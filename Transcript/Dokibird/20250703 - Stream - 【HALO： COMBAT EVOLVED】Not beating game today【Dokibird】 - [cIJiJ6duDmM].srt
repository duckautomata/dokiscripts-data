1
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:43,290
Oh, my gosh, I'm not even alive.

2
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:48,430
That's how I feel in the inside.

3
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:50,230
Sorry.

4
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:52,230
Oh, hello, everybody.

5
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:52,950
I'm sorry.

6
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:53,610
I'm sorry.

7
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,850
You guys have to wait so long today.

8
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:58,590
I am all over the place right now.

9
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:02,990
T-minus one day until... Okay, not even... It's like less than 24 hours.

10
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,310
There's less... Oh, my gosh, I forgot to... Okay.

11
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:06,910
Okay, my sound people...

12
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:12,870
Okay, so, um, my sound guy told me to do something with my audio and I forgot to do it.

13
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:14,430
So, let me do it right now.

14
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:17,350
I need to add a limiter, apparently.

15
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,550
Okay, give me a sec.

16
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:23,150
Oh, we're doing it live, everyone.

17
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:23,910
Woo!

18
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:25,390
We're doing it live!

19
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:26,650
Yippee!

20
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,070
Where is it?

21
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:31,810
Where's the mic thing?

22
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:32,590
Oh, my gosh.

23
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:33,270
Sorry, guys.

24
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:44,870
I am all over the place right now because, uh, there is a lot of stuff going on because tomorrow is my birthday concert, which is a 3D birthday concert, and there's still stuff to do for it.

25
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:46,450
So, I am all over the place.

26
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:51,030
And then after that, we have a countdown with an announcement for my birthday.

27
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:51,590
Oh, yeah.

28
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:51,810
Sorry.

29
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:56,450
In between that, I am also streaming Marvel Rivals early preview.

30
00:02:56,830 --> 00:03:04,170
In between, um, in between the birthday 3D concert and, and the countdown.

31
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:08,250
So, there's that, too.

32
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:21,790
And then, um, and then July 4th is my birthday!

33
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:24,250
And then there's also another announcement there, too!

34
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,330
But I also have something special planned for my birthday!

35
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:39,870
Okay, so, yes, there is, and then, okay, okay, so, and, um, okay, let me fix my audio stuff real quick, and then I'll let you in on more things that's going on behind the scenes.

36
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:46,330
Um, but the reason why I'm late today was, uh, because, okay, I'm gonna add a limiter, so I don't know how messed up's gonna sound.

37
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:52,730
Um, so I'm gonna sound weird for now because I am adding a limiter.

38
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:55,210
If I sound weird, I'm adding a limiter right now.

39
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:57,310
Um, okay, so, okay.

40
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:59,950
Um, my sound guy, let me know.

41
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:03,950
I don't know if they're here, but monitor your stream if anything sounds weird.

42
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:11,810
But I have, I have inputted a, uh, a limiter now, sound team.

43
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:13,650
So let me know if it's better.

44
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:16,890
Anyway, guys, um, okay.

45
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:19,090
Okay, what is this gonna say?

46
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:28,630
Okay, so, uh, yesterday, apparently, yesterday, um, the people at Mechabreak really enjoyed my Mechabreak stream.

47
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:33,870
I don't know how many views, I actually wasn't even looking at my view count yesterday, uh, for my sponsor stream.

48
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:38,690
So I wasn't even sure, like, how well it was doing last night.

49
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:51,050
But apparently, it was doing well enough that they offered me, um, two more streams, uh, to do, uh, but I had to choose the date before July 8th.

50
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:55,690
Because I was gonna do another stream on July, I was sponsored to do another stream on July 8th as well.

51
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:57,670
But they wanted me to do two more.

52
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,290
And then I said, no.

53
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:02,970
But I'll do one more, because I need the money.

54
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:06,490
I, and I, like, I did enjoy Mechabreak.

55
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:12,690
I just couldn't do two, because, um, because I just, I, I had, I had too much going on.

56
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:16,810
I, but I was like, I was like, I'll take one, because I need the money.

57
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:27,330
I, guys, no, you will understand why I, I'm saying yes to all these sponsors.

58
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:32,270
You will understand after the concert, I'll reveal it all.

59
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:37,930
Because, thank you for the Akasupa, thank you, thank you.

60
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:41,510
Kat beef there for the lockdown live, the time zones.

61
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:43,710
But anyway, good luck for the concert and relax.

62
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:45,830
Even their scuff, it just makes it the money.

63
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:48,230
Thank you for the Akasupa, thank you, thank you.

64
00:05:49,230 --> 00:06:01,330
But, like, um, so, they really enjoyed the, uh, Mechabreak stream that they actually asked me, um, if, uh, if I was willing to do two more, and I was like, I'll do one more.

65
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:04,550
So, I'm doing another Mechabreak stream on Sunday.

66
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:10,750
And I'll do another, I'm gonna do another, I'm gonna do one on Sunday, and then I'm gonna do another one on Tuesday.

67
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:22,910
So, uh, those would be my two Mechabreak streams that they asked me to, well, I mean, I was originally gonna be doing two, they, they asked me to do two, but they wanted to add two more, so I would have done four in total.

68
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:25,110
But I said no, because that was actually too much.

69
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:31,210
Because I also might have another sponsor on Monday as well.

70
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:34,230
I also didn't want to do, like, mecha break, mecha break, mecha break.

71
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:35,650
Like, three days of mecha break.

72
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:40,710
So I made it so that, you know, I spaced it out a little bit.

73
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:43,010
You know, one day is a little bit.

74
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:46,610
So, like, I'm all over the place right now.

75
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:50,310
I'm, like, I'm really, like, a bundle of stress at the moment.

76
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:51,570
I'm, like, a little stress ball.

77
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:54,350
Like, you squeeze me and then I just, I'm just stressed.

78
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:59,470
Like, you can't even squeeze the ball because there's just so much, like, tension in there.

79
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:04,130
That's how fucked up I am at the moment.

80
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:12,270
Anyway, um, Anton, thank you for the super chat.

81
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:12,770
Thank you.

82
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:13,530
Thank you.

83
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:18,650
Surely she's raising all this money to buy a rice cooker, right, dragons?

84
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:21,210
Thank you for the super chat, Anton.

85
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:21,770
Thank you.

86
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:22,290
Thank you.

87
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:23,090
Oh, so, yes.

88
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:26,670
But, by the way, the reason why I was late was because my cleaner was here today.

89
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:31,850
Um, I have a monthly cleaner, uh, as suggested by you guys because it is, I don't have the time to clean my place.

90
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:34,990
Um, so she comes in here once every month.

91
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:38,130
Um, and she was a little late today.

92
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:42,450
Uh, but, uh, basically, um, okay.

93
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:48,530
So, before I go into the cleaner story, we're going to the dat- Okay, no.

94
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:49,670
This is a whole arc.

95
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:51,710
I'll go into the whole arc of this story.

96
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:56,470
It's- it's a story that goes on, um, that has its own little plot line.

97
00:07:56,670 --> 00:08:00,910
So, if you guys didn't know, Dad was at, uh, the dog sitter.

98
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:06,750
And, uh, because, uh, Daddy needs her me time.

99
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:07,210
So.

100
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:13,910
And, like, I really wanted to sleep in.

101
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:17,170
And I really, really needed, like, time for myself.

102
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:18,430
And I needed to sleep in.

103
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:21,610
So, I put him at the dog sitter for two days.

104
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:22,690
Also, Waffle Maker!

105
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:23,830
Welcome to Tomato Farm!

106
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:24,510
Welcome, welcome!

107
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:29,190
Anyway, so, like, so the story goes, he was at the dog sitter.

108
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:38,470
So, you know how yesterday, um, I couldn't tell the story yesterday because it was a sponsor, and I couldn't, like, you know, have to focus on the game itself because I got paid to.

109
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:51,190
Um, so I can't really, like, diverge into, you know, you can tell I was trying to avoid saying, like, Transformers, like, you know, when we were Falcon, I'd be like, Transformers, Roland, oh my god, we're basically Starscream and, like, his gang.

110
00:08:51,890 --> 00:09:04,390
When we were doing a 3v3, I wanted to be, like, Decepticons, go, and be like, let's go, we're basically Starscream's gang right now.

111
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:18,770
I really wanted to, oh my god, I wanted to say all that, but I couldn't because, obviously, I had to, um, I had to, like, you know, avoid copyright stuff.

112
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:38,530
We were, like, the Seekers and everything, uh, but I couldn't say that, so I had to avoid all, like, the copyright stuff while, while I was trying to talk about Mechabrick.

113
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:45,150
Um, I'm surprised I got away with Chigs, Chicks, Dig, Giant, Robo.

114
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:47,070
I think they just didn't know where that song came from.

115
00:09:49,770 --> 00:10:02,390
Because, like, in the, in the briefing, we were supposed to avoid copyright stuff and, like, you know, trying to sing copyright music, but I think they didn't know where that song came from, so I got away with seeing that, like,

116
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:24,030
anyway, um, anyway, so, uh, basically, on Canada Day, um, if you guys weren't there for yesterday's Elden Ring stream, I was saying how, like, oh, um, I didn't, I don't know if I should do anything on Canada Day, because, like, you know, uh, it's always super crowded and,

117
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:43,090
like, I'm just there to buy overpriced food and, like, it's so hot and, like, I'm just gonna be in a line for a while just to get my overpriced food and there's not really much to do there other than listening to, like, live music and, like, just community stuff and things for kids.

118
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:48,370
And then I still, and then, guess who went out and bought overpriced?

119
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,250
And guess what happened?

120
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:58,210
I was like, you know, you know what?

121
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:00,050
Okay, it's so fucked up.

122
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:00,970
It was so fucked up.

123
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:01,710
I regretted it.

124
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:04,150
I was like, I'm not gonna do it because I know what's gonna happen.

125
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:15,210
I even knew I was, I, like, I can't predict it was gonna happen until I grabbed, like, the step-by-step of what's gonna happen if I ever, if I go out to Canada, for Canada Day, on, like, those Canada Day festivities.

126
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:26,550
And, like, past Doki warned future Doki that that was gonna happen and I still did it anyway.

127
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:35,210
So, basically, I was like, okay, I still have a couple of hours before the, uh, uh, the, the sponsor.

128
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:36,410
So, you know what?

129
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:40,750
Let me just, yeah, there's, like, a special event going on for Canada Day near me.

130
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:46,790
So, let me just take an Uber there and just, you know, see how we're, what, like, oh, there seems to be some good-ass food trucks there.

131
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:48,170
Let me go check it out.

132
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:55,250
So, I, you know, took an Uber to, like, this place where they were running some Canada Day, like, events and stuff.

133
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:57,810
And then there was, like, live music and stuff like that.

134
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:58,930
And then there were food trucks.

135
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:10,050
So, my goal was to just really go to the food trucks because I also thought there would be, like, stuff people would sell, like, like, a little miniature, uh, how did you fall for the tourist trap?

136
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:12,350
Liam, thank you for the super chat.

137
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:12,770
Thank you.

138
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:13,210
Thank you.

139
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:15,030
It's not even a tourist trap.

140
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:16,690
It's a Canadian trap.

141
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:21,110
Like, it's a Canadian trap.

142
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:23,610
I, oh, I could have just celebrated at home.

143
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:25,010
I don't even care that much.

144
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:26,070
I could just Uber Eats.

145
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:43,650
But anyway, uh, anyway, so, um, Um, so, I was, like, I was, like, okay, I'm gonna go there and, like, you know, just, you know, check it out And just see, just, you know, maybe there will be some good food trucks.

146
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:44,530
Maybe there'll be stuff to buy.

147
00:12:44,890 --> 00:13:00,590
So, I got there and then, like, literally, there's no, it's just, like, if things for children and, like, families to do And like, it's like, oh man, join this community club for like, I don't fucking know, for like some dance or whatever.

148
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:05,590
Like this is like some community clubs to join and stuff like that.

149
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:10,370
Like, oh, want to visit this ancient, like vintage bus museum?

150
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:19,630
And then there's like, you know, oh, look at this like university.

151
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:26,510
University advertisement booth where like, spin this wheel to get a free item.

152
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:30,030
And then like, you know, I walked out and I was like, oh, there's the food trucks.

153
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:34,710
And then, oh my God, there was, I was like, oh, the line is not too bad.

154
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:47,810
Like, oh, that, like I have, hmm, I have two and a half, I have, let's see, two hours before I have to get home and, you know, get prepared for my sponsor.

155
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:57,930
And then, and then, so I was just like, all right, let me just line up for this, line up at this food truck.

156
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:01,690
This seems like a really good food truck too, after looking through all the trucks that were there.

157
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:19,990
And then, I stood in that line and then I waited and I waited and I waited and I waited and I waited for an entire hour.

158
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:38,630
And then, I was just like, this morning, I was like, guys, I waited for an hour for a while and I went, I waited for an hour and the queue was coming, but anyway, it hanged for me.

159
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:45,990
So, I was like, dude, and got like, boys and I was like, boys and I literally sat down for that chauffeur.

160
00:14:46,470 --> 00:15:02,290
And then, at that time, boy So I also bought chicken nuggies, too, because I was like, I waited a fucking hour for this food truck.

161
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:06,610
And I was like, I'm gonna fucking, I'm gonna spend money.

162
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:09,810
I'm fucking, if I'm gonna eat, I'm gonna eat.

163
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:16,330
If I waited an hour, I'm not buying one item.

164
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:25,350
I'm not, I'm not buying one item if I waited an entire fucking hour.

165
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:30,390
So, it didn't even look that long.

166
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:33,050
I was like, oh, this line doesn't look too bad.

167
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:39,050
And then, I also bought some shitty popcorn, too.

168
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:40,530
That's what made me so sad.

169
00:15:43,170 --> 00:16:02,070
Anyway, by the time, by the time I bought, I got the food, and I got the food, by the time I got the food, and, um, and everything, it was already 8 p.m.

170
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:07,050
And I was walking, because, okay, and then, the place I was at, they closed down the road.

171
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:13,910
So, I had to, like, walk back to the road with the cars to get an Uber back home.

172
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:18,430
And by the time I got home, it was, like, 8.30.

173
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:22,390
And, like, my, my sponsor's stream was at 9 p.m.

174
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:34,190
And so, I literally went to this Canada Day event, went to the food trucks, lined up, bought my food, and then I went home.

175
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:39,270
Happy Canada Day to me.

176
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:45,830
Um, sorry, let me, correction, bought my overpriced fucking food.

177
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:49,110
That could have got for cheaper on Uber Eats.

178
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:51,630
And, and then I went home.

179
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:53,970
Happy Canada Day.

180
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:01,310
So, um, anyway.

181
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:08,870
So, yeah, you know, past Doki predicted that this was gonna happen, and then future Doki was like, no, it'll be different.

182
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:11,090
Like, she was like, oh, man, you know what?

183
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:16,270
I should, like, go outside and, like, you know, enjoy, um, the festivities.

184
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:26,030
Anyway, so, yes, so that's part one of the story.

185
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:30,650
Part two of the story is that... Jay, welcome to Tomato Farm.

186
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:31,370
Welcome, welcome.

187
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:40,990
Part two of the story is basically, um, since dad was at the dog sitter, he actually came back late last night.

188
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:46,750
Um, but just before my sponsor stream, he came back.

189
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:51,650
And the thing is, okay, so it's his usual dog sitter that he really likes.

190
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:56,150
So I was like, oh, hey, yeah, um, was he, like, was it fine?

191
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:59,310
And she was like, yeah, she was, like, did he, I was like, did he poop and pee?

192
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:01,430
And she was like, yeah, he, uh, yeah, he did.

193
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:03,450
He pooped and pee at 8 p.m.

194
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:05,390
And I was like, okay, so I don't have to walk him after that.

195
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:12,810
So, um, the thing is, so, there's a little setup to this, to the story.

196
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:15,190
Let me set the story up for you guys.

197
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:22,710
Before he was at the dog sitter, um, I had one can of his food left.

198
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:26,030
And this is, like, a specially prescribed canned food.

199
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:28,650
And I had one left for one day.

200
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:30,710
But he was at there for two days.

201
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:39,710
So, I asked the dog sitter if she could buy, uh, a new set of, a new set of wet food, uh, for him.

202
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:41,550
And you could get it at any veterinarian.

203
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:43,410
She went to two veterinarians.

204
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:47,750
And they didn't have the usual canned food that he gets.

205
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:48,390
Like, the flavor.

206
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:49,350
It's the same brand.

207
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:51,010
But he didn't, they didn't have his flavor.

208
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,150
Which was beef and vegetables.

209
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:56,810
So, um, they only had beef.

210
00:18:57,270 --> 00:19:01,290
So, the thing is, like, my dog sitter already went to two vets.

211
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:05,870
And this was the first time where, like, they didn't have, um, the usual.

212
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:09,770
Well, so, uh, so, uh, he only had beef.

213
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:11,490
So, I was like, okay, that's fine.

214
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:12,530
Um, that's fine.

215
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:13,990
It's just for, like, an extra day.

216
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:15,790
You know, it's just for, like, one day.

217
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:16,910
That should be fine.

218
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:23,610
Um, so, the thing about the...

219
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:37,730
Okay, so, before I explain to you what was wrong with the beef wet food can, let me just say, the day, the...

220
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:37,950
Today.

221
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:45,690
Me, thank you for the 10 gifted chips.

222
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:47,070
Thank you, thank you.

223
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:50,410
Today.

224
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:52,150
So, he did the usual thing.

225
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:55,450
He woke me up in the morning for food.

226
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:57,810
And I was like, and I opened the can of beef.

227
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:02,650
Because his, uh, usual beef and vegetables is coming tomorrow.

228
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:04,450
Um, because it takes a couple...

229
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:06,750
I ordered it off of Amazon.

230
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:15,710
Um, just because, like, I didn't want to, you know, I didn't want to book an Uber trip to the vet that's, like, his usual vet that's, like, you know, like, 15 minutes away.

231
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:18,710
So, I figured I'd just Amazon order it because it's just more convenient.

232
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:23,510
Because it's just, you know, I just thought it was more convenient to just Amazon it.

233
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:30,890
Um, and so, um, I opened his can of beef, wet food.

234
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:32,390
And then I opened it.

235
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:36,450
I was like, whoa, this is, like, super chunky and, like, filling.

236
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:42,830
And, like, I usually give him half a can for his, uh, usual, like, beef and vegetables.

237
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:47,710
Uh, for this one, I gave him one-third because it was a lot.

238
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:49,230
It was, like, so much.

239
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:50,230
I was like, holy shit.

240
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:55,390
Like, this is a lot for, um, for, like, for his meal.

241
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:58,690
So, he got one-third versus half a can.

242
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:03,610
And then I went back to sleep because I was like, you know, he wakes me at a fucking six in the morning.

243
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:10,190
Um, he wakes me up at six in the morning to eat.

244
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:24,030
And then usually, how his routine is like, is that after, after I, you know, um, feed him in the morning, he lets me sleep for at least three to four hours.

245
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:29,510
So, he lets me sleep in for three to four more hours before he needs to do walkie time.

246
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:31,430
So.

247
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:37,030
So, he woke me up again.

248
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:39,850
He woke me up at nine.

249
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:41,610
But I was like, no, this is too much.

250
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:42,790
I need to go back to sleep.

251
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:46,650
And then he woke me up again at ten.

252
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:49,130
And then I was like, okay, that's fine.

253
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:50,330
Like, that's okay.

254
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:53,450
But then I was like, oh, I'm, like, so overworked and everything.

255
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:58,030
I really, really needed a shower before I take him for his walks.

256
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:04,430
So, I took a shower because he has let me do that before.

257
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:06,250
Like, you know, he could wait, usually.

258
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:10,010
And then I got out of the shower.

259
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:13,110
And then I was like, what's that smell?

260
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:23,910
I was like, oh, no.

261
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:27,510
Oh, no.

262
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:33,090
And so, I was like, where did you do it, Dad?

263
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:43,810
And then I went to the front door, the front of my door.

264
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:52,470
And he pooped three times at the front of my door.

265
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:57,390
And they weren't his usual little doggy poops.

266
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:02,710
They were, like, really big boy poops.

267
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:05,050
And I was like, what?

268
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:07,670
I was like, that came out of you?

269
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:17,870
I was like, they were, it was not even, like, his usual poop size, too.

270
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:22,990
Two of them were absolutely big boy poops.

271
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:26,210
And I was like, are you okay?

272
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:29,790
I was like, I was like, oh, what?

273
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:43,290
And then, two of them were on this, okay, I, okay, and then, the thing is, oh, my gosh.

274
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:48,010
I have a really cute little carpet that's shaped like a bear.

275
00:23:51,550 --> 00:24:07,350
And he, two of the poops were on the cute little bear carpet that I have, that I used as, like, a rug, that, sorry, the little cute bear rug that I bought to be, you know, used to, like, wipe my shoes and everything.

276
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:14,370
And he, he, like, pooped two of the poops on the little cute bear.

277
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:22,710
But then the third poop didn't fit on the cute bear carpet, so he pooped on, he pooped beside it because they were too big.

278
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:24,130
It didn't fit.

279
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:33,130
Carl, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

280
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:38,950
And then, and then I was like, oh, my God.

281
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:43,270
So I was like, well, guys, you still need your walkies.

282
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:58,530
So I, like, picked up the poop, and I, like, took the poop with me to the dog park, and then I took him to the dog park, and then I noticed, I was like, wait, did you pee, too?

283
00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:02,950
Because I freaked out, I was like, wait, if he pooped, what if he also peed?

284
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:10,770
So then I, like, monitored him when he, like, got to the dog park, and then I noticed, that's not a lot of pee.

285
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:17,030
That's not a lot.

286
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:22,430
But then, he also pooped two more times.

287
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:31,930
Two more times at the dog park.

288
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:35,130
I was like, but they were, like, his usual poop size.

289
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:37,610
They were the usual size, by the way.

290
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:40,310
Not the ginormous big boy ones.

291
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:41,830
It was his usual size.

292
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:44,630
But he still did it two more times.

293
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:48,110
I was like, oh, my, I'm, okay.

294
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:59,690
Anyway, so, there was thought there would be a rug cleaning fun, so, here, Shady, thank you in the super chat.

295
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:01,030
Thank you, thank you.

296
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:19,050
Anyway, so then, I went home, and I was like, and I looked down, and my cute little, bear rug, and I noticed the stain.

297
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:28,470
Not only, I think he peed on it, and then he started, because I'm

298
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:36,720
on top of it, so, it's okay, guys.

299
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,220
I got it on, I got it at Daiso.

300
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:42,140
At least it was cheap, but it was very cute.

301
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:44,180
It was very awesome.

302
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,080
I was like, is this salvageable?

303
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,480
And I was like, this isn't.

304
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:51,620
I was like, I'm not cleaning this.

305
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,100
I'm throwing this away.

306
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:57,340
It's not salvageable.

307
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,680
It's not.

308
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,220
I threw it away, guys.

309
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,880
There's no rug cleaning fund.

310
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,140
It's just, it's gone.

311
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:18,600
It's in the goddamn, it's in the fucking trash downstairs.

312
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,100
Ready to be collected.

313
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:28,480
But yes, and then I was like, I was like, oh my god, I'm sorry.

314
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,920
And then I texted the dog sitter.

315
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:40,240
I was just like, okay, so, he had an accident, this morning, and he's never had an accident before.

316
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:43,220
He was, he's never done this before.

317
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:47,720
So I was like, I was like, I was like, what happened?

318
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:59,080
And then the dog sitter was like, oh, I think I might have overfed him last night with his new dog food.

319
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:22,540
I was like, he's like, yeah, I gave him half the can of, I gave him half, half the can, because I told, like, because she knows, usually, usually, it's half for his other canned food, but the beef and veggies is like, a lot less filling.

320
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,460
I guess, it's a lot less filling.

321
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:29,080
So she gave half a can of just pure beef.

322
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:29,780
And,

323
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:55,850
so, I was just like, oh my god, I got so scared that he's gonna have another act, I got so scared, I like, walked him before, I walked him at like, at like, five, because I knew the cleaner was still here, because, but okay, the cleaner was still here,

324
00:28:55,890 --> 00:29:00,570
so then I was like, okay, I need to walk you, I'm gonna walk you three times a day, because I'm scared.

325
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:20,970
I'm like, but anyway, I was like, I wasn't crying about it, but obviously I was like, in distress about it to my manager, because I, you know, I went through like, a lot of grief in the morning, having to deal with that, because I've never, he's never had an accident before,

326
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:36,990
ever since he got like, you know, potty trained, he's never had an accident before, so I was like, and like, he's never, you know, he would let, I knew his schedule, and he knew, he knows my schedule, and like, so I was like, freaking out, because I was just like,

327
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:40,050
I was like, why did this happen?

328
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:45,330
I was like, I'm so sad, this happened.

329
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:51,110
Like, he's never had an accident before.

330
00:29:51,910 --> 00:30:01,790
Oh, and then, you know, obviously, I think I was also like, super over, like, I'm like, really stressed out and overworked at the moment, because of like, the birthday week and everything.

331
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:20,850
And so like, obviously, I felt really bad, because I was like, I'm sorry, dad, if I wasn't so tired in the morning, and felt like I felt so dirty, I would have just walked you, instead of taking a shower first.

332
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:22,510
I'm sorry.

333
00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:29,090
And like, the worst part is that he barks at everything.

334
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:39,490
So like, I didn't realize it were emergency, I have to go barks, because he always barks at the smallest fucking thing.

335
00:30:39,810 --> 00:30:44,210
So like, if every time, like, everything is an emergency to him.

336
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:47,370
So when will I know when it's an actual emergency?

337
00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:53,610
Like, the dad that cried, whoop, like, everything is an emergency to him.

338
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:59,470
So like, how did I know this was like, a real, real emergency, where he has to go?

339
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:02,870
Because he's done this to me so many times in the morning.

340
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:08,390
Where, but he used to let me shower, in the past.

341
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:12,330
It's all an emergency.

342
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:19,570
Caleb, thank you.

343
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:21,110
Welcome to Tomato Fire.

344
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:21,990
Welcome, welcome.

345
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:23,170
Unlucky.

346
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:25,090
Thank you for the super chat.

347
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:25,610
Thank you.

348
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:26,110
Thank you.

349
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:28,150
That didn't just do his business.

350
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:30,630
That was chemical warfare of all kinds.

351
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:32,990
The poor bear and the house.

352
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:34,930
Thank you for the super chat.

353
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:35,610
Thank you.

354
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:36,590
Thank you.

355
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:46,070
So, anyway, so that was, that was the dad story.

356
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:47,550
Now, part three.

357
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:53,010
But that was, part three is shorter.

358
00:31:53,330 --> 00:32:00,170
And that was why, the cleaner, took a lot longer than usual, to clean the place.

359
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:03,050
Because I had her clean the area.

360
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:03,810
The,

361
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:15,730
the area where he decided to go to do an emergency stop at.

362
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:22,550
That's why, that's why it went on.

363
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:24,930
Um, the, the hazard zone.

364
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:30,070
That's why the cleaner took a lot longer, um, to finish up.

365
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:33,570
Because I had her, like, extra clean in that area.

366
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:43,790
But yeah, that, that is the whole story.

367
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:47,210
I, I had so many things I wanted to talk about.

368
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:53,510
But like, this took up, this one story, took up 30 minutes of the stream.

369
00:32:58,130 --> 00:32:59,430
So, yeah.

370
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:02,990
Um, uh, Carl, thank you for the super chat.

371
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:04,070
Thank you, thank you.

372
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:06,370
When I gotta go, I gotta go.

373
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:07,950
And I mean it.

374
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:09,790
Thank you for the super chat.

375
00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:10,350
Thank you.

376
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:11,250
Thank you.

377
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:13,930
so, yes.

378
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:14,690
So, yes.

379
00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:16,730
That, I mean, that could be a data.

380
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:19,490
I mean, that's basically a data update.

381
00:33:19,890 --> 00:33:23,710
Right now, he's just, he's just sleeping next to me at the moment.

382
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:27,170
As if he didn't like, you know, fuck up my entire morning.

383
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:30,570
Oh, I guess.

384
00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:35,170
But yes, he is, um, he is basically sleeping beside me.

385
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:38,490
Anyway, we're not finishing Halo today.

386
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:42,130
Um, just because I am very busy.

387
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:44,130
Very, very busy.

388
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:47,490
Um, there's a lot of stuff I have to do for tomorrow's concert.

389
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:50,330
And also the birthday stream on the 4th.

390
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:55,650
And also the announce, the, the countdown slash announcement, uh, tomorrow.

391
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:58,110
After the concert.

392
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:02,510
So, in the end, a lot of stuff came up.

393
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:06,050
Like, a lot of like, I guess like technical difficulties.

394
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:09,530
Or, and like things I need to like, solve and stuff.

395
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:16,590
So, um, um, I have to like, uh, work on that after the stream.

396
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:18,430
So I can't do a super long endurance stream.

397
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:21,170
And I also have like, a teensy little bit of a headache.

398
00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:25,290
Uh, I didn't, I'm gonna, I'm gonna take like, uh, botana real quick.

399
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:27,090
Uh, for my tiny headache.

400
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:28,090
It's not that bad.

401
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:28,990
It's just teeny tiny.

402
00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:31,250
Like I could, it's like, it's not even, I wouldn't say a headache.

403
00:34:31,430 --> 00:34:33,330
It's like, a pressure, you know?

404
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:37,070
Like, you know, it's like, not really a headache, but just like a slight pressure.

405
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:41,190
Um, on the sat, like on the eyebrows type deal.

406
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:46,750
Uh, but like, yeah, that's why, uh, I totally, uh, that's why I can't do a super long stream today.

407
00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:50,290
Most likely we'll just try and finish one level, which is the library.

408
00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:53,530
apparently the fucking worst level in this game.

409
00:34:57,450 --> 00:35:00,350
It's the, it's the worst level of this game.

410
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:02,090
So like, I'm ready.

411
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:04,470
I'm ready to play it.

412
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:13,360
Um, but yes, um, I hope you enjoyed my, my life update.

413
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:19,940
It was, it was, oh, it was definitely a wild ride for me the whole day.

414
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,460
Um, let's see.

415
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,400
Oh my gosh.

416
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:26,380
Also, I'll give you guys a little thing I want to talk to you guys about.

417
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:30,480
I'll give you guys another little, uh, life update that I wanted to talk to you guys about.

418
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:35,720
Like, I think like yesterday, but I forgot to, but, um, okay, so we got a scam email.

419
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:43,080
Like, uh, my manager sent me this like scam email, uh, because they're like, oh, hey, like, what is this?

420
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,460
And it's based, I'll read you the email out.

421
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:47,880
And like, at first I like freaked out.

422
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,360
Cause I was like, what the fuck?

423
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,400
I didn't realize it was a scam at first.

424
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:52,560
Cause I thought it was legit.

425
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,560
Cause I'd never seen this before.

426
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:59,120
So, um, let me see.

427
00:35:59,120 --> 00:35:59,880
Where is this?

428
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:02,460
Oh, wait, did I, did they, uh, oh, here you go.

429
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:03,060
Let me tell you.

430
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:12,160
Dear creator, I've become aware that your recent content features my music, which has been used without proper authorization.

431
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:14,280
Well, I hope this is an oversight.

432
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:19,460
It nonetheless represents a direct infringement of my exclusive copyright to this work.

433
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:25,600
I'm genuinely interested in resolving this situation amicably, uh, as soon as possible.

434
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:31,060
However, I must inform you that shouldn't, an amicable resolution not be reached.

435
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:36,900
I've already taken steps by contacting Astra and their legal department for further, further actions.

436
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:48,460
In such a scenario, you need to interact directly with their legal team, as well as paste, as well as face potential sanctions for copyright infringement that could be applied to your YouTube channel.

437
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,540
I trust you're aware of the consequences.

438
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,980
Accumulating three copyright strikes will lead to indefinite channel suspension.

439
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,900
My aim is to avoid such an outcome.

440
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:01,300
So, like, I was like, when?

441
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:12,740
I always try to Google royalty-free music.

442
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:17,180
So, I was like, what the fuck?

443
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:20,120
like, and then I was like, when did this happen?

444
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,180
What the fuck did I have?

445
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:28,120
Unless it was karaoke, but like, even then, like, I use Carafun for my karaoke and that's, like, legal.

446
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:37,440
Like, like, I pay, like, a monthly subscription to that to make sure that, like, I can sing these songs during karaoke.

447
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:40,400
So, I was like, so confused.

448
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:44,160
And then, I Googled the email.

449
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:51,260
Like, okay, and the email was from a Japanese, like, email, like, domain thing.

450
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:55,780
And I was like, oh shit, but Japanese people take, like, copyright very seriously.

451
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,920
So I was like, oh shit, maybe it's legit.

452
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:00,920
Because it was like, dot JP, like, the email address.

453
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:05,160
So I was like, oh my gosh, maybe, like, it is serious.

454
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,000
Like, but when the fuck did I use music?

455
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,100
Like, um, like, illegally.

456
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:18,180
And then, and then, so, uh, so then I, I, like, Googled the, the, like, everything he wrote.

457
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:21,440
And then it was literally a, it was a scam.

458
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:21,760
Like,

459
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:29,090
it was, it was, I'll link it.

460
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:30,290
I found a Reddit one.

461
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:43,490
And, like, they literally just, they basically, um, it's like the same, almost the same email, but they just change whatever the, like, music company is.

462
00:38:45,310 --> 00:38:48,190
And everyone's like, oh yeah, I got the same email too.

463
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:54,290
And yeah, so I'll, I'll show you guys, like, this basically, the Reddit thread I saw.

464
00:38:54,450 --> 00:39:06,230
And it was literally the same, like, the same, like, the same, similar subject and similar, like, um, um, paragraphs and stuff.

465
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:08,630
Except they changed, like, one to two words.

466
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:14,810
So I was like, oh, okay, thank God.

467
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:15,170
All right.

468
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:17,510
I knew I didn't break any laws.

469
00:39:18,210 --> 00:39:23,250
But I doubted myself because the email came from a Japanese email.

470
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:27,150
So I doubted myself because I was like, oh, shit, no.

471
00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:29,770
They, they take that shit very seriously.

472
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:33,770
So, but it was a fake Japanese email.

473
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:39,870
And, so I was like, God damn it.

474
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:45,090
I almost fell for it just because it came from a .JP email.

475
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:50,990
Like, if it, if it didn't come from a .JP, I would have not taken this seriously.

476
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:53,870
Like, right off the bat, I'd be like, that's a scam.

477
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:58,670
Like, but I second, I, like, second doubted myself.

478
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:00,370
I've actually doubted myself.

479
00:40:00,370 --> 00:40:03,350
I was like, oh my God, when did I do this?

480
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:07,930
I was like, I was just like, I was like, when did I do that?

481
00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:09,790
I don't remember me.

482
00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:12,450
I must have, though, because the email is .JP.

483
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:20,750
So, so, so, like, it, like, I, they almost got me.

484
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:26,750
They all, they, they almost got me, guys.

485
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:30,190
Um, yeah, I, like, doubted myself there.

486
00:40:30,310 --> 00:40:31,110
Anyway, I'm sorry.

487
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:32,770
This was a very long tangent.

488
00:40:32,770 --> 00:40:34,290
Like, I went through a lot today.

489
00:40:34,530 --> 00:40:35,870
Uh, but let's play it.

490
00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:36,850
Let's play Halo!

491
00:40:36,850 --> 00:40:37,210
Halo!

492
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:39,430
I'm sorry to everybody that's been waiting for this game.

493
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:43,510
Waiting for me to end my long-ass Satsunan portion.

494
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:44,330
Yeah.

495
00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:47,310
Now it's actual Halo time.

496
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:48,190
Don't worry.

497
00:40:48,350 --> 00:40:49,310
Now you can tap back in.

498
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:50,650
We're actually playing Halo now.

499
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:52,730
Also, let me get more water.

500
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:53,610
I'll be right back.

501
00:40:56,350 --> 00:40:57,670
It's loading, by the way.

502
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:05,500
Alright.

503
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:06,440
It's loading.

504
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,060
I'm just getting more water.

505
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:10,840
Uh, Admiral, thank you, the super chat.

506
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:11,160
Thank you.

507
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:11,600
Thank you.

508
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,040
You say you're ready for the library?

509
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:13,640
You ain't.

510
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:15,320
Look on the bright side, though, Doki.

511
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:17,200
You're not playing this on Legendary.

512
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:17,980
Good luck.

513
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:18,880
You got this.

514
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,440
But make sure use of everything on that level.

515
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:23,480
You need to.

516
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:25,100
Oh, my God.

517
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:30,440
I'm, I'm a little worried.

518
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:33,600
Alright.

519
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,640
Our mission today is that...

520
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:39,440
Oh, sorry.

521
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:42,660
Like, it's just so iconic.

522
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:44,280
Oh.

523
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:46,440
Oh.

524
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:48,980
Alright.

525
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:51,160
Uh, Clorox, thank you for the super chat.

526
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:51,520
Thank you.

527
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:52,140
Thank you.

528
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:54,040
God, I don't know how ready I am.

529
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:55,040
I...

530
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:59,760
Most likely, I'm not ready, to be fair.

531
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,240
Mentally, I'm not there.

532
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:06,140
I know mentally I'm not there right now.

533
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:07,400
Alright.

534
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,180
Wait, where am I?

535
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:13,420
Oh, shit.

536
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,160
Okay, I was gonna say...

537
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:16,670
Wait, is this...

538
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:20,640
Okay, wait.

539
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:22,260
Which one is...

540
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:23,500
Which one is...

541
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,220
Okay, yeah, this is the...

542
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:25,320
Wait.

543
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:27,020
Which one is the...

544
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:28,680
Low quality...

545
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:32,400
Wait, you can't tell which one is the low quality graphics.

546
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,400
I actually can't tell.

547
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:35,240
I...

548
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:38,160
Oh, shit.

549
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:38,920
Screen is back.

550
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:39,880
Oh, fuck.

551
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:40,560
Okay, that's good.

552
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:41,000
That's fine.

553
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:41,900
That's fine.

554
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,020
I forgot to...

555
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:43,860
Okay, guys.

556
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:44,460
I need help.

557
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:46,620
I can't tell which one is low quality.

558
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:47,460
I...

559
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:49,980
I can't tell which one is the remaster.

560
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:51,260
This is the...

561
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:51,980
Is this...

562
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:52,380
Is this...

563
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:52,780
Follow me.

564
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:54,300
Okay, no.

565
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:54,820
This isn't.

566
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:55,860
This is the low quality.

567
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:56,600
Okay, never mind.

568
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,620
This is the original OG graphics.

569
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:00,720
Okay, I figured it out.

570
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:02,780
I was struggling a little bit.

571
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:03,820
Oh, my God.

572
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:07,260
Oh, my God.

573
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:07,820
Where is he?

574
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:09,100
I have to follow him!

575
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:11,640
Oh, my God.

576
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:13,560
Okay.

577
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:15,740
I need to follow him.

578
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:16,240
Where is he?

579
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:16,960
Oh, there he is.

580
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:18,420
Quick, write a message.

581
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:19,140
Oh, wait.

582
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,580
I didn't give him the super chat ticket.

583
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:23,440
I have to parkour?

584
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:25,940
Oh, my God.

585
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,680
Okay, let's figure this out.

586
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:34,100
Oh, my God.

587
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:35,600
Oh, my God.

588
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:36,500
Get out of here!

589
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:38,700
Oh, there's a door.

590
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:39,300
Oh, my God.

591
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:39,780
There's a door.

592
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:40,860
There's a door.

593
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:44,640
Oh.

594
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:46,720
Wait.

595
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:47,560
Okay.

596
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:50,280
Okay, I can do this.

597
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:51,100
Okay, now I know.

598
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:52,000
Now I know.

599
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:52,920
I know now.

600
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:55,460
I know now.

601
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:59,300
I hate this already.

602
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:01,780
I hate this already.

603
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:03,580
Holy fuck!

604
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:07,500
I don't even know where he went!

605
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:08,880
Okay.

606
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,180
Oh, my God.

607
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:13,200
Will I have enough?

608
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:15,320
How do I find a shotgun?

609
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:19,440
Will I even have enough fucking ammo?

610
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:27,040
Oh, my God.

611
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:28,480
Oh, my God.

612
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:31,360
Word of...

613
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:32,420
What is he doing?

614
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:35,120
Where is he?

615
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:36,560
Where's my buddy?

616
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:42,400
I'm following as much as I can follow.

617
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:45,120
Oh, my God.

618
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:45,680
I

619
00:44:49,250 --> 00:44:52,570
didn't do this again!

620
00:44:53,030 --> 00:44:53,730
Oh, my God.

621
00:44:53,790 --> 00:44:54,650
What was my checkpoint?

622
00:44:55,070 --> 00:44:56,210
I don't even know!

623
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:02,720
Oh!

624
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:06,340
Oh, no!

625
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:10,160
No!

626
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:11,760
Checkpoint!

627
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:13,140
Oh!

628
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:15,960
Oh,

629
00:45:19,210 --> 00:45:19,490
my God.

630
00:45:19,630 --> 00:45:20,510
I'm already low HP.

631
00:45:22,130 --> 00:45:24,150
Oh my god, I'm dead.

632
00:45:24,350 --> 00:45:25,190
I'm dead.

633
00:45:26,750 --> 00:45:28,210
I'll take my own life.

634
00:45:29,910 --> 00:45:32,350
I go out on my own terms.

635
00:45:32,970 --> 00:45:35,670
Thank you for the super chat.

636
00:45:35,910 --> 00:45:36,790
Thank you.

637
00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:39,270
I can't see on this level.

638
00:45:41,270 --> 00:45:42,850
I understand now.

639
00:45:43,830 --> 00:45:44,950
Guys, I understand.

640
00:45:46,270 --> 00:45:46,810
Okay.

641
00:45:49,870 --> 00:45:51,670
I understand now.

642
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:53,670
Oh my god.

643
00:45:53,930 --> 00:45:55,690
How am I already getting hit?

644
00:45:57,470 --> 00:45:58,110
How?

645
00:46:09,030 --> 00:46:11,650
Oh my god, how do I win this level?

646
00:46:11,950 --> 00:46:13,310
How do I win?

647
00:46:14,170 --> 00:46:15,830
How do I win?

648
00:46:16,870 --> 00:46:18,930
How do I get out of

649
00:46:22,890 --> 00:46:22,930
here?

650
00:46:23,770 --> 00:46:24,810
Oh my god, there he is.

651
00:46:25,690 --> 00:46:25,930
Oh!

652
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:26,630
Oh,

653
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:34,800
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

654
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:35,720
We must get up there.

655
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:41,540
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

656
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:42,060
No!

657
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:44,400
No!

658
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:48,260
Oh, the door's here!

659
00:46:50,620 --> 00:46:51,720
I hate this.

660
00:46:51,820 --> 00:46:53,040
I hate this level.

661
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:54,460
I hate this level!

662
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:59,140
Oh my god.

663
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:00,400
Oh, fuck!

664
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:02,900
I don't have ammo!

665
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:03,440
There's

666
00:47:07,590 --> 00:47:08,170
no...

667
00:47:08,170 --> 00:47:09,410
Please, please!

668
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:22,560
Oh my god.

669
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:25,280
Guys, there's no time to pick weapons.

670
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:27,060
Pick up weapons, guys.

671
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:28,500
It's like hell.

672
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:31,380
How do you pick up weapons when you're in hell?

673
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:34,260
They don't give you time!

674
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:35,100
Follow me.

675
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:38,600
They don't give you any time!

676
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:38,860
They don't give you any time!

677
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:45,100
I am a genius.

678
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:48,740
How much to turn it out to...

679
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:52,440
Guys, I'm not even staying alive in normal!

680
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:54,280
And you...

681
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:57,960
Guys, I can't even stay alive in hard mode.

682
00:47:57,960 --> 00:47:58,720
I...

683
00:47:58,720 --> 00:47:59,640
I...

684
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:01,880
Why...

685
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:05,280
Why do you think I'd be any better in Legendary?

686
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:10,720
Oh my god.

687
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:11,440
Oh!

688
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:13,140
My god!

689
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:15,000
Oh my god!

690
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:16,300
I'm so...

691
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:19,060
This is hard.

692
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:20,220
This is hard.

693
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,280
It must be an easier way.

694
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:24,260
There...

695
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:30,300
There must be...

696
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:32,980
There must be an easier way.

697
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:35,280
Okay.

698
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:36,320
Go slow.

699
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:40,500
Oh my god.

700
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:41,480
Oh my god!

701
00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:42,240
I got stuck!

702
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:43,840
I already fucked up.

703
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:45,120
I...

704
00:48:51,590 --> 00:48:52,950
Okay, we'll go slower.

705
00:48:53,210 --> 00:48:54,090
We'll go slower.

706
00:48:54,410 --> 00:48:56,010
Maybe slow is the way.

707
00:48:56,890 --> 00:48:57,450
Or...

708
00:48:57,450 --> 00:48:58,110
We'll go slower.

709
00:49:01,250 --> 00:49:02,430
Slow is the way.

710
00:49:03,730 --> 00:49:05,070
Oh my god!

711
00:49:05,330 --> 00:49:07,010
And then he spawns next to me!

712
00:49:11,610 --> 00:49:12,170
No.

713
00:49:13,130 --> 00:49:14,190
No, I'm not.

714
00:49:14,430 --> 00:49:14,850
Sir.

715
00:49:15,070 --> 00:49:17,310
Sir, I'm going through a lot right now.

716
00:49:17,930 --> 00:49:19,610
I'm going through a lot.

717
00:49:23,450 --> 00:49:24,010
Okay.

718
00:49:27,110 --> 00:49:27,750
Okay.

719
00:49:27,810 --> 00:49:28,390
Okay, it's five.

720
00:49:30,510 --> 00:49:32,050
Oh my god, it's five.

721
00:49:34,770 --> 00:49:35,970
It's so five.

722
00:49:37,110 --> 00:49:37,850
We'll go slow.

723
00:49:40,850 --> 00:49:41,490
Okay.

724
00:49:42,490 --> 00:49:44,290
Alright, we're going slow.

725
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:45,930
We're going slow.

726
00:49:46,310 --> 00:49:47,570
Slow and steady.

727
00:49:50,770 --> 00:49:52,110
Can I steal your gun?

728
00:49:54,010 --> 00:49:54,170
Whoa!

729
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:00,520
Whoa!

730
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:03,680
Oh my god!

731
00:50:19,890 --> 00:50:21,490
Okay, I'm ready.

732
00:50:21,790 --> 00:50:22,650
I'm ready.

733
00:50:22,950 --> 00:50:24,430
I'm ready.

734
00:50:24,950 --> 00:50:28,470
Guys, there's so much.

735
00:50:29,190 --> 00:50:30,710
There's so much.

736
00:50:32,550 --> 00:50:34,590
Okay, I'm ready now.

737
00:50:35,330 --> 00:50:36,310
We go slow.

738
00:50:38,510 --> 00:50:39,310
Okay.

739
00:50:40,190 --> 00:50:41,270
Slow and steady.

740
00:50:42,410 --> 00:50:43,830
Slow and steady.

741
00:50:44,410 --> 00:50:45,570
Get rid of the bombs.

742
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:50,080
Okay.

743
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:53,960
Alright.

744
00:50:54,340 --> 00:50:55,920
We got rid of the bomb one.

745
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:00,040
Alright.

746
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:00,720
It's five.

747
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:01,680
We're five.

748
00:51:02,140 --> 00:51:03,360
We're so healthy.

749
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:03,500
Let's see.

750
00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:07,800
And then, the bomb two.

751
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,440
Where's the bomb two?

752
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:13,560
Oh, I knew you were real.

753
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:16,820
Okay, the bomb two down.

754
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:24,420
Okay.

755
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:26,080
Bomb two down.

756
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:29,260
Oh my god, that's a shotgun.

757
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:31,200
Oh my god.

758
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:32,360
Alright.

759
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:32,920
Oh!

760
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:36,960
Okay, we got shotgun.

761
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:39,440
Alright.

762
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:43,840
We got one of the bombs.

763
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:47,660
Alright.

764
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:49,660
We are near the index chamber.

765
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:50,560
Follow me.

766
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:51,700
Oh my god, there he is.

767
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:53,340
I fucking knew you existed.

768
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:55,920
Oh my god.

769
00:51:56,060 --> 00:51:56,800
I heard you.

770
00:51:56,980 --> 00:51:58,020
I heard you.

771
00:51:58,560 --> 00:51:59,080
Oh!

772
00:52:04,750 --> 00:52:05,630
Okay, it's five.

773
00:52:05,810 --> 00:52:06,150
It's five.

774
00:52:06,270 --> 00:52:06,990
We're so healthy.

775
00:52:09,010 --> 00:52:10,290
Okay, we're so healthy.

776
00:52:10,890 --> 00:52:11,310
Okay, we're so healthy.

777
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:15,960
Okay, we just gotta get rid of these guys.

778
00:52:16,580 --> 00:52:16,980
Alright.

779
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:19,380
We're so healthy now.

780
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:21,720
Okay, we have... Oh, nice.

781
00:52:21,820 --> 00:52:22,340
We have ammo.

782
00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:23,460
We have ammo.

783
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:23,680
Oh!

784
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:24,520
Oh!

785
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:26,120
Oh!

786
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:26,140
Oh!

787
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:26,420
Oh my god!

788
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:30,880
The energy field of bombs can't use the index.

789
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:32,060
We must get...

790
00:52:32,060 --> 00:52:33,180
Are you fucking... No!

791
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:39,460
Oh my god, checkpoint!

792
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:40,940
Oh my god!

793
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:44,840
There's hope.

794
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:45,920
There's hope.

795
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:46,960
There's hope.

796
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:47,300
There...

797
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:47,640
Ah!

Ah!

824
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:03,000
Ah!

825
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:03,240
Ah!

826
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:03,240
Ah!

827
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:03,240

869
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:10,960
Ah!

870
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:10,980
Ah!

871
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:10,980
Ah!

872
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:10,980
Ah!

Ah!

881
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:11,300
Ah!

882
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:11,320
Ah!

Ah!

887
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:11,400
Ah!

888
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:11,400

00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:16,560
Ah There is hope in this world.

910
00:53:18,340 --> 00:53:21,540
There is hope in this world.

911
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:24,340
Oh my god.

912
00:53:25,420 --> 00:53:29,500
Oh my god.

913
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:32,860
I can't feel hope, guys.

914
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:35,080
It's possible!

915
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:40,080
Wait, what's that over there?

916
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:42,160
What is that?

917
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:45,380
Oh god, I really want to go through it.

918
00:53:45,580 --> 00:53:49,620
I really, I really want to go through that hole.

919
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:51,780
It's so tempting.

920
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:57,100
Oh my god, that's a shotgun though.

921
00:53:57,780 --> 00:53:58,460
I need that.

922
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:01,000
Okay.

923
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:03,180
Oh.

924
00:54:05,060 --> 00:54:05,900
It's okay.

925
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:06,940
It's okay.

926
00:54:08,860 --> 00:54:10,020
It's not okay.

927
00:54:12,860 --> 00:54:15,120
Jesus Christ, there's so many.

928
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:17,100
There's so many.

929
00:54:18,140 --> 00:54:20,320
Okay, we gotta grab this before they come back.

930
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:21,740
Come on.

931
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:22,860
Is there any extra guns?

932
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:23,900
No!

933
00:54:27,950 --> 00:54:29,110
Is there any extra?

934
00:54:29,350 --> 00:54:30,070
Any extra?

935
00:54:30,390 --> 00:54:30,730
Any?

936
00:54:30,910 --> 00:54:31,930
No extra bullets!

937
00:54:32,470 --> 00:54:33,930
Oh no.

938
00:54:34,910 --> 00:54:36,570
There's no extra bullets.

939
00:54:39,370 --> 00:54:40,010
Please!

940
00:54:45,270 --> 00:54:46,070
It's okay.

941
00:54:48,450 --> 00:54:49,390
It's okay.

942
00:54:49,590 --> 00:54:50,010
It's okay.

943
00:54:50,010 --> 00:54:50,350
We're fine.

944
00:54:50,630 --> 00:54:51,310
We're so fine.

945
00:54:53,770 --> 00:54:56,430
As long as the bombs don't get me.

946
00:54:56,630 --> 00:54:57,050
Ah!

947
00:54:58,710 --> 00:55:00,930
I can't see the guns!

948
00:55:01,050 --> 00:55:02,150
You don't understand!

949
00:55:02,950 --> 00:55:05,610
It's so hard to see the guns!

950
00:55:05,970 --> 00:55:07,630
It's so dark!

951
00:55:07,930 --> 00:55:09,530
You don't understand!

952
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:11,990
It's so dark!

953
00:55:11,990 --> 00:55:12,670
I can't appear!

954
00:55:13,130 --> 00:55:14,690
It's so dark!

955
00:55:16,330 --> 00:55:19,110
I can't see anything!

956
00:55:22,530 --> 00:55:25,010
The flashlight does nothing!

957
00:55:25,470 --> 00:55:27,330
It actually does nothing!

958
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:30,450
Oh my god!

959
00:55:30,630 --> 00:55:32,210
I can barely see anything!

960
00:55:32,410 --> 00:55:33,970
Even with the flashlights!

961
00:55:34,910 --> 00:55:36,230
Oh my god!

962
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:40,480
Oh god!

963
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:41,300
Not the bombs!

964
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:43,300
Not the bombs!

965
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:45,360
Get them out of here!

966
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:47,440
Get them out of here!

967
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:48,640
Okay.

968
00:55:49,060 --> 00:55:49,640
Okay, it's fine.

969
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:53,380
Okay.

970
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:55,040
Oh my god!

971
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:56,320
Of course it was next to me!

972
00:55:57,860 --> 00:55:58,920
Oh, I hear you!

973
00:55:59,140 --> 00:55:59,880
I hear you!

974
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:02,600
Come on, there has to be one more!

975
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:04,780
No!

976
00:56:05,180 --> 00:56:05,520
No!

977
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:07,580
You gotta be kidding me!

978
00:56:10,180 --> 00:56:10,980
Come on!

979
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:11,820
No!

980
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:12,220
Wait!

981
00:56:12,220 --> 00:56:12,220
Come on!

982
00:56:12,220 --> 00:56:12,500
Oh fucking yes!

983
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:14,840
I'll use this.

984
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:17,380
I'll use- Oh!

985
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:18,280
What's shutting me?

986
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:20,680
This is fine.

987
00:56:22,180 --> 00:56:23,280
This is so fine.

988
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:25,400
This is so fine.

989
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:28,740
We just gotta get rid of them.

990
00:56:30,980 --> 00:56:32,940
We just gotta get rid of them!

991
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:37,300
Oh, this is not fine.

992
00:56:37,620 --> 00:56:38,720
Oh my god.

993
00:56:43,060 --> 00:56:43,980
Oh my god.

994
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:47,700
Oh god, there's still so many.

995
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:49,500
There's still so many.

996
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:55,000
Please!

997
00:56:55,820 --> 00:56:57,060
Did you open it?

998
00:56:57,100 --> 00:56:57,820
Oh, he opened it.

999
00:56:58,040 --> 00:56:58,640
He opened it.

1000
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:00,040
I couldn't tell.

1001
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:01,900
I can't tell!

1002
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:04,820
Okay, we're okay.

1003
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:06,340
We're okay.

1004
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:09,840
Why are you laughing at my pain?

1005
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:15,700
Fuck you fucker!

1006
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:19,260
You fucker!

1007
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:25,100
Oh my god, this is so one bullet.

1008
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:29,360
Oh my god.

1009
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:31,560
Nine more doors.

1010
00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:35,380
One of you must have a shotgun!

1011
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:38,660
Please!

1012
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:42,300
Where is he?

1013
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:44,380
Where did he go?

1014
00:57:46,390 --> 00:57:47,380
Where did he go?

1015
00:57:49,820 --> 00:57:51,900
How am I supposed to know where to go?

1016
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:54,080
The flood must not escape the instruments.

1017
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:55,660
Where did he go?

1018
00:57:56,300 --> 00:57:56,840
AHHHHH!

1019
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:00,380
You fucker!

1020
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:01,840
Oh my god!

1021
00:58:02,180 --> 00:58:03,980
He's right behind me, isn't he?

1022
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:08,240
Oh my god, he's right behind me.

1023
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:08,860
I knew it.

1024
00:58:09,020 --> 00:58:10,000
I see you.

1025
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:12,480
I see you.

1026
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:16,000
I fucking see you.

1027
00:58:16,180 --> 00:58:16,460
I fucking see you over there.

1028
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:18,820
Oh my god.

1029
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:20,540
And no glass breaks.

1030
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:23,380
Break a fucking struggle.

1031
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:26,800
Holy shit!

1032
00:58:29,580 --> 00:58:31,640
A fucking course!

1033
00:58:32,980 --> 00:58:34,960
Can't get me, I have high ground.

1034
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:36,300
Oh shit!

1035
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:36,600
Oh shit!

1036
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:37,060
Maybe you can!

1037
00:58:39,860 --> 00:58:41,380
Oh my god!

1038
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:45,400
Oh!

1039
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:47,760
If only I have a shotgun!

1040
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:52,040
If only they carry shotguns!

1041
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:55,620
What happened to my shotgun floods?

1042
00:58:58,560 --> 00:58:59,600
What happened?

1043
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:03,540
Oh my god, that's...

1044
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:04,440
No, that's a pistol.

1045
00:59:04,660 --> 00:59:05,680
God damn it, that's a pistol!

1046
00:59:13,490 --> 00:59:14,010
AHHHHH!

1047
00:59:16,170 --> 00:59:16,690
NOOOOO!

1048
00:59:17,090 --> 00:59:18,770
I don't have ammo!

1049
00:59:20,010 --> 00:59:20,530
NOOOOO!

1050
00:59:20,810 --> 00:59:22,130
Please don't do this to me!

1051
00:59:24,990 --> 00:59:26,210
Oh, please don't do this.

1052
00:59:26,390 --> 00:59:27,350
Please don't do this.

1053
00:59:27,990 --> 00:59:28,510
Please!

1054
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:34,020
No!

1055
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:35,000
No, not you!

1056
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:35,780
Not you!

1057
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:36,680
Anything but you!

1058
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:38,080
Anything but you!

1059
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:42,140
Oh my god!

1060
00:59:42,940 --> 00:59:45,660
Nothing, please!

1061
00:59:46,140 --> 00:59:49,140
My suffering doesn't give you that much pleasure!

1062
00:59:54,130 --> 00:59:55,190
Guys, I would...

1063
00:59:55,190 --> 00:59:57,550
If I had a choice, I wouldn't be meleeing.

1064
00:59:58,750 --> 00:59:59,470
Guys!

1065
01:00:00,370 --> 01:00:03,210
Guys, I don't have a choice.

1066
01:00:03,750 --> 01:00:04,190
I...

1067
01:00:06,510 --> 01:00:07,790
Oh no!

1068
01:00:12,340 --> 01:00:13,100
Oh no!

1069
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:13,920
You must continue!

1070
01:00:15,540 --> 01:00:19,080
This game's relation to research facilities are most impressive!

1071
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:20,840
Perhaps what I'm telling you is...

1072
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:21,380
Oh no!

1073
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:22,460
I'm running out!

1074
01:00:22,580 --> 01:00:23,560
I'm running out!

1075
01:00:23,940 --> 01:00:25,940
I'm running out of hope!

1076
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:28,800
I'm running out of so much hope!

1077
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:31,040
Please!

1078
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:32,140
Please!

1079
01:00:32,620 --> 01:00:33,240
Please!

1080
01:00:33,740 --> 01:00:33,940
No!

1081
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:35,020
Yes!

1082
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:35,960
It does!

1083
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:37,480
Nice!

1084
01:00:37,940 --> 01:00:38,400
Thank you!

1085
01:00:38,620 --> 01:00:39,600
Where am I?

1086
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:41,340
Oh my god!

1087
01:00:41,540 --> 01:00:42,000
It's here!

1088
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:43,600
It's here!

1089
01:00:44,820 --> 01:00:45,460
It's here!

1090
01:00:45,460 --> 01:00:46,580
It's my worst nightmare!

1091
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:49,620
Oh my god!

1092
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:51,120
Where am...

1093
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:51,600
Oh my god!

1094
01:00:51,740 --> 01:00:52,480
I'm supposed to go straight!

1095
01:00:55,620 --> 01:00:56,420
Oh my god!

1096
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:57,120
I have ammo!

1097
01:00:58,120 --> 01:00:59,740
I actually have ammo!

1098
01:01:01,060 --> 01:01:04,800
Why do I have to reload?

1099
01:01:04,980 --> 01:01:05,980
Why do I have to reload?

1100
01:01:09,630 --> 01:01:10,170
Okay.

1101
01:01:10,950 --> 01:01:11,430
Okay.

1102
01:01:12,050 --> 01:01:13,050
Okay, it's okay.

1103
01:01:14,390 --> 01:01:15,190
It's okay.

1104
01:01:16,510 --> 01:01:17,070
Okay.

1105
01:01:17,070 --> 01:01:17,330
It's okay.

1106
01:01:17,590 --> 01:01:19,150
It's not okay, but it's okay.

1107
01:01:19,490 --> 01:01:21,310
It's not okay, but it's okay.

1108
01:01:26,150 --> 01:01:26,710
Okay.

1109
01:01:28,410 --> 01:01:29,130
It's fine.

1110
01:01:29,830 --> 01:01:31,550
Like, fuck that one guy in particular.

1111
01:01:33,430 --> 01:01:35,830
Oh, fuck me in particular, I guess.

1112
01:01:36,090 --> 01:01:36,750
I guess.

1113
01:01:45,290 --> 01:01:46,670
Alright, that's fine.

1114
01:01:47,510 --> 01:01:48,330
That's fine.

1115
01:01:48,330 --> 01:01:48,390
Okay.

1116
01:01:48,690 --> 01:01:49,670
I'm okay.

1117
01:01:52,730 --> 01:01:53,730
I'm okay.

1118
01:01:58,950 --> 01:02:02,090
I walked past multiple shotguns.

1119
01:02:02,270 --> 01:02:05,110
The prop doesn't show up on my feed.

1120
01:02:05,530 --> 01:02:07,290
So I can't tell.

1121
01:02:12,790 --> 01:02:14,290
We must continue.

1122
01:02:15,010 --> 01:02:15,590
This way, please.

1123
01:02:17,310 --> 01:02:18,250
Oh my god.

1124
01:02:18,630 --> 01:02:20,450
Oh my god, I'm just standing here.

1125
01:02:22,290 --> 01:02:23,610
Because I feel the most safe.

1126
01:02:24,410 --> 01:02:26,850
I feel the most safe when I'm back there.

1127
01:02:27,170 --> 01:02:28,430
When I'm on high ground.

1128
01:02:30,450 --> 01:02:31,390
Oh my god.

1129
01:02:31,570 --> 01:02:31,830
No!

1130
01:02:32,230 --> 01:02:32,450
Oh!

1131
01:02:33,230 --> 01:02:33,590
Yes!

1132
01:02:36,110 --> 01:02:36,670
Plan.

1133
01:02:38,370 --> 01:02:39,290
Definitely plan.

1134
01:02:43,420 --> 01:02:44,180
Oh my god.

1135
01:02:44,180 --> 01:02:45,280
I'm crying.

1136
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:47,340
I'm dying and he's just humming.

1137
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:52,540
Oh my god.

1138
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:54,240
Oh my god.

1139
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:55,240
There is a god.

1140
01:02:55,740 --> 01:02:56,240
There is...

1141
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:05,640
This installation's research facilities are most impressive.

1142
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:08,080
Perhaps you will have time to see them later.

1143
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:10,980
I'm crying and he's just laughing.

1144
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:13,080
He's just laughing.

1145
01:03:16,660 --> 01:03:17,780
Oh my...

1146
01:03:17,780 --> 01:03:18,060
Of course.

1147
01:03:18,220 --> 01:03:19,480
Of course they're behind me.

1148
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:20,900
They're behind me, aren't they?

1149
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:23,320
A fucking corsair behind me, aren't they?

1150
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:28,290
Oh my god.

1151
01:03:28,490 --> 01:03:29,630
Oh, I have overshield.

1152
01:03:29,990 --> 01:03:31,430
Oh, I have overshield.

1153
01:03:31,770 --> 01:03:32,310
Thank god.

1154
01:03:33,270 --> 01:03:35,310
I actually found overshield.

1155
01:03:37,270 --> 01:03:38,930
Thank fucking god.

1156
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:41,950
Okay.

1157
01:03:42,370 --> 01:03:43,130
I have to reload.

1158
01:03:47,690 --> 01:03:49,250
Alright, I'm moving up.

1159
01:03:49,650 --> 01:03:50,590
I'm moving up.

1160
01:03:52,590 --> 01:03:53,430
Oh my god.

1161
01:03:53,430 --> 01:03:53,830
Checkpoint.

1162
01:03:54,010 --> 01:03:54,790
Oh my god.

1163
01:03:54,990 --> 01:03:56,590
There's an actual checkpoint.

1164
01:03:58,570 --> 01:03:59,990
Oh my god.

1165
01:04:00,870 --> 01:04:03,730
I actually found a checkpoint, guys.

1166
01:04:06,690 --> 01:04:07,250
Okay.

1167
01:04:07,430 --> 01:04:09,310
I just want to make sure they pop first.

1168
01:04:09,910 --> 01:04:12,310
I need to make sure they pop before I go anywhere.

1169
01:04:13,210 --> 01:04:15,210
I got popped them like pimples.

1170
01:04:17,590 --> 01:04:19,030
I don't trust them.

1171
01:04:23,780 --> 01:04:24,780
Where is he?

1172
01:04:25,360 --> 01:04:26,160
Oh, where is he?

1173
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:27,420
I don't know.

1174
01:04:29,980 --> 01:04:31,140
Oh, thank you.

1175
01:04:31,660 --> 01:04:32,700
Oh, thank you.

1176
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:39,120
Thank you.

1177
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:41,080
Oh, thank you so much.

1178
01:04:41,380 --> 01:04:42,560
Oh my god.

1179
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:43,840
I actually have help.

1180
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:46,220
Thank you.

1181
01:04:50,770 --> 01:04:52,270
Oh, where am I?

1182
01:04:52,610 --> 01:04:53,850
Where am I?

1183
01:04:54,690 --> 01:04:55,450
Wait.

1184
01:04:55,450 --> 01:04:57,270
Why are they coming with me?

1185
01:04:58,090 --> 01:04:58,850
Please.

1186
01:04:59,310 --> 01:05:00,810
Come with me.

1187
01:05:01,270 --> 01:05:03,930
Come with me to this journey.

1188
01:05:07,810 --> 01:05:09,330
Episode 3.

1189
01:05:09,750 --> 01:05:10,870
Drama loop.

1190
01:05:11,570 --> 01:05:12,310
Choco.

1191
01:05:12,550 --> 01:05:14,110
Thank you for the super chat.

1192
01:05:14,290 --> 01:05:14,650
Thank you.

1193
01:05:14,910 --> 01:05:15,310
Thank you.

1194
01:05:15,590 --> 01:05:17,990
Why can't they be with me?

1195
01:05:21,230 --> 01:05:23,130
I don't understand.

1196
01:05:24,030 --> 01:05:26,010
I don't understand.

1197
01:05:30,740 --> 01:05:31,840
Holy shit.

1198
01:05:32,100 --> 01:05:33,760
Why do they take so long?

1199
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:35,600
Okay.

1200
01:05:38,300 --> 01:05:39,020
Okay.

1201
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:39,920
That was bullshit.

1202
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:41,820
These guys took so long.

1203
01:05:42,780 --> 01:05:46,180
Flood activity has caused a failure in a drone control subsystem.

1204
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:48,080
I must reset the backup unit.

1205
01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:49,380
Please continue on.

1206
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:50,040
Oh.

1207
01:05:50,660 --> 01:05:52,080
Oh, I thought I'd die.

1208
01:05:52,580 --> 01:05:53,300
I was...

1209
01:05:53,300 --> 01:05:55,580
I was gonna accept my fate.

1210
01:05:56,460 --> 01:05:58,620
I was gonna be like, okay, I'm dead.

1211
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:00,040
I actually...

1212
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:01,480
Oh my god, they're with me!

1213
01:06:01,780 --> 01:06:03,000
Oh my god, they're here!

1214
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:08,240
Guys, the flashlight is gonna do nothing for me.

1215
01:06:08,620 --> 01:06:10,700
It actually does not help me at all.

1216
01:06:11,940 --> 01:06:13,640
Oh my god, they're actually here.

1217
01:06:20,420 --> 01:06:22,320
Oh my god, I actually have help.

1218
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:23,860
That's crazy.

1219
01:06:31,670 --> 01:06:32,950
I thought I heard...

1220
01:06:34,710 --> 01:06:35,890
I thought they were...

1221
01:06:35,890 --> 01:06:37,230
No, don't you touch them!

1222
01:06:37,870 --> 01:06:39,110
Don't you touch them!

1223
01:06:41,230 --> 01:06:42,230
Oh my god.

1224
01:06:42,490 --> 01:06:44,210
Okay, but like, I'm a little scared now.

1225
01:06:45,710 --> 01:06:46,230
No!

1226
01:06:54,680 --> 01:06:55,620
No way!

1227
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:56,960
Are you serious?

1228
01:06:57,240 --> 01:06:58,120
Are you fucking...

1229
01:06:58,120 --> 01:06:59,020
Okay, okay.

1230
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:00,200
Okay.

1231
01:07:00,740 --> 01:07:03,800
I didn't realize they would do all that damage.

1232
01:07:05,220 --> 01:07:06,200
Oh my god.

1233
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:07,420
At least my sentence are here.

1234
01:07:07,740 --> 01:07:08,620
Thank god.

1235
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:11,920
Blood activity has caused a failure in a drone control subsystem.

1236
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:13,800
I must reset the backup unit.

1237
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,080
Please continue on.

1238
01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:15,300
Okay.

1239
01:07:15,460 --> 01:07:17,500
I will rejoin you when I've completed my task.

1240
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:22,720
Okay, it's fine.

1241
01:07:23,100 --> 01:07:24,680
We have the poppers.

1242
01:07:27,300 --> 01:07:28,400
Holy shit.

1243
01:07:28,520 --> 01:07:30,240
They do so much damage though.

1244
01:07:30,700 --> 01:07:31,380
I thought...

1245
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:32,400
I thought like...

1246
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:33,540
I was doing okay.

1247
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:37,080
But hold your position until...

1248
01:07:37,080 --> 01:07:39,080
Guess that's not happening.

1249
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:45,560
Whoops.

1250
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:46,180
That's...

1251
01:07:46,180 --> 01:07:46,920
That's an accident.

1252
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:53,480
Oh my god.

1253
01:07:53,620 --> 01:07:54,780
Okay, I got full focus this.

1254
01:07:55,140 --> 01:07:56,720
I actually have to full focus this, guys.

1255
01:08:02,140 --> 01:08:03,260
Oh my god.

1256
01:08:05,860 --> 01:08:06,260
Please.

1257
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:08,320
Okay.

1258
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:10,260
We still have lots of ammo left.

1259
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:13,600
Please.

1260
01:08:13,620 --> 01:08:14,560
I don't want to do this again.

1261
01:08:15,880 --> 01:08:16,220
Okay.

1262
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:17,580
We got one of the nades up.

1263
01:08:18,540 --> 01:08:19,120
Oh no.

1264
01:08:19,300 --> 01:08:19,780
Don't you dare.

1265
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:21,100
Don't you dare hit him.

1266
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:23,040
Get him away.

1267
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:26,500
Oh my god.

1268
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:28,620
How is there so much more?

1269
01:08:30,460 --> 01:08:31,580
How do you...

1270
01:08:31,580 --> 01:08:32,720
How do you still exist?

1271
01:08:34,440 --> 01:08:35,300
We did it.

1272
01:08:35,740 --> 01:08:36,400
We made it.

1273
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:39,240
Okay.

1274
01:08:39,660 --> 01:08:40,400
We made it.

1275
01:08:40,680 --> 01:08:41,220
Somehow.

1276
01:08:41,580 --> 01:08:43,140
We actually made it.

1277
01:08:46,100 --> 01:08:46,700
Okay.

1278
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:47,660
We're gonna...

1279
01:08:49,020 --> 01:08:49,620
Okay.

1280
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:50,780
We're gonna see if there's...

1281
01:08:50,780 --> 01:08:51,880
Oh, there's no extra guns.

1282
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:52,480
No!

1283
01:08:54,360 --> 01:08:55,500
I'm sorry.

1284
01:08:55,580 --> 01:08:57,160
I didn't know you were still fighting.

1285
01:08:57,760 --> 01:08:58,520
I...

1286
01:08:58,520 --> 01:09:00,600
I didn't know.

1287
01:09:01,180 --> 01:09:03,300
I couldn't save you.

1288
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:05,900
I'm sorry.

1289
01:09:06,820 --> 01:09:09,620
If I knew you were still fighting.

1290
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:12,440
Oh, and then there was one.

1291
01:09:14,980 --> 01:09:16,960
And then there was one.

1292
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:20,340
I didn't know you were still fighting, guys.

1293
01:09:20,700 --> 01:09:22,500
I thought it was over.

1294
01:09:24,580 --> 01:09:27,240
I was trying to find more guns!

1295
01:09:27,780 --> 01:09:31,700
The sentinels can use their weapons to manage the flood only for a short time.

1296
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:33,600
Speed is of the essence.

1297
01:09:34,320 --> 01:09:35,860
That's a fucking lie.

1298
01:09:36,140 --> 01:09:37,980
Okay, that's a lie!

1299
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:40,360
I found out we had to go slow!

1300
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:42,300
You're liars!

1301
01:09:45,580 --> 01:09:47,780
Speed was not the essence!

1302
01:09:58,420 --> 01:10:01,840
I tried with speed and it lied to me!

1303
01:10:12,180 --> 01:10:13,460
What kill?

1304
01:10:18,160 --> 01:10:18,940
What?

1305
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:22,500
Is that a rocket launcher?

1306
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:32,760
That's a rocket launcher.

1307
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:37,200
That's a... That's a goddamn rocket launcher.

1308
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:39,520
That's a...

1309
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:46,860
That's a fucking rocket launcher.

1310
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:57,380
They have rocket launchers now?!

1311
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:01,580
Oh my god!

1312
01:11:02,780 --> 01:11:03,900
What do you mean?

1313
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:06,540
I only have one rocket launcher!

1314
01:11:10,540 --> 01:11:12,080
Where are they going?

1315
01:11:13,860 --> 01:11:15,280
Oh my god!

1316
01:11:15,700 --> 01:11:17,040
Oh my god!

1317
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:18,760
Oh my god!

1318
01:11:20,660 --> 01:11:21,740
They're just babies.

1319
01:11:26,530 --> 01:11:27,530
Oh my god!

1320
01:11:27,670 --> 01:11:29,290
I hear so many things behind that door!

1321
01:11:32,860 --> 01:11:35,180
I hear them all behind that door!

1322
01:11:38,240 --> 01:11:38,880
Okay.

1323
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:40,640
Okay.

1324
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:41,660
It's just the babies for now.

1325
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:43,740
It's just the babies.

1326
01:11:48,870 --> 01:11:49,510
Okay.

1327
01:11:49,750 --> 01:11:50,750
It's just the babies.

1328
01:11:52,490 --> 01:11:53,130
Okay.

1329
01:11:53,410 --> 01:11:54,530
I'm not...

1330
01:11:54,530 --> 01:11:56,750
You're not getting my rocket launchers.

1331
01:11:59,970 --> 01:12:00,610
Okay.

1332
01:12:00,770 --> 01:12:02,370
Honestly, I'm gonna take the shotgun.

1333
01:12:02,630 --> 01:12:03,050
I...

1334
01:12:05,750 --> 01:12:07,210
Honestly, I can't...

1335
01:12:07,210 --> 01:12:08,590
I'm not risking it.

1336
01:12:08,770 --> 01:12:10,030
I can't...

1337
01:12:10,030 --> 01:12:11,130
I can't...

1338
01:12:11,130 --> 01:12:11,270
I can't...

1339
01:12:11,270 --> 01:12:12,010
I can't afford using...

1340
01:12:12,010 --> 01:12:16,730
I actually can't afford using anything but the shotgun right now.

1341
01:12:16,730 --> 01:12:18,190
Wait, what's over here?

1342
01:12:19,710 --> 01:12:20,790
I see you.

1343
01:12:25,770 --> 01:12:27,590
Am I supposed to go down here?

1344
01:12:27,850 --> 01:12:28,130
I...

1345
01:12:29,910 --> 01:12:30,950
I can't tell.

1346
01:12:36,890 --> 01:12:38,010
I can't tell!

1347
01:12:38,150 --> 01:12:39,350
There's so many paths!

1348
01:12:40,410 --> 01:12:42,670
Which way is the right path?

1349
01:12:43,170 --> 01:12:44,930
Okay, thank god I'm doing one level.

1350
01:12:45,070 --> 01:12:49,090
I think, like, if I did a chance of this, I would have been broken by...

1351
01:12:49,090 --> 01:12:50,490
Just by the end of this level.

1352
01:12:51,070 --> 01:12:52,530
I would not have been a person.

1353
01:12:53,070 --> 01:12:53,190
Alright.

1354
01:12:57,520 --> 01:12:58,000
Alright.

1355
01:13:02,350 --> 01:13:02,830
Yeah.

1356
01:13:04,250 --> 01:13:04,590
Bye.

1357
01:13:06,090 --> 01:13:06,990
Nice, we're okay.

1358
01:13:11,700 --> 01:13:12,660
Get out of here!

1359
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:14,240
Get out of here!

1360
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:20,740
I know, I knew it.

1361
01:13:20,860 --> 01:13:22,220
I knew you were on top.

1362
01:13:22,420 --> 01:13:23,680
I heard you scoing...

1363
01:13:25,940 --> 01:13:27,500
Oh my god, I'm turning into XPC.

1364
01:13:27,740 --> 01:13:28,180
I'm...

1365
01:13:33,340 --> 01:13:36,140
I'm chatteling my inner XPC right now.

1366
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:36,840
I am.

1367
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:46,420
Is there anything here?

1368
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:47,100
What the fuck?

1369
01:13:47,220 --> 01:13:49,120
Why did they told me to go into this corner?

1370
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:52,400
Oh, Sage, thank you for super chat.

1371
01:13:52,500 --> 01:13:53,240
Thank you, thank you.

1372
01:13:53,480 --> 01:13:58,120
Where is it for Doki to do the last of Halo after she's done the game?

1373
01:13:58,360 --> 01:13:59,120
What the...

1374
01:14:00,420 --> 01:14:01,360
I don't know.

1375
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:03,320
I don't know if I'm strong enough, guys.

1376
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:07,680
Okay.

1377
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:11,620
We'll make sure these guys die.

1378
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:15,280
What's hitting...

1379
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:16,300
Oh, I knew it!

1380
01:14:16,300 --> 01:14:18,380
I knew you were behind me!

1381
01:14:18,580 --> 01:14:19,680
I knew it was...

1382
01:14:19,680 --> 01:14:21,240
She's right behind me, isn't he?

1383
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:22,400
I knew it.

1384
01:14:22,680 --> 01:14:24,000
I fucking knew it.

1385
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:26,180
Oh, hey, nice.

1386
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:32,280
Okay.

1387
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:32,820
What?

1388
01:14:33,260 --> 01:14:34,280
What are you doing here?

1389
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:35,560
Get out of here!

1390
01:14:35,960 --> 01:14:37,320
Give me your shotgun, too.

1391
01:14:37,960 --> 01:14:38,340
Wait.

1392
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:39,200
Oh, shit!

1393
01:14:39,720 --> 01:14:40,120
Oh!

1394
01:14:41,740 --> 01:14:42,220
What?

1395
01:14:44,580 --> 01:14:45,240
Oh, no.

1396
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:45,560
Oh, no.

1397
01:14:45,640 --> 01:14:45,900
I'm one.

1398
01:14:46,060 --> 01:14:46,540
I'm one.

1399
01:14:46,660 --> 01:14:48,300
He's just gonna hit me and then I'm gonna be dead.

1400
01:14:50,160 --> 01:14:51,120
I need...

1401
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:51,500
I need shields.

1402
01:14:52,520 --> 01:14:54,240
How is there still...

1403
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:55,640
People trying to kill me!

1404
01:14:59,200 --> 01:14:59,920
Okay.

1405
01:15:00,780 --> 01:15:01,140
Okay.

1406
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:03,160
1 HP and a Dream right now.

1407
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:05,240
Oh.

1408
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:08,340
This is not the best time.

1409
01:15:08,660 --> 01:15:11,280
This is absolutely not the best time.

1410
01:15:15,750 --> 01:15:16,470
Okay.

1411
01:15:16,470 --> 01:15:16,470
Okay.

1412
01:15:19,940 --> 01:15:21,460
Just keep going forward.

1413
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:23,400
Just keep swimming.

1414
01:15:23,700 --> 01:15:27,380
Just keep sw... Oh my

1415
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:31,240
god, there he is.

1416
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:33,160
Oh my god, there I am!

1417
01:15:37,590 --> 01:15:38,030
Okay.

1418
01:15:39,090 --> 01:15:40,550
Just keep swimming.

1419
01:15:40,890 --> 01:15:41,790
Just keep swimming.

1420
01:15:42,410 --> 01:15:44,810
Oh, there's no help back here.

1421
01:15:45,110 --> 01:15:46,370
The installation was...

1422
01:15:48,090 --> 01:15:50,910
I just want one help back!

1423
01:15:51,250 --> 01:15:52,350
Just one!

1424
01:15:52,350 --> 01:15:52,390
One!

1425
01:15:55,190 --> 01:15:55,790
Please!

1426
01:15:56,650 --> 01:15:57,750
No, no.

1427
01:15:57,950 --> 01:15:59,410
I refuse to die by the little guys.

1428
01:15:59,630 --> 01:16:01,670
I refuse to die by these little guys.

1429
01:16:04,950 --> 01:16:05,550
Okay.

1430
01:16:05,550 --> 01:16:06,370
That's fine.

1431
01:16:08,070 --> 01:16:09,950
He's just laughing at me.

1432
01:16:15,240 --> 01:16:18,660
He's just laughing at me and my suffering.

1433
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:20,360
Is this how people feel?

1434
01:16:28,760 --> 01:16:30,600
Oh, I only have four bullets left!

1435
01:16:32,780 --> 01:16:33,820
Hey, yes!

1436
01:16:36,920 --> 01:16:38,660
I have to use this instead.

1437
01:16:39,140 --> 01:16:40,100
I only have four.

1438
01:16:44,620 --> 01:16:45,860
Oh, I don't have grenades.

1439
01:16:46,180 --> 01:16:46,280
Oh!

1440
01:16:47,620 --> 01:16:48,120
Elevator!

1441
01:16:48,440 --> 01:16:48,800
Elevator!

1442
01:16:49,020 --> 01:16:49,460
Elevator!

1443
01:16:49,620 --> 01:16:50,860
Take me to safety elevator!

1444
01:16:52,700 --> 01:16:53,560
Go up!

1445
01:16:53,720 --> 01:16:55,220
They can't get me when I'm up!

1446
01:16:58,420 --> 01:16:59,300
Okay.

1447
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:00,640
We're good.

1448
01:17:01,380 --> 01:17:03,600
But I don't wanna ride the elevator!

1449
01:17:03,820 --> 01:17:04,680
Me too!

1450
01:17:04,980 --> 01:17:06,720
I don't... Mom!

1451
01:17:07,160 --> 01:17:07,620
Dad!

1452
01:17:08,160 --> 01:17:09,520
Pick me up!

1453
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:13,480
Can someone pick me up, please?

1454
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:19,960
I wanna go home!

1455
01:17:23,380 --> 01:17:23,960
Oh!

1456
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:23,960
Sentinous!

1457
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:29,300
I would conjecture that the other species currently on the installation is responsible for releasing the flog.

1458
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:33,620
They seem most persistent in their attempts to access restricted areas.

1459
01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:35,820
That's a rocket launcher.

1460
01:17:35,880 --> 01:17:36,620
I can see it.

1461
01:17:36,860 --> 01:17:37,920
I see it.

1462
01:17:42,260 --> 01:17:42,840
Okay.

1463
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:44,980
I see it.

1464
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:46,820
I see a health pack!

1465
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:49,140
I also see a health pack!

1466
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:53,360
Can I go this way?

1467
01:17:57,330 --> 01:17:57,970
Okay.

1468
01:17:59,370 --> 01:18:00,330
Checkpoint done!

1469
01:18:00,570 --> 01:18:02,310
I need a final shotgun though!

1470
01:18:05,210 --> 01:18:06,090
Hey, guys!

1471
01:18:07,190 --> 01:18:08,830
Wait, I can't...

1472
01:18:18,720 --> 01:18:19,360
Okay.

1473
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:21,940
I thought it... I thought it'd go further.

1474
01:18:22,500 --> 01:18:25,000
I... I thought...

1475
01:18:27,220 --> 01:18:30,360
I thought it'd go further, guys!

1476
01:18:30,720 --> 01:18:32,140
I really did!

1477
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:33,220
I...

1478
01:18:35,200 --> 01:18:38,060
It looked like it'd go further!

1479
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:43,380
I even crouched and aimed at the ceiling!

1480
01:18:50,450 --> 01:18:51,130
It...

1481
01:18:52,510 --> 01:18:55,590
Wait, I like vaguely remember this level now.

1482
01:18:55,950 --> 01:18:56,390
I remember.

1483
01:18:57,210 --> 01:18:58,630
Cause like...

1484
01:18:58,630 --> 01:19:00,650
10 years ago...

1485
01:19:00,650 --> 01:19:02,470
One of my friends...

1486
01:19:02,470 --> 01:19:04,350
Was like, you gotta try Halo.

1487
01:19:04,730 --> 01:19:06,650
And then they took me to this level.

1488
01:19:06,650 --> 01:19:08,630
I've repressed this memory.

1489
01:19:08,850 --> 01:19:09,510
I...

1490
01:19:12,590 --> 01:19:13,090
I...

1491
01:19:14,190 --> 01:19:14,690
I...

1492
01:19:15,190 --> 01:19:16,510
I've repressed this...

1493
01:19:16,510 --> 01:19:19,050
I re... I remember now.

1494
01:19:19,870 --> 01:19:20,870
I remember now.

1495
01:19:20,870 --> 01:19:23,330
They started me at this level.

1496
01:19:23,530 --> 01:19:24,970
I remember now.

1497
01:19:25,190 --> 01:19:26,290
I actually remember.

1498
01:19:26,750 --> 01:19:28,630
I've actually...

1499
01:19:28,630 --> 01:19:30,390
I don't...

1500
01:19:30,390 --> 01:19:32,370
I remember this corridor.

1501
01:19:33,050 --> 01:19:33,450
I...

1502
01:19:33,450 --> 01:19:40,810
I was like, wait a minute.

1503
01:19:41,210 --> 01:19:42,710
I feel like...

1504
01:19:42,710 --> 01:19:45,290
I feel like a sense of deja vu.

1505
01:19:45,450 --> 01:19:46,630
And I was like, wait, no.

1506
01:19:47,310 --> 01:19:51,070
Now I remember why I'm feeling deja vu right now.

1507
01:19:51,070 --> 01:19:51,790
I...

1508
01:19:52,910 --> 01:19:55,850
I don't remember much from this level.

1509
01:19:56,650 --> 01:19:57,330
But like...

1510
01:19:58,150 --> 01:20:00,030
Bits and pieces of it...

1511
01:20:00,030 --> 01:20:00,930
Is like...

1512
01:20:00,930 --> 01:20:02,850
Bringing familiarity to me.

1513
01:20:03,050 --> 01:20:04,610
And now I know why.

1514
01:20:05,210 --> 01:20:06,870
Now I know why.

1515
01:20:08,350 --> 01:20:11,070
I've crossed these halls before.

1516
01:20:13,550 --> 01:20:15,410
Where am I supposed to go now?

1517
01:20:15,690 --> 01:20:16,950
I'm like, a little lost.

1518
01:20:17,390 --> 01:20:18,130
Oh, here.

1519
01:20:18,250 --> 01:20:19,170
He's unlocking the door.

1520
01:20:21,070 --> 01:20:21,470
Okay.

1521
01:20:21,850 --> 01:20:23,070
I was so confused.

1522
01:20:23,210 --> 01:20:24,250
Because they don't look like doors.

1523
01:20:25,090 --> 01:20:27,510
Sometimes they just don't look like doors.

1524
01:20:27,830 --> 01:20:28,050
Guys.

1525
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:41,060
Oh my god.

1526
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:44,880
Okay.

1527
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:48,080
Nice.

1528
01:20:51,260 --> 01:20:53,220
Okay, I just have to blow them up just in case.

1529
01:20:53,220 --> 01:20:54,480
What in the...

1530
01:20:55,220 --> 01:20:56,520
Protagonist unlocked.

1531
01:20:56,760 --> 01:20:57,920
Trauma memory.

1532
01:20:59,320 --> 01:21:01,420
I've played these games before.

1533
01:21:04,500 --> 01:21:05,140
It's...

1534
01:21:05,140 --> 01:21:06,960
I'm actually going through trauma right now.

1535
01:21:07,420 --> 01:21:07,940
I'm...

1536
01:21:10,900 --> 01:21:12,100
Oh my god.

1537
01:21:13,140 --> 01:21:14,480
Oh my god.

1538
01:21:14,640 --> 01:21:14,940
What?

1539
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:16,720
Oh, did I kill myself?

1540
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:17,500
I killed myself.

1541
01:21:17,980 --> 01:21:18,420
I killed...

1542
01:21:18,420 --> 01:21:20,600
I go through all the way here.

1543
01:21:20,600 --> 01:21:20,780
Oh.

1544
01:21:21,300 --> 01:21:21,500
Oh.

1545
01:21:25,340 --> 01:21:26,020
It's this way.

1546
01:21:31,660 --> 01:21:32,340
Okay.

1547
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:38,440
Okay.

1548
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:39,720
We gotta get rid of the...

1549
01:21:39,720 --> 01:21:40,660
The nades.

1550
01:21:43,780 --> 01:21:44,120
Okay.

1551
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:46,280
Oh.

1552
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:52,800
Okay, I wanna make sure I grab as much ammo as possible.

1553
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:56,040
Alright.

1554
01:21:56,240 --> 01:21:56,440
This way.

1555
01:21:57,860 --> 01:21:59,080
Oh my god.

1556
01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:02,020
I can't believe it brought me all the way back here.

1557
01:22:02,900 --> 01:22:03,800
No, I can't.

1558
01:22:03,900 --> 01:22:04,340
I can't.

1559
01:22:04,440 --> 01:22:05,180
This level sucks.

1560
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:06,000
I can.

1561
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:06,800
I...

1562
01:22:07,580 --> 01:22:07,840
I...

1563
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:08,800
100% yes.

1564
01:22:13,560 --> 01:22:14,880
Oh my god.

1565
01:22:19,080 --> 01:22:19,960
It's okay.

1566
01:22:20,360 --> 01:22:22,820
If I trap myself in this corner, I'll live.

1567
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:28,900
That's how it goes.

1568
01:22:29,300 --> 01:22:31,060
I'll live in this corner.

1569
01:22:36,830 --> 01:22:37,170
Okay.

1570
01:22:38,090 --> 01:22:39,050
We're fine.

1571
01:22:44,740 --> 01:22:45,860
Jesus Christ.

1572
01:22:46,140 --> 01:22:48,320
These things are so tanky too.

1573
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:49,260
That's the worst part.

1574
01:23:02,920 --> 01:23:03,820
Oh my god.

1575
01:23:03,960 --> 01:23:04,360
Thank god.

1576
01:23:05,260 --> 01:23:06,100
Here you go.

1577
01:23:07,260 --> 01:23:08,560
I'm not actually fine though.

1578
01:23:11,900 --> 01:23:13,220
Oh, I don't have...

1579
01:23:14,260 --> 01:23:17,280
Oh, I don't have any more shotguns though!

1580
01:23:22,700 --> 01:23:23,920
Are you serious?

1581
01:23:24,140 --> 01:23:24,740
Are you serious?

1582
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:29,540
Explode!

1583
01:23:35,540 --> 01:23:36,380
Oh my god.

1584
01:23:36,500 --> 01:23:37,400
I almost walked into it.

1585
01:23:40,380 --> 01:23:40,960
Okay.

1586
01:23:41,240 --> 01:23:42,220
We're not fine though.

1587
01:23:44,060 --> 01:23:44,620
Oh!

1588
01:23:45,960 --> 01:23:47,900
Why don't they just explode?

1589
01:23:58,600 --> 01:23:59,420
Please.

1590
01:23:59,900 --> 01:24:00,500
Please.

1591
01:24:00,620 --> 01:24:00,660
Please.

1592
01:24:00,660 --> 01:24:00,700
Please.

1593
01:24:00,700 --> 01:24:02,600
All I want you to do is explode.

1594
01:24:03,820 --> 01:24:05,100
That's all I want.

1595
01:24:08,180 --> 01:24:09,000
Oh.

1596
01:24:09,740 --> 01:24:11,900
I just need a shotgun.

1597
01:24:13,320 --> 01:24:15,370
Any shotguns anywhere?

1598
01:24:15,370 --> 01:24:15,810
Anywhere?

1599
01:24:17,210 --> 01:24:19,770
Where are all the shotguns?

1600
01:24:24,460 --> 01:24:25,260
Please!

1601
01:24:27,940 --> 01:24:29,600
Oh my god.

1602
01:24:30,360 --> 01:24:31,440
Oh my god.

1603
01:24:31,500 --> 01:24:32,420
He has the high ground too.

1604
01:24:37,400 --> 01:24:37,920
That's okay.

1605
01:24:37,980 --> 01:24:38,840
I can do a loop-de-loop.

1606
01:24:41,820 --> 01:24:43,100
I'll just do a loop-de-loop.

1607
01:24:46,860 --> 01:24:47,220
Please!

1608
01:24:47,460 --> 01:24:48,340
One of you must be...

1609
01:24:48,340 --> 01:24:49,940
Oh, none of you are carrying a shotgun.

1610
01:24:50,220 --> 01:24:51,880
There is a shotgun deficiency here.

1611
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:54,500
Get out of here.

1612
01:24:56,360 --> 01:24:56,780
All right.

1613
01:24:56,860 --> 01:24:57,300
They're all dead.

1614
01:24:57,720 --> 01:24:58,480
They're all dead.

1615
01:24:59,220 --> 01:25:01,260
I guess I don't need shotguns.

1616
01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:03,600
I'm looping.

1617
01:25:03,700 --> 01:25:04,320
I'm looping.

1618
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:04,940
I'm circling.

1619
01:25:05,060 --> 01:25:05,560
I'm kiting.

1620
01:25:06,440 --> 01:25:10,640
The installation was specifically built to study and contain the fun.

1621
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:13,700
Their survival as a race was dependent upon it.

1622
01:25:13,940 --> 01:25:17,520
I am grateful to see that some of them survived to reproduce.

1623
01:25:17,940 --> 01:25:18,180
Wait.

1624
01:25:18,360 --> 01:25:21,880
What are you grateful you fucking are?

1625
01:25:23,240 --> 01:25:23,860
Why?

1626
01:25:24,280 --> 01:25:25,220
They're killing me!

1627
01:25:28,600 --> 01:25:30,530
I'm so happy they're still alive.

1628
01:25:30,530 --> 01:25:34,810
Anyway, you might be dying right now, but not for the sake of humanity.

1629
01:25:37,870 --> 01:25:38,350
Bro!

1630
01:25:38,770 --> 01:25:40,530
None of them were spawning shotgunners!

1631
01:25:44,010 --> 01:25:45,410
He's not talking about the flood?

1632
01:25:45,650 --> 01:25:46,510
Oh, thank god.

1633
01:25:46,690 --> 01:25:46,830
Okay.

1634
01:25:46,910 --> 01:25:48,230
I was gonna be like, you asshole.

1635
01:25:59,340 --> 01:26:00,180
Oh my god!

1636
01:26:00,420 --> 01:26:01,480
That's the shotgunner!

1637
01:26:01,900 --> 01:26:02,680
Oh my god!

1638
01:26:02,720 --> 01:26:02,980
Please!

1639
01:26:03,220 --> 01:26:03,660
Don't!

1640
01:26:03,700 --> 01:26:04,700
Don't do this to me!

1641
01:26:04,920 --> 01:26:06,240
He's literally right there!

1642
01:26:07,200 --> 01:26:07,680
Please!

1643
01:26:07,680 --> 01:26:09,020
Don't do this to me!

1644
01:26:09,020 --> 01:26:10,220
He's right there!

1645
01:26:14,520 --> 01:26:15,300
Oh my god!

1646
01:26:15,540 --> 01:26:16,380
Oh my god!

1647
01:26:17,780 --> 01:26:18,960
Oh my god!

1648
01:26:19,500 --> 01:26:21,220
I actually got a shotgun!

1649
01:26:24,540 --> 01:26:26,000
Oh my god!

1650
01:26:27,220 --> 01:26:30,200
I lost most of my HP for this one gun!

1651
01:26:32,620 --> 01:26:33,940
It was not worth it.

1652
01:26:34,460 --> 01:26:35,820
It was not worth it.

1653
01:26:37,240 --> 01:26:39,280
It was not worth it, by the way.

1654
01:26:39,540 --> 01:26:41,660
It was absolutely not worth it.

1655
01:26:42,040 --> 01:26:43,300
I lost it all.

1656
01:26:43,300 --> 01:26:43,320
I lost it all.

1657
01:26:49,070 --> 01:26:50,550
Nah, I have 5 bullets again.

1658
01:26:56,880 --> 01:26:57,680
Oh my god!

1659
01:26:57,780 --> 01:26:58,120
I got in my claw!

1660
01:26:58,300 --> 01:26:58,740
Thank god!

1661
01:26:59,000 --> 01:26:59,700
Oh, thank god!

1662
01:26:59,820 --> 01:27:00,460
There's a health pack.

1663
01:27:03,220 --> 01:27:05,460
I will deactivate the security lock.

1664
01:27:05,820 --> 01:27:06,420
Wait here.

1665
01:27:07,040 --> 01:27:07,580
Oh, please.

1666
01:27:09,480 --> 01:27:10,400
Oh, please.

1667
01:27:10,620 --> 01:27:13,260
There's air vents and everything all around me.

1668
01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:15,580
Oh, my God.

1669
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:16,840
Oh, my God.

1670
01:27:18,840 --> 01:27:20,320
There's no vet behind me, though.

1671
01:27:20,700 --> 01:27:22,180
There's no vet behind me, at least.

1672
01:27:23,260 --> 01:27:33,140
There's no vet behind me.

1673
01:27:33,340 --> 01:27:34,360
Oh, no.

1674
01:27:35,560 --> 01:27:36,600
Oh, no.

1675
01:27:42,320 --> 01:27:44,220
Guys, they're flooding in.

1676
01:27:45,680 --> 01:27:47,300
They're actually flooding in.

1677
01:27:47,700 --> 01:27:48,480
Oh, my God.

1678
01:27:49,400 --> 01:27:50,920
Oh, my God.

1679
01:27:52,740 --> 01:27:53,720
Oh, my God.

1680
01:27:55,180 --> 01:27:55,340
Please.

1681
01:27:55,660 --> 01:27:56,840
Please, have mercy.

1682
01:27:57,160 --> 01:27:57,580
Please.

1683
01:27:58,820 --> 01:28:00,300
Have mercy on me.

1684
01:28:00,380 --> 01:28:00,680
Please.

1685
01:28:00,840 --> 01:28:02,560
I don't have enough HP for this.

1686
01:28:03,680 --> 01:28:04,600
Oh, my God.

1687
01:28:04,940 --> 01:28:05,280
No.

1688
01:28:10,740 --> 01:28:11,660
Oh, no.

1689
01:28:13,280 --> 01:28:14,240
Oh, no.

1690
01:28:14,800 --> 01:28:15,600
Oh, no.

1691
01:28:16,700 --> 01:28:18,140
Oh, please.

1692
01:28:19,320 --> 01:28:20,380
Oh, my God.

1693
01:28:20,740 --> 01:28:22,040
Oh, my God.

1694
01:28:25,380 --> 01:28:26,060
Please.

1695
01:28:26,640 --> 01:28:27,480
Oh, my God.

1696
01:28:27,480 --> 01:28:27,700
Please.

1697
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:29,660
Please have mercy on me.

1698
01:28:29,820 --> 01:28:31,000
I don't deserve this.

1699
01:28:31,260 --> 01:28:32,900
I've been a good boy.

1700
01:28:35,480 --> 01:28:37,400
I've been such a good boy.

1701
01:28:41,260 --> 01:28:42,160
Holy shit.

1702
01:28:43,940 --> 01:28:48,660
I think the worst part is that when I'm reloading, it takes 20 years.

1703
01:28:48,660 --> 01:28:51,080
It takes so long to reload.

1704
01:28:58,050 --> 01:28:58,510
Okay.

1705
01:29:01,010 --> 01:29:01,890
Come on.

1706
01:29:02,930 --> 01:29:06,510
Jesus Christ.

1707
01:29:06,950 --> 01:29:07,190
I'm ready.

1708
01:29:08,030 --> 01:29:10,130
I still don't get...

1709
01:29:10,130 --> 01:29:11,690
I have to reload.

1710
01:29:13,350 --> 01:29:15,130
Oh, my God.

1711
01:29:16,590 --> 01:29:17,510
Oh.

1712
01:29:18,230 --> 01:29:20,590
There's no shotgun ammo.

1713
01:29:31,780 --> 01:29:32,860
I'll do this.

1714
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:35,660
And just hope for the best.

1715
01:29:35,960 --> 01:29:37,820
And actually just hope for the best.

1716
01:29:38,160 --> 01:29:38,940
Right here.

1717
01:29:41,620 --> 01:29:43,680
Just hope for the best right now.

1718
01:29:43,880 --> 01:29:45,200
And I still don't grab...

1719
01:29:45,200 --> 01:29:46,420
I still don't grab any.

1720
01:29:53,900 --> 01:29:57,660
Guys, if I could grab another weapon, I would.

1721
01:29:57,840 --> 01:29:58,540
But none of the...

1722
01:29:58,540 --> 01:30:01,060
Everybody's dropping rifle right now.

1723
01:30:01,080 --> 01:30:01,900
Except for that one guy.

1724
01:30:02,380 --> 01:30:03,120
Except for him.

1725
01:30:04,140 --> 01:30:05,020
Oh, my God.

1726
01:30:05,240 --> 01:30:05,840
Thank God.

1727
01:30:06,140 --> 01:30:07,780
He's hand delivering me a shotgun.

1728
01:30:08,500 --> 01:30:09,240
Thank God.

1729
01:30:11,320 --> 01:30:12,240
Thank God.

1730
01:30:12,440 --> 01:30:15,140
He actually hand delivered me a shotgun for once.

1731
01:30:15,140 --> 01:30:16,820
Oh, my God.

1732
01:30:22,410 --> 01:30:23,810
Oh, my God.

1733
01:30:26,750 --> 01:30:27,190
Please.

1734
01:30:29,830 --> 01:30:30,570
Where is it?

1735
01:30:31,190 --> 01:30:31,870
Here it is.

1736
01:30:34,470 --> 01:30:35,330
Here it is.

1737
01:30:41,660 --> 01:30:42,680
I'm naining.

1738
01:30:43,500 --> 01:30:44,820
I'm naining.

1739
01:30:46,040 --> 01:30:47,920
I'm naining everything.

1740
01:30:49,480 --> 01:30:50,300
Here we go.

1741
01:30:56,400 --> 01:30:57,420
There's so nothing.

1742
01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:03,640
Oh, no.

1743
01:31:03,800 --> 01:31:04,140
Oh, no.

1744
01:31:04,380 --> 01:31:04,640
Please don't.

1745
01:31:04,760 --> 01:31:04,940
Get me.

1746
01:31:05,160 --> 01:31:05,500
Please don't.

1747
01:31:08,640 --> 01:31:09,160
Please.

1748
01:31:09,500 --> 01:31:10,100
Oh, my God.

1749
01:31:10,220 --> 01:31:10,520
The defense.

1750
01:31:10,740 --> 01:31:11,820
The defense team.

1751
01:31:12,020 --> 01:31:13,600
The defense team are here.

1752
01:31:17,720 --> 01:31:18,760
Thank God.

1753
01:31:23,530 --> 01:31:24,350
Oh, my God.

1754
01:31:24,570 --> 01:31:25,930
Oh, my God.

1755
01:31:26,230 --> 01:31:26,930
They're here.

1756
01:31:29,610 --> 01:31:30,450
Oh, my God.

1757
01:31:30,610 --> 01:31:31,110
And the shotgun.

1758
01:31:31,110 --> 01:31:32,570
A shotgun.

1759
01:31:32,690 --> 01:31:32,690
A shotgun.

1760
01:31:36,250 --> 01:31:37,950
The Calvary is here!

1761
01:31:38,270 --> 01:31:39,970
The Calvary is here!

1762
01:31:41,810 --> 01:31:45,750
Oh my god, the Calvary is no longer here.

1763
01:31:49,610 --> 01:31:52,510
The Calvary is no longer here.

1764
01:31:52,870 --> 01:31:54,570
Holy shit!

1765
01:31:57,490 --> 01:31:58,830
That was fast.

1766
01:31:59,030 --> 01:32:01,090
I did not expect the Calvary to die.

1767
01:32:01,110 --> 01:32:02,590
I did not die that fast, not gonna lie.

1768
01:32:07,400 --> 01:32:09,300
Okay, we still have some of them.

1769
01:32:19,580 --> 01:32:21,360
That was a bitch move.

1770
01:32:21,680 --> 01:32:24,540
We will call that a bitch move right there.

1771
01:32:29,260 --> 01:32:29,980
What's that?

1772
01:32:30,580 --> 01:32:32,060
Oh, there's another elevator.

1773
01:32:33,240 --> 01:32:34,640
Here's another one.

1774
01:32:35,160 --> 01:32:35,820
Ha ha ha!

1775
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:37,000
Ha ha ha!

1776
01:32:37,360 --> 01:32:37,560
Yay!

1777
01:32:38,520 --> 01:32:39,320
Ha ha ha!

1778
01:32:40,240 --> 01:32:41,880
Halo is met in genre.

1779
01:32:42,360 --> 01:32:45,600
Shooter zombie survival rage game.

1780
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:48,740
Prosecutor, thank you for the super chat.

1781
01:32:48,940 --> 01:32:49,920
Thank you, thank you.

1782
01:32:49,920 --> 01:32:50,100
Ew.

1783
01:32:53,630 --> 01:32:55,030
Ha ha ha!

1784
01:32:55,450 --> 01:32:56,330
Ha ha ha!

1785
01:32:57,430 --> 01:32:58,750
Ha ha ha!

1786
01:32:58,750 --> 01:32:59,130
Oh!

1787
01:33:00,810 --> 01:33:01,470
Oh!

1788
01:33:01,470 --> 01:33:01,510
Oh!

1789
01:33:01,510 --> 01:33:01,810
Look up!

1790
01:33:02,250 --> 01:33:02,550
Oh!

1791
01:33:02,730 --> 01:33:03,430
Oh my god!

1792
01:33:03,610 --> 01:33:04,590
This must be the last floor!

1793
01:33:04,910 --> 01:33:08,290
Oh my god!

1794
01:33:08,290 --> 01:33:08,410
Oh my god!

1795
01:33:12,300 --> 01:33:12,860
Okay.

1796
01:33:17,860 --> 01:33:18,420
Okay.

1797
01:33:18,420 --> 01:33:18,460
Bye.

1798
01:33:21,820 --> 01:33:23,280
Gotta blow these guys up.

1799
01:33:23,360 --> 01:33:24,040
Real quick.

1800
01:33:25,400 --> 01:33:26,660
I see you.

1801
01:33:27,220 --> 01:33:28,020
Think I don't?

1802
01:33:28,660 --> 01:33:29,760
That's fucking right.

1803
01:33:29,840 --> 01:33:30,460
I see you.

1804
01:33:30,640 --> 01:33:32,000
I fucking see you!

1805
01:33:32,140 --> 01:33:33,920
You can't creep up on me like this!

1806
01:33:34,660 --> 01:33:36,540
I've played these games before!

1807
01:33:42,850 --> 01:33:43,490
Okay.

1808
01:33:44,670 --> 01:33:45,110
That's fine.

1809
01:33:47,530 --> 01:33:49,570
I wanna make sure my guy lives.

1810
01:33:53,020 --> 01:33:53,660
Okay.

1811
01:33:54,600 --> 01:33:56,900
I wanna make sure he has to live.

1812
01:33:58,420 --> 01:33:59,420
My little buddy!

1813
01:33:59,880 --> 01:34:01,120
You'll live for me!

1814
01:34:01,860 --> 01:34:02,480
Ow!

1815
01:34:07,040 --> 01:34:07,940
Don't worry!

1816
01:34:09,820 --> 01:34:11,500
I'll make sure he lives!

1817
01:34:13,500 --> 01:34:14,160
Oh my god.

1818
01:34:14,260 --> 01:34:15,420
They're just coming back to life.

1819
01:34:15,540 --> 01:34:15,760
Okay.

1820
01:34:15,880 --> 01:34:16,880
That was a waste of ammo.

1821
01:34:17,300 --> 01:34:17,700
Nevermind.

1822
01:34:17,900 --> 01:34:20,680
I think you mu- Nevermind.

1823
01:34:22,780 --> 01:34:24,740
You wasted so much of my ammo.

1824
01:34:24,940 --> 01:34:26,420
I don't- You don't need to live anymore.

1825
01:34:33,160 --> 01:34:33,560
Nevermind.

1826
01:34:33,760 --> 01:34:34,920
That might have been a waste.

1827
01:34:41,130 --> 01:34:41,790
Oh shit!

1828
01:34:42,310 --> 01:34:42,970
You brought a shotgun!

1829
01:34:45,490 --> 01:34:45,890
Nice!

1830
01:34:46,330 --> 01:34:48,030
I actually needed that!

1831
01:34:48,190 --> 01:34:49,390
That was all the ammo I lost!

1832
01:34:54,080 --> 01:34:55,440
Oh, I hear them.

1833
01:34:56,840 --> 01:34:58,440
Oh, I hear them.

1834
01:35:02,920 --> 01:35:04,460
Oh, I hear them.

1835
01:35:04,980 --> 01:35:05,000
Oh, I hear them.

1836
01:35:06,330 --> 01:35:08,140
Oh, I definitely hear them!

1837
01:35:10,820 --> 01:35:11,440
Oh!

1838
01:35:15,180 --> 01:35:16,000
It's fine.

1839
01:35:16,340 --> 01:35:17,180
We're okay.

1840
01:35:17,900 --> 01:35:19,340
We have a shotgun.

1841
01:35:21,180 --> 01:35:21,860
Whoa!

1842
01:35:24,640 --> 01:35:25,500
That's okay.

1843
01:35:25,640 --> 01:35:26,760
We needed that shotgun too.

1844
01:35:29,420 --> 01:35:30,300
It's okay.

1845
01:35:30,300 --> 01:35:32,300
They're just loot delivering to me.

1846
01:35:33,420 --> 01:35:34,100
Right?

1847
01:35:34,820 --> 01:35:36,020
Just a little loot delivery.

1848
01:35:36,520 --> 01:35:36,860
Thank you.

1849
01:35:38,360 --> 01:35:39,120
Oh my god.

1850
01:35:39,340 --> 01:35:39,540
Thank you.

1851
01:35:40,180 --> 01:35:40,800
Thank god.

1852
01:35:42,620 --> 01:35:43,640
Please reload.

1853
01:35:44,060 --> 01:35:44,420
Please.

1854
01:35:44,420 --> 01:35:44,960
Please.

1855
01:35:47,580 --> 01:35:48,300
Okay.

1856
01:35:49,720 --> 01:35:51,020
We're so healthy.

1857
01:35:53,020 --> 01:35:55,420
We're so, in fact, very healthy.

1858
01:35:58,620 --> 01:35:59,340
Oh.

1859
01:36:00,460 --> 01:36:00,780
Oh.

1860
01:36:01,140 --> 01:36:02,200
Alright, we go this way.

1861
01:36:05,800 --> 01:36:08,940
The ammo is going down just like my sanity, guys.

1862
01:36:13,360 --> 01:36:16,360
As long as I blow up, one of them should be fine.

1863
01:36:21,380 --> 01:36:21,820
What?

1864
01:36:23,300 --> 01:36:24,000
Wait, what?

1865
01:36:24,200 --> 01:36:24,940
What do you mean?

1866
01:36:29,500 --> 01:36:31,780
Okay, I'll get rid of these guys first.

1867
01:36:32,740 --> 01:36:34,840
Oh god, there's way too many.

1868
01:36:37,520 --> 01:36:38,420
I'm in this corner!

1869
01:36:40,040 --> 01:36:41,400
This is a healthy corner!

1870
01:36:41,960 --> 01:36:43,940
Oh my god, this is still a healthy corner.

1871
01:36:44,340 --> 01:36:45,720
Oh my god!

1872
01:36:46,140 --> 01:36:48,040
Oh, why did I go in the corner?

1873
01:36:49,840 --> 01:36:51,640
Why did no one stop me?

1874
01:36:57,400 --> 01:36:57,840
Okay.

1875
01:37:00,480 --> 01:37:02,060
I don't know how to survive that.

1876
01:37:02,260 --> 01:37:03,500
I honestly don't know.

1877
01:37:03,620 --> 01:37:04,240
It was...

1878
01:37:04,240 --> 01:37:07,080
My depth was greatly exaggerated.

1879
01:37:09,880 --> 01:37:11,400
I have no idea.

1880
01:37:17,500 --> 01:37:19,000
What hit me?

1881
01:37:19,420 --> 01:37:19,900
What?

1882
01:37:22,600 --> 01:37:23,320
What?

1883
01:37:24,500 --> 01:37:26,100
What hit me?

1884
01:37:31,080 --> 01:37:31,960
What happened?

1885
01:37:32,880 --> 01:37:33,400
What happened?

1886
01:37:33,400 --> 01:37:34,260
Actually, what happened?

1887
01:37:37,300 --> 01:37:39,160
Bro, I don't even know what happened.

1888
01:37:39,360 --> 01:37:40,200
That's like the worst part.

1889
01:37:40,380 --> 01:37:41,660
I don't even know.

1890
01:37:41,660 --> 01:37:42,760
God!

1891
01:37:44,780 --> 01:37:45,440
God!

1892
01:37:49,500 --> 01:37:50,300
What?

1893
01:37:50,700 --> 01:37:51,920
I don't know!

1894
01:37:57,390 --> 01:37:59,430
Okay, I'm just going to like...

1895
01:37:59,430 --> 01:38:00,050
go backwards.

1896
01:38:04,950 --> 01:38:06,910
I don't know what's killing me.

1897
01:38:07,090 --> 01:38:08,850
I actually don't know.

1898
01:38:19,850 --> 01:38:21,850
Oh my god, I didn't mean to fall down.

1899
01:38:22,910 --> 01:38:24,370
I didn't mean to fall down.

1900
01:38:28,140 --> 01:38:28,620
Okay.

1901
01:38:32,370 --> 01:38:33,530
Okay, it's just these guys.

1902
01:38:34,050 --> 01:38:35,970
Oh hey, I didn't even see you over here.

1903
01:38:35,970 --> 01:38:37,290
That's fine.

1904
01:38:37,730 --> 01:38:38,970
I knew you had shotgun.

1905
01:38:40,790 --> 01:38:41,730
There's nades?

1906
01:38:42,250 --> 01:38:46,590
Wait, I can like nade the nades and then die from the...

1907
01:38:46,590 --> 01:38:50,030
Oh my god, I didn't know you can die from like just...

1908
01:38:50,510 --> 01:38:51,810
That's a thing?

1909
01:38:53,050 --> 01:38:54,870
That's so stupid.

1910
01:38:55,230 --> 01:38:59,130
If I don't pick up the nades, I can die from nades.

1911
01:38:59,390 --> 01:39:01,090
Oh my god.

1912
01:39:01,510 --> 01:39:04,090
I didn't know that was a thing.

1913
01:39:06,230 --> 01:39:07,650
That's so dumb.

1914
01:39:10,630 --> 01:39:11,930
Okay, now I know.

1915
01:39:12,310 --> 01:39:14,290
At least now I know guys.

1916
01:39:14,790 --> 01:39:16,450
At least now I know.

1917
01:39:21,140 --> 01:39:21,740
Okay.

1918
01:39:22,660 --> 01:39:24,280
I don't know where my guy went.

1919
01:39:24,680 --> 01:39:25,640
Where did he go?

1920
01:39:26,420 --> 01:39:27,960
Where did my friend go?

1921
01:39:30,400 --> 01:39:32,180
Wait, did I go the wrong way?

1922
01:39:38,100 --> 01:39:39,600
Oh the metal!

1923
01:39:45,200 --> 01:39:46,480
Is that not a pit?

1924
01:39:49,200 --> 01:39:50,320
Oh the bee!

1925
01:39:54,990 --> 01:39:56,130
Alright, let's do this again.

1926
01:39:56,410 --> 01:39:56,930
Let's...

1927
01:40:04,110 --> 01:40:05,390
Let's try this again.

1928
01:40:05,390 --> 01:40:06,990
Guys, let's just...

1929
01:40:10,950 --> 01:40:13,690
I don't know where the bridge is.

1930
01:40:17,970 --> 01:40:19,010
I thought...

1931
01:40:19,010 --> 01:40:21,690
I thought that was a bridge.

1932
01:40:25,250 --> 01:40:27,370
Just run straight.

1933
01:40:29,750 --> 01:40:30,310
Okay.

1934
01:40:30,490 --> 01:40:31,190
Okay, now I know.

1935
01:40:31,890 --> 01:40:33,270
Guys, now I know.

1936
01:40:34,570 --> 01:40:35,830
And now I know.

1937
01:40:36,070 --> 01:40:38,190
Guys, now I know.

1938
01:40:44,090 --> 01:40:45,490
And I think I'm dead.

1939
01:40:45,770 --> 01:40:46,890
I think I'm dead.

1940
01:40:47,430 --> 01:40:48,370
I think...

1941
01:40:49,150 --> 01:40:51,110
I don't have shotgun ammo.

1942
01:40:51,370 --> 01:40:53,130
I don't have shotgun ammo.

1943
01:40:53,850 --> 01:40:55,290
Wait, I think that's a shotgun.

1944
01:40:55,290 --> 01:40:55,370
Shotgun.

1945
01:40:55,630 --> 01:40:57,390
I think he is holding a shotgun.

1946
01:40:57,730 --> 01:40:58,890
Wait, I think you're right.

1947
01:41:03,620 --> 01:41:04,060
Okay.

1948
01:41:04,760 --> 01:41:05,520
I'll make sure.

1949
01:41:07,860 --> 01:41:08,300
Okay.

1950
01:41:09,960 --> 01:41:10,740
I'll go straight.

1951
01:41:12,520 --> 01:41:13,880
Oh my god, it's you again.

1952
01:41:14,140 --> 01:41:15,460
I just have to go straight.

1953
01:41:15,660 --> 01:41:16,700
I went the wrong way.

1954
01:41:16,860 --> 01:41:18,640
I knew I went the wrong way, too.

1955
01:41:18,860 --> 01:41:20,040
I fucking knew it.

1956
01:41:20,160 --> 01:41:21,840
I actually just went the wrong way.

1957
01:41:22,020 --> 01:41:23,020
Oh my god.

1958
01:41:23,240 --> 01:41:26,160
I went the way that I should never have...

1959
01:41:28,220 --> 01:41:29,780
The one way...

1960
01:41:31,380 --> 01:41:34,880
The one way I didn't have to go.

1961
01:41:35,080 --> 01:41:37,080
It was literally a 50-50.

1962
01:41:42,980 --> 01:41:44,420
Oh my god.

1963
01:41:47,200 --> 01:41:50,760
The other way I did it was the fucking other way.

1964
01:41:50,880 --> 01:41:53,500
I went up three times and then I went back down.

1965
01:41:53,720 --> 01:41:54,400
Like, how...

1966
01:41:54,400 --> 01:41:55,820
Now, retrieve the index.

1967
01:42:05,080 --> 01:42:06,100
I did it.

1968
01:42:06,680 --> 01:42:07,000
I...

1969
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:07,380
I...

1970
01:42:07,380 --> 01:42:08,580
I did it.

1971
01:42:12,340 --> 01:42:15,140
Protocol requires that I take possession of the index.

1972
01:42:15,220 --> 01:42:15,440
What?

1973
01:42:15,960 --> 01:42:17,080
But I did it.

1974
01:42:17,220 --> 01:42:18,780
It renders you vulnerable to infection.

1975
01:42:19,200 --> 01:42:19,520
I...

1976
01:42:19,520 --> 01:42:20,380
I did it.

1977
01:42:21,440 --> 01:42:24,380
Before we reach the control room and activate the installation.

1978
01:42:25,520 --> 01:42:25,940
What?

1979
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:26,860
The flood is spreading.

1980
01:42:27,080 --> 01:42:27,820
We must hurry.

1981
01:42:30,940 --> 01:42:32,720
Why did he take my...

1982
01:42:32,720 --> 01:42:33,840
Fancy stick?

1983
01:42:34,900 --> 01:42:35,340
I...

1984
01:42:35,340 --> 01:42:43,680
I did all the work.

1985
01:42:44,020 --> 01:42:47,660
Any organism with sufficient mass and cognitive capability is a potential factor.

1986
01:42:51,020 --> 01:42:51,740
Is...

1987
01:42:51,740 --> 01:42:52,400
Something wrong?

1988
01:42:53,620 --> 01:42:54,040
No.

1989
01:42:54,460 --> 01:42:55,180
Nothing.

1990
01:42:55,580 --> 01:42:56,220
Splendid.

1991
01:42:56,400 --> 01:42:56,800
Shall we?

1992
01:43:03,500 --> 01:43:05,420
No way I could get infected.

1993
01:43:05,840 --> 01:43:08,020
They made five more Halos after me.

1994
01:43:08,280 --> 01:43:08,880
Unfortunately...

1995
01:43:13,400 --> 01:43:15,020
My classification to...

1996
01:43:15,020 --> 01:43:19,100
Perform a task as important as the reunification of the index with the core.

1997
01:43:20,200 --> 01:43:21,880
That final step is reserved for you.

1998
01:43:21,960 --> 01:43:22,100
Yeah.

1999
01:43:22,320 --> 01:43:23,520
John Halo can't die.

2000
01:43:38,440 --> 01:43:39,840
That wasn't supposed to happen.

2001
01:43:40,020 --> 01:43:40,300
Huh?

2002
01:43:40,700 --> 01:43:41,840
Oh, really?

2003
01:43:43,320 --> 01:43:43,920
Ah.

2004
01:43:44,360 --> 01:43:44,960
Cortana.

2005
01:43:44,960 --> 01:43:52,060
I've spent the last 12 hours cooped up in here watching you toady about, helping that thing get set to slit our throats.

2006
01:43:52,260 --> 01:43:52,760
Hold on now.

2007
01:43:53,220 --> 01:43:54,220
Can you slit our...

2008
01:43:54,220 --> 01:43:54,500
Yeah.

2009
01:43:54,720 --> 01:43:55,680
He's friend-shaped.

2010
01:43:55,940 --> 01:43:56,520
I didn't realize.

2011
01:43:56,840 --> 01:43:58,320
He's your pal, is he?

2012
01:43:58,440 --> 01:43:58,840
Your chum?

2013
01:43:59,100 --> 01:44:02,600
Do you have any idea what that bastard almost made you do?

2014
01:44:02,860 --> 01:44:03,240
What?

2015
01:44:03,540 --> 01:44:03,780
Yes.

2016
01:44:04,580 --> 01:44:07,180
Activate Halo's defenses and destroy the flood.

2017
01:44:07,660 --> 01:44:08,340
Which is why...

2018
01:44:08,340 --> 01:44:10,120
Why is my wife mad at me?

2019
01:44:10,580 --> 01:44:11,500
You mean this?

2020
01:44:12,240 --> 01:44:14,180
A construct in the car?

2021
01:44:14,180 --> 01:44:16,560
That is absolutely unacceptable.

2022
01:44:16,960 --> 01:44:18,240
Sod off.

2023
01:44:18,440 --> 01:44:19,540
What impregnance.

2024
01:44:19,720 --> 01:44:21,240
I shall purge you at once.

2025
01:44:21,660 --> 01:44:22,760
You sure that's a good idea?

2026
01:44:23,940 --> 01:44:24,460
How?

2027
01:44:24,560 --> 01:44:25,360
How?

2028
01:44:25,460 --> 01:44:26,460
How dare you?

2029
01:44:26,980 --> 01:44:27,140
Oh!

2030
01:44:27,660 --> 01:44:28,140
Do what?

2031
01:44:28,360 --> 01:44:29,700
I have the index.

2032
01:44:30,140 --> 01:44:32,180
You can just float and sputter.

2033
01:44:32,840 --> 01:44:33,080
Enough.

2034
01:44:34,120 --> 01:44:35,720
Stop fighting!

2035
01:44:36,620 --> 01:44:37,220
Stop!

2036
01:44:37,940 --> 01:44:41,180
I'm sorry, I was thinking of smiling friends when I saw that.

2037
01:44:41,420 --> 01:44:44,320
You have no idea how this ring works, do you?

2038
01:44:44,540 --> 01:44:45,960
Why the Forerunners built it?

2039
01:44:46,360 --> 01:44:48,180
Halo doesn't kill flood.

2040
01:44:48,680 --> 01:44:49,900
It kills their food.

2041
01:44:50,120 --> 01:44:50,640
Wait, that's us.

2042
01:44:50,640 --> 01:44:51,440
So it kills me.

2043
01:44:51,840 --> 01:44:52,240
Units, covenant, whatever.

2044
01:44:52,620 --> 01:44:54,880
We are all equally edible.

2045
01:44:55,200 --> 01:44:58,380
The only way to stop the flood is to starve them to death.

2046
01:44:58,660 --> 01:45:02,000
And that's exactly what Halo is designed to do.

2047
01:45:02,140 --> 01:45:05,160
Wipe the galaxy clean of all sentient lives.

2048
01:45:05,160 --> 01:45:06,240
That's Halo?

2049
01:45:09,220 --> 01:45:13,400
Wait, why the fuck do we let this happen, like, six more times?

2050
01:45:14,260 --> 01:45:14,820
Why?

2051
01:45:15,400 --> 01:45:15,960
What?

2052
01:45:16,340 --> 01:45:17,580
That's what Halo means?

2053
01:45:18,740 --> 01:45:22,900
Why the fuck do we still let it happen, try to happen five to six more times?

2054
01:45:23,940 --> 01:45:26,020
This galaxy will be quite devoid of life.

2055
01:45:26,300 --> 01:45:29,680
Or at least any life with sufficient biomass to sustain the flood.

2056
01:45:30,740 --> 01:45:32,080
But you already knew that.

2057
01:45:32,860 --> 01:45:34,860
I mean, how couldn't you?

2058
01:45:35,160 --> 01:45:36,960
Left out that little detail, did he?

2059
01:45:37,140 --> 01:45:39,720
We have filed outbreak containment procedure to the letter.

2060
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,940
You were with me each step of the way as we managed this crisis.

2061
01:45:43,460 --> 01:45:45,040
Chief, I'm picking up movement.

2062
01:45:45,240 --> 01:45:46,100
Why would you hesitate to...

2063
01:45:46,100 --> 01:45:47,260
People never learn.

2064
01:45:47,860 --> 01:45:50,000
We need to go right now.

2065
01:45:50,440 --> 01:45:54,240
Last time you asked me, if it were my choice, would I do it?

2066
01:45:55,300 --> 01:45:59,640
Having had considerable time to ponder your query, My answer has not changed.

2067
01:46:00,140 --> 01:46:01,180
There is no choice.

2068
01:46:01,580 --> 01:46:03,040
We must activate the ring.

2069
01:46:04,300 --> 01:46:06,600
Get us out of here.

2070
01:46:06,880 --> 01:46:09,180
But why would a covenant want to kill every...

2071
01:46:09,180 --> 01:46:10,000
Like, all...

2072
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:11,320
Like, their entire kind, too?

2073
01:46:11,560 --> 01:46:12,260
I suppose there be an action.

2074
01:46:12,840 --> 01:46:16,220
Give your construct to me, or I will be forced to take her from you.

2075
01:46:17,060 --> 01:46:19,100
That's not going to happen.

2076
01:46:19,380 --> 01:46:20,020
Soviet.

2077
01:46:20,960 --> 01:46:21,760
Save his head.

2078
01:46:22,560 --> 01:46:23,360
Dispose of the rest.

2079
01:46:24,640 --> 01:46:25,000
Huh?

2080
01:46:25,540 --> 01:46:25,940
No!

2081
01:46:26,640 --> 01:46:27,560
But we're friends!

2082
01:46:27,920 --> 01:46:28,320
No!

2083
01:46:29,980 --> 01:46:30,960
Oh my god.

2084
01:46:31,260 --> 01:46:31,580
Please.

2085
01:46:33,060 --> 01:46:33,960
Oh my god.

2086
01:46:34,020 --> 01:46:35,420
When did I get this gun?

2087
01:46:40,960 --> 01:46:42,080
Oh my god.

2088
01:46:42,220 --> 01:46:43,660
Oh, that's what betrayal is.

2089
01:46:48,280 --> 01:46:49,660
The gun pointed.

2090
01:46:49,900 --> 01:46:51,120
We can't let the monitor activate Halo.

2091
01:46:51,120 --> 01:46:52,180
We have to stop him.

2092
01:46:52,220 --> 01:46:52,780
Alright, guys.

2093
01:46:53,160 --> 01:46:53,660
We have to destroy Halo.

2094
01:46:54,560 --> 01:46:59,540
According to my analysis of the available data, I believe the best course of action is somewhat risky.

2095
01:46:59,940 --> 01:47:00,620
Alright, guys.

2096
01:47:00,940 --> 01:47:06,040
An explosion of sufficient size will help destabilize the ring, and will cut through a number of primary systems.

2097
01:47:06,600 --> 01:47:09,600
We need to trigger a detonation on a large scale, however.

2098
01:47:10,420 --> 01:47:13,980
A starship's fusion reactors going critical would do the job.

2099
01:47:16,040 --> 01:47:17,880
Wait, are we in a new chapter now?

2100
01:47:18,120 --> 01:47:21,000
...and see if I can locate the Pillar of Autumn's crash site.

2101
01:47:21,120 --> 01:47:26,980
If the ship's fusion reactors are still relatively intact, we can use them to destroy Halo.

2102
01:47:27,920 --> 01:47:28,440
Okay.

2103
01:47:28,820 --> 01:47:29,780
Did I do a checkpoint?

2104
01:47:30,960 --> 01:47:32,600
Am I at a checkpoint or no?

2105
01:47:32,860 --> 01:47:35,100
Because I don't want to do that fucking fight again.

2106
01:47:35,340 --> 01:47:35,620
I...

2107
01:47:38,820 --> 01:47:39,860
Was that...

2108
01:47:39,860 --> 01:47:41,160
Was that...

2109
01:47:41,160 --> 01:47:43,180
Did I do a checkpoint when I killed those guys?

2110
01:47:43,560 --> 01:47:44,420
Yes, it's saved.

2111
01:47:44,620 --> 01:47:45,720
Alright, we're calling it here.

2112
01:47:45,720 --> 01:47:46,480
We're gonna...

2113
01:47:46,480 --> 01:47:47,960
I need to know...

2114
01:47:47,960 --> 01:47:53,200
I need to know when I killed all those sentinels, I need to know if there was a checkpoint.

2115
01:47:53,580 --> 01:47:54,360
Because I...

2116
01:47:55,960 --> 01:47:56,840
I don't...

2117
01:47:56,840 --> 01:47:59,400
I don't want to kill those sentinels again.

2118
01:48:00,400 --> 01:48:00,840
Uh...

2119
01:48:02,640 --> 01:48:03,080
Alright.

2120
01:48:03,580 --> 01:48:04,440
Wait, not yet?

2121
01:48:05,220 --> 01:48:05,660
Not...

2122
01:48:05,660 --> 01:48:06,180
Okay, we're...

2123
01:48:06,180 --> 01:48:07,020
Okay, wait, let me...

2124
01:48:07,020 --> 01:48:07,600
I'll make sure.

2125
01:48:07,700 --> 01:48:08,620
I need to make sure, guys.

2126
01:48:08,960 --> 01:48:09,660
Guys, okay.

2127
01:48:09,660 --> 01:48:10,860
I need to make sure...

2128
01:48:10,860 --> 01:48:13,120
I need to make sure that...

2129
01:48:13,120 --> 01:48:13,620
Alright.

2130
01:48:13,760 --> 01:48:15,080
Oh my god, you fuckers.

2131
01:48:15,280 --> 01:48:17,180
You fuckers actually almost...

2132
01:48:17,180 --> 01:48:17,420
Okay.

2133
01:48:17,900 --> 01:48:18,380
Now.

2134
01:48:19,020 --> 01:48:19,540
Now.

2135
01:48:21,800 --> 01:48:25,040
You guys almost made me do that again.

2136
01:48:25,360 --> 01:48:25,820
Okay.

2137
01:48:26,200 --> 01:48:26,920
Anyway, guys.

2138
01:48:27,180 --> 01:48:29,660
Like I said, we're just gonna do one...

2139
01:48:31,580 --> 01:48:32,100
One...

2140
01:48:32,100 --> 01:48:32,860
Um...

2141
01:48:32,860 --> 01:48:34,640
We were only gonna do one level.

2142
01:48:34,980 --> 01:48:36,900
After that, I think I went...

2143
01:48:36,900 --> 01:48:39,220
I went through a lot of trauma doing it.

2144
01:48:39,220 --> 01:48:39,640
Uh...

2145
01:48:39,640 --> 01:48:42,100
Doing the fucking library level.

2146
01:48:42,320 --> 01:48:43,640
And like I said, um...

2147
01:48:43,640 --> 01:48:44,820
It's a very long day for me tomorrow.

2148
01:48:45,640 --> 01:48:46,020
Um...

2149
01:48:46,020 --> 01:48:46,960
The two betrayals.

2150
01:48:47,080 --> 01:48:47,520
This was...

2151
01:48:47,520 --> 01:48:49,540
The first betrayal was from that...

2152
01:48:49,540 --> 01:48:50,560
The fucking orb.

2153
01:48:50,800 --> 01:48:52,580
The second betrayal was from the chat.

2154
01:48:52,800 --> 01:48:53,820
Like, that was where...

2155
01:48:55,140 --> 01:48:57,700
That's where the two betrayals came from.

2156
01:48:58,100 --> 01:48:58,720
Anyway, guys.

2157
01:48:59,920 --> 01:49:00,400
Um...

2158
01:49:00,400 --> 01:49:01,440
Like I said...

2159
01:49:01,440 --> 01:49:02,160
Um...

2160
01:49:02,160 --> 01:49:04,140
I was gonna do a short stream today.

2161
01:49:04,360 --> 01:49:06,900
I know it's like a lot shorter than my usual Halo streams.

2162
01:49:07,320 --> 01:49:07,800
Um...

2163
01:49:07,800 --> 01:49:09,200
But tomorrow and the day after tomorrow...

2164
01:49:09,200 --> 01:49:10,480
Are gonna be really busy for me.

2165
01:49:10,960 --> 01:49:11,180
Um...

2166
01:49:11,180 --> 01:49:12,000
And like tonight...

2167
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,760
I actually have a lot of stuff to do in preparation for my concert tomorrow.

2168
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:16,800
As well as my other two special...

2169
01:49:16,800 --> 01:49:17,540
Two streams...

2170
01:49:17,540 --> 01:49:17,740
Uh...

2171
01:49:17,740 --> 01:49:18,340
Tomorrow as well.

2172
01:49:19,240 --> 01:49:19,620
So...

2173
01:49:20,140 --> 01:49:20,520
Um...

2174
01:49:20,520 --> 01:49:22,700
I am going to call it here.

2175
01:49:22,980 --> 01:49:23,340
Uh...

2176
01:49:23,340 --> 01:49:24,440
Thank you everybody for watching.

2177
01:49:24,620 --> 01:49:25,960
I'm sorry I didn't know I started a stream late.

2178
01:49:26,220 --> 01:49:26,520
Uh...

2179
01:49:26,520 --> 01:49:28,840
But I still hope you guys had a great time watching.

2180
01:49:29,560 --> 01:49:29,920
Uh...

2181
01:49:29,920 --> 01:49:30,240
Boom.

2182
01:49:30,340 --> 01:49:31,040
Thank you for the super chat.

2183
01:49:31,140 --> 01:49:31,340
Thank you.

2184
01:49:31,420 --> 01:49:31,700
Thank you.

2185
01:49:31,780 --> 01:49:33,300
Did you enjoy the trauma?

2186
01:49:33,540 --> 01:49:35,240
I enjoyed it so much.

2187
01:49:35,400 --> 01:49:40,640
I actually unlocked a repressed memory from 10 years ago.

2188
01:49:40,640 --> 01:49:41,460
Like I...

2189
01:49:41,460 --> 01:49:44,120
You guys had actually...

2190
01:49:44,120 --> 01:49:45,460
I was like...

2191
01:49:45,460 --> 01:49:46,600
I never played Halo before.

2192
01:49:46,820 --> 01:49:48,200
But I forgot I did.

2193
01:49:48,560 --> 01:49:49,680
It was this level.

2194
01:49:49,860 --> 01:49:52,920
This one level that my friend made me try.

2195
01:49:55,060 --> 01:49:55,700
Like...

2196
01:49:56,900 --> 01:49:58,100
I repressed.

2197
01:49:59,320 --> 01:49:59,920
Um...

2198
01:49:59,920 --> 01:50:00,920
Anyway...

2199
01:50:00,920 --> 01:50:01,280
Um...

2200
01:50:01,280 --> 01:50:03,180
As always everybody...

2201
01:50:03,180 --> 01:50:04,380
Stay hydrated.

2202
01:50:05,080 --> 01:50:05,920
Poster checked.

2203
01:50:06,340 --> 01:50:07,600
Get up and move around.

2204
01:50:07,720 --> 01:50:08,720
To get that blood flowing.

2205
01:50:09,100 --> 01:50:09,940
And if you...

2206
01:50:09,940 --> 01:50:10,780
Except for me...

2207
01:50:10,780 --> 01:50:11,540
Head to bed.

2208
01:50:11,700 --> 01:50:12,120
Cause...

2209
01:50:12,120 --> 01:50:12,900
You deserve it.

2210
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:14,380
I'll see you guys next time everybody.

2211
01:50:15,100 --> 01:50:15,780
Bye guys.

2212
01:50:16,120 --> 01:50:16,700
Bye.

2213
01:50:16,700 --> 01:50:16,940
Bye.
