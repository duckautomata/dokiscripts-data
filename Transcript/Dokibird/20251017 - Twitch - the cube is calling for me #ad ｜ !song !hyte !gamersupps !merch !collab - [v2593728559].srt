00:03:40,570 --> 00:05:08,150

2
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:29,530
So, a huge thank you to Excel Games, to Tihi, for letting me do the sponsor today, and also for sponsoring me in general.

3
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:33,290
So, yeah, I'm really looking forward to trying, yeah, Tihi.

4
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:34,870
Okay, do it fair.

5
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:41,870
I did say I booked the tickets a super last minute to New York.

6
00:05:43,310 --> 00:06:09,610
um for uh for comic-con and uh and at that time it was like hell week so I wasn't really looking at my calendar I usually do I usually do but like during that it was different it was a different time there was a different dokie during that time like I wasn't a real person I'll tell you more about that story um later on on the next stream on YouTube but but it's a lot a lot of stuff was

7
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:17,550
But yeah, so here's a shout out to XO Games for today's sponsor.

8
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:22,250
It's apparently an extraction action game.

9
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:26,110
So it's not really natural.

10
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:29,730
It's not like an extraction shooter, but extraction action game.

11
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:33,250
So melee is like the core of the combat.

12
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:37,490
And there's apparently a lot of different skills you can choose from.

13
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:38,850
So I was like looking through it.

14
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:41,250
And there's like apparently a bunch of skills you can choose.

15
00:06:42,230 --> 00:07:08,310
and uh and it's about like it's in this post-apocalyptic world so we're gonna see uh we're gonna see how this goes uh i haven't played an extraction action before i played a lot of extraction shooters but not an extraction action so this is gonna be interesting because like action is apparently like um the folk core focus of the combat um and apparently like incredibly fast too So,

16
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:12,290
and there is a built-in voice control.

17
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:15,030
So, we'll see how this goes.

18
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:18,290
But, as you can check out the game.

19
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:19,790

Just so you guys know, it'll just be an hour.

00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:44,270
Also, I did take a nap before this stream.

91
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:48,650
Because I always think, like, my body will be different.

92
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:55,990
Today will be the day my body will be okay during nap time.

93

00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,800
Wait, I don't want to buy that.

144
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,900
Wait, oh, is it here?

145
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,200
No, I think that's the...

146
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:47,760
I think he's too cloved up to be the clothing guy.

147
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:51,080
I think it was like, who sells that?

148
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,760
Oh, crafting shop?

149
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,080
Uh...

150
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:55,540
Drum.

151
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,720
What the fuck do I do at the drum section?

152
00:22:58,900 --> 00:22:59,780
Do I play it?

153
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:00,160
Oh.

154
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:03,400
Oh, it's the throwaway stuff.

155
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,480
It's your trash can.

156
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,140
How do I get that?

157
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:40,460
okay all right all right sound team said we gotta bring it to max volume and then we'll turn the overall up volume all right that should be good it says matching in progress i wonder if that means oh my god oh my god we're getting these goods i wonder that means if i'm queuing up at the Is it him?

158
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:41,640
Does he sell that?

159
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,100
No, he doesn't.

160
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,860
Where did he get that?

161
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:50,720
I guess if I kill one of the girls, like in game, I could get it, I guess.

162
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,180
So like, if she dies, I can take her clothes.

163
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,520
I will be...

164
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,480
Oh my god!

165
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:02,700
Okay, I don't think she's gonna die anytime soon.

166
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:05,800
It looks like she's gaming right now.

167
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:10,400
She has like all the gaming shit.

168
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:12,100
The combo.

169
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,340
Yeah, she has the...

170
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:15,860
I know I'm not open mic right now.

171
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,320
So like I'm fine.

172
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,540
Is this matching in progress?

173
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,280
I assume...

174
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:24,300
I assume I'm getting into a game.

175
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,180
I hope.

176
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:26,920
It'd be awkward.

177
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:28,960
If I'm that.

178
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:30,520
Alright.

179
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:32,460
We must stay focused.

180
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,440
Do not let the women distract us.

181
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:41,940
Okay, what does he have?

182
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,800
It would be funny if he had the bikini.

183
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:45,900
Okay, no, he doesn't.

184
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:53,740
Okay, I'll be like, sir, sir, we gotta lock you up and you're selling the bikinis.

185
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:59,560
It's called The Cube Saves Us.

186
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,240
Oh, where am I?

187
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:03,740
Whoa.

188
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:06,440
This looks like a dangerous place now.

189
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:10,180
Oh, there's nobody here.

190
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:15,360
Wait, it says matching progress and now it disappeared.

191
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:20,140
Alright, looks like we're gonna be doing PvE.

192
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:23,220
Okay, it can't be that scary.

193
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:25,800
Alright, PvE.

194
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:28,680
It can't be that scary.

195
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,340
Matchmaking has started.

196
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,920
Alright, there we go.

197
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:35,940
We go in.

198
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:39,760
Okay, this one's instant because, like, there's no...

199
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:45,780
It's PvE, so there's no, like, threats of other people killing me.

200
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:50,280
It's spooky, man.

201
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:51,940
Alright.

202
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:56,100
Alright, we'll start.

203
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,680
We'll try PvE then.

204
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:03,140
I think it's just because, like, only the demo is out, so there's not enough of a player base right now to do...

205
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:07,020
To do, like, the normal mode.

206
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:12,360
Alright, there's no way a bot's gonna kill me, guys, right?

207
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,940
Who else here?

208
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:15,820
Hello, everybody.

209
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:18,540
What happened to everybody that's following me?

210
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,080
No way, right?

211
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,880
We should be fine, right?

212
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:26,940
We should...

213
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:29,580
I feel fine.

214
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:34,420
Okay, see, look at this.

215
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,920
I know all the combos.

216
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,160
Dodge.

217
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,060
That's all I need to know, right?

218
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:43,080
Let me actually look at my bindings.

219
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,460
Just to be sure.

220
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:48,000
Okay, control shift, look around.

221
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:49,840
Yeah.

222
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:51,200
Oh wait, combat.

223
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:53,640
Sorry, I forgot about the most important part.

224
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,040
Q-E-R-T.

225
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,540
Q-E-R-T.

226
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,000
Oh shit!

227
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:00,780
What?

228
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,480
Oh wait, yeah, there it is.

229
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,760
I forgot about this.

230
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:05,980
All right, Q.

231
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,800
Oh, I should... Oh, I should try... Yeah.

232
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:12,820
I mean, here's me crushing.

233
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,220
Oh, I could have done... I could have done squads for this.

234
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,940
Maybe I'll do squads after this game.

235
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,680
So I got a cool-ass skill.

236
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,420
My extraction action.

237
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:26,100
I sound... I increased the overall volume, too.

238
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,140
So let me know if it's better.

239
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:27,700
Whoa.

240
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:28,560
Whoa.

241
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:29,800
Oh, my God.

242
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:30,640
Is that the cube?

243
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:31,980
Oh, my God.

244
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:33,760
The cube consumes me.

245
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:34,260
Alright.

246
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,220
Go into the cube.

247
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:37,120
Oh, there we go.

248
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:39,520
The cube is calling for me.

249
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,360
Cube has been located.

250
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,080
It's real.

251
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:46,380
The cube.

252
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,280
Where am I?

253
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:51,280
Oh, this looks...

254
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,160
Very...

255
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:54,900
Uh...

256
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:55,400
Safe?

257
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,260
Transported me into a...

258
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:00,680
Oh.

259
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,660
Is he a bad...

260
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:04,440
Does he look like a bad person?

261
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:05,520
Oh, yeah.

262
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:06,740
No, that's a bad person.

263
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,700
Oh, that's right.

264
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,520
There we go.

265
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:17,780
Goodbye, Johnny.

266
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:18,960
What did Johnny have?

267
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,280
A radio receiver?

268
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:22,280
Wait, is that gun?

269
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,480
Oh, no, it's a machete.

270
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:24,220
Goodbye.

271
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,540
He's just some guy chilling.

272
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,020
Just had a bad trip.

273
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:31,800
He killed Johnny.

274
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:33,080
What the fuck?

275
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,200
Bro, Johnny was just tripping.

276
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:41,360
Oh my god, that guy has been doing too much with his free time.

277
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:46,000
That guy looks weight.

278
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:50,160
That guy is spending too much time alone.

279
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,700
Oh my god, Johnny's buff-ass friend.

280
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:58,280
Okay.

281
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:01,800
Oh, my god, he's punching me.

282
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:03,000
Okay.

283
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,260
Is he hitting me?

284
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:06,820
I can't...

285
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:07,120

And then, uh, how do I eat this?

290
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:49,670
Oh, shit.

291
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:50,830
Johnny, please don't come over.

292
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:51,890
I'm trying to figure out how to eat.

293
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:54,770
Oh, there you go.

294
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:58,090

Om, yum.

297
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:04,610
Okay, there you go.

298
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:05,470
We're good.

299
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:08,510
Alright, we're gonna try and kill this guy.

300
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:09,070
Hope I...

301
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:10,370
I don't regret this.

302
00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:10,750
Oh!

303
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:15,130
Guys, I might have...

304
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:16,950
Oh, shit.

305
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:19,850
Instant...

306
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:21,250
Wait, it broke?

307
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:23,090
Holy shit!

308
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:25,090
What kind of...

309
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:28,110
Bro, how did it already glide?

310
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:29,970
How did it already break?

311
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:31,750
Yeah, it was...

312
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:33,170
It said rare.

313
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:34,970
Okay.

314
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:36,450
It's fine.

315
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:38,670
Where did Johnny go?

316
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:41,310
Oh, shit!

317
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:42,750
Oh, fuck!

318
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:43,370
Wait!

319
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:45,490
I wasn't aware!

320
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:49,690
The cube will be destroyed in six... Oh, my God.

321
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:50,190
Goodbye.

322
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:51,250
Goodbye.

323
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:54,050
I was too busy exploring.

324
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:55,330
Oh, my God.

325
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:56,890
I have to leave the cube.

326
00:30:57,950 --> 00:30:58,850
Okay, don't worry.

327
00:30:58,950 --> 00:30:59,470
It's fine.

328
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:01,010
Okay, that's good.

329
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:02,830
That's good that we have a guide.

330
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:04,610
Goodbye, everyone.

331
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:07,190

00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:16,740
Okay, it's fine.

335
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:17,700
I'm okay.

336
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,200
I'm not okay, but like, I'm okay.

337
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:22,780
Okay, let's heal.

338
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,860
I don't think he sees me.

339
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,560
I don't think he sees me.

340
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,540
He will see.

341
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:33,980
Okay, we're gonna heal real quick.

342
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:35,560
We're gonna heal.

343
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:38,760
Alright.

344
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:41,680
Let's hope it opens up by then.

345
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:48,740
All right, and then I'll also yam yam yam yam

346
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:59,980
Okay, this guy took so much HP Holy oh my god literally just got here.

347
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:15,660
Oh my god, please Chill I just got here Oh my god, oh my god, there's another one I'll get the archer first I'll get the him I'll get him first before I get this guy.

348
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:17,960
Oh my god, this guy fucking sucks.

349
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:19,520
He sucks.

350
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,920
He actually sucks.

351
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:22,880
Please.

352
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:25,200
Oh!

353
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,140
Oh god.

354
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,180
I'll kill him first.

355
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,700
I have to like make sure my stamina is okay.

356
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,440
Okay, we got him out of the way.

357
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:43,460
Oh my god, this...

358
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:44,280
I don't like this guy.

359
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,780
This guy is so fucking...

360
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:47,320
He's so tanky.

361
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:50,260
Okay.

362
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,320
It's fine.

363
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:54,340
I still have time before the cube starts killing itself.

364
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:55,780
Alright, there you go.

365
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,100
I have an Oculus.

366
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:59,040
Okay, I should need more heals, though.

367
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:01,660
Three?

368
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:03,680
Kill time.

369
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,280
Okay.

370
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:08,280
I got...

371
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,160
What is that?

372
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,080
Detergent spray.

373
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,840
Guys, I do not have that much aura.

374
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:17,980
I just, I just started it.

375
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:21,060
Why do I have detergent spray?

376
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:24,040
Uh-oh, sinky.

377
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:24,840
Oh, nice.

378
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:30,060
Uh, used to, is now used for breaking other things.

379
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:34,560
It doesn't say how much, uh, when it breaks, though.

380
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:37,420
So, like, I'm a little scared about that.

381
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:39,920
Okay, I gotta get this guy.

382
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:40,720
Oh, God.

383
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,380
Oh, God, we gotta go.

384
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,380
Okay, there's a key.

385
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,380
cube here.

386
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:48,520
Oh!

387
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:51,160
That's fine.

388
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:52,520
We just...

389
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,640
We don't need to escape.

390
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:56,420
Oh, I guess that's how you, like, leave the cube.

391
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:58,400
That's alright.

392
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,680
We'll go to the next level.

393
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,920
Surely that won't fuck us up, right?

394
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:04,360
Can I go?

395
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,160
Now I'm here.

396
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,040
Yeah, I can't get over here.

397
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:12,420
Oh my god!

398
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,840
He's shooting me through!

399
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:14,380
Bro!

400
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,500
I can't even through the cube.

401
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,500
Bro, stop.

402
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:20,980
Okay.

403
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:24,180
The rocks can apparently get me.

404
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:25,160
Alright.

405
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,260
There should be a...

406
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:32,900
Alright, what does snow get me now?

407
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,340
Am I cold?

408
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:39,980
Am I...

409
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:40,380
Oh.

410
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:41,960
Oh, it locked up.

411
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:43,120
Okay.

412
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,380
We go this way.

413
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,580
Or we could go this way.

414
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:47,980
That doesn't really matter, right?

415
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:55,140
I don't feel safe down here.

416
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:58,280
It feels so...

417
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,160
I don't know.

418
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,860
It's awfully quiet.

419
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:06,580
It's very quiet and empty.

420
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,680
I do not feel safe at all.

421
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:15,100
Oh.

422
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:16,680
Oh, they're like...

423
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:17,580
Oh, my God.

424
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,300
No, never mind.

425
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:19,360
I feel very safe.

426
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:47,760
wait is she like calling for people to come down okay how strong is she oh shit i'm so that's scary oh my god i wasted my okay all right what does she get me she just get me binoculars that's it to be fair i don't think she has room to carry anything okay it's a hospital

427
00:36:50,800 --> 00:37:17,100

428
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,140
That's not heals.

429
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:22,600
Okay.

430
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,940
This might be a 07 time.

431
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:27,500
I think.

432
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,000
Yeah, I'm most likely gonna die here.

433
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:34,040
I think when I squat up, it'll be like so much easier.

434
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:38,480
Go upstairs.

435
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:40,900
Maybe I can find the cube up here.

436
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:44,760
I don't know.

437
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,440
Any escape cubes anywhere?

438
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:53,000
There's so many escape cubes from like the other room.

439
00:37:58,630 --> 00:38:00,470
Yeah, there's nothing up here on the roof.

440
00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:03,490
This is a very dangerous hospital.

441
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:06,570
You would think for a hospital, there'd be...

442
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:07,510
Oh, there it is.

443
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:08,650
Oh, my God.

444
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:09,670
There it is.

445
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:10,930
I see it.

446
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:12,350
Wait, I wonder if I can...

447
00:38:12,350 --> 00:38:13,630
Oh, no, no, no, no.

448
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:14,810
Okay, I think he could hit me.

449
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:17,970
I was going to say, I wonder if I could cheese it, but I think he could cheese it.

450
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:22,270
Okay.

451
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:24,510
Hit.

452
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:27,670
I don't think I can make the first...

453
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:32,330
hit yeah i was gonna say there's no way i can make the first hit

454
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:59,830

456
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:23,960
How is that supposed to know?

457
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,720
Oh my god, the axe is so slow.

458
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:35,060
Okay, turn this down and then Sound guys said turn the sound effects down.

459
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:40,400
All right, guys, we're squatting up All right, everybody.

460
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:43,640
Okay, squad time.

461
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:45,140
We might be able to get a lot of people.

462
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,320
We might be able to kill a lot of people in the squad.

463
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:48,240
I believe.

464
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,780
All right, squad up.

465
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,140
Solo squad up.

466
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:51,740
Let's go.

467
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,920
We just need two people.

468
00:39:59,140 --> 00:39:59,760
Two more people.

469
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:00,540
I'm in cat.

470
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:00,840
Oh, wait.

471
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,380
I don't know if it's like server reliant.

472
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:04,120
I'm on Canada servers.

473
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:05,400
Oh my God.

474
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,100
You got a shink.

475
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:07,420
But yeah, about got an axe.

476
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:08,480
That's all you got.

477
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:09,520
You got a shink.

478
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,860
That doesn't mean I got a fucking axe.

479
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:12,980
Boom.

480
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,600
Yeah, I'm in Canada servers.

481
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:17,640
There's only one.

482
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,620
I don't know if it like.

483
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:20,600
I don't know.

484
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:25,460
I don't know if like squad depends on like where server you're located.

485
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:29,320
Like, this is a general lobby where it's all the servers combined.

486
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,940
And he has the London special.

487
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:33,940
Oh, I can't emote.

488
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,100
I don't got no emotes.

489
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,140
Oh, that's cute.

490
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:39,160
You can, like, chain...

491
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,960
You can have, like, a dual hair...

492
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,040
I like hair colors.

493
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:44,580
No, it's literally just Canada.

494
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:47,080
That's literally my server.

495
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:48,760
It was literally just Canada.

496
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,280
And I was like, oh, that's me.

497
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:50,820
There you go.

498
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,100
I guess the...

499
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,520
Let's start a match.

500
00:40:55,540 --> 00:41:08,620

502
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,740
We're missing one more.

503
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:36,540
One more gamer.

504
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:38,680
We have this.

505
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,560
I'm pretty sure Cryow Wolf is gonna be in the squad.

506
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:42,620
We have Cryow Wolf.

507
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:43,660
We have Jay.

508
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,460
We're literally missing it.

509
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,800
We're at PvE.

510
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:49,460
PvE squad.

511
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:51,880
Because I don't know if we can get a normal squad.

512
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:53,160
A normal going on.

513
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:55,420
I'm gonna try for the last time.

514
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,660
For the last like.

515
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:01,080

00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:10,140

00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:42,260
I literally just need one more in my squad.

525
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:44,980
Please, whatever...

526
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:45,760
Oh, geez.

00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:50,940
Will anyone, please, queue up!

528
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:54,460
That's it.

529
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:55,660
I'm sorry, bros.

530
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,360
Guys, I gotta go solo.

531
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:27,940

532
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:28,500
guys.

533
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:31,820
It wasn't meant to be.

534
00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:37,790
I waited, though.

535
00:43:37,830 --> 00:43:39,230
I gave them the time.

536
00:43:39,730 --> 00:43:40,830
Try again.

537
00:43:44,870 --> 00:43:46,990
Alright, I'm more geared up now.

538
00:43:48,130 --> 00:43:53,690
I think I feel like they have to adjust the cube area because it's so...

539
00:43:53,690 --> 00:43:55,250
It feels like such a show.

540
00:43:55,430 --> 00:43:55,650
Oh, wait.

541
00:43:55,870 --> 00:43:57,090
Two out of 30?

542
00:43:57,510 --> 00:43:59,510
Where the fuck is the second guy?

543
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:00,810
Oh, there they are.

544
00:44:01,410 --> 00:44:01,930
Who's...

545
00:44:01,950 --> 00:44:02,950
Who's that over there?

546
00:44:03,730 --> 00:44:04,710
Are we gonna meet up?

547
00:44:05,670 --> 00:44:06,190
Oh, hey.

548
00:44:07,430 --> 00:44:08,050
Hey there.

549
00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:10,030
Wait, we could start teaming.

550
00:44:10,570 --> 00:44:11,490
Who's gonna report us?

551
00:44:11,530 --> 00:44:12,430
There's only two of us.

552
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:13,450
Unless she...

553
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:14,730
I'll report you first.

554
00:44:17,570 --> 00:44:22,110
I don't say who's gonna report us.

555
00:44:22,170 --> 00:44:23,310
There's just two of us.

556
00:44:23,690 --> 00:44:24,070
I'll report.

557
00:44:24,170 --> 00:44:26,430
If you report me, I'll report you.

558
00:44:26,970 --> 00:44:30,110
I just be me anyway.

559
00:44:31,950 --> 00:44:33,670
We're in the bath.

560
00:44:35,290 --> 00:44:37,690
Just the two of us.

561
00:44:39,950 --> 00:44:42,090
Just the two of us.

562
00:44:43,710 --> 00:44:45,530
I wonder if we started the same area.

563
00:44:45,930 --> 00:44:46,810
Or are they going to split us?

564
00:44:46,830 --> 00:44:48,370
I feel like they'd split us off, right?

565
00:44:48,470 --> 00:44:50,590
Because if there's 30 people in the lobby.

566
00:44:52,210 --> 00:44:54,370
Mutually assured destruction.

567
00:44:55,050 --> 00:44:55,510
Exactly.

568
00:44:57,430 --> 00:44:57,950
All right.

569
00:44:58,550 --> 00:44:59,510
Our sound team.

570
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:01,210
I hope the sound is all right.

571
00:45:02,250 --> 00:45:03,630
What are you gonna do?

572
00:45:04,730 --> 00:45:05,130
Bad me?

573
00:45:06,290 --> 00:45:07,130
I'm sponsored.

574
00:45:07,630 --> 00:45:08,950
I'm bad immunity.

575
00:45:09,230 --> 00:45:10,290
You have nothing.

576
00:45:11,570 --> 00:45:12,590
You're not sponsored.

577
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:14,070
You don't have immunity.

578
00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:19,750
Alright.

579
00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:20,970
Ten.

580
00:45:21,330 --> 00:45:23,470
I see you on the other side.

581
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:26,050
The cube calls for me.

582
00:45:29,350 --> 00:46:00,730
I feel like the actual game might be one beat me up i feel like the actual game must be longer in the queue because there's a demo you know because like i feel like in the demo we have to like go through more stuff like they want us to check out more things so i feel like in the demo it's like a lot shorter okay oh that was fast oh my item isn't jacked up that was jacked up item there

583
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:05,800
I'm strong.

584
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:10,000
I wonder if we are in the same area.

585
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:13,480
Well, there's the entrance for one of the cube.

586
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:15,860
I don't see any chests, though.

587
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:18,720
There you go.

588
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:20,320
Yeah, this is my item.

589
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:20,980
It's so strong.

590
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:22,000
Oh, I have peanut butter.

591
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:23,500
Nice.

592
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:25,460
I scroll and ate me.

593
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:26,320
What is this scroll?

594
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:28,040
An ancient scroll.

595
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:30,260
Once the seal is broken, it's content.

596
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:33,860
Yes, for some reason, everyone fears it will...

597
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,020
Oh shit!

598
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:35,840
Johnny?

599
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:40,920
Oh my god, so...

600
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:43,720
Oh my god, he did a combo on me.

601
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:44,500
Hey Johnny.

602
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:46,260
You know what?

603
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:47,280
Uh...

604
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:49,020
Nah, I shouldn't use it.

605
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:50,120
Alright.

606
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:53,320
I like how his name is just Johnny.

607
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:54,360
It's just so random.

608
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,260
Oh shit, that's...

609
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:58,180
Wait, it's just regular pants.

610
00:46:58,360 --> 00:46:59,200
It's a normal pants.

611
00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:00,100
I already have that.

612
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:03,980
No way he's gonna turn around, is he?

613
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,860
You turn around.

614
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:07,160
Oh, cool.

615
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:08,220
I got pants again.

616
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:10,340
Oh, my God.

617
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:10,920
I missed.

618
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:13,060
I missed that.

619
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:14,840
Okay.

620
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:18,020
Jesus Christ.

621
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:20,420
I have to let him hit first.

622
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:22,700
My charge up is too much.

623
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:24,740
But, yeah, I'll just heal now.

624
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:27,020
I have too much charge up time.

625
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:34,560
I mean, the damage is good.

626
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:35,480
I just have so much.

627
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:36,780
Charge up.

628
00:47:40,610 --> 00:47:41,250
Yeah.

629
00:47:42,270 --> 00:47:43,090
My turn.

630
00:47:44,550 --> 00:47:45,050
Alright.

631
00:47:46,210 --> 00:47:47,510
Cube has opened.

632
00:47:47,730 --> 00:47:48,810
Oh, it's over here.

633
00:47:50,010 --> 00:47:53,590
I haven't seen my gal J yet.

634
00:47:53,730 --> 00:47:54,610
Where did she go?

635
00:47:55,690 --> 00:47:57,650
She hasn't showed up.

636
00:47:59,430 --> 00:48:02,590
I wonder if she's in the same arena as me.

637
00:48:03,910 --> 00:48:05,850
Or she got transported so far.

638
00:48:07,690 --> 00:48:09,110
Oh, you should win it, Johnny.

639
00:48:09,590 --> 00:48:10,650
It's so tanky.

640
00:48:11,610 --> 00:48:12,570
Ooh, a compass.

641
00:48:13,430 --> 00:48:14,490
I feel like I need that.

642
00:48:15,450 --> 00:48:16,850
Well, I guess I don't.

643
00:48:19,970 --> 00:48:20,930
Oh, just spit.

644
00:48:21,030 --> 00:48:21,950
Oh, it's broken.

645
00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:25,050
Okay, that was like, I feel like I need this compass.

646
00:48:25,710 --> 00:48:27,530
Oh, guess I don't.

647
00:48:29,330 --> 00:48:29,650
Okay.

648
00:48:30,670 --> 00:48:32,370
The door is open.

649
00:48:32,810 --> 00:48:35,530
And I'm like, I should go now or...

650
00:48:35,530 --> 00:48:36,890
Oh, I guess I go now.

651
00:48:37,030 --> 00:48:39,510
The game- the game has spoken.

652
00:48:40,030 --> 00:48:41,470
You go now.

653
00:48:42,130 --> 00:48:42,130
Okay.

654
00:48:43,010 --> 00:48:43,450
Goodbye.

655
00:48:45,770 --> 00:48:47,490
Oh, oh, it's back here.

656
00:48:47,590 --> 00:48:47,810
Okay.

657
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:49,650
Oh, it's the same area.

658
00:48:49,950 --> 00:48:51,990
It's like the same world.

659
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:55,510
Because it's- oh, I'm in like a- wait, no, actually it's different.

660
00:48:56,630 --> 00:48:57,750
It's an amusement park.

661
00:49:02,470 --> 00:49:04,670
Yeah, you told me to move along.

662
00:49:05,650 --> 00:49:06,290
Okay, nice.

663
00:49:06,330 --> 00:49:07,050
There's a box.

664
00:49:07,810 --> 00:49:08,690
Box tab.

665
00:49:12,850 --> 00:50:09,550

That's right!

You ain't gonna get my items now.

674
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:32,040
You don't need these.

675
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:34,220
There we go.

676
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:34,980
Alright, go.

677
00:50:35,580 --> 00:50:36,680
Go get that guy.

00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:39,160
Get him.

679
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:41,300
I believe in you.

680
00:50:42,020 --> 00:50:42,380
Go Jay.

681
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:44,220
Jay, Jay, turn around.

682
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:45,240
Jay, you got this.

683
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:47,280
You go, Jay.

684
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:49,920
I feel like I should help.

685
00:50:51,660 --> 00:50:52,180
Alright.

686
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:53,160
Nice.

687
00:50:53,820 --> 00:50:53,820
Okay.

688
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:55,700
Got some heal items.

689
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:57,840
Wait, my inventory is full.

690
00:50:58,560 --> 00:50:59,620
Wait, that can happen?

691
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:03,900
Oh, it's a better.

692
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,420
Oh my god, it's premium band-aids in this crew.

693
00:51:06,740 --> 00:51:08,580
That, guys, you know it's premium.

694
00:51:10,420 --> 00:51:13,260
It's Premium Band-Aid, and it's a Korean.

695
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:20,500
That's how good this Band-Aid is, chat.

696
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:24,300
Top tier Band-Aid right there.

697
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:26,280
It's so Premium.

698
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:30,020
Wait.

699
00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:32,560
Oh my god, he's wearing a cube.

700
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:35,020
I have so many items.

701
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:37,640
I should have, I should have actually...

702
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:42,420
Wait, that's just my normal band-aid.

703
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:46,620
Oh, there's a band-aid and there's standard band-aid.

704
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:48,960
I feel like I should just use my...

705
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:50,260
I feel like I should just use this.

706
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:53,120
Alright.

707
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:56,780
We gotta figure our way out of here.

708
00:51:57,800 --> 00:51:58,460
Wait, actually, no.

709
00:51:58,540 --> 00:51:59,460
I already figured...

710
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:00,540
Come here and follow me, Jay.

711
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:01,780
Where's Jay?

712
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:02,400
Jay, follow me.

713
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:04,640
I know where the next area is.

714
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:08,060
It's like right here.

715
00:52:09,140 --> 00:52:09,620
Oh my god.

716
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:10,220
Women.

717
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:13,160
There she go.

718
00:52:13,740 --> 00:52:14,440
Alright, J killer.

719
00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:17,540
J.

720
00:52:17,980 --> 00:52:18,040
J.

721
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:18,660
J.

722
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:19,700
J.

723
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:21,180
Are you okay?

724
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:22,120
J.

725
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:22,560
Killer.

726
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:24,740
J.

727
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Killer.

728
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:26,640
Kill this nurse.

729
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:29,380
Don't worry, I'm your only witness.

730
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:30,420
They'll never know.

731
00:52:32,820 --> 00:52:33,440
There you go.

732
00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:35,720
There you go.

733
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:38,180
Oh my god.

734
00:52:38,340 --> 00:52:39,600
She's so tanky.

735
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:42,640
Oh my god, where did he come from?

736
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:44,840
Okay, I should help Jay out.

737
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:47,300
Alright, there we go.

738
00:52:48,060 --> 00:52:50,240
I was like, where the fuck did she come from?

739
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:52,020
Alright, well, Leach is nice.

740
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:53,740
Alright, let's go.

741
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:57,760
Um, I fucked up.

742
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:58,620
Okay, I fucked up.

743
00:52:58,660 --> 00:52:59,160
We gotta figure.

744
00:52:59,220 --> 00:53:02,080
Okay, Jay, um, um, I fucked up.

745
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:07,480
I didn't realize that, um, that- Oh my gosh, that was not the right area.

746
00:53:07,540 --> 00:53:08,440
Okay, we go this way.

747
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:10,300
It's fine.

748
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:11,220
I can run past this.

749
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:12,300
Okay, Jay, we gotta run.

750
00:53:12,460 --> 00:53:14,200
Jay, we're gonna get absorbed into the cube.

751
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:15,340
We have 20 seconds.

752
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:16,220
Oh, my God.

753
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:16,860
How far is this?

754
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:18,440
Wait, this is actually pretty far.

755
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:21,260
Okay, it's this way.

756
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:22,980
Follow me, Jay.

757
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:24,360
If you wanna live.

758
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:28,340
I might have fucked it up for us.

759
00:53:29,020 --> 00:53:29,580
Oh, my God.

760
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:30,000
Six.

761
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:31,340
Oh, no.

762
00:53:31,820 --> 00:53:32,360
Oh, no.

763
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:33,920
Jay, goodbye, Jay.

764
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:34,740
Goodbye.

765
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:40,420
I swear.

766
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:55,040
We might have fucked up.

767
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:59,160
Jay, we like Luke Goblin a bit too much.

768
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:00,640
Oh my god!

769
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:04,640
Every Star Lord!

770
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:07,940
How do you keep getting more gear than us?

771
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:10,880
Okay, I need to put some stuff away.

772
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:13,460
Alright.

773
00:54:14,580 --> 00:54:15,840
Um, I'm poor.

774
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:17,220
I gotta put my items away.

775
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:19,720
I don't even know what to do right now.

776
00:54:19,820 --> 00:54:22,580
Oh wait, it has to be the crafting area, right?

777
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:23,480
Like here?

778
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:26,560
Let's try squad.

779
00:54:26,780 --> 00:54:28,540
Maybe we have enough now for a squad.

780
00:54:29,180 --> 00:54:30,780
Why do we do this?

781
00:54:30,820 --> 00:54:32,780
Because so that I can get here instantly.

782
00:54:34,620 --> 00:54:35,380
Oh, there you go.

783
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:36,980
It must be that, right?

784
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:41,280
Random crafting.

785
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:43,600
Do I have anything?

786
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:44,240
I don't.

787
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:46,400
I'm so poor.

788
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,760
I could sell my stuff.

789
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:51,000
I need to figure out where to sell.

790
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:53,660
Okay, this is my storage.

791
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:54,420
Storage.

792
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:55,360
Save your stuff.

793
00:54:57,860 --> 00:54:59,480
Oh, wait, do I have your radio?

794
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:01,140
I have so many radios.

795
00:55:01,580 --> 00:55:02,540
Surely, like, one of them.

796
00:55:02,620 --> 00:55:03,220
Oh, nice!

797
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:08,220
Alright.

798
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:11,740
Uh...

799
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:14,400
I'll just put everything over there.

800
00:55:15,060 --> 00:55:15,900
Fuck it.

801
00:55:16,620 --> 00:55:18,360
These are, like, all my equipment, anyway.

802
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:19,320
And my pants.

803
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,880
If I ever lose my pants, I have this.

804
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:25,260
Alright.

00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:56,000

Okay, we'll make our squad in solos.

808
00:56:01,420 --> 00:56:03,360
We have four minutes to do this.

809
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:04,080
All right.

810
00:56:08,180 --> 00:56:09,620
We can do it.

811
00:56:09,980 --> 00:56:11,580
We'll make our own squad.

812
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:13,560
Wait, I'm still by myself.

813
00:56:15,820 --> 00:56:17,220
Team minus four minutes.

814
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:18,460
We got this team.

815
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:22,280
Team, why does it say one out of 13?

816
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:23,420
Team?

817
00:56:27,580 --> 00:56:29,780
Guys, wait, what happened?

818
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:31,800
My instructors were so clear.

819
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:39,180
Guys, what happened?

820
00:56:39,860 --> 00:56:43,860
I said we all go solo and we make our own squad.

821
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:46,920
Why is it say 1 out of 30?

822
00:56:47,420 --> 00:56:51,540
Why did your team was gone three years ago?

823
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:57,660
They're going solos.

824
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:01,560
Guys, I said we make a squad in solo.

825
00:57:02,140 --> 00:57:04,000
Where did my team go?

826
00:57:04,860 --> 00:57:09,760
What if, like, I, like, queued up solo and then everyone got a game in squads?

827
00:57:10,380 --> 00:57:15,980
At the same time, don't you believe the accident wasn't your fault?

828
00:57:17,860 --> 00:57:19,260
I can't believe it.

829
00:57:19,340 --> 00:57:22,360
Wait, they all, they got put in a different queue?

830
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:31,460
They all got together except for me and so that's not fair.

831
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:33,480
Are you kidding me?

832
00:57:33,740 --> 00:57:34,800
I don't even care.

833
00:57:35,580 --> 00:57:37,960
It's like you're not invited.

834
00:57:39,740 --> 00:57:43,140
Toki's not invited to this party.

835
00:57:43,940 --> 00:57:44,180
No.

836
00:57:48,810 --> 00:57:51,790
I can't believe they did this to you.

837
00:57:51,810 --> 00:57:52,710
I can't hit it.

838
00:57:52,710 --> 00:57:53,890
We have two more minutes.

839
00:57:54,310 --> 00:57:55,530
We have two more minutes.

840
00:57:55,630 --> 00:57:58,410
in the demo before it goes into maintenance.

841
00:58:00,070 --> 00:58:00,790
It's alright.

842
00:58:01,010 --> 00:58:02,170
Me and the all I have.

843
00:58:02,370 --> 00:58:04,170
All I need is a cube.

844
00:58:05,370 --> 00:58:06,630
Let me in.

845
00:58:07,730 --> 00:58:08,410
Beat me up.

846
00:58:09,890 --> 00:58:12,370
The cube calls for me yet again.

847
00:58:12,970 --> 00:58:15,010
Me, myself, and I, the cube.

848
00:58:17,930 --> 00:58:18,330
Oh my god.

849
00:58:18,430 --> 00:58:19,290
It went 2 out of 30.

850
00:58:19,810 --> 00:58:20,330
Oh wait.

851
00:58:20,370 --> 00:58:21,670
This looks like a nice place.

852
00:58:23,310 --> 00:58:24,530
Who is the second guy?

853
00:58:25,290 --> 00:58:26,950
Oh it's They're in the same area.

854
00:58:28,430 --> 00:58:30,590
I thought we were in, like, a castle or so.

855
00:58:30,690 --> 00:58:31,270
Oh, my God.

856
00:58:31,850 --> 00:58:33,250
I'm just gonna kill him right now.

857
00:58:37,820 --> 00:58:38,600
Hello, Johnny.

858
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:41,040
This night...

859
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:42,480
Oh, I'm not afraid of you, Johnny.

860
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:44,740
I literally have one minute left in here.

861
00:58:45,420 --> 00:58:46,060
Oh, nice.

862
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:50,020
Oh, shit.

863
00:58:51,020 --> 00:58:55,360
Okay, I need him to hit first before I do my little charge-up.

864
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:57,740
I wonder what happens to me.

865
00:58:57,760 --> 00:58:59,020
Do I just get kicked out?

866
00:58:59,820 --> 00:59:00,660

867
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:03,880
In the middle of looting this box.

868
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:06,720
