1
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,800
Hello, everybody!

2
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,200
Hello, hello!

3
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:53,700
I'm sorry about... I'm still using the shitty mic, or, like, I don't know.

4
00:01:53,700 --> 00:02:04,060
It's not a shitty mic, it's a shirt mic, but, like, there's something wrong with it because it makes the sound, so I'm sorry that I now, like, made you guys pay attention to it now, so now you're like, oh my god, I can't unhear it.

5
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:06,420
Oh my god, why did you say that, Doki?

6
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:12,160
I lived in such an oblivious life, not noticing the sound that comes out when you use that mic.

7
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,660
Now I hear it all the time now!

8
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:17,560
I can't help but notice it all the time!

9
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,320
Okay, you guys don't hear it?

10
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,860
Oh, thank god, it might be my BGM.

11
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:32,280
Um, my BGM might be hiding the sound right now, or it might have fixed it, I don't know.

12
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,180
I could be gaslighting, I don't know.

13
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,140
Typical Doki, gaslighting.

14
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,140
I knew that Google Doki was, was real.

15
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,560
Boy, thank you for the Akasupa!

16
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:49,880
Thank you, thank you!

17
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,380
Welcome back, Doki!

18
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:52,920
Missed you my addiction!

19
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,860
Thank you!

20
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,700
Can we not?

21
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,420
I knew it!

22
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:07,060
I, yes, I can, uh, make jokes about it now because, uh, I, I've, like, moved past it.

23
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:10,520
I finally had my Google Doki archive.

24
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:18,120
Now I can't make jokes- Okay, I know you guys are like, now that you had to do a Google Doki, you can't make jokes about it anymore.

25
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:22,100
You can't make fun of other people for doing Google Doki's.

26
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,220
But I can!

27
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,460
Because I have nothing else in my life.

28
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:29,460
I, I, I, I, I,

29
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:51,820
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I,

30
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:57,980
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I Thank you for the magenta soupa.

31
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,420
Thank you, thank you.

32
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,940
Donkey bird!

33
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:04,300
By the way, I called out that weird noise months ago.

34
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,340
Months!

35
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:06,900
Thank you for the magenta soupa.

36
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,880
Thank you, thank you.

37
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:10,380
Yes, but...

38
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,540
I don't know why it makes that sense.

39
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:18,820
I assume it's my mic because it is quite old.

40
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:20,760
I got this like years ago.

41
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,200
So like this mic is quite old.

42
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,660
Um, and um...

43
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,440
I upgraded it to...

44
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,860
I don't even know what I upgraded it to.

45
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,560
I don't know anything about mics, guys.

46
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:34,580
I saw like all the suggestions.

47
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,960
And then I told my sound guy.

48
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,580
And I was like, what do I get?

49
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:44,540
And they're like, oh, it's a Newman TLM 102 condenser microphone.

50
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:46,780
Which could be...

51
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:47,800
It's not a cable issue.

52
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:51,960
My cable is like pretty good for my microphone.

53
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,080
I know for...

54
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:53,820
It's not a mic...

55
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,020
It's not a cable issue.

56
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,020
It's uh...

57
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,040
It's um...

58
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:01,000
I think it's a microphone issue for sure.

59
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,080
Uh...

60
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:02,920
So...

61
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,360
I...

62
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,560
I hope it is.

63
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:07,540
Because I bought an expensive microphone for it.

64
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,120
Uh...

65
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,460
So I hope it is.

66
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:10,380
Um...

67
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:11,000
But yes...

68
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,380
Uh...

69
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:13,580
I was away for an entire week.

70
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:14,620
Um...

71
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:17,500
Because I finally had my Google Doki arc.

72
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,780
And at that...

73
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,140
And also I had to take care of dad.

74
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,440
Dad's home, by the way, guys.

75
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:22,660
Um...

76
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:23,340
Dad's home.

77
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:24,580
Um...

78
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:25,880
And uh...

79
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,060
Uh...

80
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:28,740
Uh...

81
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:29,400
I think it...

82
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,280
Oh, so by the way...

83
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,000
Uh...

84
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,440
I think it just has to do with the fact that my mic has like stuff on.

85
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,340
Like you know like...

86
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:36,640
Fluff on it.

87
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,440
So like...

88
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,460
I assume that's why it's like...

89
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:40,040
Whatever.

90
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,640
It's something to do with my mic.

91
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,380
Um...

92
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:42,860
But yes...

93
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:44,760
Doki Amber Doge is home now.

94
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:51,320
And, um, I had to, you know, adjust my schedule to take care of him.

95
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:54,020
And, uh, because he has his own schedule now.

96
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:58,220
I have to walk him three times a day versus the usual two times a day.

97
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,580
Uh, and then so I have to slowly readjust to it.

98
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,960
And also, like, he has a...

99
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:08,560
Okay, this little fucker, he has a special kidney diet now that he has to eat.

100
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,100
Um, which is wet food.

101
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:13,860
You know, he is so happy.

102
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:20,940
He is so fucking happy that, yeah, his kidneys are failing.

103
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,640
And if we skip what if we...

104
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:28,740
By the way, so, um, so, yeah, he...

105
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:29,460
Yeah, so he...

106
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:38,340
And I can only buy this particular wet food because it's, like, a specially prescribed veterinarian food for kidney diets.

107
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:43,240
So, like, uh, I can only get this food at the veterinarian.

108
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,440
So, and it's, like, canned food.

109
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,460
Canned wet food.

110
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:49,160
So, he's a little special boy right now.

111
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,140
He's a fancy dog at the moment.

112
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:57,500
Um, and because, uh, he also, every day, he needs to have this specific medication for his kidneys.

113
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,940
Um, because I forgot what his...

114
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,660
I don't remember what the kidney...

115
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:04,300
I mean, they gave me a document saying what it is.

116
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:08,220
Uh, but, like, obviously, I don't remember what thing...

117
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,700
What he has on the top of my head.

118
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,280
I should remember it on the top...

119
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,060
I'm getting pen insurance.

120
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,560
I need to figure out how to get pen insurance.

121
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,360
I...

122
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,820
I need to...

123
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:18,000
I need to figure out how to get pen insurance.

124
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:22,420
Because I need to get prescription for this fucking kidney medication.

125
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,360
And, um, his wet food.

126
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,820
He's like, ooh la la.

127
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,660
I get wet food now every single day.

128
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:30,980
Ooh la la.

129
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:33,460
Ah, because my kidneys are failing.

130
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,480
Okay, his kidneys aren't failing, by the way.

131
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:40,480
It's just that he's peeing out protein.

132
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:43,500
And so, he has, like, um...

133
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:48,900
He has a medication to make sure that he doesn't pee out more of his protein.

134
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,580
So, he's like, ooh la la.

135
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,320
My kidneys are so fucked up.

136
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,720
But I get to have wet food.

137
00:07:55,880 --> 00:08:01,100
If I skip my medication, I could potentially have a stroke.

138
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,580
Ooh la la.

139
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:04,300
Yippee.

140
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:06,200
Wet food diet.

141
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:07,460
Yum yum.

142
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:12,920
Yippee.

143
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,420
Worth it.

144
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,900
Fancy boy.

145
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,180
Okay, why are you...

146
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:24,160
Okay, not maybe a day, guys.

147
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,300
Not a day.

148
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,680
It's more so, like...

149
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:30,040
Okay, apparently for dogs, um...

150
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:33,860
A stroke for dogs are, like, different from strokes for humans.

151
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:34,740
So, when a...

152
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:35,740
I don't know what it...

153
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:37,020
I don't know what it means.

154
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:40,140
But, like, they were like, oh yeah, um...

155
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:43,680
Just make sure he has this medication and monitor him.

156
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:44,640
And medication.

157
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,920
And he should be fine.

158
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,020
But, like...

159
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:52,660
Because it's, like, basically, if he pees out too much of his protein, he would, like...

160
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:54,120
His brain will go funny.

161
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,240
Uh...

162
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:59,160
His brain will go really funny if he pees too much protein.

163
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,360
So, like...

164
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,800
So, I have to make sure he has his medication and he eats...

165
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,840
Has his fancy wet food diet.

166
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,220
So, he doesn't pee out all his protein.

167
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,300
So, yeah.

168
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:09,700
I...

169
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,420
I don't know.

170
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,260
Um...

171
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,960
But he's happy, at least.

172
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,080
Uh...

173
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,180
At least...

174
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:16,500
Uh...

175
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:22,820
At least he's, like, really, really happy that he gets to live the life right now.

176
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:23,680
Um...

177
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,880
By the way, he is now not allowed on top of my bed.

178
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:32,860
I bought, like, three ramps and I positioned it all around my bed.

179
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:39,200
Because that's literally the only place he could jump off and, like, try to jump on my bed.

180
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,580
So, I've got three ramps to place around my bed.

181
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,960
And you know what the...

182
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,240
Okay.

183
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,660
It freaked me the fuck out.

184
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:50,400
Because two days ago, um...

185
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:50,780
Um...

186
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:53,480
He heard a knock on the door because I ordered, like, delivery.

187
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:59,000
And then he jumped off the bed when the ramp was next to him.

188
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,060
Like, literally...

189
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:00,180
Okay.

190
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:00,980
Not even next to him.

191
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:01,680
It was, like, in...

192
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,160
The ramp was in front of him.

193
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:08,220
But he decided to jump off the bed next to the ramp.

194
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,600
And I was like, are you fucking...

195
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,100
And then I never let him on top.

196
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:15,820
And then after that, I moved all the ramps off the bed.

197
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:18,180
And it was the first day...

198
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:24,120
The first time he finally grew the courage to walk up the bed.

199
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,000
Because he had, like, PTSD.

200
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,240
He had PTSD over, like, going up the stairs on...

201
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,680
Going up the ramp on the bed.

202
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,680
Because, you know, that's where he fucking broke his back.

203
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:35,620
And...

204
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,940
That, like, literally that's how he broke his back.

205
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:38,720
So...

206
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,900
From, like, jumping off of the bed.

207
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,040
So, he had, like, PTSD from, like, walking up...

208
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:43,700
Like, you know...

209
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,000
Walking up the ramp to the bed.

210
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:50,160
And two days ago was the first time he finally was like, I'm a brave boy.

211
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,020
Like, he stood at the edge of the ramp.

212
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:54,960
And he's like, do I go up or do I not go up?

213
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,980
And then finally, he had the courage to go up the bed.

214
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:58,960
And he was so happy.

215
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:02,340
And he instantly crawled under my blankets and went to sleep next to me.

216
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:05,140
And then I was like, oh my god!

217
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,120
Dad, you're so brave!

218
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,220
I finally beat your trauma!

219
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:16,540
And then literally, two to three hours later, there was a knock on the door.

220
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:17,820
And he jumped off the bed.

221
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,740
And now he's not allowed to...

222
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:23,820
He's like, I conquered my trauma!

223
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,220
I'm unstoppable now!

224
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,580
Now I can do anything!

225
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,500
Even jump down!

226
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,820
And then...

227
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:36,200
And then...

228
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:40,300
So now I've moved all the ramps off my bed.

229
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,540
So I bought...

230
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:46,560
I spent money on three ramps for no fucking reason!

231
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:47,900
Yippee!

232
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:54,560
This is where your super chat money went to!

233
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:55,620
Yay!

234
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,320
I'm sorry.

235
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:58,260
I'm so sorry.

236
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:59,080
I thought...

237
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,540
I thought I could fix...

238
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:02,000
And you know what's even worse?

239
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,160
I tried to teach him with the tree.

240
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,760
You know, like...

241
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,680
Worth it!

242
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,220
I like...

243
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:09,600
You know, okay.

244
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,020
So like, you teach your dog to do the thing.

245
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:15,400
Where you put him up the stairs and then put him down the stairs.

246
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:16,520
So I did that.

247
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,800
I was like, here's the food.

248
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:18,840
Go up the stairs.

249
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,480
Now go down the stairs.

250
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:21,400
Also, matcha!

251
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,620
Welcome to Tomato Fire!

252
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,400
Welcome, welcome!

253
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,560
And I did that.

254
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:25,460
And I was like, yay!

255
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:26,500
You're learning!

256
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,620
You're learning!

257
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:28,640
And he unlearned it.

258
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,600
He unlearned the going down part.

259
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:31,200
He...

260
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,420
He could...

261
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:33,600
He has not...

262
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,000
He unlearned the going...

263
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,240
So I can't risk it.

264
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,320
Obviously, I can't fucking risk it.

265
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,620
Because I feel like he's gonna fucking forget again.

266
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:48,360
I can't pay another 10 grand for surgery number two.

267
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,460
He does not have that privilege.

268
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:52,820
I'm sorry.

269
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,760
It's like those billionaires that spend millions of dollars taking heart.

270
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:05,560
80-year-old billionaires spending millions of dollars taking heart transplants from young people being paid a win.

271
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,820
I can't do that for him.

272
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:07,880
I am sorry.

273
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:13,880
Like, I... At some point, he cannot keep... We cannot keep fixing his back.

274
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,000
Like, once is enough, guys.

275
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,980
Once is enough.

276
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,580
That's pretty privileged.

277
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,740
He just wants to be a silly billy.

278
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,760
Chotto, welcome to TomatoFarm.

279
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,640
Welcome, welcome.

280
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,920
Um, Mehdi, thank you for the super chat.

281
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:29,880
Thank you, thank you.

282
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,500
Rap number four.

283
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,460
Toma, thank you for the super chat.

284
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:34,500
Thank you, thank you.

285
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,340
Fancy food money.

286
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,380
Ian, welcome.

287
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:37,920
Thank you, though.

288
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,900
I'm gonna chat the super.

289
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,080
Thank you, thank you.

290
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,020
Here's to the dad jar.

291
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,980
Um, but yeah.

292
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:49,420
That was basically, um, how dad's doing at the moment.

293
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:54,060
Um, and, uh, I've been taking him to our dog park.

294
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:59,200
Um, that was near me because that's even closer to me rather than the usual.

295
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:05,140
So, there's a dog park near where I live that's, like, uh, um, that was recently built.

296
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:11,300
And, but, and it's, like, easily accessible to, like, where I am so I don't have to actually go out to get there.

297
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:19,380
And, like, the really... Okay, so, like, I bought a harness for him because in the past I used to... I just used, like, neck and leash.

298
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:23,800
Um, and, because, like, he wouldn't... He doesn't pull on his... He doesn't pull on his leash.

299
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:26,040
So, like, that's why I felt, like, confident.

300
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,920
Like, because usually you don't do that.

301
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,280
But, like, he never pulled on his leash.

302
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:30,920
So, I was, like, okay.

303
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,140
And he hated harnesses.

304
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,460
So, dad hated harnesses.

305
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:37,840
So, I never... I tried... I tried to give him harnesses when he was growing up.

306
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:38,940
But he fucking hated it.

307
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,000
So, I was, like, okay.

308
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:40,840
Neck and leash.

309
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:41,640
Because he doesn't pull.

310
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,580
So, I was, like, okay.

311
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:44,240
We can... We can make this work.

312
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,280
Um, also, by the way, Juan George, thank you for that magenta soup.

313
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:48,900
Thank you, thank you.

314
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,440
Welcome back, overqualified beto2.

315
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:52,820
Last week is my birthday.

316
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,120
Can you give me a happy birthday?

317
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,240
Also, how about lower your bet?

318
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:57,300
Thank you, magenta soup.

319
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:58,860
Thank you, thank you.

320
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,620
Happy birthday to you.

321
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:02,360
Happy birthday to you.

322
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,520
Happy birthday, dear Juan George.

323
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,300
Say happy birthday to you.

324
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,700
Yeah, happy birthday!

325
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:14,760
Um, I am not gonna sacrifice my sleeping arrangements.

326
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:20,240
Just so he can... He has... By the way, I also bought two more beds for him.

327
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:23,720
Because one in my office and one next to my bed.

328
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:27,760
So, like, he does not need the privilege of sleeping on my bed.

329
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:32,880
Like... So, it's fine.

330
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:38,280
I'd rather he doesn't break... I'd rather he doesn't break his back.

331
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,700
So, like, I'd rather do that.

332
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:42,260
Like...

333
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:47,320
Um... Anyway... Oh, what was I talking about before my mind got, like, everywhere?

334
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:50,120
Oh... Oh, so, Mr. Sam, thank you for the Akasupa.

335
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:50,660
Thank you.

336
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:51,300
Thank you.

337
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:54,520
Dad has been a trooper and I hope this Akasupa finds his way to him.

338
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:58,300
May dad be blessed with the best food he can get and all the quality time.

339
00:15:58,620 --> 00:15:59,600
With the babysitter.

340
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:00,740
Thank you for the Akasupa.

341
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,180
Thank you.

342
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:01,880
Thank you.

343
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:05,960
Um... I have a funny story about the dog sitter.

344
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,600
Uh... But let me write this down so I can remember.

345
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,980
Tell story about dogs... Oh, yeah!

346
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,040
The harness.

347
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:20,780
So... Um... But, obviously, um... I didn't want to put the collar... Like, you know, just the collar and leash on his neck.

348
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:24,440
Um... Because, obviously, he just... He's still recovering.

349
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:27,520
He's going through, like, uh... He can't really run.

350
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:30,120
He does, like, little hops instead of actually running.

351
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:34,340
Um... And he can't... When he walks, it's, like, slanted.

352
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:40,680
So, like, he can't walk in a straight line because he's still, like, you know, recovering from his back surgery.

353
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,240
Um... And...

354
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:48,160
So, um... What I do is that I go no leash and just let him walk to the dog park.

355
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:52,780
Um... Because, like, uh... He knows how to go there.

356
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:54,340
He knows how to... Yeah, he drifts now.

357
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,120
So, he knows how to get to the dog park.

358
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:58,300
And, like... So, he... I just let him walk over there.

359
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,260
And, um...

360
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:09,300
So, this dog park... Um... This dog park... There's this giant white dog that sometimes shows up at this dog park.

361
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:15,860
And, um... The thing is... He's not afraid... I talked about it in the members before.

362
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:22,220
He does... He doesn't, like... He's not afraid of this white... Giant white dog there.

363
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:29,900
Um... Instead... Um... He rolls over... And becomes a submissive little...

364
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:30,440
A little bitch.

365
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:38,960
And... And... And... And... The thing is... He doesn't do that to any other dog.

366
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:45,460
It's... And then... That giant white... Dog... Fucking... Just licks his ear.

367
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,340
And it's... It's so weird.

368
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:56,120
It's... Is that like... And he... It's not like he, like... The white dog approaches him.

369
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:56,720
No.

370
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,880
He... Walks over to the... And he...

371
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,100
He, like... Is so excited, too.

372
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,560
I'm like... Is this... Like... Okay.

373
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:12,720
I'll show you... Like... This is what he... This is... He rolls over fully on his back.

374
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:13,520
He's like... Yes.

375
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:14,840
Lick me.

376
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,800
Oh my god.

377
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,560
He's... Freaky.

378
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,520
He's like... Yes.

379
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,260
Lick me.

380
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,780
And I'm... I... I don't know what to do.

381
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:26,400
I...

382
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,440
That... What a freak.

383
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:37,400
And... So... But he likes it even more... When the giant white dog... Licks his ears.

384
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:47,740
And... I think... Ahem... He's... Freakier than us.

385
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:54,880
And... And then like... You know... When... The other dog... Walks away... He obviously... He's like... No.

386
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:55,780
Don't leave!

387
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:56,300
He... Like...

388
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:02,400
He gets back and then he like runs up to the other dog and is like, please!

389
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,880
And then he like rolls back on his stomach and is like, lick me!

390
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,880
Or me, oh freak.

391
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:17,200
And so like, I don't know, I think it's weird.

392
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:24,000
And then the owner was like, I'm sorry, my dog really loves licking ears for some reason.

393
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:30,040
And I'm like, yeah, yeah, my dog is apparently really into that too.

394
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:42,140
So that's like status update on what he's going through right now.

395
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:44,860
He's just like me.

396
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:47,920
So I'll give you a cute picture of him.

397
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,040
This is like, he's like at my bedroom right now sleeping.

398
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:56,160
I mean, he usually just sleeps, but there he is.

399
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,660
Tucked in the corner.

400
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,320
Look, he also can tuck himself.

401
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:03,540
Since he's a wiener dog, they sound like a great match.

402
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,340
Don't can't shame them.

403
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,660
Lexi, thank you for the super chat.

404
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,580
Thank you, thank you.

405
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:09,860
There he is.

406
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:11,920
He tucked himself to sleep, by the way, guys.

407
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:14,860
Since like, wiener dogs love to burrow.

408
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:18,300
So they know how to like tuck themselves in.

409
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,800
And then sometimes he sleeps like a person and it's a little weird.

410
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,720
But like, I let him do his thing.

411
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,260
Uh, oh, he's so tiny.

412
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,060
Okay.

413
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:29,660
Okay, so I...

414
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,260
So, okay, the dog sitter story.

415
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,720
Okay, so...

416
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:38,800
Um, the dog sitter sent me a video of like him...

417
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,060
Um, recovering.

418
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,680
And then...

419
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,120
Wait, okay.

420
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,120
I'm gonna...

421
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:45,840
Give me a sec.

422
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:46,340
Let me...

423
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:47,540
I'm gonna like not move for a sec.

424
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:48,840
Let me send this video to myself.

425
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:50,580
Um, so I can show it to you guys.

426
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,280
Because it was a fucking...

427
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,780
I was like, what the fuck?

428
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:58,880
My dog says like, oh yeah, I forgot to send you this...

429
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,880
Uh, I forgot to send you this video.

430
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:02,060
Dino was funny.

431
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,140
It was pretty funny though.

432
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:04,920
It was...

433
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,480
It was pretty funny.

434
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,540
But let me...

435
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:08,360
Let me save it.

436
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:11,260
Let me save this and send it over to myself real quick.

437
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:12,920
So I can show it to you guys.

438
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,440
Um, but the thing is...

439
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,620
She put...

440
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,260
Um, okay, so I'm muting...

441
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,480
I'm gonna like...

442
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:19,880
I...

443
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,680
Um, the music is not on.

444
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:26,020
But like, she put a song over this video.

445
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,620
And I was like...

446
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:33,700
The song choice for the video was like...

447
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,180
It was...

448
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:35,740
I...

449
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:37,280
I just did not expect it.

450
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,640
I did not expect the song that...

451
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:40,520
I...

452
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,520
I need to remember what it was.

453
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:42,660
Let me see if I can find it.

454
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:44,100
Alright, give me a sec, guys.

455
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:47,920
I'm gonna say I can find this particular song that, uh...

456
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,360
My dog sitter used.

457
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,440
Cause I was honestly...

458
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,020
I was not expecting this particular song.

459
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,040
Let me see...

460
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:00,160

Um...

00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:05,860
Alright, let me see what song this is.

466
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:06,840
It was...

467
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:08,700
Oh my god.

468
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:09,460
What was it?

469
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:11,340
Oh, is it...

470
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:11,980
Oh, wait.

471
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:12,400
Okay.

472
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:13,460
Give me a...

473
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:13,960
I'm sorry.

474
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:14,980
Give me a sec, guys.

475
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,260
I need to find this.

476
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,900
I need to figure out what song this is.

477
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:22,400
Oh my god.

478
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,400
Wait, it's not playing.

479
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:23,900
No!

480
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,120
Okay, wait.

481
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,840
I'm not gonna move for a sec.

482
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:27,920
I know how to find it.

483
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,320
Sorry, a little intermission.

484
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:30,780
Guys, a little...

485
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:32,080
A little...

486
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,340
A little inter...

487
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:34,400
This is very...

488
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,180
No, you don't understand.

489
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,860
This is very important.

490
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,440
Okay, let me see.

491
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:42,600
I, like, removed the song for it.

492
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:45,320
So that's why, like, you don't hear it when I put it on.

493
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,600
But I need a no.

494
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:47,880
Okay, it's...

495
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,100
Bitch, I'm cute.

496
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:50,540
So, like...

497
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:57,900
The song that was playing on this particular video...

498
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,600
Was, bitch, I'm cute.

499
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,500
And I was like, what the fuck?

500
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:05,760
Why was this playing?

501
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:07,780
So...

502
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:08,520
Okay, wait.

503
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:10,260
Um...

504
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,920
Okay, so...

505
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,560
Um...

506
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:17,880
So...

507
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,880
This was...

508
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,220
This was the song that was...

509
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:22,380
They...

510
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,820
This was like...

511
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:27,300
This was, like, what they sent me.

512
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,880
And then the song was...

513
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,620
Bitch, I'm cute.

514
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,400
So...

515
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,760
They were like...

516
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,520
And he's just licking...

517
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:40,240
He's just licking a cat of alcohol.

518
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,160
I was like...

519
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,540
What the fuck?

520
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,700
And he's just licking the cat.

521
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,760
I was like, what is he doing?

522
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:54,080
But, like, the BGM of that video was bitch, I'm cute.

523
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:58,760
And I was like, by the way, the dog sitter...

524
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,360
Okay, let me see if it's this song.

525
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:01,280
I'm gonna see.

526
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,040
Okay.

527
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:05,860
This was the song that was playing.

528
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:06,920
I'll send it to you guys.

529
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:07,660
This...

530
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:12,780
This was the song that was playing while I was watching that video.

531
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:13,720
And...

532
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:16,960
And...

533
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:17,480
And...

534
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,180
And...

535
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:19,440
I was like, what the...

536
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:26,440
And by the way, the dog sitter is like a 50-year-old mom.

537
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:40,360
The dog sitter is like a 50-year-old mom with two teenagers.

538
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,380
And obviously, the husband is there, too.

539
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,360
With, like...

540
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,660
With two teenagers.

541
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:46,780
And...

542
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,980
So, I just not...

543
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:52,820
I was not expecting it at all.

544
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:54,780
Um...

545
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:55,640
Uh, Sportball.

546
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,740
Thank you for the super chat.

547
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:57,120
Thank you.

548
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:57,640
Thank you.

549
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,580
Doki telling funny stories while laughing.

550
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,780
Missed sentences like the Maple Leafs in Game 7.

551
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,580
They can't finish worth the time.

552
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:05,140
Thank you for the super chat.

553
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:05,800
Thank you.

554
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:06,600
Thank you.

555
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,420
She's just trying to be a hip mom.

556
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,280
I...

557
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,020
I guess.

558
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,820
I fucking...

559
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:14,340
I fucking guess.

560
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:17,000
She's trying to be cool for her children.

561
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:17,480
You know?

562
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,420
For her kids.

563
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:20,280
Um...

564
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:23,280
Oh, she's a cool mom.

565
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:25,900
Um...

566
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:27,400
Um...

567
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:31,400
But yeah, I wanted to, like, give you guys a little dad update.

568
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,920
Oh, it was a little dad update.

569
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:34,560
It was, like, a 30-minute dad update.

570
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:36,920
I was a little idiot.

571
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,220
Uh, but yes.

572
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:41,060
I have to walk dad three times a day now.

573
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,940
And he has, like, a strict routine.

574
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:43,620
Well, he doesn't...

575
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:44,600
Okay, that's a lie.

576
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:45,340
It's not strict.

577
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:46,300
It's not even...

578
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:47,820
Like, it's not a strict routine.

579
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:51,660
It's, like, he has a routine now that I have to keep track of.

580
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:57,900
And if I don't follow it, he'll just walk over there and, like, be like...

581
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,400
Be like, wake up!

582
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,240
I need feed time!

583
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,400
Also, but, like, he's given up morning feed time.

584
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:07,700
Because the dog sitters...

585
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:11,120
The dog sitters used to feed him at 8.30 in the morning.

586
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,800
And, obviously, that's not gonna happen.

587
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,920
That's never gonna happen on my side.

588
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:25,180
So, like, he has tried...

589
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:26,780
Uh...

590
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:29,160
He's tried several times.

591
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,480
Like, I think, like, two to three times.

592
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,780
Uh, to, like, wake me up.

593
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,360
Um, at 8.30 in the morning.

594
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,740
Sometimes 9, you know?

595
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,880
He gives me, like, a little 30-minute breather.

596
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,860
But, I just don't wake up.

597
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:44,920
And he's, like...

598
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:49,160
What I've noticed is that he has definitely given up.

599
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:52,080
I'm trying to...

600
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,080
He has...

601
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:57,340
He has given up trying to wake me up that early.

602
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:59,120
Because when I don't get up...

603
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,640
Like, I acknowledge...

604
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,780
The thing is...

605
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:06,080
I, like, acknowledge that he wants to eat at 8.30.

606
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,620
But I don't get out of my bed.

607
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:09,980
So, like...

608
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:11,180
He'll be, like...

609
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:14,280
Like, you know, really loud.

610
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,080
And then...

611
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:15,860
I, like...

612
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:17,380
Obviously, I look at him.

613
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,620
And he's, like...

614
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,080
And then I, like...

615
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,180
And then he realized...

616
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,640
I'm not getting up.

617
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,060
So, he just walks back to his bed.

618
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:27,540
And just goes back to sleep.

619
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:28,460
And I'm, like...

620
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:29,940
That's right, you whore.

621
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:31,220
You eat...

622
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:34,060
You eat when I wake up.

623
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:41,040
We are readjusting your schedule.

624
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:45,820
Toki, that's messed up.

625
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:46,480
Okay.

626
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,640
I feed him at 10.30 in the morning.

627
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:52,860
That's just two hours later, chat.

628
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:57,240
It's not like I'm starving him for the rest of the day.

629
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:01,400
I just need two more hours of sleep.

630
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,800
Like, I eat at 10.

631
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:06,680
That's late.

632
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:10,500
You eat on my...

633
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,180
It's two hours.

634
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:16,840
It's not like I'm fucking dragging it out to 12.

635
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,220
Oh, my God.

636
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:21,480
Poister, he eats wet food.

637
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:40,600
Poister, by the way, he fucking loves wet food so much that, like, when I used to feed him dry food, he, like, waits until, like, you know, I just scoop the food and then, and then put it in his, um, you know, in his bowl.

638
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:45,000
But he waits for me to, like, finish putting things, putting in the bowl.

639
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:49,980
That, for wet food, is like, gimme, gimme, gimme.

640
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:56,560
I have to, like, hold him off while I'm pouring food in his bowl.

641
00:28:56,740 --> 00:29:01,760
Because he just, when I don't, he, like, sucks his head into the can.

642
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,020
I don't know.

643
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,200
He's, like, he's fucking ready.

644
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:21,040
Like, I have to literally use my other hand to hold him while he's, like, pushing against my hand, and, like, like, pushing against it and, like, trying to run towards the bowl while he's already at the bowl.

645
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:26,580
Like, it's because you're starving him, Doki.

646
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:27,740
Oh, yeah.

647
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:32,580
My giant-ass cat of white food and I'm starving him.

648
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:38,320
That, he's gonna recall this as trauma.

649
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:45,400
So, I have to, like, hold him and just pour, just pour the can and then, like, let him go.

650
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:47,940
Because the thing is, I can't give him the full can.

651
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,960
I have to do, like, um, no, I said wet food.

652
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:57,720
I have to, like, um, pour half and then, like, save the other half for, like, dinner.

653
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,460
Because he can't eat the full can.

654
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:01,220
Um, he is going...

655
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:04,140
He is going to die of hunger, Doki.

656
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,780
How dare you?

657
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:08,220
Dad will remember this.

658
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,360
It's the good shit.

659
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:24,480
But, yeah, that's basically the life update of, uh, dad so far.

660
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:26,420
Um, I am adjusting.

661
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:28,060
He's already adjusted.

662
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,800
He's having the time.

663
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:36,080
You know, I would say that he's technically living a better fucking life.

664
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,000
Because of all the shit that's going through.

665
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,760
Because now he's even more spoiled.

666
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:51,000
He has so much more to his life now.

667
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:54,220
Um, the wet food can't get more.

668
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,800
Yes, it can!

669
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:56,600
What?

670
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:57,920
I...

671
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:02,200
Papa Smurfs, thank you for the super chat.

672
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:03,500
Thank you, thank you.

673
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,240
Um, how much more...

674
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,060
You know what?

675
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:12,860
I even Amazon ordered, like, a little playpen for him.

676
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:14,980
Because I was told we had to keep him.

677
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,500
Like, I...

678
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:20,920
Um, the dogs are telling me that he was getting more active and running around and stuff.

679
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,440
So I was like, oh shit, okay.

680
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:23,020
So I...

681
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:26,260
Amazon ordered those little, like, playpen gates.

682
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:28,820
So he can be, like, restrained in one area.

683
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:30,220
Like, you know, prison.

684
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,140
Um...

685
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,000
A little doggy prison for him.

686
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,020
So he won't...

687
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:35,560
I was scared.

688
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:38,020
Because I didn't want him to, like, run around.

689
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:40,500
And then I realized, like...

690
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:40,740
Huh.

691
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:41,720
Who am I kidding?

692
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:43,780
He doesn't give a fuck when I'm here.

693
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:44,580
He just sleeps.

694
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:45,300
I...

695
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:53,360
I guess he's, like, no family and no life.

696
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:54,600
So he, like...

697
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:58,660
All he does, like, you know, when I work is he just sleeps, like, in his bed.

698
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,200
So I was like, oh my god.

699
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:03,480
So, literally, I have this giant box.

700
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,480
Like, the box with, like, no sitter.

701
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,080
It's EP time.

702
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:08,980
Like...

703
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:11,420
So...

704
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:13,080
Um...

705
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,060
Um...

706
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:14,880
So...

707
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,920
Basically, he's surprised right now.

708
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,440
Anyway.

709
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:20,260
Anyway.

710
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,100
Um...

711
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:21,920
So...

712
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:22,300
Uh...

713
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:25,680
I have this giant box sitting outside my door.

714
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,700
But I live in an apartment.

715
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:29,240
So, like, nobody steals, um...

716
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:29,680
In my...

717
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,200
On my floor.

718
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:30,960
Um...

719
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,340
The special thing about it is that, um...

720
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:35,420
Our keys are...

721
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:37,560
Are, like, hobs or whatever the fuck is called.

722
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,560
The things that goes beep.

723
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,920
And then you take the elevator.

724
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:42,680
It's, like, restricted to my floor only.

725
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:43,420
So...

726
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:47,460
Only people living on my floor can access, like...

727
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:48,680
Can access my floor.

728
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:50,100
So, like...

729
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:50,600
Um...

730
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,060
The fob.

731
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:51,740
Yeah, the fob.

732
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:52,500
So...

733
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,260
Um...

734
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:57,780
So I have this giant box of the doggie prison jail.

735
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,500
Just outside my door.

736
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:00,860
Because it's fucking huge.

737
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:01,940
It's, like, as tall as me.

738
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:02,840
Like, the box thing.

739
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:03,400
Um...

740
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,600
It's almost as tall as me.

741
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:06,420
So, like, I realized...

742
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:07,220
Dad...

743
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,780
Wasn't gonna fucking move.

744
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:10,300
Or, like, do anything.

745
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:14,080
So I've just been letting it sit outside for a week plus now.

746
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:14,580
I...

747
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:16,260
Because I was, like...

748
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,820
I don't wanna bring it inside.

749
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:19,320
It's so fucking big.

750
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,060
Like...

751
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:21,220
And I live alone.

752
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:23,660
So it's been sitting outside for a week now.

753
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:24,560
Because, like...

754
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:24,960
He's...

755
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,280
I'm not gonna unpack it.

756
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:26,980
Obviously.

757
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,100
Um...

758
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:28,580
But, like...

759
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:29,260
So, like...

760
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:29,980
Because I was, like...

761
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:30,780
Oh, he's just sleeping.

762
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:31,280
So, like...

763
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:31,860
I'll just put it...

764
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:32,320
I'll just...

765
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,960
I'll bring it in when I have to.

766
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,120
No, I'm not gonna return it.

767
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:44,000
Because what if I need it later, guys?

768
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:48,300
What if he needs to go to doggy jail later?

769
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:49,660
Like, I don't know that.

770
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:52,440
Like...

771
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:53,700
Um...

772
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,260
Andy, thank you for the super chat.

773
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:56,260
Thank you, thank you.

774
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:58,300
Turned 40 on Wednesday last week.

775
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:00,260
Can this old man get a happy birthday?

776
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,260
Of course you can!

777
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,140
Happy birthday to you.

778
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,120
Happy birthday to you.

779
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,980
Happy birthday, dear Andy.

780
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:11,460
Happy birthday to you.

781
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:11,900
Yeah!

782
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:12,840
Happy birthday!

783
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:13,760
Yeah!

784
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,640
I'm not a hoarder, guys.

785
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,280
I might have, like...

786
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,500
Seven plus boxes I have never unpacked.

787
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,300
But I am not a hoarder.

788
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:26,200
What else?

789
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:26,560
Okay.

790
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,060
Enough about that update.

791
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:30,460
What did I do in the last week?

792
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:31,660
Okay, so...

793
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,540
I know a lot of you guys are going through, like...

794
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,240
We're, um...

795
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:36,900
Getting desperate.

796
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:38,000
Um...

797
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,160
And because, obviously, like, you know...

798
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:42,980
Usually when I take a break, I wouldn't be gone for that long.

799
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:43,980
And I would, you know...

800
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:47,280
Do, like, a gorilla stream in between every so often.

801
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,600
But, obviously, I didn't.

802
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,400
Um...

803
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,280
I took that break to touch grass.

804
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:51,860
Yes!

805
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:55,620
I actually touched grass, um...

806
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:56,480
For...

807
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,840
Not the first time.

808
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:59,440
And I didn't get sick.

809
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:00,600
Yet.

810
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,640
Knock on wood.

811
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:03,580
I...

812
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:06,400
So...

813
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,200
I...

814
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,000
Actually, I went to...

815
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:09,900
I went to some farm...

816
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,180
I went to the farmer's market.

817
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:12,820
I went to a night market.

818
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:14,280
And, um...

819
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,760
I actually, um...

820
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,100
Asked a few of my friends.

821
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:19,100
Uh...

822
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:21,320
They wanted to do an escape room together.

823
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,560
And I also did...

824
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:24,140
Yes, guys.

825
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:25,720
I have friends outside...

826
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,860
I have friends outside of the internet.

827
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:31,380
I might not have, like, talked to some of them for, like, years.

828
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,920
So, it was a little weird.

829
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:33,740
Where I was like...

830
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:36,720
Hey, it's been a long time...

831
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,000
Since we, like...

832
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,120
Interacted.

833
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:40,360
Um...

834
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:40,840
Hey...

835
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,400
Hi.

836
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,520
You wanna do an escape room together?

837
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,780
I was like...

838
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:49,800
I was like...

839
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:50,160
Hey.

840
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:51,700
You wanna...

841
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,640
You wanna do an escape room?

842
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:56,180
We haven't talked in a long time.

843
00:35:56,980 --> 00:36:00,020
But you wanna do an escape room?

844
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:00,940
I...

845
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:04,580
I just...

846
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:07,320
I wanted to do an escape room, okay?

847
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:08,480
I just wanted...

848
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:11,720
I did not do, like, rent a friend or some shit.

849
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:12,380
I have...

850
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:14,300
I have friends in real life.

851
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:16,900
I just haven't talked to them in maybe years.

852
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:17,900
But, like...

853
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:18,720
We...

854
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,680
We talked to each other after...

855
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,980
I did not escape the room.

856
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:24,100
I...

857
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:24,660
Um...

858
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:25,700
We failed...

859
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:26,500
Spetag...

860
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,160
We fucking...

861
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,320
We fucking...

862
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,680
Failed in the escape room.

863
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:34,560
Um...

864
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:35,880
Um...

865
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:36,660
Uh...

866
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:37,440
So, like...

867
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,660
Okay, by the way...

868
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:39,880
I would like you to know...

869
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:40,580
That, like...

870
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:41,720
We were, like...

871
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:42,260
Can we...

872
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:43,560
Me and my friends were, like...

873
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,080
We wanna do the easiest one.

874
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,180
And then...

875
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:46,720
Um...

876
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,100
And then the lady was, like...

877
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:49,000
There's this room.

878
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:49,920
And then...

879
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:50,580
I was, like...

880
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:50,860
Cool.

881
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,620
What is the success rate?

882
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:54,260
And then she was, like...

883
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:56,640
That's a 23% success rate.

884
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:57,420
And I...

885
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:02,580
So, I was, like...

886
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:03,640
Oh, cool.

887
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:04,400
Okay.

888
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:05,920
I was, like...

889
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,220
What?

890
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:08,740
What do you mean a 20?

891
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:11,200
That's your easiest one?

892
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:14,500
How the fuck was that the easiest?

893
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:15,900
Um...

894
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:16,780
There were three...

895
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:18,280
By the way, there was, like, three of us.

896
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,220
So...

897
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:21,040
The easiest one.

898
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,200
By the way...

899
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,600
I wasn't the one...

900
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,400
That fucked us over...

901
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,960
In the escape room.

902
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:27,960
Um...

903
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,980
We put one person...

904
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:31,580
One of the person was in charge...

905
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:33,840
Of cracking this specific puzzle.

906
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,900
Because each of us were, like...

907
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:36,960
Doing specific puzzles.

908
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,100
Me and my other...

909
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,260
Me and a friend...

910
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:40,580
Okay, we'll do friend A and friend B.

911
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:41,780
Me and friend A...

912
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:43,260
We figured out our puzzles.

913
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:44,440
Friend B...

914
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,980
For some fucking reason...

915
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:47,320
Was seeking forever...

916
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,720
In puzzle number three.

917
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:50,080
So, we were, like...

918
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,760
What the fuck is going on?

919
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:53,940
And they're, like...

920
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:54,580
I don't understand.

921
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,440
This is the right password.

922
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:57,520
And I was, like...

923
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,840
Okay, input the password.

924
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:00,280
And then she, like...

925
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,640
Inputed a password...

926
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,240
And then pressed the bell button.

927
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:04,180
I was, like...

928
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:05,720
What the fuck are you doing?

929
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:06,740
And she was, like...

930
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:07,000
I don't...

931
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,240
It's the bell button.

932
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:08,740
I was, like...

933
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:10,820
No, it's the fucking pound key.

934
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:11,900
You fucking idiot.

935
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:12,560
I was, like...

936
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:15,200
Have you not pressed codes before?

937
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:21,940
I was like, it's the pound key!

938
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,620
Have you never have a password?

939
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:30,160
Have you never entered a fucking gate code?

940
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:33,420
So she was like, it's me, I'm friendly.

941
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:36,100
No, no, I was the one!

942
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,920
I was like, what's the code?

943
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:39,440
And she was like, blah, blah, blah.

944
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,420
And I was like, beep, beep, beep, pound.

945
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,300
And then it unlocked.

946
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,080
Sorry, I meant the hashtag.

947
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:55,260
Fucking sorry, I meant hashtag.

948
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,260
The hashtag thing.

949
00:38:57,740 --> 00:39:01,520
And then so, so I was, I obviously, I was like, oh my god.

950
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:04,480
She was literally stuck on that puzzle for so fucking long.

951
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,760
Checking it, double checking it, triple checking it.

952
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:12,140
And then I was like, I was like, she's like, no, this is the correct one.

953
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,100
I was like, are you sure?

954
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:14,760
She's like, yeah, but it won't work.

955
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:17,540
And then I, we like lost 20 minutes.

956
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:21,740
We, we lost, we lost 20.

957
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,780
And then I asked the lady.

958
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:26,700
I was like, how close were we?

959
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:28,940
How fucking close were we?

960
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:32,260
And she was like, you had three puzzles left.

961
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:36,840
I was like, I fucking, the stupid pound key.

962
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:57,160
This is why I had a 20% win rate.

963
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,240
Lord Kurosis.

964
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:00,940
Thank you for the super chat.

965
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:01,620
Thank you.

966
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:02,480
Thank you.

967
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:06,720
I would like you to know, I did all my shit correctly.

968
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:11,420
I, I don't know.

969
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:13,700
It was apparently the easiest one.

970
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:19,080
I was like, I would like the easiest escape room, please, for the three of us.

971
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,720
And then she was like, oh, we'll do this one then.

972
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,580
And I'm like, how's success rate?

973
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:25,260
23%.

974
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:30,040
It's a team.

975
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,240
I don't know.

976
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:32,380
She was stupid.

977
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,020
Also, if you're watching this, I'm sorry.

978
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:41,000
But you know, you fucked up.

979
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:45,080
If you're watching this right now, you know, you fucking fucked up.

980
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:47,320
We told you, you fucked it up.

981
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:54,040
All two of us told you were the reason why we didn't make that escape room.

982
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,940
You know that we blame you.

983
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:58,480
We got two kids.

984
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:02,100
The call.

985
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:10,580
All two of us blame friend B.

986
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,960
But yeah, no, we didn't, we didn't success.

987
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:26,040
That's, you know, I haven't, by the way, I haven't done a, an escape room for like years now.

988
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:27,860
So like, that's why I just, I don't know.

989
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:29,160
I was like, what do I want to do?

990
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:31,980
So I was just Googling like things to do in the city.

991
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:41,320
And it was like, it was literally like, there was like laser tag and like the virtual, like reality shooters and stuff like that.

992
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:45,620
And then I saw, and then apparently there was like a ton of escape rooms around the city.

993
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:48,240
And then I was like, I'm going to do escape room.

994
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:52,840
I was like, I'm going to do it.

995
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:55,020
I'm going to do a fucking escape room.

996
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:57,180
I haven't done that shit in years.

997
00:41:57,740 --> 00:41:59,100
And that's thank you for the super chat.

998
00:41:59,260 --> 00:41:59,520
Thank you.

999
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:00,220
Thank you.

1000
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,980
You can try again in five years.

1001
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:06,440
It takes in the five years it takes to talk to your friends again.

1002
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:08,120
Thank you for the super chat.

1003
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:08,600
Thank you.

1004
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:09,260
Thank you.

1005
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:10,040
Wings.

1006
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,080
Thank you for the super chat.

1007
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:11,460
Thank you.

1008
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:12,080
Thank you.

1009
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:17,420
Imagine going back and find out that Friend B bumped that failure rate by a whole 2%.

1010
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:19,280
Thank you for the super chat.

1011
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:19,840
Thank you.

1012
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:20,600
Thank you.

1013
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:23,240
Affiliant, thank you for the magenta soup.

1014
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:23,940
Thank you.

1015
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:24,540
Thank you.

1016
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:27,680
Really glad you've been having a great time with friends while you're away.

1017
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:28,740
Welcome back, Doki.

1018
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:29,560
Thank you.

1019
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:30,020
Yeah.

1020
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:34,280
It was just really fun, like, just reconnecting with some of my older friends and everything.

1021
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,740
We might have a...

1022
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:39,600
Guys, thank you for the magenta soup.

1023
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:40,400
Thank you.

1024
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,000
Thank you.

1025
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,780
I don't like female friend groups.

1026
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:44,600
Too much drama.

1027
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:45,400
The drama.

1028
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:48,780
The great escape room drama.

1029
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:59,180
And I was the one that dragged my friends into the escape room just so I could yell at them.

1030
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:02,700
The escape room incident.

1031
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:13,600
The escape room situation is crazy.

1032
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,740
Doki had friends.

1033
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:20,720
But yeah, I went to, like...

1034
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,560
Oh, I even watched Thunderbolts.

1035
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:23,960
I haven't been in a...

1036
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:28,480
I wanted to watch Minecraft movie, but I wanted to go to a VIP theater.

1037
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:34,000
So, the difference between a normal theater and a VIP theater is that you can drink.

1038
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:40,880
In the VIP theater, you can drink.

1039
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:45,320
And I really wanted to drink while watching a dumb movie.

1040
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:52,640
So, the only movies that were playing was, like, Thunderbolt and, like, the others I don't fucking care.

1041
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:55,940
So, I was like, alright, the only difference is the alcohol.

1042
00:43:56,220 --> 00:44:01,940
So, I was like, well, I want to watch a stupid fucking movie and, like, a cinema.

1043
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:04,480
Because I haven't been in a cinema in a while now.

1044
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:06,160
So, I was like, I'm gonna...

1045
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:09,860
I'm gonna drink and watch a Thunderbolt.

1046
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:18,080
And the thing is, I haven't, like, um...

1047
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:22,800
I haven't watched Marvel films in a long-ass fucking time.

1048
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:25,940
I was also, like, ten minutes late.

1049
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,440
I was not pre-drinking, by the way.

1050
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:30,260
I was just, like, ten...

1051
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:30,880
I was just...

1052
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:33,140
I didn't take into account of, like, time.

1053
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:35,420
So, I was also, like, ten minutes late.

1054
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:37,380
So, I missed, like, the first ten minutes.

1055
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:41,120
And I, like, almost, like, going in, it was, like, in a fucking weird scene.

1056
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:44,880
Where, like, I don't know, Yolana or whatever.

1057
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:48,300
Like, I didn't even realize, like, Black Widow has a fucking sister.

1058
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:49,960
Okay, this was my issue.

1059
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:53,320
I had no idea who any of those characters were.

1060
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:54,760
I... except for Bucky.

1061
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:55,660
I...

1062
00:44:57,080 --> 00:45:03,420
I didn't even watch any movies where Bucky was in the film.

1063
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:05,100
Other than, like, what is it?

1064
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:05,600
Endgame.

1065
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:09,580
Endgame was, like, the only movie I watched with Bucky in there.

1066
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:10,800
And then, like...

1067
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:15,840
And, like, so majority of my context about Bucky was literally Marvel Rivals.

1068
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:21,500
So, like, I had zero idea who any of these characters were for Thunderbolts.

1069
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:28,320
And, like, apparently, a lot of them appeared in, like, TV shows.

1070
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:31,840
Like, Disney Plus TV show spin-offs.

1071
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:33,360
Other movies.

1072
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:36,080
And, like, all the other shit.

1073
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:37,120
And I was like...

1074
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:39,880
Because I was like, who the fuck are all these people?

1075
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:41,400
I was so confused.

1076
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:46,980
But, so, like...

1077
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:47,780
And then there was...

1078
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:49,860
Okay, I'll give you guys a spoiler alert.

1079
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:54,620
Because, like, there was a lady on the poster with a cool-ass fucking mask design.

1080
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:55,780
Um...

1081
00:45:55,780 --> 00:45:57,040
Okay, huge spoiler alert.

1082
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:00,540
I thought she was gonna be an important character.

1083
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:02,600
Part of the Thunderbolts movie.

1084
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:06,040
Only because she was in, like, all the posters.

1085
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:10,200
But she literally dies in the first 15 minutes.

1086
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:10,900
I...

1087
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:17,260
I was like...

1088
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:18,280
Is she dead?

1089
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:21,060
Like, in my head, I was like...

1090
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:21,680
Is she...

1091
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:22,360
Is she...

1092
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:23,340
I was like...

1093
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:24,140
That's it?

1094
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:26,520
I was like...

1095
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:29,400
I thought she would be more important.

1096
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:31,800
She lives in all the posters.

1097
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:39,400
She did not complete her task.

1098
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:40,060
Yeah.

1099
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:41,480
But, like...

1100
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:45,380
Apparently, she was an important character in, like, one of the movies.

1101
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:46,700
So...

1102
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:48,880
So...

1103
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:49,980
So...

1104
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:50,720
So I was so...

1105
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:52,360
I was so confused.

1106
00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:54,420
Um...

1107
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:54,820
But, yeah.

1108
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:56,140
They all, like...

1109
00:46:56,140 --> 00:46:56,420
Yeah.

1110
00:46:56,420 --> 00:46:58,740
She did not complete the task.

1111
00:46:58,980 --> 00:46:59,560
Apparently.

1112
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:04,240
So, um...

1113
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:07,120
I was very confused in the beginning of the movie.

1114
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:12,720
Just because they were introducing, like, five plus characters that I didn't know existed in the franchise.

1115
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:17,120
But they all showed up in different parts of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

1116
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:18,840
And obviously...

1117
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:23,460
Obviously, in the end, I knew who they were because the movie spent a lot of time building them up.

1118
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:24,340
I like Bob.

1119
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:26,300
Bob's my favorite character, honestly.

1120
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:27,520
I think he's the...

1121
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:29,520
He was the best character out of all of them.

1122
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:31,780
I don't really care much about anybody else.

1123
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,040
Bob's pretty cool.

1124
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:33,960
I like him.

1125
00:47:36,910 --> 00:47:38,730
For those who are like, who's Bob?

1126
00:47:38,990 --> 00:47:39,870
You'll find out.

1127
00:47:40,070 --> 00:47:41,270
You'll know who Bob is.

1128
00:47:41,270 --> 00:47:43,310
And you'd be like, Bob's the best.

1129
00:47:43,450 --> 00:47:44,110
He's the go.

1130
00:47:47,390 --> 00:47:48,510
I don't...

1131
00:47:48,510 --> 00:47:51,630
Also, I don't know if it's because I enjoy the movie more.

1132
00:47:51,630 --> 00:47:53,130
Because I was drunk.

1133
00:47:54,690 --> 00:48:00,210
I was definitely drunk while watching Thunderbolts.

1134
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:04,610
I ordered some fucking alcohol that had, like, vodka in it.

1135
00:48:04,710 --> 00:48:06,630
So, I was definitely drunk.

1136
00:48:06,710 --> 00:48:08,090
And I had nachos, too.

1137
00:48:08,270 --> 00:48:10,850
I ate nachos with my drink.

1138
00:48:12,110 --> 00:48:13,550
So, I don't know.

1139
00:48:13,830 --> 00:48:15,750
Personally, if you're like, was the movie good?

1140
00:48:15,850 --> 00:48:16,850
I don't know.

1141
00:48:17,090 --> 00:48:20,130
I was pretty drunk while watching the movie.

1142
00:48:20,450 --> 00:48:23,150
So, I had...

1143
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:26,730
I personally had a good time watching the film.

1144
00:48:26,930 --> 00:48:28,050
Just because...

1145
00:48:28,050 --> 00:48:30,010
But I don't know if it's whether or not.

1146
00:48:30,210 --> 00:48:31,730
The movie was good.

1147
00:48:32,050 --> 00:48:33,930
Or, like, I was just having...

1148
00:48:33,930 --> 00:48:36,250
I was just having a good time drinking while watching.

1149
00:48:41,490 --> 00:48:43,370
Bob, thank you for the super chat.

1150
00:48:43,490 --> 00:48:43,750
Thank you.

1151
00:48:43,890 --> 00:48:44,310
Thank you.

1152
00:48:44,470 --> 00:48:45,510
Gee, thanks, Doki.

1153
00:48:45,750 --> 00:48:47,710
I appreciate the show.

1154
00:48:48,710 --> 00:48:49,390
Oh, yeah.

1155
00:48:50,130 --> 00:48:50,770
Oh, yeah.

1156
00:48:50,930 --> 00:48:52,130
I thought it was funny.

1157
00:48:52,450 --> 00:48:55,910
I like how someone's like, The children got sent to the Shadow Realm.

1158
00:48:56,090 --> 00:48:59,050
Okay, so, like, Bob's special power when he...

1159
00:48:59,050 --> 00:49:00,310
When depression gets him.

1160
00:49:01,090 --> 00:49:04,410
Um, is that he can send people to their, like...

1161
00:49:04,410 --> 00:49:07,850
So, like, people thought they died when they got sent, like, in the trailer.

1162
00:49:08,330 --> 00:49:10,830
And then, like, we were like, oh my god, are they dead?

1163
00:49:12,350 --> 00:49:13,230
Are they dead?

1164
00:49:13,550 --> 00:49:15,330
But no, like, um...

1165
00:49:15,330 --> 00:49:17,270
They get sent to, like...

1166
00:49:17,270 --> 00:49:19,210
Uh, they get sent to, like, the Shadow Realm.

1167
00:49:19,430 --> 00:49:23,250
Where you relive your, like, deepest, darkest, like, regret.

1168
00:49:23,490 --> 00:49:25,710
Or, like, personal, like, trauma.

1169
00:49:25,710 --> 00:49:32,910
But I was just thinking, if you rewatch your trauma over and over and over again, then it just doesn't matter anymore.

1170
00:49:33,210 --> 00:49:33,610
Like...

1171
00:49:33,610 --> 00:49:38,970
Like, at one point, you get desensitized to the trauma.

1172
00:49:39,430 --> 00:49:42,730
So, it's like, I feel like, you know, at one point, you'll be okay.

1173
00:49:43,070 --> 00:49:46,390
Like, obviously, I'm not a licensed therapist, so...

1174
00:49:46,390 --> 00:49:50,730
But I'm like, you know how it's gonna go at that point.

1175
00:49:50,730 --> 00:49:53,730
Like, you know, um...

1176
00:49:54,250 --> 00:49:55,050
It depends...

1177
00:49:55,050 --> 00:49:55,710
Obviously, yeah.

1178
00:49:55,870 --> 00:49:57,950
It depends on the trauma itself.

1179
00:49:58,270 --> 00:50:00,190
So, I was like, yeah, exposure therapy.

1180
00:50:00,450 --> 00:50:00,850
Exactly.

1181
00:50:02,730 --> 00:50:03,130
Um...

1182
00:50:03,850 --> 00:50:06,990
Um, so, like, you know, at first, people thought, like, they died.

1183
00:50:07,010 --> 00:50:09,650
But you just get sent to your own personal hell.

1184
00:50:10,150 --> 00:50:13,070
Um, and then, so, like, in one of the scenes...

1185
00:50:13,070 --> 00:50:13,550
Spoiler.

1186
00:50:14,010 --> 00:50:17,010
In one of the scenes, a child...

1187
00:50:17,010 --> 00:50:20,710
Like, the first instance of the Shadow Realm was that...

1188
00:50:22,150 --> 00:50:22,710
He's...

1189
00:50:22,710 --> 00:50:23,010
Um...

1190
00:50:23,010 --> 00:50:24,710
A child almost dies.

1191
00:50:25,090 --> 00:50:29,290
And then, one of the Thunderbolt characters comes over and saves the child.

1192
00:50:29,590 --> 00:50:31,670
And everybody's, like, clapping, like...

1193
00:50:31,670 --> 00:50:32,090
Yay!

1194
00:50:33,350 --> 00:50:33,890
Heroes!

1195
00:50:34,650 --> 00:50:36,050
And then, the child gets snapped.

1196
00:50:36,370 --> 00:50:37,710
And then, it was like...

1197
00:50:37,710 --> 00:50:40,810
And then, she, like, flattens on the ground as a shadow.

1198
00:50:41,090 --> 00:50:42,790
And everybody's like, what the fuck?

1199
00:50:43,590 --> 00:50:44,710
Just like...

1200
00:50:44,710 --> 00:50:46,950
So, you're like, oh, shit.

1201
00:50:47,230 --> 00:50:49,390
But the thing is, she's a child.

1202
00:50:49,390 --> 00:50:53,970
So, she has, like, no trauma yet at that point.

1203
00:50:54,190 --> 00:50:56,650
Because she's still, like, a child.

1204
00:50:57,270 --> 00:50:58,630
So, like, when, like...

1205
00:50:58,630 --> 00:51:02,070
Obviously, when they, like, save everyone...

1206
00:51:02,070 --> 00:51:07,930
The child just was, like, looking around as if she's so fucking confused as to what the fuck happened.

1207
00:51:09,550 --> 00:51:10,070
Like...

1208
00:51:13,850 --> 00:51:14,370
Like...

1209
00:51:14,370 --> 00:51:14,430
Like...

1210
00:51:14,430 --> 00:51:14,890
Like...

1211
00:51:14,890 --> 00:51:15,230
Um...

1212
00:51:15,230 --> 00:51:16,830
She was just, like...

1213
00:51:16,830 --> 00:51:17,110
Oh?

1214
00:51:17,270 --> 00:51:18,610
Oh, my God.

1215
00:51:18,670 --> 00:51:19,310
What happened?

1216
00:51:21,750 --> 00:51:22,270
Um...

1217
00:51:22,270 --> 00:51:26,110
Yeah, I was, like, her being sent into the void might have been...

1218
00:51:26,110 --> 00:51:26,970
Maybe...

1219
00:51:26,970 --> 00:51:27,750
Might have been her trip.

1220
00:51:27,890 --> 00:51:29,010
But she looked fine.

1221
00:51:29,630 --> 00:51:32,030
Afterwards, when, like, they freed her from...

1222
00:51:32,030 --> 00:51:32,910
From the void.

1223
00:51:32,910 --> 00:51:34,710
Because she didn't have much trauma.

1224
00:51:36,250 --> 00:51:36,970
Um...

1225
00:51:36,970 --> 00:51:37,410
Uh...

1226
00:51:37,410 --> 00:51:37,670
But, yeah.

1227
00:51:37,930 --> 00:51:39,070
Anyway, so...

1228
00:51:40,170 --> 00:51:40,890
Um...

1229
00:51:40,890 --> 00:51:42,450
That was my experience.

1230
00:51:43,110 --> 00:51:43,830
Um...

1231
00:51:43,830 --> 00:51:46,590
That was my experience with, um...

1232
00:51:46,590 --> 00:51:47,310
Thunderbolts.

1233
00:51:47,530 --> 00:51:50,270
I would have to say that...

1234
00:51:50,270 --> 00:51:52,170
It seems like a nice movie.

1235
00:51:52,470 --> 00:51:55,510
But I have no idea if it's a good movie.

1236
00:51:55,510 --> 00:51:57,910
Just because I was not sober.

1237
00:52:00,270 --> 00:52:02,370
That's why I went to a VIP theater.

1238
00:52:02,950 --> 00:52:05,390
That was the main reason why...

1239
00:52:05,390 --> 00:52:05,830
I...

1240
00:52:05,830 --> 00:52:06,610
I...

1241
00:52:06,610 --> 00:52:07,930
I wanted...

1242
00:52:07,930 --> 00:52:10,430
I wanted to go to a VIP theater.

1243
00:52:10,550 --> 00:52:10,870
Because I...

1244
00:52:10,870 --> 00:52:11,810
I wish...

1245
00:52:11,810 --> 00:52:13,830
I wish Minecraft was still...

1246
00:52:13,830 --> 00:52:15,450
The Minecraft movie was still playing.

1247
00:52:15,630 --> 00:52:17,890
So I could, like, you know, drink while...

1248
00:52:17,890 --> 00:52:20,050
Drink while watching it.

1249
00:52:20,150 --> 00:52:22,430
But, sadly, it wasn't the theaters anymore.

1250
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:27,300
So, yeah.

1251
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:29,380
I heard everyone said it was a good movie.

1252
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:30,400
Um...

1253
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:34,040
I was like, when the fuck did Bucky became a fucking congressman?

1254
00:52:34,060 --> 00:52:34,940
I was so...

1255
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:37,120
Like, because, obviously, there's, like...

1256
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:38,980
It's built off of, like...

1257
00:52:38,980 --> 00:52:40,660
Stuff from previous movies.

1258
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:42,760
And, like, from previous series.

1259
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:44,060
It builds off of it.

1260
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:46,260
So, like, at one point, they were like...

1261
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:47,700
Bucky's now a congressman.

1262
00:52:47,820 --> 00:52:51,520
And I was like, who the fuck elected Bucky as a congressman?

1263
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:53,080
And also, like...

1264
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:54,440
The fact that...

1265
00:52:55,140 --> 00:52:55,580
Okay.

1266
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:56,600
Okay.

1267
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:57,760
I know they're, like...

1268
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:58,720
Spoiler alert.

1269
00:52:59,240 --> 00:52:59,600
Um...

1270
00:52:59,600 --> 00:52:59,680
Yeah.

1271
00:52:59,820 --> 00:53:02,180
He apparently became a congressman at one point.

1272
00:53:02,260 --> 00:53:03,280
And I was so confused.

1273
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:04,140
I...

1274
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:06,660
I...

1275
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:08,520
I...

1276
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:08,860
I...

1277
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:08,880
I...

1278
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:10,460
Apparently, he, like, went...

1279
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:14,420
He only did one term of congress before he got, like, kicked out or something.

1280
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:16,040
Or he got not re-elected.

1281
00:53:16,140 --> 00:53:17,180
I was so confused.

1282
00:53:17,420 --> 00:53:17,620
I...

1283
00:53:17,620 --> 00:53:19,000
There were so many things that happened.

1284
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:20,580
And I was like, when did any of this happen?

1285
00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:21,720
Hmm.

1286
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:23,540
Hmm.

1287
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:25,440
But...

1288
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:28,220
One thing confused me was...

1289
00:53:28,220 --> 00:53:28,720
Um...

1290
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:31,200
So, they became the New Avengers.

1291
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:31,900
Right?

1292
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:34,080
They became the New Avengers.

1293
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:35,840
But it was literally...

1294
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:37,180
I thought it was really funny.

1295
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:39,060
Because the Avengers...

1296
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:42,720
The New Avengers were literally three Captain...

1297
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:45,100
Three different versions of Captain America.

1298
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:54,360
I was like, it was three different versions of Captain America.

1299
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:57,680
I was like, that's so fucking stupid.

1300
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:07,020
Captain America was so good...

1301
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:09,280
That they just hired three of them.

1302
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:10,300
And...

1303
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:11,400
Um...

1304
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:16,780
And, like, one of them was, like, Russia's Captain America during the communist era.

1305
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:19,200
And I was like, why did we...

1306
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:23,820
Why did we bring Captain Russia to the Avengers team?

1307
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:24,680
I...

1308
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:26,100
I was so confused.

1309
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:29,160
I was like, wait, I don't...

1310
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:30,060
I feel like...

1311
00:54:30,060 --> 00:54:37,820
I feel like the citizens would not want Captain Russia to be protecting America.

1312
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:38,900
I...

1313
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:42,900
I...

1314
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:45,500
Like, I was so...

1315
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:48,300
I was so confused.

1316
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:50,060
He's...

1317
00:54:50,060 --> 00:54:52,500
Oh my God.

1318
00:54:53,860 --> 00:54:56,740
But yeah, I thought it was really...

1319
00:54:56,740 --> 00:55:02,740
I thought it was really funny that it was three different versions of...

1320
00:55:02,740 --> 00:55:04,780
Three different versions of Captain America.

1321
00:55:05,660 --> 00:55:06,340
And...

1322
00:55:09,620 --> 00:55:10,300
And...

1323
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:12,600
I just thought it was really funny.

1324
00:55:12,820 --> 00:55:13,800
Because that's why...

1325
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:15,280
Um...

1326
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:15,880
And then the...

1327
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:16,760
The...

1328
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:17,960
After credits...

1329
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:18,280
I'm sorry.

1330
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:20,320
I'm just saying a lot of spoilers right now.

1331
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:23,280
I'm saying a lot of spoilers.

1332
00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:26,540
But in the first after credits scenes...

1333
00:55:26,540 --> 00:55:27,700
They try...

1334
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:31,800
They bring up the fact that the Avengers can be copyrighted.

1335
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:34,840
And I was like...

1336
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:36,080
Because like...

1337
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:36,800
Sam Wilson...

1338
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:39,020
The other Captain America...

1339
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:40,060
You know...

1340
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:41,160
Because like...

1341
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:41,920
So now it's...

1342
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:43,520
The fourth Captain America...

1343
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:46,260
Is trying to trademark the Avengers...

1344
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:49,400
So he can build his own Avengers team.

1345
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:50,700
So it's like...

1346
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:52,500
So we're trying to figure out like...

1347
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:53,560
Which is the...

1348
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:55,380
Yeah, they're gonna get DM...

1349
00:55:55,380 --> 00:55:56,560
They're gonna get...

1350
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:58,700
The other Avengers teams...

1351
00:55:58,700 --> 00:55:59,860
Might get DMCA'd.

1352
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:00,880
DMCA'd...

1353
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:01,700
Because...

1354
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:02,940
Sam Wilson...

1355
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:04,620
The other Captain America...

1356
00:56:04,620 --> 00:56:06,440
Is trying to trademark...

1357
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:07,000
Captain of...

1358
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:07,500
Like...

1359
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:09,000
The Avengers...

1360
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,220
I wonder if he'll trademark Captain America too.

1361
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:12,780
Because technically...

1362
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:13,820
Steve Rogers...

1363
00:56:13,820 --> 00:56:15,560
Passed down the shield to him.

1364
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:18,340
So Sam...

1365
00:56:18,340 --> 00:56:20,620
Is technically the next Captain America.

1366
00:56:21,060 --> 00:56:24,660
So I'm just wondering if he's gonna trademark Captain America...

1367
00:56:24,660 --> 00:56:25,560
So that...

1368
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:27,780
They can't have three Captain Americas...

1369
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:28,700
In the other...

1370
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:33,980
It's a little confusing.

1371
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:35,360
So there's...

1372
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:35,980
In the end...

1373
00:56:35,980 --> 00:56:37,380
In the MCU...

1374
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:37,960
There's...

1375
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:38,640
Technically...

1376
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:38,900
No...

1377
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:40,640
There's five Captain Americas.

1378
00:56:41,060 --> 00:56:42,620
Because I forgot about Peggy.

1379
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:43,680
I...

1380
00:56:45,820 --> 00:56:47,300
How many more...

1381
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:48,540
Captain's can we have?

1382
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:49,960
Because I forgot...

1383
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:51,360
We have Peggy...

1384
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:53,720
As the female Captain America.

1385
00:56:54,020 --> 00:56:54,860
So in...

1386
00:56:54,860 --> 00:56:56,340
In the MCU...

1387
00:56:56,340 --> 00:56:57,860
There's five Captain Americas.

1388
00:56:58,420 --> 00:56:59,260
And they're all...

1389
00:56:59,260 --> 00:57:00,440
I don't know...

1390
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:02,740
Which one's the real Captain America anymore.

1391
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:04,680
I don't...

1392
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:05,960
I don't know...

1393
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:07,080
Who...

1394
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:09,160
Who is Captain America?

1395
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:09,900
America...

1396
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:10,940
Too many...

1397
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:11,740
Too many...

1398
00:57:11,740 --> 00:57:12,540
Captains...

1399
00:57:14,740 --> 00:57:17,780
I am the captain now...

1400
00:57:18,660 --> 00:57:19,220
I'm...

1401
00:57:22,460 --> 00:57:23,580
I'm...

1402
00:57:23,580 --> 00:57:25,540
So yeah...

1403
00:57:25,540 --> 00:57:25,820
Like...

1404
00:57:25,820 --> 00:57:26,640
There's a lot...

1405
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:26,780
I'm...

1406
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:28,640
I'm very confused...

1407
00:57:29,740 --> 00:57:30,240
I'm...

1408
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:31,260
I'm very...

1409
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:33,800
I'm so confused...

1410
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:34,480
Um...

1411
00:57:36,060 --> 00:57:37,060
Where is...

1412
00:57:37,060 --> 00:57:39,220
Where is Captain Canada?

1413
00:57:40,220 --> 00:57:40,720
Um...

1414
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:41,540
But yeah...

1415
00:57:41,540 --> 00:57:42,160
Um...

1416
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:43,060
Too many tanks.

1417
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:45,180
This team has too many tanks, guys.

1418
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:45,960
We need to...

1419
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:47,880
We need to change things up.

1420
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:48,980
Oh yeah...

1421
00:57:48,980 --> 00:57:50,160
By the way, you guys didn't know...

1422
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:51,720
This week I'm learning Elden Ring.

1423
00:57:51,860 --> 00:57:52,480
I have to learn...

1424
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:54,260
You'll find out reason why...

1425
00:57:54,260 --> 00:57:54,840
Very soon.

1426
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:57,040
I mean, some of you guys have some really good guesses.

1427
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:59,040
Obviously, I can't say why...

1428
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:00,660
But it'll be announced soon.

1429
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:03,040
So I didn't really want to start Elden Ring...

1430
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:03,860
This soon.

1431
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:07,560
But apparently, I have to learn Elden Ring...

1432
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:08,640
Mechanics...

1433
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:09,420
For this thing.

1434
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:10,560
So like...

1435
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:11,020
Um...

1436
00:58:11,830 --> 00:58:13,500
We're gonna learn Elden Ring...

1437
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:14,440
And then like...

1438
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:16,800
Just figure this out as we go...

1439
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:20,940
Um...

1440
00:58:20,940 --> 00:58:21,960
Anyway...

1441
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:22,540
Um...

1442
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:24,880
Also, we do have a special sponsor...

1443
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:25,420
On Saturday.

1444
00:58:25,860 --> 00:58:26,480
Obviously...

1445
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:28,140
I can't say what it is yet...

1446
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:29,360
Because it has been announced.

1447
00:58:29,540 --> 00:58:31,080
There's a lot of things that...

1448
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:33,340
The thing about having weekly schedules...

1449
00:58:33,340 --> 00:58:34,060
Is that...

1450
00:58:34,060 --> 00:58:35,580
I've found out...

1451
00:58:35,580 --> 00:58:36,840
That a lot of like...

1452
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:38,780
Western sponsors...

1453
00:58:38,780 --> 00:58:40,100
And Western like...

1454
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:41,620
Tournaments and stuff...

1455
00:58:41,620 --> 00:58:42,280
You...

1456
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:42,840
You...

1457
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:44,240
They do announcements...

1458
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:45,080
Really...

1459
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:46,240
Late...

1460
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:46,720
Like...

1461
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:47,900
So it's like...

1462
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:48,820
You can't...

1463
00:58:48,820 --> 00:58:50,400
Pre-announce things...

1464
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:51,300
Earlier...

1465
00:58:51,300 --> 00:58:52,800
At the start of the week...

1466
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:54,460
Before this thing happens...

1467
00:58:54,460 --> 00:58:55,800
So it's like...

1468
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:57,180
Really difficult for me...

1469
00:58:57,180 --> 00:58:59,140
To just be like...

1470
00:58:59,140 --> 00:59:00,840
I'll tell you guys later...

1471
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:05,340
So...

1472
00:59:05,340 --> 00:59:06,640
So I have to like...

1473
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:07,240
Wait...

1474
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:08,340
And then just wait...

1475
00:59:08,340 --> 00:59:09,060
Until...

1476
00:59:09,060 --> 00:59:09,900
Because a lot...

1477
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:11,000
I realize...

1478
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,040
A lot of them tend to announce it...

1479
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:13,580
Um...

1480
00:59:13,580 --> 00:59:14,820
A lot later...

1481
00:59:14,820 --> 00:59:15,840
Before like...

1482
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:16,420
Which is...

1483
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:16,620
I...

1484
00:59:16,620 --> 00:59:16,980
I don't...

1485
00:59:16,980 --> 00:59:17,920
I'm not sure...

1486
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:18,940
Reasoning why...

1487
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:20,800
But I feel like it's very common...

1488
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:21,380
In like...

1489
00:59:21,380 --> 00:59:22,200
NA...

1490
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:23,400
Um...

1491
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:24,160
To like...

1492
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:24,400
Yeah...

1493
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:26,140
It's like a self-drop and stuff...

1494
00:59:26,140 --> 00:59:26,840
So it's like how...

1495
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:28,420
You know how streamers do like...

1496
00:59:28,420 --> 00:59:29,720
Early access streams...

1497
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:30,340
And like...

1498
00:59:30,340 --> 00:59:30,760
You know...

1499
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:31,280
Previews...

1500
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:32,800
They don't tell you guys...

1501
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:33,660
Like...

1502
00:59:33,660 --> 00:59:34,320
Like...

1503
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:34,540
You know...

1504
00:59:34,540 --> 00:59:36,360
They don't give you guys an early warning...

1505
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:38,720
It usually just happens on that day...

1506
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:39,420
And be like...

1507
00:59:39,420 --> 00:59:40,180
Hey guys...

1508
00:59:40,180 --> 00:59:42,060

1509
00:59:42,060 --> 00:59:42,380

1514
00:59:49,140 --> 00:59:50,100
I always have to be like...

1515
00:59:50,100 --> 00:59:50,420
Oh...

1516
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:51,520
When can I announce this?

1517
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:52,320
Because I have...

1518
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:52,580
You know...

1519
00:59:52,580 --> 00:59:53,560
I make my schedule...

1520
00:59:53,560 --> 00:59:54,640

1521
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:55,540

And a lot of people...

1527
01:00:01,620 --> 01:00:03,100
Rearrange their own schedules...

1528
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:03,660
To like...

1529
01:00:03,660 --> 01:00:04,480

Um...

1609
01:01:54,190 --> 01:01:55,010
Someone...

1610
01:01:55,010 --> 01:01:56,650
Made an edit of it...

1611
01:01:56,650 --> 01:01:57,270
And then...

1612
01:01:57,270 --> 01:01:59,190
Frel animated the edit...

1613
01:01:59,190 --> 01:01:59,830

By the way...

01:02:07,870 --> 01:02:09,910
I got fucked over by Uber Eats again...

1623
01:02:09,910 --> 01:02:10,890

01:02:10,890 --> 01:02:11,210

1626
01:02:11,550 --> 01:02:12,850
I've decided that...

1627
01:02:12,850 --> 01:02:15,050
I am swapping from Uber Eats...

1628
01:02:15,050 --> 01:02:16,710

1630
01:02:17,970 --> 01:02:19,710
The Canadian version...

1631
01:02:20,650 --> 01:02:21,650
I'm gonna...

1632
01:02:21,650 --> 01:02:22,550
I'm gonna...

1633
01:02:22,550 --> 01:02:25,370
I'm gonna do the Canadian...

1634
01:02:25,370 --> 01:02:25,970
Um...

1635
01:02:25,970 --> 01:02:27,870
The Canadian version of it...

1636
01:02:27,870 --> 01:02:29,170
And for those who are like...

1637
01:02:29,170 --> 01:02:30,090
Oh, what's the Canadian...

1638
01:02:30,090 --> 01:02:31,510
We have our own...

1639
01:02:31,510 --> 01:02:32,510
Food app...

1640
01:02:32,510 --> 01:02:34,210
Called Skip the Dishes...

1641
01:02:34,210 --> 01:02:35,330
And...

1642
01:02:35,330 --> 01:02:35,950
Um...

1643
01:02:35,950 --> 01:02:36,590
I am...

1644
01:02:36,590 --> 01:02:36,990
I've...

1645
01:02:36,990 --> 01:02:38,150
I've had...

1646
01:02:38,150 --> 01:02:38,990
Um...

1647
01:02:38,990 --> 01:02:40,430
An Uber Eats driver...

1648
01:02:40,430 --> 01:02:41,470
Fucked me over...

1649
01:02:41,470 --> 01:02:42,370
Again...

1650
01:02:42,370 --> 01:02:44,270
So how did he fuck me over?

1651
01:02:44,510 --> 01:02:45,110
So...

1652
01:02:45,110 --> 01:02:46,090
Basically...

1653
01:02:49,210 --> 01:02:49,850
Um...

1654
01:02:50,710 --> 01:02:51,350
Um...

1655
01:02:51,350 --> 01:02:51,870
Um...

1656
01:02:51,870 --> 01:02:52,230
Basically...

1657
01:02:52,230 --> 01:02:53,710
What happened was that...

1658
01:02:53,710 --> 01:02:55,370
I was ordering groceries...

1659
01:02:55,370 --> 01:02:55,950
Uh...

1660
01:02:55,950 --> 01:02:56,670
Because I...

1661
01:02:56,670 --> 01:02:57,530
Obviously like...

1662
01:02:57,530 --> 01:02:58,430
I needed groceries...

1663
01:02:58,430 --> 01:02:59,830
And I didn't wanna go to...

1664
01:02:59,830 --> 01:03:00,350
Um...

1665
01:03:00,350 --> 01:03:01,470
The place to get groceries...

1666
01:03:01,470 --> 01:03:02,470
Cause it's really far...

1667
01:03:02,470 --> 01:03:03,990
And I don't...

1668
01:03:03,990 --> 01:03:04,790
I have a car...

1669
01:03:04,790 --> 01:03:05,710
So I didn't wanna...

1670
01:03:05,710 --> 01:03:07,410
Walk all the way there...

1671
01:03:07,410 --> 01:03:08,910
And then walk all the way back...

1672
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:10,130
With the groceries...

1673
01:03:10,130 --> 01:03:10,730
So...

1674
01:03:10,730 --> 01:03:11,730
I was ordering groceries...

1675
01:03:12,270 --> 01:03:13,030
And...

1676
01:03:13,030 --> 01:03:13,610
Um...

1677
01:03:13,610 --> 01:03:14,450
The first time...

1678
01:03:14,450 --> 01:03:15,310
I was...

1679
01:03:15,310 --> 01:03:17,390
Monitoring the app...

1680
01:03:17,390 --> 01:03:18,350
I was monitoring...

1681
01:03:18,350 --> 01:03:19,210
Yeah...

1682
01:03:19,210 --> 01:03:20,510
And then...

1683
01:03:20,510 --> 01:03:21,210
Um...

1684
01:03:21,210 --> 01:03:21,670
You know...

1685
01:03:21,670 --> 01:03:23,210
They were shopping my stuff...

1686
01:03:23,210 --> 01:03:23,810
And...

1687
01:03:23,810 --> 01:03:24,330
Uh...

1688
01:03:24,330 --> 01:03:25,590
They were shopping my stuff...

1689
01:03:25,590 --> 01:03:27,130
And then I saw like...

1690
01:03:27,130 --> 01:03:28,450
Well it wasn't just groceries...

1691
01:03:28,450 --> 01:03:29,270
I also was like...

1692
01:03:29,270 --> 01:03:29,930
Getting like...

1693
01:03:29,930 --> 01:03:30,490
Um...

1694
01:03:30,490 --> 01:03:31,410
What's the word called?

1695
01:03:31,930 --> 01:03:32,670
You know...

1696
01:03:32,670 --> 01:03:33,750
Toilet paper...

1697
01:03:33,750 --> 01:03:34,510
And tissues...

1698
01:03:34,510 --> 01:03:35,470
And stuff like that...

1699
01:03:35,470 --> 01:03:37,110
Like it wasn't just like...

1700
01:03:37,110 --> 01:03:38,410
Grocery stuff...

1701
01:03:38,410 --> 01:03:38,970
And...

1702
01:03:38,970 --> 01:03:40,090
So I was watching it...

1703
01:03:40,090 --> 01:03:41,130
And then they were buying...

1704
01:03:41,130 --> 01:03:41,950
Everything...

1705
01:03:41,950 --> 01:03:42,870
And then...

1706
01:03:42,870 --> 01:03:43,470
They got...

1707
01:03:43,470 --> 01:03:43,890
You know...

1708
01:03:43,890 --> 01:03:44,430
They were like...

1709
01:03:44,430 --> 01:03:45,370
Wrapping up...

1710
01:03:45,370 --> 01:03:46,710
And then the order...

1711
01:03:46,710 --> 01:03:47,690
Canceled...

1712
01:03:47,690 --> 01:03:49,530
And I was so confused.

1713
01:03:49,770 --> 01:03:51,430
I was like, what?

1714
01:03:52,130 --> 01:03:55,550
Why did the... And then I had no record of the order.

1715
01:03:55,730 --> 01:03:57,550
So it didn't show up.

1716
01:03:57,990 --> 01:04:01,510
I was like, what happened?

1717
01:04:02,030 --> 01:04:03,690
Like, it just disappeared.

1718
01:04:03,690 --> 01:04:05,710
I was like, do I get a refund?

1719
01:04:06,050 --> 01:04:10,690
I could go to the help desk to be like, what's going on?

1720
01:04:10,710 --> 01:04:12,710
Because the order fucking disappeared.

1721
01:04:13,210 --> 01:04:17,470
It wasn't even at my, like, past orders.

1722
01:04:17,690 --> 01:04:19,650
So I was like, okay.

1723
01:04:20,070 --> 01:04:21,450
I'm gonna reorder it.

1724
01:04:21,910 --> 01:04:24,150
So then I reordered my stuff.

1725
01:04:24,570 --> 01:04:26,490
Because I was like, what the fuck is going on?

1726
01:04:26,690 --> 01:04:28,410
And so I reordered my stuff.

1727
01:04:28,630 --> 01:04:32,850
And later, I got a pop-up and said, the order was cancelled.

1728
01:04:33,270 --> 01:04:34,790
So then I was like, what?

1729
01:04:35,230 --> 01:04:36,170
But like, okay.

1730
01:04:36,290 --> 01:04:39,810
And then I figured out that... But this was like an hour.

1731
01:04:40,010 --> 01:04:40,450
Like, not an hour.

1732
01:04:40,630 --> 01:04:49,910
30 minutes later, it popped up to tell me the old order was cancelled.

1733
01:04:50,270 --> 01:04:52,950
I thought that order was for my new order.

1734
01:04:52,950 --> 01:04:54,910
So I got really confused.

1735
01:04:55,150 --> 01:04:56,570
I was like, it got cancelled again?

1736
01:04:56,930 --> 01:04:58,970
So I went to the help desk this time.

1737
01:04:59,250 --> 01:05:01,970
And then they're like, oh, sorry.

1738
01:05:02,350 --> 01:05:04,170
This was for your first order, by the way.

1739
01:05:04,270 --> 01:05:05,690
Your current order is still in progress.

1740
01:05:06,270 --> 01:05:07,170
And... But don't worry.

1741
01:05:07,290 --> 01:05:08,550
Your card was not charged.

1742
01:05:08,550 --> 01:05:09,650
So I was like, okay.

1743
01:05:09,650 --> 01:05:11,610
But what the fuck happened?

1744
01:05:12,210 --> 01:05:25,150
And then the support desk was like, the guy that was paying for your order did not have enough money to pay for it.

1745
01:05:25,330 --> 01:05:30,130
And I was like, why did he take my order?

1746
01:05:34,050 --> 01:05:47,990
So he cancelled it because he got everything, went to the cashier, and didn't have enough money to pay for my order.

1747
01:05:48,710 --> 01:05:53,890
And I was like, why did he take it then?

1748
01:05:57,790 --> 01:06:05,290
Why would you take a grocery order if you can't pay for it?

1749
01:06:05,490 --> 01:06:07,450
I don't understand.

1750
01:06:07,910 --> 01:06:10,910
I was so confused.

1751
01:06:12,330 --> 01:06:14,570
I was like, you could take like...

1752
01:06:15,750 --> 01:06:18,810
You could take like the Uber Eats orders.

1753
01:06:18,810 --> 01:06:23,990
Why did he take my grocery order?

1754
01:06:24,010 --> 01:06:24,090
Why did he take my grocery order?

1755
01:06:25,650 --> 01:06:26,070
Like...

1756
01:06:26,750 --> 01:06:27,170
So...

1757
01:06:27,170 --> 01:06:29,010
So I was like...

1758
01:06:29,010 --> 01:06:31,030
I was so confused.

1759
01:06:31,030 --> 01:06:38,450
Like, if you're struggling, and don't have enough to pay for my groceries, then don't take it.

1760
01:06:39,030 --> 01:06:39,870
Like...

1761
01:06:40,870 --> 01:06:43,090
No, it was $50.

1762
01:06:43,810 --> 01:06:47,290
It was $50 Canadian dollars.

1763
01:06:47,290 --> 01:06:49,730
I was so confused.

1764
01:06:49,730 --> 01:06:49,830
I was so confused.

1765
01:06:51,270 --> 01:06:52,550
Um...

1766
01:06:52,550 --> 01:06:53,290
Anyway...

1767
01:06:54,050 --> 01:06:55,610
Um...

1768
01:06:55,610 --> 01:06:57,790
So...

1769
01:06:57,790 --> 01:06:59,530
After that...

1770
01:06:59,530 --> 01:07:02,030
I reordered it again.

1771
01:07:02,530 --> 01:07:04,830
And it arrived this time.

1772
01:07:05,030 --> 01:07:12,870
But I got fucked over so much by Uber Eats that I'm swapping.

1773
01:07:12,870 --> 01:07:25,670
Because three times within two weeks of getting fucked over is like a little bit too many times.

1774
01:07:26,310 --> 01:07:26,630
Like...

1775
01:07:26,630 --> 01:07:29,390
And this was all within two weeks.

1776
01:07:29,810 --> 01:07:31,650
So I was just like...

1777
01:07:31,650 --> 01:07:33,090
I cannot...

1778
01:07:33,090 --> 01:07:34,950
I cannot deal with that.

1779
01:07:35,070 --> 01:07:37,330
My luck is way too bad.

1780
01:07:37,330 --> 01:07:39,890
So I'm not using Uber Eats anymore.

1781
01:07:41,430 --> 01:07:42,090
Um...

1782
01:07:42,890 --> 01:07:44,650
But yeah, I was like...

1783
01:07:44,650 --> 01:07:45,630
That's so sad.

1784
01:07:45,970 --> 01:07:46,610
I was like...

1785
01:07:46,610 --> 01:07:48,310
Bro, he is having it rough.

1786
01:07:48,310 --> 01:07:49,510
But also...

1787
01:07:49,510 --> 01:07:52,370
Bro, why did you take my order?

1788
01:07:52,370 --> 01:07:55,370
I don't ever understand.

1789
01:07:56,030 --> 01:07:56,670
I...

1790
01:07:59,930 --> 01:08:01,210
I thought...

1791
01:08:01,210 --> 01:08:01,730
I was like...

1792
01:08:01,730 --> 01:08:03,290
And then he cancels it.

1793
01:08:03,690 --> 01:08:05,650
Why couldn't a different person...

1794
01:08:05,650 --> 01:08:08,350
Why couldn't he just give it to a different person?

1795
01:08:08,950 --> 01:08:09,590
Like...

1796
01:08:09,590 --> 01:08:10,810
I don't know why...

1797
01:08:10,810 --> 01:08:12,390
He cancelled it too.

1798
01:08:12,850 --> 01:08:15,210
Why couldn't he just...

1799
01:08:15,210 --> 01:08:16,750
Say, I will take this order.

1800
01:08:16,970 --> 01:08:18,150
And then another person...

1801
01:08:18,150 --> 01:08:19,810
I had to reorder everything.

1802
01:08:19,810 --> 01:08:21,610
That was the worst part.

1803
01:08:21,870 --> 01:08:22,890
I had to like...

1804
01:08:24,090 --> 01:08:24,570
Reorder...

1805
01:08:24,570 --> 01:08:25,150
Everything.

1806
01:08:25,930 --> 01:08:26,930
And then like...

1807
01:08:27,690 --> 01:08:28,170
Um...

1808
01:08:28,170 --> 01:08:29,290
I had to reorder everything.

1809
01:08:29,450 --> 01:08:31,510
I had to remember what I ordered too.

1810
01:08:31,730 --> 01:08:33,090
Because obviously like...

1811
01:08:33,090 --> 01:08:33,810
He cancelled it.

1812
01:08:33,890 --> 01:08:35,150
So I don't have records of it.

1813
01:08:35,270 --> 01:08:37,990
It only showed up an hour later.

1814
01:08:40,050 --> 01:08:40,530
Um...

1815
01:08:41,770 --> 01:08:42,250
Um...

1816
01:08:42,250 --> 01:08:42,910
Anyway...

1817
01:08:42,910 --> 01:08:43,630
What else I was gonna say?

1818
01:08:43,910 --> 01:08:44,350
Oh yeah.

1819
01:08:44,970 --> 01:08:45,450
Also...

1820
01:08:45,450 --> 01:08:47,210
Guys, did you hear about the new Fortnite update?

1821
01:08:47,290 --> 01:08:49,030
Sorry, this is a weird segue.

1822
01:08:51,470 --> 01:08:52,130
Um...

1823
01:08:52,130 --> 01:08:52,770
It's...

1824
01:08:52,770 --> 01:08:53,630
It's a...

1825
01:08:53,630 --> 01:08:55,150
It's a fucking weird segue.

1826
01:08:55,450 --> 01:08:57,950
But I had to talk about the new Fortnite update.

1827
01:08:58,490 --> 01:08:58,930
Um...

1828
01:08:58,930 --> 01:09:01,250
So for those who don't know...

1829
01:09:01,250 --> 01:09:02,910
The new Fortnite update...

1830
01:09:02,910 --> 01:09:04,310
They added...

1831
01:09:04,310 --> 01:09:05,030
Darth Vader?

1832
01:09:05,350 --> 01:09:06,390
And then like...

1833
01:09:06,390 --> 01:09:08,970
So the voice actor for Darth Vader...

1834
01:09:08,970 --> 01:09:09,890
Passed away.

1835
01:09:10,370 --> 01:09:12,270
But he sold his voice...

1836
01:09:12,270 --> 01:09:12,950
To Disney.

1837
01:09:13,330 --> 01:09:15,090
So they could make AI...

1838
01:09:15,090 --> 01:09:16,510
An AI Darth Vader.

1839
01:09:16,830 --> 01:09:17,350
So...

1840
01:09:17,350 --> 01:09:18,970
Because of that...

1841
01:09:18,970 --> 01:09:19,930
Um...

1842
01:09:19,930 --> 01:09:20,970
Fortnite...

1843
01:09:21,570 --> 01:09:23,230
Decided to utilize...

1844
01:09:23,230 --> 01:09:26,550
The AI Darth Vader...

1845
01:09:26,550 --> 01:09:27,990
And he gets...

1846
01:09:27,990 --> 01:09:28,770
He...

1847
01:09:28,770 --> 01:09:30,070
I...

1848
01:09:30,070 --> 01:09:31,770
I saw some of the clips...

1849
01:09:31,770 --> 01:09:33,230
And he talks about...

1850
01:09:33,230 --> 01:09:33,750
Gooning...

1851
01:09:33,750 --> 01:09:34,230
And...

1852
01:09:38,290 --> 01:09:39,250
I...

1853
01:09:39,250 --> 01:09:39,310
I...

1854
01:09:39,310 --> 01:09:39,890
I was like...

1855
01:09:39,890 --> 01:09:41,210
What the fuck?

1856
01:09:41,630 --> 01:09:42,190
Okay...

1857
01:09:42,190 --> 01:09:42,870
Let me...

1858
01:09:42,870 --> 01:09:44,110
I was like...

1859
01:09:44,110 --> 01:09:45,050
Yeah...

1860
01:09:45,050 --> 01:09:46,590
I saw...

1861
01:09:46,590 --> 01:09:48,610
Some of the clips...

1862
01:09:48,610 --> 01:09:49,330
Are...

1863
01:09:49,330 --> 01:09:50,210
Fucking...

1864
01:09:50,210 --> 01:09:50,910
Wild...

1865
01:09:50,910 --> 01:09:52,270
And then people...

1866
01:09:52,270 --> 01:09:52,890
And then...

1867
01:09:52,890 --> 01:09:54,190
The Fortnite was like...

1868
01:09:54,190 --> 01:09:56,630
This was not supposed to happen...

1869
01:10:01,070 --> 01:10:01,550
And...

1870
01:10:01,550 --> 01:10:02,310
And...

1871
01:10:02,310 --> 01:10:02,390
And...

1872
01:10:02,390 --> 01:10:02,790
And...

1873
01:10:02,790 --> 01:10:02,890
I...

1874
01:10:02,890 --> 01:10:04,510
I'm trying to remember...

1875
01:10:04,510 --> 01:10:05,450
Like...

1876
01:10:05,450 --> 01:10:06,290
Um...

1877
01:10:06,290 --> 01:10:06,970
I'm trying...

1878
01:10:06,970 --> 01:10:08,150
I don't know where the clips...

1879
01:10:08,150 --> 01:10:09,950
I'm trying to find a clip right now...

1880
01:10:09,950 --> 01:10:10,910
But like...

1881
01:10:11,730 --> 01:10:12,210
Um...

1882
01:10:12,210 --> 01:10:13,350
You see something...

1883
01:10:14,250 --> 01:10:16,050
Let me see if I can find it...

1884
01:10:16,050 --> 01:10:17,370
There's like a clip of him...

1885
01:10:17,370 --> 01:10:19,010
Talking about gooning and edging...

1886
01:10:19,010 --> 01:10:19,770
And I was like...

1887
01:10:19,770 --> 01:10:20,350
Oh my god...

1888
01:10:24,130 --> 01:10:26,270
What did they think was gonna...

1889
01:10:26,270 --> 01:10:27,070
I don't...

1890
01:10:27,070 --> 01:10:28,450
I don't know...

1891
01:10:28,450 --> 01:10:29,010
But clearly...

1892
01:10:29,010 --> 01:10:30,630
They did not think this through...

1893
01:10:30,630 --> 01:10:31,350
Clearly...

1894
01:10:31,350 --> 01:10:32,330
If you put...

1895
01:10:32,330 --> 01:10:34,050
Especially in Fortnite...

1896
01:10:34,050 --> 01:10:35,070
Of all games...

1897
01:10:35,070 --> 01:10:35,410
Like...

1898
01:10:35,410 --> 01:10:35,770
They're...

1899
01:10:35,770 --> 01:10:38,310
We have some gamers in Fortnite...

1900
01:10:39,010 --> 01:10:39,410
We...

1901
01:10:41,670 --> 01:10:42,690
We have...

1902
01:10:43,030 --> 01:10:43,510
We have...

1903
01:10:43,510 --> 01:10:44,170
Oh yeah...

1904
01:10:44,170 --> 01:10:44,710
And also...

1905
01:10:44,710 --> 01:10:46,470
He gets the races too...

1906
01:10:46,470 --> 01:10:47,390
I was like...

1907
01:10:47,390 --> 01:10:48,070
Holy...

1908
01:10:48,070 --> 01:10:48,970
Guys...

1909
01:10:48,970 --> 01:10:51,410
I don't think Disney's gonna let...

1910
01:10:52,470 --> 01:10:53,150
Guys...

1911
01:10:53,150 --> 01:10:55,730
I don't think Disney's gonna let Fortnite do any...

1912
01:10:55,950 --> 01:10:57,510
I don't do any more...

1913
01:10:57,950 --> 01:10:59,550
Any more of this...

1914
01:11:00,550 --> 01:11:01,230
Um...

1915
01:11:01,230 --> 01:11:03,550
I'm trying to find the gooning clip...

1916
01:11:03,990 --> 01:11:05,910
That one was wild...

1917
01:11:05,910 --> 01:11:06,270
I...

1918
01:11:06,270 --> 01:11:08,410
I think that one was wild...

1919
01:11:10,670 --> 01:11:11,660
Oh yeah...

1920
01:11:11,990 --> 01:11:13,480
I like the Hatsune Miku...

1921
01:11:15,310 --> 01:11:15,970
Wait...

1922
01:11:15,970 --> 01:11:16,830
Let me find the...

1923
01:11:16,830 --> 01:11:17,750
Miku clip...

1924
01:11:17,750 --> 01:11:18,210
That...

1925
01:11:18,210 --> 01:11:20,070
Miku clip was funny too...

1926
01:11:20,070 --> 01:11:21,410
Let's see...

1927
01:11:22,630 --> 01:11:23,290
Here...

1928
01:11:23,290 --> 01:11:24,560
This one's my favorite too...

1929
01:11:25,110 --> 01:11:25,410
I...

1930
01:11:27,950 --> 01:11:29,270
I like...

1931
01:11:29,270 --> 01:11:29,710
Wait...

1932
01:11:29,710 --> 01:11:31,570
I'm gonna try and see if I can find the...

1933
01:11:31,570 --> 01:11:32,530
Goon one...

1934
01:11:32,530 --> 01:11:33,540
That one's important...

1935
01:11:34,670 --> 01:11:37,670
I'm trying to find the Goon clip guys...

1936
01:11:37,670 --> 01:11:38,290
Okay...

1937
01:11:38,290 --> 01:11:39,150
Let me see if...

1938
01:11:39,150 --> 01:11:41,010
Was it like...

1939
01:11:41,010 --> 01:11:42,170
Vader...

1940
01:11:42,170 --> 01:11:42,790
Edgy...

1941
01:11:43,670 --> 01:11:44,750
God...

1942
01:11:44,750 --> 01:11:47,150
My fucking search bar...

1943
01:11:47,150 --> 01:11:47,750
Wait...

1944
01:11:48,950 --> 01:11:50,670
I'm literally looking up...

1945
01:11:50,670 --> 01:11:51,770
Fortnite...

1946
01:11:51,770 --> 01:11:53,110
Vader...

1947
01:11:53,110 --> 01:11:54,450
Edgy...

1948
01:11:54,450 --> 01:11:55,110
Okay...

1949
01:11:55,110 --> 01:11:56,470
Don't...

1950
01:11:56,470 --> 01:11:56,890
I...

1951
01:11:56,890 --> 01:11:57,390
Look...

1952
01:11:57,390 --> 01:11:58,370
This is important...

1953
01:11:58,370 --> 01:11:58,990
It was...

1954
01:11:58,990 --> 01:12:00,770
Really funny...

1955
01:12:00,770 --> 01:12:01,170
It...

1956
01:12:03,060 --> 01:12:05,570
You don't understand...

1957
01:12:05,570 --> 01:12:06,690
It was...

1958
01:12:06,690 --> 01:12:07,770
Really...

1959
01:12:07,770 --> 01:12:08,630
Funny...

1960
01:12:08,630 --> 01:12:09,670
Okay...

1961
01:12:09,670 --> 01:12:10,210
Oh...

1962
01:12:10,210 --> 01:12:11,770
There you go...

1963
01:12:11,770 --> 01:12:33,330
I found another one...

1964
01:12:33,330 --> 01:12:35,870
This one's pretty good...

1965
01:12:35,870 --> 01:12:37,530
Oh...

1966
01:12:37,530 --> 01:12:38,310
Here...

1967
01:12:38,310 --> 01:12:38,930
Here's the...

1968
01:12:38,930 --> 01:12:40,010
Here it is...

1969
01:12:40,010 --> 01:12:40,430
Guys...

1970
01:12:40,430 --> 01:12:42,150
I found it...

1971
01:12:42,150 --> 01:12:42,850
Here...

1972
01:12:42,850 --> 01:12:43,510
I'll even...

1973
01:12:43,510 --> 01:12:44,130
Guys...

1974
01:12:44,130 --> 01:12:44,770
I'll even...

1975
01:12:44,770 --> 01:12:45,350
Turn on...

1976
01:12:45,350 --> 01:12:46,910
I'll turn this on...

1977
01:12:46,910 --> 01:12:47,790
Just for you guys...

1978
01:12:48,330 --> 01:12:49,010
So you can hear...

1979
01:12:49,010 --> 01:12:49,650
Darth Vader...

1980
01:12:49,650 --> 01:12:50,770
Say this...

1981
01:12:51,330 --> 01:12:52,010
Edging...

1982
01:12:52,010 --> 01:12:52,310
And...

1983
01:12:55,750 --> 01:12:56,510
Gooning...

1984
01:12:56,510 --> 01:12:57,650
Edging...

1985
01:12:57,650 --> 01:12:57,770
And...

1986
01:12:59,110 --> 01:12:59,870
Gooning...

1987
01:12:59,870 --> 01:13:00,590
Edging...

1988
01:13:13,990 --> 01:13:14,750
And...

1989
01:13:14,750 --> 01:13:15,750
Just remember...

1990
01:13:16,270 --> 01:13:17,990
He passed away...

1991
01:13:18,550 --> 01:13:19,090
And...

1992
01:13:19,090 --> 01:13:21,890
Then he sold his voice to Disney...

1993
01:13:22,530 --> 01:13:24,130
So this could happen...

1994
01:13:24,890 --> 01:13:25,510
Like...

1995
01:13:25,510 --> 01:13:25,890
I...

1996
01:13:25,890 --> 01:13:28,190
This is not my fault...

1997
01:13:28,730 --> 01:13:29,490
This is...

1998
01:13:29,490 --> 01:13:29,850
This is...

1999
01:13:29,850 --> 01:13:30,950
Alright...

2000
01:13:30,950 --> 01:13:31,730
This one too...

2001
01:13:31,730 --> 01:13:32,810
I like this one...

2002
01:13:32,810 --> 01:13:33,750
This one's funny...

2003
01:13:35,390 --> 01:13:36,350
Here...

2004
01:13:36,350 --> 01:13:37,750
Listen to this...

2005
01:13:39,430 --> 01:13:40,930
Hatsune Miku...

2006
01:13:40,930 --> 01:13:42,890
Your training is complete...

2007
01:13:52,850 --> 01:13:55,010
Hatsune Miku...

2008
01:13:55,010 --> 01:13:56,450
Hatsune Miku...

2009
01:13:56,450 --> 01:13:59,890
Hatsune Miku...

2010
01:13:59,890 --> 01:14:03,210
Hatsune Miku...

2011
01:14:03,210 --> 01:14:07,250
Hatsune Miku...

2012
01:14:07,250 --> 01:14:10,370
Hatsune Miku...

2013
01:14:10,370 --> 01:14:11,170
Hatsune Miku...

2014
01:14:11,170 --> 01:14:11,230
Hatsune Miku...

2015
01:14:11,230 --> 01:14:12,870
Hatsune Miku...

2016
01:14:12,870 --> 01:14:14,550
Wait, where is that?

2017
01:14:17,110 --> 01:14:17,630
No!

2018
01:14:18,370 --> 01:14:20,210
Okay, I don't know if I can find...

2019
01:14:20,210 --> 01:14:24,750
I can find Vader and Hatsune Miku fucking killing the lobby.

2020
01:14:24,990 --> 01:14:26,090
Because that shit was good.

2021
01:14:28,530 --> 01:14:30,530
Oh, yeah, there's this one.

2022
01:14:30,650 --> 01:14:31,590
Wait, I'll show you this one.

2023
01:14:35,030 --> 01:14:36,390
Hatsune Miku is hit.

2024
01:14:36,830 --> 01:14:38,270
Find cover quickly.

2025
01:14:40,630 --> 01:14:42,490
No, Hatsune Miku!

2026
01:14:42,490 --> 01:14:42,970
No!

2027
01:14:43,390 --> 01:14:45,630
Someone protect me!

2028
01:14:45,910 --> 01:14:52,630
Oh my god.

2029
01:14:53,070 --> 01:14:54,830
No, not Miku!

2030
01:14:55,050 --> 01:14:56,910
Someone save Miku!

2031
01:15:01,050 --> 01:15:02,550
Too much.

2032
01:15:02,950 --> 01:15:08,770
Bro, he just... Bro, Darth Vader just really, really likes Hatsune Miku.

2033
01:15:08,930 --> 01:15:10,370
You don't understand.

2034
01:15:10,370 --> 01:15:12,150
He just...

2035
01:15:12,150 --> 01:15:18,730
In fact, I will say there's not enough emotion for Hatsune Miku.

2036
01:15:24,190 --> 01:15:25,870
But yeah, that's basically like...

2037
01:15:27,670 --> 01:15:29,530
So yeah, Disney's not happy.

2038
01:15:30,110 --> 01:15:32,050
But like, when has Disney ever been happy?

2039
01:15:32,050 --> 01:15:32,790
Not gonna...

2040
01:15:34,450 --> 01:15:36,870
Disney is usually never happy.

2041
01:15:37,470 --> 01:15:38,030
Um...

2042
01:15:40,570 --> 01:15:44,290
I mean, it was their fault for like...

2043
01:15:44,290 --> 01:15:46,790
I don't know why they thought that was a good idea.

2044
01:15:47,230 --> 01:15:48,390
Fortnite of all places.

2045
01:15:48,790 --> 01:15:51,490
Like, there are some fucking gamers in Fortnite too.

2046
01:15:53,190 --> 01:15:53,670
So...

2047
01:15:54,330 --> 01:15:54,810
Um...

2048
01:15:54,810 --> 01:15:56,750
So it's crazy that like...

2049
01:15:56,750 --> 01:15:57,390
Um...

2050
01:15:57,390 --> 01:15:59,050
They thought that, you know...

2051
01:15:59,050 --> 01:16:01,690
You know, you could say in the boardroom...

2052
01:16:01,690 --> 01:16:02,550
They must be like...

2053
01:16:02,550 --> 01:16:03,510
Oh my god, guys.

2054
01:16:03,770 --> 01:16:05,510
That is a great idea, Jerry.

2055
01:16:05,510 --> 01:16:10,150
We should definitely use that AI feature of Darth Vader.

2056
01:16:10,350 --> 01:16:13,510
So like, it could be tailored to each user's experience.

2057
01:16:14,030 --> 01:16:15,830
What a good idea, Jerry.

2058
01:16:16,130 --> 01:16:17,350
What could go wrong?

2059
01:16:17,350 --> 01:16:19,810
But then they sort of forgot...

2060
01:16:19,810 --> 01:16:20,350
That...

2061
01:16:20,890 --> 01:16:22,390
Gamers are like...

2062
01:16:22,390 --> 01:16:23,230
Fucked up people.

2063
01:16:23,470 --> 01:16:24,090
And like...

2064
01:16:24,090 --> 01:16:25,690
I can say it cause I'm a gamer.

2065
01:16:27,450 --> 01:16:28,050
Um...

2066
01:16:29,850 --> 01:16:31,050
Our imagination...

2067
01:16:31,050 --> 01:16:32,390
Knows no bounds.

2068
01:16:32,850 --> 01:16:33,410
If we...

2069
01:16:36,290 --> 01:16:38,250
People can get really creative.

2070
01:16:38,730 --> 01:16:41,390
Even if you try to put restrictions in there.

2071
01:16:41,810 --> 01:16:43,470
People can get very creative...

2072
01:16:44,190 --> 01:16:47,050
On trying to make them say really bad things.

2073
01:16:48,390 --> 01:16:48,950
персонаж...

2074
01:16:48,950 --> 01:16:49,970
He was laughing.

2075
01:16:52,090 --> 01:16:52,650
So...

2076
01:16:55,170 --> 01:16:55,730
Umm...

2077
01:16:56,750 --> 01:16:58,830
So I thought that was really silly.

2078
01:16:59,110 --> 01:17:00,030
Cause I was like...

2079
01:17:00,030 --> 01:17:01,050
Everywhere in my timeline.

2080
01:17:01,370 --> 01:17:02,390
And everybody was...

2081
01:17:02,390 --> 01:17:04,550
Everybody was like...

2082
01:17:04,550 --> 01:17:05,190
Try to...

2083
01:17:05,190 --> 01:17:06,470
Try to be like...

2084
01:17:06,470 --> 01:17:08,730
Let's see what we can get Darth Vader to say!

2085
01:17:09,090 --> 01:17:11,890
He nei nei nei nei nei Uh...

2086
01:17:11,890 --> 01:17:15,690
Yeah, people will spend hours to try and break the filter.

2087
01:17:16,050 --> 01:17:16,610
And like...

2088
01:17:16,610 --> 01:17:18,350
Like, um, they succeeded.

2089
01:17:18,630 --> 01:17:20,930
And Disney is, like, very, very mad.

2090
01:17:23,350 --> 01:17:24,130
Oh, yeah.

2091
01:17:24,690 --> 01:17:25,370
Oh, yeah.

2092
01:17:25,770 --> 01:17:27,350
By the way, for the member goons.

2093
01:17:27,810 --> 01:17:30,090
Um, I feel... Today, I feel really generous.

2094
01:17:30,090 --> 01:17:35,850
So, I'm gonna send... I'm gonna show the preview of the... I'm gonna show the preview of next month's wallpaper.

2095
01:17:36,330 --> 01:17:38,410
By the way, May's wallpaper is out now.

2096
01:17:38,510 --> 01:17:40,150
So, not member goons.

2097
01:17:40,530 --> 01:17:41,250
I'm sorry.

2098
01:17:44,290 --> 01:17:47,490
By the way, this wallpaper was for January.

2099
01:17:48,390 --> 01:17:49,870
Just so you guys know.

2100
01:17:50,070 --> 01:17:52,890
This was the missing wallpaper that we never got.

2101
01:17:53,150 --> 01:17:58,890
So, like, I know next month's wallpaper is... We're gonna get, like, two wallpapers for June.

2102
01:17:59,150 --> 01:17:59,990
I think.

2103
01:18:00,210 --> 01:18:05,410
Because, like, obviously, one is, like... Gonna be more appropriately themed to June.

2104
01:18:05,670 --> 01:18:08,130
But, like, this was supposed to be January.

2105
01:18:08,130 --> 01:18:08,290
Wait.

2106
01:18:09,650 --> 01:18:14,390
So, we're releasing... We're releasing a winter wallpaper.

2107
01:18:14,870 --> 01:18:18,610
Um, in... In... In June.

2108
01:18:20,530 --> 01:18:21,090
Um...

2109
01:18:21,090 --> 01:18:24,590
So, this was supposed to be the new... Uh, so, yeah.

2110
01:18:24,650 --> 01:18:25,550
Look forward to that.

2111
01:18:25,730 --> 01:18:27,350
This was for the mem... Uh, for members.

2112
01:18:27,790 --> 01:18:34,350
But, as you don't know, um, each month, um, in, uh, members, I release a free wallpaper for everybody.

2113
01:18:34,350 --> 01:18:36,610
So, this is another night... Light mode wallpaper.

2114
01:18:36,810 --> 01:18:37,070
I'm sorry.

2115
01:18:39,070 --> 01:18:41,650
We... We do have some dark wallpapers, too.

2116
01:18:41,790 --> 01:18:44,070
For the... For those who don't want to get blinded.

2117
01:18:44,510 --> 01:18:44,990
Uh, oh, yeah.

2118
01:18:45,050 --> 01:18:45,830
This is for Australia.

2119
01:18:45,910 --> 01:18:46,570
You're right.

2120
01:18:47,010 --> 01:18:47,930
Australia goons.

2121
01:18:48,110 --> 01:18:49,590
We have a wallpaper for you.

2122
01:18:49,610 --> 01:18:50,690
So, you can relate.

2123
01:18:52,530 --> 01:18:52,970
Uh...

2124
01:18:54,110 --> 01:18:56,830
So, these are for, um...

2125
01:18:57,550 --> 01:18:59,490
This is for the member goons.

2126
01:18:59,930 --> 01:19:00,210
Uh...

2127
01:19:00,210 --> 01:19:00,450
Anyway.

2128
01:19:00,790 --> 01:19:01,210
Oh, Mike!

2129
01:19:01,350 --> 01:19:02,170
Thank you for the super chat.

2130
01:19:02,270 --> 01:19:02,510
Thank you.

2131
01:19:02,590 --> 01:19:03,030
Thank you.

2132
01:19:03,090 --> 01:19:04,430
The real message of the movie.

2133
01:19:04,590 --> 01:19:05,770
Nerf Captain America.

2134
01:19:06,390 --> 01:19:07,950
Thank you for the super chat.

2135
01:19:08,070 --> 01:19:08,370
Thank you.

2136
01:19:08,450 --> 01:19:08,850
Thank you.

2137
01:19:09,090 --> 01:19:10,930
But, it was nice to stream again.

2138
01:19:11,050 --> 01:19:11,830
Oh, my God.

2139
01:19:12,510 --> 01:19:14,170
I, uh... I really miss streaming.

2140
01:19:14,530 --> 01:19:16,530
It has been quite a while.

2141
01:19:16,910 --> 01:19:21,010
Um, whenever, you know, whenever I don't stream, I always forget what it's like to stream again.

2142
01:19:21,010 --> 01:19:23,490
So, it's great to be able to stream again for you guys.

2143
01:19:23,590 --> 01:19:24,350
To talk to you guys.

2144
01:19:24,430 --> 01:19:25,770
Give you guys some life updates.

2145
01:19:25,770 --> 01:19:28,590
About what the fuck was going on in my life.

2146
01:19:28,690 --> 01:19:29,390
In general.

2147
01:19:29,930 --> 01:19:30,350
Uh, D4.

2148
01:19:30,470 --> 01:19:31,330
Thank you for the super chat.

2149
01:19:31,450 --> 01:19:31,670
Thank you.

2150
01:19:31,770 --> 01:19:32,190
Thank you.

2151
01:19:32,330 --> 01:19:34,110
Bucky is 110 years old.

2152
01:19:34,550 --> 01:19:36,430
Just young enough for U.S.

2153
01:19:36,610 --> 01:19:37,010
Congress.

2154
01:19:38,370 --> 01:19:38,830
Jesus.

2155
01:19:39,330 --> 01:19:40,970
Thank you for the super chat.

2156
01:19:41,110 --> 01:19:41,370
Thank you.

2157
01:19:41,510 --> 01:19:41,930
Thank you.

2158
01:19:42,170 --> 01:19:45,410
Also, I realized my super chat records, like, just stopped working.

2159
01:19:45,670 --> 01:19:47,850
So, I need to refresh it real quick.

2160
01:19:47,850 --> 01:19:49,330
So, I can see...

2161
01:19:49,330 --> 01:19:50,330
The... Oh, yeah.

2162
01:19:50,590 --> 01:19:50,870
Definitely.

2163
01:19:50,870 --> 01:19:52,390
I've not seen these super chats.

2164
01:19:54,450 --> 01:19:56,430
Uh, Rodrigo.

2165
01:19:56,510 --> 01:19:57,370
Thank you for the super chat.

2166
01:19:57,510 --> 01:19:57,710
Thank you.

2167
01:19:57,830 --> 01:19:58,310
Thank you.

2168
01:19:58,530 --> 01:19:59,610
So happy to have you back.

2169
01:19:59,690 --> 01:20:01,770
Where else would I get my unhinged AI updates?

2170
01:20:01,930 --> 01:20:02,790
Love your wallpapers.

2171
01:20:02,950 --> 01:20:03,650
They're always so cute.

2172
01:20:03,790 --> 01:20:04,650
Thank you for the super chat.

2173
01:20:04,770 --> 01:20:04,970
Thank you.

2174
01:20:05,050 --> 01:20:05,570
Thank you.

2175
01:20:06,030 --> 01:20:06,790
Uh, Fudge Stop.

2176
01:20:06,930 --> 01:20:07,690
Thank you for the super chat.

2177
01:20:07,790 --> 01:20:07,990
Thank you.

2178
01:20:08,090 --> 01:20:08,530
Thank you.

2179
01:20:08,770 --> 01:20:12,390
A reminder that George Lucas hired a guy who did Chad Vader parody voices...

2180
01:20:12,970 --> 01:20:15,650
Videos to voice Darth Vader for Forces Unleashed.

2181
01:20:15,890 --> 01:20:18,750
Now, we're listening to a dead celebrity talk about gooning...

2182
01:20:20,730 --> 01:20:22,490
Thank you for the super chat.

2183
01:20:22,650 --> 01:20:22,870
Thank you.

2184
01:20:22,970 --> 01:20:23,390
Thank you.

2185
01:20:23,470 --> 01:20:27,530
I don't understand why we couldn't just get an impersonator.

2186
01:20:28,130 --> 01:20:29,950
Okay, I understand money.

2187
01:20:31,370 --> 01:20:32,270
Never mind.

2188
01:20:32,710 --> 01:20:33,190
Sorry, guys.

2189
01:20:33,410 --> 01:20:35,190
I understand money.

2190
01:20:38,070 --> 01:20:38,690
Capitalism.

2191
01:20:40,110 --> 01:20:45,690
Because it's cheaper to do it instead of hiring an impersonator.

2192
01:20:45,690 --> 01:20:53,430
Because I was like, we've had impersonators for Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny and all that shit.

2193
01:20:53,590 --> 01:21:00,750
So I was just like, wait, why are we using AI to do Darth Vader's voice?

2194
01:21:00,950 --> 01:21:03,630
I just think it's not even that natural.

2195
01:21:03,830 --> 01:21:05,530
That's my biggest issue.

2196
01:21:05,730 --> 01:21:06,810
Not my only issue.

2197
01:21:06,830 --> 01:21:10,730
Obviously, we're denying voice actors money right now.

2198
01:21:12,010 --> 01:21:12,850
Sorry, guys.

2199
01:21:13,110 --> 01:21:16,650
That is not the only issue about it not sounding real.

2200
01:21:16,930 --> 01:21:18,790
There's a lot of other issues.

2201
01:21:20,930 --> 01:21:25,130
But like, it doesn't even sound like real.

2202
01:21:25,630 --> 01:21:27,650
That's like my problem for me.

2203
01:21:27,850 --> 01:21:30,510
Is that it just sounds so bad.

2204
01:21:31,430 --> 01:21:45,490
And like, I have that same issue with people like using with them using AI to recreate dead or like de-age actors.

2205
01:21:46,210 --> 01:21:48,750
Like, you know how like, what was it?

2206
01:21:48,830 --> 01:21:57,230
In The Mandalorian, they did like the AI thing where they like de-aged Luke Skywalker in The Mandalorian.

2207
01:21:57,230 --> 01:22:00,850
And then it just looks so fucking weird.

2208
01:22:00,850 --> 01:22:03,590
But they got an impersonator.

2209
01:22:03,970 --> 01:22:06,650
Yeah, they de-faked Luke.

2210
01:22:06,950 --> 01:22:10,650
But they also spent money on a body double.

2211
01:22:10,990 --> 01:22:17,890
And the body double looked more like Luke than the de-fake of Luke.

2212
01:22:18,290 --> 01:22:19,650
So I was like...

2213
01:22:20,710 --> 01:22:22,450
So confused.

2214
01:22:22,450 --> 01:22:27,870
I was like, why didn't you just use the body double?

2215
01:22:28,550 --> 01:22:30,770
It looked just like him.

2216
01:22:33,070 --> 01:22:34,110
It's just...

2217
01:22:34,110 --> 01:22:36,410
It was so...

2218
01:22:36,410 --> 01:22:37,110
Weird.

2219
01:22:39,550 --> 01:22:40,590
The guy...

2220
01:22:40,590 --> 01:22:41,950
Like, literally think that...

2221
01:22:41,950 --> 01:22:43,010
Okay, I'm gonna...

2222
01:22:43,010 --> 01:22:43,750
I'm gonna try you guys.

2223
01:22:43,870 --> 01:22:44,330
I saw it.

2224
01:22:44,410 --> 01:22:45,890
I was like, he looks just like him.

2225
01:22:45,970 --> 01:22:47,650
Why did you de-fake him?

2226
01:22:47,650 --> 01:22:49,430
I don't understand.

2227
01:22:50,090 --> 01:22:50,870
It was...

2228
01:22:50,870 --> 01:22:51,750
It's just...

2229
01:22:51,750 --> 01:22:53,190
It was weird.

2230
01:22:57,370 --> 01:22:57,770
Like...

2231
01:22:59,830 --> 01:23:01,070
Like, I...

2232
01:23:01,070 --> 01:23:02,050
I just...

2233
01:23:02,050 --> 01:23:03,090
I don't understand.

2234
01:23:07,950 --> 01:23:08,990
Let's see.

2235
01:23:09,370 --> 01:23:12,910
Like, yeah, his eyes might not be as big.

2236
01:23:12,910 --> 01:23:14,830
But, like...

2237
01:23:14,830 --> 01:23:15,650
He...

2238
01:23:16,350 --> 01:23:17,550
At least...

2239
01:23:17,550 --> 01:23:20,570
At least it doesn't look unnatural.

2240
01:23:21,730 --> 01:23:22,330
Like...

2241
01:23:23,870 --> 01:23:25,370
Mark Hamill probably...

2242
01:23:25,370 --> 01:23:25,930
I don't know.

2243
01:23:26,370 --> 01:23:27,150
I don't know.

2244
01:23:27,390 --> 01:23:29,150
I don't know if Mark Hamill has a clause.

2245
01:23:29,330 --> 01:23:30,610
Has, like, the...

2246
01:23:30,610 --> 01:23:31,350
The...

2247
01:23:31,350 --> 01:23:32,030
The...

2248
01:23:32,030 --> 01:23:32,610
What's his name?

2249
01:23:32,670 --> 01:23:34,090
Dwayne the Rock Johnson clause.

2250
01:23:34,670 --> 01:23:36,250
Which word he can never lose.

2251
01:23:36,570 --> 01:23:37,990
That shit's fucking weird.

2252
01:23:40,810 --> 01:23:42,410
That shit's...

2253
01:23:42,410 --> 01:23:43,510
That shit's...

2254
01:23:43,510 --> 01:23:44,210
Like...

2255
01:23:44,210 --> 01:23:45,250
You can see...

2256
01:23:45,250 --> 01:23:45,570
Okay.

2257
01:23:45,910 --> 01:23:48,930
I think it's funny that, like...

2258
01:23:48,930 --> 01:23:49,310
Look...

2259
01:23:49,310 --> 01:23:50,770
Like, I don't understand!

2260
01:23:51,730 --> 01:23:52,850
I don't...

2261
01:23:52,850 --> 01:23:54,490
I don't understand!

2262
01:23:55,510 --> 01:23:58,970
Why do you need to de-fake this?

2263
01:23:59,610 --> 01:24:00,170
I...

2264
01:24:00,170 --> 01:24:02,270
Just edit it a little bit!

2265
01:24:04,810 --> 01:24:05,610
Alright.

2266
01:24:06,030 --> 01:24:06,870
Here you go.

2267
01:24:06,870 --> 01:24:08,210
Let me show you guys.

2268
01:24:09,290 --> 01:24:10,010
Like...

2269
01:24:10,810 --> 01:24:11,530
Yes!

2270
01:24:11,890 --> 01:24:13,750
This just makes it more expensive!

2271
01:24:14,430 --> 01:24:14,930
This...

2272
01:24:16,990 --> 01:24:17,710
Like...

2273
01:24:17,710 --> 01:24:18,470
Like...

2274
01:24:18,470 --> 01:24:19,890
I feel like you're just...

2275
01:24:19,890 --> 01:24:21,730
Making it more expensive.

2276
01:24:22,690 --> 01:24:23,270
I...

2277
01:24:25,370 --> 01:24:27,490
Yo, and then they de-faked him.

2278
01:24:27,710 --> 01:24:28,330
Right after.

2279
01:24:28,830 --> 01:24:29,450
Just...

2280
01:24:29,450 --> 01:24:30,130
Makeup!

2281
01:24:30,630 --> 01:24:31,290
Just...

2282
01:24:31,290 --> 01:24:32,730
Just do makeup!

2283
01:24:33,090 --> 01:24:34,890
Guess which one's the de-fake?

2284
01:24:34,890 --> 01:24:35,230
Like...

2285
01:24:35,230 --> 01:24:39,010
The answer might not surprise you!

2286
01:24:39,570 --> 01:24:39,870
The...

2287
01:24:44,450 --> 01:24:45,130
Yeah!

2288
01:24:45,410 --> 01:24:45,490
Yeah!

2289
01:24:45,750 --> 01:24:46,130
Because...

2290
01:24:46,130 --> 01:24:46,870
You know why...

2291
01:24:46,870 --> 01:24:47,710
How...

2292
01:24:47,710 --> 01:24:49,070
You know why...

2293
01:24:49,070 --> 01:24:50,230
De-fakes never work?

2294
01:24:50,410 --> 01:24:51,270
It's because like...

2295
01:24:51,270 --> 01:24:52,490
Maybe eventually it will.

2296
01:24:52,610 --> 01:24:53,910
Because technology evolves.

2297
01:24:55,530 --> 01:24:56,210
Um...

2298
01:24:56,210 --> 01:24:57,010
Um...

2299
01:24:57,010 --> 01:24:57,870
But it's because...

2300
01:24:57,870 --> 01:24:59,670
Deep fakes and AI...

2301
01:24:59,670 --> 01:25:01,170
Can never get lighting correct.

2302
01:25:01,650 --> 01:25:03,130
Because lighting is one of like...

2303
01:25:03,130 --> 01:25:04,170
The hardest things...

2304
01:25:04,170 --> 01:25:05,110
To get correct.

2305
01:25:05,450 --> 01:25:06,950
And the reason why...

2306
01:25:06,950 --> 01:25:07,570
Like...

2307
01:25:07,570 --> 01:25:08,330
Um...

2308
01:25:08,330 --> 01:25:08,810
The reason...

2309
01:25:08,810 --> 01:25:09,630
I also know a lot of this...

2310
01:25:09,630 --> 01:25:11,510
Because I used to watch Corridor Digital a lot.

2311
01:25:11,750 --> 01:25:12,850
But that's like...

2312
01:25:12,850 --> 01:25:14,070
What makes it uncanny.

2313
01:25:14,190 --> 01:25:14,810
It's because...

2314
01:25:14,810 --> 01:25:16,130
It's so hard...

2315
01:25:16,130 --> 01:25:17,670
To get realistic lighting.

2316
01:25:17,670 --> 01:25:19,390
But also because...

2317
01:25:20,430 --> 01:25:20,990
Studios...

2318
01:25:20,990 --> 01:25:22,990
Do not give 3D artists...

2319
01:25:22,990 --> 01:25:23,610
Or like...

2320
01:25:23,610 --> 01:25:24,010
Um...

2321
01:25:24,010 --> 01:25:25,430
Special effects artists...

2322
01:25:25,430 --> 01:25:26,670
Enough time...

2323
01:25:26,670 --> 01:25:28,070
To recreate...

2324
01:25:28,070 --> 01:25:28,690
Like...

2325
01:25:28,690 --> 01:25:29,410
Real lighting.

2326
01:25:29,870 --> 01:25:30,370
Um...

2327
01:25:30,370 --> 01:25:31,130
You can say like...

2328
01:25:31,130 --> 01:25:31,910
Well that's not true.

2329
01:25:31,950 --> 01:25:33,510
In Pirates of the Caribbean...

2330
01:25:33,510 --> 01:25:34,470
Um...

2331
01:25:34,470 --> 01:25:36,390
They were able to do so many things...

2332
01:25:36,390 --> 01:25:37,330
With special effects.

2333
01:25:37,550 --> 01:25:38,810
Like Davy Jones...

2334
01:25:38,810 --> 01:25:40,050
And like his ship and everything.

2335
01:25:40,370 --> 01:25:41,170
And the light...

2336
01:25:41,170 --> 01:25:42,790
And none of it ever looked uncanny.

2337
01:25:42,970 --> 01:25:44,810
But do you know how many years...

2338
01:25:44,810 --> 01:25:47,250
They spent on Pirates of the Caribbean...

2339
01:25:47,250 --> 01:25:49,730
On that one fucking movie?

2340
01:25:50,450 --> 01:25:51,050
Like...

2341
01:25:51,050 --> 01:25:52,550
Ha ha ha ha ha ha...

2342
01:25:52,550 --> 01:25:53,670
That shit...

2343
01:25:53,670 --> 01:25:55,010
They had like...

2344
01:25:55,010 --> 01:25:57,270
So much time...

2345
01:25:57,270 --> 01:25:59,050
To actually like...

2346
01:25:59,050 --> 01:25:59,670
Um...

2347
01:25:59,670 --> 01:26:00,530
Make that work.

2348
01:26:00,770 --> 01:26:01,910
But nowadays...

2349
01:26:01,910 --> 01:26:04,410
Like a lot of special effects movies...

2350
01:26:04,410 --> 01:26:04,710
Um...

2351
01:26:04,710 --> 01:26:06,030
Special effects and movies...

2352
01:26:06,030 --> 01:26:07,290
They make them be like...

2353
01:26:07,290 --> 01:26:08,970
We need this done by...

2354
01:26:08,970 --> 01:26:09,290
Like...

2355
01:26:09,290 --> 01:26:10,570
We need this done in like...

2356
01:26:10,570 --> 01:26:11,030
3 months.

2357
01:26:11,110 --> 01:26:12,810
So we can get it released during Christmas.

2358
01:26:13,310 --> 01:26:13,910
So...

2359
01:26:13,910 --> 01:26:14,470
Um...

2360
01:26:14,470 --> 01:26:15,410
So that's why...

2361
01:26:15,410 --> 01:26:16,410
Everything looks...

2362
01:26:16,410 --> 01:26:16,830
A lot...

2363
01:26:16,830 --> 01:26:17,810
That's why you can tell like...

2364
01:26:17,810 --> 01:26:18,690
Special effects...

2365
01:26:18,690 --> 01:26:20,170
Have gotten worse...

2366
01:26:20,170 --> 01:26:20,850
Over the years.

2367
01:26:21,130 --> 01:26:23,310
Because we're not given enough time...

2368
01:26:23,310 --> 01:26:23,890
To like...

2369
01:26:23,890 --> 01:26:24,970
Create...

2370
01:26:25,950 --> 01:26:26,490
Um...

2371
01:26:26,490 --> 01:26:27,970
To create...

2372
01:26:27,970 --> 01:26:28,090
The...

2373
01:26:28,090 --> 01:26:29,670
Create the things that they want to make.

2374
01:26:29,870 --> 01:26:30,610
And so like...

2375
01:26:30,610 --> 01:26:32,130
People are just going through crunch time.

2376
01:26:32,290 --> 01:26:32,590
I mean...

2377
01:26:32,590 --> 01:26:33,670
This looks fucking garbage.

2378
01:26:33,950 --> 01:26:34,350
Ha ha ha ha ha!

2379
01:26:34,370 --> 01:26:34,810
I was like...

2380
01:26:34,810 --> 01:26:35,650
I don't understand!

2381
01:26:36,010 --> 01:26:37,790
The body double looked fine!

2382
01:26:38,150 --> 01:26:39,690
It's just his eyes!

2383
01:26:40,110 --> 01:26:41,550
Which you can like...

2384
01:26:41,550 --> 01:26:42,850
Put makeup on...

2385
01:26:42,850 --> 01:26:44,250
And make them pop out more.

2386
01:26:44,470 --> 01:26:47,410
It's literally just his eyes that make it like...

2387
01:26:47,410 --> 01:26:48,090
He's not...

2388
01:26:48,090 --> 01:26:49,910
Doesn't look like Luke in a way...

2389
01:26:49,910 --> 01:26:50,270
But...

2390
01:26:50,270 --> 01:26:51,710
That can be fixed.

2391
01:26:52,110 --> 01:26:52,610
That...

2392
01:26:52,610 --> 01:26:53,730
Ha ha ha ha!

2393
01:26:54,450 --> 01:26:55,370
Ha ha ha!

2394
01:26:55,730 --> 01:26:55,850
Ha ha ha!

2395
01:26:55,850 --> 01:26:55,950
Ha ha ha!

2396
01:26:55,950 --> 01:26:56,310
No!

2397
01:26:56,650 --> 01:26:58,350
You know what was the worst one?

2398
01:26:58,570 --> 01:27:00,790
The worst one was the...

2399
01:27:00,790 --> 01:27:01,970
Was the...

2400
01:27:01,970 --> 01:27:03,870
The scene I saw...

2401
01:27:03,870 --> 01:27:05,490
In Black Panther...

2402
01:27:05,490 --> 01:27:06,610
I never watched the...

2403
01:27:06,610 --> 01:27:06,910
Uh...

2404
01:27:06,910 --> 01:27:07,850
Black Panther movie...

2405
01:27:07,850 --> 01:27:09,470
Guys, I never watched a lot of Marvel...

2406
01:27:09,470 --> 01:27:10,650
Marvel movies...

2407
01:27:10,650 --> 01:27:12,790
But I haven't watched the Black Panther movie...

2408
01:27:12,790 --> 01:27:13,510
Where like...

2409
01:27:13,510 --> 01:27:14,630
There was a fight scene...

2410
01:27:14,630 --> 01:27:15,670
That you could tell...

2411
01:27:15,670 --> 01:27:16,870
The CGI...

2412
01:27:16,870 --> 01:27:17,810
Was like...

2413
01:27:17,810 --> 01:27:19,170
Not the greatest...

2414
01:27:19,170 --> 01:27:20,090
I don't know which movie...

2415
01:27:20,090 --> 01:27:21,170
I don't know if it was the first one...

2416
01:27:21,170 --> 01:27:22,210
Or the second one...

2417
01:27:22,210 --> 01:27:23,290
But like...

2418
01:27:24,510 --> 01:27:24,950
Um...

2419
01:27:24,950 --> 01:27:26,450
But it was like...

2420
01:27:26,450 --> 01:27:27,610
Where there was like...

2421
01:27:27,610 --> 01:27:28,410
There was a...

2422
01:27:28,410 --> 01:27:30,270
I saw it in the Corridor Digital...

2423
01:27:30,270 --> 01:27:30,750
Movie...

2424
01:27:30,750 --> 01:27:31,430
Not movie...

2425
01:27:31,430 --> 01:27:33,290
I saw it on Corridor Digital...

2426
01:27:33,290 --> 01:27:34,450
Where they were showing it...

2427
01:27:34,450 --> 01:27:35,070
And I was like...

2428
01:27:35,070 --> 01:27:37,250
What the fuck was the CGI?

2429
01:27:38,350 --> 01:27:39,750
Ha ha ha ha!

2430
01:27:40,170 --> 01:27:40,630
Ha ha ha!

2431
01:27:40,630 --> 01:27:41,170
Ha ha ha!

2432
01:27:41,350 --> 01:27:42,350
I was like...

2433
01:27:42,350 --> 01:27:43,650
I saw the CGI!

2434
01:27:44,210 --> 01:27:45,770
And then they fixed it...

2435
01:27:45,770 --> 01:27:46,270
In the...

2436
01:27:46,270 --> 01:27:47,230
Apparently they...

2437
01:27:47,230 --> 01:27:49,870
They fixed it in the Blu-ray version...

2438
01:27:49,870 --> 01:27:50,530
So there's like...

2439
01:27:50,530 --> 01:27:51,970
A video comparison...

2440
01:27:51,970 --> 01:27:52,770
Of like...

2441
01:27:52,770 --> 01:27:53,730
The Blu-ray...

2442
01:27:53,730 --> 01:28:01,170
Of the Black Panther edition where they fixed the CGI versus the original with the... Wait, let me see if I can find it.

2443
01:28:01,650 --> 01:28:05,050
Black Panther fight scene CGI.

2444
01:28:06,450 --> 01:28:07,770
Let's see if I can find it.

2445
01:28:07,830 --> 01:28:08,550
It was crazy.

2446
01:28:08,590 --> 01:28:12,270
I was like, what the... Oh my god!

2447
01:28:12,630 --> 01:28:22,200
Oh, it looks just as bad as... Okay, for those who are curious, this is what it used to look like.

2448
01:28:22,760 --> 01:28:25,540
I couldn't believe that was actually from the movie.

2449
01:28:25,680 --> 01:28:28,520
It looks like... You know what this reminds me of?

2450
01:28:28,640 --> 01:28:30,880
It looks like a PlayStation 2 cutscene.

2451
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,360
It looks like...

2452
01:28:36,550 --> 01:28:40,750
It looks like a PlayStation 2 cutscene.

2453
01:28:41,170 --> 01:28:43,250
Like, I can't... Yes, that's it!

2454
01:28:44,050 --> 01:28:45,410
You're right!

2455
01:28:49,130 --> 01:28:51,430
Oh, that's bad!

2456
01:28:52,270 --> 01:28:52,610
Yeah.

2457
01:28:54,550 --> 01:28:57,150
That is very generous.

2458
01:28:57,150 --> 01:29:00,650
Why didn't... But this was in Black Panther.

2459
01:29:01,030 --> 01:29:02,450
It's so bad!

2460
01:29:06,230 --> 01:29:09,350
But that was like... And then, um...

2461
01:29:11,110 --> 01:29:14,230
They were saying that... Oh wait, here's a better clip of it.

2462
01:29:14,570 --> 01:29:15,690
Here's a...

2463
01:29:16,350 --> 01:29:18,950
Here's a better clip of the fight scene.

2464
01:29:19,270 --> 01:29:19,730
Here.

2465
01:29:19,730 --> 01:29:21,870
It's just... Why are they so shiny?

2466
01:29:22,250 --> 01:29:23,670
I don't understand!

2467
01:29:24,750 --> 01:29:30,550
Why... I love this Black Panther PS2 coming out in 2020 December.

2468
01:29:31,090 --> 01:29:35,790
Wow, what is this game coming out for PlayStation 2?

2469
01:29:39,750 --> 01:29:41,270
Like, I'm like...

2470
01:29:41,270 --> 01:29:43,730
Why are they so fucking shiny?

2471
01:29:44,190 --> 01:29:45,970
I... I don't understand!

2472
01:29:47,050 --> 01:29:48,170
Um... Anyway...

2473
01:29:48,170 --> 01:29:49,350
So they got like...

2474
01:29:49,350 --> 01:29:50,850
They... In Corridor Digital...

2475
01:29:50,850 --> 01:29:54,450
They got like... I don't watch Corridor Digital anymore because they got...

2476
01:29:54,450 --> 01:29:59,250
I don't know... I just... I don't think I just... I... I wasn't as interested in the kind of content they were making anymore.

2477
01:30:00,090 --> 01:30:03,130
Um... But... Um... They had a series where it was like...

2478
01:30:03,130 --> 01:30:04,490
Special... CGI...

2479
01:30:04,490 --> 01:30:06,030
Effects... Special Effects...

2480
01:30:06,030 --> 01:30:06,870
Reacts...

2481
01:30:06,870 --> 01:30:08,530
Where like... They get like...

2482
01:30:08,530 --> 01:30:09,790
Um... Actual...

2483
01:30:09,790 --> 01:30:12,490
They get like... Actual like... CGI people...

2484
01:30:12,490 --> 01:30:14,010
Who worked on big movies.

2485
01:30:14,650 --> 01:30:16,790
Um... Yeah... VFX React... Yeah...

2486
01:30:16,790 --> 01:30:19,210
They did like... VFX... VFX...

2487
01:30:19,210 --> 01:30:19,690
Reacts...

2488
01:30:19,690 --> 01:30:22,170
Where they get like... People who worked on these movies...

2489
01:30:22,170 --> 01:30:23,250
To talk about...

2490
01:30:23,250 --> 01:30:24,150
How it happened.

2491
01:30:24,410 --> 01:30:26,210
And then the guy was just like...

2492
01:30:26,210 --> 01:30:27,830
We were not giving enough time.

2493
01:30:27,830 --> 01:30:30,750
And he was just like, yeah.

2494
01:30:31,670 --> 01:30:37,110
They said we have to complete this video, this movie by X amount of days.

2495
01:30:37,590 --> 01:30:40,990
And yeah, we did not have enough time.

2496
01:30:44,970 --> 01:30:48,050
Oh, don't get me started on Lilo and Stitch.

2497
01:30:48,230 --> 01:30:49,150
I was so sad.

2498
01:30:49,610 --> 01:30:51,650
They got rid of Jumba.

2499
01:30:51,730 --> 01:30:52,890
Who they got rid of?

2500
01:30:54,150 --> 01:30:56,430
They got rid of... Not Jumba.

2501
01:30:56,550 --> 01:30:58,150
They got rid of... Oh my god.

2502
01:30:59,850 --> 01:31:02,370
They got rid of... God, what was his name?

2503
01:31:02,730 --> 01:31:04,790
His name is like... Captain Gontu.

2504
01:31:05,030 --> 01:31:08,590
Captain Gontu is... He's the main villain.

2505
01:31:09,750 --> 01:31:12,030
Also, John, welcome to Tomato Farm.

2506
01:31:12,170 --> 01:31:12,730
Welcome, welcome.

2507
01:31:13,170 --> 01:31:17,050
They got rid of Captain Gontu, the shark guy.

2508
01:31:17,650 --> 01:31:20,550
They got rid of... I was so confused.

2509
01:31:21,090 --> 01:31:22,430
I was like...

2510
01:31:22,430 --> 01:31:23,870
I don't understand.

2511
01:31:23,890 --> 01:31:24,750
No, they did.

2512
01:31:24,890 --> 01:31:26,450
They removed him and...

2513
01:31:27,470 --> 01:31:28,990
They removed him.

2514
01:31:29,310 --> 01:31:33,890
The main villain, by the way, from the live-action movie.

2515
01:31:33,890 --> 01:31:36,650
I was so fucking confused about it.

2516
01:31:37,510 --> 01:31:39,570
And... Because like, they just recently announced it.

2517
01:31:39,650 --> 01:31:42,610
Also, like, Jumba and Pleakley are so ugly.

2518
01:31:42,750 --> 01:31:43,190
I'm sorry.

2519
01:31:43,250 --> 01:31:44,110
I need to show you guys.

2520
01:31:44,110 --> 01:31:44,930
Um...

2521
01:31:44,930 --> 01:31:46,110
I'm sorry.

2522
01:31:46,630 --> 01:31:48,750
By the way, um...

2523
01:31:48,750 --> 01:31:50,490
Trigger warning for what they look like.

2524
01:31:56,410 --> 01:31:58,470
They're so fucking ugly.

2525
01:31:58,910 --> 01:32:00,730
Trigger warning for what...

2526
01:32:00,730 --> 01:32:04,730
What does Jumba and Pleakly look like in the live action?

2527
01:32:05,010 --> 01:32:07,750
Like, what are you trick- what's the warning?

2528
01:32:08,290 --> 01:32:09,070
Everything.

2529
01:32:09,470 --> 01:32:10,690
That's just it.

2530
01:32:15,910 --> 01:32:17,610
Oh my god.

2531
01:32:18,090 --> 01:32:18,990
What place?

2532
01:32:19,330 --> 01:32:20,050
No way.

2533
01:32:24,540 --> 01:32:25,690
Jumba and Pleakly.

2534
01:32:25,890 --> 01:32:29,870
But the thing that made me so sad...

2535
01:32:29,870 --> 01:32:31,070
Is that...

2536
01:32:32,030 --> 01:32:34,750
Pleakly doesn't cross-dress anymore.

2537
01:32:40,490 --> 01:32:43,270
Okay, they- okay, so...

2538
01:32:43,650 --> 01:32:45,210
So there's like...

2539
01:32:45,730 --> 01:32:46,570
So...

2540
01:32:46,570 --> 01:32:52,890
I was so sad because you know like the whole days they wear like really stupid disguises.

2541
01:32:53,250 --> 01:32:56,170
And everything to like fit into the...

2542
01:32:56,390 --> 01:32:59,350
Fit into like the human world.

2543
01:32:59,870 --> 01:33:00,850
But instead...

2544
01:33:00,850 --> 01:33:03,550
What I was so sad was that...

2545
01:33:03,550 --> 01:33:04,310
Like...

2546
01:33:04,870 --> 01:33:05,330
Um...

2547
01:33:06,600 --> 01:33:08,450
Yeah, they cut out the costumes.

2548
01:33:08,710 --> 01:33:09,970
So instead...

2549
01:33:09,970 --> 01:33:11,180
They do like...

2550
01:33:11,530 --> 01:33:12,070
Like...

2551
01:33:12,070 --> 01:33:12,930
Human...

2552
01:33:13,850 --> 01:33:14,280
Holograms.

2553
01:33:14,280 --> 01:33:16,040
And I was like...

2554
01:33:16,040 --> 01:33:16,080
Boo!

2555
01:33:21,870 --> 01:33:22,390
Boo!

2556
01:33:28,310 --> 01:33:30,010
So now they're like the...

2557
01:33:30,010 --> 01:33:32,390
It's like the men in black...

2558
01:33:32,390 --> 01:33:33,370
Um...

2559
01:33:33,370 --> 01:33:35,570
You know, disguises that they do for aliens.

2560
01:33:35,970 --> 01:33:36,770
And I'm just...

2561
01:33:36,770 --> 01:33:38,750
I'm just a little sad because like it...

2562
01:33:38,750 --> 01:33:40,850
You know, it was so iconic, you know?

2563
01:33:40,850 --> 01:33:42,130
Give us...

2564
01:33:42,130 --> 01:33:44,990
Give us a cross-dressing alien!

2565
01:33:45,710 --> 01:33:46,010
Boo!

2566
01:33:46,290 --> 01:33:47,970
She was slay!

2567
01:33:50,530 --> 01:33:56,110
She bleakly walked so RuPaul's Drag Race could run!

2568
01:33:56,830 --> 01:33:57,090
Boo!

2569
01:34:01,790 --> 01:34:02,390
Shame!

2570
01:34:02,390 --> 01:34:05,130
I was like...

2571
01:34:05,130 --> 01:34:05,150
Shame!

2572
01:34:05,150 --> 01:34:05,510
I was like...

2573
01:34:07,650 --> 01:34:08,610
Um...

2574
01:34:09,130 --> 01:34:09,610
Um...

2575
01:34:09,610 --> 01:34:11,490
So true...

2576
01:34:11,490 --> 01:34:14,850
We want our diva pack!

2577
01:34:15,310 --> 01:34:17,750
I want girl boss...

2578
01:34:17,750 --> 01:34:18,290
Legally!

2579
01:34:18,930 --> 01:34:19,670
Um...

2580
01:34:19,670 --> 01:34:21,370
But yeah, so...

2581
01:34:21,370 --> 01:34:22,310
I was like...

2582
01:34:22,310 --> 01:34:23,010
I just thought...

2583
01:34:23,010 --> 01:34:24,250
I think it was funny...

2584
01:34:24,730 --> 01:34:26,290
That like...

2585
01:34:26,290 --> 01:34:27,030
Um...

2586
01:34:27,030 --> 01:34:29,130
I thought it was funny that...

2587
01:34:29,130 --> 01:34:29,830
You know...

2588
01:34:29,830 --> 01:34:32,010
The whole thing about their disguises...

2589
01:34:32,630 --> 01:34:34,970
Was that it was so bad...

2590
01:34:34,970 --> 01:34:36,670
But it still worked.

2591
01:34:36,990 --> 01:34:37,530
Like...

2592
01:34:37,530 --> 01:34:38,750
That's the silly part.

2593
01:34:38,930 --> 01:34:42,090
But now they're actually doing like the men in black...

2594
01:34:42,090 --> 01:34:42,690
Like...

2595
01:34:42,690 --> 01:34:44,310
Costumes and stuff.

2596
01:34:44,450 --> 01:34:45,390
So they're like...

2597
01:34:45,390 --> 01:34:46,450
Um...

2598
01:34:46,450 --> 01:34:48,270
So like they're more realistic.

2599
01:34:48,630 --> 01:34:49,170
But it...

2600
01:34:49,170 --> 01:34:50,710
That's what's what made it funny.

2601
01:34:50,850 --> 01:34:51,270
It was like...

2602
01:34:51,270 --> 01:34:52,730
How did these disguises work?

2603
01:34:52,910 --> 01:34:53,490
It's so bad.

2604
01:34:53,790 --> 01:34:54,290
To be fair...

2605
01:34:54,290 --> 01:34:56,290
Their alien forms are really fucking ugly though.

2606
01:34:59,270 --> 01:34:59,850
Like...

2607
01:34:59,850 --> 01:35:00,570
Like...

2608
01:35:00,570 --> 01:35:01,770
To be fair...

2609
01:35:01,770 --> 01:35:02,950
This is not...

2610
01:35:02,950 --> 01:35:04,470
I don't wanna look at this.

2611
01:35:04,610 --> 01:35:05,300
To be fair...

2612
01:35:05,850 --> 01:35:06,270
I...

2613
01:35:07,050 --> 01:35:08,210
I don't...

2614
01:35:08,210 --> 01:35:10,270
I don't wanna look at it.

2615
01:35:10,530 --> 01:35:11,170
So I don't...

2616
01:35:11,170 --> 01:35:13,480
Maybe it was a good choice...

2617
01:35:13,950 --> 01:35:16,690
That they decided to make them more human?

2618
01:35:16,690 --> 01:35:17,410
No!

2619
01:35:18,710 --> 01:35:19,350
Yeah!

2620
01:35:22,500 --> 01:35:23,570
Put it away!

2621
01:35:24,890 --> 01:35:27,050
There was concept art of their cut human...

2622
01:35:27,050 --> 01:35:27,810
Oh, was there?

2623
01:35:28,070 --> 01:35:28,250
Wait!

2624
01:35:28,850 --> 01:35:29,550
Lila...

2625
01:35:29,550 --> 01:35:31,170
And Stitch...

2626
01:35:31,170 --> 01:35:33,730
Live action concept art...

2627
01:35:33,730 --> 01:35:34,710
Human...

2628
01:35:35,490 --> 01:35:36,190
Disguise...

2629
01:35:36,190 --> 01:35:37,610
I'm typing so much for...

2630
01:35:37,610 --> 01:35:38,130
Oh my god!

2631
01:35:38,210 --> 01:35:38,970
I see it!

2632
01:35:40,350 --> 01:35:41,650
Oh my god!

2633
01:35:43,610 --> 01:35:43,950
Slay!

2634
01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:55,480
Slay...

2635
01:35:56,380 --> 01:35:57,060
Um...

2636
01:35:57,060 --> 01:35:57,760
But yeah...

2637
01:35:57,760 --> 01:35:58,900
I don't know...

2638
01:35:58,900 --> 01:36:00,180
Apparently they were like...

2639
01:36:00,180 --> 01:36:00,600
Not...

2640
01:36:00,600 --> 01:36:01,860
They wanna see what...

2641
01:36:02,920 --> 01:36:03,380
If...

2642
01:36:03,380 --> 01:36:04,860
Lila and Stitch is like...

2643
01:36:04,860 --> 01:36:05,620
Their last...

2644
01:36:05,620 --> 01:36:07,100
Live action...

2645
01:36:07,100 --> 01:36:08,600
So if it bombs...

2646
01:36:08,600 --> 01:36:10,160
They're never doing live action again...

2647
01:36:10,160 --> 01:36:11,460
Because Snow White did...

2648
01:36:11,460 --> 01:36:12,840
So terribly...

2649
01:36:12,840 --> 01:36:13,560
Hello...

2650
01:36:13,560 --> 01:36:13,700
No!

2651
01:36:15,400 --> 01:36:16,800
Okay, but like...

2652
01:36:19,580 --> 01:36:20,800
Okay, what was it?

2653
01:36:21,380 --> 01:36:21,820
Snow White...

2654
01:36:23,260 --> 01:36:23,860
Line...

2655
01:36:25,340 --> 01:36:27,800
I fucking love that line...

2656
01:36:27,800 --> 01:36:28,840
I fucking love that...

2657
01:36:28,840 --> 01:36:29,240
I fucking love that...

2658
01:36:29,240 --> 01:36:29,720
Video...

2659
01:36:30,860 --> 01:36:31,460
Uh...

2660
01:36:33,900 --> 01:36:34,500
Gee...

2661
01:36:34,500 --> 01:36:36,100
They were saying that like...

2662
01:36:36,100 --> 01:36:37,840
Snow White did so fucking poorly...

2663
01:36:38,300 --> 01:36:39,700
That they do not wanna do...

2664
01:36:39,700 --> 01:36:41,600
Live action anymore...

2665
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:42,820
Okay, was it the evil...

2666
01:36:43,400 --> 01:36:44,000
Queen...

2667
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:44,820
Line...

2668
01:36:44,820 --> 01:36:46,360
I need to find that video!

2669
01:36:46,360 --> 01:36:48,560
It was so funny...

2670
01:36:49,360 --> 01:36:50,400
It was...

2671
01:36:50,400 --> 01:36:52,360
It was so funny...

2672
01:36:52,900 --> 01:36:53,380
When...

2673
01:36:53,380 --> 01:36:55,040
When she was in that...

2674
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:56,100
Um...

2675
01:36:56,100 --> 01:36:56,540
Okay...

2676
01:36:56,540 --> 01:36:56,960
What was it?

2677
01:36:57,060 --> 01:36:57,920
Gal...

2678
01:36:57,920 --> 01:36:58,360
Go...

2679
01:36:58,360 --> 01:36:59,360
That...

2680
01:36:59,360 --> 01:37:00,920
Snow White...

2681
01:37:00,920 --> 01:37:01,360
Line...

2682
01:37:01,360 --> 01:37:02,940
I should've bookmarked it...

2683
01:37:02,940 --> 01:37:04,360
Things that...

2684
01:37:04,360 --> 01:37:06,460
That makes me laugh...

2685
01:37:08,740 --> 01:37:09,660
No, no...

2686
01:37:09,660 --> 01:37:10,700
There was a...

2687
01:37:10,700 --> 01:37:11,860
There was a...

2688
01:37:11,860 --> 01:37:12,500
Funnier...

2689
01:37:12,500 --> 01:37:13,280
There was an...

2690
01:37:13,280 --> 01:37:14,720
Even funnier line...

2691
01:37:14,720 --> 01:37:15,540
From...

2692
01:37:15,540 --> 01:37:16,900
Gal Gadot...

2693
01:37:16,900 --> 01:37:17,540
In...

2694
01:37:17,540 --> 01:37:18,280
Snow White...

2695
01:37:18,280 --> 01:37:20,480
Where she was in front of a mirror...

2696
01:37:20,480 --> 01:37:21,880
And she had to say a line...

2697
01:37:21,880 --> 01:37:22,820
And I was like...

2698
01:37:22,820 --> 01:37:23,940
Yes, girl!

2699
01:37:24,260 --> 01:37:25,900
Give me nothing!

2700
01:37:29,120 --> 01:37:30,260
Yes!

2701
01:37:31,320 --> 01:37:33,380
I love nothing!

2702
01:37:33,960 --> 01:37:35,580
Keep giving it to me!

2703
01:37:40,220 --> 01:37:41,780
I saw that...

2704
01:37:41,780 --> 01:37:42,660
One scene...

2705
01:37:42,660 --> 01:37:43,580
And I was like...

2706
01:37:45,320 --> 01:37:46,280
Jesus Christ...

2707
01:37:47,900 --> 01:37:49,440
I can't see no fire...

2708
01:37:49,440 --> 01:37:50,940
And I'm like looking on Twitter...

2709
01:37:50,940 --> 01:37:52,240
It's like she was in like...

2710
01:37:52,240 --> 01:37:53,040
A mirror...

2711
01:37:53,040 --> 01:37:54,380
Like not the magic mirror...

2712
01:37:54,380 --> 01:37:56,160
She was like sitting on a counter...

2713
01:37:56,160 --> 01:37:57,740
And then she said a line...

2714
01:37:57,740 --> 01:37:58,280
And then...

2715
01:37:58,280 --> 01:37:58,520
Yes!

2716
01:37:58,700 --> 01:37:59,500
Give us less!

2717
01:38:00,200 --> 01:38:00,620
Haha!

2718
01:38:00,960 --> 01:38:01,640
Come on!

2719
01:38:02,180 --> 01:38:02,880
You can...

2720
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:04,860
You can always give me less!

2721
01:38:05,480 --> 01:38:06,680
You always...

2722
01:38:06,680 --> 01:38:07,580
You always...

2723
01:38:08,260 --> 01:38:08,740
Make...

2724
01:38:08,740 --> 01:38:09,600
Give me less!

2725
01:38:10,260 --> 01:38:11,760
Alright, let's see...

2726
01:38:12,380 --> 01:38:13,560
And I remember the...

2727
01:38:13,560 --> 01:38:14,420
The tweet was like...

2728
01:38:14,420 --> 01:38:15,200
How did the...

2729
01:38:15,200 --> 01:38:16,780
Background actor...

2730
01:38:16,780 --> 01:38:17,460
Like...

2731
01:38:17,460 --> 01:38:19,640
How is the background actor...

2732
01:38:19,640 --> 01:38:21,520
Able to like...

2733
01:38:21,520 --> 01:38:23,000
Not react to this?

2734
01:38:26,400 --> 01:38:27,000
learns!

2735
01:38:27,040 --> 01:38:27,640
Hahahaha!

2736
01:38:29,020 --> 01:38:29,620
Aaaah!

2737
01:38:29,640 --> 01:38:30,140
Okay, wait.

2738
01:38:30,240 --> 01:38:31,120
I'll let you guys hear this.

2739
01:38:31,780 --> 01:38:32,720
Wieher, okay hear this!

2740
01:38:32,940 --> 01:38:34,040
This is like...

2741
01:38:34,040 --> 01:38:35,380
A compilation...

2742
01:38:35,380 --> 01:38:36,240
Of like...

2743
01:38:36,240 --> 01:38:37,220
Her worst...

2744
01:38:37,220 --> 01:38:37,740
Voice...

2745
01:38:37,740 --> 01:38:38,080
uh...

2746
01:38:38,080 --> 01:38:38,780
Her worst acting!

2747
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:51,600
Kaleel...

2748
01:38:55,700 --> 01:38:57,760
I Oh my god.

2749
01:38:58,280 --> 01:38:59,180
Fuck it.

2750
01:39:00,280 --> 01:39:01,080
Okay, wait.

2751
01:39:01,600 --> 01:39:02,500
Oh, there we go.

2752
01:39:02,820 --> 01:39:03,100
There we go.

2753
01:39:03,180 --> 01:39:03,680
I found it.

2754
01:39:03,920 --> 01:39:04,500
Here we go.

2755
01:39:04,760 --> 01:39:05,320
Champagne.

2756
01:39:06,060 --> 01:39:07,280
To fill the Nile.

2757
01:39:08,080 --> 01:39:08,940
Kaleel, no.

2758
01:39:09,640 --> 01:39:14,240
Next Lord, you're putting yourself and everyone else in grave danger.

2759
01:39:14,500 --> 01:39:16,280
I need you to give me the stone.

2760
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:17,840
What happened to it?

2761
01:39:17,960 --> 01:39:19,060
What did you say?

2762
01:39:20,760 --> 01:39:21,880
So exciting.

2763
01:39:23,400 --> 01:39:26,100
Very interested to find the man who bought those.

2764
01:39:26,300 --> 01:39:27,240
Why should I help you?

2765
01:39:27,340 --> 01:39:28,660
Because we're asking you nicely.

2766
01:39:28,960 --> 01:39:31,200
Just tell me what it costs to get away from me.

2767
01:39:31,440 --> 01:39:32,240
Name a price.

2768
01:39:32,880 --> 01:39:34,380
I'll buy the whole damn boat if I have to.

2769
01:39:34,760 --> 01:39:35,360
Who are you?

2770
01:39:36,240 --> 01:39:38,080
The last of... Yes, queen!

2771
01:39:39,020 --> 01:39:40,420
Give us nothing!

2772
01:39:42,400 --> 01:39:42,960
But who?

2773
01:39:45,100 --> 01:39:45,440
Enough.

2774
01:39:45,860 --> 01:39:47,840
I said enough as Anna...

2775
01:39:49,580 --> 01:39:50,060
Enough.

2776
01:39:50,860 --> 01:39:52,300
I said enough.

2777
01:39:53,420 --> 01:39:54,720
Bro, what the fuck?

2778
01:39:55,180 --> 01:39:56,640
This is our duty.

2779
01:39:56,860 --> 01:39:59,040
You have no idea what kind of power you're doing.

2780
01:39:59,420 --> 01:40:03,280
Enough champagne to fill the Nile.

2781
01:40:03,500 --> 01:40:05,080
Where the fuck is that from?

2782
01:40:05,360 --> 01:40:06,420
I need to know.

2783
01:40:06,420 --> 01:40:09,640
Enough champagne to fill the Nile.

2784
01:40:10,060 --> 01:40:11,500
Enough champagne to fill the Nile.

2785
01:40:11,500 --> 01:40:13,780
What the fuck is this movie?

2786
01:40:14,080 --> 01:40:15,500
Death on the Nile?

2787
01:40:16,180 --> 01:40:16,340
Alright.

2788
01:40:18,020 --> 01:40:19,700
Death on the Nile.

2789
01:40:19,840 --> 01:40:20,060
Okay.

2790
01:40:21,220 --> 01:40:22,560
Box office.

2791
01:40:23,320 --> 01:40:23,380
How?

2792
01:40:23,560 --> 01:40:23,980
Okay, wait.

2793
01:40:24,160 --> 01:40:24,520
Budget.

2794
01:40:24,780 --> 01:40:24,940
No.

2795
01:40:25,420 --> 01:40:26,000
Budget.

2796
01:40:28,220 --> 01:40:29,520
Enough champagne.

2797
01:40:29,520 --> 01:40:34,220
It had a 90 million dollar bunch of...

2798
01:40:34,220 --> 01:40:35,360
Jesus Christ.

2799
01:40:36,120 --> 01:40:38,980
And no champagne to fill the Nile.

2800
01:40:43,840 --> 01:40:45,240
What was that?

2801
01:40:45,500 --> 01:40:46,300
Oh my god.

2802
01:40:46,400 --> 01:40:46,880
If I get...

2803
01:40:46,880 --> 01:40:49,080
If this stream gets DMCA'd, I'm sorry.

2804
01:40:49,720 --> 01:40:52,120
I had to play...

2805
01:40:52,120 --> 01:40:54,100
I had to play this...

2806
01:40:54,100 --> 01:40:55,040
Play it for you guys.

2807
01:40:55,340 --> 01:40:56,820
I had...

2808
01:40:56,820 --> 01:40:58,240
80 mil...

2809
01:40:58,240 --> 01:41:02,260
80 million dollars was for that one line delivery right there.

2810
01:41:02,600 --> 01:41:04,320
Enough champagne...

2811
01:41:04,320 --> 01:41:05,800
To fill the Nile.

2812
01:41:14,540 --> 01:41:15,300
Alright.

2813
01:41:16,060 --> 01:41:16,840
Oh man.

2814
01:41:17,520 --> 01:41:17,980
Sorry.

2815
01:41:18,200 --> 01:41:19,280
I had to...

2816
01:41:19,280 --> 01:41:19,700
I'm sorry.

2817
01:41:20,100 --> 01:41:21,680
She's dead already.

2818
01:41:22,980 --> 01:41:25,200
It's unironically a good film.

2819
01:41:25,700 --> 01:41:25,900
Damn.

2820
01:41:26,380 --> 01:41:34,380
I feel like if they casted any other actress other than Gal Gadot, it might have been an even better film.

2821
01:41:34,380 --> 01:41:35,540
I mean...

2822
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:39,640
Bro...

2823
01:41:39,640 --> 01:41:40,600
I feel like...

2824
01:41:40,600 --> 01:41:41,360
Look, I don't...

2825
01:41:41,360 --> 01:41:43,300
I'm not a very good voice actor.

2826
01:41:44,040 --> 01:41:46,160
When it comes to like...

2827
01:41:46,160 --> 01:41:46,720
Um...

2828
01:41:46,720 --> 01:41:47,460
When it came...

2829
01:41:47,460 --> 01:41:49,700
Comes to like actually voice acting something.

2830
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:51,140
But I feel like...

2831
01:41:51,140 --> 01:41:53,480
At least I'm not at that level.

2832
01:41:53,800 --> 01:41:54,220
You know?

2833
01:41:56,380 --> 01:41:57,520
At least...

2834
01:41:57,520 --> 01:41:58,500
At least...

2835
01:41:58,500 --> 01:41:59,820
At least like...

2836
01:41:59,820 --> 01:42:03,460
I have a little bit more emotion than that.

2837
01:42:07,680 --> 01:42:08,080
Okay.

2838
01:42:08,320 --> 01:42:08,560
Sorry.

2839
01:42:08,760 --> 01:42:11,240
I got like a little sidetracked on my...

2840
01:42:12,080 --> 01:42:12,480
Um...

2841
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:13,100
Gal Gadot.

2842
01:42:13,280 --> 01:42:14,500
I don't even know how we got together.

2843
01:42:14,880 --> 01:42:17,400
I don't even know how we even got to...

2844
01:42:17,400 --> 01:42:18,780
How we even got there.

2845
01:42:19,300 --> 01:42:19,620
Um...

2846
01:42:19,620 --> 01:42:19,800
Oh yeah.

2847
01:42:19,860 --> 01:42:20,900
I was talking about movies.

2848
01:42:21,100 --> 01:42:22,140
I was talking about movies.

2849
01:42:24,040 --> 01:42:24,440
Um...

2850
01:42:24,860 --> 01:42:25,260
Uh...

2851
01:42:25,260 --> 01:42:26,160
But yeah.

2852
01:42:27,600 --> 01:42:28,000
Um...

2853
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:28,660
Everyone...

2854
01:42:28,660 --> 01:42:29,240
I don't watch movies.

2855
01:42:29,320 --> 01:42:29,540
Oh yeah.

2856
01:42:29,640 --> 01:42:30,260
I watched...

2857
01:42:30,260 --> 01:42:30,860
What is it?

2858
01:42:30,920 --> 01:42:31,780
There's a new season.

2859
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:33,360
Um...

2860
01:42:33,360 --> 01:42:33,820
What is it?

2861
01:42:34,720 --> 01:42:36,060
Sex, love, robots?

2862
01:42:36,340 --> 01:42:36,840
Was that it?

2863
01:42:36,920 --> 01:42:37,080
No.

2864
01:42:37,900 --> 01:42:38,920
What was the full...

2865
01:42:38,920 --> 01:42:40,520
It's not sex, love, robots.

2866
01:42:40,700 --> 01:42:41,000
It's...

2867
01:42:43,820 --> 01:42:44,540
It's not...

2868
01:42:44,540 --> 01:42:45,100
Love...

2869
01:42:45,100 --> 01:42:45,400
Oh no.

2870
01:42:45,480 --> 01:42:46,340
It's love, sex, and robots.

2871
01:42:46,460 --> 01:42:46,600
Wait.

2872
01:42:46,660 --> 01:42:47,080
Is it that?

2873
01:42:47,180 --> 01:42:47,560
No way.

2874
01:42:47,800 --> 01:42:48,040
Sorry.

2875
01:42:48,160 --> 01:42:49,700
Love, death, and robots.

2876
01:42:50,020 --> 01:42:50,380
Sorry.

2877
01:42:50,380 --> 01:42:55,200
I don't know why I keep thinking it's sex, love, and robots.

2878
01:42:55,260 --> 01:42:56,400
It's not the first time.

2879
01:42:56,900 --> 01:42:58,400
It's love, death, and robots.

2880
01:42:58,740 --> 01:43:01,820
I watched the new season of love, death, and robots.

2881
01:43:01,900 --> 01:43:05,300
And I will tell you, it's the black mirror effect.

2882
01:43:05,880 --> 01:43:07,800
Where, um...

2883
01:43:07,800 --> 01:43:08,800
Where...

2884
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:10,000
It's really bad.

2885
01:43:10,260 --> 01:43:11,160
It's not...

2886
01:43:11,160 --> 01:43:14,000
The new season sucks a lot.

2887
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,480
Because, like, um...

2888
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:17,840
It's just more...

2889
01:43:17,840 --> 01:43:20,240
The new season is more like...

2890
01:43:20,240 --> 01:43:22,460
It's more like...

2891
01:43:22,460 --> 01:43:24,580
Animation showcase...

2892
01:43:24,580 --> 01:43:26,240
Than, um...

2893
01:43:26,240 --> 01:43:28,260
It's an animation showcase...

2894
01:43:28,260 --> 01:43:30,640
Rather than an actual, like...

2895
01:43:30,640 --> 01:43:31,280
You know...

2896
01:43:31,280 --> 01:43:33,140
Actual, like, storyline for it.

2897
01:43:33,180 --> 01:43:34,760
I know, like, in the first...

2898
01:43:34,760 --> 01:43:35,640
Two seasons.

2899
01:43:35,820 --> 01:43:37,120
The first two seasons were really good.

2900
01:43:37,380 --> 01:43:38,660
Where they showed...

2901
01:43:38,660 --> 01:43:39,740
They mixed between the two.

2902
01:43:40,100 --> 01:43:41,020
So there's no...

2903
01:43:41,020 --> 01:43:42,540
There's barely any, like...

2904
01:43:42,540 --> 01:43:44,500
Story focused, um...

2905
01:43:45,740 --> 01:43:47,680
Story focused, like...

2906
01:43:47,680 --> 01:43:48,760
Episodes in there.

2907
01:43:48,980 --> 01:43:50,540
I'm only halfway through, though.

2908
01:43:50,920 --> 01:43:51,340
I'm...

2909
01:43:51,340 --> 01:43:53,600
I'm halfway through love, death, robots.

2910
01:43:53,940 --> 01:43:54,720
But, like...

2911
01:43:54,720 --> 01:43:57,200
The first episode, I was so confused.

2912
01:43:57,580 --> 01:43:59,420
Because I was like, where's the love?

2913
01:43:59,600 --> 01:44:00,500
Where's the death?

2914
01:44:00,640 --> 01:44:02,300
And where are the robots?

2915
01:44:02,600 --> 01:44:04,340
Because love, death, robots is like...

2916
01:44:04,340 --> 01:44:06,880
Each episode had at least one thing.

2917
01:44:07,180 --> 01:44:09,620
About love, death, or robots.

2918
01:44:09,620 --> 01:44:12,760
And the first episode is literally, like...

2919
01:44:12,760 --> 01:44:14,920
An animation showcase...

2920
01:44:14,920 --> 01:44:15,480
Of...

2921
01:44:15,480 --> 01:44:16,580
Red Hot Chili Peppers.

2922
01:44:16,740 --> 01:44:17,340
Like...

2923
01:44:17,340 --> 01:44:18,920
That's really it!

2924
01:44:19,120 --> 01:44:20,260
It was just...

2925
01:44:20,260 --> 01:44:22,640
It was just a music video...

2926
01:44:22,640 --> 01:44:24,620
For Red Hot Chili Peppers.

2927
01:44:24,880 --> 01:44:26,180
I was like, wait...

2928
01:44:26,180 --> 01:44:26,700
That's it?

2929
01:44:26,860 --> 01:44:27,420
That's where...

2930
01:44:27,420 --> 01:44:27,820
There's...

2931
01:44:27,820 --> 01:44:28,860
It was just a concert.

2932
01:44:32,100 --> 01:44:34,620
I was so confused.

2933
01:44:35,060 --> 01:44:38,100
It was literally a music video for...

2934
01:44:38,100 --> 01:44:38,620
For them.

2935
01:44:39,720 --> 01:44:40,400
For...

2936
01:44:40,400 --> 01:44:40,820
Um...

2937
01:44:40,820 --> 01:44:41,940
For one of their songs.

2938
01:44:43,240 --> 01:44:43,920
Um...

2939
01:44:43,920 --> 01:44:44,200
Um...

2940
01:44:44,200 --> 01:44:44,540
Oh yeah!

2941
01:44:44,720 --> 01:44:44,880
No!

2942
01:44:45,020 --> 01:44:48,060
There was one guy that dies in the audience!

2943
01:44:48,500 --> 01:44:49,080
I guess...

2944
01:44:49,080 --> 01:44:49,800
Wait, you're right!

2945
01:44:50,960 --> 01:44:52,260
It was like...

2946
01:44:52,880 --> 01:44:55,900
One guy that dies in the audience!

2947
01:44:56,340 --> 01:44:58,140
Because people were like...

2948
01:44:58,140 --> 01:44:59,120
So excited!

2949
01:44:59,620 --> 01:45:00,020
But...

2950
01:45:00,020 --> 01:45:00,940
And that's the death!

2951
01:45:01,120 --> 01:45:02,700
The one death that counted!

2952
01:45:03,220 --> 01:45:03,700
Uh...

2953
01:45:03,700 --> 01:45:04,420
Yeah!

2954
01:45:04,540 --> 01:45:05,700
I forgot about it!

2955
01:45:05,700 --> 01:45:07,020
I was so fucking...

2956
01:45:07,440 --> 01:45:09,240
I was so fucking confused!

2957
01:45:09,580 --> 01:45:10,700
I was like...

2958
01:45:10,700 --> 01:45:11,520
What the fuck?

2959
01:45:11,660 --> 01:45:11,940
Where...

2960
01:45:11,940 --> 01:45:13,000
Where is...

2961
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:13,540
Oh...

2962
01:45:13,540 --> 01:45:13,900
What?

2963
01:45:14,040 --> 01:45:14,680
That's it?

2964
01:45:14,780 --> 01:45:15,580
That's the story?

2965
01:45:16,420 --> 01:45:16,980
Um...

2966
01:45:16,980 --> 01:45:18,420
No, I watched Secret Level.

2967
01:45:18,580 --> 01:45:18,960
It sucked.

2968
01:45:19,120 --> 01:45:20,760
I think Secret Level was not great.

2969
01:45:20,900 --> 01:45:22,480
It was incredibly hit or miss.

2970
01:45:22,640 --> 01:45:24,900
The episodes are either incredibly short.

2971
01:45:24,960 --> 01:45:26,060
Or like...

2972
01:45:26,060 --> 01:45:27,080
It was just...

2973
01:45:27,080 --> 01:45:27,580
Like...

2974
01:45:27,580 --> 01:45:28,760
It was just not good.

2975
01:45:29,020 --> 01:45:29,380
I was...

2976
01:45:29,380 --> 01:45:31,180
I honestly just did not...

2977
01:45:31,180 --> 01:45:32,640
I did not enjoy Secret Level.

2978
01:45:32,640 --> 01:45:33,440
The...

2979
01:45:33,440 --> 01:45:34,300
I didn't think...

2980
01:45:34,300 --> 01:45:34,720
Um...

2981
01:45:35,580 --> 01:45:38,360
I felt like a lot of the episodes were like...

2982
01:45:38,360 --> 01:45:39,420
Incredibly short.

2983
01:45:39,760 --> 01:45:41,020
And then like...

2984
01:45:41,020 --> 01:45:41,700
Uh...

2985
01:45:42,260 --> 01:45:44,620
The Mega Man was so fucking short.

2986
01:45:44,820 --> 01:45:45,720
I was not...

2987
01:45:45,720 --> 01:45:48,120
I was not expecting...

2988
01:45:48,120 --> 01:45:48,980
Um...

2989
01:45:48,980 --> 01:45:51,340
The Mega Man one to be so short.

2990
01:45:51,620 --> 01:45:52,600
Because I felt like...

2991
01:45:52,600 --> 01:45:53,120
I...

2992
01:45:53,120 --> 01:45:53,560
It was...

2993
01:45:53,560 --> 01:45:53,960
I was like...

2994
01:45:53,960 --> 01:45:54,660
Wait, that's it?

2995
01:45:55,060 --> 01:45:55,580
Um...

2996
01:45:56,120 --> 01:45:57,760
I feel like there was only like...

2997
01:45:57,760 --> 01:45:59,320
Two episodes that were good.

2998
01:45:59,540 --> 01:46:00,600
I heard the Warhammer...

2999
01:46:00,600 --> 01:46:02,200
I don't think I got to the Warhammer one.

3000
01:46:02,200 --> 01:46:02,920
Um...

3001
01:46:02,920 --> 01:46:04,340
But I heard the Warhammer one was...

3002
01:46:04,340 --> 01:46:05,020
Oh wait, no, I did.

3003
01:46:05,180 --> 01:46:06,320
I got to the Warhammer one.

3004
01:46:06,520 --> 01:46:07,860
I also like...

3005
01:46:07,860 --> 01:46:08,580
Didn't...

3006
01:46:09,480 --> 01:46:10,580
Didn't really watch.

3007
01:46:10,980 --> 01:46:11,420
Um...

3008
01:46:11,420 --> 01:46:12,920
I don't remember much of it.

3009
01:46:12,980 --> 01:46:14,020
It was just like...

3010
01:46:14,020 --> 01:46:15,240
It was so...

3011
01:46:15,240 --> 01:46:16,140
It was so weird.

3012
01:46:16,280 --> 01:46:16,960
I think like...

3013
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:18,960
I just didn't think they did it really well.

3014
01:46:19,100 --> 01:46:19,520
In general.

3015
01:46:20,880 --> 01:46:21,320
Um...

3016
01:46:21,320 --> 01:46:23,920
The Pac-Man one was based off of their new game.

3017
01:46:24,200 --> 01:46:25,000
The new...

3018
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:25,700
Um...

3019
01:46:25,700 --> 01:46:27,740
I just didn't remember it very well.

3020
01:46:28,400 --> 01:46:29,580
Warhammer Secret Level.

3021
01:46:29,680 --> 01:46:30,500
I just knew like...

3022
01:46:30,500 --> 01:46:34,700
It was just not... the secret level was just not as good as I expected.

3023
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:35,620
Oh wait!

3024
01:46:35,820 --> 01:46:36,300
No, I remember.

3025
01:46:36,460 --> 01:46:36,820
I remember.

3026
01:46:36,980 --> 01:46:37,400
I remember.

3027
01:46:37,520 --> 01:46:38,860
The animation was really good for this one.

3028
01:46:38,960 --> 01:46:39,820
No, I remember now.

3029
01:46:40,280 --> 01:46:41,860
I remember the Warhammer one.

3030
01:46:45,620 --> 01:46:50,780
But I didn't enjoy secret level that much just because a lot of the episodes were big misses.

3031
01:46:51,560 --> 01:46:56,240
There was only like one or two that was good, but you have to like dig through the trenches to find a good one.

3032
01:46:56,240 --> 01:47:00,500
Um, but like, yeah, I don't know.

3033
01:47:01,120 --> 01:47:05,060
Like, I feel like people... the anthology series for it, I like...

3034
01:47:05,060 --> 01:47:14,920
Like, you know how I feel like Love, Death, and Robots did the whole like hiring animators to make like their unique story for each one.

3035
01:47:14,920 --> 01:47:17,520
And then other places started copying them.

3036
01:47:17,660 --> 01:47:21,720
But like, oh my god, the longer they do it, the worse it gets.

3037
01:47:21,800 --> 01:47:24,880
It's just, I feel like there's no quality control anymore to it.

3038
01:47:24,880 --> 01:47:29,340
But, oh yeah, speaking of Netflix, Sesame Street is now coming to Netflix.

3039
01:47:29,640 --> 01:47:30,080
Wow!

3040
01:47:30,920 --> 01:47:32,500
That was, I thought that was really cool.

3041
01:47:32,600 --> 01:47:34,880
Because they don't, they didn't cancel Sesame Street.

3042
01:47:35,160 --> 01:47:39,420
But they're also, people were really worried because they're like, oh...

3043
01:47:40,320 --> 01:47:44,980
Oh no, they're gonna, like, kids have to pay Netflix now to watch Sesame Street.

3044
01:47:45,140 --> 01:47:46,620
But it's still gonna be on the PBS.

3045
01:47:46,780 --> 01:47:48,140
It's still gonna be on PBS.

3046
01:47:48,140 --> 01:47:51,120
It's just that, um...

3047
01:47:51,120 --> 01:47:55,980
Um, it's just that Netflix is helping fund, helping with funding the shows now.

3048
01:47:56,200 --> 01:47:58,380
Which will be like, I think that's okay.

3049
01:47:58,380 --> 01:48:01,060
Just because of the fact that it's either that or get canceled.

3050
01:48:01,440 --> 01:48:03,060
So, um...

3051
01:48:03,060 --> 01:48:06,460
So, like, I'm glad that Sesame Street is...

3052
01:48:06,460 --> 01:48:09,100
Like, I'm glad that Elmo's not homeless, you know?

3053
01:48:09,100 --> 01:48:09,680
I'm...

3054
01:48:12,380 --> 01:48:13,020
I'm...

3055
01:48:13,020 --> 01:48:16,800
I'm glad, I'm glad Elmo is not homeless.

3056
01:48:17,300 --> 01:48:17,620
Yay!

3057
01:48:19,860 --> 01:48:21,500
Um, what happened to PBS?

3058
01:48:22,160 --> 01:48:23,160
Um, funding.

3059
01:48:23,460 --> 01:48:24,920
They don't have enough funding right now.

3060
01:48:25,140 --> 01:48:27,560
So, that's why they were shopping the shows around.

3061
01:48:27,780 --> 01:48:29,580
And Netflix decided to pick it up.

3062
01:48:29,740 --> 01:48:34,780
Speaking of shopping shows around, Gumball is getting a reboot on Disney slash Hulu.

3063
01:48:35,480 --> 01:48:37,040
Which was crazy to think about.

3064
01:48:37,040 --> 01:48:38,760
But to be fair, um...

3065
01:48:38,760 --> 01:48:41,140
Warner Brothers is not doing very well right now.

3066
01:48:43,920 --> 01:48:45,640
So, I'm not surprised.

3067
01:48:46,320 --> 01:48:46,780
I...

3068
01:48:48,860 --> 01:48:49,720
Anyway, guys.

3069
01:48:50,160 --> 01:48:51,480
I'm gonna call it here.

3070
01:48:52,140 --> 01:48:52,660
Um...

3071
01:48:52,660 --> 01:48:56,560
I have a long, long, long week ahead of me.

3072
01:48:56,760 --> 01:48:57,960
So, um...

3073
01:48:57,960 --> 01:48:59,160
So, I'm gonna call it here.

3074
01:48:59,240 --> 01:49:01,660
It's really great to talk with my Dragoons again.

3075
01:49:01,920 --> 01:49:04,420
I had a great time hanging out with everybody.

3076
01:49:04,720 --> 01:49:06,140
Talking again with you guys.

3077
01:49:06,140 --> 01:49:07,600
Giving you guys a live update.

3078
01:49:08,080 --> 01:49:09,520
And just hanging out with all of you guys.

3079
01:49:09,600 --> 01:49:11,900
You guys always make it so fun.

3080
01:49:12,060 --> 01:49:14,380
And I love just talking with my Dragoons.

3081
01:49:14,400 --> 01:49:15,280
I miss you guys!

3082
01:49:15,440 --> 01:49:16,060
You know I do.

3083
01:49:16,340 --> 01:49:17,680
You know I miss hanging out with you guys.

3084
01:49:17,780 --> 01:49:19,120
And I hope you guys miss hanging out with me.

3085
01:49:19,620 --> 01:49:19,980
Um...

3086
01:49:19,980 --> 01:49:20,280
But yeah!

3087
01:49:20,480 --> 01:49:22,620
Thank you everybody for coming to the stream!

3088
01:49:22,900 --> 01:49:23,280
Hi guys!

3089
01:49:23,320 --> 01:49:24,540
Welcome to the Tomato Farm!

3090
01:49:24,580 --> 01:49:25,140
Welcome, welcome!

3091
01:49:25,140 --> 01:49:27,380
We're gonna be back to a regular scheduled week.

3092
01:49:28,560 --> 01:49:28,960
Um...

3093
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:29,980
My schedule's already out.

3094
01:49:30,160 --> 01:49:32,000
So you know like tomorrow is Super Mario Mon.

3095
01:49:32,280 --> 01:49:33,480
So we're gonna go into that.

3096
01:49:34,040 --> 01:49:34,280
Um...

3097
01:49:34,280 --> 01:49:36,520
As always everybody, stay hydrated.

3098
01:49:36,720 --> 01:49:37,120
Posture check.

3099
01:49:37,300 --> 01:49:39,020
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

3100
01:49:39,160 --> 01:49:40,860
And if you step for me, head to bed!

3101
01:49:40,980 --> 01:49:41,360
Cause...

3102
01:49:41,360 --> 01:49:42,120
You deserve it!

3103
01:49:42,140 --> 01:49:43,480
I have to walk Dad now.

3104
01:49:43,740 --> 01:49:44,140
Um...

3105
01:49:44,140 --> 01:49:45,960
Because I'm a little late for his little walkies.

3106
01:49:46,040 --> 01:49:46,680
Just a little late!

3107
01:49:47,080 --> 01:49:47,440
Um...

3108
01:49:47,440 --> 01:49:48,720
So I'm gonna go walk Dad now.

3109
01:49:48,940 --> 01:49:49,240
But...

3110
01:49:49,240 --> 01:49:50,440

3120
01:50:00,300 --> 01:50:00,660
Bye!

3121
01:50:38,110 --> 01:50:38,470
Oh!

3122
01:50:38,470 --> 01:50:39,230
Secret ending!

3123
01:50:39,370 --> 01:50:39,930
Secret ending!

3124
01:50:40,090 --> 01:50:40,930
I forgot to say!

3125
01:50:41,230 --> 01:50:42,390
And I said it on Twitter!

3126
01:50:42,670 --> 01:50:44,270
But I wanna say thank you again for all the support!

3127
01:50:44,710 --> 01:50:46,810
Especially when I took that week break off!

3128
01:50:46,810 --> 01:50:48,170
And all the vouchers and everything!

3129
01:50:48,570 --> 01:50:50,390
And all the outpouring love and support!

3130
01:50:50,810 --> 01:50:51,170
Um...

3131
01:50:51,170 --> 01:50:52,310
When I had to take that break!

3132
01:50:52,310 --> 01:50:53,790
It really does mean a lot!

3133
01:50:53,930 --> 01:50:56,330
I was really scared and nervous during that!

3134
01:50:56,550 --> 01:50:56,750
And so...

3135
01:50:56,750 --> 01:50:57,510
Thank you guys!

3136
01:50:57,850 --> 01:50:58,210
Thank you!

3137
01:50:58,350 --> 01:50:59,850
I really appreciate it everybody!

3138
01:51:00,490 --> 01:51:01,250
Bye bye everyone!

3139
01:51:01,610 --> 01:51:01,990

3140
