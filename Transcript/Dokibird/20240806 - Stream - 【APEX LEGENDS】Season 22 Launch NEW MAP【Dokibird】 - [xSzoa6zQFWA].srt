00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:45,770
Hello everybody!

2
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:52,930
Alright, I'm gonna need you guys help for this because I realized...

3
00:01:52,930 --> 00:02:00,830
While I was like... by the way I'm still at my old place right now because I haven't moved my PC setup yet.

4
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:05,130
So like... I basically have to commute back and forth.

5
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:12,650
I have to take public transport and commute back and forth to stream right now.

6
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:17,610
Alright, by the way I need your help guys because like...

7
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:23,190
I bought a new mic cable because I realized I've been...

8
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:25,970
Yes guys, I had to take public transport.

9
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:32,870
I was so confused because like... I haven't taken public transport in a very long time.

10
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:36,670
Because like... you know, since like university wise.

11
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:38,930
And then like... I had to google.

12
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:39,730
I was like...

13
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:41,510
How to pay for bus.

14
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:47,770
Because I was like... I cannot keep Ubering.

15
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:51,290
I cannot... I cannot keep Ubering.

16
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:52,590
I don't know!

17
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:53,710
I was like...

18
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:57,390
What do they need to pay for bus?

19
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:06,450
I don't know.

20
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:08,030
I was worried rules changed.

21
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:11,910
I was worried the rules have changed.

22
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:15,590
And I wanted to be sure because I was like...

23
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:17,790
Oh my god, I don't have... who carries cash?

24
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:19,310
I was like... who carries cash?

25
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:20,090
I don't have to pay for bus anymore.

26
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:22,530
How do I pay for bus?

27
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:24,510
Because in the university...

28
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:27,630
They give you like bus passes in university.

29
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:30,650
So I never had to like... figure out how to pay bus.

30
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:36,150
I was like... how do people outside of university pay for bus?

31
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:42,290
Like... I don't carry cash anymore.

32
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:45,570
I don't carry... I do carry like a little bit of cash.

33
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:46,810
Just for like emergencies.

34
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:48,090
Because like... you know...

35
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:49,510
What if like card readers...

36
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:52,490
What if like... Y2K happened...

37
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:54,870
But like... it was too... like you know...

38
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:55,810
It was just delayed.

39
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:05,070
What if Y2K meant 2024 during August or some shit.

40
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:11,130
And then... I was just like...

41
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:14,330
I was like... oh yeah... I should carry a little bit of cash.

42
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:17,070
So... so I... I have...

43
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:17,550
But they're like...

44
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,290
They're like $50 bills.

45
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:21,090
They're like $50 to

46
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:25,850
the bus driver.

47
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:27,750
Like... I mean, they deserve more.

48
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:28,990
But like... I'm not...

49
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:30,650
I'm not the one gonna give them.

50
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,010
I agree that they deserve more... more.

51
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:34,590
But I'm not gonna give fucking $50.

52
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:39,490
Why 50?

53
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:40,630
I don't know.

54
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:42,090
Because I don't wanna carry change.

55
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:43,370
That's why.

56
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:46,550
Why carry 5, $10 bills...

57
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:49,070
When I can carry one $50 bill.

58
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:51,810
Oh, I know I have several $50 bills in there.

59
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:52,250
Like...

60
00:04:55,730 --> 00:05:00,630
So Sound Guy, you know, let me know if I'm like snapping or crackling because I did buy...

61
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:08,430
I bought a new like microphone cable and I like rearrange the cables for a little bit.

62
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:11,150
Like I know it's like why do you have to rearrange your cables?

63
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:17,150
Because like you're going to move anyway, like you're going to move this setup anyway.

64
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:21,230
Well, well, I have to be here for like a week.

65
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:21,650
Okay.

66
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:30,270
Until this... until like... I'm not going to like suddenly a bit echoey.

67
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,490
Yeah, there's like nothing here anymore.

68
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,830
There's nothing here to sound for me.

69
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:43,570
My room is literally... is literally like the PC setup right now.

70
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:45,350
Like everything's almost gone.

71
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:50,230
It's literally just the PC here.

72
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:57,590
So there's... there's almost no furniture anymore or like, you know, my...

73
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:01,790
like my dokimers like acting as like Sound Guard and everything.

74
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:05,630
So I mean there's still stuff here.

75
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:07,370
There's actually still stuff here.

76
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:11,950
It's just like not as much as it used to be because like I said like...

77
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:17,010
Like I said, I moved around.

78
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:19,170
A lot of like I already moved.

79
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:21,070
I'd have like 20% left.

80
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:26,350
I've 20% left in the... in my... my room alone.

81
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:27,190
So...

82
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:33,250
So that's why it is a little bit echoey right now.

83
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:35,610
It's just a little... I'm sorry.

84
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:36,690
I don't know what to do.

85
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:40,610
I'm not going to put stuff... you're going to have to deal with that for... for a week.

86
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:46,010
Okay guys, you're going to have to deal with the... look it's... I'm a... it's been a... I'm a mess.

87
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:46,390
Okay.

88
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:46,750
I'm a...

89
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:51,050
I literally googled how... how to pay for bus.

90
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:51,870
Guys.

91
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:52,690
I...

92
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:56,570
Guys, please.

93
00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:02,190
I'm getting further... the longer I stream the less relatable I'm being guys.

94
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:08,690
Oh my God.

95
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:12,450
Oh, yeah, by the way, I want to talk about this real quick.

96
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:14,170
Like this has nothing to do with Apex.

97
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:17,050
I just want to talk about it because like I thought...

98
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:19,970
I just want to talk about it because like I thought it was really funny and the Olympia...

99
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:19,990
the...

100
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:20,250
the...

101
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:21,270
was it the IOC?

102
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:29,470
That's the International Olympic Committee is trying to like hide it and has been filing takedowns of it like everywhere.

103
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:35,930
But do you guys see that part of that guy who failed the the high jump because his dick was too big?

104
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:37,090
Did you guys see that?

105
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:46,710
And then the funniest shit is that they did the... what was it?

106
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:47,670
The Streisand effect?

107
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:55,410
The Olympics did the Streisand effect on it and tried to file takedowns everywhere of the video.

108
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:59,970
So like people are like, I'm like, why would you do that?

109
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:03,350
Not everybody is going to post it everywhere now.

110
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:17,390
Yeah, the I... the Olympics has been like... yeah, the Olympics has been fucking DMCAing every tweet and video of that guy.

111
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:25,950
So like, like it's like those those like high jump thing where like you need a stick to get over like the pole.

112
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:30,250
I want to talk about it because I DMCA this Olympics.

113
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:44,710
I want to talk about it because like if the Olympics actually DMCA or takedown this stream, that's a story I can tell and like that's just going to make me like more relevant because...

114
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:47,950
But if they don't then I spread...

115
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:52,930
I'm going to spread the news so that it'll still so people will know they can't censor this.

116
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:54,470
This is important news.

117
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:56,110
Okay, they try to censor it.

118
00:08:56,150 --> 00:09:00,590
So I'm trying to make sure everybody knows.

119
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:09,150
But yeah, yeah, it's actually crazy.

120
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:17,410
It's like one of those like the jump thing where like the pole, the pole, like, you know, we have to jump over like this like, what's it called?

121
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:27,470
Like the the the fuck is that called the little pole thing, you know, like use a pole to jump over a separate pole and then like he almost got over it.

122
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:27,990
The pole bot.

123
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:29,450
Yeah, he almost got over it.

124
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:35,710
But then like his peepee was just too big and it like touched it and then he fell.

125
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:42,690
I thought it was like the fucking funniest shit ever because people were like damn man.

126
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:47,150
You can't you can't be thinking those thoughts and then others were like bro.

127
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:48,510
He was.

128
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:55,000
I was like what the fuck?

129
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,780
That's crazy.

130
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:00,140
Holy shit.

131
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,640
That's actually crazy.

132
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:05,540
I was like, oh my God.

133
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:15,200
And then the IOC started filing takedowns and DMCA's and I was like, oh my God.

134
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,780
Now everybody will know about this man.

135
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:18,860
I was like, oh my God.

136
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:38,640
I don't know if I could find it's so funny, but I don't know if there's like if there's like videos of it still existing because they actually even need a pole.

137
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:44,500
The thing is I don't know if like oh there it is.

138
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:47,700
This this is I thought this over here.

139
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:48,980
Here you go guys.

140
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,760
It existed.

141
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,540
I found it guys.

142
00:10:54,960 --> 00:11:08,860
This is the news that also the other guy that fucking failed the pole vault very sadly the one that like he tried to jump on it and then and then he didn't even like get on top of the pole.

143
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,640
Like it was so sad.

144
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,260
This is so sad.

145
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:13,860
I tweeted.

146
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:15,520
I posted a link in chat.

147
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,680
I want to thank you.

148
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:23,260
You don't keep most popular man in the Olympic Village.

149
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:34,700
It's because of massive dog.

150
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:42,460
Hey, thank you.

151
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:42,920
This is Richard.

152
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,340
Thank you.

153
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:43,740
Thank you.

154
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:44,780
Big peepee problems.

155
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:45,760
Couldn't be.

156
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,780
He.

157
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:47,020
He.

158
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:51,960
I think you're the super chat.

159
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:52,380
Thank you.

160
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,320
Thank you to be fair.

161
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,160
They should have took this peepee better.

162
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,360
What if it was already?

163
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:11,600
You know, it's like the first thing you would and you know, that was your Olympic athlete and you know, this is an issue.

164
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:17,220
I feel like this is already as best as they could do.

165
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,460
Like the comments.

166
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,920
This is unfortunate or is it?

167
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,740
Oh my God.

168
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,180
Oh, it's it's so.

169
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,120
Oh my God.

170
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,940
I just want to know like casting wise like how?

171
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,560
How did you get?

172
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,260
What?

173
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:47,620
The thing?

174
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,320
Okay.

175
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:55,580
There's the other one to the pole fall goes hard guys is actually funny.

176
00:12:56,140 --> 00:13:05,560
The the pole actually goes so hard because this is this is the other one that that happened.

177
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:11,340
This was before this was before but I was just like, oh my God, it's so sad.

178
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,200
It's just like, oh no.

179
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:17,240
Oh, you're so sad when I saw that.

180
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:27,280
Because that's before and then like and then and then the other one happened and it was like, oh no, you couldn't get over.

181
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,220
I was like, I don't think that's supposed to happen.

182
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,360
You're supposed to go over.

183
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,340
Oh my God.

184
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:40,660
Oh my God.

185
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:47,080
Yeah, that was like, that was so sad when I saw that the pulse.

186
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,360
I like the comments though.

187
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:54,460
They finally I like how someone was like they finally allowed the average guy to compete at the only thing.

188
00:13:56,380 --> 00:14:11,640
That's like literally I found out about the other dude because I was looking at the Twitter replies and everyone and then they're like, oh, hey, that's nearly as funny as the other dude knocking the bar off with his boner and I saw that I was like, what?

189
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,500
And then I saw that video.

190
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,160
Oh, oh, oh,

191
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:25,120
anyway, that's my daily Olympic update for you guys that all right.

192
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:32,220
Anyway, let's talk about apex versus the guy tells you not to worry about no.

193
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:43,380
But yes, I let me know if I start crackling again and then if it's okay, okay, then that means I fixed the problem.

194
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,600
Uh, uh, don't worry.

195
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,800
I give you guys the Olympic news that matters.

196
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:59,280
Uh, also, you guys, you guys remember my talk about listen the river and they decide to fucking swim in the river.

197
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:02,700
Apparently, some of the athletes contracted E.

198
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:06,280
Coli after swimming in the sand.

199
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:10,540
I told you I told you this.

200
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,760
You can say you fixed it.

201
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:17,720
You fix the River, You can never fix 2,000 years of shit!

202
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:19,880
Yeah!

203
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:25,120
Like some athletes contracted E.coli.

204
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:30,760
I was like, oh my god, you see videos of them throwing up after swimming there.

205
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,440
Oh my god.

206
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,800
Yeah, who would have thought?

207
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,240
I fucking called it.

208
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,020
I called it!

209
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:40,200
I was like, I would never swim in that river.

210
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:45,520
I don't care how like they spent like a billion dollars cleaning up the shit in the river.

211
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:53,000
Like cleaning up like everything there, but like I was like no matter what also like the people protesting and stuff.

212
00:15:53,380 --> 00:16:01,160
Like I don't care I'm not...

213
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:06,820
Like you can tell me you spent a billion dollars trying to clean up, clean it up.

214
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,920
But like alright, it's still this river.

215
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,880
There's no fixing that river.

216
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:12,680
There's no...

217
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:17,020
There's no fixing that river.

218
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,560
That river ain't good anymore.

219
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,720
Yeah, they've spent like a billion dollars.

220
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:40,720
That's why people were... I mean to be fair for every Olympic, for every country that hosts the Olympics, there will always be somebody... there will always be a group of people complaining because they spend... a lot of countries tend to go into debt after.

221
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:45,080
Same with like the World Cup for soccer slash football.

222
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:54,220
That's why people complain a lot for those who are not fans of those particular sports because they spent billions of dollars making like stuff for it.

223
00:16:54,360 --> 00:17:01,940
And then yeah, and then like some countries actually go into debt after after like whatever fucking sport happens.

224
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,640
So there's always protests about it.

225
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,660
And I don't... someone said, it's not true, but like I don't know.

226
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,820
I bet like there's a lot of people in Paris.

227
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:20,720
Because like people were like we should protest by shitting in the river during the events.

228
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:25,000
And I'm like there's someone... I remember like someone in my chat was like that's not true.

229
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,880
It was just like they were just... it was just propaganda.

230
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,280
I was like there's a lot of people in Paris.

231
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:31,720
It only takes one crazy person to shit in the river.

232
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:32,420
Like...

233
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,900
That's all... that's all I'm saying.

234
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:39,820
Like it only takes one person to be...

235
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:39,940
Like it only takes one person to be...

236
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,580
I don't care if you drink it.

237
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:46,300
It's just people are just saying it.

238
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:55,080
Yeah, so that's that's my daily Olympic news.

239
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,720
It's a big river.

240
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,920
And the river got one guide.

241
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:06,920
Alright.

242
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:12,360
To be fair, I bet you a lot of animals are doing... I mean when you're flying, the birds are flying.

243
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,620
And then the birds flying.

244
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:15,700
And like...

245
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,160
And like...

246
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,920
I'm pretty sure there is bird poop in that river, too.

247
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,160
That's why like...

248
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,660
Honestly, all rivers are dangerous.

249
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,040
Alright, one last Olympic update.

250
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,000
I just find it...

251
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,420
Like a lot of people are talking about like, the sharpshooters.

252
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:35,700
But there's like so many funny shit happening outside of that.

253
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:42,340
Because there was one guy, the canoe rower, I don't know if you guys saw it, But there was like one guy, the canoe rower.

254
00:18:42,360 --> 00:19:05,420
I was like, I don't think you should flex that.

255
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,540
He was like, finally!

256
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:13,260
I have a medal that represents my rank!

257
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:16,840
And like, his rank was bronze in League of Legends.

258
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,440
And I was like, bro, that's not a flex vest!

259
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:24,740
Not a win flex bro.

260
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:25,800
Yes.

261
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,920
Oh my god.

262
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:35,280
I like how somebody was like, no it was gold.

263
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:40,100
Bro, it's still not a flex vest!

264
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:43,640
It doesn't matter, bronze, silver or gold.

265
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,180
It's not very high elo.

266
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,460
Oh my god.

267
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,960
Yeah, I just thought it was really funny.

268
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,340
I'm not so funny.

269
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,820
Oh my god.

270
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,120
And it had to be League of All Games.

271
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,120
Why would you do that?

272
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:04,920
Why would you play League of Legends?

273
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,280
Right after the Olympics.

274
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:08,840
I don't know.

275
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:11,420
I would say Overwatch is torture.

276
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:15,960
But I feel like League in itself is one of the circles of hell.

277
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,740
Like, right after the Olympics, he went straight to League.

278
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,580
League player, I touched grass.

279
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:29,060
I was just like, oh my god.

280
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,780
That's absolutely crazy.

281
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:34,420
I don't know how he has the fucking...

282
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:38,420
Like, mental for League right after.

283
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:41,920
Alright, anyway.

284
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:42,900
Apex!

285
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,180
Apex updates.

286
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:47,240
So, I know I should have been...

287
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,840
This is like daily updates.

288
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,360
Daily Olympic updates.

289
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,200
Anyway.

290
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,040
Apex update now.

291
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:58,540
I am so proud of myself that I did not leak the map.

292
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,160
I knew about the new map for a long time.

293
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:04,800
Like...

294
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:10,160
So, I'm very proud of myself that I did not leak it.

295
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:13,620
I wanted to talk about it, but I couldn't.

296
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:18,020
But I knew about this map for a while now.

297
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,660
How long ago?

298
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,140
Well...

299
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:23,600
It was during...

300
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,260
Because like, the test for this map was during...

301
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:29,740
What's her name?

302
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:31,960
What the fuck is her name again?

303
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,100
Zicalis?

304
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,060
Shield girl.

305
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,500
Whoa!

306
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,460
Oh, so different.

307
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,380
Sorry, I should...

308
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:47,040
I stopped like...

309
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:47,660
Conduit!

310
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,460
God, I stopped caring about their names.

311
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:50,420
There's just too many now.

312
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:52,740
I stopped...

313
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:55,360
I just called them by nicknames now.

314
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,060
There's too...

315
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:56,520
I...

316
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,520
Guys, my mind is mush, guys.

317
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:01,860
So, like, I stopped caring about remembering names.

318
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:09,700
So, that new map has been teased for us since Conduit playtesting.

319
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:13,500
So, that's how long ago this new map's been in development.

320
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:18,280
So, I had to keep that secret for a very long time.

321
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:23,440
Because I knew about it during Conduit's playtest.

322
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,980
Because it was done at the same time.

323
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:26,820
Uh...

324
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,220
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

325
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,360
So, that's why I was like...

326
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,480
I was like, I'm so happy it's finally out.

327
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:37,780
So, I don't have to like think about it anymore.

328
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,460
I don't have to think about like...

329
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:40,720
Uh...

330
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,920
So, I meant Conduit, not Catalyst.

331
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,260
So, I don't have to like think about like...

332
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:48,900
Try and make sure I don't accidentally leak the new map.

333
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,640
Because I accidentally leaked some game modes in the past before.

334
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,120
But I stopped myself.

335
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:56,060
I never like actually leaked anything.

336
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:59,940
I once like almost very close, but I stopped myself.

337
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:05,360
Anyway, they nerfed aim assist by apparently a lot.

338
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,580
Like, I mean it's like 10 to 20%.

339
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:10,120
10 to 15%, I think.

340
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:14,240
So, they nerfed aim assist and made it so that...

341
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,320
Um...

342
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,700
So that, uh...

343
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:22,080
If you're from PlayOnConsole, you have like a 10% nerf or something.

344
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,220
I don't fucking know.

345
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:24,360
Like, I should just...

346
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,640
I should actually read the patch notes.

347
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,160
Guys, I'm a professional.

348
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:27,520
Okay.

349
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,780
Ipex Legends!

350
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,860
Patch notes!

351
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,380
And then...

352
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,780
25% for PC.

353
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:36,940
So, you're playing on controller on PC.

354
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:39,360
Your aim assist gets nerfed by 25%.

355
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,020
Thank fucking...

356
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:42,540
Thank...

357
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:43,520
Oh my god.

358
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,200
I'm gonna see how hard it's gonna hit.

359
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:45,720
Like...

360
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,960
Bye, ELO.

361
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:48,240
Um...

362
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,140
No, they nerfed console too.

363
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,400
I was reading it.

364
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:52,620
Um...

365
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:54,440
I even sent a link to it.

366
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:55,160
Uh...

367
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,000
What was it?

368
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,620
Where the fuck did I link it?

369
00:23:59,480 --> 00:23:59,980
Uh...

370
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,340
Cause I was reading the patch notes.

371
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:01,680
The patch...

372
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:01,960
The...

373
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:02,200
Okay.

374
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:03,320
Console crossplay.

375
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:06,800
It's only if it's console and you're in a PC lobby.

376
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:08,460
Which is basically my lobby.

377
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:09,500
And your...

378
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:12,660
Your aim assist got reduced by 18%.

379
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:17,200
So, if you're on console and you queue into my fucking lobbies, like...

380
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:21,260
18%.

381
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,960
It's reduced by 18%.

382
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,620
And usually in my lobbies, a lot of this is like...

383
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:27,960
Um...

384
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:28,760
What's that word?

385
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:29,900
It's like...

386
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:30,640
Reflex now.

387
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:31,240
You know?

388
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:31,320
Reflex.

389
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:31,620
Like...

390
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:32,840
What's that word when you're...

391
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:33,460
Uh...

392
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:35,260
When you're playing for a while and then like...

393
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:36,240
It's just...

394
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:36,720
Um...

395
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,840
It's just inner instinct.

396
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,140
By then.

397
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,060
So like...

398
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:41,420
Because it's not adjusted.

399
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,200
It got adjusted.

400
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:44,720
Uh...

401
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,540
No, not habit.

402
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:46,220
Is it instinct?

403
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:46,960
Muscle memory.

404
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:47,300
Yes!

405
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:47,940
Muscle memory.

406
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:51,080
That's gonna fuck up with a lot of people's muscle memory.

407
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,060
And that's what I'm gonna enjoy.

408
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,040
I don't know.

409
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,800
Maybe I'm still gonna get shit on because I don't play as much anymore.

410
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:56,680
Cause I...

411
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,660
I'm so busy.

412
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:58,720
But like...

413
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,200
I don't...

414
00:24:59,200 --> 00:24:59,460
I could like...

415
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:02,240
I could like talk shit right now and I'm gonna get shit on because...

416
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:05,140
But like...

417
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:08,420
What I'm hoping for is that...

418
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:11,560
What I'm hoping for is that...

419
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:16,000
A lot of console players and controller players right now...

420
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,880
It's affecting their muscle memory.

421
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,180
Because like...

422
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:19,720
You know...

423
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,580
One tiny adjustment fucks up...

424
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:22,120
Fucks you up.

425
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:22,460
Like...

426
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:23,780
I've had that happen so much.

427
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:26,280
Especially like changing senses and like...

428
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,880
Playing around with different senses.

429
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,320
Or like playing different games.

430
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:30,220
Um...

431
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:30,620
Back...

432
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:31,500
Like back to back.

433
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:32,880
And like you're not adjusting it.

434
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:33,940
So I'm hoping...

435
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:36,200
I'm hoping a lot of console and controller players...

436
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,040
Are like...

437
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,580
Having a rough time right now.

438
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,420
Adjusting to that nerf.

439
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:42,300
So...

440
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:43,340
So...

441
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,420
Let's see how that works.

442
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,400
Anyway, there's a new map.

443
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,180
It's a city.

444
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:49,320
Um...

445
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,760
It's a city and there's apparently...

446
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,120
There's a lot of high ground.

447
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,360
Um...

448
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:54,920
Let's see.

449
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,400
There's a new class perk for controller class.

450
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,260
What is it?

451
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,400
Zone overcharge.

452
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:04,140
Controller legends now have extra shield capacity when playing in zone.

453
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,460
The zone automatically grants...

454
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:07,320
What the fuck?

455
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:08,460
Okay, who's a controller?

456
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,040
Wait, what?

457
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:11,880
Oh!

458
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,440
So these guys will have extra shield.

459
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:15,340
Okay.

460
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:18,340
Yeah, they're gonna have extra shield when they're in zone.

461
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:19,240
Okay, what else?

462
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:20,520
Uh...

463
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,760
Cast with permanent when the...

464
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,580
Okay, if you're in zone, you have 25 extra shield.

465
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:25,640
Uh...

466
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,620
And you can heal this.

467
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:27,300
Okay.

468
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,300
Okay.

469
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,040
Uh...

470
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:32,080
Okay, that's it.

471
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:32,820
Oh, but...

472
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:35,380
If you have red armor, it doesn't matter.

473
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:36,420
Okay.

474
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:38,900
That's a little bit broken, but okay.

475
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,220
I mean, okay.

476
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,260
What else?

477
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:45,860
Oh, everybody has a new class.

478
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:47,320
Wait, they read...

479
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,020
Adjusted stuff.

480
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,340
Okay, let's see.

481
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,320
Recon legends can now gain threat vision when aiming down sight.

482
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,960
Threat vision will highlight enemies that the character has.

483
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,380
Line of sight to whatever you want.

484
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,720
I don't know.

485
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,700
How is that helpful?

486
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:12,980
Like, I can see them.

487
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,920
How is that?

488
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,280
I don't understand.

489
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,560
I guess like, I've never seen that as an issue before.

490
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:23,660
Aiming, that's for me?

491
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,880
But what if I'm blind?

492
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,620
Yeah, it doesn't work through walls or smoke.

493
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,140
So like...

494
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:34,500
I guess like, for those...

495
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,140
Because I'm just like...

496
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:37,580
Do I... I don't need that.

497
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:41,500
I'm just thinking, I guess people who don't play the game as...

498
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,260
I guess this is more like, beginner friendly.

499
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,180
Because like, when you...

500
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:47,580
When you can see people move.

501
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:49,360
Like, the moment they're moving, you can see them.

502
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,500
I guess...

503
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,020
Oh!

504
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:54,300
Rats.

505
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:56,360
You can use those to find rats.

506
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,480
I guess.

507
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,900
I think that would be really helpful for finding rats.

508
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,060
If it highlights enemies and you just look around.

509
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:05,340
You just like, randomly look around and then you'll see...

510
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:06,360
Like, it'll just glow.

511
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:07,680
But that fucking sucks.

512
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,460
Like, actually...

513
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:11,440
That fucking sucks.

514
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:13,140
Actually...

515
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:13,780
Um...

516
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:14,860
Survey beacon...

517
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:18,360
Shortening range of 500 meters when scanning the entire map.

518
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:22,780
No longer randomly distributed and all will now be turned on with every map scanning now.

519
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:23,360
Oh!

520
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,580
Survey beacons will be for everything.

521
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:26,440
Okay.

522
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,700
It'll grant less evil.

523
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:31,220
Alright, what else?

524
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,360
Stat trackers.

525
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:33,260
Shockwave.

526
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:34,300
Okay, we don't care about that.

527
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:35,340
Balances.

528
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:37,560
Eva 8 is back on the floor.

529
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:38,600
R9!

530
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:40,360
Oh, thank fucking god.

531
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:42,320
The R9 buffed.

532
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,860
Damage falloff?

533
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,180
On R9?

534
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:47,760
Bro, they casted it!

535
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:49,260
What?

536
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:50,460
Is that fair?

537
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,520
I don't play Apex for realism.

538
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,460
I don't...

539
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,240
Stop adding realism!

540
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:00,300
No one likes damage falloff.

541
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:04,420
Nobody ever likes damage falloff.

542
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,180
That shit fucking sucks.

543
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:10,480
Like, if you would add more realism, add blood.

544
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,760
Like, what?

545
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,760
Bro, that fucking sucks.

546
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,800
R9 was already nerfed.

547
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:18,660
Come on.

548
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:20,220
Um...

549
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:21,940
Oh yeah, and then you can have...

550
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:22,860
Uh...

551
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:23,700
You can have...

552
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,400
Apparently, you can have...

553
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,060
Uh...

554
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:28,400
Two pistols at the same time.

555
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:30,900
So, you can have Mozamm and...

556
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:33,020
I knew about that during the playtesting.

557
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:36,560
So, that's why I was really worried about leaking that as well.

558
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:38,000
I knew that from...

559
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,700
They've been playtesting that for a while.

560
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:41,180
Um...

561
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:42,980
Alright.

562
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:44,000
Is that it?

563
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,480
Is that everything?

564
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:47,800
Uh...

565
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,720
Buh buh buh...

566
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,220
Buh buh...

567
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:49,900
Dual wield...

568
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:50,560
LMGs...

569
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:50,960
Alright!

570
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:51,800
Let's go!

571
00:29:55,410 --> 00:29:57,630
Oh, they redid the spread for shotgun.

572
00:29:57,950 --> 00:29:58,630
Is that everything?

573
00:29:58,850 --> 00:29:59,530
Important?

574
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:04,570
Guys, is there anything else I should know?

575
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:06,590
Uh...

576
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:07,310
Oh!

577
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:08,210
Crypto!

578
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:10,230
Crypto becomes cloaked when in drone?

579
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:11,530
What the fuck?

580
00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:14,270
Is crypto...

581
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:16,730
They made invisible crypto!

582
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:18,750
They...

583
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:19,190
What?

584
00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:21,090
They made invisible?

585
00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:22,730
Crypto!

586
00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:23,930
Crypto!

587
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:23,990
Oh!

588
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:25,470
All LMGs now...

589
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:25,670
Oh!

590
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:26,590
New hop-up.

591
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:27,830
Gun shield generator?

592
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:30,230
What the fuck?

593
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:31,910
What do I need?

594
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:33,470
He's off the grid!

595
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:35,990
Oh my god!

596
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:37,630
They bugged Crypto!

597
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:37,850
Yeah!

598
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:39,090
He's invisible now.

599
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:41,090
Went hidden from sight.

600
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:41,650
Okay.

601
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:42,170
Alright.

602
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:43,110
You can't see that.

603
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:43,450
Is there...

604
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:43,730
What else?

605
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:45,370
Um...

606
00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:48,750
I wish all crypto is invisible.

607
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:51,610
I wish crypto was invisible twenty-four.

608
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:51,990
Number seven.

609
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:54,090
Alright, what other stuff that's new?

610
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:56,150
Guys, oh my god!

611
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:57,990
This in- what the fuck?

612
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:01,170
Everything now regenerates shield charge?

613
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:04,630
Wait, power pylon now regenerates shield charge?

614
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:07,170
Um, so does that mean...

615
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:09,470
Uhhhh...

616
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:14,670
Does that mean like, faster and more resilient?

617
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:19,370
Wait, does that mean like, it doesn't- Oh, it regenerates the shield charge for...

618
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:20,470
Uh...

619
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:22,310
25- Oh, the controller stuff.

620
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:22,890
Yeah, yeah.

621
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:25,410
I was gonna say, like, oh I thought they meant like, in general.

622
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:26,590
I was like, no, that's fucked up.

623
00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:30,130
Uh, no longer requires LS2 echo to launch?

624
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:30,450
Oh!

625
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:34,410
You don't have to look at- You don't have to look at echo anymore.

626
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:35,030
That's nice.

627
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:38,110
Jesus Christ, there's so much shit.

628
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:40,130
Like, there's so much!

629
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:43,750
I'm like, reading through it, I'm like, what the fuck?

630
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:46,170
There's so many changes.

631
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:51,330
Yeah, I- I was gonna say, I thought it meant like, it never runs out.

632
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:53,990
That's what I thought for the Watson upgrade.

633
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:56,010
I was like, there's no fucking way they just did that.

634
00:31:57,090 --> 00:32:00,610
Alright, let's go to the training range.

635
00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:01,730
Oh, bot royale.

636
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:03,710
Let's go to the firing range real fast.

637
00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:06,150
So I can check out some of the new updates.

638
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:10,790
Let's see.

639
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:12,270
Alright.

640
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:15,270
Let's try it out.

641
00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:18,330
Alright, uh...

642
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:19,470
Uh, Bot Royale.

643
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:24,030
Bot Royale is basically for, you know in the tutorial, you get to play with bots.

644
00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:28,810
Uh, like you have to play like, several games with bots.

645
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:30,790
That's just that, but now you can choose it.

646
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:39,370
Now like people can, uh, do, uh, highlights and like, frag videos with Bot Royale, and people won't know.

647
00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:48,070
They can, now they can fake the bot, they can fake cool, uh, montages in Bot Royale.

648
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:48,890
Like...

649
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:53,510
That was a problem back then, I remember.

650
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:55,430
Alright, let's see, what's the hop-up?

651
00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:57,150
Oh, Gun Shield, okay.

652
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:00,010
Um...

653
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:02,570
Let's see...

654
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:05,050
It was Car, right?

655
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:06,010
Car has...

656
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:09,270
It's... Oh no, it was Elsa?

657
00:33:09,370 --> 00:33:10,210
Oh, Star has it?

658
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:12,850
Oh my god, it's Bastion!

659
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:14,330
It...

660
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:16,470
What the fuck?

661
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:21,150
Bro, does it re... Okay, you have to be ADS for it, okay.

662
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:25,350
Alright, I'm just thinking like, do you really need that though?

663
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:28,150
Oh my god, I'm Bastion!

664
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:30,230
I'm, I'm beta Bastion!

665
00:33:32,170 --> 00:33:33,090
Holy shit!

666
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:35,490
That's fucking crazy!

667
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:37,590
Oh my god!

668
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:39,310
Okay, who, which...

669
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:40,270
Other gun has it?

670
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:41,770
Uh...

671
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:44,790
Rampage?

672
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:45,630
No!

673
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:48,690
Rampage did not need that!

674
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:50,870
Rampage!

675
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:52,070
No!

676
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:53,430
Wait!

677
00:33:53,610 --> 00:33:55,470
Can I have double shield as Gibby?

678
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:57,070
Wait a minute!

679
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:59,550
Okay, let's see, it's Rampage...

680
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:00,990
And Spitfire.

681
00:34:01,050 --> 00:34:04,550
Oh no, Rampage and Spitfire does not need that!

682
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:06,730
It doesn't!

683
00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:07,490
Oh!

684
00:34:08,970 --> 00:34:09,450
Okay.

685
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:12,490
Alright, let's see.

686
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:13,570
Do I get double shield?

687
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:15,630
Does that mean I get double shield?

688
00:34:16,990 --> 00:34:20,710
Oh wait, no, I need to... I'm gonna grab Rampage.

689
00:34:22,910 --> 00:34:23,390
Oh!

690
00:34:23,390 --> 00:34:23,870
Oh!

691
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:25,390
Wait, it's gold!

692
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:25,850
Oh!

693
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:27,710
Wait!

694
00:34:28,390 --> 00:34:29,470
Oh my god!

695
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:31,830
Oh my god, take me now!

696
00:34:32,490 --> 00:34:35,010
Oh my god, I can snag... Oh my god!

697
00:34:35,970 --> 00:34:37,510
That's fucking crazy!

698
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:39,730
Holy shit, it's gold!

699
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:40,970
It's gold!

700
00:34:42,390 --> 00:34:44,050
Alright, let's see.

701
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:45,910
Um... Spitfire.

702
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:46,590
Alright.

703
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:47,870
Spitfire.

704
00:34:47,950 --> 00:34:49,590
Oh my god, it's gold!

705
00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:52,210
Get killed me now!

706
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:55,750
Oh god, Gibby is back!

707
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:57,870
Try LMG, Hitfire.

708
00:34:58,030 --> 00:34:59,370
It doesn't show up for Hitfire.

709
00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:00,970
See?

710
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:03,110
That doesn't show up.

711
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:05,590
It only shows up for ADS.

712
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:06,310
Oh!

713
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:08,830
Piss fights!

714
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:13,870
I love looking... I love looking through Apex and Pissvision.

715
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:22,110
Okay.

716
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:25,410
Um... LMG, Hitfire gets more accurate now.

717
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:26,130
Does it really?

718
00:35:27,090 --> 00:35:32,390
Oh, I... I don't use Hitfire that often on LMG.

719
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:33,710
So, it's hard to notice.

720
00:35:34,370 --> 00:35:37,090
I mean, I do when I'm like, literally like here.

721
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:40,010
But, I very rarely use it up here.

722
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:43,270
Because like I said, like you know, because Hitfire has been dog shit.

723
00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:44,490
I guess you're right.

724
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:46,370
I mean, it does feel like...

725
00:35:46,370 --> 00:35:48,630
It does feel like, you know...

726
00:35:50,330 --> 00:35:51,790
It does feel more accurate.

727
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:53,650
But like I said, I always do.

728
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:56,390
Uh... Wait, did the record go shrink?

729
00:35:58,430 --> 00:35:59,370
Oh, it did!

730
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:01,510
That's interesting!

731
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:02,970
Yeah!

732
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:04,290
That's interesting!

733
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:09,210
It is like more casual friendly.

734
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:10,190
Which makes sense.

735
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:12,290
Because it's the casuals that spend money.

736
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:18,730
I don't spend money on this game.

737
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:19,790
Why cater to me?

738
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:25,010
All I'm saying is I don't spend money.

739
00:36:25,370 --> 00:36:27,670
They have no reason to cater to me.

740
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:30,770
Alright, let's see.

741
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:34,230
Uh...

742
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:36,470
Someone said try devotion.

743
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:37,730
Alright.

744
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:38,790
What is devotion?

745
00:36:39,650 --> 00:36:41,210
Is it piss color too?

746
00:36:42,890 --> 00:36:43,610
Jesus.

747
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:46,510
It's just get bouncing.

748
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:48,970
Don't say that!

749
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:49,850
It's fine.

750
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:50,730
Say it.

751
00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:52,990
It's okay.

752
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:54,270
I'm for the people.

753
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:57,350
My opinions reflect the casuals too.

754
00:36:57,610 --> 00:36:58,930
Guys, don't worry.

755
00:36:59,370 --> 00:37:00,730
I'm just like you guys now.

756
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:01,950
I'm just like you guys.

757
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:06,050
Alright.

758
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:08,350
The sponsors.

759
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:10,390
Alright.

760
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:15,390
It's because the sponsors treat me so well.

761
00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:17,010
That I never have to spend money anymore.

762
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:19,530
Oh my god.

763
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:20,790
The reticle thing?

764
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:22,110
But like...

765
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:24,710
I would still like...

766
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:27,250
I would still like aim with...

767
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:28,550
Aim with this.

768
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:31,270
Yeah, I still aim with ADS though.

769
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:35,490
I hope the game volume has been...

770
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:38,490
Alright, I'll make sure the game volume is okay.

771
00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:40,650
Alright, what other stuff they did?

772
00:37:40,870 --> 00:37:41,230
Oh yeah!

773
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:43,470
Invisible Crypto.

774
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:47,010
Am I invisible?

775
00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:49,470
How do I... enter.

776
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:51,090
You can tell I don't play Crypto.

777
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:51,830
Where am I?

778
00:37:52,810 --> 00:37:53,830
Wait, how do I...

779
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:58,140
No, I see myself.

780
00:37:58,620 --> 00:37:59,400
It's fucked up.

781
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:00,260
I can see myself.

782
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,920
So like, I guess like...

783
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:03,900
They can't see this.

784
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:06,040
If I stand in the middle...

785
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,520
Does that mean they don't see me?

786
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:08,580
Like...

787
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,220
If I just...

788
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:13,600
Oh, I have to upgrade!

789
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:14,420
Okay.

790
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:15,840
Where is it?

791
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:17,580
Oh, off the grid!

792
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,080
What was it before?

793
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:20,760
What was it?

794
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,180
I don't even use...

795
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:22,480
Oh wait.

796
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:23,820
Watch me disappear, guys.

797
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:27,680
Wait, I still see me.

798
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:28,780
What is this?

799
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:31,960
Okay.

800
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:32,460
Okay.

801
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:33,460
Scout's drone.

802
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:34,120
Scanned.

803
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:34,800
Persists through.

804
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:35,920
Do they change any of these?

805
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:36,740
I guess not.

806
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:41,940
Alright, so I could literally um, get out, and go back in.

807
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:42,300
Okay.

808
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:43,200
Alright.

809
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:45,620
Off the grid...

810
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:46,840
Aaahhhhhhhh!

811
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:48,460
You guys wanna see a magic trick?

812
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,820
Where did he go?

813
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:53,420
Where did he go?!

814
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,060
Wooooooo!

815
00:38:59,120 --> 00:38:59,680
Where is here?

816
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:00,240
Where did she go?

817
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,440
Where did Toki go?

818
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,680
She went off the grid!

819
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:05,180
She burned off her fingerprints!

820
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:06,520
She's gone!

821
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:08,980
African tabra!

822
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,040
Oh my god!

823
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,020
Her fingerprints are gone!

824
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:15,400
Oh my god!

825
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,100
Oh my god!

826
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:19,160
I don't want to play crypto and just stand in the middle of a fight.

827
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,300
I don't want to play crypto and just stand in the middle of a fight.

828
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:21,920
African tabra!

829
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:22,960
African tabra!

830
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:26,260
She escaped in front of her eyes.

831
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:29,700
What if I just...

832
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:30,640
Oh my god!

833
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,400
What if I hide a drone?

834
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:37,740
I go into a rat spot, I put my drone out, and just...

835
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,860
Okay, but I feel like people are going to see my drone and just shoot.

836
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:45,820
And then just actively try to find me because of it.

837
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:49,740
No carbon footprint drone.

838
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,580
I would absolutely die.

839
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:58,640
Despite how confident I sound right now, I know if I do that in a real game, I'd get absolutely shit on.

840
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:00,640
Like, hide the drone.

841
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,860
Dude, the drone was scammed no matter what!

842
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:06,840
And then when they hear the scan, people are going to be like, Drone!

843
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,200
And then they'll see me.

844
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:10,440
They'll kill the drone and then they'll see me.

845
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:12,160
Like, what the fuck?

846
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:13,880
What else?

847
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:14,760
Is there anything else?

848
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,900
Is there anything else I'm missing?

849
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,140
Yeah, Bloodhour run me down.

850
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,060
That is so true.

851
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,060
It's like...

852
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:28,500
Is that?

853
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:29,700
Oh, that's the highlight?

854
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,220
Well, that shit sucks.

855
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:35,640
Sorry, hate.

856
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:36,400
I don't like that.

857
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,120
I don't like that.

858
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,340
It feels like I'm down learning.

859
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,060
Oh, the Akeem.

860
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:42,340
Yeah.

861
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:44,340
I forgot about the dual weapon.

862
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:45,880
What is it?

863
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,460
Is it a hop-up or...

864
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:49,900
Uh...

865
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:52,140
Oh no, I can just grab two right now.

866
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:53,160
Wow!

867
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,220
Oh, it takes one slide?

868
00:40:59,970 --> 00:41:00,570
Alright.

869
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:01,850
Okay.

870
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:03,150
Holy shit!

871
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:03,910
Merry Christmas!

872
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:08,890
Merry Christmas!

873
00:41:10,430 --> 00:41:12,930
Okay, so I can do shotgun and...

874
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:13,810
Okay, no.

875
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:15,770
Only shot... double shotguns.

876
00:41:15,770 --> 00:41:15,990
Okay.

877
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:17,210
Dual Mozamb.

878
00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:20,090
Jesus Christ.

879
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:20,470
Okay.

880
00:41:20,890 --> 00:41:22,570
I don't like the dual Mozamb.

881
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:24,230
The dual Mozamb feels fucking weird.

882
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:25,610
ADS style.

883
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:27,090
I think like...

884
00:41:27,090 --> 00:41:28,970
I think hipfire is okay.

885
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:31,210
But definitely the ADS...

886
00:41:31,210 --> 00:41:32,650
ADS feels weird.

887
00:41:32,770 --> 00:41:33,190
I think.

888
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:36,430
I think the ADS feels a little weird.

889
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:38,710
Uh...

890
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:39,690
Nice.

891
00:41:40,090 --> 00:41:41,490
You only do pistols.

892
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:42,330
Uh...

893
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:44,770
It's P20 and Mozamb, right?

894
00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:46,310
You only do... yeah.

895
00:41:46,450 --> 00:41:48,370
You only do P20 and Mozamb.

896
00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:51,030
But like, one or the other.

897
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:53,190
Now do it with attachments.

898
00:41:53,690 --> 00:41:54,530
Ooh, true.

899
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:56,310
Let's see.

900
00:41:56,410 --> 00:41:56,930
Do I need...

901
00:41:57,090 --> 00:41:57,430
double?

902
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:01,070
No, I just need one!

903
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:01,410
Oh!

904
00:42:01,570 --> 00:42:02,270
I just need one!

905
00:42:02,470 --> 00:42:02,930
That's good.

906
00:42:03,090 --> 00:42:03,550
Nice.

907
00:42:03,810 --> 00:42:05,050
And then...

908
00:42:05,050 --> 00:42:05,990
Ooh, hammerpoint.

909
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:06,890
That sounds broken.

910
00:42:07,570 --> 00:42:08,090
Alright.

911
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:11,470
Jesus Christ.

912
00:42:11,850 --> 00:42:12,370
Okay.

913
00:42:15,970 --> 00:42:16,490
Alright.

914
00:42:16,810 --> 00:42:19,190
That shit seems very broken.

915
00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:21,230
Holy fuck!

916
00:42:21,850 --> 00:42:24,370
If I find a hammerpoint, it's over.

917
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:27,070
It's fucking over.

918
00:42:30,610 --> 00:42:31,230
Jesus.

919
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:33,970
That's scary.

920
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:36,610
That's scary.

921
00:42:36,610 --> 00:42:37,170
That's actually scary.

922
00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:39,030
Oh my god.

923
00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:39,370
Wait.

924
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:40,070
Let's see.

925
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:41,230
Double hammerpoint.

926
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:42,530
Uh...

927
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:43,870
Alright.

928
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:44,310
Let's see.

929
00:42:44,370 --> 00:42:45,230
Where's the...

930
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:46,690
Is that everything?

931
00:42:46,850 --> 00:42:47,390
After that?

932
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:48,490
Or is there...

933
00:42:48,490 --> 00:42:50,070
anything else I'm missing, guys?

934
00:42:53,110 --> 00:42:53,730
Jeez.

935
00:42:53,930 --> 00:42:54,570
That's fast.

936
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:56,630
That's fast if I have hammer...

937
00:42:57,090 --> 00:42:58,250
Get the...

938
00:42:59,050 --> 00:43:00,310
If I get shield out...

939
00:43:00,310 --> 00:43:01,750
And then...

940
00:43:03,050 --> 00:43:04,490
That shit is fast.

941
00:43:05,130 --> 00:43:05,730
Ooh!

942
00:43:06,410 --> 00:43:08,050
That shit is so fast.

943
00:43:08,490 --> 00:43:10,750
Yeah, like I said, it's very beginner...

944
00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:12,370
casual friendly, which is nice.

945
00:43:14,190 --> 00:43:14,790
Ooh!

946
00:43:14,910 --> 00:43:15,950
That damage!

947
00:43:16,330 --> 00:43:17,370
I like that.

948
00:43:18,050 --> 00:43:19,290
I like that damage.

949
00:43:19,870 --> 00:43:20,470
Okay.

950
00:43:21,910 --> 00:43:23,330
This is OGR9.

951
00:43:23,490 --> 00:43:25,330
It feels like OGR9.

952
00:43:27,010 --> 00:43:27,650
Wait.

953
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:28,730
Vantage has a passive?

954
00:43:30,170 --> 00:43:31,210
That's disgusting.

955
00:43:32,370 --> 00:43:33,010
That's disgusting.

956
00:43:33,830 --> 00:43:36,470
This feels like OGR9 now.

957
00:43:37,310 --> 00:43:37,770
This feels like OGR9 now.

958
00:43:37,770 --> 00:43:38,310
Yeah.

959
00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:39,090
That shit melts.

960
00:43:39,390 --> 00:43:40,230
It does.

961
00:43:40,990 --> 00:43:42,250
Oh my god!

962
00:43:42,270 --> 00:43:43,530
That's so fast!

963
00:43:44,470 --> 00:43:45,610
Oh my god!

964
00:43:45,610 --> 00:43:45,610
That's so fast!

965
00:43:45,610 --> 00:43:47,350
That's actually so fast.

966
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:52,040
Yeah.

967
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:53,580
The further you get...

968
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:56,100
The further you get, the sadder I become.

969
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:56,580
The further you get, the sadder I become.

970
00:43:59,260 --> 00:43:59,980
...

971
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:00,420
...

972
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:07,600
...

973
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:07,720
...

974
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:08,880
...

975
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:09,360
...

976
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:19,640
Alright!

977
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:22,160
Uh.

978
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:24,680
That's basically a shotgun now for me.

979
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:25,500
Uh.

980
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:28,560
What was the Vantage change?

981
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,300
I didn't pay attention to Vantage.

982
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:31,640
Because I don't play her.

983
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,560
Alright, what did they change on her?

984
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:39,860
Let's see, refresh tactical... I don't even know if these were the same ones.

985
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:43,580
Like I don't... I don't even know.

986
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:47,120
I know like they adjusted the pattern.

987
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:49,780
What did they change?

988
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:55,120
What did they change on second ult hits deals more damage?

989
00:44:57,180 --> 00:44:58,580
Okay, can we replace her?

990
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:00,960
She gets a shield scan regardless of scope?

991
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:03,160
Oh.

992
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:05,920
So...

993
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:08,600
I mean...

994
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:12,340
Two shot... second shot is 125.

995
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:13,460
Oh, okay.

996
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:15,840
Is it?

997
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:18,200
Oh, it is!

998
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:19,800
Oh, that shit's strong.

999
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:21,640
I don't even know what to play.

1000
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:25,220
They made so many changes.

1001
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:27,000
I don't know like what character to play.

1002
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:30,340
Alright, let me see my frames real fast.

1003
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,160
I think I'm... am I frame dropping?

1004
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:32,880
I can't tell.

1005
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:36,120
Uh, where is the perf...

1006
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:37,780
Wait, my performance display is on.

1007
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:38,100
Oh.

1008
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:39,940
Sorry, I didn't see it.

1009
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:41,580
Guys.

1010
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:44,920
I'm a mess.

1011
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:47,000
It was like, oh it is already on.

1012
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:50,780
Alright, I don't know who to play.

1013
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:52,440
I actually don't know.

1014
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:53,700
They changed so many things.

1015
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:54,360
I don't know.

1016
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:56,740
I... I'm... I'm bad with decisions!

1017
00:45:57,860 --> 00:45:59,500
I'm so bad with decisions!

1018
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:03,700
Alright, uh...

1019
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:05,000
Trios revival?

1020
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:06,140
Oh.

1021
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:07,140
What's revival?

1022
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:09,260
You made me down but you're not out.

1023
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:11,640
When you're killed, you can automatically return to the fight.

1024
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:12,600
Well, oh automatically.

1025
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:13,560
But don't get...

1026
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:14,940
Uh, automatic respawn.

1027
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,500
Stop working late in the match.

1028
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:18,080
Oh, so everybody just keeps coming back?

1029
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:19,680
Over and over and over again?

1030
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:21,080
Jesus Christ.

1031
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:21,500
What?

1032
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:22,300
What?

1033
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:22,660
What?

1034
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:26,900
You respawn at the end of a lockout time if at least one of your teammates is still standing.

1035
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:28,740
The lockout timer can be decreased with smart plays.

1036
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:31,500
Like surviving teammates doing damage on the ground.

1037
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:33,060
Wait, why wait?

1038
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:36,060
Players can pick up downed teammates even faster in revival mode.

1039
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:36,880
What the fuck?

1040
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:39,740
That shit's like...

1041
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:44,940
That shit's like on steroids.

1042
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:45,520
Like what?

1043
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:46,320
That's like...

1044
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:46,960
Uh...

1045
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:51,260
Oh my god.

1046
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:55,200
That's basically like that other game mode.

1047
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:56,760
But they just pump like...

1048
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:58,720
Five gallons of steroids on it.

1049
00:46:58,880 --> 00:46:59,240
Like...

1050
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:01,720
Holy fuck.

1051
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:02,920
Yeah.

1052
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:05,120
Bro, that's not...

1053
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:06,540
Yeah, that's some easy 4k.

1054
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:07,100
Like...

1055
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:08,140
Like what's the other...

1056
00:47:08,140 --> 00:47:08,620
The last...

1057
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:09,440
That other game mode?

1058
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:10,000
Three strikes.

1059
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:11,780
This is literally three strikes.

1060
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:12,520
But like...

1061
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:14,980
What if we just remove all the strikes?

1062
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:19,340
What if we just...

1063
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:23,020
But what if we have like no strikes at all?

1064
00:47:24,860 --> 00:47:26,360
That's fucking crazy.

1065
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:26,880
And like...

1066
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:28,900
Nobody's gonna be down.

1067
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:29,880
Like...

1068
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:31,460
About the fast...

1069
00:47:31,460 --> 00:47:32,000
No, it is!

1070
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:32,980
It's a fast res!

1071
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:36,660
Down players even faster in revival mode.

1072
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:39,820
Like three strikes over infinite strikes.

1073
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:40,780
It does look...

1074
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:42,000
It says fast res here.

1075
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:44,300
Unless I'm reading it wrong.

1076
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:45,560
I could be reading it wrong.

1077
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:50,500
Because it says can pick up down teammates even faster in revival.

1078
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:53,820
It's the end of the rat race.

1079
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:55,120
Oh.

1080
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:55,640
Hahaha.

1081
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:56,140
Hahaha.

1082
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:56,820
Hahaha.

1083
00:47:56,820 --> 00:47:58,820
Oh the time to revive gets progressively longer?

1084
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:00,280
Alright, let's see.

1085
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,160
Alright, I feel like since...

1086
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:03,200
Since it's like...

1087
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:04,640
Ultra lifeline.

1088
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,540
I wanna see what the revive is.

1089
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:07,720
If it's fast or not.

1090
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:08,640
We'll see if the...

1091
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:08,780
Fast.

1092
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:10,100
If the revives are fast.

1093
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:11,900
I'll be right back real quick before I queue.

1094
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:13,880
Actually no, I can queue up while I...

1095
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:15,560
I need to get tissues to blow my nose.

1096
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:16,100
I'll be right back.

1097
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:36,800
What is an instant?

1098
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:40,440
I can't believe my game is already dying.

1099
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:41,340
Hahaha.

1100
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:42,420
Hahaha.

1101
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:43,540
Hahaha.

1102
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:44,020
Hahaha.

1103
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:44,360
Hahaha.

1104
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:44,680
Hahaha.

1105
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:44,900
Hahaha.

1106
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:44,960
Hahaha.

1107
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:45,660
Hahaha.

1108
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:47,600
I can't believe it.

1109
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:49,060
Not an instant queue.

1110
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:49,980
Hahaha.

1111
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:51,980
Hahaha.

1112
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:58,140
Update literally came out three hours ago and I didn't get an instant queue.

1113
00:48:59,060 --> 00:48:59,620
Hahaha.

1114
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:03,500
Welcome back.

1115
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:04,520
Hahaha.

1116
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:08,360
Alright, here we go.

1117
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:09,900
E-district.

1118
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:13,740
I'm surprised they just were forced to do this mode.

1119
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:14,960
I would just like to play it regular.

1120
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:15,900
Not gonna lie.

1121
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:20,300
I sort of just wanna play it regular game mode.

1122
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:23,160
I don't wanna play three strikes on steroids.

1123
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:24,060
Hahaha.

1124
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:28,620
I feel like I'm gonna get so overwhelmed.

1125
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:29,700
Hahaha.

1126
00:49:35,410 --> 00:49:36,510
Alright, here we go.

1127
00:49:38,170 --> 00:49:39,530
Oh shit, invisible man.

1128
00:49:40,130 --> 00:49:41,050
He wants to do...

1129
00:49:41,050 --> 00:49:42,190
I'll do crypto after.

1130
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:50,040
Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's to survive.

1131
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:52,020
It's definitely for like survivability and stuff.

1132
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:53,440
For sure.

1133
00:49:54,860 --> 00:49:55,720
Also, hold on.

1134
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:57,080
Welcome to the tomato farm.

1135
00:49:57,180 --> 00:49:57,800
Welcome, welcome.

1136
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:01,280
I hate night maps.

1137
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:03,980
Wooo.

1138
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:06,700
Fucking hell, it's night time.

1139
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:08,060
I don't know.

1140
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:11,300
I don't like night maps because I'm fucking blind already.

1141
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:11,840
Hahaha.

1142
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:13,520
Hahaha.

1143
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:16,700
I'm already blind.

1144
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:18,900
I need the light.

1145
00:50:19,740 --> 00:50:20,300
Hahaha.

1146
00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:22,900
Hahaha.

1147
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:25,060
Alright, let's see.

1148
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:27,440
Cyberpunk density.

1149
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:28,540
Oh, I'm sorry.

1150
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:29,780
I fucking wear glasses.

1151
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:32,380
Like I'm already like fucked up genetically.

1152
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:33,980
When it comes to eyesight.

1153
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:34,880
Hahaha.

1154
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:36,240
Thank you for the gift.

1155
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:37,300
Thank you.

1156
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:38,920
Oh.

1157
00:50:44,380 --> 00:50:45,040
Oh my god.

1158
00:50:45,060 --> 00:50:47,920
I'm gonna get like shit on just for the fact that I don't know where I am.

1159
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:48,560
Like...

1160
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:49,260
Hahaha.

1161
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:50,160
Hahaha.

1162
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:53,880
I don't know where I am.

1163
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:55,560
Where am I?

1164
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:57,520
Okay.

1165
00:50:59,200 --> 00:50:59,720
Alright.

1166
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:01,460
Oh.

1167
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:03,620
Twelve enemies scanned.

1168
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:04,180
Oh.

1169
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:06,220
They're over there.

1170
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:07,060
What the fuck?

1171
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:09,600
Is this... this map feels small when I look.

1172
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:12,300
Isn't it like week one?

1173
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:13,420
Oh guys, recycle!

1174
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:15,940
Remember to recycle.

1175
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:17,040
Oh my god.

1176
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:17,600
Where am I?

1177
00:51:17,980 --> 00:51:18,920
Where am I?

1178
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:19,060
Hahaha.

1179
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:20,980
Oh.

1180
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:23,820
I played... Bro, okay.

1181
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:24,520
I like it.

1182
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:25,020
I told you guys.

1183
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:27,360
They play tested this for a long time ago.

1184
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:27,960
Hahaha.

1185
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:30,340
Like... I don't remember.

1186
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:32,100
It's been fucking months.

1187
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:33,200
Hahaha.

1188
00:51:35,020 --> 00:51:36,500
Looking at the...

1189
00:51:37,020 --> 00:51:37,500
Um...

1190
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:40,000
I want this just because it has the shield thing.

1191
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:41,460
No, that doesn't have the shield thing.

1192
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:43,080
Um...

1193
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:45,700
I don't know what guns... Ooh.

1194
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:46,160
Okay.

1195
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:47,520
If I find another Mozamm.

1196
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:48,640
It's on.

1197
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:50,920
God, there's so much stuff.

1198
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:52,640
There's so much stuff.

1199
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:53,880
I'm getting overwhelmed already.

1200
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:57,040
Alright.

1201
00:51:57,740 --> 00:51:58,560
Oh my god.

1202
00:51:58,620 --> 00:51:59,640
Oh, I'm in somebody's apartment.

1203
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:01,200
Welcome to my crib.

1204
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:02,620
This is where I'm moving, guys.

1205
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:04,400
This is... Hahaha.

1206
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:05,980
Alright.

1207
00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:06,880
Play with team.

1208
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:07,560
Girl, the... Wait.

1209
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:08,080
What the fuck?

1210
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:09,500
He's the one that's not playing with team.

1211
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:13,020
Bro, you can't just say play with team and run away from team.

1212
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:14,560
Oh my god.

1213
00:52:14,580 --> 00:52:15,020
Where am I?

1214
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:15,880
Hahaha.

1215
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:17,160
Hahaha.

1216
00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:20,500
Where... Where am I?

1217
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:21,220
Hahaha.

1218
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:22,620
There's so many...

1219
00:52:22,620 --> 00:52:24,880
There's so many hiding places here.

1220
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:27,560
Like, imagine all the rats here.

1221
00:52:28,060 --> 00:52:28,860
Oh my god.

1222
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:29,560
There's parking?

1223
00:52:31,180 --> 00:52:31,860
What?

1224
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:33,040
Hello.

1225
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:34,960
Oh, he has the double door.

1226
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:36,480
Oh my god.

1227
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:38,640
Guys, you can park.

1228
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:39,700
Hahaha.

1229
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:44,000
Oh my god.

1230
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:46,980
Look at this.

1231
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:48,460
This guy has like nice art.

1232
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:49,900
Look, there's cars!

1233
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:51,520
There's a taxi!

1234
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:55,100
Uber hasn't been invented yet in this world!

1235
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:57,280
That's fucked.

1236
00:52:57,560 --> 00:52:58,560
That's... Hahaha.

1237
00:52:58,980 --> 00:52:59,360
Hahaha.

1238
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:01,560
Oh no!

1239
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:03,460
They have a monopoly!

1240
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,340
Oh my god.

1241
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:08,380
Oh my god.

1242
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:11,140
Cars exist in the world of Apex.

1243
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:12,140
Who would've thought?

1244
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:14,380
Who would've fucking thought?

1245
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:16,600
Uber was never...

1246
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:20,820
They live in a dark era where Uber was not invented yet.

1247
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:21,760
Hahaha.

1248
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:26,420
They have everything but Ubers.

1249
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:29,220
What the fuck is wrong with them?

1250
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:30,560
What the fuck is wrong with them?

1251
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:31,520
Cars aren't even hovering!

1252
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:33,140
They have to use wheels!

1253
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:35,520
Wait, what?

1254
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:36,460
I thought...

1255
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:38,040
What happened to the hover cars?

1256
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:42,960
Wait, where is this world?

1257
00:53:43,060 --> 00:53:44,580
There's no hover cars anywhere!

1258
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:45,860
Hahaha.

1259
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:47,380
There's wheels!

1260
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:50,080
That's so fucked!

1261
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:50,720
Hahaha.

1262
00:53:53,740 --> 00:53:55,140
That's so messed up.

1263
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:56,580
I got the gun shield generator.

1264
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:59,400
But I haven't found any...

1265
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:01,840
Like, any of the LMGs.

1266
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:05,040
Only Olympus had hover cars.

1267
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:06,820
Olympus was clearly more developed.

1268
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:09,080
Well, I would...

1269
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:09,580
Oh.

1270
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:11,020
Oh shit.

1271
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:12,260
Oh, it's two teams.

1272
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:12,580
Okay.

1273
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:13,900
Ohhhh.

1274
00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:15,640
Cool down, increase, revive.

1275
00:54:17,380 --> 00:54:18,240
Alright, let's go.

1276
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:20,840
I need to remember it's...

1277
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:21,400
Oh my god!

1278
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:22,960
Oh my god, they're...

1279
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:24,620
He's in visible mode too.

1280
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,360
Don't worry, I'm gonna do something dumb.

1281
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:27,780
Like always.

1282
00:54:33,110 --> 00:54:33,590
Hahaha.

1283
00:54:34,610 --> 00:54:35,090
Hahaha.

1284
00:54:36,050 --> 00:54:37,030
Anyway, I want loot.

1285
00:54:37,470 --> 00:54:37,950
Hahaha.

1286
00:54:41,470 --> 00:54:41,950
Alright.

1287
00:54:42,390 --> 00:54:43,990
Oh my god, it's green now!

1288
00:54:44,390 --> 00:54:45,370
I don't like that.

1289
00:54:47,830 --> 00:54:49,650
Alright, I don't need any of this.

1290
00:54:49,970 --> 00:54:50,950
I'm like always...

1291
00:54:50,950 --> 00:54:52,170
I'm confused on what to loot.

1292
00:54:52,390 --> 00:54:53,810
I'm so...

1293
00:54:53,810 --> 00:54:57,330
I'm so confused on what to loot, not gonna lie.

1294
00:54:57,650 --> 00:54:58,090
Like...

1295
00:54:58,090 --> 00:55:00,770
I'm so overwhelmed with all the stuff they have.

1296
00:55:01,470 --> 00:55:03,590
So it's like, what do I even loot?

1297
00:55:04,470 --> 00:55:05,230
Alright, let's go.

1298
00:55:06,950 --> 00:55:09,530
Guys, as long as one of you lives, that's all that matters.

1299
00:55:09,670 --> 00:55:10,010
Wow!

1300
00:55:11,050 --> 00:55:12,350
I needed that actually.

1301
00:55:14,750 --> 00:55:15,190
Nice.

1302
00:55:16,470 --> 00:55:17,270
Alright, let's go.

1303
00:55:17,910 --> 00:55:19,290
Trust your instinct.

1304
00:55:19,610 --> 00:55:21,930
Yeah, but what if my instinct is wrong?

1305
00:55:22,410 --> 00:55:23,510
Oh shit!

1306
00:55:23,630 --> 00:55:23,890
Hello.

1307
00:55:24,910 --> 00:55:25,950
Oh shit!

1308
00:55:27,030 --> 00:55:27,970
I'm gonna throw you.

1309
00:55:28,210 --> 00:55:29,490
Just cause I can.

1310
00:55:31,790 --> 00:55:32,430
Alright.

1311
00:55:32,690 --> 00:55:33,630
He doesn't know.

1312
00:55:34,130 --> 00:55:35,370
He doesn't know.

1313
00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:40,170
He doesn't fucking know.

1314
00:55:41,290 --> 00:55:42,650
Wait, where's the other one?

1315
00:55:43,870 --> 00:55:45,170
Haha, no fear!

1316
00:55:45,430 --> 00:55:45,970
Wait.

1317
00:55:47,290 --> 00:55:47,710
They're spawning?

1318
00:55:48,010 --> 00:55:49,590
Oh, you don't thirst them.

1319
00:55:49,750 --> 00:55:51,370
I guess I shouldn't have rethirsted them.

1320
00:55:54,270 --> 00:55:54,970
That's bad.

1321
00:55:55,410 --> 00:55:56,770
We should have kept them down.

1322
00:55:57,970 --> 00:55:58,490
No!

1323
00:56:01,090 --> 00:56:02,190
Inspect the Mozamb?

1324
00:56:02,350 --> 00:56:02,750
Okay.

1325
00:56:04,070 --> 00:56:04,870
What is it?

1326
00:56:06,490 --> 00:56:07,330
What am I doing?

1327
00:56:08,290 --> 00:56:09,210
What am I...

1328
00:56:09,210 --> 00:56:10,810
Oh, okay!

1329
00:56:11,270 --> 00:56:11,790
Wow!

1330
00:56:11,790 --> 00:56:12,790
Wow!

1331
00:56:15,110 --> 00:56:16,610
Bro, I'm fucking playing soccer!

1332
00:56:17,870 --> 00:56:19,190
Alright, let's see.

1333
00:56:19,530 --> 00:56:22,230
I need an LMG for my shield generator.

1334
00:56:25,210 --> 00:56:26,150
Let's see.

1335
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:28,810
We need an LMG.

1336
00:56:29,490 --> 00:56:31,270
Bro, look at those kicks though.

1337
00:56:33,290 --> 00:56:34,930
There's three other squads?

1338
00:56:35,930 --> 00:56:37,190
I'm so lost.

1339
00:56:37,630 --> 00:56:39,850
Hey, we can get some fucking coke.

1340
00:56:40,050 --> 00:56:40,810
Look at these.

1341
00:56:41,090 --> 00:56:41,770
What is this?

1342
00:56:41,770 --> 00:56:44,050
Oh, I'm in Japan.

1343
00:56:44,490 --> 00:56:49,710
Guys, I take back everything I said about like how they don't have hover cars.

1344
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:51,950
Like, wheels are just so much better, guys.

1345
00:56:52,150 --> 00:56:53,830
Wheels are... wheels are...

1346
00:56:53,830 --> 00:56:54,390
Hahaha!

1347
00:56:56,950 --> 00:56:57,510
Hahaha!

1348
00:56:58,610 --> 00:57:00,630
Guys, I take it back.

1349
00:57:00,710 --> 00:57:01,570
I didn't mean it.

1350
00:57:01,770 --> 00:57:03,690
Guys, this is very developed.

1351
00:57:03,910 --> 00:57:06,170
This is a very developed place.

1352
00:57:06,690 --> 00:57:08,150
They don't need a float.

1353
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:11,650
They don't need a float, guys.

1354
00:57:11,650 --> 00:57:12,510
Hahaha!

1355
00:57:13,070 --> 00:57:14,090
Oh, there we go.

1356
00:57:14,190 --> 00:57:15,970
Finally, I have an SMG.

1357
00:57:16,170 --> 00:57:17,070
Or LMG.

1358
00:57:17,310 --> 00:57:17,730
Hahaha!

1359
00:57:21,470 --> 00:57:23,130
Alright, we can get this.

1360
00:57:23,570 --> 00:57:24,830
Wheels are like...

1361
00:57:26,030 --> 00:57:26,510
Hovering?

1362
00:57:26,510 --> 00:57:29,450
Like, why would I need a hover when wheels are just faster?

1363
00:57:30,130 --> 00:57:31,150
Where do I go?

1364
00:57:32,410 --> 00:57:32,890
Like...

1365
00:57:33,530 --> 00:57:34,610
Where do I...

1366
00:57:36,990 --> 00:57:37,890
Alright, here we go.

1367
00:57:41,540 --> 00:57:43,280
Yeah, floating is so fun.

1368
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:43,980
I'm fucking stupid.

1369
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:44,780
Hahaha!

1370
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:49,060
What advantages does it actually give anyway?

1371
00:57:49,420 --> 00:57:49,640
Hahaha!

1372
00:57:51,020 --> 00:57:51,380
Hahaha!

1373
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:54,760
What about this?

1374
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:55,440
Grub.

1375
00:57:55,660 --> 00:57:58,300
Oh, that's why there's vending machines everywhere!

1376
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:00,540
Big grub!

1377
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:02,560
Alright.

1378
00:58:04,020 --> 00:58:05,460
Let's see...

1379
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:07,280
Oh my god.

1380
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:08,640
My inventory is a fucking mess.

1381
00:58:08,820 --> 00:58:11,360
Because I'm so overwhelmed on like...

1382
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:13,280
I mean, look at all these public transports!

1383
00:58:13,300 --> 00:58:14,680
Where are the civilians though?

1384
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:15,480
Like...

1385
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:20,500
Floating is so overrated.

1386
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:21,020
Exactly.

1387
00:58:21,340 --> 00:58:22,560
It really is.

1388
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:24,880
Alright, we have like...

1389
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:27,380
I feel like Evo Shield definitely takes a little bit harder to...

1390
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:31,260
Everybody is alive, yet there's nobody!

1391
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:32,320
Like...

1392
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:35,480
Where is anybody in this world?

1393
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:39,520
How is everybody alive, but we've only found two teams?

1394
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:42,480
The Prowlers?

1395
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:44,680
What the fuck?

1396
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:47,400
There's a lot of set dressing.

1397
00:58:47,540 --> 00:58:48,560
Not gonna lie though!

1398
00:58:49,780 --> 00:58:51,100
I think this...

1399
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:51,700
Alright.

1400
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,900
If... and somebody has like a...

1401
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:56,620
I wanna know for those who have like less...

1402
00:58:56,620 --> 00:58:57,240
Um...

1403
00:58:57,240 --> 00:58:59,300
Less like bulky PCs...

1404
00:59:00,380 --> 00:59:00,980
Um...

1405
00:59:00,980 --> 00:59:03,400
How it does with your PC.

1406
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:04,700
Because I...

1407
00:59:05,300 --> 00:59:08,960
This feels like this will eat up a lot of...

1408
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:12,120
This feels like it eats up a lot.

1409
00:59:12,220 --> 00:59:12,560
Hahaha!

1410
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:13,280
This feels like it eats up a lot.

1411
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:13,660
Hahaha!

1412
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:15,020
Of resources.

1413
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:16,020
Not gonna lie.

1414
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:19,500
It's fine for you?

1415
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:20,080
Okay.

1416
00:59:20,540 --> 00:59:21,260
That's good!

1417
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:21,840
That's good!

1418
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:25,780
Because it feels like there's a lot going on when it comes to like...

1419
00:59:25,780 --> 00:59:27,300
Stuff around the world.

1420
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:31,300
There's a lot of stuff.

1421
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:32,800
There's like flowers too!

1422
00:59:33,540 --> 00:59:35,080
There's an emergency alert!

1423
00:59:35,340 --> 00:59:36,360
This is not a drill!

1424
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:37,760
Lore!

1425
00:59:38,420 --> 00:59:40,600
No one really cares about the lore in this game though.

1426
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:41,280
Not gonna lie.

1427
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:42,020
Monkey man?

1428
00:59:42,220 --> 00:59:42,460
No.

1429
00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:44,500
We must kill monkey man.

1430
00:59:45,860 --> 00:59:47,100
I can at least...

1431
00:59:47,100 --> 00:59:49,420
Yeah I feel like... even I'm experiencing...

1432
00:59:49,420 --> 00:59:49,740
Like...

1433
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:53,440
I don't know if it's noticeable for you guys...

1434
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:56,180
But like even I feel a little bit like...

1435
00:59:56,180 --> 00:59:57,840
Some small frame drops...

1436
00:59:57,840 --> 00:59:59,660
When I look at certain places.

1437
00:59:59,980 --> 01:00:00,380
Hahaha!

1438
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:02,520
Hahaha!

1439
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:07,940
I could feel like a little bit of frame dropping.

1440
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:09,760
I don't know if it's noticeable to you guys.

1441
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:10,800
Hahaha!

1442
01:00:11,060 --> 01:00:11,660
Hahaha!

1443
01:00:13,300 --> 01:00:15,600
But like some areas I look at and I'm like...

1444
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:16,020
Wooohooo!

1445
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:19,260
I see...

1446
01:00:19,260 --> 01:00:19,460
Yeah!

1447
01:00:19,620 --> 01:00:21,520
I can see it on my frame count!

1448
01:00:23,100 --> 01:00:23,540
Oh!

1449
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:24,920
Oh!

1450
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:25,860
There's people here.

1451
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:26,940
There's people here.

1452
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:28,720
Where do we fight?

1453
01:00:28,780 --> 01:00:30,340
I guess we could fight the people next to us.

1454
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:33,480
I think it's frame stu...

1455
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:33,640
Yeah!

1456
01:00:33,740 --> 01:00:33,960
Yeah!

1457
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:34,180
Yeah!

1458
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:35,900
There's like a slight frame stutter.

1459
01:00:36,340 --> 01:00:37,480
Just a small one.

1460
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:38,720
It is very annoying.

1461
01:00:38,980 --> 01:00:39,180
Wait!

1462
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:40,820
What if I...

1463
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:42,220
Uhhhh...

1464
01:00:42,220 --> 01:00:43,800
I do not need all these.

1465
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:46,580
Alright, I'm heating it up.

1466
01:00:50,060 --> 01:00:50,640
Let's go!

1467
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:53,220
Are you guys scared of pussies?

1468
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:54,400
I can't climb up.

1469
01:00:58,820 --> 01:01:00,220
There's like people here too.

1470
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:01,260
Oh!

1471
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:01,680
Okay.

1472
01:01:01,940 --> 01:01:04,060
I was trying to figure out how to get up here better.

1473
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:05,380
Alright!

1474
01:01:05,380 --> 01:01:06,080
Where are they?

1475
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:09,100
Where?

1476
01:01:14,620 --> 01:01:15,080
Hahaha!

1477
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:16,920
It's right in the fucking shield.

1478
01:01:19,340 --> 01:01:19,680
No!

1479
01:01:19,740 --> 01:01:21,040
He's literally one!

1480
01:01:21,340 --> 01:01:21,800
Wait!

1481
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:23,160
No, don't thirst me!

1482
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:24,000
No!

1483
01:01:24,540 --> 01:01:25,100
Guys!

1484
01:01:25,260 --> 01:01:25,680
Yes!

1485
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:28,680
Oh shit!

1486
01:01:29,100 --> 01:01:30,240
Wait, there's another squad.

1487
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:31,460
Oh no.

1488
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:34,220
Oh god.

1489
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:35,480
Oh god.

1490
01:01:35,540 --> 01:01:35,760
Okay.

1491
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:38,620
I was too...

1492
01:01:42,630 --> 01:01:43,190
Okay.

1493
01:01:43,610 --> 01:01:44,750
That's fucking right.

1494
01:01:47,750 --> 01:01:48,970
Wait, is that another squad?

1495
01:01:49,750 --> 01:01:50,310
Woo!

1496
01:01:53,490 --> 01:01:54,050
Woo!

1497
01:01:54,510 --> 01:01:54,710
Woo!

1498
01:01:57,690 --> 01:01:58,250
Oh!

1499
01:01:59,970 --> 01:02:00,990
Get over here!

1500
01:02:01,750 --> 01:02:02,310
Nice.

1501
01:02:02,370 --> 01:02:02,610
Okay.

1502
01:02:04,270 --> 01:02:04,830
Alright.

1503
01:02:04,830 --> 01:02:05,610
Let's see.

1504
01:02:05,870 --> 01:02:06,430
Nice.

1505
01:02:06,670 --> 01:02:06,970
Alright.

1506
01:02:07,030 --> 01:02:07,570
Don't worry!

1507
01:02:07,710 --> 01:02:08,930
Crypto, I got you bro!

1508
01:02:10,170 --> 01:02:10,730
Nice.

1509
01:02:11,010 --> 01:02:11,390
Alright.

1510
01:02:11,530 --> 01:02:11,990
We're fine.

1511
01:02:13,910 --> 01:02:16,010
I panicked a little cause...

1512
01:02:16,010 --> 01:02:16,930
Uh...

1513
01:02:16,930 --> 01:02:17,450
Whoa!

1514
01:02:17,950 --> 01:02:20,610
I panicked a little because like I...

1515
01:02:21,670 --> 01:02:22,830
I didn't know what I was doing.

1516
01:02:24,010 --> 01:02:25,130
It's been a while.

1517
01:02:25,290 --> 01:02:26,510
I've been playing Overwatch.

1518
01:02:29,030 --> 01:02:34,250
I've been playing Overwatch so I panicked a little bit.

1519
01:02:37,230 --> 01:02:37,710
No!

1520
01:02:37,870 --> 01:02:38,170
I forgot!

1521
01:02:38,310 --> 01:02:38,490
No!

1522
01:02:38,970 --> 01:02:39,890
Does it register?

1523
01:02:40,190 --> 01:02:41,390
Before I open it?

1524
01:02:45,150 --> 01:02:45,630
Alright.

1525
01:02:45,630 --> 01:02:46,830
We'll find out.

1526
01:02:46,910 --> 01:02:47,890
We'll find out.

1527
01:02:48,010 --> 01:02:49,390
Well, we gotta wait then.

1528
01:02:49,390 --> 01:02:50,650
We gotta wait!

1529
01:02:52,170 --> 01:02:52,730
Alright.

1530
01:02:53,050 --> 01:02:54,330
Hey, we have a package there.

1531
01:02:54,890 --> 01:02:56,110
I'm gonna look for it.

1532
01:02:56,730 --> 01:02:58,050
Nothing bad's gonna happen.

1533
01:03:00,010 --> 01:03:00,830
Oh no!

1534
01:03:00,930 --> 01:03:01,670
He's on the grid!

1535
01:03:01,850 --> 01:03:02,890
He's back on the grid!

1536
01:03:03,470 --> 01:03:04,410
Oh shit!

1537
01:03:04,670 --> 01:03:05,090
Goodbye.

1538
01:03:06,570 --> 01:03:08,330
I'm done playing with you.

1539
01:03:09,110 --> 01:03:11,350
I'm fucking done playing with you.

1540
01:03:13,230 --> 01:03:16,190
Okay, we need like an actual Thermite though.

1541
01:03:17,410 --> 01:03:18,250
Over here?

1542
01:03:19,650 --> 01:03:20,750
Oh, they're over there.

1543
01:03:22,230 --> 01:03:22,790
Alright.

1544
01:03:23,630 --> 01:03:24,230
Let's go.

1545
01:03:25,650 --> 01:03:26,490
Let's see.

1546
01:03:28,530 --> 01:03:29,090
Ugh!

1547
01:03:30,070 --> 01:03:30,630
Alright.

1548
01:03:30,770 --> 01:03:32,130
Wait, why did you EMP so far?

1549
01:03:32,290 --> 01:03:33,390
I can't reach that!

1550
01:03:34,910 --> 01:03:36,530
What's the red thing though?

1551
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:42,000
Woah!

1552
01:03:43,620 --> 01:03:44,180
Alright.

1553
01:03:44,740 --> 01:03:45,520
We're fine.

1554
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:46,680
Everything is fine.

1555
01:03:49,460 --> 01:03:51,020
I wish I have...

1556
01:03:51,020 --> 01:03:53,140
I do wish I have...

1557
01:03:53,140 --> 01:03:53,620
Uh...

1558
01:03:55,900 --> 01:03:58,960
I wish I do have like a Thermite though.

1559
01:03:59,140 --> 01:03:59,460
Wait!

1560
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:00,700
That could've been my Thermite!

1561
01:04:01,740 --> 01:04:03,280
I'm like, I'm gonna look over there.

1562
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:05,480
Oh my gosh, I didn't even realize.

1563
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:06,200
Oh!

1564
01:04:06,660 --> 01:04:07,720
From where though?

1565
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,960
Joke's on you, I was just about to bat.

1566
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:12,360
Oh no, he's off the grid.

1567
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:13,500
So I don't know where he is.

1568
01:04:14,360 --> 01:04:15,460
He's off the grid!

1569
01:04:18,140 --> 01:04:18,660
Okay.

1570
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:20,600
I'm gonna ignore...

1571
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:22,920
I'm not gonna thirst him because of the fact that...

1572
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:24,400
Okay, he thirsted him.

1573
01:04:24,540 --> 01:04:25,680
Okay, so uh...

1574
01:04:27,100 --> 01:04:28,700
I need his loot though.

1575
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:30,880
I need like his...

1576
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:32,120
I need...

1577
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:34,300
I'd rather go with 3x.

1578
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:36,140
I feel more confident in 3x for this.

1579
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:38,680
Uhhhh...

1580
01:04:38,680 --> 01:04:39,520
Alright.

1581
01:04:39,740 --> 01:04:40,720
Any Thermites?

1582
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:41,900
Any Thermites in town?

1583
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:42,560
Nope.

1584
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:45,280
Okay.

1585
01:04:46,700 --> 01:04:48,180
Three other squads?

1586
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:49,140
Where though?

1587
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:51,480
Someone's off the grid though.

1588
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:54,400
There's caustic gases.

1589
01:04:54,620 --> 01:04:55,000
Woah!

1590
01:04:57,360 --> 01:04:58,300
That's right.

1591
01:04:58,580 --> 01:05:00,280
Get down from here.

1592
01:05:00,700 --> 01:05:01,700
Fucking idiot.

1593
01:05:07,420 --> 01:05:08,620
That's fucking right.

1594
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:10,380
Never shoot me again.

1595
01:05:13,980 --> 01:05:15,260
Three squads now.

1596
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:16,460
Why are they not in zone?

1597
01:05:18,860 --> 01:05:19,380
Where?

1598
01:05:22,300 --> 01:05:22,820
Woah!

1599
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:24,420
Sir, are you okay?

1600
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:27,380
Don't worry, I got you!

1601
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:30,460
I fucking got you!

1602
01:05:34,260 --> 01:05:35,240
Where are they?

1603
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:37,300
Get off the grid, Crypto!

1604
01:05:38,540 --> 01:05:39,640
Get off the grid!

1605
01:05:40,300 --> 01:05:41,660
They're gonna find you!

1606
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:43,280
You didn't burn your fingerprints off!

1607
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:45,320
Oh!

1608
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:46,920
Hear them.

1609
01:05:47,900 --> 01:05:50,060
I literally hear them right on top of me.

1610
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:51,640
Is that ours?

1611
01:05:51,940 --> 01:05:53,000
What the fuck?

1612
01:05:53,780 --> 01:05:55,740
Wait, there's a guy right here.

1613
01:05:57,320 --> 01:05:57,800
Sorry!

1614
01:05:58,160 --> 01:05:59,940
I should not have shot that guy.

1615
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,860
I was just like, what is he doing in there?

1616
01:06:05,940 --> 01:06:06,420
Alright.

1617
01:06:11,260 --> 01:06:13,040
Oh, they're falling off.

1618
01:06:13,100 --> 01:06:14,080
I hate it.

1619
01:06:18,540 --> 01:06:19,900
Oh shit!

1620
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:23,040
I fucked up!

1621
01:06:23,340 --> 01:06:25,680
I didn't realize they were up there.

1622
01:06:26,580 --> 01:06:27,260
Alright.

1623
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:28,580
This is dumb.

1624
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:30,920
Bro, this is fucking quick play!

1625
01:06:31,780 --> 01:06:32,920
I mean...

1626
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:33,900
Sorry.

1627
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:40,400
Mine is on full on Overwatch mode right now.

1628
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:41,600
Fucking hell.

1629
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:46,360
Alright, we're gonna put this in the...

1630
01:06:46,380 --> 01:06:46,800
I'm gonna put this up there.

1631
01:06:49,060 --> 01:06:50,020
Don't worry.

1632
01:06:50,100 --> 01:06:51,080
Everything is fine.

1633
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:53,280
Everything is fine.

1634
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:54,960
We have this cover.

1635
01:06:56,540 --> 01:06:57,280
Okay!

1636
01:06:57,500 --> 01:06:59,140
Everything is so fine.

1637
01:07:00,460 --> 01:07:01,200
Don't...

1638
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:03,840
I feel so safe here.

1639
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:05,740
Yippee!

1640
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:09,300
Please!

1641
01:07:10,090 --> 01:07:11,280
My god!

1642
01:07:12,140 --> 01:07:12,880
Chill!

1643
01:07:14,340 --> 01:07:16,080
I have it thrown in my...

1644
01:07:16,380 --> 01:07:17,320
I don't wanna use it yet.

1645
01:07:17,540 --> 01:07:20,700
Everybody is like...

1646
01:07:20,700 --> 01:07:22,760
Not chill right now!

1647
01:07:24,320 --> 01:07:25,040
Guys!

1648
01:07:25,180 --> 01:07:25,800
Please!

1649
01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:27,700
Chill a little bit!

1650
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:31,100
Just a tiny bit guys!

1651
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:32,800
Rink!

1652
01:07:32,980 --> 01:07:33,880
Rink reset!

1653
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:34,960
Come on guys!

1654
01:07:35,220 --> 01:07:36,260
Go play Rink!

1655
01:07:36,460 --> 01:07:37,220
Have fun!

1656
01:07:39,260 --> 01:07:41,280
Bro, they're all like on high ground?

1657
01:07:41,580 --> 01:07:43,020
Where the fuck is that?

1658
01:07:44,980 --> 01:07:45,980
Where is here?

1659
01:07:46,460 --> 01:07:47,020
Bro!

1660
01:07:47,100 --> 01:07:49,540
Bro, they're like doing corners and stuff too.

1661
01:07:49,960 --> 01:07:51,460
Where is that over there?

1662
01:07:51,640 --> 01:07:52,480
Where is this?

1663
01:07:53,140 --> 01:07:54,100
Oh my god!

1664
01:07:54,120 --> 01:07:55,200
I wanna know where that is.

1665
01:07:55,900 --> 01:07:56,880
On the map.

1666
01:07:58,120 --> 01:07:58,960
It doesn't...

1667
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:00,940
It literally doesn't tell you where that is.

1668
01:08:01,940 --> 01:08:02,500
Okay.

1669
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:04,640
Please!

1670
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:05,840
I just wanna know!

1671
01:08:08,420 --> 01:08:10,980
I wanna know exactly where that is!

1672
01:08:11,500 --> 01:08:11,940
I wanna know exactly where that is!

1673
01:08:11,980 --> 01:08:13,000
I wanna know exactly where that is!

1674
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:18,420
I don't wanna ping people!

1675
01:08:19,620 --> 01:08:20,380
I don't wanna ping people!

1676
01:08:20,380 --> 01:08:21,960
I just wanted to know where that is!

1677
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:23,520
Okay.

1678
01:08:23,980 --> 01:08:25,460
I'll charge it up now.

1679
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:27,700
Alright, here we go.

1680
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:32,760
Here we go.

1681
01:08:32,980 --> 01:08:33,020
Here we go.

1682
01:08:33,020 --> 01:08:34,660
I do something really stupid.

1683
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:37,040
If I climb here.

1684
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:38,160
If I climb here.

1685
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:41,620
To be fair, I can look up from here too.

1686
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:41,860
To be fair, I can look up from here too.

1687
01:08:43,020 --> 01:08:43,300
Really?

1688
01:08:44,060 --> 01:08:44,980
What the fuck?

1689
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:46,060
Oh no, I'm fucked up.

1690
01:08:46,180 --> 01:08:48,660
I didn't see... I didn't realize he was gonna go up there.

1691
01:08:49,260 --> 01:08:49,740
Alright.

1692
01:08:50,380 --> 01:08:51,660
This is fucked up, man.

1693
01:08:52,100 --> 01:08:54,220
This is actually so fucked up, guys.

1694
01:08:55,300 --> 01:08:57,040
This is actually...

1695
01:08:58,820 --> 01:09:00,440
This is so fucked up.

1696
01:09:00,460 --> 01:09:01,380
I revved too late.

1697
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:02,520
I revved too early.

1698
01:09:03,060 --> 01:09:03,720
Oh, nice!

1699
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:06,040
Okay, I definitely revved too early though.

1700
01:09:07,420 --> 01:09:09,000
He ulted too early too.

1701
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:12,360
Oh.

1702
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:19,000
Where?

1703
01:09:21,860 --> 01:09:22,380
Okay.

1704
01:09:22,720 --> 01:09:23,240
Okay.

1705
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:25,100
There.

1706
01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:26,020
There.

1707
01:09:32,420 --> 01:09:33,880
Oh my god, come on, ping me.

1708
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:34,800
That's fucking right.

1709
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:37,100
You have to heal now, bitch.

1710
01:09:41,420 --> 01:09:42,600
That's fucking right.

1711
01:09:42,820 --> 01:09:43,920
That's right, bitch!

1712
01:09:44,260 --> 01:09:45,340
I don't have third might anymore.

1713
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:47,560
I definitely third mighted too early.

1714
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:50,240
I definitely third mighted too early.

1715
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:52,280
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

1716
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:56,060
Bro, you're crazy.

1717
01:09:56,440 --> 01:09:56,920
Bro, you're crazy.

1718
01:09:56,920 --> 01:09:57,760
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

1719
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:02,520
Okay, this is bad for me.

1720
01:10:02,580 --> 01:10:02,780
Okay, this is bad for me.

1721
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:03,820
This is bad.

1722
01:10:05,140 --> 01:10:06,340
Alright, let's go in!

1723
01:10:06,700 --> 01:10:07,180
Oh.

1724
01:10:07,320 --> 01:10:09,160
That sucks for me, that's for sure.

1725
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:09,680
Oh, that sucks for me, that's for sure.

1726
01:10:18,230 --> 01:10:19,810
Bro, fuck you though!

1727
01:10:19,890 --> 01:10:20,130
Bro, fuck you though!

1728
01:10:20,130 --> 01:10:23,430
Fuck you for that bulls– For your high ground bullshit!

1729
01:10:24,330 --> 01:10:24,930
BITCH!

1730
01:10:29,590 --> 01:10:30,310
NOOOOOO!

1731
01:10:30,790 --> 01:10:33,190
YOU'RE STUPID HIGHGROUND!

1732
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:35,550
Am I alive?

1733
01:10:35,930 --> 01:10:37,330
That's a good question.

1734
01:10:40,010 --> 01:10:42,690
Fuck you and your high ground bullshit!

1735
01:10:47,110 --> 01:10:48,290
You know what?

1736
01:10:48,470 --> 01:10:49,770
I think I hate this meta.

1737
01:10:49,970 --> 01:10:50,870
I think...

1738
01:10:50,870 --> 01:10:51,990
I think...

1739
01:10:53,030 --> 01:10:54,310
You know what?

1740
01:10:54,990 --> 01:10:57,550
I think this meta is pretty fucking dumb.

1741
01:11:02,090 --> 01:11:04,330
I got fucking high ground.

1742
01:11:04,370 --> 01:11:05,470
It's so hard.

1743
01:11:05,890 --> 01:11:07,310
God damn it.

1744
01:11:07,930 --> 01:11:08,850
Let's see.

1745
01:11:09,130 --> 01:11:10,090
I'm gonna make sure...

1746
01:11:11,370 --> 01:11:12,730
Let's see...

1747
01:11:12,730 --> 01:11:14,970
Let's see if I can fix my...

1748
01:11:15,650 --> 01:11:17,930
What if I can fix my...

1749
01:11:17,930 --> 01:11:18,530
uh...

1750
01:11:18,530 --> 01:11:19,830
What's the word?

1751
01:11:20,870 --> 01:11:21,610
Am I okay?

1752
01:11:21,670 --> 01:11:22,410
I'm on 280.

1753
01:11:22,670 --> 01:11:24,550
I just wanna make sure I'm on 280 hertz.

1754
01:11:25,490 --> 01:11:25,970
God.

1755
01:11:26,170 --> 01:11:29,030
This map is taking so much of my fucking frames.

1756
01:11:31,790 --> 01:11:32,270
Alright.

1757
01:11:34,230 --> 01:11:34,710
Uhhhh...

1758
01:11:34,710 --> 01:11:36,530
That was the first game.

1759
01:11:36,750 --> 01:11:37,110
Yeah.

1760
01:11:37,690 --> 01:11:40,810
From that first game, I realized what the meta was gonna be.

1761
01:11:41,010 --> 01:11:41,410
Like...

1762
01:11:41,410 --> 01:11:42,230
I realized!

1763
01:11:45,670 --> 01:11:46,150
From...

1764
01:11:46,690 --> 01:11:48,590
From that first game alone...

1765
01:11:48,590 --> 01:11:51,890
It made me realize what this meta was gonna be like.

1766
01:11:52,450 --> 01:11:53,690
It made me realize what this meta was gonna be like.

1767
01:11:53,690 --> 01:11:53,790
...

1768
01:11:57,770 --> 01:11:58,270
Uh...

1769
01:11:59,530 --> 01:12:00,330
Let's see.

1770
01:12:00,850 --> 01:12:02,110
Trying to figure out...

1771
01:12:04,310 --> 01:12:04,810
Uh...

1772
01:12:04,810 --> 01:12:05,550
...

1773
01:12:06,230 --> 01:12:07,970
Trying to figure out what to play.

1774
01:12:08,390 --> 01:12:11,190
That fucking Caustic buff though is pretty nuts.

1775
01:12:11,570 --> 01:12:12,470
That fucking Caustic buff though is pretty nuts.

1776
01:12:12,470 --> 01:12:14,830
I guess we'll try Crypto and be off the grid.

1777
01:12:16,170 --> 01:12:18,130
I guess we'll try Crypto and be off the grid.

1778
01:12:18,130 --> 01:12:19,010
Thank you, thank you!

1779
01:12:19,250 --> 01:12:20,630
I really appreciate it.

1780
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:25,980
Alright, let me see my settings.

1781
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:30,800
Jesus Christ, is everything on low?

1782
01:12:31,020 --> 01:12:33,900
Okay, everything is on low, but Jesus Christ!

1783
01:12:35,080 --> 01:12:36,680
That shit was like...

1784
01:12:42,160 --> 01:12:43,280
This map...

1785
01:12:45,640 --> 01:12:46,620
It's like...

1786
01:12:47,540 --> 01:12:50,140
What map was it that used to cause this issue?

1787
01:12:50,460 --> 01:12:53,280
There was a specific map that used to do this before.

1788
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:54,520
Was it...

1789
01:12:55,180 --> 01:12:56,060
Was it Broken Moon?

1790
01:12:56,280 --> 01:12:57,880
No, I can't... It was Broken Moon!

1791
01:12:58,020 --> 01:12:58,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1792
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:01,400
This felt like Broken Moon on launch.

1793
01:13:01,620 --> 01:13:05,680
This felt... You know like, when Broken Moon first launched and it was like...

1794
01:13:06,380 --> 01:13:07,600
Was it Storm Point?

1795
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:09,360
Was it Storm Point?

1796
01:13:10,060 --> 01:13:11,160
Alright, but... What?

1797
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:12,320
Who the fuck said that?

1798
01:13:17,350 --> 01:13:19,830
It was a map on launch?

1799
01:13:25,740 --> 01:13:26,220
Fucking...

1800
01:13:27,080 --> 01:13:29,280
I will... I will... I will...

1801
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:29,880
Fuck.

1802
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:34,180
Yeah.

1803
01:13:35,220 --> 01:13:36,120
Just a fan.

1804
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:43,630
I thought that was like... Who the fuck...

1805
01:13:43,630 --> 01:13:46,670
Who the fuck said that?

1806
01:13:47,110 --> 01:13:49,930
Oh my god!

1807
01:13:50,110 --> 01:13:52,890
This... This is how little I played Crypto.

1808
01:13:52,930 --> 01:13:54,630
I literally have...

1809
01:13:55,430 --> 01:13:56,230
What the...

1810
01:13:56,230 --> 01:13:56,670
What the fuck?

1811
01:13:57,050 --> 01:13:58,250
What the fuck?

1812
01:13:58,250 --> 01:13:59,010
What the fuck?

1813
01:13:59,890 --> 01:14:01,250
What the fuck?

1814
01:14:01,410 --> 01:14:01,710
What the fuck?

1815
01:14:01,710 --> 01:14:02,470
What is going on?

1816
01:14:04,090 --> 01:14:05,170
Oh my god.

1817
01:14:05,750 --> 01:14:06,790
Um... Fuck!

1818
01:14:06,890 --> 01:14:07,850
I lost my train of thought!

1819
01:14:08,190 --> 01:14:10,010
I lost my train of thought!

1820
01:14:14,430 --> 01:14:16,210
Check the Twitch?

1821
01:14:16,650 --> 01:14:19,250
Bro, that's a fake fucking fan right there.

1822
01:14:19,310 --> 01:14:21,270
I checked the Twitch, bro!

1823
01:14:22,010 --> 01:14:23,370
Oh my god!

1824
01:14:23,450 --> 01:14:24,810
Wait, that's the real one!

1825
01:14:25,230 --> 01:14:26,610
I won't let you down!

1826
01:14:26,890 --> 01:14:28,250
I won't let you down!

1827
01:14:29,230 --> 01:14:29,810
Bro...

1828
01:14:29,810 --> 01:14:30,050
Bro...

1829
01:14:30,050 --> 01:14:31,470
I think he's gonna let me down.

1830
01:14:31,590 --> 01:14:32,450
That's what they all say.

1831
01:14:32,810 --> 01:14:34,370
That's what they all fucking say.

1832
01:14:35,330 --> 01:14:35,770
Hehehehehehe.

1833
01:14:36,490 --> 01:14:36,930
Alright.

1834
01:14:37,230 --> 01:14:41,750
No, this feels like one of those map... This doesn't feel as optimized as I like.

1835
01:14:42,790 --> 01:14:44,050
Because... Oh my god.

1836
01:14:44,130 --> 01:14:46,030
I get like, frame stutters a little.

1837
01:14:46,350 --> 01:14:48,990
I might have to lower my frames or something.

1838
01:14:50,190 --> 01:14:51,370
This shit, it sucks.

1839
01:14:52,970 --> 01:14:53,950
Oh, I hear them.

1840
01:14:54,010 --> 01:14:54,250
Whoa!

1841
01:14:54,370 --> 01:14:55,530
I hear them above me!

1842
01:14:55,930 --> 01:14:56,370
Whoa!

1843
01:14:57,250 --> 01:14:58,530
This might be where I die.

1844
01:14:59,070 --> 01:14:59,510
Hehehehe.

1845
01:15:01,090 --> 01:15:01,450
Oh.

1846
01:15:03,730 --> 01:15:04,090
Oh.

1847
01:15:04,170 --> 01:15:04,230
Oh.

1848
01:15:04,230 --> 01:15:04,990
This might be where I die.

1849
01:15:05,190 --> 01:15:06,030
Oh, it's okay.

1850
01:15:06,070 --> 01:15:07,550
He's more scared of me than I am.

1851
01:15:08,030 --> 01:15:08,390
Hahahaha!

1852
01:15:10,570 --> 01:15:11,150
That's good.

1853
01:15:11,430 --> 01:15:11,970
That's good.

1854
01:15:12,010 --> 01:15:14,250
He's scared of me because I was like, oh, I whiffed.

1855
01:15:14,470 --> 01:15:14,830
Hahaha!

1856
01:15:16,430 --> 01:15:16,910
I'm glad.

1857
01:15:18,810 --> 01:15:19,450
Thank god.

1858
01:15:19,650 --> 01:15:21,950
I love it when they're scared and I'm like, ooh.

1859
01:15:22,270 --> 01:15:22,630
Ooh!

1860
01:15:22,870 --> 01:15:23,090
Oh!

1861
01:15:24,070 --> 01:15:25,370
That frame stutter!

1862
01:15:25,510 --> 01:15:25,830
Whoa!

1863
01:15:26,910 --> 01:15:28,270
Ah, it was frame stuttering!

1864
01:15:28,330 --> 01:15:28,930
It's not fair!

1865
01:15:31,410 --> 01:15:32,410
It's not fair!

1866
01:15:32,450 --> 01:15:33,430
I was literally frame stuttering!

1867
01:15:36,550 --> 01:15:37,990
Where's the door?

1868
01:15:38,210 --> 01:15:39,170
Where's the stairs?

1869
01:15:40,510 --> 01:15:41,230
Where's the door?

1870
01:15:41,870 --> 01:15:42,490
Where's the stairs?

1871
01:15:42,490 --> 01:15:43,930
Where the fuck are the stairs?

1872
01:15:44,330 --> 01:15:44,450
Where the fuck are the stairs?

1873
01:15:46,750 --> 01:15:47,370
Okay.

1874
01:15:48,150 --> 01:15:49,370
What the fuck?

1875
01:15:50,190 --> 01:15:51,670
I'm like, so confused!

1876
01:15:53,930 --> 01:15:54,550
Oh!

1877
01:15:55,170 --> 01:15:55,790
Okay.

1878
01:15:56,010 --> 01:15:56,490
Woah.

1879
01:15:57,090 --> 01:15:57,710
Haha!

1880
01:15:57,710 --> 01:15:58,310
Okay.

1881
01:15:58,310 --> 01:15:59,330
Okay, well...

1882
01:16:01,950 --> 01:16:03,490
Okay, I'm alive.

1883
01:16:04,390 --> 01:16:05,390
Okay.

1884
01:16:10,250 --> 01:16:10,750
Alright.

1885
01:16:16,010 --> 01:16:17,010
Whoa!

1886
01:16:17,430 --> 01:16:19,790
It's okay, my teammates are coming back!

1887
01:16:20,390 --> 01:16:21,070
No!

1888
01:16:22,150 --> 01:16:23,150
No!

1889
01:16:26,790 --> 01:16:28,530
Who's this bitch?

1890
01:16:28,530 --> 01:16:29,130
No!

1891
01:16:29,670 --> 01:16:30,870
It's okay, my teammates.

1892
01:16:31,010 --> 01:16:32,210
Do they have guns when they come in?

1893
01:16:32,290 --> 01:16:32,670
They do!

1894
01:16:33,110 --> 01:16:33,690
It's alright.

1895
01:16:33,870 --> 01:16:36,370
As long as they live in 17 seconds...

1896
01:16:36,370 --> 01:16:37,030
I told you guys.

1897
01:16:37,370 --> 01:16:41,190
Anytime someone always goes like, I'll never let you down.

1898
01:16:41,390 --> 01:16:42,790
They always let me down.

1899
01:16:43,030 --> 01:16:45,690
You have to go in with very low expectations.

1900
01:16:52,870 --> 01:16:54,890
I knew that was gonna happen.

1901
01:16:56,350 --> 01:16:57,390
Alright, let's see.

1902
01:16:57,470 --> 01:16:58,510
I'm gonna land away from them.

1903
01:16:58,530 --> 01:17:00,650
So I can actually get stuff.

1904
01:17:03,550 --> 01:17:06,010
If they die, they'll just respawn anyway.

1905
01:17:06,310 --> 01:17:08,470
It's literally... there's no strikes.

1906
01:17:11,890 --> 01:17:14,210
Can't play without aim assist.

1907
01:17:14,410 --> 01:17:15,410
That's a good name!

1908
01:17:15,750 --> 01:17:16,870
Right there!

1909
01:17:17,890 --> 01:17:19,710
That is such a good name.

1910
01:17:19,850 --> 01:17:21,910
I can't find a second Mozamm.

1911
01:17:23,110 --> 01:17:23,790
At all.

1912
01:17:26,170 --> 01:17:27,330
Alright, they'll be fine.

1913
01:17:27,490 --> 01:17:28,270
I'm just gonna loot.

1914
01:17:30,770 --> 01:17:31,590
They'll be fine.

1915
01:17:31,990 --> 01:17:34,010
I believe in my team!

1916
01:17:34,530 --> 01:17:35,170
I believe in my team!

1917
01:17:35,290 --> 01:17:36,710
He literally said like...

1918
01:17:36,710 --> 01:17:38,290
He won't let me down, right?

1919
01:17:39,410 --> 01:17:40,390
I believe in him.

1920
01:17:40,470 --> 01:17:41,630
Maybe I should try the Spitfire.

1921
01:17:41,850 --> 01:17:44,510
I wanna try the Spitfire.

1922
01:17:45,930 --> 01:17:46,410
Oh!

1923
01:17:46,670 --> 01:17:47,430
There's a Rev.

1924
01:17:50,750 --> 01:17:51,230
Whoa!

1925
01:17:55,070 --> 01:17:55,550
Whoa!

1926
01:17:57,230 --> 01:17:58,510
Two squads near by?

1927
01:18:01,630 --> 01:18:03,130
Guys, I don't have...

1928
01:18:03,130 --> 01:18:04,230
How did she get purple?

1929
01:18:06,630 --> 01:18:07,730
What did she...

1930
01:18:08,490 --> 01:18:09,710
What the fuck?

1931
01:18:09,790 --> 01:18:10,150
Okay.

1932
01:18:10,370 --> 01:18:11,690
Wait, he came back?

1933
01:18:12,810 --> 01:18:13,410
Oh!

1934
01:18:13,530 --> 01:18:14,450
Cause he got...

1935
01:18:14,450 --> 01:18:15,770
It's the fucking... I forgot.

1936
01:18:16,330 --> 01:18:17,930
The respawn on...

1937
01:18:17,930 --> 01:18:21,410
I swear... Okay, thank god he wasn't the asshole that did the finisher.

1938
01:18:22,950 --> 01:18:24,030
It's okay!

1939
01:18:24,570 --> 01:18:25,850
14 more seconds!

1940
01:18:26,270 --> 01:18:26,870
Live!

1941
01:18:26,870 --> 01:18:27,330
Live!

1942
01:18:30,470 --> 01:18:31,950
14 more seconds!

1943
01:18:33,830 --> 01:18:34,690
Oh my god.

1944
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:35,430
There's so many people.

1945
01:18:35,810 --> 01:18:37,330
But when does it end?

1946
01:18:37,870 --> 01:18:39,750
What zone does it end?

1947
01:18:40,390 --> 01:18:41,390
It's Zonio.

1948
01:18:43,250 --> 01:18:43,930
Yay!

1949
01:18:44,870 --> 01:18:45,890
We're back!

1950
01:18:46,750 --> 01:18:47,430
Yippee!

1951
01:18:49,430 --> 01:18:51,130
33 seconds now!

1952
01:18:52,030 --> 01:18:52,970
It's okay!

1953
01:18:53,070 --> 01:18:53,850
We're back!

1954
01:18:54,690 --> 01:18:55,370
Yippee!

1955
01:18:56,870 --> 01:18:57,170
Hahaha!

1956
01:18:57,630 --> 01:18:58,950
Round 3!

1957
01:18:59,050 --> 01:19:02,290
I will never be able to use my...

1958
01:19:02,590 --> 01:19:06,070
Or any of my abilities at this rate!

1959
01:19:07,030 --> 01:19:11,010
The only fun part about crypto are the upgrades!

1960
01:19:11,970 --> 01:19:12,210
The only fun part about crypto are the upgrades!

1961
01:19:12,210 --> 01:19:12,670
The only fun part about crypto are the upgrades!

1962
01:19:12,670 --> 01:19:13,430
The only fun part about crypto are the upgrades!

1963
01:19:14,870 --> 01:19:16,070
I'm scared!

1964
01:19:18,430 --> 01:19:19,150
Okay.

1965
01:19:19,390 --> 01:19:20,250
All right.

1966
01:19:21,790 --> 01:19:24,150
I have one squad, but where?

1967
01:19:24,530 --> 01:19:26,570
I have one squad, but where?

1968
01:19:27,770 --> 01:19:29,330
Oh, there.

1969
01:19:30,290 --> 01:19:31,650
Oh, the range is shorter.

1970
01:19:31,850 --> 01:19:32,790
Wait, is the range shorter?

1971
01:19:33,030 --> 01:19:34,030
It's like over here somewhere.

1972
01:19:34,910 --> 01:19:35,810
Where are they?

1973
01:19:36,950 --> 01:19:40,230
I'll never be able to fucking... Oh, they're over there.

1974
01:19:40,590 --> 01:19:46,710
I'll never be able to get an upgrade or use my ult at this rate.

1975
01:19:46,810 --> 01:19:48,110
Like, I don't know.

1976
01:19:49,530 --> 01:19:51,690
I'm not off the grid yet!

1977
01:19:52,290 --> 01:19:57,350
They still have my... The government still has my information!

1978
01:20:02,160 --> 01:20:03,420
Oh my god.

1979
01:20:04,860 --> 01:20:06,640
I'm so close to a second Evo.

1980
01:20:06,780 --> 01:20:08,180
And then I can be off the grid.

1981
01:20:08,720 --> 01:20:10,240
We're almost there, guys.

1982
01:20:10,900 --> 01:20:12,480
I just need to hit 50.

1983
01:20:15,460 --> 01:20:16,700
Alright, this is it.

1984
01:20:17,720 --> 01:20:18,540
I'm gonna do it.

1985
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:19,140
Watch this.

1986
01:20:21,740 --> 01:20:22,300
Okay.

1987
01:20:27,140 --> 01:20:28,520
Guys, I'm lagging.

1988
01:20:32,260 --> 01:20:33,940
Oh shit, off the grid!

1989
01:20:35,420 --> 01:20:36,060
Let's go!

1990
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:40,700
I can do this!

1991
01:20:40,900 --> 01:20:42,100
I'm not being afraid!

1992
01:20:44,380 --> 01:20:45,200
Let's go!

1993
01:20:45,860 --> 01:20:47,240
Guys, please.

1994
01:20:47,560 --> 01:20:49,600
I'm off the grid, please, guys.

1995
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:52,780
Guys, please.

1996
01:20:52,840 --> 01:20:53,720
I'm off the grid.

1997
01:20:58,280 --> 01:20:58,920
Oh wait.

1998
01:20:59,000 --> 01:20:59,780
Oh, there's a Mirage?

1999
01:21:00,120 --> 01:21:01,760
Wait, did they buff Mirage or something?

2000
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:06,480
Where is it?

2001
01:21:06,540 --> 01:21:08,180
That's a Mirage clone, you idiots!

2002
01:21:11,320 --> 01:21:14,620
Guys, just give me... I need 78% and I can be off the grid again.

2003
01:21:16,060 --> 01:21:16,820
Oh no.

2004
01:21:16,980 --> 01:21:17,660
Oh no.

2005
01:21:18,220 --> 01:21:19,760
JK, off the grid!

2006
01:21:21,580 --> 01:21:22,600
They won't know.

2007
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:24,700
They won't know.

2008
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:26,180
They won't know.

2009
01:21:26,280 --> 01:21:27,540
Where could I be?

2010
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:32,240
They won't know.

2011
01:21:36,020 --> 01:21:37,000
I'm invisible!

2012
01:21:37,360 --> 01:21:38,720
How would they know?

2013
01:21:38,860 --> 01:21:40,200
How would they know?

2014
01:21:40,580 --> 01:21:43,480
How could they know?

2015
01:21:43,740 --> 01:21:44,840
They'll never know.

2016
01:21:45,820 --> 01:21:46,420
Exactly.

2017
01:21:46,520 --> 01:21:48,680
If I'm off the grid, they'll never know.

2018
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:51,480
If I'm off the grid, they'll never know.

2019
01:21:53,940 --> 01:21:54,420
Yeah!

2020
01:21:56,060 --> 01:21:58,620
Okay, I'm risking this just because I want to...

2021
01:22:03,370 --> 01:22:04,810
Oh my god, really?

2022
01:22:07,130 --> 01:22:07,850
Oh god.

2023
01:22:08,550 --> 01:22:09,410
They won't know.

2024
01:22:09,550 --> 01:22:10,590
Off the grid time!

2025
01:22:12,770 --> 01:22:13,730
How would they know?

2026
01:22:14,530 --> 01:22:15,650
How would they know?

2027
01:22:16,210 --> 01:22:16,690
How...

2028
01:22:20,010 --> 01:22:21,370
If I save, I get a chance!

2029
01:22:21,370 --> 01:22:23,090
How would they know?

2030
01:22:28,130 --> 01:22:29,890
Please don't shoot me.

2031
01:22:29,970 --> 01:22:30,570
Please.

2032
01:22:31,130 --> 01:22:32,530
Please don't shoot me.

2033
01:22:37,910 --> 01:22:39,090
They'll never know.

2034
01:22:39,370 --> 01:22:41,030
I really need a heal.

2035
01:22:41,270 --> 01:22:43,410
I really really need a heal.

2036
01:22:43,550 --> 01:22:47,150
But like this is not a good place to be right now.

2037
01:22:47,150 --> 01:22:48,190
It's not.

2038
01:22:48,590 --> 01:22:50,870
I don't feel safe.

2039
01:22:51,210 --> 01:22:51,930
I don't.

2040
01:22:51,990 --> 01:22:52,370
Oh shit.

2041
01:22:53,210 --> 01:22:54,110
Oh no.

2042
01:22:54,430 --> 01:22:56,630
Oh I don't have shields.

2043
01:22:56,790 --> 01:22:57,650
I don't have.

2044
01:22:57,870 --> 01:22:59,110
Oh ho ho.

2045
01:22:59,430 --> 01:23:00,670
Guys we gotta fly.

2046
01:23:01,510 --> 01:23:03,870
I can't get off the grid anymore guys.

2047
01:23:03,990 --> 01:23:04,790
We gotta leave.

2048
01:23:05,230 --> 01:23:05,970
Oh my god.

2049
01:23:05,990 --> 01:23:07,150
Shoot my buddy.

2050
01:23:07,430 --> 01:23:08,150
Shoot him.

2051
01:23:08,390 --> 01:23:09,250
It's pretty.

2052
01:23:09,610 --> 01:23:11,790
I'm not safe anymore guys.

2053
01:23:13,190 --> 01:23:15,810
I like how I can like stop fighting.

2054
01:23:16,090 --> 01:23:17,130
In the middle.

2055
01:23:17,150 --> 01:23:18,270
In the middle of the fight.

2056
01:23:18,470 --> 01:23:19,910
Just cause I'm off the grid.

2057
01:23:20,050 --> 01:23:21,590
That's so fucking dumb.

2058
01:23:21,850 --> 01:23:24,390
That's actually so dumb.

2059
01:23:24,850 --> 01:23:26,070
I literally...

2060
01:23:27,630 --> 01:23:32,530
I can just exist in the middle of the fight.

2061
01:23:34,050 --> 01:23:35,210
It's so stupid.

2062
01:23:35,490 --> 01:23:36,450
I love it.

2063
01:23:36,570 --> 01:23:37,610
I actually love it.

2064
01:23:40,250 --> 01:23:42,150
You just disappeared.

2065
01:23:42,530 --> 01:23:44,550
They can't kill me if I'm invisible.

2066
01:23:44,550 --> 01:23:44,730
It's impossible.

2067
01:23:46,210 --> 01:23:47,090
This is great.

2068
01:23:47,450 --> 01:23:49,030
I think I actually like crypto.

2069
01:23:49,210 --> 01:23:51,050
Just cause it's so fucking stupid.

2070
01:23:51,750 --> 01:23:53,450
Gamers don't look up exactly.

2071
01:23:53,990 --> 01:23:55,330
Gamers don't look up.

2072
01:23:57,010 --> 01:23:58,210
Oh I hear fights here.

2073
01:23:58,590 --> 01:23:59,850
I hear a fight over there.

2074
01:24:00,470 --> 01:24:02,390
What do I do for the second upgrade?

2075
01:24:02,730 --> 01:24:06,450
I guess I'll do... I guess I can... Oh the speed so my drone can live longer.

2076
01:24:06,750 --> 01:24:07,790
That makes sense.

2077
01:24:08,210 --> 01:24:09,690
There's like people over there.

2078
01:24:10,270 --> 01:24:13,110
I have zero attachments throughout this entire fight.

2079
01:24:13,110 --> 01:24:13,370
But...

2080
01:24:13,370 --> 01:24:14,010
Woooo!

2081
01:24:15,290 --> 01:24:16,010
It's time.

2082
01:24:19,330 --> 01:24:20,250
They won't know.

2083
01:24:24,900 --> 01:24:26,240
They won't know!

2084
01:24:27,880 --> 01:24:29,060
How would they know?

2085
01:24:29,680 --> 01:24:31,040
How would they know?

2086
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:33,760
Throw it out.

2087
01:24:34,360 --> 01:24:35,460
How would they know?

2088
01:24:36,180 --> 01:24:37,380
I'm literally so safe.

2089
01:24:38,240 --> 01:24:41,600
Okay I'm gonna wait until... I'm gonna wait until like...

2090
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:43,580
Does it look up?

2091
01:24:43,580 --> 01:24:45,360
It doesn't look up.

2092
01:24:45,800 --> 01:24:47,140
No no no.

2093
01:24:47,660 --> 01:24:48,340
Nope.

2094
01:24:48,420 --> 01:24:49,180
It's fine.

2095
01:24:49,260 --> 01:24:49,740
We're fine.

2096
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:51,380
Everything is fine.

2097
01:24:51,580 --> 01:24:53,220
Everything is a-okay.

2098
01:24:55,400 --> 01:24:56,860
Everything is a-okay.

2099
01:24:59,640 --> 01:25:01,000
Hey guys.

2100
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:03,300
Just to fuck with people.

2101
01:25:03,640 --> 01:25:04,300
Weeow!

2102
01:25:04,720 --> 01:25:05,400
Goodbye.

2103
01:25:05,780 --> 01:25:06,220
Goodbye.

2104
01:25:06,660 --> 01:25:07,020
Oh.

2105
01:25:07,180 --> 01:25:07,660
Hahaha!

2106
01:25:10,540 --> 01:25:11,680
Goodbye guys.

2107
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:12,800
Is it safe?

2108
01:25:13,580 --> 01:25:13,940
Are we safe?

2109
01:25:14,160 --> 01:25:14,460
Okay.

2110
01:25:14,540 --> 01:25:15,080
We're safe.

2111
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:15,880
Alright.

2112
01:25:16,340 --> 01:25:17,480
My job here is done.

2113
01:25:18,240 --> 01:25:18,760
Hahaha!

2114
01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:22,540
But you didn't do anything.

2115
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:23,520
Exactly.

2116
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:24,520
Exactly.

2117
01:25:24,820 --> 01:25:25,340
Hahaha!

2118
01:25:26,180 --> 01:25:26,300
Hahaha!

2119
01:25:26,320 --> 01:25:26,800
Hahaha!

2120
01:25:27,700 --> 01:25:28,220
Hahaha!

2121
01:25:28,420 --> 01:25:28,940
Alright.

2122
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:29,880
Let's see.

2123
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:30,520
Woo!

2124
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:31,480
Nice.

2125
01:25:31,620 --> 01:25:32,440
I need that.

2126
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:33,060
I need this.

2127
01:25:33,480 --> 01:25:34,000
Alright.

2128
01:25:35,260 --> 01:25:35,960
Don't worry.

2129
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:37,500
Off the grid.

2130
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:38,720
Do not worry.

2131
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:39,780
Everything is fine.

2132
01:25:40,700 --> 01:25:42,120
Enemy landed close to me.

2133
01:25:42,180 --> 01:25:42,440
Enemy?

2134
01:25:42,440 --> 01:25:43,340
It landed where?

2135
01:25:44,560 --> 01:25:45,480
Where is it?

2136
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:45,980
No?

2137
01:25:46,440 --> 01:25:47,040
Oh there.

2138
01:25:47,240 --> 01:25:47,680
No.

2139
01:25:47,820 --> 01:25:48,200
No.

2140
01:25:48,260 --> 01:25:48,660
You can't.

2141
01:25:48,720 --> 01:25:49,680
Don't destroy it.

2142
01:25:50,540 --> 01:25:51,600
Don't destroy it.

2143
01:25:53,260 --> 01:25:53,880
Don't worry.

2144
01:25:55,400 --> 01:25:56,000
Don't worry.

2145
01:25:56,080 --> 01:25:56,560
We'll be fine.

2146
01:25:57,140 --> 01:25:58,040
Where am I?

2147
01:25:58,520 --> 01:25:58,960
Hahaha!

2148
01:25:59,640 --> 01:26:00,080
Hahaha!

2149
01:26:01,160 --> 01:26:02,040
Don't worry.

2150
01:26:02,320 --> 01:26:02,620
I...

2151
01:26:02,620 --> 01:26:03,400
Hahaha!

2152
01:26:05,380 --> 01:26:05,820
Wait.

2153
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:06,360
Where are they?

2154
01:26:06,540 --> 01:26:07,160
Oh there they are.

2155
01:26:07,460 --> 01:26:08,220
There they are.

2156
01:26:08,300 --> 01:26:08,680
They're over here.

2157
01:26:08,900 --> 01:26:09,720
Oh no no.

2158
01:26:09,740 --> 01:26:10,720
Don't shoot my drone.

2159
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:12,420
How else will I live?

2160
01:26:12,420 --> 01:26:13,660
Oh shit.

2161
01:26:13,800 --> 01:26:15,320
Guys we have to go.

2162
01:26:19,680 --> 01:26:21,280
Guys we have to go.

2163
01:26:21,480 --> 01:26:21,880
Hahaha.

2164
01:26:23,440 --> 01:26:23,740
Wooow.

2165
01:26:24,940 --> 01:26:25,540
Wooow.

2166
01:26:25,660 --> 01:26:26,400
No, no, no.

2167
01:26:26,900 --> 01:26:27,800
Off the grid.

2168
01:26:38,040 --> 01:26:39,080
Oh shit.

2169
01:26:39,180 --> 01:26:39,420
No.

2170
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:40,600
Hahahahah.

2171
01:26:42,460 --> 01:26:44,760
It almost worked though.

2172
01:26:44,980 --> 01:26:47,000
Guys it almost worked.

2173
01:26:49,220 --> 01:26:49,820
Hahahahaha.

2174
01:26:50,220 --> 01:26:51,280
Hey guys.

2175
01:26:51,360 --> 01:26:52,340
I said it almost worked.

2176
01:26:52,360 --> 01:26:53,560
That was so smart though!

2177
01:26:53,920 --> 01:26:55,780
That was so smart!

2178
01:26:56,200 --> 01:26:57,720
Oh my god!

2179
01:26:57,960 --> 01:26:59,360
That was so smart!

2180
01:26:59,700 --> 01:27:00,400
Okay!

2181
01:27:00,660 --> 01:27:03,420
That was the smartest shit I ever did!

2182
01:27:03,800 --> 01:27:07,620
So... I just didn't expect the second guy.

2183
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:10,500
The second guy came out of nowhere!

2184
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:11,760
I got my one!

2185
01:27:12,360 --> 01:27:12,800
I

2186
01:27:16,760 --> 01:27:21,860
told you!

2187
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:22,900
This is how it went!

2188
01:27:22,900 --> 01:27:23,660
Crypto is fun!

2189
01:27:23,660 --> 01:27:26,320
I should really choose Crypto!

2190
01:27:26,340 --> 01:27:28,900
I never... They never expect the second guy!

2191
01:27:29,300 --> 01:27:32,100
I've never expected the second guy!

2192
01:27:32,920 --> 01:27:34,980
I got the outplay though!

2193
01:27:35,080 --> 01:27:37,460
That fucking outplay was so good!

2194
01:27:41,180 --> 01:27:43,240
No, it's just the Gibby!

2195
01:27:43,320 --> 01:27:44,880
The goddamn Gibby!

2196
01:27:45,960 --> 01:27:47,140
I keep everything!

2197
01:27:47,360 --> 01:27:49,620
This is like three strikes, but on steroids.

2198
01:27:52,240 --> 01:27:52,900
Okay.

2199
01:27:53,660 --> 01:27:54,220
Let's see.

2200
01:27:54,360 --> 01:27:55,860
Up high ground I go!

2201
01:27:57,380 --> 01:27:58,360
Don't worry guys!

2202
01:27:59,360 --> 01:28:00,580
They'll never know!

2203
01:28:01,640 --> 01:28:02,200
Shit!

2204
01:28:02,260 --> 01:28:02,860
Okay, sorry!

2205
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:03,840
They'll never know!

2206
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:06,680
Because I want to scan this!

2207
01:28:09,040 --> 01:28:09,600
Nice!

2208
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:10,480
Wow!

2209
01:28:11,500 --> 01:28:12,420
That's a lot!

2210
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:13,940
Holy shit!

2211
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:15,980
Okay, I'll get the speed.

2212
01:28:17,860 --> 01:28:18,880
They'll never know!

2213
01:28:19,260 --> 01:28:20,220
How would they know?

2214
01:28:21,160 --> 01:28:22,260
How would they know?

2215
01:28:23,020 --> 01:28:24,980
That's a lot of people, not gonna lie.

2216
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:27,160
Can I scan it again?

2217
01:28:27,340 --> 01:28:27,980
No, not again.

2218
01:28:30,620 --> 01:28:32,640
Alright, we're gonna put this here.

2219
01:28:33,360 --> 01:28:34,800
We're gonna put this guy here.

2220
01:28:35,240 --> 01:28:36,060
Off the grid.

2221
01:28:37,240 --> 01:28:37,680
Alright.

2222
01:28:41,260 --> 01:28:42,180
I'm gonna stay here.

2223
01:28:42,360 --> 01:28:44,900
I don't want to... I don't want to deal with...

2224
01:28:48,180 --> 01:28:48,620
Aww!

2225
01:28:49,840 --> 01:28:52,000
Doesn't help that I have like barely any attachments!

2226
01:28:53,720 --> 01:28:55,420
It does not help at all!

2227
01:28:55,560 --> 01:28:56,880
Wait, our guy needs help.

2228
01:28:57,560 --> 01:28:58,360
What the fuck?

2229
01:28:59,580 --> 01:29:00,660
Wait, that's a Gibby!

2230
01:29:01,020 --> 01:29:01,780
That fucker!

2231
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:04,480
That's the guy that did the finisher too, I'm pretty sure.

2232
01:29:04,980 --> 01:29:05,900
Oh, it's alright.

2233
01:29:07,200 --> 01:29:09,260
I'm safe here in my hidey hole.

2234
01:29:10,380 --> 01:29:11,240
Where is he?

2235
01:29:11,500 --> 01:29:11,940
Alright.

2236
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:12,780
Come on!

2237
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:13,700
Get out of that shield!

2238
01:29:15,960 --> 01:29:16,540
Come on!

2239
01:29:17,560 --> 01:29:18,580
Wait, where's his buddy?

2240
01:29:19,860 --> 01:29:21,020
Alright, we gotta go back up.

2241
01:29:22,260 --> 01:29:22,780
Alright.

2242
01:29:24,220 --> 01:29:26,400
I have zero attachments for anything.

2243
01:29:26,980 --> 01:29:27,500
Woah!

2244
01:29:28,440 --> 01:29:28,960
Woah!

2245
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:34,140
Consequences of my own actions.

2246
01:29:34,680 --> 01:29:39,240
If I look at a certain direction with like all that shit all over my screen...

2247
01:29:39,240 --> 01:29:40,240
I can't see it.

2248
01:29:40,380 --> 01:29:45,000
My frame drops by like fucking 60 or some shit.

2249
01:29:47,680 --> 01:29:48,200
Okay.

2250
01:29:48,280 --> 01:29:50,260
Oh no, wait, we have to go to the other side.

2251
01:29:50,260 --> 01:29:51,660
Wait, this is not good.

2252
01:29:52,360 --> 01:29:54,080
Wait a minute, we have to cross.

2253
01:29:55,520 --> 01:29:59,100
Wait a... guys, we're a little fucked here.

2254
01:30:00,180 --> 01:30:00,820
Um...

2255
01:30:01,740 --> 01:30:02,380
Um...

2256
01:30:04,140 --> 01:30:06,180
How do I get there?

2257
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:07,920
How do I...

2258
01:30:09,320 --> 01:30:11,180
How... how do I get there?

2259
01:30:13,980 --> 01:30:15,120
How do I...

2260
01:30:15,120 --> 01:30:16,380
Um...

2261
01:30:17,480 --> 01:30:18,120
Um...

2262
01:30:20,260 --> 01:30:20,480
Alright.

2263
01:30:20,680 --> 01:30:22,860
So that's them running now.

2264
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:25,560
They're running over here now.

2265
01:30:26,380 --> 01:30:30,340
Okay, we gotta figure out... I'm gonna hack this door.

2266
01:30:31,120 --> 01:30:34,660
Okay, and then... I open some doors.

2267
01:30:34,840 --> 01:30:35,980
Okay, I'm gonna be here.

2268
01:30:36,240 --> 01:30:37,180
They won't know.

2269
01:30:38,040 --> 01:30:39,060
They won't know.

2270
01:30:39,560 --> 01:30:40,620
How would they know?

2271
01:30:41,460 --> 01:30:44,240
Alright, they all rotated so we should be good now.

2272
01:30:47,100 --> 01:30:47,680
Nice.

2273
01:30:51,140 --> 01:30:52,640
Alright, alright, let's go, let's go.

2274
01:30:53,180 --> 01:30:54,740
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.

2275
01:30:57,140 --> 01:30:57,940
Alright, here we go.

2276
01:30:59,260 --> 01:31:00,680
Don't worry, I'm running in!

2277
01:31:01,960 --> 01:31:02,380
But

2278
01:31:07,020 --> 01:31:07,440
nothing!

2279
01:31:08,360 --> 01:31:09,720
Oh no, wait a minute.

2280
01:31:10,500 --> 01:31:11,340
Oh no.

2281
01:31:12,180 --> 01:31:12,600
Wait.

2282
01:31:13,220 --> 01:31:14,320
Why are they high ground?

2283
01:31:15,940 --> 01:31:16,660
It's not fair.

2284
01:31:17,820 --> 01:31:18,600
Oh no...

2285
01:31:19,200 --> 01:31:19,620
What?!

2286
01:31:19,620 --> 01:31:21,090
He shot from where?!

2287
01:31:21,940 --> 01:31:24,480
I knew I should've been off the grid.

2288
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:26,120
I should've never came back into the grid.

2289
01:31:26,280 --> 01:31:27,060
I should've...

2290
01:31:27,060 --> 01:31:28,880
I should've never...

2291
01:31:28,880 --> 01:31:30,380
I fucking knew it!

2292
01:31:30,440 --> 01:31:32,460
Never come back from the grid!

2293
01:31:33,360 --> 01:31:36,400
I'm sorry, we failed you!

2294
01:31:36,740 --> 01:31:38,720
Never come back from...

2295
01:31:38,720 --> 01:31:40,080
I fucking knew it!

2296
01:31:41,320 --> 01:31:43,880
I never listened to my teammates.

2297
01:31:44,280 --> 01:31:48,560
Never listen to your teammates and never come back from the grid.

2298
01:31:48,840 --> 01:31:49,440
That...

2299
01:31:49,440 --> 01:31:51,700
That's just...

2300
01:31:56,880 --> 01:31:59,920
I can't believe it.

2301
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:01,260
I'm like...

2302
01:32:01,260 --> 01:32:02,840
It's always high ground!

2303
01:32:03,740 --> 01:32:05,880
They said they got the line!

2304
01:32:10,480 --> 01:32:11,660
The grid...

2305
01:32:11,660 --> 01:32:16,320
The government has my social security number now!

2306
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:18,560
Look what they did!

2307
01:32:20,180 --> 01:32:21,920
What the fuck?

2308
01:32:24,600 --> 01:32:26,820
I can't believe it!

2309
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:28,560
I can't believe it!

2310
01:32:28,700 --> 01:32:34,560
From this game, I have learned to never trust any of my teammates ever again.

2311
01:32:35,020 --> 01:32:35,820
That's what...

2312
01:32:40,240 --> 01:32:42,680
From that game alone!

2313
01:32:46,180 --> 01:32:48,620
I have learned...

2314
01:32:49,480 --> 01:32:50,720
Teammates never...

2315
01:32:51,480 --> 01:32:54,180
Teammates do not matter to me.

2316
01:32:55,560 --> 01:32:56,320
Fuuup...

2317
01:32:58,380 --> 01:33:00,240
I think I like crypto.

2318
01:33:00,460 --> 01:33:01,160
Not gonna lie.

2319
01:33:02,120 --> 01:33:03,580
Crypto has been...

2320
01:33:04,480 --> 01:33:05,620
Really fun!

2321
01:33:05,740 --> 01:33:14,120
Crypto has been really fun so far.

2322
01:33:14,600 --> 01:33:16,360
I've been really enjoying it.

2323
01:33:19,700 --> 01:33:22,060
Time for number 3...

2324
01:33:24,520 --> 01:33:26,360
I think... I don't know what...

2325
01:33:26,360 --> 01:33:31,820
I think like... I don't know if crypto is gonna be good in an actual scenario.

2326
01:33:32,220 --> 01:33:33,320
Like if I'm not fucking around.

2327
01:33:33,700 --> 01:33:40,440
I feel like crypto might be like really really good if I wasn't fucking around a lot, but like I'm fucking around.

2328
01:33:40,860 --> 01:33:47,100
I'm fucking around.

2329
01:33:47,340 --> 01:33:50,800
I'm like fucking juking people with the invisibility.

2330
01:33:51,760 --> 01:33:56,760
I'm literally... I'm literally just going invisible in front of people.

2331
01:34:01,380 --> 01:34:03,420
That outplay was so good though.

2332
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:05,160
I just didn't expect the second guy.

2333
01:34:05,380 --> 01:34:09,920
If there was no second guy, that would have been such a good outplay.

2334
01:34:10,420 --> 01:34:12,340
Because I knew they were behind me.

2335
01:34:15,140 --> 01:34:17,560
Now you see me, now you don't.

2336
01:34:17,560 --> 01:34:19,680
Heh heh heh heh heh heh heh.

2337
01:34:21,300 --> 01:34:22,400
All right, give me a sec.

2338
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:23,060
I tabbed out.

2339
01:34:25,400 --> 01:34:26,420
All right, here we go.

2340
01:34:27,920 --> 01:34:29,960
The magician they call her.

2341
01:34:31,380 --> 01:34:32,260
Wee-oooh!

2342
01:34:33,380 --> 01:34:33,820
Oh!

2343
01:34:33,820 --> 01:34:35,060
Wait, that's sick.

2344
01:34:36,160 --> 01:34:37,600
I didn't realize I had that.

2345
01:34:37,700 --> 01:34:39,040
This is how little I play crypto.

2346
01:34:41,540 --> 01:34:43,000
Doki likes crypto now.

2347
01:34:43,060 --> 01:34:46,000
Next thing you're telling me she's making her own Doki coin.

2348
01:34:46,400 --> 01:34:46,840
Oh!

2349
01:34:46,840 --> 01:34:48,360
Duck, thank you for the super chat.

2350
01:34:48,480 --> 01:34:49,180
Thank you, thank you.

2351
01:34:51,340 --> 01:34:52,660
All right, let's see.

2352
01:34:56,040 --> 01:34:57,600
This... this has a lot of stuff.

2353
01:34:58,580 --> 01:35:03,940
The moment my frame starts dropping, I look at my surrounding and I'm like, yeah, that makes sense.

2354
01:35:05,280 --> 01:35:06,160
Yeah, this...

2355
01:35:07,300 --> 01:35:07,740
Yeah.

2356
01:35:11,180 --> 01:35:12,840
All right, let's see.

2357
01:35:15,500 --> 01:35:15,940
Oh!

2358
01:35:18,720 --> 01:35:20,260
My gosh, it's a market!

2359
01:35:20,780 --> 01:35:21,980
it's a food market!

2360
01:35:23,580 --> 01:35:24,020
Nice.

2361
01:35:25,780 --> 01:35:29,140
That's cute Yeah, there is a loss.

2362
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:34,560
I don't know if it's just me, or if anybody else is having the same issue right now.

2363
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:36,380
But it is a little annoying.

2364
01:35:36,760 --> 01:35:38,980
But like, you know... It's...

2365
01:35:38,980 --> 01:35:42,320
It was, like... It was either a broken moon or a storm point.

2366
01:35:42,540 --> 01:35:43,140
Oh, it was!

2367
01:35:43,220 --> 01:35:44,240
It was a storm point, yeah.

2368
01:35:44,460 --> 01:35:45,920
Storm point was like this on lost moon.

2369
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:46,380
And launch too.

2370
01:35:47,460 --> 01:35:48,320
I remember.

2371
01:35:48,760 --> 01:35:51,120
Storm Point was like this on launch.

2372
01:35:51,340 --> 01:35:52,280
It was Storm Point.

2373
01:35:52,520 --> 01:35:54,780
Where like, there was too much grass.

2374
01:35:55,220 --> 01:35:58,340
And the foliage was really pretty and everything.

2375
01:35:58,720 --> 01:36:02,640
But it was fucking killing my frames.

2376
01:36:04,120 --> 01:36:06,060
Yeah, but the drop is noticeable.

2377
01:36:06,820 --> 01:36:11,660
It's like, because I'm really used to a specific amount of frames.

2378
01:36:11,840 --> 01:36:12,960
I could lock it.

2379
01:36:13,100 --> 01:36:14,680
I'm gonna see if I can lock my frames.

2380
01:36:15,540 --> 01:36:18,120
I usually lock it at a specific amount.

2381
01:36:18,640 --> 01:36:21,520
But I don't know if it's... if I have it...

2382
01:36:21,520 --> 01:36:23,160
I don't remember what I used to lock it in.

2383
01:36:23,380 --> 01:36:25,200
I don't know if it is locked right now.

2384
01:36:25,320 --> 01:36:25,920
That's the thing.

2385
01:36:26,500 --> 01:36:27,720
I don't think it is.

2386
01:36:27,900 --> 01:36:28,860
It feels weird.

2387
01:36:32,940 --> 01:36:34,040
Alright, let's check.

2388
01:36:34,180 --> 01:36:35,620
Let's check if there's people here.

2389
01:36:36,540 --> 01:36:37,600
Yeah, it's not nice.

2390
01:36:37,820 --> 01:36:38,800
It definitely is not.

2391
01:36:40,900 --> 01:36:41,780
There is...

2392
01:36:41,780 --> 01:36:42,400
I don't remember.

2393
01:36:42,500 --> 01:36:44,600
There's like a specific frame you frame.

2394
01:36:44,600 --> 01:36:47,240
That you should lock for Apex.

2395
01:36:47,460 --> 01:36:49,680
But I'm not sure if I have it on this PC.

2396
01:36:50,940 --> 01:36:51,260
Alright.

2397
01:36:57,260 --> 01:37:01,170
I have a beefy PC though.

2398
01:37:02,570 --> 01:37:03,070
Alright.

2399
01:37:03,690 --> 01:37:04,510
Draft point.

2400
01:37:05,650 --> 01:37:06,750
There's like people there.

2401
01:37:08,830 --> 01:37:09,330
Nice.

2402
01:37:09,670 --> 01:37:10,450
Where am I?

2403
01:37:11,530 --> 01:37:12,810
I'm like, nice.

2404
01:37:12,950 --> 01:37:14,110
But also, where am I?

2405
01:37:15,130 --> 01:37:15,930
You got this.

2406
01:37:15,970 --> 01:37:16,290
I'm like, I'm like, I'm like.

2407
01:37:16,290 --> 01:37:16,730
Oh shit.

2408
01:37:16,910 --> 01:37:17,690
It's time.

2409
01:37:18,130 --> 01:37:19,330
It's fucking time.

2410
01:37:22,090 --> 01:37:22,950
Is it 240?

2411
01:37:23,310 --> 01:37:23,650
Am I?

2412
01:37:23,690 --> 01:37:24,990
I think I have it locked at...

2413
01:37:24,990 --> 01:37:25,650
No, I don't.

2414
01:37:25,670 --> 01:37:25,890
Okay.

2415
01:37:25,950 --> 01:37:28,250
I'm going to lock it 240 and see if it helps.

2416
01:37:30,850 --> 01:37:34,170
I know it was like, um, like a specific number.

2417
01:37:34,810 --> 01:37:37,310
Like, was it 249 or something?

2418
01:37:37,570 --> 01:37:38,470
I don't remember.

2419
01:37:39,010 --> 01:37:44,510
It's been a while since I looked at my frame lock on Steam.

2420
01:37:45,270 --> 01:37:45,950
I don't remember.

2421
01:37:45,950 --> 01:37:47,590
All right.

2422
01:37:47,610 --> 01:37:48,090
It's time.

2423
01:37:52,040 --> 01:37:53,220
Oh, I should recall it.

2424
01:37:54,140 --> 01:37:54,860
Re-calling.

2425
01:37:56,060 --> 01:37:56,600
All right.

2426
01:37:57,560 --> 01:37:58,380
Where are they?

2427
01:37:59,020 --> 01:37:59,760
Where are they?

2428
01:37:59,880 --> 01:38:00,840
I must fight.

2429
01:38:02,340 --> 01:38:05,020
I must fight, but also like, not really.

2430
01:38:09,900 --> 01:38:10,760
Oh, they used to be.

2431
01:38:10,820 --> 01:38:11,820
Oh yeah, 189.

2432
01:38:11,920 --> 01:38:12,260
Yeah.

2433
01:38:12,560 --> 01:38:13,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2434
01:38:13,400 --> 01:38:23,100
I remember because like, like, some of my pro friends, I don't know who, but one of my pro friends was like, yeah, you should lock at this because Apex can end up doing Apex can only run at this amount, so it doesn't matter.

2435
01:38:23,900 --> 01:38:24,720
Or something.

2436
01:38:25,440 --> 01:38:30,740
I remember, they were like, Apex can only run at this specific amount of frames, so you have to lock it.

2437
01:38:31,720 --> 01:38:34,940
Like, it doesn't matter if you lock it like...

2438
01:38:36,100 --> 01:38:42,480
If your PC monitor can handle big higher frames, Apex itself can only run this amount.

2439
01:38:44,860 --> 01:38:45,420
Sorry.

2440
01:38:45,660 --> 01:38:46,220
Goodbye.

2441
01:38:46,460 --> 01:38:47,420
Bloodhound, good luck.

2442
01:38:47,420 --> 01:38:49,640
Good luck.

2443
01:38:54,900 --> 01:38:58,000
Good luck, everybody.

2444
01:38:59,210 --> 01:39:00,320
I will help.

2445
01:39:00,440 --> 01:39:01,240
Now.

2446
01:39:06,920 --> 01:39:08,960
See, I contributed!

2447
01:39:15,350 --> 01:39:17,400
Says... says Wins.

2448
01:39:17,420 --> 01:39:17,800
I can make.

2449
01:39:21,040 --> 01:39:23,240
I helped, what do you mean?

2450
01:39:23,800 --> 01:39:24,840
Off the grid.

2451
01:39:25,480 --> 01:39:26,280
Don't worry.

2452
01:39:27,020 --> 01:39:29,540
I burned my Social Security card this time.

2453
01:39:29,820 --> 01:39:31,660
That was my mistake last time.

2454
01:39:31,980 --> 01:39:33,060
I thought I needed..

2455
01:39:33,060 --> 01:39:34,300
I thought I needed credit.

2456
01:39:34,720 --> 01:39:35,840
But who needs credit?

2457
01:39:39,800 --> 01:39:41,560
I don't need credit.

2458
01:39:42,460 --> 01:39:43,360
This time.

2459
01:39:44,540 --> 01:39:45,440
We'll be fine now.

2460
01:39:47,900 --> 01:39:50,520
What do you mean I'm doing so well?

2461
01:39:50,920 --> 01:39:52,620
I'm off the grid.

2462
01:39:52,840 --> 01:39:54,580
I don't know what else you want me to...

2463
01:39:54,580 --> 01:39:56,760
Say it's a crypto player that's on the grid.

2464
01:39:58,620 --> 01:40:01,620
All right, I'm gonna grab that purple light mag though.

2465
01:40:03,840 --> 01:40:04,340
Exactly!

2466
01:40:04,940 --> 01:40:07,440
Who needs credit when you have your crypto?

2467
01:40:10,480 --> 01:40:12,620
Besides, I did get that ult in.

2468
01:40:12,740 --> 01:40:13,820
That was a good ult.

2469
01:40:15,680 --> 01:40:17,820
Our guy hasn't even healed his shields yet.

2470
01:40:18,500 --> 01:40:20,060
Yeah, we should be able to...

2471
01:40:21,460 --> 01:40:23,840
Should be able to grab like uh...

2472
01:40:24,560 --> 01:40:25,940
The scan there.

2473
01:40:28,140 --> 01:40:29,840
The squad in this direction?

2474
01:40:30,420 --> 01:40:31,760
Definitely need shields.

2475
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:32,260
Whoa!

2476
01:40:34,780 --> 01:40:38,340
All right, I should use more of the new guns but like I'm not.

2477
01:40:39,660 --> 01:40:40,340
All right.

2478
01:40:42,160 --> 01:40:43,360
Oh wait, I forgot!

2479
01:40:43,360 --> 01:40:44,280
He's Bloodhound.

2480
01:40:44,400 --> 01:40:44,840
Whoa!

2481
01:40:45,100 --> 01:40:46,760
That's a lot of people fighting there.

2482
01:40:50,100 --> 01:40:51,320
That's a lot of people.

2483
01:40:51,640 --> 01:40:52,700
What are these green things?

2484
01:40:52,900 --> 01:40:54,120
Is it like potential end zones?

2485
01:40:55,460 --> 01:40:56,580
Or like teams?

2486
01:40:56,840 --> 01:40:57,980
Potential teams there.

2487
01:41:01,370 --> 01:41:02,730
All right, let's see.

2488
01:41:04,990 --> 01:41:05,490
Whoa!

2489
01:41:05,550 --> 01:41:06,490
Oh, it's so far.

2490
01:41:07,490 --> 01:41:08,770
There's two squads near us.

2491
01:41:08,790 --> 01:41:08,930
Oh!

2492
01:41:10,290 --> 01:41:11,050
There's a crypto!

2493
01:41:11,210 --> 01:41:11,710
Oh no!

2494
01:41:11,770 --> 01:41:12,730
He's gonna see me!

2495
01:41:13,070 --> 01:41:13,670
Get away!

2496
01:41:13,970 --> 01:41:14,190
No!

2497
01:41:14,390 --> 01:41:14,990
He's gonna see me!

2498
01:41:14,990 --> 01:41:16,110
He's gonna see me right there!

2499
01:41:16,690 --> 01:41:16,970
He's gonna...

2500
01:41:17,850 --> 01:41:21,490
No, I'm like... He's gonna see this one dot crypto right here!

2501
01:41:26,510 --> 01:41:27,510
That's fucking right.

2502
01:41:27,630 --> 01:41:28,010
Wee-oh!

2503
01:41:28,670 --> 01:41:29,750
That's fucking right.

2504
01:41:29,830 --> 01:41:31,250
Get better aim, bitch.

2505
01:41:32,070 --> 01:41:32,890
Don't look up.

2506
01:41:32,950 --> 01:41:33,650
Don't look up though.

2507
01:41:33,770 --> 01:41:34,930
Don't look up though.

2508
01:41:35,130 --> 01:41:36,110
Don't look up.

2509
01:41:36,650 --> 01:41:37,850
I need to be on the grid.

2510
01:41:38,030 --> 01:41:39,150
Don't... I need to be...

2511
01:41:40,190 --> 01:41:41,330
Don't look up, please!

2512
01:41:41,650 --> 01:41:42,690
Don't look up!

2513
01:41:43,350 --> 01:41:43,830
Don't look up!

2514
01:41:43,830 --> 01:41:44,310
Don't look up!

2515
01:41:44,490 --> 01:41:44,970
Don't look up!

2516
01:41:45,670 --> 01:41:46,570
Okay, there we go.

2517
01:41:48,150 --> 01:41:48,650
Okay.

2518
01:41:49,430 --> 01:41:50,810
I don't think they can shoot that.

2519
01:41:51,730 --> 01:41:53,810
I think I got it perfectly.

2520
01:41:56,390 --> 01:41:56,890
Okay.

2521
01:41:57,130 --> 01:41:57,930
This is it.

2522
01:41:58,830 --> 01:41:59,330
Whoa!

2523
01:41:59,750 --> 01:42:01,390
How did he know?!

2524
01:42:01,390 --> 01:42:02,230
Oh, shit!

2525
01:42:02,250 --> 01:42:03,130
Oh, shit!

2526
01:42:03,130 --> 01:42:03,930
Oh, shit!

2527
01:42:03,950 --> 01:42:04,990
How did he know?!

2528
01:42:04,990 --> 01:42:04,990
Oh!

2529
01:42:05,270 --> 01:42:06,830
How did he know?!

2530
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:11,300
Hehehe!

2531
01:42:11,660 --> 01:42:12,640
Can't go again!

2532
01:42:13,560 --> 01:42:14,960
He can't know I'm here.

2533
01:42:15,180 --> 01:42:16,460
He can't know I stayed there.

2534
01:42:20,240 --> 01:42:22,380
He can't know I stayed here?

2535
01:42:22,820 --> 01:42:23,880
Oh, shit!

2536
01:42:24,760 --> 01:42:25,820
Oh, fuck!

2537
01:42:25,820 --> 01:42:26,100
Okay.

2538
01:42:26,780 --> 01:42:27,340
Alright.

2539
01:42:27,600 --> 01:42:28,420
Sorry, team.

2540
01:42:28,760 --> 01:42:30,980
I'll stay alive because I'm...

2541
01:42:31,700 --> 01:42:32,800
Don't worry, team.

2542
01:42:33,160 --> 01:42:33,720
Hahaha!

2543
01:42:34,800 --> 01:42:35,620
Don't worry!

2544
01:42:36,360 --> 01:42:37,200
There we go!

2545
01:42:37,300 --> 01:42:38,400
I did my job!

2546
01:42:40,100 --> 01:42:41,040
I did my part.

2547
01:42:42,160 --> 01:42:43,320
I did my part.

2548
01:42:44,360 --> 01:42:47,240
Guys, I 100% did my part there.

2549
01:42:47,420 --> 01:42:49,340
Like, team, I did my part.

2550
01:42:49,340 --> 01:42:51,780
They got third-partied!

2551
01:42:52,740 --> 01:42:55,620
Guys, they literally got third-partied.

2552
01:42:55,740 --> 01:42:58,480
Like, what do you want from me?

2553
01:42:59,340 --> 01:43:02,560
They got third-partied!

2554
01:43:02,560 --> 01:43:04,160
There was nothing I could do!

2555
01:43:05,540 --> 01:43:06,260
Hahaha!

2556
01:43:07,160 --> 01:43:08,600
There's really nothing.

2557
01:43:08,980 --> 01:43:10,680
We could have all died.

2558
01:43:11,020 --> 01:43:14,960
But because I did my part, nobody died.

2559
01:43:15,300 --> 01:43:17,700
How do you get there?

2560
01:43:18,160 --> 01:43:18,880
Like...

2561
01:43:18,880 --> 01:43:19,300
How?

2562
01:43:19,900 --> 01:43:20,840
Oh, this way.

2563
01:43:21,060 --> 01:43:23,220
I might die from the lack of heals though.

2564
01:43:23,620 --> 01:43:24,980
I actually don't have heals.

2565
01:43:27,620 --> 01:43:28,360
Oh, no.

2566
01:43:28,940 --> 01:43:30,540
Don't tell me we all need health.

2567
01:43:31,400 --> 01:43:31,880
Hahaha!

2568
01:43:32,640 --> 01:43:34,100
Oh, I like that though.

2569
01:43:36,880 --> 01:43:37,360
No!

2570
01:43:37,360 --> 01:43:39,360
I'm gonna die from this!

2571
01:43:39,960 --> 01:43:40,440
No!

2572
01:43:40,580 --> 01:43:42,060
None of us has HP!

2573
01:43:43,660 --> 01:43:44,140
No!

2574
01:43:45,380 --> 01:43:45,860
Whoa!

2575
01:43:46,640 --> 01:43:47,640
Hey, guys.

2576
01:43:48,880 --> 01:43:49,680
We have a heal drone.

2577
01:43:51,180 --> 01:43:52,320
Oh, thank god.

2578
01:43:53,100 --> 01:43:54,200
Oh, thank god.

2579
01:43:54,520 --> 01:43:58,020
Oh, we live just a little longer.

2580
01:43:58,620 --> 01:44:02,000
Okay, I'm gonna put a redeploy on that side.

2581
01:44:04,500 --> 01:44:05,100
Okay.

2582
01:44:05,840 --> 01:44:07,340
I have a redeploy.

2583
01:44:07,720 --> 01:44:09,700
Am I the only one with a redeploy?

2584
01:44:09,860 --> 01:44:10,320
I am.

2585
01:44:10,480 --> 01:44:13,700
Alright, this is our only hope to live, guys.

2586
01:44:14,680 --> 01:44:15,280
Okay.

2587
01:44:16,960 --> 01:44:17,560
Uh...

2588
01:44:18,340 --> 01:44:19,020
Let's go.

2589
01:44:20,600 --> 01:44:21,480
Let's do this.

2590
01:44:22,220 --> 01:44:27,240
Okay, I don't know if I'm gonna live all the way, but like, it's the effort.

2591
01:44:29,420 --> 01:44:29,980
Meow!

2592
01:44:30,340 --> 01:44:30,900
Meow!

2593
01:44:32,400 --> 01:44:33,920
I'm gonna die in the air.

2594
01:44:34,080 --> 01:44:36,040
I'm 100% gonna die.

2595
01:44:36,140 --> 01:44:36,700
Unless...

2596
01:44:37,360 --> 01:44:37,640
Unless...

2597
01:44:37,640 --> 01:44:38,000
Oh!

2598
01:44:40,720 --> 01:44:41,280
Woo!

2599
01:44:43,300 --> 01:44:43,860
Okay.

2600
01:44:44,140 --> 01:44:44,860
Give me a sec.

2601
01:44:44,860 --> 01:44:46,020
Give me a sec.

2602
01:44:46,120 --> 01:44:49,340
Let me heal up first so I can feel a little safer.

2603
01:44:49,640 --> 01:44:50,200
I...

2604
01:44:50,740 --> 01:44:51,040
Alright.

2605
01:44:53,780 --> 01:44:54,380
Alright.

2606
01:44:57,080 --> 01:44:58,340
Oh, I hear people.

2607
01:44:59,820 --> 01:45:00,900
Oh, I hear people.

2608
01:45:03,260 --> 01:45:04,100
Oh, no.

2609
01:45:04,740 --> 01:45:05,880
Oh, no.

2610
01:45:06,580 --> 01:45:07,180
No.

2611
01:45:08,040 --> 01:45:08,900
Oh, no.

2612
01:45:08,900 --> 01:45:09,080
No.

2613
01:45:12,420 --> 01:45:13,960
No, he's on the grid!

2614
01:45:14,280 --> 01:45:14,720
No!

2615
01:45:20,500 --> 01:45:21,140
Oh, god.

2616
01:45:21,360 --> 01:45:22,040
Oh, god.

2617
01:45:22,460 --> 01:45:22,940
Please.

2618
01:45:23,580 --> 01:45:24,060
Please.

2619
01:45:30,700 --> 01:45:31,520
Oh, my god.

2620
01:45:31,560 --> 01:45:32,100
I have nothing.

2621
01:45:35,580 --> 01:45:36,280
Oh, no.

2622
01:45:36,700 --> 01:45:37,460
Oh, no.

2623
01:45:41,520 --> 01:45:42,440
There's over there.

2624
01:45:42,480 --> 01:45:43,020
They're over there.

2625
01:45:50,120 --> 01:45:50,600
No!

2626
01:45:51,280 --> 01:45:52,240
You bitch!

2627
01:45:53,300 --> 01:45:54,060
Please!

2628
01:45:54,060 --> 01:45:55,760
We have to go to zone!

2629
01:45:57,600 --> 01:45:58,360
No!

2630
01:45:59,300 --> 01:45:59,480
No!

2631
01:46:00,200 --> 01:46:00,800
My...

2632
01:46:01,300 --> 01:46:01,740
bitches!

2633
01:46:02,320 --> 01:46:03,460
Oh, god.

2634
01:46:03,540 --> 01:46:04,500
Oh, god.

2635
01:46:04,940 --> 01:46:05,740
Oh, god.

2636
01:46:05,760 --> 01:46:07,300
I can't live here.

2637
01:46:09,220 --> 01:46:09,980
Okay.

2638
01:46:09,980 --> 01:46:10,740
Okay.

2639
01:46:11,460 --> 01:46:12,220
No.

2640
01:46:13,020 --> 01:46:17,020
Lifeline, you just... Lifeline just has to live like seven seconds.

2641
01:46:17,440 --> 01:46:18,200
Two.

2642
01:46:18,980 --> 01:46:19,360
One.

2643
01:46:20,960 --> 01:46:21,720
Yes!

2644
01:46:21,720 --> 01:46:22,480
Lifeline!

2645
01:46:22,560 --> 01:46:23,160
Live forever!

2646
01:46:23,300 --> 01:46:23,800
Yes!

2647
01:46:25,460 --> 01:46:26,820
That's all I wanted.

2648
01:46:27,320 --> 01:46:28,800
We can die now.

2649
01:46:29,100 --> 01:46:30,880
We can die in peace.

2650
01:46:32,200 --> 01:46:34,740
The Lifeline lived for us.

2651
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:36,100
We can...

2652
01:46:36,980 --> 01:46:39,360
We can die in peace now.

2653
01:46:39,900 --> 01:46:44,340
I might as well be dead so I can regen my HP.

2654
01:46:44,880 --> 01:46:46,600
I might as well.

2655
01:46:46,620 --> 01:46:47,040
Okay.

2656
01:46:47,120 --> 01:46:49,040
But, like, what if...

2657
01:46:49,040 --> 01:46:50,060
Shit!

2658
01:46:51,740 --> 01:46:54,850
The grid!

2659
01:46:55,530 --> 01:46:58,230
I just... I just wanted to get off the grid!

2660
01:46:58,710 --> 01:46:59,690
Oh, no.

2661
01:46:59,930 --> 01:47:00,790
Oh, no.

2662
01:47:00,850 --> 01:47:02,210
It's up to me.

2663
01:47:02,490 --> 01:47:03,710
It's up to me.

2664
01:47:03,750 --> 01:47:04,670
Please, live three...

2665
01:47:05,450 --> 01:47:06,730
Two... One...

2666
01:47:07,530 --> 01:47:07,850
Zero...

2667
01:47:07,850 --> 01:47:10,270
Oh, my god!

2668
01:47:10,290 --> 01:47:11,370
I'm so close!

2669
01:47:11,750 --> 01:47:13,290
I'm so close!

2670
01:47:14,210 --> 01:47:15,690
Oh, my god!

2671
01:47:15,770 --> 01:47:20,050
We... We really needed one more second.

2672
01:47:20,610 --> 01:47:21,250
Bro!

2673
01:47:22,330 --> 01:47:22,970
Okay.

2674
01:47:24,730 --> 01:47:25,450
Alright.

2675
01:47:25,450 --> 01:47:25,930
Alright.

2676
01:47:28,690 --> 01:47:32,430
We have a little special guest joining us.

2677
01:47:32,730 --> 01:47:33,970
As per tradition.

2678
01:47:37,290 --> 01:47:40,190
I also need to cap my frames real fast.

2679
01:47:40,310 --> 01:47:40,770
Let me...

2680
01:47:40,770 --> 01:47:42,850
As per tradition.

2681
01:47:44,690 --> 01:47:45,970
Every season launch.

2682
01:47:46,270 --> 01:47:47,910
Except for one, sadly.

2683
01:47:48,050 --> 01:47:51,570
We always had one person that would join us.

2684
01:48:07,710 --> 01:48:24,070
And I'm not sure if it's a good thing or not.

2685
01:48:24,070 --> 01:48:25,290
But, I'm sure that So, we have a little And we have a little Oh, yeah.

2686
01:48:25,350 --> 01:48:26,010
Have you tried crypto?

2687
01:48:26,530 --> 01:48:27,970
That shit's... I'm a crypto man.

2688
01:48:28,010 --> 01:48:28,790
I enjoyed it.

2689
01:48:30,390 --> 01:48:32,110
I was playing him.

2690
01:48:32,250 --> 01:48:33,350
I was playing him.

2691
01:48:33,430 --> 01:48:34,210
I was going off the grid.

2692
01:48:36,870 --> 01:48:38,910
Though... His shit is very loud, though.

2693
01:48:39,090 --> 01:48:39,550
Is it?

2694
01:48:39,670 --> 01:48:40,910
I was not paying attention.

2695
01:48:41,530 --> 01:48:43,370
As long as your drone isn't near you.

2696
01:48:43,470 --> 01:48:45,650
As long as your drone is not near you, it's fine.

2697
01:48:46,570 --> 01:48:48,330
I feel like...

2698
01:48:48,330 --> 01:48:49,110
Oh, my god!

2699
01:48:49,110 --> 01:48:50,250
I didn't cap my frames.

2700
01:48:50,410 --> 01:48:51,750
That makes so much more sense now.

2701
01:48:51,750 --> 01:48:53,350
My launch options.

2702
01:48:53,930 --> 01:48:54,370
Yeah.

2703
01:48:55,810 --> 01:48:56,250
190?

2704
01:48:57,190 --> 01:48:58,890
No, there's like a specific...

2705
01:48:58,890 --> 01:49:00,330
I think they fixed it, though.

2706
01:49:00,370 --> 01:49:01,010
Launch options.

2707
01:49:01,030 --> 01:49:03,490
Guys, what's the launch options that you do for Apex?

2708
01:49:03,530 --> 01:49:03,970
Again?

2709
01:49:04,170 --> 01:49:04,770
I don't remember.

2710
01:49:05,890 --> 01:49:07,390
Because this PC doesn't have it.

2711
01:49:08,690 --> 01:49:10,850
Okay, I'm gonna up the engine a little bit.

2712
01:49:11,070 --> 01:49:13,770
Guys, what are the Apex launch options that you put?

2713
01:49:15,450 --> 01:49:15,890
Uh...

2714
01:49:16,610 --> 01:49:17,970
Guys, give me the like line.

2715
01:49:18,070 --> 01:49:18,850
The line code.

2716
01:49:19,010 --> 01:49:19,830
Not the frame number.

2717
01:49:19,930 --> 01:49:21,030
The line code.

2718
01:49:23,490 --> 01:49:24,730
The command line.

2719
01:49:24,970 --> 01:49:25,110
Command line.

2720
01:49:25,110 --> 01:49:25,810
Yeah, the command line.

2721
01:49:26,050 --> 01:49:27,530
I feel like there's more, is it?

2722
01:49:27,610 --> 01:49:30,170
Was it just the FPS or was it more stuff?

2723
01:49:30,350 --> 01:49:30,750
I don't remember.

2724
01:49:31,350 --> 01:49:31,710
Probably.

2725
01:49:32,370 --> 01:49:34,110
I'll do 240 for now.

2726
01:49:36,090 --> 01:49:37,370
Let's see if that works.

2727
01:49:38,530 --> 01:49:39,010
Alright.

2728
01:49:39,010 --> 01:49:39,690
Oh, my god.

2729
01:49:39,710 --> 01:49:40,650
That makes more sense now.

2730
01:49:40,770 --> 01:49:43,010
I did not have my frames capped.

2731
01:49:44,150 --> 01:49:45,630
Alright, let's see if this is better.

2732
01:49:46,610 --> 01:49:47,470
You do that?

2733
01:49:48,210 --> 01:49:48,690
Yeah.

2734
01:49:49,850 --> 01:49:50,330
Yeah.

2735
01:49:50,750 --> 01:49:51,590
That's... Honestly?

2736
01:49:51,750 --> 01:49:52,030
What?

2737
01:49:52,170 --> 01:49:52,770
You don't?

2738
01:49:52,910 --> 01:49:53,830
I don't.

2739
01:49:53,830 --> 01:49:54,590
You don't?

2740
01:49:54,590 --> 01:49:54,990
Should I?

2741
01:49:55,610 --> 01:49:55,870
Yeah.

2742
01:49:55,930 --> 01:49:58,130
I used to like limit it to 190.

2743
01:49:58,130 --> 01:49:59,170
Yeah, optimize your game more.

2744
01:49:59,250 --> 01:50:00,370
Like 190.

2745
01:50:01,850 --> 01:50:03,290
What do you mean?

2746
01:50:03,830 --> 01:50:05,350
Hold on, let me just...

2747
01:50:05,350 --> 01:50:07,250
Let's see this bullshit 3.

2748
01:50:07,810 --> 01:50:10,910
You have to do FPS max something something.

2749
01:50:11,110 --> 01:50:12,650
Oh, they have a new like respawn.

2750
01:50:12,950 --> 01:50:15,490
Like Apex Legends respawn thingy.

2751
01:50:15,950 --> 01:50:19,050
Guys, is Tengen better or should I up him more?

2752
01:50:24,060 --> 01:50:25,220
I like the new season.

2753
01:50:25,280 --> 01:50:26,420
I love crypto.

2754
01:50:28,080 --> 01:50:29,420
Crypto is so fun to play.

2755
01:50:29,620 --> 01:50:31,520
How do you enjoy crypto?

2756
01:50:31,660 --> 01:50:32,220
That's the thing.

2757
01:50:32,280 --> 01:50:32,780
Off the grid?

2758
01:50:33,500 --> 01:50:35,340
I don't see you as a crypto player.

2759
01:50:36,380 --> 01:50:38,140
I'm not doing it to like kill people.

2760
01:50:38,280 --> 01:50:39,200
I'm doing it to fuck around.

2761
01:50:39,540 --> 01:50:42,680
So I would knock somebody and then I go off the grid in front of them.

2762
01:50:46,260 --> 01:50:50,340
But with the off the grid, I feel like I can make some plays.

2763
01:50:50,440 --> 01:50:50,840
Yeah, yeah.

2764
01:50:50,840 --> 01:50:51,820
I run full corner and just...

2765
01:50:52,440 --> 01:50:53,420
pull up my drone and just...

2766
01:50:53,420 --> 01:50:54,180
I'm gone.

2767
01:50:54,200 --> 01:50:54,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2768
01:50:54,620 --> 01:50:59,260
The funniest one is that I was getting chased but the zone was also pushing in.

2769
01:50:59,520 --> 01:51:10,360
And then like I went off the grid while I was in the zone and a team was coming behind me and then they ran past me and then I came back in the grid and shot them in the back.

2770
01:51:10,500 --> 01:51:13,180
But then like I didn't see the second guy!

2771
01:51:13,500 --> 01:51:15,020
And then the second guy killed me.

2772
01:51:15,260 --> 01:51:17,700
I didn't see the second guy.

2773
01:51:17,900 --> 01:51:18,820
Alright, invite me.

2774
01:51:18,900 --> 01:51:19,820
I'll play on your server.

2775
01:51:21,080 --> 01:51:21,840
My server?

2776
01:51:21,960 --> 01:51:22,140
Okay.

2777
01:51:22,440 --> 01:51:23,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2778
01:51:24,660 --> 01:51:25,160
Alright.

2779
01:51:25,280 --> 01:51:25,780
Guys.

2780
01:51:25,980 --> 01:51:26,960
Who else should I play?

2781
01:51:27,180 --> 01:51:27,680
Guys.

2782
01:51:27,860 --> 01:51:29,020
With the new characters.

2783
01:51:29,320 --> 01:51:30,320
Are we playing rank?

2784
01:51:31,020 --> 01:51:32,660
No, we're not fucking playing rank.

2785
01:51:32,700 --> 01:51:34,760
We're gonna play Trios Revival.

2786
01:51:35,820 --> 01:51:36,820
Fucking Revival.

2787
01:51:39,500 --> 01:51:40,000
This...

2788
01:51:40,660 --> 01:51:43,140
This new map is kind of confusing me.

2789
01:51:43,140 --> 01:51:43,960
Like I swear.

2790
01:51:44,140 --> 01:51:45,320
I don't know.

2791
01:51:45,440 --> 01:51:49,460
Tempo is like go in the tree, go off the grid, win rank game.

2792
01:51:50,360 --> 01:51:51,160
We're not...

2793
01:51:51,160 --> 01:51:54,800
There's no trees in fucking Chalkway!

2794
01:51:55,080 --> 01:51:56,140
What do you mean?

2795
01:51:57,460 --> 01:51:58,480
It's buildings!

2796
01:51:58,700 --> 01:51:59,400
There's apartments!

2797
01:51:59,700 --> 01:52:00,200
It's Angel City.

2798
01:52:00,440 --> 01:52:01,840
It's Angel City.

2799
01:52:03,220 --> 01:52:03,860
What's up?

2800
01:52:03,940 --> 01:52:04,720
Tengen a bit more.

2801
01:52:05,640 --> 01:52:06,840
Is it better now?

2802
01:52:06,960 --> 01:52:08,640
I haven't seen any Vantage players.

2803
01:52:09,060 --> 01:52:13,540
Chat's telling me to play Vantage but I literally have not seen any Vantage players.

2804
01:52:13,660 --> 01:52:14,480
Did they change Vantage?

2805
01:52:14,700 --> 01:52:21,540
Yeah, they made it her second shot is more buff and you don't have to look at Echo anymore to go to places.

2806
01:52:21,800 --> 01:52:21,820
That's nice.

2807
01:52:22,260 --> 01:52:24,960
But I've not seen any Vantage players.

2808
01:52:25,320 --> 01:52:31,280
It's mostly Crypto and Watson that I see a lot.

2809
01:52:31,520 --> 01:52:33,340
To be fair, this is my fourth game today.

2810
01:52:33,980 --> 01:52:34,500
Right.

2811
01:52:34,600 --> 01:52:35,860
I've played like three already.

2812
01:52:37,040 --> 01:52:38,980
Alright, invite me whenever.

2813
01:52:39,280 --> 01:52:41,040
Don't touch any FPS and like...

2814
01:52:41,840 --> 01:52:42,360
Damn.

2815
01:52:43,100 --> 01:52:44,400
I've been playing Overwatch.

2816
01:52:44,860 --> 01:52:45,720
You have?

2817
01:52:46,020 --> 01:52:46,560
Oh shit.

2818
01:52:46,660 --> 01:52:48,100
I was in the firing range.

2819
01:52:48,180 --> 01:52:50,160
I thought it shows up when you're in the firing range.

2820
01:52:50,640 --> 01:52:51,360
Does it?

2821
01:52:51,640 --> 01:52:52,320
Oh, Rampart.

2822
01:52:52,380 --> 01:52:53,240
I still love Rampart.

2823
01:52:53,300 --> 01:52:53,540
Yeah.

2824
01:52:54,400 --> 01:52:55,060
I'm here.

2825
01:52:55,260 --> 01:52:56,360
I'm gonna play Rampart.

2826
01:52:56,440 --> 01:52:57,400
You can do Crypto.

2827
01:52:57,400 --> 01:52:58,180
I'll do Rampart.

2828
01:52:59,600 --> 01:53:00,080
Sure.

2829
01:53:00,520 --> 01:53:01,220
The fuck?

2830
01:53:01,540 --> 01:53:02,500
I can't change.

2831
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:03,800
Oh my god.

2832
01:53:03,840 --> 01:53:05,100
I love launch day bugs.

2833
01:53:06,220 --> 01:53:06,700
Yeah.

2834
01:53:08,520 --> 01:53:09,520
I love it.

2835
01:53:09,520 --> 01:53:12,740
I love it when launch day bugs are like this.

2836
01:53:17,800 --> 01:53:18,280
Alright.

2837
01:53:18,400 --> 01:53:19,660
Let's try out Rampart.

2838
01:53:21,300 --> 01:53:21,940
Alright.

2839
01:53:21,940 --> 01:53:23,960
What games have you been playing, Tenjin?

2840
01:53:25,440 --> 01:53:26,460
I'll be honest.

2841
01:53:27,540 --> 01:53:28,640
GTA RP.

2842
01:53:28,860 --> 01:53:30,900
You've been doing GTA RP?

2843
01:53:31,820 --> 01:53:32,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2844
01:53:33,320 --> 01:53:34,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2845
01:53:34,680 --> 01:53:36,180
In Indonesia?

2846
01:53:36,740 --> 01:53:39,220
Yeah, the Indonesian side of the servers basically.

2847
01:53:40,580 --> 01:53:42,680
I am actually enjoying it.

2848
01:53:42,820 --> 01:53:44,700
And I have not touched FPS.

2849
01:53:44,880 --> 01:53:49,040
GTA RP has been like a big thing back in like NA times.

2850
01:53:49,660 --> 01:53:50,040
I know.

2851
01:53:50,040 --> 01:53:50,760
Like a couple years back.

2852
01:53:51,860 --> 01:53:55,420
It's funny that it hit Asia like last year.

2853
01:53:56,100 --> 01:53:57,140
I think that's funny.

2854
01:53:57,140 --> 01:53:58,220
It's not exactly last year.

2855
01:53:58,300 --> 01:53:59,980
It's been there for quite a while.

2856
01:54:00,100 --> 01:54:07,340
Yeah, but like the... Because in Asia, the most popular one is still the GTA San Andreas role-playing stuff.

2857
01:54:07,460 --> 01:54:07,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2858
01:54:07,560 --> 01:54:09,980
Yeah, but like it got like more popular.

2859
01:54:10,080 --> 01:54:11,420
Like the...

2860
01:54:11,420 --> 01:54:12,360
Yeah.

2861
01:54:12,380 --> 01:54:13,880
It like blew up last year.

2862
01:54:13,920 --> 01:54:18,080
People... It's more accessible now, basically, to play GTA 5.

2863
01:54:18,600 --> 01:54:19,640
So... Yeah.

2864
01:54:19,660 --> 01:54:19,840
Yeah.

2865
01:54:22,800 --> 01:54:23,240
Alright.

2866
01:54:23,840 --> 01:54:24,680
Here we go.

2867
01:54:24,940 --> 01:54:27,000
I can't wait to see your outplays.

2868
01:54:29,940 --> 01:54:32,980
Honestly, I haven't even like tried the invisible yet.

2869
01:54:33,240 --> 01:54:33,680
You haven't tried?

2870
01:54:33,760 --> 01:54:35,260
Wait, you haven't done the invisibility?

2871
01:54:35,480 --> 01:54:36,080
What have you been doing?

2872
01:54:36,080 --> 01:54:36,580
I haven't.

2873
01:54:36,880 --> 01:54:40,500
I've been grabbing the other stuff and showed it like sick crypto plays.

2874
01:54:40,880 --> 01:54:41,260
What?

2875
01:54:41,540 --> 01:54:44,500
You haven't been doing like the main part?

2876
01:54:45,120 --> 01:54:46,300
Oh, I'm at a pool.

2877
01:54:48,100 --> 01:54:48,740
That's funny.

2878
01:54:49,880 --> 01:54:51,700
Emily, you haven't been doing the main...

2879
01:54:51,700 --> 01:54:52,860
I have not.

2880
01:54:53,060 --> 01:54:54,400
Oh my god.

2881
01:54:54,560 --> 01:54:54,860
I can...

2882
01:54:54,860 --> 01:54:55,760
What ping is this?

2883
01:54:55,880 --> 01:54:56,180
Oh, 2-1.

2884
01:54:56,220 --> 01:54:56,340
Okay.

2885
01:54:56,520 --> 01:54:56,920
Yeah.

2886
01:55:01,160 --> 01:55:01,560
Okay.

2887
01:55:01,800 --> 01:55:02,200
Okay.

2888
01:55:03,900 --> 01:55:05,840
Well, what do you think about the health bar, though?

2889
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:06,440
Health bar?

2890
01:55:06,520 --> 01:55:08,580
I don't like it that much, to be fair.

2891
01:55:09,400 --> 01:55:09,800
What the fuck?

2892
01:55:09,800 --> 01:55:10,200
Yeah, me neither.

2893
01:55:10,780 --> 01:55:12,680
Like the highlight is nice, but like...

2894
01:55:13,160 --> 01:55:13,560
Guys.

2895
01:55:16,500 --> 01:55:17,040
Hey, guys.

2896
01:55:17,040 --> 01:55:17,300
Hey, guys.

2897
01:55:17,620 --> 01:55:19,360
I have a lifeline on me.

2898
01:55:19,800 --> 01:55:21,160
I had a lifeline.

2899
01:55:21,180 --> 01:55:22,720
And I had a winning man.

2900
01:55:24,520 --> 01:55:24,960
Oh.

2901
01:55:25,100 --> 01:55:25,940
He's over here.

2902
01:55:26,280 --> 01:55:26,720
Tension.

2903
01:55:27,140 --> 01:55:27,920
Beat him up.

2904
01:55:29,360 --> 01:55:31,040
I cracked him twice already.

2905
01:55:31,200 --> 01:55:31,720
Beat him up.

2906
01:55:31,740 --> 01:55:32,040
Whoa.

2907
01:55:34,340 --> 01:55:35,180
I'll just res you.

2908
01:55:35,320 --> 01:55:36,420
Yeah, just res me.

2909
01:55:37,020 --> 01:55:37,700
It's fast.

2910
01:55:38,940 --> 01:55:40,040
No, it's not fast.

2911
01:55:40,240 --> 01:55:40,780
I got light.

2912
01:55:40,860 --> 01:55:42,700
I thought it was fast too, but it's not.

2913
01:55:43,560 --> 01:55:45,300
It's pretty slow, not gonna lie.

2914
01:55:48,080 --> 01:55:49,480
Oh my god, you're already off the grid.

2915
01:55:50,680 --> 01:55:51,460
I am.

2916
01:55:52,460 --> 01:55:53,620
Can I scan it again?

2917
01:55:53,740 --> 01:55:54,100
Oh wait.

2918
01:55:54,600 --> 01:55:55,040
Guys.

2919
01:55:55,300 --> 01:55:55,740
Guys.

2920
01:56:00,780 --> 01:56:02,620
I don't think I was... He's very low.

2921
01:56:03,140 --> 01:56:04,200
He's super low.

2922
01:56:07,900 --> 01:56:10,420
Someone get this wingman off my body.

2923
01:56:10,560 --> 01:56:11,600
Holy shit, he's super low.

2924
01:56:14,160 --> 01:56:14,640
Okay.

2925
01:56:14,740 --> 01:56:15,680
Bro, you have a wingman.

2926
01:56:15,760 --> 01:56:16,560
You should have won that.

2927
01:56:16,800 --> 01:56:17,580
What do you mean?

2928
01:56:17,700 --> 01:56:19,380
I played 200 ping wingman.

2929
01:56:19,840 --> 01:56:21,340
I was literally in NA.

2930
01:56:21,720 --> 01:56:23,320
I was in NA.

2931
01:56:23,720 --> 01:56:25,740
I forgot where you live sometimes.

2932
01:56:26,140 --> 01:56:28,120
What do you mean you forget where I live?

2933
01:56:32,180 --> 01:56:33,260
Someone get this.

2934
01:56:33,340 --> 01:56:34,380
Okay, I'm gonna throw this wingman.

2935
01:56:34,440 --> 01:56:35,500
You take the wingman.

2936
01:56:35,620 --> 01:56:36,520
I should not.

2937
01:56:36,840 --> 01:56:39,040
I spent too long off the grid.

2938
01:56:39,040 --> 01:56:41,820
I spent too long being invisible.

2939
01:56:48,600 --> 01:56:51,840
Also like, is this a bad time to tell you?

2940
01:56:51,880 --> 01:56:54,020
This might be my third time playing Rampart.

2941
01:56:54,260 --> 01:56:55,480
In my life.

2942
01:56:55,960 --> 01:56:57,980
Ever since Rampart came out.

2943
01:56:59,180 --> 01:57:02,460
I actually have not seen you play any other legends.

2944
01:57:02,940 --> 01:57:06,340
Yeah, I think this is a bad time to tell you that.

2945
01:57:07,080 --> 01:57:08,140
Yeah, I think this is a bad time to tell you that.

2946
01:57:08,140 --> 01:57:08,960
And they're over here.

2947
01:57:10,360 --> 01:57:11,560
Woah, what the fuck?

2948
01:57:16,580 --> 01:57:17,580
Oh, please.

2949
01:57:17,820 --> 01:57:18,860
What the fuck?

2950
01:57:18,880 --> 01:57:20,960
Where did she come from?

2951
01:57:21,840 --> 01:57:24,000
Where did this girl came from?

2952
01:57:25,660 --> 01:57:28,460
Okay, so there is the lifeline right here.

2953
01:57:28,700 --> 01:57:30,000
That I did not hear.

2954
01:57:31,460 --> 01:57:32,860
I swear to god.

2955
01:57:32,980 --> 01:57:34,080
I swear to god.

2956
01:57:34,220 --> 01:57:34,620
I swear.

2957
01:57:34,760 --> 01:57:36,620
I will come back and fucking kill you.

2958
01:57:39,340 --> 01:57:41,800
I will come back and kill you.

2959
01:57:43,100 --> 01:57:44,060
I will come back and kill you.

2960
01:57:44,120 --> 01:57:46,260
Please do not kill this lifeline.

2961
01:57:46,360 --> 01:57:47,140
I swear to god.

2962
01:57:47,300 --> 01:57:48,900
I need to kill her myself.

2963
01:57:50,240 --> 01:57:51,500
Come on, fight your demons.

2964
01:57:54,520 --> 01:57:55,840
Oh, I see.

2965
01:57:55,940 --> 01:57:56,740
I see you.

2966
01:57:57,400 --> 01:57:59,880
I'm coming back just for the lifeline.

2967
01:58:00,500 --> 01:58:01,960
I need a second gun though.

2968
01:58:02,020 --> 01:58:02,680
That's all I need.

2969
01:58:02,680 --> 01:58:04,840
I'm still...

2970
01:58:05,640 --> 01:58:06,700
Oh, there they are.

2971
01:58:08,460 --> 01:58:09,320
Where are they?

2972
01:58:09,380 --> 01:58:09,640
Here?

2973
01:58:10,820 --> 01:58:12,520
Let the lifeline live.

2974
01:58:13,420 --> 01:58:14,340
I need...

2975
01:58:14,340 --> 01:58:15,780
The lifeline has to live.

2976
01:58:16,220 --> 01:58:17,240
Oh my god.

2977
01:58:17,320 --> 01:58:18,260
Okay, I fucked up.

2978
01:58:18,360 --> 01:58:18,860
Already.

2979
01:58:21,920 --> 01:58:22,440
Okay.

2980
01:58:23,600 --> 01:58:24,600
Wait, where are they?

2981
01:58:26,200 --> 01:58:27,840
I'm literally fighting both of them.

2982
01:58:28,080 --> 01:58:29,820
No, the lifeline has to live.

2983
01:58:30,540 --> 01:58:31,940
Oh, the lifeline is...

2984
01:58:31,940 --> 01:58:33,260
The lifeline is alive.

2985
01:58:33,440 --> 01:58:33,960
Somewhere.

2986
01:58:34,380 --> 01:58:35,480
The lifeline!

2987
01:58:35,600 --> 01:58:37,920
You have to let me get the lifeline.

2988
01:58:38,060 --> 01:58:39,260
That's all I want.

2989
01:58:42,420 --> 01:58:44,420
The lifeline has to live.

2990
01:58:44,560 --> 01:58:45,280
That should be the lifeline.

2991
01:58:45,560 --> 01:58:46,860
Where are you, lifeline?

2992
01:58:48,380 --> 01:58:49,340
Where is she?

2993
01:58:50,100 --> 01:58:51,540
Where the fuck is she?

2994
01:58:52,820 --> 01:58:53,340
Where?

2995
01:58:55,620 --> 01:58:56,820
Where is she?

2996
01:58:59,780 --> 01:59:00,260
Where is she?

2997
01:59:00,260 --> 01:59:00,600
Is she inside?

2998
01:59:00,980 --> 01:59:01,620
Is she...

2999
01:59:01,620 --> 01:59:04,340
I swear I haven't even gotten like a fucking...

3000
01:59:04,340 --> 01:59:04,940
Where the fuck is she?

3001
01:59:05,160 --> 01:59:06,840
She has high ground!

3002
01:59:07,260 --> 01:59:08,520
This bitch!

3003
01:59:09,820 --> 01:59:11,320
I don't have shields.

3004
01:59:11,720 --> 01:59:12,640
Do you have shields?

3005
01:59:12,700 --> 01:59:14,160
I do, I do, I do.

3006
01:59:14,300 --> 01:59:16,300
I don't have shields, this fucker.

3007
01:59:16,700 --> 01:59:19,800
She's like actually the bane of my existence right now.

3008
01:59:20,520 --> 01:59:22,180
I don't even have an attachment.

3009
01:59:23,580 --> 01:59:24,860
Ooh, a golden...

3010
01:59:24,860 --> 01:59:25,920
Yeah, you know what?

3011
01:59:25,940 --> 01:59:26,140
This works.

3012
01:59:26,820 --> 01:59:28,640
Yeah, dude, fuck this bitch!

3013
01:59:30,240 --> 01:59:31,220
There, fight him.

3014
01:59:33,660 --> 01:59:34,640
Where is she?

3015
01:59:34,760 --> 01:59:35,560
Oh, I think someone fell.

3016
01:59:36,360 --> 01:59:37,320
Lifeline zombie!

3017
01:59:38,440 --> 01:59:39,660
Lifeline zombie, where is she?

3018
01:59:40,240 --> 01:59:41,080
Where is she?

3019
01:59:42,420 --> 01:59:43,520
Where'd she go?

3020
01:59:43,840 --> 01:59:44,780
Where did she go?

3021
01:59:45,620 --> 01:59:46,620
Oh, she's right here.

3022
01:59:46,620 --> 01:59:48,120
Where did she go?

3023
01:59:49,040 --> 01:59:52,100
Where did she go?

3024
01:59:55,860 --> 01:59:57,540
Let her respawn!

3025
01:59:58,160 --> 01:59:59,540
Don't kill this team!

3026
01:59:59,700 --> 02:00:01,260
Fully let her respawn!

3027
02:00:03,260 --> 02:00:04,600
That's all I want.

3028
02:00:04,940 --> 02:00:06,060
Where is she?

3029
02:00:06,740 --> 02:00:08,740
I want the lifeline to come back.

3030
02:00:08,960 --> 02:00:10,200
I need her to come back.

3031
02:00:13,060 --> 02:00:14,400
I need her.

3032
02:00:17,080 --> 02:00:18,080
After today.

3033
02:00:22,360 --> 02:00:24,100
Let her come respawn.

3034
02:00:24,860 --> 02:00:26,240
What the fuck do I want?

3035
02:00:26,280 --> 02:00:27,200
Reduce all cooldown?

3036
02:00:27,580 --> 02:00:27,880
Okay.

3037
02:00:29,320 --> 02:00:29,960
Why not?

3038
02:00:30,140 --> 02:00:30,760
Where did she go?

3039
02:00:31,480 --> 02:00:32,280
Where are they?

3040
02:00:32,460 --> 02:00:32,880
I don't know.

3041
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:35,900
Where are they?

3042
02:00:36,880 --> 02:00:39,600
I need... I need... fucking... what's her name?

3043
02:00:39,700 --> 02:00:41,620
That extra shield in the save zone is nice though.

3044
02:00:41,920 --> 02:00:42,940
Yeah, that is nice.

3045
02:00:43,140 --> 02:00:44,000
Where is she?

3046
02:00:44,780 --> 02:00:45,800
Where's the lifeline?

3047
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:50,300
I need her to keep respawning two more times.

3048
02:00:50,700 --> 02:00:51,620
Before I...

3049
02:00:52,600 --> 02:00:54,140
She craves violence.

3050
02:00:54,620 --> 02:00:56,220
Where did they go?

3051
02:00:56,460 --> 02:00:57,220
Did they run?

3052
02:00:58,040 --> 02:00:59,880
Did they fucking run?

3053
02:01:00,120 --> 02:01:01,840
Those pussies!

3054
02:01:02,120 --> 02:01:02,440
Quiet.

3055
02:01:03,380 --> 02:01:05,260
I can't believe they actually ran.

3056
02:01:05,500 --> 02:01:06,250
Holy fuck.

3057
02:01:06,980 --> 02:01:08,880
It's been all quiet so yeah they might be running.

3058
02:01:08,880 --> 02:01:10,340
I can't believe it.

3059
02:01:10,480 --> 02:01:12,600
I can't believe those cowards!

3060
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:17,140
It's actually fucked up.

3061
02:01:17,820 --> 02:01:19,460
It's so fucked up.

3062
02:01:20,700 --> 02:01:21,360
Alright.

3063
02:01:22,100 --> 02:01:23,360
We gotta go find them.

3064
02:01:24,560 --> 02:01:25,640
We have...

3065
02:01:25,640 --> 02:01:27,180
It's not over yet.

3066
02:01:27,780 --> 02:01:29,200
It's not over.

3067
02:01:29,200 --> 02:01:31,260
It's far from over.

3068
02:01:35,060 --> 02:01:39,700
They got me at a bad time while I was trying to adjust to your ping.

3069
02:01:43,600 --> 02:01:44,880
I'm not gonna...

3070
02:01:44,880 --> 02:01:46,300
But it doesn't reach like six shields.

3071
02:01:46,620 --> 02:01:47,820
It's only like five.

3072
02:01:47,820 --> 02:01:48,540
Yeah.

3073
02:01:48,660 --> 02:01:53,380
Okay so does it feel like the map isn't optimized or is just my end?

3074
02:01:55,080 --> 02:01:55,640
Um...

3075
02:01:56,600 --> 02:01:57,560
I don't know.

3076
02:01:57,800 --> 02:01:58,360
Cause like...

3077
02:01:58,360 --> 02:02:00,800
I just upgraded my graphics card so I wouldn't know.

3078
02:02:00,800 --> 02:02:02,680
Yeah I'm on M40 but like...

3079
02:02:02,680 --> 02:02:04,260
I think I might just need...

3080
02:02:04,260 --> 02:02:08,640
I might need more RAM too cause like I noticed like ever since I swapped my CPU...

3081
02:02:08,640 --> 02:02:08,780
Yeah it's 170.

3082
02:02:10,060 --> 02:02:17,480
When I swapped my CPU and motherboard my RAM usage got like insane.

3083
02:02:17,480 --> 02:02:17,800
When I swapped my CPU and motherboard my RAM usage got like insane.

3084
02:02:17,800 --> 02:02:18,960
So I don't know.

3085
02:02:19,060 --> 02:02:20,000
I don't know if it's like...

3086
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:24,220
Has a deal with also my CPU and also my motherboard.

3087
02:02:26,420 --> 02:02:28,360
No I know that lifeline is still alive.

3088
02:02:29,920 --> 02:02:31,540
I know you're still fucking alive.

3089
02:02:31,660 --> 02:02:32,160
Is that you?

3090
02:02:32,740 --> 02:02:33,500
Is that you?

3091
02:02:34,760 --> 02:02:35,640
Oh shit!

3092
02:02:37,600 --> 02:02:38,040
Why?

3093
02:02:39,140 --> 02:02:39,380
Why?

3094
02:02:39,500 --> 02:02:40,180
Every time.

3095
02:02:41,560 --> 02:02:42,440
Every time.

3096
02:02:43,100 --> 02:02:45,380
Every time I wanna get into a different fight.

3097
02:02:45,600 --> 02:02:46,640
This is not fair.

3098
02:02:47,920 --> 02:02:48,900
They're over there.

3099
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:49,940
To your left.

3100
02:02:50,640 --> 02:02:51,300
I'm buggin'.

3101
02:02:53,620 --> 02:02:54,780
Building walls.

3102
02:02:55,180 --> 02:02:56,240
Funny buggin'.

3103
02:02:56,240 --> 02:02:57,800
I'm building walls.

3104
02:02:58,280 --> 02:02:59,120
Where are they?

3105
02:03:01,620 --> 02:03:03,120
Yo they're so far!

3106
02:03:07,340 --> 02:03:08,480
They're super far.

3107
02:03:08,680 --> 02:03:11,540
Yeah they're so far but they're being little bitches!

3108
02:03:14,140 --> 02:03:15,180
They're super far.

3109
02:03:15,340 --> 02:03:15,800
What the fuck?

3110
02:03:15,900 --> 02:03:16,300
They're not...

3111
02:03:17,800 --> 02:03:18,400
Somebody's on me.

3112
02:03:18,860 --> 02:03:19,660
Yeah yeah yeah.

3113
02:03:19,900 --> 02:03:20,820
Multiple of them.

3114
02:03:21,480 --> 02:03:22,560
I need help.

3115
02:03:23,800 --> 02:03:24,320
Sure.

3116
02:03:24,320 --> 02:03:24,840
Nevermind.

3117
02:03:25,060 --> 02:03:26,000
They destroyed my drone.

3118
02:03:26,280 --> 02:03:27,860
I'll get to you.

3119
02:03:28,500 --> 02:03:29,360
I hope so.

3120
02:03:29,800 --> 02:03:31,000
Cause they're literally on me.

3121
02:03:35,930 --> 02:03:37,050
Miss didn't see me?

3122
02:03:38,870 --> 02:03:39,390
Oh.

3123
02:03:42,310 --> 02:03:42,830
Hahaha!

3124
02:03:43,630 --> 02:03:44,150
Haha!

3125
02:03:44,150 --> 02:03:44,230
Haha!

3126
02:03:47,690 --> 02:03:49,310
Oh our Watson was not...

3127
02:03:49,310 --> 02:03:49,990
I got you.

3128
02:03:50,110 --> 02:03:50,370
I got you.

3129
02:03:51,410 --> 02:03:51,770
Uh...

3130
02:03:51,770 --> 02:03:52,690
Where is he?

3131
02:03:52,870 --> 02:03:53,110
Woah!

3132
02:03:53,430 --> 02:03:55,690
What the fuck kind of movement tech are you watching?

3133
02:03:55,810 --> 02:03:56,170
Woah!

3134
02:03:56,750 --> 02:03:58,210
Where is he?

3135
02:03:58,290 --> 02:03:58,930
Where did he go?

3136
02:03:59,250 --> 02:04:00,730
Where did he go?

3137
02:04:00,790 --> 02:04:01,610
Where did he come from?

3138
02:04:02,670 --> 02:04:03,850
Wait actually where is he?

3139
02:04:04,070 --> 02:04:05,130
Wait that's a different guy!

3140
02:04:05,190 --> 02:04:06,010
That's a different guy homie.

3141
02:04:07,170 --> 02:04:07,530
Hello.

3142
02:04:08,250 --> 02:04:09,210
I'm fighting another guy.

3143
02:04:09,290 --> 02:04:10,430
I'm batting.

3144
02:04:10,470 --> 02:04:11,810
It's okay our Watson's coming back soon.

3145
02:04:14,830 --> 02:04:15,530
I'm dead.

3146
02:04:15,890 --> 02:04:16,450
I'm dead.

3147
02:04:16,450 --> 02:04:18,590
Oh it's okay our Watson's gonna clutch this up.

3148
02:04:18,610 --> 02:04:19,470
At being alive.

3149
02:04:21,030 --> 02:04:22,110
Jesus Christ.

3150
02:04:22,190 --> 02:04:23,170
Fight me bro fight me.

3151
02:04:24,310 --> 02:04:25,510
I'm just gonna bleed out.

3152
02:04:26,290 --> 02:04:27,290
That's a good idea.

3153
02:04:28,650 --> 02:04:29,210
No!

3154
02:04:29,450 --> 02:04:30,430
I got pinged!

3155
02:04:31,010 --> 02:04:32,330
Are you fucking...

3156
02:04:35,120 --> 02:04:36,600
I hit two!

3157
02:04:37,300 --> 02:04:37,980
It's okay.

3158
02:04:38,120 --> 02:04:38,900
Camila please!

3159
02:04:39,680 --> 02:04:41,580
Don't land on them I swear to god!

3160
02:04:41,820 --> 02:04:42,920
23 seconds.

3161
02:04:43,180 --> 02:04:43,920
Just leave them.

3162
02:04:45,120 --> 02:04:46,480
I'm in second ping.

3163
02:04:46,700 --> 02:04:47,600
20 seconds.

3164
02:04:47,820 --> 02:04:48,640
It's enough!

3165
02:04:48,760 --> 02:04:49,600
It's enough time!

3166
02:04:49,720 --> 02:04:50,060
Please!

3167
02:04:50,060 --> 02:04:50,300
Please!

3168
02:04:50,540 --> 02:04:51,840
Don't go in there!

3169
02:04:52,120 --> 02:04:52,540
Please!

3170
02:04:52,660 --> 02:04:53,480
I beg of you!

3171
02:04:53,600 --> 02:04:54,100
Don't even fight this!

3172
02:04:54,160 --> 02:04:55,460
Just like calm down.

3173
02:04:55,680 --> 02:04:57,040
I got pinged.

3174
02:04:57,040 --> 02:04:58,140
I got pinged so high.

3175
02:04:58,780 --> 02:04:59,540
Go park!

3176
02:04:59,780 --> 02:05:00,400
Park your car!

3177
02:05:00,860 --> 02:05:02,660
Go park your car!

3178
02:05:05,800 --> 02:05:07,080
Alright I need...

3179
02:05:07,080 --> 02:05:09,980
Yeah this map is like overly complex as shit.

3180
02:05:10,240 --> 02:05:11,420
Oh yeah no 100%.

3181
02:05:11,800 --> 02:05:13,740
Like 180 FPS.

3182
02:05:13,940 --> 02:05:14,480
Yeah yeah yeah.

3183
02:05:14,480 --> 02:05:15,620
Like there's a lot of stuff.

3184
02:05:16,560 --> 02:05:17,640
Like holy shit.

3185
02:05:18,560 --> 02:05:19,440
Okay we're live.

3186
02:05:19,460 --> 02:05:20,260
I don't know if I like it.

3187
02:05:21,060 --> 02:05:23,340
It's just a lot of the same thing.

3188
02:05:24,220 --> 02:05:25,440
Yeah it is.

3189
02:05:26,080 --> 02:05:27,620
It's just everything in one place.

3190
02:05:27,780 --> 02:05:29,840
I absolutely hate the high ground.

3191
02:05:30,400 --> 02:05:33,540
I fucking... that was one of my complaints during testing.

3192
02:05:34,240 --> 02:05:35,340
During the play testing.

3193
02:05:36,060 --> 02:05:39,700
The high ground is like so bullshit sometimes.

3194
02:05:39,920 --> 02:05:40,720
Cause it's like...

3195
02:05:41,420 --> 02:05:42,580
Really high high ground.

3196
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:46,520
Yeah yeah it's like super high.

3197
02:05:46,860 --> 02:05:48,100
Do you need this?

3198
02:05:48,360 --> 02:05:49,720
What is this?

3199
02:05:49,940 --> 02:05:50,520
The new stuff.

3200
02:05:51,240 --> 02:05:53,960
Nope but I will find a gun for it.

3201
02:05:54,860 --> 02:05:56,080
I mean you're playing Ramparts.

3202
02:05:56,560 --> 02:05:57,700
I think you should be playing the LNG.

3203
02:05:57,700 --> 02:05:57,720
I should.

3204
02:06:03,600 --> 02:06:04,860
The high ground.

3205
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:06,800
I just hate the high ground so much.

3206
02:06:07,240 --> 02:06:08,800
The stutter!

3207
02:06:09,720 --> 02:06:12,860
I looked up into the city and I got the stutter.

3208
02:06:14,100 --> 02:06:15,040
I might have to...

3209
02:06:15,040 --> 02:06:16,680
360hz mod or some shit?

3210
02:06:16,880 --> 02:06:18,800
I have like a 280hz.

3211
02:06:18,940 --> 02:06:19,420
But like...

3212
02:06:19,420 --> 02:06:22,080
Every time I look at a specific direction.

3213
02:06:22,220 --> 02:06:23,960
I have a really bad stutter.

3214
02:06:24,740 --> 02:06:26,080
Like a terror huh?

3215
02:06:26,320 --> 02:06:27,120
Woah woah woah woah.

3216
02:06:30,180 --> 02:06:30,820
Where are they?

3217
02:06:31,680 --> 02:06:32,620
Oh it's over there.

3218
02:06:33,640 --> 02:06:34,880
Yeah the big stutter.

3219
02:06:35,300 --> 02:06:37,900
I will always have PC problems.

3220
02:06:37,980 --> 02:06:38,940
No matter where I go.

3221
02:06:39,100 --> 02:06:41,440
Every time I feel like I fixed my PC issue.

3222
02:06:41,440 --> 02:06:42,480
It just comes back.

3223
02:06:43,540 --> 02:06:44,100
No!

3224
02:06:44,760 --> 02:06:45,820
He's super low!

3225
02:06:47,200 --> 02:06:47,600
He's outside.

3226
02:06:48,340 --> 02:06:49,000
Playing up.

3227
02:06:49,900 --> 02:06:51,120
Res me please.

3228
02:06:53,360 --> 02:06:54,220
I got him.

3229
02:06:55,540 --> 02:06:56,460
I got him.

3230
02:06:58,240 --> 02:07:00,340
Watch with you and PC problems.

3231
02:07:00,500 --> 02:07:01,020
I don't know.

3232
02:07:01,160 --> 02:07:03,220
I'm that unlucky no matter what happens.

3233
02:07:14,880 --> 02:07:15,840
Tell Zach!

3234
02:07:18,340 --> 02:07:19,260
No but...

3235
02:07:21,380 --> 02:07:23,180
Don't need a wall for that.

3236
02:07:24,760 --> 02:07:25,940
I'm afraid guys.

3237
02:07:26,180 --> 02:07:26,480
I'm afraid.

3238
02:07:27,240 --> 02:07:28,360
Bloodhound right here on me.

3239
02:07:29,100 --> 02:07:29,820
By himself.

3240
02:07:30,780 --> 02:07:31,480
On me.

3241
02:07:32,320 --> 02:07:32,880
Okay.

3242
02:07:35,080 --> 02:07:35,640
Down.

3243
02:07:40,220 --> 02:07:42,160
I go brrrr.

3244
02:07:44,200 --> 02:07:45,300
Woah woah woah woah.

3245
02:07:45,540 --> 02:07:46,260
Don't worry.

3246
02:07:48,280 --> 02:07:48,660
I'm doing the wrong thing.

3247
02:07:49,640 --> 02:07:51,100
If they come to me.

3248
02:07:51,200 --> 02:07:52,320
If they come to me though.

3249
02:07:53,480 --> 02:07:54,780
If they come to you.

3250
02:07:55,580 --> 02:07:56,600
What if they didn't?

3251
02:07:59,320 --> 02:08:00,920
If they don't then...

3252
02:08:00,920 --> 02:08:01,740
Woah they didn't.

3253
02:08:02,260 --> 02:08:03,060
They didn't.

3254
02:08:03,180 --> 02:08:06,240
They clearly didn't come to you.

3255
02:08:06,400 --> 02:08:07,240
I'll just move out.

3256
02:08:07,320 --> 02:08:07,700
Good luck.

3257
02:08:07,880 --> 02:08:08,220
Please.

3258
02:08:12,920 --> 02:08:13,360
Nooooooooooo!

3259
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:14,880
Oh I'm dead.

3260
02:08:15,020 --> 02:08:15,660
There's no way.

3261
02:08:18,460 --> 02:08:20,300
They found me!

3262
02:08:20,960 --> 02:08:21,520
No!

3263
02:08:22,280 --> 02:08:23,780
They found me!

3264
02:08:24,340 --> 02:08:25,640
Is that your cue of me?

3265
02:08:25,740 --> 02:08:27,580
Cue for us?

3266
02:08:28,140 --> 02:08:28,700
No!

3267
02:08:29,320 --> 02:08:31,960
Are you not cued?

3268
02:08:32,380 --> 02:08:33,180
I am.

3269
02:08:33,280 --> 02:08:34,880
Okay, I'm in your party.

3270
02:08:36,120 --> 02:08:37,460
I don't know.

3271
02:08:37,780 --> 02:08:40,220
I also think it's just this map.

3272
02:08:40,420 --> 02:08:40,920
In general.

3273
02:08:41,420 --> 02:08:44,400
When I swapped my AMD...

3274
02:08:44,400 --> 02:08:46,180
When I swapped to AMD...

3275
02:08:46,180 --> 02:08:48,280
My RAM usage...

3276
02:08:48,280 --> 02:08:48,820
increased.

3277
02:08:49,220 --> 02:08:51,320
I'm at like 90%.

3278
02:08:52,010 --> 02:08:54,940
90% That happens for AMD?

3279
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:57,840
If I'm not mistaken.

3280
02:08:58,040 --> 02:08:58,680
Yes, lately.

3281
02:08:58,980 --> 02:09:01,540
What happened to our third?

3282
02:09:03,800 --> 02:09:04,920
Where's our third?

3283
02:09:05,720 --> 02:09:07,340
Okay, let's leave.

3284
02:09:07,870 --> 02:09:09,320
Because I don't want to play Rampart.

3285
02:09:09,480 --> 02:09:13,340
We're gonna die with these selections.

3286
02:09:14,260 --> 02:09:16,100
Do you remember to say...

3287
02:09:16,180 --> 02:09:16,400
XMP?

3288
02:09:16,540 --> 02:09:17,320
Well, I don't know.

3289
02:09:18,740 --> 02:09:19,620
Have you?

3290
02:09:20,040 --> 02:09:20,700
I don't know.

3291
02:09:20,740 --> 02:09:22,320
I put it in the...

3292
02:09:24,320 --> 02:09:26,160
computer place to do it for me.

3293
02:09:26,380 --> 02:09:27,240
So I don't know.

3294
02:09:27,540 --> 02:09:28,160
Have they?

3295
02:09:28,760 --> 02:09:30,280
I assume they would have.

3296
02:09:31,240 --> 02:09:33,540
That's also why I'm studying really hard.

3297
02:09:33,780 --> 02:09:35,720
So I don't know if I should...

3298
02:09:36,180 --> 02:09:38,040
I don't know if I should...

3299
02:09:38,500 --> 02:09:39,800
I still left by the way.

3300
02:09:39,820 --> 02:09:40,880
Because I don't want to play Rampart anymore.

3301
02:09:41,040 --> 02:09:41,640
Fuck Rampart.

3302
02:09:42,560 --> 02:09:45,760
I had no option to leave.

3303
02:09:47,160 --> 02:09:48,040
Fuck Rampart.

3304
02:09:48,120 --> 02:09:49,100
I'm gonna try Advantage.

3305
02:09:49,900 --> 02:09:51,200
I'm gonna try Advantage.

3306
02:09:51,420 --> 02:09:52,620
No, I'm gonna try Gimpy!

3307
02:09:53,640 --> 02:09:54,600
He's so fun.

3308
02:09:54,760 --> 02:09:55,920
I am gonna try Gimpy.

3309
02:09:57,880 --> 02:09:58,760
My RAM speed?

3310
02:09:58,980 --> 02:10:00,380
Okay, I'll read my RAM speed, guys.

3311
02:10:00,680 --> 02:10:01,660
Alright, how do I do that?

3312
02:10:01,740 --> 02:10:02,520
Yeah, I'm at like 80...

3313
02:10:03,660 --> 02:10:06,760
I'm at 85% memory right now.

3314
02:10:07,080 --> 02:10:09,360
Like Task Manager performance and click memory?

3315
02:10:09,560 --> 02:10:10,920
There should be like... speed.

3316
02:10:11,300 --> 02:10:12,160
I'm at...

3317
02:10:13,600 --> 02:10:14,040
Speed.

3318
02:10:14,180 --> 02:10:15,080
Okay, speed.

3319
02:10:16,180 --> 02:10:17,640
50,000MT per second.

3320
02:10:18,140 --> 02:10:19,000
That's normal.

3321
02:10:19,320 --> 02:10:20,320
That's normal, yeah.

3322
02:10:21,020 --> 02:10:21,960
DDR5, right?

3323
02:10:23,720 --> 02:10:25,200
How do I see that?

3324
02:10:26,280 --> 02:10:26,980
God damn.

3325
02:10:27,220 --> 02:10:28,500
Well, I'm assuming it is.

3326
02:10:28,520 --> 02:10:31,340
Because mine is still 3000.

3327
02:10:32,080 --> 02:10:33,320
Yeah, I don't...

3328
02:10:33,320 --> 02:10:35,320
The stutters happened...

3329
02:10:35,320 --> 02:10:37,740
Ever since I swapped AMD.

3330
02:10:37,980 --> 02:10:39,800
So, I think I might just need more RAM.

3331
02:10:40,760 --> 02:10:42,440
I think, I have 32 RAM.

3332
02:10:42,900 --> 02:10:44,360
So I think I just need like...

3333
02:10:44,360 --> 02:10:46,860
What CPU did you get anyway?

3334
02:10:47,300 --> 02:10:48,300
I don't remember.

3335
02:10:49,680 --> 02:10:55,340
I don't remember because they said that a new AMD CPU was releasing in a few months.

3336
02:10:55,700 --> 02:10:57,820
But then I was like, obviously I need to fix it now.

3337
02:10:59,120 --> 02:11:04,240
And so I was like, give me the last... the best one.

3338
02:11:04,320 --> 02:11:04,740
Whatever the best you got.

3339
02:11:05,220 --> 02:11:05,940
Yeah, whatever the best you have.

3340
02:11:07,380 --> 02:11:11,180
But I'm already using 85% of my memory, which is not good.

3341
02:11:11,900 --> 02:11:14,000
How many memories do you have?

3342
02:11:14,460 --> 02:11:20,520
Like, let's see... OPS is using... what the fuck?

3343
02:11:20,820 --> 02:11:24,280
Yeah, but like in performance, how many gigs do you have?

3344
02:11:24,740 --> 02:11:25,280
How many gigs?

3345
02:11:25,400 --> 02:11:25,900
I have 32.

3346
02:11:26,820 --> 02:11:27,900
I have 48.

3347
02:11:28,740 --> 02:11:29,700
You're missing out.

3348
02:11:30,140 --> 02:11:31,240
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

3349
02:11:31,320 --> 02:11:31,880
I need more RAM.

3350
02:11:32,140 --> 02:11:33,280
You need 64.

3351
02:11:33,860 --> 02:11:34,560
Why not?

3352
02:11:34,860 --> 02:11:36,520
Nah, I mean, you have the money!

3353
02:11:38,560 --> 02:11:41,160
I'm sure $110 RAM is enough.

3354
02:11:44,500 --> 02:11:48,560
Because Apex is using 3000 MB right now.

3355
02:11:48,920 --> 02:11:51,480
I don't know if I should have OBS on admin mode as well.

3356
02:11:51,620 --> 02:11:52,820
Maybe I should try it for...

3357
02:11:53,760 --> 02:11:55,460
You don't have OBS in admin mode?

3358
02:11:55,540 --> 02:11:55,700
Why?

3359
02:11:56,080 --> 02:11:59,580
No, it goes... I sometimes forget Because I, I... my new PC...

3360
02:11:59,580 --> 02:12:00,880
My old PC I had it automatically.

3361
02:12:01,160 --> 02:12:02,320
Cuz, you know, the settings.

3362
02:12:02,520 --> 02:12:04,240
But a new PC I never really...

3363
02:12:04,240 --> 02:12:07,200
I haven't really, like, put it on as automatically.

3364
02:12:08,480 --> 02:12:11,160
Does it only happens on stream or like... when...

3365
02:12:11,160 --> 02:12:11,160
on stream?

3366
02:12:11,180 --> 02:12:13,960
No, it's just like... this Apex just now.

3367
02:12:14,240 --> 02:12:15,240
It's just Apex.

3368
02:12:15,240 --> 02:12:16,840
But like now, right now.

3369
02:12:17,040 --> 02:12:18,240
Like Apex before was fine.

3370
02:12:18,360 --> 02:12:20,540
Like to be fair, I haven't used AMD on Apex yet.

3371
02:12:20,720 --> 02:12:21,720
This is the first time.

3372
02:12:25,020 --> 02:12:32,720
This is the first time I've used Apex for AMD, which is causing the stutters.

3373
02:12:33,920 --> 02:12:34,440
What?

3374
02:12:36,160 --> 02:12:37,720
What did he say?

3375
02:12:38,100 --> 02:12:39,860
What did he say?

3376
02:12:43,540 --> 02:12:44,300
Who jumped?

3377
02:12:44,580 --> 02:12:45,280
Who jumped?

3378
02:12:45,540 --> 02:12:46,540
Why is no one wanting to jump?

3379
02:12:46,840 --> 02:12:47,320
Jump!

3380
02:12:47,760 --> 02:12:48,420
Thank you.

3381
02:12:51,680 --> 02:12:52,160
Alright.

3382
02:12:54,020 --> 02:12:55,900
Okay, I need the shield thingy.

3383
02:12:55,920 --> 02:12:58,620
That like... the LMG shield thingy.

3384
02:13:03,400 --> 02:13:06,020
That's why like I felt like it was like from the map too.

3385
02:13:06,420 --> 02:13:07,960
Because like, you know.

3386
02:13:08,060 --> 02:13:10,720
Unless like I could try a different map and...

3387
02:13:11,180 --> 02:13:12,100
see if it's still the same.

3388
02:13:12,420 --> 02:13:19,060
Honestly, I get like 170 for the least amount basically.

3389
02:13:19,980 --> 02:13:21,640
And for me, it's no problem.

3390
02:13:22,880 --> 02:13:27,240
I mean I pretty much played Apex with 40 FPS back then when it was released.

3391
02:13:27,620 --> 02:13:28,660
I'm kind of just yeah.

3392
02:13:28,720 --> 02:13:29,820
Well I'm seeing it good.

3393
02:13:32,380 --> 02:13:34,000
So that's why I'm like... I don't know.

3394
02:13:34,060 --> 02:13:35,780
I don't know if it's like from...

3395
02:13:37,600 --> 02:13:38,000
From...

3396
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:38,060
Oh!

3397
02:13:38,180 --> 02:13:39,700
I got the- Oh, no.

3398
02:13:39,740 --> 02:13:40,040
That's a...

3399
02:13:40,440 --> 02:13:40,840
Yeah.

3400
02:13:40,920 --> 02:13:41,100
All right.

3401
02:13:41,140 --> 02:13:41,160
You're just...

3402
02:13:41,180 --> 02:13:45,740
I don't know if it's the map or... because like Stormpoint used to do that.

3403
02:13:45,840 --> 02:13:47,060
Stormpoint used to be like...

3404
02:13:47,600 --> 02:13:50,840
fucking poorly optimized because of the grass.

3405
02:13:52,260 --> 02:13:53,980
So like I can't tell.

3406
02:13:54,240 --> 02:13:56,620
I can't figure it out.

3407
02:13:56,620 --> 02:13:57,220
Maybe it's just Apex.

3408
02:13:57,700 --> 02:14:00,760
It's always... Apex has always been poorly optimized though.

3409
02:14:00,900 --> 02:14:01,020
Maybe it's just Apex.

3410
02:14:01,060 --> 02:14:02,280
It always has.

3411
02:14:02,520 --> 02:14:02,800
Yeah.

3412
02:14:04,520 --> 02:14:05,920
All right, come on, Tangent.

3413
02:14:05,940 --> 02:14:06,660
We need a win.

3414
02:14:10,160 --> 02:14:11,440
Try preload shaders.

3415
02:14:11,520 --> 02:14:11,900
Oh, okay.

3416
02:14:11,960 --> 02:14:12,860
I'll try that next game.

3417
02:14:13,540 --> 02:14:14,260
See if that works.

3418
02:14:14,680 --> 02:14:14,700
Oh yeah.

3419
02:14:14,700 --> 02:14:15,440
Why not that?

3420
02:14:15,560 --> 02:14:15,800
One on me.

3421
02:14:15,940 --> 02:14:16,160
One on me.

3422
02:14:16,160 --> 02:14:16,540
One on me.

3423
02:14:16,540 --> 02:14:17,540
Oh, one on him.

3424
02:14:22,100 --> 02:14:23,180
Oh, on me now.

3425
02:14:25,820 --> 02:14:26,180
Flash.

3426
02:14:26,800 --> 02:14:27,240
Knocked one.

3427
02:14:30,640 --> 02:14:32,480
I'm not thirsting him because of the thing.

3428
02:14:33,260 --> 02:14:35,600
Hey, they figured it out on Pierre.

3429
02:14:35,740 --> 02:14:35,920
Oh.

3430
02:14:39,420 --> 02:14:40,620
You're doing finish on him?

3431
02:14:40,780 --> 02:14:42,100
He's super low.

3432
02:14:43,520 --> 02:14:43,920
Okay.

3433
02:14:48,140 --> 02:14:48,680
On me.

3434
02:14:48,760 --> 02:14:48,820
On me.

3435
02:14:49,340 --> 02:14:49,740
Whoa!

3436
02:14:50,520 --> 02:14:50,920
Whoa.

3437
02:14:54,680 --> 02:14:55,480
All right.

3438
02:14:56,900 --> 02:14:57,700
They're respawning.

3439
02:14:58,580 --> 02:14:59,100
Are they?

3440
02:14:59,320 --> 02:14:59,720
Yeah.

3441
02:14:59,860 --> 02:15:00,160
They are?

3442
02:15:00,260 --> 02:15:00,560
Yeah.

3443
02:15:00,860 --> 02:15:01,920
I mean, they should.

3444
02:15:02,480 --> 02:15:03,300
He didn't like...

3445
02:15:03,300 --> 02:15:03,700
They should.

3446
02:15:04,560 --> 02:15:06,560
They should because we didn't kill the last guy.

3447
02:15:06,680 --> 02:15:07,700
Our guy didn't get his one.

3448
02:15:08,680 --> 02:15:10,480
We all got our ones except for him.

3449
02:15:11,960 --> 02:15:12,480
Shit.

3450
02:15:12,920 --> 02:15:13,440
Oh.

3451
02:15:13,900 --> 02:15:14,420
On...

3452
02:15:14,420 --> 02:15:15,220
Whoa.

3453
02:15:15,260 --> 02:15:15,420
What the...

3454
02:15:15,420 --> 02:15:15,700
Shhh!

3455
02:15:16,860 --> 02:15:17,380
Damn!

3456
02:15:17,400 --> 02:15:18,580
Oh, damn!

3457
02:15:20,740 --> 02:15:21,260
No skin.

3458
02:15:21,260 --> 02:15:22,300
We should not have thirsted him though.

3459
02:15:22,780 --> 02:15:23,300
Okay.

3460
02:15:25,020 --> 02:15:27,160
Sniping is like so easy.

3461
02:15:27,180 --> 02:15:27,500
Oh!

3462
02:15:27,560 --> 02:15:27,860
The highlights.

3463
02:15:28,060 --> 02:15:28,720
I swear.

3464
02:15:29,080 --> 02:15:30,060
Enemy shield.

3465
02:15:34,660 --> 02:15:35,460
He's flashed.

3466
02:15:35,480 --> 02:15:35,740
He's flashed.

3467
02:15:35,760 --> 02:15:36,040
He's one.

3468
02:15:36,100 --> 02:15:36,680
He's literally one.

3469
02:15:36,980 --> 02:15:37,560
On me.

3470
02:15:39,760 --> 02:15:40,620
Ah, come on.

3471
02:15:42,220 --> 02:15:43,040
Come on.

3472
02:15:43,080 --> 02:15:43,500
No!

3473
02:15:43,740 --> 02:15:44,800
They respawned it!

3474
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:47,040
They respawned!

3475
02:15:47,360 --> 02:15:48,520
I fucking hate you!

3476
02:15:50,360 --> 02:15:51,700
Get sad on!

3477
02:15:52,840 --> 02:15:53,080
What?

3478
02:15:54,800 --> 02:15:55,320
Okay.

3479
02:15:57,600 --> 02:16:00,220
Yeah, all my viewers are mad because I'm streaming at this hour.

3480
02:16:00,380 --> 02:16:00,820
No.

3481
02:16:01,100 --> 02:16:03,040
I mean, it's update.

3482
02:16:03,600 --> 02:16:04,320
What is it?

3483
02:16:04,380 --> 02:16:06,320
Auto reload shotguns with five allies.

3484
02:16:07,040 --> 02:16:07,560
Yeah.

3485
02:16:07,780 --> 02:16:08,420
They're over here.

3486
02:16:09,040 --> 02:16:09,920
By the way.

3487
02:16:09,960 --> 02:16:12,160
Update the game with like... within Southeast Asian time.

3488
02:16:12,480 --> 02:16:12,540
Oh my god!

3489
02:16:13,160 --> 02:16:13,860
Oh my god!

3490
02:16:14,340 --> 02:16:15,060
Those drops!

3491
02:16:15,300 --> 02:16:15,440
Oh!

3492
02:16:15,620 --> 02:16:15,920
Wait.

3493
02:16:16,020 --> 02:16:16,540
On me?

3494
02:16:16,980 --> 02:16:17,340
Wait.

3495
02:16:17,380 --> 02:16:17,640
What?

3496
02:16:22,730 --> 02:16:23,090
Wait.

3497
02:16:23,190 --> 02:16:23,310
No.

3498
02:16:23,410 --> 02:16:24,210
This is a different team.

3499
02:16:24,310 --> 02:16:25,570
This is a different team because they have a cos...

3500
02:16:27,050 --> 02:16:27,770
Oh shit!

3501
02:16:28,110 --> 02:16:28,470
Oh!

3502
02:16:28,750 --> 02:16:29,250
It's okay.

3503
02:16:29,330 --> 02:16:31,190
I'm gonna... not bleed out.

3504
02:16:32,250 --> 02:16:32,610
Okay.

3505
02:16:32,650 --> 02:16:33,690
I'm gonna bleed out.

3506
02:16:34,890 --> 02:16:35,370
That's right.

3507
02:16:35,490 --> 02:16:36,170
You don't get the kill.

3508
02:16:36,210 --> 02:16:36,710
I'm bled out.

3509
02:16:36,910 --> 02:16:37,550
I'm skinned.

3510
02:16:38,310 --> 02:16:39,030
I'm skinned.

3511
02:16:39,570 --> 02:16:39,930
Live!

3512
02:16:40,430 --> 02:16:42,250
Oh, I... I respawned.

3513
02:16:42,290 --> 02:16:42,610
Nice.

3514
02:16:42,970 --> 02:16:43,330
Wait.

3515
02:16:43,390 --> 02:16:44,290
Is it because you guys won the fight?

3516
02:16:44,970 --> 02:16:45,330
Yeah.

3517
02:16:45,330 --> 02:16:46,570
Oh my god.

3518
02:16:46,630 --> 02:16:47,510
I'm respawning next to me.

3519
02:16:47,570 --> 02:16:48,030
Somebody won.

3520
02:16:48,410 --> 02:16:50,430
I'm respawning to the person next to me.

3521
02:16:52,830 --> 02:16:53,270
Alright.

3522
02:16:53,290 --> 02:16:53,670
Here we go.

3523
02:16:56,010 --> 02:16:56,450
Weeeeee!

3524
02:17:01,540 --> 02:17:01,980
Weeeeee!

3525
02:17:01,980 --> 02:17:03,640
I always have PC.

3526
02:17:03,640 --> 02:17:04,580
They destroyed my drone.

3527
02:17:04,740 --> 02:17:05,700
What is this map design?

3528
02:17:05,780 --> 02:17:08,860
They just literally make a turn and a corner and it doesn't lead to anywhere.

3529
02:17:09,060 --> 02:17:10,200
It's too complex.

3530
02:17:12,580 --> 02:17:13,740
They don't need this.

3531
02:17:13,740 --> 02:17:14,300
They're up in the top building.

3532
02:17:14,540 --> 02:17:14,760
No.

3533
02:17:14,820 --> 02:17:16,600
They killed me before I could use my eyes.

3534
02:17:16,600 --> 02:17:17,080
What?

3535
02:17:18,120 --> 02:17:19,240
Those whores!

3536
02:17:21,900 --> 02:17:23,520
Are they still up top?

3537
02:17:24,300 --> 02:17:24,580
Yeah.

3538
02:17:24,700 --> 02:17:25,460
Kinda are.

3539
02:17:26,440 --> 02:17:28,100
I kinda shot them though.

3540
02:17:28,200 --> 02:17:29,300
There's always another team.

3541
02:17:29,840 --> 02:17:31,020
Is that a Kha'Zix?

3542
02:17:33,780 --> 02:17:35,120
Oh my god.

3543
02:17:35,560 --> 02:17:38,380
Is he

3544
02:17:41,570 --> 02:17:43,510
actually safe or is he fucking with us?

3545
02:17:45,170 --> 02:17:45,730
Oh!

3546
02:17:45,730 --> 02:17:46,070
Green!

3547
02:17:46,350 --> 02:17:46,870
Alright.

3548
02:17:46,950 --> 02:17:47,690
I'm going for it.

3549
02:17:53,360 --> 02:17:56,400
I don't like the fact that I can see.

3550
02:17:57,440 --> 02:17:58,180
I don't know.

3551
02:17:58,180 --> 02:17:58,880
It feels too easy.

3552
02:17:59,800 --> 02:18:00,240
Yeah.

3553
02:18:00,240 --> 02:18:01,360
It feels too easy.

3554
02:18:01,880 --> 02:18:01,900
Yeah.

3555
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:02,160
It really.

3556
02:18:02,460 --> 02:18:03,180
Like legit.

3557
02:18:03,260 --> 02:18:06,840
Use the sniper and I can see all the fucking targets with like one time scope.

3558
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:07,980
It's so fucking stupid.

3559
02:18:08,320 --> 02:18:08,720
Yeah.

3560
02:18:08,760 --> 02:18:09,620
That sounds stupid.

3561
02:18:09,900 --> 02:18:10,100
Alright.

3562
02:18:10,180 --> 02:18:10,560
Here we go.

3563
02:18:12,240 --> 02:18:12,680
Oh!

3564
02:18:12,800 --> 02:18:14,720
How did the stunner get worse?

3565
02:18:15,120 --> 02:18:16,020
How did he...

3566
02:18:16,780 --> 02:18:18,180
How did it get worse?

3567
02:18:18,440 --> 02:18:19,700
Are you on DX12?

3568
02:18:19,900 --> 02:18:20,740
Holy shit.

3569
02:18:20,980 --> 02:18:21,180
Cool.

3570
02:18:21,180 --> 02:18:21,960
I could be.

3571
02:18:22,700 --> 02:18:23,400
Oh yeah.

3572
02:18:23,460 --> 02:18:24,320
I destroyed a drone again.

3573
02:18:24,460 --> 02:18:26,080
Because the last time...

3574
02:18:26,080 --> 02:18:28,040
I could actually.

3575
02:18:28,580 --> 02:18:30,080
It's like so stupid.

3576
02:18:31,640 --> 02:18:32,140
Oh!

3577
02:18:32,180 --> 02:18:32,840
There's no scope.

3578
02:18:35,520 --> 02:18:36,500
Did someone drop?

3579
02:18:37,920 --> 02:18:38,420
Yeah.

3580
02:18:38,460 --> 02:18:38,820
I got him.

3581
02:18:39,020 --> 02:18:39,180
What the fuck is that?

3582
02:18:40,460 --> 02:18:40,960
Ow!

3583
02:18:43,160 --> 02:18:43,880
What the fuck?

3584
02:18:43,900 --> 02:18:44,620
Where did you come from?

3585
02:18:46,100 --> 02:18:47,020
Oh shit!

3586
02:18:47,160 --> 02:18:47,600
No!

3587
02:18:47,600 --> 02:18:48,020
What?

3588
02:18:48,100 --> 02:18:49,460
I was behind this wall!

3589
02:18:50,760 --> 02:18:51,260
Bitch!

3590
02:18:52,480 --> 02:18:52,880
Oh!

3591
02:18:52,880 --> 02:18:53,100
Here!

3592
02:18:53,180 --> 02:18:53,260
Here!

3593
02:18:53,380 --> 02:18:53,520
Here!

3594
02:18:53,520 --> 02:18:54,380
He should be low!

3595
02:18:54,460 --> 02:18:55,100
He should be low!

3596
02:18:55,180 --> 02:18:55,400
Yes!

3597
02:18:55,760 --> 02:18:56,620
Pull team down!

3598
02:18:57,480 --> 02:18:58,320
There's another team.

3599
02:18:58,920 --> 02:18:59,500
There's another team!

3600
02:18:59,760 --> 02:18:59,980
There!

3601
02:18:59,980 --> 02:19:00,140
It's okay.

3602
02:19:00,360 --> 02:19:00,960
Shield up!

3603
02:19:00,980 --> 02:19:01,320
It's okay.

3604
02:19:01,400 --> 02:19:03,340
I have 50 HP when I rez you.

3605
02:19:04,380 --> 02:19:04,940
It's okay.

3606
02:19:05,060 --> 02:19:05,280
Let's go.

3607
02:19:06,760 --> 02:19:07,500
Let's go, brother.

3608
02:19:07,740 --> 02:19:08,400
Let's go, brother.

3609
02:19:09,120 --> 02:19:09,660
Let's go!

3610
02:19:10,300 --> 02:19:11,380
There's another team here too!

3611
02:19:11,380 --> 02:19:12,440
I don't even have like a med kit or anything.

3612
02:19:13,740 --> 02:19:14,900
Next ring isn't close.

3613
02:19:15,920 --> 02:19:16,980
We're not even in the ring.

3614
02:19:17,060 --> 02:19:17,460
That's funny.

3615
02:19:17,960 --> 02:19:18,360
Yeah.

3616
02:19:18,420 --> 02:19:18,620
I know.

3617
02:19:18,720 --> 02:19:20,060
Does anyone have redeploy?

3618
02:19:20,120 --> 02:19:20,540
We're leaving.

3619
02:19:20,800 --> 02:19:21,500
Holy shit!

3620
02:19:21,540 --> 02:19:21,940
They're all dead.

3621
02:19:21,940 --> 02:19:22,040
Get on top!

3622
02:19:22,380 --> 02:19:22,940
Oh!

3623
02:19:24,820 --> 02:19:26,840
Increased tactical life that...

3624
02:19:26,840 --> 02:19:28,840
Oh, sorry, I was looking at my thing because I haven't played.

3625
02:19:32,020 --> 02:19:32,580
Okay.

3626
02:19:33,100 --> 02:19:34,220
Don't worry, brother.

3627
02:19:34,580 --> 02:19:35,840
Don't worry, brother!

3628
02:19:38,580 --> 02:19:39,140
Oh!

3629
02:19:44,160 --> 02:19:44,720
Oh!

3630
02:19:45,880 --> 02:19:46,440
Oh!

3631
02:19:47,620 --> 02:19:48,180
Oh!

3632
02:19:50,050 --> 02:19:50,610
Oh!

3633
02:19:50,610 --> 02:19:50,750
Oh, no!

3634
02:19:50,990 --> 02:19:51,510
Oh, no!

3635
02:19:52,210 --> 02:19:52,770
Don't...

3636
02:19:52,770 --> 02:19:53,050
Oh!

3637
02:20:01,450 --> 02:20:02,130
I'm okay.

3638
02:20:03,050 --> 02:20:04,690
I am kind of okay-ish.

3639
02:20:04,890 --> 02:20:05,630
I'm okay.

3640
02:20:06,210 --> 02:20:07,410
What just happened?

3641
02:20:07,550 --> 02:20:07,870
Yeah.

3642
02:20:09,950 --> 02:20:10,590
Somebody's rising.

3643
02:20:11,010 --> 02:20:11,670
Somebody's rising.

3644
02:20:12,570 --> 02:20:13,250
Somebody's rising.

3645
02:20:13,470 --> 02:20:18,260
Oh, it's that.

3646
02:20:22,140 --> 02:20:23,180
Get out of here.

3647
02:20:24,300 --> 02:20:25,560
I have no shields.

3648
02:20:25,600 --> 02:20:26,180
I have no shields.

3649
02:20:26,220 --> 02:20:27,300
We've been fighting for so long.

3650
02:20:31,740 --> 02:20:32,660
Don't go here!

3651
02:20:33,700 --> 02:20:35,540
There's a gang war here!

3652
02:20:37,080 --> 02:20:38,340
There's a gang war!

3653
02:20:40,460 --> 02:20:41,800
I'm safe, by the way.

3654
02:20:43,500 --> 02:20:44,200
I'm not.

3655
02:20:47,460 --> 02:20:47,960
Okay.

3656
02:20:49,060 --> 02:20:50,240
Oh, I have nothing.

3657
02:20:50,640 --> 02:20:51,480
Are they heals?

3658
02:20:51,820 --> 02:20:52,820
I need heals.

3659
02:20:53,180 --> 02:20:54,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3660
02:20:54,300 --> 02:20:56,180
Don't there is it, you fucking liar!

3661
02:20:56,300 --> 02:20:56,760
Here, here, here.

3662
02:20:56,760 --> 02:20:57,140
I took it.

3663
02:20:57,160 --> 02:20:57,480
I took it.

3664
02:20:57,580 --> 02:20:57,940
I took it.

3665
02:20:58,220 --> 02:20:59,800
Oh, there's a gold.

3666
02:20:59,960 --> 02:21:01,000
Yeah, I'm gonna get that.

3667
02:21:01,040 --> 02:21:01,360
Grab it.

3668
02:21:01,380 --> 02:21:02,040
It has a shield.

3669
02:21:02,660 --> 02:21:04,320
It has a shield.

3670
02:21:05,640 --> 02:21:06,680
We have to go.

3671
02:21:06,720 --> 02:21:07,460
We have to go.

3672
02:21:07,460 --> 02:21:08,080
We have to go.

3673
02:21:08,200 --> 02:21:08,660
We have to go.

3674
02:21:10,040 --> 02:21:11,180
Good thing I have that.

3675
02:21:11,480 --> 02:21:11,800
Fuck.

3676
02:21:13,040 --> 02:21:13,360
Okay.

3677
02:21:15,120 --> 02:21:15,600
Come on.

3678
02:21:16,120 --> 02:21:16,780
I'm heading over.

3679
02:21:17,780 --> 02:21:18,140
Let's go.

3680
02:21:19,140 --> 02:21:19,740
We leave.

3681
02:21:20,720 --> 02:21:22,040
We're at the wrong turf.

3682
02:21:22,160 --> 02:21:23,720
I'm at the wrong turf.

3683
02:21:24,200 --> 02:21:25,040
I'm sorry.

3684
02:21:25,840 --> 02:21:27,600
You can have this turf.

3685
02:21:31,200 --> 02:21:31,760
Alright.

3686
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:32,620
Wee-oo.

3687
02:21:34,980 --> 02:21:35,540
Alright.

3688
02:21:35,660 --> 02:21:37,720
I'm gonna try, see if I do like...

3689
02:21:38,640 --> 02:21:43,000
Try not to direct 12 and also preload my shaders.

3690
02:21:43,140 --> 02:21:43,740
Alright, guys.

3691
02:21:43,800 --> 02:21:48,880
Get ready to have those pre-written... have those launch command lines written for me.

3692
02:21:49,740 --> 02:21:50,200
What?

3693
02:21:50,340 --> 02:21:51,100
What did he say?

3694
02:21:53,100 --> 02:21:53,620
What?

3695
02:21:53,780 --> 02:21:54,360
I don't know.

3696
02:21:54,420 --> 02:21:54,980
He said something.

3697
02:21:55,220 --> 02:21:55,780
I left.

3698
02:21:56,680 --> 02:21:57,800
Fuck that shit.

3699
02:21:58,440 --> 02:21:59,500
Did I say anything?

3700
02:21:59,900 --> 02:22:01,060
No, our third.

3701
02:22:01,160 --> 02:22:02,340
Our third said something.

3702
02:22:02,680 --> 02:22:03,480
I don't know.

3703
02:22:03,620 --> 02:22:05,720
I'm muting the whole... I always mute people.

3704
02:22:05,720 --> 02:22:06,440
You're muting it?

3705
02:22:06,840 --> 02:22:09,200
I always mute people in this game because...

3706
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:10,820
Fuck people.

3707
02:22:11,020 --> 02:22:11,580
I got all on you.

3708
02:22:13,660 --> 02:22:14,600
Feelings don't matter.

3709
02:22:15,320 --> 02:22:15,840
Whoa.

3710
02:22:16,280 --> 02:22:16,880
Fuck your callouts.

3711
02:22:17,720 --> 02:22:18,240
Whoa.

3712
02:22:20,700 --> 02:22:22,000
Where are people, though?

3713
02:22:22,880 --> 02:22:23,320
Stop.

3714
02:22:24,380 --> 02:22:27,800
Where are people?

3715
02:22:27,960 --> 02:22:29,360
It's Southeast Asia, sir.

3716
02:22:30,200 --> 02:22:31,280
Where are they?

3717
02:22:31,300 --> 02:22:31,800
It's everywhere.

3718
02:22:32,300 --> 02:22:33,680
Everybody is so quiet.

3719
02:22:34,800 --> 02:22:36,700
Maybe I should make a coffee after this.

3720
02:22:38,540 --> 02:22:39,180
Oh, wait.

3721
02:22:39,200 --> 02:22:39,400
Nice.

3722
02:22:39,480 --> 02:22:41,400
I need thermites for my rampage.

3723
02:22:41,560 --> 02:22:42,640
Have I told you this before?

3724
02:22:42,880 --> 02:22:43,080
What?

3725
02:22:44,500 --> 02:22:46,740
It's been a month since I quit cigarettes.

3726
02:22:47,120 --> 02:22:47,740
Yeah, yeah.

3727
02:22:47,840 --> 02:22:48,100
We did.

3728
02:22:48,200 --> 02:22:49,660
We had a podcast, remember?

3729
02:22:50,320 --> 02:22:51,120
It's crazy.

3730
02:22:51,160 --> 02:22:51,620
How's it going?

3731
02:22:51,880 --> 02:22:53,820
Yeah, it's been a... I'm doing very well.

3732
02:22:54,020 --> 02:22:54,400
Holy shit.

3733
02:22:54,420 --> 02:22:55,880
You're not getting cravings?

3734
02:22:55,880 --> 02:22:56,580
That's really good.

3735
02:22:57,040 --> 02:22:57,140
No.

3736
02:22:57,520 --> 02:22:58,060
No.

3737
02:22:58,060 --> 02:22:58,340
Holy shit.

3738
02:22:58,340 --> 02:22:59,060
That's actually crazy good.

3739
02:22:59,120 --> 02:23:01,620
I'm very, very much better.

3740
02:23:01,840 --> 02:23:04,480
That's good health-wise and money-wise, too.

3741
02:23:05,220 --> 02:23:06,080
Hell, yeah.

3742
02:23:06,400 --> 02:23:10,680
I stopped smoking cigarettes for a month and I could buy an RTX 4080.

3743
02:23:10,840 --> 02:23:11,680
Holy shit.

3744
02:23:11,740 --> 02:23:11,780
Oh, shit.

3745
02:23:11,900 --> 02:23:12,320
Wait.

3746
02:23:12,580 --> 02:23:13,120
Really?

3747
02:23:13,580 --> 02:23:15,400
It's because of the...

3748
02:23:16,040 --> 02:23:17,240
Oh, my God.

3749
02:23:17,320 --> 02:23:22,520
You could have fucking bought better PC upgrades if you fucking stopped earlier.

3750
02:23:23,800 --> 02:23:25,700
That's actually crazy.

3751
02:23:27,200 --> 02:23:28,520
That's fucked up.

3752
02:23:28,600 --> 02:23:30,280
That's actually fucked up.

3753
02:23:30,320 --> 02:23:30,420
No, I'm kidding.

3754
02:23:30,600 --> 02:23:30,760
I'm kidding.

3755
02:23:31,360 --> 02:23:32,580
Cigarettes here are cheap.

3756
02:23:33,540 --> 02:23:34,600
Okay, I'm gonna say it.

3757
02:23:34,600 --> 02:23:35,760
Thankfully, it is cheap.

3758
02:23:36,520 --> 02:23:38,040
Where is the fight?

3759
02:23:39,140 --> 02:23:40,780
Tenjin, go find them.

3760
02:23:40,820 --> 02:23:41,540
Use your drone.

3761
02:23:41,740 --> 02:23:42,680
It's right there.

3762
02:23:43,080 --> 02:23:44,880
Well, I can't see it.

3763
02:23:44,940 --> 02:23:45,300
I'm sniffing.

3764
02:23:45,400 --> 02:23:47,460
I can't see it, though.

3765
02:23:47,940 --> 02:23:50,060
Can you assume that I can see that?

3766
02:23:50,360 --> 02:23:54,200
You know you can right-click any ES and just see them?

3767
02:23:54,240 --> 02:23:54,700
No, no.

3768
02:23:54,740 --> 02:23:56,100
I don't know what you're talking about.

3769
02:23:56,300 --> 02:23:57,720
I'm playing Gibraltar.

3770
02:23:58,100 --> 02:24:00,840
Oh, my God.

3771
02:24:00,920 --> 02:24:03,280
Our crypto's not doing his job.

3772
02:24:04,820 --> 02:24:05,340
There.

3773
02:24:05,360 --> 02:24:06,800
I put drone in three.

3774
02:24:06,880 --> 02:24:07,940
They will not see this.

3775
02:24:07,940 --> 02:24:09,160
Oh, my God.

3776
02:24:09,160 --> 02:24:10,080
How are they supposed to see this?

3777
02:24:10,340 --> 02:24:12,940
Our crypto's not doing his job.

3778
02:24:19,840 --> 02:24:20,220
Oh.

3779
02:24:23,100 --> 02:24:24,080
Oh, shit.

3780
02:24:25,820 --> 02:24:28,940
I threw it against my Gibi.

3781
02:24:30,760 --> 02:24:33,680
I threw it against my Gibi.

3782
02:24:37,520 --> 02:24:38,660
I fucked up.

3783
02:24:41,220 --> 02:24:42,420
I don't want to be here.

3784
02:24:42,500 --> 02:24:43,900
I don't want to fight in the zone again.

3785
02:24:45,240 --> 02:24:46,240
I'm fucking with you.

3786
02:24:46,280 --> 02:24:47,080
I don't want to fight in the zone.

3787
02:24:47,160 --> 02:24:48,740
I don't even want to have a med kit.

3788
02:24:49,840 --> 02:24:50,720
Here, I have a medkit.

3789
02:24:51,080 --> 02:24:53,140
I don't think you can heal in time.

3790
02:24:55,110 --> 02:24:56,860
Oh, enemy is respawning nearby.

3791
02:25:02,880 --> 02:25:05,540
What the fuck is wrong with him?!

3792
02:25:05,540 --> 02:25:06,620
He's crying!

3793
02:25:07,180 --> 02:25:08,140
Somebody help him!

3794
02:25:09,700 --> 02:25:10,560
Is he crying?

3795
02:25:10,840 --> 02:25:11,420
What is he saying?

3796
02:25:11,660 --> 02:25:12,500
He's like, help!

3797
02:25:12,960 --> 02:25:13,960
Help me!

3798
02:25:14,600 --> 02:25:15,720
What the fuck?

3799
02:25:15,980 --> 02:25:18,420
It's literally like 5 am.

3800
02:25:18,580 --> 02:25:19,660
Why are you crying in the morning?

3801
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:20,200
Here, here, here.

3802
02:25:20,280 --> 02:25:21,020
You dropped a medkit.

3803
02:25:22,820 --> 02:25:23,800
Oh, gee!

3804
02:25:24,040 --> 02:25:26,080
Thank you for a medkit.

3805
02:25:26,160 --> 02:25:28,760
I could have used that like, I don't know, five syringes ago?

3806
02:25:29,320 --> 02:25:30,520
Yeah, you're welcome.

3807
02:25:34,120 --> 02:25:35,060
That's on you!

3808
02:25:35,440 --> 02:25:36,840
That's literally on you!

3809
02:25:42,090 --> 02:25:43,050
Got you.

3810
02:25:43,350 --> 02:25:44,370
I got you!

3811
02:25:44,770 --> 02:25:45,770
I got you, bro!

3812
02:25:47,370 --> 02:25:48,090
Hell yeah!

3813
02:25:48,230 --> 02:25:48,950
Does he have anything?

3814
02:25:49,450 --> 02:25:50,330
I'm snared.

3815
02:25:50,370 --> 02:25:51,450
I'm fucking... I'm snared.

3816
02:25:53,150 --> 02:25:55,410
Now you can use that medkit I gave you!

3817
02:25:56,750 --> 02:25:57,190
Yeah!

3818
02:25:57,190 --> 02:25:59,070
Thank you for the medkit, doki!

3819
02:25:59,250 --> 02:25:59,470
Yeah, see, you're welcome!

3820
02:25:59,470 --> 02:25:59,710
You're welcome.

3821
02:26:00,570 --> 02:26:01,730
Don't worry, I got you.

3822
02:26:01,810 --> 02:26:02,690
I told you I got you!

3823
02:26:05,350 --> 02:26:06,790
Oh my god, he's so low.

3824
02:26:07,070 --> 02:26:08,570
There's an octane right there that's low.

3825
02:26:12,750 --> 02:26:16,190
This like, double shield is crazy though, not gonna lie.

3826
02:26:17,850 --> 02:26:19,310
Hey, I need your crypto thingy.

3827
02:26:20,650 --> 02:26:21,190
Hold up.

3828
02:26:23,170 --> 02:26:23,870
He's right there.

3829
02:26:27,010 --> 02:26:27,810
I knocked one.

3830
02:26:28,390 --> 02:26:29,050
Another guy.

3831
02:26:29,350 --> 02:26:30,150
Three guys here on me.

3832
02:26:30,170 --> 02:26:33,130
I'm shooting at my throne, you... BTs!

3833
02:26:33,270 --> 02:26:34,730
On me, on me, on me, on me.

3834
02:26:37,890 --> 02:26:40,130
That guy's one that... Oh, you're not there!

3835
02:26:40,470 --> 02:26:41,490
He's so low though.

3836
02:26:43,830 --> 02:26:45,950
Did you get that, uh, Cal... uh, conduit?

3837
02:26:46,430 --> 02:26:48,650
I got the fucking... what's his name?

3838
02:26:49,730 --> 02:26:50,810
Yeah, you got the conduit.

3839
02:26:52,390 --> 02:26:52,850
Oh!

3840
02:26:52,850 --> 02:26:53,910
I'm recharging!

3841
02:26:54,070 --> 02:26:54,430
He's rising!

3842
02:26:54,650 --> 02:26:55,550
He's rising!

3843
02:26:56,110 --> 02:26:57,490
I can't see smoke!

3844
02:26:57,610 --> 02:26:58,890
I can't see smoke!

3845
02:26:59,510 --> 02:27:00,850
I'm going to die!

3846
02:27:01,790 --> 02:27:03,550
Okay, you guys, guys, guys, bleed out.

3847
02:27:03,650 --> 02:27:04,150
You guys bleed out.

3848
02:27:04,190 --> 02:27:04,690
You guys bleed out.

3849
02:27:04,770 --> 02:27:05,170
I'm dead.

3850
02:27:05,490 --> 02:27:06,550
You guys bleed out.

3851
02:27:09,330 --> 02:27:09,970
Bleed out.

3852
02:27:10,030 --> 02:27:10,570
I can live.

3853
02:27:10,750 --> 02:27:11,350
I can live.

3854
02:27:12,050 --> 02:27:12,790
Maybe not.

3855
02:27:12,850 --> 02:27:13,370
Maybe not.

3856
02:27:13,430 --> 02:27:13,990
I can live.

3857
02:27:14,110 --> 02:27:15,050
Maybe... maybe not.

3858
02:27:15,050 --> 02:27:16,550
Maybe... maybe I can live.

3859
02:27:16,630 --> 02:27:17,130
I can live.

3860
02:27:17,610 --> 02:27:18,930
But trust the process.

3861
02:27:19,230 --> 02:27:19,990
Trust the process.

3862
02:27:20,370 --> 02:27:22,450
I trust the process, yes, but like...

3863
02:27:22,450 --> 02:27:23,350
Just trust the process.

3864
02:27:24,090 --> 02:27:26,770
If you don't trust the process, then you'll just die.

3865
02:27:26,790 --> 02:27:28,550
But like, by the time ring closes...

3866
02:27:28,550 --> 02:27:29,310
Trust the process.

3867
02:27:29,410 --> 02:27:29,990
See, I'm alive.

3868
02:27:30,930 --> 02:27:31,950
Sure, sure, sure, sure.

3869
02:27:32,250 --> 02:27:33,550
Told you to trust the process.

3870
02:27:33,910 --> 02:27:35,970
I don't think our guy will, like, spawn in.

3871
02:27:36,330 --> 02:27:37,010
Yeah, he will.

3872
02:27:38,170 --> 02:27:38,630
See?

3873
02:27:39,350 --> 02:27:39,810
See?

3874
02:27:39,870 --> 02:27:40,670
Trust the process.

3875
02:27:41,470 --> 02:27:43,590
Where I'm at has no body.

3876
02:27:43,590 --> 02:27:44,490
Okay, final death, huh?

3877
02:27:45,810 --> 02:27:46,210
See?

3878
02:27:46,370 --> 02:27:46,690
Alright.

3879
02:27:47,750 --> 02:27:49,710
I have no ammo by the way.

3880
02:27:50,050 --> 02:27:50,830
I can...

3881
02:27:51,390 --> 02:27:51,950
Wait, wait.

3882
02:27:51,990 --> 02:27:52,730
Where are you?

3883
02:27:52,790 --> 02:27:55,230
Okay, they might land on me because...

3884
02:27:55,230 --> 02:27:56,550
I'm literally landed on you.

3885
02:27:56,590 --> 02:27:56,990
Oh, okay.

3886
02:27:57,110 --> 02:27:57,330
Yeah, yeah.

3887
02:27:57,770 --> 02:27:58,430
Thank God.

3888
02:27:58,510 --> 02:27:58,950
I was gonna say.

3889
02:28:01,370 --> 02:28:02,090
Last life.

3890
02:28:03,490 --> 02:28:04,490
Yeah, last life.

3891
02:28:05,830 --> 02:28:07,010
I'm gonna get in the bush.

3892
02:28:08,270 --> 02:28:09,010
I'm in the bush.

3893
02:28:10,490 --> 02:28:11,590
Alright, he's coming back.

3894
02:28:11,630 --> 02:28:12,090
You hear that?

3895
02:28:12,150 --> 02:28:12,670
He's coming back.

3896
02:28:13,510 --> 02:28:14,250
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3897
02:28:14,250 --> 02:28:15,370
He's saying anything?

3898
02:28:15,490 --> 02:28:15,650
What the fuck?

3899
02:28:15,690 --> 02:28:17,190
Yeah, he's like, I'm coming back.

3900
02:28:17,370 --> 02:28:17,870
Yeah!

3901
02:28:20,670 --> 02:28:21,770
Is it a kid?

3902
02:28:22,090 --> 02:28:23,830
No, it's a man.

3903
02:28:27,710 --> 02:28:29,330
That guy was so low.

3904
02:28:29,810 --> 02:28:32,510
Oh my God, he's giving ASMR right now.

3905
02:28:37,610 --> 02:28:39,270
He's literally giving ASMR.

3906
02:28:40,310 --> 02:28:41,250
Free ASMR.

3907
02:28:41,290 --> 02:28:42,290
Where are you guys shooting?

3908
02:28:42,410 --> 02:28:43,130
Oh, he's over there?

3909
02:28:43,450 --> 02:28:43,850
Yeah.

3910
02:28:45,150 --> 02:28:45,650
Alright.

3911
02:28:45,650 --> 02:28:46,870
If you say so.

3912
02:28:46,890 --> 02:28:47,170
I'll put the drone below.

3913
02:28:47,170 --> 02:28:48,190
I'm gonna do something stupid.

3914
02:28:51,670 --> 02:28:52,650
On me, on me, on me.

3915
02:28:53,230 --> 02:28:54,170
There's multiple of them.

3916
02:28:55,490 --> 02:28:56,610
There's a whole squad right there.

3917
02:28:59,250 --> 02:29:00,050
He's going away.

3918
02:29:01,270 --> 02:29:01,890
On me.

3919
02:29:06,370 --> 02:29:07,430
What are you doing?

3920
02:29:07,670 --> 02:29:08,070
Oh shit!

3921
02:29:10,250 --> 02:29:11,110
That's last life.

3922
02:29:11,150 --> 02:29:11,990
We have to kill him.

3923
02:29:12,270 --> 02:29:13,050
Did you thirst him?

3924
02:29:13,250 --> 02:29:13,450
Yeah.

3925
02:29:13,950 --> 02:29:14,350
Nice.

3926
02:29:14,350 --> 02:29:15,450
Give me my shields and recharge.

3927
02:29:16,350 --> 02:29:17,550
It's last life, Dejan.

3928
02:29:17,590 --> 02:29:18,210
You can't die!

3929
02:29:19,090 --> 02:29:20,310
I know I can't.

3930
02:29:20,310 --> 02:29:21,210
I'm not allowed to.

3931
02:29:21,910 --> 02:29:23,470
Legally, I'm not allowed to die yet.

3932
02:29:24,370 --> 02:29:24,790
Whoa.

3933
02:29:25,390 --> 02:29:26,570
Okay, I'm gonna steal his stuff.

3934
02:29:27,430 --> 02:29:28,790
Oh, he has the Hammond point.

3935
02:29:28,830 --> 02:29:29,490
I needed that too.

3936
02:29:30,410 --> 02:29:32,510
I mean, we're technically in zone.

3937
02:29:36,820 --> 02:29:38,320
I have like one...

3938
02:29:40,140 --> 02:29:44,060
I literally have one, uh, thermite left, so I don't want to...

3939
02:29:44,060 --> 02:29:44,380
Give me a sec.

3940
02:29:44,380 --> 02:29:45,700
Yeah, where are they?

3941
02:29:45,960 --> 02:29:46,500
What is your...

3942
02:29:46,500 --> 02:29:46,820
Cover me.

3943
02:29:46,960 --> 02:29:47,860
Cover my ass!

3944
02:29:48,060 --> 02:29:50,840
You don't have... What you didn't do off the grid?

3945
02:29:51,300 --> 02:29:52,780
Why didn't you do off the grid?

3946
02:29:53,420 --> 02:29:54,100
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

3947
02:29:56,480 --> 02:29:57,640
Oh my god.

3948
02:29:57,660 --> 02:30:00,340
Okay, they have high ground so I don't know.

3949
02:30:00,680 --> 02:30:02,800
That shit will scan thrice.

3950
02:30:03,460 --> 02:30:05,320
For 15 seconds I think.

3951
02:30:05,660 --> 02:30:06,140
Oh my god.

3952
02:30:06,160 --> 02:30:06,900
I don't know.

3953
02:30:07,860 --> 02:30:10,180
That is actually nice.

3954
02:30:10,460 --> 02:30:11,720
He's like, oh my god.

3955
02:30:12,760 --> 02:30:13,640
No, shit!

3956
02:30:14,060 --> 02:30:15,480
And this is last life.

3957
02:30:16,780 --> 02:30:17,220
Yeah.

3958
02:30:17,720 --> 02:30:18,320
I know.

3959
02:30:18,440 --> 02:30:20,060
I'm not valuing my life at all, huh?

3960
02:30:20,480 --> 02:30:21,780
Yeah, I was gonna say.

3961
02:30:22,640 --> 02:30:23,380
Wait, what?

3962
02:30:23,700 --> 02:30:24,480
Are they here?

3963
02:30:25,680 --> 02:30:27,000
Oh no, they're just... They're above.

3964
02:30:28,840 --> 02:30:31,100
I can ult, but I'm gonna wait until the last second.

3965
02:30:33,980 --> 02:30:35,200
She could ult.

3966
02:30:35,380 --> 02:30:35,980
I could.

3967
02:30:36,080 --> 02:30:36,660
She just chose not to.

3968
02:30:36,740 --> 02:30:38,080
Yeah, I just chose not to.

3969
02:30:38,880 --> 02:30:40,380
She just chose not to.

3970
02:30:40,500 --> 02:30:40,720
Yeah!

3971
02:30:41,720 --> 02:30:42,100
I can ult then.

3972
02:30:42,200 --> 02:30:45,220
Wait, we should EMP the moment I...

3973
02:30:45,720 --> 02:30:47,080
Oh no, no, they're inside.

3974
02:30:47,220 --> 02:30:48,920
They're all inside.

3975
02:30:49,380 --> 02:30:50,640
Yeah, they're just gonna wait I feel like.

3976
02:30:50,680 --> 02:30:51,760
They're not gonna come out.

3977
02:30:53,460 --> 02:30:55,660
Like, let's just play these stairs or...

3978
02:30:55,660 --> 02:30:56,420
I don't know.

3979
02:30:56,500 --> 02:30:57,720
Here, this is closest.

3980
02:30:58,540 --> 02:31:01,560
This is literally the closest to the final ring.

3981
02:31:01,620 --> 02:31:02,980
Okay, this is the safest location I'd be right now.

3982
02:31:03,180 --> 02:31:03,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3983
02:31:05,700 --> 02:31:06,780
Why don't you crouch?

3984
02:31:08,280 --> 02:31:08,680
No.

3985
02:31:09,280 --> 02:31:10,280
I stand proud.

3986
02:31:11,720 --> 02:31:13,700
Let's see if I can get cr... No, I don't wanna...

3987
02:31:13,700 --> 02:31:14,660
Whoa!

3988
02:31:15,420 --> 02:31:17,480
This guy ain't valiant, he's like it.

3989
02:31:19,520 --> 02:31:20,000
Okay.

3990
02:31:20,940 --> 02:31:22,740
It's now or nothing, man.

3991
02:31:22,920 --> 02:31:23,240
Alright.

3992
02:31:26,640 --> 02:31:27,460
Alright, I'm doing it.

3993
02:31:30,320 --> 02:31:30,800
Alright.

3994
02:31:31,280 --> 02:31:32,060
All scanned.

3995
02:31:33,100 --> 02:31:34,020
Oh, they're inside.

3996
02:31:34,460 --> 02:31:34,940
Alright.

3997
02:31:35,760 --> 02:31:36,380
That's funny.

3998
02:31:37,560 --> 02:31:38,620
Oh, that's awkward.

3999
02:31:38,620 --> 02:31:38,840
Ow.

4000
02:31:40,320 --> 02:31:41,840
That's kinda... kinda is.

4001
02:31:42,440 --> 02:31:43,200
That's awkward.

4002
02:31:44,780 --> 02:31:45,280
Alright.

4003
02:31:46,080 --> 02:31:47,400
I think our guy got him.

4004
02:31:47,540 --> 02:31:48,220
Oh, shit.

4005
02:31:48,320 --> 02:31:49,660
I think I got... I think we win.

4006
02:31:50,020 --> 02:31:50,520
Nope.

4007
02:31:50,700 --> 02:31:51,720
I'm just gonna stay here.

4008
02:31:52,120 --> 02:31:52,480
No scope.

4009
02:31:52,580 --> 02:31:52,860
Boom!

4010
02:31:53,160 --> 02:31:53,420
Alright.

4011
02:31:53,500 --> 02:31:53,760
Yay!

4012
02:31:56,000 --> 02:31:56,500
Yippee!

4013
02:31:58,200 --> 02:31:59,560
I won by...

4014
02:31:59,560 --> 02:32:02,380
doing absolutely nothing at the end.

4015
02:32:02,700 --> 02:32:03,740
That's all that matters.

4016
02:32:04,220 --> 02:32:06,160
I didn't do anything at all, so...

4017
02:32:07,720 --> 02:32:08,680
I just stayed outside.

4018
02:32:08,680 --> 02:32:10,420
I didn't even hit a single shot in that room.

4019
02:32:10,800 --> 02:32:11,660
I mean...

4020
02:32:11,660 --> 02:32:13,660
We just didn't even come out.

4021
02:32:13,880 --> 02:32:15,840
I wasn't gonna push in.

4022
02:32:16,400 --> 02:32:16,760
Like...

4023
02:32:18,500 --> 02:32:19,680
He's like, Yippee!

4024
02:32:20,100 --> 02:32:21,320
Oh my god!

4025
02:32:21,760 --> 02:32:22,880
Our guy was pretty good.

4026
02:32:23,620 --> 02:32:24,100
Yeah.

4027
02:32:25,340 --> 02:32:27,040
Okay, Yippee has been really fun.

4028
02:32:27,100 --> 02:32:29,760
I'm gonna do the new command line and see if that fixes it.

4029
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:30,600
Alright, guys.

4030
02:32:30,760 --> 02:32:32,180
Give me the new command line.

4031
02:32:32,400 --> 02:32:33,760
And then I'm gonna fix that.

4032
02:32:36,160 --> 02:32:36,360
Alright.

4033
02:32:37,720 --> 02:32:39,040
Maybe I should make coffee.

4034
02:32:40,180 --> 02:32:41,820
How long... How long are you gonna play?

4035
02:32:43,040 --> 02:32:43,480
Alright.

4036
02:32:43,620 --> 02:32:44,380
I can play very long.

4037
02:32:46,020 --> 02:32:46,900
Like, legit.

4038
02:32:47,240 --> 02:32:48,180
I woke up at like...

4039
02:32:48,680 --> 02:32:49,120
6pm.

4040
02:32:49,320 --> 02:32:51,920
I can play like 30 more minutes.

4041
02:32:51,960 --> 02:32:53,220
Because I actually have to record something.

4042
02:32:54,060 --> 02:32:55,900
You have to record something?

4043
02:32:56,260 --> 02:32:56,860
I have to record!

4044
02:32:57,380 --> 02:32:57,820
Yeah!

4045
02:32:58,140 --> 02:32:58,700
Oh my god.

4046
02:32:58,720 --> 02:33:00,300
No way you have to record something.

4047
02:33:00,340 --> 02:33:00,780
Yeah!

4048
02:33:00,800 --> 02:33:01,540
I have to record something.

4049
02:33:01,560 --> 02:33:03,760
I have an Annie Rebel concert.

4050
02:33:04,160 --> 02:33:05,040
Oh yeah, you're a con.

4051
02:33:05,040 --> 02:33:05,280
Yeah.

4052
02:33:05,300 --> 02:33:05,420
Yeah.

4053
02:33:05,520 --> 02:33:05,620
Yeah.

4054
02:33:06,160 --> 02:33:07,080
You have to record something for it.

4055
02:33:07,160 --> 02:33:07,940
Best of luck on that.

4056
02:33:08,260 --> 02:33:08,700
Huh?

4057
02:33:10,280 --> 02:33:10,940
What did you say?

4058
02:33:11,760 --> 02:33:12,920
Best of luck on that.

4059
02:33:12,920 --> 02:33:13,540
Oh, thank you.

4060
02:33:13,700 --> 02:33:14,680
Alright, guys.

4061
02:33:14,760 --> 02:33:15,820
What's the command line?

4062
02:33:15,900 --> 02:33:16,660
That I have to do?

4063
02:33:16,740 --> 02:33:17,420
The launch option.

4064
02:33:17,900 --> 02:33:18,260
Alright.

4065
02:33:18,300 --> 02:33:19,940
Add the preload?

4066
02:33:20,040 --> 02:33:20,280
Okay.

4067
02:33:20,420 --> 02:33:20,840
This.

4068
02:33:20,980 --> 02:33:21,620
I'll copy that.

4069
02:33:21,900 --> 02:33:24,700
What about the... I wanna make sure I'm not playing on 12.

4070
02:33:25,060 --> 02:33:25,740
DirectX 12.

4071
02:33:26,080 --> 02:33:27,060
How do I...

4072
02:33:27,660 --> 02:33:31,820
How do I force it to be DirectX 11 instead?

4073
02:33:33,920 --> 02:33:37,200
Why am I getting 300 pings and 300 pings?

4074
02:33:37,200 --> 02:33:38,760
Why are you getting 300 pings?

4075
02:33:39,260 --> 02:33:42,520
I don't know because... No, it's not pre-recorded but there's a...

4076
02:33:43,060 --> 02:33:45,980
Guys, there's something there, remember?

4077
02:33:46,620 --> 02:33:47,980
Hor, hor, hor, hor, hor.

4078
02:33:48,360 --> 02:33:48,840
Hahahaha!

4079
02:33:50,560 --> 02:33:51,040
Hahahaha!

4080
02:33:51,120 --> 02:33:51,300
Hahahaha!

4081
02:33:53,560 --> 02:33:55,900
You made me choke me on my word, you bitch!

4082
02:33:57,160 --> 02:33:58,460
You trying to kill me?

4083
02:33:59,060 --> 02:33:59,920
You fu...

4084
02:34:00,580 --> 02:34:01,060
Hahahaha!

4085
02:34:01,280 --> 02:34:01,760
Hahahaha!

4086
02:34:04,780 --> 02:34:05,260
Goddamn!

4087
02:34:06,160 --> 02:34:06,980
The fuck was that?

4088
02:34:07,180 --> 02:34:08,380
That was so random.

4089
02:34:08,520 --> 02:34:09,480
That was like, out of...

4090
02:34:09,480 --> 02:34:10,500
Hor, hor, hor, hor.

4091
02:34:10,500 --> 02:34:11,340
That was so random!

4092
02:34:13,800 --> 02:34:16,080
That was so fucking random.

4093
02:34:16,220 --> 02:34:16,920
That was so fucking random.

4094
02:34:16,920 --> 02:34:17,560
What the fuck was that?

4095
02:34:17,560 --> 02:34:19,340
Guys, guys, guys.

4096
02:34:19,460 --> 02:34:22,700
What's the command line to force DirectX 11?

4097
02:34:22,920 --> 02:34:23,360
Guys!

4098
02:34:23,760 --> 02:34:25,280
I need it.

4099
02:34:26,140 --> 02:34:26,700
Okay.

4100
02:34:27,280 --> 02:34:28,440
Okay, I have this.

4101
02:34:28,780 --> 02:34:30,420
What else do I need to add in there?

4102
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:35,920
I wanna fix this before I take it to the PC doctor again.

4103
02:34:36,160 --> 02:34:36,900
I don't know.

4104
02:34:39,240 --> 02:34:42,220
Just straight up say, Hor, hor, hor, hor.

4105
02:34:42,220 --> 02:34:44,760
Doesn't even fucking elaborate what it's all about.

4106
02:34:45,060 --> 02:34:46,540
Doesn't even fucking elaborate what it's all about.

4107
02:34:46,540 --> 02:34:47,500
Like, what the fuck?

4108
02:34:49,000 --> 02:34:51,520
There's no need for elaboration!

4109
02:34:51,760 --> 02:34:52,960
There's no need for elaboration!

4110
02:34:52,960 --> 02:34:55,520
Also, like, I can tell that...

4111
02:34:55,520 --> 02:34:58,140
I can tell when I'm fighting a controller player because...

4112
02:34:58,140 --> 02:34:59,460
Holy shit.

4113
02:34:59,540 --> 02:35:01,860
That nerve is actually hitting them so hard.

4114
02:35:02,260 --> 02:35:05,360
Like, they can't actually aim now.

4115
02:35:05,440 --> 02:35:06,140
It's actually coming.

4116
02:35:06,160 --> 02:35:06,660
It's actually crazy.

4117
02:35:08,060 --> 02:35:09,420
It's actually crazy.

4118
02:35:09,580 --> 02:35:11,000
They can't aim anymore.

4119
02:35:11,200 --> 02:35:11,860
I love it.

4120
02:35:12,560 --> 02:35:14,940
Because, like, it's fucking with their muscle memory.

4121
02:35:16,460 --> 02:35:18,940
It's actually fucking with their muscle memory.

4122
02:35:19,080 --> 02:35:19,540
And I can tell.

4123
02:35:22,440 --> 02:35:24,220
Until they get used to it.

4124
02:35:24,400 --> 02:35:27,500
But, like, this is the time to take advantage of...

4125
02:35:28,260 --> 02:35:29,720
of their lack of muscle memory.

4126
02:35:31,100 --> 02:35:31,580
Alright.

4127
02:35:32,660 --> 02:35:33,380
Let's see.

4128
02:35:33,380 --> 02:35:34,920
Let's see if it works now.

4129
02:35:35,200 --> 02:35:36,340
Waiting for game.

4130
02:35:37,380 --> 02:35:37,940
Alright.

4131
02:35:38,740 --> 02:35:40,660
At best, if I'll ever...

4132
02:35:40,660 --> 02:35:43,080
At best, I'll just get more RAM installed.

4133
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:47,300
Because, like, my old PC had, like, max RAM.

4134
02:35:48,740 --> 02:35:49,300
64?

4135
02:35:49,660 --> 02:35:50,120
Yeah.

4136
02:35:50,500 --> 02:35:51,560
That's not the max.

4137
02:35:51,840 --> 02:35:52,780
Wait, that's not?

4138
02:35:52,980 --> 02:35:53,820
What's the max?

4139
02:35:53,860 --> 02:35:54,300
120.

4140
02:35:54,720 --> 02:35:55,800
Holy shit.

4141
02:35:56,080 --> 02:35:58,340
Wait, what?

4142
02:35:58,440 --> 02:35:59,980
Unable to connect to EA server?

4143
02:36:00,600 --> 02:36:01,520
What the fuck?

4144
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:02,940
Holy shit.

4145
02:36:03,380 --> 02:36:05,380
Is the server down or is it just the command line that I put out?

4146
02:36:05,620 --> 02:36:06,540
I don't know.

4147
02:36:06,960 --> 02:36:08,000
I can't tell!

4148
02:36:11,280 --> 02:36:13,380
I can't tell you that as well.

4149
02:36:13,580 --> 02:36:15,020
Because... I can't tell!

4150
02:36:16,120 --> 02:36:18,560
I can't tell if it's my command line!

4151
02:36:19,680 --> 02:36:19,700
Everything has been blocked here.

4152
02:36:21,220 --> 02:36:23,240
This is unable to connect!

4153
02:36:23,760 --> 02:36:25,580
It could be my command line that I put down.

4154
02:36:26,520 --> 02:36:27,740
I won't be surprised.

4155
02:36:28,340 --> 02:36:29,420
It's always me.

4156
02:36:29,680 --> 02:36:31,180
It's always me.

4157
02:36:32,380 --> 02:36:33,180
Alright, guys.

4158
02:36:33,380 --> 02:36:34,800
Guys, what do I change?

4159
02:36:35,020 --> 02:36:35,920
I have this!

4160
02:36:36,880 --> 02:36:37,800
Alright, restart?

4161
02:36:38,100 --> 02:36:38,780
Okay, I'm gonna start.

4162
02:36:39,580 --> 02:36:40,220
I'll restart.

4163
02:36:43,460 --> 02:36:46,140
Hoor, hoor, hoor, hoor, hoor, hoor, hoor, hoor!

4164
02:36:46,460 --> 02:36:46,920
Hoor, hoor, hoor, hoor, hoor, hoor, hoor!

4165
02:36:47,420 --> 02:36:51,960
Did you see, like, people were, like, debating about what FNAF was gonna be collabing with?

4166
02:36:52,840 --> 02:36:57,700
Everybody was like, if it's not Fortnite, I'm gonna be so fucking mad.

4167
02:36:59,080 --> 02:37:00,060
It's dead by daylight.

4168
02:37:00,060 --> 02:37:01,440
And then it's dead by then.

4169
02:37:11,700 --> 02:37:12,220
Alright,

4170
02:37:17,660 --> 02:37:18,260
here we go.

4171
02:37:19,260 --> 02:37:21,940
If the restart doesn't work...

4172
02:37:21,940 --> 02:37:23,560
Oh my god, unable to connect.

4173
02:37:23,820 --> 02:37:26,220
Wait, make sure Steam is...

4174
02:37:26,220 --> 02:37:27,240
Is Steam online?

4175
02:37:31,360 --> 02:37:32,980
Wait, Steam isn't online.

4176
02:37:34,340 --> 02:37:34,940
Wait.

4177
02:37:34,940 --> 02:37:37,000
Oh my god, when is Steam coming back?

4178
02:37:37,240 --> 02:37:39,820
Why is everything never going to work?

4179
02:37:40,220 --> 02:37:42,160
Why am I so unlucky?

4180
02:37:46,900 --> 02:37:49,900
When does Steam come back?

4181
02:37:50,160 --> 02:37:52,680
When does Steam come back?

4182
02:37:53,360 --> 02:37:55,320
This is why I don't use Steam.

4183
02:37:55,340 --> 02:37:57,540
Why am I so unlucky?

4184
02:38:02,660 --> 02:38:05,060
I don't understand!

4185
02:38:08,820 --> 02:38:10,720
It should be in 3-5 minutes.

4186
02:38:10,980 --> 02:38:11,220
Okay.

4187
02:38:11,820 --> 02:38:14,000
Calm down, it's Tuesday.

4188
02:38:14,800 --> 02:38:16,580
I am calm!

4189
02:38:21,580 --> 02:38:24,660
I don't know what you're talking about!

4190
02:38:27,880 --> 02:38:29,960
Everything's going wrong!

4191
02:38:30,060 --> 02:38:30,580
Bye!

4192
02:38:32,000 --> 02:38:33,640
Alright, don't worry, I'm fine.

4193
02:38:33,880 --> 02:38:34,620
I'm okay.

4194
02:38:37,220 --> 02:38:39,120
Surely nothing is wrong.

4195
02:38:41,860 --> 02:38:42,960
I just...

4196
02:38:43,860 --> 02:38:47,980
I don't know, I feel like I'm just cursed to always have PC problems...

4197
02:38:47,980 --> 02:38:50,100
For the rest of my life.

4198
02:38:50,120 --> 02:38:51,180
Some people are like that, I'll be honest.

4199
02:38:51,280 --> 02:38:53,420
I feel like I've never been lucky.

4200
02:38:53,880 --> 02:38:55,760
I've never been lucky...

4201
02:38:55,760 --> 02:38:57,400
You've never been lucky...

4202
02:38:58,060 --> 02:39:00,040
I have never been lucky.

4203
02:39:00,060 --> 02:39:02,640
I say this in front of Tenjin.

4204
02:39:02,760 --> 02:39:05,940
Tenjin, I've never been lucky in my life.

4205
02:39:06,400 --> 02:39:09,000
I say as I make thousands of dollars.

4206
02:39:10,780 --> 02:39:15,360
I say as like I make thousands of dollars every month.

4207
02:39:15,580 --> 02:39:17,960
I'm not lucky, Tenjin.

4208
02:39:23,440 --> 02:39:30,200
This 3000 plus dollars PC is not working as I intended.

4209
02:39:32,520 --> 02:39:35,420
White's like, here's a 100 dollar bill.

4210
02:39:37,840 --> 02:39:40,960
Man, I am grateful to be donated one dollar by a fan.

4211
02:39:44,160 --> 02:39:46,140
Hey man, anything goes to my bills.

4212
02:39:48,580 --> 02:39:49,480
Holy shit.

4213
02:39:57,700 --> 02:40:01,440
When does the Steam maintenance come back?

4214
02:40:04,760 --> 02:40:06,120
There's a Steam maintenance.

4215
02:40:06,140 --> 02:40:07,220
Yes, it's Tuesday.

4216
02:40:08,680 --> 02:40:10,600
Oh, so that was a thing.

4217
02:40:10,760 --> 02:40:12,120
Yeah, this is why I play on EA.

4218
02:40:13,080 --> 02:40:13,680
Bro.

4219
02:40:14,020 --> 02:40:15,140
Fuck you, bro.

4220
02:40:16,020 --> 02:40:17,100
Holy shit.

4221
02:40:18,960 --> 02:40:20,120
Okay, so...

4222
02:40:20,120 --> 02:40:23,560
Yeah, but I don't like playing on EA app.

4223
02:40:23,740 --> 02:40:24,480
It's just not convenient.

4224
02:40:25,710 --> 02:40:26,000
True.

4225
02:40:26,160 --> 02:40:27,860
It's not very convenient at all.

4226
02:40:31,020 --> 02:40:32,180
Oh my god.

4227
02:40:33,220 --> 02:40:33,800
Please.

4228
02:40:34,100 --> 02:40:35,160
I just...

4229
02:40:35,690 --> 02:40:37,880
I just wanna be part...

4230
02:40:37,880 --> 02:40:38,260
Guys!

4231
02:40:38,940 --> 02:40:41,560
Tell me when Steam is back, guys!

4232
02:40:42,640 --> 02:40:44,540
Guys, tell me when Steam is back.

4233
02:40:44,860 --> 02:40:47,640
You know I took public transport today, Tenjin.

4234
02:40:48,460 --> 02:40:52,440
I haven't taken public transport in a very long time here in Canada.

4235
02:40:52,840 --> 02:40:58,080
And like, I told my chat this, but I had to Google how to pay for bus.

4236
02:40:58,780 --> 02:40:59,720
Because I...

4237
02:40:59,720 --> 02:40:59,980
You don't...

4238
02:41:02,480 --> 02:41:04,640
You don't know how to fucking ride a bus?

4239
02:41:04,960 --> 02:41:07,220
I was confused.

4240
02:41:07,640 --> 02:41:09,080
Cause like, I...

4241
02:41:09,080 --> 02:41:09,920
No, I do.

4242
02:41:10,120 --> 02:41:13,980
But like, like the last time I rode a bus was in university.

4243
02:41:14,800 --> 02:41:16,040
And so like...

4244
02:41:16,040 --> 02:41:16,240
Uh-huh.

4245
02:41:16,240 --> 02:41:16,980
So I was just...

4246
02:41:16,980 --> 02:41:17,620
But they gave us...

4247
02:41:17,620 --> 02:41:18,080
They changed the system?

4248
02:41:18,320 --> 02:41:19,020
I don't know.

4249
02:41:19,040 --> 02:41:19,820
What if they did?

4250
02:41:20,000 --> 02:41:21,540
The last time they gave...

4251
02:41:21,540 --> 02:41:24,820
We had like university passes that work on buses.

4252
02:41:25,280 --> 02:41:26,000
So like...

4253
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:26,240
Right.

4254
02:41:26,420 --> 02:41:28,020
Obviously, I'm not in university anymore.

4255
02:41:28,300 --> 02:41:30,960
So I was just like, how to pay for...

4256
02:41:30,960 --> 02:41:31,960
Cause I don't carry change.

4257
02:41:32,120 --> 02:41:34,160
I didn't wanna fucking use change.

4258
02:41:34,360 --> 02:41:35,400
Cause I don't carry any.

4259
02:41:35,680 --> 02:41:38,060
So I was just like, how do you pay for bus?

4260
02:41:38,080 --> 02:41:38,620
You get the card?

4261
02:41:38,960 --> 02:41:39,160
How do you...

4262
02:41:39,160 --> 02:41:40,180
Yeah, but like...

4263
02:41:40,180 --> 02:41:41,760
I was like, where get card?

4264
02:41:42,020 --> 02:41:42,420
Like...

4265
02:41:44,860 --> 02:41:46,040
I don't have my...

4266
02:41:46,040 --> 02:41:46,220
I don't have my...

4267
02:41:47,460 --> 02:41:48,700
What's that name again?

4268
02:41:50,540 --> 02:41:52,500
I still have my Opus card.

4269
02:41:52,780 --> 02:41:54,440
Oh, the one in Japan?

4270
02:41:55,300 --> 02:41:56,660
No, in Montreal.

4271
02:41:57,080 --> 02:41:57,260
Oh!

4272
02:41:58,940 --> 02:42:02,600
This is how little I know about the public transport system.

4273
02:42:03,260 --> 02:42:03,860
Like...

4274
02:42:05,100 --> 02:42:07,480
It's not convenient though.

4275
02:42:07,800 --> 02:42:08,520
I feel like...

4276
02:42:08,520 --> 02:42:14,080
Compared to like Asia public transport, the public transport in Canada is not that convenient.

4277
02:42:14,540 --> 02:42:15,060
Like...

4278
02:42:15,060 --> 02:42:15,760
Uh...

4279
02:42:16,220 --> 02:42:19,060
I don't wanna talk about convenient in my time here.

4280
02:42:19,300 --> 02:42:20,300
Oh yeah.

4281
02:42:21,040 --> 02:42:24,080
Do you wanna know how to stop the bus?

4282
02:42:24,280 --> 02:42:25,560
No, the bus doesn't stop.

4283
02:42:25,760 --> 02:42:28,460
You have to fucking drop down the bus while it's moving.

4284
02:42:29,600 --> 02:42:30,480
Holy shit.

4285
02:42:30,720 --> 02:42:30,920
Yeah.

4286
02:42:31,000 --> 02:42:32,660
I was just like, how...

4287
02:42:32,660 --> 02:42:33,140
Where do I...

4288
02:42:33,140 --> 02:42:34,440
Cause I didn't wanna pay for...

4289
02:42:34,440 --> 02:42:36,240
Cause like I'm in the middle of a move.

4290
02:42:36,480 --> 02:42:37,020
So I did...

4291
02:42:37,020 --> 02:42:37,220
Cause...

4292
02:42:37,220 --> 02:42:38,800
But like I have to go back to my old...

4293
02:42:38,800 --> 02:42:39,580
Like this place.

4294
02:42:39,620 --> 02:42:40,300
My old place.

4295
02:42:40,840 --> 02:42:41,640
Cause we did...

4296
02:42:41,640 --> 02:42:42,720
I didn't move my PC setup.

4297
02:42:43,020 --> 02:42:43,900
So like...

4298
02:42:43,900 --> 02:42:44,920
I didn't want to Uber.

4299
02:42:44,920 --> 02:42:51,280
I didn't want to Uber like every day to like back to my apartment and like back to my new apartment.

4300
02:42:51,520 --> 02:42:52,740
So like I had to...

4301
02:42:52,740 --> 02:42:55,560
I was like, okay, I have to learn the public transport for real this time.

4302
02:42:55,740 --> 02:43:00,060
Like I don't want to pay like so much money every day just to go back and forth.

4303
02:43:00,780 --> 02:43:01,260
So...

4304
02:43:01,260 --> 02:43:02,040
Just get a card.

4305
02:43:02,540 --> 02:43:02,960
I did!

4306
02:43:03,380 --> 02:43:04,980
That's what the Googling was for!

4307
02:43:05,620 --> 02:43:08,920
I got the card cause that's what the Googling was!

4308
02:43:09,500 --> 02:43:12,280
I learned about the card because of Google!

4309
02:43:15,560 --> 02:43:17,340
So we were just like, just drive.

4310
02:43:17,440 --> 02:43:23,680
I haven't been behind the car wheel, the wheel of a car to drive in like...

4311
02:43:24,300 --> 02:43:26,940
I think like nine plus years now, guys.

4312
02:43:27,080 --> 02:43:29,720
I will not touch a car because of that.

4313
02:43:29,800 --> 02:43:30,560
Because I'm worried.

4314
02:43:30,780 --> 02:43:33,500
Like I should not be like...

4315
02:43:33,500 --> 02:43:37,380
I should not even have my license because I haven't touched a car for that long.

4316
02:43:37,760 --> 02:43:38,680
You should like...

4317
02:43:38,680 --> 02:43:40,380
I haven't touched a car in like five years.

4318
02:43:40,620 --> 02:43:42,160
Like I've been a passenger.

4319
02:43:42,160 --> 02:43:44,760
Like I had like chauffeurs.

4320
02:43:45,120 --> 02:43:46,040
Like as in...

4321
02:43:46,040 --> 02:43:47,300
I lost my driver's license.

4322
02:43:47,360 --> 02:43:48,500
As in my parents and...

4323
02:43:49,220 --> 02:43:50,660
Like my parents and Uber.

4324
02:43:51,060 --> 02:43:52,620
Like I never had to drive myself.

4325
02:43:52,740 --> 02:43:56,860
I literally got my license so I could go to a bar and be like, here's my license.

4326
02:43:57,180 --> 02:43:57,360
Like...

4327
02:43:58,520 --> 02:43:59,720
Use my ID.

4328
02:44:00,160 --> 02:44:03,060
I literally got the driver's license.

4329
02:44:03,220 --> 02:44:08,900
So like, you know, when you pick up packages or you go to the bar and they ID you, I don't have to bring my passport.

4330
02:44:08,980 --> 02:44:10,500
I could just be like, here's my ID.

4331
02:44:10,660 --> 02:44:12,140
That's literally the only reason why I wanted to drive.

4332
02:44:12,140 --> 02:44:12,800
I didn't care.

4333
02:44:13,060 --> 02:44:14,000
I didn't care.

4334
02:44:14,200 --> 02:44:14,980
I never...

4335
02:44:14,980 --> 02:44:17,420
After I got my driver's license, I never drove the car.

4336
02:44:18,700 --> 02:44:19,740
I never...

4337
02:44:20,540 --> 02:44:21,500
Like legit.

4338
02:44:22,040 --> 02:44:22,560
Legit.

4339
02:44:22,580 --> 02:44:23,500
Took the test.

4340
02:44:23,660 --> 02:44:24,580
Did the driving test.

4341
02:44:25,320 --> 02:44:27,020
Never touched a car after that.

4342
02:44:27,280 --> 02:44:30,360
I think you might be Indonesian.

4343
02:44:32,500 --> 02:44:34,360
There was no use.

4344
02:44:39,840 --> 02:44:41,340
Can you connect yet?

4345
02:44:41,460 --> 02:44:42,120
I don't know.

4346
02:44:42,120 --> 02:44:44,600
Is Steam back on yet?

4347
02:44:44,680 --> 02:44:47,520
I was like chat, tell me when Steam's back on.

4348
02:44:48,600 --> 02:44:50,060
Alright, let me check.

4349
02:44:50,280 --> 02:44:51,340
No, I'm still disconnected.

4350
02:44:51,940 --> 02:44:54,440
I thought it says 3 to 5 minutes.

4351
02:44:54,440 --> 02:44:55,880
Yeah, Steam is dead, dude.

4352
02:44:56,020 --> 02:44:58,700
Yes, it's Steam Tuesday.

4353
02:44:59,220 --> 02:45:00,120
Tuesday Steam.

4354
02:45:00,800 --> 02:45:01,360
Right.

4355
02:45:01,800 --> 02:45:03,960
What do you mean driving is so convenient?

4356
02:45:04,260 --> 02:45:05,560
Yeah, but like...

4357
02:45:06,060 --> 02:45:06,520
It's scary.

4358
02:45:07,280 --> 02:45:07,740
Sure.

4359
02:45:08,020 --> 02:45:08,580
It's...

4360
02:45:08,580 --> 02:45:09,020
Sure.

4361
02:45:09,300 --> 02:45:09,700
It's...

4362
02:45:09,700 --> 02:45:14,280
It's like, okay, the reason why I hate driving is because like, I don't want...

4363
02:45:14,280 --> 02:45:16,860
What if I like accidentally like run over somebody?

4364
02:45:17,600 --> 02:45:18,940
You're so white.

4365
02:45:19,920 --> 02:45:21,760
Like, it's like the possibility...

4366
02:45:21,760 --> 02:45:23,760
Commit vehicular manslaughter.

4367
02:45:24,100 --> 02:45:29,960
I'm just like, what if I accidentally, you know, just accidentally run over somebody?

4368
02:45:30,680 --> 02:45:32,280
I don't want to deal with that.

4369
02:45:32,800 --> 02:45:34,160
The heck happened to your license?

4370
02:45:34,320 --> 02:45:34,440
As long as...

4371
02:45:34,440 --> 02:45:35,700
Yeah, it got confiscated.

4372
02:45:35,720 --> 02:45:36,080
Yes.

4373
02:45:36,520 --> 02:45:38,520
Yeah, how did your license get confiscated?

4374
02:45:38,520 --> 02:45:39,380
What did you do?

4375
02:45:40,420 --> 02:45:41,140
Illegal racing.

4376
02:45:41,340 --> 02:45:41,740
Definitely.

4377
02:45:41,740 --> 02:45:43,660
That is supposed to not like happen.

4378
02:45:44,040 --> 02:45:44,600
But hey.

4379
02:45:46,240 --> 02:45:47,560
Hey, man, I needed money.

4380
02:45:47,620 --> 02:45:48,100
You got caught?

4381
02:45:48,540 --> 02:45:49,180
Look at him.

4382
02:45:49,180 --> 02:45:50,700
Hey, man, I needed money.

4383
02:45:51,000 --> 02:45:51,700
Look at that.

4384
02:45:51,700 --> 02:45:53,060
He got caught.

4385
02:45:53,580 --> 02:45:53,980
No, no.

4386
02:45:54,060 --> 02:45:54,720
The thing is...

4387
02:45:54,720 --> 02:45:56,520
Okay, the story was...

4388
02:45:56,520 --> 02:46:02,660
Okay, again, I don't condone this, but the guy who was supposed to pay the road, quote, unquote, you know what I mean?

4389
02:46:03,200 --> 02:46:03,600
Yeah.

4390
02:46:04,280 --> 02:46:05,840
Took away the money and run away.

4391
02:46:07,600 --> 02:46:08,400
So, so...

4392
02:46:08,400 --> 02:46:08,500
I don't know.

4393
02:46:09,340 --> 02:46:09,860
I don't know.

4394
02:46:10,500 --> 02:46:13,600
Headless and ha-ha.

4395
02:46:13,600 --> 02:46:15,600
Oh, what the fuck?

4396
02:46:15,740 --> 02:46:16,160
Yeah.

4397
02:46:16,580 --> 02:46:17,060
Oops.

4398
02:46:19,100 --> 02:46:19,620
They...

4399
02:46:21,740 --> 02:46:23,400
They took the money?

4400
02:46:24,300 --> 02:46:25,560
Yeah, they took the money.

4401
02:46:25,780 --> 02:46:26,640
That's fucking crazy.

4402
02:46:26,640 --> 02:46:27,120
They didn't pay.

4403
02:46:27,180 --> 02:46:28,200
They ran away with the money.

4404
02:46:28,440 --> 02:46:29,600
Holy shit.

4405
02:46:30,180 --> 02:46:31,200
That's crazy.

4406
02:46:32,500 --> 02:46:33,580
That's actually insane.

4407
02:46:35,020 --> 02:46:36,180
Anyway, do you still...

4408
02:46:36,180 --> 02:46:37,500
Do you still...

4409
02:46:37,500 --> 02:46:39,200
Will you still do it?

4410
02:46:39,380 --> 02:46:40,440
Will you still illegally race?

4411
02:46:41,160 --> 02:46:43,880
I haven't even touched the car in five years man.

4412
02:46:44,080 --> 02:46:47,240
Wait in five... that was five years ago?

4413
02:46:47,700 --> 02:46:50,520
Yeah because I cannot issue a new license.

4414
02:46:50,840 --> 02:46:51,480
That's the thing.

4415
02:46:51,500 --> 02:46:53,280
Oh because like it's gone gone forever?

4416
02:46:53,540 --> 02:46:53,860
I'm banned.

4417
02:46:54,060 --> 02:46:56,980
I can apply now.

4418
02:46:57,260 --> 02:46:58,080
Oh okay.

4419
02:46:58,140 --> 02:46:59,360
Yeah why don't you apply for it?

4420
02:47:01,560 --> 02:47:02,740
We don't have a car.

4421
02:47:03,140 --> 02:47:04,840
Oh shit.

4422
02:47:06,940 --> 02:47:08,440
I was gonna say.

4423
02:47:08,560 --> 02:47:09,460
I was like...

4424
02:47:10,460 --> 02:47:11,000
Oh whoa.

4425
02:47:11,560 --> 02:47:12,320
Guys.

4426
02:47:12,840 --> 02:47:13,660
Guys.

4427
02:47:14,020 --> 02:47:17,260
Why is the maintenance still going on?

4428
02:47:17,440 --> 02:47:18,520
I don't understand.

4429
02:47:19,180 --> 02:47:21,300
I just want a game.

4430
02:47:21,960 --> 02:47:22,780
Guys.

4431
02:47:23,460 --> 02:47:25,980
I just want to play the video game.

4432
02:47:29,140 --> 02:47:29,960
Alright.

4433
02:47:30,120 --> 02:47:34,460
How long do Steam maintenance last?

4434
02:47:35,560 --> 02:47:36,380
Alright.

4435
02:47:36,480 --> 02:47:39,280
How long do Steam maintenance last?

4436
02:47:40,460 --> 02:47:44,000
We try... it usually lasts less than an hour.

4437
02:47:44,460 --> 02:47:45,020
What?

4438
02:47:46,260 --> 02:47:47,400
When did it start?

4439
02:47:51,080 --> 02:47:53,500
When did the maintenance start?

4440
02:47:56,200 --> 02:47:57,180
20 minutes?

4441
02:47:57,700 --> 02:47:59,040
It was like... 20 minutes?

4442
02:47:59,140 --> 02:48:00,940
No it's like supposed to be 20 minutes.

4443
02:48:03,820 --> 02:48:04,380
Sorry.

4444
02:48:05,260 --> 02:48:06,420
20 fucking minutes.

4445
02:48:06,620 --> 02:48:07,040
Oh in a minute.

4446
02:48:07,220 --> 02:48:11,440
Then it should be done in a... I can't believe I locked out of Apex.

4447
02:48:11,440 --> 02:48:13,880
The moment the Steam maintenance started.

4448
02:48:14,020 --> 02:48:15,540
I'm so unlucky.

4449
02:48:15,680 --> 02:48:17,320
I think you're still connected.

4450
02:48:17,780 --> 02:48:19,120
No I would be.

4451
02:48:19,600 --> 02:48:20,180
That's the thing.

4452
02:48:20,180 --> 02:48:20,660
You would be.

4453
02:48:20,880 --> 02:48:21,260
You would be.

4454
02:48:21,300 --> 02:48:22,240
I think you would be.

4455
02:48:22,240 --> 02:48:23,820
That's actually so... I'm so unlucky.

4456
02:48:24,020 --> 02:48:25,180
I swear to God.

4457
02:48:25,260 --> 02:48:26,060
I'm so unlucky.

4458
02:48:26,500 --> 02:48:28,820
I cry on my $50 bills.

4459
02:48:32,680 --> 02:48:40,840
I say as Tenjin's fucking driver's license got confiscated because of illegal driving.

4460
02:48:41,440 --> 02:48:41,860
I...

4461
02:48:45,340 --> 02:48:48,720
Someone was like only $50 bills.

4462
02:48:54,960 --> 02:48:56,360
Oh no guys.

4463
02:48:56,520 --> 02:48:58,480
$5 is enough to feed me for two weeks.

4464
02:49:02,880 --> 02:49:04,540
Tenjin it's not about you right now.

4465
02:49:04,580 --> 02:49:05,100
It's about...

4466
02:49:06,080 --> 02:49:08,460
Yeah it's... clearly not.

4467
02:49:13,460 --> 02:49:14,720
Oh my god.

4468
02:49:14,820 --> 02:49:15,380
Oh my god.

4469
02:49:15,380 --> 02:49:15,880
It's awful.

4470
02:49:16,180 --> 02:49:16,860
It's not...

4471
02:49:18,720 --> 02:49:20,440
Oh my god.

4472
02:49:20,480 --> 02:49:21,900
I'm so sad.

4473
02:49:24,420 --> 02:49:34,240
I think the worst part is the fact that I have to take the PC back because I don't know how... I'm scared of adding RAM to my PC.

4474
02:49:34,260 --> 02:49:34,840
The fuck?

4475
02:49:34,840 --> 02:49:35,460
It's just a RAM.

4476
02:49:35,800 --> 02:49:36,300
I'm scared.

4477
02:49:37,120 --> 02:49:37,500
Oh.

4478
02:49:38,400 --> 02:49:39,540
But like...

4479
02:49:39,540 --> 02:49:40,300
But what if I...

4480
02:49:40,300 --> 02:49:42,320
Apply me there and I'll install your app.

4481
02:49:44,200 --> 02:49:46,280
I might as well fucking put it in game!

4482
02:49:46,640 --> 02:49:49,420
It's really cheaper than fucking bring this in.

4483
02:49:49,580 --> 02:49:49,680
That's the thing.

4484
02:49:49,800 --> 02:49:52,620
Just put it in yourself.

4485
02:49:52,620 --> 02:49:54,160
I'm scared of breaking it.

4486
02:49:54,320 --> 02:49:55,700
What if I break it?

4487
02:49:56,260 --> 02:49:57,940
Then you'll get another PC.

4488
02:49:58,820 --> 02:50:01,080
Yeah, but I can't fucking...

4489
02:50:01,080 --> 02:50:03,320
Getting a new PC is like...

4490
02:50:04,680 --> 02:50:06,620
It takes a lot of time.

4491
02:50:07,300 --> 02:50:08,840
Oh yeah, I could ask them.

4492
02:50:08,940 --> 02:50:10,260
I could actually ask Kyle.

4493
02:50:10,260 --> 02:50:12,080
It will be a content.

4494
02:50:12,280 --> 02:50:16,040
Flying my Indonesian friend to Canada to install my RAM.

4495
02:50:16,640 --> 02:50:20,600
Hyatt was actually down to buy for any upgrades and stuff.

4496
02:50:20,680 --> 02:50:21,780
So I just need to message them.

4497
02:50:21,820 --> 02:50:26,400
Can you compensate for my more RAM, please?

4498
02:50:27,000 --> 02:50:28,420
Oh, thank you.

4499
02:50:28,540 --> 02:50:30,120
Thank you so much, Ritual.

4500
02:50:30,680 --> 02:50:32,260
Someone throw you $50.

4501
02:50:32,700 --> 02:50:34,640
No, they threw...

4502
02:50:34,640 --> 02:50:35,680
They gave me some tissues.

4503
02:50:36,060 --> 02:50:38,060
Oh my god, thank you, Ritual, for the tissues.

4504
02:50:38,180 --> 02:50:40,100
My $50 tissues.

4505
02:50:40,260 --> 02:50:42,420
Oh my god.

4506
02:50:42,540 --> 02:50:44,160
The tissues are real.

4507
02:50:45,420 --> 02:50:46,840
Just for you.

4508
02:50:50,640 --> 02:50:51,840
My $50.

4509
02:50:52,120 --> 02:50:52,720
My $50.

4510
02:50:53,160 --> 02:50:55,620
My $50.

4511
02:50:56,160 --> 02:50:56,860
My $50.

4512
02:50:56,860 --> 02:50:58,200
Tissue funds are so real.

4513
02:50:58,280 --> 02:50:58,940
So real.

4514
02:51:02,340 --> 02:51:02,940
Alright.

4515
02:51:03,100 --> 02:51:04,880
I lost the $50 already.

4516
02:51:05,040 --> 02:51:05,680
I lost it.

4517
02:51:06,820 --> 02:51:07,620
Pizza time.

4518
02:51:07,680 --> 02:51:09,160
Someone sent me pizza time.

4519
02:51:10,260 --> 02:51:10,920
Where's the tissue?

4520
02:51:11,020 --> 02:51:11,700
I need tissue as well.

4521
02:51:11,700 --> 02:51:12,360
Where's your tissue?

4522
02:51:15,080 --> 02:51:15,700
Don't worry.

4523
02:51:15,760 --> 02:51:16,240
Okay, you know what?

4524
02:51:16,280 --> 02:51:16,680
Never mind.

4525
02:51:16,780 --> 02:51:17,980
Food is so real.

4526
02:51:18,100 --> 02:51:18,840
No, no, no, no.

4527
02:51:18,840 --> 02:51:20,900
You want tissues, Ten?

4528
02:51:25,340 --> 02:51:27,240
We are not in the pandemic.

4529
02:51:29,120 --> 02:51:30,640
Don't worry, Tenjin.

4530
02:51:30,820 --> 02:51:31,380
Don't worry.

4531
02:51:31,500 --> 02:51:32,480
What the fuck?

4532
02:51:33,120 --> 02:51:34,080
$20 tissue?

4533
02:51:34,320 --> 02:51:35,160
What the fuck?

4534
02:51:36,180 --> 02:51:37,020
$20 tissue?

4535
02:51:37,800 --> 02:51:38,980
Here's your tissue.

4536
02:51:41,460 --> 02:51:41,980
Here's your tissue.

4537
02:51:42,440 --> 02:51:42,960
Wait.

4538
02:51:43,600 --> 02:51:44,660
No, I don't.

4539
02:51:45,020 --> 02:51:45,940
Oh my god.

4540
02:51:46,360 --> 02:51:47,460
I'm sorry.

4541
02:51:47,740 --> 02:51:48,400
I'm not...

4542
02:51:48,400 --> 02:51:50,640
I'm not gonna find my credit card.

4543
02:51:50,820 --> 02:51:52,560
You don't even get tissues from me.

4544
02:51:52,560 --> 02:51:52,960
I'm not even...

4545
02:51:52,960 --> 02:51:57,080
I was gonna give you a $2 super chat.

4546
02:51:57,300 --> 02:51:57,720
I'm sorry.

4547
02:51:57,860 --> 02:51:59,140
And be like, here's a tissue.

4548
02:52:00,600 --> 02:52:03,080
From my $50 super chat.

4549
02:52:03,160 --> 02:52:04,360
I was gonna give you $2.

4550
02:52:04,360 --> 02:52:07,760
And be like, here's a tissue.

4551
02:52:08,040 --> 02:52:09,740
If you are throwing tissues, I'm scared now.

4552
02:52:10,240 --> 02:52:10,800
But like...

4553
02:52:12,320 --> 02:52:14,900
I can't be bothered to like...

4554
02:52:14,900 --> 02:52:16,620
I can't be bothered to like...

4555
02:52:16,620 --> 02:52:18,100
find my credit card right now.

4556
02:52:20,120 --> 02:52:22,200
I was defeated by laziness.

4557
02:52:22,720 --> 02:52:25,520
Why the fuck would I remember my credit card?

4558
02:52:26,040 --> 02:52:27,380
I somehow remember mine.

4559
02:52:27,400 --> 02:52:27,960
I somehow remember mine.

4560
02:52:28,920 --> 02:52:30,760
Because I'm too lazy to get it.

4561
02:52:30,760 --> 02:52:31,420
Are you okay now?

4562
02:52:31,840 --> 02:52:33,480
No, why am I still disconnected?

4563
02:52:33,920 --> 02:52:36,380
How do I force it to connect to my Steam?

4564
02:52:38,160 --> 02:52:38,800
Oh no.

4565
02:52:39,440 --> 02:52:40,320
Oh no.

4566
02:52:41,840 --> 02:52:42,280
Okay.

4567
02:52:44,580 --> 02:52:45,980
Here's a tissue for Tenjin.

4568
02:52:46,020 --> 02:52:46,720
Thank you guys.

4569
02:52:47,160 --> 02:52:49,680
Thank you for the tissues.

4570
02:52:49,820 --> 02:52:52,080
If we add it all up, I can use it all at once.

4571
02:52:53,640 --> 02:52:54,900
To get a new RAM.

4572
02:52:55,320 --> 02:52:55,760
Okay.

4573
02:52:56,240 --> 02:52:56,940
Let's see.

4574
02:52:57,100 --> 02:52:58,520
I do need RAM though.

4575
02:52:58,660 --> 02:53:00,740
I feel like RAM would fix... RAM always fix things.

4576
02:53:01,740 --> 02:53:05,320
You know you can install 256 GB of RAM.

4577
02:53:05,480 --> 02:53:05,980
But I don't know.

4578
02:53:06,060 --> 02:53:07,160
I don't know if I have...

4579
02:53:07,160 --> 02:53:08,320
I don't know if it fits.

4580
02:53:08,400 --> 02:53:09,020
That's the thing.

4581
02:53:09,800 --> 02:53:10,160
Okay.

4582
02:53:10,280 --> 02:53:10,600
Wait.

4583
02:53:10,680 --> 02:53:11,720
Why isn't it not...

4584
02:53:11,720 --> 02:53:11,880
Okay.

4585
02:53:11,920 --> 02:53:12,820
I'm going to restart my Steam.

4586
02:53:13,780 --> 02:53:14,080
Wait.

4587
02:53:14,120 --> 02:53:14,220
No.

4588
02:53:14,220 --> 02:53:15,580
If I restart my Steam, then I disappear.

4589
02:53:16,480 --> 02:53:16,840
God.

4590
02:53:16,840 --> 02:53:17,600
There's so many issues.

4591
02:53:17,720 --> 02:53:17,920
Guys.

4592
02:53:18,000 --> 02:53:18,720
How do I...

4593
02:53:18,720 --> 02:53:20,520
How the fuck do I like...

4594
02:53:20,520 --> 02:53:22,780
Why is it disconnected?

4595
02:53:23,120 --> 02:53:23,860
Why are you disconnected?

4596
02:53:26,300 --> 02:53:27,160
I'm a mess.

4597
02:53:28,160 --> 02:53:29,520
I'm a mess right now.

4598
02:53:30,760 --> 02:53:30,960
Why is it disconnected?

4599
02:53:31,560 --> 02:53:32,600
I don't understand.

4600
02:53:33,660 --> 02:53:34,840
Is this...

4601
02:53:34,840 --> 02:53:36,460
How am I offline?

4602
02:53:38,480 --> 02:53:39,120
Okay.

4603
02:53:39,860 --> 02:53:41,460
I'm going to restart Apex.

4604
02:53:41,960 --> 02:53:42,800
Oh my god.

4605
02:53:42,820 --> 02:53:44,660
We can finally play a fucking game.

4606
02:53:44,960 --> 02:53:47,660
We literally played two games.

4607
02:53:47,880 --> 02:53:49,340
We played two games.

4608
02:53:51,180 --> 02:53:53,040
This is the Doki experience.

4609
02:53:53,740 --> 02:53:54,780
Every time Apex.

4610
02:53:54,880 --> 02:53:55,860
Just Apex.

4611
02:53:56,580 --> 02:53:58,820
Apex doesn't want to Apex sometimes.

4612
02:53:59,180 --> 02:53:59,460
Yeah.

4613
02:54:03,700 --> 02:54:04,800
We won the game.

4614
02:54:04,880 --> 02:54:05,960
That's all that matters, right?

4615
02:54:06,920 --> 02:54:07,560
Alright.

4616
02:54:08,340 --> 02:54:09,220
What is it?

4617
02:54:09,260 --> 02:54:09,680
Our third.

4618
02:54:09,860 --> 02:54:11,340
It carried us to victory.

4619
02:54:11,720 --> 02:54:12,360
Alright.

4620
02:54:12,560 --> 02:54:13,780
I swear to god.

4621
02:54:13,860 --> 02:54:14,500
Let me in.

4622
02:54:18,130 --> 02:54:20,150
Go to top right Steam.

4623
02:54:20,350 --> 02:54:21,250
Then go online.

4624
02:54:21,910 --> 02:54:22,870

4626
02:54:25,330 --> 02:54:26,770
It's just... I'm not.

4627
02:54:27,270 --> 02:54:28,850
Are you fucking kidding me?

4628
02:54:28,850 --> 02:54:29,130
Oh!

4629
02:54:29,310 --> 02:54:29,750

4630
02:54:30,790 --> 02:54:31,670
You're in?

4631
02:54:31,790 --> 02:54:32,230

4632
02:54:32,230 --> 02:54:32,470

4635
02:54:35,310 --> 02:54:35,710
Okay.

4636
02:54:36,710 --> 02:54:37,650
I'm not actually in.

4637
02:54:38,690 --> 02:54:40,850
But like... I can play for like...

4638
02:54:40,850 --> 02:54:42,370
I can play for like 40 more minutes.

4639
02:54:42,730 --> 02:54:42,750
I'm gonna cry.

4640
02:54:44,710 --> 02:54:47,290
I got my time wrong.

4641
02:54:47,570 --> 02:54:47,610
Fan merch?

4642
02:54:47,610 --> 02:54:47,910
Tissues?

4643
02:54:48,050 --> 02:54:48,330
No.

4644
02:54:48,390 --> 02:54:49,830
My fan merch would be like...

4645
02:54:49,830 --> 02:54:50,030
Oh my god.

4646
02:54:50,090 --> 02:54:51,510
You should make fan merch for...

4647
02:54:51,510 --> 02:54:54,250
You should make official... I'm gonna make official merch.

4648
02:54:54,410 --> 02:54:57,170
Where like the tissues are like super chats.

4649
02:54:57,370 --> 02:54:58,130
And then...

4650
02:55:02,120 --> 02:55:02,600
Wait.

4651
02:55:02,860 --> 02:55:03,360
That's so smart.

4652
02:55:03,360 --> 02:55:05,480
If I were to have a merch, it's gonna be a cigarette.

4653
02:55:05,640 --> 02:55:07,080
I don't even know like...

4654
02:55:07,080 --> 02:55:07,460

4655
02:55:07,720 --> 02:55:08,560
Oh my god.

4656
02:55:08,700 --> 02:55:10,320
Can you like... Oh that would be...

4657
02:55:10,320 --> 02:55:12,740
I wonder if you can make like a tissue box with like tissues.

4658
02:55:12,960 --> 02:55:15,860
And then the tissues are like color coded to the super chats.

4659
02:55:16,200 --> 02:55:19,040
And then like the box itself would be...

4660
02:55:19,040 --> 02:55:20,600
Would be like you know me crying.

4661
02:55:20,720 --> 02:55:21,540

Super chats with tissues.

4664
02:55:28,840 --> 02:55:30,480
It would be color coded.

4665
02:55:30,600 --> 02:55:32,480
Into like super chats.

4666
02:55:33,380 --> 02:55:33,900
Careful.

4667
02:55:36,300 --> 02:55:37,740
Into the box itself.

4668
02:55:38,240 --> 02:55:39,540
I wonder if I can get that made.

4669
02:55:40,900 --> 02:55:42,000
Use the tissues?

4670
02:55:42,300 --> 02:55:42,400
No.

4671
02:55:42,520 --> 02:55:44,020
What the fuck is wrong with you?

4672
02:55:45,500 --> 02:55:46,680

4673
02:55:46,920 --> 02:55:47,520
Oh my gosh.

4674
02:55:47,600 --> 02:55:49,220
Is this the preload shaders part?

4675
02:55:49,600 --> 02:55:51,380
Chat is this why it's taking so long?

4676
02:55:51,640 --> 02:55:53,740
Is it loading in my shaders right now?

4677
02:55:54,080 --> 02:55:54,960
Is it...

4678
02:55:54,960 --> 02:55:56,000
Jesus Christ.

4679
02:55:56,580 --> 02:55:58,240
People are throwing stuff.

4680
02:55:58,920 --> 02:55:59,440

4681
02:56:00,600 --> 02:56:01,260

02:56:02,780 --> 02:56:04,480
The super chat tissue box.

4684
02:56:04,700 --> 02:56:05,620
Oh my god.

4685
02:56:05,900 --> 02:56:07,300
It could go viral.

4686
02:56:08,100 --> 02:56:10,220
It could go definitely viral.

4687
02:56:11,000 --> 02:56:12,660

4688
02:56:12,660 --> 02:56:14,020

4694
02:56:22,340 --> 02:56:23,740

4697
02:56:27,120 --> 02:56:27,680
Tissue manufacturers.

4698
02:56:28,020 --> 02:56:30,620
Tissue paper manufacturers.

4699
02:56:31,400 --> 02:56:32,980
Is that actually possible?

4700
02:56:33,440 --> 02:56:34,660
Oh my god.

4701
02:56:35,020 --> 02:56:37,200

02:56:46,760 --> 02:56:47,760
Is there colored tissues?

4708
02:56:48,300 --> 02:56:53,620
I've got a black toilet paper for some fucking no reason.

4709
02:56:53,700 --> 02:56:54,500

4710

4716
02:57:04,980 --> 02:57:07,300
You know people can use up a tissue box.

4717
02:57:07,440 --> 02:57:08,580
Like tissue box.

4718
02:57:08,820 --> 02:57:12,300
So like force them to buy more tissue boxes.

4719
02:57:12,800 --> 02:57:16,020
And I'm gonna have the monopoly on Vtuber tissue boxes.

02:57:17,020 --> 02:57:17,540
And I'm gonna have the monopoly on Vtuber tissue boxes.

4721
02:57:17,540 --> 02:57:18,100

4727
02:57:27,570 --> 02:57:28,630
That's the game.

4728
02:57:29,190 --> 02:57:33,130
If I see another Vtuber releases a tissue box.

4729
02:57:33,330 --> 02:57:35,230
Before I release the tissue box.

4730
02:57:35,410 --> 02:57:36,470
I swear to god.

4731
02:57:36,770 --> 02:57:37,770
I'm just kidding.

4732
02:57:39,250 --> 02:57:41,120
I need a patent.

4733
02:57:43,270 --> 02:57:44,170
Patent it.

4735
02:57:44,990 --> 02:57:46,110
You're gonna make a patent?

I can't ready up yet.

4741
02:57:57,830 --> 02:58:00,510
Prepare for some fan merch.

4742
02:58:00,570 --> 02:58:00,790
Wait.

4743
02:58:00,810 --> 02:58:01,850

I think something is wrong with my camera.

4748
02:58:11,090 --> 02:58:12,630
I'm gonna go to fire.

4749

Okay we're gonna fire range real fast.

4752
02:58:19,670 --> 02:58:20,530
Tissue box.

4753
02:58:20,810 --> 02:58:22,890
I will have a monopoly.

4754
02:58:23,070 --> 02:58:24,830
On Vtuber tissue boxes.

4755
02:58:24,830 --> 02:58:27,890
Cause I will figure out how to color code it.

4756
02:58:28,010 --> 02:58:33,690
So that it's like blue, orange, yellow, pink, red and everything.

4757
02:58:34,030 --> 02:58:34,590
And then okay.

4758

Cause like for some reason my game.

You can have four players.

4762
02:58:39,310 --> 02:58:40,910
It had like quad mode back on.

4763
02:58:40,990 --> 02:58:41,830

02:58:46,650 --> 02:58:48,110
I downgraded my patch.

4767
02:58:49,670 --> 02:58:50,450
Holy shit.

02:59:23,150 --> 02:59:25,990
And then the box will be like me crying.

4787
02:59:26,170 --> 02:59:28,250
And be like Super Chat Tissues.

4788
02:59:28,250 --> 02:59:29,730
And it will be like different colors.

4789
02:59:29,890 --> 02:59:30,750
And stuff.

4790
02:59:31,730 --> 02:59:36,370
This is the birth of my billion dollar idea.

4791
02:59:36,710 --> 02:59:37,550
This is the birth of my billion dollar idea.

4792
02:59:37,550 --> 02:59:37,770

4793
02:59:37,770 --> 02:59:40,170

4794
02:59:40,210 --> 02:59:42,270

4795
02:59:42,930 --> 02:59:44,370

4796
02:59:44,450 --> 02:59:46,490
This is a billion dollar idea Chat.

4797
02:59:46,530 --> 02:59:50,250
Like this is actually a billion dollar.

4798
02:59:51,170 --> 02:59:52,330
Like this is actually a billion dollar idea Chat.

4799
02:59:52,350 --> 02:59:53,410
Since it's a super niche.

4800
02:59:53,790 --> 02:59:57,150
If I'm the only one that has made it...

4801
02:59:57,150 --> 02:59:57,490
If I'm the only one that has made it...

4802
02:59:57,490 --> 02:59:59,790
then like I'll be the only person...

4803
03:00:00,350 --> 03:00:02,930
that people have to buy it from...

4804
03:00:02,930 --> 03:00:03,390
that people have to buy it from...

4805
03:00:03,390 --> 03:00:04,970

4806
03:00:05,890 --> 03:00:07,290
Oh my god.

4807
03:00:08,430 --> 03:00:09,810

03:00:18,690 --> 03:00:20,630
This is pretty weird.

4810
03:00:20,630 --> 03:00:24,770
It is like why would you use that instead of like clinics or like

4811
03:00:29,010 --> 03:00:33,210
That instead of like clinics or like all the other big brands

4812
03:00:36,290 --> 03:00:39,590
But a Vtuber has not made merch of it!

4813
03:00:39,870 --> 03:00:42,250
Also why is there 13 players in queue?

4814
03:00:42,350 --> 03:00:43,690
Has this game died already?

4815
03:00:46,310 --> 03:00:51,650
The season failed 13 players in queue?

4816
03:00:52,710 --> 03:00:55,950

4831
03:01:42,150 --> 03:01:46,210

03:02:05,770 --> 03:02:10,970
Oh my god Oh my god, that is...

4842
03:02:10,970 --> 03:02:19,250
But there's a little bit of a downside you can't tell if you clean it properly or not Oh, why did you say that?

4843
03:02:19,250 --> 03:02:20,130
I didn't want to know!

4844
03:02:20,270 --> 03:02:20,590
Why did you say that?

4845
03:02:20,590 --> 03:02:20,590
I didn't want to know!

4846
03:02:20,610 --> 03:02:22,050
Why did you say that?

4847
03:02:22,050 --> 03:02:24,550
Hey man, I'd say you wouldn't even know!

No, I said chat!

4855
03:02:37,290 --> 03:02:40,670
Mine was just to wipe your tears.

4856
03:02:41,110 --> 03:02:43,070
It's just to wipe your tears.

4857
03:02:43,150 --> 03:02:44,450

03:02:44,870 --> 03:02:46,270
Of super chat money.

4859
03:02:46,590 --> 03:02:47,130
But...

4860
03:02:49,450 --> 03:02:50,510

4861
03:02:51,090 --> 03:02:51,610

03:02:52,370 --> 03:02:53,330

It's interesting.

4866
03:02:59,430 --> 03:02:59,790
I've never seen it.

4867
03:02:59,790 --> 03:03:02,170
I was like why were you using toilet paper when you have a bidet?

4868
03:03:02,430 --> 03:03:03,610
You don't need to buy...

4869
03:03:03,610 --> 03:03:07,330
You really don't need to buy toilet paper anymore.

4870
03:03:07,550 --> 03:03:08,330

4871
03:03:08,930 --> 03:03:09,890

4873
03:03:12,470 --> 03:03:12,890

4874
03:03:12,890 --> 03:03:14,010

4881
03:03:25,730 --> 03:03:27,750
What the fuck is a bidet shower?

4882
03:03:28,230 --> 03:03:30,230
You don't know what a toilet bidet is?

4883
03:03:30,230 --> 03:03:31,650
I live in N.A.

4884
03:03:31,930 --> 03:03:34,710
The toilet paper company has...

4885
03:03:34,710 --> 03:03:36,810

4886
03:03:36,950 --> 03:03:39,870

They like got rid of like...

4893
03:03:57,510 --> 03:04:00,430
They made bidets not popular in N.A.

4894
03:04:00,430 --> 03:04:01,370
Because they're like...

4895
03:04:01,370 --> 03:04:03,030
Bidets are not useful.

4896
03:04:03,430 --> 03:04:04,690
But like they are.

4897
03:04:08,210 --> 03:04:09,390

03:04:12,590 --> 03:04:12,850
I want to go back to bidets.

How is there 30?

4902
03:04:14,510 --> 03:04:15,690
What the fuck?

4903
03:04:16,030 --> 03:04:18,370
Why is no one playing this game?

4904
03:04:18,690 --> 03:04:20,090
No one is up in the game yet.

4905
03:04:20,430 --> 03:04:21,070
I don't understand.

4906
03:04:21,810 --> 03:04:23,010
Alright you're coming to N.A.

4907
03:04:23,270 --> 03:04:23,750

I literally have 30 minutes left to game.

4911
03:04:30,250 --> 03:04:30,730
Attention.

4912
03:04:31,010 --> 03:04:33,410
Why do you only have 30 minutes?

4913
03:04:33,530 --> 03:04:34,530
Because I have to do recording.

4914
03:04:34,630 --> 03:04:35,390
I told you.

4915
03:04:35,590 --> 03:04:37,790
After recording we play the game.

4916
03:04:38,190 --> 03:04:39,510
Oh my god.

4917
03:04:42,870 --> 03:04:43,750

Go leave.

4921
03:04:50,950 --> 03:04:53,170
N.A's queue is at least a bit alive.

4922
03:04:55,810 --> 03:04:56,990
Are you in yet?

4923
03:04:57,450 --> 03:04:59,630

03:05:00,150 --> 03:05:00,670
Alright.

03:05:00,950 --> 03:05:02,070

Where the fuck are you?

4927
03:05:04,130 --> 03:05:05,070
I think I'm invisible.

4928
03:05:05,490 --> 03:05:05,670
Hold on.

4929
03:05:05,890 --> 03:05:07,810

I'm going to have a heart attack.

4941
03:05:28,170 --> 03:05:30,290

4942
03:05:30,730 --> 03:05:32,170

03:05:32,290 --> 03:05:33,050
Big toilet paper lies.

4944
03:05:33,890 --> 03:05:36,210
Oh my god look we're almost in game.

4945
03:05:37,350 --> 03:05:39,710
We're at 44 players in queue.

4946
03:05:39,910 --> 03:05:41,030
How did this get?

4947
03:05:41,150 --> 03:05:42,150
I don't understand.

4948
03:05:42,950 --> 03:05:48,110
The patch came out in like 11, 12, 1, 2, 3, 4.

03:05:48,350 --> 03:05:49,970

Sorry I had to count my fingers because I can't.

4951
03:05:52,530 --> 03:05:53,150
Numbers.

4952
03:05:54,970 --> 03:05:58,530
The patch literally came out 6 hours ago.

4953
03:05:58,650 --> 03:06:00,950
How are we waiting in queue?

4954
03:06:01,210 --> 03:06:02,510
Like I don't understand.

4955
03:06:05,150 --> 03:06:10,550
Oh my god.

4957
03:06:15,230 --> 03:06:16,610
I'm so confused.

4958
03:06:16,870 --> 03:06:18,490
You can't be like Steam was down.

4959
03:06:18,730 --> 03:06:19,810
Steam's back up.

4960
03:06:20,150 --> 03:06:21,050
It's back up now.

4961
03:06:21,670 --> 03:06:22,270
How?

4962
03:06:23,930 --> 03:06:25,470

4964
03:06:26,410 --> 03:06:27,510
I'm in N.A.

4965
03:06:27,510 --> 03:06:28,510
This game's dead.

4966
03:06:30,410 --> 03:06:32,810
There's more people left?

4967
03:06:34,010 --> 03:06:36,710
There's more people in Tarkov than this game apparently.

4968
03:06:37,150 --> 03:06:37,730
God damn.

4969
03:06:38,370 --> 03:06:39,850
What are they playing?

4970
03:06:39,850 --> 03:06:43,330
I can literally only play one game mode.

4971
03:06:43,490 --> 03:06:44,470
And rank.

4972
03:06:44,590 --> 03:06:46,410
What else are they playing?

4973
03:06:47,730 --> 03:06:48,890
What's the other one?

4974
03:06:50,250 --> 03:06:51,970
Are they playing bot royale?

4975
03:06:52,170 --> 03:06:53,270
We're playing bot royale.

4976
03:06:55,390 --> 03:06:57,490
I actually tried bot royale.

4977
03:06:57,530 --> 03:06:58,510
It's so goofy.

4978
03:06:58,970 --> 03:07:01,530
It is so goofy.

4979
03:07:01,710 --> 03:07:02,790
I swear it's so goofy.

4980
03:07:03,890 --> 03:07:06,510
At least we can fill up the server.

4981
03:07:06,750 --> 03:07:08,030
With fucking bots.

4982
03:07:08,030 --> 03:07:09,850
At least we can.

4983
03:07:14,230 --> 03:07:16,050
Oh my god.

4984
03:07:16,690 --> 03:07:17,710
Oh my god.

4985
03:07:17,750 --> 03:07:21,490
Why does it take forever to fucking set up bot royale?

4986
03:07:22,310 --> 03:07:22,870
Why does it take forever to fucking set up bot royale?

4987
03:07:22,870 --> 03:07:23,490
This is...

4988
03:07:23,990 --> 03:07:25,650
What is wrong with this game?

4989
03:07:28,370 --> 03:07:29,730
There's two players in queue.

4990
03:07:29,850 --> 03:07:31,950
Yes there should be only two players in queue.

4991
03:07:32,850 --> 03:07:34,210
The rest are bots.

4992
03:07:34,630 --> 03:07:35,450
Okay there we go.

4993
03:07:35,850 --> 03:07:37,910
Alright we're playing bot royale right now.

4994
03:07:38,030 --> 03:07:38,590
I can't.

4995
03:07:39,090 --> 03:07:40,970
I just wanna shoot my gun.

4996
03:07:44,750 --> 03:07:46,270
I swear it's goofy as shit.

4997
03:07:46,470 --> 03:07:49,930
Is Fanatic Whisper a real player or like a bot?

4998
03:07:50,730 --> 03:07:51,370
You'll see.

4999
03:07:51,870 --> 03:07:52,610
I'll see?

5000
03:07:53,350 --> 03:07:54,430
We'll see.

5001
03:07:55,730 --> 03:07:56,290
Alright.

5002
03:07:58,970 --> 03:07:59,530
Okay.

5003
03:07:59,570 --> 03:08:01,890
Who do I wanna play that kills players fast?

5004
03:08:02,010 --> 03:08:02,210
World Edge.

5005
03:08:04,830 --> 03:08:07,610
We don't have to try hard cop this.

5006
03:08:07,690 --> 03:08:08,010
We don't have to try hard cop this.

5007
03:08:08,030 --> 03:08:10,070
I mean they're literally all bots.

5008
03:08:12,670 --> 03:08:14,070
Alright let's see.

5009
03:08:14,110 --> 03:08:15,270
Let's see this real...

5010
03:08:15,270 --> 03:08:16,930
This very real person.

5011
03:08:17,250 --> 03:08:18,530
Oh yeah that's not real.

5012
03:08:21,170 --> 03:08:22,510
There's no way.

5013
03:08:23,690 --> 03:08:26,890
Someone was like did your command line ruin the queuing system?

5014
03:08:27,150 --> 03:08:28,590
That should not be possible.

5015
03:08:29,150 --> 03:08:32,370
How would command lines ruin a queue?

5016
03:08:32,670 --> 03:08:34,910
Like destroy a queue.

5017
03:08:35,550 --> 03:08:36,190
How?

5018
03:08:36,510 --> 03:08:38,010
Did I just get into an easy mode?

5019
03:08:38,010 --> 03:08:38,330
Is this a PC lobby?

5020
03:08:39,950 --> 03:08:40,430
Probably.

5021
03:08:41,850 --> 03:08:42,330
Wait.

5022
03:08:43,610 --> 03:08:44,090
Probably.

5023
03:08:44,230 --> 03:08:44,850
I don't know.

5024
03:08:44,970 --> 03:08:46,150
Okay we're leaving bot 5.

5025
03:08:46,970 --> 03:08:49,670
We're gonna kill one team and then we're leaving bot royale.

5026
03:08:49,830 --> 03:08:51,150
And then we're gonna see if that's true.

5027
03:08:52,450 --> 03:08:53,890
There is a way.

5028
03:08:54,010 --> 03:08:55,410
Guys there's actually a way.

5029
03:08:55,730 --> 03:08:56,430
Because like...

5030
03:08:58,310 --> 03:09:00,570
Because like back there was a command line.

5031
03:09:00,670 --> 03:09:01,570
Where you can like...

5032
03:09:01,570 --> 03:09:03,990
Force a PC lobby.

5033
03:09:05,030 --> 03:09:05,990
Without like...

5034
03:09:05,990 --> 03:09:07,310
Jesus Christ.

5035
03:09:08,010 --> 03:09:10,490
They're so good at fucking defending their shields.

5036
03:09:10,690 --> 03:09:11,230
That's...

5037
03:09:11,890 --> 03:09:12,490
Like...

5038
03:09:14,370 --> 03:09:18,070
Literally this bot was so good at making sure I don't shoot him.

5039
03:09:18,110 --> 03:09:19,390
When he put up his shield.

5040
03:09:21,110 --> 03:09:22,070
Oh shit.

5041
03:09:22,150 --> 03:09:22,690
What the fuck?

5042
03:09:23,050 --> 03:09:23,650
Hello.

5043
03:09:24,490 --> 03:09:25,390
Oh my god.

5044
03:09:25,630 --> 03:09:27,890
Give me my fucking shield back you...

5045
03:09:27,890 --> 03:09:28,370
No!

5046
03:09:31,210 --> 03:09:33,190
It's so goofy I swear.

5047
03:09:33,510 --> 03:09:34,250
Oh my god.

5048
03:09:34,290 --> 03:09:36,350
Bots have zero ping.

5049
03:09:38,010 --> 03:09:39,610
Okay yeah it's definitely not the map.

5050
03:09:39,810 --> 03:09:42,330
It's my RAM issue I'm pretty sure.

5051
03:09:42,610 --> 03:09:44,670
It's in my RAM A and D.

5052
03:09:44,850 --> 03:09:46,050
I'm just gonna get new RAM.

5053
03:09:46,250 --> 03:09:46,630
Fuck it.

5054
03:09:46,630 --> 03:09:47,190
Get more RAM.

5055
03:09:47,650 --> 03:09:49,310
But it has to be the same RAM right?

5056
03:09:50,290 --> 03:09:51,070
That's like...

5057
03:09:51,070 --> 03:09:51,930
Well...

5058
03:09:52,490 --> 03:09:54,130
It's safer to be the same yes.

5059
03:09:54,190 --> 03:09:54,590
Yeah yeah.

5060
03:09:54,790 --> 03:09:57,530
Alright are you ready to leave and fucking try again?

5061
03:09:57,690 --> 03:09:59,170
I shot my gun I'm satisfied.

5062
03:09:59,650 --> 03:10:00,750
I can wait longer.

5063
03:10:00,790 --> 03:10:03,790
Honestly my FPS is also like 150 for some fucking reason.

5064
03:10:03,950 --> 03:10:04,390
That's weird.

5065
03:10:05,830 --> 03:10:07,350
Did they just break the game?

5066
03:10:08,190 --> 03:10:11,310
AMD is the best with only one stick?

5067
03:10:11,870 --> 03:10:12,610
RAM issue.

5068
03:10:12,610 --> 03:10:13,030
No it's not.

5069
03:10:13,170 --> 03:10:13,930
Wait what?

5070
03:10:14,030 --> 03:10:15,450
That's what somebody in my chat said.

5071
03:10:15,830 --> 03:10:16,190
What?

5072
03:10:16,370 --> 03:10:17,610
Oh they deleted their message.

5073
03:10:18,690 --> 03:10:20,790
Yeah yeah I was like what?

5074
03:10:21,110 --> 03:10:23,790
No wait someone said AMD isn't stable with four sticks.

5075
03:10:24,230 --> 03:10:25,190
That's what they say.

5076
03:10:25,510 --> 03:10:26,050
It's not.

5077
03:10:27,050 --> 03:10:28,150
Kind of not.

5078
03:10:29,990 --> 03:10:31,530
I have four sticks in there.

5079
03:10:32,670 --> 03:10:33,230
Eww.

5080
03:10:34,430 --> 03:10:37,390
Someone said two 32 gigabyte sticks.

5081
03:10:38,110 --> 03:10:39,210
That's what they said.

5082
03:10:40,590 --> 03:10:41,130
Eww.

5083
03:10:42,130 --> 03:10:43,110
Yeah that's what...

5084
03:10:43,110 --> 03:10:45,290
Wait there's no revival in my game?

5085
03:10:45,510 --> 03:10:46,790
Did they remove revival?

5086
03:10:49,390 --> 03:10:49,930
What?

5087
03:10:50,030 --> 03:10:50,270
Revival?

5088
03:10:50,550 --> 03:10:51,650
They can do that?

5089
03:10:52,850 --> 03:10:53,390
How?

5090
03:10:53,890 --> 03:10:55,070
They can do that?

5091
03:10:55,290 --> 03:10:56,250
Okay we're leaving.

5092
03:10:56,510 --> 03:10:57,570
I'm so confused.

5093
03:10:57,830 --> 03:10:58,610
We're leaving?

5094
03:10:59,330 --> 03:11:01,210
Then why are you still moving?

5095
03:11:01,750 --> 03:11:03,550
Because like now I'm leaving.

5096
03:11:04,630 --> 03:11:05,510
Now I'm...

5097
03:11:05,510 --> 03:11:06,010
Uh huh.

5098
03:11:08,330 --> 03:11:10,050
You just turned into a box.

5099
03:11:10,190 --> 03:11:10,870
Wait what?

5100
03:11:11,030 --> 03:11:12,010
There's still revival!

5101
03:11:12,430 --> 03:11:14,310
Somebody was like there's no revival anymore.

5102
03:11:14,510 --> 03:11:16,970
But there's still revival in my fucking thing!

5103
03:11:17,910 --> 03:11:18,830
Alright queue up.

5104
03:11:19,070 --> 03:11:21,290
What are you guys talking about?

5105
03:11:21,550 --> 03:11:22,710
There's revival here!

5106
03:11:23,350 --> 03:11:24,990
You guys are big liars.

5107
03:11:25,250 --> 03:11:26,250
Big big liars.

5108
03:11:26,470 --> 03:11:27,470
You know what I'll go...

5109
03:11:27,470 --> 03:11:27,870
Oh we got in.

5110
03:11:27,950 --> 03:11:28,310
Okay let's go.

5111
03:11:28,850 --> 03:11:29,450
We're in.

5112
03:11:29,630 --> 03:11:30,110
That's fine.

5113
03:11:30,370 --> 03:11:31,170
We fixed it.

5114
03:11:31,170 --> 03:11:33,330
We just had to...

5115
03:11:33,330 --> 03:11:33,890
Uh...

5116
03:11:34,730 --> 03:11:35,990
Yeah they removed it.

5117
03:11:36,090 --> 03:11:36,990
Then what am I in?

5118
03:11:38,210 --> 03:11:39,870
Then why are we even like...

5119
03:11:39,870 --> 03:11:41,150
What am I in?

5120
03:11:41,410 --> 03:11:44,470
Somebody super chatty said like...

5121
03:11:44,470 --> 03:11:45,390
Yeah they removed it.

5122
03:11:45,510 --> 03:11:46,350
What am I in?

5123
03:11:47,090 --> 03:11:47,810
Big liars.

5124
03:11:47,810 --> 03:11:49,530
Big liars.

5125
03:11:52,070 --> 03:11:53,330
Where am I?

5126
03:11:53,650 --> 03:11:54,810
Where am I?

5127
03:11:57,190 --> 03:11:58,930
What is going on?

5128
03:11:59,250 --> 03:12:00,430
It's called launch day.

5129
03:12:01,170 --> 03:12:02,970
It's called Apex Legends launch day.

5130
03:12:05,130 --> 03:12:06,570
How the fuck?

5131
03:12:07,390 --> 03:12:08,650
Where are we?

5132
03:12:09,270 --> 03:12:11,350
Are we in the matrix?

5133
03:12:11,510 --> 03:12:12,810
Where the fuck are we?

5134
03:12:15,170 --> 03:12:15,850
Alright.

5135
03:12:15,910 --> 03:12:17,870
Are you playing Mirage?

5136
03:12:19,110 --> 03:12:19,790
Alright.

5137
03:12:19,930 --> 03:12:21,250
I'm gonna play...

5138
03:12:21,250 --> 03:12:22,430
I'm gonna play crypto.

5139
03:12:23,870 --> 03:12:25,570
I'm going off the grid again.

5140
03:12:27,190 --> 03:12:28,690
What is reality?

5141
03:12:29,030 --> 03:12:29,630
Where's that guy?

5142
03:12:29,730 --> 03:12:30,990
Super chat explain this.

5143
03:12:31,170 --> 03:12:32,310
Explain this.

5144
03:12:40,880 --> 03:12:43,440
Now they removed my trios.

5145
03:12:43,500 --> 03:12:44,560
What the fuck?

5146
03:12:45,660 --> 03:12:48,520
You were the one that got your trios removed.

5147
03:12:48,740 --> 03:12:49,340
Not me.

5148
03:12:52,900 --> 03:12:53,920
Oh yeah we won.

5149
03:12:53,960 --> 03:12:55,100
You were the issue.

5150
03:12:56,520 --> 03:12:58,180
You were the issue.

5151
03:12:58,340 --> 03:12:59,480
You were the issue.

5152
03:13:01,800 --> 03:13:02,360
Alright.

5153
03:13:03,080 --> 03:13:04,020
We're back in.

5154
03:13:04,700 --> 03:13:06,940
Apparently they said to try a new command line.

5155
03:13:07,100 --> 03:13:09,340
So I'm gonna try a new command line after this game.

5156
03:13:09,340 --> 03:13:10,320
Try a new command line?

5157
03:13:10,500 --> 03:13:10,760
Yeah.

5158
03:13:11,400 --> 03:13:13,860
We're gonna keep trying command lines.

5159
03:13:14,040 --> 03:13:15,600
Until we prove forces.

5160
03:13:15,600 --> 03:13:16,120
You know what?

5161
03:13:16,320 --> 03:13:17,920
Maybe I should too.

5162
03:13:19,200 --> 03:13:22,400
Because probably getting 150 in Apex is not...

5163
03:13:22,400 --> 03:13:23,200
Probably.

5164
03:13:23,200 --> 03:13:26,600
My FPS decreases when I upgrade my graphics card.

5165
03:13:26,720 --> 03:13:26,860
Probably.

5166
03:13:26,860 --> 03:13:29,080
I don't think that's a normal thing.

5167
03:13:30,200 --> 03:13:32,000
Something will work eventually.

5168
03:13:32,900 --> 03:13:34,900
Something will work eventually.

5169
03:13:36,920 --> 03:13:37,440
Probably.

5170
03:13:37,440 --> 03:13:38,200
Not even...

5171
03:13:38,200 --> 03:13:39,200
That's not even me.

5172
03:13:42,640 --> 03:13:43,460
Why here?

5173
03:13:43,840 --> 03:13:45,840
Oh they're like nearly next to me.

5174
03:13:46,060 --> 03:13:47,200
Oh they're like nearly next to me.

5175
03:13:47,220 --> 03:13:48,160
They're hinging nearly.

5176
03:13:49,720 --> 03:13:50,900
Are you fighting already?

5177
03:13:51,120 --> 03:13:51,980
Yes I am.

5178
03:13:52,020 --> 03:13:53,040
I'm fucking coming back though.

5179
03:13:53,120 --> 03:13:54,140
Because he has a team.

5180
03:13:54,740 --> 03:13:55,260
Woah.

5181
03:13:57,760 --> 03:13:58,280
Woah.

5182
03:13:58,440 --> 03:13:59,740
I got the rampart though.

5183
03:13:59,740 --> 03:13:59,900
Hello?

5184
03:14:03,920 --> 03:14:05,340
Go drone go!

5185
03:14:06,240 --> 03:14:07,080
Not even me.

5186
03:14:07,260 --> 03:14:07,620
Go Nikoi go!

5187
03:14:09,360 --> 03:14:09,640
Man.

5188
03:14:12,160 --> 03:14:13,260
Enemies are respawning?

5189
03:14:13,380 --> 03:14:14,780
I didn't even kill anybody yet.

5190
03:14:16,600 --> 03:14:17,120
Alright.

5191
03:14:17,220 --> 03:14:18,140
I'm coming over now.

5192
03:14:22,150 --> 03:14:22,670
Alright.

5193
03:14:22,710 --> 03:14:23,470
Right here.

5194
03:14:24,070 --> 03:14:25,310
There's a Venture coming in.

5195
03:14:25,350 --> 03:14:25,730
There's a Venture.

5196
03:14:28,370 --> 03:14:29,050
Where is he?

5197
03:14:31,150 --> 03:14:31,670
What?

5198
03:14:32,090 --> 03:14:33,390
Do you even have a gun?

5199
03:14:33,530 --> 03:14:34,830
What the fuck is wrong with you?

5200
03:14:36,050 --> 03:14:36,570
Alright.

5201
03:14:37,890 --> 03:14:38,790
You're down one.

5202
03:14:39,070 --> 03:14:39,770
You're down two.

5203
03:14:40,130 --> 03:14:40,950
Don't worry I got you!

5204
03:14:41,230 --> 03:14:42,150
Wait you're not him.

5205
03:14:46,060 --> 03:14:46,580
Alright.

5206
03:14:46,760 --> 03:14:48,260
I need to grab some...

5207
03:14:48,260 --> 03:14:50,100
I need to grab some ammo.

5208
03:14:50,220 --> 03:14:51,040
I have zero ammo.

5209
03:14:52,140 --> 03:14:53,620
How do you have zero ammo?

5210
03:14:53,960 --> 03:14:54,680
Like my...

5211
03:14:54,680 --> 03:14:56,100
Because I shot people.

5212
03:14:57,400 --> 03:14:59,440
Because you shot people and didn't kill them.

5213
03:14:59,440 --> 03:15:00,280
What do you think?

5214
03:15:01,140 --> 03:15:03,080
Yeah they don't have my ammo!

5215
03:15:04,000 --> 03:15:04,700
You know what?

5216
03:15:04,700 --> 03:15:05,040
Fuck you.

5217
03:15:05,280 --> 03:15:05,700
I'm going off the grid.

5218
03:15:05,860 --> 03:15:06,520
I'll need you.

5219
03:15:07,140 --> 03:15:07,660
What?

5220
03:15:10,080 --> 03:15:10,940
Fuck you.

5221
03:15:12,980 --> 03:15:15,660
Because of what you said I'm going off the grid now.

5222
03:15:15,820 --> 03:15:16,300
Good luck.

5223
03:15:18,000 --> 03:15:18,080
What?

5224
03:15:19,500 --> 03:15:20,360
Good luck.

5225
03:15:21,200 --> 03:15:23,980
I'm burning off my fingerprints and deleting my passports.

5226
03:15:26,480 --> 03:15:27,000
Where?

5227
03:15:28,620 --> 03:15:29,560
There's people here.

5228
03:15:29,880 --> 03:15:30,880
There's people here.

5229
03:15:31,580 --> 03:15:32,900
Hey there buddy.

5230
03:15:33,120 --> 03:15:33,440
Hey.

5231
03:15:37,960 --> 03:15:38,520
Hey there.

5232
03:15:38,880 --> 03:15:39,820
Am I shooting your drones?

5233
03:15:40,100 --> 03:15:40,600
No.

5234
03:15:45,180 --> 03:15:45,740
Alright.

5235
03:15:50,520 --> 03:15:51,640
Alright exit.

5236
03:15:53,280 --> 03:15:54,620
I'm coming back now.

5237
03:15:55,460 --> 03:15:56,860
That's not mine by the way.

5238
03:15:57,060 --> 03:15:58,360
Bro is so blind.

5239
03:16:01,020 --> 03:16:02,120
Where are you?

5240
03:16:02,120 --> 03:16:03,400
Just one second late.

5241
03:16:04,940 --> 03:16:05,680
Oh god.

5242
03:16:05,860 --> 03:16:06,840
I'm going off the grid.

5243
03:16:10,360 --> 03:16:11,320
Oh shit!

5244
03:16:12,520 --> 03:16:14,340
They broke my fucking...

5245
03:16:14,340 --> 03:16:15,320
Wait that's you.

5246
03:16:15,540 --> 03:16:16,140
It's me.

5247
03:16:18,740 --> 03:16:19,760
I don't even know...

5248
03:16:19,760 --> 03:16:20,140
What?

5249
03:16:22,380 --> 03:16:23,260
What do you mean?

5250
03:16:25,120 --> 03:16:25,600
Fucking...

5251
03:16:25,600 --> 03:16:26,100
Wow!

5252
03:16:26,560 --> 03:16:27,460
There's so many people.

5253
03:16:27,520 --> 03:16:28,240
There's a lot of people.

5254
03:16:28,340 --> 03:16:29,600
You should... I'm leaving.

5255
03:16:30,960 --> 03:16:32,060
I should what?

5256
03:16:32,120 --> 03:16:33,380
You should leave.

5257
03:16:34,220 --> 03:16:35,000
There's a lot.

5258
03:16:35,080 --> 03:16:36,180
There's a new team coming in.

5259
03:16:36,240 --> 03:16:37,060
There's a new team coming in.

5260
03:16:39,080 --> 03:16:39,680
Don't worry.

5261
03:16:40,700 --> 03:16:41,800
Off the grid time.

5262
03:16:43,100 --> 03:16:43,580
Sure.

5263
03:16:43,780 --> 03:16:44,520
Off the grid.

5264
03:16:46,720 --> 03:16:47,200
Don't worry.

5265
03:16:47,200 --> 03:16:47,740
I'm contributing!

5266
03:16:48,400 --> 03:16:49,240
They're right here.

5267
03:16:50,480 --> 03:16:51,200
You know...

5268
03:16:51,200 --> 03:16:53,260
Fuck these guys in particular.

5269
03:16:54,900 --> 03:16:56,520
They're up here by the way.

5270
03:16:56,520 --> 03:16:59,580
They don't know.

5271
03:17:00,500 --> 03:17:01,380
They don't know.

5272
03:17:01,480 --> 03:17:02,640
Oh that guy is super low.

5273
03:17:03,940 --> 03:17:04,480
I'm fine.

5274
03:17:06,800 --> 03:17:07,680
There's people in front of me.

5275
03:17:07,800 --> 03:17:08,440
There's people in front of me.

5276
03:17:08,900 --> 03:17:09,300
No!

5277
03:17:10,840 --> 03:17:12,680
They saw me before I disappeared.

5278
03:17:13,500 --> 03:17:15,060
What happened to your eye for the grid?

5279
03:17:15,460 --> 03:17:16,680
They saw me.

5280
03:17:16,980 --> 03:17:19,480
I came back to visit relatives.

5281
03:17:20,000 --> 03:17:22,320
And they caught me at the border control.

5282
03:17:22,840 --> 03:17:24,160
They caught me at the border.

5283
03:17:29,880 --> 03:17:30,680
I'm back.

5284
03:17:31,600 --> 03:17:32,960
I knew it.

5285
03:17:32,980 --> 03:17:34,160
I should have never came back.

5286
03:17:35,040 --> 03:17:37,500
Family is dead to me after I go off the grid.

5287
03:17:42,920 --> 03:17:45,880
My fucking 10 passports didn't work.

5288
03:17:48,760 --> 03:17:49,280
Alright.

5289
03:17:51,020 --> 03:17:52,380
I'm going on the other side.

5290
03:17:55,420 --> 03:17:57,980
There is like a guy next to me.

5291
03:18:02,040 --> 03:18:03,920
I can't see you guys from here.

5292
03:18:04,020 --> 03:18:04,720
There's another squad.

5293
03:18:04,820 --> 03:18:05,260
Hailna.

5294
03:18:05,640 --> 03:18:06,180
Is there?

5295
03:18:07,520 --> 03:18:07,960
Yep.

5296
03:18:08,520 --> 03:18:09,180
I'm here.

5297
03:18:11,220 --> 03:18:12,100
Where are they?

5298
03:18:12,560 --> 03:18:14,080
Well, I ain't fighting that.

5299
03:18:18,610 --> 03:18:19,050
Where?

5300
03:18:21,110 --> 03:18:21,910
Oh shit!

5301
03:18:21,990 --> 03:18:22,550
Don't fight that!

5302
03:18:24,590 --> 03:18:25,670
That's what I'm talking about.

5303
03:18:28,550 --> 03:18:29,430
Three squads?

5304
03:18:29,430 --> 03:18:29,650
Three squads?

5305
03:18:29,650 --> 03:18:30,050
Okay.

5306
03:18:31,810 --> 03:18:32,230
There's three squads.

5307
03:18:32,270 --> 03:18:33,710
Don't leave it.

5308
03:18:33,790 --> 03:18:34,170
You have to.

5309
03:18:36,570 --> 03:18:37,130
Oh shit!

5310
03:18:37,170 --> 03:18:37,850
You guys are doing stuff.

5311
03:18:38,890 --> 03:18:39,570
Wait, are they dead?

5312
03:18:42,430 --> 03:18:43,370
I'm going to scout.

5313
03:18:43,630 --> 03:18:44,310
Yeah, they're all dead.

5314
03:18:46,690 --> 03:18:47,490
Oh no, no, no!

5315
03:18:47,490 --> 03:18:47,930
Right here, right here!

5316
03:18:48,690 --> 03:18:49,470
They're on my side.

5317
03:18:52,590 --> 03:18:53,650
Somebody is taking zip.

5318
03:18:54,370 --> 03:18:55,530
They ran off.

5319
03:18:55,710 --> 03:18:56,110
They ran off.

5320
03:18:58,190 --> 03:18:59,150
Alright, I'm going to loot.

5321
03:18:59,250 --> 03:19:00,770
Where's the other Mozambique, bro?

5322
03:19:01,810 --> 03:19:02,170
Damn!

5323
03:19:03,510 --> 03:19:05,430
I need like another P20.

5324
03:19:06,670 --> 03:19:08,230
I need another Mozambique.

5325
03:19:08,610 --> 03:19:10,090
Did you kill one guy only?

5326
03:19:11,150 --> 03:19:12,950
I killed like seven.

5327
03:19:13,730 --> 03:19:15,830
I'm going to get rid of these then.

5328
03:19:16,550 --> 03:19:17,110
I'm going to get rid of these then.

5329
03:19:18,230 --> 03:19:19,330
Oh my god.

5330
03:19:19,710 --> 03:19:20,790
I'm going to heal up them.

5331
03:19:21,730 --> 03:19:22,290
I'm going to heal up them.

5332
03:19:23,230 --> 03:19:23,790
Okay.

5333
03:19:25,830 --> 03:19:26,950
Oh, on me.

5334
03:19:27,150 --> 03:19:27,250
Oh, on me.

5335
03:19:27,490 --> 03:19:28,170
I'm going to kill them.

5336
03:19:28,170 --> 03:19:28,570
I'm going to kill them.

5337
03:19:35,940 --> 03:19:36,660
Oh shit!

5338
03:19:36,660 --> 03:19:36,940
Oh, that's the bitch.

5339
03:19:37,180 --> 03:19:37,780
Yeah, that's him.

5340
03:19:37,880 --> 03:19:38,460
Oh, you got him!

5341
03:19:43,060 --> 03:19:43,780
Flash, flash, flash!

5342
03:19:43,860 --> 03:19:44,100
He's one.

5343
03:19:44,100 --> 03:19:44,620
He's literally one.

5344
03:19:44,700 --> 03:19:45,140
He's literally one.

5345
03:19:46,140 --> 03:19:46,680
Punch him!

5346
03:19:46,820 --> 03:19:47,860
Yeah, I told you.

5347
03:19:48,520 --> 03:19:49,340
I need his loot.

5348
03:19:50,760 --> 03:19:52,280
Did they have a fucking Mozambique?

5349
03:19:52,560 --> 03:19:53,340
Wait, where did he go?

5350
03:19:53,560 --> 03:19:54,500
Where did the body go?

5351
03:19:55,700 --> 03:19:56,600
I don't know.

5352
03:19:56,640 --> 03:19:57,580
I thought he dropped down.

5353
03:19:57,940 --> 03:19:58,580
I see it.

5354
03:19:58,680 --> 03:19:59,100
I see it.

5355
03:19:59,580 --> 03:20:00,560
Oh, he's down there?

5356
03:20:00,740 --> 03:20:01,560
Yeah, he's right there.

5357
03:20:01,560 --> 03:20:02,520
What about the other one?

5358
03:20:02,680 --> 03:20:03,680
I don't fucking know.

5359
03:20:03,940 --> 03:20:05,080
I need to find...

5360
03:20:05,080 --> 03:20:07,720
Oh, I got... I got double...

5361
03:20:07,720 --> 03:20:09,820
I got double P20s.

5362
03:20:09,820 --> 03:20:10,860
You got double Mozambique.

5363
03:20:10,860 --> 03:20:11,420
We got this.

5364
03:20:12,620 --> 03:20:13,140
Okay.

5365
03:20:14,060 --> 03:20:14,580
Uh...

5366
03:20:17,420 --> 03:20:17,940
Alright.

5367
03:20:18,160 --> 03:20:19,180
You need double Mozambique.

5368
03:20:19,640 --> 03:20:21,880
I'll find... I'll ping you a Mozambique when I see one.

5369
03:20:22,480 --> 03:20:23,320
Sure, sure, sure.

5370
03:20:24,860 --> 03:20:25,380
Uh...

5371
03:20:25,380 --> 03:20:27,660
Is there anybody here?

5372
03:20:29,800 --> 03:20:30,620
One squad?

5373
03:20:31,800 --> 03:20:33,360
Where is this one squad?

5374
03:20:35,500 --> 03:20:36,880
They said there's a squad here.

5375
03:20:39,000 --> 03:20:39,400
Hello?

5376
03:20:41,520 --> 03:20:41,920
Hello?

5377
03:20:42,960 --> 03:20:47,060
It's like... It's like the whole drone range, basically.

5378
03:20:47,560 --> 03:20:48,720
Oh, they're on the other side.

5379
03:20:48,920 --> 03:20:49,800
They're on the other side.

5380
03:20:50,800 --> 03:20:51,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5381
03:20:54,020 --> 03:20:55,240
Um... Do you have any shield cells?

5382
03:20:55,420 --> 03:20:55,920
I have zero.

5383
03:20:56,520 --> 03:20:57,340
I have three.

5384
03:20:59,620 --> 03:21:00,700
That's not even a battery.

5385
03:21:00,740 --> 03:21:01,340
It's a cell.

5386
03:21:02,140 --> 03:21:02,580
Alright.

5387
03:21:02,760 --> 03:21:04,540
This is a little awkward.

5388
03:21:05,240 --> 03:21:05,680
Oh!

5389
03:21:06,940 --> 03:21:07,820
Very, very awkward.

5390
03:21:07,980 --> 03:21:08,800
I found some cells.

5391
03:21:09,120 --> 03:21:09,960
Get over here.

5392
03:21:10,320 --> 03:21:10,500
Okay.

5393
03:21:11,980 --> 03:21:12,740
I'm heading over.

5394
03:21:13,100 --> 03:21:14,340
There's like teams to our left.

5395
03:21:15,140 --> 03:21:15,580
Yeah.

5396
03:21:16,020 --> 03:21:16,700
And a right.

5397
03:21:16,780 --> 03:21:17,500
And that one guy.

5398
03:21:18,260 --> 03:21:21,860
Yeah, but he can't be a solo because, you know, this is...

5399
03:21:21,860 --> 03:21:23,100
They could leave.

5400
03:21:23,540 --> 03:21:24,460
Oh, that's true.

5401
03:21:24,640 --> 03:21:25,680
They could be assholes.

5402
03:21:27,280 --> 03:21:29,540
Yeah, like no one wants to play with you.

5403
03:21:30,400 --> 03:21:30,840
There.

5404
03:21:30,980 --> 03:21:31,140
Here.

5405
03:21:31,720 --> 03:21:32,940
You have no friends.

5406
03:21:32,960 --> 03:21:33,900
That's so sad.

5407
03:21:35,020 --> 03:21:35,500
Nice.

5408
03:21:35,520 --> 03:21:36,780
You have no friends.

5409
03:21:37,280 --> 03:21:37,760
Alright.

5410
03:21:37,900 --> 03:21:38,360
Where are we?

5411
03:21:38,580 --> 03:21:38,800
What?

5412
03:21:38,880 --> 03:21:39,800
There was people here.

5413
03:21:42,140 --> 03:21:42,880
Where are they?

5414
03:21:43,940 --> 03:21:44,680
Where are they?

5415
03:21:46,020 --> 03:21:46,660
Over here.

5416
03:21:48,780 --> 03:21:49,640
I hear them.

5417
03:21:49,940 --> 03:21:50,420
Shh.

5418
03:21:52,360 --> 03:21:53,340
They're on me?

5419
03:21:53,600 --> 03:21:54,580
Oh, that's a huge car.

5420
03:21:54,740 --> 03:21:55,200
The fuck?

5421
03:21:56,280 --> 03:21:56,760
Oop.

5422
03:21:56,780 --> 03:21:57,420
Not here.

5423
03:22:00,420 --> 03:22:00,900
Alright.

5424
03:22:01,560 --> 03:22:02,240
Don't worry.

5425
03:22:04,980 --> 03:22:05,580
Connecting?

5426
03:22:06,820 --> 03:22:07,740
Holy shit.

5427
03:22:07,800 --> 03:22:08,520
That is invisible.

5428
03:22:08,780 --> 03:22:09,560
Over here.

5429
03:22:11,880 --> 03:22:12,800
I see them.

5430
03:22:16,280 --> 03:22:17,300
It's right here.

5431
03:22:17,660 --> 03:22:18,260
Damn.

5432
03:22:18,380 --> 03:22:20,620
Shooting people from this distance and this...

5433
03:22:20,620 --> 03:22:21,480
What the fuck?

5434
03:22:21,540 --> 03:22:22,640
What the fuck?

5435
03:22:22,640 --> 03:22:23,040
I see!

5436
03:22:23,720 --> 03:22:25,020
Oh my god.

5437
03:22:25,040 --> 03:22:29,040
I got back to see the flame around me.

5438
03:22:31,220 --> 03:22:33,020
That's actually so fucked.

5439
03:22:34,380 --> 03:22:35,880
My... my bat.

5440
03:22:39,520 --> 03:22:40,080
Alright.

5441
03:22:41,100 --> 03:22:42,680
Our guy is moving fast.

5442
03:22:43,120 --> 03:22:43,860
Oh my god.

5443
03:22:43,880 --> 03:22:44,460
He's already there.

5444
03:22:44,880 --> 03:22:45,600
Mm-hmm.

5445
03:22:46,140 --> 03:22:46,700
Okay.

5446
03:22:47,420 --> 03:22:48,700
I'm gonna do something crazy.

5447
03:22:54,220 --> 03:22:55,340
Stupid mosquitoes.

5448
03:22:56,140 --> 03:22:56,700
Pew!

5449
03:22:56,800 --> 03:22:57,460
There you go.

5450
03:22:57,520 --> 03:22:57,880
They're all low.

5451
03:22:58,020 --> 03:22:59,020
They're all low.

5452
03:22:59,700 --> 03:23:00,380
I'm back.

5453
03:23:01,660 --> 03:23:03,140
They're all so low.

5454
03:23:03,340 --> 03:23:04,580
I did my job.

5455
03:23:05,260 --> 03:23:06,320
Are they all dead?

5456
03:23:07,500 --> 03:23:08,260
Wait.

5457
03:23:08,340 --> 03:23:09,020
They're all dead.

5458
03:23:10,220 --> 03:23:11,360
Holy shit.

5459
03:23:11,380 --> 03:23:11,880
That was fast.

5460
03:23:12,640 --> 03:23:14,040
Oh my god!

5461
03:23:14,100 --> 03:23:15,820
Gold dual pistols?

5462
03:23:17,080 --> 03:23:17,840
Wow!

5463
03:23:18,000 --> 03:23:18,760
Chill!

5464
03:23:22,220 --> 03:23:23,300
Not me.

5465
03:23:25,140 --> 03:23:26,660
Not me.

5466
03:23:26,840 --> 03:23:27,520
Right here.

5467
03:23:33,000 --> 03:23:33,800
Holy shit.

5468
03:23:33,820 --> 03:23:34,240
That's a lot.

5469
03:23:36,460 --> 03:23:36,980
They're right.

5470
03:23:41,480 --> 03:23:42,260
Oh my god.

5471
03:23:42,260 --> 03:23:43,000
He's literally one.

5472
03:23:43,480 --> 03:23:44,580
Did you get the bloodhound?

5473
03:23:46,060 --> 03:23:46,460
Yeah.

5474
03:23:46,460 --> 03:23:46,940
I got the bloodhound.

5475
03:23:47,040 --> 03:23:47,240
Okay.

5476
03:23:48,240 --> 03:23:48,980
I got him.

5477
03:23:49,880 --> 03:23:50,680
Where's the last guy?

5478
03:23:52,120 --> 03:23:53,800
He's at the corner where my decoy is.

5479
03:23:53,840 --> 03:23:54,040
I don't know.

5480
03:23:54,120 --> 03:23:54,800
He's in smoke.

5481
03:23:54,880 --> 03:23:55,140
He's in smoke.

5482
03:23:56,700 --> 03:23:57,220
You ping?

5483
03:24:00,220 --> 03:24:01,140
Oh there he is.

5484
03:24:01,560 --> 03:24:02,420
Bro this guy.

5485
03:24:02,760 --> 03:24:03,780
I'm coming over.

5486
03:24:03,960 --> 03:24:04,700
I'm coming over.

5487
03:24:04,740 --> 03:24:06,020
Bro this guy ain't raising me.

5488
03:24:06,160 --> 03:24:08,000
He's just...

5489
03:24:08,560 --> 03:24:09,940
He's fucking running his zone.

5490
03:24:10,200 --> 03:24:11,580
That's fucking crazy.

5491
03:24:14,000 --> 03:24:15,200
He can't live there.

5492
03:24:15,840 --> 03:24:16,660
He'll die.

5493
03:24:18,380 --> 03:24:19,880
Is he still alive in there?

5494
03:24:20,860 --> 03:24:21,540
Kind of.

5495
03:24:22,120 --> 03:24:23,660
How is he still alive?

5496
03:24:24,940 --> 03:24:26,380
There's no way.

5497
03:24:27,740 --> 03:24:28,740
He shan't be.

5498
03:24:28,960 --> 03:24:30,140
He actually...

5499
03:24:30,140 --> 03:24:31,120
Oh my god.

5500
03:24:31,160 --> 03:24:32,640
He actually lived long enough for...

5501
03:24:32,760 --> 03:24:33,160
He's dead.

5502
03:24:33,300 --> 03:24:36,910
He actually lived long enough just for the respawn.

5503
03:24:37,680 --> 03:24:38,900
That's actually crazy.

5504
03:24:39,940 --> 03:24:40,980
He did that.

5505
03:24:41,960 --> 03:24:42,820
That bitch.

5506
03:24:43,660 --> 03:24:46,060
Is there no second Mozambique?

5507
03:24:46,160 --> 03:24:46,820
Holy shit.

5508
03:24:46,820 --> 03:24:47,440
I have not seen it.

5509
03:24:47,500 --> 03:24:48,700
I don't think anybody is running it.

5510
03:24:48,920 --> 03:24:52,340
I am soloing people with like one singular Mozambique.

5511
03:24:52,340 --> 03:24:53,740
I found a lot of shotgun ammo.

5512
03:24:54,340 --> 03:24:54,400
I found a lot of shotgun ammo.

5513
03:24:54,960 --> 03:24:56,020
Oh they dropped down.

5514
03:24:56,280 --> 03:24:56,780
Yeah.

5515
03:24:56,840 --> 03:24:57,740
They dropped that way.

5516
03:24:57,820 --> 03:24:58,700
That's the team earlier.

5517
03:24:58,700 --> 03:24:59,640
Right.

5518
03:25:00,820 --> 03:25:04,140
I can't believe my fucking rat lived for that long.

5519
03:25:04,540 --> 03:25:04,940
I can't believe my fucking rat lived for that long.

5520
03:25:07,300 --> 03:25:08,280
Can you recall?

5521
03:25:10,720 --> 03:25:12,760
Get in zone and then I can...

5522
03:25:13,340 --> 03:25:14,160
do stuff.

5523
03:25:14,940 --> 03:25:15,620
On me?

5524
03:25:17,240 --> 03:25:17,880
Right here?

5525
03:25:17,920 --> 03:25:18,300
Crypto?

5526
03:25:21,100 --> 03:25:22,340
He's right in front of us.

5527
03:25:22,500 --> 03:25:24,160
Oh but like... Oh shit!

5528
03:25:24,200 --> 03:25:24,460
You okay?

5529
03:25:25,700 --> 03:25:27,000
Our guy is not okay.

5530
03:25:27,460 --> 03:25:27,540
Our guy is not okay.

5531
03:25:30,380 --> 03:25:30,900
Damn.

5532
03:25:30,900 --> 03:25:32,060
I'm not disappearing.

5533
03:25:32,100 --> 03:25:32,700
They are fucking in.

5534
03:25:32,800 --> 03:25:33,900
Oh it's just lifeline.

5535
03:25:37,680 --> 03:25:38,200
No!

5536
03:25:40,040 --> 03:25:40,560
No!

5537
03:25:40,560 --> 03:25:41,240
I'm dead.

5538
03:25:41,340 --> 03:25:41,640
I'm dead.

5539
03:25:44,460 --> 03:25:45,640
No I'm so dead.

5540
03:25:45,800 --> 03:25:45,880
No!

5541
03:25:46,380 --> 03:25:47,860
I wanted to disappear!

5542
03:25:48,080 --> 03:25:50,280
I couldn't disappear!

5543
03:25:52,600 --> 03:25:53,640
I couldn't!

5544
03:25:53,740 --> 03:25:54,260
I couldn't!

5545
03:25:54,260 --> 03:25:55,860
I couldn't disappear!

5546
03:25:57,180 --> 03:25:57,700
No!

5547
03:25:57,880 --> 03:25:58,520
Okay wait.

5548
03:25:58,640 --> 03:25:59,120
I'm gonna...

5549
03:26:00,160 --> 03:26:02,480
I'm gonna do one last command line and we can do one last game.

5550
03:26:03,880 --> 03:26:04,620
You know what?

5551
03:26:04,660 --> 03:26:05,400
Maybe I should too.

5552
03:26:05,900 --> 03:26:06,960
Alright let's both...

5553
03:26:06,960 --> 03:26:08,100
Let's do some commands.

5554
03:26:08,440 --> 03:26:08,580
No!

5555
03:26:08,740 --> 03:26:09,860
They saw me before...

5556
03:26:09,860 --> 03:26:11,400
Like this game is ass.

5557
03:26:11,620 --> 03:26:13,880
They saw me before I disappeared!

5558
03:26:15,040 --> 03:26:16,340
Before I could...

5559
03:26:16,340 --> 03:26:18,440
Before I could shred...

5560
03:26:18,440 --> 03:26:20,460
my VMAs for it.

5561
03:26:20,460 --> 03:26:21,680
Alright guys.

5562
03:26:22,120 --> 03:26:23,600
What is the new command line?

5563
03:26:24,000 --> 03:26:25,780
I gave you a chance to use my P20!

5564
03:26:26,060 --> 03:26:26,800
That's the worst part.

5565
03:26:27,380 --> 03:26:29,360
I didn't get my gold P20 because...

5566
03:26:30,400 --> 03:26:31,300
No you don't.

5567
03:26:31,320 --> 03:26:32,360
It's literally...

5568
03:26:32,360 --> 03:26:35,380
No I'm trying to switch back to DX11.

5569
03:26:35,620 --> 03:26:36,060
Alright guys.

5570
03:26:36,280 --> 03:26:37,980
This is my current command line.

5571
03:26:38,420 --> 03:26:39,560
What do I have to fix?

5572
03:26:39,800 --> 03:26:40,240
Guys.

5573
03:26:40,700 --> 03:26:42,620
What do I have to fix?

5574
03:26:43,040 --> 03:26:43,560
Hold up guys.

5575
03:26:43,760 --> 03:26:44,060
Alright.

5576
03:26:45,940 --> 03:26:47,280
Refresh rate high.

5577
03:26:47,480 --> 03:26:47,860
Okay.

5578
03:26:48,000 --> 03:26:48,520
I'll refresh.

5579
03:26:48,700 --> 03:26:49,440
I'll add that in.

5580
03:26:49,600 --> 03:26:51,840
I'm gonna add in my fucking command line.

5581
03:26:52,320 --> 03:26:53,980
All the text that's in there.

5582
03:26:55,300 --> 03:26:55,920
You know what?

5583
03:26:55,980 --> 03:26:57,180
I'm gonna get rid of the DX11.

5584
03:26:57,180 --> 03:26:58,580
I'm gonna get rid of that.

5585
03:26:59,080 --> 03:27:00,880
And then I'm gonna use this.

5586
03:27:01,080 --> 03:27:02,580
I'm gonna use this command line.

5587
03:27:04,780 --> 03:27:06,000
I don't know if I should.

5588
03:27:07,480 --> 03:27:08,440
Force Reload.

5589
03:27:08,440 --> 03:27:10,280
This fucking Valve game.

5590
03:27:10,760 --> 03:27:11,240
Alright.

5591
03:27:11,720 --> 03:27:12,660
Here it is.

5592
03:27:13,680 --> 03:27:15,220
This is gonna be my command line.

5593
03:27:15,400 --> 03:27:16,200
My newest one.

5594
03:27:16,280 --> 03:27:16,980
My newest...

5595
03:27:16,980 --> 03:27:18,360
Command is getting bigger.

5596
03:27:18,820 --> 03:27:20,820
The newest... I don't even know.

5597
03:27:20,880 --> 03:27:21,920
I should just fucking...

5598
03:27:21,920 --> 03:27:25,060
And I'm also gonna shop for 2 sticks of 32 gigabytes.

5599
03:27:34,310 --> 03:27:34,630
Alright.

5600
03:27:35,410 --> 03:27:36,930
My last...

5601
03:27:36,930 --> 03:27:39,230
My last command line.

5602
03:27:39,430 --> 03:27:41,090
Of the day.

5603
03:27:42,050 --> 03:27:44,150
And then we're just gonna...

5604
03:27:44,150 --> 03:27:45,110
Add more RAM later.

5605
03:27:46,150 --> 03:27:47,610
Add more RAM.

5606
03:27:48,450 --> 03:27:49,730
We're expanding.

5607
03:27:50,130 --> 03:27:52,510
The desk we haven't expanded before.

5608
03:27:53,810 --> 03:27:54,650
Yay RAM.

5609
03:27:54,650 --> 03:27:56,070
I'm gonna eat some RAMs.

5610
03:27:58,890 --> 03:27:59,730
Alright.

5611
03:28:00,930 --> 03:28:01,930
Let's try.

5612
03:28:05,970 --> 03:28:06,810
Alright.

5613
03:28:06,830 --> 03:28:07,210
Continue.

5614
03:28:07,710 --> 03:28:08,230
Alright.

5615
03:28:08,330 --> 03:28:09,630
I'm ready whenever you are.

5616
03:28:09,810 --> 03:28:10,850
Does this work?

5617
03:28:11,090 --> 03:28:12,130
Am I switching back to the X11?

5618
03:28:12,130 --> 03:28:12,710
I don't fucking know.

5619
03:28:13,650 --> 03:28:14,470
I don't know.

5620
03:28:14,590 --> 03:28:14,750
I...

5621
03:28:17,730 --> 03:28:18,970
I don't know.

5622
03:28:19,070 --> 03:28:19,930
I'm waiting on you now.

5623
03:28:20,710 --> 03:28:21,710
Let's see then.

5624
03:28:21,930 --> 03:28:22,270
Play.

5625
03:28:23,110 --> 03:28:24,690
This game is stupid.

5626
03:28:27,290 --> 03:28:29,210
How... Where to download...

5627
03:28:29,210 --> 03:28:30,210
More...

5628
03:28:30,790 --> 03:28:31,070
RAM.

5629
03:28:32,750 --> 03:28:33,310
Yes.

5630
03:28:33,650 --> 03:28:34,150
My TJ!

5631
03:28:34,370 --> 03:28:36,150
I only have one game left!

5632
03:28:37,270 --> 03:28:37,870
Okay!

5633
03:28:38,610 --> 03:28:40,270
What are you adding in?

5634
03:28:41,030 --> 03:28:42,110
I... I am...

5635
03:28:42,110 --> 03:28:43,710
I am waiting for game.

5636
03:28:44,110 --> 03:28:46,170
Oh you're waiting... Oh the shaders?

5637
03:28:46,750 --> 03:28:47,350
Yes.

5638
03:28:48,590 --> 03:28:50,130
It just says wait for game.

5639
03:28:50,610 --> 03:28:51,150
Alright.

5640
03:28:51,730 --> 03:28:52,570
I'm here.

5641
03:28:53,510 --> 03:28:54,730
I'm here to wait.

5642
03:28:55,070 --> 03:28:55,770
It's waiting for game.

5643
03:29:02,780 --> 03:29:03,380
Alright.

5644
03:29:08,290 --> 03:29:09,590
Are you still waiting?

5645
03:29:12,960 --> 03:29:14,160
Are you still waiting?

5646
03:29:14,540 --> 03:29:15,420
I'm in.

5647
03:29:17,340 --> 03:29:20,260
I have received a hundred Apex coins.

5648
03:29:20,760 --> 03:29:21,380
I have received a hundred Apex coins.

5649
03:29:21,380 --> 03:29:21,980
Should we try Asia?

5650
03:29:22,160 --> 03:29:22,680
No.

5651
03:29:22,780 --> 03:29:23,300
Okay.

5652
03:29:23,380 --> 03:29:23,680
I mean sure.

5653
03:29:23,780 --> 03:29:24,060
What?

5654
03:29:25,380 --> 03:29:26,500
My maze.

5655
03:29:29,800 --> 03:29:31,840
I'm fucking trying to find you.

5656
03:29:31,960 --> 03:29:32,340
I'm fucking trying to find you.

5657
03:29:32,340 --> 03:29:33,180
You're not on.

5658
03:29:33,760 --> 03:29:34,680
I am.

5659
03:29:35,180 --> 03:29:35,740
No you're not.

5660
03:29:36,140 --> 03:29:37,280
I literally don't see you.

5661
03:29:37,680 --> 03:29:38,560
I am.

5662
03:29:38,860 --> 03:29:40,120
Look thoroughly.

5663
03:29:41,180 --> 03:29:41,780
Engine.

5664
03:29:43,200 --> 03:29:43,800
No.

5665
03:29:45,540 --> 03:29:46,440
I'm on.

5666
03:29:46,980 --> 03:29:47,660
No you're not.

5667
03:29:48,100 --> 03:29:48,660
Yes!

5668
03:29:48,800 --> 03:29:50,200
I'm right there bro.

5669
03:29:50,200 --> 03:29:51,140
Okay now you are.

5670
03:29:51,940 --> 03:29:53,640
I'm right there dude.

5671
03:29:53,740 --> 03:29:54,020
Alright.

5672
03:29:54,540 --> 03:29:56,940
Back to...

5673
03:29:56,940 --> 03:29:57,960
Okay.

5674
03:29:58,020 --> 03:29:59,540
I don't want to play crypto anymore.

5675
03:29:59,660 --> 03:30:00,220
I want to play...

5676
03:30:00,220 --> 03:30:01,900
Oh yeah I wanted to play Vantage.

5677
03:30:02,620 --> 03:30:04,240
I wanted to try Vantage.

5678
03:30:04,880 --> 03:30:06,980
See look at these insta-queues.

5679
03:30:08,780 --> 03:30:10,480
Look at these insta-queues.

5680
03:30:11,040 --> 03:30:12,100
Singapore could never.

5681
03:30:12,600 --> 03:30:12,940
Yeah!

5682
03:30:15,600 --> 03:30:16,160
Alright.

5683
03:30:16,300 --> 03:30:16,740
Oh yeah.

5684
03:30:16,780 --> 03:30:16,960
Now they're playing.

5685
03:30:16,980 --> 03:30:17,320
Now they're playing.

5686
03:30:17,460 --> 03:30:18,220
Don't play.

5687
03:30:19,440 --> 03:30:19,960
Yeah.

5688
03:30:22,180 --> 03:30:25,880
See where the double akimbo third weapon slot would be.

5689
03:30:26,300 --> 03:30:26,820
Alright.

5690
03:30:30,720 --> 03:30:32,900
Alright after this stream.

5691
03:30:33,100 --> 03:30:38,640
I'm going to look up to see if my local PC stores have like 32 gigabytes of RAM.

5692
03:30:40,160 --> 03:30:41,580
Are you on DDR5?

5693
03:30:42,120 --> 03:30:43,300
I don't fucking know.

5694
03:30:43,320 --> 03:30:44,400
I need to look at my specs again.

5695
03:30:44,660 --> 03:30:44,960
I need to...

5696
03:30:46,800 --> 03:30:48,360
She doesn't even know her specs.

5697
03:30:48,720 --> 03:30:50,640
I don't know it on the top of my head.

5698
03:30:51,360 --> 03:30:52,580
I don't know it on the top of my head.

5699
03:30:52,580 --> 03:30:52,820
Wow.

5700
03:30:53,240 --> 03:30:55,280
Look I'm going through a lot right now.

5701
03:30:55,620 --> 03:30:57,280
Oh you're going through a lot.

5702
03:30:57,320 --> 03:30:58,060
Sure buddy.

5703
03:30:58,920 --> 03:30:59,400
Sure.

5704
03:31:00,820 --> 03:31:01,300
Surely.

5705
03:31:03,340 --> 03:31:04,160
Surely you are.

5706
03:31:12,500 --> 03:31:15,320
Where is SuperGuna going to go?

5707
03:31:18,120 --> 03:31:19,720
Come on Gooner.

5708
03:31:21,620 --> 03:31:22,800
Alright here we go.

5709
03:31:24,680 --> 03:31:25,180
Here we go.

5710
03:31:25,180 --> 03:31:26,520
Honestly I still haven't seen the whole map.

5711
03:31:27,120 --> 03:31:28,040
I feel...

5712
03:31:28,040 --> 03:31:28,500
I don't know.

5713
03:31:28,600 --> 03:31:30,840
All the places blur together for me.

5714
03:31:30,900 --> 03:31:32,020
Because they're all very similar.

5715
03:31:32,220 --> 03:31:32,500
You know?

5716
03:31:33,280 --> 03:31:33,760
Yes.

5717
03:31:34,160 --> 03:31:35,580
They all look very similar so I...

5718
03:31:35,580 --> 03:31:37,480
I can't tell what's new.

5719
03:31:38,940 --> 03:31:41,460
Bro what the fuck is wrong with you?

5720
03:31:42,240 --> 03:31:43,480
That's not fair.

5721
03:31:44,500 --> 03:31:45,880
This guy took my loot.

5722
03:31:52,560 --> 03:31:54,080
There's like a guy on my house.

5723
03:31:54,880 --> 03:31:55,360
There's like a guy on my house.

5724
03:31:57,570 --> 03:31:58,350
Oh my god.

5725
03:31:58,950 --> 03:31:59,950
This is not fair.

5726
03:32:00,050 --> 03:32:01,430
He gets like a fucking L-Star.

5727
03:32:01,830 --> 03:32:01,990
This is not fair.

5728
03:32:01,990 --> 03:32:01,990
He gets like a fucking L-Star.

5729
03:32:03,310 --> 03:32:04,150
Where are you?

5730
03:32:04,410 --> 03:32:06,430
On my building.

5731
03:32:06,870 --> 03:32:07,130
Nice.

5732
03:32:07,610 --> 03:32:08,630
Yeah he was one.

5733
03:32:08,870 --> 03:32:09,010
Nice.

5734
03:32:09,010 --> 03:32:09,010
Yeah he was one.

5735
03:32:10,830 --> 03:32:11,270
Oh shit!

5736
03:32:11,890 --> 03:32:13,630
This is fucked up.

5737
03:32:16,150 --> 03:32:17,390
This is fucked up.

5738
03:32:17,550 --> 03:32:18,810
I should send out a bat.

5739
03:32:19,130 --> 03:32:19,490
Pew!

5740
03:32:21,370 --> 03:32:22,270
Over there.

5741
03:32:23,110 --> 03:32:23,750
Nice.

5742
03:32:29,470 --> 03:32:31,550
What did you get bitch?

5743
03:32:34,530 --> 03:32:36,270
I need like heals.

5744
03:32:39,010 --> 03:32:40,470
Oh they're respawning.

5745
03:32:44,170 --> 03:32:44,690
Where?

5746
03:32:47,310 --> 03:32:48,190
Enemy down.

5747
03:32:48,330 --> 03:32:48,650
Nice.

5748
03:32:51,750 --> 03:32:52,270
Deserves.

5749
03:32:52,430 --> 03:32:53,490
How dare they.

5750
03:32:54,550 --> 03:32:56,030
I'm gonna loot your shit too.

5751
03:32:56,590 --> 03:32:58,470
I know you earned that kill.

5752
03:32:58,530 --> 03:32:59,190
But I'm gonna loot it.

5753
03:33:00,710 --> 03:33:01,690
Oh I hear them.

5754
03:33:02,630 --> 03:33:03,150
Oh.

5755
03:33:03,710 --> 03:33:05,830
It automatically doubles the Mozambique.

5756
03:33:06,490 --> 03:33:07,870
I need a Mozambique too.

5757
03:33:08,470 --> 03:33:08,990
Wait.

5758
03:33:09,130 --> 03:33:10,350
I have a hammerpoint.

5759
03:33:10,390 --> 03:33:10,770
Do you want it?

5760
03:33:12,490 --> 03:33:14,010
Wait I should have double Mozambique.

5761
03:33:14,130 --> 03:33:14,370
Nevermind.

5762
03:33:14,430 --> 03:33:14,630
JK.

5763
03:33:14,810 --> 03:33:18,510
On me.

5764
03:33:19,610 --> 03:33:20,210
Woah!

5765
03:33:23,230 --> 03:33:24,990
I got fucking...

5766
03:33:27,950 --> 03:33:30,110
I got fucking...

5767
03:33:30,110 --> 03:33:30,570
I got fucking...

5768
03:33:30,570 --> 03:33:31,870
Dude he got fucked up.

5769
03:33:33,550 --> 03:33:34,150
No!

5770
03:33:34,150 --> 03:33:35,050
He was one!

5771
03:33:35,270 --> 03:33:35,730
No!

5772
03:33:37,420 --> 03:33:37,980
One!

5773
03:33:38,240 --> 03:33:38,840
Live!

5774
03:33:39,200 --> 03:33:39,500
No!

5775
03:33:42,050 --> 03:33:43,410
He left.

5776
03:33:43,670 --> 03:33:44,770
Our guy left.

5777
03:33:45,050 --> 03:33:45,450
No!

5778
03:33:45,510 --> 03:33:46,250
Our guy left.

5779
03:33:46,290 --> 03:33:46,450
He left.

5780
03:33:46,470 --> 03:33:47,350
You're supposed to spawn.

5781
03:33:47,610 --> 03:33:48,310
Oh wait.

5782
03:33:48,350 --> 03:33:49,650
No he did spawn.

5783
03:33:49,890 --> 03:33:50,790
He did spawn.

5784
03:33:52,150 --> 03:33:53,550
Yeah he did spawn.

5785
03:33:54,450 --> 03:33:56,090
That's fucking crazy.

5786
03:33:56,650 --> 03:33:58,290
He left but he...

5787
03:33:58,290 --> 03:34:00,550
He left but he clutched it.

5788
03:34:01,030 --> 03:34:02,250
Oh my god.

5789
03:34:02,610 --> 03:34:05,170
He actually left but it counted.

5790
03:34:05,610 --> 03:34:07,230
It fucking counted.

5791
03:34:07,590 --> 03:34:08,450
Thank god.

5792
03:34:10,070 --> 03:34:11,650
Thank fucking god.

5793
03:34:13,270 --> 03:34:13,990
Wow.

5794
03:34:15,270 --> 03:34:15,990
Alright.

5795
03:34:16,470 --> 03:34:16,830
I'm alive.

5796
03:34:17,070 --> 03:34:17,990
That's all that matters.

5797
03:34:20,150 --> 03:34:20,850
Let's see.

5798
03:34:21,450 --> 03:34:22,450
Where are you?

5799
03:34:24,070 --> 03:34:25,230
I'm dropping down.

5800
03:34:28,610 --> 03:34:29,830
Apparently like you don't...

5801
03:34:29,830 --> 03:34:30,170
Wait.

5802
03:34:30,270 --> 03:34:31,610
I thought you don't have to look.

5803
03:34:32,010 --> 03:34:32,650
Wait what?

5804
03:34:34,630 --> 03:34:37,690
I thought they updated so that you don't have to look at the echo.

5805
03:34:38,170 --> 03:34:38,650
I thought they updated so that you don't have to look at the echo.

5806
03:34:38,650 --> 03:34:39,470
I might as well read it.

5807
03:34:39,530 --> 03:34:39,770
I might as well read it.

5808
03:34:40,250 --> 03:34:42,790
Did I read the patch run?

5809
03:34:43,150 --> 03:34:44,270
What was it?

5810
03:34:44,650 --> 03:34:45,970
Did you read it correctly?

5811
03:34:45,970 --> 03:34:47,590
I think I... I mean I can't read.

5812
03:34:47,730 --> 03:34:48,610
So I'm pretty...

5813
03:34:49,230 --> 03:34:49,750
Right.

5814
03:34:49,850 --> 03:34:50,310
Sure.

5815
03:34:53,210 --> 03:34:55,790
I can't read so most likely yeah.

5816
03:34:56,170 --> 03:34:56,650
Oh.

5817
03:34:56,970 --> 03:34:57,950
Most likely.

5818
03:34:58,990 --> 03:35:00,630
Fancy pants reading.

5819
03:35:02,870 --> 03:35:03,830
Where are they?

5820
03:35:03,930 --> 03:35:04,750
I scanned them.

5821
03:35:04,850 --> 03:35:05,750
They should be over there.

5822
03:35:06,050 --> 03:35:06,830
They're like right there.

5823
03:35:07,110 --> 03:35:08,090
Like in that building.

5824
03:35:08,190 --> 03:35:08,650
Do you see that?

5825
03:35:08,690 --> 03:35:09,490
Did they upgrade it?

5826
03:35:10,050 --> 03:35:10,570
No.

5827
03:35:11,130 --> 03:35:12,890
Refresh, tackle, improve it.

5828
03:35:13,950 --> 03:35:16,050
Gain access to ring content.

5829
03:35:19,310 --> 03:35:21,590
I don't see them.

5830
03:35:22,110 --> 03:35:22,910
Oh they're fighting.

5831
03:35:23,630 --> 03:35:24,870
I guess we go.

5832
03:35:30,030 --> 03:35:31,450
I'm gonna go up.

5833
03:35:31,990 --> 03:35:33,110
Can we go up?

5834
03:35:35,450 --> 03:35:36,130
Nice.

5835
03:35:41,330 --> 03:35:42,690
Oh below.

5836
03:35:46,000 --> 03:35:47,160
Are they like...

5837
03:35:47,820 --> 03:35:48,320
Whoa!

5838
03:35:48,480 --> 03:35:48,960
Okay.

5839
03:35:49,780 --> 03:35:51,240
They're like right below us.

5840
03:35:53,600 --> 03:35:54,720
Wait can you ping them?

5841
03:35:56,060 --> 03:35:57,140
Oh I'm... I'm... I'm...

5842
03:35:58,140 --> 03:35:59,020
I'm snared.

5843
03:36:02,380 --> 03:36:03,200
I got one.

5844
03:36:08,640 --> 03:36:09,600
Got the other.

5845
03:36:09,800 --> 03:36:10,280
You bitch.

5846
03:36:11,660 --> 03:36:12,280
It's okay.

5847
03:36:12,400 --> 03:36:13,900
Our super goona is still alive.

5848
03:36:14,440 --> 03:36:16,260
Our super goona is still alive.

5849
03:36:16,320 --> 03:36:17,520
So you should be fine.

5850
03:36:19,640 --> 03:36:20,520
Kill me man.

5851
03:36:20,620 --> 03:36:21,060
Kill me.

5852
03:36:22,680 --> 03:36:23,180
Okay.

5853
03:36:23,760 --> 03:36:24,600
Stay alive.

5854
03:36:24,700 --> 03:36:25,740
There's like a whole squad there.

5855
03:36:26,780 --> 03:36:28,020
Super goona please.

5856
03:36:28,460 --> 03:36:29,600
Super goona please.

5857
03:36:30,660 --> 03:36:31,760
Super goona please.

5858
03:36:32,220 --> 03:36:32,360
Pew!

5859
03:36:32,800 --> 03:36:33,280
Pew!

5860
03:36:34,140 --> 03:36:34,660
Pew!

5861
03:36:34,660 --> 03:36:35,180
No!

5862
03:36:35,800 --> 03:36:36,320
Oh!

5863
03:36:36,460 --> 03:36:36,980
Oh!

5864
03:36:37,460 --> 03:36:38,440
They can die too!

5865
03:36:39,040 --> 03:36:39,560
Yeah!

5866
03:36:41,980 --> 03:36:43,420
That's right you can't thirst me!

5867
03:36:45,580 --> 03:36:49,700
I was gonna say it would be funny if super goona like DCs you know while we're waiting.

5868
03:36:50,720 --> 03:36:51,960
I'm just kidding.

5869
03:36:51,960 --> 03:36:54,600
Oh no.

5870
03:36:54,720 --> 03:36:55,920
Live for 30 seconds.

5871
03:36:56,160 --> 03:36:57,720
We can't rely on super goona.

5872
03:36:58,000 --> 03:37:01,020
It's like the timer's almost gone for DC.

5873
03:37:01,820 --> 03:37:01,880
It's like the timer's almost gone for DC.

5874
03:37:01,880 --> 03:37:02,240
Like...

5875
03:37:03,460 --> 03:37:05,220
He won't be able to come back soon.

5876
03:37:05,600 --> 03:37:07,180
We can't use this.

5877
03:37:08,360 --> 03:37:09,360
Super goona.

5878
03:37:09,760 --> 03:37:10,840
Where did you...

5879
03:37:10,840 --> 03:37:12,980
His outlet is used for...

5880
03:37:12,980 --> 03:37:14,460
Where are they anyway?

5881
03:37:17,840 --> 03:37:18,680
Like I don't know.

5882
03:37:18,760 --> 03:37:19,420
I heard a footstep.

5883
03:37:19,460 --> 03:37:19,980
Where are they?

5884
03:37:23,040 --> 03:37:23,480
Alright.

5885
03:37:24,580 --> 03:37:25,540
I'm heading over.

5886
03:37:26,200 --> 03:37:27,100
I see them.

5887
03:37:27,320 --> 03:37:27,980
Ping ping them?

5888
03:37:28,720 --> 03:37:29,720
Oh that's where they are.

5889
03:37:29,720 --> 03:37:30,760
Yeah like around them.

5890
03:37:30,980 --> 03:37:31,420
Alright.

5891
03:37:31,760 --> 03:37:35,360
I am dropping over here on this high ground.

5892
03:37:35,660 --> 03:37:36,860
If I die I die.

5893
03:37:40,550 --> 03:37:41,510
I don't see them.

5894
03:37:42,890 --> 03:37:43,670
Oh I see them.

5895
03:37:44,850 --> 03:37:45,470
They're here.

5896
03:37:45,750 --> 03:37:46,190
They're here.

5897
03:37:46,210 --> 03:37:47,850
On that high ground but he dropped down.

5898
03:37:51,700 --> 03:37:52,700
Oh I see him.

5899
03:37:53,480 --> 03:37:55,460
I have to knock one of them.

5900
03:37:55,820 --> 03:37:56,220
50?

5901
03:37:58,540 --> 03:37:59,280
He's scared.

5902
03:38:01,960 --> 03:38:02,980
Wait wait wait.

5903
03:38:04,440 --> 03:38:05,640
I'm gonna get two more bullets.

5904
03:38:06,000 --> 03:38:06,560
Wait wait.

5905
03:38:06,620 --> 03:38:07,260
I don't know if that's smart.

5906
03:38:07,380 --> 03:38:08,020
I don't know if that's smart.

5907
03:38:08,820 --> 03:38:10,180
I don't know if that's smart.

5908
03:38:13,120 --> 03:38:14,520
I don't know if that's smart.

5909
03:38:15,840 --> 03:38:16,780
It will be.

5910
03:38:17,640 --> 03:38:18,040
I don't know if that's smart.

5911
03:38:18,060 --> 03:38:18,340
Okay.

5912
03:38:18,940 --> 03:38:20,080
I'm heading over.

5913
03:38:23,220 --> 03:38:24,340
I'm heading over.

5914
03:38:24,860 --> 03:38:25,020
I'm heading over.

5915
03:38:25,280 --> 03:38:25,880
I'm heading over.

5916
03:38:27,160 --> 03:38:28,080
I'm here with you.

5917
03:38:31,240 --> 03:38:31,840
Splash!

5918
03:38:32,000 --> 03:38:33,040
I'm missing all my shots.

5919
03:38:33,380 --> 03:38:33,840
No!

5920
03:38:34,960 --> 03:38:36,640
He's literally one shot shot.

5921
03:38:36,860 --> 03:38:37,860
He's running inside.

5922
03:38:38,880 --> 03:38:39,660
Got him?

5923
03:38:39,780 --> 03:38:40,020
Nice.

5924
03:38:40,460 --> 03:38:41,580
It's not a wipe though.

5925
03:38:43,320 --> 03:38:45,340
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.

5926
03:38:45,700 --> 03:38:46,520
Doesn't matter.

5927
03:38:50,020 --> 03:38:51,180
Maybe I should too.

5928
03:38:52,240 --> 03:38:54,200
Maybe I should too.

5929
03:38:55,540 --> 03:38:56,640
That's fucking right.

5930
03:38:56,800 --> 03:38:57,660
We want your loot.

5931
03:38:58,380 --> 03:38:59,060
That's right.

5932
03:39:01,460 --> 03:39:01,960
Oh!

5933
03:39:03,200 --> 03:39:03,860
Teammate's here.

5934
03:39:04,060 --> 03:39:06,040
This is gonna be funny.

5935
03:39:06,200 --> 03:39:07,220
This is a funny strat.

5936
03:39:07,920 --> 03:39:09,200
Wait his teammate...

5937
03:39:09,200 --> 03:39:09,940
Oh I see you.

5938
03:39:12,020 --> 03:39:13,140
I see you.

5939
03:39:13,140 --> 03:39:14,660
You're gonna wait until your teammates spawn back?

5940
03:39:17,040 --> 03:39:18,040
I see you.

5941
03:39:18,040 --> 03:39:18,040
You're gonna wait until your teammates spawn back?

5942
03:39:18,040 --> 03:39:18,260
Hello.

5943
03:39:18,600 --> 03:39:19,080
Pussy.

5944
03:39:20,640 --> 03:39:21,360
Where you at?

5945
03:39:21,900 --> 03:39:22,380
He's up there.

5946
03:39:23,000 --> 03:39:25,900
He's waiting for his teammates to spawn back in before he does anything.

5947
03:39:26,800 --> 03:39:28,780
This is gonna be the funniest strat ever.

5948
03:39:28,980 --> 03:39:29,120
Guys we missed...

5949
03:39:29,780 --> 03:39:31,820
We don't have SuperGuna anymore.

5950
03:39:32,060 --> 03:39:33,020
SuperGuna is not...

5951
03:39:33,020 --> 03:39:34,520
No we don't have him.

5952
03:39:34,640 --> 03:39:35,460
He's not our...

5953
03:39:36,040 --> 03:39:39,180
Our emergency contact is gone.

5954
03:39:39,720 --> 03:39:40,420
Our emergency contact is gone.

5955
03:39:40,940 --> 03:39:41,960
Wait what the fuck?

5956
03:39:42,640 --> 03:39:42,680
Wait what the fuck?

5957
03:39:44,480 --> 03:39:45,120
On me.

5958
03:39:46,820 --> 03:39:47,540
On you?

5959
03:39:47,700 --> 03:39:49,060
He went to get his... yeah yeah right here.

5960
03:39:49,320 --> 03:39:50,700
I don't know why he was here.

5961
03:39:50,940 --> 03:39:53,040
Fresh tactical on hits with ultimate.

5962
03:39:53,840 --> 03:39:56,080
Ultimate... improved tactical dumple jump.

5963
03:39:56,200 --> 03:39:57,660
I actually don't know which is good.

5964
03:39:58,840 --> 03:39:59,620
Me neither.

5965
03:40:00,340 --> 03:40:01,240
Where did he go?

5966
03:40:01,460 --> 03:40:02,280
I don't think anyone uses Vantage.

5967
03:40:02,280 --> 03:40:02,600
There there.

5968
03:40:03,980 --> 03:40:06,380
Yeah they said they buffed him but like...

5969
03:40:07,140 --> 03:40:07,620
Where?

5970
03:40:11,420 --> 03:40:12,660
In what aspect?

5971
03:40:12,660 --> 03:40:14,660
Like her sniping?

5972
03:40:15,360 --> 03:40:16,760
Like damage is higher now.

5973
03:40:16,900 --> 03:40:17,880
This guy over there.

5974
03:40:19,560 --> 03:40:20,720
How do we push this?

5975
03:40:21,220 --> 03:40:22,540
I don't know I'm trying to...

5976
03:40:23,920 --> 03:40:24,420
50...

5977
03:40:25,920 --> 03:40:26,420
125...

5978
03:40:26,420 --> 03:40:27,140
They're literally one.

5979
03:40:28,280 --> 03:40:29,920
This guy is literally one HP.

5980
03:40:31,020 --> 03:40:32,040
One of them is.

5981
03:40:34,300 --> 03:40:35,660
Oh I did a leg jump.

5982
03:40:38,140 --> 03:40:38,640
Oh!

5983
03:40:39,820 --> 03:40:41,060
There's people fighting.

5984
03:40:48,850 --> 03:40:49,990
Oh they're hard fighting.

5985
03:40:50,970 --> 03:40:51,850
Oh we're doing this.

5986
03:40:53,050 --> 03:40:54,390
Uh... if you want to.

5987
03:40:54,990 --> 03:40:56,250
They're right here I see them.

5988
03:40:56,310 --> 03:40:57,330
Full kill Felka.

5989
03:40:57,710 --> 03:40:58,370
Full kill.

5990
03:40:58,590 --> 03:40:59,970
I saw it.

5991
03:41:02,390 --> 03:41:03,610
I saw the full kill.

5992
03:41:04,630 --> 03:41:06,270
There's another team over here in front of me.

5993
03:41:07,390 --> 03:41:07,830
What!

5994
03:41:07,970 --> 03:41:08,730
I missed!

5995
03:41:08,810 --> 03:41:09,270
Oh shi...

5996
03:41:09,810 --> 03:41:11,950
Okay fuck that guy in particular though.

5997
03:41:13,370 --> 03:41:14,010
Right here.

5998
03:41:15,010 --> 03:41:15,450
Knocked him.

5999
03:41:18,590 --> 03:41:19,370
Full dead?

6000
03:41:21,790 --> 03:41:22,750
He's right here.

6001
03:41:23,090 --> 03:41:23,610
Anymore?

6002
03:41:23,970 --> 03:41:25,310
Yeah inside inside inside.

6003
03:41:30,450 --> 03:41:30,970
Whoa!

6004
03:41:31,530 --> 03:41:32,430
Alright goodbye!

6005
03:41:33,230 --> 03:41:33,790
Bleed out!

6006
03:41:33,910 --> 03:41:34,630
Bleed out right now!

6007
03:41:34,670 --> 03:41:36,430
Bleed out right now!

6008
03:41:36,830 --> 03:41:40,410
If I bleed out it'll add like another 10 seconds.

6009
03:41:40,730 --> 03:41:42,090
Yeah but like...

6010
03:41:42,090 --> 03:41:44,750
There's no way I'm gonna fucking clutch that.

6011
03:41:44,950 --> 03:41:46,170
If it's a full team.

6012
03:41:46,670 --> 03:41:47,510
10 seconds.

6013
03:41:47,590 --> 03:41:48,550
It's okay I can fly.

6014
03:41:49,810 --> 03:41:50,590
Yeah yeah yeah I know you can.

6015
03:41:51,070 --> 03:41:51,510
Okay.

6016
03:41:53,130 --> 03:41:54,010
Not anymore.

6017
03:41:54,470 --> 03:41:55,610
I'm gonna hide in this.

6018
03:41:56,070 --> 03:41:56,810
I'm gonna hide here.

6019
03:41:56,910 --> 03:41:58,570
Hello welcome to my...

6020
03:42:02,090 --> 03:42:03,550
Okay see everything's fine.

6021
03:42:03,830 --> 03:42:05,990
I just realized I did not loot any shields.

6022
03:42:08,350 --> 03:42:09,510
Do I have shields?

6023
03:42:10,370 --> 03:42:11,130
That's my question.

6024
03:42:11,350 --> 03:42:13,390
I'm looking around for some shields right now.

6025
03:42:13,810 --> 03:42:14,650
I have cells.

6026
03:42:15,110 --> 03:42:15,970
Like a lot of cells.

6027
03:42:15,970 --> 03:42:16,450
I feel like...

6028
03:42:16,450 --> 03:42:20,310
I feel like the command lines I made definitely fixed a lot.

6029
03:42:21,510 --> 03:42:23,250
Chat has it improved a lot?

6030
03:42:23,450 --> 03:42:24,650
Has it improved a lot?

6031
03:42:26,670 --> 03:42:27,810
I repaired my game.

6032
03:42:27,970 --> 03:42:28,370
I repaired my game.

6033
03:42:28,370 --> 03:42:28,570
That's good.

6034
03:42:29,670 --> 03:42:31,950
It feels like it improved a lot.

6035
03:42:32,190 --> 03:42:33,870
I feel like I have less studies now.

6036
03:42:34,490 --> 03:42:35,610
We did it guys!

6037
03:42:35,910 --> 03:42:37,530
We tech supported our way out!

6038
03:42:37,590 --> 03:42:39,590
Even though I should have done this before the stream.

6039
03:42:39,870 --> 03:42:40,790
But we did it!

6040
03:42:41,190 --> 03:42:43,890
We never gave a fuck about the game.

6041
03:42:43,890 --> 03:42:45,650
I'm just...

6042
03:42:46,610 --> 03:42:47,890
Wait I hear...

6043
03:42:47,890 --> 03:42:49,890
Wait they're literally on me.

6044
03:42:51,030 --> 03:42:52,550
Holy shit!

6045
03:42:52,950 --> 03:42:53,370
Live!

6046
03:42:53,430 --> 03:42:53,590
Live!

6047
03:42:53,670 --> 03:42:53,890
Live!

6048
03:42:54,430 --> 03:42:57,530
How do I live?

6049
03:42:57,850 --> 03:42:58,310
Live!

6050
03:42:58,690 --> 03:42:59,550
I don't know!

6051
03:42:59,630 --> 03:43:00,530
I'm literally scared!

6052
03:43:00,690 --> 03:43:09,720
How do I live?

6053
03:43:09,720 --> 03:43:11,260
You were supposed to live!

6054
03:43:11,260 --> 03:43:12,360
I'm literally scared!

6055
03:43:15,640 --> 03:43:16,760
Literally scared bro!

6056
03:43:16,800 --> 03:43:18,220
How do I live?

6057
03:43:18,460 --> 03:43:19,620
Wait does that scan me?

6058
03:43:20,640 --> 03:43:21,140
Yes.

6059
03:43:22,660 --> 03:43:23,440
They're fighting!

6060
03:43:23,700 --> 03:43:23,780
They're fighting!

6061
03:43:24,260 --> 03:43:24,760
Live!

6062
03:43:25,180 --> 03:43:25,380
Live!

6063
03:43:25,420 --> 03:43:25,600
Live!

6064
03:43:25,840 --> 03:43:28,100
I'm in my safe spot right now so live!

6065
03:43:29,280 --> 03:43:30,740
Can you put the guard up?

6066
03:43:32,860 --> 03:43:34,260
I'm in my safe spot.

6067
03:43:36,740 --> 03:43:38,360
A footstep above you!

6068
03:43:39,020 --> 03:43:39,520
Fancy!

6069
03:43:41,720 --> 03:43:43,020
They're right next to me!

6070
03:43:43,100 --> 03:43:43,920
They're right next to me!

6071
03:43:46,080 --> 03:43:47,600
Live for four seconds!

6072
03:43:47,760 --> 03:43:48,800
Four more seconds!

6073
03:43:49,260 --> 03:43:49,980
There's a Loba!

6074
03:43:50,680 --> 03:43:51,700
There's a Loba!

6075
03:43:52,620 --> 03:43:53,520
Last zone!

6076
03:43:53,660 --> 03:43:54,040
Last zone!

6077
03:43:58,550 --> 03:43:59,770
Where do I drop though?

6078
03:43:59,910 --> 03:44:00,530
I don't fucking know!

6079
03:44:00,590 --> 03:44:01,090
Pick a place!

6080
03:44:02,070 --> 03:44:03,230
They'll chase me!

6081
03:44:03,430 --> 03:44:04,010
I don't know!

6082
03:44:04,070 --> 03:44:04,630
Pick a place!

6083
03:44:05,110 --> 03:44:06,310
Just away from me!

6084
03:44:08,330 --> 03:44:09,450
You think that's a good idea?

6085
03:44:09,870 --> 03:44:10,350
Yes!

6086
03:44:12,610 --> 03:44:15,530
100% I'll pick the ring then.

6087
03:44:16,510 --> 03:44:17,190
Right here?

6088
03:44:18,570 --> 03:44:19,450
I'll pick the ring.

6089
03:44:21,770 --> 03:44:22,210
Okay.

6090
03:44:22,290 --> 03:44:24,310
This map wants me to go down.

6091
03:44:24,390 --> 03:44:24,830
Straight.

6092
03:44:28,210 --> 03:44:29,930
There are people in front of me.

6093
03:44:30,910 --> 03:44:32,250
Oh my god I'm going to ring two!

6094
03:44:32,250 --> 03:44:32,910
I don't even know where I'm at.

6095
03:44:33,530 --> 03:44:35,110
I'm slowly heading towards you.

6096
03:44:36,870 --> 03:44:37,410
Just live!

6097
03:44:38,150 --> 03:44:38,830
Just live!

6098
03:44:38,950 --> 03:44:39,690
That's all I ask!

6099
03:44:43,820 --> 03:44:44,600
Oh what?

6100
03:44:44,800 --> 03:44:45,560
That didn't hit?

6101
03:44:46,300 --> 03:44:46,960
I'm sad.

6102
03:44:47,800 --> 03:44:48,700
Now they know I'm here.

6103
03:44:50,680 --> 03:44:51,280
I'm going to leave next to mine.

6104
03:44:51,680 --> 03:44:52,600
Oh my god.

6105
03:44:52,740 --> 03:44:54,540
Wait, enemies are respawning right next to me.

6106
03:44:55,660 --> 03:44:58,720
Yeah well, there's an enemy camping next to me.

6107
03:44:59,080 --> 03:45:00,000
Oh okay.

6108
03:45:00,180 --> 03:45:01,100
This is not good.

6109
03:45:01,820 --> 03:45:02,600
No it's not.

6110
03:45:04,460 --> 03:45:06,600
It's not good at all.

6111
03:45:07,940 --> 03:45:08,900
I am...

6112
03:45:08,900 --> 03:45:11,140
going to be in zone soon?

6113
03:45:12,380 --> 03:45:13,060
I'm in zone.

6114
03:45:13,480 --> 03:45:14,660
I'm just ratting.

6115
03:45:14,660 --> 03:45:15,700
I'm in zone right here.

6116
03:45:15,780 --> 03:45:16,160
Me too.

6117
03:45:17,520 --> 03:45:18,640
I'm ratting.

6118
03:45:19,040 --> 03:45:21,480
I have my double mozam.

6119
03:45:22,040 --> 03:45:23,020
I'm in zone.

6120
03:45:23,200 --> 03:45:23,600
It's stopped.

6121
03:45:24,760 --> 03:45:25,740
Just live!

6122
03:45:30,600 --> 03:45:31,720
I'm ratting.

6123
03:45:32,340 --> 03:45:32,900
Rats.

6124
03:45:33,040 --> 03:45:33,600
Rats.

6125
03:45:33,800 --> 03:45:35,240
We are the rats.

6126
03:45:36,340 --> 03:45:37,460
Technically in zone.

6127
03:45:40,240 --> 03:45:41,820
I believe in us.

6128
03:45:41,960 --> 03:45:43,840
Oh my god I hear... people are dying and ring?

6129
03:45:43,980 --> 03:45:44,220
How?

6130
03:45:46,440 --> 03:45:49,940
I've looked at the same guy three times dying in the ring.

6131
03:45:53,440 --> 03:45:55,360
Okay there should be no respawn now.

6132
03:45:55,540 --> 03:45:56,140
I'm pretty sure.

6133
03:45:56,720 --> 03:45:58,900
I think respawns turn off.

6134
03:45:59,020 --> 03:46:02,700
So like us being super separated is not very ideal now.

6135
03:46:03,380 --> 03:46:04,480
It is not.

6136
03:46:04,600 --> 03:46:04,800
It is not.

6137
03:46:05,020 --> 03:46:05,660
It is not.

6138
03:46:07,060 --> 03:46:08,900
Oh ho ho ho ho ho.

6139
03:46:09,120 --> 03:46:10,600
How do I get out of here?

6140
03:46:11,380 --> 03:46:12,780
Oh ho ho ho.

6141
03:46:13,000 --> 03:46:14,500
How do I get out of here?

6142
03:46:14,840 --> 03:46:15,560
Holy shit is it real?

6143
03:46:16,160 --> 03:46:17,480
Oh ho ho ho ho.

6144
03:46:17,500 --> 03:46:18,260
This is the ring.

6145
03:46:18,280 --> 03:46:20,020
I messed up.

6146
03:46:20,080 --> 03:46:21,320
I don't know how to get out of here.

6147
03:46:21,380 --> 03:46:22,420
I messed up too.

6148
03:46:24,840 --> 03:46:26,880
Now they will go to my house.

6149
03:46:27,080 --> 03:46:27,940
Oh ho ho ho.

6150
03:46:28,080 --> 03:46:28,600
Okay.

6151
03:46:28,760 --> 03:46:29,100
Live.

6152
03:46:29,800 --> 03:46:31,040
We just gotta live.

6153
03:46:31,140 --> 03:46:32,640
That's how we're gonna do it.

6154
03:46:32,900 --> 03:46:34,500
Ho ho ho ho.

6155
03:46:34,780 --> 03:46:35,740
Ho ho ho ho.

6156
03:46:37,500 --> 03:46:39,200
Ho ho ho ho.

6157
03:46:40,060 --> 03:46:41,760
Ho ho ho ho.

6158
03:46:42,600 --> 03:46:44,580
Okay there's no respawn left.

6159
03:46:44,700 --> 03:46:45,440
I'm pretty sure.

6160
03:46:45,880 --> 03:46:46,400
Right?

6161
03:46:46,520 --> 03:46:47,760
Is respawn off now?

6162
03:46:48,980 --> 03:46:51,300
Okay I'm gonna figure it out when you die.

6163
03:46:54,720 --> 03:46:55,840
I ran away.

6164
03:46:56,000 --> 03:46:57,140
How did I run away?

6165
03:46:57,460 --> 03:46:58,220
What the fuck?

6166
03:46:59,300 --> 03:47:00,580
Bro I ran away.

6167
03:47:00,820 --> 03:47:01,800
I literally ran away.

6168
03:47:01,800 --> 03:47:03,360
Okay I'm gonna go in like 20 seconds.

6169
03:47:05,300 --> 03:47:06,980
One of us will live.

6170
03:47:07,320 --> 03:47:08,840
I hope it's you.

6171
03:47:10,900 --> 03:47:11,420
Okay.

6172
03:47:11,420 --> 03:47:14,260
Bro I don't even have a third gun right now.

6173
03:47:16,640 --> 03:47:17,420
I lived.

6174
03:47:17,820 --> 03:47:18,520
For now.

6175
03:47:19,620 --> 03:47:21,400
Oh god this is bad.

6176
03:47:22,000 --> 03:47:23,560
What do you mean the enemy is respawning?

6177
03:47:24,160 --> 03:47:24,640
How?

6178
03:47:25,540 --> 03:47:27,480
Oh that means his respawn is not off yet.

6179
03:47:28,100 --> 03:47:29,140
Oh we could have died.

6180
03:47:34,200 --> 03:47:35,920
I don't know where people are.

6181
03:47:36,060 --> 03:47:37,540
That's like the scary part.

6182
03:47:39,400 --> 03:47:39,880
Freaky.

6183
03:47:41,340 --> 03:47:42,460
It's so freaky.

6184
03:47:42,920 --> 03:47:44,420
Holy shit what the fuck.

6185
03:47:44,420 --> 03:47:44,500
I'm gonna die.

6186
03:47:44,520 --> 03:47:44,640
What?

6187
03:47:44,780 --> 03:47:46,360
This shit is goaty.

6188
03:47:46,640 --> 03:47:47,100
Holy shit.

6189
03:47:48,960 --> 03:47:49,900
Holy shit.

6190
03:47:51,320 --> 03:47:53,260
What is even happening?

6191
03:47:54,240 --> 03:47:55,000
I'm goon.

6192
03:47:56,720 --> 03:47:57,740
You're what?

6193
03:47:58,200 --> 03:47:59,220
Nah bro.

6194
03:47:59,700 --> 03:48:00,940
Nah nah nah nah.

6195
03:48:01,340 --> 03:48:02,360
How do I get out of here?

6196
03:48:02,900 --> 03:48:08,500
How do I cross the road without getting shot by people?

6197
03:48:09,220 --> 03:48:10,560
I crossed the road.

6198
03:48:10,900 --> 03:48:11,260
No.

6199
03:48:11,720 --> 03:48:12,600
Me too.

6200
03:48:15,280 --> 03:48:16,700
Hoor hoor hoor.

6201
03:48:16,880 --> 03:48:17,920
We can meet up.

6202
03:48:17,920 --> 03:48:19,360
We're next to each other.

6203
03:48:20,260 --> 03:48:21,300
That's my purpose.

6204
03:48:26,830 --> 03:48:27,390
Aha.

6205
03:48:27,550 --> 03:48:29,210
So good to finally meet you.

6206
03:48:29,730 --> 03:48:30,650
It's been a while.

6207
03:48:31,010 --> 03:48:32,450
What you been doing man?

6208
03:48:32,650 --> 03:48:34,450
What you been doing?

6209
03:48:38,410 --> 03:48:40,270
How's the family man?

6210
03:48:40,490 --> 03:48:41,230
How's the family?

6211
03:48:43,030 --> 03:48:43,590
How's the family?

6212
03:48:43,590 --> 03:48:44,230
You know.

6213
03:48:44,770 --> 03:48:47,230
Bro I haven't seen you in like 20 years.

6214
03:48:47,330 --> 03:48:47,790
It's been a while.

6215
03:48:47,810 --> 03:48:48,270
Yeah.

6216
03:48:49,050 --> 03:48:50,750
The family is good.

6217
03:48:50,830 --> 03:48:52,810
You got that promotion you've been waiting for?

6218
03:48:52,930 --> 03:48:54,110
We've been trying to get it?

6219
03:48:54,550 --> 03:48:55,510
Oh no no.

6220
03:48:55,710 --> 03:48:55,890
I got fired.

6221
03:48:55,890 --> 03:48:56,170
Not yet.

6222
03:48:56,190 --> 03:48:57,890
You're still working at that dead end job?

6223
03:48:58,370 --> 03:48:59,670
I got fired.

6224
03:48:59,730 --> 03:49:01,310
You got fired man?

6225
03:49:01,470 --> 03:49:05,270
They told me to not be you know.

6226
03:49:05,570 --> 03:49:09,210
Wearing pants is apparently a must in the job.

6227
03:49:09,310 --> 03:49:10,570
And I don't like wearing pants.

6228
03:49:10,970 --> 03:49:11,170
Bro.

6229
03:49:12,130 --> 03:49:13,290
Was that in the contract?

6230
03:49:15,130 --> 03:49:16,650
I didn't think so.

6231
03:49:16,650 --> 03:49:18,450
Then you should sue them.

6232
03:49:18,610 --> 03:49:19,970
That's a lawsuit right there.

6233
03:49:20,010 --> 03:49:21,510
They can't discriminate against you.

6234
03:49:21,970 --> 03:49:22,110
Hahaha.

6235
03:49:25,990 --> 03:49:26,890
That's a bit fashionism.

6236
03:49:27,410 --> 03:49:27,990
Don't you think?

6237
03:49:29,710 --> 03:49:30,750
I don't know which way.

6238
03:49:30,850 --> 03:49:32,830
Should we go outside or like inside?

6239
03:49:33,690 --> 03:49:34,770
Do we split up again?

6240
03:49:34,830 --> 03:49:37,570
Inside because someone's in the fucking top floor.

6241
03:49:37,570 --> 03:49:37,810
No?

6242
03:49:38,750 --> 03:49:40,350
Yeah but we have to go outside eventually.

6243
03:49:40,630 --> 03:49:41,070
Right?

6244
03:49:41,350 --> 03:49:42,550
Yeah right.

6245
03:49:43,070 --> 03:49:44,950
But there's that funny looking thing.

6246
03:49:45,410 --> 03:49:46,630
And they're not all.

6247
03:49:46,650 --> 03:49:47,070
It's a high ground.

6248
03:49:47,270 --> 03:49:48,390
A high high ground?

6249
03:49:48,510 --> 03:49:49,230
Oh no.

6250
03:49:49,230 --> 03:49:50,110
Like above us.

6251
03:49:50,270 --> 03:49:51,150
Like that that.

6252
03:49:53,090 --> 03:49:54,830
This is not good for us.

6253
03:49:56,050 --> 03:49:57,390
Oh I think it will be.

6254
03:49:59,350 --> 03:50:00,030
Here here.

6255
03:50:00,090 --> 03:50:01,290
This way this way this way.

6256
03:50:01,690 --> 03:50:01,890
Maybe?

6257
03:50:02,250 --> 03:50:03,710
Yeah yeah there's a door right there.

6258
03:50:03,850 --> 03:50:04,650
That's what I'm saying.

6259
03:50:05,370 --> 03:50:07,530
Like if we could just take over that area.

6260
03:50:08,370 --> 03:50:10,310
It would be funny to see them.

6261
03:50:10,750 --> 03:50:11,230
Jikiki.

6262
03:50:12,010 --> 03:50:13,270
Orr orr orr.

6263
03:50:13,690 --> 03:50:14,850
Orr orr orr.

6264
03:50:16,650 --> 03:50:17,630
Orr orr orr orr.

6265
03:50:19,250 --> 03:50:19,730
Okay.

6266
03:50:20,370 --> 03:50:20,850
Okay.

6267
03:50:20,950 --> 03:50:22,170
Orr orr orr.

6268
03:50:23,390 --> 03:50:23,870
Jikiki.

6269
03:50:25,430 --> 03:50:25,670
Orr orr orr.

6270
03:50:25,990 --> 03:50:27,310
Orr orr orr.

6271
03:50:28,650 --> 03:50:30,630
Orr orr orr.

6272
03:50:33,050 --> 03:50:33,830
I'm scared.

6273
03:50:35,730 --> 03:50:37,370
Do you have enough nades for this?

6274
03:50:37,690 --> 03:50:38,970
Oh they have an arc star.

6275
03:50:39,750 --> 03:50:40,950
They have a lot of things.

6276
03:50:40,950 --> 03:50:41,210
They have a fucking thing.

6277
03:50:43,630 --> 03:50:44,230
Don't worry.

6278
03:50:44,950 --> 03:50:45,730
I have this.

6279
03:50:46,790 --> 03:50:47,550
You have what?

6280
03:50:47,650 --> 03:50:48,270
I have this.

6281
03:50:49,730 --> 03:50:50,810
How are we doing this?

6282
03:50:50,830 --> 03:50:51,290
I don't know.

6283
03:50:51,570 --> 03:50:53,530
I'm going to throw 20 nades.

6284
03:50:56,750 --> 03:50:57,890
Oh that's not good.

6285
03:50:59,130 --> 03:50:59,810
That's not good.

6286
03:51:00,070 --> 03:51:01,270
I need you to break that then.

6287
03:51:01,450 --> 03:51:02,010
You gotta break it.

6288
03:51:02,710 --> 03:51:04,010
You gotta break it earlier.

6289
03:51:06,750 --> 03:51:08,550
Bro you gotta break that earlier bro.

6290
03:51:08,870 --> 03:51:09,530
You gotta break it.

6291
03:51:12,210 --> 03:51:13,770
We could have kicked it together.

6292
03:51:14,130 --> 03:51:14,350
Yeah.

6293
03:51:16,650 --> 03:51:17,350
I got the nades.

6294
03:51:17,710 --> 03:51:18,350
AHH.

6295
03:51:19,630 --> 03:51:24,250
These highgrounds are f- Holy shit this is stupid.

6296
03:51:24,370 --> 03:51:25,450
I fucking hate this map.

6297
03:51:26,530 --> 03:51:27,430
That's stupid.

6298
03:51:28,370 --> 03:51:30,650
I hate the high high ground.

6299
03:51:31,050 --> 03:51:32,590
Bro I hate this.

6300
03:51:32,610 --> 03:51:33,330
I hate this.

6301
03:51:35,830 --> 03:51:36,570
That's embarrassing.

6302
03:51:37,250 --> 03:51:38,110
Bro I'm murdering people.

6303
03:51:40,490 --> 03:51:42,790
Bro fuck the high high ground.

6304
03:51:43,070 --> 03:51:43,530
Like.

6305
03:51:46,670 --> 03:51:47,890
I'm sorry people.

6306
03:51:48,150 --> 03:51:50,530
Get off the high ground.

6307
03:51:51,250 --> 03:51:55,190
I will commit the vehicular manslaughter.

6308
03:51:55,510 --> 03:51:56,030
Oh my god.

6309
03:51:56,250 --> 03:51:58,930
You don't have the license for it man.

6310
03:52:01,190 --> 03:52:02,770
Oh my god.

6311
03:52:03,450 --> 03:52:04,170
Okay.

6312
03:52:05,690 --> 03:52:10,310
We sort of low-key fixed our... we sort of low-key fixed it.

6313
03:52:12,790 --> 03:52:14,510
Honestly, it's good that I fixed it.

6314
03:52:14,530 --> 03:52:16,610
Does yours feel better too?

6315
03:52:17,150 --> 03:52:18,070
Kind of, yes.

6316
03:52:19,170 --> 03:52:21,430
Because I have a tournament ticket.

6317
03:52:24,530 --> 03:52:25,670
Oh my god.

6318
03:52:28,350 --> 03:52:28,910
It's okay.

6319
03:52:29,010 --> 03:52:31,990
We sort of low-key fixed it a little bit.

6320
03:52:32,050 --> 03:52:33,690
But I'll still get the RAM because I feel like...

6321
03:52:33,690 --> 03:52:38,630
I don't feel comfortable that my memory is at 90%.

6322
03:52:38,630 --> 03:52:40,290
That does not feel right.

6323
03:52:40,310 --> 03:52:41,590
I don't feel comfortable at all.

6324
03:52:41,970 --> 03:52:46,390
So I'm going to go grab it and see if I can find one that has 32 gigabytes per stick.

6325
03:52:46,710 --> 03:52:47,510
But it was fun.

6326
03:52:47,690 --> 03:52:48,490
I had a great time.

6327
03:52:48,550 --> 03:52:50,210
We kept the tradition up.

6328
03:52:50,450 --> 03:52:52,070
We finally did.

6329
03:52:52,530 --> 03:52:54,430
We skipped once.

6330
03:52:54,710 --> 03:52:55,570
Yeah, we skipped once.

6331
03:52:55,710 --> 03:52:57,190
That season doesn't matter.

6332
03:52:57,950 --> 03:52:59,330
That season doesn't matter.

6333
03:53:00,190 --> 03:53:03,590
This season had more stuff in it.

6334
03:53:03,670 --> 03:53:04,790
So it mattered more.

6335
03:53:05,090 --> 03:53:08,230
The last season didn't have as many updates as this season.

6336
03:53:08,230 --> 03:53:08,790
So...

6337
03:53:11,190 --> 03:53:12,350
But GG's, man.

6338
03:53:13,590 --> 03:53:14,090
GG's.

6339
03:53:14,170 --> 03:53:15,170
I will get my breakfast.

6340
03:53:15,510 --> 03:53:16,010
Alright.

6341
03:53:16,010 --> 03:53:16,530
Oh yeah.

6342
03:53:16,610 --> 03:53:17,670
It's breakfast time.

6343
03:53:17,790 --> 03:53:20,250
It is like 6.24 AM.

6344
03:53:20,470 --> 03:53:20,950
Jesus Christ.

6345
03:53:21,190 --> 03:53:21,450
Alright.

6346
03:53:21,890 --> 03:53:22,370
Alright.

6347
03:53:22,410 --> 03:53:23,210
But it's been great.

6348
03:53:23,470 --> 03:53:24,070
I had a great time.

6349
03:53:24,690 --> 03:53:26,050
I'll see you later, dude.

6350
03:53:26,770 --> 03:53:27,470
Yay, yay.

6351
03:53:27,510 --> 03:53:28,610
Thanks for inviting me.

6352
03:53:28,810 --> 03:53:28,870
Bye.

6353
03:53:29,310 --> 03:53:30,070
Of course.

6354
03:53:30,410 --> 03:53:32,130
Gotta keep that tradition up.

6355
03:53:32,250 --> 03:53:32,570
Alright.

6356
03:53:32,610 --> 03:53:33,010
Bye-bye.

6357
03:53:34,050 --> 03:53:34,710
Bye-bye.

6358
03:53:36,910 --> 03:53:37,410
Bye.

6359
03:53:37,410 --> 03:53:38,070
Well, that was fun.

6360
03:53:38,190 --> 03:53:42,590
I'm glad we have like tech support on the stream as we went along.

6361
03:53:42,950 --> 03:53:46,650
It definitely felt so much better compared to like...

6362
03:53:47,330 --> 03:53:51,550
It felt... The game felt so much better compared to like how it was in the beginning.

6363
03:53:51,810 --> 03:53:53,310
Because like the beginning was very rough.

6364
03:53:53,450 --> 03:53:55,310
It was very very rough.

6365
03:53:56,090 --> 03:53:56,590
So...

6366
03:53:57,190 --> 03:53:59,690
I'm happy we like fixed it a little bit.

6367
03:53:59,790 --> 03:54:01,930
I hope like it was still fun to watch even though...

6368
03:54:01,930 --> 03:54:03,170
Even though like...

6369
03:54:03,170 --> 03:54:04,690
The stream was really really rough.

6370
03:54:04,710 --> 03:54:07,690
I'm really scuffed as we went along.

6371
03:54:08,050 --> 03:54:13,150
So even though I hope you guys still enjoyed watching it with the stutters and everything.

6372
03:54:13,570 --> 03:54:14,670
So I'm sorry.

6373
03:54:15,730 --> 03:54:18,710
I told you guys I'm so unlucky.

6374
03:54:24,290 --> 03:54:26,750
I'm so unlucky.

6375
03:54:30,050 --> 03:54:31,570
But a great time!

6376
03:54:31,810 --> 03:54:32,630
I had a great time.

6377
03:54:32,630 --> 03:54:36,070
Today I'll go check out... I'll try and get the fix with the RAM today.

6378
03:54:36,910 --> 03:54:38,650
And get that over with.

6379
03:54:38,890 --> 03:54:43,110
But I'll see if I can put the RAM in myself.

6380
03:54:43,250 --> 03:54:44,730
I'll try my best everybody.

6381
03:54:45,470 --> 03:54:47,350
Anyway guys, I'm gonna call it here everybody.

6382
03:54:47,630 --> 03:54:52,130
As always everyone, stay hydrated, posture check, get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

6383
03:54:52,270 --> 03:54:54,390
And if you stay up for me, head to bed.

6384
03:54:54,570 --> 03:54:55,810
Because you deserve it.

6385
03:54:55,910 --> 03:54:56,890
I'll see you guys next time everybody.

6386
03:54:57,270 --> 03:54:57,810
Bye guys!

6387
03:54:59,170 --> 03:54:59,610
Bye!
