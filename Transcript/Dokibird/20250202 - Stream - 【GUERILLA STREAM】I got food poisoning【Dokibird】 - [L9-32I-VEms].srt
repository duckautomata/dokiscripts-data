21
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:53,040
The last time I've ever got Food poisoning was when I was a child

22
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:01,300
It was bad it was so Bad the food poisoning.

23
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:10,760
I was gonna stream on that day, too which sucked even more and I'm Tom my gosh, and I missed the The concert that's gonna okay.

24
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,400
So for those who don't know, I am in Sapporo.

25
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:13,620
I was in Sapporo

26
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:45,940
For the Japan ALGS, so I'm okay talking about it now cuz it's over so like I For those who don't know what ALGS is it is the biggest eSport LAN event for APEX and A lot of my friends were like you have to if you want to experience LAN for the first time You have to go to Sapporo because it might be technically it might be the last best one.

27
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,480
So I'm not sponsored or anything or endorsed for anything.

28
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:03,260
So I was just like Shit, it might be the last best land and like After that just might just be downhill from there.

29
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:13,960
So like I should experience it before it's too late You know before before, you know You know before things go downhill.

30
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:50,620
I might as well experience the best LAN APEX has ever done because I have no point of reference because I never been to a LAN before and So like and like I don't never been to an APEX LAN before let alone any LAN before so everything was like wow To me cuz like So that's why that's why I'm here I do I don't know if like it was a good decision Because like I got food poisoning and a lot of shit happened I was not okay.

31
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:53,040
I was not okay yesterday.

32
00:03:53,180 --> 00:04:00,560
I need you to know, um, I need you to know that I couldn't even keep liquids down.

33
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:05,020
Every time I tried to drink water, like, it was gone.

34
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:07,300
It was so bad.

35
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:12,280
I don't know how I was able to recover, like, in 24 hours.

36
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:24,400
I, like, was in bed since... I was in bed, like, the day before, starting at, like, 7 p.m., and then, like, I never got out of bed until...

37
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:33,720
Like, I mean, other than using the bathroom to, you know, fucking fix my food poisoning problem by expelling every goddamn thing in my mouth, um, in my stomach.

38
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:41,560
So, I was... I went to bed at 7 p.m.

39
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:50,760
because I was so tired, and maybe it was when the food poisoning was about to take effect, and I never got out of bed, other than, like, the use of the bathroom, until, like...

40
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,200
Oh, my God.

41
00:04:52,840 --> 00:05:01,780
Until, like, maybe, like, 4 in the morning, the next... the day after.

42
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:03,880
So, like, today.

43
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:12,260
So, it was, like... Okay, so, like, I'm talking in, like, JST time right now, so, like, people in NA might be really confused, but I'm talking in JST time.

44
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:15,160
So, like, until, like, 4 a.m.

45
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,420
JST, because I need... I was like, sponsor time!

46
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,100
For reals or no, no.

47
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:30,700
I was, um, I was sponsored to do a Minecraft co-casting with Mintz, and, uh, so I was like, I gotta be better by then.

48
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:40,820
I was like, I was so worried, because I was like, I gotta be okay before this fucking sponsor, because it's gonna be awkward as hell.

49
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:54,720
Um, so I had to do a sponsor stream on Twitch, um, and, yeah, because, like, I had to be on Twitch, because Mintz was gonna be on YouTube, and, um, we had to have one person on Twitch and one person on YouTube, so I was the one that's gonna be on Twitch,

50
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:04,380
and I was just like, oh, my God, I gotta... So, I didn't exist for, like, at least 24 hours, uh, yesterday, because I was so fucked up.

51
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:11,700
Uh, hahahaha, it's... Oh, my God, I sounded like, uh, that's called being a professional.

52
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,800
Also, because I was a lot better.

53
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:24,840
Um, okay, so, I'm gonna give you, like, I'll, I'll post, like, photos, I'll show you guys photos and stuff when I'm actually back back, and not, like, on my laptop.

54
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,340
Um, but I did take a lot of photos.

55
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:42,380
In the past, I had to wait for, like, photo perms, like, you know, ask, like, we would have to, like, ask, like, um, stores or, like, places I was at and stuff like that to be, like, can we show this place and shit like that.

56
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:49,700
Now, I'm in... Now that I'll be back in NA, I'd be like, I can show this whenever I want.

57
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:01,520
Anyway, um, because I'm just a little indie.

58
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:18,520
Anyway, um, um, and anyway, so, like, um, okay, I'm gonna give you guys... How do I feel about Apex Land?

59
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:24,080
I went to watch on the first day and the last day.

60
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,180
Okay, that's a lot.

61
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:36,120
I went to watch on the first day and a little bit on the third day and then last day and then all the other days I was shopping.

62
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:44,120
Okay, so, like, um, I was shopping.

63
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,100
It's the portal.

64
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:46,560
Whoa!

65
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:48,380
Shopping!

66
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:57,480
Um, okay, so, um, the reason why is that I realized, I was like, okay, this is so fucked up.

67
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:04,180
Like, I traveled all the way here to experience my first ever land, but, like, I'm, I'm fucking, it's like my stream, I'm not sponsored.

68
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,200
I realized, land's not my thing.

69
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:14,820
I traveled away and I was like, I've never done land before.

70
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:17,160
I'm like, whoa, I wonder what that's like.

71
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:22,720
And then I traveled away and I was like, oh man, I don't think land's my thing.

72
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,560
I was like, I was just like, oh man.

73
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:35,780
I was like, oh, this is not as, not as exciting as I, I think it's cause, like, I don't have a team I'm rooting for, too.

74
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,880
I was just like, oh my god, look, there's my friends over there, my friends over there, and my friends over there.

75
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:45,140
Um, and then I was just like, oh man.

76
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:50,360
And I also was like, super incognito mode, too, because I was so fucking paranoid.

77
00:08:50,960 --> 00:09:01,540
I did take a lot of secret photos, so like, and then, um, so like, I was just like, like, I didn't really have a team, team I'm explicitly rooting for.

78
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:07,040
I was just like, these are where all my friends team Fort was in, and stuff like that.

79
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:17,180
I, I did, like, in the finals, I rooted for Alliance, because it affects a Dragoon, so like, I was just sad, cause they were always, they always got, like, second place and stuff.

80
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,980
And so, um, the casting was so good.

81
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:31,520
I wouldn't know, I was at the venue, so I was listening to Japanese commentary, so I didn't, I wouldn't know, I didn't understand what they were saying.

82
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:44,140
I mean, I could have, like, I didn't want to pull up a stream to listen to English commentary while watching ALGS.

83
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:51,100
So, so like, I was just like, yeah, so I didn't know, guys.

84
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:57,540
Like, I had to, yeah, I was just watching it.

85
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:04,760
Um, so like, um, I, I, I mean, I did for, like, a little bit, but then I was like, this is stupid.

86
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:15,840
Like, I was like, I pulled up, like, B stream in the main channel, um, and like, to listen to a bit of the commentary, cause I was like, I don't know what's going on.

87
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:27,360
Like, I know what's going on, I'm, like, watching the gameplay, but I was just like, it's weird, it's like, I'm just, I feel like it's weird not listening to, like, casting I understand, because, like, you know, I don't understand Japanese, so I was like,

88
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:33,200
let me pull up English casting and just, um, just see how it works.

89
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:38,340
If, like, I put on my headphones and then let's, like, and pull up the stream and everything.

90
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,840
And then I was like, this is so fucking weird.

91
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:46,760
Like, I was like, that's so, it's so, that's so weird.

92
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,780
And then I was, like, wasting my phone's battery too, so I was just like, ah, I don't know.

93
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:58,440
I, I feel, like, fucking weird wasting my phone's battery as well.

94
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:09,400
And also, what's playing on the screen is not what's playing for, like, B-stream, because, you know, Wig's watching other people's POV.

95
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:15,740
So, like, I couldn't watch Wig's stream because he was fucking reacting to things that wasn't in front of me.

96
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:19,700
So I was like, I'm not gonna look at the B-stream while I'm here.

97
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:25,660
Like, I was like, I'm here.

98
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:30,340
Why the fuck am I watching my, like, my iPhone?

99
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:48,820
Just, I was just like, and then, like, you know, I could have, I could have also watched the main stream too as well, but it was just, it was weird, like, like, just listening on my headphones while, like, watching.

100
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,460
So I just, like, went, like, fuck it.

101
00:11:50,540 --> 00:12:00,300
I'll just, okay, so, like, the reason why I was like, oh, maybe Lan's not for me, because maybe it was, okay, like, I even watched the, because, okay, I tested it out.

102
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:09,660
I, I, like, tested it out for, like, three different days to, like, make sure if, like, I enjoyed Lan.

103
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:22,260
Because, like, I was like, if I don't enjoy it, like, I won't say I didn't enjoy it, but if I wasn't like, oh, yeah, woo, great time for, like, any of the three days, then I know, like, Lan's not for me.

104
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:33,600
So, like, the first day, like, it was not, it was not packed, obviously, but, like, because, like, it was just, like, regular group st- yeah, I needed to confirm, it was a scientific method.

105
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:37,380
I was, it was a scientific method.

106
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:47,300
I'm sorry, I, you might heard a little burp, like, apparently, that's a food poisoning side effect, and I usually am able to restrain it, because I don't burp.

107
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:51,420
I usually go, like, bop, but, like, oh, my stomach is not okay.

108
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:52,420
I...

109
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:03,040
Anyway, okay, anyway, I usually don't burp.

110
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:14,640
I never burp, and now I'm, like, you are a woman, Toki, that is so, oh, my God, suppress your madly urge.

111
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:39,140
Anyway, so, um, first day, it was the group stages, and then, like, I don't know, I guess there was, like, no stakes involved, like, no, like, uh, no, like, uh, nothing, like, too intense or anything, so, like, it was, it was alright, like, it was long.

112
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:43,660
Oh, my God, I stayed the entire day, because I, you know, I was, like, first day, yay!

113
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:49,250
And then, like, at the end, I was just, like, oh, first day.

114
00:13:54,230 --> 00:14:14,430
Because, like, I was, like, oh, man, I wanna know what that's like, you know, um, for the first day, so I was just, like, um, it was so long, it was, like, what, 12 games, and then there were so many, oh, my God, there were so many breaks, and, like, so many,

115
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:16,330
like, what's the word called?

116
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:37,190
Like, they had so many pauses and everything, and I was, like, oh, my God, how the, how do you, and then, like, I left in the middle of it, because there was, like, um, there was a place called Fan Zone, um, and it was, oh, yeah, like, intermission technical issues,

117
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:44,310
there were so many intermissions and technical issues, so I was just, like, oh, my God, like, ha!

118
00:14:44,310 --> 00:15:03,510
Oh, my God, no, there wasn't, there was more than, oh, sorry, it wasn't even 12 games, it was 18 games, I left after the second set, I was, like, I couldn't watch the third set, I was just, like, I can't, I forgot there was another six games afterwards,

119
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:10,470
I was, like, it was 18 games, and I was just, like, I can't, I'm not strong enough for that.

120
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:26,250
And so, like, I, like, left after the second set, because I was just, like, oh, my God, there's too many games, and so, like, I think it's just, okay, so then I, like, I was mostly spending my time after, like, the first, like, during the first and second set,

121
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:40,450
like, I left during the first and second set to go to the Fan Area to, like, look around, like, the, you know, the merch and stuff, the merch and, like, the Fan Zone and stuff like that.

122
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:56,950
It was really cool, I'll show you guys photos and everything, and, like, oh, my God, it was crazy, Fnatic's line was, every other booth was, like, almost empty, and then Fnatic's merch booth line, this was first day, by the way, was, like, so long, it was literally,

123
00:15:57,010 --> 00:16:05,370
like, like, it was looping, and, like, it was literally, like, the only line that was looping, and I felt so bad for them.

124
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:18,010
They had to look at Fnatic, yeah, because, like, they were literally on home turf, so, like, all the, um, all the JP, um, staff were, you know, not staff, JP people were there to support Fnatic and stuff.

125
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:25,770
Um, Powerball, thank you for the super chat, thank you, sorry if I can't read super chats, I literally, I'm just on my laptop, so it's even harder to look through, see it, but thank you so much.

126
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:31,650
Um, Saturday Night Everything went according to plan, but I still hope you enjoyed your trip, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

127
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:41,110
Um, yeah, I still enjoyed it, my trip, but it was just to see, like, if I liked it, experience, like, if I was ever going to go to land again, and I don't know, I feel like, no?

128
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:55,750
I don't know, because, like, um, this, like, I don't know if I, maybe, like, in a couple years, maybe I'll try another land, but, like, I don't know, like, I felt like, if I didn't, like, I enjoyed it, but, like, I knew it was not going to happen.

129
00:16:55,750 --> 00:17:09,410
Not for me, and I felt like if Apex couldn't do it for me, then, like, I just think, like, I just personally don't have, like, I just personally might not enjoy land, like, not enjoy land, but I might personally not, like, be a land person.

130
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:26,710
Um, maybe it's because I was also, like, by myself, too, so... I was so paranoid, I was so fucking... I actually, I even got into the player lounge, too, because I had, like, a special ticket, um, so, like, um, so I had access to, like, basically, like,

131
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:30,750
the places where players have access to, and I felt so...

132
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:40,850
Like, I didn't say hi to anybody, but I saw, like, I saw, like, everybody, like, there, like, all, like, the famous Apex players were just hanging out.

133
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:55,330
By the way, like, the lounge isn't, is not that, like, oh, my God, the lounge, it was not that fancy, it was literally just a room filled with players, and there was, like, a little, like, snack area, but apparently, from what they told me, from what my friends told me,

134
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:59,370
like, the food assortment, like, the free food was not great.

135
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:14,110
Because, like, it was, like, super greasy and made people, like, bloated and stuff, so, like, people were just, like, going for, like, konbini food and stuff like that, because, like, eating it was not, didn't feel so good during games.

136
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:21,450
So, like, um, so, like, people, they were just, like, yeah, it's not, not it, and stuff, like, not performance food.

137
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:35,670
Uh, so, like, yeah, that's why, like, I didn't eat any of the lounge food, because I was, like, when I looked at it, I was just, like, oh, it looks a lot, it looks, like, like, not, like, ugh, but, like, I was, like, oh, that looks a lot.

138
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:37,330
I did sneak a bread in.

139
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,050
I was just, like, going to cut my bread.

140
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:53,470
I was just, like, um, um, yeah, but I did was, um, and I saw, like, you know, I saw a lot of the famous players there.

141
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:55,950
I didn't say hi, but, like, I saw them.

142
00:18:55,950 --> 00:19:08,450
I sneaked a photo of, like, a, like, the Dragoon plush in the player lounge, and, like, I'm pretty sure nobody recognized me.

143
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:12,990
I was just, I was, like, I was, like, and then I hit the Dragoon plushie instantly.

144
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:16,910
I was, like, oh, they don't know I'm a VTuber in your lounge right now.

145
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:18,950
I don't even belong here.

146
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:21,410
I'm not even a player.

147
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:30,630
I sneaked in a little quick photo.

148
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:39,430
Um, um, anyway, so, yeah, I felt like a stalker, not gonna lie, I really did.

149
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:45,790
Um, oh, my gosh, okay, so, like, uh, so, like I said, I also went to the third day.

150
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:46,870
I think it was the third day.

151
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:49,470
It was, which, yeah, it was the first elimination round.

152
00:19:49,470 --> 00:20:05,230
I went to the first elimination round, and, like, it got a little better because, you know, teams were getting eliminated, but it was, like, I was just, like, it still didn't feel like, you know, stakes were there yet, and I just didn't feel, oh, so Sapporo was so fucking cold.

153
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:09,430
It not, it's not just, not, it wasn't, like, so fucking cold.

154
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:11,610
It snowed every day.

155
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,710
Like, I think that was the worst part for me.

156
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:19,550
Like, um, it did, for some reason, it wasn't as cold as I thought it was gonna be, um, for the fact that it was snowing.

157
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:23,330
I felt like it was more, it was colder in Canada, for sure, for me.

158
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:28,410
Um, but, like, it's just snow, no, it, like, we're, it's colder in Canada.

159
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:39,470
I feel colder in Canada, but, like, Sapporo snows every day, and it sucked for me because, like, I wanted to, like, explore and walk around.

160
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:46,910
I just took cabs every day because I, I couldn't, I could not walk outside in the snow.

161
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:52,330
It was, like, you would think it was, like, little snow, but, like, it was a lot.

162
00:20:54,110 --> 00:21:03,690
And, like, the sidewalk, like, in Canada, we salt our, we salt the roads and the sidewalks and everything.

163
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:09,750
I think because it snows so much in Sapporo, they don't salt the roads a lot.

164
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:14,610
It's not, like, salted as normally because it snows way too much.

165
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:31,110
So, um, so, like, there was, like, areas where it was just snow, and I was, like, wow, wow, trying to make sure I don't fucking slip and kill myself, I guess, like, I was just, like, wow.

166
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:47,810
So then I gave up walking around and, like, I gave up walking around and I had to, I had to, like, get a cab.

167
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:50,910
And I was just, like, everywhere because I was, like, I need to go here.

168
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:53,450
And then it was just, it was rough.

169
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:54,330
It was very rough.

170
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:07,130
And then, because, like, okay, one time, one time, also, like, I bumped into one of the players on a date.

171
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:22,470
Because, you know, one of the days I didn't go watch, I didn't go watch the ALGS matches.

172
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:24,870
I was just, like, shopping time, wow!

173
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:32,570
So, well, it wasn't the players, it was, like, one of the staff members.

174
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:41,290
So, so, but it was funny, because I, like, snitched them out to the team.

175
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:50,690
Okay, I won't say which team, I won't say which team, but, like, it was so funny.

176
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:56,930
But, okay, so, like, I decided to, like, I was, I was gonna, I was not gonna go watch the game that day.

177
00:22:57,050 --> 00:23:01,050
And then I was, like, I'm gonna go shopping, I'm gonna walk around and go shopping.

178
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:13,410
And, and then, so, I was walking around Sapporo, near where the players are.

179
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:15,990
So, like, there's, like, a players hotel.

180
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:21,890
And I was walking around, like, a district that was near the players hotel, because there's a lot of stuff there.

181
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:27,430
There's a lot of stories and stuff, and, like, I just wanted to walk around.

182
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:32,910
And I was, like, oh, I wanna go to the Village Vanguard and stuff, because there's a lot of, like, things I enjoy.

183
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:41,090
Like, you know, Village Vanguard has, like, a lot of, like, Village Vanguard is, like, Hot Topic, but in Japan, but a better version of Hot Topic.

184
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:48,030
Um, so, like, there was a lot more, like, you know, like, pop culture stuff and cute stuff going inside.

185
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:49,770
I need to, like, grab my water.

186
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:59,330
And, uh, so, like, uh, basically, the worst part was that, you know, it didn't seem like it was snowing.

187
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:04,930
So, I was, like, okay, I'm gonna take a cab to this spot, and I'm gonna walk around.

188
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:17,110
And then the moment I, like, you know, finished, uh, the moment I got, like, finished shopping at, uh, at a Village Vanguard, um, it started snowing.

189
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:23,370
And then I was, like, ah, fuck, okay, um, this is fucking awkward.

190
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:27,010
So then I was, like, okay, I'm gonna walk around a little bit and just see how I feel.

191
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:32,570
And I walked, I took, like, I literally walked, like, you know, across the street, and I was, like, it's over.

192
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:33,690
Like...

193
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:39,570
I was, like, I can't.

194
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:41,450
I can't do this.

195
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:43,030
I'm not strong enough.

196
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:51,010
So, um, I was, like, oh my gosh, I can't do this.

197
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:51,670
I can't.

198
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:52,790
I'm not strong enough.

199
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:59,810
And then I was just, like, it was just bad.

200
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:01,710
It was just snowing way too much.

201
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:03,750
Like, it was not, like, small snow.

202
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:08,790
It was, like, like, you know, like, it was a lot of snow while it was snowing down.

203
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:12,750
Like, I couldn't get my phone out and look at my phone because the snow would just cover my phone.

204
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:15,650
Like, or, like, it'd just make my phone all wet.

205
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:20,810
Like, just for, like, if I had my phone out for, like, five seconds, my entire phone would just be wet.

206
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:23,850
So I was just, like, it's so hot.

207
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:27,710
I was, like, oh, man, this is, uh, this is fucking rough.

208
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:32,730
It's, like, oh, man.

209
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:40,150
And then, so, um, so then the worst part was that very moment, because I was, like, I'm going to take an Uber.

210
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:43,050
I'm going to take an Uber back to my hotel and just be warm.

211
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:53,730
And then, but the worst part was that, um, um, the worst part was just the fact that that exact moment my data stopped working.

212
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:59,290
So I was, like, trying to find a place to, like, mooch off.

213
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:00,130
I don't know why.

214
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:02,250
It was just that exact moment.

215
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:04,250
I told you I was so unlucky during this entire trip.

216
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:07,310
Like, this exact moment, I just didn't have internet.

217
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:08,250
I just didn't have data.

218
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:09,370
I don't know why.

219
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:10,630
Like, it was working earlier.

220
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:13,010
It was working during, like, when I was shopping.

221
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:18,370
And then, like, suddenly, I just, when I went out in the snow, my data just stopped working.

222
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:20,630
And then I was just, like, oh, no.

223
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:23,370
Where is my internet?

224
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:24,790
Oh, no.

225
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:28,750
So, like, I found, like, this dessert place.

226
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:33,870
Like, I found, like, I was, like, I need to find a cafe or something to mooch off the internet so I can call an Uber.

227
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:39,270
And, um, and, like, I found this, like, cafe dessert place.

228
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:40,530
And then I went in.

229
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:41,930
I was, like, oh, this is cute.

230
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:42,750
And then they have internet.

231
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:43,830
So I was, like, yippee.

232
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:46,090
I was, like, okay, I'm gonna grab something small to eat.

233
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:49,930
And then, like, after I finish eating, I'm gonna call an Uber.

234
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:53,710
And this is where I accidentally stumbled upon a date.

235
00:26:58,430 --> 00:27:05,410
So, okay, so, like, um, I didn't realize someone was on a date until, like, because they were on the other side.

236
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:06,930
I was, like, I wasn't, I didn't care.

237
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:15,930
Like, obviously, I wasn't, like, eavesdropping or anything because I was, like, too focused on, like, um, on, like, you know, on my phone and, like, eating my food.

238
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:19,430
And then I heard, and I was wearing my headphones, too.

239
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:27,150
And then I heard what the guy was, like, talking about eSports and, like, uh, Apex.

240
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:30,570
And, obviously, my ears perked up.

241
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:32,810
And I was, like, huh?

242
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:34,610
In English?

243
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:44,310
And, obviously, you know, it was a white guy in, like, in Japan.

244
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:48,890
So, like, you're more, you know, we're, like, what are you doing here?

245
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:50,630
You know, I can blend in because I'm Asian.

246
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:53,950
So, like, um, so it was, like, huh?

247
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:55,230
Hmm.

248
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:05,330
And then, but he was, like, on, uh, he was on a date with, like, a JP girl.

249
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:08,130
And then, I think it was, like, a JP Apex girl.

250
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:10,330
And then I was just, like, whoa.

251
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:15,210
And then, like, you know, I paid my, I paid my bill.

252
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:19,510
And, um, um, I paid my bill.

253
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:25,170
And then I walked past, not over to them, and be, like, hey, I know you, like, what are you guys talking about?

254
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:26,430
Like, I'm not that creepy.

255
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:27,330
But, like, okay.

256
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:31,830
And then, you know, I, like, like, I, like, you know, I finished eating.

257
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:34,170
And then, like, I got my Uber.

258
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:35,170
And then I left.

259
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:39,890
But then before I left, I, like, glanced over to be, like, maybe if I reckon, do I recognize this person?

260
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:42,810
Because, you know, I know, like, a lot of, like, Apex pro players.

261
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:45,510
And then I didn't sit next to him, I was on the other side.

262
00:28:45,610 --> 00:28:47,650
I was on the other side.

263
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:52,570
And then, so, like, I, like, walked over just to see.

264
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:57,170
And then I saw them wearing a team sweater.

265
00:28:57,850 --> 00:29:00,790
And then I was like, oh, my God, I won't say the team.

266
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:02,470
I won't say, I'm not gonna rat them out.

267
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:04,610
Like, I just thought it was a funny experience.

268
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:06,910
And then, like, I was like, oh, my God, wait.

269
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:10,930
Oh, my God, it is an Apex player.

270
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:13,170
Or, like, I don't know, an Apex player or an Apex staff.

271
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:16,230
I know it wasn't an Apex player, because I knew all the people on the team.

272
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:19,590
So then I was like, so then I messaged one of the team members.

273
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:24,850
And I was like, I think I bumped into one of your staff, like, going on a date.

274
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:31,910
Doki, you need to learn to mind your own business.

275
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:34,730
Oh, I'm sorry, I was curious, okay?

276
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:38,290
I was like, I was so curious, okay?

277
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:42,030
I was just like, whoa, oh, my God, gossip.

278
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:50,250
Okay, and then, snitch!

279
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:52,390
Okay, not in public, though.

280
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:53,950
Okay, I just thought it was funny.

281
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:57,070
I thought it was really funny.

282
00:29:57,650 --> 00:30:04,610
And then, so, like, I messaged one of the team members, and I was like, I think I saw one of your staff members on a date.

283
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:08,370
And they're like, we can't be, and they're like, wait, what?

284
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:10,610
Like, they're talking about team members?

285
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:12,370
I was like, no, no, no, no, no.

286
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:16,610
I'm pretty sure it's one of your staff, because, like, I recognize your team members.

287
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:18,730
And they're like, oh, it can't be that guy, obviously.

288
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:22,890
And then they showed a picture, and I was like, oh, my God, that's him!

289
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:30,770
And then he was like, my friend was like, oh, my God, he's supposed to be at the booth right now, managing our merch store.

290
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:35,630
And I was like, are you sure?

291
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:39,990
I was like, oh, I'm pretty sure that was the guy I saw on the date.

292
00:30:45,170 --> 00:30:48,070
I was like, I don't know, I'm pretty sure.

293
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:56,630
He was near the Players Hotel, and, like, the place I was at was near the Players Hotel, and that's supposed to be a secret.

294
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:05,950
And, like, I don't know, some tall white guy in Japan is sort of, like, hard to miss.

295
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,320
So he's like, are you sure?

296
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,280
And I was like, yeah, I'm pretty sure.

297
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:32,500
I just thought it was funny, I was like... I thought that was really funny, I was like...

298
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:42,880
How was I supposed to know he had responsibilities at the arena?

299
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,900
How the fuck was I supposed to know that?

300
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:49,780
I was like, oh my gosh, bro, I caught him on a date, bro!

301
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:55,260
And he's like, wait, he's supposed to be back at the arena right now.

302
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:59,780
Gas, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

303
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:01,260
Wow, bro, at least scored.

304
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:06,880
I mean, I saw him pay for... okay, like, it sounds so bad, it feels like I was, like, watching them.

305
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:10,520
But literally when I was about... when I was leaving, I saw him pay for the meals.

306
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:15,920
And she seemed really happy, so I'm pretty sure he was in.

307
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:24,800
I'm pretty sure... I'm pretty sure he was in at that point.

308
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:35,820
You guys are like my diaries, like, dear diary, today I saw a bitch going on a date when he was supposed to be at the arena.

309
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:46,430
Anyway, I thought that was really funny.

310
00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:48,450
Okay, so, like, the last day.

311
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:53,010
Okay, so I watched the last day, which was technically today.

312
00:32:53,530 --> 00:32:59,150
And, like, I didn't do the opening ceremony for it because that was way too early.

313
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:00,570
I was like, I need to sleep.

314
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:05,050
I couldn't be bothered going to... I think, like, I showed up because it looked really cool.

315
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:12,830
Because I watched the opening ceremony on the... on, like, in my hotel room.

316
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:17,910
On my phone, I watched.

317
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:21,230
And I was just like, oh my gosh, it's way too early.

318
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:24,810
Like, I just couldn't be bothered.

319
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:31,610
Because I was like, okay, for those who don't know Apex LAN, Apex ALGS tournaments or esports.

320
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:40,290
Basically, there's no X amount of games.

321
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:44,310
It is called match point finals.

322
00:33:44,310 --> 00:34:00,030
So what that means is that when a team hits 50 points, whichever team wins with 50, like, at the threshold of 50 points wins the whole entire thing.

323
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:04,530
But the thing is, it could take a very long time.

324
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:16,230
And like, I came in late, not like super late, but like, I like, I think, like, third game, like, by the end of third game, I was there.

325
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:19,990
And then like, oh my god, it was so long.

326
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:21,810
It was so long.

327
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:26,930
I was like, oh my god.

328
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:30,070
It went to, it was nine games.

329
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:34,510
It was, it was nine games.

330
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:40,050
I was like, and there were like, delays to apparently there was like an hour delay and everything.

331
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:43,050
Because like, PCs were not working.

332
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:45,930
They had people at the swap PCs and stuff like that.

333
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:49,010
At one point, it took like one hour to start game three.

334
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:57,390
So, so like, I waited until that delay was over before I went over.

335
00:34:57,810 --> 00:35:04,510
Because I was like, I was like, bro, oh my god, when is this issue gonna be fixed?

336
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:07,570
I'm not coming over when they're still trying to fix PC issues.

337
00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:13,870
So like, I, I was like, I waited until like game three got delayed for one hour at least.

338
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:16,970
Um, so I was just like, oh my gosh.

339
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:23,410
Oh, yeah, there's a there was a lot of like SSD issues, apparently, or like graphics card issues from what I've heard.

340
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:32,570
So at one point, um, um, I know like this happened to like several teams, but like, basically, like, teams were getting walls.

341
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:35,430
Like, like, oh my god, they're hacking.

342
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:43,150
But like, because like the SSD was failing, because they don't talk about it on obviously don't say on stream what it was, but like, I got the insider knowledge.

343
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:55,750
So like, the SSD was failing to the point where like, um, players ended up getting walls and stuff.

344
00:35:56,190 --> 00:36:03,130
And like, like, so like, they could see everything and then they would, you know, they'll be like, I have walls.

345
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:14,250
So that's why like, some of them stopped the game because they're like, oh, fuck, like, bro, he got walls.

346
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:21,050
Um, so apparently, that happened several times.

347
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:23,010
And then assets weren't loaded yet.

348
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:28,470
Mike, there was like microphone issues and stuff like that from some teams as well.

349
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:31,530
And then just like graphics cards were failing and stuff like that.

350
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:32,790
So they had to swap it up.

351
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:37,830
Um, I know it's five days from now, but I think I've worked that day and I don't want to miss it.

352
00:36:37,850 --> 00:36:38,910
Happy anniversary, Doki.

353
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:40,690
Thank you, the super chat's upside down.

354
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:41,750
Thank you, thank you.

355
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:47,590
So like, that, um, yeah, that's crazy that it happened in LAN too.

356
00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:52,990
Like, that's actually like the probability of that happening in LAN several times too.

357
00:36:52,990 --> 00:37:08,490
Apparently, like, um, I heard that like, cause there was a biggest issue with like, um, I think like it was NIG where like, I think it was Fun had, um, basically, uh, they had, they kicked him out on the first time that happened.

358
00:37:08,650 --> 00:37:10,290
And then the second time they let them back in.

359
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:21,410
But it happened to that specific bug happened to him twice on two different PCs, which is so fucked if you think about it.

360
00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:28,610
Like, I was like, how does that happen twice to the same person on different days?

361
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:29,130
Yeah.

362
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:30,510
I was like, Oh my God.

363
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:32,590
The first time it happened, they just kicked him out.

364
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:36,830
Like, cause they're like, well, you have walls and the PC crashed.

365
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:39,790
And then the second time they're like, okay, that's weird.

366
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:40,090
All right.

367
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:41,970
We're just gonna try and let you back in.

368
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:43,190
Yeah.

369
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:46,950
So, um, that's crazy.

370
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:58,550
The fact that like, that guy got like two different PCs on two different days and it still happened was like, what kind of luck do you have to have that happen?

371
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:09,470
And, um, and then apparently during like the one hour delay, like it was like POIs where they gave wrong POIs, PCs were not working.

372
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:13,230
So they were restarting it over and over and over again.

373
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:20,930
And because like teams were also experiencing the walls glitch as well, like getting walls and stuff and, um, assets disappeared.

374
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:26,510
Like, and then like, but obviously at that time during the third game, during finals, they fixed all that issue.

375
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:29,790
And then like, there wasn't any intermission and pauses anymore.

376
00:38:29,930 --> 00:38:31,590
Thank fucking God.

377
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:38,330
Cause like, I was slowly, I was, I was slowly having my life sucked away from me watching that, watching nine games.

378
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:41,990
Like I didn't even watch nine games cause I showed up after game three.

379
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:48,890
Um, I showed up after game three.

380
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:51,990
So I was having my life sucked out after game three.

381
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:55,670
So like at first I was like, whoa, yeah, baby.

382
00:38:56,050 --> 00:38:58,590
And then, you know, it got to game five.

383
00:38:58,590 --> 00:39:00,130
I was like, whoa, baby.

384
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:01,790
That's what's getting along.

385
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:04,330
And then we had to scheme sounds like, oh, okay.

386
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:05,310
Whoa.

387
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:06,530
Okay.

388
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:08,490
And then game eight.

389
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:09,710
I'm like, oh my God.

390
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:10,690
Match point finals.

391
00:39:10,970 --> 00:39:11,750
So stupid.

392
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:17,670
I think it's not going to lie.

393
00:39:17,810 --> 00:39:22,750
I feel like it's more exciting if you're watching from home with match point finals, but like, I don't know.

394
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:27,070
It was just, that's why I was like, um, um, that's all.

395
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:28,810
I was just like, oh man.

396
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:34,970
Like for me, I was like, maybe that's not for me because I feel like for others be like, yeah, match point finals.

397
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:36,770
It's so exciting.

398
00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:43,150
But like for me, I was just like, I used to be like, oh my God, more tournaments to do match point finals.

399
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:49,950
But like, I think if I was there since the more, like since game one, I'd be so fucking dead.

400
00:39:53,410 --> 00:39:57,730
I'd be like so fucking dead by game nine.

401
00:40:00,770 --> 00:40:03,630
I was just like, oh my God.

402
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:05,490
I was just like, oh shit.

403
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:15,210
Maybe I think I just need, I think also like now I know what it's like watching LAN, like, you know, by myself versus I maybe I need to experience it.

404
00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:17,610
Cause someone's like, oh yeah, I experienced watching LAN with friends.

405
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:23,350
And the thing is, the problem is that all my friends at LAN are like famous.

406
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:26,410
So I was worried.

407
00:40:29,610 --> 00:40:31,170
Cause I was like, okay.

408
00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:34,370
So I was trying to like, I tried to like meet up with like, okay.

409
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:39,470
So one of the people I tried to meet up with was, um, um, was Effect.

410
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:43,770
But like, I was just like, oh man, like, I was just like, bro, I can't.

411
00:40:43,850 --> 00:40:47,070
You're like, Alliance is like so fucking famous in Japan.

412
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:47,950
It's actually crazy.

413
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:51,270
Um, there's so many like Alliance fangirls.

414
00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:53,310
Like I was like, oh my, okay.

415
00:40:53,390 --> 00:41:02,590
So like one of the, one of the people I sat next to during like one of those days and, um, I never got a chance to meet Effect because like we just kept missing each other.

416
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:08,850
And like, I was going to do like, I was like, okay, like obviously I cannot meet you in a public place.

417
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:10,070
You're taking, you're getting photos.

418
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:15,550
Like I would like bump, like I wouldn't bump into them, but I would like pass them by and stuff.

419
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:19,750
And then like, I just see them getting mobbed every time.

420
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:31,070
So, so like they would like go out and then they would go to like the public area and then people would like ask for photos and stuff like that.

421
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:31,990
So I saw that.

422
00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:33,750
I was like, I can't do that.

423
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:40,190
I was like, I can't do that.

424
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:42,570
Like that's, that's way too crazy.

425
00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:47,970
So, um, and so like, no, but it's crazy.

426
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:48,230
Okay.

427
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:49,450
So like some, okay.

428
00:41:49,450 --> 00:41:56,310
So I sat next to a group of Alliance fangirls and like, um, they were like super passionate and then like, but I think they were all there for unlucky.

429
00:41:56,310 --> 00:41:59,310
And then I, because how do I know?

430
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:02,650
Because I looked over cause they were like super passionate about Alliance.

431
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:07,570
So I looked over and then like their phone wallpapers was just unlucky.

432
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:13,190
Like, you know, like idols and stuff like they're basically idols to like, I think in Japan.

433
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:21,590
Um, so like, and then like, um, so I was like, whoa, okay.

434
00:42:22,330 --> 00:42:22,810
Yeah.

435
00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:23,150
Yeah.

436
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:28,470
Like there was a, there's a guy, uh, in the guys, like he has got to have no kids.

437
00:42:28,610 --> 00:42:36,050
So like, um, he's single too, by the way, ladies and men, he is single.

438
00:42:40,010 --> 00:42:43,770
So, um, so, um, so like, yeah.

439
00:42:43,990 --> 00:42:48,010
Um, um, and he's a roller player.

440
00:42:51,690 --> 00:42:52,050
Yeah.

441
00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:59,450
So, um, um, anyway, anyway, I thought it was like, I thought it was really cute.

442
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:01,210
Like they were like super passionate.

443
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:02,910
It was super cute.

444
00:43:03,110 --> 00:43:05,250
And so like, I was like, okay.

445
00:43:05,330 --> 00:43:07,550
And then I was going to do like something really stupid.

446
00:43:07,770 --> 00:43:12,830
I didn't do it because I was like, uh, and then like, if I was like, oh yeah, we had like an unofficial meeting.

447
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:14,090
And I was like, oh shit.

448
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:14,390
Okay.

449
00:43:14,390 --> 00:43:16,190
And then like my gears were turning.

450
00:43:16,210 --> 00:43:17,010
I was like, where is it?

451
00:43:17,150 --> 00:43:20,010
Cause I was going to be like, pretend to be a fan.

452
00:43:20,010 --> 00:43:24,970
And then like afterwards, just be like, haha, you actually met me.

453
00:43:25,170 --> 00:43:33,230
And then, but like, I would not say anything until like, I wanted to like, you know, like be like, oh, that's right.

454
00:43:33,330 --> 00:43:37,510
That random person you met in that giant meet and greet, it was me.

455
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:40,110
I was going to do that cause I thought it was super funny.

456
00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:44,970
Um, and then like, but then he gave me the wrong fucking instructions.

457
00:43:44,970 --> 00:43:52,870
Uh, it was me, Barry.

458
00:43:54,390 --> 00:43:55,850
So I was going to do that.

459
00:43:57,790 --> 00:44:03,990
Um, and, uh, I couldn't because I was like, where the fuck is this unofficial meet and greet?

460
00:44:04,190 --> 00:44:06,950
And then he was like, oh, it's like in the main entrance.

461
00:44:06,950 --> 00:44:08,090
And I was like, all right.

462
00:44:08,110 --> 00:44:11,290
And then like, I was walking around and I was like, where the fuck is this?

463
00:44:11,290 --> 00:44:16,950
Like, cause I wanted to get there early cause I knew it was going to get like, um, it was going to be like a lot of people.

464
00:44:17,250 --> 00:44:19,870
And then, um, no, I would put on a voice.

465
00:44:19,890 --> 00:44:21,790
Like I would always put on a voice for it.

466
00:44:21,970 --> 00:44:24,310
Uh, so like people won't like recognize.

467
00:44:24,490 --> 00:44:27,930
Anyway, so, um, I also didn't talk a lot cause I thought I was scared.

468
00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:35,730
Um, anyway, so, and then, but I saw Timmy's line.

469
00:44:35,890 --> 00:44:37,310
Oh my God.

470
00:44:37,470 --> 00:44:39,710
Timmy's line was fucking crazy.

471
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:41,630
I'll show you guys pictures when I'm back.

472
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:43,050
Like I took a picture of the line.

473
00:44:43,330 --> 00:44:52,430
I just took four, I took three different photos to illustrate how long Timmy's line was.

474
00:44:52,530 --> 00:44:53,850
It's Timmy's line, it's Timmy.

475
00:44:53,910 --> 00:44:56,870
He wasn't even playing in the champs.

476
00:44:57,330 --> 00:44:59,190
He wasn't even playing in champs.

477
00:44:59,270 --> 00:45:00,810
I was like, how the fuck?

478
00:45:02,290 --> 00:45:04,910
He got, his team got fucking knocked out.

479
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:10,030
Like, so, so like, like, okay.

480
00:45:10,490 --> 00:45:22,650
So his line was like, if, if I, I needed to take four to five photos to illustrate how long his line was.

481
00:45:22,790 --> 00:45:23,750
I took three.

482
00:45:29,530 --> 00:45:33,870
I literally was like, there's one of the, here's one set.

483
00:45:33,870 --> 00:45:35,890
There's another set and there's Timmy.

484
00:45:37,210 --> 00:45:42,510
I could have taken two more photos to illustrate how long his line was.

485
00:45:42,670 --> 00:45:45,330
And I was like, thinking in my head, they don't know.

486
00:45:45,450 --> 00:45:48,950
Timmy once raided me for Marvel Rivals and I played with him before.

487
00:45:49,230 --> 00:45:52,930
And it was the most embarrassing moment when I played with him because I wasn't listening.

488
00:45:54,230 --> 00:45:56,010
Those people don't know that.

489
00:45:57,150 --> 00:45:59,430
And I saw him in the player lounge.

490
00:45:59,550 --> 00:46:00,910
I didn't do anything about it though.

491
00:46:00,930 --> 00:46:01,790
I just saw him.

492
00:46:09,030 --> 00:46:09,830
Press Q.

493
00:46:10,330 --> 00:46:10,930
Yeah, anyway.

494
00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:13,390
So there were so many lines.

495
00:46:13,530 --> 00:46:14,930
There were so many fucking lines.

496
00:46:15,010 --> 00:46:15,530
Oh my God.

497
00:46:15,610 --> 00:46:17,450
I was going to go crazy at the amount of lines.

498
00:46:21,850 --> 00:46:25,550
Anyway, so the secret, I felt like a stalker at that point.

499
00:46:25,930 --> 00:46:27,770
So like, there was that.

500
00:46:28,110 --> 00:46:28,370
And okay.

501
00:46:28,430 --> 00:46:30,650
So anyway, so anyway, I was like, the fuck?

502
00:46:30,730 --> 00:46:33,590
And then like, I was like, where the fuck is this?

503
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:34,990
Unofficial meet and greet.

504
00:46:35,130 --> 00:46:40,370
And then when Effect said main entrance, it was actually outside.

505
00:46:42,170 --> 00:46:46,770
I was like, oh my God, the most critical information I did not receive.

506
00:46:46,850 --> 00:46:50,630
I literally waited in the arena for like, at least 30 minutes.

507
00:46:50,770 --> 00:46:52,210
Because I was like, where the fuck?

508
00:46:52,410 --> 00:46:53,490
Where is this?

509
00:46:53,910 --> 00:46:55,310
And then like, I went out.

510
00:46:55,430 --> 00:46:58,650
And then obviously, I see the alliance meet and greet.

511
00:46:59,230 --> 00:47:00,350
It was so fucking long.

512
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:02,710
It was like, it was just like a circle of people.

513
00:47:03,590 --> 00:47:07,890
It was like, there was so many people there.

514
00:47:07,990 --> 00:47:11,310
I was like, oh my God, I am not.

515
00:47:11,630 --> 00:47:12,650
I'm not gonna.

516
00:47:12,970 --> 00:47:13,550
I'm not.

517
00:47:13,710 --> 00:47:14,690
I'm sorry, bro.

518
00:47:16,190 --> 00:47:17,250
I'm sorry.

519
00:47:17,450 --> 00:47:19,330
It was, I'm not doing that.

520
00:47:19,790 --> 00:47:22,210
I'm not lining up in the fucking cord.

521
00:47:28,010 --> 00:47:30,190
So it wasn't even the main entrance.

522
00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:35,450
It was outside, and you gotta walk a little bit off of the main entrance.

523
00:47:36,090 --> 00:47:38,210
And then, because it was where the ice sculptures were.

524
00:47:38,690 --> 00:47:43,210
And like, the ice sculptures were like, you gotta walk like, at least one to two minutes to get there.

525
00:47:43,270 --> 00:47:44,130
It's not even the main entrance.

526
00:47:44,250 --> 00:47:45,850
I was like, you could have said outside.

527
00:47:47,470 --> 00:47:50,690
You could have said, the ice sculptures, you know?

528
00:47:50,970 --> 00:47:52,190
Like, oh my God.

529
00:47:52,230 --> 00:47:56,290
And then I went there, and I was just like, Jesus fucking Christ, this is a mob.

530
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:02,750
So I was like, fuck it, peace, I'm out.

531
00:48:03,230 --> 00:48:04,410
I'm going back.

532
00:48:04,510 --> 00:48:05,490
I'm getting dinner.

533
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:14,850
I was just like, fucking peace.

534
00:48:15,090 --> 00:48:18,090
I like, snapped a photo of like, his back.

535
00:48:18,290 --> 00:48:19,930
I was like, I tried my best.

536
00:48:20,430 --> 00:48:22,050
This is the closest I could get.

537
00:48:22,270 --> 00:48:23,630
And then I sent it over.

538
00:48:24,170 --> 00:48:24,990
I sent it over.

539
00:48:25,050 --> 00:48:26,590
By the way, if you guys didn't know, Effect is a dragon.

540
00:48:26,990 --> 00:48:28,730
And then like, I sent it over.

541
00:48:28,730 --> 00:48:31,530
And then I was just like, this is the closest I could get.

542
00:48:31,790 --> 00:48:32,650
Like, fuck you, man.

543
00:48:33,930 --> 00:48:35,450
And it's like, no!

544
00:48:39,970 --> 00:48:43,270
And then Effect, like, messaged back after the meeting, he's like, no!

545
00:48:50,770 --> 00:48:55,950
I literally sent a picture of like, I took a picture of like, the fucking back, his back.

546
00:48:56,090 --> 00:48:57,430
And like, with a fan.

547
00:48:57,530 --> 00:48:58,610
And I was like, here you go.

548
00:49:05,190 --> 00:49:08,490
Yeah, so, now I look like this.

549
00:49:11,450 --> 00:49:13,270
You should have been more specific!

550
00:49:17,250 --> 00:49:18,370
Oh my god.

551
00:49:18,710 --> 00:49:22,430
You could have had an unofficial meet and greet with DokiBrit.

552
00:49:25,130 --> 00:49:26,330
Actually, he wouldn't have known.

553
00:49:26,410 --> 00:49:27,390
I would have been like, oh!

554
00:49:28,030 --> 00:49:30,510
One of those fans you met was me!

555
00:49:30,810 --> 00:49:32,190
I was gonna do that anyway.

556
00:49:32,190 --> 00:49:33,550
So like, you wouldn't have...

557
00:49:33,550 --> 00:49:36,110
It wouldn't have won either way for him.

558
00:49:38,870 --> 00:49:41,990
Cause I wasn't even gonna tell him.

559
00:49:47,730 --> 00:49:48,490
Anyway...

560
00:49:48,490 --> 00:49:52,010
But which one?

561
00:49:56,750 --> 00:49:59,290
Anyway, so like...

562
00:49:59,290 --> 00:50:00,470
So like, okay.

563
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:02,130
So yeah, like, match point final.

564
00:50:02,150 --> 00:50:02,670
Oh my gosh.

565
00:50:02,770 --> 00:50:04,230
It was just...

566
00:50:04,230 --> 00:50:05,990
By the way, it was so funny.

567
00:50:06,630 --> 00:50:09,390
Because like, I had a friend who was like...

568
00:50:09,390 --> 00:50:12,570
I had some friends that was like, watching it on like, obviously at home.

569
00:50:12,670 --> 00:50:13,530
They weren't in Sapporo.

570
00:50:14,050 --> 00:50:20,490
So then, for those who don't know, like, the team that won the finals was the team that nobody recognized.

571
00:50:20,890 --> 00:50:21,710
Like, not nobody.

572
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:22,870
Like, no one was like...

573
00:50:22,870 --> 00:50:25,210
No one knew it was gonna win the tournament.

574
00:50:25,390 --> 00:50:26,470
Cause it was match point final.

575
00:50:26,470 --> 00:50:29,830
They literally just need to win first place after hitting 50 points.

576
00:50:29,910 --> 00:50:30,770
That's all they have to do.

577
00:50:31,150 --> 00:50:31,610
So like, anyway.

578
00:50:31,710 --> 00:50:32,810
Thundercat, thank you for the super chat.

579
00:50:32,890 --> 00:50:33,370
Thank you, thank you.

580
00:50:33,430 --> 00:50:34,330
Today is my birthday!

581
00:50:34,650 --> 00:50:35,390

582
00:50:35,390 --> 00:50:35,890
Of course!

583
00:50:36,030 --> 00:50:37,210
You can get a birthday wish from me.

584
00:50:37,430 --> 00:50:39,570

Happy birthday to you.

589
00:50:47,390 --> 00:50:47,610
Yeah!

590
00:50:50,030 --> 00:50:50,450
Anyway...

591
00:50:51,050 --> 00:50:53,930
Anyway, they were sort of like, the underdogs.

592
00:50:54,450 --> 00:50:56,070
So like...

593
00:50:56,070 --> 00:50:59,070
Not gonna lie, when they won...

594
00:50:59,070 --> 00:51:00,170
I was like...

595
00:51:00,170 --> 00:51:00,510
Who?

596
00:51:01,490 --> 00:51:02,830
I'm so sorry!

597
00:51:03,370 --> 00:51:07,090
And then my friend also texted...

598
00:51:07,090 --> 00:51:11,890
My friend who was live watching it at home was like...

599
00:51:11,890 --> 00:51:13,050
Who the fuck just won?

600
00:51:14,170 --> 00:51:15,410
I was just like...

601
00:51:15,410 --> 00:51:18,010
I had my phone and I googled.

602
00:51:18,070 --> 00:51:18,450
I was like...

603
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:19,070
Oh, they're EU.

604
00:51:19,670 --> 00:51:21,710
And then my friend was like...

605
00:51:21,710 --> 00:51:22,550
Oh my god, that makes sense.

606
00:51:26,610 --> 00:51:27,910
I was just like...

607
00:51:27,910 --> 00:51:28,930
I'm sorry!

608
00:51:29,310 --> 00:51:30,470
I legitimately was like...

609
00:51:30,470 --> 00:51:31,690
Who's to go next?

610
00:51:31,990 --> 00:51:34,230
I was like, look at the players.

611
00:51:34,450 --> 00:51:34,970
And I was like...

612
00:51:34,970 --> 00:51:35,590
Oh, it's EU.

613
00:51:35,830 --> 00:51:36,230
Okay, then.

614
00:51:36,550 --> 00:51:37,710
I'm sorry, EU.

615
00:51:38,150 --> 00:51:39,710
I was like...

616
00:51:40,610 --> 00:51:41,050
Legitimately...

617
00:51:41,050 --> 00:51:41,890
I was just like...

618
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:42,990
Yeah, I was just like...

619
00:51:42,990 --> 00:51:43,650
Oh, no wonder.

620
00:51:43,810 --> 00:51:45,370
No wonder I didn't know who they were.

621
00:51:46,610 --> 00:51:47,490
Because like...

622
00:51:47,490 --> 00:51:47,970
EU...

623
00:51:47,970 --> 00:51:48,950
EU is...

624
00:51:48,950 --> 00:51:51,150
There's only two teams that people know from EU.

625
00:51:51,310 --> 00:51:53,830
And I think it's Aurora and Alliance.

626
00:51:53,830 --> 00:51:54,770
So like...

627
00:51:54,770 --> 00:51:56,070
Any other team is like...

628
00:51:56,070 --> 00:51:56,930
People are like...

629
00:51:56,930 --> 00:51:57,150
Who?

630
00:51:59,010 --> 00:51:59,650
Oh, yeah.

631
00:51:59,670 --> 00:52:00,170
I'm happy.

632
00:52:01,510 --> 00:52:02,990
I was like...

633
00:52:03,490 --> 00:52:04,930
World of Falcons.

634
00:52:05,190 --> 00:52:05,570
Die.

635
00:52:06,090 --> 00:52:06,390
Please.

636
00:52:06,490 --> 00:52:07,250
You won too many.

637
00:52:12,110 --> 00:52:13,570
Oh, were there two rats?

638
00:52:13,870 --> 00:52:15,610
Wait, was that two rats?

639
00:52:15,710 --> 00:52:16,770
Okay, one controller.

640
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:17,650
Oh my god.

641
00:52:17,730 --> 00:52:18,890
Okay, I remember them now.

642
00:52:19,250 --> 00:52:21,150
You see, if they had that name...

643
00:52:21,150 --> 00:52:22,370
I would remember them.

644
00:52:22,370 --> 00:52:25,490
I didn't know that was TwoRatsOneController.

645
00:52:25,730 --> 00:52:27,990
Oh, now the memories are flooding back.

646
00:52:28,110 --> 00:52:30,270
See, TwoRatsOneController was memorable.

647
00:52:30,610 --> 00:52:31,570
GoNext is not.

648
00:52:31,630 --> 00:52:33,150
Even though I know it's because...

649
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:36,350
You know, they got into an org and they have to be GoNext now.

650
00:52:36,450 --> 00:52:39,210
But still, TwoRatsOneController was a very good name.

651
00:52:46,770 --> 00:52:48,130
But yeah, so...

652
00:52:48,130 --> 00:52:49,830
I guess that was...

653
00:52:50,330 --> 00:52:51,990
That was my LAN experience.

654
00:52:52,250 --> 00:52:53,090
Like, I just...

655
00:52:53,090 --> 00:52:55,710
It's just dragged on for so long.

656
00:52:55,850 --> 00:52:56,990
That like...

657
00:52:56,990 --> 00:52:58,290
I just...

658
00:52:58,290 --> 00:53:00,490
I couldn't sit for that long.

659
00:53:00,870 --> 00:53:04,690
I think it's just I was watching it alone and stuff.

660
00:53:05,050 --> 00:53:09,110
Mostly, other than my friends texting me.

661
00:53:09,350 --> 00:53:14,250
I didn't get to experience watching this with friends and stuff.

662
00:53:14,290 --> 00:53:18,930
And I think that was the reason why I didn't enjoy LAN as much as I did.

663
00:53:19,210 --> 00:53:21,570
I think if I was watching with friends...

664
00:53:21,570 --> 00:53:24,890
I think it sucked because I had to be incognito mode too.

665
00:53:24,890 --> 00:53:27,510
Because I got a tweet reply.

666
00:53:27,670 --> 00:53:32,430
They're like, I knew that was you when you were with Tempo.

667
00:53:32,550 --> 00:53:35,130
And I was like, I did not meet up with Tempo.

668
00:53:37,530 --> 00:53:39,270
We kept missing each other.

669
00:53:40,950 --> 00:53:42,570
He walked past me.

670
00:53:42,670 --> 00:53:45,230
But he walked past so fast, I couldn't even say hi.

671
00:53:45,650 --> 00:53:47,850
And then I was like, Oh, that was not me.

672
00:53:48,750 --> 00:53:50,730
That was not me.

673
00:53:53,050 --> 00:53:56,710
They're like, Oh my god, I saw you with Tempo, but I felt weird to intrude.

674
00:53:56,810 --> 00:54:00,470
And I was like, Oh man, if you intrude, you would find out that that was definitely not me.

675
00:54:03,910 --> 00:54:06,530
Because I was like, I was not there.

676
00:54:06,770 --> 00:54:08,610
I was not there with Tempo.

677
00:54:15,090 --> 00:54:17,450
So I thought that was really funny.

678
00:54:17,950 --> 00:54:19,930
I felt like if people thought I was with Tempo...

679
00:54:19,930 --> 00:54:22,950
I don't even know who the fuck that random girl was that was with him.

680
00:54:22,950 --> 00:54:28,610
But I'm now thinking that people randomly went up to Tempo and be like, Oh my god, is that Doki Bird?

681
00:54:28,830 --> 00:54:31,810
And then the poor woman is going to be like, Who the fuck is she?

682
00:54:36,610 --> 00:54:41,530
Yeah, so the only times I could meet people was literally outside the arena.

683
00:54:41,790 --> 00:54:47,310
Because I couldn't trust people.

684
00:54:47,310 --> 00:55:00,390
Because every time the pro players or the people I know were outside, were in a public area where there's fans there, it was just pictures being taken and stuff.

685
00:55:00,790 --> 00:55:04,710
And then people coming up to them and being like, Oh my god, we'll sign this.

686
00:55:05,290 --> 00:55:07,090
And I was just like, I'm backing out.

687
00:55:07,290 --> 00:55:09,550
I'm not getting involved here.

688
00:55:12,530 --> 00:55:14,090
Thank you for the super chat.

689
00:55:14,150 --> 00:55:14,890
Thank you, thank you.

690
00:55:14,890 --> 00:55:21,090
It was Negaverse, Doki, and if he had stopped her, her double copy would have stolen his wallet and also his eternal soul.

691
00:55:21,470 --> 00:55:22,770
Thank you for the super chat, Fuzzy.

692
00:55:22,950 --> 00:55:24,450
Thank you, thank you.

693
00:55:27,890 --> 00:55:30,630
Yeah, and I got so anxious too.

694
00:55:30,770 --> 00:55:32,450
I was like, oh, do they know?

695
00:55:34,130 --> 00:55:36,130
I was super fucking anxious.

696
00:55:36,450 --> 00:55:40,330
I was like, oh, they don't know I'm Doki Bird.

697
00:55:40,530 --> 00:55:41,530
Or do they?

698
00:55:43,310 --> 00:55:46,990
That's how I felt during the time in the arena.

699
00:55:47,190 --> 00:55:48,410
I was like, they don't know.

700
00:55:48,950 --> 00:55:49,730
Or do they?

701
00:55:50,050 --> 00:55:51,370
Or do they know?

702
00:56:00,470 --> 00:56:01,530
Oh my god, okay.

703
00:56:01,570 --> 00:56:02,610
And then there were so many lines.

704
00:56:02,710 --> 00:56:05,670
Okay, I had to wait for lines for a cab.

705
00:56:06,190 --> 00:56:06,990
And then I had to wait.

706
00:56:07,210 --> 00:56:08,790
Oh my god, there were so many lines.

707
00:56:08,930 --> 00:56:10,530
Oh my god, I can't fucking...

708
00:56:12,570 --> 00:56:16,390
There's a reason why I kept leaving before the game's end.

709
00:56:16,570 --> 00:56:21,570
And then like, the champs was the one time I stayed the entire time.

710
00:56:21,730 --> 00:56:24,270
But there were so many people that needed to take the cab.

711
00:56:24,850 --> 00:56:26,690
I felt like I was...

712
00:56:26,690 --> 00:56:30,350
I waited for a cab for like an hour and a half.

713
00:56:30,610 --> 00:56:35,450
Like almost an hour and a half waiting for a cab to go eat dinner.

714
00:56:35,930 --> 00:56:39,310
Because I was like, you know, I could have just taken...

715
00:56:39,310 --> 00:56:40,410
I should have just taken the subway.

716
00:56:41,530 --> 00:56:45,310
I should have just taken the subway.

717
00:56:45,910 --> 00:56:47,350
I'm so stupid.

718
00:56:47,790 --> 00:56:49,750
I was just like, I'm already in too deep.

719
00:56:50,010 --> 00:56:56,090
I was like, when I got to like 30 minutes, I was just like, I'm already lining up.

720
00:56:56,190 --> 00:57:00,530
I might as well stay for the rest of the line.

721
00:57:00,810 --> 00:57:03,730
And then, you know, it hit 40 to 50 minutes.

722
00:57:03,890 --> 00:57:08,390
I was like, oh, I'm already in too deep.

723
00:57:09,290 --> 00:57:12,750
I'm already in too deep.

724
00:57:17,970 --> 00:57:19,710
So, yeah.

725
00:57:19,950 --> 00:57:20,130
Okay.

726
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:22,770
Also, I wrote some notes down during this trip.

727
00:57:22,870 --> 00:57:26,170
Because like, you know, I like to write notes down when I'm traveling just for stories and stuff.

728
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:34,110
But the games were so long during champs finals that some guys in front of me were fucking playing gacha games.

729
00:57:34,110 --> 00:57:44,130
And I was just like, I'm looking in front of me and some guys on their phones were like literally pulling for gacha.

730
00:57:44,350 --> 00:57:45,830
Or like doing their rolls and stuff.

731
00:57:45,930 --> 00:57:47,850
And I was just like, dailies and stuff.

732
00:57:47,950 --> 00:57:48,910
And I was like, you know what?

733
00:57:50,850 --> 00:57:51,330
Understandable.

734
00:57:51,570 --> 00:57:52,450
Like, valid.

735
00:57:52,950 --> 00:57:57,130
Like, because it was like, we were at game fucking eight.

736
00:57:57,210 --> 00:57:59,950
Okay, like, I was like, that's valid.

737
00:58:05,270 --> 00:58:07,510
That's fucking valid, buddy.

738
00:58:07,610 --> 00:58:09,030
That's so valid.

739
00:58:10,190 --> 00:58:12,330
Gotta do the dailies.

740
00:58:12,910 --> 00:58:13,070
Yeah.

741
00:58:14,070 --> 00:58:15,410
Like, oh my god.

742
00:58:15,630 --> 00:58:19,330
Just to watch nine games for teams to not win.

743
00:58:19,450 --> 00:58:20,530
Like, I'm tired.

744
00:58:20,870 --> 00:58:21,470
It's loud.

745
00:58:21,890 --> 00:58:22,930
I had a headache too.

746
00:58:23,190 --> 00:58:27,490
I had to put on like my earphones at one point.

747
00:58:27,690 --> 00:58:29,370
Like during half of the games.

748
00:58:29,710 --> 00:58:31,270
Because it was so loud.

749
00:58:31,810 --> 00:58:33,410
And like, I took videos by the way.

750
00:58:33,410 --> 00:58:34,650
The stadium was packed.

751
00:58:34,850 --> 00:58:35,970
Like, this is the background of my photo.

752
00:58:36,130 --> 00:58:38,450
That's basically like, it was sold out.

753
00:58:38,530 --> 00:58:40,770
Like 20,000 people apparently in the stadium.

754
00:58:41,290 --> 00:58:43,560
And like, I had to put like earphones in.

755
00:58:44,330 --> 00:58:46,430
So like, just to dampen the sound.

756
00:58:46,530 --> 00:58:47,410
Because it was so loud.

757
00:58:47,550 --> 00:58:48,450
Because I got a headache.

758
00:58:49,090 --> 00:58:50,210
Or was it 30k?

759
00:58:50,270 --> 00:58:51,290
Oh my god, that's even more.

760
00:58:51,370 --> 00:58:52,470
I thought it was 20k.

761
00:58:53,170 --> 00:58:53,930
Spreading misinformation.

762
00:58:54,630 --> 00:58:55,530
What else is new?

763
00:58:55,990 --> 00:58:58,550
But I don't know how many people the stadium allows.

764
00:58:58,830 --> 00:59:01,090
But it was around, it was like 20 to 30k.

765
00:59:01,170 --> 00:59:02,350
It was sold out by the way.

766
00:59:02,350 --> 00:59:03,610
Well, not for me.

767
00:59:03,690 --> 00:59:06,230
Because I had the special guest pass.

768
00:59:07,190 --> 00:59:08,210
I could go.

769
00:59:08,590 --> 00:59:10,750
So like, by the way.

770
00:59:11,110 --> 00:59:12,690
I forgot to bring my guest pass.

771
00:59:13,150 --> 00:59:16,150
And then I like, because there's like a special line to go in.

772
00:59:16,330 --> 00:59:18,670
For like people with like the special passes.

773
00:59:19,510 --> 00:59:21,470
And then I was like, I forgot to bring my pass.

774
00:59:21,570 --> 00:59:22,310
Can I have another one?

775
00:59:22,350 --> 00:59:23,130
But I'm on the list.

776
00:59:23,570 --> 00:59:24,450
I'm on the list.

777
00:59:24,510 --> 00:59:25,050
I'm somebody.

778
00:59:25,050 --> 00:59:32,830
And then they're like, yeah, of course.

779
00:59:32,890 --> 00:59:34,650
But you gotta return it the next day.

780
00:59:34,870 --> 00:59:36,210
I didn't return it.

781
00:59:45,070 --> 00:59:47,030
So now I have two passes.

782
00:59:51,490 --> 00:59:53,770
It has my name on it!

783
00:59:53,770 --> 00:59:56,010
It has my name on it!

784
00:59:56,070 --> 00:59:56,930
It doesn't matter.

785
00:59:57,270 --> 00:59:59,010
They can't reuse it.

786
00:59:59,490 --> 01:00:03,370
They can't reuse it.

787
01:00:03,410 --> 01:00:04,790
It has my name on it.

788
01:00:04,870 --> 01:00:05,850
What are they gonna do?

789
01:00:05,990 --> 01:00:07,750
It was just gonna be garbage anyway.

790
01:00:11,330 --> 01:00:12,530
You rebel.

791
01:00:14,270 --> 01:00:14,870
Yay!

792
01:00:18,230 --> 01:00:20,130
Now I have two passes.

793
01:00:24,030 --> 01:00:25,310
I didn't do it intentionally.

794
01:00:25,430 --> 01:00:26,730
I just forgot to return it.

795
01:00:26,890 --> 01:00:27,970
Okay, guys.

796
01:00:28,110 --> 01:00:30,710
I legitimately did not do it intentionally.

797
01:00:30,930 --> 01:00:31,910
I just forgot.

798
01:00:32,110 --> 01:00:33,570
And I was like, well, it's the last day.

799
01:00:33,710 --> 01:00:35,430
I can't bring it back now.

800
01:00:39,290 --> 01:00:41,270
I was just like, what am I gonna do?

801
01:00:41,390 --> 01:00:42,310
Bring it back?

802
01:00:42,390 --> 01:00:43,830
It's the last day.

803
01:00:44,390 --> 01:00:44,810
I can't.

804
01:00:45,110 --> 01:00:46,570
There's no tomorrow.

805
01:00:50,710 --> 01:00:52,170
I just forgot.

806
01:00:52,910 --> 01:00:53,790
It's different.

807
01:00:58,230 --> 01:01:01,030
There was another thing that was super unlucky.

808
01:01:05,890 --> 01:01:07,350
I'm reading back the notes.

809
01:01:07,470 --> 01:01:08,570
I wrote a lot of notes.

810
01:01:10,790 --> 01:01:13,250
I wrote a lot of notes.

811
01:01:15,250 --> 01:01:16,310
I don't know if you guys know.

812
01:01:17,130 --> 01:01:19,850
I was gonna tell this when I'm back, but I'll tell you guys this now.

813
01:01:23,430 --> 01:01:29,790
The Tokyo airport has to be the most fucking confusing shit ever.

814
01:01:30,990 --> 01:01:36,450
If you have a transfer flight, it is so...

815
01:01:36,450 --> 01:01:45,170
If you guys didn't know this, usually you would think that they would...

816
01:01:47,970 --> 01:01:51,370
People instantly knew which airport it was.

817
01:01:52,690 --> 01:01:54,050
They're like, this one?

818
01:01:54,310 --> 01:01:54,570
Yeah.

819
01:02:01,070 --> 01:02:07,030
So basically, if you guys didn't know, when you transfer, usually your luggage goes to the next plane, right?

820
01:02:08,250 --> 01:02:12,470
Yeah, usually that should be it.

821
01:02:12,650 --> 01:02:15,690
Your luggage would just... you don't have to do anything about it.

822
01:02:15,970 --> 01:02:17,730
That's usually how it goes.

823
01:02:17,730 --> 01:02:21,770
But when you land in Japan, you have to pick up your luggage.

824
01:02:22,130 --> 01:02:25,350
And then you gotta go to a different fucking terminal.

825
01:02:25,930 --> 01:02:28,070
And then you gotta check in.

826
01:02:28,470 --> 01:02:30,770
You gotta check in that luggage again.

827
01:02:34,930 --> 01:02:39,770
So the issue was that I was like, where the fuck am I?

828
01:02:43,470 --> 01:02:45,210
Oh my god.

829
01:02:47,730 --> 01:02:48,930
Yeah, so like...

830
01:02:49,810 --> 01:02:51,870
So you have to go through...

831
01:02:51,870 --> 01:02:55,930
You have to basically grab your luggage and fucking...

832
01:02:55,930 --> 01:02:56,630
Oh my god.

833
01:02:57,430 --> 01:03:04,010
No, but they transfer your luggage to a different... usually transfer it to a different plane.

834
01:03:04,390 --> 01:03:04,630
Anyway.

835
01:03:06,210 --> 01:03:09,410
Anyway, so like, I went there.

836
01:03:09,770 --> 01:03:13,250
And then I had to transfer it to...

837
01:03:13,250 --> 01:03:14,430
I was so fucking...

838
01:03:14,430 --> 01:03:15,430
The thing is...

839
01:03:17,250 --> 01:03:23,950
I had such a short window to do all of that, that I had to be booked at the next flight.

840
01:03:24,390 --> 01:03:27,270
Because when we arrived, we had a small delay on my flight.

841
01:03:27,710 --> 01:03:31,830
So when I arrived, they were like, you're gonna miss this flight, I'm sorry.

842
01:03:32,130 --> 01:03:33,370
I was just like, whoa.

843
01:03:35,430 --> 01:03:39,530
The amount of time I had to get my fucking luggage.

844
01:03:40,110 --> 01:03:40,430
And then...

845
01:03:41,430 --> 01:03:42,990
And take it to a different flight.

846
01:03:42,990 --> 01:03:44,410
I was not gonna make it.

847
01:03:44,570 --> 01:03:47,850
So I didn't have to pay for the new hour.

848
01:03:48,010 --> 01:03:49,710
I was like, thank god it was just an hour later.

849
01:03:50,030 --> 01:03:51,630
Because I was like, I was gonna go crazy.

850
01:03:52,730 --> 01:03:56,650
I was gonna go fucking crazy if it got delayed.

851
01:03:57,130 --> 01:03:58,310
Because I was so tired.

852
01:03:58,850 --> 01:04:02,590
But basically, they were like, yeah, it's okay.

853
01:04:02,710 --> 01:04:03,790
The next flight is an hour.

854
01:04:04,370 --> 01:04:04,990
And then...

855
01:04:08,990 --> 01:04:11,230
But then I was like, where the fuck am I?

856
01:04:13,230 --> 01:04:15,730
They don't write this down for you, by the way.

857
01:04:15,750 --> 01:04:17,130
They don't give you a sheet that has all the information.

858
01:04:17,650 --> 01:04:20,050
It was basically like, they just tell you and then you just gotta remember.

859
01:04:20,390 --> 01:04:23,250
So they were like, you gotta go to Terminal 2.

860
01:04:23,910 --> 01:04:25,610
I was in Terminal 3, by the way.

861
01:04:26,830 --> 01:04:28,850
Because I was like, what terminal am I in?

862
01:04:29,250 --> 01:04:31,890
When I got out, I was just like, where am I?

863
01:04:32,570 --> 01:04:34,430
What terminal am I in?

864
01:04:34,870 --> 01:04:35,990
Where do I go?

865
01:04:37,170 --> 01:04:39,090
And I had to take a bus.

866
01:04:39,310 --> 01:04:40,390
I was like, where's the bus?

867
01:04:40,390 --> 01:04:44,370
And then like, you gotta get out of the terminal and get to a bus.

868
01:04:44,570 --> 01:04:46,550
And then like, where's the bus?

869
01:04:46,830 --> 01:04:47,730
Where is it?

870
01:04:47,830 --> 01:04:49,030
And you get to the bus.

871
01:04:49,370 --> 01:04:52,410
And you gotta wait two stops because it goes to Terminal 1 first.

872
01:04:52,450 --> 01:04:53,650
And then Terminal 2.

873
01:04:53,910 --> 01:04:59,830
And then you gotta find the airline where your next flight is.

874
01:04:59,930 --> 01:05:02,190
And then I was just like, where the fuck am I?

875
01:05:02,730 --> 01:05:03,470
Holy shit.

876
01:05:03,810 --> 01:05:05,910
And also, everything closes so early.

877
01:05:06,010 --> 01:05:08,230
This airport is already closed.

878
01:05:12,370 --> 01:05:14,570
And then, obviously...

879
01:05:14,570 --> 01:05:17,390
And then like, oh my god, I didn't realize how fucking...

880
01:05:19,070 --> 01:05:24,390
And then, one of my biggest gripes is that like...

881
01:05:26,210 --> 01:05:31,570
I love Japan because they're all like, you know, technology and like, they're super...

882
01:05:31,570 --> 01:05:32,530
What's it called?

883
01:05:33,710 --> 01:05:42,470
They're very like, orderly and like, bureaucracy and stuff like that.

884
01:05:42,630 --> 01:05:44,010
And like, they're very to the point.

885
01:05:44,530 --> 01:05:46,330
And oh my god, what's the word I'm looking for?

886
01:05:46,690 --> 01:05:47,110
Efficient.

887
01:05:47,590 --> 01:05:52,090
But sometimes, they're so efficient that it's inefficient.

888
01:05:52,670 --> 01:05:56,530
And I will tell you one of the things that made me so...

889
01:05:56,530 --> 01:05:58,870
Like, I was gonna freak out because I was tired.

890
01:05:58,870 --> 01:06:01,510
So like, I forgot...

891
01:06:01,510 --> 01:06:03,370
The one thing I forgot was...

892
01:06:03,370 --> 01:06:07,510
The one thing I forgot was that I forgot to bring coins.

893
01:06:07,870 --> 01:06:09,590
I forgot to get currency.

894
01:06:09,990 --> 01:06:11,370
Because like, I was like, I'm just...

895
01:06:11,370 --> 01:06:11,970
I don't know why.

896
01:06:12,250 --> 01:06:13,390
I don't know why.

897
01:06:13,470 --> 01:06:16,730
I felt like I was like, prepared but also not prepared at the same time.

898
01:06:16,950 --> 01:06:17,990
So I forgot to bring currency.

899
01:06:18,390 --> 01:06:19,490
So I was really thirsty.

900
01:06:19,970 --> 01:06:21,870
So I was like, there's a vending machine, right?

901
01:06:22,250 --> 01:06:25,410
And then I was like, oh man, I don't have cash on me.

902
01:06:25,470 --> 01:06:28,210
But I do have Apple Pay and my card.

903
01:06:28,210 --> 01:06:34,590
So like, I thought, you know, like normally, you just beep the card.

904
01:06:34,770 --> 01:06:36,450
And then you get your drink.

905
01:06:36,810 --> 01:06:39,210
But then like, I was so confused.

906
01:06:39,210 --> 01:06:41,210
Because I was like, why isn't this working?

907
01:06:41,470 --> 01:06:43,310
It clearly has a card reader.

908
01:06:43,690 --> 01:06:45,730
And I was like, beep, beep.

909
01:06:46,010 --> 01:06:48,090
So like, I was like, that's so weird.

910
01:06:48,370 --> 01:06:49,430
And I tried my Apple Pay.

911
01:06:49,510 --> 01:06:51,230
I was like, maybe it's my card not working.

912
01:06:51,570 --> 01:06:52,630
And I was like, I was thirsty.

913
01:06:52,670 --> 01:06:53,490
I was thirsty as hell.

914
01:06:53,770 --> 01:06:55,070
I was like, beep, beep.

915
01:06:55,130 --> 01:06:55,950
Okay, not working.

916
01:06:55,950 --> 01:06:58,350
And the lady next to me was doing the same thing.

917
01:06:58,550 --> 01:07:01,590
So then I was like, oh my god, what am I doing wrong?

918
01:07:02,050 --> 01:07:09,170
Apparently, so on the card reader, there were symbols on the top.

919
01:07:09,630 --> 01:07:15,230
There were symbols of what kind of card you're supposed to, you can use.

920
01:07:15,510 --> 01:07:22,390
And you're supposed to press the symbol of the card that you're using.

921
01:07:22,590 --> 01:07:25,070
But it was not clear.

922
01:07:25,070 --> 01:07:25,870
I...

923
01:07:29,990 --> 01:07:33,550
Because it was, they all glow.

924
01:07:34,450 --> 01:07:47,740
I didn't realize you have to select the exact card you're using.

925
01:07:48,610 --> 01:07:51,870
But like, everything glowed.

926
01:07:51,930 --> 01:07:55,690
So I didn't realize that like, there was no instructions.

927
01:07:55,690 --> 01:07:56,890
There was no instructions.

928
01:07:57,150 --> 01:08:01,850
Like, even if there was, I would have fucking got my Google Translate and translated that.

929
01:08:03,150 --> 01:08:03,590
Like...

930
01:08:03,590 --> 01:08:12,130
And so, I was just like, I was just like, I can't.

931
01:08:12,350 --> 01:08:17,950
I was like, I figured, because I was like, oh my gosh, like, I was just like, am I stupid?

932
01:08:19,830 --> 01:08:20,270
Like...

933
01:08:20,270 --> 01:08:23,270
I was like, but the lady beside me was also so fucking confused.

934
01:08:23,610 --> 01:08:24,830
She didn't understand too.

935
01:08:24,830 --> 01:08:25,370
Like...

936
01:08:29,570 --> 01:08:36,450
And so, yeah, and so then I was just like, I was just like, because like, I was desperate.

937
01:08:36,550 --> 01:08:37,350
I was like, okay, whatever.

938
01:08:37,650 --> 01:08:39,430
I was like, oh my gosh, this is my last ditch effort.

939
01:08:39,610 --> 01:08:41,990
Like, am I supposed to press these symbols?

940
01:08:42,510 --> 01:08:44,470
Like, because it doesn't look like you could press them.

941
01:08:44,710 --> 01:08:45,550
That was the thing.

942
01:08:45,710 --> 01:08:47,810
It didn't look like I could press them.

943
01:08:47,950 --> 01:08:52,550
So I was just like, oh my God, like, but I was just like, maybe I can press them.

944
01:08:52,830 --> 01:08:53,790
I was like...

945
01:08:53,790 --> 01:08:54,890
I was like...

946
01:08:54,890 --> 01:08:56,130
I was like...

947
01:08:56,130 --> 01:09:00,890
I was like, oh my God, maybe, like, you can actually press this.

948
01:09:01,070 --> 01:09:04,550
And I pressed it, and then it, like, you know, it, like, sparkled.

949
01:09:04,770 --> 01:09:05,030
Like...

950
01:09:05,590 --> 01:09:08,350
It, like, you know, glowed in and out.

951
01:09:08,530 --> 01:09:10,390
I was like, oh my fucking God.

952
01:09:12,470 --> 01:09:15,050
I had to deal with puzzles in real life.

953
01:09:15,350 --> 01:09:17,690
I was like, oh my God.

954
01:09:18,330 --> 01:09:20,610
Oh my God, I can actually get water.

955
01:09:24,890 --> 01:09:26,510
Oh my God.

956
01:09:26,630 --> 01:09:31,110
And then it blew my mind.

957
01:09:31,550 --> 01:09:33,130
I was like, that's so dumb.

958
01:09:33,290 --> 01:09:35,330
I was like, that's so dumb.

959
01:09:35,770 --> 01:09:37,870
Holy shit, why wasn't this automatic?

960
01:09:38,050 --> 01:09:40,450
Why did I have to personally select the symbol?

961
01:09:40,610 --> 01:09:42,110
I was so confused.

962
01:09:42,810 --> 01:09:44,930
I was so...

963
01:09:44,930 --> 01:09:47,150
Oh my God, where is my yellow paint?

964
01:09:47,310 --> 01:09:47,490
Yeah.

965
01:09:48,730 --> 01:09:50,130
Oh my God.

966
01:09:50,130 --> 01:09:54,630
Anyway, so that was, like, that was my sad moment.

967
01:09:54,890 --> 01:09:56,190
That, like, I was...

968
01:09:56,190 --> 01:10:01,510
That was my fucking sad moment there.

969
01:10:04,810 --> 01:10:06,130
Oh my God.

970
01:10:06,470 --> 01:10:08,950
Anyway, so, there was that.

971
01:10:09,150 --> 01:10:10,130
And then...

972
01:10:11,630 --> 01:10:13,350
Yeah, it didn't give me any hints.

973
01:10:13,410 --> 01:10:15,170
It was just like, you just gotta deal with it.

974
01:10:15,190 --> 01:10:16,870
You gotta figure this out yourself, Doki.

975
01:10:22,010 --> 01:10:25,070
Oh my God, Professor Lin actually trained me for this.

976
01:10:27,530 --> 01:10:28,410
Anyway, so...

977
01:10:28,410 --> 01:10:29,930
Okay, so people were like, food poisoning.

978
01:10:30,110 --> 01:10:31,570
There really isn't much of a story.

979
01:10:32,170 --> 01:10:35,430
I don't know what the fuck I ate in Japan.

980
01:10:36,090 --> 01:10:36,910
I legitimately don't know.

981
01:10:37,050 --> 01:10:38,730
Like, I cannot figure this out.

982
01:10:39,830 --> 01:10:40,990
Like, it could have been anything.

983
01:10:41,230 --> 01:10:41,830
It really could.

984
01:10:42,050 --> 01:10:47,410
Like, out of all the places I had to get food poisoning, it was Japan, which is crazy to think about.

985
01:10:48,070 --> 01:10:49,930
Because, like, I don't know how.

986
01:10:50,310 --> 01:10:52,150
Literally, just like, I ate food.

987
01:10:52,350 --> 01:10:53,010
I ate lunch.

988
01:10:53,490 --> 01:10:56,750
I, like, lunch, and dessert, and dinner.

989
01:10:57,190 --> 01:10:59,450
And then, went to bed at 7.

990
01:10:59,730 --> 01:11:02,330
I woke up, and I was not alive anymore.

991
01:11:02,570 --> 01:11:04,930
I was not a person anymore.

992
01:11:05,350 --> 01:11:08,850
I was just, I used the bathroom, and I was like, my stomach was not feeling good.

993
01:11:08,910 --> 01:11:09,570
And I was like, oh.

994
01:11:09,990 --> 01:11:11,350
And then, I was like, used the bathroom.

995
01:11:11,470 --> 01:11:12,350
I was like, oh my gosh.

996
01:11:12,430 --> 01:11:14,070
Okay, I'm definitely, I ate something wrong.

997
01:11:14,450 --> 01:11:17,130
And then, my stomach was still like, ooh, it doesn't feel so good.

998
01:11:17,390 --> 01:11:18,770
So then, I went back to the bathroom.

999
01:11:18,770 --> 01:11:21,470
And then, I was like, am I gonna throw up?

1000
01:11:22,730 --> 01:11:23,370
I did.

1001
01:11:25,730 --> 01:11:26,990
I looked at the toilet.

1002
01:11:27,210 --> 01:11:28,590
I was like, am I gonna throw up?

1003
01:11:29,110 --> 01:11:29,950
And then, it happened.

1004
01:11:30,170 --> 01:11:30,830
And I was like, oh.

1005
01:11:42,910 --> 01:11:48,510
And then, yeah, and then like, because I was like, okay, I could feel something in my stomach.

1006
01:11:48,630 --> 01:11:52,250
And it wants to come out of my mouth hole, not the other hole.

1007
01:11:56,330 --> 01:12:00,410
And then, I was just like, okay.

1008
01:12:00,410 --> 01:12:03,310
I definitely ate something wrong.

1009
01:12:04,390 --> 01:12:05,270
I definitely.

1010
01:12:07,690 --> 01:12:17,630
And then, so like, and then, so I was basically, I was living in the bathroom and also the bed for like, until like, for 24 hours.

1011
01:12:18,290 --> 01:12:21,230
And then, like, I couldn't keep water down.

1012
01:12:21,390 --> 01:12:22,870
I legitimately, like, I would drink water.

1013
01:12:23,350 --> 01:12:25,210
And like, I was throwing up water too.

1014
01:12:25,330 --> 01:12:26,470
So, it was bad.

1015
01:12:26,690 --> 01:12:28,810
I don't know how the fuck I survived.

1016
01:12:28,810 --> 01:12:30,650
And I told, like, some of my friends about it.

1017
01:12:31,070 --> 01:12:37,810
Like, you know, after the, like, today, I was just like, yeah, I got food poisoning.

1018
01:12:38,110 --> 01:12:41,170
And then, they were like, oh, man, you should, like, be careful what you're eating.

1019
01:12:41,370 --> 01:12:43,470
Like, because, you know, like, you might feel okay.

1020
01:12:43,710 --> 01:12:47,190
And then, like, but, like, for dinner, because I didn't eat lunch at all.

1021
01:12:47,230 --> 01:12:51,970
I didn't even eat lunch because, like, when I woke up, like, today, I didn't even eat lunch.

1022
01:12:52,030 --> 01:12:52,590
I ate nothing.

1023
01:12:52,810 --> 01:12:54,770
Like, I think my, I wasn't even hungry though.

1024
01:12:54,770 --> 01:12:58,790
Like, um, I wasn't even hungry at all.

1025
01:12:58,830 --> 01:12:59,990
No, I couldn't hold water down.

1026
01:13:00,070 --> 01:13:00,830
It was actually water.

1027
01:13:00,870 --> 01:13:02,610
Because I would drink water and I would throw up water.

1028
01:13:03,110 --> 01:13:05,970
Um, so, like, I literally could just quit and keep eating.

1029
01:13:06,190 --> 01:13:07,570
Like, I would drink Pocari Sweat.

1030
01:13:07,830 --> 01:13:10,630
Because, like, I was reading that you should get electrolytes too.

1031
01:13:11,030 --> 01:13:14,410
And then, like, I couldn't even keep, like, Pocari Sweat in.

1032
01:13:14,590 --> 01:13:16,750
Because I was throwing up the Pocari Sweat too.

1033
01:13:16,770 --> 01:13:18,290
I could tell I was throwing up the Pocari Sweat.

1034
01:13:18,470 --> 01:13:19,810
Oh, that's disgusting.

1035
01:13:19,990 --> 01:13:20,710
I'm sorry.

1036
01:13:21,270 --> 01:13:21,630
TMI.

1037
01:13:22,190 --> 01:13:24,130
But, like, I had to give you that information.

1038
01:13:24,130 --> 01:13:27,750
Like, it was not okay.

1039
01:13:28,310 --> 01:13:29,190
Like, ew.

1040
01:13:29,430 --> 01:13:30,550
It was not okay.

1041
01:13:31,170 --> 01:13:36,270
And then, so, like, um, so, um, anyway.

1042
01:13:37,490 --> 01:13:38,670
Uh, not TMI.

1043
01:13:38,910 --> 01:13:39,930
Thank you for sharing.

1044
01:13:40,610 --> 01:13:42,730
And, um, anyway.

1045
01:13:44,030 --> 01:13:50,050
Um, so, like, um, so, like, my friends, they're, like, telling me, like, oh, yeah.

1046
01:13:50,090 --> 01:13:51,510
It's the day after your food poisoning.

1047
01:13:51,550 --> 01:13:52,890
Because I was like, I feel great now.

1048
01:13:52,890 --> 01:13:55,070
I think I got it out of my system.

1049
01:13:55,510 --> 01:13:57,170
And my friends, they were, like, telling me.

1050
01:13:57,230 --> 01:13:58,710
Because I was like, I'm gonna grab dinner.

1051
01:13:59,410 --> 01:14:01,270
And they're like, oh, you should be careful.

1052
01:14:01,350 --> 01:14:02,410
You should eat something light.

1053
01:14:02,490 --> 01:14:03,530
You should maybe get soup.

1054
01:14:03,590 --> 01:14:04,610
Maybe miso soup.

1055
01:14:04,910 --> 01:14:06,670
And I was like, I don't care.

1056
01:14:06,810 --> 01:14:08,230
I'm gonna eat something good.

1057
01:14:12,270 --> 01:14:14,010
I was like, no.

1058
01:14:14,710 --> 01:14:17,070
I'm fucking going at it.

1059
01:14:20,250 --> 01:14:22,110
Anyway, I had a great dinner.

1060
01:14:23,330 --> 01:14:24,850
I got pasta.

1061
01:14:25,970 --> 01:14:26,950
No, I'm okay.

1062
01:14:29,690 --> 01:14:31,150
Surprisingly, I'm invincible.

1063
01:14:33,730 --> 01:14:35,850
Surprisingly, I'm okay for now.

1064
01:14:36,250 --> 01:14:36,770
I don't know.

1065
01:14:36,930 --> 01:14:37,450
Maybe later.

1066
01:14:38,410 --> 01:14:39,210
Goodbye, pasta.

1067
01:14:39,410 --> 01:14:40,070
Maybe later.

1068
01:14:40,650 --> 01:14:47,510
But, like, they're, like, just, like, you should really, like, make sure you eat slow.

1069
01:14:48,010 --> 01:14:49,850
And make sure, like, maybe don't eat something too much.

1070
01:14:49,950 --> 01:14:51,310
Like, you know, eat something light.

1071
01:14:51,310 --> 01:14:53,150
And, like, maybe get some soup.

1072
01:14:53,290 --> 01:14:54,250
And I was like, no.

1073
01:14:54,730 --> 01:14:56,450
I'm gonna eat something good.

1074
01:14:57,230 --> 01:14:59,270
I haven't eaten anything in so long.

1075
01:15:02,770 --> 01:15:04,030
Swarm, thank you for the super chat.

1076
01:15:04,110 --> 01:15:04,890
Thank you, thank you.

1077
01:15:04,970 --> 01:15:06,730
When you feel under the weather, drink bran.

1078
01:15:06,830 --> 01:15:07,340
It got electrolytes.

1079
01:15:07,950 --> 01:15:09,190
It's what plants crave.

1080
01:15:09,410 --> 01:15:10,350
Thank you for the super chat.

1081
01:15:10,430 --> 01:15:11,450
Thank you, thank you.

1082
01:15:12,550 --> 01:15:14,170
Anyway, I had pasta.

1083
01:15:15,270 --> 01:15:16,710
Carbonara pasta, too.

1084
01:15:17,610 --> 01:15:18,370
In Japan.

1085
01:15:18,530 --> 01:15:20,810
I really, I love, like, Japanese pasta.

1086
01:15:20,810 --> 01:15:25,810
It's, like, there's, like, a way they make pasta that's, like, I don't know.

1087
01:15:25,850 --> 01:15:26,470
It's just different.

1088
01:15:26,690 --> 01:15:31,890
Like, Japanese pasta, the way they make it is different from, like, the way...

1089
01:15:31,890 --> 01:15:34,990
It's different from, like, you know, N.A.

1090
01:15:35,050 --> 01:15:35,390
pasta.

1091
01:15:35,530 --> 01:15:36,950
So, I was, like, I was looking forward to it.

1092
01:15:37,070 --> 01:15:37,590
And, anyway.

1093
01:15:38,210 --> 01:15:39,790
Yeah, I live on the edge.

1094
01:15:39,850 --> 01:15:43,330
I might have just had food poisoning literally 24 hours ago.

1095
01:15:43,550 --> 01:15:45,770
But I got this.

1096
01:15:47,370 --> 01:15:48,930
You only live one.

1097
01:15:51,670 --> 01:15:53,010
It was the one.

1098
01:15:53,210 --> 01:15:54,010
That was why.

1099
01:15:54,150 --> 01:15:55,490
I don't know why the fuck I did that.

1100
01:15:57,750 --> 01:15:59,090
Bless your heart.

1101
01:15:59,430 --> 01:16:00,470
Really, I'm proud.

1102
01:16:00,930 --> 01:16:01,930
Thank you for the super chat.

1103
01:16:02,050 --> 01:16:03,150
Thank you, thank you.

1104
01:16:03,370 --> 01:16:06,930
I have no idea why the fuck I risked my life for that pasta.

1105
01:16:08,610 --> 01:16:10,170
I could have got curry, too.

1106
01:16:10,330 --> 01:16:12,130
I was thinking, I was like, wow, do I get curry?

1107
01:16:12,270 --> 01:16:13,410
But then the line was too long.

1108
01:16:13,450 --> 01:16:15,310
So, I was like, pasta it is.

1109
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:19,840
Alright, guys.

1110
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:21,520
I did say today was gonna be a short stream.

1111
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:22,600
I'm sorry, guys.

1112
01:16:22,680 --> 01:16:23,380
I gotta...

1113
01:16:23,740 --> 01:16:25,060
I'm gonna call it here.

1114
01:16:25,260 --> 01:16:25,680
Oh, my God.

1115
01:16:25,780 --> 01:16:27,140
I've been yapping for an hour.

1116
01:16:27,300 --> 01:16:28,200
I missed you guys.

1117
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:29,620
I missed you guys, Dragoons.

1118
01:16:29,680 --> 01:16:30,520
It's been a while.

1119
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:31,620
And, like...

1120
01:16:31,620 --> 01:16:32,560
Oh, my gosh.

1121
01:16:32,700 --> 01:16:33,000
Oh, yeah.

1122
01:16:33,060 --> 01:16:34,320
By the way, here's a little tidbit.

1123
01:16:34,720 --> 01:16:36,440
There was an after party for...

1124
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:37,720
I don't know if I'm supposed...

1125
01:16:37,720 --> 01:16:39,400
I feel like the players would talk about it.

1126
01:16:39,640 --> 01:16:42,000
There's an after party for, like, LGS.

1127
01:16:42,300 --> 01:16:45,800
For, like, players and, like, coaches and staff.

1128
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:48,080
They're allowed to bring a plus one.

1129
01:16:48,260 --> 01:16:49,740
And then I was like, nah.

1130
01:16:49,740 --> 01:16:51,560
Because I wanted to...

1131
01:16:51,560 --> 01:16:52,300
I wanted to sleep.

1132
01:16:54,220 --> 01:16:55,180
But, like...

1133
01:16:55,180 --> 01:16:56,500
Also, like, I got paranoid.

1134
01:16:56,500 --> 01:16:58,960
Because I knew people were gonna take pictures in the after party.

1135
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:00,120
And then...

1136
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:01,460
But the thing is...

1137
01:17:01,460 --> 01:17:04,360
The after party was in a red light district.

1138
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:05,620
And I was like, whoa!

1139
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:11,060
Oh, my God.

1140
01:17:11,420 --> 01:17:12,240
Oh, my God.

1141
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:15,140
I found out they fucking hosted...

1142
01:17:15,140 --> 01:17:18,100
They're hosting it at a red light district.

1143
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:21,420
I was like...

1144
01:17:23,480 --> 01:17:25,370
I was like, holy fuck!

1145
01:17:26,500 --> 01:17:29,480
Wow, some of those players are getting some action today!

1146
01:17:32,660 --> 01:17:34,380
Oh, my God.

1147
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:39,220
I was like, that's fucking crazy!

1148
01:17:40,020 --> 01:17:41,880
I was like, oh, my God!

1149
01:17:42,360 --> 01:17:44,700
Because one of my friends texted me.

1150
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:46,440
They're like, I'm fucking leaving.

1151
01:17:47,700 --> 01:17:50,200
They're like, this is a red light district.

1152
01:17:50,420 --> 01:17:50,820
Oh, my God.

1153
01:17:50,860 --> 01:17:51,660
I'm so...

1154
01:17:51,660 --> 01:17:53,380
Because they're like an introvert.

1155
01:17:53,500 --> 01:17:56,280
One of my friends who's a player is an introvert.

1156
01:17:56,440 --> 01:17:59,240
And then he was like, bro, I can't.

1157
01:17:59,260 --> 01:18:00,520
I'm leaving.

1158
01:18:01,340 --> 01:18:02,580
There's too much.

1159
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:10,380
I was just like...

1160
01:18:10,380 --> 01:18:12,020
I was like, I'm scared.

1161
01:18:16,420 --> 01:18:18,740
I was like, oh, my God!

1162
01:18:18,860 --> 01:18:20,680
I was like, oh, my God!

1163
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:23,280
Anyway, guys.

1164
01:18:23,720 --> 01:18:24,480
Anyway, guys.

1165
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:25,820
I'm going to head off now.

1166
01:18:26,040 --> 01:18:27,100
I'm going to sleep.

1167
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:29,100
It's so late.

1168
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:29,900
It's so late.

1169
01:18:29,960 --> 01:18:30,520
Anyway, guys.

1170
01:18:30,740 --> 01:18:32,600
As always, I hope I'll be back soon.

1171
01:18:32,680 --> 01:18:34,080
I'll be back very soon.

1172
01:18:34,360 --> 01:18:35,700
As always, everybody, stay hydrated.

1173
01:18:36,460 --> 01:18:37,040
Posture check.

1174
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:39,040
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

1175
01:18:39,160 --> 01:18:42,760
And if you stay up for me, head to bed, because you deserve it.

1176
01:18:42,860 --> 01:18:44,720
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

1177
01:18:45,820 --> 01:18:46,540
Bye, guys.

1178
01:18:47,340 --> 01:18:47,700
Bye.

1179
01:18:48,620 --> 01:18:49,060
Oh, my gosh.

1180
01:18:49,100 --> 01:18:49,600
Give me a sec.

1181
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:52,700
I realize I have no ending screen, so it's just going to be like...

1182
01:18:55,140 --> 01:18:57,520
It's going to cut off.

1183
01:18:57,620 --> 01:18:59,100
I can't do it, because...

1184
01:18:59,100 --> 01:18:59,700
Oh, my God.

1185
01:18:59,740 --> 01:19:04,400
I can't end the stream, because my goal line thing is...

1186
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:05,040
Oh, my God.

1187
01:19:05,080 --> 01:19:05,700
Where is it?

1188
01:19:05,900 --> 01:19:06,680
Oh, there it is.

1189
01:19:06,760 --> 01:19:06,940
All right.

1190
01:19:07,020 --> 01:19:07,940
It's just going to be like...

1191
01:19:07,940 --> 01:19:08,720
It just ends.

1192
01:19:08,860 --> 01:19:09,060
All right.

1193
01:19:09,160 --> 01:19:09,660
See you, guys.

1194
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:10,680
This is where it's going to end.

1195
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:11,860
All right, guys.

1196
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:12,400
Bye.
