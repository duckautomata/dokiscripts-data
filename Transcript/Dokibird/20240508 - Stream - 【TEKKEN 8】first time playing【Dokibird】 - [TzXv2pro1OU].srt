1
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:50,570
Oh my god, the first challenge.

2
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:51,630
Oh, sorry, I was late.

3
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:54,790
The first challenge was getting this game to fucking work on PC!

4
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:05,350
I was just like... I spent an hour just trying to fucking figure out how to get this game to run!

5
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:11,650
And then, thank god you guys... I should have asked you guys for help in the beginning because I was just like, how?

6
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:14,830
How do I make this work?

7
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:17,410
Oh, so I've never seen this intro, so I guess we watch this intro.

8
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:19,250
Look, it's a pretty bird!

9
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:21,170
That's me, I'm that bird.

10
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:28,850
Oh my god, who are all these characters?

11
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:34,690
The only guy I know is like, King, because he's like half jaguar or some shit.

12
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:41,630
Oh my god, this is so hard.

13
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:42,370
This song is hype.

14
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:44,570
Is Sound Guy here?

15
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:47,630
Yeah, I had to do admin mode and then compatibility.

16
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:50,190
That's how we had to do this.

17
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:52,550
It was the first challenge.

18
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:57,930
The first challenge in this game.

19
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:03,090
Alright, Sound Guy, good, you're here.

20
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:05,770
I don't know any of these characters.

21
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:09,550
I'm literally going in blind as a...

22
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:15,190
I'm going in fucking blind.

23
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:20,990
I have overall 10 minutes of tech and gameplay over in the series in general.

24
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:31,190
Fighting game wise, maybe like a couple of hours, but that was because I was like, that was Lil Doki playing the Marvel slash Street Fighter arcade machines.

25
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:36,070
Whoa, there he is!

26
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:36,550
There's King!

27
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:40,730
Where are these other guys?

28
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:47,110
Oh my god, he has a gun!

29
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:48,010
Wait, is he OP?

30
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:48,750
Yes.

31
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:53,610
That's all I know.

32
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:54,410
He has a gun.

33
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:55,910
Can I do anything with that?

34
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:58,450
Bro, thank you for the super chat.

35
00:03:58,530 --> 00:03:58,750
Thank you.

36
00:03:58,790 --> 00:03:59,310
Thank you.

37
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:03,010
The lore about Tekken is about a very dysfunctional family and daddy issues.

38
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:05,510
Gameplay is a panda and a space samurai.

39
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:06,450
Thank you for the super chat.

40
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:06,730
Thank you.

41
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:07,150
Thank you.

42
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:08,130
Wait, who's OP?

43
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:08,670
Oh, I'm not sure.

44
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:09,510
Who's meta?

45
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:13,330
Is anybody meta right now?

46
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:15,670
Tekken 8.

47
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:18,550
Alright, the issue is that how many times am I going to crash?

48
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:22,190
Because apparently you can crash a lot in this game.

49
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,950
Or am I just going to be picking Eddy?

50
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:30,270
Because everyone's like, go pick Eddy!

51
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:32,210
And then what was it?

52
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,070
Spam something.

53
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,650
Surely the people that might...

54
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:39,230
You can...

55
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:39,390
Okay.

56
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:40,130
Alright.

57
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:42,410
Wait, I'm using controller though.

58
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:43,570
Wait, do I use controller?

59
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:45,930
Uh...

60
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:48,310
Do I just use controller?

61
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:51,530
Pick the funny Eddy, my beloved.

62
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:52,910
What's 3?

63
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:55,050
You guys just can't say 3!

64
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:57,010
I don't know what 3 is!

65
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:59,010
Like, which controller?

66
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:00,570
I'm using an Xbox controller.

67
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:03,130
Do I use controller or keyboard?

68
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:04,850
Tekken is 3.

69
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:07,650
Okay.

70
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:08,550
Which...

71
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:09,370
What's 3?

72
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:12,430
Okay, I assume that...

73
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:13,290
What is 3?

74
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:14,570
There's no 3 here!

75
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:16,250
It starts at 12!

76
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:19,830
What do you guys mean 3?

77
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:21,690
It starts at 12!

78
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:23,730
No, it starts at 5!

79
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:25,890
There's not even a 3 anywhere!

80
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:28,090
There's not even...

81
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:30,950
It literally starts at 4!

82
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:33,330
It starts at 4 and not 3?

83
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:34,870
Like...

84
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:35,390
Like...

85
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:41,490
It starts at 4 and not 3?

86
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:42,790
So...

87
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:46,290
So yes, the reason why...

88
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:47,690
Mercy, thank you for the super chat!

89
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:48,410
Thank you, thank you!

90
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:49,410
Meta is too hard.

91
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:51,830
Spam A on Eddy or spam Y on Victor.

92
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:52,310
Oh, A!

93
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:53,030
Okay, that's great.

94
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:54,170
I love the A button.

95
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:56,490
I love the A button.

96
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:58,910
Okay.

97
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:04,150
So, the reason why I'm playing Tekken at the moment is because I got invited to the...

98
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:05,630
Was it the Seijam...

99
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:08,830
Seijam Slam tournament?

100
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:10,010
Seijam?

101
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:10,690
Se...

102
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:11,470
I'm sorry!

103
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:13,370
Because that's the word I should say!

104
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:14,290
Seijam?

105
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:14,990
Seijam?

106
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:15,870
Seijam?

107
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:17,490
Is it Seijam or Seijam?

108
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:22,970
Seijam.

109
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:25,790
Okay, Seijam Slam 2 tournament.

110
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:27,750
And I have 0 experience.

111
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:29,750
I was like, but I have 0 experience.

112
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:31,010
And they're like, perfect.

113
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:38,390
I'm just as surprised as you guys that I'm in the tournament as well.

114
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:42,410
I literally told him.

115
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:44,170
He's like, oh my gosh, you invited me.

116
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:45,790
I was like, but I have 0 experience.

117
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:47,290
And he's like, perfect.

118
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:48,530
That's what we need.

119
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:50,050
I was like, okay.

120
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:55,890
Little does he know, I also have 0 experience overall.

121
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:59,270
The perfect target.

122
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:01,210
DDragon, thank you for the super chat.

123
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:01,890
Thank you, thank you.

124
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:03,090
Correct me if I'm wrong.

125
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:07,250
But 1 equals X, 2 equals Y, A equals 3, and 4 equals B.

126
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:09,890
Also, King has a couple of grabs that do a ton of damage.

127
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:10,930
And newbies cannot break.

128
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:12,070
Thank you for the super chat.

129
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:13,030
Thank you, thank you.

130
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:16,970
So, yes, I'm very thankful to get invited as well.

131
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:21,210
For those who also don't know, I also got invited to the Nokia Apex tournament.

132
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:22,470
I knew about this for a while.

133
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:23,730
And I was just waiting for it to be announced.

134
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:26,430
They even sent me like a welcome pack.

135
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:29,650
Like they sent everybody who's participating a welcome package.

136
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:31,150
I haven't received it yet.

137
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:33,070
But I won't spoil it.

138
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:34,890
I'll tell you who's in my team.

139
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:37,490
We have a team going in already.

140
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:39,550
It's a hide and seek tournament too, by the way.

141
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:42,170
Yeah, I just retweeted it.

142
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,030
I just quote retweeted it.

143
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:49,450
But we got invited to a Nokia hide and seek Apex tournament.

144
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:51,310
That's happening at the end of the month.

145
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:54,510
You guys are going to find out who's on my team later on.

146
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:57,750
Whenever it's revealed, I have no idea when it's going to be revealed.

147
00:07:57,970 --> 00:07:58,570
I didn't.

148
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:00,270
I just found out they tweeted it out today.

149
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:02,670
And then they were like, oh, quote retweet it when you can.

150
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:04,630
So I was like, okay, I'll do my part.

151
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:06,070
I'm going to do my part.

152
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:06,530
But it's okay.

153
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:08,290
There's a lot of pro players in here.

154
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:09,670
But like it's hide and seek.

155
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:11,190
So it's like, what are you going to do?

156
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:11,950
Hide better?

157
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:18,610
Like if anything, I'll just follow where the pros are hiding and then grief them if I have to.

158
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:23,830
Yeah, this is the one that this guy's toasting.

159
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:24,810
Wig is hosting.

160
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:26,190
Yeah.

161
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:29,530
No, but thank you.

162
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:30,210
Thank you.

163
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:30,710
Thank you.

164
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:34,470
French Gil, Victor, go Pew Pew teleport Pew Pew.

165
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:35,230
Thank you for the super chat.

166
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:35,570
Thank you.

167
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:36,190
Thank you.

168
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:37,850
And as they give a super chat, thank you.

169
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:38,150
Thank you.

170
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:42,770
The fighting game bell curve means by having zero experience, you might be many with limited experience.

171
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:43,570
Think of the super chat.

172
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:43,890
Thank you.

173
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:44,490
Thank you.

174
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:56,850
So, yeah, I have no idea what to expect in this Tekken 8 tournament because I have no experience at all other than button mashing.

175
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:57,310
So.

176
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:00,570
So.

177
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:05,310
I can button mash better than all those other newbies out there.

178
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:11,050
If they don't know what I'm going to do, how do they counter?

179
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:12,110
Exactly.

180
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:16,330
If I have zero patterns, how do they counter me?

181
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:19,750
I'm that unpredictable.

182
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:21,630
Exactly.

183
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:25,310
I don't know what they're going to be doing, but I know my strat.

184
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:28,870
Is that it?

185
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:29,290
Next?

186
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:30,250
Okay, there you go.

187
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:31,630
Cross platform.

188
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:35,030
Do I have one cross platform or should I just play with all the PC people?

189
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:36,750
Cross platform.

190
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:41,510
Okay, if all else fails and I actually can't...

191
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:52,150
If all else fails and like I'm actually that too stupid to recognize patterns, I have button mashing my beloved will be here for me.

192
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:54,990
Barely.

193
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:55,490
Barely.

194
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:56,550
Can you barely see the image?

195
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:58,170
I don't even see it at all.

196
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:01,350
I don't even see it at all.

197
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,370
We'll just go with equal.

198
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:04,230
Alright.

199
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:05,970
Is that...

200
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:06,670
There we go.

201
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:08,730
Benchmark score 1028.

202
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:09,370
Is that good?

203
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:10,490
I can't tell.

204
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:11,490
In order to optimize performance.

205
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:12,830
Alright.

206
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,850
This game has an auto save.

207
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:15,450
Okay, cool.

208
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:18,410
Alright, here we go.

209
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:20,550
They have coaches?

210
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:21,490
That's true.

211
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:22,550
But am I coachable?

212
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:25,330
Please enter your player's name.

213
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:25,970
Alright, sure.

214
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:27,510
Real...

215
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:27,730
Oh, wait.

216
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:29,250
Everybody's gonna see this name.

217
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:29,950
So I should...

218
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:30,690
Actually...

219
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:36,510
Everybody's gonna see this name.

220
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:37,810
Wait, I can't type.

221
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:38,610
How the fuck?

222
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:39,870
Please use your keyboard.

223
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:41,570
I'm literally trying to type my name.

224
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:44,270
Wait, what?

225
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:47,350
It's not even...

226
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:48,150
It's not...

227
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:50,890
My keyboard's actually not registering.

228
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:52,770
Oh my god.

229
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:55,770
I have no name.

230
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:57,490
I can't...

231
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:57,890
I can't!

232
00:10:58,130 --> 00:10:59,370
I want to!

233
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:02,130
I actually can!

234
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,450
Oh my god!

235
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:06,030
Oh wait.

236
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:07,430
Okay, there we go.

237
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:08,330
Oh, there we go.

238
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:09,350
I figured out real.

239
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:10,510
Okay.

240
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:13,530
There we go.

241
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:16,690
What's my name?

242
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:17,790
There we go.

243
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:18,270
Here we go.

244
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:20,550
Registration complete.

245
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:21,310
There we go.

246
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:21,690
We did it.

247
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:23,730
So real.

248
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:25,190
So real.

249
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:27,410
So real.

250
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:28,390
Yeah.

251
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:29,310
Look, Eddy!

252
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:30,930
Should I buy Eddy right now?

253
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:31,810
Wait.

254
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:34,870
We'll be releasing an additional player.

255
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:36,330
Do I have Eddy unlocked?

256
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:37,490
Wait, guys.

257
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:38,350
Give me a sec.

258
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:39,170
I need to know.

259
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:40,890
Do I have to buy Eddy?

260
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:43,510
He's my...

261
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:44,870
He's my trump card.

262
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:50,070
It's time to buy Eddy.

263
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,270
Do I have him?

264
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:53,870
Eddy...

265
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:55,430
How do I buy Eddy?

266
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:56,870
How do I buy him?

267
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:58,990
Not buy him?

268
00:11:59,130 --> 00:11:59,530
Wait.

269
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:00,390
Do I have him?

270
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:01,730
I can't tell.

271
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:03,970
Because I got Tekken 8 for free.

272
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:06,030
Guys, this is why I got him.

273
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:07,070
This is a...

274
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:10,150
This is a joke?

275
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:10,930
Okay.

276
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:13,470
I need to preface that this is a joke.

277
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:14,790
But...

278
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:17,810
This is why I joined.

279
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:19,250
I got Tekken 8 for free.

280
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:26,670
Huge shout out.

281
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:27,250
They actually...

282
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:29,570
They gave me a free copy of Tekken 8.

283
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:31,430
So I didn't have to buy it.

284
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:34,610
A huge, huge shout out to them for actually...

285
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:36,090
This is a joke, by the way.

286
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:38,310
Because I was gonna buy Tekken 8 regardless.

287
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:40,890
But free is free, you know?

288
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:42,230
Free...

289
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:43,450
Free is free.

290
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:44,870
Nice.

291
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:45,550
Alright.

292
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:47,070
Okay.

293
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:47,930
Introduced.

294
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:48,230
Okay.

295
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:49,390
How do I...

296
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:49,610
Okay.

297
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:50,230
Customization.

298
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:52,370
Where's like options?

299
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:52,930
Okay.

300
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:53,510
Options.

301
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:55,270
Alright.

302
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:56,150
Sound settings.

303
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:57,650
How's the sound, by the way?

304
00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:00,350
I mean, I feel like voice has to be always up.

305
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:02,030
Yay!

306
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:03,790
Free game!

307
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:05,170
Woo!

308
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:06,590
I love it!

309
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:07,510
Okay.

310
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:09,610
Button map.

311
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:09,950
Okay.

312
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:10,890
We don't need to know any of that.

313
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:11,870
Alright.

314
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:12,430
Let's see.

315
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:13,350
Offline mode.

316
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:16,430
Quick match.

317
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:19,290
Maybe I'll do one quick match and just see how...

318
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:20,730
How fucked I get.

319
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:22,630
No, let's just go straight in.

320
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:23,450
Okay.

321
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:25,250
So, I'm gonna go straight in.

322
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:27,370
Bring music.

323
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:27,650
Okay.

324
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:28,850
Enjoy battling with new style.

325
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:34,750
Use techin' aids to easily master your favorite characters' unique moves and combos.

326
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:36,150
Even if you're new to using...

327
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,330
Enjoy fighting without to memorize.

328
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:38,130
Oh, cool!

329
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:42,130
Press X to unleash a heat engager, ideal for offensive play.

330
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:45,350
If heat is already activated, your heat here...

331
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:46,400
Quick match is...

332
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:49,010
Quick match is what?

333
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:50,410
Oh my god.

334
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:54,330
Press Y for a combo starter.

335
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:55,230
Press Y for a combo starter.

336
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:56,970
Press Y to repeatedly...

337
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:58,650
How many instructions are there?

338
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:05,110
Press A, you can activate power crush, a counter attack used when getting attacked.

339
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:08,090
Press A when you think an opponent is...

340
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:08,970
Oh, this is a counter!

341
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:09,690
Okay.

342
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:15,110
Draws can be performed with B, B, B.

343
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:15,810
Okay.

344
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:17,210
Okay.

345
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:20,850
RB is a button that unleashes the heat system's special moves.

346
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:24,950
Perform a heat smash by pressing RB.

347
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:28,490
During heat, you'll go into a rage mode when your health is low.

348
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:31,750
This boosts your attack power and you'll be able to use your rage art with RT.

349
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:33,130
Rage...

350
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:34,670
What the fuck am I?

351
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:36,450
Turn on special style?

352
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:38,310
Should I turn it on?

353
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:41,330
Do I...

354
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:43,730
Do I turn on special?

355
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:48,590
No?

356
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:51,430
Okay.

357
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:54,470
Maybe I shouldn't be in quick match.

358
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:54,930
Okay.

359
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:59,890
Fight against a CPU opponent to calculate your starting rank.

360
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:02,590
They will still be dedicated based on your performance in battle.

361
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:05,490
In all live matches, you will be matched against...

362
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:05,750
Okay.

363
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:07,970
Alright.

364
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:10,190
Can I pause CPU battles?

365
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:13,190
Choose...

366
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:14,490
I won't be on the left side.

367
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:16,230
Okay.

368
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:17,110
Where's Eddy?

369
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:18,050
No!

370
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,370
I don't have Eddy!

371
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:22,090
Did my game crash?

372
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:24,470
How do I select?

373
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:24,930
I don't have Eddy.

374
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:26,250
All right.

375
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:26,570
Sweet!

376
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:33,470
Oh.

377
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:38,810
I'm loading.

378
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:39,470
Oh.

379
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:39,830
Okay.

380
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:40,370
Okay.

381
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:41,470
I'm loading.

382
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:42,430
It crashed?

383
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:43,510
I can't tell!

384
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:46,710
This game has baited me for so long!

385
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:48,250
It crashed!

386
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:53,890
It actually- I can't tell if I've crashed or not!

387
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:55,170
Oh!

388
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:56,770
Special style equals aim assistance?

389
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:57,350
That should not have happened!

390
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:58,630
Can I turn on special style?

391
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:00,610
Zeno, thank you for the super chat.

392
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:01,590
Thank you, thank you.

393
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,050
I can't tell!

394
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:07,190
Is it crushed?

395
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:11,030
That's not it this week.

396
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:16,610
Am I...

397
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:18,530
Am I still in?

398
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:21,610
No, actually a deep...

399
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:23,010
No!

400
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:26,410
I can't tell!

401
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:30,170
This game has baited me for so long!

402
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:33,630
I can't tell if it's crushed or not!

403
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:44,010
Guys, I actually can't tell I crashed.

404
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:45,590
Never mind, I can tell.

405
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:50,010
Never mind.

406
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,670
This music is here forever.

407
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:53,390
Oh, oh.

408
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:59,030
We're just going to listen to that forever, I guess.

409
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:00,050
Okay.

410
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:01,050
Alright.

411
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:03,810
Well, we got to watch it a little bit.

412
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:04,550
That was fun.

413
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:07,070
Guys, we got into the menu.

414
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:08,910
That was pretty fun, guys!

415
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:14,750
The game stopped me from going into Quick Match.

416
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:18,290
Even the game knew it was a bad idea.

417
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:20,870
The game was like, Doki, please.

418
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:22,410
Play the tutorial.

419
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:25,570
I was like, but what if so?

420
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:28,470
But what if I go straight in?

421
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:31,110
You learn the hard way, you know?

422
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:34,290
It's like when those mama birds push their babies off a cliff.

423
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,450
To be like, if you don't fly, you die.

424
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:38,650
That type of deal, that's me.

425
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:44,950
If I don't fly, I die.

426
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:50,810
Look, the best thing about having overall 10 minutes of Tekken knowledge...

427
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:54,230
is that there's zero expectations of me.

428
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:55,830
So that's...

429
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:58,770
And I'm okay with that.

430
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:05,930
I'm okay with zero expectations.

431
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:08,470
Unlucky, thank you for the super chat.

432
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:09,290
Thank you, thank you.

433
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:13,650
Who would have thought Doki's first actual battle in Tekken is with Tekken itself.

434
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:16,810
Okay, we just need to get past like the...

435
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:20,830
We just need to get past the fucking main menu.

436
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:24,210
Alright, here we go.

437
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:27,270
You turned on the graphics?

438
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:28,990
I feel like I should.

439
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:32,310
That sounds very important actually.

440
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:35,870
Maybe that's why I crashed.

441
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:41,910
I didn't turn down anything, I just went straight in.

442
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:45,310
Alright, we gotta turn down the music and then also...

443
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:46,790
I already brought it up overall.

444
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:50,890
Guys, I didn't have time to set up my new PC.

445
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:52,410
I've been so busy.

446
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:56,390
This is a great start.

447
00:18:57,910 --> 00:18:59,630
What do you think of the game so far?

448
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:03,650
I mean, with my limited experience...

449
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:06,050
With my only experience being the main menu...

450
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:07,070
It seems pretty cool.

451
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:07,990
You know?

452
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:13,130
Only been in the game menu.

453
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:15,090
But like, other than that...

454
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:16,330
Seems pretty fine.

455
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:17,410
Alright...

456
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:19,530
BGM...

457
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:21,030
Okay...

458
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:22,270
There you go.

459
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:24,030
That should be good, right?

460
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:26,570
Am I in ultra mode?

461
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:27,450
Oh!

462
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:32,470
Okay.

463
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:37,770
That makes a little more sense.

464
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:42,070
Alright, here we go.

465
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:43,010
Yes.

466
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:45,950
That's a yes I am.

467
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:47,330
Alright, what else do I need?

468
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:48,730
Do I put on medium?

469
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:52,810
I think medium sounds like the best area to be in.

470
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:54,770
So I can...

471
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:56,470
That seems right.

472
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:58,230
That seems a lot better.

473
00:19:58,450 --> 00:19:58,710
Alright.

474
00:19:59,370 --> 00:19:59,810
Alright.

475
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:02,750
I'll bring it up a little bit more.

476
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:05,210
Okay, I'll bring up the sound volume a little more.

477
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,030
Let me know if it's better sound guy.

478
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:08,530
I brought up the sound a little bit more.

479
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:10,450
Running a skill...

480
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:11,850
Vsync off?

481
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:13,270
Okay, Vsync off.

482
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:15,630
Where's Vsync?

483
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:16,330
Okay, there we go.

484
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:17,610
Anything else that I should do?

485
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:21,870
Medium is premium.

486
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:22,790
Alright, bring it up.

487
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:23,270
Remove shadows?

488
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:24,950
Do I not need shadows?

489
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:25,470
Okay.

490
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:26,430
Shadow.

491
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:26,670
Alright.

492
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:28,070
There we go.

493
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:29,570
That should be fine now, right?

494
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:30,690
We should be good.

495
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:33,570
Now we don't have to see the pure sweat from this guy.

496
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:35,410
I'm dripping out.

497
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:36,530
Oh, I need a bite.

498
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:37,490
Guys, give me a sec.

499
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:38,190
I need to buy Eddy.

500
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:40,170
If all else fails, I have Eddy.

501
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:41,630
Alright, Tekken shop.

502
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:43,150
How do I buy Eddy?

503
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:44,650
I'm going to the shop now.

504
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:46,230
Guys, this is important.

505
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:46,950
Eddy!

506
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:50,390
Okay, I just need to buy the DLC, right?

507
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:52,590
I already have Tekken 8.

508
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:52,790
I'm going to buy the DLC.

509
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:54,150
Wait, how do I...

510
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:54,990
Eddy, there he is.

511
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:55,670
How much is he?

512
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:56,270
Is it $10?

513
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:57,270
I mean, that's fine.

514
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:03,110
If all else fails, I have Eddy.

515
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:05,250
I'll pull out the Eddy if I start losing.

516
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:09,550
Pay to win.

517
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:11,090
Let's fucking go.

518
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,290
I got Eddy, guys.

519
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:13,590
Guys, I did it.

520
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:14,070
I bought Eddy.

521
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:16,110
Alright.

522
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:17,550
That's all I need.

523
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:18,690
Alright, let's see.

524
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:19,510
Yay!

525
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:22,350
Eddy, you know what?

526
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:22,770
I'm going to buy Eddy.

527
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:24,090
I'll go with Eddy.

528
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:25,610
I think I can do a quick match now.

529
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:27,670
Wait!

530
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:30,190
Alright, fight me good!

531
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:31,210
One, two, one!

532
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:36,870
It's Eddy time!

533
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:42,110
Alright, it can't be that bad, right?

534
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:43,630
There's no way.

535
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:48,130
There's no way it's going to be that bad, right?

536
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:51,390
There's no way.

537
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:52,750
Let's go.

538
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:57,450
It can't be that bad.

539
00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:00,890
If I play Eddy, it should be fine, right?

540
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:04,350
All I do is just play Eddy.

541
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:07,870
What it's like to be...

542
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:12,250
But guys, I need you guys to not play Eddy though.

543
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:13,210
Only I play Eddy.

544
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:15,910
Chat, only I.

545
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:17,550
She's so sad.

546
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:18,270
What do you mean?

547
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:20,110
I'll just play Eddy.

548
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:21,870
It can't be that bad.

549
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,360
Press... what's 3 again?

550
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:26,860
A, right?

551
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,260
That's... is that right?

552
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:29,500
A?

553
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,780
How do I... How do people join my lobby?

554
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,860
I'm a real female.

555
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:36,940
Change your character?

556
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,760
Wait, how do I change my character?

557
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:41,060
So many things I need to know how to do.

558
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,760
Dragoons this time, show no mercy to our Oshii.

559
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,220
Unlucky, thank you for the super chat.

560
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,480
There's a password?

561
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,660
Oh, there he is!

562
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:53,260
Mighty.

563
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:53,640
Mighty ruler?

564
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:56,580
Wait, is that... is that scary?

565
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:58,840
Is that...

566
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,040
Trick dookies, beautiful.

567
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,020
Wait, don't pick Eddy though.

568
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:04,880
Don't pick Eddy.

569
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:06,060
Only I pick Eddy.

570
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,220
You're playing wrong without any story?

571
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:10,520
I don't need no story.

572
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,800
How do I change characters?

573
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,740
Guys, guys, I'm not ready.

574
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:15,200
How do I...

575
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,320
Change characters!

576
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:22,480
I'll be on the left.

577
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:24,040
Oh, there you go.

578
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:25,800
Oh, there you go.

579
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,960
Oh my god.

580
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,180
Oh my god, this took forever.

581
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:29,860
Eddy!

582
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,120
Eddy!

583
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,560
I brought up the volume, is it better?

584
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:36,620
Sound guy?

585
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:37,920
Guys, I'm Eddy.

586
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:41,300
Sound guy?

587
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:43,440
He might have played before.

588
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,480
How would you know?

589
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,860
Purple Rake might not be that bad.

590
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:49,820
Guys?

591
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:51,180
Look, see?

592
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:53,140
He has... His stats are at D.

593
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:53,240
Guys?

594
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:53,240
Look, see?

595
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:53,240
He has...

596
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:53,240
His stats are at D.

597
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:54,400
Guys?

598
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:54,400
Look, see?

599
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:54,540
He has...

600
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:54,540
His stats are at D.

601
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:55,320
It can't be that bad.

602
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,420
It can't be that bad.

603
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:00,460
Okay, don't do anything first.

604
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:02,180
Let me at least have one hit, Kaiser.

605
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,020
Let me at least...

606
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,500
Bring it up more after you get destroyed.

607
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:13,580
Because all I'm saying is if you're a real Dragoon, you would let me Eddy spam you.

608
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,020
Because all I'm saying is if you're a real Dragoon, you would let me Eddy spam you.

609
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,460
Is that the Street Fighter?

610
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,480
Is that Street Fighter?

611
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:22,520
Please, give me his... Don't, don't, don't come over yet.

612
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:23,240
Oh my god.

613
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,420
Don't come over yet, please.

614
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:27,220
Don't, wait, give me a sec.

615
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,220
Give me a sec.

616
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:30,160
Don't, don't come over.

617
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,020
What?

618
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,900
What the fuck?

619
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:40,470
Bro, calm down.

620
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:41,570
There's no friend.

621
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:44,890
Bro, calm down.

622
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:44,890
There's no friend.

623
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:45,590
I got a hit.

624
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:46,070
It's not a

625
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:49,680
hit.

626
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,700
I got a

627
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:55,900
hit.

628
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:55,900
It's not a hit.

629
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,480
Oh yeah.

630
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,360
Oh my god.

631
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,920
Guys, what the fuck?

632
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,980
I thought you were purple.

633
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:09,380
That's why you can't predict this, right?

634
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,720
That's fucking right.

635
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:12,420
You can't predict this.

636
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:17,440
Yes, I got a round.

637
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,320
That's fucking right.

638
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:21,020
Can't predict this.

639
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,320
You're not perfect anymore.

640
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,240
Not perfect.

641
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:29,540
That's fucking right.

642
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:33,540
I got a round.

643
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:35,720
You can't perfect this.

644
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,120
That's fucking right.

645
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:42,200
Oh, I don't know what I'm doing.

646
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,280
Because you can't predict this shit.

647
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,560
No way.

648
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,380
How do I spam three?

649
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,060
What is three?

650
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,680
I don't know what is three.

651
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,880
What am I doing?

652
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,640
Is this ping?

653
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,640
I don't know.

654
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,520
I don't know how am I spamming three.

655
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:05,620
Okay.

656
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,620
How do I block?

657
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:07,140
Okay.

658
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:07,140
How do I block?

659
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,640
What did I do?

660
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,120
Okay.

661
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,200
I did that.

662
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,260
That's right.

663
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,020
No predictions.

664
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:23,140
Literally only A.

665
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:24,100
Wait.

666
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:24,680
What did I do?

667
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:25,620
How did I do that?

668
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:28,640
How the fuck did I do that?

669
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,060
It's okay.

670
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,060
He didn't perfect me.

671
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,000
That's okay.

672
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,200
That's okay.

673
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,000
He didn't perfect me.

674
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:36,440
I won.

675
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:40,580
What the fuck is going on?

676
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,840
Good question.

677
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:43,860
Wait.

678
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:44,560
I tried to A.

679
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:45,660
Wait.

680
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:46,240
No perfect.

681
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:48,080
No perfect.

682
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:49,700
Shit.

683
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,660
He fucking backed me down.

684
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,100
It's okay.

685
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:59,300
I won the spirit because I took two rounds off of him.

686
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,700
And now he's...

687
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,520
Oh, that's fucking right.

688
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:04,820
That's fucking right.

689
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,600
That's fucking right.

690
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,000
Oh, shit.

691
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,080
I'm trying to spam A.

692
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:12,480
It's okay.

693
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:14,700
It's alright.

694
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:18,880
Did I really lose when I got two rounds off of him?

695
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,860
Did I really lose?

696
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:29,540
Is it truly a loss where I got two rounds off of this guy?

697
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,660
That's a king right...

698
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:37,760
I don't know, guys.

699
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:39,340
I think I...

700
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:41,660
I think I won here spiritually.

701
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,120
I think...

702
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,220
Fade actor.

703
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:46,220
Shake my head.

704
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,760
I'm thinking of the super chat.

705
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,160
Thank you.

706
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,940
Did you know what you're doing?

707
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,540
Absolutely not.

708
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,960
I told you.

709
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:54,960
If...

710
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,560
If it all fails...

711
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,280
Bring out the Eddie.

712
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:06,280
Let's watch these guys play and then we'll do the tutorial.

713
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,280
I'm willing to watch this.

714
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,740
How do I watch this?

715
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,600
Am I watching?

716
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:15,560
There are no winners.

717
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:17,780
All I'm saying...

718
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:20,940
All I'm saying is that I've managed...

719
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:21,860
Oh my god.

720
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,060
This guy is S+.

721
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:26,300
Wait, he wasn't even playing his hero?

722
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,260
Oh my god, this Hitman.

723
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,720
Wait, that's so cool!

724
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:37,320
The customization is crazy.

725
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:39,800
Alright I brought up the volume more now...

726
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:40,300
Sound guy.

727
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,620
Alright, here we go.

728
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:45,360
Oh, shit.

729
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,300
How do I get rid of the chat?

730
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:50,200
Chat display.

731
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,320
Alright, there you go.

732
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:52,420
All right.

733
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,420
If you lose this victory...

734
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:56,060
You're bad.

735
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:56,940
I'm...

736
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,740
Oh my god, look!

737
00:28:58,820 --> 00:28:59,540
Oh my god!

738
00:28:59,600 --> 00:28:59,800
Bro!

739
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:00,840
Look at him!

740
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:01,480
Okay!

741
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,400
Look at that!

742
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,180
Look at Kaiser!

743
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:03,960
Fucking...

744
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:04,920
Look at that!

745
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:08,360
This guy actually plays the game and look at how much he's losing!

746
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,320
Too cosplay.

747
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,520
I took a round off these two.

748
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,580
Oh my god, never mind.

749
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:17,880
Wait, these guys are equal.

750
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,260
These guys are like equal.

751
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,640
Man, you're... I feel like maybe I should go low.

752
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:28,980
The frames are pretty bad.

753
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,500
Holy shit.

754
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,360
I feel like they know what they're doing.

755
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,920
Cause they're actually blocking.

756
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,600
I feel like...

757
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,740
Oh my god!

758
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:46,900
They actually know what they're doing.

759
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:50,240
They're like figuring out each other.

760
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:50,880
Look how there's combos.

761
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:56,200
How do they do that?

762
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,900
Set up the PC.

763
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,220
But it's so much work.

764
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,740
And I have so much other work to do.

765
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:10,520
No keep button.

766
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:12,740
I was very clear on what I was doing.

767
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:13,740
Oh my god!

768
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,240
I told you guys!

769
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:17,820
If I button mash, nobody will know what I'm doing.

770
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:22,580
They can't like counter... They can't counter me if they don't know my patterns.

771
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:27,520
So he said it.

772
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,100
All I need to know is how to block.

773
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,900
I feel like if I realize...

774
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:37,920
I feel like if I realize how to block and then I button mash, things will be okay.

775
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:40,740
The more you play, the less frame drops you will get.

776
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:41,580
Oh, okay.

777
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,560
It's still compiling.

778
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:42,960
Okay.

779
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:44,760
But did you win the set?

780
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:46,680
I got two rounds off of him.

781
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,260
That's all I'm saying.

782
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,580
Hold back to block?

783
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:51,260
Oh, okay.

784
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:52,740
Hold back to block.

785
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:55,380
Oh shit!

786
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,140
He's getting absolutely destroyed!

787
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,960
Oh my god!

788
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,860
Guys, maybe I'm meant to be PurpleRank.

789
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:06,840
Maybe I'm meant to be Flame slash MightyRuler.

790
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:08,380
Hahaha!

791
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:12,300
Hold down back to block?

792
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:12,700
Alright.

793
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:13,640
Alright guys.

794
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,740
Guys, have fun in this custom lobby.

795
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,840
I'm going to do the tutorial for real now.

796
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,300
Guys, leave session.

797
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:21,620
Sorry guys, I'll see you later.

798
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,800
Apparently I have to actually...

799
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:26,000
Wow!

800
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:26,920
I got money!

801
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:29,100
I got million G's!

802
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:30,480
Wow!

803
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,200
Apparently I should actually know how to play this game.

804
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,340
Alright, what is the tutorial?

805
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:37,660
Is it the story?

806
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,080
Or is it offline?

807
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:40,080
Is it arcade quest?

808
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,080
Practice through an exciting...

809
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:45,340
Apparently I actually have to learn.

810
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:47,020
This mode...

811
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:48,580
Training...

812
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:49,740
Begins...

813
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:50,680
Is it arcade quest?

814
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:53,680
Arcade quest?

815
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:54,080
Okay.

816
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:55,040
Arcade quest.

817
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:56,800
Okay, I got this.

818
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,560
Okay, but for real.

819
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:00,400
Like, what do I actually play?

820
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:01,100
Hahaha!

821
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:08,820
Do I actually go full... Do I commit to the eddy?

822
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,500
Or do I... Do I play King?

823
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,400
Because apparently King is also like...

824
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,960
Good to... Good at destroying noobs too.

825
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,100
And I'm a noob as well.

826
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:19,180
So if... If I destroy the other noob first...

827
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:20,020
Then I win.

828
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:25,720
Play whoever looks cool.

829
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:27,460
But I want to play whoever is meta.

830
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:31,160
I want to play whoever... I can use as a crutch.

831
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:38,380
Whichever character I can use as a fucking crutch.

832
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,740
That's all I want.

833
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:47,540
There's always plenty of smiles and sounds of button clacking.

834
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,000
King... eddy... Okay.

835
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,080
Uh...

836
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:52,420
Alright!

837
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:53,680
Thank you for the gift and shit!

838
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:54,040
Thank you!

839
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:54,600
Thank you!

840
00:32:58,930 --> 00:32:59,610
Let's see.

841
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:03,850
There is no meta... The meta will change on May 9th.

842
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:05,630
Well, thank god the tournament... Wait.

843
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:07,070
Isn't it May 9th?

844
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:07,530
Oh wait!

845
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:09,030
It's already... It's not May 9th.

846
00:33:09,970 --> 00:33:10,410
Uh...

847
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:12,830
Do not play King.

848
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:14,050
As long as I can grab.

849
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:15,430
Is that all that matters?

850
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:17,150
As long as I can grab somebody?

851
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:19,610
I might not know what I'm doing, but I can grab someone?

852
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:26,650
King is hard.

853
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:29,610
Darkblade.

854
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:31,190
Meta this, Meta that.

855
00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:33,170
But have you ever met a girl before?

856
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:34,590
Thank you for the super chat!

857
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:34,970
Thank you!

858
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:35,490
Thank you!

859
00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:36,650
Where's your pal at?

860
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:38,210
They're supposed to be... Oh my gosh!

861
00:33:38,410 --> 00:33:39,290
I'll go look for them.

862
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:40,270
You guys head out without me.

863
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:40,870
Which one's me?

864
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:43,410
Okay, see you then there.

865
00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:45,390
Oh cool, I'll be there when the tourney starts.

866
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:46,290
Oh that's so cool!

867
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:48,810
Is this a lobby?

868
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:52,390
Cool, I'll be thinking of superchat thinking of the Yankee.

869
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:53,330
Yo, where you at?

870
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:54,210
This place is packed.

871
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:55,430
Where the fuck is Max?

872
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:56,810
Is that you, Dragoons?

873
00:33:59,010 --> 00:34:01,550
Let me know what you're wearing today and I'll come back for you.

874
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:02,070
Whoa!

875
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:04,270
He wants to know what we're wearing.

876
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:08,390
Wait, is this default?

877
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:10,390
I think I love default face already.

878
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:20,830
Okay, okay, I like the face already.

879
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:26,050
Is that face like... whatever you wear.

880
00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:27,850
Bro, I want to keep this face.

881
00:34:27,930 --> 00:34:28,650
I actually like...

882
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:34,690
Wait, wait, but I could be an absolute chat... oh wait, no.

883
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:36,950
Does the chat face work?

884
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:37,450
No.

885
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:38,490
Okay.

886
00:34:39,490 --> 00:34:41,650
He doesn't say this looks like a chat's face.

887
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:43,030
Okay, I'm going to keep this.

888
00:34:43,410 --> 00:34:44,550
I actually really like this way.

889
00:34:44,570 --> 00:34:46,450
I can be purple or yellow.

890
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:48,570
Wait, I can make a Dragoon.

891
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:50,250
I want to make a Dragoon.

892
00:34:51,450 --> 00:34:53,190
Okay, a Dragoon.

893
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:55,550
All right, here you go.

894
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:56,470
And then...

895
00:34:57,770 --> 00:34:58,510
Let's see.

896
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:02,570
Uh, what kind of hairstyle would work?

897
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:06,110
I guess this.

898
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:07,930
And then... oh yeah, this works!

899
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:08,210
Yeah!

900
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:10,590
Okay, how do I change the color?

901
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:12,290
Wait, how do I change the color?

902
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:12,950
Oh, there you go.

903
00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:13,130
Why?

904
00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:14,110
I read.

905
00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:16,110
There we go.

906
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:17,410
Okay.

907
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:18,530
This is a Dragoon!

908
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:20,690
That's a Dragoon!

909
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:21,490
What are you saying?

910
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:26,810
Now you guys have to like, root for me because if I lose, you lose.

911
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:32,410
All I'm saying, if I lose, you lose.

912
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:33,610
Because I'm playing as you.

913
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:34,930
Okay.

914
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:37,190
All right, let's see.

915
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:38,910
I want a beard.

916
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:40,330
What is that?

917
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:42,330
What's the.

918
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:43,390
Oh, there's a beard...

919
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:43,910
It's a beauty mark.

920
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:49,870
Okay, wait, wait.

921
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:50,870
Do I want...

922
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:51,950
Let's see.

923
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:53,870
Actually, we'll do this one.

924
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:54,750
Yeah.

925
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:56,430
And then...

926
00:35:58,190 --> 00:35:58,670
Yeah.

927
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:00,030
Perfect.

928
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:01,990
Perfect.

929
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:02,630
What is that?

930
00:36:02,650 --> 00:36:02,930
That's you!

931
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:03,890
It's you!

932
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:07,210
It's you!

933
00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:09,270
It's the dragons!

934
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:09,790
Dragons!

935
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:13,470
Alright, what do we want you to wear?

936
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:15,030
Cover everything up.

937
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:20,330
No, I worked so hard for this.

938
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:21,910
Oh, I can have hats too!

939
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:24,170
No, we can't cover this.

940
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:25,470
We can't cover this.

941
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:28,290
Okay, let's see.

942
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:32,470
Is there anything else?

943
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:34,250
Oh, wait, we should have a different...

944
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:36,390
We should wear something different though.

945
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:38,250
Let's see.

946
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:39,890
Oh my God, you guys can be edgy.

947
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:40,390
Do I have money?

948
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:41,210
I do!

949
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:42,270
I have money!

950
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:44,790
Alright, I want you guys to wear something edgy.

951
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:47,210
Oh my God, yes!

952
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:48,170
Yes!

953
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:49,710
For our king cosplay!

954
00:36:53,530 --> 00:36:53,950
Yes!

955
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:57,430
Alright, and then... What do you want for your pants?

956
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:58,510
I mean, I have a million dollars.

957
00:36:58,590 --> 00:36:59,290
It should be fine.

958
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:01,570
I feel ins... Why are you insulted?

959
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:03,610
You look beautiful!

960
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:05,550
Okay.

961
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:09,410
What do you think about what pants to wear?

962
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:10,510
Oh, short shorts.

963
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:11,550
Short shorts!

964
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:13,810
Oh, wait, there's more.

965
00:37:14,090 --> 00:37:14,710
Okay, wait.

966
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:16,990
Short shorts!

967
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:18,350
Alright, here you go.

968
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:19,610
This is our king cosplay.

969
00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:21,590
And then shoes.

970
00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:23,190
I actually like...

971
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:23,970
Yes!

972
00:37:25,930 --> 00:37:26,370
Yes!

973
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:30,630
Oh my God, you guys look fabulous!

974
00:37:32,890 --> 00:37:33,330
Uh...

975
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:35,890
And then we have a friendship bracelet.

976
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:37,370
But you guys don't see it.

977
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:41,670
You guys don't see the friendship bracelet.

978
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:44,210
It's here in spirit!

979
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:45,990
It's here in spirit.

980
00:37:46,450 --> 00:37:46,850
Alright.

981
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:47,750
Nice!

982
00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:48,330
I finished.

983
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:49,170
This is you guys.

984
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:52,050
Looks like someone court ordered to...

985
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:53,610
...been enjoying some month.

986
00:37:53,890 --> 00:37:55,370
Ginger, thank you for the super chat.

987
00:37:55,450 --> 00:37:55,730
Thank you.

988
00:37:55,770 --> 00:37:56,250
Thank you.

989
00:37:56,330 --> 00:37:57,250
Alright, finish editing.

990
00:37:57,830 --> 00:37:58,810
Save and exit.

991
00:37:59,070 --> 00:37:59,830
I'm the dragon.

992
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:04,220
I'm... Dragon!

993
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:04,660
Dragon!

994
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:05,360
You're looking at yourself!

995
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:06,640
You're beautiful!

996
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:09,680
Are you trying to say you're not beautiful?

997
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,620
Because I think you're beautiful!

998
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,120
Look at you guys!

999
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:16,900
I hope I didn't crash because I tabbed out.

1000
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:17,720
I'm good.

1001
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:18,640
There you go.

1002
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:26,360
I didn't think it was super...

1003
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:26,860
There you are!

1004
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:28,860
I was trying to think you weren't gonna show.

1005
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,760
Man, my heart's beating like crazy.

1006
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,160
I feel like...

1007
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,060
I feel electricity in the air.

1008
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:41,840
We've all been waiting for this game to drop for what feels like forever and a day!

1009
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:44,360
You see any free machines?

1010
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:48,520
Yo, this one!

1011
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:49,740
This is Tekken 8 at last!

1012
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:51,780
Oh, hold on.

1013
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:53,140
Did you play any of the previous games?

1014
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,360
Absolutely not.

1015
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,740
Play all the tutorials.

1016
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:57,440
Yeah.

1017
00:38:58,780 --> 00:38:59,480
Don't sweat it.

1018
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:02,360
Don't call me the Tekken prop and my local arcade for nothing.

1019
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:03,560
I can show you the ropes.

1020
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,020
No problem.

1021
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:04,880
Okay.

1022
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:05,620
Are we learning...

1023
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:09,140
Did I... did I crash?

1024
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:14,220
Guys, I got ready for the next battle and then I crashed.

1025
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:16,860
You fucking...

1026
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:22,280
Thank you for the super chat.

1027
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:23,440
Thank you, thank you.

1028
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:27,360
Wow, Doki, you're homeless, bread, sims, and cosplay looks off.

1029
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:31,000
Guys, I got ready for the next battle and then it was over.

1030
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:40,980
Please, let me at least do the tutorial.

1031
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:42,300
Please.

1032
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:47,850
Oh my god.

1033
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:48,930
Please.

1034
00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:50,610
That's all I want.

1035
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:55,230
I couldn't even get ready for the next battle, everybody.

1036
00:39:55,790 --> 00:39:56,650
No!

1037
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:03,930
I got baited.

1038
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:07,010
I got... I got baited.

1039
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:11,490
I can only enjoy...

1040
00:40:11,490 --> 00:40:13,290
the sound of the battle.

1041
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:16,510
Zachary, thank you for the super chat.

1042
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:16,830
Thank you.

1043
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:19,910
You made a character worthy of Dr. Krusty.

1044
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:20,730
Thank you for the super chat.

1045
00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:21,130
Thank you.

1046
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:22,150
Did I save?

1047
00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:23,970
Did I save my dragoon?

1048
00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:26,950
I was not ready.

1049
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:29,650
Yeah, I was absolutely not ready.

1050
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:31,090
Guys, did it save?

1051
00:40:32,450 --> 00:40:33,970
Did it save, guys?

1052
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:36,530
No!

1053
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:41,840
You just lost.

1054
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:42,940
Okay.

1055
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,000
Guys, no!

1056
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,080
No!

1057
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:48,600
I just want to get ready for the next...

1058
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:55,640
Don't you have a monster PC?

1059
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,540
Yeah, it's sitting outside my room.

1060
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,580
I haven't even unboxed it yet.

1061
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:05,380
I just didn't have the time to set up.

1062
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:06,460
I was so busy.

1063
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:08,940
I was so busy.

1064
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,280
Antonio, thank you for the super chat.

1065
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:13,580
Thank you.

1066
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:13,840
Thank you.

1067
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:15,100
Your very first super chat.

1068
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:15,740
Thank you.

1069
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:16,980
I really appreciate it.

1070
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:17,800
Antonio.

1071
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,320
Hey, thanks for accurately depicting my severe...

1072
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,340
feeling the love.

1073
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,520
Thank you for the super chat.

1074
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:24,880
Thank you.

1075
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:25,460
Thank you.

1076
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:27,640
Alright, we're going to lower the quality a little bit.

1077
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:29,040
Maybe it's the graphics.

1078
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:30,360
Maybe.

1079
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:32,360
Okay, medium.

1080
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:33,740
What else do we lower?

1081
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,200
What else can we lower though?

1082
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:37,760
Guys.

1083
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:43,740
But you need the PC.

1084
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:45,580
Maybe it'll get better.

1085
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:48,640
Maybe it'll get better.

1086
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:49,960
You don't know that.

1087
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:54,240
Go window mode.

1088
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:55,740
Would window mode actually help?

1089
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:58,580
At this point, go to 480.

1090
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:06,060
Anti-aliased?

1091
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:07,440
Okay, we're going to do it with...

1092
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,820
Maybe the anti-aliased will help.

1093
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,020
Alright, here we go.

1094
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:12,420
This is it.

1095
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:12,840
This is it.

1096
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:13,240
This time.

1097
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:14,880
I'm ready for the battle.

1098
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:15,560
I'm ready for the battle.

1099
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:21,050
Alright, this is it.

1100
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:28,950
This is going to turn this into a Dokian chat...

1101
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:31,750
while she finally sets up her new PC stream.

1102
00:42:32,310 --> 00:42:34,670
Dazzy, Dazzy, thank you for the super chat.

1103
00:42:34,810 --> 00:42:35,270
Thank you.

1104
00:42:35,290 --> 00:42:35,990
Thank you.

1105
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:38,950
This is it.

1106
00:42:39,110 --> 00:42:41,570
Please don't make me remake the dragons.

1107
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:42,670
Oh, yes.

1108
00:42:42,930 --> 00:42:43,210
No!

1109
00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:45,650
No!

1110
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:47,290
That's not me!

1111
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:52,800
Wait.

1112
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:53,520
Yes?

1113
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:54,740
No, that's not me.

1114
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:56,180
No!

1115
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:57,080
No!

1116
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:00,640
Please save my dragons!

1117
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:05,820
It didn't save!

1118
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:07,420
Oh, it did!

1119
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:08,760
Oh my god!

1120
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:09,760
I knew it.

1121
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:10,620
You're here forever.

1122
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:12,600
Airboy Ninja, thank you for the super chat.

1123
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:12,980
Thank you.

1124
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:13,560
Thank you.

1125
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:14,580
PC's haunted.

1126
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:15,920
I knew it.

1127
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:16,940
You're here forever.

1128
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:19,540
Now you got it.

1129
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:21,400
Yes!

1130
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:22,700
Yes!

1131
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:26,940
Tekken remembers.

1132
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:28,260
This is your...

1133
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:29,380
This is like...

1134
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:31,020
You know, what was it called?

1135
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:33,780
You know, like when they turn like Pokemon into human design?

1136
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:35,740
What's the word for it?

1137
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:38,400
That's your real design when you're a person.

1138
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:45,200
You know like artists who used to like...

1139
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:46,280
make like...

1140
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:46,500
Yeah.

1141
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:47,720
G-Jinkas?

1142
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:48,120
Yeah.

1143
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:48,760
That's...

1144
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:49,780
That's you guys.

1145
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:52,660
That's your G-Jinka form.

1146
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:54,040
That's your G-Jinka form.

1147
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:54,900
G-Jinkas!

1148
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:55,640
No!

1149
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:57,200
No!

1150
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:58,980
It's still okay.

1151
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:00,100
It's just loading.

1152
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:01,440
It's just...

1153
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:02,680
It's just loading.

1154
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:07,320
Your PC is actually dying.

1155
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:08,460
We're so...

1156
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:09,420
You're not ugly!

1157
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:11,200
You're not ugly!

1158
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:13,980
It's like the most accurate representation.

1159
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:16,440
Trust the...

1160
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:17,280
It's okay!

1161
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:18,360
Just trust!

1162
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,240
We didn't crash!

1163
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:21,560
It's just loading!

1164
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:24,280
Guys... No it's not!

1165
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,340
It's not crashed!

1166
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:29,960
Guys Tekken 8 has baited me so much!

1167
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:35,850
It's just bait!

1168
00:44:37,870 --> 00:44:43,190
If all else fails, I'll just use the Playstation version of Tekken.

1169
00:44:43,550 --> 00:44:45,370
Just ask me...

1170
00:44:50,770 --> 00:44:51,250
No!

1171
00:44:51,470 --> 00:44:53,050
It can't have crashed!

1172
00:44:53,230 --> 00:44:54,510
There's no way!

1173
00:44:56,470 --> 00:44:56,950
Please!

1174
00:44:56,950 --> 00:44:58,170
At least let me...

1175
00:44:58,170 --> 00:44:59,530
Alright, we're gonna do window mode.

1176
00:44:59,650 --> 00:45:01,590
Why does it take forever to load?

1177
00:45:01,710 --> 00:45:02,810
I don't understand!

1178
00:45:04,190 --> 00:45:05,150
Alright guys...

1179
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:07,350
Alright guys, we're gonna...

1180
00:45:08,290 --> 00:45:11,250
Guys, we might have crashed.

1181
00:45:11,290 --> 00:45:12,350
Or it might have been...

1182
00:45:13,090 --> 00:45:14,710
I think you guys were right.

1183
00:45:14,790 --> 00:45:15,970
We should have done windowed mode.

1184
00:45:16,610 --> 00:45:18,070
You know, it's fine.

1185
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:19,850
It's funny that... You know what's great guys?

1186
00:45:20,030 --> 00:45:21,030
We gotta play...

1187
00:45:21,030 --> 00:45:23,170
We gotta play like one match.

1188
00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:31,310
No it's not dead!

1189
00:45:31,370 --> 00:45:32,330
Don't say that!

1190
00:45:33,410 --> 00:45:35,150
Alright, thank you for the super chat.

1191
00:45:35,270 --> 00:45:36,390
Thank you, thank you.

1192
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:39,230
It shouldn't change this to a PC set up stream.

1193
00:45:39,330 --> 00:45:40,270
Look, thank you for the super chat.

1194
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:41,010
Thank you, thank you.

1195
00:45:41,130 --> 00:45:41,570
Look!

1196
00:45:41,770 --> 00:45:46,470
I'll... I'll make sure I'll have the new PC ready before the tournament!

1197
00:45:46,470 --> 00:45:47,590
I swear!

1198
00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:49,870
I swear!

1199
00:45:50,610 --> 00:45:53,410
I'll have the new PC ready for the tournament!

1200
00:45:54,490 --> 00:45:56,270
Just not right now!

1201
00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:02,030
I just didn't have time!

1202
00:46:03,450 --> 00:46:05,730
50 FPS, that's almost playable.

1203
00:46:06,070 --> 00:46:07,090
Thank you for the Akka super.

1204
00:46:07,150 --> 00:46:08,610
Thank you, thank you.

1205
00:46:08,630 --> 00:46:08,950
Thank you for the...

1206
00:46:09,950 --> 00:46:11,350
Thank you for the super chat.

1207
00:46:11,410 --> 00:46:12,230
Thank you, thank you.

1208
00:46:13,310 --> 00:46:14,890
I get to play one match though.

1209
00:46:14,890 --> 00:46:16,870
I got that one match in me.

1210
00:46:17,090 --> 00:46:18,290
Alright, okay guys.

1211
00:46:18,430 --> 00:46:19,550
Let me play window mode.

1212
00:46:19,890 --> 00:46:20,850
Maybe that's it.

1213
00:46:20,910 --> 00:46:21,230
That's it!

1214
00:46:21,350 --> 00:46:22,390
This is what we needed!

1215
00:46:23,970 --> 00:46:24,470
Guys...

1216
00:46:25,070 --> 00:46:26,650
This is what we needed guys.

1217
00:46:26,930 --> 00:46:27,650
We'll play...

1218
00:46:28,390 --> 00:46:30,470
All we need is to...

1219
00:46:30,470 --> 00:46:32,510
Is to play window mode.

1220
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:40,310
That's all we need!

1221
00:46:41,750 --> 00:46:43,370
Razzy, thank you for the super chat.

1222
00:46:43,470 --> 00:46:44,310
Thank you, thank you.

1223
00:46:44,890 --> 00:46:46,290
Okay, graphics settings.

1224
00:46:47,330 --> 00:46:48,890
Alright, window... borderless.

1225
00:46:49,050 --> 00:46:49,490
Borderless?

1226
00:46:50,650 --> 00:46:51,870
Borderless should be fine, right?

1227
00:46:52,890 --> 00:46:53,410
Okay.

1228
00:46:53,830 --> 00:46:55,930
It's because I was playing on...

1229
00:46:55,930 --> 00:46:58,630
It's because I was playing on full screen.

1230
00:47:00,350 --> 00:47:01,930
Now I'm on borderless.

1231
00:47:02,130 --> 00:47:03,170
Now we're okay.

1232
00:47:03,850 --> 00:47:04,730
This is it.

1233
00:47:04,850 --> 00:47:06,330
I swear, we're not doing...

1234
00:47:08,090 --> 00:47:11,190
If I can't even fucking play the tutorial...

1235
00:47:11,190 --> 00:47:12,790
I'm just gonna go into a quick match.

1236
00:47:13,830 --> 00:47:15,270
I'll learn live.

1237
00:47:18,770 --> 00:47:19,850
I'll just...

1238
00:47:19,850 --> 00:47:21,570
I'll learn the game live.

1239
00:47:21,690 --> 00:47:23,490
With actual people.

1240
00:47:27,530 --> 00:47:28,510
There we go.

1241
00:47:28,730 --> 00:47:29,470
Skip movie.

1242
00:47:31,570 --> 00:47:32,330
Yeah!

1243
00:47:33,670 --> 00:47:35,890
You guys are finished editing!

1244
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:42,220
Guys...

1245
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:43,060
Guys...

1246
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:43,680
It's moving!

1247
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:44,920
The 8 is moving!

1248
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:46,720
Oh my god, there I am!

1249
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:48,660
Oh my god, there I am!

1250
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:50,180
I showed up!

1251
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:51,940
We showed up!

1252
00:47:52,820 --> 00:47:53,960
I knew it!

1253
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:55,740
It's all because of the borderless!

1254
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:58,960
Oh nice, it saved again.

1255
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:02,560
Alright, this is it.

1256
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:04,700
Get ready for the next battle!

1257
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:05,700
I'm ready!

1258
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:12,340
Guys, it might be stuttering.

1259
00:48:12,820 --> 00:48:14,780
But the 8 is moving.

1260
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:16,100
The 8 will move.

1261
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:16,900
It's moving.

1262
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:18,840
The particles are moving a little bit.

1263
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:23,620
It moved.

1264
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:24,400
It's okay.

1265
00:48:24,740 --> 00:48:25,260
Alright.

1266
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:27,620
X is left.

1267
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:28,600
Y...

1268
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:29,760
Right punch.

1269
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:30,700
B...

1270
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:32,080
Right click... kick.

1271
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:33,940
A... left kick.

1272
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:35,200
Okay, I got this.

1273
00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:36,180
Okay.

1274
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:38,660
Arm...

1275
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:39,640
Right...

1276
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:40,620
And then kick.

1277
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:41,160
Okay.

1278
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:42,100
We got it.

1279
00:48:42,740 --> 00:48:43,260
Oh!

1280
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:45,840
And then this is how I do the Eddy spam, right?

1281
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:47,820
But I'm not Eddy though.

1282
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,780
Just practicing my Eddy right now.

1283
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:51,900
On the wrong character.

1284
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:54,240
Okay.

1285
00:48:58,520 --> 00:48:59,160
We're fine.

1286
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:01,620
Alright, nice.

1287
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:03,580
Let's try some important man inputs.

1288
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:04,680
What the fuck?

1289
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:07,740
Oh shit, is that a combo?

1290
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:10,020
I can do that.

1291
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:12,960
Oh, look at me go!

1292
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:17,320
Uh...

1293
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:18,880
Directional input.

1294
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:19,880
Okay.

1295
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:22,380
There.

1296
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:23,720
I did it.

1297
00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:26,820
Wait how did I do that?

1298
00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:30,320
How do I do that?

1299
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:32,560
Did I do it?

1300
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:35,500
You see how I pressed the button early?

1301
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:38,020
How do I?

1302
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:38,900
How do I?

1303
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:39,300
That's it.

1304
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:39,500
Okay.

1305
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:40,600
Did I not do it?

1306
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:44,640
I didn't!

1307
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:45,780
See, it said great!

1308
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:47,860
There you go.

1309
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:50,500
I did it!

1310
00:49:50,740 --> 00:49:52,120
Wait, directional input?

1311
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:54,060
Oh my god.

1312
00:49:55,420 --> 00:49:56,220
Did I do it?

1313
00:49:58,200 --> 00:49:58,600
Yeah!

1314
00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:00,940
Robin, thank you for the super chat.

1315
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:01,320
Thank you.

1316
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:01,740
Thank you.

1317
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:03,080
Oh, I'm good to go now.

1318
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:04,100
You heard that?

1319
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:05,220
They said I'm good to go.

1320
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:07,620
Should I be using D-pad or...

1321
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:14,040
Guys, am I supposed to use the D-pad or the directional or the analog stick?

1322
00:50:17,770 --> 00:50:20,050
That PC is heading to the...

1323
00:50:21,690 --> 00:50:22,570
D-pad?

1324
00:50:22,890 --> 00:50:24,810
Oh, okay, because I was using the analog stick.

1325
00:50:25,010 --> 00:50:25,790
Okay, now I know.

1326
00:50:26,030 --> 00:50:28,030
Actually, that means losing your own health is bad.

1327
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:29,350
Yeah, of course.

1328
00:50:31,530 --> 00:50:33,610
Yeah, why are you beating me up?

1329
00:50:34,190 --> 00:50:35,650
Hey, hold you can... Oh!

1330
00:50:35,950 --> 00:50:36,770
That's how you block!

1331
00:50:37,250 --> 00:50:38,290
I figured it out.

1332
00:50:39,070 --> 00:50:40,070
Try to block and hack.

1333
00:50:40,390 --> 00:50:40,750
Boom!

1334
00:50:42,250 --> 00:50:42,610
Boom!

1335
00:50:44,310 --> 00:50:44,670
Boom!

1336
00:50:44,670 --> 00:50:45,250
Oh, wait.

1337
00:50:46,490 --> 00:50:46,850
Boom!

1338
00:50:48,350 --> 00:50:48,990
There we go.

1339
00:50:49,170 --> 00:50:50,470
I figured out how to block.

1340
00:50:51,970 --> 00:50:52,670
Look at me go.

1341
00:50:55,910 --> 00:50:57,250
All right, now I know what you're thinking.

1342
00:50:57,370 --> 00:50:58,370
You stand there and block everything.

1343
00:50:58,810 --> 00:50:59,330
You never lose.

1344
00:50:59,450 --> 00:50:59,630
Yeah!

1345
00:51:00,290 --> 00:51:05,730
But there's this issue of low attacks and throws that can't be blocked using... Oh, so I have to block by...

1346
00:51:07,490 --> 00:51:08,970
I have to like... go to the...

1347
00:51:08,970 --> 00:51:09,190
Go down.

1348
00:51:09,330 --> 00:51:09,630
Okay.

1349
00:51:10,130 --> 00:51:11,430
You can use a crouching.

1350
00:51:11,490 --> 00:51:12,970
Okay, to do a crouching block.

1351
00:51:13,510 --> 00:51:14,650
Okay, I got it.

1352
00:51:15,090 --> 00:51:16,450
Try to block a low attack.

1353
00:51:16,710 --> 00:51:17,030
Boom!

1354
00:51:18,830 --> 00:51:19,230
Boom!

1355
00:51:20,550 --> 00:51:20,950
Boom!

1356
00:51:20,970 --> 00:51:21,870
Just block everything.

1357
00:51:22,230 --> 00:51:23,870
If I block everything, they can never do damage.

1358
00:51:24,430 --> 00:51:24,830
Yeah!

1359
00:51:27,570 --> 00:51:28,090
That's right.

1360
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:28,330
Woo!

1361
00:51:30,610 --> 00:51:31,010
Perfect!

1362
00:51:31,010 --> 00:51:32,250
I lay out the basics!

1363
00:51:32,930 --> 00:51:33,830
I did it!

1364
00:51:34,970 --> 00:51:36,390
All right, tech unit heat system.

1365
00:51:36,670 --> 00:51:37,110
What's this?

1366
00:51:37,310 --> 00:51:38,410
Now I'm gonna teach you about the heat.

1367
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:40,250
It's a super important battle system.

1368
00:51:40,510 --> 00:51:44,770
If you notice that you have another gauge besides the health gauge, that's the heat timer.

1369
00:51:44,990 --> 00:51:47,610
When you have a heat timer, it means you're able to activate heat.

1370
00:51:47,790 --> 00:51:49,250
You start every round in this state.

1371
00:51:49,470 --> 00:51:50,230
How to do that?

1372
00:51:51,310 --> 00:51:51,750
Uh...

1373
00:51:52,330 --> 00:51:52,570
RB.

1374
00:51:52,930 --> 00:51:53,370
Okay.

1375
00:51:55,090 --> 00:51:55,530
Ooh!

1376
00:51:57,390 --> 00:51:58,250
Heat activated.

1377
00:51:58,370 --> 00:51:59,850
You can see the timer looks different now.

1378
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:01,750
Your character is stronger if you activate.

1379
00:52:02,090 --> 00:52:04,510
However, there is a time limit so you don't stay strong forever.

1380
00:52:06,310 --> 00:52:08,110
So you can only use it once per round.

1381
00:52:08,170 --> 00:52:08,950
So timing is key.

1382
00:52:08,950 --> 00:52:10,070
Oh, that's easy.

1383
00:52:10,250 --> 00:52:11,150
I'll just use it in the beginning.

1384
00:52:12,490 --> 00:52:12,830
Hahaha!

1385
00:52:14,390 --> 00:52:16,550
Also, moves are only available when heat...

1386
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:19,570
Try busting out a heat smash now.

1387
00:52:20,750 --> 00:52:21,350
That it?

1388
00:52:22,570 --> 00:52:23,010
Nice!

1389
00:52:26,190 --> 00:52:26,770
All right.

1390
00:52:30,610 --> 00:52:33,090
He smashes it and it's the only good thing about heat state.

1391
00:52:33,290 --> 00:52:34,170
You can only add...

1392
00:52:34,170 --> 00:52:36,850
You can also get the added bonus of chip damage with all your moves.

1393
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:37,950
Your opponent...

1394
00:52:37,950 --> 00:52:38,250
Oh!

1395
00:52:38,510 --> 00:52:38,930
So they're both...

1396
00:52:38,950 --> 00:52:40,470
They can't block my moves!

1397
00:52:40,890 --> 00:52:41,370
Technically.

1398
00:52:41,850 --> 00:52:42,730
I see.

1399
00:52:45,070 --> 00:52:47,930
Recommended air combo when heat activation activated.

1400
00:52:48,750 --> 00:52:49,430
What?

1401
00:52:49,610 --> 00:52:50,610
The fuck?

1402
00:52:51,450 --> 00:52:53,750
Tekken is all about the air combo.

1403
00:52:53,910 --> 00:52:54,410
And then...

1404
00:52:54,410 --> 00:52:54,770
What?

1405
00:52:54,930 --> 00:52:55,690
Is that it?

1406
00:52:55,870 --> 00:52:56,550
No.

1407
00:52:56,730 --> 00:52:57,190
Wait.

1408
00:52:59,210 --> 00:53:00,350
Did I do it?

1409
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:06,620
Heat activation during...

1410
00:53:06,620 --> 00:53:07,200
What?

1411
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:08,020
Okay, wait.

1412
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:11,260
And then I do it...

1413
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:11,520
Do it again?

1414
00:53:12,740 --> 00:53:13,140
Oh!

1415
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:13,540
Okay.

1416
00:53:13,620 --> 00:53:15,360
I forgot to press it the second time.

1417
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:16,200
Hahaha!

1418
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:18,380
All right.

1419
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:19,220
I'm learning.

1420
00:53:19,420 --> 00:53:21,180
I didn't read the last half.

1421
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:22,380
They got me in the first half.

1422
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:22,900
Not gonna lie.

1423
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:24,780
Master the ballast is next.

1424
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:26,200
You have to pick a character and get fighting.

1425
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:26,720
Okay.

1426
00:53:27,860 --> 00:53:29,280
They got me in the first half.

1427
00:53:30,060 --> 00:53:30,580
All right.

1428
00:53:30,940 --> 00:53:31,840
My game crashed.

1429
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:40,760
But I was so ready!

1430
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:43,860
I was so ready though!

1431
00:53:46,970 --> 00:53:49,830
I was so ready!

1432
00:53:51,110 --> 00:53:51,510
I was so ready!

1433
00:53:55,030 --> 00:53:59,100
I was about to pick everything!

1434
00:53:59,620 --> 00:54:01,080
I don't understand!

1435
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:03,060
Hahaha!

1436
00:54:04,860 --> 00:54:05,820
Hahaha!

1437
00:54:05,820 --> 00:54:06,120
Hahaha!

1438
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:07,580
Okay.

1439
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:09,660
I'll try DLSS.

1440
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:12,280
I got the shader error!

1441
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:15,340
I got the shader one.

1442
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:15,820
I got the shader error!

1443
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:16,840
Hahaha!

1444
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:17,720
Hahaha!

1445
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:20,700
I don't understand!

1446
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,740
I did everything for Tekken!

1447
00:54:24,460 --> 00:54:25,060
Please.

1448
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:28,160
The game got Doki in the first half.

1449
00:54:28,220 --> 00:54:29,180
Not gonna lie!

1450
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:30,300
Hahaha!

1451
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:34,620
I still have my PC set up before the tournament!

1452
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:35,580
I promise!

1453
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:36,880
I promise!

1454
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:39,460
Anton, thank you for the super chat!

1455
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:39,840
Thank you!

1456
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:40,480
Thank you!

1457
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:42,140
Broku, thank you for the super chat!

1458
00:54:42,140 --> 00:54:42,500
Thank you!

1459
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:42,920
Thank you!

1460
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:43,680
You're actually learning!

1461
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:47,300
I think you actually have a game sense and gaming skills become good at the game!

1462
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:47,920
Okay.

1463
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,220
I don't know how much copium you're on right now.

1464
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:52,200
Thank you for the super chat!

1465
00:54:52,420 --> 00:54:53,120
Thank you!

1466
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:53,880
Thank you!

1467
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:55,740
Okay.

1468
00:54:56,180 --> 00:54:56,800
All right.

1469
00:54:56,920 --> 00:55:00,520
It's time to go even lower than before.

1470
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:01,480
All right.

1471
00:55:02,020 --> 00:55:02,720
All right.

1472
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:04,980
All right.

1473
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:09,420
It's time to go as low as we can.

1474
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,040
It's time to go as low as we can.

1475
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:12,640
We don't need to see the graphics, guys!

1476
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:15,240
We don't need to see the man's pores!

1477
00:55:18,380 --> 00:55:20,400
So much hope you are doing well!

1478
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:21,460
Thank you for the super chat, Brian!

1479
00:55:21,620 --> 00:55:21,860
Thank you!

1480
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:22,520
Thank you!

1481
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:24,240
All right.

1482
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:27,180
Let's hope we can...

1483
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:29,160
We'll put everything...

1484
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:30,960
It's time to put everything on low.

1485
00:55:31,460 --> 00:55:32,140
It's time.

1486
00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:34,620
Okay.

1487
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:36,080
All right.

1488
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:39,040
We don't need to look at the man's pores, guys.

1489
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:41,800
Like, we don't need to know what's going on.

1490
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:42,520
We don't need to know what's going on with his skin.

1491
00:55:42,740 --> 00:55:43,540
All right.

1492
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:43,940
Let's see.

1493
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:47,120
What is this?

1494
00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:49,780
Is there DLS here?

1495
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:50,960
AMD.

1496
00:55:51,060 --> 00:55:53,460
AMD performance balance quality.

1497
00:55:53,660 --> 00:55:54,400
NIS.

1498
00:55:54,940 --> 00:55:58,240
DLS ultra performance balance quality.

1499
00:55:58,520 --> 00:55:59,760
There we go!

1500
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,520
That sounds about right!

1501
00:56:09,060 --> 00:56:11,000
There we go.

1502
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:14,040
We're on the quality sector.

1503
00:56:16,860 --> 00:56:17,420
Okay.

1504
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:18,780
Here we go.

1505
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:21,840
Not quality.

1506
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:23,640
Oh, wait.

1507
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:24,200
We won performance.

1508
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:25,180
Okay.

1509
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:26,720
Wait.

1510
00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:27,160
Where is it?

1511
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:28,280
Where's performance?

1512
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:28,860
Okay.

1513
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:29,460
There we go.

1514
00:56:30,340 --> 00:56:30,900
Performance.

1515
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:32,320
Not quality.

1516
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:33,680
Here we go.

1517
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:34,860
There it is!

1518
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:36,640
We'll be fine now, guys.

1519
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:37,620
Surely!

1520
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:39,400
All right, guys.

1521
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:41,770
We don't need arcade anymore.

1522
00:56:42,740 --> 00:56:43,500
It's time.

1523
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:45,360
Let's do the Eddie episodes!

1524
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:47,580
Where's Eddie?

1525
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:50,980
Select story mode difficulty.

1526
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:51,860
You know what?

1527
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:52,580
Medium.

1528
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:53,240
Let's go.

1529
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:54,100
Eddie.

1530
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:55,180
I learned how to block.

1531
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:56,420
Where's Eddie?

1532
00:56:56,820 --> 00:56:58,120
Where's E for Eddie?

1533
00:56:58,460 --> 00:56:58,980
Wait.

1534
00:56:59,020 --> 00:57:00,180
There's no Eddie episodes?

1535
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:01,800
Is he not important?

1536
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,840
I find Eddie important.

1537
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:06,500
Is there King at least?

1538
00:57:06,540 --> 00:57:07,200
There's no King?

1539
00:57:07,620 --> 00:57:10,620
How is he not important enough to have his own story?

1540
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:11,240
How is he not important enough to have his own story?

1541
00:57:11,340 --> 00:57:13,060
Oh, spicy.

1542
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:16,440
I guess we'll do the Dark Awakens.

1543
00:57:16,620 --> 00:57:17,740
I guess we'll do the Dark Awakens.

1544
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:19,360
Up until...

1545
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:21,940
Would you like to go before starting the story mode?

1546
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:23,400
For first time players.

1547
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:23,980
Okay.

1548
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:24,260
Sure.

1549
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:25,520
What's the story anyway?

1550
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:28,440
How long are these?

1551
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:30,520
Tekken 4 summary?

1552
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:31,140
Tekken 4 summary?

1553
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:31,480
Okay.

1554
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:33,560
Let's just read what's going on in 7.

1555
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:35,060
Okay.

1556
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:35,980
Let's just read what's going on in 7.

1557
00:57:36,380 --> 00:57:37,520
King is right.

1558
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:38,500
Right there.

1559
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:55,380
Who is that guy?

1560
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:58,360
Maybe I should not have started with Tekken 7.

1561
00:57:59,740 --> 00:58:03,920
Is this a spoiler?

1562
00:58:04,220 --> 00:58:04,960
I mean, it's Tekken 7.

1563
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:05,180
Seven?

1564
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:08,540
We've taken your gamer rig for granted.

1565
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:10,400
Gary, thank you for the super chat.

1566
00:58:10,460 --> 00:58:10,860
Thank you.

1567
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:18,660
Oh, this guy is dead.

1568
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:20,420
Whoever this guy is.

1569
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:39,980
Only we can stop... Kazuya?

1570
00:58:40,340 --> 00:58:41,140
I'm Kazuya!

1571
00:58:41,380 --> 00:58:42,340
I can stop Kazuya!

1572
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:49,680
The devil's blood.

1573
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:54,780
Oh my god!

1574
00:58:54,980 --> 00:58:56,080
He grew tattoos!

1575
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:57,940
We figured it out, guys.

1576
00:58:58,060 --> 00:58:59,140
We figured out the story.

1577
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:01,740
Alright, I guess that was the story.

1578
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:03,180
So can we play now?

1579
00:59:04,060 --> 00:59:04,920
Fight money.

1580
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:07,940
Why do I need to purchase... Oh, it says the gallery.

1581
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:08,920
Oh!

1582
00:59:10,220 --> 00:59:12,360
Wait, someone said King is actually in there.

1583
00:59:12,540 --> 00:59:13,000
Where's King?

1584
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:16,060
A, B, C, D, E, F... Oh, King!

1585
00:59:16,820 --> 00:59:17,720
Alright, let's try it!

1586
00:59:18,540 --> 00:59:20,920
Okay, apparently King grabs are good.

1587
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:23,180
King, that's me!

1588
00:59:25,660 --> 00:59:31,140
Wait, so why does he have a jaguar head?

1589
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:46,560
Because of the Because it's cool.

1590
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:54,200
He's so cool.

1591
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:57,880
Okay, it can't be a mask.

1592
00:59:57,960 --> 00:59:59,660
He's literally talking in growls.

1593
00:59:59,660 --> 01:00:01,380
Like, unless he's super immersive.

1594
01:00:02,020 --> 01:00:02,680
I'm getting old.

1595
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:05,720
Why not?

1596
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:09,700
That's me!

1597
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:14,480
He does it for the children.

1598
01:00:19,420 --> 01:00:20,040
That's me!

1599
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:24,500
I'll be fighting against the law?

1600
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:25,240
How do I grab?

1601
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:28,220
I realized I've learned everything but grabbing.

1602
01:00:28,380 --> 01:00:29,240
And that's this whole thing.

1603
01:00:29,620 --> 01:00:32,180
Witness the might of the undisputed champion.

1604
01:00:36,620 --> 01:00:39,660
Guys, I realized there was one thing I didn't learn.

1605
01:00:39,820 --> 01:00:42,000
Oh, but did you see the block though?

1606
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:43,800
Oh shit!

1607
01:00:44,260 --> 01:00:45,480
Oh fuck, okay.

1608
01:00:47,740 --> 01:00:48,220
Alright.

1609
01:00:48,220 --> 01:00:48,900
It's fine.

1610
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:49,940
It's fine.

1611
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:52,020
We gotta use this heat moment before the round ends.

1612
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:53,680
Oh shit.

1613
01:00:54,060 --> 01:00:54,720
It's fine.

1614
01:00:56,140 --> 01:00:57,960
Oh fuck, I still don't know how to grab.

1615
01:00:58,560 --> 01:00:59,360
That grab!

1616
01:01:04,220 --> 01:01:05,460
A or X?

1617
01:01:05,580 --> 01:01:06,740
Okay, A, X.

1618
01:01:06,980 --> 01:01:08,060
Or A, B.

1619
01:01:08,220 --> 01:01:09,160
Alright, I blocked that.

1620
01:01:09,180 --> 01:01:09,560
Two.

1621
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:11,520
Okay.

1622
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:12,140
There you go.

1623
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:13,160
I'm grabbing.

1624
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:14,440
I'm grabbing.

1625
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:15,700
Let me grab!

1626
01:01:15,980 --> 01:01:17,280
They don't know how to counter grab!

1627
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:17,920
Grab!

1628
01:01:32,310 --> 01:01:33,390
I did it!

1629
01:01:36,390 --> 01:01:38,170
Oh my god, this is it!

1630
01:01:38,250 --> 01:01:38,970
I'll just keep grabbing!

1631
01:01:39,590 --> 01:01:40,730
I figured it out!

1632
01:01:41,970 --> 01:01:42,690
It's over.

1633
01:01:42,810 --> 01:01:44,170
It's over for all the other noobs.

1634
01:01:44,510 --> 01:01:46,330
I don't even know how to break a grab.

1635
01:01:46,750 --> 01:01:47,470
It's over.

1636
01:01:48,170 --> 01:01:49,530
Oh shit, wait a minute.

1637
01:01:53,670 --> 01:01:54,350
Oh shit.

1638
01:01:54,550 --> 01:01:54,990
Oh shit.

1639
01:01:54,990 --> 01:01:54,990
Oh shit.

1640
01:01:54,990 --> 01:01:55,710
No, no, no, no, no!

1641
01:01:55,850 --> 01:01:56,890
Let me grab you!

1642
01:01:57,290 --> 01:01:57,690
Okay.

1643
01:02:00,150 --> 01:02:01,390
I got the strat!

1644
01:02:01,610 --> 01:02:02,530
Okay, maybe not.

1645
01:02:02,970 --> 01:02:04,910
Guys, maybe I should stop that.

1646
01:02:06,410 --> 01:02:06,850
Okay.

1647
01:02:07,270 --> 01:02:08,270
No, no, no, no, no, no!

1648
01:02:08,450 --> 01:02:08,890
Yes!

1649
01:02:10,170 --> 01:02:10,610
Yes!

1650
01:02:15,230 --> 01:02:17,850
No King's Lair knows how to break the grab.

1651
01:02:17,850 --> 01:02:19,510
It sounds accurate.

1652
01:02:19,870 --> 01:02:21,050
If I keep grabbing!

1653
01:02:21,790 --> 01:02:23,050
If I keep grabbing!

1654
01:02:23,270 --> 01:02:23,990
This is it!

1655
01:02:25,270 --> 01:02:26,290
I just gotta keep grabbing!

1656
01:02:26,470 --> 01:02:27,150
Let me grab you!

1657
01:02:31,750 --> 01:02:32,190
Okay.

1658
01:02:32,190 --> 01:02:32,630
Yes!

1659
01:02:33,050 --> 01:02:34,110
We figured it out!

1660
01:02:35,370 --> 01:02:36,030
Oh shit.

1661
01:02:36,630 --> 01:02:37,410
Oh shit.

1662
01:02:37,550 --> 01:02:38,030
I quit.

1663
01:02:39,350 --> 01:02:39,930
That's right.

1664
01:02:40,210 --> 01:02:40,830
That's right.

1665
01:02:40,890 --> 01:02:41,890
Can't counter the grab.

1666
01:02:42,290 --> 01:02:43,390
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1667
01:02:43,670 --> 01:02:44,110
No,

1668
01:02:47,810 --> 01:02:47,810
no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1669
01:02:47,810 --> 01:02:49,910
This is coming, King.

1670
01:02:49,990 --> 01:02:50,510
Alright.

1671
01:02:51,370 --> 01:02:52,770
Winner's playoff.

1672
01:02:53,550 --> 01:02:54,570
Winner's playoff.

1673
01:02:55,190 --> 01:02:55,710
Alright.

1674
01:02:55,890 --> 01:02:56,450
Here we go.

1675
01:02:56,750 --> 01:02:57,270
Alright.

1676
01:02:57,270 --> 01:02:57,270
Here we go.

1677
01:02:57,270 --> 01:02:57,990
We figured it out.

1678
01:02:58,150 --> 01:02:58,850
Go King.

1679
01:02:59,030 --> 01:02:59,370
Go.

1680
01:03:00,450 --> 01:03:02,790
How is she doing that?

1681
01:03:03,610 --> 01:03:04,370
How is she doing that?

1682
01:03:04,810 --> 01:03:05,330
Okay.

1683
01:03:05,770 --> 01:03:06,530
No one.

1684
01:03:06,530 --> 01:03:08,510
No, none of the noobs know how to counter grabs.

1685
01:03:08,990 --> 01:03:10,950
Because I don't know how to counter it.

1686
01:03:12,370 --> 01:03:13,230
Oh shit.

1687
01:03:13,350 --> 01:03:14,370
That's fucking right.

1688
01:03:16,090 --> 01:03:17,310
No, no, no, no, no.

1689
01:03:17,810 --> 01:03:18,710
No, no, no.

1690
01:03:18,950 --> 01:03:20,570
Wait, how you countered me?

1691
01:03:20,850 --> 01:03:22,070
You're an NPC!

1692
01:03:26,490 --> 01:03:27,570
That's fucking right.

1693
01:03:29,190 --> 01:03:30,250
That's fucking right!

1694
01:03:31,590 --> 01:03:33,050
How do you counter this?

1695
01:03:35,370 --> 01:03:35,930
No!

1696
01:03:36,070 --> 01:03:36,590
Oh shit.

1697
01:03:36,690 --> 01:03:37,210
Oh shit.

1698
01:03:37,470 --> 01:03:38,110
Don't worry.

1699
01:03:38,230 --> 01:03:39,510
I still can grab you.

1700
01:03:40,010 --> 01:03:41,310
That's fucking right.

1701
01:03:42,090 --> 01:03:42,930
Oh god.

1702
01:03:43,110 --> 01:03:43,890
Oh god.

1703
01:03:43,930 --> 01:03:44,090
No!

1704
01:03:44,250 --> 01:03:44,770
No!

1705
01:03:44,770 --> 01:03:46,390
He countered the grab!

1706
01:03:48,990 --> 01:03:50,010
No way.

1707
01:03:51,330 --> 01:03:51,890
Nice.

1708
01:03:51,950 --> 01:03:52,390
Nice.

1709
01:03:53,130 --> 01:03:53,690
Nice.

1710
01:03:53,810 --> 01:03:53,990
There we go.

1711
01:03:54,530 --> 01:03:55,250
It's okay.

1712
01:03:55,630 --> 01:03:56,410
It's okay.

1713
01:03:56,850 --> 01:03:58,030
I just keep grabbing.

1714
01:03:58,470 --> 01:03:59,830
I just keep grabbing.

1715
01:04:04,170 --> 01:04:04,910
It's okay.

1716
01:04:05,110 --> 01:04:06,050
There's no way.

1717
01:04:07,030 --> 01:04:07,830
There we go.

1718
01:04:08,470 --> 01:04:09,250
There we go.

1719
01:04:09,830 --> 01:04:11,050
That's fucking right!

1720
01:04:12,670 --> 01:04:14,250
Check the PC.

1721
01:04:14,890 --> 01:04:17,510
The NPC is learning about my grabs!

1722
01:04:18,050 --> 01:04:18,890
The NPC is learning about my grabs!

1723
01:04:18,890 --> 01:04:18,910
How?

1724
01:04:20,130 --> 01:04:21,450
How is he learning?

1725
01:04:21,810 --> 01:04:22,450
Oh shit.

1726
01:04:22,530 --> 01:04:23,430
Oh fuck.

1727
01:04:23,510 --> 01:04:23,750
Okay.

1728
01:04:25,370 --> 01:04:27,050
He's countering my grabs!

1729
01:04:27,570 --> 01:04:28,150
How?

1730
01:04:28,430 --> 01:04:29,870
I don't know how to counter.

1731
01:04:30,030 --> 01:04:30,690
Oh god.

1732
01:04:30,770 --> 01:04:31,170
Oh no.

1733
01:04:31,270 --> 01:04:31,730
Oh no.

1734
01:04:31,750 --> 01:04:32,590
He's juggling me.

1735
01:04:32,950 --> 01:04:35,550
Oh god.

1736
01:04:35,550 --> 01:04:35,550
Oh no.

1737
01:04:35,550 --> 01:04:35,550
Oh no.

1738
01:04:35,550 --> 01:04:35,550
He's juggling me.

1739
01:04:35,550 --> 01:04:36,110
Guys.

1740
01:04:36,390 --> 01:04:37,430
This might be it.

1741
01:04:38,010 --> 01:04:39,310
This might be it.

1742
01:04:39,770 --> 01:04:41,030
This might be it.

1743
01:04:41,170 --> 01:04:42,710
The NPC is learning.

1744
01:04:42,990 --> 01:04:44,350
He cancelled it.

1745
01:04:44,590 --> 01:04:45,970
How did he cancel?

1746
01:04:49,450 --> 01:04:50,230
Oh god.

1747
01:04:50,570 --> 01:04:51,310
Oh god.

1748
01:04:51,370 --> 01:04:51,510
No.

1749
01:04:51,550 --> 01:04:51,610
No.

1750
01:04:51,630 --> 01:04:51,770
No.

1751
01:04:51,770 --> 01:04:52,270
Nice.

1752
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:00,860
This is a strat!

1753
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:04,140
This is a strat!

1754
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:08,240
I just know xA and what was the other grab?

1755
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:09,740
Try up xA.

1756
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:11,060
Oh xY.

1757
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:11,280
Okay.

1758
01:05:14,220 --> 01:05:16,260
The AI is self-aware.

1759
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:18,240
Guys.

1760
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:18,760
Oh!

1761
01:05:18,900 --> 01:05:20,340
Why did I try xY?

1762
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:21,120
No.

1763
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:22,020
Oh no.

1764
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:23,120
He's learning!

1765
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:25,620
He knows my magic!

1766
01:05:25,860 --> 01:05:26,380
He knows!

1767
01:05:28,020 --> 01:05:28,880
Oh my god.

1768
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:29,620
How does he know?

1769
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:31,380
How does he know?

1770
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:36,760
Okay.

1771
01:05:38,340 --> 01:05:38,900
Nice.

1772
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:39,580
There we go.

1773
01:05:39,620 --> 01:05:39,740
Okay.

1774
01:05:39,740 --> 01:05:39,740
Nice.

1775
01:05:40,760 --> 01:05:41,440
There we go.

1776
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:42,360
Grab!

1777
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:43,280
Boom!

1778
01:05:44,080 --> 01:05:45,120
That's fucking right!

1779
01:05:45,540 --> 01:05:46,680
I'll just keep grabbing!

1780
01:05:46,900 --> 01:05:47,380
Oh shit.

1781
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:47,940
Okay.

1782
01:05:47,980 --> 01:05:48,360
Never mind.

1783
01:05:48,460 --> 01:05:49,120
I'm so sorry.

1784
01:05:49,220 --> 01:05:50,020
I'm so sorry.

1785
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:56,760
Nice.

1786
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:57,720
I'm doing it.

1787
01:05:59,180 --> 01:05:59,860
There we go.

1788
01:06:01,020 --> 01:06:01,660
Grab tab.

1789
01:06:02,380 --> 01:06:02,820
Okay.

1790
01:06:03,700 --> 01:06:04,520
Oh my god.

1791
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:06,300
It would be crazy if he knew.

1792
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:07,860
If actually people...

1793
01:06:07,860 --> 01:06:11,780
It would be crazy if the newbies actually learned how to counter the grab.

1794
01:06:12,060 --> 01:06:13,360
I would be so sad.

1795
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:19,720
That would be so sad.

1796
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:21,700
Because this is actually my whole strat.

1797
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:23,120
Oh god.

1798
01:06:23,340 --> 01:06:23,980
Oh god.

1799
01:06:24,020 --> 01:06:24,220
Please!

1800
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:25,120
No, no, no, no, no!

1801
01:06:25,240 --> 01:06:25,600
Yes!

1802
01:06:26,660 --> 01:06:27,180
Yes!

1803
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:28,220
The grab!

1804
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:30,200
Alright.

1805
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:30,760
Here we go.

1806
01:06:32,420 --> 01:06:34,840
He has multiple grab.

1807
01:06:35,640 --> 01:06:36,200
Hahaha.

1808
01:06:39,370 --> 01:06:39,930
Help!

1809
01:06:41,290 --> 01:06:42,410
There's coaching?

1810
01:06:43,070 --> 01:06:43,850
It's okay!

1811
01:06:44,350 --> 01:06:45,710
They're not gonna register!

1812
01:06:47,010 --> 01:06:48,450
They're not gonna register.

1813
01:06:50,930 --> 01:06:51,990
There's no way.

1814
01:06:53,890 --> 01:06:55,290
Try running and then grab?

1815
01:06:55,410 --> 01:06:55,770
Oh my god.

1816
01:06:55,810 --> 01:06:56,270
I should try that.

1817
01:06:59,130 --> 01:06:59,410
Okay.

1818
01:06:59,590 --> 01:07:00,030
Never mind.

1819
01:07:01,830 --> 01:07:02,390
Oh!

1820
01:07:02,670 --> 01:07:03,210
No!

1821
01:07:03,370 --> 01:07:03,950
I tried!

1822
01:07:04,090 --> 01:07:04,710
I fucking... Okay.

1823
01:07:05,370 --> 01:07:05,750
Okay, nice.

1824
01:07:05,850 --> 01:07:06,630
I got the grab here.

1825
01:07:07,910 --> 01:07:08,270
Nice.

1826
01:07:08,270 --> 01:07:09,730
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1827
01:07:09,990 --> 01:07:10,350
Block!

1828
01:07:10,670 --> 01:07:11,030
Block!

1829
01:07:11,390 --> 01:07:11,950
There you go.

1830
01:07:12,410 --> 01:07:12,770
Block!

1831
01:07:12,950 --> 01:07:13,630
No, come on!

1832
01:07:13,750 --> 01:07:14,110
Yes!

1833
01:07:14,230 --> 01:07:14,370
No!

1834
01:07:14,970 --> 01:07:15,670
Holy shit!

1835
01:07:15,710 --> 01:07:16,270
He's insane!

1836
01:07:17,650 --> 01:07:18,970
They have Steve Learn!

1837
01:07:21,790 --> 01:07:22,770
I can't believe it!

1838
01:07:23,370 --> 01:07:24,070
Steve Learn!

1839
01:07:26,670 --> 01:07:27,510
Did I grab him?

1840
01:07:27,590 --> 01:07:27,950
Nice.

1841
01:07:28,050 --> 01:07:28,230
Okay.

1842
01:07:29,270 --> 01:07:29,810
Oh my god.

1843
01:07:29,890 --> 01:07:30,110
Okay.

1844
01:07:30,490 --> 01:07:31,290
I grabbed him again.

1845
01:07:32,110 --> 01:07:33,150
That's fucking right.

1846
01:07:33,750 --> 01:07:34,430
Get grabbed.

1847
01:07:34,870 --> 01:07:35,350
Get grabbed.

1848
01:07:35,370 --> 01:07:37,090
Come on.

1849
01:07:37,090 --> 01:07:37,990
I'll just keep grabbing.

1850
01:07:38,090 --> 01:07:38,990
Come on!

1851
01:07:38,990 --> 01:07:39,770
Come on, King!

1852
01:07:40,190 --> 01:07:41,470
Just keep grabbing!

1853
01:07:41,730 --> 01:07:42,110
Yes!

1854
01:07:42,410 --> 01:07:43,550
Keep grabbing!

1855
01:07:45,590 --> 01:07:46,850
Oh shit!

1856
01:07:46,950 --> 01:07:48,010
Oh shit!

1857
01:07:48,110 --> 01:07:48,350
No!

1858
01:07:49,310 --> 01:07:50,070
No!

1859
01:07:50,410 --> 01:07:51,870
Just grab him back!

1860
01:07:54,550 --> 01:07:55,610
Oh god!

1861
01:07:55,890 --> 01:07:57,030
Oh no!

1862
01:07:57,410 --> 01:07:58,610
Steve, no!

1863
01:07:59,230 --> 01:08:00,210
Oh god!

1864
01:08:00,290 --> 01:08:00,850
Oh god!

1865
01:08:00,870 --> 01:08:01,250
Just...

1866
01:08:01,250 --> 01:08:01,650
No!

1867
01:08:03,870 --> 01:08:05,110
I got...

1868
01:08:05,390 --> 01:08:07,690
I got out-grabbed!

1869
01:08:08,630 --> 01:08:10,430
I got out-grabbed!

1870
01:08:10,430 --> 01:08:10,770
Oh!

1871
01:08:12,490 --> 01:08:13,310
Oh god.

1872
01:08:13,450 --> 01:08:13,670
Okay.

1873
01:08:14,030 --> 01:08:14,830
That's fine.

1874
01:08:14,990 --> 01:08:15,490
That's fine.

1875
01:08:15,630 --> 01:08:16,590
It's my turn.

1876
01:08:16,790 --> 01:08:17,690
That's fucking right.

1877
01:08:17,750 --> 01:08:18,490
It's my turn.

1878
01:08:19,210 --> 01:08:20,550
That's fucking right.

1879
01:08:21,390 --> 01:08:22,390
Oh shit!

1880
01:08:23,250 --> 01:08:23,890
No!

1881
01:08:25,150 --> 01:08:26,470
Steve, have mercy!

1882
01:08:27,830 --> 01:08:29,210
Steve, have mercy!

1883
01:08:29,210 --> 01:08:30,870
Let me grab you!

1884
01:08:32,610 --> 01:08:33,310
Come on.

1885
01:08:33,390 --> 01:08:33,850
Come on.

1886
01:08:33,870 --> 01:08:34,350
Let me grab you.

1887
01:08:34,370 --> 01:08:34,730
Come on!

1888
01:08:35,150 --> 01:08:36,750
I just need one grab!

1889
01:08:37,170 --> 01:08:38,570
I literally just...

1890
01:08:39,210 --> 01:08:40,210
Oh my god!

1891
01:08:40,210 --> 01:08:43,990
Oh my god!

1892
01:08:44,050 --> 01:08:44,210
Oh my god!

1893
01:08:44,210 --> 01:08:44,790
He's so good!

1894
01:08:45,350 --> 01:08:46,970
Steve is so good!

1895
01:08:48,370 --> 01:08:49,550
Holy shit!

1896
01:08:49,950 --> 01:08:51,530
I'm getting out-catted!

1897
01:08:52,770 --> 01:08:54,030
Oh my god!

1898
01:08:54,210 --> 01:08:55,570
Oh my god!

1899
01:08:55,570 --> 01:08:57,070
He perfectly...

1900
01:08:57,810 --> 01:08:58,690
Oh Steve!

1901
01:08:59,650 --> 01:09:00,870
My skill wall!

1902
01:09:01,130 --> 01:09:03,070
There's no way there's gonna be a newbie!

1903
01:09:03,350 --> 01:09:06,150
There's no way there's gonna be a newbie that's just as good as Steve!

1904
01:09:06,470 --> 01:09:07,250
I refuse!

1905
01:09:08,470 --> 01:09:09,350
I really...

1906
01:09:11,010 --> 01:09:11,930
There's no way!

1907
01:09:12,450 --> 01:09:14,090
I refuse to believe that!

1908
01:09:15,610 --> 01:09:16,050
Okay.

1909
01:09:16,050 --> 01:09:16,630
It's okay.

1910
01:09:17,070 --> 01:09:20,190
We might not be able to grab him as well as...

1911
01:09:20,890 --> 01:09:21,710
Oh my god!

1912
01:09:21,730 --> 01:09:22,330
What the fuck?

1913
01:09:22,750 --> 01:09:23,190
Okay.

1914
01:09:23,250 --> 01:09:23,470
No.

1915
01:09:23,590 --> 01:09:24,650
Please stop doing that.

1916
01:09:24,690 --> 01:09:25,010
Please.

1917
01:09:25,310 --> 01:09:25,750
Please.

1918
01:09:26,030 --> 01:09:27,050
Don't make me use it.

1919
01:09:27,070 --> 01:09:27,410
This...

1920
01:09:31,010 --> 01:09:31,650
Okay.

1921
01:09:33,770 --> 01:09:34,630
I blocked.

1922
01:09:34,850 --> 01:09:35,550
My turn.

1923
01:09:36,130 --> 01:09:36,890
That's right.

1924
01:09:38,210 --> 01:09:39,450
That's fucking right!

1925
01:09:40,090 --> 01:09:40,730
Yes!

1926
01:09:41,550 --> 01:09:42,370
Oh god.

1927
01:09:43,250 --> 01:09:43,650
Okay.

1928
01:09:45,470 --> 01:09:46,530
Grabbing the- No!

1929
01:09:47,790 --> 01:09:49,210
No, it's over for you.

1930
01:09:49,350 --> 01:09:50,470
That's fucking right.

1931
01:09:50,830 --> 01:09:51,690
Oh god.

1932
01:09:51,810 --> 01:09:52,730
He blocked it.

1933
01:09:52,970 --> 01:09:53,590
Yeah!

1934
01:09:53,650 --> 01:09:54,610
You did block shit!

1935
01:09:55,170 --> 01:09:56,450
That's fucking right!

1936
01:09:58,050 --> 01:09:59,210
I figured it out.

1937
01:09:59,750 --> 01:10:00,510
I'm learning.

1938
01:10:00,630 --> 01:10:01,950
I blocked and then grabbed.

1939
01:10:02,570 --> 01:10:03,450
Here we go.

1940
01:10:04,190 --> 01:10:05,670
Just you wait and see.

1941
01:10:06,150 --> 01:10:06,630
Wait.

1942
01:10:06,670 --> 01:10:07,550
I think I do it!

1943
01:10:10,190 --> 01:10:11,150
There's no way!

1944
01:10:11,950 --> 01:10:16,290
There's no way the other noobs can learn how to counter a block- a grab.

1945
01:10:22,930 --> 01:10:23,930
There's no way!

1946
01:10:23,930 --> 01:10:25,710
How would they learn?

1947
01:10:33,370 --> 01:10:34,390
They will.

1948
01:10:34,550 --> 01:10:35,410
There's no way.

1949
01:10:36,110 --> 01:10:39,530
They'll never figure out- They'll never figure out via grab main.

1950
01:10:40,870 --> 01:10:41,790
That's the spirit.

1951
01:10:41,910 --> 01:10:43,970
Come at me again after all you've got.

1952
01:10:44,490 --> 01:10:46,190
I need to learn the chain grab.

1953
01:10:46,450 --> 01:10:47,270
Oh my god.

1954
01:10:47,270 --> 01:10:48,290
I'll be unstoppable!

1955
01:10:48,990 --> 01:10:49,770
Oh my god.

1956
01:10:49,770 --> 01:10:49,850
I'll be unstoppable!

1957
01:10:49,850 --> 01:10:50,250
Oh my god.

1958
01:10:50,830 --> 01:10:51,490
I'll be unstoppable!

1959
01:10:56,710 --> 01:10:57,110
Exactly.

1960
01:10:57,210 --> 01:10:57,930
I don't need to be good.

1961
01:10:57,990 --> 01:10:59,530
I just need to suck less than everyone else.

1962
01:11:01,830 --> 01:11:04,290
If only they had coaches to teach them then they could learn.

1963
01:11:04,350 --> 01:11:04,950
They'll never know!

1964
01:11:05,070 --> 01:11:14,410
They'll never expect me to be the- I'll practice king off stream and I'll play every other- I'll play all the other Tekken characters so they'll never know who my main is.

1965
01:11:14,610 --> 01:11:17,830
And I'll like hard grind king and all I do is just grab.

1966
01:11:18,630 --> 01:11:19,030
.

1967
01:11:23,590 --> 01:11:23,990
.

1968
01:11:23,990 --> 01:11:25,730
Surely they won't research my first stream.

1969
01:11:26,430 --> 01:11:27,670
Surely they wouldn't!

1970
01:11:30,010 --> 01:11:30,670
Yeah, okay.

1971
01:11:30,750 --> 01:11:34,090
We need to get the chain grab going and a lot of people can't counter it.

1972
01:11:35,210 --> 01:11:36,950
Before this gets tough.

1973
01:11:37,530 --> 01:11:41,910
I'll play every other character but king in the next couple of streams.

1974
01:11:42,270 --> 01:11:44,990
And then I'll hard grind and then they'll be like Oh my god.

1975
01:11:45,370 --> 01:11:45,810
Surely.

1976
01:11:46,070 --> 01:11:48,370
Doki Bird is like an eddy main.

1977
01:11:48,530 --> 01:11:56,430
So all we have to do is learn how to count- All you have to do newbies is to learn how to counter like the- Okay, but what if the other people play king?

1978
01:11:56,770 --> 01:11:57,250
Wait.

1979
01:11:57,430 --> 01:12:01,550
How am I gonna like- Oh my god!

1980
01:12:01,610 --> 01:12:05,590
I got the beast and like Oh my god I got player customization!

1981
01:12:06,070 --> 01:12:07,130
They'll never know.

1982
01:12:07,430 --> 01:12:09,370
They'll never know I'm a king main.

1983
01:12:12,310 --> 01:12:15,970
How would they know I'm a king main?

1984
01:12:16,610 --> 01:12:18,050
Oh wait, hey that's my avatar.

1985
01:12:18,290 --> 01:12:19,810
Wait, how do I- player customization?

1986
01:12:20,470 --> 01:12:23,370
Which one is- Use outfit- Oh here you go.

1987
01:12:23,390 --> 01:12:23,850
My title.

1988
01:12:23,990 --> 01:12:26,270
How would they know I'm a king main?

1989
01:12:27,130 --> 01:12:29,170
How would they know I'm a king main?

1990
01:12:32,450 --> 01:12:36,410
Will you and your players health gauge change the design of your player information?

1991
01:12:36,950 --> 01:12:38,690
Is that a magic mirror?

1992
01:12:39,250 --> 01:12:40,630
How would they know?

1993
01:12:41,250 --> 01:12:41,970
Let's see.

1994
01:12:42,110 --> 01:12:44,530
Where is- Where's the beast?

1995
01:12:45,330 --> 01:12:47,210
Wait, I got the title plate, right?

1996
01:12:47,770 --> 01:12:49,770
Where's the- Which one was it?

1997
01:12:49,870 --> 01:12:50,490
Is it this one?

1998
01:12:50,490 --> 01:12:50,710
Which one?

1999
01:12:51,230 --> 01:12:52,490
Which one was the one I unlocked?

2000
01:12:53,190 --> 01:12:54,170
Wait, that's so cute.

2001
01:12:56,270 --> 01:12:58,030
Was it legend plate?

2002
01:12:58,590 --> 01:12:59,970
Tekken emperor plate?

2003
01:13:00,510 --> 01:13:02,170
Which one was the one that I unlocked?

2004
01:13:02,330 --> 01:13:02,790
Guys.

2005
01:13:06,750 --> 01:13:07,210
Title?

2006
01:13:07,370 --> 01:13:09,010
Yeah, I know but which one is it called?

2007
01:13:13,580 --> 01:13:15,660
That's- Which one is it called guys?

2008
01:13:15,820 --> 01:13:16,420
I don't remember.

2009
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:18,240
I unlocked it but I don't remember.

2010
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:20,620
For down below the locked ones- Oh!

2011
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:22,360
Wait no, these are paid.

2012
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:23,780
I have to buy these.

2013
01:13:24,460 --> 01:13:25,000
Liars.

2014
01:13:26,020 --> 01:13:27,460
What is the one that I unlocked?

2015
01:13:29,140 --> 01:13:30,160
Oh, there it is.

2016
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:31,580
How would they know?

2017
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:35,620
Guys.

2018
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:40,560
How would they know I'm a king main?

2019
01:13:40,780 --> 01:13:42,060
There's no way.

2020
01:13:44,820 --> 01:13:47,440
There's no fucking way they could find out.

2021
01:13:47,780 --> 01:13:49,600
There's no way.

2022
01:13:52,900 --> 01:13:54,580
Dude, he is all I need.

2023
01:13:54,700 --> 01:13:55,360
Wait, that's great.

2024
01:13:55,820 --> 01:13:57,560
Where's the one I unlocked for this?

2025
01:13:58,420 --> 01:14:00,020
Is it the play information panel?

2026
01:14:01,160 --> 01:14:02,440
You missed the beast.

2027
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:03,440
Where is the beast?

2028
01:14:04,920 --> 01:14:05,820
Today's the day.

2029
01:14:06,020 --> 01:14:06,900
Where's the beast?

2030
01:14:07,380 --> 01:14:08,660
I can't find it.

2031
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:09,640
I found tea drink.

2032
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:13,300
Where the fuck is the beast?

2033
01:14:16,460 --> 01:14:16,900
Down?

2034
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:17,760
It's further down?

2035
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:19,160
Yeah, but these are all locked.

2036
01:14:20,380 --> 01:14:21,320
Where's the unlocked?

2037
01:14:21,480 --> 01:14:22,220
Oh, there it is.

2038
01:14:23,480 --> 01:14:24,320
That beast.

2039
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:25,200
There we go.

2040
01:14:26,140 --> 01:14:27,220
They'll never know.

2041
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:29,680
Guys, they'll never know I'm a king main.

2042
01:14:34,240 --> 01:14:35,480
They'll never know.

2043
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:39,520
They'll never know.

2044
01:14:39,580 --> 01:14:40,400
How could they?

2045
01:14:42,200 --> 01:14:45,900
If they found out I'm the king main...

2046
01:14:45,900 --> 01:14:47,580
They're fucking stream snipers.

2047
01:14:47,580 --> 01:14:49,660
They'll keep it going.

2048
01:14:51,780 --> 01:14:53,000
They'll never know.

2049
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:55,340
Save and exit.

2050
01:14:55,580 --> 01:14:56,420
There we go.

2051
01:14:57,100 --> 01:15:00,360
I'm sure they're 8 minute king guys.

2052
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:01,920
There's no way.

2053
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:04,240
I refuse to believe they'll find out.

2054
01:15:04,380 --> 01:15:06,080
If they find out they're hackers.

2055
01:15:07,560 --> 01:15:09,480
How would they know?

2056
01:15:09,660 --> 01:15:10,300
Exactly.

2057
01:15:10,760 --> 01:15:12,460
You know what?

2058
01:15:12,540 --> 01:15:12,960
I'm ready.

2059
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:15,300
I'm fucking ready.

2060
01:15:19,980 --> 01:15:21,900
I'm so ready.

2061
01:15:24,980 --> 01:15:25,660
I'm so ready.

2062
01:15:25,660 --> 01:15:25,680
I'm so ready.

2063
01:15:25,680 --> 01:15:27,060
Not a king main.

2064
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:29,140
I'm so ready.

2065
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:29,960
This is it.

2066
01:15:31,100 --> 01:15:31,440
There.

2067
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:33,560
Okay.

2068
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:36,380
We'll do...

2069
01:15:37,160 --> 01:15:38,340
Max number of participants.

2070
01:15:38,840 --> 01:15:39,440
Wait.

2071
01:15:40,020 --> 01:15:40,700
Actually...

2072
01:15:41,240 --> 01:15:41,740
Fuck it.

2073
01:15:41,860 --> 01:15:42,580
We'll do...

2074
01:15:42,580 --> 01:15:43,260
There we go.

2075
01:15:43,640 --> 01:15:44,320
Alright.

2076
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:45,220
There's no way.

2077
01:15:45,300 --> 01:15:46,600
They won't know.

2078
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:50,800
Guys.

2079
01:15:51,040 --> 01:15:52,120
How would they know?

2080
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:55,100
How could they possibly know?

2081
01:15:55,420 --> 01:15:56,780
The mind games?

2082
01:16:01,220 --> 01:16:03,560
That she really must not be a king main.

2083
01:16:03,700 --> 01:16:04,020
I'm not.

2084
01:16:04,180 --> 01:16:05,360
Who said I was?

2085
01:16:05,540 --> 01:16:06,320
I told you.

2086
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:09,400
My server... My session...

2087
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:10,760
says not a king main.

2088
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:12,040
So how would they know?

2089
01:16:12,680 --> 01:16:13,480
Just saying.

2090
01:16:17,240 --> 01:16:17,760
No.

2091
01:16:17,880 --> 01:16:18,800
Just don't play...

2092
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:19,060
Okay.

2093
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:20,080
But how do I...

2094
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:20,440
Wait.

2095
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:22,720
How do I counter another king player?

2096
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:24,140
It's so easy.

2097
01:16:24,260 --> 01:16:25,960
I'll grab them before they grab me.

2098
01:16:26,220 --> 01:16:26,740
Chat.

2099
01:16:26,980 --> 01:16:29,740
I'll grab the king player before they grab me.

2100
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:31,000
And then it'll be GG's.

2101
01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:32,980
It'll be GG's from there.

2102
01:16:34,680 --> 01:16:36,540
It's hard to get a read on...

2103
01:16:37,780 --> 01:16:38,820
Quick guys!

2104
01:16:39,100 --> 01:16:40,620
Come in before... Guys!

2105
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:41,440
Start.

2106
01:16:41,580 --> 01:16:42,100
Hurry up.

2111
01:16:45,300 --> 01:16:47,880
The online servers are going down in 2 minutes.

2112
01:16:48,160 --> 01:16:48,700
Hurry.

2114

Wow.

2116
01:16:57,080 --> 01:16:58,160
You're so smart.

2117
01:16:58,500 --> 01:17:00,600
Grab them first before they grab me.

2118
01:17:00,900 --> 01:17:01,460
Exactly.

2119
01:17:01,860 --> 01:17:02,700
I'm going left side.

2120
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:03,840
Where's king?

2121
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:06,740
Oh nice.

2122
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:07,380
There you go.

2123
01:17:08,240 --> 01:17:09,240
They'll never know.

2124
01:17:09,540 --> 01:17:11,180
I bet they don't know which one I picked.

2125
01:17:12,900 --> 01:17:13,460
Hurry!

2126
01:17:13,740 --> 01:17:14,560
Hurry up!

2127
01:17:15,300 --> 01:17:15,680
We need to dance.

2128
01:17:17,220 --> 01:17:18,800
We got to start.

2129
01:17:19,940 --> 01:17:20,660
It's okay.

2130
01:17:21,180 --> 01:17:22,400
I learned this.

2131
01:17:23,300 --> 01:17:23,900
Guys.

2132
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:25,500
I've learned how to play.

2133
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:29,660
They couldn't pause.

2134
01:17:29,980 --> 01:17:31,420
I bet they didn't expect it.

2135
01:17:35,140 --> 01:17:36,340
I bet...

2136
01:17:36,340 --> 01:17:38,600
Guys, I bet they didn't expect this.

2137
01:17:42,540 --> 01:17:43,680
There's no way.

2138
01:17:44,580 --> 01:17:45,180
Okay.

2139
01:17:45,660 --> 01:17:46,540
Oh yeah.

2140
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:50,480
That's like a go- OH SHIT HE CATTERED MY GRUB AND NOW I'M LAYING!

2141
01:17:51,320 --> 01:17:53,520
OHHHHH HOW DID YOU KNOW?!

2142
01:17:55,720 --> 01:17:57,140
Oh my god!

2143
01:17:57,240 --> 01:17:59,220
How did she know?!

2144
01:17:59,220 --> 01:18:01,480
How- oh my god.

2145
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:04,380
Guys, how the fuck did she know?!

2146
01:18:04,380 --> 01:18:06,680
I'm so sorry!

2147
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:11,080
I don't- I don't understand!

2148
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:15,040
How did she know?!

2149
01:18:17,220 --> 01:18:18,320
That's fucking right!

2150
01:18:18,540 --> 01:18:20,620
Yeah, counter this bitch!

2151
01:18:20,840 --> 01:18:22,360
That's fucking right!

2152
01:18:22,460 --> 01:18:24,160
You can't counter shit!

2153
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:29,520
Oh god.

2154
01:18:29,960 --> 01:18:30,720
Oh god.

2155
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:31,660
It's fine.

2156
01:18:31,800 --> 01:18:32,640
I got one in.

2157
01:18:33,560 --> 01:18:34,360
It's okay.

2158
01:18:34,740 --> 01:18:35,780
I got it.

2159
01:18:35,820 --> 01:18:36,740
OH MY GOD!

2160
01:18:36,840 --> 01:18:38,540
SHE'S COUNTERING MY G- EVERYTHING!

2161
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:43,760
No way!

2162
01:18:46,020 --> 01:18:48,480
You can counter grabs?!

2163
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:51,200
WHY?!

2164
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:53,500
That's fucking right.

2165
01:18:53,560 --> 01:18:54,680
Counter this bitch!

2166
01:18:58,620 --> 01:18:59,380
It's okay.

2167
01:18:59,480 --> 01:19:00,120
I got my one.

2168
01:19:00,300 --> 01:19:01,860
I got my one grab.

2169
01:19:02,040 --> 01:19:02,900
That's all that matters.

2170
01:19:04,980 --> 01:19:06,540
That's fucking right.

2171
01:19:07,320 --> 01:19:09,020
That's fucking right!

2172
01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:12,740
Get K.O'd!

2173
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:13,640
I learned!

2174
01:19:13,720 --> 01:19:13,740
I learned!

2175
01:19:15,320 --> 01:19:16,360
I adapted!

2176
01:19:17,720 --> 01:19:19,240
Oh, you wanted grab too!

2177
01:19:20,100 --> 01:19:20,620
Yeah?

2178
01:19:21,940 --> 01:19:22,860
Oh my god!

2179
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:23,700
She grabbed me!

2180
01:19:24,060 --> 01:19:25,560
How's that possible?!

2181
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:27,240
Oh, she countered my grab!

2182
01:19:27,540 --> 01:19:29,080
How is that possible?!

2183
01:19:29,080 --> 01:19:29,640
Oh yeah?

2184
01:19:29,980 --> 01:19:33,260
I bet your whole idea is to counter all these grabs.

2185
01:19:33,540 --> 01:19:34,780
Oh my god.

2186
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:35,220
Okay.

2187
01:19:35,540 --> 01:19:38,840
That's fucking right, but you didn't- SHE'S COUNTERING MY GRABS!

2188
01:19:42,260 --> 01:19:43,040
Get rekt.

2189
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:43,560
Counter this.

2190
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:44,500
Bitch.

2191
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:47,660
That's icky.

2192
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:48,940
That's icky, right?

2193
01:19:49,400 --> 01:19:51,960
You fucking didn't counter all of these, did ya?

2194
01:19:52,280 --> 01:19:53,740
That's icky, right?!

2195
01:19:53,740 --> 01:19:54,960
You didn't counter this!

2196
01:19:55,080 --> 01:19:56,080
I got one off you!

2197
01:19:57,580 --> 01:20:01,020
I have zero Tekken experience, but I took a round.

2198
01:20:01,180 --> 01:20:02,640
I took a round off her.

2199
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:04,480
She knows how to Tekken.

2200
01:20:10,460 --> 01:20:13,540
What's embarrassing is that she- I took a round off her.

2201
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:15,780
That's the embarrassing run.

2202
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:21,960
That's right.

2203
01:20:22,300 --> 01:20:24,980
I got- She couldn't counter that!

2204
01:20:25,380 --> 01:20:26,980
I cleaned shit.

2205
01:20:27,740 --> 01:20:30,240
No one can deflect this.

2206
01:20:30,760 --> 01:20:31,600
Nooooo!

2207
01:20:33,580 --> 01:20:34,420
Nooooo!

2208
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:37,060
Alright, we'll do one- We'll do a story mode.

2209
01:20:37,640 --> 01:20:38,860
RIP online.

2210
01:20:40,500 --> 01:20:49,420
Just remember, the zero- The zero- The zero Tekken experience Doki Bird took a round off you by just spamming grab.

2211
01:20:50,580 --> 01:20:52,160
Let me in.

2212
01:20:56,340 --> 01:20:59,940
It's more embarrassing for you than it is for me to lose.

2213
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:01,540
Cause it's expected.

2214
01:21:01,820 --> 01:21:05,160
But it was not expected for me to take a round off you.

2215
01:21:09,680 --> 01:21:10,720
I'm impressed.

2216
01:21:11,240 --> 01:21:12,220
Alright, nice.

2217
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:13,320
Can I keep playing?

2218
01:21:13,560 --> 01:21:13,820
I'm a king.

2219
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:16,540
I got the round one.

2220
01:21:16,780 --> 01:21:17,780
I have nothing- Exactly.

2221
01:21:18,060 --> 01:21:19,200
I have nothing to lose.

2222
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:21,160
I have the moral victory.

2223
01:21:22,860 --> 01:21:25,140
My ego can only go higher.

2224
01:21:25,340 --> 01:21:27,020
Cause I start at rock bottom.

2225
01:21:29,080 --> 01:21:30,660
Not a king, man.

2226
01:21:37,820 --> 01:21:39,920
I don't play king in this mode?

2227
01:21:40,620 --> 01:21:41,200
What?

2228
01:21:41,860 --> 01:21:43,280
How can I exist?

2229
01:21:44,420 --> 01:21:45,580
Without king?

2230
01:21:52,420 --> 01:21:53,680
I play gym?

2231
01:21:54,180 --> 01:21:55,000
What the fuck?

2232
01:21:55,300 --> 01:21:56,900
I'm sorry for all the gyms out there.

2233
01:21:56,940 --> 01:22:00,720
What kind of fucking fighting character name is gym?

2234
01:22:01,260 --> 01:22:02,000
What kind of fucking fighting character name is gym?

2235
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,480
I'm fucking playing the office guy?

2236
01:22:04,700 --> 01:22:06,140
I'm gym mode.

2237
01:22:06,360 --> 01:22:08,200
I'm stuck with emo gym.

2238
01:22:08,580 --> 01:22:09,900
I'm playing the office.

2239
01:22:16,970 --> 01:22:17,850
Oh, Jin!

2240
01:22:18,090 --> 01:22:19,430
I thought you guys said gym.

2241
01:22:19,890 --> 01:22:21,770
I was like- Sorry.

2242
01:22:21,890 --> 01:22:22,970
Gym Tekken.

2243
01:22:23,090 --> 01:22:23,510
Sorry.

2244
01:22:23,590 --> 01:22:23,930
Jin.

2245
01:22:25,650 --> 01:22:27,150
It's Jin map.

2246
01:22:27,690 --> 01:22:29,790
I thought you guys- Sorry.

2247
01:22:29,910 --> 01:22:30,530
I can't read.

2248
01:22:30,650 --> 01:22:32,830
I thought it meant- I thought you guys said gym.

2249
01:22:34,830 --> 01:22:36,270
Okay, that's pretty badass.

2250
01:22:38,750 --> 01:22:40,550
I was like, why is his name Jim?

2251
01:22:40,970 --> 01:22:42,650
But his actual name is Jin.

2252
01:22:45,990 --> 01:22:48,350
No, his name is Jin now.

2253
01:22:50,870 --> 01:22:51,550
Mishima.

2254
01:22:54,290 --> 01:22:55,950
That his name?

2255
01:23:12,390 --> 01:23:14,050
I wish I was king.

2256
01:23:14,250 --> 01:23:15,790
I miss king, guys.

2257
01:23:19,850 --> 01:23:21,050
I already miss him.

2258
01:23:26,990 --> 01:23:28,230
Oh, that's a dad?

2259
01:23:30,070 --> 01:23:30,970
Oh shit!

2260
01:23:31,530 --> 01:23:32,510
Can he grab?

2261
01:23:33,870 --> 01:23:34,870
Alright, guys.

2262
01:23:35,310 --> 01:23:35,910
Oh!

2263
01:23:37,850 --> 01:23:38,570
Oh my gosh.

2264
01:23:38,650 --> 01:23:38,930
Okay.

2265
01:23:39,250 --> 01:23:39,890
Okay.

2266
01:23:42,150 --> 01:23:43,210
I'm gonna use this other thing though.

2267
01:23:44,030 --> 01:23:44,830
Can you grab?

2268
01:23:44,930 --> 01:23:45,730
Wait, you can grab!

2269
01:23:46,090 --> 01:23:47,350
Wait, how good is your grab though?

2270
01:23:48,550 --> 01:23:49,030
Okay.

2271
01:23:49,150 --> 01:23:49,670
It's okay.

2272
01:23:50,330 --> 01:23:51,370
I'm just gonna keep grabbing.

2273
01:23:52,730 --> 01:23:53,890
Oh my god.

2274
01:23:53,910 --> 01:23:54,710
It's not the same.

2275
01:23:55,050 --> 01:23:56,770
It's not the same, guys.

2276
01:23:56,970 --> 01:24:02,510
It's not the same.

2277
01:24:02,810 --> 01:24:04,870
His grab is not the same.

2278
01:24:15,060 --> 01:24:16,380
It's not the same as his grab.

2279
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:17,000
It's king though.

2280
01:24:17,240 --> 01:24:18,360
King was cooler!

2281
01:24:19,420 --> 01:24:20,220
Wait, what?

2282
01:24:20,540 --> 01:24:20,980
Dodge.

2283
01:24:21,300 --> 01:24:21,700
Oh, okay.

2284
01:24:24,580 --> 01:24:25,020
Okay.

2285
01:24:25,460 --> 01:24:26,420
Go look down.

2286
01:24:26,520 --> 01:24:27,360
Yeah, that's fucking right.

2287
01:24:28,860 --> 01:24:29,800
That's fucking right.

2288
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:30,980
And then I'll do this again!

2289
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:32,200
Yeah!

2290
01:24:34,680 --> 01:24:35,380
Oh shit!

2291
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:37,600
Okay, I blocked it, I think.

2292
01:24:38,580 --> 01:24:39,260
Yeah, I did!

2293
01:24:40,040 --> 01:24:40,660
I did!

2294
01:24:40,740 --> 01:24:41,260
I blocked it!

2295
01:24:41,400 --> 01:24:41,900
Oh shit!

2296
01:24:42,040 --> 01:24:43,740
No no no no no no no!

2297
01:24:43,740 --> 01:24:46,560
Oh shit he shot me in the fucking gut.

2298
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:48,760
Oh god.

2299
01:24:49,420 --> 01:24:50,060
Nice.

2300
01:24:50,200 --> 01:24:50,500
Alright.

2301
01:24:52,980 --> 01:24:54,760
Okay and then... PLEASE!

2302
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:56,100
GRAB HIM JIN!

2303

GRAB HIM!

2304
01:24:57,980 --> 01:24:58,460
YES!

2305
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:00,300
GRAB HIM AGAIN!

2306
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:01,580
WE'RE KING!

2307
01:25:02,660 --> 01:25:03,920
GRAB HIM AGAIN!

2308
01:25:04,520 --> 01:25:06,040
Guys I can't grab him.

2309
01:25:09,240 --> 01:25:14,940
By the way Doki, all you need to know about this family is that they like to keep throwing each other off really high cliffs.

2310
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:16,600
Gladzo, thank you for the super chat!

2311
01:25:16,760 --> 01:25:17,040
Thank you!

2312
01:25:21,300 --> 01:25:22,600
The worst king.

2313
01:25:28,140 --> 01:25:29,640
This one goes out to king.

2314
01:25:31,080 --> 01:25:31,880
Oh shit!

2315
01:25:31,940 --> 01:25:32,300
Nice!

2316
01:25:34,200 --> 01:25:36,020
Good old fashioned family, Drow.

2317
01:25:49,690 --> 01:25:52,570
I love it when my frames go to 18.

2318
01:25:55,190 --> 01:25:57,030
Woah I have wings now?

2319
01:25:57,810 --> 01:25:58,570
Holy shit!

2320
01:25:58,630 --> 01:25:59,870
How many forms do I have?

2321
01:26:00,150 --> 01:26:01,010
Alright watch this.

2322
01:26:01,070 --> 01:26:01,670
I can block this.

2323
01:26:03,770 --> 01:26:04,330
Guys.

2324
01:26:07,970 --> 01:26:09,410
Guys I can block one.

2325
01:26:09,670 --> 01:26:10,070
Right?

2326
01:26:11,510 --> 01:26:12,410
There's no way.

2327
01:26:12,970 --> 01:26:13,490
Yes!

2328
01:26:13,630 --> 01:26:14,590
Okay I got it.

2329
01:26:14,730 --> 01:26:16,230
That was... I count that as a block.

2330
01:26:16,450 --> 01:26:17,530
I count...

2331
01:26:19,270 --> 01:26:21,430
I count that as a block guys.

2332
01:26:22,250 --> 01:26:23,210
Okay here we go.

2333
01:26:24,130 --> 01:26:25,210
Okay did I block that?

2334
01:26:25,410 --> 01:26:26,510
That... no I didn't.

2335
01:26:26,690 --> 01:26:29,750
No I didn't.

2336
01:26:30,050 --> 01:26:31,110
Holy shit!

2337
01:26:31,790 --> 01:26:33,870
Guys it's cause I gave him one!

2338
01:26:35,050 --> 01:26:37,010
Holy shit my laser eyes.

2339
01:26:37,670 --> 01:26:38,350
That's insane.

2340
01:26:39,710 --> 01:26:40,510
Oh nope.

2341
01:26:41,890 --> 01:26:43,370
How am I doing worse?

2342
01:26:45,010 --> 01:26:46,690
Oh I think that was a block.

2343
01:26:47,210 --> 01:26:48,510
I think I actually did that.

2344
01:26:50,450 --> 01:26:51,150
Oh god.

2345
01:26:51,230 --> 01:26:51,870
Oh god.

2346
01:26:51,970 --> 01:26:52,130
Okay.

2347
01:26:52,610 --> 01:26:53,650
No no no no no no.

2348
01:26:54,530 --> 01:26:54,930
Nice.

2349
01:26:56,110 --> 01:26:56,690
That's fine.

2350
01:26:56,750 --> 01:26:57,030
That's fine.

2351
01:26:57,070 --> 01:26:57,490
That's fine.

2352
01:26:57,830 --> 01:26:58,450
That's fine.

2353
01:26:59,590 --> 01:26:59,990
Okay.

2354
01:27:00,390 --> 01:27:01,590
No no no no no no.

2355
01:27:01,890 --> 01:27:02,290
Yes!

2356
01:27:02,570 --> 01:27:02,970
Blocked!

2357
01:27:03,710 --> 01:27:04,670
That's fucking right!

2358
01:27:07,410 --> 01:27:08,070
Oh no.

2359
01:27:08,150 --> 01:27:09,070
That's not okay.

2360
01:27:09,990 --> 01:27:10,970
That's not okay.

2361
01:27:11,170 --> 01:27:11,490
No!

2362
01:27:11,710 --> 01:27:12,810
I tried to fly!

2363
01:27:12,970 --> 01:27:13,930
Why did I try to fly?

2364
01:27:14,090 --> 01:27:14,510
No!

2365
01:27:15,750 --> 01:27:16,450
Oh wait.

2366
01:27:16,950 --> 01:27:17,430
Nice.

2367
01:27:18,390 --> 01:27:18,870
Nice.

2368
01:27:18,950 --> 01:27:19,970
The game protected me.

2369
01:27:20,590 --> 01:27:21,290
I blocked.

2370
01:27:26,040 --> 01:27:26,860
That's right guys.

2371
01:27:26,980 --> 01:27:27,300
I blocked.

2372
01:27:31,860 --> 01:27:32,820
Story mochis.

2373
01:27:33,440 --> 01:27:34,760
Guys what are you talking about?

2374
01:27:35,060 --> 01:27:35,780
I lived.

2375
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:38,700
I lived.

2376
01:27:38,700 --> 01:27:39,020
I lived guys.

2377
01:27:39,400 --> 01:27:40,440
I don't know what you're talking about.

2378
01:27:42,980 --> 01:27:44,320
Is this devil mode?

2379
01:27:44,460 --> 01:27:45,720
I guess because he has like black wings.

2380
01:27:46,900 --> 01:27:48,200
Am I gonna kill my dad?

2381
01:27:49,160 --> 01:27:50,340
This is not Clift.

2382
01:27:51,420 --> 01:27:52,340
Oh shit.

2383
01:27:53,620 --> 01:27:55,900
I love watching this in like 30 FPS.

2384
01:28:05,420 --> 01:28:06,720
Guys I perfected.

2385
01:28:06,820 --> 01:28:08,560
Because I had full HP when I...

2386
01:28:08,560 --> 01:28:10,660
I had full HP when I ended.

2387
01:28:11,560 --> 01:28:12,480
What the fuck?

2388
01:28:12,600 --> 01:28:13,960
Is he also a devil?

2389
01:28:16,520 --> 01:28:17,160
Woah.

2390
01:28:18,180 --> 01:28:18,380
Woah.

2391
01:28:21,720 --> 01:28:24,780
What do I do?

2392
01:28:28,170 --> 01:28:29,070
Oh my god.

2393
01:28:29,090 --> 01:28:29,770
My lasers.

2394
01:28:31,450 --> 01:28:32,090
Okay.

2395
01:28:32,270 --> 01:28:32,970
I'm gonna block.

2396
01:28:35,770 --> 01:28:36,410
Okay.

2397
01:28:37,170 --> 01:28:38,010
Oh shit!

2398
01:28:38,690 --> 01:28:40,390
How was I supposed to know he's a...

2399
01:28:40,390 --> 01:28:40,830
What?

2400
01:28:43,070 --> 01:28:44,310
What the fuck?

2401
01:28:44,310 --> 01:28:48,700
What is this?

2402
01:28:48,780 --> 01:28:49,540
Oh it's okay.

2403
01:28:49,620 --> 01:28:50,040
I grabbed.

2404
01:28:50,300 --> 01:28:51,400
And he counted my grab?

2405
01:28:53,020 --> 01:28:54,100
Guys this is bad.

2406
01:28:54,300 --> 01:28:57,040
The CPU is learning.

2407
01:28:57,780 --> 01:28:58,300
You're...

2408
01:28:59,240 --> 01:28:59,800
That's right.

2409
01:28:59,940 --> 01:29:00,860
I blocked low.

2410
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:01,880
But I'll block high now.

2411
01:29:02,200 --> 01:29:02,600
No!

2412
01:29:03,780 --> 01:29:04,860
Oh my god.

2413
01:29:04,960 --> 01:29:05,920
Why is he so...

2414
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:09,000
Guys it's because I'm not king.

2415
01:29:09,380 --> 01:29:11,160
I can't do this without king.

2416
01:29:11,700 --> 01:29:13,320
He was my crutch.

2417
01:29:16,460 --> 01:29:19,560
He was my fucking crutch.

2418
01:29:19,740 --> 01:29:21,300
He was my fucking crutch.

2419
01:29:21,300 --> 01:29:21,400
He was my fucking crutch.

2420
01:29:22,220 --> 01:29:23,480
He was my fucking crutch.

2421
01:29:24,500 --> 01:29:26,120
What the fuck?

2422
01:29:29,360 --> 01:29:30,800
Oh my god.

2423
01:29:31,220 --> 01:29:31,980
Oh my god.

2424
01:29:33,320 --> 01:29:34,820
Oh my god.

2425
01:29:34,920 --> 01:29:35,860
He's so good.

2426
01:29:37,160 --> 01:29:38,260
I'm trying.

2427
01:29:38,440 --> 01:29:41,520
I need to stop grabbing because it's all I know.

2428
01:29:44,340 --> 01:29:46,000
It's actually all I know.

2429
01:29:47,020 --> 01:29:48,720
I'm so used to grabbing.

2430
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:51,220
It's just pure instinct.

2431
01:29:53,380 --> 01:29:55,500
It's actually pure instinct.

2432
01:29:55,580 --> 01:29:56,320
My grabs.

2433
01:29:57,840 --> 01:29:59,660
I've been doing it so much.

2434
01:30:00,680 --> 01:30:01,280
Okay.

2435
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:02,200
Nice.

2436
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:03,300
I blocked this.

2437
01:30:03,680 --> 01:30:03,820
Oh!

2438
01:30:04,440 --> 01:30:05,980
He did though.

2439
01:30:07,240 --> 01:30:08,140
Oh god.

2440
01:30:09,260 --> 01:30:09,860
Oh.

2441
01:30:09,860 --> 01:30:10,600
It's okay.

2442
01:30:11,140 --> 01:30:12,680
Oh god it's not okay.

2443
01:30:12,760 --> 01:30:13,300
Oh god.

2444
01:30:13,300 --> 01:30:13,300
It's not okay.

2445
01:30:13,320 --> 01:30:14,960
Oh god.

2446
01:30:15,360 --> 01:30:17,460
It's like fucking all the time.

2447
01:30:18,180 --> 01:30:18,900
Oh.

2448
01:30:18,980 --> 01:30:19,700
Oh!

2449
01:30:20,260 --> 01:30:21,800
Why is he so good?

2450
01:30:25,040 --> 01:30:27,960
How is the AI learning so much from me?

2451
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:32,300
How is the AI learning so much from me?

2452
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:34,260
It's actually insane.

2453
01:30:35,200 --> 01:30:37,800
The AI learned so much.

2454
01:30:40,820 --> 01:30:42,140
He regained Jace?

2455
01:30:42,860 --> 01:30:43,720
This is bullshit.

2456
01:30:45,140 --> 01:30:45,740
There you go.

2457
01:30:45,800 --> 01:30:46,460
I got grabbed him.

2458
01:30:47,220 --> 01:30:47,940
Oh my god.

2459
01:30:47,980 --> 01:30:48,860
I need to stop grabbing.

2460
01:30:49,060 --> 01:30:50,300
I need to stop grabbing.

2461
01:30:50,520 --> 01:30:51,540
It's all I know.

2462
01:30:52,260 --> 01:30:54,500
It's actually all I know.

2463
01:30:55,900 --> 01:30:57,520
Doki they are unblockable in this game.

2464
01:30:57,600 --> 01:30:58,780
Anyway, good luck in learning the game.

2465
01:30:58,880 --> 01:31:00,520
Thank you for the first super chat.

2466
01:31:01,740 --> 01:31:02,620
Thank you.

2467
01:31:03,220 --> 01:31:04,160
Oh my god.

2468
01:31:04,220 --> 01:31:04,460
Please.

2469
01:31:04,460 --> 01:31:05,960
Oh my god.

2470
01:31:07,920 --> 01:31:08,880
Holy shit.

2471
01:31:08,980 --> 01:31:10,460
I'm getting absolutely destroyed.

2472
01:31:11,660 --> 01:31:12,140
Oh.

2473
01:31:14,460 --> 01:31:14,940
Guys.

2474
01:31:15,920 --> 01:31:16,780
This is bad.

2475
01:31:19,260 --> 01:31:22,040
I'm actually getting absolutely destroyed there.

2476
01:31:22,240 --> 01:31:22,600
I'm actually getting absolutely destroyed there.

2477
01:31:23,060 --> 01:31:23,540
I'm actually getting absolutely destroyed there.

2478
01:31:23,960 --> 01:31:24,440
Okay.

2479
01:31:24,760 --> 01:31:25,960
I know how to kick though.

2480
01:31:26,300 --> 01:31:27,280
That's fucking right.

2481
01:31:27,660 --> 01:31:28,300
Oh no.

2482
01:31:28,480 --> 01:31:29,320
That's not good.

2483
01:31:29,400 --> 01:31:29,700
It's okay.

2484
01:31:29,960 --> 01:31:31,320
I still know how to grab.

2485
01:31:32,300 --> 01:31:33,380
This is my legacy.

2486
01:31:35,020 --> 01:31:36,940
My king instinct is taking over.

2487
01:31:39,740 --> 01:31:40,700
My king instinct is taking over.

2488
01:31:40,700 --> 01:31:42,200
Hit him low then high.

2489
01:31:42,340 --> 01:31:42,660
Hit him low then high.

2490
01:31:42,660 --> 01:31:42,660
Okay.

2491
01:31:42,660 --> 01:31:43,300
I got it.

2492
01:31:43,740 --> 01:31:45,380
Hit him low then high.

2493
01:31:46,120 --> 01:31:47,000
Oh my god.

2494
01:31:47,020 --> 01:31:47,680
But he hit back.

2495
01:31:48,240 --> 01:31:49,460
I can't believe it.

2496
01:31:49,480 --> 01:31:51,100
A fighting game and he hits back?

2497
01:31:51,780 --> 01:31:52,480
That's insane.

2498
01:31:53,180 --> 01:31:53,820
That's right.

2499
01:31:53,880 --> 01:31:54,420
I'll grab you.

2500
01:31:54,860 --> 01:31:55,820
That's fucking right.

2501
01:31:56,160 --> 01:31:56,940
Oh shit.

2502
01:31:57,600 --> 01:31:58,080
Nice.

2503
01:31:58,400 --> 01:31:59,020
Come on.

2504
01:31:59,580 --> 01:32:00,060
Yes.

2505
01:32:00,300 --> 01:32:00,960
Come on.

2506
01:32:01,320 --> 01:32:02,220
Oh.

2507
01:32:03,640 --> 01:32:04,380
Yes.

2508
01:32:05,740 --> 01:32:06,880
Hit him low.

2509
01:32:07,540 --> 01:32:07,980
Wait.

2510
01:32:08,040 --> 01:32:08,980
He's still alive?

2511
01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:13,460
I did it.

2512
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:13,980
I learned.

2513
01:32:19,700 --> 01:32:20,820
What's going on?

2514
01:32:22,180 --> 01:32:23,700
What the fuck is going on?

2515
01:32:25,860 --> 01:32:27,320
I broke the crab?

2516
01:32:28,240 --> 01:32:28,980
How?

2517
01:32:29,500 --> 01:32:30,060
Hahaha.

2518
01:32:30,440 --> 01:32:31,040
Hahaha.

2519
01:32:33,880 --> 01:32:35,160
I mean I knew how.

2520
01:32:35,360 --> 01:32:36,060
Of course.

2521
01:32:37,280 --> 01:32:39,020
Of course I know how.

2522
01:32:40,300 --> 01:32:40,780
Hahaha.

2523
01:32:57,750 --> 01:32:59,270
Random, thank you for the super chat.

2524
01:32:59,370 --> 01:32:59,590
Thank you.

2525
01:32:59,710 --> 01:33:00,070
Thank you.

2526
01:33:02,370 --> 01:33:02,850
Whoa.

2527
01:33:10,170 --> 01:33:10,770
It's okay.

2528
01:33:10,870 --> 01:33:11,910
We can rebuild it.

2529
01:33:13,570 --> 01:33:15,030
Why we in New York?

2530
01:33:16,570 --> 01:33:17,450
Why we in New York?

2531
01:33:17,450 --> 01:33:18,110
Shouldn't we be in Japan?

2532
01:33:30,980 --> 01:33:32,080
Why not?

2533
01:33:32,460 --> 01:33:33,040
Why not?

2534
01:33:33,040 --> 01:33:34,680
Oh and he chose New York?

2535
01:33:34,980 --> 01:33:35,780
That's fucked up.

2536
01:33:50,220 --> 01:33:52,780
Just another day in New York.

2537
01:33:58,640 --> 01:34:01,380
Just another day in New York.

2538
01:34:01,380 --> 01:34:03,020
Oh my god, he's speaking in like...

2539
01:34:03,680 --> 01:34:04,240
Wow!

2540
01:34:06,200 --> 01:34:07,880
Hey, they're like universalists.

2541
01:34:07,940 --> 01:34:09,380
Do they all have like...

2542
01:34:10,760 --> 01:34:11,500
It's French!

2543
01:34:11,980 --> 01:34:15,280
Do they all have like earpieces that translate each language they're speaking?

2544
01:34:24,320 --> 01:34:28,400
They would never!

2545
01:34:29,260 --> 01:34:31,260
Yes, but they can't counter my grabs.

2546
01:34:33,640 --> 01:34:34,500
There's no way.

2547
01:34:36,220 --> 01:34:39,920
At best, if they get better, they won't be matching up with me.

2548
01:34:40,080 --> 01:34:41,840
Because as long as I don't improve...

2549
01:34:45,940 --> 01:34:50,900
As long as I don't improve, I'll still be matched up with all the people in my rank.

2550
01:34:53,800 --> 01:34:54,480
The fuck?

2551
01:34:59,340 --> 01:35:00,940
I'll be the one to replace you.

2552
01:35:03,040 --> 01:35:03,520
Yeah,

2553
01:35:09,980 --> 01:35:11,840
but like the thing is they have to...

2554
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:14,060
We're matched up to like our level.

2555
01:35:14,820 --> 01:35:16,240
So I just like...

2556
01:35:18,320 --> 01:35:20,020
Thank you for the super chat.

2557
01:35:20,120 --> 01:35:20,460
Thank you.

2558
01:35:20,780 --> 01:35:22,900
No, I don't show my strats on stream.

2559
01:35:23,140 --> 01:35:23,820
That's the key.

2560
01:35:23,940 --> 01:35:24,740
I figured it out.

2561
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,160
Like I said, I'll play everybody but King.

2562
01:35:27,200 --> 01:35:27,900
So they won't...

2563
01:35:27,900 --> 01:35:31,400
They won't think about countering me on King.

2564
01:35:31,400 --> 01:35:36,600
They'll like try to figure out how to counter me on every other character but King.

2565
01:35:40,340 --> 01:35:42,940
Oh, apparently all Tekken characters understand each other.

2566
01:35:43,040 --> 01:35:43,760
Wait, that's crazy.

2567
01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:44,920
That's... that's insane.

2568
01:35:45,240 --> 01:35:45,940
That's amazing.

2569
01:36:10,700 --> 01:36:12,440
I wish that was real.

2570
01:36:12,680 --> 01:36:15,360
I can just understand everybody else's languages.

2571
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:23,660
Yeah!

2572
01:36:26,980 --> 01:36:28,520
Oh wait, there's me.

2573
01:36:29,300 --> 01:36:31,260
He wishes he was King.

2574
01:36:47,820 --> 01:36:48,640
What's that?

2575
01:36:48,800 --> 01:36:49,540
Is that me too?

2576
01:36:51,520 --> 01:36:52,740
Oh yeah, it's devil me.

2577
01:37:01,340 --> 01:37:02,860
Simple and clean.

2578
01:37:11,320 --> 01:37:13,140
Sora, wake up, Sora.

2579
01:37:13,460 --> 01:37:14,320
Wake up!

2580
01:37:28,730 --> 01:37:30,010
Oh, is that my mom?

2581
01:37:48,240 --> 01:37:50,760
I think he has mommy and daddy issues.

2582
01:37:53,260 --> 01:37:54,420
Developed by Bandai!

2583
01:38:06,560 --> 01:38:07,000
Whoa!

2584
01:38:09,180 --> 01:38:09,780
What's that?

2585
01:38:15,630 --> 01:38:17,030
He's better off as an orphan.

2586
01:38:17,250 --> 01:38:18,450
Not gonna lie with all those issues.

2587
01:38:20,190 --> 01:38:23,830
I feel like he'd be way more well adjusted if he was an orphan.

2588
01:38:29,150 --> 01:38:30,570
Yeah, he has mommy issues.

2589
01:38:30,570 --> 01:38:32,130
The issue is she's dead.

2590
01:38:32,210 --> 01:38:33,050
Oh my god!

2591
01:38:40,760 --> 01:38:41,420
What's this?

2592
01:38:45,160 --> 01:38:45,600
Mishima.

2593
01:38:48,400 --> 01:38:49,380
Wait, he's rich!

2594
01:38:51,700 --> 01:38:52,800
He's Mishima, right?

2595
01:39:17,060 --> 01:39:18,480
Oh my god, he's so rich.

2596
01:39:18,580 --> 01:39:19,660
How does he have so many issues?

2597
01:39:22,380 --> 01:39:25,800
It's because he's this rich that he has so many issues.

2598
01:39:25,800 --> 01:39:26,940
Oh my god, he's so rich.

2599
01:39:28,280 --> 01:39:29,520
He's so rich that he has so many issues.

2600
01:39:29,520 --> 01:39:31,200
He's so rich

2601
01:39:35,640 --> 01:39:35,640
that he has so many issues.

2602
01:39:35,840 --> 01:39:40,180
His dad is rich, him not so much, but then he gets the money passed down to him.

2603
01:39:40,440 --> 01:39:41,360
It's called inheritance.

2604
01:39:46,120 --> 01:39:47,240
He's rich, why evil?

2605
01:39:47,240 --> 01:39:48,320
If rich, why evil?

2606
01:39:48,500 --> 01:39:51,460
Okay, that counters each other.

2607
01:39:51,920 --> 01:39:53,860
If rich is evil.

2608
01:39:56,660 --> 01:39:58,800
No rich person is innocent.

2609
01:40:01,900 --> 01:40:04,220
That's how they get rich in the first place.

2610
01:40:07,060 --> 01:40:13,440
It's been one week since Kazuyo Mishima, head of G-Corporation, shot down the key military satellites.

2611
01:40:14,240 --> 01:40:21,140
While the militaries of the world are unable to function, the qualifiers for G-Corporation's tournament have begun.

2612
01:40:21,960 --> 01:40:29,000
The whole world is watching this tournament that gives power to the victorious country and levies penalties on the losers.

2613
01:40:29,020 --> 01:40:29,040
The whole world is watching this tournament that gives power to the victorious country and levies penalties on the losers.

2614
01:40:36,720 --> 01:40:39,520
Charity is my power.

2615
01:40:44,240 --> 01:40:44,560
It's okay.

2616
01:40:44,560 --> 01:40:46,560
No matter where you are now.

2617
01:40:47,340 --> 01:40:48,220
I will not accept your doom.

2618
01:40:48,220 --> 01:40:48,240
You can do what you want.

2619
01:40:48,240 --> 01:40:48,360
I will not accept what you want.

2620
01:40:48,380 --> 01:40:54,840
Everyone has their own fate.

2621
01:40:56,140 --> 01:40:56,600
That's not what I want.

2622
01:40:56,600 --> 01:40:57,040
Also, I'm not a good confidant.

2623
01:40:57,660 --> 01:40:58,520
You're not good enough to make me cry.

2624
01:40:58,520 --> 01:40:58,680
You can't tell me you're not good.

2625
01:41:00,440 --> 01:41:00,760
I'm fine.

2626
01:41:00,940 --> 01:41:01,540
Thank you.

2627
01:41:01,560 --> 01:41:01,920
Here we go.

2628
01:41:02,620 --> 01:41:03,460
I got this.

2629
01:41:03,680 --> 01:41:04,740
Oh, I blocked!

2630
01:41:05,200 --> 01:41:06,100
Did you guys see that?

2631
01:41:07,900 --> 01:41:08,760
Oh my god!

2632
01:41:10,520 --> 01:41:11,480
Oh god.

2633
01:41:11,800 --> 01:41:12,280
Okay.

2634
01:41:12,460 --> 01:41:12,920
Wow!

2635
01:41:13,120 --> 01:41:13,480
Shit!

2636
01:41:13,520 --> 01:41:13,920
Did I block?

2637
01:41:14,220 --> 01:41:14,940
Oh shit!

2638
01:41:15,080 --> 01:41:15,520
Bro, sorry!

2639
01:41:17,620 --> 01:41:18,860
Actually got the tutorial.

2640
01:41:20,040 --> 01:41:20,520
Accident.

2641
01:41:21,020 --> 01:41:21,780
There you go.

2642
01:41:22,400 --> 01:41:22,880
Nice.

2643
01:41:24,920 --> 01:41:26,260
I stepped on him!

2644
01:41:31,620 --> 01:41:32,900
I blocked, guys.

2645
01:41:33,240 --> 01:41:34,320
I figured it out.

2646
01:41:36,940 --> 01:41:38,060
Oh shit!

2647
01:41:38,120 --> 01:41:39,020
Sorry, I got too excited.

2648
01:41:40,440 --> 01:41:44,540
I got so excited that I blocked that I forgot about everything else.

2649
01:41:49,140 --> 01:41:49,700
Okay.

2650
01:41:49,860 --> 01:41:50,360
Oh no.

2651
01:41:50,480 --> 01:41:50,900
Oh no.

2652
01:41:52,280 --> 01:41:52,840
No!

2653
01:41:53,060 --> 01:41:53,400
No!

2654
01:41:54,180 --> 01:41:55,020
Wrong block!

2655
01:41:57,320 --> 01:41:58,060
Oh god.

2656
01:41:58,580 --> 01:41:59,320
Oh god.

2657
01:41:59,580 --> 01:42:00,580
Oh my god.

2658
01:42:00,620 --> 01:42:00,760
No!

2659
01:42:00,900 --> 01:42:01,540
He can't block!

2660
01:42:01,560 --> 01:42:01,860
He counters me!

2661
01:42:02,180 --> 01:42:02,700
No!

2662
01:42:03,260 --> 01:42:04,860
He learned my patterns!

2663
01:42:09,400 --> 01:42:10,160
Oh shit!

2664
01:42:10,220 --> 01:42:10,820
Oh shit!

2665
01:42:10,920 --> 01:42:11,520
Oh no!

2666
01:42:11,600 --> 01:42:12,240
That's not good!

2667
01:42:12,440 --> 01:42:13,340
That's not good!

2668
01:42:13,540 --> 01:42:14,720
That's not good at all!

2669
01:42:15,500 --> 01:42:16,980
This is all I know how to do!

2670
01:42:18,740 --> 01:42:19,780
Oh shit!

2671
01:42:19,860 --> 01:42:20,180
No!

2672
01:42:21,280 --> 01:42:22,200
I lose?

2673
01:42:22,300 --> 01:42:24,320
I got one round off him!

2674
01:42:24,760 --> 01:42:25,960
How do I lose?

2675
01:42:27,400 --> 01:42:29,640
He gets two rounds and I get one?

2676
01:42:29,640 --> 01:42:32,260
This is absolutely bullshit.

2677
01:42:35,420 --> 01:42:37,000
I can't believe it.

2678
01:42:37,080 --> 01:42:38,700
This is so messed up.

2679
01:42:41,720 --> 01:42:43,620
I can't believe it.

2680
01:42:46,180 --> 01:42:46,860
It's fine.

2681
01:42:47,960 --> 01:42:48,740
It's fine.

2682
01:42:49,300 --> 01:42:50,280
No, no, no, no.

2683
01:42:50,280 --> 01:42:50,460
It's fine!

2684
01:42:50,800 --> 01:42:51,820
He's done CI!

2685
01:42:52,200 --> 01:42:53,760
I blocked so many!

2686
01:42:54,200 --> 01:42:55,780
Okay, and then he fucks me up.

2687
01:42:58,400 --> 01:42:59,620
Okay, and then he fucks me up.

2688
01:43:00,680 --> 01:43:01,380
There we go.

2689
01:43:02,260 --> 01:43:03,420
Oh, yeah, I see that.

2690
01:43:05,960 --> 01:43:07,140
Get comboed, dude!

2691
01:43:14,500 --> 01:43:15,780
Okay, they won't expect this.

2692
01:43:18,440 --> 01:43:20,500
The AI can't expect that.

2693
01:43:22,680 --> 01:43:25,260
I told you, the AI cannot expect that.

2694
01:43:28,360 --> 01:43:30,180
Guys, I got a combo going on!

2695
01:43:30,300 --> 01:43:30,880
Oh shit!

2696
01:43:31,140 --> 01:43:32,520
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

2697
01:43:33,180 --> 01:43:34,380
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

2698
01:43:35,480 --> 01:43:35,920
Grab him!

2699
01:43:36,320 --> 01:43:36,700
Grab him!

2700
01:43:36,740 --> 01:43:36,840
No!

2701
01:43:38,040 --> 01:43:38,460
Oh God!

2702
01:43:39,560 --> 01:43:39,820
Come on!

2703
01:43:40,480 --> 01:43:40,720
Nice!

2704
01:43:42,680 --> 01:43:43,160
Come on!

2705
01:43:43,400 --> 01:43:44,320
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

2706
01:43:44,420 --> 01:43:44,660
Yes!

2707
01:43:44,660 --> 01:43:44,880
Grab!

2708
01:43:47,740 --> 01:43:47,980
Woop!

2709
01:43:50,080 --> 01:43:51,080
Yeah, I'm making progress!

2710
01:43:51,080 --> 01:43:56,980
How can you predict chaos exactly?

2711
01:44:07,100 --> 01:44:12,160
Yeah, they can't detect my combos if I don't know the combos.

2712
01:44:12,540 --> 01:44:13,200
Exactly!

2713
01:44:15,540 --> 01:44:18,520
Jin, show me the power of the devil.

2714
01:44:19,060 --> 01:44:19,460
Okay.

2715
01:44:33,010 --> 01:44:33,750
What's this?

2716
01:44:34,850 --> 01:44:36,150
Oh no, I'm having PTSD.

2717
01:44:42,990 --> 01:44:44,830
No, I'm not a Jin character!

2718
01:44:45,330 --> 01:44:45,970
I'm King!

2719
01:44:48,690 --> 01:44:54,150
And if you are one of the participants trying to scope up the competition, I am not a King player.

2720
01:44:54,230 --> 01:44:55,030
I was just joking.

2721
01:44:55,870 --> 01:44:57,290
I don't know how to play King.

2722
01:45:00,490 --> 01:45:02,070
I'm not King main, I swear.

2723
01:45:17,840 --> 01:45:19,080
I don't know who King is.

2724
01:45:19,140 --> 01:45:19,680
Who is King?

2725
01:45:19,680 --> 01:45:21,700
I've never seen that man in my life.

2726
01:45:42,420 --> 01:45:43,420
She's a robot?

2727
01:45:46,990 --> 01:45:48,890
Yeah, a robot would dress like that.

2728
01:45:49,690 --> 01:45:55,630
She seems like definitely a type of outfit where she can never take off.

2729
01:46:07,470 --> 01:46:09,690
AI generated faction!

2730
01:46:09,690 --> 01:46:10,270
I'm laughing.

2731
01:46:12,630 --> 01:46:22,090
I'm glad I don't have to lecture her.

2732
01:46:24,310 --> 01:46:25,270
J.

2733
01:46:25,270 --> 01:46:25,610
I'm a freak.

2734
01:46:26,010 --> 01:46:27,410
I'm a freak.

2735
01:46:27,410 --> 01:46:28,650
I'm a freak.

2736
01:46:28,650 --> 01:46:28,670
I can't believe she's a freak.

2737
01:46:28,850 --> 01:46:29,890
listening to music...

2738
01:46:29,890 --> 01:46:30,510
Jesus.

2739
01:46:34,250 --> 01:46:35,210
I'm a freak.

2740
01:46:35,210 --> 01:46:35,750
She's a freak.

2741
01:46:35,750 --> 01:46:36,290
Who are you going to kill me?

2742
01:46:36,290 --> 01:46:37,250
Come on.

2743
01:46:50,150 --> 01:46:50,750
Yeah!

2744
01:46:50,970 --> 01:46:52,070
He has to go!

2745
01:46:52,270 --> 01:46:53,230
He needs the money!

2746
01:46:53,730 --> 01:46:55,250
He needs the inheritance!

2747
01:46:56,250 --> 01:46:58,870
Wait, apparently the dad has 40 kids?

2748
01:46:59,030 --> 01:47:00,450
What happened to the 39 kids?

2749
01:47:01,870 --> 01:47:05,730
Oh, I think we all know what happened to the 39 kids.

2750
01:47:27,590 --> 01:47:30,230
Oh, grandpa has 40 kids!

2751
01:47:30,750 --> 01:47:31,050
Oh!

2752
01:47:32,590 --> 01:47:34,590
Wait, Lars is my brother?

2753
01:47:39,430 --> 01:47:41,590
39 kids left the church.

2754
01:47:41,630 --> 01:47:41,750
Oh, I'm going to chat.

2755
01:47:46,250 --> 01:47:49,310
Looking at two of them in this scene and saw one in the...

2756
01:47:49,310 --> 01:47:49,510
Wait!

2757
01:47:49,770 --> 01:47:52,690
Is this all just like... Oh, Lars is the uncle!

2758
01:47:53,790 --> 01:47:55,970
Oh, my grandpa is the asshole!

2759
01:47:56,250 --> 01:47:56,990
I see.

2760
01:47:58,670 --> 01:48:01,290
Or like, is my dad... my dad is the asshole?

2761
01:48:01,530 --> 01:48:07,310
And then he... him and the other is the... Lars and my dad is the... is...

2762
01:48:08,330 --> 01:48:10,290
Um... my... like, they're brothers?

2763
01:48:11,630 --> 01:48:12,190
Yeah, okay.

2764
01:48:12,550 --> 01:48:13,550
Oh, okay.

2765
01:48:13,610 --> 01:48:15,130
I'm starting to figure this out.

2766
01:48:16,670 --> 01:48:19,950
So, both grandpa and dad are bad people.

2767
01:48:20,210 --> 01:48:22,390
And I think my game crashed.

2768
01:48:22,690 --> 01:48:24,210
I can't tell yet.

2769
01:48:24,530 --> 01:48:26,030
I can't tell.

2770
01:48:28,830 --> 01:48:30,190
It's not moving!

2771
01:48:30,690 --> 01:48:31,710
Nothing's moving!

2772
01:48:31,850 --> 01:48:32,650
I can't tell!

2773
01:48:38,190 --> 01:48:41,210
Guys, I can't tell if it's baiting me.

2774
01:48:41,210 --> 01:48:42,110
Guys...

2775
01:48:42,110 --> 01:48:44,210
Did it crash?

2776
01:48:44,610 --> 01:48:45,190
I don't know!

2777
01:48:45,670 --> 01:48:48,910
Checking has baited me so often, I can't tell anymore!

2778
01:48:49,410 --> 01:48:50,810
I don't know!

2779
01:48:51,750 --> 01:48:55,910
Like, actually... I don't know.

2780
01:49:01,790 --> 01:49:03,310
Let it cook.

2781
01:49:03,490 --> 01:49:03,790
Okay.

2782
01:49:03,910 --> 01:49:05,010
Let it cook.

2783
01:49:05,370 --> 01:49:06,710
The 8's not moving!

2784
01:49:06,950 --> 01:49:07,490
That's why!

2785
01:49:07,870 --> 01:49:09,730
The 8's not moving!

2786
01:49:13,330 --> 01:49:16,850
I can't tell if terrible load times or if it's crashing!

2787
01:49:17,970 --> 01:49:20,270
I mean, to be fair, we did like...

2788
01:49:20,270 --> 01:49:23,470
We did like, survive for a while, though.

2789
01:49:24,090 --> 01:49:25,030
Is this crashed?

2790
01:49:25,310 --> 01:49:28,030
Okay, to be fair, I'll have to say, though...

2791
01:49:28,030 --> 01:49:29,470
We did get really far.

2792
01:49:29,550 --> 01:49:31,210
Okay, let's end this with a king fight.

2793
01:49:31,370 --> 01:49:35,430
I've learned so much with playing Jhin that I think we can end it on...

2794
01:49:35,430 --> 01:49:38,610
Let's do one last game and then we'll play king today.

2795
01:49:43,230 --> 01:49:45,610
I couldn't tell if it was loading or crashing.

2796
01:49:45,890 --> 01:49:48,330
I just decided to just force quit it.

2797
01:49:53,660 --> 01:49:54,660
Alright, here we go.

2798
01:49:56,900 --> 01:49:59,020
Yeah, I couldn't tell if it was loading or not.

2799
01:49:59,140 --> 01:50:01,220
It's so hard to tell for this game.

2800
01:50:02,880 --> 01:50:04,160
Tekken is like...

2801
01:50:05,280 --> 01:50:06,900
I just couldn't tell.

2802
01:50:09,920 --> 01:50:11,280
Is the maintenance over?

2803
01:50:12,440 --> 01:50:13,040
Is it?

2804
01:50:14,600 --> 01:50:16,340
Fancy, welcome to the tomato farm!

2805
01:50:16,440 --> 01:50:17,080
Welcome, welcome!

2806
01:50:17,580 --> 01:50:18,680
Hey, the 8 is moving, though.

2807
01:50:19,380 --> 01:50:20,180
Yay, Bandai!

2808
01:50:26,140 --> 01:50:27,040
Alright, here we go.

2809
01:50:32,110 --> 01:50:33,250
Thank you for the super chat.

2810
01:50:33,310 --> 01:50:34,030
Thank you, thank you.

2811
01:50:34,050 --> 01:50:37,070
Grandpa threw dad off the cliff, so dad threw grandpa in the volcano.

2812
01:50:37,370 --> 01:50:40,270
This is the whole story from Tekken 1 to 7.

2813
01:50:40,890 --> 01:50:42,130
That's all we need to know.

2814
01:50:42,230 --> 01:50:43,590
Thank you for the super chat.

2815
01:50:43,690 --> 01:50:44,490
Thank you, thank you.

2816
01:50:45,130 --> 01:50:45,530
Alright.

2817
01:50:47,470 --> 01:50:48,610
King's death roll?

2818
01:50:48,790 --> 01:50:49,250
What's that?

2819
01:50:50,910 --> 01:50:52,790
Um, Alexis, thank you for the super chat.

2820
01:50:52,850 --> 01:50:53,410
Thank you, thank you.

2821
01:50:53,470 --> 01:50:59,610
You gotta learn the Korean backdash and King's death roll.

2822
01:50:59,730 --> 01:51:00,190
Oh, shit!

2823
01:51:00,290 --> 01:51:00,970
I got all that.

2824
01:51:01,230 --> 01:51:02,090
But I don't need that.

2825
01:51:02,750 --> 01:51:03,770
Alright, let's see.

2826
01:51:05,310 --> 01:51:05,710
Uh...

2827
01:51:07,490 --> 01:51:08,290
Versus CPU.

2828
01:51:09,570 --> 01:51:09,970
Okay.

2829
01:51:11,070 --> 01:51:11,870
Versus CPU.

2830
01:51:12,370 --> 01:51:12,770
Alright.

2831
01:51:14,650 --> 01:51:16,830
Yeah, I'm ready to rep Tekken 8 at EVO.

2832
01:51:16,870 --> 01:51:17,190
Okay.

2833
01:51:18,110 --> 01:51:18,830
This is it.

2834
01:51:18,910 --> 01:51:19,230
Okay.

2835
01:51:20,290 --> 01:51:20,730
Wait.

2836
01:51:21,090 --> 01:51:21,530
Okay.

2837
01:51:21,710 --> 01:51:22,490
This is it.

2838
01:51:23,830 --> 01:51:26,490
Guys, I learned so much from King.

2839
01:51:27,070 --> 01:51:28,370
That I think I got this.

2840
01:51:30,770 --> 01:51:32,070
It's gonna be so easy.

2841
01:51:37,930 --> 01:51:39,210
It's gonna be so easy.

2842
01:51:39,230 --> 01:51:40,210
I can feel it.

2843
01:51:40,570 --> 01:51:42,170
All I have to do is grab.

2844
01:51:44,150 --> 01:51:44,590
Alright.

2845
01:51:44,590 --> 01:51:45,030
Hard?

2846
01:51:45,290 --> 01:51:45,770
You know what?

2847
01:51:45,910 --> 01:51:47,570
I think I'm ready for hard level.

2848
01:51:49,850 --> 01:51:51,250
I'm ready for hard level.

2849
01:51:54,610 --> 01:51:55,510
I'll do random.

2850
01:51:56,850 --> 01:51:58,250
Take me anywhere in the world.

2851
01:51:59,370 --> 01:52:00,110
Urban Square?

2852
01:52:00,370 --> 01:52:00,770
Let's go.

2853
01:52:02,250 --> 01:52:03,030
This is it.

2854
01:52:03,110 --> 01:52:03,810
I'll show you guys.

2855
01:52:03,990 --> 01:52:05,630
I'll show you my power level right here.

2856
01:52:07,630 --> 01:52:14,650
By the way, if you're scoping out the competition, if any of like coaches or like team, like participants scoping out the competition, I'm not a King Ming.

2857
01:52:15,150 --> 01:52:16,070
I'm just...

2858
01:52:16,070 --> 01:52:16,950
I... I... I...

2859
01:52:16,950 --> 01:52:18,690
This is my very first time playing him.

2860
01:52:18,790 --> 01:52:21,070
But I'll never main this character ever in my world.

2861
01:52:21,250 --> 01:52:22,770
I'll never main him at all.

2862
01:52:24,410 --> 01:52:25,550
I'm just messing about.

2863
01:52:33,290 --> 01:52:34,390
Guys, did I crash?

2864
01:52:35,010 --> 01:52:36,050
Or is this loading?

2865
01:52:36,890 --> 01:52:37,850
We'll never know.

2866
01:52:39,510 --> 01:52:41,670
Guys, the 8's not moving guys.

2867
01:52:43,310 --> 01:52:43,790
Guys.

2868
01:52:44,390 --> 01:52:45,990
The 8's not moving.

2869
01:52:45,990 --> 01:52:47,330
I can't tell.

2870
01:52:51,570 --> 01:52:52,890
It crashed.

2871
01:52:53,470 --> 01:52:54,130
No!

2872
01:53:00,590 --> 01:53:01,630
It's forever.

2873
01:53:01,810 --> 01:53:03,190
Let's play a little game guys.

2874
01:53:03,390 --> 01:53:04,370
Did the game crash?

2875
01:53:04,670 --> 01:53:08,070
Guys, it's just because I love the main menu so much.

2876
01:53:09,530 --> 01:53:14,150
I swear I'll set up my new PC after before the tournament.

2877
01:53:14,530 --> 01:53:15,610
I swear.

2878
01:53:15,610 --> 01:53:16,710
I swear guys.

2879
01:53:17,010 --> 01:53:20,530
I'll definitely set up my new PC before the tournament.

2880
01:53:25,470 --> 01:53:27,030
Guys, it'll be fine.

2881
01:53:27,290 --> 01:53:28,190
We'll be fine.

2882
01:53:28,670 --> 01:53:30,230
We'll be so healthy.

2883
01:53:35,510 --> 01:53:36,090
Guys.

2884
01:53:36,370 --> 01:53:36,950
Guys.

2885
01:53:37,070 --> 01:53:40,750
For any of my future competitors, I'm going to be an Eddy main.

2886
01:53:40,850 --> 01:53:42,890
So just learn how to counter the Eddy spam.

2887
01:53:42,890 --> 01:53:44,670
That's all you need to know.

2888
01:53:44,890 --> 01:53:47,730
I will never play any other hero but Eddy.

2889
01:53:50,550 --> 01:53:51,390
I swear.

2890
01:53:52,490 --> 01:53:53,990
100% truth.

2891
01:53:58,250 --> 01:54:02,470
This will be the only time I ever play King today.

2892
01:54:04,640 --> 01:54:04,930
True.

2893
01:54:05,010 --> 01:54:05,850
So true.

2894
01:54:06,730 --> 01:54:09,970
Guys, I don't even think I can get into the main menu anymore.

2895
01:54:09,970 --> 01:54:14,810
I'm going to be like, Is this a crash or is this loading for a very long time?

2896
01:54:15,330 --> 01:54:16,070
Is this...

2897
01:54:16,070 --> 01:54:22,930
I like this little game we play, chat.

2898
01:54:23,230 --> 01:54:25,990
This little fun game that we play.

2899
01:54:29,210 --> 01:54:31,990
Yeah, Eddy, my favorite Apex Legends.

2900
01:54:33,550 --> 01:54:36,150
I don't think this is loading anymore.

2901
01:54:37,950 --> 01:54:39,250
It's part of the experience.

2902
01:54:42,570 --> 01:54:44,810
It's part of the experience, chat.

2903
01:54:45,910 --> 01:54:46,390
Guys.

2904
01:54:46,710 --> 01:54:48,370
Oh, it has to be loading.

2905
01:54:48,470 --> 01:54:50,150
My cursor is gone.

2906
01:54:50,610 --> 01:54:51,570
The 8 appeared.

2907
01:54:52,310 --> 01:54:53,330
Oh no, my...

2908
01:54:53,330 --> 01:54:54,070
The 8 appeared.

2909
01:54:54,330 --> 01:54:55,070
It's loading.

2910
01:54:55,290 --> 01:54:56,050
Look, the 8.

2911
01:54:56,210 --> 01:54:57,650
I swear the 8 was moving earlier.

2912
01:54:57,950 --> 01:54:58,770
See, it's moving.

2913
01:54:59,170 --> 01:54:59,650
Bandai.

2914
01:54:59,970 --> 01:55:00,870
Okay, there we go.

2915
01:55:01,350 --> 01:55:02,110
This is it.

2916
01:55:02,130 --> 01:55:02,650
This time.

2917
01:55:02,790 --> 01:55:04,050
This time I can fight.

2918
01:55:04,330 --> 01:55:05,290
This time I can fight.

2919
01:55:08,380 --> 01:55:08,800
Guys.

2920
01:55:09,760 --> 01:55:10,780
Where's the main menu?

2921
01:55:17,920 --> 01:55:19,280
Oh, there he is.

2922
01:55:19,300 --> 01:55:19,680
There's Eddy.

2923
01:55:20,320 --> 01:55:21,780
Eddy, there you are.

2924
01:55:22,080 --> 01:55:23,780
I knew you were going to be here.

2925
01:55:24,340 --> 01:55:24,960
All right.

2926
01:55:25,620 --> 01:55:26,640
Main menu time.

2927
01:55:26,820 --> 01:55:27,480
We made it.

2928
01:55:27,500 --> 01:55:28,720
We made it to the menu.

2929
01:55:29,820 --> 01:55:30,840
We did it.

2930
01:55:30,900 --> 01:55:33,200
We actually made it to the menu, everybody.

2931
01:55:36,400 --> 01:55:37,860
No, my PC is okay.

2932
01:55:38,600 --> 01:55:40,160
Shh, PC, it's okay.

2933
01:55:40,240 --> 01:55:40,920
They don't mean that.

2934
01:55:41,060 --> 01:55:42,480
I'll never replace you.

2935
01:55:42,660 --> 01:55:43,100
Shh.

2936
01:55:46,440 --> 01:55:51,000
I swear PC, the Hyatt, the Hyatt PC is just naver decoration.

2937
01:55:51,460 --> 01:55:53,920
I swear, I would never do anything to you.

2938
01:55:54,180 --> 01:55:55,140
Right, Let's see.

2939
01:55:55,200 --> 01:55:56,560
Practice vs CPU.

2940
01:56:01,400 --> 01:56:02,960
I don't mean it.

2941
01:56:06,500 --> 01:56:07,760
It's not lagging.

2942
01:56:07,780 --> 01:56:08,760
It's just your stream.

2943
01:56:08,760 --> 01:56:09,160
Dream!

2944
01:56:10,520 --> 01:56:11,400
4k anime...

2945
01:56:11,940 --> 01:56:14,660
It's all low quality, it can't be 4k.

2946
01:56:15,660 --> 01:56:16,720
Alright, there you go.

2947
01:56:17,160 --> 01:56:19,380
Alright, my very first time playing King.

2948
01:56:20,100 --> 01:56:21,760
My very first time.

2949
01:56:22,340 --> 01:56:24,800
Never touched this character in my life.

2950
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:30,260
Unlucky, thank you for the super chat.

2951
01:56:30,320 --> 01:56:31,060
Thank you, thank you.

2952
01:56:31,120 --> 01:56:32,800
Anton, thank you for the super chat.

2953
01:56:32,880 --> 01:56:33,860
Thank you, thank you.

2954
01:56:34,940 --> 01:56:35,820
Alright, hard.

2955
01:56:36,400 --> 01:56:37,140
This is it.

2956
01:56:38,180 --> 01:56:39,220
We got this.

2957
01:56:42,930 --> 01:56:43,970
Is that like...

2958
01:56:43,970 --> 01:56:45,270
Pshh, PC, he does...

2959
01:56:45,270 --> 01:56:46,290
They don't mean this.

2960
01:56:46,810 --> 01:56:48,690
I can't wait to just listen to this song.

2961
01:56:49,170 --> 01:56:50,930
This is like the soundtrack simulator.

2962
01:56:51,590 --> 01:56:52,370
Oh my god!

2963
01:56:52,670 --> 01:56:53,110
Nice.

2964
01:56:53,330 --> 01:56:54,510
Now we're at midnight.

2965
01:56:54,690 --> 01:56:56,590
Okay, how far did we get last time?

2966
01:56:56,950 --> 01:56:57,390
Here!

2967
01:56:57,650 --> 01:56:59,810
This is how far we got to, right?

2968
01:57:00,590 --> 01:57:01,250
I'm ready.

2969
01:57:01,350 --> 01:57:02,570
I'm ready for the next battle.

2970
01:57:08,200 --> 01:57:09,820
Guys, the particles stopped...

2971
01:57:09,820 --> 01:57:10,820
The particles are moving!

2972
01:57:11,300 --> 01:57:12,260
Guys, the particles stopped.

2973
01:57:12,280 --> 01:57:12,700
The particles stopped moving.

2974
01:57:12,900 --> 01:57:14,180
I don't feel the...

2975
01:57:14,180 --> 01:57:15,700
Guys, the particles stopped moving.

2976
01:57:16,040 --> 01:57:17,520
Why is the particles not moving?

2977
01:57:17,760 --> 01:57:17,980
Please.

2978
01:57:18,120 --> 01:57:18,680
Oh, it's moving!

2979
01:57:19,120 --> 01:57:20,040
We're so back!

2980
01:57:20,320 --> 01:57:21,000
We're so back!

2981
01:57:22,680 --> 01:57:23,400
There's me!

2982
01:57:23,560 --> 01:57:25,160
My 25th phrase!

2983
01:57:25,500 --> 01:57:26,560
It's okay, shh.

2984
01:57:26,620 --> 01:57:27,320
It's okay, PC.

2985
01:57:27,320 --> 01:57:28,320
I'll never leave you.

2986
01:57:31,520 --> 01:57:34,160
We don't need phrase for the grab.

2987
01:57:36,140 --> 01:57:37,140
It's okay, PC.

2988
01:57:37,460 --> 01:57:39,360
Please stay strong for me.

2989
01:57:39,720 --> 01:57:41,480
Please stay strong for me.

2990
01:57:41,480 --> 01:57:42,660
I don't know what's happening.

2991
01:57:42,780 --> 01:57:44,260
Stay strong, PC.

2992
01:57:44,740 --> 01:57:45,240
Stay...

2993
01:57:45,240 --> 01:57:45,700
Okay, here we go.

2994
01:57:48,740 --> 01:57:49,920
This is it.

2995
01:57:50,340 --> 01:57:50,840
Boom!

2996
01:57:51,560 --> 01:57:53,180
And then they'll never expect this.

2997
01:57:53,520 --> 01:57:54,020
Boom!

2998
01:57:58,340 --> 01:57:58,840
Hard!

2999
01:57:59,220 --> 01:58:00,560
That's fucking right!

3000
01:58:01,640 --> 01:58:03,140
First time playing King, by the way.

3001
01:58:03,260 --> 01:58:04,500
I'll never play him again.

3002
01:58:04,620 --> 01:58:05,180
I swear.

3003
01:58:08,860 --> 01:58:09,360
Fight!

3004
01:58:11,040 --> 01:58:11,460
Fight!

3005
01:58:11,460 --> 01:58:16,540
By the way, I swear I will not play him again for all the people scoping out the competition.

3006
01:58:18,100 --> 01:58:18,860
There you go.

3007
01:58:19,840 --> 01:58:20,280
Oh!

3008
01:58:20,560 --> 01:58:21,000
Oh!

3009
01:58:21,300 --> 01:58:22,240
Oh, don't worry.

3010
01:58:22,320 --> 01:58:22,940
I got this.

3011
01:58:23,480 --> 01:58:24,500
I got this!

3012
01:58:24,540 --> 01:58:24,940
Boom!

3013
01:58:25,320 --> 01:58:26,500
And then I got this!

3014
01:58:26,840 --> 01:58:27,280
Yeah!

3015
01:58:28,980 --> 01:58:30,300
And I can grab you!

3016
01:58:31,300 --> 01:58:31,740
Easy!

3017
01:58:33,040 --> 01:58:34,440
Not a King Ming, by the way.

3018
01:58:39,660 --> 01:58:40,600
We're so back.

3019
01:58:40,820 --> 01:58:41,440
Oh, shit.

3020
01:58:41,460 --> 01:58:44,340
How are you gonna counter this?

3021
01:58:44,720 --> 01:58:45,300
Bam!

3022
01:58:45,820 --> 01:58:47,440
How the fuck did you counter this?

3023
01:58:47,620 --> 01:58:48,000
Bam!

3024
01:58:48,660 --> 01:58:49,240
Bam!

3025
01:58:50,140 --> 01:58:51,160
You don't.

3026
01:58:51,340 --> 01:58:52,640
You don't counter this.

3027
01:58:52,820 --> 01:58:53,380
Boom!

3028
01:58:54,230 --> 01:58:54,520
Boom!

3029
01:58:56,180 --> 01:58:56,760
Boom!

3030
01:58:58,060 --> 01:58:59,900
And then I swing you!

3031
01:59:00,460 --> 01:59:01,500
Look at me go!

3032
01:59:01,840 --> 01:59:02,940
And then stab!

3033
01:59:03,660 --> 01:59:04,640
We did it.

3034
01:59:06,340 --> 01:59:06,920
Easy.

3035
01:59:08,120 --> 01:59:09,920
This is hard CP!

3036
01:59:10,200 --> 01:59:11,180
Oh, shit!

3037
01:59:12,400 --> 01:59:13,240
Go, King!

3038
01:59:13,320 --> 01:59:13,580
Go!

3039
01:59:16,600 --> 01:59:18,400
How did she do it?

3040
01:59:18,440 --> 01:59:20,200
Don't worry, I'll never touch King again!

3041
01:59:26,700 --> 01:59:28,100
Sure, that was hard?

3042
01:59:28,220 --> 01:59:29,000
That was hard!

3043
01:59:29,380 --> 01:59:29,900
Yeah!

3044
01:59:30,060 --> 01:59:30,940
It was!

3045
01:59:32,600 --> 01:59:34,040
I know the combo!

3046
01:59:35,620 --> 01:59:37,160
Go, Ultra Heart!

3047
01:59:39,200 --> 01:59:40,780
Wait, how do I do Ultra Heart?

3048
01:59:40,780 --> 01:59:42,260
Do I just do rematch?

3049
01:59:42,640 --> 01:59:46,100
If I click rematch, can I change the difficulty from rematch?

3050
01:59:47,660 --> 01:59:48,820
That's not my main!

3051
01:59:49,400 --> 01:59:51,900
I don't know why you guys keep saying King is my main.

3052
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:54,300
What the f***?

3053
01:59:54,580 --> 01:59:57,800
Do I just do like quick select?

3054
01:59:58,100 --> 01:59:58,700
Oh, quick select.

3055
01:59:58,840 --> 01:59:59,140
Okay.

3056
01:59:59,640 --> 02:00:00,160
Alright.

3057
02:00:02,340 --> 02:00:03,500
This is confirmed.

3058
02:00:04,680 --> 02:00:05,720
And then...

3059
02:00:06,600 --> 02:00:08,720
Alright, and then... wait, how do I...

3060
02:00:09,320 --> 02:00:11,240
Wait, no, I don't wanna be... no, I'm King!

3061
02:00:12,240 --> 02:00:12,960
I'm King!

3062
02:00:14,920 --> 02:00:15,760
Okay, there we go.

3063
02:00:17,160 --> 02:00:18,000
Very hard.

3064
02:00:18,200 --> 02:00:18,740
Alright, here we go.

3065
02:00:20,480 --> 02:00:21,080
I'm ready.

3066
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:24,920
I'm so ready.

3067
02:00:25,320 --> 02:00:26,060
This is it.

3068
02:00:28,820 --> 02:00:29,740
I'm so ready.

3069
02:00:33,040 --> 02:00:33,460
Okay.

3070
02:00:34,740 --> 02:00:35,340
Let's see.

3071
02:00:35,660 --> 02:00:36,660
Oh, s***!

3072
02:00:36,800 --> 02:00:37,960
That is ultra hard!

3073
02:00:38,160 --> 02:00:38,700
Oh my...

3074
02:00:38,720 --> 02:00:40,160
Oh my god, that is ultra hard!

3075
02:00:44,900 --> 02:00:46,240
Who would've thought?

3076
02:00:46,560 --> 02:00:48,300
That is ultra hard, guys!

3077
02:00:50,800 --> 02:00:52,740
Oh my god, he's countering stuff now.

3078
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:54,820
That's right, but you can't counter this!

3079
02:00:55,120 --> 02:00:55,940
He countered it.

3080
02:00:56,020 --> 02:00:58,080
But it's okay, he doesn't know about this.

3081
02:01:00,420 --> 02:01:01,420
Get grabbed!

3082
02:01:03,480 --> 02:01:04,260
Get grabbed!

3083
02:01:04,480 --> 02:01:06,120
Oh, you thought that was a grab?

3084
02:01:06,480 --> 02:01:07,060
No, no, no!

3085
02:01:07,060 --> 02:01:08,080
Oh, s***!

3086
02:01:08,360 --> 02:01:09,340
That's f***ing right.

3087
02:01:09,520 --> 02:01:11,080
I didn't grab this tab.

3088
02:01:11,220 --> 02:01:11,680
Oh, s***!

3089
02:01:11,700 --> 02:01:12,880
That's right, but I blocked.

3090
02:01:17,620 --> 02:01:19,800
Oh my god, that's a lot of energy!

3091
02:01:20,280 --> 02:01:21,660
Oh, he went double mode!

3092
02:01:21,760 --> 02:01:22,540
He went sicko mode!

3093
02:01:23,200 --> 02:01:25,180
But I also went sicko mode.

3094
02:01:25,780 --> 02:01:27,060
That's f***ing right.

3095
02:01:31,680 --> 02:01:32,200
Nice.

3096
02:01:33,120 --> 02:01:33,940
Oh, s***.

3097
02:01:34,880 --> 02:01:36,560
Oh my god, he's countering me.

3098
02:01:36,600 --> 02:01:37,220
How does he know?

3099
02:01:37,800 --> 02:01:39,260
How does he know what I wanna do?

3100
02:01:39,360 --> 02:01:39,860
I don't understand.

3101
02:01:41,760 --> 02:01:42,360
That's fine.

3102
02:01:42,480 --> 02:01:43,400
But I can do this, though.

3103
02:01:43,900 --> 02:01:44,780
And I can do...

3104
02:01:44,780 --> 02:01:45,380
Woah, s***!

3105
02:01:45,620 --> 02:01:46,400
Oh, s***!

3106
02:01:46,420 --> 02:01:46,640
No!

3107
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:49,220
Oh god, oh god!

3108
02:01:49,560 --> 02:01:50,720
Come on, come on, counter!

3109
02:01:52,180 --> 02:01:53,100
No, no, no!

3110
02:01:53,520 --> 02:01:54,180
No, no!

3111
02:02:00,160 --> 02:02:00,960
Oh god.

3112
02:02:01,740 --> 02:02:02,140
Nice.

3113
02:02:02,220 --> 02:02:02,600
Okay.

3114
02:02:02,700 --> 02:02:02,900
No!

3115
02:02:02,900 --> 02:02:04,680
How does he read my input?

3116
02:02:06,060 --> 02:02:07,300
How does he know?

3117
02:02:08,120 --> 02:02:09,420
I don't understand.

3118
02:02:09,700 --> 02:02:10,280
How does he...

3119
02:02:10,280 --> 02:02:12,120
How does he know what I wanna do?

3120
02:02:15,880 --> 02:02:16,920
That's crazy.

3121
02:02:17,940 --> 02:02:19,400
But it's too bad.

3122
02:02:19,560 --> 02:02:20,280
It's over.

3123
02:02:20,660 --> 02:02:22,280
It's so over!

3124
02:02:25,760 --> 02:02:27,540
I told you.

3125
02:02:28,060 --> 02:02:29,340
I knew it!

3126
02:02:29,400 --> 02:02:30,500
I knew it!

3127
02:02:30,520 --> 02:02:32,880
No AI can download this!

3128
02:02:32,880 --> 02:02:33,160
No AI can download this brain!

3129
02:02:33,940 --> 02:02:35,060
No AI...

3130
02:02:37,100 --> 02:02:42,340
No AI can read what's going on in this brain!

3131
02:02:42,980 --> 02:02:44,220
Go ultra-hard?

3132
02:02:44,320 --> 02:02:45,020
Alright, let's do it.

3133
02:02:45,720 --> 02:02:48,400
Now go ultra-hard.

3134
02:02:48,400 --> 02:02:48,920
Alright.

3135
02:02:49,180 --> 02:02:51,380
That's f***ing right, I don't care.

3136
02:02:51,600 --> 02:02:52,540
We go harder.

3137
02:02:53,560 --> 02:02:54,820
Ultra-hard!

3138
02:02:55,560 --> 02:02:57,280
Get ready for the next battle!

3139
02:03:00,620 --> 02:03:02,060
Get ready for the next battle!

3140
02:03:02,360 --> 02:03:02,440
Get ready for the next battle!

3141
02:03:02,440 --> 02:03:02,860
Get ready for the next battle!

3142
02:03:02,860 --> 02:03:03,520
King main by the way.

3143
02:03:03,600 --> 02:03:06,860
Just so you guys know, I'm just naturally gifted.

3144
02:03:10,160 --> 02:03:12,280
Hey, I can't read this.

3145
02:03:13,340 --> 02:03:15,320
Oh shit, that's fucking right.

3146
02:03:15,500 --> 02:03:17,800
You didn't expect me to go that way, right?

3147
02:03:19,500 --> 02:03:20,640
That's fucking right.

3148
02:03:20,820 --> 02:03:21,880
Oh, oh shit.

3149
02:03:22,200 --> 02:03:24,660
Oh shit, but can you escape the grab?

3150
02:03:26,080 --> 02:03:27,160
No, you can't.

3151
02:03:27,160 --> 02:03:28,420
That's fucking right.

3152
02:03:28,600 --> 02:03:30,580
You can't escape the grab!

3153
02:03:31,240 --> 02:03:32,300
The grab!

3154
02:03:33,240 --> 02:03:34,340
The grab!

3155
02:03:34,340 --> 02:03:34,340
The grab!

3156
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:36,500
Now swing him!

3157
02:03:41,520 --> 02:03:42,900
Escape this, nerd!

3158
02:03:43,300 --> 02:03:44,680
That's right, you don't expect this!

3159
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:47,380
He expected it, guys.

3160
02:03:47,620 --> 02:03:49,180
But did he expect this, though?

3161
02:03:53,200 --> 02:03:54,280
I'm too powerful.

3162
02:03:54,840 --> 02:03:56,580
Oh no, wait, JK.

3163
02:03:57,840 --> 02:03:58,400
Yeah?

3164
02:03:58,720 --> 02:03:59,700
No, uh-uh.

3165
02:04:01,200 --> 02:04:01,720
CPU!

3166
02:04:01,860 --> 02:04:02,820
No, no, no, CPU!

3167
02:04:04,260 --> 02:04:05,280
Oh no.

3168
02:04:07,540 --> 02:04:08,060
Easy.

3169
02:04:10,160 --> 02:04:12,460
How does she keep getting away with this?

3170
02:04:12,500 --> 02:04:13,140
The Doki Grab!

3171
02:04:13,420 --> 02:04:14,960
Oh my god, the Doki Grab is back!

3172
02:04:17,480 --> 02:04:18,220
It's back!

3173
02:04:18,540 --> 02:04:19,720
It never left!

3174
02:04:20,540 --> 02:04:22,440
The Doki Grab never leaves!

3175
02:04:25,460 --> 02:04:27,680
Oh god, it's actually input reading me now.

3176
02:04:27,960 --> 02:04:30,320
Holy shit, he actually knows now.

3177
02:04:35,780 --> 02:04:37,580
Oh, fuck!

3178
02:04:37,580 --> 02:04:38,220
How does he know?

3179
02:04:38,540 --> 02:04:38,940
Okay.

3180
02:04:39,580 --> 02:04:41,680
Oh my god, how the fuck...

3181
02:04:42,420 --> 02:04:45,460
How the fuck does he know this has been my strength this entire time?

3182
02:04:46,120 --> 02:04:47,900
Ultra hard goes hard!

3183
02:04:51,450 --> 02:04:52,040
Oh, nice.

3184
02:04:53,960 --> 02:04:54,660
It's fine.

3185
02:04:55,120 --> 02:04:55,700
No!

3186
02:04:55,900 --> 02:04:56,940
It's not fine!

3187
02:04:57,820 --> 02:04:58,860
It's learning!

3188
02:04:59,280 --> 02:05:00,000
Please, the counter!

3189
02:05:00,040 --> 02:05:00,560
Grab it!

3190
02:05:00,560 --> 02:05:00,760
It's learning me!

3191
02:05:08,060 --> 02:05:10,100
Holy shit, he figured it out!

3192
02:05:11,080 --> 02:05:12,740
How did he figure- I don't understand.

3193
02:05:13,360 --> 02:05:14,800
How does he figure this out?

3194
02:05:16,140 --> 02:05:16,920
No, no, no.

3195
02:05:17,460 --> 02:05:18,440
I can do it too.

3196
02:05:20,180 --> 02:05:22,640
I can also do it... this.

3197
02:05:24,300 --> 02:05:24,980
Oh my god.

3198
02:05:25,380 --> 02:05:25,780
Nice.

3199
02:05:25,840 --> 02:05:26,180
That's fine.

3200
02:05:27,260 --> 02:05:27,860
That's fine.

3201
02:05:28,540 --> 02:05:29,180
It's okay.

3202
02:05:29,580 --> 02:05:30,280
It's okay.

3203
02:05:30,660 --> 02:05:31,420
We'll be fine.

3204
02:05:31,580 --> 02:05:32,180
It's not okay.

3205
02:05:32,300 --> 02:05:33,120
Oh my god.

3206
02:05:33,160 --> 02:05:33,740
It's not okay.

3207
02:05:33,960 --> 02:05:35,100
It's not okay.

3208
02:05:35,220 --> 02:05:36,520
He... no.

3209
02:05:36,680 --> 02:05:38,080
Please just... I need one grab.

3210
02:05:38,240 --> 02:05:39,420
I need one grab!

3211
02:05:39,640 --> 02:05:40,020
Yes!

3212
02:05:43,200 --> 02:05:44,920
Oh my god!

3213
02:05:45,480 --> 02:05:45,960
Yeah!

3214
02:05:46,560 --> 02:05:47,040
Undefeated!

3215
02:05:48,840 --> 02:05:49,320
Undefeated!

3216
02:05:49,380 --> 02:05:49,880
Let's go!

3217
02:05:49,880 --> 02:05:50,120
Let's go!

3218
02:05:53,960 --> 02:05:55,680
It's not hard enough.

3219
02:05:56,420 --> 02:05:57,820
Let's fucking go!

3220
02:05:58,080 --> 02:05:59,520
I figured it out!

3221
02:06:00,180 --> 02:06:01,560
I figured it out!

3222
02:06:04,420 --> 02:06:05,820
Doki the King.

3223
02:06:06,440 --> 02:06:07,700
Oh my god!

3224
02:06:08,880 --> 02:06:09,920
Oh my god!

3225
02:06:09,940 --> 02:06:12,540
I can't believe I did this without my main character!

3226
02:06:13,540 --> 02:06:15,000
Not a King main!

3227
02:06:20,700 --> 02:06:21,300
Alright.

3228
02:06:21,460 --> 02:06:22,340
I think...

3229
02:06:23,280 --> 02:06:23,880
Alright.

3230
02:06:23,960 --> 02:06:25,720
I think that's a good time to call it for today.

3231
02:06:26,240 --> 02:06:27,460
Doki the King.

3232
02:06:27,540 --> 02:06:29,140
The Ultra Hard Master.

3233
02:06:30,520 --> 02:06:32,920
They need a harder mode for me!

3234
02:06:33,780 --> 02:06:35,180
Oh my god!

3235
02:06:38,980 --> 02:06:40,120
GG's everybody.

3236
02:06:41,140 --> 02:06:44,140
Oh what a way to call it here.

3237
02:06:44,500 --> 02:06:45,840
I can't believe it.

3238
02:06:45,900 --> 02:06:47,960
We got all the way to Ultra Mode.

3239
02:06:48,500 --> 02:06:50,380
We fucking did it!

3240
02:06:50,700 --> 02:06:53,320
We fucking did it guys!

3241
02:06:54,540 --> 02:06:55,060
Oh!

3242
02:06:55,880 --> 02:06:56,400
Anyway.

3243
02:06:56,560 --> 02:06:57,920
I'm gonna call it here everyone.

3244
02:06:58,900 --> 02:07:00,460
We had two streams today.

3245
02:07:00,700 --> 02:07:03,520
So today is a good time to rest now.

3246
02:07:03,820 --> 02:07:05,220
I have a lot of work to do today.

3247
02:07:05,540 --> 02:07:09,260
So it was a great time to stream Tekken for the first time.

3248
02:07:09,720 --> 02:07:11,340
Tekken 8 for the first time.

3249
02:07:11,380 --> 02:07:12,780
And playing it for the first time.

3250
02:07:12,980 --> 02:07:13,720
A lot of fun.

3251
02:07:13,860 --> 02:07:14,780
A lot of fun guys.

3252
02:07:15,200 --> 02:07:17,940
Especially taking some sets off of it.

3253
02:07:17,940 --> 02:07:19,780
I got the fucking, quote unquote.

3254
02:07:20,560 --> 02:07:21,600
Not pros, sorry!

3255
02:07:21,720 --> 02:07:25,000
Quote unquote the good players of my dragoons.

3256
02:07:27,900 --> 02:07:30,800
You should be ashamed if I took a set off you!

3257
02:07:31,080 --> 02:07:32,140
You should be ashamed!

3258
02:07:35,940 --> 02:07:38,900
Alright guys, so for those who are new here.

3259
02:07:39,020 --> 02:07:40,700
The reason why I'm playing Tekken 8.

3260
02:07:41,860 --> 02:07:45,760
Is because I got invited to do Sajan Slam 2.

3261
02:07:45,760 --> 02:07:45,960
Two!

3262
02:07:46,360 --> 02:07:50,840
So obviously I'm a noob so I'll be put in the noob category with everybody else.

3263
02:07:51,140 --> 02:07:58,260
So like noobs will be fighting other noobs and that's why I'm learning a character that a noob might have difficulty with.

3264
02:07:58,540 --> 02:07:59,020
So...

3265
02:08:01,820 --> 02:08:04,180
Which is not King, it's Eddie.

3266
02:08:04,380 --> 02:08:04,940
Guys.

3267
02:08:05,380 --> 02:08:07,660
I'm talking about Eddie, not King.

3268
02:08:08,220 --> 02:08:08,780
Um...

3269
02:08:09,500 --> 02:08:10,060
Anyway.

3270
02:08:10,520 --> 02:08:11,080
Um...

3271
02:08:11,080 --> 02:08:12,580
Who's my trainer and coach?

3272
02:08:12,700 --> 02:08:13,160
I don't know!

3273
02:08:13,420 --> 02:08:13,920
I don't know.

3274
02:08:13,920 --> 02:08:14,820
I'm just waiting for...

3275
02:08:14,820 --> 02:08:19,940
Apparently this was the stream for them to figure out how they're gonna balance it.

3276
02:08:20,080 --> 02:08:21,900
So like I hope that I look really bad.

3277
02:08:22,100 --> 02:08:22,400
So I...

3278
02:08:24,320 --> 02:08:25,420
I'm a new player!

3279
02:08:26,040 --> 02:08:27,040
I'm a new player.

3280
02:08:27,140 --> 02:08:28,900
I have no idea what I'm actually doing.

3281
02:08:29,280 --> 02:08:32,340
So like we had to do a stream where like...

3282
02:08:32,340 --> 02:08:36,760
We had to do at least an hour stream so they can gauge our skill level.

3283
02:08:37,080 --> 02:08:39,580
So by the way, I'm a new player.

3284
02:08:39,700 --> 02:08:42,400
Please treat me as a new player.

3285
02:08:42,840 --> 02:08:43,320
Hahaha.

3286
02:08:45,100 --> 02:08:46,300
I'm so bad.

3287
02:08:47,280 --> 02:08:49,020
I can only go up.

3288
02:08:49,560 --> 02:08:50,960
I'm at rock bottom.

3289
02:08:51,300 --> 02:08:51,960
Anyway guys.

3290
02:08:52,100 --> 02:08:56,900
As always everybody, stay hydrated, posture check, get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

3291
02:08:57,020 --> 02:08:58,700
And if you stay up for me, head to bed.

3292
02:08:58,780 --> 02:08:59,900
Cause you deserve it!

3293
02:09:00,080 --> 02:09:01,120
I'll see you guys next time everybody!

3294
02:09:01,800 --> 02:09:02,520
Bye guys!

3295
02:09:03,360 --> 02:09:03,800
Bye!
