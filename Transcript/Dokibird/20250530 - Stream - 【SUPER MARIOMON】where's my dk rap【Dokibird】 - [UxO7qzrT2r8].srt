1
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:50,310
Hello, everybody!

2
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:52,190
Hello, hello!

3
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:55,550
Oh, I'm just... I'm already a little tired.

4
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:58,210
I had a long day today.

5
00:01:58,630 --> 00:01:59,070
Yes!

6
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:00,170
Oh, man.

7
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:03,310
Um, I haven't had my haircut done in a long time.

8
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:04,430
And I was busy.

9
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:06,390
I knew I was, like, gonna be really busy.

10
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:14,070
Um, I was gonna... I was... I was gonna be really busy the last couple of days because I wanted to get it early on Sunday because I was like, you know, Sunday's my rest day.

11
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:18,350
Usually I get stuff, like, things I want to do to treat myself on Sunday.

12
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:25,230
But then, like, um, the hair salon was, like, fully... The hair salon I liked to go was fully booked and everything.

13
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:27,530
On Sunday!

14
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:28,990
So I was like, Monday!

15
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:30,970
And then it was also fully booked.

16
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:33,330
Today I was like, I'll take anything.

17
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:40,570
I was like, I'll take anything.

18
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:42,830
And they're like, what about Thursday?

19
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,230
And I was like, yay, Thursday!

20
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:45,750
Yay!

21
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:52,310
Um, so yeah, I haven't gone to the hair salon in a long time because I got really lazy.

22
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:55,970
Um, you know, because it's, like, I'm always inside.

23
00:02:55,970 --> 00:03:01,270
I don't... I don't really have to worry about getting my hair cut because I'm always inside.

24
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:07,730
But then... And also, like, for women, hair salons are, like, really, really fucking expensive, too.

25
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:10,010
And they also take forever.

26
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:16,230
So, like, usually when I go to the hair salon, it's when I need to, like, um, retouch my roots.

27
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:21,330
Um, it's when I, like, retouch the roots, uh, for... to dye my hair.

28
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:25,990
And then, you know, since I'm dyeing my hair anyway, um, I might as well cut my hair as well.

29
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:29,690
So, you know, get, like, you get two things done at the same time.

30
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:37,970
So, um, for those who don't know, uh, the reason why I dye my hair, um, is because, um, since I...

31
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:42,250
My parents, uh, I use, like, I don't... I don't... I use, like, the expensive hair dyes, too.

32
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,930
Um, so my hair is a little healthier.

33
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:47,190
Like, you know?

34
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:50,210
I use the expensive hair dyes.

35
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:52,770
Like, I ask to get, like, the, you know, the healthier ones.

36
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:55,890
So that it doesn't ruin your hair as easily.

37
00:03:55,890 --> 00:04:01,470
Because I've been dyeing... My parents have been taking me, um, to dye my hair since I was a child.

38
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:04,910
Since I was, like, I think, like, eight, I think.

39
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:07,770
Um, since I was eight, I've been dyeing my hair.

40
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:15,710
Because I have a genetic defect where, um, uh, my hair, uh, my hair cannot...

41
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:18,790
Uh, my hair sometimes run out of color.

42
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:21,590
When, um, sometimes run out of color.

43
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:23,990
So, like, you know, it's like a printer.

44
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:31,990
So, it starts printing color and then it starts printing black and white ink because it runs out of like color ink.

45
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,030
So, like the pigment.

46
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:33,330
Yeah.

47
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:36,610
So, it's not like I have like white hair.

48
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:39,730
But it's like it will start growing black hair.

49
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:45,190
And then like at the end of the... and then like then it will suddenly turn into white hair.

50
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:52,750
And then... So, so like there's just not enough like black hair.

51
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:57,890
There's not enough black ink in my body for my pigments.

52
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:00,830
So, I have like this little genetic defect that does that.

53
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:04,150
So, this has been happening since I was a little kid.

54
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:05,070
Not since I was eight.

55
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:06,370
It was even like when I was younger.

56
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:10,210
Like maybe when I, you know, I just... it's been happening since I was a little kid.

57
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:14,010
So, so my parents, my mom was like I don't like that.

58
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:22,130
I want my child to look like a freak, cause like, you know, white hair is more noticeable on black hair.

59
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:24,470
So then my mom was like, I don't like that.

60
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:28,510
So then, that's when I started getting my hair dyed.

61
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:33,910
Because, you know, cause like, they wanted me to be a normal child.

62
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:47,650
So then, like, obviously, you know, so I've been getting my hair dyed since then.

63
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:54,610
And it was that time where I had to re-dye my hair, because like, my roots were showing a lot.

64
00:05:54,850 --> 00:06:00,210
And then, because I don't get like, black, I get like, I get like, lighter colors.

65
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:05,010
And, um, I had to re-dye, and I was like, also my hair was getting like, really, really long.

66
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:10,090
So I was like, well, time to chop off half that hair, because it's summertime.

67
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:14,890
And that, and then it gets really, really hot during the summer.

68
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:17,710
So I had to like, chop off the hair.

69
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:23,750
And then like, you know, last time, I think like, the last time I went to the hair salon was like, mm, I don't remember.

70
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:27,350
It was like, I think it was like, November, November.

71
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:33,950
It was like around November that it was the last time I got my hair cut.

72
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:39,690
And so obviously it was time to do it again.

73
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:41,270
All over again.

74
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:43,950
Yeah.

75
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:49,090
So I was like, well, time to pay a couple of hundred dollars.

76
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:51,510
Yippee!

77
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:55,670
And that's why I don't visit the salon very often.

78
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:59,330
And also I have to sit there for three plus hours.

79
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:05,970
And I don't talk to the stylist because I'm not into that.

80
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:09,690
I don't like it when they talk to me.

81
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:17,730
I just look at my phone and just like... I just look at my phone and like just get my work done.

82
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:21,290
Yes, for those who don't know, for the men out there.

83
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:22,470
Um...

84
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:29,550
I know you guys, you just sit on your chair and then 15 minutes later, it's done.

85
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:36,890
For me, as a woman, I sit on the chair.

86
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:44,690
We discuss what we want to do for like 5 to 10 minutes while you guys are like done with your haircut.

87
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:45,550
I...

88
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:47,250
I...

89
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:51,490
We sit on a chair for like 5 to 10 minutes.

90
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,650
And then, um...

91
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:55,210
And then they're like, do you want it layered?

92
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:56,210
Oh, what?

93
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,890
How do you want to style it?

94
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:59,610
You were like, okay, how short?

95
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:01,830
Okay, what do you want to do with the side bangs?

96
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:08,290
And then at that point, I was like, you know, I don't really care as much.

97
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:11,090
I just go like, um...

98
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,710
What do you think looks best?

99
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:15,750
And then I'd be, and they're like, oh, we should do this and that.

100
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:16,970
And then this.

101
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:18,490
And I'm like, cool.

102
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:19,790
Okay, we'll do that.

103
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:22,190
And now, and I would say, yes, get it layered.

104
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:24,710
Because I'm like, if I'm paying for an expensive...

105
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:25,970
Fucking haircut.

106
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:28,530
Like, I might as well...

107
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:30,130
Get it layered.

108
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:31,730
Because they don't add on to that.

109
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:32,890
Like, I'm like...

110
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:35,450
Well, I would not say no to getting it layered.

111
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:37,830
Because it's like a base price.

112
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:38,810
And then...

113
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:41,370
It's a base price for cuts.

114
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:43,470
So I was like, I might as well get it layered.

115
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:46,150
Because I'm already paying for an expensive haircut.

116
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:48,710
Most of the money is on the hair dye, by the way.

117
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:50,110
The hair dye...

118
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:51,690
Was a lot.

119
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:55,730
The haircut was not expensive as the hair dye.

120
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:04,200
And then so like, after that, I sat on a chair for an hour...

121
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:10,070
Almost an hour and a half of her putting hair dye in my hair.

122
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:14,030
And like, that was like an hour and a half of my time.

123
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:14,730
That...

124
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:16,950
I just...

125
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:18,310
Sat there...

126
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:21,330
For an hour and a half while she was putting all the dye in my head.

127
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:22,370
And then...

128
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:23,180
And then after that...

129
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:24,670
Um...

130
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:25,220
After that...

131
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:26,490
Um...

132
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:27,630
Shampooing it.

133
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,210
Like, and I have to wait even more.

134
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:29,930
After...

135
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:31,770
You know, I have to wait like 30 plus minutes.

136
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:34,070
After the hair dye was fully...

137
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:36,190
To wait for the hair dye to fully set in.

138
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,710
And then it's like...

139
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:38,630
Shampoo time!

140
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:39,370
Yay!

141
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:42,150
And that was another 15 to 20 minutes.

142
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:44,970
Of her like, you know, massaging my head.

143
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:45,890
And...

144
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:48,110
I mean...

145
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:51,930
Massaging my head and putting like two to three products on my hair.

146
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:53,630
And then after that...

147
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:56,650
We finally got to the cutting portion.

148
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:04,740
Then we get to the cutting portion.

149
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:06,480
And I have a lot of hair.

150
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,540
I grow hair really, really fast.

151
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:11,780
So like, I always have to like ask them to like...

152
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:12,300
Um...

153
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:12,800
Trim it.

154
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,320
So that it's like...

155
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:14,900
Lighten...

156
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:15,580
Oh, I like...

157
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,580
To make it less heavy.

158
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,680
So I'll be like...

159
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,760
Oh, can you like...

160
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,000
Lighten it up?

161
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:20,920
Why did they...

162
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:21,680
Don't they cut...

163
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:21,880
No!

164
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:22,780
Because...

165
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:23,420
Because...

166
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,800
That's a waste...

167
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,560
Oh wait...

168
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,180
Why don't they...

169
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:27,180
Because...

170
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:27,880
Um...

171
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,460
Because they want to make sure...

172
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:30,320
It like...

173
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,240
It like...

174
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:32,140
Um...

175
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:33,900
Sets everywhere or some sh...

176
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:34,960
I don't fucking know.

177
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,740
I...

178
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,800
No one make sure it sets everywhere...

179
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,660
Everywhere I guess.

180
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:43,820
I don't fucking know why they don't...

181
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:44,120
Uh...

182
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,360
Don't cut first.

183
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:46,280
Um...

184
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:46,720
Anyway...

185
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,360
I'm not a fucking hair stylist.

186
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:49,760
I don't fucking know.

187
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:50,560
I...

188
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,160
I...

189
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,000
Um...

190
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,720
Anyway...

191
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,660
And then after that...

192
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:58,320
Then...

193
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,720
They cut my hair!

194
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,860
And then they have to blow dry and style it.

195
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,700
And then that was like...

196
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,620
Almost $200.

197
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:06,720
That...

198
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:07,840
No...

199
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,640
Actually it was like...

200
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,120
With tax it was more than $200.

201
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,100
It was...

202
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,060
It was more than $200.

203
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:14,020
And that's why I go to the hair salon...

204
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:16,080
Every couple of months...

205
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:16,520
Later.

206
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:17,840
When I need to.

207
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:21,240
That's why...

208
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,760
When my hair gets too long...

209
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,280
I go to the hair salon.

210
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,100
And then that is the correct time...

211
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,940
For me to re-dye my hair as well.

212
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:29,860
Um...

213
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:30,520
God...

214
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,280
Being a girl...

215
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:33,420
Expensive.

216
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,900
It's because the hair dye I use...

217
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,460
Is also like...

218
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:38,740
Healthier hair dye.

219
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:39,560
So like...

220
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,140
It's not like the cheap hair dye...

221
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:41,960
Where it could like...

222
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:42,540
Hurt your hair.

223
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:43,460
Um...

224
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:44,300
It's the more expensive...

225
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:45,600
Dye.

226
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:46,340
So that...

227
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,740
It doesn't ruin your hair.

228
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:48,920
Even if you like...

229
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:49,160
You know...

230
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,000
If you're like...

231
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,760
Especially me...

232
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,440
Cause I have to dye my hair every so often.

233
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:53,120
Uh...

234
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,520
Ooh la la...

235
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,320
Dad gets fancy food.

236
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,160
I get...

237
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,780
Fancy mandatory haircuts.

238
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:02,000
I don't even want to be there for.

239
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,160
Ooh la la...

240
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:09,700
Yeah...

241
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:12,160
If you want quality...

242
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:12,700
You got...

243
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,500
You gotta pay...

244
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,280
Um...

245
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,100
It's not mandatory though.

246
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,020
Well...

247
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:24,460
It is sort of, because, you know, I don't want to ruin my hair.

248
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:30,160
And also, like, you'll find out why I had to get, like, my hair cut, too.

249
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:34,220
You know when I said, like, I have an announcement next week?

250
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,040
The announcement got moved up in two days.

251
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,540
So you'll find out on Saturday why...

252
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:46,260
You'll find out.

253
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:50,060
Yeah, I dropped this on Mario Mon when nobody's really here.

254
00:12:52,580 --> 00:13:00,300
Sex to those dragoons who don't have... Sex to those dragoons who didn't catch the Mario Mon stream.

255
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,780
The part six of Mario Mon.

256
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:07,980
I always drop the most important stuff, like, in the most obscure streams.

257
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:13,080
I... That's on them.

258
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:19,240
It's a random part six of Mario Mon.

259
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,960
But in two days, you'll find out what the special announcement is.

260
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:30,580
Instead of next week, I was told, like, yesterday night, that I was like, oh, yeah, announcement's on the 31st.

261
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,720
And I was like, oh, shit, that's really sad.

262
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,380
But you'll find out.

263
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:39,980
You can go and do your guesses if you want to.

264
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,800
But I'm not going to tell you what it is.

265
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:45,540
Um...

266
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:47,960

And no, I was literally just on my phone doing work stuff.

272
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,080
My manager was like, did you sign a contract?

273
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,260
And I was like, no, I'm on my phone.

274
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:01,720
At the hair salon.

275
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,200
And my manager was like, oh.

276
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:07,280

277
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,540
And I was like, okay.

Did you read the contract I'm gonna sign it!

287
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:41,740
Alright, so that was mostly my day for today.

288
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,240
Alright, dad update.

289
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,680
The usual dad update.

290
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,780
So dad's been a little shit lately.

291
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:51,140
I say while he's like right next to me sleeping.

292
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:59,320
So, okay, so you guys remember that story of the time dad fell in love with a lady owner?

293
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:08,020
And how I tried to make him leave the dog park.

294
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:17,120
And when I made him leave the dog park, he sat there looking out the door being like, oh, I want to see her.

295
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,800
Please, don't let me leave.

296
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,080
I want to see her.

297
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:28,420
Remember that time when I was like, yeah, I've never had him like that obsessed before.

298
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:34,180
Where he had, he like sat at the door looking out in the glass, wanting to go back outside.

299
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:35,720
Um, anyway.

300
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,460
Anyway, we saw her again last night.

301
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,740
Or not last night, night.

302
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:47,720
Um, after the, uh, night rain stream, you know, I took him for the walk at the dog park.

303
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:52,700
And then, so I was at the dog park for like more than 30 minutes.

304
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:55,540
But he, cause he refused to poop.

305
00:15:55,700 --> 00:16:00,520
Because all he wanted to do was spend time with the pretty lady.

306
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:06,580
Cause like he like instantly like ran to her and was like, yeah, I missed you.

307
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,960
Oh my God, I thought I'd never see you again.

308
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:15,780
And he actually like rolled on his back for belly rubs to her.

309
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,620
Like instantly.

310
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:19,520
He's like, oh my God, it's been so long.

311
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:22,700
I thought I'd never see you again.

312
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,980
Please rub my belly.

313
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:27,360
Touch me.

314
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:35,100
And then I literally had to sit on the bench and just like watch her like pet him.

315
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:40,340
And have him, and him following her around for like 30 plus minutes.

316
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,580
And then the lady was like, oh, come on.

317
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,340
You go poop and then I'll pet you more.

318
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,520
And he like refused to like leave her side.

319
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,500
And at that point, I gave up.

320
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,380
Because I was like, I have things to do.

321
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:55,180
And I was no...

322
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:58,580
I, look, I just sat on the bench on my phone.

323
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,980
Because I knew it was gonna be a while.

324
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,240
And I was not gonna bother with that.

325
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:11,880
I was like, alright, I guess if he's gonna do this, at least let me be productive.

326
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,820
And do stuff on my phone.

327
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:15,680
Do my work stuff.

328
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:18,360
Because he's gonna be there for a while.

329
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:22,500
So I thought, you know, he's gonna poop in those 30 plus minutes.

330
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,560
Because I was like, you know what?

331
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,780
I have some time to spare.

332
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:27,840
To like, um, to be at the dog park.

333
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:28,860
I have time to spare.

334
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,600
And just like, wait for him.

335
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:34,000
To like, finish, you know, with the pretty lady.

336
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,100
And then, you know, do his business.

337
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,240
And then we could leave.

338
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,860
But, 30 plus minutes passed.

339
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,220
And he was still following her around.

340
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,440
Begging her to touch him.

341
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,640
And then, at that point, I was like, okay.

342
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:52,200
I didn't realize it was gonna, he was gonna still do this.

343
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,500
Because I don't have a lot of time in my schedule.

344
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,640
I, I just, I wanted to treat him a little bit.

345
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,240
To have some fun times.

346
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:06,200
But, like, this fun times was taking way too long.

347
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:13,340
Like, at one point, a giant, like, he came back to me.

348
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:18,660
Because he was like, he was like, hey, do you wanna pet me?

349
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,860
I see you by yourself.

350
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:24,260
Doki, do you wanna pet me too?

351
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:28,940
And then, this big dog walked over to us.

352
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,020
And, like, started sniffing dad.

353
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,820
And dad was not happy about that.

354
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,500
Because he hates giant dogs.

355
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:38,400
He hates, he hates dogs that are bigger than him.

356
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,020
Because, I don't know, I guess he wants to be the biggest dog.

357
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:43,480
And so, he's like, what is this abomination?

358
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,460
Like, how dare you be bigger than me?

359
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:51,900
So that, you know, he gave the big dog a false...

360
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:52,980
Except for that white dog.

361
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,580
Except for that one white dog that likes to lick his ears.

362
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,760
He hates every other big dog.

363
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,160
Anyway.

364
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,160
Um.

365
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:01,380
Um.

366
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,920
So, like, this other...

367
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:03,640
It was like a poodle.

368
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,160
Like, I don't know.

369
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:05,340
He just fucking hates poodles.

370
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:05,940
I don't know.

371
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,900
Like, but, and there's a lot of poodles.

372
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:11,660
I asked my friend, like, why do people love owning those, like, giant poodles?

373
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,560
Like, those, like, poodle terrier dogs.

374
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,680
And, like, the min...

375
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,780
You know, the mini poodle terrier dogs.

376
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,360
And then the big poodle terrier dogs.

377
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,420
Not, like, the poodle poodle, but the poodle terriers.

378
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,240
And then I was like, oh, man.

379
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,680
Like, I don't understand.

380
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:24,660
Like, I don't know.

381
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:24,980
I don't...

382
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,880
I personally don't think they're that pretty.

383
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,820
But, like, apparently they don't shed as much.

384
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:30,740
That's why.

385
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:32,080
Yeah, they don't shed that much.

386
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:34,640
But I personally don't find them that pretty.

387
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:56,460
Anyway, the big ones walked up to dad and then, you know, dad gave him a false sense of security and let him get close and the moment he got near his face, he was like... And then it scared the shit out of the big dog that he actually fell backwards.

388
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,880
And ran away.

389
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,900
He actually fell backwards on his ass and ran away.

390
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,780
Because it, like, freaked him out.

391
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:09,280
And then dad just looked at me and was like, yeah, that's right, bitch.

392
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:19,540
Like, he did one giant fart at the big dog and then looked back at me as if nothing was to happen.

393
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:25,740
And then...

394
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:31,680
Anyway.

395
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:33,060
Anyway.

396
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,400
Yeah, and then the big dog ran away like a little bitch.

397
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,820
Back to his owner because he was like, what the fuck happened?

398
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:44,800
Anyway.

399
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:47,240
So, I was like, alright.

400
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:48,300
Time's up.

401
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,020
You're not...

402
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,260
You're not gonna poop.

403
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:53,300
I'm just gonna head back to my apartment.

404
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:58,180
So, the thing about this dog part is that it's sort of connected to my building.

405
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:01,540
So, you can, like, go there by going through my building.

406
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:03,440
We still have to walk a little bit there.

407
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:06,880
So, like, you know, I walked out and then headed to the...

408
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,760
Headed to my building.

409
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,200
And walked through the hallway of my building.

410
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:16,940
And this little fuckhead, when we got to the hallway, pooped in the middle of the hallway.

411
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,580
Because he was like, oh, wait.

412
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,140
I was supposed to poop.

413
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:28,000
And I was like, are you fucking kidding me?

414
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:32,520
I was like, you had so much time.

415
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,380
And you're like, oh, you know what?

416
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,300
Oh, you're right.

417
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,400
I should have pooped.

418
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,340
Well, I might as well poop now.

419
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:41,920
And then I...

420
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,200
Oh, my God.

421
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:46,120
I was like, oh, my God.

422
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:47,600
Why?

423
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,320
I was like, why?

424
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,520
You had so much time.

425
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,680
It's like, well, he's like, lady gone.

426
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,920
Might as well poop here now.

427
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,760
Like...

428
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:05,200
And then, so I had to like, you know, it was so embarrassing.

429
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,540
Because like, okay, I got really scared.

430
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:17,820
Because, you know, my apartment building has like, a rule where obviously if they find out that you poop inside the building, I get fined $50.

431
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:27,820
So I was like, I like quickly picked it up and like, I quickly picked it up and like, walked back to the dog park to throw the poop away.

432
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:31,360
And then, lad got really happy.

433
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:34,900
He was like, I get to see her again!

434
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:35,860
Yay!

435
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:41,180
Because he saw me turn around back to the dog park.

436
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:43,160
And he was like, yay!

437
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:43,240
Yay!

438
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,500
I'll get to see her again!

439
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,240
I am...

440
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:53,220
All part of the plan.

441
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:54,880
And then, yeah.

442
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:55,860
And then I...

443
00:22:55,860 --> 00:23:00,580
And then like, at that point, the lady was actually about to leave when I threw away the poop.

444
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,020
And he's like, that's alright!

445
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:03,960
Oh, you're leaving too?

446
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:04,880
Yay!

447
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:07,780
And then like, she actually lived in my building too.

448
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,620
So she was like, oh, oh, oh, hey, I hear you're like...

449
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:14,600
But then the thing is, she has to do the other elevator.

450
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:16,160
So like, the right...

451
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,720
So like, the elevator is divided between floors.

452
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,140
So she was on a different floor than me.

453
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:25,960
So then, dad tried to follow her to the different elevator.

454
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,940
And he was like, come on!

455
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:31,690
Why are you like, come on?

456
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:33,050
I was like, come back!

457
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:33,930
I was like, no!

458
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:34,730
No!

459
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:38,110
And I had to pick him up because he refused to leave that elevator.

460
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:41,750
He was like, but she's going to this elevator.

461
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:48,430
And I was like, get out!

462
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:52,570
You're not following her home!

463
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:56,650
And he's like, no!

464
00:23:57,210 --> 00:24:00,190
I want to be in this elevator!

465
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:06,550
And he knows he's in the wrong elevator.

466
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:10,350
Because he knows, like, which one, which side is the correct one.

467
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:13,370
Because it's like, like, one side's left and the other side's right.

468
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:16,370
And he's never gone on the other side before.

469
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:18,910
So he knows it's the wrong elevator.

470
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:20,670
He's not stupid.

471
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:22,850
Like...

472
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:25,510
Oh, thank you for the super chat.

473
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:26,630
Thank you, thank you.

474
00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:27,970
It's okay.

475
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:29,750
We all know how you feel.

476
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:32,550
Boy, thank you for the super chat.

477
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:33,330
Thank you, thank you.

478
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:33,970
Obscure, yes.

479
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:36,730
And all while doing while wearing a Mario cap and massage.

480
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:37,610
Thank you for the super chat.

481
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:38,330
Thank you, thank you.

482
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:39,790
Dominic, thank you for the super chat.

483
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:40,650
Thank you, thank you.

484
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:41,510
Hey, Dinklebird.

485
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:42,590
I want to wish you a good stream.

486
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:43,570
Thank you for the super chat.

487
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:44,550
Thank you, thank you.

488
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:46,750
Not so Deadpool.

489
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:47,950
Thank you for the super chat.

490
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:48,910
Thank you, thank you.

491
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:51,350
Are you sure he's not part of Shih Tzu?

492
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:55,730
Oh my god, no, he's a purebred wiener dog.

493
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:59,110
Acting like a real weenie right now.

494
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:02,070
Duck, thank you for the super chat.

495
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:02,910
Thank you, thank you.

496
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:05,830
Got pet by a pretty lady like a boss.

497
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:08,530
Bullied a big dog like a boss.

498
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:11,910
Took a dump in the hallway like a boss.

499
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:15,550
Saw the pretty lady again like a boss.

500
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:24,830
Anyway, that's the dad update.

501
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:26,810
Final update.

502
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:29,590
I finally have my third monitor installed.

503
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:35,350
That's why you see me looking to the right again because the third monitor is finally installed.

504
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:41,850
It is double the size of my main two monitors because my main two monitors are the same monitor.

505
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:44,510
And then my third monitor is the one that MSI sent me.

506
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:46,390
And then it is double the size.

507
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:51,290
It took... I'll show you guys a picture of it later because I need like sensor stuff, obviously.

508
00:25:52,870 --> 00:26:01,830
But like I showed a picture of it to like my manager because my manager was like, Oh, did you install your... finally install your third monitor?

509
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:03,630
Because they're planning on sending you another one later.

510
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:04,710
And I was like, yeah.

511
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:08,910
It like took me like three bricks to get it fully installed.

512
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:11,470
Yeah, it's the... I think it's the 32 inches one.

513
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:14,310
The one... whichever one I did Doki bite on.

514
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:17,350
Um, the one that's 240 Hertz.

515
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:19,810
Uh, the one... anyway.

516
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:24,030
Um, so like, you know, I... I got the electric screwdriver.

517
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:25,050
It works guys!

518
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:26,890
The electric screwdriver works!

519
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:29,250
Uh...

520
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:34,590
So like, obviously my manager was trying to like teach me how to do it.

521
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:37,950
Because like, um, because I was like really confused.

522
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:41,170
And then he was like telling me like, oh yeah.

523
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:47,770
So like, a normal person would, you know, um, unscrew the PC arm.

524
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:48,790
The monitor arm.

525
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:50,410
And then put it on the ground.

526
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:53,970
And then you can use that to like, unscrew it.

527
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:55,130
So, you know.

528
00:26:57,630 --> 00:26:59,870
That's what a normal person would do.

529
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:02,690
And I was like, I didn't do that.

530
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:03,030
I...

531
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:07,830
I...

532
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:09,090
Uh...

533
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:10,110
Um...

534
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:11,550
I didn't do that.

535
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:13,770
Instead, what I did.

536
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:15,490
I held the monitor.

537
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:16,830
And then went...

538
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:25,590
I didn't want to also deal with a monitor arm.

539
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:26,850
So I...

540
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:27,970
I was like...

541
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:32,850
And then obviously I had to like hold it up too.

542
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:34,550
So that it won't like collapse.

543
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:38,950
And then, you know, um...

544
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:40,190
Held it up.

545
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:42,470
And then, you know, put it away.

546
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:45,610
And then I went to my bed and laid down for a sec.

547
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:47,590
Laid down for like 5 to 10 minutes.

548
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:48,470
And...

549
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:55,890
And then I laid down for like...

550
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:57,470
10 to 15 minutes.

551
00:27:57,630 --> 00:27:58,090
More like.

552
00:27:58,430 --> 00:28:00,030
For 10 to 15 minutes.

553
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:03,590
And then I unpacked my 32 inch monitor.

554
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:05,050
Um...

555
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:06,790
My 32 inch monitor.

556
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:08,010
And was like...

557
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:08,270
Alright!

558
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:10,910
Now time to unpack...

559
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:12,810
Open it for the first time.

560
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:13,870
And...

561
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:14,490
Uh...

562
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:15,630
Bring it over...

563
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:17,010
To the...

564
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:17,730
To the...

565
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:18,850
You know, PC mod...

566
00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:19,790
Like the PC arm.

567
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:20,670
The monitor arm.

568
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:21,570
And then...

569
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:22,730
So, you know, I brought it over.

570
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:24,010
It was pretty fucking heavy.

571
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:25,170
Um...

572
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:26,190
And then...

573
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:27,170
And then I realized...

574
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:28,170
Oh!

575
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:30,270
That's what my manager meant when...

576
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:31,490
When he said...

577
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:32,490
A normal person...

578
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:33,410
Would...

579
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:33,790
Take...

580
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:34,310
The...

581
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:35,350
Monitor arm down.

582
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:37,090
And put it on the floor.

583
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:39,590
Because it'd be easier to put it on...

584
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:40,090
Hahahaha!

585
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,920
I was like...

586
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:45,420
Oh!

587
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:46,340
I see why...

588
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:48,400
He told me to do...

589
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,320
What a normal person would do.

590
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:52,400
And why it'd be easier.

591
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:53,560
Anyway!

592
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,340
So I didn't do that.

593
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,800
So instead...

594
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,280
I...

595
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,380
Put the monitor...

596
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:59,400
At my desk.

597
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,520
And then I went back to my bed.

598
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:04,140
And laid down for another 10 to 15 minutes.

599
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:05,300
Uh...

600
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:06,280
Hahahaha!

601
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:08,000
Hahahaha!

602
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:08,900
Also...

603
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:10,160
Thank you for the super chat.

604
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:10,520
Thank you.

605
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,960
It's my first time catching the stream.

606
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:13,480
Who is that?

607
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:14,740
Doki Amber Doge.

608
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:15,440
That's my dog.

609
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,600
He's a wiener dog.

610
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:17,080
I call...

611
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,820
I named it after myself.

612
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,420
Because I'm an egomaniac.

613
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,420
And so...

614
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:22,560
But it gets a little confusing.

615
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,260
When his name is also Doki.

616
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,380
So I call him Doki Amber Doge.

617
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:27,640
So in short form...

618
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,060
It's dad.

619
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:28,800
Anyway!

620
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:29,820
Anyway!

621
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:31,640
So...

622
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:33,220
So...

623
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:33,560
Um...

624
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:35,820
Second break time is over.

625
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,380
So I like...

626
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:39,500
Obviously I had to hold up...

627
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:40,380
The monitor.

628
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,200
And then like...

629
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:42,740
You know...

630
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:44,080
Trying to align it.

631
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:45,560
Holding the monitor up.

632
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,560
By the way...

633
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,180
Vertically!

634
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:48,380
Hahahaha!

635
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:49,800
Hahahaha!

636
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:50,940
Hahahaha!

637
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:51,400
The monitor.

638
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,200
Because I couldn't...

639
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,580
Rotate the arm.

640
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,700
So that it was horizontal.

641
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:57,780
So...

642
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:58,480
Vertically!

643
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,120
Trying to hold up...

644
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,060
The 32 inches monitor.

645
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:03,740
Aligning it...

646
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:04,420
On the...

647
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:05,240
Screw area.

648
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,100
And then was like...

649
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,120
Struggling a little bit.

650
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:09,200
Because it was very heavy.

651
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,100
Hahahaha!

652
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:11,240
Hahahaha!

653
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:11,660
Vertically!

654
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,860
Trying to hold it against it.

655
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:15,340
And then like...

656
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:15,940
Okay, you know what?

657
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:16,200
I'll...

658
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:16,940
Do an art.

659
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:18,100
I'll like...

660
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:18,780
Draw it out too.

661
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:19,500
For you guys.

662
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,800
So you guys know how...

663
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,080
How silly I was.

664
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:23,620
Hahahaha!

665
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:25,680
Hahahaha!

666
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:26,360
Hahahaha!

667
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:29,210
Hahahaha!

668
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:29,570
And then...

669
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:30,770
Okay.

670
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:31,790
And then there's...

671
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:32,790
Me...

672
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:33,710
Being like...

673
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:35,250
Hahahaha!

674
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:37,530
Hahahaha!

675
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:38,110
Hahahaha!

676
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:39,590
Hahahaha!

677
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:40,010
Hahahaha!

678
00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:40,130
Hahahaha!

679
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:41,630
And then...

680
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:43,750
And I also have to be here too.

681
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:45,170
And like...

682
00:30:45,170 --> 00:30:46,150
Holding it as well.

683
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:57,870
Mia 1, Mia 2, and then these, okay, you'll know what I mean.

684
00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:00,310
And then these are my two other monitors.

685
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:01,970
The size comparison.

686
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:03,390
Alright, anyway.

687
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:12,910
Alright, so I sketched it out and then... Alright, let me save this real quick so you guys can see.

688
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:16,130
Okay, it looks a little confusing because I draw both versions of it.

689
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:17,150
me in the same picture.

690
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:21,730
So, to be like... Alright, so I drew both versions of myself.

691
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:24,890
So, this is like... This is the monitor I'm holding.

692
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:27,030
So, this is the arm right here.

693
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:30,170
Like, um... Let me give you a mini cursor.

694
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:35,330
Um... I'll give you... Whoa!

695
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:37,150
Whoops, I dropped my controller.

696
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:38,730
I'm a little bit of a mess.

697
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:39,350
Alright.

698
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:40,970
I dropped that.

699
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:42,490
Alright, give me a sec.

700
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:44,310
Let me grab a...

701
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:47,230
Uh... Cursor for us.

702
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:47,930
Okay.

703
00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:49,750
I'll use myself as a cursor.

704
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:50,570
Alright.

705
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:57,950
So... So... This is... This is... Right here is the monitor arm.

706
00:31:58,130 --> 00:31:58,590
Right here.

707
00:31:58,810 --> 00:32:00,270
So, you can see this area.

708
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:03,690
Where it's like... The screw... Like, we're at the screw it on.

709
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:05,830
So, this is me holding it up.

710
00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:08,210
Um... Holding it up like this.

711
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:13,310
And... And then... And then... And then... Um... And then be like, Oh, shit!

712
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:14,890
I need to be on this other side.

713
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:16,450
So, that I moved over here.

714
00:32:16,530 --> 00:32:17,810
I'm being like, Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

715
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:18,170
Here.

716
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:20,730
And then... Holding the screwdriver gun.

717
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:26,470
And... Um... The screwdriver... Uh... Electric screwdriver gun.

718
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:30,710
And then, like, holding it up and being, like, AHHHHH!

719
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:33,430
Because all I needed was one screw.

720
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:39,390
All I needed was one screw to, like, to make it work.

721
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:46,830
So that took me, like, maybe, like, five to seven minutes to align that one screw into the hole.

722
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:48,990
And after that, I let go of my hands.

723
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:52,750
That might have been a little silly to do.

724
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:54,610
Maybe a little stupid to do.

725
00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:58,690
Because, like, obviously, you don't know that one screw was gonna hold everything together.

726
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:01,970
But I was tired and I was willing to take the risk.

727
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:14,130
So, I was tired and I was willing to take that risk.

728
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:18,470
And so I let go after the one screw was screwed in.

729
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:19,990
And, um...

730
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:26,470
And then, um...

731
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:28,150
It worked, though.

732
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:28,750
It worked.

733
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:32,210
And I had to find, obviously, I was trying to find the second and the third.

734
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:33,610
So I let go of my arms.

735
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:34,790
I let go of my hands.

736
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:36,470
The moment that one screw was over.

737
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:39,910
Because I was like, oh, thank God, I don't have to carry the minor anymore.

738
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:43,710
I can't carry it anymore.

739
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:46,350
And then I was like, oh, thank God, it's over.

740
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:49,990
And then, and then, obviously, I had to, like, get...

741
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:50,930
I was trying to find the...

742
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:53,830
How the second screw to put it in and go...

743
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:54,890
And then the third, fourth.

744
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:55,830
And then it was done.

745
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:57,590
And then everything went okay.

746
00:33:57,850 --> 00:33:59,690
A lot of things could have gone wrong.

747
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:01,110
But luckily, nothing did.

748
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:07,190
YOLO, am I right?

749
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:09,090
YOLO!

750
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:10,690
Um...

751
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:12,470

Hey, Doki, today is my birthday.

754
00:34:15,490 --> 00:34:16,310
Can I get a...

755
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:17,210
Can I get a happy birthday?

756
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:18,030
Of course you can!

757
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:20,130

758
00:34:20,430 --> 00:34:22,170

00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:42,710

768
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:45,190

Thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

774
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:06,570
Hey guys, I saved money.

775
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:16,190
Instead of hiring a handyman, I was a sort of handy woman today, or not today, but like yesterday.

776
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:18,130
I was sort of handy.

777
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:24,270
My third monitor is up and running now.

778
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:27,690
Alan, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

779
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:34,170
Alan, I don't believe in God, but knowing you're still alive, being in this shelter makes me believe in one.

780
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:35,810
And he loves you.

781
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:38,730
Thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

782
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:40,110
Look at that.

783
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:42,830
Look at that, guys.

784
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:43,810
I did it.

785
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:46,210
My third, I didn't have to pay extra.

786
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:54,430
I saved that money from hiring a handyman, so I can, so I can waste all of that at the hair salon.

787
00:35:58,830 --> 00:36:00,250
Look at me go.

788
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:04,390
Oh, Johnny, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

789
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:07,030
Now I know where all your luck went.

790
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:10,190
It went to surviving to real life incidents.

791
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:13,690
Thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

792
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:16,210
Grab my controller, I dropped it on the floor.

793
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:19,070
Grab it real quick.

794
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:20,290
Alright.

795
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:25,990
Anyway, so that was my life update for the last couple of days.

796
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:28,070
It's been pretty eventful.

797
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:30,430
Now we're back to Super Mario Man!

798
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:31,890
I don't know how long to play today.

799
00:36:32,530 --> 00:36:35,510
Um, so we'll see how it goes.

800
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:37,770
Uh, no, don't say that.

801
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:39,170
Tokyo time!

802
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:41,230
Oh yeah, I forgot.

803
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:43,030
I have this fucker.

804
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:44,990
With me.

805
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:46,210
Okay, no!

806
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:48,970
Leave me!

807
00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:50,810
Leave me!

808
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:52,530
Wait, how do I get out of here?

809
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:56,730
I don't... Oh my god, stupid.

810
00:36:57,010 --> 00:36:59,850
Oh my god, I forgot he killed my entire team!

811
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:00,630
Hahaha!

812
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:02,510
I forgot!

813
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:06,490
I forgot this guy killed my entire team!

814
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:07,930
Okay, he has to come with me.

815
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:08,610
We need to heal.

816
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:09,990
Hahaha!

817
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:12,970
I almost forgot.

818
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:17,290
That singular jab, he almost killed the entire team.

819
00:37:18,290 --> 00:37:18,890
Alright.

820
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:20,470
Let's go back.

821
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:22,690
Okay, we gotta heal.

822
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:24,550
Alright.

823
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:25,910
Hahaha!

824
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:27,910
Oh yeah, I forgot the Yoshi!

825
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:29,770
Okay, I already forgot the Yoshi.

826
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:30,410
He heals me.

827
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:32,370
Alright, back I'll go.

828
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:35,570
Uh, Mr. Man!

829
00:37:35,850 --> 00:37:37,410
Welcome to the tomato farm!

830
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:38,310
Welcome, welcome!

831
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:40,870
Alright, now you leave me!

832
00:37:41,410 --> 00:37:42,230
Be gone!

833
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:46,230
Be gone, Toad!

834
00:37:47,410 --> 00:37:50,190
Yeah, that Jabby was fucking insane.

835
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:53,570
I might have to... Wait, actually, what...

836
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:56,330
What... What type is he?

837
00:37:56,570 --> 00:37:57,890
That Jabby was crazy.

838
00:37:58,870 --> 00:37:59,170
Okay.

839
00:38:00,290 --> 00:38:00,350
Okay.

840
00:38:00,370 --> 00:38:02,190
Why is he in box 13?

841
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:02,950
Why...

842
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:03,390
Hahaha!

843
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:08,570
What was my plan for him in box 13?

844
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:09,670
Hahaha!

845
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:11,750
I don't...

846
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:14,070
I don't even remember what the plan was.

847
00:38:14,330 --> 00:38:14,610
Haha!

848
00:38:14,850 --> 00:38:15,810
I... I don't even know.

849
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:16,590
I was like, what...

850
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:17,750
Why is he by himself?

851
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:19,470
Alright, summary.

852
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:22,270
Uh, grass and dark.

853
00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:23,670
Okay, what's Jabby?

854
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:24,670
What are you?

855
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:28,230
Bug and fly.

856
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:29,670
Oh, unfortunate.

857
00:38:29,830 --> 00:38:30,490
I already have a fly.

858
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:32,610
What was the other one that fucked me up?

859
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:35,790
There was one more guy that fucked me up.

860
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:37,230
Oh yeah, I remember now.

861
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:40,950
Private X?

862
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:43,190
What was my pla...

863
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:43,830
Hahaha!

864
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:47,970
Guys!

865
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:49,490
Oh!

866
00:38:49,830 --> 00:38:50,130
What...

867
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:51,050
What does the X...

868
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:51,410
Oh!

869
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:52,510
Private...

870
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:52,730
Oh!

871
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:55,130
I remember what Private X was.

872
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:56,010
I...

873
00:38:56,010 --> 00:38:56,510
Hahaha!

874
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:02,650
I'm like rediscovering myself.

875
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:04,830
Uh, yeah, I remember.

876
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:06,330
Now, where's the other guy?

877
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:07,590
Where I was...

878
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:08,030
I left...

879
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:08,790
Oh yeah, this guy.

880
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:09,870
Alright, what's your...

881
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:11,130
What is your...

882
00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:12,530
Grass and dark.

883
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:14,670
God, you...

884
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:15,950
This guy fucked me up too.

885
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:16,750
Hahaha!

886
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:22,030
This guy...

887
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:24,430
This guy fucked me up as well.

888
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:25,090
Hahaha!

889
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:26,030
Alright.

890
00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:28,030
Cause I do have...

891
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:30,930
Grass and dark.

892
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:33,650
Alright, we're gonna put a...

893
00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:36,050
We're gonna put a nudist into my party.

894
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:38,050
This guy was...

895
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:39,290
Alright.

896
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:41,210
Don't worry.

897
00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:41,650
Don't worry.

898
00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:42,610
You don't have to be here.

899
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:44,590
I'll put you here by...

900
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:45,930
Now you live by yourself.

901
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:47,470
And then you go...

902
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:48,310
You go here.

903
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:49,130
Fuck you.

904
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:51,530
I took a loan for those Pokeballs.

905
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:53,110
Alright.

906
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:56,430
Let's see.

907
00:39:57,750 --> 00:39:58,750
What is this?

908
00:39:58,870 --> 00:39:59,630
Wait, what's this?

909
00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:01,250
You're too...

910
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:02,270
Oh my god!

911
00:40:02,270 --> 00:40:04,050
I have to bring you over?!

912
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:04,210
Over!

913
00:40:05,790 --> 00:40:07,250
Audio, thank you for the super chat.

914
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:07,990
Thank you, thank you.

915
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:08,790
Just wanna tell you...

916
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:09,230
Good luck.

917
00:40:09,330 --> 00:40:10,430
We're all counting on you.

918
00:40:11,010 --> 00:40:11,410
Alright.

919
00:40:13,290 --> 00:40:15,310
I have to bring you over, apparently.

920
00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:17,290
Okay.

921
00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:18,690
Baby Koala!

922
00:40:18,830 --> 00:40:19,730
Thank you for the super chat.

923
00:40:19,830 --> 00:40:20,590
Thank you, thank you.

924
00:40:20,890 --> 00:40:22,070
Box Bouncer Doki.

925
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:23,570
Is this good enough to bribe...

926
00:40:23,570 --> 00:40:24,910
To get into a private exit?

927
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:25,850
It's okay if not.

928
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:27,710
Also, it was fun watching you yesterday.

929
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:28,810
Thank you for the super chat.

930
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:29,490
Thank you, thank you.

931
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:30,890
Glad you had so much fun!

932
00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:32,070
Oh my god!

933
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:33,890
Speaking of Night Ring...

934
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:36,270
Um, I actually received my Night Ring...

935
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:38,610
My free Night Ring collector's box today.

936
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:42,890
Um, so like, they basically sent all the streamers who were participating...

937
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:44,690
LET ME IN FRONT!

938
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:45,990
Um, sorry.

939
00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:47,630
Toad wanted to...

940
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:49,010
Toad wanted to have some fun.

941
00:40:52,490 --> 00:40:53,050
Wait.

942
00:40:53,730 --> 00:40:55,230
How is he gonna go in?

943
00:40:56,010 --> 00:40:56,970
Uh, but yeah.

944
00:40:57,130 --> 00:40:57,790
They gave me...

945
00:40:57,790 --> 00:40:58,390
They gave me...

946
00:40:58,390 --> 00:40:58,630
They gave me...

947
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:00,950
They sent over the collector's box and I got it today.

948
00:41:02,330 --> 00:41:03,510
Do I have to...

949
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:04,170
Oh, okay.

950
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:05,010
And then...

951
00:41:05,010 --> 00:41:05,810
And then I swap.

952
00:41:06,410 --> 00:41:06,770
Alright.

953
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:07,690
And I go...

954
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:08,690
God, you're so useless.

955
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:10,170
I hate you.

956
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:14,110
Oh, what?

957
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:17,270
Wait.

958
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:19,510
Why?

959
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:24,450
What do I...

960
00:41:24,450 --> 00:41:26,170
What is my purpose up here?

961
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:26,690
Okay.

962
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:27,610
What...

963
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:29,390
What was my purpose?

964
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:31,070
Don't...

965
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:33,890
Why did he have to be up here?

966
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:37,210
I don't know.

967
00:41:37,530 --> 00:41:38,530
I guess I'll just...

968
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:39,190
Fuck it.

969
00:41:40,770 --> 00:41:41,130
Alright.

970
00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:44,570
Alright.

971
00:41:45,310 --> 00:41:45,730
Alright.

972
00:41:45,730 --> 00:41:46,870
I keep forward.

973
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:48,310
Thank you for the super chat.

974
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:48,770
Thank you.

975
00:41:48,910 --> 00:41:49,310
Thank you.

976
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:52,110
I couldn't catch last Mario mon stream.

977
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:53,710
But I watched the VOD.

978
00:41:53,850 --> 00:41:56,610
I saw you moved me from exile box to the goon cave.

979
00:41:56,830 --> 00:42:00,770
A humble fart like me doesn't deserve such luxurious.

980
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:02,470
Well...

981
00:42:02,470 --> 00:42:04,510
You see, the reason why...

982
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:07,350
You know the reason why you got moved to the goon cave.

983
00:42:07,350 --> 00:42:09,350
Is so that Gordon...

984
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:11,070
Wanted to sit on you, right?

985
00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:12,670
Like...

986
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:17,110
You got...

987
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:18,130
Ch-ch-chosen.

988
00:42:20,430 --> 00:42:21,050
Yeah.

989
00:42:21,850 --> 00:42:24,210
How does that make you feel for...

990
00:42:24,210 --> 00:42:25,270
That this was...

991
00:42:25,270 --> 00:42:26,710
This became your purpose.

992
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:32,030
Wait, I can't even move this.

993
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:35,290
What the fuck?

994
00:42:37,350 --> 00:42:38,110
Oh my god.

995
00:42:38,290 --> 00:42:39,110
This is a puzzle.

996
00:42:39,970 --> 00:42:41,310
This is a puzzle.

997
00:42:41,830 --> 00:42:43,450
I guess I could just...

998
00:42:43,450 --> 00:42:43,910
Swim over.

999
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:44,910
Whee.

1000
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:46,270
Wait.

1001
00:42:48,170 --> 00:42:49,350
What can you do?

1002
00:42:50,970 --> 00:42:51,730
What?

1003
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:57,360
What?

1004
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:59,460
What do you do?

1005
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:01,680
What is your purpose in life?

1006
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:04,940
Okay.

1007
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:05,020
Okay.

1008
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:08,580
I'm...

1009
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:09,280
I'm thinking.

1010
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:11,600
I am thinking right now.

1011
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:14,500
What?

1012
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:17,120
Oh shit.

1013
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:18,140
That's not what I want to do.

1014
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:21,860
Alright.

1015
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,120
I'll figure this out.

1016
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:25,360
Don't make me...

1017
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,120
Don't make me use that to sit on you.

1018
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:30,760
Alright.

1019
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:31,300
Let's see.

1020
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:35,660
Can I smash those bricks?

1021
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:37,180
Wait.

1022
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:37,740
Can I?

1023
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:41,620
Oh!

1024
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:46,660
I didn't realize they were smashable.

1025
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:49,380
I'm just being a little silly.

1026
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:50,300
A toad?

1027
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,300
Are you kidding me?

1028
00:43:52,050 --> 00:43:52,920
I mean...

1029
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:53,380
Can you?

1030
00:43:55,130 --> 00:43:55,540
Okay.

1031
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:56,680
But like...

1032
00:43:56,950 --> 00:43:59,000
Do I want to smash it?

1033
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:01,220
Alright.

1034
00:44:02,130 --> 00:44:02,540
Uh...

1035
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:04,840
I don't remember what they're weak against.

1036
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:06,160
It's been so long.

1037
00:44:08,010 --> 00:44:09,240
Maybe sunny...

1038
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:09,840
Snow?

1039
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:11,580
Was the...

1040
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:12,800
Womp weak against fire?

1041
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:14,100
Or...

1042
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:14,460
Water?

1043
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:15,500
Or snow?

1044
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:17,660
Guys, I...

1045
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:19,160
I don't know.

1046
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:20,060
I don't remember.

1047
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:21,300
This is the worst part.

1048
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:23,880
Because I'm playing as toad and he's so fucking weak.

1049
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:25,420
I don't know.

1050
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:26,720
Oh, weaker to ice?

1051
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:27,100
Okay.

1052
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:30,420
Okay.

1053
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:31,840
And then...

1054
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,020
I don't know.

1055
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:35,880
Carry him.

1056
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:40,340
As...

1057
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:42,420
Thank you for the super chat.

1058
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:42,840
Thank you.

1059
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:43,460
Thank you.

1060
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:45,940
Ask chat what something weird is called.

1061
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:47,020
One guy answers.

1062
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:49,660
Blames that guy for everything.

1063
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:51,340
Typical dokey.

1064
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:54,000
Okay, Mr. Gordon Freeman.

1065
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:56,600
Don't pretend you're all innocent here.

1066
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,320
I asked...

1067
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,840
What is that cake fetish called?

1068
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:05,060
Where a guy or a woman sits on a cake.

1069
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:05,200
Like...

1070
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:06,760
And you were one of the...

1071
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:07,340
You're like...

1072
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:09,240
Oh, I know what this is!

1073
00:45:09,710 --> 00:45:11,060
It's called...

1074
00:45:14,810 --> 00:45:19,800
You chose to answer that specific question.

1075
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:26,020
Maybe...

1076
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:29,800
Maybe you should tell me why you know that.

1077
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:40,660
So is being informed about the internet a sin?

1078
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:43,620
It's not just that.

1079
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:46,140
It's what you're informed about.

1080
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:53,040
You set yourself up.

1081
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:57,380
You could have picked any other question to answer.

1082
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:03,460
Simple minded.

1083
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:05,120
Thank you for the super chat.

1084
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:06,180
Thank you, thank you.

1085
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:08,860
Can you please name the next one you catch after me?

1086
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:09,960
My standards are low.

1087
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:12,660
So I don't care what it is.

1088
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:14,640
Thank you for the super chat.

1089
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:15,940
Thank you, thank you.

1090
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:19,260
Oh, so now knowledge is a sin?

1091
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:20,400
No, no, no.

1092
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:22,970
It just depends on what the knowledge is.

1093
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:29,460
Aura, thank you for the super chat.

1094
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:30,300
Thank you, thank you.

1095
00:46:30,460 --> 00:46:32,600
Yeah, I smashed Hulk 1973.

1096
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:36,640
Okay, that should kill him.

1097
00:46:38,540 --> 00:46:39,180
Yay!

1098
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:49,640
Can someone named Jokey Bird spits on Marvel Rivals recommended me?

1099
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:53,060
I told you guys, right?

1100
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:54,700
Whenever like...

1101
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:57,440
Cause like, streamer mode doesn't work on Overwatch anymore.

1102
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:58,600
Unless you play...

1103
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:00,120
Unless you win like...

1104
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:00,860
I don't remember how many.

1105
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,760
100 plus games or some shit.

1106
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:04,000
Or was it 500?

1107
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,480
I don't fucking remember.

1108
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:07,840
It was like an obscene amount of games.

1109
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:09,880
And then whenever they like...

1110
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:11,760
Like, because it doesn't work anymore.

1111
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:12,980
And then they'll be like...

1112
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:13,640
Are you Jokey...

1113
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:14,820
So it just says Jokey Bird?

1114
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:15,740
And then they're like...

1115
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:16,620
Are you Jokey Bird?

1116
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:18,360
And of course I lie and say no.

1117
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:19,140
Alright.

1118
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:24,280
I'll just be like...

1119
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:25,620
I'm just a fan of her.

1120
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:26,580
Like...

1121
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:33,020
And then they'll just be like...

1122
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:33,640
Aw man.

1123
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:35,000
I'm so stupid.

1124
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,080
Asking this random person if they're a Jokey Bird fan.

1125
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:38,820
Aw man.

1126
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:39,820
What do they know?

1127
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:41,520
That was me.

1128
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:43,600
So if anyone ever asks you...

1129
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:44,580
Are you Jokey Bird?

1130
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:45,720
Just say...

1131
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:46,060
No.

1132
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:48,760
Because obviously, lying is a sin.

1133
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:49,860
Unless you're me.

1134
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,820
And I know I'm already going to hell.

1135
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:53,800
So like...

1136
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:55,520
One more lie doesn't hurt me.

1137
00:47:58,820 --> 00:47:59,620
Um...

1138
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:01,460
What's...

1139
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:02,740
One more lie.

1140
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:05,060
What's gonna happen to me?

1141
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:06,420
Anyway...

1142
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:07,480
I'm going to go to...

1143
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:08,840
The worst type of hell?

1144
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:09,900
Um...

1145
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:11,340
So true...

1146
00:48:11,340 --> 00:48:12,540
Pear...

1147
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:13,460
Um...

1148
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:14,840
She's well prepared.

1149
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:17,680
Anyway...

1150
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:18,780
You are forgiven...

1151
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:19,260
Forgiven.

1152
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:23,440
Eating, thank you for going to super hell.

1153
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:27,480
It only takes one more lie for me to...

1154
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:28,240
No, Toki!

1155
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:31,480
You're one lie away from super hell, Toki!

1156
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:32,980
Don't do it!

1157
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:36,840
Anyway...

1158
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:38,520
Eating, thank you for the super chat.

1159
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:39,540
Thank you, thank you.

1160
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:42,720
Not the worst person to be recommended by.

1161
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:43,920
Not so Deadpool.

1162
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:45,240
Thank you for the super chat.

1163
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:46,300
Thank you, thank you.

1164
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:50,100
You should tell one person, yes, but no one will ever believe you.

1165
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:52,960
Oh, so I do that thing the Ghostbuster guy does.

1166
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:56,920
Where he, like, fucks with people and just tells them, like, does, like, ridiculous shit.

1167
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:59,780
And then he'll be like, no one will ever believe you.

1168
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:04,240
But the thing is, they can just screenshot that.

1169
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:13,040
You know what's the difference between interaction on the internet versus interactions in real life?

1170
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:15,820
You can't screenshot an IRL encounter.

1171
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:22,370
Ah, yes, the Bill Murray...

1172
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:24,640
The Bill Murray thing.

1173
00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:28,460
I can record you IRL.

1174
00:49:34,890 --> 00:49:36,780
That's just a photograph.

1175
00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:41,640
Um, Fudge, thank you for the super chat.

1176
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:43,300
Thank you, thank you, free my man.

1177
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:46,000
He doesn't deserve to be known as the Cake Fighter.

1178
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:50,420
Dragoons don't deserve to be degraded into their fetishes.

1179
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:54,240
So, anyway, is there inflation in this game?

1180
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:56,600
Thank you for the super chat.

1181
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:57,700
Thank you, thank you.

1182
00:49:58,200 --> 00:49:58,780
Ah, yes.

1183
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:01,400
You caught him.

1184
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:02,060
Oh, yes.

1185
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:02,860
Oh, you're talking...

1186
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:03,440
Oh, wait, what's this?

1187
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:04,360
Hammer arm.

1188
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:06,000
Also lower speed.

1189
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:07,240
Okay, who do we...

1190
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:08,160
What do we not need?

1191
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:09,400
You know what?

1192
00:50:09,580 --> 00:50:09,760
Okay.

1193
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:13,060
What weather do we not need, guys?

1194
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:19,620
What is the weather that we not need?

1195
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:21,800
For more information.

1196
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:25,920
Look up Sonic inflation.

1197
00:50:26,580 --> 00:50:26,900
For the...

1198
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:29,060
For Sonic's impact on...

1199
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:30,800
The economics of gaming.

1200
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:32,820
Rain?

1201
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:35,680
Okay, we'll get rain out.

1202
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:38,580
Jokey, no!

1203
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:45,120
Uh...

1204
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:46,420
Gordon, thank you for the super chat.

1205
00:50:46,580 --> 00:50:47,400
Thank you, thank you.

1206
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:51,560
It's from an episode of Super Mario Sunshine Let's Play where...

1207
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:52,160
Who's they?

1208
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:57,400
When they found the girl from the video on Craigslist.

1209
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:58,540
Who's they?

1210
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:04,460
Who is they?

1211
00:51:08,420 --> 00:51:09,920
Oh, Ice Hammer.

1212
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:10,900
Wait, that's great.

1213
00:51:12,540 --> 00:51:14,680
Wait, I don't have to use...

1214
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:16,120
Snowscape anymore.

1215
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:17,160
I have Ice Hammer.

1216
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:20,080
Yeah.

1217
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:21,560
Alright.

1218
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:23,260
Himself.

1219
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:24,320
Haha.

1220
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:25,840
That's what they all say.

1221
00:51:27,340 --> 00:51:27,980
Yay!

1222
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:31,160
Oh my god!

1223
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:33,500
How many moves do you know?

1224
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:39,180
Now you have crab- You know what?

1225
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:39,700
Fuck it.

1226
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:40,620
Let's get rid of...

1227
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:41,820
No...

1228
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,680
Let's get rid of Ice Toss.

1229
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:46,620
We'll just use Sunny Day for...

1230
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:48,800
For...

1231
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:49,440
For...

1232
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:50,360
I'll just grab...

1233
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:51,260
It is a hap...

1234
00:51:51,260 --> 00:51:52,260
It is a hap...

1235
00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:53,760
Yeah, I'm gonna get rid of Ice Toss.

1236
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:57,720
Everything returns to crab.

1237
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:01,600
Alright.

1238
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:02,920
Nice.

1239
00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:03,960
All the hammers.

1240
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:05,660
I'm keeping the Sunny Day for Dad.

1241
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:07,400
He deserves it.

1242
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:09,800
Bleh!

1243
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:10,940
That's it?

1244
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:14,440
Okay, I need to actually heal him though.

1245
00:52:20,350 --> 00:52:20,710
Alright.

1246
00:52:22,790 --> 00:52:23,510
Is it him?

1247
00:52:23,790 --> 00:52:24,810
Is it the green boy?

1248
00:52:25,190 --> 00:52:26,130
Oh, it's green boy.

1249
00:52:27,170 --> 00:52:27,890
Lord Kurosus!

1250
00:52:28,090 --> 00:52:28,810
Thank you in the super chat.

1251
00:52:28,910 --> 00:52:29,730
Thank you, thank you.

1252
00:52:29,970 --> 00:52:32,510
I can't believe Dragos are getting shamed for the fetishes.

1253
00:52:32,690 --> 00:52:33,530
Anyway, totally underrated.

1254
00:52:33,990 --> 00:52:40,470
But can I- I can't- But if I can't be renamed to a drag- Dragon or a dinosaur Mario Mon, At least put one in the goon-

1255
00:52:44,430 --> 00:52:45,810
Wait, who are you?

1256
00:52:46,010 --> 00:52:48,530
In the- In- In Mario Mon.

1257
00:52:48,910 --> 00:52:50,490
Who even are you?

1258
00:52:54,130 --> 00:52:54,610
Alright.

1259
00:52:54,870 --> 00:52:56,330
Oh, that's the captain's box.

1260
00:52:56,490 --> 00:52:57,190
Alright, give me a sec.

1261
00:52:57,270 --> 00:52:58,050
Let me rotate.

1262
00:52:58,770 --> 00:53:02,530
I need to see you- Alright.

1263
00:53:02,890 --> 00:53:04,590
I need to know which one are you.

1264
00:53:06,910 --> 00:53:07,550
Alright.

1265
00:53:07,890 --> 00:53:08,230
Let's see.

1266
00:53:08,290 --> 00:53:09,250
Are you the Goomba?

1267
00:53:09,370 --> 00:53:10,450
Are you the first one?

1268
00:53:10,870 --> 00:53:11,350
Oh.

1269
00:53:12,270 --> 00:53:13,170
There you are.

1270
00:53:13,210 --> 00:53:13,750
I see you.

1271
00:53:13,810 --> 00:53:15,150
You already got one!

1272
00:53:15,570 --> 00:53:16,770
You got Ipu!

1273
00:53:17,590 --> 00:53:19,730
Is his- Is his lips not enough?

1274
00:53:20,490 --> 00:53:21,130
Kurosus.

1275
00:53:21,530 --> 00:53:24,150
Are his lips not enough for you?

1276
00:53:27,810 --> 00:53:29,970
Ipu, how do you feel about this?

1277
00:53:29,970 --> 00:53:31,150
You worked so hard.

1278
00:53:31,450 --> 00:53:33,430
You worked so hard.

1279
00:53:35,410 --> 00:53:36,470
For him.

1280
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:39,910
And then he- He is requesting another one.

1281
00:53:40,270 --> 00:53:42,590
He is requesting a different Dragoon.

1282
00:53:46,330 --> 00:53:47,070
Damn.

1283
00:53:50,670 --> 00:53:51,780
So greedy.

1284
00:53:52,630 --> 00:53:55,230
He has the biggest lips too.

1285
00:53:56,810 --> 00:53:57,920
Where's Cygoon?

1286
00:53:58,210 --> 00:53:59,130
Is Cygoon here?

1287
00:53:59,350 --> 00:54:01,640
Are you satisfied with your Dragoon?

1288
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:12,720
Oh, just cause he's not a dragon or a dinosaur.

1289
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:16,500
It's just not- It's just not enough.

1290
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:17,440
I'm sorry.

1291
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:22,020
Seems like- Seems like the customer wasn't satisfied, Ipu.

1292
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:23,460
I'm sorry.

1293
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:24,580
Don't worry.

1294
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:29,740
You can- Don't worry.

1295
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:30,840
I'm sorry, Oni.

1296
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:33,400
I got to- You- You're being moved.

1297
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:35,840
From the private X room.

1298
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:43,220
You get to take a little break, Ipu.

1299
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:45,040
There you go.

1300
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:46,940
We need you.

1301
00:54:47,180 --> 00:54:48,820
You got- Called up.

1302
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:53,160
Butchop.

1303
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:54,220
Thank you for the super chat.

1304
00:54:54,340 --> 00:54:54,600
Thank you.

1305
00:54:54,740 --> 00:54:55,240
Thank you.

1306
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:55,960
I volunteer.

1307
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:59,060
My lips may not be the biggest, but they'll be the juiciest.

1308
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:00,280
Thank you for the super chat.

1309
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:00,640
Thank you.

1310
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:01,260
Thank you.

1311
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:01,900
John.

1312
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:02,840
Thank you for the super chat.

1313
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:03,080
Thank you.

1314
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:03,440
Thank you.

1315
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:03,980
I volunteer.

1316
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:06,900
Just get me out of daycare, please.

1317
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:11,040
In front of Mehdi like that?

1318
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:11,080
What?

1319
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:15,700
No, you guys have to keep making more eggs for me.

1320
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:17,760
Manny, thank you for the super chat.

1321
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:18,100
Thank you.

1322
00:55:18,220 --> 00:55:18,600
Thank you.

1323
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:19,820
It was used up.

1324
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:21,500
He belongs to the streets.

1325
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:23,760
People, thank you for the super chat.

1326
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:24,320
Thank you.

1327
00:55:24,540 --> 00:55:25,160
Thank you.

1328
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:28,420
There we go.

1329
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:30,380
Alright.

1330
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:31,980
Oh, I have to swap.

1331
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:33,660
Alright.

1332
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:36,020
No!

1333
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:38,200
It's time to make more kids.

1334
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:43,160
Alright.

1335
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:44,480
Gordon, thank you for the super chat.

1336
00:55:44,620 --> 00:55:44,860
Thank you.

1337
00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:45,340
Thank you.

1338
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:47,760
It was Green Grumps, Miss VTuber, Aaron.

1339
00:55:48,260 --> 00:55:48,920
That's it.

1340
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:51,880
Oh, that resets it for me.

1341
00:55:51,980 --> 00:55:52,160
Okay.

1342
00:55:53,620 --> 00:55:54,020
Alright.

1343
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:54,620
Let's see.

1344
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:56,160
And then we gotta go this way.

1345
00:55:58,020 --> 00:55:58,420
Okay.

1346
00:55:58,560 --> 00:55:59,640
And then...

1347
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:01,960
Then I should be able to get across now.

1348
00:56:02,820 --> 00:56:03,180
Yay!

1349
00:56:08,610 --> 00:56:09,010
Alright.

1350
00:56:09,210 --> 00:56:10,670
Get that Skeeter out of here.

1351
00:56:10,670 --> 00:56:10,750
Yeah.

1352
00:56:12,790 --> 00:56:14,150
Jen, thank you for the super chat.

1353
00:56:14,290 --> 00:56:14,450
Thank you.

1354
00:56:14,550 --> 00:56:14,890
Thank you.

1355
00:56:15,010 --> 00:56:18,830
The next one you catch, I've volunteered to be named and thrown into the Goon Cave.

1356
00:56:19,190 --> 00:56:19,530
See?

1357
00:56:19,910 --> 00:56:21,030
See, Kurosis?

1358
00:56:21,670 --> 00:56:23,470
Why can't you be just like Jen?

1359
00:56:25,350 --> 00:56:28,030
They're willing to just be thrown into the cave?

1360
00:56:30,030 --> 00:56:31,470
They have no demands.

1361
00:56:31,470 --> 00:56:33,770
They just wanna enjoy themselves.

1362
00:56:33,770 --> 00:56:34,050
They just wanna enjoy themselves.

1363
00:56:40,150 --> 00:56:40,490
Alright.

1364
00:56:41,390 --> 00:56:43,490
They know what their job is!

1365
00:56:48,990 --> 00:56:49,670
Alright.

1366
00:56:50,170 --> 00:56:50,850
Let's...

1367
00:56:50,850 --> 00:56:52,450
Let's beat up this monkey.

1368
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:58,900
Alright, let's see.

1369
00:56:59,240 --> 00:56:59,880
You crush.

1370
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:01,140
Sit on him.

1371
00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:02,340
Come on, watch.

1372
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:07,040
Nice.

1373
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:08,100
Thank God that's not...

1374
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:09,440
Super effective.

1375
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:11,600
Goodbye, monkey.

1376
00:57:14,740 --> 00:57:15,660
Yay!

1377
00:57:21,790 --> 00:57:22,650
Rock Blast.

1378
00:57:22,750 --> 00:57:23,790
It's not gonna do anything.

1379
00:57:24,650 --> 00:57:25,830
That's right.

1380
00:57:26,890 --> 00:57:29,130
I know some type advantages.

1381
00:57:30,410 --> 00:57:31,570
Only son.

1382
00:57:34,570 --> 00:57:35,330
Pop!

1383
00:57:36,890 --> 00:57:37,270
No.

1384
00:57:37,630 --> 00:57:39,830
You don't get anything in the exile.

1385
00:57:45,990 --> 00:57:48,110
You don't make any demands.

1386
00:57:48,110 --> 00:57:51,870
If you're in the exile box, you don't make any demands.

1387
00:57:55,410 --> 00:57:57,010
Baby, thank you for the super chat.

1388
00:57:57,150 --> 00:57:58,110
Thank you, thank you.

1389
00:58:01,110 --> 00:58:01,750
That's right.

1390
00:58:01,910 --> 00:58:04,090
There's no pleasure in the exile box.

1391
00:58:08,410 --> 00:58:09,870
I'm suddenly very glad.

1392
00:58:10,150 --> 00:58:12,690
I failed to get a mod named early on.

1393
00:58:12,970 --> 00:58:14,010
Thank you for the super chat.

1394
00:58:14,150 --> 00:58:15,210
Thank you, thank you.

1395
00:58:15,430 --> 00:58:16,070
Alright, let's get.

1396
00:58:17,050 --> 00:58:17,750
Over here.

1397
00:58:17,750 --> 00:58:19,290
Oh, thank you for the super chat.

1398
00:58:19,410 --> 00:58:19,570
Thank you.

1399
00:58:19,790 --> 00:58:20,270
Thank you.

1400
00:58:21,030 --> 00:58:22,830
Mom, I'm scared of the dragoons.

1401
00:58:22,970 --> 00:58:24,550
I want to go home.

1402
00:58:24,830 --> 00:58:26,150
That is your home.

1403
00:58:26,730 --> 00:58:33,370
You think you have... You think there is a place that exists beyond your box?

1404
00:58:33,630 --> 00:58:36,470
No, that is your home.

1405
00:58:39,370 --> 00:58:41,690
You live there forever now.

1406
00:58:45,650 --> 00:58:47,730
Alright, we're gonna kill Clubber.

1407
00:58:49,210 --> 00:58:50,370
No escape.

1408
00:58:51,690 --> 00:58:57,930
This is why... This is why... I think like... I think that's why more and more mons are resisting capture.

1409
00:58:58,250 --> 00:58:59,610
They know what goes on.

1410
00:59:02,590 --> 00:59:06,510
They all know now what goes on in that PC box.

1411
00:59:06,770 --> 00:59:08,690
They don't want to be part of it.

1412
00:59:09,070 --> 00:59:13,550
They don't... It used to be so easy to catch them.

1413
00:59:14,610 --> 00:59:16,810
When did it get so difficult?

1414
00:59:17,010 --> 00:59:18,590
They've heard the rumors.

1415
00:59:23,450 --> 00:59:25,250
Someone broke the NDA.

1416
00:59:28,350 --> 00:59:29,310
What's this?

1417
00:59:29,750 --> 00:59:30,050
Demony.

1418
00:59:30,410 --> 00:59:32,650
There's more damage if an ally fainted.

1419
00:59:32,730 --> 00:59:33,650
Nobody's gonna faint.

1420
00:59:35,650 --> 00:59:37,410
It's like they knew.

1421
00:59:40,290 --> 00:59:41,630
Wait, what video?

1422
00:59:41,990 --> 00:59:43,490
I took away all your phones.

1423
00:59:43,810 --> 00:59:45,450
You can't contact the outside world.

1424
00:59:45,770 --> 00:59:47,430
It's like Big Brother.

1425
00:59:49,510 --> 00:59:53,430
You don't know what's going on outside when you're in the box.

1426
00:59:53,630 --> 00:59:56,650
All you know is where you live.

1427
00:59:59,510 --> 01:00:00,610
Oh, so...

1428
01:00:00,610 --> 01:00:01,690
I have to send...

1429
01:00:01,690 --> 01:00:02,150
Oh, okay.

1430
01:00:02,270 --> 01:00:02,790
Wait, what?

1431
01:00:03,590 --> 01:00:04,530
I don't have...

1432
01:00:04,530 --> 01:00:06,050
Oh, I have to go on the other side.

1433
01:00:06,050 --> 01:00:06,130
Oh, man.

1434
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:10,300
Okay.

1435
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:12,400
So I have to send Toad down here.

1436
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:13,540
Maybe?

1437
01:00:15,740 --> 01:00:16,420
Alright.

1438
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:19,900
No, you just live there forever.

1439
01:00:24,820 --> 01:00:26,480
No one's leaving.

1440
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:30,700
Oh, nice.

1441
01:00:30,820 --> 01:00:31,220
My TM.

1442
01:00:35,780 --> 01:00:37,640
You can never escape.

1443
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:44,450
Okay.

1444
01:00:45,050 --> 01:00:45,770
Oh, fuck.

1445
01:00:46,450 --> 01:00:49,330
I guess like Toad has to come down here, right?

1446
01:00:50,470 --> 01:00:52,490
Because there's like nothing else to do here.

1447
01:00:59,490 --> 01:01:01,110
What the fuck do you do?

1448
01:01:06,020 --> 01:01:06,760
Doki, please.

1449
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:08,080
Oh, Nii, thank you for super chat.

1450
01:01:08,220 --> 01:01:08,400
Thank you.

1451
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:08,860
Thank you.

1452
01:01:08,980 --> 01:01:10,580
Doki, please let me out of the cave.

1453
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:12,220
I can't move at all.

1454
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:14,200
Well, you gotta thank Kurosis for that.

1455
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:15,860
He requested you.

1456
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:21,680
I remember.

1457
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:23,720
This is what Kurosis wanted.

1458
01:01:26,180 --> 01:01:27,840
I skipped the part I did.

1459
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:33,180
Solid, thank you for the super chat.

1460
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:33,660
Thank you.

1461
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:34,460
Thank you.

1462
01:01:36,580 --> 01:01:37,460
Just remember.

1463
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:40,140
Kurosis requested you.

1464
01:01:43,980 --> 01:01:45,500
Sorry, there's nothing I could do.

1465
01:01:46,340 --> 01:01:50,320
Please, I don't want to keep getting stick bugged.

1466
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:52,280
Get me out of here.

1467
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:57,520
Alright.

1468
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:06,240
Oh, it's here.

1469
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:07,900
Alright, I found it.

1470
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:10,240
And then...

1471
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:11,420
Toad has to come with me.

1472
01:02:14,020 --> 01:02:14,500
Okay.

1473
01:02:15,780 --> 01:02:16,860
Now push that.

1474
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:18,720
Wee!

1475
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:22,480
Wait.

1476
01:02:23,780 --> 01:02:25,900
Can I even get over on the other side?

1477
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:27,040
No.

1478
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:28,040
Wait a minute.

1479
01:02:28,300 --> 01:02:29,200
Why did I do that?

1480
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:35,220
I can't even get to the other side.

1481
01:02:39,620 --> 01:02:40,460
Oh, wait.

1482
01:02:40,580 --> 01:02:43,180
Will I be able to move it if I do the hands?

1483
01:02:45,020 --> 01:02:46,840
No, I can't.

1484
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:48,680
Oh!

1485
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:50,280
I'm being silly.

1486
01:02:52,940 --> 01:02:54,980
I'm so silly.

1487
01:02:56,360 --> 01:02:57,040
Okay.

1488
01:02:58,300 --> 01:02:59,340
Puzzle's hard.

1489
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:05,820
Guys, I can push the rock back.

1490
01:03:08,340 --> 01:03:09,300
Alright.

1491
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:10,320
Nice.

1492
01:03:11,020 --> 01:03:13,100
Just being a little silly right now.

1493
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:18,180
What does that go to?

1494
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:21,080
What did I do to that rock?

1495
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:23,000
Oh!

1496
01:03:25,160 --> 01:03:27,600
Okay, so that means I can go up this waterfall now, right?

1497
01:03:31,860 --> 01:03:32,300
No?

1498
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:34,340
What the fuck did I do to that rock?

1499
01:03:39,890 --> 01:03:41,970
Yeah, but where does it block to?

1500
01:03:44,290 --> 01:03:45,590
Oh, one more boulder?

1501
01:03:46,770 --> 01:03:48,110
Is it this boulder?

1502
01:03:49,170 --> 01:03:51,170
Wait, what other boulder can I move?

1503
01:03:51,630 --> 01:03:53,010
Oh, is it this one?

1504
01:03:54,130 --> 01:03:54,690
Oh!

1505
01:03:55,410 --> 01:03:56,170
There it is.

1506
01:04:00,790 --> 01:04:01,350
Oh!

1507
01:04:01,790 --> 01:04:02,630
I see.

1508
01:04:05,570 --> 01:04:08,310
I didn't even realize I had to move this boulder, too.

1509
01:04:11,110 --> 01:04:11,950
Alright, don't worry.

1510
01:04:12,010 --> 01:04:12,710
I got you.

1511
01:04:20,930 --> 01:04:21,610
Is that it?

1512
01:04:21,910 --> 01:04:22,790
Oh, there you go.

1513
01:04:23,110 --> 01:04:23,390
Nice.

1514
01:04:23,550 --> 01:04:23,710
Oops.

1515
01:04:26,710 --> 01:04:27,070
Oopsie.

1516
01:04:29,690 --> 01:04:30,050
Alright.

1517
01:04:31,870 --> 01:04:33,290
Baby, thank you for the super chat.

1518
01:04:33,410 --> 01:04:33,650
Thank you.

1519
01:04:33,770 --> 01:04:34,090
Thank you.

1520
01:04:34,210 --> 01:04:36,630
Actually, I don't want to be a toad while I'm there.

1521
01:04:38,990 --> 01:04:40,450
Because Mario has...

1522
01:04:40,450 --> 01:04:41,910
Doki has the stronger mons.

1523
01:04:47,710 --> 01:04:48,050
Alright.

1524
01:04:49,510 --> 01:04:51,410
Well, he's already in his original position.

1525
01:04:53,650 --> 01:04:55,410
The Wadi Rage is never on!

1526
01:04:55,750 --> 01:04:58,010
If only you could stop this raging torrent!

1527
01:04:58,750 --> 01:04:59,430
Alright.

1528
01:04:59,750 --> 01:05:00,310
Smash!

1529
01:05:00,930 --> 01:05:01,610
Smash!

1530
01:05:02,570 --> 01:05:03,210
Smash!

1531
01:05:03,210 --> 01:05:03,310
Okay.

1532
01:05:03,610 --> 01:05:06,450
All I have to do is...

1533
01:05:06,450 --> 01:05:06,890
Push...

1534
01:05:09,510 --> 01:05:10,390
Down...

1535
01:05:10,390 --> 01:05:11,210
Right...

1536
01:05:11,210 --> 01:05:11,610
Oh, okay.

1537
01:05:11,690 --> 01:05:12,170
That's easy.

1538
01:05:12,590 --> 01:05:13,930
I figured it out.

1539
01:05:16,190 --> 01:05:17,070
Alright.

1540
01:05:17,450 --> 01:05:17,910
Push!

1541
01:05:18,830 --> 01:05:19,710
Push!

1542
01:05:22,070 --> 01:05:23,990
Push like you're pregnant!

1543
01:05:24,450 --> 01:05:24,950
Push!

1544
01:05:28,370 --> 01:05:29,250
Yeah!

1545
01:05:31,910 --> 01:05:32,790
Okay.

1546
01:05:33,590 --> 01:05:33,650
Okay.

1547
01:05:36,550 --> 01:05:37,270
And then...

1548
01:05:37,270 --> 01:05:37,850
What?

1549
01:05:38,090 --> 01:05:39,050
That's a good motivation.

1550
01:05:43,890 --> 01:05:44,810
That's a saying!

1551
01:05:45,210 --> 01:05:45,670
That's a...

1552
01:05:45,670 --> 01:05:47,290
That's a Canadian saying.

1553
01:05:47,750 --> 01:05:49,730
Any Canadians out there that would like a vouch for me?

1554
01:05:49,930 --> 01:05:51,010
We say that a lot.

1555
01:05:55,610 --> 01:05:56,930
Benny, thank you for the super chat.

1556
01:05:57,030 --> 01:05:57,270
Thank you.

1557
01:05:57,410 --> 01:05:57,810
Thank you.

1558
01:05:57,910 --> 01:06:00,410
At least I can say I'm not being passed around like the other goons.

1559
01:06:00,910 --> 01:06:02,130
I just can't bring...

1560
01:06:02,870 --> 01:06:04,310
Thank you for the super chat.

1561
01:06:04,470 --> 01:06:04,710
Thank you.

1562
01:06:04,830 --> 01:06:05,470
Thank you.

1563
01:06:05,470 --> 01:06:07,190
And now we swim.

1564
01:06:08,270 --> 01:06:08,630
Yeah!

1565
01:06:08,930 --> 01:06:09,390
Wait, what?

1566
01:06:11,030 --> 01:06:11,770
Oh my god.

1567
01:06:12,010 --> 01:06:12,490
Stick bug.

1568
01:06:13,210 --> 01:06:14,730
God damn stick bug.

1569
01:06:16,610 --> 01:06:17,010
Baby!

1570
01:06:17,190 --> 01:06:18,190
Thank you for the super chat.

1571
01:06:18,310 --> 01:06:18,570
Thank you.

1572
01:06:18,750 --> 01:06:19,350
Thank you.

1573
01:06:20,310 --> 01:06:21,450
And what's over here?

1574
01:06:22,510 --> 01:06:22,910
Okay.

1575
01:06:23,150 --> 01:06:23,310
Wait.

1576
01:06:23,590 --> 01:06:24,870
There's something over here.

1577
01:06:25,190 --> 01:06:25,910
Oh, is that the button?

1578
01:06:26,010 --> 01:06:26,470
Can I push that?

1579
01:06:26,570 --> 01:06:27,730
And then he'll be able to go over there?

1580
01:06:28,690 --> 01:06:31,790
Is that Laura of Exod is where we kicked out of the goon cave?

1581
01:06:31,910 --> 01:06:32,850
Or were we destined...

1582
01:06:32,850 --> 01:06:36,490
You guys are destined to banishment until you get requested.

1583
01:06:40,670 --> 01:06:43,050
To live your life, exile.

1584
01:06:43,470 --> 01:06:44,030
Don't worry.

1585
01:06:44,170 --> 01:06:45,290
You all sign an NDA.

1586
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:49,050
And then let me...

1587
01:06:49,050 --> 01:06:49,430
Smash.

1588
01:06:50,550 --> 01:06:51,310
Smash.

1589
01:06:52,010 --> 01:06:52,770
Smash.

1590
01:06:54,350 --> 01:06:55,110
Smash.

1591
01:06:56,010 --> 01:06:56,030
Smash.

1592
01:06:56,030 --> 01:06:56,570
Pass.

1593
01:06:57,710 --> 01:06:58,470
Okay.

1594
01:07:01,150 --> 01:07:02,970
There's this girl.

1595
01:07:03,530 --> 01:07:04,250
There's something here.

1596
01:07:05,050 --> 01:07:06,850
Oh, it's a power herb.

1597
01:07:08,630 --> 01:07:09,390
Yes.

1598
01:07:10,150 --> 01:07:11,350
Everyone signs...

1599
01:07:11,350 --> 01:07:13,810
When you're in the cab, an NDA shows up.

1600
01:07:18,690 --> 01:07:20,710
The moment you get capped...

1601
01:07:20,710 --> 01:07:20,810
Okay.

1602
01:07:21,010 --> 01:07:25,530
So, like, the NDA shows up in, like, 0.1 seconds from being captured and the click.

1603
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:28,890
So, the moment it clicks, you sign the contract.

1604
01:07:30,130 --> 01:07:30,570
Yeah.

1605
01:07:30,570 --> 01:07:31,990
When you accept it, you get caught.

1606
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:34,490
Exactly.

1607
01:07:35,730 --> 01:07:37,050
What am I supposed to bring this?

1608
01:07:37,130 --> 01:07:38,310
Oh, it's all the way over here.

1609
01:07:39,070 --> 01:07:39,350
Okay.

1610
01:07:39,710 --> 01:07:40,070
Down.

1611
01:07:40,070 --> 01:07:40,370
Down.

1612
01:07:41,330 --> 01:07:41,930
Okay.

1613
01:07:42,090 --> 01:07:43,170
I know how to do this.

1614
01:07:45,230 --> 01:07:45,530
Boop.

1615
01:07:46,450 --> 01:07:47,050
Boop.

1616
01:07:47,310 --> 01:07:47,830
Boop.

1617
01:07:49,290 --> 01:07:49,890
Boop.

1618
01:07:50,090 --> 01:07:51,970
And then...

1619
01:07:51,970 --> 01:07:52,730
Boop.

1620
01:07:53,250 --> 01:07:53,530
Boop.

1621
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:58,860
And here.

1622
01:08:00,180 --> 01:08:02,880
I mean, it's better than the alternatives, right, Smug?

1623
01:08:04,580 --> 01:08:06,580
Think of the super chat that you think.

1624
01:08:06,660 --> 01:08:06,940
Yeah.

1625
01:08:12,700 --> 01:08:13,300
Okay.

1626
01:08:13,700 --> 01:08:14,600
Where does this go?

1627
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:16,800
What was that?

1628
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:20,100
I don't remember where that one was.

1629
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:21,720
Oh, my God.

1630
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:23,660
Is it just all stick bug?

1631
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:25,160
Is that how that is?

1632
01:08:26,980 --> 01:08:28,840
It's just stick bug.

1633
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:32,220
I can't escape.

1634
01:08:32,220 --> 01:08:34,600
I close my eyes and I see him.

1635
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,280
Stick bug.

1636
01:08:38,220 --> 01:08:38,980
Oh!

1637
01:08:38,980 --> 01:08:40,240
Oh, my God.

1638
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:42,980
Oh, my God.

1639
01:08:46,220 --> 01:08:46,900
Okay.

1640
01:08:47,100 --> 01:08:47,640
We...

1641
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:48,840
There's just a dinosaur.

1642
01:08:49,360 --> 01:08:50,960
Just a fucking dinosaur.

1643
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:53,380
In my Mario game.

1644
01:08:56,160 --> 01:08:57,520
It's like...

1645
01:08:57,520 --> 01:09:03,160
It's not like it's like a special like Mario character or anything.

1646
01:09:03,480 --> 01:09:05,240
It's literally just a dinosaur.

1647
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:08,720
Okay.

1648
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:12,460
Oh, my God.

1649
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:13,780
Does anyone have like...

1650
01:09:13,780 --> 01:09:13,940
Okay.

1651
01:09:14,860 --> 01:09:15,640
My nudist.

1652
01:09:15,900 --> 01:09:16,960
My nude man.

1653
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:20,440
Yeah.

1654
01:09:20,440 --> 01:09:21,700
I know he's from Odyssey.

1655
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:22,460
Because like...

1656
01:09:22,460 --> 01:09:23,580
Dude, I remember...

1657
01:09:23,580 --> 01:09:24,640
Oh, my God.

1658
01:09:24,700 --> 01:09:25,340
There you go.

1659
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:27,720
You took off your clothes already.

1660
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:28,640
Okay.

1661
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:31,920
You already...

1662
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:33,720
You already took off your clothes.

1663
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:35,220
Good for you.

1664
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:36,240
Good...

1665
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:37,020
Good for you.

1666
01:09:37,180 --> 01:09:37,980
Get in here.

1667
01:09:38,360 --> 01:09:39,340
Ha ha ha ha.

1668
01:09:43,180 --> 01:09:45,400
I want to be a T-Rex.

1669
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:46,720
Don't keep...

1670
01:09:47,260 --> 01:09:49,040
Mr. Broken Bond.

1671
01:09:49,280 --> 01:09:51,060
Thank you for the Aka Super.

1672
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:51,780
Thank you.

1673
01:09:51,980 --> 01:09:52,480
Thank you.

1674
01:09:52,840 --> 01:09:53,420
Johnny.

1675
01:09:53,640 --> 01:09:54,680
Thank you for the Super.

1676
01:09:54,680 --> 01:09:55,120
Goodbye.

1677
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:56,120
My nude man.

1678
01:09:56,760 --> 01:09:57,740
If I can't.

1679
01:09:59,480 --> 01:10:00,080
Alright.

1680
01:10:01,160 --> 01:10:02,900
We're just going to slowly send in.

1681
01:10:04,980 --> 01:10:07,440
Mom's in there while we try to catch him.

1682
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:09,600
Okay.

1683
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:12,120
I'm scared of killing him.

1684
01:10:15,590 --> 01:10:16,110
Oh.

1685
01:10:16,450 --> 01:10:17,050
Oh, thank God.

1686
01:10:17,290 --> 01:10:17,410
Okay.

1687
01:10:17,730 --> 01:10:18,790
Thank God.

1688
01:10:19,510 --> 01:10:19,750
Oh.

1689
01:10:20,710 --> 01:10:21,250
No.

1690
01:10:21,610 --> 01:10:22,730
I swear to God.

1691
01:10:22,930 --> 01:10:24,490
You got tired?

1692
01:10:26,630 --> 01:10:27,390
You...

1693
01:10:27,390 --> 01:10:29,250
He got tired.

1694
01:10:29,970 --> 01:10:30,550
I...

1695
01:10:30,550 --> 01:10:31,050
How?

1696
01:10:31,430 --> 01:10:33,250
How did you get tired?

1697
01:10:33,770 --> 01:10:34,210
I...

1698
01:10:34,210 --> 01:10:34,830
I...

1699
01:10:34,830 --> 01:10:35,170
I...

1700
01:10:38,210 --> 01:10:38,650
I...

1701
01:10:38,650 --> 01:10:38,990
Yes.

1702
01:10:39,150 --> 01:10:39,950
Thank you for the Super chat.

1703
01:10:40,090 --> 01:10:40,310
Thank you.

1704
01:10:40,450 --> 01:10:40,870
Thank you.

1705
01:10:40,990 --> 01:10:41,230
Thank you.

1706
01:10:41,330 --> 01:10:43,230
This Yoshi looks a little weird.

1707
01:10:44,210 --> 01:10:44,650
Yeah.

1708
01:10:44,750 --> 01:10:45,550
I know he's from honesty.

1709
01:10:45,570 --> 01:10:47,030
Because I remember in the trailer, like...

1710
01:10:47,030 --> 01:10:48,030
Mario, like...

1711
01:10:48,030 --> 01:10:49,170
Twix over his body.

1712
01:10:49,450 --> 01:10:50,690
And he has his mustache.

1713
01:10:50,690 --> 01:10:51,030
Oh my gosh.

1714
01:10:54,210 --> 01:10:55,770
Thank you for the Super chat.

1715
01:10:55,930 --> 01:10:56,260
Thank you.

1716
01:10:56,930 --> 01:10:57,570
Thank you.

1717
01:10:57,570 --> 01:10:59,070
Thank you for the Magenta super.

1718
01:10:59,370 --> 01:10:59,550
Thank you.

1719
01:10:59,670 --> 01:11:00,050
Thank you.

1720
01:11:00,230 --> 01:11:03,890
I volunteered to nightly trample the goons in the cave.

1721
01:11:05,110 --> 01:11:06,170
All right.

1722
01:11:06,170 --> 01:11:06,830
Nice.

1723
01:11:08,590 --> 01:11:09,270
Here.

1724
01:11:09,390 --> 01:11:10,250
How is this here?

1725
01:11:10,330 --> 01:11:10,850
Exactly!

1726
01:11:11,210 --> 01:11:12,930
That's what I'm saying!

1727
01:11:13,510 --> 01:11:14,810
How is he here?

1728
01:11:15,290 --> 01:11:16,530
How is this here?

1729
01:11:16,730 --> 01:11:20,690
Why is his head so fucking big compared to his body?

1730
01:11:21,870 --> 01:11:22,750
Oh my god.

1731
01:11:22,950 --> 01:11:25,010
He looks like those dogs with no necks.

1732
01:11:25,390 --> 01:11:26,010
You know some...

1733
01:11:26,010 --> 01:11:27,530
There's like a genetic defect.

1734
01:11:27,670 --> 01:11:30,090
Where some dogs are born without necks.

1735
01:11:30,270 --> 01:11:31,950
That's what he looks like right now.

1736
01:11:32,110 --> 01:11:33,870
Like, he looks like a necklace dinosaur.

1737
01:11:34,330 --> 01:11:34,670
What?

1738
01:11:35,570 --> 01:11:36,790
Have you seen that?

1739
01:11:36,950 --> 01:11:39,170
I thought those were photoshopped.

1740
01:11:39,170 --> 01:11:41,910
But there's like actual dogs born without necks.

1741
01:11:42,270 --> 01:11:43,210
It's so weird.

1742
01:11:46,210 --> 01:11:46,710
Steampunk.

1743
01:11:46,850 --> 01:11:47,750
Thank you for the super chat.

1744
01:11:47,950 --> 01:11:48,250
Thank you.

1745
01:11:48,390 --> 01:11:48,850
Thank you.

1746
01:11:49,030 --> 01:11:50,870
I paid less money.

1747
01:11:51,170 --> 01:11:52,690
But it would be funny.

1748
01:11:54,750 --> 01:11:56,610
Does he got to have something to do about it?

1749
01:11:56,690 --> 01:11:57,750
Regardless, it's terrifying.

1750
01:11:57,950 --> 01:11:58,710
I want six...

1751
01:11:58,710 --> 01:11:59,410
I want a...

1752
01:11:59,410 --> 01:12:01,710
I want this necklace dinosaur in my...

1753
01:12:01,710 --> 01:12:02,610
What the fuck?

1754
01:12:02,750 --> 01:12:05,970
His miniature sprite looks so badass.

1755
01:12:07,410 --> 01:12:08,530
T-Rex easier.

1756
01:12:08,530 --> 01:12:09,410
It is ugly.

1757
01:12:09,750 --> 01:12:12,690
He's easier to catch than the fucking jabby.

1758
01:12:15,150 --> 01:12:16,770
Alright, broken bod.

1759
01:12:17,410 --> 01:12:18,990
Broken goon.

1760
01:12:26,110 --> 01:12:26,790
Broken...

1761
01:12:28,670 --> 01:12:29,350
Goon.

1762
01:12:30,550 --> 01:12:31,230
Alright.

1763
01:12:32,050 --> 01:12:32,770
I need...

1764
01:12:32,770 --> 01:12:32,910
Oh, wait.

1765
01:12:33,010 --> 01:12:33,670
No, you're not...

1766
01:12:33,670 --> 01:12:34,030
Don't...

1767
01:12:34,030 --> 01:12:34,550
Don't get...

1768
01:12:34,550 --> 01:12:35,030
Don't...

1769
01:12:35,030 --> 01:12:36,070
Get him out of the...

1770
01:12:36,070 --> 01:12:37,390
Get him out of the goon cave.

1771
01:12:37,390 --> 01:12:39,650
Don't let Kurosu see him.

1772
01:12:40,070 --> 01:12:40,510
Don't...

1773
01:12:42,750 --> 01:12:44,010
Don't let...

1774
01:12:44,010 --> 01:12:46,130
Don't let Kurosu see him.

1775
01:12:46,770 --> 01:12:49,350
Wait, is Yoshi also a dragon type?

1776
01:12:54,070 --> 01:12:55,570
Oh, he's normal.

1777
01:12:56,310 --> 01:12:56,910
But...

1778
01:12:59,790 --> 01:13:00,930
I'm sorry.

1779
01:13:01,510 --> 01:13:02,410
Wait, you're not...

1780
01:13:02,410 --> 01:13:03,070
Wait, you're...

1781
01:13:03,070 --> 01:13:04,850
You're just gonna be naked forever?

1782
01:13:07,970 --> 01:13:09,310
I can't...

1783
01:13:10,470 --> 01:13:12,550
Come back when you put clothes on.

1784
01:13:19,690 --> 01:13:22,970
Come back when you put some clothes on, Kaz.

1785
01:13:23,690 --> 01:13:24,350
Come...

1786
01:13:24,350 --> 01:13:24,690
Come...

1787
01:13:24,690 --> 01:13:25,270
Please...

1788
01:13:26,530 --> 01:13:27,870
What a freak.

1789
01:13:28,590 --> 01:13:29,190
That's right.

1790
01:13:29,590 --> 01:13:32,850
Get out of the party until you wear some fucking clothes.

1791
01:13:37,590 --> 01:13:42,110
You don't stand a chance against my master strategy, Mario.

1792
01:13:44,070 --> 01:13:45,650
There's children here.

1793
01:13:46,450 --> 01:13:47,330
No, no, no.

1794
01:13:47,610 --> 01:13:51,270
If you're a kid watching my stream, you're not allowed to technically.

1795
01:13:51,810 --> 01:13:53,050
You're under 13.

1796
01:13:54,190 --> 01:13:54,510
Yes.

1797
01:13:54,630 --> 01:13:55,490
Thank you for the super chat.

1798
01:13:55,630 --> 01:13:55,830
Thank you.

1799
01:13:55,950 --> 01:13:56,430
Thank you.

1800
01:13:56,690 --> 01:13:57,870
It's a fashion statement.

1801
01:13:57,870 --> 01:13:59,070
You wouldn't get it.

1802
01:13:59,070 --> 01:14:01,590
I have become fully bald.

1803
01:14:02,770 --> 01:14:04,950
That's why you're back in the cave.

1804
01:14:06,090 --> 01:14:08,130
Actually, you should be in the goon cave.

1805
01:14:11,250 --> 01:14:13,090
I forgot if there's like rocks.

1806
01:14:13,330 --> 01:14:15,110
You know, I'm just gonna throw a magnet at him.

1807
01:14:15,890 --> 01:14:16,710
Of course.

1808
01:14:16,870 --> 01:14:18,210
Of course, Yugi's protect.

1809
01:14:18,790 --> 01:14:20,690
He just don't wanna get sad on.

1810
01:14:25,960 --> 01:14:27,100
You just reflect?

1811
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:27,820
Oh, okay.

1812
01:14:27,900 --> 01:14:28,640
Just a little bit.

1813
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:31,460
Yeah, I'll sit on him again.

1814
01:14:35,490 --> 01:14:36,090
All right.

1815
01:14:36,190 --> 01:14:37,070
Goodbye, bird.

1816
01:14:39,070 --> 01:14:39,510
Bye.

1817
01:14:43,850 --> 01:14:44,290
Yay.

1818
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:52,860
Oh, he has like a custom music when he dies.

1819
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:53,680
That's cute.

1820
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:56,700
Lord Kurosis, thank you for the super chat.

1821
01:14:56,880 --> 01:14:57,180
Thank you.

1822
01:14:57,340 --> 01:14:57,820
Thank you.

1823
01:14:58,040 --> 01:14:58,720
Is that nice?

1824
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:00,740
He plays a...

1825
01:15:00,740 --> 01:15:02,800
He plays music for his death.

1826
01:15:03,100 --> 01:15:03,780
Oh, egg bomb.

1827
01:15:03,940 --> 01:15:04,480
Wait, that's good.

1828
01:15:07,020 --> 01:15:08,480
Throw your children, Yoshi.

1829
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:09,080
Yoshi.

1830
01:15:09,620 --> 01:15:10,360
All right.

1831
01:15:10,660 --> 01:15:12,060
We'll get rid of headbutt.

1832
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:14,240
It's time to throw your kids.

1833
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:18,940
You stay away.

1834
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:25,620
Don't let him near any of the dragons.

1835
01:15:30,860 --> 01:15:33,580
Okay, I'm gonna use the magnet bomb on him, too.

1836
01:15:35,860 --> 01:15:36,580
All right.

1837
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:39,080
Bye.

1838
01:15:39,300 --> 01:15:40,240
Oh, it's super effective.

1839
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:41,320
So happy.

1840
01:15:42,380 --> 01:15:43,340
Look at him.

1841
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:45,720
Oh my god, he lives that?

1842
01:15:46,260 --> 01:15:48,880
Oh my god, how big is that moon?

1843
01:15:50,220 --> 01:15:52,000
Oh, it hits both of me?

1844
01:15:52,200 --> 01:15:52,840
What does he do?

1845
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:54,400
Oh no, it doesn't.

1846
01:15:54,520 --> 01:15:55,420
It's just that it does himself.

1847
01:15:56,180 --> 01:15:57,200
Oh my god.

1848
01:15:57,920 --> 01:15:59,500
He's bigger than dad?

1849
01:15:59,940 --> 01:16:01,260
I can't believe it.

1850
01:16:01,320 --> 01:16:03,880
The moon is bigger than my dog.

1851
01:16:06,580 --> 01:16:07,180
Yay.

1852
01:16:08,460 --> 01:16:09,060
Bye.

1853
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:10,320
How?

1854
01:16:12,140 --> 01:16:14,280
Wait, I want to do something real quick.

1855
01:16:15,680 --> 01:16:16,620
Where is he?

1856
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:19,700
Since you're naked, you deserve to be in here.

1857
01:16:20,180 --> 01:16:20,560
All right.

1858
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:22,880
No more dragon time for you.

1859
01:16:23,680 --> 01:16:24,220
You can...

1860
01:16:24,220 --> 01:16:26,080
Back to you, you're at the safety.

1861
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:30,020
Oh, no, you're not.

1862
01:16:31,980 --> 01:16:33,520
Eagerly waiting for this.

1863
01:16:33,680 --> 01:16:34,000
All right.

1864
01:16:34,540 --> 01:16:36,060
One lucky guy.

1865
01:16:36,720 --> 01:16:37,820
You know what?

1866
01:16:38,340 --> 01:16:38,740
Hmm.

1867
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:42,140
Hmm.

1868
01:16:44,460 --> 01:16:47,500
No, I don't think anyone deserves it yet.

1869
01:16:47,980 --> 01:16:48,400
I...

1870
01:16:52,760 --> 01:16:55,080
One lucky dragoon.

1871
01:16:56,420 --> 01:16:57,360
Oh, wait.

1872
01:16:57,440 --> 01:16:58,220
But what's over there?

1873
01:16:59,680 --> 01:17:01,240
There's something over here, though.

1874
01:17:03,100 --> 01:17:04,000
Wait, what?

1875
01:17:07,240 --> 01:17:09,860
I could have went this way this entire time?

1876
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:13,500
Oh my god.

1877
01:17:13,940 --> 01:17:14,620
Oh my god.

1878
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:16,620
Toad could have been there this entire time.

1879
01:17:18,260 --> 01:17:19,440
Okay, I got healed.

1880
01:17:19,640 --> 01:17:21,160
I got healed of Doki real quick.

1881
01:17:24,280 --> 01:17:24,880
Okay.

1882
01:17:28,410 --> 01:17:30,950
I can't believe there was a random dinosaur.

1883
01:17:31,610 --> 01:17:34,930
Like in Mario Lord, the dinosaurs never went extinct.

1884
01:17:35,110 --> 01:17:36,330
The meteor never happened.

1885
01:17:36,630 --> 01:17:37,590
That's crazy.

1886
01:17:40,810 --> 01:17:42,830
That's actually a crazy thing to think about.

1887
01:17:44,910 --> 01:17:46,730
The meteor never happened.

1888
01:17:46,730 --> 01:17:47,990
What else didn't happen?

1889
01:17:54,140 --> 01:17:55,380
There's no way.

1890
01:17:55,740 --> 01:17:58,380
If the meteor happened, explain the T-Rex.

1891
01:18:01,220 --> 01:18:02,000
All right.

1892
01:18:02,160 --> 01:18:02,660
Let's go together.

1893
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:05,920
We're at Banana Temple.

1894
01:18:06,860 --> 01:18:07,440
Hawaii!

1895
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:12,180
Excellent work.

1896
01:18:12,380 --> 01:18:13,800
As always, your explosiveness.

1897
01:18:15,680 --> 01:18:20,040
Now nothing stands between us and the golden banana.

1898
01:18:20,940 --> 01:18:21,540
Come on.

1899
01:18:21,740 --> 01:18:23,020
We're going in.

1900
01:18:23,340 --> 01:18:25,020
Wait, the monkeys just let him in?

1901
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:25,860
Sorry.

1902
01:18:25,980 --> 01:18:27,720
The gorillas just let him in?

1903
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:29,660
Looks like this is it, Mario!

1904
01:18:30,120 --> 01:18:32,120
We better make sure we're prepared for it.

1905
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:33,300
Before we take on Bowser.

1906
01:18:34,540 --> 01:18:36,380
I'm pretty sure we're prepared, right?

1907
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:37,160
Yay!

1908
01:18:37,420 --> 01:18:38,260
I got an air balloon!

1909
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:40,500
Not so Deadpool!

1910
01:18:40,660 --> 01:18:41,780
Thank you for the magenta soup!

1911
01:18:42,220 --> 01:18:42,640
Thank you!

1912
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:43,420
Thank you!

1913
01:18:44,160 --> 01:18:45,680
How's not so good in this?

1914
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:46,480
Ha ha!

1915
01:18:47,260 --> 01:18:48,060
DSL beauty!

1916
01:18:48,860 --> 01:18:49,680
Ha ha ha ha!

1917
01:18:51,660 --> 01:18:53,220
Wait, they're just going to let me in like that?

1918
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:54,480
Please!

1919
01:18:55,100 --> 01:18:55,500
Please!

1920
01:18:55,500 --> 01:18:57,820
No, not the golden banana.

1921
01:18:59,890 --> 01:19:01,500
What do you mean you lost it?

1922
01:19:04,270 --> 01:19:06,420
I mean I lost it.

1923
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:08,460
L-O-S-T.

1924
01:19:09,260 --> 01:19:12,600
Can't give you what I don't have.

1925
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:14,340
No!

1926
01:19:15,300 --> 01:19:15,820
No!

1927
01:19:16,620 --> 01:19:17,440
No!

1928
01:19:19,460 --> 01:19:21,920
How do you lose an all powerful artifact?

1929
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:25,480
It's your job to protect and watch over the golden.

1930
01:19:25,500 --> 01:19:25,980
The banana.

1931
01:19:26,620 --> 01:19:27,280
That's right.

1932
01:19:27,460 --> 01:19:28,120
That's what he get.

1933
01:19:28,200 --> 01:19:28,880
That's what they get.

1934
01:19:29,220 --> 01:19:32,400
Having a non-gorilla look after the banana.

1935
01:19:33,080 --> 01:19:38,600
I guess like the gorillas would have eaten the banana though.

1936
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:39,880
I mean that is smart.

1937
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:40,440
Never mind.

1938
01:19:41,460 --> 01:19:44,380
It is smart to not have a gorilla look after it.

1939
01:19:45,620 --> 01:19:47,880
So I decided to use it to clean my toilet.

1940
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:49,600
I haven't seen it.

1941
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:50,260
Never mind.

1942
01:19:50,440 --> 01:19:51,220
That wasn't smart.

1943
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:52,700
Ha ha ha ha!

1944
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:54,800
Comic.

1945
01:19:55,500 --> 01:19:56,660
Of course you're ruthless.

1946
01:19:58,820 --> 01:19:59,540
What?

1947
01:19:59,700 --> 01:20:00,800
Put me down.

1948
01:20:01,100 --> 01:20:02,660
What are you doing to me?

1949
01:20:03,140 --> 01:20:03,540
Ah!

1950
01:20:04,480 --> 01:20:05,340
Oh my god.

1951
01:20:05,420 --> 01:20:06,820
He killed the elderly.

1952
01:20:08,020 --> 01:20:09,520
What the fuck?

1953
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:11,400
Go.

1954
01:20:12,240 --> 01:20:14,180
Search for the golden banana comp.

1955
01:20:14,640 --> 01:20:16,920
Did he just kill the elderly?

1956
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:19,960
Sigh.

1957
01:20:20,500 --> 01:20:21,840
Of course, sire.

1958
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:22,880
Bro.

1959
01:20:23,380 --> 01:20:25,460
You just threw him in the air.

1960
01:20:26,500 --> 01:20:28,240
About time you showed up, Mario.

1961
01:20:28,940 --> 01:20:32,800
You're just in time to witness the retrieval of the great golden banana.

1962
01:20:33,620 --> 01:20:34,000
Comic.

1963
01:20:34,860 --> 01:20:38,460
I found the golden banana, your rancidness.

1964
01:20:38,460 --> 01:20:39,220
Here.

1965
01:20:39,460 --> 01:20:41,220
Please take it off my closet, Eddie.

1966
01:20:41,960 --> 01:20:42,600
Ha ha ha.

1967
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:45,320
Just like taking banana from a monkey.

1968
01:20:46,100 --> 01:20:47,200
Why is it wet?

1969
01:20:48,540 --> 01:20:49,300
Now and then.

1970
01:20:49,660 --> 01:20:50,020
Mario.

1971
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:53,440
As I was saying, it's about time you showed up.

1972
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:55,660
And he's joined by me.

1973
01:20:55,880 --> 01:20:57,220
Captain Toad.

1974
01:21:00,840 --> 01:21:01,600
Right.

1975
01:21:02,940 --> 01:21:04,960
I've been here the whole time.

1976
01:21:07,330 --> 01:21:07,750
What about me?

1977
01:21:08,290 --> 01:21:10,570
Nobody forgets Captain Toad.

1978
01:21:10,850 --> 01:21:11,530
Ha ha ha.

1979
01:21:12,010 --> 01:21:12,770
It's

1980
01:21:16,730 --> 01:21:18,530
the game in this entire world.

1981
01:21:19,430 --> 01:21:20,150
Let me think.

1982
01:21:21,130 --> 01:21:22,050
Ha ha ha.

1983
01:21:22,710 --> 01:21:23,790
Captain who?

1984
01:21:24,890 --> 01:21:26,370
Ha ha ha.

1985
01:21:26,770 --> 01:21:27,730
That's silly.

1986
01:21:28,270 --> 01:21:28,650
Ha ha.

1987
01:21:28,770 --> 01:21:29,450
That's mean.

1988
01:21:29,530 --> 01:21:30,310
No, I agree.

1989
01:21:30,870 --> 01:21:31,390
Ha ha.

1990
01:21:31,970 --> 01:21:32,670
Ha ha ha.

1991
01:21:33,150 --> 01:21:34,530
Actual the plus one.

1992
01:21:35,210 --> 01:21:36,170
Oh, he's gone.

1993
01:21:36,630 --> 01:21:36,950
Ha ha.

1994
01:21:37,970 --> 01:21:39,310
I'm laying right here.

1995
01:21:39,670 --> 01:21:40,490
Ha ha ha.

1996
01:21:42,010 --> 01:21:43,430
Enough of this retrieval.

1997
01:21:43,750 --> 01:21:44,610
I already forgot.

1998
01:21:44,830 --> 01:21:48,010
If Captain Toad did not piss me off, I would also forget him.

1999
01:21:48,850 --> 01:21:50,070
Mero, thank you for the super chat.

2000
01:21:50,170 --> 01:21:50,350
Thank you.

2001
01:21:50,450 --> 01:21:50,810
Thank you.

2002
01:21:50,890 --> 01:21:56,050
I just realized the live action Mario movie from the 80s confirms dinosaurs are a thing in the Mario universe.

2003
01:21:56,910 --> 01:21:58,990
Yes, your potassium, this is.

2004
01:21:59,620 --> 01:22:01,690
It's time for a wild battle strategy.

2005
01:22:02,070 --> 01:22:03,310
Destroy Mario.

2006
01:22:04,490 --> 01:22:05,570
Mario, I have an idea.

2007
01:22:05,770 --> 01:22:06,410
Play along.

2008
01:22:07,510 --> 01:22:08,810
You're in for it now.

2009
01:22:09,490 --> 01:22:11,530
Comic, taught me about spread moves.

2010
01:22:11,530 --> 01:22:13,550
Wait, what the fuck is spread moves?

2011
01:22:14,270 --> 01:22:15,330
Wait, teach me too.

2012
01:22:15,830 --> 01:22:16,470
Ha ha ha.

2013
01:22:18,910 --> 01:22:20,930
Wait, also teach me what that means.

2014
01:22:22,790 --> 01:22:24,750
Oh, is that AOE attacks?

2015
01:22:25,670 --> 01:22:28,230
Why is comic like just as big as Bowser?

2016
01:22:28,370 --> 01:22:29,130
What the fuck is he?

2017
01:22:29,210 --> 01:22:30,130
Are they feeding him?

2018
01:22:32,530 --> 01:22:33,090
All right.

2019
01:22:34,150 --> 01:22:36,430
You know what to do, dad.

2020
01:22:36,910 --> 01:22:39,010
You only know one move.

2021
01:22:39,290 --> 01:22:40,930
And one move only.

2022
01:22:44,390 --> 01:22:46,410
Two versus one plus.

2023
01:22:46,790 --> 01:22:47,930
Use this fungus.

2024
01:22:49,110 --> 01:22:49,450
All right.

2025
01:22:52,930 --> 01:22:54,150
Oh, shit.

2026
01:22:54,910 --> 01:22:55,750
Oh, wait.

2027
01:22:55,850 --> 01:22:56,070
Nice.

2028
01:22:57,910 --> 01:22:58,810
Good job.

2029
01:22:59,350 --> 01:23:01,190
Good job, Toad.

2030
01:23:01,410 --> 01:23:03,170
Actual good move.

2031
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:08,640
All right.

2032
01:23:08,640 --> 01:23:09,440
Thank God.

2033
01:23:09,620 --> 01:23:11,160
He actually used a good move.

2034
01:23:12,380 --> 01:23:14,040
I actually needed that.

2035
01:23:17,930 --> 01:23:18,610
All right.

2036
01:23:18,830 --> 01:23:19,410
Sandstorm.

2037
01:23:20,930 --> 01:23:21,970
Oh, my God.

2038
01:23:21,970 --> 01:23:23,510
He didn't fuck up.

2039
01:23:23,870 --> 01:23:24,430
Oh, okay.

2040
01:23:24,530 --> 01:23:26,330
Now they took away his fire.

2041
01:23:26,970 --> 01:23:28,890
I mean, it was nice using it for one move.

2042
01:23:29,050 --> 01:23:29,450
You know?

2043
01:23:33,810 --> 01:23:34,530
All right.

2044
01:23:34,630 --> 01:23:35,070
What else?

2045
01:23:36,410 --> 01:23:37,290
Spike top?

2046
01:23:37,570 --> 01:23:38,010
Oh!

2047
01:23:38,570 --> 01:23:39,710
Wait, he's upside down.

2048
01:23:41,690 --> 01:23:43,330
I'm going to squish him.

2049
01:23:43,490 --> 01:23:43,970
Nice!

2050
01:23:44,210 --> 01:23:44,410
Okay.

2051
01:23:44,770 --> 01:23:46,530
You have three other moves.

2052
01:23:47,390 --> 01:23:48,230
Hammer pro.

2053
01:23:49,330 --> 01:23:50,810
I mean, that's all right.

2054
01:23:51,070 --> 01:23:52,130
I mean, it works for me.

2055
01:23:52,730 --> 01:23:54,290
I'm them using fire.

2056
01:23:54,690 --> 01:23:55,770
It works for me anyway.

2057
01:23:59,330 --> 01:24:02,130
Just remember, you have three other moves.

2058
01:24:04,890 --> 01:24:05,650
K-pop.

2059
01:24:05,810 --> 01:24:06,830
Thank you for the super chat.

2060
01:24:06,970 --> 01:24:07,150
Thank you.

2061
01:24:07,310 --> 01:24:07,710
Thank you.

2062
01:24:07,770 --> 01:24:09,030
How dare you suggest it.

2063
01:24:09,030 --> 01:24:10,710
This movie is canon.

2064
01:24:13,390 --> 01:24:13,990
All right.

2065
01:24:14,710 --> 01:24:16,150
It's not very effective.

2066
01:24:20,350 --> 01:24:20,970
All right.

2067
01:24:21,530 --> 01:24:22,670
Oh, he sent himself.

2068
01:24:23,430 --> 01:24:25,570
But he doesn't wear a hat when he's himself.

2069
01:24:25,770 --> 01:24:27,410
Does he, like, take off his hat?

2070
01:24:27,970 --> 01:24:29,530
When he sends himself out?

2071
01:24:32,370 --> 01:24:33,090
Okay, nice.

2072
01:24:33,190 --> 01:24:34,090
He actually used a different...

2073
01:24:34,090 --> 01:24:34,970
I got a little worried.

2074
01:24:35,270 --> 01:24:36,850
I thought he was gonna, you know...

2075
01:24:36,850 --> 01:24:37,390
Oh, okay.

2076
01:24:37,390 --> 01:24:40,070
I thought he was, you know, still gonna use that one move.

2077
01:24:40,770 --> 01:24:42,290
Still gonna use Sunny Day.

2078
01:24:44,110 --> 01:24:46,350
Because I know they said, like...

2079
01:24:46,350 --> 01:24:48,370
Uh, Captain Toad is a little buggy.

2080
01:24:48,730 --> 01:24:50,950
Where he'll always spam weather moves.

2081
01:24:55,730 --> 01:24:58,330
Yeah, he put on his fighting hat.

2082
01:24:59,130 --> 01:25:00,870
A hat for every occasion.

2083
01:25:01,770 --> 01:25:02,350
All right.

2084
01:25:02,490 --> 01:25:03,510
Now it's 2v1.

2085
01:25:10,460 --> 01:25:11,620
Yeah, I got...

2086
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:13,640
I got, like...

2087
01:25:13,640 --> 01:25:14,800
I won't say lazy.

2088
01:25:15,040 --> 01:25:16,480
I just, like...

2089
01:25:16,480 --> 01:25:19,720
I got really confused on how to, like...

2090
01:25:19,720 --> 01:25:20,420
Patch it.

2091
01:25:20,860 --> 01:25:24,000
Because you apparently have to patch the ROM file.

2092
01:25:24,500 --> 01:25:26,280
And then I got scared.

2093
01:25:26,640 --> 01:25:28,060
Because it wasn't one click.

2094
01:25:28,680 --> 01:25:30,120
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

2095
01:25:30,860 --> 01:25:32,240
Because I was like...

2096
01:25:32,240 --> 01:25:35,440
How do I move my save file over?

2097
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:37,060
And then I got...

2098
01:25:37,060 --> 01:25:38,720
I got really confused.

2099
01:25:39,140 --> 01:25:40,200
And then I was like...

2100
01:25:40,200 --> 01:25:41,120
Not one click.

2101
01:25:41,380 --> 01:25:42,620
I not do.

2102
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:49,840
Yeah, I didn't want my save file to get deleted.

2103
01:25:56,270 --> 01:25:56,950
Oh my god.

2104
01:25:57,050 --> 01:25:57,870
He sent himself already?

2105
01:25:59,070 --> 01:26:00,290
There's, like, two more.

2106
01:26:00,670 --> 01:26:01,850
Wait, he's fire, right?

2107
01:26:03,370 --> 01:26:04,790
I think Bowser's fire.

2108
01:26:05,030 --> 01:26:05,350
He has...

2109
01:26:05,350 --> 01:26:06,170
Okay, never mind.

2110
01:26:09,470 --> 01:26:10,790
He has to be fire.

2111
01:26:11,090 --> 01:26:12,910
He literally spits out fireballs.

2112
01:26:14,150 --> 01:26:15,390
What do you mean, go Bowser?

2113
01:26:15,830 --> 01:26:17,310
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

2114
01:26:20,510 --> 01:26:21,770
What the fuck do you mean?

2115
01:26:22,130 --> 01:26:23,310
Go Bowser.

2116
01:26:23,850 --> 01:26:24,630
Ha ha ha ha.

2117
01:26:27,030 --> 01:26:27,870
Oh, he's drag...

2118
01:26:27,870 --> 01:26:28,730
He's not even fire?

2119
01:26:29,150 --> 01:26:30,510
I thought he'd be fire type.

2120
01:26:30,750 --> 01:26:31,350
Because he's...

2121
01:26:31,350 --> 01:26:33,330
He literally spits out fire.

2122
01:26:43,210 --> 01:26:43,670
Okay.

2123
01:26:44,190 --> 01:26:45,230
Wait, Ice was...

2124
01:26:45,230 --> 01:26:47,150
Oh, I guess Ice is effective on...

2125
01:26:47,150 --> 01:26:49,350
Jesus Christ, he's so fucking tanky.

2126
01:26:51,850 --> 01:26:53,830
Okay, apparently he doesn't get critical hit.

2127
01:26:54,030 --> 01:26:54,590
I'll just sit.

2128
01:26:55,510 --> 01:26:55,990
Yeah.

2129
01:26:56,390 --> 01:26:57,530
Oh my god, it's not...

2130
01:26:57,530 --> 01:26:58,150
I knew it!

2131
01:26:58,290 --> 01:26:59,550
It's not effective at all!

2132
01:27:01,110 --> 01:27:01,590
Yeah.

2133
01:27:08,190 --> 01:27:11,030
Jesus, thank god I'm, like, ten levels ahead.

2134
01:27:16,810 --> 01:27:17,730
Alright, goodbye.

2135
01:27:18,230 --> 01:27:19,030
Oh, never mind.

2136
01:27:24,750 --> 01:27:26,530
I'll just use Crash Chop.

2137
01:27:27,810 --> 01:27:28,870
Nice, that's fine.

2138
01:27:29,530 --> 01:27:29,870
That's...

2139
01:27:29,870 --> 01:27:30,490
Yeah, I knew it.

2140
01:27:30,570 --> 01:27:30,950
That's fine.

2141
01:27:31,210 --> 01:27:31,850
It should be okay.

2142
01:27:32,070 --> 01:27:33,430
Yeah, because, like, he's also fire.

2143
01:27:33,930 --> 01:27:34,290
Chop!

2144
01:27:34,290 --> 01:27:34,310
Chop!

2145
01:27:35,150 --> 01:27:35,550
Yeah!

2146
01:27:41,200 --> 01:27:42,100
I'm doing great.

2147
01:27:50,290 --> 01:27:50,730
Alright.

2148
01:27:51,030 --> 01:27:51,990
One last mod.

2149
01:27:52,530 --> 01:27:53,710
Who is he gonna send?

2150
01:27:55,090 --> 01:27:56,010
It can't be...

2151
01:27:56,010 --> 01:27:56,730
Oh yeah, there you go.

2152
01:27:56,970 --> 01:27:57,630
Mecha Koopa.

2153
01:27:57,770 --> 01:27:59,370
I was gonna say, it can't be that strong.

2154
01:27:59,550 --> 01:28:00,030
Because I literally...

2155
01:28:01,630 --> 01:28:04,570
Like, he literally, for some reason, sent out himself.

2156
01:28:04,790 --> 01:28:05,710
Like, second.

2157
01:28:07,230 --> 01:28:07,870
Yay!

2158
01:28:09,890 --> 01:28:11,230
I did it!

2159
01:28:11,410 --> 01:28:12,910
I'm the main character!

2160
01:28:14,090 --> 01:28:16,050
It's always year of the...

2161
01:28:16,050 --> 01:28:17,490
Like, year of Mario.

2162
01:28:17,490 --> 01:28:17,670
Mario.

2163
01:28:19,830 --> 01:28:20,650
Alright, Bowser.

2164
01:28:21,090 --> 01:28:23,550
Spread moves can also hit me, you know?

2165
01:28:23,730 --> 01:28:25,390
I don't even think they used a spread move.

2166
01:28:25,450 --> 01:28:27,430
Because I just kept killing them one by one.

2167
01:28:30,830 --> 01:28:31,350
Comic!

2168
01:28:31,710 --> 01:28:33,050
What kind of battling was that?

2169
01:28:33,490 --> 01:28:36,490
Your captors couldn't last more than two turns against Mario!

2170
01:28:37,890 --> 01:28:38,930
But, sire...

2171
01:28:38,930 --> 01:28:40,330
I don't want to hear it.

2172
01:28:40,330 --> 01:28:43,970
I want a full battle report on how you could have performed better.

2173
01:28:44,570 --> 01:28:46,170
Yeah, he didn't even use the spread move.

2174
01:28:46,630 --> 01:28:47,790
But, no matter.

2175
01:28:48,110 --> 01:28:51,550
With this golden banana, our teams can come back to full strength.

2176
01:28:54,390 --> 01:28:54,910
What?

2177
01:28:55,190 --> 01:28:56,650
Where is my golden banana?

2178
01:28:57,470 --> 01:28:59,330
Why, you little...

2179
01:29:00,410 --> 01:29:00,930
Ah!

2180
01:29:01,530 --> 01:29:03,550
You lost all your leverage, Bowser!

2181
01:29:04,050 --> 01:29:04,790
Give up!

2182
01:29:05,910 --> 01:29:08,270
I would listen to the mushroom if I were you.

2183
01:29:09,530 --> 01:29:14,750
It's Donkey Kong, and with his ass in Capiton's face!

2184
01:29:20,710 --> 01:29:22,330
The Kong!

2185
01:29:22,530 --> 01:29:23,810
The Kong Army!

2186
01:29:24,790 --> 01:29:28,190
I don't know how you can see past that.

2187
01:29:30,470 --> 01:29:34,330
The face full of cheek.

2188
01:29:35,390 --> 01:29:37,330
The dump truck Kong.

2189
01:29:38,410 --> 01:29:44,570
We would have come sooner, but we wanted to watch DK beat the one-up out of Luigi some more.

2190
01:29:44,830 --> 01:29:45,650
Oh my god!

2191
01:29:46,050 --> 01:29:47,310
Wait, what?

2192
01:29:47,810 --> 01:29:50,430
Poor fucking Luigi!

2193
01:29:51,390 --> 01:29:54,890
The bro of Donkey Kong was beating up Luigi?

2194
01:29:56,130 --> 01:29:59,250
We're getting some Smash Bros action already.

2195
01:30:00,030 --> 01:30:01,410
So that's where he's been.

2196
01:30:03,190 --> 01:30:07,690
Look, I think it's best for you to make like a couple of bananas and split!

2197
01:30:07,690 --> 01:30:08,270
Ha!

2198
01:30:09,390 --> 01:30:11,370
That's funny, I should write that down.

2199
01:30:12,890 --> 01:30:13,530
Kongs!

2200
01:30:14,270 --> 01:30:14,830
Ooh!

2201
01:30:16,430 --> 01:30:17,470
Yeah, yeah.

2202
01:30:17,930 --> 01:30:18,830
We get it.

2203
01:30:21,330 --> 01:30:23,930
We'll be seeing you again soon, Mario.

2204
01:30:25,070 --> 01:30:26,010
Ha ha ha ha!

2205
01:30:28,610 --> 01:30:36,630
Mario and Captain Toad, thank you so much for driving Bowser out of here and keeping the golden banana out of his grasp.

2206
01:30:36,930 --> 01:30:39,090
I'll be taking that back now.

2207
01:30:40,610 --> 01:30:42,010
Sabina, thank you to the super chat.

2208
01:30:42,130 --> 01:30:42,950
Thank you, thank you.

2209
01:30:43,070 --> 01:30:44,690
Your toad voice is amazing.

2210
01:30:44,690 --> 01:30:45,390
Thank you.

2211
01:30:46,310 --> 01:30:46,870
Thank you.

2212
01:30:47,150 --> 01:30:48,210
I just chatted on my...

2213
01:30:48,210 --> 01:30:49,830
Everyone has an inner toad.

2214
01:30:50,110 --> 01:30:55,290
I basically like use my March Simpson voice and just like scream it.

2215
01:30:55,850 --> 01:30:56,390
Ha ha ha ha!

2216
01:30:57,010 --> 01:30:57,390
Mmm!

2217
01:30:58,350 --> 01:30:58,910
Homie!

2218
01:30:59,350 --> 01:30:59,990
Ha ha ha!

2219
01:30:59,990 --> 01:31:02,750
I am your character, like, homie!

2220
01:31:03,350 --> 01:31:03,770
And then...

2221
01:31:03,770 --> 01:31:06,250
And then toad voice would be like...

2222
01:31:06,250 --> 01:31:06,450
Ah!

2223
01:31:06,610 --> 01:31:07,230
Homie!

2224
01:31:07,550 --> 01:31:11,470
Ha ha ha ha!

2225
01:31:11,470 --> 01:31:13,030
Ha ha ha ha!

2226
01:31:14,690 --> 01:31:16,370
Now enough monkeying around!

2227
01:31:16,830 --> 01:31:17,630
Ha ha ha!

2228
01:31:19,030 --> 01:31:20,630
Ha ha ha ha ha!

2229
01:31:21,810 --> 01:31:23,030
You see what I did there?

2230
01:31:24,150 --> 01:31:25,670
We're monkeys.

2231
01:31:26,110 --> 01:31:26,790
So...

2232
01:31:26,790 --> 01:31:27,810
Monkeying around.

2233
01:31:28,070 --> 01:31:30,590
But we're actually not Kongs!

2234
01:31:30,790 --> 01:31:31,590
Ha ha ha!

2235
01:31:31,590 --> 01:31:32,410
Or apes!

2236
01:31:32,410 --> 01:31:33,410
Not monkeys!

2237
01:31:33,870 --> 01:31:34,190
Ha ha ha!

2238
01:31:34,190 --> 01:31:35,030
I cracked myself...

2239
01:31:35,030 --> 01:31:36,290
Oh my god, he's basically me!

2240
01:31:36,610 --> 01:31:38,310
I always make myself laugh!

2241
01:31:39,370 --> 01:31:39,930
Flyer!

2242
01:31:40,090 --> 01:31:40,610
I have a...

2243
01:31:40,610 --> 01:31:42,610
I have a weekly comedy night!

2244
01:31:43,790 --> 01:31:46,250
The quest, Monkeying Around, is now active.

2245
01:31:46,610 --> 01:31:50,550
The palace is now open for you to challenge Donkey Kong for the power star.

2246
01:31:50,870 --> 01:31:51,850
Be ready!

2247
01:31:52,350 --> 01:31:53,030
Ha ha ha!

2248
01:31:55,210 --> 01:31:57,170
I feel like I'm forgetting something.

2249
01:31:58,130 --> 01:31:58,330
Ah!

2250
01:31:58,670 --> 01:31:58,850
Eh!

2251
01:31:59,170 --> 01:31:59,410
Oh!

2252
01:31:59,850 --> 01:32:02,270
Wait, Donkey Kong can't speak Mushroomlish?

2253
01:32:03,590 --> 01:32:04,350
That's right!

2254
01:32:05,630 --> 01:32:07,650
You'll need this to climb the waterfall.

2255
01:32:08,350 --> 01:32:09,590
Oh, I got a jet attachment.

2256
01:32:10,090 --> 01:32:12,950
There's a river pat behind you that can take you back to the capital.

2257
01:32:13,590 --> 01:32:17,310
If you ask me, it's a great way to escape!

2258
01:32:17,790 --> 01:32:18,350
Ha ha ha!

2259
01:32:20,790 --> 01:32:23,510
Actually, apes and escape has the word ape in it.

2260
01:32:23,890 --> 01:32:25,430
Everyone's gonna love that one.

2261
01:32:25,970 --> 01:32:27,310
I'm on fire!

2262
01:32:27,590 --> 01:32:29,770
Donkey Kong is illiterate!

2263
01:32:30,590 --> 01:32:31,790
Ha ha ha!

2264
01:32:31,910 --> 01:32:32,430
Cheeky!

2265
01:32:32,570 --> 01:32:34,810
I think that's my best one so far.

2266
01:32:35,770 --> 01:32:36,490
Where am I?

2267
01:32:36,830 --> 01:32:40,390
I think it's time for me to head back on the toad town!

2268
01:32:40,870 --> 01:32:42,370
Don't look so sad!

2269
01:32:42,930 --> 01:32:43,670
Oh, what?

2270
01:32:43,790 --> 01:32:44,630
Do I look sad?

2271
01:32:44,870 --> 01:32:47,070
No, I'm crying tears of joy right now.

2272
01:32:47,350 --> 01:32:48,450
We'll see each other again.

2273
01:32:48,450 --> 01:32:49,230
No, no, no.

2274
01:32:49,270 --> 01:32:50,410
I hope I never see you.

2275
01:32:50,470 --> 01:32:53,730
If you die in a car crash, I will send flowers.

2276
01:32:54,390 --> 01:32:56,350
But not because I feel bad.

2277
01:32:57,230 --> 01:32:58,030
For another adventure!

2278
01:32:58,190 --> 01:33:00,010
Oh, and here's a little gift for me too!

2279
01:33:01,390 --> 01:33:02,590
Oh, all those captures?

2280
01:33:02,670 --> 01:33:04,110
You mean the one capture?

2281
01:33:05,590 --> 01:33:06,370
Recycle Bin.

2282
01:33:06,470 --> 01:33:07,290
Thank you for the super chat.

2283
01:33:07,410 --> 01:33:08,050
Thank you, thank you.

2284
01:33:08,150 --> 01:33:09,150
Donkey Kong.

2285
01:33:09,630 --> 01:33:10,110
Oh, sorry.

2286
01:33:10,190 --> 01:33:11,990
I meant Mario Kart crash.

2287
01:33:12,530 --> 01:33:13,350
Don't worry.

2288
01:33:13,710 --> 01:33:14,690
Ha ha ha ha!

2289
01:33:15,070 --> 01:33:15,970
He's okay.

2290
01:33:16,430 --> 01:33:18,830
I meant Mario Kart crash, guys.

2291
01:33:19,170 --> 01:33:20,190
I think...

2292
01:33:20,190 --> 01:33:21,770
I think I've been dreaming of my party!

2293
01:33:22,290 --> 01:33:24,070
And bang, we better use to have them!

2294
01:33:24,310 --> 01:33:30,310
I said to the last box of your PC that I'm keeping my Hammer Pro and Power Glows!

2295
01:33:30,790 --> 01:33:33,850
Now get those Power Stars before Bowser and Luigi do!

2296
01:33:34,110 --> 01:33:35,570
Good luck, Mario!

2297
01:33:36,030 --> 01:33:38,290
Anyway, I'm looking forward for Garfield Kart 2.

2298
01:33:38,550 --> 01:33:40,750
I saw so many people at me.

2299
01:33:40,970 --> 01:33:43,250
Yeah, for Garfield Kart 2.

2300
01:33:43,570 --> 01:33:44,890
Everyone's like...

2301
01:33:44,890 --> 01:33:45,490
Oh, my God!

2302
01:33:45,730 --> 01:33:46,210
Jokey!

2303
01:33:46,810 --> 01:33:47,610
Ha ha ha ha!

2304
01:33:48,850 --> 01:33:49,410
Garp...

2305
01:33:49,410 --> 01:33:50,170
Wait, he's back!

2306
01:33:50,910 --> 01:33:51,390
What's that?

2307
01:33:51,570 --> 01:33:52,770
Come on, here safely.

2308
01:33:53,350 --> 01:33:57,390
But you don't get to be the guardian of the Golden Benet while earning such a position.

2309
01:33:58,010 --> 01:34:03,490
After I got launched by that Magi Koopa, I snuck back in and head out until everything blew over.

2310
01:34:03,490 --> 01:34:06,990
I also got to dodge Cranky Kong while I was at it.

2311
01:34:08,050 --> 01:34:10,590
I am the guardian of the Golden Banana.

2312
01:34:11,010 --> 01:34:12,950
Keeper of the ways of the WoW battle.

2313
01:34:13,410 --> 01:34:16,090
Would you like me to teach your captures a special move?

2314
01:34:16,310 --> 01:34:17,470
What's the fire pledge?

2315
01:34:18,030 --> 01:34:18,990
What's coaching?

2316
01:34:19,250 --> 01:34:20,150
What the fuck?

2317
01:34:22,110 --> 01:34:23,350
Oh, they're like...

2318
01:34:23,350 --> 01:34:25,450
Oh, they're like moves that he could teach.

2319
01:34:25,610 --> 01:34:25,890
Yeah, no.

2320
01:34:26,210 --> 01:34:26,690
That's fine.

2321
01:34:26,690 --> 01:34:27,690
I don't need those moves.

2322
01:34:28,230 --> 01:34:29,850
Alright, time to get stick bugged!

2323
01:34:31,790 --> 01:34:32,910
Ha ha ha!

2324
01:34:33,610 --> 01:34:36,110
You'll never escape stick bug.

2325
01:34:39,110 --> 01:34:40,470
Oh my god.

2326
01:34:42,210 --> 01:34:44,170
Oh my god.

2327
01:34:45,670 --> 01:34:49,250
At this point, I might get a rappel just for these guys.

2328
01:34:50,430 --> 01:34:51,590
Wait, where am I...

2329
01:34:51,590 --> 01:34:52,710
Am I going the right way?

2330
01:34:54,530 --> 01:34:56,150
Wait, it's a scuttlebug.

2331
01:34:56,610 --> 01:34:57,730
Oh my god.

2332
01:34:57,990 --> 01:34:59,110
That's what they look like?

2333
01:34:59,950 --> 01:35:01,570
I've just seen the purple one.

2334
01:35:01,650 --> 01:35:02,170
So I don't...

2335
01:35:02,170 --> 01:35:03,970
I never realized what the actual...

2336
01:35:03,970 --> 01:35:05,370
What the other one looked like.

2337
01:35:05,610 --> 01:35:06,630
The color was.

2338
01:35:10,270 --> 01:35:11,170
Oh my...

2339
01:35:11,170 --> 01:35:11,490
I'm...

2340
01:35:11,490 --> 01:35:12,890
I'm putting on the rappel.

2341
01:35:13,010 --> 01:35:13,690
I can't...

2342
01:35:13,690 --> 01:35:14,670
I can't...

2343
01:35:14,670 --> 01:35:15,990
I got scuttlebugged.

2344
01:35:20,090 --> 01:35:21,110
Is this it?

2345
01:35:21,890 --> 01:35:23,190
Wait, this is also another...

2346
01:35:23,190 --> 01:35:24,550
Hey Mario, it's me.

2347
01:35:24,990 --> 01:35:25,810
Okay, I'll take a photo.

2348
01:35:29,810 --> 01:35:30,370
Okay.

2349
01:35:32,450 --> 01:35:34,670
I actually don't know if I'm going the right way.

2350
01:35:35,270 --> 01:35:35,750
Whoa!

2351
01:35:36,270 --> 01:35:36,830
Mama!

2352
01:35:37,730 --> 01:35:39,130
I'm catching you.

2353
01:35:40,210 --> 01:35:41,170
Oh my god.

2354
01:35:41,310 --> 01:35:42,510
And your tongue is out?

2355
01:35:42,670 --> 01:35:43,430
You're perfect.

2356
01:35:44,270 --> 01:35:44,830
Perfect.

2357
01:35:47,190 --> 01:35:48,750
Does he don't lick too?

2358
01:35:50,650 --> 01:35:51,490
That's the Deadpool.

2359
01:35:51,750 --> 01:35:53,430
Thank you for the five gifted chips.

2360
01:35:53,610 --> 01:35:53,970
Thank you.

2361
01:35:54,090 --> 01:35:54,710
Thank you.

2362
01:35:56,690 --> 01:35:57,850
What's that tongue do?

2363
01:35:57,970 --> 01:35:58,570
I don't know.

2364
01:35:58,850 --> 01:36:01,530
But I know some goons who are going to look forward to that.

2365
01:36:03,810 --> 01:36:04,710
Who was it?

2366
01:36:04,770 --> 01:36:05,490
There was one.

2367
01:36:05,830 --> 01:36:08,430
I know there was a guy here that was like...

2368
01:36:08,430 --> 01:36:10,110
I have very low self-esteem.

2369
01:36:10,270 --> 01:36:11,950
So can I be named after something?

2370
01:36:12,210 --> 01:36:13,110
And I was like, okay.

2371
01:36:16,610 --> 01:36:17,050
Alright.

2372
01:36:17,590 --> 01:36:18,890
I'm trying to find it.

2373
01:36:21,050 --> 01:36:22,430
Where is it?

2374
01:36:23,390 --> 01:36:24,670
Where are you?

2375
01:36:26,770 --> 01:36:27,990
I'm trying to...

2376
01:36:29,450 --> 01:36:30,170
Oh my...

2377
01:36:30,170 --> 01:36:31,150
You're simple-minded?

2378
01:36:31,450 --> 01:36:32,310
Simple-minded!

2379
01:36:32,890 --> 01:36:33,490
If it's...

2380
01:36:33,490 --> 01:36:34,010
Exactly!

2381
01:36:34,470 --> 01:36:35,510
There you go.

2382
01:36:35,690 --> 01:36:37,430
I remember you, simple-minded.

2383
01:36:39,970 --> 01:36:40,610
Alright.

2384
01:36:40,790 --> 01:36:41,730
Let's get you in here.

2385
01:36:43,250 --> 01:36:44,090
Oh wait.

2386
01:36:44,230 --> 01:36:45,110
Now you can crunch?

2387
01:36:45,890 --> 01:36:46,950
Jesus Christ.

2388
01:36:47,290 --> 01:36:47,410
Okay.

2389
01:36:47,970 --> 01:36:48,310
Whoa.

2390
01:36:49,090 --> 01:36:50,710
Oh, it takes two...

2391
01:36:50,710 --> 01:36:51,850
To three turns.

2392
01:36:52,010 --> 01:36:53,470
Yeah, we're not doing that.

2393
01:36:54,130 --> 01:36:55,330
I'm impatient.

2394
01:36:56,810 --> 01:36:58,370
Hobita, thank you for the super chat.

2395
01:36:58,510 --> 01:36:59,270
Thank you.

2396
01:36:59,430 --> 01:37:01,050
Mama goes well with that.

2397
01:37:03,170 --> 01:37:03,770
Alright.

2398
01:37:03,770 --> 01:37:07,330
A two-legged salamander with an endless appetite.

2399
01:37:07,710 --> 01:37:10,670
It opens its mouth wide and charges towards its next dinner.

2400
01:37:10,930 --> 01:37:14,210
It's my best friend and perfect in every way.

2401
01:37:14,990 --> 01:37:15,670
Alright.

2402
01:37:15,670 --> 01:37:16,410
Let's see.

2403
01:37:17,210 --> 01:37:18,570
Simple goon.

2404
01:37:22,610 --> 01:37:23,290
Simple...

2405
01:37:26,430 --> 01:37:27,110
Goon.

2406
01:37:27,110 --> 01:37:27,910
Oh my god.

2407
01:37:27,950 --> 01:37:29,010
And it's female, too.

2408
01:37:30,310 --> 01:37:30,650
Alright.

2409
01:37:30,770 --> 01:37:31,890
Let's make sure he's in the...

2410
01:37:31,890 --> 01:37:33,110
She's in the right box.

2411
01:37:36,430 --> 01:37:37,070
Alright.

2412
01:37:38,750 --> 01:37:40,030
Waiting for...

2413
01:37:40,030 --> 01:37:41,690
I'm just lining them up.

2414
01:37:46,690 --> 01:37:49,210
Just waiting for their next customer.

2415
01:37:51,810 --> 01:37:52,450
Oh!

2416
01:37:52,930 --> 01:37:53,630
Maisie D!

2417
01:37:54,070 --> 01:37:55,110
Oh, it's this one!

2418
01:37:55,110 --> 01:37:56,110
This one's cute.

2419
01:37:56,430 --> 01:37:57,470
I like this one.

2420
01:37:58,530 --> 01:38:00,950
You just get to be in the private Xbox.

2421
01:38:03,310 --> 01:38:03,950
Oh.

2422
01:38:04,950 --> 01:38:06,050
Zzzz time.

2423
01:38:07,330 --> 01:38:07,970
Zzzz.

2424
01:38:08,970 --> 01:38:10,430
He's a-sleeping.

2425
01:38:11,590 --> 01:38:12,490
Oh, okay.

2426
01:38:12,790 --> 01:38:13,430
I got...

2427
01:38:13,430 --> 01:38:15,150
Okay, I actually got a...

2428
01:38:15,150 --> 01:38:16,530
Alright, you know what to do.

2429
01:38:17,550 --> 01:38:18,050
Hahaha.

2430
01:38:21,550 --> 01:38:22,190
Nyaoshi!

2431
01:38:24,470 --> 01:38:25,230
Alright.

2432
01:38:27,970 --> 01:38:29,130
This is like...

2433
01:38:29,130 --> 01:38:31,010
Guys, it's my weakest move.

2434
01:38:31,350 --> 01:38:32,110
Nyaoshi!

2435
01:38:32,110 --> 01:38:32,150
Nyaoshi!

2436
01:38:35,840 --> 01:38:36,120
Nyaoshi!

2437
01:38:37,080 --> 01:38:37,840
Okay.

2438
01:38:38,120 --> 01:38:38,980
Maybe I'll...

2439
01:38:38,980 --> 01:38:40,460
No, I pressed B.

2440
01:38:40,760 --> 01:38:43,260
I accidentally pressed B.

2441
01:38:43,540 --> 01:38:44,300
I...

2442
01:38:47,240 --> 01:38:50,480
I accidentally pressed B instead of A.

2443
01:38:51,780 --> 01:38:53,380
I'm so sad.

2444
01:38:53,840 --> 01:38:56,100
I wasted... Oh my god, no!

2445
01:38:56,340 --> 01:39:00,220
Don't tell me those are rare captures too!

2446
01:39:01,600 --> 01:39:03,520
Of course it is!

2447
01:39:03,880 --> 01:39:06,280
Of course it's a rare capture!

2448
01:39:06,520 --> 01:39:07,580
Oh my god!

2449
01:39:12,280 --> 01:39:13,000
No!

2450
01:39:16,460 --> 01:39:18,780
Of course you're a rare capture!

2451
01:39:18,780 --> 01:39:22,800
Of course I only fuck up when it's a rare one!

2452
01:39:25,100 --> 01:39:27,220
Oh my god, it was!

2453
01:39:28,120 --> 01:39:29,120
It was!

2454
01:39:34,200 --> 01:39:35,340
I'm so sad.

2455
01:39:35,700 --> 01:39:38,020
How do I always manage to do that to myself?

2456
01:39:42,320 --> 01:39:43,900
There's something else here too.

2457
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:44,940
Oh my god, I found another one!

2458
01:39:45,140 --> 01:39:46,120
Oh thank god!

2459
01:39:46,780 --> 01:39:47,020
Okay.

2460
01:39:47,020 --> 01:39:49,160
I'm gonna try throwing a cap now.

2461
01:39:52,080 --> 01:39:54,020
Oh, is she really that strong?

2462
01:39:55,800 --> 01:39:56,240
Okay.

2463
01:39:56,620 --> 01:39:59,440
It's time to... Time to do it again, Dragoon!

2464
01:40:06,690 --> 01:40:07,130
Alright.

2465
01:40:07,550 --> 01:40:09,570
If you find it again... Hannah Clarks!

2466
01:40:09,570 --> 01:40:10,490
Thank you to the super chat!

2467
01:40:10,610 --> 01:40:10,850
Thank you!

2468
01:40:11,010 --> 01:40:11,630
Thank you!

2469
01:40:13,370 --> 01:40:13,810
Alright.

2470
01:40:14,670 --> 01:40:17,410
Oh yeah, Ryuki was like, can I please be the flower?

2471
01:40:17,610 --> 01:40:18,710
And then I ran away.

2472
01:40:22,050 --> 01:40:22,650
Alright.

2473
01:40:22,710 --> 01:40:22,710
Alright.

2474
01:40:23,430 --> 01:40:24,670
Lick the flower.

2475
01:40:25,550 --> 01:40:27,310
Oh nice, it's paralyzed too.

2476
01:40:27,610 --> 01:40:27,870
Nice.

2477
01:40:28,190 --> 01:40:28,970
Can't move now.

2478
01:40:29,810 --> 01:40:30,410
That's right.

2479
01:40:30,770 --> 01:40:33,050
Break the... Break his shins!

2480
01:40:39,990 --> 01:40:40,590
Alright.

2481
01:40:40,810 --> 01:40:41,770
Now they're all asleep.

2482
01:40:42,090 --> 01:40:42,530
That's okay.

2483
01:40:42,730 --> 01:40:43,730
I can catch her now.

2484
01:40:43,910 --> 01:40:44,350
Or him.

2485
01:40:46,870 --> 01:40:47,990
Okay, never mind.

2486
01:40:48,170 --> 01:40:48,870
Apparently not.

2487
01:40:49,250 --> 01:40:50,070
You're paralyzed!

2488
01:40:50,090 --> 01:40:51,610
How are you still moving?

2489
01:40:55,130 --> 01:40:55,530
Okay.

2490
01:40:55,710 --> 01:40:56,130
Okay, there you go.

2491
01:40:56,510 --> 01:40:57,430
Are you serious?

2492
01:40:59,290 --> 01:41:02,550
I don't think I can do... I don't think I can lick the flower again.

2493
01:41:02,550 --> 01:41:03,510
Because he'll die.

2494
01:41:06,470 --> 01:41:07,510
Oh my god.

2495
01:41:07,850 --> 01:41:09,310
Oh goodbyes, Dragoon.

2496
01:41:10,710 --> 01:41:11,510
Oh my god.

2497
01:41:11,670 --> 01:41:12,470
And then it's a crate.

2498
01:41:12,610 --> 01:41:15,250
Okay, I'll send... I'll send Hefley in here.

2499
01:41:15,450 --> 01:41:17,130
There's no way Hefley can die to this.

2500
01:41:19,810 --> 01:41:20,950
Hefley, there's no way.

2501
01:41:23,910 --> 01:41:24,470
Please.

2502
01:41:24,470 --> 01:41:25,030
Please.

2503
01:41:25,190 --> 01:41:25,230
Please.

2504
01:41:25,230 --> 01:41:25,270
Please.

2505
01:41:25,270 --> 01:41:26,290
The Mafia is after me.

2506
01:41:26,350 --> 01:41:29,610
Because I spent too much... Too much of my money on these caps.

2507
01:41:29,830 --> 01:41:30,090
Please.

2508
01:41:30,530 --> 01:41:31,830
I bought 99.

2509
01:41:32,330 --> 01:41:33,470
I... Why?

2510
01:41:33,730 --> 01:41:34,270
Oh no.

2511
01:41:34,570 --> 01:41:36,730
He knows about what I do in the PC.

2512
01:41:37,730 --> 01:41:43,050
He knows what happens in the PC box.

2513
01:41:43,330 --> 01:41:44,110
He knows.

2514
01:41:46,710 --> 01:41:48,270
I swear to god.

2515
01:41:48,270 --> 01:41:50,550
He's been moving this entire time.

2516
01:41:50,550 --> 01:41:56,470
I didn't realize being paralyzed was just like... Just a statement.

2517
01:42:04,470 --> 01:42:05,190
Jesus.

2518
01:42:05,550 --> 01:42:06,210
He's fighting.

2519
01:42:06,470 --> 01:42:07,110
Oh thank god.

2520
01:42:07,410 --> 01:42:07,750
There we go.

2521
01:42:08,750 --> 01:42:11,130
This flower doesn't want to sign my NDA.

2522
01:42:11,550 --> 01:42:12,670
Sign the NDA!

2523
01:42:17,450 --> 01:42:20,670
Sign this NDA you little flower.

2524
01:42:21,530 --> 01:42:22,590
That's right.

2525
01:42:26,310 --> 01:42:27,690
NDA sign.

2526
01:42:27,710 --> 01:42:27,710
NDA sign.

2527
01:42:29,370 --> 01:42:30,070
Yay!

2528
01:42:36,950 --> 01:42:37,650
Alright.

2529
01:42:38,090 --> 01:42:38,370
Yay!

2530
01:42:41,010 --> 01:42:41,910
Oh my god.

2531
01:42:42,010 --> 01:42:42,610
Everybody's leveling.

2532
01:42:42,810 --> 01:42:43,490
Jesus Christ.

2533
01:42:43,690 --> 01:42:45,710
How strong was this fucking flower?

2534
01:42:47,870 --> 01:42:51,190
A close relative of the crazy daisy.

2535
01:42:51,510 --> 01:42:52,850
Often confused for a shiny.

2536
01:42:53,030 --> 01:42:54,850
Its strength matches his elusiveness.

2537
01:42:55,210 --> 01:42:57,190
Somehow, a crazy daisy.

2538
01:42:57,410 --> 01:42:58,810
Crazy daisy can evolve into this.

2539
01:42:59,390 --> 01:43:00,510
Holy shit.

2540
01:43:00,950 --> 01:43:03,650
This has to be some fucking god flower.

2541
01:43:05,030 --> 01:43:05,710
Alright.

2542
01:43:06,830 --> 01:43:07,390
Okay.

2543
01:43:07,470 --> 01:43:10,010
Do we give it to... Roku or Hat, guys?

2544
01:43:11,030 --> 01:43:12,410
Who do we give it to?

2545
01:43:12,690 --> 01:43:14,110
We'll let chat decide.

2546
01:43:18,830 --> 01:43:19,510
Roku?

2547
01:43:20,390 --> 01:43:21,210
That's... Okay.

2548
01:43:21,490 --> 01:43:21,930
Hat.

2549
01:43:22,430 --> 01:43:22,970
Hat.

2550
01:43:23,310 --> 01:43:23,990
Roku.

2551
01:43:24,250 --> 01:43:25,330
Combine the names.

2552
01:43:25,330 --> 01:43:29,150
There's R-O-R-O-K-K-K-K-U-H-A-T.

2553
01:43:29,290 --> 01:43:29,390
No.

2554
01:43:29,550 --> 01:43:29,710
I can't.

2555
01:43:29,950 --> 01:43:31,270
I can do Rock Hat.

2556
01:43:31,770 --> 01:43:32,430
You know what?

2557
01:43:32,490 --> 01:43:33,090
You're right.

2558
01:43:33,390 --> 01:43:34,430
You get to share.

2559
01:43:34,630 --> 01:43:35,610
It's sharing time.

2560
01:43:36,810 --> 01:43:38,250
Rock Hat.

2561
01:43:40,250 --> 01:43:40,930
Okay.

2562
01:43:43,410 --> 01:43:44,850
You're sharing custody.

2563
01:43:50,990 --> 01:43:54,110
You get to share custody of this flower.

2564
01:43:56,710 --> 01:43:57,490
Alright.

2565
01:44:00,350 --> 01:44:01,130
Alright.

2566
01:44:01,210 --> 01:44:01,210
Alright.

2567
01:44:01,370 --> 01:44:01,530
Alright.

2568
01:44:01,530 --> 01:44:03,350
Someone said to check the stats for this guy.

2569
01:44:07,750 --> 01:44:09,310
Who gets the weekend?

2570
01:44:09,490 --> 01:44:10,270
You decide.

2571
01:44:11,730 --> 01:44:13,230
Jesus Christ!

2572
01:44:14,730 --> 01:44:16,210
What the fuck?

2573
01:44:16,690 --> 01:44:18,890
His special attack is 103?

2574
01:44:21,250 --> 01:44:22,430
Holy shit.

2575
01:44:25,110 --> 01:44:25,890
Alright.

2576
01:44:27,110 --> 01:44:27,670
Wait.

2577
01:44:27,790 --> 01:44:27,790
Wait.

2578
01:44:27,790 --> 01:44:27,810
Wait.

2579
01:44:27,810 --> 01:44:27,810
Wait.

2580
01:44:27,810 --> 01:44:28,450
It's fairy, right?

2581
01:44:35,770 --> 01:44:37,010
I'm sorry, Rice.

2582
01:44:37,350 --> 01:44:38,490
You're a little useless.

2583
01:44:38,990 --> 01:44:40,570
But I'll put you in the goon cave.

2584
01:44:47,770 --> 01:44:48,730
I'm sorry.

2585
01:44:49,610 --> 01:44:51,490
Papa, thank you for the super chat.

2586
01:44:51,630 --> 01:44:51,850
Thank you.

2587
01:44:52,030 --> 01:44:52,590
Thank you.

2588
01:44:53,050 --> 01:44:56,110
What an FMA Edward did I just do?

2589
01:44:56,550 --> 01:44:57,390
It's okay.

2590
01:44:57,690 --> 01:45:00,850
But you're... You look... You have a... You... You...

2591
01:45:00,850 --> 01:45:01,930
You... You look pretty.

2592
01:45:02,750 --> 01:45:03,390
Okay.

2593
01:45:03,770 --> 01:45:10,130
But like... But like... But like... Your moveset was not the best.

2594
01:45:10,130 --> 01:45:11,030
I'll have to admit.

2595
01:45:16,990 --> 01:45:18,130
But don't worry.

2596
01:45:18,310 --> 01:45:18,750
Don't worry.

2597
01:45:19,390 --> 01:45:20,530
I'll let you pick.

2598
01:45:20,850 --> 01:45:22,310
Would you like MAMA?

2599
01:45:22,930 --> 01:45:24,970
Would you like... Wait.

2600
01:45:25,110 --> 01:45:25,770
It's rice here?

2601
01:45:26,090 --> 01:45:27,510
Would you like... Simple?

2602
01:45:27,530 --> 01:45:28,770
Or would you like Ipu?

2603
01:45:29,730 --> 01:45:30,810
You get to have...

2604
01:45:37,430 --> 01:45:39,370
I don't know if Rice is here.

2605
01:45:42,950 --> 01:45:46,470
Because Rice was in my party, okay?

2606
01:45:46,890 --> 01:45:50,430
Anyone that gets to be in my party gets to pick.

2607
01:45:52,710 --> 01:45:53,830
They're heroes.

2608
01:45:55,030 --> 01:45:55,970
Oh, Rice is in here?

2609
01:45:56,150 --> 01:45:57,390
Alright, chat, who would you pick?

2610
01:46:03,510 --> 01:46:05,850
Um, you have to say it.

2611
01:46:05,990 --> 01:46:08,190
Thank you for your service, Rice.

2612
01:46:11,890 --> 01:46:14,530
Alright, I'll give it to Mama.

2613
01:46:18,220 --> 01:46:19,600
You didn't let me choose?

2614
01:46:19,800 --> 01:46:21,400
Smug, it's because you fucked up!

2615
01:46:22,520 --> 01:46:24,020
Rice didn't fuck up!

2616
01:46:24,480 --> 01:46:25,780
You fucked up!

2617
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,300
I lost a mod in there!

2618
01:46:44,350 --> 01:46:45,550
Alright, we go this way.

2619
01:46:48,550 --> 01:46:49,870
Oh, alright, okay.

2620
01:46:50,190 --> 01:46:51,530
Rice, Rice, I see you.

2621
01:46:51,810 --> 01:46:52,610
Who do you pick?

2622
01:46:53,790 --> 01:46:55,850
Did you want Simple or Ippu?

2623
01:47:01,510 --> 01:47:02,370
Which one?

2624
01:47:02,830 --> 01:47:03,890
In fact, I'll let you pick.

2625
01:47:04,070 --> 01:47:05,530
We have so many choices.

2626
01:47:06,010 --> 01:47:13,150
We have Notsogoon, we have Delgoon, we have Wispgoon, Progoon, Yansgoon, and Kazgoon.

2627
01:47:14,390 --> 01:47:15,430
But not him.

2628
01:47:15,610 --> 01:47:18,190
This one's especially reserved to Gordongoon.

2629
01:47:18,190 --> 01:47:20,030
It's not him,

2630
01:47:23,650 --> 01:47:23,650
though.

2631
01:47:24,170 --> 01:47:25,430
Not him, though.

2632
01:47:25,930 --> 01:47:27,370
These two have to be together.

2633
01:47:28,810 --> 01:47:30,150
Those two are faded.

2634
01:47:35,510 --> 01:47:37,290
So many choices!

2635
01:47:38,090 --> 01:47:39,770
Not so technical!

2636
01:47:40,370 --> 01:47:41,870
Thank you for the super chat!

2637
01:47:42,050 --> 01:47:44,010
I know, it's so hard to pick.

2638
01:47:44,270 --> 01:47:46,930
We have a wide selection of goons here.

2639
01:47:46,930 --> 01:47:49,150
Ha ha ha ha ha!

2640
01:47:50,910 --> 01:47:51,590
Gordon...

2641
01:47:51,590 --> 01:47:52,970
Gordon like...

2642
01:47:52,970 --> 01:47:53,970
Um...

2643
01:47:53,970 --> 01:47:54,450
Oh, okay.

2644
01:47:54,570 --> 01:47:55,070
There you go.

2645
01:47:55,390 --> 01:47:57,010
Congratulations, E Drag pixels.

2646
01:47:57,790 --> 01:47:59,070
You're back to...

2647
01:47:59,070 --> 01:48:00,470
You can go back to work now.

2648
01:48:01,570 --> 01:48:05,410
Gordon paid extra for this particular goon.

2649
01:48:07,250 --> 01:48:11,010
I really don't like your game, Toki.

2650
01:48:11,010 --> 01:48:15,210
It's not for me, it's for my dragoons, okay?

2651
01:48:16,070 --> 01:48:20,590
I'm- I'm just doing what I can to help my dragoons.

2652
01:48:22,950 --> 01:48:25,990
Running up business is very hard, okay?

2653
01:48:30,690 --> 01:48:33,510
I'm just- I have to wake dad up anyway.

2654
01:48:33,910 --> 01:48:35,090
He's gotta wake up.

2655
01:48:35,370 --> 01:48:37,990
I'm just gonna let the stick bug beat him up a little.

2656
01:48:39,110 --> 01:48:43,310
He does so little damage that he's, like, just poking him, and he's not waking up.

2657
01:48:43,730 --> 01:48:45,070
That's not waking up.

2658
01:48:45,250 --> 01:48:46,390
He just- oh, there you go.

2659
01:48:46,990 --> 01:48:47,510
Thank God.

2660
01:48:48,530 --> 01:48:50,510
I'm just a small business owner.

2661
01:48:50,970 --> 01:48:57,210
Trying to- trying so hard to make money for my- my little dragoons.

2662
01:48:58,670 --> 01:49:01,590
Giving my dragoons a safe place, you know?

2663
01:49:01,830 --> 01:49:03,010
A safe space.

2664
01:49:09,710 --> 01:49:12,110
I'm just a small business owner.

2665
01:49:15,170 --> 01:49:16,010
Alright, that's safe.

2666
01:49:16,130 --> 01:49:16,450
Don't worry.

2667
01:49:19,410 --> 01:49:21,990
Am I, like, go- I feel like I'm going the wrong way.

2668
01:49:22,790 --> 01:49:24,330
I'm just gonna see stick bug.

2669
01:49:24,430 --> 01:49:25,310
I have to have a repel.

2670
01:49:25,430 --> 01:49:26,430
I have to have a repel.

2671
01:49:26,530 --> 01:49:27,110
There's no way.

2672
01:49:30,670 --> 01:49:31,090
Okay.

2673
01:49:34,330 --> 01:49:36,090
Uh, where's my pocket?

2674
01:49:37,730 --> 01:49:39,890
Do not have a singular repel?

2675
01:49:40,070 --> 01:49:40,930
I don't.

2676
01:49:44,450 --> 01:49:45,050
Wait.

2677
01:49:47,950 --> 01:49:51,670
Elevates the holder, and if hit, this item will burst.

2678
01:49:52,390 --> 01:49:54,870
Oh, the person will start- Oh!

2679
01:49:55,850 --> 01:49:57,050
Oh, I see.

2680
01:49:57,210 --> 01:49:58,830
Okay, I'm back on con capital.

2681
01:49:59,150 --> 01:50:01,150
Where does the right side go, then?

2682
01:50:02,850 --> 01:50:03,790
Oh, there's a gag.

2683
01:50:04,990 --> 01:50:05,990
Absolutely, thank you to the super chat.

2684
01:50:06,070 --> 01:50:06,630
Thank you, thank you.

2685
01:50:06,690 --> 01:50:08,130
We all float in the goon cave.

2686
01:50:08,290 --> 01:50:09,090
You'll float, too.

2687
01:50:09,470 --> 01:50:10,430
You'll float, too.

2688
01:50:10,730 --> 01:50:11,470
Thank you to the super chat.

2689
01:50:11,570 --> 01:50:12,370
Thank you, thank you.

2690
01:50:13,090 --> 01:50:16,310
I'm glad I conned up here before you challenged Donkey Kong.

2691
01:50:16,990 --> 01:50:20,130
I'm a little gizmo that can help you with understanding the cons.

2692
01:50:20,690 --> 01:50:21,490
Oh, I got a translator.

2693
01:50:21,750 --> 01:50:22,350
Thank God.

2694
01:50:22,590 --> 01:50:22,990
Finally.

2695
01:50:25,110 --> 01:50:29,070
I'm mighty surprised you were able to make your way through the kingdom with only context clues.

2696
01:50:29,510 --> 01:50:30,070
Oh, thank God.

2697
01:50:30,230 --> 01:50:31,370
Definitely don't need Toad anymore.

2698
01:50:31,370 --> 01:50:32,730
What's that now?

2699
01:50:33,250 --> 01:50:35,990
Captain Cold helped to interpret him for you?

2700
01:50:36,510 --> 01:50:38,030
Isn't that Captain Toad amazing?

2701
01:50:38,810 --> 01:50:42,590
Well, the translator is still yours so you can talk to him needing the captain's help.

2702
01:50:46,470 --> 01:50:47,970
Captain who now?

2703
01:50:48,950 --> 01:50:50,770
Say, I have another one for Luigi.

2704
01:50:51,270 --> 01:50:54,530
We won't have to know where he is so I can hand it off.

2705
01:50:55,230 --> 01:50:56,350
Luigi is with Bowser?

2706
01:50:56,350 --> 01:50:58,470
That's true in the air.

2707
01:50:59,010 --> 01:51:00,690
I hope he keeps himself safe.

2708
01:51:01,450 --> 01:51:05,950
I can't help but get a bad feeling about this while Bowser and Luigi's situation.

2709
01:51:06,850 --> 01:51:10,370
I think it's best to just focus on completing Cap Challenge.

2710
01:51:10,810 --> 01:51:14,030
And getting the Power Stars before Luigi.

2711
01:51:14,030 --> 01:51:15,210
He does.

2712
01:51:16,190 --> 01:51:19,510
Princess and I have been planning something for the first person to get all eight.

2713
01:51:19,990 --> 01:51:23,890
Alright, now have Luigi give Bowser his Power Stars.

2714
01:51:24,650 --> 01:51:26,750
Hold on to this translator for now.

2715
01:51:27,050 --> 01:51:28,970
Go get your fifth Power Star.

2716
01:51:29,470 --> 01:51:29,830
Alright.

2717
01:51:30,830 --> 01:51:31,710
Silly Luigi.

2718
01:51:32,450 --> 01:51:33,870
What is he doing?

2719
01:51:34,250 --> 01:51:34,930
Silly silly.

2720
01:51:36,830 --> 01:51:38,270
Alright, time to heal.

2721
01:51:38,270 --> 01:51:39,830
Zara, thank you for the super chat.

2722
01:51:39,970 --> 01:51:40,090
Thank you.

2723
01:51:40,250 --> 01:51:40,490
Thank you.

2724
01:51:40,610 --> 01:51:42,490
Can I volunteer to be added to your...

2725
01:51:42,490 --> 01:51:42,910
No.

2726
01:51:43,790 --> 01:51:45,430
You gotta be chosen.

2727
01:51:46,730 --> 01:51:48,030
Or piss me off.

2728
01:51:52,350 --> 01:51:53,690
Is CrankyCon here?

2729
01:51:56,010 --> 01:51:56,750
Oh, wait.

2730
01:51:56,790 --> 01:51:57,010
Nice.

2731
01:51:57,070 --> 01:51:58,470
I get to watch the comedy show.

2732
01:51:59,150 --> 01:52:01,570
And now the moment you've been all waiting for.

2733
01:52:01,970 --> 01:52:03,470
Put your hands together.

2734
01:52:03,730 --> 01:52:05,810
For me, CrankyCon!

2735
01:52:07,130 --> 01:52:07,810
CrankyCon!

2736
01:52:07,810 --> 01:52:08,230
Woo!

2737
01:52:09,330 --> 01:52:09,950
Yeah!

2738
01:52:10,550 --> 01:52:13,110
Good evening, Con Capital!

2739
01:52:13,610 --> 01:52:15,690
I came out of a tree!

2740
01:52:16,050 --> 01:52:19,570
I love coming back to JAPES every week!

2741
01:52:19,930 --> 01:52:20,650
You guys!

2742
01:52:20,890 --> 01:52:21,810
My crowd!

2743
01:52:22,390 --> 01:52:23,510
My citizens!

2744
01:52:24,190 --> 01:52:25,770
My commucity!

2745
01:52:26,310 --> 01:52:28,570
Makes me happy to be a king!

2746
01:52:29,290 --> 01:52:31,610
I feel like they're forced to watch this.

2747
01:52:31,710 --> 01:52:33,110
Yeah, it's like a punishment or something.

2748
01:52:33,170 --> 01:52:34,030
Because he's the king.

2749
01:52:34,910 --> 01:52:39,190
You know, growing up, I was told I was going to be a poor king.

2750
01:52:39,630 --> 01:52:45,650
My father, the king before me, amazing con, said I wasn't fit to be one.

2751
01:52:45,910 --> 01:52:49,470
He always told me to stop monkeying around!

2752
01:52:50,610 --> 01:52:52,750
I was a piece of work.

2753
01:52:53,210 --> 01:52:54,630
I was such a piece of work.

2754
01:52:54,770 --> 01:52:57,390
You call me monkey business!

2755
01:52:57,390 --> 01:52:58,690
Please clap.

2756
01:52:58,890 --> 01:52:59,990
Please clap, everybody.

2757
01:53:02,190 --> 01:53:03,790
I couldn't stop.

2758
01:53:04,370 --> 01:53:07,810
Honestly, I thought I was better fit as a court jester.

2759
01:53:08,270 --> 01:53:11,650
And today, I'm not helpful not thinking about it.

2760
01:53:11,990 --> 01:53:14,830
This child was destined to be mine since birth.

2761
01:53:15,210 --> 01:53:17,950
My destiny was always predetermined.

2762
01:53:18,590 --> 01:53:20,190
I was so short-sighted to think.

2763
01:53:20,810 --> 01:53:24,630
How is it going to be your court jester every week of my life?

2764
01:53:25,610 --> 01:53:26,170
Cranky!

2765
01:53:26,510 --> 01:53:27,070
Cranky!

2766
01:53:27,430 --> 01:53:27,990
Cranky!

2767
01:53:28,370 --> 01:53:28,930
Cranky!

2768
01:53:29,410 --> 01:53:30,850
This is going to sound shocking.

2769
01:53:31,050 --> 01:53:34,810
But I don't want to be a king growing up.

2770
01:53:35,250 --> 01:53:37,810
I had three things on my mind when I was younger.

2771
01:53:38,150 --> 01:53:39,190
Upgrading my car.

2772
01:53:39,470 --> 01:53:41,350
Which banana I was going to have for dinner.

2773
01:53:41,710 --> 01:53:44,130
And taking off the car of my dreams.

2774
01:53:44,130 --> 01:53:48,270
Thinking you're out of her flummery boyfriend's life!

2775
01:53:50,350 --> 01:53:51,310
Please clap.

2776
01:53:51,670 --> 01:53:52,170
Please clap.

2777
01:53:52,910 --> 01:53:54,470
Hey, and will you know it?

2778
01:53:54,790 --> 01:53:56,410
Mario is here in my show!

2779
01:53:57,070 --> 01:54:01,050
Truth be told, I once wanted to take Mario out.

2780
01:54:01,250 --> 01:54:04,490
But I'm out of my life with arrows!

2781
01:54:05,730 --> 01:54:09,870
Let's give Mario a round of applause for being a great sport.

2782
01:54:10,270 --> 01:54:12,430
On occasion, he'll help us out.

2783
01:54:12,430 --> 01:54:15,230
But only when it's for his very special princess.

2784
01:54:15,970 --> 01:54:18,070
He's got it all figured out.

2785
01:54:18,570 --> 01:54:20,870
Oh, to think my life was all figured out.

2786
01:54:21,110 --> 01:54:26,110
Just by looking at the crowd, I can see most of you are in the process of figuring it out.

2787
01:54:26,470 --> 01:54:28,210
I see you in the front.

2788
01:54:28,430 --> 01:54:30,110
A banana martini in one hand.

2789
01:54:30,510 --> 01:54:31,830
You're a sweetie in the other.

2790
01:54:32,270 --> 01:54:38,530
And I can only assume you're jungling to pay off your card payments!

2791
01:54:38,970 --> 01:54:39,330
Ha ha!

2792
01:54:39,710 --> 01:54:40,650
Let me guess.

2793
01:54:40,650 --> 01:54:42,870
Loan from the casino kingdom?

2794
01:54:43,210 --> 01:54:43,630
Ha ha!

2795
01:54:43,950 --> 01:54:46,190
I see that guilty face!

2796
01:54:46,410 --> 01:54:49,290
You're probably also the type to do some gabbling here and there!

2797
01:54:49,670 --> 01:54:51,430
That's nothing to be ashamed of.

2798
01:54:51,710 --> 01:54:53,850
We all played a table of cards before.

2799
01:54:54,230 --> 01:54:55,730
Oh my god, how does he know?

2800
01:54:57,010 --> 01:55:02,270
If it was up to me, we'd be called Chip Pansies!

2801
01:55:02,850 --> 01:55:03,590
Ha ha ha!

2802
01:55:07,010 --> 01:55:10,130
God, I'm laughing my fucking ass off!

2803
01:55:10,870 --> 01:55:17,030
Well then, it looks like I've warmed you up for all my next two hours of my show!

2804
01:55:17,850 --> 01:55:18,470
Cranky!

2805
01:55:18,970 --> 01:55:19,590
Cranky!

2806
01:55:20,110 --> 01:55:20,730
Cranky!

2807
01:55:21,690 --> 01:55:25,950
Three hours of fantastic monkey jokes later.

2808
01:55:26,550 --> 01:55:27,210
Mario!

2809
01:55:29,230 --> 01:55:31,750
It says, Cranky's Comedy Hour.

2810
01:55:32,050 --> 01:55:34,890
When did it become Cranky's Comedy Hours?

2811
01:55:35,610 --> 01:55:37,850
Thank you again for coming to my show.

2812
01:55:38,630 --> 01:55:42,670
Thanks a lot for me to write all my material and perform in front of everyone.

2813
01:55:42,930 --> 01:55:43,130
Ha!

2814
01:55:43,130 --> 01:55:46,810
Not because I'm so talented and a king.

2815
01:55:47,210 --> 01:55:48,470
Oh, this comes natural.

2816
01:55:48,870 --> 01:55:49,550
Is that wild?

2817
01:55:50,090 --> 01:55:52,610
Just like wild battles!

2818
01:55:53,710 --> 01:55:54,130
Ha ha!

2819
01:55:54,730 --> 01:55:57,010
I told you it comes natural.

2820
01:55:57,330 --> 01:55:59,790
It was the texture to our free.

2821
01:56:00,150 --> 01:56:00,790
Encore!

2822
01:56:01,050 --> 01:56:01,590
Encore!

2823
01:56:02,170 --> 01:56:04,090
Here's a little something for you.

2824
01:56:04,430 --> 01:56:05,310
Oh, I got a TM.

2825
01:56:05,610 --> 01:56:05,850
Nice.

2826
01:56:06,490 --> 01:56:11,190
Oh, I can't wait to be king so I can make you guys stay here for three hours.

2827
01:56:11,330 --> 01:56:13,010
More Dynasty Warriors.

2828
01:56:13,710 --> 01:56:15,030
Ha ha ha ha!

2829
01:56:15,510 --> 01:56:16,550
Respecting that flower?

2830
01:56:17,050 --> 01:56:20,530
If that's your wish, you're gonna have to take it from my monkey's paw!

2831
01:56:20,910 --> 01:56:22,210
Oh, I am good!

2832
01:56:22,910 --> 01:56:23,970
Come back anytime.

2833
01:56:24,510 --> 01:56:26,850
I perform literally every day.

2834
01:56:29,130 --> 01:56:29,930
All right.

2835
01:56:31,150 --> 01:56:32,650
Steven, thank you for the super chat.

2836
01:56:32,790 --> 01:56:33,450
Thank you.

2837
01:56:33,450 --> 01:56:33,830
Thank you.

2838
01:56:34,230 --> 01:56:37,590
I can't believe what the dragoons are doing.

2839
01:56:37,590 --> 01:56:42,650
Anyways, on an unrelated note, as Lurker, I also like to be in that box.

2840
01:56:42,650 --> 01:56:44,150
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

2841
01:56:44,590 --> 01:56:47,050
You can never escape the box.

2842
01:56:47,490 --> 01:56:48,390
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

2843
01:56:49,150 --> 01:56:50,470
See, I told you.

2844
01:56:50,990 --> 01:56:53,190
Everyone wants to be in that box.

2845
01:56:53,310 --> 01:56:54,690
Don't listen to the rumors.

2846
01:56:55,350 --> 01:56:55,710
Don't...

2847
01:56:55,710 --> 01:56:57,090
Ha ha ha ha ha!

2848
01:56:59,190 --> 01:57:00,850
Don't listen to the rumors!

2849
01:57:01,270 --> 01:57:02,610
Everyone's satisfied!

2850
01:57:05,690 --> 01:57:06,410
Don't listen to the rumors!

2851
01:57:06,410 --> 01:57:06,830
Oh, my God!

2852
01:57:07,510 --> 01:57:08,050
I...

2853
01:57:08,050 --> 01:57:09,170
We need another.

2854
01:57:10,050 --> 01:57:12,130
Steven, today's your lucky day.

2855
01:57:12,630 --> 01:57:13,890
Ha ha ha ha ha!

2856
01:57:15,010 --> 01:57:16,430
Ha ha ha ha!

2857
01:57:17,430 --> 01:57:18,410
Don't listen!

2858
01:57:18,710 --> 01:57:20,690
There's no whistleblower here!

2859
01:57:21,190 --> 01:57:22,570
They're all liars!

2860
01:57:23,070 --> 01:57:23,850
Ha ha ha ha!

2861
01:57:25,010 --> 01:57:27,010
Steven, today's your lucky day!

2862
01:57:29,310 --> 01:57:30,270
Don't worry!

2863
01:57:30,270 --> 01:57:30,310
Don't worry!

2864
01:57:31,090 --> 01:57:32,030
Be happy!

2865
01:57:33,550 --> 01:57:34,890
Who is it that...

2866
01:57:35,430 --> 01:57:36,790
Oh, there you go.

2867
01:57:37,770 --> 01:57:39,450
My shared custody goon.

2868
01:57:43,130 --> 01:57:44,450
Oh, my gosh!

2869
01:57:44,510 --> 01:57:46,430
She has, like, her own special song, too.

2870
01:57:48,970 --> 01:57:49,750
All right.

2871
01:57:49,910 --> 01:57:50,410
Sing!

2872
01:57:51,490 --> 01:57:52,510
You missed?

2873
01:57:52,970 --> 01:57:55,170
If you miss again, I'm putting you back in the box.

2874
01:57:55,710 --> 01:57:55,890
All right.

2875
01:57:56,150 --> 01:57:57,150
Ha ha ha ha!

2876
01:58:00,030 --> 01:58:01,110
I need this!

2877
01:58:01,250 --> 01:58:02,410
I need this, goon!

2878
01:58:02,590 --> 01:58:02,990
Oh!

2879
01:58:04,890 --> 01:58:05,750
It's time!

2880
01:58:06,430 --> 01:58:07,250
Ha ha ha ha!

2881
01:58:14,630 --> 01:58:17,730
I gave you one chance.

2882
01:58:19,210 --> 01:58:23,550
I gave you one chance to redeem yourself.

2883
01:58:23,870 --> 01:58:25,850
Ha ha ha ha ha!

2884
01:58:30,090 --> 01:58:30,850
All right.

2885
01:58:33,250 --> 01:58:35,370
They couldn't resist.

2886
01:58:35,770 --> 01:58:36,410
All right.

2887
01:58:36,410 --> 01:58:38,130
I'll give you one more chance.

2888
01:58:38,410 --> 01:58:39,250
I feel...

2889
01:58:40,990 --> 01:58:43,170
Today, I feel a little kind.

2890
01:58:43,710 --> 01:58:43,830
Oh, wait.

2891
01:58:43,930 --> 01:58:45,730
Actually, there's no way you'll kill him.

2892
01:58:46,290 --> 01:58:47,190
There's no way.

2893
01:58:48,450 --> 01:58:49,410
There's no way.

2894
01:58:50,430 --> 01:58:51,230
Okay, nice.

2895
01:58:51,310 --> 01:58:51,890
You didn't kill him.

2896
01:58:52,010 --> 01:58:53,670
Are you fucking kidding me?

2897
01:58:53,790 --> 01:58:54,350
And he wins!

2898
01:58:54,470 --> 01:58:55,890
Okay, you're going back to the box.

2899
01:58:57,010 --> 01:58:58,690
Ha ha ha ha ha!

2900
01:59:02,890 --> 01:59:05,650
I thought I could rely on you.

2901
01:59:06,410 --> 01:59:08,630
But clearly, I was wrong.

2902
01:59:09,350 --> 01:59:10,990
Ha ha ha ha ha!

2903
01:59:13,550 --> 01:59:15,250
Clearly, I was wrong.

2904
01:59:16,450 --> 01:59:18,470
Back to the box, you go!

2905
01:59:22,350 --> 01:59:28,650
My old reliable dragoon who decided to get confused and hit yourself.

2906
01:59:30,950 --> 01:59:38,170
The power of two dragoons, and you still couldn't hit one sleep.

2907
01:59:41,880 --> 01:59:42,860
All right.

2908
01:59:42,980 --> 01:59:44,500
I'll give that goon...

2909
01:59:44,500 --> 01:59:47,800
I'll give those goons one more chance.

2910
01:59:48,300 --> 01:59:50,100
One more chance!

2911
01:59:50,680 --> 01:59:52,980
And then, after that, it's over.

2912
01:59:53,400 --> 01:59:54,980
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

2913
01:59:59,300 --> 02:00:00,280
Last chance!

2914
02:00:05,560 --> 02:00:06,400
Oh, nice!

2915
02:00:06,580 --> 02:00:07,220
Oh, that was fast!

2916
02:00:07,400 --> 02:00:07,820
What the fuck?

2917
02:00:08,040 --> 02:00:09,000
That was critical catch!

2918
02:00:09,960 --> 02:00:10,500
All right.

2919
02:00:13,660 --> 02:00:14,180
Nice!

2920
02:00:14,480 --> 02:00:15,060
All right, Steven.

2921
02:00:16,040 --> 02:00:16,560
Congratulations!

2922
02:00:23,530 --> 02:00:24,250
Steven.

2923
02:00:25,270 --> 02:00:25,990
Steven.

2924
02:00:26,650 --> 02:00:26,870
Finn.

2925
02:00:27,130 --> 02:00:27,250
Oops.

2926
02:00:27,870 --> 02:00:28,230
Finn.

2927
02:00:31,090 --> 02:00:31,810
Moon.

2928
02:00:32,930 --> 02:00:33,290
Nice!

2929
02:00:33,810 --> 02:00:34,230
Just fit.

2930
02:00:34,570 --> 02:00:34,870
Oh, wait!

2931
02:00:35,170 --> 02:00:35,650
Never mind.

2932
02:00:36,350 --> 02:00:37,370
St- Ha ha ha ha!

2933
02:00:37,370 --> 02:00:38,970
I spelled Steven wrong.

2934
02:00:39,690 --> 02:00:39,850
Uh!

2935
02:00:41,850 --> 02:00:42,570
Steve...

2936
02:00:42,570 --> 02:00:44,230
E-N...

2937
02:00:44,230 --> 02:00:45,150
Wait, it doesn't...

2938
02:00:45,150 --> 02:00:45,430
Okay.

2939
02:00:47,830 --> 02:00:48,550
Steve.

2940
02:00:49,050 --> 02:00:49,510
Okay.

2941
02:00:50,910 --> 02:00:53,310
Sorry, but you are going to be called Q-goon.

2942
02:00:53,670 --> 02:00:54,730
Because it doesn't work.

2943
02:00:59,110 --> 02:00:59,830
Q-goon.

2944
02:01:00,750 --> 02:01:01,450
There you go.

2945
02:01:02,290 --> 02:01:03,950
Meep, thank you for the time to get the chest.

2946
02:01:04,150 --> 02:01:05,050
Thank you.

2947
02:01:09,210 --> 02:01:09,970
Oh, there you go.

2948
02:01:10,030 --> 02:01:12,090
Oh, you went to the goon cave yourself.

2949
02:01:12,450 --> 02:01:13,570
You knew where you were...

2950
02:01:17,630 --> 02:01:20,330
You knew where to go.

2951
02:01:20,510 --> 02:01:21,150
That's good to know.

2952
02:01:24,330 --> 02:01:25,710
Oh, thank you for the super chat.

2953
02:01:25,830 --> 02:01:26,070
Thank you.

2954
02:01:26,210 --> 02:01:26,810
Thank you.

2955
02:01:27,270 --> 02:01:27,710
Please.

2956
02:01:27,970 --> 02:01:30,470
Stuck me in the lockers.

2957
02:01:30,650 --> 02:01:32,090
It will make the straggler.

2958
02:01:32,910 --> 02:01:34,730
Solid Snake, thank you for the super chat.

2959
02:01:34,830 --> 02:01:35,090
Thank you.

2960
02:01:35,230 --> 02:01:35,710
Thank you.

2961
02:01:36,310 --> 02:01:37,370
It's true, I like boxes.

2962
02:01:37,570 --> 02:01:39,930
But maybe because it's in my jeans.

2963
02:01:41,890 --> 02:01:42,330
Greetings.

2964
02:01:42,890 --> 02:01:44,890
You must be Mario, no?

2965
02:01:45,770 --> 02:01:48,750
Are you ready to face Donkey Kong in the wild battle?

2966
02:01:48,750 --> 02:01:49,710
Yes.

2967
02:01:50,150 --> 02:01:50,810
Very well.

2968
02:01:51,130 --> 02:01:52,310
Please follow me.

2969
02:01:54,990 --> 02:01:56,170
Here we are.

2970
02:01:56,570 --> 02:01:57,510
Good luck, Mario.

2971
02:01:59,050 --> 02:02:02,330
Mario, what a surprise to see you swing by.

2972
02:02:02,330 --> 02:02:03,210
Haha.

2973
02:02:04,410 --> 02:02:07,610
Not like swinging out vines and tree branches.

2974
02:02:07,950 --> 02:02:08,510
Haha, you know?

2975
02:02:09,230 --> 02:02:09,750
You're right.

2976
02:02:10,170 --> 02:02:13,230
I'm just trying to be you cheeky.

2977
02:02:13,570 --> 02:02:13,930
Hahaha.

2978
02:02:15,190 --> 02:02:15,630
Please clap.

2979
02:02:16,690 --> 02:02:18,110
I knew you were all going to love that.

2980
02:02:18,110 --> 02:02:19,390
I had that plan for a while.

2981
02:02:19,890 --> 02:02:21,270
And using it with beta switch.

2982
02:02:21,350 --> 02:02:22,290
That's great.

2983
02:02:22,730 --> 02:02:23,450
I'm hilarious.

2984
02:02:24,210 --> 02:02:26,070
Here, have a flyer.

2985
02:02:26,570 --> 02:02:29,210
Catch me on my YouTube channel at Donkey Bird.

2986
02:02:31,210 --> 02:02:33,770
Donkey Kong gives you another flyer for his comedy night.

2987
02:02:34,610 --> 02:02:35,070
Anyway.

2988
02:02:38,370 --> 02:02:38,950
Ahem.

2989
02:02:39,370 --> 02:02:40,730
He's the leader of the bunch.

2990
02:02:40,970 --> 02:02:41,830
You know him well.

2991
02:02:41,830 --> 02:02:43,930
DK, DK.

2992
02:02:45,790 --> 02:02:46,670
DK.

2993
02:02:46,670 --> 02:02:46,730
DK.

2994
02:02:46,730 --> 02:02:46,890
DK.

2995
02:02:46,890 --> 02:02:47,670
Donkey Kong.

2996
02:02:50,630 --> 02:02:52,050
How does it go?

2997
02:02:52,190 --> 02:02:53,010
How does that laugh go?

2998
02:02:54,810 --> 02:02:55,410
Hahaha.

2999
02:02:57,550 --> 02:02:57,930
Hahaha.

3000
02:03:02,230 --> 02:03:02,670
No.

3001
02:03:03,670 --> 02:03:04,250
Hahaha.

3002
02:03:08,470 --> 02:03:09,910
Cheeks out.

3003
02:03:10,290 --> 02:03:11,810
DK starts flexing.

3004
02:03:11,810 --> 02:03:14,470
It expects which one.

3005
02:03:14,470 --> 02:03:15,210
Hahaha.

3006
02:03:16,530 --> 02:03:16,850
Wait.

3007
02:03:17,490 --> 02:03:19,230
What the cap is the banana?

3008
02:03:19,850 --> 02:03:20,670
Oh my god.

3009
02:03:24,110 --> 02:03:26,170
I think they're like grass-fed.

3010
02:03:27,770 --> 02:03:29,050
Are you serious?

3011
02:03:30,130 --> 02:03:31,990
I'm still gonna slash you.

3012
02:03:32,470 --> 02:03:34,090
He knows what he has.

3013
02:03:34,970 --> 02:03:35,630
Hahaha.

3014
02:03:37,910 --> 02:03:39,610
He's a little cheeky.

3015
02:03:39,870 --> 02:03:40,490
Look.

3016
02:03:40,490 --> 02:03:41,470
If he's got it.

3017
02:03:41,550 --> 02:03:42,590
He's gotta flex it.

3018
02:03:42,710 --> 02:03:42,950
You know.

3019
02:03:42,970 --> 02:03:44,030
Can't hide it.

3020
02:03:45,170 --> 02:03:46,710
Shouldn't hide what he's got.

3021
02:03:50,270 --> 02:03:50,890
Ooh.

3022
02:03:51,270 --> 02:03:51,670
Ooh.

3023
02:03:51,950 --> 02:03:53,190
I have a translator.

3024
02:03:53,450 --> 02:03:55,610
You're not even speaking proper monkey?

3025
02:03:56,390 --> 02:03:57,010
Hahaha.

3026
02:03:58,650 --> 02:03:59,830
Did they drop this?

3027
02:04:00,130 --> 02:04:02,690
Did they drop Donkey Kong from a tree?

3028
02:04:06,150 --> 02:04:09,630
It's like my translator's not even picking up anything.

3029
02:04:10,450 --> 02:04:11,070
Hahaha.

3030
02:04:13,090 --> 02:04:15,520
I don't understand.

3031
02:04:20,090 --> 02:04:23,290
Don't make fun of his accent.

3032
02:04:23,550 --> 02:04:26,190
He speaks his own language.

3033
02:04:28,110 --> 02:04:29,690
Bro, just.

3034
02:04:30,290 --> 02:04:30,930
Bro.

3035
02:04:31,690 --> 02:04:35,430
His accent is too sick for the translator.

3036
02:04:38,510 --> 02:04:40,110
Help me add in to protect.

3037
02:04:45,510 --> 02:04:45,870
Alright.

3038
02:04:47,470 --> 02:04:48,090
Oh, nice.

3039
02:04:48,270 --> 02:04:49,950
Oh, I'm glad they're all like, grass.

3040
02:04:50,270 --> 02:04:50,650
I'm still.

3041
02:04:50,790 --> 02:04:51,110
I'm gonna.

3042
02:04:51,330 --> 02:04:52,790
I'm gonna sit on that spike.

3043
02:04:53,430 --> 02:04:53,790
Hahaha.

3044
02:04:55,250 --> 02:04:55,970
Actually, I'm not sure.

3045
02:04:56,150 --> 02:04:56,650
But like, okay.

3046
02:04:56,810 --> 02:04:57,430
I knew he was gonna use.

3047
02:04:57,610 --> 02:04:59,630
Dude, did they all have protect or some shit?

3048
02:05:01,850 --> 02:05:02,890
Poor dad.

3049
02:05:05,950 --> 02:05:06,690
Crush.

3050
02:05:08,990 --> 02:05:09,730
Nice.

3051
02:05:10,110 --> 02:05:10,850
Poor dad.

3052
02:05:11,270 --> 02:05:11,670
Nice.

3053
02:05:16,790 --> 02:05:17,150
Alright.

3054
02:05:17,510 --> 02:05:18,050
What is it?

3055
02:05:18,130 --> 02:05:19,030
Oh, it's the wiggler.

3056
02:05:20,330 --> 02:05:22,210
DK pounds his chest.

3057
02:05:23,750 --> 02:05:24,290
Okay.

3058
02:05:24,370 --> 02:05:25,310
Let's get rid of Trunkle.

3059
02:05:28,230 --> 02:05:28,870
Wait.

3060
02:05:28,950 --> 02:05:29,670
What did he use?

3061
02:05:31,330 --> 02:05:33,210
What does the Coba Berry do?

3062
02:05:37,260 --> 02:05:37,960
We can.

3063
02:05:38,100 --> 02:05:38,300
We can.

3064
02:05:38,300 --> 02:05:39,000
Oh, it weakened.

3065
02:05:39,200 --> 02:05:39,380
Okay.

3066
02:05:39,500 --> 02:05:39,900
That's good.

3067
02:05:40,760 --> 02:05:41,260
Crush.

3068
02:05:44,740 --> 02:05:45,240
Yeah.

3069
02:05:45,320 --> 02:05:46,880
I figured he'd be fighting too.

3070
02:05:47,180 --> 02:05:47,860
Instead of grass.

3071
02:05:51,300 --> 02:05:51,800
Alright.

3072
02:05:51,840 --> 02:05:52,140
Nice.

3073
02:05:52,380 --> 02:05:52,780
We have.

3074
02:05:52,960 --> 02:05:53,680
I think that's the last.

3075
02:05:53,820 --> 02:05:54,680
Last one, right?

3076
02:05:55,040 --> 02:05:55,380
Yeah.

3077
02:05:55,400 --> 02:05:56,060
That's the last one.

3078
02:06:00,940 --> 02:06:02,040
Goodbye, wiggler.

3079
02:06:02,840 --> 02:06:03,200
Bye!

3080
02:06:04,640 --> 02:06:05,420
That's right.

3081
02:06:06,220 --> 02:06:07,640
I'm not letting you change.

3082
02:06:09,240 --> 02:06:09,920
Yay!

3083
02:06:10,540 --> 02:06:11,220
Okay, I have to do.

3084
02:06:11,340 --> 02:06:12,020
What is this?

3085
02:06:12,760 --> 02:06:13,940
Not a hitting move?

3086
02:06:14,140 --> 02:06:15,060
Get out of here.

3087
02:06:15,360 --> 02:06:17,020
I only do damage.

3088
02:06:20,870 --> 02:06:21,390
Ooh.

3089
02:06:25,750 --> 02:06:26,430
DK!

3090
02:06:27,350 --> 02:06:29,090
Donkey Kong has lost!

3091
02:06:30,070 --> 02:06:30,510
Now.

3092
02:06:31,870 --> 02:06:32,990
Donkey Kong.

3093
02:06:33,270 --> 02:06:36,450
What did I tell you about throwing yourself into battle?

3094
02:06:37,310 --> 02:06:38,330
That's right.

3095
02:06:39,230 --> 02:06:41,590
Only losers do that.

3096
02:06:42,730 --> 02:06:42,850
Well.

3097
02:06:43,270 --> 02:06:45,470
As much as I hate to admit it.

3098
02:06:46,110 --> 02:06:46,910
Donkey Kong.

3099
02:06:47,150 --> 02:06:48,130
And by extension.

3100
02:06:48,570 --> 02:06:49,350
The Kongs.

3101
02:06:49,910 --> 02:06:51,710
Have lost above the Mario butters.

3102
02:06:51,850 --> 02:06:53,330
Luigi won?!

3103
02:06:54,970 --> 02:06:56,410
How did he win?!

3104
02:06:57,170 --> 02:07:00,170
I thought Donkey Kong was beating his shit out of him!

3105
02:07:00,310 --> 02:07:01,390
With his hands!

3106
02:07:02,710 --> 02:07:05,030
I believe this belongs to you.

3107
02:07:05,410 --> 02:07:06,130
How did...

3108
02:07:06,130 --> 02:07:07,370
Did he...

3109
02:07:07,370 --> 02:07:11,570
Did he just like beat him up after he won?!

3110
02:07:14,050 --> 02:07:16,770
The year of the Luigi never ends.

3111
02:07:16,990 --> 02:07:20,790
What if like Luigi won the battle and then Donkey Kong was like...

3112
02:07:21,110 --> 02:07:22,770
And then he just punched him.

3113
02:07:22,770 --> 02:07:24,330
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

3114
02:07:27,690 --> 02:07:29,990
That seems like a Donkey Kong thing to do.

3115
02:07:33,700 --> 02:07:36,200
Oh I also have something from your toad friend.

3116
02:07:36,500 --> 02:07:38,980
Tell me to give it to you once you've got your Pyre star...

3117
02:07:38,980 --> 02:07:39,620
Oh I got the Pyre star?

3118
02:07:39,720 --> 02:07:40,440
Thank fucking God.

3119
02:07:40,660 --> 02:07:42,080
He sure gave it to me in the first place.

3120
02:07:42,740 --> 02:07:43,960
And don't forget this.

3121
02:07:46,040 --> 02:07:48,720
The Luigi is back, guys!

3122
02:07:48,980 --> 02:07:50,940
For the Nintendo Switch 2!

3123
02:07:52,160 --> 02:07:54,640
The Power Gloves should let you move boaters of ease.

3124
02:07:54,980 --> 02:07:56,520
Wait, that gives me an idea.

3125
02:07:57,160 --> 02:07:59,820
What do you got, Pumler, struggling to clog toilet?

3126
02:08:02,620 --> 02:08:03,940
Heavy duty!

3127
02:08:06,280 --> 02:08:09,660
Come by Jay Apes to see my show!

3128
02:08:10,160 --> 02:08:10,640
Ooh!

3129
02:08:12,760 --> 02:08:13,520
Okay, nice.

3130
02:08:13,660 --> 02:08:14,160
I did it.

3131
02:08:14,780 --> 02:08:16,260
Or I can just go back to the warp pipe.

3132
02:08:24,600 --> 02:08:25,320
Nailed it.

3133
02:08:30,760 --> 02:08:32,840
Yes, heal my mons.

3134
02:08:33,680 --> 02:08:35,600
At least like... Well, of course they're laughing!

3135
02:08:35,600 --> 02:08:36,700
He's literally the king!

3136
02:08:36,940 --> 02:08:39,280
If they don't laugh, he'll fucking execute them.

3137
02:08:41,080 --> 02:08:44,520
There's enough... There's enough cons to replace them.

3138
02:08:47,260 --> 02:08:47,900
Alright.

3139
02:08:48,940 --> 02:08:52,880
Before you go, I should let you know that a warp pipe isn't working properly.

3140
02:08:53,380 --> 02:08:58,200
Instead of going to the Metro Kingdom, it's currently going to the Sand Kingdom!

3141
02:08:59,460 --> 02:09:02,340
I have some other plumbers coming over to fix it!

3142
02:09:02,640 --> 02:09:05,540
Because today I know you're busy in the cap challenge!

3143
02:09:06,620 --> 02:09:11,100
You can still get to the Metro Kingdom by passing through the Sand Kingdom!

3144
02:09:11,360 --> 02:09:13,340
But you have to cross the desert first!

3145
02:09:13,780 --> 02:09:14,500
Good luck!

3146
02:09:14,500 --> 02:09:15,480
Oh no!

3147
02:09:16,140 --> 02:09:17,240
Wait, what?

3148
02:09:18,040 --> 02:09:19,860
Why is it a Team Rocket soundtrack there?

3149
02:09:20,360 --> 02:09:22,640
Use the plumber that's been giving the boss...

3150
02:09:22,640 --> 02:09:24,780
I forgot to spend my money!

3151
02:09:25,660 --> 02:09:27,420
It's time to pay up!

3152
02:09:27,420 --> 02:09:28,040
Yeah!

3153
02:09:28,760 --> 02:09:30,260
A thousand purple coins!

3154
02:09:30,520 --> 02:09:30,940
Or...

3155
02:09:30,940 --> 02:09:32,380
We'll take that gold!

3156
02:09:32,740 --> 02:09:33,020
Take...

3157
02:09:33,020 --> 02:09:33,260
No!

3158
02:09:34,090 --> 02:09:34,900
I'm sorry!

3159
02:09:35,200 --> 02:09:35,540
Please!

3160
02:09:35,860 --> 02:09:37,020
Don't break my knees!

3161
02:09:37,360 --> 02:09:38,600
I'm so sorry!

3162
02:09:40,160 --> 02:09:40,640
No!

3163
02:09:41,520 --> 02:09:43,920
Then it seems we're going to have to do this the hard way!

3164
02:09:44,040 --> 02:09:44,340
Oh!

3165
02:09:44,380 --> 02:09:45,400
I could just battle them?

3166
02:09:45,540 --> 02:09:45,680
Oh!

3167
02:09:45,700 --> 02:09:46,300
That's easy!

3168
02:09:48,800 --> 02:09:49,280
That...

3169
02:09:49,280 --> 02:09:50,780
That should be easy, right?

3170
02:09:51,040 --> 02:09:51,440
Oh!

3171
02:09:51,540 --> 02:09:51,740
Wait!

3172
02:09:51,820 --> 02:09:52,560
What the fuck?

3173
02:09:52,780 --> 02:09:55,140
Why did you guys tell me I could just fight them?

3174
02:09:56,060 --> 02:09:56,540
Wait!

3175
02:09:56,920 --> 02:09:58,220
I was scared!

3176
02:09:58,620 --> 02:09:59,120
Oh wait!

3177
02:09:59,140 --> 02:09:59,920
That guy's water!

3178
02:10:01,040 --> 02:10:01,520
Wait!

3179
02:10:01,520 --> 02:10:03,520
Why was I scared for?

3180
02:10:03,520 --> 02:10:03,640
What?

3181
02:10:04,080 --> 02:10:04,680
Hahaha!

3182
02:10:07,920 --> 02:10:08,800
That's right!

3183
02:10:12,400 --> 02:10:14,920
They're level 33?!

3184
02:10:14,920 --> 02:10:15,200
Bah!

3185
02:10:15,940 --> 02:10:16,760
That's right!

3186
02:10:16,920 --> 02:10:18,000
What you gonna do now?

3187
02:10:18,500 --> 02:10:19,100
Okay!

3188
02:10:19,120 --> 02:10:21,000
I was expecting to have like...

3189
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:23,260
A mon that was like level 99 or something!

3190
02:10:23,740 --> 02:10:24,400
That's right!

3191
02:10:24,520 --> 02:10:26,100
I'll rob the mafia then!

3192
02:10:26,860 --> 02:10:27,160
Wait!

3193
02:10:27,220 --> 02:10:27,760
What the fuck?

3194
02:10:27,940 --> 02:10:28,420
Oh shit!

3195
02:10:30,160 --> 02:10:31,080
Oh shit!

3196
02:10:31,700 --> 02:10:32,300
Don't...

3197
02:10:33,520 --> 02:10:33,880
Oh my god!

3198
02:10:33,940 --> 02:10:35,140
All of them are like...

3199
02:10:35,500 --> 02:10:35,840
What?

3200
02:10:36,960 --> 02:10:39,300
Don't deny that a good time!

3201
02:10:42,300 --> 02:10:42,740
Damn!

3202
02:10:42,880 --> 02:10:43,320
I know!

3203
02:10:43,460 --> 02:10:44,360
They're like loan sharks!

3204
02:10:44,460 --> 02:10:45,520
They're from the mafia!

3205
02:10:45,800 --> 02:10:48,180
You expect them to buy better mons!

3206
02:10:49,860 --> 02:10:50,300
Yeah!

3207
02:10:50,360 --> 02:10:51,740
They should have made them like level 99!

3208
02:10:52,080 --> 02:10:53,100
I can't believe I was scared!

3209
02:10:53,320 --> 02:10:56,020
I can't believe I started spending my own money!

3210
02:10:59,990 --> 02:11:00,430
Alright!

3211
02:11:00,610 --> 02:11:00,850
Nice!

3212
02:11:01,390 --> 02:11:03,310
My sick bug grew another level!

3213
02:11:03,870 --> 02:11:04,370
No!

3214
02:11:04,470 --> 02:11:04,990
No detect!

3215
02:11:09,300 --> 02:11:10,280
It's strolling!

3216
02:11:12,420 --> 02:11:12,920
Alright!

3217
02:11:13,060 --> 02:11:13,660
I'll just keep...

3218
02:11:13,660 --> 02:11:15,480
I'll just keep like...

3219
02:11:16,560 --> 02:11:17,060
Actually...

3220
02:11:17,060 --> 02:11:18,020
Is rock...

3221
02:11:18,020 --> 02:11:18,280
No!

3222
02:11:18,400 --> 02:11:19,380
Rock doesn't do well!

3223
02:11:19,520 --> 02:11:20,840
I'll just use magnet bomb!

3224
02:11:20,980 --> 02:11:21,240
Ah!

3225
02:11:21,420 --> 02:11:22,000
I'll just fly!

3226
02:11:22,200 --> 02:11:22,600
Fuck it!

3227
02:11:24,080 --> 02:11:24,880
Just fly up!

3228
02:11:25,220 --> 02:11:25,920
Don't get hurt!

3229
02:11:28,640 --> 02:11:29,760
Don't get hit!

3230
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:30,300
Hefty!

3231
02:11:30,520 --> 02:11:32,160
It's just one simple goal!

3232
02:11:32,580 --> 02:11:33,680
Don't get hit!

3233
02:11:40,640 --> 02:11:41,280
Yeah!

3234
02:11:41,360 --> 02:11:42,880
The casino is selling mons!

3235
02:11:43,040 --> 02:11:44,200
That's what I was thinking too!

3236
02:11:44,800 --> 02:11:46,220
You think like they...

3237
02:11:46,760 --> 02:11:48,100
They'd have better mons!

3238
02:11:48,240 --> 02:11:48,940
They literally...

3239
02:11:48,940 --> 02:11:50,300
They're literally selling them!

3240
02:11:54,090 --> 02:11:54,730
Yay!

3241
02:11:55,450 --> 02:11:58,170
The boss ain't gonna like this!

3242
02:11:58,950 --> 02:11:59,690
That's right!

3243
02:11:59,810 --> 02:12:00,970
You give me money!

3244
02:12:01,290 --> 02:12:02,090
That's right!

3245
02:12:02,510 --> 02:12:02,770
What?

3246
02:12:02,850 --> 02:12:03,890
I get a thousand?

3247
02:12:04,230 --> 02:12:04,650
What the...

3248
02:12:04,650 --> 02:12:07,010
You try to steal ten thousand from me?

3249
02:12:07,170 --> 02:12:09,030
And all I get is a thousand?

3250
02:12:09,990 --> 02:12:10,510
Oh!

3251
02:12:10,830 --> 02:12:11,790
What do we do now?

3252
02:12:12,050 --> 02:12:12,570
You idiot!

3253
02:12:12,870 --> 02:12:13,630
You don't!

3254
02:12:13,710 --> 02:12:14,430
We bail!

3255
02:12:14,750 --> 02:12:16,170
Never tell the boss any of this!

3256
02:12:16,590 --> 02:12:17,190
That's right!

3257
02:12:17,410 --> 02:12:17,830
Run!

3258
02:12:18,510 --> 02:12:19,010
Run!

3259
02:12:19,650 --> 02:12:20,370
It's a me!

3260
02:12:20,590 --> 02:12:20,970
Mario!

3261
02:12:25,270 --> 02:12:26,150
Oh shit!

3262
02:12:28,150 --> 02:12:28,670
Wait!

3263
02:12:28,910 --> 02:12:29,230
It's what?

3264
02:12:29,390 --> 02:12:29,510
Wait!

3265
02:12:29,590 --> 02:12:30,590
Are they plumbers now?

3266
02:12:32,630 --> 02:12:34,030
Where's the leak, ma'am?

3267
02:12:37,030 --> 02:12:37,810
Oh hey!

3268
02:12:37,910 --> 02:12:38,570
There they are!

3269
02:12:39,870 --> 02:12:41,070
The Cockaracha!

3270
02:12:41,330 --> 02:12:42,070
What is it called?

3271
02:12:43,070 --> 02:12:43,370
Ah!

3272
02:12:47,310 --> 02:12:47,910
Oh!

3273
02:12:47,910 --> 02:12:48,610
I got saucy sand.

3274
02:12:49,310 --> 02:12:50,410
The cockroach song!

3275
02:12:51,550 --> 02:12:52,210
The cooca...

3276
02:12:52,210 --> 02:12:52,530
Oh!

3277
02:12:52,690 --> 02:12:53,870
The cooca...

3278
02:12:53,870 --> 02:12:53,990
The cooca...

3279
02:12:53,990 --> 02:12:54,810
The cooca...

3280
02:12:59,170 --> 02:13:00,370
The cooca...

3281
02:13:00,370 --> 02:13:04,310
I love that song!

3282
02:13:08,550 --> 02:13:10,730
When are they ever gonna fix that word pipe?

3283
02:13:15,750 --> 02:13:17,770
Oh my god, he's so cute!

3284
02:13:26,990 --> 02:13:32,730
I just... I think I found out recently about that, that Cucaracha was cockroach.

3285
02:13:32,890 --> 02:13:34,030
But it's so catchy.

3286
02:13:37,590 --> 02:13:38,810
He's so cute!

3287
02:13:39,150 --> 02:13:40,010
The skelly guy!

3288
02:13:43,010 --> 02:13:44,310
What's this song about?

3289
02:13:44,730 --> 02:13:45,750
Just cockroaches?

3290
02:13:46,250 --> 02:13:48,490
What even... wait, what is that song about anyway?

3291
02:13:51,190 --> 02:13:54,810
Yeah, Cucaracha is like... it's like cockroach.

3292
02:14:02,750 --> 02:14:05,750
Yeah, it sounds cute until you realize it's...

3293
02:14:08,070 --> 02:14:09,670
It's just cockroach?

3294
02:14:11,290 --> 02:14:12,370
Wait, what?

3295
02:14:12,370 --> 02:14:16,830
The cockroach keeps dancing while losing legs?

3296
02:14:17,030 --> 02:14:18,330
What the fuck?

3297
02:14:23,520 --> 02:14:24,560
Wait...

3298
02:14:24,560 --> 02:14:28,080
The cow... but it sounds so happy!

3299
02:14:28,840 --> 02:14:29,720
They're like...

3300
02:14:29,720 --> 02:14:30,620
Le-ca-ca-da-cha!

3301
02:14:30,800 --> 02:14:31,840
Le-ca-ca-da-cha!

3302
02:14:32,380 --> 02:14:33,500
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da!

3303
02:14:33,640 --> 02:14:34,880
Le-ca-ca-da-cha!

3304
02:14:35,120 --> 02:14:36,060
Le-ca-ca-da-cha!

3305
02:14:36,320 --> 02:14:37,580
Yeah, and it's like...

3306
02:14:37,580 --> 02:14:39,580
Please, this cockroach can't move!

3307
02:14:39,760 --> 02:14:40,880
His legs are gone!

3308
02:14:40,880 --> 02:14:43,240
A-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

3309
02:14:43,400 --> 02:14:44,480
Because it's out.

3310
02:14:44,520 --> 02:14:45,160
What's this?

3311
02:14:45,300 --> 02:14:46,280
I cannot walk!

3312
02:14:46,520 --> 02:14:46,880
He says...

3313
02:14:47,740 --> 02:14:48,300
Yippee!

3314
02:14:49,580 --> 02:14:50,140
Yippee!

3315
02:14:50,320 --> 02:14:51,200
He can't walk!

3316
02:14:53,080 --> 02:14:55,160
It's like London Bridge is falling down.

3317
02:14:55,640 --> 02:14:57,280
It's like... like children keep saying it's like...

3318
02:14:57,280 --> 02:14:59,220
London Bridge is falling down.

3319
02:14:59,440 --> 02:15:00,420
Falling down.

3320
02:15:00,660 --> 02:15:01,560
Falling down.

3321
02:15:01,800 --> 02:15:03,920
London Bridge is falling down.

3322
02:15:06,100 --> 02:15:12,200
But it's literally documenting that bridge actually falling down.

3323
02:15:12,320 --> 02:15:13,780
That caused a lot of deaths.

3324
02:15:14,200 --> 02:15:15,460
And then children are like, Yay!

3325
02:15:15,840 --> 02:15:18,280
Let's make a nursery rhyme about this!

3326
02:15:18,800 --> 02:15:19,120
Yeah!

3327
02:15:23,320 --> 02:15:26,400
My fit lady, ring around the pos...

3328
02:15:26,400 --> 02:15:26,940
Oh, is it?

3329
02:15:27,060 --> 02:15:29,780
Yeah, was it ring around the posy about death as well?

3330
02:15:32,120 --> 02:15:34,540
Ashes, ashes, we all fall down.

3331
02:15:35,760 --> 02:15:37,760
Yeah, the ring around the rosy is about the play.

3332
02:15:40,020 --> 02:15:41,120
How did it go again?

3333
02:15:41,160 --> 02:15:41,780
I don't remember.

3334
02:15:41,900 --> 02:15:42,560
It's been so long.

3335
02:15:42,880 --> 02:15:44,360
Matt, thank you for the super chat.

3336
02:15:44,560 --> 02:15:45,340
Thank you.

3337
02:15:47,200 --> 02:15:50,560
I would like to be named after a mom for no particular reason at all.

3338
02:15:51,320 --> 02:15:52,240
Thank you to the super chat.

3339
02:15:52,360 --> 02:15:53,200
Thank you, thank you.

3340
02:15:55,120 --> 02:15:56,840
Francisco, thank you to the super chat.

3341
02:15:56,920 --> 02:15:57,600
Thank you, thank you.

3342
02:15:57,740 --> 02:15:59,760
There's many... Oh yeah, I already read that one.

3343
02:16:00,460 --> 02:16:00,620
Yay!

3344
02:16:06,620 --> 02:16:07,340
Flown away!

3345
02:16:09,120 --> 02:16:09,480
Yay!

3346
02:16:11,780 --> 02:16:14,640
Any wild... Oh, it's a wild... Oh, it's in here.

3347
02:16:15,100 --> 02:16:16,080
Okay, it's in this area.

3348
02:16:16,080 --> 02:16:19,240
There's so many... There's so many long goons.

3349
02:16:27,360 --> 02:16:29,220
It no longer work.

3350
02:16:29,480 --> 02:16:31,500
I actually don't know how to pronounce it.

3351
02:16:33,220 --> 02:16:35,580
I just remembered the cockroach part.

3352
02:16:36,680 --> 02:16:37,960
But Gus, thank you to the super chat.

3353
02:16:38,100 --> 02:16:39,000
Thank you, thank you.

3354
02:16:39,380 --> 02:16:42,080
Because she's lacking the two hind legs.

3355
02:16:42,220 --> 02:16:42,560
Jesus.

3356
02:16:47,690 --> 02:16:48,930
I already got all of them.

3357
02:16:49,110 --> 02:16:49,370
I don't...

3358
02:16:49,370 --> 02:16:51,170
How do I have all these mines already?

3359
02:16:54,630 --> 02:16:57,210
I don't think... I don't think this is a stretch of the desert.

3360
02:16:57,210 --> 02:16:58,130
This desert is too big.

3361
02:16:58,570 --> 02:17:01,170
It shouldn't be much longer to arrive in Tostarina.

3362
02:17:03,110 --> 02:17:03,990
Yeah, Tostarina.

3363
02:17:05,470 --> 02:17:05,910
Nice.

3364
02:17:06,110 --> 02:17:06,870
Oh, super rappel.

3365
02:17:06,990 --> 02:17:07,550
Okay, let's see.

3366
02:17:07,870 --> 02:17:09,830
Have I got all the mons for this area?

3367
02:17:10,890 --> 02:17:12,870
Count how much Xander is, grunt.

3368
02:17:13,130 --> 02:17:14,530
That's your first mission.

3369
02:17:15,370 --> 02:17:15,810
Okay.

3370
02:17:16,790 --> 02:17:18,830
One, two, three.

3371
02:17:19,330 --> 02:17:21,330
Why would you make him do that?

3372
02:17:22,190 --> 02:17:24,830
Four, five, six.

3373
02:17:25,730 --> 02:17:26,790
It passes time.

3374
02:17:27,070 --> 02:17:28,050
Oh, that's something I do.

3375
02:17:29,210 --> 02:17:31,790
It's gonna take so long.

3376
02:17:33,610 --> 02:17:39,150
Six, seven, eight, nine, Koopa Patrol.

3377
02:17:39,970 --> 02:17:41,510
Ten, eleven.

3378
02:17:42,210 --> 02:17:44,790
It's going to be so annoying.

3379
02:17:45,770 --> 02:17:48,250
I'm curious what the biggest number is.

3380
02:17:48,830 --> 02:17:51,830
Twelve, eighteen, fourteen, six.

3381
02:17:52,010 --> 02:17:53,230
Oh my god, he keeps...

3382
02:17:53,670 --> 02:17:54,970
How long does this go?

3383
02:17:54,970 --> 02:17:59,370
There are only 30 million sand particles in this desert.

3384
02:18:00,770 --> 02:18:01,250
See?

3385
02:18:01,530 --> 02:18:02,670
That was easy.

3386
02:18:03,410 --> 02:18:04,470
Oh, my stars.

3387
02:18:05,870 --> 02:18:06,930
I love that.

3388
02:18:07,190 --> 02:18:08,410
Oh, is that a reference?

3389
02:18:10,230 --> 02:18:10,910
To a...

3390
02:18:10,910 --> 02:18:11,850
Oh, to a Sonic...

3391
02:18:12,690 --> 02:18:14,870
Uh, the Super Snap Cube?

3392
02:18:15,110 --> 02:18:16,170
Never heard of that one.

3393
02:18:18,330 --> 02:18:19,510
Hey, thank you for the super chat.

3394
02:18:19,610 --> 02:18:20,270
Thank you, thank you.

3395
02:18:20,330 --> 02:18:22,510
You see us Mexicans likes to enjoy...

3396
02:18:23,250 --> 02:18:24,510
likes to take the joy.

3397
02:18:25,810 --> 02:18:26,250
Uh...

3398
02:18:26,250 --> 02:18:27,130
What's this over here?

3399
02:18:27,610 --> 02:18:29,590
It takes the joy and the tragedy of the area of things.

3400
02:18:29,730 --> 02:18:31,750
It helps discover the iron things that seem too dark.

3401
02:18:33,450 --> 02:18:34,290
Traversing a desert?

3402
02:18:34,490 --> 02:18:36,210
It really takes a ton on the body.

3403
02:18:37,930 --> 02:18:39,610
Lucky to get into...

3404
02:18:39,610 --> 02:18:40,150
Tostarina.

3405
02:18:42,870 --> 02:18:45,370
Gotta have a little bit of an accent there.

3406
02:18:46,130 --> 02:18:46,570
Tostarina.

3407
02:18:47,670 --> 02:18:49,270
I hope that's actually how it's pronounced.

3408
02:18:50,690 --> 02:18:51,450
Nostee!

3409
02:18:52,110 --> 02:18:52,230
Nostee!

3410
02:18:53,970 --> 02:18:54,730
Nostee!

3411
02:18:54,730 --> 02:18:54,790
Nostee!

3412
02:18:54,790 --> 02:18:54,810
Nostee!

3413
02:18:55,530 --> 02:18:55,890
Crush him.

3414
02:18:58,910 --> 02:18:59,670
Alright.

3415
02:19:01,350 --> 02:19:02,110
Yay!

3416
02:19:02,630 --> 02:19:04,190
How old is Snap Cube anyway?

3417
02:19:11,910 --> 02:19:13,190
How old is that?

3418
02:19:19,670 --> 02:19:20,230
Yeah.

3419
02:19:21,150 --> 02:19:22,330
How long ago was that?

3420
02:19:29,130 --> 02:19:29,490
Yay!

3421
02:19:31,170 --> 02:19:31,730
Go high!

3422
02:19:32,070 --> 02:19:33,510
Oh, he was like guarding it.

3423
02:19:34,770 --> 02:19:36,230
Oh, it wasn't even that old.

3424
02:19:36,530 --> 02:19:37,870
I thought it was like, old old.

3425
02:19:39,590 --> 02:19:40,630
Oh, it's a bully!

3426
02:19:41,890 --> 02:19:42,250
Alright.

3427
02:19:42,990 --> 02:19:44,050
Let's get him in here.

3428
02:19:46,450 --> 02:19:46,930
Uh...

3429
02:19:47,970 --> 02:19:49,630
The only thing I can do is lick it.

3430
02:19:50,270 --> 02:19:52,410
That's like, literally my shittiest move.

3431
02:19:52,910 --> 02:19:54,270
Everybody else can like...

3432
02:19:54,270 --> 02:19:56,110
Everything else can like, almost kill him.

3433
02:19:58,310 --> 02:19:59,830
Actually, I'll try Egg Bomb.

3434
02:20:02,450 --> 02:20:03,810
Oh, it's not very effective.

3435
02:20:03,810 --> 02:20:04,250
Okay.

3436
02:20:05,490 --> 02:20:05,970
Okay.

3437
02:20:08,970 --> 02:20:09,450
Uh...

3438
02:20:09,450 --> 02:20:10,370
I'll lick it then.

3439
02:20:12,310 --> 02:20:13,390
Okay, yeah, that's...

3440
02:20:13,390 --> 02:20:14,030
Oh, that's okay.

3441
02:20:14,270 --> 02:20:14,650
It's planned.

3442
02:20:16,990 --> 02:20:18,350
It's okay, guys.

3443
02:20:18,630 --> 02:20:19,730
It was planned.

3444
02:20:23,450 --> 02:20:24,990
I'm gonna put Heffely in here.

3445
02:20:28,540 --> 02:20:29,180
Alright.

3446
02:20:32,040 --> 02:20:33,360
That should be fine.

3447
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:38,240
Alright, get into this baseball cap.

3448
02:20:41,990 --> 02:20:42,610
Yay!

3449
02:20:43,390 --> 02:20:44,090
He knows...

3450
02:20:44,090 --> 02:20:44,790
Oh, he...

3451
02:20:44,790 --> 02:20:46,070
He doesn't know.

3452
02:20:48,970 --> 02:20:50,970
He signed the NDA not knowing.

3453
02:20:51,090 --> 02:20:52,550
He didn't listen to his friends.

3454
02:20:53,530 --> 02:20:54,950
A living spear of metal.

3455
02:20:55,130 --> 02:20:57,510
In groups, they assert dominance by shoving one another.

3456
02:20:57,850 --> 02:21:01,030
It's often hunted for its shell made of rare metals.

3457
02:21:01,030 --> 02:21:02,330
All right.

3458
02:21:02,590 --> 02:21:03,230
All right.

3459
02:21:04,830 --> 02:21:05,290
Matt.

3460
02:21:05,590 --> 02:21:05,910
Matt Goon.

3461
02:21:10,810 --> 02:21:11,370
Matt.

3462
02:21:13,410 --> 02:21:13,970
Uh...

3463
02:21:13,970 --> 02:21:14,430
Smug!

3464
02:21:14,530 --> 02:21:15,370
Thank you for the super chat.

3465
02:21:15,470 --> 02:21:15,690
Thank you.

3466
02:21:15,770 --> 02:21:16,190
Thank you.

3467
02:21:16,350 --> 02:21:16,830
It depends.

3468
02:21:17,010 --> 02:21:17,830
What does it mean?

3469
02:21:21,190 --> 02:21:28,990
I've been a streamer for too long to not randomly say things in another language when I don't know what it means.

3470
02:21:31,190 --> 02:21:32,790
Don't worry about it.

3471
02:21:33,070 --> 02:21:33,330
Don't worry about it.

3472
02:21:33,330 --> 02:21:33,550
All right.

3473
02:21:33,970 --> 02:21:35,530
I'm never saying it.

3474
02:21:39,230 --> 02:21:41,050
Wait, what are you doing back there?

3475
02:21:41,050 --> 02:21:41,850
Okay.

3476
02:21:44,610 --> 02:21:45,650
Who do you excited?

3477
02:21:47,770 --> 02:21:48,290
No!

3478
02:21:51,310 --> 02:21:52,990
I want me to say it.

3479
02:21:53,070 --> 02:21:54,930
You gotta give me a better bribe.

3480
02:22:05,620 --> 02:22:07,320
Okay, I already have all of these guys.

3481
02:22:07,320 --> 02:22:08,980
I'm missing like one, right?

3482
02:22:12,880 --> 02:22:14,020
Oh, I'm in Toast Arena.

3483
02:22:14,980 --> 02:22:15,460
Hey there.

3484
02:22:16,080 --> 02:22:17,200
Did you come from Toe Town?

3485
02:22:17,660 --> 02:22:20,460
Sorry about the warp pipe not working properly.

3486
02:22:20,920 --> 02:22:23,720
We've run into some issues and could really use the help.

3487
02:22:25,580 --> 02:22:27,040
There's toads here too?

3488
02:22:28,440 --> 02:22:34,220
All the tourists bound for Metro Kingdom are getting a little antsy about being blocked in.

3489
02:22:34,360 --> 02:22:35,920
No, not the tourists.

3490
02:22:36,660 --> 02:22:39,800
And lastly, we have Kamek trying to freeze.

3491
02:22:40,920 --> 02:22:42,300
The entire desert.

3492
02:22:44,980 --> 02:22:47,600
Get that one away from Kamek, please.

3493
02:22:51,790 --> 02:22:52,930
I was gonna say.

3494
02:22:53,850 --> 02:22:54,730
I cannot.

3495
02:22:55,350 --> 02:22:57,290
There's like regular toads here.

3496
02:22:58,270 --> 02:22:59,090
Oh, it's a photo.

3497
02:23:02,640 --> 02:23:03,540
All right.

3498
02:23:03,720 --> 02:23:03,960
Nice.

3499
02:23:05,480 --> 02:23:07,680
This is what it was meant to snatch.

3500
02:23:08,180 --> 02:23:09,780
That doesn't look very important.

3501
02:23:10,560 --> 02:23:11,140
What's that?

3502
02:23:11,340 --> 02:23:12,580
What am I doing in this corner?

3503
02:23:12,980 --> 02:23:13,440
Nothing.

3504
02:23:13,840 --> 02:23:14,580
Now scram.

3505
02:23:16,060 --> 02:23:17,280
Welcome to Toast Arena.

3506
02:23:17,700 --> 02:23:19,240
We're a bit out of a small town.

3507
02:23:19,660 --> 02:23:21,880
I realize a rest stop is quite important.

3508
02:23:22,200 --> 02:23:25,140
We get all sorts of folks coming and going.

3509
02:23:27,940 --> 02:23:30,880
The kid over there likes playing heroes with us.

3510
02:23:31,160 --> 02:23:32,560
Who am I saying no?

3511
02:23:33,100 --> 02:23:35,460
Even gave us rocks, glutes, and nuts.

3512
02:23:35,800 --> 02:23:35,960
Wait.

3513
02:23:36,040 --> 02:23:36,840
Are these all children?

3514
02:23:37,720 --> 02:23:39,080
Don't tell them I can talk.

3515
02:23:39,980 --> 02:23:41,180
All right, local heroes.

3516
02:23:41,440 --> 02:23:43,140
Let's use our powers for good.

3517
02:23:43,580 --> 02:23:44,600
Smash, smash, smash.

3518
02:23:46,500 --> 02:23:48,560
Sometimes I'll play along in kids' games.

3519
02:23:48,560 --> 02:23:49,780
And he's getting out of work.

3520
02:23:49,960 --> 02:23:51,040
Oh, there's children here.

3521
02:23:53,920 --> 02:23:55,840
May he come back save months from now?

3522
02:23:56,240 --> 02:23:56,620
Okay.

3523
02:23:57,240 --> 02:23:58,340
I can't go here.

3524
02:23:59,680 --> 02:24:00,540
What does he say?

3525
02:24:00,760 --> 02:24:02,780
Oh, I already talked to him.

3526
02:24:04,860 --> 02:24:06,840
Okay, so this is 6-2.

3527
02:24:07,840 --> 02:24:09,120
All right, I'm in Toast Arena.

3528
02:24:12,380 --> 02:24:13,960
Oh, you're mighty, aren't you?

3529
02:24:14,260 --> 02:24:16,360
Can you tell this child man to calm down?

3530
02:24:16,920 --> 02:24:18,500
Maybe I'll listen to a hero like you.

3531
02:24:18,560 --> 02:24:19,620
Oh my god, I'm famous?

3532
02:24:20,320 --> 02:24:21,260
Oh my god.

3533
02:24:21,900 --> 02:24:24,420
I'm famous and they still make me pay for things?

3534
02:24:30,540 --> 02:24:31,460
I'm a hero.

3535
02:24:35,520 --> 02:24:36,780
The cap challenge.

3536
02:24:37,220 --> 02:24:38,620
I hope I can participate.

3537
02:24:38,800 --> 02:24:40,140
Can I, can I, can I, can I?

3538
02:24:42,020 --> 02:24:43,540
I should get free caps.

3539
02:24:46,080 --> 02:24:48,360
Isn't Toast Arena desert amazing?

3540
02:24:48,980 --> 02:24:51,120
There's so much history to explore here.

3541
02:24:52,100 --> 02:24:53,160
Welcome to Toast Arena.

3542
02:24:53,680 --> 02:24:54,280
Sorry, oh wait.

3543
02:24:55,700 --> 02:24:56,980
Through the painting in the tower.

3544
02:24:57,140 --> 02:24:58,400
Oh, I can just jump into...

3545
02:24:58,400 --> 02:25:00,020
Oh, it's like Super Mario.

3546
02:25:01,060 --> 02:25:03,220
64, I can just jump into the painting.

3547
02:25:04,260 --> 02:25:04,840
Oh dear.

3548
02:25:05,640 --> 02:25:07,020
Where did I put my umbrella?

3549
02:25:07,500 --> 02:25:08,800
Did I forget it somewhere?

3550
02:25:09,560 --> 02:25:10,380
Hello there.

3551
02:25:10,600 --> 02:25:12,240
Sorry I didn't hear you come in.

3552
02:25:12,980 --> 02:25:15,160
I was busy searching for my umbrella.

3553
02:25:16,140 --> 02:25:16,960
Is that a quest book?

3554
02:25:17,200 --> 02:25:19,000
Then you're accepting people's trouble then, correct?

3555
02:25:19,480 --> 02:25:21,060
Do you think you can help me find my umbrella?

3556
02:25:21,500 --> 02:25:25,200
As I remember it, I was out for a nice stroll near the front of town.

3557
02:25:25,920 --> 02:25:26,180
Okay.

3558
02:25:27,660 --> 02:25:28,300
Don't worry.

3559
02:25:28,300 --> 02:25:30,040
It means I will not do this quest.

3560
02:25:30,880 --> 02:25:32,120
I'm almost to the tower.

3561
02:25:32,640 --> 02:25:35,160
I need to get to Metro Kingdom as fast as possible.

3562
02:25:36,160 --> 02:25:36,940
What's over here?

3563
02:25:37,560 --> 02:25:38,320
Oh, it's another...

3564
02:25:38,320 --> 02:25:39,960
Oh, it's just an extra item.

3565
02:25:44,340 --> 02:25:45,180
All right, here we go.

3566
02:25:47,440 --> 02:25:49,480
Yay, a big nugget!

3567
02:25:50,520 --> 02:25:53,200
I can't believe I was worried about those loan sharks.

3568
02:25:54,540 --> 02:25:54,940
Wow!

3569
02:25:55,300 --> 02:25:56,820
This desert sure is fast!

3570
02:25:57,800 --> 02:25:59,080
I'm so silly.

3571
02:25:59,340 --> 02:26:00,320
I can't believe it.

3572
02:26:01,100 --> 02:26:04,380
I didn't even want to go to the Mario Kingdom in the first place.

3573
02:26:04,660 --> 02:26:06,180
And now I'm stuck in the desert.

3574
02:26:07,100 --> 02:26:07,760
Don't worry.

3575
02:26:08,260 --> 02:26:09,720
The desert will figure something out.

3576
02:26:10,460 --> 02:26:12,800
What's going to happen to our trip to Metro Kingdom?

3577
02:26:13,780 --> 02:26:15,120
Mario, is that you?

3578
02:26:15,500 --> 02:26:17,120
Thank goodness I tripped the same.

3579
02:26:17,520 --> 02:26:17,860
Oh, yeah.

3580
02:26:19,360 --> 02:26:20,380
They're talking about tourism.

3581
02:26:20,700 --> 02:26:23,600
It reminded me of the live-action Lilo and Stitch movie.

3582
02:26:23,900 --> 02:26:26,820
And, like, at first the audience review was really, really good.

3583
02:26:26,900 --> 02:26:28,720
But the creators review was, like, not good.

3584
02:26:28,820 --> 02:26:30,220
So people were like, what the fuck?

3585
02:26:30,400 --> 02:26:31,760
And then it was so funny.

3586
02:26:31,940 --> 02:26:35,380
So, like, spoiler alert for the ending of the live-action Lilo and Stitch movie.

3587
02:26:35,740 --> 02:26:39,480
But, like, Nani gave up Lilo to foster care.

3588
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:44,340
So she could pursue a university degree outside of Hawaii.

3589
02:26:46,080 --> 02:26:47,700
I was like, what?

3590
02:26:49,040 --> 02:26:50,840
What happened to Ohana?

3591
02:26:52,800 --> 02:26:53,420
Yeah!

3592
02:26:53,860 --> 02:26:56,200
I was like, is that Ohana?

3593
02:26:56,200 --> 02:26:57,080
Ohana?

3594
02:26:57,080 --> 02:26:57,720
And then...

3595
02:26:57,720 --> 02:26:58,940
Yes!

3596
02:26:59,800 --> 02:26:59,940
Yes!

3597
02:26:59,940 --> 02:27:07,540
Nani, like, abandoned Lilo with her, with her, like, quote-unquote boyfriend.

3598
02:27:07,560 --> 02:27:09,100
But they're not even, like...

3599
02:27:09,100 --> 02:27:10,740
Marine biology, by the way.

3600
02:27:10,920 --> 02:27:15,580
She wants to study marine biology outside of Hawaii.

3601
02:27:15,960 --> 02:27:18,500
An island surrounded by the marine.

3602
02:27:21,960 --> 02:27:23,220
Ohana means college!

3603
02:27:25,760 --> 02:27:27,260
So then she, like...

3604
02:27:27,260 --> 02:27:31,800
She, like, gave up her sister to, like...

3605
02:27:31,800 --> 02:27:34,120
Like, her neighbor and her, like...

3606
02:27:34,120 --> 02:27:36,080
She doesn't even get with the guy, too.

3607
02:27:36,120 --> 02:27:37,300
You know, like, what's his name?

3608
02:27:37,480 --> 02:27:38,460
David, right?

3609
02:27:38,740 --> 02:27:39,880
I forgot his name.

3610
02:27:40,040 --> 02:27:42,660
Because he's, like, usually he's just, like, Nani's plus one.

3611
02:27:44,620 --> 02:27:46,680
But, like, they don't even get together.

3612
02:27:46,680 --> 02:27:51,600
But she, like, gave up Lilo to, like, the neighbor and David.

3613
02:27:51,780 --> 02:27:54,640
But they don't even get together in the end.

3614
02:27:54,980 --> 02:27:56,140
And then, like...

3615
02:27:56,140 --> 02:27:59,260
And then there's a scene in there where, like...

3616
02:27:59,260 --> 02:28:01,320
You know how, like, Lilo...

3617
02:28:01,320 --> 02:28:03,440
Okay, they showed a comparison.

3618
02:28:03,720 --> 02:28:07,040
But, like, Nani tries to get rid of Stitch.

3619
02:28:07,220 --> 02:28:09,760
And then Lilo was like, That's not what that meant!

3620
02:28:10,140 --> 02:28:11,860
Ohana means family!

3621
02:28:12,540 --> 02:28:15,000
And no one gets left behind!

3622
02:28:15,440 --> 02:28:17,120
And Nani was like, You're right.

3623
02:28:17,320 --> 02:28:18,380
You're right, Lilo.

3624
02:28:18,540 --> 02:28:20,340
I hate it when you use dad's words against me.

3625
02:28:20,520 --> 02:28:22,440
And then in the live action...

3626
02:28:22,440 --> 02:28:25,620
Like, they made it so that Nani was like...

3627
02:28:25,620 --> 02:28:27,860
Was like, This is the real world!

3628
02:28:28,120 --> 02:28:29,340
This is reality!

3629
02:28:29,920 --> 02:28:32,160
Our family left us!

3630
02:28:32,540 --> 02:28:35,980
But then, like, if you know the story of Lilo and Stitch...

3631
02:28:35,980 --> 02:28:37,220
Their family...

3632
02:28:37,220 --> 02:28:40,240
Their parents literally died in a car crash.

3633
02:28:40,240 --> 02:28:42,160
So it's like...

3634
02:28:42,160 --> 02:28:44,760
What do you mean your family left you?

3635
02:28:45,760 --> 02:28:46,130
They're...

3636
02:28:46,760 --> 02:28:47,500
They're...

3637
02:28:47,500 --> 02:28:47,880
They're...

3638
02:28:47,880 --> 02:28:48,440
Like, what?

3639
02:28:50,840 --> 02:28:51,580
Like...

3640
02:28:51,580 --> 02:28:52,580
Like...

3641
02:28:53,760 --> 02:28:54,500
Like...

3642
02:28:54,500 --> 02:28:55,460
Yeah, they're...

3643
02:28:55,460 --> 02:28:58,000
It's like, Welcome to the real world!

3644
02:28:58,160 --> 02:28:59,100
This is reality!

3645
02:28:59,800 --> 02:29:00,440
Like...

3646
02:29:00,440 --> 02:29:01,940
Like, what the fuck?

3647
02:29:02,280 --> 02:29:04,020
They don't even talk about Hano!

3648
02:29:09,080 --> 02:29:11,740
You think they picked to leave you?

3649
02:29:12,320 --> 02:29:13,700
I'm like...

3650
02:29:14,680 --> 02:29:18,720
Ohana got lost in translation in the real world!

3651
02:29:20,040 --> 02:29:21,160
Mr. My...

3652
02:29:21,160 --> 02:29:22,140
Oh, it's Toads Rift!

3653
02:29:22,420 --> 02:29:24,580
Were you also tempted to go to the Mario Kingdom?

3654
02:29:24,580 --> 02:29:28,540
I was given the duty of bringing this group of Toads there as well!

3655
02:29:28,680 --> 02:29:31,120
I don't see if we found ourselves stuck here!

3656
02:29:31,580 --> 02:29:32,180
What's worse?

3657
02:29:32,520 --> 02:29:34,420
Sorry, a group has gotten lost in the desert!

3658
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:35,820
Master Mario!

3659
02:29:36,200 --> 02:29:38,780
I wish to ask for your help in this matter!

3660
02:29:39,280 --> 02:29:42,720
I don't feel much tested in order to ensure you're prepared for the harsh desert!

3661
02:29:43,680 --> 02:29:44,160
Yeah...

3662
02:29:44,720 --> 02:29:45,660
Yeah, they like...

3663
02:29:45,660 --> 02:29:47,000
Yeah, it's so weird!

3664
02:29:47,360 --> 02:29:47,860
And then for...

3665
02:29:47,860 --> 02:29:48,800
And then like the...

3666
02:29:48,800 --> 02:29:51,500
The live action of the Stitch movie ended up getting like...

3667
02:29:51,500 --> 02:29:52,520
Good audience review!

3668
02:29:52,660 --> 02:29:53,560
And I was like...

3669
02:29:53,560 --> 02:29:53,920
What?

3670
02:29:56,540 --> 02:29:58,740
By the way, this is a different topic!

3671
02:29:59,100 --> 02:29:59,920
But like...

3672
02:29:59,920 --> 02:30:01,360
This is related because like...

3673
02:30:01,360 --> 02:30:02,940
I'm thinking about like reviews and stuff!

3674
02:30:03,120 --> 02:30:04,200
But you know how like...

3675
02:30:04,200 --> 02:30:05,420
In the Oscars...

3676
02:30:05,420 --> 02:30:07,460
People who vote in the Oscars...

3677
02:30:07,460 --> 02:30:10,200
Like the nominees and then which movie wins...

3678
02:30:10,200 --> 02:30:12,560
They don't have to watch any of the movies!

3679
02:30:12,560 --> 02:30:13,920
It's not a requirement!

3680
02:30:14,180 --> 02:30:17,820
But they recently made it a requirement that you have to watch the movies!

3681
02:30:18,200 --> 02:30:19,040
But then like...

3682
02:30:19,040 --> 02:30:21,200
They're now saying that...

3683
02:30:22,200 --> 02:30:25,480
Now like some of the Oscar voters are like...

3684
02:30:25,480 --> 02:30:27,120
Oh yeah, there's like a pro...

3685
02:30:27,120 --> 02:30:27,960
We have to like...

3686
02:30:27,960 --> 02:30:31,040
We could just leave the program running as if we're watching the movie!

3687
02:30:31,280 --> 02:30:35,080
So they would just leave the program running on the side if it's a movie that they don't want to watch!

3688
02:30:35,200 --> 02:30:35,700
And I'm like...

3689
02:30:35,700 --> 02:30:37,360
Why are you in the committee?!

3690
02:30:37,360 --> 02:30:40,260
Leave the committee if you don't want to watch the movie!

3691
02:30:40,480 --> 02:30:42,080
But the thing is...

3692
02:30:42,080 --> 02:30:46,780
You know, like the publisher... what is it called?

3693
02:30:46,900 --> 02:30:47,860
The book awards?

3694
02:30:48,140 --> 02:30:50,840
There's like a similar thing for books.

3695
02:30:51,060 --> 02:30:58,800
But it is a requirement that you read all the books to vote in the... I forgot what it's called.

3696
02:30:59,360 --> 02:31:01,780
It's like there's a book equivalent of the Oscars.

3697
02:31:02,380 --> 02:31:03,660
The Pulitzers, yeah.

3698
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:11,780
For the Pulitzers, people who are in the Pulitzers Committee, they have to read every book that gets nominated.

3699
02:31:13,240 --> 02:31:17,260
And like, they actually have to or they're kicked out of the committee.

3700
02:31:17,800 --> 02:31:23,840
So like, people are like, okay, so like, there are people that are willing to read all of the books.

3701
02:31:24,180 --> 02:31:31,360
But like, in the Oscars, people don't want to watch a movie?

3702
02:31:31,680 --> 02:31:34,460
Is it really harder to watch movies?

3703
02:31:34,840 --> 02:31:37,560
It's because you don't get... yeah, no, Nexi, you're so right.

3704
02:31:37,560 --> 02:31:44,140
It's because like, who would want to... book author... book writers don't have enough money to bribe the book voters.

3705
02:31:44,660 --> 02:31:47,160
Like, think about it.

3706
02:31:47,480 --> 02:31:51,740
Unless your book becomes a multi-million dollar cinematic universe.

3707
02:31:52,020 --> 02:31:55,260
You don't have the money to bribe the book voters.

3708
02:31:58,400 --> 02:31:58,720
Like...

3709
02:31:59,900 --> 02:32:00,220
Um...

3710
02:32:01,120 --> 02:32:01,440
Um...

3711
02:32:01,440 --> 02:32:02,020
Let's see.

3712
02:32:05,020 --> 02:32:05,340
Uh...

3713
02:32:05,340 --> 02:32:07,100
Lord Crow says, thank you for the super chat.

3714
02:32:07,220 --> 02:32:08,080
Thank you, thank you.

3715
02:32:08,220 --> 02:32:11,520
Hey, Doki, can I reserve a spot for Johnny as the next Mario mod?

3716
02:32:11,680 --> 02:32:12,120
You catch it?

3717
02:32:12,240 --> 02:32:12,760
Here's the super chat.

3718
02:32:12,840 --> 02:32:13,700
Thank you, thank you.

3719
02:32:13,760 --> 02:32:14,760
I'll try to remember it.

3720
02:32:15,020 --> 02:32:16,160
Kuma, thank you for the super chat.

3721
02:32:16,220 --> 02:32:16,940
Thank you, thank you.

3722
02:32:17,160 --> 02:32:19,580
Thanks, Doki, you convinced me to not go watch the movie.

3723
02:32:19,760 --> 02:32:21,960
You know, I never planned to in the first place.

3724
02:32:21,960 --> 02:32:23,720
I just thought it was fucked up.

3725
02:32:23,920 --> 02:32:26,440
That like, Ohana just disappeared.

3726
02:32:27,120 --> 02:32:27,700
Like...

3727
02:32:29,960 --> 02:32:30,800
Oh...

3728
02:32:30,800 --> 02:32:34,860
Like, like the whole message with the movie was about family.

3729
02:32:35,180 --> 02:32:36,840
And then Nani just...

3730
02:32:36,840 --> 02:32:37,560
Like...

3731
02:32:37,560 --> 02:32:42,460
Nani fucking abandons Lilo to pursue marine biology.

3732
02:32:43,100 --> 02:32:43,800
Like...

3733
02:32:44,720 --> 02:32:46,160
Like, what the fuck?

3734
02:32:48,880 --> 02:32:50,760
Ohana in this economy?

3735
02:32:50,760 --> 02:32:52,760
Oh yeah, then they made Jumba.

3736
02:32:53,260 --> 02:32:54,980
I like how someone said Jabba.

3737
02:32:55,260 --> 02:32:58,240
But they made Jumba into a villain and got rid of his accent.

3738
02:32:58,600 --> 02:32:59,760
Now he's just American.

3739
02:33:00,860 --> 02:33:03,520
He made Jumba sound so fucking weird.

3740
02:33:03,800 --> 02:33:05,660
Now he just sounds like an American.

3741
02:33:06,500 --> 02:33:08,920
And then he like, they made him the villain.

3742
02:33:09,060 --> 02:33:10,200
Yeah, he has no accent.

3743
02:33:10,360 --> 02:33:10,480
Wait.

3744
02:33:10,940 --> 02:33:11,740
Oh my god.

3745
02:33:11,900 --> 02:33:12,260
Wait, okay.

3746
02:33:12,480 --> 02:33:15,220
After this battle, let me see if I can find a clip of his accent.

3747
02:33:15,460 --> 02:33:17,340
Because even I was like, what the fuck?

3748
02:33:24,350 --> 02:33:26,330
Yeah, but they made him a villain.

3749
02:33:27,370 --> 02:33:28,390
Huff and Puff.

3750
02:33:28,550 --> 02:33:29,950
Oh, he's a big boy.

3751
02:33:33,250 --> 02:33:34,990
Uh, Gordon would want...

3752
02:33:34,990 --> 02:33:36,770
Oh man, Gordon would want him.

3753
02:33:36,770 --> 02:33:38,350
In the game.

3754
02:33:42,850 --> 02:33:43,490
Yay!

3755
02:33:44,390 --> 02:33:46,470
I'm like, almost there.

3756
02:33:46,870 --> 02:33:49,490
For Dragoon, for Yoshi to level up.

3757
02:33:50,030 --> 02:33:50,790
To evolve.

3758
02:33:51,930 --> 02:33:53,490
No, Gantu isn't in the movie.

3759
02:33:53,510 --> 02:33:57,610
Because it was too expensive to animate another CGI shark.

3760
02:34:02,690 --> 02:34:04,610
It's just too expensive, guys.

3761
02:34:04,770 --> 02:34:05,530
You don't understand.

3762
02:34:05,530 --> 02:34:05,890
Oh my god.

3763
02:34:10,580 --> 02:34:11,420
Wait, what?

3764
02:34:12,020 --> 02:34:12,400
No!

3765
02:34:13,000 --> 02:34:14,020
Don't hit yourself!

3766
02:34:14,820 --> 02:34:15,320
No!

3767
02:34:16,360 --> 02:34:17,960
Why are you so stupid?

3768
02:34:20,840 --> 02:34:21,360
No!

3769
02:34:21,720 --> 02:34:21,900
No!

3770
02:34:21,900 --> 02:34:23,180
Dad tripped and fell!

3771
02:34:28,420 --> 02:34:28,940
Alright.

3772
02:34:29,420 --> 02:34:30,220
It's not very effective.

3773
02:34:30,280 --> 02:34:30,840
Oh, that's fine.

3774
02:34:31,100 --> 02:34:31,540
Never mind.

3775
02:34:31,540 --> 02:34:32,300
It's not fine.

3776
02:34:33,640 --> 02:34:35,180
I'm gonna be like, that's fine.

3777
02:34:35,180 --> 02:34:36,700
I can just like, hit him again.

3778
02:34:40,980 --> 02:34:42,560
No, don't do it, Doki.

3779
02:34:42,560 --> 02:34:44,160
I know it's calling for you.

3780
02:34:44,320 --> 02:34:45,360
But don't do it.

3781
02:34:45,940 --> 02:34:47,280
Wait, what level is this guy?

3782
02:34:47,840 --> 02:34:48,400
44.

3783
02:34:48,940 --> 02:34:49,100
Okay.

3784
02:34:49,980 --> 02:34:50,740
I'll send it heavily.

3785
02:34:53,940 --> 02:34:56,000
Look, they're about saving money.

3786
02:34:56,320 --> 02:35:07,860
Also, I found out that Hollywood companies would purposely make movies, not earn enough...

3787
02:35:07,860 --> 02:35:13,140
like, make movies, like, not be box office and say they lost money on purpose.

3788
02:35:13,800 --> 02:35:15,720
Um, just so like...

3789
02:35:16,310 --> 02:35:17,900
Just so they don't have to pay the actors.

3790
02:35:18,780 --> 02:35:22,380
Because apparently, Goblet of Fire was a box office fail.

3791
02:35:23,320 --> 02:35:24,800
Which is crazy, right?

3792
02:35:27,860 --> 02:35:29,460
You know what they do?

3793
02:35:29,780 --> 02:35:30,940
They do...

3794
02:35:30,940 --> 02:35:32,440
They do a thing where...

3795
02:35:32,440 --> 02:35:38,300
I found out that, uh, they did a thing where they would pretend to loan...

3796
02:35:38,300 --> 02:35:40,220
They would set up a shell company.

3797
02:35:40,860 --> 02:35:42,760
They would set up a shell company.

3798
02:35:43,140 --> 02:35:45,040
And loan the...

3799
02:35:45,040 --> 02:35:49,140
Loan themselves an obscene amount of money.

3800
02:35:49,500 --> 02:35:52,640
And pretend that it was, like, a different company.

3801
02:35:53,240 --> 02:35:54,300
Um, just...

3802
02:35:54,300 --> 02:35:55,060
Oh my god, Hefley.

3803
02:35:55,140 --> 02:35:55,600
I'm sorry.

3804
02:35:55,840 --> 02:35:56,880
I was talking about Hollywood.

3805
02:36:00,980 --> 02:36:04,200
And, like, pretend that, like, it's, like, a different company.

3806
02:36:04,200 --> 02:36:08,060
And then they would, like, be like, okay, so we borrowed a hundred thousand dollars...

3807
02:36:08,060 --> 02:36:10,040
From the shell company to make your movie.

3808
02:36:10,300 --> 02:36:12,520
And their interest rate is, like, eighty percent.

3809
02:36:15,140 --> 02:36:16,420
Like, that's what they do.

3810
02:36:16,700 --> 02:36:17,840
Isn't that fucking crazy?

3811
02:36:20,860 --> 02:36:22,200
Just so, like...

3812
02:36:22,200 --> 02:36:24,360
Just so they don't have to pay actors.

3813
02:36:24,720 --> 02:36:25,560
And, like, direct...

3814
02:36:25,560 --> 02:36:27,260
Like, actors and writers and stuff.

3815
02:36:27,520 --> 02:36:28,200
More money.

3816
02:36:28,200 --> 02:36:29,780
Because, like, in their contracts.

3817
02:36:29,960 --> 02:36:31,620
Some actors in their contracts have it.

3818
02:36:31,780 --> 02:36:33,000
That were, um...

3819
02:36:34,280 --> 02:36:37,000
It's a percentage of what the movie makes in the end.

3820
02:36:38,360 --> 02:36:40,040
Yeah, it's a fucking T-Rex.

3821
02:36:40,240 --> 02:36:42,380
In Mario lore, the meteor never happened.

3822
02:36:44,700 --> 02:36:46,040
It's, like, revenue share.

3823
02:36:50,510 --> 02:36:51,810
I thought it was crazy.

3824
02:36:52,010 --> 02:36:53,910
That Goblet of Fire was not...

3825
02:36:53,910 --> 02:36:55,390
Was a box office fail.

3826
02:36:55,690 --> 02:36:56,810
Or, like, didn't make...

3827
02:36:56,810 --> 02:36:58,030
Didn't make enough money.

3828
02:37:03,020 --> 02:37:03,840
They, like...

3829
02:37:03,840 --> 02:37:04,420
They were like, yeah.

3830
02:37:04,720 --> 02:37:06,040
It never made enough money.

3831
02:37:06,360 --> 02:37:06,980
Like, what?

3832
02:37:08,860 --> 02:37:11,020
That's a multi-million dollar franchise.

3833
02:37:11,500 --> 02:37:12,360
What do you mean?

3834
02:37:15,060 --> 02:37:17,580
There's a lot of people obsessed with that shit.

3835
02:37:19,460 --> 02:37:21,880
Excellent job, as always, Master Mario.

3836
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:26,100
I apologize for testing you.

3837
02:37:26,280 --> 02:37:27,900
But I felt it necessary.

3838
02:37:29,000 --> 02:37:31,140
Now then, about the Lost Toad.

3839
02:37:31,520 --> 02:37:32,720
Okay, I gotta get Lost Toad.

3840
02:37:35,720 --> 02:37:38,780
I marked down their likely location in your quest book.

3841
02:37:39,000 --> 02:37:40,860
I hope you're able to deliver them safely.

3842
02:37:41,040 --> 02:37:41,820
Alright, let me save this.

3843
02:37:41,920 --> 02:37:43,260
I need to show you guys Jumbo.

3844
02:37:44,120 --> 02:37:47,740
Guys, I need to show you guys Jumbo's voice.

3845
02:37:47,740 --> 02:37:50,140
It's actually, like, very important.

3846
02:37:52,180 --> 02:37:56,980
So, it is very important in this series.

3847
02:38:00,440 --> 02:38:03,080
Jumbo, live action.

3848
02:38:04,560 --> 02:38:07,240
I need you to know what he sounds like.

3849
02:38:07,540 --> 02:38:08,720
Alright, here we go.

3850
02:38:09,760 --> 02:38:10,800
Wait, let's see.

3851
02:38:12,300 --> 02:38:12,700
Okay.

3852
02:38:13,580 --> 02:38:16,100
I need to make sure I don't have...

3853
02:38:16,100 --> 02:38:16,360
Okay.

3854
02:38:22,460 --> 02:38:25,360
Alright, there's one random guy with one like.

3855
02:38:25,560 --> 02:38:27,980
It's just gonna be like, who the fuck linked this?

3856
02:38:30,560 --> 02:38:31,460
This guy has...

3857
02:38:31,460 --> 02:38:33,420
By the way, this guy has only one like on this tweet.

3858
02:38:33,420 --> 02:38:34,760
But I just like, I...

3859
02:38:34,760 --> 02:38:35,860
It's like...

3860
02:38:35,860 --> 02:38:36,900
I just found it.

3861
02:38:37,320 --> 02:38:37,760
But...

3862
02:38:40,380 --> 02:38:43,280
It's just gonna be like, where did all these likes come from?

3863
02:38:44,440 --> 02:38:44,940
Like...

3864
02:38:50,320 --> 02:38:52,160
It's just gonna be so confused.

3865
02:38:52,400 --> 02:38:54,440
Like, where did all these likes come from?

3866
02:38:54,540 --> 02:38:55,320
What the fuck?

3867
02:38:55,320 --> 02:38:56,220
Like...

3868
02:38:56,220 --> 02:38:56,540
Like...

3869
02:38:57,640 --> 02:38:58,200
Like...

3870
02:38:58,200 --> 02:38:58,540
Like...

3871
02:38:58,540 --> 02:38:58,760
Like...

3872
02:38:58,760 --> 02:38:59,160
But...

3873
02:39:00,360 --> 02:39:01,280
But here we go.

3874
02:39:01,400 --> 02:39:03,380
Now you can hear what Jumbo sounds like.

3875
02:39:03,480 --> 02:39:04,300
Is that crazy?

3876
02:39:04,820 --> 02:39:06,140
Yeah, I know, right?

3877
02:39:06,260 --> 02:39:07,260
What the fuck?

3878
02:39:08,140 --> 02:39:09,640
What is this voice?

3879
02:39:09,880 --> 02:39:10,420
I know!

3880
02:39:10,720 --> 02:39:12,540
I'm like, what the fuck?

3881
02:39:12,860 --> 02:39:14,840
Why does he sound like that?

3882
02:39:20,720 --> 02:39:22,040
That's so silly.

3883
02:39:31,420 --> 02:39:32,400
Yeah, I know.

3884
02:39:32,580 --> 02:39:33,700
He just sounds like...

3885
02:39:33,700 --> 02:39:35,380
I don't know how to explain it.

3886
02:39:35,640 --> 02:39:38,320
I don't know how to explain it.

3887
02:39:41,970 --> 02:39:42,790
He just...

3888
02:39:42,790 --> 02:39:44,770
As I said, he sounds American.

3889
02:39:48,550 --> 02:39:51,290
Sounds like a regular guy in America.

3890
02:40:00,070 --> 02:40:02,010
Oh my god, the Ultra Nut.

3891
02:40:02,310 --> 02:40:02,910
Let's go.

3892
02:40:04,470 --> 02:40:07,130
A food full of fat that restores...

3893
02:40:08,010 --> 02:40:10,830
You want Nut, Super Nut, or an Ultra Nut?

3894
02:40:12,730 --> 02:40:14,410
Let me get Repel, just in case.

3895
02:40:19,390 --> 02:40:21,470
Oh no, I don't need to buy any caps yet.

3896
02:40:21,690 --> 02:40:22,190
Look at how...

3897
02:40:22,190 --> 02:40:23,730
I'm like, rich in caps.

3898
02:40:23,890 --> 02:40:24,110
Look.

3899
02:40:27,030 --> 02:40:28,430
Wait, when did I have 35?

3900
02:40:29,050 --> 02:40:30,170
Wait a minute.

3901
02:40:30,510 --> 02:40:31,910
I had 99.

3902
02:40:35,590 --> 02:40:37,470
When did that happen, guys?

3903
02:40:37,870 --> 02:40:38,950
That's so...

3904
02:40:38,950 --> 02:40:43,090
When did I lose my 99 caps?

3905
02:40:43,470 --> 02:40:47,270
When did I remember the mosquito?

3906
02:40:48,610 --> 02:40:49,150
Hey there.

3907
02:40:49,410 --> 02:40:50,070
Come on in.

3908
02:40:50,210 --> 02:40:52,670
We got a rest stop up inside for a strange tourist.

3909
02:40:53,110 --> 02:40:53,690
Okay, we knew.

3910
02:40:53,850 --> 02:40:55,390
Where did all my caps go?

3911
02:40:55,850 --> 02:40:56,850
Where did it all go?

3912
02:41:06,430 --> 02:41:07,130
All right.

3913
02:41:08,250 --> 02:41:08,690
Yay.

3914
02:41:11,250 --> 02:41:12,750
At least I don't know if it's...

3915
02:41:13,250 --> 02:41:14,010
I'm so loud.

3916
02:41:14,110 --> 02:41:14,950
You can track our trail.

3917
02:41:15,230 --> 02:41:17,010
Flop my style, but it's not for sale.

3918
02:41:17,630 --> 02:41:19,670
Gold across my smile while I count my scales.

3919
02:41:19,970 --> 02:41:20,910
I've been on my mind.

3920
02:41:21,010 --> 02:41:22,130
Get from out of my trails.

3921
02:41:22,450 --> 02:41:23,110
Oh my god.

3922
02:41:23,270 --> 02:41:23,930
Lin-Manuel.

3923
02:41:25,210 --> 02:41:26,850
Rip the cord with no parachute.

3924
02:41:27,190 --> 02:41:29,050
We up in the core and we prepare to shoot.

3925
02:41:29,790 --> 02:41:31,470
Rigor mortis, you scared to move.

3926
02:41:31,470 --> 02:41:34,050
Our spear enormous, we can never lose.

3927
02:41:34,970 --> 02:41:35,930
That's it, bro.

3928
02:41:36,310 --> 02:41:37,110
Lock in.

3929
02:41:37,610 --> 02:41:38,450
Oh my god.

3930
02:41:38,650 --> 02:41:40,410
The hottest track just dropped.

3931
02:41:40,970 --> 02:41:42,130
Listen to my maracas.

3932
02:41:42,370 --> 02:41:43,810
They go like, Sha-sha-sha.

3933
02:41:44,110 --> 02:41:45,310
Sha-sha-sha-sha-sha.

3934
02:41:45,530 --> 02:41:48,250
Yeah, this is why I don't talk to the people in the Pokemon Center.

3935
02:41:51,970 --> 02:41:54,650
This is why I don't talk to them there.

3936
02:41:58,210 --> 02:41:59,390
Sha-sha-sha.

3937
02:42:00,010 --> 02:42:00,490
Uh...

3938
02:42:00,490 --> 02:42:02,790
Am I only missing one mod in the desert, guys?

3939
02:42:03,050 --> 02:42:05,210
Because if we are, I'm just...

3940
02:42:05,210 --> 02:42:05,850
Because...

3941
02:42:05,850 --> 02:42:06,750
Or am I not...

3942
02:42:06,750 --> 02:42:07,910
Or did I cut all of them?

3943
02:42:11,130 --> 02:42:12,230
There's no one to be sure.

3944
02:42:12,850 --> 02:42:14,550
Welcome to the harsh desert.

3945
02:42:15,870 --> 02:42:17,890
And got some competition.

3946
02:42:24,880 --> 02:42:25,560
Because of...

3947
02:42:25,560 --> 02:42:27,260
Oh my god, it's this guy!

3948
02:42:29,600 --> 02:42:30,080
Blarg.

3949
02:42:30,080 --> 02:42:30,440
Blarg!

3950
02:42:30,440 --> 02:42:31,440
Wait, that's his name?

3951
02:42:31,920 --> 02:42:32,380
Blarg?

3952
02:42:32,700 --> 02:42:32,980
Blarg!

3953
02:42:32,980 --> 02:42:33,940
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

3954
02:42:35,480 --> 02:42:35,940
Blarg!

3955
02:42:36,460 --> 02:42:37,700
Oh shit, he's made of lava.

3956
02:42:37,880 --> 02:42:38,860
Who woulda thought...

3957
02:42:38,860 --> 02:42:42,000
Ha- I don't know why I thought he wasn't made of fire.

3958
02:42:44,360 --> 02:42:44,820
Blarg!

3959
02:42:45,400 --> 02:42:46,930
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

3960
02:42:52,810 --> 02:42:53,850
I don't know why.

3961
02:42:54,030 --> 02:42:55,930
I just somehow thought he was just...

3962
02:42:55,930 --> 02:42:57,150
Not fire-like.

3963
02:42:57,770 --> 02:42:59,450
He does look like a Blarg.

3964
02:42:59,450 --> 02:43:00,210
Yeah, he does.

3965
02:43:02,470 --> 02:43:03,290
Oh, nice.

3966
02:43:07,670 --> 02:43:09,950
I wonder, like, this guy only has one Mon.

3967
02:43:11,930 --> 02:43:13,990
I mean, all he needs is a Blarg.

3968
02:43:15,710 --> 02:43:16,110
Jesus.

3969
02:43:20,830 --> 02:43:21,370
Yay!

3970
02:43:22,230 --> 02:43:22,930
Go, Dad!

3971
02:43:23,150 --> 02:43:23,350
Go!

3972
02:43:29,750 --> 02:43:30,850
Harsh, indeed.

3973
02:43:32,250 --> 02:43:32,790
Alright.

3974
02:43:34,170 --> 02:43:35,870
Oh, there's one of the missing toads.

3975
02:43:36,010 --> 02:43:36,290
Wait, no.

3976
02:43:36,950 --> 02:43:37,570
That's not a tourist.

3977
02:43:38,010 --> 02:43:38,330
Hey!

3978
02:43:38,650 --> 02:43:39,470
Aren't you Mario?

3979
02:43:39,950 --> 02:43:40,810
That's me!

3980
02:43:41,030 --> 02:43:41,510
Tokyo!

3981
02:43:47,410 --> 02:43:48,270
Don't worry.

3982
02:43:49,290 --> 02:43:50,670
Dad always wins.

3983
02:43:50,910 --> 02:43:52,130
The house always wins!

3984
02:43:53,970 --> 02:43:54,870
Crush him!

3985
02:43:55,690 --> 02:43:55,970
Yeah!

3986
02:43:56,770 --> 02:43:58,250
The first one's free!

3987
02:44:00,610 --> 02:44:01,250
Yeah!

3988
02:44:17,630 --> 02:44:18,830
You know what sucks?

3989
02:44:19,010 --> 02:44:20,650
Because the audience reviews were really...

3990
02:44:20,650 --> 02:44:21,210
Okay.

3991
02:44:22,290 --> 02:44:24,750
The Lilo and Stitch movie...

3992
02:44:24,750 --> 02:44:25,090
Live...

3993
02:44:25,090 --> 02:44:26,410
Okay, you guys want to feel sad?

3994
02:44:27,010 --> 02:44:30,370
The Lilo and Stitch live-action movie is a box office success.

3995
02:44:31,850 --> 02:44:33,190
It made more...

3996
02:44:33,190 --> 02:44:35,870
It doesn't take into account of inflation...

3997
02:44:35,870 --> 02:44:39,310
But it made more money than the original Lilo and Stitch movie.

3998
02:44:45,570 --> 02:44:46,930
Just so you know.

3999
02:44:47,090 --> 02:44:49,550
But they didn't take into account of inflation, though.

4000
02:44:50,190 --> 02:44:51,590
That's a good thing.

4001
02:44:52,210 --> 02:44:53,630
We're watching these.

4002
02:44:53,930 --> 02:44:55,090
Parents with children.

4003
02:44:55,510 --> 02:44:57,210
And also popcorn buckets.

4004
02:44:57,770 --> 02:44:59,050
Also, I didn't realize...

4005
02:44:59,050 --> 02:45:01,650
When the fuck did popcorn buckets became a thing?

4006
02:45:02,850 --> 02:45:03,410
Like...

4007
02:45:03,410 --> 02:45:05,030
When was that a thing?

4008
02:45:05,590 --> 02:45:06,230
Hold on!

4009
02:45:06,890 --> 02:45:07,310
Careful!

4010
02:45:07,610 --> 02:45:09,970
Some of the sound ahead is quicksand!

4011
02:45:10,710 --> 02:45:12,890
I'll suck right you into the cave below.

4012
02:45:15,430 --> 02:45:17,190
You see that tower behind me?

4013
02:45:17,850 --> 02:45:20,010
Nothing from bad vibes from it...

4014
02:45:20,010 --> 02:45:22,290
No, it has to be like a thing recently.

4015
02:45:24,810 --> 02:45:26,450
I feel like...

4016
02:45:26,450 --> 02:45:26,750
Like...

4017
02:45:26,750 --> 02:45:27,750
I meant like...

4018
02:45:27,750 --> 02:45:31,270
Like the special popcorn buckets that they do themed around movies.

4019
02:45:31,670 --> 02:45:32,550
Because I'm like...

4020
02:45:32,550 --> 02:45:33,650
When was that a thing?

4021
02:45:34,030 --> 02:45:36,370
I've never seen them before until like...

4022
02:45:36,810 --> 02:45:37,670
A couple...

4023
02:45:37,670 --> 02:45:38,870
Like a year or two ago.

4024
02:45:40,170 --> 02:45:41,990
Like usually the popcorn buckets...

4025
02:45:41,990 --> 02:45:43,210
Like the themed special ones.

4026
02:45:43,270 --> 02:45:43,950
You know what I mean?

4027
02:45:44,270 --> 02:45:46,490
Like the themed ones that match the movie.

4028
02:45:48,610 --> 02:45:51,650
Are you trying to get to Mushroom Kingdom or Metro Kingdom?

4029
02:45:52,090 --> 02:45:53,270
In that case...

4030
02:45:53,270 --> 02:45:55,090
You get through the Tostadina Tower!

4031
02:45:59,720 --> 02:46:00,440
Good luck!

4032
02:46:00,580 --> 02:46:01,640
You plan on scaling it!

4033
02:46:01,840 --> 02:46:03,780
Okay, we're gonna find the lost toads first.

4034
02:46:06,360 --> 02:46:08,240
I didn't realize they've been around forever.

4035
02:46:08,560 --> 02:46:09,800
I swear like...

4036
02:46:09,800 --> 02:46:11,120
Only recently I saw them.

4037
02:46:11,480 --> 02:46:12,900
Because of the dune one.

4038
02:46:13,100 --> 02:46:16,140
Yeah, the dune popcorn bucket was the first time I've heard about...

4039
02:46:16,140 --> 02:46:17,380
These special themed ones.

4040
02:46:20,160 --> 02:46:20,560
Absolute!

4041
02:46:20,600 --> 02:46:21,480
Thank you for the super chat.

4042
02:46:21,600 --> 02:46:22,480
Thank you, thank you.

4043
02:46:22,900 --> 02:46:28,980
I haven't trusted Ryan who made us since they froze the audience score for Rise of the Skywalker at...

4044
02:46:29,740 --> 02:46:30,140
Um...

4045
02:46:30,140 --> 02:46:31,100
Eighty-six percent.

4046
02:46:31,240 --> 02:46:31,940
Thank you for the super chat.

4047
02:46:32,020 --> 02:46:32,640
Thank you, thank you.

4048
02:46:32,740 --> 02:46:34,260
Wait, get me into that...

4049
02:46:34,260 --> 02:46:36,040
Get me in the quick stand!

4050
02:46:37,760 --> 02:46:38,160
Nice.

4051
02:46:39,180 --> 02:46:40,420
The forbidden bucket.

4052
02:46:43,500 --> 02:46:44,340
Oh, there you go.

4053
02:46:45,080 --> 02:46:45,640
Why are you?

4054
02:46:45,800 --> 02:46:46,640
Why are you here?

4055
02:46:47,200 --> 02:46:48,600
So has Rise been looking for me?

4056
02:46:49,880 --> 02:46:50,720
Thanks, Mario!

4057
02:46:51,020 --> 02:46:52,360
I'll get back right now!

4058
02:46:52,840 --> 02:46:53,240
Nice.

4059
02:46:53,360 --> 02:46:53,940
We found one.

4060
02:46:55,440 --> 02:46:57,560
I wanna make sure we find all the lost toads.

4061
02:47:03,810 --> 02:47:06,310
There's some crazy ones out there.

4062
02:47:07,910 --> 02:47:08,510
Oh, yeah.

4063
02:47:08,670 --> 02:47:10,690
By the way, you know what I found out?

4064
02:47:10,870 --> 02:47:13,010
Okay, since we're talking about Lil and Stitch movies...

4065
02:47:13,010 --> 02:47:17,390
The original animated Lil and Stitch movie was made on a budget.

4066
02:47:17,650 --> 02:47:18,350
It's hard to...

4067
02:47:18,350 --> 02:47:20,310
It's really hard to think that because like...

4068
02:47:20,310 --> 02:47:23,290
Disney was like, we need a cheap movie to animate.

4069
02:47:23,650 --> 02:47:25,890
And that's how Lil and Stitch movie came to be.

4070
02:47:26,070 --> 02:47:28,490
Because it all takes place in one location.

4071
02:47:28,690 --> 02:47:30,810
That's just nature and not in a city.

4072
02:47:31,290 --> 02:47:32,590
So they're like...

4073
02:47:32,590 --> 02:47:33,610
Oh, that's cheap to make.

4074
02:47:37,470 --> 02:47:39,570
So I thought that was like such a cool...

4075
02:47:39,570 --> 02:47:40,010
I...

4076
02:47:40,010 --> 02:47:40,110
I...

4077
02:47:40,110 --> 02:47:40,650
It doesn't even...

4078
02:47:40,650 --> 02:47:41,310
I was like...

4079
02:47:41,310 --> 02:47:42,410
That was cheap?

4080
02:47:44,450 --> 02:47:46,430
That is safe for Lion King too.

4081
02:47:47,610 --> 02:47:52,690
In Lion King, they reused a lot of assets from older animated films.

4082
02:47:52,950 --> 02:47:53,690
Because they were like...

4083
02:47:53,690 --> 02:47:54,570
Man, we can't...

4084
02:47:54,570 --> 02:47:56,530
We can't keep making expensive animated movies.

4085
02:47:56,590 --> 02:47:57,490
We gotta make something cheap.

4086
02:47:57,770 --> 02:47:59,890
So then they made Lion King and Lil and Stitch.

4087
02:48:02,870 --> 02:48:04,570
I thought that was like a fun fact.

4088
02:48:07,350 --> 02:48:08,570
We need this.

4089
02:48:14,260 --> 02:48:17,020
The missing link in the K in the Goon K.

4090
02:48:21,880 --> 02:48:23,220
The missing link.

4091
02:48:28,020 --> 02:48:29,380
Oh, thank you for the super chat.

4092
02:48:29,480 --> 02:48:30,400
Thank you, thank you.

4093
02:48:30,620 --> 02:48:33,100
I blame the Dune popcorn bucket.

4094
02:48:33,460 --> 02:48:35,380
Also Pop put on the maid outfit.

4095
02:48:35,600 --> 02:48:36,540
Thank you for the super chat.

4096
02:48:36,640 --> 02:48:37,320
Thank you, thank you.

4097
02:48:37,440 --> 02:48:38,820
Benji, thank you for the super chat.

4098
02:48:38,920 --> 02:48:39,720
Thank you, thank you.

4099
02:48:40,120 --> 02:48:42,580
I've heard the live action remake has won the highest opening...

4100
02:48:42,580 --> 02:48:43,200
Yeah, it did.

4101
02:48:43,400 --> 02:48:46,560
The Lil and Stitch live action has the highest opening memorial.

4102
02:48:46,560 --> 02:48:52,200
Memorial Day weekend box office... Like, what was the competition?

4103
02:48:53,920 --> 02:48:57,980
I'm like thinking, what was the competition they have?

4104
02:48:58,300 --> 02:48:59,480
There's no way.

4105
02:48:59,860 --> 02:49:02,260
They must have had zero competition.

4106
02:49:05,340 --> 02:49:05,880
Nothing.

4107
02:49:06,060 --> 02:49:09,420
Like, what else was there to watch other than Leo and Stitch?

4108
02:49:10,420 --> 02:49:13,380
I guess there was nothing for the children, I guess.

4109
02:49:13,480 --> 02:49:15,200
You know, like Memorial Day for the kids?

4110
02:49:16,560 --> 02:49:19,260
Yeah, I mean, like, you will not... Oh, there it is!

4111
02:49:19,580 --> 02:49:20,020
Ironcliff!

4112
02:49:20,360 --> 02:49:24,080
You won't take your children to watch Mission Impossible.

4113
02:49:32,900 --> 02:49:38,620
Yeah, but the How to Train Your Dragon live action is literally like... Like, they showed like trailers and clips of it.

4114
02:49:38,760 --> 02:49:44,320
And it looked like... It looked like just a recreation of the animated movie, but worse.

4115
02:49:49,150 --> 02:49:51,370
Oh my god, I'm scared of Disney adults.

4116
02:49:52,110 --> 02:49:53,330
I'm not a Disney adult.

4117
02:49:53,330 --> 02:50:00,070
I like... I like Disney songs, but I'm like... I'm not a Disney adult, but like, I'm a little scared of them.

4118
02:50:00,790 --> 02:50:08,590
You know, you heard about the Disney... The VIP Disney Club, where like, some people waited eight plus years...

4119
02:50:08,590 --> 02:50:11,330
To... On the waiting list... To like...

4120
02:50:12,970 --> 02:50:13,530
Um...

4121
02:50:13,530 --> 02:50:19,070
On the waiting list to just be like, part of the exclusive Disney VIP club.

4122
02:50:20,370 --> 02:50:21,610
What is that?

4123
02:50:21,830 --> 02:50:22,070
What is that?

4124
02:50:22,070 --> 02:50:24,790
It's basically... Oh my god, he's so strong!

4125
02:50:27,510 --> 02:50:28,230
Like...

4126
02:50:28,230 --> 02:50:28,950
What?

4127
02:50:29,190 --> 02:50:29,450
Okay.

4128
02:50:30,070 --> 02:50:30,830
Level 34.

4129
02:50:31,510 --> 02:50:32,950
Maybe I'll just use stick bug.

4130
02:50:33,610 --> 02:50:34,390
Club 32.

4131
02:50:34,850 --> 02:50:37,550
So there's this Disney club called Club 32.

4132
02:50:39,570 --> 02:50:40,830
And like...

4133
02:50:40,830 --> 02:50:44,510
Each year, you have to pay a very expensive membership.

4134
02:50:45,370 --> 02:50:46,950
Oh my god, you're gonna die.

4135
02:50:49,890 --> 02:50:51,550
You have to pay for like...

4136
02:50:52,850 --> 02:50:53,330
A...

4137
02:50:53,330 --> 02:50:53,590
Very...

4138
02:50:53,590 --> 02:50:54,110
Oh, 33.

4139
02:50:54,450 --> 02:50:54,570
Sorry.

4140
02:50:54,650 --> 02:50:55,250
Club 33.

4141
02:50:55,830 --> 02:51:01,770
And each year, you have to pay a very, very expensive membership to be in the club.

4142
02:51:01,990 --> 02:51:03,730
But there's also a 10...

4143
02:51:03,730 --> 02:51:08,950
I think it was like, eight plus year plus waiting list to even be part of the...

4144
02:51:09,290 --> 02:51:10,030
Uh...

4145
02:51:10,030 --> 02:51:10,790
Part of the club.

4146
02:51:11,190 --> 02:51:15,010
And yet to be referred to by other members in Club 33.

4147
02:51:16,290 --> 02:51:17,230
And like...

4148
02:51:17,230 --> 02:51:18,190
I killed him.

4149
02:51:18,770 --> 02:51:19,170
I...

4150
02:51:20,530 --> 02:51:21,210
Fuck!

4151
02:51:21,970 --> 02:51:22,650
No!

4152
02:51:26,740 --> 02:51:27,420
I...

4153
02:51:27,420 --> 02:51:28,480
I don't know!

4154
02:51:28,480 --> 02:51:29,180
I...

4155
02:51:29,180 --> 02:51:32,020
I was trying to find anything that could do a little damage!

4156
02:51:32,800 --> 02:51:33,240
I...

4157
02:51:36,700 --> 02:51:38,280
Oh, and I fell down again.

4158
02:51:39,280 --> 02:51:40,640
I fell down again.

4159
02:51:42,860 --> 02:51:45,460
Okay, and they would have like, exclusive merch there.

4160
02:51:45,600 --> 02:51:46,120
And you could like...

4161
02:51:46,120 --> 02:51:46,880
Oh my gosh.

4162
02:51:46,980 --> 02:51:48,420
I like, rattled up a little bit.

4163
02:51:50,160 --> 02:51:52,080
But they can kick you out at any moment.

4164
02:51:56,510 --> 02:51:57,570
I didn't know.

4165
02:51:57,870 --> 02:51:58,690
I didn't...

4166
02:51:58,690 --> 02:52:00,710
Oh my god, I went through the same...

4167
02:52:04,130 --> 02:52:05,650
I can't help it!

4168
02:52:05,950 --> 02:52:07,930
Wait, is there any like, mons in this cave?

4169
02:52:08,530 --> 02:52:10,090
Oh no, this cave is...

4170
02:52:10,090 --> 02:52:11,070
Is like, free.

4171
02:52:11,590 --> 02:52:12,030
I...

4172
02:52:12,030 --> 02:52:13,730
I just went through the same hole.

4173
02:52:13,990 --> 02:52:15,770
The same fucking hole.

4174
02:52:18,230 --> 02:52:19,190
What are the benefits?

4175
02:52:19,430 --> 02:52:20,270
Okay, give me a sec.

4176
02:52:20,370 --> 02:52:21,550
Let me like, run away.

4177
02:52:21,710 --> 02:52:22,670
And I'll show you...

4178
02:52:22,670 --> 02:52:23,930
I'll explain Club 33.

4179
02:52:24,290 --> 02:52:26,570
I know you guys really wanna know what's in Club 33.

4180
02:52:27,050 --> 02:52:27,390
Now.

4181
02:52:29,190 --> 02:52:29,630
Alright.

4182
02:52:31,470 --> 02:52:32,070
Alright.

4183
02:52:32,850 --> 02:52:33,830
So, Club 33.

4184
02:52:33,850 --> 02:52:35,590
There's like, lounges everywhere.

4185
02:52:35,950 --> 02:52:37,710
You can get like, tickets and stuff.

4186
02:52:37,910 --> 02:52:38,070
Okay.

4187
02:52:38,530 --> 02:52:39,430
Club 33.

4188
02:52:41,390 --> 02:52:41,990
What's...

4189
02:52:41,990 --> 02:52:43,370
What do you get?

4190
02:52:44,510 --> 02:52:46,450
What do you get in Club...

4191
02:52:46,790 --> 02:52:47,870
How much do...

4192
02:52:47,870 --> 02:52:48,330
Alright.

4193
02:52:48,330 --> 02:52:49,250
Okay.

4194
02:52:49,250 --> 02:52:51,610
So, the initiation fee is...

4195
02:52:51,610 --> 02:52:52,210
Fifty...

4196
02:52:52,210 --> 02:52:52,990
Okay.

4197
02:52:53,990 --> 02:52:55,090
The initiation fee...

4198
02:52:55,090 --> 02:52:56,470
Can be as high as...

4199
02:52:56,470 --> 02:52:57,210
Fifteen...

4200
02:52:57,210 --> 02:52:58,390
Thousand...

4201
02:52:58,390 --> 02:52:58,910
Dollars.

4202
02:52:59,310 --> 02:53:00,850
And membership fee...

4203
02:53:00,970 --> 02:53:01,510
Is...

4204
02:53:01,510 --> 02:53:02,810
Fifteen...

4205
02:53:02,810 --> 02:53:03,350
Thousand...

4206
02:53:03,850 --> 02:53:04,290
Dollars?

4207
02:53:04,290 --> 02:53:05,790
Holy...

4208
02:53:05,790 --> 02:53:06,370
Holy...

4209
02:53:06,370 --> 02:53:06,530
Fuck.

4210
02:53:07,590 --> 02:53:08,430
Jesus.

4211
02:53:08,890 --> 02:53:09,170
Okay.

4212
02:53:09,410 --> 02:53:10,230
I didn't know...

4213
02:53:11,890 --> 02:53:13,970
I didn't even know that.

4214
02:53:15,390 --> 02:53:16,310
Okay.

4215
02:53:16,330 --> 02:53:17,090
That's a lot.

4216
02:53:18,930 --> 02:53:21,170
Disney adults are scary.

4217
02:53:21,830 --> 02:53:22,670
Disney...

4218
02:53:22,670 --> 02:53:25,530
Disney adults are really scary.

4219
02:53:25,530 --> 02:53:26,550
Alright.

4220
02:53:28,250 --> 02:53:29,350
It's a most...

4221
02:53:29,350 --> 02:53:32,430
It's an exclusive and mysterious members only club.

4222
02:53:32,790 --> 02:53:33,970
Don't talk about it.

4223
02:53:34,150 --> 02:53:35,090
It stays low with...

4224
02:53:35,090 --> 02:53:35,290
Oh yeah.

4225
02:53:35,330 --> 02:53:36,650
You have to have a dress code too.

4226
02:53:37,850 --> 02:53:38,450
Um...

4227
02:53:38,450 --> 02:53:39,150
Fifteen as in...

4228
02:53:39,150 --> 02:53:39,950
One five...

4229
02:53:39,950 --> 02:53:40,930
Three zero.

4230
02:53:44,450 --> 02:53:46,270
Oh my god.

4231
02:53:47,410 --> 02:53:49,150
What the fuck?

4232
02:53:53,320 --> 02:53:53,670
Jesus.

4233
02:53:53,670 --> 02:53:54,350
What the...

4234
02:53:54,350 --> 02:53:55,670
I did not realize...

4235
02:53:56,190 --> 02:53:58,270
I did not realize...

4236
02:53:58,270 --> 02:53:59,070
It was...

4237
02:53:59,070 --> 02:54:00,690
That expensive.

4238
02:54:01,470 --> 02:54:01,850
Holy...

4239
02:54:02,230 --> 02:54:02,790
Shit.

4240
02:54:03,590 --> 02:54:03,850
Yeah.

4241
02:54:04,070 --> 02:54:04,910
You should get...

4242
02:54:04,910 --> 02:54:06,750
Club 33 is like...

4243
02:54:06,750 --> 02:54:07,310
Crazy.

4244
02:54:07,710 --> 02:54:08,990
A crazy experience.

4245
02:54:09,610 --> 02:54:10,230
That's why I'm like...

4246
02:54:10,230 --> 02:54:11,670
I'm afraid of Disney adults.

4247
02:54:15,230 --> 02:54:17,250
Don't go through that hole again.

4248
02:54:19,110 --> 02:54:19,490
Yeah.

4249
02:54:19,490 --> 02:54:22,630
There's like a lounge and exclusive merch you can buy...

4250
02:54:22,630 --> 02:54:23,570
And everything.

4251
02:54:28,250 --> 02:54:29,190
Apparently like...

4252
02:54:29,190 --> 02:54:31,010
A lot of celebrities are in Club 33.

4253
02:54:33,870 --> 02:54:35,530
I don't like this one bit.

4254
02:54:35,910 --> 02:54:36,530
What's that?

4255
02:54:36,870 --> 02:54:38,870
Toadra is looking for me back into...

4256
02:54:38,870 --> 02:54:39,350
Therion?

4257
02:54:40,170 --> 02:54:40,650
Thanks.

4258
02:54:40,890 --> 02:54:42,590
I was a little scared to leave on my own.

4259
02:54:43,230 --> 02:54:43,890
Are you here?

4260
02:54:44,110 --> 02:54:45,150
I think I can do it.

4261
02:54:45,550 --> 02:54:45,930
Nice.

4262
02:54:46,050 --> 02:54:46,410
We did it.

4263
02:54:47,490 --> 02:54:47,990
Yeah.

4264
02:54:48,130 --> 02:54:49,550
Pay money to spend more money.

4265
02:54:52,590 --> 02:54:53,810
Do I need that item?

4266
02:54:54,050 --> 02:54:55,070
I feel like I don't.

4267
02:54:55,490 --> 02:54:56,430
I saved all...

4268
02:54:56,430 --> 02:54:57,410
I did it!

4269
02:54:57,470 --> 02:54:58,070
I'm a hero!

4270
02:54:58,830 --> 02:55:00,830
I saved all the toads!

4271
02:55:01,690 --> 02:55:02,510
Oh nice.

4272
02:55:02,830 --> 02:55:03,810
There's Iron Cleft again.

4273
02:55:04,730 --> 02:55:04,910
Okay.

4274
02:55:04,910 --> 02:55:06,130
This time I won't kill him.

4275
02:55:08,470 --> 02:55:11,030
Yeah but regular people can get in too.

4276
02:55:11,350 --> 02:55:12,210
Quote on quote regular.

4277
02:55:13,990 --> 02:55:14,610
There's...

4278
02:55:14,610 --> 02:55:17,430
I only knew about Club 33 because like...

4279
02:55:17,430 --> 02:55:20,490
A couple got kicked out of Club 33.

4280
02:55:20,830 --> 02:55:26,490
And they spent all their money trying to sue Disney to allow them back into Club 33.

4281
02:55:26,490 --> 02:55:28,410
And then because like...

4282
02:55:28,410 --> 02:55:30,150
They couldn't get back into Club 33.

4283
02:55:30,610 --> 02:55:31,710
The reason why...

4284
02:55:31,710 --> 02:55:34,910
They got like kicked out was because apparently the husband...

4285
02:55:34,910 --> 02:55:38,250
Seemed like he was like intoxicated in public at Disneyland.

4286
02:55:38,790 --> 02:55:40,470
So then they got kicked out because of that.

4287
02:55:40,730 --> 02:55:42,930
And then because they tried to sue...

4288
02:55:43,610 --> 02:55:44,130
Disneyland...

4289
02:55:44,130 --> 02:55:44,870
To like...

4290
02:55:44,870 --> 02:55:46,030
To like make them...

4291
02:55:46,030 --> 02:55:47,590
Get them back into Club 33.

4292
02:55:48,190 --> 02:55:49,110
That like...

4293
02:55:49,110 --> 02:55:51,330
After they lost the case...

4294
02:55:51,330 --> 02:55:51,810
Um...

4295
02:55:51,810 --> 02:55:52,950
They revealed everything.

4296
02:55:52,950 --> 02:55:54,930
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

4297
02:55:55,030 --> 02:55:57,010
They whistle blown Club 33.

4298
02:55:57,430 --> 02:55:59,450
And like revealed everything about it.

4299
02:56:01,730 --> 02:56:03,010
But it's crazy.

4300
02:56:03,410 --> 02:56:05,310
They sued Disney to try to...

4301
02:56:05,310 --> 02:56:07,470
Get back into Club 33.

4302
02:56:07,970 --> 02:56:09,290
I feel like that's crazy.

4303
02:56:09,510 --> 02:56:10,350
The crazy part.

4304
02:56:10,630 --> 02:56:11,510
And then they were like...

4305
02:56:11,510 --> 02:56:13,010
I didn't want to talk about this.

4306
02:56:13,110 --> 02:56:15,130
Like I really wanted to get back into Club 33.

4307
02:56:15,310 --> 02:56:16,430
But they made us no choice.

4308
02:56:16,530 --> 02:56:17,630
So we're revealing everything.

4309
02:56:18,390 --> 02:56:20,850
There's not a secret society about it anymore.

4310
02:56:21,370 --> 02:56:22,430
Ha ha ha ha ha.

4311
02:56:24,430 --> 02:56:25,350
I feel like I am.

4312
02:56:25,410 --> 02:56:26,270
Thank you for the super chat.

4313
02:56:26,430 --> 02:56:26,670
Thank you.

4314
02:56:26,850 --> 02:56:27,330
Thank you.

4315
02:56:28,270 --> 02:56:28,670
Um...

4316
02:56:28,670 --> 02:56:30,250
An ad that works staff in Disney one.

4317
02:56:30,390 --> 02:56:32,650
She mentioned Disney dolls were always the hardest to work with.

4318
02:56:34,910 --> 02:56:35,310
Um...

4319
02:56:35,310 --> 02:56:36,090
Does Disney have any...

4320
02:56:36,090 --> 02:56:36,570
Yeah, they know.

4321
02:56:36,650 --> 02:56:37,390
They run the club.

4322
02:56:37,650 --> 02:56:38,970
They actually run the club.

4323
02:56:40,850 --> 02:56:42,850
A bald cleft with spikes for a while.

4324
02:56:43,110 --> 02:56:45,870
Only two members of this species had ever been countered.

4325
02:56:45,870 --> 02:56:49,010
They used their hard iron coding to fight for sport.

4326
02:56:50,390 --> 02:56:51,570
Wait only...

4327
02:56:51,570 --> 02:56:52,290
For a while?

4328
02:56:52,450 --> 02:56:53,290
Only two members?

4329
02:56:53,470 --> 02:56:54,790
I like killed so many.

4330
02:56:55,290 --> 02:56:58,810
There's a reason why there's only two left of this species.

4331
02:56:58,810 --> 02:56:59,750
I...

4332
02:56:59,750 --> 02:57:01,770
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

4333
02:57:03,070 --> 02:57:03,290
I...

4334
02:57:03,290 --> 02:57:05,690
The scientists were only able to document two.

4335
02:57:05,970 --> 02:57:07,750
Because I've killed the others.

4336
02:57:09,430 --> 02:57:10,270
Ha ha ha.

4337
02:57:11,550 --> 02:57:12,010
Ha ha ha.

4338
02:57:12,210 --> 02:57:17,690
Ha ha ha.

4339
02:57:17,690 --> 02:57:19,870
You're the one I left alive.

4340
02:57:24,750 --> 02:57:25,270
Okay.

4341
02:57:32,240 --> 02:57:35,080
I left you alive so you can tell the tale.

4342
02:57:39,550 --> 02:57:41,550
I wonder what's up with this tower.

4343
02:57:41,810 --> 02:57:44,950
I can't understand a single thing on these weird rocks.

4344
02:57:45,710 --> 02:57:46,510
Oh, what?

4345
02:57:46,650 --> 02:57:47,630
The secret tower?

4346
02:57:48,290 --> 02:57:51,510
I was told that I could get to Metro Kingdom through this tower.

4347
02:57:51,750 --> 02:57:53,070
There's no way to the top.

4348
02:57:53,270 --> 02:57:53,930
What a scam.

4349
02:57:54,970 --> 02:57:56,990
This rock is quite mysterious.

4350
02:57:57,610 --> 02:57:59,470
I see it has special healing properties.

4351
02:57:59,850 --> 02:58:02,730
Making this a risk stop of sorts for travelers.

4352
02:58:03,130 --> 02:58:03,550
Oh, okay.

4353
02:58:03,690 --> 02:58:04,050
That's good.

4354
02:58:07,750 --> 02:58:08,310
Yeah.

4355
02:58:09,770 --> 02:58:14,510
I'm sorry, but it seems the path to Metro Kingdom hasn't closed off by Kamek.

4356
02:58:14,890 --> 02:58:16,630
If only there's something we could do.

4357
02:58:17,050 --> 02:58:18,330
Oh, there's nothing I could do?

4358
02:58:18,650 --> 02:58:19,930
Yup, no witnesses.

4359
02:58:21,370 --> 02:58:24,270
And yeah, thank you for giving us a super chat.

4360
02:58:24,530 --> 02:58:24,890
Thank you.

4361
02:58:25,070 --> 02:58:25,550
Thank you.

4362
02:58:25,890 --> 02:58:26,190
Yup.

4363
02:58:26,570 --> 02:58:27,310
You're here forever.

4364
02:58:27,910 --> 02:58:28,290
Uh-huh.

4365
02:58:29,330 --> 02:58:30,030
Uh-huh.

4366
02:58:30,110 --> 02:58:30,930
You're here forever.

4367
02:58:31,310 --> 02:58:32,230
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

4368
02:58:32,810 --> 02:58:33,590
Goofy dog.

4369
02:58:34,230 --> 02:58:35,310
Ha-ha-ha.

4370
02:58:35,470 --> 02:58:36,150
What was that?

4371
02:58:36,270 --> 02:58:37,010
What was that?

4372
02:58:37,150 --> 02:58:39,490
Mickey and Goofy in Vietnam video?

4373
02:58:40,110 --> 02:58:40,330
Ha-ha.

4374
02:58:40,650 --> 02:58:42,950
Gosh, Mickey, we gotta report this.

4375
02:58:43,510 --> 02:58:43,610
Ha-ha.

4376
02:58:43,610 --> 02:58:44,250
Oh, gosh.

4377
02:58:45,730 --> 02:58:46,370
Ha-ha.

4378
02:58:47,830 --> 02:58:48,650
Ha-ha.

4379
02:58:48,650 --> 02:58:49,110
Ha-ha-ha.

4380
02:58:49,470 --> 02:58:52,550
Ha-ha-ha.

4381
02:58:53,490 --> 02:58:54,090
Yeah.

4382
02:58:57,110 --> 02:58:57,410
Oh.

4383
02:58:57,790 --> 02:58:58,250
Uh-huh.

4384
02:58:58,710 --> 02:58:59,070
Goofy.

4385
02:58:59,250 --> 02:59:00,250
I thought you were different?

4386
02:59:00,710 --> 02:59:01,450
Ha-ha-ha.

4387
02:59:02,070 --> 02:59:02,670
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

4388
02:59:02,670 --> 02:59:03,510
Take the shot, Mickey.

4389
02:59:04,130 --> 02:59:04,910
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

4390
02:59:05,890 --> 02:59:06,290
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

4391
02:59:06,290 --> 02:59:06,950
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

4392
02:59:06,950 --> 02:59:07,070
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

4393
02:59:07,510 --> 02:59:11,710
The- leverage for those who have never seen that video..

4394
02:59:11,710 --> 02:59:12,570
I think you can.

4395
02:59:12,790 --> 02:59:15,390
It's called Mickey and Goofy in Vietnam.

4396
02:59:18,610 --> 02:59:20,690
It's an animation.

4397
02:59:24,790 --> 02:59:27,810
It's a classic, it's a classic.

4398
02:59:36,550 --> 02:59:38,790
Obviously, they're a lot better.

4399
02:59:39,150 --> 02:59:43,070
They sound more like Goofy and Mickey than me, obviously.

4400
02:59:45,390 --> 02:59:47,590
Is that not all of them?!

4401
02:59:47,590 --> 02:59:48,890
I'm not... What?

4402
02:59:49,090 --> 02:59:50,630
Who else is missing?

4403
02:59:55,410 --> 02:59:56,670
What are you talking about?

4404
02:59:56,790 --> 02:59:59,630
Look up Goofy and Mickey in Vietnam.

4405
02:59:59,990 --> 03:00:02,150
And then you'll know what I'm talking about.

4406
03:00:02,770 --> 03:00:05,050
How many more toes am I missing?

4407
03:00:09,390 --> 03:00:10,670
Oh my god.

4408
03:00:12,340 --> 03:00:14,250
I thought I found all of them.

4409
03:00:17,420 --> 03:00:18,840
I hate this area.

4410
03:00:19,780 --> 03:00:20,680
Go to the tower?

4411
03:00:20,980 --> 03:00:22,000
I was in the tower.

4412
03:00:22,840 --> 03:00:24,780
They're like, I don't know what to do.

4413
03:00:24,980 --> 03:00:26,940
And I was like, I don't know what to do either.

4414
03:00:40,020 --> 03:00:42,140
There's some crazy... I saw some shorts.

4415
03:00:42,500 --> 03:00:44,180
Some, um, Disney shorts.

4416
03:00:44,500 --> 03:00:49,020
Of, like, what it was like to be, like, an ex-Disney princess.

4417
03:00:49,680 --> 03:00:52,680
Um, an ex-Disney princess for Disneyland.

4418
03:00:53,220 --> 03:00:56,360
And, like, some of the rules were fucking crazy.

4419
03:00:59,080 --> 03:01:01,080
Oh, wait, there were rocks?!

4420
03:01:02,120 --> 03:01:04,120
Oh my god, wait, there is!

4421
03:01:04,580 --> 03:01:05,640
I can't read!

4422
03:01:10,350 --> 03:01:11,690
Is this lost?

4423
03:01:17,570 --> 03:01:18,470
Is this...

4424
03:01:18,470 --> 03:01:19,890
What am I reading?

4425
03:01:23,030 --> 03:01:23,630
Braille?

4426
03:01:23,890 --> 03:01:25,310
Am I reading lost?

4427
03:01:31,400 --> 03:01:33,140
One of them has to be lost.

4428
03:01:38,000 --> 03:01:38,560
Wait...

4429
03:01:40,440 --> 03:01:41,740
Change rocks, right?

4430
03:01:42,000 --> 03:01:42,680
I knew...

4431
03:01:42,680 --> 03:01:43,880
Wait, that was lost!

4432
03:01:45,620 --> 03:01:46,680
Oh my god!

4433
03:01:47,100 --> 03:01:48,800
Oh, I wrote this game.

4434
03:01:49,320 --> 03:01:49,760
I...

4435
03:01:51,300 --> 03:01:52,460
Change rocks, right?

4436
03:01:52,720 --> 03:01:54,460
Don't worry if you can't solve the riddle.

4437
03:01:54,460 --> 03:01:55,080
Mario!

4438
03:01:55,080 --> 03:01:57,620
The ancient Tostarian language has been lost for years.

4439
03:01:57,940 --> 03:02:01,580
I caught up an archaeologist to help us out with the tower.

4440
03:02:01,780 --> 03:02:03,240
And they should be here any moment.

4441
03:02:03,900 --> 03:02:04,760
I should be the...

4442
03:02:04,760 --> 03:02:05,000
No!

4443
03:02:05,460 --> 03:02:05,800
No!

4444
03:02:07,020 --> 03:02:07,500
No!

4445
03:02:10,060 --> 03:02:11,260
Oh my god.

4446
03:02:11,480 --> 03:02:12,120
I knew it.

4447
03:02:12,240 --> 03:02:12,760
I knew it.

4448
03:02:12,800 --> 03:02:13,660
I saw those Braille.

4449
03:02:13,780 --> 03:02:15,000
I knew Lost was in here.

4450
03:02:15,580 --> 03:02:16,040
Mario!

4451
03:02:16,300 --> 03:02:17,040
You're here too?

4452
03:02:17,460 --> 03:02:18,980
You know the captain, Mario?

4453
03:02:19,420 --> 03:02:20,680
Of course we know each other!

4454
03:02:20,960 --> 03:02:22,480
We just went through the entire jungle!

4455
03:02:24,120 --> 03:02:26,500
That's what had you away for so long, eh?

4456
03:02:26,940 --> 03:02:27,740
Well, never mind!

4457
03:02:28,340 --> 03:02:29,880
We got a puzzle that needs solving!

4458
03:02:30,620 --> 03:02:30,960
Right!

4459
03:02:31,180 --> 03:02:32,340
The Tostarian rocks!

4460
03:02:32,640 --> 03:02:32,900
Right?

4461
03:02:33,300 --> 03:02:34,480
This one's easy.

4462
03:02:34,640 --> 03:02:34,920
No!

4463
03:02:35,480 --> 03:02:35,880
No!

4464
03:02:37,600 --> 03:02:38,200
No!

4465
03:02:40,520 --> 03:02:42,080
Why is he back?

4466
03:02:46,520 --> 03:02:49,720
All I gotta do is touch all rocks and go to the center one!

4467
03:02:50,260 --> 03:02:50,360
Huh?

4468
03:02:50,860 --> 03:02:54,260
Now all I gotta do is touch this one and the way should be open!

4469
03:02:56,400 --> 03:02:57,140
Oh nice.

4470
03:02:57,580 --> 03:02:57,860
Whoa!

4471
03:02:58,220 --> 03:02:59,560
Where did that ladder come from?

4472
03:03:00,120 --> 03:03:00,360
Ha!

4473
03:03:00,600 --> 03:03:01,280
I knew it!

4474
03:03:01,720 --> 03:03:03,620
That'll lead you right to the top of the tower!

4475
03:03:04,040 --> 03:03:05,200
You want me to come with you?

4476
03:03:05,300 --> 03:03:05,720
Oh no!

4477
03:03:06,180 --> 03:03:06,320
No!

4478
03:03:07,080 --> 03:03:07,140
No!

4479
03:03:07,920 --> 03:03:09,480
I'll be heading back into the desert!

4480
03:03:09,900 --> 03:03:12,500
Besides, you shouldn't really rely on me too much!

4481
03:03:12,900 --> 03:03:16,500
I'm sure we'll get a chance to work together sometime in the future!

4482
03:03:17,060 --> 03:03:18,640
But right now, let's go bye once more!

4483
03:03:18,800 --> 03:03:19,260
Oh thank god!

4484
03:03:19,780 --> 03:03:20,200
Good god!

4485
03:03:20,660 --> 03:03:21,920
Better not waste any time!

4486
03:03:22,420 --> 03:03:24,200
Come is up there and needs to be stopped!

4487
03:03:24,200 --> 03:03:24,280
What?

4488
03:03:24,780 --> 03:03:25,340
Okay.

4489
03:03:25,860 --> 03:03:26,240
Thank god.

4490
03:03:26,500 --> 03:03:27,200
Was I lost?

4491
03:03:28,540 --> 03:03:29,520
Or was lost?

4492
03:03:32,600 --> 03:03:33,720
Oh there it is!

4493
03:03:36,180 --> 03:03:37,300
There it is!

4494
03:03:37,640 --> 03:03:38,580
Yeah, that's lost!

4495
03:03:42,700 --> 03:03:43,720
I knew it!

4496
03:03:43,820 --> 03:03:44,420
I knew it!

4497
03:03:44,500 --> 03:03:46,900
I can smell lost a mile away!

4498
03:03:52,800 --> 03:03:54,040
It's so easy!

4499
03:03:57,040 --> 03:03:58,080
Any time!

4500
03:03:58,400 --> 03:03:58,920
Any time!

4501
03:03:59,400 --> 03:04:00,060
Any time!

4502
03:04:00,260 --> 03:04:01,140
There's stuff like that!

4503
03:04:01,560 --> 03:04:03,160
Lost will always be there!

4504
03:04:04,140 --> 03:04:05,400
What is lost?

4505
03:04:06,180 --> 03:04:06,660
Lost?

4506
03:04:07,000 --> 03:04:14,120
L-O-S-S It's an infamous webcomic back then where it was originally made to be like...

4507
03:04:14,120 --> 03:04:14,420
Haha!

4508
03:04:14,720 --> 03:04:15,380
I'm a nerd!

4509
03:04:15,700 --> 03:04:17,900
I make relatable nerd comics!

4510
03:04:18,440 --> 03:04:19,660
And then like...

4511
03:04:20,580 --> 03:04:22,280
And then all of a sudden...

4512
03:04:22,280 --> 03:04:25,320
He decided to make it like...

4513
03:04:25,320 --> 03:04:25,520
Serious!

4514
03:04:25,940 --> 03:04:27,600
And then like...

4515
03:04:27,600 --> 03:04:29,160
He got his girlfriend pregnant!

4516
03:04:29,600 --> 03:04:31,840
And he lo- And she lost a baby!

4517
03:04:32,400 --> 03:04:33,080
And...

4518
03:04:33,080 --> 03:04:34,600
But then like...

4519
03:04:34,600 --> 03:04:35,200
The...

4520
03:04:35,200 --> 03:04:37,660
The whole webcomic before then...

4521
03:04:38,360 --> 03:04:39,160
Was...

4522
03:04:39,160 --> 03:04:39,560
Haha!

4523
03:04:40,260 --> 03:04:42,400
Funny nerd relatable shit!

4524
03:04:43,200 --> 03:04:43,880
Like...

4525
03:04:44,860 --> 03:04:46,760
So everyone was like...

4526
03:04:48,120 --> 03:04:48,800
Why...

4527
03:04:48,800 --> 03:04:49,900
Why...

4528
03:04:49,900 --> 03:04:51,320
Why was there...

4529
03:04:52,660 --> 03:04:53,340
Didn't...

4530
03:04:53,340 --> 03:04:54,120
There was no joke!

4531
03:04:54,300 --> 03:04:55,260
There was no joke!

4532
03:04:55,600 --> 03:04:56,720
It was just...

4533
03:04:56,720 --> 03:04:58,700
She had a miscarriage!

4534
03:04:58,700 --> 03:04:58,940
Like...

4535
03:04:58,940 --> 03:05:00,760
And then everyone was...

4536
03:05:00,760 --> 03:05:02,180
And then it just...

4537
03:05:02,180 --> 03:05:02,700
Every...

4538
03:05:02,700 --> 03:05:04,160
It just became lost!

4539
03:05:04,440 --> 03:05:04,860
Haha!

4540
03:05:08,980 --> 03:05:10,360
It was so...

4541
03:05:10,360 --> 03:05:10,840
I don't know...

4542
03:05:10,840 --> 03:05:11,900
I forgot this guy...

4543
03:05:11,900 --> 03:05:12,880
It does not have...

4544
03:05:12,880 --> 03:05:15,220
So I was so busy talking about lost...

4545
03:05:15,220 --> 03:05:15,860
I didn't...

4546
03:05:15,860 --> 03:05:16,600
Oh my god!

4547
03:05:16,920 --> 03:05:17,940
What worked?

4548
03:05:18,100 --> 03:05:18,220
I...

4549
03:05:18,560 --> 03:05:18,900
Okay...

4550
03:05:18,900 --> 03:05:19,340
Okay...

4551
03:05:19,340 --> 03:05:19,940
Let me...

4552
03:05:19,940 --> 03:05:20,480
Bye!

4553
03:05:20,980 --> 03:05:21,580
Haha!

4554
03:05:25,260 --> 03:05:25,940
Okay...

4555
03:05:25,940 --> 03:05:26,620
Something worked!

4556
03:05:28,100 --> 03:05:28,780
Something...

4557
03:05:28,780 --> 03:05:29,540
Something worked!

4558
03:05:33,940 --> 03:05:34,660
Oh...

4559
03:05:34,660 --> 03:05:35,020
Jesus!

4560
03:05:35,720 --> 03:05:36,420
But...

4561
03:05:36,420 --> 03:05:36,960
Jesus!

4562
03:05:37,940 --> 03:05:39,560
Thank you for the super chat!

4563
03:05:39,680 --> 03:05:39,920
Thank you!

4564
03:05:40,120 --> 03:05:40,600
Thank you!

4565
03:05:44,760 --> 03:05:45,480
Okay...

4566
03:05:47,100 --> 03:05:47,820
Yeah...

4567
03:05:47,820 --> 03:05:48,280
Lost...

4568
03:05:48,280 --> 03:05:49,040
Is like...

4569
03:05:49,040 --> 03:05:49,280
The...

4570
03:05:49,280 --> 03:05:50,700
The name of the comic book...

4571
03:05:50,700 --> 03:05:51,900
Comic series itself!

4572
03:05:53,420 --> 03:05:54,140
Yay!

4573
03:05:56,420 --> 03:05:57,140
Alright...

4574
03:05:57,140 --> 03:05:58,580
Who wants to be it?

4575
03:05:58,940 --> 03:05:59,480
Chincho!

4576
03:06:01,380 --> 03:06:04,060
A mummy that charges at you with adorable Bannon!

4577
03:06:04,580 --> 03:06:07,100
Scientists still don't know what that creature was!

4578
03:06:07,280 --> 03:06:08,520
It has the cutest smile!

4579
03:06:08,720 --> 03:06:10,200
But I'll never show you!

4580
03:06:10,520 --> 03:06:11,960
Oh, it's like a little ghost!

4581
03:06:14,240 --> 03:06:14,780
Alright...

4582
03:06:14,780 --> 03:06:15,360
You know what?

4583
03:06:16,080 --> 03:06:16,920
Put in...

4584
03:06:16,920 --> 03:06:17,940
I'll give it to you!

4585
03:06:20,340 --> 03:06:20,880
Who...

4586
03:06:23,700 --> 03:06:24,240
Who...

4587
03:06:24,240 --> 03:06:25,240
We're in...

4588
03:06:26,220 --> 03:06:26,490
...

4589
03:06:26,940 --> 03:06:27,480
...

4590
03:06:27,480 --> 03:06:27,580
...

4591
03:06:27,580 --> 03:06:28,060
...

4592
03:06:28,060 --> 03:06:28,820
There we go!

4593
03:06:30,760 --> 03:06:31,140
Yay!

4594
03:06:32,620 --> 03:06:34,200
Okay, we gotta go this way!

4595
03:06:38,140 --> 03:06:38,680
Oh...

4596
03:06:39,380 --> 03:06:41,380
These ice levels are so easy!

4597
03:06:41,560 --> 03:06:43,080
I feel like I've been molded by them!

4598
03:06:44,720 --> 03:06:45,620
We're just over here!

4599
03:06:51,330 --> 03:06:53,730
I've been molded by these ice levels!

4600
03:06:54,490 --> 03:06:55,410
Why is it...

4601
03:06:55,410 --> 03:06:56,250
Why is it...

4602
03:06:56,250 --> 03:06:56,370
Why is it...

4603
03:06:56,370 --> 03:06:56,650
So...

4604
03:06:56,650 --> 03:06:57,330
So cold!

4605
03:06:59,540 --> 03:07:00,660
I think I'm going to freeze it!

4606
03:07:00,920 --> 03:07:02,580
I'm going to be able to wait out of here!

4607
03:07:03,880 --> 03:07:04,500
It's a...

4608
03:07:04,500 --> 03:07:04,980
It's such...

4609
03:07:04,980 --> 03:07:07,060
It's a classic ice puzzle from Pokemon!

4610
03:07:07,360 --> 03:07:08,480
Oh my god!

4611
03:07:08,580 --> 03:07:09,420
Look at him!

4612
03:07:09,900 --> 03:07:11,360
I wanna melt it!

4613
03:07:11,940 --> 03:07:13,640
But I gotta catch it!

4614
03:07:16,340 --> 03:07:16,900
Alright!

4615
03:07:17,300 --> 03:07:18,380
Get in my ball!

4616
03:07:19,860 --> 03:07:20,480
Pa-dump!

4617
03:07:20,860 --> 03:07:21,440
Pa-dump!

4618
03:07:21,760 --> 03:07:22,380
Pa-dump!

4619
03:07:22,540 --> 03:07:23,000
Click!

4620
03:07:23,360 --> 03:07:23,700
Yeah!

4621
03:07:24,620 --> 03:07:24,920
Alright!

4622
03:07:25,000 --> 03:07:26,500
Who wants to be the freezy?

4623
03:07:28,080 --> 03:07:30,540
The cold never bothered me anyway!

4624
03:07:33,660 --> 03:07:35,200
And any of pure ice!

4625
03:07:35,240 --> 03:07:37,120
It freezes any living thing it touches!

4626
03:07:37,660 --> 03:07:39,660
Locals are warned to stay away from them!

4627
03:07:39,940 --> 03:07:42,240
A nice hot bath can easily defrost anyone!

4628
03:07:43,060 --> 03:07:43,760
Alright!

4629
03:07:45,220 --> 03:07:46,980
Let's see you!

4630
03:07:55,960 --> 03:07:57,320
Well, it hasn't been named yet.

4631
03:07:57,600 --> 03:07:58,720
I've already lost track.

4632
03:07:59,200 --> 03:07:59,600
Again.

4633
03:08:03,300 --> 03:08:03,940
You know what?

4634
03:08:04,040 --> 03:08:04,660
Alright, Stray.

4635
03:08:04,840 --> 03:08:05,640
I'll give it to you.

4636
03:08:06,680 --> 03:08:07,080
Stray.

4637
03:08:12,030 --> 03:08:12,430
Stray.

4638
03:08:13,830 --> 03:08:15,010
Seijin, thank you for the super chat.

4639
03:08:15,130 --> 03:08:15,290
Thank you.

4640
03:08:15,490 --> 03:08:15,910
Thank you.

4641
03:08:16,110 --> 03:08:16,310
Oh!

4642
03:08:16,650 --> 03:08:17,250
Next time.

4643
03:08:17,450 --> 03:08:18,350
Next one I catch.

4644
03:08:19,110 --> 03:08:19,750
Stray.

4645
03:08:21,170 --> 03:08:21,810
Goon.

4646
03:08:21,910 --> 03:08:22,830
But I gotta be reminded.

4647
03:08:25,990 --> 03:08:26,630
Alright.

4648
03:08:26,630 --> 03:08:27,950
Next one I'll catch.

4649
03:08:35,090 --> 03:08:35,730
Okay.

4650
03:08:40,170 --> 03:08:41,790
I'm just going by random.

4651
03:08:42,190 --> 03:08:45,030
Sometimes I do super chat, sometimes I pick randomly.

4652
03:08:46,130 --> 03:08:47,290
It's how I feel.

4653
03:08:47,690 --> 03:08:48,630
It's a feeling.

4654
03:08:51,350 --> 03:08:53,670
You just keep you guessing, you know?

4655
03:08:53,830 --> 03:08:54,550
It's like, gotcha.

4656
03:08:55,370 --> 03:08:56,730
Gotta keep you on your toes.

4657
03:08:59,690 --> 03:09:00,850
It's a vibe.

4658
03:09:00,850 --> 03:09:01,010
It's a vibe.

4659
03:09:04,680 --> 03:09:06,350
Haha, Teehee, you're so random.

4660
03:09:09,070 --> 03:09:12,510
Oh my god, Teehee, you're so creepy and random.

4661
03:09:22,150 --> 03:09:22,850
Okay.

4662
03:09:23,990 --> 03:09:24,950
Let's see.

4663
03:09:26,650 --> 03:09:28,110
Sorry, I have to...

4664
03:09:29,960 --> 03:09:30,310
Alright.

4665
03:09:32,290 --> 03:09:33,730
Yes, I did it.

4666
03:09:33,810 --> 03:09:34,130
Yes, I did it.

4667
03:09:35,350 --> 03:09:36,910
Lowes random, XD.

4668
03:09:40,930 --> 03:09:44,250
You're plotting as Mario will not be getting to the...

4669
03:09:44,970 --> 03:09:47,270
...Metro Kingdom any time soon.

4670
03:09:47,950 --> 03:09:48,430
Eek!

4671
03:09:48,590 --> 03:09:49,050
Mario!

4672
03:09:49,370 --> 03:09:50,230
You got here quickly!

4673
03:09:50,650 --> 03:09:51,610
No time for games.

4674
03:09:51,850 --> 03:09:53,130
Your defeat will be swift.

4675
03:09:55,050 --> 03:09:55,690
Eek!

4676
03:09:55,970 --> 03:09:56,150
Petal!

4677
03:09:58,970 --> 03:09:59,970
Roar XD!

4678
03:10:00,350 --> 03:10:01,990
So random!

4679
03:10:02,810 --> 03:10:03,290
XD XD!

4680
03:10:04,430 --> 03:10:06,130
Sorry, I just made everybody, like...

4681
03:10:06,950 --> 03:10:07,590
Remember...

4682
03:10:07,590 --> 03:10:13,770
I remember back then, when I was on the Neopets, Neoports chat rooms.

4683
03:10:13,990 --> 03:10:16,270
I would spam, like, XD...

4684
03:10:16,890 --> 03:10:19,270
Like, act like, XDs all the time.

4685
03:10:21,290 --> 03:10:21,990
Zom's epic!

4686
03:10:26,270 --> 03:10:27,890
What happened to you at the hair salon?

4687
03:10:28,090 --> 03:10:31,670
They put a hair dye, and then, like, it burned my scalp a little.

4688
03:10:32,810 --> 03:10:33,410
I lied.

4689
03:10:33,550 --> 03:10:34,350
Okay, that was...

4690
03:10:34,350 --> 03:10:34,670
It's weird.

4691
03:10:34,810 --> 03:10:36,850
It wasn't the hair dye that burned my scalp.

4692
03:10:37,010 --> 03:10:38,390
It was when I was, like, shampooing.

4693
03:10:38,890 --> 03:10:43,210
And I have no idea what product they put in my hair when they were shampooing my hair.

4694
03:10:43,570 --> 03:10:44,350
And, like...

4695
03:10:44,350 --> 03:10:46,250
But, like, it, like, burned my scalp.

4696
03:10:46,250 --> 03:10:48,190
I have no idea what they used.

4697
03:10:48,190 --> 03:10:49,970
It wasn't even the hair dye.

4698
03:10:55,050 --> 03:10:56,590
Like, I have no idea.

4699
03:10:58,030 --> 03:10:59,130
Oh my god.

4700
03:10:59,530 --> 03:11:01,070
Bro, why are you setting ice...

4701
03:11:01,070 --> 03:11:02,490
Bro, my main...

4702
03:11:02,490 --> 03:11:04,570
Main mod is literally fire.

4703
03:11:10,560 --> 03:11:11,720
Uh, candies.

4704
03:11:12,120 --> 03:11:12,840
Thank you, Super Chat.

4705
03:11:12,960 --> 03:11:13,820
Thank you, thank you.

4706
03:11:13,920 --> 03:11:15,100
Oh, I heard about that.

4707
03:11:15,300 --> 03:11:17,180
And then, like, I heard that...

4708
03:11:18,340 --> 03:11:19,420
It's so awkward.

4709
03:11:19,700 --> 03:11:20,540
Cause, like...

4710
03:11:20,540 --> 03:11:21,320
Wait, what the fuck?

4711
03:11:21,340 --> 03:11:22,060
Why didn't it hit?

4712
03:11:22,940 --> 03:11:23,920
Guys, I didn't read.

4713
03:11:24,140 --> 03:11:25,440
Oh, why didn't it hit?

4714
03:11:26,240 --> 03:11:28,240
I read that, like...

4715
03:11:29,440 --> 03:11:30,000
Um...

4716
03:11:30,000 --> 03:11:30,860
Wait, what?

4717
03:11:31,380 --> 03:11:33,580
It doesn't do anything, but he's ice!

4718
03:11:37,540 --> 03:11:38,520
What the fuck?

4719
03:11:38,720 --> 03:11:39,640
But your ice!

4720
03:11:42,920 --> 03:11:43,960
He's heavier.

4721
03:11:43,960 --> 03:11:45,530
There's no way!

4722
03:11:45,700 --> 03:11:46,500
There's no way!

4723
03:11:46,760 --> 03:11:47,660
Eat more!

4724
03:11:48,040 --> 03:11:49,140
Eat more!

4725
03:11:51,590 --> 03:11:52,740
Eat more!

4726
03:11:56,790 --> 03:11:58,160
Keep eating!

4727
03:12:00,280 --> 03:12:01,120
Heheheheh.

4728
03:12:01,120 --> 03:12:01,600
Gheheheh.

4729
03:12:03,220 --> 03:12:03,480
Heheheheh.

4730
03:12:03,480 --> 03:12:03,820
Heheheh.

4731
03:12:03,820 --> 03:12:04,340
But like...

4732
03:12:04,340 --> 03:12:05,120
I heard...

4733
03:12:05,120 --> 03:12:07,900
Bungie canceled all marketing for the game...

4734
03:12:07,900 --> 03:12:09,520
Recently, afterwards.

4735
03:12:10,060 --> 03:12:10,660
Heheheh.

4736
03:12:10,660 --> 03:12:11,120
So like...

4737
03:12:11,120 --> 03:12:12,000
That's awkward.

4738
03:12:13,240 --> 03:12:14,360
Pool strength slowly...

4739
03:12:14,720 --> 03:12:14,900
Sorry!

4740
03:12:15,100 --> 03:12:17,060
But lowers abilities.

4741
03:12:17,460 --> 03:12:18,260
Wait, what does that mean?

4742
03:12:18,820 --> 03:12:20,580
How does it lower my ability?

4743
03:12:27,430 --> 03:12:30,130
Yeah, they recently shut it down afterwards.

4744
03:12:30,890 --> 03:12:31,890
Oh, and those attack?

4745
03:12:32,270 --> 03:12:32,970
Oh, it's bad?

4746
03:12:33,230 --> 03:12:33,630
Oh, okay.

4747
03:12:34,070 --> 03:12:35,190
I'm getting it out of there.

4748
03:12:38,570 --> 03:12:41,450
You seem like the Penguin Doom kind of gal.

4749
03:12:41,610 --> 03:12:45,630
I had no idea what the fuck that was.

4750
03:12:45,770 --> 03:12:50,290
But someone asked me to fucking say... You know who you are.

4751
03:12:50,510 --> 03:12:53,930
But in the custom voice pack, I had to record that...

4752
03:12:53,930 --> 03:12:56,670
Um, I had to record that shitpost.

4753
03:12:57,110 --> 03:12:59,330
I have no idea what that was.

4754
03:13:06,050 --> 03:13:09,910
Yes, someone requested that as a custom voice pack.

4755
03:13:10,510 --> 03:13:12,070
And I like, listened to it.

4756
03:13:12,110 --> 03:13:14,150
I like, listened to it.

4757
03:13:14,230 --> 03:13:15,510
And I was like, what the fuck?

4758
03:13:17,430 --> 03:13:20,030
I don't remember who it was, but you know who you are.

4759
03:13:20,310 --> 03:13:21,710
You know who you are.

4760
03:13:21,830 --> 03:13:23,690
The first I requested it.

4761
03:13:29,380 --> 03:13:31,460
I released the footage.

4762
03:13:37,180 --> 03:13:38,840
Wait, there's voice packs?

4763
03:13:39,020 --> 03:13:40,160
Gavin, thank you for Super Chat.

4764
03:13:40,260 --> 03:13:40,500
Thank you.

4765
03:13:40,600 --> 03:13:40,880
Thank you.

4766
03:13:41,080 --> 03:13:44,040
Oh, it was like the... It was the custom anniversary voice pack.

4767
03:13:44,200 --> 03:13:45,800
I did like 69... Wait, no.

4768
03:13:46,000 --> 03:13:47,920
I did 54 of them.

4769
03:13:48,180 --> 03:13:49,640
I only sold 54.

4770
03:13:50,600 --> 03:13:51,740
Because it was a lot.

4771
03:13:51,940 --> 03:13:53,400
And I'm very busy.

4772
03:14:00,250 --> 03:14:02,770
Mayo, still as strong as ever.

4773
03:14:03,330 --> 03:14:05,290
Beating me doesn't melt the ice.

4774
03:14:05,850 --> 03:14:06,410
There he is.

4775
03:14:06,570 --> 03:14:07,190
Get him!

4776
03:14:08,550 --> 03:14:09,330
Beat him up!

4777
03:14:09,430 --> 03:14:10,310
Beat up the nerd!

4778
03:14:11,170 --> 03:14:12,290
Beat him... Oh my god!

4779
03:14:12,450 --> 03:14:12,830
Oh my god!

4780
03:14:13,090 --> 03:14:15,170
They're like, Jojo beating him up.

4781
03:14:15,670 --> 03:14:16,470
Got his wand!

4782
03:14:16,470 --> 03:14:17,430
Got your nose!

4783
03:14:17,590 --> 03:14:18,110
Hee hee!

4784
03:14:20,410 --> 03:14:21,830
Now, how does this thing work?

4785
03:14:22,770 --> 03:14:23,690
Take his shoes!

4786
03:14:24,310 --> 03:14:24,530
Yeah!

4787
03:14:27,470 --> 03:14:28,510
Get that nerd!

4788
03:14:29,350 --> 03:14:30,910
No, you're doing it all wrong!

4789
03:14:31,130 --> 03:14:32,790
You have to set it to I for ice!

4790
03:14:33,010 --> 03:14:34,490
What about W for wombo?

4791
03:14:35,010 --> 03:14:37,350
When it should be set to I for incinerary!

4792
03:14:38,470 --> 03:14:39,650
Are you serious?

4793
03:14:40,410 --> 03:14:42,690
Is this the face of someone who is serious?

4794
03:14:43,650 --> 03:14:44,350
Oh wait!

4795
03:14:44,530 --> 03:14:45,050
It's right here!

4796
03:14:45,470 --> 03:14:46,210
Let's go, everyone!

4797
03:14:51,250 --> 03:14:52,710
Atom, thank you for the super chat.

4798
03:14:52,790 --> 03:14:53,510
Thank you, thank you.

4799
03:14:53,830 --> 03:14:55,290
I made Doki sing Maroon 5.

4800
03:14:55,490 --> 03:14:55,750
Oh yeah!

4801
03:14:55,990 --> 03:14:57,310
He made me sing Anima.

4802
03:14:59,210 --> 03:15:01,030
Mario, you'll pay for this!

4803
03:15:02,090 --> 03:15:03,210
So he backs up.

4804
03:15:06,990 --> 03:15:08,770
Alright, never melt ice.

4805
03:15:11,250 --> 03:15:12,690
Alan, thank you for the super chat.

4806
03:15:12,810 --> 03:15:13,610
Thank you, thank you.

4807
03:15:13,790 --> 03:15:15,110
Talking about custom voice packs.

4808
03:15:15,370 --> 03:15:16,550
Thank you so much for mine!

4809
03:15:16,730 --> 03:15:18,290
And sorry for making you create the script for me.

4810
03:15:18,730 --> 03:15:19,570
Alan, thank you for the super chat.

4811
03:15:19,610 --> 03:15:20,490
Thank you, thank you.

4812
03:15:20,890 --> 03:15:21,330
It's alright.

4813
03:15:22,030 --> 03:15:23,270
I didn't even create a script.

4814
03:15:23,430 --> 03:15:23,970
I just...

4815
03:15:23,970 --> 03:15:26,710
Oh yeah, some people asked me to create a scenario or something.

4816
03:15:26,990 --> 03:15:30,690
But like, majority of the time, when they want me to create a script, I just...

4817
03:15:30,690 --> 03:15:31,730
Just wing it.

4818
03:15:38,150 --> 03:15:40,930
Okay, they paid me 69.69 dollars.

4819
03:15:42,470 --> 03:15:44,030
Don't worry, Silent Snake.

4820
03:15:44,370 --> 03:15:44,750
Oh!

4821
03:15:45,130 --> 03:15:46,130
It's Shroob!

4822
03:15:47,210 --> 03:15:48,970
Okay, that's you, Shijin.

4823
03:15:49,470 --> 03:15:51,930
You're gonna be Last of Us.

4824
03:15:55,740 --> 03:15:56,820
Put him in.

4825
03:16:01,490 --> 03:16:03,790
Oh wait, you're so over-leveled.

4826
03:16:03,830 --> 03:16:04,450
Holy shit.

4827
03:16:06,070 --> 03:16:08,350
When the heck did Heftly get so over-leveled?

4828
03:16:08,350 --> 03:16:08,610
Oh.

4829
03:16:10,890 --> 03:16:11,250
True!

4830
03:16:13,750 --> 03:16:14,410
Silent Snake!

4831
03:16:14,510 --> 03:16:15,150
Thank you for the super chat.

4832
03:16:15,270 --> 03:16:15,450
Thank you.

4833
03:16:15,570 --> 03:16:16,050
Thank you.

4834
03:16:16,210 --> 03:16:17,250
Oh god, you poor soul.

4835
03:16:17,990 --> 03:16:19,670
I'm sorry, and I wasn't even you.

4836
03:16:20,130 --> 03:16:20,810
Ha ha ha ha.

4837
03:16:28,350 --> 03:16:28,710
Oh.

4838
03:16:28,950 --> 03:16:30,670
Okay, I have to actually damage it.

4839
03:16:31,790 --> 03:16:32,510
But like...

4840
03:16:33,850 --> 03:16:37,190
I have to damage it, but like, I cannot use Heftly.

4841
03:16:37,190 --> 03:16:38,670
Because Heftly is too...

4842
03:16:38,670 --> 03:16:39,530
Too strong.

4843
03:16:41,310 --> 03:16:43,230
Oh, everyone is too strong!

4844
03:16:50,520 --> 03:16:52,200
I love the little song.

4845
03:16:53,680 --> 03:16:54,600
Oh my...

4846
03:17:00,700 --> 03:17:02,120
You're gonna...

4847
03:17:02,120 --> 03:17:04,140
You're gonna go back in the box.

4848
03:17:04,520 --> 03:17:05,060
You're gonna...

4849
03:17:05,060 --> 03:17:07,340
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

4850
03:17:08,120 --> 03:17:09,240
You're gonna...

4851
03:17:09,240 --> 03:17:10,340
You're gonna...

4852
03:17:11,720 --> 03:17:12,600
Ooh...

4853
03:17:12,600 --> 03:17:14,020
Ha ha ha ha ha!

4854
03:17:14,600 --> 03:17:17,580
You've disappointed me for the last time!

4855
03:17:18,040 --> 03:17:18,640
Ha ha ha ha!

4856
03:17:19,620 --> 03:17:21,600
Turkey, please trust us.

4857
03:17:21,840 --> 03:17:23,060
He's strong!

4858
03:17:23,820 --> 03:17:25,300
He's not...

4859
03:17:25,300 --> 03:17:26,340
You're gonna...

4860
03:17:26,340 --> 03:17:28,520
You're gonna go back to the box.

4861
03:17:28,880 --> 03:17:30,020
Ha ha ha ha!

4862
03:17:30,880 --> 03:17:32,560
I've seen enough.

4863
03:17:32,560 --> 03:17:35,440
You've had one too many...

4864
03:17:35,440 --> 03:17:37,840
You two had one too many chances.

4865
03:17:38,720 --> 03:17:39,940
Ha ha ha ha!

4866
03:17:41,820 --> 03:17:44,000
You're just using it wrong!

4867
03:17:44,500 --> 03:17:45,400
Ha ha ha ha!

4868
03:17:46,760 --> 03:17:50,560
If He doesn't work the way I want it to work...

4869
03:17:50,560 --> 03:17:51,580
Then I...

4870
03:17:51,580 --> 03:17:53,440
Then it's not my fault!

4871
03:17:54,020 --> 03:17:54,620
Ha ha ha ha!

4872
03:18:02,660 --> 03:18:03,340
Alright.

4873
03:18:03,720 --> 03:18:04,900
Baseball cap time.

4874
03:18:05,360 --> 03:18:07,980
And even though you were in my party...

4875
03:18:07,980 --> 03:18:10,700
You don't get the luxury of being in the cave.

4876
03:18:11,220 --> 03:18:12,560
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

4877
03:18:14,700 --> 03:18:16,280
You don't get that luxury.

4878
03:18:19,680 --> 03:18:20,900
Zoniman, thank you to the super chat.

4879
03:18:21,000 --> 03:18:21,200
Thank you.

4880
03:18:21,320 --> 03:18:21,720
Thank you.

4881
03:18:21,980 --> 03:18:23,860
Where are these voice backs so I can avoid them?

4882
03:18:23,960 --> 03:18:26,400
And are these lucky bastards allowed to share them?

4883
03:18:26,560 --> 03:18:27,180
If they want to.

4884
03:18:27,240 --> 03:18:27,880
They can do what they want.

4885
03:18:28,020 --> 03:18:29,320
As long as they don't monetize it.

4886
03:18:35,670 --> 03:18:36,110
Uh...

4887
03:18:36,110 --> 03:18:38,290
Alright, hopefully you're gonna be there to...

4888
03:18:38,290 --> 03:18:40,930
You're gonna be there to, like, get captured.

4889
03:18:41,230 --> 03:18:43,010
To help me just throw rocks at...

4890
03:18:43,010 --> 03:18:44,230
Uh, throw caps at them.

4891
03:18:44,370 --> 03:18:45,030
Sorry, not rocks.

4892
03:18:46,750 --> 03:18:49,710
I'm only doing custom voice backs for, like, special occasions.

4893
03:18:49,710 --> 03:18:51,370
Just cause they do take a lot...

4894
03:18:51,370 --> 03:18:52,410
Of time...

4895
03:18:52,410 --> 03:18:53,710
To record, in general.

4896
03:18:54,690 --> 03:18:56,830
So, for it, it was, like, an anniversary thing.

4897
03:18:59,210 --> 03:19:01,310
Uh, Papa Smurf, thank you for the super chat.

4898
03:19:01,430 --> 03:19:02,330
Thank you, thank you.

4899
03:19:02,670 --> 03:19:04,410
Thanks for the gym motivation, Doki.

4900
03:19:07,490 --> 03:19:07,890
Yeah!

4901
03:19:09,170 --> 03:19:10,950
An alien from the shrew planet.

4902
03:19:11,070 --> 03:19:12,390
It speaks an unknown language.

4903
03:19:12,610 --> 03:19:16,550
It's rumored to have access to unbelievably advanced technology and weapons.

4904
03:19:16,650 --> 03:19:18,210
All it does is spit poison.

4905
03:19:18,710 --> 03:19:20,170
It just spits acid.

4906
03:19:20,290 --> 03:19:21,570
What do you mean, technology?

4907
03:19:22,610 --> 03:19:23,010
Alright.

4908
03:19:23,630 --> 03:19:24,290
How do you...

4909
03:19:24,290 --> 03:19:25,290
What, Shijun?

4910
03:19:25,390 --> 03:19:26,310
How do you spell your name?

4911
03:19:27,290 --> 03:19:28,290
Or, Seijun?

4912
03:19:31,830 --> 03:19:32,310
See...

4913
03:19:35,870 --> 03:19:36,350
Seijun.

4914
03:19:37,290 --> 03:19:37,770
Good.

4915
03:19:39,030 --> 03:19:39,410
Alright.

4916
03:19:42,730 --> 03:19:44,150
Alright, I got it right.

4917
03:19:44,390 --> 03:19:45,730
I spelled it correctly, too.

4918
03:19:46,390 --> 03:19:47,410
Oh, nice, max rappel.

4919
03:19:47,910 --> 03:19:48,290
Nice.

4920
03:19:54,390 --> 03:19:55,710
Alright, get it over here.

4921
03:19:56,050 --> 03:19:58,130
There has to be a heal, like, at...

4922
03:19:58,610 --> 03:19:59,090
Um...

4923
03:19:59,090 --> 03:20:00,350
There has to be a hill.

4924
03:20:00,750 --> 03:20:02,190
At the top of the tower, right?

4925
03:20:02,630 --> 03:20:03,590
Oh, goodbye dad.

4926
03:20:03,770 --> 03:20:04,490
Oh wait, no, you're fine.

4927
03:20:10,180 --> 03:20:11,940
Alright, now it's goodbye.

4928
03:20:12,220 --> 03:20:13,120
Okay, no, never mind.

4929
03:20:13,560 --> 03:20:14,040
Oh, shit.

4930
03:20:14,940 --> 03:20:15,500
That's fine.

4931
03:20:18,100 --> 03:20:19,620
Now it's goodbye.

4932
03:20:20,180 --> 03:20:20,580
Goodbye.

4933
03:20:22,460 --> 03:20:24,040
You don't matter to me.

4934
03:20:25,960 --> 03:20:28,000
Oh, it's New Dog City!

4935
03:20:34,660 --> 03:20:35,780
Nothing's biting me.

4936
03:20:35,920 --> 03:20:37,060
I just don't got it anymore.

4937
03:20:37,300 --> 03:20:38,180
Take my rock.

4938
03:20:38,340 --> 03:20:39,960
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

4939
03:20:42,040 --> 03:20:43,000
Don't ask.

4940
03:20:43,340 --> 03:20:44,560
Whoa, okay.

4941
03:20:50,700 --> 03:20:53,480
Alright, where is the... Whoa.

4942
03:20:55,720 --> 03:20:57,380
Alright, let's put down the slag.

4943
03:20:57,520 --> 03:20:58,240
We made it!

4944
03:20:58,520 --> 03:21:00,000
Wait, okay, we gotta do a Pokemon Center.

4945
03:21:02,440 --> 03:21:03,440
Crazy cat.

4946
03:21:04,740 --> 03:21:05,640
The fuck?

4947
03:21:06,860 --> 03:21:07,660
You get run over?

4948
03:21:07,980 --> 03:21:08,540
No.

4949
03:21:13,180 --> 03:21:15,000
My second airplane tag!

4950
03:21:15,280 --> 03:21:16,100
Don't get in our way!

4951
03:21:17,100 --> 03:21:18,280
Oh, they lost.

4952
03:21:18,960 --> 03:21:20,000
Oh, you lost tag.

4953
03:21:21,940 --> 03:21:23,560
Hey, you lost, though.

4954
03:21:23,660 --> 03:21:24,480
I got in the way.

4955
03:21:27,700 --> 03:21:28,960
Nice ride, bro.

4956
03:21:30,140 --> 03:21:33,340
Thanks, a stranger gave it to me.

4957
03:21:35,920 --> 03:21:37,720
Where the fuck is the Pokemon Center?

4958
03:21:37,880 --> 03:21:39,700
Oh my god, I'm so lost in the city.

4959
03:21:42,120 --> 03:21:44,300
Okay, there's Pauline and Luigi.

4960
03:21:45,340 --> 03:21:46,540
Where the fuck is the...

4961
03:21:49,300 --> 03:21:53,060
Where's the... Okay, I'm trying to find a Pokemon Center before I talk to the Toads.

4962
03:21:55,840 --> 03:21:57,360
Is it a crazy cat?

4963
03:21:57,680 --> 03:21:58,480
Oh, is that it?

4964
03:21:59,540 --> 03:22:00,820
I couldn't tell.

4965
03:22:01,360 --> 03:22:02,900
It's just yellow and purple.

4966
03:22:03,300 --> 03:22:04,340
Oh my god, it is.

4967
03:22:04,680 --> 03:22:06,200
Oh, they like linked together.

4968
03:22:08,620 --> 03:22:10,180
That's all the caps I want?

4969
03:22:13,670 --> 03:22:15,190
Oh, it's a better cap.

4970
03:22:15,610 --> 03:22:16,510
Wait, I need that.

4971
03:22:17,990 --> 03:22:19,170
Okay, nice.

4972
03:22:19,670 --> 03:22:20,310
Let's buy that.

4973
03:22:22,230 --> 03:22:23,290
That's all we need.

4974
03:22:26,940 --> 03:22:27,540
All right.

4975
03:22:28,040 --> 03:22:29,720
Let's heal our tired mons.

4976
03:22:29,980 --> 03:22:30,660
All right, guys.

4977
03:22:30,940 --> 03:22:33,680
I'm going to call it here because tomorrow's a very long day.

4978
03:22:34,900 --> 03:22:37,820
Tomorrow's going to be a very long day, so I'm going to call it here.

4979
03:22:37,940 --> 03:22:40,080
I would stream longer, but like...

4980
03:22:40,760 --> 03:22:42,050
If I didn't have like...

4981
03:22:44,280 --> 03:22:46,700
If I didn't have like double streams tomorrow.

4982
03:22:46,960 --> 03:22:49,440
And I want to see if I can finish Onimushu 2.

4983
03:22:49,440 --> 03:22:51,140
Yes, they said it's like a...

4984
03:22:51,140 --> 03:22:53,780
I read the thing and it's like five to six...

4985
03:22:53,780 --> 03:22:54,080
I don't know.

4986
03:22:54,220 --> 03:22:56,820
Five to eight hours depending on how poorly I do.

4987
03:22:58,820 --> 03:22:59,980
It's like Onimushu.

4988
03:23:00,120 --> 03:23:02,920
Oh my god, I'm doing what I did in the past.

4989
03:23:03,740 --> 03:23:09,780
Guys, you remember what I kept saying Onimushu in the beginning when I first played?

4990
03:23:10,220 --> 03:23:11,380
Oh my god.

4991
03:23:11,700 --> 03:23:13,160
Blast from the past.

4992
03:23:18,460 --> 03:23:21,620
Anyway, the past repeats itself.

4993
03:23:21,860 --> 03:23:23,200
But yes, I'm playing that tomorrow.

4994
03:23:23,460 --> 03:23:24,980
Old habits die hard.

4995
03:23:25,540 --> 03:23:28,440
Anyway, guys, thank you all for coming for today.

4996
03:23:28,640 --> 03:23:31,680
I had a fun time playing some more Super Mario mod.

4997
03:23:32,000 --> 03:23:33,460
I believe we have...

4998
03:23:33,460 --> 03:23:35,180
Well, we have three more worlds left.

4999
03:23:35,440 --> 03:23:38,620
So let's hope we can finish another world next playthrough.

5000
03:23:38,920 --> 03:23:40,900
And then get closer and closer to the end.

5001
03:23:40,900 --> 03:23:45,180
Hey guys, as always everybody, stay hydrated, posture check.

5002
03:23:45,420 --> 03:23:47,240
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

5003
03:23:47,460 --> 03:23:49,380
And if you stay up for me, head to bed.

5004
03:23:49,540 --> 03:23:50,820
Cause you deserve it.

5005
03:23:51,100 --> 03:23:52,520
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

5006
03:23:53,020 --> 03:23:53,720
Bye guys.

5007
03:23:54,240 --> 03:23:54,720
Bye.
