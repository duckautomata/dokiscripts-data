2
00:02:46,580 --> 00:04:03,780

3
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:10,580
for some errands uh for i hope for uh for my apartment um Because I was running out of, like, I was running out of shampoo.

4
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:14,400
Uh, so I was like, oh, I might as well grab some groceries and everything.

5
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,220
Um, so, uh, so I was going out today.

6
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,480
And it was a really quick errand.

7
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:24,780
And the thing is, when it's a really quick errand, I don't, okay, this might be, I don't know.

8
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,100
I'll reveal this.

9
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:33,840
But when it's a really quick errand and I'm out, oh, you guys might be thinking, Joki, you shouldn't be saying this out loud.

10
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,580
Um, also, okay, I'm getting way too distracted.

11
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,420
I'm sorry, I gotta stop.

12
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:37,440
I gotta stop him.

13
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,840
I'm actually getting way too distracted, guys.

14
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:47,360
But, I actually, I can't open.

15
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:48,880
I'm sorry.

16
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:52,160
I'm getting way too distracted for it.

17
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,140
For story time.

18
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,700
I have to be stopped.

19
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:01,840
Yeah.

20
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,560
But I trust the safety.

21
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:04,180
Also, oops.

22
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,380
I trust the safety of my apartment.

23
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:15,280
Because for those who don't know, in my apartment, you can't access my floor unless you have a fob.

24
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:21,380
You can't access any of the fobs and the fobs are directly connected to your floor.

25
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:32,880
So if you're living on like X floor and then you're like, you try to go to a different floor, it wouldn't work because you're because the beeper for the elevator was only registered directly to your floor.

26
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:36,760
So that's why I'm like, I can comfortably talk about this.

27
00:05:38,120 --> 00:06:01,480
um but anyway if i'm doing a really quick errand uh i'll say hey pizza if i'm doing a really quick errand and it's like you know like maybe like 10 to 15 minutes i won't lock my door because i'm like okay i'll be back in 15 minutes anyway and the only people that will break into my apartment would be my neighbors so i was like so i'm like okay if anyone tries to break into my apartment It will be my neighbors.

28
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:14,660
So, so, because, like, when I, you know, so, anyway, anyway, now that I say that, I'm going to start locking my apartment now.

29
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:23,100
Now that I say that, because, by the way, a reason why I'm comfortably talking about this is because now I'm going to start locking my apartment because something happened.

30
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:30,080
So, anyway, so, I was out doing errands.

31
00:06:30,100 --> 00:07:24,740
and then so there is an intercom outside my apartment and um and um the only way for like you know you're getting like uber eats or anything or ordering like or a package just being delivered to your place um they will do the intercom to your to your like uh you know to your phone like the intercom is connected to your phone and then you guys have to have to press a number to let people in and but they can only access your floor um so they only so if you let somebody in to the apartment and they go to the elevator they can only access your floor and it's time too so like um so when i was out doing errands i got a call from the intercom thing and like out of reflex i just let them in i and then i was thinking when i let them in.

32
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:28,100
I was thinking, wait, am I expecting anything?

33
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:37,680
I guess I'm just like, oh, okay, so I was like, wait, am I expecting anything?

34
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:39,240
And I was thinking, no, I didn't order anything.

35
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:44,020
I'm like, I'm like, it's Sunday, so there's no packages being delivered to me.

36
00:07:44,440 --> 00:08:20,430
So I'm like, what, what was that i was i was like oh my god what did i wait what did i who did i let in i was so confused i was like oh it's sunday like there shouldn't be any packages so um so i came back and there was and i went to my floor but there was no packages outside my door and i was like oh yeah no I was like,

37
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:23,130
wait, who was that?

38
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:24,590
Oh, God.

39
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:31,550
I was like, who requested my apartment on the intercom?

40
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,710
And I got, I freaked out.

41
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:38,730
I was like, did I got, did someone like, well, they technically didn't break in.

42
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:41,750
I like, they could just let themselves in.

43
00:08:42,210 --> 00:09:17,930
So, so I went downstairs and I was like, oh, maybe they left like in my mailbox or like in the package room and I checked that and I was like, oh there's nothing there's nothing there and then like so then I was like, okay I'm gonna go in and I came in and then that seems fine so I was just like and nothing was moved at all so I wasn't robbed or anything so I was just like what happened?

44
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:48,870
I was just like I was like What happened I didn't Those guys are like Oh I must see that I'm so confused So I checked everything Nothing was moved or placed anywhere I checked everything guys And because I was like And like you know Dad would say something you know Um Um Dad would say something if like You know something happened And you know,

45
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:51,550
he'd be like there's someone here or something.

46
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:59,050
And so I checked everything and It doesn't seem like anything was moved at all.

47
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:12,290
And so I was I was like And I was only gone for for like five I did I checked the closets and everything too.

48
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:14,310
So I was only gone for like

49
00:10:17,930 --> 00:11:26,450
and I was like was there like did they got the wrong apartment did they got like the wrong apartment or something and like accidentally clicked mine and like because like in the intercom you can like click you have to click on you can just like click on the apartment number like they'll give a search of everything and they can just click on like they just tap it and then just like be like ring ring ring and stuff like that so i am i i don't know what happened so anyway i'm going to start locking my door if i go out for for if i'm just outside for really quick hours so now now i'm gonna start locking my door if i'm going out for like less because i don't lock my door when i'm out for like 10 minutes because i'm just like oh i have to go back up i'm going 10 minutes in anyways so it'll be fine so now that i know i'll stop thank you for the ranking thank you thank you i've got a great stream those are new here hello my name is dokeybird um i usually stream on youtube but today i'm here

50
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:40,630
because i've been craving marvel rivals and um i was telling my chat a story that of i was telling i was giving my chat a story time uh potentially

51
00:11:43,650 --> 00:12:45,490
apartment but i don't know i'm i i i i i'm just going to assume that i'm just gonna assume that uh they just accidentally pressed my apartment because it's just a list and they just accidentally pressed mine and then i just let them in i'd if vampires are real i would most likely accidentally invite a vampire in uh in and kill and get everybody killed I will be that person also in a zombie apocalypse I mean if I wasn't the one that will kill everybody by becoming a zombie because I hid my bite wounds I will also accidentally let a zombie in um 100% now that I think about it I am not very well suited for adult life the the longer I live by myself the more I realize I'm very naive and ignorant Incredibly,

52
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:49,730
I feel like I lived in a different world compared to everyone else.

53
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:52,410
Yeah, we can tell.

54
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:55,210
I have zero survival instinct.

55
00:12:55,890 --> 00:13:06,150
If I was born 200 years earlier, I would be the child that they would discard because they're like, there's no hope for her to survive.

56
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:07,310
I feel like.

57
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:12,050
I'm pretty sure I will be discarded if I was born 200 years ago.

58
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:56,230
yeah you know like survival of the fittest I would not be in that category I will don't sell yourself short they'll marry you off first um to be married off I would have to know how I would have to know how to do chores and apparently um I'm very bad at taking care I literally have a cleaner comes here once a month Because I cannot do it I cannot even clean my own bathroom I have a cleaner that comes in once a month to do that for me

59
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:16,360
I'm gonna get sent to the nunnery Boy, thank you for the 10 gifted subs Thank you, thank you Oh yeah, I didn't even call a plumber to check my sink I just waited until I procrastinated And then it fixed itself.

60
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:18,360
And everything was okay.

61
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:23,120
Everything was okay after that.

62
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:25,360
Mm-hmm.

63
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,840
It fixed itself.

64
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,860
It was fixed in the end.

65
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:37,440
Level 5 Hype Trim from Jokey Telling Everyone How She Let Someone.

66
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:38,120
I don't!

67
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,140
No, no, no, no, no.

68
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,580
We don't know.

69
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:44,640
It's off.

70
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:45,800
Hypothetical.

71
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:50,900
We don't actually know if that's what happened, guys.

72
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,340
We don't know.

73
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:57,040
That's you in the worst.

74
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:03,100
We don't really know.

75
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,520
That doesn't make it better.

76
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,640
All right.

77
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:14,480
Anyway.

78
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,100
But yeah.

79
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:55,540
no i would definitely natural selection would have selected me um judging by my by how life has been life has been treating me i would be selected by natural natural selection anyway guys uh gaming thank you for the tier one sub thank you thank you okay i think of this 100 betties thank you thank you i go to turkey's house and steal the cheese's combo that's all right everything's fine so yeah that's what happened that's what happens man and to treat myself I bought myself tiramisu

80
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:19,900
I survived another day of not being selected by natural selection so I decided to treat myself to tiramisu alright let's play let's play rank and I'm most likely gonna lose but let's play for those who are wondering, I have not been playing um, I have not,

81
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:33,720
okay, so, I mean, I have been playing, I mean, I already had 722 matches played, yeah, ever since I came back from um, the Marble Rival Studios, uh, treat yourself for all of us, for, we don't know!

82
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:34,860
We don't know!

83
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:40,760
I treated myself to potentially not being robbed.

84
00:16:43,540 --> 00:17:12,320
we don't know so anyway so yeah no okay see look see zero matches played in the entire season zero I mean for this I went I played until eternity so okay so like how the mighty have fallen will this look one above all and then you know I'm still playing and then I'm still playing and then you know oh so starting less games now.

85
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:13,980
Celestia 2.

86
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:15,640
I stopped at Celestia.

87
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:18,460
And then I'm like eternity here.

88
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:24,020
And then this is when I took a little break from rank and just stayed in Diamond 1.

89
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:25,160
And now I'm back.

90
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:26,380
Now I'm back.

91
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,180
Celestia 3 right here.

92
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:31,600
Um, I didn't get kidnapped today.

93
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,160
Yay.

94
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,880
Now I'm like, yay!

95
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:35,800
Yay!

96
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,680
All right, let's play.

97
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:47,500
Let's play some some ranky rank I think like I'm out of range with it oh my gosh so fast

98
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:58,810
whoa thank you for the five gift of shows thank you thank you all right

99
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:11,950
oh yeah I got Lord on Loki like the moon play my comfort pick now who am I gonna vanish from this match

100
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:33,910
oh I mean, the fact that dad was just chilling and sleeping makes me feel more safe because then I'm like, okay, maybe nothing happened because he's just hanging out.

101
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:38,350
Like, he was just hanging out.

102
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:41,730
That just proves it wasn't a man that broke in.

103
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:42,330
Like,

104
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:48,210
okay, true.

105
00:18:49,030 --> 00:19:48,230
but there's nothing to steal here it's just basic because I got my wallet so there's actually I will tell you guys this right now in my apartment there's nothing valuable in my apartment it's literally all jokie merch and then because the only valuable thing like like monetary value wise I mean I still have my fucking PC like I can stream um but no there's so much Hulk Hulk players and Celestia and GM I don't know why there's so many of them um but it's only like Doki merch in my apartment like nearly 90% of the things in my apartment it's just Doki merch the only like thing that's of monetary like for monetary value if I am getting robbed would be in my wallet and the wallet was with me like I don't have like anything else in my apartment other than dokey merch and my pc

106
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:59,810
oh yeah and my lububu sorry and my fucking apparently eighty dollar lububu

107
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:23,140
they could sell that's true they could but they're all here all my dokey merch is here also this is my first this is my first game of the day so i'm gonna be like super super rusty 4, 3, 2, 1 Okay.

108
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,140
All you need to do is capture the mission area.

109
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:26,900
Got it?

110
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,060
Oh yeah, and then after I potentially could have been robbed, I took a nap.

111
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,740
I think I have zero survival instincts.

112
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:44,460
How do you- I checked around and be like, do I have everything?

113
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:57,160
Or like, and then when it took a nap, like I- I was like, all right, I think everything is, I think I'm safe.

114
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:57,940
Nap time.

115
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:02,020
No, she is so smart.

116
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:07,440
I know, I was like, I was like, okay, now I, nap time.

117
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,860
How are you alive?

118
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:12,960
I don't know.

119
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:16,220
I have like zero fear for like.

120
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:24,740
Like, oh, I could potentially got kidnapped or let some...

121
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:27,340
Oh, I froze that guy from our Wolverine.

122
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:27,940
Poor guy.

123
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,380
He was actually gonna kidnap him.

124
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:31,980
I'm like, you know what?

125
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,160
I feel so safe.

126
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:36,080
Let me just go sleep for like two hours.

127
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,440
I was paranoid.

128
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:44,280
I was like, who the fuck called my apartment?

129
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,220
Oh, shit.

130
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,320
I'm gonna stay away from my team.

131
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:52,460
Oh I knew at least I got solo.

132

Yeah, I like your streams too.

153
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:03,680
This seems offensive.

154
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:06,260
Yeah, they'll never know.

155
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,380
How would they know?

156
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,480
I'm just a fan account.

157
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:15,180
Yeah, I'm the Doki Bird Virus account.

158
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:21,060
Damn, this in this game is so real for that.

159
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,060
Yeah, exactly.

160
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,160
They'll just check my YouTube and they'll be like, Oh, she's not live.

161
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,080
That must not be her, then.

162
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:30,800
That's right.

163
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:31,880
Dance for me.

164
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:34,080
Exactly.

165
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:36,360
The real Jokey Bird is not Jokey Bird.

166
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:45,100
Alright.

167
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:48,540
Okay.

168
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:51,580
I clap, clap, clap, clap, clap.

169
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:54,800
Oh shit, sorry, I was not paying attention to you.

170
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,220
I just started clapping.

171
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,240
I couldn't help it.

172
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,420
Oh nice, I have my luck too.

173
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:08,300
Okay guys, like why don't we just hang out together?

174
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:09,660
Nice.

175
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:11,200
Clap, clap.

176
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,540
Clap, clap.

177
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:14,440
Start clapping, everybody.

178
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,120
That's right.

179
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,120
That's right.

180
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:23,460
What's that quote called?

181
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,320
Where, like, impersonation is not...

182
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,320
What's that famous quote for...

183
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:34,820
Do you know what I mean?

184
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:37,220
Also, from the office about impersonation.

185
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:41,660
Legend, Barry...

186
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:43,300
Where's my fucking team?

187
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,040
I am Luna Alting, guys.

188
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:46,060
Please, Stan.

189
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,240
Yeah, Dave Dryden is not a joke.

190
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,680
Also, they made a sequel.

191
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,420
I'm so tired.

192
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,080
They made a... My coffee.

193
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:53,200
you have to kick in.

194
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:57,620
Also, they made a sequel to The Office.

195
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:01,920
Or they are making a sequel to The Office.

196
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:04,480
And it's about, like, the dying newspaper company.

197
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:05,540
Yeah.

198
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:11,020
It's apparently going to be about the newspaper company.

199
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:15,960
And, like, how newspaper is, like, a dying media forum.

200
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,520
Yeah, it's by the creators of The Office.

201
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,400
I'm pretty sure it's going to be fucking garbage.

202
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:24,920
I'm pretty sure it's gonna...

203
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:28,240
It's just gonna bank on the nostalgia factor, I feel like.

204
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,200
I don't know.

205
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:31,500
Most likely.

206
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,780
Oh, goodbye.

207
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:37,180
This is where we die.

208
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,100
You're so good, Star Lord.

209
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:44,400
Wait, is my Loki alive?

210
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,180
Oh, he is.

211
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:45,840
Never mind.

212
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:46,560
He's not.

213
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,520
Don't worry, I'm coming back.

214
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:50,620
I don't know.

215
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,340
I feel like...

216
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:52,120
I just think it's gonna...

217
00:27:52,140 --> 00:28:39,020
be bad because um um because like apparently there is it's gonna be it's a stream it's gonna be streamed it's a um streaming exclusive i mean to be fair um everything is just streaming exclusive now but it's on the fucking peacock and who the fuck has i don't know who the fuck has a peacock description outside of i saw it i have a mirror like i can't even access peacock i mean we'll just start it because i don't know what else we can do i'm just gonna die actually okay well gretchen i think we can solve this uh 99

218
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:49,620
one three two one Okay, that's awkward.

219
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:51,920
Okay, who the fuck let's un-frozen?

220
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,480
Who un-frozen?

221
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:04,720
Okay, we could have lived that if you know.

222
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:12,900
You did unfreeze the Captain America and then let him get fucking slammed on fire by our...

223
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,420
Oh, we're dead.

224
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,100
We're so dead.

225
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:16,600
We're not winning that.

226
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:19,140
I'm dead too.

227
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:20,620
I missed it too.

228
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:21,220
That sucks.

229
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,140
if I didn't miss the freeze.

230
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:27,740
Yo, you want to go back to Wolf?

231
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:30,100
Well, no, I used the Luna ult.

232
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:32,540
I knew we weren't going to win that because we were down too.

233
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:35,380
I just, I used the Luna ult so we could guarantee 99.

234
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:38,200
That was the only reason I used the Luna ult.

235
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,540
I knew we weren't going to win it.

236
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:44,240
I just wanted to get the 99 because it's just safer than potentially using that to...

237
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:50,860
Because if I use it to potentially try and get the point back and then like, most, more likely that we were...

238
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:51,660
Oh my gosh!

239
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:58,060
If we're all gonna hit him after my freeze, you better, it better be a secure kill.

240
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:01,100
It's, I fucking freeze the iron fist.

241
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:01,960
Guys.

242
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:06,420
Oh my god, the pointy thing hit me.

243
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:13,380
Okay, nice.

244
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:13,900
That's good.

245
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,260
But I'm definitely not gonna grab.

246
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:20,000
I'm definitely not gonna grab all in time, though.

247
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:52,420
nice when did we get a thing oh oh hey nice i got i got shielded i still died it doesn't matter it still died oh and then i don't think we win this round i mean someone has to play strange and pretend okay let's hope we don't see none Oh, that sucks.

248
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:55,220
Come on.

249
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:55,920
Okay.

250
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:58,080
This is the only thing I can do.

251
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,340
It's just, someone better be portaling!

252
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:01,240
Yay!

253
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,160
Yay!

254
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:04,820
We portals!

255
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:06,040
Yay!

256
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:09,220
All right.

257
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:10,700
Oh, yeah, no.

258
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:16,960
Unless our mag gets a fucking juicy ass, um, nope.

259
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:18,180
He had to get, he had to.

260
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,440
I had to hit that mag up.

261
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:25,000
He literally had to hit that mag up to win.

262
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,160
That's so unlucky.

263
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:32,280
Aww, that's so unlucky.

264
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:35,160
Where's my tiramisu?

265
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:37,400
Oh, there it is.

266
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:37,920
Hey.

267
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,240
Yay, tiramisu.

268
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:49,880
Music makes people happy.

269
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,640
Maybe I can do both.

270
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:55,660
I have no idea.

271
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:58,260
I'm rewarded.

272
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:02,020
For losing that round, I'm rewarding myself by a tiramisu.

273
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:04,740
Yeah, it's good.

274
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:06,900
Pretty good.

275
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,140
Yeah, I can play it again.

276
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:17,620
Yeah, I can play you a few of my tracks after the battle if you want.

277
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:22,160
Well, thanks, but damn, really more of a classic rock guy.

278
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,040
Alright, I have my guard dog here.

279
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:28,280
I'm safe, right?

280
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:33,680
I'm safe, right?

281
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,260
I didn't...

282
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:35,380
I'm the one with the...

283
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:36,640
He's here.

284
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:37,560
Hmm.

285
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,740
That's why I'm asking my dog.

286
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,200
I'm safe, right?

287
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,640
Oh, that was unlucky.

288
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:50,540
That should have been a hit.

289
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,660
The ricochet fucked me up.

290
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:54,740
Good medicine.

291
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,480
Oh, of course they're going.

292
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:58,240
Die!

293
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:00,960
What the fuck?

294
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:01,700
I hear?

295
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:03,200
Let...

296
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:03,880
Oh, okay.

297
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:07,740
Okay, this might be where we die.

298
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:08,480
Oh, I'm...

299
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:08,920
No, no.

300
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:09,580
We're fine.

301
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:12,760
We're fine.

302
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:15,320
The fact I have to stay in this alt, though.

303
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:16,580
This sucks.

304
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,860
Okay, I froze him.

305
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:23,440
Oh, my God.

306
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,200
That is a lot of scabs.

307
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:25,520
That...

308
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:27,700
There's so many ults.

309
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:32,530
Really?

310
00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:33,810
We still haven't capped?

311
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:34,490
Okay.

312
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:38,370
Dad's side eyes.

313
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:40,230
I have no.

314
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:40,750
No, I know.

315
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:42,170
I have no survival instincts.

316
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:43,270
Don't worry.

317
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:43,990
Hey.

318
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:55,210
Oh, that was...

319
00:33:55,210 --> 00:33:58,090
That was actually like a Hail Mary breeze.

320
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:00,950
I had no idea if I was going to hit anything there.

321
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:07,650
I'm not gonna do it yet.

322
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:09,350
Yep, there we go.

323
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:13,090
Oh, nice.

324
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:14,250
Yay!

325
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:17,110
My old is better!

326
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:19,110

327
00:34:19,470 --> 00:34:21,010
My buddies!

328
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:29,670
We need, we need to fucking keep our look, we have to get us all.

329
00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:30,630
Okay.

330
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:32,970
Don't worry, I got you, Loki.

331
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:37,010
Oh, I should have maybe kept it on maybe our Starlight.

332
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:41,870
Okay, that is a very scary.

333
00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:47,890
Oh my god, I'm scared!

334
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:53,590
Oh hey, our strange had like a fucking juicy ass up there.

335
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:56,270
Don't worry, I trust my team.

336
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:57,410
I have high ground.

337
00:34:59,030 --> 00:34:59,890
Let's go!

338
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:04,930
Oh, it was a juicy ass up.

339
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:10,550
All right, I'm chilling now.

340
00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:15,670
Oh, they didn't know I missed.

341
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:19,190
They don't know I'm not on YouTube right now, so they can't tell.

342
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:20,810
Oh, shit.

343
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:21,270
It's okay.

344
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:21,910
I got him.

345
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:25,570
I mean, he's won.

346
00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:28,330
Guys, this is my first game, guys.

347
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:30,150
This is, guys, this is my first game.

348
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:35,410
Please, this is my first game, guys.

349
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:39,390
I am allowed to miss my shots on my first game.

350
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:45,470
Jesus Christ.

351
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:48,190
I am.

352
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:53,030
Guys?

353
00:35:56,010 --> 00:35:56,950
Okay, he's one.

354
00:35:57,090 --> 00:35:58,210
I'm fucking gonna punch him.

355
00:35:59,070 --> 00:35:59,370
Come on.

356
00:35:59,470 --> 00:35:59,890
Get over here.

357
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:00,390
Get over here.

358
00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:00,990
Get over here.

359
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:01,010
Get over here.

360
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:04,490
Get your fucking ass over here!

361
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:08,070
There we go.

362
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:08,430
What?

363
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:13,290
I was like, get down from there!

364
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:16,570
Fight me like a man!

365
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:19,910
Get your ass down here!

366
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:23,670
I think it was actually 1 HP.

367
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:24,790
I laugh.

368
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:27,930
It was definitely 1 HP there.

369
00:36:28,610 --> 00:36:30,070
Uh, boys, thank you for the tier 1 subs.

370
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:31,130
Thank you, thank you.

371
00:36:32,410 --> 00:36:35,270
If it's real you, you are so good at it.

372
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:36,190
It's not.

373
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:41,890
It's not.

374
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:52,330
They will never know.

375
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:55,790
You're a big bit of his imagination.

376
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:59,950
Every time someone asks me if I'm the real dokey, but I just say no.

377
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:03,190
Just to fuck with them.

378
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:05,610
And they'll never know.

379
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:06,870
I'm so humble.

380
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:08,310
I'm so humble.

381
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:12,330
Hey, look, I win.

382
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:13,090
Oh my god.

383
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:15,730
Am I actually gonna get Celeste 2?

384
00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:17,370

Oh, okay, she doesn't like role-playing.

407
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:37,490
Hello, we are... Hello, we're just fellow role-players.

00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:38,790
Please don't hurt us.

409
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:41,490
We're just here to chill.

410
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:44,070
I'm so cute.

411
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:48,010
Am I just schizo?

412
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:50,270
Was that... was that person real?

413
00:39:50,290 --> 00:39:53,430
Oh my god, is this... Oh, this guy?

414
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:54,010
Okay.

415
00:39:54,890 --> 00:39:57,070
This guy peaked...

416
00:39:57,490 --> 00:39:59,870
GM, like, this is his first season.

417
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:00,570
I think it's him.

418
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:03,890
Okay, wait, I just gotta know if he gets mad, I'll know if it's him or not.

419
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:08,190
Um, I think it's him.

420
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:09,290
I'm pretty sure.

421
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:18,170
But then I don't want to, like, if I don't want to be, like, mistaken identity, but I had a game whose name is very similar to this.

422
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:20,350
But if he gets mad, then I'll know it's him.

423
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:24,170
But anyway, so, Black Panther, really?

424
00:40:24,170 --> 00:41:41,630
in the sea though i guess in the sea though usually i just ban human torch but no he get he probably ban torch oh no it's him over in here it's him okay this guy um no he is very easily rage baitable because what happened was that um he was complaining about the lack of heals while we were triple support and um but he was the only one dying because of his lack of positioning and he was like trying to like he was like yelling at my duo who's a pro player and like trying to teach him the game and then um my friend was like my friend was like oh sorry okay i'll heal you better than and then he kept complaining he kept complaining and then our tank was like why are you so angry like he's gonna heal you and then he kept arguing again and then he argues with our player and being like you don't understand he was judging my play style he was judging me he was but i wasn't getting healed and i was in the right and then we're like and then he our tank was like why are you no why are you so angry

425
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:53,630

426
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:57,330
Like, but why are you so mad?

427
00:41:57,490 --> 00:41:59,210
Like, he said he'll heal you.

428
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:02,210
And then he kept fucking, he kept going on.

429
00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:06,170
Like, like, my friend stopped talking.

430
00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:07,750
He was just like, yeah, okay, I'll heal you.

431
00:42:07,870 --> 00:42:12,090
And then he, the guy just kept arguing with his inner demons.

432
00:42:13,770 --> 00:42:15,990
He kept, no, he was on DPS.

433
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:18,070
This guy was on DPS, like, the mining guy was on DPS.

434
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:19,690
And then he just kept arguing.

435
00:42:19,830 --> 00:42:21,270
Like, we were like, why are you still?

436
00:42:21,350 --> 00:42:40,550
We all stopped talking and he was just arguing with no one That's the thing he was just he was arguing No, but no one was talking to him and he just kept going And I was like bro are you?

437
00:42:41,490 --> 00:42:43,810
I was like bro, do you know your ass?

438
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:50,550
Like it was crazy because I was like Like are you bro?

439
00:42:50,810 --> 00:42:54,730
I was just like You are not, you are, you, and he's still playing.

440
00:42:54,990 --> 00:43:00,690
Wait, this was this morning, because I played one, like two games of Marble Rivals, and he's still playing.

441
00:43:01,070 --> 00:43:04,990
It's been, it's been like 10 hours.

442
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:07,310
He's still on, I just realized.

443
00:43:07,830 --> 00:43:10,370
He's still, I played like two games this morning.

444
00:43:10,470 --> 00:43:11,830
He's still on.

445

00:43:37,270 --> 00:43:38,450
I was like, wait a minute.

450
00:43:39,090 --> 00:43:41,110
He's like, wait a minute.

451
00:43:43,650 --> 00:43:47,190
He has not stopped queuing since this morning.

452
00:43:47,670 --> 00:44:20,010

00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,020
What Rink does.

471
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:34,380
What Rink does to people.

472
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:37,680
God damn.

473
00:46:38,740 --> 00:46:40,800
I'm not bunching up with my Luna.

474
00:46:41,620 --> 00:46:42,520
Because of the Phoenix.

475
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:44,240
I'm scared.

476
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:47,380
I'm not that good at Loki.

477
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:48,600
I'm still learning.

478
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:51,680
But like.

479
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:53,080
That's why I'm playing.

480
00:46:53,100 --> 00:47:20,860
him more right now because I want to get better at low-key I have Lord though because like what how many seasons it has it been all right check recent matches no he has public his matches are public I'll check it I want to know how long he's been playing for if he did take a break like good for him I I think he needs it.

481
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:25,060
I hope he did take up Bray because he definitely needs it.

482
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,980
I'm glad they're nerfing Loki.

483
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:38,800
He's such a...

484
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:42,900
Come on, Luna!

485
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:43,940
You got this!

486
00:47:44,540 --> 00:47:50,380
I don't know where people are, but like... Oh, you know what?

487
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:50,980
That's fine.

488
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:51,460
That's fine.

489
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:51,920
That's fine.

490
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:53,000
He doesn't know!

491
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:53,900
He doesn't know!

492
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:55,900
Oh my god.

493
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:56,680
Oh my god.

494
00:47:56,860 --> 00:47:57,260
We're okay.

495
00:47:57,600 --> 00:47:58,240
We're okay.

496
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,180
We're so healthy.

497
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:00,900
Oh Luna.

498
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:01,420
It's okay.

499
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:01,720
Sorry.

500
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:02,960
I left you to die.

501
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:06,660
We're so okay.

502
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:08,280
I don't know.

503
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:10,460
I was not supposed to live.

504
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:13,360
All right.

505
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:14,260
That was so close.

506
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:17,480
I thought I was gonna lose my... Thank God for Celestia.

507
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:19,220
Thank God for this Elo.

508
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:23,020
Or Luna would be fine.

509
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:26,840
Yeah, the reason why I shoot the floor is because of the splash damage.

510
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:29,480
The floor heals more.

511
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:30,880
Yeah, definitely.

512
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:32,200
There's only Spider-Man.

513
00:48:33,020 --> 00:48:33,640
Here they are.

514
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:34,980
The hook.

515
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:36,820
They don't know which is the real clone.

516
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:40,220
They'll be like, which one's the real one?

517
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:42,580
They'll be like, I don't know.

518
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:44,260
See, they don't know.

519
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:44,620
Wow!

520
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:45,100
Ah!

521
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:48,700
Mag touching, mag touching.

522
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:50,980
Okay, I don't know.

523
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:52,600
I thought he wouldn't know, you know?

524
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:58,340
Okay, how did he know?

525
00:48:58,980 --> 00:48:59,720
How did he know?

526
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:01,400
I was literally not moving.

527
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:02,680
How did he know?

528
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:05,020
He could have shot any of us.

529
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,600
No, how did he know?

530
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:11,860
He's some menace.

531
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:15,640
There was literally three of us.

532
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:17,000
There was three of us.

533
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:18,540
How did he know?

534
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:21,180
I didn't move!

535
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:23,160
I was literally just going left and right!

536
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:26,780
My disguise was perfect!

537
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:34,120
There were three of us!

538
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:35,640
One was at the balcony!

539
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:37,480
Oh my god, 97.

540
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:38,480
A fucking course.

541
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:40,520
A fucking course I didn't get...

542
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:43,180
I didn't get like 23 or some shit.

543
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:47,400
I'm at it pretty well.

544
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:49,100
I got... I got his.

545
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:50,780
Alright.

546
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:52,420
Oh, yeah.

547
00:49:52,860 --> 00:49:53,400
Let's check.

548
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:55,040
Let's check if it's him.

549
00:49:59,180 --> 00:50:01,300
I don't remember what match it was.

550
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:02,420
Let me double check.

551
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:04,700
I don't even remember what match it was.

552
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:06,280
It was...

553
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:08,480
Oh, it was the one I lost.

554
00:50:08,580 --> 00:50:09,380
Yeah, it is him.

555
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:10,340
Alright.

556
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:12,380
Oh, no, he is.

557
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:15,500
No, no, he is...

558
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:15,740
No.

559
00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:22,460
Guys, no, he is definitely, guys, today's the 24th, right?

560
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:33,640
No, he's been, oh yeah, no, oh yeah, no, he's been, he's been playing since, he's been playing since 1.32 p.m.

561
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:52,780
Yeah, today is the 20, he has been on 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24.

562
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:57,540
So what is enjoying this Sunday?

563
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:05,840
Yeah, this, yeah, he's definitely been, he's definitely been playing since this morning.

564
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:10,780
Yeah, he's melted into the gaming chair.

565
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:11,760
Yeah.

566
00:51:13,620 --> 00:51:17,380
Yeah, no, that's why I told you all it took was one day.

567
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:19,920
bad game for to push that man off the edge.

568
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:22,360
Oh, hey, Pizza.

569
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:24,200
Aren't you playing right now?

570
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:27,980
I saw you on earlier.

571
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:30,780
Alright.

572
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:33,340
Another... Your Celestia 1?

573
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:34,680
Wait, what happened?

574
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:36,020
Pizza?

575
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:37,480
What happened?

576
00:51:45,170 --> 00:51:46,630
Not even online.

577
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:47,850
Yeah, I'm down.

578
00:51:49,890 --> 00:51:51,890
A Bad day happened.

579
00:51:54,790 --> 00:51:56,650
Don't know what happened.

580
00:51:59,430 --> 00:51:59,770
Oh, wait.

581
00:51:59,850 --> 00:52:00,870
That's your account?

582
00:52:03,490 --> 00:52:04,730
Oh, that's you?

583
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:09,740
All right.

584
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:13,180
Hey, at least I lose less.

585
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:21,660
If I kill the Celestial 1, and we lose, I lose less.

586
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,940
less because I'm on Celestio 3.

587
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:26,160
That's the pro.

588
00:52:27,180 --> 00:52:28,300
Don't jinx it.

589
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:30,700
I mean, pizza lose more, but I lose less.

590
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:32,280
True.

591
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:34,460
They're because they're using dual PC.

592
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:35,840
I have.

593
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:36,500
Yeah.

594
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:44,220
But then, like, also, I'm worried about, I feel like I could fuck it up.

595
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:47,260
Pizza got rid of that.

596
00:52:47,260 --> 00:52:48,580
What even is the hamstring mode?

597
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:52,020
I don't even have, like, what was the newest one.

598
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:54,420
I only have better TV on for my channel.

599
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:56,060
I don't remember what the newest one is called.

600
00:52:56,660 --> 00:52:59,300
Like, I say new, but I don't use Twitch that much anyway.

601
00:53:03,450 --> 00:53:04,170
7TV, yeah.

602
00:53:04,330 --> 00:53:05,850
I don't even have 7TV on.

603
00:53:07,170 --> 00:53:09,370
Because I'm just, I guess I'm just lazy.

604
00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:12,530
Because I don't use Twitch as much, so I'm just lazy.

605
00:53:12,570 --> 00:53:13,070
Who's pizza?

606
00:53:13,250 --> 00:53:13,710
This guy.

607
00:53:14,390 --> 00:53:15,070
Eating pizza.

608
00:53:16,990 --> 00:53:22,290
Yeah, 7TV has a lot of fun emo shit, but I'm just I'm too lazy to set that up.

609
00:53:23,530 --> 00:53:25,930
I mean, my mods can try and set that up.

610
00:53:26,310 --> 00:53:28,510
And they can choose all the emos they want to choose.

611
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:36,100
He's like, anyway, mods want to set up 7TV.

612
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:37,740
Emotes for my channel.

613
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:41,980
Or we'll never have 7TV emotes.

614
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:48,000
No, he just plays Iron Fist and...

615
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,680
Well, he's playing Meta this season.

616
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:53,660
This season, he's going Meta.

617
00:53:55,180 --> 00:53:57,020
Hello fellow roleplayers.

618
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:00,740
Hello.

619
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:07,600
Oh my god.

620
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:10,660
Oh my god, this is not a roleplaying lobby.

621
00:54:12,780 --> 00:54:14,380
Oh hello.

622
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:17,620
Turns around.

623
00:54:18,820 --> 00:54:20,380
Knows there's danger.

624
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:22,020
Oh my god.

625
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:24,520
He's a menace spy.

626
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:25,160
I knew spy.

627
00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:26,920
Spider-Man is a fucking menace.

628
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:27,840
I knew it.

629
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:31,900
Just a little bit of trolling.

630
00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:37,100
All right, let's see.

631
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:37,580
What is...

632
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:39,440
I wish there's, like, the SR average.

633
00:54:39,740 --> 00:54:43,200
Like, in Overwatch, you can see the average of the SR.

634
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:44,540
Or the ranking.

635
00:54:44,660 --> 00:54:46,560
So you know who's, like...

636
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:49,060
Oh, my God, Widow.

637
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:50,660
All right.

638
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:52,540
Oh, the Doom Q starts now, I guess.

639
00:54:53,980 --> 00:54:56,560
I guess we're starting the Doom Q.

640
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:57,060
now.

641
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:02,760
I knew he was a menace.

642
00:55:02,980 --> 00:55:03,880
They were right.

643
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:08,660
Don't listen to the fake news.

644
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:12,600
He's your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man.

645
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:15,020
I only listen to the truth.

646
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:53,890
I only, I only read one newspaper and that's daily was a daily boggle or some child with my I only read one newspaper and I listen to my favorite podcaster the daily daily bully bugle days are daily bugle look I keep up with DC and not Marvelous Marvel Rival is the one Marvel Rivalous and James Gunn are the only reason why I ever kept up with Marvelous I'm adding Yeah,

Not the 5Gs.

650
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:34,280
It's true.

651
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:35,940

652
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:39,760
Yeah, the 5Gs are turning the spot is gay.

653
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:46,880
Oh, trust Spider-Man.

654
00:56:49,820 --> 00:56:51,320
Shut up.

655
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:54,140
I have powers.

656
00:56:54,580 --> 00:56:55,780
What the heck are you talking about?

657
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:57,100
That's right.

658
00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:01,800
Donate to me so I can donate to JJ.

659
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:06,080
He needs my help.

660
00:57:06,740 --> 00:57:07,340
To...

661
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:08,660
He needs my help.

662
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:10,360
To spread the news.

663
00:57:11,460 --> 00:57:12,500
Spread the truth.

664
00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:24,280
I feel like

665
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:30,080
I hear, like, oh my, I don't know what Mantis is.

666
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:34,960
I have not played Mantis in so long, though, so I feel so rusty.

667
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:40,780
Slamming three, two, one.

668
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:42,940
No lamps.

669
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:46,280
I wish I could play Loki.

670
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,460
I'm gonna play Loki after this, actually.

671
00:57:48,860 --> 00:57:52,340
I don't think it's worth playing Mantis for our widow.

672
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:55,180
I don't see no head clicking right now.

673
00:57:59,530 --> 00:58:28,070
oh i should have maybe i should stop healing our our widow sorry dude i keep i keep accident okay i'm walking i'm fucking swapping he's not doing jack all right there you go i swapped that 60 because like at 50 um if you were more than 50 then like every time you swap it It just goes back to 50 anyway.

674
00:58:31,050 --> 00:58:33,130
I don't think our widow is doing anything.

675
00:58:33,730 --> 00:58:37,530
So there's no use in giving him a damage boost.

676
00:58:37,550 --> 00:58:38,070
Lucky defense.

677
00:58:39,530 --> 00:58:41,130
I am ready to put on a show.

678
00:58:42,890 --> 00:58:43,410
We have combo.

679
00:58:44,250 --> 00:58:44,850
There we go.

680
00:58:45,410 --> 00:58:46,730
Oh my god!

681
00:58:47,870 --> 00:58:49,690
Um, our Luna lives though.

682
00:58:50,310 --> 00:58:51,550
He fucking holds no more anything.

683
00:58:52,450 --> 00:58:53,350
I'm a Luna, she's a Luna.

684
00:58:54,010 --> 00:58:54,370
I'm a Luna.

685
00:58:55,230 --> 00:58:56,450
He's unlucky for me.

686
00:58:58,130 --> 00:58:58,770
Oh,

687
00:59:05,130 --> 00:59:06,470
I wanted to damage boost.

688
00:59:07,170 --> 00:59:09,730
Well, I mean, we both.

689
00:59:10,470 --> 00:59:12,050
I was going to try and damage boost that pizza.

690
00:59:14,170 --> 00:59:15,250
Oh, my God, please.

691
00:59:15,850 --> 00:59:17,070
Get away!

692
00:59:22,510 --> 00:59:24,750
Why are you running away?

693
00:59:25,070 --> 00:59:26,370
Please come back.

694
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:31,540
Please come back.

695
00:59:33,260 --> 00:59:34,680
some magic on us

696
00:59:38,420 --> 01:00:05,680
i don't think we're i think this is where the doom queue starts 100 oh my god he swapped off he actually swapped off yeah that's a good old widow's special i just feel like widow's not good in this meta anymore or like he's never he is good if like with mantis but like we need to run triple support I feel like Romantic is the way in general.

697
01:00:10,210 --> 01:00:11,210
Oh my god, he's so low.

698
01:00:12,330 --> 01:00:12,770
Sucks.

699
01:00:13,150 --> 01:00:14,370
I thought we could get him.

700
01:00:16,290 --> 01:00:16,870
Oh, please.

701
01:00:17,270 --> 01:00:17,570
No!

702
01:00:18,130 --> 01:00:19,350
I had to reload.

703
01:00:19,550 --> 01:00:20,570
I'm sorry, man.

704
01:00:23,090 --> 01:00:23,890
Oh my god.

705
01:00:24,190 --> 01:00:24,550
That's fine.

706
01:00:25,110 --> 01:00:25,570
I live.

707
01:00:27,630 --> 01:00:28,810
I might not live here.

708
01:00:29,510 --> 01:00:30,390
I might not live here.

709
01:00:33,730 --> 01:00:37,910
We heal each other and then everything will be okay.

710
01:00:41,630 --> 01:00:42,190
Oh.

711
01:00:45,550 --> 01:00:45,710
Oh.

712
01:00:46,230 --> 01:00:47,270
Don't worry, I got you.

713
01:00:49,970 --> 01:00:51,090
Don't worry, I got you.

714
01:00:51,710 --> 01:00:54,590
We're still fighting this, but don't worry, I got you.

715
01:00:55,770 --> 01:00:56,550
Thanks so much.

716
01:00:58,210 --> 01:00:59,230
Time to fight.

717
01:00:59,670 --> 01:01:00,890
Don't worry, I got you.

718
01:01:01,870 --> 01:01:03,310
Your powers are mine.

719
01:01:03,630 --> 01:01:04,630
Come to me, please.

720
01:01:06,050 --> 01:01:07,810
I'm ready to put on a show.

721
01:01:08,930 --> 01:01:09,410
Hold damage.

722
01:01:10,770 --> 01:01:11,990
This one on me.

723
01:01:12,790 --> 01:01:13,750
Oh my god.

724
01:01:13,990 --> 01:01:14,190
Okay.

725
01:01:14,990 --> 01:01:15,710
I damaged.

726
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:16,290
I...

727
01:01:16,290 --> 01:01:16,610
Here goes.

728
01:01:16,710 --> 01:01:17,070
Here goes.

729
01:01:17,070 --> 01:01:17,310
It goes.

730
01:01:17,790 --> 01:01:18,350
Magic, magic, magic.

731
01:01:18,850 --> 01:01:21,410
I damaged.

732
01:01:22,030 --> 01:01:23,090
I did my job.

733
01:01:24,590 --> 01:01:25,110
I did my...

734
01:01:25,110 --> 01:01:27,650
Wow, it's like, Widow was just not the pick.

735
01:01:29,630 --> 01:01:32,870
We swapped and things worked out.

736
01:01:33,030 --> 01:01:33,610
Who would have thought?

737
01:01:33,630 --> 01:01:34,330
I thought!

738
01:01:35,150 --> 01:01:35,370
Widow!

739
01:01:35,570 --> 01:01:36,050
Oh my god!

740
01:01:36,210 --> 01:01:37,290
He was Lord Bucky!

741
01:01:39,670 --> 01:01:44,110
It was, it's like Widow was just a troll pic who would have thought.

742
01:01:46,090 --> 01:01:46,750
No way!

743
01:01:47,290 --> 01:01:48,190
No way!

744
01:01:48,630 --> 01:01:49,590
That can't be!

745
01:01:56,970 --> 01:02:00,870
What was that Widow player in the, in the beginning of season that was so good?

746
01:02:00,950 --> 01:02:02,530
I swear I don't see that guy anymore.

747
01:02:02,970 --> 01:02:03,770
Oh, go bevels.

748
01:02:04,330 --> 01:02:07,810
There used to be a Widow player that was like really, really, really good.

749
01:02:09,790 --> 01:02:10,670
Um, not...

750
01:02:11,170 --> 01:02:12,770
That streams a lot too.

751
01:02:13,710 --> 01:02:14,350
No, not Peril.

752
01:02:14,570 --> 01:02:15,510
Apparently she was hacking.

753
01:02:17,270 --> 01:02:18,990
I don't know, this is all...

754
01:02:18,990 --> 01:02:21,430
It's all, um...

755
01:02:22,330 --> 01:02:23,210
Sweet shit!

756
01:02:24,490 --> 01:02:26,910
It's all, but like, he got banned and then he disappeared.

757
01:02:33,030 --> 01:02:34,050
Why not Peril?

758
01:02:35,290 --> 01:02:36,250
He's all together.

759
01:02:37,090 --> 01:02:38,150
Apparently, but it's all...

760
01:02:38,170 --> 01:03:05,050
like what's the word it's like um i guess like hearsay from other players other pro players we're seeing it i8 yeah yeah i8 i was thinking about i8 speculations yeah from paros but like apparently what from what i was told he got banned and then he like never came back but people don't know i don't know i don't know he just literally disappeared i don't see him

761
01:03:08,170 --> 01:03:08,850
see him anymore.

762
01:03:12,050 --> 01:03:13,010
Oh my god.

763
01:03:13,530 --> 01:03:16,670
I'm just gonna...

764
01:03:17,490 --> 01:03:17,970
Um...

765
01:03:18,750 --> 01:03:20,470
I might be this.

766
01:03:23,630 --> 01:03:24,750
Whoa, shit, nice.

767
01:03:26,550 --> 01:03:27,510
I mean, I can still get there.

768
01:03:28,830 --> 01:03:31,810
I mean, I don't see him anymore either, so like, I don't know.

769
01:03:34,030 --> 01:03:36,970
I personally haven't seen for, uh, since I've been playing again.

770
01:03:36,970 --> 01:03:38,990
at all on my friends list.

771
01:03:40,170 --> 01:03:42,050
So, or maybe name change, who knows?

772
01:03:42,710 --> 01:03:44,510
But like I said, it's all like speculations.

773
01:03:45,330 --> 01:03:47,310
But I was told from like other players.

774
01:03:48,170 --> 01:03:48,170
Oh,

775
01:03:53,390 --> 01:03:55,250
we win this.

776
01:03:55,550 --> 01:03:55,910
Okay.

777
01:03:57,370 --> 01:04:01,010
I don't know, I thought we were gonna fight here.

778
01:04:03,190 --> 01:04:04,510
This is a little bad.

779
01:04:05,430 --> 01:04:07,650
Because I have four, three.

780
01:04:08,690 --> 01:04:09,210
Okay.

781
01:04:10,250 --> 01:04:12,050
Oh my god, that's so unlucky.

782
01:04:13,150 --> 01:04:14,350
He died so fast.

783
01:04:15,750 --> 01:04:18,250
Because they have...

784
01:04:18,790 --> 01:04:20,330
They have like, uh...

785
01:04:22,510 --> 01:04:24,250
This is bad because...

786
01:04:25,970 --> 01:04:27,510
Oh, this is so bad.

787
01:04:31,210 --> 01:04:32,830
He's won, he's actually won.

788
01:04:37,230 --> 01:04:38,430
Oh my god, I'm so sad.

789
01:04:38,710 --> 01:04:38,930
Oh!

790
01:04:39,710 --> 01:04:40,770
Oh, yes!

791
01:04:41,070 --> 01:04:41,610
C9!

792
01:04:41,830 --> 01:04:42,270
Sorry, C9!

793
01:04:42,290 --> 01:04:43,290
Send nine.

794
01:04:51,750 --> 01:04:52,530
Send nine.

795
01:04:55,310 --> 01:04:57,090
The new C9.

796
01:05:00,350 --> 01:05:02,530
Oh, he did it like, what, two times?

797
01:05:02,790 --> 01:05:04,050
Two times back to back?

798
01:05:04,730 --> 01:05:05,730
Or was it three times?

799
01:05:05,810 --> 01:05:06,110
I don't remember.

800
01:05:06,170 --> 01:05:06,610
I lost count.

801
01:05:07,330 --> 01:05:08,670
I saw that live, too.

802
01:05:09,090 --> 01:05:10,730
I saw that live.

803
01:05:11,450 --> 01:05:27,270
People were like, Mark, I saw Rob Moore, like, put his hands on his head, like, you know, like, like, you know, like, crouch, bent down, with his palm, with his palm in his, like, in his head.

804
01:05:28,070 --> 01:05:32,390
I saw that when that happened.

805
01:05:46,700 --> 01:05:48,460
I'm not a Loki, babe.

806
01:05:48,560 --> 01:05:49,420
I'm trying my best.

807
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:53,940
I am ready to put on a show.

808
01:05:55,300 --> 01:05:55,940
I really don't.

809
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:56,640
He sucks.

810
01:05:57,460 --> 01:05:59,300
And do a storm up.

811
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:01,380
So I'm trying my best.

812
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:04,440
No, we're dead.

813
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:06,140
We're so dead.

814
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:07,080
I don't know if I can.

815
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:11,840
Oh, we seen we said nine.

816
01:06:12,380 --> 01:06:13,760
I literally was so close.

817
01:06:17,060 --> 01:06:18,060
It's 97.

818
01:06:20,660 --> 01:06:23,240
Damn, said nine.

819
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:24,980
They said nine.

820
01:06:25,420 --> 01:06:26,420
We said nine.

821
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:28,900
Oh, it's a back-to-back said nine.

822
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:44,200
I gotta try to put the gloaky cone there.

823
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:47,320
I was like, I was so close.

824
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:48,540
I was 2%, 2%.

825
01:06:51,020 --> 01:06:52,100
Mutual send 9.

826
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:55,460
Dude, you stop making send 9, I think.

827
01:07:00,360 --> 01:07:00,760
Okay.

828
01:07:01,780 --> 01:07:02,580
Didn't like...

829
01:07:02,580 --> 01:07:03,680
Okay, for...

830
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:06,480
I think like, what, Cloud 9 when it happened in Overwatch?

831
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:08,320
Um...

832
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:09,500
It happened like how many times?

833
01:07:09,580 --> 01:07:10,500
I think it was like...

834
01:07:11,420 --> 01:07:13,320
Okay, to be fair, when Cloud...

835
01:07:13,320 --> 01:07:15,540
I remember because I was like during the Overwatch days.

836
01:07:15,880 --> 01:08:08,940
while oh when because I watched the I actually watched the tournament when it happened but I think it also happened twice I'm pretty sure it happened twice and um and yeah no for cloud nine that's why it was called c9 because it happened it but it was in Korea it was in Korea and it wasn't even like a big tournament for it so that's why like everyone's calling it said 9 because it's like you know it's it's a new it's for the new generation because like because like c9 is for the older older overwatch generation and now that we're in marvel rivals it should be called 79 now no lambs i have to use this we don't have lambs either

837
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:14,280
Okay.

838
01:08:15,640 --> 01:08:16,660
Oh my god, the reload.

839
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:20,260
I'm missing and I have to reload.

840
01:08:21,360 --> 01:08:24,600
I panic a lot when I'm fucking playing Loki though, not gonna lie.

841
01:08:28,140 --> 01:08:30,580
I don't know, Loki is scarier.

842
01:08:30,820 --> 01:08:34,660
It's so much more pressure to play compared to Luna.

843
01:08:35,420 --> 01:08:40,140
I think it's because I'm not as comfortable on Loki as I am on the other supports.

844
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:42,480
Which he's so strong.

845
01:08:43,680 --> 01:09:03,020
is definitely one by weaker weakest please please please oh my god okay i hope she i still die

846
01:09:08,430 --> 01:09:20,910
oh phoenix all the fat that was a huge combo trying to dodge three things can't get any help It was impossible.

847
01:09:22,350 --> 01:09:23,150
It was three alts.

848
01:09:23,450 --> 01:09:24,610
There was nothing we could do.

849
01:09:24,910 --> 01:09:26,830
They literally Phoenix alts in my lamp away.

850
01:09:33,570 --> 01:09:36,810
I don't know why I couldn't copy Luna there.

851
01:09:37,350 --> 01:09:39,590
I was literally just trying to spam coffee but it didn't work.

852
01:09:40,270 --> 01:09:41,750
And it gave me Bucky too.

853
01:09:44,450 --> 01:09:47,690
It fucking gave me Bucky instead of...

854
01:09:47,690 --> 01:09:49,310
Instead of fucking Luna.

855
01:09:51,290 --> 01:09:52,370
Just kill him.

856
01:09:54,870 --> 01:10:10,810
I have many faces I don't have to copy Also like I'm Apparently I'm supposed to copy first I have to Loki is first And everything But it's just so stressful Because it's like when do I copy

857
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:28,360
It's definitely harder No I do I do have double confirm I had double confirm but like for some reason Because I almost I almost copied Uh Okay, don't worry, I got you.

858
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:30,160
I am ready to put on a show!

859
01:10:30,540 --> 01:10:32,820
I am ready to put on a show!

860
01:10:33,540 --> 01:10:36,840
Oh my god, I did.

861
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:39,320
Alright.

862
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:44,120
It's fine.

863
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:45,100
We're okay.

864
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:47,960
This Hulk is a fucking terrorist.

865
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:52,620
He's using every cooldown on me.

866
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:54,480
Damn.

867
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:55,660
That's rough, buddy.

868
01:10:57,700 --> 01:10:58,630
That's fucking rough.

869
01:11:02,140 --> 01:11:02,160
Yay.

870
01:11:03,060 --> 01:11:04,320
They're on four supports.

871
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:06,120
Yeah.

872
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:09,480
Okay, I was like...

873
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:11,040
No.

874
01:11:14,380 --> 01:11:17,800
I had to look back because I was like, what?

875
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:24,260
Look, see?

876
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:25,320
It works.

877
01:11:26,420 --> 01:11:27,340
I did it.

878
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:30,040
Damage boost that.

879
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:30,780
Damage boost that.

880
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:33,820
Oh, never mind.

881
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:37,540
You want to get healed so...

882
01:11:37,540 --> 01:11:38,820
I was like, no way.

883
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:39,960
Boy.

884
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:41,980
No, you're fucking with me.

885
01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:44,600
That doesn't sound right.

886
01:11:46,020 --> 01:11:47,880
I don't know if I'm going to build ult in time, though.

887
01:11:52,060 --> 01:11:54,420
Well, all the meta supports, Loki is my weakest.

888
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:57,580
Because normally I'm not put on Loki duty too.

889
01:11:57,880 --> 01:12:02,480
Because like, um, because Loki is like, a lot of people like playing Loki.

890
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:05,600
So like, I never have to play Loki in general.

891
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:12,040
Oh my gosh, I have to use that.

892
01:12:12,040 --> 01:12:13,820
I am ready to put on a show.

893
01:12:17,080 --> 01:12:19,020
I am ready to put on a show.

894
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:20,620
I have to use that.

895
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:22,900
Our team was dying.

896
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:24,400
Oh.

897
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:27,260
I am ready to put on a show.

898
01:12:28,220 --> 01:12:28,820
Wait, what?

899
01:12:29,020 --> 01:12:30,380
Oh, it's two support olds.

900
01:12:30,820 --> 01:12:32,520
I was like, what the fuck?

901
01:12:35,260 --> 01:12:35,800
Oh, nice.

902
01:12:36,300 --> 01:12:36,900
Bye, bye, bye.

903
01:12:37,740 --> 01:12:38,080
Yay!

904
01:12:38,680 --> 01:12:39,480
Damage boost!

905
01:12:41,540 --> 01:12:44,200
Baby, damage boost to Phoenix salt, you kill everything.

906
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:46,940
It's okay.

907
01:12:47,060 --> 01:12:48,440
Maybe they do need a force support.

908
01:12:50,220 --> 01:12:50,740
All right.

909
01:12:50,940 --> 01:12:52,000
Oh my god, one more minute.

910
01:12:52,140 --> 01:12:54,460
I feel like I'm even in this fight.

911
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:55,640
for like 20 years.

912
01:12:57,860 --> 01:12:58,440
Yay!

913
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:04,540
Dance, dance, dance, dance, do the snow.

914
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:08,080
Bum, bum, bum.

915
01:13:08,280 --> 01:13:08,940
What the fuck?

916
01:13:09,020 --> 01:13:09,860
Why did he came over?

917
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:12,420
Oh, oh, no.

918
01:13:14,440 --> 01:13:15,640
Don't worry, I'm helping.

919
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:18,100
There you go.

920
01:13:18,820 --> 01:13:20,720
Oh, he could have stayed in my thing.

921
01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:21,780
That's okay.

922
01:13:23,700 --> 01:13:24,280
Yay!

923
01:13:25,620 --> 01:13:26,460
Hey, Luna.

924
01:13:26,920 --> 01:13:28,120
Can you heal me too?

925
01:13:28,460 --> 01:13:30,140
I just need one little healer.

926
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:31,860
Because I'm greedy as fuck.

927
01:13:33,160 --> 01:13:36,080
Okay, this Hulk is actually pretty bad.

928
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:40,800
Hulk is not meta, but for some reason, Celestia, everybody wants to play Hulk.

929
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:42,540
And I don't know why.

930
01:13:43,660 --> 01:13:45,040
Everyone's obsessed with Hulk.

931
01:13:49,580 --> 01:13:51,520
Okay, um, I think we're fine.

932
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:53,280
Fuck on us.

933
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:55,080
Don't worry.

934
01:13:55,260 --> 01:13:56,560
Hulk is on me now.

935
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:57,840
Oh, fucking okay.

936
01:13:58,360 --> 01:13:58,940
Don't worry.

937
01:13:59,240 --> 01:13:59,960
I'm still alive.

938
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:09,360
Oh, don't worry I don't know how I live Where is he?

939
01:14:10,040 --> 01:14:19,800
Come on Kobe Oh shit Hello Oh my god in my little safe space.

940
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:20,160
I

941
01:14:24,140 --> 01:14:25,860
Oh my god!

942
01:14:26,420 --> 01:14:29,220
Oh my god, my little safe space!

943
01:14:30,040 --> 01:14:30,900
The cup leaf!

944
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:34,720
I'm glad that, um...

945
01:14:35,420 --> 01:14:38,020
The mag fucking saved us there.

946
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:40,980
I just have to be in the little house.

947
01:14:42,740 --> 01:14:44,980
Oh my god, we haven't hit Doom.

948
01:14:45,100 --> 01:14:47,260
Yeah, my little bunker, I bunkered up.

949
01:14:48,760 --> 01:14:49,740
Get to cover!

950
01:14:50,380 --> 01:14:51,740
Two, one!

951
01:14:53,280 --> 01:15:21,660
Yeah, mag closed the door for me, but Because I was thinking I was like, wait, no, we're gonna die and there's no like I was like Mag could just chuck this fucking ball into our house and then thank god mag was there Thank god mag was there to like To close that door We did it we overcame the loser queue

952
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:50,740
nice keep eating the dicks why is he complaining you don't have to you don't have pussy travesty keep spamming cooldowns that's the point of abilities keep eating dicks yay i'm the heart sucks celestial three let's go

953
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:54,920
Not pussy.

954
01:15:55,940 --> 01:15:56,220
Yay!

955
01:15:58,300 --> 01:15:58,800
Wow.

956
01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:01,980
Can't wait to lose all my games after this.

957
01:16:05,940 --> 01:16:06,860
I think Celestia...

958
01:16:06,860 --> 01:16:09,820
Okay, I think High Elo starts at Celestia 1, though.

959
01:16:10,860 --> 01:16:12,000
Not that Loki game.

960
01:16:12,380 --> 01:16:15,200
Loki is my weakest support, I think.

961
01:16:15,560 --> 01:16:16,000
Out of...

962
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,220
Well, we don't count the non-meta.

963
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:19,660
Because Sue's not meta anymore.

964
01:16:20,440 --> 01:16:22,880
But I still think I'm better at Sue than Loki.

965
01:16:22,880 --> 01:17:50,120
uh apparently jeff is meta but only in scrims only in tournament play um i'm better at adam than i am on loki adam is so easy to play what's meta from what i know it's luna loki um cloak if loki is banned and for like certain maps sue apparently is not meta anymore because she got like she kept she got slowly nerfed over time um ultron is meta during triple support uh mantis is triple support as well for situational for uh triple support rocket is absolutely dog shit and that will always be dog shit um but uh but i would say like because loki is hard meta and a really good loki player is um then why did you why did you play rock because whenever i'm lazy and I don't want to try um literally literally you don't need hands to play rocket all I have to do is pressed is like I don't remember is it left click or right click that's you all I have to do is just press right click I don't even remember which one's the heel press right click and just stand there sometimes I put e out if I feel a

966
01:17:50,120 --> 01:17:53,200
little um a little wild I'm not putting my E out.

967
01:17:57,620 --> 01:17:58,060
Um.

968
01:18:01,180 --> 01:18:07,880
But yeah, no, like, Rocket is literally, like, if you just don't feel like actually playing the game, and you just want to AFK, you just play Rocket.

969
01:18:08,140 --> 01:18:11,560
If you, like, like the game, but you don't want to try anymore, you play Rocket.

970
01:18:11,980 --> 01:18:13,420
But Loki is hard meta.

971
01:18:13,460 --> 01:18:16,100
A good Loki player is so fucking scary.

972
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:18,320
Like, um, the things they can do.

973
01:18:18,680 --> 01:18:21,780
Loki is actually a fucking mind game playing him.

974
01:18:21,880 --> 01:18:24,160
Because you have to be more aware of your cooldowns.

975
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:28,600
Demon, thank you for the 200 bitties.

976
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:29,840
Thank you, thank you.

977
01:18:29,960 --> 01:18:30,880
What the fuck?

978
01:18:31,020 --> 01:18:32,220
An eternity player.

979
01:18:32,940 --> 01:18:34,080
What he's doing here.

980
01:18:34,240 --> 01:18:34,880
I found your immediate one.

981
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:37,360
Pop in and say, I absolutely love your mind and voice.

982
01:18:37,560 --> 01:18:38,000
Thank you.

983
01:18:38,100 --> 01:18:39,020
I appreciate it.

984
01:18:39,140 --> 01:18:39,820
I'm going to get a good week.

985
01:18:39,900 --> 01:18:40,780
Lots of love from chat.

986
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:41,480
Thank you again.

987
01:18:41,540 --> 01:18:42,860
Thank you for those 200 bitties.

988
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:48,160
So sometimes I don't want to try and play.

989
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:48,480
Yay.

990
01:18:48,700 --> 01:18:48,880
See?

991
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:50,040
Someone else can play Loki.

992
01:18:51,880 --> 01:18:52,820
to try sometimes.

993
01:18:53,140 --> 01:18:54,580
I just want to relax and chill.

994
01:18:57,730 --> 01:19:00,110
Who am I going to banish from this match?

995
01:19:01,830 --> 01:19:02,210
Alright.

996
01:19:03,130 --> 01:19:04,370
What are we going to do now?

997
01:19:08,100 --> 01:19:08,660
Up, up.

998
01:19:09,060 --> 01:19:10,700
Apparently you can't three stack on.

999
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:20,500
Apparently, uh, uh, you can't, uh, uh, do more than duos now in Celestia.

1000
01:19:21,160 --> 01:19:23,260
They, like, restricted it for Celestia now.

1001
01:19:23,560 --> 01:19:24,540
It should be eternity.

1002
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,240
Yeah, you can't even three stack in Celestia.

1003
01:19:29,660 --> 01:19:30,520
Oh, we all banned it.

1004
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:31,480
I'm banning Torch.

1005
01:19:31,640 --> 01:19:32,380
Fuck that shit.

1006
01:19:33,100 --> 01:19:34,320
Torch is, like, so fucking broken.

1007
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:37,380
Apparently, Torch and Seiloc are the most broken characters right now.

1008
01:19:37,860 --> 01:19:42,080
I mean, I think Seiloc basically gets the Juno treatment.

1009
01:19:42,840 --> 01:19:45,160
Where she gets every fucking skin possible.

1010
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:46,440
Oh, no, that's Spider-Man.

1011
01:19:46,540 --> 01:19:47,360
Sorry, Spider-Man.

1012
01:19:47,720 --> 01:19:49,300
No, Spider-Man is Kiriko.

1013
01:19:49,880 --> 01:19:53,720
And, um, and Seiloc is, uh, Jun...

1014
01:19:53,720 --> 01:19:54,920
Spider-Man is Kiriko.

1015
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,500
in terms of, like, Kyoko gets nothing other than skins.

1016
01:19:59,100 --> 01:20:03,940
And Scyloc is Juno, where she can get buff and also get the skins.

1017
01:20:05,880 --> 01:20:08,860
Like, she doesn't get touched for nerfs or buffs.

1018
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:14,900
Oh, am I lagging now?

1019
01:20:16,580 --> 01:20:17,000
Really?

1020
01:20:18,440 --> 01:20:20,840
If I tap out, if I tap out, I lag.

1021
01:20:24,900 --> 01:20:26,540
It's only when I tap out.

1022
01:20:30,950 --> 01:20:32,330
Luna is a new Kiriko.

1023
01:20:32,550 --> 01:20:34,390
No, because Luna skins are fucking dog shit.

1024
01:20:34,910 --> 01:20:35,890
You can't change my mind.

1025
01:20:36,330 --> 01:20:40,770
I think all Luna skins are ugly except for the default.

1026
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:50,940
Lower accurate spot events.

1027
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:56,480
I hate every Luna skin except for the default one.

1028
01:20:57,860 --> 01:21:00,800
You guys think it's good only because she's showing ass.

1029
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:05,570
Like, fucking, if she's she what if her ass wasn't showing you would think the skin is dog shit

1030
01:21:10,080 --> 01:22:01,660
yeah and if her ass was covered you would not think this is a good skin it's literally because your ass is showing i think the skin has only redeeming quality is the fact that it's a skin there's nothing else to redeem it okay what the fuck is there oh yeah I forgot to put it on a Captain America you're supposed to put the snowflake on your Captain America and then they'll live forever and can do like Captain America things like that yeah help her Loki more I have to reload,

1031
01:22:01,820 --> 01:22:02,940
so I hope he lives.

1032
01:22:07,900 --> 01:22:08,480
I like it for...

1033
01:22:08,480 --> 01:22:09,300
I think her hair...

1034
01:22:09,300 --> 01:22:10,940
I don't like her hair for it either.

1035
01:22:11,880 --> 01:22:12,220
I personally...

1036
01:22:12,220 --> 01:22:15,620
I don't like the hairstyle and the hair colors on all the alternatives.

1037
01:22:16,380 --> 01:22:17,040
I don't know.

1038
01:22:17,420 --> 01:22:18,400
Her default one was just...

1039
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:19,220
It's just so good.

1040
01:22:19,720 --> 01:22:21,340
That it's hard to make a better Luna skin.

1041
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:26,600
90% of Luna skin has her ass covered.

1042
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:31,000
That's why everyone thinks the bikini one is the best one.

1043
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:35,340
If she didn't have her ass showing, you would all think it's not a great skin.

1044
01:22:38,640 --> 01:22:40,660
You can not change my mind.

1045
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:43,500
I would say it.

1046
01:22:52,470 --> 01:22:55,450
Oh my god, please just, okay, thank god.

1047
01:22:55,810 --> 01:22:56,330
Kill him.

1048
01:23:03,860 --> 01:23:04,980
Kill him.

1049
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:06,000
Not me.

1050
01:23:07,800 --> 01:23:09,480
Her feet are also, yeah, exactly.

1051
01:23:09,640 --> 01:23:11,340
Her feet is also showing.

1052
01:23:15,860 --> 01:23:20,940
It's just the fucking, uh, it's just like everything about it.

1053
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:30,160
I love shooting random breezes and then...

1054
01:23:34,160 --> 01:23:36,060
Okay, let's hope that...

1055
01:23:36,060 --> 01:23:37,420
Oh, he missed.

1056
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:38,720
That's...

1057
01:23:38,720 --> 01:23:43,060
I mean, that's fine with me.

1058
01:23:43,460 --> 01:23:44,980
I'm fine with that.

1059
01:23:46,080 --> 01:23:47,060
I'm actually fine.

1060
01:23:47,100 --> 01:23:48,340
I didn't have to use it.

1061
01:23:48,460 --> 01:23:49,820
I just, I don't know.

1062
01:23:51,560 --> 01:23:53,580
I just felt like it.

1063
01:23:53,860 --> 01:23:56,580
Oh my god, I hope you like...

1064
01:23:57,660 --> 01:23:58,100
Okay.

1065
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:00,600
That should not have hit.

1066
01:24:00,700 --> 01:24:02,060
I was not on it.

1067
01:24:02,580 --> 01:24:06,920
The freeze, I was saying, the freeze was absolutely not on that mag.

1068
01:24:07,080 --> 01:24:09,160
I have no idea how I got it.

1069
01:24:12,360 --> 01:24:13,820
Yeah, yeah, it missed.

1070
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:15,140
It was a miss.

1071
01:24:15,200 --> 01:24:15,760
I was like, okay.

1072
01:24:15,780 --> 01:24:18,100
Okay, I'll take it.

1073
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:21,200
We take this.

1074
01:24:23,700 --> 01:24:25,280
We take it.

1075
01:24:26,120 --> 01:24:27,220
Heroes make them safe.

1076
01:24:28,140 --> 01:24:29,680
There's a lot like here.

1077
01:24:29,880 --> 01:24:31,020
There's a lot to like here.

1078
01:24:31,080 --> 01:24:34,560
There's a little something for everyone except for Toki.

1079
01:24:37,700 --> 01:24:39,440
30 seconds before you attack.

1080
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:41,600
I'm more than just a gooner, guys.

1081
01:24:43,980 --> 01:24:45,640
There's more to this world.

1082
01:24:45,780 --> 01:24:47,280
than gooning.

1083
01:24:58,060 --> 01:25:01,300
I will say the Scylok skin is a good skin.

1084
01:25:02,040 --> 01:25:03,820
The swimsuit one is good.

1085
01:25:04,520 --> 01:25:05,980
Not just because of her ass.

1086
01:25:06,080 --> 01:25:09,320
It's because of everything that combined together.

1087
01:25:09,540 --> 01:25:10,320
It makes it a good...

1088
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:13,120
It makes it a good quality gooner skin.

1089
01:25:18,070 --> 01:25:32,710
It's a set pleasing and you can goon to it like that's what we're here for it luna is like the low effort goon can

1090
01:25:40,990 --> 01:25:59,510

1091
01:26:00,070 --> 01:26:02,950
Thank God they don't know we fucked up our Loki coffee.

1092
01:26:10,330 --> 01:26:13,630
They didn't know we fucked up our Loki coffee.

1093
01:26:14,310 --> 01:26:15,650
We take those.

1094
01:26:19,500 --> 01:26:20,700
Never punished.

1095
01:26:21,880 --> 01:26:24,600
The Loki thanking God right now.

1096
01:26:25,020 --> 01:26:25,460
He didn't.

1097
01:26:25,820 --> 01:26:26,100
Yay!

1098
01:26:35,040 --> 01:26:35,480
Yippee!

1099
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:37,920
No punishment.

1100
01:26:38,320 --> 01:26:38,540
Yeah.

1101
01:26:40,020 --> 01:26:41,300
We're doing it, guys.

1102
01:26:41,500 --> 01:26:42,400
We're actually doing it.

1103
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:44,140
I'm going to say that, and then we're going to start losing now.

1104
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:45,860
I mean, it's a nice record.

1105
01:26:46,520 --> 01:26:48,360
It's a pretty decent record here.

1106
01:26:50,760 --> 01:26:51,000
Oh.

1107
01:26:51,640 --> 01:26:53,460
No, how would I roll this?

1108
01:26:56,300 --> 01:26:57,200
Today on Twitch.

1109
01:26:57,300 --> 01:26:58,620
I just felt like playing Rylos today.

1110
01:26:59,580 --> 01:27:00,340
That's really it.

1111
01:27:00,940 --> 01:27:06,400
I was craving some rank, and I was like, I play off stream when I can just when I'm going to stream it.

1112
01:27:07,280 --> 01:27:09,180
Be more fun for you guys to watch anyway.

1113
01:27:10,980 --> 01:27:11,720
Can anyone else please?

1114
01:27:12,420 --> 01:27:12,480
Oh.

1115
01:27:13,480 --> 01:27:14,240
I'm Luna Snow.

1116
01:27:15,060 --> 01:27:17,380
Like the moon, I shine in darkness.

1117
01:27:19,120 --> 01:27:20,740
Huey, thank you for the 200 videos.

1118
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:21,500
Thank you, thank you.

1119
01:27:21,560 --> 01:27:24,240
If justify your gooning, then you aren't a real gooner.

1120
01:27:24,580 --> 01:27:26,000
Thank you for the super chat.

1121
01:27:27,280 --> 01:27:27,720

You have bad preferences.

1126
01:28:10,520 --> 01:28:15,200
Maddie, as soon as Gripproos are shown, you don't even care what they look like.

1127
01:28:20,460 --> 01:28:22,520
Right heroes could make all the difference.

1128
01:28:28,950 --> 01:28:30,370
Bro, God, God.

1129
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:41,080
It's okay we ban.

1130
01:28:41,200 --> 01:28:43,620
So Venom doesn't get railed.

1133
01:29:14,120 --> 01:29:16,380
And not three DPS.

1134
01:29:16,860 --> 01:29:18,460
Guys, we're in Loser Q now.

1135
01:29:24,220 --> 01:29:27,560
Yeah, I'd rather have no Torch Player than an actual Torch Player.

1136
01:29:29,120 --> 01:29:30,600
Some DPS drop.

1137
01:29:30,860 --> 01:29:31,660
Oh, there we go.

1138
01:29:32,780 --> 01:29:33,880
We got Rocket.

1139
01:29:34,440 --> 01:29:34,660
Alright.

1140
01:29:35,200 --> 01:29:35,480
Alright.

1141
01:29:35,880 --> 01:29:36,740
We're gonna lose.

1142
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:38,240
Alright.

1143
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:43,280

Such a bad character.

1146
01:30:19,320 --> 01:30:21,720
He's so lucky I was looking at him.

1147
01:30:23,740 --> 01:30:25,080
Oh my god.

1148
01:30:25,660 --> 01:30:27,300
We're getting harassed by...

1149
01:30:27,300 --> 01:30:29,800
This Captain America doesn't even have a snowflake, so he should not be living.

1150
01:30:30,720 --> 01:30:33,320
I think this is the same Captain America from...

1151
01:30:33,320 --> 01:30:34,980
The last game.

1152
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:39,380
A good Captain America is so scary.

1153
01:30:40,240 --> 01:30:42,440
Oh, stack, stack, stack.

1154
01:30:43,020 --> 01:30:43,420
Rocket!

1155
01:30:43,720 --> 01:30:44,760
Why did you leave?

1156
01:30:45,140 --> 01:30:46,680
The circle!

1157
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:47,600
Wait!

1158
01:30:49,360 --> 01:30:50,080
See it!

1159
01:30:50,100 --> 01:30:51,720
Yeah, no, my hate is justified.

1160
01:30:52,060 --> 01:30:53,800
He literally walked out!

1161
01:30:55,040 --> 01:30:58,340
If he stayed, I could have lived!

1162
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,140
Get away from me.

1163
01:31:07,180 --> 01:31:10,080
His fucking walks, walks away.

1164
01:31:12,820 --> 01:31:13,960
I don't!

1165
01:31:14,180 --> 01:31:15,080
Okay, thank you.

1166
01:31:15,140 --> 01:31:16,460
Thank you.

1167
01:31:16,900 --> 01:31:20,140
Also, the reason why is also because, like, um...

1168
01:31:23,640 --> 01:31:24,240
Um...

1169
01:31:24,240 --> 01:31:24,860
How's it say?

1170
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:30,140
It's easier to pocket the other support during...

1171
01:31:31,320 --> 01:31:35,300
Oh my gosh, I reflexively do it because I heard, like, the voice line.

1172
01:31:36,160 --> 01:31:36,720
Um...

1173
01:31:38,040 --> 01:31:39,120
I got it!

1174
01:31:39,300 --> 01:31:39,760
He's done!

1175
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:41,460
It's easier to pocket.

1176
01:31:44,380 --> 01:31:44,980
Okay.

1177
01:31:46,380 --> 01:31:50,740
It's a lot easier to pocket the other support when they're not...

1178
01:31:51,260 --> 01:31:52,400
when they're not Rocket.

1179
01:31:53,120 --> 01:31:54,740
Rocket is very bad at pocketing.

1180
01:31:57,320 --> 01:31:58,120
Holy shit.

1181
01:31:58,980 --> 01:32:00,220
Okay, we're still fighting this.

1182
01:32:00,320 --> 01:32:02,760
I can go Loki and...

1183
01:32:05,800 --> 01:32:06,280
Okay.

1184
01:32:06,900 --> 01:32:07,920
I have to use that.

1185
01:32:11,530 --> 01:32:12,390
Oh my god, please Rocket.

1186
01:32:12,810 --> 01:32:13,110
Play!

1187
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:19,500
Because Rocket players just play for their life.

1188
01:32:19,580 --> 01:32:20,100
They don't.

1189
01:32:20,400 --> 01:32:23,400
Play for, like, Assists.

1190
01:32:24,840 --> 01:32:26,120
Like, I literally can't live.

1191
01:32:29,760 --> 01:32:31,200
I cannot live.

1192
01:32:32,620 --> 01:32:35,400
Because the Captain America will just chase me the entire time.

1193
01:32:36,720 --> 01:32:39,040
The Captain America will just chase me all the time.

1194
01:32:39,480 --> 01:32:43,200
And because he'll chase me, since I'm an easier target, I'll just keep dying.

1195
01:32:43,320 --> 01:32:44,880
Because the rocket cannot pocket me.

1196
01:32:45,460 --> 01:32:46,840
Or, like, support me through it.

1197
01:32:48,860 --> 01:32:50,380
This is why rocket is a bad fit.

1198
01:32:50,400 --> 01:33:13,140
like it's just so like i just have to fucking run away and pretend that i don't exist oh yeah that sucks doesn't it yeah that fucking sucks man yeah my god wow doesn't that fucking suck rocket it sure does

1199
01:33:21,800 --> 01:33:24,120
That fucking suck, doesn't it?

1200
01:33:24,580 --> 01:33:25,200
Oh my god.

1201
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:28,000
Oh my please, I literally...

1202
01:33:36,560 --> 01:33:39,100
Oh my god, I wish I could just copy...

1203
01:33:42,320 --> 01:33:42,840
Okay.

1204
01:33:42,900 --> 01:33:44,420
I'm ready to put on a show.

1205
01:33:48,860 --> 01:33:51,560
Oh my god, I can't do anything!

1206
01:33:54,180 --> 01:33:54,660
Please!

1207
01:33:57,380 --> 01:34:00,220
I can't fucking survive!

1208
01:34:00,840 --> 01:34:01,660
I can't copy Luna.

1209
01:34:02,380 --> 01:34:06,060
The Luna was not in my, like, line of sight.

1210
01:34:09,160 --> 01:34:12,020
I want to copy Luna, but he wasn't in my line of sight.

1211
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:17,780
I'm not gonna... yeah, fuck it.

1212
01:34:18,020 --> 01:34:21,680
Can you, like, go back out and just sit in our back line?

1213
01:34:25,160 --> 01:34:25,720
I...

1214
01:34:26,480 --> 01:34:27,780
I can't even shift.

1215
01:34:28,720 --> 01:34:30,020
I can't even shift.

1216
01:34:31,240 --> 01:34:33,740
Literally no backline support.

1217
01:34:37,400 --> 01:34:39,220
Please, I just want to copy.

1218
01:34:39,740 --> 01:34:41,000
I just want to copy.

1219
01:34:41,160 --> 01:34:42,240
That's all I want to do.

1220
01:34:42,380 --> 01:34:44,280
Let me copy something.

1221
01:34:48,080 --> 01:34:49,420
Oh my god.

1222
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:53,020
Okay, that's fine.

1223
01:34:53,700 --> 01:34:55,680
This is a- this is a- this is fine.

1224
01:34:56,120 --> 01:34:57,020
I'm not copying, dude.

1225
01:34:57,140 --> 01:34:58,280
I can't- I can't risk it.

1226
01:35:00,040 --> 01:35:01,820
I can't fucking risk it.

1227
01:35:08,300 --> 01:35:09,720
Wait, what the fuck?

1228
01:35:09,840 --> 01:35:10,900
Who's shooting at us?

1229
01:35:13,500 --> 01:35:14,980
Something is hitting us.

1230
01:35:15,700 --> 01:35:16,580
I don't like it.

1231
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:22,540
I normally don't play Doki on this map, so I'm, like, struggling.

1232
01:35:25,620 --> 01:35:28,500
I'm actually struggling so much when I'm getting dead.

1233
01:35:37,680 --> 01:35:39,480
Oh my god.

1234
01:35:44,260 --> 01:35:46,200
Oh my god.

1235
01:35:48,680 --> 01:35:49,960
Don't fuck this.

1236
01:35:50,900 --> 01:35:51,520
I can't.

1237
01:35:52,960 --> 01:35:54,340
I literally can't do anything.

1238
01:35:56,620 --> 01:35:59,060
That, like I said, it's a struggle.

1239
01:36:04,660 --> 01:36:06,680
That's the only thing I can do.

1240
01:36:07,820 --> 01:36:09,400
I'm just gonna stay up here.

1241
01:36:09,880 --> 01:36:13,500
It can't hurt me.

1242
01:36:14,940 --> 01:36:16,740
I am ready to put on a show.

1243
01:36:17,260 --> 01:36:18,240
I can't.

1244
01:36:22,440 --> 01:36:24,000
Good luck, everybody.

1245
01:36:27,620 --> 01:36:29,160
Good luck, everyone.

1246
01:36:30,500 --> 01:36:30,940
Maybe?

1247
01:36:31,540 --> 01:36:34,340
I have many faces Okay

1248
01:36:40,200 --> 01:36:43,360
Okay Okay

1249
01:36:53,460 --> 01:37:08,720
Just run away Time to search things up Including which side you're on Please leave me He is low.

1250
01:37:11,840 --> 01:37:14,740
He said not just to kill me.

1251
01:37:14,880 --> 01:37:15,820
That's so fucked.

1252
01:37:17,040 --> 01:37:18,240
That's so fucked.

1253
01:37:19,040 --> 01:37:21,520
He actually left the point just to kill me.

1254
01:37:23,900 --> 01:37:25,740
Thank you for the red.

1255
01:37:25,900 --> 01:37:26,160
Thank you.

1256
01:37:26,500 --> 01:37:26,940
Thank you.

1257
01:37:27,140 --> 01:37:28,140
Now we had a good stream.

1258
01:37:29,220 --> 01:37:30,440
Oh yeah, I am lagging a little.

1259
01:37:31,800 --> 01:37:31,820
Wow.

1260
01:37:32,280 --> 01:37:33,120
I don't know why.

1261
01:37:39,350 --> 01:37:39,910
120.

1262
01:37:41,010 --> 01:37:44,050
Oh my gosh, this is why.

1263
01:37:46,830 --> 01:37:49,170
Oh my god, that would have been scary at home.

1264
01:37:52,470 --> 01:37:54,250
Am I DLSS on again?

1265
01:37:55,490 --> 01:37:55,970
No?

1266
01:37:56,470 --> 01:37:59,470
I've met many Supremes before, Strange.

1267
01:38:00,470 --> 01:38:02,270
What makes you so special?

1268

Oh, it is.

01:38:05,550 --> 01:38:06,470
Wait, it is on.

01:38:07,210 --> 01:38:08,650
Why is it on again?

01:38:08,950 --> 01:38:09,150

01:39:48,010 --> 01:39:49,750
Oh my god, he's not Captain America!

1292
01:39:50,010 --> 01:39:51,470
There is a god!

1293
01:39:53,230 --> 01:39:54,710
I'm Captain America.

1294
01:39:55,050 --> 01:39:56,670
I'm fucking free now.

1295
01:40:01,990 --> 01:40:03,730
I wish I could play a 200.

1296
01:40:03,910 --> 01:40:06,730
I think I could try if I had a 244 frames.

1297
01:40:13,790 --> 01:40:16,980
I'm actually...

1298
01:40:16,980 --> 01:40:18,220
Oh my god, I hope he does.

1299
01:40:25,660 --> 01:40:27,580
Oh my gosh, I wanted to see.

1300
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:28,700
Save our strange.

1301
01:40:29,100 --> 01:40:29,680
That sucked.

1302
01:40:29,840 --> 01:40:30,600
I'll shine.

1303
01:40:31,500 --> 01:40:31,700
Oh!

1304
01:40:32,340 --> 01:40:34,240
This might be where I die.

1305
01:40:34,640 --> 01:40:36,220
Good luck, everyone.

1306
01:40:36,720 --> 01:40:38,600
Good luck.

1307
01:40:43,500 --> 01:40:44,800
Oh no, he's back.

1308
01:40:45,140 --> 01:40:46,140
Oh no, he's back.

1309
01:40:46,400 --> 01:40:47,320
I spoke too soon.

1310
01:40:47,780 --> 01:40:50,280
He- he's back.

1311
01:40:50,720 --> 01:40:51,440
He's back.

1312
01:40:54,820 --> 01:40:57,580
I knew it was too good to be true.

1313
01:40:57,600 --> 01:40:58,020
true.

1314
01:40:58,440 --> 01:41:00,320
I fucking knew it was too good.

1315
01:41:00,680 --> 01:41:01,180
Oh, unlucky.

1316
01:41:01,820 --> 01:41:03,580
It was too good to be true, guys.

1317
01:41:04,400 --> 01:41:05,880
I wasn't meant to be happy.

1318
01:41:08,060 --> 01:41:09,680
I hear him.

1319
01:41:12,060 --> 01:41:17,980
Like, he didn't, if he pocketed me, like, sooner, I didn't have to use it.

1320
01:41:20,560 --> 01:41:21,900
Oh, okay, sure.

1321
01:41:23,140 --> 01:41:23,140
Sure.

1322
01:41:25,740 --> 01:41:26,060
Sure.

1323
01:41:27,040 --> 01:41:27,580
Sure.

1324
01:41:27,600 --> 01:41:33,420
I want to get rid of the clone just for now.

1325
01:41:34,440 --> 01:41:35,720
Come on, we just got...

1326
01:41:35,720 --> 01:41:37,040
Come on, we pocket each other.

1327
01:41:38,400 --> 01:41:38,500
Oh.

1328
01:41:39,560 --> 01:41:42,060
And we pocket each other, everything will be fine.

1329
01:41:44,880 --> 01:41:45,180
Nice.

1330
01:41:46,740 --> 01:41:48,020
Oh my god, nice.

1331
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:52,400
It's just that easy.

1332
01:41:55,380 --> 01:41:56,700
Oh, thank god we have our own.

1333
01:41:56,920 --> 01:41:57,360
What the?

1334
01:42:00,220 --> 01:42:05,120
oh thank god oh thank god they said nine again

1335
01:42:09,140 --> 01:42:25,280
what a comeback what a comeback bro this guy was literally carrying this entire team on his back like their captain america was carrying the entire team

1336
01:42:28,980 --> 01:42:32,980
holy shit i'm surprised we even been held that much.

1337
01:42:33,760 --> 01:42:36,080
I'm so surprised we're able to hold for that long.

1338
01:42:39,660 --> 01:42:42,060
Like, I think his back was broken at that point.

1339
01:42:42,860 --> 01:42:46,700
Like, I think I think he literally broke his back from that.

1340
01:42:53,300 --> 01:42:54,120
Wait, change it to 1080?

1341
01:42:54,320 --> 01:42:55,360
Is it actually not in 1080?

1342
01:42:55,980 --> 01:42:57,760
I thought I changed the bit rate.

1343
01:42:58,260 --> 01:42:58,780
