1
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,980
Can anyone play the guy with walls?

2
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:51,300
Wait what?

3
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:52,720
We can't, we can't, we can't.

4
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,860
Okay, none of us know this?

5
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,900
I think he's a Caesar character.

6
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,200
We are so fucked.

7
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:02,200
I wanted to play the Raichi guy.

8
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,420
His gun's based.

9
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,360
Oh yeah, that's the wall guy.

10
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:07,700
Hey guys, hey everybody.

11
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,400
I'm live right now by the way.

12
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,460
I'm live right now.

13
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,300
I go be...

14
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,560
I go be...

15
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:17,940
Guys, listen to me.

16
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:18,960
This is the strat.

17
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,900
First round you buy one thing.

18
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:26,820
And then next round if you don't have enough money for armor, sell whatever you bought and buy armor.

19
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,480
Okay, because I bought damage.

20
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,340
It's like on the right side.

21
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:32,240
It's just armor.

22
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:33,820
Press B, press B, sure.

23
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,100
Yeah, press B.

24
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,280
I bought damage.

25
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,560
Why do I go A or B?

26
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,920
I bought damage too.

27
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:39,220
I'm B.

28
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,520
I put turrets on B.

29
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,100
It's not A.

30
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,300
Someone needs to do mid.

31
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,500
Nobody's looking at mid.

32
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:47,200
We don't need mid.

33
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:47,740
We don't need mid.

34
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,480
We need A or B.

35
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:49,560
What if they fucking rush mid?

36
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:50,840
We're getting walled.

37
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,880
They put a wall on A.

38
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:52,300
They're going A.

39
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,240
Okay, okay.

40
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:53,860
These guys have strats.

41
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,580
Okay, yeah, that's what I'm...

42
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:55,920
Oh, me already.

43
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:56,360
What?

44
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,280
Dude, I got fucking run down.

45
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:57,740
Yeah, I double...

46
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:58,000
Oh.

47
00:02:59,660 --> 00:02:59,940
Okay.

48
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,180
He's looking at me with an auto sniper.

49
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,280
This is a mess already.

50
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:04,720
We don't...

51
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:04,940
They're all point.

52
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:06,640
I got one.

53
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:06,980
I got one.

54
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:07,340
One guy's low.

55
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:07,800
One guy's low.

56
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:08,920
Okay.

57
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,360
They planted the bomb.

58
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:10,880
I got one.

59
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,300
I got one on the ground.

60
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:13,800
Oh my god.

61
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,260
They're behind me.

62
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:14,540
Behind me.

63
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:14,780
Right here.

64
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:14,980
Right here.

65
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,720
It's a 2v2 situation.

66
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,040
It's a 2v2 situation.

67
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:19,520
Yeah, but we...

68
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,840
I am okay right now.

69
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:21,480
1v2.

70
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,080
1v2.

71
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:22,480
Last guy.

72
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:22,820
Last guy.

73
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:23,640
Last guy.

74
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:24,720
1v2.

75
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:25,620
Last guy.

76
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,400
He fused.

77
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,080
He fused.

78
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,520
I'm not...

79
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,080
I'm not res...

80
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:29,680
Okay.

81
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:30,620
Fuck you guys.

82
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:37,300
Yeah, you fucking crawl on the floor there.

83
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:38,040
All right.

84
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:40,800
For those who don't know, for in my chat, we just started tournament.

85
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:41,660
It was...

86
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:42,380
There was no breaks.

87
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,640
We just went straight in.

88
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,720
Let's go next.

89
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:44,980
Whoa.

90
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,060
Oh my god.

91
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,240
Who's that guy with free kills?

92
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,300
I don't know, man.

93
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:48,940
Who is that?

94
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:49,520
Wow.

95
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,780
Is that the top 20 Overwatch player?

96
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:52,840
Wait.

97
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:53,580
How do you know about that?

98
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,140
What the fuck?

99
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:57,460
Because I was like, who the fuck is this guy that's on our team?

100
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,520
I feel like he's top 20.

101
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:58,560
Can I go next?

102
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,460
Can I actually support him?

103
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,460
I can shield and shit.

104
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:00,700
I'm out.

105
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:01,520
Okay.

106
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:04,060
I don't know what's my character, Daz.

107
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,940
I don't even know what your character...

108
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:07,980
What are you playing?

109
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:09,920
Press F1.

110
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Press F1 and leave.

111
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:11,640
Press F1 and leave.

112
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,600
Read between rounds.

113
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:14,920
I don't know what's my character, Daz.

114
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:16,800
This is going great.

115
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,040
We're doing great, guys.

116
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:18,760
We're doing great.

117
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:20,260
I need to fix my game.

118
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:21,860
There's no breaks.

119
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:22,400
Oh yeah.

120
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:22,680
They're here.

121
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:22,980
They're here.

122
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,740
They're testing us.

123
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,300
They're going B now because A didn't work.

124
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:27,480
Yeah.

125
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,900
They know the best player is at A.

126
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:29,200
Ooh.

127
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,120
Yeah.

128
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:31,560
I was on A.

129
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,500
I'm not peeking.

130
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:32,840
No.

131
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,280
I'm talking about the actual best player.

132
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:35,100
Whoa.

133
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:35,860
Okay.

134
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,020
Oh my god.

135
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:37,420
I'm dying.

136
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:37,740
I'm dying.

137
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:38,440
IPN's dead.

138
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,020
We got to help him.

139
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,540
I'm going to rez IPN.

140
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:40,960
I'm looking.

141
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:41,640
I'm looking.

142
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:41,880
I'm looking here.

143
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,420
Help me.

144
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:42,560
Help me.

145
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:42,720
Help me.

146
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:44,360
I put them on the ground.

147
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:44,940
Thank you.

148
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:45,900
And we didn't thirst him though.

149
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,380
I was reloading.

150
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:48,840
I was reloading.

151
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,640
I can bullhack him too.

152
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,800
I'm looking at the side here.

153
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,200
I'm not in a good position.

154
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:52,720
I think they're rotating right now.

155
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,180
Yeah.

156
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:53,520
They did.

157
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:53,820
They rotated.

158
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:54,180
Yeah.

159
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:54,380
Okay.

160
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:55,160
Oh no.

161
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,040
There's one more.

162
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:56,480
One more.

163
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:57,460
No.

164
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:57,980
They're just staying.

165
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:58,360
They're staying.

166
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,020
They're staying?

167
00:04:59,160 --> 00:04:59,380
Okay.

168
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,780
I'm just going to put turrets back then.

169
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,620
I want to play solo A.

170
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:03,920
Yeah.

171
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,640
They might be rotating.

172
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,040
Wait.

173
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:12,920
They're going B.

174
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:13,460
They're back in B.

175
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:14,600
Wait?

176
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,080
What?

177
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:16,840
Oh.

178
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,100
They baited.

179
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,300
You want to play retake?

180
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,640
You got this, right?

181
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:20,880
Yeah.

182
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,320
You can play retake.

183
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:21,780
Yeah.

184
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,960
We got one down.

185
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:24,280
We got one down.

186
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,000
Nothing left.

187
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,840
Nothing left.

188
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:25,860
Yeah.

189
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:26,480
We're coming back.

190
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:26,860
We're coming back.

191
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:27,620
One stop left.

192
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,220
One stop left ramp.

193
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:29,860
Sorry.

194
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:30,140
Left.

195
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:30,480
Ready?

196
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:31,360
Yeah.

197
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:34,340
I'm heading over.

198
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:35,560
I might die doing this.

199
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,000
Oh, there's three guys here!

200
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:38,520
There's three guys here!

201
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,000
Four guys here!

202
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,660
I'm here, I'm here, I'm here.

203
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:42,620
Oh my god, what happened?

204
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:44,840
That shit blinds me when I go through it, man!

205
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:45,920
I got one!

206
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:46,320
I got one!

207
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:47,960
Ming's low, Ming's low.

208
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:49,100
Next behind you.

209
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:50,180
Yeah!

210
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,240
Nice!

211
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:52,720
One more, one more, one more, one more.

212
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:53,840
No, no, it's all dead.

213
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,180
Wait, yeah, we natural know.

214
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:56,420
Oh, wait, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm...

215
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:58,800
No!

216
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:58,800
No!

217
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,400
I carry!

218
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:00,960
Okay, okay, okay.

219
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:04,960
You have to use your peeker's advantage, bro.

220
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:05,400
Yeah!

221
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:06,540
Okay, I'm good.

222
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,540
I'm good.

223
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,180
That's on me.

224
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,540
Okay, I still don't have armor.

225
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:10,080
I went in first!

226
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:12,200
Why am I getting fucked up when I went in first?

227
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,220
I was talking about next.

228
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:15,680
Oh, okay.

229
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,280
Okay, so now buy the thing that tells you to buy.

230
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,640
I'm buying, I refunded some shit.

231
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,280
I refunded something for it.

232
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,160
Don't buy heavy shield.

233
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,040
Buy the light regen shield.

234
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,240
Wait, don't buy heavy shield?

235
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:26,640
Why not?

236
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:27,660
But it's heavy.

237
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,320
Because it doesn't regen.

238
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:28,960
Oh.

239
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,040
Yeah, but I'm gonna die anyway.

240
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,760
I'm not gonna live long enough to regen.

241
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,500
Guys, I'm gonna hold mid.

242
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,340
You see the back out?

243
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,180
I can like, Q you.

244
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,320
Like, just kill the snipers.

245
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,400
I can also flash.

246
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:44,100
They're mid.

247
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:44,880
They're mid.

248
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:45,540
I'm gonna come point mid.

249
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:46,880
Yeah, I see them.

250
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,560
They're KO-knifing me.

251
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:50,480
KO-knifing on me.

252
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:51,360
I've been spotted.

253
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,020
I'm smoking.

254
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:53,500
Ow.

255
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:54,740
They got mid.

256
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,480
They're close mid.

257
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:55,660
They smoked.

258
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:55,660
They smoked.

259
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:56,140
Mid to A.

260
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,000
Mid to A again.

261
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,100
Oh, they're here.

262
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:58,280
Okay.

263
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:58,980
I'm going back.

264
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:00,660
Mid to A again.

265
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:01,580
I'm coming to you guys.

266
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,320
Next night, I'm coming to you.

267
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,740
I'm gonna anchor, just in case they come back.

268
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:06,380
I downed one.

269
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:06,860
Oh, yeah.

270
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,240
Nice.

271
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:07,360
Nice.

272
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:07,920
Good job.

273
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,360
Good job.

274
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:08,940
I'm gonna flank.

275
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:09,420
I'm gonna flank.

276
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,120
They're rezzing him, though.

277
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:13,420
Okay.

278
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:14,300
Throw a nade.

279
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,060
Guy invisible on point.

280
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:18,040
I kind of fucked him up.

281
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,820
I'm gonna do something dumb.

282
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,260
You guys wanna push?

283
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:20,940
You guys wanna push?

284
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:21,820
I can flash it.

285
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,320
Flashing?

286
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:22,940
Yeah.

287
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,200
Fuck.

288
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:24,360
Wait.

289
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:24,620
I got one.

290
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:25,920
I got one.

291
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:26,500
I got one.

292
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:26,840
I got one.

293
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:26,980
I got one.

294
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:27,960
One on point.

295
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:28,300
One on point.

296
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:28,640
One on point.

297
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:29,680
One on point.

298
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:29,740
One on point.

299
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,020
In the corner.

300
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:30,420
Invisible.

301
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,780
Oh, I'm down.

302
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:34,240
Oh, I'm here.

303
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:34,780
Oh, I was here.

304
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,160
Oh, fuck.

305
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:37,580
I was trying to throw a set.

306
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:39,160
We went in one by one.

307
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:41,020
We need more on A, I think.

308
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:42,180
More on A.

309
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:42,320
More on A.

310
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,080
We had two on B.

311
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,260
I was on mid.

312
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,300
Oh, okay.

313
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:47,720
I'm rezzing back and forth.

314
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,260
But the thing is, if you get a knock, you gotta have nades.

315
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:51,080
Yeah, dude.

316
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,000
Have a nade.

317
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,320
I'm back.

318
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,080
Yeah, yeah.

319
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:56,420
Just nade him.

320
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,940
That's true, I have nades.

321
00:07:58,700 --> 00:07:59,640
Oh my god.

322
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,480
Because I flashed all of them.

323
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:03,380
I've been called but no one's there.

324
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:04,240
I have my turret.

325
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:04,900
I have my ult.

326
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,540
I can use my ult for take back.

327
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:09,760
What does your ult do?

328
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,580
My ult... I throw a fucking turret.

329
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,320
Oh yeah, it's ult-y.

330
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:14,760
Yeah, yeah.

331
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,680
I can use my ult for take back here.

332
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:17,960
It's not B.

333
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,360
It's not B.

334
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,260
Oh, it's mid.

335
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:21,840
Yeah, I see them.

336
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,720
I'm gonna throw my turret right now!

337
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:24,660
I'm gonna do it!

338
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:25,860
I'm behind him.

339
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,000
I'm gonna do it!

340
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:28,640
Doki, run.

341
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:29,920
Doki, there's a whole team on you.

342
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:30,780
I know, I know.

343
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:31,560
That's why I threw my turret.

344
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,140
Because I was scared.

345
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,700
They're fucking killing my turret.

346
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:34,100
He's dead.

347
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,200
My turret died instantly.

348
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:37,660
They're pushing Doki.

349
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:38,440
Someone's pushing Doki.

350
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,140
He's low, he's low, he's low, he's low!

351
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:41,900
They're all low as fuck.

352
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,140
They're all so low!

353
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:45,400
Go, go, go.

354
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:45,840
Push, push, push.

355
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:46,540
They're all blind.

356
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:46,860
They're all blind.

357
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,160
I'm low, they're all low.

358
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,840
I threw my grenade there.

359
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,240
How long was this fucking ult last?

360
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:54,500
My ult is down.

361
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:55,920
I'm down, I'm down, I knocked one.

362
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,060
I got it.

363
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:58,880
There's a sniper behind.

364
00:08:59,100 --> 00:08:59,160
There's two more.

365
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,020
Nice.

366
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:01,800
One more on the right side.

367
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,220
I'm pushing now.

368
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:02,880
I'm giving a fuck.

369
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:03,680
Yeah, yeah.

370
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:04,120
Go crazy.

371
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,240
Oh shit, go crazy!

372
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:05,260
I'm blind.

373
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,020
I can't see anything.

374
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:08,940
I'm ulting you.

375
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,360
I'm going crazy by crazy.

376
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,200
I mean, I'm not hitting anything.

377
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:15,280
I think our 200 ping is actually doing stuff right now.

378
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,600
Oh my god, pinged it!

379
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,540
Okay, if you get a full send, just tell me how old you are.

380
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,300
It's like...

381
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,760
Yeah, I did say it.

382
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,540
I did say it.

383
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:25,740
Yeah, but I didn't...

384
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:26,240
Okay.

385
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,600
Okay guys, calm down.

386
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:28,260
Everyone calm down.

387
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:33,260
By the way, just so you guys know, defense is harder than attack.

388
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:35,880
Defense is harder?

389
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:36,680
Because in attack you can just 5v1.

390
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,700
Yeah, in attack you can just storm.

391
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:39,360
Wait, on this map?

392
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:40,160
I don't know.

393
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,240
I don't remember this.

394
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,300
Guys, I have my... I'm awake.

395
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,240
I'm a professional.

396
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:45,280
I'm professional.

397
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,140
I'm awake right now.

398
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,120
Okay, I'm gonna...

399
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:48,980
I'm predicting a B push.

400
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,860
Yeah, but you don't even... Sherwood, do you know what your ult does?

401
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:52,720
It's...

402
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,620
He doesn't need to know.

403
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:53,980
He shoots him.

404
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,020
I'm KJ ult.

405
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:55,800
I'm KJ ult.

406
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:56,740
Okay.

407
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:58,940
He's KJ ult.

408
00:09:58,940 --> 00:09:59,480
It's not B.

409
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,140
It's not B.

410
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,240
It's not mid either.

411
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:01,700
It's an A push.

412
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,040
I see.

413
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:02,820
I'm rotating.

414
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:03,440
Okay, fine.

415
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:07,240
I have my grenade pre-caught.

416
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,260
They're mid, mid, mid, mid, mid, mid.

417
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:08,640
Oh, they're mid?

418
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:08,920
Okay.

419
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:09,920
Ooh, mid, mid, mid.

420
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,060
Ooh, next.

421
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,020
Don't die, next.

422
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,480
No, I'm fine.

423
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:12,760
I'm fine.

424
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:13,980
I went out A though.

425
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,640
Yeah, they're also nading me from mid.

426
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,360
They crossed from mid.

427
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,240
They crossed from mid to A.

428
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:18,580
Mid to A.

429
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,100
Yeah, mid to A.

430
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:19,420
Mid to A.

431
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:20,820
Okay, I'm going back to you then.

432
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,660
I'm fucking... They're wall hacking me.

433
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:23,340
Cheating, cheating.

434
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,700
Oh my God, it's as if this...

435
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:27,340
They're smoking the point, man.

436
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:29,880
I'm walling.

437
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:30,140
Got you.

438
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:30,840
I got one.

439
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,780
I'm ulting A.

440
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,320
Oh, he's coming.

441
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,140
One more, one more, one more.

442
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:34,600
One more site, one more site.

443
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:35,220
Hello, site.

444
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:35,520
Three, four, three, four.

445
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,120
We got two.

446
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:36,540
We got two.

447
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,180
Look at the wall hack.

448
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,020
Yeah, we're going, we're going.

449
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,260
I'm flashing up.

450
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:42,580
We got another.

451
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,600
I knocked him.

452
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:44,200
I fixed him.

453
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:44,520
I fixed him.

454
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,120
Last guy, last guy, last guy!

455
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,200
I'm waiting.

456
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:48,920
There you go.

457
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:49,120
Dead.

458
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,620
I used KJ ult.

459
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:50,860
Yeah!

460
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,200
I used me KJ ult.

461
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,840
Nice KJ.

462
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:20,120
I have another turret for take back again.

463
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,960
It says I can teleport between my things.

464
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:24,640
How do I do that?

465
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,860
I don't know.

466
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:26,480
I never played that.

467
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,840
I'm not KJ, I'm your chamber.

468
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,320
None of us play those.

469
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,780
No, I'm chamber and killjoy.

470
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:33,440
It's not me again.

471
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,420
It says my awakening lets me teleport.

472
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,020
They're going mid.

473
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,040
They're wall hacking me.

474
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:39,840
I'm slowed.

475
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,440
Throwing grenade out.

476
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,420
I'm gonna throw my turret out.

477
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:44,860
I'm gonna do it.

478
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,020
Nade out.

479
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:47,900
Wait, actually no.

480
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,260
Never mind.

481
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:48,960
I'm not gonna do it.

482
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,840
I realized they rotated.

483
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:52,960
They're on A.

484
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,420
Smoke's on A.

485
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:55,900
Terrible smoke on A.

486
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:57,440
I'm looking at...

487
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,120
One's on A right now.

488
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:00,420
Inside.

489
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:03,400
I'm throwing my turret.

490
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:04,940
I'm gonna do it.

491
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:06,080
I'm gonna do something fucking crazy.

492
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,380
Go cat, go!

493
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,240
All three push up.

494
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,040
What the fuck?

495
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,340
They're one.

496
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:12,560
No!

497
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,120
There's a sniper right here.

498
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:14,600
Half HP.

499
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,420
I didn't see him.

500
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:19,940
Oh, I fucked up.

501
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:20,680
I lost the ramp.

502
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,320
Oh my god, I even used my turret cat.

503
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,160
Oh my god, Nex, you got this.

504
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,380
I have a semi-auto weapon.

505
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,280
So I can't hold ramp if they three man me.

506
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,900
You want me to hold it?

507
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,300
No, they're not.

508
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,560
Okay, I'll play closer to you, Surfer.

509
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,800
I need to turn Surfer down, apparently.

510
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:43,180
Burn me down?

511
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:44,660
Yeah, you're too loud.

512
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,820
What if me and Nex is flanked?

513
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,280
I'm full support.

514
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:51,760
I always flank.

515
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,860
I just check if it's B, and if it's not, I flank on A.

516
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:58,560
I think I should sell this, and then go for...

517
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,980
What is this?

518
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,740
I think if you thirst...

519
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,040
Q.

520
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:08,260
When you thirst, do you get ult charge?

521
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:09,920
Like thirst somebody's kill?

522
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,700
Because I got my turret so fast.

523
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,280
Probably.

524
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,920
So I guess it's just good to thirst, in general.

525
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,460
Do you still want me to smoke this?

526
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,520
I thirst as soon as I can.

527
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:23,460
Yeah, I thirst too, but I got my turret so fast there.

528
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,240
No one B again.

529
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:25,580
Mid again.

530
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,400
They're just doing A all the time.

531
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:27,880
Mid, mid.

532
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,100
I saw someone in mid.

533
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:30,780
Too mid.

534
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,920
It's always A.

535
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,560
Yeah, it's just always A.

536
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,660
I think they just know it works.

537
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,640
I'll play closer to you, Surfer.

538
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,320
Yeah, yeah.

539
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,980
I got spotted, so they know I'm here.

540
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:46,920
Smoking him.

541
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,080
Wait, someone's close.

542
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,340
Oh yeah, one right here.

543
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:52,140
On point, on point, on A point.

544
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:54,960
Oh, I see, I see somebody on me.

545
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,080
Smoke.

546
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:57,160
Right here, right here.

547
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:59,380
The sniper's low.

548
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,780
One down, one down.

549
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:02,920
Fire my gun.

550
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,160
I'm blind.

551
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:06,820
What the hell is happening?

552
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:07,380
I'm dying too.

553
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,600
It's fine, I can rest my soul.

554
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,060
They're pushing the ramp.

555
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,000
Yeah, they fucking killed me from the ramp.

556
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:16,560
I'm pushing top right.

557
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:19,180
I'm maybe resable up here.

558
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:19,700
I'm ramping.

559
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:22,600
One high.

560
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,680
One more on high.

561
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,960
He's right above you, I'm pushing with you.

562
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:30,020
I'm not there, I can't climb this wall.

563
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,240
I thought I could paper the wall.

564
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:38,280
My SMG looking ass cannot handle this shit on the fucking ramp, bro.

565
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:40,780
Alright, here we go.

566
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:43,660
What does damage-rad ratio mean?

567
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:44,620
I don't know.

568
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:45,880
I'm gonna put that because it looked cool.

569
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,900
I bought it because it looked cool.

570
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:52,340
It's a string shield damage-rad plus 25%.

571
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:53,920
I have no idea.

572
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,540
That's your stream.

573
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,380
Oh, damage-rad!

574
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,540
Okay, yeah, I bought that shit.

575
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:02,980
That's good shit.

576
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:03,800
I didn't say red.

577
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,560
If they all come here, let's make a play, okay?

578
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,680
You back out and I'll flash it and I'll ult you.

579
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,020
This is such a close game.

580
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,920
It's not B, they're going...

581
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:14,520
Oh yeah, nevermind.

582
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:14,960
It is B.

583
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:15,860
There's a lot B here.

584
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,840
Okay, I have my turrets back there.

585
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,180
I need help.

586
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:19,920
I see mid.

587
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:20,660
I'm flashing.

588
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,540
Mid's coming in too.

589
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,240
They smoked mid.

590
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,580
They smoked mid and I'm a little paper boy.

591
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:32,700
We're stacking this shit.

592
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:33,140
They're here.

593
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,100
Behind you guys.

594
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:36,540
I have HP.

595
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,100
They're all here.

596
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:40,780
My turrets.

597
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:41,320
My turrets.

598
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:44,340
Where we died?

599
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:44,680
Where we died?

600
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:45,140
Where we died?

601
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,500
Oh, this is going to be awkward.

602
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,760
They figured out my spread, guys.

603
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:50,860
I ulted.

604
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,720
I'm healing myself.

605
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:54,660
I'm doing shit.

606
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,600
I'm doing shit to them.

607
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,220
I'm coming over.

608
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:01,780
I saw a name.

609
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,360
I'm blind as a bat.

610
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,700
Where are they?

611
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,700
I think they're resing right here.

612
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,400
Wait, they got me revealed.

613
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:12,060
Oh my god, he's one shot.

614
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:13,240
Oh no.

615
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:13,320
No.

616
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,120
No.

617
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,880
There's three and there's no way.

618
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:22,620
Guys, I think the way to play this game is like...

619
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:22,980
Oh, we switched.

620
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:23,520
Never mind.

621
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:27,260
I don't even know how to play this girl.

622
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:30,060
In attack.

623
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,760
I think I'll play the flying woman.

624
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,280
How did they come behind us next?

625
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:41,480
I don't know how that happened to you.

626
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,560
Yes, I was so fast.

627
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:44,940
They probably used the paper.

628
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:45,960
Oh, that's true.

629
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:46,920
They used the paper for him.

630
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,460
Pick a smoke grenade.

631
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:51,280
I'm gonna get a deagle too.

632
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:52,080
What's the smoke grenade?

633
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,320
I didn't get it.

634
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:56,160
I have frag grenades and heal grenade.

635
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:58,740
What's the point of...

636
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:01,480
Why plant the bomb when you can just kill them?

637
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,180
Yeah, but how do you know we're gonna kill them?

638
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:04,900
How do you...

639
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:05,980
That's the thing.

640
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:08,440
If you plant the bomb, we're sitting ducks, you know?

641
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,420
We just kill them.

642
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:13,160
We just leave the bomb in spawn.

643
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,220
Let's just leave it.

644
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,040
Who wants the bomb?

645
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,660
I shouldn't be the bomb carrier.

646
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:19,400
I can.

647
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,500
I'll play full support.

648
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:22,520
Let's go B.

649
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,480
Let's do a wall.

650
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:25,700
Anywhere.

651
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:28,560
I have my slow thing.

652
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:29,060
I should use my wall.

653
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,740
You have abilities, Sherpa.

654
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,160
Diagonal.

655
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,060
Preferable.

656
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,900
I got spotted.

657
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,980
We got spotted, by the way.

658
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:41,720
They scanned us.

659
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:43,460
One's close.

660
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:46,600
I hit them.

661
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:47,240
I slowed them.

662
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:51,060
Is that our wall or theirs?

663
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:52,080
It's ours.

664
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,560
They're in that corner thing.

665
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,120
I got hit by it.

666
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:58,200
Do you want to...

667
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,140
We killed them.

668
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,660
What the fuck?

669
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:03,480
They're in the window there.

670
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,920
I'm beaming them in the window.

671
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:05,800
Oh, shit.

672
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:09,080
I got fragged.

673
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,100
They're on the ramp here.

674
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:11,180
I'm my ping.

675
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:13,800
I beamed them in the ramp.

676
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,040
One down.

677
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:16,900
Above us.

678
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,740
I'm throwing nades.

679
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:21,620
I'm dead to a nade.

680
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:22,400
Two here.

681
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:24,700
He's one.

682
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:25,640
No.

683
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:28,560
That guy was one.

684
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,300
I got one guy.

685
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:31,680
That was one.

686
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:33,900
He's pushing.

687
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:35,660
Nice.

688
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,060
I got an alpha.

689
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,260
He's on me up top.

690
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:42,140
I'm dead.

691
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:43,800
It's a 1v1.

692
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:44,820
We got the bomb though.

693
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,740
You can stall it.

694
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:48,420
I'm dead.

695
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,800
You got this.

696
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:53,740
My gun is not built for close quarters.

697
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:57,620
Guys, I don't...

698
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:04,620
I did not expect my two players to just sit there and get shot in the face when I said they're up top.

699
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,780
You said he's up top and I died in the same second you said he was up top.

700
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,080
I had no chance to react.

701
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,880
To be fair, you guys should not have been rezzing when there was just one person left.

702
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,500
He just rezzed me.

703
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,240
No, it was two.

704
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,520
Now you need to sell and buy armor.

705
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,040
I have to sell?

706
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:21,520
Yeah.

707
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:23,520
Now, you're reaching.

708
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,740
We did the same thing, but we do it faster.

709
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:27,900
Don't get stuck behind.

710
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,500
Let's run all the way up here.

711
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,220
Let's get control of this upper part.

712
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,600
They're going to scout us out.

713
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,600
Can we play a little further back?

714
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,820
We found a way to use the scan.

715
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:38,600
Don't just stun.

716
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,880
I'm just going to be paper.

717
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,120
I'm on the wall.

718
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:45,420
Me too.

719
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,660
Paper Mario.

720
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:48,600
How long do you want to use stun?

721
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,160
It takes like six seconds.

722
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:52,800
I've been spotted.

723
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:57,780
Maybe you shouldn't have been there during the paper Mario.

724
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,160
I don't know how long that should have fucking stuck.

725
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:00,980
Let's go.

726
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,840
You can move with the Bloodhound Scan.

727
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,200
I'm going A.

728
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,260
No, he's faking.

729
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,680
Let him fake.

730
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:11,720
Oh shit.

731
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:12,960
Me and Nex are also faking.

732
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,560
I fucked up guys.

733
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:16,980
Okay, sure.

734
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:17,880
For me, don't fake.

735
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:20,100
Maybe don't fake.

736
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,980
I was trying to build my wall and got flanked.

737
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:22,900
I slowed him.

738
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,740
I'm fucked here guys.

739
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,080
I'm planting the bomb.

740
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,300
I threw a nade there behind.

741
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,920
I hit somebody with my nade.

742
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,280
No one's covering you?

743
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,720
No one is.

744
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,560
I'm trying but I thought he said attack was easier.

745
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,180
I'm trying but I thought he said attack was easier.

746
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:41,140
Behind us.

747
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:43,440
What the fuck happened?

748
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,960
What the fuck happened?

749
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,320
How many rounds is this to?

750
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:49,820
Let's try A this time.

751
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:53,180
We have time to re-establish.

752
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:53,920
We have time.

753
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:55,440
We can re-establish.

754
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,980
Let's go A.

755
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,380
Let's do something together.

756
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:00,960
You mean together?

757
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:03,420
If we do something together, then we can win.

758
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:03,960
Okay.

759
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,560
That sounds good.

760
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,140
That was my ult dude.

761
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,720
Oh my god dude.

762
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,600
It's the super uber.

763
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:13,940
It's the metro wall.

764
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:16,140
I only played this shit in the deathmatch mode.

765
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:17,340
Oh my god.

766
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,260
Listen, if you use your wall and then you use your ult, I think you get wallhack through your wall.

767
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,960
And it blocks bullets it said.

768
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,040
Nice.

769
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:29,240
Cool.

770
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:30,820
Yeah.

771
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:31,820
Your ult blocks bullets.

772
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:33,040
Only your ult does.

773
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,700
Your ping with Z by the way.

774
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:38,240
They got fucking lasers.

775
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,020
They got lasers.

776
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:41,920
Chill, chill.

777
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:42,560
We're gonna go flank.

778
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:43,100
Okay.

779
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,040
We're not really looking at our flanks right now.

780
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:46,500
Not gonna lie.

781
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,000
I'm looking at our flank.

782
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,140
I'm gonna look at our flank.

783
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:54,520
Let's turn around.

784
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,360
Let's fucking just go through mid to B.

785
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,060
No, no, no.

786
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,880
Sit right here and then go A again.

787
00:21:59,240 --> 00:21:59,940
Cause I have my wall.

788
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:02,020
You've been spotted.

789
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:03,960
It's fine.

790
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,480
There's a Queen on there.

791
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:06,340
A bear is scouting.

792
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:10,420
The bear knows where we're at now.

793
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,080
The bear is still scouting.

794
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:15,040
Nobody shot the bear.

795
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,960
I shot the bear.

796
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:17,140
It's not that easy.

797
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:17,880
Calm down.

798
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,400
He's so big.

799
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,340
What do you mean he's not?

800
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:20,740
Okay.

801
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:24,640
I'm gonna put this in here.

802
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:25,740
That's my slow.

803
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:26,800
Everyone chill.

804
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,060
We have 55 seconds.

805
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,320
I can build another wall A.

806
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,080
Wait, wait, wait.

807
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,520
The ice is insane.

808
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,980
I'm building another wall A.

809
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:35,780
I'm gonna cut all the people off in mid.

810
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:38,300
We're going A.

811
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,940
They know that we've been spotted.

812
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,080
We've been spotted.

813
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:41,820
We've been spotted for 24 hours.

814
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,900
Go, go, go.

815
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:45,520
Kill the guy on the ramp.

816
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:46,740
Oh my god.

817
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:47,740
You're fucking body blocking me.

818
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:49,440
I didn't think you would walk backwards.

819
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:53,060
Where's the ramp?

820
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,800
We're a fucking mess, guys.

821
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,120
I killed one.

822
00:22:58,860 --> 00:22:59,600
Oh my god.

823
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:00,040
I have to reload.

824
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,560
I said push A and no one pushed.

825
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:04,700
No one pushed.

826
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:06,100
And then I body blocked you.

827
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,760
That's two with me.

828
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:09,620
Wait.

829
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:10,580
Can I call?

830
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:12,620
Yes, please.

831
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,300
Okay.

832
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:13,780
Let me call.

833
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:17,080
Yeah, I don't trust RPR's captain anymore.

834
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:18,580
We're gonna go A, but don't...

835
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:19,960
Stay with me.

836
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,180
Go further back.

837
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:21,880
Don't get spotted.

838
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,880
The moment we execute, just go in as fast as you can.

839
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:26,440
It doesn't matter.

840
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,500
The longer we take, they're gonna...

841
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:32,000
I feel like we should just run in instant instead of waiting.

842
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:33,700
Yeah, that's what...

843
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,060
Fuck the skin.

844
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,660
Fuck you.

845
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:37,360
I'm not gonna call then.

846
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,540
If you're gonna call, I'm not calling.

847
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,260
All I'm saying is...

848
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:46,180
Every single time we've waited, they've all just scanned and then ran out.

849
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:48,200
Okay, now they know because they used the beer.

850
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:49,500
Just push.

851
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,940
There's fucking one guy.

852
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:51,800
I'm pushing.

853
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:52,260
I'm pushing.

854
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:53,220
Oh my god.

855
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:54,400
They grenaded.

856
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:54,600
Okay.

857
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:55,620
All right.

858
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,500
That's why you wait.

859
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,340
You guys didn't want to push.

860
00:23:59,480 --> 00:23:59,840
Just push.

861
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,020
I'm pushing.

862
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:01,420
I'm smoking the bomb.

863
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,320
Go put the bomb.

864
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,940
Oh, there's so much stuff going on.

865
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:05,860
I can't see anything.

866
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:06,200
I can't see anything.

867
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,380
There's so much stuff going on.

868
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:08,080
I'm fucking needing.

869
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:09,900
Smoking that off.

870
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,600
I can't see anything.

871
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,660
We're running through mid.

872
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:14,320
We're running through mid.

873
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:15,500
Run that guy.

874
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:15,960
Run him down.

875
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:16,360
Run him down.

876
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,000
There's one guy here.

877
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:17,960
He's one.

878
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:18,180
He's one.

879
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:18,940
I can't see.

880
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:19,940
There's three of them.

881
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,260
One more.

882
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:21,560
One more.

883
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:21,940
Help me.

884
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:22,600
Behind you.

885
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:22,780
Behind you.

886
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:23,040
Behind you.

887
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:23,380
Behind you.

888
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:26,560
There's two.

889
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:27,320
There's two behind.

890
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:27,860
There's two here.

891
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,240
There's two here.

892
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:29,220
Oh, they...

893
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:31,880
Guys, I think they're more coordinated.

894
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,020
I think...

895
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:37,220
Also, when we push, we don't have to all go through the same corridor.

896
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,360
Listen to me.

897
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,440
They have set-ups to scout us out.

898
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,260
They have scanners.

899
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,200
I think that's why you wait.

900
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:44,040
They're always going to scan us.

901
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:47,540
The guy on B has a long cooldown.

902
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,540
That's why I'm...

903
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:49,720
Dude, I'm not calling.

904
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:52,140
He gave up.

905
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:55,320
Bro, let's listen to IP and I feel like he knows what he's doing.

906
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,240
All right.

907
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,040
I'm waiting.

908
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,420
I thought you said defense was hardy.

909
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:01,180
You don't get to speak.

910
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,740
I thought you said defense was hardy.

911
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:05,160
I feel like attack was hardy.

912
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:08,280
I feel like attack was hardy.

913
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,620
Okay, what are we doing, IGEL?

914
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:13,320
I feel like this is not even the hardest thing.

915
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:13,620
Just play on B.

916
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:14,260
Stand here.

917
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:16,320
Stand where our PR is.

918
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,140
Stay here for at least four seconds.

919
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,460
We're staying here.

920
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,360
This is very close.

921
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,740
We can actually execute fast.

922
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:23,620
We're so far back.

923
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:24,500
Okay, don't worry.

924
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,260
I'm coming over then.

925
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,320
Oh shit, they pushed us.

926
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,760
We're so far back!

927
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,440
The waiting strat worked.

928
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,960
They're cheating at this point.

929
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,020
We can re-escalate on A.

930
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,540
Play as a ball.

931
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:41,200
They can't do anything when we push as a five man.

932
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:42,880
Am I carrying the ball?

933
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:43,200
Go A.

934
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:45,380
We're coming over.

935
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:47,060
Mid!

936
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:48,120
Mid!

937
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:48,280
Mid!

938
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:48,320
Mid!

939
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,700
Kill the bear.

940
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:53,540
Kill the bear.

941
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,400
I almost killed someone.

942
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:57,620
Maybe we can execute faster.

943
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:58,700
I have ulti.

944
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:00,700
I'm looking at our backs.

945
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:01,420
I'm checking flanks.

946
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:01,760
Mid to B?

947
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,660
Yeah, let's do that.

948
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:05,240
I'm wall hacking.

949
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,820
Push, push, push.

950
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,200
I can ulti if you...

951
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:12,300
Oh, I got two!

952
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:12,540
I got two!

953
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:12,960
I got two on me!

954
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:14,900
Okay, this is free.

955
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:15,360
This is free.

956
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:16,700
Bomb down.

957
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:17,240
Putting the bomb.

958
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,680
Yeah, I hit a lot of people there.

959
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:20,300
I post plant.

960
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:21,080
I post plant.

961
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,140
Oh, I got hit.

962
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:22,620
Knocked.

963
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:23,820
But we knocked one.

964
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:26,020
I'm killing you, Arpa.

965
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:27,480
Oh, there's two here to stop.

966
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:27,900
There's two right here.

967
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:28,780
There's one on the corner.

968
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:29,520
Yeah.

969
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,720
Is someone on me?

970
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,380
I killed the robot.

971
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:34,360
There's two on top.

972
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:35,400
There's two on top.

973
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:35,960
Three V2.

974
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:38,540
It's fine.

975
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:39,520
I'm gonna awaken.

976
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:41,180
Oh, no.

977
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,360
You are not awakening.

978
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:43,160
The heat on.

979
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,460
Jokes over your dead.

980
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,060
Guys, I think this team is...

981
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:49,580
Okay, but I feel like...

982
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:50,100
Better.

983
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:56,980
I feel like if we did this earlier, instead of fucking yapping 24-7, we would actually have a chance in attack.

984
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:57,860
I can't.

985
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,400
Oh, hey, I'm second top fragger.

986
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:03,340
That's... Hello?

987
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:03,720
I'm second!

988
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:07,540
I feel like we need to dock here and we continue.

989
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,660
Hey, guys, I feel like ping...

990
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:10,200
Oh, wait, no.

991
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:11,100
Next... Never mind.

992
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:11,600
Next is you.

993
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:12,740
Yeah.

994
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,460
Guys, I had 11 knocked.

995
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,680
Guys, I had 11 knocked.

996
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,880
Yeah, but you didn't finish them!

997
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,400
And the one...

998
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,440
I'm a DMR player.

999
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:26,740
I'm a DMR player.

1000
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,440
How can I just look at the chat?

1001
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:31,440
So, wait.

1002
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:32,020
Is this like...

1003
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:33,180
We play one map only?

1004
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:34,440
Yeah, only one match per team.

1005
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,020
Yeah, and then we play a different team.

1006
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,040
Yeah, we fucking suck.

1007
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:39,940
We need to reconsider our life choices right here.

1008
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:43,840
Guys, RPR, I thought you said you're gonna make a team that's gonna win this.

1009
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,480
Like, what was...

1010
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:48,140
You can't win if people don't use the map.

1011
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:48,240
You...

1012
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:51,800
You gaslit me into joining this team.

1013
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:56,140
We did listen and then the guy just ran it down mid and shot us.

1014
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,400
Listen...

1015
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:00,360
You're not...

1016
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,420
You're uncoachable.

1017
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,520
Like, I can't help you.

1018
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:04,180
I'm literally... That was second fragger!

1019
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,800
You can't say that!

1020
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:07,140
And what did that do for us?

1021
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,640
That what I do?

1022
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:11,100
We got like 4-9!

1023
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,500
Or 5-9.

1024
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,240
I don't even know.

1025
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,240
I think we need to put Surefire on sniper rifle.

1026
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,260
He was on sniper this entire time!

1027
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:22,080
I'm on DMR.

1028
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:22,540
No, it doesn't.

1029
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:24,380
If you hit headshot, boom, dead.

1030
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:27,620
Yeah, but if you miss, then you're useless for 5 minutes.

1031
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:28,460
Yeah, but if you miss, then you're useless for 5 minutes.

1032
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:29,020
That's so true.

1033
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:30,840
Don't miss!

1034
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,400
Don't miss, hello?

1035
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:34,980
Unbelievable.

1036
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,920
This guy's a level 30, bro.

1037
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:37,540
Not fair.

1038
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:41,040
Bro, you could've grinded this game whenever!

1039
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,540
I'm the highest level in here!

1040
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,720
What are you talking about?

1041
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:47,240
I'm level 5.

1042
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,460
He's level 5!

1043
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,240
Why aren't you level 30?

1044
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,680
Why didn't you grind this game, RPR?

1045
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,740
Why aren't you level 30?

1046
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:56,940
Because I'm not captain.

1047
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,330
I'm not captain and I have a life outside of...

1048
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:02,580
No, you don't.

1049
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:03,220
No, you don't.

1050
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:03,820
Yes, I do.

1051
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:05,620
No, you don't.

1052
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:06,540
Yes, I do.

1053
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,180
I can stream other things.

1054
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:11,720
Okay, how do we literally destroy it?

1055
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:13,840
I don't...

1056
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,540
What do you mean?

1057
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,960
We don't have a room code yet.

1058
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,800
Yeah, we're not gonna go in for a while.

1059
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,140
We gotta go practice now.

1060
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,220
And make a custom room!

1061
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,520
Leave and make a custom.

1062
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:26,640
There's a 30 minute break!

1063
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:29,360
There's a 30 minute break?!

1064
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,760
We lost too fast, Donkey!

1065
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:32,540
We lost too fast!

1066
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:34,420
We do need that 30 minutes.

1067
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:39,440
The next game for you guys starts at 3 PM EST, alright?

1068
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:40,400
The next game for you guys starts at 3 PM EST, alright?

1069
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,860
We'll get you 30 minutes before then, alright?

1070
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:46,260
Wait, wait, how many games do we have?

1071
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:47,880
So...

1072
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,980
You guys are scheduled for...

1073
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:51,740
1, 2, 3 games.

1074
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
You will end off at 3 PM EST.

1075
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,960
Oh, okay, I was gonna be like...

1076
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,720
Holy shit, I have to leave at 3 PM EST.

1077
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:01,440
We're gonna try to see if we can end you off a little earlier.

1078
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:02,660
We're gonna try to see if we can end you off a little earlier.

1079
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:06,260
We'll end the chat off a little earlier, as it seems.

1080
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:07,000
We'll end the chat off a little earlier, as it seems.

1081
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,580
Okay, so what's the strat, RPR?

1082
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:12,180
Okay, can I ask you a question?

1083
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:12,480
Can I ask something?

1084
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:15,320
How many in here has played either CS or Valorant?

1085
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,160
At a high level.

1086
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,320
I got to Radiant.

1087
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:20,400
Huh?

1088
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,660
I'm a CS surf professional.

1089
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:24,840
I got to Radiant once.

1090
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:28,740
Okay, so it's the same concept of baiting out fucking utility, right?

1091
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:33,280
They're gonna use scan, the bear is like a fucking Sova drone, just kill it, and then...

1092
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:36,120
They're gonna re-rotate all the time.

1093
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,780
It's about playing the re-rotation all the time.

1094
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:42,620
You bait utility, you try to make them to rotate, and then you can just...

1095
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:46,940
By holding it together, if one of them peeks and you know if he caught, you can literally run him down.

1096
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:50,240
Or you can choose to just re-rotate another place.

1097
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,880
It's about map coverage.

1098
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,860
You play the information game, and then once you get it, you can execute.

1099
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:58,540
But they don't have...

1100
00:30:58,540 --> 00:30:58,980
Valorant sucks.

1101
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,280
Yeah, but they don't have unlimited utility.

1102
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:02,440
That's why you bait it out.

1103
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:04,280
We have like two minutes, three minutes or something.

1104
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:13,360
That's why you play hard, you use the scan, and then if we go, let's say, we used all the utilities on us, right?

1105
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:17,740
That's why we pressure mid or B, and then we can just execute A afterwards, because they used everything.

1106
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,100
But that doesn't matter.

1107
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,340
But that doesn't matter.

1108
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:28,020
If five people just cause five different things.

1109
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,700
Who's gonna IGL?

1110
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:31,360
You IGL.

1111
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:32,560
I'm not!

1112
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:35,220
You IGL.

1113
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:35,740
It's over.

1114
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:39,000
When you say people don't listen to you, it's literally just Surefour.

1115
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:47,900
Actually, if you look at the recording, when he said, okay, go A, I was the only one on top of him when you three were jerking off in a corner.

1116
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,280
I was getting shocked!

1117
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:57,600
Because even on ramp, I don't know if you remember, when three people just ran me and you down, we couldn't do anything.

1118
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,660
Because even if you trade, you're still knocked.

1119
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,980
I also had a semi-auto weapon.

1120
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,520
But you know what I mean, though.

1121
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,580
The only way for us to stop is to use utility.

1122
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:08,120
Or, nade.

1123
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:11,020
If you get a knock, toss a frag grenade on top of it.

1124
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,700
Can we put this into...

1125
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:14,980
Let's add AI.

1126
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:16,060
To here.

1127
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:17,320
What?

1128
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,960
Let's practice with AI.

1129
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:19,860
What?

1130
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:23,020
What?

1131
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:28,580
Yeah, we also don't have the right nades equipped, by the way.

1132
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:31,760
They use the wind nades, smoke nades, slow nades.

1133
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:32,260
I didn't know those exist.

1134
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:34,260
We need to use...

1135
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:36,560
I think frag grenade and heal nade are the best.

1136
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:42,400
I feel like every team in this tournament is a Valorant team, except for us.

1137
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:44,560
We are...

1138
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,560
Yeah, pretty much.

1139
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,140
Can we not make excuses?

1140
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:49,080
We are not equipped for this.

1141
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:52,000
I'm starting this custom game we're practicing.

1142
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:53,840
Some players are not ready.

1143
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,640
Maybe we should have done this before the tournament.

1144
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,760
Yeah, RPI.

1145
00:32:58,780 --> 00:32:59,260
Yeah.

1146
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:03,080
You're looking at me like it's my fault.

1147
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:03,760
You're the captain.

1148
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,560
Like, even if I said, maybe you guys are not ready.

1149
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:07,060
You guys want to practice?

1150
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:09,340
You'd be like, nah, I don't have the time to practice, guys.

1151
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:12,760
I played the game.

1152
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:18,140
We are also a better defender team, just because it requires less coordination on the defense.

1153
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,820
It's all about the frags.

1154
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:23,640
The thing is, we got to capitalize on damage.

1155
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,260
Like, if we get a knock or something, we have to do something.

1156
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:31,140
Even if I call flashes, if I flash someone, just fucking go in, please.

1157
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,260
It's like, if you go one by one, it's just over.

1158
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:34,720
I did that and I died, by the way.

1159
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,280
I'm sorry.

1160
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,620
Apparently, we need the painter girl.

1161
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:43,220
She's called Madalena.

1162
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:45,380
Painter?

1163
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,540
Which one is that?

1164
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:47,400
Painter.

1165
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,100
She paints.

1166
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,360
Which one was that?

1167
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,600
I don't know.

1168
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,460
What does she look like?

1169
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,720
Is it a glasses girl?

1170
00:33:58,980 --> 00:33:59,700
I'm Michelle.

1171
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,240
Madalena or some shit.

1172
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:05,020
What?

1173
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,120
What?

1174
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,960
I've equipped a wind grenade and a slow grenade.

1175
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,620
I feel like they fucked us with those.

1176
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,540
I forgot the change.

1177
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:17,200
I have a telltale grenade.

1178
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:18,920
What is a telltale grenade?

1179
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,460
Wind grenade is like, to slow down pushes.

1180
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:23,380
So it's really good for defense.

1181
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,620
I think it tells.

1182
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:26,460
Oh, is it like a scouter?

1183
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:28,780
Maybe.

1184
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,940
I guess we just practice YouTube.

1185
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,000
I guess we just practice YouTube.

1186
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:37,800
Okay, apparently the Madalena is a DMR that has a lot of damage.

1187
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:39,600
She has goo that slows everyone.

1188
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:40,720
And she's OP as fuck.

1189
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:41,880
That's what chat is telling me.

1190
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,640
Okay, so who is going to play her?

1191
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,100
Who is the player?

1192
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:47,940
I want to do sword girl more.

1193
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:48,920
Not me.

1194
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:49,760
It's not B.

1195
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,200
I can swap.

1196
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,340
I can play the goo girl.

1197
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,420
We just won't have his.

1198
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:02,140
I don't feel like snipers work in this game.

1199
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,420
I mean these are bots though.

1200
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:09,680
Yeah, it's like...

1201
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,960
We're fucking them up.

1202
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:13,640
Wow, look at these bots.

1203
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:14,560
Guys, they're executing.

1204
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:19,940
We gotta figure out who's playing who and who's throwing nades where.

1205
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,440
That's literally all we gotta figure out.

1206
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,780
I'm not sure how we're doing it against the bots.

1207
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,040
Among us.

1208
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:38,440
There's also an interceptor nade which apparently blocks all other nades.

1209
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:39,640
It's like...

1210
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,700
That's what we need for attacks.

1211
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:42,760
Basically.

1212
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:45,400
Interceptor nade.

1213
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:46,740
It's also good for defense too.

1214
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:49,720
Because they execute with flash and smokes.

1215
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:50,120
Oh.

1216
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,820
I put my spirit.

1217
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:57,120
Okay, I expect you guys to do all the grenade stuff.

1218
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,240
My brain is too small for that.

1219
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:02,000
My brain is too small for that.

1220
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,820
I don't know how to use my abilities.

1221
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:04,380
I don't know how to use my abilities.

1222
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:08,720
Frag grenade is only good if we get a knock to finish from distance.

1223
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:10,220
Frag grenade is only good if we get a knock to finish from distance.

1224
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:14,980
That's why I'll be the frag grenade to make sure we get our knocks.

1225
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:20,740
I feel like I set the difficulty of this AI to piss low or something.

1226
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,620
I'm pretty sure.

1227
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:23,320
I mean it's AI.

1228
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,460
AI is always not good.

1229
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,540
Don't say that.

1230
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:29,700
I played against AI in ranked and they were crazy.

1231
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:33,920
You don't even know which one is AI and which one isn't.

1232
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:35,420
Yeah you do.

1233
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:36,260
How do you know?

1234
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:38,240
What would the names be?

1235
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:43,080
It's like two words in the world like capitalized.

1236
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,040
Like celestial wind or some shit.

1237
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,500
I think...

1238
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,160
Wait, can I end this match?

1239
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,620
And we can make AI harder?

1240
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:56,580
Alright.

1241
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:57,620
Surrender.

1242
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:00,660
I can't believe that we're surrendering to AI.

1243
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:02,940
We're practicing.

1244
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:05,840
This is a good game.

1245
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:07,260
This is in the name of practice.

1246
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,340
Apparently these are level 1 AIs.

1247
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:13,220
Can we surrender?

1248
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:16,800
It said in the next round it will start.

1249
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:21,780
We just bone rush it and then just kill all of them.

1250
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:23,400
I'm just gonna bone rush.

1251
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:28,280
Oh yeah, the wallhack that next has is only for you next.

1252
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,260
Yeah, I know.

1253
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,820
That's why I always call it out if I see people or not.

1254
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,900
They're all made up here.

1255
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:34,980
We should do it.

1256
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:36,440
Alright, kill all of them so we can surrender.

1257
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:40,480
We should use next as our little scouter.

1258
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:41,260
Yeah, yeah.

1259
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:46,140
Dude, this wind nade is so fucking annoying.

1260
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,700
That's my wind nade, better.

1261
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,300
It's so annoying.

1262
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,040
Look, I just nade it.

1263
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:52,360
It's fine.

1264
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:55,380
Here's a slow nade too, guys.

1265
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,280
Thanks.

1266
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:56,800
Yay!

1267
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,060
Oh, the slow nade doesn't slow us.

1268
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:00,620
It's just them.

1269
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:02,540
Yeah, it should.

1270
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:02,920
Yeah.

1271
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,580
Makes sense.

1272
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:10,920
I think we literally just lost on fucking nades when you think about it.

1273
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:12,040
Yeah, 100%.

1274
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:14,400
I thought we were... oh, they're gonna surrender.

1275
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:14,780
Alright.

1276
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,740
Wait, how do you ping in this game?

1277
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:18,320
Z.

1278
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,540
Guys, why'd you surrender?

1279
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:21,160
We were winning.

1280
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:26,560
Team MVP!

1281
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:27,180
No!

1282
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,560
She's crying!

1283
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:33,460
Yo.

1284
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:33,480
I'm gonna go here.

1285
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:35,980
AI difficulty, super AI.

1286
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,460
Holy shit.

1287
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:40,600
That's the rank AI you've been fighting all along!

1288
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,820
Guys, I feel like we should...

1289
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:45,560
We should practice attack.

1290
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:46,540
Because we suck in attack.

1291
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:47,220
Let's go attack.

1292
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:47,960
Okay.

1293
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:50,540
Goodbye, AI bot 4.

1294
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:52,820
Trifor, come to attack.

1295
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,760
He wants to play with the bots.

1296
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:58,780
I think he's AFK.

1297
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,020
I'll practice defend.

1298
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,020
This is gonna help our team coordination!

1299
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:07,980
Trifor!

1300
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,160
We need to.

1301
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:12,640
There we go.

1302
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:13,800
Fuck.

1303
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:14,860
I tried to swap.

1304
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,100
Imagine we're just...

1305
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:23,260
We're trying to practice and this guy's just taking us down one by one.

1306
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:23,940
We're all like...

1307
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:26,400
Yeah.

1308
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,540
That's human element.

1309
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:28,820
Is this... oh, Madelina.

1310
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:29,780
Okay, I see Madelina.

1311
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:33,320
What am I... what am I playing?

1312
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,280
I was playing...

1313
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,820
What do I get to get rid of the other names?

1314
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:38,140
Trifor took my character, bro.

1315
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,320
What was your character?

1316
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:41,920
This one.

1317
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:43,300
Meredith.

1318
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:45,300
She's hot, so I'll play her.

1319
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:46,040
What the fuck?

1320
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:47,080
It's all about team comp!

1321
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:49,100
It's not about the hotness right now!

1322
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:49,460
Don't give a fuck.

1323
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:51,340
Scan knife?

1324
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:52,840
Okay, I'll play the scan knife, bitch.

1325
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:53,140
Fine.

1326
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:54,100
She's got a fat ass too.

1327
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:56,000
What?

1328
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,160
She's got the KO knife.

1329
00:39:58,300 --> 00:39:59,680
Wait, don't take frag grenade.

1330
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:00,380
Slow grenade.

1331
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:01,680
Oh, I fucked up.

1332
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,000
I fucked up.

1333
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:08,180
I forgot to swap my util, because you do it every time.

1334
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:09,900
I have a sniper rifle.

1335
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,520
Oh, you went for Kanami?

1336
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:13,520
She's good.

1337
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:14,620
I like her.

1338
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,160
Why did you say it like that?

1339
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:20,260
Yeah, it's a little creepy.

1340
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:20,680
She's not like her.

1341
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:21,920
That's a little creepy.

1342
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:23,820
She's hot.

1343
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,600
Okay, how do we... so how are we coordinating this?

1344
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,220
I can look at my ass.

1345
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:30,500
But the bots won't use nades though, so like what are we gonna practice?

1346
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:32,860
I guess our aim?

1347
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:33,200
True.

1348
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,880
Okay, but we can at least talk about like what we wanna do, you know?

1349
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:40,120
And set up like a remote plan, like a default?

1350
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:45,780
I will shoot my recon shorts and maybe shoot someone in head.

1351
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:47,720
Okay.

1352
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:51,040
I will just go like look middle a little bit and throw a knife over there.

1353
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:53,140
Whoa.

1354
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,240
Guys, I just scanned on point.

1355
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:57,400
She's got a turret.

1356
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,060
What the fuck?

1357
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:00,340
Yeah, that bot's got a turret.

1358
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:03,880
Oh my god, they're doing movement stuff.

1359
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:06,940
I missed everybody.

1360
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:07,780
Guys, these bots are crazy.

1361
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,360
What the fuck?

1362
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:10,380
You got destroyed.

1363
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:12,680
These bots are crazy.

1364
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:16,280
Guys, we didn't practice the take at all.

1365
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:18,220
Oh shit.

1366
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,900
Okay, you're right, you're right, you're right.

1367
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:20,800
These bots are crazy.

1368
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:21,180
Shoot in the head.

1369
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:22,720
Shoot in the head, sure.

1370
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,360
You're right, these bots are crazy.

1371
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:28,720
They're coming back.

1372
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:30,840
Oh no.

1373
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:32,780
Oh, wait, not...

1374
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:35,260
This sniper sucks in this game.

1375
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:41,320
I can't tell if it's fucking hit scan or projectile.

1376
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:52,780
I think we need to find someone for sure for that they can play.

1377
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,180
Nah, I can play once.

1378
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:56,760
I don't know how to play.

1379
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:01,280
I like the DMR characters, they just suck at close range.

1380
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:03,180
Mmm...

1381
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:06,060
DMR characters are good apparently because they have good abilities.

1382
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,800
Yeah, but they just suck at close range.

1383
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:11,080
So what do you want to play?

1384
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:12,980
Whatever.

1385
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:15,300
So play DMR then.

1386
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:16,460
Whatever we...

1387
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:18,360
That was the plan.

1388
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:19,040
What?

1389
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:23,920
Well, they just don't shoot as fast, that's why.

1390
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:25,380
Well, it's...

1391
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:27,220
They also have spread when you shift.

1392
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:28,820
Like a little bit.

1393
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:34,670
What are these AI thinking, dude?

1394
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:37,410
The absolute best.

1395
00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:38,050
No one's up there.

1396
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:38,490
No one's up there.

1397
00:42:38,570 --> 00:42:38,970
A is clear.

1398
00:42:40,610 --> 00:42:41,230
I got one.

1399
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:41,670
I'm pushing mid.

1400
00:42:43,850 --> 00:42:44,450
I'm sorry,

1401
00:42:48,330 --> 00:42:49,090
I missed every shot.

1402
00:42:49,110 --> 00:42:49,790
I fuck him up.

1403
00:42:49,870 --> 00:42:50,990
I fuck up the mail character.

1404
00:42:50,990 --> 00:42:51,630
I'm WESing.

1405
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:54,690
Got one down.

1406
00:42:54,870 --> 00:42:55,730
We got the WES.

1407
00:42:56,870 --> 00:42:57,930
I am planting.

1408
00:42:57,930 --> 00:42:59,210
I'm getting flanked.

1409
00:42:59,230 --> 00:43:02,070
I'm holding high ground for you.

1410
00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:04,370
I think they rez.

1411
00:43:04,530 --> 00:43:05,030
The guy killed.

1412
00:43:05,830 --> 00:43:07,310
Holy shit, they can do that?

1413
00:43:08,510 --> 00:43:09,690
Yeah, the bots are strong.

1414
00:43:10,690 --> 00:43:12,190
Oh my gosh, I see them.

1415
00:43:14,290 --> 00:43:15,290
They're low as fuck.

1416
00:43:15,570 --> 00:43:16,430
Two on next.

1417
00:43:17,450 --> 00:43:18,290
Down one.

1418
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:19,830
Down one of the bots.

1419
00:43:20,210 --> 00:43:20,450
Whoa!

1420
00:43:21,950 --> 00:43:23,030
Last guy's here.

1421
00:43:24,270 --> 00:43:24,750
Swear.

1422
00:43:25,210 --> 00:43:26,050
He's WESing.

1423
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:27,130
One HP.

1424
00:43:28,150 --> 00:43:30,890
Oh my god, I've been fucking with the DMR.

1425
00:43:31,010 --> 00:43:32,610
We're winning against bots.

1426
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:33,870
I'm so proud of us.

1427
00:43:34,610 --> 00:43:36,210
Maybe DMR is the play.

1428
00:43:37,630 --> 00:43:39,230
Oh my god, look at my skin.

1429
00:43:40,930 --> 00:43:41,950
Just look behind me.

1430
00:43:43,330 --> 00:43:44,470
I'm not gonna look.

1431
00:43:44,570 --> 00:43:45,170
I will not.

1432
00:43:45,450 --> 00:43:46,490
I will not look.

1433
00:43:46,670 --> 00:43:47,770
You got paid me to look.

1434
00:43:48,050 --> 00:43:49,570
In your pervertedness.

1435
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:50,490
You should look.

1436
00:43:50,650 --> 00:43:52,310
You need to pay me to look.

1437
00:43:52,610 --> 00:43:55,630
I'm gonna pay you to look at this.

1438
00:43:56,770 --> 00:43:57,910
We're all heading to mid.

1439
00:43:58,570 --> 00:44:00,230
We were all heading to B.

1440
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:01,250
I'm in B.

1441
00:44:01,850 --> 00:44:03,870
Oh my god.

1442
00:44:04,030 --> 00:44:04,550
You got it.

1443
00:44:04,570 --> 00:44:05,270
I'm already at A.

1444
00:44:06,730 --> 00:44:09,070
I'm gonna knife mid.

1445
00:44:09,170 --> 00:44:09,950
Let's go mid.

1446
00:44:10,030 --> 00:44:10,610
Let's go mid.

1447
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:13,990
Mid, he's got the turret.

1448
00:44:15,370 --> 00:44:16,150
Shoot them.

1449
00:44:17,310 --> 00:44:18,770
Oh wait, there's one more.

1450
00:44:18,890 --> 00:44:20,090
There's one on the high ground.

1451
00:44:20,770 --> 00:44:21,910
I'm shooting a donkey bird.

1452
00:44:22,010 --> 00:44:22,610
I'm shooting a donkey bird.

1453
00:44:23,570 --> 00:44:24,790
There's 7-2 on him.

1454
00:44:25,490 --> 00:44:27,630
This thing actually doesn't fucking work.

1455
00:44:27,930 --> 00:44:28,370
I'm crawling.

1456
00:44:28,410 --> 00:44:28,410
I'm crawling.

1457
00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:30,150
Wait, look at my... oh my god.

1458
00:44:30,990 --> 00:44:32,170
I need help.

1459
00:44:32,810 --> 00:44:33,710
I'm resing.

1460
00:44:33,710 --> 00:44:34,430
I'm resing too.

1461
00:44:35,290 --> 00:44:36,010
Help me.

1462
00:44:37,990 --> 00:44:38,690
Help me.

1463
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:40,290
Okay, give me a sec.

1464
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:43,610
And you said nade was not important.

1465
00:44:45,350 --> 00:44:46,090
I'm resing.

1466
00:44:46,110 --> 00:44:50,070
I fucking used that nade to save your life.

1467
00:44:51,410 --> 00:44:51,890
Nevermind.

1468
00:44:54,610 --> 00:44:56,370
I did not save my own life.

1469
00:44:57,310 --> 00:44:58,950
I literally resed you.

1470
00:44:59,070 --> 00:45:00,770
Okay, I'm not resing this guy again.

1471
00:45:05,730 --> 00:45:07,210
Why should I res you?

1472
00:45:07,310 --> 00:45:08,610
This is a fucking AI match.

1473
00:45:10,670 --> 00:45:12,170
Because you would have lost without me.

1474
00:45:12,730 --> 00:45:13,650
Where does my ult go?

1475
00:45:14,530 --> 00:45:17,230
Lavin creates a stealth zone and becomes invisible.

1476
00:45:17,630 --> 00:45:17,950
You literally have to...

1477
00:45:17,950 --> 00:45:19,050
You're literally bottom fragger.

1478
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:21,450
I can go invisible in this.

1479
00:45:21,650 --> 00:45:23,410
Yeah, look at his angle.

1480
00:45:23,410 --> 00:45:24,370
Run behind me.

1481
00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:24,930
Follow me.

1482
00:45:25,350 --> 00:45:25,790
Where?

1483
00:45:27,470 --> 00:45:27,910
Okay.

1484
00:45:30,690 --> 00:45:31,890
Do you see it?

1485
00:45:33,890 --> 00:45:34,330
What?

1486
00:45:36,790 --> 00:45:38,150
Dude, the skirt is going up.

1487
00:45:38,170 --> 00:45:39,230
You see our fucking cheeks?

1488
00:45:39,310 --> 00:45:39,850
It's crazy.

1489
00:45:40,790 --> 00:45:44,150
Guys, I got fucking demolished, but I ain't but fucking turrets in mid.

1490
00:45:46,170 --> 00:45:46,610
Banning.

1491
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:47,050
Smoking.

1492
00:45:47,170 --> 00:45:47,190
Oh.

1493
00:45:48,430 --> 00:45:49,850
My staking is going over.

1494
00:45:50,030 --> 00:45:50,610
I hit them.

1495
00:45:50,990 --> 00:45:53,270
Holy shit!

1496
00:45:53,410 --> 00:45:54,390
That's a lot of people.

1497
00:45:54,570 --> 00:45:56,050
Oh my god.

1498
00:45:57,250 --> 00:45:58,470
There's a lot of people there.

1499
00:45:59,470 --> 00:46:00,650
You need my goo?

1500
00:46:01,290 --> 00:46:01,810
Nice.

1501
00:46:02,210 --> 00:46:03,290
Okay, I'm coming.

1502
00:46:04,010 --> 00:46:04,210
There.

1503
00:46:04,370 --> 00:46:04,890
Big come.

1504
00:46:05,810 --> 00:46:06,050
Huh?

1505
00:46:06,910 --> 00:46:08,090
All three are there.

1506
00:46:08,090 --> 00:46:08,410
They're low.

1507
00:46:09,450 --> 00:46:09,970
One down.

1508
00:46:10,570 --> 00:46:11,090
One.

1509
00:46:13,530 --> 00:46:14,410
They're high ground.

1510
00:46:15,250 --> 00:46:16,470
I'm going here.

1511
00:46:17,210 --> 00:46:17,730
Yay!

1512
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:20,470
They're all 1 HP.

1513
00:46:21,170 --> 00:46:22,570
They're all 1 HP.

1514
00:46:23,410 --> 00:46:24,270
Big flank!

1515
00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:26,530
Okay, the paint lady is kind of strong.

1516
00:46:27,090 --> 00:46:29,150
Okay, this lady is insane.

1517
00:46:29,990 --> 00:46:30,530
Yes?

1518
00:46:33,770 --> 00:46:35,130
You can flash teammates?

1519
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:37,030
Yes, you can.

1520
00:46:37,730 --> 00:46:39,290
I can flash me in one game.

1521
00:46:39,790 --> 00:46:40,370
Yeah, you can.

1522
00:46:40,430 --> 00:46:40,770
You can.

1523
00:46:40,770 --> 00:46:42,250
You can 100% flash teammates.

1524
00:46:43,390 --> 00:46:44,310
Wait, this...

1525
00:46:45,350 --> 00:46:47,530
Did you just not trust me?

1526
00:46:47,570 --> 00:46:48,630
Or what's the problem here?

1527
00:46:50,030 --> 00:46:51,670
Who are you telling that to?

1528
00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:54,810
I was just reconfirming what you said.

1529
00:46:54,970 --> 00:46:56,710
Because someone else didn't trust me.

1530
00:46:56,710 --> 00:46:57,370
No, Trifor.

1531
00:46:58,370 --> 00:47:00,230
Trifor, why don't you trust RPR?

1532
00:47:01,390 --> 00:47:02,730
RPR is a victim.

1533
00:47:03,850 --> 00:47:04,330
What?

1534
00:47:04,430 --> 00:47:05,870
I am a victim right now.

1535
00:47:05,930 --> 00:47:08,730
I literally am a victim right now.

1536
00:47:08,730 --> 00:47:09,330
What the fuck?

1537
00:47:09,390 --> 00:47:10,250
It's not even me.

1538
00:47:11,230 --> 00:47:12,110
Don't worry about it.

1539
00:47:12,170 --> 00:47:13,310
It's like victim complex.

1540
00:47:14,050 --> 00:47:16,150
No, it's not a victim complex at all.

1541
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:16,490
I'm fine.

1542
00:47:16,950 --> 00:47:17,810
Oh shit.

1543
00:47:18,970 --> 00:47:20,070
What the fuck?

1544
00:47:20,110 --> 00:47:21,650
Why did you guys wind grenade in your face?

1545
00:47:21,670 --> 00:47:22,850
Oh, there's people on me.

1546
00:47:23,950 --> 00:47:24,630
All three.

1547
00:47:24,690 --> 00:47:25,330
All three are here.

1548
00:47:25,590 --> 00:47:26,030
I'm with you.

1549
00:47:26,090 --> 00:47:26,310
I'm with you.

1550
00:47:26,910 --> 00:47:28,870
I'm throwing this one over there.

1551
00:47:29,310 --> 00:47:29,710
Okay.

1552
00:47:31,450 --> 00:47:32,850
There was a sniper over there.

1553
00:47:33,590 --> 00:47:33,990
Wow!

1554
00:47:35,050 --> 00:47:35,710
I'm dead.

1555
00:47:36,790 --> 00:47:38,890
Guys, B is dead.

1556
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:39,470
Bro, what the fuck are you doing?

1557
00:47:40,450 --> 00:47:42,250
You didn't say it was more than one.

1558
00:47:42,790 --> 00:47:44,790
I said they were all down there.

1559
00:47:45,370 --> 00:47:45,470
Oh.

1560
00:47:47,010 --> 00:47:49,310
Why is he losing to AI, you fucking disgrace?

1561
00:47:50,570 --> 00:47:51,390
It's fine, bro.

1562
00:47:51,670 --> 00:47:52,470
We'll save this shit.

1563
00:47:52,710 --> 00:47:53,870
Don't worry, I got it.

1564
00:47:55,850 --> 00:47:56,810
All headshots.

1565
00:47:57,130 --> 00:47:57,850
All headshots.

1566
00:47:59,270 --> 00:48:01,310
Guys, shoot the little turrets as well.

1567
00:48:01,510 --> 00:48:02,250
Like, what are we doing?

1568
00:48:02,650 --> 00:48:07,510
None of us are taking this seriously right now against the AI match.

1569
00:48:08,890 --> 00:48:10,130
We're just fragging.

1570
00:48:10,310 --> 00:48:11,490
We're just practicing our aim.

1571
00:48:11,510 --> 00:48:13,750
We're not even practicing teamwork.

1572
00:48:14,890 --> 00:48:17,370
We're practicing something's being practiced.

1573
00:48:17,610 --> 00:48:18,950
Like, this character is good.

1574
00:48:20,890 --> 00:48:23,150
We should do an A execute.

1575
00:48:23,410 --> 00:48:26,170
Through mid, out, IV, through connector.

1576
00:48:26,450 --> 00:48:26,570
Who has the smoke?

1577
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:27,090
Wait, who has the smoke?

1578
00:48:27,470 --> 00:48:29,490
RPH, you're not shotcalling.

1579
00:48:30,370 --> 00:48:32,030
Do you know how to smoke that, like, fast?

1580
00:48:32,210 --> 00:48:32,630
Figure it out.

1581
00:48:32,870 --> 00:48:34,090
I don't know how to smoke.

1582
00:48:34,730 --> 00:48:40,670
I feel like we shouldn't go, like, actual A or B.

1583
00:48:41,110 --> 00:48:41,810
I'm blind.

1584
00:48:41,830 --> 00:48:43,170
We should go mid?

1585
00:48:43,430 --> 00:48:44,350
Wait, Nix, what did he say?

1586
00:48:44,570 --> 00:48:46,730
Yeah, mid seems like a good play.

1587
00:48:47,170 --> 00:48:48,930
Yeah, but I feel like we're not gonna be on this mid.

1588
00:48:48,950 --> 00:48:50,150
We're gonna be on a different map.

1589
00:48:51,070 --> 00:48:52,770
Well, another map seems like a good play.

1590
00:48:53,150 --> 00:48:53,570
It's true.

1591
00:48:55,650 --> 00:48:56,430
I'm doing that.

1592
00:48:56,470 --> 00:48:57,710
No, she's aimbotting.

1593
00:48:57,770 --> 00:48:58,450
I'm free res.

1594
00:49:00,010 --> 00:49:00,930
Oh my god.

1595
00:49:00,950 --> 00:49:02,130
There's like turrets here.

1596
00:49:02,570 --> 00:49:03,330
I'm free res.

1597
00:49:03,470 --> 00:49:03,850
I'm free res.

1598
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:05,010
Yeah?

1599
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:05,910
You wanna say that again?

1600
00:49:07,530 --> 00:49:09,470
Oh yeah, what a useless fucking teammate.

1601
00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:12,530
Oh yeah, like the time you did in Res Miare?

1602
00:49:14,030 --> 00:49:15,870
It was the It was the end of the round.

1603
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:18,810
It doesn't matter.

1604
00:49:19,010 --> 00:49:19,210
It doesn't matter.

1605
00:49:19,210 --> 00:49:19,950
You didn't Res.

1606
00:49:20,690 --> 00:49:22,410
You got this your I believe in you.

1607
00:49:24,230 --> 00:49:25,870
The bullet went through them!

1608
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:28,670
He healed, he healed, he healed.

1609
00:49:28,790 --> 00:49:29,870
The snipers are inconsistent!

1610
00:49:35,510 --> 00:49:36,370
The snipers are inconsistent!

1611
00:49:36,370 --> 00:49:37,430
Hey man, at least you look pretty.

1612
00:49:37,730 --> 00:49:39,430
Hey, at least now you know you won't play this character.

1613
00:49:39,430 --> 00:49:40,470
Everyone saw that, right?

1614
00:49:40,530 --> 00:49:41,910
That caster was on that bit.

1615
00:49:42,190 --> 00:49:43,610
At least we know you won't play this character.

1616
00:49:46,270 --> 00:49:47,250
Look straight up.

1617
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:48,010
Solda Ero.

1618
00:49:54,670 --> 00:49:56,730
Oh, there you go, there you go!

1619
00:49:56,990 --> 00:49:57,650
You're gaming!

1620
00:49:59,810 --> 00:50:01,790
Granger, you're so fucked.

1621
00:50:02,890 --> 00:50:05,470
You're so fucked, bro.

1622
00:50:05,890 --> 00:50:08,470
Oh, the whiff!

1623
00:50:10,870 --> 00:50:12,450
Everyone's seen that shit, right?

1624
00:50:12,650 --> 00:50:13,470
That shit!

1625
00:50:13,610 --> 00:50:14,710
It's going through them!

1626
00:50:15,630 --> 00:50:17,550
Bro, you have another gun!

1627
00:50:17,730 --> 00:50:19,470
Why don't you get your other gun?

1628
00:50:19,630 --> 00:50:25,990
Cause I'm trying to see how this bullshit gun works, but half the time these bullets just more through these motherfuckers.

1629
00:50:27,530 --> 00:50:28,430
So bad.

1630
00:50:33,820 --> 00:50:37,160
Let's do a, uh, let's do something... nah, fucking whatever.

1631
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:39,480
I give up.

1632
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:44,300
I give up mid-talk, bro.

1633
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:44,880
I'm over it.

1634
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:48,960
How many more minutes till our next match?

1635
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:50,780
Nine.

1636
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:51,540
Nine minutes.

1637
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:52,640
Nine minutes.

1638
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:53,560
Yippee!

1639
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:56,460
Solda Ero going out.

1640
00:50:57,580 --> 00:50:59,140
She's on the turret again!

1641
00:50:59,580 --> 00:51:00,360
It's a bot!

1642
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:01,680
She'll always be on the turret!

1643
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:02,920
I slowed her.

1644
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:05,200
How is she so good at movement?

1645
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:08,040
It's a fucking code.

1646
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:12,120
The code's better than us.

1647
00:51:14,740 --> 00:51:15,540
No shit.

1648
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:15,900
No shit.

1649
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:17,320
Oh, there's a guy right here.

1650
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:17,540
Hello.

1651
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:20,040
Yeah, I trusted you.

1652
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:21,300
Oh.

1653
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:23,300
Don't hold me, alright?

1654
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:25,440
87.

1655
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:27,880
Don't trust anyone, not even yourself.

1656
00:51:28,820 --> 00:51:29,960
My grenade's there next.

1657
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,240
If you get hit by it, it's your fault.

1658
00:51:32,220 --> 00:51:34,000
I don't think you actually...

1659
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,200
Guys, I'm getting shh.

1660
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:38,280
Wait, we should experiment and see if nades hurt each other.

1661
00:51:38,380 --> 00:51:39,740
Like the frag grenades.

1662
00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:41,840
Alright, who wants to test mine?

1663
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:43,140
Okay, I'll test it.

1664
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:45,220
No, you can't hurt each other with those things.

1665
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:45,820
With frag grenades?

1666
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:47,280
I know you can flash each other.

1667
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:50,680
Yeah, I don't think you can do team damage in any form.

1668
00:51:51,260 --> 00:51:52,560
Oh, okay, that's great.

1669
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:54,080
Throwing himself.

1670
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:58,180
I'm just gonna test it now.

1671
00:51:58,540 --> 00:51:59,760
Yeah, it needs to be tested.

1672
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:00,840
Just to be sure.

1673
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:04,080
Just to be sure.

1674
00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:07,220
I only listen to level 30s.

1675
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:10,620
I'm level 5.

1676
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:13,840
That's why we're not listening to you.

1677
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:17,140
There's a goose low.

1678
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:20,180
Your own nades do hurt you.

1679
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:21,000
It does?

1680
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:21,880
Yeah, but they don't hurt me.

1681
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:23,220
Okay, wait, does it hurt?

1682
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:25,800
I'm gonna throw my nade on you.

1683
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:27,420
We just tried it.

1684
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:28,580
I took 0 damage.

1685
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:29,860
Oh, yeah.

1686
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:32,800
No one ever trusts me, bro.

1687
00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:33,860
You're not level 30.

1688
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:37,100
He's not level 30 either.

1689
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:37,980
What are we doing about?

1690
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:40,200
We're confirming for each other.

1691
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:41,740
I threw the nade.

1692
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:42,920
Yeah, yeah.

1693
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:44,680
I got a donkey bull shooting at me.

1694
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,140
A donkey bull shooting at you?

1695
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:49,600
She is that, but I'm definitely...

1696
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:51,640
I have a res 2...

1697
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:52,860
Oh, wait, you have that?

1698
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:53,200
Nice.

1699
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:53,720
Yeah, yeah.

1700
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:56,720
Yeah.

1701
00:52:59,140 --> 00:53:00,280
Dude, we got this easy.

1702
00:53:00,820 --> 00:53:02,140
Yeah, I mean, I bought this skin.

1703
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:04,380
Now I'm cack girl.

1704
00:53:06,940 --> 00:53:07,980
Okay, so what...

1705
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:10,000
Oh, I need to swap my util.

1706
00:53:10,180 --> 00:53:11,140
I keep forgetting that.

1707
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:14,140
Okay, so what grenade do we need?

1708
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:18,980
You need the wind storm and slow grenade, apparently.

1709
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:19,300
Okay.

1710
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:21,800
So healing grenade doesn't matter.

1711
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:26,460
Interceptor nade is also good if you want like a club watson basically.

1712
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:27,660
All right.

1713
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:31,180
I'll do interceptor and wind grenade.

1714
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:34,360
It's good if they want to throw smoke.

1715
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:37,840
If they throw smokes on site, you just throw that shit and just delete all the smokes when they throw them.

1716
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:39,660
Wait, do you have to do it before or after?

1717
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:41,400
Before, before it's like watson gen.

1718
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:43,160
Big boob.

1719
00:53:44,060 --> 00:53:44,660
All right.

1720
00:53:44,980 --> 00:53:48,640
Have you figured out what character you want to play now, Chirp4?

1721
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:52,840
Playing the guy with DMR.

1722
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:52,980
Playing the guy with DMR.

1723
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:54,640
Because I think after this game, we have to...

1724
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:56,360
We're going to the next match, right?

1725
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:57,660
I play.

1726
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:00,100
You want to play?

1727
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:00,920
Let's play.

1728
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:01,340
You want to play?

1729
00:54:01,340 --> 00:54:01,340
Let's play.

1730
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:03,000
You want to play?

1731
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Let's play.

1732
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:09,780
But see more anime.

1733
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:13,120
You want to play?

1734
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:14,040
Let's play.

1735
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:15,520
You want to play?

1736
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:15,520
Let's play.

1737
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:15,800
Okay, no.

1738
00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:16,780
We're going to do it now.

1739
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:19,000
Bro.

1740
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:21,340
Bro.

1741
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:25,180
Oh my god.

1742
00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:25,940
They're mid.

1743
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:27,960
I killed one.

1744
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:28,520
I killed one.

1745
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:29,080
I killed one.

1746
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:33,500
You said do it more anime.

1747
00:54:33,740 --> 00:54:34,000
Yeah.

1748
00:54:37,420 --> 00:54:38,720
I did say that.

1749
00:54:38,740 --> 00:54:39,080
I did say that.

1750
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:40,180
I won't practice my fucking D.

1751
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:41,660
Yeah, I won't practice my D.

1752
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:43,980
Yeah, one guy mid very low.

1753
00:54:44,060 --> 00:54:44,720
There you go.

1754
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:46,620
Right here.

1755
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:51,480
Guys, look at the ping on IPN.

1756
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:52,540
Guys, look at the ping on IPN.

1757
00:54:52,540 --> 00:54:53,560
What's IPN's ping?

1758
00:54:54,540 --> 00:54:55,360
160 words.

1759
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:55,980
Dude, they're paper.

1760
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:56,840
I can't hit them.

1761
00:54:57,340 --> 00:54:58,200
Oh shit.

1762
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:00,040
Oh yeah, we also need to use paper more, guys.

1763
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:00,840
Yeah, I am.

1764
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:08,400
I'm not going to use less paper.

1765
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:10,360
I'm going to use less paper.

1766
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:13,840
I'm going to use less paper.

1767
00:55:15,140 --> 00:55:16,920
I did not just watch you do that.

1768
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:19,160
That was terrible.

1769
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:21,200
I heard use more paper.

1770
00:55:21,340 --> 00:55:23,980
So I just listened to my ITL.

1771
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:25,480
So you jumped into an 8.

1772
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:27,600
Yeah, I listened to my ITL.

1773
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:29,740
Use more paper.

1774
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:31,300
The paper's into an 8.

1775
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:32,200
Got it, guys.

1776
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:35,280
You did not specify anything.

1777
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:38,760
Do I have to tell you not to die?

1778
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:39,460
Yes.

1779
00:55:39,980 --> 00:55:41,280
Just stay alive.

1780
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:42,880
I didn't see the grenade.

1781
00:55:42,980 --> 00:55:44,720
Nobody said anything about the grenade.

1782
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:46,140
I didn't see it.

1783
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:47,040
Alright.

1784
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:50,480
It's everyone's fault but yours.

1785
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:53,300
Yep, I'm the main character.

1786
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:57,260
I've been spotted.

1787
00:55:57,420 --> 00:55:58,020
It's A.

1788
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:00,420
Guys, use your grenades.

1789
00:56:00,420 --> 00:56:00,940
Use your grenades.

1790
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:03,980
Owwwwwwwww.

1791
00:56:05,140 --> 00:56:06,620
You got shot by...

1792
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:07,700
AI.

1793
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:10,380
I got shot by a 3 and M.

1794
00:56:10,540 --> 00:56:11,700
I got shot by a 3 and M.

1795
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:12,340
Bro.

1796
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:15,660
I got to raise you here.

1797
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:16,760
How did you die?

1798
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:20,480
Oh, we're getting pushed.

1799
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:22,120
What?

1800
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:24,040
What?

1801
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:24,500
No.

1802
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:28,420
These guys are way better at executing than we are.

1803
00:56:28,860 --> 00:56:29,980
Thank God.

1804
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:32,880
They're not even talking to each other.

1805
00:56:33,020 --> 00:56:35,320
They actually like push as a team and shit.

1806
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:37,180
Wait, did you just turn and go in?

1807
00:56:39,860 --> 00:56:41,140
What is that like?

1808
00:56:41,140 --> 00:56:43,840
What is that like?

1809
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:44,060
What is that like?

1810
00:56:44,060 --> 00:56:46,020
These guys three men pushed at the same time.

1811
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:47,920
These guys three men pushed at the same time.

1812
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:47,980
That's crazy.

1813
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:50,760
There's a lot we can learn from these bots, man.

1814
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:53,280
Why don't we...

1815
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:55,560
Why don't we work together as a team?

1816
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:56,680
I don't understand.

1817
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:57,840
I don't...

1818
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:00,400
We all play as bots.

1819
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:01,260
We play team games.

1820
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:03,000
Overwatch is a team game.

1821
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:05,260
Why don't we work together?

1822
00:57:05,340 --> 00:57:05,720
I blame you.

1823
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:09,620
They three men swung my ass.

1824
00:57:10,580 --> 00:57:12,360
We should do that also, by the way.

1825
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:13,900
That's the best way to win a fight.

1826
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,260
To swing with as many numbers as possible.

1827
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:18,360
I didn't set my turrets.

1828
00:57:18,460 --> 00:57:19,280
I forgot to.

1829
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:21,160
I'm gonna do it next.

1830
00:57:21,460 --> 00:57:22,220
Don't die.

1831
00:57:22,260 --> 00:57:23,820
My turret is coming over.

1832
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:26,600
Oh, yeah.

1833
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:27,720
It is me.

1834
00:57:28,420 --> 00:57:29,700
Don't worry.

1835
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:31,180
I have my...

1836
00:57:31,180 --> 00:57:32,280
He's dead.

1837
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:35,820
I have my interceptor.

1838
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:37,280
How far is...

1839
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:39,520
Someone went mid.

1840
00:57:39,740 --> 00:57:42,940
It was not just me, but also mid.

1841
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:48,190
She's flying.

1842
00:57:49,210 --> 00:57:50,730
Over here.

1843
00:57:51,490 --> 00:57:52,830
I pinged them.

1844
00:57:53,250 --> 00:57:53,870
I can't.

1845
00:57:54,070 --> 00:57:55,610
Are you f**king...

1846
00:57:57,930 --> 00:57:59,190
Use your n*****.

1847
00:57:59,970 --> 00:58:01,090
Why do you have a normal n*****?

1848
00:58:01,090 --> 00:58:01,490
Why do you have a normal n*****?

1849
00:58:03,310 --> 00:58:04,370
But they're flying.

1850
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:06,170
Woah.

1851
00:58:10,030 --> 00:58:10,510
Oh.

1852
00:58:11,410 --> 00:58:12,270
We won.

1853
00:58:12,410 --> 00:58:12,890
Yay.

1854
00:58:13,910 --> 00:58:15,710
Wow, we still have two more rounds.

1855
00:58:16,470 --> 00:58:18,710
Guys, we still have two more rounds, guys.

1856
00:58:22,390 --> 00:58:24,010
Wait, isn't our match starting?

1857
00:58:25,070 --> 00:58:25,970
After this game.

1858
00:58:25,970 --> 00:58:27,150
Yeah, the admins said they're gonna...

1859
00:58:27,150 --> 00:58:29,110
They're gonna come pick us up.

1860
00:58:29,370 --> 00:58:31,550
They know we're special in the head, so...

1861
00:58:31,550 --> 00:58:31,850
Yeah.

1862
00:58:32,750 --> 00:58:36,530
Who are we fighting against next game?

1863
00:58:36,910 --> 00:58:38,450
What are we fighting for?

1864
00:58:39,270 --> 00:58:41,410
Will they be easier or harder?

1865
00:58:42,630 --> 00:58:44,230
I can't believe...

1866
00:58:44,230 --> 00:58:46,390
I can't believe we even won our first round.

1867
00:58:46,570 --> 00:58:52,210
To be fair, I saw that in the tournament, some of the players are like top 100 Valorant players.

1868
00:58:52,410 --> 00:58:52,930
Guys.

1869
00:58:54,230 --> 00:58:55,070
So are we f**ked?

1870
00:58:55,070 --> 00:58:55,590
We have...

1871
00:58:55,590 --> 00:58:59,010
We have four ex-pro players in this team.

1872
00:58:59,150 --> 00:58:59,270
We have four ex-pro players in this team.

1873
00:58:59,330 --> 00:59:00,690
Don't even play Valorant.

1874
00:59:00,710 --> 00:59:02,250
Don't even play Valorant.

1875
00:59:03,250 --> 00:59:04,530
I've played Valorant once.

1876
00:59:06,070 --> 00:59:08,230
What's... How many C's does Valorant have?

1877
00:59:09,470 --> 00:59:10,310
What's... How many C's does Valorant have?

1878
00:59:10,550 --> 00:59:11,090
They're on A.

1879
00:59:11,110 --> 00:59:11,550
They're on A, guys.

1880
00:59:11,570 --> 00:59:11,990
They're f**ked up.

1881
00:59:12,830 --> 00:59:17,110
Are they already in?

1882
00:59:17,170 --> 00:59:17,510
I'm ulting.

1883
00:59:19,010 --> 00:59:20,790
We got one kill too.

1884
00:59:21,390 --> 00:59:22,250
On our end.

1885
00:59:23,770 --> 00:59:24,590
I'm heading over.

1886
00:59:26,170 --> 00:59:26,610
Whoa.

1887
00:59:26,950 --> 00:59:27,930
Be careful.

1888
00:59:28,950 --> 00:59:30,090
Is this RL?

1889
00:59:32,650 --> 00:59:34,450
I think I'm a fake.

1890
00:59:34,650 --> 00:59:35,630
I don't know where...

1891
00:59:35,630 --> 00:59:36,810
They're gonna come from.

1892
00:59:36,870 --> 00:59:37,170
On me.

1893
00:59:39,510 --> 00:59:40,710
Hope he knocks you.

1894
00:59:40,810 --> 00:59:41,510
This is my win.

1895
00:59:41,850 --> 00:59:44,710
Me next, Taemin.

1896
00:59:47,870 --> 00:59:48,850
Last is the sniper.

1897
00:59:49,010 --> 00:59:49,870
We can't lose to the sniper.

1898
00:59:50,270 --> 00:59:52,590
My win grenade killed me.

1899
00:59:54,190 --> 00:59:55,030
Sniper is useful.

1900
00:59:56,390 --> 00:59:58,030
I'm pushing the sniper.

1901
00:59:58,350 --> 00:59:59,630
I was stuck in a win grenade.

1902
01:00:00,070 --> 01:00:00,350
Go RPR.

1903
01:00:00,370 --> 01:00:02,450
Go RPR.

1904
01:00:02,790 --> 01:00:03,670
You're doing it.

1905
01:00:04,590 --> 01:00:05,970
You guys are doing it.

1906
01:00:08,170 --> 01:00:09,330
What does this do?

1907
01:00:09,670 --> 01:00:10,730
What is that all?

1908
01:00:10,750 --> 01:00:13,410
She pulls you in and makes you die.

1909
01:00:13,890 --> 01:00:13,990
Oh.

1910
01:00:14,990 --> 01:00:17,970
Guys, one last game before we play a real game.

1911
01:00:18,570 --> 01:00:19,210
Oh no.

1912
01:00:20,330 --> 01:00:21,270
Why oh no?

1913
01:00:22,210 --> 01:00:22,730
Okay.

1914
01:00:23,750 --> 01:00:27,030
I don't think Nex believes in us guys.

1915
01:00:27,410 --> 01:00:29,830
I don't think he believes in us.

1916
01:00:30,030 --> 01:00:31,750
Honestly, can I even blame him at this point?

1917
01:00:32,790 --> 01:00:34,630
You literally made this team.

1918
01:00:35,450 --> 01:00:37,910
All I'm saying is I'm top damn in this bot match.

1919
01:00:38,150 --> 01:00:40,390
Yeah, I made this team, but you always did.

1920
01:00:40,790 --> 01:00:42,090
Oh my god.

1921
01:00:42,310 --> 01:00:44,810
Top damage in an AI match.

1922
01:00:45,930 --> 01:00:48,130
I think we know who's not the problem.

1923
01:00:51,350 --> 01:00:54,630
I feel like in FFVII, what charm does like being the deepest you want to guys?

1924
01:00:54,630 --> 01:00:55,510
I have max damage.

1925
01:00:57,010 --> 01:00:58,470
Yeah, I'm gold medals.

1926
01:00:58,570 --> 01:00:59,070
They're coming.

1927
01:00:59,110 --> 01:00:59,790
They are.

1928
01:01:02,530 --> 01:01:04,010
I threw my turret.

1929
01:01:05,590 --> 01:01:06,030
Enemy.

1930
01:01:06,370 --> 01:01:08,570
This is their kill joy up.

1931
01:01:09,630 --> 01:01:10,310
Bomb down.

1932
01:01:13,770 --> 01:01:15,310
Are you guys okay over there?

1933
01:01:15,430 --> 01:01:16,370
There's a kill joy up.

1934
01:01:17,730 --> 01:01:18,170
Everyone.

1935
01:01:20,970 --> 01:01:23,590
Oh hey, my turret is, Oh shit!

1936
01:01:23,650 --> 01:01:24,950
Okay, I did not see that guy.

1937
01:01:26,470 --> 01:01:26,950
Yeah!

1938
01:01:26,950 --> 01:01:27,990
I'm the best!

1939
01:01:28,390 --> 01:01:28,870
Yeah!

1940
01:01:31,170 --> 01:01:32,250
This is a good game.

1941
01:01:32,490 --> 01:01:33,750
We're not playing the same map already.

1942
01:01:33,910 --> 01:01:35,730
No, and each map is different.

1943
01:01:36,010 --> 01:01:36,790
Each match.

1944
01:01:37,030 --> 01:01:38,510
Because I found some nice places too.

1945
01:01:39,690 --> 01:01:41,770
You're so good at this bot.

1946
01:01:41,950 --> 01:01:42,570
Thank you.

1947
01:01:43,290 --> 01:01:45,710
Look at me, second to MVP.

1948
01:01:45,950 --> 01:01:46,910
Second to MVP.

1949
01:01:47,010 --> 01:01:47,770
Look at me guys.

1950
01:01:47,790 --> 01:01:48,770
Not the problem.

1951
01:01:48,770 --> 01:01:49,850
Oh wow, against the boss.

1952
01:01:49,850 --> 01:01:51,070
Look at the last place.

1953
01:01:51,370 --> 01:01:52,270
Donkey bird.

1954
01:01:52,510 --> 01:01:52,970
Problem.

1955
01:01:53,510 --> 01:01:54,670
Think about it this way.

1956
01:01:54,750 --> 01:01:55,810
Those bots have aimbot.

1957
01:01:56,010 --> 01:01:56,990
I'm better than aimbot.

1958
01:01:57,750 --> 01:01:58,950
You know what, surefer.

1959
01:01:58,990 --> 01:02:00,770
I'm gonna give you a like over here.

1960
01:02:00,870 --> 01:02:01,470
Thank you.

1961
01:02:01,890 --> 01:02:02,770
Thank you.

1962
01:02:05,350 --> 01:02:05,850
Hello.

1963
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:07,390
Hello.

1964
01:02:07,490 --> 01:02:07,870
Perfect time to call.

1965
01:02:08,450 --> 01:02:09,650
How is everyone doing?

1966
01:02:10,670 --> 01:02:11,170
Amazing.

1967
01:02:11,170 --> 01:02:11,990
We just won our game.

1968
01:02:12,050 --> 01:02:12,890
These guys don't depress.

1969
01:02:14,070 --> 01:02:15,090
That is nice.

1970
01:02:15,350 --> 01:02:17,070
Okay, so current situation.

1971
01:02:17,670 --> 01:02:21,990
The current game that is handling right now is going in a bit over time.

1972
01:02:22,270 --> 01:02:23,690
So we will...

1973
01:02:23,690 --> 01:02:27,210
They started hella late is what you're saying.

1974
01:02:27,810 --> 01:02:30,410
They did start hella late.

1975
01:02:30,510 --> 01:02:33,330
And then they're also really really close right now.

1976
01:02:33,390 --> 01:02:34,970
The game is really really close.

1977
01:02:35,210 --> 01:02:36,050
How did they do that?

1978
01:02:36,590 --> 01:02:39,690
How are they going so close?

1979
01:02:40,210 --> 01:02:41,150
I don't know.

1980
01:02:41,590 --> 01:02:43,510
Yeah, ours was so fast.

1981
01:02:43,830 --> 01:02:44,530
How come...

1982
01:02:44,530 --> 01:02:46,810
Well, that's because they started hella late.

1983
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:48,870
They started about like...

1984
01:02:50,010 --> 01:02:51,070
8 minutes late.

1985
01:02:51,150 --> 01:02:51,610
So...

1986
01:02:51,610 --> 01:02:53,410
We should disqualify both teams.

1987
01:02:53,410 --> 01:02:54,170
Yeah, legit.

1988
01:02:54,570 --> 01:02:56,870
Wasn't there a penalty for like if they're late?

1989
01:02:57,090 --> 01:02:57,570
Look...

1990
01:02:57,570 --> 01:02:58,450
I remember that.

1991
01:02:58,450 --> 01:02:59,090
I read the rules.

1992
01:02:59,310 --> 01:02:59,810
Don't shoot the messenger, okay?

1993
01:03:00,550 --> 01:03:01,810
One of the teams...

1994
01:03:01,810 --> 01:03:04,040
One of the teams is called Skippity Rizzler.

1995
01:03:04,470 --> 01:03:05,310
I read the rules.

1996
01:03:05,450 --> 01:03:06,570
You guys were like...

1997
01:03:06,570 --> 01:03:07,270
We will...

1998
01:03:08,090 --> 01:03:10,550
We will penalize teams that are late.

1999
01:03:12,410 --> 01:03:13,490
I'm eating my food.

2000
01:03:14,850 --> 01:03:16,870
I can't do nothing about that.

2001
01:03:16,970 --> 01:03:18,450
Okay, the names are as it is.

2002
01:03:18,450 --> 01:03:19,450
Okay, but...

2003
01:03:19,450 --> 01:03:21,990
Listen, if you don't disqualify, we're gonna blame you.

2004
01:03:23,190 --> 01:03:27,450
Wait, I like how you censor yourself, but we're all like fucking swearing already.

2005
01:03:27,610 --> 01:03:28,310
So, yeah.

2006
01:03:29,070 --> 01:03:30,230
We all heard fuck.

2007
01:03:31,230 --> 01:03:32,390
So, like, it doesn't matter.

2008
01:03:32,870 --> 01:03:34,530
Because they have to censor it anyway.

2009
01:03:35,050 --> 01:03:37,630
I have a plug in that auto-censors my...

2010
01:03:37,630 --> 01:03:37,990
Oh!

2011
01:03:37,990 --> 01:03:38,710
No way.

2012
01:03:38,810 --> 01:03:39,170
That's...

2013
01:03:39,170 --> 01:03:41,610
So, if I just like regular talking, I go, fuck, shit.

2014
01:03:42,590 --> 01:03:43,270
Wait, what?

2015
01:03:43,470 --> 01:03:44,270
No way.

2016
01:03:44,550 --> 01:03:45,770
How do you do that?

2017
01:03:47,510 --> 01:03:47,950
So...

2018
01:03:47,950 --> 01:03:48,430
I'm just like...

2019
01:03:48,430 --> 01:03:49,150
That's insane.

2020
01:03:49,450 --> 01:03:50,130
That's crazy.

2021
01:03:50,130 --> 01:03:52,270
We gotta stay family friendly for the Twitch viewers, you know?

2022
01:03:52,370 --> 01:03:53,470
Wait, you can do that?

2023
01:03:53,710 --> 01:03:54,990
Yeah, you can do that?

2024
01:03:56,550 --> 01:03:57,310
We need that.

2025
01:03:57,370 --> 01:03:58,630
Lord knows I need that.

2026
01:03:59,670 --> 01:04:01,850
Don't get demonetized for swearing.

2027
01:04:03,190 --> 01:04:04,210
Yeah, no, no.

2028
01:04:04,250 --> 01:04:06,230
No demonetization here.

2029
01:04:06,430 --> 01:04:07,670
I need to get my AdSense.

2030
01:04:08,410 --> 01:04:08,970
It's okay.

2031
01:04:09,030 --> 01:04:10,030
We'll swear for you.

2032
01:04:10,890 --> 01:04:14,250
So, your editors will have to edit our censors for us.

2033
01:04:14,250 --> 01:04:15,310
Wait, I'm not allowed to swear?

2034
01:04:15,810 --> 01:04:16,870
No, you're allowed...

2035
01:04:16,870 --> 01:04:18,410
Be passionate, shorty.

2036
01:04:18,410 --> 01:04:18,610
You're allowed to swear if you want to.

2037
01:04:18,610 --> 01:04:18,770
We're not allowed to swear for you.

2038
01:04:19,350 --> 01:04:19,710
We're allowed to swear for you.

2039
01:04:19,710 --> 01:04:21,670
Okay, no, actually, don't say anything you ever want to say.

2040
01:04:23,870 --> 01:04:25,310
Don't say anything you want.

2041
01:04:25,550 --> 01:04:28,070
Actually, do not swear for me.

2042
01:04:28,930 --> 01:04:30,490
You need limiters.

2043
01:04:30,770 --> 01:04:30,970
Let me tell you.

2044
01:04:30,970 --> 01:04:32,330
You do not...

2045
01:04:32,330 --> 01:04:33,290
What do you mean I need limiters?

2046
01:04:33,490 --> 01:04:34,870
...say everything that you want.

2047
01:04:35,430 --> 01:04:36,130
Listen guys.

2048
01:04:36,170 --> 01:04:38,830
If I had that bleep function, my stream would literally be this.

2049
01:04:41,730 --> 01:04:43,750
It's just your fucking bloodlining.

2050
01:04:44,530 --> 01:04:45,230
It's okay.

2051
01:04:45,390 --> 01:04:45,810
It's okay.

2052
01:04:46,110 --> 01:04:47,670
We just send Morse code, you know?

2053
01:04:47,930 --> 01:04:48,390
Look, I'm not gonna lie.

2054
01:04:49,690 --> 01:04:50,570
Oh, no!

2055
01:04:53,550 --> 01:04:54,650
I need a translator.

2056
01:04:55,330 --> 01:04:57,990
Alright, so I will get you guys ready for the next match.

2057
01:04:58,130 --> 01:04:59,250
The code should be ready.

2058
01:04:59,630 --> 01:05:00,530
Looks like...

2059
01:05:00,530 --> 01:05:01,490
You can't show it on stream, right?

2060
01:05:01,870 --> 01:05:03,030
I'm gonna go take a piss.

2061
01:05:03,750 --> 01:05:05,490
Okay, the game has just concluded.

2062
01:05:05,810 --> 01:05:06,190
Yay!

2063
01:05:06,550 --> 01:05:08,710
Dragged him over to our game now.

2064
01:05:09,670 --> 01:05:11,330
How do you leave a custom match?

2065
01:05:12,370 --> 01:05:15,610
You just have to leave on the bottom right.

2066
01:05:15,610 --> 01:05:18,730
Are we facing the winning team or the losing team?

2067
01:05:19,450 --> 01:05:21,230
You guys are facing the winning team.

2068
01:05:21,390 --> 01:05:21,590
Oh.

2069
01:05:21,910 --> 01:05:22,390
Fuck!

2070
01:05:22,390 --> 01:05:22,770
Let's go!

2071
01:05:23,050 --> 01:05:23,470
Let's go!

2072
01:05:25,090 --> 01:05:26,030
Guys, it's okay.

2073
01:05:26,090 --> 01:05:27,110
This is round robin day.

2074
01:05:27,290 --> 01:05:28,630
So like it doesn't matter.

2075
01:05:28,870 --> 01:05:30,210
Cause... right?

2076
01:05:31,290 --> 01:05:35,550
Wait, you're gonna be overconfident coming from a win and that's when we're gonna get him.

2077
01:05:35,770 --> 01:05:38,850
Yeah, this is the round robin... round robin day.

2078
01:05:39,110 --> 01:05:39,590
Okay.

2079
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:44,550
If these guys started eight minutes late...

2080
01:05:44,550 --> 01:05:45,590
And it lasted...

2081
01:05:45,610 --> 01:05:46,550
And it lasted that long...

2082
01:05:46,550 --> 01:05:49,330
That means these guys are waiting until there's like 30 seconds left.

2083
01:05:49,350 --> 01:05:49,670
Oh yeah, true.

2084
01:05:49,670 --> 01:05:50,990
We can execute every round.

2085
01:05:51,270 --> 01:05:52,090
Oh, dude.

2086
01:05:52,450 --> 01:05:52,930
Waiters.

2087
01:05:52,930 --> 01:05:53,950
They're gonna be cringe.

2088
01:05:54,190 --> 01:05:58,190
So aggressiveness might be good against them cause they're not gonna expect like...

2089
01:05:58,190 --> 01:05:59,150
To get far.

2090
01:05:59,490 --> 01:06:01,150
Dumbasses to just run in.

2091
01:06:01,710 --> 01:06:02,550
Yeah, I gotta...

2092
01:06:02,550 --> 01:06:04,870
We gotta hide screen and don't show this part.

2093
01:06:04,950 --> 01:06:05,430
We're so...

2094
01:06:05,430 --> 01:06:06,190
We're dumb.

2095
01:06:08,890 --> 01:06:09,910
Free for yourself.

2096
01:06:10,390 --> 01:06:11,110
I'm smart.

2097
01:06:12,630 --> 01:06:14,710
If you're so smart, why are we losing?

2098
01:06:16,290 --> 01:06:16,970
It's not a bot.

2099
01:06:17,830 --> 01:06:19,090
It's this fucking...

2100
01:06:19,090 --> 01:06:20,230
It's this idiot.

2101
01:06:21,110 --> 01:06:23,370
If we show as the bot game show...

2102
01:06:23,370 --> 01:06:24,170
Wait, these are...

2103
01:06:24,170 --> 01:06:24,450
It's...

2104
01:06:24,450 --> 01:06:24,610
It's...

2105
01:06:24,610 --> 01:06:26,770
These guys play Valorant so much.

2106
01:06:27,530 --> 01:06:28,910
I'm gonna go pee, be right back.

2107
01:06:29,170 --> 01:06:31,670
Wait, we're playing against actual Valorant players.

2108
01:06:32,770 --> 01:06:34,010
Are you guys all joining?

2109
01:06:35,130 --> 01:06:35,770
Yeah, man.

2110
01:06:35,890 --> 01:06:36,010
Maybe.

2111
01:06:36,050 --> 01:06:36,330
Yeah.

2112
01:06:36,730 --> 01:06:37,310
All right.

2113
01:06:37,350 --> 01:06:37,830
No technical issues.

2114
01:06:37,830 --> 01:06:38,410
If I feel like it.

2115
01:06:39,630 --> 01:06:43,010
We're missing two people cause they went to the bathroom.

2116
01:06:44,110 --> 01:06:44,590
Okay.

2117
01:06:44,950 --> 01:06:45,430
So...

2118
01:06:45,430 --> 01:06:45,590
I'm gonna go pee.

2119
01:06:45,610 --> 01:06:45,630
Okay.

2120
01:06:45,630 --> 01:06:48,990
So, for you guys, you guys get to pick via coin flip, heads or tails.

2121
01:06:49,890 --> 01:06:51,010
The captain's not here.

2122
01:06:51,290 --> 01:06:52,450
The captain's always heads.

2123
01:06:52,790 --> 01:06:53,250
Heads.

2124
01:06:53,250 --> 01:06:53,350
Heads.

2125
01:06:53,350 --> 01:06:54,050
But I choose heads.

2126
01:06:56,370 --> 01:06:56,830
Heads.

2127
01:06:56,970 --> 01:06:58,070
You guys picked heads.

2128
01:06:58,170 --> 01:06:59,370
Give me one quick second.

2129
01:07:06,690 --> 01:07:08,610
You guys have lost, sadly.

2130
01:07:09,050 --> 01:07:09,510
No.

2131
01:07:09,650 --> 01:07:10,530
We lost again.

2132
01:07:12,190 --> 01:07:12,830
It's okay.

2133
01:07:12,850 --> 01:07:13,870
We're used to it.

2134
01:07:13,950 --> 01:07:14,150
Yeah.

2135
01:07:14,150 --> 01:07:15,210
We're used to it now.

2136
01:07:16,650 --> 01:07:20,890
Let me get the other team's pick and then I'll relay the information to you guys on defense or defense.

2137
01:07:20,890 --> 01:07:20,990
We're gonna get their attack.

2138
01:07:21,190 --> 01:07:21,310
All right?

2139
01:07:21,570 --> 01:07:22,030
Hey.

2140
01:07:24,190 --> 01:07:24,650
Guys.

2141
01:07:25,090 --> 01:07:26,190
They're gonna pick defense.

2142
01:07:27,130 --> 01:07:27,590
Guys.

2143
01:07:27,590 --> 01:07:27,970
I don't...

2144
01:07:27,970 --> 01:07:28,590
I'm not...

2145
01:07:28,590 --> 01:07:30,250
I'm not as confident anymore.

2146
01:07:33,050 --> 01:07:35,230
At this point just have fun at the same time.

2147
01:07:37,510 --> 01:07:39,490
You guys sound like doomers right now.

2148
01:07:40,850 --> 01:07:41,730
Says you.

2149
01:07:41,890 --> 01:07:42,690
Like hello.

2150
01:07:43,270 --> 01:07:44,490
What do you mean says me?

2151
01:07:44,630 --> 01:07:45,070
I'm telling.

2152
01:07:45,070 --> 01:07:46,950
Your just tone of voice is always a doomer.

2153
01:07:47,370 --> 01:07:47,830
Hey.

2154
01:07:48,250 --> 01:07:49,350
That's just how the voice...

2155
01:07:49,350 --> 01:07:49,990
You guys are defending.

2156
01:07:49,990 --> 01:07:52,210
So make sure you guys are playing on Team B, alright?

2157
01:07:52,490 --> 01:07:53,870
Yeah, we're Team B!

2158
01:07:54,210 --> 01:07:54,650
Yay!

2159
01:07:55,090 --> 01:07:55,450
Let's go!

2160
01:07:56,130 --> 01:07:57,630
These guys are gonna attack us?

2161
01:07:58,030 --> 01:08:00,210
Yeah, these guys are gonna fuck us up!

2162
01:08:01,570 --> 01:08:02,910
Dude, it's over.

2163
01:08:03,130 --> 01:08:05,230
You're gonna get fucked in the ass real badly, okay?

2164
01:08:05,310 --> 01:08:06,070
Like, real fucking badly.

2165
01:08:06,070 --> 01:08:08,870
Even the admin doesn't believe in us!

2166
01:08:09,990 --> 01:08:11,630
Like, this is so fucked!

2167
01:08:12,670 --> 01:08:13,930
Woah, woah, woah!

2168
01:08:13,930 --> 01:08:16,570
They are just reaffirming what you're saying!

2169
01:08:17,710 --> 01:08:20,010
If we lose, it's your fault!

2170
01:08:20,290 --> 01:08:24,150
Even the admin doesn't believe in us!

2171
01:08:24,570 --> 01:08:26,330
I believe in you guys, okay?

2172
01:08:26,470 --> 01:08:27,590
Thank you, admin.

2173
01:08:27,850 --> 01:08:28,850
I don't trust you.

2174
01:08:28,990 --> 01:08:30,510
Guys, nades, nades, nades!

2175
01:08:30,610 --> 01:08:32,070
Oh, nades, nades, nades!

2176
01:08:32,770 --> 01:08:33,830
Who do I play?

2177
01:08:34,590 --> 01:08:37,370
Play this guy that goes boom with the DMR.

2178
01:08:38,370 --> 01:08:39,490
Oh, man...

2179
01:08:39,490 --> 01:08:41,310
What do you mean, oh, man?

2180
01:08:43,170 --> 01:08:44,770
I mean, play someone else there.

2181
01:08:46,570 --> 01:08:47,430
You wanna play?

2182
01:08:47,710 --> 01:08:48,390
Let's play!

2183
01:08:50,550 --> 01:08:52,770
Wait, did you find out how to TP?

2184
01:08:54,270 --> 01:08:54,690
Yeah.

2185
01:08:55,090 --> 01:08:55,930
Okay, nice.

2186
01:08:59,090 --> 01:09:00,610
This is a dust tomb, Matt.

2187
01:09:01,850 --> 01:09:03,370
This team is the most content defensive.

2188
01:09:03,530 --> 01:09:05,850
There's actually King's Row in this game.

2189
01:09:06,070 --> 01:09:07,090
Wait, there's King's Row?

2190
01:09:07,970 --> 01:09:09,470
All I'm saying... okay, listen.

2191
01:09:09,510 --> 01:09:13,910
All I'm saying, if this game mode for the tournament was escort, we would be winning by a mile, right, guys?

2192
01:09:14,270 --> 01:09:14,690
True.

2193
01:09:15,750 --> 01:09:16,170
True.

2194
01:09:16,570 --> 01:09:19,170
They would actually be getting shit on.

2195
01:09:19,330 --> 01:09:19,810
No cap.

2196
01:09:20,070 --> 01:09:21,250
What map is this?

2197
01:09:21,550 --> 01:09:22,330
Oh, I remember this.

2198
01:09:22,470 --> 01:09:23,330
Yeah, I put...

2199
01:09:23,330 --> 01:09:24,210
Yeah, this is dust.

2200
01:09:24,310 --> 01:09:25,010
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2201
01:09:25,230 --> 01:09:26,250
Like, legit dust.

2202
01:09:26,870 --> 01:09:27,730
Wait, we're on dust?

2203
01:09:27,770 --> 01:09:29,110
How do we... how do we...

2204
01:09:29,110 --> 01:09:30,830
Wait, everyone knows the callout's on dust?

2205
01:09:31,210 --> 01:09:31,990
Yeah, I know.

2206
01:09:32,170 --> 01:09:32,650

From up here, sure, Vor.

2211
01:09:39,970 --> 01:09:40,870
Wait, I should...

2212
01:09:40,870 --> 01:09:42,270
So, we should hold mid.

2213
01:09:42,370 --> 01:09:42,950
Okay, I'll...

2214
01:09:42,950 --> 01:09:44,930
I guess slow down to complete.

2215
01:09:45,290 --> 01:09:45,710
I'll hold mid.

2216
01:09:45,710 --> 01:09:46,070
I'm scared.

2217
01:09:46,070 --> 01:09:46,390
I'll hold mid.

2218
01:09:46,410 --> 01:09:46,550
I'm scared.

2219
01:09:47,350 --> 01:09:48,890
I don't know how this map works, bro.

2220
01:09:48,990 --> 01:09:49,030

It's dust, bro!

2222
01:09:50,950 --> 01:09:51,670

2223
01:09:51,790 --> 01:09:52,590
Use your nades!

2224
01:09:52,670 --> 01:09:53,450

01:09:53,590 --> 01:09:54,310
They're top as well.

2226
01:09:54,390 --> 01:09:55,210
They can drop down on us.

2227
01:09:55,210 --> 01:09:55,710
On Highground.

2228
01:09:56,310 --> 01:09:58,090

01:13:17,870 --> 01:13:18,590
We don't have hope for them.

2284
01:13:18,670 --> 01:13:20,710
We don't have hope for us.

2285
01:13:21,090 --> 01:13:21,810
Look at bottom mid.

2286
01:13:23,210 --> 01:13:24,370

2287
01:13:25,270 --> 01:13:25,810

Yeah, they're all top.

2291
01:13:29,410 --> 01:13:30,410
They're all high ground mid.

2292
01:13:30,510 --> 01:13:31,270
They're not bottom mid.

2293
01:13:31,370 --> 01:13:31,790
Top mid.

2294
01:13:31,850 --> 01:13:32,130

2295
01:13:32,150 --> 01:13:32,670
Top mid.

2296
01:13:32,710 --> 01:13:33,050
All of them.

2297
01:13:33,110 --> 01:13:33,870
They're gonna come...

2298
01:13:34,330 --> 01:13:34,830
Up mid.

2299
01:13:35,590 --> 01:13:36,470

2300
01:13:36,550 --> 01:13:36,950

He's above me.

2304
01:13:42,090 --> 01:13:42,390
He's above me.

2305
01:13:42,390 --> 01:13:42,910
I think they're going A.

2306
01:13:43,230 --> 01:13:43,930
He's above me.

2307
01:13:43,990 --> 01:13:44,350
He's above me.

2308
01:13:46,430 --> 01:13:47,730
I don't know what he's coming for.

2309
01:13:47,850 --> 01:13:48,810
What the fuck is above you?

2310
01:13:50,510 --> 01:13:51,230
Mid, mid, mid.

2311
01:13:51,270 --> 01:13:51,970
Are they on B?

2312
01:13:51,970 --> 01:13:52,890
They're rotating B.

2313
01:13:52,970 --> 01:13:53,570
Rotating B.

2314
01:13:53,610 --> 01:13:54,010
They're rotating.

2315
01:13:54,130 --> 01:13:54,530
They're all rotating.

2316
01:13:54,530 --> 01:13:55,090
No, that angle is crazy.

2317
01:13:55,230 --> 01:13:56,270
That's a cheating angle.

2318
01:13:56,770 --> 01:13:57,870
They're chasing me down mid.

2319
01:13:57,930 --> 01:13:59,850
They're looking at me mid as well.

2320
01:13:59,970 --> 01:14:00,470
Oh god.

2321
01:14:00,970 --> 01:14:01,930
They're actually getting B.

2322
01:14:03,790 --> 01:14:04,190
Okay.

2323
01:14:05,830 --> 01:14:06,370
Hi.

2324
01:14:07,170 --> 01:14:08,290
They traded me.

2325
01:14:09,890 --> 01:14:12,650
He's already, my ass.

2326
01:14:12,990 --> 01:14:13,770
Oh, I quit.

2327
01:14:16,130 --> 01:14:17,170
We got one.

2328
01:14:18,790 --> 01:14:19,330
Guys...

2329
01:14:19,330 --> 01:14:21,430
Guys, we're getting a little better, right?

2330
01:14:21,450 --> 01:14:21,910
Guys?

2331
01:14:21,970 --> 01:14:23,110
Are we getting a little better?

2332
01:14:23,510 --> 01:14:25,050
You're supposed to move them.

2333
01:14:25,070 --> 01:14:26,930
I feel like this is Attax-sided, guys.

2334
01:14:27,550 --> 01:14:29,250
That's what you said the last game.

2335
01:14:29,950 --> 01:14:32,010
This one is definitely Attax-sided.

2336
01:14:32,250 --> 01:14:32,950
Guys, guys.

2337
01:14:33,010 --> 01:14:34,310
How about we push this?

2338
01:14:34,310 --> 01:14:35,610
Push them somewhere as a fight.

2339
01:14:37,270 --> 01:14:38,170
Let's push B.

2340
01:14:38,850 --> 01:14:40,130
Are we gonna push B?

2341
01:14:40,150 --> 01:14:40,410
Okay.

2342
01:14:40,850 --> 01:14:42,630
I can't push us if we're pushing.

2343
01:14:43,170 --> 01:14:44,050
They scanned them.

2344
01:14:44,170 --> 01:14:45,190
They usually scan.

2345
01:14:45,390 --> 01:14:47,170
Why would they scan if they're pushing?

2346
01:14:47,470 --> 01:14:48,890
Yeah, they're not gonna...

2347
01:14:48,890 --> 01:14:49,750
Pussy shit.

2348
01:14:52,150 --> 01:14:53,230
Some pussy shit.

2349
01:14:54,250 --> 01:14:55,250
I'm throwing one deep.

2350
01:14:56,250 --> 01:14:57,930
Oh, they scanned it.

2351
01:14:58,130 --> 01:14:58,990
See, I told you.

2352
01:15:00,550 --> 01:15:01,710
They're waiting for me.

2353
01:15:03,270 --> 01:15:04,470
They keep scanning.

2354
01:15:05,470 --> 01:15:06,390
They might rotate.

2355
01:15:06,450 --> 01:15:07,350
They might rotate because of...

2356
01:15:07,350 --> 01:15:08,970
Yeah, because they know that we're all there now.

2357
01:15:09,270 --> 01:15:10,710
Yeah, they're valid players, dude.

2358
01:15:11,450 --> 01:15:12,510
They have intel.

2359
01:15:13,170 --> 01:15:14,310
I don't see anybody, man.

2360
01:15:15,150 --> 01:15:16,230
What a sick nade.

2361
01:15:16,770 --> 01:15:17,990
They're still waiting for next.

2362
01:15:18,410 --> 01:15:19,590
Oh, next!

2363
01:15:19,590 --> 01:15:20,890
You can kill him.

2364
01:15:21,750 --> 01:15:22,990
I'm gonna ult and kill him.

2365
01:15:24,430 --> 01:15:24,870
Okay.

2366
01:15:24,870 --> 01:15:25,770
I got his ass.

2367
01:15:26,010 --> 01:15:27,250
I thirsted.

2368
01:15:29,750 --> 01:15:30,830
I ulted as well.

2369
01:15:32,410 --> 01:15:33,710
Someone just went short for, I think.

2370
01:15:34,430 --> 01:15:35,650
Yeah, they were shooting my side.

2371
01:15:36,550 --> 01:15:37,790
Yeah, they ulted.

2372
01:15:37,970 --> 01:15:39,330
I see a blue ult there.

2373
01:15:40,570 --> 01:15:41,290
He's KO'd.

2374
01:15:41,490 --> 01:15:42,310
Wait, someone's top.

2375
01:15:43,350 --> 01:15:44,650
One of them is invisible, guys.

2376
01:15:44,650 --> 01:15:45,170
I got spotted.

2377
01:15:46,930 --> 01:15:49,530
How the fuck do they know?

2378
01:15:49,630 --> 01:15:50,090
Ghost me.

2379
01:15:51,830 --> 01:15:53,430
Fucking putting up my turret.

2380
01:15:54,130 --> 01:15:55,090
On my side, surefour.

2381
01:15:56,450 --> 01:15:57,150
Behind you, sure.

2382
01:16:00,590 --> 01:16:01,690
They can't shoot through the turret.

2383
01:16:01,710 --> 01:16:02,350
I'm cheating.

2384
01:16:02,710 --> 01:16:03,470
Oh no.

2385
01:16:04,750 --> 01:16:05,750
It's not fair.

2386
01:16:05,870 --> 01:16:06,930
They have a full auto gun.

2387
01:16:07,130 --> 01:16:08,810
Okay, you scared the shit out of me.

2388
01:16:08,910 --> 01:16:11,170
No full auto in close quarters.

2389
01:16:11,270 --> 01:16:11,590
He's solo.

2390
01:16:11,750 --> 01:16:12,270
I headshot him.

2391
01:16:13,290 --> 01:16:14,370
Oh no.

2392
01:16:14,450 --> 01:16:14,970
No!

2393
01:16:16,370 --> 01:16:18,330
No full auto inside the building.

2394
01:16:21,390 --> 01:16:23,050
No full auto inside the building.

2395
01:16:23,050 --> 01:16:24,390
We are fucked.

2396
01:16:24,690 --> 01:16:27,430
I thought you said no doomers.

2397
01:16:27,450 --> 01:16:28,690
I'm not dooming anymore.

2398
01:16:28,690 --> 01:16:31,090
This is attack side, guys.

2399
01:16:31,970 --> 01:16:33,710
I'm not dooming anymore.

2400
01:16:34,450 --> 01:16:35,690
You wanna know why we are fucked?

2401
01:16:36,650 --> 01:16:37,170
Why?

2402
01:16:37,230 --> 01:16:38,350
Because I'm top fragging.

2403
01:16:38,450 --> 01:16:39,170
That's bad.

2404
01:16:39,370 --> 01:16:39,850
True.

2405
01:16:41,030 --> 01:16:43,230
I have M.

2406
01:16:44,990 --> 01:16:47,450
RBR has 297 damage?

2407
01:16:48,450 --> 01:16:49,350
Yeah, he hasn't done shit.

2408
01:16:49,530 --> 01:16:49,610
That's ping.

2409
01:16:51,150 --> 01:16:52,070
297 ping.

2410
01:16:52,710 --> 01:16:55,430
And you also only have 297 damage.

2411
01:16:55,670 --> 01:16:58,230
Your damage is roleplay to ping right now.

2412
01:16:58,330 --> 01:16:58,450
I'm doing 300 ping, bro.

2413
01:16:58,690 --> 01:16:59,010
Oh.

2414
01:16:59,890 --> 01:17:01,010
Hey, learn to swing.

2415
01:17:01,150 --> 01:17:01,870
Use your ping advantage.

2416
01:17:02,310 --> 01:17:03,830
Yeah, where's your ping advantage?

2417
01:17:04,570 --> 01:17:05,950
I'm a professional swinger.

2418
01:17:06,910 --> 01:17:07,790
They're going A.

2419
01:17:08,690 --> 01:17:09,510
I'm heading A.

2420
01:17:09,690 --> 01:17:10,150
A, A, A.

2421
01:17:13,890 --> 01:17:14,770
I got them flying.

2422
01:17:14,890 --> 01:17:15,910
I got the tornadoes on them.

2423
01:17:17,790 --> 01:17:18,430
Are you okay?

2424
01:17:18,430 --> 01:17:18,910
I got one.

2425
01:17:19,790 --> 01:17:21,290
Okay, I'm looking at mid.

2426
01:17:21,330 --> 01:17:21,950
I'm looking at mid with you.

2427
01:17:23,170 --> 01:17:23,950
They fell back.

2428
01:17:24,390 --> 01:17:24,930
Oh, next!

2429
01:17:25,850 --> 01:17:27,170
They are gonna rez.

2430
01:17:29,310 --> 01:17:30,430
Oh, they're all gonna rush me.

2431
01:17:30,490 --> 01:17:31,410
They're gonna rush me so bad.

2432
01:17:32,150 --> 01:17:33,430
No, I fucking knew it.

2433
01:17:33,510 --> 01:17:36,190
I got time so hard.

2434
01:17:38,410 --> 01:17:39,330
They're top mid.

2435
01:17:39,510 --> 01:17:40,530
They don't have wallhack.

2436
01:17:40,770 --> 01:17:41,570
Bullshit ass game.

2437
01:17:41,870 --> 01:17:45,110
I don't really have a gun.

2438
01:17:45,410 --> 01:17:47,370
When they rush me with an auto gun, it's Joe.

2439
01:17:50,170 --> 01:17:50,650
It's okay.

2440
01:17:50,790 --> 01:17:51,830
I'm watching sure for it.

2441
01:17:51,830 --> 01:17:52,450
Not frag out.

2442
01:17:52,670 --> 01:17:53,670
Oh my god.

2443
01:17:54,310 --> 01:17:57,470
He has the better fucking DMR.

2444
01:17:57,810 --> 01:17:58,670
He has the better fucking DMR.

2445
01:17:58,690 --> 01:18:00,970
I think this emote thing on my body has like...

2446
01:18:01,850 --> 01:18:02,890
Press tab!

2447
01:18:03,010 --> 01:18:03,570
Look at my ping!

2448
01:18:04,350 --> 01:18:06,470
I think he's like, hard carrying.

2449
01:18:06,930 --> 01:18:06,950
I think he's like, hard carrying.

2450
01:18:06,950 --> 01:18:09,970
I think he's like, hard carrying.

2451
01:18:09,970 --> 01:18:10,410
Fucking nerd.

2452
01:18:12,530 --> 01:18:13,330
It's not fair.

2453
01:18:13,450 --> 01:18:14,370
He plays with Shroud.

2454
01:18:14,570 --> 01:18:15,790
He knows how to do this.

2455
01:18:20,370 --> 01:18:21,650
There's no way!

2456
01:18:24,730 --> 01:18:25,250
No.

2457
01:18:26,110 --> 01:18:27,730
This game is so fucked.

2458
01:18:33,550 --> 01:18:33,950
Oh!

2459
01:18:33,950 --> 01:18:34,610
Attack is just easier.

2460
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:35,290
Trust me, guys.

2461
01:18:35,430 --> 01:18:35,890
Oh my god.

2462
01:18:35,890 --> 01:18:37,050
There's a nade up there already.

2463
01:18:37,230 --> 01:18:37,810
What the fuck?

2464
01:18:38,850 --> 01:18:39,670
Trust me, guys.

2465
01:18:39,750 --> 01:18:40,390
I went to school.

2466
01:18:42,350 --> 01:18:43,150
Oh, bbbbb.

2467
01:18:43,190 --> 01:18:43,950
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2468
01:18:47,490 --> 01:18:49,350
Guys, don't be afraid to pull back.

2469
01:18:49,590 --> 01:18:51,950
Oh, I got exposed tracks on there.

2470
01:18:52,770 --> 01:18:54,210
Yeah, we're pulling back already.

2471
01:18:55,190 --> 01:18:55,930
Oh shit.

2472
01:18:56,050 --> 01:18:57,470
I'm gonna look at mid just in case.

2473
01:18:57,730 --> 01:18:59,810
They're pushing right side of the site.

2474
01:18:59,930 --> 01:19:00,130
Okay.

2475
01:19:02,090 --> 01:19:03,670
I can't like, I brain massaged!

2476
01:19:03,870 --> 01:19:04,470
I'm dead.

2477
01:19:04,570 --> 01:19:04,830
Res me.

2478
01:19:04,990 --> 01:19:06,810
Oh, I got wind granaded.

2479
01:19:07,750 --> 01:19:08,610
Oh, he's up here.

2480
01:19:08,750 --> 01:19:10,590
I'm coming for you over here.

2481
01:19:10,890 --> 01:19:11,870
I'm coming to your left.

2482
01:19:12,830 --> 01:19:13,810
I think they're gonna push.

2483
01:19:14,050 --> 01:19:15,070
I think they're feeling confident.

2484
01:19:15,350 --> 01:19:16,830
Yeah, I got knocked.

2485
01:19:16,830 --> 01:19:17,350
I got knocked.

2486
01:19:17,430 --> 01:19:17,710
One.

2487
01:19:18,450 --> 01:19:20,370
Two, they're behind.

2488
01:19:21,830 --> 01:19:23,130
Don't worry, I believe!

2489
01:19:24,110 --> 01:19:24,890
I believe!

2490
01:19:26,290 --> 01:19:27,150
Oh my god.

2491
01:19:27,730 --> 01:19:28,310
I never relied.

2492
01:19:28,830 --> 01:19:29,850
You got this.

2493
01:19:29,890 --> 01:19:30,210
You got this.

2494
01:19:30,930 --> 01:19:32,290
No, watch the audio.

2495
01:19:32,790 --> 01:19:33,950
Audio, audio, audio.

2496
01:19:34,310 --> 01:19:35,390
That's an audio issue.

2497
01:19:39,550 --> 01:19:40,910
I still believe in us.

2498
01:19:40,910 --> 01:19:41,790
Guys, come on, man.

2499
01:19:41,810 --> 01:19:43,430
We gotta lock B down, man.

2500
01:19:44,770 --> 01:19:47,630
Bro, our B is not great.

2501
01:19:47,750 --> 01:19:49,270
Our B is not good.

2502
01:19:50,590 --> 01:19:52,490
None of our shit is good.

2503
01:19:52,570 --> 01:19:57,570
Wait, does that mean we're gonna fight the team that they won against?

2504
01:19:57,690 --> 01:20:00,830
Because that team almost won against them too.

2505
01:20:01,150 --> 01:20:01,410
So...

2506
01:20:03,590 --> 01:20:05,010
Can we not talk?

2507
01:20:08,470 --> 01:20:11,130
I feel like they placed us in the wrong bracket.

2508
01:20:11,550 --> 01:20:13,570
I feel like they placed us in the wrong bracket.

2509
01:20:13,570 --> 01:20:15,270
We should now be in this bracket.

2510
01:20:16,230 --> 01:20:17,570
Yeah, they thought too high of us.

2511
01:20:17,710 --> 01:20:20,950
There's like another bracket where there's no Valorant players.

2512
01:20:20,970 --> 01:20:21,470
There's osu!

2513
01:20:21,590 --> 01:20:21,870
players.

2514
01:20:21,870 --> 01:20:22,950
It's A!

2515
01:20:23,350 --> 01:20:24,610
Shiver's gonna die again!

2516
01:20:25,430 --> 01:20:25,950
Wow!

2517
01:20:26,510 --> 01:20:29,690
They did the most stupid fucking knife imaginable.

2518
01:20:30,610 --> 01:20:32,890
All I'm saying is that...

2519
01:20:32,890 --> 01:20:35,470
No, that is the first time I pushed that angle.

2520
01:20:37,730 --> 01:20:38,930
Wait, what is mid?

2521
01:20:40,650 --> 01:20:42,510
How did he come from mid?

2522
01:20:43,030 --> 01:20:43,550
Guys...

2523
01:20:43,550 --> 01:20:44,890
That KO knife is bullshit!

2524
01:20:46,830 --> 01:20:49,450
Nah, I'm telling you there seems to have been these guys...

2525
01:20:49,450 --> 01:20:51,230
You know I'm here because I peed.

2526
01:20:51,870 --> 01:20:52,930
Oh, he's looking at me.

2527
01:20:53,190 --> 01:20:54,430
Wait, are you guys okay?

2528
01:20:55,290 --> 01:20:57,350
Guys, I don't think you're okay.

2529
01:20:57,910 --> 01:20:59,370
Maybe I'll just save my gun.

2530
01:20:59,990 --> 01:21:00,730
Yeah, yeah.

2531
01:21:02,970 --> 01:21:03,930
Got my kill!

2532
01:21:08,770 --> 01:21:10,990
Yeah, now I'm top fragger!

2533
01:21:10,990 --> 01:21:11,310
Let's go!

2534
01:21:11,790 --> 01:21:12,830
Get shit on!

2535
01:21:12,950 --> 01:21:13,710
Get shit on!

2536
01:21:13,810 --> 01:21:14,250
Pussy!

2537
01:21:14,310 --> 01:21:15,090
Who that shit on?

2538
01:21:16,030 --> 01:21:16,470
ZK?

2539
01:21:16,750 --> 01:21:17,710
Who the fuck is ZK?

2540
01:21:17,850 --> 01:21:18,290
I don't know.

2541
01:21:18,330 --> 01:21:19,070
You got shit on.

2542
01:21:19,650 --> 01:21:21,290
Congratulations, you got your first kill.

2543
01:21:22,330 --> 01:21:24,590
That was my second kill, dumbass.

2544
01:21:24,670 --> 01:21:25,770
But I didn't get the finish.

2545
01:21:26,570 --> 01:21:28,130
That was my second kill.

2546
01:21:28,190 --> 01:21:28,930
I didn't get the finish.

2547
01:21:30,110 --> 01:21:31,910
I'm playing on 300 ping!

2548
01:21:32,150 --> 01:21:33,330
You should be carrying me!

2549
01:21:33,330 --> 01:21:34,630
That's your choice!

2550
01:21:34,850 --> 01:21:35,410
No!

2551
01:21:36,630 --> 01:21:37,570
This server is fucked!

2552
01:21:37,630 --> 01:21:38,750
My rules!

2553
01:21:41,130 --> 01:21:42,770
This server is fucked!

2554
01:21:43,930 --> 01:21:46,470
I let the team go up in real time.

2555
01:21:46,490 --> 01:21:47,970
You recorded this.

2556
01:21:48,030 --> 01:21:49,450
You recruited this team!

2557
01:21:50,510 --> 01:21:51,710
I made a mistake.

2558
01:21:51,710 --> 01:21:51,850
I made a mistake.

2559
01:21:53,870 --> 01:21:55,270
Well, we're having fun.

2560
01:21:55,350 --> 01:21:56,310
Yeah, we're having so much fun.

2561
01:21:57,010 --> 01:21:57,230
It's mid.

2562
01:21:57,370 --> 01:21:57,470
It's mid.

2563
01:21:57,790 --> 01:22:01,010
They're mid as well.

2564
01:22:01,250 --> 01:22:02,130
They saw me.

2565
01:22:02,190 --> 01:22:02,450
I'm dead.

2566
01:22:02,950 --> 01:22:04,410
I've been spotted as well.

2567
01:22:05,050 --> 01:22:05,930
There's so many!

2568
01:22:06,210 --> 01:22:09,390
I'm just getting lagged.

2569
01:22:09,390 --> 01:22:11,390
I just lagged out completely.

2570
01:22:11,430 --> 01:22:11,970
I'm with you.

2571
01:22:13,310 --> 01:22:14,810
Oh, he's on the walls.

2572
01:22:15,090 --> 01:22:16,090
He's climbing walls.

2573
01:22:17,390 --> 01:22:18,350
Behind me!

2574
01:22:18,550 --> 01:22:19,030
Behind!

2575
01:22:21,710 --> 01:22:22,030
Bottom mid!

2576
01:22:22,050 --> 01:22:22,970
Bottom mid in our spawn!

2577
01:22:23,210 --> 01:22:24,190
Bottom mid in our spawn!

2578
01:22:24,610 --> 01:22:25,630
Oh my god!

2579
01:22:25,970 --> 01:22:28,230
Wait, that guy shot by two angles?

2580
01:22:28,510 --> 01:22:29,070
What the fuck was that?

2581
01:22:29,410 --> 01:22:31,590
I just deleted so fast!

2582
01:22:32,010 --> 01:22:32,610
What the fuck?

2583
01:22:32,630 --> 01:22:33,150
He got res?

2584
01:22:33,490 --> 01:22:34,270
Yeah, that's it.

2585
01:22:36,050 --> 01:22:36,490
1v3.

2586
01:22:36,550 --> 01:22:37,230
1v2 is chasing.

2587
01:22:38,790 --> 01:22:41,810
Why is your server always in a situation where it's a 1v3?

2588
01:22:41,830 --> 01:22:42,710
I don't know.

2589
01:22:42,710 --> 01:22:44,850
Because I actually survive on my site.

2590
01:22:45,370 --> 01:22:47,330
Because he's playing B on Dust.

2591
01:22:47,590 --> 01:22:48,790
He's playing B on Dust.

2592
01:22:49,010 --> 01:22:50,170
Of course he's alone.

2593
01:22:53,270 --> 01:22:54,730
They built a wall!

2594
01:22:56,070 --> 01:22:57,770
They're trying to key me out!

2595
01:23:03,540 --> 01:23:05,210
You guys are getting 9-0.

2596
01:23:06,910 --> 01:23:10,010
They took your site without even using wall!

2597
01:23:11,690 --> 01:23:12,770
Nades, nades, guys.

2598
01:23:12,850 --> 01:23:13,610
Pick the right nades.

2599
01:23:14,130 --> 01:23:16,330
You guys are getting 9-0.

2600
01:23:16,330 --> 01:23:18,550
You guys are getting 9-0.

2601
01:23:18,550 --> 01:23:19,270
Whose fault is that?

2602
01:23:19,770 --> 01:23:20,990
The captain?

2603
01:23:21,650 --> 01:23:23,730
I was top fragger there.

2604
01:23:23,890 --> 01:23:25,930
Yeah, my bad for picking you guys.

2605
01:23:26,970 --> 01:23:27,910
Honestly, yeah.

2606
01:23:28,030 --> 01:23:29,130
You could have got any.

2607
01:23:30,650 --> 01:23:33,790
I could be preparing for my debut right now.

2608
01:23:34,710 --> 01:23:35,490
You guys...

2609
01:23:35,490 --> 01:23:36,090
You're preparing.

2610
01:23:36,230 --> 01:23:37,830
We're mentally preparing you right now.

2611
01:23:37,950 --> 01:23:38,570
Yeah, true.

2612
01:23:38,810 --> 01:23:39,870
You guys did good.

2613
01:23:39,990 --> 01:23:41,010
I give you a round of applause.

2614
01:23:42,030 --> 01:23:44,190
It's because our admin didn't believe in us.

2615
01:23:44,250 --> 01:23:45,070
So I went in with...

2616
01:23:45,070 --> 01:23:45,690
It's not over yet!

2617
01:23:46,250 --> 01:23:48,410
I went in with Doomer mentality.

2618
01:23:48,410 --> 01:23:50,770
Because my admin didn't believe in us.

2619
01:23:52,090 --> 01:23:54,330
You were Doomer from the start!

2620
01:23:54,590 --> 01:23:55,750
No, that's not true.

2621
01:23:55,970 --> 01:23:57,390
That was not true.

2622
01:23:57,910 --> 01:23:59,270
It's still winnable!

2623
01:23:59,750 --> 01:24:00,490
We could do overtime.

2624
01:24:00,810 --> 01:24:01,350
Can we get one point?

2625
01:24:01,730 --> 01:24:03,050
Let's get one point, guys.

2626
01:24:03,430 --> 01:24:05,730
I believe that you can win, okay?

2627
01:24:07,070 --> 01:24:08,610
I don't trust anything you say.

2628
01:24:08,890 --> 01:24:10,030
The comeback is real.

2629
01:24:10,570 --> 01:24:11,390
Right here.

2630
01:24:12,630 --> 01:24:14,570
Why can't we play against osu!

2631
01:24:14,690 --> 01:24:15,030
players?

2632
01:24:15,310 --> 01:24:16,710
Why can't we play against Valor players?

2633
01:24:16,710 --> 01:24:17,610
We can't play against osu!

2634
01:24:17,710 --> 01:24:18,030
players.

2635
01:24:18,410 --> 01:24:18,750
Did we?

2636
01:24:19,290 --> 01:24:20,210
Did we lose?

2637
01:24:20,550 --> 01:24:22,670
We lost against the current times team!

2638
01:24:23,470 --> 01:24:24,730
Yeah, do you need like a champion?

2639
01:24:25,250 --> 01:24:27,710
Yeah, but isn't a Valor player in that osu!

2640
01:24:27,830 --> 01:24:28,070
team?

2641
01:24:28,350 --> 01:24:29,630
Wait, this guy's just pushing me.

2642
01:24:30,170 --> 01:24:31,910
Don't shoot on!

2643
01:24:33,070 --> 01:24:33,590
Thirst him.

2644
01:24:33,710 --> 01:24:35,010
Just remember the thirst in.

2645
01:24:35,950 --> 01:24:37,130
I already did.

2646
01:24:37,350 --> 01:24:39,290
There's one bottom left of me.

2647
01:24:40,050 --> 01:24:41,410
I'm looking but I'm not seeing.

2648
01:24:41,690 --> 01:24:42,650
Oh, they're pushing me again.

2649
01:24:43,270 --> 01:24:47,010
Guys, you're all just sitting there!

2650
01:24:47,170 --> 01:24:47,770
They're pushing!

2651
01:24:48,810 --> 01:24:50,230
What did I just die to?

2652
01:24:50,470 --> 01:24:52,330
I got sniped!

2653
01:24:52,710 --> 01:24:54,210
Ethos you fucking nerd!

2654
01:24:54,310 --> 01:24:55,370
Oh I got flashed!

2655
01:24:55,470 --> 01:24:55,690
Goodbye!

2656
01:24:57,430 --> 01:24:59,950
This fucking nerd sniping in defense!

2657
01:25:01,070 --> 01:25:03,850
I mean, sure if I was sniping in defense...

2658
01:25:04,410 --> 01:25:06,010
Only on bot matches.

2659
01:25:06,610 --> 01:25:08,450
He was DMRing defense.

2660
01:25:08,710 --> 01:25:10,170
I'm looking at flanks right now.

2661
01:25:11,930 --> 01:25:13,730
Next has this, I'm watching you next.

2662
01:25:14,630 --> 01:25:16,530
I'm looking at flank right here.

2663
01:25:17,190 --> 01:25:18,290
Are we doing B?

2664
01:25:18,950 --> 01:25:19,730
Two in middle!

2665
01:25:20,470 --> 01:25:21,190
Okay I'm coming over.

2666
01:25:21,290 --> 01:25:21,830
Oh my god!

2667
01:25:23,930 --> 01:25:25,410
I don't know man.

2668
01:25:25,670 --> 01:25:26,030
One died.

2669
01:25:28,250 --> 01:25:31,570
It's like watching a bunch of chickens with their heads set up.

2670
01:25:31,910 --> 01:25:33,290
Shut the fuck up!

2671
01:25:34,630 --> 01:25:36,270
I can't play like that!

2672
01:25:36,630 --> 01:25:37,750
Use your Q!

2673
01:25:38,550 --> 01:25:40,590
I'm fucking using the panicking!

2674
01:25:42,750 --> 01:25:43,450
Kill her!

2675
01:25:43,770 --> 01:25:44,290
No!

2676
01:25:48,230 --> 01:25:49,530
That was close.

2677
01:25:50,310 --> 01:25:52,530
I'm flanking now because of you!

2678
01:25:52,710 --> 01:25:52,850
I'm flanking now because of you!

2679
01:25:54,230 --> 01:25:54,790
Kill her!

2680
01:25:54,790 --> 01:25:58,930
Now my character is sad because of you guys!

2681
01:25:58,970 --> 01:26:00,250
I got second fragger.

2682
01:26:00,270 --> 01:26:01,250
I got second.

2683
01:26:01,270 --> 01:26:01,790
You know what?

2684
01:26:02,170 --> 01:26:03,150
There's a pattern.

2685
01:26:03,230 --> 01:26:05,870
Surefour and I are always sharing like top and second.

2686
01:26:06,150 --> 01:26:06,610
I don't know.

2687
01:26:08,290 --> 01:26:10,130
Did anyone else break 2k?

2688
01:26:10,390 --> 01:26:11,850
Anyone else break 2k?

2689
01:26:12,050 --> 01:26:13,090
Didn't think so.

2690
01:26:13,750 --> 01:26:15,290
The fact that like...

2691
01:26:16,530 --> 01:26:23,830
The fact that I have 2000 damage when more than half the time they didn't even come to my site and I have to retake one before.

2692
01:26:24,610 --> 01:26:25,410
That's crazy.

2693
01:26:25,910 --> 01:26:26,630
That's crazy.

2694
01:26:27,550 --> 01:26:30,110
I mean I didn't even break 1k!

2695
01:26:31,150 --> 01:26:32,450
I'm playing with 300.

2696
01:26:33,070 --> 01:26:35,490
I have to listen to your voice the entire time.

2697
01:26:35,650 --> 01:26:38,230
I have my utility out more than like my gun.

2698
01:26:38,330 --> 01:26:38,910
And I'm third.

2699
01:26:39,110 --> 01:26:39,410
How?

2700
01:26:42,690 --> 01:26:46,290
I have a grenade launcher that shoots slows more than I might.

2701
01:26:46,370 --> 01:26:46,510
I have a grenade launcher that shoots slows more than I might.

2702
01:26:46,510 --> 01:26:47,350
Explain.

2703
01:26:47,450 --> 01:26:50,130
I was throwing nades the entire game!

2704
01:26:50,630 --> 01:26:51,990
So was IPN!

2705
01:26:52,730 --> 01:26:54,850
I was doing it right!

2706
01:26:55,430 --> 01:26:56,190
I understand.

2707
01:26:57,310 --> 01:27:00,090
Also I'm on 300 ping half of my damage doesn't register.

2708
01:27:02,850 --> 01:27:06,470
Oh now he's using ping as an excuse.

2709
01:27:06,730 --> 01:27:08,890
I said from the start I'm 300 ping.

2710
01:27:08,990 --> 01:27:09,550
Did you not hear me?

2711
01:27:11,770 --> 01:27:13,210
Last match I had 200.

2712
01:27:13,470 --> 01:27:14,170
That's playable.

2713
01:27:14,170 --> 01:27:15,890
300 is not playable.

2714
01:27:16,390 --> 01:27:17,450
Wait but you got...

2715
01:27:17,450 --> 01:27:20,770
Why did you get invited as a captain then knowing that you're gonna get 300 ping?

2716
01:27:22,050 --> 01:27:23,230
Oh wow that's still going.

2717
01:27:23,510 --> 01:27:26,810
I wasn't told that there's gonna be NA and JP only but...

2718
01:27:27,570 --> 01:27:30,450
Also I was told there's only gonna be new players in this tournament.

2719
01:27:30,590 --> 01:27:32,910
How do you straight up fucking lie to me?

2720
01:27:35,190 --> 01:27:36,590
Apex pro by the way.

2721
01:27:37,170 --> 01:27:37,650
Previously.

2722
01:27:42,330 --> 01:27:43,630
He's not helping us.

2723
01:27:43,730 --> 01:27:44,150
I'm just gonna go back to the game.

2724
01:27:45,730 --> 01:27:47,330
We got the third one for sure.

2725
01:27:47,650 --> 01:27:49,390
Yeah you know what?

2726
01:27:49,410 --> 01:27:52,950
Next is like our emotional support player right now.

2727
01:27:53,010 --> 01:27:53,570
He's here to...

2728
01:27:54,210 --> 01:27:55,190
I'm telling you.

2729
01:27:55,870 --> 01:27:57,570
Group A just isn't ours.

2730
01:27:57,730 --> 01:27:59,990
Group B however when we fight any of those guys...

2731
01:27:59,990 --> 01:28:00,830
It's due over.

2732
01:28:01,090 --> 01:28:02,630
Why are we in group A?

2733
01:28:03,010 --> 01:28:04,690
Why the fuck are we there?

2734
01:28:05,790 --> 01:28:08,710
If we win our last match can we still go through?

2735
01:28:09,690 --> 01:28:11,010
No this is round robin.

2736
01:28:11,090 --> 01:28:12,330
Second day we fight...

2737
01:28:13,070 --> 01:28:13,890
I'm not round robin.

2738
01:28:14,170 --> 01:28:16,790
One day this is like where we're figuring out our points.

2739
01:28:17,690 --> 01:28:19,550
So wait this doesn't matter?

2740
01:28:19,750 --> 01:28:20,410
This doesn't matter.

2741
01:28:20,930 --> 01:28:21,610
This doesn't matter.

2742
01:28:21,630 --> 01:28:22,410
You guys are playing for seeding.

2743
01:28:23,350 --> 01:28:24,870
Yeah we're playing for seeding.

2744
01:28:25,130 --> 01:28:27,830
But then we're throwing on purpose.

2745
01:28:28,150 --> 01:28:29,030
We're throwing on purpose.

2746
01:28:30,210 --> 01:28:32,150
No cause if we...

2747
01:28:32,150 --> 01:28:34,250
Cause then people in the better seedings...

2748
01:28:34,930 --> 01:28:37,090
Wouldn't the people in the better seedings fight us?

2749
01:28:38,430 --> 01:28:38,930
Wouldn't the people in the better seedings fight us?

2750
01:28:38,930 --> 01:28:39,430
Because they...

2751
01:28:39,430 --> 01:28:39,750
Yeah!

2752
01:28:41,210 --> 01:28:43,190
Why are you throwing on me?

2753
01:28:44,170 --> 01:28:45,150
We have to fight the B group!

2754
01:28:45,350 --> 01:28:46,630
We have to fight these guys again!

2755
01:28:46,830 --> 01:28:48,510
We gotta win one!

2756
01:28:48,770 --> 01:28:51,790
If we lock in the last round it's easy.

2757
01:28:52,390 --> 01:28:54,070
If we win at least one...

2758
01:28:54,070 --> 01:28:55,550
We get to fight somebody in group B.

2759
01:28:58,110 --> 01:28:58,830
Lock in!

2760
01:28:59,750 --> 01:29:00,670
Last match!

2761
01:29:00,870 --> 01:29:02,510
Last please.

2762
01:29:03,410 --> 01:29:05,810
I could be prepping my debut right now please.

2763
01:29:08,310 --> 01:29:10,010
You have 30 minutes I mean.

2764
01:29:10,710 --> 01:29:12,150
I mean yeah you could do it right now.

2765
01:29:12,150 --> 01:29:12,970
Yeah prep right now.

2766
01:29:13,030 --> 01:29:16,110
What do you mean I can't f***ing change my scenes right now?

2767
01:29:17,150 --> 01:29:18,210
Guys you should...

2768
01:29:18,210 --> 01:29:21,170
I'm not gonna debut on a Stranova tournament.

2769
01:29:21,830 --> 01:29:27,070
You should all watch Doki's debut because I voice acted in it.

2770
01:29:27,630 --> 01:29:29,790
Oh yeah he has voice lines in there.

2771
01:29:30,950 --> 01:29:31,690
I do.

2772
01:29:33,310 --> 01:29:34,650
Yeah no spoilers.

2773
01:29:34,950 --> 01:29:36,570
I'm a voice actor by the way.

2774
01:29:37,990 --> 01:29:38,510
Yeah.

2775
01:29:38,510 --> 01:29:40,650
Yeah he's not...

2776
01:29:40,650 --> 01:29:41,450
I don't think Nex cares.

2777
01:29:42,170 --> 01:29:44,910
I don't think he cares.

2778
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:51,800
The voice line I'm not gonna spoil but it's a really good one.

2779
01:29:51,940 --> 01:29:53,360
How long is our next game?

2780
01:29:53,440 --> 01:29:54,180
Is this 30 minutes again?

2781
01:29:55,320 --> 01:29:57,060
You have another 30 minute break.

2782
01:29:57,200 --> 01:29:59,620
Your next game starts at 3pm PST.

2783
01:29:59,820 --> 01:30:00,660
Okay but like...

2784
01:30:00,660 --> 01:30:03,540
Are they playing right now or are they almost done?

2785
01:30:04,720 --> 01:30:05,600
They are...

2786
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:07,220
They have yet to start this game.

2787
01:30:07,260 --> 01:30:08,700
They haven't even started!

2788
01:30:10,120 --> 01:30:11,220
It's because of guys.

2789
01:30:11,380 --> 01:30:12,400
What do you not understand?

2790
01:30:12,540 --> 01:30:13,480
They respected everybody.

2791
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:14,640
They respect everybody.

2792
01:30:15,520 --> 01:30:16,760
I do have to say this.

2793
01:30:16,820 --> 01:30:18,280
I have to announce this.

2794
01:30:18,440 --> 01:30:21,780
So as you guys probably know, we actually have a substitute player.

2795
01:30:21,880 --> 01:30:23,700
So our practice didn't really matter.

2796
01:30:23,960 --> 01:30:24,560
You know?

2797
01:30:25,360 --> 01:30:27,200
This is not the reason we are 5 man lineup.

2798
01:30:27,400 --> 01:30:29,740
Yeah our member was supposed to be Roppelgator.

2799
01:30:29,860 --> 01:30:31,520
Way better than Nex.

2800
01:30:31,660 --> 01:30:32,360
That overwatch.

2801
01:30:33,900 --> 01:30:34,760
Way better.

2802
01:30:35,020 --> 01:30:37,080
Wait we could have done worse then.

2803
01:30:37,820 --> 01:30:39,280
How could we do worse?

2804
01:30:39,300 --> 01:30:42,060
How on earth could we do worse?

2805
01:30:43,220 --> 01:30:45,140
How did we get 4 rounds?

2806
01:30:45,680 --> 01:30:46,820
That one game.

2807
01:30:47,220 --> 01:30:48,140
That's because...

2808
01:30:48,140 --> 01:30:48,800
I don't know.

2809
01:30:48,900 --> 01:30:50,900
We weren't tainted and looming at that point.

2810
01:30:50,900 --> 01:30:54,160
We were just like... we cared more.

2811
01:30:54,680 --> 01:30:55,740
And now...

2812
01:30:57,380 --> 01:30:57,900
Now...

2813
01:30:57,900 --> 01:30:58,940
I'm a consistent player.

2814
01:30:59,340 --> 01:31:00,040
Me too.

2815
01:31:00,180 --> 01:31:04,780
I play the same whether I'm tilted, sad, happy or mad.

2816
01:31:05,200 --> 01:31:06,560
I'm happy even though we're losing.

2817
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:08,100
I was still second fragger.

2818
01:31:08,320 --> 01:31:09,680
Similar to our first game.

2819
01:31:09,680 --> 01:31:10,860
I was second fragger.

2820
01:31:13,780 --> 01:31:14,260
No.

2821
01:31:14,440 --> 01:31:15,280
Yes I was.

2822
01:31:15,460 --> 01:31:17,280
I remember because I was happy about that.

2823
01:31:18,160 --> 01:31:19,500
It was like the one time.

2824
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:21,740
That was the only time I was happy during that game.

2825
01:31:22,140 --> 01:31:22,620
What?

2826
01:31:24,280 --> 01:31:27,820
You're counting stats from the game when we lost 0-9?

2827
01:31:28,700 --> 01:31:31,260
No I'm counting stats from my first game.

2828
01:31:31,780 --> 01:31:37,760
And so you can't judge me for counting stats on the 0-9 when Surefour was fucking yelling about being top fragger there.

2829
01:31:38,220 --> 01:31:39,460
Yeah he was yelling.

2830
01:31:39,680 --> 01:31:40,240
But no one cared.

2831
01:31:41,020 --> 01:31:43,780
You guys don't care about him but you care about me.

2832
01:31:43,880 --> 01:31:44,660
That's fucked up.

2833
01:31:45,400 --> 01:31:45,920
MVP.

2834
01:31:47,360 --> 01:31:50,440
You weren't even MVP in the first one Surefour.

2835
01:31:50,900 --> 01:31:51,500
Team MVP bro.

2836
01:31:51,500 --> 01:31:52,840
Yeah I was team MVP bro.

2837
01:31:53,060 --> 01:31:55,320
I was MVP on the first and second.

2838
01:31:57,240 --> 01:31:59,720
I should go in coverage and start flaming him.

2839
01:32:00,240 --> 01:32:01,100
Oh shit.

2840
01:32:01,340 --> 01:32:02,580
I thought you actually went.

2841
01:32:03,100 --> 01:32:03,620
Yeah.

2842
01:32:05,720 --> 01:32:10,720
He put a black little square over our name.

2843
01:32:11,560 --> 01:32:13,100
Oh because of our name?

2844
01:32:13,740 --> 01:32:14,700
Oh yeah.

2845
01:32:14,920 --> 01:32:16,180
Yeah by the way guys.

2846
01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:18,320
So our team name is Overwatch 2.

2847
01:32:18,480 --> 01:32:20,280
But legally they couldn't do that.

2848
01:32:20,540 --> 01:32:20,800
But...

2849
01:32:22,720 --> 01:32:24,540
Yeah so we're watch over now.

2850
01:32:24,880 --> 01:32:26,320
So they had to put a...

2851
01:32:26,320 --> 01:32:27,860
I mean they could have done...

2852
01:32:27,860 --> 01:32:29,740
They could have told us not to use that name.

2853
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:31,300
But then they committed to it.

2854
01:32:31,300 --> 01:32:33,500
And now they said legally they can't do that.

2855
01:32:33,980 --> 01:32:34,460
So...

2856
01:32:37,500 --> 01:32:38,380
So they have to like...

2857
01:32:38,380 --> 01:32:40,580
And I also want to point out that that was Doki's idea.

2858
01:32:40,780 --> 01:32:42,100
The illegal shit was Doki's idea.

2859
01:32:42,100 --> 01:32:44,100
Literally RPR was like hey can you give me a name.

2860
01:32:44,220 --> 01:32:46,960
You know RPR could have asked any other teammate for names.

2861
01:32:47,120 --> 01:32:50,480
Like he did not have to put my suggestion as a name.

2862
01:32:52,220 --> 01:32:54,460
I thought you were like intelligent or some shit.

2863
01:32:54,460 --> 01:32:54,700
My bad.

2864
01:32:58,160 --> 01:33:00,980
Anyway so yeah now our name is censored on the mainstream.

2865
01:33:01,640 --> 01:33:02,040
And you said you weren't doing pussy.

2866
01:33:02,040 --> 01:33:03,400
Yeah but then you could have been a pussy.

2867
01:33:03,460 --> 01:33:03,980
So I did it.

2868
01:33:04,040 --> 01:33:04,380
Yeah.

2869
01:33:04,400 --> 01:33:04,440
But then you could have been a pussy.

2870
01:33:04,460 --> 01:33:04,620
Yeah.

2871
01:33:04,620 --> 01:33:09,420
You should be careful with your words in the future I think.

2872
01:33:09,940 --> 01:33:11,600
Is that even me?

2873
01:33:13,500 --> 01:33:14,660
Don't use those words.

2874
01:33:15,120 --> 01:33:16,320
Because you know I will do it.

2875
01:33:16,480 --> 01:33:18,880
Guys I don't think I'm going to be invited to the next True Nova thing.

2876
01:33:19,140 --> 01:33:20,400
Guys I think I might be blacklisted.

2877
01:33:21,580 --> 01:33:22,560
What's a True Nova?

2878
01:33:23,340 --> 01:33:24,080
I mean...

2879
01:33:24,080 --> 01:33:24,980
It's True Nova.

2880
01:33:26,980 --> 01:33:30,480
Admin should make it sound like you won't.

2881
01:33:30,820 --> 01:33:31,660
You won't.

2882
01:33:31,760 --> 01:33:32,720
I mean...

2883
01:33:32,720 --> 01:33:33,900
No it's not.

2884
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:34,440
There is a...

2885
01:33:34,460 --> 01:33:37,480
There is stuff that's happening that I'll say.

2886
01:33:37,960 --> 01:33:38,120
There is stuff that's happening that I'll say.

2887
01:33:38,120 --> 01:33:38,500
Um...

2888
01:33:39,660 --> 01:33:42,480
Listen now Admin we're not inviting you Doki.

2889
01:33:42,840 --> 01:33:44,400
Wait what's happening?

2890
01:33:44,760 --> 01:33:45,240
Wait what's happening?

2891
01:33:46,020 --> 01:33:47,060
You don't get to hear.

2892
01:33:48,400 --> 01:33:51,500
Depending on your schedule I'd like to especially talk with you two.

2893
01:33:51,580 --> 01:33:51,720
Depending on your schedule I'd like to especially talk with you two.

2894
01:33:51,720 --> 01:33:52,500
RPR and Doki.

2895
01:33:53,260 --> 01:33:53,740
Fuck!

2896
01:33:55,080 --> 01:33:55,820
Why her?

2897
01:33:56,200 --> 01:33:56,680
What?

2898
01:33:56,840 --> 01:33:57,920
Am I in trouble?

2899
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:01,440
No I wouldn't say you're in trouble.

2900
01:34:01,560 --> 01:34:01,980
No I wouldn't say you're in trouble.

2901
01:34:01,980 --> 01:34:03,660
Are we going to the principal's office?

2902
01:34:08,540 --> 01:34:09,040
No.

2903
01:34:09,320 --> 01:34:09,820
No.

2904
01:34:09,820 --> 01:34:10,060
No.

2905
01:34:10,280 --> 01:34:11,820
She made me do it.

2906
01:34:12,300 --> 01:34:13,920
She made me do it.

2907
01:34:14,060 --> 01:34:15,540
He's literally the captain.

2908
01:34:15,700 --> 01:34:17,560
He should be responsible for the entire safety game.

2909
01:34:17,560 --> 01:34:18,560
She made me do it.

2910
01:34:18,940 --> 01:34:20,760
I will lick the M's.

2911
01:34:20,960 --> 01:34:22,720
That is the big thing though.

2912
01:34:22,780 --> 01:34:26,680
As the captain you gotta remember you're upholding the rest of your team.

2913
01:34:26,940 --> 01:34:27,860
No way.

2914
01:34:27,860 --> 01:34:28,740
That was your fault.

2915
01:34:28,780 --> 01:34:30,420
You should not have invited me.

2916
01:34:31,380 --> 01:34:31,880
No way.

2917
01:34:32,920 --> 01:34:34,060
Why am I...

2918
01:34:34,060 --> 01:34:35,400
Why is it just me?

2919
01:34:35,660 --> 01:34:36,740
Other people...

2920
01:34:36,740 --> 01:34:39,180
Surefer also was also in the...

2921
01:34:39,180 --> 01:34:39,780
What?

2922
01:34:40,940 --> 01:34:42,240
We were good.

2923
01:34:42,400 --> 01:34:42,900
We didn't do anything.

2924
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:44,340
You're not the only one.

2925
01:34:44,420 --> 01:34:50,580
We're pulling approximately about 8 to 12 other people.

2926
01:34:50,900 --> 01:34:51,140
We're pulling approximately about 8 to 12 other people.

2927
01:34:51,140 --> 01:34:52,360
What did we do?

2928
01:34:52,700 --> 01:34:53,420
What did we do?

2929
01:34:53,580 --> 01:34:54,900
It's nothing you did.

2930
01:34:55,460 --> 01:34:56,700
It's nothing you did.

2931
01:34:57,700 --> 01:35:00,580
It's just a separate project that is happening.

2932
01:35:00,580 --> 01:35:02,600
Oh we're getting sponsored!

2933
01:35:04,300 --> 01:35:05,320
No we're not.

2934
01:35:05,620 --> 01:35:06,680
No we're not.

2935
01:35:06,960 --> 01:35:07,040
No you're not.

2936
01:35:08,860 --> 01:35:10,280
We're playing a different project.

2937
01:35:10,280 --> 01:35:11,420
Let me put it in perspective.

2938
01:35:11,780 --> 01:35:15,640
We are broke as f**k for these projects.

2939
01:35:15,880 --> 01:35:16,340
Oh okay.

2940
01:35:18,320 --> 01:35:20,280
I gotta go somewhere later by the way.

2941
01:35:20,420 --> 01:35:22,360
So we're not in trouble.

2942
01:35:22,640 --> 01:35:23,240
We're not.

2943
01:35:24,120 --> 01:35:25,760
You are not in trouble.

2944
01:35:25,800 --> 01:35:27,100
You're in trouble Ducky.

2945
01:35:27,280 --> 01:35:28,060
I'm good.

2946
01:35:29,500 --> 01:35:30,100
RPR.

2947
01:35:30,580 --> 01:35:31,660
You represent the team.

2948
01:35:32,140 --> 01:35:33,240
You're in trouble!

2949
01:35:33,660 --> 01:35:34,800
I get sponsored!

2950
01:35:35,260 --> 01:35:39,320
Wait does that mean I can say whatever I want and RPR gets in trouble?

2951
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:39,620
Yeah.

2952
01:35:40,900 --> 01:35:41,380
Yippee!

2953
01:35:41,800 --> 01:35:43,480
I transfer leadership to Ducky Bird.

2954
01:35:43,540 --> 01:35:44,440
No no no no.

2955
01:35:45,320 --> 01:35:46,720
I don't accept it.

2956
01:35:46,800 --> 01:35:47,300
I don't consent.

2957
01:35:47,700 --> 01:35:50,860
So wait if we get last place people will say RPR got last?

2958
01:35:51,140 --> 01:35:51,400
Yeah.

2959
01:35:52,560 --> 01:35:53,840
Okay let's lose guys.

2960
01:35:56,080 --> 01:35:57,380
It won't be me.

2961
01:35:57,740 --> 01:35:58,220
MVP.

2962
01:35:59,540 --> 01:36:00,020
SVP.

2963
01:36:00,080 --> 01:36:00,560
SVP.

2964
01:36:01,240 --> 01:36:01,760
Yeah.

2965
01:36:02,520 --> 01:36:03,040
SVP.

2966
01:36:04,360 --> 01:36:05,340
2k damage.

2967
01:36:05,740 --> 01:36:07,180
This just sounds tragic.

2968
01:36:07,620 --> 01:36:08,900
At least.

2969
01:36:09,040 --> 01:36:09,980
You know what's sad?

2970
01:36:10,120 --> 01:36:11,740
The captain not breaking 1k.

2971
01:36:16,260 --> 01:36:20,600
I'm gonna hang my mouse next game and let you do all the work.

2972
01:36:22,120 --> 01:36:24,100
That's pretty much what you did last game.

2973
01:36:24,340 --> 01:36:25,280
That's all I'm saying.

2974
01:36:28,760 --> 01:36:30,140
I hate this team bro!

2975
01:36:30,480 --> 01:36:31,920
I hate this team!

2976
01:36:32,060 --> 01:36:33,380
Why do I even invite you guys?

2977
01:36:33,580 --> 01:36:35,220
You chose this team!

2978
01:36:37,300 --> 01:36:38,940
You know what's crazy chat?

2979
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:39,060
Never again!

2980
01:36:40,160 --> 01:36:41,640
I was first pick.

2981
01:36:41,860 --> 01:36:42,740
For the team.

2982
01:36:44,320 --> 01:36:47,060
That was the first person he asked.

2983
01:36:47,260 --> 01:36:48,360
To join this team.

2984
01:36:48,380 --> 01:36:49,260
Because you DM'd me.

2985
01:36:49,340 --> 01:36:51,340
Because you DM'd me and you were like...

2986
01:36:51,340 --> 01:36:53,460
You wanna play the chain game next to this.

2987
01:36:53,560 --> 01:36:55,260
By the way, you wanna join stream now?

2988
01:36:55,280 --> 01:36:58,420
Why did he immediately just turn him and that's on him?

2989
01:36:58,520 --> 01:36:59,980
I was literally first pick.

2990
01:37:00,920 --> 01:37:02,860
It's a knife or a knife type thing.

2991
01:37:06,520 --> 01:37:07,920
I made a mistake.

2992
01:37:08,600 --> 01:37:10,280
This is not a huge loss in judgment.

2993
01:37:10,280 --> 01:37:11,520
This is a fun tournament though, right?

2994
01:37:11,560 --> 01:37:13,100
Yeah, I'm having a lot of fun guys.

2995
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:15,940
When we're actually in the game...

2996
01:37:16,640 --> 01:37:18,760
At least I'm gonna start late.

2997
01:37:19,160 --> 01:37:20,040
In judgment.

2998
01:37:20,100 --> 01:37:20,700
We're on time!

2999
01:37:21,020 --> 01:37:21,820
I'm punctual!

3000
01:37:21,960 --> 01:37:23,840
Yeah, we were all punctual.

3001
01:37:24,860 --> 01:37:26,560
Honestly, I thought Dok2 was gonna be late.

3002
01:37:26,660 --> 01:37:29,280
I'll make sure the seating tonight, you guys don't get absolute train railed tomorrow.

3003
01:37:29,500 --> 01:37:30,120
You can do that?

3004
01:37:31,740 --> 01:37:32,780
No, maybe...

3005
01:37:32,780 --> 01:37:37,240
If you want us to stay in this tournament longer...

3006
01:37:37,240 --> 01:37:38,420
You should make sure we...

3007
01:37:38,420 --> 01:37:40,880
We should make sure our opponents are here.

3008
01:37:40,900 --> 01:37:41,980
Yo, what is this?

3009
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:42,960
A rigging the tournament?

3010
01:37:44,360 --> 01:37:45,400
Listen, Sherry.

3011
01:37:46,160 --> 01:37:47,640
You said you're broke, right?

3012
01:37:47,700 --> 01:37:48,660
You need the viewership.

3013
01:37:48,660 --> 01:37:49,760
Yeah, come on.

3014
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:52,820
You want the viewership?

3015
01:37:53,840 --> 01:37:56,820
Listen, we might not be the best team, but we bring in the content.

3016
01:37:56,940 --> 01:37:59,220
You wanna keep us in this tournament as long as you can.

3017
01:37:59,720 --> 01:38:00,240
Yeah.

3018
01:38:00,240 --> 01:38:00,840
Okay, I'm gonna...

3019
01:38:00,840 --> 01:38:06,700
I better check on my bank account statement tomorrow and it just randomly shows plus 5k.

3020
01:38:06,980 --> 01:38:07,500
And then I'll be like...

3021
01:38:07,500 --> 01:38:07,700
Dok2!

3022
01:38:08,460 --> 01:38:09,460
Why me?

3023
01:38:11,300 --> 01:38:13,180
All I'm saying is that...

3024
01:38:13,180 --> 01:38:15,500
All I'm saying is that...

3025
01:38:15,500 --> 01:38:18,360
I have the highest viewership for Shranova right now.

3026
01:38:18,560 --> 01:38:19,640
And if you wanna...

3027
01:38:19,640 --> 01:38:22,120
I can't stay in this tournament longer.

3028
01:38:22,120 --> 01:38:22,420
I can't.

3029
01:38:24,460 --> 01:38:25,640
What is this?

3030
01:38:26,180 --> 01:38:28,100
This is blackmail, by the way.

3031
01:38:28,100 --> 01:38:30,960
This is blackmail, but we are not afraid to use it.

3032
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:31,520
This is definitely blackmail.

3033
01:38:31,520 --> 01:38:33,140
But we are not afraid to use it.

3034
01:38:35,260 --> 01:38:37,440
We will blackmail Shranova.

3035
01:38:37,960 --> 01:38:38,640
We will blackmail Shranova.

3036
01:38:39,240 --> 01:38:40,760
It's not blackmail.

3037
01:38:40,800 --> 01:38:41,460
I'm saying...

3038
01:38:41,460 --> 01:38:44,380
If we somehow stay longer in the tournament...

3039
01:38:45,160 --> 01:38:46,100
Oh my god.

3040
01:38:46,180 --> 01:38:47,980
Tomorrow's YouTube clip is gonna be...

3041
01:38:47,980 --> 01:38:51,340
Team watch over blackmail Shranova.

3042
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:54,500
I already see the title, man.

3043
01:38:54,640 --> 01:38:55,060
I already see the title, man.

3044
01:38:56,380 --> 01:38:57,100
Hey guys.

3045
01:38:57,800 --> 01:38:58,680
Whatever happens...

3046
01:38:58,680 --> 01:39:00,720
I had a great time, guys.

3047
01:39:01,140 --> 01:39:02,460
We're not gonna cease in this test.

3048
01:39:03,340 --> 01:39:05,280
No, you're gonna get ceased in this test.

3049
01:39:05,360 --> 01:39:06,960
Because you let this happen as the team captain.

3050
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:07,440
You're the captain.

3051
01:39:07,680 --> 01:39:08,180
Yeah, exactly.

3052
01:39:08,180 --> 01:39:09,520
You started the blackmail.

3053
01:39:09,680 --> 01:39:11,960
I'm just gonna disperse the cease and desist award, you guys.

3054
01:39:11,960 --> 01:39:13,220
I built on what you said.

3055
01:39:14,980 --> 01:39:16,480
You started the idea.

3056
01:39:16,620 --> 01:39:17,840
You planted the seed.

3057
01:39:18,520 --> 01:39:19,780
You see what you did, Shranova?

3058
01:39:21,340 --> 01:39:22,040
You saw what I did.

3059
01:39:22,060 --> 01:39:22,760
Now hold up.

3060
01:39:22,780 --> 01:39:23,400
Wait a minute.

3061
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:24,020
Run that back.

3062
01:39:24,900 --> 01:39:26,620
You said I have responsibility.

3063
01:39:26,860 --> 01:39:28,680
Now they're stuck on this shit like it's true.

3064
01:39:28,820 --> 01:39:29,900
Because it is true.

3065
01:39:30,140 --> 01:39:31,460
And Admin said it.

3066
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:33,100
Admin's word is law.

3067
01:39:33,120 --> 01:39:34,420
I'm not responsible for your actions.

3068
01:39:34,520 --> 01:39:35,340
And you know this.

3069
01:39:37,420 --> 01:39:38,840
I will not be.

3070
01:39:39,700 --> 01:39:41,700
Guys, how many more minutes do we have left?

3071
01:39:42,860 --> 01:39:43,340
Plenty.

3072
01:39:44,080 --> 01:39:46,420
Only 10 minutes passed since we argued.

3073
01:39:46,680 --> 01:39:49,120
We argued for only 10 minutes.

3074
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:51,320
It's because we've done this.

3075
01:39:51,340 --> 01:39:52,080
Are you kidding me?

3076
01:39:52,120 --> 01:39:56,320
We've done this so many times already that we're kind of speedrunning now at this point.

3077
01:39:56,500 --> 01:39:59,240
We only argued for 10 minutes.

3078
01:40:01,080 --> 01:40:01,580
We only argued for 10 minutes.

3079
01:40:01,580 --> 01:40:03,480
Guys, what can we talk about for 20 minutes?

3080
01:40:03,800 --> 01:40:05,500
I'm gonna fucking play a ranked game.

3081
01:40:07,540 --> 01:40:09,700
We can't because of the ranked dispersity.

3082
01:40:10,100 --> 01:40:10,600
No!

3083
01:40:11,880 --> 01:40:13,780
Why didn't you guys do your placements?

3084
01:40:13,780 --> 01:40:15,840
Let's just play Overwatch and Shranova.

3085
01:40:16,060 --> 01:40:17,240
We can wear holo-threes.

3086
01:40:17,360 --> 01:40:18,220
Wait, wait, wait.

3087
01:40:18,220 --> 01:40:20,240
Why didn't you guys do your placements?

3088
01:40:20,960 --> 01:40:22,280
You do placements too.

3089
01:40:22,520 --> 01:40:23,180
Wait, wait, Shiri.

3090
01:40:23,260 --> 01:40:25,680
Tomorrow, are we ever gonna play the Escort?

3091
01:40:27,560 --> 01:40:31,260
We do not have Escort planned in this tournament.

3092
01:40:32,740 --> 01:40:34,880
That's our strong game mode, by the way.

3093
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:41,140
Because currently at this time and standing, Escort is very, very, very one-sided.

3094
01:40:41,580 --> 01:40:43,480
Yeah, it's heavily D-sided.

3095
01:40:43,740 --> 01:40:44,520
Yeah, well...

3096
01:40:44,520 --> 01:40:45,760
It's us-sided.

3097
01:40:45,760 --> 01:40:48,080
That's why they're not letting us play.

3098
01:40:48,280 --> 01:40:48,880
True.

3099
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:51,500
Alright, guys.

3100
01:40:51,540 --> 01:40:54,520
Let's play Escort right now to pass the time.

3101
01:40:54,660 --> 01:40:55,700
To at least feel something.

3102
01:40:56,260 --> 01:40:57,580
Feel like one win.

3103
01:40:58,540 --> 01:41:02,560
Wait, is the custom game called RPR's Room?

3104
01:41:03,680 --> 01:41:04,280
Wait, is the custom game called RPR's Room?

3105
01:41:04,280 --> 01:41:05,060
Yeah, RPR's Room.

3106
01:41:05,140 --> 01:41:08,760
They went into your room, RPR, and 9-0'd you.

3107
01:41:08,840 --> 01:41:09,980
In your own house.

3108
01:41:09,980 --> 01:41:11,940
In my room, they fucked us.

3109
01:41:13,060 --> 01:41:14,600
In your own house.

3110
01:41:16,340 --> 01:41:17,280
That's so sad.

3111
01:41:17,280 --> 01:41:19,760
No, but that's because everyone left, so the title changed to RPR's Room.

3112
01:41:20,480 --> 01:41:22,100
No, we... oh yeah, that's true.

3113
01:41:23,260 --> 01:41:24,280
Yeah, the custom...

3114
01:41:24,280 --> 01:41:26,280
All of them left our room.

3115
01:41:27,500 --> 01:41:28,620
I think it's the same time.

3116
01:41:28,800 --> 01:41:31,220
An hour later, actually.

3117
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:32,680
An hour later.

3118
01:41:32,760 --> 01:41:34,180
I'm gonna be so dead, man.

3119
01:41:34,260 --> 01:41:34,740
No way.

3120
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,200
It's okay, we'll get Roflgator to the...

3121
01:41:38,140 --> 01:41:39,020
Okay, well...

3122
01:41:40,300 --> 01:41:41,780
Late arrivals will be penalized.

3123
01:41:42,380 --> 01:41:43,220
Where are the penalties?

3124
01:41:43,780 --> 01:41:44,980
I said that too!

3125
01:41:47,560 --> 01:41:49,900
Exploiting bugs or glitches will be prohibited.

3126
01:41:50,220 --> 01:41:50,760
Exploiting bugs or glitches will be prohibited.

3127
01:41:50,760 --> 01:41:51,140
What did you say next?

3128
01:41:51,720 --> 01:41:52,760
Rob hasn't even...

3129
01:41:52,760 --> 01:41:57,920
And also, each team has 10 minutes after the said time to get into the lobby.

3130
01:41:59,040 --> 01:41:59,580
After the said time to get into the lobby.

3131
01:41:59,680 --> 01:42:05,820
So since the game starts at 00 and 30 respectively, So since the game starts at 00 and 30 respectively, you have up until 10 and 40 respectively.

3132
01:42:06,040 --> 01:42:08,060
Alright guys, see you in 30 minutes.

3133
01:42:08,240 --> 01:42:08,980
I have time.

3134
01:42:09,720 --> 01:42:10,820
Where are you going?

3135
01:42:12,380 --> 01:42:15,580
It's like the principal doesn't show up in 10 minutes.

3136
01:42:15,580 --> 01:42:16,320
You can leave.

3137
01:42:17,060 --> 01:42:21,420
You wanna start 10 minutes late and start at 310 and then delay Doki's...

3138
01:42:21,420 --> 01:42:24,300
Yeah, I'm leaving exactly at 330.

3139
01:42:24,480 --> 01:42:25,300
Oh my!

3140
01:42:25,420 --> 01:42:27,060
I'm just gonna leave the match.

3141
01:42:27,060 --> 01:42:28,140
Suddenly I fell over in my room.

3142
01:42:29,240 --> 01:42:30,440
And passed out.

3143
01:42:31,160 --> 01:42:32,200
For half an hour.

3144
01:42:32,580 --> 01:42:33,920
That means I have the power.

3145
01:42:34,880 --> 01:42:36,480
The power to hold us hostage?

3146
01:42:36,600 --> 01:42:39,580
I will leave regardless if you're holding us hostage.

3147
01:42:40,140 --> 01:42:43,420
I'll have you know, if someone wastes my time in League, I will hostage them.

3148
01:42:43,420 --> 01:42:47,620
If they feed their lane, I will hostage them.

3149
01:42:50,640 --> 01:42:51,960
Alright guys, come on.

3150
01:42:51,980 --> 01:42:53,320
Let's just play one escort guys.

3151
01:42:53,780 --> 01:42:54,680
Just anything.

3152
01:42:55,060 --> 01:42:55,460
Please.

3153
01:42:58,180 --> 01:42:58,800
Fine.

3154
01:42:59,040 --> 01:42:59,660
Yay!

3155
01:43:00,620 --> 01:43:01,360
I'm ready.

3156
01:43:01,600 --> 01:43:02,200
IP in.

3157
01:43:02,960 --> 01:43:04,380
I'm launching Among Us.

3158
01:43:05,800 --> 01:43:08,140
Who are you gonna play Among Us with?

3159
01:43:08,360 --> 01:43:08,720
What the fuck?

3160
01:43:09,150 --> 01:43:09,460
Himself.

3161
01:43:10,640 --> 01:43:11,940
He's his worst enemy.

3162
01:43:13,440 --> 01:43:13,940
He's got two personalities.

3163
01:43:16,620 --> 01:43:17,240
He's fucking it.

3164
01:43:17,240 --> 01:43:19,080
It's like playing Smolity Box Among Us.

3165
01:43:19,800 --> 01:43:21,440
Oh my gosh, just like...

3166
01:43:21,440 --> 01:43:22,280
One of you is a beast.

3167
01:43:23,940 --> 01:43:25,380
Alright, let's do this guys.

3168
01:43:25,560 --> 01:43:27,680
Let's win one game in our lives.

3169
01:43:27,840 --> 01:43:28,580
Surely we'll win.

3170
01:43:30,180 --> 01:43:31,120
Surely we'll win.

3171
01:43:31,820 --> 01:43:32,320
Surely.

3172
01:43:33,260 --> 01:43:34,980
Guys, I believe in us.

3173
01:43:35,080 --> 01:43:35,820
There's no way.

3174
01:43:42,680 --> 01:43:43,580
Alright guys.

3175
01:43:43,760 --> 01:43:46,180
Guys, this is gonna be the day we win a game.

3176
01:43:46,360 --> 01:43:46,860
...

3177
01:43:48,140 --> 01:43:48,320
No.

3178
01:43:49,540 --> 01:43:50,020
Yeah.

3179
01:43:50,680 --> 01:43:51,740
I need a map.

3180
01:43:52,320 --> 01:43:54,140
We're gonna win this game.

3181
01:43:57,490 --> 01:43:58,610
Believe in us.

3182
01:43:59,730 --> 01:44:00,750
We can't be...

3183
01:44:00,750 --> 01:44:01,470
This is Overwatch now.

3184
01:44:01,490 --> 01:44:02,510
Yeah, this is Overwatch.

3185
01:44:02,870 --> 01:44:03,790
We're Overwatch players.

3186
01:44:05,050 --> 01:44:06,570
Hey guys, we're against all bots.

3187
01:44:06,570 --> 01:44:09,830
Except for Ori and Nyx and Novarine.

3188
01:44:11,690 --> 01:44:12,990
There's no men in this game.

3189
01:44:13,470 --> 01:44:15,150
Wait, those are all bots, aren't they?

3190
01:44:15,290 --> 01:44:16,730
No, only two of them are not.

3191
01:44:16,910 --> 01:44:18,210
Two of them are real people, right?

3192
01:44:18,210 --> 01:44:19,530
What if they are?

3193
01:44:21,070 --> 01:44:21,590
What?

3194
01:44:21,830 --> 01:44:22,870
Let me ask them.

3195
01:44:23,190 --> 01:44:24,090
Are you real?

3196
01:44:24,250 --> 01:44:25,370
Yeah, type in team chat.

3197
01:44:25,610 --> 01:44:27,590
Or like game chat.

3198
01:44:28,370 --> 01:44:29,770
Oh hey, we're D-sided.

3199
01:44:31,190 --> 01:44:32,530
That means we're gonna win.

3200
01:44:33,170 --> 01:44:34,230
We're gonna win.

3201
01:44:34,770 --> 01:44:35,290
Yippee!

3202
01:44:35,750 --> 01:44:36,250
Yay!

3203
01:44:38,250 --> 01:44:39,870
I think there are...

3204
01:44:39,870 --> 01:44:41,350
There's no real people anymore.

3205
01:44:41,350 --> 01:44:42,030
It's King's Row!

3206
01:44:44,030 --> 01:44:44,910
No, it's not.

3207
01:44:45,730 --> 01:44:46,750
Yes, it is!

3208
01:44:46,750 --> 01:44:47,250
It is.

3209
01:44:47,810 --> 01:44:49,970
It's legally distinct King's Row, guys.

3210
01:44:50,970 --> 01:44:51,950
It's not King's Row.

3211
01:44:52,110 --> 01:44:54,290
It's Queen's Row!

3212
01:44:54,830 --> 01:44:55,370
It's Queen's Row!

3213
01:44:55,590 --> 01:44:56,210
Let's go!

3214
01:44:59,330 --> 01:45:00,910
Did you just die to a bot?

3215
01:45:01,130 --> 01:45:02,790
Yeah, they are aimbotting.

3216
01:45:02,810 --> 01:45:03,590
Do not peek them.

3217
01:45:05,110 --> 01:45:07,250
Wait, I can control my bear.

3218
01:45:07,470 --> 01:45:07,810
Yeah.

3219
01:45:08,090 --> 01:45:09,390
Yeah, it's like a solvador.

3220
01:45:09,810 --> 01:45:11,010
That's what they did to us, remember?

3221
01:45:11,010 --> 01:45:11,450
Yeah.

3222
01:45:11,890 --> 01:45:13,870
And then we literally just looked at them.

3223
01:45:16,210 --> 01:45:17,530
That guy is in the air, 1 HP.

3224
01:45:17,790 --> 01:45:18,910
Wait, that's broken.

3225
01:45:19,210 --> 01:45:19,290
He's gonna turret.

3226
01:45:20,450 --> 01:45:21,670
Oh, he turrets, he turrets.

3227
01:45:25,240 --> 01:45:25,680
Woo!

3228
01:45:26,140 --> 01:45:27,480
It's okay, I didn't die to a bot yet.

3229
01:45:27,600 --> 01:45:28,520
One is on the payload.

3230
01:45:28,720 --> 01:45:31,340
Oh, he's doing that dumb cringe shit.

3231
01:45:31,900 --> 01:45:32,740
Yeah, so does.

3232
01:45:32,980 --> 01:45:34,080
I hate that shit.

3233
01:45:34,860 --> 01:45:36,180
I wish Overwatch has it.

3234
01:45:39,200 --> 01:45:40,840
Only Overwatch has that.

3235
01:45:42,020 --> 01:45:42,460
She hates that shit.

3236
01:45:43,360 --> 01:45:44,320
I need healing!

3237
01:45:44,860 --> 01:45:45,380
Mercy!

3238
01:45:45,800 --> 01:45:46,900
We don't have mercy.

3239
01:45:47,200 --> 01:45:49,800
He has gotta live.

3240
01:45:50,580 --> 01:45:52,360
Anyone got a pocket mercy or what?

3241
01:45:53,060 --> 01:45:53,840
God, no.

3242
01:45:54,320 --> 01:45:55,920
We just want a frag now.

3243
01:45:56,800 --> 01:45:57,580
What is that?

3244
01:45:58,220 --> 01:45:59,200
We have grenades.

3245
01:45:59,400 --> 01:46:00,020
We have heal grenades.

3246
01:46:00,280 --> 01:46:00,780
Just use that.

3247
01:46:01,200 --> 01:46:02,380
Come to my heal grenade.

3248
01:46:02,680 --> 01:46:03,900
I don't have heal grenades.

3249
01:46:04,180 --> 01:46:05,340
Yeah, I picked it up.

3250
01:46:05,600 --> 01:46:07,040
They are shooting teddy bear.

3251
01:46:09,060 --> 01:46:11,100
No, not the teddy bear.

3252
01:46:12,480 --> 01:46:12,600
I'm just saying.

3253
01:46:13,420 --> 01:46:14,700
These bots ain't shit.

3254
01:46:15,380 --> 01:46:16,500
Cause they are bots.

3255
01:46:16,560 --> 01:46:17,700
They are level 1 bots.

3256
01:46:17,860 --> 01:46:18,360
What do you mean?

3257
01:46:19,640 --> 01:46:22,380
Except next die to one of them.

3258
01:46:23,280 --> 01:46:23,760
No.

3259
01:46:24,200 --> 01:46:25,580
Yeah, I saw you dying.

3260
01:46:26,240 --> 01:46:27,520
It was a team kill.

3261
01:46:27,720 --> 01:46:29,300
I just saw you die.

3262
01:46:31,480 --> 01:46:33,520
They are not smacked off for what?

3263
01:46:34,100 --> 01:46:35,620
You are in spawn.

3264
01:46:35,860 --> 01:46:37,440
You guys died to them too.

3265
01:46:37,860 --> 01:46:39,540
I jumped off the map.

3266
01:46:42,040 --> 01:46:43,800
They are going to cap the first point.

3267
01:46:43,980 --> 01:46:44,520
They are not.

3268
01:46:44,620 --> 01:46:45,280
I'm here.

3269
01:46:45,440 --> 01:46:45,920
I'm active.

3270
01:46:47,580 --> 01:46:48,720
Oh, what a nade.

3271
01:46:48,740 --> 01:46:51,960
That was a huge nade.

3272
01:46:51,960 --> 01:46:52,800
I'm going to throw a nade too.

3273
01:46:55,440 --> 01:46:56,600
I can't see.

3274
01:46:56,840 --> 01:46:58,400
There is a guy right up top.

3275
01:46:59,000 --> 01:46:59,900
I'm flashing him.

3276
01:47:00,460 --> 01:47:01,260
Watch out, Donkey.

3277
01:47:01,260 --> 01:47:01,440
No.

3278
01:47:03,240 --> 01:47:05,100
I didn't think you were flashing now.

3279
01:47:05,960 --> 01:47:06,400
Sorry.

3280
01:47:06,400 --> 01:47:07,460
Oh, shit.

3281
01:47:07,940 --> 01:47:08,960
I avenged you.

3282
01:47:09,380 --> 01:47:10,800
I blame the guy that flashed me.

3283
01:47:10,800 --> 01:47:11,400
Two more seconds.

3284
01:47:13,060 --> 01:47:13,940
I'm back in it.

3285
01:47:16,200 --> 01:47:16,960
Damn, next.

3286
01:47:17,700 --> 01:47:18,140
What?

3287
01:47:19,700 --> 01:47:21,960
Guys, we should have been playing this mode instead.

3288
01:47:22,720 --> 01:47:23,160
True.

3289
01:47:23,720 --> 01:47:24,420
To think.

3290
01:47:25,740 --> 01:47:29,500
RPR invited Apex and Overwatch players for a Valorant portion.

3291
01:47:29,940 --> 01:47:32,200
How was I supposed to know which game mode it was going to be?

3292
01:47:32,260 --> 01:47:32,780
Because it was...

3293
01:47:32,780 --> 01:47:33,920
It's like the rules.

3294
01:47:34,240 --> 01:47:34,880
What do you mean?

3295
01:47:36,740 --> 01:47:38,420
I can tell now you didn't.

3296
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:40,240
You didn't read the meter.

3297
01:47:40,460 --> 01:47:40,880
I did.

3298
01:47:40,960 --> 01:47:42,140
I knew it was going to be the Valorant.

3299
01:47:42,340 --> 01:47:44,220
I knew it was going to be the Valorant part.

3300
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:45,620
You're a nerd.

3301
01:47:47,920 --> 01:47:48,820
Only nerds read.

3302
01:47:50,820 --> 01:47:51,200
Yeah.

3303
01:47:51,460 --> 01:47:53,180
And nerds are winning.

3304
01:47:53,560 --> 01:47:54,640
The nerds are winning.

3305
01:47:57,600 --> 01:47:58,560
Wait, they're using nades.

3306
01:47:58,580 --> 01:47:59,140
They're real people.

3307
01:48:00,060 --> 01:48:00,860
Ow, ow, ow.

3308
01:48:01,060 --> 01:48:02,480
Wait, some of them are actually...

3309
01:48:02,480 --> 01:48:04,100
Oh, the bots can use nades?

3310
01:48:04,220 --> 01:48:04,720
Oh, okay.

3311
01:48:06,400 --> 01:48:06,900
They're the goats.

3312
01:48:07,660 --> 01:48:08,960
Yeah, they're aimbotters.

3313
01:48:14,090 --> 01:48:14,490
Alright.

3314
01:48:15,270 --> 01:48:16,170
We're doing it, guys.

3315
01:48:16,610 --> 01:48:17,410
They're going to cap.

3316
01:48:17,530 --> 01:48:18,190
We're not doing shit.

3317
01:48:18,970 --> 01:48:19,370
C9.

3318
01:48:20,890 --> 01:48:23,130
Even in this game, we C9.

3319
01:48:23,550 --> 01:48:24,330
Surefire, are you okay?

3320
01:48:24,430 --> 01:48:25,190
Does it bring PTSD?

3321
01:48:26,290 --> 01:48:26,930
I was dead.

3322
01:48:27,190 --> 01:48:28,350
Nothing I can do about it.

3323
01:48:30,770 --> 01:48:31,850
We're going to lose the bots.

3324
01:48:32,210 --> 01:48:32,890
No, we're not.

3325
01:48:32,970 --> 01:48:35,390
We're delaying this because we have fucking 10 more minutes.

3326
01:48:36,650 --> 01:48:37,650
Dude, look at me.

3327
01:48:37,650 --> 01:48:38,550
Look at where...

3328
01:48:38,550 --> 01:48:40,130
I'm moment king.

3329
01:48:44,720 --> 01:48:45,460
It's okay, guys.

3330
01:48:45,600 --> 01:48:46,260
On the point!

3331
01:48:46,380 --> 01:48:46,640
On the point!

3332
01:48:47,340 --> 01:48:48,060
She's aiming at me.

3333
01:48:49,220 --> 01:48:50,940
I mean, they're literally robots.

3334
01:48:51,080 --> 01:48:52,640
So, I'm going to fucking throw my turret.

3335
01:48:52,840 --> 01:48:53,440
Fuck this.

3336
01:48:53,500 --> 01:48:53,920
I don't care.

3337
01:48:57,940 --> 01:48:58,540
They're beating.

3338
01:49:00,340 --> 01:49:00,780
Yay!

3339
01:49:01,560 --> 01:49:02,660
I'm getting cooked!

3340
01:49:03,600 --> 01:49:04,040
Yay!

3341
01:49:04,420 --> 01:49:05,180
More tornadoes!

3342
01:49:06,720 --> 01:49:07,960
What's that shit in the sky?

3343
01:49:10,960 --> 01:49:12,140
He's just beaming in...

3344
01:49:12,140 --> 01:49:13,480
Did you nade flash me?

3345
01:49:14,740 --> 01:49:16,060
Did you fucking...

3346
01:49:17,260 --> 01:49:19,000
We're just spawn camping bots.

3347
01:49:24,910 --> 01:49:25,590
On you.

3348
01:49:26,610 --> 01:49:27,370
Oh, nice.

3349
01:49:27,410 --> 01:49:27,410
He's dead.

3350
01:49:27,410 --> 01:49:28,990
I'm so sure I'm going to die an embarrassing death.

3351
01:49:30,290 --> 01:49:30,770
Nice.

3352
01:49:32,410 --> 01:49:33,350
Next, I got you.

3353
01:49:33,430 --> 01:49:34,090
Fly high, bird.

3354
01:49:34,570 --> 01:49:35,670
I need some healing.

3355
01:49:35,950 --> 01:49:36,170
Oh!

3356
01:49:37,590 --> 01:49:40,390
Oh my god, the amount of headshots I just delivered.

3357
01:49:42,230 --> 01:49:43,090
Oh my god.

3358
01:49:43,350 --> 01:49:43,830
Whoa!

3359
01:49:44,730 --> 01:49:44,850
I'm the only one!

3360
01:49:48,330 --> 01:49:49,270
Oh, there's an 8.

3361
01:49:49,430 --> 01:49:49,530
Ow.

3362
01:49:49,730 --> 01:49:50,050
Fuck.

3363
01:49:52,370 --> 01:49:53,270
That's so funny.

3364
01:49:53,330 --> 01:49:53,730
Yay!

3365
01:49:56,510 --> 01:49:57,250
I'm in here.

3366
01:49:57,370 --> 01:49:58,390
Paper Marioing.

3367
01:49:58,510 --> 01:50:01,610
Up here, you're literally like in there.

3368
01:50:03,130 --> 01:50:03,890
You're welcome.

3369
01:50:03,990 --> 01:50:04,650
I saved your life.

3370
01:50:05,930 --> 01:50:07,550
That's what teammates do to each other.

3371
01:50:07,730 --> 01:50:08,970
Not... not you.

3372
01:50:10,190 --> 01:50:10,970
The fuck?

3373
01:50:12,270 --> 01:50:13,130
What are they?

3374
01:50:14,730 --> 01:50:15,310
I'm killing them in spawn.

3375
01:50:15,490 --> 01:50:16,350
What do you mean, where are they?

3376
01:50:16,410 --> 01:50:17,030
Where are they?

3377
01:50:17,610 --> 01:50:18,970
How do they see 9-us?

3378
01:50:19,250 --> 01:50:19,910
Shoot that guy!

3379
01:50:21,690 --> 01:50:22,650
I shot him.

3380
01:50:24,150 --> 01:50:25,030
I got ace.

3381
01:50:25,830 --> 01:50:26,750
This should have been...

3382
01:50:26,750 --> 01:50:27,750
This should have been our game.

3383
01:50:28,070 --> 01:50:29,670
This should have been our game mode.

3384
01:50:29,750 --> 01:50:30,850
They're pushing C payload!

3385
01:50:31,550 --> 01:50:33,570
How the fuck is she pushing the payload?

3386
01:50:33,770 --> 01:50:37,350
They're just going paper mode and like staying on it.

3387
01:50:37,430 --> 01:50:39,510
Yeah, they're just on paper mode and like fuck with us.

3388
01:50:39,590 --> 01:50:41,610
That's fucked up that they programmed that into the bot.

3389
01:50:41,990 --> 01:50:43,350
That's actually messed up.

3390
01:50:43,350 --> 01:50:44,990
That should not be a bot.

3391
01:50:45,410 --> 01:50:46,430
I'm a real player.

3392
01:50:46,690 --> 01:50:47,890
That should not be a program.

3393
01:50:48,450 --> 01:50:52,090
Now I'm pretty sure the bots are like AI based on like other players.

3394
01:50:52,630 --> 01:50:53,970
That's so messed up.

3395
01:50:54,010 --> 01:50:54,450
How did they spawn by the way?

3396
01:50:55,170 --> 01:50:55,650
What?

3397
01:50:57,150 --> 01:50:58,610
Like they learn from players.

3398
01:50:58,730 --> 01:51:01,470
They learn how to cheese from other players.

3399
01:51:02,430 --> 01:51:03,770
That's funny as fuck actually.

3400
01:51:04,030 --> 01:51:05,890
That's really good AI learning.

3401
01:51:05,990 --> 01:51:06,270
Does that mean that...

3402
01:51:07,230 --> 01:51:08,750
That's why they can see the payload.

3403
01:51:08,930 --> 01:51:09,870
They were learning from me.

3404
01:51:09,870 --> 01:51:12,190
Guys, I think they're pushing again.

3405
01:51:12,190 --> 01:51:12,370
Oh, it's C9 again.

3406
01:51:12,610 --> 01:51:14,110
Oh my fucking god.

3407
01:51:15,170 --> 01:51:17,370
How the fuck did we keep getting behind?

3408
01:51:17,750 --> 01:51:19,150
How do they do this?

3409
01:51:19,490 --> 01:51:21,170
I'm gonna put turrets on the guy.

3410
01:51:22,290 --> 01:51:22,990
I'm dead.

3411
01:51:23,310 --> 01:51:26,330
The AI just like no-clipped in there.

3412
01:51:27,130 --> 01:51:28,050
Yeah, they saw that.

3413
01:51:28,390 --> 01:51:30,570
They just teleport into the car.

3414
01:51:35,040 --> 01:51:37,060
I mean, Nadia, what the fuck?

3415
01:51:40,280 --> 01:51:41,880
Yeah, that guy is definitely AI.

3416
01:51:42,020 --> 01:51:42,660
There's no way.

3417
01:51:47,380 --> 01:51:48,580
Oh my god.

3418
01:51:48,620 --> 01:51:50,140
There's no way that guy was real.

3419
01:51:54,500 --> 01:51:56,840
He wants to flank again.

3420
01:51:57,300 --> 01:51:57,880
Peer!

3421
01:51:57,980 --> 01:52:01,400
That was scary.

3422
01:52:02,300 --> 01:52:02,920
Wow!

3423
01:52:03,200 --> 01:52:03,520
Goodbye.

3424
01:52:06,400 --> 01:52:07,020
Nice.

3425
01:52:08,800 --> 01:52:09,420
Nice.

3426
01:52:09,500 --> 01:52:10,440
Yeah, I'm killing bots.

3427
01:52:10,920 --> 01:52:11,420
Yeah!

3428
01:52:12,800 --> 01:52:13,880
Oh my god!

3429
01:52:17,100 --> 01:52:18,400
I have 200 ping now.

3430
01:52:18,620 --> 01:52:19,600
Oh my god!

3431
01:52:19,760 --> 01:52:20,560
Wait, you're right.

3432
01:52:20,780 --> 01:52:22,700
This is actually a better server for you.

3433
01:52:23,480 --> 01:52:24,300
I told you.

3434
01:52:24,440 --> 01:52:25,440
I'm getting griefed.

3435
01:52:25,440 --> 01:52:26,280
They're griefing me on purpose.

3436
01:52:26,680 --> 01:52:28,040
Just request a server.

3437
01:52:29,220 --> 01:52:30,460
It's only one server.

3438
01:52:30,540 --> 01:52:31,460
San Francisco...

3439
01:52:31,460 --> 01:52:33,140
Wait, is it actually only one server?

3440
01:52:33,340 --> 01:52:34,300
Yeah, it is.

3441
01:52:34,540 --> 01:52:36,240
Okay, that's pretty funny.

3442
01:52:38,500 --> 01:52:39,400
They're in the tunnel!

3443
01:52:39,740 --> 01:52:39,960
Oh!

3444
01:52:41,580 --> 01:52:44,400
They should give us the Asia servers.

3445
01:52:45,920 --> 01:52:46,400
Japan?

3446
01:52:46,760 --> 01:52:47,160
Yeah.

3447
01:52:47,160 --> 01:52:48,300
That's way better for me.

3448
01:52:48,420 --> 01:52:48,860
350?

3449
01:52:49,980 --> 01:52:50,420
Yeah.

3450
01:52:51,280 --> 01:52:53,540
I mean, it would equalize everybody else.

3451
01:52:54,860 --> 01:52:56,280
Yeah, I would be using it though.

3452
01:52:56,300 --> 01:52:56,540
Guys, C9.

3453
01:52:56,620 --> 01:52:57,060
C9.

3454
01:52:57,060 --> 01:52:57,700
C9, guys.

3455
01:52:57,820 --> 01:52:58,260
C9.

3456
01:52:58,580 --> 01:52:58,920
I got him.

3457
01:52:59,040 --> 01:52:59,240
I got him.

3458
01:52:59,320 --> 01:52:59,600
I got him.

3459
01:53:01,220 --> 01:53:03,960
Because we were getting C9 again, guys.

3460
01:53:06,680 --> 01:53:07,120
Yeah!

3461
01:53:07,320 --> 01:53:07,760
Wow.

3462
01:53:07,760 --> 01:53:10,600
Seven more minutes and we get to play.

3463
01:53:11,540 --> 01:53:12,420
Seven more...

3464
01:53:12,420 --> 01:53:12,720
Okay.

3465
01:53:14,140 --> 01:53:15,780
I mean, we won't too fast.

3466
01:53:15,940 --> 01:53:17,120
Like, we're just too good.

3467
01:53:19,960 --> 01:53:21,640
Okay, good IPN stole 11p, bro.

3468
01:53:24,400 --> 01:53:25,960
I healed more than you, though.

3469
01:53:26,040 --> 01:53:26,900
I healed the most.

3470
01:53:27,500 --> 01:53:28,580
How did I heal?

3471
01:53:28,840 --> 01:53:30,460
Apparently, they just started the game.

3472
01:53:31,340 --> 01:53:31,780
What?

3473
01:53:32,280 --> 01:53:33,300
No way, right?

3474
01:53:34,140 --> 01:53:35,840
Someone said they're just starting out.

3475
01:53:36,580 --> 01:53:38,680
Someone opened the stream right now and checked.

3476
01:53:39,120 --> 01:53:39,500
Someone...

3477
01:53:39,500 --> 01:53:41,360
Someone opened the stream right now and checked.

3478
01:53:41,440 --> 01:53:41,640
Someone...

3479
01:53:41,640 --> 01:53:42,700
Someone opened the stream right now and checked.

3480
01:53:42,720 --> 01:53:44,820
Someone opened the stream right now and checked.

3481
01:53:44,820 --> 01:53:46,260
I opened my own stream, my bad.

3482
01:53:49,280 --> 01:53:50,240
It's 2-7.

3483
01:53:50,640 --> 01:53:51,360
It's 2-7.

3484
01:53:51,360 --> 01:53:53,300
Whoever said that in your chat, they're lying.

3485
01:53:53,320 --> 01:53:53,960
I got one guy.

3486
01:53:54,420 --> 01:53:54,940
Liar!

3487
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:56,520
Liar!

3488
01:53:56,520 --> 01:53:56,920
Liar!

3489
01:53:58,700 --> 01:54:01,760
Yeah, my chat was lying.

3490
01:54:01,820 --> 01:54:02,700
My one guy.

3491
01:54:03,640 --> 01:54:04,500
Fucking liar.

3492
01:54:04,560 --> 01:54:07,180
Wait, are we playing the team that's winning or the team that's losing?

3493
01:54:08,380 --> 01:54:09,300
I don't know.

3494
01:54:09,540 --> 01:54:11,740
I don't know.

3495
01:54:14,240 --> 01:54:14,920
I don't know.

3496
01:54:15,040 --> 01:54:16,940
Knowing us, we're gonna play against the winners.

3497
01:54:19,080 --> 01:54:19,620
Knowing us, we're gonna play against the winners.

3498
01:54:19,620 --> 01:54:20,220
How's the turning going?

3499
01:54:20,280 --> 01:54:21,100
We're steamrolling.

3500
01:54:21,420 --> 01:54:21,920
Yeah.

3501
01:54:22,360 --> 01:54:23,920
In certain modes.

3502
01:54:24,980 --> 01:54:25,320
Yeah.

3503
01:54:25,340 --> 01:54:27,460
Yeah, against bots, there's no chance.

3504
01:54:27,740 --> 01:54:30,160
We literally cannot lose a round.

3505
01:54:30,620 --> 01:54:32,380
Technically, we broke our last streak.

3506
01:54:32,920 --> 01:54:33,120
Technically, we broke our last streak.

3507
01:54:33,490 --> 01:54:35,100
Yeah, we went 9-0 last game.

3508
01:54:35,320 --> 01:54:37,220
No, no, we won last game.

3509
01:54:37,320 --> 01:54:37,600
Remember?

3510
01:54:37,880 --> 01:54:38,500
We won.

3511
01:54:38,500 --> 01:54:40,380
Yeah, I said we went 9-0.

3512
01:54:42,580 --> 01:54:43,300
Alright, guys.

3513
01:54:43,300 --> 01:54:44,100
We're just waiting.

3514
01:54:44,340 --> 01:54:46,720
We're waiting at 7 more minutes to...

3515
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:48,440
We're waiting at 7 more minutes to...

3516
01:54:48,440 --> 01:54:49,380
Till our next game.

3517
01:54:49,600 --> 01:54:49,760
Till our next game.

3518
01:54:49,760 --> 01:54:52,740
Where we hopefully don't get 9-0'd.

3519
01:54:52,900 --> 01:54:53,040
It's 2-8.

3520
01:54:54,500 --> 01:54:55,780
Oh, it's almost time.

3521
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:56,880
They shouldn't have a break.

3522
01:54:57,280 --> 01:55:01,040
They should go straight into playing against us.

3523
01:55:02,060 --> 01:55:04,060
I put the Among Us lobby code in the lobby.

3524
01:55:04,280 --> 01:55:04,860
Alright, what?

3525
01:55:06,180 --> 01:55:08,480
Alright, should I put it for... Do you want to play against us?

3526
01:55:08,500 --> 01:55:09,260
Should we play against our viewers too?

3527
01:55:10,040 --> 01:55:10,600
Yeah.

3528
01:55:10,800 --> 01:55:11,940
Hey, viewers.

3529
01:55:12,040 --> 01:55:15,680
If you want to join Surefour, it's Among Us lobby.

3530
01:55:17,380 --> 01:55:18,620
It was green!

3531
01:55:18,820 --> 01:55:19,320
Green!

3532
01:55:20,500 --> 01:55:21,060
Green!

3533
01:55:21,760 --> 01:55:22,320
Green!

3534
01:55:22,380 --> 01:55:23,720
DC, I'm on ramp!

3535
01:55:27,020 --> 01:55:29,520
If you guys want to join...

3536
01:55:31,660 --> 01:55:33,500
Surefour will have people to play with.

3537
01:55:33,540 --> 01:55:33,880
Yeah, yeah.

3538
01:55:33,880 --> 01:55:35,460
He needs people to play with, guys.

3539
01:55:36,080 --> 01:55:37,300
Someone, please.

3540
01:55:38,500 --> 01:55:39,280
He's not even streaming.

3541
01:55:39,420 --> 01:55:43,140
He's literally doing this because he likes Among Us.

3542
01:55:43,380 --> 01:55:45,160
He's not even streaming, guys.

3543
01:55:45,160 --> 01:55:45,880
Do you actually like Among Us?

3544
01:55:46,360 --> 01:55:46,880
No.

3545
01:55:47,140 --> 01:55:48,060
Wait, you don't?

3546
01:55:48,060 --> 01:55:50,280
But you said you used to play Among Us a lot.

3547
01:55:51,060 --> 01:55:52,180
No, I stopped playing.

3548
01:55:52,420 --> 01:55:56,880
Because everyone would always first time kill me because I'm too strong and powerful at Among Us.

3549
01:55:57,060 --> 01:55:57,800
Yeah, that's why.

3550
01:55:58,820 --> 01:56:00,700
Yeah, I remember that too.

3551
01:56:03,100 --> 01:56:04,680
I was also one of the Harbingers.

3552
01:56:07,280 --> 01:56:09,040
So don't kill him first.

3553
01:56:09,040 --> 01:56:10,280
That's one of the four horsemen of the apocalypse.

3554
01:56:10,800 --> 01:56:11,980
What does that even mean?

3555
01:56:11,980 --> 01:56:15,320
He was one of the first people that started the Among Us.

3556
01:56:15,400 --> 01:56:15,920
Bad.

3557
01:56:16,040 --> 01:56:16,500
Yeah.

3558
01:56:18,900 --> 01:56:19,820
He was there.

3559
01:56:20,160 --> 01:56:22,580
Look what you did, you fucking asshole.

3560
01:56:23,940 --> 01:56:25,200
Among Us ruined gaming.

3561
01:56:25,800 --> 01:56:26,580
It ruined everything.

3562
01:56:27,140 --> 01:56:27,920
It ruined people.

3563
01:56:29,540 --> 01:56:31,900
And trusting to people.

3564
01:56:31,920 --> 01:56:33,540
You can't trust nobody no more.

3565
01:56:35,060 --> 01:56:39,860
Among Us invented the term gaslighting.

3566
01:56:40,880 --> 01:56:42,880
No, it invented the term sus.

3567
01:56:43,500 --> 01:56:44,180
Sus?

3568
01:56:45,680 --> 01:56:46,360
Hello.

3569
01:56:46,780 --> 01:56:48,280
Are we allowed to play now?

3570
01:56:49,300 --> 01:56:51,700
I am getting your lobby codes.

3571
01:56:51,760 --> 01:56:52,440
Yeah.

3572
01:56:53,060 --> 01:56:54,500
We are on schedule.

3573
01:56:54,500 --> 01:56:55,880
We are actually early now.

3574
01:56:56,040 --> 01:56:56,720
Yeah.

3575
01:57:00,220 --> 01:57:00,900
Wow.

3576
01:57:02,200 --> 01:57:02,500
Wow.

3577
01:57:03,540 --> 01:57:04,140
Don't worry.

3578
01:57:04,240 --> 01:57:07,260
I am going to post your Among Us code in your chat as well, Surefour.

3579
01:57:07,300 --> 01:57:07,760
So they know.

3580
01:57:08,980 --> 01:57:11,660
We are playing against Skibidy Rizzlers.

3581
01:57:12,920 --> 01:57:13,400
Okay.

3582
01:57:13,400 --> 01:57:13,920
We can't lose.

3583
01:57:15,020 --> 01:57:17,040
We lose against Skibidy Rizzlers.

3584
01:57:17,620 --> 01:57:18,100
Are they good?

3585
01:57:18,300 --> 01:57:19,160
Are they good?

3586
01:57:19,800 --> 01:57:23,160
The last game that has happened, the score was 9-2.

3587
01:57:23,520 --> 01:57:25,720
But which team were they fighting against?

3588
01:57:26,240 --> 01:57:27,200
Our first team.

3589
01:57:27,320 --> 01:57:28,600
They were fighting against your first team.

3590
01:57:28,600 --> 01:57:29,080
Oh, okay.

3591
01:57:29,200 --> 01:57:30,920
So we are two points better than them.

3592
01:57:31,620 --> 01:57:32,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3593
01:57:32,300 --> 01:57:32,660
We got it.

3594
01:57:33,540 --> 01:57:34,000
We can win.

3595
01:57:34,600 --> 01:57:36,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3596
01:57:37,400 --> 01:57:38,520
We got this.

3597
01:57:39,120 --> 01:57:41,380
Guys, we are two points better than them.

3598
01:57:41,720 --> 01:57:43,240
Bring them to Queens Row.

3599
01:57:43,440 --> 01:57:44,140
I will show them.

3600
01:57:45,800 --> 01:57:46,640
Queens Row.

3601
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:47,440
Queens Row.

3602
01:57:50,100 --> 01:57:52,460
For the sake of this, this is not on me.

3603
01:57:52,560 --> 01:57:55,200
This was pinged to me by some of your community members.

3604
01:57:55,660 --> 01:57:56,520
Out of the blue.

3605
01:57:56,820 --> 01:57:58,280
Tell Doki to throw the game.

3606
01:57:58,400 --> 01:57:59,740
You have a debut to prepare for.

3607
01:58:00,820 --> 01:58:01,240
Okay.

3608
01:58:01,240 --> 01:58:02,320
But we can just win fast.

3609
01:58:02,640 --> 01:58:03,520
We can literally just win.

3610
01:58:03,540 --> 01:58:08,080
Tell the enemy team to throw the game for me.

3611
01:58:08,100 --> 01:58:09,840
Because today is my celebration day.

3612
01:58:10,160 --> 01:58:10,740
Yeah.

3613
01:58:11,060 --> 01:58:13,460
I have to be happy.

3614
01:58:13,480 --> 01:58:13,840
Yeah.

3615
01:58:15,420 --> 01:58:16,680
Look at the levels.

3616
01:58:16,820 --> 01:58:17,460
Look at the levels.

3617
01:58:17,960 --> 01:58:20,780
5, 13, 9, 9, 11.

3618
01:58:21,200 --> 01:58:24,000
We are better on levels than them.

3619
01:58:24,120 --> 01:58:25,860
Can you rename the bots in this game?

3620
01:58:27,020 --> 01:58:29,640
Just kick RPR.

3621
01:58:29,720 --> 01:58:31,460
Put in a maximum AI bot.

3622
01:58:32,400 --> 01:58:33,120
Rename it.

3623
01:58:33,220 --> 01:58:33,520
I don't know.

3624
01:58:33,520 --> 01:58:35,880
That would be such an improvement.

3625
01:58:36,320 --> 01:58:38,300
That would be such an improvement.

3626
01:58:40,800 --> 01:58:42,200
Dude, you guys are laughing.

3627
01:58:42,340 --> 01:58:43,520
Play on 300 ping then.

3628
01:58:43,600 --> 01:58:44,660
Play on 300 ping then.

3629
01:58:44,800 --> 01:58:46,300
This is your choice.

3630
01:58:46,380 --> 01:58:47,980
Someone beat us right now.

3631
01:58:48,080 --> 01:58:48,980
Give her 300 ping.

3632
01:58:49,040 --> 01:58:50,760
This is literally your choice.

3633
01:58:52,220 --> 01:58:53,180
My life.

3634
01:58:53,180 --> 01:58:54,220
My rules.

3635
01:58:59,120 --> 01:59:00,360
I hate it here.

3636
01:59:00,620 --> 01:59:01,660
I hate this game.

3637
01:59:01,780 --> 01:59:02,800
No, I love this game.

3638
01:59:02,820 --> 01:59:03,400
I hate you guys.

3639
01:59:03,520 --> 01:59:03,620
But yes.

3640
01:59:05,820 --> 01:59:07,400
I personally love this game.

3641
01:59:07,400 --> 01:59:11,080
This is all recorded for the But yes.

3642
01:59:11,080 --> 01:59:15,060
I corrected myself because I actually do like this game, but you guys make it terrible for me.

3643
01:59:15,600 --> 01:59:16,600
RPR heads or tails?

3644
01:59:17,680 --> 01:59:18,120
Tails.

3645
01:59:19,160 --> 01:59:20,040
He says...

3646
01:59:20,700 --> 01:59:21,740
Wait, you gotta write it.

3647
01:59:22,720 --> 01:59:24,980
You don't even know what side we're on.

3648
01:59:26,960 --> 01:59:28,180
RPR English or Spanish?

3649
01:59:30,420 --> 01:59:30,860
Eh?

3650
01:59:33,760 --> 01:59:35,320
Do you not know the meme?

3651
01:59:35,440 --> 01:59:36,060
Come on.

3652
01:59:36,260 --> 01:59:37,620
Oh, he doesn't know the meme!

3653
01:59:37,620 --> 01:59:39,580
I know, it's English or Spanish.

3654
01:59:39,740 --> 01:59:42,140
I don't play by your rules.

3655
01:59:42,740 --> 01:59:44,320
Just say English or Spanish!

3656
01:59:44,560 --> 01:59:45,180
I should've won tails!

3657
01:59:48,480 --> 01:59:49,660
Wait, what did we get?

3658
01:59:49,960 --> 01:59:51,620
Are you doing defense or attack?

3659
01:59:51,740 --> 01:59:52,000
We lost.

3660
01:59:52,520 --> 01:59:53,960
We've lost every coin flip.

3661
01:59:54,440 --> 01:59:55,940
No, we won the first one.

3662
01:59:56,280 --> 01:59:58,320
But we were always defensing.

3663
01:59:59,420 --> 02:00:00,680
Because I chose defense.

3664
02:00:02,020 --> 02:00:02,520
Oh.

3665
02:00:03,200 --> 02:00:07,600
You don't even know which side is defense or attack.

3666
02:00:07,620 --> 02:00:08,160
Attack side.

3667
02:00:12,240 --> 02:00:13,240
Ain't no way.

3668
02:00:13,340 --> 02:00:14,500
There ain't no way in us.

3669
02:00:14,940 --> 02:00:16,820
Oh my god, we're gonna lose again.

3670
02:00:17,060 --> 02:00:18,060
Defense side is B.

3671
02:00:19,300 --> 02:00:21,140
Why there ain't no way in us?

3672
02:00:21,760 --> 02:00:22,800
What did we do?

3673
02:00:25,640 --> 02:00:26,400
Among us.

3674
02:00:27,700 --> 02:00:31,260
I can't believe Surefour didn't actually start his Among Us lobby.

3675
02:00:32,460 --> 02:00:33,460
Wait, did you not?

3676
02:00:34,040 --> 02:00:35,060
No, it was B!

3677
02:00:35,340 --> 02:00:38,060
We were gonna give you people to play with, Surefour.

3678
02:00:40,800 --> 02:00:41,660
That's fucked up.

3679
02:00:41,900 --> 02:00:42,800
Wait, can I?

3680
02:00:42,860 --> 02:00:45,500
You can't trust the VTuber fans.

3681
02:00:45,800 --> 02:00:45,860
No!

3682
02:00:46,840 --> 02:00:47,360
Cool.

3683
02:00:48,020 --> 02:00:50,200
They'll join my Among Us lobby and dox me.

3684
02:00:51,120 --> 02:00:52,160
Oh shit!

3685
02:00:54,240 --> 02:00:54,760
Sussy.

3686
02:01:02,130 --> 02:01:02,650
Ugh.

3687
02:01:02,650 --> 02:01:03,950
What are we waiting for?

3688
02:01:05,250 --> 02:01:07,310
Are they still deciding attack or defense?

3689
02:01:08,310 --> 02:01:10,710
They just said ain't no way and then nothing else.

3690
02:01:11,970 --> 02:01:13,690
I thought that was one of the admins.

3691
02:01:13,710 --> 02:01:14,850
Why didn't he wanna swap?

3692
02:01:15,350 --> 02:01:16,790
I guess we swap.

3693
02:01:17,070 --> 02:01:18,170
Oh, we swap, yeah.

3694
02:01:20,270 --> 02:01:21,530
Am I swapping?

3695
02:01:22,490 --> 02:01:23,210
I'll go here.

3696
02:01:24,990 --> 02:01:25,630
Alright.

3697
02:01:25,890 --> 02:01:26,810
I swap.

3698
02:01:27,510 --> 02:01:28,570
They want defense.

3699
02:01:28,570 --> 02:01:30,350
They made a grave mistake.

3700
02:01:30,730 --> 02:01:33,330
But we always suck at attack.

3701
02:01:34,410 --> 02:01:36,130
They made a grave mistake.

3702
02:01:36,630 --> 02:01:37,890
We've done the worst.

3703
02:01:37,890 --> 02:01:38,430
Joke's over.

3704
02:01:38,590 --> 02:01:39,130
Your day.

3705
02:01:41,630 --> 02:01:43,570
Welcome to my world.

3706
02:01:44,330 --> 02:01:44,930
Welcome to my world.

3707
02:01:44,930 --> 02:01:49,890
Have we all figured out what we wanna sure for already after calling you out?

3708
02:01:50,050 --> 02:01:50,250
Sure for already after calling you out?

3709
02:01:51,050 --> 02:01:52,250
Watch this!

3710
02:01:58,160 --> 02:01:59,760
Watch this is crazy.

3711
02:02:00,580 --> 02:02:03,200
Yeah, we're entering the game!

3712
02:02:03,460 --> 02:02:04,820
Alright, which map is this?

3713
02:02:05,300 --> 02:02:06,320
Wait, that's us!

3714
02:02:07,320 --> 02:02:07,920
What's this?

3715
02:02:08,100 --> 02:02:08,880
Valerie map?

3716
02:02:10,680 --> 02:02:12,400
We are playing a wallhack, bitch.

3717
02:02:12,780 --> 02:02:14,440
What does Sova say when they ult?

3718
02:02:15,760 --> 02:02:17,220
I don't fucking know.

3719
02:02:18,120 --> 02:02:19,560
Can I play the healer now?

3720
02:02:19,700 --> 02:02:21,400
Because we're attacking instead of the goo lady?

3721
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:23,700
You can play whatever you want, man.

3722
02:02:24,180 --> 02:02:25,360
You know what you're doing.

3723
02:02:25,600 --> 02:02:28,080
Oh, I almost forgot to...

3724
02:02:28,080 --> 02:02:29,000
Nades, nades, nades!

3725
02:02:30,860 --> 02:02:32,620
I'm gonna run flash.

3726
02:02:33,500 --> 02:02:34,480
Flash bang!

3727
02:02:34,920 --> 02:02:36,480
In Windstorm.

3728
02:02:39,300 --> 02:02:39,800
Guys...

3729
02:02:39,800 --> 02:02:40,580
Guys...

3730
02:02:40,600 --> 02:02:42,120
Do you think we can win, guys?

3731
02:02:42,780 --> 02:02:43,760
I do.

3732
02:02:44,880 --> 02:02:45,380
Alright.

3733
02:02:45,880 --> 02:02:47,340
You guys play like bitches!

3734
02:02:48,260 --> 02:02:50,540
Okay, sure, but why don't you be IGL?

3735
02:02:50,540 --> 02:02:51,640
Why don't you be IGL?

3736
02:02:52,580 --> 02:02:53,400
I can't.

3737
02:02:55,720 --> 02:02:57,200
What is this?

3738
02:02:58,220 --> 02:02:59,040
Why can't you?

3739
02:03:00,160 --> 02:03:02,600
Because if I AGL, the demon comes out.

3740
02:03:04,220 --> 02:03:06,640
I know this map!

3741
02:03:06,900 --> 02:03:07,940
This is the Valerie map!

3742
02:03:08,180 --> 02:03:08,720
That's what I'm saying!

3743
02:03:09,140 --> 02:03:10,160
Look, they even have the flowerpots!

3744
02:03:10,920 --> 02:03:12,540
They have the flowerpot in the middle!

3745
02:03:12,640 --> 02:03:15,520
The admin instantly leaves as soon as we start talking about Valerie.

3746
02:03:17,200 --> 02:03:18,780
Wait, which side are we going?

3747
02:03:20,300 --> 02:03:23,240
I'm not the IGL, but I think B is nice.

3748
02:03:23,500 --> 02:03:25,980
I can easily push this with my wallhack.

3749
02:03:26,800 --> 02:03:27,800
I'm with next then.

3750
02:03:27,920 --> 02:03:28,540
I'm with him.

3751
02:03:29,180 --> 02:03:31,100
Oh my god, her boob is in 2D mode.

3752
02:03:31,100 --> 02:03:31,760
I can kill you as well.

3753
02:03:35,280 --> 02:03:35,960
I'm goody.

3754
02:03:38,220 --> 02:03:39,180
I'm next to you.

3755
02:03:39,260 --> 02:03:40,080
Oh, there's people here, yeah.

3756
02:03:40,680 --> 02:03:41,820
I got one on onehack.

3757
02:03:41,820 --> 02:03:42,380
One on onehack.

3758
02:03:43,460 --> 02:03:44,340
Swing last!

3759
02:03:45,080 --> 02:03:47,640
Dude, your wind fucked me.

3760
02:03:49,100 --> 02:03:49,920
He's pushing up.

3761
02:03:51,280 --> 02:03:52,160
Oh, surefour.

3762
02:03:52,440 --> 02:03:53,280
He's one though.

3763
02:03:54,180 --> 02:03:54,880
Be on your way.

3764
02:03:56,740 --> 02:03:57,560
There's two of them!

3765
02:03:57,700 --> 02:03:58,260
I got one.

3766
02:03:59,180 --> 02:04:00,620
It's a 2v2.

3767
02:04:01,140 --> 02:04:02,300
Can I get surefour up?

3768
02:04:02,360 --> 02:04:03,320
How much time you got?

3769
02:04:03,800 --> 02:04:04,600
I don't know.

3770
02:04:04,820 --> 02:04:05,640
One more up there.

3771
02:04:05,640 --> 02:04:06,780
Rescuing, rescuing.

3772
02:04:07,280 --> 02:04:08,000
You see him?

3773
02:04:09,420 --> 02:04:10,500
Oh, that's a lot.

3774
02:04:10,680 --> 02:04:11,980
He's right here, guys.

3775
02:04:13,380 --> 02:04:14,560
Revive me, revive me.

3776
02:04:15,500 --> 02:04:17,240
He's throwing bomba.

3777
02:04:17,540 --> 02:04:19,100
Come to me, Ipeen, come to me.

3778
02:04:19,200 --> 02:04:19,980
Oh, he's dead.

3779
02:04:20,560 --> 02:04:21,180
Oh, flashbang.

3780
02:04:21,840 --> 02:04:23,560
I'm blind, I'm blind!

3781
02:04:24,200 --> 02:04:25,000
It's one guy.

3782
02:04:25,340 --> 02:04:26,360
It's literally one guy.

3783
02:04:28,140 --> 02:04:29,420
Don't get one guy.

3784
02:04:31,920 --> 02:04:33,740
Don't get one guy, please.

3785
02:04:33,740 --> 02:04:35,100
I see him, I see him.

3786
02:04:37,680 --> 02:04:38,140
Smoking.

3787
02:04:39,060 --> 02:04:39,520
Smoking.

3788
02:04:39,540 --> 02:04:40,260
I'm gonna plant the bomb.

3789
02:04:40,920 --> 02:04:41,840
Watch me.

3790
02:04:42,900 --> 02:04:43,820
He's on the roof!

3791
02:04:46,040 --> 02:04:48,360
Are you still planning after that?

3792
02:04:48,600 --> 02:04:48,880
Don't surefour.

3793
02:04:48,920 --> 02:04:49,720
On the right side.

3794
02:04:51,440 --> 02:04:52,540
I'm gonna slow him.

3795
02:04:53,520 --> 02:04:55,380
That was a good shot.

3796
02:04:55,680 --> 02:04:56,560
That was a good shot.

3797
02:04:56,560 --> 02:04:56,820
360.

3798
02:04:58,960 --> 02:05:00,420
Buy armor, buy armor.

3799
02:05:00,980 --> 02:05:02,340
I'm gonna get heavy armor.

3800
02:05:03,740 --> 02:05:03,840
Come on.

3801
02:05:05,060 --> 02:05:07,480
I'm not living long enough for regen, guys.

3802
02:05:09,560 --> 02:05:10,980
Number one, Vecrolai.

3803
02:05:11,280 --> 02:05:12,700
Who are we pushing?

3804
02:05:13,140 --> 02:05:15,720
I just do the same thing.

3805
02:05:15,980 --> 02:05:16,380
I got pictures.

3806
02:05:17,540 --> 02:05:18,960
I'm fully supported.

3807
02:05:19,040 --> 02:05:22,260
Guys, rule of thumb is do until it don't work.

3808
02:05:22,620 --> 02:05:23,160
I'm gonna...

3809
02:05:23,740 --> 02:05:25,700
I'm gonna queue this door.

3810
02:05:25,900 --> 02:05:27,320
Because that's how he got us last time.

3811
02:05:27,680 --> 02:05:28,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3812
02:05:28,460 --> 02:05:29,760
Someone hold that and then see.

3813
02:05:30,960 --> 02:05:32,600
Do until no more work.

3814
02:05:33,120 --> 02:05:33,600
Do until no more work.

3815
02:05:34,380 --> 02:05:35,640
One to the right side.

3816
02:05:36,100 --> 02:05:37,440
I'm looking for us.

3817
02:05:37,560 --> 02:05:38,300
I built a wall.

3818
02:05:39,480 --> 02:05:40,740
He painted it.

3819
02:05:40,800 --> 02:05:41,980
I'm looking at flank right now.

3820
02:05:42,340 --> 02:05:44,080
They're gone.

3821
02:05:45,820 --> 02:05:47,020
We wanna go right?

3822
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:48,440
Or no?

3823
02:05:49,920 --> 02:05:51,360
I got B long.

3824
02:05:51,560 --> 02:05:52,300
I'm pushing.

3825
02:05:52,580 --> 02:05:54,280
I'm looking at our flanks, guys.

3826
02:05:56,080 --> 02:05:57,800
I'm smoking this.

3827
02:05:58,520 --> 02:05:59,360
That's my wall.

3828
02:05:59,460 --> 02:05:59,980
That's our wall.

3829
02:06:00,880 --> 02:06:02,180
I'm gonna hold this.

3830
02:06:02,220 --> 02:06:02,780
I'm holding this.

3831
02:06:03,740 --> 02:06:04,220
I'm gonna plant.

3832
02:06:04,360 --> 02:06:06,540
You plant the bomb.

3833
02:06:07,200 --> 02:06:08,140
I'm gonna flash deep.

3834
02:06:08,700 --> 02:06:09,380
I'm gonna spot it.

3835
02:06:11,280 --> 02:06:11,940
I'm flashing.

3836
02:06:12,600 --> 02:06:13,800
I'm gonna throw a nade.

3837
02:06:14,680 --> 02:06:16,080
I'm watching top lane.

3838
02:06:17,120 --> 02:06:18,640
I threw a nade over there.

3839
02:06:19,760 --> 02:06:20,560
I'm so good.

3840
02:06:20,800 --> 02:06:21,680
We got the bomb.

3841
02:06:22,740 --> 02:06:24,100
I'm covering for you next.

3842
02:06:25,460 --> 02:06:26,580
They're not here, I think.

3843
02:06:27,080 --> 02:06:27,900
I got one.

3844
02:06:29,620 --> 02:06:30,780
One next to me.

3845
02:06:32,200 --> 02:06:33,240
One of you just in case.

3846
02:06:33,740 --> 02:06:34,320
Close left.

3847
02:06:35,480 --> 02:06:36,580
Two of them.

3848
02:06:36,940 --> 02:06:37,600
He's dead.

3849
02:06:38,400 --> 02:06:39,600
On me.

3850
02:06:41,440 --> 02:06:42,160
Oh shit.

3851
02:06:42,340 --> 02:06:43,220
I got another one.

3852
02:06:45,520 --> 02:06:47,040
We're playing Valorant, guys.

3853
02:06:47,160 --> 02:06:48,740
We're actually playing Valorant.

3854
02:06:52,520 --> 02:06:55,080
Keep going until no longer work.

3855
02:06:55,340 --> 02:06:56,800
We're looking at corners.

3856
02:06:57,040 --> 02:06:58,520
And playing slow.

3857
02:06:59,580 --> 02:07:01,200
Keep doing until no longer work.

3858
02:07:01,200 --> 02:07:02,160
Let's push A.

3859
02:07:03,740 --> 02:07:04,660
What the fuck?

3860
02:07:04,680 --> 02:07:06,620
Keep doing until no longer work.

3861
02:07:07,020 --> 02:07:08,260
Push A.

3862
02:07:08,460 --> 02:07:12,080
We gotta follow Sheriff because he's gonna push A.

3863
02:07:12,740 --> 02:07:13,880
I'm pushing A.

3864
02:07:15,960 --> 02:07:17,480
We're gonna lose this round.

3865
02:07:17,480 --> 02:07:18,800
We're playing Stranova, guys.

3866
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:19,880
We're playing Stranova.

3867
02:07:21,820 --> 02:07:23,080
I'm just embossing you.

3868
02:07:23,080 --> 02:07:23,880
I'm gonna be insane.

3869
02:07:24,940 --> 02:07:26,380
I don't know how they show up.

3870
02:07:26,460 --> 02:07:27,480
I've never played this map before.

3871
02:07:27,480 --> 02:07:28,380
I'm making wall.

3872
02:07:31,420 --> 02:07:32,660
Pushing with the wall.

3873
02:07:34,660 --> 02:07:35,280
I'm smoking.

3874
02:07:36,020 --> 02:07:37,200
I'm going invisibility mode.

3875
02:07:37,380 --> 02:07:38,280
I plant bomb.

3876
02:07:39,530 --> 02:07:40,400
Please hold me.

3877
02:07:40,540 --> 02:07:42,040
Bomb planting.

3878
02:07:42,380 --> 02:07:43,580
It was bad.

3879
02:07:44,180 --> 02:07:46,020
The bear is coming over here.

3880
02:07:46,620 --> 02:07:48,400
I'm playing invisible on site.

3881
02:07:48,540 --> 02:07:49,100
The bear...

3882
02:07:53,040 --> 02:07:53,840
He's nading.

3883
02:07:54,880 --> 02:07:55,580
He's one.

3884
02:07:55,800 --> 02:07:56,680
Get his ass.

3885
02:07:56,940 --> 02:07:57,920
He naded.

3886
02:07:58,040 --> 02:07:58,600
Next.

3887
02:07:58,600 --> 02:07:58,980
Next.

3888
02:08:00,440 --> 02:08:01,480
Jett revive me.

3889
02:08:02,220 --> 02:08:03,560
Three guys here.

3890
02:08:03,680 --> 02:08:04,240
Three guys here.

3891
02:08:05,780 --> 02:08:06,900
Three dudes.

3892
02:08:07,320 --> 02:08:07,660
Help me.

3893
02:08:09,160 --> 02:08:10,180
Behind you.

3894
02:08:12,780 --> 02:08:13,540
He's one.

3895
02:08:14,040 --> 02:08:15,840
I got flash.

3896
02:08:16,480 --> 02:08:18,160
I'm not the best.

3897
02:08:19,140 --> 02:08:20,020
I got another.

3898
02:08:20,620 --> 02:08:21,400
Play bomb.

3899
02:08:22,340 --> 02:08:22,820
One HP.

3900
02:08:23,900 --> 02:08:25,100
One HP on one guy.

3901
02:08:25,100 --> 02:08:25,860
Oh.

3902
02:08:26,100 --> 02:08:26,620
Oh.

3903
02:08:27,500 --> 02:08:28,020
Yeah.

3904
02:08:30,300 --> 02:08:31,200
We got bomb.

3905
02:08:32,100 --> 02:08:32,820
I think.

3906
02:08:33,300 --> 02:08:33,820
Yeah.

3907
02:08:35,780 --> 02:08:36,820
Double kill.

3908
02:08:37,520 --> 02:08:38,040
Yeah.

3909
02:08:38,240 --> 02:08:39,940
We played Tranova guys.

3910
02:08:43,380 --> 02:08:44,860
We're doing it.

3911
02:08:44,940 --> 02:08:46,060
We're doing Tranova.

3912
02:08:46,460 --> 02:08:47,720
Now we're running back B.

3913
02:08:47,780 --> 02:08:48,360
Running back B.

3914
02:08:48,380 --> 02:08:48,820
Running it back.

3915
02:08:52,100 --> 02:08:52,620
Wait.

3916
02:08:52,840 --> 02:08:53,120
Next.

3917
02:08:53,360 --> 02:08:53,880
Yeah.

3918
02:08:55,100 --> 02:08:55,400
Someone.

3919
02:08:55,400 --> 02:08:56,800
You can just literally double kill him.

3920
02:08:56,820 --> 02:08:57,300
I'm gonna ult you.

3921
02:08:58,920 --> 02:08:59,940
Hard double kill.

3922
02:09:00,080 --> 02:09:01,300
What does your thingy do?

3923
02:09:01,500 --> 02:09:02,760
I give you fucking...

3924
02:09:03,780 --> 02:09:04,700
Oh my god.

3925
02:09:07,680 --> 02:09:09,040
I am always right.

3926
02:09:09,700 --> 02:09:10,840
Shurper did the right call.

3927
02:09:11,640 --> 02:09:12,800
Just tell me if you're pushing.

3928
02:09:15,340 --> 02:09:16,240
Oh I'm going.

3929
02:09:16,360 --> 02:09:16,540
I'm going.

3930
02:09:16,620 --> 02:09:17,480
I messed up the...

3931
02:09:18,440 --> 02:09:19,680
I'm looking at the...

3932
02:09:20,520 --> 02:09:21,280
It didn't work.

3933
02:09:21,380 --> 02:09:22,880
He's dead.

3934
02:09:23,240 --> 02:09:23,780
Help me.

3935
02:09:25,300 --> 02:09:26,260
I res'd.

3936
02:09:27,140 --> 02:09:27,660
Help him.

3937
02:09:28,320 --> 02:09:29,000
There's more.

3938
02:09:29,060 --> 02:09:29,380
There's more.

3939
02:09:29,460 --> 02:09:29,640
Help.

3940
02:09:31,620 --> 02:09:32,580
Help me.

3941
02:09:32,680 --> 02:09:33,460
Help me now.

3942
02:09:33,980 --> 02:09:34,760
Me next.

3943
02:09:34,780 --> 02:09:35,120
Plant the bomb.

3944
02:09:36,300 --> 02:09:37,480
Oh my god.

3945
02:09:37,520 --> 02:09:39,500
There's like ice bears and big bears.

3946
02:09:39,540 --> 02:09:39,780
Okay.

3947
02:09:40,180 --> 02:09:41,420
I got one but they're res'ing.

3948
02:09:41,660 --> 02:09:42,280
Plant the bomb.

3949
02:09:44,720 --> 02:09:46,120
They got the res off.

3950
02:09:47,300 --> 02:09:49,760
Now he's coming over to finish the job.

3951
02:09:52,860 --> 02:09:53,820
One more.

3952
02:09:53,880 --> 02:09:53,940
One more.

3953
02:09:54,120 --> 02:09:54,780
Two more.

3954
02:09:55,820 --> 02:09:57,100
Okay this is a 2v3.

3955
02:10:00,840 --> 02:10:02,340
Oh that was a good nade.

3956
02:10:04,420 --> 02:10:05,160
Fuck he's low.

3957
02:10:05,300 --> 02:10:06,480
They're both here on me.

3958
02:10:06,520 --> 02:10:06,780
On me.

3959
02:10:06,820 --> 02:10:07,180
On my...

3960
02:10:07,180 --> 02:10:07,840
It's okay.

3961
02:10:07,960 --> 02:10:08,580
It's a 2v...

3962
02:10:08,580 --> 02:10:10,820
It's a 1v... Oh it's a 1v3.

3963
02:10:10,900 --> 02:10:11,740
It's not okay anymore.

3964
02:10:13,580 --> 02:10:14,240
It's okay.

3965
02:10:15,200 --> 02:10:16,220
I'm clutch master.

3966
02:10:19,340 --> 02:10:21,100
You have 5 HP.

3967
02:10:21,100 --> 02:10:21,560
5 HP.

3968
02:10:22,660 --> 02:10:24,540
Oh he has 106.

3969
02:10:25,120 --> 02:10:26,920
The armor's fucking...

3970
02:10:26,920 --> 02:10:27,280
God.

3971
02:10:29,600 --> 02:10:31,200
Where the fuck killing me?

3972
02:10:31,440 --> 02:10:31,960
Okay.

3973
02:10:31,960 --> 02:10:32,640
Okay next.

3974
02:10:32,720 --> 02:10:34,280
You become strong but not warm enough.

3975
02:10:34,280 --> 02:10:35,900
Where the fuck did they shoot me from?

3976
02:10:36,040 --> 02:10:37,600
But not warm you free strong.

3977
02:10:37,920 --> 02:10:39,080
I wasn't sure.

3978
02:10:39,240 --> 02:10:39,600
You know.

3979
02:10:39,800 --> 02:10:43,600
Was he standing on that fucking box?

3980
02:10:43,960 --> 02:10:44,300
What?

3981
02:10:44,320 --> 02:10:45,480
What happened?

3982
02:10:45,600 --> 02:10:47,060
He said you're clutch master.

3983
02:10:47,060 --> 02:10:47,500
Back away.

3984
02:10:47,620 --> 02:10:48,060
Back away.

3985
02:10:48,060 --> 02:10:48,380
Back away.

3986
02:10:49,080 --> 02:10:49,520
Sometime.

3987
02:10:52,120 --> 02:10:52,880
Sometime you winning.

3988
02:10:53,080 --> 02:10:53,820
Sometime you losing.

3989
02:10:54,080 --> 02:10:55,000
Yeah yeah we go A.

3990
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:55,480
We go A?

3991
02:10:56,060 --> 02:10:56,820
Oh okay.

3992
02:10:57,100 --> 02:10:59,220
You only do until it all work.

3993
02:10:59,280 --> 02:11:01,140
And then when no work we go other stuff.

3994
02:11:01,360 --> 02:11:02,540
But last time A worked.

3995
02:11:03,080 --> 02:11:04,740
But B didn't work that game.

3996
02:11:05,320 --> 02:11:06,020
Guys we got it.

3997
02:11:06,060 --> 02:11:08,040
Guys we can't just suddenly stop being teamwork.

3998
02:11:08,120 --> 02:11:08,680
Okay guys?

3999
02:11:10,320 --> 02:11:11,140
Guys teamwork.

4000
02:11:13,540 --> 02:11:13,980
Alright.

4001
02:11:14,120 --> 02:11:14,440
Oh.

4002
02:11:15,980 --> 02:11:16,860
One clip.

4003
02:11:16,980 --> 02:11:17,220
One clip.

4004
02:11:17,360 --> 02:11:17,700
One clip.

4005
02:11:18,060 --> 02:11:18,320
Alright.

4006
02:11:20,420 --> 02:11:21,300
Self-presure.

4007
02:11:21,560 --> 02:11:21,600
Nooo.

4008
02:11:22,040 --> 02:11:23,360
I double push.

4009
02:11:23,460 --> 02:11:23,840
One shot.

4010
02:11:24,380 --> 02:11:24,820
Sniper.

4011
02:11:25,060 --> 02:11:25,500
Sniper.

4012
02:11:27,260 --> 02:11:28,140
I flashbang.

4013
02:11:29,140 --> 02:11:30,020
I have no smoke.

4014
02:11:31,140 --> 02:11:31,580
I'm.

4015
02:11:31,640 --> 02:11:32,340
Why am I flying?

4016
02:11:32,380 --> 02:11:33,260
Oh what the fuck.

4017
02:11:33,320 --> 02:11:33,640
Okay.

4018
02:11:34,500 --> 02:11:35,320
Did we have.

4019
02:11:36,700 --> 02:11:37,780
Let's split the bomb guys.

4020
02:11:37,880 --> 02:11:39,000
Who has the bomb?

4021
02:11:39,120 --> 02:11:39,840
Who has the bomb?

4022
02:11:39,860 --> 02:11:40,120
Me me.

4023
02:11:40,160 --> 02:11:40,760
But I can't.

4024
02:11:40,760 --> 02:11:41,300
They're everywhere.

4025
02:11:41,760 --> 02:11:42,640
I'm holding.

4026
02:11:42,900 --> 02:11:45,060
Yeah hold me then.

4027
02:11:46,180 --> 02:11:47,060
Okay I got one.

4030
02:11:51,140 --> 02:11:51,860
Nice bomb.

4031
02:11:51,960 --> 02:11:52,220
Nice bomb.

4032
02:11:52,280 --> 02:11:52,560
Nice bomb.

4033
02:11:52,700 --> 02:11:53,980
I'm here in the water.

4034
02:11:54,680 --> 02:11:55,160
Guys.

4035
02:11:55,300 --> 02:11:56,380
I'm so safe.

4036
02:11:56,400 --> 02:11:56,940
I'm blind.

4037
02:11:57,320 --> 02:11:57,980
Get fucked.

4038
02:11:58,240 --> 02:11:59,440

4039
02:11:59,440 --> 02:12:00,320
Trust me.

4040
02:12:00,900 --> 02:12:01,580
Yeah okay.

4041
02:12:01,740 --> 02:12:02,520
I'm gonna die for you.

4042
02:12:03,640 --> 02:12:04,120
Okay.

4043
02:12:07,340 --> 02:12:09,840
Oh no it's a turret.

4044
02:12:10,100 --> 02:12:10,700
Oh no.

4045
02:12:10,940 --> 02:12:11,200
Oh no.

4046
02:12:11,320 --> 02:12:12,000
I got this.

4047
02:12:12,080 --> 02:12:12,340
I got this.

4048
02:12:14,300 --> 02:12:16,000
Did you actually got this?

4049
02:12:17,160 --> 02:12:18,200
2v3 situation.

4050
02:12:18,460 --> 02:12:18,720
I kill you next.

4051
02:12:18,800 --> 02:12:19,040

4052
02:12:20,300 --> 02:12:20,820
Yeah.

4053

Got him.

4054
02:12:23,820 --> 02:12:26,320
Wait our peer has 200 ping this time.

4055
02:12:26,720 --> 02:12:28,500
He actually has good ping.

4056
02:12:29,040 --> 02:12:31,780
Does anyone else wants to plant the bomb?

4057
02:12:31,980 --> 02:12:32,360
No.

4058
02:12:35,780 --> 02:12:36,620
We're going B.

4059
02:12:37,380 --> 02:12:38,480
No it's okay.

4060
02:12:38,800 --> 02:12:40,100
You can go plant it.

4061
02:12:40,440 --> 02:12:41,820
I did it.

4062
02:12:42,700 --> 02:12:43,720
You're the support.

4063
02:12:43,860 --> 02:12:45,040
Support always plant bombs.

4064
02:12:46,060 --> 02:12:46,860
Go B.

4065
02:12:47,060 --> 02:12:48,840
More B long.

4066
02:12:49,460 --> 02:12:50,600
We succeeded A.

4067
02:12:50,600 --> 02:12:52,980
What if we all stand like this and push.

4068
02:12:55,320 --> 02:12:55,900
I'm down.

4069
02:12:56,160 --> 02:12:56,560
Alright.

4070
02:12:56,820 --> 02:12:58,300
There's no way they'll see us.

4071
02:12:58,440 --> 02:12:58,540
Right?

4072
02:12:59,140 --> 02:12:59,540
Yeah.

4073
02:12:59,700 --> 02:13:00,400
There's no way.

4074
02:13:00,780 --> 02:13:01,820
We're just a bunch of enemy girls.

4075
02:13:03,940 --> 02:13:04,740
Hold on.

4076
02:13:05,600 --> 02:13:06,660
Okay now they'll see us.

4077
02:13:06,720 --> 02:13:07,400
B long clear.

4078
02:13:07,540 --> 02:13:08,140
B long clear.

4079
02:13:08,600 --> 02:13:09,480
Okay we're fucking around.

4080
02:13:09,720 --> 02:13:10,580
We're fucking around right now.

4081
02:13:10,680 --> 02:13:12,000
Even though I don't have a lot of time.

4082
02:13:12,540 --> 02:13:13,560
They're not really coming.

4083
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:16,520
They're pushing all the way B long.

4084
02:13:16,600 --> 02:13:18,000
They're not coming.

4085
02:13:18,060 --> 02:13:18,780
They're not coming.

4086
02:13:18,780 --> 02:13:19,820
I feel like we should help.

4087
02:13:20,880 --> 02:13:21,680
Go A.

4088
02:13:21,700 --> 02:13:22,060
Go A.

4089
02:13:22,120 --> 02:13:22,460

There's a bear.

4093
02:13:25,380 --> 02:13:25,960
There's a bear.

4094
02:13:26,100 --> 02:13:27,140
There's a bear.

4095
02:13:29,540 --> 02:13:30,340
I'm getting boomed.

4096
02:13:30,340 --> 02:13:30,760
They know.

4097
02:13:30,820 --> 02:13:31,360
They know.

4098
02:13:32,560 --> 02:13:32,960
Okay.

4099
02:13:33,180 --> 02:13:34,200

They're coming.

4101
02:13:37,180 --> 02:13:37,980
Oh no.

4102
02:13:38,800 --> 02:13:40,020
Guys we're not pushing.

4103
02:13:40,260 --> 02:13:40,660

4104
02:13:40,840 --> 02:13:41,240
No.

4105
02:13:41,240 --> 02:13:41,540
No.

4106
02:13:41,540 --> 02:13:42,620
We're pushing with...

4107
02:13:42,620 --> 02:13:43,840
Oh you're dead.

4108
02:13:44,100 --> 02:13:46,260

02:13:49,780 --> 02:13:51,200
Sorry I didn't know we were gonna go there.

4115
02:13:51,480 --> 02:13:52,800
I didn't know we were gonna go there.

4116
02:13:53,260 --> 02:13:54,460
They're watching mid and mid end.

4117
02:13:54,880 --> 02:13:55,900
Oh you're so good.

4118
02:13:56,620 --> 02:13:56,980

4119
02:13:58,380 --> 02:13:58,920

02:14:05,820 --> 02:14:05,960
Wait.

4128
02:14:05,960 --> 02:14:06,820
I'm building a wall.

4129
02:14:06,960 --> 02:14:07,400
Just move.

4130
02:14:07,540 --> 02:14:08,060
Just move.

4131
02:14:08,140 --> 02:14:08,400
Okay.

4132
02:14:08,460 --> 02:14:09,500

4133
02:14:10,400 --> 02:14:11,560

4136
02:14:14,920 --> 02:14:16,260
Someone got the bomba.

4137
02:14:16,980 --> 02:14:17,720

4138
02:14:18,300 --> 02:14:18,740

4139
02:14:18,860 --> 02:14:19,300
Solo.

4140
02:14:19,300 --> 02:14:19,620

4146
02:14:23,920 --> 02:14:24,220
The ice girl.

4147
02:14:26,280 --> 02:14:27,140
Where's the ice girl?

4148
02:14:27,600 --> 02:14:28,640
Oh my god.

4151
02:14:29,660 --> 02:14:30,840
Why are you deagling?

4152
02:14:31,040 --> 02:14:31,980
Why are you deagling?

4153
02:14:31,980 --> 02:14:33,560
That's how to reload the other gun.

4154
02:14:35,340 --> 02:14:37,900
Buy the other pistol.

4155
02:14:38,040 --> 02:14:39,120

You guys stop fucking around guys.

02:14:47,600 --> 02:14:48,360
It's 4-2.

4163
02:14:48,440 --> 02:14:49,280
They can turn this around.

4164
02:14:50,480 --> 02:14:51,000

4165
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:51,280

02:14:56,780 --> 02:14:57,240
Wait.

4171
02:14:57,380 --> 02:14:58,380
Someone is AFK.

4172
02:14:58,420 --> 02:14:58,680
Oh okay.

4173
02:14:58,840 --> 02:15:00,060
I was like who's that AFK?

4174
02:15:00,180 --> 02:15:00,360
Okay.

02:15:05,520 --> 02:15:06,820
I'm queuing right side now.

4179
02:15:06,820 --> 02:15:07,260
Big mistake maybe.

02:15:13,440 --> 02:15:14,100
Oh shit.

4184
02:15:14,140 --> 02:15:14,540
Oh shit.

02:15:14,540 --> 02:15:14,940
Oh I've been spotted.

4186
02:15:14,960 --> 02:15:16,140
I've been spotted by Fushia.

4187
02:15:17,100 --> 02:15:17,420
Okay.

4188
02:15:17,420 --> 02:15:18,680
They know about our...

4189
02:15:18,680 --> 02:15:19,300
I'm going the right.

4190
02:15:19,300 --> 02:15:20,140
I'm looking at right side.

4191
02:15:21,180 --> 02:15:21,500

4194
02:15:22,240 --> 02:15:23,340
I cut off.

4195
02:15:24,420 --> 02:15:25,620
I'm getting rid of the bear.

4196
02:15:25,620 --> 02:15:26,200
I'm getting rid of the bear.

4197
02:15:26,200 --> 02:15:26,700
I got rid of the bear.

4198
02:15:26,740 --> 02:15:27,200
I got rid of the bear.

4199
02:15:27,320 --> 02:15:27,880
They're trying to push.

4200
02:15:27,980 --> 02:15:28,240
They're trying to push.

4201
02:15:28,240 --> 02:15:29,040
That guy got smoked.

4202
02:15:29,200 --> 02:15:29,620

4206
02:15:35,280 --> 02:15:35,420

4207
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:37,360
Wait.

4208
02:15:37,380 --> 02:15:38,080
I'm getting shot from behind.

4209
02:15:38,180 --> 02:15:39,940
Where am I getting shot from?

4210
02:15:41,200 --> 02:15:41,780
Flat bomb.

4211
02:15:43,740 --> 02:15:44,360
He's bomb himself.

4212
02:15:44,600 --> 02:15:45,100
She's up.

4213
02:15:45,100 --> 02:15:45,360
She's up.

4214
02:15:45,440 --> 02:15:45,640

4215
02:15:45,660 --> 02:15:46,940
Oh shit.

4216
02:15:47,420 --> 02:15:49,260
I was looking at the other guy.

4217
02:15:49,280 --> 02:15:49,380
She gets self -revive.

4218
02:15:50,280 --> 02:15:51,200
It's her self-revive.

4219
02:15:51,280 --> 02:15:51,420
No I'm flying.

4220
02:15:52,400 --> 02:15:53,400
Fushia has a self-revive.

4221
02:15:53,480 --> 02:15:54,560
You have to double tap her.

4222
02:15:54,920 --> 02:15:56,400
Is that a passive or is it like...

4223
02:15:57,940 --> 02:16:00,200
I got two guys above me coming from behind.

4224
02:16:00,340 --> 02:16:01,800
One guy in front of me coming from the front.

4225
02:16:02,040 --> 02:16:02,740
It's not her ult?

4226
02:16:02,740 --> 02:16:03,680
Oh wait.

4227
02:16:03,700 --> 02:16:04,540
I think it is a passive.

4228
02:16:04,660 --> 02:16:05,080
I'm not sure.

4229
02:16:05,240 --> 02:16:05,860
Two guys in front of me.

4230
02:16:06,180 --> 02:16:06,880
Fuck I'm dead.

4231
02:16:08,080 --> 02:16:08,960
They're defusing.

4232
02:16:10,420 --> 02:16:11,240
They're defusing.

4233
02:16:11,580 --> 02:16:12,200
They're defusing.

4234
02:16:14,520 --> 02:16:14,960
Oh.

4235
02:16:16,120 --> 02:16:17,800
Did they... Oh they defused.

4236
02:16:17,840 --> 02:16:19,340
Guys we need to stop.

4237
02:16:19,360 --> 02:16:20,800
We need to stop fucking running guys.

4238
02:16:20,800 --> 02:16:22,320
Guys we need to stop this.

4239
02:16:22,320 --> 02:16:23,900
This is a defense map you know.

4240
02:16:23,920 --> 02:16:25,960
Stop this three middle bullshit.

4241
02:16:26,320 --> 02:16:28,020
Go three B two middle.

4242
02:16:28,340 --> 02:16:28,820
I'm helping.

4243
02:16:28,840 --> 02:16:29,680
Four B long.

4244
02:16:29,740 --> 02:16:30,600
Four B long.

4245
02:16:30,760 --> 02:16:31,000
Okay.

4246
02:16:31,140 --> 02:16:31,980
B is free.

4247
02:16:32,740 --> 02:16:33,020
Okay.

4248
02:16:33,080 --> 02:16:34,740
I'm going to RPR.

4249
02:16:35,220 --> 02:16:41,680
One of our biggest problems as a team is some of you just jerk off in mid lane for no reason.

4250
02:16:42,360 --> 02:16:43,420
What I'm covering.

4251
02:16:44,780 --> 02:16:45,220
Wait.

4252
02:16:45,240 --> 02:16:45,820
Mid lane bad?

4253
02:16:46,060 --> 02:16:47,040
Who are you covering?

4254
02:16:47,320 --> 02:16:47,840
Bomb site?

4255
02:16:47,960 --> 02:16:48,540
We on tech.

4256
02:16:49,240 --> 02:16:50,840
You just think you always deal in mid.

4257
02:16:50,920 --> 02:16:52,000
Just like bait them you know.

4258
02:16:52,280 --> 02:16:52,780
Oh okay.

4259
02:16:52,820 --> 02:16:53,460
I'll bait them.

4260
02:16:53,560 --> 02:16:53,760
Yeah.

4261
02:16:53,900 --> 02:16:54,380
Throw a grenade.

4262
02:16:55,760 --> 02:16:59,500
I can literally cut off the entire half of the B site.

4263
02:16:59,840 --> 02:17:01,080
Yeah we plant for free.

4264
02:17:01,120 --> 02:17:01,680
Plant for free.

4265
02:17:02,740 --> 02:17:03,320
Then we play tight.

4266
02:17:04,460 --> 02:17:04,820
Smart.

4267
02:17:06,320 --> 02:17:06,960
Doesn't matter.

4268
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:07,320
Go up.

4269
02:17:08,940 --> 02:17:09,520
We're behind.

4270
02:17:09,760 --> 02:17:10,180
Oh my god.

4271
02:17:10,180 --> 02:17:11,080
All three are mid.

4272
02:17:11,220 --> 02:17:11,700
All three mid.

4273
02:17:11,740 --> 02:17:12,120
All three mid.

4274
02:17:12,940 --> 02:17:13,660
I'm planting.

4275
02:17:13,880 --> 02:17:14,980
I had to cover two angles.

4276
02:17:14,980 --> 02:17:15,380
There's a guy here.

4277
02:17:15,620 --> 02:17:16,220
Guy in pink.

4278
02:17:19,360 --> 02:17:19,720
No.

4279
02:17:19,940 --> 02:17:20,640
No I fucked up.

4280
02:17:20,800 --> 02:17:21,020
Behind.

4281
02:17:21,120 --> 02:17:21,200
Behind.

4282
02:17:21,300 --> 02:17:21,760
Where we came from?

4283
02:17:22,740 --> 02:17:24,240
They were all spreading mid.

4284
02:17:24,280 --> 02:17:24,640
Help.

4285
02:17:24,880 --> 02:17:25,080
Help.

4286
02:17:25,200 --> 02:17:25,400
Help.

4287
02:17:25,480 --> 02:17:25,580
Help.

4288
02:17:25,880 --> 02:17:26,240
No.

4289
02:17:27,200 --> 02:17:28,080
I got one.

4290
02:17:28,140 --> 02:17:28,560
I'm Qing you.

4291
02:17:29,780 --> 02:17:30,500
Oh no.

4292
02:17:31,360 --> 02:17:33,320
How did you hit that you cheater?

4293
02:17:34,480 --> 02:17:35,200
You cheater.

4294
02:17:37,220 --> 02:17:37,680
I'm Qing you.

4295
02:17:37,680 --> 02:17:37,900
Bruh.

4296
02:17:39,080 --> 02:17:40,140
I think we need a new strat.

4297
02:17:40,320 --> 02:17:41,640
I don't think we should go B and E.

4298
02:17:42,460 --> 02:17:43,260
No no no.

4299
02:17:43,320 --> 02:17:44,820
So once we get the bomb though.

4300
02:17:44,860 --> 02:17:46,080
We just have to play defensively.

4301
02:17:46,100 --> 02:17:47,020
Once they're all around the bomb.

4302
02:17:47,240 --> 02:17:48,120
We literally just.

4303
02:17:48,440 --> 02:17:49,400
You know.

4304
02:17:53,020 --> 02:17:53,760
I'm just saying.

4305
02:17:54,020 --> 02:17:55,480
B long was free.

4306
02:17:55,540 --> 02:17:55,900
Switching.

4307
02:17:56,900 --> 02:17:58,620
Okay now I'm playing this lady.

4308
02:17:59,040 --> 02:17:59,520
Shit.

4309
02:18:00,480 --> 02:18:01,540
Guys this is very good.

4310
02:18:01,860 --> 02:18:02,580
I'm throwing.

4311
02:18:04,040 --> 02:18:05,240
Guys guys guys.

4312
02:18:05,460 --> 02:18:07,280
Believe in the vision guys.

4313
02:18:07,360 --> 02:18:07,740
Right here.

4314
02:18:08,200 --> 02:18:08,880
Oh she's playing.

4315
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:09,360
Oh wait.

4316
02:18:09,380 --> 02:18:11,200
Sure you can rez people with your abilities.

4317
02:18:11,920 --> 02:18:13,360
Yeah but I have sniper rifle.

4318
02:18:14,660 --> 02:18:15,900
Believe in the vision guys.

4319
02:18:16,120 --> 02:18:17,520
I'm playing a male character.

4320
02:18:17,840 --> 02:18:18,760
Believe in the vision.

4321
02:18:19,020 --> 02:18:19,560
Oh no.

4322
02:18:19,860 --> 02:18:20,880
He has a dick.

4323
02:18:22,260 --> 02:18:23,680
Wait I thought we were trying.

4324
02:18:23,980 --> 02:18:24,840
What happened?

4325
02:18:25,900 --> 02:18:27,500
Don't worry this guy is goaded.

4326
02:18:28,120 --> 02:18:30,280
I thought we were trying.

4327
02:18:31,140 --> 02:18:32,320
Yeah we are trying.

4328
02:18:32,760 --> 02:18:33,000
This is.

4329
02:18:33,100 --> 02:18:34,080
I'm doing this for us.

4330
02:18:36,060 --> 02:18:37,800
Chad which is better this one or this one?

4331
02:18:37,940 --> 02:18:38,820
I'm going to go B.

4332
02:18:39,260 --> 02:18:41,780
I've never played this map so I don't know where to put my turrets.

4333
02:18:43,460 --> 02:18:44,620
We just attacked.

4334
02:18:44,720 --> 02:18:45,780
You know where we come from.

4335
02:18:46,320 --> 02:18:47,060
Yeah but.

4336
02:18:47,320 --> 02:18:48,020
Not really.

4337
02:18:50,040 --> 02:18:51,360
I don't remember.

4338
02:18:52,120 --> 02:18:52,940
I guess I could.

4339
02:18:53,120 --> 02:18:53,700
It's right here.

4340
02:18:54,440 --> 02:18:54,840
Probably.

4341
02:18:55,900 --> 02:18:57,160
I'm trying to figure out where they come from.

4342
02:18:57,300 --> 02:18:57,920
I got professionals in chat.

4343
02:18:58,120 --> 02:19:00,780
I am holding.

4344
02:19:00,840 --> 02:19:02,080
I am holding midel.

4345
02:19:02,200 --> 02:19:03,420
Someone needs to hold A.

4346
02:19:03,680 --> 02:19:05,140
Yeah someone needs to hold A.

4347
02:19:05,460 --> 02:19:06,820
I'm trying to figure out where to put turrets.

4348
02:19:07,460 --> 02:19:09,200
I'm close quarter combat only.

4349
02:19:12,080 --> 02:19:14,660
I guess I could put a turret on the site.

4350
02:19:14,940 --> 02:19:14,980
I guess I could put a turret on the site.

4351
02:19:14,980 --> 02:19:15,480
Pushing me hard.

4352
02:19:15,560 --> 02:19:16,220
I don't see A.

4353
02:19:16,840 --> 02:19:19,740
I'm going behind him.

4354
02:19:20,580 --> 02:19:21,740
Guys I forgot to get the nades.

4355
02:19:21,820 --> 02:19:23,060
I was so confused.

4356
02:19:23,060 --> 02:19:24,360
I'm a VTuber right now.

4357
02:19:24,380 --> 02:19:24,720
What behind?

4358
02:19:24,980 --> 02:19:25,520
I'm blind.

4359
02:19:25,960 --> 02:19:27,320
They smoked us.

4360
02:19:28,480 --> 02:19:29,780
I'm going to drop to the ground.

4361
02:19:32,960 --> 02:19:34,600
They are top left mid.

4362
02:19:34,720 --> 02:19:35,220
Top left mid.

4363
02:19:37,260 --> 02:19:38,220
On me.

4364
02:19:38,320 --> 02:19:40,220
Can I heal myself?

4365
02:19:41,140 --> 02:19:41,860
I'm fucked.

4366
02:19:42,020 --> 02:19:42,200
I'm fucked.

4367
02:19:42,380 --> 02:19:44,500
They are so deep into A.

4368
02:19:45,220 --> 02:19:46,060
I'm heading over.

4369
02:19:47,600 --> 02:19:48,480
Planted the bomb.

4370
02:19:49,600 --> 02:19:50,660
I don't know where they are.

4371
02:19:51,780 --> 02:19:52,640
They are all...

4372
02:19:52,640 --> 02:19:53,480
Can you speak?

4373
02:19:54,160 --> 02:19:55,040
I am...

4374
02:19:56,500 --> 02:19:57,960
I'm going to come over.

4375
02:19:58,080 --> 02:19:59,120
I got my two.

4376
02:20:00,020 --> 02:20:00,540
Did you thirst?

4377
02:20:00,800 --> 02:20:02,380
I thirsted one.

4378
02:20:03,660 --> 02:20:04,540
Oh no.

4379
02:20:06,180 --> 02:20:07,600
I thirsted one of your kills.

4380
02:20:07,760 --> 02:20:08,700
It's a 3v2.

4381
02:20:09,340 --> 02:20:10,320
I got one as well.

4382
02:20:10,980 --> 02:20:11,620
Oh my god.

4383
02:20:14,100 --> 02:20:16,320
He is going to rest over here.

4384
02:20:16,520 --> 02:20:17,520
Yeah but the bomb though.

4385
02:20:18,300 --> 02:20:18,740
Yeah.

4386
02:20:20,660 --> 02:20:21,280
He has this.

4387
02:20:22,060 --> 02:20:23,060
I don't know where they are.

4388
02:20:24,660 --> 02:20:25,880
He is leaving.

4389
02:20:27,300 --> 02:20:27,780
Goodbye.

4390
02:20:29,280 --> 02:20:30,480
I saw that.

4391
02:20:30,580 --> 02:20:31,260
I'm like goodbye.

4392
02:20:33,280 --> 02:20:34,140
It's okay guys.

4393
02:20:34,220 --> 02:20:34,760
We got this.

4394
02:20:37,640 --> 02:20:39,740
I need to know where to put my turrets.

4395
02:20:41,040 --> 02:20:41,700
Let's see.

4396
02:20:44,580 --> 02:20:46,320
You will not kill my allies.

4397
02:20:46,860 --> 02:20:48,960
Guys I cannot play A or B.

4398
02:20:49,040 --> 02:20:49,860
I can only play mid.

4399
02:20:51,320 --> 02:20:53,040
I'm putting turrets on the site.

4400
02:20:54,200 --> 02:20:55,460
And I will put it over here.

4401
02:20:55,900 --> 02:20:57,160
I go B I guess.

4402
02:20:57,660 --> 02:20:58,240
I'm B.

4403
02:20:59,100 --> 02:20:59,900
Right now.

4404
02:21:01,280 --> 02:21:03,760
We can play off the B side.

4405
02:21:03,880 --> 02:21:04,900
We don't have to be on the B side.

4406
02:21:04,980 --> 02:21:06,680
As long as we have mid we can retake B.

4407
02:21:07,260 --> 02:21:10,980
I'm trying to figure out how to defend.

4408
02:21:10,980 --> 02:21:11,540
They are fucking smoking me in mid.

4409
02:21:11,600 --> 02:21:12,720
They are wall hacking me.

4410
02:21:12,860 --> 02:21:13,260
And they are cheating.

4411
02:21:14,120 --> 02:21:14,840
It's not B.

4412
02:21:16,640 --> 02:21:17,100
It's A.

4413
02:21:17,100 --> 02:21:19,080
They are going mid.

4414
02:21:19,680 --> 02:21:20,220
I'm going.

4415
02:21:23,200 --> 02:21:23,860
I'm rotating.

4416
02:21:25,740 --> 02:21:27,280
They are rotating back to B.

4417
02:21:27,500 --> 02:21:27,940
Mid.

4418
02:21:28,180 --> 02:21:28,840
They are coming mid.

4419
02:21:29,580 --> 02:21:30,880
We got a crossfire.

4420
02:21:30,960 --> 02:21:31,360
No we don't.

4421
02:21:31,400 --> 02:21:31,740
I'm smoked.

4422
02:21:34,260 --> 02:21:35,640
They rushed me too.

4423
02:21:36,380 --> 02:21:37,540
I'm looking from here.

4424
02:21:39,620 --> 02:21:40,760
There are two over there.

4425
02:21:43,020 --> 02:21:44,680
They used an ability on me.

4426
02:21:44,680 --> 02:21:44,920
I'm slowed.

4427
02:21:46,860 --> 02:21:47,760
I might need help.

4428
02:21:47,800 --> 02:21:49,320
Who the fuck is your cops coming?

4429
02:21:49,580 --> 02:21:50,300
My bad.

4430
02:21:50,580 --> 02:21:53,180
Guys they are calling an ambulance.

4431
02:21:53,520 --> 02:21:54,240
But not for me.

4432
02:21:55,860 --> 02:21:56,680
I'm pushing up.

4433
02:21:57,740 --> 02:21:59,260
I can look from the flank here.

4434
02:22:02,260 --> 02:22:02,760
I got one.

4435
02:22:05,620 --> 02:22:06,020
Nice.

4436
02:22:09,260 --> 02:22:10,180
I got him.

4437
02:22:10,360 --> 02:22:11,060
I got trade.

4438
02:22:13,240 --> 02:22:13,640
Here.

4439
02:22:13,640 --> 02:22:14,300
That's the last guy.

4440
02:22:14,920 --> 02:22:16,620
I'm gonna try and get Doki up.

4441
02:22:16,900 --> 02:22:18,320
Yeah he's pushing me away.

4442
02:22:18,600 --> 02:22:19,260
Fucking stop.

4443
02:22:19,840 --> 02:22:20,780
Leave me alone.

4444
02:22:22,560 --> 02:22:24,760
That guy was pushing me back.

4445
02:22:25,760 --> 02:22:26,560
He's killing me.

4446
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:27,940
I can hit him later.

4447
02:22:28,060 --> 02:22:29,060
I got you in this corner.

4448
02:22:30,300 --> 02:22:30,880
He's alone.

4449
02:22:31,060 --> 02:22:31,720
Just push him.

4450
02:22:32,800 --> 02:22:33,560
It's only him.

4451
02:22:34,400 --> 02:22:35,260
He's one height up.

4452
02:22:35,940 --> 02:22:36,420
Go.

4453
02:22:37,040 --> 02:22:37,800
He's in the corner.

4454
02:22:38,340 --> 02:22:39,020
I'm going.

4455
02:22:40,620 --> 02:22:41,420
He's nearly won.

4456
02:22:42,300 --> 02:22:43,180
Come on.

4457
02:22:43,260 --> 02:22:43,600
There.

4458
02:22:44,920 --> 02:22:45,580
Sniper rifle.

4459
02:22:45,800 --> 02:22:46,820
I have sniper rifle.

4460
02:22:48,540 --> 02:22:49,840
I have sniper rifle.

4461
02:22:50,220 --> 02:22:50,220
Wait.

4462
02:22:50,640 --> 02:22:51,940
What nade did you have?

4463
02:22:52,600 --> 02:22:53,900
I didn't have any nades.

4464
02:22:55,360 --> 02:22:56,340
I used them.

4465
02:22:56,700 --> 02:22:56,780
Oh.

4466
02:22:56,940 --> 02:22:57,220
Okay.

4467
02:22:57,840 --> 02:22:59,460
Guys this is way too close.

4468
02:22:59,800 --> 02:23:00,200
Hey.

4469
02:23:02,440 --> 02:23:03,260
Start stealing.

4470
02:23:03,580 --> 02:23:04,580
Listen to me.

4471
02:23:04,640 --> 02:23:06,220
Actually just leave B site.

4472
02:23:06,420 --> 02:23:07,480
Don't even play up there.

4473
02:23:07,640 --> 02:23:08,840
Play three in mid.

4474
02:23:09,040 --> 02:23:10,620
And then if they take B we can retake.

4475
02:23:10,680 --> 02:23:11,860
It's so easy to retake this stupid site.

4476
02:23:11,860 --> 02:23:13,800
I'm putting turrets up for us.

4477
02:23:13,880 --> 02:23:14,240
Just in case.

4478
02:23:15,480 --> 02:23:17,100
Play mid towards A.

4479
02:23:17,220 --> 02:23:18,960
I feel like A is way harder to retake.

4480
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:20,960
I'm gonna play on the side behind here.

4481
02:23:24,580 --> 02:23:27,480
So if you run here next I can back you up.

4482
02:23:29,260 --> 02:23:30,420
They're coming by Fushia.

4483
02:23:32,100 --> 02:23:33,800
They're coming in the left mid.

4484
02:23:34,240 --> 02:23:35,340
Whatever the fuck that is.

4485
02:23:40,060 --> 02:23:43,680
I don't even know if I'm in a good spot when it comes to...

4486
02:23:43,680 --> 02:23:44,160
I don't even know if I'm in a good spot when it comes to...

4487
02:23:44,780 --> 02:23:45,400
I'm blind!

4488
02:23:47,920 --> 02:23:48,780
They're not mid yet.

4489
02:23:48,940 --> 02:23:49,480
I'm looking.

4490
02:23:49,740 --> 02:23:50,380
I'm looking too.

4491
02:23:51,340 --> 02:23:53,060
I have wallhack in five.

4492
02:23:53,900 --> 02:23:54,300
AA.

4493
02:23:54,300 --> 02:23:55,620
There's one on A site somehow.

4494
02:23:56,560 --> 02:23:57,160
Heading over.

4495
02:23:57,920 --> 02:23:59,180
I see two on A.

4496
02:23:59,340 --> 02:23:59,740
Okay.

4497
02:23:59,740 --> 02:24:00,220
No one mid.

4498
02:24:00,240 --> 02:24:00,700
No one mid.

4499
02:24:01,800 --> 02:24:02,220
It's clear.

4500
02:24:03,440 --> 02:24:04,260
I'm heading over.

4501
02:24:05,160 --> 02:24:05,920
I need helping.

4502
02:24:06,800 --> 02:24:07,240
I'm here.

4503
02:24:07,320 --> 02:24:07,460
I'm here.

4504
02:24:08,820 --> 02:24:09,980
That guy was one.

4505
02:24:10,040 --> 02:24:11,940
Oh there's a guy to my left here.

4506
02:24:14,360 --> 02:24:15,380
I know I'm trying to...

4507
02:24:16,740 --> 02:24:17,420
He's 97.

4508
02:24:20,300 --> 02:24:20,780
Cracked him.

4509
02:24:22,980 --> 02:24:24,060
Guy planting is cracked.

4510
02:24:24,740 --> 02:24:25,820
I cracked another guy.

4511
02:24:26,040 --> 02:24:26,560
There's one.

4512
02:24:26,740 --> 02:24:26,960
There's one.

4513
02:24:27,040 --> 02:24:27,960
One dead.

4514
02:24:28,060 --> 02:24:28,280
One dead.

4515
02:24:29,440 --> 02:24:31,040
I don't know where the others are.

4516
02:24:32,880 --> 02:24:34,400
He's down there in front of me.

4517
02:24:34,460 --> 02:24:35,020
I don't know how to ping him.

4518
02:24:36,780 --> 02:24:37,740
He's right in front of me.

4519
02:24:38,080 --> 02:24:39,000
One HP right here.

4520
02:24:40,280 --> 02:24:41,000
Got him.

4521
02:24:41,280 --> 02:24:41,640
Nice.

4522
02:24:41,700 --> 02:24:41,960
Nice.

4523
02:24:42,200 --> 02:24:42,420
Nice.

4524
02:24:44,160 --> 02:24:44,460
Defended.

4525
02:24:45,180 --> 02:24:45,980
We're doing it.

4526
02:24:46,020 --> 02:24:46,340
We're doing it.

4527
02:24:46,660 --> 02:24:48,100
Don't get overconfident though.

4528
02:24:48,140 --> 02:24:48,420
Please.

4529
02:24:49,920 --> 02:24:51,200
Overconfident is a slow but insidious killer.

4530
02:24:51,200 --> 02:24:53,500
Every time we get overconfident we fuck out.

4531
02:24:54,140 --> 02:24:55,520
Just play like we did.

4532
02:24:57,840 --> 02:24:59,460
I'm heading over to...

4533
02:25:00,160 --> 02:25:01,380
that mob turrets.

4534
02:25:03,080 --> 02:25:04,460
I'm just gonna put it here.

4535
02:25:08,480 --> 02:25:09,360
I have...

4536
02:25:09,360 --> 02:25:12,160
I have my ult for retake.

4537
02:25:12,160 --> 02:25:13,060
If we need to use it.

4538
02:25:16,260 --> 02:25:17,320
I have...

4539
02:25:17,320 --> 02:25:17,700
I have...

4540
02:25:17,700 --> 02:25:19,180
Heroes never die.

4541
02:25:19,940 --> 02:25:21,360
Heroes never die.

4542
02:25:24,120 --> 02:25:25,560
Wait so you're on Mercy.

4543
02:25:26,480 --> 02:25:27,920
Surefire is on Mercy player.

4544
02:25:28,540 --> 02:25:29,040
No.

4545
02:25:29,260 --> 02:25:31,180
No one is being my kitten.

4546
02:25:32,500 --> 02:25:34,280
They're also... they're over here too.

4547
02:25:36,980 --> 02:25:37,980
Look at this next.

4548
02:25:39,380 --> 02:25:39,980
Wait.

4549
02:25:40,040 --> 02:25:40,160
Wait.

4550
02:25:40,240 --> 02:25:40,620
Behind.

4551
02:25:40,680 --> 02:25:40,940
Behind.

4552
02:25:40,940 --> 02:25:41,160
Behind.

4553
02:25:41,160 --> 02:25:41,160
Behind.

4554
02:25:42,540 --> 02:25:42,860
Behind.

4555
02:25:43,000 --> 02:25:43,000
Behind.

4556
02:25:43,000 --> 02:25:43,080
Oh fuck.

4557
02:25:43,100 --> 02:25:43,480
Next one.

4558
02:25:43,480 --> 02:25:44,020
They're right here.

4559
02:25:44,080 --> 02:25:44,400
They're right here.

4560
02:25:44,400 --> 02:25:45,020
On your right.

4561
02:25:45,060 --> 02:25:45,360
On your right.

4562
02:25:45,400 --> 02:25:45,740
Up here.

4563
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:46,320
Fuck.

4564
02:25:49,360 --> 02:25:51,000
Maybe I should have went forward instead of backwards.

4565
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:52,920
They're all heading down.

4566
02:25:53,000 --> 02:25:53,400
They're all heading down.

4567
02:25:54,120 --> 02:25:54,900
It's B guys.

4568
02:25:55,000 --> 02:25:55,160
B.

4569
02:25:56,060 --> 02:25:56,380
Oh.

4570
02:25:56,520 --> 02:25:57,200
They ulted B.

4571
02:25:57,200 --> 02:25:58,040
They ulted B.

4572
02:25:58,620 --> 02:26:00,340
I'm putting my turret down but I don't know if it's working.

4573
02:26:02,020 --> 02:26:02,860
I can't see.

4574
02:26:04,220 --> 02:26:04,920
Next is crazy.

4575
02:26:05,700 --> 02:26:06,140
On me.

4576
02:26:06,220 --> 02:26:06,360
On me.

4577
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:07,600
They ulted.

4578
02:26:07,600 --> 02:26:08,240
They ulted on my side.

4579
02:26:08,240 --> 02:26:08,820
They ulted my side.

4580
02:26:12,500 --> 02:26:13,120
Oh I got him.

4581
02:26:13,160 --> 02:26:13,720
Yes Doki.

4582
02:26:13,800 --> 02:26:14,020
Yes.

4583
02:26:14,280 --> 02:26:14,580
No.

4584
02:26:14,580 --> 02:26:14,980
They see.

4585
02:26:15,120 --> 02:26:15,280
They see.

4586
02:26:15,320 --> 02:26:15,780
They see.

4587
02:26:16,140 --> 02:26:17,380
One more on Doki's body.

4588
02:26:18,340 --> 02:26:18,880
They're resing.

4589
02:26:18,940 --> 02:26:19,180
They're resing.

I want to suck your blood.

4643
02:27:22,580 --> 02:27:23,980
Where did that come from?

4644
02:27:25,160 --> 02:27:27,340
He's gonna like kill Dracula for a second.

4645
02:27:27,620 --> 02:27:27,640
He's gonna like kill Dracula for a second.

4647
02:27:35,020 --> 02:27:35,500
Yeah.

4648
02:27:35,540 --> 02:27:36,600
There's only one to the left.

4649
02:27:36,680 --> 02:27:37,840
They're pushing like mega ult.

4650
02:27:37,920 --> 02:27:38,220
There's only one to the left.

4651
02:27:38,220 --> 02:27:38,220
They're pushing like mega ult.

4652
02:27:38,240 --> 02:27:38,680
There's another one.

4653
02:27:39,060 --> 02:27:39,380

There's two.

4656
02:27:40,900 --> 02:27:41,740
There's four of them.

4657
02:27:41,800 --> 02:27:42,280
There's four of them.

4658
02:27:42,280 --> 02:27:42,520
We're good.

4659
02:27:42,580 --> 02:27:42,740
We're good.

4660
02:27:42,740 --> 02:27:42,820
We're good.

4661
02:27:42,820 --> 02:27:45,220
Dex, you should not be sacrificing your life.

4662
02:27:45,320 --> 02:27:46,560
You do not have Phoenix ult.

4663
02:27:46,680 --> 02:27:46,900
Yeah.

4664
02:27:48,800 --> 02:27:49,740
I Phoenix ulted.

4665
02:27:50,200 --> 02:27:50,520
Wait.

4666
02:27:50,680 --> 02:27:51,380
There's someone on me.

4667
02:27:51,420 --> 02:27:52,120
There's someone on my Alita.

4668
02:27:52,400 --> 02:27:52,720
Help.

4669
02:27:53,100 --> 02:27:54,200
They pushed the far side.

4670
02:27:54,960 --> 02:27:55,380
I'm with you.

4671
02:27:55,400 --> 02:27:55,620
I'm with you.

4672
02:27:56,000 --> 02:27:56,680
That is true.

4673
02:27:57,060 --> 02:27:57,900
He's not lying.

4674
02:27:59,140 --> 02:27:59,900
They're body shot.

4675
02:28:00,040 --> 02:28:00,300
They're one.

4676
02:28:01,420 --> 02:28:01,860
Got him.

4677
02:28:01,860 --> 02:28:02,020
Got him.

4678
02:28:02,080 --> 02:28:02,700
I'm gonna stay here.

4679
02:28:02,800 --> 02:28:03,760
I'm anchoring B.

4680
02:28:03,800 --> 02:28:04,260
I'm anchoring B.

4681
02:28:04,300 --> 02:28:04,780
Just in case.

4682
02:28:05,580 --> 02:28:06,480
We left mid.

4683
02:28:06,680 --> 02:28:08,460
So she's dead on B in three seconds.

4684
02:28:08,620 --> 02:28:09,320
No, I'm not.

4685
02:28:09,400 --> 02:28:09,960
I'm still alive.

4686
02:28:11,180 --> 02:28:12,200
I can heal you next.

4687
02:28:13,040 --> 02:28:13,920
Where are you?

4688
02:28:14,640 --> 02:28:15,600
There's nobody in B.

4689
02:28:15,680 --> 02:28:16,420
There's nobody in B yet.

4690
02:28:17,080 --> 02:28:18,040
My turrets are...

4691
02:28:18,040 --> 02:28:19,600
They got top mid.

4692
02:28:19,860 --> 02:28:21,200
Leave it if you have to.

4693
02:28:24,360 --> 02:28:26,040
I got the opportune spot.

4694
02:28:26,360 --> 02:28:27,020
There's a sniper.

4695
02:28:27,020 --> 02:28:28,200
There's a sniper on the B.

4696
02:28:28,260 --> 02:28:28,800
Let them go.

4697
02:28:28,820 --> 02:28:29,380
Let them come in.

4698
02:28:29,440 --> 02:28:29,800
Let them come in.

4699
02:28:29,880 --> 02:28:31,040
They're all coming to me.

4700
02:28:31,080 --> 02:28:31,660
They're all coming to me.

4701
02:28:32,060 --> 02:28:32,420
Okay.

4702
02:28:33,020 --> 02:28:33,560
Pull back.

4703
02:28:33,640 --> 02:28:33,900
Pull back.

4704
02:28:34,100 --> 02:28:34,700
Play DV.

4705
02:28:34,780 --> 02:28:35,120
Defense.

4706
02:28:35,120 --> 02:28:35,340
Defense.

4707
02:28:35,720 --> 02:28:36,460
They're coming up.

4708
02:28:36,480 --> 02:28:36,980
They're coming up.

4709
02:28:37,900 --> 02:28:39,080
Two guys top right.

4710
02:28:39,140 --> 02:28:39,860
Two guys top right.

4711
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:42,120
Fuck is this guy shooting at?

4712
02:28:42,480 --> 02:28:43,120
Wall hacker.

4713
02:28:43,900 --> 02:28:44,960
Are they rotating?

4714
02:28:45,040 --> 02:28:45,520
Are they staying there?

4715
02:28:45,520 --> 02:28:45,680
Yeah.

4716
02:28:45,800 --> 02:28:46,480
My turret.

4717
02:28:46,600 --> 02:28:46,700
Yeah.

4718
02:28:46,720 --> 02:28:47,080
They're here.

4719
02:28:47,640 --> 02:28:48,900
They're breaking turrets right now.

4720
02:28:48,960 --> 02:28:50,700
They are wall hacking me.

4721
02:28:52,140 --> 02:28:53,340
I hit one for 159.

4722
02:28:54,600 --> 02:28:55,140
I'm pushing the B.

4723
02:28:55,340 --> 02:28:56,300
I'm slowed.

4724
02:28:56,460 --> 02:28:56,720
I'm slowed.

4725
02:28:57,840 --> 02:28:58,740
They're pushing us here.

4726
02:28:58,900 --> 02:28:59,600
They went high ground.

4727
02:28:59,600 --> 02:29:00,120
One is up on me.

4728
02:29:00,120 --> 02:29:00,720
One is up on me.

4729
02:29:01,520 --> 02:29:02,760
If you peek me, I can heal you.

4730
02:29:03,320 --> 02:29:03,640
What?

4731
02:29:04,080 --> 02:29:04,740
To my right.

4732
02:29:04,740 --> 02:29:06,140
Guys, no one is holding right side.

4733
02:29:06,140 --> 02:29:06,520
I couldn't.

4734
02:29:06,540 --> 02:29:07,280
I had to back up.

4735
02:29:07,320 --> 02:29:07,840
I got one.

4736
02:29:07,860 --> 02:29:08,140
I got one.

4737
02:29:08,580 --> 02:29:09,320
But I'm knocked.

4738
02:29:09,360 --> 02:29:10,040
I got knocked too.

4739
02:29:11,340 --> 02:29:11,940
They might rest.

4740
02:29:12,140 --> 02:29:12,260
They might rest.

4741
02:29:12,440 --> 02:29:12,920
One point.

4742
02:29:13,060 --> 02:29:13,240
One point.

4743
02:29:13,240 --> 02:29:13,440
One point.

4744
02:29:14,120 --> 02:29:14,440
Fuck.

4745
02:29:15,740 --> 02:29:16,240
He's low.

4746
02:29:16,360 --> 02:29:16,780
It's fine.

4747
02:29:16,860 --> 02:29:17,340
I rest myself.

4748
02:29:17,880 --> 02:29:18,200
Playtime.

4749
02:29:18,500 --> 02:29:18,820
Playtime.

4750
02:29:18,860 --> 02:29:19,100
Playtime.

4751
02:29:21,660 --> 02:29:23,400
Dude, he's so fucking...

4752
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:27,100
Don't peek me, bitch.

4753
02:29:28,280 --> 02:29:29,440
No peeking.

4754
02:29:29,440 --> 02:29:30,660
No peeking me.

4755
02:29:38,330 --> 02:29:38,910
Alright.

4756
02:29:40,890 --> 02:29:42,750
There's issues in the brain.

4757
02:29:47,830 --> 02:29:50,470
Why do you play better when you speak Russian English?

4758
02:29:51,390 --> 02:29:52,370
What talking?

4759
02:29:52,750 --> 02:29:53,830
What talking about?

4760
02:29:55,450 --> 02:29:56,790
No peeking me.

4761
02:29:59,170 --> 02:29:59,910
You die!

4762
02:30:01,370 --> 02:30:01,970
Joke's over.

4763
02:30:02,150 --> 02:30:03,770
If you guys want to peek me, I can flash this.

4764
02:30:03,890 --> 02:30:05,050
I'm looking right now.

4765
02:30:08,710 --> 02:30:09,610
No one made it.

4766
02:30:09,770 --> 02:30:11,530
I have a feeling they're rushing me.

4767
02:30:11,710 --> 02:30:12,890
Yeah, no one made it.

4768
02:30:14,750 --> 02:30:15,830
I'm going behind.

4769
02:30:15,830 --> 02:30:16,710
He's in the visibility wall.

4770
02:30:17,810 --> 02:30:18,550
I'm heading over.

4771
02:30:19,830 --> 02:30:21,050
They're all in the LZ.

4772
02:30:21,470 --> 02:30:22,410
They're floating thing.

4773
02:30:22,930 --> 02:30:23,750
Oh yeah, they are.

4774
02:30:23,790 --> 02:30:24,190
They are across.

4775
02:30:24,670 --> 02:30:25,870
They got me wallhacking.

4776
02:30:25,870 --> 02:30:26,530
They're smoking me.

4777
02:30:26,570 --> 02:30:27,050
They're smoking.

4778
02:30:27,210 --> 02:30:27,350
What the fuck?

4779
02:30:27,570 --> 02:30:28,150
He's here.

4780
02:30:28,190 --> 02:30:28,450
He's here.

4781
02:30:28,470 --> 02:30:29,210
He's cheating wallhack.

4782
02:30:29,750 --> 02:30:30,550
On my body.

4783
02:30:30,630 --> 02:30:30,910
On my body.

4784
02:30:31,250 --> 02:30:32,890
Wait, wait.

4785
02:30:33,010 --> 02:30:33,150
No.

4786
02:30:33,810 --> 02:30:34,790
I don't see anybody.

4787
02:30:35,970 --> 02:30:36,690
Got one.

4788
02:30:36,770 --> 02:30:36,870
Got one.

4789
02:30:37,770 --> 02:30:38,490
We're not right now.

4790
02:30:38,590 --> 02:30:38,830
We're not right.

4791
02:30:39,110 --> 02:30:40,230
They smoked me.

4792
02:30:40,310 --> 02:30:40,690
They smoked me.

4793
02:30:40,910 --> 02:30:41,450
He's pushing.

4794
02:30:41,570 --> 02:30:41,810
He's pushing.

4795
02:30:41,950 --> 02:30:46,330
I don't know if I can help.

4796
02:30:46,370 --> 02:30:47,810
I knew they would push me like that.

4797
02:30:48,030 --> 02:30:48,930
Oh, I traded.

4798
02:30:49,030 --> 02:30:49,310
I traded.

4799
02:30:49,490 --> 02:30:49,870
I don't know.

4800
02:30:49,890 --> 02:30:50,750
It was not worth it though.

4801
02:30:51,050 --> 02:30:51,850
One v4.

4802
02:30:51,970 --> 02:30:52,350
One v4.

4803
02:30:53,050 --> 02:30:54,130
This is clutch.

4804
02:30:55,750 --> 02:30:56,710
Oh, not clutch.

4805
02:30:59,410 --> 02:31:00,430
Guys, lock in.

4806
02:31:00,550 --> 02:31:00,990
Lock in.

4807
02:31:01,170 --> 02:31:01,930
Guys, lock in.

4808
02:31:02,170 --> 02:31:03,130
We're trying.

4809
02:31:03,210 --> 02:31:04,650
We're trying our best.

4810
02:31:05,050 --> 02:31:06,610
They might push A now that they know that.

4811
02:31:06,610 --> 02:31:07,550
They're not going to do that again.

4812
02:31:08,350 --> 02:31:09,670
How do you ping in this game?

4813
02:31:09,810 --> 02:31:10,010
Z.

4814
02:31:10,110 --> 02:31:10,250
Z.

4815
02:31:10,790 --> 02:31:12,310
I mean you can re-bind it.

4816
02:31:12,670 --> 02:31:13,450
They fucking...

4817
02:31:13,450 --> 02:31:16,230
They take this fucking lift for free every time.

4818
02:31:16,250 --> 02:31:17,610
So I might just play right here.

4819
02:31:18,630 --> 02:31:20,250
But someone has to watch like mid-A.

4820
02:31:20,610 --> 02:31:21,030
If...

4821
02:31:21,810 --> 02:31:23,190
I'm watching here.

4822
02:31:23,790 --> 02:31:26,490
So if they are pushing, I'm going to look down.

4823
02:31:26,650 --> 02:31:27,530
But I have a shotgun.

4824
02:31:27,670 --> 02:31:27,910
So...

4825
02:31:28,470 --> 02:31:28,770
I can't do much.

4826
02:31:29,070 --> 02:31:29,470
But...

4827
02:31:31,510 --> 02:31:34,690
If they are pushing A, just like play that corner.

4828
02:31:35,010 --> 02:31:38,230
They might push A again because they realized it wasn't an easy take.

4829
02:31:39,310 --> 02:31:40,710
I don't see anyone mid.

4830
02:31:41,230 --> 02:31:41,870
Oh yeah, they are going A.

4831
02:31:42,750 --> 02:31:43,390
Going A.

4832
02:31:44,770 --> 02:31:46,070
There is one mid.

4833
02:31:47,110 --> 02:31:47,930
I've been spotted.

4834
02:31:48,370 --> 02:31:49,090
Fucking hell.

4835
02:31:50,130 --> 02:31:50,670
She's one.

4836
02:31:50,830 --> 02:31:51,390
I think she's...

4837
02:31:51,390 --> 02:31:51,950
Did I kill her?

4838
02:31:53,370 --> 02:31:54,370
There's two more.

4839
02:31:54,570 --> 02:31:54,870
There's two more.

4840
02:31:54,870 --> 02:31:55,290
I'm dead.

4841
02:31:56,270 --> 02:31:57,930
I can get revive, no?

4842
02:31:58,350 --> 02:31:58,950
No, no.

4843
02:31:58,970 --> 02:31:59,590
You're way too far.

4844
02:32:00,690 --> 02:32:02,650
He pushed out and ate me.

4845
02:32:03,810 --> 02:32:04,930
I'm looking right now.

4846
02:32:04,930 --> 02:32:05,290
I pinged for you.

4847
02:32:05,390 --> 02:32:06,230
One right here.

4848
02:32:06,890 --> 02:32:07,590
I see him.

4849
02:32:07,690 --> 02:32:07,810
I see him.

4850
02:32:08,230 --> 02:32:08,990
Yeah, yeah.

4851
02:32:08,990 --> 02:32:09,550
I see the rotate.

4852
02:32:09,790 --> 02:32:10,250
They are going back.

4853
02:32:12,670 --> 02:32:14,870
My turret is still there, so...

4854
02:32:19,910 --> 02:32:21,790
Yeah, they are going hard B.

4855
02:32:22,190 --> 02:32:22,810
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4856
02:32:23,490 --> 02:32:24,370
Careful, careful next.

4857
02:32:25,410 --> 02:32:26,890
I'm running for my life.

4858
02:32:27,090 --> 02:32:28,210
I think they are going B long.

4859
02:32:28,290 --> 02:32:28,570
Yeah, yeah.

4860
02:32:28,570 --> 02:32:28,890
All of them.

4861
02:32:30,610 --> 02:32:31,690
The sniper is looking at me.

4862
02:32:31,690 --> 02:32:31,770
One mid.

4863
02:32:32,150 --> 02:32:32,390
One mid.

4864
02:32:34,970 --> 02:32:35,910
I'm flashing them.

4865
02:32:36,170 --> 02:32:36,630
Careful next.

4866
02:32:37,990 --> 02:32:39,490
Oh, they smoked me.

4867
02:32:39,530 --> 02:32:41,330
They smoked me, so I can't see anymore.

4868
02:32:43,730 --> 02:32:44,370
I'm backing out.

4869
02:32:47,050 --> 02:32:48,530
They are going to go for a normal bomb plant.

4870
02:32:53,010 --> 02:32:53,650
Careful, careful.

4871
02:32:54,370 --> 02:32:54,850
Yeah, yeah.

4872
02:32:56,730 --> 02:32:58,610
They are going dirt.

4873
02:32:59,130 --> 02:32:59,710
They are planting.

4874
02:33:00,030 --> 02:33:00,430
Nice.

4875
02:33:00,530 --> 02:33:01,150
Bomb down.

4876
02:33:01,690 --> 02:33:02,730
I'm healing you, Doki.

4877
02:33:03,630 --> 02:33:04,470
Behind, behind.

4878
02:33:05,490 --> 02:33:06,510
Right here, right here.

4879
02:33:07,290 --> 02:33:08,610
There is one over here.

4880
02:33:08,710 --> 02:33:09,030
She is low.

4881
02:33:09,590 --> 02:33:10,190
She is so low.

4882
02:33:10,530 --> 02:33:11,670
On point as well.

4883
02:33:13,750 --> 02:33:15,390
That girl is low, but she has armor.

4884
02:33:15,590 --> 02:33:15,830
He is planting.

4885
02:33:16,630 --> 02:33:17,470
What is he doing?

4886
02:33:17,590 --> 02:33:18,110
He is bad.

4887
02:33:18,190 --> 02:33:18,930
He is bad at the video game.

4888
02:33:19,310 --> 02:33:19,730
Share power.

4889
02:33:19,970 --> 02:33:20,290
Share power.

4890
02:33:20,570 --> 02:33:21,250
Got them both.

4891
02:33:22,850 --> 02:33:23,250
Yeah!

4892
02:33:24,370 --> 02:33:25,870
What the fuck is happening?

4893
02:33:25,990 --> 02:33:26,870
What the fuck is happening?

4894
02:33:27,270 --> 02:33:30,210
I didn't realize my ult, I can just do it worldwide.

4895
02:33:30,370 --> 02:33:32,170
So I can rest Archer that whole time.

4896
02:33:32,850 --> 02:33:33,370
Nice.

4897
02:33:34,850 --> 02:33:35,370
Nice.

4898
02:33:35,690 --> 02:33:37,730
Did you even use your res?

4899
02:33:38,590 --> 02:33:39,110
No.

4900
02:33:39,870 --> 02:33:41,310
Guys, I think shotgun will...

4901
02:33:41,310 --> 02:33:43,130
Guys, 4000 damage.

4902
02:33:44,150 --> 02:33:45,190
Hey, 4500.

4903
02:33:45,610 --> 02:33:46,710
We broke 3k.

4904
02:33:47,490 --> 02:33:49,570
We broke 3k, guys.

4905
02:33:49,930 --> 02:33:52,890
I'm the only person in this team who has gotten an MVP.

4906
02:33:53,410 --> 02:33:54,030
I'm the only person in this team who has gotten an MVP.

4907
02:33:54,370 --> 02:33:54,470
What?

4908
02:33:54,470 --> 02:33:55,130
No, I got the...

4909
02:33:55,130 --> 02:33:59,010
You got S, VP.

4910
02:33:59,670 --> 02:34:01,150
Shotgun guy was mistake.

4911
02:34:01,410 --> 02:34:02,430
Shotgun guy was mistake.

4912
02:34:03,010 --> 02:34:04,210
It's okay, we carried you.

4913
02:34:04,290 --> 02:34:04,790
That's okay.

4914
02:34:05,470 --> 02:34:06,670
Yeah, but I carried attack.

4915
02:34:06,930 --> 02:34:07,390
I carried attack.

4916
02:34:08,610 --> 02:34:09,710
We did it!

4917
02:34:09,750 --> 02:34:11,190
We won a game, guys!

4918
02:34:11,210 --> 02:34:11,650
We won a game.

4919
02:34:11,910 --> 02:34:12,730
We won a game.

4920
02:34:12,910 --> 02:34:14,270
Look at us!

4921
02:34:14,690 --> 02:34:15,870
Oh my god!

4922
02:34:16,270 --> 02:34:17,910
We are not that bad!

4923
02:34:19,250 --> 02:34:20,590
You guys have won.

4924
02:34:20,670 --> 02:34:21,190
Congratulations.

4925
02:34:21,190 --> 02:34:22,030
Yay!

4926
02:34:22,870 --> 02:34:23,650
Thank you!

4927
02:34:25,370 --> 02:34:25,850
Yeah!

4928
02:34:25,910 --> 02:34:28,510
I feel like this was like the battle of the mids.

4929
02:34:30,850 --> 02:34:32,310
I wish we were in group B.

4930
02:34:32,530 --> 02:34:34,210
We should have been in group B, guys.

4931
02:34:36,170 --> 02:34:37,930
It was the mid of the year.

4932
02:34:41,410 --> 02:34:43,330
Hey, 1W, I take it.

4933
02:34:43,930 --> 02:34:44,770
Yay, guys!

4934
02:34:44,950 --> 02:34:46,670
I'm proud of all of us.

4935
02:34:47,130 --> 02:34:49,410
We did not get stomped.

4936
02:34:51,750 --> 02:34:52,930
Except that one time.

4937
02:34:52,950 --> 02:34:55,150
No, we don't talk about that.

4938
02:34:55,270 --> 02:34:56,610
I was MVP of that game.

4939
02:34:57,350 --> 02:35:00,550
You want me to MVP of the game when you got stomped?

4940
02:35:01,670 --> 02:35:03,330
Which means I am most performing.

4941
02:35:05,530 --> 02:35:06,010
Alright.

4942
02:35:08,010 --> 02:35:08,650
GG's, guys.

4943
02:35:08,930 --> 02:35:10,630
I had a great time.

4944
02:35:10,930 --> 02:35:13,430
I have to go prep for my...

4945
02:35:13,430 --> 02:35:16,450
I have to go prep for my debut stuff.

4946
02:35:16,590 --> 02:35:17,750
I had a great time.

4947
02:35:18,250 --> 02:35:18,730
GG's.

4948
02:35:18,730 --> 02:35:19,810
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

4949
02:35:20,070 --> 02:35:21,450
When we do this again.

4950
02:35:23,270 --> 02:35:23,950
We win.

4951
02:35:24,590 --> 02:35:25,030
GG's.

4952
02:35:25,050 --> 02:35:27,330
Okay, we're not gonna win against that.

4953
02:35:27,390 --> 02:35:28,590
We win the tournament tomorrow.

4954
02:35:28,730 --> 02:35:29,850
The team with the 9-0.

4955
02:35:31,210 --> 02:35:32,270
We warmed up.

4956
02:35:33,910 --> 02:35:34,510
GG's, guys.

4957
02:35:34,730 --> 02:35:35,170
GG's.

4958
02:35:35,170 --> 02:35:35,510
Bye-bye.

4959
02:35:36,270 --> 02:35:37,410
Bye-bye, everyone.

4960
02:35:37,790 --> 02:35:39,190
Bye-bye, Adamin.

4961
02:35:39,850 --> 02:35:42,810
Alright, everybody.

4962
02:35:43,270 --> 02:35:46,590
Okay, I have like an hour and a half to fully prep for the model day.

4963
02:35:47,050 --> 02:35:47,710
Skinsuit day.

4964
02:35:47,790 --> 02:35:48,270
Oh my gosh.

4965
02:35:48,770 --> 02:35:49,810
Stranova is fucking me up.

4966
02:35:51,230 --> 02:35:51,950
Skinsuit debut.

4967
02:35:52,410 --> 02:35:52,990
My version!

4968
02:35:55,910 --> 02:35:57,550
Because I'm gonna be a model.

4969
02:35:57,690 --> 02:35:59,190
That's why I said model debut.

4970
02:36:01,110 --> 02:36:01,470
Anyway.

4971
02:36:01,890 --> 02:36:02,550
Anyway, guys.

4972
02:36:02,730 --> 02:36:04,370
I am going to go prep now.

4973
02:36:04,530 --> 02:36:06,350
We won our one game, chat.

4974
02:36:06,470 --> 02:36:08,230
We won one game out of three.

4975
02:36:08,330 --> 02:36:09,110
That's all that matters.

4976
02:36:09,230 --> 02:36:09,870
One out of three.

4977
02:36:10,150 --> 02:36:10,750
Anyway, guys.

4978
02:36:10,850 --> 02:36:12,190
I am going to head off now.

4979
02:36:12,250 --> 02:36:13,590
As always, everybody stay hydrated.

4980
02:36:13,810 --> 02:36:14,190
Pause to check.

4981
02:36:14,250 --> 02:36:15,610
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

4982
02:36:15,610 --> 02:36:17,710
And if you stay up for me, stay up a little longer.

4983
02:36:17,830 --> 02:36:19,890
Because I have the Skinsuit reveal in an hour and a half!

4984
02:36:20,170 --> 02:36:21,130
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

4985
02:36:21,810 --> 02:36:22,470
Bye, guys.

4986
02:36:22,970 --> 02:36:23,290
Bye!
