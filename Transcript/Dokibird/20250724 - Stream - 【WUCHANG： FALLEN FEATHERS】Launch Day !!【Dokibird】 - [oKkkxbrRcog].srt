00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:47,640
Hello!

2
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:49,280
Oh my god, what was the wrong one?

3
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:51,480
Whoops!

4
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:54,960
I picked the wrong one.

5
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,360
Oh, wow.

6
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,800
Is it because of the game?

7
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:59,860
Oh man, okay, give me a sec.

8
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,280
Is this still compiling shaders?

9
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:05,660
Okay, we're definitely going to adjust the settings for this later.

10
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:08,820
Okay, anyway.

11
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,820
Okay, when I tab out...

12
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:11,940
Okay, yeah, I'll adjust this later.

13
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,680
I have the game booted up, but...

14
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,080
The shadings have been compiled!

15
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,200
The shaders have been compiled.

16
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,660
But I want to be here because I just want to make, like, you know, rip a bandit up, make a quick statement again.

17
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,780
Because of, like, you know, it's crazy about so much stuff coming out and everything.

18
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:30,540
So for those who are wondering, I sort of... I did know.

19
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,880
I want everyone to go support Mint tomorrow as well because it will be her fifth year anniversary.

20
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,640
And she's been going through a lot.

21
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:43,640
I did know about that she got signed to be Shoujo for a while.

22
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:48,320
I think, like, around the time she got signed, I didn't know about it.

23
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:53,300
But I didn't pry too much details about, like, what was going on and everything.

24
00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:00,020
And, you know, I just let her tell me stuff, like, if she wanted to.

25
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,160
Or, like, you know, I try not to pry too much.

26
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:06,360
So I didn't know how bad it was.

27
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,420
Because I just knew, like, the surface level details.

28
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,160
And Mint and I were actually supposed to do something together.

29
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,840
We had, like, a project together.

30
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,480
But we pushed it back and tabled it.

31
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,540
It was, like, in planning stages.

32
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,400
Not like we, like, made stuff for it already or everything.

33
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,060
It was just planning stages and stuff.

34
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:28,200
But we pushed it back and tabled it.

35
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:31,640
Because she wanted to focus her energy on her debut for this year.

36
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,040
And I was, like...

37
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,580
And then, like, you know, months sort of passed.

38
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,340
And I was, like, oh, aren't you supposed to debut and be Shoujo?

39
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,740
And she was, like, yeah, but he got pushed back.

40
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,040
And I didn't know reasoning.

41
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,160
I didn't pry about it.

42
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:45,920
And I was just...

43
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,480
Back then, I was, like, oh, that's great.

44
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,020
More time to prepare, you know?

45
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,720
I was, like, oh, that's cool.

46
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:55,960
You get more time to prepare for your debut.

47
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:59,440
Like, yeah, because I didn't know what was going on.

48
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,940
I was, like, at least you get to have a better debut and everything.

49
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:03,620
Like,

50
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,380
you know, in hindsight.

51
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,400
Maybe I...

52
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,600
Now that I know, in hindsight.

53
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,380
Um, also, I just, uh...

54
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,860
Yeah, I was very clueless.

55
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,080
Um...

56
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:24,800
Um...

57
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,500
Uh...

58
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,460
But I didn't want to, like, address this situation...

59
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:32,540
This thing, because of, like, there were so many, like, rumors and stuff going around.

60
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,320
But for those who were wondering...

61
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,820
No, I was never approached about...

62
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:37,780
By B-Shojo.

63
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,600
I didn't realize how big the rabbit hole was.

64
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:47,300
And I'm finding out so much information at the same time as you guys right now.

65
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,080
And, um...

66
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,320
Uh, no VTuber company wanted me or, like, gave me an offer.

67
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,420
Or, like, approached me to help me after, you know, I got fired.

68
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,380
And got thrown into being indie.

69
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:05,520
Um, and I think, like, a lot of people forgot that, like...

70
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,760
I was basically, like, super taboo and radioactive.

71
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,180
And also controversial.

72
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,060
And I...

73
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,600
Uh, so, yeah.

74
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:14,500
No, I didn't...

75
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,160
I didn't get any offers.

76
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:19,200
There was no poaching when it comes to me.

77
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:20,900
Um...

78
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,080
So I just wanted...

79
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,900
Because I saw somebody be like, oh, it's the most...

80
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,280
I was like, well, that would be news for me.

81
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:30,400
Ha ha ha ha!

82
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,280
Um...

83
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,940
So I just want to say that in case there's, like, rumors that, like, wow, I can't believe...

84
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:38,820
He showed you I approached, you know, all of these people.

85
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,020
And I was like, no, no, not me.

86
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,080
I was not involved in anything.

87
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:44,540
Like...

88
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:44,980
Ha ha ha!

89
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,360
Ha ha ha!

90
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:47,300
Ha ha ha!

91
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:47,720
Ha ha ha!

92
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:47,800
Ha ha!

93
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:48,360
Ha ha!

94
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:48,580
Ha ha!

95
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:48,880
Ha ha!

96
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,180
Um...

97
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:49,920
Um...

98
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,600
And...

99
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,100
Okay, I'm sorry.

100
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,180
It makes you feel like I'm making this about myself.

101
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:59,520
But I just wanted people to know that I wasn't contacted by an agency or any agency to join them after, you know, I got fired.

102
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,280
But, like, you know, the past is the past.

103
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,460
I mostly moved on from it.

104
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,240
And, like, you know, we gotta focus on the current and help the people that need it now.

105
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:15,560
So, like, it did give me, like, PTSD and sort of reopened some memories and trauma.

106
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:19,440
So, like, I guess that's why I'm, like, reacting like this right now.

107
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,460
Ha ha ha!

108
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,220
Like, I'm all over the place emotionally, um, about it.

109
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:28,740
And, yeah, I know, uh, just when you guys...

110
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:31,900
Not even pre-indie was I approached.

111
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:35,360
Because I saw people were, like, oh, man, they contacted every...

112
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,880
Not, not, no, no.

113
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:37,960
There's...

114
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,360
I feel like there were some of us that wasn't...

115
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,380
Just so you guys know, some of us...

116
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,540
Oh, I don't know if all...

117
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:44,420
Maybe it was just me.

118
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:44,800
I don't know.

119
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,520
But I wasn't approached even pre-indie.

120
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,560
But now I'm, like, finding out...

121
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,400
I'm, like...

122
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,620
I'm, like, I found out, like, so many other people did.

123
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,920
And, you know, like, that gift was, like, you guys get paid?

124
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:56,780
Like, like...

125
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:57,840
Ha ha ha ha!

126
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,460
I was so...

127
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,120
Like, that's how I was, like...

128
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,760
I was, like, wait, you guys got poached?

129
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:03,700
Like...

130
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:04,400
Ha ha ha ha!

131
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,120
I was just, like...

132
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,200
So, like, that was mean...

133
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,060
Like, that was my...

134
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,140
Like, not my reaction.

135
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,420
But I was, like, just thinking about that gift when I found out.

136
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:17,180
Like, wait, how many people did they approach, like, pre-indie?

137
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,680
I was, like, so...

138
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,700
I was, like, wait, what?

139
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,540
Like, how many people got approached?

140
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:33,040
But please support those who were affected with the V Shoujo collapse.

141
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:44,540
I know the transition period would be very hard, especially being thrust into uncertainty and all the projects and things you were looking forward to just disappearing and stuff.

142
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:55,800
I had a few of the stuff in the works at that time that I would never see the light of day after countless hours and days and weeks working on them and I even had an injury to produce one of the things.

143
00:07:56,060 --> 00:08:00,060
So I understand the grief that they're going through.

144
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:10,560
And it's just really sad because no one deserves to experience that and I really hope they all find a place and are able to recover.

145
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,500
You know, my story is done.

146
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,560
Like, this is their story.

147
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:19,540
And we need to focus on the now and hearing their voice and all of this.

148
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:21,040
So yeah, like, please support everyone.

149
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:24,320
Like I said, Mint's anniversary is tomorrow.

150
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:29,120
And I hear the girls that, you know, they're supposed to debut right after Mint.

151
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,040
It was the monster girl.

152
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,600
Jen is also doing collabs.

153
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:40,220
So yeah, please support the previous talents and also the ones that, you know, came before them and the ones that were supposed to debut.

154
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,140
As well.

155
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,440
So yeah, support all of them.

156
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,660
Uh, they, uh, really need it during, like, this time.

157
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:55,720
So, uh, but yeah, um, um, I assume like, you know, like, uh, so hard to talk about this.

158
00:08:55,840 --> 00:09:02,780
It is like, you know, when I, like, I didn't do much work the last two days because it just, like, it just felt like deja vu.

159
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:05,160
Like looking at it as, I don't know.

160
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:07,000
I'm like looking at it in the sidelines.

161
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:12,280
I mean, like, I can't believe this is sort of like, you know, another VTuber Armageddon again.

162
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:17,020
And like, it's just, it's just so, I, I really feel for them.

163
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,700
Um, and like, oh my gosh.

164
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:25,200
When I was reading that statement about how, what's the word?

165
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:33,780
I was reading, like, a recount of, like, what, like, people were doing and stuff to pit people against each other and everything.

166
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:37,420
Like, that was like, oh my gosh.

167
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:40,260
That felt like deja vu.

168
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,920
I don't know if I can say deja vu.

169
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,940
But like, I felt that.

170
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:53,900
Because like, I think also the reason why, like, um, like, you know, during that time for me, it was, a lot of stuff was going on.

171
00:09:54,560 --> 00:10:03,880
And, uh, like I said, like, you know, nobody really wanted, like, professionally wise, no one really wanted to, like, touch me, you know?

172
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:11,420
And also, like, um, there was a lot of false rumors and narratives being spread about me behind the scenes.

173
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:15,020
And I remember someone approaching me about some of the false rumors.

174
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:20,600
And I had to provide them, like, proof and actual, like, personal documents to show that it was false.

175
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:22,020
And it was very crazy.

176
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,580
Like, some of the malicious stuff that was, like, spread about me that weren't even true.

177
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:30,980
That was said about me behind my back and spread around during that time.

178
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:37,760
And, um, it's also why I kept to myself for so long and not really done much interacting with new people.

179
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:44,500
Because, like, you know, who knows what people were saying behind my back and, um, about me.

180
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:48,260
And then that they, like, oh, these people might secretly hate me or had this false image of me.

181
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,780
Because, like, of all the rumors going around at that time.

182
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,480
And I already had really bad trust issues.

183
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,180
So at a point I was very, like, you know, fucking paranoid.

184
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,680
I was, like, super paranoid at that time.

185
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,000
I was, like, I was like, oh, I can't trust anyone.

186
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,680
So, like, I'm super thankful to the people that still want to do things with me.

187
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,740
And interact with me.

188
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:07,640
And never, like, believed in the false rumors.

189
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:12,180
And that's why I'm really happy to see, like, such a big community there.

190
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,340
Supporting all these girls.

191
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,100
Um, and guy.

192
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:15,740
One guy.

193
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,280
I saw, like, Kuro's tweets.

194
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:24,380
Like, I'm the first and last v-shoujo male that they've ever hired.

195
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,800
But supporting all those girls plus one guy.

196
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:34,800
And, yeah.

197
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:39,420
And then, like, you know, having people approach me to hear my story after being told.

198
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:43,220
Even, like, there's, like, moments where they were, like, told to not interact with Doki.

199
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,420
Like, don't interact with her.

200
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:47,980
Um, because, like, these false narratives are spread about me.

201
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:55,360
And, um, and then, like, you know, they were willing to listen to, like, my side of the story.

202
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:02,040
And, uh, and then, you know, when they approached me about it, I usually provided proof that the rumors were false.

203
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:02,540
You know?

204
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:07,800
And then, like, at one point, though, the brain worms started attacking.

205
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,580
And I was, like, I won't say, like, it was not resentful.

206
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,920
But I felt, like, super worthless for, like, not being good enough to even be considered.

207
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:16,220
Or, like, helped.

208
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,060
Or, like, you know, even followed on Twitter.

209
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:21,580
Like, I was very jealous at that time.

210
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:28,300
It was, like, definitely hard since I had to, like, build my own thing up for a year.

211
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:32,280
And there was a lot of, like, you know, setbacks and how messy everything was.

212
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,540
Like, you know, merch.

213
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:37,380
And I made a lot of mistakes trying to build my own thing.

214
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:48,920
And it was very hard because at first, when I started trying to rebuild everything, like, it was just me and, like, a very small, like, like, maybe, like, one to two people.

215
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:54,560
Like, you know, one, two to three people helping me try to build everything from the ground up.

216
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:58,120
I didn't have, like, you know, a lot of help back then.

217
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,560
Um, just starting it.

218
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:03,600
But then, like, it got better and better, like, as things go on.

219
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:06,700
And, you know, we're finally, you know, almost in the clear.

220
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,120
And I can sort of see the light now.

221
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:11,180
But for those who are like, oh, just go indie.

222
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,080
It's very hard.

223
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,380
When you have, like, the structure.

224
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:28,020
When you have the structure and safety, the safety net of, like, a company, and then you transition to indie, it's incredibly hard to do something like that.

225
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,280
It's a huge jump.

226
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:33,720
Especially when you have to do stuff from the ground up.

227
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,980
And it's not, it's like, it depends on what kind of indie you want to be.

228
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:42,500
Like, obviously, like, corporal, like, corporal VTubers, they have a lot more.

229
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,180
Like, it's not just streaming.

230
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,780
There's a lot more things going into it.

231
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:52,360
Um, you know, there's, like, events, merchandising, sponsors, branding, everything like that.

232
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,440
And to try and replicate that as an indie is very difficult.

233
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:58,440
Um, like, trying to sell yourself by yourself.

234
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:00,140
Especially as an individual.

235
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,260
You're not selling, like, a brand image.

236
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,460
Because, like, that's the thing.

237
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,540
When you're in a company, you're selling, like, a group of people.

238
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,120
But now that you're an individual, you have to sell yourself.

239
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,080
So you have to be like, no, no.

240
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:12,820
Pick me.

241
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,060
Even though I'm an individual, you should pick me.

242
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:16,540
And that's very hard to do.

243
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,440
Um, it's incredibly hard.

244
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,240
This is why I've been, I'll tell you this now.

245
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:28,120
I've been more busy as an indie than I've ever been as, um, when I was in a company.

246
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,380
Um, and even then, this is why you don't see much events from me these days.

247
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:39,600
Because I've been doing more so behind the scenes work than I have been focused.

248
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:44,780
Because, okay, the reason why I had so many events back then was because I was so fucking bored.

249
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,920
Like, I had no other things to do.

250
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:56,380
Um, you know, I wasn't getting, like, you know, I wasn't really getting sponsors or, like, you know, stuff I should do for the company.

251
00:14:56,380 --> 00:15:01,180
At that time, everything I did back then was, like, stuff I wanted, like, I had nothing to do.

252
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:06,060
Like, so then I did these events because I was, like, um, I wanna say bored.

253
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:08,740
Okay, maybe bored is the wrong word to pick.

254
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:13,300
But, like, um, there was just, like, nothing.

255
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:20,820
Like, I could just stream or I could do something, you know, do something worthwhile instead of just, like, coasting and stuff.

256
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:31,580
Um, I just had, yeah, um, I had a very open schedule.

257
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:36,340
Yeah, um, so, yeah, I had a lot of ambition, too.

258
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:46,060
But now that I am in indie, uh, now that I'm indie, there's so many other things I have to do behind the scenes.

259
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:50,420
Which prevents me from actually doing, you know, organizing events and stuff.

260
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,620
Because, like, there's, you know, I need to market myself.

261
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:57,560
Um, where I have to market myself and stuff like that.

262
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:01,420
So, for those who are like, oh, just start it, just, you know, start a company.

263
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:02,980
Or, like, indie's not that bad.

264
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,600
Oh my gosh, it's so hard.

265
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:11,420
But to be fair, it depends on what kind of streamer you wanna be.

266
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:16,360
And for me, in terms of, like, what I wanna be as a streamer, I have a lot of ambition.

267
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:19,760
And I have a lot of, like, ideas and things I really wanna do.

268
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,900
Because I don't want to just stream.

269
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,740
I wanna, like, do more than that.

270
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,440
I have a lot of, like, crazy ideas.

271
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,620
I wanna put out a bit forth.

272
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:39,420
Um, um, and, and that's why, like, um, uh, that's why, like, for me, I'm always busy almost every day because of it.

273
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:42,660
Like, I have, like, a huge list of tasks that I have to follow and everything.

274
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,040
And, like, a lot of things to reply to and stuff like that.

275
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:53,940
So, um, so, like, you have to be a workaholic to really, like, do the stuff I'm currently doing.

276
00:16:54,600 --> 00:17:02,040
Um, just because, like, uh, just because, you know, like, I just like doing all these things.

277
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,260
Because I have, I guess I have a lot of ambition and things.

278
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:08,160
So, um, it's very understandable why people wanna choose the corporate route.

279
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:15,540
Because, you know, being here by yourself, it's just a whole different step into, like, it's just a lot.

280
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:17,260
It's, it's, it is really a lot.

281
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:26,540
And even then, like, I've cried several times before about how much work I had to do to, um, like, throughout this journey and everything.

282
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:35,160
And, um, that's why, like, I really feel for these girls because, like, they never, you know, they were never, they never anticipated this.

283
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,560
Sorry, girls plus one guy.

284
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,000
Uh, I'm sorry, Kuro.

285
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,160
Yeah, it's a lot of networking, too.

286
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,160
Because, you know, the company can help you do the networking.

287
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:51,540
But, uh, um, um, um, but then you have to do your own networking now.

288
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,600
Um, but yeah, so, the one guide.

289
00:17:54,600 --> 00:18:05,680
Uh, uh, but yeah, like I said, like, for those, these girls, you know, they're, like, thrust into, basically, being thrust into being indie again.

290
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:11,700
And that's, that's a, a big, you know, what's the word?

291
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:17,800
That's, like, a huge, they, they were not expecting this out of nowhere.

292
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,840
Like, not, I mean, I won't say out of nowhere.

293
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:25,460
They just, you know, I felt like maybe they didn't have a lot of time to just be thrust into that.

294
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:28,160
Um, it was such a huge shock and everything.

295
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,420
Yeah, the blind side of all that.

296
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:30,820
Yeah.

297
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,240
So, I understand.

298
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:37,800
So, that's why I would love if everybody showed them lots of love.

299
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,340
Um, and appreciation.

300
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:45,800
And, you know, give them the support to adjust to being an indie.

301
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:51,560
Um, or, like, transition, maybe they'll be able to, you know, transition to another company.

302
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:56,020
Or, um, transition into being a indie and everything.

303
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,800
So, yeah, I just want to say, I just want to make that statement.

304
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:04,520
Um, because, like, it did, it did open, like, a lot of, like, PTSD about that.

305
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:07,560
So, I really feel for everybody that's going through this right now.

306
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:13,000
Um, and, oh my gosh, sorry, I'm making this too much about, like, myself and stuff.

307
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:19,060
But, it's just, like, based off, like, my own experiences, I could, like, sort of feel for them a lot.

308
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:22,360
Um, so, yeah, support them.

309
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:25,720
Um, check out Min's Anniversary Stream tomorrow.

310
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:31,160
Um, donate to the Immune Deficiency Foundation, the Tiltify for that.

311
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,200
Um, check out the girls.

312
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,420
Apparently, they're doing a collab, what could have been.

313
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:43,060
Um, and, uh, uh, yeah, I emphasize, I empathize with them a lot.

314
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:47,260
So, I do hope that they don't, the girls that did get in won't stop dreaming.

315
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:51,160
Um, and, you know, um, I hope they make it.

316
00:19:51,480 --> 00:20:00,360
Um, I hope they find, you know, the audience, uh, through this, be able to find a bigger audience and a bigger support community and everything.

317
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:03,000
Um, yeah, the charity reached a million dollars.

318
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:09,760
That's actually, like, double of what, like, you know, what the initial goal, like, well, I mean, the initial goal is, like, $10,000.

319
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:13,340
But, you know, I mean, it was double of what, um, was stolen.

320
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:20,920
So, uh, um, so, yeah, huge, like, huge congratulations to everybody.

321
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:37,800
Um, um, and, uh, I hope that, uh, I hope, you know, everybody lands on their feet and everyone's, you know, everyone is able to achieve what they want to achieve in the future without needing, uh, Shoujo and everything.

322
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,740
Oh, man, that's, like, I just wanted to make this extra statement.

323
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:45,640
Well, my original intent was to be, like, no, I was never approached.

324
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:48,900
Because I, I, it was so weird seeing that around.

325
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:49,880
I just, I don't know.

326
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,860
I just don't like false narratives about me going around.

327
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:56,120
So, I just wanted to, like, be very clear about that.

328
00:20:56,120 --> 00:21:07,860
It's like, wow, like, Doki, I can't, I can't believe Doki might, like, was also, like, approached to be, like, they tried to poach Doki, too, because they were trying to, they recruited men.

329
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,600
So, they must have been trying to poach Doki.

330
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:15,600
So, I was like, no, like, if anything, I got zero offers from anyone.

331
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:22,380
Like, it was very rough down there when I got fired.

332
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:29,580
Like, I really did appreciate, like, all the...

333
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:58,080
Um, I really appreciate, uh, that, uh, um, that, like, uh, a lot of companies, uh, not VTuber, not agencies or VTuber companies, but, like, you know, like, companies, like, you know, Hyatt, Gamersupps, um, and, you know, U2s, Nendroid, they were willing to work with me as an individual.

334
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,740
Um, as an individual as well.

335
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,360
Like, they, they extended their hand.

336
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,800
They're like, we don't care, like, we don't care about what's going on with you right now.

337
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,100
Like, like, we want to, you know, work with you.

338
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,460
And I really appreciate that.

339
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:21,720
So, I hope that all the other girls, um, are able to have, like, similar experiences as well with, um, with working with, like, not needing a company to work with these brands.

340
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:30,540
Because I always thought that I needed a company to work with these brands, but obviously, like, now, um, now I know, like, you don't need a company for that.

341
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:34,520
You can get these brands yourself without needing a corporate backing.

342
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:38,900
Um, it is a lot harder, though, because, you know, you can't use a company lawyer.

343
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,240
You have to use your own lawyer.

344
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:44,520
And even then, like, you know, lawyers are expensive and stuff like that.

345
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:50,740
So, that's, like, some of the biggest challenges that, like, in terms of, like, finding the right lawyer to look through contracts and stuff.

346
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:54,500
Because I made some mistakes in my first few initial contracts.

347
00:22:55,300 --> 00:23:02,780
And, um, from my own experience, I didn't make a few, like, mistakes for my initial contracts.

348
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,240
Just because I didn't, like, read it fully and stuff.

349
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,140
Um, I didn't, like, read it fully.

350
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,860
I was just, like, signed.

351
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:12,900
You know?

352
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:16,280
But, like, now, now, you know, I have more experience with it.

353
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:22,160
My, I, um, I actually, okay, the first few contracts I signed, I didn't have a lawyer read it.

354
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:27,020
So, because I was just, like, I was just so happy, you know?

355
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,640
I got, like, offers and everything.

356
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,260
I was just, like, yay!

357
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:31,800
Sign my name!

358
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:35,500
I, so, like I said, I learned all of this the hard way.

359
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:43,560
But, like, obviously, the more I'm, the more I learn, the more, like, the more, the more, I got a lawyer.

360
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:46,240
I have a lawyer looking through all my contracts now.

361
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:50,800
Like, they wouldn't be, you don't understand.

362
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,820
Like, I just desperately wanted to be me.

363
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,020
I just, I, you don't understand.

364
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:58,220
Back then, I just wanted someone to want me.

365
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,500
You don't, I had nothing.

366
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:07,060
Like, if you guys remember before then, in the before times, like, I barely got anything.

367
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:11,420
So, like, so, so, I mean, I won't say I barely got anything.

368
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:18,500
But, like, in comparison, I felt like I was, like, not, like, I was just, like, um, what's the way?

369
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:27,640
I felt like I had to try so hard to get one thing back then.

370
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:35,560
And so, like, um, to even get, like, just one thing, I felt like I had to try so hard.

371
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:43,100
Um, and, um, so then, like, you know, when I got fired, I was just like, I was like, oh my god.

372
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:45,180
Like, I was like, you want me?

373
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:52,280
Like, I was like, oh my god, you want me to advertise your product?

374
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:53,140
Holy shit.

375
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,860
I was just like, whoa!

376
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:13,040
Um, but yeah, I, I do hope, uh, I do hope, like, like, all these, all the girls, plus one guy, uh, I'm sorry, I shouldn't keep music doing that gym.

377
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,980
I, it's just too easy.

378
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:33,320
Uh, Be able to, you know, get on your feet, um, and recover, and they have so much support right now, but I just, I hope that everyone is able to get all the support and love, um, that, um, they need at the moment.

379
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,180
So, yeah, check, check all the girls out.

380
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:36,740
Plus Girl.

381
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:42,100
And, you know, support them during the transition.

382
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,800
And your friend Steve.

383
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:52,920
Steve.

384
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,980
Yeah, anyway, that's the statement I wanted to make.

385
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:55,300
Sorry.

386
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,320
I don't want people to think I'm making it about me.

387
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:58,920
I'm sorry.

388
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:02,260
It gave me, like, a lot.

389
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:11,960
Like I said, it gave me, like, when, like, all this, like, unfolded, I was just, it reopened, like, some wounds for myself.

390
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:16,240
Because, like, not wounds, like, trauma from what happened to me, too.

391
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:21,180
So, it just felt like, so I'm, like, so emotional about all of this.

392
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,300
Like, the PTSD and everything.

393
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,680
So, like, but my story is done.

394
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:27,560
It's done.

395
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:28,680
We closed.

396
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,980
The book on that.

397
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:34,480
Yeah, like, yeah, it's the flashbacks.

398
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:35,020
Yeah.

399
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,160
But, yes, let's play!

400
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,960
Wu-Chang Fallen Feathers.

401
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:48,060
I have been looking forward to this game for a while.

402
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:50,420
I was, I forgot that this game came out this month.

403
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:52,280
Like, it felt like it came out so fast.

404
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:56,220
Like, I legitimately, I felt like I watched the trailer for this so recently.

405
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:57,640
And then it's, like, out now.

406
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:04,220
And, yeah, I heard people thought, say this game is really good.

407
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:09,180
For those who don't know, it is, um, it's, so, it's basically an RPG Souls-like.

408
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:13,640
Um, but it's based off of, yes, it is from a Chinese developer.

409
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:18,480
Because it's based off of Chinese history and, uh, folklore.

410
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:27,240
So, um, so if you guys know, like, Wu-Kan, it's, I don't know if it's, like, I think it's, like, sort of similar.

411
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:34,080
Um, but instead of playing as a monkey, you get to play as a hot girl.

412
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:39,140
Uh, yeah, I saw some Wu-Kan, but hot girls are hot women.

413
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:44,820
And they're, uh, so instead of my monkey, it's, uh, hot woman.

414
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:49,540
Um, and I, it looks, the trailer looked really good.

415
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:55,920
And I like that it was based off of, like, uh, folk, like, you know, uh, Chinese folklore mythology.

416
00:27:55,920 --> 00:28:01,380
Which I'm a sucker for, because I love, um, I love Chinese folklore.

417
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:05,880
As someone, like, grew up with, like, stories and, like, TV shows and movies about it.

418
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,220
And I read, I love mythology in general.

419
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:10,280
I love reading different types of mythologies.

420
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,620
Like, not just China, but, like, from all around the world.

421
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:16,840
But I feel like, you know, it's been so long since we had, like, games.

422
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:22,140
Like, I feel like we never really had games based off of Chinese folklore and mythology and history.

423
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:26,040
Other than, like, you know, we have three kingdoms that's just based off of the three kingdoms.

424
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:27,540
But, like, I eat that shit every day.

425
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:29,920
Like, I, I love the three kingdoms.

426
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:37,620
I love that they, they, I, I don't care if Dynasty Warriors, like, rehash the story over and over again.

427
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:40,600
I want to see this story over and over again.

428
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:46,680
And, like, by the way, what I meant, like, I meant, like, I, I eat that, that up.

429
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:51,880
Like, I don't mean, like, shit as in bad, but as in, like, I, I, it's like, um, it's just a slang.

430
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,000
So I'm just like, yum yum yum.

431
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:55,040
I love this so much.

432
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:57,520
I don't mean it's bad.

433
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:02,220
I meant as in like, I love it so much that I will consume it daily.

434
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:03,880
Also, give me a sec.

435
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:05,720
My precooked meals are coming.

436
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:07,580
Open the door for them.

437
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,580
Let me open the door for my precooked meal.

438
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:13,780
Alright, there you go.

439
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:17,220
But like... I'll consume that content.

440
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:20,460
I love... I love Dynasty Warriors.

441
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:22,360
I love the Three Kingdom history.

442
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,120
Yum yum yum yum yum.

443
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:28,540
I love it so much.

444
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:34,700
But like, we only... when it comes to like, you know, AAA gaming and gaming in general...

445
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:40,100
Like, you know, gaming in general, we don't really get a lot of Chinese history games.

446
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:43,200
Like, games based off China's history other than the Three Kingdoms.

447
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:47,100
Because, you know, everyone knows about the Three... Like, the Three Kingdoms is like...

448
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:53,420
It's like such a... Um, you know, like, based off of Romance of the Three Kingdom, which I also love...

449
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:56,240
Like I said, I love the era of the Three Kingdoms.

450
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,120
So I consume... I've like, you know, read lots of...

451
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,700
I've read the original books.

452
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,360
I've visited the tombs and everything of Lu Bei.

453
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,280
I visited Lube's tomb.

454
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:11,140
I've watched so many movies based off the Three Kingdoms and everything.

455
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:19,020
And yeah, it's like basically like, you know, the Three Kingdoms is sort of like... I guess you'd say the Three Kingdoms is sort of like King Arthur.

456
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:24,680
But yeah, but a lot of games tend to just follow the Three Kingdoms.

457
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:29,660
And there's a lot of interesting points and periods in Chinese history.

458
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:39,400
So it's really nice to see like... it's nice to see the... you know, like them going through a different era.

459
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:48,140
And also integrating, you know, Chinese mythology and Chinese folklore into, you know, into like the game as well.

460
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,440
So I'm really looking forward to it.

461
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,080
I will say that they did give me an early access key.

462
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:55,680
I didn't play it at all, even though I did get a free early access key.

463
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:58,340
Because they were like, you can't stream it unless until launch day.

464
00:30:58,340 --> 00:30:59,620
So I was like, what's the point, you know?

465
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:06,020
Like, you can play it off stream and like make a video about it before the launch day.

466
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:08,400
But I was like, I'm gonna stream it, you know?

467
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:15,400
Yeah, I was like, I was like, but I don't want to stream it.

468
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,960
So I waited until today to stream the game.

469
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:25,340
Yeah, like, you know, I want to like react to it like blindly with all of you.

470
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:31,460
Um, uh, but yeah, anyway, I'm looking forward to it.

471
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,020
Let's go check it out.

472
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:35,060
bup, bup, bup, bup, bup, bup.

473
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:35,380
Alright.

474
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:39,730
d d d d d d d d d d d d d d here we go.

475
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:41,610
Alright.

476
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:47,770
I don't think it will compile shaders again, because I compiled it, uh, off stream.

477
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:48,810
So we'll see.

478
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:51,230
I know that I definitely have to adjust the graphics though.

479
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:57,010
Because, uh, I could tell that it's gonna be intensive.

480
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:03,810
Wait, nice hoodie.

481
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:04,290
Thank you.

482
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:08,930
I saw in the trailer there's a half-naked bird lady, so I figured I should match it as well.

483
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:12,010
Not the half-naked part, the bird lady part.

484
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:14,810
Just so you guys know.

485
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:17,230
Not the half-naked part.

486
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:22,250
Okay, that should be good.

487
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:23,970
Brightness.

488
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:27,970
This should be fun.

489
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:33,850
Alright.

490
00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:37,750
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba!

491
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:46,250
Alright.

492
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:50,150
Oh, there's a photosensitive seizure warning.

493
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:50,650
Okay.

494
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:52,590
Wait, where- Oh, I didn't get to read it.

495
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:54,410
The story is a work of fiction.

496
00:32:54,590 --> 00:33:01,330
Any resemblance between the character, groups, events, language, or other elements within the work?

497
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:03,190
And you're like, I'm purely coincidental.

498
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:04,750
No.

499
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:06,690
No.

500
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:08,330
They're real to me.

501
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:12,030
But they're real to me.

502
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:14,810
Oh, shit.

503
00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:15,090
Nice.

504
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:16,130
Free.

505
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:19,210
I love free stuff.

506
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:19,510
Alright.

507
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:22,070
Uh... Tutorial on.

508
00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:26,730
I don't like... I don't like stream vibration.

509
00:33:27,170 --> 00:33:27,810
Streamer mode?

510
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:32,710
Blood, gore from game, and adjust certain... You know what?

511
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:33,770
Let's...

512
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:40,210
If anything, they just take my monetization.

513
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:41,050
Okay, guys?

514
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:42,130
I'm not that scared.

515
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:45,310
I... My final words before my channel gets deleted.

516
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:49,110
Look, look.

517
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:49,330
See?

518
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:56,230
It just says, you know, disables blood, gore, and adjust certain co- Okay, let's... Let's test bait.

519
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:01,270
Let's test it.

520
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:03,150
I feel risky today.

521
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:10,610
Um... By the way, remember when I told you guys that, um... Um...

522
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:14,090
I forgot to, like, put a music credit in my description.

523
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:16,370
And then, like, my appeal got rejected.

524
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:18,570
And I had, like, one last chance to do it.

525
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:24,750
Before, uh... Before, like... If it gets rejected again, they'll put an actual strike on my channel.

526
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:29,850
Well, I got a... Um... That... The gambling paid off, because I...

527
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:34,610
Got a reply back, and they're like, we whitelisted your channel, so you should be good now.

528
00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:35,530
So, look at that.

529
00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:36,810
Gambling paid off.

530
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:40,670
Risking my entire channel for $10 paid off, guys.

531
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:43,350
Now I don't have to put the credit on the description anymore.

532
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:44,370
Like...

533
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:50,110
For the sake of not... Of not playing.

534
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:53,570
For the sake of me, so I could do less work.

535
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:59,270
I risked my entire channel, so I could do less work.

536
00:34:59,450 --> 00:34:59,950
Let's go.

537
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:02,470
And it's, like, a five-second thing, too.

538
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:03,570
Like...

539
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:08,310
It was literally, like, five seconds of, like, oh, hey.

540
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:11,310
All I had to do was literally just, uh...

541
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:13,050
Um...

542
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:13,970
Wait, let's do full screen.

543
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:15,290
Wait, there's no full screen?

544
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:16,310
Oh.

545
00:35:17,170 --> 00:35:18,050
That's interesting.

546
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:22,150
You know you would sooner be full... Okay, let's just play it on 60 frames, I guess.

547
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:23,930
Um...

548
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:26,070
But, yeah, I... I risked it all.

549
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:30,870
Worth the... Yeah, it was worth the 50-50.

550
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:33,370
So I could do five seconds of...

551
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:38,010
I could do, like, five seconds less work.

552
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:40,390
We take those.

553
00:35:42,290 --> 00:35:42,730
Okay.

554
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:44,430
Alright, let's see.

555
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:45,190
I just gotta make sure.

556
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:47,570
Sorry, I'm, like, all over the place right now.

557
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:50,130
Uh...

558
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:50,870
This is fine.

559
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:51,810
This should be fine.

560
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:53,490
All in.

561
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:55,690
Yeah, I took that gamble and paid off.

562
00:35:57,430 --> 00:35:59,250
Alright, is my sound guy alive?

563
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:03,730
Yeah, risking it all so I don't have to...

564
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:05,490
Control-C, Control-V.

565
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:17,060
I didn't execute you.

566
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:18,880
I just put blood on your hands.

567
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:20,880
That's different.

568
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,200
I showed them... I showed everyone...

569
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,140
That...

570
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,800
You're not one of them.

571
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,740
...

572
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,380
Clemo, thank you...

573
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:46,400
Welcome to Tomato Farm!

574
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:47,360
Welcome, welcome!

575
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:02,180
Alright.

576
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,100
Move around.

577
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:05,600
Oh, hey!

578
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:06,780
Pick up.

579
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,040
What's this?

580
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,720
Red Mercury Sprout.

581
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:11,500
Okay.

582
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,420
She's cute!

583
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:14,400
Can I change your clothes?

584
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:14,860
Haha!

585
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:15,260
Sorry!

586
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,480
She's cute!

587
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:20,080
Alright, now can I change your clothes yet?

588
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:20,940
Haha!

589
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,060
Okay.

590
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:25,440
You lose health when attacked and from some status effects.

591
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:28,140
Dropping from on height may also reduce your health.

592
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,640
Okay, so there is fall damage.

593
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:32,740
Stamina is spent when sprinting, dodging, and attacking.

594
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:33,900
Okay.

595
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:38,900
Raising the stat increases your maximum health, stamina, strength.

596
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:39,680
Oh, no.

597
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,160
I can't add chat for this, guys.

598
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:45,520
I just realized you don't even know what's good.

599
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:46,800
Oh, no!

600
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,420
How will I add chat now?

601
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:55,440
Raising the stat increase the damage of feathering control.

602
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:58,360
We don't know what's good!

603
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:00,700
No one knows!

604
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:03,600
It's okay!

605
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:06,660
The dragoons are 38 minutes into the future, might know.

606
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:10,340
Raising the stat increases the damage of magic controls.

607
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:11,220
Raising the stat...

608
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:12,140
Okay, so there's...

609
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:13,580
What the fuck is feathering?

610
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:18,680
Okay, so there is a weapon that does feathering.

611
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,400
When can I change my clothes?

612
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:22,460
Um, excuse me.

613
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:24,340
I have free DLC items.

614
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,200
Uh, where is it?

615
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,760
Okay, let me...

616
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,780
Okay, what do we not need?

617
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,940
We'll do vegetation quality.

618
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:36,820
We never need...

619
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:37,580
Like...

620
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:38,060
Grass.

621
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:39,300
Alright.

622
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:41,600
Okay.

623
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,600
LRB is like...

624
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:46,820
Okay, well, I like how the left side tells me...

625
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:47,640
Like...

626
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,700
Wait, if I'm here, does it...

627
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:51,960
How run?

628
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,620
Switch spells...

629
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:57,200
Okay, it doesn't tell you how to run yet.

630
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:57,540
Oh.

631
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:58,700
Flash...

632
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:00,300
Flash bomb.

633
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,200
Flash grenade.

634
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,180
Get flash banged.

635
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:16,820
Light!

636
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:17,540
I'm blind!

637
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,960
Oh my god!

638
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:20,420
Whoa!

639
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:21,880
Whoa.

640
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,820
Oh my god, is she okay?

641
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:31,230
Oh, cool.

642
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:31,850
Free sword.

643
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:47,820
Oh my god.

644
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:50,940
A hot lady gave me a free sword.

645
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:51,720
Nice!

646
00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:57,290
Directed by...

647
00:39:57,290 --> 00:39:58,850
Let's see who again.

648
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:08,280
Oh!

649
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:16,300
Looks pretty.

650
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:17,740
Oh, I love this.

651
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:18,540
It looks like a...

652
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:19,520
Chinese painting.

653
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:20,320
You know?

654
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:21,460
Like the...

655
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:24,580
What's it called in English?

656
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:26,120
Like the...

657
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:26,840
The...

658
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,300
The ink...

659
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,400
Chinese paintings?

660
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:31,500
Oh my gosh, I don't remember what it's called in English.

661
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,340
It's been so long since I...

662
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:34,300
Said it in English.

663
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:37,400
Uh...

664
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:38,960
The scroll...

665
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:39,940
Is it a scroll painting?

666
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:40,340
Yeah.

667
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,120
Uh...

668
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,660
With the ink brushes and everything.

669
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:50,520
Ink painting...

670
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:51,100
Is it calligraphy?

671
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,260
Is it calligraphy?

672
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,280
Because there's like...

673
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:56,000
You can use it for calligraphy and stuff, but...

674
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:56,940
It's not...

675
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:57,900
Calligraphy.

676
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,300
I used to take...

677
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:07,360
Um...

678
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,360
Calligraphy classes.

679
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,200
And also like Chinese painting classes.

680
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:11,660
You think they're bad people?

681
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:13,560
Okay, yeah.

682
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:14,800
They might be.

683
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,680
You know, maybe they're not even bad people.

684
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,240
I just...

685
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:21,340
I just decided to stab them.

686
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,700
Like literally, they're not even doing anything bad.

687
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:29,400
That's cool.

688
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:30,740
I like the graphics.

689
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:32,220
The graphics are really nice.

690
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:34,420
Yeah, they're just...

691
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:35,660
They literally were just...

692
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,420
Gathering stuff for their family.

693
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:38,860
And I was like, I don't like you.

694
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:44,520
They're just...

695
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:49,200
I used to take like...

696
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:51,260
Um...

697
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:51,600
Uh...

698
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,940
Calligraphy and also like...

699
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:54,260
Uh...

700
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:55,040
Ink painting cl...

701
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:55,300
Uh...

702
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:55,920
Classes.

703
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,340
Chinese painting classes too.

704
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,740
With the brushes and everything.

705
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:03,920
Reverent temple.

706
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:05,020
Oh, yeah.

707
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,000
This definitely feels very souls-like.

708
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,440
In terms of like...

709
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:11,820
And...

710
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:15,020
By what I mean, they like thrusted me into this world with like...

711
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,080
I don't...

712
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:17,720
Like I...

713
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:18,580
It's just exploring.

714
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:19,620
And stuff.

715
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:20,900
And then you uncover...

716
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:22,920
How to play the game.

717
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:24,180
As you go along.

718
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,040
You're awake at last.

719
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:28,720
Yeah, there's like no...

720
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:29,420
No...

721
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:30,360
No actual tutorial.

722
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:49,760
In a brooklet some days passed.

723
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:53,120
You lay passed out due to the feathering.

724
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:54,160
The feathering?

725
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:56,280
I moved you to the cave to recuperate.

726
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,200
She's becoming a bird!

727
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,200
I see...

728
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:02,640
No...

729
00:43:04,970 --> 00:43:07,830
A man-eating fiend attacked worship's rise.

730
00:43:08,230 --> 00:43:09,130
Six moons ago...

731
00:43:09,130 --> 00:43:10,390
Oh, you're picking vegetables?

732
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:11,790
Time to die!

733
00:43:12,570 --> 00:43:13,190
Thank you, thank you, this.

734
00:43:13,330 --> 00:43:13,610
Reach out.

735
00:43:13,710 --> 00:43:14,490
Thank you, thank you.

736
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:16,590
I

737
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:24,080
found this silk manuscript on your person.

738
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:24,960
Here.

739
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:25,900
Take it.

740
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:38,120
Should you have other concerns?

741
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:39,180
Pray.

742
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:40,360
Speak then.

743
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:41,280
Okay.

744
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:44,520
Uh...

745
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:47,080
Weapon Forged by the legendary...

746
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:49,400
So what do I have technically?

747
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:51,120
Where the fuck is my pay to win cosmetic?

748
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:54,300
Sorry, not pay.

749
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:56,920
Given to me for free cosmetic.

750
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,120
Can I actually stab him?

751
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:03,020
Alright, let's find out.

752
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:05,080
Okay, no.

753
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:06,480
You can't kill NPCs here.

754
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:07,400
Which is good.

755
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:08,480
Because like...

756
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:11,320
I might have done it.

757
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:14,240
That's good that I can't accidentally kill him.

758
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:16,240
What was that?

759
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:18,500
You're not from around here, are you?

760
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:20,880
The name's Charlene.

761
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:22,540
Charlene?

762
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:25,840
Don't you dare look down on me just cause I'm crippled.

763
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:29,960
My brother and I were once the town's finest heroes.

764
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:31,500
Oh, now you're blind.

765
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:32,260
What happened?

766
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:36,540
But now my brother's burden was finding medicine to treat me.

767
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:39,740
A pathetic fool.

768
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,200
I don't think no medicine can fix your blindness.

769
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:47,000
You don't...

770
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,720
I don't think you even have eyes anymore.

771
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:51,640
Oh my gosh.

772
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:52,900
Where are your eyes?

773
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:57,940
Could you do me a favor and deliver this to an oracle there?

774
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:00,280
She's hard to miss.

775
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:00,860
Oh.

776
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:02,620
That skips everything?

777
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:03,660
Okay.

778
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,460
Could you do me a favor?

779
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:08,800
I literally walked like one step away from him.

780
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:10,920
She's hard to miss.

781
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:15,940
She's had this old bracelet for as long as I can remember it.

782
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:17,920
She's a bit...

783
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:18,780
different.

784
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:21,800
You'll know her when you see me.

785
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:24,260
Oh, she doesn't look like a regular person, right?

786
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:25,260
She's still in town.

787
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:27,760
Please, check for me.

788
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:29,580
I've gone myself.

789
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:31,800
I can't.

790
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:34,100
Not in this pathetic state.

791
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:35,940
If you find her.

792
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:38,580
Don't tell her.

793
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,420
I'm stuck at the reverend temple.

794
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:42,580
Tell her.

795
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:44,240
You think he needs a somber story?

796
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:45,840
To make a name for herself.

797
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:47,760
Tell her.

798
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:49,880
I'll come back.

799
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:51,960
You're like, tell her I was a hero.

800
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:56,320
I made something.

801
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:56,800
Okay.

802
00:45:57,340 --> 00:45:58,120
Wait, is that everything?

803
00:45:58,540 --> 00:45:58,900
Yeah, tell her.

804
00:45:59,240 --> 00:45:59,560
Okay.

805
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:00,740
I wanna be sure.

806
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:02,560
Okay, let's turn...

807
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:04,640
Uh...

808
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:06,800
Master volume and...

809
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:08,460
BGM volume here.

810
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:09,600
Okay, I hope that's better.

811
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:10,940
Alright.

812
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:12,660
So we got a special pill.

813
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:17,480
I know some of you guys were like, Oh, can you do Chinese voice?

814
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:18,820
The thing is...

815
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:20,280
Um...

816
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:21,740
I...

817
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:25,000
I...

818
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,320
I don't really wanna read.

819
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:36,460
I-I don't really wanna read.

820
00:46:41,730 --> 00:46:42,840
Reading is...

821
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:44,020
Sort of...

822
00:46:44,020 --> 00:46:45,120
Very hard.

823
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:45,960
I'm tired right now.

824
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:50,500
I sort of just... Oh wait, donation box?

825
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:51,480
Who donated that?

826
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:52,900
Oh my gosh, Nance.

827
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:56,880
Nance, that was... Oh my gosh, he's tall.

828
00:46:58,140 --> 00:46:59,100
He doesn't want it.

829
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:00,980
Understandable.

830
00:47:01,660 --> 00:47:03,500
You seem to have recuperated well.

831
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:08,540
The old Taoist mentioned your encounter with that demon, Liu Hongnu.

832
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:12,080
I am glad to see you on your feet again.

833
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:14,360
But your arm...

834
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:16,720
The feathers are still there.

835
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:19,180
The feathering's a nasty curse.

836
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:22,260
Even the Taoist doesn't have a cure for it.

837
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:23,040
Oh no!

838
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:26,880
With your skills, maybe you should check out the Shusamptim.

839
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:29,520
Wait, what's so bad about the feathering, though?

840
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:33,420
But like, don't I get to have like, cool-ass powers?

841
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:36,280
Like, what's wrong with that?

842
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:38,860
I already see it like it's a bad thing.

843
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:43,040
Most people have to be carried out of the Reverend Temple.

844
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:46,220
You, though, you get to walk out on your own.

845
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:46,660
Yeah!

846
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:51,800
Xunyangzi may be harsh with his words, but he tends to my eyes every...

847
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:53,300
Yeah, get the... that's the flower!

848
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:57,580
Some of the worship's rise folk came here, fleeing.

849
00:47:58,160 --> 00:47:59,600
But they didn't stay long.

850
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:05,180
They rushed back out, unaware of how dangerous the world truly is.

851
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:07,620
Okay, who are you?

852
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:08,500
Tao Qing?

853
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,900
Just a humble merchant seeking refuge.

854
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:15,480
I run a small trading business to make ends meet.

855
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:19,360
Do you happen to have any rare goods for me to take a look at?

856
00:48:19,660 --> 00:48:20,000
Oh!

857
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,680
This face is all I've got left.

858
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:24,760
Mmm, smooth to the touch.

859
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:27,780
With a fragrance that's hard to come by.

860
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:30,540
This is no ordinary treasure.

861
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:32,340
Oh, but don't worry.

862
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:35,280
I won't be tempted to take it for myself.

863
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:38,100
What are you gonna do with my vase?

864
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:41,160
This place is no paradise for a merchant.

865
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:44,600
I'm thinking of heading to the Shu Sanctum.

866
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:50,060
I hear the Ming troops are stationed there, and it's a safer bet than this old temple.

867
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:52,560
I can trade with you, of course.

868
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:53,960
It would be an honor.

869
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:56,000
But for the real treasures?

870
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:01,260
I'm afraid I'll need to ask for a little favor in return.

871
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:05,740
Some thieves from Anilum stole my family's heirloom.

872
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:08,100
An ancient landscape painting.

873
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:12,320
Get it back for me, and I'll make it worth your while.

874
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:20,780
You can find Anilum by taking the side entrance from the stage at worship's rise, then crossing a long bridge.

875
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:25,100
Once you've retrieved the painting, meet me at the Shu Sanctum.

876
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:27,620
I'll have a reward waiting for you.

877
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:28,300
Okay.

878
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:39,240
Oh, DLC is... Oh wait.

879
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:41,520
Offer blood at Shrine to awaken his powers?

880
00:49:41,660 --> 00:49:44,320
Oh, this is the... Here.

881
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:48,880
This is like the... The... Um... The bonfire.

882
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:53,680
But with blood.

883
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:55,440
With a blood god.

884
00:49:58,720 --> 00:49:59,520
Oh, nice.

885
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:00,860
Offer blood at a shrine.

886
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:01,980
Is this where I level up?

887
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:02,940
Oh yeah, it is!

888
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:06,480
Having activated a shrine, you can enter the dream from there.

889
00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:08,680
Entering the dream fully restores your health.

890
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:11,140
Uh... My blood fire.

891
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:12,460
And advances the story.

892
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:17,780
Uh... However, most enemies... Yeah, okay, so this is the... Uh...

893
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:19,420
Okay, so enter the dreams.

894
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:20,320
What is this?

895
00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:22,380
Level up unlocks... Oh, there we go!

896
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:24,140
Must be in here, right?

897
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:26,440
Because it was not in here.

898
00:50:26,780 --> 00:50:27,600
Ha ha ha ha!

899
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:30,420
Alright.

900
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:32,200
Let's... What's this?

901
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:33,200
Oh!

902
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:37,940
You may access the impetus repository from the shrines.

903
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:40,820
There you can spend the red mercury essence and lock nodes.

904
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:43,480
Thus, gaining new effect or discipline skill.

905
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:46,800
Press reset points for... to reset it.

906
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:48,920
Okay, so there's a skill tree, too.

907
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:53,220
There you can... Uh...

908
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:53,660
Okay.

909
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:58,080
Each weapon has... Uh...

910
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:00,860
Has ways in which to gain skyboard might.

911
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:02,860
You can acquire these by locking nodes.

912
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:04,660
You can also increase your maximum might.

913
00:51:05,740 --> 00:51:06,340
With...

914
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:06,880
You think?

915
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:07,260
Okay.

916
00:51:08,820 --> 00:51:09,420
So...

917
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:12,380
I could get the blink kick.

918
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:12,840
Oh!

919
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:14,420
That's interesting.

920
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:19,900
I also have, like, a skill tree...

921
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:20,980
On...

922
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:22,020
How big is it?

923
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:23,260
I don't know.

924
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:24,560
That seems a lot.

925
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:25,420
Ha ha ha!

926
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:26,260
Ha ha ha!

927
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:26,760
Ha ha ha!

928
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:29,720
There's, like, stuff all the way...

929
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:31,340
Like, at the top, guys.

930
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:33,120
There's, like, something on...

931
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:34,000
The fucking...

932
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:34,740
Centaur.

933
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:35,960
Ha ha ha!

934
00:51:36,540 --> 00:51:37,020
Ha ha ha!

935
00:51:37,540 --> 00:51:38,060
Okay.

936
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:40,660
Evade all...

937
00:51:40,660 --> 00:51:43,340
To avoid the enemy's attack fully.

938
00:51:44,180 --> 00:51:44,700
Or...

939
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:45,160
Have...

940
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:45,560
Goddamn.

941
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:46,300
I can't add chat.

942
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:47,700
The game literally just came back.

943
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:48,780
So there's no meta.

944
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:49,540
That's so...

945
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:49,960
Ha ha ha!

946
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:50,940
I can't...

947
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:52,760
No one knows what the meta is!

948
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:53,920
Oh my god!

949
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:54,540
Ha ha!

950
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:55,780
Drop down.

951
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:57,820
Load to launch a fierce kit.

952
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,240
UC for greater.

953
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:00,660
Super for long swords.

954
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:02,380
What sword do I have?

955
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:02,980
Ha ha ha!

956
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:04,740
The meta is unknown!

957
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:06,460
I don't know!

958
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:08,420
Ha ha!

959
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:09,340
I have to...

960
00:52:09,340 --> 00:52:11,520
I define the meta now.

961
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:14,680
Um...

962
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:15,840
Follow your heart!

963
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:18,800
Oh, I can't even...

964
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:20,920
Oh, I can't even level this up.

965
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:21,680
I just realized...

966
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:22,100
Oh wait, no!

967
00:52:22,220 --> 00:52:23,380
It's cause, like, it's...

968
00:52:23,380 --> 00:52:24,920
It's this...

969
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:26,760
The meta is no meta.

970
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:28,520
Wait, before I go to the shrine...

971
00:52:29,060 --> 00:52:31,280
Someone said I can, like, go to the...

972
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:32,360
Weapon skills.

973
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:33,620
What's my weapon skills?

974
00:52:33,620 --> 00:52:34,080
Oh!

975
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:36,280
That's my weapon skill.

976
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:37,060
Okay.

977
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:39,440
But actually...

978
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:42,790
Oh my god, maybe I didn't...

979
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:45,940
Maybe I didn't...

980
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:47,320
What?

981
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:48,520
Where's my clothes?

982
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:49,680
Okay, it's okay.

983
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:50,320
I don't...

984
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:51,160
We'll do it...

985
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:52,460
We'll do it...

986
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:53,040
Uh...

987
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:53,780
Vanilla style.

988
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:55,920
No extra cosmetics.

989
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:56,780
No pay to win.

990
00:52:57,060 --> 00:52:58,040
I can do it.

991
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:01,800
We don't need pay to win.

992
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:05,020
Uh, therns.

993
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:05,940
Thank you for the super chat.

994
00:53:06,060 --> 00:53:06,700
Thank you, thank you.

995
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:08,400
Yo, red mercury essence.

996
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:10,220
I love drinking mercury.

997
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:11,720
Thank you for the super chat.

998
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:13,220
Thank you, thank you.

999
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:18,080
Alright.

1000
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:20,600
Okay, so that's skill.

1001
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:20,920
Whoops.

1002
00:53:21,460 --> 00:53:21,920
Oh.

1003
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:23,500
Oh, the skill is like...

1004
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:26,100
Oops.

1005
00:53:27,340 --> 00:53:27,860
Whoops.

1006
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:30,240
Accidentally drank my potion.

1007
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:32,180
Guess I...

1008
00:53:32,180 --> 00:53:32,660
Oh my gosh.

1009
00:53:32,740 --> 00:53:34,820
I need the tutorial thing to show up again.

1010
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,200
I accidentally drank my flask.

1011
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:45,040
Okay, do I get my flask again?

1012
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:45,900
Okay, I got three.

1013
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:46,900
Okay, I do.

1014
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:48,240
That's good to know.

1015
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:51,960
Okay, that's...

1016
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:52,840
The attack.

1017
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:55,280
There's like...

1018
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:57,070
I saw that there was a parry.

1019
00:53:57,860 --> 00:54:00,540
But I need to look at the tutorial thing again.

1020
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:01,440
Hello?

1021
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:05,380
Are you infected too?

1022
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:08,200
Are you infected too?

1023
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:14,240
Says the feathering outbreak in Worship's Rise.

1024
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:17,080
Many have fallen ill.

1025
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,380
First, feathers start growing on your arms.

1026
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:23,080
Then you lose your mind.

1027
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:23,460
Oh!

1028
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:28,100
Before long, you're turning to a monster that craves human flesh.

1029
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:30,980
Guys, maybe the feathering is not a good thing.

1030
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:33,360
Shang Yanzi brought me to the Reverend Temple.

1031
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,420
Guys, maybe that's not good.

1032
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:37,280
The medicine has kept me going.

1033
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:40,320
But who knows how long it'll last.

1034
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:41,820
Oh, that sounds bad.

1035
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:44,080
Your symptoms are lighter than mine.

1036
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:47,020
Best stay here and recover.

1037
00:54:47,020 --> 00:54:47,920
Okay.

1038
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:49,500
There's utter chaos out there.

1039
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:51,500
Especially in Worship's Rise.

1040
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:53,780
I doubt there are many survivors...

1041
00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:56,140
There's a thing that has too much burn.

1042
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:03,070
Still waiting for the Taoist to check on me.

1043
00:55:04,270 --> 00:55:06,150
Take care out there, young lady.

1044
00:55:08,130 --> 00:55:09,010
Okay, nice.

1045
00:55:09,110 --> 00:55:09,990
I got a special pill.

1046
00:55:09,990 --> 00:55:12,140
Okay, we have to...

1047
00:55:16,660 --> 00:55:17,550
Sound settings.

1048
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:19,790
Up by three.

1049
00:55:21,490 --> 00:55:24,110
Down by three.

1050
00:55:24,870 --> 00:55:25,670
And then...

1051
00:55:25,670 --> 00:55:26,570
Master volume up?

1052
00:55:26,770 --> 00:55:27,290
Okay.

1053
00:55:27,590 --> 00:55:28,610
Let me know if that's good.

1054
00:55:29,250 --> 00:55:30,670
Oh wait, there's a tutorial here.

1055
00:55:31,150 --> 00:55:31,590
Okay.

1056
00:55:33,810 --> 00:55:34,510
Combat.

1057
00:55:34,830 --> 00:55:35,170
Heavy.

1058
00:55:35,690 --> 00:55:36,370
Light.

1059
00:55:36,590 --> 00:55:37,250
Offer blood.

1060
00:55:37,650 --> 00:55:38,670
Entering the dream.

1061
00:55:38,670 --> 00:55:39,230
Wait.

1062
00:55:39,250 --> 00:55:40,430
I felt like there was more.

1063
00:55:40,650 --> 00:55:42,090
I feel like...

1064
00:55:42,730 --> 00:55:46,030
I felt like there was more stuff on my left side.

1065
00:55:46,990 --> 00:55:47,630
Oh, there we go.

1066
00:55:47,770 --> 00:55:48,470
Switch weapons.

1067
00:55:48,850 --> 00:55:49,650
Swift draw?

1068
00:55:50,670 --> 00:55:51,970
What's swift draw?

1069
00:55:53,650 --> 00:55:57,710
I saw the old Taoist carry you in the other day.

1070
00:55:59,930 --> 00:56:03,090
Looks like you caught the plague too, huh?

1071
00:56:04,810 --> 00:56:05,410
Feathers.

1072
00:56:05,410 --> 00:56:05,450
Feathers.

1073
00:56:06,450 --> 00:56:08,390
Growing on your arm now.

1074
00:56:10,230 --> 00:56:11,710
Just like mine.

1075
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:20,120
He's got a heart of gold.

1076
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:22,080
That old Taoist.

1077
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:28,880
But who knows if you'll ever come up with a miracle cure?

1078
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:32,940
What if he was the one that started all of this?

1079
00:56:36,620 --> 00:56:38,480
Wait, have you guys been stuck here for ages?

1080
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:42,020
That means, like... clearly there's enough time for me!

1081
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:55,280
Yeah, I was thinking, like... Clearly I have, like, plenty of time.

1082
00:56:58,120 --> 00:56:59,740
He is patient zero.

1083
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:02,360
I mean, he's still okay.

1084
00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:04,140
All he has is just a cough, right?

1085
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:07,100
He has a little cough.

1086
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:07,920
It'll be fine.

1087
00:57:08,340 --> 00:57:11,680
Also, like, my stamina bar is at my bottom left.

1088
00:57:11,980 --> 00:57:18,640
I would say I'm not really a fan of how tiny my stamina bar is on the screen.

1089
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:22,340
Like, that would be my critique so far.

1090
00:57:22,540 --> 00:57:26,740
Because it is very tiny and I feel like I'm gonna forget...

1091
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,080
To look at it.

1092
00:57:29,180 --> 00:57:29,280
Yeah.

1093
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:33,120
It's like my above-average stamina bar.

1094
00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:39,700
At the moment, I feel like you can't run unless... I don't know.

1095
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:40,780
Unless I'm fucking crazy.

1096
00:57:41,460 --> 00:57:44,960
But it doesn't feel like I can... I cannot run.

1097
00:57:45,660 --> 00:57:46,860
The best I can...

1098
00:57:46,860 --> 00:57:47,680
Oh wait, no!

1099
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:48,840
Okay, you have...

1100
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:49,740
Is this running?

1101
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:50,940
Am I running, or...?

1102
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:52,280
Yeah.

1103
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:53,600
Okay, you have to hold it.

1104
00:57:53,860 --> 00:57:54,420
Okay, never mind.

1105
00:57:55,700 --> 00:57:57,600
Okay, it's like you dash and then hold.

1106
00:57:57,940 --> 00:57:58,160
Yeah.

1107
00:57:59,660 --> 00:58:00,800
Gigantic claw marks.

1108
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:01,840
Okay, now I know.

1109
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:05,900
Okay, you have, like, a first dash before you start running.

1110
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:07,400
And your run...

1111
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:08,980
I think because there's no enemies.

1112
00:58:08,980 --> 00:58:09,980
It doesn't...

1113
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:12,980
It doesn't look like...

1114
00:58:12,980 --> 00:58:14,840
The sand that goes down for now.

1115
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:17,080
It doesn't open from the side.

1116
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:19,740
Okay, I guess we'll go this way.

1117
00:58:24,690 --> 00:58:27,510
Okay, kill me open with the Revenant key.

1118
00:58:28,070 --> 00:58:30,670
Okay, so I guess it's to the right then.

1119
00:58:31,990 --> 00:58:34,070
Okay, there's gigantic claw marks.

1120
00:58:34,550 --> 00:58:34,970
Oh!

1121
00:58:35,190 --> 00:58:37,790
I can see that random guy sitting there on the fire.

1122
00:58:39,110 --> 00:58:41,650
To be fair, he does blend in with the nature.

1123
00:58:44,770 --> 00:58:45,810
Oh, nice!

1124
00:58:45,970 --> 00:58:46,850
Steam Bunny Bun!

1125
00:58:47,030 --> 00:58:47,430
Oh, well.

1126
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:48,890
Look who's back.

1127
00:58:49,770 --> 00:58:51,810
Feeling lost, are we?

1128
00:58:53,370 --> 00:58:56,050
We are both wanderers of fate.

1129
00:58:56,450 --> 00:58:57,730
No need for formalities.

1130
00:58:59,470 --> 00:59:00,110
Now...

1131
00:59:00,110 --> 00:59:03,570
About the power in your left arm.

1132
00:59:03,870 --> 00:59:07,490
If you master it, you'll be unstoppable.

1133
00:59:07,490 --> 00:59:12,110
You might even rewrite destiny as we know it.

1134
00:59:12,110 --> 00:59:12,330
Ooh!

1135
00:59:15,030 --> 00:59:18,710
How about I introduce you to someone worthy?

1136
00:59:19,190 --> 00:59:21,410
Oh my god, what's wrong with your mouth?

1137
00:59:22,210 --> 00:59:23,650
You know how it goes.

1138
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:25,010
What's wrong with you?

1139
00:59:27,170 --> 00:59:27,970
Oh!

1140
00:59:28,350 --> 00:59:28,870
Oh!

1141
00:59:31,810 --> 00:59:33,310
What happened to you?

1142
00:59:34,730 --> 00:59:37,310
Oh my god, he looks so fucked up!

1143
00:59:38,130 --> 00:59:43,020
By the belt pinwheel.

1144
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:44,780
Pressing dodge to shimmer...

1145
00:59:44,780 --> 00:59:49,320
To shimmer and void an enemy move grants one skyboard increases and...

1146
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:53,600
Potency of skills, discipline skills, and weapon skills.

1147
00:59:53,820 --> 00:59:54,880
Okay, so how do I do that?

1148
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:56,900
Okay.

1149
00:59:58,340 --> 00:59:58,980
Alright.

1150
00:59:59,980 --> 01:00:00,600
Hit me.

1151
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:02,020
Oh, it's just a regular map.

1152
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:03,380
Wait, did I do it?

1153
01:00:05,020 --> 01:00:05,720
Wait, what?

1154
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:08,380
Okay, I timed it wrong.

1155
01:00:09,420 --> 01:00:10,620
Oh, there we go!

1156
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:12,380
Boom!

1157
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:13,880
There we go.

1158
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:18,620
Okay, I got it.

1159
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:24,920
I hope so, unless our mom cheated.

1160
01:00:34,730 --> 01:00:35,250
Oh?

1161
01:00:38,470 --> 01:00:39,810
I forgot what these are called.

1162
01:00:39,930 --> 01:00:41,430
It's been so long since I've seen them.

1163
01:00:50,130 --> 01:00:51,170
Oh, pinwheels!

1164
01:00:51,290 --> 01:00:51,550
Yeah!

1165
01:00:52,590 --> 01:00:54,510
That guy has scoliosis.

1166
01:00:55,630 --> 01:00:57,210
Might need to see a doctor for that.

1167
01:01:01,450 --> 01:01:01,970
Oh!

1168
01:01:05,370 --> 01:01:06,030
It's okay.

1169
01:01:06,970 --> 01:01:07,750
Can I do it?

1170
01:01:08,690 --> 01:01:09,530
Oh, nice!

1171
01:01:10,830 --> 01:01:11,410
Oh, shit!

1172
01:01:11,530 --> 01:01:11,870
Not nice!

1173
01:01:12,230 --> 01:01:14,030
Okay, but the dodges were cool though.

1174
01:01:16,710 --> 01:01:18,810
As I look at those cool dodges.

1175
01:01:19,430 --> 01:01:19,610
Wow!

1176
01:01:20,170 --> 01:01:20,570
Wow!

1177
01:01:21,550 --> 01:01:21,950
Wow!

1178
01:01:22,150 --> 01:01:22,350
Wow, shit!

1179
01:01:22,470 --> 01:01:23,230
Okay, okay, got it.

1180
01:01:23,430 --> 01:01:24,590
Sorry, I need to stop.

1181
01:01:27,330 --> 01:01:28,130
I'm sorry.

1182
01:01:28,750 --> 01:01:30,610
I'm fucking around too much.

1183
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:36,420
Look, I was trying...

1184
01:01:36,420 --> 01:01:37,080
I'm just trying...

1185
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:38,520
I was trying to figure out the dodges.

1186
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:38,840
No!

1187
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:45,300
Okay, I have fallen.

1188
01:01:45,580 --> 01:01:47,300
Okay, I need to focus there.

1189
01:01:48,340 --> 01:01:49,720
I was like...

1190
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:51,020
Oh, wait, does it...

1191
01:01:51,020 --> 01:01:52,200
Is it scripted?

1192
01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:53,160
Maybe it's scripted.

1193
01:01:53,380 --> 01:01:55,080
Maybe it's scripted, guys.

1194
01:01:57,260 --> 01:01:59,280
Okay, it was not scripted, guys.

1195
01:02:00,620 --> 01:02:05,760
Dropping to zero help results in this makes you drop red makery based on your current madness.

1196
01:02:06,100 --> 01:02:08,080
After which you arrive at the...

1197
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:09,220
Head back to place your cream.

1198
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:09,860
Oh, okay.

1199
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:10,960
The...

1200
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:11,800
Yeah, it's Souls rules.

1201
01:02:12,140 --> 01:02:13,080
It is Souls-like.

1202
01:02:14,620 --> 01:02:15,240
Okay.

1203
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:20,240
You adjust the camera mode on lock-on settings and then choose between standoff and classic.

1204
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:22,380
Before you switch between the two.

1205
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:26,760
For a rich visual experience, focus on the action.

1206
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:28,000
Or perform...

1207
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:31,520
Stable view for precision and quick reactions.

1208
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:32,400
What am I on?

1209
01:02:39,410 --> 01:02:40,030
Okay.

1210
01:02:40,310 --> 01:02:40,710
You know what?

1211
01:02:40,750 --> 01:02:41,730
We want to look nice.

1212
01:02:42,010 --> 01:02:42,650
That's fine.

1213
01:02:44,130 --> 01:02:45,750
Wait, there's new people here.

1214
01:02:46,410 --> 01:02:47,290
Wait, what?

1215
01:02:48,150 --> 01:02:50,010
Oh, it was scripted!

1216
01:02:50,430 --> 01:02:50,630
Oh!

1217
01:02:51,050 --> 01:02:51,810
Oh, shit!

1218
01:02:52,090 --> 01:02:54,090
I thought he was a good person!

1219
01:02:56,890 --> 01:02:58,130
I was like, hey there.

1220
01:02:59,690 --> 01:03:01,470
I was like, where is that guy?

1221
01:03:04,750 --> 01:03:05,770
I was like...

1222
01:03:06,530 --> 01:03:07,710
Where is he?

1223
01:03:09,010 --> 01:03:10,610
I thought he was like...

1224
01:03:10,610 --> 01:03:11,290
I don't know.

1225
01:03:11,610 --> 01:03:11,870
I...

1226
01:03:11,870 --> 01:03:15,230
I thought he wanted to talk to me, you know?

1227
01:03:15,930 --> 01:03:16,490
Like...

1228
01:03:16,490 --> 01:03:18,890
I didn't realize that they were bad people.

1229
01:03:19,290 --> 01:03:19,690
Oh my god.

1230
01:03:19,830 --> 01:03:20,390
I'm gonna burn.

1231
01:03:20,550 --> 01:03:20,830
Goodbye.

1232
01:03:27,450 --> 01:03:28,450
He just...

1233
01:03:28,450 --> 01:03:30,670
Like, he just went up and stabbed me!

1234
01:03:30,930 --> 01:03:31,010
I...

1235
01:03:31,010 --> 01:03:32,330
I don't understand!

1236
01:03:32,990 --> 01:03:34,890
Why did he stab me?

1237
01:03:35,210 --> 01:03:36,270
Like, I'm just...

1238
01:03:36,270 --> 01:03:37,530
Just a regular guy!

1239
01:03:38,590 --> 01:03:39,150
Okay.

1240
01:03:39,490 --> 01:03:40,690
I understand now, though.

1241
01:03:40,870 --> 01:03:41,390
I understand.

1242
01:03:48,850 --> 01:03:51,430
I can't believe he would just stab me like that!

1243
01:03:53,010 --> 01:03:53,490
Jesus!

1244
01:03:53,930 --> 01:03:54,690
What the fuck?

1245
01:03:54,690 --> 01:03:55,870
They cost so much damage!

1246
01:03:57,490 --> 01:03:58,270
Is he okay?

1247
01:03:58,850 --> 01:03:59,330
Okay.

1248
01:04:00,050 --> 01:04:01,790
Alright, where's my thing that I pick up?

1249
01:04:01,990 --> 01:04:02,810
Wait, how do I...

1250
01:04:02,810 --> 01:04:03,390
Oh, there it is.

1251
01:04:03,470 --> 01:04:03,870
It's blue.

1252
01:04:08,770 --> 01:04:09,730
Jesus Christ!

1253
01:04:09,730 --> 01:04:10,370
Okay.

1254
01:04:10,830 --> 01:04:11,290
They...

1255
01:04:11,290 --> 01:04:12,350
Do a lot of damage.

1256
01:04:15,110 --> 01:04:15,570
Okay.

1257
01:04:15,650 --> 01:04:17,110
There's no jump attacks, by the way.

1258
01:04:17,310 --> 01:04:18,150
Oh my...

1259
01:04:18,150 --> 01:04:18,950
Get me out of...

1260
01:04:18,950 --> 01:04:19,810
What?!

1261
01:04:19,810 --> 01:04:22,070
I can't believe I'm dying to Dorya!

1262
01:04:22,330 --> 01:04:22,790
Okay.

1263
01:04:23,790 --> 01:04:25,430
It's hard because, like...

1264
01:04:25,430 --> 01:04:29,130
I'm, like, trying to, like, unlearn Elden Ring controls into this.

1265
01:04:29,130 --> 01:04:29,810
So...

1266
01:04:29,810 --> 01:04:31,370
There's no...

1267
01:04:39,890 --> 01:04:40,370
I'm...

1268
01:04:40,370 --> 01:04:44,430
I'm, like, thinking my sword is the speed as my other weapon.

1269
01:04:44,710 --> 01:04:46,090
As, like, my katana.

1270
01:04:48,890 --> 01:04:50,810
Which I realize it's not...

1271
01:04:50,810 --> 01:04:51,350
Not true.

1272
01:04:53,390 --> 01:04:54,150
There we go.

1273
01:04:54,230 --> 01:04:54,450
There we go.

1274
01:04:54,490 --> 01:04:54,590
See?

1275
01:04:54,690 --> 01:04:55,130
Okay, there we go.

1276
01:04:55,210 --> 01:04:55,750
We got this.

1277
01:04:55,750 --> 01:04:57,430
I figured it out.

1278
01:04:59,330 --> 01:04:59,890
Okay.

1279
01:05:00,210 --> 01:05:01,410
And then I got my...

1280
01:05:01,410 --> 01:05:02,430
Red Mercury back.

1281
01:05:02,890 --> 01:05:03,090
Okay.

1282
01:05:06,010 --> 01:05:06,570
Okay.

1283
01:05:07,950 --> 01:05:08,510
Okay.

1284
01:05:08,810 --> 01:05:09,610
Oh my god!

1285
01:05:10,250 --> 01:05:11,190
Didn't I...

1286
01:05:11,190 --> 01:05:11,830
Do some...

1287
01:05:11,830 --> 01:05:12,110
Oh!

1288
01:05:12,330 --> 01:05:12,530
Oh!

1289
01:05:12,710 --> 01:05:12,950
Okay!

1290
01:05:13,290 --> 01:05:13,850
So...

1291
01:05:13,850 --> 01:05:15,430
After my dodge...

1292
01:05:15,430 --> 01:05:17,030
Like, I can do this.

1293
01:05:17,030 --> 01:05:19,050
And that uses the ability for it.

1294
01:05:19,570 --> 01:05:20,170
There we go.

1295
01:05:21,790 --> 01:05:22,350
Alright.

1296
01:05:22,590 --> 01:05:23,530
I figured it out.

1297
01:05:23,530 --> 01:05:28,430
After your dodge, I have to either use LB or LT.

1298
01:05:31,170 --> 01:05:31,850
Okay.

1299
01:05:32,190 --> 01:05:32,930
Go this way.

1300
01:05:36,130 --> 01:05:36,810
Nice.

1301
01:05:37,710 --> 01:05:39,930
You have two weapons equipped at any time.

1302
01:05:40,210 --> 01:05:40,950
Switch weapons.

1303
01:05:40,950 --> 01:05:42,090
Oh, okay.

1304
01:05:42,230 --> 01:05:44,190
This is where I can equip different weapons.

1305
01:05:46,450 --> 01:05:47,010
Uh...

1306
01:05:47,710 --> 01:05:49,210
Level two agility.

1307
01:05:50,810 --> 01:05:51,930
Mighty axe.

1308
01:05:52,210 --> 01:05:53,290
Plus one.

1309
01:05:53,850 --> 01:05:54,990
So this is more...

1310
01:05:55,710 --> 01:05:56,270
Okay.

1311
01:05:58,590 --> 01:05:59,150
Okay.

1312
01:05:59,350 --> 01:06:01,190
Oh, I can block with this.

1313
01:06:02,630 --> 01:06:03,810
Okay, there's this.

1314
01:06:03,990 --> 01:06:05,570
Okay, this one lets me block.

1315
01:06:05,570 --> 01:06:06,510
So each...

1316
01:06:07,090 --> 01:06:07,590
Alright.

1317
01:06:11,190 --> 01:06:11,690
Nice.

1318
01:06:11,890 --> 01:06:12,170
Oh, yeah.

1319
01:06:12,910 --> 01:06:14,890
I can put two weapons now.

1320
01:06:15,190 --> 01:06:16,090
So I can swap.

1321
01:06:20,320 --> 01:06:23,760
After this and Elder Ring, you have to unlearn this control...

1322
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:24,780
Wait, is he a good person?

1323
01:06:25,840 --> 01:06:26,660
Okay, he...

1324
01:06:26,660 --> 01:06:27,060
I...

1325
01:06:27,060 --> 01:06:27,360
Wait.

1326
01:06:28,700 --> 01:06:30,860
I gotta talk to him first before I do anything.

1327
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:34,560
Who are you?

1328
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:41,660
Oh, I have amnesia.

1329
01:06:41,720 --> 01:06:41,820
Oh, yeah.

1330
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:42,560
I have amnesia.

1331
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:44,980
Bayou?

1332
01:06:57,800 --> 01:06:59,720
They say it leads to memory loss.

1333
01:06:59,820 --> 01:07:00,020
Yeah.

1334
01:07:03,460 --> 01:07:05,220
Okay, but is it really that bad?

1335
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:13,980
Like,

1336
01:07:19,220 --> 01:07:20,160
you know...

1337
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:22,080
At least, like, I won't...

1338
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:25,420
I will already be crazy, so I won't get, like, mad...

1339
01:07:25,420 --> 01:07:26,540
Like, mad me crazy.

1340
01:07:28,900 --> 01:07:30,100
The Shu Sanctum.

1341
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:33,800
Okay.

1342
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:39,600
Apparently, if you eat too much human meat, you can go crazy.

1343
01:07:40,660 --> 01:07:42,140
Because, like, there's, like, a...

1344
01:07:42,140 --> 01:07:42,760
Was it...

1345
01:07:42,760 --> 01:07:45,240
There's, like, a parasite that, like, fucks you with your brain.

1346
01:07:46,380 --> 01:07:49,020
If you encounter danger, don't fight.

1347
01:07:49,740 --> 01:07:51,580
I'll follow your trail and find you.

1348
01:07:52,140 --> 01:07:53,060
Oh, and...

1349
01:07:53,060 --> 01:07:54,080
Take this.

1350
01:07:55,600 --> 01:07:57,060
This bamboo lantern.

1351
01:07:57,740 --> 01:07:58,900
I found it nearby.

1352
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:01,780
Hard to believe such craftsmanship still lingers here.

1353
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:04,960
It's a reminder of how vibrant this town was.

1354
01:08:05,300 --> 01:08:06,780
The fireflies inside.

1355
01:08:07,140 --> 01:08:08,920
They seem to glow endlessly.

1356
01:08:09,560 --> 01:08:11,140
A useful light for your path.

1357
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:12,980
I've tested it personally.

1358
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:15,140
With this, you'll have both hands straight for weapons.

1359
01:08:15,140 --> 01:08:16,140
Oh, it's only if you eat the brain?

1360
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:17,500
Oh, so there's no consequences.

1361
01:08:18,140 --> 01:08:18,760
To be in camp.

1362
01:08:18,980 --> 01:08:19,760
Since we got separated.

1363
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:23,820
Many of the Imperial Guards have been sneaking around the Tang Emperor's palace.

1364
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:25,660
Technically, there's no consequences, then.

1365
01:08:25,660 --> 01:08:27,600
The place has already been ransacked by rebels.

1366
01:08:29,500 --> 01:08:30,700
Technically, yeah.

1367
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:31,700
Something's not right.

1368
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:33,500
I will track down the boatmen.

1369
01:08:34,100 --> 01:08:34,680
And we'll meet at the pass.

1370
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:36,320
What about the boatmen?

1371
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:37,120
Only get caught.

1372
01:08:38,620 --> 01:08:40,160
Follow them, and you'll find me.

1373
01:08:41,780 --> 01:08:42,280
Okay.

1374
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:43,760
We'll just have to follow them.

1375
01:08:45,380 --> 01:08:45,880
Um...

1376
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:46,900
Where is the...

1377
01:08:46,900 --> 01:08:47,820
What's the lantern go?

1378
01:08:48,740 --> 01:08:49,780
And light the...

1379
01:08:49,780 --> 01:08:51,320
And use again to extinguish.

1380
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:51,620
Okay.

1381
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:52,960
So this is my lantern.

1382
01:08:54,820 --> 01:08:55,340
Uh...

1383
01:08:55,340 --> 01:08:56,800
Overtime for certain durations.

1384
01:08:57,260 --> 01:08:57,900
Oh, okay.

1385
01:08:59,420 --> 01:08:59,940
Alright.

1386
01:09:00,300 --> 01:09:01,280
We'll go this way.

1387
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:04,280
Oh, 11 skills.

1388
01:09:04,540 --> 01:09:05,220
Light attack.

1389
01:09:05,660 --> 01:09:06,200
Cast spells.

1390
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:10,300
Oh, that's why they don't like me.

1391
01:09:10,940 --> 01:09:11,760
That makes sense.

1392
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:14,300
That's right.

1393
01:09:14,460 --> 01:09:15,540
Get your ass out of here.

1394
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:17,680
How dare you call me a monster?

1395
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:21,300
Because of that, I'll kill you to prove that I am.

1396
01:09:21,300 --> 01:09:22,320
I am one a monster.

1397
01:09:24,260 --> 01:09:25,080
That's right.

1398
01:09:25,340 --> 01:09:26,000
It's a circle.

1399
01:09:28,060 --> 01:09:28,600
Alright.

1400
01:09:28,700 --> 01:09:29,740
I like the halberd.

1401
01:09:30,940 --> 01:09:32,080
Spin to win.

1402
01:09:32,220 --> 01:09:32,600
Exactly.

1403
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:38,100
Where do I go?

1404
01:09:40,240 --> 01:09:40,920
This way?

1405
01:09:42,580 --> 01:09:45,380
He did point to me on where I should be going.

1406
01:09:45,580 --> 01:09:46,440
But then like...

1407
01:09:46,440 --> 01:09:49,220
He just pointed at a general direction.

1408
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:51,600
So like...

1409
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:52,900
It wasn't that helpful.

1410
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:53,980
Not gonna lie.

1411
01:09:54,940 --> 01:09:56,220
It took you here in my last $10.

1412
01:09:56,580 --> 01:09:58,420
Spend them on buying your birthday merch.

1413
01:09:58,780 --> 01:09:59,120
Um...

1414
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:00,140
Thank you for the super chat kill.

1415
01:10:00,240 --> 01:10:00,480
Thank you.

1416
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:01,160
Thank you.

1417
01:10:01,380 --> 01:10:02,320
I hope you...

1418
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:04,620
I hope you enjoy my birthday merch.

1419
01:10:05,060 --> 01:10:06,200
When it comes.

1420
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:08,600
That avoid any...

1421
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:10,220
Grants one stack of skyboard.

1422
01:10:10,300 --> 01:10:12,860
You can learn unique weapon mechanics in the...

1423
01:10:12,860 --> 01:10:13,980
To gain even more.

1424
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:16,560
Impedus repository.

1425
01:10:16,780 --> 01:10:17,820
Oh, is that the skill, right?

1426
01:10:22,590 --> 01:10:23,710
That's the...

1427
01:10:23,710 --> 01:10:25,730
Allows you to counter enemy attacks.

1428
01:10:25,850 --> 01:10:27,490
How does no effects against such as...

1429
01:10:27,490 --> 01:10:27,670
Okay.

1430
01:10:28,770 --> 01:10:29,810
Back in...

1431
01:10:29,810 --> 01:10:30,450
Back in everything.

1432
01:10:32,130 --> 01:10:32,650
Okay.

1433
01:10:32,870 --> 01:10:33,250
Spin!

1434
01:10:36,830 --> 01:10:37,350
Spin!

1435
01:10:39,210 --> 01:10:39,730
Alright.

1436
01:10:39,990 --> 01:10:41,850
You can equip three jade pennants.

1437
01:10:42,770 --> 01:10:43,270
Uh...

1438
01:10:43,270 --> 01:10:44,310
Choosing the pennant.

1439
01:10:44,730 --> 01:10:47,630
That best fit your weapon style will give you advantage in combat.

1440
01:10:48,110 --> 01:10:48,310
Okay.

1441
01:10:48,370 --> 01:10:48,670
Nice.

1442
01:10:48,930 --> 01:10:49,090
Wait.

1443
01:10:49,110 --> 01:10:49,930
He didn't even have any.

1444
01:10:50,670 --> 01:10:51,190
What the fuck?

1445
01:10:51,370 --> 01:10:52,410
Why did that come up?

1446
01:10:52,410 --> 01:10:53,810
I didn't even get a pennant.

1447
01:10:54,350 --> 01:10:54,790
Like...

1448
01:10:54,790 --> 01:10:54,830
Haha.

1449
01:10:56,270 --> 01:10:56,490
Oh.

1450
01:10:56,570 --> 01:10:56,850
Oh wait.

1451
01:10:56,910 --> 01:10:57,170
I did.

1452
01:10:57,290 --> 01:10:57,450
Wait.

1453
01:10:57,670 --> 01:10:57,790
What?

1454
01:10:57,990 --> 01:10:59,470
When did that show up in my inventory?

1455
01:11:01,010 --> 01:11:01,830
I didn't even...

1456
01:11:01,830 --> 01:11:02,050
What?

1457
01:11:02,110 --> 01:11:02,990
I didn't even see that.

1458
01:11:05,130 --> 01:11:05,570
Okay.

1459
01:11:07,790 --> 01:11:08,850
I was like, huh?

1460
01:11:09,170 --> 01:11:10,890
When the fuck did I pick it up?

1461
01:11:14,390 --> 01:11:14,830
Alright.

1462
01:11:15,250 --> 01:11:15,650
Oh.

1463
01:11:15,770 --> 01:11:16,230
There's items.

1464
01:11:17,490 --> 01:11:17,810
Yay.

1465
01:11:19,010 --> 01:11:19,710
Free stuff.

1466
01:11:22,410 --> 01:11:23,610
At least like, the item...

1467
01:11:23,970 --> 01:11:24,470
When...

1468
01:11:24,470 --> 01:11:27,190
The items are like, super noticeable so I can't miss them.

1469
01:11:28,850 --> 01:11:30,030
A flying dagger.

1470
01:11:32,430 --> 01:11:33,610
Good or bad?

1471
01:11:37,170 --> 01:11:37,850
Hello?

1472
01:11:38,190 --> 01:11:38,530
Oh.

1473
01:11:38,810 --> 01:11:39,110
Good.

1474
01:11:40,130 --> 01:11:41,910
Feathers on your left arm.

1475
01:11:41,990 --> 01:11:42,210
Yeah.

1476
01:11:42,830 --> 01:11:44,190
That's a sign of feathering.

1477
01:11:44,510 --> 01:11:44,830
Mmhmm.

1478
01:11:45,670 --> 01:11:48,090
Most would've lost their minds by now.

1479
01:11:48,430 --> 01:11:49,110
But...

1480
01:11:49,110 --> 01:11:50,790
You remain in control.

1481
01:11:51,730 --> 01:11:52,310
Hmm.

1482
01:11:53,330 --> 01:11:53,850
Fascinating.

1483
01:11:55,790 --> 01:11:58,910
The power of feathering was the one of yours.

1484
01:11:58,930 --> 01:11:59,690
The power of feathering was the one of yours.

1485
01:11:59,890 --> 01:12:01,950
I can't do it.

1486
01:12:03,290 --> 01:12:07,030
How you manage to contain it, I don't know.

1487
01:12:07,390 --> 01:12:13,930
But make no mistake, your left arm is the key to unleashing its full strength.

1488
01:12:15,890 --> 01:12:19,870
Yes, that power is itching to course through you.

1489
01:12:20,990 --> 01:12:24,230
But... I'm afraid you're not ready to command it.

1490
01:12:24,710 --> 01:12:25,550
Not yet.

1491
01:12:26,490 --> 01:12:27,910
Oh, I don't know the magic yet.

1492
01:12:27,930 --> 01:12:28,570
Take this.

1493
01:12:29,050 --> 01:12:30,290
Oh, Mercury!

1494
01:12:30,790 --> 01:12:33,830
You've got what it takes to wield that power.

1495
01:12:34,030 --> 01:12:34,850
What do I have to do?

1496
01:12:40,700 --> 01:12:43,620
Okay, so you can't accidentally kill the NPCs.

1497
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:45,560
That's... that's good to know.

1498
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:47,960
I swear that I can't jump, though.

1499
01:12:49,540 --> 01:12:50,900
Yummy, yummy, Mercury!

1500
01:12:52,240 --> 01:12:55,840
This pretty lady singledookie, I'm asking for myself.

1501
01:12:56,480 --> 01:12:57,740
Oh, thank you for the super chat.

1502
01:12:57,860 --> 01:12:58,720
Thank you, thank you.

1503
01:12:58,840 --> 01:12:59,600
Wait, how do I get...

1504
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:01,140
Okay, I have to be on the other side.

1505
01:13:03,540 --> 01:13:03,940
Evil?

1506
01:13:04,300 --> 01:13:04,700
Evil.

1507
01:13:07,100 --> 01:13:07,500
Spin!

1508
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:09,860
That's right.

1509
01:13:10,820 --> 01:13:11,420
That's right!

1510
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:12,580
Get out of here!

1511
01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:14,680
Alright.

1512
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:18,240
Spin!

1513
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:19,460
Spin!

1514
01:13:19,460 --> 01:13:20,160
I like the spin!

1515
01:13:21,060 --> 01:13:23,880
I feel like maybe this is only good for like...

1516
01:13:23,880 --> 01:13:25,060
Regular...

1517
01:13:25,060 --> 01:13:26,080
Enemies.

1518
01:13:26,660 --> 01:13:29,640
And consume sky might to unleash a powerful...

1519
01:13:30,920 --> 01:13:31,620
Swift draw.

1520
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:32,700
Oh!

1521
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:33,980
Do I have it?

1522
01:13:41,080 --> 01:13:42,300
Okay, no I don't.

1523
01:13:42,760 --> 01:13:43,080
Wait.

1524
01:13:43,740 --> 01:13:44,560
Lie to me!

1525
01:13:46,540 --> 01:13:46,980
Okay.

1526
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:48,280
Okay.

1527
01:13:48,280 --> 01:13:48,660
Oh, shit!

1528
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:50,040
Oh, shit!

1529
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:51,400
Wait, wait, wait, wait a minute.

1530
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:55,000
Wait, before any of that happens...

1531
01:13:55,560 --> 01:13:56,380
It's beam time.

1532
01:13:58,840 --> 01:13:59,280
Spin!

1533
01:13:59,900 --> 01:14:00,660
Oh, shit!

1534
01:14:02,780 --> 01:14:03,420
That's right!

1535
01:14:03,980 --> 01:14:05,100
Get out of here!

1536
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:08,760
Okay, why the fuck do I do any other...

1537
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:10,600
Use any other weapon.

1538
01:14:11,700 --> 01:14:13,220
This sword fucking sucks.

1539
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:17,640
Hello?

1540
01:14:17,960 --> 01:14:18,740
Are you alive?

1541
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:21,680
Whoops!

1542
01:14:23,380 --> 01:14:24,500
Are you alive?

1543
01:14:26,660 --> 01:14:27,380
Hello?

1544
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:29,620
Okay, I think he's dead.

1545
01:14:30,220 --> 01:14:30,380
Alright.

1546
01:14:33,080 --> 01:14:33,740
Oh, yeah.

1547
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:33,980
Oh, yeah.

1548
01:14:33,980 --> 01:14:34,600
No, they...

1549
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:35,060
Oh, yeah.

1550
01:14:35,160 --> 01:14:35,820
They're definitely dead.

1551
01:14:35,940 --> 01:14:36,300
Oh, my God!

1552
01:14:36,460 --> 01:14:36,720
They're...

1553
01:14:36,720 --> 01:14:37,820
Are these monks?

1554
01:14:38,380 --> 01:14:39,620
They're so messed up!

1555
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:40,520
What do the monks think?

1556
01:14:40,660 --> 01:14:41,020
They don't...

1557
01:14:41,020 --> 01:14:42,220
They don't even do anything!

1558
01:14:42,580 --> 01:14:43,500
They're like peaceful!

1559
01:14:45,420 --> 01:14:46,380
They're vegetarians!

1560
01:14:48,060 --> 01:14:50,280
What do the monks even do to you?

1561
01:14:55,270 --> 01:14:57,970
Bro, they're just harmless vegetarians.

1562
01:15:01,940 --> 01:15:03,100
That's messed up.

1563
01:15:06,930 --> 01:15:07,450
Alright.

1564
01:15:08,310 --> 01:15:09,350
Let's see...

1565
01:15:09,350 --> 01:15:10,790
Did I tell you...

1566
01:15:10,790 --> 01:15:11,210
Oh, I know.

1567
01:15:11,330 --> 01:15:12,190
I did tell you guys, sir.

1568
01:15:12,290 --> 01:15:13,750
For those who don't know...

1569
01:15:14,130 --> 01:15:16,690
One time, during a school trip...

1570
01:15:17,250 --> 01:15:22,430
My teacher took us to a temple.

1571
01:15:24,510 --> 01:15:25,030
And...

1572
01:15:25,030 --> 01:15:27,110
At that time, I was really young.

1573
01:15:27,250 --> 01:15:33,510
So I didn't realize that all the monks there working...

1574
01:15:33,510 --> 01:15:34,150
Or like...

1575
01:15:34,150 --> 01:15:35,510
You know, we're like at the temple...

1576
01:15:36,030 --> 01:15:37,170
Not working, sorry.

1577
01:15:37,350 --> 01:15:37,930
What's the word?

1578
01:15:38,670 --> 01:15:39,810
Not working!

1579
01:15:40,470 --> 01:15:40,590
Not working!

1580
01:15:40,590 --> 01:15:41,070
Um...

1581
01:15:41,070 --> 01:15:41,780
That live there...

1582
01:15:43,030 --> 01:15:43,690
Um...

1583
01:15:43,690 --> 01:15:45,350
That live there...

1584
01:15:45,350 --> 01:15:46,490
Were vegetarians!

1585
01:15:47,270 --> 01:15:47,930
Uh...

1586
01:15:47,930 --> 01:15:48,770
And so...

1587
01:15:48,770 --> 01:15:49,870
My mom...

1588
01:15:49,870 --> 01:15:51,370
Packed me...

1589
01:15:51,370 --> 01:15:51,990
Um...

1590
01:15:51,990 --> 01:15:52,760
A chicken burger...

1591
01:15:54,630 --> 01:15:55,610
For lunch!

1592
01:15:57,230 --> 01:15:57,790
So...

1593
01:15:57,790 --> 01:15:59,650
We went to like...

1594
01:15:59,650 --> 01:16:00,050
We...

1595
01:16:00,050 --> 01:16:01,610
We went to like...

1596
01:16:01,610 --> 01:16:02,270
A...

1597
01:16:03,870 --> 01:16:04,430
Uh...

1598
01:16:04,430 --> 01:16:04,530
Uh...

1599
01:16:04,530 --> 01:16:05,250
Went to like...

1600
01:16:05,250 --> 01:16:06,870
A restaurant that they own...

1601
01:16:06,870 --> 01:16:08,370
And like, cook at...

1602
01:16:08,370 --> 01:16:08,890
Um...

1603
01:16:08,890 --> 01:16:10,010
And like, you know...

1604
01:16:10,010 --> 01:16:11,010
Everything was like...

1605
01:16:11,010 --> 01:16:11,770
Made out of tofu...

1606
01:16:12,230 --> 01:16:13,190
Or was like...

1607
01:16:13,190 --> 01:16:13,610
Vegetables...

1608
01:16:13,610 --> 01:16:14,330
Toe vegetables...

1609
01:16:14,330 --> 01:16:14,850
And like...

1610
01:16:14,850 --> 01:16:16,410
I was really young...

1611
01:16:16,410 --> 01:16:16,890
And like...

1612
01:16:16,890 --> 01:16:17,590
Ignorant...

1613
01:16:17,590 --> 01:16:18,210
So...

1614
01:16:18,210 --> 01:16:19,570
I was like...

1615
01:16:19,570 --> 01:16:20,330
I'm hungry.

1616
01:16:20,590 --> 01:16:21,110
Cause they're like...

1617
01:16:21,110 --> 01:16:21,970
Look, this is...

1618
01:16:21,970 --> 01:16:22,430
Um...

1619
01:16:22,430 --> 01:16:23,690
This is chicken, like...

1620
01:16:23,690 --> 01:16:24,750
This is...

1621
01:16:24,750 --> 01:16:25,590
Tofu...

1622
01:16:25,590 --> 01:16:26,930
But it's shaped like a chicken.

1623
01:16:27,270 --> 01:16:27,490
Like...

1624
01:16:27,490 --> 01:16:27,710
You know...

1625
01:16:27,710 --> 01:16:28,610
They made like...

1626
01:16:28,610 --> 01:16:29,330
Tofu...

1627
01:16:29,330 --> 01:16:29,850
Chicken...

1628
01:16:29,850 --> 01:16:30,550
And stuff like that.

1629
01:16:31,230 --> 01:16:31,670
And...

1630
01:16:31,670 --> 01:16:34,410
I ate it, and I was like, Oh, this is not for me...

1631
01:16:34,410 --> 01:16:35,310
And I'm really hungry.

1632
01:16:35,390 --> 01:16:35,590
So...

1633
01:16:35,590 --> 01:16:39,290
And I just brought up my chicken burger and just ate it... at the restaurant!

1634
01:16:45,730 --> 01:16:49,770
And then, my teacher... like, I was just like, yum, yum, yum, yum.

1635
01:16:50,050 --> 01:16:53,990
And then, my teacher, like, went up to me and was like, put that away.

1636
01:16:54,330 --> 01:16:55,670
And I was like, what?

1637
01:16:55,830 --> 01:16:56,670
I was so kind.

1638
01:16:56,790 --> 01:16:57,690
Because I didn't know.

1639
01:16:57,870 --> 01:16:58,970
I was so ignorant.

1640
01:16:59,470 --> 01:17:00,770
I didn't know.

1641
01:17:06,570 --> 01:17:09,070
I was the only one that... I was the only kid that did that.

1642
01:17:09,250 --> 01:17:10,170
Because, like...

1643
01:17:10,550 --> 01:17:14,950
I think I was the only one where, like, my parent... like, my mom packed me food, just in case.

1644
01:17:15,710 --> 01:17:16,470
But hungry!

1645
01:17:22,530 --> 01:17:26,890
If a character's grayscale portrait appears, it means you have yet to complete their quest.

1646
01:17:28,690 --> 01:17:31,270
The portrait with the spirit wants their quest to complete.

1647
01:17:32,710 --> 01:17:34,590
Map and fully restore your health.

1648
01:17:34,590 --> 01:17:35,630
Okay.

1649
01:17:36,350 --> 01:17:36,750
Okay.

1650
01:17:36,890 --> 01:17:37,690
Okay, this...

1651
01:17:37,690 --> 01:17:39,330
Okay, so there's block.

1652
01:17:41,110 --> 01:17:42,990
I can have ultra block.

1653
01:17:44,550 --> 01:17:45,750
And then...

1654
01:17:45,750 --> 01:17:47,550
Increases the stack to two.

1655
01:17:48,330 --> 01:17:49,190
What is this?

1656
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:56,300
Okay, I feel like I'm not gonna use...

1657
01:17:56,300 --> 01:17:57,320
Okay, I'm gonna use this.

1658
01:17:57,500 --> 01:17:58,840
The thunderous cleave.

1659
01:17:59,640 --> 01:17:59,960
Yeah.

1660
01:18:01,220 --> 01:18:01,880
There we go.

1661
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:04,280
The four of attack...

1662
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:06,100
It grabs three stacks if it hits an enemy.

1663
01:18:06,260 --> 01:18:07,140
Use to cast spells.

1664
01:18:07,320 --> 01:18:08,640
Okay, we're gonna use the axe.

1665
01:18:08,820 --> 01:18:09,580
Oh my god!

1666
01:18:09,820 --> 01:18:10,220
That...

1667
01:18:10,700 --> 01:18:13,360
I am so intimidated now.

1668
01:18:13,580 --> 01:18:14,060
I...

1669
01:18:15,820 --> 01:18:17,820
What am I looking at?

1670
01:18:18,180 --> 01:18:18,820
What?

1671
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:19,360
What?

1672
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:20,360
What?

1673
01:18:20,360 --> 01:18:21,560
That opened a...

1674
01:18:21,560 --> 01:18:22,060
Like...

1675
01:18:22,060 --> 01:18:22,300
That...

1676
01:18:22,300 --> 01:18:24,240
It just went from level one to like...

1677
01:18:24,240 --> 01:18:24,860
Level...

1678
01:18:24,860 --> 01:18:25,160
50.

1679
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:27,560
Like...

1680
01:18:28,540 --> 01:18:29,140
Oh my god!

1681
01:18:29,140 --> 01:18:29,780
I got the...

1682
01:18:29,780 --> 01:18:30,180
What?

1683
01:18:30,360 --> 01:18:31,120
Oh my god!

1684
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:31,820
Okay.

1685
01:18:32,260 --> 01:18:32,580
I...

1686
01:18:32,580 --> 01:18:34,220
I don't have enough anyway.

1687
01:18:34,460 --> 01:18:36,300
I'll let future Doki handle that.

1688
01:18:38,580 --> 01:18:39,180
Uh...

1689
01:18:42,280 --> 01:18:42,880
Okay.

1690
01:18:44,040 --> 01:18:45,000
I'll let...

1691
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,580
Future Doki can deal with that.

1692
01:18:47,740 --> 01:18:48,000
I...

1693
01:18:48,380 --> 01:18:48,680
I...

1694
01:18:48,680 --> 01:18:50,580
I don't know what I was looking at.

1695
01:18:50,580 --> 01:18:51,360
I...

1696
01:18:53,780 --> 01:18:54,380
I...

1697
01:18:54,380 --> 01:18:57,860
The skill tree just got skill treeed.

1698
01:18:58,480 --> 01:18:59,580
What was the...

1699
01:19:00,780 --> 01:19:01,800
We're in location.

1700
01:19:02,620 --> 01:19:03,640
Buddha Caves.

1701
01:19:03,940 --> 01:19:04,160
Cliffs.

1702
01:19:04,300 --> 01:19:04,980
I mean, that's where I...

1703
01:19:04,980 --> 01:19:05,520
Oh, wait.

1704
01:19:07,420 --> 01:19:08,020
There...

1705
01:19:08,020 --> 01:19:09,820
These are the quests that I have to do.

1706
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:11,640
At that area?

1707
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:13,440
Did I not do the quests already?

1708
01:19:13,900 --> 01:19:14,400
Okay.

1709
01:19:14,440 --> 01:19:15,640
I guess I have to...

1710
01:19:15,640 --> 01:19:16,040
Go...

1711
01:19:16,040 --> 01:19:16,560
Back?

1712
01:19:22,550 --> 01:19:23,230
Okay.

1713
01:19:24,250 --> 01:19:26,350
Apparently there's some quests I haven't done yet.

1714
01:19:27,190 --> 01:19:28,410
How do I...

1715
01:19:30,230 --> 01:19:32,470
I guess like every level I do?

1716
01:19:34,430 --> 01:19:35,110
Yeah.

1717
01:19:37,370 --> 01:19:38,050
Alright.

1718
01:19:38,950 --> 01:19:40,150
It's Groundhog Day.

1719
01:19:42,770 --> 01:19:43,450
Alright.

1720
01:19:43,830 --> 01:19:44,870
Maybe this way?

1721
01:19:46,190 --> 01:19:46,870
Okay.

1722
01:19:46,990 --> 01:19:48,870
This guy seems like really tough though.

1723
01:19:49,450 --> 01:19:51,130
Like he seems like...

1724
01:19:51,130 --> 01:19:52,070
He really did not...

1725
01:19:52,070 --> 01:19:53,070
Does not want me there.

1726
01:19:53,250 --> 01:19:54,710
So maybe I shouldn't go that way.

1727
01:19:55,750 --> 01:19:56,270
Okay.

1728
01:19:56,970 --> 01:19:57,490
But...

1729
01:19:57,490 --> 01:19:58,870
I didn't go left though.

1730
01:19:59,010 --> 01:20:00,310
I went right instead of left.

1731
01:20:00,830 --> 01:20:01,870
So maybe...

1732
01:20:05,750 --> 01:20:06,270
Okay.

1733
01:20:07,130 --> 01:20:07,650
Speed!

1734
01:20:08,750 --> 01:20:09,670
Oh shit!

1735
01:20:11,710 --> 01:20:12,230
Okay.

1736
01:20:12,330 --> 01:20:12,610
Give me a sec.

1737
01:20:12,710 --> 01:20:13,270
I'm a little EP.

1738
01:20:14,170 --> 01:20:14,690
Okay.

1739
01:20:15,190 --> 01:20:15,630
Guess not.

1740
01:20:16,030 --> 01:20:16,930
Oh my god.

1741
01:20:17,010 --> 01:20:18,210
He just stabs me like that.

1742
01:20:20,710 --> 01:20:21,190
Okay.

1743
01:20:21,290 --> 01:20:21,590
There we go.

1744
01:20:23,050 --> 01:20:23,290
Alright.

1745
01:20:26,130 --> 01:20:27,090
Beyblade time.

1746
01:20:28,690 --> 01:20:30,670
I had to do a little spin-y spin.

1747
01:20:30,930 --> 01:20:31,050
Okay.

1748
01:20:31,150 --> 01:20:32,230
So I didn't go left.

1749
01:20:32,590 --> 01:20:34,270
Maybe that's where I get my quest.

1750
01:20:34,950 --> 01:20:37,670
I like that on my top right there's a little guy just running.

1751
01:20:38,370 --> 01:20:40,150
I don't know what that means.

1752
01:20:40,570 --> 01:20:42,170
But I like his style.

1753
01:20:42,170 --> 01:20:42,890
Okay.

1754
01:20:43,070 --> 01:20:43,690
So it was...

1755
01:20:43,690 --> 01:20:44,710
Oh, it's just a dead end.

1756
01:20:45,210 --> 01:20:46,350
Is there really just a dead end?

1757
01:20:47,570 --> 01:20:49,170
I have to like remember that...

1758
01:20:49,710 --> 01:20:50,630
Is there parrying?

1759
01:20:51,190 --> 01:20:52,770
Well, there is a block.

1760
01:20:52,930 --> 01:20:54,110
But they said like...

1761
01:20:54,110 --> 01:20:54,790
They were saying like...

1762
01:20:54,790 --> 01:20:57,110
Oh, it doesn't give that much of an advantage.

1763
01:20:57,430 --> 01:20:57,730
Like...

1764
01:20:57,730 --> 01:20:58,670
It doesn't do much.

1765
01:20:58,970 --> 01:20:59,370
But...

1766
01:20:59,370 --> 01:21:00,370
Maybe I...

1767
01:21:00,370 --> 01:21:01,750
Maybe I'm just not doing it right.

1768
01:21:04,390 --> 01:21:05,230
Alright.

1769
01:21:05,230 --> 01:21:05,310
Okay.

1770
01:21:06,510 --> 01:21:07,350
Apparently...

1771
01:21:07,350 --> 01:21:09,290
I also don't like water.

1772
01:21:14,840 --> 01:21:16,140
Also some...

1773
01:21:16,140 --> 01:21:17,700
Only some weapons have parry.

1774
01:21:17,960 --> 01:21:18,580
Because like...

1775
01:21:18,580 --> 01:21:19,840
The sword doesn't...

1776
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:20,160
Alright.

1777
01:21:20,280 --> 01:21:21,040
Apparently...

1778
01:21:21,040 --> 01:21:23,320
When you have the feathering...

1779
01:21:23,320 --> 01:21:24,480
Water bad.

1780
01:21:26,640 --> 01:21:27,480
Water.

1781
01:21:27,860 --> 01:21:28,800
It's scary.

1782
01:21:29,220 --> 01:21:31,620
Because I'm the wrong type of bird.

1783
01:21:31,620 --> 01:21:32,340
Apparently.

1784
01:21:33,460 --> 01:21:34,340
Which is...

1785
01:21:35,460 --> 01:21:35,900
Understandable.

1786
01:21:37,660 --> 01:21:38,560
What the fuck?

1787
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:39,420
That should've hit.

1788
01:21:41,560 --> 01:21:42,000
Alright.

1789
01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:43,460
Well, that's good to know.

1790
01:21:43,640 --> 01:21:44,440
That's good to know.

1791
01:21:44,640 --> 01:21:45,480
Water bad.

1792
01:21:52,660 --> 01:21:54,440
Let's grab this guy out first.

1793
01:21:55,280 --> 01:21:55,700
Okay.

1794
01:21:55,700 --> 01:21:56,640
Get out of here.

1795
01:21:57,120 --> 01:21:57,740
Oh, wait.

1796
01:21:57,820 --> 01:21:58,180
He's dead.

1797
01:21:58,380 --> 01:21:58,760
Okay, nice.

1798
01:21:58,840 --> 01:21:59,820
He did get out of here.

1799
01:21:59,820 --> 01:22:00,880
Uh...

1800
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:03,040
I slipped and then...

1801
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:03,600
I died.

1802
01:22:04,260 --> 01:22:04,800
That's...

1803
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:05,260
You know what?

1804
01:22:05,260 --> 01:22:06,280
That's good to know.

1805
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:06,860
That's...

1806
01:22:06,860 --> 01:22:08,180
I needed to know...

1807
01:22:08,180 --> 01:22:10,020
Know the dangers of water.

1808
01:22:10,760 --> 01:22:11,320
Hehehehe.

1809
01:22:12,500 --> 01:22:13,380
Cause they're like...

1810
01:22:13,380 --> 01:22:14,900
I have two quests here.

1811
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:16,060
That I have yet to do.

1812
01:22:16,320 --> 01:22:17,020
So I'm like...

1813
01:22:17,020 --> 01:22:17,340
Wondering.

1814
01:22:17,340 --> 01:22:18,120
Where do I go?

1815
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:22,880
Okay.

1816
01:22:26,530 --> 01:22:27,090
Okay.

1817
01:22:27,390 --> 01:22:28,070
I guess...

1818
01:22:28,070 --> 01:22:30,050
I didn't have to go there then?

1819
01:22:30,370 --> 01:22:31,370
I guess I'll go back.

1820
01:22:31,470 --> 01:22:31,910
Cause...

1821
01:22:31,910 --> 01:22:33,230
I went everywhere this way.

1822
01:22:33,450 --> 01:22:34,750
So I'm just gonna go back then.

1823
01:22:36,510 --> 01:22:38,250
Maybe fight the Armored Man.

1824
01:22:38,470 --> 01:22:39,710
But the Armored Man's scary.

1825
01:22:40,150 --> 01:22:40,410
Alright.

1826
01:22:40,410 --> 01:22:41,310
Hahahaha.

1827
01:22:42,090 --> 01:22:42,710
Hahahaha.

1828
01:22:43,670 --> 01:22:44,270
Hahahaha.

1829
01:22:44,790 --> 01:22:44,990
Hahahaha.

1830
01:22:44,990 --> 01:22:47,070
But he looks so scary, guys.

1831
01:22:50,410 --> 01:22:51,030
Alright.

1832
01:22:51,290 --> 01:22:52,630
We'll fight the Armored Man.

1833
01:22:56,560 --> 01:22:57,440
Wait, what?

1834
01:22:57,600 --> 01:22:58,540
There's a child here.

1835
01:23:03,750 --> 01:23:04,850
Where's the child?

1836
01:23:07,030 --> 01:23:08,810
Wait, we all heard the child.

1837
01:23:15,330 --> 01:23:16,330
Oh, it's the sound guy.

1838
01:23:16,490 --> 01:23:16,890
Did you...

1839
01:23:16,890 --> 01:23:17,830
Is everything...

1840
01:23:17,830 --> 01:23:18,230
Okay?

1841
01:23:18,730 --> 01:23:19,730
Oh, there he is!

1842
01:23:19,890 --> 01:23:21,390
Wait, how do I get to this child?

1843
01:23:24,830 --> 01:23:25,950
Wait, I can't jump!

1844
01:23:26,230 --> 01:23:26,890
There's a child!

1845
01:23:27,130 --> 01:23:27,930
Literally right there!

1846
01:23:33,420 --> 01:23:35,060
Yeah, I can't get there at all.

1847
01:23:40,550 --> 01:23:41,210
Oh my god.

1848
01:23:41,290 --> 01:23:43,370
It's so weird not being able to jump though.

1849
01:23:45,130 --> 01:23:45,910
He's right there!

1850
01:23:46,030 --> 01:23:47,190
He's literally right there!

1851
01:23:48,170 --> 01:23:48,570
Look!

1852
01:23:48,670 --> 01:23:48,870
See?

1853
01:23:49,990 --> 01:23:51,210
It's a child!

1854
01:23:51,690 --> 01:23:53,390
It's a child!

1855
01:23:53,750 --> 01:23:55,410
But I can't get there.

1856
01:23:55,730 --> 01:23:55,870
Right?

1857
01:23:56,090 --> 01:23:56,690
I can't...

1858
01:23:56,690 --> 01:23:58,350
Apparently, I don't...

1859
01:23:58,350 --> 01:24:03,010
I don't have the fucking leg strength to do any jumps right now.

1860
01:24:05,530 --> 01:24:07,670
Alright, we'll fight the Armor guy.

1861
01:24:07,970 --> 01:24:09,050
We'll see how this goes.

1862
01:24:10,730 --> 01:24:12,630
Guys, he has a lot of HP.

1863
01:24:13,130 --> 01:24:13,350
Guys.

1864
01:24:13,670 --> 01:24:16,190
I don't think that's gonna go well for me.

1865
01:24:16,190 --> 01:24:16,770
Hehehehe.

1866
01:24:17,250 --> 01:24:17,850
Hehehehe.

1867
01:24:17,850 --> 01:24:18,290
Hehehehe.

1868
01:24:20,450 --> 01:24:22,690
Oh my god, okay.

1869
01:24:23,230 --> 01:24:24,790
Okay, it is doable.

1870
01:24:25,090 --> 01:24:25,850
It is doable.

1871
01:24:26,210 --> 01:24:26,970
But he...

1872
01:24:26,970 --> 01:24:29,010
Yeah, he does have a lot of HP.

1873
01:24:31,850 --> 01:24:32,570
Okay.

1874
01:24:36,470 --> 01:24:37,490
Okay, nice.

1875
01:24:40,050 --> 01:24:40,770
Okay.

1876
01:24:41,450 --> 01:24:42,510
I understand.

1877
01:24:46,650 --> 01:24:47,170
Nice.

1878
01:24:47,430 --> 01:24:47,470
Nice.

1879
01:24:47,470 --> 01:24:47,610
Alright.

1880
01:24:48,110 --> 01:24:49,010
It's not as bad.

1881
01:24:49,210 --> 01:24:49,950
It's not as bad.

1882
01:24:50,230 --> 01:24:52,710
And then I realized I still can't open it.

1883
01:24:53,090 --> 01:24:53,670
And then...

1884
01:24:55,910 --> 01:24:56,810
What's the point?

1885
01:24:56,910 --> 01:24:59,450
What's the point of guarding a door that's locked?

1886
01:25:03,490 --> 01:25:05,350
Like, what is your purpose?

1887
01:25:05,610 --> 01:25:07,010
I can't even go through.

1888
01:25:07,590 --> 01:25:08,270
I...

1889
01:25:08,270 --> 01:25:08,830
What?

1890
01:25:09,550 --> 01:25:10,050
Right...

1891
01:25:10,050 --> 01:25:11,490
Right on.

1892
01:25:14,290 --> 01:25:16,090
I got him.

1893
01:25:16,890 --> 01:25:17,150
Alright.

1894
01:25:17,350 --> 01:25:18,090
Then I leave.

1895
01:25:18,330 --> 01:25:19,410
I can't even...

1896
01:25:19,410 --> 01:25:21,030
In case you open it.

1897
01:25:23,290 --> 01:25:26,130
He's a two-factor authentication.

1898
01:25:26,810 --> 01:25:27,490
I...

1899
01:25:27,490 --> 01:25:30,290
Goddamn two-factor authentication.

1900
01:25:30,290 --> 01:25:31,370
Am I right?

1901
01:25:32,170 --> 01:25:32,510
Okay.

1902
01:25:32,650 --> 01:25:34,230
Now I gotta figure this out.

1903
01:25:34,630 --> 01:25:34,790
Alright.

1904
01:25:35,550 --> 01:25:35,930
Okay.

1905
01:25:37,110 --> 01:25:37,750
Fuck.

1906
01:25:38,010 --> 01:25:38,210
Okay.

1907
01:25:39,690 --> 01:25:40,130
Okay.

1908
01:25:42,810 --> 01:25:43,250
Um...

1909
01:25:45,970 --> 01:25:46,410
Charges...

1910
01:25:47,190 --> 01:25:47,630
Plus...

1911
01:25:47,630 --> 01:25:48,030
Okay.

1912
01:25:48,050 --> 01:25:48,630
I do not have enough.

1913
01:25:48,830 --> 01:25:48,950
Okay.

1914
01:25:48,990 --> 01:25:49,530
I don't have enough.

1915
01:25:49,610 --> 01:25:49,710
Okay.

1916
01:25:49,750 --> 01:25:50,890
I don't have to figure this out.

1917
01:25:51,090 --> 01:25:51,470
I...

1918
01:25:51,470 --> 01:25:51,870
I...

1919
01:25:51,870 --> 01:25:54,370
I don't have to figure this out yet.

1920
01:25:54,730 --> 01:25:55,530
Thank God.

1921
01:26:03,800 --> 01:26:04,500
It's fine.

1922
01:26:04,500 --> 01:26:06,280
I don't have to figure this out yet.

1923
01:26:08,520 --> 01:26:09,500
One new item?

1924
01:26:09,780 --> 01:26:10,420
One new item.

1925
01:26:10,860 --> 01:26:11,420
One thing I got.

1926
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:12,020
Any item?

1927
01:26:14,180 --> 01:26:14,700
Blast.

1928
01:26:14,860 --> 01:26:15,620
Enter your dream.

1929
01:26:15,860 --> 01:26:16,920
Restorer's HP.

1930
01:26:17,180 --> 01:26:18,200
There's so many.

1931
01:26:18,360 --> 01:26:18,540
Okay.

1932
01:26:19,020 --> 01:26:21,840
Oh, so these are the... these are like the little runes that I can do.

1933
01:26:24,120 --> 01:26:24,640
Alright.

1934
01:26:26,320 --> 01:26:26,840
Um...

1935
01:26:27,960 --> 01:26:29,920
Where do I go up here?

1936
01:26:35,740 --> 01:26:36,780
No one...

1937
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:39,480
Hello?

1938
01:26:45,960 --> 01:26:47,920
What other pathway could I take?

1939
01:26:48,100 --> 01:26:48,740
A ladder?

1940
01:26:48,960 --> 01:26:49,680
No, that's...

1941
01:26:49,680 --> 01:26:51,280
Oh, is it the ladder?

1942
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:54,720
It's the ladder.

1943
01:26:55,100 --> 01:26:56,080
It's a different area.

1944
01:26:56,360 --> 01:26:57,140
I'm pretty sure.

1945
01:26:58,680 --> 01:26:59,120
Alright.

1946
01:26:59,620 --> 01:27:00,340
Okay, nice.

1947
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:05,000
Okay.

1948
01:27:05,540 --> 01:27:06,840
Yeah, it's a different area.

1949
01:27:07,100 --> 01:27:07,820
Okay, that's good.

1950
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:10,880
I thought it would be like a shortcut.

1951
01:27:11,040 --> 01:27:13,420
It's usually, you know, when you kick down the ladder, it's the shortcut.

1952
01:27:14,080 --> 01:27:15,560
There's a lot of dead people here.

1953
01:27:17,780 --> 01:27:19,040
Oh, I have a spell!

1954
01:27:22,220 --> 01:27:22,660
Oh!

1955
01:27:23,300 --> 01:27:23,740
Cool!

1956
01:27:25,800 --> 01:27:26,920
Equip spells?

1957
01:27:30,080 --> 01:27:33,400
A spell known putting out to subdue ordinary demons.

1958
01:27:33,660 --> 01:27:35,520
It's simple as even cast it.

1959
01:27:35,660 --> 01:27:38,240
Unleaves a blade that deals magic damage.

1960
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:40,760
Okay, so why is the spell?

1961
01:27:40,980 --> 01:27:42,460
Where's my spell meter?

1962
01:27:44,040 --> 01:27:44,940
Oh shit!

1963
01:27:45,800 --> 01:27:46,360
Why?

1964
01:27:49,320 --> 01:27:51,400
What does my spell meter do?

1965
01:27:52,160 --> 01:27:53,260
Oh shit, sorry.

1966
01:27:53,340 --> 01:27:55,760
I was like looking at my... trying to find the spell meter.

1967
01:27:59,060 --> 01:27:59,620
Okay.

1968
01:27:59,620 --> 01:28:01,000
Is English my second language?

1969
01:28:05,780 --> 01:28:07,260
What the fuck?!

1970
01:28:07,260 --> 01:28:07,900
Oh my god!

1971
01:28:08,920 --> 01:28:09,480
Okay.

1972
01:28:09,760 --> 01:28:10,220
Okay.

1973
01:28:10,460 --> 01:28:10,580
How?

1974
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:12,500
Get the fuck off me!

1975
01:28:13,200 --> 01:28:16,800
Okay, you know I'm glad I killed your defense lift goblins later, last time.

1976
01:28:19,860 --> 01:28:20,620
Okay.

1977
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:22,080
Okay, I was trying to figure out...

1978
01:28:23,620 --> 01:28:24,000
Wait.

1979
01:28:25,220 --> 01:28:25,980
What?

1980
01:28:27,420 --> 01:28:28,180
Oh!

1981
01:28:28,860 --> 01:28:31,020
I have to find it!

1982
01:28:31,200 --> 01:28:31,360
Okay.

1983
01:28:33,800 --> 01:28:34,820
I'm glad.

1984
01:28:35,200 --> 01:28:35,980
I'm glad.

1985
01:28:36,180 --> 01:28:37,540
I'm glad I killed your family earlier.

1986
01:28:37,540 --> 01:28:38,620
They were defenseless.

1987
01:28:42,680 --> 01:28:43,070
Alright.

1988
01:28:46,270 --> 01:28:49,230
So the spell is like, one use?

1989
01:28:49,990 --> 01:28:50,550
And...

1990
01:28:50,970 --> 01:28:52,610
Like, this is what restores it.

1991
01:28:52,610 --> 01:28:54,570
So when they're flying away...

1992
01:28:55,270 --> 01:28:56,110
I think?

1993
01:29:02,970 --> 01:29:05,330
I'm like learning about this as I go along.

1994
01:29:06,070 --> 01:29:12,870
Lock on to light attack while performing a plantless triggers and obliterate strike when successful against small to medium.

1995
01:29:13,630 --> 01:29:14,190
Okay.

1996
01:29:14,550 --> 01:29:15,170
I have to...

1997
01:29:15,170 --> 01:29:15,970
Oh, that's cool.

1998
01:29:16,310 --> 01:29:17,330
That's a cool move.

1999
01:29:17,970 --> 01:29:19,150
Can I make it?

2000
01:29:23,430 --> 01:29:24,650
Guys, I...

2001
01:29:24,650 --> 01:29:25,570
Okay, there...

2002
01:29:25,570 --> 01:29:26,890
Don't, don't, don't...

2003
01:29:28,970 --> 01:29:31,090
Guys, I don't think I made it.

2004
01:29:31,270 --> 01:29:33,650
I don't think I made it.

2005
01:29:34,170 --> 01:29:35,370
I don't think I made it.

2006
01:29:37,630 --> 01:29:38,730
I got...

2007
01:29:39,550 --> 01:29:41,450
Instructions unclear, apparently.

2008
01:29:43,450 --> 01:29:45,810
No, I can't even get the item!

2009
01:29:52,300 --> 01:29:52,860
Okay.

2010
01:29:52,900 --> 01:29:53,920
Okay, so there is back stab.

2011
01:29:55,040 --> 01:29:56,200
That's good to know.

2012
01:29:56,700 --> 01:30:00,240
Also, he was very injured and I might have just...

2013
01:30:01,240 --> 01:30:02,360
Oh, I...

2014
01:30:02,360 --> 01:30:04,520
Oh, I might have just...

2015
01:30:04,520 --> 01:30:05,580
Oh, wait.

2016
01:30:05,800 --> 01:30:07,520
I think this guy was a doctor.

2017
01:30:07,800 --> 01:30:11,020
And he was trying to help these people.

2018
01:30:11,320 --> 01:30:13,240
Oh, I might have...

2019
01:30:13,240 --> 01:30:15,900
I might have committed a crime.

2020
01:30:16,360 --> 01:30:16,760
I...

2021
01:30:17,540 --> 01:30:18,520
You know what?

2022
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:19,120
It's too...

2023
01:30:19,120 --> 01:30:20,960
I'm too far gone now.

2024
01:30:21,280 --> 01:30:21,680
I...

2025
01:30:21,680 --> 01:30:22,040
I...

2026
01:30:22,040 --> 01:30:22,840
I...

2027
01:30:24,180 --> 01:30:26,280
Might as well fully commit.

2028
01:30:26,680 --> 01:30:29,180
I might have made a terrible mistake.

2029
01:30:33,740 --> 01:30:36,780
Why did you kill those innocent monks?

2030
01:30:37,400 --> 01:30:37,820
Uh...

2031
01:30:37,820 --> 01:30:39,040
No witnesses.

2032
01:30:39,240 --> 01:30:39,580
You're right.

2033
01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:41,440
No witnesses, guys.

2034
01:30:45,800 --> 01:30:46,200
Uh...

2035
01:30:50,720 --> 01:30:51,520
Okay, so...

2036
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:52,620
Well, let's do position in front.

2037
01:30:53,620 --> 01:30:54,020
And...

2038
01:30:54,020 --> 01:30:55,760
Or behind them and execute a light attack.

2039
01:30:55,980 --> 01:30:56,140
Okay.

2040
01:30:58,280 --> 01:30:58,680
Okay.

2041
01:30:59,120 --> 01:30:59,420
Okay.

2042
01:30:59,420 --> 01:31:02,260
Okay, so if they're doing that, I have to use a light attack on them.

2043
01:31:02,380 --> 01:31:03,300
Okay, that's good to know.

2044
01:31:03,300 --> 01:31:04,300
Alright, I believe...

2045
01:31:05,440 --> 01:31:07,340
I believe that's our boss.

2046
01:31:08,440 --> 01:31:09,400
Okay, she'll...

2047
01:31:09,400 --> 01:31:10,760
Clearly she'll drop down.

2048
01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:12,500
Wait, actually, let me heal real fast.

2049
01:31:16,780 --> 01:31:17,500
What the fuck?

2050
01:31:18,360 --> 01:31:18,840
Nice.

2051
01:31:20,920 --> 01:31:22,240
Okay, is that...

2052
01:31:22,240 --> 01:31:22,640
I assume...

2053
01:31:22,640 --> 01:31:23,440
Oh yeah, that is.

2054
01:31:24,640 --> 01:31:24,960
Okay.

2055
01:31:29,060 --> 01:31:30,200
Alright, that's good to know.

2056
01:31:30,340 --> 01:31:30,760
Watch this.

2057
01:31:34,900 --> 01:31:36,400
Oh, I couldn't do...

2058
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:36,580
Wait.

2059
01:31:36,820 --> 01:31:37,720
I can abuse that.

2060
01:31:37,940 --> 01:31:39,200
Wait, I can actually abuse that.

2061
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:40,600
But...

2062
01:31:40,600 --> 01:31:41,680
Wait.

2063
01:31:42,160 --> 01:31:42,600
Wait.

2064
01:31:42,920 --> 01:31:43,960
Wait a minute.

2065
01:31:46,500 --> 01:31:47,100
Wait.

2066
01:31:47,560 --> 01:31:48,060
Okay, guys.

2067
01:31:48,180 --> 01:31:49,240
Wait, this is actually perfect.

2068
01:31:49,700 --> 01:31:50,280
I...

2069
01:31:50,280 --> 01:31:51,280
Technically, that's a high ground.

2070
01:31:54,760 --> 01:31:55,640
Oh shit.

2071
01:31:57,580 --> 01:32:00,080
This is why you can't jump.

2072
01:32:00,760 --> 01:32:01,900
This is...

2073
01:32:01,900 --> 01:32:03,240
Not the cheese.

2074
01:32:03,680 --> 01:32:04,360
Yeah, dude.

2075
01:32:04,540 --> 01:32:05,660
I was just elevated.

2076
01:32:05,880 --> 01:32:07,120
Just a little bit.

2077
01:32:07,560 --> 01:32:08,440
And it counted.

2078
01:32:08,940 --> 01:32:10,600
Comes in three types.

2079
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:12,060
Oaths, wisdom, and memory.

2080
01:32:12,220 --> 01:32:12,760
You can socket...

2081
01:32:13,660 --> 01:32:16,820
Benedictions onto weapons or remove them at shrines.

2082
01:32:17,740 --> 01:32:19,740
Benediction greatly increases your...

2083
01:32:19,740 --> 01:32:23,620
Okay, so they also have little rocks that I can put...

2084
01:32:23,620 --> 01:32:26,420
Might reduce damage taken for time.

2085
01:32:26,740 --> 01:32:26,860
Okay.

2086
01:32:27,300 --> 01:32:28,100
That's cool.

2087
01:32:28,640 --> 01:32:29,320
Okay.

2088
01:32:31,900 --> 01:32:33,100
Pure skill.

2089
01:32:35,320 --> 01:32:37,940
That's why I can't jump, guys.

2090
01:32:42,060 --> 01:32:42,660
Alright.

2091
01:32:44,260 --> 01:32:45,600
I found the cheese.

2092
01:32:45,820 --> 01:32:46,900
I just gotta be like...

2093
01:32:46,900 --> 01:32:48,720
A little bit higher than them.

2094
01:32:48,920 --> 01:32:50,200
And just drop down.

2095
01:32:51,360 --> 01:32:52,760
Oh nice, this is chest.

2096
01:32:56,700 --> 01:32:57,780
What did I get?

2097
01:32:58,840 --> 01:33:00,060
Forgotten remembrance?

2098
01:33:00,420 --> 01:33:01,060
What is that?

2099
01:33:05,200 --> 01:33:06,200
What even...

2100
01:33:06,200 --> 01:33:07,700
What even is that for?

2101
01:33:12,610 --> 01:33:13,310
What?

2102
01:33:18,350 --> 01:33:19,650
Didn't say anything.

2103
01:33:21,070 --> 01:33:22,090
A remembrance...

2104
01:33:22,090 --> 01:33:22,650
Actually...

2105
01:33:22,650 --> 01:33:24,130
A remembrance that was forgotten.

2106
01:33:26,990 --> 01:33:27,710
Okay.

2107
01:33:30,470 --> 01:33:31,090
Oh my god.

2108
01:33:31,150 --> 01:33:31,870
Do I have to backtrack?

2109
01:33:39,110 --> 01:33:40,750
Where do I go after that?

2110
01:33:42,870 --> 01:33:43,390
Oh.

2111
01:33:43,490 --> 01:33:44,830
Is there like a pathway over here?

2112
01:33:45,210 --> 01:33:46,010
Oh, there was.

2113
01:33:46,890 --> 01:33:47,290
Oh.

2114
01:33:47,590 --> 01:33:48,370
There is.

2115
01:33:48,650 --> 01:33:49,150
Okay, nice.

2116
01:33:50,130 --> 01:33:51,370
There was a pathway over here.

2117
01:33:51,490 --> 01:33:52,370
And there's an item too.

2118
01:33:56,930 --> 01:33:57,450
Okay.

2119
01:33:57,450 --> 01:33:57,490
Okay.

2120
01:34:00,170 --> 01:34:01,190
That's good to know.

2121
01:34:02,590 --> 01:34:03,090
Whoa!

2122
01:34:04,210 --> 01:34:04,550
Hahaha.

2123
01:34:05,490 --> 01:34:05,850
That's right.

2124
01:34:05,970 --> 01:34:07,610
You missed the wrong...

2125
01:34:07,610 --> 01:34:08,850
The wrong woman.

2126
01:34:09,590 --> 01:34:10,430
That's right.

2127
01:34:10,430 --> 01:34:11,350
Get out of here.

2128
01:34:16,610 --> 01:34:17,290
Alright.

2129
01:34:17,450 --> 01:34:18,650
We'll get rid of this guy too.

2130
01:34:24,150 --> 01:34:24,830
Chop?

2131
01:34:26,530 --> 01:34:27,210
Alright.

2132
01:34:27,990 --> 01:34:29,630
A faint red feather.

2133
01:34:31,610 --> 01:34:32,150
What's this?

2134
01:34:32,270 --> 01:34:32,950
This is also a feather?

2135
01:34:34,630 --> 01:34:35,430
Lost package.

2136
01:34:35,690 --> 01:34:35,770
Oh.

2137
01:34:35,830 --> 01:34:37,050
There might be quest items?

2138
01:34:39,810 --> 01:34:40,210
Maybe?

2139
01:34:41,650 --> 01:34:43,490
I could drop down from here.

2140
01:34:43,690 --> 01:34:44,510
He's just sleeping.

2141
01:34:45,310 --> 01:34:47,650
But there might be other people I could have to kill here.

2142
01:34:47,990 --> 01:34:48,250
Okay.

2143
01:34:49,150 --> 01:34:49,550
Alright.

2144
01:34:49,690 --> 01:34:50,930
How do I go back?

2145
01:34:51,210 --> 01:34:51,450
Okay.

2146
01:34:51,790 --> 01:34:52,110
You know what?

2147
01:34:52,150 --> 01:34:52,230
Yeah.

2148
01:34:52,290 --> 01:34:53,190
I'll kill the sleeping guy.

2149
01:34:55,830 --> 01:34:56,350
Fuck it.

2150
01:34:56,510 --> 01:34:57,350
I'm already in too deep.

2151
01:34:59,510 --> 01:34:59,910
Okay.

2152
01:35:02,190 --> 01:35:03,130
Oh shit.

2153
01:35:03,390 --> 01:35:03,970
Oh shit.

2154
01:35:04,190 --> 01:35:05,030
Oh shit.

2155
01:35:05,110 --> 01:35:05,970
I made a noise.

2156
01:35:06,230 --> 01:35:06,710
Whoops.

2157
01:35:07,490 --> 01:35:08,170
It's alright.

2158
01:35:08,370 --> 01:35:08,990
It still works.

2159
01:35:09,390 --> 01:35:10,710
I'm already in too deep.

2160
01:35:11,770 --> 01:35:12,390
Alright.

2161
01:35:16,610 --> 01:35:17,230
Alright.

2162
01:35:17,530 --> 01:35:18,490
Flying dagger.

2163
01:35:23,230 --> 01:35:24,230
Oh nice.

2164
01:35:24,430 --> 01:35:24,890
What's this?

2165
01:35:26,710 --> 01:35:27,330
Airplane.

2166
01:35:27,330 --> 01:35:27,690
Oh.

2167
01:35:27,810 --> 01:35:28,630
Delicate armor.

2168
01:35:29,070 --> 01:35:29,330
Okay.

2169
01:35:29,490 --> 01:35:29,790
I...

2170
01:35:29,790 --> 01:35:30,710
Okay.

2171
01:35:30,710 --> 01:35:31,670
I was gonna say...

2172
01:35:31,670 --> 01:35:31,830
Oh.

2173
01:35:31,930 --> 01:35:32,610
It gives me...

2174
01:35:32,610 --> 01:35:32,730
Oh.

2175
01:35:32,790 --> 01:35:34,210
This is like a magic build.

2176
01:35:35,830 --> 01:35:36,310
Yeah.

2177
01:35:36,350 --> 01:35:36,930
That's a...

2178
01:35:36,930 --> 01:35:37,690
Yeah.

2179
01:35:37,770 --> 01:35:38,030
No.

2180
01:35:38,570 --> 01:35:39,870
I was like...

2181
01:35:39,870 --> 01:35:40,150
Hmm.

2182
01:35:40,150 --> 01:35:41,490
A delicate leggings.

2183
01:35:41,850 --> 01:35:42,530
A delicate...

2184
01:35:42,530 --> 01:35:42,650
A delicate...

2185
01:35:42,650 --> 01:35:44,510
Would this armor be better?

2186
01:35:45,050 --> 01:35:46,210
Ha ha ha ha ha.

2187
01:35:46,870 --> 01:35:48,550
I wonder...

2188
01:35:49,010 --> 01:35:51,870
I wonder if this armor would make me stronger.

2189
01:35:56,220 --> 01:35:56,820
Oh shit.

2190
01:35:57,120 --> 01:35:57,780
Okay guys.

2191
01:35:57,900 --> 01:35:59,540
I will show you after I kill these men.

2192
01:36:02,140 --> 01:36:02,500
Boom.

2193
01:36:02,720 --> 01:36:03,520
What the fuck was...

2194
01:36:03,520 --> 01:36:04,500
What was that?

2195
01:36:04,680 --> 01:36:04,800
Huh?

2196
01:36:05,580 --> 01:36:06,340
What was that?

2197
01:36:08,120 --> 01:36:08,480
Okay.

2198
01:36:08,560 --> 01:36:09,740
I wanna get the...

2199
01:36:11,280 --> 01:36:11,640
Okay.

2200
01:36:11,720 --> 01:36:13,140
He like does dashes and stuff.

2201
01:36:13,240 --> 01:36:13,960
So it fucks with me.

2202
01:36:14,460 --> 01:36:14,760
Come on.

2203
01:36:14,980 --> 01:36:15,400
Trick me.

2204
01:36:16,340 --> 01:36:17,380
Oh my god.

2205
01:36:17,580 --> 01:36:19,660
The speed for it is like...

2206
01:36:20,680 --> 01:36:22,180
It like fucks with me a little.

2207
01:36:24,900 --> 01:36:25,660
There you go.

2208
01:36:25,940 --> 01:36:26,220
Oh wait.

2209
01:36:26,260 --> 01:36:27,020
That hits me?

2210
01:36:29,300 --> 01:36:29,780
Okay.

2211
01:36:31,040 --> 01:36:31,520
Alright.

2212
01:36:33,440 --> 01:36:34,440
What is this?

2213
01:36:35,060 --> 01:36:35,320
Oh.

2214
01:36:35,700 --> 01:36:36,300
Leg wraps.

2215
01:36:36,860 --> 01:36:37,120
Okay.

2216
01:36:37,200 --> 01:36:38,000
Is this better though?

2217
01:36:39,580 --> 01:36:41,440
I have less feathery magic.

2218
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:42,120
But it's that...

2219
01:36:42,120 --> 01:36:42,280
Okay.

2220
01:36:42,320 --> 01:36:43,960
I'll show you guys what it looks like.

2221
01:36:46,260 --> 01:36:46,780
Ooh.

2222
01:36:46,940 --> 01:36:47,380
I'm...

2223
01:37:07,340 --> 01:37:08,380
Lucky respect.

2224
01:37:11,320 --> 01:37:11,840
Okay.

2225
01:37:11,900 --> 01:37:13,400
I'll give you...

2226
01:37:13,400 --> 01:37:13,620
Wait.

2227
01:37:13,800 --> 01:37:14,540
Red tassel spear.

2228
01:37:16,280 --> 01:37:16,820
Um.

2229
01:37:17,560 --> 01:37:18,900
Maybe I like the spear more.

2230
01:37:19,880 --> 01:37:20,780
Is the spear better?

2231
01:37:27,310 --> 01:37:27,850
Okay.

2232
01:37:28,110 --> 01:37:29,090
Do it again.

2233
01:37:29,230 --> 01:37:29,410
Okay.

2234
01:37:29,570 --> 01:37:31,610
I'll just put this thing on.

2235
01:37:34,490 --> 01:37:36,690
I was not expecting it.

2236
01:37:38,790 --> 01:37:39,690
Oh my gosh.

2237
01:37:39,810 --> 01:37:41,170
Why do I have red eyes?

2238
01:37:41,370 --> 01:37:43,330
What the fuck is wrong with me?

2239
01:38:06,290 --> 01:38:08,290
What the fuck?

2240
01:38:08,450 --> 01:38:08,490
What the fuck?

2241
01:38:08,490 --> 01:38:09,410
He has a gun?

2242
01:38:11,050 --> 01:38:12,550
What the fuck?

2243
01:38:12,550 --> 01:38:13,130
He has a gun?

2244
01:38:13,950 --> 01:38:17,090
Why does he have a fucking gun?

2245
01:38:19,190 --> 01:38:20,610
Jingle jingle.

2246
01:38:21,310 --> 01:38:24,970
Okay, how do I time a gunshot?

2247
01:38:27,090 --> 01:38:28,870
Okay, that was bullshit.

2248
01:38:29,110 --> 01:38:30,950
Like, how the fuck do I time that?

2249
01:38:31,690 --> 01:38:32,790
That's cheating.

2250
01:38:36,950 --> 01:38:39,570
I was not expecting a gun.

2251
01:38:41,470 --> 01:38:43,110
Randomly in my Souls game.

2252
01:38:45,230 --> 01:38:46,930
There was no pattern!

2253
01:38:48,890 --> 01:38:49,990
What the fuck?

2254
01:38:50,250 --> 01:38:51,930
Let me steal this real fast.

2255
01:38:53,670 --> 01:38:56,050
Okay, that was cheeky.

2256
01:38:56,270 --> 01:38:57,610
I just think I have ears.

2257
01:39:02,830 --> 01:39:04,110
What the fuck?

2258
01:39:07,710 --> 01:39:08,410
What?

2259
01:39:12,450 --> 01:39:14,330
Okay, that's not fair.

2260
01:39:15,210 --> 01:39:17,410
Oh my god, that is not fair.

2261
01:39:17,530 --> 01:39:22,150
Okay, I didn't realize that it can... I didn't realize it does that.

2262
01:39:25,970 --> 01:39:26,530
Okay.

2263
01:39:29,210 --> 01:39:29,910
All right.

2264
01:39:30,450 --> 01:39:31,130
Well, now I know.

2265
01:39:33,790 --> 01:39:34,350
Okay.

2266
01:39:36,010 --> 01:39:37,290
Okay, now I know.

2267
01:39:37,690 --> 01:39:41,470
Now I know when he does that jump, like, I gotta go.

2268
01:39:41,890 --> 01:39:43,350
I gotta leave.

2269
01:39:43,930 --> 01:39:44,370
Okay.

2270
01:39:44,770 --> 01:39:51,950
Okay, this is really bad because I haven't found any... I think, like, the checkpoints at the moment do not seem very obvious.

2271
01:39:52,230 --> 01:39:53,070
Oh my god, that's a gun.

2272
01:39:53,250 --> 01:39:53,730
That's a gun.

2273
01:39:53,790 --> 01:39:54,370
I can't fight that.

2274
01:39:54,470 --> 01:39:54,910
I have no HP.

2275
01:39:55,110 --> 01:39:55,810
I actually have no HP.

2276
01:39:57,650 --> 01:40:01,130
The matchlock musket were well established by the side.

2277
01:40:01,790 --> 01:40:03,170
Belarious, thank you for the super chat.

2278
01:40:03,430 --> 01:40:03,710
Thank you.

2279
01:40:03,830 --> 01:40:04,130
Thank you.

2280
01:40:04,270 --> 01:40:07,830
Okay, but why do the demons have guns, though?

2281
01:40:08,170 --> 01:40:10,530
Like, that's my issue.

2282
01:40:10,530 --> 01:40:13,730
Why do the demons have guns?

2283
01:40:15,150 --> 01:40:16,770
I guess I'll use this for now.

2284
01:40:17,070 --> 01:40:18,650
Because I... I need HP.

2285
01:40:21,930 --> 01:40:23,570
Gun is gun.

2286
01:40:23,810 --> 01:40:27,710
And the demons gotta defend themselves, though, Kee.

2287
01:40:31,410 --> 01:40:34,390
Like... Like... There's no way of time for this!

2288
01:40:36,270 --> 01:40:37,690
Oh my god!

2289
01:40:43,500 --> 01:40:45,260
Because they're demons!

2290
01:40:46,660 --> 01:40:47,700
Because they're demons!

2291
01:40:49,920 --> 01:40:50,440
Okay...

2292
01:40:50,440 --> 01:40:53,320
Well, now I know that if they shoot that, it explodes.

2293
01:40:53,640 --> 01:40:55,300
That's, like, the dynamite in this world.

2294
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,100
There's a lot of things, places to go.

2295
01:40:59,380 --> 01:41:02,440
I'm, like, trying to make sure that I don't miss much.

2296
01:41:05,060 --> 01:41:08,540
I am worried that I don't know where the checkpoint is.

2297
01:41:08,540 --> 01:41:11,140
I'm gonna go left side, because the other guy was there.

2298
01:41:16,400 --> 01:41:18,260
I have no... I don't know which one I like.

2299
01:41:18,340 --> 01:41:20,160
I like the halberd and the spear.

2300
01:41:20,380 --> 01:41:23,940
I don't like... I definitely don't like the sword, though.

2301
01:41:24,220 --> 01:41:25,540
I'm not a fan of the sword.

2302
01:41:25,720 --> 01:41:30,580
The damage... I know it's, like, faster, but the damage is way too low for my liking.

2303
01:41:31,380 --> 01:41:32,640
I'll go here first.

2304
01:41:34,700 --> 01:41:35,660
Okay, so...

2305
01:41:36,220 --> 01:41:38,700
Special items in pick-up during your journey can be equipped on your item bar.

2306
01:41:38,820 --> 01:41:40,800
To do this, navigate to equipment and...

2307
01:41:41,560 --> 01:41:47,600
On specific... when used with certain objects may trigger a chain reaction that eases combat battles.

2308
01:41:47,600 --> 01:41:51,980
Okay, so I might have a...

2309
01:41:51,980 --> 01:41:51,980
bomb?

2310
01:41:59,280 --> 01:42:00,200
Okay.

2311
01:42:00,920 --> 01:42:03,760
So, I can equip... this.

2312
01:42:06,960 --> 01:42:09,700
And then... oh...

2313
01:42:10,100 --> 01:42:11,460
Okay, and then...

2314
01:42:16,830 --> 01:42:17,750
Uh...

2315
01:42:18,310 --> 01:42:19,830
Where's my... how do I swap?

2316
01:42:20,070 --> 01:42:20,470
Oh, here.

2317
01:42:22,510 --> 01:42:23,390
And then...

2318
01:42:29,150 --> 01:42:30,090
I did it.

2319
01:42:31,310 --> 01:42:32,050
Oh, cool!

2320
01:42:32,290 --> 01:42:32,510
Okay.

2321
01:42:32,950 --> 01:42:33,850
That's how you do it.

2322
01:42:35,450 --> 01:42:36,690
Alright, I did it.

2323
01:42:36,910 --> 01:42:37,730
I mean, it killed like...

2324
01:42:37,730 --> 01:42:39,510
Okay, it killed more than one guy.

2325
01:42:41,370 --> 01:42:41,810
Whoops.

2326
01:42:43,490 --> 01:42:44,050
Look, sir.

2327
01:42:45,030 --> 01:42:47,130
I don't wanna be a bad person.

2328
01:42:47,130 --> 01:42:49,210
Ha ha ha.

2329
01:42:49,410 --> 01:42:49,430
Ha ha ha.

2330
01:42:51,650 --> 01:42:52,850
Oh, shit.

2331
01:42:57,190 --> 01:42:58,270
I don't know.

2332
01:42:58,430 --> 01:42:59,290
I just didn't dodge...

2333
01:42:59,850 --> 01:43:00,030
For it.

2334
01:43:00,250 --> 01:43:00,690
I know!

2335
01:43:04,910 --> 01:43:05,630
Okay.

2336
01:43:05,970 --> 01:43:06,350
I...

2337
01:43:06,350 --> 01:43:10,870
He was a bad person.

2338
01:43:11,390 --> 01:43:11,930
Okay...

2339
01:43:11,930 --> 01:43:12,850
Oh, my God.

2340
01:43:13,130 --> 01:43:13,410
Okay.

2341
01:43:14,830 --> 01:43:21,210
Okay, we gotta go all the way... Oh my god, there's so... I must have missed a checkpoint somewhere.

2342
01:43:21,450 --> 01:43:23,590
Cause there's no way, there's no checkpoint at all.

2343
01:43:25,990 --> 01:43:30,810
He literally blew up three of his... Okay, three of his friends were fucking demons!

2344
01:43:31,070 --> 01:43:34,370
Like, at that point, maybe I'm not the bad person.

2345
01:43:37,050 --> 01:43:40,530
I did not expect him to be, like, that strong, not gonna lie.

2346
01:43:41,290 --> 01:43:41,850
But...

2347
01:43:44,750 --> 01:43:48,450
So, like, magic is, like, super rare.

2348
01:43:48,450 --> 01:43:50,630
Cause it's coming from these flowers.

2349
01:43:51,070 --> 01:43:52,450
Oh, I keep my weapon, though.

2350
01:43:52,550 --> 01:43:52,790
Okay.

2351
01:44:02,220 --> 01:44:02,760
Okay.

2352
01:44:04,240 --> 01:44:04,860
Parry this.

2353
01:44:04,940 --> 01:44:07,260
You can't parry with a spear, so...

2354
01:44:07,260 --> 01:44:08,800
You can parry with... this.

2355
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,200
Um, it is, like, with...

2356
01:44:14,300 --> 01:44:16,300
It's with the L... LT?

2357
01:44:16,660 --> 01:44:16,920
Yeah.

2358
01:44:17,260 --> 01:44:19,120
You can parry with this, but...

2359
01:44:20,500 --> 01:44:21,640
Not with a spear.

2360
01:44:29,900 --> 01:44:31,660
My god, that hit you!

2361
01:44:32,820 --> 01:44:34,140
Oh my god, I hate these...

2362
01:44:34,140 --> 01:44:35,460
I hate these guys so much.

2363
01:44:35,620 --> 01:44:36,400
I actually hate them.

2364
01:44:36,680 --> 01:44:38,540
I hate them so much.

2365
01:44:39,460 --> 01:44:39,900
I...

2366
01:44:44,740 --> 01:44:46,360
Can I get magic back?

2367
01:44:46,480 --> 01:44:48,140
Oh, I can get magic back for dodging?

2368
01:44:48,260 --> 01:44:48,460
Okay.

2369
01:44:49,320 --> 01:44:50,960
I hate the... the jockeys.

2370
01:44:52,620 --> 01:44:53,740
Okay, I can do this again.

2371
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:54,780
That's good that I died.

2372
01:45:00,280 --> 01:45:01,900
Okay, that's off, right?

2373
01:45:02,860 --> 01:45:04,000
That's off, right?

2374
01:45:06,440 --> 01:45:08,500
Okay, we gotta kill...

2375
01:45:12,180 --> 01:45:14,920
Why do they do so much damage?

2376
01:45:16,220 --> 01:45:18,520
Bro, like, all you do is pray!

2377
01:45:23,360 --> 01:45:23,660
Okay.

2378
01:45:24,980 --> 01:45:26,440
Okay, these guys...

2379
01:45:26,440 --> 01:45:27,220
I have to...

2380
01:45:27,220 --> 01:45:27,660
I'm sorry.

2381
01:45:28,040 --> 01:45:28,320
I...

2382
01:45:28,840 --> 01:45:29,620
No witnesses.

2383
01:45:33,960 --> 01:45:35,160
Alright, next.

2384
01:45:39,460 --> 01:45:40,100
Bye.

2385
01:45:43,920 --> 01:45:44,560
Alright.

2386
01:45:44,900 --> 01:45:47,220
I don't know if I have invincibility frames.

2387
01:45:51,860 --> 01:45:54,100
He prayed for TPS.

2388
01:45:54,100 --> 01:45:54,380
He prayed for TPS.

2389
01:45:55,280 --> 01:45:56,700
Alright, I'm just gonna...

2390
01:45:56,700 --> 01:45:58,160
Skip this area.

2391
01:45:59,840 --> 01:46:01,140
It was like...

2392
01:46:01,140 --> 01:46:02,700
Here, and then we go this way.

2393
01:46:03,520 --> 01:46:04,860
Oh my god, it's Gunman.

2394
01:46:05,500 --> 01:46:06,960
Okay, we're Soling now.

2395
01:46:07,660 --> 01:46:08,820
Where I skipped this area.

2396
01:46:09,040 --> 01:46:09,500
This is...

2397
01:46:09,500 --> 01:46:10,600
There's too much stuff here.

2398
01:46:15,460 --> 01:46:18,160
Okay, where's that fucker that was hiding?

2399
01:46:20,420 --> 01:46:21,020
Okay.

2400
01:46:21,020 --> 01:46:21,480
Where is he?

2401
01:46:23,980 --> 01:46:24,740
Wait, what?

2402
01:46:24,840 --> 01:46:25,420
Okay, there you are.

2403
01:46:27,320 --> 01:46:28,660
Now, where's your friend?

2404
01:46:29,220 --> 01:46:30,360
That's fucking right!

2405
01:46:30,420 --> 01:46:31,600
I knew you were alive!

2406
01:46:32,120 --> 01:46:33,160
Get out of here!

2407
01:46:38,200 --> 01:46:40,080
I hit first, idiot!

2408
01:46:40,680 --> 01:46:41,660
That's right!

2409
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:42,240
Okay.

2410
01:46:43,120 --> 01:46:43,720
Okay.

2411
01:46:44,120 --> 01:46:45,160
Halbert is actually...

2412
01:46:45,160 --> 01:46:46,000
It's so much better.

2413
01:46:48,580 --> 01:46:50,700
It is actually so much better.

2414
01:46:52,560 --> 01:46:54,100
Okay, now we do this again.

2415
01:46:55,580 --> 01:46:56,340
Wait, what?

2416
01:46:56,760 --> 01:46:57,700
What the?!

2417
01:47:10,850 --> 01:47:12,950
Oh my god, I can't even read it.

2418
01:47:13,170 --> 01:47:13,510
I...

2419
01:47:13,510 --> 01:47:14,690
I can't even read it.

2420
01:47:14,750 --> 01:47:14,970
I...

2421
01:47:14,970 --> 01:47:15,670
I'm so confused.

2422
01:47:15,670 --> 01:47:16,210
What was that?

2423
01:47:19,890 --> 01:47:20,370
What...

2424
01:47:20,370 --> 01:47:21,730
What was that?

2425
01:47:21,930 --> 01:47:22,370
Like, I...

2426
01:47:22,370 --> 01:47:24,530
I couldn't even process what that was.

2427
01:47:25,230 --> 01:47:26,250
Okay, here we go.

2428
01:47:32,190 --> 01:47:36,710
Killing non-feathered humanoids or dying in combat will increase your madness.

2429
01:47:36,930 --> 01:47:41,970
However, deviating most feathered enemies and killed targets will reduce your madness.

2430
01:47:42,170 --> 01:47:43,190
You will only lose...

2431
01:47:43,190 --> 01:47:44,330
Excuse me?

2432
01:47:44,510 --> 01:47:45,750
Like, am I...

2433
01:47:48,520 --> 01:47:50,670
Am I writing a thesis right now?

2434
01:47:50,670 --> 01:47:52,570
You will only lose...

2435
01:47:52,570 --> 01:47:53,170
Um...

2436
01:47:53,710 --> 01:47:54,270
Some...

2437
01:47:54,270 --> 01:47:55,370
Red...

2438
01:47:55,370 --> 01:47:56,450
Mercury...

2439
01:47:56,450 --> 01:47:57,210
If you perish...

2440
01:47:57,210 --> 01:47:59,970
Perish while less than 50% madness.

2441
01:48:00,270 --> 01:48:01,170
You will lose...

2442
01:48:01,730 --> 01:48:06,610
Plenty of red mercury if you perish while at above 50% but below.

2443
01:48:06,930 --> 01:48:09,390
How crazy am I?!

2444
01:48:09,390 --> 01:48:10,650
You will lose...

2445
01:48:10,650 --> 01:48:10,930
Okay.

2446
01:48:12,470 --> 01:48:15,290
There's a morality system?!

2447
01:48:15,290 --> 01:48:18,430
What philosophy class am I in?!

2448
01:48:18,430 --> 01:48:19,930
Turn red while at above...

2449
01:48:19,930 --> 01:48:20,650
Oh my god, that's...

2450
01:48:20,650 --> 01:48:21,910
That's why my eyes were red.

2451
01:48:22,110 --> 01:48:22,330
That's why my eyes were red.

2452
01:48:22,330 --> 01:48:24,090
But they were trying to kill me!

2453
01:48:25,190 --> 01:48:25,990
Like, I...

2454
01:48:27,550 --> 01:48:29,850
Those humans were trying to kill me!

2455
01:48:33,550 --> 01:48:34,030
Like...

2456
01:48:34,890 --> 01:48:37,350
Huchir has turned red.

2457
01:48:38,150 --> 01:48:42,610
Activating related nodes in the MPs repository grants enhanced effects.

2458
01:48:43,050 --> 01:48:45,350
The modding marks begin appearing while at above.

2459
01:48:45,490 --> 01:48:47,550
This makes you deal and take increase...

2460
01:48:47,550 --> 01:48:48,590
Oh my god!

2461
01:48:48,850 --> 01:48:49,850
That makes...

2462
01:48:49,850 --> 01:48:52,430
So much more sense now!

2463
01:48:52,830 --> 01:48:52,910
So much more sense now!

2464
01:48:52,910 --> 01:48:53,190
And I...

2465
01:48:53,190 --> 01:48:54,510
I was like, what the fuck?

2466
01:48:54,650 --> 01:48:56,770
Why are these bugs doing so much damage?

2467
01:49:01,360 --> 01:49:02,160
Why are these bugs doing so much damage?

2468
01:49:02,160 --> 01:49:04,240
Pray by offering divine gifts?

2469
01:49:04,640 --> 01:49:07,900
I have to give him gifts too?!

2470
01:49:07,900 --> 01:49:08,600
I...

2471
01:49:11,400 --> 01:49:13,240
Oh my god!

2472
01:49:13,620 --> 01:49:15,800
I think I have to give my divine god...

2473
01:49:15,800 --> 01:49:16,620
The...

2474
01:49:16,620 --> 01:49:17,180
The...

2475
01:49:17,180 --> 01:49:17,540
The...

2476
01:49:17,540 --> 01:49:17,940
A super chat?

2477
01:49:25,520 --> 01:49:28,260
Shall you perish while at full madness?

2478
01:49:28,520 --> 01:49:31,560
A powerful demon that chases you will madness it...

2479
01:49:32,560 --> 01:49:35,280
My inner demon will...

2480
01:49:35,280 --> 01:49:36,300
Okay...

2481
01:49:37,460 --> 01:49:37,880
Okay...

2482
01:49:39,200 --> 01:49:40,140
So I...

2483
01:49:40,140 --> 01:49:40,620
I...

2484
01:49:40,620 --> 01:49:41,140
Basically...

2485
01:49:41,140 --> 01:49:42,060
I lost...

2486
01:49:42,060 --> 01:49:42,660
Okay...

2487
01:49:42,660 --> 01:49:45,100
So I lost all the red mercury from that.

2488
01:49:49,400 --> 01:49:49,960
Okay...

2489
01:49:49,960 --> 01:49:52,120
That actually makes so much more sense.

2490
01:49:52,280 --> 01:49:53,680
I was like, wondering why...

2491
01:49:53,680 --> 01:49:56,520
This monk did so much damage to me.

2492
01:49:56,640 --> 01:49:57,940
And I was like, bro, what the fuck?

2493
01:49:58,480 --> 01:50:00,280
I literally saw you praying.

2494
01:50:01,080 --> 01:50:01,640
Like...

2495
01:50:01,640 --> 01:50:02,420
Like how...

2496
01:50:02,420 --> 01:50:03,220
Like, look at him!

2497
01:50:05,180 --> 01:50:05,740
Like...

2498
01:50:05,740 --> 01:50:06,740
Look at this guy!

2499
01:50:06,740 --> 01:50:07,120
That...

2500
01:50:09,880 --> 01:50:10,500
You're...

2501
01:50:10,500 --> 01:50:11,300
Crazy dick!

2502
01:50:11,480 --> 01:50:13,080
You think we tried Goon's area?

2503
01:50:16,950 --> 01:50:19,600
Okay, this is definitely a lot more complicated...

2504
01:50:19,600 --> 01:50:21,280
Than I thought it was gonna...

2505
01:50:21,280 --> 01:50:22,240
Than I thought...

2506
01:50:24,340 --> 01:50:25,740
Oh, I have another sword!

2507
01:50:30,260 --> 01:50:30,570
It's...

2508
01:50:30,570 --> 01:50:31,650
A lot...

2509
01:50:31,650 --> 01:50:32,560
Down, so...

2510
01:50:36,240 --> 01:50:38,250
Okay, we'll try this sword then.

2511
01:50:39,070 --> 01:50:41,530
It's definitely a lot more complicated than I thought.

2512
01:50:45,930 --> 01:50:47,390
Which isn't a bad thing.

2513
01:50:47,750 --> 01:50:49,550
But it definitely is like, you know...

2514
01:50:50,390 --> 01:50:50,910
Jesus...

2515
01:50:50,910 --> 01:50:51,450
No!

2516
01:50:51,630 --> 01:50:51,790
No!

2517
01:50:51,970 --> 01:50:52,810
I just...

2518
01:50:52,810 --> 01:50:53,250
God!

2519
01:50:56,970 --> 01:50:57,770
Oh my god!

2520
01:50:58,210 --> 01:51:00,750
I hate these jumping guys!

2521
01:51:02,470 --> 01:51:03,730
I was gonna say...

2522
01:51:03,730 --> 01:51:03,890
It was...

2523
01:51:03,890 --> 01:51:05,110
It's a lot more complicated.

2524
01:51:05,110 --> 01:51:06,650
Which sets it apart from other souls.

2525
01:51:06,650 --> 01:51:07,090
Like...

2526
01:51:07,090 --> 01:51:07,550
Like...

2527
01:51:07,550 --> 01:51:08,490
It has it's own thing.

2528
01:51:08,930 --> 01:51:09,730
Or a guy in the souls.

2529
01:51:10,590 --> 01:51:11,190
Like...

2530
01:51:12,010 --> 01:51:12,610
Um...

2531
01:51:12,610 --> 01:51:13,130
Genre.

2532
01:51:15,350 --> 01:51:17,190
For now, I'm like...

2533
01:51:17,190 --> 01:51:18,570
I'm like wondering where...

2534
01:51:18,570 --> 01:51:20,250
Where is the checkpoint though?

2535
01:51:23,050 --> 01:51:24,610
At least I can keep the knife.

2536
01:51:28,010 --> 01:51:30,790
I don't really understand the...

2537
01:51:30,790 --> 01:51:32,430
Madness system that much.

2538
01:51:32,770 --> 01:51:33,470
To be fair.

2539
01:51:39,350 --> 01:51:40,030
Okay.

2540
01:51:42,270 --> 01:51:44,190
The madness system is...

2541
01:51:44,190 --> 01:51:45,830
It's a little confusing for me.

2542
01:51:50,740 --> 01:51:52,200
You kill non...

2543
01:51:52,200 --> 01:51:52,360
Yeah!

2544
01:51:52,520 --> 01:51:52,920
But they...

2545
01:51:52,920 --> 01:51:54,060
They did it first!

2546
01:51:54,180 --> 01:51:55,540
It's not even my fault!

2547
01:51:56,340 --> 01:51:57,760
They started it!

2548
01:52:00,300 --> 01:52:01,560
Okay, I can finally do this.

2549
01:52:12,770 --> 01:52:13,330
Okay.

2550
01:52:13,930 --> 01:52:14,490
Okay.

2551
01:52:26,330 --> 01:52:26,890
Alright.

2552
01:52:27,510 --> 01:52:29,170
Okay, these guys are feathered though.

2553
01:52:29,430 --> 01:52:29,890
So like...

2554
01:52:29,890 --> 01:52:31,150
It's good that I killed them.

2555
01:52:32,970 --> 01:52:34,330
I get less mad.

2556
01:52:34,630 --> 01:52:34,950
Yeah.

2557
01:52:38,830 --> 01:52:39,170
No!

2558
01:52:39,450 --> 01:52:39,710
Like...

2559
01:52:39,710 --> 01:52:40,890
If they're feathered...

2560
01:52:40,890 --> 01:52:42,830
I get less madness though.

2561
01:52:42,990 --> 01:52:43,770
That's what they said.

2562
01:52:44,450 --> 01:52:46,410
So I had to kill them.

2563
01:52:52,380 --> 01:52:54,400
They had madness guys!

2564
01:52:55,600 --> 01:52:55,940
I'm...

2565
01:52:55,940 --> 01:52:57,440
I'm helping the world!

2566
01:53:02,770 --> 01:53:03,450
Yeah.

2567
01:53:03,630 --> 01:53:05,890
Feathered enemies equals less madness.

2568
01:53:07,210 --> 01:53:08,030
So like...

2569
01:53:08,030 --> 01:53:09,850
Even though they were defenseless...

2570
01:53:09,850 --> 01:53:10,110
Like...

2571
01:53:10,110 --> 01:53:11,730
I was doing the right thing.

2572
01:53:13,690 --> 01:53:14,310
Okay.

2573
01:53:14,450 --> 01:53:15,850
I feel like this is better though.

2574
01:53:16,030 --> 01:53:16,550
Against this guy.

2575
01:53:17,770 --> 01:53:18,730
Time first!

2576
01:53:19,270 --> 01:53:20,010
That's right!

2577
01:53:21,050 --> 01:53:22,290
And then...

2578
01:53:23,070 --> 01:53:25,070
Like the weapon swaps are like...

2579
01:53:25,070 --> 01:53:25,530
Nice though.

2580
01:53:28,430 --> 01:53:29,510
I'm feathered...

2581
01:53:29,510 --> 01:53:30,790
Yeah, and I hate my own kind.

2582
01:53:31,610 --> 01:53:32,230
Like...

2583
01:53:32,230 --> 01:53:32,890
Oh shit.

2584
01:53:33,550 --> 01:53:34,410
Oh shit.

2585
01:53:38,190 --> 01:53:39,310
Okay, that didn't work.

2586
01:53:45,550 --> 01:53:47,290
Yeah, the swap is like smooth though.

2587
01:53:47,370 --> 01:53:47,770
I like that.

2588
01:53:49,070 --> 01:53:49,710
Oh my god!

2589
01:53:49,890 --> 01:53:50,230
Oh my god!

2590
01:53:50,390 --> 01:53:50,930
Oh my god!

2591
01:53:51,110 --> 01:53:51,690
Oh my god!

2592
01:53:51,690 --> 01:53:52,370
Oh my...

2593
01:53:56,620 --> 01:53:56,940
Whoa!

2594
01:53:57,540 --> 01:53:58,020
Whoa!

2595
01:54:00,660 --> 01:54:01,620
They're so fast!

2596
01:54:01,840 --> 01:54:02,960
They're so fast!

2597
01:54:05,180 --> 01:54:05,780
Okay.

2598
01:54:08,760 --> 01:54:10,220
Okay, that was awkward.

2599
01:54:10,580 --> 01:54:11,300
I live.

2600
01:54:11,500 --> 01:54:12,860
I-I don't know how I did that.

2601
01:54:15,540 --> 01:54:16,140
Okay.

2602
01:54:16,140 --> 01:54:19,120
Now, now, now I'm definitely having madness now, though.

2603
01:54:19,300 --> 01:54:23,200
I will admit, this might lead, might lead to madness.

2604
01:54:27,960 --> 01:54:33,020
I realize, like, I don't lose a lot, too, of, uh...

2605
01:54:37,160 --> 01:54:39,280
Okay, they, they started it!

2606
01:54:39,360 --> 01:54:41,540
We all saw that they started it, guys.

2607
01:54:41,880 --> 01:54:43,860
What do you mean, have mercy?

2608
01:54:46,420 --> 01:54:47,080
Okay, see?

2609
01:54:47,260 --> 01:54:48,720
Look, my eyes aren't red yet.

2610
01:54:48,880 --> 01:54:49,380
It's fine.

2611
01:54:53,720 --> 01:54:55,120
They literally started!

2612
01:54:59,850 --> 01:55:01,450
I'm still gonna try and grab that item.

2613
01:55:06,270 --> 01:55:07,350
I love it.

2614
01:55:09,990 --> 01:55:11,470
I'll grab this item, too, yoink.

2615
01:55:14,070 --> 01:55:17,850
I feel like I don't lose that much runes, do I?

2616
01:55:17,910 --> 01:55:18,510
Yeah, I don't.

2617
01:55:19,310 --> 01:55:21,050
I actually don't lose that much.

2618
01:55:26,260 --> 01:55:26,900
Okay.

2619
01:55:28,980 --> 01:55:29,820
All right.

2620
01:55:31,040 --> 01:55:32,800
What the fuck?!

2621
01:55:33,640 --> 01:55:34,280
What?!

2622
01:55:39,230 --> 01:55:40,970
Okay, I hate these guys.

2623
01:55:41,290 --> 01:55:42,870
Those little jumping things they do.

2624
01:55:46,030 --> 01:55:49,830
There's a gauge at the corner for how mad...

2625
01:55:49,830 --> 01:55:50,570
I can't...

2626
01:55:50,570 --> 01:55:50,730
Where?

2627
01:55:51,790 --> 01:55:52,170
Where?

2628
01:55:52,310 --> 01:55:52,970
Which corridor?

2629
01:55:53,350 --> 01:55:54,790
I can't tell right now.

2630
01:55:54,890 --> 01:55:55,770
Oh my god, thank god.

2631
01:55:55,890 --> 01:55:57,510
The shrine was there this entire time.

2632
01:55:58,050 --> 01:55:58,570
Okay, let me...

2633
01:56:02,650 --> 01:56:03,430
Let me...

2634
01:56:03,430 --> 01:56:03,910
Give me a sec.

2635
01:56:03,990 --> 01:56:06,730
Let me perform my blood offering before I help you.

2636
01:56:10,070 --> 01:56:10,670
Okay.

2637
01:56:11,890 --> 01:56:12,590
What do you want?

2638
01:56:13,970 --> 01:56:16,170
Oh, now you don't want to talk?!

2639
01:56:17,630 --> 01:56:18,230
Okay.

2640
01:56:19,350 --> 01:56:19,730
Wait.

2641
01:56:20,050 --> 01:56:21,010
Can I kill this?

2642
01:56:25,430 --> 01:56:26,030
What?

2643
01:56:31,970 --> 01:56:34,310
Oh my god, you're so lucky I can't jump.

2644
01:56:36,030 --> 01:56:38,250
You're so lucky I can't jump.

2645
01:56:41,490 --> 01:56:42,790
Oh shit, hello.

2646
01:56:47,380 --> 01:56:49,460
You have a name, so you must be important.

2647
01:56:51,800 --> 01:56:53,000
Wait, that's it?

2648
01:56:53,340 --> 01:56:55,260
You fallen and couldn't get up?

2649
01:56:57,580 --> 01:57:02,640
I just stepped out for a breather and ran into a fine woman.

2650
01:57:04,620 --> 01:57:05,980
Wait, was this a trap?

2651
01:57:06,500 --> 01:57:07,240
Who are you?

2652
01:57:08,180 --> 01:57:09,320
Name's Wu-Gang.

2653
01:57:09,940 --> 01:57:11,580
I'm Du-Tanga's right hand.

2654
01:57:12,260 --> 01:57:14,140
I take care of the big jobs.

2655
01:57:15,780 --> 01:57:19,220
Those temple fools keep sniffing around for my treasure.

2656
01:57:19,900 --> 01:57:22,200
Soon as I send word to the boss...

2657
01:57:22,200 --> 01:57:23,080
Wait, I'm like Gollum?

2658
01:57:26,280 --> 01:57:27,080
That's it?

2659
01:57:28,320 --> 01:57:29,940
There's temple fools too.

2660
01:57:30,420 --> 01:57:33,220
Okay, he doesn't seem like that bad of a guy.

2661
01:57:35,220 --> 01:57:37,540
All right, time to...

2662
01:57:37,540 --> 01:57:38,720
While I was trying to get invoked to pray.

2663
01:57:38,880 --> 01:57:41,820
Pray will grant you rare items at a cost of increased items.

2664
01:57:42,520 --> 01:57:49,120
Okay, how about before I pray, let me upgrade the stuff I can.

2665
01:57:51,460 --> 01:57:52,020
Well...

2666
01:57:52,020 --> 01:57:52,980
Wait, I don't?

2667
01:57:54,560 --> 01:57:56,420
Oh, lost remains.

2668
01:57:56,420 --> 01:57:57,840
Oh, there you go.

2669
01:57:58,120 --> 01:57:59,140
Forgotten Remembrance.

2670
01:58:01,300 --> 01:58:02,760
Okay, so now I have three.

2671
01:58:03,060 --> 01:58:06,100
Okay, oh, that's what Forgotten Remembrance is.

2672
01:58:06,680 --> 01:58:08,040
So each of them...

2673
01:58:08,040 --> 01:58:09,680
Okay, I get it now.

2674
01:58:10,160 --> 01:58:11,100
Oh, that is...

2675
01:58:11,100 --> 01:58:12,520
Oh, that is complicated.

2676
01:58:16,020 --> 01:58:17,300
Okay, I feel that...

2677
01:58:21,740 --> 01:58:23,100
Wait, did I not do this?

2678
01:58:23,200 --> 01:58:23,880
Did I not save?

2679
01:58:31,600 --> 01:58:32,480
Flickering Blade.

2680
01:58:35,100 --> 01:58:36,540
I currently...

2681
01:58:36,540 --> 01:58:37,120
I currently...

2682
01:58:37,120 --> 01:58:38,000
Oh my god.

2683
01:58:39,080 --> 01:58:40,180
What the...

2684
01:58:40,180 --> 01:58:43,500
It's moving so fast, I can't even see what it does.

2685
01:58:45,620 --> 01:58:47,980
Okay, I can launch a counter.

2686
01:58:52,560 --> 01:58:56,200
Heavy dash and the final strike stacks you have activated.

2687
01:58:56,200 --> 01:59:01,520
Use sacks can be inverted to set a ratio by landing spear light attacks.

2688
01:59:02,160 --> 01:59:03,900
Okay, I'm just...

2689
01:59:03,900 --> 01:59:04,540
Ungabunga.

2690
01:59:07,320 --> 01:59:08,080
Sorry.

2691
01:59:08,080 --> 01:59:09,460
I saw...

2692
01:59:09,460 --> 01:59:10,580
I saw...

2693
01:59:10,580 --> 01:59:11,140
Ungabunga.

2694
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:12,440
Ungabunga.

2695
01:59:12,440 --> 01:59:13,040
That I...

2696
01:59:13,040 --> 01:59:13,880
I'll just...

2697
01:59:13,880 --> 01:59:14,640
Ungabunga.

2698
01:59:15,220 --> 01:59:18,260
It seems a lot easier for me.

2699
01:59:24,260 --> 01:59:28,080
I feel like that's the way.

2700
01:59:32,480 --> 01:59:34,660
What is Ungabunga?

2701
01:59:34,760 --> 01:59:36,260
I use axe.

2702
01:59:37,080 --> 01:59:39,280
That is Ungabunga.

2703
01:59:42,480 --> 01:59:43,100
All right.

2704
01:59:43,260 --> 01:59:44,520
Time to be...

2705
01:59:45,460 --> 01:59:45,940
Oh.

2706
01:59:47,120 --> 01:59:47,900
Can I...

2707
01:59:47,900 --> 01:59:49,300
Benedict this still?

2708
01:59:49,540 --> 01:59:50,160
Oh no.

2709
01:59:50,360 --> 01:59:50,580
Okay.

2710
01:59:54,410 --> 01:59:54,890
Okay.

2711
01:59:55,070 --> 01:59:57,170
It's time to be mad, I guess.

2712
01:59:57,330 --> 01:59:57,690
Oh wait.

2713
01:59:57,930 --> 01:59:58,830
I don't need to.

2714
02:00:00,370 --> 02:00:02,210
I don't need any of these though, right?

2715
02:00:02,210 --> 02:00:05,990
Raise one spirit and most likely tamed, given the...

2716
02:00:05,990 --> 02:00:07,110
And ward off evil.

2717
02:00:07,310 --> 02:00:08,090
Boost all status.

2718
02:00:08,270 --> 02:00:10,050
Respect resistance for certain...

2719
02:00:10,050 --> 02:00:11,270
Generally boost recovery.

2720
02:00:12,090 --> 02:00:13,790
And here it does increase your madness.

2721
02:00:13,950 --> 02:00:16,110
Grind five stacks of skyborne might.

2722
02:00:16,850 --> 02:00:17,410
Okay.

2723
02:00:17,510 --> 02:00:18,990
So this should be fine.

2724
02:00:20,510 --> 02:00:21,070
Let's...

2725
02:00:21,070 --> 02:00:22,110
What's my thing?

2726
02:00:22,230 --> 02:00:22,370
Okay.

2727
02:00:22,470 --> 02:00:23,630
We got enter a dream.

2728
02:00:25,330 --> 02:00:26,010
All right.

2729
02:00:26,270 --> 02:00:26,830
Ungabunga.

2730
02:00:36,440 --> 02:00:37,180
All right.

2731
02:00:38,940 --> 02:00:40,900
Things should be okay now.

2732
02:00:41,280 --> 02:00:43,400
I don't know what to do with this bird though.

2733
02:00:45,060 --> 02:00:46,500
He's just chilling there.

2734
02:01:01,480 --> 02:01:02,040
Wait.

2735
02:01:02,300 --> 02:01:03,120
Why am I...

2736
02:01:04,260 --> 02:01:06,020
Why am I the bad person?

2737
02:01:06,180 --> 02:01:07,740
They literally murdered this village.

2738
02:01:07,740 --> 02:01:10,480
But oh, I have to fight my inner demons?

2739
02:01:11,020 --> 02:01:11,800
Like...

2740
02:01:13,760 --> 02:01:15,780
They literally killed children!

2741
02:01:16,120 --> 02:01:18,100
But oh no, that's...

2742
02:01:18,100 --> 02:01:20,800
Me killing because they're human.

2743
02:01:20,800 --> 02:01:22,500
I'm the bad person.

2744
02:01:25,940 --> 02:01:28,180
This guy literally was dragging behind.

2745
02:01:28,480 --> 02:01:29,200
He killed children!

2746
02:01:31,080 --> 02:01:31,860
Okay.

2747
02:01:32,860 --> 02:01:34,800
Because I'm feathered.

2748
02:01:35,680 --> 02:01:37,260
That's too far.

2749
02:01:37,740 --> 02:01:38,980
There's no tree, pheasant, quill.

2750
02:01:39,080 --> 02:01:40,940
I refuse to hunt his tail.

2751
02:01:41,400 --> 02:01:42,940
There's no tree, pheasant, quill.

2752
02:01:43,940 --> 02:01:45,540
Poke, poke, poke, poke, poke.

2753
02:01:48,160 --> 02:01:49,240
Okay, he's fast.

2754
02:01:49,540 --> 02:01:50,500
What the fuck?

2755
02:01:50,520 --> 02:01:51,180
He's so fast.

2756
02:01:51,800 --> 02:01:52,460
It's okay.

2757
02:01:52,620 --> 02:01:53,240
Oh my...

2758
02:01:53,240 --> 02:01:53,640
What?

2759
02:01:56,740 --> 02:01:57,560
He's not...

2760
02:01:57,560 --> 02:02:00,360
He's not even doing anything and I get hit.

2761
02:02:01,300 --> 02:02:02,840
Okay, I understand now.

2762
02:02:08,140 --> 02:02:10,720
Yeah, the hitbox is crazy there.

2763
02:02:11,760 --> 02:02:11,940
Alright.

2764
02:02:13,700 --> 02:02:14,960
Let's grab this item.

2765
02:02:18,140 --> 02:02:19,280
Oh, hit the bird.

2766
02:02:19,380 --> 02:02:19,900
I get a feather?

2767
02:02:20,100 --> 02:02:20,800
I can't hit him.

2768
02:02:21,420 --> 02:02:22,220
He's so light.

2769
02:02:22,440 --> 02:02:23,580
Oh, unless maybe...

2770
02:02:25,400 --> 02:02:26,180
Oh my...

2771
02:02:26,180 --> 02:02:27,940
How the fuck do I reach you?

2772
02:02:28,680 --> 02:02:29,140
Like...

2773
02:02:29,140 --> 02:02:30,700
Oh, there we go.

2774
02:02:30,700 --> 02:02:31,620
I reached him.

2775
02:02:32,060 --> 02:02:33,560
Okay, I hit him from there.

2776
02:02:33,560 --> 02:02:35,160
Oh, that's a lot of blood.

2777
02:02:39,580 --> 02:02:40,180
Alright.

2778
02:02:40,480 --> 02:02:40,800
Hello.

2779
02:02:42,340 --> 02:02:42,940
Hello.

2780
02:02:44,360 --> 02:02:45,140
That's right.

2781
02:02:45,220 --> 02:02:46,860
You can't escape from me.

2782
02:02:47,780 --> 02:02:48,920
That's right.

2783
02:02:49,240 --> 02:02:50,340
I'm mad.

2784
02:02:51,560 --> 02:02:52,160
Alright.

2785
02:02:54,100 --> 02:02:55,480
Okay, I need a key.

2786
02:02:57,500 --> 02:02:58,500
Yeah, I need...

2787
02:02:58,500 --> 02:02:59,660
How do I hit that guy?

2788
02:02:59,880 --> 02:03:00,900
Okay, it has to be magic.

2789
02:03:01,240 --> 02:03:01,660
There has...

2790
02:03:01,660 --> 02:03:02,220
There's no way.

2791
02:03:06,870 --> 02:03:08,230
Alright, health pill.

2792
02:03:11,430 --> 02:03:12,610
I got the feather.

2793
02:03:13,310 --> 02:03:14,570
Yeah, I got the feather.

2794
02:03:17,990 --> 02:03:19,970
Okay, just talking about the temple.

2795
02:03:22,050 --> 02:03:22,570
Oh?

2796
02:03:22,790 --> 02:03:23,830
What the fuck?

2797
02:03:24,210 --> 02:03:25,210
Oh my god.

2798
02:03:25,290 --> 02:03:26,390
What the fuck?

2799
02:03:26,390 --> 02:03:26,490
What?

2800
02:03:26,710 --> 02:03:27,770
Oh my god.

2801
02:03:27,790 --> 02:03:29,090
Are you okay, ma'am?

2802
02:03:29,950 --> 02:03:31,170
Oh my god.

2803
02:03:31,310 --> 02:03:31,790
Ma'am, please.

2804
02:03:32,890 --> 02:03:33,930
Please, ma'am.

2805
02:03:33,930 --> 02:03:35,770
Okay, so...

2806
02:03:35,770 --> 02:03:36,150
He does...

2807
02:03:36,150 --> 02:03:37,330
She does poison damage.

2808
02:03:38,810 --> 02:03:40,190
She is not okay.

2809
02:03:41,150 --> 02:03:42,230
Maybe I'll...

2810
02:03:42,230 --> 02:03:43,390
I won't try the fast.

2811
02:03:44,410 --> 02:03:45,390
Oh shit.

2812
02:03:45,570 --> 02:03:46,830
Okay, clearly she just...

2813
02:03:47,290 --> 02:03:48,590
She just fits.

2814
02:03:53,780 --> 02:03:55,220
Oh wait, maybe I could...

2815
02:03:58,340 --> 02:03:59,180
Oh wait.

2816
02:04:00,500 --> 02:04:01,360
Oh my god.

2817
02:04:01,660 --> 02:04:03,240
I do not like...

2818
02:04:03,240 --> 02:04:03,960
Okay, never mind.

2819
02:04:04,740 --> 02:04:05,440
Never mind.

2820
02:04:05,560 --> 02:04:06,440
Back to Ungabunga.

2821
02:04:07,400 --> 02:04:08,500
Never mind.

2822
02:04:08,740 --> 02:04:09,420
I was like...

2823
02:04:09,420 --> 02:04:10,580
What am I doing?

2824
02:04:10,620 --> 02:04:12,680
I'm just dancing around.

2825
02:04:13,380 --> 02:04:13,720
Alright.

2826
02:04:14,940 --> 02:04:17,320
Alright, I should never go...

2827
02:04:17,320 --> 02:04:18,960
Away from Ungabunga.

2828
02:04:19,540 --> 02:04:21,740
I'm literally just dancing around here.

2829
02:04:21,940 --> 02:04:22,220
I...

2830
02:04:22,220 --> 02:04:22,880
I don't know.

2831
02:04:27,780 --> 02:04:29,340
Am I evil yet?

2832
02:04:29,480 --> 02:04:29,680
No.

2833
02:04:30,360 --> 02:04:31,000
I'm not.

2834
02:04:37,830 --> 02:04:38,650
This way.

2835
02:04:40,810 --> 02:04:42,250
Okay, my inner demons.

2836
02:04:42,570 --> 02:04:43,750
It's still okay.

2837
02:04:44,050 --> 02:04:45,330
Okay, this has to be a feather.

2838
02:04:45,330 --> 02:04:48,050
Like, he's literally eating the corpse.

2839
02:04:49,190 --> 02:04:50,210
And like...

2840
02:04:50,210 --> 02:04:51,950
That's a bad thing now.

2841
02:04:52,250 --> 02:04:53,510
Oh my god.

2842
02:04:53,990 --> 02:04:55,370
Bro, your fucking head.

2843
02:04:56,930 --> 02:04:59,030
I'm not doing a bad thing, guys.

2844
02:05:00,830 --> 02:05:02,710
We're supposed to kill them.

2845
02:05:06,720 --> 02:05:07,400
Alright.

2846
02:05:08,920 --> 02:05:10,260
We got Mercury.

2847
02:05:10,800 --> 02:05:11,000
Shoot.

2848
02:05:11,320 --> 02:05:11,680
Mercury.

2849
02:05:12,020 --> 02:05:12,300
Sprout.

2850
02:05:12,680 --> 02:05:13,400
Oh, chest.

2851
02:05:14,060 --> 02:05:15,460
He just wants a hug.

2852
02:05:17,260 --> 02:05:18,100
Okay, I swear.

2853
02:05:18,200 --> 02:05:18,960
I fucking knew it.

2854
02:05:19,040 --> 02:05:19,620
I heard him.

2855
02:05:25,520 --> 02:05:25,960
Okay.

2856
02:05:28,580 --> 02:05:29,020
Ungabunga.

2857
02:05:30,140 --> 02:05:30,580
Ungabunga.

2858
02:05:32,500 --> 02:05:32,940
Ungabunga.

2859
02:05:33,120 --> 02:05:34,820
Did I get lost remains?

2860
02:05:34,960 --> 02:05:35,940
Oh, this is for upgrades.

2861
02:05:40,640 --> 02:05:41,080
Uh...

2862
02:05:41,080 --> 02:05:41,960
Is there anything else here?

2863
02:05:46,530 --> 02:05:47,410
Oh shit!

2864
02:05:47,530 --> 02:05:48,210
There's so many!

2865
02:05:49,610 --> 02:05:50,550
Oh my god.

2866
02:05:51,890 --> 02:05:53,830
So I'm putting them out of their misery, guys.

2867
02:05:55,110 --> 02:05:56,530
I'm doing a good thing.

2868
02:05:58,350 --> 02:05:58,870
Swing!

2869
02:06:00,310 --> 02:06:01,210
Holy shit!

2870
02:06:01,310 --> 02:06:02,270
They do too much damage.

2871
02:06:06,170 --> 02:06:07,590
Give them a hug!

2872
02:06:10,810 --> 02:06:11,330
Alright.

2873
02:06:11,490 --> 02:06:13,190
I'm putting them out of their misery, guys.

2874
02:06:18,460 --> 02:06:21,820
I can't believe Doki would kill the sick and injured like that.

2875
02:06:22,460 --> 02:06:22,740
Look.

2876
02:06:22,740 --> 02:06:24,820
But they were evil, sick and injured.

2877
02:06:26,660 --> 02:06:28,200
So I balance it out.

2878
02:06:28,360 --> 02:06:29,360
They were evil.

2879
02:06:31,580 --> 02:06:37,200
Attack or charging on heavy attacks and striking small and medium-sized from behind can cause them to lose their balance.

2880
02:06:37,460 --> 02:06:39,340
Leaving them vulnerable when this position in front...

2881
02:06:39,340 --> 02:06:39,800
Oh wait, no.

2882
02:06:39,880 --> 02:06:41,300
That's literally the same thing I did.

2883
02:06:44,970 --> 02:06:45,690
What's this?

2884
02:06:46,310 --> 02:06:47,430
No food remains.

2885
02:06:47,630 --> 02:06:49,590
It's time to lock the gate and keep the last of the meat.

2886
02:06:49,970 --> 02:06:50,830
Her tears never cease.

2887
02:06:50,970 --> 02:06:52,950
Is she afraid the people I worship will rise?

2888
02:06:53,390 --> 02:06:53,990
Will comfort her?

2889
02:06:54,270 --> 02:06:54,710
Fear not.

2890
02:06:54,890 --> 02:06:55,830
I keep the key closed.

2891
02:06:56,490 --> 02:06:59,450
Only over my dead body will anyone set foot in the temple.

2892
02:07:00,290 --> 02:07:01,330
Okay, so this...

2893
02:07:01,330 --> 02:07:02,470
Where the fuck...

2894
02:07:07,140 --> 02:07:08,340
Where's his dead body?

2895
02:07:09,360 --> 02:07:09,800
Alright.

2896
02:07:09,840 --> 02:07:11,820
So that has to be a boss fight.

2897
02:07:12,200 --> 02:07:13,160
So I'm gonna...

2898
02:07:13,160 --> 02:07:14,800
I'm gonna level up real fast.

2899
02:07:14,800 --> 02:07:18,100
I realized, like...

2900
02:07:20,820 --> 02:07:21,700
Um...

2901
02:07:21,700 --> 02:07:23,980
For character stats...

2902
02:07:24,520 --> 02:07:26,680
You level up with a skill tree.

2903
02:07:27,600 --> 02:07:30,900
So I find that interesting for a Souls game.

2904
02:07:35,800 --> 02:07:36,680
Okay.

2905
02:07:37,220 --> 02:07:38,400
I find that interesting.

2906
02:07:41,760 --> 02:07:43,080
Okay, uh...

2907
02:07:45,040 --> 02:07:47,180
You gain one stack...

2908
02:07:47,180 --> 02:07:47,860
What this...

2909
02:07:47,860 --> 02:07:49,180
What is this?

2910
02:07:49,860 --> 02:07:52,440
But I don't have burn.

2911
02:07:52,840 --> 02:07:53,540
That's the thing.

2912
02:07:58,150 --> 02:07:59,850
Locking costs the stamina.

2913
02:08:00,490 --> 02:08:02,090
Okay, I feel like...

2914
02:08:02,090 --> 02:08:03,070
Yeah, we need that.

2915
02:08:05,050 --> 02:08:05,770
Um...

2916
02:08:05,770 --> 02:08:06,630
And I have one more.

2917
02:08:15,310 --> 02:08:17,050
Cannot be upgraded.

2918
02:08:17,530 --> 02:08:18,310
Why not?

2919
02:08:18,550 --> 02:08:19,510
Oh, because I don't...

2920
02:08:19,510 --> 02:08:20,150
Wait, what?

2921
02:08:20,730 --> 02:08:21,450
Oh.

2922
02:08:21,870 --> 02:08:22,350
Oh!

2923
02:08:24,150 --> 02:08:24,870
Okay.

2924
02:08:25,410 --> 02:08:25,490
Okay.

2925
02:08:30,680 --> 02:08:33,100
Okay, I can put more into this.

2926
02:08:33,260 --> 02:08:33,520
Okay.

2927
02:08:34,480 --> 02:08:35,480
That makes sense.

2928
02:08:39,510 --> 02:08:40,030
Okay.

2929
02:08:40,530 --> 02:08:42,570
Sorry, I'm, like, processing my skill tree.

2930
02:08:43,390 --> 02:08:43,910
Um...

2931
02:08:43,910 --> 02:08:46,390
But yeah, you can definitely do a lot of different builds.

2932
02:08:46,670 --> 02:08:47,310
Right now.

2933
02:08:48,130 --> 02:08:49,450
I'm just doing this build.

2934
02:08:49,530 --> 02:08:49,710
Oh, wait.

2935
02:08:49,770 --> 02:08:50,010
I forgot.

2936
02:08:50,850 --> 02:08:51,470
To reset.

2937
02:08:51,830 --> 02:08:53,530
So I can have my full...

2938
02:08:53,530 --> 02:08:54,130
Man...

2939
02:08:54,130 --> 02:08:54,590
Uh...

2940
02:08:54,590 --> 02:08:55,450
Heal potions.

2941
02:08:56,750 --> 02:08:58,350
Healing is hard in this game.

2942
02:08:58,610 --> 02:08:59,690
Because, like...

2943
02:08:59,690 --> 02:09:01,430
In more so a way where...

2944
02:09:03,890 --> 02:09:04,510
Um...

2945
02:09:04,510 --> 02:09:06,010
It's not...

2946
02:09:06,010 --> 02:09:07,030
It's, like...

2947
02:09:07,030 --> 02:09:07,730
A lot slower.

2948
02:09:08,150 --> 02:09:10,330
It's a lot slower than Elder Ring.

2949
02:09:15,180 --> 02:09:16,360
Which I've noticed.

2950
02:09:20,800 --> 02:09:22,180
Let's kill this guy first.

2951
02:09:26,680 --> 02:09:27,140
Okay.

2952
02:09:28,460 --> 02:09:30,300
Yeah, it's way slower.

2953
02:09:30,460 --> 02:09:33,380
Like, I actually have to, like, find cover when it comes to healing.

2954
02:09:35,300 --> 02:09:36,680
Which I'm not used to.

2955
02:09:40,310 --> 02:09:41,170
Any items?

2956
02:09:41,330 --> 02:09:41,670
Any drops?

2957
02:09:41,870 --> 02:09:41,970
No.

2958
02:09:42,270 --> 02:09:42,550
Alright.

2959
02:09:45,490 --> 02:09:48,490
Okay, so I guess this has to be a boss fight.

2960
02:09:50,130 --> 02:09:50,630
Right?

2961
02:09:51,790 --> 02:09:52,490
Oh, yeah.

2962
02:09:52,650 --> 02:09:53,070
No, that...

2963
02:09:53,070 --> 02:09:54,910
That guy looks very boss-like.

2964
02:10:00,670 --> 02:10:02,710
This game is more like Dark Souls 1.

2965
02:10:02,950 --> 02:10:03,970
Oh, I see.

2966
02:10:11,780 --> 02:10:12,280
Oh.

2967
02:10:24,120 --> 02:10:25,340
Oh, does he have Feathered?

2968
02:10:25,480 --> 02:10:25,780
Oh.

2969
02:10:26,160 --> 02:10:27,220
He has his inner demons.

2970
02:10:27,620 --> 02:10:28,960
Oh, is he Feathered too?

2971
02:10:29,560 --> 02:10:30,980
Or he's just a demon?

2972
02:10:34,580 --> 02:10:35,140
Okay.

2973
02:10:40,720 --> 02:10:41,280
What?

2974
02:10:41,560 --> 02:10:41,840
Okay.

2975
02:10:42,120 --> 02:10:42,400
I...

2976
02:10:42,400 --> 02:10:43,900
I don't know his pattern at all.

2977
02:10:44,720 --> 02:10:45,560
Oh, my God.

2978
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:47,780
Oh, my God.

2979
02:10:50,040 --> 02:10:53,320
Okay, I don't know any of his attacks.

2980
02:10:56,400 --> 02:10:56,960
Man.

2981
02:10:57,540 --> 02:10:58,100
Okay.

2982
02:10:58,600 --> 02:10:59,160
What?

2983
02:11:01,890 --> 02:11:03,450
Yeah, his weapon is sick.

2984
02:11:04,030 --> 02:11:04,310
I don't know.

2985
02:11:04,630 --> 02:11:07,410
His attacks are, like, really hard to telegraph.

2986
02:11:07,970 --> 02:11:08,630
Other than that.

2987
02:11:08,630 --> 02:11:09,990
I mean, that one was easy.

2988
02:11:10,590 --> 02:11:11,870
That one was easy.

2989
02:11:12,910 --> 02:11:14,110
But other than that.

2990
02:11:14,470 --> 02:11:14,610
Okay.

2991
02:11:21,370 --> 02:11:21,930
Okay.

2992
02:11:26,160 --> 02:11:27,460
Jesus, what?

2993
02:11:27,800 --> 02:11:28,560
That hits me?

2994
02:11:29,800 --> 02:11:30,360
Okay.

2995
02:11:30,440 --> 02:11:31,720
Yeah, we're not winning this fight.

2996
02:11:31,720 --> 02:11:32,480
Okay.

2997
02:11:32,480 --> 02:11:33,000
Stay still.

2998
02:11:34,360 --> 02:11:36,260
You don't deserve...

2999
02:11:36,260 --> 02:11:37,680
What?

3000
02:11:38,140 --> 02:11:39,420
That hits me too?

3001
02:11:42,640 --> 02:11:43,400
Okay.

3002
02:11:43,720 --> 02:11:45,520
It's interesting what hits me, though.

3003
02:11:46,920 --> 02:11:48,180
It's interesting.

3004
02:11:48,700 --> 02:11:50,640
Because I was like, That hits me?

3005
02:11:56,590 --> 02:11:57,310
Okay.

3006
02:11:57,310 --> 02:12:01,730
Okay, like when he plants it on the ground, there's a hitbox there.

3007
02:12:03,390 --> 02:12:04,930
That's like hard.

3008
02:12:05,550 --> 02:12:05,670
Okay.

3009
02:12:08,790 --> 02:12:09,510
Okay.

3010
02:12:12,090 --> 02:12:17,590
The attack patterns are like really weird a bit.

3011
02:12:17,790 --> 02:12:17,910
Yeah.

3012
02:12:19,450 --> 02:12:21,750
Consume for greatest increase.

3013
02:12:22,790 --> 02:12:23,510
Consumes.

3014
02:12:23,670 --> 02:12:23,850
Okay.

3015
02:12:23,930 --> 02:12:24,810
Okay.

3016
02:12:24,850 --> 02:12:24,850
Okay.

3017
02:12:25,910 --> 02:12:26,430
Yeah.

3018
02:12:26,810 --> 02:12:26,930
Alright.

3019
02:12:27,190 --> 02:12:27,590
So, yeah.

3020
02:12:27,790 --> 02:12:28,790
It's AoE.

3021
02:12:29,050 --> 02:12:29,190
Okay.

3022
02:12:29,370 --> 02:12:32,650
So, his attack patterns are weird.

3023
02:12:32,990 --> 02:12:36,710
Like, it's hard to see what is the hitbox for it.

3024
02:12:37,370 --> 02:12:39,290
But I sort of get it.

3025
02:12:39,410 --> 02:12:42,530
But also like, I had to like think a little.

3026
02:12:43,190 --> 02:12:45,470
And also like, I realized because of the madness.

3027
02:12:46,390 --> 02:12:47,430
The madness.

3028
02:12:51,110 --> 02:12:53,910
The madness part makes it so I don't lose all my...

3029
02:12:53,930 --> 02:12:55,470
Uh... Mercury.

3030
02:12:57,390 --> 02:12:59,110
So, I have to be aware of that.

3031
02:12:59,410 --> 02:12:59,830
Yeah.

3032
02:13:06,280 --> 02:13:06,880
Alright.

3033
02:13:07,600 --> 02:13:08,840
Let's try this again.

3034
02:13:11,100 --> 02:13:11,700
Yeah.

3035
02:13:11,760 --> 02:13:13,440
So, you don't... You don't lose everything.

3036
02:13:13,860 --> 02:13:18,200
During your... During your fight.

3037
02:13:28,250 --> 02:13:28,730
Okay.

3038
02:13:31,490 --> 02:13:31,970
Okay.

3039
02:13:32,050 --> 02:13:32,050
Okay.

3040
02:13:32,810 --> 02:13:35,410
I feel like I can just, you know, say like...

3041
02:13:38,710 --> 02:13:39,670
Oh, shit.

3042
02:13:40,010 --> 02:13:40,310
Whoops.

3043
02:13:42,990 --> 02:13:43,790
Okay, nice.

3044
02:13:45,990 --> 02:13:46,590
That's right.

3045
02:13:46,710 --> 02:13:47,310
Mighty Dio.

3046
02:13:47,870 --> 02:13:48,350
Okay.

3047
02:13:48,590 --> 02:13:48,690
Yeah.

3048
02:13:48,790 --> 02:13:50,630
Like when he puts it... When he puts his...

3049
02:13:50,630 --> 02:13:51,730
Fucking thing down.

3050
02:13:51,850 --> 02:13:52,670
I still get hit.

3051
02:13:52,990 --> 02:13:54,330
Like, I don't expect that.

3052
02:13:57,570 --> 02:13:58,990
That fucks with me.

3053
02:14:05,080 --> 02:14:05,700
Okay.

3054
02:14:06,300 --> 02:14:07,620
Nice backstab.

3055
02:14:08,580 --> 02:14:09,200
Yeah.

3056
02:14:10,080 --> 02:14:11,420
That shit I don't like.

3057
02:14:13,920 --> 02:14:14,540
Okay.

3058
02:14:17,400 --> 02:14:18,300
Bum bub.

3059
02:14:18,520 --> 02:14:20,120
Bum bub bub bub bub bub bub.

3060
02:14:22,860 --> 02:14:23,260
Okay.

3061
02:14:23,400 --> 02:14:23,580
Nice.

3062
02:14:25,220 --> 02:14:25,860
Bum.

3063
02:14:28,460 --> 02:14:29,740
You fucker.

3064
02:14:31,300 --> 02:14:31,940
Alright.

3065
02:14:32,800 --> 02:14:33,640
Good damage though.

3066
02:14:37,750 --> 02:14:38,770
Oh my god.

3067
02:14:38,990 --> 02:14:40,530
I'm like so scared that...

3068
02:14:40,530 --> 02:14:41,370
Oh my god.

3069
02:14:41,490 --> 02:14:42,010
Are you serious?

3070
02:14:44,470 --> 02:14:45,770
Are you serious?

3071
02:14:45,910 --> 02:14:46,070
Okay.

3072
02:14:46,210 --> 02:14:46,390
Nice.

3073
02:14:50,210 --> 02:14:50,850
Nice.

3074
02:14:52,910 --> 02:14:54,910
He has fire now?

3075
02:14:55,310 --> 02:14:58,710
God, he burned everything.

3076
02:15:00,890 --> 02:15:02,150
What is he doing?

3077
02:15:02,390 --> 02:15:02,930
Fireworks?

3078
02:15:05,690 --> 02:15:07,850
Now he has fireworks?

3079
02:15:08,150 --> 02:15:09,970
Oh, this is so punishing.

3080
02:15:10,830 --> 02:15:13,590
I will say it's definitely very punishing.

3081
02:15:15,330 --> 02:15:17,810
Because I don't have a lot of healers too.

3082
02:15:24,150 --> 02:15:24,550
Okay.

3083
02:15:26,750 --> 02:15:27,150
Okay.

3084
02:15:33,500 --> 02:15:34,200
Wait, what?

3085
02:15:34,360 --> 02:15:35,100
What's the switch draw?

3086
02:15:37,120 --> 02:15:37,520
This?

3087
02:15:37,980 --> 02:15:38,340
What?

3088
02:15:38,440 --> 02:15:39,160
What am I doing?

3089
02:15:44,250 --> 02:15:44,650
Okay.

3090
02:15:47,230 --> 02:15:47,950
Oh my god.

3091
02:15:48,270 --> 02:15:48,590
Oh my god.

3092
02:15:48,770 --> 02:15:49,130
Get out.

3093
02:15:49,230 --> 02:15:49,750
Get out of here.

3094
02:15:52,950 --> 02:15:53,350
Okay.

3095
02:15:59,180 --> 02:15:59,580
Okay.

3096
02:15:59,580 --> 02:16:00,260
Okay, I have to get out though.

3097
02:16:00,580 --> 02:16:02,100
I don't have any more potions.

3098
02:16:04,100 --> 02:16:05,320
I don't know what he's doing.

3099
02:16:05,940 --> 02:16:06,340
He's...

3100
02:16:06,340 --> 02:16:06,920
He's like...

3101
02:16:06,920 --> 02:16:07,320
He has...

3102
02:16:07,320 --> 02:16:07,780
I don't...

3103
02:16:07,780 --> 02:16:08,140
Don't...

3104
02:16:08,140 --> 02:16:08,780
Oh wait.

3105
02:16:09,040 --> 02:16:09,760
He's so far away.

3106
02:16:10,340 --> 02:16:10,720
Like...

3107
02:16:10,720 --> 02:16:13,020
Okay, that has to be like too far to hit me.

3108
02:16:23,340 --> 02:16:24,960
Like, I'm worried when he does that.

3109
02:16:24,960 --> 02:16:25,960
When he puts it...

3110
02:16:25,960 --> 02:16:27,480
When he puts it down, you know?

3111
02:16:30,420 --> 02:16:31,000
Okay.

3112
02:16:35,360 --> 02:16:36,380
Okay, he's dead.

3113
02:16:37,220 --> 02:16:38,240
Holy shit.

3114
02:16:39,960 --> 02:16:41,480
So he was feathered.

3115
02:16:44,960 --> 02:16:45,960
Oh nice.

3116
02:16:47,560 --> 02:16:48,200
Look at that.

3117
02:16:48,280 --> 02:16:48,800
I did it.

3118
02:16:48,940 --> 02:16:50,040
I got less crazy.

3119
02:16:51,480 --> 02:16:52,060
Nice.

3120
02:16:52,740 --> 02:16:54,080
I got copper jug.

3121
02:16:54,780 --> 02:16:56,600
What the fuck did I get?

3122
02:16:58,440 --> 02:16:59,920
Wait, there's more?

3123
02:17:02,100 --> 02:17:03,620
It doesn't stop.

3124
02:17:03,820 --> 02:17:04,220
That's right.

3125
02:17:04,400 --> 02:17:06,180
I was like, there's more stuff?

3126
02:17:06,700 --> 02:17:07,400
Oh my god.

3127
02:17:07,640 --> 02:17:07,840
Okay.

3128
02:17:08,420 --> 02:17:11,280
Look, my brain is like expanding right now.

3129
02:17:12,620 --> 02:17:13,160
Like...

3130
02:17:14,880 --> 02:17:16,700
Alondra, welcome to Tomato Fire.

3131
02:17:16,860 --> 02:17:17,640
Welcome, welcome.

3132
02:17:18,660 --> 02:17:19,600
But wait.

3133
02:17:19,900 --> 02:17:20,940
There's more.

3134
02:17:21,320 --> 02:17:22,040
It keeps going.

3135
02:17:22,300 --> 02:17:22,740
Like...

3136
02:17:22,740 --> 02:17:24,880
I'm like, there's a new thing I gotta process.

3137
02:17:25,160 --> 02:17:25,980
Guys, give me a sec.

3138
02:17:26,600 --> 02:17:33,060
Clip onto your item hop bar and use it to endow your weapons with special effect.

3139
02:17:34,280 --> 02:17:40,520
Insert different bow needles and stone needles from within, thereby changing what type of...

3140
02:17:40,980 --> 02:17:47,320
Using specific bow needles before activating your temperance unlocks your weapon's hidden potential.

3141
02:17:47,320 --> 02:17:49,300
For March Graver...

3142
02:17:49,300 --> 02:17:49,840
Okay.

3143
02:17:50,420 --> 02:17:51,100
Um...

3144
02:17:51,100 --> 02:17:55,000
What is my weapon's hidden potential?

3145
02:17:55,800 --> 02:17:56,780
Uh...

3146
02:17:56,780 --> 02:17:58,320
Enable it to cause burn.

3147
02:17:58,540 --> 02:17:58,800
Okay.

3148
02:17:59,560 --> 02:18:00,900
Okay, cool.

3149
02:18:00,900 --> 02:18:01,960
So now...

3150
02:18:01,960 --> 02:18:04,420
True power in feathering isn't about a necessity.

3151
02:18:04,420 --> 02:18:05,560
Now I have burn.

3152
02:18:06,720 --> 02:18:08,700
It's about understanding it.

3153
02:18:09,480 --> 02:18:10,100
Okay.

3154
02:18:12,800 --> 02:18:14,700
I can now burn stuff.

3155
02:18:14,900 --> 02:18:16,480
How do I activate it though?

3156
02:18:17,400 --> 02:18:22,240
They really tell me how to activate the burn part though.

3157
02:18:23,280 --> 02:18:24,160
Discipline.

3158
02:18:26,760 --> 02:18:27,640
Use...

3159
02:18:27,640 --> 02:18:28,240
Wait, what?

3160
02:18:28,740 --> 02:18:30,320
How do I learn...

3161
02:18:30,320 --> 02:18:32,160
How do I do it?

3162
02:18:34,600 --> 02:18:35,460
Okay, here.

3163
02:18:35,600 --> 02:18:36,040
Poise break.

3164
02:18:37,180 --> 02:18:38,060
For extra...

3165
02:18:38,060 --> 02:18:39,140
Some moves have...

3166
02:18:39,140 --> 02:18:40,240
Move at deflect traits.

3167
02:18:41,600 --> 02:18:42,680
Okay, so here.

3168
02:18:44,140 --> 02:18:46,100
So like, this is how you deflect.

3169
02:18:47,340 --> 02:18:49,480
Charge, heavy attack, fleetness.

3170
02:18:52,440 --> 02:18:53,120
Uh...

3171
02:18:54,540 --> 02:18:55,220
Okay.

3172
02:18:55,740 --> 02:18:57,360
There's like one thing...

3173
02:18:59,600 --> 02:19:00,280
Where...

3174
02:19:00,280 --> 02:19:01,180
Where is the...

3175
02:19:01,180 --> 02:19:02,370
Where is the...

3176
02:19:04,920 --> 02:19:05,920
The acupuncture...

3177
02:19:05,920 --> 02:19:06,020
Shit.

3178
02:19:06,440 --> 02:19:06,940
Like...

3179
02:19:06,940 --> 02:19:07,360
Is it...

3180
02:19:07,360 --> 02:19:08,480
I don't remember what it's called.

3181
02:19:08,780 --> 02:19:09,520
They were so...

3182
02:19:10,020 --> 02:19:11,080
Oh my god.

3183
02:19:14,980 --> 02:19:15,480
Okay.

3184
02:19:17,220 --> 02:19:18,440
My brain is...

3185
02:19:18,440 --> 02:19:20,580
It's like going one ear out of the other right.

3186
02:19:20,720 --> 02:19:21,220
Oh, it's temper.

3187
02:19:21,360 --> 02:19:21,800
There we go.

3188
02:19:22,220 --> 02:19:23,740
In the tempering menu.

3189
02:19:24,300 --> 02:19:24,800
Okay.

3190
02:19:25,020 --> 02:19:25,590
How do I...

3191
02:19:31,630 --> 02:19:32,770
Okay, so...

3192
02:19:32,770 --> 02:19:34,330
I have to unlock it.

3193
02:19:34,330 --> 02:19:36,450
Okay, so I have to unlock it on my...

3194
02:19:36,450 --> 02:19:36,830
Oh my god.

3195
02:19:36,830 --> 02:19:38,290
Look at that fucking thing zoom.

3196
02:19:38,790 --> 02:19:39,310
Like...

3197
02:19:39,310 --> 02:19:40,730
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

3198
02:19:42,110 --> 02:19:42,810
Look at it.

3199
02:19:43,050 --> 02:19:44,330
Zoom so fast.

3200
02:19:44,870 --> 02:19:46,430
Oh, there's leech magic.

3201
02:19:46,430 --> 02:19:46,970
Okay.

3202
02:19:47,510 --> 02:19:48,370
I mean...

3203
02:19:48,370 --> 02:19:49,610
That's like the...

3204
02:19:49,610 --> 02:19:50,270
Vampire.

3205
02:19:50,270 --> 02:19:52,190
I like leech magic.

3206
02:19:53,430 --> 02:19:53,950
I like leech magic.

3207
02:19:53,950 --> 02:19:55,270
Leech seems good, right?

3208
02:19:58,250 --> 02:19:58,770
Okay.

3209
02:20:01,130 --> 02:20:02,170
Yeah, lifesteal.

3210
02:20:04,290 --> 02:20:05,330
I like that.

3211
02:20:05,350 --> 02:20:06,470
I like lifesteal.

3212
02:20:08,610 --> 02:20:11,450
This inner demon shit is so fucking complicated.

3213
02:20:11,870 --> 02:20:11,970
I...

3214
02:20:11,970 --> 02:20:12,670
The thing I...

3215
02:20:12,670 --> 02:20:13,790
I think like the one...

3216
02:20:13,790 --> 02:20:15,490
The one thing I don't like is...

3217
02:20:15,490 --> 02:20:16,870
It's just the inner demon.

3218
02:20:16,870 --> 02:20:17,410
Cause I'm...

3219
02:20:17,410 --> 02:20:20,070
I'm a little confused about what that is still.

3220
02:20:20,530 --> 02:20:20,890
I...

3221
02:20:20,890 --> 02:20:22,050
Ha ha ha ha ha.

3222
02:20:22,230 --> 02:20:23,350
Ha ha ha ha.

3223
02:20:23,750 --> 02:20:24,870
I'm a little...

3224
02:20:24,870 --> 02:20:26,350
I'm so confused...

3225
02:20:26,350 --> 02:20:28,790
About what he wants me to...

3226
02:20:28,790 --> 02:20:29,210
Do.

3227
02:20:33,370 --> 02:20:34,650
Cause it's like...

3228
02:20:34,650 --> 02:20:35,730
It's like...

3229
02:20:35,730 --> 02:20:36,510
The...

3230
02:20:36,510 --> 02:20:38,670
It's cause like the humans are also evil.

3231
02:20:38,670 --> 02:20:39,370
So like...

3232
02:20:39,370 --> 02:20:40,670
I shouldn't kill the humans.

3233
02:20:40,870 --> 02:20:42,310
Even if they're evil.

3234
02:20:42,510 --> 02:20:42,950
So like...

3235
02:20:42,950 --> 02:20:44,850
That's what confuses me the most.

3236
02:20:57,350 --> 02:20:57,970
Alright.

3237
02:20:58,350 --> 02:20:59,170
Well I killed him.

3238
02:21:00,010 --> 02:21:01,390
I did my job.

3239
02:21:07,930 --> 02:21:11,150
And then it punishes me for dying too much too.

3240
02:21:12,110 --> 02:21:13,170
Use it to...

3241
02:21:13,170 --> 02:21:13,970
You can start different.

3242
02:21:15,810 --> 02:21:16,430
Okay.

3243
02:21:16,590 --> 02:21:17,150
So now...

3244
02:21:17,150 --> 02:21:19,150
I should be able to...

3245
02:21:19,150 --> 02:21:20,150
Upgrade...

3246
02:21:20,150 --> 02:21:21,210
More stuff.

3247
02:21:21,210 --> 02:21:21,790
Okay.

3248
02:21:22,150 --> 02:21:23,610
I have...

3249
02:21:25,330 --> 02:21:26,370
Okay.

3250
02:21:28,490 --> 02:21:31,150
I can technically unlock vitality.

3251
02:21:31,470 --> 02:21:31,710
Okay.

3252
02:21:31,810 --> 02:21:32,050
Cool.

3253
02:21:32,430 --> 02:21:33,350
And then...

3254
02:21:38,400 --> 02:21:40,080
I can lock more...

3255
02:21:40,400 --> 02:21:41,040
Okay.

3256
02:21:41,060 --> 02:21:43,200
I can't unlock vitality.

3257
02:21:43,780 --> 02:21:44,400
Okay.

3258
02:21:45,300 --> 02:21:46,340
So...

3259
02:21:46,340 --> 02:21:49,220
We can do more Ungabunga then.

3260
02:21:51,620 --> 02:21:52,660
Okay.

3261
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:54,120
If anything...

3262
02:21:54,120 --> 02:21:54,780
Ungabunga.

3263
02:21:54,880 --> 02:21:56,040
Can save me.

3264
02:21:56,320 --> 02:21:57,740
Ha ha ha ha.

3265
02:21:58,800 --> 02:21:59,180
Ha ha ha.

3266
02:21:59,180 --> 02:21:59,380
Ha ha ha.

3267
02:21:59,380 --> 02:21:59,680
If anything...

3268
02:21:59,980 --> 02:22:01,760
We'll just have more Ungabunga.

3269
02:22:01,860 --> 02:22:02,420
It's fine.

3270
02:22:02,800 --> 02:22:03,820
Ha ha ha ha.

3271
02:22:04,540 --> 02:22:04,720
Ha ha ha.

3272
02:22:04,720 --> 02:22:06,260
Oh I don't have enough.

3273
02:22:06,460 --> 02:22:06,600
Sorry.

3274
02:22:06,740 --> 02:22:06,900
No.

3275
02:22:07,180 --> 02:22:09,180
Not enough Ungabunga.

3276
02:22:09,360 --> 02:22:09,660
Unfortunately.

3277
02:22:14,600 --> 02:22:15,200
Temper.

3278
02:22:15,500 --> 02:22:15,620
Yeah.

3279
02:22:15,760 --> 02:22:16,800
That's my...

3280
02:22:16,800 --> 02:22:17,440
My arm.

3281
02:22:18,140 --> 02:22:19,340
And then...

3282
02:22:19,340 --> 02:22:21,440
I reset my heals.

3283
02:22:21,900 --> 02:22:22,840
Did I grab the key?

3284
02:22:28,110 --> 02:22:28,710
Wait.

3285
02:22:28,710 --> 02:22:29,190
He's gone.

3286
02:22:31,970 --> 02:22:33,170
Where did he go?

3287
02:22:33,750 --> 02:22:34,190
Run?

3288
02:22:35,770 --> 02:22:36,050
Wait.

3289
02:22:36,150 --> 02:22:37,390
I didn't even get to talk to him.

3290
02:22:42,330 --> 02:22:42,830
Wait.

3291
02:22:42,950 --> 02:22:45,370
The guy that was knocking on the door is also gone.

3292
02:22:48,470 --> 02:22:48,970
Oh.

3293
02:22:49,070 --> 02:22:49,570
I got the key.

3294
02:22:49,750 --> 02:22:49,890
Okay.

3295
02:22:50,090 --> 02:22:50,210
Nice.

3296
02:22:52,390 --> 02:22:52,890
Wait.

3297
02:22:53,250 --> 02:22:54,530
What happened to him?

3298
02:23:04,620 --> 02:23:05,420
Okay.

3299
02:23:06,560 --> 02:23:07,080
Oh.

3300
02:23:07,700 --> 02:23:08,500
Oh!

3301
02:23:09,220 --> 02:23:10,600
Are these like...

3302
02:23:10,600 --> 02:23:11,500
Extra bonuses?

3303
02:23:12,300 --> 02:23:12,640
Ha ha.

3304
02:23:12,800 --> 02:23:13,080
Goodbye.

3305
02:23:13,240 --> 02:23:14,400
Oh my god.

3306
02:23:14,660 --> 02:23:15,820
That's so...

3307
02:23:15,820 --> 02:23:17,700
Holy shit.

3308
02:23:18,300 --> 02:23:18,600
Okay.

3309
02:23:18,880 --> 02:23:20,360
I like crushed the puppy.

3310
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:21,880
Oh my...

3311
02:23:21,880 --> 02:23:23,100
I'm not a bad person.

3312
02:23:23,100 --> 02:23:23,640
I swear.

3313
02:23:24,180 --> 02:23:24,680
I...

3314
02:23:24,680 --> 02:23:27,020
Oh, what the fuck?

3315
02:23:31,660 --> 02:23:34,960
Oh my god, I did not expect that.

3316
02:23:39,270 --> 02:23:42,150
He just stopped it.

3317
02:23:42,830 --> 02:23:44,070
What the, what is he?

3318
02:23:53,310 --> 02:23:55,350
Is he British?

3319
02:24:20,270 --> 02:24:20,750
Exactly!

3320
02:24:21,310 --> 02:24:21,950
That's what I'm saying!

3321
02:24:22,010 --> 02:24:23,270
I'm the bad person!

3322
02:24:23,590 --> 02:24:26,850
I have to fight my inner demons because I killed one or two monks.

3323
02:24:26,850 --> 02:24:28,890
And about the way to Doomwillow Beach...

3324
02:24:28,890 --> 02:24:30,790
Yeah, that's a very British... I was like, why is he British?

3325
02:24:31,290 --> 02:24:33,230
Somehow it caught fire and burned to the ground.

3326
02:24:33,990 --> 02:24:35,170
You can't get through now.

3327
02:24:35,670 --> 02:24:39,030
If you're headed to Doomwillow Beach, you'll have to find another route.

3328
02:24:41,350 --> 02:24:43,890
Mind if I ask why you came all the way here?

3329
02:24:45,010 --> 02:24:47,230
Have you heard the rumors about the Shu Sanctum?

3330
02:24:47,230 --> 02:24:49,090
Oh my god, right, he's from Hong Kong.

3331
02:24:51,110 --> 02:24:51,910
You're right!

3332
02:24:52,170 --> 02:24:54,050
They hidden all sorts of strange things upstairs.

3333
02:24:55,030 --> 02:24:56,370
Not that any of that interests me.

3334
02:24:57,210 --> 02:24:59,910
All I care about is finding medicine to heal my brother.

3335
02:25:00,850 --> 02:25:01,950
Oh, it's him!

3336
02:25:03,330 --> 02:25:05,190
We thought you were missing!

3337
02:25:05,190 --> 02:25:07,950
But who knew there'd be soldiers guarding the place?

3338
02:25:08,210 --> 02:25:10,910
They tossed me out before I could even explain myself.

3339
02:25:11,690 --> 02:25:14,530
They stand there like smug watchdogs.

3340
02:25:15,170 --> 02:25:17,430
Blocking anyone from getting close.

3341
02:25:18,250 --> 02:25:20,250
Matt, since I told you about the rumors...

3342
02:25:21,170 --> 02:25:24,530
Okay, I gotta grab the elixirs for him and save his brother.

3343
02:25:25,010 --> 02:25:27,810
With your skills, it should be a breeze, right?

3344
02:25:28,210 --> 02:25:30,590
That guy's just standing on top of a dead body.

3345
02:25:31,910 --> 02:25:33,450
Alright, we're gonna...

3346
02:25:33,450 --> 02:25:36,090
We're gonna steal the monks' treasure.

3347
02:25:36,510 --> 02:25:38,330
It's okay, they're evil monks.

3348
02:25:38,910 --> 02:25:39,690
Blow the whistle.

3349
02:25:40,050 --> 02:25:41,430
And I'll come to your aid.

3350
02:25:42,290 --> 02:25:42,790
Oh, shit!

3351
02:25:43,730 --> 02:25:45,310
The bone whistle.

3352
02:25:45,810 --> 02:25:46,310
How can...

3353
02:25:46,310 --> 02:25:50,870
You can blow while up to car navigate and then...

3354
02:25:50,870 --> 02:25:53,210
Okay, that's not too complicated.

3355
02:25:54,410 --> 02:25:55,670
Alright, we'll...

3356
02:25:55,670 --> 02:25:57,350
Where's the bone whistle?

3357
02:25:57,750 --> 02:25:58,110
Okay.

3358
02:25:58,950 --> 02:26:00,330
Alright, I can do that.

3359
02:26:00,550 --> 02:26:01,630
I can blow a whistle.

3360
02:26:03,490 --> 02:26:05,510
Alright, we're gonna test the whistle out.

3361
02:26:06,470 --> 02:26:07,690
Is it one time news?

3362
02:26:07,810 --> 02:26:08,330
Or like...

3363
02:26:08,330 --> 02:26:09,630
Can I use it multiple times?

3364
02:26:09,730 --> 02:26:10,230
Well, we'll...

3365
02:26:10,230 --> 02:26:10,810
We'll see.

3366
02:26:12,750 --> 02:26:13,550
Let's see.

3367
02:26:16,070 --> 02:26:20,830
Blessed by the primordial deity, the High Priest has procured healing at Glixxers.

3368
02:26:21,030 --> 02:26:25,910
His elephant brother will distribute it, one for each, so let no discourse arise in these trying times.

3369
02:26:26,150 --> 02:26:26,290
Okay.

3370
02:26:27,650 --> 02:26:27,990
Alright.

3371
02:26:29,950 --> 02:26:30,650
Uh...

3372
02:26:30,650 --> 02:26:30,970
Yoink!

3373
02:26:33,010 --> 02:26:33,570
Are you...

3374
02:26:33,570 --> 02:26:35,050
Here for the High Priest?

3375
02:26:35,790 --> 02:26:37,790
You'd be wiser just to leave.

3376
02:26:38,210 --> 02:26:39,850
The High Priest's ill.

3377
02:26:40,270 --> 02:26:41,850
Can't save anyone.

3378
02:26:42,610 --> 02:26:44,030
Look around you.

3379
02:26:45,410 --> 02:26:47,350
Everyone came for healing.

3380
02:26:47,750 --> 02:26:50,110
But now, they're all monsters.

3381
02:26:50,390 --> 02:26:51,830
Technically, there's nobody here.

3382
02:26:51,970 --> 02:26:52,650
Thankfully...

3383
02:26:52,650 --> 02:26:53,750
Because I killed them all.

3384
02:26:53,750 --> 02:26:57,450
That officer showed up right on time to defend us.

3385
02:26:58,410 --> 02:26:59,050
Or...

3386
02:26:59,050 --> 02:27:00,510
We'd all be dead.

3387
02:27:00,770 --> 02:27:03,890
He even warned us to avoid the Shu Sanctum.

3388
02:27:04,550 --> 02:27:05,790
But now...

3389
02:27:05,790 --> 02:27:07,310
He's suffering too.

3390
02:27:08,530 --> 02:27:10,750
All because he wanted to protect us.

3391
02:27:10,830 --> 02:27:11,450
Oh!

3392
02:27:11,850 --> 02:27:13,690
He's suffering from the Feathering.

3393
02:27:15,050 --> 02:27:18,330
And only the Imperial Court still remembers us.

3394
02:27:18,410 --> 02:27:19,070
Oh, I should...

3395
02:27:19,070 --> 02:27:20,070
Oh, is it like a summon?

3396
02:27:20,470 --> 02:27:22,050
I should save it for a boss fight?

3397
02:27:23,750 --> 02:27:27,710
If you're determined to go to the Shu Sanctum, take the long path around.

3398
02:27:29,550 --> 02:27:30,110
Here...

3399
02:27:30,110 --> 02:27:31,330
Take this medicine.

3400
02:27:32,110 --> 02:27:35,130
The High Priest said it might help with the Feathering.

3401
02:27:35,610 --> 02:27:38,030
I don't know if it'll work, but...

3402
02:27:38,030 --> 02:27:40,070
It has brought me some comfort.

3403
02:27:41,450 --> 02:27:44,010
Best to take it one day at a time.

3404
02:27:45,370 --> 02:27:45,930
Okay.

3405
02:27:46,230 --> 02:27:46,550
Nice!

3406
02:27:46,730 --> 02:27:47,090
Free stuff!

3407
02:27:47,730 --> 02:27:48,890
Okay, so...

3408
02:27:48,890 --> 02:27:49,750
I got...

3409
02:27:50,730 --> 02:27:52,070
What did he give me?

3410
02:27:52,230 --> 02:27:53,510
The Raven medicine?

3411
02:27:55,250 --> 02:27:57,690
Restores a small amount of HP.

3412
02:27:57,870 --> 02:27:58,930
Well, it's nice that like...

3413
02:27:58,930 --> 02:27:59,890
My heal...

3414
02:27:59,890 --> 02:28:01,130
My flask...

3415
02:28:01,130 --> 02:28:02,170
Uh...

3416
02:28:02,570 --> 02:28:03,750
Oh my god...

3417
02:28:09,950 --> 02:28:11,070
That arm...

3418
02:28:11,070 --> 02:28:13,050
Like, I don't even want to touch my own arm.

3419
02:28:14,030 --> 02:28:15,310
It's like...

3420
02:28:15,310 --> 02:28:16,370
Is that my arm?

3421
02:28:16,850 --> 02:28:18,150
Like, I'm like...

3422
02:28:18,150 --> 02:28:19,050
Oh my god...

3423
02:28:20,030 --> 02:28:21,910
That looks fucked up.

3424
02:28:22,410 --> 02:28:23,070
Like...

3425
02:28:23,070 --> 02:28:24,610
I'm just looking at my arm.

3426
02:28:24,810 --> 02:28:25,490
I'm like...

3427
02:28:25,490 --> 02:28:27,450
What the fuck is wrong with it?

3428
02:28:36,410 --> 02:28:37,810
Looks like I have like...

3429
02:28:38,590 --> 02:28:39,230
Like...

3430
02:28:39,230 --> 02:28:39,870
What is it called?

3431
02:28:41,110 --> 02:28:42,150
Leprosy.

3432
02:28:46,720 --> 02:28:47,760
Whoa.

3433
02:28:49,900 --> 02:28:51,140
Oh shit!

3434
02:28:51,640 --> 02:28:52,940
Oh wait, he's crazy!

3435
02:28:53,880 --> 02:28:54,800
Okay.

3436
02:28:57,980 --> 02:28:58,520
Okay.

3437
02:28:58,680 --> 02:28:59,040
Okay!

3438
02:28:59,840 --> 02:29:00,880
What?!

3439
02:29:00,880 --> 02:29:02,980
What is that range?!

3440
02:29:04,740 --> 02:29:07,560
Never mind, you ruined it.

3441
02:29:07,560 --> 02:29:08,740
Oh my god!

3442
02:29:09,380 --> 02:29:10,600
They're so tanky!

3443
02:29:12,700 --> 02:29:14,700
Yeah, that gets a crazy range.

3444
02:29:17,720 --> 02:29:18,200
That...

3445
02:29:18,200 --> 02:29:21,100
That had like huge range and damage too.

3446
02:29:26,600 --> 02:29:28,280
I couldn't even process it.

3447
02:29:28,320 --> 02:29:30,400
I didn't think like he'd do that much to me.

3448
02:29:31,360 --> 02:29:32,180
Oh shit.

3449
02:29:32,440 --> 02:29:32,620
Whoops.

3450
02:29:32,840 --> 02:29:33,860
Almost went the wrong way.

3451
02:29:37,320 --> 02:29:38,140
I'll still look...

3452
02:29:38,140 --> 02:29:39,580
To be fair, I was still looking at my arm.

3453
02:29:39,740 --> 02:29:40,120
Like I...

3454
02:29:41,740 --> 02:29:44,180
The arm was like a huge deal to me.

3455
02:29:44,360 --> 02:29:44,960
To be fair.

3456
02:29:47,040 --> 02:29:48,020
I was like...

3457
02:29:48,020 --> 02:29:49,640
What the fuck is wrong with my arm?

3458
02:29:56,210 --> 02:29:57,130
Okay, um...

3459
02:29:57,130 --> 02:29:59,050
Okay, we'll try to do the arm shit again.

3460
02:30:07,420 --> 02:30:09,400
Okay, that's just a regular person.

3461
02:30:09,640 --> 02:30:10,760
So we gotta fight this guy.

3462
02:30:13,420 --> 02:30:13,880
Oh!

3463
02:30:13,980 --> 02:30:14,480
He was like...

3464
02:30:14,480 --> 02:30:15,520
You gotta take the long path.

3465
02:30:15,660 --> 02:30:16,180
And I...

3466
02:30:16,680 --> 02:30:17,740
Decided not to listen.

3467
02:30:19,180 --> 02:30:20,100
Like right now.

3468
02:30:22,020 --> 02:30:23,120
Okay, now I know.

3469
02:30:23,500 --> 02:30:24,860
Now I know why he was like...

3470
02:30:24,860 --> 02:30:26,200
You should take the long path.

3471
02:30:26,640 --> 02:30:29,280
He was just...

3472
02:30:30,620 --> 02:30:30,980
Like...

3473
02:30:31,480 --> 02:30:31,840
Holy...

3474
02:30:31,840 --> 02:30:32,220
Okay, wait.

3475
02:30:32,280 --> 02:30:33,020
No, I can kill him.

3476
02:30:33,260 --> 02:30:34,380
No, I can kill him.

3477
02:30:34,560 --> 02:30:36,420
I might have to fight my inner demons.

3478
02:30:36,460 --> 02:30:37,560
But I can kill him.

3479
02:30:39,000 --> 02:30:40,400
How does this compare to Wukong?

3480
02:30:40,400 --> 02:30:41,680
Wukong was less souls-like.

3481
02:30:41,880 --> 02:30:42,380
This is...

3482
02:30:42,380 --> 02:30:44,340
More souls- This is more souls-like for sure.

3483
02:30:50,020 --> 02:30:52,520
I-I think I can- I think I can kill him.

3484
02:30:52,980 --> 02:30:55,940
I just have to definitely play a lot more careful.

3485
02:30:57,860 --> 02:31:00,400
Like I did like one-third the damage already.

3486
02:31:09,390 --> 02:31:11,930
Oh, is that Guan Yun's weapon?

3487
02:31:16,670 --> 02:31:19,130
I feel like my inner demon's gonna show up.

3488
02:31:19,270 --> 02:31:19,550
I...

3489
02:31:19,550 --> 02:31:22,250
I feel like she's gonna show up any moment.

3490
02:31:22,530 --> 02:31:23,030
Wait.

3491
02:31:23,270 --> 02:31:23,850
Oh, yeah.

3492
02:31:23,930 --> 02:31:24,570
No, she's here.

3493
02:31:24,770 --> 02:31:25,290
She's...

3494
02:31:27,930 --> 02:31:29,410
She's definitely here.

3495
02:31:29,850 --> 02:31:30,370
Oh, no.

3496
02:31:30,450 --> 02:31:32,370
She's guarding my runes, isn't she?

3497
02:31:34,990 --> 02:31:35,910
Oh, no.

3498
02:31:35,910 --> 02:31:37,390
I feel like she's guarding it.

3499
02:31:41,280 --> 02:31:43,220
Oh, she's definitely here.

3500
02:31:43,500 --> 02:31:45,500
Oh, I know she's here.

3501
02:31:45,700 --> 02:31:46,900
Ha ha ha ha.

3502
02:31:56,140 --> 02:31:56,920
Ha ha ha.

3503
02:32:02,440 --> 02:32:03,000
Okay.

3504
02:32:07,040 --> 02:32:07,720
That's right.

3505
02:32:07,960 --> 02:32:08,520
Swing!

3506
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:10,560
Okay.

3507
02:32:10,820 --> 02:32:11,360
Oh, shit.

3508
02:32:11,800 --> 02:32:12,080
Okay.

3509
02:32:12,140 --> 02:32:12,700
I need a heal though.

3510
02:32:13,800 --> 02:32:14,860
It's so slow.

3511
02:32:15,080 --> 02:32:16,600
The heals are so slow.

3512
02:32:16,760 --> 02:32:17,680
That's the only thing I don't like.

3513
02:32:18,500 --> 02:32:19,220
Okay, to be fair.

3514
02:32:19,300 --> 02:32:20,560
There was a lot, but...

3515
02:32:20,560 --> 02:32:21,160
Not a lot?

3516
02:32:21,340 --> 02:32:21,600
Wait, no.

3517
02:32:21,660 --> 02:32:22,360
That's not the right way.

3518
02:32:22,620 --> 02:32:24,980
There were some things I don't like, but...

3519
02:32:26,760 --> 02:32:28,500
I don't think the heals being really...

3520
02:32:30,940 --> 02:32:31,340
Okay.

3521
02:32:32,500 --> 02:32:33,760
I would say there's a lot.

3522
02:32:34,260 --> 02:32:36,260
I just don't like how slow the heals are.

3523
02:32:38,500 --> 02:32:38,900
Alright.

3524
02:32:39,140 --> 02:32:40,900
We have better armor now.

3525
02:32:41,660 --> 02:32:43,280
Where did I...

3526
02:32:43,540 --> 02:32:44,080
Okay, there.

3527
02:32:47,120 --> 02:32:47,880
Nice.

3528
02:32:48,340 --> 02:32:49,480
I got Ming armor.

3529
02:32:50,060 --> 02:32:50,860
That's right.

3530
02:32:50,860 --> 02:32:51,680
I'm her.

3531
02:32:52,800 --> 02:32:54,220
I'm you now.

3532
02:32:58,090 --> 02:32:58,970
Fuck it.

3533
02:32:59,170 --> 02:33:00,410
I'm fully you.

3534
02:33:01,110 --> 02:33:02,130
That's right.

3535
02:33:02,370 --> 02:33:03,790
Look at my drip.

3536
02:33:05,330 --> 02:33:06,270
How do I get that?

3537
02:33:12,420 --> 02:33:13,340
Oh, whoa.

3538
02:33:15,440 --> 02:33:16,400
Oh, cool.

3539
02:33:18,120 --> 02:33:18,760
Alright.

3540
02:33:19,200 --> 02:33:20,800
Okay, so I can only use...

3541
02:33:20,800 --> 02:33:21,340
Oh my god.

3542
02:33:21,400 --> 02:33:22,020
That's poison.

3543
02:33:22,700 --> 02:33:25,820
I just like walked right into it.

3544
02:33:33,440 --> 02:33:34,120
Okay.

3545
02:33:35,540 --> 02:33:36,880
That was so bad.

3546
02:33:41,480 --> 02:33:44,000
Yeah, I look fucking cool as hell now.

3547
02:33:48,030 --> 02:33:50,270
Wait, was this supposed to be the long way?

3548
02:33:50,730 --> 02:33:52,290
I assume like...

3549
02:33:52,290 --> 02:33:54,750
This was supposed to be the long way.

3550
02:33:55,270 --> 02:33:56,870
I mean, he wasn't that hard.

3551
02:33:56,870 --> 02:33:57,810
That's the thing.

3552
02:33:58,630 --> 02:34:01,070
That guy wasn't even that hard.

3553
02:34:08,840 --> 02:34:09,980
To be fair.

3554
02:34:09,980 --> 02:34:10,000
Where?

3555
02:34:11,700 --> 02:34:12,980
Did he have a cape?

3556
02:34:13,300 --> 02:34:13,980
I don't...

3557
02:34:13,980 --> 02:34:15,240
I can't equip anything else though.

3558
02:34:22,440 --> 02:34:23,780
Oh my god.

3559
02:34:23,960 --> 02:34:26,040
Please tell me there's a...

3560
02:34:26,780 --> 02:34:27,160
Shrine...

3561
02:34:27,160 --> 02:34:27,840
Anywhere?

3562
02:34:30,660 --> 02:34:31,540
No shrine?

3563
02:34:33,720 --> 02:34:34,560
Oh my god.

3564
02:34:34,800 --> 02:34:35,880
There's no shrine.

3565
02:34:37,560 --> 02:34:39,720
I have so many.

3566
02:34:40,660 --> 02:34:41,040
Mercury.

3567
02:34:45,040 --> 02:34:46,660
How's the game so far?

3568
02:34:47,080 --> 02:34:47,680
Oh, compass.

3569
02:34:49,960 --> 02:34:51,100
Yellow markers.

3570
02:34:51,420 --> 02:34:52,580
Shrines are yet to pay at...

3571
02:34:52,580 --> 02:34:53,720
Oh my...

3572
02:34:54,960 --> 02:34:55,580
Okay.

3573
02:34:55,960 --> 02:34:56,580
Okay, now...

3574
02:34:56,580 --> 02:34:58,080
I like how it tells me...

3575
02:34:58,080 --> 02:34:58,820
What...

3576
02:34:58,820 --> 02:35:00,440
What my compass means.

3577
02:35:00,640 --> 02:35:00,820
Okay.

3578
02:35:01,220 --> 02:35:02,240
Yellow is talk.

3579
02:35:02,540 --> 02:35:03,520
Red is...

3580
02:35:03,520 --> 02:35:05,540
Okay, now I understand the compass.

3581
02:35:06,560 --> 02:35:08,520
Okay, red equals shrine.

3582
02:35:15,760 --> 02:35:16,880
Okay, there's...

3583
02:35:16,880 --> 02:35:18,640
The person I have to talk to.

3584
02:35:18,880 --> 02:35:20,320
Oh, it's a safe place!

3585
02:35:20,660 --> 02:35:21,100
Oh!

3586
02:35:21,420 --> 02:35:22,640
It's a safe place!

3587
02:35:22,900 --> 02:35:23,160
Okay.

3588
02:35:23,480 --> 02:35:24,300
I made it.

3589
02:35:26,440 --> 02:35:28,360
I made it to the safe place.

3590
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:34,640
Okay.

3591
02:35:36,140 --> 02:35:38,440
I guess it's time...

3592
02:35:39,100 --> 02:35:40,260
To level...

3593
02:35:40,260 --> 02:35:40,920
This...

3594
02:35:40,920 --> 02:35:41,320
Up?

3595
02:35:51,600 --> 02:35:52,240
Like...

3596
02:35:54,480 --> 02:35:55,000
This...

3597
02:35:55,000 --> 02:35:55,080
Like...

3598
02:35:55,080 --> 02:35:57,160
These, I don't really understand that much.

3599
02:35:57,480 --> 02:36:00,240
I don't really understand what this...

3600
02:36:01,040 --> 02:36:01,560
Okay.

3601
02:36:05,030 --> 02:36:05,550
Up...

3602
02:36:05,550 --> 02:36:06,350
Up, up, up, up...

3603
02:36:06,350 --> 02:36:07,990
This one is more complex.

3604
02:36:08,170 --> 02:36:09,970
This- This part of the skill tree...

3605
02:36:09,970 --> 02:36:11,450
I'm not like fully understanding.

3606
02:36:16,260 --> 02:36:17,440
Look, this is like...

3607
02:36:17,440 --> 02:36:18,480
I guess like magic?

3608
02:36:33,130 --> 02:36:34,170
I guess...

3609
02:36:35,790 --> 02:36:37,110
Oh, you guys can't read it.

3610
02:36:37,250 --> 02:36:37,990
Oh, fuck.

3611
02:36:38,170 --> 02:36:38,450
Oh, yeah.

3612
02:36:38,770 --> 02:36:41,030
Maybe I should try to be... Wait, let's look at...

3613
02:36:42,050 --> 02:36:43,590
Okay, this is awkward.

3614
02:36:44,830 --> 02:36:47,550
This is awkward, because I can't be left side doki.

3615
02:36:47,950 --> 02:36:51,910
I can't be left side doki for you guys.

3616
02:36:53,010 --> 02:36:54,990
We'll just get vitality, fuck it.

3617
02:36:55,910 --> 02:36:57,750
We'll just get vitality, guys.

3618
02:37:11,600 --> 02:37:12,020
Yeah.

3619
02:37:18,620 --> 02:37:19,300
Okay.

3620
02:37:20,080 --> 02:37:21,620
I could... You know what?

3621
02:37:21,660 --> 02:37:22,960
I could level up a lot, actually.

3622
02:37:23,300 --> 02:37:25,020
Because I have all of these.

3623
02:37:27,680 --> 02:37:28,360
Right?

3624
02:37:31,400 --> 02:37:32,080
Okay.

3625
02:37:32,500 --> 02:37:35,620
It's like, I assume these are like... I could freely use this.

3626
02:37:36,900 --> 02:37:39,620
And I have a lot of... Mercury now.

3627
02:37:41,560 --> 02:37:42,740
There's 200.

3628
02:37:43,820 --> 02:37:46,140
They give us a lot of Mercury.

3629
02:37:48,520 --> 02:37:49,280
Which I've noticed.

3630
02:37:49,840 --> 02:37:51,220
Because I have a lot of these.

3631
02:38:00,050 --> 02:38:01,330
And then...

3632
02:38:02,010 --> 02:38:02,650
Uh...

3633
02:38:07,280 --> 02:38:10,020
I guess I'll go with...

3634
02:38:10,680 --> 02:38:13,040
I don't need to do any blocking, though.

3635
02:38:20,610 --> 02:38:21,890
Okay, uh...

3636
02:38:21,890 --> 02:38:23,170
We'll do Endurance.

3637
02:38:25,310 --> 02:38:26,830
And then we'll use Strength.

3638
02:38:27,490 --> 02:38:28,090
Ungabunga.

3639
02:38:40,320 --> 02:38:40,920
Ungabunga.

3640
02:38:41,920 --> 02:38:42,220
Ungabunga.

3641
02:38:44,920 --> 02:38:47,080
I see, like, different abilities.

3642
02:38:47,080 --> 02:38:48,000
And I'm just, like...

3643
02:38:48,000 --> 02:38:48,620
Damage.

3644
02:38:49,000 --> 02:38:49,660
I'm just...

3645
02:38:49,660 --> 02:38:50,940
I'm just gonna do damage.

3646
02:38:56,320 --> 02:38:56,940
All right.

3647
02:38:57,120 --> 02:38:57,860
We'll talk to him.

3648
02:38:58,620 --> 02:38:59,740
Just call me with that whistle.

3649
02:38:59,940 --> 02:39:01,360
And I'll be at your beck and call.

3650
02:39:03,260 --> 02:39:03,920
All right.

3651
02:39:04,140 --> 02:39:04,440
Cool.

3652
02:39:06,780 --> 02:39:09,080
Can only be open with the Shoe Sanctum Key.

3653
02:39:10,580 --> 02:39:11,040
Hey!

3654
02:39:11,740 --> 02:39:12,560
Oh, it's him!

3655
02:39:14,820 --> 02:39:15,280
Oh!

3656
02:39:15,280 --> 02:39:15,400
Oh!

3657
02:39:20,270 --> 02:39:21,870
Okay, this one's clearly better.

3658
02:39:22,110 --> 02:39:22,610
Oh my gosh.

3659
02:39:22,690 --> 02:39:23,210
Wait, is it?

3660
02:39:24,610 --> 02:39:25,950
Does it have a comparison?

3661
02:39:28,030 --> 02:39:29,070
It's so hard to tell.

3662
02:39:29,190 --> 02:39:30,690
Because there's no comparison for it.

3663
02:39:30,810 --> 02:39:31,470
So I can't...

3664
02:39:31,470 --> 02:39:32,770
Tell if it's...

3665
02:39:32,770 --> 02:39:32,950
Better.

3666
02:39:44,010 --> 02:39:45,350
Mine's plus one, too.

3667
02:39:46,850 --> 02:39:47,490
There's no...

3668
02:39:47,490 --> 02:39:48,450
Unless, like...

3669
02:39:48,450 --> 02:39:49,750
Oh, maybe they...

3670
02:39:52,150 --> 02:39:52,950
Okay, wait.

3671
02:39:53,010 --> 02:39:54,470
We should give him the...

3672
02:39:54,470 --> 02:39:55,550
Yeah, mine's plus one.

3673
02:39:55,710 --> 02:39:56,930
Okay, mine is the same, then.

3674
02:39:56,970 --> 02:39:57,150
You made it.

3675
02:39:57,350 --> 02:39:58,690
Now, that's a fine.

3676
02:39:58,810 --> 02:40:04,030
It took quite the effort to get this out from the treasure hoard under the Shoe Sanctum.

3677
02:40:04,890 --> 02:40:07,010
Dootanga always kept a sharp eye on it.

3678
02:40:07,590 --> 02:40:14,210
Since you've shown you're serious, I'll show you something rare, never seen by anyone else.

3679
02:40:14,350 --> 02:40:14,490
Oh?

3680
02:40:15,010 --> 02:40:18,210
Not to brag, but my stuff.

3681
02:40:18,210 --> 02:40:22,670
Rare grave goods plucked straight off their bodies.

3682
02:40:23,530 --> 02:40:27,490
Most folks don't live long enough to enjoy the spoils.

3683
02:40:27,930 --> 02:40:30,530
But you've got the guts and control to handle it.

3684
02:40:31,110 --> 02:40:36,230
I'm in a good mood today, so I'll show you some real treasure from the graves.

3685
02:40:36,750 --> 02:40:39,350
Consider it a gift from your new friend.

3686
02:40:40,090 --> 02:40:43,570
Hey, if you come across anything good, don't forget...

3687
02:40:43,570 --> 02:40:44,570
What does he give me, though?

3688
02:40:46,190 --> 02:40:47,010
Wait, what?

3689
02:40:47,170 --> 02:40:47,530
That's it?

3690
02:40:47,530 --> 02:40:49,150
Are you sure you don't want to have it?

3691
02:40:50,550 --> 02:40:53,070
The fuck is my... my cut?

3692
02:40:54,230 --> 02:40:56,330
I show you my ball, respond.

3693
02:40:58,570 --> 02:40:59,650
Like... what?

3694
02:41:00,750 --> 02:41:02,470
They didn't give me anything.

3695
02:41:02,470 --> 02:41:03,550
Silence.

3696
02:41:04,250 --> 02:41:04,970
Disciples.

3697
02:41:05,390 --> 02:41:06,530
Say no more.

3698
02:41:08,690 --> 02:41:10,070
The underground palace.

3699
02:41:11,230 --> 02:41:13,470
I should never have led you up there.

3700
02:41:15,090 --> 02:41:16,450
Lu Hong Liu.

3701
02:41:17,130 --> 02:41:18,270
Oh, whoops.

3702
02:41:19,210 --> 02:41:20,130
Lu Hong Liu.

3703
02:41:21,670 --> 02:41:27,410
I like how, like, if I skip the dialogue, she'll go back to the place where I skipped it.

3704
02:41:27,850 --> 02:41:28,650
Which is nice.

3705
02:41:29,170 --> 02:41:30,630
Oh, she... he has new stuff to buy.

3706
02:41:30,830 --> 02:41:31,450
Oh, he does!

3707
02:41:31,550 --> 02:41:32,170
Oh, sorry.

3708
02:41:33,010 --> 02:41:34,470
I didn't mean that earlier.

3709
02:41:34,470 --> 02:41:36,470
I didn't realize that, uh...

3710
02:41:37,010 --> 02:41:38,330
I didn't realize you had...

3711
02:41:38,330 --> 02:41:39,810
You had more dialogue.

3712
02:41:40,450 --> 02:41:40,730
I...

3713
02:41:42,450 --> 02:41:45,170
I didn't realize that, like, you giving me more stuff.

3714
02:41:45,490 --> 02:41:45,990
Sorry, buddy.

3715
02:41:46,350 --> 02:41:47,430
What treasures do you have for me today?

3716
02:41:47,870 --> 02:41:49,330
Let me make an assessment.

3717
02:41:52,310 --> 02:41:52,830
Oh.

3718
02:41:53,210 --> 02:41:54,270
Okay, what's this?

3719
02:41:59,410 --> 02:42:01,610
Okay, I have...

3720
02:42:01,610 --> 02:42:03,290
I have a copper jug.

3721
02:42:17,090 --> 02:42:17,610
Oh.

3722
02:42:25,090 --> 02:42:25,730
Yeah?

3723
02:42:26,250 --> 02:42:27,530
She was already married.

3724
02:42:27,730 --> 02:42:28,710
And had twins.

3725
02:42:29,130 --> 02:42:29,170
Oh.

3726
02:42:29,490 --> 02:42:30,450
But did that stop him?

3727
02:42:30,810 --> 02:42:32,450
Not in the slightest.

3728
02:42:33,090 --> 02:42:34,490
He was there daily.

3729
02:42:35,050 --> 02:42:39,810
When chaos erupted in town, Dootanga kidnapped her.

3730
02:42:40,250 --> 02:42:42,990
Left those poor kids without parents.

3731
02:42:43,310 --> 02:42:44,050
Oh my god!

3732
02:42:44,470 --> 02:42:46,470
What a cruel twist of fate.

3733
02:42:46,930 --> 02:42:47,930
That's so fucked up!

3734
02:42:48,010 --> 02:42:49,510
Just cause he couldn't, like, have it.

3735
02:42:50,050 --> 02:42:52,670
And then I get his fucking face?

3736
02:42:52,670 --> 02:42:53,670
Oh my...

3737
02:42:55,330 --> 02:42:56,530
That's crazy!

3738
02:42:56,950 --> 02:42:59,570
After he told me that story, he, like...

3739
02:42:59,570 --> 02:43:03,210
You can buy a fucking mask made out of skin.

3740
02:43:03,670 --> 02:43:05,530
Out of human skin!

3741
02:43:06,370 --> 02:43:07,390
Holy shit!

3742
02:43:07,810 --> 02:43:09,010
And eyes!

3743
02:43:09,290 --> 02:43:10,750
Oh my god!

3744
02:43:11,430 --> 02:43:12,850
That's crazy!

3745
02:43:13,690 --> 02:43:14,590
Wait, is mine...

3746
02:43:14,590 --> 02:43:16,090
Mine's blunt, right?

3747
02:43:18,690 --> 02:43:21,030
Made out of human eyes?

3748
02:43:21,130 --> 02:43:22,110
Let's take it.

3749
02:43:22,230 --> 02:43:22,530
Fuck it.

3750
02:43:22,670 --> 02:43:23,210
Let's buy it.

3751
02:43:23,690 --> 02:43:25,810
If you've got more than you need...

3752
02:43:25,810 --> 02:43:27,330
Now that's drip!

3753
02:43:27,850 --> 02:43:28,790
Ha ha ha ha ha!

3754
02:43:31,270 --> 02:43:32,510
Yeah, but I don't use ma...

3755
02:43:32,510 --> 02:43:33,670
Okay, this is...

3756
02:43:34,250 --> 02:43:35,490
Yeah, it's blunt.

3757
02:43:35,990 --> 02:43:36,530
Okay.

3758
02:43:37,530 --> 02:43:38,550
Okay, it's...

3759
02:43:38,550 --> 02:43:40,790
That's more blunt than stab.

3760
02:43:41,450 --> 02:43:42,690
Okay, so...

3761
02:43:42,690 --> 02:43:44,670
I guess it's time to work...

3762
02:43:47,830 --> 02:43:49,850
Does that make it up for it?

3763
02:43:55,210 --> 02:43:55,810
Does that make it up for it?

3764
02:43:55,810 --> 02:43:56,390
I should...

3765
02:43:56,390 --> 02:43:57,130
Uh...

3766
02:43:57,130 --> 02:43:57,850
Not that good.

3767
02:43:58,370 --> 02:44:00,390
My friendship bracelet!

3768
02:44:00,750 --> 02:44:01,690
Ha ha ha ha!

3769
02:44:01,770 --> 02:44:03,010
Okay, what does it look like?

3770
02:44:04,390 --> 02:44:06,630
Oh, you can barely tell its eyes.

3771
02:44:06,870 --> 02:44:07,690
No fun.

3772
02:44:07,690 --> 02:44:09,170
Ha ha ha ha!

3773
02:44:09,990 --> 02:44:10,630
Ha ha ha ha!

3774
02:44:10,630 --> 02:44:10,710
Ha ha ha ha!

3775
02:44:11,750 --> 02:44:12,890
You can barely tell.

3776
02:44:13,930 --> 02:44:15,370
I like to see...

3777
02:44:15,370 --> 02:44:17,770
I like it when it's more noticeable.

3778
02:44:27,050 --> 02:44:28,210
Hello, Granny.

3779
02:44:28,670 --> 02:44:29,210
My son.

3780
02:44:30,250 --> 02:44:31,370
Is it really you?

3781
02:44:31,550 --> 02:44:32,170
Yeah, it's me.

3782
02:44:33,290 --> 02:44:34,230
Oh, Lynn.

3783
02:44:34,510 --> 02:44:36,030
You foolish boy.

3784
02:44:36,870 --> 02:44:39,370
I gave you this charm to protect you.

3785
02:44:39,390 --> 02:44:40,250
Oh, she's blind.

3786
02:44:40,930 --> 02:44:42,470
You're returning it to me.

3787
02:44:42,470 --> 02:44:43,650
I...

3788
02:44:43,650 --> 02:44:44,470
I...

3789
02:44:45,030 --> 02:44:46,490
It's no good anymore.

3790
02:44:47,030 --> 02:44:48,270
Here, take this white stead.

3791
02:44:48,590 --> 02:44:48,990
New mom!

3792
02:44:50,290 --> 02:44:53,350
I beseeched our ancestors for this...

3793
02:44:53,350 --> 02:44:53,710
Some...

3794
02:44:54,270 --> 02:44:55,410
Time ago.

3795
02:44:56,590 --> 02:44:58,930
Offer it at their shrine.

3796
02:44:59,330 --> 02:45:04,090
And it'll ease your spirit to shield you from evil.

3797
02:45:04,670 --> 02:45:05,550
Oh, that's like a gift.

3798
02:45:05,570 --> 02:45:09,770
You joined those towers for that exorcism at the Lord Courtland, didn't you?

3799
02:45:09,770 --> 02:45:09,810
Yay!

3800
02:45:10,370 --> 02:45:11,270
My second mom!

3801
02:45:11,270 --> 02:45:12,110
Let's go!

3802
02:45:12,450 --> 02:45:14,550
If I collect all the moms...

3803
02:45:15,890 --> 02:45:17,990
Stealing from the blind!

3804
02:45:18,330 --> 02:45:19,670
That's a new low!

3805
02:45:20,190 --> 02:45:22,270
As for that Lu Hongyu...

3806
02:45:22,790 --> 02:45:26,410
She's become a man-eating fiend!

3807
02:45:27,010 --> 02:45:32,350
Do you even understand how much I worry for you?

3808
02:45:35,110 --> 02:45:39,770
If only official Bai was still alive...

3809
02:45:39,770 --> 02:45:44,710
That monster would've been dealt with long ago...

3810
02:45:46,770 --> 02:45:47,410
But...

3811
02:45:47,410 --> 02:45:53,030
Lu Hongyu has her father to thank for what she's become...

3812
02:45:53,030 --> 02:45:54,450
Yeah, fuck her!

3813
02:45:54,730 --> 02:45:56,070
Her father, back when he was the coroner...

3814
02:45:56,450 --> 02:45:59,350
Raised her on the flesh and bones of the dead!

3815
02:45:59,530 --> 02:46:02,270
No wonder she turned into such a creature!

3816
02:46:03,010 --> 02:46:08,270
I heard from the townest priest that she gnaws on some small, strange meat...

3817
02:46:09,370 --> 02:46:11,570
And no matter how she is, it's never finished!

3818
02:46:11,570 --> 02:46:15,230
Is she the half-naked bird lady in the trailer?

3819
02:46:15,230 --> 02:46:17,870
A white jade dumpling!

3820
02:46:18,430 --> 02:46:21,570
A cure for every illness, they say!

3821
02:46:22,550 --> 02:46:25,490
If only I could have a taste of it!

3822
02:46:26,090 --> 02:46:28,090
I'd be as healthy as ever!

3823
02:46:28,350 --> 02:46:31,510
No longer a burden to you, my dear child!

3824
02:46:31,910 --> 02:46:32,590
Of course!

3825
02:46:32,590 --> 02:46:33,970
I'm your new son!

3826
02:46:34,350 --> 02:46:34,930
That's me!

3827
02:46:34,930 --> 02:46:36,850
Stay here!

3828
02:46:38,030 --> 02:46:41,750
I'll pray to the gods to protect us!

3829
02:46:42,590 --> 02:46:43,750
Don't worry!

3830
02:46:44,550 --> 02:46:46,470
I'm technically him now!

3831
02:46:47,910 --> 02:46:50,790
His blood still stains the armor!

3832
02:46:53,690 --> 02:46:56,910
Alright, we gotta get the dumplings so I can cure her!

3833
02:46:58,270 --> 02:46:59,570
What the fuck was that?

3834
02:47:00,950 --> 02:47:01,750
Him?

3835
02:47:02,450 --> 02:47:04,110
Who dares disturb me?

3836
02:47:04,350 --> 02:47:04,850
It's me!

3837
02:47:05,990 --> 02:47:13,830
Your arms are feathered, yet, unlike those monsters, you remain sane enough to engage in conversation.

3838
02:47:13,870 --> 02:47:15,990
It's not identity theft if he's dead.

3839
02:47:16,610 --> 02:47:19,490
Today's sanity may be gone for the most.

3840
02:47:20,250 --> 02:47:23,610
That is like, 100% identity theft!

3841
02:47:23,610 --> 02:47:28,210
In the pasts, I wonder how much you still recall.

3842
02:47:32,830 --> 02:47:33,470
True!

3843
02:47:33,810 --> 02:47:34,890
Just as I thought.

3844
02:47:36,350 --> 02:47:37,710
You can hear them.

3845
02:47:38,170 --> 02:47:40,190
You wanna make the old lady sad?

3846
02:47:40,210 --> 02:47:41,430
I'm just trying to make...

3847
02:47:41,430 --> 02:47:43,550
I'm just trying to give him ho- give her hope.

3848
02:47:44,350 --> 02:47:45,910
Pulling you, Tua.

3849
02:47:49,930 --> 02:47:52,370
This is my inner demon.

3850
02:47:52,670 --> 02:47:56,090
A torment that's lingered far too long.

3851
02:47:57,150 --> 02:47:57,670
Defeated.

3852
02:48:00,410 --> 02:48:02,950
Oh, it will be the end of you.

3853
02:48:06,570 --> 02:48:08,110
Should your sanity...

3854
02:48:08,110 --> 02:48:08,530
Oh, nice!

3855
02:48:08,630 --> 02:48:09,430
I got more mercury.

3856
02:48:10,270 --> 02:48:11,910
I shall send you to the afterlife last.

3857
02:48:11,910 --> 02:48:13,930
First off, we're gonna make sure we're in her will.

3858
02:48:14,270 --> 02:48:14,690
Okay, guys.

3859
02:48:14,890 --> 02:48:16,690
Before we tell her the truth...

3860
02:48:18,350 --> 02:48:19,990
Just gotta make sure...

3861
02:48:20,850 --> 02:48:21,890
We tie all...

3862
02:48:21,890 --> 02:48:23,170
Tie all loose ends.

3863
02:48:25,230 --> 02:48:26,350
And then...

3864
02:48:26,350 --> 02:48:27,750
I'll tell her the truth.

3865
02:48:28,330 --> 02:48:28,650
Okay!

3866
02:48:28,930 --> 02:48:30,330
Her son never visited her.

3867
02:48:31,030 --> 02:48:32,710
I am a good son.

3868
02:48:32,930 --> 02:48:35,990
I literally visited her right after I killed her real son.

3869
02:48:36,750 --> 02:48:38,490
And she was like, Oh my god!

3870
02:48:38,630 --> 02:48:40,430
I haven't seen you in so long!

3871
02:48:40,690 --> 02:48:41,710
And I was like...

3872
02:48:41,710 --> 02:48:41,850
Yep!

3873
02:48:45,010 --> 02:48:45,910
Don't worry!

3874
02:48:46,270 --> 02:48:47,290
But I'm here now.

3875
02:48:51,140 --> 02:48:52,740
What did I get?

3876
02:48:54,100 --> 02:48:55,200
Just like...

3877
02:48:55,200 --> 02:48:56,320
What did I get?

3878
02:49:02,490 --> 02:49:04,050
I did more than...

3879
02:49:04,050 --> 02:49:05,590
Whatever the fuck her old son did.

3880
02:49:06,550 --> 02:49:07,930
Wait, is this a boss fight?

3881
02:49:08,110 --> 02:49:09,410
How did I just walk into...

3882
02:49:09,410 --> 02:49:09,810
Ha ha ha!

3883
02:49:18,490 --> 02:49:19,250
Oh, wait.

3884
02:49:21,350 --> 02:49:22,790
Wait, that's not a woman.

3885
02:49:25,670 --> 02:49:27,850
I was told that...

3886
02:49:28,490 --> 02:49:29,570
It was a lady.

3887
02:49:30,850 --> 02:49:32,830
How can you tell it's a lady?

3888
02:49:33,310 --> 02:49:35,370
How can you tell it's not a lady?

3889
02:49:35,930 --> 02:49:36,490
Ha ha ha!

3890
02:49:36,850 --> 02:49:36,870
Ha

3891
02:49:43,230 --> 02:49:45,530
ha ha!

3892
02:49:46,890 --> 02:49:47,410
I...

3893
02:49:47,410 --> 02:49:47,850
Yes!

3894
02:49:47,910 --> 02:49:48,490
He's the priest!

3895
02:49:48,810 --> 02:49:49,450
I told you!

3896
02:49:49,570 --> 02:49:50,130
I knew it!

3897
02:49:50,590 --> 02:49:51,310
It's the priest!

3898
02:49:58,140 --> 02:49:59,180
What the fuck?

3899
02:49:59,300 --> 02:50:00,140
He's just...

3900
02:50:00,760 --> 02:50:01,280
Like...

3901
02:50:01,280 --> 02:50:02,700
What do you want me to do?

3902
02:50:03,040 --> 02:50:03,300
Ha ha!

3903
02:50:04,160 --> 02:50:05,800
He's just jumping around.

3904
02:50:07,380 --> 02:50:08,340
Oh shit!

3905
02:50:08,500 --> 02:50:08,820
Oh my god!

3906
02:50:08,880 --> 02:50:09,380
Corrupted!

3907
02:50:09,540 --> 02:50:10,540
What does that mean?

3908
02:50:10,940 --> 02:50:12,040
Oh, it's just poison.

3909
02:50:12,400 --> 02:50:12,840
It's fine.

3910
02:50:22,060 --> 02:50:23,360
He's just jumping.

3911
02:50:23,660 --> 02:50:24,680
So it's like...

3912
02:50:24,680 --> 02:50:25,020
Jesus!

3913
02:50:25,260 --> 02:50:25,960
Okay, nevermind.

3914
02:50:28,400 --> 02:50:29,920
What the fuck?!

3915
02:50:36,080 --> 02:50:37,140
Holy shit.

3916
02:50:38,980 --> 02:50:39,900
Oh my god.

3917
02:50:39,900 --> 02:50:41,020
He just fucking...

3918
02:50:41,320 --> 02:50:42,300
Grabbed me like that.

3919
02:50:42,500 --> 02:50:43,460
That should be illegal.

3920
02:50:45,620 --> 02:50:47,060
Get grabbed.

3921
02:50:48,960 --> 02:50:50,980
I wish I could jump.

3922
02:50:51,140 --> 02:50:51,680
I miss...

3923
02:50:52,260 --> 02:50:54,480
I miss jumping.

3924
02:50:55,780 --> 02:50:56,860
You can check from...

3925
02:50:57,020 --> 02:50:58,800
Any additional content from...

3926
02:50:58,980 --> 02:50:59,460
Within.

3927
02:50:59,720 --> 02:50:59,900
Help.

3928
02:51:00,100 --> 02:51:01,460
Under the...

3929
02:51:01,460 --> 02:51:02,460
System...

3930
02:51:02,980 --> 02:51:03,700
Menu.

3931
02:51:04,340 --> 02:51:05,960
What will help me?

3932
02:51:09,100 --> 02:51:10,720
They're like...

3933
02:51:10,720 --> 02:51:12,640
Check the help button.

3934
02:51:13,540 --> 02:51:14,900
You'll need it.

3935
02:51:18,820 --> 02:51:20,160
I'm like...

3936
02:51:23,740 --> 02:51:24,760
They're like...

3937
02:51:24,760 --> 02:51:25,660
Just read it.

3938
02:51:25,980 --> 02:51:26,220
What?

3939
02:51:29,160 --> 02:51:30,240
Oh my god.

3940
02:51:30,460 --> 02:51:31,140
Are you serious?

3941
02:51:35,780 --> 02:51:36,520
Oh my god.

3942
02:51:36,700 --> 02:51:36,840
Okay.

3943
02:51:37,100 --> 02:51:37,260
Nice.

3944
02:51:40,980 --> 02:51:41,520
Good.

3945
02:51:43,260 --> 02:51:43,800
Okay.

3946
02:51:43,840 --> 02:51:44,280
That's good.

3947
02:51:45,260 --> 02:51:45,800
Oh!

3948
02:51:45,920 --> 02:51:46,940
I forgot to use fire.

3949
02:51:49,040 --> 02:51:51,380
I did not expect her to be so fast though.

3950
02:51:59,010 --> 02:51:59,550
Okay.

3951
02:52:00,690 --> 02:52:01,230
Okay.

3952
02:52:05,040 --> 02:52:06,180
Oh, come on.

3953
02:52:09,680 --> 02:52:10,200
Nice.

3954
02:52:13,220 --> 02:52:13,740
Okay.

3955
02:52:17,930 --> 02:52:18,450
Alright.

3956
02:52:20,210 --> 02:52:21,270
Like, I don't know...

3957
02:52:21,270 --> 02:52:21,450
Okay.

3958
02:52:21,490 --> 02:52:22,230
That's how you dodge that.

3959
02:52:22,350 --> 02:52:22,430
Okay.

3960
02:52:22,470 --> 02:52:22,770
Nevermind.

3961
02:52:22,790 --> 02:52:23,010
Dude.

3962
02:52:23,850 --> 02:52:24,350
Are you...

3963
02:52:24,350 --> 02:52:24,770
Are you...

3964
02:52:24,770 --> 02:52:25,090
Are you...

3965
02:52:25,090 --> 02:52:25,790
Oh my god.

3966
02:52:25,790 --> 02:52:27,210
The stupid corruption.

3967
02:52:27,210 --> 02:52:28,450
Oh!

3968
02:52:32,230 --> 02:52:32,870
Oh!

3969
02:52:33,410 --> 02:52:33,810
The stu...

3970
02:52:33,810 --> 02:52:34,090
Yeah.

3971
02:52:34,750 --> 02:52:35,850
The stupid corruption.

3972
02:52:38,510 --> 02:52:39,410
I didn't...

3973
02:52:39,410 --> 02:52:41,050
I've never seen that move before too.

3974
02:52:43,790 --> 02:52:44,430
Alright.

3975
02:52:44,870 --> 02:52:45,510
Let's...

3976
02:52:45,510 --> 02:52:47,710
I'll have to do the fire thing first.

3977
02:52:47,870 --> 02:52:48,850
Before I go in.

3978
02:52:52,850 --> 02:52:53,610
Okay.

3979
02:52:56,070 --> 02:52:58,690
That was for the identity theft.

3980
02:53:02,270 --> 02:53:02,650
Okay.

3981
02:53:02,930 --> 02:53:03,850
Go in first.

3982
02:53:04,150 --> 02:53:04,870
And then...

3983
02:53:09,980 --> 02:53:10,740
Nice.

3984
02:53:13,980 --> 02:53:14,360
Nice.

3985
02:53:15,340 --> 02:53:16,100
Okay.

3986
02:53:16,280 --> 02:53:18,040
Oh, it does so much damage.

3987
02:53:18,300 --> 02:53:19,100
Holy shit.

3988
02:53:19,920 --> 02:53:20,520
Okay.

3989
02:53:20,800 --> 02:53:21,300
Okay.

3990
02:53:21,360 --> 02:53:22,900
He is definitely weak to fire.

3991
02:53:24,840 --> 02:53:26,120
Oh, I hate...

3992
02:53:26,460 --> 02:53:27,020
I hate that.

3993
02:53:27,100 --> 02:53:28,020
I hate that corruption.

3994
02:53:31,460 --> 02:53:32,740
I hate the corruption.

3995
02:53:38,740 --> 02:53:40,140
Oh my god.

3996
02:53:40,660 --> 02:53:42,600
Fucking stupid ass command grab.

3997
02:53:43,280 --> 02:53:44,040
I'm dead.

3998
02:53:44,220 --> 02:53:44,500
I'm dead.

3999
02:53:44,520 --> 02:53:45,360
I'm pretty sure.

4000
02:53:45,520 --> 02:53:46,040
Oh yeah.

4001
02:53:46,040 --> 02:53:46,740
I'm so dead.

4002
02:53:47,080 --> 02:53:48,260
That takes so much...

4003
02:53:48,260 --> 02:53:48,980
Oh my god.

4004
02:53:49,060 --> 02:53:50,140
That takes so much damage.

4005
02:53:50,520 --> 02:53:52,340
That takes so much damage.

4006
02:53:52,960 --> 02:53:54,340
Does I need more vitality?

4007
02:53:57,500 --> 02:53:59,240
That was bad timing.

4008
02:54:01,000 --> 02:54:01,680
If...

4009
02:54:01,680 --> 02:54:02,820
I don't know if it's like...

4010
02:54:02,820 --> 02:54:03,500
What I'm...

4011
02:54:03,500 --> 02:54:04,040
The skill...

4012
02:54:04,040 --> 02:54:05,500
I'm fucking up my skill tree.

4013
02:54:05,860 --> 02:54:06,840
But like...

4014
02:54:06,840 --> 02:54:08,620
They do so much damage.

4015
02:54:09,040 --> 02:54:09,720
For like...

4016
02:54:09,720 --> 02:54:11,000
The amount of...

4017
02:54:11,000 --> 02:54:12,280
HP I have.

4018
02:54:16,770 --> 02:54:17,910
Oh, I'm...

4019
02:54:17,910 --> 02:54:18,570
I'm...

4020
02:54:18,570 --> 02:54:18,910
Mad.

4021
02:54:23,390 --> 02:54:24,630
I'm mad now.

4022
02:54:24,950 --> 02:54:25,230
Okay.

4023
02:54:25,630 --> 02:54:27,510
At least I know I'm mad.

4024
02:54:44,290 --> 02:54:45,510
Okay.

4025
02:54:47,050 --> 02:54:49,930
I need a...

4026
02:54:51,140 --> 02:54:51,750
No!

4027
02:54:52,050 --> 02:54:52,570
Ah!

4028
02:54:53,190 --> 02:54:55,070
I saw it too!

4029
02:54:55,670 --> 02:54:58,190
His command grab is like...

4030
02:54:58,190 --> 02:54:59,030
Sort of...

4031
02:54:59,030 --> 02:54:59,750
Bit...

4032
02:54:59,750 --> 02:55:00,390
Funky.

4033
02:55:04,840 --> 02:55:05,890
Jesus Christ.

4034
02:55:10,890 --> 02:55:12,360
Are you serious?

4035
02:55:15,000 --> 02:55:16,400
I'm gonna use the bathroom.

4036
02:55:16,640 --> 02:55:17,700
I'll be right back.

4037
02:56:44,800 --> 02:56:45,120
Back.

4038
02:56:45,500 --> 02:56:46,120
Oh my gosh.

4039
02:56:46,260 --> 02:56:47,420
Okay, I was panicking a little bit.

4040
02:56:47,480 --> 02:56:48,220
Cause I was like, where's dad?

4041
02:56:48,400 --> 02:56:49,160
And then...

4042
02:56:49,160 --> 02:56:50,040
Cause he was in his bed.

4043
02:56:50,360 --> 02:56:51,320
But I did have like...

4044
02:56:51,320 --> 02:56:52,940
Okay, so he has a lot of different types of...

4045
02:56:52,940 --> 02:56:55,120
He has a lot of dog beds scattered around the apartment.

4046
02:56:55,760 --> 02:56:56,160
Uh...

4047
02:56:56,160 --> 02:56:56,820
Well, he has like...

4048
02:56:56,820 --> 02:56:57,220
Three.

4049
02:56:59,000 --> 02:56:59,840
He has four.

4050
02:57:00,820 --> 02:57:02,060
But the fourth one...

4051
02:57:02,060 --> 02:57:03,440
He doesn't use.

4052
02:57:03,800 --> 02:57:04,500
Because it's...

4053
02:57:04,500 --> 02:57:04,720
I...

4054
02:57:04,720 --> 02:57:05,020
I don't know.

4055
02:57:05,120 --> 02:57:05,520
He doesn't...

4056
02:57:05,520 --> 02:57:06,880
He never uses the fourth one.

4057
02:57:07,220 --> 02:57:07,860
But like...

4058
02:57:07,860 --> 02:57:09,080
It's basically like a little house.

4059
02:57:09,220 --> 02:57:10,520
It's like a little house, basically.

4060
02:57:10,740 --> 02:57:11,700
So it's like a little...

4061
02:57:11,700 --> 02:57:12,760
Cave bed.

4062
02:57:12,940 --> 02:57:14,260
But he never uses it.

4063
02:57:14,320 --> 02:57:15,220
So I was like, where is he?

4064
02:57:15,220 --> 02:57:16,420
And then like...

4065
02:57:16,420 --> 02:57:16,740
I...

4066
02:57:17,180 --> 02:57:18,200
I was like...

4067
02:57:18,200 --> 02:57:18,900
Crouched down.

4068
02:57:19,040 --> 02:57:20,420
And I saw him in the little cave bed.

4069
02:57:21,400 --> 02:57:22,560
And I was like, what the fuck?

4070
02:57:25,280 --> 02:57:26,580
He has a lot of options.

4071
02:57:26,780 --> 02:57:26,920
Yeah.

4072
02:57:27,720 --> 02:57:28,680
I was like, where is he?

4073
02:57:30,900 --> 02:57:32,000
And then I like...

4074
02:57:32,000 --> 02:57:33,480
Crouched down to find him.

4075
02:57:37,860 --> 02:57:40,080
How the fuck did I get like a...

4076
02:57:40,580 --> 02:57:40,980
Like...

4077
02:57:40,980 --> 02:57:41,440
I don't know.

4078
02:57:41,480 --> 02:57:41,860
What was it?

4079
02:57:43,900 --> 02:57:44,300
Like...

4080
02:57:44,920 --> 02:57:45,320
Like...

4081
02:57:45,980 --> 02:57:46,380
Um...

4082
02:57:46,380 --> 02:57:47,040
A stagger?

4083
02:57:47,260 --> 02:57:48,160
Is it like...

4084
02:57:48,160 --> 02:57:49,060
Fucking...

4085
02:57:50,780 --> 02:57:52,600
I don't even know how I got it earlier.

4086
02:57:55,760 --> 02:57:56,280
What?!

4087
02:57:56,280 --> 02:57:57,280
That should not have hit me!

4088
02:57:57,440 --> 02:57:59,120
That should not have hit me!

4089
02:58:01,340 --> 02:58:01,860
Oh...

4090
02:58:02,560 --> 02:58:03,460
Me angy.

4091
02:58:18,250 --> 02:58:19,290
Me angy.

4092
02:58:20,530 --> 02:58:21,210
All right.

4093
02:58:21,390 --> 02:58:21,810
I'm...

4094
02:58:21,810 --> 02:58:22,230
I'm...

4095
02:58:22,230 --> 02:58:22,870
I'm...

4096
02:58:22,870 --> 02:58:23,270
I'm locking in.

4097
02:58:24,150 --> 02:58:25,630
I'm locking in now.

4098
02:58:27,870 --> 02:58:30,550
Your power is increased, but so has the damage...

4099
02:58:30,550 --> 02:58:31,150
Oh, I'm a...

4100
02:58:31,150 --> 02:58:32,330
I'm actually angry.

4101
02:58:32,830 --> 02:58:33,110
I...

4102
02:58:34,930 --> 02:58:37,050
She's angry too now!

4103
02:58:37,370 --> 02:58:40,750
I swear to God, if my inner demon shows up...

4104
02:58:40,750 --> 02:58:41,450
I swear...

4105
02:58:43,330 --> 02:58:44,850
Is it interesting though!

4106
02:58:45,030 --> 02:58:45,410
Like, if...

4107
02:58:45,410 --> 02:58:48,090
The more times you die, the more damage you do!

4108
02:58:53,750 --> 02:58:55,270
Like, that's also...

4109
02:58:55,270 --> 02:58:56,210
Oh my God!

4110
02:58:57,010 --> 02:58:58,290
I don't know, this one...

4111
02:58:58,290 --> 02:58:58,970
This is...

4112
02:58:58,970 --> 02:58:59,650
Oh my God!

4113
02:59:00,510 --> 02:59:01,810
I don't know...

4114
02:59:01,810 --> 02:59:02,130
This one...

4115
02:59:02,130 --> 02:59:03,490
Guess not...

4116
02:59:03,490 --> 02:59:04,650
Is not...

4117
02:59:10,630 --> 02:59:11,230
Like...

4118
02:59:13,270 --> 02:59:15,670
Okay, now I'm locked in.

4119
02:59:15,890 --> 02:59:16,990
Now I'm...

4120
02:59:17,830 --> 02:59:22,430
Okay, he might have just perfected me, but I'm locked in now.

4121
02:59:26,090 --> 02:59:28,230
Bro is doing a no-hit challenge.

4122
02:59:36,680 --> 02:59:38,800
I don't know if I'm under level or not.

4123
02:59:38,860 --> 02:59:39,740
That's an issue too.

4124
02:59:40,020 --> 02:59:40,900
I could be under level.

4125
02:59:41,080 --> 02:59:41,980
I do have...

4126
02:59:49,440 --> 02:59:53,880
I do have like one more of this, but... Wait, can I call?

4127
02:59:54,100 --> 02:59:55,920
Oh my god, I'm so dumb.

4128
03:00:03,090 --> 03:00:04,250
Get over here.

4129
03:00:05,130 --> 03:00:06,510
Get over here.

4130
03:00:06,590 --> 03:00:07,150
It's time.

4131
03:00:09,230 --> 03:00:10,110
It's time.

4132
03:00:10,790 --> 03:00:11,710
That's right.

4133
03:00:12,110 --> 03:00:12,970
Get him.

4134
03:00:14,350 --> 03:00:15,310
That's right.

4135
03:00:19,260 --> 03:00:20,240
It's time.

4136
03:00:21,120 --> 03:00:23,040
I brought it 2v1.

4137
03:00:23,740 --> 03:00:24,700
That's right.

4138
03:00:30,680 --> 03:00:31,280
That's right.

4139
03:00:31,480 --> 03:00:32,360
It's 2v1 time.

4140
03:00:33,100 --> 03:00:34,480
No one said I couldn't do it.

4141
03:00:35,900 --> 03:00:37,300
Oh my god.

4142
03:00:38,100 --> 03:00:38,820
Yeah, I know.

4143
03:00:39,040 --> 03:00:39,660
He's fucking dead.

4144
03:00:49,480 --> 03:00:50,460
That's right.

4145
03:00:50,760 --> 03:00:51,440
2v1.

4146
03:00:56,260 --> 03:00:57,820
That's all I needed.

4147
03:00:58,140 --> 03:01:00,200
I just needed a second guy.

4148
03:01:00,200 --> 03:01:02,840
That's... That's cheating.

4149
03:01:03,760 --> 03:01:04,440
I'm sorry.

4150
03:01:05,620 --> 03:01:06,840
He's okay.

4151
03:01:07,440 --> 03:01:08,620
He's okay.

4152
03:01:09,420 --> 03:01:10,720
There we go.

4153
03:01:11,040 --> 03:01:11,560
That's all.

4154
03:01:11,700 --> 03:01:13,220
Oh yes, the one point.

4155
03:01:13,820 --> 03:01:16,520
I'm gonna work smarter, not harder.

4156
03:01:17,520 --> 03:01:19,340
I got the Echo of Zuu.

4157
03:01:19,800 --> 03:01:20,780
What is that?

4158
03:01:20,860 --> 03:01:21,780
What did I get?

4159
03:01:25,810 --> 03:01:26,410
Wait.

4160
03:01:27,570 --> 03:01:29,470
This is like a magic build.

4161
03:01:33,350 --> 03:01:35,070
Oh, I got magic.

4162
03:01:37,170 --> 03:01:39,430
I feel like, is magic that strong?

4163
03:01:39,670 --> 03:01:40,910
Oh, magic must be really strong.

4164
03:01:42,130 --> 03:01:42,270
Hmm.

4165
03:01:43,110 --> 03:01:43,590
Oh well.

4166
03:01:43,930 --> 03:01:44,230
Oh well.

4167
03:01:45,230 --> 03:01:47,550
I'm holding back the whole time.

4168
03:01:50,930 --> 03:01:54,270
I was like, I know what to do.

4169
03:01:54,530 --> 03:01:55,310
That's it.

4170
03:01:55,390 --> 03:01:56,550
I'm calling my crew.

4171
03:01:58,790 --> 03:02:01,170
I'm calling the crew over.

4172
03:02:02,010 --> 03:02:04,330
Now, now I'm mad.

4173
03:02:13,320 --> 03:02:16,260
Yeah, that boss did not last 10 seconds.

4174
03:02:19,780 --> 03:02:20,620
Okay, wait.

4175
03:02:20,720 --> 03:02:23,540
Who do I talk to now that I beat his ass?

4176
03:02:27,940 --> 03:02:29,420
Not the crew.

4177
03:02:32,560 --> 03:02:33,740
What a shock.

4178
03:02:34,580 --> 03:02:38,020
I didn't expect the old priest to turn into a monster.

4179
03:02:39,560 --> 03:02:41,920
No wonder the soldiers were stationed there.

4180
03:02:43,780 --> 03:02:45,480
Good thing I kept up my training.

4181
03:02:46,260 --> 03:02:48,020
Yeah, good thing I had a meat shield.

4182
03:02:48,280 --> 03:02:49,320
You're not quite skilled yourself.

4183
03:02:49,680 --> 03:02:51,380
Disrespected the one we won.

4184
03:02:53,660 --> 03:02:54,760
Yeah, here you go.

4185
03:02:55,460 --> 03:02:57,200
So it happened to fall into your possession.

4186
03:02:58,140 --> 03:02:59,780
This thing looks peculiar.

4187
03:03:00,760 --> 03:03:02,240
Wait, I had armor with no poison.

4188
03:03:04,780 --> 03:03:05,300
Oops.

4189
03:03:05,300 --> 03:03:05,420
Oops.

4190
03:03:06,000 --> 03:03:09,060
Look, I had to, I had to get into the old woman's will.

4191
03:03:09,200 --> 03:03:09,440
Okay?

4192
03:03:11,940 --> 03:03:13,020
You'll have it.

4193
03:03:13,360 --> 03:03:15,920
I must return to reverend temple to save my mother.

4194
03:03:17,160 --> 03:03:19,840
If you ever need anything, you know where to find me.

4195
03:03:21,620 --> 03:03:22,100
Cool.

4196
03:03:23,660 --> 03:03:27,800
By whatever means necessary, I had to get into the will.

4197
03:03:28,920 --> 03:03:32,740
Oh, I'm, I'm very angry.

4198
03:03:36,800 --> 03:03:40,840
They're like, you can't, you can't do anymore.

4199
03:03:41,180 --> 03:03:42,560
You're too angry.

4200
03:03:52,840 --> 03:03:54,660
All right, let's scream.

4201
03:03:59,590 --> 03:04:02,270
Oh my god, my dreams are red now.

4202
03:04:02,270 --> 03:04:05,570
Oh my god, holy shit.

4203
03:04:08,090 --> 03:04:10,550
Oh, that's not good.

4204
03:04:16,190 --> 03:04:18,730
I'm having very angry dreams.

4205
03:04:18,890 --> 03:04:22,050
I'm letting out my, my anger now too.

4206
03:04:23,330 --> 03:04:25,650
Oh shit, secret tunnel.

4207
03:04:26,810 --> 03:04:28,770
Why is there blood in my secret tunnel?

4208
03:04:29,090 --> 03:04:30,170
Why is there?

4209
03:04:30,410 --> 03:04:32,410
Who fucking died here?

4210
03:04:33,130 --> 03:04:36,230
Oh my god, wait, a lot of people died here.

4211
03:04:37,590 --> 03:04:41,170
Wait, this is a scary secret tunnel.

4212
03:04:43,990 --> 03:04:44,890
How did I?

4213
03:04:45,050 --> 03:04:46,910
Oh my god, it's all poison.

4214
03:04:46,910 --> 03:04:48,330
It's all poison.

4215
03:04:48,750 --> 03:04:49,990
Oops, all poison.

4216
03:04:56,060 --> 03:04:56,800
Wait, what?

4217
03:04:59,200 --> 03:05:02,860
Oh, we have to push in, denying us, and try to develop them to them.

4218
03:05:03,200 --> 03:05:05,160
Reveal his heretical ways for all the seed.

4219
03:05:07,060 --> 03:05:07,940
I don't use spells.

4220
03:05:08,140 --> 03:05:08,690
Oh, it's like...

4221
03:05:10,740 --> 03:05:13,640
Oh, yay, it's a little brighter now.

4222
03:05:16,420 --> 03:05:18,040
Did not grab magic?

4223
03:05:20,720 --> 03:05:22,760
Oh, it's not had magic on me.

4224
03:05:22,940 --> 03:05:23,760
What the fuck?

4225
03:05:25,560 --> 03:05:27,160
What's that one guy in particular?

4226
03:05:30,360 --> 03:05:31,960
Look, there's some monks there.

4227
03:05:40,590 --> 03:05:41,190
Spin!

4228
03:05:42,630 --> 03:05:43,470
That's right.

4229
03:05:43,610 --> 03:05:45,230
I'm already angry anyway.

4230
03:05:49,520 --> 03:05:50,720
No consequences.

4231
03:05:51,220 --> 03:05:53,640
My inner demons is chasing me.

4232
03:06:02,400 --> 03:06:03,260
Who's talking?

4233
03:06:05,340 --> 03:06:06,380
From the shoe sanctum.

4234
03:06:06,480 --> 03:06:07,100
These guys?

4235
03:06:07,120 --> 03:06:08,000
The hood stopped up above.

4236
03:06:08,200 --> 03:06:09,040
The other below.

4237
03:06:09,780 --> 03:06:10,260
A hood.

4238
03:06:10,780 --> 03:06:11,720
The one downstairs.

4239
03:06:12,180 --> 03:06:13,380
It's already dead.

4240
03:06:14,440 --> 03:06:16,120
Wait, are these the guys talking?

4241
03:06:17,260 --> 03:06:20,800
How come the other guy sounds like Gollum, and then...

4242
03:06:22,560 --> 03:06:23,760
Like, wait.

4243
03:06:24,300 --> 03:06:26,320
So like, that's a choice?

4244
03:06:26,900 --> 03:06:30,480
Like, apparently, yes.

4245
03:06:36,460 --> 03:06:37,400
It's fine.

4246
03:06:39,300 --> 03:06:40,640
Because the other guy...

4247
03:06:40,640 --> 03:06:43,280
The fucking other guy merchant sounds like...

4248
03:06:43,280 --> 03:06:47,080
Sounds like Gollum, and these guys are just like regular guys.

4249
03:06:51,950 --> 03:06:55,390
He's the only one that's committed to the bit.

4250
03:07:02,090 --> 03:07:02,850
All right.

4251
03:07:05,030 --> 03:07:06,950
Let's grab this real quick.

4252
03:07:07,250 --> 03:07:08,150
Maybe I can...

4253
03:07:08,150 --> 03:07:08,310
Okay.

4254
03:07:08,670 --> 03:07:08,830
Okay.

4255
03:07:09,010 --> 03:07:09,470
Never mind.

4256
03:07:09,690 --> 03:07:10,170
It doesn't...

4257
03:07:10,170 --> 03:07:10,830
Oh, I like how...

4258
03:07:10,830 --> 03:07:12,350
Oh, corruption is poison.

4259
03:07:12,850 --> 03:07:13,790
I see.

4260
03:07:14,910 --> 03:07:18,550
Maybe I should have more poison resistance today.

4261
03:07:18,850 --> 03:07:19,590
I'm committed to.

4262
03:07:20,460 --> 03:07:21,190
Oh, nice.

4263
03:07:21,550 --> 03:07:22,110
Nice.

4264
03:07:31,730 --> 03:07:32,280
All right.

4265
03:07:32,480 --> 03:07:32,920
Let's go.

4266
03:07:33,620 --> 03:07:34,600
Let's dream.

4267
03:07:35,420 --> 03:07:37,520
Let's go to my mad dream.

4268
03:07:44,680 --> 03:07:45,500
Yeah.

4269
03:07:48,460 --> 03:07:50,380
I'm so angry.

4270
03:07:52,210 --> 03:07:53,300
What the fuck?

4271
03:07:54,870 --> 03:07:55,980
Oh, it's just a...

4272
03:07:55,980 --> 03:07:56,820
It's just a guy.

4273
03:07:58,980 --> 03:08:00,360
It's just him.

4274
03:08:02,480 --> 03:08:03,140
Okay.

4275
03:08:03,520 --> 03:08:05,040
No, there's a mineshaft too?

4276
03:08:05,480 --> 03:08:06,680
Oh my god.

4277
03:08:07,140 --> 03:08:07,800
No.

4278
03:08:10,540 --> 03:08:11,960
No, that's the shortcut.

4279
03:08:12,540 --> 03:08:14,320
I can never escape them.

4280
03:08:14,540 --> 03:08:15,520
Oh my god.

4281
03:08:15,760 --> 03:08:16,620
Are you serious?

4282
03:08:16,780 --> 03:08:17,180
You?

4283
03:08:20,040 --> 03:08:21,280
Jesus Christ.

4284
03:08:22,660 --> 03:08:24,300
And then I get shot.

4285
03:08:24,720 --> 03:08:26,720
In the middle of trying to heal.

4286
03:08:33,730 --> 03:08:34,390
Yeah.

4287
03:08:37,050 --> 03:08:37,770
Oh my god.

4288
03:08:37,890 --> 03:08:37,930
Oh my god.

4289
03:08:37,930 --> 03:08:38,390
Get out.

4290
03:08:38,930 --> 03:08:40,250
No one likes you.

4291
03:08:44,050 --> 03:08:44,530
Oh.

4292
03:08:44,930 --> 03:08:45,410
Ugh.

4293
03:08:49,150 --> 03:08:50,850
Oh, that does not do a lot.

4294
03:08:52,830 --> 03:08:54,070
Why are you backing away?

4295
03:08:54,610 --> 03:08:55,290
Oh my god.

4296
03:08:55,390 --> 03:08:55,750
That's poison.

4297
03:08:56,050 --> 03:08:56,750
Oh, fuck.

4298
03:08:57,070 --> 03:08:57,650
Oh my god.

4299
03:08:57,750 --> 03:08:58,190
And it's complete.

4300
03:08:58,650 --> 03:08:59,630
And it's complete.

4301
03:08:59,830 --> 03:09:01,010
I can never escape it.

4302
03:09:01,010 --> 03:09:02,390
We won't escape.

4303
03:09:02,390 --> 03:09:03,510
There's double poison?

4304
03:09:04,370 --> 03:09:06,410
Oh, and it...

4305
03:09:07,630 --> 03:09:08,330
Oh.

4306
03:09:13,070 --> 03:09:13,710
Oh.

4307
03:09:14,910 --> 03:09:16,070
Oh.

4308
03:09:16,790 --> 03:09:16,970
Oh.

4309
03:09:16,970 --> 03:09:17,550
Oh.

4310
03:09:21,210 --> 03:09:22,610
Oh.

4311
03:09:23,570 --> 03:09:23,930
Okay.

4312
03:09:25,870 --> 03:09:28,390
That's stronger poison.

4313
03:09:31,820 --> 03:09:33,220
Oh.

4314
03:09:33,580 --> 03:09:33,900
Oh.

4315
03:09:37,400 --> 03:09:39,880
Oh my god, there's the feathered men.

4316
03:09:44,700 --> 03:09:46,220
Oh wait, they're both feathered.

4317
03:09:46,740 --> 03:09:48,940
Oh, that means killing them won't be a crime!

4318
03:09:53,960 --> 03:09:54,540
Okay.

4319
03:09:55,520 --> 03:09:56,100
Nice.

4320
03:09:58,700 --> 03:10:01,240
Okay, am I... No, I'm still fucking mad.

4321
03:10:05,110 --> 03:10:07,010
Gotta make sure I don't touch the poison.

4322
03:10:09,570 --> 03:10:10,150
Oh!

4323
03:10:10,430 --> 03:10:12,010
What the fuck?!

4324
03:10:13,230 --> 03:10:14,770
Thank god, he missed!

4325
03:10:20,260 --> 03:10:25,180
Oh my god, when I don't have messages to tell me about ambushes, it's a whole new experience.

4326
03:10:29,600 --> 03:10:31,340
Oh, thank god.

4327
03:10:33,280 --> 03:10:41,660
This actually is a whole different experience when I don't have, like, the messages to tell me about the ambushes.

4328
03:10:46,990 --> 03:10:48,190
Alright, up I go.

4329
03:10:48,370 --> 03:10:50,070
Jesus Christ, that's a long ladder.

4330
03:10:51,010 --> 03:10:52,270
Up, up, up!

4331
03:10:52,670 --> 03:10:54,230
Up, up, up!

4332
03:10:56,910 --> 03:10:57,470
Weeeeeeeeee!

4333
03:11:06,740 --> 03:11:07,300
Oh.

4334
03:11:09,620 --> 03:11:13,120
Okay, to be fair, that rock then did really well.

4335
03:11:16,400 --> 03:11:18,040
I swear... Oh my god, it's him.

4336
03:11:18,200 --> 03:11:18,820
It's a gunman.

4337
03:11:23,300 --> 03:11:23,840
Alright.

4338
03:11:24,860 --> 03:11:25,320
Okay.

4339
03:11:25,640 --> 03:11:27,760
I wanna use one of the other spells.

4340
03:11:30,780 --> 03:11:33,000
I'm not running right now because I'm scared.

4341
03:11:33,360 --> 03:11:33,840
Oh, yeah.

4342
03:11:34,400 --> 03:11:35,740
Okay, that's good that I did run.

4343
03:11:39,700 --> 03:11:43,060
I was like, I'm scared about what flies ahead.

4344
03:11:45,480 --> 03:11:46,720
Wait, what's this?

4345
03:11:47,260 --> 03:11:47,580
Wait.

4346
03:11:47,760 --> 03:11:48,080
Oh!

4347
03:11:48,460 --> 03:11:48,520
Oh!

4348
03:11:49,000 --> 03:11:49,380
Guys.

4349
03:11:50,860 --> 03:11:51,180
Goodbye.

4350
03:11:51,620 --> 03:11:52,460
Wait, what?

4351
03:11:52,940 --> 03:11:53,300
Wait.

4352
03:11:54,240 --> 03:11:54,880
What?

4353
03:11:55,920 --> 03:11:57,520
Oh my god, I guess.

4354
03:11:57,700 --> 03:11:58,080
Never mind.

4355
03:11:58,220 --> 03:11:58,720
No goodbye.

4356
03:12:05,430 --> 03:12:06,450
How?

4357
03:12:09,190 --> 03:12:10,210
How?

4358
03:12:10,210 --> 03:12:11,410
How did it escape?

4359
03:12:11,630 --> 03:12:12,790
How did it escape?

4360
03:12:12,790 --> 03:12:13,830
I'm sweating it.

4361
03:12:15,990 --> 03:12:17,610
Yes, goodbye.

4362
03:12:19,890 --> 03:12:21,070
I... Oh my god.

4363
03:12:21,090 --> 03:12:23,170
What the fuck am I looking at?

4364
03:12:27,270 --> 03:12:27,950
Holy... shit.

4365
03:12:28,150 --> 03:12:29,130
That's a core weapon.

4366
03:12:29,390 --> 03:12:30,530
Oh my god!

4367
03:12:30,670 --> 03:12:31,930
No, no, no, no...

4368
03:12:31,930 --> 03:12:35,330
No, not ultra poison!

4369
03:12:37,330 --> 03:12:39,670
I refuse to get ultra poison!

4370
03:12:41,030 --> 03:12:42,330
Oh my god.

4371
03:12:44,670 --> 03:12:46,430
Do I have to go that way?

4372
03:12:47,230 --> 03:12:48,510
Is there another way I can go?

4373
03:12:57,520 --> 03:13:00,660
I'm wondering if I had to... Okay, drop down from here.

4374
03:13:03,500 --> 03:13:06,620
I broke my fucking chins, I guess.

4375
03:13:07,520 --> 03:13:08,160
I...

4376
03:13:09,980 --> 03:13:11,060
Alright, cool.

4377
03:13:15,000 --> 03:13:15,640
What?!

4378
03:13:18,820 --> 03:13:22,580
Okay, that's like such a short... that's such a short time.

4379
03:13:31,380 --> 03:13:35,300
This is the message telling you about the next ambush.

4380
03:13:36,160 --> 03:13:38,980
Next, thank you for the super chat.

4381
03:13:39,200 --> 03:13:40,420
Thank you, thank you.

4382
03:13:41,920 --> 03:13:46,180
Like, it felt like I could go through it, but I guess my dumpy was too thick.

4383
03:13:46,500 --> 03:13:49,380
I guess my dumpy was just a little too thick.

4384
03:13:49,840 --> 03:13:50,440
Oh well.

4385
03:13:52,020 --> 03:13:53,580
Oh fucking well.

4386
03:13:56,360 --> 03:13:58,480
Is it here that dropped me down?

4387
03:13:58,800 --> 03:14:00,400
Yeah, it was.

4388
03:14:01,080 --> 03:14:02,960
Okay, I'm gonna see if I can get out of here.

4389
03:14:03,420 --> 03:14:04,860
Yeah, I'm just gonna run past everything.

4390
03:14:05,100 --> 03:14:05,820
Like, fuck this.

4391
03:14:06,820 --> 03:14:08,520
Oh my god, off of your head.

4392
03:14:12,280 --> 03:14:14,000
I'm just gonna run past everything.

4393
03:14:18,880 --> 03:14:19,740
Okay, nice.

4394
03:14:20,000 --> 03:14:20,820
Invincibility frames.

4395
03:14:21,040 --> 03:14:21,580
That's good.

4396
03:14:25,870 --> 03:14:27,330
Just slowly climb up.

4397
03:14:27,530 --> 03:14:30,170
It's okay, they don't have hands to climb up ladders.

4398
03:14:37,810 --> 03:14:41,070
At the moment, I don't really know how I feel about this game.

4399
03:14:41,990 --> 03:14:43,570
I think, like, my only, um...

4400
03:14:44,670 --> 03:14:46,230
The one thing I don't really...

4401
03:14:46,230 --> 03:14:49,290
That I don't like is just the slow heals.

4402
03:14:49,810 --> 03:14:51,630
The slow heals and...

4403
03:14:51,630 --> 03:14:53,630
Okay, I'm gonna fucking chop this fucking...

4404
03:14:53,630 --> 03:14:54,250
That's right.

4405
03:14:54,410 --> 03:14:55,850
Oh my god, he has a little dumpy too.

4406
03:14:56,310 --> 03:14:57,390
What does the ban...

4407
03:14:57,390 --> 03:14:58,810
Oh, Bamboo Shooters for upgrading.

4408
03:15:01,650 --> 03:15:03,270
Like, I have to drop here though.

4409
03:15:04,690 --> 03:15:06,030
Heals are very slow.

4410
03:15:06,890 --> 03:15:08,050
Oh my god, my inner demon!

4411
03:15:08,190 --> 03:15:08,950
My inner demon!

4412
03:15:13,090 --> 03:15:14,090
Oh my god.

4413
03:15:15,070 --> 03:15:16,150
She's so mad.

4414
03:15:16,610 --> 03:15:17,290
She's so mad.

4415
03:15:17,510 --> 03:15:19,470
Oh my god, my inner demon's here.

4416
03:15:20,610 --> 03:15:21,950
Maybe she'll get tired.

4417
03:15:22,630 --> 03:15:24,510
Guys, do you think my inner demon will get tired?

4418
03:15:29,170 --> 03:15:32,150
Defeat my inner demon, Toki.

4419
03:15:34,510 --> 03:15:36,530
Holy shit, she's so...

4420
03:15:37,050 --> 03:15:38,750
Why is she so strong?

4421
03:15:39,230 --> 03:15:40,450
Compared to me!

4422
03:15:42,230 --> 03:15:43,310
Okay, it's fine.

4423
03:15:43,990 --> 03:15:45,010
Okay, I stun-locked her.

4424
03:15:45,130 --> 03:15:45,550
Let's go.

4425
03:15:46,250 --> 03:15:49,650
I actually stun-locked her into the fucking corner.

4426
03:15:49,850 --> 03:15:50,190
Let's go.

4427
03:15:50,350 --> 03:15:51,510
We're playing fighting games now.

4428
03:15:52,930 --> 03:15:54,370
But she's so tanky.

4429
03:15:56,910 --> 03:15:59,030
She was so fucking tanky.

4430
03:15:59,230 --> 03:16:01,510
At least, like, she brought my...

4431
03:16:02,150 --> 03:16:04,330
My mercury closer to me.

4432
03:16:04,510 --> 03:16:05,030
That's nice.

4433
03:16:08,030 --> 03:16:10,170
My inner demon defeated.

4434
03:16:14,360 --> 03:16:15,740
Are you serious?

4435
03:16:15,960 --> 03:16:16,780
Like, you whore!

4436
03:16:18,640 --> 03:16:20,480
I'm fucking kicking a ladder!

4437
03:16:20,640 --> 03:16:21,140
I get shot!

4438
03:16:22,560 --> 03:16:24,620
Like, what's wrong with you?

4439
03:16:30,120 --> 03:16:31,480
Wait, I'm back here.

4440
03:16:31,820 --> 03:16:32,860
I'm back at the shortcut.

4441
03:16:34,300 --> 03:16:36,300
Where the fuck am I supposed to go?

4442
03:16:41,470 --> 03:16:42,630
It doesn't work yet.

4443
03:16:44,430 --> 03:16:45,150
What?

4444
03:16:48,440 --> 03:16:49,800
Yeah, it's a shortcut.

4445
03:16:50,040 --> 03:16:51,640
So, is there another pathway up here?

4446
03:16:56,440 --> 03:16:57,820
There's nothing here.

4447
03:17:00,240 --> 03:17:02,220
Oh my god, I hate...

4448
03:17:04,080 --> 03:17:05,520
Oh, the...

4449
03:17:06,460 --> 03:17:07,900
Those guys...

4450
03:17:07,900 --> 03:17:08,440
I...

4451
03:17:08,440 --> 03:17:08,840
I...

4452
03:17:08,840 --> 03:17:08,980
I...

4453
03:17:08,980 --> 03:17:10,420
I...

4454
03:17:10,420 --> 03:17:12,320
Calm down.

4455
03:17:12,740 --> 03:17:13,720
Calm down.

4456
03:17:14,360 --> 03:17:15,200
Ooh...

4457
03:17:16,240 --> 03:17:17,080
Ooh...

4458
03:17:17,080 --> 03:17:18,680
Yes, that was bullshit.

4459
03:17:19,240 --> 03:17:21,700
That was very extremely bullshit.

4460
03:17:23,200 --> 03:17:23,760
No.

4461
03:17:24,260 --> 03:17:25,180
Because there's nothing...

4462
03:17:25,180 --> 03:17:26,400
Nowhere to go from there.

4463
03:17:31,060 --> 03:17:32,320
Is there...?

4464
03:17:34,640 --> 03:17:36,600
Feels like there's nothing there.

4465
03:17:43,430 --> 03:17:44,510
Okay, that's good.

4466
03:17:44,630 --> 03:17:44,850
That...

4467
03:17:44,850 --> 03:17:45,850
That's so much damage.

4468
03:17:52,090 --> 03:17:54,530
I hate them so much.

4469
03:17:55,430 --> 03:17:57,210
I hate these...

4470
03:17:57,210 --> 03:17:59,470
I hate these guys so much.

4471
03:17:59,670 --> 03:18:01,430
And they can also grab...

4472
03:18:01,430 --> 03:18:01,770
Crap.

4473
03:18:09,380 --> 03:18:11,430
They were so hungry.

4474
03:18:12,790 --> 03:18:15,010
Yeah, the...

4475
03:18:15,010 --> 03:18:15,470
Hmm?

4476
03:18:16,010 --> 03:18:19,020
I'm so confused on like...

4477
03:18:20,310 --> 03:18:20,880
Hmm...

4478
03:18:21,450 --> 03:18:23,590
I'm very confused.

4479
03:18:28,400 --> 03:18:29,820
Cause it's like...

4480
03:18:29,820 --> 03:18:30,600
I went everywhere.

4481
03:18:30,800 --> 03:18:31,220
Did I not?

4482
03:18:32,860 --> 03:18:34,160
Did I not go everywhere?

4483
03:18:38,060 --> 03:18:40,780
Cause I don't think I have to fight that.

4484
03:18:41,100 --> 03:18:41,880
That's the thing.

4485
03:18:42,700 --> 03:18:45,420
I'm pretty sure I don't have to fight that.

4486
03:18:46,080 --> 03:18:47,740
I mean, I could cheese it like this.

4487
03:18:49,260 --> 03:18:50,920
I could literally cheese it with magic.

4488
03:18:56,850 --> 03:18:58,390
Yeah, this is like...

4489
03:18:58,390 --> 03:18:58,790
Oh my god.

4490
03:18:58,850 --> 03:19:00,330
They literally give me blight too.

4491
03:19:05,880 --> 03:19:06,220
I'm...

4492
03:19:06,220 --> 03:19:06,880
I'm trying.

4493
03:19:07,120 --> 03:19:08,240
Do I have to chop these?

4494
03:19:10,020 --> 03:19:10,360
No.

4495
03:19:11,800 --> 03:19:12,480
Okay.

4496
03:19:17,140 --> 03:19:19,400
No, I will never swap off my armor.

4497
03:19:20,020 --> 03:19:20,700
I...

4498
03:19:20,700 --> 03:19:21,740
I am her son.

4499
03:19:23,360 --> 03:19:24,920
Okay, I'm gonna cheese this.

4500
03:19:27,280 --> 03:19:29,080
Oh shit, you fucker.

4501
03:19:32,560 --> 03:19:33,640
Okay, nice.

4502
03:19:34,700 --> 03:19:35,600
Wait, what?

4503
03:19:36,740 --> 03:19:38,000
Oh, they're feathered too.

4504
03:19:38,640 --> 03:19:38,900
Nice.

4505
03:19:40,440 --> 03:19:42,520
OMG, thank you for the super chat.

4506
03:19:42,600 --> 03:19:43,260
Thank you, thank you.

4507
03:19:43,440 --> 03:19:43,780
Oh!

4508
03:19:45,940 --> 03:19:46,300
Reading.

4509
03:19:49,420 --> 03:19:51,440
It's my dorkable cameoshi, technically.

4510
03:19:51,660 --> 03:19:52,840
But you make my day every day, Doki.

4511
03:19:53,160 --> 03:19:54,400
Love your dork keeping you.

4512
03:19:54,500 --> 03:19:55,160
We love you a bit.

4513
03:19:55,260 --> 03:19:57,020
You have no idea how much you mean to me personally.

4514
03:19:57,360 --> 03:19:58,840
Thank you again for the super chat.

4515
03:19:58,920 --> 03:19:59,700
Thank you, thank you.

4516
03:19:59,860 --> 03:20:01,140
I really appreciate it.

4517
03:20:01,930 --> 03:20:03,580
Oh, you have a great rest of your day.

4518
03:20:04,980 --> 03:20:07,640
Anyone, you've been enjoying the stream.

4519
03:20:08,260 --> 03:20:09,960
Okay, wait, I can infinitely farm this.

4520
03:20:10,300 --> 03:20:10,820
No, wait.

4521
03:20:11,500 --> 03:20:12,180
There you go.

4522
03:20:12,240 --> 03:20:12,560
No!

4523
03:20:12,560 --> 03:20:12,780
No!

4524
03:20:23,390 --> 03:20:24,870
You know what I'm calling it.

4525
03:20:25,330 --> 03:20:25,930
I...

4526
03:20:25,930 --> 03:20:26,230
I...

4527
03:20:30,410 --> 03:20:31,010
I...

4528
03:20:31,010 --> 03:20:32,970
That's the end of today's stream.

4529
03:20:33,630 --> 03:20:34,130
That's...

4530
03:20:35,090 --> 03:20:37,070
That's the end of today's stream.

4531
03:20:39,250 --> 03:20:41,250
I'm calling it here.

4532
03:20:41,870 --> 03:20:42,810
I mean...

4533
03:20:50,650 --> 03:20:52,970
Put a lot longer than I expected to.

4534
03:20:53,790 --> 03:20:54,190
Um...

4535
03:20:54,190 --> 03:20:54,850
Honest opinion.

4536
03:20:55,710 --> 03:20:56,510
Um...

4537
03:20:56,510 --> 03:20:58,110
It is...

4538
03:20:58,110 --> 03:20:59,530
A lot slower...

4539
03:21:00,070 --> 03:21:00,630
Than...

4540
03:21:01,830 --> 03:21:03,510
Than what I'm used to.

4541
03:21:04,930 --> 03:21:05,450
Uh...

4542
03:21:05,450 --> 03:21:06,390
It is...

4543
03:21:06,390 --> 03:21:07,810
A lot slower than what I'm used to.

4544
03:21:07,890 --> 03:21:08,950
When it comes to that...

4545
03:21:08,950 --> 03:21:09,410
I guess like...

4546
03:21:09,410 --> 03:21:10,790
Cause I've been playing Alden Ring for like...

4547
03:21:10,790 --> 03:21:11,470
How many weeks now?

4548
03:21:13,070 --> 03:21:13,590
Um...

4549
03:21:14,890 --> 03:21:15,410
And...

4550
03:21:16,710 --> 03:21:17,230
Uh...

4551
03:21:17,230 --> 03:21:18,190
Mmm...

4552
03:21:18,190 --> 03:21:19,370
The bosses...

4553
03:21:19,370 --> 03:21:20,510
Definitely feel...

4554
03:21:23,170 --> 03:21:24,210
The bosses...

4555
03:21:25,290 --> 03:21:25,810
Uh...

4556
03:21:27,230 --> 03:21:27,750
Feel...

4557
03:21:28,470 --> 03:21:29,130
How do I say?

4558
03:21:29,950 --> 03:21:31,530
It's a little hard to telegraph...

4559
03:21:33,410 --> 03:21:34,450
Their moves...

4560
03:21:34,450 --> 03:21:34,690
For now.

4561
03:21:35,070 --> 03:21:36,170
But I think it's cause like...

4562
03:21:36,170 --> 03:21:37,370
I'm not used to their...

4563
03:21:37,370 --> 03:21:38,610
Combat style.

4564
03:21:38,950 --> 03:21:40,830
I think if I get more used to...

4565
03:21:40,830 --> 03:21:42,570
Their combat style...

4566
03:21:42,570 --> 03:21:43,730
Then it'll be easier to read.

4567
03:21:44,210 --> 03:21:45,350
But they are...

4568
03:21:45,350 --> 03:21:46,610
They are...

4569
03:21:46,610 --> 03:21:47,710
I would say...

4570
03:21:49,570 --> 03:21:51,610
The moment the boss fights...

4571
03:21:52,730 --> 03:21:53,250
Uh...

4572
03:21:53,250 --> 03:21:54,930
Like the moment you realize like...

4573
03:21:54,930 --> 03:21:55,210
You know...

4574
03:21:55,210 --> 03:21:56,250
The moment it clicks...

4575
03:21:56,250 --> 03:21:57,110
It gets easier.

4576
03:21:57,510 --> 03:21:59,350
Because when I was fighting the guy...

4577
03:21:59,350 --> 03:21:59,630
You know...

4578
03:21:59,630 --> 03:22:00,910
When I was fighting this...

4579
03:22:00,910 --> 03:22:01,130
The...

4580
03:22:01,130 --> 03:22:03,510
The mom's son...

4581
03:22:03,510 --> 03:22:04,270
Um...

4582
03:22:04,270 --> 03:22:05,530
It like clicked.

4583
03:22:05,770 --> 03:22:07,530
And then I realized how to...

4584
03:22:07,530 --> 03:22:08,530
Do the fights.

4585
03:22:08,950 --> 03:22:10,990
Yeah, they move in very unique ways.

4586
03:22:11,370 --> 03:22:11,710
Uh...

4587
03:22:11,710 --> 03:22:12,950
The movement style for it.

4588
03:22:14,710 --> 03:22:15,270
Um...

4589
03:22:15,270 --> 03:22:17,110
Yeah, it is very overwhelming.

4590
03:22:17,110 --> 03:22:18,290
There's so many like...

4591
03:22:19,330 --> 03:22:19,890
Items...

4592
03:22:20,670 --> 03:22:21,230
Mechanics...

4593
03:22:22,210 --> 03:22:22,770
Weapons...

4594
03:22:22,770 --> 03:22:24,110
Skill tree...

4595
03:22:25,170 --> 03:22:25,730
And...

4596
03:22:25,730 --> 03:22:26,390
Every...

4597
03:22:26,390 --> 03:22:27,250
There's a lot.

4598
03:22:27,410 --> 03:22:28,670
There's a lot of like...

4599
03:22:28,670 --> 03:22:30,810
Stuff you need to do for the skill tree and everything.

4600
03:22:30,970 --> 03:22:33,190
And I'm pretty sure I'm doing the skill tree wrong.

4601
03:22:33,610 --> 03:22:34,030
I...

4602
03:22:36,430 --> 03:22:36,990
I...

4603
03:22:36,990 --> 03:22:37,970
Yeah...

4604
03:22:37,970 --> 03:22:39,370
I'm pretty sure...

4605
03:22:39,370 --> 03:22:41,270
I'm doing the skill tree wrong.

4606
03:22:41,710 --> 03:22:42,230
So...

4607
03:22:42,230 --> 03:22:44,110
I think that's why I was like...

4608
03:22:44,110 --> 03:22:45,470
Struggling a little bit.

4609
03:22:46,030 --> 03:22:46,590
Um...

4610
03:22:46,590 --> 03:22:49,330
There is a lot of information coming in.

4611
03:22:49,590 --> 03:22:51,530
So I was super overwhelmed at first.

4612
03:22:52,490 --> 03:22:53,050
Uh...

4613
03:22:53,050 --> 03:22:53,990
Yeah, I was like...

4614
03:22:53,990 --> 03:22:55,150
Rotter-dogging the skill tree.

4615
03:22:55,330 --> 03:22:56,030
I was just like...

4616
03:22:56,030 --> 03:22:56,650
I read like...

4617
03:22:57,010 --> 03:22:57,250
The...

4618
03:22:57,250 --> 03:22:57,770
The...

4619
03:22:58,290 --> 03:22:59,810
The hard one was the madness.

4620
03:23:00,030 --> 03:23:02,730
I think the madness was the hardest thing to keep up with.

4621
03:23:02,970 --> 03:23:04,650
Because it's like...

4622
03:23:04,650 --> 03:23:05,290
I like...

4623
03:23:05,290 --> 03:23:05,510
I...

4624
03:23:05,510 --> 03:23:06,310
I don't understand.

4625
03:23:06,630 --> 03:23:07,110
Because like...

4626
03:23:07,110 --> 03:23:08,950
The skill tree also...

4627
03:23:09,370 --> 03:23:13,230
The skill tree also correlates with madness stuff as well.

4628
03:23:13,630 --> 03:23:14,910
And so like...

4629
03:23:14,910 --> 03:23:16,070
Because in the skill tree...

4630
03:23:16,070 --> 03:23:17,090
You guys weren't able to read it.

4631
03:23:17,310 --> 03:23:17,890
But like...

4632
03:23:17,890 --> 03:23:18,290
It's like...

4633
03:23:18,290 --> 03:23:18,890
Oh, if you're...

4634
03:23:18,890 --> 03:23:21,010
If you're above the madness level...

4635
03:23:21,010 --> 03:23:24,090
You do more damage if you unlock this and stuff like that.

4636
03:23:24,410 --> 03:23:24,910
So like...

4637
03:23:26,470 --> 03:23:29,110
Yeah, it's definitely very overwhelming.

4638
03:23:29,490 --> 03:23:30,750
So then you can be like...

4639
03:23:30,750 --> 03:23:31,750
I guess you can like...

4640
03:23:31,750 --> 03:23:34,470
Force yourself to keep dying over and over again.

4641
03:23:34,670 --> 03:23:35,730
To have more damage.

4642
03:23:37,790 --> 03:23:38,170
Um...

4643
03:23:38,170 --> 03:23:39,370
To have more damage.

4644
03:23:39,710 --> 03:23:39,910
To have more damage.

4645
03:23:39,910 --> 03:23:40,730
Just so you can...

4646
03:23:40,730 --> 03:23:41,830
Go in with more...

4647
03:23:41,830 --> 03:23:42,070
Like...

4648
03:23:42,070 --> 03:23:43,250
So you can go in with more madness.

4649
03:23:43,310 --> 03:23:45,630
So you can have more damage when you're fighting certain enemies.

4650
03:23:45,930 --> 03:23:46,390
So like...

4651
03:23:46,390 --> 03:23:47,370
I can see like...

4652
03:23:47,370 --> 03:23:48,590
Those types of strats...

4653
03:23:48,590 --> 03:23:49,410
Coming in.

4654
03:23:49,810 --> 03:23:52,070
But it definitely is a game where you guys have to try it yourself.

4655
03:23:52,270 --> 03:23:52,730
For sure.

4656
03:23:52,890 --> 03:23:53,610
Because for me...

4657
03:23:53,610 --> 03:23:53,850
I...

4658
03:23:53,850 --> 03:23:54,590
I don't know.

4659
03:23:54,630 --> 03:23:55,270
I don't know about...

4660
03:23:55,270 --> 03:23:57,930
Do a part 2 right away.

4661
03:23:58,510 --> 03:24:00,650
Maybe later on down...

4662
03:24:00,650 --> 03:24:01,050
Later...

4663
03:24:01,050 --> 03:24:01,510
Later on.

4664
03:24:01,730 --> 03:24:02,410
Because right now...

4665
03:24:02,410 --> 03:24:03,370
I do want to finish...

4666
03:24:03,370 --> 03:24:04,410
I do want to like...

4667
03:24:04,410 --> 03:24:05,590
Complete the...

4668
03:24:05,590 --> 03:24:06,790
Elder Ring goal.

4669
03:24:06,970 --> 03:24:08,470
The charity goal for Elder Ring first.

4670
03:24:08,650 --> 03:24:10,450
Before we go back to...

4671
03:24:10,450 --> 03:24:11,270
Uh...

4672
03:24:11,270 --> 03:24:11,990
Fallen...

4673
03:24:11,990 --> 03:24:12,810
Fallen Feathers.

4674
03:24:13,830 --> 03:24:14,330
Um...

4675
03:24:14,330 --> 03:24:15,390
And then maybe by then...

4676
03:24:15,390 --> 03:24:15,970
Like...

4677
03:24:15,970 --> 03:24:18,190
People will develop the meta for this game.

4678
03:24:18,430 --> 03:24:19,210
Because like...

4679
03:24:19,210 --> 03:24:19,430
I...

4680
03:24:19,430 --> 03:24:21,490
I sort of don't know what I'm doing right now.

4681
03:24:21,750 --> 03:24:23,170
Ha ha ha ha ha!

4682
03:24:24,070 --> 03:24:24,590
I...

4683
03:24:24,590 --> 03:24:25,950
I def...

4684
03:24:25,950 --> 03:24:26,050
I def...

4685
03:24:26,050 --> 03:24:26,310
Okay, no.

4686
03:24:26,390 --> 03:24:26,710
Not sorry.

4687
03:24:26,830 --> 03:24:29,190
I definitely don't know what I'm doing right now.

4688
03:24:29,470 --> 03:24:30,690
Ha ha ha ha!

4689
03:24:30,930 --> 03:24:31,670
Ha ha ha ha!

4690
03:24:32,170 --> 03:24:32,350
Ha ha ha ha!

4691
03:24:32,370 --> 03:24:32,670
Yeah.

4692
03:24:33,050 --> 03:24:33,370
Yeah.

4693
03:24:33,870 --> 03:24:34,190
I...

4694
03:24:34,190 --> 03:24:35,230
I'm just like...

4695
03:24:35,230 --> 03:24:36,970
Definitely a lot more confused.

4696
03:24:38,790 --> 03:24:39,310
Uh...

4697
03:24:39,310 --> 03:24:40,850
Cause I feel like I'm...

4698
03:24:40,850 --> 03:24:43,270
I just feel like I'm upgrading my skill tree wrong.

4699
03:24:43,850 --> 03:24:45,590
I am winning my fights.

4700
03:24:45,810 --> 03:24:46,470
But like...

4701
03:24:46,470 --> 03:24:46,650
I...

4702
03:24:46,650 --> 03:24:47,070
I don't know.

4703
03:24:47,170 --> 03:24:47,790
I feel like...

4704
03:24:47,790 --> 03:24:51,030
I'm not understanding the skill tree as much as I should be.

4705
03:24:51,210 --> 03:24:52,390
Or the madness shit.

4706
03:24:52,390 --> 03:24:53,770
Ha ha ha ha!

4707
03:24:54,150 --> 03:24:54,930
Ha ha ha ha!

4708
03:24:56,030 --> 03:24:56,730
Ha ha ha!

4709
03:24:57,070 --> 03:24:57,550
Um...

4710
03:24:57,550 --> 03:24:58,470
Uh...

4711
03:24:58,470 --> 03:25:00,590
I might continue it in the future.

4712
03:25:01,010 --> 03:25:02,430
I might continue it.

4713
03:25:02,910 --> 03:25:03,390
Um...

4714
03:25:03,390 --> 03:25:05,970
I do want to finish Elden Ring first before I...

4715
03:25:05,970 --> 03:25:07,390
Do a part two of this.

4716
03:25:08,030 --> 03:25:08,510
Uh...

4717
03:25:08,510 --> 03:25:08,950
But yeah.

4718
03:25:09,170 --> 03:25:10,110
I honestly...

4719
03:25:10,110 --> 03:25:11,730
Encourage you guys to check it out yourself.

4720
03:25:11,870 --> 03:25:13,130
It was interesting for you guys.

4721
03:25:13,930 --> 03:25:14,410
Uh...

4722
03:25:14,410 --> 03:25:15,610
Not sponsored by the way.

4723
03:25:15,670 --> 03:25:16,790
They just gave me a free key.

4724
03:25:17,130 --> 03:25:18,030
Ha ha ha ha!

4725
03:25:18,030 --> 03:25:20,470
But if you enjoyed Souls-like...

4726
03:25:20,470 --> 03:25:22,390
If you really enjoyed Souls-like...

4727
03:25:22,390 --> 03:25:23,310
You might enjoy this.

4728
03:25:23,490 --> 03:25:24,350
It is slower though.

4729
03:25:24,510 --> 03:25:26,260
It is slower than Elden Ring...

4730
03:25:26,690 --> 03:25:27,690
And Bloodborne.

4731
03:25:28,410 --> 03:25:28,830
Um...

4732
03:25:28,830 --> 03:25:30,490
But apparently it's like Dark Souls 1.

4733
03:25:30,610 --> 03:25:32,650
So if you like Dark Souls 1, then you might like this.

4734
03:25:33,570 --> 03:25:34,070
Uh...

4735
03:25:34,070 --> 03:25:34,410
Yeah!

4736
03:25:34,910 --> 03:25:35,410
Um...

4737
03:25:35,410 --> 03:25:36,350
I'm gonna call it here.

4738
03:25:36,510 --> 03:25:37,590
I just have a lot of work to do.

4739
03:25:37,810 --> 03:25:38,810
So I'm just gonna call it here.

4740
03:25:39,510 --> 03:25:39,910
Um...

4741
03:25:39,910 --> 03:25:41,170
But I hope you guys...

4742
03:25:41,170 --> 03:25:42,350
Had a great time watching.

4743
03:25:43,110 --> 03:25:43,510
Um...

4744
03:25:43,510 --> 03:25:44,190
Like I said...

4745
03:25:44,190 --> 03:25:45,170
Please support...

4746
03:25:45,170 --> 03:25:45,750
Uh...

4747
03:25:45,750 --> 03:25:46,710
All the...

4748
03:25:47,250 --> 03:25:47,450
Girls...

4749
03:25:47,450 --> 03:25:48,450
Plus one guy.

4750
03:25:48,950 --> 03:25:50,190
Ha ha ha ha!

4751
03:25:50,950 --> 03:25:51,190
Ha ha ha!

4752
03:25:51,210 --> 03:25:51,690
Ha ha ha!

4753
03:25:52,410 --> 03:25:52,810
Um...

4754
03:25:52,810 --> 03:25:54,050
After everything that happened.

4755
03:25:54,770 --> 03:25:55,090
Um...

4756
03:25:55,090 --> 03:25:56,710
Minna is having her five year anniversary.

4757
03:25:57,070 --> 03:25:57,890
And like I said...

4758
03:25:57,890 --> 03:25:59,110
There is a collab going on...

4759
03:25:59,110 --> 03:25:59,630
For those that...

4760
03:25:59,630 --> 03:26:01,570
For the girls that were supposed to debut...

4761
03:26:01,570 --> 03:26:02,110

Please support all of them.

03:26:07,210 --> 03:26:08,130
Not just those girls.

Okay...

Actually that's weird to say.

4838
03:27:14,710 --> 03:27:15,050
After I said...

4839
03:27:15,050 --> 03:27:15,810

Reflexive thing, you know?

03:27:22,490 --> 03:27:23,350
