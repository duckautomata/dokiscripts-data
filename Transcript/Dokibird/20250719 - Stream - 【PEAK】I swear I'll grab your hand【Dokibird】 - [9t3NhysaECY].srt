1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,820
Remember what it is.

2
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:02,000
Hold on, let me go to Twitch.

3
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:04,660
Alright, I'm inviting friends right now.

4
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,100
Um... Okay.

5
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:08,480
Wait, I went straight in live.

6
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:08,900
No intro.

7
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:09,520
Oh my god, wait!

8
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:10,100
Someone's streaming!

9
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:10,900
Oh my god, sorry.

10
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,540
No intro.

11
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:15,540
Either way, I've been live this whole time.

12
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,460
This is me, Laimu.

13
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:19,280
What did you say?

14
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,920
It's a real account, I promise.

15
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,020
Super real, totally legit.

16
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:26,260
Oh, you sent the thing.

17
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:27,360
Yeah, I sent it.

18
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,540
Oh wait, it says invited you, but it doesn't show up.

19
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:31,840
Like, there's no, like, join.

20
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:33,240
There's no join?

21
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:34,360
Yeah.

22
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:37,300
Can you join my lobby just through this thing?

23
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:38,580
I'll see if I can.

24
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:40,700
It says you're playing VTube Studio.

25
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:41,860
Oh, exactly.

26
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,120
Wait, how do you change how you don't run the non-Steam version of VTube Studio?

27
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:49,000
I do run without Steam.

28
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:50,540
No, I run without Steam.

29
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:52,260
But instead it tells me that I'm playing VBridger.

30
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:53,880
Oh, yes.

31
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,460
Oh, I didn't know you could do it without Steam.

32
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,080
Yeah, I know you can.

33
00:00:58,420 --> 00:00:59,280
It's very less performance intensive.

34
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,880
You have to do it, like, on the...

35
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,180
You can do it for VBridger too.

36
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:04,020
Yeah, the file.

37
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:05,460
It's, like, on the...

38
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:08,980
You open where the file is, and you just click the .ex file.

39
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:16,120
There's where you click, like, open file location, and then you'll see, like, VTube Studio.

40
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:16,440
Yeah.

41
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,140
And then it'll be, like, VTube Studio without Steam.

42
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,620
Without Steam.

43
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:21,520
Yeah, yeah.

44
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:23,800
How do you change what you look like?

45
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:24,000
Scary.

46
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,060
I don't want to be green.

47
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:26,000
Oh, look at your passport.

48
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:27,460
Are you wearing my...

49
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:27,980
Passport?

50
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,700
How do I get in?

51
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:29,620
Yeah, how do I get in?

52
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:30,020
Let me in!

53
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:32,340
Wait a sec, I'm customizing my character.

54
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:32,840
No!

55
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,040
Let us in!

56
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:34,680
That is my point!

57
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:35,680
That is my point!

58
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:36,560
Let us in!

59
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,140
I can't join Donkey because she's playing VTube Studio.

60
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:44,680
Okay, I'll show myself online on Steam.

61
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:45,480
I don't want this.

62
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,440
You are already online.

63
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,120
It just says you're playing VTube Studio.

64
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:49,280
Oh, my God.

65
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,440
Let us in!

66
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:52,480
Let us in!

67
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,060
Let us in!

68
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,860
How do you guys see it?

69
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,380
Everything is private.

70
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,660
I don't know.

71
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:01,580
I don't know.

72
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:04,380
Clearly, there's a, like, security breach.

73
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,280
Oh, there is.

74
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,440
So, like, you guys are preaching my security right now.

75
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:09,120
All right.

76
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:09,860
Let me in!

77
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,180
All right, here we go.

78
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:14,260
You guys should go see game details.

79
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:15,880
And then I'll invite people now.

80
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,020
They'll invite people now.

81
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,820
Yeah, now I'll invite people.

82
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,400
I invited...

83
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,520
Lamu.

84
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,260
I invited Mint.

85
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,560
Where is it?

86
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,500
No, it's the same thing.

87
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:30,820
I'm still seeing...

88
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,360
I'm still seeing VTube Studio.

89
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:33,140
What the fuck?

90
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,140
It looks like this.

91
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,460
It looks like this.

92
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,440
Okay, I'm gonna reboot the game.

93
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,040
I'll reboot the game.

94
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:39,400
That might help.

95
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:43,100
I can never remember what order you're supposed to open stuff up in to make that work properly.

96
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,460
Wait, there's an order?

97
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:45,760
Oh, my gosh.

98
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,560
I didn't know that either.

99
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:47,340
I didn't know that either.

100
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,880
One game will, like, supersede the other.

101
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,100
Like...

102
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:53,240
I think it's the one you do first, which is annoying.

103
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:56,460
But maybe if you add VTube Studio to your private games?

104
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,820
Like, if it was, like, an illicit creepy...

105
00:02:58,820 --> 00:02:59,580
Wait, I can add them to my porn one or something?

106
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,900
I'm learning so much right now.

107
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,000
I thought that...

108
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,120
I don't want people to know I'm a VTuber.

109
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:07,940
If you were ashamed to be playing VTube Studio or something...

110
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,480
Oh, I don't want anyone to know I'm a VTuber.

111
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,740
Personal confession.

112
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,220
Can I have...

113
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:17,080
Can I also blast a game to everybody so that they know that I'm playing?

114
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:17,840
Orc Massage.

115
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:18,140
Really?

116
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,300
You want everyone to know you're playing Orc Massage?

117
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:26,040
You've never been, like, the victim of somebody booting up, like, Skyrim's script extender, like, 500 times?

118
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:26,640
Yes.

119
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:32,460
You know, like, old YouTube montage videos in the bottom right corner?

120
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,920
You'll see such-and-such has begun playing Team Fortress 2.

121
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,400
Over and over again.

122
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,740
Over and over again.

123
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,200
Yay, I got the invite.

124
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,040
Okay, I guess I had to boot it.

125
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:41,640
I'm gonna...

126
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,560
Oh, I got it too!

127
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:43,420
Yay!

128
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,340
Failed to find Lobby.

129
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,400
Okay, well, that's on you.

130
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,040
That's on still.

131
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:49,580
Okay.

132
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:51,560
Mint.

133
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:53,640
Oh, I got it.

134
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:54,700
Snuffy, what is...

135
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:55,860
Are you not inviting me?

136
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,280
Wait, are you not just...

137
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,500
Are you not called Snuffy?

138
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,360
What the fuck is your name on Steam?

139
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:01,780
I'm...

140
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:02,500
It's Snum?

141
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:03,600
Oh, okay.

142
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,960
Who the fuck is Snuffy?

143
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:06,420
Snum.

144
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,280
Okay, there is no Snum on my...

145
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,180
Are you a pure offline?

146
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,080
You're a pure offline.

147
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,060
You're a pure offline, aren't you?

148
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:12,800
I would've messaged you.

149
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:13,140
Hello?

150
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,380
You are not on the fucking...

151
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,000
Choose friend to invest.

152
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:19,780
Oh, hi...

153
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:21,620
I'm muting everybody in Discord.

154
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:22,760
You're a pure offline!

155
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,200
You're a pure offline!

156
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,200
It's not even my fault!

157
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:26,360
I would just blast everyone's volume in this goddamn game.

158
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,660
Everyone is so peaky.

159
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:27,840
What?

160
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,120
It's awful.

161
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,320
You're gonna take this from me?

162
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:29,640
Okay?

163
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,480
You're not going on vacation with us.

164
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,320
You're gonna be left behind.

165
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,240
This is a vacation?

166
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,100
You're gonna be left behind from this vacation.

167
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,400
How do I use my passport?

168
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,700
All right, I'm muting myself.

169
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:45,300
I'm putting myself on low now.

170
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:46,360
Okay, cool.

171
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,100
All right, Snuffy.

172
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:53,600
Snuffy, remember to, like, instead to deafen, to just, like, un-deafen and turn us down so we can still see your foogie.

173
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:54,240
Oh, yeah.

174
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,280
So we'll know you're alive or not.

175
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,060
Yeah.

176
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:02,560
You have to promise not to actually turn me back up because I'm gonna be talking to my chat and I'm gonna be talking mad shit.

177
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:03,380
Yeah, exactly.

178
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:04,800
All right, now...

179
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,640
All right, give me a sec.

180
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:07,140
I'm gonna put on my makeup.

181
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,000
I gotta change myself.

182
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,740
Megan, your eyebrows just got angrier.

183
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:15,340
Give me a sec.

184
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,360
I gotta be angry.

185
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,520
I gotta get serious, guys.

186
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:19,800
Lock in.

187
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,160
This is a serious game for serious gamers.

188
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,100
Charlie Brown.

189
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,120
Give me Charlie Brown.

190
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,120
Wait, which round are you doing?

191
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,900
You're muting everyone else, right?

192
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:35,940
Yeah, I'm turning everyone else down, but I'll still see the foogies.

193
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:42,180
I can't wait for, like, in four months from now when we do another game via Discord and we can't figure out why we can't hear each other again.

194
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:42,980
Yeah.

195
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,940
This is how I feel right now.

196
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:48,580
Whoa, whoa.

197
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:48,940
Whoa, whoa.

198
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:49,780
You're stanned.

199
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:52,820
I've never played this game.

200
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,180
Actually, I've never played this game.

201
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:55,900
I haven't watched anyone play this game.

202
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:56,300
Me too.

203
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,320
I've watched people play this game, but...

204
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,200
It's going to be very exciting.

205
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,680
I haven't...

206
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,420
I haven't, like, played it myself.

207
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,960
I waited till this very moment to play this game.

208
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:06,460
Me too.

209
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:07,820
The first sloppy experience?

210
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:08,120
Yeah.

211
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,000
That's amazing.

212
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,720
Did you two play it yet or no?

213
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:16,320
I played it when it came out, so if we can be, like, Snuffy and I can be, like, the tour guides.

214
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,680
Alright, this is...

215
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,320
You're so mad.

216
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:24,740
Wait, this is, like, all of us.

217
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,920
This is so good.

218
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,120
Alright, this is how I feel.

219
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,880
Wait, you have glasses.

220
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:33,960
Yeah.

221
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,740
How did you get glasses?

222
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,000
How do I take...

223
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,260
Oh, there we go.

224
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,280
Uh, Snuffy, if you've been talking, we can't hear you.

225
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,660
It's not that we don't love you and we're ignoring you or anything.

226
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,920
It's literally we can't hear you.

227
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,800
You're just kind of Dreamworks facing us silently.

228
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,740
Yeah, it's actually really creepy.

229
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,520
Oh, there you go.

230
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,280
Yeah, you're talking.

231
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:51,980
You're talking now.

232
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:52,460
What...

233
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,380
How are you...

234
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:53,720
Dead?

235
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:54,940
Ew!

236
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:55,360
Ew!

237
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,160
I put on voice activation.

238
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:58,940
Okay, there we go.

239
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,620
We can hear you now.

240
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,040
Yeah, we can hear you.

241
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,800
But how did you get sunglasses?

242
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,100
I want sunglasses.

243
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:05,960
Oh, there it is.

244
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:06,700
I see it.

245
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,140
I want to be angry.

246
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,100
Don't take my glasses.

247
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:09,800
I'm...

248
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:13,800
I played it and I got really obsessed with trying to, like, beat it.

249
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,680
Because I thought it was, like, a cozy game.

250
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,220
And then I realized that it's a game of nothing but trials and tribulations.

251
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,220
It's not cozy?

252
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:24,680
No, apparently it's not cozy.

253
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,880
No, it's...

254
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,200
Oh, Snuffy, you're a bit quiet.

255
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:28,220
It's quite stressful.

256
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:29,560
Wait, Snuffy, you're a bit quiet.

257
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,640
Can you turn up...

258
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,300
Is it possible to turn up people's volumes in game or no?

259
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,520
Uh, yeah, hit escape.

260
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:34,840
Is this better?

261
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,320
Oh my god!

262
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:36,780
Oh!

263
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:37,640
No, it's okay.

264
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:38,580
Keep your...

265
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:39,420
Keep your old...

266
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:39,920
Keep your...

267
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,600
Keep your old volume.

268
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:44,420
Keep your...

269
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,800
Okay, um...

270
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,260
I'll turn you up on my end.

271
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:50,720
It's okay.

272
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,060
Keep your old volume.

273
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,080
Oh my god.

274
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,260
Okay, okay.

275
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:54,400
Okay.

276
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:55,480
Alright.

277
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:55,900
Death.

278
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,480
Alright, I'm ready.

279
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,200
Uh, but yeah.

280
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,260
How do you turn up individual people?

281
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:03,180
Uh, but yeah.

282
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,100
Escape, press escape.

283
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:04,660
Uh, hit escape top right corner.

284
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:06,860
Oh, I see, I see.

285
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:07,580
Okay.

286
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,300
I have to turn everyone down to like 30%, otherwise I go fucking deaf in this game.

287
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:12,160
Oh.

288
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,820
It's not that loud on my end.

289
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,460
Yeah, you guys...

290
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:16,300
You guys sound great.

291
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:16,720
Yeah.

292
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:18,280
Alright, let's see.

293
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,700
Do you wish to know how to climb?

294
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,180
Yes, how do you climb?

295
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:22,460
Oh, there's a trial.

296
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:23,000
Okay.

297
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,080
Left click.

298
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:24,420
Alright.

299
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,080
There's a rope.

300
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,160
This is...

301
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:26,780
I can do this.

302
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:27,280
Let me go.

303
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,080
I'm ready.

304
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:29,360
Cowabunga, dude.

305
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,160
I'm ready for my vacation.

306
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:38,200
And the thing that you can do is when you're on like top of the cliff, if you right click you hold on your arm and you lift your friends up.

307
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:39,460
Like that.

308
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:39,820
Okay.

309
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:40,860
Alright.

310
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:41,660
What do you do?

311
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:42,040
You put...

312
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:42,620
I got your...

313
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:42,920
Oh, okay.

314
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:43,620
You don't need...

315
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:44,500
Oh, right click.

316
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,400
Oh, okay.

317
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:47,980
I got you.

318
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,160
Yeah, you literally don't dip.

319
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:49,640
Oh, no.

320
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,780
Wait, did you just push her off?

321
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,200
No, she fell.

322
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,220
She fell off.

323
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:56,980
Nice.

324
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,520
There's actually a mod where you can push people off too.

325
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,180
That's what the...

326
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:04,600
I wanna play that mod.

327
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:05,600
That's what the...

328
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,040
I wish...

329
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,440
Dude, the rocks don't matter.

330
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:09,320
I'm just climbing.

331
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,500
I wish I got the Mount Everest mod working.

332
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,360
No, you can climb any surface except if it's raining and then it will...

333
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:14,980
You'll take more.

334
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,760
Yeah, I'm alive.

335
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:17,420
There's no...

336
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:18,680
Guys, there's no fall damage.

337
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:19,680
You get fucked.

338
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,060
No, there's fall damage.

339
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,080
Guys, I survived.

340
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,400
There's no fall damage from what I learned.

341
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:27,500
There's no fall damage.

342
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:27,920
Yeah.

343
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:28,260
See?

344
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:29,460
Wee!

345
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,580
I'm okay.

346
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:31,960
Wee!

347
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,140
Yeah, definitely.

348
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,500
You should definitely get straight into the game and jump off the cliff.

349
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:35,120
It'll be fine.

350
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:35,880
Okay.

351
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:36,700
Yay!

352
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:39,640
That's what my tour guide told us.

353
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,320
Thank you.

354
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,960
You know, like, right...

355
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:49,800
Yesterday I was watching videos of, like, um, uh, freakiest cave... cave climbing depths and everything.

356
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,220
Oh my god, that's scary.

357
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:52,440
And...

358
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,980
Yeah, and then they were talking... cave diving.

359
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:54,400
I can live that today.

360
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,420
People that are like cave...

361
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:55,680
You know?

362
00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:00,080
Like, those who, like, dive in c- like, fucking caves and there's, like, water in there and everything.

363
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:01,000
No!

364
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,960
And, then, like, like...

365
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,160
people that go into caves and they get...

366
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:04,460
Yeah, yeah.

367
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,320
Start diving in c- yeah.

368
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,860
Cause, like, like, that's not working right now.

369
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:24,360
They're just like stance, up,

370
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:34,540
There was one where, like... I'm talking about cave diving.

371
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,560
You know what that is?

372
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,940
No, I don't know.

373
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:39,440
Tell me.

374
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:40,180
Tell me.

375
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:45,400
Okay, so it's like you go in a cave and you, like, dive in the cave and that's why...

376
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,560
and there's, like, water there and that's why you have to dive.

377
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:57,720
And then... And then, like, sometimes people die in there because, like, you're in the water.

378
00:10:58,740 --> 00:10:58,920
What?

379
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:00,480
Do they die or do they die?

380
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:01,680
They die.

381
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,060
They die.

382
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,000
And then they die.

383
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:08,380
They should have just brought the V with them.

384
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:09,040
What the heck?

385
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:15,960
It's because, okay, so, like, in one of the incidents, because of the tour, it's the tour guide's fault.

386
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,740
So, like, that's what I mean.

387
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:20,360
It's gonna be all Lybu's fault that we die.

388
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:25,000
Wait, what the... What the... Holy shit, that was a huge detour just to blame you.

389
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,560
Yeah, that's where it was gonna go.

390
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:30,920
I was like, what's the point of this story?

391
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,100
In one of the...

392
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,700
Yeah, you were, like, a trumpet of tangent for that.

393
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:35,700
Holy moly.

394
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,080
I thought you were just gonna...

395
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,640
That's all I wanted to say.

396
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:41,000
It was a crazy video, though.

397
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:41,800
It was...

398
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,980
Because the tour guide...

399
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:51,040
Because the tour guide was like, we should go dive in this cave, you know, to go cave diving.

400
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,200
And they're like, oh, it's very dangerous.

401
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,900
But he's like, no, we got this.

402
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,240
And then...

403
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,920
And then everyone died.

404
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:10,300
How did you do your emotes?

405
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:13,280
Oh, R?

406
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:13,760
Nice.

407
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,300
Okay, you guys can stare until I just woke up, right?

408
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:18,980
Yeah.

409
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,760
That's what it feels like.

410
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:23,700
Yeah.

411
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,580
I guess we all have little...

412
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:26,160
There's a mirror.

413
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:26,980
There's a mirror.

414
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,060
There's a mirror.

415
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:28,900
You gotta practice that.

416
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:29,480
Don't sing it.

417
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:30,800
Oh!

418
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,840
Oh, nice.

419
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:36,800
I think everybody's like drunk at the airport.

420
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:37,840
I don't know what's going on.

421
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:38,900
She's like...

422
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,560
We're in one of those...

423
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:40,940
Yeah!

424
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,040
Don't worry, guys.

425
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,140
We're gonna survive.

426
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:49,540
Just like the boys in the...

427
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:50,900
In the...

428
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:51,100
In that...

429
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:51,980
Firefly book.

430
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,180
Lord of the Flies.

431
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:55,980
We're gonna...

432
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,900
We're gonna...

433
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,920
He's gonna be the boys in Laurie of the Flies.

434
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:03,400
We're gonna be the boys in Laurie of the Flies.

435
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:04,620
You six boys were real gasping about.

436
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:06,080
Ahahaha!

437
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,140
Oh my gosh, so ready...

438
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:09,620
Are you ready?

439
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,700
I'm ready.

440
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:11,360
I'm going to board us.

441
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,000
I'm ready.

442
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:12,580
Yea.

443
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:12,620
Yeah.

444
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:13,320
Nice boy of the lambs.

445
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:16,980
Let's go.

446
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,580
So how's the volume going?

447
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:21,040
Stop.

448
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,080
Is the volume okay?

449
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:28,280
I feel like I caught the stupid from both of you.

450
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,220
We caught the stupid!

451
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,760
We were bored this way!

452
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:35,820
What?!

453
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,400
Oh my god, we're dead?!

454
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,480
It is Lord of the Flags!

455
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:40,400
Oh my god!

456
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:45,060
I told you it is Lord of the Flags!

457
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:47,820
We are the boys in the Lord of the Flags book!

458
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:50,180
I thought we were going for a hike!

459
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:56,640
Oh my god, we're actually... Okay, how to not die.

460
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,260
I'm reading the book, don't worry.

461
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,120
I can read.

462
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:01,960
How do I flip the page?

463
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:03,060
Oh, okay.

464
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:04,980
Okay, okay.

465
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,880
Never abandon a friend in need.

466
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:11,940
The point is...

467
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:13,420
Wait, you can run!

468
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,720
Guys, you can run and you press shift!

469
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,420
Hey, Doki, come and touch this with your face.

470
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:19,200
Okay, wait.

471
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,440
Give me a sec.

472
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,600
I'm trying to figure out how to...

473
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,220
How to say a lie.

474
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,520
It's okay, just walk towards my voice.

475
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:26,400
Okay.

476
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:27,220
That's...

477
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,860
I don't know what this is.

478
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,480
His name is Dingbong.

479
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:35,100
Keep an eye out in survival situations.

480
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,920
Oh my god, Doki!

481
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,880
Wait, I'm poison!

482
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:41,580
I'm poison!

483
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:42,540
Oh my god, oh my god.

484
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,680
Does anybody know first thing?

485
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,300
I have no idea how that happened.

486
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,220
What did I slip?

487
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,460
Oh my god, can someone pee?

488
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,500
Oh my god, the man of war, Jellyfish, quick!

489
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:52,900
Everybody start peeing on me.

490
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:55,340
Everyone, everyone, everyone, don't worry.

491
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,060
Alright, everyone start peeing.

492
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:59,060
Everyone, I'm not...

493
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:01,540
No!

494
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:03,420
Somebody help!

495
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,320
It's okay, it's okay!

496
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,840
It's alright, I'm gonna start.

497
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:09,600
Don't worry.

498
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,300
You know it's poisonous, Myth.

499
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:14,080
I'm warning you.

500
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,620
I know, someone help me.

501
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:16,420
I've been stuck.

502
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,440
Oh, yeah, lie down, Myth.

503
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,040
Sloppy, I'm stuck.

504
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,640
We're so...

505
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,200
How did you get the backpack?

506
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:28,160
Ew, there's one backpack and I took it.

507
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,660
Oh, how did you wear it?

508
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,680
You can just open it on your back.

509
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,060
You can just take what's in there.

510
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,160
Wait, I have a compass.

511
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,720
What do I do with this?

512
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,920
Super useful.

513
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,260
It points to north.

514
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:38,620
Oh, yes.

515
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,100
Oh, wait, I'm getting unpoisoned.

516
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,040
Wait, I'm getting hungry.

517
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:44,620
I'm gonna get a coconut.

518
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:46,580
Oh, coconut!

519
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,320
Wait, is this a survival game or...?

520
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,600
Yeah, we have to climb.

521
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,320
You see that big mountain in the distance?

522
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:53,180
Yeah.

523
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:53,800
We're gonna get up there.

524
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,600
Yeah, and that's all we have to climb.

525
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,540
And that's...

526
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:57,440
Yeah, definitely.

527
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,080
...how we win the game.

528
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:01,400
Yeah, definitely.

529
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,040
Look at Lime go.

530
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:02,440
What's that?

531
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,220
Is that a crab?

532
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,600
Look at her go.

533
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,440
She's grabbing the coconut.

534
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:06,820
Oh, no.

535
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:08,000
That's another thing that I...

536
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:08,280
She's gonna...

537
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:08,440
No.

538
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:09,000
No.

539
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:09,720
She's got...

540
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,200
Don't worry.

541
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:10,860
I got you.

542
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,080
Don't worry.

543
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,060
Land on us.

544
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:13,900
We got you.

545
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,380
Oh, I did it.

546
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:16,960
Can I get...

547
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,380
I'll climb.

548
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:17,900
Ow!

549
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,080
I'll climb.

550
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,080
Sorry, it's Jordan Brickley for the coconut.

551
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:23,820
This is Lord of the Flags.

552
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:24,860
You won't.

553
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:25,440
Fuck you.

554
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,220
I'm eating it right now.

555
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:28,640
Okay.

556
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,920
I'm gonna eat it.

557
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:30,720
That's right.

558
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:31,580
I'm not done.

559
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,240
How do you climb the tree?

560
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:34,440
I wanna be a little monkey.

561
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,060
Same...

562
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:35,920
Same like the...

563
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:36,720
Same as the cliff.

564
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,400
Like this, see?

565
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:37,820
Okay.

566
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:39,500
I was like...

567
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,260
Get the coconut when you're at the top.

568
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:43,500
I'm gonna get it.

569
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:44,240
I'm gonna get it.

570
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,260
Get it.

571
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:45,540
Get it.

572
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:46,640
It's mine.

573
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:48,960
Oh.

574
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,000
I broke my legs.

575
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:52,780
Oh.

576
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,680
I broke my legs.

577
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:56,920
That's like you're right.

578
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:57,740
I'm eating this.

579
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,760
Yum yum yum.

580
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:00,860
Wait, it doesn't heal me.

581
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:02,880
No, no.

582
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,280
You need bandages for that.

583
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:04,460
It doesn't heal you.

584
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,040
Oh, wait.

585
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,260
I ate it though.

586
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,060
You fell off the tree.

587
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:07,880
I ate it.

588
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:08,780
I thought...

589
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:09,180
I lived.

590
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,100
Probably because I landed on your big ass head.

591
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:12,960
That's it.

592
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,680
Stop climbing this other tree.

593
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,280
Guys, we gotta survive.

594
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,420
I wanna taste the sweet, sweet, succulent coconut, please.

595
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:21,700
Guys, I have a broken leg.

596
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,560
I ate the other coconut too.

597
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:24,420
Wait, there's another coconut.

598
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,940
Min, climb that tree.

599
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,280
There's a flying jellyfish.

600
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:27,780
There's a flying jellyfish.

601
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:28,180
Wait.

602
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,960
As long as it's not just me.

603
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,320
Min, go climb this tree.

604
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,160
We need more coconut or we'll die.

605
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,200
Ooh, there are other things other than coconuts.

606
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:37,740
Stop.

607
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:38,400
Stop.

608
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:38,980
Stop.

609
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:41,060
Stop.

610
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:41,820
Stop.

611
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:43,560
Stop.

612
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,300
That is unnatural.

613
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:44,940
Stop.

614
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,740
I see my hello kitty luggage in there.

615
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,520
I lost my blood.

616
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:50,560
What did you get in your luggage?

617
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:50,880
Yeah.

618
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:53,140
Steffi, what did you bring to the vacation?

619
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,680
Wait, this is literally like the age-old question.

620
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:58,060
Like, if you got stranded on an island, what are you taking?

621
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:58,760
It's like who...

622
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,120
Oh yeah, and then...

623
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,520
The only thing is we need to stick together.

624
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,980
Because if we don't, the Scoutmaster will be mad at us.

625
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,220
And then who do you think...

626
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:06,740
It's like, who do you think will survive on an island?

627
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:07,520
I know I'm...

628
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,120
Not me.

629
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,160
That's for sure.

630
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,880
Or he broke my leg.

631
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:17,160
I broke my leg in the first five minutes.

632
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,040
Oh!

633
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:19,780
Nap bus!

634
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,820
We need to test it to make sure it's not poisonous though.

635
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:21,980
Don't worry.

636
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,480
It's not poisonous.

637
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:25,760
There's a trail mix over here.

638
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,220
It's not.

639
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,000
Oh, oh.

640
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,100
Wait, there's mushrooms!

641
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:29,820
Wait.

642
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:30,900
You guys need this.

643
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:31,640
Wait a minute.

644
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,640
I ate this already.

645
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:33,680
It's not poisonous.

646
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:34,720
If you're hungry.

647
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,540
Do these come in?

648
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:35,860
What's that?

649
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:36,840
It's a mushroom.

650
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:38,740
Take the medicinal root and eat it, Doki.

651
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:39,380
You'll feel better.

652
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:40,000
Oh, okay.

653
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:40,720
Give me a sec.

654
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:41,900
Cluster shroom.

655
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,000
This is an ancient herb.

656
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:43,620
I'm gonna feed it to you.

657
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,140
With medicinal properties.

658
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:46,400
I already ate it.

659
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:47,940
Oh.

660
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,160
Wait, am I still hungry?

661
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:49,560
Is the shroom good?

662
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:50,680
Are you still hungry?

663
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:51,560
Yeah, the shroom's good.

664
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,320
I already ate one.

665
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:54,880
Okay.

666
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:55,740
Okay.

667
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:58,660
Excuse me, but mushrooms are really dangerous, you guys.

668
00:18:58,860 --> 00:18:59,880
We shouldn't mess around.

669
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,280
No, we have Doki to poison test it.

670
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,560
Yeah, I already broke my leg.

671
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,200
It's fine.

672
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,680
Wait, you fucking lied.

673
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:07,560
It's poisonous.

674
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:13,720
That's for breaking my leg.

675
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:15,740
You deserve it.

676
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:16,860
Why did I break your leg?

677
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:17,840
That is right.

678
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:19,720
You let it happen.

679
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:20,760
You broke your fucking leg.

680
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:23,040
You didn't cushion my fall.

681
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,920
That's what you get.

682
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,400
Hey.

683
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,420
There's another luggage.

684
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:32,240
Oh, hey.

685
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:33,800
Mint?

686
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:35,560
Mint?

687
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:36,480
Mint?

688
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:36,960
Mint?

689
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:37,040
Mint?

690
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:37,680
Is she okay?

691
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,220
I get pranked.

692
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:45,720
Okay.

693
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,660
Oh, can I have that?

694
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:48,720
All right.

695
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:49,400
Where do we go?

696
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,940
Oh, there's so many luggage.

697
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:56,440
Wait, how many people have died on this mountain?

698
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,780
There's so many things.

699
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:58,580
Oh, hey, look.

700
00:19:59,080 --> 00:19:59,940
Watch this.

701
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:01,820
I think it's just all our luggage.

702
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:02,520
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

703
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:03,180
Watch this.

704
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:05,360
Give us a head start.

705
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,100
We definitely should have used that there, yes.

706
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:09,680
Yay!

707
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,060
I'm a hero, everyone.

708
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:16,640
You might have broken her other leg if we didn't use this here.

709
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:17,480
Yeah, exactly.

710
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,980
It's for the sake of my leg.

711
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,080
Look, see, my thing.

712
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:22,860
Oh, my God, yes.

713
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:25,560
Look, and then I got water for us.

714
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,180
Look at that.

715
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,120
And I got... Oh, my God, wait.

716
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:29,800
I'm glad to hear it.

717
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:30,980
Oh, my God, wait.

718
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,920
Wait, is that... Oh, my God.

719
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,400
That's a bad... Look at that.

720
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,080
I'm cured.

721
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,120
Watch that urchin, it will poison you again.

722
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,100
Look at that.

723
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:38,780
I'm cured.

724
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:39,320
Yeah.

725
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,940
I got the bandits.

726
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,680
I don't think this is the best route to go.

727
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,440
We're going, like, the absolute worst.

728
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:48,580
Wait, do you have space on your inventory, Snuffy?

729
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,480
No, I don't.

730
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,240
But we can put it in Lemo's backpack.

731
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:52,960
Oh, that's true.

732
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:53,660
That's true.

733
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,240
I want to put this on her backpack.

734
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:55,740
I'm grabbing it.

735
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,580
I'm grabbing it, too.

736
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:57,920
You gonna root around in my backpack?

737
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:58,780
Okay, be gentle.

738
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,480
Yeah, I got it.

739
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:00,760
I got stuff in her backpack.

740
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:03,400
Where?

741
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,040
I think someone took something out of it.

742
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,360
You stole my fucking drink.

743
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:08,920
Um... No, you're okay.

744
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:09,560
You're fine.

745
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,960
Wait, where are we supposed to go?

746
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:11,640
Up here?

747
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,000
Shouldn't we go left side?

748
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,040
I've not played this one yet.

749
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:17,540
Maybe on the left side?

750
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:18,120
I've got the lantern.

751
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,280
Oh, cool.

752
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:20,580
I'm probably this way.

753
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,140
Wait, where... Who said that?

754
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,040
This way.

755
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:26,240
Oh, middle mouse button you can, like, point.

756
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:27,140
Yeah.

757
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:27,700
Oh.

758
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:28,560
This way.

759
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,060
Oh, really?

760
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:29,820
Oh, cool!

761
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:29,820
No.

762
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:33,860
What's up?

763
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,740
It's mad.

764
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:37,940
What?

765
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,240
Oh, fuck!

766
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:41,560
I took my other leg!

767
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:49,540
I thought... I thought she was so... I thought she... I could make it.

768
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,000
I thought I could make it.

769
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:51,320
How do you go down?

770
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,760
I thought I could make it.

771
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:56,420
Please!

772
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:57,620
It's a problem.

773
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:57,920
I'm slow.

774
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,120
I need help!

775
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,720
Okay, I need help.

776
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:05,980
Okay, wait, wait, wait, Toki.

777
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,720
I've got a remedy for you.

778
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:08,440
I have my arm.

779
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:08,920
I'm going!

780
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:10,540
I'm going!

781
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:11,520
I'm climbing!

782
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,600
Let me... Grab your...

783
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,300
Alright, don't worry.

784
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:16,440
I can... I'll help next one.

785
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:17,500
I'll help next one.

786
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:19,500
Alright, grab my hand!

787
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:20,400
Grab my hand!

788
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:23,720
Grab my hand!

789
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,120
Grab my hand!

790
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,280
No, wait, who are we asking?

791
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,200
We're Snuffy.

792
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:32,680
We're Snuffy.

793
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,440
Grab my hand!

794
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,500
No, my hand!

795
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,320
My hand is the same hand!

796
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:42,220
No, my hand!

797
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,180
Get your ass!

798
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:44,180
I will push you down!

799
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:46,720
I will push you off this cliff!

800
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,200
Snuffy!

801
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:51,720
Snuffy!

802
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:52,440
Snuffy!

803
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:52,880
Grab my hand!

804
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,880
It's so mean!

805
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,380
It's so gross!

806
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:05,190
It's so gross!

807
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,140
It's so gross!

808
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:12,440
I told you not to trust her!

809
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:14,500
I told you not to trust her!

810
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,380
Oh, God.

811
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:22,460
We're gonna make it, guys.

812
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:23,480
We're gonna...

813
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:27,160
We're gonna get our badge from the Scoutmaster.

814
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:30,100
That means we've pushed around for so long, but the fog is already coming.

815
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:31,480
Wait, there's a fog?

816
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:31,820
It was...

817
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:32,200
It was...

818
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:32,720
It was...

819
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,440
I need a hand!

820
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:39,160
Someone let down their golden hand!

821
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,460
Wait, wait...

822
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:43,820
Someone let down their golden hand!

823
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:47,920
Please!

824
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,600
Stop for your own turn, please!

825
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:50,840
Please!

826
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:53,900
I'm fixed!

827
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:54,980
I did it!

828
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,620
Are you good?

829
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:58,940
Yeah, I'm good.

830
00:23:59,200 --> 00:23:59,580
Grab my hand!

831
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:00,200
Grab my hand!

832
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,000
There's so much...

833
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:03,680
Oh my God, Bryden!

834
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:04,380
You're gonna fall!

835
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,780
That's so scary!

836
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,680
Oh my God, that totally doesn't look like you can make it.

837
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,740
This looks like pro gamer moves that I'm abusing on.

838
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,700
Oh my God, my heart!

839
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,320
I'm okay!

840
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:17,120
Don't worry, I have one too!

841
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:18,040
No, this is not a good route.

842
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,820
This is not a good route.

843
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:20,180
Did we mess up?

844
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:20,840
Did we mess up?

845
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,800
Should we climb down here and try a different one?

846
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,460
I don't know.

847
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:28,740
So, we want any ledges that have this sandy texture, because that means we can climb it.

848
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:32,220
If it doesn't have the orange, then we can't, like, stand there.

849
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:35,160
So we wanna try, like, up here has, like...

850
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,060
There's, like, sort of...

851
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:36,600
Oh, the sand!

852
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,320
Whoa!

853
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,100
Wait, there's, like, something up here!

854
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:39,920
Do you guys see that?

855
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,300
Oh, yeah, we...

856
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,600
Maybe we can make that.

857
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:45,440
Okay, who if it was the one that wasted the gun thing?

858
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,640
Wait, I have this!

859
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:49,680
Is this helpful?

860
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,120
I have this.

861
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,800
Okay, that's definitely not helpful.

862
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,360
Oh, oh!

863
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,420
Okay, okay!

864
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,240
Let me grab your hand!

865
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:02,520
Grab my hand!

866
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:03,340
Take it!

867
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:04,960
Oh my God!

868
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:10,760
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

869
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:12,440
I have an idea.

870
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,820
Okay, I have an idea.

871
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:16,920
Yeah.

872
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:18,020
Okay.

873
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:22,980
Where's the head?

874
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:26,340
Where's the... Sorry, I forgot.

875
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,320
What do you mean you forgot?

876
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,880
The whole thing was about grabbing hands!

877
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,140
Is there nothing up there?

878
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:33,840
Wait, wait, wait.

879
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:35,280
Yeah, there's nothing up there.

880
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,740
Wait, then why the fuck did you guys go up there?

881
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,240
Wait, where did Lime went?

882
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:40,400
Where did she go?

883
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:50,880
Um... Wait, can I grab your head?

884
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:51,640
There's nothing.

885
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,860
Oh, no, we're paying back.

886
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,720
Wait, where did Lime go?

887
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:56,840
Did she leave us?

888
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:58,500
I'm down here.

889
00:25:58,660 --> 00:25:59,240
Oh, oh, oh.

890
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:01,660
Which way did you just like to go?

891
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:03,480
Yeah, yeah.

892
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:04,380
Uh-oh.

893
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:04,960
Where are you?

894
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:05,900
I'm not coming to you.

895
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:06,400
I'm sorry.

896
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:07,540
Oh, I'm scared.

897
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:09,700
This is it.

898
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:10,380
This is it for me.

899
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,560
Wait, I might be dead.

900
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:12,560
I might be dead.

901
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:13,000
I might be dead.

902
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,540
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

903
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,000
That didn't break anything more.

904
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,340
I think we want to go slightly around.

905
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:17,600
Okay.

906
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,380
This kind of seems like...

907
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:22,060
Alright, Lamu, you go tell us where to go.

908
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,020
I didn't remember the deed.

909
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:27,820
I'm drinking my drink.

910
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:28,460
Don't push me.

911
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:29,240
Don't do it.

912
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:34,620
Grab my hand!

913
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,280
Grab my hand!

914
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:44,420
I'm gonna try a different one.

915
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:47,920
I'm following Lamu because she knows what she's doing.

916
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:49,160
Are you ready?

917
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:50,840
Are you ready?

918
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,020
I'm ready!

919
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:55,460
Wait, there's a bridge!

920
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,440
Why did we not go through this bridge?

921
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,540
Be careful about this bridge.

922
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:01,420
It doesn't like more than one person on it.

923
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:02,140
Oh.

924
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,600
Can we reach that?

925
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,700
I don't know if I reached that.

926
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:05,700
I believe.

927
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:06,360
I'll watch.

928
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,880
Wait, do you think I can reach it?

929
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:11,340
Yeah!

930
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,300
I did it!

931
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,120
Good job.

932
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,080
Alright!

933
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,400
You know, we can... let's just leave.

934
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:21,540
Transformation Central.

935
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:21,880
Yeah!

936
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:24,240
Are you already suggesting a dungeon of friends?

937
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:25,700
Look, we can...

938
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:28,160
I know there's a checkpoint where we can revive them.

939
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,220
Not to the very top of the mountain.

940
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:33,840
Well, I think we can get there.

941
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:37,040
I don't like... I don't like this mountain.

942
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,700
This mountain is actually kind of nuts.

943
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:39,580
This mountain?

944
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,720
Isn't there like three other mountains after this?

945
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:44,720
Yeah, something like that.

946
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:47,720
Aren't they supposed to be harder than this mountain?

947
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:51,300
Um, the second one I would actually say is the hardest.

948
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,040
Um, hand!

949
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:54,500
Hand!

950
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:54,940
Hand!

951
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:55,440
Hand!

952
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:55,760
Oh!

953
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:57,840
I'm okay.

954
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:00,700
Look how beautiful you are.

955
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:01,140
Yeah!

956
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,880
No, they're fine, right?

957
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:05,600
They're fine.

958
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,680
Are you guys okay over there?

959
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,400
No, they're fine.

960
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:08,020
I see them.

961
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:08,620
They're fine.

962
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:09,700
They're just fucking around.

963
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:13,020
What?

964
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,320
Hello?

965
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:20,780
Wait, what?

966
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:21,360
They died?

967
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,540
No, they're shouting cave and die.

968
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,700
Oh, cave and die.

969
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:32,440
You know like when you dive into a cave and there's a chance you can die while you're cave diving?

970
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:33,440
You know?

971
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:33,860
I see them!

972
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:34,280
I see them!

973
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:34,880
They're over here!

974
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:35,840
Yeah, that's us!

975
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:41,680
We have made like literally no progress.

976
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:42,700
Oh!

977
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:43,080
Oh my god!

978
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:43,420
Oh my god!

979
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,460
I couldn't see on my game!

980
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:45,240
Oh my god!

981
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,640
Oh my monitor died for like five seconds, but I'm okay.

982
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:49,500
Oh no.

983
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,580
Thank you Nvidia drivers!

984
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:52,800
Oh, there's suitcases here.

985
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,020
Oh, that's good.

986
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,420
I don't think we're there.

987
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,400
Oh, there's a white suitcase!

988
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,500
You know that's a bougie suitcase.

989
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,960
This side is so much better.

990
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,760
I thought you guys were supposed to be poor dying.

991
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:06,060
What's in the white suitcase?

992
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,060
Wait, I need a med kit!

993
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,800
I'm, I'm, I'm, I burped too much with my legs.

994
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:12,320
Okay.

995
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,900
Oh, let me eat this apple too.

996
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,820
Oh, I can, I can pick that up.

997
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:19,180
Move her here!

998
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,380
I can, I can hold it.

999
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,140
I have inventory space.

1000
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:22,700
Yeah!

1001
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:26,460
Alright, I'm climbing up.

1002
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:29,220
I'm a little better now.

1003
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:31,660
Have you, have any, has anybody sampled a bungle shroom?

1004
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:33,060
Oh yeah, it was, it was okay.

1005
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,000
I ate that.

1006
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,420
I ate that.

1007
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:37,920
Get my hand!

1008
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,240
This is a trustworthy source.

1009
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:40,540
Pick up my hand!

1010
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:41,100
Okay.

1011
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,800
Hold my hand!

1012
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:53,960
Oh, you don't wanna touch my hand cause there's cooties on it.

1013
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:58,800
Oh my gosh, we're actually making it up the mountain!

1014
00:29:59,140 --> 00:29:59,780
Oh, yay!

1015
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:02,080
Laimu, thank you so much for grabbing my hand!

1016
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:02,900
You're welcome!

1017
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,840
This side of the mountain is so much better.

1018
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,900
Why did we not, why did we not go on this side of the mountain?

1019
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,500
Why did we go the hard way?

1020
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,640
Who, who chose the other realm, hmm?

1021
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:15,340
Who was it?

1022
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:16,820
The weather in the elements.

1023
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,980
Okay, I'm going up this way.

1024
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:20,360
Probably in a bad way.

1025
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,780
Wait, yeah, when did Doki start leaving?

1026
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:22,920
I don't know.

1027
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,140
Wait, there's a bridge here!

1028
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:26,780
Thank you.

1029
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,780
You know that's a good route.

1030
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,080
One at a time on the bridge.

1031
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:31,200
One at a time on the bridge.

1032
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:31,980
One at a time on the bridge.

1033
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,080
How'd you get up there?

1034
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:34,720
I don't know.

1035
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:35,520
Just climb on it.

1036
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,940
But wait until Doki's off.

1037
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,380
Don't have to wait.

1038
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:41,700
Last time I had two people on the bridge and I was okay.

1039
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,600
Why were you guys not doing it one at a time?

1040
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:55,200
You didn't listen to Scoutmaster Lamu's instructions.

1041
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,500
You're not even looking at us.

1042
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:57,520
You don't know what's going on.

1043
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:02,180
I don't have to look to see some...

1044
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:04,440
To see, know when somebody fucked up.

1045
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:08,520
I didn't do anything.

1046
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,480
It was your fat ass that made it loose.

1047
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:15,640
Well, my thing didn't shake when I was on it.

1048
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,360
Oh no.

1049
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:17,940
Oh no.

1050
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:18,520
Oh no!

1051
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,360
Guys, guys!

1052
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,300
I'm gonna break it away!

1053
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:21,840
I'm okay.

1054
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:24,140
I'm okay, by the way.

1055
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:25,260
I'm okay.

1056
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,680
But I think go this way.

1057
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:32,140
I don't know where you are.

1058
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:33,720
Here.

1059
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,000
I'm gonna drop a mushroom.

1060
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:36,040
I hope it helps you come out.

1061
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,040
Oh, I didn't...

1062
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:41,320
Ooh...

1063
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:43,280
Uh, there might be a spot on the slide here.

1064
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:44,420
Okay, give me a sec.

1065
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:48,180
Alright, I'm here now.

1066
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,080
I made it if I had.

1067
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:49,580
Hey, guys.

1068
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:50,400
I'm here.

1069
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:51,720
I got my arm down.

1070
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:52,500
Come up here.

1071
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:53,440
Alright.

1072
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:54,500
Yeah, this way.

1073
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,640
I'm coming up.

1074
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:58,840
I need a hand.

1075
00:31:59,120 --> 00:31:59,460
Don't worry.

1076
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:00,160
My turn.

1077
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:04,040
No, Aibu, no!

1078
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:04,780
No, Aibu!

1079
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:05,640
No, Aibu!

1080
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:06,960
No, Aibu!

1081
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,600
You've been turning your back on Dokibu!

1082
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,640
What did I do?

1083
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:11,680
What did I do?

1084
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,840
What did I do?

1085
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,880
You're a snitch!

1086
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,920
You're a fucking snitch!

1087
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:17,200
Stop it!

1088
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,940
Stitches get stitches, remember that!

1089
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:21,880
Keep your eyes open tonight!

1090
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:24,000
Keep your eyes open tonight!

1091
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,080
Peace!

1092
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:27,640
I don't know if I'll make it.

1093
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,540
Nevermind, I give up.

1094
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:30,240
I know what you did.

1095
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,540
You snitch.

1096
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,440
I believe in this.

1097
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:33,440
You do?

1098
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:34,440
You do?

1099
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:34,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1100
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:36,040
Wait, wait.

1101
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:36,700
Wait, wait.

1102
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,400
I already started.

1103
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,680
Oh, is this it?

1104
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:43,520
Sleep with one eye open, Snuffy.

1105
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,200
Oh, actually, I don't know.

1106
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:45,740
I don't know if you can make this.

1107
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:48,260
I shouldn't have done that!

1108
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:50,580
Sleep with one eye open.

1109
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,340
I'm coming, I'm coming over.

1110
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:59,500
Wait, where's the game?

1111
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,880
Where's the, the whole, everyone else?

1112
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,160
I know.

1113
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:07,280
Yeah, she's alone with me right now.

1114
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:12,320
Just us in this beautiful, large cliff.

1115
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:13,860
In a mushroom.

1116
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:14,600
Hold on.

1117
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,340
I thought you actually died!

1118
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:22,860
You scared me!

1119
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:24,420
I thought I just committed a murder!

1120
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:26,720
It was your fault.

1121
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,100
Wait, what happened?

1122
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:29,140
Wait, oh my god!

1123
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,420
You are committing a murder!

1124
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,780
Oh my god!

1125
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:32,760
I fucking died!

1126
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:33,620
What are you saying?

1127
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:35,360
You!

1128
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:35,580
You!

1129
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:36,380
You!

1130
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:38,280
You said you had a buckle before!

1131
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:38,700
You!

1132
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:42,680
You, you're like grabbing me by the neck!

1133
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:43,680
You!

1134
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:46,600
You!

1135
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:48,200
You!

1136
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:50,840
You!

1137
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:50,860
You!

1138
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:54,700
Oh, you're lucky I didn't have the mod where I can grab people!

1139
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:55,960
Oh my god!

1140
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:56,840
You're so lucky!

1141
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:58,920
I didn't download that mod!

1142
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,460
Oh my god!

1143
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:02,660
I have a rope!

1144
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,660
What is this?

1145
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:05,640
Oh, I thought you had that!

1146
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,340
I'm gonna tie you up!

1147
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:09,520
You're gonna do it!

1148
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:09,680
I'm gonna do it!

1149
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:09,960
Oh my god!

1150
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:09,980
Ow!

1151
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:13,020
She's all dying to me!

1152
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:14,580
That's right!

1153
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,220
That's right!

1154
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:17,320
That's right!

1155
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:17,580
That's right!

1156
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,160
That's right!

1157
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:22,400
We're not gonna get out of this island alive!

1158
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,640
I will be the boy who lives!

1159
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:27,440
I gotta make a run for it!

1160
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:30,240
I don't- Alright, that's right!

1161
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,840
Get up there you fucking coward!

1162
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:32,460
Run!

1163
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:36,420
I don't wanna have to help you but- We have to do it together!

1164
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,400
Are we leaving Mint?

1165
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:38,880
Are we?

1166
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,460
I think you need help!

1167
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:43,120
Um...

1168
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,260
Okay, okay.

1169
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:45,180
Um...

1170
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:48,280
This- This is not gonna- I don't think I can make it.

1171
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:48,480
Alright!

1172
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:48,980
Don't worry!

1173
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:49,580
Help me!

1174
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:50,800
Wait, Mint!

1175
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,660
I told you I'd help!

1176
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:56,360
Wait, what happened to Lime?

1177
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,120
Lime never made it!

1178
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,860
I think she ditched us!

1179
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:00,240
Lime is here!

1180
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:02,080
I think she ditched us!

1181
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,320
I think she's gone, guys!

1182
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,200
Lime would never- She's our tour guide!

1183
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:07,400
She's gone, guys!

1184
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:08,380
I'm waiting for you!

1185
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:09,480
Where the fuck did you go?

1186
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:10,800
Wait, what do you mean waiting?

1187
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,060
I think we're above you!

1188
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,400
Yeah, we're above you!

1189
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:14,780
No, I'm not!

1190
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:15,240
No!

1191
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:16,260
Hahaha!

1192
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,060
Let's go to this bridge!

1193
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,720
Let's go here!

1194
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:22,360
Right here!

1195
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:24,620
Wait, it's getting kinda foggy, no?

1196
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:28,120
Yeah, but it's cause like- It's getting a little dark over here!

1197
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:31,140
Yeah, this area is very, very foggy!

1198
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:32,300
No, I think it's fine!

1199
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:33,520
This seems very safe!

1200
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,380
I'm gonna go up!

1201
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:37,720
If you're happy and you know what, clap your hands!

1202
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,540
I think I can see the bridge and you're going towards the edge of the map!

1203
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:41,460
Oh!

1204
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:42,040
Oh!

1205
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:42,720
Is that bad?

1206
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,860
Um, I'm gonna go on the bridge!

1207
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:46,140
Ow!

1208
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:48,800
Okay, I'm on the bridge!

1209
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:49,940
Okay!

1210
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:50,980
I'm going this way!

1211
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,280
Oh, this way!

1212
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,100
Oh, there's like another bridge!

1213
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:53,840
Oh, I see you!

1214
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:54,680
I see you!

1215
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:55,360
Oh!

1216
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:56,460
Hello!

1217
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:58,160
Oh, I'm climbing on this bridge too!

1218
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:02,660
I'm already gone!

1219
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:03,320
Alright!

1220
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,080
I'm heading up as well!

1221
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,800
Wait, why am I not recovering stamina?

1222
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:07,460
Up here!

1223
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:08,820
Wait, there it is!

1224
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:11,140
Sometimes you gotta shimmy a little bit so I can figure it out!

1225
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:11,240
Stop!

1226
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:11,460
I'm trying to recover stamina!

1227
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:12,140
Come over this way!

1228
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,140
I gotta hand up for you!

1229
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:16,940
Oh, the fog is coming!

1230
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,040
Snuffy, you coming?

1231
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,380
It's really, it's really bad!

1232
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:24,520
Don't worry!

1233
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,320
Take my hand!

1234
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:25,780
Yay!

1235
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,340
Okay, or not!

1236
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:27,760
Fine!

1237
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,920
I literally took your hand!

1238
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,220
Where's Snuffy?

1239
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:31,960
Oh, jeez!

1240
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:35,320
Take my hand!

1241
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:42,160
You yell, take my hand, and then take your hand away?

1242
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,460
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1243
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,280
That's why I'm...

1244
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:51,180
That's why I'm going to the timeout corner in the voice.

1245
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:51,600
Oh, nice!

1246
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:51,620
Oh, nice!

1247
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:51,960
It's so clear!

1248
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:58,880
Channeling, like, the middle-aged uncle at the family gathering that keeps, like, being, like, you got something on your shirt!

1249
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:05,640
I'm the Boy Scout where the parents were like, this...

1250
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:09,120
Join the Boy Scout would definitely change her behavior for the better, right?

1251
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:09,760
No!

1252
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:16,760
They're like, instead of sending her to Juvie, we could just send her to the Boy Scouts.

1253
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,480
Wait, how do we do this?

1254
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:20,700
I'm gonna fall here.

1255
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:21,480
Just jump!

1256
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:22,700
It's a leap of faith!

1257
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:23,760
Oh, I believe!

1258
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,300
Okay, I'm coming!

1259
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:26,340
I'm coming!

1260
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:27,480
Oh, I'm coming!

1261
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:28,480
I'm coming!

1262
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:28,700
I'm coming, too!

1263
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:29,360
I got a hand up!

1264
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:30,500
You can do it!

1265
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,980
I did it!

1266
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:32,820
I did it!

1267
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:33,820
We did it!

1268
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:36,160
I'm so heavy!

1269
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,440
I'm so heavy!

1270
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,540
I'm so heavy!

1271
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:38,900
I'm sorry!

1272
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:41,300
Wait, you have food and you share it with the class?

1273
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:42,240
I'm starving!

1274
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,160
Oh, me too!

1275
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:44,220
Oh, me too!

1276
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:48,260
Wait, oh, I just ate something bad?

1277
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:48,920
Oh, I'm dying.

1278
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:50,120
Oh, it was poisonous.

1279
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:50,520
You'll be fine.

1280
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,120
That's not true.

1281
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:51,440
That's not true.

1282
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:51,700
It's a temporary death.

1283
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:52,540
Okay.

1284
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:53,020
You look fine.

1285
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:54,180
Nice.

1286
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:55,620
I like temporary deaths.

1287
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:57,000
I feel...

1288
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:57,800
I feel pale.

1289
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,580
Maybe you're taking...

1290
00:37:59,580 --> 00:37:59,980
You're great.

1291
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:00,640
You're okay.

1292
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:02,360
Oh, there's a suitcase!

1293
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:02,440
There is!

1294
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:02,860
Yeah!

1295
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,780
Don't eat those berries!

1296
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,960
There's a flying rock in the sky.

1297
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,060
Wait, there's a coconut!

1298
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:08,840
There's a coconut!

1299
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:10,340
That's known as the sun.

1300
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:13,260
There's a coconut!

1301
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:16,560
Alright, someone else climbed this tree.

1302
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,200
Cause I know I'm not good at that.

1303
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:22,580
Okay, if you climb it, you can throw the coconut at everybody.

1304
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:23,460
Oh, that's true!

1305
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:24,980
Yep.

1306
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:26,620
I gotta give her a hand.

1307
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,760
You can give me some of this first and then jump onto the tree.

1308
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:29,780
Oh!

1309
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:30,420
Yeah, yeah.

1310
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:31,300
Okay, okay.

1311
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,100
Who's gonna caught me?

1312
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:33,060
Who's gonna catch me, though?

1313
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,640
Just don't land on the giant spikes.

1314
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,080
Who's gonna catch me?

1315
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:37,280
Yeah, catching is definitely a thing that I can do.

1316
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:38,200
Okay.

1317
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:39,740
Watch this.

1318
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:41,920
Oh!

1319
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:42,680
Oh?

1320
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,000
You got this, bro.

1321
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:44,580
You got this.

1322
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:46,300
Knock him down.

1323
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:46,740
Knock him down.

1324
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:47,100
Yes!

1325
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:47,940
Got one.

1326
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:51,460
I did it, though.

1327
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:52,660
I did it.

1328
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:53,900
I...

1329
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:55,480
I did it, though.

1330
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,060
Wait, you guys ate the coconut!

1331
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,500
We're making it!

1332
00:38:59,560 --> 00:38:59,920
We're making it!

1333
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:00,820
I'll get another one.

1334
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:01,800
I can see the top!

1335
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:02,140
I was really angry.

1336
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:03,400
You can already!

1337
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,220
Where is it?

1338
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:05,180
There's smoke!

1339
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:06,720
It's endgame!

1340
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:07,440
We're definitely the endgame!

1341
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,760
Oh my god, we're gonna beat the game!

1342
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,580
We're gonna commit a new world record right here.

1343
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:13,900
Oh, there's...

1344
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:14,980
There's apples!

1345
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:16,600
There's lots of food there.

1346
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,860
How did a dead jellyfish get all the way up here?

1347
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:19,820
What the fuck?

1348
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:22,440
I don't know if those mushrooms are okay.

1349
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,960
Is the tide really that crazy?

1350
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:26,020
Wait, I'm hungry!

1351
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:27,720
I'm hungry, too!

1352
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:28,660
I'm hungry, too!

1353
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:29,260
I'm hungry, too, but fine!

1354
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:30,660
Eat your fuckin' mushroom.

1355
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,160
Uh, Crisberry, whatever it is.

1356
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:33,460
Hey, I climbed that tree for us.

1357
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:34,500
I'm gonna have a marshmallow.

1358
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:37,400
Oh my god, we are getting mushrooms...

1359
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:37,980
marshmallows.

1360
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:39,980
Yeah, marsh mushrooms.

1361
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:40,940
Marsh mushrooms.

1362
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,060
I don't even know which one you're talking about.

1363
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:43,520
Oh, it's not fine, actually.

1364
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:44,920
I'm so fine.

1365
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,100
No, I was okay.

1366
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,800
You can eat one, but you definitely can eat two!

1367
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:52,600
Oh, wow!

1368
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:54,180
I'm really taking a lot of damage.

1369
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:56,000
Wait, wait, I got this.

1370
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:56,540
Yay!

1371
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:59,180
Wait, I'm taking like a lot of...

1372
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:01,720
Don't worry, I'll be fine!

1373
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:02,940
If you...

1374
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:04,940
Oh, wait, wait, you can die, so...

1375
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:06,780
Mint, if you die, we can rez you!

1376
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:07,520
Where's Snuffy?

1377
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:08,520
Where's Snuffy?

1378
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:09,240
Oh, where is Snuffy?

1379
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:12,640
Help me!

1380
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:13,620
Snuffy!

1381
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:14,100
Help me!

1382
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:14,180
Yay!

1383
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,320
Oh, there she is!

1384
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:18,220
Where the fuck are you all the way over there?

1385
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:19,460
Well, how did she get there?

1386
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:20,860
Look at her, she's right over here.

1387
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:23,700
She's like right over here.

1388
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:30,240
Uh, Doki, can you take Min?

1389
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:31,380
I can't take her in the backpack.

1390
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:32,340
Sure.

1391
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:36,140
Uh, you wanna do it quick, otherwise she'll collapse and die.

1392
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,980
I don't sense your urgency here.

1393
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:43,080
That's fucked up.

1394
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:44,320
That's fucked up, Doki.

1395
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:45,760
That's yours fucked up.

1396
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:51,040
Don't worry, Snuffy will bring her back up.

1397
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:59,220
It's just awful.

1398
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:11,180
Wait, how is she gonna come back alive?

1399
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:14,200
Um, we need like health.

1400
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:15,980
Oh, so she'll be...

1401
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:16,980
So where did Snuffy go?

1402
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:17,640
Hell no.

1403
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:18,460
Snuffy!

1404
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:21,480
Isn't it res...

1405
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,600
Can you take the backpack here?

1406
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:23,840
Yeah, I can carry it.

1407
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:24,720
How do you carry it?

1408
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:25,360
Oh!

1409
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:25,920
Oh!

1410
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:26,080
She's back!

1411
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:26,660
You're alive!

1412
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:26,740
Nevermind!

1413
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:27,140
She said it!

1414
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:27,940
I told you, she's alive!

1415
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:28,660
Welcome back!

1416
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:30,140
What happened to me?

1417
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:31,540
I'm a little blue.

1418
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:31,620
I'm a little blue.

1419
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:34,260
I have no stamina.

1420
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:35,440
All poison, baby.

1421
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,020
Here's your bugle.

1422
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:37,240
Thank you!

1423
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,240
You might have taken too many poison.

1424
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:39,680
You're welcome.

1425
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,140
If you play that, something good might happen.

1426
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:44,620
Snuffy!

1427
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,000
And

1428
00:41:53,990 --> 00:41:57,610
then all the way over there, and then all the way over there, and never reach here.

1429
00:41:57,870 --> 00:41:58,770
Oh, that's actually impressive.

1430
00:41:59,170 --> 00:42:01,750
It's like the 20th century fox sounds.

1431
00:42:02,330 --> 00:42:04,470
Oh, Mint kinda died, so I had to pick Mint up.

1432
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:05,890
She looks good to me.

1433
00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:06,950
I definitely died.

1434
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:08,230
She temporarily died.

1435
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:10,290
Yeah, she's building her poison resistance.

1436
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:11,870
I have no stamina.

1437
00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:12,750
Oh, nice!

1438
00:42:12,870 --> 00:42:13,550
We got marshmallow!

1439
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:17,570
Hey, there's another backpack!

1440
00:42:18,210 --> 00:42:20,010
Wait, how do I wear this backpack?

1441
00:42:20,090 --> 00:42:20,550
Oh, there you go.

1442
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:25,890
Okay, wait.

1443
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:27,410
I can put stuff here, too.

1444
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:28,370
Whoa!

1445
00:42:28,770 --> 00:42:29,890
There's some marshmallows!

1446
00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:30,890
Yeah!

1447
00:42:31,890 --> 00:42:33,550
Oh, is this our wilds?

1448
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:36,650
Yeah, can...

1449
00:42:36,650 --> 00:42:38,330
Snuffy, can you use a chain launcher?

1450
00:42:38,830 --> 00:42:39,070
Whoa!

1451
00:42:39,570 --> 00:42:40,830
Does anybody want to eat mushrooms?

1452
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:42,490
No, that's not a mushroom.

1453
00:42:42,490 --> 00:42:42,710
No, it's fine.

1454
00:42:42,850 --> 00:42:43,770
I have a marshmallow.

1455
00:42:44,290 --> 00:42:44,930
Oh, I thought it was wrong.

1456
00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:45,750
Oh, day four!

1457
00:42:46,050 --> 00:42:46,850
We made it!

1458
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:49,110
Nice!

1459
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:50,070
Wait, what's this?

1460
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:51,470
There's a little man up here.

1461
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:52,690
Wait, there's a chain launcher.

1462
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:55,410
What's a chain launcher?

1463
00:42:58,210 --> 00:42:59,070
Launching a chain?

1464
00:42:59,370 --> 00:42:59,450
Bad news!

1465
00:43:00,030 --> 00:43:04,970
The ship captain made an oopsie, and we've wound up crashing on this mysterious island.

1466
00:43:04,970 --> 00:43:07,850
Thankfully, mysterious islands are my specialty.

1467
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:13,490
With our whole troop working together, we'll reach the top of the peak, and signal for heaven at no time.

1468
00:43:13,850 --> 00:43:20,430
In the meantime, I'll take this opportunity to add some additional pages to my famous guidebook, Scoutmaster Myers.

1469
00:43:20,950 --> 00:43:21,250
Whoa!

1470
00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:24,630
Scoutmaster Myers must have definitely lived, right?

1471
00:43:24,910 --> 00:43:26,430
I'm gonna touch the ancient statue.

1472
00:43:26,430 --> 00:43:27,270
I thought...

1473
00:43:27,270 --> 00:43:29,850
I thought you were the Scoutmaster.

1474
00:43:30,130 --> 00:43:32,650
Wait, what does it do if we touch the ancient statue?

1475
00:43:34,370 --> 00:43:34,890
That's a different Scoutmaster.

1476
00:43:34,890 --> 00:43:35,250
I think he fragments.

1477
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:35,850
I think he fragments.

1478
00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:37,270
Oh!

1479
00:43:39,430 --> 00:43:41,830
And it makes a horcrux, right?

1480
00:43:42,330 --> 00:43:43,090
I'm touching you.

1481
00:43:43,890 --> 00:43:44,010
Oh!

1482
00:43:47,910 --> 00:43:48,430
Oh!

1483
00:43:48,810 --> 00:43:49,030
Oh!

1484
00:43:50,030 --> 00:43:51,310
It's a revive thing, right?

1485
00:43:51,870 --> 00:43:52,870
It heals you.

1486
00:43:53,170 --> 00:43:54,110
Is anyone damaged?

1487
00:43:54,110 --> 00:43:54,630
Oh!

1488
00:43:54,850 --> 00:43:55,290
Oh!

1489
00:43:55,410 --> 00:43:56,090
No, I'm okay.

1490
00:43:57,370 --> 00:43:57,810
I have poison.

1491
00:43:57,830 --> 00:43:58,270
Poison?

1492
00:43:58,390 --> 00:43:59,430
I don't know if it heals poison.

1493
00:44:00,990 --> 00:44:03,010
Wait, how come I have so much energy?

1494
00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:03,490
Yeah!

1495
00:44:03,870 --> 00:44:05,410
What is my electricity bar?

1496
00:44:07,050 --> 00:44:08,310
That's your extra stamina.

1497
00:44:08,970 --> 00:44:09,510
Oh, I have extra...

1498
00:44:09,510 --> 00:44:11,030
Okay, who fucking fed me a mushroom?

1499
00:44:11,310 --> 00:44:12,170
Who fucking fed me a...

1500
00:44:12,170 --> 00:44:12,770
Who fucking fed me a...

1501
00:44:12,770 --> 00:44:14,510
No, someone fed me the mushroom.

1502
00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:15,210
Who was it?

1503
00:44:15,370 --> 00:44:16,290
Who fucking...

1504
00:44:16,910 --> 00:44:18,570
Who gave me the mushroom?

1505
00:44:18,890 --> 00:44:20,210
It was you, wasn't it?

1506
00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:21,290
I know it was you!

1507
00:44:21,290 --> 00:44:23,270
I know it was you!

1508
00:44:23,770 --> 00:44:24,950
I know it was you!

1509
00:44:24,950 --> 00:44:26,170
I will have the good mushroom, I promise!

1510
00:44:26,970 --> 00:44:27,450
I promise!

1511
00:44:27,730 --> 00:44:29,390
I know it was you!

1512
00:44:29,390 --> 00:44:31,630
I will brush you off!

1513
00:44:31,930 --> 00:44:33,690
Off getting you to the cliff!

1514
00:44:34,370 --> 00:44:34,650
No!

1515
00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:35,430
No!

1516
00:44:36,290 --> 00:44:38,690
Wait, you're also taking damage, Nubby.

1517
00:44:38,790 --> 00:44:39,810
Did you eat the mushroom, too?

1518
00:44:40,910 --> 00:44:43,630
I think Nubby is eating poisonous mushrooms from the sun.

1519
00:44:44,010 --> 00:44:44,330
I don't know.

1520
00:44:44,330 --> 00:44:45,290
I said it to everybody!

1521
00:44:45,790 --> 00:44:49,010
She's trying to be so helpful in just poisoning her friends.

1522
00:44:49,010 --> 00:44:50,890
She's trying to find me earlier!

1523
00:44:51,310 --> 00:44:52,470
Okay, all in favor!

1524
00:44:52,730 --> 00:44:53,410
All in favor!

1525
00:44:53,410 --> 00:44:54,630
All in favor voting Stuffy!

1526
00:44:55,110 --> 00:44:55,230
Aye!

1527
00:44:55,830 --> 00:44:56,210
Aye!

1528
00:44:56,670 --> 00:44:57,090
Aye!

1529
00:44:58,470 --> 00:44:58,550
Aye!

1530
00:44:59,690 --> 00:45:02,170
We vote Stuffy off the island!

1531
00:45:03,070 --> 00:45:06,190
Take your tiki torch and leave the island, Stuffy!

1532
00:45:06,410 --> 00:45:07,830
If that's what you want, I'll just jump!

1533
00:45:08,010 --> 00:45:08,410
Do it!

1534
00:45:08,410 --> 00:45:09,430
It'll get so cool!

1535
00:45:09,570 --> 00:45:10,430
Do a flip, too!

1536
00:45:10,790 --> 00:45:11,190
Do it!

1537
00:45:11,650 --> 00:45:12,110
Do it!

1538
00:45:13,930 --> 00:45:14,770
That's right!

1539
00:45:14,770 --> 00:45:15,030
Do it!

1540
00:45:17,810 --> 00:45:19,030
Did she jump!

1541
00:45:19,530 --> 00:45:20,190
That's right!

1542
00:45:20,270 --> 00:45:21,110
What did you do?

1543
00:45:21,150 --> 00:45:22,290
I did- yeah!

1544
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:22,950
That's right!

1545
00:45:24,690 --> 00:45:26,010
It's what she deserved.

1546
00:45:28,830 --> 00:45:29,350
Oh, sir!

1547
00:45:29,350 --> 00:45:29,650
Oh, shit!

1548
00:45:29,830 --> 00:45:29,930
Wait where is she?

1549
00:45:30,010 --> 00:45:30,330
Is she down?

1550
00:45:31,430 --> 00:45:32,190
Oh, my God!

1551
00:45:32,290 --> 00:45:33,750
My monitor died, so I thought I died!

1552
00:45:35,310 --> 00:45:36,330
No, she's down there?

1553
00:45:36,670 --> 00:45:37,430
Well, she's alive!

1554
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:38,170
He's alive!

1555
00:45:43,670 --> 00:45:44,550
She's alive!

1556
00:45:44,550 --> 00:45:45,430
I was like, whoa.

1557
00:45:47,130 --> 00:45:48,230
Caring at the wall.

1558
00:45:48,830 --> 00:45:50,750
Yeah, in the corner.

1559
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:54,890
You guys are going crazy, but I'm like cabin in the woods level snapping.

1560
00:45:57,130 --> 00:45:59,010
What do we grab onto here?

1561
00:45:59,230 --> 00:45:59,590
I'm scared.

1562
00:46:00,010 --> 00:46:07,690
Okay, so when there's a little bit of a drop, you can actually turn and face the wall and like just grab it in increments when you're dropping down to stop your fall.

1563
00:46:07,690 --> 00:46:09,310
I have a magic bean, is it good?

1564
00:46:10,730 --> 00:46:12,090
Oh my god, why not magic?

1565
00:46:12,090 --> 00:46:12,710
Yeah.

1566
00:46:13,030 --> 00:46:15,490
Tell me more about your magic bean, Dougie.

1567
00:46:15,490 --> 00:46:15,890
Don't feed it to me.

1568
00:46:15,950 --> 00:46:18,070
The beans, the fruit that makes you toot.

1569
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:19,890
How do you give it to people?

1570
00:46:20,090 --> 00:46:21,670
There's like a whole children's rhyme about magic beans.

1571
00:46:21,670 --> 00:46:24,310
Wait, I can't do anything with this magic bean.

1572
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:25,470
It just says it's magic.

1573
00:46:26,830 --> 00:46:27,590
I'll plant it.

1574
00:46:28,610 --> 00:46:29,950
Oh, I can plant it?

1575
00:46:30,050 --> 00:46:32,450
Okay, we gotta find a place for me to plant this magic bean.

1576
00:46:32,590 --> 00:46:34,990
Why does the magic bean have to do anything for you?

1577
00:46:35,170 --> 00:46:36,230
Do you hate whimsy?

1578
00:46:36,450 --> 00:46:37,490
Perhaps it's just magical.

1579
00:46:38,350 --> 00:46:38,510
Oh!

1580
00:46:38,510 --> 00:46:38,550
Oh!

1581
00:46:38,750 --> 00:46:39,230
Oh!

1582
00:46:40,810 --> 00:46:41,290
Oh!

1583
00:46:42,450 --> 00:46:43,350
I made that.

1584
00:46:43,630 --> 00:46:44,510
I'm a father.

1585
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:45,290
Dude.

1586
00:46:45,830 --> 00:46:46,450
Oh, I get it.

1587
00:46:46,890 --> 00:46:47,490
Oh, it's like...

1588
00:46:47,490 --> 00:46:47,990
Yeah.

1589
00:46:48,390 --> 00:46:49,370
James and the giant...

1590
00:46:49,370 --> 00:46:49,870
Yeah!

1591
00:46:50,270 --> 00:46:52,270
Okay, maybe I should've saved the...

1592
00:46:52,270 --> 00:46:53,250
James and the giant fucking drill.

1593
00:46:53,610 --> 00:46:55,370
I should've saved that magic bean.

1594
00:46:55,630 --> 00:46:57,310
Wait, there's a red suitcase over there.

1595
00:46:57,410 --> 00:46:58,290
I'm going for it.

1596
00:46:58,310 --> 00:46:59,190
Yeah, I see it.

1597
00:46:59,430 --> 00:47:01,210
Wait, are we supposed to keep going up again?

1598
00:47:01,210 --> 00:47:02,210
Red means good.

1599
00:47:02,550 --> 00:47:03,610
Yeah, we're going up there.

1600
00:47:03,610 --> 00:47:05,050
Wait, give me a sec.

1601
00:47:05,190 --> 00:47:06,330
I'm going for the red.

1602
00:47:06,450 --> 00:47:07,870
I don't trust you with mushrooms.

1603
00:47:08,190 --> 00:47:08,210
Ah!

1604
00:47:08,690 --> 00:47:09,930
Red means good.

1605
00:47:11,770 --> 00:47:13,390
This seems like a good berry.

1606
00:47:15,670 --> 00:47:16,170
Alright.

1607
00:47:16,950 --> 00:47:18,210
I'm opening it.

1608
00:47:19,350 --> 00:47:20,970
Oh my god, I got airplane food.

1609
00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:21,990
It is good.

1610
00:47:22,530 --> 00:47:23,050
Nice.

1611
00:47:24,030 --> 00:47:25,930
I told you, red is good.

1612
00:47:26,810 --> 00:47:28,470
Hey, where are you guys going?

1613
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:29,570
Where are you guys?

1614
00:47:33,390 --> 00:47:33,910
Hello?

1615
00:47:37,250 --> 00:47:38,770
Oh my god, hello?

1616
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:43,440
Hello?

1617
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:45,120
Look at me go!

1618
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:47,280
Ooh, ooh, ah, ah!

1619
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:50,220
Oh my god!

1620
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:51,300
Did you guys see...

1621
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:52,340
Oh my god, there's a banana!

1622
00:47:52,340 --> 00:47:56,360
Oh, there's some good apples over here.

1623
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:57,780
There's so many bananas!

1624
00:47:58,460 --> 00:47:59,400
Are you sure they're good?

1625
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:01,140
Are you sure they're good?

1626
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:01,340
Are you sure?

1627
00:48:01,340 --> 00:48:02,760
Yeah, I ate one of those apples.

1628
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:03,560
They're pretty good.

1629
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:04,140
Are you okay?

1630
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:05,220
I...

1631
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:05,840
I did...

1632
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:08,540
I did not realize that that's what that was.

1633
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:09,500
What is this?

1634
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:09,780
I didn't stop.

1635
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:11,260
I don't know.

1636
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:12,520
I was wondering if you could eat it.

1637
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:12,800
Good.

1638
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:14,920
I just had to drop it on the floor and it like...

1639
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:16,440
got really big.

1640
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:17,160
Well, I just went...

1641
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:18,300
Snuffy, get up here.

1642
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:19,360
Cool.

1643
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:21,580
Oh, what the...

1644
00:48:21,580 --> 00:48:22,920
I'm getting the apples.

1645
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:24,860
Snuffy, get up here.

1646
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:26,180
I'm coming.

1647
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:31,080
Where are you guys?

1648
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:32,140
I'm ready up here.

1649
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:33,160
I got it.

1650
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:35,700
You just belly flopped your way up there.

1651
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:36,160
That was cool.

1652
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:38,160
Oh, it's a platform?

1653
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:39,280
Oh, it's a foot.

1654
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:43,660
I have a shell fungus.

1655
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,300
Apparently, it's an extra platform.

1656
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:46,340
Like the magic bean.

1657
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:48,420
Bananas!

1658
00:48:48,940 --> 00:48:49,980
Is anybody hungry?

1659
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,120
I don't think...

1660
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:52,080
Only a little bit.

1661
00:48:52,460 --> 00:48:53,120
I have this.

1662
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,200
Can you touch me with a ripe apple?

1663
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:57,780
Can we touch the spikes or...

1664
00:48:57,780 --> 00:48:57,940
I think I did.

1665
00:48:57,940 --> 00:48:58,160
I did.

1666
00:48:58,160 --> 00:48:58,420
Oh, cool.

1667
00:48:58,660 --> 00:48:59,300
No, you can't.

1668
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:00,360
They're similar.

1669
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:01,180
They are...

1670
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:02,740
Hey guys, I did a swing.

1671
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:05,100
We have a little place to sit now.

1672
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:05,980
Yeah.

1673
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:08,420
Why are you always poisoned mints?

1674
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:09,700
I'm putting these in your mouth.

1675
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:10,520
Stop eating!

1676
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:11,780
I'm like a baby!

1677
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:12,560
Can I eat a banana?

1678
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:13,600
My new son.

1679
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:18,860
I'm so helpful.

1680
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:21,380
Do you think these bananas are safe?

1681
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:22,500
Yeah, I ate one.

1682
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:23,080
Yeah, they're bananas.

1683
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:23,760
They have to eat.

1684
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:24,160
Yeah.

1685
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:27,940
It's weird that there's no more monkeys on this island.

1686
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:30,000
But I think it's not because of the bananas.

1687
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:34,820
Can't be.

1688
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:36,240
This one is actually safe.

1689
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:36,780
Here you go.

1690
00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:39,600
It made me hungry.

1691
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:41,420
Oh, I'm up here now.

1692
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:44,160
I have no idea.

1693
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:46,140
Take my hand!

1694
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:49,160
Take my hand!

1695
00:49:50,540 --> 00:49:51,100
Yoinked.

1696
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:51,940
Thank you.

1697
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:52,960
Too slow.

1698
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:55,640
How did Mint get all the way over there?

1699
00:49:55,940 --> 00:49:57,560
She just walked, I'm pretty sure.

1700
00:49:59,180 --> 00:50:00,280
Wait, where is she?

1701
00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:00,420
She walked?

1702
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:01,880
I wanna drop the filthy up this mountain.

1703
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:02,480
She just walked.

1704
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:04,640
We would all clap.

1705
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:07,460
Mint, don't worry!

1706
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:09,200
I've gotten my hand out.

1707
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:11,040
Wait, what's this?

1708
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:11,720
Don't lie!

1709
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:12,780
Don't lie!

1710
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:15,060
Scout members, be careful!

1711
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:17,820
I know what you did, Snuffy.

1712
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:20,100
Keep one eye open tonight.

1713
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:21,140
Watch out for the spikes!

1714
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:24,080
The rain makes it harder to climb.

1715
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:25,180
Wait, really?

1716
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:26,800
No, it doesn't.

1717
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:27,780
You're lying.

1718
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:28,620
Look at me go.

1719
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:30,220
Look at me go.

1720
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:30,980
I'm climbing.

1721
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:31,960
I wanna try a banana.

1722
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:33,720
Alright, fine.

1723
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:34,560
Climb in the rain.

1724
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:35,880
See what I care.

1725
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:36,740
Banana?

1726
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:41,740
Wow, I can't believe we came from all the way over there.

1727
00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:42,360
I know, right?

1728
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:43,300
We did that.

1729
00:50:43,620 --> 00:50:44,500
We've grown so much.

1730
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:45,540
We're climbing the sea.

1731
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:46,100
I know!

1732
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:49,700
Oh my god, if only our scoutmaster could see us now.

1733
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:50,780
Yeah.

1734
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:57,420
I'm climbing up.

1735
00:50:57,840 --> 00:50:57,960
We got you.

1736
00:50:59,620 --> 00:51:01,980
I thought this game was supposed to be scary.

1737
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:03,840
Guys, I'm getting poisoned.

1738
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:05,280
How am I...

1739
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:06,100
Oh, it's these.

1740
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:06,940
Don't touch these.

1741
00:51:07,420 --> 00:51:07,460
Thank you!

1742
00:51:07,460 --> 00:51:07,780
Don't touch the poison ivy!

1743
00:51:07,860 --> 00:51:09,500
Don't touch poison ivy, guys.

1744
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:11,220
Scouting one on one, man.

1745
00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:11,620
The fog rises.

1746
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:13,740
How was I supposed to know?

1747
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:14,860
Purple is bad.

1748
00:51:15,860 --> 00:51:17,060
That's the only reason why I haven't done it.

1749
00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:19,360
I think that's for personal respect.

1750
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:21,580
Which way could we go?

1751
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:23,500
Where did Dokino?

1752
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:24,700
I'm up.

1753
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:28,140
You guys should have followed me.

1754
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:29,480
Oh, beautiful.

1755
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:29,580
Purple.

1756
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:34,660
Guys, guys, guys, guys!

1757
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:37,900
Don't follow me, guys.

1758
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:39,280
I broke my leg.

1759
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:41,640
Guys, don't follow me.

1760
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:43,880
I broke my leg.

1761
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:44,760
No.

1762
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:46,020
I have a banana peel now.

1763
00:51:46,180 --> 00:51:46,220
Wait.

1764
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:46,980
I fucked up.

1765
00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:47,960
Watch her flip on it.

1766
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:50,460
How do I drop it?

1767
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:51,080
Oh, here we go.

1768
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:53,080
You're...

1769
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:54,060
Hey, take a step forward.

1770
00:51:54,460 --> 00:51:55,160
Oh, shit!

1771
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:56,140
I got poisoned ivy.

1772
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:07,180
I fell down.

1773
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:10,780
I think we gotta maneuver our way through here.

1774
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:12,980
This one's okay.

1775
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:14,920
I don't know if you can, actually.

1776
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:15,620
Don't touch me.

1777
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:16,000
Don't stop.

1778
00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:17,120
I'm feeling pressure.

1779
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:17,680
Stop.

1780
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:18,200
Stop.

1781
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:27,220
Oh, wait.

1782
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:31,400
Yeah, that rate actually worked, but, like, I fucked it up.

1783
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:33,580
And then I broke my leg again.

1784
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:35,300
I broke my leg again.

1785
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:36,500
Go back the way you went.

1786
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:37,340
This way here.

1787
00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:37,660
Yeah.

1788
00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:39,820
And then you can walk most of the way along here when it's not raining.

1789
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:43,300
Not the rain.

1790
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:45,340
How do I take it?

1791
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:47,280
How do I take your apple?

1792
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:48,780
What?

1793
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:50,200
Take it.

1794
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:51,960
Oh, another what?

1795
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:53,340
Yeah.

1796
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:56,240
Kind of shove yourself with the right side, so you...

1797
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:56,840
Not when it's raining.

1798
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:58,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you can...

1799
00:52:58,340 --> 00:52:58,760
Oh god!

1800
00:52:59,200 --> 00:52:59,920
I'm okay.

1801
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:01,940
Wait.

1802
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:03,360
I'm getting poisoned.

1803
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:04,100
Me too.

1804
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:08,020
Why don't you set off a giant poison explosive cloud?

1805
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:09,960
I don't have much.

1806
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:10,880
You're poisoned.

1807
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:11,880
I got you.

1808
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:12,140
I got you.

1809
00:53:12,180 --> 00:53:12,740
No!

1810
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:13,340
No!

1811
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:14,340
You did that!

1812
00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:15,400
Help me!

1813
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:16,320
Help me!

1814
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:17,800
Help me!

1815
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:22,980
I don't think you helped her.

1816
00:53:23,260 --> 00:53:24,080
Is she okay?

1817
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:30,900
I think she's okay, guys.

1818
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:33,100
You won't be hearing, like, actual screams.

1819
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:36,840
Guys, does anyone have meds?

1820
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:40,380
I think I broke more than two meds.

1821
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:43,080
Oh, I have this.

1822
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:44,120
I got you.

1823
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:47,840
Wait for Doki.

1824
00:53:47,980 --> 00:53:48,640
She needs it, too.

1825
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:49,900
I think she used it.

1826
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:51,220
No, I don't think I will.

1827
00:53:51,660 --> 00:53:52,160
Okay.

1828
00:53:52,660 --> 00:53:54,420
Stop hitting me, spread of shit!

1829
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:56,700
Stop hitting me, spread of shit!

1830
00:53:57,120 --> 00:53:57,960
Stop hitting me!

1831
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:00,840
Stop hitting me, spread of shit!

1832
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:02,280
I won't push your arm!

1833
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:02,840
I'll slow it!

1834
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:02,860
You're playing it!

1835
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:03,480
Try your timing.

1836
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:04,940
You know what you want to do?

1837
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:06,080
I won't!

1838
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:06,480
No!

1839
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:07,760
No!

1840
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:08,260
No!

1841
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:08,640
No!

1842
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:11,260
Okay, you're right.

1843
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:13,000
That's right.

1844
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:15,980
You deserve that snub!

1845
00:54:15,980 --> 00:54:21,440
I don't really know what to do.

1846
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:23,100
It's the king.

1847
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:25,420
Min, you can walk.

1848
00:54:25,620 --> 00:54:27,220
Just push yourself into the corner.

1849
00:54:27,460 --> 00:54:28,520
Walk along it.

1850
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:29,340
Okay.

1851
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:35,360
I swear you gotta be bringing that out one more time.

1852
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:36,780
And you bring it out.

1853
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:38,500
Help me.

1854
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,500
I made it so you can look at you.

1855
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:43,140
Can you bring up the fairy lantern now?

1856
00:54:43,660 --> 00:54:44,420
Holy shit.

1857
00:54:44,420 --> 00:54:45,760
Oh, it's empty.

1858
00:54:45,940 --> 00:54:46,860
Oh my god.

1859
00:54:51,180 --> 00:54:52,640
You fucking bitch.

1860
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:54,740
You fucking bitch.

1861
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:57,300
No, I'm gonna...

1862
00:54:57,300 --> 00:54:57,480
Whoa.

1863
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:01,000
It's actually gonna be.

1864
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:02,420
I'm gonna...

1865
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:05,620
I'm gonna...

1866
00:55:05,620 --> 00:55:10,460
I'm gonna bring you down a cliff.

1867
00:55:10,460 --> 00:55:12,280
A little pause.

1868
00:55:14,820 --> 00:55:17,060
Your dog says the violence.

1869
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:20,520
He took back to see us survive.

1870
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:22,140
Yes, let's see.

1871
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:24,600
I'm making an example out of you.

1872
00:55:27,580 --> 00:55:30,240
He knows what I wanted to do.

1873
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:36,600
Run.

1874
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:37,040
Run.

1875
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:37,680
Run.

1876
00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:38,280
Run.

1877
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:39,560
He wants food.

1878
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:40,440
He wants food.

1879
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:42,740
And I want food, too.

1880
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:46,880
Yeah, you have an apple in your backpack, okay?

1881
00:55:48,260 --> 00:55:49,620
That's not an apple.

1882
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:50,200
Wait, don't touch that.

1883
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:52,400
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1884
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:53,220
Yeah, don't touch that.

1885
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:54,040
What is that?

1886
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:54,640
What is that?

1887
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:55,220
Don't touch that.

1888
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:57,420
Maybe you should touch it and find out.

1889
00:55:57,680 --> 00:55:58,120
Or wait, wait.

1890
00:55:58,160 --> 00:55:59,620
I'll throw this, and it'll activate.

1891
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:03,960
Nice throw.

1892
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:04,320
Great.

1893
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:05,200
Good job.

1894
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:05,900
Good job.

1895
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:07,140
Don't worry.

1896
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:08,680
It's laying a pad.

1897
00:56:12,620 --> 00:56:14,860
I don't think- I hope we didn't need that.

1898
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:15,980
Yeah, me too.

1899
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:17,180
I hope so, too.

1900
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:20,820
I'm sure it just fell somewhere in this hole.

1901
00:56:21,820 --> 00:56:22,900
It'll be fine.

1902
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:24,240
I'm pretty sure.

1903
00:56:25,220 --> 00:56:25,720
Ow.

1904
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:28,900
Oh my god.

1905
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:29,600
This is a hole.

1906
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:30,860
You can make that jump, but it's far.

1907
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:32,360
Right here?

1908
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:34,060
From where I'm standing, or from there?

1909
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:36,640
From where you're standing, I think?

1910
00:56:36,940 --> 00:56:37,900
I think that's what I did.

1911
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:38,540
I got you.

1912
00:56:59,650 --> 00:57:01,750
I want to feed my dog.

1913
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:25,580
I think I'm dead.

1914
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:28,380
I think I am dead.

1915
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:31,580
Come on, pretty shit.

1916
00:57:35,940 --> 00:57:38,520
Oh, hey Doki, what's up?

1917
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:43,460
I shall haunt you for the crimes you've committed now.

1918
00:57:44,380 --> 00:57:45,780
The crime was lit!

1919
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:48,380
I had so many items!

1920
00:57:49,140 --> 00:57:50,680
I had so many!

1921
00:57:50,860 --> 00:57:51,960
I had a backpack!

1922
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:00,900
I'm here to haunt you.

1923
00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:06,140
I don't know if this is the better way to go.

1924
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:07,240
We should go that way.

1925
00:58:07,380 --> 00:58:07,540
What?

1926
00:58:07,940 --> 00:58:08,700
Wait, can I not?

1927
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:09,960
I trust you.

1928
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:12,320
Oh, don't do that.

1929
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:13,060
That's terrible.

1930
00:58:13,220 --> 00:58:16,020
Wait, how do we... How can I like free...

1931
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:17,360
Free haunt?

1932
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:19,260
I might like stuck 50.

1933
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:19,700
Free haunt?

1934
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:22,960
Yeah, so I can like... You can ask Mint how to start getting your haunting career.

1935
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:23,440
It's not.

1936
00:58:24,020 --> 00:58:26,040
Yeah, you have an expert right here.

1937
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:27,680
I can't tell if that's getting hit by the rain or not.

1938
00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:28,600
It's not.

1939
00:58:30,180 --> 00:58:30,620
Hmm...

1940
00:58:30,620 --> 00:58:31,900
You're just like Doki.

1941
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:33,300
Your face is so ugly.

1942
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:34,540
Wait, this is so scary though.

1943
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:40,280
Maybe... Mint could put her...

1944
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:43,320
Yeah, Mint could put her peton or something on...

1945
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:43,880
Her what?

1946
00:58:44,180 --> 00:58:44,520
Peton!

1947
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:45,660
I stole that from your back!

1948
00:58:45,660 --> 00:58:48,600
No, let me wait for the rain and I'll see if I can do it.

1949
00:58:48,660 --> 00:58:48,980
Hold on.

1950
00:58:49,260 --> 00:58:51,160
I got lots of extra stamina, so...

1951
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:52,260
I stole it!

1952
00:58:52,420 --> 00:58:53,320
And it actually worked!

1953
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:54,720
It worked out, cause I have it.

1954
00:58:54,980 --> 00:58:55,660
Oh, I can!

1955
00:58:55,860 --> 00:58:56,760
I can zoom out!

1956
00:58:57,460 --> 00:58:58,580
Oh, I see the top!

1957
00:59:00,820 --> 00:59:02,060
I see the top!

1958
00:59:02,540 --> 00:59:03,720
You're like almost there!

1959
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:04,100
What?

1960
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:06,820
I think that's the top.

1961
00:59:07,020 --> 00:59:07,540
Oh, thank you!

1962
00:59:07,780 --> 00:59:08,320
Whoa, whoa!

1963
00:59:09,060 --> 00:59:09,420
Whoa!

1964
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:10,360
Oh, there's some...

1965
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:11,480
There's some things here!

1966
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:12,060
What's these?

1967
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:12,660
There's some bees!

1968
00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:14,020
Oh, there's bees!

1969
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:15,280
Don't touch the bees!

1970
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:15,920
Touch the bees!

1971
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:16,960
Touch the bees!

1972
00:59:17,340 --> 00:59:18,580
Touch the bees!

1973
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:19,440
Touch the bees!

1974
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:20,520
Stuffy, touch the bee!

1975
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:21,740
Touch it!

1976
00:59:22,020 --> 00:59:24,080
Who wants to try the mouse?

1977
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:24,940
I'll take it!

1978
00:59:25,060 --> 00:59:25,460
I'll take it!

1979
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:26,060
I'll take it!

1980
00:59:26,060 --> 00:59:26,220
Here you go!

1981
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:28,760
Oh, that looks so poisonous there!

1982
00:59:29,580 --> 00:59:30,320
Oh no!

1983
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:32,620
It just looked like a cantaloupe!

1984
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:35,800
Wait, sound guys, the sound been okay?

1985
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:37,100
Ooh!

1986
00:59:38,860 --> 00:59:39,660
Rope cannon!

1987
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:40,720
Ooh!

1988
00:59:41,260 --> 00:59:41,820
And the water!

1989
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:42,700
Do you want any?

1990
00:59:42,940 --> 00:59:45,100
Oh my god, you guys are not close to the top!

1991
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:48,380
Actually, that fed me, like, I'm so full, just a little poison.

1992
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:50,380
That was actually the best thing I could've had!

1993
00:59:50,940 --> 00:59:51,120
Yeah!

1994
00:59:52,340 --> 00:59:53,560
Just walk it off!

1995
00:59:53,980 --> 00:59:56,060
The poison will eventually stop, you know?

1996
00:59:58,020 --> 01:00:01,700
It's like when you eat pineapple and it makes your mouth a little spiky, but it's still a little bit.

1997
01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:03,500
Cause like pineapple technically is like...

1998
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:04,660
I think that's called an allergy!

1999
01:00:04,660 --> 01:00:06,520
No, pineapple...

2000
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:08,560
No, pineapple is technically acidic for...

2001
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:09,620
Yeah, it's eating you.

2002
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:10,300
So like...

2003
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:10,980
It's acidic.

2004
01:00:11,380 --> 01:00:12,800
You're not supposed to eat pineapple.

2005
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:14,980
Cause it's slowly trying to digest you.

2006
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:15,780
But...

2007
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:18,180
For some reason, people just like that.

2008
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:24,960
I'm actually, I think, allergic to kiwi, because when I eat kiwi, my mouth goes funny.

2009
01:00:26,140 --> 01:00:27,700
No, I'm pretty sure...

2010
01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:29,660
I'm pretty sure, like...

2011
01:00:29,660 --> 01:00:32,160
Like, um, it's supposed to do that, right?

2012
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:33,760
Oh, is it?

2013
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:34,920
I don't think so.

2014
01:00:35,060 --> 01:00:37,180
Oh, there's some more shrooms that I don't know if I'm eating.

2015
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:37,700
Oh, these ones are good.

2016
01:00:37,820 --> 01:00:38,380
I think.

2017
01:00:38,620 --> 01:00:39,940
Maybe we can test it out.

2018
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:40,360
Oh my god, no.

2019
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:41,980
I don't trust your mushroom opinion.

2020
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:43,840
Eat two, eat two.

2021
01:00:43,860 --> 01:00:44,560
Eat it, Snuffy.

2022
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:45,920
Eat two to see if it...

2023
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:47,100
If it's extra poisoning.

2024
01:00:47,340 --> 01:00:48,500
I did, I ate two and I said what's alive now.

2025
01:00:49,420 --> 01:00:50,300
See, she's okay.

2026
01:00:50,300 --> 01:00:51,420
She's not turning purple.

2027
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:52,000
Yeah.

2028
01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:54,680
This one was good, I told you.

2029
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:55,820
The boogle or whatever.

2030
01:00:55,820 --> 01:00:57,660
You know this game was made in two...

2031
01:00:57,660 --> 01:00:59,080
Was made in two weeks?

2032
01:00:59,240 --> 01:00:59,860
That's crazy.

2033
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:02,340
This game was made in two weeks.

2034
01:01:02,340 --> 01:01:03,600
Yeah, it was made in two weeks.

2035
01:01:03,740 --> 01:01:05,720
It was supposed to be, like, a one-off game.

2036
01:01:05,900 --> 01:01:07,340
I wonder if I can jump up there or if I should go over there.

2037
01:01:07,460 --> 01:01:08,840
Hey, Snuffy, I'm gonna hurt you.

2038
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:10,400
I don't recommend the route that I took, actually.

2039
01:01:10,980 --> 01:01:11,960
Oh, I was gonna say, I think we should...

2040
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:12,880
No, you go left side.

2041
01:01:12,940 --> 01:01:13,660
No, you go left side.

2042
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:15,360
See, there's a left thing over there.

2043
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:18,100
Oh, I know where it's raining.

2044
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:18,340
See?

2045
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:18,800
I know where it's raining.

2046
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:20,560
That's a good...

2047
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:21,660
I don't think so.

2048
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:22,200
Oh, never mind.

2049
01:01:22,300 --> 01:01:23,520
Yeah, you went the harder route.

2050
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:24,040
Do you see?

2051
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:24,440
Wait!

2052
01:01:24,660 --> 01:01:24,800
Wait!

2053
01:01:25,820 --> 01:01:26,420
Oh, please!

2054
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:26,960
No!

2055
01:01:28,140 --> 01:01:28,280
Oh!

2056
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:30,160
Yes!

2057
01:01:30,740 --> 01:01:31,160
You did it?

2058
01:01:32,340 --> 01:01:32,840
You're okay.

2059
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:33,480
She's okay.

2060
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:34,520
Are you okay?

2061
01:01:36,580 --> 01:01:36,980
Um...

2062
01:01:36,980 --> 01:01:38,680
There is something up top.

2063
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:40,120
I don't know if you can climb up there.

2064
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:43,080
I don't know if you can make it.

2065
01:01:44,780 --> 01:01:45,540
Let me see.

2066
01:01:50,980 --> 01:01:52,040
Yeah, I'm just having a little...

2067
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:53,560
Yeah, no, no, you definitely can't make it.

2068
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:54,460
You definitely can't make it.

2069
01:01:54,540 --> 01:01:55,320
It's really, really far.

2070
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:55,680
Goodbye.

2071
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:58,100
Thank you.

2072
01:01:58,440 --> 01:01:58,820
Oh, my God.

2073
01:01:58,860 --> 01:01:59,080
Okay.

2074
01:01:59,700 --> 01:02:01,300
No, you definitely can't make it.

2075
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:03,500
I don't like this game because I have to watch you guys fall to your desk like a million times.

2076
01:02:04,580 --> 01:02:05,340
What do we do?

2077
01:02:05,340 --> 01:02:06,540
Alright, let me try this one then.

2078
01:02:06,580 --> 01:02:06,940
Hold on.

2079
01:02:07,380 --> 01:02:07,600
Okay.

2080
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:09,040
I think this is our best option.

2081
01:02:09,180 --> 01:02:09,860
I think so, too.

2082
01:02:09,940 --> 01:02:10,780
I mean, you have the rope.

2083
01:02:10,780 --> 01:02:11,900
Yeah, you have the rope sitting.

2084
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:12,260
Yeah.

2085
01:02:14,460 --> 01:02:15,360
Where'd the rope go?

2086
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:15,920
No.

2087
01:02:16,220 --> 01:02:17,680
Yeah, it's um...

2088
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:18,120
Um...

2089
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:19,180
We didn't need...

2090
01:02:19,180 --> 01:02:19,400
Okay.

2091
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:20,260
But it's there now.

2092
01:02:20,420 --> 01:02:20,820
Hold on.

2093
01:02:21,100 --> 01:02:21,740
I think...

2094
01:02:21,740 --> 01:02:22,920
Well, they need it.

2095
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:24,340
They need it.

2096
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:24,820
I need it.

2097
01:02:24,820 --> 01:02:25,320
Yeah, yeah.

2098
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:28,160
The babies need it.

2099
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:28,540
Yeah.

2100
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:30,320
I put it down.

2101
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:31,160
It should be there now.

2102
01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:32,440
Alright.

2103
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:35,540
Man, you can just drop to the ground and pick it up from there.

2104
01:02:35,540 --> 01:02:36,560
I don't know if I'm gonna make it.

2105
01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:36,920
Line!

2106
01:02:37,220 --> 01:02:37,460
Oh!

2107
01:02:37,660 --> 01:02:38,240
Grab the rope!

2108
01:02:38,420 --> 01:02:38,820
Grab the rope!

2109
01:02:39,060 --> 01:02:39,220
Grab the rope!

2110
01:02:40,140 --> 01:02:40,720
Grab the rope!

2111
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:42,260
The baby is fall.

2112
01:02:45,100 --> 01:02:45,800
Shut up.

2113
01:02:45,860 --> 01:02:48,020
Just because you fell and died doesn't mean the rest of us have you.

2114
01:02:48,020 --> 01:02:49,780
Someone did not catch me!

2115
01:02:49,780 --> 01:02:51,260
They're like, you'll make it!

2116
01:02:51,260 --> 01:02:51,360
Make it!

2117
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:53,020
And they lied!

2118
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:54,200
You didn't!

2119
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:54,560
Why?

2120
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:56,100
They lied.

2121
01:02:56,540 --> 01:02:57,460
I was lied to.

2122
01:02:57,680 --> 01:02:58,920
I ran and everything.

2123
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:00,100
This ghost is annoying.

2124
01:03:00,100 --> 01:03:00,920
I had a...

2125
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:01,120
Why?

2126
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:01,340
I know.

2127
01:03:01,340 --> 01:03:04,620
How could I fucking catch you to plummet halfway through the chasm?

2128
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:07,420
I should have been caught!

2129
01:03:08,140 --> 01:03:09,920
I don't know if we can get around here.

2130
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:11,140
This is really sketch.

2131
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:11,640
Yeah.

2132
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:13,500
There is a ledge on the...

2133
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:15,100
There is a ledge on the far right.

2134
01:03:15,220 --> 01:03:16,000
You can just walk it.

2135
01:03:16,100 --> 01:03:16,940
I think it's okay.

2136
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:17,760
Yeah.

2137
01:03:18,060 --> 01:03:18,200
See?

2138
01:03:18,340 --> 01:03:18,680
Look at that.

2139
01:03:18,700 --> 01:03:20,280
I'm such a fucking helpful ghost.

2140
01:03:20,360 --> 01:03:21,120
I deserve a tip.

2141
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:22,960
She's backseating us.

2142
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:23,720
Oh, yeah?

2143
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:24,240
Yeah?

2144
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:25,880
Weird.

2145
01:03:27,740 --> 01:03:28,940
We're in the crevice.

2146
01:03:28,940 --> 01:03:29,380
Ooh!

2147
01:03:29,620 --> 01:03:29,840
Look!

2148
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:31,000
We're cave diving!

2149
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:32,120
We're cave diving!

2150
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:33,340
Oh my god!

2151
01:03:33,540 --> 01:03:34,040
This is it!

2152
01:03:34,140 --> 01:03:35,600
This is the cave diving part!

2153
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:37,820
There's no way...

2154
01:03:37,820 --> 01:03:38,580
That looks really dangerous.

2155
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:39,120
Oh my god!

2156
01:03:39,260 --> 01:03:41,020
The fuck?

2157
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:42,000
Wait, no.

2158
01:03:42,060 --> 01:03:42,740
You climb up.

2159
01:03:42,820 --> 01:03:43,700
I'm mad about the fog.

2160
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,700
If you climb up from that side.

2161
01:03:46,100 --> 01:03:46,140
I don't know.

2162
01:03:46,140 --> 01:03:47,040
There's like the left side.

2163
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:48,140
There's something on the left.

2164
01:03:49,460 --> 01:03:49,720
Where?

2165
01:03:50,060 --> 01:03:50,740
No, no, no.

2166
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:51,420
On the...

2167
01:03:51,420 --> 01:03:51,940
Behind you line.

2168
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:52,540
Behind you.

2169
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:52,920
There's...

2170
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:53,360
It's green.

2171
01:03:56,180 --> 01:03:56,580
No.

2172
01:03:56,860 --> 01:03:57,360
Behind you.

2173
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:58,260
No.

2174
01:03:58,380 --> 01:03:58,880
Behind you.

2175
01:03:58,880 --> 01:03:59,360
That...

2176
01:03:59,360 --> 01:03:59,520
Rock.

2177
01:04:00,980 --> 01:04:01,840
Okay, yeah, but...

2178
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:04,160
But, like, I don't think we can get any further from there.

2179
01:04:04,300 --> 01:04:05,100
This is, like, closed.

2180
01:04:05,540 --> 01:04:06,060
Oh, shit.

2181
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:07,300
Okay, I...

2182
01:04:07,300 --> 01:04:07,740
Yeah.

2183
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:08,480
Okay, hold on.

2184
01:04:10,540 --> 01:04:12,020
Yeah, I think we found the edge of the map.

2185
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:13,060
We're too far over.

2186
01:04:13,260 --> 01:04:14,580
Oh my god, the fog is so high.

2187
01:04:16,660 --> 01:04:17,560
Snuffy's, like, fucked it?

2188
01:04:18,680 --> 01:04:19,820
Wait, where do you go?

2189
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:22,040
Yeah, where do you go?

2190
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:25,260
We kind of lifted too far to one side, I guess, maybe?

2191
01:04:25,540 --> 01:04:25,740
Wait, look.

2192
01:04:25,780 --> 01:04:27,380
There's a ledge on the top.

2193
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:28,980
If only you had another rope.

2194
01:04:30,420 --> 01:04:31,260
If only.

2195
01:04:33,340 --> 01:04:34,020
Oh, man.

2196
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:36,560
My backpack had so many ropes, guys.

2197
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:38,280
It didn't have any ropes.

2198
01:04:38,580 --> 01:04:40,460
It had so many ropes.

2199
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:41,700
It had none.

2200
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:43,780
I looked in your backpack many times.

2201
01:04:44,020 --> 01:04:44,520
No, no, no.

2202
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:46,240
I had at least one.

2203
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,980
I'm gonna try if I can maybe make this.

2204
01:04:50,740 --> 01:04:51,820
Wait, men had...

2205
01:04:51,820 --> 01:04:52,140
Wait, no.

2206
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:54,920
Why not use the yellow thing?

2207
01:04:55,860 --> 01:04:56,820
Can I use a baton?

2208
01:04:56,860 --> 01:04:57,020
Can I use a baton?

2209
01:04:57,700 --> 01:04:58,320
I have a baton.

2210
01:04:58,400 --> 01:04:58,920
No, I...

2211
01:04:58,920 --> 01:04:59,940
No, the baton.

2212
01:05:00,300 --> 01:05:00,400
Oh.

2213
01:05:02,020 --> 01:05:02,740
The baton.

2214
01:05:03,220 --> 01:05:03,880
Whatever that is.

2215
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:04,260
Whatever that is.

2216
01:05:07,260 --> 01:05:07,980
It's a wall?

2217
01:05:08,420 --> 01:05:08,780
It...

2218
01:05:08,780 --> 01:05:10,400
It goes in a wall and you hold it.

2219
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:11,340
It looks...

2220
01:05:11,340 --> 01:05:13,000
It looks like it's, like, sheer, though.

2221
01:05:14,620 --> 01:05:15,380
Oh god, the fog.

2222
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:16,560
The fog!

2223
01:05:16,620 --> 01:05:17,520
I think you guys might die.

2224
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:18,120
I'm afraid of ya.

2225
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:19,420
Hey, maybe...

2226
01:05:19,420 --> 01:05:20,500
Just jump in the fog.

2227
01:05:20,740 --> 01:05:20,860
What's that?

2228
01:05:20,860 --> 01:05:21,300
It's saying...

2229
01:05:21,300 --> 01:05:22,840
It's where all your friends are.

2230
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:24,640
Oh wow, I see it.

2231
01:05:24,660 --> 01:05:25,980
It really is kind of foggy.

2232
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:26,420
Yeah.

2233
01:05:27,420 --> 01:05:29,360
Whoa, it's like getting all...

2234
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:29,480
Whoa.

2235
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:29,960
Say hi.

2236
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:32,300
All your friends are over there.

2237
01:05:32,660 --> 01:05:32,840
Come on.

2238
01:05:33,180 --> 01:05:34,420
Chat's over there too.

2239
01:05:35,820 --> 01:05:36,840
Oh, you're not gonna make it.

2240
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:38,200
I will.

2241
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:39,520
You're not gonna make it.

2242
01:05:39,740 --> 01:05:40,240
Grounds, you're right.

2243
01:05:40,340 --> 01:05:41,840
You're not gonna make it.

2244
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:42,380
Whoa.

2245
01:05:42,860 --> 01:05:42,980
Oh!

2246
01:05:43,540 --> 01:05:43,820
Hello.

2247
01:05:44,340 --> 01:05:44,820
Hello.

2248
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:48,960
I don't have enough stamina!

2249
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:50,200
You're gonna...

2250
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:50,760
You're gonna...

2251
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:51,040
Keep going!

2252
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:51,860
Go!

2253
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:54,540
I don't have enough stamina!

2254
01:05:55,180 --> 01:05:55,700
Wait.

2255
01:05:55,960 --> 01:05:57,740
Min, do you have your peton still?

2256
01:05:58,480 --> 01:05:58,820
Yeah.

2257
01:05:59,940 --> 01:06:00,300
You're...

2258
01:06:00,300 --> 01:06:00,740
You can...

2259
01:06:00,740 --> 01:06:03,420
Oh, she's getting eaten by the fog!

2260
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:07,220
And then put your peton whenever you can't have enough stamina.

2261
01:06:08,220 --> 01:06:09,480
He's getting...

2262
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:10,560
Um, yum, yum!

2263
01:06:10,740 --> 01:06:11,220
He's gonna die!

2264
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:13,220
She's gonna die in the fog!

2265
01:06:13,300 --> 01:06:15,320
I'm gonna watch it happen!

2266
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:16,760
No, no!

2267
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:18,620
The fog calls for you!

2268
01:06:19,080 --> 01:06:19,380
I'm gonna die in the fog!

2269
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:20,420
Yes!

2270
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:22,700
Yes!

2271
01:06:22,860 --> 01:06:23,240
Yes!

2272
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:24,600
Yes!

2273
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:24,840
Yes!

2274
01:06:25,840 --> 01:06:26,000
Yes!

2275
01:06:26,780 --> 01:06:27,060
Yes!

2276
01:06:27,080 --> 01:06:27,460
Yes!

2277
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:28,360
Yes!

2278
01:06:29,220 --> 01:06:29,940
Oh, it's healthy.

2279
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:32,840
The fog calls.

2280
01:06:32,980 --> 01:06:34,760
Wait, I keep grabbing, but it's not grabbing.

2281
01:06:35,180 --> 01:06:37,460
Do the last dupe before you go.

2282
01:06:38,360 --> 01:06:39,540
Play your depth.

2283
01:06:39,780 --> 01:06:41,900
Play your depth sound.

2284
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:42,520
I'm grabbing it?

2285
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:43,360
Oh, it didn't work.

2286
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:43,600
It's time.

2287
01:06:43,740 --> 01:06:44,560
Bring out the trumpet.

2288
01:07:01,890 --> 01:07:04,850
Go down the Titanic.

2289
01:07:07,670 --> 01:07:10,230
Wait, why did Stuffy die?

2290
01:07:10,790 --> 01:07:12,830
Wait, what the fuck?

2291
01:07:13,450 --> 01:07:15,130
Wait, why did Stuffy die?

2292
01:07:18,910 --> 01:07:20,170
Stuffy don't know.

2293
01:07:21,050 --> 01:07:23,070
I get, we gotta keep the dream alive.

2294
01:07:23,570 --> 01:07:24,930
Stuffy, when did you die?

2295
01:07:26,590 --> 01:07:27,910
We'll never know.

2296
01:07:28,210 --> 01:07:30,330
We'll never know when she died.

2297
01:07:33,630 --> 01:07:37,790
Ooh, the ghosts of all your friends are watching you now.

2298
01:07:38,050 --> 01:07:38,370
Hello?

2299
01:07:38,910 --> 01:07:39,490
Am I a ghost?

2300
01:07:39,810 --> 01:07:40,510
Yeah, you are.

2301
01:07:40,690 --> 01:07:41,670
Stuffy, when did you die?

2302
01:07:42,090 --> 01:07:45,490
I didn't have enough stamina to climb, so I just tried and yola'd it.

2303
01:07:45,490 --> 01:07:47,010
And you had enough.

2304
01:07:48,630 --> 01:07:55,130
Mint, like, played the trumpet while she died to the fog until it consumed her.

2305
01:07:59,110 --> 01:08:00,230
Oh, football, brain.

2306
01:08:01,890 --> 01:08:04,370
I don't think Mint knows that she... Oh, there you are.

2307
01:08:04,470 --> 01:08:04,990
There she is.

2308
01:08:05,110 --> 01:08:05,610
Oh, she wears it.

2309
01:08:06,010 --> 01:08:07,570
She's wearing her sunglasses, too.

2310
01:08:08,010 --> 01:08:11,850
Oh, you're so cute, and your little Mint fan told me for her.

2311
01:08:11,850 --> 01:08:13,410
Yeah, she's a whiz now.

2312
01:08:14,050 --> 01:08:15,510
How do you move around?

2313
01:08:15,810 --> 01:08:16,610
Oh, you scroll wheel.

2314
01:08:17,210 --> 01:08:18,190
It's just that.

2315
01:08:19,090 --> 01:08:21,310
So he is like, forward, back.

2316
01:08:21,550 --> 01:08:22,990
Oh, I can get so close to you.

2317
01:08:23,230 --> 01:08:23,770
Yeah, me too.

2318
01:08:26,310 --> 01:08:27,710
Remember what you did!

2319
01:08:28,430 --> 01:08:31,790
We are the ghosts of Christmas past, present, and future!

2320
01:08:32,510 --> 01:08:33,930
Wait, you're so close!

2321
01:08:34,350 --> 01:08:35,190
You're so close!

2322
01:08:35,670 --> 01:08:36,130
Right?

2323
01:08:36,990 --> 01:08:37,770
Is she?

2324
01:08:38,030 --> 01:08:38,230
Maybe?

2325
01:08:38,570 --> 01:08:38,970
Sniffer.

2326
01:08:39,390 --> 01:08:40,010
I don't know.

2327
01:08:40,230 --> 01:08:41,450
You're on a ledge and it's more open.

2328
01:08:41,850 --> 01:08:43,090
Oh yeah, there it is.

2329
01:08:43,130 --> 01:08:44,230
Oh yeah, I see a campfire!

2330
01:08:44,430 --> 01:08:45,370
I see a campfire!

2331
01:08:46,030 --> 01:08:46,650
You do?

2332
01:08:47,030 --> 01:08:48,050
Yeah, it's at the very top!

2333
01:08:48,370 --> 01:08:49,050
You see the smoke?

2334
01:08:49,450 --> 01:08:49,950
Oh my god.

2335
01:08:50,490 --> 01:08:50,790
No.

2336
01:08:51,270 --> 01:08:52,590
Okay, you look up.

2337
01:08:53,210 --> 01:08:54,550
Like, look up from it.

2338
01:08:54,570 --> 01:08:55,430
We are looking up.

2339
01:08:55,770 --> 01:08:57,530
There's like a luggage on those vines.

2340
01:08:57,730 --> 01:08:58,130
That's crazy.

2341
01:08:58,410 --> 01:08:59,750
I am not touching that shit.

2342
01:09:01,850 --> 01:09:03,790
The luggage is so evil.

2343
01:09:04,070 --> 01:09:04,910
Why did it do that?

2344
01:09:06,270 --> 01:09:09,090
Oh my gosh, you have such good health and everything.

2345
01:09:10,790 --> 01:09:12,350
That's why she's a tour guide.

2346
01:09:12,510 --> 01:09:12,910
That's why she's a tour guide.

2347
01:09:12,910 --> 01:09:14,130
Wait, why do I have a grungle?

2348
01:09:14,250 --> 01:09:14,990
Oh no, that's you.

2349
01:09:17,930 --> 01:09:18,890
It's a grungle.

2350
01:09:19,070 --> 01:09:19,370
It's a grungle.

2351
01:09:19,370 --> 01:09:20,030
Apparently you can...

2352
01:09:20,030 --> 01:09:20,510
It's that little bird place.

2353
01:09:20,510 --> 01:09:21,550
Yeah, it's the...

2354
01:09:21,550 --> 01:09:22,690
It's name is Bing Bong.

2355
01:09:23,050 --> 01:09:23,210
Is it?

2356
01:09:23,750 --> 01:09:24,150
Oh...

2357
01:09:25,010 --> 01:09:27,070
Wait, where did you get grungle from?

2358
01:09:27,070 --> 01:09:30,190
Yeah, where did you get grungle from it?

2359
01:09:30,990 --> 01:09:32,070
I don't...

2360
01:09:32,070 --> 01:09:33,010
I don't know.

2361
01:09:33,390 --> 01:09:35,510
The hottest new thing, the grungles.

2362
01:09:37,270 --> 01:09:38,390
Wait, I'm gonna move myself.

2363
01:09:38,390 --> 01:09:40,730
My favorite character, Mr. Grungle.

2364
01:09:41,970 --> 01:09:42,950
Oh, whoops, that's the game.

2365
01:09:44,250 --> 01:09:46,150
Is there a better path to take here?

2366
01:09:47,530 --> 01:09:48,070
Um...

2367
01:09:48,070 --> 01:09:49,010
Maybe to the left?

2368
01:09:52,330 --> 01:09:52,730
Yeah.

2369
01:09:52,910 --> 01:09:54,170
To the left, you climb up.

2370
01:09:54,170 --> 01:09:55,190
I don't think I can make that.

2371
01:09:55,310 --> 01:09:55,670
Hold on.

2372
01:09:56,050 --> 01:09:56,950
Oh, I don't think...

2373
01:09:56,950 --> 01:09:58,270
I don't know, there is a...

2374
01:09:58,270 --> 01:09:58,790
There we go.

2375
01:09:59,590 --> 01:10:01,590
The left side seems nice, though.

2376
01:10:02,050 --> 01:10:03,010
Seems a lot nicer.

2377
01:10:04,270 --> 01:10:05,050
How are you gonna get past that?

2378
01:10:05,050 --> 01:10:06,890
I think there's a lot less poison up here.

2379
01:10:08,050 --> 01:10:08,450
That's nice.

2380
01:10:08,450 --> 01:10:09,770
I'm just having trouble, like...

2381
01:10:09,770 --> 01:10:09,910
That's nice.

2382
01:10:09,910 --> 01:10:10,470
Like, ugh.

2383
01:10:13,590 --> 01:10:15,070
I think you gotta go right, man.

2384
01:10:15,310 --> 01:10:15,810
I don't know.

2385
01:10:16,030 --> 01:10:16,390
Really?

2386
01:10:16,390 --> 01:10:18,190
Unless you can walk up left side.

2387
01:10:18,390 --> 01:10:19,470
Like, it's like...

2388
01:10:19,470 --> 01:10:21,790
Just grab a sports drink, and then YOLO.

2389
01:10:24,110 --> 01:10:25,610
Yeah, drink that sports drink.

2390
01:10:29,380 --> 01:10:30,740
Yeah, and then...

2391
01:10:30,740 --> 01:10:33,400
Okay, you picked the scarier part, but that's...

2392
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:33,900
Oh, wait, wait, wait!

2393
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:34,300
There's this!

2394
01:10:34,580 --> 01:10:36,140
Then you go up, then you keep going up!

2395
01:10:36,460 --> 01:10:36,820
She's gaming!

2396
01:10:37,140 --> 01:10:37,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

2397
01:10:37,860 --> 01:10:38,760
She's doing it!

2398
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:40,040
MLG!

2399
01:10:40,040 --> 01:10:40,620
4...

2400
01:10:41,160 --> 01:10:42,200
420, no scope!

2401
01:10:43,780 --> 01:10:44,260
Yay!

2402
01:10:45,100 --> 01:10:45,380
Yay!

2403
01:10:45,380 --> 01:10:45,580
No bad!

2404
01:10:51,060 --> 01:10:51,540
MVP!

2405
01:10:51,740 --> 01:10:52,440
We didn't do it!

2406
01:10:55,880 --> 01:10:57,580
Yay, bring us back!

2407
01:10:58,220 --> 01:10:59,480
Oh, she eepy now.

2408
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:01,180
Lime's eepy.

2409
01:11:01,180 --> 01:11:01,580
A little bit eepy.

2410
01:11:01,660 --> 01:11:02,220
Not too bad.

2411
01:11:03,060 --> 01:11:03,520
Not we.

2412
01:11:03,680 --> 01:11:04,340
She did it.

2413
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:05,240
We did it!

2414
01:11:05,300 --> 01:11:06,080
No, we were help.

2415
01:11:06,220 --> 01:11:06,460
We helped.

2416
01:11:07,320 --> 01:11:08,280
We backseated.

2417
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:08,980
Yay!

2418
01:11:10,020 --> 01:11:10,780
What's up?

2419
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:11,520
I'm hungry.

2420
01:11:12,240 --> 01:11:12,860
I'm gonna go eat.

2421
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:14,180
Om-yum-yum time.

2422
01:11:14,980 --> 01:11:17,460
Wait, what's the darkness mean in my little meter?

2423
01:11:18,020 --> 01:11:19,880
It means we died and came back.

2424
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:20,000
It means like when you revive.

2425
01:11:20,740 --> 01:11:23,980
Where's the luggage that you're supposed to- The- What the heck?

2426
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:24,740
There's one up here.

2427
01:11:25,460 --> 01:11:25,740
What?

2428
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:29,020
I don't think it's supposed to- Is it supposed to spawn there?

2429
01:11:29,240 --> 01:11:29,420
What?

2430
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:32,360
Can you even get- You can't climb these kinds of trees, can you?

2431
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:33,320
Yeah, what is that?

2432
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:35,200
What?

2433
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:37,040
Okay.

2434
01:11:37,300 --> 01:11:37,440
Can you?

2435
01:11:37,720 --> 01:11:39,000
I got morale boost.

2436
01:11:39,540 --> 01:11:41,480
I got morale boost.

2437
01:11:41,480 --> 01:11:43,240
Ew, I'm cooking my mushroom.

2438
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:44,540
Did I just- Did I just not get a mushroom?

2439
01:11:44,660 --> 01:11:45,320
I guess so.

2440
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:45,840
Marshmallow?

2441
01:11:46,540 --> 01:11:48,220
Did someone steal two marshmallows?

2442
01:11:48,540 --> 01:11:50,220
We all keep- I took only one.

2443
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:50,940
I took one.

2444
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:52,700
Wait, there's a- Here.

2445
01:11:53,300 --> 01:11:53,940
I can cook it again.

2446
01:11:54,460 --> 01:11:54,900
Doki.

2447
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:57,360
Well done, Marshmallow.

2448
01:11:57,480 --> 01:11:58,700
Did you just feed this to me?

2449
01:12:00,780 --> 01:12:01,180
Oh.

2450
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:05,660
The yellow- I was resurrected to live a life of nothing but suffering.

2451
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:06,000
No!

2452
01:12:06,180 --> 01:12:06,520
No!

2453
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:07,600
It does.

2454
01:12:08,180 --> 01:12:08,540
It does.

2455
01:12:08,540 --> 01:12:09,800
No, the yellow ones are good.

2456
01:12:09,820 --> 01:12:10,660
The yellow ones are good.

2457
01:12:11,020 --> 01:12:11,900
The yellow ones are good.

2458
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:12,460
Are you sure?

2459
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:13,700
Oh, wait.

2460
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:14,700
It's your marshmallow.

2461
01:12:14,920 --> 01:12:15,440
It is your marshmallow.

2462
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:16,120
That's right.

2463
01:12:16,340 --> 01:12:16,620
Okay.

2464
01:12:17,260 --> 01:12:18,200
I'll cook it quick.

2465
01:12:18,660 --> 01:12:19,660
Okay, I'm gonna eat mine.

2466
01:12:19,660 --> 01:12:20,360
I'll cook it.

2467
01:12:20,500 --> 01:12:21,140
Oh, wow.

2468
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:22,700
That's nice of you, Mint, though.

2469
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:23,500
Double cook it.

2470
01:12:23,500 --> 01:12:23,740
See?

2471
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:24,640
Look, thank you, Mint.

2472
01:12:25,020 --> 01:12:26,200
I gave her my marshmallow.

2473
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:27,600
I'm such a good person.

2474
01:12:28,540 --> 01:12:29,000
Shut up.

2475
01:12:29,420 --> 01:12:29,600
Uh-huh.

2476
01:12:31,380 --> 01:12:33,720
I have a curse placed upon my soul now.

2477
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:34,760
That looks intense.

2478
01:12:36,220 --> 01:12:37,080
Alright, where do we go?

2479
01:12:37,240 --> 01:12:38,340
Oh, it's the ice one.

2480
01:12:39,820 --> 01:12:40,140
Hi.

2481
01:12:40,140 --> 01:12:41,500
Is there a berry in here, too?

2482
01:12:41,740 --> 01:12:43,020
No, we ate all the berries.

2483
01:12:43,020 --> 01:12:44,900
I don't know how long we're gonna make it here, guys.

2484
01:12:45,140 --> 01:12:46,500
I feel like this one, uh...

2485
01:12:47,100 --> 01:12:47,380
What?

2486
01:12:47,620 --> 01:12:48,200
Oh, this one?

2487
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:50,040
Yeah, isn't that the death mountain?

2488
01:12:51,380 --> 01:12:51,820
Mint, though?

2489
01:12:51,820 --> 01:12:54,000
Isn't that specifically the death mountain?

2490
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:55,160
Mint, though?

2491
01:12:56,360 --> 01:12:57,080
I'm here.

2492
01:12:57,360 --> 01:12:57,780
I'm here.

2493
01:12:57,780 --> 01:12:57,920
I'm on, Mint.

2494
01:12:57,940 --> 01:13:01,740
Maybe we're supposed to use, like, one of those, like, ropes and, like...

2495
01:13:01,740 --> 01:13:02,240
Yeah, I feel that.

2496
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:03,380
Yeah, I feel that.

2497
01:13:03,380 --> 01:13:05,700
Yeah, I feel that this is where we should have kept all our materials.

2498
01:13:07,260 --> 01:13:10,400
The last part is kind of, like, good for that.

2499
01:13:10,660 --> 01:13:10,800
Yeah.

2500
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:12,600
This is the end.

2501
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:16,580
This is where Mount Everest mod would have came in handy.

2502
01:13:17,100 --> 01:13:18,380
Where I've seen all the...

2503
01:13:18,380 --> 01:13:20,240
All the skeletons.

2504
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:22,340
All the skellies.

2505
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:24,240
Yeah, all the skellies scattered around.

2506
01:13:24,240 --> 01:13:26,660
This is saying around...

2507
01:13:26,660 --> 01:13:26,920
Ow!

2508
01:13:27,540 --> 01:13:27,580
Ow!

2509
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:29,880
Ow!

2510
01:13:30,740 --> 01:13:30,860
There's aνε!

2511
01:13:30,860 --> 01:13:32,400
Get into shelter when that happens!

2512
01:13:34,220 --> 01:13:34,880
I feel it.

2513
01:13:34,940 --> 01:13:37,180
I'm so cold, Scoutmaster Lama!

2514
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:37,620
Oh my god.

2515
01:13:37,640 --> 01:13:38,080
Is it still happening?

2516
01:13:38,380 --> 01:13:39,400
It's like on the edge of the biome!

2517
01:13:39,400 --> 01:13:39,520
I'm so cold!

2518
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:40,260
it's like on the edge of the biome.

2519
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:42,160
Yeah...

2520
01:13:42,160 --> 01:13:44,140
Scoutmaster We got warm..

2521
01:13:44,140 --> 01:13:46,300
This way is slow, this way is slow.

2522
01:13:46,720 --> 01:13:48,120
You can actually hablar.

2523
01:13:49,320 --> 01:13:50,240
Come, come, come.

2524
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:51,020
This is safe.

2525
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:53,280
I'm feeling so safe now.

2526
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:55,640
I'm here.

2527
01:13:57,760 --> 01:13:59,940
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

2528
01:13:59,960 --> 01:14:04,360
It's always good in this biome that we'll have to stay near objects where we can hide behind.

2529
01:14:04,700 --> 01:14:06,520
To protect ourselves from freezing wind.

2530
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:07,440
Oh, that's smart.

2531
01:14:08,820 --> 01:14:10,020
Don't worry, I can't catch you.

2532
01:14:10,420 --> 01:14:11,500
I caught you.

2533
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:15,520
I'm a hero.

2534
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:16,980
It's a bit chilly, isn't it?

2535
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:17,380
Yes.

2536
01:14:17,380 --> 01:14:18,320
I'm a hero.

2537
01:14:19,060 --> 01:14:19,200
Maybe.

2538
01:14:20,220 --> 01:14:21,380
Is it Tuesday?

2539
01:14:22,820 --> 01:14:25,140
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

2540
01:14:25,240 --> 01:14:26,800
Don't worry, there's shelter here, guys.

2541
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:27,700
There's shelter here.

2542
01:14:28,140 --> 01:14:30,020
Yeah, sheltering, sheltering, sheltering.

2543
01:14:30,140 --> 01:14:30,680
Don't worry.

2544
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:31,080
Hi.

2545
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:32,620
Buddy, buddy.

2546
01:14:32,920 --> 01:14:33,180
Don't worry.

2547
01:14:33,680 --> 01:14:35,840
We got huddled together, so we'll be fine.

2548
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:38,980
We're so safe.

2549
01:14:41,180 --> 01:14:42,540
It's chilly, ain't it?

2550
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:45,940
You guys look so cute huddling behind the tree.

2551
01:14:46,180 --> 01:14:46,600
We're good.

2552
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:47,340
We're good.

2553
01:14:47,680 --> 01:14:47,800
Yeah.

2554
01:14:48,240 --> 01:14:49,880
Little babies over there.

2555
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:51,620
Oh, there's a chest over here.

2556
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:52,420
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

2557
01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:53,120
Yeah, we need that.

2558
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:53,620
We have nothing.

2559
01:14:54,140 --> 01:14:55,580
Don't worry, I'm fucking sprinting.

2560
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:56,620
A little springtime breeze.

2561
01:14:56,620 --> 01:14:57,740
I'm sprinting over.

2562
01:14:59,020 --> 01:15:00,620
Don't worry, I got this.

2563
01:15:02,020 --> 01:15:04,320
Okay, what's in our treasure chest?

2564
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:05,480
Wait, it's orange.

2565
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:06,560
I'm coming up.

2566
01:15:07,260 --> 01:15:07,740
Special.

2567
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:09,700
Oh, it's a special rescue kit.

2568
01:15:09,940 --> 01:15:10,220
Luggage.

2569
01:15:10,980 --> 01:15:12,960
Oh, I've been a good boy!

2570
01:15:14,260 --> 01:15:16,320
Father said, I've been a good boy.

2571
01:15:16,700 --> 01:15:17,180
Oh, my God.

2572
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:19,340
Wait, that actually suits you all the time.

2573
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,360
You're filled with nothing but joy and bendy.

2574
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:24,020
Wait, that actually suits you.

2575
01:15:24,020 --> 01:15:25,920
Father said, I've been a good boy today.

2576
01:15:25,980 --> 01:15:27,640
But your face is so mean looking.

2577
01:15:27,860 --> 01:15:28,980
You're so unhappy about it.

2578
01:15:28,980 --> 01:15:30,960
I got a dentist so we get the lollipop.

2579
01:15:31,180 --> 01:15:33,140
No, it's my lollipop.

2580
01:15:34,720 --> 01:15:35,760
No one can have it.

2581
01:15:35,780 --> 01:15:37,280
Maybe one of the little spitterhots.

2582
01:15:37,400 --> 01:15:37,780
Yeah, a little spitterhots.

2583
01:15:37,780 --> 01:15:39,820
I can't have it, it's a little dog taste.

2584
01:15:40,440 --> 01:15:40,800
No!

2585
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:44,420
Go back to Poresville.

2586
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:44,900
Oh, wait.

2587
01:15:45,080 --> 01:15:46,320
Double one is over here.

2588
01:15:46,980 --> 01:15:47,480
Oh, really?

2589
01:15:47,780 --> 01:15:48,880
Oh, yeah, you're right, you're right.

2590
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:49,820
Oh, wait, there's two lollipops.

2591
01:15:50,160 --> 01:15:50,460
Oh, wow, yeah.

2592
01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:51,000
That's a lot.

2593
01:15:51,460 --> 01:15:52,320
Oh, oh, the blizzard.

2594
01:15:55,020 --> 01:15:55,620
Don't worry.

2595
01:15:56,120 --> 01:15:57,000
You guys wanna see my lollipop?

2596
01:15:57,880 --> 01:15:58,340
Oh, there comes a blizzard.

2597
01:15:58,340 --> 01:15:59,240
You wanna see it?

2598
01:15:59,460 --> 01:16:00,160
I'll let you...

2599
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:01,280
I'll let you look at it.

2600
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:01,500
Yeah, it's huge.

2601
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:02,340
It's bigger than your head.

2602
01:16:02,340 --> 01:16:03,500
I'll let you look at it.

2603
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:05,260
Can I lick you just a little bit?

2604
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:05,500
Nope.

2605
01:16:05,820 --> 01:16:06,240
Ten dollars.

2606
01:16:06,980 --> 01:16:07,420
Ten...

2607
01:16:07,420 --> 01:16:08,200
Ten dollars?

2608
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:09,060
Ten supas.

2609
01:16:10,280 --> 01:16:11,240
Ten supas?

2610
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:12,780
To me, or...?

2611
01:16:12,780 --> 01:16:13,440
To me.

2612
01:16:15,960 --> 01:16:17,720
Now it's twenty supas.

2613
01:16:20,520 --> 01:16:21,320
Oh, there's stuff.

2614
01:16:21,580 --> 01:16:22,880
Gosh, inflation is hurting us all.

2615
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:24,600
Oh, wait.

2616
01:16:24,820 --> 01:16:25,020
I'm coming.

2617
01:16:25,720 --> 01:16:26,380
What's in...

2618
01:16:26,380 --> 01:16:27,020
What was in there?

2619
01:16:28,240 --> 01:16:31,340
Um, a heating pack and an energy drink.

2620
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,200
Oh, there's an apple.

2621
01:16:33,680 --> 01:16:34,100
Wait, that's...

2622
01:16:34,100 --> 01:16:35,360
We should get that apple for...

2623
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:36,520
Like, and put it in...

2624
01:16:36,520 --> 01:16:37,120
There's a couple apples.

2625
01:16:37,740 --> 01:16:37,840
Yeah.

2626
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:38,400
Yeah, yeah.

2627
01:16:39,060 --> 01:16:39,660
They're good.

2628
01:16:39,900 --> 01:16:40,460
They're winter berries.

2629
01:16:40,460 --> 01:16:41,240
There's a few down...

2630
01:16:41,240 --> 01:16:42,200
Up here as well.

2631
01:16:42,360 --> 01:16:42,840
Oh, okay.

2632
01:16:42,920 --> 01:16:43,260
I'll go up there.

2633
01:16:43,340 --> 01:16:44,600
Oh, there's a tree up there too.

2634
01:16:45,480 --> 01:16:45,740
Okay, we'll go.

2635
01:16:45,740 --> 01:16:47,220
Yeah, cause we can only fit like...

2636
01:16:47,220 --> 01:16:48,740
A limited amount anyway.

2637
01:16:49,020 --> 01:16:50,100
Are orange ones okay?

2638
01:16:51,140 --> 01:16:51,780
Let's find out.

2639
01:16:51,820 --> 01:16:52,520
I'll test it.

2640
01:16:52,740 --> 01:16:53,860
I'll taste test it.

2641
01:16:53,940 --> 01:16:54,220
Okay.

2642
01:16:56,600 --> 01:16:58,000
Look at you grabbing that.

2643
01:16:58,940 --> 01:16:59,940
Oh, they're real good.

2644
01:17:00,100 --> 01:17:00,820
Grab a bunch.

2645
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:01,280
And put them in there.

2646
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:03,640
I have pack two.

2647
01:17:03,880 --> 01:17:04,360
I have pack two.

2648
01:17:04,360 --> 01:17:05,220
I can't climb it.

2649
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:05,720
Or in your pack.

2650
01:17:06,260 --> 01:17:07,980
How do you put things in your pack?

2651
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:08,700
Alright.

2652
01:17:08,980 --> 01:17:10,220
Take your pack off, put it on the floor.

2653
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:12,000
And then like hold E and put it in...

2654
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:13,360
Ooh, ooh, ah, ah.

2655
01:17:13,640 --> 01:17:15,720
It's really fiddly, so be careful in the mountain.

2656
01:17:16,020 --> 01:17:17,500
So you can actually throw your backpack off the floor.

2657
01:17:17,540 --> 01:17:17,820
Okay.

2658
01:17:18,460 --> 01:17:19,600
I got some oranges.

2659
01:17:20,100 --> 01:17:20,580
Can you hold your...

2660
01:17:20,580 --> 01:17:21,100
Wait.

2661
01:17:22,160 --> 01:17:23,440
I don't understand, but I...

2662
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:24,540
I got one orange.

2663
01:17:25,940 --> 01:17:26,340
Uh oh.

2664
01:17:26,820 --> 01:17:27,260
Uh oh.

2665
01:17:28,860 --> 01:17:29,500
Uh oh.

2666
01:17:29,500 --> 01:17:29,900
Uh oh.

2667
01:17:30,020 --> 01:17:30,920
I don't think this is enough.

2668
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:33,060
I'm an...

2669
01:17:33,060 --> 01:17:33,420
I'm okay.

2670
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:33,800
I'm okay.

2671
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:34,740
Right here, right here, right here.

2672
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:37,660
I got a backpack, so I can put the orange in here.

2673
01:17:38,740 --> 01:17:39,520
Okay, hold on.

2674
01:17:40,300 --> 01:17:40,980
Wait, actually, yeah.

2675
01:17:41,140 --> 01:17:42,620
No, actually, you drop in, I'll put it...

2676
01:17:42,620 --> 01:17:44,540
Oh, I was gonna say, I can put it in.

2677
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:45,240
There you go.

2678
01:17:46,260 --> 01:17:47,260
How do you put it in?

2679
01:17:47,540 --> 01:17:50,340
You, uh, you get your item out, and then you put it in.

2680
01:17:51,300 --> 01:17:52,340
That's what you got.

2681
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:53,240
Oh!

2682
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:53,660
Oh!

2683
01:17:54,640 --> 01:17:55,440
Oh my god!

2684
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:55,780
Yeah!

2685
01:17:56,240 --> 01:17:56,760
Look at that!

2686
01:17:57,180 --> 01:17:58,640
Now we have two oranges.

2687
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:04,340
All right, where do we go?

2688
01:18:04,820 --> 01:18:04,960
Hello.

2689
01:18:06,140 --> 01:18:06,180
Hello.

2690
01:18:06,220 --> 01:18:06,420
Hello.

2691
01:18:06,460 --> 01:18:06,700
This way!

2692
01:18:07,060 --> 01:18:08,260
Wait, there's something over here.

2693
01:18:08,380 --> 01:18:08,980
What is that?

2694
01:18:11,620 --> 01:18:12,740
Wait, I got a heat pack.

2695
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:14,760
Someone just left...

2696
01:18:15,480 --> 01:18:17,600
Someone just left a heat pack on the floor.

2697
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:18,560
The musicals?

2698
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:19,560
That was me.

2699
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:20,460
I ran out of room.

2700
01:18:21,220 --> 01:18:21,740
Oh.

2701
01:18:21,780 --> 01:18:22,780
I have...

2702
01:18:22,780 --> 01:18:23,500
I have...

2703
01:18:23,500 --> 01:18:24,560
I have room.

2704
01:18:24,760 --> 01:18:25,680
It's beautiful.

2705
01:18:25,900 --> 01:18:26,220
Okay.

2706
01:18:26,340 --> 01:18:27,600
Oh my god, it's so beautiful.

2707
01:18:28,260 --> 01:18:29,120
It's beautiful.

2708
01:18:29,900 --> 01:18:30,420
Oh!

2709
01:18:30,580 --> 01:18:31,640
It's not beautiful.

2710
01:18:32,060 --> 01:18:33,020
It's not beautiful.

2711
01:18:33,240 --> 01:18:33,800
It's not beautiful anymore.

2712
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:35,480
Oh my god, it's not beautiful.

2713
01:18:35,740 --> 01:18:36,140
It's safe here.

2714
01:18:36,220 --> 01:18:36,600
It's safe here.

2715
01:18:37,560 --> 01:18:38,600
It's safe here!

2716
01:18:38,780 --> 01:18:39,500
It's safe here!

2717
01:18:39,940 --> 01:18:40,460
It's safe here!

2718
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:43,540
Oh, I have found something.

2719
01:18:44,280 --> 01:18:45,120
Hey, guys.

2720
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:47,720
I got a fungus.

2721
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:48,840
Hey.

2722
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:50,000
I like your punches.

2723
01:18:50,580 --> 01:18:51,200
Yeah.

2724
01:18:52,740 --> 01:18:54,040
I'm climbing.

2725
01:18:58,870 --> 01:19:00,270
Here, take my hand!

2726
01:19:02,750 --> 01:19:03,810
Thank you.

2727
01:19:04,050 --> 01:19:04,450
Yeah, see?

2728
01:19:04,570 --> 01:19:05,150
Look at that.

2729
01:19:05,470 --> 01:19:07,110
I'm a teamwork person.

2730
01:19:07,450 --> 01:19:07,890
Teamwork.

2731
01:19:08,310 --> 01:19:09,150
That's me.

2732
01:19:11,510 --> 01:19:13,490
Teamwork makes the dream work.

2733
01:19:15,130 --> 01:19:16,910
Don't touch the lava.

2734
01:19:18,210 --> 01:19:19,810
Lava's dangerous.

2735
01:19:22,270 --> 01:19:24,230
It's like the floor is lava.

2736
01:19:27,990 --> 01:19:29,210
Can I do this?

2737
01:19:43,180 --> 01:19:44,960
The fog rises.

2738
01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:45,720
The fog rises.

2739
01:19:46,160 --> 01:19:46,960
Oh, this way?

2740
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:52,480
Is that what he said?

2741
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:53,720
I don't think I'm okay.

2742
01:19:53,720 --> 01:19:54,300
Oh, god.

2743
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:54,740
Oh.

2744
01:19:55,640 --> 01:19:56,420
I'm not okay.

2745
01:19:56,640 --> 01:19:56,900
What?

2746
01:19:57,040 --> 01:19:57,440
I'm right there.

2747
01:19:57,600 --> 01:19:57,980
There's lava.

2748
01:19:59,060 --> 01:19:59,720
If you can get near.

2749
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:01,100
Yeah, over here.

2750
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:01,540
Over here.

2751
01:20:01,680 --> 01:20:01,820
Come in.

2752
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:03,560
I'm coming up.

2753
01:20:03,740 --> 01:20:04,980
Yeah, we'll huddle together for once.

2754
01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:05,980
Snuffy can never do.

2755
01:20:06,160 --> 01:20:08,420
I'm gonna huddle over too, guys.

2756
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:10,560
Hi, Tucky.

2757
01:20:11,780 --> 01:20:12,160
Hi.

2758
01:20:12,200 --> 01:20:13,040
Come huddle.

2759
01:20:13,540 --> 01:20:14,740
We're like little penguins.

2760
01:20:15,100 --> 01:20:16,620
I don't know where Snuffy is.

2761
01:20:16,780 --> 01:20:17,000
I don't know.

2762
01:20:17,240 --> 01:20:17,480
I don't know.

2763
01:20:17,500 --> 01:20:18,800
Well, she's clearly not dead.

2764
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:20,840
I can hear her.

2765
01:20:21,100 --> 01:20:22,040
Yeah, she's not dead.

2766
01:20:22,040 --> 01:20:22,120
She's on the way.

2767
01:20:22,260 --> 01:20:22,960
So she's fine.

2768
01:20:25,220 --> 01:20:25,580
Marco!

2769
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:31,160
Marco!

2770
01:20:34,060 --> 01:20:34,380
Marco!

2771
01:20:34,380 --> 01:20:35,320
Oh, I'm another shell fungus.

2772
01:20:35,420 --> 01:20:35,680
Yeah, no.

2773
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:37,100
It's a shell fungus.

2774
01:20:37,260 --> 01:20:39,020
So you can make it to platforms.

2775
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:41,180
Put it in your little backpack.

2776
01:20:42,440 --> 01:20:42,700
Okay.

2777
01:20:43,400 --> 01:20:44,060
Wait, where do we...

2778
01:20:44,060 --> 01:20:44,660
Wait, Lamo!

2779
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:46,200
Yeah?

2780
01:20:46,500 --> 01:20:46,960
Where do we go?

2781
01:20:47,100 --> 01:20:47,700
Oh, there she is.

2782
01:20:48,820 --> 01:20:49,440
What's up?

2783
01:20:49,640 --> 01:20:50,560
Lamo, we're lost!

2784
01:20:50,740 --> 01:20:51,140
We're lost!

2785
01:20:51,180 --> 01:20:52,440
Go master Lamo!

2786
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:53,200
Where do we go?

2787
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:53,680
I think maybe this way.

2788
01:20:54,040 --> 01:20:54,780
I hate this map.

2789
01:20:55,500 --> 01:20:56,620
I changed my mind.

2790
01:20:56,720 --> 01:20:57,380
This map sucks too.

2791
01:20:57,740 --> 01:20:58,020
Yeah, no.

2792
01:20:58,120 --> 01:20:59,540
I heard this map was the hardest part.

2793
01:20:59,680 --> 01:21:00,460
I thought it was like, what?

2794
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:06,340
Surely the next one will be really easy.

2795
01:21:06,660 --> 01:21:07,440
Yeah, surely, right?

2796
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:08,700
I actually like the next one.

2797
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:09,460
The next one's good.

2798
01:21:09,640 --> 01:21:10,740
Wait, have you ever beaten it?

2799
01:21:11,720 --> 01:21:12,120
Yeah.

2800
01:21:12,520 --> 01:21:13,100
Wait, you have?

2801
01:21:14,100 --> 01:21:15,780
How many tries did it take you?

2802
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:22,200
Uh, a few because a couple of times I played and people were like, PVP'ing.

2803
01:21:22,820 --> 01:21:25,560
Oh, this is like, not like us because we clearly are working together.

2804
01:21:25,860 --> 01:21:26,040
Yeah, I know.

2805
01:21:26,160 --> 01:21:27,180
We're working together real good.

2806
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:27,780
We're working together.

2807
01:21:27,860 --> 01:21:28,720
Yeah, together.

2808
01:21:33,590 --> 01:21:34,740
We're good teammates.

2809
01:21:36,490 --> 01:21:37,590
Wait, what's happening?

2810
01:21:37,810 --> 01:21:38,170
Yeah!

2811
01:21:39,270 --> 01:21:39,890
What's happening?

2812
01:21:40,170 --> 01:21:40,450
What's happening?

2813
01:21:40,890 --> 01:21:41,330
Yeah!

2814
01:21:41,550 --> 01:21:43,130
It's kinda weird that spot there.

2815
01:21:45,850 --> 01:21:46,570
I don't know.

2816
01:21:46,570 --> 01:21:47,870
I don't know about this section.

2817
01:21:48,110 --> 01:21:48,790
It feels kinda weird.

2818
01:21:49,490 --> 01:21:50,370
KICK MY HAND!

2819
01:21:53,250 --> 01:21:54,030
Is Mint okay?

2820
01:21:54,190 --> 01:21:54,710
Wait, where's Mint?

2821
01:21:54,850 --> 01:21:55,610
Where did Mint go?

2822
01:21:59,210 --> 01:22:00,390
I was like, wait a minute.

2823
01:22:00,550 --> 01:22:00,970
Wait, one...

2824
01:22:01,950 --> 01:22:02,310
One...

2825
01:22:03,770 --> 01:22:04,130
Two...

2826
01:22:05,030 --> 01:22:05,390
Three...

2827
01:22:05,390 --> 01:22:06,450
I was like, wait a minute.

2828
01:22:06,570 --> 01:22:07,970
Did we have three when we started?

2829
01:22:12,610 --> 01:22:14,770
Wait, Mint has the backpack filled with oranges.

2830
01:22:14,790 --> 01:22:16,030
So we can't let her die.

2831
01:22:16,970 --> 01:22:18,410
At least grab the backpack.

2832
01:22:18,950 --> 01:22:19,730
She's like a capybara.

2833
01:22:20,770 --> 01:22:22,530
Yeah, she literally has all our materials.

2834
01:22:23,050 --> 01:22:24,210
We can't let her die.

2835
01:22:25,130 --> 01:22:26,010
I'm alive!

2836
01:22:29,030 --> 01:22:31,210
Yeah, I meant we can't let you die.

2837
01:22:31,450 --> 01:22:32,090
So you have...

2838
01:22:32,090 --> 01:22:33,190
Quick, give us the backpack.

2839
01:22:33,550 --> 01:22:35,010
And we'll pick you up later.

2840
01:22:36,310 --> 01:22:36,670
Okay.

2841
01:22:38,650 --> 01:22:40,410
I see the hot springs!

2842
01:22:40,750 --> 01:22:41,690
With the capybara!

2843
01:22:41,890 --> 01:22:42,390
Wait, you do?

2844
01:22:42,670 --> 01:22:44,430
There is hot springs with the capybara?

2845
01:22:44,650 --> 01:22:45,170
I see them!

2846
01:22:45,570 --> 01:22:46,590
Oh, I see it!

2847
01:22:46,830 --> 01:22:47,690
We can't go there.

2848
01:22:47,850 --> 01:22:49,210
We'll get fogged, I think.

2849
01:22:49,450 --> 01:22:50,670
Wait, but there's the capybara!

2850
01:22:53,970 --> 01:22:54,410
Yeah...

2851
01:22:54,410 --> 01:22:55,170
Yeah...

2852
01:22:55,170 --> 01:22:55,970
I'm gonna go see it.

2853
01:22:55,970 --> 01:22:56,450
Oh, they've got a way out.

2854
01:22:56,710 --> 01:22:57,190
Goodbye, everybody.

2855
01:23:01,810 --> 01:23:03,090
Sophia's like, I don't care.

2856
01:23:03,090 --> 01:23:04,270
I wanna see...

2857
01:23:04,270 --> 01:23:05,450
Wait, where are you guys going?

2858
01:23:05,450 --> 01:23:05,550
Okay.

2859
01:23:06,230 --> 01:23:07,190
Where do we go?

2860
01:23:08,050 --> 01:23:08,750
I'm watching the capybara.

2861
01:23:08,750 --> 01:23:10,730
Oh, there's a spot over to the right that might work.

2862
01:23:10,990 --> 01:23:11,250
Okay.

2863
01:23:12,670 --> 01:23:13,850
You mean the left?

2864
01:23:13,910 --> 01:23:14,930
I just got caught by the...

2865
01:23:14,930 --> 01:23:15,490
And thus...

2866
01:23:15,490 --> 01:23:18,290
The internal's okay, but you have to go over freezing rocks, which kinda sucks.

2867
01:23:19,610 --> 01:23:19,870
Woo!

2868
01:23:21,590 --> 01:23:22,030
Woo!

2869
01:23:24,670 --> 01:23:25,070
This

2870
01:23:29,220 --> 01:23:29,760
place sucks.

2871
01:23:30,020 --> 01:23:31,060
Yeah, this place sucks.

2872
01:23:31,980 --> 01:23:35,100
I think Sniffy might actually die for the capybara's.

2873
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:38,860
No, she won't.

2874
01:23:38,940 --> 01:23:39,320
I believe.

2875
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:39,760
I believe.

2876
01:23:40,080 --> 01:23:40,400
I believe.

2877
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:40,780
I see her.

2878
01:23:40,940 --> 01:23:41,240
Oh, she's...

2879
01:23:41,240 --> 01:23:42,060
She's going there.

2880
01:23:42,120 --> 01:23:42,740
I see her.

2881
01:23:43,720 --> 01:23:44,560
Yeah, I see her.

2882
01:23:44,640 --> 01:23:45,140
There she is.

2883
01:23:45,220 --> 01:23:45,880
She made it.

2884
01:23:46,240 --> 01:23:47,240
Wait, Laimo, is your...

2885
01:23:47,240 --> 01:23:48,620
Is your path the correct path?

2886
01:23:50,420 --> 01:23:51,520
No, this place sucks.

2887
01:23:51,780 --> 01:23:52,120
Hold on.

2888
01:23:52,160 --> 01:23:55,960
I think we should go reconvene at the capybara and decide if we can grow out.

2889
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:57,260
You just wanna...

2890
01:23:57,260 --> 01:23:59,460
You just wanna see the capybaras.

2891
01:23:59,460 --> 01:24:01,400
Oh my gosh, she's dancing with them.

2892
01:24:03,080 --> 01:24:04,420
What about the left side?

2893
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:06,140
Can we just go left?

2894
01:24:06,360 --> 01:24:07,880
Yeah, I think we need to head over this way.

2895
01:24:08,660 --> 01:24:09,020
Alright.

2896
01:24:09,240 --> 01:24:09,820
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

2897
01:24:10,120 --> 01:24:10,540
Before you...

2898
01:24:10,540 --> 01:24:11,500
You have to get the backpack!

2899
01:24:12,340 --> 01:24:13,740
Men, you have the backpack!

2900
01:24:19,680 --> 01:24:20,740
Why is she like...

2901
01:24:20,740 --> 01:24:21,980
Oh my gosh, she's echoing.

2902
01:24:22,300 --> 01:24:22,960
I'm coming!

2903
01:24:23,940 --> 01:24:24,300
Okay.

2904
01:24:25,160 --> 01:24:26,360
Wait, where do we go from here?

2905
01:24:26,680 --> 01:24:27,680
Wait, I have to...

2906
01:24:27,680 --> 01:24:28,400
You can use...

2907
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:30,100
You can use that to jump across.

2908
01:24:30,100 --> 01:24:30,920
Wait, you do it.

2909
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:31,880
I don't trust myself.

2910
01:24:33,300 --> 01:24:34,440
But you can only do it once.

2911
01:24:34,720 --> 01:24:35,780
Wait, I don't trust myself.

2912
01:24:35,860 --> 01:24:36,360
You do it.

2913
01:24:37,340 --> 01:24:38,020
Oh my...

2914
01:24:38,020 --> 01:24:38,640
Wait, you do it.

2915
01:24:38,680 --> 01:24:38,900
I'll...

2916
01:24:38,900 --> 01:24:39,660
I'll drop it here.

2917
01:24:40,300 --> 01:24:40,560
Damn.

2918
01:24:42,040 --> 01:24:42,580
You do it.

2919
01:24:42,640 --> 01:24:43,420
I don't trust myself.

2920
01:24:44,240 --> 01:24:44,760
You could...

2921
01:24:44,760 --> 01:24:45,980
You could throw a shelf flick here.

2922
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:47,780
Oh my god.

2923
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:48,940
Do you think I'm gonna hit it?

2924
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:50,760
I think so.

2925
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:51,220
I have faith.

2926
01:24:51,460 --> 01:24:51,700
Gamer.

2927
01:24:54,540 --> 01:24:55,520
Oh, I did it!

2928
01:24:55,780 --> 01:24:56,040
Woo!

2929
01:24:56,820 --> 01:24:57,460
Alright, you first.

2930
01:24:57,500 --> 01:24:58,100
Very nice.

2931
01:25:00,540 --> 01:25:01,280
Oh, shit.

2932
01:25:01,440 --> 01:25:01,880
I'm...

2933
01:25:01,880 --> 01:25:02,780
I'm so cold.

2934
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:04,740
I'm so cold.

2935
01:25:06,520 --> 01:25:07,000
I'm so cold.

2936
01:25:07,580 --> 01:25:09,020
Don't worry, I'm warmed up now.

2937
01:25:11,460 --> 01:25:12,420
Alright, I believe.

2938
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:18,140
I think they're actually...

2939
01:25:18,140 --> 01:25:19,420
They're just running around the capybara.

2940
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:20,300
They're just running around the capybara.

2941
01:25:22,100 --> 01:25:22,780
It's alright.

2942
01:25:23,020 --> 01:25:25,000
They'll write stories about us.

2943
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:26,300
Why do they sound like they're panicking?

2944
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:27,100
I think...

2945
01:25:27,100 --> 01:25:27,940
Capybara's don't induce panic.

2946
01:25:27,940 --> 01:25:29,260
I think something's going...

2947
01:25:29,260 --> 01:25:30,640
I think they might have fucked up.

2948
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,060
It doesn't sound like it's going right.

2949
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:36,540
Whatever's happening over there.

2950
01:25:37,700 --> 01:25:38,220
Got it.

2951
01:25:38,380 --> 01:25:40,300
Have they just decided to die over there?

2952
01:25:40,300 --> 01:25:42,040
I think they're gonna die with the capybaras.

2953
01:25:42,900 --> 01:25:43,060
Yeah.

2954
01:25:45,260 --> 01:25:45,820
Guys!

2955
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:49,080
Yo, are you coming?

2956
01:25:52,160 --> 01:25:53,260
I don't think...

2957
01:25:53,260 --> 01:25:53,800
No, they're just...

2958
01:25:53,800 --> 01:25:54,320
Okay, whatever.

2959
01:25:54,420 --> 01:25:55,400
They've chosen their path.

2960
01:25:55,700 --> 01:25:57,220
I don't think they're coming.

2961
01:25:58,100 --> 01:26:00,520
I don't think they're coming.

2962
01:26:02,620 --> 01:26:04,420
Oh my god, I'm so...

2963
01:26:04,420 --> 01:26:04,580
I'm so...

2964
01:26:04,580 --> 01:26:05,600
Is there anywhere to go up there?

2965
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:07,240
Or are we gonna have to go around the outside again?

2966
01:26:07,380 --> 01:26:08,120
I don't know.

2967
01:26:08,280 --> 01:26:09,100
I'm so lost.

2968
01:26:13,420 --> 01:26:13,860
Alright.

2969
01:26:14,160 --> 01:26:14,640
It sucks here.

2970
01:26:15,380 --> 01:26:15,660
Okay.

2971
01:26:15,900 --> 01:26:17,840
You gotta figure this out, Scoutmaster.

2972
01:26:19,220 --> 01:26:21,600
At least we get a closer look at them.

2973
01:26:23,180 --> 01:26:24,460
I think they're at...

2974
01:26:24,980 --> 01:26:26,760
I think they're gonna live.

2975
01:26:29,640 --> 01:26:32,980
I mean, if you thought that you wouldn't make it all the way to the end.

2976
01:26:33,120 --> 01:26:35,580
Maybe, you know, death by capybara is actually kind of nice.

2977
01:26:35,720 --> 01:26:36,120
You know what?

2978
01:26:36,300 --> 01:26:36,420
Yeah.

2979
01:26:36,640 --> 01:26:37,780
Wait, why am I not doing that?

2980
01:26:37,880 --> 01:26:38,520
Why am I following?

2981
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:41,200
You can come around this way.

2982
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:42,460
I'll try and put an arm up for you.

2983
01:26:42,520 --> 01:26:43,080
Cause it's pretty...

2984
01:26:43,080 --> 01:26:43,620
It's pretty tight.

2985
01:26:43,900 --> 01:26:44,220
Okay.

2986
01:26:50,420 --> 01:26:51,360
One more step to the right.

2987
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:52,060
One more step to the right.

2988
01:26:53,380 --> 01:26:53,700
What?!

2989
01:26:53,700 --> 01:26:54,780
Dude, oh my god!

2990
01:26:55,020 --> 01:26:55,560
Oh my god!

2991
01:26:55,680 --> 01:26:57,240
That was so fucking crazy!

2992
01:26:57,240 --> 01:26:58,440
I can...

2993
01:26:58,440 --> 01:26:59,620
Don't fuck on that!

2994
01:26:59,800 --> 01:27:00,560
That's fucking adrenaline!

2995
01:27:00,960 --> 01:27:01,680
Holy shit!

2996
01:27:01,880 --> 01:27:02,120
You did it!

2997
01:27:02,340 --> 01:27:03,020
You did it!

2998
01:27:03,020 --> 01:27:03,240
I did it!

2999
01:27:03,380 --> 01:27:04,040
I'm gaming!

3000
01:27:04,980 --> 01:27:05,860
The adrenaline!

3001
01:27:07,680 --> 01:27:08,620
Oh, this one sucks.

3002
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:09,080
Hold on.

3003
01:27:09,260 --> 01:27:10,040
Let me go back.

3004
01:27:10,440 --> 01:27:10,880
Okay.

3005
01:27:12,160 --> 01:27:13,860
Wait, I don't think this is right.

3006
01:27:15,120 --> 01:27:16,380
This is fucked.

3007
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:17,600
This whole thing is fucked.

3008
01:27:17,740 --> 01:27:18,880
I think we are not supposed to go...

3009
01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:20,540
Maybe the capybara's with the right choice.

3010
01:27:21,060 --> 01:27:22,900
Yeah, the capybara's were the right choice.

3011
01:27:23,880 --> 01:27:24,640
Hey, kids!

3012
01:27:25,080 --> 01:27:25,700
Hey, guys!

3013
01:27:28,340 --> 01:27:29,720
Do we have any pitons left?

3014
01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:30,340
I don't think we do.

3015
01:27:30,580 --> 01:27:30,740
No.

3016
01:27:31,380 --> 01:27:32,500
No, I don't.

3017
01:27:36,760 --> 01:27:37,940
I am scared.

3018
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:38,740
Oh, this sucks.

3019
01:27:39,300 --> 01:27:40,200
Oh, this sucks.

3020
01:27:40,440 --> 01:27:41,520
Wait, there's no cover.

3021
01:27:41,860 --> 01:27:42,840
Wait, are we gonna freeze?

3022
01:27:43,280 --> 01:27:44,540
Do you still have the chain launcher?

3023
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:46,500
No, that's when I die.

3024
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:48,640
Oh, unfortunate.

3025
01:27:50,920 --> 01:27:52,200
I'm gonna heat up.

3026
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:54,360
It's okay.

3027
01:27:54,360 --> 01:27:55,640
I have a heat pass.

3028
01:27:55,920 --> 01:27:56,200
It hurts.

3029
01:27:56,440 --> 01:27:57,480
It hurts so bad.

3030
01:27:57,560 --> 01:27:58,120
It's okay.

3031
01:27:58,240 --> 01:27:58,740
I'm okay.

3032
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:02,100
If we could get to this, it would be alright.

3033
01:28:04,600 --> 01:28:05,900
But I don't think we can make it.

3034
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:07,100
How do we...

3035
01:28:07,100 --> 01:28:07,960
Yeah, I don't think so.

3036
01:28:09,760 --> 01:28:11,780
Are you sure we're supposed to go through this way?

3037
01:28:11,960 --> 01:28:12,840
Maybe we should go down.

3038
01:28:13,220 --> 01:28:17,040
No, there's like multiple pathways you can take, and I think we could have ended up on one that's not great.

3039
01:28:17,040 --> 01:28:18,260
Yeah.

3040
01:28:19,260 --> 01:28:20,300
Wait, do you want...

3041
01:28:20,300 --> 01:28:21,680
Maybe you get the lollipop.

3042
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:26,800
Lime?

3043
01:28:28,340 --> 01:28:29,700
Lime?

3044
01:28:36,590 --> 01:28:37,430
Lime?

3045
01:28:41,190 --> 01:28:42,550
Lime?

3046
01:28:44,470 --> 01:28:45,830
Lime?

3047
01:28:46,330 --> 01:28:46,390
Lime?

3048
01:28:47,850 --> 01:28:49,210
Lime?

3049
01:28:58,210 --> 01:28:58,750
Guys!

3050
01:29:02,950 --> 01:29:04,030
LIFES DEAD!

3051
01:29:05,510 --> 01:29:06,050
LIFES DEAD!

3052
01:29:07,210 --> 01:29:08,150
LIFES DEAD!

3053
01:29:11,930 --> 01:29:12,530
OH NO!

3054
01:29:12,530 --> 01:29:13,090
OH NO!

3055
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:19,900
YEAH!

3056
01:29:20,540 --> 01:29:20,810
YAAAAAA!

3057
01:29:23,180 --> 01:29:25,880
Guys, it's okay, I ate my lollipop before I died.

3058
01:29:33,640 --> 01:29:35,760
Oh no, don't quit so easily.

3059
01:29:36,740 --> 01:29:39,220
Go back to them, Capybara, and I'm here.

3060
01:29:39,220 --> 01:29:43,480
I swear to Floppy, go back to those goddamn cave bars.

3061
01:29:47,540 --> 01:29:49,280
The fog is coming.

3062
01:29:50,480 --> 01:29:51,900
And Doki died, like, right next to me.

3063
01:29:52,100 --> 01:29:52,920
I ate my Isaac.

3064
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:54,900
Yeah, we're both dead.

3065
01:29:56,460 --> 01:29:57,420
It's okay, guys.

3066
01:29:57,620 --> 01:29:59,640
I ate my lollipop before I died.

3067
01:30:00,640 --> 01:30:02,220
I ate my lollipop.

3068
01:30:02,260 --> 01:30:04,200
Wait, wait, why are you guys going to the cappy bar?

3069
01:30:04,460 --> 01:30:05,080
I want to see you.

3070
01:30:05,200 --> 01:30:06,920
If you go around where Snuffy's going, you'll find our bodies and our subs.

3071
01:30:06,920 --> 01:30:08,560
I want to see the cappy bar, Azmin.

3072
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:10,200
Go back, I want to see.

3073
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:14,880
No, I'm not giving you that satisfaction.

3074
01:30:15,420 --> 01:30:16,600
Oh, that's fucked up.

3075
01:30:17,240 --> 01:30:18,700
That's fucked up.

3076
01:30:18,840 --> 01:30:19,560
I'm going to haunt you.

3077
01:30:20,060 --> 01:30:21,820
I guess my backpack is here.

3078
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:22,480
Oh my god.

3079
01:30:23,240 --> 01:30:24,500
Oh, there's Grungle.

3080
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:25,940
There's Grungle Sand.

3081
01:30:27,340 --> 01:30:28,920
Grungle Sand, there he is.

3082
01:30:30,160 --> 01:30:33,060
I mean, it looks like you might be able to climb up there as well.

3083
01:30:33,240 --> 01:30:34,200
You know, if you want to do that.

3084
01:30:34,220 --> 01:30:35,120
No, they are definitely not.

3085
01:30:35,280 --> 01:30:37,200
No, look at Mint's health bar.

3086
01:30:37,200 --> 01:30:40,500
Yeah, there's no way I'm going to make it.

3087
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:43,760
I told you, I think he's going to gamer her way up.

3088
01:30:44,280 --> 01:30:45,440
We can, we can.

3089
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:47,000
No, no, don't give it to me.

3090
01:30:47,240 --> 01:30:47,960
Don't feed it to me.

3091
01:30:48,120 --> 01:30:49,000
Don't waste it on me.

3092
01:30:49,180 --> 01:30:49,840
You look allergic.

3093
01:30:50,660 --> 01:30:51,380
No, please anything.

3094
01:30:52,300 --> 01:30:53,200
Please save it for yourself.

3095
01:30:53,200 --> 01:30:54,460
I don't have my empty pen.

3096
01:30:54,720 --> 01:30:55,760
I don't have it.

3097
01:30:55,760 --> 01:30:57,500
I have, like, almost more than half.

3098
01:30:57,820 --> 01:30:58,220
I'm good.

3099
01:30:58,620 --> 01:31:03,100
No, if you see what we saw on Mint's health bar, you do not want her to have anything.

3100
01:31:03,460 --> 01:31:04,040
I know.

3101
01:31:06,380 --> 01:31:07,160
I don't know.

3102
01:31:07,420 --> 01:31:08,280
Should we go here?

3103
01:31:08,920 --> 01:31:09,420
It's okay.

3104
01:31:09,500 --> 01:31:10,740
Just jump into the lava.

3105
01:31:12,240 --> 01:31:12,680
I'm going to follow you Scoutmaster.

3106
01:31:12,680 --> 01:31:12,920
You're the new Scoutmaster.

3107
01:31:12,920 --> 01:31:17,220
It's like, she's like one year above you and she's now the Scoutmaster.

3108
01:31:22,220 --> 01:31:24,400
Oh, there's a baton on the walls here.

3109
01:31:24,860 --> 01:31:29,180
You can actually climb internally, but it's like, there's cold rocks and stuff.

3110
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:30,480
So, it's like risky.

3111
01:31:30,500 --> 01:31:31,700
I think I see a mushroom.

3112
01:31:32,140 --> 01:31:33,080
Oh, look at that.

3113
01:31:33,220 --> 01:31:34,360
What's that glowing thing?

3114
01:31:36,020 --> 01:31:36,780
Look at that.

3115
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:39,100
Oh, what did you get?

3116
01:31:39,100 --> 01:31:39,220
What did you get?

3117
01:31:40,140 --> 01:31:40,200
Oh my god.

3118
01:31:41,220 --> 01:31:42,700
It was a flashbang, I think.

3119
01:31:42,980 --> 01:31:43,080
Oh my god.

3120
01:31:43,960 --> 01:31:45,420
Because I can't see anything.

3121
01:31:45,420 --> 01:31:46,680
I think I just look blind.

3122
01:31:49,480 --> 01:31:50,900
She's blind now.

3123
01:31:51,360 --> 01:31:51,540
Oh?

3124
01:31:51,540 --> 01:31:52,740
Follow the sound of her voice.

3125
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:53,860
Use echolocation.

3126
01:31:54,780 --> 01:31:55,360
Oh, ah!

3127
01:31:55,820 --> 01:31:56,720
Are you over here?

3128
01:31:57,140 --> 01:31:57,800
Don't go!

3129
01:31:58,020 --> 01:31:58,500
Don't go!

3130
01:31:58,640 --> 01:31:59,540
Don't go!

3131
01:32:03,080 --> 01:32:04,040
I can't...

3132
01:32:04,040 --> 01:32:05,520
I can see your name.

3133
01:32:05,860 --> 01:32:07,100
You look like god.

3134
01:32:09,220 --> 01:32:13,120
I can see nothing but bright lights and you're just radiating behind it.

3135
01:32:13,240 --> 01:32:13,800
You look like a...

3136
01:32:13,800 --> 01:32:15,260
You look like a holy intervention.

3137
01:32:15,760 --> 01:32:17,940
No, I can't make it.

3138
01:32:18,200 --> 01:32:19,580
It's like your guardian angel.

3139
01:32:19,580 --> 01:32:20,140
No, you can't climb that.

3140
01:32:20,980 --> 01:32:22,620
You literally almost...

3141
01:32:22,620 --> 01:32:23,880
Hey, we could've just followed the old thing.

3142
01:32:24,720 --> 01:32:26,240
Oh, there's a suitcase up there.

3143
01:32:26,340 --> 01:32:26,980
It's gonna have stuff.

3144
01:32:27,620 --> 01:32:28,080
Yeah, yeah, there's a suitcase.

3145
01:32:28,080 --> 01:32:31,120
You literally stuffed and you almost walked into lava.

3146
01:32:31,580 --> 01:32:32,560
The right side's less steep.

3147
01:32:34,140 --> 01:32:36,400
It didn't look like that at all for me.

3148
01:32:36,640 --> 01:32:37,580
I must have a street.

3149
01:32:38,820 --> 01:32:39,880
Is this a better idea?

3150
01:32:40,380 --> 01:32:43,300
Oh, you climb the tree to the left and then press on the branch.

3151
01:32:43,700 --> 01:32:44,640
Oh, never mind.

3152
01:32:45,180 --> 01:32:45,800
I made it!

3153
01:32:45,800 --> 01:32:45,920
I made it!

3154
01:32:45,920 --> 01:32:46,260
Wait, what?

3155
01:32:46,840 --> 01:32:47,580
Mint made it!

3156
01:32:47,600 --> 01:32:48,380
Mint made it?

3157
01:32:48,440 --> 01:32:49,540
She barely has anything.

3158
01:32:50,120 --> 01:32:51,300
Yeah, she has nothing.

3159
01:32:51,540 --> 01:32:52,640
How did she make it?

3160
01:32:57,050 --> 01:32:58,510
You got this, Snuffy.

3161
01:32:58,510 --> 01:32:59,530
I believe.

3162
01:33:01,310 --> 01:33:02,990
The scoutmaster left you.

3163
01:33:03,190 --> 01:33:03,530
This is such a bait, dude.

3164
01:33:04,010 --> 01:33:07,190
The scoutmaster left you, but I still believe in you.

3165
01:33:08,290 --> 01:33:09,570
Mint, you're the new scoutmaster.

3166
01:33:11,310 --> 01:33:14,490
I like all the ice rocks hanging out next to the actual lava.

3167
01:33:14,650 --> 01:33:15,630
That seems okay.

3168
01:33:15,890 --> 01:33:17,930
I think this was actually the more correct path.

3169
01:33:19,670 --> 01:33:20,190
There's a hole.

3170
01:33:21,210 --> 01:33:22,370
You can do either.

3171
01:33:22,550 --> 01:33:23,410
I fucking hate internally.

3172
01:33:23,610 --> 01:33:25,690
So internally, like, takes out the storm.

3173
01:33:25,690 --> 01:33:26,150
Oh.

3174
01:33:26,410 --> 01:33:30,470
But then every time you touch those blue rocks, you accumulate freezing points.

3175
01:33:30,850 --> 01:33:33,530
So if you have to, like, run across them or something, it hurt.

3176
01:33:34,030 --> 01:33:34,150
Oh.

3177
01:33:36,190 --> 01:33:36,530
Oh.

3178
01:33:36,530 --> 01:33:37,170
Here, I can think I can make it.

3179
01:33:37,170 --> 01:33:38,810
You can pull the heat pack, though, and do it.

3180
01:33:38,850 --> 01:33:39,990
You can probably make it.

3181
01:33:40,930 --> 01:33:43,710
Well, the problem is, is there anything above this, though?

3182
01:33:43,910 --> 01:33:44,850
I don't think so.

3183
01:33:44,850 --> 01:33:45,770
No, there's not really.

3184
01:33:48,510 --> 01:33:49,370
Go to the left.

3185
01:33:49,490 --> 01:33:50,230
Go to the far left.

3186
01:33:50,310 --> 01:33:51,050
You see what I see?

3187
01:33:52,590 --> 01:33:53,510
There's rocks there.

3188
01:33:54,070 --> 01:33:56,930
And if there's rocks there, that means more climbing.

3189
01:33:57,330 --> 01:33:58,810
Are these good for your soul or bad?

3190
01:33:59,410 --> 01:34:00,570
The, the glowy blue one?

3191
01:34:00,630 --> 01:34:01,850
Oh, that, that is good for your soul.

3192
01:34:02,130 --> 01:34:02,350
Oh!

3193
01:34:02,350 --> 01:34:03,930
That was not good for your soul.

3194
01:34:04,330 --> 01:34:04,890
That was...

3195
01:34:04,890 --> 01:34:05,870
You got burned.

3196
01:34:07,770 --> 01:34:08,590
You are?

3197
01:34:09,590 --> 01:34:10,070
Yeah.

3198
01:34:10,590 --> 01:34:11,370
Too, too hot.

3199
01:34:11,890 --> 01:34:13,190
What does a Grunkle do?

3200
01:34:15,670 --> 01:34:16,670
Is he just there?

3201
01:34:16,950 --> 01:34:17,470
He didn't do anything to you.

3202
01:34:17,590 --> 01:34:17,710
Oh.

3203
01:34:19,250 --> 01:34:21,050
It's just like a little companion.

3204
01:34:23,070 --> 01:34:23,510
Okay.

3205
01:34:23,730 --> 01:34:25,290
This is definitely the right way.

3206
01:34:25,610 --> 01:34:25,950
Yeah, yeah.

3207
01:34:26,110 --> 01:34:26,450
Go, go.

3208
01:34:26,770 --> 01:34:26,910
Definitely.

3209
01:34:27,870 --> 01:34:28,750
I told you guys.

3210
01:34:29,010 --> 01:34:30,070
Wait, but how are you gonna climb that?

3211
01:34:30,470 --> 01:34:30,950
Oh, luggage.

3212
01:34:33,190 --> 01:34:34,110
Oh, there's snaps!

3213
01:34:34,370 --> 01:34:34,650
Eat it!

3214
01:34:35,670 --> 01:34:36,550
Ooh, delicious!

3215
01:34:38,010 --> 01:34:38,950
No, she's not hungry.

3216
01:34:39,090 --> 01:34:39,650
She's not hungry.

3217
01:34:39,690 --> 01:34:40,230
Min's not actually hungry.

3218
01:34:40,450 --> 01:34:40,670
No!

3219
01:34:42,790 --> 01:34:44,710
It was just a little treat.

3220
01:34:45,950 --> 01:34:47,130
It's for your whimsy.

3221
01:34:47,430 --> 01:34:48,350
It's for your...

3222
01:34:48,910 --> 01:34:49,230
It's for your...

3223
01:34:49,230 --> 01:34:50,370
Your happiness meter.

3224
01:34:50,630 --> 01:34:50,950
It's a passive.

3225
01:34:51,270 --> 01:34:52,750
Snuffy's absolutely gonna be that kind of grandma.

3226
01:34:52,830 --> 01:34:56,750
Where you visit, and then, like, you're trying to leave, and she's like, Oh, take these with you!

3227
01:34:56,850 --> 01:34:57,670
Oh, and these as well!

3228
01:34:57,670 --> 01:34:59,470
And then she, like, finds, like, I don't know.

3229
01:34:59,530 --> 01:35:00,650
She overfeeds you.

3230
01:35:01,130 --> 01:35:02,610
And she's like, you should take some of these as well.

3231
01:35:02,730 --> 01:35:05,090
And then a snack for the road, and you can use this for your dinner.

3232
01:35:06,670 --> 01:35:07,890
That's a nice grandma.

3233
01:35:07,890 --> 01:35:09,230
I can see the capi bar over here.

3234
01:35:10,210 --> 01:35:10,570
Oh, shoot.

3235
01:35:10,870 --> 01:35:10,930
Uh-oh.

3236
01:35:11,210 --> 01:35:11,590
Uh-oh.

3237
01:35:12,470 --> 01:35:12,970
I'm safe.

3238
01:35:13,970 --> 01:35:14,850
Snuffy isn't.

3239
01:35:14,990 --> 01:35:16,230
Oh, she's safe now.

3240
01:35:17,290 --> 01:35:17,770
I'm good, I'm good.

3241
01:35:17,770 --> 01:35:18,350
Come to me!

3242
01:35:18,990 --> 01:35:19,990
It's good here.

3243
01:35:20,250 --> 01:35:21,050
Be careful, though.

3244
01:35:21,570 --> 01:35:23,030
If I fall, I'll die.

3245
01:35:23,050 --> 01:35:23,370
If I fall, I'll die.

3246
01:35:23,750 --> 01:35:24,390
No, you won't.

3247
01:35:24,490 --> 01:35:25,110
You'll be fine.

3248
01:35:27,030 --> 01:35:28,050
We'll see about that.

3249
01:35:28,050 --> 01:35:29,150
You'll be so healthy.

3250
01:35:29,510 --> 01:35:30,970
Why is the grunkle so heavy, actually?

3251
01:35:31,310 --> 01:35:32,170
I'm gonna get rid of it.

3252
01:35:32,790 --> 01:35:33,290
No!

3253
01:35:33,290 --> 01:35:35,210
Do it!

3254
01:35:35,210 --> 01:35:35,970
Do it!

3255
01:35:35,970 --> 01:35:36,850
Do it into the volcano!

3256
01:35:37,570 --> 01:35:38,130
Yes!

3257
01:35:38,810 --> 01:35:39,250
Yes!

3258
01:35:40,010 --> 01:35:42,590
I don't even have anything in my inventory!

3259
01:35:43,070 --> 01:35:45,490
I lost, like, ten pounds in my inventory.

3260
01:35:46,570 --> 01:35:48,470
I like how Snuffy's like, no!

3261
01:35:49,110 --> 01:35:52,150
That was the weight of your heart shriveling into a prune.

3262
01:35:52,790 --> 01:35:53,990
Do you see my health?

3263
01:35:54,270 --> 01:35:55,510
There is no...

3264
01:35:55,510 --> 01:35:57,590
You couldn't give it to Snuffy!

3265
01:35:57,890 --> 01:35:58,770
She's not gonna give it to Snuffy!

3266
01:35:58,770 --> 01:36:00,250
Snuffy is supposed to be made!

3267
01:36:00,810 --> 01:36:01,590
Yes, do it.

3268
01:36:01,630 --> 01:36:02,750
Oh, the snowstorm's gone.

3269
01:36:02,750 --> 01:36:03,850
Okay, I'm gonna jump over.

3270
01:36:03,850 --> 01:36:05,290
Throw the ring in the volcano!

3271
01:36:05,750 --> 01:36:06,110
Do it!

3272
01:36:07,830 --> 01:36:08,310
I...

3273
01:36:08,310 --> 01:36:08,910
It's like...

3274
01:36:08,910 --> 01:36:10,570
It's like the ring from Lord of the Rings.

3275
01:36:11,050 --> 01:36:13,750
Yeah, but throwing it in the volcano was the evil decision.

3276
01:36:14,050 --> 01:36:16,590
You know, you've cursed the entire run because you let him die.

3277
01:36:17,230 --> 01:36:19,210
This run has already been cursed.

3278
01:36:19,370 --> 01:36:21,570
Do you really think you two are gonna make it to the top?

3279
01:36:21,930 --> 01:36:23,190
Do you really think?

3280
01:36:25,330 --> 01:36:28,090
You guys were like, my precious Grungle.

3281
01:36:28,530 --> 01:36:30,050
You just couldn't see...

3282
01:36:30,050 --> 01:36:30,530
It's Grungle!

3283
01:36:30,610 --> 01:36:31,310
Yes, it is.

3284
01:36:31,390 --> 01:36:32,090
Who the fire!

3285
01:36:32,410 --> 01:36:33,610
You couldn't see...

3286
01:36:34,150 --> 01:36:34,670
The...

3287
01:36:34,670 --> 01:36:35,450
The truth!

3288
01:36:35,450 --> 01:36:37,190
I showed it...

3289
01:36:37,190 --> 01:36:38,070
I showed it to you.

3290
01:36:40,230 --> 01:36:41,710
I'm following snum...

3291
01:36:41,710 --> 01:36:42,230
Snum vision?

3292
01:36:42,430 --> 01:36:42,690
Thank you.

3293
01:36:42,930 --> 01:36:43,770
Snum vision!

3294
01:36:44,190 --> 01:36:45,710
I mean, snum...

3295
01:36:45,710 --> 01:36:46,390
Snum nation?

3296
01:36:46,530 --> 01:36:48,070
You're pretty good in the snow, so...

3297
01:36:48,070 --> 01:36:48,390
Yeah.

3298
01:36:49,930 --> 01:36:50,650
All right.

3299
01:36:50,670 --> 01:36:52,730
Oh, there's the blizzard.

3300
01:36:54,090 --> 01:36:54,810
It's actually...

3301
01:36:54,810 --> 01:36:55,590
You're making good progress.

3302
01:36:55,750 --> 01:36:56,990
You found a better part of the mountain to climb.

3303
01:36:57,210 --> 01:36:57,730
I believe in you.

3304
01:36:57,950 --> 01:36:58,430
That means...

3305
01:36:58,430 --> 01:36:58,570
Wait.

3306
01:36:58,690 --> 01:37:00,550
Is it a procedural generated?

3307
01:37:01,310 --> 01:37:02,050
I have a rope.

3308
01:37:02,170 --> 01:37:02,850
Actually, hold on.

3309
01:37:02,890 --> 01:37:03,870
Let me put this into your...

3310
01:37:03,870 --> 01:37:04,310
It's...

3311
01:37:04,310 --> 01:37:05,790
It's a new map every day.

3312
01:37:06,150 --> 01:37:06,430
Okay.

3313
01:37:06,670 --> 01:37:07,850
But it's the same map each time.

3314
01:37:07,950 --> 01:37:09,230
So if we tried it again, it would be the same map.

3315
01:37:09,230 --> 01:37:10,110
Yeah, so we'll know...

3316
01:37:10,110 --> 01:37:10,990
We'll know how...

3317
01:37:10,990 --> 01:37:11,910
That it'll be this way.

3318
01:37:12,850 --> 01:37:13,210
Yeah, yeah.

3319
01:37:14,450 --> 01:37:14,810
Okay.

3320
01:37:15,250 --> 01:37:15,550
Okay.

3321
01:37:15,810 --> 01:37:16,490
Wait, so then like...

3322
01:37:16,490 --> 01:37:18,990
They should just die, so then we know how to do this.

3323
01:37:19,550 --> 01:37:19,850
And then...

3324
01:37:19,850 --> 01:37:21,130
And then either...

3325
01:37:21,130 --> 01:37:21,930
I think...

3326
01:37:22,590 --> 01:37:23,030
Oh.

3327
01:37:23,370 --> 01:37:23,510
Oh.

3328
01:37:24,150 --> 01:37:25,970
You just tell your friends to just die.

3329
01:37:26,250 --> 01:37:27,310
Just do the...

3330
01:37:27,310 --> 01:37:27,430
Just do the...

3331
01:37:27,430 --> 01:37:28,210
Just jump out.

3332
01:37:28,490 --> 01:37:29,010
Just jump out.

3333
01:37:29,530 --> 01:37:29,690
It's right there.

3334
01:37:30,330 --> 01:37:31,090
It's right there.

3335
01:37:32,410 --> 01:37:34,750
It's such an easier decision to make.

3336
01:37:34,890 --> 01:37:36,410
Don't you guys like the easy toys?

3337
01:37:37,490 --> 01:37:38,470
Yeah, I love e...

3338
01:37:38,470 --> 01:37:38,830
Oh, no.

3339
01:37:39,030 --> 01:37:39,350
Uh-oh.

3340
01:37:40,030 --> 01:37:41,310
Right here, right here, right here.

3341
01:37:41,390 --> 01:37:41,830
Maybe?

3342
01:37:42,550 --> 01:37:43,570
Just do a flip.

3343
01:37:43,810 --> 01:37:43,870
Nope.

3344
01:37:44,090 --> 01:37:44,470
Nevermind.

3345
01:37:44,470 --> 01:37:44,590
I'm dying.

3346
01:37:44,590 --> 01:37:45,690
No, I'm dying.

3347
01:37:45,690 --> 01:37:46,330
Let's do it though.

3348
01:37:47,710 --> 01:37:47,950
Oh gosh.

3349
01:37:48,330 --> 01:37:48,590
Yeah!

3350
01:37:50,150 --> 01:37:50,790
Yeah!

3351
01:37:50,790 --> 01:37:50,810
Yeah!

3352
01:37:58,240 --> 01:37:59,200
She's dead.

3353
01:38:00,240 --> 01:38:02,480
It's just you, Snow.

3354
01:38:03,100 --> 01:38:04,620
It's just you.

3355
01:38:19,210 --> 01:38:20,090
Oh,

3356
01:38:24,820 --> 01:38:26,020
new hat.

3357
01:38:27,900 --> 01:38:28,780
Yay!

3358
01:38:32,300 --> 01:38:34,880
And then there was none.

3359
01:38:35,420 --> 01:38:37,540
Oh shit, my monitor died.

3360
01:38:38,520 --> 01:38:39,780
That's not good.

3361
01:38:42,140 --> 01:38:42,660
Oh.

3362
01:38:45,680 --> 01:38:46,200
Ooh.

3363
01:38:46,420 --> 01:38:46,660
Ooh.

3364
01:38:46,660 --> 01:38:46,700
Ooh.

3365
01:38:46,700 --> 01:38:47,380
That's not good.

3366
01:38:50,900 --> 01:38:52,880
My monitor fully...

3367
01:38:52,880 --> 01:38:56,120
I told you, you throw bing bong in your ears.

3368
01:38:56,780 --> 01:38:56,800
Why are...

3369
01:38:56,800 --> 01:38:57,320
Why are...

3370
01:38:57,320 --> 01:38:58,480
Why do you look like that?

3371
01:38:59,380 --> 01:39:00,460
Hey guys.

3372
01:39:01,640 --> 01:39:02,360
Oh.

3373
01:39:02,560 --> 01:39:03,560
Say that about your friends.

3374
01:39:04,460 --> 01:39:04,860
Oh.

3375
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:05,820
Oh.

3376
01:39:06,240 --> 01:39:06,960
Oh.

3377
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:08,480
Oh.

3378
01:39:09,460 --> 01:39:10,180
Oh.

3379
01:39:10,180 --> 01:39:10,960
This is not good.

3380
01:39:13,720 --> 01:39:14,440
Oh.

3381
01:39:18,080 --> 01:39:18,260
Oh.

3382
01:39:18,260 --> 01:39:18,420
Oh.

3383
01:39:18,780 --> 01:39:18,820
Oh.

3384
01:39:18,820 --> 01:39:18,960
Oh.

3385
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:18,980
Oh.

3386
01:39:18,980 --> 01:39:19,020
Oh.

3387
01:39:19,020 --> 01:39:19,220
Oh.

3388
01:39:19,760 --> 01:39:20,480
Oh.

3389
01:39:20,780 --> 01:39:22,400
My monitor's not good.

3390
01:39:22,880 --> 01:39:23,600
Dude.

3391
01:39:25,380 --> 01:39:26,820
My monitor's dead.

3392
01:39:26,840 --> 01:39:27,340
You dead?

3393
01:39:27,960 --> 01:39:28,320
No!

3394
01:39:29,740 --> 01:39:30,220
No!

3395
01:39:30,620 --> 01:39:31,320
Oh shit.

3396
01:39:31,880 --> 01:39:32,600
Oh shit.

3397
01:39:32,760 --> 01:39:32,960
Sorry.

3398
01:39:33,300 --> 01:39:33,320
Oh no.

3399
01:39:33,460 --> 01:39:33,760
Sorry.

3400
01:39:33,820 --> 01:39:36,080
I was trying to go on YouTube to the...

3401
01:39:36,080 --> 01:39:36,800
Oh my god.

3402
01:39:37,100 --> 01:39:37,720
Oh my god.

3403
01:39:37,900 --> 01:39:38,740
I was trying to go on YouTube.

3404
01:39:38,740 --> 01:39:41,940
My PC's on fire.

3405
01:39:42,080 --> 01:39:43,760
My PC's on fire.

3406
01:39:44,640 --> 01:39:48,020
Computer might be...

3407
01:39:48,740 --> 01:39:49,480
Donkey!

3408
01:39:50,640 --> 01:39:51,220
Help!

3409
01:39:59,580 --> 01:40:00,300
Hello?

3410
01:40:01,580 --> 01:40:02,320
Hello?

3411
01:40:02,740 --> 01:40:03,300
I'm back.

3412
01:40:04,100 --> 01:40:05,120
What happened?

3413
01:40:05,920 --> 01:40:07,980
What happened to me?

3414
01:40:09,140 --> 01:40:11,260
What happened to me?

3415
01:40:15,060 --> 01:40:21,060
My main monitor died and then like everything... I just hear like...

3416
01:40:21,060 --> 01:40:26,400
Like everyone cutting in and out and then like everyone just kept looping.

3417
01:40:26,760 --> 01:40:33,720
All I heard was just meant laughing and it was the same laugh over and over and over again.

3418
01:40:33,720 --> 01:40:35,040
It never stopped.

3419
01:40:35,520 --> 01:40:38,300
And then I forced quit my game.

3420
01:40:38,540 --> 01:40:40,320
It was like I was living in hell.

3421
01:40:40,400 --> 01:40:41,760
That sounds like a nightmare.

3422
01:40:42,480 --> 01:40:45,760
Yeah, it was... It was... It was...

3423
01:40:45,760 --> 01:40:49,300
What did I... She was the one that threw it into the hole!

3424
01:40:49,500 --> 01:40:50,680
What did I do?

3425
01:40:51,220 --> 01:40:52,200
Whip, whip, watch me nae nae.

3426
01:40:53,260 --> 01:40:55,440
Whip, whip, nae nae.

3427
01:40:57,520 --> 01:40:59,080
Whip, whip.

3428
01:40:59,460 --> 01:41:01,440
I need sound guy to fix this.

3429
01:41:01,580 --> 01:41:02,840
I taught her to whip and nae nae.

3430
01:41:03,720 --> 01:41:06,140
I need a... Am I the same character?

3431
01:41:06,740 --> 01:41:08,060
Good, I'm still angry.

3432
01:41:08,320 --> 01:41:09,640
I'm still...

3433
01:41:09,640 --> 01:41:11,960
I need sound guy to help me again.

3434
01:41:12,140 --> 01:41:13,520
Everything reset itself.

3435
01:41:15,700 --> 01:41:18,360
How do you... What the fuck did you do?

3436
01:41:20,540 --> 01:41:21,740
Wait, what did you do?

3437
01:41:22,780 --> 01:41:24,220
I was doing the lawnmower.

3438
01:41:24,400 --> 01:41:24,860
The dance.

3439
01:41:28,500 --> 01:41:29,740
Oh, you have a new hat!

3440
01:41:30,620 --> 01:41:32,140
Vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom.

3441
01:41:33,480 --> 01:41:34,820
I have a new hat.

3442
01:41:36,360 --> 01:41:36,980
Oh, yeah?

3443
01:41:37,280 --> 01:41:38,240
Oh, nice, yeah.

3444
01:41:38,440 --> 01:41:38,520
Oh, nice, yeah.

3445
01:41:38,520 --> 01:41:39,060
Yeah, look at my hat.

3446
01:41:39,180 --> 01:41:39,840
Oh, I like your hat.

3447
01:41:40,180 --> 01:41:41,500
Yeah, this is my hat.

3448
01:41:42,640 --> 01:41:45,220
Well, I don't like your hat either.

3449
01:41:45,740 --> 01:41:49,200
If you bring the bugle to the capybaras and play it to them, you get a hat.

3450
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:50,380
Really?

3451
01:41:50,660 --> 01:41:51,560
What kind of hat?

3452
01:41:55,620 --> 01:41:56,100
Yeah.

3453
01:41:56,100 --> 01:41:56,140
Yeah.

3454
01:41:56,760 --> 01:41:57,980
Oh my god, it's happening.

3455
01:41:58,320 --> 01:41:58,960
I didn't know that.

3456
01:41:59,060 --> 01:41:59,600
It's happening.

3457
01:41:59,760 --> 01:42:00,580
Everything paused.

3458
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:01,960
Oh my god.

3459
01:42:02,200 --> 01:42:02,600
Wait.

3460
01:42:02,800 --> 01:42:03,840
Is your computer dying?

3461
01:42:04,820 --> 01:42:05,800
Oh my god.

3462
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:06,860
I'm not okay.

3463
01:42:07,160 --> 01:42:09,860
There's no way Peek is gonna destroy my PC.

3464
01:42:11,080 --> 01:42:13,080
Is your framerate capped?

3465
01:42:13,080 --> 01:42:13,700
Yeah.

3466
01:42:13,720 --> 01:42:14,280
It was.

3467
01:42:14,380 --> 01:42:14,540
Yeah.

3468
01:42:14,740 --> 01:42:15,300
I capped it!

3469
01:42:15,540 --> 01:42:15,940
It was.

3470
01:42:16,140 --> 01:42:16,540
No.

3471
01:42:16,720 --> 01:42:17,720
I capped it at 200.

3472
01:42:17,920 --> 01:42:19,240
I'm gonna cap it to 144.

3473
01:42:21,940 --> 01:42:23,060
I'll add two hundred.

3474
01:42:23,440 --> 01:42:27,620
OK, you shut the fuck up right now, you shut- Yeah, you shut up.

3475
01:42:27,680 --> 01:42:28,580
You shut up.

3476
01:42:28,680 --> 01:42:29,980
You shut up, you shut up.

3477
01:42:30,300 --> 01:42:32,600
You shut up right now, no 섞ing you in the locker.

3478
01:42:46,080 --> 01:42:46,600
No!

3479
01:42:46,600 --> 01:42:47,640
Let her go!

3480
01:42:55,320 --> 01:42:57,900
Alright, wait... Yeah, wait, I need to...

3481
01:42:57,900 --> 01:43:00,920
If my sound guide lets me know if everyone's volume...

3482
01:43:00,920 --> 01:43:04,440
Apparently when you rejoin a session, it resets your volume sliders.

3483
01:43:04,700 --> 01:43:05,280
It does, yeah.

3484
01:43:05,520 --> 01:43:05,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3485
01:43:07,360 --> 01:43:11,900
Yeah, so I need to know if everything... I need to know if all the volume's okay.

3486
01:43:11,900 --> 01:43:13,500
Oh my god.

3487
01:43:13,880 --> 01:43:15,200
I'm ready though, I'm ready.

3488
01:43:15,320 --> 01:43:16,180
Go on vacation.

3489
01:43:17,200 --> 01:43:18,540
Come on, vacation!

3490
01:43:19,060 --> 01:43:21,300
Demon's doing the splits on the elevator!

3491
01:43:21,720 --> 01:43:22,140
Wee!

3492
01:43:22,760 --> 01:43:23,400
Wee!

3493
01:43:24,680 --> 01:43:25,960
Oh my god!

3494
01:43:27,340 --> 01:43:28,460
So are you!

3495
01:43:28,760 --> 01:43:29,380
Let's go!

3496
01:43:31,040 --> 01:43:33,000
They call me the man of steel.

3497
01:43:36,620 --> 01:43:37,540
I'm ready.

3498
01:43:38,040 --> 01:43:38,940
I'm ready.

3499
01:43:39,380 --> 01:43:40,800
I'm locked in.

3500
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:43,060
I'm boarding my ticket.

3501
01:43:45,020 --> 01:43:45,860
Wait.

3502
01:43:46,720 --> 01:43:48,180
He's doing the thing.

3503
01:43:50,040 --> 01:43:50,520
Yeah!

3504
01:43:59,130 --> 01:43:59,970
Yippee!

3505
01:44:01,050 --> 01:44:01,830
I'm crying.

3506
01:44:02,110 --> 01:44:02,810
I'm alive.

3507
01:44:03,830 --> 01:44:05,090
We're all alive.

3508
01:44:05,670 --> 01:44:06,690
Alright, skarts.

3509
01:44:06,870 --> 01:44:09,110
Let me double check something real quick.

3510
01:44:09,270 --> 01:44:10,270
Give me the bugle.

3511
01:44:12,250 --> 01:44:14,570
It's always about the bugle.

3512
01:44:15,370 --> 01:44:16,790
Give me the bugle.

3513
01:44:17,070 --> 01:44:18,230
Give it to me.

3514
01:44:18,890 --> 01:44:20,950
Maybe that's why you called it the bungle.

3515
01:44:21,130 --> 01:44:23,170
That's only one letter away from bugle.

3516
01:44:23,410 --> 01:44:24,770
You were just thinking about your bugle.

3517
01:44:24,770 --> 01:44:25,490
Oh, that's true.

3518
01:44:26,730 --> 01:44:27,250
Maybe...

3519
01:44:27,250 --> 01:44:28,370
Oh, there it is.

3520
01:44:28,450 --> 01:44:29,070
There's Bing Bong.

3521
01:44:30,210 --> 01:44:32,450
I think he'd get a hat if you take him to the top, too.

3522
01:44:33,610 --> 01:44:35,330
Alright, well, we have two missions, Scout.

3523
01:44:35,590 --> 01:44:35,970
Thank you.

3524
01:44:36,330 --> 01:44:36,330
Alright.

3525
01:44:37,350 --> 01:44:39,670
Take Grunko's dad to the top.

3526
01:44:40,090 --> 01:44:40,630
You take him, Snuffy.

3527
01:44:40,990 --> 01:44:41,550
I got food.

3528
01:44:42,050 --> 01:44:43,910
I want to grab the food, too.

3529
01:44:44,010 --> 01:44:44,890
Wait, who has the backpack?

3530
01:44:46,230 --> 01:44:46,570
Me!

3531
01:44:47,610 --> 01:44:48,370
Alright, let's go.

3532
01:44:48,590 --> 01:44:49,690
We know the way now!

3533
01:44:50,430 --> 01:44:52,390
Alright, lead the way, Scoutmaster!

3534
01:44:53,230 --> 01:44:54,110
Lead the way!

3535
01:44:55,150 --> 01:44:56,850
I'm running, I'm running, I'm running.

3536
01:44:57,830 --> 01:44:59,730
Alright, I'm putting... Wait, why do we need a compass?

3537
01:44:59,970 --> 01:45:01,270
I thought we don't need a compass.

3538
01:45:01,990 --> 01:45:03,910
We don't need the compass, I don't think.

3539
01:45:04,610 --> 01:45:05,030
Boom!

3540
01:45:05,850 --> 01:45:07,530
You take the compass...

3541
01:45:07,530 --> 01:45:10,590
Oh, the compass...

3542
01:45:12,730 --> 01:45:14,950
We don't need the compass where we're going!

3543
01:45:15,430 --> 01:45:15,910
Scout!

3544
01:45:22,120 --> 01:45:23,660
My lung capacity is...

3545
01:45:24,420 --> 01:45:24,900
Oh...

3546
01:45:24,900 --> 01:45:26,860
Oh, there's that floating guy again.

3547
01:45:27,160 --> 01:45:28,920
Wait, so it's the same map now, right?

3548
01:45:28,940 --> 01:45:30,820
Yeah, it's the same map.

3549
01:45:34,960 --> 01:45:35,360
No.

3550
01:45:35,860 --> 01:45:37,320
I... I trust in Lime.

3551
01:45:38,980 --> 01:45:39,960
Don't worry, I have this.

3552
01:45:40,400 --> 01:45:40,460
No.

3553
01:45:41,780 --> 01:45:42,380
Yeah, exactly.

3554
01:45:42,860 --> 01:45:43,220
Put it on the floor!

3555
01:45:44,340 --> 01:45:44,620
Yeah!

3556
01:45:46,100 --> 01:45:46,940
I have a little...

3557
01:45:46,940 --> 01:45:48,460
And I drew it on the floor!

3558
01:45:49,240 --> 01:45:49,440
Ow!

3559
01:45:49,880 --> 01:45:50,060
Ah!

3560
01:45:50,740 --> 01:45:51,020
Ah!

3561
01:45:51,520 --> 01:45:52,520
What happened to me?

3562
01:45:53,480 --> 01:45:55,200
Wait, Lime, I'll put it in your backpack.

3563
01:45:55,320 --> 01:45:55,940
Oh, yeah, me too.

3564
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:57,200
I'll put this in the backpack, too.

3565
01:45:57,540 --> 01:45:58,020
Now, I think.

3566
01:45:58,420 --> 01:45:58,760
Oh, okay.

3567
01:45:58,760 --> 01:46:01,140
Yeah, they're, like, super heavy for what they are.

3568
01:46:02,200 --> 01:46:02,540
Yeah.

3569
01:46:03,580 --> 01:46:04,260
I just...

3570
01:46:04,260 --> 01:46:05,540
You put that shit in my backpack, didn't you?

3571
01:46:05,760 --> 01:46:06,060
No.

3572
01:46:06,780 --> 01:46:07,120
No.

3573
01:46:07,380 --> 01:46:07,720
No.

3574
01:46:08,260 --> 01:46:09,080
Yeah, I believe you.

3575
01:46:09,260 --> 01:46:11,480
I mean, the number went off to show that you did, but okay.

3576
01:46:12,340 --> 01:46:12,680
No.

3577
01:46:13,020 --> 01:46:14,300
Let me check, let me check for you.

3578
01:46:14,300 --> 01:46:16,180
Maybe you went through, like, a growth spring.

3579
01:46:16,320 --> 01:46:17,360
Yeah, maybe you grew...

3580
01:46:17,360 --> 01:46:17,740
at pu...

3581
01:46:17,740 --> 01:46:18,600
second puberty.

3582
01:46:20,460 --> 01:46:21,900
You gained an extra...

3583
01:46:21,900 --> 01:46:22,820
Wait, did you check?

3584
01:46:23,860 --> 01:46:24,780
Yeah, I did.

3585
01:46:27,340 --> 01:46:30,020
Yeah, did you get more in my fucking backpack, man?

3586
01:46:32,500 --> 01:46:33,660
Did she check?

3587
01:46:34,500 --> 01:46:35,680
No, I just went to check.

3588
01:46:37,840 --> 01:46:38,520
What do you...

3589
01:46:38,520 --> 01:46:39,740
Why did I get it?

3590
01:46:40,080 --> 01:46:41,840
She was the one that put it in!

3591
01:46:42,920 --> 01:46:45,020
It was her fun!

3592
01:46:45,660 --> 01:46:49,000
And it's nothing for when my fucking backpack is low, because I still have fun!

3593
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:53,200
Skull Master, then put your coconut in your backpack!

3594
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:55,240
It wasn't me!

3595
01:46:56,260 --> 01:46:57,500
Wait, you guys need to look at this.

3596
01:46:57,600 --> 01:46:58,400
There's something of...

3597
01:46:58,400 --> 01:47:00,180
This whole map is very obscure.

3598
01:47:00,640 --> 01:47:00,840
What?

3599
01:47:01,120 --> 01:47:02,660
Why is there a mushroom growing on this area?

3600
01:47:03,040 --> 01:47:04,920
I like the mushrooms growing on this area.

3601
01:47:05,540 --> 01:47:06,920
Those are the roots that I...

3602
01:47:06,920 --> 01:47:07,400
That was the...

3603
01:47:07,400 --> 01:47:08,940
The roots from before.

3604
01:47:09,360 --> 01:47:11,640
I really got some home growing in here.

3605
01:47:11,640 --> 01:47:12,740
Are you safe?

3606
01:47:13,800 --> 01:47:14,560
Are you safe?

3607
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:15,000
Are you tired?

3608
01:47:15,180 --> 01:47:15,740
Are you okay?

3609
01:47:16,380 --> 01:47:17,720
Okay, let's drop, guys.

3610
01:47:18,960 --> 01:47:19,100
Alright.

3611
01:47:20,280 --> 01:47:21,020
It's safe.

3612
01:47:21,340 --> 01:47:21,840
Is it?

3613
01:47:21,860 --> 01:47:22,860
Maybe if you eat one.

3614
01:47:23,900 --> 01:47:25,500
Maybe just one.

3615
01:47:25,960 --> 01:47:26,540
Just one.

3616
01:47:26,940 --> 01:47:27,400
Yeah.

3617
01:47:28,620 --> 01:47:30,220
Just a little poison as a treat.

3618
01:47:31,820 --> 01:47:33,980
I think I have a better tolerance now.

3619
01:47:34,320 --> 01:47:35,140
Yeah, like you...

3620
01:47:35,980 --> 01:47:37,280
I've never seen that!

3621
01:47:37,280 --> 01:47:38,820
Once a day you become a man.

3622
01:47:38,940 --> 01:47:40,320
I saw an art...

3623
01:47:40,320 --> 01:47:47,780
I saw like a tweet where someone was like, I shot myself in the leg every day until I can...

3624
01:47:47,780 --> 01:47:47,980
Oh yeah.

3625
01:47:48,040 --> 01:47:49,980
I can make my skin bulletproof.

3626
01:47:50,520 --> 01:47:52,500
And then I see that tweet.

3627
01:47:53,280 --> 01:47:54,820
Nothing to lose.

3628
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:55,700
Hang on.

3629
01:47:56,480 --> 01:47:56,960
Thickman.

3630
01:47:57,340 --> 01:47:58,300
A scout cookie.

3631
01:47:58,940 --> 01:47:59,540
Thickman!

3632
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:00,300
Woah!

3633
01:48:01,360 --> 01:48:02,480
I got energy drinks.

3634
01:48:02,480 --> 01:48:04,400
Scout cookies are not allowed in Canada.

3635
01:48:04,780 --> 01:48:06,220
It's an American only.

3636
01:48:06,560 --> 01:48:08,240
It's an American only thing.

3637
01:48:09,260 --> 01:48:09,560
Woah!

3638
01:48:09,560 --> 01:48:10,380
Wait, we need those.

3639
01:48:10,820 --> 01:48:11,360
Wait, I don't...

3640
01:48:11,360 --> 01:48:12,680
Did you just use the energy drink?

3641
01:48:13,200 --> 01:48:14,400
Was I not supposed to?

3642
01:48:14,640 --> 01:48:16,520
Wait, are you holding the cookies?

3643
01:48:16,720 --> 01:48:17,240
It's fine.

3644
01:48:17,720 --> 01:48:19,140
Oh, I'm tired now.

3645
01:48:19,580 --> 01:48:20,380
To eat B.

3646
01:48:23,280 --> 01:48:25,380
Yeah, you can microdose on...

3647
01:48:25,380 --> 01:48:28,960
Apparently this guy was trying to microdose on bullets, and then he like...

3648
01:48:28,960 --> 01:48:34,120
tried to... and then he like upgraded to a really strong bullet, and then he went to the hospital.

3649
01:48:38,560 --> 01:48:42,860
No, he was like, I had to stop, so I hope someone else continues my research.

3650
01:48:44,640 --> 01:48:46,020
More energy drink.

3651
01:48:48,300 --> 01:48:50,720
You have to stop shooting himself in the leg.

3652
01:48:54,960 --> 01:48:58,400
Wait, you're the ones that were supposed to remember for us.

3653
01:48:59,980 --> 01:49:01,700
Wait, I'm gonna...

3654
01:49:02,260 --> 01:49:05,460
I'm eating this coconut so I can keep the...

3655
01:49:05,460 --> 01:49:06,100
Yeah, me too.

3656
01:49:06,660 --> 01:49:11,940
To be fair, the first two mountains were like super easy, and then there was like a...

3657
01:49:11,940 --> 01:49:14,180
some difficulty spike for some reason.

3658
01:49:15,280 --> 01:49:16,000
Uh-oh.

3659
01:49:16,360 --> 01:49:16,620
Wait.

3660
01:49:17,220 --> 01:49:17,600
Uh-oh.

3661
01:49:17,820 --> 01:49:19,340
I remember we crossed the bridge.

3662
01:49:19,780 --> 01:49:21,240
We just gotta find the bridge.

3663
01:49:21,660 --> 01:49:21,840
Yeah.

3664
01:49:22,380 --> 01:49:23,080
Oh, there it is!

3665
01:49:23,140 --> 01:49:23,920
I see the bridge!

3666
01:49:23,920 --> 01:49:24,700
I see it!

3667
01:49:25,960 --> 01:49:26,340
Wait.

3668
01:49:30,680 --> 01:49:33,200
I don't know if anyone was in a hurry.

3669
01:49:33,200 --> 01:49:33,220
I don't know if anyone was in a hurry.

3670
01:49:33,740 --> 01:49:36,260
You look... you were like throwing yourself into a pit.

3671
01:49:37,240 --> 01:49:37,600
Me?

3672
01:49:38,280 --> 01:49:38,600
Yeah.

3673
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:40,060
Do we go yeah?

3674
01:49:43,080 --> 01:49:44,380
Can we climb up here?

3675
01:49:44,620 --> 01:49:45,600
Can we walk on this?

3676
01:49:45,600 --> 01:49:47,060
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

3677
01:49:47,220 --> 01:49:48,240
Just a little bit.

3678
01:49:48,540 --> 01:49:48,780
Yeah.

3679
01:49:48,780 --> 01:49:52,120
You can then go like here, and then here, and I'll... I'll catch you.

3680
01:49:52,380 --> 01:49:53,620
I'll like bring you up.

3681
01:49:53,980 --> 01:49:55,260
Okay, like walk up.

3682
01:49:55,460 --> 01:49:55,560
Yeah.

3683
01:49:56,760 --> 01:49:57,500
Wait, what is that?

3684
01:49:57,500 --> 01:49:58,640
You might be able to walk up that way.

3685
01:49:58,900 --> 01:49:59,140
Yeah?

3686
01:49:59,640 --> 01:50:01,800
I'm heading up.

3687
01:50:02,160 --> 01:50:04,180
Fire away, fire away.

3688
01:50:04,400 --> 01:50:07,260
I don't even know about my little pony version of that song.

3689
01:50:07,960 --> 01:50:09,740
What's the pony version of that song?

3690
01:50:09,960 --> 01:50:10,940
Yeah, what's the pony version of that song?

3691
01:50:10,940 --> 01:50:11,120
Yeah.

3692
01:50:11,560 --> 01:50:12,000
Octavia.

3693
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:12,100
Yeah.

3694
01:50:14,040 --> 01:50:14,840
What's the...

3695
01:50:16,460 --> 01:50:18,060
Oh, I know that song.

3696
01:50:18,260 --> 01:50:18,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3697
01:50:19,160 --> 01:50:19,760
I almost...

3698
01:50:19,760 --> 01:50:21,120
I almost gonna make it.

3699
01:50:23,400 --> 01:50:24,860
Imagine not making it.

3700
01:50:25,680 --> 01:50:26,840
Oh, I see the bridge.

3701
01:50:26,840 --> 01:50:27,720
I see the bridge.

3702
01:50:28,100 --> 01:50:29,100
I'm heading to the bridge.

3703
01:50:30,260 --> 01:50:33,840
Oh, we're already at the bridge.

3704
01:50:34,040 --> 01:50:34,340
Yeah.

3705
01:50:35,360 --> 01:50:36,520
How do we get to the...

3706
01:50:36,520 --> 01:50:37,440
Oh, we have to go down.

3707
01:50:40,080 --> 01:50:40,820
Look at us go.

3708
01:50:40,900 --> 01:50:41,640
We're speed running.

3709
01:50:42,880 --> 01:50:44,000
We're speed running.

3710
01:50:48,170 --> 01:50:49,530
Oh, I'm gonna speed run.

3711
01:50:50,050 --> 01:50:52,010
Guys, I might need a new monitor, guys.

3712
01:50:52,290 --> 01:50:53,710
This is not looking so good.

3713
01:50:54,870 --> 01:50:55,330
I...

3714
01:50:55,330 --> 01:51:00,070
If your whole computer turned off, I think it might be like your graphics card or driver.

3715
01:51:00,250 --> 01:51:01,010
Oh, not again.

3716
01:51:01,410 --> 01:51:02,250
Not again.

3717
01:51:02,810 --> 01:51:03,350
Not again.

3718
01:51:03,350 --> 01:51:03,750
Not again.

3719
01:51:03,890 --> 01:51:04,650
Why is it...

3720
01:51:04,650 --> 01:51:07,630
Why do I always get these PC problems?

3721
01:51:07,970 --> 01:51:08,690
Not again.

3722
01:51:11,250 --> 01:51:11,710
Cat.

3723
01:51:11,710 --> 01:51:12,790
What are you doing here?

3724
01:51:12,990 --> 01:51:13,830
I don't know.

3725
01:51:14,550 --> 01:51:15,570
I don't know.

3726
01:51:16,050 --> 01:51:17,550
I don't even know.

3727
01:51:17,990 --> 01:51:19,770
Wait, where do I go after this?

3728
01:51:21,410 --> 01:51:21,930
Up.

3729
01:51:22,290 --> 01:51:22,610
Go up.

3730
01:51:22,870 --> 01:51:23,290
Just keep going up.

3731
01:51:24,610 --> 01:51:24,770
Yeah.

3732
01:51:25,130 --> 01:51:25,950
Is it this way?

3733
01:51:27,110 --> 01:51:27,590
Yeah, yeah.

3734
01:51:29,700 --> 01:51:30,220
Okay.

3735
01:51:31,500 --> 01:51:34,560
You just said, yeah, because...

3736
01:51:34,560 --> 01:51:36,560
You say, yeah, because...

3737
01:51:36,560 --> 01:51:37,840
You're installing Marvel Rivals?

3738
01:51:38,060 --> 01:51:38,460
Yeah.

3739
01:51:38,700 --> 01:51:38,940
All right.

3740
01:51:39,040 --> 01:51:39,960
Where do I go, Lime?

3741
01:51:40,540 --> 01:51:41,280
Oh, you're not Lime.

3742
01:51:41,440 --> 01:51:42,340
Where do I go, Snuffy?

3743
01:51:42,620 --> 01:51:43,580
Yeah, it's mining crypto.

3744
01:51:43,800 --> 01:51:44,740
You just go up here.

3745
01:51:45,220 --> 01:51:45,480
What?

3746
01:51:45,780 --> 01:51:46,300
Oh, yeah.

3747
01:51:46,360 --> 01:51:50,980
I launched Marvel Rivals for like the first time since the tournament just to buy Loki in a swimsuit.

3748
01:51:50,980 --> 01:51:51,620
Oh, yeah, dude.

3749
01:51:51,840 --> 01:51:52,280
His like...

3750
01:51:52,280 --> 01:51:53,300
His like...

3751
01:51:53,300 --> 01:51:54,820
Has a bulge, too.

3752
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:55,640
Like, it's crazy.

3753
01:51:56,400 --> 01:51:56,780
His whole thing is amazing.

3754
01:51:56,780 --> 01:51:59,020
It's actually an actual bulge.

3755
01:51:59,700 --> 01:52:00,380
Wait, what?

3756
01:52:00,580 --> 01:52:03,000
Yeah, they're finally giving people what they want.

3757
01:52:04,060 --> 01:52:04,820
Yeah, yeah.

3758
01:52:04,900 --> 01:52:05,740
He has a bulge.

3759
01:52:06,060 --> 01:52:06,200
Yeah.

3760
01:52:07,200 --> 01:52:08,720
Look so far.

3761
01:52:09,500 --> 01:52:10,100
Thank you.

3762
01:52:10,720 --> 01:52:11,520
Where do we go after?

3763
01:52:11,660 --> 01:52:12,220
Left side?

3764
01:52:12,520 --> 01:52:13,040
Praying crunch.

3765
01:52:13,400 --> 01:52:13,540
Help me.

3766
01:52:13,720 --> 01:52:14,080
Thank you.

3767
01:52:14,820 --> 01:52:15,940
Is it left side?

3768
01:52:17,100 --> 01:52:18,120
I don't remember.

3769
01:52:18,360 --> 01:52:18,800
Uh...

3770
01:52:18,800 --> 01:52:20,140
I don't remember which way they went.

3771
01:52:20,340 --> 01:52:20,960
Me, too.

3772
01:52:21,880 --> 01:52:22,820
I'm gonna Google it.

3773
01:52:25,900 --> 01:52:26,780
If I...

3774
01:52:26,780 --> 01:52:28,620
Wait, are you Googling Loki's bulge?

3775
01:52:29,120 --> 01:52:29,400
Yeah.

3776
01:52:30,220 --> 01:52:34,400
Okay, maybe do Marvel Rivals Loki summer skin.

3777
01:52:37,100 --> 01:52:39,860
Yeah, I was gonna say, don't just Google Loki's bulge.

3778
01:52:39,980 --> 01:52:40,740
Don't just do that.

3779
01:52:40,900 --> 01:52:42,320
That might not be the best idea.

3780
01:52:42,320 --> 01:52:42,460
Tom Hiddleston.

3781
01:52:42,460 --> 01:52:43,740
Depending on what you wanted.

3782
01:52:44,140 --> 01:52:45,240
I have...

3783
01:52:45,240 --> 01:52:45,680
Oh my god.

3784
01:52:45,860 --> 01:52:46,940
Mr. Tom Hiddleston.

3785
01:52:47,840 --> 01:52:48,780
That's not fair.

3786
01:52:48,880 --> 01:52:50,420
He was naked, apparently, in the show.

3787
01:52:50,600 --> 01:52:51,420
So this was a setup.

3788
01:52:55,120 --> 01:52:57,320
Oh yeah, and then Luna's like...

3789
01:53:01,340 --> 01:53:01,740
Luna's...

3790
01:53:02,220 --> 01:53:03,180
Mint, are you okay?

3791
01:53:03,440 --> 01:53:05,980
Are you screaming because you're falling or screaming because you looked at the leaves?

3792
01:53:05,980 --> 01:53:07,840
I think she's screaming because she saw it.

3793
01:53:07,980 --> 01:53:08,920
She saw the skin.

3794
01:53:10,680 --> 01:53:11,080
What was that?

3795
01:53:11,080 --> 01:53:12,600
She saw it.

3796
01:53:15,700 --> 01:53:18,000
We just kept going up while you were Googling.

3797
01:53:19,640 --> 01:53:20,120
Okay.

3798
01:53:20,120 --> 01:53:21,020
While you're going to Google.

3799
01:53:21,400 --> 01:53:21,820
Thank you.

3800
01:53:22,040 --> 01:53:22,880
This one here.

3801
01:53:22,980 --> 01:53:23,660
This one here first.

3802
01:53:28,050 --> 01:53:29,630
Okay, Luna's ass though?

3803
01:53:29,810 --> 01:53:30,410
In the bikini?

3804
01:53:30,590 --> 01:53:31,550
That shit's crazy.

3805
01:53:37,350 --> 01:53:38,390
Wait, she sent...

3806
01:53:38,390 --> 01:53:40,290
Show her, like, Luna's ass too.

3807
01:53:47,610 --> 01:53:49,390
Oh, there's a suitcase over here.

3808
01:53:49,490 --> 01:53:50,570
We don't have to grab that suitcase.

3809
01:53:51,450 --> 01:53:53,090
Oh my god.

3810
01:53:53,670 --> 01:53:55,090
Is it real?

3811
01:53:55,290 --> 01:53:55,350
Real?

3812
01:53:55,770 --> 01:53:56,710
Yeah, it's real.

3813
01:53:58,890 --> 01:53:59,810
It's real.

3814
01:54:02,930 --> 01:54:03,910
Who's screaming?

3815
01:54:06,070 --> 01:54:06,670
She...

3816
01:54:06,670 --> 01:54:08,010
Mint, are you okay?

3817
01:54:08,350 --> 01:54:09,330
I was gonna say it.

3818
01:54:09,490 --> 01:54:11,710
I am not close enough to help anyone.

3819
01:54:17,110 --> 01:54:20,230
I was like, there is no way I can help anyone right now.

3820
01:54:20,270 --> 01:54:21,590
I'm so up ahead.

3821
01:54:25,980 --> 01:54:26,720
Oh, hey, nice.

3822
01:54:26,820 --> 01:54:27,300
I got a rope.

3823
01:54:28,860 --> 01:54:29,500
Rope time.

3824
01:54:30,060 --> 01:54:31,280
I don't know what to do with this rope.

3825
01:54:32,520 --> 01:54:33,440
I got a rope.

3826
01:54:34,760 --> 01:54:35,740
Okay, wait, guys.

3827
01:54:36,100 --> 01:54:37,200
Do I keep the rope?

3828
01:54:37,220 --> 01:54:38,500
Or do I not keep...

3829
01:54:38,500 --> 01:54:39,400
Oh, actually, I'm hungry.

3830
01:54:40,360 --> 01:54:41,160
I'm hungry.

3831
01:54:41,360 --> 01:54:42,840
I'm at chat right now.

3832
01:54:46,060 --> 01:54:47,940
I'm out here trying to win.

3833
01:54:50,920 --> 01:54:51,980
Alright, I'll climb.

3834
01:54:53,200 --> 01:54:53,760
Climb, climb.

3835
01:54:56,660 --> 01:54:57,900
Yeah, exactly.

3836
01:54:58,340 --> 01:54:58,720
That's right.

3837
01:55:00,040 --> 01:55:00,660
Look at me go.

3838
01:55:02,080 --> 01:55:02,780
That's right.

3839
01:55:03,140 --> 01:55:03,980
No time.

3840
01:55:04,800 --> 01:55:05,280
Okay.

3841
01:55:05,880 --> 01:55:08,300
Okay, don't climb this way because this was not the right way.

3842
01:55:08,580 --> 01:55:09,580
I got too confident.

3843
01:55:09,580 --> 01:55:10,920
It is this way.

3844
01:55:11,340 --> 01:55:12,320
I have your specialty.

3845
01:55:12,580 --> 01:55:13,200
No, it's not.

3846
01:55:18,620 --> 01:55:20,440
Wait, maybe it's like...

3847
01:55:23,890 --> 01:55:25,030
Wait, who said that?

3848
01:55:25,290 --> 01:55:25,570
Yeah, of course.

3849
01:55:25,750 --> 01:55:26,430
It's like mopping you.

3850
01:55:26,550 --> 01:55:27,010
You can have a...

3851
01:55:27,010 --> 01:55:27,530
Yeah, yeah.

3852
01:55:27,690 --> 01:55:28,290
This way, this way.

3853
01:55:28,770 --> 01:55:29,790
Wait, which way?

3854
01:55:30,830 --> 01:55:31,190
Of course.

3855
01:55:31,330 --> 01:55:32,370
This way, this way.

3856
01:55:33,090 --> 01:55:33,230
Eh?

3857
01:55:34,170 --> 01:55:34,430
Eh?

3858
01:55:34,670 --> 01:55:36,290
I've realized I have a granola bar too.

3859
01:55:36,670 --> 01:55:37,190
Oh, me too.

3860
01:55:37,490 --> 01:55:38,110
This way, okay.

3861
01:55:38,370 --> 01:55:38,670
Alright.

3862
01:55:39,150 --> 01:55:39,790
This way.

3863
01:55:40,410 --> 01:55:41,910
Follow the Scoutmaster.

3864
01:55:41,910 --> 01:55:42,050
There.

3865
01:55:50,490 --> 01:55:51,910
Scoutmaster knows da way.

3866
01:55:52,250 --> 01:55:53,030
She know da way.

3867
01:55:54,670 --> 01:55:56,250
She know da way.

3868
01:55:57,270 --> 01:55:58,790
Does she know da way?

3869
01:55:59,670 --> 01:56:00,890
Don't help Doki up.

3870
01:56:01,570 --> 01:56:02,750
That's fucked up.

3871
01:56:08,710 --> 01:56:09,190
Yeah.

3872
01:56:09,870 --> 01:56:10,350
Ideally.

3873
01:56:11,130 --> 01:56:11,610
Ideally.

3874
01:56:12,190 --> 01:56:12,250
Okay.

3875
01:56:13,090 --> 01:56:14,870
It's all that, you know, suggestions.

3876
01:56:15,310 --> 01:56:15,550
You know?

3877
01:56:20,190 --> 01:56:21,150
Oh no!

3878
01:56:21,710 --> 01:56:23,830
They climbed one mountain and it's all over.

3879
01:56:24,310 --> 01:56:25,130
Everybody's pretty cool.

3880
01:56:28,290 --> 01:56:28,770
Yeah.

3881
01:56:28,950 --> 01:56:31,170
I climbed one mountain and I know what I'm doing.

3882
01:56:31,170 --> 01:56:33,170
Like lost or something.

3883
01:56:33,630 --> 01:56:33,950
The show.

3884
01:56:34,130 --> 01:56:35,890
I know exactly what I'm doing.

3885
01:56:36,630 --> 01:56:41,110
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, don't get away from me.

3886
01:56:41,270 --> 01:56:42,250
Get away from me!

3887
01:56:42,970 --> 01:56:43,430
What?

3888
01:56:44,290 --> 01:56:45,150
Those are safe.

3889
01:56:45,290 --> 01:56:45,690
I ate them myself.

3890
01:56:45,710 --> 01:56:47,630
You wanted to force feed me.

3891
01:56:48,410 --> 01:56:49,490
No, those are safe.

3892
01:56:49,590 --> 01:56:50,130
Red is good.

3893
01:56:50,430 --> 01:56:50,630
Okay.

3894
01:56:50,830 --> 01:56:51,090
Green is bad.

3895
01:56:51,390 --> 01:56:52,070
Yellow is good.

3896
01:56:52,330 --> 01:56:52,970
Okay, that's good.

3897
01:56:53,870 --> 01:56:54,590
Wait, for what?

3898
01:56:54,910 --> 01:56:55,470
For eating.

3899
01:56:55,750 --> 01:56:56,550
The crisperies.

3900
01:56:56,790 --> 01:56:57,170
Yeah, yeah.

3901
01:56:57,170 --> 01:56:58,030
Blue banana.

3902
01:56:58,390 --> 01:57:01,190
I saw that I was trying to force feed me, so I got scared.

3903
01:57:01,290 --> 01:57:03,490
No, I was selfishly eating it myself.

3904
01:57:04,130 --> 01:57:04,750
Okay, that's good.

3905
01:57:04,950 --> 01:57:05,470
Come on, thank you.

3906
01:57:05,790 --> 01:57:06,410
Oh, thank you.

3907
01:57:06,550 --> 01:57:07,050
Oh, thank you.

3908
01:57:07,050 --> 01:57:07,070
Oh, hello.

3909
01:57:08,610 --> 01:57:10,270
I see the campfire!

3910
01:57:10,910 --> 01:57:11,830
Oh, I do too!

3911
01:57:12,510 --> 01:57:13,410
We're gonna get through this one fast.

3912
01:57:14,310 --> 01:57:15,150
Cause we're pros.

3913
01:57:15,910 --> 01:57:17,950
Oh my god, we're so good at this!

3914
01:57:20,970 --> 01:57:22,110
Look at us go!

3915
01:57:22,510 --> 01:57:24,730
You're just like bashing yourself on the rock like a ceiling.

3916
01:57:24,830 --> 01:57:26,050
You're freaking crazy.

3917
01:57:33,770 --> 01:57:34,170
Okay.

3918
01:57:34,550 --> 01:57:34,910
Yeah.

3919
01:57:35,170 --> 01:57:35,810
What do we get?

3920
01:57:36,070 --> 01:57:37,630
Oh, here's a chain launch here.

3921
01:57:37,870 --> 01:57:39,550
Min should take this antidote because she puts everything in her mouth.

3922
01:57:39,550 --> 01:57:41,410
Oh yeah, Min, you get the antidote.

3923
01:57:41,610 --> 01:57:42,550
Oh, I got the back.

3924
01:57:42,690 --> 01:57:44,250
Actually, yeah, I'll grab the backpack.

3925
01:57:45,130 --> 01:57:46,070
I want the fairy.

3926
01:57:47,770 --> 01:57:49,430
Oh, we have a morale boost.

3927
01:57:51,710 --> 01:57:52,490
What is this?

3928
01:57:54,830 --> 01:57:55,230
Oh?

3929
01:57:55,750 --> 01:57:55,850
Oh?

3930
01:57:56,050 --> 01:57:57,550
Why'd it get all scary all of a sudden?

3931
01:57:59,970 --> 01:58:02,290
I got the anti-rope spoon!

3932
01:58:02,730 --> 01:58:02,870
Yay!

3933
01:58:03,530 --> 01:58:04,770
Wait, I can pick some stuff up.

3934
01:58:08,700 --> 01:58:09,160
Oh.

3935
01:58:09,440 --> 01:58:09,860
Oh, yeah, wait.

3936
01:58:10,120 --> 01:58:13,420
How much stuff do we got in the, in the, in the, in the backpack?

3937
01:58:13,420 --> 01:58:15,440
My backpack's full now.

3938
01:58:16,520 --> 01:58:17,040
Oh.

3939
01:58:17,440 --> 01:58:18,500
Oh, wait, we get two now.

3940
01:58:18,700 --> 01:58:18,880
No stroke.

3941
01:58:19,480 --> 01:58:19,740
Yeah.

3942
01:58:20,880 --> 01:58:22,640
What does cooking it twice do?

3943
01:58:23,280 --> 01:58:23,540
Yeah.

3944
01:58:23,940 --> 01:58:24,980
It makes it well done.

3945
01:58:25,440 --> 01:58:26,340
Oh, what does it do?

3946
01:58:28,140 --> 01:58:28,660
Yeah,

3947
01:58:41,530 --> 01:58:42,310
it must be delicious.

3948
01:58:42,310 --> 01:58:44,250
Let's get to, let's get to the top, guys.

3949
01:58:44,390 --> 01:58:44,910
I believe.

3950
01:58:45,450 --> 01:58:45,830
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3951
01:58:45,830 --> 01:58:46,310
Guys, come on.

3952
01:58:46,390 --> 01:58:47,170
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3953
01:58:47,170 --> 01:58:48,570
With the power of friendship.

3954
01:58:49,150 --> 01:58:49,330
Yeah.

3955
01:58:50,110 --> 01:58:52,690
Isn't there a song from High School Musical, like...

3956
01:58:52,690 --> 01:58:54,310
Bop, bop, bop, to the top.

3957
01:58:54,530 --> 01:58:55,750
Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop.

3958
01:58:55,750 --> 01:58:56,150
Okay, that.

3959
01:58:56,650 --> 01:58:58,230
Na, na, na, na, yeah.

3960
01:58:58,610 --> 01:59:00,070
Bop, bop, bop, bop.

3961
01:59:00,070 --> 01:59:00,490
Bop, bop, bop.

3962
01:59:04,070 --> 01:59:08,190
I feel like I'm in, like, a car ride.

3963
01:59:09,750 --> 01:59:10,550
Carpool karaoke.

3964
01:59:10,550 --> 01:59:10,950
Are you okay?

3965
01:59:26,310 --> 01:59:27,330
Bop, bop, bop.

3966
01:59:28,110 --> 01:59:29,970
So, we need to... I'm sorry!

3967
01:59:31,950 --> 01:59:32,470
We're sliding!

3968
01:59:34,570 --> 01:59:35,270
I don't know.

3969
01:59:36,530 --> 01:59:39,770
Yeah, we ended up too far right, so we want to circle around to the left.

3970
01:59:40,350 --> 01:59:42,030
Oh, okay, I dropped down.

3971
01:59:42,370 --> 01:59:43,730
Oh, there's a suitcase!

3972
01:59:44,110 --> 01:59:44,810
Look, look, look!

3973
01:59:46,450 --> 01:59:48,010
Yeah, we saw that before.

3974
01:59:48,490 --> 01:59:49,770
I'm grabbing that suitcase.

3975
01:59:50,750 --> 01:59:51,950
I broke my leg.

3976
01:59:52,410 --> 01:59:55,710
Yeah, maybe we go more to the left since the right side was like suffering last year.

3977
01:59:55,710 --> 01:59:57,570
Yeah, that shit was hard.

3978
01:59:57,810 --> 01:59:58,310
What is this?

3979
01:59:58,830 --> 01:59:59,310
Nice!

3980
02:00:00,250 --> 02:00:02,990
I broke my leg and now I can use a med kit.

3981
02:00:04,490 --> 02:00:05,770
Use the energy drink.

3982
02:00:06,390 --> 02:00:06,730
Okay.

3983
02:00:07,590 --> 02:00:09,230
Yeah, use it.

3984
02:00:09,790 --> 02:00:13,630
I'm gonna eat my marshmallow first and then I'm gonna put it in here.

3985
02:00:14,370 --> 02:00:16,670
And then I'm gonna eat my energy... I did!

3986
02:00:17,890 --> 02:00:18,290
Oh.

3987
02:00:18,570 --> 02:00:18,910
Yeah.

3988
02:00:20,070 --> 02:00:21,190
And then we go up.

3989
02:00:22,150 --> 02:00:22,390
Yeah.

3990
02:00:22,390 --> 02:00:22,470
Yeah.

3991
02:00:24,530 --> 02:00:25,950
I'm gonna do the thing.

3992
02:00:26,190 --> 02:00:26,330
Wait.

3993
02:00:27,230 --> 02:00:28,330
Look at us go.

3994
02:00:30,550 --> 02:00:31,930
I'm gonna climb it.

3995
02:00:32,290 --> 02:00:32,870
Snuffy's...

3996
02:00:32,870 --> 02:00:33,250
Snuffy!

3997
02:00:33,790 --> 02:00:37,390
Lima said we shouldn't climb when it's raining, but clearly she's a liar.

3998
02:00:37,390 --> 02:00:37,410
Okay.

3999
02:00:45,230 --> 02:00:47,150
Ice Scoutmaster didn't know what's up!

4000
02:00:53,750 --> 02:00:56,290
Guys, I think I fucked up my PC again.

4001
02:00:57,550 --> 02:00:57,970
Guys.

4002
02:01:02,070 --> 02:01:03,170
Oh my god, I'm okay.

4003
02:01:03,590 --> 02:01:03,990
I...

4004
02:01:03,990 --> 02:01:04,450
Oh my...

4005
02:01:04,450 --> 02:01:05,690
Oh my god, I'm okay.

4006
02:01:05,690 --> 02:01:06,030
Okay.

4007
02:01:07,350 --> 02:01:07,770
Oh...

4008
02:01:07,770 --> 02:01:09,770
My god, that was scary.

4009
02:01:10,210 --> 02:01:11,710
I didn't need to call you a bitch then.

4010
02:01:11,730 --> 02:01:13,330
I thought you were just refusing to help me up.

4011
02:01:13,410 --> 02:01:13,830
Are you good?

4012
02:01:13,830 --> 02:01:14,750
No, okay.

4013
02:01:15,130 --> 02:01:15,870
I'm okay.

4014
02:01:16,150 --> 02:01:16,930
I'm okay.

4015
02:01:18,050 --> 02:01:19,010
I'm okay.

4016
02:01:19,730 --> 02:01:21,110
Guys, my PC...

4017
02:01:21,110 --> 02:01:23,190
The Grunkle curse is going strong.

4018
02:01:24,670 --> 02:01:25,450
I think...

4019
02:01:25,450 --> 02:01:28,130
Honestly, I think your computer might be on the way out.

4020
02:01:28,330 --> 02:01:29,050
There's something along.

4021
02:01:29,270 --> 02:01:30,310
Oh my god.

4022
02:01:30,630 --> 02:01:30,690
What?

4023
02:01:31,530 --> 02:01:32,990
Do you have like an Intel CPU?

4024
02:01:33,170 --> 02:01:34,070
Are you melting away?

4025
02:01:34,110 --> 02:01:34,550
No, AMD.

4026
02:01:34,790 --> 02:01:35,350
It's AMD.

4027
02:01:35,710 --> 02:01:36,370
Oh my...

4028
02:01:36,370 --> 02:01:37,430
Guys, I think...

4029
02:01:37,430 --> 02:01:40,330
I think I might have to take it to the doctors later.

4030
02:01:42,050 --> 02:01:43,410
Yeah, maybe a little bit.

4031
02:01:44,630 --> 02:01:46,930
I don't know, I don't know what's going on.

4032
02:01:47,130 --> 02:01:47,870
Okay, I have the...

4033
02:01:47,870 --> 02:01:48,910
I swear I have a curse.

4034
02:01:49,350 --> 02:01:50,650
When it comes to PC.

4035
02:01:51,030 --> 02:01:51,610
I think so too.

4036
02:01:51,930 --> 02:01:52,030
Yeah.

4037
02:01:52,310 --> 02:01:53,610
I think we're too far right again.

4038
02:01:53,870 --> 02:01:54,050
Hold on.

4039
02:01:54,250 --> 02:01:54,850
I think so.

4040
02:01:57,490 --> 02:01:58,790
I don't know where we'd go.

4041
02:02:11,550 --> 02:02:13,350
Oh, it's the magic bean.

4042
02:02:14,010 --> 02:02:15,430
It's the magic bean.

4043
02:02:16,530 --> 02:02:17,890
Yeah, the magic bean.

4044
02:02:18,890 --> 02:02:20,170
Yeah, watch this.

4045
02:02:24,070 --> 02:02:25,590
Wait, it didn't grow.

4046
02:02:26,470 --> 02:02:27,530
Oh, there it is.

4047
02:02:28,990 --> 02:02:29,950
It's a grower.

4048
02:02:30,130 --> 02:02:31,230
Dude, it's so big.

4049
02:02:31,530 --> 02:02:31,930
Holy shit.

4050
02:02:32,110 --> 02:02:33,650
It's just getting bigger and bigger.

4051
02:02:33,750 --> 02:02:35,190
It just gets bigger and bigger.

4052
02:02:35,370 --> 02:02:37,230
I think this might have been a slight waste of it.

4053
02:02:37,610 --> 02:02:38,210
Yeah, Snuffy.

4054
02:02:38,210 --> 02:02:41,230
Why did you waste it, Snuffy?

4055
02:02:42,150 --> 02:02:44,770
I should have been more thoughtful about my uses.

4056
02:02:45,050 --> 02:02:45,450
I know.

4057
02:02:45,590 --> 02:02:46,930
I hope you learned your lesson.

4058
02:02:56,710 --> 02:03:00,130
Oh, there's apples.

4059
02:03:00,270 --> 02:03:00,870
Is anybody hungry?

4060
02:03:01,550 --> 02:03:02,410
No, we're fucked.

4061
02:03:02,510 --> 02:03:02,930
A little bit.

4062
02:03:03,450 --> 02:03:04,390
But I have trail mix.

4063
02:03:05,370 --> 02:03:06,010
I'm okay.

4064
02:03:06,510 --> 02:03:07,430
I got none of us.

4065
02:03:07,830 --> 02:03:08,970
We need to hang left.

4066
02:03:09,170 --> 02:03:09,930
We're on the edge of the map.

4067
02:03:10,090 --> 02:03:10,550
We can somehow.

4068
02:03:11,070 --> 02:03:11,250
Yeah!

4069
02:03:12,190 --> 02:03:13,170
We just like the edge.

4070
02:03:13,350 --> 02:03:14,450
Oh, there's a little...

4071
02:03:14,450 --> 02:03:15,130
Apparently.

4072
02:03:15,990 --> 02:03:17,610
Wait, there's a little shelf thing.

4073
02:03:17,790 --> 02:03:18,610
You get your shelf, Shroom.

4074
02:03:18,950 --> 02:03:19,130
Yeah.

4075
02:03:23,330 --> 02:03:24,910
Alright, where do I use this?

4076
02:03:25,330 --> 02:03:26,370
Oh, I remember this!

4077
02:03:27,290 --> 02:03:28,990
We went right after that, remember?

4078
02:03:29,870 --> 02:03:31,390
We saw this and we went right.

4079
02:03:31,490 --> 02:03:31,710
Yeah, I don't think we should.

4080
02:03:32,390 --> 02:03:34,730
No, but... We shouldn't, because that's the edge of the map.

4081
02:03:35,010 --> 02:03:35,010
Really?

4082
02:03:35,130 --> 02:03:36,630
Oh, we lived on the edge of the map.

4083
02:03:37,690 --> 02:03:39,170
Well, it was kind of sketchy, though.

4084
02:03:39,330 --> 02:03:40,350
Everyone but me died.

4085
02:03:41,190 --> 02:03:43,830
Yeah, but like... That was... No, I didn't die.

4086
02:03:43,870 --> 02:03:44,490
I lived.

4087
02:03:44,690 --> 02:03:46,210
We died in the ice area, remember?

4088
02:03:46,550 --> 02:03:46,830
Oh, wait.

4089
02:03:46,870 --> 02:03:48,290
No, we didn't die in the ice area.

4090
02:03:48,350 --> 02:03:48,830
No, you did.

4091
02:03:48,850 --> 02:03:49,650
You did die here.

4092
02:03:51,790 --> 02:03:53,090
How did I do hear that?

4093
02:03:54,430 --> 02:03:55,090
I don't know.

4094
02:03:55,790 --> 02:03:56,850
Wait, you said go left.

4095
02:03:57,890 --> 02:03:58,250
Yeah.

4096
02:03:58,710 --> 02:03:59,530
I can't see.

4097
02:04:01,150 --> 02:04:02,490
Well, let me nudge you out the way, then.

4098
02:04:04,410 --> 02:04:04,770
Alright.

4099
02:04:04,770 --> 02:04:06,450
Hmm.

4100
02:04:06,770 --> 02:04:07,510
Let's see.

4101
02:04:10,900 --> 02:04:13,640
Is that the right way, Scoutmaster?

4102
02:04:15,300 --> 02:04:16,500
Scoutmaster!

4103
02:04:17,180 --> 02:04:18,380
Scoutmaster!

4104
02:04:18,480 --> 02:04:19,360
Scoutmaster!

4105
02:04:21,180 --> 02:04:22,960
I gave you a platform.

4106
02:04:26,820 --> 02:04:29,000
You're welcome, Scoutmaster.

4107
02:04:34,720 --> 02:04:35,840
You're welcome.

4108
02:04:39,340 --> 02:04:40,520
Does this ever disappear?

4109
02:04:41,460 --> 02:04:41,740
No.

4110
02:04:43,260 --> 02:04:43,660
Oh, no.

4111
02:04:43,860 --> 02:04:44,700
We're not going this way?

4112
02:04:44,900 --> 02:04:45,700
We go this way?

4113
02:04:45,800 --> 02:04:46,300
I don't know.

4114
02:04:46,460 --> 02:04:47,080
We're over here.

4115
02:04:47,860 --> 02:04:48,400
We have...

4116
02:04:48,400 --> 02:04:48,540
We have several...

4117
02:04:48,540 --> 02:04:49,740
Doki has several ropes.

4118
02:04:49,880 --> 02:04:51,180
I'm just gonna say that out loud.

4119
02:04:51,520 --> 02:04:51,920
Um...

4120
02:04:51,920 --> 02:04:52,760
Yeah, I do.

4121
02:04:53,320 --> 02:04:53,640
Don't shame her.

4122
02:04:54,140 --> 02:04:54,940
Don't shame her.

4123
02:04:55,360 --> 02:04:55,760
Um...

4124
02:04:55,760 --> 02:04:56,500
I'm not shaming.

4125
02:04:56,740 --> 02:04:57,220
I'm just saying that.

4126
02:04:57,220 --> 02:04:57,400
And...

4127
02:04:57,400 --> 02:04:58,860
Yeah, you tattle tell her.

4128
02:04:59,060 --> 02:05:00,320
I'm just saying that...

4129
02:05:00,320 --> 02:05:01,900
You're such a tattle teller.

4130
02:05:01,900 --> 02:05:07,300
We have to get further that someone is hoarding the supplies.

4131
02:05:07,320 --> 02:05:08,280
I am not hoarding.

4132
02:05:08,420 --> 02:05:10,660
Anyone else can open my backpack.

4133
02:05:11,080 --> 02:05:12,700
It's not just a me thing.

4134
02:05:13,800 --> 02:05:14,520
Anyone...

4135
02:05:15,200 --> 02:05:16,520
Put you off.

4136
02:05:18,840 --> 02:05:19,880
Do it.

4137
02:05:19,880 --> 02:05:20,440
Do it.

4138
02:05:20,440 --> 02:05:20,640
Do it.

4139
02:05:20,640 --> 02:05:20,880
Do it.

4140
02:05:20,980 --> 02:05:21,240
Live.

4141
02:05:21,860 --> 02:05:23,520
Live with the crimes.

4142
02:05:24,080 --> 02:05:25,680
Live with the crimes.

4143
02:05:27,120 --> 02:05:28,880
I don't know what we can do anymore.

4144
02:05:28,880 --> 02:05:30,280
Let's just go to the left side.

4145
02:05:30,460 --> 02:05:30,960
Right side.

4146
02:05:32,240 --> 02:05:33,200
Left side.

4147
02:05:33,360 --> 02:05:33,940
Right side.

4148
02:05:36,720 --> 02:05:39,520
We kind of stranded ourselves by going down.

4149
02:05:39,540 --> 02:05:41,360
Why are you looking at me like that?

4150
02:05:41,660 --> 02:05:42,400
What the hell?

4151
02:05:42,400 --> 02:05:45,120
I mean, if we can get over here, that is such an easy way up.

4152
02:05:49,860 --> 02:05:51,120
I think she's dead.

4153
02:05:52,640 --> 02:05:53,600
What happened?

4154
02:05:53,940 --> 02:05:55,160
I think she died.

4155
02:05:56,280 --> 02:05:58,040
Did you see what happened?

4156
02:05:58,400 --> 02:05:59,380
She like ricocheted.

4157
02:05:59,740 --> 02:06:00,580
She just jumped.

4158
02:06:01,280 --> 02:06:02,080
She did a flip.

4159
02:06:03,020 --> 02:06:04,400
What did I do?

4160
02:06:05,360 --> 02:06:06,300
Wait, she's alive?

4161
02:06:06,760 --> 02:06:07,760
She's alive, she's alive, she's alive.

4162
02:06:10,630 --> 02:06:12,490
Oh my god, how does she live?

4163
02:06:13,870 --> 02:06:16,550
Yeah, that's why something a killer would ask.

4164
02:06:17,110 --> 02:06:18,210
How did she live?

4165
02:06:20,630 --> 02:06:24,570
How did she have no stamina for that?

4166
02:06:27,430 --> 02:06:28,270
Send the rope.

4167
02:06:31,270 --> 02:06:34,570
Wait, we can use the rope down here and then go to where the ammo is.

4168
02:06:35,710 --> 02:06:38,510
Or you could be gamers and catch the vine.

4169
02:06:38,790 --> 02:06:39,910
What could possibly go wrong?

4170
02:06:40,570 --> 02:06:41,150
Oh, okay.

4171
02:06:41,270 --> 02:06:42,030
Okay, let's do it.

4172
02:06:42,470 --> 02:06:44,370
No, use the rope if you're scared.

4173
02:06:44,450 --> 02:06:45,330
Use the rope if you're scared.

4174
02:06:45,330 --> 02:06:49,470
Oh my god.

4175
02:06:49,470 --> 02:06:50,210
Did she catch it?

4176
02:06:50,710 --> 02:06:51,370
Uh...

4177
02:06:51,370 --> 02:06:52,490
Did she catch it?

4178
02:06:53,610 --> 02:06:54,270
Um...

4179
02:06:54,270 --> 02:06:56,030
Did she... did she catch it?

4180
02:06:56,390 --> 02:06:57,710
Did she...

4181
02:06:57,710 --> 02:06:58,010
Mint?

4182
02:06:59,570 --> 02:07:00,230
Mint?

4183
02:07:00,590 --> 02:07:01,250
Um...

4184
02:07:01,250 --> 02:07:02,270
It did start raining.

4185
02:07:02,430 --> 02:07:03,830
Did she just like slip and die?

4186
02:07:05,130 --> 02:07:05,650
Okay, go, go.

4187
02:07:06,950 --> 02:07:08,950
Is... can we... can we check on her?

4188
02:07:08,950 --> 02:07:09,610
Is this enough?

4189
02:07:09,710 --> 02:07:09,990
Can we check on her?

4190
02:07:10,170 --> 02:07:11,230
Let me know if it's enough.

4191
02:07:15,010 --> 02:07:16,050
Is this enough?

4192
02:07:27,970 --> 02:07:28,450
What?

4193
02:07:34,680 --> 02:07:36,840
Wait, I don't think this is gonna work.

4194
02:07:43,960 --> 02:07:45,200
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

4195
02:07:45,360 --> 02:07:46,880
Before I do this, Snuffy, go back up.

4196
02:07:46,980 --> 02:07:53,060
Snuffy, before we do this, I'm gonna put the backpack down and if anything happens to me...

4197
02:07:53,060 --> 02:07:53,420
No!

4198
02:07:53,840 --> 02:07:56,820
If anything happens to me...

4199
02:07:56,820 --> 02:08:02,000
You still have the backpack if anything happens to me.

4200
02:08:02,260 --> 02:08:03,440
Oh my god.

4201
02:08:06,020 --> 02:08:06,480
Okay.

4202
02:08:07,020 --> 02:08:08,420
Just in case.

4203
02:08:09,620 --> 02:08:10,400
Just...

4204
02:08:10,680 --> 02:08:11,820
Just in case.

4205
02:08:12,460 --> 02:08:13,020
Okay.

4206
02:08:13,180 --> 02:08:13,960
Do a prayer.

4207
02:08:14,240 --> 02:08:15,440
Remember your form.

4208
02:08:15,860 --> 02:08:17,000
Don't forget to press me.

4209
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:20,360
Wait, what happened to me?

4210
02:08:20,580 --> 02:08:20,920
What?

4211
02:08:22,060 --> 02:08:23,180
You're like...

4212
02:08:23,180 --> 02:08:24,960
You look like you fell on the floor.

4213
02:08:25,620 --> 02:08:27,300
Wait, why can't I go down?

4214
02:08:27,800 --> 02:08:29,560
Oh no, I'm sleepy now.

4215
02:08:29,760 --> 02:08:30,120
I'm...

4216
02:08:31,100 --> 02:08:32,060
You're sleepy?

4217
02:08:32,200 --> 02:08:32,900
Do something!

4218
02:08:33,280 --> 02:08:33,940
Do something!

4219
02:08:34,600 --> 02:08:35,720
Oh my god, now I can.

4220
02:08:35,880 --> 02:08:36,020
Okay.

4221
02:08:38,360 --> 02:08:38,680
Okay.

4222
02:08:39,760 --> 02:08:40,320
Okay.

4223
02:08:40,320 --> 02:08:41,680
Okay, I'm gonna jump down.

4224
02:08:41,860 --> 02:08:42,780
It's left click.

4225
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:43,580
It's left click.

4226
02:08:43,740 --> 02:08:43,860
It's left click to...

4227
02:08:43,860 --> 02:08:45,880
I know it's him, fucker.

4228
02:08:52,520 --> 02:08:53,080
I'm...

4229
02:08:53,080 --> 02:08:53,280
I'm...

4230
02:08:53,280 --> 02:08:53,420
I'm...

4231
02:08:57,960 --> 02:08:58,520
I'm okay.

4232
02:08:58,740 --> 02:08:59,640
I'm okay.

4233
02:08:59,960 --> 02:09:00,780
I'm okay.

4234
02:09:01,260 --> 02:09:01,820
I'm okay.

4235
02:09:01,900 --> 02:09:02,380
I grabbed the dog.

4236
02:09:02,720 --> 02:09:03,540
I'm okay.

4237
02:09:03,760 --> 02:09:04,080
I'm okay.

4238
02:09:04,280 --> 02:09:05,040
I'm okay.

4239
02:09:05,220 --> 02:09:05,780
I'm okay.

4240
02:09:05,880 --> 02:09:05,980
I lived.

4241
02:09:06,760 --> 02:09:07,620
I lived.

4242
02:09:07,800 --> 02:09:08,440
I lived.

4243
02:09:08,580 --> 02:09:08,700
I lived.

4244
02:09:08,880 --> 02:09:09,740
I'm okay.

4245
02:09:10,920 --> 02:09:13,060
Grab the bugle, grab me from my garage.

4246
02:09:13,140 --> 02:09:16,180
I'm not gonna grab a stupid bugle.

4247
02:09:16,380 --> 02:09:17,120
I'm alive.

4248
02:09:17,440 --> 02:09:18,440
I'm alive.

4249
02:09:19,940 --> 02:09:22,000
Everyone get back up.

4250
02:09:22,720 --> 02:09:24,600
Everybody... Where am I?

4251
02:09:25,080 --> 02:09:25,240
Where am I?

4252
02:09:25,240 --> 02:09:25,720
Where am I?

4253
02:09:26,820 --> 02:09:28,400
Don't say that.

4254
02:09:29,220 --> 02:09:29,520
No!

4255
02:09:31,280 --> 02:09:33,000
Get stick bugged.

4256
02:09:34,340 --> 02:09:37,160
Get stick bugged.

4257
02:09:42,260 --> 02:09:43,220
I'm okay.

4258
02:09:43,440 --> 02:09:44,120
I'm okay.

4259
02:09:53,880 --> 02:09:57,120
This is all men's fault.

4260
02:09:57,280 --> 02:09:59,100
This is all your fault.

4261
02:09:59,280 --> 02:10:01,040
This is your fault, men.

4262
02:10:01,460 --> 02:10:02,400
I told you were alive.

4263
02:10:02,880 --> 02:10:04,640
This is your... Okay.

4264
02:10:05,060 --> 02:10:06,160
Are you okay up there?

4265
02:10:06,160 --> 02:10:06,840
Yeah, yeah.

4266
02:10:07,480 --> 02:10:08,420
I'm good.

4267
02:10:08,800 --> 02:10:09,320
I'm good.

4268
02:10:10,360 --> 02:10:13,250
I'm on her own.

4269
02:10:13,710 --> 02:10:17,190
This is all... This is all your fault, men.

4270
02:10:18,750 --> 02:10:20,610
You mess with my groove.

4271
02:10:20,910 --> 02:10:22,590
You mess with my groove.

4272
02:10:23,850 --> 02:10:24,770
Excuse me, men.

4273
02:10:24,850 --> 02:10:26,270
You've thrown off Doki by the groove.

4274
02:10:26,270 --> 02:10:27,790
Oh, I'm not.

4275
02:10:27,990 --> 02:10:28,610
Sorry.

4276
02:10:34,530 --> 02:10:35,650
I'm crying.

4277
02:10:36,550 --> 02:10:37,250
Okay.

4278
02:10:39,290 --> 02:10:42,670
My POV was so... You did this.

4279
02:10:42,890 --> 02:10:43,790
You did this.

4280
02:10:43,790 --> 02:10:45,770
For mine, I just saw Doki fucking bounce.

4281
02:10:45,770 --> 02:10:46,970
It was so good.

4282
02:10:47,210 --> 02:10:48,250
You cursed me.

4283
02:10:48,470 --> 02:10:49,950
You cursed me.

4284
02:10:51,870 --> 02:10:52,730
It's okay.

4285
02:10:52,950 --> 02:10:53,550
It's okay.

4286
02:10:53,850 --> 02:10:55,650
Snuffy has the rest of the backpack.

4287
02:10:56,810 --> 02:10:58,590
Is Snuffy alive?

4288
02:10:58,970 --> 02:10:59,070
Is Snuffy alive?

4289
02:10:59,070 --> 02:10:59,410
She is.

4290
02:10:59,650 --> 02:11:00,030
She is.

4291
02:11:00,890 --> 02:11:01,450
Hi, Snuffy.

4292
02:11:02,030 --> 02:11:02,390
Hi.

4293
02:11:02,390 --> 02:11:05,270
I was like, I don't know where everybody went.

4294
02:11:05,530 --> 02:11:06,250
I don't know where everybody went.

4295
02:11:06,710 --> 02:11:07,330
I don't know how she...

4296
02:11:07,330 --> 02:11:08,590
I don't even know how she...

4297
02:11:08,590 --> 02:11:09,850
But you died.

4298
02:11:10,050 --> 02:11:10,910
Did you live?

4299
02:11:11,110 --> 02:11:11,710
How did you die?

4300
02:11:13,290 --> 02:11:17,310
Someone... someone cursed me to all eternity.

4301
02:11:18,710 --> 02:11:21,310
Someone cursed me to all eternity.

4302
02:11:25,030 --> 02:11:26,510
That's kind of nice, though.

4303
02:11:26,670 --> 02:11:27,590
That's so romantic.

4304
02:11:29,110 --> 02:11:30,010
I'm dead!

4305
02:11:30,770 --> 02:11:31,750
What do you mean?

4306
02:11:32,010 --> 02:11:32,790
I'm dead!

4307
02:11:35,470 --> 02:11:40,330
To be fair, as soon as I saw you hit the ground, I kind of marked you as deceased.

4308
02:11:41,550 --> 02:11:47,150
It was, like, a pretty bad... It was a pretty bad... Yeah, it was pretty bad.

4309
02:11:47,430 --> 02:11:50,950
I had, like, adrenaline shock from the hit.

4310
02:11:50,950 --> 02:11:52,790
So, like, I didn't die right away.

4311
02:11:53,010 --> 02:11:55,710
Like, Dresden was taking me over to the edge.

4312
02:11:56,470 --> 02:11:57,630
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

4313
02:11:57,670 --> 02:11:58,390
I'll be right back.

4314
02:11:58,590 --> 02:11:59,710
Alright, I'm gonna check on that.

4315
02:12:00,470 --> 02:12:01,950
Are you close to the... I'm waiting.

4316
02:12:02,350 --> 02:12:03,650
You should just get to the tap.

4317
02:12:05,010 --> 02:12:05,290
No, no.

4318
02:12:05,390 --> 02:12:08,310
If you go too far, the Scoutmaster spawns and knocks you off the mountain.

4319
02:12:08,650 --> 02:12:09,710
Because teamwork is important.

4320
02:12:09,890 --> 02:12:10,670
Wait, really?

4321
02:12:11,670 --> 02:12:12,070
Yeah.

4322
02:12:12,510 --> 02:12:14,910
He fucking spawns and kicks you?

4323
02:12:16,890 --> 02:12:17,370
That's fucking hardcore.

4324
02:12:17,370 --> 02:12:19,530
Yeah, he chases you down and, like, takes you off the mountain.

4325
02:12:19,530 --> 02:12:21,690
He's like, wow, you're not working as a team?

4326
02:12:21,850 --> 02:12:22,430
Go fuck yourself.

4327
02:12:22,630 --> 02:12:22,850
Wow.

4328
02:12:23,030 --> 02:12:25,110
Okay, so all we need is Snuffy to die, then.

4329
02:12:26,490 --> 02:12:27,850
Or, you know, get to me.

4330
02:12:27,930 --> 02:12:28,530
One or the other.

4331
02:12:29,490 --> 02:12:30,890
I used your Snuffy ghost.

4332
02:12:31,330 --> 02:12:32,130
Did you hear that?

4333
02:12:32,330 --> 02:12:33,290
Snuffy was like, what?

4334
02:12:41,470 --> 02:12:42,190
Hi, Snuffy.

4335
02:12:43,310 --> 02:12:43,930
It's okay.

4336
02:12:44,190 --> 02:12:44,590
It's okay.

4337
02:12:44,710 --> 02:12:45,210
You'll be fine.

4338
02:12:45,530 --> 02:12:46,230
Did you hear something?

4339
02:12:46,390 --> 02:12:47,610
Somebody just said something to me.

4340
02:12:47,830 --> 02:12:47,950
No.

4341
02:12:48,150 --> 02:12:49,050
Who said what?

4342
02:12:49,570 --> 02:12:50,590
Who said what?

4343
02:12:50,890 --> 02:12:50,950
Mint?

4344
02:12:51,310 --> 02:12:52,350
Oh, it must have been Mint.

4345
02:12:53,070 --> 02:12:54,170
I can't believe... What did she say?

4346
02:12:54,750 --> 02:12:56,590
Are you able to get off Snuffy?

4347
02:12:58,250 --> 02:12:59,790
Um... She doesn't know what to do.

4348
02:13:00,970 --> 02:13:02,610
I can, like... Can you get to here?

4349
02:13:02,810 --> 02:13:03,450
Oh, wait, sure.

4350
02:13:03,590 --> 02:13:05,370
You're literally right there next to her.

4351
02:13:07,350 --> 02:13:08,730
Oh, I got you.

4352
02:13:08,890 --> 02:13:08,970
I got you.

4353
02:13:08,990 --> 02:13:09,990
Yeah, you guys got each other.

4354
02:13:10,290 --> 02:13:10,290
This way.

4355
02:13:10,290 --> 02:13:10,590
This way.

4356
02:13:10,970 --> 02:13:10,970
This way.

4357
02:13:10,970 --> 02:13:11,710
I'm... Okay.

4358
02:13:13,090 --> 02:13:13,870
Just tumbling.

4359
02:13:14,250 --> 02:13:14,710
Hey, girl.

4360
02:13:15,470 --> 02:13:15,870
What's up?

4361
02:13:17,350 --> 02:13:18,610
Hey, what is this, like, wind?

4362
02:13:18,790 --> 02:13:19,810
Do you see, like, wind or something?

4363
02:13:19,810 --> 02:13:20,190
Yes, yeah.

4364
02:13:20,410 --> 02:13:21,190
I don't know what that's about.

4365
02:13:21,350 --> 02:13:22,530
I think it's a broken waterfall.

4366
02:13:22,870 --> 02:13:23,010
Yeah.

4367
02:13:23,670 --> 02:13:25,170
At least just no clipping.

4368
02:13:26,770 --> 02:13:26,810
Yeah.

4369
02:13:27,830 --> 02:13:30,070
This, honestly, this map generation seems kind of funky.

4370
02:13:30,210 --> 02:13:30,790
Oh, yeah, here it is.

4371
02:13:31,370 --> 02:13:31,890
What the fuck?

4372
02:13:33,030 --> 02:13:38,210
I do think getting robbed out of our, like, big luggage at the top is kind of cruel for the RNG.

4373
02:13:38,210 --> 02:13:42,750
I can't believe Peak is the game that's fucking destroying my PC right now.

4374
02:13:42,950 --> 02:13:42,970
So, do we wanna go around this way?

4375
02:13:42,970 --> 02:13:42,970
Or around this way?

4376
02:13:42,970 --> 02:13:42,970
Or around this way?

4377
02:13:42,970 --> 02:13:43,450
Because it's kinda clean and nice.

4378
02:13:44,130 --> 02:13:44,150
Yeah.

4379
02:13:45,690 --> 02:13:45,690
Yeah.

4380
02:13:45,690 --> 02:13:49,990
Because my main monitor keeps flickering from black screen to the main... Oh.

4381
02:13:49,990 --> 02:13:49,990
Oh.

4382
02:13:49,990 --> 02:13:50,990
That's not good, right?

4383
02:13:51,450 --> 02:13:53,670
That's... No, that's usually...

4384
02:13:53,670 --> 02:13:54,990
Uh, it's evolving.

4385
02:13:55,470 --> 02:13:57,110
Can you guys relate to this picture card?

4386
02:13:57,370 --> 02:13:57,990
It's trying to talk to you.

4387
02:13:58,010 --> 02:13:58,870
I don't think that's it.

4388
02:13:59,110 --> 02:14:00,010
I don't think that's it.

4389
02:14:00,210 --> 02:14:02,290
Hold on, let me... Let's check this way around.

4390
02:14:02,950 --> 02:14:03,230
This will...

4391
02:14:03,230 --> 02:14:06,110
Guys, I might need to take my PC to the doctor's tomorrow.

4392
02:14:10,010 --> 02:14:13,990
I haven't installed my new CPU yet, because I didn't have time to go to the...

4393
02:14:13,990 --> 02:14:14,790
The...

4394
02:14:14,790 --> 02:14:16,070
The PC people.

4395
02:14:21,390 --> 02:14:22,990
She went to the other side.

4396
02:14:23,150 --> 02:14:24,170
You should go back down.

4397
02:14:25,790 --> 02:14:26,530
Going down?

4398
02:14:26,890 --> 02:14:28,630
Yeah, she went... No, left side.

4399
02:14:28,690 --> 02:14:29,530
Where you came from?

4400
02:14:29,610 --> 02:14:30,390
She went the other way.

4401
02:14:32,010 --> 02:14:33,230
I'm coming, I'm coming.

4402
02:14:34,750 --> 02:14:35,350
Oh, whoa.

4403
02:14:35,450 --> 02:14:36,150
You're on the vine.

4404
02:14:38,830 --> 02:14:40,010
How did we...

4405
02:14:40,890 --> 02:14:42,330
How did we get up top?

4406
02:14:43,850 --> 02:14:45,630
I don't remember how we get up top.

4407
02:14:46,610 --> 02:14:48,310
I don't remember the way either now.

4408
02:14:49,430 --> 02:14:51,270
There's a good mushroom over here, but...

4409
02:14:51,270 --> 02:14:51,950
Maybe this way?

4410
02:14:52,070 --> 02:14:53,650
Wait, we could climb from there, right?

4411
02:14:56,950 --> 02:14:57,990
Well, that works.

4412
02:14:57,990 --> 02:14:58,050
Yes.

4413
02:14:59,510 --> 02:15:00,710
I'm back, sorry.

4414
02:15:01,090 --> 02:15:02,470
I was getting more tea, too.

4415
02:15:03,330 --> 02:15:03,550
Oh, god.

4416
02:15:03,550 --> 02:15:03,710
Are you good?

4417
02:15:06,030 --> 02:15:06,430
Yeah.

4418
02:15:06,430 --> 02:15:07,570
What kind of tea did you get?

4419
02:15:07,610 --> 02:15:08,410
Yeah, what kind of tea?

4420
02:15:08,670 --> 02:15:09,790
Zephi, could you give me a hand up?

4421
02:15:10,030 --> 02:15:11,110
Nice again, my job.

4422
02:15:11,270 --> 02:15:11,570
Yes, yes.

4423
02:15:13,350 --> 02:15:14,150
Thank you.

4424
02:15:15,890 --> 02:15:17,150
Look at you guys.

4425
02:15:17,610 --> 02:15:18,390
You're almost there.

4426
02:15:18,390 --> 02:15:18,730
Whoa!

4427
02:15:19,130 --> 02:15:19,290
Are you?

4428
02:15:19,550 --> 02:15:19,830
Maybe?

4429
02:15:19,950 --> 02:15:20,830
I think so.

4430
02:15:21,090 --> 02:15:22,010
We're making progress.

4431
02:15:23,710 --> 02:15:24,510
I believe.

4432
02:15:24,510 --> 02:15:25,250
Go to the water.

4433
02:15:26,370 --> 02:15:26,890
He he he.

4434
02:15:26,930 --> 02:15:28,470
You just jump out into the abyss?

4435
02:15:28,930 --> 02:15:29,370
Yeah.

4436
02:15:30,830 --> 02:15:31,330
Dang.

4437
02:15:32,690 --> 02:15:34,590
Watch your stock don't let it fall!

4438
02:15:35,250 --> 02:15:37,850
Ooh, but what if it does fall?

4439
02:15:37,850 --> 02:15:41,770
Every time someone in this game dies they immediately become like, I don't know the call of the void or some shit.

4440
02:15:42,850 --> 02:15:44,870
Oh, there's a medicinal root!

4441
02:15:45,170 --> 02:15:45,550
Carrot!

4442
02:15:45,670 --> 02:15:46,530
Do you need medicine?

4443
02:15:48,830 --> 02:15:49,350
No.

4444
02:15:49,550 --> 02:15:50,090
Oh, thank you.

4445
02:15:50,090 --> 02:15:51,050
Hey, you are such a feeder.

4446
02:15:56,210 --> 02:15:57,610
I'm just concerned.

4447
02:15:57,690 --> 02:15:58,770
Thank you very much.

4448
02:16:00,070 --> 02:16:02,290
Wow, Snuff, I didn't know you were into that.

4449
02:16:02,710 --> 02:16:02,830
No.

4450
02:16:03,190 --> 02:16:03,430
No.

4451
02:16:04,370 --> 02:16:04,670
No.

4452
02:16:05,250 --> 02:16:05,290
No.

4453
02:16:05,330 --> 02:16:05,330
No.

4454
02:16:06,650 --> 02:16:09,130
That's why she's carrying the thick mints.

4455
02:16:09,710 --> 02:16:11,230
Oh, extra thick.

4456
02:16:14,790 --> 02:16:15,670
Thank you.

4457
02:16:15,910 --> 02:16:18,870
Oh, this is so straightforward.

4458
02:16:19,350 --> 02:16:19,810
This is good.

4459
02:16:20,090 --> 02:16:20,890
Yeah, this is nice.

4460
02:16:21,490 --> 02:16:25,090
It only took two of our friends fucking dying to get over here.

4461
02:16:25,270 --> 02:16:26,570
But you can't climb up from there.

4462
02:16:27,630 --> 02:16:28,590
I wasn't.

4463
02:16:29,550 --> 02:16:31,170
My death could have been...

4464
02:16:31,170 --> 02:16:33,090
My death could have been avoided.

4465
02:16:33,270 --> 02:16:35,390
No, my death could have been avoided.

4466
02:16:36,210 --> 02:16:37,510
There's a luggage over there.

4467
02:16:37,890 --> 02:16:38,270
What are you talking about?

4468
02:16:38,430 --> 02:16:40,010
You literally caused it yourself.

4469
02:16:40,690 --> 02:16:42,390
There's a luggage to your left side.

4470
02:16:44,030 --> 02:16:45,970
Okay, just trying to find a good path.

4471
02:16:46,890 --> 02:16:48,710
Do you think we make this vine climb?

4472
02:16:48,710 --> 02:16:49,330
I...

4473
02:16:50,650 --> 02:16:51,170
Yeah.

4474
02:16:51,470 --> 02:16:52,290
I think so.

4475
02:16:52,330 --> 02:16:52,990
I think so.

4476
02:16:52,990 --> 02:16:53,070
I think so.

4477
02:16:54,130 --> 02:16:54,490
Yeah.

4478
02:16:54,810 --> 02:16:55,710
Do you have good stat?

4479
02:16:56,290 --> 02:16:57,330
You got any extra?

4480
02:16:58,170 --> 02:16:58,690
Do it.

4481
02:16:58,690 --> 02:16:58,850
Do it.

4482
02:17:17,590 --> 02:17:18,630
Do it.

4483
02:17:25,190 --> 02:17:27,850
Maybe, but...

4484
02:17:30,770 --> 02:17:32,170
Alright...

4485
02:17:32,170 --> 02:17:44,710
If you were watching...

4486
02:17:47,210 --> 02:17:48,610
What were you avoiding...

4487
02:17:48,610 --> 02:17:49,850
Oh, I love the boy.

4488
02:17:52,330 --> 02:17:53,890
Oh, that was close.

4489
02:17:54,070 --> 02:17:55,350
I broke my shins a little bit.

4490
02:18:01,670 --> 02:18:03,190
Oh my god, thank you.

4491
02:18:04,370 --> 02:18:05,550
I thought you were gone.

4492
02:18:05,750 --> 02:18:07,650
I think I was in shock for a second.

4493
02:18:07,770 --> 02:18:10,110
I saw that.

4494
02:18:10,250 --> 02:18:11,470
I saw that.

4495
02:18:13,450 --> 02:18:14,410
Something literally...

4496
02:18:15,110 --> 02:18:16,550
Something literally paused.

4497
02:18:16,550 --> 02:18:17,450
It's gradual damage.

4498
02:18:19,090 --> 02:18:21,030
Oh, I can't see because of the fog.

4499
02:18:21,190 --> 02:18:21,730
This sucks.

4500
02:18:22,110 --> 02:18:23,830
Oh, Snuffy went the wrong way.

4501
02:18:24,130 --> 02:18:24,830
I think we're under a tree.

4502
02:18:25,390 --> 02:18:27,270
No, Snuffy went the wrong way.

4503
02:18:27,710 --> 02:18:29,230
Come up this way.

4504
02:18:29,490 --> 02:18:32,090
Oh my god, Snuffy is eating.

4505
02:18:32,210 --> 02:18:33,010
No, the left rock!

4506
02:18:33,130 --> 02:18:33,810
The left rock!

4507
02:18:41,900 --> 02:18:43,220
No, the wrong way!

4508
02:18:43,440 --> 02:18:44,960
The wrong way, Snuffy!

4509
02:18:45,200 --> 02:18:46,820
This way, this way, this way!

4510
02:18:46,980 --> 02:18:48,220
No, the back rock!

4511
02:18:48,340 --> 02:18:49,100
She's damaging!

4512
02:18:52,720 --> 02:18:52,860
Oh, oh!

4513
02:18:52,860 --> 02:18:54,980
Oh, Snuffy is patting me!

4514
02:18:55,300 --> 02:18:56,740
Now, Snuffy, no!

4515
02:18:57,180 --> 02:18:57,680
No!

4516
02:18:58,400 --> 02:18:58,460
No değil!

4517
02:19:00,980 --> 02:19:01,620
Yes!

4518
02:19:01,900 --> 02:19:02,040
Croware.

4519
02:19:02,220 --> 02:19:03,120
Yes, Crocule dies with her!

4520
02:19:03,440 --> 02:19:04,060
Yes!

4521
02:19:05,620 --> 02:19:07,340
Crocule dies with her!

4522
02:19:10,160 --> 02:19:10,800
Yes!

4523
02:19:11,120 --> 02:19:11,240
Yes!

4524
02:19:11,400 --> 02:19:12,320
Throw Crocule off!

4525
02:19:12,440 --> 02:19:13,940
Throw Crocule off before you die!

4526
02:19:14,560 --> 02:19:14,580
No!

4527
02:19:15,540 --> 02:19:15,980
Yes!

4528
02:19:16,160 --> 02:19:16,620
Throw him on!

4529
02:19:16,820 --> 02:19:17,640
Throw Crocule off!

4530
02:19:18,460 --> 02:19:19,280
That's it!

4531
02:19:20,420 --> 02:19:21,360
He's sniffing.

4532
02:19:21,480 --> 02:19:22,000
He's sniffing.

4533
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:24,980
Alright Diamond drin, it's up to you!

4534
02:19:26,320 --> 02:19:28,100
I think we went the wrong way.

4535
02:19:28,420 --> 02:19:28,700
It sucks here.

4536
02:19:29,120 --> 02:19:31,420
I think- I think maybe we made a wrong turn.

4537
02:19:31,580 --> 02:19:33,980
I think we went the wrong way... I think we should- Oh right.

4538
02:19:33,980 --> 02:19:33,980
Wait.

4539
02:19:34,140 --> 02:19:34,480
To the right.

4540
02:19:34,580 --> 02:19:36,480
There's still a far ways away too.

4541
02:19:36,860 --> 02:19:37,300
Oh gosh.

4542
02:19:37,660 --> 02:19:37,920
Yeah.

4543
02:19:38,360 --> 02:19:40,780
I think the right way was- Go on, they're so fast!

4544
02:19:41,480 --> 02:19:43,680
I think we were just really slow.

4545
02:19:45,060 --> 02:19:47,940
Yeah, we kinda like meandered around a little bit.

4546
02:19:48,460 --> 02:19:50,900
I think the right way was the right way.

4547
02:19:50,900 --> 02:19:51,180
Yeah.

4548
02:19:55,000 --> 02:19:56,520
No, no, you can make it.

4549
02:19:56,800 --> 02:19:57,360
I believe.

4550
02:19:57,780 --> 02:19:58,780
I think you guys should have grabbed the vine.

4551
02:20:01,540 --> 02:20:02,540
I grabbed it.

4552
02:20:02,680 --> 02:20:03,460
I grabbed it.

4553
02:20:03,760 --> 02:20:05,100
It was... No, look at this.

4554
02:20:05,160 --> 02:20:06,000
I think this is a tree.

4555
02:20:06,240 --> 02:20:06,720
Oh, no, no, no.

4556
02:20:06,800 --> 02:20:07,140
Different tree.

4557
02:20:07,260 --> 02:20:07,600
Different tree.

4558
02:20:08,240 --> 02:20:08,720
Never mind.

4559
02:20:08,900 --> 02:20:09,440
It has bees.

4560
02:20:09,800 --> 02:20:10,620
There's the bees.

4561
02:20:10,900 --> 02:20:11,520
There's the bees.

4562
02:20:11,520 --> 02:20:13,020
It is a bee tree, but I think it's a different bee tree.

4563
02:20:13,120 --> 02:20:14,000
The environment looks different.

4564
02:20:14,400 --> 02:20:15,920
Oh, wait, no.

4565
02:20:16,140 --> 02:20:16,980
Not though, right?

4566
02:20:17,080 --> 02:20:17,220
Bees.

4567
02:20:17,220 --> 02:20:19,640
Oh, that's the same... You touched a spike in the wall.

4568
02:20:20,060 --> 02:20:21,280
That's pretty...

4569
02:20:21,280 --> 02:20:22,480
Oh, it's waning.

4570
02:20:23,820 --> 02:20:25,000
It's waning.

4571
02:20:26,600 --> 02:20:27,820
It's waning.

4572
02:20:28,240 --> 02:20:28,400
It's waning.

4573
02:20:28,400 --> 02:20:29,160
Yeah, it's waning.

4574
02:20:30,360 --> 02:20:31,480
It's waning.

4575
02:20:31,800 --> 02:20:32,300
It's pouring.

4576
02:20:32,680 --> 02:20:34,400
The old man is snoring.

4577
02:20:35,660 --> 02:20:37,160
He hid his head.

4578
02:20:38,160 --> 02:20:42,220
And something sounded something, and came up and went to the...

4579
02:20:43,320 --> 02:20:44,000
Yaay!

4580
02:20:44,620 --> 02:20:46,180
That's the story of me.

4581
02:20:49,360 --> 02:20:53,040
So I don't have... I don't have the same drink I had last time to make this.

4582
02:20:53,140 --> 02:20:55,200
This is exactly the same cliff and I don't have the drink.

4583
02:20:55,640 --> 02:20:58,960
It's okay, you have... Wait, don't you have drink in your backpack?

4584
02:21:00,060 --> 02:21:02,160
No, someone swiped it.

4585
02:21:02,760 --> 02:21:04,340
Who would have done such a thing?

4586
02:21:05,200 --> 02:21:05,820
I don't know.

4587
02:21:06,560 --> 02:21:07,880
Don't talk to her.

4588
02:21:08,700 --> 02:21:10,860
Oh, it was you, wasn't it, Min?

4589
02:21:11,080 --> 02:21:12,380
It was you.

4590
02:21:13,080 --> 02:21:14,900
You swiped it.

4591
02:21:15,720 --> 02:21:17,740
I didn't actually... You swiped it.

4592
02:21:17,740 --> 02:21:19,160
I got a water bottle, but it was in my backpack.

4593
02:21:19,160 --> 02:21:20,060
I would have said I did.

4594
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:21,540
Uh-oh, gosh.

4595
02:21:21,860 --> 02:21:22,200
Oh, gosh.

4596
02:21:22,540 --> 02:21:24,140
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

4597
02:21:24,420 --> 02:21:25,180
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

4598
02:21:25,320 --> 02:21:26,140
Careful, careful.

4599
02:21:26,940 --> 02:21:28,140
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

4600
02:21:29,220 --> 02:21:35,620
Alright, since we're all confessing right now, I may or may not have been the one that swiped the energy drink.

4601
02:21:36,580 --> 02:21:37,640
Oh my god.

4602
02:21:38,700 --> 02:21:40,580
The worst kept secret ever.

4603
02:21:41,320 --> 02:21:43,400
I mean, I kinda watched you do it.

4604
02:21:46,440 --> 02:21:48,340
It may or may...

4605
02:21:48,340 --> 02:21:49,140
She was giving you the time to confess.

4606
02:21:49,360 --> 02:21:49,920
It would may...

4607
02:21:49,920 --> 02:21:50,720
Yeah, and I did!

4608
02:21:51,080 --> 02:21:51,540
And I did!

4609
02:21:51,740 --> 02:21:53,420
And all is forgiven in the eyes of God.

4610
02:21:54,580 --> 02:21:55,060
Oh, okay.

4611
02:21:56,200 --> 02:21:57,720
You're a ghost.

4612
02:21:58,240 --> 02:21:59,120
There is no...

4613
02:21:59,120 --> 02:22:02,380
I just have some unfinished business.

4614
02:22:02,380 --> 02:22:05,940
Ow, ow, ow, ow...

4615
02:22:05,940 --> 02:22:05,960
Ow, ow, ow.

4616
02:22:05,960 --> 02:22:06,040
Oh, oh, ow.

4617
02:22:06,060 --> 02:22:06,820
That's a lot of spikes!

4618
02:22:06,980 --> 02:22:10,480
Fucking rain, fucking rain, fucking rain, fucking rain, fucking rain.

4619
02:22:16,250 --> 02:22:19,230
If I have my drink, this would be so much easier.

4620
02:22:19,770 --> 02:22:21,030
Oh, man, I know, right?

4621
02:22:21,310 --> 02:22:22,730
The character looks so angry.

4622
02:22:22,730 --> 02:22:24,290
So, it's just unfortunate.

4623
02:22:24,590 --> 02:22:25,410
I wouldn't...

4624
02:22:26,810 --> 02:22:27,790
Oh my gosh, you're so close.

4625
02:22:27,810 --> 02:22:28,450
Oh, this is fucked.

4626
02:22:28,590 --> 02:22:29,530
There's like nothing here.

4627
02:22:29,690 --> 02:22:30,510
Yeah, there's a rock.

4628
02:22:30,650 --> 02:22:31,750
There's a rock that has a green patch.

4629
02:22:32,330 --> 02:22:33,410
Get to the left, that rock.

4630
02:22:33,970 --> 02:22:34,470
I see it.

4631
02:22:34,470 --> 02:22:34,510
I see it.

4632
02:22:34,710 --> 02:22:35,150
I see it.

4633
02:22:35,370 --> 02:22:35,950
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4634
02:22:36,070 --> 02:22:37,310
And then you can climb up that.

4635
02:22:37,390 --> 02:22:37,830
There you go.

4636
02:22:37,990 --> 02:22:39,370
And then all is for Giffin.

4637
02:22:42,170 --> 02:22:42,490
Oh,

4638
02:22:46,790 --> 02:22:47,490
that was so close.

4639
02:22:49,310 --> 02:22:49,630
Alright.

4640
02:22:50,010 --> 02:22:51,290
And then you just gotta climb that.

4641
02:22:51,770 --> 02:22:53,950
I don't want to worry you but the fog cometh.

4642
02:22:54,450 --> 02:22:55,510
Yeah, but it's not Okay.

4643
02:22:55,630 --> 02:22:57,650
The fog cometh and the fog can take you.

4644
02:22:58,350 --> 02:22:59,390
So you made it!

4645
02:22:59,550 --> 02:23:00,090
I did take you.

4646
02:23:00,330 --> 02:23:01,430
You made it!

4647
02:23:01,570 --> 02:23:02,250
You're at the top.

4648
02:23:03,070 --> 02:23:03,350
Woo!

4649
02:23:03,410 --> 02:23:03,850
Oh my god.

4650
02:23:04,950 --> 02:23:06,130
We did it.

4651
02:23:08,950 --> 02:23:11,470
I feed Lima and she carried us.

4652
02:23:11,750 --> 02:23:11,910
Yeah!

4653
02:23:12,530 --> 02:23:13,530
We did woo!

4654
02:23:14,150 --> 02:23:14,590
Yay!

4655
02:23:14,870 --> 02:23:15,030
Oh my god.

4656
02:23:15,030 --> 02:23:16,110
We were all there.

4657
02:23:16,650 --> 02:23:17,070
Oh my god!

4658
02:23:17,470 --> 02:23:17,830
Oh my god!

4659
02:23:17,850 --> 02:23:18,970
We were all there!

4660
02:23:18,970 --> 02:23:21,250
Oh my god!

4661
02:23:21,650 --> 02:23:22,530
We're heroes!

4662
02:23:25,210 --> 02:23:25,730
Yay!

4663
02:23:27,310 --> 02:23:28,070
I'm back.

4664
02:23:28,330 --> 02:23:29,010
Welcome back, everybody.

4665
02:23:30,890 --> 02:23:32,590
You still have that open?

4666
02:23:32,730 --> 02:23:34,910
Yeah, that suitcase is still up there.

4667
02:23:36,970 --> 02:23:38,810
How do you get that?

4668
02:23:39,090 --> 02:23:39,810
I don't know.

4669
02:23:40,070 --> 02:23:41,250
You can't climb this, too.

4670
02:23:42,070 --> 02:23:45,450
I think it was just generated, like, fucked up.

4671
02:23:46,690 --> 02:23:46,910
Yeah.

4672
02:23:47,570 --> 02:23:48,630
There's a backpack here.

4673
02:23:48,970 --> 02:23:50,050
Corral boost!

4674
02:23:54,770 --> 02:23:55,750
Wait a minute.

4675
02:23:56,470 --> 02:23:59,150
So are you guys gonna see the capybaras this time?

4676
02:23:59,430 --> 02:24:01,450
Oh yeah, I wanna see a capybara!

4677
02:24:01,810 --> 02:24:01,990
Yeah.

4678
02:24:03,470 --> 02:24:04,430
Gotta go fast.

4679
02:24:04,970 --> 02:24:08,570
Unfortunately, I had just died, so we don't have gungle or the trumpet.

4680
02:24:09,010 --> 02:24:09,410
Yeah.

4681
02:24:12,210 --> 02:24:13,430
Oh, can I cook the herbs?

4682
02:24:14,130 --> 02:24:14,530
Can you?

4683
02:24:14,990 --> 02:24:15,470
Herbs!

4684
02:24:18,370 --> 02:24:19,910
I wonder where one of them went.

4685
02:24:21,090 --> 02:24:21,530
Hmm.

4686
02:24:24,150 --> 02:24:27,130
I wonder what happened to the other marshmallow, too.

4687
02:24:28,550 --> 02:24:28,950
Hmm.

4688
02:24:29,730 --> 02:24:29,730
Hmm.

4689
02:24:30,230 --> 02:24:30,230
Hmm.

4690
02:24:30,710 --> 02:24:31,030
Hmm.

4691
02:24:31,330 --> 02:24:31,330
Hmm.

4692
02:24:33,610 --> 02:24:34,010
Huh.

4693
02:24:34,010 --> 02:24:34,010
Nah.

4694
02:24:34,750 --> 02:24:35,030
Funny.

4695
02:24:35,250 --> 02:24:36,550
You guys are gonna get overtaken.

4696
02:24:36,810 --> 02:24:36,890
I'm climbing.

4697
02:24:37,450 --> 02:24:38,910
The freezing ears.

4698
02:24:40,450 --> 02:24:41,270
You know what?

4699
02:24:41,470 --> 02:24:43,770
By the time I get my... I got Invisalign in.

4700
02:24:43,910 --> 02:24:47,310
By the time I get those out, it's gonna feel weird to have my teeth actually be able to touch each other.

4701
02:24:47,310 --> 02:24:51,370
Like, I'm just gonna be uncomfortable and, like, for anything else with my own mouth.

4702
02:24:51,950 --> 02:24:53,710
That sounds... What's Invisalon?

4703
02:24:53,910 --> 02:24:55,590
It's like braces, but better.

4704
02:24:56,850 --> 02:24:59,050
They're, like, a retainer, like, right?

4705
02:24:59,470 --> 02:24:59,790
Yeah.

4706
02:25:00,270 --> 02:25:00,430
Huh?

4707
02:25:01,010 --> 02:25:03,550
It's kind of like, like, it covers your whole mouth, right?

4708
02:25:04,510 --> 02:25:05,230
It's cold.

4709
02:25:05,290 --> 02:25:09,850
It's like a little plastic tray that your teeth, like, uh...

4710
02:25:09,850 --> 02:25:10,750
sits around your teeth.

4711
02:25:10,930 --> 02:25:12,250
It's molded to the shape of your teeth.

4712
02:25:13,450 --> 02:25:14,790
Is it still cold?

4713
02:25:15,190 --> 02:25:16,910
How much to buy your yeast Invisalon?

4714
02:25:18,390 --> 02:25:21,850
It's a lot more expensive than regular braces, from what I've heard.

4715
02:25:23,930 --> 02:25:24,690
It... depends.

4716
02:25:27,450 --> 02:25:28,830
Like... Yeah, there's another suitcase.

4717
02:25:28,990 --> 02:25:29,650
Oh, there's that suit.

4718
02:25:29,730 --> 02:25:30,630
I remember that suitcase.

4719
02:25:31,130 --> 02:25:31,650
I'm heading over.

4720
02:25:32,070 --> 02:25:32,250
Yeah.

4721
02:25:32,950 --> 02:25:36,930
I don't think it's even more subtle than normal braces if they put enough attachments in, which I have.

4722
02:25:38,170 --> 02:25:38,550
Uh...

4723
02:25:38,550 --> 02:25:40,730
You get, like, sparkles and, like...

4724
02:25:40,730 --> 02:25:44,110
Oh, yeah, did you add, like, stickers on it or something, like...

4725
02:25:44,970 --> 02:25:46,090
...can you bling it?

4726
02:25:48,810 --> 02:25:51,010
...can you put, like, bling on it?

4727
02:25:51,750 --> 02:25:52,970
Like, bedazzle it?

4728
02:25:53,270 --> 02:25:54,210
I don't know, actually.

4729
02:25:54,550 --> 02:25:54,810
Yeah!

4730
02:25:55,370 --> 02:25:56,750
If you can bedazzle it.

4731
02:25:58,190 --> 02:25:58,970
I think, like, yeah.

4732
02:25:59,470 --> 02:25:59,870
Oh, wait, wait.

4733
02:25:59,930 --> 02:26:00,670
I might actually die.

4734
02:26:00,770 --> 02:26:01,190
Oh, I'm okay.

4735
02:26:01,290 --> 02:26:01,630
I'm okay!

4736
02:26:02,990 --> 02:26:03,510
I'm okay!

4737
02:26:05,950 --> 02:26:07,570
Wait, that's a medicinal road?

4738
02:26:07,750 --> 02:26:07,810
Gimme!

4739
02:26:09,890 --> 02:26:11,130
Oh, I stubbed my toe.

4740
02:26:11,310 --> 02:26:12,510
When did I stub my toe?

4741
02:26:12,510 --> 02:26:12,610
I don't know.

4742
02:26:13,430 --> 02:26:14,250
It didn't feel!

4743
02:26:23,770 --> 02:26:24,190
Yeah!

4744
02:26:24,730 --> 02:26:25,050
Really?

4745
02:26:25,290 --> 02:26:27,210
We can go cave dive and see it through to the end!

4746
02:26:27,410 --> 02:26:27,870
Oh, my God!

4747
02:26:28,050 --> 02:26:29,630
We can finally, we can cave dive!

4748
02:26:29,990 --> 02:26:31,370
That's what our boys wanted!

4749
02:26:32,350 --> 02:26:32,930
...execute me.

4750
02:26:33,110 --> 02:26:34,590
Min, did you not cook your marshmallow?

4751
02:26:35,630 --> 02:26:36,710
It was you.

4752
02:26:40,330 --> 02:26:42,690
You totally didn't steal that marshmallow.

4753
02:26:42,730 --> 02:26:43,930
It was you.

4754
02:26:44,510 --> 02:26:46,530
It was you.

4755
02:26:46,910 --> 02:26:48,570
It was you!

4756
02:26:48,570 --> 02:26:50,790
You bastard!

4757
02:26:52,490 --> 02:26:54,270
I'll remember this.

4758
02:26:54,950 --> 02:26:56,550
I remembered already.

4759
02:26:57,730 --> 02:26:59,810
Why do you think it was gone?

4760
02:27:01,730 --> 02:27:03,450
Oh, it was just us, too.

4761
02:27:04,210 --> 02:27:05,930
It would be a shame if something happened.

4762
02:27:06,530 --> 02:27:08,110
I'll push you into the store.

4763
02:27:08,650 --> 02:27:09,810
Nobody will see.

4764
02:27:09,810 --> 02:27:09,870
Nobody will see.

4765
02:27:09,870 --> 02:27:10,270
Nobody will hear you die.

4766
02:27:10,770 --> 02:27:12,190
Nobody will hear you scream.

4767
02:27:12,890 --> 02:27:16,050
It's like, if a tree falls down an empty forest.

4768
02:27:16,630 --> 02:27:17,150
Oh,

4769
02:27:25,170 --> 02:27:25,510
my God.

4770
02:27:25,650 --> 02:27:27,430
There has to be more food somewhere.

4771
02:27:28,130 --> 02:27:32,710
I think we should go to the way that we were going before Snuffy and I died.

4772
02:27:33,890 --> 02:27:34,450
Yeah.

4773
02:27:35,110 --> 02:27:36,350
Oh, there's food right here.

4774
02:27:36,870 --> 02:27:37,970
Oh, you got some.

4775
02:27:38,370 --> 02:27:39,170
That's right.

4776
02:27:39,510 --> 02:27:41,030
I got some oranges.

4777
02:27:42,390 --> 02:27:43,770
Some orange eyes.

4778
02:27:44,390 --> 02:27:45,870
I have a marshmallow.

4779
02:27:46,170 --> 02:27:46,610
It's really yummy.

4780
02:27:47,830 --> 02:27:50,110
I don't need your stupid marshmallows.

4781
02:27:50,410 --> 02:27:52,550
I have nature to save me.

4782
02:27:52,910 --> 02:27:53,710
Oh, shoot.

4783
02:27:53,830 --> 02:27:54,250
Oh, shoot.

4784
02:27:54,250 --> 02:27:54,330
Oh, shoot.

4785
02:27:54,810 --> 02:27:55,210
Oh, no.

4786
02:27:55,430 --> 02:27:55,930
Oh, no.

4787
02:27:56,250 --> 02:27:57,950
Oh, no.

4788
02:27:58,190 --> 02:27:58,770
That's right.

4789
02:28:02,890 --> 02:28:04,150
You can't have it.

4790
02:28:04,330 --> 02:28:05,830
Take it from my dead hands.

4791
02:28:06,030 --> 02:28:08,210
I'm gonna fucking... I'm gonna choke you.

4792
02:28:08,350 --> 02:28:10,910
I'm gonna choke you and no one will know.

4793
02:28:11,510 --> 02:28:12,610
No one will...

4794
02:28:12,610 --> 02:28:13,570
That's right.

4795
02:28:13,570 --> 02:28:14,630
I took it.

4796
02:28:16,130 --> 02:28:17,510
You didn't take it.

4797
02:28:18,670 --> 02:28:20,390
Do you get the boost from it?

4798
02:28:21,130 --> 02:28:21,650
Yeah.

4799
02:28:22,650 --> 02:28:22,910
Okay.

4800
02:28:23,890 --> 02:28:24,710
Wait, where are they?

4801
02:28:25,010 --> 02:28:26,330
It was a science experiment.

4802
02:28:26,330 --> 02:28:26,650
Hello.

4803
02:28:27,970 --> 02:28:28,330
Hello.

4804
02:28:28,710 --> 02:28:30,790
Wait, where... Don't forget capybars to the left.

4805
02:28:31,610 --> 02:28:32,510
Wait, where's the capybars?

4806
02:28:32,570 --> 02:28:33,930
I want to see the capybars.

4807
02:28:34,250 --> 02:28:35,270
I didn't get to see them.

4808
02:28:36,390 --> 02:28:37,310
I'm heading over.

4809
02:28:37,870 --> 02:28:38,110
Run.

4810
02:28:38,110 --> 02:28:39,930
Get there before the storm comes.

4811
02:28:40,510 --> 02:28:42,150
Wait, does it affect you when you're in there?

4812
02:28:42,390 --> 02:28:43,350
When you're in the storm?

4813
02:28:43,730 --> 02:28:44,430
No, it doesn't.

4814
02:28:44,450 --> 02:28:46,030
Yeah, as long as you're in the water, you're okay.

4815
02:28:46,230 --> 02:28:47,430
Oh, is that them right there?

4816
02:28:47,610 --> 02:28:47,950
Oh, my God.

4817
02:28:48,110 --> 02:28:49,530
They're so easy to get there.

4818
02:28:49,530 --> 02:28:49,530
Yeah.

4819
02:28:49,690 --> 02:28:50,630
Yeah, they're right there.

4820
02:28:53,850 --> 02:28:54,810
Oh, my God.

4821
02:28:55,150 --> 02:28:57,830
I want to... I want to be there with the capybaras.

4822
02:28:58,130 --> 02:28:59,130
I'm tired.

4823
02:28:59,410 --> 02:29:00,370
I'm so tired.

4824
02:29:00,710 --> 02:29:01,050
This way.

4825
02:29:01,490 --> 02:29:02,070
This way.

4826
02:29:02,750 --> 02:29:04,630
Hello, little capybaras.

4827
02:29:04,750 --> 02:29:05,410
I am here.

4828
02:29:06,090 --> 02:29:07,610
I hope they don't touch the lava.

4829
02:29:07,790 --> 02:29:09,810
They're awfully close to lava.

4830
02:29:10,310 --> 02:29:11,190
Oh, my God.

4831
02:29:11,190 --> 02:29:12,390
They're so cute.

4832
02:29:13,570 --> 02:29:15,110
Oh, eat it.

4833
02:29:16,650 --> 02:29:17,950
Just stay in the water.

4834
02:29:18,190 --> 02:29:19,390
It doesn't hurt you in here, no.

4835
02:29:19,910 --> 02:29:20,390
Yeah.

4836
02:29:24,610 --> 02:29:25,890
We're so safe.

4837
02:29:26,890 --> 02:29:27,830
Why is it purple?

4838
02:29:27,850 --> 02:29:28,690
I wish we had the blue one.

4839
02:29:29,030 --> 02:29:31,330
It's like a... It's a hot spring.

4840
02:29:31,910 --> 02:29:32,030
What the heck?

4841
02:29:33,050 --> 02:29:33,490
Maybe...

4842
02:29:33,490 --> 02:29:35,770
Maybe the pH level is changed.

4843
02:29:35,990 --> 02:29:35,990
Oh, yeah.

4844
02:29:35,990 --> 02:29:36,870
It's reflecting the clouds.

4845
02:29:36,910 --> 02:29:37,170
Wait.

4846
02:29:37,450 --> 02:29:38,570
Is green bad?

4847
02:29:38,870 --> 02:29:40,090
Yeah, the green...

4848
02:29:40,090 --> 02:29:40,330
Shut up.

4849
02:29:44,730 --> 02:29:47,170
The P levels are high because I was in there.

4850
02:29:47,690 --> 02:29:50,950
Guys, I think we should go to where Snuffy and I were at before.

4851
02:29:51,650 --> 02:29:52,550
Which was?

4852
02:29:52,970 --> 02:29:53,210
Yeah, okay.

4853
02:29:53,910 --> 02:29:54,950
It's over towards the left.

4854
02:29:55,470 --> 02:29:55,610
Yeah.

4855
02:29:56,450 --> 02:29:58,270
The other way seems really difficult.

4856
02:29:59,570 --> 02:30:00,010
It was.

4857
02:30:03,830 --> 02:30:05,370
What are you guys...

4858
02:30:05,370 --> 02:30:06,910
cackling about?

4859
02:30:07,170 --> 02:30:07,730
Nothing.

4860
02:30:07,730 --> 02:30:07,850
Nothing.

4861
02:30:07,850 --> 02:30:10,370
I think you should find my tree and tickle my bird eggs.

4862
02:30:11,430 --> 02:30:12,110
Nothing.

4863
02:30:13,450 --> 02:30:14,050
Nothing.

4864
02:30:14,510 --> 02:30:14,970
Nothing.

4865
02:30:17,930 --> 02:30:18,610
Alright.

4866
02:30:19,110 --> 02:30:22,030
You want me to feed you and satisfy your fetish?

4867
02:30:23,130 --> 02:30:23,390
What the?

4868
02:30:23,450 --> 02:30:24,150
You want me...

4869
02:30:24,150 --> 02:30:25,210
I'm feeding.

4870
02:30:25,570 --> 02:30:26,010
I'm feeding.

4871
02:30:27,030 --> 02:30:27,650
Yum, yum, yum, yum.

4872
02:30:28,830 --> 02:30:31,390
Oh, you liked watching, didn't you?

4873
02:30:32,890 --> 02:30:34,770
I don't know what I was watching.

4874
02:30:36,710 --> 02:30:38,570
I don't know what I was witnessing.

4875
02:30:39,250 --> 02:30:41,650
Does someone have the other heel root, perhaps?

4876
02:30:42,650 --> 02:30:43,870
Oh, there's...

4877
02:30:43,870 --> 02:30:44,510
I need it.

4878
02:30:45,190 --> 02:30:46,290
What happened to you?

4879
02:30:46,450 --> 02:30:47,030
I have this.

4880
02:30:47,590 --> 02:30:48,050
No?

4881
02:30:48,370 --> 02:30:48,870
I don't have it.

4882
02:30:48,930 --> 02:30:48,990
Okay.

4883
02:30:49,650 --> 02:30:50,130
Okay.

4884
02:30:50,430 --> 02:30:50,990
I have this.

4885
02:30:51,230 --> 02:30:52,130
Is this what you wanted?

4886
02:30:53,610 --> 02:30:54,090
Yeah.

4887
02:30:54,370 --> 02:30:55,470
Could you feed it to me?

4888
02:30:56,070 --> 02:30:56,430
Yeah.

4889
02:30:56,430 --> 02:30:57,170
He said, please?

4890
02:30:57,190 --> 02:30:58,030
I fell on my butt.

4891
02:30:58,270 --> 02:30:58,850
Please.

4892
02:30:59,950 --> 02:31:00,910
Please what?

4893
02:31:01,250 --> 02:31:01,590
Get in!

4894
02:31:01,710 --> 02:31:02,070
Get in!

4895
02:31:02,510 --> 02:31:04,530
Please feed me the root, ducky.

4896
02:31:08,110 --> 02:31:09,190
There you go.

4897
02:31:09,470 --> 02:31:09,490
Thank you.

4898
02:31:09,970 --> 02:31:10,890
You did it.

4899
02:31:13,090 --> 02:31:14,690
I don't know that he fucking fried.

4900
02:31:15,730 --> 02:31:16,370
Oh,

4901
02:31:19,810 --> 02:31:21,010
nice jump.

4902
02:31:21,610 --> 02:31:22,150
Whoa.

4903
02:31:22,530 --> 02:31:23,070
Parkour!

4904
02:31:23,950 --> 02:31:24,550
Parkour!

4905
02:31:25,090 --> 02:31:25,730
Parkour!

4906
02:31:26,610 --> 02:31:27,630
Parkour, stop!

4907
02:31:27,950 --> 02:31:28,430
Parkour!

4908
02:31:29,090 --> 02:31:30,290
Get outta my way!

4909
02:31:31,450 --> 02:31:32,370
Get outta my head!

4910
02:31:32,610 --> 02:31:33,250
Get outta my head!

4911
02:31:34,570 --> 02:31:37,630
This is gonna require ultimate teamwork together.

4912
02:31:38,670 --> 02:31:39,290
I believe.

4913
02:31:39,690 --> 02:31:41,030
I don't remember even where me and Min were.

4914
02:31:41,710 --> 02:31:42,190
Me too.

4915
02:31:42,190 --> 02:31:44,630
It was like... I don't remember either, actually.

4916
02:31:44,850 --> 02:31:46,570
Is this the right way, Scoutmaster?

4917
02:31:46,870 --> 02:31:47,290
Cause you're hugging.

4918
02:31:47,430 --> 02:31:49,510
I mean, it looks pretty good, honestly.

4919
02:31:50,230 --> 02:31:51,190
I have no idea.

4920
02:31:51,390 --> 02:31:53,370
I'd go by based on tools and vibes.

4921
02:31:55,510 --> 02:31:56,710
Has it been working?

4922
02:31:57,010 --> 02:31:57,790
I don't need a map or a compass.

4923
02:31:58,210 --> 02:31:58,990
I got vibes.

4924
02:31:59,070 --> 02:31:59,870
I got my vibes.

4925
02:32:00,750 --> 02:32:02,810
My body tells me this is the right way.

4926
02:32:04,150 --> 02:32:05,330
The wind is blowing.

4927
02:32:05,590 --> 02:32:06,450
I can smell it.

4928
02:32:08,370 --> 02:32:09,250
You go here?

4929
02:32:11,710 --> 02:32:12,650
Where are you going?

4930
02:32:12,990 --> 02:32:13,750
I have no idea.

4931
02:32:13,930 --> 02:32:16,070
I'm going... I'm listening to a Scoutmaster.

4932
02:32:16,330 --> 02:32:16,430
Whoa!

4933
02:32:17,130 --> 02:32:17,790
Me too.

4934
02:32:17,990 --> 02:32:22,750
Also, is the implication that the Scoutmaster is actually a psychopath and has put us through this trial on purpose?

4935
02:32:22,750 --> 02:32:25,270
Because the campfire is set up with marshmallows at the top every time?

4936
02:32:25,950 --> 02:32:29,130
Well, when you told me that he comes and attacks us, I was like...

4937
02:32:29,130 --> 02:32:33,770
Yeah, he's like... So does he have, like, anti-air or some shit that blew up our plane?

4938
02:32:34,090 --> 02:32:37,710
We... Yeah, we could've... We could've been saved this whole time, but...

4939
02:32:37,710 --> 02:32:38,030
Yeah!

4940
02:32:38,410 --> 02:32:39,910
Scoutmaster wants this for us.

4941
02:32:40,010 --> 02:32:41,670
Yeah, like, he has anti-air.

4942
02:32:42,130 --> 02:32:45,690
Yeah, if you... If you climb ahead of your friends, which is, uh...

4943
02:32:45,690 --> 02:32:49,010
While I was waiting for Snuffy on the last map, if you climb too far ahead, he spawned...

4944
02:32:49,010 --> 02:32:52,650
Oh my god, that means I could've died earlier when I was climbing ahead.

4945
02:32:53,370 --> 02:32:55,650
I was kinda waiting for it to happen, yeah.

4946
02:32:56,850 --> 02:32:57,890
Wait, this is safe.

4947
02:32:58,550 --> 02:33:00,130
We can all just leave Doki behind.

4948
02:33:00,470 --> 02:33:00,990
Wait, what?

4949
02:33:01,370 --> 02:33:02,810
Wait, I'm literally right here!

4950
02:33:03,030 --> 02:33:03,230
Wait...

4951
02:33:03,230 --> 02:33:04,910
I'm literally right here!

4952
02:33:04,910 --> 02:33:06,890
Being left behind doesn't make him show up.

4953
02:33:07,750 --> 02:33:09,430
That's it, I'm angry, I'm eating this.

4954
02:33:09,830 --> 02:33:11,390
I'm yum, yum, yum, yum.

4955
02:33:14,710 --> 02:33:15,990
I'm gonna eat my anger.

4956
02:33:16,230 --> 02:33:17,930
There's actually so much food on this mountain, holy crap.

4957
02:33:18,150 --> 02:33:19,470
You're not you when you're hungry.

4958
02:33:19,650 --> 02:33:19,990
Yeah.

4959
02:33:22,690 --> 02:33:23,130
Mmm...

4960
02:33:23,130 --> 02:33:23,270
Maybe I'm here.

4961
02:33:23,270 --> 02:33:24,370
We go left or right?

4962
02:33:25,290 --> 02:33:25,630
Okay.

4963
02:33:25,930 --> 02:33:27,650
Oh, I see a suitcase down there.

4964
02:33:27,810 --> 02:33:30,050
Yeah, I see a suitcase there too, but is it worth it?

4965
02:33:31,010 --> 02:33:31,650
I don't know.

4966
02:33:33,110 --> 02:33:34,530
There's nowhere to go left.

4967
02:33:34,550 --> 02:33:35,910
I think that, that, that much is clear.

4968
02:33:35,910 --> 02:33:37,970
Maybe, can we climb this tree and jump to here?

4969
02:33:38,490 --> 02:33:39,170
That seems kinda flushed.

4970
02:33:39,190 --> 02:33:42,530
Mmm, Scoutmasters, you're- Oh, there's a thuggish down, right down there.

4971
02:33:44,910 --> 02:33:45,950
Wait, is she dead?

4972
02:33:47,930 --> 02:33:49,730
Oh, she's okay, she's okay.

4973
02:33:50,370 --> 02:33:51,610
I don't think we can climb that.

4974
02:33:52,050 --> 02:33:54,030
The branches, you cannot grab, guys.

4975
02:33:54,350 --> 02:33:55,110
I just wanna- Okay.

4976
02:33:55,830 --> 02:33:56,590
You cannot grab.

4977
02:33:57,330 --> 02:33:58,950
There is a suitcase all over there.

4978
02:33:59,070 --> 02:34:00,690
Wait, so we can't touch the pretty blue crystal either?

4979
02:34:01,150 --> 02:34:02,550
They turn, they freeze you.

4980
02:34:03,470 --> 02:34:03,550
Oh.

4981
02:34:03,590 --> 02:34:04,950
Oh, so what do we do?

4982
02:34:05,350 --> 02:34:06,210
We just go down?

4983
02:34:06,510 --> 02:34:08,070
I mean, you can touch them briefly.

4984
02:34:08,790 --> 02:34:10,030
Does anyone have rope?

4985
02:34:11,690 --> 02:34:13,470
Like, don't we have a chaingun or something?

4986
02:34:13,730 --> 02:34:16,630
We have- We have- I don't think anyone grabbed the chaingun.

4987
02:34:17,630 --> 02:34:17,950
What?

4988
02:34:18,150 --> 02:34:19,790
How did nobody grab the chaingun?

4989
02:34:19,950 --> 02:34:21,910
I guess nobody grabbed the chaingun.

4990
02:34:21,910 --> 02:34:23,030
Where was the chaingun?

4991
02:34:23,750 --> 02:34:25,970
It was in the last map, I thought.

4992
02:34:26,430 --> 02:34:26,870
It was in the last map, I thought.

4993
02:34:26,870 --> 02:34:27,650
Nobody grabbed it.

4994
02:34:28,610 --> 02:34:30,410
Nobody grabbed the chaingun.

4995
02:34:30,950 --> 02:34:34,650
I saw it, but I thought someone with a backpack was gonna grab it.

4996
02:34:35,090 --> 02:34:36,310
I think that was the last one.

4997
02:34:36,430 --> 02:34:37,770
We're just misremembering.

4998
02:34:38,110 --> 02:34:41,370
Yeah, there's two people with backpacks and that's not us, Doki.

4999
02:34:41,470 --> 02:34:42,090
Yeah, it's not us.

5000
02:34:42,150 --> 02:34:42,910
It's not our fun.

5001
02:34:43,130 --> 02:34:43,930
It's not our fun.

5002
02:34:43,930 --> 02:34:46,130
We didn't have room.

5003
02:34:46,870 --> 02:34:47,270
We didn't have room.

5004
02:34:47,270 --> 02:34:48,010
We didn't have room.

5005
02:34:48,070 --> 02:34:49,530
We didn't have room.

5006
02:34:49,530 --> 02:34:50,910
I think we're gonna make like that.

5007
02:34:51,030 --> 02:34:52,870
I have a shelf thing.

5008
02:34:53,070 --> 02:34:53,610
Will that help?

5009
02:34:54,070 --> 02:34:54,990
Oh yeah, that should.

5010
02:34:55,210 --> 02:34:55,290
Maybe.

5011
02:34:55,290 --> 02:34:56,510
Yeah, maybe we could shelf that.

5012
02:34:56,670 --> 02:34:57,130
Oh, wait, wait.

5013
02:34:57,330 --> 02:34:57,770
Pass the shelf.

5014
02:34:57,990 --> 02:35:00,010
I can- Don't worry, I'm MLG.

5015
02:35:00,250 --> 02:35:01,030
Watch this.

5016
02:35:01,290 --> 02:35:01,610
Okay, okay.

5017
02:35:01,930 --> 02:35:02,990
I'm watching, I'm watching.

5018
02:35:02,990 --> 02:35:03,570
Watch this.

5019
02:35:04,590 --> 02:35:04,710
Ha!

5020
02:35:06,250 --> 02:35:06,910
Very good.

5021
02:35:07,350 --> 02:35:09,830
Yeah, and then we grab there and then we get over there.

5022
02:35:10,350 --> 02:35:10,750
Right?

5023
02:35:11,990 --> 02:35:13,290
Wait, that fell the chain launcher.

5024
02:35:13,290 --> 02:35:15,330
I thought we were going- Oh, we have a chain launcher.

5025
02:35:15,530 --> 02:35:15,850
Nevermind.

5026
02:35:15,970 --> 02:35:16,890
Oh, you found the chain launcher.

5027
02:35:17,130 --> 02:35:17,970
She has the chain launcher.

5028
02:35:18,250 --> 02:35:19,550
Okay, maybe we go to the shelf and then go there.

5029
02:35:19,670 --> 02:35:20,870
Either way, I think we want this.

5030
02:35:21,850 --> 02:35:22,170
Okay.

5031
02:35:22,690 --> 02:35:23,150
What do we want?

5032
02:35:23,570 --> 02:35:25,330
Okay, we get to the- We climb to the shelf.

5033
02:35:25,510 --> 02:35:25,810
Okay, okay.

5034
02:35:26,250 --> 02:35:27,550
Alright, who's doing- You can do it, Snuffy.

5035
02:35:28,790 --> 02:35:29,110
Snuffy!

5036
02:35:29,590 --> 02:35:29,910
Snuffy!

5037
02:35:30,270 --> 02:35:30,590
Snuffy!

5038
02:35:30,590 --> 02:35:31,470
What if I get this?

5039
02:35:31,830 --> 02:35:32,350
Really far.

5040
02:35:32,530 --> 02:35:34,730
Wait, I kinda- Can it work?

5041
02:35:35,010 --> 02:35:35,910
Hold on.

5042
02:35:36,230 --> 02:35:37,070
Wait, what are we doing?

5043
02:35:37,350 --> 02:35:38,050
I think she might.

5044
02:35:38,310 --> 02:35:38,610
She's experimenting.

5045
02:35:39,350 --> 02:35:39,670
Oh?

5046
02:35:40,130 --> 02:35:40,450
Yo!

5047
02:35:40,810 --> 02:35:42,110
Hey, don't get too hasty now.

5048
02:35:42,110 --> 02:35:42,590
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5049
02:35:42,590 --> 02:35:43,890
Don't get too confident there.

5050
02:35:44,010 --> 02:35:45,570
Don't get too overconfident.

5051
02:35:46,210 --> 02:35:47,610
The fog is coming.

5052
02:35:48,370 --> 02:35:49,830
Come on, the fog is coming.

5053
02:35:50,010 --> 02:35:50,810
We can't be- Easy.

5054
02:35:51,330 --> 02:35:51,710
Oh, nice.

5055
02:35:52,170 --> 02:35:53,030
Wait, can we make it?

5056
02:35:57,210 --> 02:36:01,050
I'm gonna rest a little bit before- Oh, that's such a fucking bad timing for the storm.

5057
02:36:01,550 --> 02:36:02,710
No, take it easy, guys!

5058
02:36:06,110 --> 02:36:06,910
Oh, nice.

5059
02:36:08,390 --> 02:36:09,710
Wait, how do I get off this thing?

5060
02:36:09,710 --> 02:36:10,570
You press space.

5061
02:36:11,050 --> 02:36:11,410
Yup.

5062
02:36:11,750 --> 02:36:11,830
Space.

5063
02:36:11,970 --> 02:36:12,330
Space.

5064
02:36:12,330 --> 02:36:12,670
Space bar.

5065
02:36:15,090 --> 02:36:15,450
Okay.

5066
02:36:15,450 --> 02:36:15,790
Are you coming?

5067
02:36:16,130 --> 02:36:17,170
You coming over too?

5068
02:36:17,430 --> 02:36:20,470
I kinda got fucked if I had to jump off the shelter, so I might be scared.

5069
02:36:20,490 --> 02:36:24,170
I tried to put it some way that like- Can we even climb up that?

5070
02:36:25,010 --> 02:36:26,310
No, you can climb up that?

5071
02:36:26,330 --> 02:36:27,330
I think I'm fucked.

5072
02:36:27,990 --> 02:36:28,530
Wait, no!

5073
02:36:28,610 --> 02:36:28,910
No, wait.

5074
02:36:28,990 --> 02:36:29,430
I have rope.

5075
02:36:29,570 --> 02:36:29,930
I have rope.

5076
02:36:30,670 --> 02:36:31,030
Okay.

5077
02:36:31,490 --> 02:36:32,030
That would be cool.

5078
02:36:32,650 --> 02:36:33,250
There's lava.

5079
02:36:33,390 --> 02:36:33,790
There's lava.

5080
02:36:34,410 --> 02:36:35,010
It's fine.

5081
02:36:35,510 --> 02:36:37,230
Imma check that suitcase.

5082
02:36:38,330 --> 02:36:39,210
Oh, woah, woah, woah, woah.

5083
02:36:39,330 --> 02:36:40,630
I'm not gonna check the suitcase.

5084
02:36:41,990 --> 02:36:43,710
Oh, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah.

5085
02:36:44,390 --> 02:36:45,170
I can, yeah.

5086
02:36:45,890 --> 02:36:47,230
Okay, I'm gonna put it- I'm huddled.

5087
02:36:47,370 --> 02:36:48,270
I'm huddled.

5088
02:36:48,390 --> 02:36:49,230
I'm like a penguin.

5089
02:36:49,550 --> 02:36:52,210
You know when a baby penguin's not huddled and it dies?

5090
02:36:52,670 --> 02:36:52,970
Yeah, yeah.

5091
02:36:53,090 --> 02:36:53,730
I hope that's enough.

5092
02:36:54,210 --> 02:36:54,570
Oh.

5093
02:36:54,930 --> 02:36:57,230
Why does the lava not keep us warm?

5094
02:36:57,330 --> 02:36:58,870
I think it does a little bit.

5095
02:36:59,710 --> 02:37:00,070
Wow.

5096
02:37:03,070 --> 02:37:04,930
Okay, I'm going for the suitcase.

5097
02:37:07,330 --> 02:37:08,410
Oh, it's a lantern.

5098
02:37:10,370 --> 02:37:11,990
Does the lantern keep us hot?

5099
02:37:12,590 --> 02:37:13,370
I don't know.

5100
02:37:15,030 --> 02:37:16,030
Oh, we go up.

5101
02:37:20,150 --> 02:37:21,210
What are those?

5102
02:37:22,470 --> 02:37:23,870
Oh, that's a flashbang.

5103
02:37:24,090 --> 02:37:26,090
Yeah, yeah, and she almost ran into the lava.

5104
02:37:26,950 --> 02:37:28,990
Yeah, the one where she almost ran into lava.

5105
02:37:31,950 --> 02:37:33,590
Oh, you can come straight up here.

5106
02:37:34,590 --> 02:37:35,990
Give me your hand.

5107
02:37:36,130 --> 02:37:37,170
Give me your hand.

5108
02:37:37,730 --> 02:37:40,090
Give me your hand.

5109
02:37:40,910 --> 02:37:41,690
There you go.

5110
02:37:41,930 --> 02:37:42,390
I got you.

5111
02:37:42,450 --> 02:37:43,410
I got you.

5112
02:37:43,570 --> 02:37:44,390
I'm okay.

5113
02:37:48,200 --> 02:37:49,460
Maybe I'll climb up here.

5114
02:37:50,900 --> 02:37:51,460
All right.

5115
02:37:51,780 --> 02:37:53,400
Oh, yeah, this is how we do it.

5116
02:37:54,860 --> 02:37:55,360
Oh, nice.

5117
02:37:56,320 --> 02:37:58,540
Yeah, this run is going pretty good right now.

5118
02:38:01,340 --> 02:38:02,100
Is she dead?

5119
02:38:04,560 --> 02:38:05,740
Is she alive?

5120
02:38:05,940 --> 02:38:07,740
I lost all my extra energy.

5121
02:38:08,420 --> 02:38:08,860
Oh, no.

5122
02:38:10,900 --> 02:38:13,060
I'm going to check where to go after this.

5123
02:38:13,680 --> 02:38:14,300
Okay, there you go.

5124
02:38:14,940 --> 02:38:15,740
Come back up, Snuffy.

5125
02:38:15,920 --> 02:38:16,200
I got you.

5126
02:38:18,500 --> 02:38:19,040
I'm okay.

5127
02:38:23,910 --> 02:38:24,350
Wee.

5128
02:38:25,230 --> 02:38:25,690
We're going.

5129
02:38:26,010 --> 02:38:26,390
We're going.

5130
02:38:27,730 --> 02:38:28,190
We're going.

5131
02:38:28,190 --> 02:38:28,490
Oh, yeah.

5132
02:38:29,790 --> 02:38:30,210
Yeah.

5133
02:38:30,890 --> 02:38:31,070
Yeah.

5134
02:38:31,990 --> 02:38:34,790
And then... How did you get all the way up there?

5135
02:38:34,830 --> 02:38:35,630
I just climb.

5136
02:38:36,790 --> 02:38:37,850
Just keep climbing.

5137
02:38:38,410 --> 02:38:38,410
Oh, wait.

5138
02:38:38,410 --> 02:38:38,410
It's a little spot here.

5139
02:38:39,050 --> 02:38:40,070
Yeah, just keep climbing.

5140
02:38:40,690 --> 02:38:40,730
Okay.

5141
02:38:41,550 --> 02:38:42,510
Oh, by the lava.

5142
02:38:42,910 --> 02:38:43,510
Oh, the lava.

5143
02:38:43,530 --> 02:38:44,450
Don't touch the lava.

5144
02:38:44,730 --> 02:38:45,530
It's a little spicy.

5145
02:38:48,210 --> 02:38:49,470
That's what the sound of mixing.

5146
02:38:56,030 --> 02:38:57,950
I don't know where to go after this.

5147
02:38:58,130 --> 02:39:00,350
I'm going to wait for Scoutmaster Lammu.

5148
02:39:00,670 --> 02:39:04,910
I think we actually want to go, like, around this way.

5149
02:39:05,530 --> 02:39:06,430
Yeah, it's not here.

5150
02:39:06,610 --> 02:39:07,710
You see this little bit here?

5151
02:39:08,990 --> 02:39:09,290
No.

5152
02:39:09,810 --> 02:39:10,150
No.

5153
02:39:11,510 --> 02:39:11,990
There.

5154
02:39:14,870 --> 02:39:16,390
Oh, that seems kind of hard.

5155
02:39:16,790 --> 02:39:18,250
How are you going to get there with lava?

5156
02:39:19,110 --> 02:39:19,930
I don't know.

5157
02:39:20,190 --> 02:39:21,270
How is it looking that way?

5158
02:39:21,430 --> 02:39:21,770
Is it okay?

5159
02:39:25,070 --> 02:39:25,690
It's good.

5160
02:39:25,870 --> 02:39:26,350
I think it's better.

5161
02:39:26,550 --> 02:39:26,790
It's better.

5162
02:39:27,090 --> 02:39:27,330
Okay.

5163
02:39:27,650 --> 02:39:27,650
Okay.

5164
02:39:28,150 --> 02:39:29,070
Let's go this way, then.

5165
02:39:30,250 --> 02:39:32,470
I think it's a little bit easier.

5166
02:39:32,730 --> 02:39:35,030
Although, how do we get up that first part there?

5167
02:39:35,510 --> 02:39:36,110
We're climbing.

5168
02:39:36,210 --> 02:39:37,010
We're climbing.

5169
02:39:37,410 --> 02:39:38,210
We're climbing.

5170
02:39:38,710 --> 02:39:41,130
There's actually a huge jump, though.

5171
02:39:41,530 --> 02:39:43,110
Oh, so was it okay?

5172
02:39:43,470 --> 02:39:43,830
Oh.

5173
02:39:44,450 --> 02:39:45,050
I'll try.

5174
02:39:46,070 --> 02:39:48,510
I feel like this one might actually be more straightforward.

5175
02:39:48,930 --> 02:39:53,090
If you can get across there, and then you go up here, and then up here...

5176
02:39:53,090 --> 02:39:54,190
I will watch you guys...

5177
02:39:54,190 --> 02:39:54,930
Uh, okay.

5178
02:39:55,610 --> 02:39:57,430
I mean, you can maybe use the tree.

5179
02:39:57,810 --> 02:39:59,450
Wait, but there's a luggage over there.

5180
02:40:00,330 --> 02:40:00,750
Yeah.

5181
02:40:01,230 --> 02:40:02,310
Oh, that's a huge fucking jump.

5182
02:40:02,310 --> 02:40:03,290
We have another rope.

5183
02:40:06,970 --> 02:40:08,410
It's not that big of a jump.

5184
02:40:08,410 --> 02:40:10,430
I miss my lollipop.

5185
02:40:11,750 --> 02:40:13,010
Gamer legs, oh.

5186
02:40:13,650 --> 02:40:15,610
What do we do, Scoutmaster?

5187
02:40:16,670 --> 02:40:17,390
Um, yum, yum, yum.

5188
02:40:18,630 --> 02:40:19,810
Um, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.

5189
02:40:27,400 --> 02:40:28,260
Who's hungry?

5190
02:40:28,760 --> 02:40:29,100
Anybody?

5191
02:40:30,060 --> 02:40:30,880
I'm all right.

5192
02:40:31,180 --> 02:40:31,420
Okay, thank you.

5193
02:40:32,580 --> 02:40:33,040
Okay.

5194
02:40:34,360 --> 02:40:34,820
Yay!

5195
02:40:36,940 --> 02:40:37,780
We go over there?

5196
02:40:38,000 --> 02:40:38,940
To the right side?

5197
02:40:39,760 --> 02:40:39,880
Wow.

5198
02:40:40,060 --> 02:40:41,300
Do people get made it, though?

5199
02:40:41,300 --> 02:40:42,020
There's no way.

5200
02:40:42,260 --> 02:40:43,320
Yeah, it's so far.

5201
02:40:45,320 --> 02:40:46,460
Where else will we go?

5202
02:40:48,020 --> 02:40:48,380
Wow.

5203
02:40:50,180 --> 02:40:51,520
Oh, my gosh, she's doing it.

5204
02:40:51,740 --> 02:40:52,500
Do your best.

5205
02:40:52,520 --> 02:40:53,120
Oh, my gosh.

5206
02:40:53,120 --> 02:40:54,300
Oh, my gosh, Scoutmaster.

5207
02:40:55,200 --> 02:40:56,060
Scoutmaster did it.

5208
02:40:56,620 --> 02:40:57,820
Scoutmaster, she's a Scoutmaster.

5209
02:40:57,820 --> 02:40:58,560
It's not too bad.

5210
02:40:58,720 --> 02:40:59,240
It's not too bad.

5211
02:40:59,400 --> 02:41:00,460
You can, like, this is straight.

5212
02:41:00,620 --> 02:41:01,440
Just jump up.

5213
02:41:03,600 --> 02:41:04,180
What, jump?

5214
02:41:04,660 --> 02:41:05,620
I got my arm up for you.

5215
02:41:05,780 --> 02:41:06,180
Jump, yeah.

5216
02:41:06,860 --> 02:41:07,060
Wow!

5217
02:41:08,600 --> 02:41:09,640
Scoutmaster did it!

5218
02:41:12,720 --> 02:41:13,940
I'm so proud of you.

5219
02:41:14,060 --> 02:41:15,920
Oh, my God, I'm gaming!

5220
02:41:16,600 --> 02:41:18,020
Ma, get the camera!

5221
02:41:20,140 --> 02:41:20,500
Yeah!

5222
02:41:21,460 --> 02:41:22,960
You stay, you stay, you stay.

5223
02:41:23,040 --> 02:41:23,760
We burn it!

5224
02:41:23,760 --> 02:41:25,020
Yeah, we're here for the storm, I think.

5225
02:41:25,180 --> 02:41:25,960
Be careful, don't touch the rock.

5226
02:41:26,080 --> 02:41:26,640
Don't touch the rock.

5227
02:41:26,760 --> 02:41:27,100
Don't touch the rock.

5228
02:41:27,100 --> 02:41:27,920
Don't touch the rock.

5229
02:41:28,380 --> 02:41:29,620
It's a dangerous rock.

5230
02:41:29,700 --> 02:41:30,480
Wait, can we climb anywhere?

5231
02:41:30,680 --> 02:41:31,160
I'm touching it.

5232
02:41:31,280 --> 02:41:31,860
I'm touching it.

5233
02:41:31,860 --> 02:41:34,380
There's some food above us as well, for those who don't have stamina.

5234
02:41:34,860 --> 02:41:36,400
Is it a safe place?

5235
02:41:37,540 --> 02:41:38,340
It's red suits.

5236
02:41:38,560 --> 02:41:38,860
It's nice.

5237
02:41:39,820 --> 02:41:40,840
I'm gonna go this way.

5238
02:41:41,560 --> 02:41:43,260
It's like a little cave in there.

5239
02:41:43,540 --> 02:41:44,700
Oh, we're going the other way.

5240
02:41:46,180 --> 02:41:48,200
Wait, now, can you stick out your hand?

5241
02:41:48,340 --> 02:41:48,940
Because I might fall.

5242
02:41:50,100 --> 02:41:51,580
JK, I'm okay.

5243
02:41:52,760 --> 02:41:53,420
You're great.

5244
02:41:53,620 --> 02:41:54,040
You're doing wonderfully.

5245
02:41:54,040 --> 02:41:55,140
I'm doing so well.

5246
02:41:56,340 --> 02:41:57,380
Here we go after that.

5247
02:41:58,920 --> 02:42:01,040
There's some food in this tree if you want any.

5248
02:42:01,780 --> 02:42:02,180
No.

5249
02:42:02,460 --> 02:42:03,440
It's too far.

5250
02:42:07,660 --> 02:42:08,880
It's too far.

5251
02:42:12,150 --> 02:42:13,470
Please climb the trees.

5252
02:42:16,010 --> 02:42:17,710
Wait, where do we go after this?

5253
02:42:17,890 --> 02:42:18,710
Anybody need any food?

5254
02:42:19,190 --> 02:42:20,050
Oh, I'm okay.

5255
02:42:20,670 --> 02:42:21,110
I'm a king.

5256
02:42:21,130 --> 02:42:22,050
I'll get an extra one.

5257
02:42:27,200 --> 02:42:28,460
Is that the right...

5258
02:42:28,460 --> 02:42:28,860
Okay.

5259
02:42:28,920 --> 02:42:31,160
I think we had some of the pitons somewhere.

5260
02:42:31,280 --> 02:42:31,340
Oh, wow.

5261
02:42:31,540 --> 02:42:31,940
Thanks a lot.

5262
02:42:31,940 --> 02:42:32,760
I can put my arm out for you.

5263
02:42:33,060 --> 02:42:33,640
You're welcome.

5264
02:42:34,900 --> 02:42:35,680
You're welcome.

5265
02:42:35,980 --> 02:42:37,200
Wait, that one was all me.

5266
02:42:37,320 --> 02:42:38,980
I'm glad I was very helpful.

5267
02:42:39,700 --> 02:42:40,640
Wait, why do I...

5268
02:42:40,640 --> 02:42:41,900
Why can't I stand?

5269
02:42:41,900 --> 02:42:43,220
I got you.

5270
02:42:44,980 --> 02:42:46,000
Oh, whoa, whoa.

5271
02:42:46,260 --> 02:42:46,900
I'm cold.

5272
02:42:46,900 --> 02:42:47,660
I'm cold.

5273
02:42:47,800 --> 02:42:48,340
I'm cold.

5274
02:42:48,540 --> 02:42:49,580
I feel so cold.

5275
02:42:50,200 --> 02:42:51,340
I feel so cold.

5276
02:42:51,580 --> 02:42:52,020
You're cool.

5277
02:42:52,160 --> 02:42:52,400
You're cool.

5278
02:42:53,120 --> 02:42:54,960
I feel cold.

5279
02:42:55,400 --> 02:42:56,360
Hey, no, you're so cool.

5280
02:42:57,160 --> 02:42:57,840
Where's Min?

5281
02:42:58,200 --> 02:42:59,900
Are we all fitting on you somehow?

5282
02:42:59,900 --> 02:43:00,540
We're here.

5283
02:43:00,600 --> 02:43:00,920
We're here.

5284
02:43:01,100 --> 02:43:01,640
We're all here.

5285
02:43:01,880 --> 02:43:02,360
Alrighty.

5286
02:43:03,220 --> 02:43:03,540
Alright.

5287
02:43:05,080 --> 02:43:06,280
Up we go.

5288
02:43:06,780 --> 02:43:07,700
Clam, clam, clam.

5289
02:43:08,500 --> 02:43:09,740
Wait, I don't even like this.

5290
02:43:10,300 --> 02:43:11,620
Yeah, I don't like this either.

5291
02:43:11,900 --> 02:43:12,240
Wait.

5292
02:43:13,660 --> 02:43:14,920
Oh, not, not yeah.

5293
02:43:15,160 --> 02:43:15,620
Not yeah.

5294
02:43:15,880 --> 02:43:16,260
Not yeah.

5295
02:43:17,380 --> 02:43:17,860
There.

5296
02:43:17,960 --> 02:43:18,440
Yes.

5297
02:43:18,800 --> 02:43:19,020
Oh, Jesus.

5298
02:43:19,620 --> 02:43:20,540
There's this bit here?

5299
02:43:20,700 --> 02:43:22,700
If we can jump across the lava behind Min.

5300
02:43:23,380 --> 02:43:23,780
Oh.

5301
02:43:24,140 --> 02:43:25,440
But it's still really far.

5302
02:43:25,820 --> 02:43:26,280
That's scary.

5303
02:43:26,900 --> 02:43:27,800
What about to our left?

5304
02:43:29,580 --> 02:43:31,180
That's like really far.

5305
02:43:32,700 --> 02:43:33,840
Anything over that way?

5306
02:43:35,880 --> 02:43:36,680
Actually, yeah.

5307
02:43:36,920 --> 02:43:39,180
I wonder if I eat, if I can make it up there.

5308
02:43:39,340 --> 02:43:39,560
Okay.

5309
02:43:40,260 --> 02:43:40,820
I'm gonna try.

5310
02:43:40,820 --> 02:43:43,000
No, you, you, I don't, I don't think so, Min.

5311
02:43:43,800 --> 02:43:44,680
Is that safe?

5312
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:46,380
Oh.

5313
02:43:46,600 --> 02:43:47,340
I made it.

5314
02:43:47,720 --> 02:43:48,600
Come this way, Min.

5315
02:43:49,340 --> 02:43:50,200
We got it.

5316
02:43:50,460 --> 02:43:51,440
This is safe.

5317
02:43:52,500 --> 02:43:53,260
I'm gonna try up here.

5318
02:43:53,460 --> 02:43:53,660
Min, be careful.

5319
02:43:54,560 --> 02:43:55,680
Min, come this way.

5320
02:43:58,580 --> 02:43:59,940
Oh, there's a safe, there's a safe.

5321
02:44:01,260 --> 02:44:01,680
Oh, no.

5322
02:44:02,020 --> 02:44:02,460
Oh, no.

5323
02:44:02,640 --> 02:44:04,440
Someone else has to, someone else has to do this.

5324
02:44:04,580 --> 02:44:05,160
Can you see my rope?

5325
02:44:05,840 --> 02:44:07,220
Do you have, what's your...

5326
02:44:07,900 --> 02:44:08,420
I'm good.

5327
02:44:08,620 --> 02:44:12,260
But if I just need an extra, just a little bit of stamina to get that.

5328
02:44:13,240 --> 02:44:13,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5329
02:44:13,820 --> 02:44:14,440
You're fine.

5330
02:44:14,620 --> 02:44:15,000
I got it.

5331
02:44:15,940 --> 02:44:16,260
Okay.

5332
02:44:16,600 --> 02:44:16,920
Stick out.

5333
02:44:17,080 --> 02:44:17,120
Oh.

5334
02:44:17,420 --> 02:44:17,700
Okay, hold on.

5335
02:44:17,780 --> 02:44:18,540
Wait, don't come up yet.

5336
02:44:18,720 --> 02:44:19,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5337
02:44:19,320 --> 02:44:19,780
I got a selfie.

5338
02:44:20,360 --> 02:44:20,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5339
02:44:21,080 --> 02:44:22,160
I'm gonna...

5340
02:44:22,160 --> 02:44:23,320
I'm so cold.

5341
02:44:24,260 --> 02:44:25,000
I'm so cold.

5342
02:44:25,100 --> 02:44:26,120
Snuffy, I'm so cold.

5343
02:44:26,320 --> 02:44:27,520
Snuffy, I'm really cold.

5344
02:44:28,460 --> 02:44:29,480
I need a lantern.

5345
02:44:30,760 --> 02:44:31,560
Come here, come here.

5346
02:44:32,360 --> 02:44:32,700
Where?

5347
02:44:33,540 --> 02:44:34,200
Where's he there?

5348
02:44:34,340 --> 02:44:34,960
Where are you?

5349
02:44:35,100 --> 02:44:35,400
Come here.

5350
02:44:35,780 --> 02:44:36,520
Oh, oh, oh.

5351
02:44:36,940 --> 02:44:37,940
I need the lantern.

5352
02:44:37,940 --> 02:44:38,800
I'm so cold.

5353
02:44:39,000 --> 02:44:39,440
Okay, I'm good.

5354
02:44:39,480 --> 02:44:39,720
I'm good.

5355
02:44:39,720 --> 02:44:39,980
I'm good.

5356
02:44:39,980 --> 02:44:40,680
I'm okay now.

5357
02:44:41,740 --> 02:44:42,380
I'm still here.

5358
02:44:42,500 --> 02:44:43,220
I'm ready to grab you.

5359
02:44:43,720 --> 02:44:44,820
Okay, give me a sec.

5360
02:44:44,940 --> 02:44:45,920
I need to get up.

5361
02:44:46,140 --> 02:44:46,840
Oh, no, my lantern.

5362
02:44:47,680 --> 02:44:47,900
Oh.

5363
02:44:49,080 --> 02:44:49,440
Okay.

5364
02:44:50,240 --> 02:44:51,200
Okay, give me a sec.

5365
02:44:51,360 --> 02:44:52,900
I need to recharge my stamina.

5366
02:44:55,900 --> 02:44:56,780
Can you get up here?

5367
02:44:56,780 --> 02:44:56,960
Okay.

5368
02:44:59,340 --> 02:44:59,780
Alright.

5369
02:44:59,780 --> 02:45:01,000
Alright, I'm coming up.

5370
02:45:02,760 --> 02:45:03,980
I'm coming up.

5371
02:45:05,440 --> 02:45:06,300
She's coming up.

5372
02:45:06,460 --> 02:45:07,100
She's coming up.

5373
02:45:07,100 --> 02:45:07,240
She's coming up.

5374
02:45:07,560 --> 02:45:07,980
She's coming up.

5375
02:45:07,980 --> 02:45:08,560
I'm here.

5376
02:45:10,080 --> 02:45:11,520
Is that... Oh, nice.

5377
02:45:11,680 --> 02:45:12,120
Lollipop.

5378
02:45:13,780 --> 02:45:14,220
Nice.

5379
02:45:14,660 --> 02:45:19,560
Snuffy, if you can climb up here, I got the... I'm gonna hide in here in case the blizzard comes.

5380
02:45:20,040 --> 02:45:20,760
Oh my god.

5381
02:45:21,880 --> 02:45:22,820
Is Min okay?

5382
02:45:23,300 --> 02:45:23,700
No.

5383
02:45:23,900 --> 02:45:24,320
Oh my god.

5384
02:45:24,360 --> 02:45:27,500
They're freaking out about something, but it's the kind of voice you'd use when you see it.

5385
02:45:27,500 --> 02:45:29,620
I see a cute animal, so I'm not sure what's going on over there.

5386
02:45:31,020 --> 02:45:31,880
Hold on, wait.

5387
02:45:32,160 --> 02:45:33,520
I gotta shelter for a second.

5388
02:45:34,360 --> 02:45:34,880
Me too.

5389
02:45:42,970 --> 02:45:44,070
Are you guys okay?

5390
02:45:48,180 --> 02:45:49,860
Are you guys okay down there?

5391
02:45:52,900 --> 02:45:54,000
Okay, we're here.

5392
02:45:54,660 --> 02:45:56,660
Try... try to come quickly, though, because we're running out of time.

5393
02:45:56,880 --> 02:45:57,880
Yeah, yeah, I'm here.

5394
02:45:59,160 --> 02:45:59,740
What's happening?

5395
02:46:00,760 --> 02:46:01,840
Grab my hand.

5396
02:46:02,240 --> 02:46:02,980
Right here, right above you.

5397
02:46:02,980 --> 02:46:03,040
Oh.

5398
02:46:04,100 --> 02:46:05,540
Grab my hand.

5399
02:46:07,660 --> 02:46:08,160
Thanks.

5400
02:46:08,680 --> 02:46:09,460
Grab my hand.

5401
02:46:09,880 --> 02:46:10,940
I almost didn't make it.

5402
02:46:10,980 --> 02:46:11,620
There you go.

5403
02:46:11,960 --> 02:46:13,580
Yeah, we're lowed.

5404
02:46:14,280 --> 02:46:15,640
We did it, guys.

5405
02:46:15,640 --> 02:46:16,860
We are in this tree up here.

5406
02:46:16,860 --> 02:46:17,760
Run, run, run, run!

5407
02:46:18,280 --> 02:46:20,720
Oh, hold on, hold on, hold on!

5408
02:46:21,140 --> 02:46:22,300
We are little penguins!

5409
02:46:22,600 --> 02:46:23,600
We are little penguins!

5410
02:46:23,840 --> 02:46:24,540
Stand here, stand here!

5411
02:46:24,720 --> 02:46:25,760
It doesn't hit here, too.

5412
02:46:25,840 --> 02:46:26,820
Yeah, it doesn't hit here, either.

5413
02:46:27,200 --> 02:46:28,020
I think we're dead, yeah.

5414
02:46:28,620 --> 02:46:29,580
Get off of us!

5415
02:46:29,680 --> 02:46:30,760
Oh my god!

5416
02:46:31,160 --> 02:46:32,840
No, you guys can crouch-boost me!

5417
02:46:34,300 --> 02:46:37,820
If you jump on each other's heads, you can boost jump.

5418
02:46:38,080 --> 02:46:38,480
What?!

5419
02:46:38,480 --> 02:46:39,240
Boost jump me!

5420
02:46:40,400 --> 02:46:40,960
Do it!

5421
02:46:41,200 --> 02:46:43,000
You can get that baton up there, maybe.

5422
02:46:43,160 --> 02:46:44,580
Go, go, go, go, go!

5423
02:46:45,220 --> 02:46:47,220
Go, go, go, go!

5424
02:46:47,420 --> 02:46:48,720
How many people can be on a baton?

5425
02:46:49,560 --> 02:46:52,580
Uh, for those- those rusty ones, I don't think you can both do it.

5426
02:46:55,460 --> 02:46:55,900
Oh.

5427
02:46:56,520 --> 02:46:56,760
No.

5428
02:46:57,560 --> 02:46:58,300
Don't try!

5429
02:46:59,640 --> 02:47:04,200
Wait, I thought your energy- I thought your- I thought your energy comes back after.

5430
02:47:05,240 --> 02:47:05,820
I thought so, too.

5431
02:47:05,840 --> 02:47:06,160
Yeah.

5432
02:47:06,660 --> 02:47:08,240
I'm not sure about those special ones.

5433
02:47:08,540 --> 02:47:08,760
Oh!

5434
02:47:10,400 --> 02:47:11,720
That was, like, so confused.

5435
02:47:12,220 --> 02:47:14,840
Don- Dur, why did you hold your hand out?!

5436
02:47:18,260 --> 02:47:20,220
That's right, that's right, that's right!

5437
02:47:23,020 --> 02:47:25,100
Well, some of us- Oh my god!

5438
02:47:25,260 --> 02:47:25,780
Look at that bug!

5439
02:47:27,560 --> 02:47:30,860
Okay, I think I can- oh god- I think I can eat- and maybe lift this up.

5440
02:47:31,880 --> 02:47:34,920
Yeah, this doesn't... Wait, this doesn't give you energy at all.

5441
02:47:35,440 --> 02:47:38,420
Like the... Oh wait, it does.

5442
02:47:38,580 --> 02:47:39,700
Wait, this is bugged up.

5443
02:47:40,080 --> 02:47:40,720
Now it did.

5444
02:47:42,120 --> 02:47:42,920
Oh, weird.

5445
02:47:43,680 --> 02:47:44,640
Wait, so you're good now?

5446
02:47:44,780 --> 02:47:45,420
Yeah, it's good.

5447
02:47:46,840 --> 02:47:47,540
Okay, I'll wait.

5448
02:47:50,000 --> 02:47:50,740
I got you.

5449
02:47:51,000 --> 02:47:51,000
I swear.

5450
02:47:51,720 --> 02:47:53,000
I'm coming the same way as Rogi!

5451
02:47:58,840 --> 02:47:59,900
Oh, it collapsed.

5452
02:47:59,960 --> 02:48:00,560
It broke.

5453
02:48:01,500 --> 02:48:03,060
Oh yeah, it does that after a while.

5454
02:48:10,120 --> 02:48:11,720
Mad cause bad.

5455
02:48:11,940 --> 02:48:13,080
Mad cause bad.

5456
02:48:30,480 --> 02:48:32,820
My hand is up here.

5457
02:48:35,920 --> 02:48:37,820
My hand is out.

5458
02:48:37,820 --> 02:48:40,700
I tried to grab you.

5459
02:48:42,200 --> 02:48:43,680
My hand is out.

5460
02:48:44,100 --> 02:48:45,780
We're so close.

5461
02:48:45,780 --> 02:48:47,160
We're so close guys.

5462
02:48:47,580 --> 02:48:48,520
My hand...

5463
02:48:48,520 --> 02:48:49,640
That's not true.

5464
02:48:49,900 --> 02:48:50,920
That's not true.

5465
02:48:51,200 --> 02:48:51,900
That's not true.

5466
02:48:52,220 --> 02:48:52,800
I was here.

5467
02:48:52,800 --> 02:48:54,060
My hand was out.

5468
02:48:54,820 --> 02:48:56,000
My hand was out.

5469
02:48:56,520 --> 02:48:57,360
Yes it is.

5470
02:48:57,520 --> 02:48:58,480
Look at my hand.

5471
02:48:58,720 --> 02:48:59,520
It's literally out.

5472
02:49:00,200 --> 02:49:02,460
So I didn't know she was doing that.

5473
02:49:02,840 --> 02:49:03,960
What did I do?

5474
02:49:04,520 --> 02:49:05,900
I didn't do anything!

5475
02:49:06,460 --> 02:49:08,600
What the fuck did I do?

5476
02:49:10,280 --> 02:49:12,600
What do you mean you didn't know I was doing?

5477
02:49:12,900 --> 02:49:14,040
What did I even do?

5478
02:49:14,140 --> 02:49:15,600
I don't even know what I even did.

5479
02:49:15,600 --> 02:49:16,700
You're doing nothing!

5480
02:49:16,900 --> 02:49:17,540
That's the issue!

5481
02:49:18,420 --> 02:49:18,780
Oh no.

5482
02:49:19,800 --> 02:49:20,080
Oh.

5483
02:49:22,280 --> 02:49:23,680
There's so much blue rock.

5484
02:49:23,820 --> 02:49:25,780
Wait, how did you were able to time that?

5485
02:49:26,480 --> 02:49:27,740
Does it freeze kill you?

5486
02:49:27,860 --> 02:49:29,140
I'm so tempted to touch it.

5487
02:49:29,280 --> 02:49:32,420
It gives you a little freeze like the snow thingy.

5488
02:49:32,480 --> 02:49:33,460
The same as the blizzard.

5489
02:49:33,720 --> 02:49:34,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5490
02:49:34,280 --> 02:49:35,340
Oh, okay, okay.

5491
02:49:36,280 --> 02:49:37,180
Wait, I don't understand.

5492
02:49:37,180 --> 02:49:38,460
I can't get on top of that.

5493
02:49:40,160 --> 02:49:42,760
I don't know.

5494
02:49:42,760 --> 02:49:45,420
How come you let her on top of it but not me?

5495
02:49:45,620 --> 02:49:46,020
This rock?

5496
02:49:46,720 --> 02:49:47,500
Right here too.

5497
02:49:50,060 --> 02:49:50,460
Wait.

5498
02:49:50,760 --> 02:49:51,160
Oh.

5499
02:49:51,720 --> 02:49:52,020
I'm on top.

5500
02:49:52,020 --> 02:49:53,340
Oh, maybe it's like just...

5501
02:49:53,340 --> 02:49:54,040
No, no, no!

5502
02:49:54,040 --> 02:49:54,580
No, no, no!

5503
02:49:54,920 --> 02:49:55,580
No, no, no!

5504
02:49:55,740 --> 02:49:56,260
Yeah, see?

5505
02:49:56,360 --> 02:49:56,880
I told you.

5506
02:49:57,980 --> 02:49:58,380
No, no!

5507
02:49:58,380 --> 02:49:59,500
I'll push you off the wheel.

5508
02:50:00,400 --> 02:50:01,520
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

5509
02:50:01,920 --> 02:50:02,280
My move!

5510
02:50:02,740 --> 02:50:03,460
There you go.

5511
02:50:03,920 --> 02:50:04,320
Ah!

5512
02:50:05,080 --> 02:50:05,980
Oh, I'm sorry!

5513
02:50:06,260 --> 02:50:07,420
You took me off with you!

5514
02:50:09,880 --> 02:50:11,140
There's a petard here!

5515
02:50:11,140 --> 02:50:12,280
Wait, I don't understand.

5516
02:50:12,660 --> 02:50:18,100
I can't seem to... I can't seem to... I can't seem to... I can't seem to... I can't get on it.

5517
02:50:18,300 --> 02:50:18,760
I don't know.

5518
02:50:18,940 --> 02:50:19,820
Skill issue.

5519
02:50:24,000 --> 02:50:24,720
There you go.

5520
02:50:25,240 --> 02:50:25,840
I'm on it.

5521
02:50:26,020 --> 02:50:26,780
I'm on it now.

5522
02:50:26,920 --> 02:50:28,580
I'm on it now.

5523
02:50:29,420 --> 02:50:30,600
I'm on it now.

5524
02:50:30,880 --> 02:50:30,900
I'm on it now.

5525
02:50:30,900 --> 02:50:31,380
I'm on it now.

5526
02:50:31,400 --> 02:50:32,240
I'm on it now.

5527
02:50:32,400 --> 02:50:32,700
Yay!

5528
02:50:36,280 --> 02:50:36,760
Teamwork!

5529
02:50:39,300 --> 02:50:39,780
Yay!

5530
02:50:40,900 --> 02:50:42,220
It makes the dream work.

5531
02:50:42,400 --> 02:50:44,020
Where do we go now, Scoutmaster?

5532
02:50:44,440 --> 02:50:45,920
I'm taking a look, hold on.

5533
02:50:46,880 --> 02:50:47,640
She's taking a look.

5534
02:50:47,920 --> 02:50:49,200
We're gonna take a look, too.

5535
02:50:49,880 --> 02:50:50,880
I'm taking a piss.

5536
02:50:52,160 --> 02:50:53,360
At this whole situation.

5537
02:50:56,940 --> 02:50:58,160
Wait, where did she go?

5538
02:50:58,740 --> 02:50:59,780
Wait, what happened?

5539
02:50:59,980 --> 02:51:00,580
I heard the...

5540
02:51:00,580 --> 02:51:01,540
Snuffy, are you okay?

5541
02:51:01,960 --> 02:51:04,000
Wait, what did she do?

5542
02:51:04,180 --> 02:51:05,440
Did you push her down?

5543
02:51:05,440 --> 02:51:06,680
What did you do?

5544
02:51:11,590 --> 02:51:13,370
I don't know what happened to her.

5545
02:51:14,030 --> 02:51:15,170
Wait, there's a campfire!

5546
02:51:15,510 --> 02:51:16,810
It's okay, if she's dead, it's okay.

5547
02:51:16,950 --> 02:51:17,850
There's a campfire!

5548
02:51:18,650 --> 02:51:20,250
She, like, ricocheted so bad.

5549
02:51:20,770 --> 02:51:21,610
What happened?

5550
02:51:21,850 --> 02:51:22,350
I'm sorry.

5551
02:51:23,170 --> 02:51:23,950
What happened?

5552
02:51:24,730 --> 02:51:25,810
What did you do?

5553
02:51:25,930 --> 02:51:27,330
What did you do, Stuffy?

5554
02:51:28,770 --> 02:51:30,470
Did you commit the murder?

5555
02:51:31,710 --> 02:51:32,770
Did you murder?

5556
02:51:33,150 --> 02:51:35,910
I think Min thinks... I'm sorry, I think Snuffy thinks you committed a murder.

5557
02:51:35,910 --> 02:51:36,990
What did I do?

5558
02:51:37,530 --> 02:51:38,330
No, no, no, no, no, no.

5559
02:51:38,330 --> 02:51:39,550
She was saying she's so dead.

5560
02:51:39,730 --> 02:51:42,190
I thought she was threatening you, but I think she was talking about Mint falling.

5561
02:51:42,550 --> 02:51:43,410
Oh, yeah, no, she's dead.

5562
02:51:43,630 --> 02:51:44,370
There she is.

5563
02:51:44,630 --> 02:51:45,770
There she is.

5564
02:51:46,810 --> 02:51:48,510
Yeah, I died.

5565
02:51:48,950 --> 02:51:50,710
How did you die?

5566
02:51:52,010 --> 02:51:52,190
How did you die?

5567
02:51:52,190 --> 02:51:53,710
Oh, no.

5568
02:51:54,530 --> 02:51:55,450
How did you die?

5569
02:51:56,710 --> 02:51:57,510
I fell.

5570
02:51:57,510 --> 02:51:57,690
Thank you.

5571
02:51:57,890 --> 02:51:59,350
I fell, and then I...

5572
02:51:59,350 --> 02:52:01,230
Wait, but how did you fall?

5573
02:52:01,870 --> 02:52:03,630
I don't think you had enough stamina.

5574
02:52:04,050 --> 02:52:05,310
Yeah, I didn't have enough stamina.

5575
02:52:06,010 --> 02:52:07,150
Alright, don't worry.

5576
02:52:07,150 --> 02:52:09,650
You should have said I had a little berry I would've given it to you.

5577
02:52:09,650 --> 02:52:10,770
Yeah, I had a lollipop.

5578
02:52:11,010 --> 02:52:13,010
I wouldn't have given it to you, but I had it.

5579
02:52:14,030 --> 02:52:15,210
Yeah, I know you... whatever.

5580
02:52:19,210 --> 02:52:19,970
I'll get there.

5581
02:52:19,970 --> 02:52:21,950
Don't worry, my arm is up here.

5582
02:52:23,470 --> 02:52:24,610
Okay, I got it.

5583
02:52:24,810 --> 02:52:25,610
There you go.

5584
02:52:26,390 --> 02:52:27,750
There you go, there you go.

5585
02:52:29,810 --> 02:52:31,610
It would've worked eventually.

5586
02:52:32,710 --> 02:52:33,790
Did we make it?

5587
02:52:36,210 --> 02:52:38,350
Oh my god, we made it!

5588
02:52:40,370 --> 02:52:41,470
We're gamers!

5589
02:52:43,170 --> 02:52:45,010
You practically are still here.

5590
02:52:45,290 --> 02:52:46,510
Did you have anything with you?

5591
02:52:46,630 --> 02:52:47,270
Yeah, so true, so true.

5592
02:52:47,770 --> 02:52:49,330
I was... I was.

5593
02:52:49,330 --> 02:52:52,750
At least we didn't have the heartbreak between using Bungle again.

5594
02:52:52,950 --> 02:52:53,890
Yeah, here it is.

5595
02:52:53,890 --> 02:52:54,790
Yeah, because we already lost him.

5596
02:52:55,550 --> 02:52:56,930
Yeah, we lost that guy.

5597
02:52:57,310 --> 02:52:59,310
Yeah, somebody dropped him.

5598
02:53:01,330 --> 02:53:02,170
I wonder who.

5599
02:53:02,410 --> 02:53:03,050
I wonder who.

5600
02:53:06,430 --> 02:53:07,150
Wait, what?

5601
02:53:07,850 --> 02:53:08,910
I don't think it was actually me!

5602
02:53:14,570 --> 02:53:15,650
We did it!

5603
02:53:15,770 --> 02:53:17,430
We lord of the flies-ed it!

5604
02:53:17,430 --> 02:53:19,490
Break me back!

5605
02:53:19,610 --> 02:53:20,190
Somebody!

5606
02:53:20,750 --> 02:53:22,530
Wait, there's only two marshmallows!

5607
02:53:22,830 --> 02:53:23,510
Thank you!

5608
02:53:26,620 --> 02:53:27,100
Oh no!

5609
02:53:27,380 --> 02:53:29,560
I instantly grabbed the item!

5610
02:53:33,500 --> 02:53:34,640
Oh my god!

5611
02:53:35,820 --> 02:53:37,420
I'll put some stuff on.

5612
02:53:40,600 --> 02:53:41,740
Are you gonna take the backpack?

5613
02:53:42,320 --> 02:53:43,640
I don't trust you...

5614
02:53:44,240 --> 02:53:46,020
Put stuff in my backpack.

5615
02:53:47,680 --> 02:53:48,640
Yeah, well...

5616
02:53:48,640 --> 02:53:50,600
Did you take my marshmallow too, huh?

5617
02:53:50,620 --> 02:53:52,240
There was only two marshmallows.

5618
02:53:53,200 --> 02:53:53,500
What?

5619
02:53:53,680 --> 02:53:53,800
Why?

5620
02:53:54,060 --> 02:53:54,740
Not even for me?

5621
02:53:54,860 --> 02:53:55,080
Yeah.

5622
02:53:55,080 --> 02:53:55,860
I don't know why.

5623
02:53:56,020 --> 02:53:56,940
Yeah, there's only two.

5624
02:53:57,940 --> 02:53:58,960
Snuffy, do you need food?

5625
02:53:59,820 --> 02:54:02,000
I need orange bear, I suppose.

5626
02:54:02,540 --> 02:54:03,200
Are you sure?

5627
02:54:03,400 --> 02:54:04,080
Cause I'm fine.

5628
02:54:04,080 --> 02:54:04,720
I have- I have snacks.

5629
02:54:05,060 --> 02:54:05,460
Wait, Snuffy.

5630
02:54:05,540 --> 02:54:06,180
Look in my backpack.

5631
02:54:06,420 --> 02:54:07,040
I have snacks in there.

5632
02:54:09,380 --> 02:54:09,960
Snack pack.

5633
02:54:10,220 --> 02:54:11,320
I only had one snack.

5634
02:54:12,860 --> 02:54:13,580
That's right.

5635
02:54:13,940 --> 02:54:14,940
There was only one.

5636
02:54:15,260 --> 02:54:16,680
Okay, so this one is actually fully horizontal.

5637
02:54:16,840 --> 02:54:18,080
You see where the smoke is?

5638
02:54:18,260 --> 02:54:18,280
Yeah.

5639
02:54:18,280 --> 02:54:19,580
We gotta just navigate the lava.

5640
02:54:19,800 --> 02:54:20,320
Oh yeah.

5641
02:54:22,460 --> 02:54:23,100
Snack break.

5642
02:54:23,420 --> 02:54:25,020
Snack- At least there's no blizzard now.

5643
02:54:25,200 --> 02:54:25,940
It's just lava.

5644
02:54:25,940 --> 02:54:26,660
Yeah.

5645
02:54:26,660 --> 02:54:29,060
Wait, but I can see the- the fire.

5646
02:54:29,200 --> 02:54:30,140
Yeah, it's horizontal.

5647
02:54:30,680 --> 02:54:32,400
Yeah, it's- Oh, it's parkour!

5648
02:54:32,560 --> 02:54:33,640
It's literally parkour!

5649
02:54:33,760 --> 02:54:35,340
It's American Ninja Warrior.

5650
02:54:35,740 --> 02:54:36,180
Yeah, yeah.

5651
02:54:36,180 --> 02:54:39,200
Yeah, it's- Uh, I think we go left.

5652
02:54:39,540 --> 02:54:39,880
Okay.

5653
02:54:41,240 --> 02:54:41,640
Maybe?

5654
02:54:41,980 --> 02:54:43,400
Well, actually, that one's kinda far.

5655
02:54:43,680 --> 02:54:44,180
I don't know.

5656
02:54:44,540 --> 02:54:46,060
No, we kinda have to go this way, I think.

5657
02:54:46,420 --> 02:54:47,000
This way?

5658
02:54:47,220 --> 02:54:47,720
Yeah, okay.

5659
02:54:47,840 --> 02:54:48,100
I'm already committed.

5660
02:54:48,500 --> 02:54:50,180
Like this way, and then across here.

5661
02:54:50,300 --> 02:54:50,540
Okay.

5662
02:54:51,400 --> 02:54:54,160
Cause I don't think- I mean, unless we take a little bit of toasty damage there.

5663
02:54:54,160 --> 02:54:56,040
What would you guys like to do?

5664
02:54:56,260 --> 02:54:58,420
I will listen to Scoutmaster Lamu.

5665
02:54:59,200 --> 02:54:59,720
Okay.

5666
02:55:00,460 --> 02:55:00,760
Okay.

5667
02:55:01,840 --> 02:55:02,820
I'm down.

5668
02:55:03,340 --> 02:55:04,420
I listened.

5669
02:55:04,860 --> 02:55:05,680
He's already gone.

5670
02:55:05,880 --> 02:55:06,080
Alright.

5671
02:55:07,380 --> 02:55:08,740
I'm going in.

5672
02:55:09,040 --> 02:55:09,460
Oh shoot!

5673
02:55:09,800 --> 02:55:09,920
Ouch!

5674
02:55:10,400 --> 02:55:10,680
Ouch!

5675
02:55:11,300 --> 02:55:12,140
I'm in!

5676
02:55:13,540 --> 02:55:15,120
Don't forget- Oh my gosh, Mint!

5677
02:55:15,320 --> 02:55:15,820
Don't forget!

5678
02:55:16,080 --> 02:55:18,480
If you turn around- Whoa!

5679
02:55:19,120 --> 02:55:19,540
Whoa!

5680
02:55:19,720 --> 02:55:22,160
This is scary, Scoutmaster!

5681
02:55:22,740 --> 02:55:24,340
This is very scary!

5682
02:55:24,800 --> 02:55:25,900
You hurt so bad!

5683
02:55:27,400 --> 02:55:29,360
Oh my god, what is this pillar of flame?

5684
02:55:29,680 --> 02:55:30,800
Yeah, I don't like that.

5685
02:55:31,420 --> 02:55:31,500
These are scary.

5686
02:55:33,420 --> 02:55:35,880
I guess I think there's no food in this area.

5687
02:55:36,280 --> 02:55:38,840
Uh, there are like bird eggs around.

5688
02:55:39,020 --> 02:55:39,660
Oh, okay, okay.

5689
02:55:40,260 --> 02:55:40,900
Oh, nice.

5690
02:55:41,200 --> 02:55:42,240
Yeah, fuck those birds.

5691
02:55:42,600 --> 02:55:44,280
Um, I'm gonna- Um, I don't know.

5692
02:55:44,680 --> 02:55:47,580
You will sometimes take fire damage, but it like- It cools off.

5693
02:55:50,080 --> 02:55:51,680
Is that the right way to go?

5694
02:55:54,000 --> 02:55:54,540
Yes?

5695
02:55:54,540 --> 02:55:54,700
Yes?

5696
02:55:55,340 --> 02:55:55,420
Yes?

5697
02:55:55,420 --> 02:55:55,440
Yes?

5698
02:55:56,740 --> 02:55:57,080
Yes?

5699
02:55:57,340 --> 02:55:57,880
Yes?

5700
02:56:00,000 --> 02:56:00,540
Yes?

5701
02:56:02,780 --> 02:56:03,320
Weee!

5702
02:56:04,720 --> 02:56:08,100
Because you're not clad- It's just parkour!

5703
02:56:09,180 --> 02:56:09,720
Parkour!

5704
02:56:09,720 --> 02:56:10,740
I don't have stamina!

5705
02:56:11,540 --> 02:56:11,840
Ow!

5706
02:56:12,000 --> 02:56:12,360
Thank you!

5707
02:56:12,440 --> 02:56:13,600
It's okay, we'll grip you!

5708
02:56:13,820 --> 02:56:15,000
We'll grip you firmly!

5709
02:56:15,600 --> 02:56:16,560
Please carry me!

5710
02:56:16,900 --> 02:56:17,760
Princess, carry me!

5711
02:56:17,940 --> 02:56:18,400
The whole way!

5712
02:56:18,400 --> 02:56:18,680
Please?

5713
02:56:19,220 --> 02:56:19,700
Alright.

5714
02:56:20,540 --> 02:56:21,580
What do we do here?

5715
02:56:22,400 --> 02:56:25,260
Wait, I didn't see what has... the chain?

5716
02:56:26,300 --> 02:56:27,560
Yeah, you can climb the chain.

5717
02:56:27,640 --> 02:56:28,040
Just be careful.

5718
02:56:28,180 --> 02:56:29,640
If it's a little, you might take fire damage.

5719
02:56:30,480 --> 02:56:31,680
Fire damage is okay.

5720
02:56:32,000 --> 02:56:32,560
It'll work off.

5721
02:56:35,520 --> 02:56:36,000
Oh.

5722
02:56:36,000 --> 02:56:36,100
Oh.

5723
02:56:36,880 --> 02:56:37,360
Oh.

5724
02:56:38,160 --> 02:56:38,640
Oh.

5725
02:56:39,740 --> 02:56:40,060
Oh.

5726
02:56:40,680 --> 02:56:41,160
Ouch.

5727
02:56:41,460 --> 02:56:42,860
My little feetsies.

5728
02:56:42,860 --> 02:56:44,100
Oh.

5729
02:56:53,310 --> 02:56:54,930
My little feetsies.

5730
02:56:55,150 --> 02:56:56,770
It hurts so much.

5731
02:56:58,550 --> 02:57:00,870
Oh my little feetsies.

5732
02:57:03,850 --> 02:57:05,970
Oh no, she's burning alive.

5733
02:57:06,530 --> 02:57:07,610
She's burning alive.

5734
02:57:08,450 --> 02:57:09,470
Oh my god.

5735
02:57:09,670 --> 02:57:11,090
You haven't met yet.

5736
02:57:15,110 --> 02:57:18,830
I think Snuffy just kind of tossed her backpack into the lava.

5737
02:57:19,070 --> 02:57:19,590
But that's okay.

5738
02:57:19,590 --> 02:57:21,130
What happened to her backpack?

5739
02:57:21,510 --> 02:57:23,290
What happened to her backpack?

5740
02:57:27,630 --> 02:57:29,010
The backpack's gone.

5741
02:57:29,930 --> 02:57:30,410
Yeah.

5742
02:57:31,610 --> 02:57:33,270
I got everything from my backpack.

5743
02:57:33,710 --> 02:57:34,010
Oh, no.

5744
02:57:34,150 --> 02:57:34,710
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5745
02:57:34,870 --> 02:57:35,370
It's this way.

5746
02:57:35,390 --> 02:57:36,030
It's this way, Snuffy.

5747
02:57:36,370 --> 02:57:36,850
This way.

5748
02:57:37,130 --> 02:57:37,610
Snuffy.

5749
02:57:37,950 --> 02:57:38,950
Snuffy, turn around.

5750
02:57:39,830 --> 02:57:40,310
Snuffy.

5751
02:57:40,710 --> 02:57:41,730
Snuffy, Min's on.

5752
02:57:42,230 --> 02:57:43,250
Wait, Min, you're okay.

5753
02:57:44,250 --> 02:57:44,630
Yay.

5754
02:57:45,150 --> 02:57:46,510
Yeah, she just burned to death and then recovered.

5755
02:57:46,770 --> 02:57:47,090
Does anyone have food?

5756
02:57:47,310 --> 02:57:48,610
Because I'm not gonna make it.

5757
02:57:48,690 --> 02:57:49,050
I don't have food.

5758
02:57:49,050 --> 02:57:49,710
Yeah, I do.

5759
02:57:49,950 --> 02:57:50,570
You need to get over here now.

5760
02:57:50,570 --> 02:57:51,350
I have food too.

5761
02:57:51,510 --> 02:57:53,870
Look at my nice warm toasty marshmallows.

5762
02:57:54,950 --> 02:57:55,970
Wait, I'm letting the

5763
02:58:01,850 --> 02:58:02,690
fire...

5764
02:58:02,690 --> 02:58:03,970
You can go first.

5765
02:58:04,950 --> 02:58:06,290
Oh, the lava's coming up.

5766
02:58:06,410 --> 02:58:07,590
This is gonna make me touch lava.

5767
02:58:07,950 --> 02:58:08,610
That is killing me.

5768
02:58:10,630 --> 02:58:14,370
Oh, my God.

5769
02:58:14,650 --> 02:58:17,230
I have the high ground now, Anakin.

5770
02:58:18,350 --> 02:58:19,190
Oh, baby.

5771
02:58:20,350 --> 02:58:20,690
Ouch.

5772
02:58:21,130 --> 02:58:21,610
Ouch.

5773
02:58:22,150 --> 02:58:22,250
Ouch.

5774
02:58:22,430 --> 02:58:26,870
Why did you... No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

5775
02:58:35,710 --> 02:58:46,410
no, no, no.

5776
02:58:46,410 --> 02:58:48,310
Oh, my God.

5777
02:58:51,390 --> 02:58:54,190
Why did she do the same thing?

5778
02:58:54,970 --> 02:58:55,910
I didn't know.

5779
02:58:59,090 --> 02:59:00,430
Oh, no.

5780
02:59:01,070 --> 02:59:02,810
Oh, my God.

5781
02:59:03,190 --> 02:59:05,130
You could have waited.

5782
02:59:05,130 --> 02:59:09,590
Oh, that was a rough one.

5783
02:59:09,650 --> 02:59:10,330
My honor.

5784
02:59:10,650 --> 02:59:13,270
I'm defending my honor waiting for what?

5785
02:59:13,650 --> 02:59:14,950
I was literally on down here.

5786
02:59:14,950 --> 02:59:18,210
You could have waited for the lava to cool down.

5787
02:59:18,210 --> 02:59:20,570
There was a gonna cool.

5788
02:59:21,110 --> 02:59:22,710
Yes, it was.

5789
02:59:22,710 --> 02:59:24,550
It was cool.

5790
02:59:24,690 --> 02:59:24,690
It was cool.

5791
02:59:24,690 --> 02:59:25,550
It's like high tide.

5792
02:59:27,710 --> 02:59:29,210
Oh, I didn't know that.

5793
02:59:29,370 --> 02:59:30,370
What do you mean?

5794
02:59:31,090 --> 02:59:31,970
What do you mean?

5795
02:59:33,370 --> 02:59:35,030
I've been dead this whole time.

5796
02:59:35,210 --> 02:59:36,110
Why would I know?

5797
02:59:37,330 --> 02:59:39,170
I didn't actually know that either.

5798
02:59:39,230 --> 02:59:41,750
I didn't know it goes up and down.

5799
02:59:42,590 --> 02:59:43,230
I saw it.

5800
02:59:43,250 --> 02:59:44,230
I saw it.

5801
02:59:45,190 --> 02:59:46,410
I saw it.

5802
02:59:46,410 --> 02:59:48,730
Let the lava go up and go down.

5803
02:59:48,770 --> 02:59:50,670
Well, how were we supposed to see it?

5804
02:59:50,790 --> 02:59:53,790
Use your eyes and the eyes tell you.

5805
02:59:55,970 --> 02:59:57,230
We'll have to wait for this one.

5806
02:59:57,330 --> 02:59:58,250
I think it's about to catch fire.

5807
02:59:58,470 --> 02:59:59,970
I'm rooting for your death, Donkey Kong.

5808
03:00:01,430 --> 03:00:04,210
Yeah, you wish you had this lollipop.

5809
03:00:04,450 --> 03:00:06,070
Oh, lollipop.

5810
03:00:06,730 --> 03:00:09,270
Look at this lollipop.

5811
03:00:10,910 --> 03:00:14,630
Mint was literally begging for anybody to feed her so she could make it.

5812
03:00:14,630 --> 03:00:22,450
No, I was like I was like if you make it here I can give you this lollipop this marshmallow I said that I didn't say that shit.

5813
03:00:22,470 --> 03:00:23,610
Yes I did it.

5814
03:00:23,610 --> 03:00:27,950
I was like I have this marshmallow that I can give you if you make it.

5815
03:00:28,090 --> 03:00:28,890
All the marshmallow that you stole?

5816
03:00:29,150 --> 03:00:29,570
because..

5817
03:00:29,570 --> 03:00:30,630
What do you mean I stole?

5818
03:00:30,790 --> 03:00:32,670
I got there before you!

5819
03:00:33,770 --> 03:00:34,730
I was dead!

5820
03:00:35,210 --> 03:00:37,530
Too bad, maybe you shouldn't have died.

5821
03:00:37,930 --> 03:00:39,670
Maybe you shouldn't have died.

5822
03:00:39,930 --> 03:00:40,750
No, yeah.

5823
03:00:40,850 --> 03:00:41,530
I'm gonna kill you again.

5824
03:00:42,430 --> 03:00:43,410
I'm gonna kill you.

5825
03:00:43,450 --> 03:00:45,070
Why are you going?

5826
03:00:45,210 --> 03:00:45,710
Why are you going, baby?

5827
03:00:45,710 --> 03:00:50,190
Cause the sticky catches on fire, so I'm making sure it doesn't.

5828
03:00:50,370 --> 03:00:53,610
Look how fast Limeo is gonna get pushed off the mountain.

5829
03:00:53,650 --> 03:00:54,830
Well, that's her fault.

5830
03:00:54,930 --> 03:00:56,190
If she gets pushed up.

5831
03:00:56,550 --> 03:00:57,730
No, she is, because you're so slow.

5832
03:00:58,090 --> 03:00:58,950
No, I'm waiting for it.

5833
03:00:59,010 --> 03:00:59,310
Look, look.

5834
03:00:59,430 --> 03:01:00,150
It's gonna catch off.

5835
03:01:00,230 --> 03:01:00,830
Oh my gosh.

5836
03:01:01,010 --> 03:01:02,890
Oh my god, that's gonna catch on fire.

5837
03:01:03,610 --> 03:01:05,510
That's because you took too long.

5838
03:01:05,750 --> 03:01:07,090
And the god is angry.

5839
03:01:07,470 --> 03:01:08,230
No, it's fine.

5840
03:01:08,730 --> 03:01:09,030
It's fine.

5841
03:01:09,290 --> 03:01:10,730
Yes, it is.

5842
03:01:10,890 --> 03:01:11,510
It's fine.

5843
03:01:11,810 --> 03:01:14,290
I'm gonna wait until this catches on fire and then I'll go.

5844
03:01:14,410 --> 03:01:15,190
I don't think it will.

5845
03:01:15,450 --> 03:01:16,210
Yes, it will.

5846
03:01:16,450 --> 03:01:17,110
Yes, it will.

5847
03:01:17,850 --> 03:01:18,550
Oh, wow.

5848
03:01:18,790 --> 03:01:19,450
That's really fun.

5849
03:01:20,130 --> 03:01:20,310
Yeah.

5850
03:01:23,030 --> 03:01:24,670
You were the chosen one.

5851
03:01:24,770 --> 03:01:25,630
You were my brother.

5852
03:01:28,990 --> 03:01:30,290
I trusted you.

5853
03:01:30,710 --> 03:01:32,330
Wait, how did she do this, actually?

5854
03:01:32,330 --> 03:01:33,730
I was not paying attention.

5855
03:01:37,530 --> 03:01:39,150
Okay, stop being on fire.

5856
03:01:40,990 --> 03:01:41,130
Okay.

5857
03:01:42,570 --> 03:01:43,990
I actually was not paying attention.

5858
03:01:44,390 --> 03:01:45,110
Oh my god.

5859
03:01:45,190 --> 03:01:45,790
Shut the fuck up.

5860
03:01:45,870 --> 03:01:46,710
Shut the fuck up.

5861
03:01:46,870 --> 03:01:47,890
Shut the fuck up.

5862
03:01:52,050 --> 03:02:00,690
I can report you for inciting deaf violence towards me.

5863
03:02:00,910 --> 03:02:01,490
I don't care.

5864
03:02:01,590 --> 03:02:02,270
I'm gonna tell them.

5865
03:02:02,330 --> 03:02:04,110
that you told me to the scoutmaster.

5866
03:02:04,290 --> 03:02:09,910
I'm gonna report you to the scoutmaster for, um, doing deaf friends towards me.

5867
03:02:10,150 --> 03:02:10,730
Holy shit.

5868
03:02:12,030 --> 03:02:13,550
Are you guys good?

5869
03:02:15,230 --> 03:02:20,430
And I have some fucking demon here yelling, die, die, die, in my ear.

5870
03:02:20,430 --> 03:02:22,950
I don't care if that's what she was shouting.

5871
03:02:27,310 --> 03:02:31,750
Even though her step wasn't even my fault.

5872
03:02:32,130 --> 03:02:34,250
She is blaming me.

5873
03:02:34,710 --> 03:02:34,790
I'm starving.

5874
03:02:35,410 --> 03:02:37,450
I needed energy and I had that.

5875
03:02:39,230 --> 03:02:43,550
I literally said, hey, if you make it through, if you make it, I can give you my marshmallows.

5876
03:02:43,570 --> 03:02:44,650
That's what I said.

5877
03:02:45,730 --> 03:02:47,050
That's what I said.

5878
03:02:47,410 --> 03:02:48,190
I did not know.

5879
03:02:48,370 --> 03:02:49,250
I didn't know.

5880
03:02:49,250 --> 03:02:50,950
I didn't know you'd eat it before.

5881
03:02:55,090 --> 03:02:55,970
Information was...

5882
03:02:55,970 --> 03:02:59,390
You have to give her the lollipop.

5883
03:03:02,530 --> 03:03:05,230
She would rather die than give her the lollipop.

5884
03:03:17,080 --> 03:03:18,220
Nobody gets it.

5885
03:03:18,220 --> 03:03:20,020
You should have just waited until it receded.

5886
03:03:20,660 --> 03:03:21,980
How did you wait?

5887
03:03:22,160 --> 03:03:23,300
The lollipop went down.

5888
03:03:23,380 --> 03:03:24,180
No, I didn't let it.

5889
03:03:24,580 --> 03:03:25,600
The lollipop went down.

5890
03:03:25,900 --> 03:03:27,140
Oh my gosh.

5891
03:03:27,860 --> 03:03:30,060
I don't know.

5892
03:03:30,600 --> 03:03:35,140
I don't know.

5893
03:03:35,260 --> 03:03:38,940
Maybe because like someone kept yelling, die, die, die, die.

5894
03:03:39,380 --> 03:03:43,000
That I wasn't paying attention to the lava.

5895
03:03:43,300 --> 03:03:44,080
That was clearly...

5896
03:03:44,080 --> 03:03:46,840
You shouldn't... What do you mean?

5897
03:03:47,100 --> 03:03:50,360
You're supposed to use your eyes and wait for it to go back down.

5898
03:03:50,700 --> 03:03:52,540
Oh yeah, yeah, let the guy...

5899
03:03:52,540 --> 03:03:52,760
You didn't know?

5900
03:03:54,360 --> 03:03:58,040
Die, die, die, die, die, die, die.

5901
03:03:58,780 --> 03:04:00,500
It worked, it worked.

5902
03:04:03,480 --> 03:04:06,680
You manifested the downtime of the first scout number.

5903
03:04:06,800 --> 03:04:07,620
I hope you get a badge.

5904
03:04:09,480 --> 03:04:12,780
I'm pretty sure... Is that gonna actually like catch on fire?

5905
03:04:13,020 --> 03:04:13,320
I don't know.

5906
03:04:13,340 --> 03:04:14,480
I don't know, I can't tell.

5907
03:04:14,480 --> 03:04:16,140
I think it's just because it's high right now.

5908
03:04:16,300 --> 03:04:16,560
Yeah.

5909
03:04:18,240 --> 03:04:18,540
Nice.

5910
03:04:18,540 --> 03:04:19,520
You can just climb up.

5911
03:04:20,860 --> 03:04:21,960
Climb, climb, climb.

5912
03:04:21,960 --> 03:04:25,380
Oh, now you're not gonna say die, die, die.

5913
03:04:25,580 --> 03:04:25,740
Die, die, die.

5914
03:04:26,340 --> 03:04:26,800
Yay!

5915
03:04:31,120 --> 03:04:32,920
It's called being a team player.

5916
03:04:33,120 --> 03:04:36,320
Oh yeah, you're the best team player out there.

5917
03:04:36,740 --> 03:04:38,220
That's for sure.

5918
03:04:41,280 --> 03:04:45,320
Lily, you are definitely not rooting for anybody's demise there.

5919
03:04:46,040 --> 03:04:46,300
No!

5920
03:04:46,300 --> 03:04:46,640
Wow!

5921
03:04:47,340 --> 03:04:49,240
I'm rooting for Limu all the way!

5922
03:04:49,780 --> 03:04:50,260
Yay!

5923
03:04:51,220 --> 03:04:51,560
Yay!

5924
03:04:52,400 --> 03:04:54,620
Oh look, there's only three marshmallows.

5925
03:04:54,900 --> 03:04:55,900
No, there's four!

5926
03:04:56,280 --> 03:04:58,100
There, I can see them with my eyes!

5927
03:04:59,300 --> 03:05:00,140
Die, die.

5928
03:05:00,260 --> 03:05:02,120
Die, die, die, die.

5929
03:05:02,120 --> 03:05:04,680
Die, die, die, die.

5930
03:05:05,260 --> 03:05:05,640
Thanks!

5931
03:05:09,180 --> 03:05:10,140
Oh yeah!

5932
03:05:10,580 --> 03:05:12,860
Take all the loot before Doki eats it all!

5933
03:05:13,080 --> 03:05:14,680
Look at that, look what I got, guys!

5934
03:05:16,680 --> 03:05:18,800
Oh my god, you got it back!

5935
03:05:20,220 --> 03:05:21,180
Never punish!

5936
03:05:22,260 --> 03:05:23,220
Never punish!

5937
03:05:23,540 --> 03:05:25,720
I got my lollipop back!

5938
03:05:26,540 --> 03:05:27,960
Oh, I want this instead.

5939
03:05:29,940 --> 03:05:31,700
Wait, no lollipop.

5940
03:05:31,860 --> 03:05:33,720
No lollipop for you.

5941
03:05:35,100 --> 03:05:37,320
Look, the lollipop got res too, guys!

5942
03:05:39,160 --> 03:05:40,240
Oh wait, I can just do this.

5943
03:05:40,460 --> 03:05:41,620
Did we have any climbing items?

5944
03:05:41,980 --> 03:05:42,120
Nope.

5945
03:05:42,120 --> 03:05:43,160
Does anyone have a sports drink?

5946
03:05:43,540 --> 03:05:43,920
Nope.

5947
03:05:43,920 --> 03:05:44,220
No.

5948
03:05:44,820 --> 03:05:46,240
Oh, I don't have sports drink.

5949
03:05:46,380 --> 03:05:47,980
I have food and lollipop.

5950
03:05:48,200 --> 03:05:49,020
That's all I have.

5951
03:05:49,680 --> 03:05:50,360
Oh, just kidding.

5952
03:05:51,960 --> 03:05:52,820
That's, that's kind of what it was.

5953
03:05:52,900 --> 03:05:54,240
Sorry, I meant, I meant an energy drink.

5954
03:05:54,320 --> 03:05:54,680
That's my bad.

5955
03:05:54,680 --> 03:05:55,480
I'm ready.

5956
03:05:55,840 --> 03:05:56,900
Let's, I'm ready.

5957
03:05:57,040 --> 03:05:58,120
I'm ready to go.

5958
03:05:59,260 --> 03:06:00,220
I'm ready.

5959
03:06:00,840 --> 03:06:01,780
I'm ready.

5960
03:06:02,060 --> 03:06:02,780
I'm ready.

5961
03:06:03,440 --> 03:06:04,440
I'm ready.

5962
03:06:04,620 --> 03:06:04,660
I'm ready.

5963
03:06:04,660 --> 03:06:05,200
Let's go.

5964
03:06:05,360 --> 03:06:07,720
Let's go into the hall where there's the gold.

5965
03:06:08,000 --> 03:06:08,500
Dubs of hell!

5966
03:06:08,980 --> 03:06:09,300
Yeah!

5967
03:06:09,300 --> 03:06:10,000
Yay!

5968
03:06:11,180 --> 03:06:11,200
Yay!

5969
03:06:11,200 --> 03:06:14,120
I hope Scoutmaster is smiling down upon us.

5970
03:06:14,600 --> 03:06:15,520
I hope so too.

5971
03:06:15,760 --> 03:06:17,960
Scoutmaster's gonna be so proud of us.

5972
03:06:19,760 --> 03:06:20,640
Doot doot!

5973
03:06:20,800 --> 03:06:21,600
Doot doot!

5974
03:06:22,720 --> 03:06:23,280
Doot doot!

5975
03:06:23,280 --> 03:06:23,760
Doot doot!

5976
03:06:25,420 --> 03:06:27,200
I'm already proud of myself.

5977
03:06:27,660 --> 03:06:28,040
Hey!

5978
03:06:28,840 --> 03:06:29,460
Let's go.

5979
03:06:30,280 --> 03:06:32,000
The hall is the gold!

5980
03:06:32,000 --> 03:06:32,420
Yeah!

5981
03:06:32,420 --> 03:06:33,680
It's like laggy as hell.

5982
03:06:34,040 --> 03:06:34,600
Yeah.

5983
03:06:34,920 --> 03:06:36,520
The hall is the gold!

5984
03:06:38,580 --> 03:06:39,140
What?

5985
03:06:40,140 --> 03:06:40,700
Yeah!

5986
03:06:41,680 --> 03:06:42,020
Yeah!

5987
03:06:43,060 --> 03:06:45,820
We have to pay the troll toll to get inside the boys hole!

5988
03:06:45,820 --> 03:06:46,680
Into the boys hole!

5989
03:06:48,460 --> 03:06:48,780
What?

5990
03:06:49,580 --> 03:06:52,740
I don't think anybody has ever said that to me, but you just said it in tandem.

5991
03:06:54,200 --> 03:06:54,760
What?

5992
03:06:54,820 --> 03:06:57,060
You never heard of the critically acclaimed musical?

5993
03:06:57,060 --> 03:06:57,080
What was it just been cold?

5994
03:06:59,620 --> 03:07:01,040
Take neRail.

5995
03:07:01,040 --> 03:07:03,580
I don't know the only thing.

5996
03:07:03,580 --> 03:07:03,760
I don't know the only thing about our park.

5997
03:07:04,640 --> 03:07:10,660
Is emotions biting and wegiment?

5998
03:07:15,000 --> 03:07:21,970
AAAAAAA Fight champion of the sun!

5999
03:07:23,890 --> 03:07:27,570
He is the protector of friendship and everyone.

6000
03:07:38,010 --> 03:07:40,770
Oh my god, I can imagine it.

6001
03:07:40,950 --> 03:07:43,470
I can imagine it.

6002
03:07:44,270 --> 03:07:48,770
Yeah, maybe like, I won't have a fucking little demon on my left ear yelling, die.

6003
03:07:48,770 --> 03:07:50,850
I'll be good, I'll be good.

6004
03:07:50,910 --> 03:07:52,570
I'll be a good boy, I swear.

6005
03:07:53,130 --> 03:07:53,970
I swear.

6006
03:07:54,390 --> 03:07:55,490
The killin?

6007
03:07:56,110 --> 03:07:56,910
The killin.

6008
03:07:57,150 --> 03:07:58,110
You mean, killin?

6009
03:07:59,670 --> 03:08:01,450
Did he say that again?

6010
03:08:01,770 --> 03:08:02,850
What does that say?

6011
03:08:03,050 --> 03:08:04,570
I thought it was like, I'm killin' you.

6012
03:08:06,450 --> 03:08:07,690
The killin.

6013
03:08:08,190 --> 03:08:09,830
I don't know how it really depends.

6014
03:08:10,110 --> 03:08:10,670
The killin.

6015
03:08:11,710 --> 03:08:14,430
I feel like the left looks kinda good.

6016
03:08:14,850 --> 03:08:16,930
What's the gimmick here?

6017
03:08:17,130 --> 03:08:18,590
Is it all to catch on fire?

6018
03:08:18,590 --> 03:08:20,290
There's rocks that hurt you.

6019
03:08:20,290 --> 03:08:21,030
Uh, no, it's just hard.

6020
03:08:21,330 --> 03:08:26,790
Like, the pathway that it gives you is hard, and sometimes, it's like, you can't really do it very well without items.

6021
03:08:27,870 --> 03:08:28,250
Okay.

6022
03:08:28,510 --> 03:08:31,150
Yeah, you can run out of items to climb this.

6023
03:08:32,510 --> 03:08:37,590
Yeah, so it's kinda like, more of a, did you do well the rest of the game check, which, uh...

6024
03:08:40,700 --> 03:08:41,140
Oh!

6025
03:08:41,500 --> 03:08:43,460
Oh, that scared me!

6026
03:08:43,860 --> 03:08:46,560
Oh ho ho ho ho ho ho!

6027
03:08:47,040 --> 03:08:49,320
If I die, the lollipop dies with me.

6028
03:08:50,060 --> 03:08:52,060
Wait, where did, where did Naimu go?

6029
03:08:52,560 --> 03:08:53,880
Yeah, where did Naimu go?

6030
03:08:54,700 --> 03:08:55,980
I don't know where she went.

6031
03:08:56,280 --> 03:08:57,920
I don't know what her pathway is.

6032
03:08:59,300 --> 03:09:00,180
Thank you!

6033
03:09:00,920 --> 03:09:01,060
Yep!

6034
03:09:03,510 --> 03:09:03,810
Okay.

6035
03:09:05,250 --> 03:09:08,800
Get up there.

6036
03:09:08,940 --> 03:09:09,600
I don't know.

6037
03:09:11,880 --> 03:09:12,320
Hahaha!

6038
03:09:12,320 --> 03:09:14,700
I'm just, I'm just going by vibes.

6039
03:09:15,380 --> 03:09:16,260
Oh, keep going.

6040
03:09:17,240 --> 03:09:20,800
Wait, Naimu, I think you might have to stop, because they're, they're pretty far down.

6041
03:09:20,800 --> 03:09:22,340
Oh, oh, okay.

6042
03:09:25,130 --> 03:09:26,330
Oh, okay.

6043
03:09:26,630 --> 03:09:27,550
Here, I'm here.

6044
03:09:28,890 --> 03:09:29,490
Nice?

6045
03:09:31,350 --> 03:09:31,710
Alright.

6046
03:09:32,210 --> 03:09:32,730
Thank you.

6047
03:09:33,470 --> 03:09:34,350
You're welcome.

6048
03:09:36,890 --> 03:09:38,210
Where do we go now?

6049
03:09:38,690 --> 03:09:39,950
I think up here, maybe?

6050
03:09:40,290 --> 03:09:40,790
This way?

6051
03:09:41,270 --> 03:09:41,570
Okay.

6052
03:09:43,150 --> 03:09:45,930
We're going up, up, up, up, baby.

6053
03:09:46,370 --> 03:09:47,910
I'm gonna rest here a little.

6054
03:09:47,910 --> 03:09:50,730
It looks like it gets opening moves that we won't be able to cross.

6055
03:09:51,510 --> 03:09:51,910
Alright.

6056
03:09:52,530 --> 03:09:52,630
Yeah.

6057
03:09:53,770 --> 03:09:54,230
I'm here.

6058
03:09:55,390 --> 03:09:57,570
If you've seen a good pathway, let me know, Snuffy.

6059
03:09:57,810 --> 03:09:58,450
Cause you looked.

6060
03:09:59,230 --> 03:09:59,530
Yeah.

6061
03:09:59,530 --> 03:10:00,930
I don't even know a pathway.

6062
03:10:00,990 --> 03:10:01,690
I think it's mostly the left.

6063
03:10:03,070 --> 03:10:04,190
It has a lot of good laying.

6064
03:10:05,250 --> 03:10:07,170
But the right is just an empty darkness.

6065
03:10:07,950 --> 03:10:08,350
Yeah, like here, you mean?

6066
03:10:09,950 --> 03:10:11,850
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

6067
03:10:12,250 --> 03:10:13,490
Well, I almost didn't make that.

6068
03:10:13,870 --> 03:10:14,490
We go left?

6069
03:10:15,090 --> 03:10:15,750
Oh, thank you.

6070
03:10:15,750 --> 03:10:16,770
I think so.

6071
03:10:16,890 --> 03:10:23,350
So the other thing is because there's no food in here, you kind of just need to like, book it a little bit.

6072
03:10:23,770 --> 03:10:24,510
Can we go here?

6073
03:10:24,850 --> 03:10:26,290
I think we need to get to here, somehow.

6074
03:10:27,390 --> 03:10:27,710
We're going up.

6075
03:10:29,010 --> 03:10:29,830
We're going up.

6076
03:10:30,210 --> 03:10:31,150
It did not work out.

6077
03:10:31,350 --> 03:10:32,690
It does not look good though.

6078
03:10:33,570 --> 03:10:34,450
Come on, I caught you.

6079
03:10:34,650 --> 03:10:35,150
I'm good.

6080
03:10:35,490 --> 03:10:36,130
Yeah, I got you.

6081
03:10:36,430 --> 03:10:37,090
Got you too?

6082
03:10:37,590 --> 03:10:37,770
Okay.

6083
03:10:38,970 --> 03:10:39,910
I got her more.

6084
03:10:43,410 --> 03:10:44,270
I'm killing him.

6085
03:10:44,270 --> 03:10:44,410
Here.

6086
03:10:44,430 --> 03:10:45,770
For stamina.

6087
03:10:47,190 --> 03:10:47,650
Okay.

6088
03:10:48,150 --> 03:10:49,190
Okay, there's a place here too?

6089
03:10:50,070 --> 03:10:50,410
Yeah.

6090
03:10:51,330 --> 03:10:52,510
I think this place...

6091
03:10:52,510 --> 03:10:54,670
Amplified of the stamina, my growling stomach.

6092
03:10:55,590 --> 03:10:56,270
Oh, you hungry?

6093
03:10:56,890 --> 03:10:59,490
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

6094
03:10:59,610 --> 03:10:59,770
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

6095
03:10:59,770 --> 03:11:01,190
Little bit stuck, a little bit stuck.

6096
03:11:01,590 --> 03:11:03,270
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...

6097
03:11:03,270 --> 03:11:03,370
Whoa!

6098
03:11:04,990 --> 03:11:10,470
Whoa... What's going on with me?

6099
03:11:10,910 --> 03:11:12,230
What's going on?

6100
03:11:12,950 --> 03:11:16,450
Wait, what's going on, I can't...

6101
03:11:16,450 --> 03:11:17,210
pau ra lily!

6102
03:11:17,710 --> 03:11:22,350
Bailky, you need to separate from that surface a little bit, so try and drop down a little and then come back up.

6103
03:11:22,470 --> 03:11:23,270
You're stuck in the wall.

6104
03:11:23,270 --> 03:11:25,510
H- What's going on?

6105
03:11:25,950 --> 03:11:32,230
I don't know, that's what's going on what's going on...

6106
03:11:32,230 --> 03:11:34,030
What's going on?

6107
03:11:35,390 --> 03:11:40,250
I'm trying to figure out... I can't get out!

6108
03:11:42,650 --> 03:11:44,550
Someone help me!

6109
03:11:49,430 --> 03:11:51,030
Which one?

6110
03:11:51,710 --> 03:11:52,990
Is it a fully gone?

6111
03:11:55,270 --> 03:11:56,690
I don't know.

6112
03:11:57,070 --> 03:11:58,010
Am I?

6113
03:12:01,030 --> 03:12:03,150
Am I better now?

6114
03:12:08,130 --> 03:12:08,890
Guys!

6115
03:12:08,890 --> 03:12:09,650
Guys!

6116
03:12:10,070 --> 03:12:10,590
Guys!

6117
03:12:11,010 --> 03:12:11,390
What

6118
03:12:14,580 --> 03:12:15,480
did you do to me?

6119
03:12:19,480 --> 03:12:21,400
What did you do to me?

6120
03:12:25,040 --> 03:12:26,640
Okay, okay.

6121
03:12:28,360 --> 03:12:29,120
Okay.

6122
03:12:30,320 --> 03:12:30,860
Am I okay?

6123
03:12:33,720 --> 03:12:34,160
No.

6124
03:12:34,160 --> 03:12:34,860
Am I?

6125
03:12:35,060 --> 03:12:35,660
Oh, whoa, whoa!

6126
03:12:36,060 --> 03:12:37,320
Oh, it's tested on fire.

6127
03:12:37,660 --> 03:12:38,620
What did you do to me?

6128
03:12:38,840 --> 03:12:40,440
What did you do to me?

6129
03:12:40,940 --> 03:12:42,140
What did... I don't know.

6130
03:12:42,340 --> 03:12:43,900
What did you do to me?

6131
03:12:44,840 --> 03:12:47,780
Doki, have you ever seen the movie 127 Hours?

6132
03:12:48,980 --> 03:12:50,120
Oh, look, you fixed yourself.

6133
03:12:50,300 --> 03:12:51,320
I fixed myself.

6134
03:12:51,480 --> 03:12:52,080
I fixed myself.

6135
03:12:52,080 --> 03:12:54,520
I don't know if you even made it.

6136
03:12:54,900 --> 03:12:56,780
There's like... Is there anything up here?

6137
03:12:58,580 --> 03:13:02,620
So I think we're gonna have to try our best to climb on each other's heads and get up here maybe.

6138
03:13:03,400 --> 03:13:05,540
Or we take a very big leap over there.

6139
03:13:07,240 --> 03:13:07,720
Okay.

6140
03:13:07,720 --> 03:13:08,660
Don't trust me.

6141
03:13:09,360 --> 03:13:10,180
Get on my head.

6142
03:13:10,180 --> 03:13:11,200
That is a big one.

6143
03:13:11,380 --> 03:13:12,460
That is a really big one.

6144
03:13:12,640 --> 03:13:13,440
I'm a lollipop.

6145
03:13:14,460 --> 03:13:16,060
Wait, wait, why don't we just jump here?

6146
03:13:16,880 --> 03:13:17,320
Which one?

6147
03:13:18,280 --> 03:13:18,760
This way.

6148
03:13:19,260 --> 03:13:19,540
Oh.

6149
03:13:20,420 --> 03:13:21,080
That's what I said.

6150
03:13:21,940 --> 03:13:24,140
It is kind of big though, so it'd be kind of scary.

6151
03:13:24,300 --> 03:13:26,780
You'd have to like climb on this, I think, as a midway point.

6152
03:13:26,880 --> 03:13:27,120
Yeah.

6153
03:13:27,640 --> 03:13:29,780
It's hot too, so you're gonna take fire damage.

6154
03:13:31,480 --> 03:13:32,200
I'm scared.

6155
03:13:32,440 --> 03:13:33,620
I don't think I'm gonna make that.

6156
03:13:34,020 --> 03:13:35,340
Oh my gosh, she gained!

6157
03:13:35,900 --> 03:13:36,660
Wait, wait, wait.

6158
03:13:36,880 --> 03:13:37,740
How much stamina do you guys have?

6159
03:13:38,180 --> 03:13:40,300
Did you sprint for...

6160
03:13:40,300 --> 03:13:43,040
I did a lunge, but be careful if you don't have enough stamina.

6161
03:13:45,260 --> 03:13:47,900
You might be able to stand on top of this, actually, but it's hot.

6162
03:13:48,540 --> 03:13:50,100
Wait, I'm scared, guys.

6163
03:13:50,460 --> 03:13:50,540
I got you.

6164
03:13:50,900 --> 03:13:52,820
Should I eat my lollipop just in case?

6165
03:13:53,260 --> 03:13:53,900
If you just stand on top of this, just run.

6166
03:13:54,060 --> 03:13:55,520
The damage will fade away.

6167
03:13:55,520 --> 03:13:56,780
I'm gonna eat.

6168
03:14:02,320 --> 03:14:04,000
I got some rope too in case...

6169
03:14:04,000 --> 03:14:04,680
Yeah, you're good, you're good.

6170
03:14:04,800 --> 03:14:05,640
Just jump off and on here.

6171
03:14:05,860 --> 03:14:06,180
Yeah!

6172
03:14:07,680 --> 03:14:08,080
Yeah!

6173
03:14:09,100 --> 03:14:09,500
Yeah!

6174
03:14:10,300 --> 03:14:11,120
I have cookies.

6175
03:14:11,860 --> 03:14:12,900
I don't know where to go now.

6176
03:14:13,160 --> 03:14:14,120
Up here, I guess.

6177
03:14:14,580 --> 03:14:14,840
Okay.

6178
03:14:15,020 --> 03:14:17,040
Where's like the goal to get to?

6179
03:14:17,720 --> 03:14:19,600
To the top of the hole.

6180
03:14:20,420 --> 03:14:21,060
Oh, there is?

6181
03:14:21,840 --> 03:14:22,240
Yeah.

6182
03:14:23,800 --> 03:14:24,360
Oh.

6183
03:14:24,840 --> 03:14:27,500
I don't know how we're gonna get up from here, though.

6184
03:14:28,660 --> 03:14:29,420
No, me either.

6185
03:14:31,180 --> 03:14:31,940
I don't...

6186
03:14:31,940 --> 03:14:33,920
I really don't think there's like a way to go.

6187
03:14:36,100 --> 03:14:37,280
Clamming, I'm clamming.

6188
03:14:37,480 --> 03:14:38,300
Because we're losing stamina.

6189
03:14:38,660 --> 03:14:39,500
I have cookies.

6190
03:14:39,940 --> 03:14:40,340
I just...

6191
03:14:40,340 --> 03:14:41,240
I think...

6192
03:14:43,480 --> 03:14:44,420
There's cookies.

6193
03:14:45,860 --> 03:14:47,720
Oh god, this place is such a fucking bitch.

6194
03:14:47,920 --> 03:14:48,480
Wait, how about here?

6195
03:14:48,780 --> 03:14:50,120
There's two suitcases here.

6196
03:14:51,200 --> 03:14:51,980
Yeah, there are.

6197
03:14:52,520 --> 03:14:53,600
Maybe you can climb here?

6198
03:14:53,640 --> 03:14:55,540
We don't have any items, I assume.

6199
03:14:56,020 --> 03:14:56,520
Wait, if we...

6200
03:14:56,520 --> 03:14:58,660
If we get there, there's a suitcase and there's an item.

6201
03:14:58,840 --> 03:14:59,900
Maybe we can help the others.

6202
03:15:00,120 --> 03:15:00,880
How do you get up there?

6203
03:15:07,900 --> 03:15:08,640
Oh, thank you.

6204
03:15:09,140 --> 03:15:09,820
I got you.

6205
03:15:10,440 --> 03:15:10,900
Oh, nope.

6206
03:15:11,120 --> 03:15:12,120
You got your own.

6207
03:15:12,320 --> 03:15:12,800
You're all good.

6208
03:15:13,080 --> 03:15:14,920
Oh, I think we have to go through here.

6209
03:15:15,220 --> 03:15:15,320
Yeah.

6210
03:15:15,320 --> 03:15:17,960
If we even get up there, though, how do we get up here?

6211
03:15:17,960 --> 03:15:18,500
We...

6212
03:15:18,500 --> 03:15:19,360
I don't think we can.

6213
03:15:19,660 --> 03:15:20,100
That's...

6214
03:15:20,100 --> 03:15:20,920
Oh my god.

6215
03:15:21,040 --> 03:15:21,360
It's too high.

6216
03:15:21,360 --> 03:15:22,360
The only other place that looks...

6217
03:15:22,360 --> 03:15:23,680
I don't even know, actually.

6218
03:15:24,540 --> 03:15:25,060
You know what?

6219
03:15:25,220 --> 03:15:25,760
It's a class.

6220
03:15:26,040 --> 03:15:27,420
It's like a chain launcher.

6221
03:15:27,680 --> 03:15:29,040
Nothing looks feasible right now.

6222
03:15:29,480 --> 03:15:29,760
We...

6223
03:15:29,760 --> 03:15:30,080
We could...

6224
03:15:30,080 --> 03:15:32,760
We could go all the way around here, maybe.

6225
03:15:33,900 --> 03:15:34,420
But we're...

6226
03:15:34,420 --> 03:15:35,560
What do we do after that?

6227
03:15:35,940 --> 03:15:36,040
I think...

6228
03:15:36,040 --> 03:15:37,260
I think we need an item.

6229
03:15:38,220 --> 03:15:38,920
Oh, we saw something...

6230
03:15:38,920 --> 03:15:40,340
There's not even there, but...

6231
03:15:40,340 --> 03:15:41,960
Wait, doesn't the lollipop...

6232
03:15:43,060 --> 03:15:45,300
...make you go speedy fast over here?

6233
03:15:45,760 --> 03:15:47,100
It does, but only you.

6234
03:15:47,520 --> 03:15:48,820
Yeah, I can give it to you.

6235
03:15:48,980 --> 03:15:49,200
I...

6236
03:15:49,200 --> 03:15:49,700
I trust you.

6237
03:15:50,080 --> 03:15:51,320
I think I know what we could do.

6238
03:15:51,520 --> 03:15:51,680
What?

6239
03:15:52,440 --> 03:15:53,140
I think we need to use the firearms.

6240
03:15:53,140 --> 03:15:54,080
You should take the lollipop...

6241
03:15:54,080 --> 03:15:55,620
...and you should go up here.

6242
03:15:55,680 --> 03:15:59,380
You should use that energy to climb all the way up to this bridge...

6243
03:15:59,380 --> 03:15:59,720
Yeah?

6244
03:16:00,220 --> 03:16:01,400
...and try and get those lollipop.

6245
03:16:01,540 --> 03:16:02,280
Do you think it would work?

6246
03:16:02,440 --> 03:16:02,980
Do you think that's enough?

6247
03:16:03,000 --> 03:16:03,720
Alright, Limeo.

6248
03:16:03,720 --> 03:16:04,320
This is...

6249
03:16:04,320 --> 03:16:06,520
It's your time to shine, Scoutmaster.

6250
03:16:06,780 --> 03:16:06,900
No, no.

6251
03:16:07,000 --> 03:16:07,340
Hold on.

6252
03:16:08,260 --> 03:16:09,380
No, take this rope.

6253
03:16:09,720 --> 03:16:10,640
This is your lollipop.

6254
03:16:10,660 --> 03:16:11,140
No, wait.

6255
03:16:11,300 --> 03:16:11,740
No, I...

6256
03:16:11,740 --> 03:16:12,620
No, it's...

6257
03:16:13,140 --> 03:16:13,500
It's...

6258
03:16:13,500 --> 03:16:14,800
You should do it.

6259
03:16:14,800 --> 03:16:15,560
You should...

6260
03:16:15,560 --> 03:16:16,680
You are the most experienced.

6261
03:16:16,900 --> 03:16:17,940
I'm actually looking at this.

6262
03:16:18,160 --> 03:16:18,660
Look at this.

6263
03:16:18,820 --> 03:16:21,860
If we run across the hot rocks, we can actually get all the way up there.

6264
03:16:22,180 --> 03:16:22,980
That's what I said before.

6265
03:16:23,380 --> 03:16:23,600
Oh, okay.

6266
03:16:23,940 --> 03:16:24,660
Then we would go back?

6267
03:16:24,940 --> 03:16:25,160
We...

6268
03:16:25,160 --> 03:16:26,160
We can try that then.

6269
03:16:26,740 --> 03:16:27,180
Okay.

6270
03:16:27,420 --> 03:16:27,500
Yeah.

6271
03:16:29,140 --> 03:16:30,120
So, we're going back down?

6272
03:16:31,480 --> 03:16:32,720
I think so.

6273
03:16:33,180 --> 03:16:34,020
Where we came from?

6274
03:16:35,180 --> 03:16:35,620
Oh...

6275
03:16:37,380 --> 03:16:37,820
Oh...

6276
03:16:37,820 --> 03:16:38,460
Oh...

6277
03:16:38,460 --> 03:16:39,000
Nightman.

6278
03:16:40,700 --> 03:16:41,140
Oh...

6279
03:16:45,050 --> 03:16:45,490
Oh...

6280
03:16:45,490 --> 03:16:46,350
It's gonna hurt.

6281
03:16:48,410 --> 03:16:48,810
Yeah.

6282
03:16:50,630 --> 03:16:51,750
That's gonna hurt.

6283
03:16:52,030 --> 03:16:52,890
I gonna leave a mile.

6284
03:16:54,610 --> 03:16:55,370
Ain't much.

6285
03:16:55,950 --> 03:16:57,030
It's honest work.

6286
03:17:05,180 --> 03:17:05,980
Okay, you don't...

6287
03:17:05,980 --> 03:17:07,320
You only take like a tick if you're clay.

6288
03:17:07,600 --> 03:17:08,120
This one's...

6289
03:17:08,120 --> 03:17:08,340
Okay.

6290
03:17:08,880 --> 03:17:09,280
Gosh.

6291
03:17:09,500 --> 03:17:11,100
I took a lot more than a tick.

6292
03:17:11,200 --> 03:17:11,720
I almost died.

6293
03:17:12,060 --> 03:17:12,720
Be careful, guys.

6294
03:17:12,820 --> 03:17:13,160
Be careful.

6295
03:17:13,340 --> 03:17:14,180
Oh, okay.

6296
03:17:14,540 --> 03:17:15,340
Oh, okay.

6297
03:17:15,800 --> 03:17:16,360
I got it.

6298
03:17:16,540 --> 03:17:17,520
Yum yum yum yum.

6299
03:17:17,960 --> 03:17:18,180
Okay.

6300
03:17:18,180 --> 03:17:18,480
Thank you.

6301
03:17:20,480 --> 03:17:20,880
Okay.

6302
03:17:22,580 --> 03:17:22,980
Oh!

6303
03:17:24,960 --> 03:17:25,600
There we go.

6304
03:17:25,900 --> 03:17:27,140
I'm gonna be here and give you a lift up.

6305
03:17:28,760 --> 03:17:29,900
Boy, this is scary.

6306
03:17:31,280 --> 03:17:31,680
Uh-huh.

6307
03:17:34,000 --> 03:17:34,360
Thank you.

6308
03:17:35,200 --> 03:17:35,920
Yep, woof!

6309
03:17:37,240 --> 03:17:37,640
Wee!

6310
03:17:39,500 --> 03:17:39,900
Wee!

6311
03:17:41,660 --> 03:17:42,060
Wee!

6312
03:17:43,640 --> 03:17:44,040
Whoa!

6313
03:17:45,040 --> 03:17:47,700
Okay, so across the big rock and onto the bridge, you see what I mean?

6314
03:17:48,600 --> 03:17:49,000
What?

6315
03:17:49,000 --> 03:17:50,280
Uh, you should go first.

6316
03:17:50,440 --> 03:17:51,240
Yeah, you should go first.

6317
03:17:51,420 --> 03:17:53,240
I know what you mean, but you should go first.

6318
03:17:54,300 --> 03:17:56,300
Oh god, this is gonna be beans, actually.

6319
03:17:59,220 --> 03:17:59,580
Uh...

6320
03:18:00,960 --> 03:18:03,300
Oh, why is the music so intense now?

6321
03:18:03,480 --> 03:18:04,440
I know, I know, I don't know!

6322
03:18:04,440 --> 03:18:04,920
I don't know!

6323
03:18:09,360 --> 03:18:10,080
Ooh, here?

6324
03:18:11,700 --> 03:18:12,680
That is... maybe?

6325
03:18:22,720 --> 03:18:24,180
Oh my gosh, she's gaming.

6326
03:18:26,040 --> 03:18:27,640
Oh my god, what does she do?

6327
03:18:28,820 --> 03:18:29,140
What?

6328
03:18:30,100 --> 03:18:31,140
What does she do?

6329
03:18:31,620 --> 03:18:34,140
I didn't jump, I didn't jump, I'm going back, I'm going back, I didn't jump.

6330
03:18:34,340 --> 03:18:35,780
Grab me, grab me, somebody grab me.

6331
03:18:35,780 --> 03:18:36,980
I'm scared!

6332
03:18:37,220 --> 03:18:38,960
I didn't jump, I didn't jump, I didn't jump, I didn't jump.

6333
03:18:40,700 --> 03:18:41,700
Is that enough rope?

6334
03:18:41,820 --> 03:18:44,500
If you can get to this bit, is that enough rope for you to get up?

6335
03:18:44,760 --> 03:18:45,060
Sure!

6336
03:18:45,880 --> 03:18:46,020
Yeah.

6337
03:18:46,680 --> 03:18:47,960
You can put up a little bit more.

6338
03:18:49,380 --> 03:18:50,300
A little bit more?

6339
03:18:50,440 --> 03:18:52,240
That's about as much as I can do, apparently.

6340
03:18:52,240 --> 03:18:55,040
No, no, no, pull it back up a little bit.

6341
03:18:55,320 --> 03:18:56,420
Oh, okay, push that?

6342
03:18:56,420 --> 03:18:58,540
A little bit... yeah, yeah.

6343
03:19:00,060 --> 03:19:02,900
Still more, still more, still more, up up up up.

6344
03:19:03,060 --> 03:19:03,600
Ok, that's it.

6345
03:19:04,120 --> 03:19:05,160
No, that's true.

6346
03:19:05,620 --> 03:19:07,680
If that saves any extra rope, I'll take it.

6347
03:19:08,220 --> 03:19:09,560
I have rope too, so.

6348
03:19:10,100 --> 03:19:12,000
Ok, stuffy, I believe.

6349
03:19:12,900 --> 03:19:14,740
C werd zeerical voice from helpes Wow.

6350
03:19:14,740 --> 03:19:17,360
No, this isn't the way... take me.... t ok that's it.

6351
03:19:17,360 --> 03:19:18,100
I changed my mind again.

6352
03:19:20,480 --> 03:19:23,420
Guys I might be coke... I don't know if I can make this jump.

6353
03:19:23,640 --> 03:19:24,720
Alright, I believe Mint.

6354
03:19:28,240 --> 03:19:29,580
How did she do that?

6355
03:19:30,320 --> 03:19:30,540
Oh gosh.

6356
03:19:30,760 --> 03:19:31,440
Oh my gosh,

6357
03:19:38,060 --> 03:19:47,000
I'm not gonna make it.

6358
03:19:47,080 --> 03:19:47,620
I'm not gonna make it.

6359
03:19:47,740 --> 03:19:48,680
I'm not gonna make it.

6360
03:19:52,460 --> 03:19:53,600
Oh my god.

6361
03:19:53,960 --> 03:19:54,800
I made it.

6362
03:19:55,800 --> 03:19:56,880
I made it.

6363
03:19:58,280 --> 03:20:00,080
I made it.

6364
03:20:03,020 --> 03:20:05,920
Do you think we go across enough or do we stay here?

6365
03:20:06,120 --> 03:20:07,120
I think we might stay here.

6366
03:20:07,260 --> 03:20:07,700
Snuffy?

6367
03:20:09,260 --> 03:20:09,700
Snuffy?

6368
03:20:10,500 --> 03:20:10,940
Snuffy?

6369
03:20:11,820 --> 03:20:12,840
Guys, Snuffy?

6370
03:20:13,220 --> 03:20:14,900
I don't think Snuffy.

6371
03:20:15,040 --> 03:20:16,200
I don't think Snuffy made it.

6372
03:20:16,320 --> 03:20:17,560
You need cookie, man.

6373
03:20:18,080 --> 03:20:19,980
Oh, can I have one?

6374
03:20:20,200 --> 03:20:21,020
Yeah, that's all.

6375
03:20:21,500 --> 03:20:22,140
Here we go.

6376
03:20:22,140 --> 03:20:22,640
Okay, thank you.

6377
03:20:23,540 --> 03:20:26,020
Okay, thank you.

6378
03:20:29,020 --> 03:20:31,440
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

6379
03:20:31,460 --> 03:20:33,200
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

6380
03:20:33,400 --> 03:20:34,600
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

6381
03:20:35,320 --> 03:20:36,120
Hi, kids.

6382
03:20:36,380 --> 03:20:37,500
Up this way, I think.

6383
03:20:37,940 --> 03:20:38,860
Hello, I'm kid.

6384
03:20:38,860 --> 03:20:41,000
There was some medkits and lollipop.

6385
03:20:41,180 --> 03:20:41,980
And a lollipop, sorry.

6386
03:20:42,540 --> 03:20:42,980
Yay.

6387
03:20:45,080 --> 03:20:46,700
I'm a big boy now.

6388
03:20:48,100 --> 03:20:48,200
Hi.

6389
03:20:49,280 --> 03:20:52,160
I don't know if this is the way though because it gets very sheer again.

6390
03:20:52,320 --> 03:20:53,360
I'm wondering if we go across.

6391
03:20:54,580 --> 03:20:54,800
Oh.

6392
03:20:56,040 --> 03:20:56,480
Oh.

6393
03:20:56,980 --> 03:20:58,440
Like, both ways suck.

6394
03:20:58,440 --> 03:20:59,240
Oh.

6395
03:20:59,260 --> 03:20:59,580
Yeah.

6396
03:21:00,940 --> 03:21:01,400
Oh.

6397
03:21:03,520 --> 03:21:03,980
Oh.

6398
03:21:04,840 --> 03:21:05,300
Oh.

6399
03:21:06,000 --> 03:21:07,500
Oh, there you are, Snuffy.

6400
03:21:07,680 --> 03:21:08,780
What happened, Snuffy?

6401
03:21:08,960 --> 03:21:09,540
Hey, Snuffy.

6402
03:21:09,820 --> 03:21:10,240
Snuffy!

6403
03:21:10,320 --> 03:21:11,400
Unless I can get up this way.

6404
03:21:11,520 --> 03:21:11,820
It's okay.

6405
03:21:12,420 --> 03:21:12,880
It's okay.

6406
03:21:14,940 --> 03:21:17,580
I'm gonna wait until Lamo makes her executive.

6407
03:21:17,920 --> 03:21:19,280
I knew I wasn't gonna be able to do it.

6408
03:21:19,620 --> 03:21:23,080
Lamo, you sacrificed yourself for us.

6409
03:21:23,080 --> 03:21:24,100
I don't know.

6410
03:21:24,500 --> 03:21:25,360
It's so crazy.

6411
03:21:26,520 --> 03:21:27,660
You guys made it.

6412
03:21:27,800 --> 03:21:28,200
You didn't even go this way.

6413
03:21:28,200 --> 03:21:29,960
There's more luggage on the other side.

6414
03:21:30,320 --> 03:21:30,860
There's more luggage.

6415
03:21:30,860 --> 03:21:32,120
I think we can go this way, yeah.

6416
03:21:32,480 --> 03:21:32,680
Yeah.

6417
03:21:33,420 --> 03:21:38,520
You purposely didn't tell us that you were starving so we could save resources.

6418
03:21:38,680 --> 03:21:39,480
What are you?

6419
03:21:39,580 --> 03:21:40,740
I didn't think I was that low.

6420
03:21:41,080 --> 03:21:41,340
I don't know.

6421
03:21:43,640 --> 03:21:43,840
I don't know.

6422
03:21:44,100 --> 03:21:45,020
Where did we go?

6423
03:21:46,320 --> 03:21:47,280
We're going across.

6424
03:21:47,800 --> 03:21:48,640
Yeah, we're going across.

6425
03:21:49,800 --> 03:21:50,420
It's okay.

6426
03:21:50,600 --> 03:21:51,720
I took damage, but it's okay.

6427
03:21:52,420 --> 03:21:52,900
Oh.

6428
03:21:56,620 --> 03:21:58,560
I'm a little scared, guys.

6429
03:22:05,510 --> 03:22:07,990
Yeah, we should let Snuffy scout.

6430
03:22:08,170 --> 03:22:09,170
Do you think we do the hot rock or we go on the right?

6431
03:22:09,330 --> 03:22:10,930
I think the hot rock actually does a bit above it.

6432
03:22:11,110 --> 03:22:12,290
So I think we need to do the hot rock.

6433
03:22:12,290 --> 03:22:13,510
Snuffy should start scouting.

6434
03:22:17,870 --> 03:22:19,630
Wait, are you actually injured or just hot?

6435
03:22:20,370 --> 03:22:21,090
I'm injured.

6436
03:22:21,630 --> 03:22:22,790
She broke her leg.

6437
03:22:22,790 --> 03:22:23,190
Yeah.

6438
03:22:24,090 --> 03:22:24,630
Yeah.

6439
03:22:24,890 --> 03:22:25,210
Oh.

6440
03:22:26,910 --> 03:22:27,490
Ouchie, ouch.

6441
03:22:27,630 --> 03:22:27,870
Thank you.

6442
03:22:28,450 --> 03:22:28,930
Ouchie, ouch.

6443
03:22:28,930 --> 03:22:29,950
I think you should save it.

6444
03:22:30,610 --> 03:22:31,370
Oh, thank you.

6445
03:22:31,910 --> 03:22:32,430
Ouchie.

6446
03:22:34,350 --> 03:22:35,350
What do we do?

6447
03:22:36,230 --> 03:22:37,230
It's spicy here.

6448
03:22:38,390 --> 03:22:39,670
I'm going to go check.

6449
03:22:40,670 --> 03:22:41,390
Okay, I'm going back down.

6450
03:22:41,390 --> 03:22:41,830
Ouch.

6451
03:22:42,090 --> 03:22:43,130
My spicy legs.

6452
03:22:44,430 --> 03:22:45,270
Doki, come down here.

6453
03:22:45,270 --> 03:22:45,850
No, it's fine.

6454
03:22:45,970 --> 03:22:46,570
I'm safe here.

6455
03:22:49,230 --> 03:22:49,670
Yeah.

6456
03:22:50,030 --> 03:22:51,610
I'm safe in this little hole.

6457
03:22:52,350 --> 03:22:53,550
Okay, I'm going to the hole.

6458
03:22:54,230 --> 03:22:54,670
Nice.

6459
03:22:55,070 --> 03:22:55,370
Nice.

6460
03:22:59,130 --> 03:22:59,570
Okay.

6461
03:23:01,730 --> 03:23:02,690
Oh, fucky.

6462
03:23:03,890 --> 03:23:04,830
Yeah, you can stand.

6463
03:23:05,010 --> 03:23:05,790
Yeah, wherever you are.

6464
03:23:05,910 --> 03:23:07,070
And then you come up this hot rock here.

6465
03:23:07,370 --> 03:23:07,750
Ouch.

6466
03:23:08,030 --> 03:23:08,270
Ouch.

6467
03:23:08,530 --> 03:23:08,690
Ouch.

6468
03:23:08,690 --> 03:23:09,530
Ouch.

6469
03:23:10,630 --> 03:23:10,990
Ouch.

6470
03:23:11,870 --> 03:23:11,970
Ouch.

6471
03:23:24,610 --> 03:23:25,790
I'm burning.

6472
03:23:26,830 --> 03:23:29,350
I gotta wait until my feet sees.

6473
03:23:29,890 --> 03:23:32,130
My feet sees are too hot.

6474
03:23:33,230 --> 03:23:33,890
I gotta wait.

6475
03:23:37,440 --> 03:23:39,140
Just give me a sec.

6476
03:23:39,200 --> 03:23:40,780
My little feet sees.

6477
03:23:46,410 --> 03:23:47,310
I have a...

6478
03:23:47,310 --> 03:23:48,610
I have a lollipop.

6479
03:23:48,610 --> 03:23:50,450
Probably all the same amount of feet.

6480
03:24:00,560 --> 03:24:01,660
So I can rope for a mint.

6481
03:24:01,900 --> 03:24:03,460
Or do we try and keep it slightly higher?

6482
03:24:03,920 --> 03:24:05,300
Wait, how did you make this?

6483
03:24:06,640 --> 03:24:07,040
I...

6484
03:24:07,040 --> 03:24:07,500
How did I?

6485
03:24:07,900 --> 03:24:08,400
Uh, with...

6486
03:24:08,400 --> 03:24:09,080
I don't know.

6487
03:24:09,500 --> 03:24:09,940
With the...

6488
03:24:09,940 --> 03:24:11,600
There's a spot to stand on the hot rock.

6489
03:24:12,440 --> 03:24:13,180
Yeah, there it is.

6490
03:24:13,940 --> 03:24:14,640
No, it's not.

6491
03:24:14,740 --> 03:24:15,360
It's not it.

6492
03:24:16,200 --> 03:24:17,200
Oh wait, there it is.

6493
03:24:17,940 --> 03:24:19,700
I don't know if I can make this now though.

6494
03:24:19,720 --> 03:24:20,220
You just gotta catch it.

6495
03:24:20,360 --> 03:24:21,240
You just gotta catch it.

6496
03:24:22,400 --> 03:24:22,800
Okay.

6497
03:24:23,200 --> 03:24:23,560
Alright.

6498
03:24:23,860 --> 03:24:24,080
Wait, wait.

6499
03:24:24,260 --> 03:24:24,980
Oh, you can?

6500
03:24:25,160 --> 03:24:25,820
Okay, hold on.

6501
03:24:26,880 --> 03:24:28,140
I'm going to eat this.

6502
03:24:28,400 --> 03:24:33,720
Mint, my chat tells me that if I knock you out with a blowgun and you sleep safely, you won't be hungry anymore.

6503
03:24:34,260 --> 03:24:34,900
Oh, okay.

6504
03:24:36,580 --> 03:24:37,600
Wait, you have a blowgun?

6505
03:24:38,000 --> 03:24:38,620
Mint's lowest.

6506
03:24:38,800 --> 03:24:39,280
Mint's lowest.

6507
03:24:39,480 --> 03:24:39,800
Come here, Mint.

6508
03:24:40,360 --> 03:24:41,380
Yeah, I have a lollipop.

6509
03:24:41,920 --> 03:24:42,640
Put yourself here.

6510
03:24:43,060 --> 03:24:43,140
Okay.

6511
03:24:43,180 --> 03:24:43,860
Knock me out!

6512
03:24:45,980 --> 03:24:47,820
Oh, okay.

6513
03:24:48,280 --> 03:24:48,740
Go to sleep.

6514
03:24:49,020 --> 03:24:49,400
I'll see you in a minute.

6515
03:24:49,900 --> 03:24:50,360
Good night.

6516
03:24:51,440 --> 03:24:51,720
Oh.

6517
03:24:52,020 --> 03:24:53,440
I thought we picked her up or something.

6518
03:24:53,440 --> 03:24:56,220
What if I pick her up and chuck her into the lab?

6519
03:24:56,780 --> 03:24:58,020
Pick her up for a little bit.

6520
03:24:58,100 --> 03:24:59,520
Just pick her up and hold her for a little bit.

6521
03:24:59,580 --> 03:24:59,920
Just in case.

6522
03:25:00,100 --> 03:25:01,400
I don't know if it, like, causes a problem.

6523
03:25:03,000 --> 03:25:07,400
What if I accidentally- What if I accidentally- Unironically play with motion blur?

6524
03:25:07,560 --> 03:25:08,580
What's wrong with you people?

6525
03:25:08,940 --> 03:25:10,200
Wait, I have motion blur on?

6526
03:25:11,320 --> 03:25:11,960
Did you not?

6527
03:25:12,080 --> 03:25:12,820
I feel like you did.

6528
03:25:13,460 --> 03:25:16,640
Wait, did I- Did I actually put motion blur on?

6529
03:25:17,960 --> 03:25:18,900
Where is it?

6530
03:25:19,000 --> 03:25:20,260
There's no motion blur anywhere.

6531
03:25:22,640 --> 03:25:23,580
What do you mean?

6532
03:25:23,820 --> 03:25:24,320
I'm awake!

6533
03:25:24,940 --> 03:25:25,740
I think I'm free!

6534
03:25:26,220 --> 03:25:27,280
Are you hungry anymore?

6535
03:25:27,540 --> 03:25:28,380
I'm not!

6536
03:25:28,960 --> 03:25:29,880
Oh my god!

6537
03:25:30,700 --> 03:25:33,220
I'm letting the Z's go away and then I'll be okay.

6538
03:25:34,100 --> 03:25:36,160
Okay, then you spot the next one above up here.

6539
03:25:36,420 --> 03:25:39,480
Also, if Doki hadn't picked me up, I would have died.

6540
03:25:39,480 --> 03:25:40,160
Oh.

6541
03:25:43,080 --> 03:25:46,960
I was just like, we were just looking at your body for the longest time.

6542
03:25:50,500 --> 03:25:51,760
Where do we go from here?

6543
03:25:53,520 --> 03:25:54,600
I don't know, I haven't looked yet.

6544
03:25:55,220 --> 03:25:57,160
I think another hot rock jump is in order.

6545
03:25:57,780 --> 03:25:58,320
This one?

6546
03:26:01,100 --> 03:26:02,580
Yeah, there's also this part here.

6547
03:26:02,760 --> 03:26:03,460
This isn't bad.

6548
03:26:04,260 --> 03:26:05,440
What are you doing next?

6549
03:26:06,840 --> 03:26:08,060
There's this whole bit here.

6550
03:26:08,260 --> 03:26:08,800
Let me have a look.

6551
03:26:09,720 --> 03:26:11,480
A-ba-ba.

6552
03:26:13,660 --> 03:26:14,680
A-ba-ba.

6553
03:26:14,820 --> 03:26:15,000
A-ba-ba-ba.

6554
03:26:15,960 --> 03:26:16,600
Oh god.

6555
03:26:16,900 --> 03:26:17,040
Oh.

6556
03:26:17,240 --> 03:26:18,880
I'm waiting for that...

6557
03:26:18,880 --> 03:26:20,780
Lamu's executive decision.

6558
03:26:21,640 --> 03:26:21,900
Okay.

6559
03:26:22,520 --> 03:26:22,800
Oof.

6560
03:26:26,120 --> 03:26:27,960
Okay, yeah, there's lots of places to sit here.

6561
03:26:28,740 --> 03:26:29,220
Okay.

6562
03:26:30,160 --> 03:26:30,460
Okay.

6563
03:26:32,000 --> 03:26:33,180
I didn't really...

6564
03:26:33,180 --> 03:26:35,120
I didn't really know what she did, but okay.

6565
03:26:35,520 --> 03:26:35,840
Oh, okay.

6566
03:26:36,120 --> 03:26:36,540
Alright.

6567
03:26:37,880 --> 03:26:38,620
You're okay.

6568
03:26:38,780 --> 03:26:39,480
You'll see it.

6569
03:26:39,520 --> 03:26:40,640
It's pretty straightforward, actually.

6570
03:26:42,100 --> 03:26:42,780
Oh, I see it.

6571
03:26:47,340 --> 03:26:47,820
Yeah.

6572
03:26:47,820 --> 03:26:48,640
And then...

6573
03:26:48,640 --> 03:26:49,480
The left side.

6574
03:26:49,660 --> 03:26:50,060
Over there.

6575
03:26:50,160 --> 03:26:50,620
Turn around.

6576
03:26:50,740 --> 03:26:51,140
Turn around.

6577
03:26:52,360 --> 03:26:53,120
Oh, here?

6578
03:26:53,900 --> 03:26:54,880
Oh, I see it.

6579
03:26:55,160 --> 03:26:56,380
There's this full-spit perception here.

6580
03:26:59,540 --> 03:27:00,020
Ow.

6581
03:27:00,380 --> 03:27:01,400
My feet sees.

6582
03:27:02,400 --> 03:27:03,200
You got it?

6583
03:27:03,600 --> 03:27:04,520
Yeah, I got it.

6584
03:27:04,560 --> 03:27:04,740
Wait.

6585
03:27:04,980 --> 03:27:05,360
Why am I...

6586
03:27:05,360 --> 03:27:06,540
Why am I attached to the wall?

6587
03:27:06,660 --> 03:27:06,900
What the heck?

6588
03:27:07,680 --> 03:27:08,800
Oh my god, that's skewed.

6589
03:27:09,080 --> 03:27:09,380
I got...

6590
03:27:09,380 --> 03:27:09,940
I got it.

6591
03:27:12,340 --> 03:27:12,700
Okay.

6592
03:27:12,940 --> 03:27:13,120
Yeah!

6593
03:27:13,260 --> 03:27:14,320
Wait, did you...

6594
03:27:14,320 --> 03:27:15,220
How did you make that?

6595
03:27:15,620 --> 03:27:16,520
Wait, how did you make that?

6596
03:27:16,920 --> 03:27:17,160
This way.

6597
03:27:17,280 --> 03:27:18,180
I'll put my arm up for you.

6598
03:27:18,820 --> 03:27:19,120
Okay.

6599
03:27:19,820 --> 03:27:20,180
Okay.

6600
03:27:20,180 --> 03:27:21,260
I got you.

6601
03:27:21,360 --> 03:27:21,800
I got you.

6602
03:27:22,620 --> 03:27:23,520
I got you.

6603
03:27:24,240 --> 03:27:25,200
My turn.

6604
03:27:26,980 --> 03:27:27,960
My turn.

6605
03:27:29,160 --> 03:27:29,680
Yeah.

6606
03:27:29,800 --> 03:27:30,320
Yay.

6607
03:27:34,850 --> 03:27:36,730
We're almost there, we're almost there.

6608
03:27:36,970 --> 03:27:37,210
We're almost there.

6609
03:27:37,210 --> 03:27:37,630
Where are we?

6610
03:27:37,950 --> 03:27:38,430
Almost there.

6611
03:27:38,770 --> 03:27:39,730
I see the light.

6612
03:27:40,530 --> 03:27:41,530
I see the light.

6613
03:27:42,170 --> 03:27:43,750
The light, it calls for me.

6614
03:27:43,930 --> 03:27:45,350
Do I go straight to the light?

6615
03:27:46,470 --> 03:27:46,830
Yeah.

6616
03:27:47,470 --> 03:27:48,350
Go to the light.

6617
03:27:48,750 --> 03:27:49,030
Yay.

6618
03:27:53,010 --> 03:27:53,530
Okay.

6619
03:27:53,530 --> 03:27:55,070
Okay, there's a spot to stand just below me.

6620
03:27:55,230 --> 03:27:55,570
You're good.

6621
03:27:55,910 --> 03:27:56,790
Yep, sorry.

6622
03:27:57,030 --> 03:27:57,830
Sorry to push you.

6623
03:27:59,150 --> 03:28:00,030
You're fine, you're fine.

6624
03:28:00,730 --> 03:28:01,470
I'm behind you, okay?

6625
03:28:01,850 --> 03:28:02,510
There you are.

6626
03:28:04,690 --> 03:28:05,090
Here?

6627
03:28:06,450 --> 03:28:07,010
I think so.

6628
03:28:07,010 --> 03:28:07,730
Oh my gosh, you guys!

6629
03:28:07,950 --> 03:28:08,370
I can see!

6630
03:28:09,570 --> 03:28:10,710
Oh my god, I see!

6631
03:28:11,050 --> 03:28:11,590
Okay, guys!

6632
03:28:11,890 --> 03:28:12,270
You're hungry!

6633
03:28:12,810 --> 03:28:13,210
Oh?

6634
03:28:15,110 --> 03:28:16,050
I'm not hungry.

6635
03:28:17,210 --> 03:28:18,490
I'm so hungry.

6636
03:28:18,810 --> 03:28:24,730
Okay, do we need- I think we need to go across the hot rock because we could go up here, but there's nowhere from there to go.

6637
03:28:25,170 --> 03:28:28,110
I did lose my rope, I think, from the thing.

6638
03:28:28,310 --> 03:28:29,210
Oh, you didn't pick that up?

6639
03:28:29,210 --> 03:28:30,390
I should've dropped it, yeah.

6640
03:28:30,790 --> 03:28:31,010
Oh!

6641
03:28:31,170 --> 03:28:31,510
That's okay.

6642
03:28:32,510 --> 03:28:34,370
I don't know if we can do this.

6643
03:28:36,030 --> 03:28:37,350
Let me- let me do a quick check.

6644
03:28:37,870 --> 03:28:38,170
Okay.

6645
03:28:38,450 --> 03:28:40,670
There is that loo- there is that luggage right there.

6646
03:28:40,690 --> 03:28:42,390
Looks like you can stand there, where you're going.

6647
03:28:42,910 --> 03:28:45,070
Yeah, but like where else would she go after that, though?

6648
03:28:45,790 --> 03:28:46,390
Oh, yeah.

6649
03:28:47,130 --> 03:28:47,750
That's the thing.

6650
03:28:47,850 --> 03:28:48,150
Is it a raft, maybe?

6651
03:28:49,230 --> 03:28:51,850
Oh, wait!

6652
03:28:56,090 --> 03:28:58,210
I don't think she's gonna make it, guys.

6653
03:28:59,690 --> 03:29:02,030
If you- Did she make it?

6654
03:29:02,170 --> 03:29:02,810
She made it.

6655
03:29:03,170 --> 03:29:05,710
It's not that way, so she'll come back to come down.

6656
03:29:06,130 --> 03:29:07,970
I made it, but I picked up through mine.

6657
03:29:09,270 --> 03:29:09,750
Aww.

6658
03:29:10,630 --> 03:29:12,110
So we have to go this way?

6659
03:29:12,430 --> 03:29:16,430
Maybe the left side here, these- these rocks- this formation over here.

6660
03:29:16,810 --> 03:29:17,470
This one?

6661
03:29:18,050 --> 03:29:18,870
Yeah, here.

6662
03:29:19,690 --> 03:29:23,790
You might be able to get more footing there, without having to go so long between your stamina.

6663
03:29:24,830 --> 03:29:26,050
Yeah, like- Don't cry, man.

6664
03:29:26,550 --> 03:29:27,170
Yeah, yeah.

6665
03:29:27,630 --> 03:29:28,250
Yeah, yeah.

6666
03:29:29,230 --> 03:29:29,730
Got you.

6667
03:29:30,430 --> 03:29:34,430
Maybe- maybe Baimu can lift you if you make it up to the second- It's fine, I'm not hurt.

6668
03:29:34,750 --> 03:29:36,190
I just don't have stamina.

6669
03:29:36,410 --> 03:29:38,310
I think- I think we go around, don't we?

6670
03:29:38,530 --> 03:29:39,890
I got my arm out!

6671
03:29:39,890 --> 03:29:41,550
I don't know if I can make it.

6672
03:29:41,670 --> 03:29:44,250
Cause my sa- my hunger is so bad now.

6673
03:29:47,990 --> 03:29:48,470
Woo!

6674
03:29:49,790 --> 03:29:52,230
I just made that, oh my god.

6675
03:29:52,490 --> 03:29:54,530
Just barely, just barely.

6676
03:29:54,950 --> 03:29:55,610
How about here?

6677
03:29:56,110 --> 03:29:59,290
Going into a ma- well, actually, you- Where's Laimo?

6678
03:29:59,550 --> 03:30:00,610
I don't think you have anywhere to go from there.

6679
03:30:00,730 --> 03:30:01,710
That's probably bad.

6680
03:30:02,050 --> 03:30:03,370
I'm gonna be falling, sorry, hold on.

6681
03:30:03,870 --> 03:30:04,390
You're fine.

6682
03:30:05,130 --> 03:30:05,450
Yeah.

6683
03:30:05,770 --> 03:30:06,470
You score all you need.

6684
03:30:07,370 --> 03:30:09,030
There's nowhere to go, don't go up there.

6685
03:30:09,030 --> 03:30:10,210
You're gonna fall and die.

6686
03:30:10,490 --> 03:30:11,830
It's ok, I- No!

6687
03:30:11,990 --> 03:30:12,750
I grabbed it.

6688
03:30:12,970 --> 03:30:14,050
We grabbed each other.

6689
03:30:14,850 --> 03:30:15,930
We grabbed each other.

6690
03:30:16,290 --> 03:30:17,690
We grabbed each other, we're here.

6691
03:30:17,710 --> 03:30:18,830
There's really nowhere to go.

6692
03:30:18,990 --> 03:30:21,150
You'll have to see if you can grab Laimu's hand up there.

6693
03:30:21,810 --> 03:30:22,290
Ah.

6694
03:30:22,290 --> 03:30:23,310
Where is she though?

6695
03:30:23,630 --> 03:30:24,930
Oh, she's over there!

6696
03:30:25,050 --> 03:30:28,450
I'm not here but there's nowhere really up- That's the problem.

6697
03:30:28,610 --> 03:30:30,090
How do we get here?

6698
03:30:30,150 --> 03:30:30,630
No!

6699
03:30:30,790 --> 03:30:31,430
What do we do?

6700
03:30:32,410 --> 03:30:34,390
What do we do??

6701
03:30:34,390 --> 03:30:35,210
What about here?

6702
03:30:36,850 --> 03:30:37,330
Uh...

6703
03:30:37,330 --> 03:30:38,470
Is there anything here?

6704
03:30:45,220 --> 03:30:48,740
Oh, I have the lollipop, but I'm scared.

6705
03:30:49,100 --> 03:30:55,680
I think, Doki, I think if you took the lollipop, if you climbed up there and then took the lollipop, you could probably make it to that bridge.

6706
03:30:55,680 --> 03:30:58,040
But you wouldn't have to let yourself take a break at all.

6707
03:30:58,220 --> 03:30:59,400
You definitely go straight there.

6708
03:31:00,360 --> 03:31:04,000
But it'll make you tired, but your stamina will go crazy and it'll be really fast.

6709
03:31:04,120 --> 03:31:08,020
Do I... Okay, well, we'll let her use the lollipop first.

6710
03:31:08,900 --> 03:31:09,340
Yeah.

6711
03:31:11,200 --> 03:31:12,280
Oh my god, look her go.

6712
03:31:12,440 --> 03:31:13,720
She's like a little spider monkey.

6713
03:31:15,100 --> 03:31:16,180
Woah, she's zooming.

6714
03:31:16,560 --> 03:31:17,420
Yeah, look her go.

6715
03:31:17,720 --> 03:31:18,400
Oh my god.

6716
03:31:18,620 --> 03:31:19,320
Oh my god.

6717
03:31:20,320 --> 03:31:21,700
Woah, woah, woah.

6718
03:31:22,080 --> 03:31:23,380
Woah, woah.

6719
03:31:27,300 --> 03:31:28,380
Woah, woah.

6720
03:31:28,700 --> 03:31:29,640
Woah, woah.

6721
03:31:30,880 --> 03:31:31,160
Woah, woah.

6722
03:31:31,160 --> 03:31:32,660
I think you guys are just going crazy.

6723
03:31:33,180 --> 03:31:34,360
Oh, she made it.

6724
03:31:34,440 --> 03:31:35,200
Oh, she made it.

6725
03:31:35,780 --> 03:31:37,120
Oh, there's a chaingun.

6726
03:31:38,940 --> 03:31:39,980
But I don't know how...

6727
03:31:39,980 --> 03:31:40,960
It's actually a rope cannon.

6728
03:31:41,200 --> 03:31:41,540
Less good.

6729
03:31:42,720 --> 03:31:44,160
Less good all day.

6730
03:31:44,220 --> 03:31:46,460
She can still use it to make you guys get up somewhere.

6731
03:31:46,720 --> 03:31:47,240
Maybe, hopefully.

6732
03:31:47,460 --> 03:31:50,960
Oh my god, there's a little hole here that scared the shit out of me.

6733
03:31:51,000 --> 03:31:51,840
I could have disappeared.

6734
03:31:52,380 --> 03:31:53,420
How do you use the...

6735
03:31:53,420 --> 03:31:54,280
Dude, where do I go?

6736
03:31:54,480 --> 03:31:55,880
Where do I lower the rope from?

6737
03:31:56,020 --> 03:31:56,400
Like, where would be...

6738
03:31:56,400 --> 03:31:57,760
I don't even know how...

6739
03:31:57,760 --> 03:31:58,980
I think like...

6740
03:31:58,980 --> 03:32:00,060
Min and I are fucked.

6741
03:32:00,060 --> 03:32:00,580
I...

6742
03:32:00,580 --> 03:32:02,000
I mean, this is...

6743
03:32:02,000 --> 03:32:02,760
I see it.

6744
03:32:02,780 --> 03:32:03,320
I see it.

6745
03:32:03,420 --> 03:32:03,440
I see it.

6746
03:32:03,440 --> 03:32:03,580
Okay.

6747
03:32:04,000 --> 03:32:05,460
I think...

6748
03:32:07,780 --> 03:32:09,160
We're getting hungry.

6749
03:32:09,720 --> 03:32:14,240
The only place that they can reach that, I think, from where you are, is that second bottom bridge.

6750
03:32:14,620 --> 03:32:17,700
That's not all the way connected to the wall, but it's beneath this bridge.

6751
03:32:18,080 --> 03:32:21,960
They might be able to jump on that, but it would be in the...

6752
03:32:24,420 --> 03:32:26,200
Can you get to this, maybe?

6753
03:32:27,020 --> 03:32:28,380
Okay, we'll get back there.

6754
03:32:28,600 --> 03:32:28,720
That?

6755
03:32:28,720 --> 03:32:29,000
Yeah.

6756
03:32:29,240 --> 03:32:30,240
Let me think though.

6757
03:32:30,420 --> 03:32:30,740
I can't...

6758
03:32:30,740 --> 03:32:33,300
I can't drop, because I won't be able to get back up.

6759
03:32:34,700 --> 03:32:35,960
I have a lollipop.

6760
03:32:38,540 --> 03:32:39,580
Just for time.

6761
03:32:40,400 --> 03:32:41,980
I can try and get there.

6762
03:32:42,200 --> 03:32:43,980
Or do you want to shoot the rope first?

6763
03:32:45,260 --> 03:32:45,820
Well wait, hold on.

6764
03:32:45,940 --> 03:32:47,020
Let me try and get above you.

6765
03:32:47,920 --> 03:32:49,800
Do I use my lollipop now?

6766
03:32:49,800 --> 03:32:49,920
No?

6767
03:32:52,860 --> 03:32:53,820
I'm gonna do it.

6768
03:32:55,100 --> 03:32:57,340
Oh gosh, your eyes are going into the back end.

6769
03:32:57,380 --> 03:32:58,300
I'm gonna try and get above you.

6770
03:32:59,420 --> 03:33:00,500
She's having a vision.

6771
03:33:00,700 --> 03:33:01,680
I'm having a vision.

6772
03:33:01,860 --> 03:33:02,600
I'm gonna do it.

6773
03:33:02,740 --> 03:33:03,300
Watch this.

6774
03:33:03,560 --> 03:33:04,480
What do you see, Raven?

6775
03:33:04,700 --> 03:33:05,320
What do you see?

6776
03:33:05,500 --> 03:33:05,760
Are you ready?

6777
03:33:05,920 --> 03:33:06,820
I'm gonna do it.

6778
03:33:06,900 --> 03:33:07,500
Don't do it.

6779
03:33:07,580 --> 03:33:08,520
We don't know where to go here.

6780
03:33:08,520 --> 03:33:09,540
I'm gonna do...

6781
03:33:09,540 --> 03:33:10,840
Just make it to the bridge, Dogey.

6782
03:33:10,880 --> 03:33:11,800
Go straight for the bridge.

6783
03:33:12,160 --> 03:33:13,440
We have to get...

6784
03:33:13,440 --> 03:33:15,740
You're probably abandoning this, but...

6785
03:33:15,740 --> 03:33:16,060
Yes.

6786
03:33:16,760 --> 03:33:17,500
That's fine.

6787
03:33:17,500 --> 03:33:19,960
I would sound like I've helped you out or anything.

6788
03:33:21,700 --> 03:33:23,060
One of us has to...

6789
03:33:23,060 --> 03:33:25,340
Wait, do I take the lollipop and I go this way?

6790
03:33:25,440 --> 03:33:26,800
The right side or the left side?

6791
03:33:27,520 --> 03:33:28,060
The right...

6792
03:33:28,060 --> 03:33:30,000
You have to go right side and climb up the bridge.

6793
03:33:30,280 --> 03:33:30,980
That's the only way to go.

6794
03:33:30,980 --> 03:33:31,440
This way?

6795
03:33:31,840 --> 03:33:32,480
This way?

6796
03:33:32,480 --> 03:33:33,020
No.

6797
03:33:33,020 --> 03:33:33,580
Wait, wait, wait.

6798
03:33:33,580 --> 03:33:35,080
Can you see the road?

6799
03:33:35,860 --> 03:33:36,240
No.

6800
03:33:37,020 --> 03:33:39,540
We see it, but there was no way we're getting that road.

6801
03:33:40,280 --> 03:33:40,620
No.

6802
03:33:41,340 --> 03:33:41,560
Hold on.

6803
03:33:43,500 --> 03:33:44,280
Wait, wait, wait.

6804
03:33:44,440 --> 03:33:45,360
So do I go...

6805
03:33:45,360 --> 03:33:45,480
Okay.

6806
03:33:46,120 --> 03:33:47,240
Snuffy, do I go this way?

6807
03:33:47,460 --> 03:33:48,140
Oh my god.

6808
03:33:48,420 --> 03:33:49,020
Wait, no, no.

6809
03:33:49,020 --> 03:33:49,620
You would go...

6810
03:33:49,620 --> 03:33:51,280
You would go this way, I think.

6811
03:33:51,420 --> 03:33:52,880
Either up to this ledge and then you...

6812
03:33:52,880 --> 03:33:52,900
Yeah.

6813
03:33:53,320 --> 03:33:54,500
I think you go this way.

6814
03:33:54,500 --> 03:33:55,620
Or you just go straight up.

6815
03:33:55,860 --> 03:33:56,000
Alright.

6816
03:33:57,520 --> 03:33:57,900
Sayonara.

6817
03:33:59,680 --> 03:34:00,120
How can I say it?

6818
03:34:00,120 --> 03:34:01,980
I'll try.

6819
03:34:02,660 --> 03:34:03,800
I won't stay until she goes.

6820
03:34:04,800 --> 03:34:05,460
I'll go.

6821
03:34:05,840 --> 03:34:05,940
AR energia.

6822
03:34:06,320 --> 03:34:07,540
Is there anywhere up there to stand?

6823
03:34:07,980 --> 03:34:08,420
Yeah.

6824
03:34:09,020 --> 03:34:09,460
Oh my god.

6825
03:34:10,320 --> 03:34:11,040
Can you...

6826
03:34:11,040 --> 03:34:12,720
Is the rope any better from here, or no good?

6827
03:34:13,300 --> 03:34:14,000
Oh my god.

6828
03:34:14,140 --> 03:34:15,160
A little bit actually.

6829
03:34:15,460 --> 03:34:16,220
That's not terrible.

6830
03:34:16,700 --> 03:34:17,140
Sayonara!

6831
03:34:18,160 --> 03:34:18,600
OkayAY!

6832
03:34:20,140 --> 03:34:21,020
MICHAELfö Himselfge.

6833
03:34:24,720 --> 03:34:30,620
I did, but I had so little stamina that I couldn't- I couldn't go anywhere.

6834
03:34:31,220 --> 03:34:33,640
Oh my god, you should've given it to me.

6835
03:34:42,360 --> 03:34:44,120
I'm gonna burn, guys.

6836
03:34:56,870 --> 03:34:57,950
Wait, I see you!

6837
03:34:58,030 --> 03:34:58,390
Wait, wait, wait!

6838
03:34:58,550 --> 03:34:59,470
I can come back!

6839
03:35:07,270 --> 03:35:11,590
I thought the lollipop would give me a little bit of, like, food.

6840
03:35:13,550 --> 03:35:14,530
Wait, Min, Min, Min!

6841
03:35:15,830 --> 03:35:18,710
Yeah, Min, give me your hand, give me your hand, I'm like literally right below you.

6842
03:35:18,830 --> 03:35:19,310
I don't know.

6843
03:35:20,390 --> 03:35:20,710
Okay.

6844
03:35:20,710 --> 03:35:22,570
Come on, come on!

6845
03:35:22,730 --> 03:35:23,050
Yay!

6846
03:35:24,450 --> 03:35:25,310
Yeah, okay.

6847
03:35:25,630 --> 03:35:26,990
Okay, now we don't know.

6848
03:35:27,150 --> 03:35:27,410
We're just trapped in here.

6849
03:35:27,410 --> 03:35:29,470
Yeah, now we're just trapped here.

6850
03:35:34,530 --> 03:35:36,830
I can't believe you're still alive.

6851
03:35:37,210 --> 03:35:38,470
I didn't.

6852
03:35:38,550 --> 03:35:38,810
Nene.

6853
03:35:41,770 --> 03:35:43,010
With Nene.

6854
03:35:43,750 --> 03:35:44,730
Immunity in this game.

6855
03:35:44,910 --> 03:35:45,590
You keep falling.

6856
03:35:46,710 --> 03:35:49,670
No, we're not gonna reach that.

6857
03:35:49,670 --> 03:35:51,230
We're not gonna make it!

6858
03:35:51,310 --> 03:35:51,910
Lai-mu!

6859
03:35:52,430 --> 03:35:52,890
Don't scout!

6860
03:35:53,190 --> 03:35:53,770
Lai-mu!

6861
03:35:53,810 --> 03:35:54,310
Lai-mu!

6862
03:35:54,370 --> 03:35:55,710
Min and I are gonna jump off!

6863
03:35:55,990 --> 03:35:57,410
You go on without us!

6864
03:35:57,530 --> 03:35:58,090
Wait, we are?

6865
03:35:58,210 --> 03:35:58,930
We're gonna jump off.

6866
03:35:59,410 --> 03:36:02,090
So, the Scout Master, the Scout Master will kill her.

6867
03:36:02,750 --> 03:36:04,130
We have to do it for Lai-mu.

6868
03:36:04,130 --> 03:36:05,490
Oh, for time the Scout Master will kill you!

6869
03:36:05,730 --> 03:36:07,370
We're gonna do it, Lai-mu!

6870
03:36:07,610 --> 03:36:10,670
We're gonna sacrifice ourselves for you!

6871
03:36:10,990 --> 03:36:11,370
Come on!

6872
03:36:26,700 --> 03:36:29,340
I'm so hungry now, I don't know if I can do it.

6873
03:36:32,700 --> 03:36:35,160
It's all up to you, Lai-mu!

6874
03:36:35,980 --> 03:36:37,940
It's all up to you!

6875
03:36:39,020 --> 03:36:39,800
Lai-mu!

6876
03:36:40,040 --> 03:36:40,800
Lai-mu!

6877
03:36:42,760 --> 03:36:43,740
It's so close!

6878
03:36:44,000 --> 03:36:45,100
Oh my gosh, it's right there!

6879
03:36:45,300 --> 03:36:45,740
It's right there!

6880
03:36:45,840 --> 03:36:47,260
It's literally right there, Lai-mu!

6881
03:36:49,380 --> 03:36:50,680
I can't quite reach it.

6882
03:36:50,900 --> 03:36:52,020
Oh my gosh, she's EP!

6883
03:36:52,600 --> 03:36:55,000
She's EP and she's so hungry!

6884
03:36:55,660 --> 03:36:56,380
Use the rope gun!

6885
03:36:56,580 --> 03:36:56,700
Use the rope gun!

6886
03:36:56,700 --> 03:36:58,260
Wait, there's a luggage right behind you!

6887
03:36:58,380 --> 03:36:59,440
There's a luggage right behind you!

6888
03:36:59,660 --> 03:37:01,960
I wanna go for the luggage instead, but...

6889
03:37:01,960 --> 03:37:02,080
Ugh!

6890
03:37:03,720 --> 03:37:04,480
I don't know...

6891
03:37:04,480 --> 03:37:05,720
I couldn't- I couldn't get up there.

6892
03:37:08,620 --> 03:37:10,540
And someone said drop the pool!

6893
03:37:10,660 --> 03:37:18,980
I don't think you- It's time, you got- you can't wait too long!

6894
03:37:20,020 --> 03:37:20,300
Okay.

6895
03:37:23,910 --> 03:37:26,030
I- I need- I can get water in my pack.

6896
03:37:26,210 --> 03:37:28,390
But I can't- there's nowhere to safely put the pack down.

6897
03:37:28,730 --> 03:37:29,930
You have to go to that bridge!

6898
03:37:30,270 --> 03:37:31,510
You have to go to that bridge!

6899
03:37:34,810 --> 03:37:36,170
I don't think I made that.

6900
03:37:43,360 --> 03:37:44,080
Oh my god.

6901
03:37:45,000 --> 03:37:45,400
Gamer?

6902
03:37:50,180 --> 03:37:51,000
Oh my gosh!

6903
03:37:51,180 --> 03:37:51,580
She's gaming?

6904
03:37:52,440 --> 03:37:52,920
Oh?

6905
03:37:53,240 --> 03:37:53,420
Oh?

6906
03:37:53,540 --> 03:37:54,760
Don't if I could stop them!

6907
03:37:55,020 --> 03:37:55,160
OK.

6908
03:37:55,700 --> 03:37:56,120
Nice!

6909
03:38:00,260 --> 03:38:00,740
Yes!

6910
03:38:01,360 --> 03:38:02,120
Oh my god!

6911
03:38:02,360 --> 03:38:02,500
Woo!

6912
03:38:03,140 --> 03:38:03,840
She's gaming!

6913
03:38:04,420 --> 03:38:05,740
What if she misses this jump?

6914
03:38:05,840 --> 03:38:06,720
That would be pretty funny.

6915
03:38:06,940 --> 03:38:06,980
Come here!

6916
03:38:07,700 --> 03:38:08,940
I don't see you now!

6917
03:38:10,080 --> 03:38:11,060
Oh my god.

6918
03:38:11,360 --> 03:38:12,740
I can hear birds!

6919
03:38:13,080 --> 03:38:13,280
I can hear birds!

6920
03:38:13,280 --> 03:38:13,740
I can hear birds!

6921
03:38:13,740 --> 03:38:14,060
I can hear birds!

6922
03:38:14,400 --> 03:38:16,220
Oh my god!

6923
03:38:16,320 --> 03:38:16,740
An energy drink!

6924
03:38:16,740 --> 03:38:18,640
it drop the jack bar from there!

6925
03:38:19,200 --> 03:38:20,360
Yeah, drop cannon in it!

6926
03:38:20,640 --> 03:38:21,160
Yeah, drop cannon in it!

6927
03:38:21,160 --> 03:38:22,220
Like here?

6928
03:38:22,760 --> 03:38:25,160
The left side looks like the...

6929
03:38:27,460 --> 03:38:28,600
Behind you, maybe?

6930
03:38:29,040 --> 03:38:31,180
There's a lot of pressure here, holy shit.

6931
03:38:31,480 --> 03:38:32,840
I know, my god!

6932
03:38:33,740 --> 03:38:36,020
Shoot it right in the little balls right there.

6933
03:38:38,100 --> 03:38:40,580
The phallic-looking rock formation?

6934
03:38:40,960 --> 03:38:43,360
You don't have time to think too much because you're hungry.

6935
03:38:43,640 --> 03:38:44,660
Oh, I see the balls!

6936
03:38:44,920 --> 03:38:46,240
I think I get what you mean, yeah.

6937
03:38:47,020 --> 03:38:50,540
Just don't shoot too far because of the length of the rope.

6938
03:38:53,540 --> 03:38:54,780
I was gonna say...

6939
03:38:54,780 --> 03:38:55,680
We're good, we're good.

6940
03:38:55,800 --> 03:38:58,280
I was gonna say, that is a very short rope.

6941
03:38:58,980 --> 03:39:00,160
Right on the balls.

6942
03:39:01,480 --> 03:39:02,980
That's exactly what I was saying.

6943
03:39:03,180 --> 03:39:04,100
See how it's phallic?

6944
03:39:04,180 --> 03:39:05,140
I'm saying this, right?

6945
03:39:05,240 --> 03:39:05,620
You see it?

6946
03:39:05,880 --> 03:39:06,340
Oh gosh.

6947
03:39:06,460 --> 03:39:07,020
Oh gosh.

6948
03:39:07,600 --> 03:39:08,260
Oh gosh.

6949
03:39:09,600 --> 03:39:11,440
Oh my gosh, she's literally right there.

6950
03:39:11,820 --> 03:39:12,820
She's so close.

6951
03:39:13,220 --> 03:39:14,780
I can hear, I can hear freedom.

6952
03:39:15,100 --> 03:39:16,340
I can hear the birds.

6953
03:39:16,540 --> 03:39:18,540
Do you think she'll remember us when she's up there?

6954
03:39:18,680 --> 03:39:19,320
I can see fresh air.

6955
03:39:19,320 --> 03:39:21,260
Oh my god.

6956
03:39:21,480 --> 03:39:23,100
It's so beautiful outside.

6957
03:39:25,200 --> 03:39:25,880
Whoa.

6958
03:39:26,280 --> 03:39:27,620
That would've been so funny.

6959
03:39:29,980 --> 03:39:30,720
I'm scared.

6960
03:39:31,020 --> 03:39:32,200
I'm so scared for her.

6961
03:39:32,680 --> 03:39:34,060
I can't handle this pressure.

6962
03:39:34,920 --> 03:39:36,980
You can't handle this pressure!

6963
03:39:38,600 --> 03:39:40,960
We literally couldn't take it, you jumped the.

6964
03:39:43,220 --> 03:39:46,760
We sacrificed ourselves for our scout master.

6965
03:39:47,520 --> 03:39:49,540
We had to so she could continue falling.

6966
03:39:49,580 --> 03:39:50,480
For our leader.

6967
03:39:52,240 --> 03:39:53,280
Remember us.

6968
03:39:53,860 --> 03:39:55,060
Make sure you have to...

6969
03:39:55,060 --> 03:39:55,720
There's a ledge right above you.

6970
03:39:55,920 --> 03:39:56,360
Yeah there's a ledge.

6971
03:39:56,740 --> 03:39:57,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6972
03:39:57,420 --> 03:39:58,540
Make sure when...

6973
03:39:58,540 --> 03:40:01,680
Make sure to like visit our graves every year.

6974
03:40:09,080 --> 03:40:10,120
You're a pro!

6975
03:40:11,220 --> 03:40:12,400
You beat this game before!

6976
03:40:19,660 --> 03:40:22,740
Oh yeah, don't accidentally use your extra energy.

6977
03:40:24,180 --> 03:40:25,420
Yeah, I'm trying not to.

6978
03:40:26,420 --> 03:40:28,980
Oh my god, it's literally right there.

6979
03:40:30,080 --> 03:40:31,040
Oh my god.

6980
03:40:31,100 --> 03:40:33,280
Oh my god, I see the sky!

6981
03:40:34,320 --> 03:40:35,200
The sun!

6982
03:40:35,800 --> 03:40:36,560
Where's the sun?

6983
03:40:37,020 --> 03:40:38,640
The sun for the campfire.

6984
03:40:39,360 --> 03:40:40,060
Where's the sun?

6985
03:40:40,060 --> 03:40:42,380
Oh my god, it's like the whole world is our campfire.

6986
03:40:49,020 --> 03:40:51,280
This needs like some epic music, I think.

6987
03:40:51,280 --> 03:40:52,880
I know, it does, actually.

6988
03:40:57,840 --> 03:40:59,520
I can't do it!

6989
03:41:00,320 --> 03:41:00,960
I see it!

6990
03:41:01,040 --> 03:41:02,560
I see it!

6991
03:41:05,250 --> 03:41:06,270
Wait, can you...

6992
03:41:06,270 --> 03:41:07,350
Oh my god!

6993
03:41:07,970 --> 03:41:09,050
Oh my god!

6994
03:41:09,510 --> 03:41:10,910
It's literally right there!

6995
03:41:10,910 --> 03:41:15,110
All my days, day man!

6996
03:41:19,590 --> 03:41:22,730
Pop pop pop to the top!

6997
03:41:27,570 --> 03:41:30,330
What time it is, what time is it?

6998
03:41:30,390 --> 03:41:32,050
It's summer time!

6999
03:41:32,670 --> 03:41:34,330
It's our vacation.

7000
03:41:37,630 --> 03:41:39,890
We should drink your energy drink right before.

7001
03:41:43,790 --> 03:41:46,990
Yeah, get a little bit of zoomies before you make it.

7002
03:41:47,430 --> 03:41:48,370
I can't believe it, guys.

7003
03:41:48,530 --> 03:41:51,270
Look, our second try playing Peak and we finished the game.

7004
03:41:51,770 --> 03:41:53,510
We're so good at this, right?

7005
03:41:53,970 --> 03:41:57,870
We're so crazy good at Peak, guys.

7006
03:42:02,350 --> 03:42:08,990
I do think that you guys sacrificing yourselves and having that bravery would get us this win, dude.

7007
03:42:09,570 --> 03:42:10,190
I'm fine.

7008
03:42:10,190 --> 03:42:14,010
I wouldn't have left you if you hadn't jumped.

7009
03:42:14,350 --> 03:42:15,530
Look at us go, man.

7010
03:42:15,610 --> 03:42:16,370
We did it.

7011
03:42:16,550 --> 03:42:17,350
We contributed.

7012
03:42:17,350 --> 03:42:17,990
Yeah, we did it.

7013
03:42:21,010 --> 03:42:25,150
Oh my god, it's lava color, too.

7014
03:42:25,350 --> 03:42:25,850
Look at that.

7015
03:42:27,810 --> 03:42:29,230
Oh, the helicopter!

7016
03:42:29,230 --> 03:42:31,390
Help is you!

7017
03:42:31,630 --> 03:42:33,690
Help is you!

7018
03:42:34,370 --> 03:42:34,750
Yeah!

7019
03:42:35,910 --> 03:42:37,070
We did it!

7020
03:42:38,630 --> 03:42:39,290
Yeah!

7021
03:42:39,750 --> 03:42:41,710
Sir, please, I'm starving to death.

7022
03:42:42,110 --> 03:42:49,230
Eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.

7023
03:42:50,610 --> 03:42:50,750
Yeah!

7024
03:42:52,750 --> 03:42:54,250
Have a friend escape the island.

7025
03:42:54,590 --> 03:42:54,710
Yeah!

7026
03:42:56,370 --> 03:42:57,390
Participation badge!

7027
03:42:58,150 --> 03:42:58,690
Oh, look.

7028
03:42:58,810 --> 03:42:59,810
Me and my friends.

7029
03:43:04,850 --> 03:43:06,350
We did it!

7030
03:43:06,370 --> 03:43:07,110
We did it!

7031
03:43:07,110 --> 03:43:08,550
Wow, we did it!

7032
03:43:09,030 --> 03:43:10,870
Look at all the times we've died.

7033
03:43:11,730 --> 03:43:13,070
Yeah, yeah.

7034
03:43:14,490 --> 03:43:16,550
Where's our badge for dying five times?

7035
03:43:19,740 --> 03:43:21,560
A greater challenge?

7036
03:43:21,760 --> 03:43:22,100
Are you kidding me?

7037
03:43:22,120 --> 03:43:22,900
Oh, I got promoted!

7038
03:43:23,100 --> 03:43:24,260
I got tadpole scout!

7039
03:43:24,260 --> 03:43:24,620
I got promoted!

7040
03:43:24,780 --> 03:43:26,140
Oh my god.

7041
03:43:26,160 --> 03:43:26,640
New hat!

7042
03:43:27,160 --> 03:43:27,300
Oh my god.

7043
03:43:27,300 --> 03:43:27,360
Oh my god.

7044
03:43:27,360 --> 03:43:27,360
New hat!

7045
03:43:27,360 --> 03:43:30,460
Sense and add modifiers that make summoning that's more difficult.

7046
03:43:32,860 --> 03:43:33,320
Goodbye!

7047
03:43:34,160 --> 03:43:34,840
I didn't get to see it.

7048
03:43:36,780 --> 03:43:37,240
Goodbye!

7049
03:43:38,480 --> 03:43:38,940
Goodbye!

7050
03:43:40,980 --> 03:43:41,780
We did it!

7051
03:43:41,780 --> 03:43:42,880
We did it, everyone!

7052
03:43:43,840 --> 03:43:44,100
We did it!

7053
03:43:44,100 --> 03:43:44,140
We did it!

7054
03:43:44,140 --> 03:43:44,200
We did it!

7055
03:43:44,200 --> 03:43:44,760
We clapped Pete!

7056
03:43:44,780 --> 03:43:45,820
We beat Pete!

7057
03:43:57,460 --> 03:43:59,060
Oh my god.

7058
03:44:00,420 --> 03:44:01,620
Guys, we carried.

7059
03:44:02,420 --> 03:44:03,840
We carried, guys.

7060
03:44:04,280 --> 03:44:04,960
We did.

7061
03:44:05,240 --> 03:44:06,160
We did it.

7062
03:44:06,540 --> 03:44:08,380
I never want to fly again.

7063
03:44:08,820 --> 03:44:12,140
The only thing that we would ever go back to a fucking airport after that.

7064
03:44:12,300 --> 03:44:13,220
Let's go, guys.

7065
03:44:13,560 --> 03:44:14,440
Dogpile online move.

7066
03:44:15,460 --> 03:44:16,860
Yeah, you know what?

7067
03:44:17,000 --> 03:44:18,180
I'm happy now.

7068
03:44:18,180 --> 03:44:19,600
Thank you so much.

7069
03:44:25,660 --> 03:44:26,200
Look at that.

7070
03:44:26,280 --> 03:44:27,100
Now I'm happy.

7071
03:44:28,420 --> 03:44:29,700
Now you're happy.

7072
03:44:29,880 --> 03:44:30,160
Yeah.

7073
03:44:31,300 --> 03:44:32,380
I'm happy now.

7074
03:44:34,000 --> 03:44:34,840
Sadness cured.

7075
03:44:35,900 --> 03:44:37,700
Yes, we fixed depression.

7076
03:44:40,320 --> 03:44:42,500
All I have to do is touch grass and lava.

7077
03:44:42,700 --> 03:44:44,620
Well, I believe the snow monster was right.

7078
03:44:44,900 --> 03:44:49,420
And like, climbing a mountain and almost dying and actually dying would fix depression.

7079
03:44:49,760 --> 03:44:50,280
Let's go.

7080
03:44:50,280 --> 03:44:51,480
Let's go outside, clearly.

7081
03:44:51,700 --> 03:44:52,660
Let's go outside, everybody.

7082
03:44:52,660 --> 03:44:55,280
Let's go outside, not aloha.

7083
03:44:55,300 --> 03:44:56,740
Someone super chatted and said Waimu was the great Sherpa.

7084
03:44:58,520 --> 03:45:00,020
It really was Everest.

7085
03:45:00,160 --> 03:45:03,200
She was the... Yeah, she was the Sherpa.

7086
03:45:04,840 --> 03:45:06,280
We were the rich folks.

7087
03:45:06,280 --> 03:45:08,280
Yeah, we were the rich Sherpa.

7088
03:45:10,060 --> 03:45:16,440
We were the rich folks climbing Everest while the Sherpas, like, put us on their back to carry us up the mountain.

7089
03:45:19,840 --> 03:45:21,200
We did it, guys.

7090
03:45:21,560 --> 03:45:22,020
Look at me.

7091
03:45:22,100 --> 03:45:23,740
Now I'm so happy.

7092
03:45:24,120 --> 03:45:25,240
Aloha, everyone.

7093
03:45:26,040 --> 03:45:26,480
Aloha.

7094
03:45:27,340 --> 03:45:29,180
You look like you're ready to go on vacation.

7095
03:45:29,280 --> 03:45:30,560
Yeah, I'm ready to go.

7096
03:45:30,680 --> 03:45:31,760
What are you guys doing?

7097
03:45:31,760 --> 03:45:33,220
Why did you blow it out?

7098
03:45:36,660 --> 03:45:37,260
No.

7099
03:45:41,220 --> 03:45:41,660
No.

7100
03:45:48,820 --> 03:45:49,420
No.

7101
03:45:49,420 --> 03:45:50,480
You're right, Mint.

7102
03:45:50,900 --> 03:45:51,500
You know what?

7103
03:45:51,580 --> 03:45:51,960
You're right.

7104
03:45:52,120 --> 03:45:54,580
We did so good, Mint, for our second time playing.

7105
03:45:54,940 --> 03:45:56,220
Our second time ever playing.

7106
03:45:56,220 --> 03:45:57,820
Yeah, for our second run.

7107
03:45:58,160 --> 03:45:58,280
You did awesome.

7108
03:45:58,420 --> 03:46:00,320
Our second run, we beat the game.

7109
03:46:00,400 --> 03:46:02,240
Yeah, more rocks than ever finish hitting you.

7110
03:46:02,520 --> 03:46:02,600
Yeah.

7111
03:46:03,080 --> 03:46:03,720
So that was really good.

7112
03:46:04,000 --> 03:46:04,700
Let's go.

7113
03:46:04,700 --> 03:46:06,460
We did it all while sleep-depriving.

7114
03:46:06,740 --> 03:46:07,320
Yeah, yeah.

7115
03:46:08,100 --> 03:46:08,640
That's true.

7116
03:46:09,740 --> 03:46:10,360
And Snuffy...

7117
03:46:10,360 --> 03:46:12,280
I'm sleep deprived, but I also have adrenaline.

7118
03:46:12,660 --> 03:46:14,360
So my body is like, what the fuck am I doing?

7119
03:46:15,520 --> 03:46:20,780
And Snuffy for, like, sacrificing herself so she wouldn't worry us.

7120
03:46:21,020 --> 03:46:22,940
She was like, don't worry, guys.

7121
03:46:23,120 --> 03:46:24,420
We all can make it.

7122
03:46:24,680 --> 03:46:26,160
You guys, I was trying to motivate you.

7123
03:46:26,180 --> 03:46:26,720
Yeah, yeah.

7124
03:46:26,860 --> 03:46:27,960
You knew you were...

7125
03:46:27,960 --> 03:46:32,460
You knew you didn't have enough, but you didn't let us know.

7126
03:46:32,460 --> 03:46:34,460
So, you were like, don't worry, guys.

7127
03:46:34,560 --> 03:46:35,820
I'll be right behind you.

7128
03:46:35,940 --> 03:46:37,540
And then you sacrificed yourself.

7129
03:46:37,860 --> 03:46:38,280
Just don't look back.

7130
03:46:42,260 --> 03:46:43,980
Thank you so much, everybody.

7131
03:46:44,160 --> 03:46:44,840
I had an amazing time.

7132
03:46:44,840 --> 03:46:46,740
I had a great time, Sloppy sister.

7133
03:46:47,340 --> 03:46:47,560
Yeah.

7134
03:46:47,860 --> 03:46:49,120
We slopped a lot.

7135
03:46:49,720 --> 03:46:50,040
Let's go.

7136
03:46:50,160 --> 03:46:51,360
Let's put our hands together.

7137
03:46:51,620 --> 03:46:52,260
Are you continuing to stream?

7138
03:46:52,900 --> 03:46:53,820
Snuffy, are you still going?

7139
03:46:53,920 --> 03:46:53,980
I actually did the stream.

7140
03:46:54,120 --> 03:46:54,980
I wasn't...

7141
03:46:54,980 --> 03:46:55,860
You want to stream it?

7142
03:46:55,980 --> 03:46:56,520
Okay, okay.

7143
03:46:56,520 --> 03:46:59,080
Alright, guys, let's put our hands together and do...

7144
03:46:59,080 --> 03:47:00,380
Let's put our hands together.

7145
03:47:00,720 --> 03:47:01,300
I love you guys.

7146
03:47:01,500 --> 03:47:02,280
Thank you so much.

7147
03:47:02,280 --> 03:47:03,740
Yeah, Sloppy's.

7148
03:47:03,740 --> 03:47:05,280
You'll see what's wrong with your arm.

7149
03:47:07,260 --> 03:47:07,820
Sloppy's.

7150
03:47:08,420 --> 03:47:12,940
Yeah, and it's Sloppy's on one, three, two, one.

7151
03:47:13,720 --> 03:47:14,280
Sloppy's.

7152
03:47:15,160 --> 03:47:15,720
Sloppy's.

7153
03:47:17,040 --> 03:47:17,600
Sloppy's.

7154
03:47:19,000 --> 03:47:20,440
Good night, everybody.

7155
03:47:21,220 --> 03:47:22,280
Yeah, GG's, guys.

7156
03:47:23,260 --> 03:47:23,820
GG's.

7157
03:47:23,960 --> 03:47:24,440
Bye-bye.

7158
03:47:25,220 --> 03:47:25,300
Gee-bye.

7159
03:47:26,240 --> 03:47:26,940
Bye-bye.

7160
03:47:27,460 --> 03:47:27,780
Bye-bye.

7161
03:47:27,780 --> 03:47:27,800
Bye-bye.

7162
03:47:27,860 --> 03:47:29,040
Oh, she left the expedition.

7163
03:47:29,260 --> 03:47:29,380
Oh.

7164
03:47:29,740 --> 03:47:30,000
Oh.

7165
03:47:30,180 --> 03:47:30,860
It's just us.

7166
03:47:30,860 --> 03:47:32,680
What's wrong with your arm?

7167
03:47:32,800 --> 03:47:33,440
What do you mean?

7168
03:47:33,600 --> 03:47:34,640
It's my arm!

7169
03:47:35,500 --> 03:47:36,600
What's wrong with it?

7170
03:47:37,400 --> 03:47:38,460
Wait, come look at me.

7171
03:47:38,600 --> 03:47:40,120
Okay, what's wrong with it?

7172
03:47:40,520 --> 03:47:43,980
Ever since I merged into the mountain, things have not been the same.

7173
03:47:44,160 --> 03:47:44,920
Yeah, mine is straight.

7174
03:47:45,560 --> 03:47:46,820
Wait, I don't see it.

7175
03:47:46,940 --> 03:47:47,360
What's wrong?

7176
03:47:47,520 --> 03:47:48,660
Oh, mine's a little curved.

7177
03:47:49,940 --> 03:47:50,660
A little?

7178
03:47:50,900 --> 03:47:51,180
Yeah.

7179
03:47:53,220 --> 03:47:55,560
Wait, no, I think it's whatever's on your screen.

7180
03:47:55,560 --> 03:47:57,520
It looks weird, but mine's like normal.

7181
03:47:58,100 --> 03:47:59,280
Wait, screenshot it.

7182
03:48:00,040 --> 03:48:01,180
Screenshot it, I need to see.

7183
03:48:02,720 --> 03:48:03,160
Aloha.

7184
03:48:05,860 --> 03:48:07,480
This is what it looks like to me.

7185
03:48:07,800 --> 03:48:09,480
Okay, I want to know what this looks like.

7186
03:48:09,680 --> 03:48:10,360
I'm confused.

7187
03:48:11,700 --> 03:48:12,460
Oh my god!

7188
03:48:15,680 --> 03:48:17,500
I think it's a broken arm.

7189
03:48:17,740 --> 03:48:23,060
I think ever since I merged with the mountain, things have not been the same for me.

7190
03:48:25,400 --> 03:48:26,480
Alright, GG's.

7191
03:48:26,500 --> 03:48:26,900
Yeah, I can't do that.

7192
03:48:27,260 --> 03:48:27,760
Okay, GG!

7193
03:48:28,100 --> 03:48:28,520
Bye bye!

7194
03:48:29,380 --> 03:48:29,720
Bye bye!

7195
03:48:29,720 --> 03:48:29,760
Bye bye!

7196
03:48:37,220 --> 03:48:37,480
Fun!

7197
03:48:37,740 --> 03:48:40,340
I have no idea what's wrong with my PC.

7198
03:48:40,680 --> 03:48:41,530
I'm sorry for...

7199
03:48:42,640 --> 03:48:46,560
I'm sorry for... for my PC exploding.

7200
03:48:46,840 --> 03:48:49,240
I have no idea what's going on.

7201
03:48:51,340 --> 03:48:58,120
Most likely... Most likely, I'm gonna take it to the shop tomorrow and figure...

7202
03:48:58,120 --> 03:49:00,260
I think it's just a monitor thing.

7203
03:49:00,460 --> 03:49:01,800
It's been a thing where...

7204
03:49:01,800 --> 03:49:04,440
But my main monitor's never died that much before.

7205
03:49:04,720 --> 03:49:06,300
So like, that was confusing.

7206
03:49:06,300 --> 03:49:08,400
But I think like...

7207
03:49:09,980 --> 03:49:11,280
I think like...

7208
03:49:11,280 --> 03:49:11,480
I think like...

7209
03:49:11,480 --> 03:49:12,520
Yeah, I could not handle...

7210
03:49:13,080 --> 03:49:15,580
Yeah, I could not handle Peak for some reason.

7211
03:49:15,820 --> 03:49:17,400
But I'll take it to the store...

7212
03:49:17,400 --> 03:49:20,260
To the PC store tomorrow and see what happens.

7213
03:49:20,420 --> 03:49:22,380
No, it's been like a thing for my third monitor.

7214
03:49:22,860 --> 03:49:23,160
My...

7215
03:49:23,160 --> 03:49:24,180
I think it's just...

7216
03:49:24,180 --> 03:49:27,100
I have three monitors that might be too intensive in general.

7217
03:49:27,720 --> 03:49:28,200
So...

7218
03:49:28,200 --> 03:49:29,500
I'll go check...

7219
03:49:29,500 --> 03:49:29,920
I might...

7220
03:49:29,920 --> 03:49:32,120
I'm gonna swap my monitors...

7221
03:49:32,120 --> 03:49:32,620
Maybe.

7222
03:49:32,940 --> 03:49:34,000
And see what happens.

7223
03:49:34,000 --> 03:49:35,920
Cause it's been a thing for my...

7224
03:49:35,920 --> 03:49:37,000
Ever since I...

7225
03:49:38,440 --> 03:49:39,000
Um...

7226
03:49:39,000 --> 03:49:40,880
No, it's like been a thing for my...

7227
03:49:40,880 --> 03:49:43,420
Ever since I swapped my third monitor...

7228
03:49:43,420 --> 03:49:45,060
To another really powerful monitor.

7229
03:49:46,540 --> 03:49:47,100
Um...

7230
03:49:47,100 --> 03:49:47,760
Uh...

7231
03:49:47,760 --> 03:49:48,360
I...

7232
03:49:48,360 --> 03:49:49,840
All my cables are...

7233
03:49:49,840 --> 03:49:50,740
Plugged fully.

7234
03:49:51,060 --> 03:49:53,280
No, all my cables are fully plugged in.

7235
03:49:53,460 --> 03:49:54,480
So it can't be that.

7236
03:49:56,160 --> 03:49:57,640
Yeah, it can't be that.

7237
03:49:57,720 --> 03:49:59,800
I'm literally like checking the cables right now.

7238
03:50:00,000 --> 03:50:01,720
But that was fucking weird.

7239
03:50:01,720 --> 03:50:02,640
Hehehehe.

7240
03:50:02,980 --> 03:50:03,500
Hehehehe.

7241
03:50:03,500 --> 03:50:03,540
Hehehehe.

7242
03:50:03,540 --> 03:50:05,120
That sucks though that...

7243
03:50:05,720 --> 03:50:06,040
Uh...

7244
03:50:06,500 --> 03:50:06,760
Uh...

7245
03:50:06,760 --> 03:50:08,640
My stream died a little bit there.

7246
03:50:09,540 --> 03:50:10,060
Hehehehe.

7247
03:50:10,060 --> 03:50:10,380
Hehehehe.

7248
03:50:11,400 --> 03:50:11,920
Hehehehe.

7249
03:50:12,340 --> 03:50:12,860
Uh...

7250
03:50:12,860 --> 03:50:14,400
Yeah, I have like...

7251
03:50:14,400 --> 03:50:15,520
It could be the power...

7252
03:50:15,520 --> 03:50:16,400
Supply, yeah.

7253
03:50:17,880 --> 03:50:18,400
Uh...

7254
03:50:18,400 --> 03:50:19,320
Um...

7255
03:50:19,320 --> 03:50:19,780
But...

7256
03:50:19,780 --> 03:50:20,660
It's okay.

7257
03:50:20,940 --> 03:50:21,520
It was...

7258
03:50:21,520 --> 03:50:22,680
It never had to happen though.

7259
03:50:22,760 --> 03:50:23,840
It was mostly from...

7260
03:50:23,840 --> 03:50:24,660
But...

7261
03:50:24,660 --> 03:50:26,320
I hope like everything else was okay.

7262
03:50:26,380 --> 03:50:28,040
I hope the volume was okay after...

7263
03:50:28,040 --> 03:50:32,780
Um, I rebooted my PC because, like I said, I didn't know if the sound-balancing...

7264
03:50:33,220 --> 03:50:33,900
Oh no.

7265
03:50:34,800 --> 03:50:35,800
Oh, that scared me.

7266
03:50:36,000 --> 03:50:36,620
That scared me.

7267
03:50:36,680 --> 03:50:37,300
I lagged a little.

7268
03:50:41,940 --> 03:50:43,940
Yeah, it might be frying from three monitors.

7269
03:50:44,060 --> 03:50:45,200
It could be that, too.

7270
03:50:45,860 --> 03:50:50,940
Um, it could be frying from three monitors, which could be... which is pretty bad.

7271
03:50:52,820 --> 03:50:54,380
But, was the volume okay?

7272
03:50:55,220 --> 03:50:58,120
I'll set the... yeah, that was crazy.

7273
03:50:58,400 --> 03:51:02,300
I hope it didn't, uh, it didn't mess with the stream too much.

7274
03:51:02,300 --> 03:51:02,820
I hate it.

7275
03:51:02,920 --> 03:51:06,460
I hate when that, you know, there's a good stream everyone's looking forward to.

7276
03:51:07,020 --> 03:51:11,860
And, um, and, you know, having tech issues for that.

7277
03:51:12,160 --> 03:51:17,820
So, I hope it wasn't, like, too intrusive for it, uh, during that time.

7278
03:51:18,000 --> 03:51:19,260
That's all I hope for.

7279
03:51:19,500 --> 03:51:23,120
I'll put the third monitor on 60hz and see if that helps.

7280
03:51:27,100 --> 03:51:32,440
Uh, I'll put the third monitor on 60hz and see if that fixes it.

7281
03:51:33,960 --> 03:51:34,660
Hmm.

7282
03:51:38,820 --> 03:51:40,100
It happens?

7283
03:51:40,460 --> 03:51:40,580
Yeah?

7284
03:51:40,820 --> 03:51:44,640
Was it just, like... it only mostly happened during, uh...

7285
03:51:45,600 --> 03:51:50,200
How... was it just lag... lag... lag... lagging when my PC died there?

7286
03:51:50,200 --> 03:51:51,860
Or was everything else good?

7287
03:51:55,100 --> 03:51:55,660
Chat.

7288
03:51:57,220 --> 03:51:59,920
Was it a little... was it a little choppy throughout it?

7289
03:52:00,060 --> 03:52:00,560
Like, a run?

7290
03:52:04,910 --> 03:52:05,470
Chat?

7291
03:52:05,470 --> 03:52:05,530
What?

7292
03:52:06,070 --> 03:52:07,860
Was it, like... uh...

7293
03:52:08,630 --> 03:52:10,650
It's just, like, laggy... three laggy times.

7294
03:52:10,710 --> 03:52:12,810
Okay, it was just only during when my PC died.

7295
03:52:12,930 --> 03:52:13,150
Okay.

7296
03:52:14,330 --> 03:52:16,090
So... wait, it was really bad?

7297
03:52:16,590 --> 03:52:18,870
Was it really... it was lagging a lot?

7298
03:52:30,270 --> 03:52:31,810
Oh, it just when... oh.

7299
03:52:35,120 --> 03:52:36,440
But I'm so confused.

7300
03:52:37,460 --> 03:52:39,560
Oh, only when the monitor was dying.

7301
03:52:39,760 --> 03:52:40,060
Okay.

7302
03:52:41,540 --> 03:52:42,680
Okay, that was fine.

7303
03:52:42,740 --> 03:52:43,500
Okay, I got worried.

7304
03:52:43,520 --> 03:52:43,960
I was worried.

7305
03:52:44,120 --> 03:52:46,560
Because I saw, like, someone said it was really bad.

7306
03:52:47,120 --> 03:52:50,720
So only when... and it died, like, two... three times.

7307
03:52:50,900 --> 03:52:51,480
So that's fine.

7308
03:52:58,250 --> 03:52:59,070
Oh, okay.

7309
03:53:00,610 --> 03:53:02,530
It was fine for except when it died.

7310
03:53:02,530 --> 03:53:02,870
Okay.

7311
03:53:04,430 --> 03:53:05,730
Okay, that's good to know.

7312
03:53:05,910 --> 03:53:06,630
That's good to know.

7313
03:53:06,770 --> 03:53:07,930
I was worried about that, though.

7314
03:53:07,990 --> 03:53:09,930
But I had a lot of fun.

7315
03:53:10,110 --> 03:53:12,330
I was fucking around a lot, but we still...

7316
03:53:12,870 --> 03:53:13,990
We still won!

7317
03:53:14,310 --> 03:53:14,630
Yay!

7318
03:53:16,850 --> 03:53:21,130
Apparently, I looked really cursed on other people's stream while my PC was dying.

7319
03:53:21,390 --> 03:53:24,390
So that must have been really funny on...

7320
03:53:24,390 --> 03:53:28,690
It must have been funny on other people's stream with what was going on with me.

7321
03:53:32,610 --> 03:53:33,290
Um...

7322
03:53:33,290 --> 03:53:34,170
But...

7323
03:53:34,170 --> 03:53:35,570
Uh, I'm gonna change my...

7324
03:53:35,570 --> 03:53:38,470
I'll change my third monitor...

7325
03:53:38,470 --> 03:53:39,150
Tomorrow.

7326
03:53:39,710 --> 03:53:40,590
Or later today.

7327
03:53:42,410 --> 03:53:43,770
And, um...

7328
03:53:44,450 --> 03:53:45,130
Um...

7329
03:53:45,130 --> 03:53:46,730
And, uh...

7330
03:53:46,730 --> 03:53:49,450
I'll see how it goes.

7331
03:53:49,750 --> 03:53:50,190
If...

7332
03:53:50,190 --> 03:53:53,050
If, like, after I swap my monitor...

7333
03:53:53,050 --> 03:53:55,150
My third monitor out...

7334
03:53:55,150 --> 03:53:55,910
Um...

7335
03:53:55,910 --> 03:53:57,630
After I swap my...

7336
03:53:57,630 --> 03:53:58,510
Third...

7337
03:53:58,510 --> 03:54:00,230
Third monitor out...

7338
03:54:00,230 --> 03:54:00,900
Then I'll...

7339
03:54:01,970 --> 03:54:02,510
Uh...

7340
03:54:02,510 --> 03:54:02,830
I'll...

7341
03:54:02,830 --> 03:54:04,050
And it still does that.

7342
03:54:04,150 --> 03:54:04,790
I'll go...

7343
03:54:04,790 --> 03:54:05,630
Go to the...

7344
03:54:05,630 --> 03:54:07,790
I'll go to, like, the shop to see if they can fix it.

7345
03:54:08,110 --> 03:54:08,470
Yeah.

7346
03:54:09,010 --> 03:54:10,510
I have audio delay now.

7347
03:54:10,670 --> 03:54:11,470
Wait, that's so...

7348
03:54:11,470 --> 03:54:12,270
Wait, wait, what?

7349
03:54:12,470 --> 03:54:12,870
Really?

7350
03:54:12,870 --> 03:54:14,810
My audio is delayed?

7351
03:54:15,190 --> 03:54:16,250
That's so weird.

7352
03:54:16,610 --> 03:54:17,610
Why would it be delayed?

7353
03:54:18,450 --> 03:54:20,190
Ha ha ha ha ha ha...

7354
03:54:20,190 --> 03:54:21,830
Ha ha ha ha...

7355
03:54:22,750 --> 03:54:23,990
Oh my god.

7356
03:54:24,270 --> 03:54:26,570
Like, on my end, it doesn't look delayed at all.

7357
03:54:27,210 --> 03:54:27,590
Yeah.

7358
03:54:28,890 --> 03:54:30,130
Oh, my audio is fine?

7359
03:54:30,290 --> 03:54:30,790
Oh my god.

7360
03:54:31,050 --> 03:54:31,510
Uh...

7361
03:54:31,510 --> 03:54:32,290
People do that?

7362
03:54:32,430 --> 03:54:33,030
Lie on the internet?

7363
03:54:33,390 --> 03:54:34,070
Ha ha ha ha...

7364
03:54:34,070 --> 03:54:34,870
Oh, Nimi!

7365
03:54:35,230 --> 03:54:36,310
Thank you for the raid!

7366
03:54:36,670 --> 03:54:37,690
We actually...

7367
03:54:37,690 --> 03:54:38,810
We just...

7368
03:54:38,810 --> 03:54:39,980
We just finished...

7369
03:54:39,980 --> 03:54:42,780
We just finished beating Peek, so we're just chilling right now.

7370
03:54:43,340 --> 03:54:43,780
Uh...

7371
03:54:43,780 --> 03:54:45,240
But thank you for the raid, Nimi!

7372
03:54:45,300 --> 03:54:46,720
I hope you had fun in Night Ring!

7373
03:54:47,200 --> 03:54:48,920
I saw you three were gonna play Night...

7374
03:54:48,920 --> 03:54:49,860
We're playing Night Ring.

7375
03:54:50,120 --> 03:54:53,160
I don't know what characters you guys picked, but I hope you had a fun time.

7376
03:54:53,340 --> 03:54:54,660
We just beat Peek!

7377
03:54:54,780 --> 03:54:55,580
It was so fun!

7378
03:54:55,660 --> 03:54:57,780
I hope you get to play Peek soon, Nimi.

7379
03:54:57,960 --> 03:54:58,460
It's actually...

7380
03:54:58,460 --> 03:54:59,340
It's such a fun game.

7381
03:55:00,020 --> 03:55:00,500
Um...

7382
03:55:00,500 --> 03:55:02,840
We beat it after, like, two...

7383
03:55:02,840 --> 03:55:03,200
Like...

7384
03:55:03,200 --> 03:55:04,560
In two attempts.

7385
03:55:04,960 --> 03:55:05,440
Like...

7386
03:55:05,440 --> 03:55:06,520
It was definitely...

7387
03:55:06,520 --> 03:55:07,140
Me...

7388
03:55:07,140 --> 03:55:08,980
All of us did so well.

7389
03:55:08,980 --> 03:55:10,780
We all lived and everything.

7390
03:55:11,200 --> 03:55:11,680
Definitely.

7391
03:55:14,640 --> 03:55:16,360
But hello, Napplings!

7392
03:55:16,800 --> 03:55:18,340
I hope you guys have...

7393
03:55:19,240 --> 03:55:19,720
Um...

7394
03:55:19,720 --> 03:55:21,940
A fun time watching Night Ring.

7395
03:55:22,240 --> 03:55:23,260
We're just really...

7396
03:55:23,260 --> 03:55:23,780
Uh...

7397
03:55:23,780 --> 03:55:24,420
Chill today.

7398
03:55:24,680 --> 03:55:26,480
Oh, Nimi was the mage lady.

7399
03:55:26,620 --> 03:55:27,460
Oh, that fits!

7400
03:55:27,660 --> 03:55:28,400
That fits.

7401
03:55:28,780 --> 03:55:30,540
Many, thank you for the one gift of ship.

7402
03:55:30,640 --> 03:55:31,380
Thank you, thank you.

7403
03:55:31,440 --> 03:55:32,140
I can see that.

7404
03:55:32,260 --> 03:55:33,840
Doesn't she play mage in Elder Ring?

7405
03:55:37,240 --> 03:55:38,540
The Royal Wii.

7406
03:55:38,700 --> 03:55:38,840
Hey!

7407
03:55:39,080 --> 03:55:41,260
It was a team game, and we beat it.

7408
03:55:41,660 --> 03:55:42,120
I...

7409
03:55:42,120 --> 03:55:44,260
Mint and I sacrificed ourselves...

7410
03:55:44,260 --> 03:55:45,840
For that greater good.

7411
03:55:46,160 --> 03:55:48,980
If Mint and I didn't sacrifice ourselves...

7412
03:55:48,980 --> 03:55:50,220
Lamu would not...

7413
03:55:50,220 --> 03:55:51,060
Would have got slapped.

7414
03:55:51,320 --> 03:55:51,580
Okay?

7415
03:55:51,800 --> 03:55:54,000
She would have got slapped by the Scoutmaster.

7416
03:55:59,320 --> 03:55:59,880
That's right.

7417
03:56:01,420 --> 03:56:01,980
So, we...

7418
03:56:02,480 --> 03:56:03,640
We did it all.

7419
03:56:06,760 --> 03:56:08,040
Kabuto, thank you for the super chat.

7420
03:56:08,180 --> 03:56:09,040
I was so brave.

7421
03:56:09,200 --> 03:56:09,560
I know.

7422
03:56:11,960 --> 03:56:13,180
Kabuto, thank you for the super chat.

7423
03:56:13,260 --> 03:56:14,000
Thank you, thank you.

7424
03:56:14,100 --> 03:56:15,060
I'll head back to work now.

7425
03:56:15,180 --> 03:56:17,000
It's a shame I'm gonna miss the rest of this peak gameplay.

7426
03:56:17,340 --> 03:56:18,240
Thank you for the super chat.

7427
03:56:18,320 --> 03:56:18,940
Thank you, thank you.

7428
03:56:19,000 --> 03:56:20,760
Mr. Broken Bond, thank you for the super chat.

7429
03:56:20,840 --> 03:56:21,480
Thank you, thank you.

7430
03:56:21,580 --> 03:56:22,200
It's peak.

7431
03:56:22,340 --> 03:56:23,540
Woof, thank you for the super chat.

7432
03:56:23,540 --> 03:56:24,360
Thank you.

7433
03:56:24,440 --> 03:56:25,040
Broken bun.

7434
03:56:25,200 --> 03:56:25,920
Thank you for the super chat.

7435
03:56:26,040 --> 03:56:26,620
Thank you.

7436
03:56:26,800 --> 03:56:30,940
This was the sloppy sister corporate retreat from the fast food restaurant.

7437
03:56:31,380 --> 03:56:32,340
Thank you for the super chat.

7438
03:56:32,440 --> 03:56:32,740
Thank you.

7439
03:56:32,880 --> 03:56:33,540
Thank you.

7440
03:56:33,780 --> 03:56:35,380
At least I ate my lollipop.

7441
03:56:35,520 --> 03:56:37,160
I know I kept getting the lollipop.

7442
03:56:37,260 --> 03:56:38,000
Never punished.

7443
03:56:41,040 --> 03:56:43,520
Never punished from eating the lollipops.

7444
03:56:43,520 --> 03:56:44,960
Uh, next C.

7445
03:56:45,060 --> 03:56:45,840
Thank you, this super chat.

7446
03:56:45,940 --> 03:56:46,520
Thank you, thank you.

7447
03:56:46,720 --> 03:56:49,080
It might just be the monitor cable not being fully connected.

7448
03:56:49,420 --> 03:56:52,580
It tries to replace the cable or swapping it out with another monitor to test it.

7449
03:56:52,660 --> 03:56:53,320
Thank you, this super chat.

7450
03:56:53,400 --> 03:56:53,820
Thank you, thank you.

7451
03:56:53,940 --> 03:56:55,420
Right now, my monitor's not dying.

7452
03:56:56,540 --> 03:56:57,720
Now, now it's fine.

7453
03:56:57,980 --> 03:57:02,220
I don't know what it was about Peak that was causing my main monitor to freak out.

7454
03:57:02,360 --> 03:57:05,540
But, like, right now, I haven't had any issues at the moment.

7455
03:57:05,800 --> 03:57:07,460
So, it's very weird.

7456
03:57:07,600 --> 03:57:08,220
It's very weird.

7457
03:57:08,700 --> 03:57:11,500
Uh, never punished, yeah.

7458
03:57:15,020 --> 03:57:18,020
Um, maybe it was FPS?

7459
03:57:18,600 --> 03:57:23,160
Uh, I mean, I did low- I kept lowering it, too.

7460
03:57:23,720 --> 03:57:25,600
Um, it was too peak.

7461
03:57:25,660 --> 03:57:26,380
That was fun, though.

7462
03:57:26,440 --> 03:57:31,260
I understand why a lot of people, like, have been spamming peak.

7463
03:57:31,720 --> 03:57:35,720
Um, uh, have been spamming peak a lot.

7464
03:57:35,900 --> 03:57:42,860
Because I feel like since the map changes every day, um, it changes every day.

7465
03:57:43,400 --> 03:57:52,760
And, um, um, and with different people, you can have different, like, chemistry and combinations and stuff for it.

7466
03:57:53,020 --> 03:57:55,480
But, like, I don't think I can, like, play it.

7467
03:57:55,940 --> 03:57:59,700
For me, after beating the game, I don't know- I don't know.

7468
03:57:59,920 --> 03:58:01,920
Maybe I could play, like, once or twice more.

7469
03:58:01,920 --> 03:58:06,500
But I don't know if I could, like, play a lot more of that- of the game, because after beating it, you know?

7470
03:58:08,020 --> 03:58:09,620
Um, it was very fun to watch.

7471
03:58:09,740 --> 03:58:11,460
Yeah, it was very fun to play, too.

7472
03:58:11,460 --> 03:58:14,500
It was definitely really fun to play with the Sloppy Sisters.

7473
03:58:15,360 --> 03:58:22,840
Uh, but yeah, I think it was good that, you know, Min and I didn't spoil ourselves with, like, Modric- like, with, like, playing it beforehand.

7474
03:58:23,580 --> 03:58:31,340
And, um, um, and, you know, um, having this as our first experience, too.

7475
03:58:31,540 --> 03:58:40,640
I mean, it did help a lot that Lime was a fucking gamer when it- like, she's the most competent out of all of us when it comes to, like, games that require your brain.

7476
03:58:40,900 --> 03:58:45,200
She is definitely the most competent person out of all of us.

7477
03:58:46,640 --> 03:58:50,960
Yeah, it was a good combination of blind players and experienced players.

7478
03:58:51,180 --> 03:58:51,340
Yeah.

7479
03:58:52,380 --> 03:58:53,720
Um, yeah, I had a lot of fun.

7480
03:58:53,800 --> 03:58:54,140
I'm glad.

7481
03:58:54,800 --> 03:58:55,240
Mm-hmm.

7482
03:58:55,760 --> 03:59:01,560
But I'm definitely gonna- yeah, I'm gonna try and swap the monitors tonight and see if anything changes.

7483
03:59:01,920 --> 03:59:06,140
Because I had no issues yesterday when we were streaming, uh, Eldering.

7484
03:59:07,560 --> 03:59:13,880
So, um, so it was very weird, um, that Peek was the one that decided to kill my PC.

7485
03:59:14,100 --> 03:59:15,700
I was at PC issues, too.

7486
03:59:15,880 --> 03:59:16,700
I don't know why.

7487
03:59:16,820 --> 03:59:20,180
I don't know why, like, I have, like, I actually have the PC curse.

7488
03:59:20,440 --> 03:59:23,380
I- every PC I touch fucking explodes in the end.

7489
03:59:23,680 --> 03:59:28,580
Uh, I have no idea how this happens.

7490
03:59:28,580 --> 03:59:36,340
Every PC, no matter how fucking good the PC is, um, it, like, there's something, something happens.

7491
03:59:42,300 --> 03:59:43,100
Something happens.

7492
03:59:44,820 --> 03:59:46,980
Um, I didn't move my cables, though.

7493
03:59:47,200 --> 03:59:49,160
I- I didn't touch anything regarding my cables.

7494
03:59:49,680 --> 03:59:51,360
Uh, Seijen, thank you for the super sticker.

7495
03:59:51,480 --> 03:59:52,280
Thank you, thank you.

7496
03:59:52,520 --> 03:59:56,260
And, uh, Matt, uh, thank you for the various super stickers.

7497
03:59:57,920 --> 03:59:58,260
Also...

7498
03:59:58,260 --> 03:59:59,920
Thank you again for the Akasupa Sajun!

7499
04:00:00,020 --> 04:00:00,840
Thank you, thank you!

7500
04:00:00,980 --> 04:00:02,960
Alright Dragoons, hold out your hands.

7501
04:00:05,020 --> 04:00:05,360
Um...

7502
04:00:05,860 --> 04:00:06,200
SimpleMinded!

7503
04:00:06,220 --> 04:00:07,360
Thank you for the super chat.

7504
04:00:07,500 --> 04:00:08,400
Thank you, thank you!

7505
04:00:09,300 --> 04:00:14,320
Doki, your character reminds me of the Popeye, the Sailor Man...

7506
04:00:14,320 --> 04:00:15,400
And I'm angry!

7507
04:00:16,000 --> 04:00:16,340
Zonerman!

7508
04:00:16,480 --> 04:00:17,220
Thank you for the super chat!

7509
04:00:17,320 --> 04:00:17,800
Thank you, thank you.

7510
04:00:17,900 --> 04:00:19,600
Add sloppy sisters to the description.

7511
04:00:20,060 --> 04:00:21,720
Oh, I mean, I could in the future.

7512
04:00:22,200 --> 04:00:23,920
Thank you for the Super Chat, thank you, thank you.

7513
04:00:23,940 --> 04:00:33,260
I might make a playlist every time for all the SloppySister collabs, that helps too.

7514
04:00:34,000 --> 04:00:36,060
Thank you for the Super Chat with us.

7515
04:00:36,060 --> 04:00:36,860
Thank you, thank you.

7516
04:00:39,680 --> 04:00:42,460
Sage, thank you for the Super Chat, thank you, thank you.

7517
04:00:43,420 --> 04:00:47,780
CPU 100% and Dragoon, hold a line.

7518
04:00:47,780 --> 04:00:52,100
And, um, guys, thank you for the super... Thank you for the super... Thank you.

7519
04:00:52,260 --> 04:00:53,380
This game is so metal.

7520
04:00:53,380 --> 04:00:54,320
You die in game.

7521
04:00:54,440 --> 04:00:55,940
You die in real life.

7522
04:00:56,100 --> 04:00:57,480
It was so freaky.

7523
04:00:57,800 --> 04:01:06,740
Um, because, like, when my main monitor died, um, everything, like, slowed down.

7524
04:01:07,300 --> 04:01:14,800
And then, like, when it fully died, I knew, like, oh, I have to force shut my PC.

7525
04:01:15,780 --> 04:01:21,680
Um, all I heard was just meant laughing on repeat over and over and over again.

7526
04:01:21,680 --> 04:01:24,120
And I was like, oh my god, my PC is haunted.

7527
04:01:24,300 --> 04:01:26,280
I am truly haunted right now.

7528
04:01:30,040 --> 04:01:34,040
And then that's when I, like, fully shut down my PC.

7529
04:01:34,380 --> 04:01:36,160
Um, and came back.

7530
04:01:38,240 --> 04:01:38,760
Um...

7531
04:01:38,760 --> 04:01:39,140
No name.

7532
04:01:39,260 --> 04:01:40,240
Thank you for the super chat thing.

7533
04:01:40,360 --> 04:01:40,820
And thank you.

7534
04:01:41,040 --> 04:01:42,860
Uh, from ghost to toast.

7535
04:01:43,900 --> 04:01:44,420
Uh...

7536
04:01:44,940 --> 04:01:46,220
Kabuto, thank you for the super chat.

7537
04:01:46,300 --> 04:01:46,500
Thank you.

7538
04:01:46,580 --> 04:01:46,940
Thank you.

7539
04:01:47,140 --> 04:01:48,180
Hey, I'm just catching a stream.

7540
04:01:48,340 --> 04:01:49,640
I can tell this is going to be peak.

7541
04:01:49,780 --> 04:01:50,760
Thank you again for the super chat.

7542
04:01:50,860 --> 04:01:51,020
Thank you.

7543
04:01:51,120 --> 04:01:51,360
Thank you.

7544
04:01:51,440 --> 04:01:52,800
Sejan, thank you for the super sticker.

7545
04:01:53,020 --> 04:01:53,240
Thank you.

7546
04:01:53,340 --> 04:01:53,840
Thank you.

7547
04:01:55,220 --> 04:01:55,780
Oh, yeah.

7548
04:01:56,100 --> 04:01:56,460
Oh, yeah.

7549
04:01:56,680 --> 04:01:57,000
Tomorrow.

7550
04:01:57,280 --> 04:01:58,040
I think it's tomorrow.

7551
04:01:58,820 --> 04:02:00,520
I think it's either Saturday or Sunday.

7552
04:02:01,220 --> 04:02:05,380
But tomorrow, I'll be on my very first podcast.

7553
04:02:06,560 --> 04:02:08,460
Well, I did already do the podcast.

7554
04:02:08,520 --> 04:02:14,100
But I'll be in my very first podcast that was hosted.

7555
04:02:14,420 --> 04:02:16,320
By Lily Pichu.

7556
04:02:16,600 --> 04:02:17,940
Lily Pichu.

7557
04:02:18,340 --> 04:02:24,340
And I think the podcast is... It's... Whose channel?

7558
04:02:24,520 --> 04:02:25,420
What channel is it?

7559
04:02:26,480 --> 04:02:28,660
I need to grab it real quick.

7560
04:02:29,280 --> 04:02:38,080
But she has a podcast series called Sweet and Sour with Lily Pichu and Pokimane.

7561
04:02:38,680 --> 04:02:44,400
Pokimane's not there, but I'm a guest with Lily Pichu on Lily Pichu's podcast.

7562
04:02:44,420 --> 04:02:49,500
I think it's gonna be out tomorrow on her... on the channel.

7563
04:02:49,780 --> 04:02:51,140
It's a Sweet and Sour podcast.

7564
04:02:51,440 --> 04:02:51,560
Yeah.

7565
04:02:52,960 --> 04:02:56,060
And it's a VTuber dedicated episode.

7566
04:02:56,060 --> 04:03:02,060
And this is my very first... It's my very first time doing a podcast.

7567
04:03:02,080 --> 04:03:06,840
I've never done a podcast before, but it's my very first time.

7568
04:03:07,360 --> 04:03:10,200
And I think it's gonna be out tomorrow.

7569
04:03:10,620 --> 04:03:12,220
That's what I was told.

7570
04:03:12,540 --> 04:03:14,180
Unless it's next week, but whatever.

7571
04:03:14,420 --> 04:03:17,180
At least, like, they're knowing it the earliest better, right?

7572
04:03:23,580 --> 04:03:24,040
And...

7573
04:03:25,320 --> 04:03:27,820
To, like, you know, commemorate...

7574
04:03:27,820 --> 04:03:30,600
This being my very first podcast...

7575
04:03:31,440 --> 04:03:33,960
Lily and I are gonna do a collab next week.

7576
04:03:33,960 --> 04:03:37,600
Um, cause we do have, like, another collab with, uh...

7577
04:03:37,600 --> 04:03:41,080
With, uh, Mimi and Doobie and Mint next week, too.

7578
04:03:41,320 --> 04:03:42,040
On Friday.

7579
04:03:42,740 --> 04:03:45,140
Um, where we're gonna do part two of Missionary Zero.

7580
04:03:45,480 --> 04:03:47,820
But, I haven't... we haven't figured out a date yet.

7581
04:03:48,060 --> 04:03:50,120
But, we're also gonna have another...

7582
04:03:50,120 --> 04:03:52,920
Another collab with Lily Pichu next week.

7583
04:03:52,940 --> 04:03:55,720
Where we're gonna be drunk and drawing characters from memory.

7584
04:03:55,720 --> 04:03:58,320
We don't know if we're gonna do Pokemon or random characters.

7585
04:03:58,620 --> 04:04:00,860
Cause I feel like random characters would be pretty funny.

7586
04:04:01,060 --> 04:04:01,500
You know?

7587
04:04:01,640 --> 04:04:03,700
But, it also has to be characters that we both know.

7588
04:04:04,220 --> 04:04:04,580
Um...

7589
04:04:04,580 --> 04:04:05,980
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

7590
04:04:05,980 --> 04:04:08,320
Um, so, we're gonna...

7591
04:04:08,320 --> 04:04:13,380
We're gonna do drunk drawing characters from memory together.

7592
04:04:15,240 --> 04:04:15,740
Um...

7593
04:04:15,740 --> 04:04:17,740
Uh, with Lily Pichu.

7594
04:04:17,960 --> 04:04:19,100
Not sure the date yet.

7595
04:04:19,740 --> 04:04:20,520
So, yeah.

7596
04:04:21,500 --> 04:04:22,000
Um...

7597
04:04:22,000 --> 04:04:25,040
And then, the week after...

7598
04:04:25,040 --> 04:04:26,960
I think I have another collab the week.

7599
04:04:27,060 --> 04:04:28,140
Well, I know I've been...

7600
04:04:28,140 --> 04:04:29,960
I've been trying to schedule collabs in advance.

7601
04:04:31,300 --> 04:04:31,800
Um...

7602
04:04:31,800 --> 04:04:32,360
Let me see.

7603
04:04:32,900 --> 04:04:34,480
Do I have a collab next week?

7604
04:04:34,700 --> 04:04:34,800
Oh, no.

7605
04:04:35,120 --> 04:04:35,480
Oh, wait.

7606
04:04:35,600 --> 04:04:35,880
I...

7607
04:04:35,880 --> 04:04:36,760
I...

7608
04:04:36,760 --> 04:04:39,340
Technically, I don't have a collab...

7609
04:04:39,340 --> 04:04:40,000
Hmm...

7610
04:04:40,500 --> 04:04:41,280
I think...

7611
04:04:41,280 --> 04:04:42,380
I don't remember if I...

7612
04:04:42,380 --> 04:04:43,120
I don't remember.

7613
04:04:43,260 --> 04:04:45,080
I think I have a collab on...

7614
04:04:45,080 --> 04:04:46,020
The week...

7615
04:04:46,020 --> 04:04:47,020
The week after that?

7616
04:04:48,760 --> 04:04:50,300
Cause I know I've been scheduling...

7617
04:04:50,300 --> 04:04:50,620
Cause...

7618
04:04:50,620 --> 04:04:51,120
Oh, no.

7619
04:04:51,280 --> 04:04:51,400
No.

7620
04:04:51,560 --> 04:04:51,620
No.

7621
04:04:51,860 --> 04:04:53,240
I have a...

7622
04:04:53,720 --> 04:04:54,800
I have a...

7623
04:04:54,800 --> 04:04:56,600
Tournament thing next week.

7624
04:04:56,800 --> 04:04:57,160
The week.

7625
04:04:57,300 --> 04:04:57,960
No, not next week.

7626
04:04:57,980 --> 04:04:58,200
Sorry.

7627
04:04:58,380 --> 04:05:01,600
I have a tournament in two weeks for a new game that's coming out.

7628
04:05:01,900 --> 04:05:02,340
Um...

7629
04:05:02,340 --> 04:05:04,000
That I'm gonna be sponsored for.

7630
04:05:04,140 --> 04:05:05,560
So, that's gonna be what that is.

7631
04:05:05,560 --> 04:05:06,340
You guys are like, whoa!

7632
04:05:06,600 --> 04:05:06,920
Tournament?

7633
04:05:07,220 --> 04:05:08,260
Uh, I got invited.

7634
04:05:08,980 --> 04:05:09,500
Um...

7635
04:05:09,500 --> 04:05:11,040
You guys might have seen it already.

7636
04:05:11,740 --> 04:05:12,260
Um...

7637
04:05:12,260 --> 04:05:13,700
But apparently there's a new...

7638
04:05:14,400 --> 04:05:15,680
Game coming out.

7639
04:05:15,800 --> 04:05:16,680
A new FPS...

7640
04:05:16,680 --> 04:05:17,400
I said FPS...

7641
04:05:17,400 --> 04:05:21,020
It's a new third-person shooter game that's coming out.

7642
04:05:21,040 --> 04:05:23,320
That's based off of anime characters.

7643
04:05:23,320 --> 04:05:25,240
And, um...

7644
04:05:25,240 --> 04:05:30,820
And I got invited by the devs to a tournament as a sponsor.

7645
04:05:31,200 --> 04:05:31,860
Uh...

7646
04:05:31,860 --> 04:05:33,360
So I get paid to be there.

7647
04:05:33,580 --> 04:05:34,020
So, yay!

7648
04:05:38,400 --> 04:05:40,920
I love being paid.

7649
04:05:41,620 --> 04:05:44,320
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

7650
04:05:45,700 --> 04:05:46,140
Um...

7651
04:05:46,140 --> 04:05:46,900
And that's...

7652
04:05:46,900 --> 04:05:47,420
I didn't put...

7653
04:05:47,420 --> 04:05:48,580
I didn't organize a sponsor.

7654
04:05:48,820 --> 04:05:49,200
I didn't...

7655
04:05:49,200 --> 04:05:50,380
Sorry, I didn't organize a collab there.

7656
04:05:50,420 --> 04:05:53,200
Because there's already gonna be a lot of stuff going on.

7657
04:05:54,040 --> 04:05:54,480
Um...

7658
04:05:54,480 --> 04:06:00,240
But some of you guys might have seen it already because I saw someone on Twitter at me to sign up for the tournament.

7659
04:06:00,520 --> 04:06:03,540
But little did they know, I was already invited by the devs.

7660
04:06:07,680 --> 04:06:11,220
Little do they know, I was already invited.

7661
04:06:13,500 --> 04:06:16,200
I have no idea who my teammates are.

7662
04:06:16,540 --> 04:06:18,040
What team I'm in.

7663
04:06:21,400 --> 04:06:24,860
As long as I'm there and I get paid.

7664
04:06:25,280 --> 04:06:27,120
That's all that matters.

7665
04:06:34,420 --> 04:06:36,260
Next C, thank you for the super chat.

7666
04:06:36,380 --> 04:06:37,280
Thank you, thank you.

7667
04:06:37,540 --> 04:06:39,140
Playlist would be cool.

7668
04:06:39,420 --> 04:06:41,060
Sloppy Sisters is truly peak.

7669
04:06:41,240 --> 04:06:42,440
Well, again, thank you for the super chat.

7670
04:06:42,540 --> 04:06:43,580
Thank you, thank you.

7671
04:06:44,460 --> 04:06:44,980
Yay!

7672
04:06:46,020 --> 04:06:47,380
I love networking.

7673
04:06:47,620 --> 04:06:48,320
Oh, is it networking?

7674
04:06:49,920 --> 04:06:54,840
I guess it is networking.

7675
04:06:55,260 --> 04:07:00,700
Because I've been building some really good relationships with a lot of companies and stuff.

7676
04:07:00,980 --> 04:07:06,040
And a lot of companies are coming back to me for sponsors and stuff like that.

7677
04:07:06,140 --> 04:07:08,940
Because I guess I do well on my sponsors.

7678
04:07:08,940 --> 04:07:13,740
So, a lot of companies are coming back to me and being like, Oh, I want to work with you again.

7679
04:07:14,040 --> 04:07:15,740
And work with like...

7680
04:07:15,740 --> 04:07:18,500
For like this new game and stuff like that.

7681
04:07:18,620 --> 04:07:19,300
Which is nice.

7682
04:07:19,520 --> 04:07:20,260
It's really nice.

7683
04:07:20,440 --> 04:07:22,160
Because like...

7684
04:07:22,160 --> 04:07:26,020
In the past, I never had some...

7685
04:07:26,020 --> 04:07:29,240
Like a lot of these types of opportunities before.

7686
04:07:30,040 --> 04:07:32,680
So, it's like really nice in general.

7687
04:07:33,380 --> 04:07:33,940
Um...

7688
04:07:33,940 --> 04:07:34,840
Because like...

7689
04:07:34,840 --> 04:07:35,260
Some...

7690
04:07:35,260 --> 04:07:39,860
I remember in the past, people thought that I reject offers or like...

7691
04:07:39,860 --> 04:07:41,300
Sponsors in the past.

7692
04:07:41,540 --> 04:07:42,100
But like...

7693
04:07:42,100 --> 04:07:44,240
Why the fuck would I reject free money?

7694
04:07:45,360 --> 04:07:45,920
Like...

7695
04:07:47,460 --> 04:07:48,020
Like...

7696
04:07:48,020 --> 04:07:48,500
Like...

7697
04:07:48,500 --> 04:07:49,260
I'm like...

7698
04:07:49,260 --> 04:07:51,240
It's like one hour of my time.

7699
04:07:51,380 --> 04:07:52,800
Like, why would I say no?

7700
04:07:53,800 --> 04:07:54,360
Like...

7701
04:07:54,360 --> 04:07:55,060
Like...

7702
04:07:56,860 --> 04:07:57,300
Why...

7703
04:07:57,300 --> 04:08:00,780
I remember in the past, people were like, Oh, I wonder why she doesn't like...

7704
04:08:00,780 --> 04:08:01,700
You know...

7705
04:08:01,700 --> 04:08:02,280
Um...

7706
04:08:02,280 --> 04:08:02,920
Wonder why...

7707
04:08:02,920 --> 04:08:03,220
Like...

7708
04:08:03,220 --> 04:08:04,620
Why doesn't she do the sponsor?

7709
04:08:04,880 --> 04:08:05,720
Like, why...

7710
04:08:05,720 --> 04:08:07,000
Oh, I wasn't...

7711
04:08:07,000 --> 04:08:07,240
Like...

7712
04:08:07,240 --> 04:08:08,320
Oh, she must have said no.

7713
04:08:08,420 --> 04:08:08,760
Or something.

7714
04:08:08,880 --> 04:08:09,680
Or like...

7715
04:08:09,680 --> 04:08:11,180
Or something like that.

7716
04:08:11,200 --> 04:08:12,580
I'm like, why would I say no?

7717
04:08:12,880 --> 04:08:13,320
Like...

7718
04:08:13,320 --> 04:08:13,960
Why...

7719
04:08:13,960 --> 04:08:14,760
Hello?

7720
04:08:22,300 --> 04:08:24,200
So, it's really nice, you know.

7721
04:08:24,300 --> 04:08:33,900
It's really nice that companies like me and, like, companies, you know, trust me enough to, like, you know, show their stuff.

7722
04:08:34,160 --> 04:08:39,440

Thank you, thank you.

7738
04:09:06,640 --> 04:09:08,180
Doki loves money and I love her.

7739
04:09:08,300 --> 04:09:09,000
Thank you to the super chat.

7740
04:09:09,120 --> 04:09:09,680
Thank you, thank you.

7741
04:09:09,680 --> 04:09:17,960
Well, I like just being able to have enough money to invest back into my channel and do lots of fun things and stuff like that.

7742
04:09:19,920 --> 04:09:21,620
And all that stuff.

7743
04:09:21,880 --> 04:09:27,880
So, you know, it's nice to be able to... What can I... Oh, someone's like, what can I buy?

7744
04:09:28,040 --> 04:09:29,980
You can buy this!

7745
04:09:30,300 --> 04:09:30,700
Whoa!

7746
04:09:31,420 --> 04:09:31,960
Look at that!

7747
04:09:32,020 --> 04:09:33,320
My birthday bundle!

7748
04:09:33,960 --> 04:09:34,880
Look at that!

7749
04:09:35,180 --> 04:09:35,680
Whoa!

7750
04:09:36,280 --> 04:09:37,640
So many cool things!

7751
04:09:37,880 --> 04:09:38,680
Oh, shit, not that.

7752
04:09:41,120 --> 04:09:42,260
Alright, here we go.

7753
04:09:42,340 --> 04:09:42,960
Let's put it here.

7754
04:09:45,240 --> 04:09:51,580
Um... Um... I do want to move, though, this year.

7755
04:09:51,820 --> 04:09:54,040
I want to move to a bigger space.

7756
04:09:54,900 --> 04:09:56,640
Um... And a better office.

7757
04:09:56,860 --> 04:09:57,860
I hate this office.

7758
04:09:58,180 --> 04:10:02,180
I... I really hate this office.

7759
04:10:02,440 --> 04:10:08,200
I want to... I need to, like, move to, like, a bigger place, too.

7760
04:10:08,200 --> 04:10:10,420
That's, like, all I really want.

7761
04:10:10,440 --> 04:10:16,720
So I can have, like, um... A better office for my PCs, you know, my setup and everything.

7762
04:10:17,180 --> 04:10:22,780
And also, uh... No, I'm gonna stay... I'm gonna stay in the same city.

7763
04:10:23,120 --> 04:10:25,380
I might just... I'm gonna stay in the same city.

7764
04:10:25,960 --> 04:10:29,360
Um... Just cause, like, I don't want to make a big, big move.

7765
04:10:30,740 --> 04:10:42,960
Um... And I didn't want to make a too big a move just so, like, my... Uh... I can still, like, uh... Do the things I want to do without having to make too much of a big hiatus.

7766
04:10:42,960 --> 04:10:54,340
I think if... I think, for me, I told myself, like, the day you can, like, actually relax and chill will be after you hit a million subscribers.

7767
04:10:54,720 --> 04:11:01,900
And then after you hit... After I hit a million subscribers, I'll, like, focus on myself more.

7768
04:11:02,180 --> 04:11:03,340
That's what I told myself.

7769
04:11:03,340 --> 04:11:10,340
So, so... I... I had, like, a midlife crisis to my manager last week.

7770
04:11:10,600 --> 04:11:12,980
Cause I was, like... Oh my gosh.

7771
04:11:13,200 --> 04:11:16,840
Like... I mean, I spent so much time just, like, inside my room.

7772
04:11:18,060 --> 04:11:21,360
Um... Like, should I have been, like... Do I... Cause, like... Okay.

7773
04:11:21,520 --> 04:11:22,660
Cause, like, I was thinking, like...

7774
04:11:22,660 --> 04:11:30,680
So many people are just moving to Japan or, like... Like, I don't know... Moving to Japan or moving to a new place or whatever.

7775
04:11:30,680 --> 04:11:31,560
Like, LA.

7776
04:11:31,700 --> 04:11:33,840
Where all the content creators are.

7777
04:11:34,260 --> 04:11:37,280
Or, like... Um... I know, like, mid... Okay.

7778
04:11:37,440 --> 04:11:38,840
Midlife streamer crisis.

7779
04:11:39,140 --> 04:11:43,460
This is, like... You know when you're streaming for so long and you have a midlife streamer crisis?

7780
04:11:43,720 --> 04:11:44,440
That was me.

7781
04:11:44,520 --> 04:11:46,300
I was having a midlife streamer crisis.

7782
04:11:46,780 --> 04:11:47,220
Um...

7783
04:11:47,760 --> 04:11:51,280
I was, like... People are, like, experiencing the world.

7784
04:11:53,480 --> 04:11:54,000
Um...

7785
04:11:54,000 --> 04:11:56,500
Everyone is, like, experiencing the world.

7786
04:11:56,960 --> 04:11:59,820
Enjoying, like, new experiences and stuff like that.

7787
04:11:59,820 --> 04:12:01,440
And I was, like, oh my god.

7788
04:12:01,620 --> 04:12:07,060
Like, should I... Like... Should I, like... Try and do that, too?

7789
04:12:07,300 --> 04:12:10,800
Like, maybe, like, you know... I don't know if... I don't know.

7790
04:12:10,880 --> 04:12:11,180
I'm, like...

7791
04:12:11,180 --> 04:12:12,400
What do I do if I move to Japan?

7792
04:12:12,600 --> 04:12:14,440
I... Mostly, I just eat a lot.

7793
04:12:14,680 --> 04:12:17,100
Cause, like, I'll just explore the food market area.

7794
04:12:17,280 --> 04:12:19,760
Because, like... That's, like, the only thing I could think of.

7795
04:12:19,760 --> 04:12:22,320
Like, just, like, you know, go around, like, different cafes.

7796
04:12:22,760 --> 04:12:24,920
Or, like... Um...

7797
04:12:24,920 --> 04:12:28,060
Or, like, just explore the food around Japan.

7798
04:12:28,060 --> 04:12:31,100
You know, like, those fucking food Japan bloggers?

7799
04:12:32,180 --> 04:12:34,400
That... There's one that I always watch.

7800
04:12:34,680 --> 04:12:37,720
The Japan Eats... Is that his YouTube channel?

7801
04:12:37,960 --> 04:12:40,080
His shorts always pops up and it's so interesting.

7802
04:12:40,080 --> 04:12:42,380
Also, see, my main mod has not died once.

7803
04:12:42,600 --> 04:12:46,080
It has... Something about... Something about Peak has been...

7804
04:12:46,820 --> 04:12:51,780
Something about Peak is, like, had... Was fucking up my... My... PC.

7805
04:12:52,000 --> 04:12:53,280
And I don't know what it was.

7806
04:12:53,420 --> 04:12:53,920
Okay, let's see.

7807
04:12:55,200 --> 04:12:56,240
Yeah, Japan Eats.

7808
04:12:56,240 --> 04:12:57,360
I love Japan Eats.

7809
04:12:57,440 --> 04:12:58,240
I love Japan Eats.

7810
04:12:58,320 --> 04:13:02,680
And I was thinking, like, I could, like... I could, like... I could move to Japan.

7811
04:13:02,680 --> 04:13:05,620
And just, like, experience the different types of food.

7812
04:13:05,960 --> 04:13:07,180
Not become a vlogger.

7813
04:13:07,320 --> 04:13:09,280
I meant, like... I meant just, like...

7814
04:13:09,280 --> 04:13:12,220
Like, experience life more.

7815
04:13:12,540 --> 04:13:13,020
You know?

7816
04:13:14,120 --> 04:13:15,620
And I was thinking about that.

7817
04:13:15,660 --> 04:13:16,180
I was, like...

7818
04:13:16,180 --> 04:13:21,940
I was just, like, having, like, a low-key midlife streamer crisis about it to my manager.

7819
04:13:22,400 --> 04:13:22,820
About it.

7820
04:13:22,860 --> 04:13:26,120
I was like, am I throwing it all away?

7821
04:13:26,820 --> 04:13:27,300
Like...

7822
04:13:27,300 --> 04:13:29,900
What if I can't experience that?

7823
04:13:30,140 --> 04:13:32,040
Like, should I... Should I be, like...

7824
04:13:32,040 --> 04:13:33,120
Should I move to Japan?

7825
04:13:33,540 --> 04:13:34,020
Like...

7826
04:13:35,480 --> 04:13:36,300
I was like...

7827
04:13:36,300 --> 04:13:36,680
I was like...

7828
04:13:36,680 --> 04:13:37,600
Do I move to Japan?

7829
04:13:38,040 --> 04:13:39,180
Do I move to LA?

7830
04:13:39,660 --> 04:13:40,080
Like...

7831
04:13:40,080 --> 04:13:41,000
What do I do?

7832
04:13:41,760 --> 04:13:42,180
Like...

7833
04:13:49,240 --> 04:13:51,360
And, like, you know, I'm okay now.

7834
04:13:51,560 --> 04:13:52,260
I'm okay.

7835
04:13:52,560 --> 04:13:53,460
I'm okay now.

7836
04:13:53,660 --> 04:13:54,540
And it's just, like...

7837
04:13:54,540 --> 04:13:55,540
I was just thinking, like...

7838
04:13:55,540 --> 04:13:57,420
But then I realized, like, you know...

7839
04:13:57,420 --> 04:13:58,580
I could always do that later.

7840
04:13:58,900 --> 04:13:59,300
You know?

7841
04:13:59,520 --> 04:14:01,560
I could always do that later in my life.

7842
04:14:01,740 --> 04:14:02,040
It doesn't...

7843
04:14:02,040 --> 04:14:03,360
I don't have to, like, you know...

7844
04:14:03,360 --> 04:14:04,940
Something that I have to do when I'm young.

7845
04:14:05,200 --> 04:14:07,600
Or, like, at my current age right now.

7846
04:14:08,660 --> 04:14:09,060
Um...

7847
04:14:09,060 --> 04:14:11,940
I could always do that later on in my life.

7848
04:14:12,160 --> 04:14:13,320
Later on in my career.

7849
04:14:13,680 --> 04:14:15,700
Where things are, like, less...

7850
04:14:15,700 --> 04:14:17,240
Or in New York City, though.

7851
04:14:17,400 --> 04:14:17,720
I don't know.

7852
04:14:17,720 --> 04:14:19,340
New York City is scary.

7853
04:14:19,780 --> 04:14:28,240
I feel... New York City feels a little scary right now.

7854
04:14:28,540 --> 04:14:32,660
Or not... I would love to just like be there for the... I love the musicals though.

7855
04:14:32,720 --> 04:14:33,740
I love musicals.

7856
04:14:33,920 --> 04:14:41,600
But yeah, I was like... But now I'm like... Maybe I'll just like... Now I enjoy the moment right now.

7857
04:14:41,780 --> 04:14:42,760
Just enjoy the moment.

7858
04:14:45,000 --> 04:14:47,660
Do like... What I... Like...

7859
04:14:47,660 --> 04:14:51,260
Do like... You know... Do what... I wanna do.

7860
04:14:51,980 --> 04:14:56,120
Um... I think also like... I do get a little jealous.

7861
04:14:56,360 --> 04:15:00,520
I get a little jealous of all these VTubers like traveling to see each other.

7862
04:15:01,140 --> 04:15:02,180
Traveling a lot.

7863
04:15:02,440 --> 04:15:03,500
Hang out in real life.

7864
04:15:03,640 --> 04:15:07,440
Cause I'm very... I'm a very... What's the word?

7865
04:15:07,740 --> 04:15:09,360
I'm very closed off.

7866
04:15:09,560 --> 04:15:11,740
And I'm a very private person in general.

7867
04:15:12,600 --> 04:15:14,400
Um... Oh my gosh.

7868
04:15:14,700 --> 04:15:16,100
I... I had an incident.

7869
04:15:16,540 --> 04:15:17,560
This was a while.

7870
04:15:17,560 --> 04:15:18,440
A long time ago.

7871
04:15:18,660 --> 04:15:21,580
I had an... I have a... Huge trust issues.

7872
04:15:21,840 --> 04:15:23,240
I have very big trust issues.

7873
04:15:23,520 --> 04:15:25,600
I had an incident a long time ago.

7874
04:15:25,860 --> 04:15:29,220
And this was why I don't like... See a lot of people in real life.

7875
04:15:29,680 --> 04:15:31,060
Um... Because of what happened.

7876
04:15:31,660 --> 04:15:34,000
But I had... This was a long time ago.

7877
04:15:34,200 --> 04:15:38,000
Where I... Um... Met up with some people.

7878
04:15:39,000 --> 04:15:43,780
And... Um... And thought it was like... A private dinner with everyone.

7879
04:15:44,300 --> 04:15:47,540
And then... And then like... A couple of months later...

7880
04:15:48,000 --> 04:15:50,720
A picture of me like... Got leaked.

7881
04:15:51,800 --> 04:15:53,320
Um... Like got... It was a long time.

7882
04:15:53,400 --> 04:15:54,560
But it got leaked on the internet.

7883
04:15:54,900 --> 04:15:57,100
And then... It was just my picture.

7884
04:15:57,400 --> 04:15:59,420
It was like a group photo of everyone.

7885
04:15:59,720 --> 04:16:02,200
And somebody like... Cropped my picture.

7886
04:16:02,380 --> 04:16:03,500
And like... Leaped it.

7887
04:16:03,660 --> 04:16:07,820
And then like... And then that like... Like made me so scared.

7888
04:16:07,840 --> 04:16:09,600
Of actually like... Meeting up with people.

7889
04:16:09,740 --> 04:16:11,040
Cause I was like... Who would do that?

7890
04:16:11,120 --> 04:16:13,400
I was so... I was like... Oh my god.

7891
04:16:13,400 --> 04:16:14,620
That's so fucked up.

7892
04:16:14,760 --> 04:16:15,800
Like, who would do that?

7893
04:16:17,580 --> 04:16:19,200
Yeah, it was just me, though.

7894
04:16:19,420 --> 04:16:24,880
Like, someone in that group really hated me or something.

7895
04:16:24,880 --> 04:16:26,220
Or, like, I don't know.

7896
04:16:26,400 --> 04:16:28,180
I thought we were all friends, too.

7897
04:16:28,380 --> 04:16:29,940
I thought we were, like, all friends.

7898
04:16:30,240 --> 04:16:33,580
And then someone in that group, like...

7899
04:16:33,580 --> 04:16:36,840
And it was, like, a private dinner where, like, all of us were, like...

7900
04:16:36,840 --> 04:16:39,420
Like, we all, like, kept to ourselves and stuff like that.

7901
04:16:39,520 --> 04:16:40,120
And I was like, yay!

7902
04:16:40,600 --> 04:16:42,840
Like, oh, it's a great experience and everything.

7903
04:16:42,840 --> 04:16:44,500
And everyone was so happy there.

7904
04:16:45,140 --> 04:16:49,840
And then, like, someone cropped, picked just me.

7905
04:16:50,080 --> 04:16:52,660
And then, like, leaked it.

7906
04:16:52,760 --> 04:16:54,380
And I was like, what the fuck?

7907
04:16:54,600 --> 04:16:56,160
Like, I was like, what?

7908
04:16:56,460 --> 04:16:57,600
Like, yeah.

7909
04:16:59,880 --> 04:17:02,460
But this was a long time ago.

7910
04:17:04,480 --> 04:17:05,040
Yeah.

7911
04:17:05,360 --> 04:17:11,200
And so, like, because of that also, like, really messed me up.

7912
04:17:11,200 --> 04:17:14,660
And I had, like, big trust issues when it comes to meeting up with people.

7913
04:17:14,920 --> 04:17:16,140
Because, like, I'm like...

7914
04:17:16,140 --> 04:17:18,100
I thought, like, all of us were cool of each other.

7915
04:17:18,220 --> 04:17:21,640
Like, everyone had a great time together during that dinner, too.

7916
04:17:22,120 --> 04:17:23,380
And, like, we're all drinking.

7917
04:17:23,400 --> 04:17:25,060
We all had a good time together.

7918
04:17:26,760 --> 04:17:31,600
And then, like, a couple of months later, like, that picture got leaked.

7919
04:17:31,760 --> 04:17:34,700
And then I was so confused because it was just me.

7920
04:17:34,800 --> 04:17:37,300
Because it was a group picture of all of us, too.

7921
04:17:39,980 --> 04:17:45,360
And because of that, like, I'm very hesitant of meeting with people, too, because of that.

7922
04:17:45,500 --> 04:17:47,860
Because, like, I'm like, what if you're not cool with me?

7923
04:17:47,880 --> 04:17:49,300
And I didn't know that, you know?

7924
04:17:49,300 --> 04:17:53,600
Like, what if, like, you're friends with someone that's not cool, like, doesn't like me?

7925
04:17:53,720 --> 04:17:55,200
Because I know I'm, like, a very...

7926
04:17:55,200 --> 04:17:57,580
Like, even, like, now, I know I'm a very...

7927
04:17:58,300 --> 04:18:00,720
Like, I don't know if I say controversial figure.

7928
04:18:01,040 --> 04:18:04,280
But, like, you know, some people like me and some people don't.

7929
04:18:04,380 --> 04:18:05,640
Depending on who you're friends with.

7930
04:18:06,040 --> 04:18:11,760
So I'm just like, oh, what if, like, I meet up with someone and they actually secretly didn't like me?

7931
04:18:11,880 --> 04:18:15,600
And then, like, oh my god, what if, like, stuff gets leaked?

7932
04:18:16,640 --> 04:18:42,960
Especially when I'm a VTuber, as a VTuber too, yeah, I'm very polarizing, yeah, and I'm like, oh man, that worries me a lot, because now I have to keep my identity extra secret too, because of, you know, because I'm a VTuber too, because I like the privacy.

7933
04:18:42,960 --> 04:19:05,140
That's actually a topic in the podcast, where we're talking about, like, privacy stuff, and I like being a VTuber because of having my privacy respected, and stuff like that, and that's what I like too, and so I have to be a lot more careful about things like that.

7934
04:19:05,140 --> 04:19:26,320
That's why, like, I'm like, like, I do like envy the VTubers that travel a lot, that travel a lot, and like, you know, meet with other people, and stuff like that, and doing things where, you know, you know, they get to meet so many people, and, you know,

7935
04:19:26,420 --> 04:19:28,620
doing a lot of IRL stuff together and everything.

7936
04:19:30,300 --> 04:19:46,200
And, and I do get a little jealous, and I think, like, obviously that's, like, a thing that I have to, a hurdle I have to get past myself, and that's preventing me from doing a lot of fun things, because of the paranoia and stuff, because of the, I guess,

7937
04:19:46,300 --> 04:19:47,800
like, the PTSD from that.

7938
04:19:48,340 --> 04:20:00,340
So, um, it is, like, a little thing that I have to learn to grow from it, because I do have, like, a bit of PTSD from that, and that's why I don't, I try not to, like, I, I don't do that in general.

7939
04:20:00,820 --> 04:20:08,860
Um, but I do envy the VTubers that can do that, and that do travel a lot, too, to meet up with people, and, like, do content together.

7940
04:20:09,220 --> 04:20:19,640
I also envy, like, you know, seeing, like, IRL streamers do that, too, when they do, like, IRL live streams of, like, um, meeting people, exploring conventions, and stuff like that.

7941
04:20:19,820 --> 04:20:33,240
That, that's, like, uh, I know, like, some people are like, oh, why don't you ever do, okay, personally, though, I would say, I, I personally don't do, I, I never do live streams, where I'm, like, you know, I've seen, like, people would do, like, would walk around,

7942
04:20:33,740 --> 04:20:39,940
um, they walk around conventions and stuff, and do, like, a stream, like, walking around conventions and stuff.

7943
04:20:40,600 --> 04:20:42,620
Um, I don't do that.

7944
04:20:42,780 --> 04:20:53,340
I, people ask, always ask, because when I go around conventions, um, with my staff team, I do it off stream, because, one, I have no idea what's gonna happen on stream.

7945
04:20:54,920 --> 04:21:06,260
Like, I, I, I am so, I don't, I don't like the, I don't like the, um, what's the, the risk in that?

7946
04:21:06,260 --> 04:21:22,300
Especially when I know I'm more of a polarizing figure, and, like, you know, I have aunties, I know that, like, I know I have aunties, and I know some people don't like me in general, so I'm, like, I, I, I don't, I don't want the uncertainty or the risk of,

7947
04:21:22,300 --> 04:21:23,620
like, doing stuff like that.

7948
04:21:23,620 --> 04:21:38,800
And then, also, um, the second thing is that, uh, the second thing is that, um, I also want to respect the privacy of other people, too.

7949
04:21:39,300 --> 04:21:45,240
Um, so, uh, because, you know, so maybe someone doesn't want to be on stream, you know?

7950
04:21:45,380 --> 04:21:53,880
Like, even if it's just, like, a glimpse or something, I feel like, for me, I feel awkward doing stuff like that, because, like, maybe someone doesn't want to be on camera, you know?

7951
04:21:54,240 --> 04:22:04,260
So, um, I'm worried that, you know, like, if an artist at, an artist alley doesn't want to be shown on camera and stuff like that, then, you know, I don't want to, like, make them uncomfortable.

7952
04:22:05,120 --> 04:22:09,580
And, uh, that's why I try, I don't, I, I personally won't do it.

7953
04:22:09,780 --> 04:22:19,300
But I know a lot of people, uh, a lot of people, uh, don't mind it, and it is fun, because it's, like, you know, you don't have FOMO.

7954
04:22:19,420 --> 04:22:20,520
You're watching a stream.

7955
04:22:20,760 --> 04:22:29,460
You're watching a stream, um, just so you can enjoy, like, you know, enjoy the, the environment and stuff with your favorite streamer.

7956
04:22:29,860 --> 04:22:30,680
And, yeah.

7957
04:22:31,240 --> 04:22:42,460
Um, I think, like, if I ever do something like that, it would definitely be an edited video, so I can, like, blur the faces and, uh, blur the faces and, like, cover things up just in case, you know.

7958
04:22:43,340 --> 04:22:46,260
Um, Oscar, welcome to the tomato farm.

7959
04:22:46,400 --> 04:22:47,060
Welcome, welcome.

7960
04:22:47,680 --> 04:22:49,080
Paladin, thank you for the super chat.

7961
04:22:49,200 --> 04:22:49,880
Thank you, thank you.

7962
04:22:50,120 --> 04:22:52,580
I've been signaled out before and cut myself off from the others.

7963
04:22:52,700 --> 04:22:56,700
As I am older, the best advice I can give you is not let fear prevent you from doing something.

7964
04:22:57,000 --> 04:22:58,340
As big as a mistake of my life.

7965
04:22:58,420 --> 04:23:08,620
Yeah, that's basically for me, too, like, I do have a lot of work in terms of, like, making sure I'm not scared to, like, hang out with people and stuff.

7966
04:23:09,260 --> 04:23:25,180
Um, I know, like, Mint travels so much and meets up with so many people, and I envy her, and I envy her for having, like, so much, I guess, like, extrovert charisma to just, uh, do all of that, um, in general.

7967
04:23:25,700 --> 04:23:26,580
Uh, maybe one day.

7968
04:23:26,800 --> 04:23:30,020
Maybe one day I'll be brave enough to do something like that.

7969
04:23:30,540 --> 04:23:35,140
Um, anyway, that's my, that's my life talk today.

7970
04:23:37,320 --> 04:23:39,780
I hope you guys had a fun time.

7971
04:23:40,480 --> 04:23:45,940
Um, I hope you guys all had a fun time listening to me yap and hanging out with the sloppy sisters today.

7972
04:23:46,580 --> 04:23:53,220
Um, tomorrow I'll be playing Elden Ring, uh, Sunday, no stream, as always, no stream on Sunday.

7973
04:23:53,400 --> 04:23:58,020
I don't know about Monday, we'll see, but I won't have a stream on Sunday, but tomorrow I'll be doing Elden Ring.

7974
04:23:58,220 --> 04:24:09,260
Uh, I'm gonna head off now, as always, everybody, stay hydrated, posture check, get up and move around to get that blood flowing, and if you stay up for me, head to bed, cause you deserve it.

7975
04:24:09,420 --> 04:24:10,820
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

7976
04:24:11,300 --> 04:24:12,260
Uh, bye, guys.

7977
04:24:13,220 --> 04:24:13,680
Bye!
