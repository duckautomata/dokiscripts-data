00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:01,660
Hey,

2
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:39,560
hello, hello, we are back for a second stream today.

3
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:43,880
This is our first solo stream of the week and the last solo
stream of the week.

4
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,840
And today was this week was more like collab week.

5
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:50,680
But today I'm wanting to play this game for now.

6
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,940
I just realized I didn't even realize there was Twitch
integration.

7
00:05:53,060 --> 00:06:00,060
If I knew there was Twitch integration, I would have, I
would have done it on Twitch, honestly.

8
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,300
This would have been really fun.

9
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:06,300
It's like I remember when we did Call of the Lab, that means
I could like, I could judge you guys.

10
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:11,700
I could sacrifice you to the pit.

11
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,060
Brady, thank you for the super chat.

12
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:16,300
Thank you.

00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:16,740
Thank you.

14
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,820
The super is a celebration of stop killing games.

15
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,860
Officially having enough votes to make the EU listen.

16
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:22,780
Yeah, congratulations.

17
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:24,320
Thank you for the super chat.

18
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:24,800
Thank you.

19
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,660
Thank you, Brady.

20
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:32,060
But yeah, I've been looking forward to this game for, to
play this game for a bit.

21
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,000
So I'm super excited.

22
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:43,120
yay it's basically like i said it's basically like pay rich

i shall build a safe haven for all humans for all dragons

24
00:06:53,740 --> 00:07:01,780
all right we're gonna let's see i wonder if i can actually i
wonder how that works give me a sec let me i don't know if

25
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:06,940
sound guy is alive either so Let me check how Twitch site.

26
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,700
Okay, I'm going to sign into my Twitch.

27
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,140
And now I wonder if we could just use the chat.

28
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:14,120
Like, do I have to actually be live?

29
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,360
That's what I want to know.

30
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,940
I've successfully logged into my Twitch.

31
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:32,360
Okay, now how does Twitch integration zombie quarantine zone
work?

32
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:34,760
All right, let me try this.

33
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:44,300
Gladiator directly influenced gameplay by voting on events
through chat increasing interactions wait no

34
00:07:47,580 --> 00:08:00,300
wait no wait i'm not i'm i'm i'm i might unlink twitch
integration all right all right all right let me double

35
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:10,880
check uh how does it work you need to add viewers give
permission choose symptoms and then should show give views

36
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:19,460
permission to extend and then choose symptoms and i think it
only works in endless mode and not in campaign mode okay all

37
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:23,740
right well um i'm not letting you guys into my game

38
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:37,060
i'm not gonna let you guys uh vote for the bunch that
happens in my game then let me let me not let that happen

39
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,520
Because I know you guys are just going to be like, more
zombies!

40
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,800
Did somebody say more zombie?

41
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:53,820
Guys, at one point, there might be too many zombies.

42
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:01,060
Guys, at one point, there might be too many zombies.

43
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,680
All right, I need to make sure there's no motion blur.

44
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,740
Oh, yeah, for those who are...

45
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:10,880
I hope everyone that's currently affected by the worst
snowstorm in the world.

46
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:15,340
Um, it's doing okay right now in America and Ontario.

47
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,140
It was in Ottawa.

48
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,960
I don't, I don't keep track.

49
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:21,220
They both start with Owen.

50
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:26,740
Like, the only, the only Canadian place I recognize is the
west coast of Canada.

51
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:33,380
Uh, oh, Ontario is on.

52
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,040
Oh, nice.

53
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,040
That, uh, for now, the worst storm for now.

54
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:38,600
That's true.

55
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,180
Global clueling does get worse every year.

56
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,360
That's true.

57
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,080
Yeah, I heard like New York is really bad because of the
snow too.

58
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,720
Like, they're getting like how many inches of snow.

59
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:54,620
And at the moment, that's your own.

60
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:58,240
Yeah, but I only pay attention to the west coast of Canada.

61
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:00,860
Everything else is non-existent to me.

62
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:05,960
I think the worst part is just, I think snow is the worst
part too.

63
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:14,780
storm like what is it called ice rain i'm like what the fuck
is ice rain i'd like i was like is it hell and then my some

00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,760
I don't know what it is in freedom units.

77
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:49,580
You guys can convert it yourself.

78
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:53,840
I have no idea what it is in freedom units.

79
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:56,940
But minus 50 degrees is fucked up right now.

80
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,960
That's actually fucked up.

81
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:03,480

No names.

112
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,060

Thank you.

I will be on that plane and take it to another country.

116
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,640
I would be on that plane.

117
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:23,780
Because I'd be like.

118
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,600
Also because I'd be like.

119
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:26,720
Don't worry guys.

120
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,040
I'm pretty sure I'm immune to this.

121
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,140
It's going to be me.

122
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:31,740
I'll be like.

123
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,220
Guys don't worry.

124
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:33,920
I'm dead.

125
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,080
I might have been.

126
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,340
I'm a main character.

127
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,680
I'm main character syndrome.

128
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,480
I'm definitely immune.

129
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,520
I'm just different.

130
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,920
I mean, it's because, like, I'm gonna fucking die anyway.

131
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:51,180
I'm gonna fucking become a zombie anyway.

132
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,900
So might as well, like, help my team.

133
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:55,520
You know?

134
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,220
I might as well fucking help the team out, you know?

135
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:01,400
I'm gonna fucking die and become a zombie.

136
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,600
Gotta help the team out.

137
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:11,200
Wow, Toki.

138
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,040
I'm a team player.

139
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,780
How am I team humanity?

140
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,560
Have I fucking already got bit?

141
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,900
Also, I could be immune, too.

142
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,620
The possibility of me being immune.

143
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:25,640
We don't know if we're immune until we live through it.

144
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,920
And what if, you know, what if they cure me?

145
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,200
You know, what if I fly?

146
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:34,000
What if I, like, find out, like, guys, I have to fly to...

147
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,040
I don't know.

148
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:35,320
I'm trying.

149
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:37,680
Guys, I have to fly to Sweden, guys.

150
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:41,400
They said they might have found the cure for zombies.

151
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,880
So of course I'll hide the fight.

152
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,600
I'll be like, guys, I have to get to Sweden.

153
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,580
They said they found the cure to zombies.

154
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,040
I could be one in a million, exactly.

155
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,920
Guys, they need my blood for the cure.

156
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,820
I'm not taking any chances.

157
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:04,400
I gotta take her out.

158
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:09,260
Where's Georgie?

159
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:11,020
Oh, here.

160
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:14,600
Talk to Georgie for the bloodshed.

161
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:19,480
Jokie bird flu spreads after the first hour of being agreed.

162
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:20,540

Let's see.

167
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,720

187
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:46,380
reward game up these okay let me know it's better once
you've recorded the symptoms it's time to decide their fate

188
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:56,320
let's switch to the distribution tab the distribution tag
still not sure no worries just send them into quarantine let

189
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:04,280
them sit for a few days and the virus will reveal itself why
don't I just liquidate this can't piss in the gas tank not

190
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:10,200
sure what he meant yeah so to make for our safety we have to
make sure doki never gets bit nst thank you for the super

quarantine i don't i i'm not taking any chances remember

193
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:29,620
there's no cure liquidation of painful man be certain once
you send a survivor this decision cannot be reversed the

194
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:36,780
checkpoint field uh sent survivors here to investigate
unknown symptoms uh temporary accommodation for help send

195
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:42,860
all not you send survivors to a block even when it's full
but the survivors there will start to get sick and die okay

196
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:59,240
okay so obviously do not send sick people there all right
that's fine uh after expecting survivors okay i got this so

197
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:05,940
we'll take bribes guys i think in zombie apocalypse money
has no more value it's all about Could take food bribes.

198
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:06,760
That is true.

199
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,500
You gotta be kidding me.

200
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,800
Well, then...

201
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,560

Your eyes are fucked up.

203
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:16,380
Also, I gotta fix the graphics.

204
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:18,060
Maybe I shouldn't play on high.

205
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,100
It's a little too much, maybe.

206
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,100
I'll do a medium.

207
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:23,780

I mean, this tells me to send her in.

223
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,420
So, I think it's fine.

224

00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,180
You know what?

226
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:25,260
We will be evacuating the survivors' block.

227
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:31,440
The top brass will be very upset with us if we don't move a
adequate number of healthy people.

228
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:32,040
Oh.

229
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:40,280
Examine the survivors in the line and send the unaffected
onto the block They're always hiding it's under her shirt.

292
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:33,020

rabies but like at least it's not a zombie bite

293
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:43,070
Like, you know, at least it's not death by zombies.

294
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:44,490
Death by rabies.

295
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:46,630

00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:55,970
Wait, this should be my new job.

00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:05,450
Wait, that shit's easy money.

304
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:09,730
The more people I kill them...

305
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:10,390
Wait, actually.

306
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:13,430
The more people that I kill, the more money I get.

307
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:15,690
What?

308
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:17,690

That's 1K.

312
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:22,010
That's 1K approval.

313
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:26,830
You mean, technically, I could just spread the virus.

314
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:34,210
Like, I can just, like, have, like, a little pet zombie and
just have to invite someone to buy the hand and be like, oh,

315
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:36,130
gotta take him to execution, I guess.

316
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:39,770
Alright.

317
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:48,730
maybe this is the zombie it maybe it's like 20 day eight
days later zombie apocalypse where it's only like seclude

318
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:58,070
it's only like uh what's the word it's only contained in the
united states or canada this could be canada we're in

319
00:27:58,070 --> 00:28:06,310
celsius degrees here or it's only contained in canada so uh
so like i could just fly fly somewhere else and just use my

320
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:13,860
money Is it the survivor in quarantine?

321
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,980
Oh, yeah, we gotta check if they're...

322
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:17,460
If they turned or not.

323
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,440
Alright, inspect the court every day.

324
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,700
Send the survivor infected survivors.

325
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:25,440
Well, you must clear quarantine when there is a zombie.

326
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:28,700
Alright, Lurias can look and behave differently for
different.

327
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:29,920
Send survivors to quarantine.

328
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:35,360
Yeah, I know, but this is Celsius, so...

329
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,160
Wait, who's this guy?

330
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,340
Oh, yeah, he had green yellow.

331
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:41,800
Then pick an assignment.

332
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:48,040
All right, um, I guess I'll inspect them.

333
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:49,820

00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,360

335
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:00,560
It says E.

336
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,200
How do I...

337
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:07,250
I'm trying...

338
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:08,150
Oh, oh!

339
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:10,770
What the fuck is this?

340
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:11,630
Is this for...

341
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:12,930
What is this for then?

342
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:16,750
Oh, that's to kill everyone.

343
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:17,330
Everyone

344
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:23,790
To kill everyone lever I was ready.

345
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:27,450

346
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:35,250
Rob the same thing I was ready

347
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:49,230
I was ready for the money I heard that get eight hundred
dollars per person and I was fucking ready to touch that

348
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:53,950
lever Like, yeah, he was definitely a zombie, guys.

349
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:58,210
I don't really know.

350
00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:00,270
Have you seen the Pathologic Games?

351
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:05,610
As far as that is, the only series that make you seriously
considering the selling your only gun and three bullets for

352
00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:05,910
food.

353
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:08,690
If we're looking for something different, that fit the bill.

354
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:09,250
Bill, thank you.

355
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:10,130

Thank you.

357
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:11,270
Thank you.

358
00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:14,310
But then I lose my gun.

359
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:16,390
Is that worth it?

360
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:20,130
But what about gun?

361
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:25,230
Also, like...

362
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:27,210
I mean, he seems fine.

363
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:29,650
Oh, wait, what?

364
00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:31,310
Oh, I could test his temperature.

365
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:32,750
Okay.

366
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:40,260
High and extreme, bro, I'd rather get this.

367
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:46,080
Wait, have I already purchased it?

368
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,180
Oh, I don't have enough.

369
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:50,900
I mean, should I send him in?

370
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,400
He doesn't see... I don't know.

371
00:30:55,480 --> 00:31:02,160
develop yeah but shouldn't we wait a couple oh oh his eyes
are better oh i didn't even sorry i forgot to look at the

372
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:11,000
most important oh they must have found they must have killed
a deer oh yeah no he's fine all right go into survivor blah

374
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:26,460

00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:39,420
All right.

376
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:41,020
Or is it?

377
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:42,220
Oh, there it is.

378
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:47,800
Use the thermal pulse to check a survivor's vital sign.

379
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:48,720
Sneezing or hiccuping.

380
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:51,540
Maybe signs of an elevated... Okay, okay.

381
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:51,820
Elevate.

382
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:52,240
Oh, signs.

383
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:55,140
Like, sneezing or hiccuping may be a sign of zombie.

384
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,820
I was like, Oh my god.

385
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:02,000
Bro, the zombie virus is fucking intense.

386
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,480
You just can't have anything.

387
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:06,420
And freckles, too, apparently.

388
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,160
The zombie rash.

389
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,260
I fucking knew it.

390
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:11,220
I knew they had no souls in them.

391
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:16,490
Use the tool.

392
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:19,270
Oh.

393
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:19,930
Oh.

394
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:21,430
Oh.

395
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:23,150
Sneezing and hiccuping.

396
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:23,730
Zombie.

397
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:26,930
Is that?

398
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:32,890
Oh, oh, sneezing and oh, that's not good.

399
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:34,230
Wait, what's the normal temperature?

400
00:32:36,770 --> 00:32:38,470
Eat the getter.

401
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:45,710
Okay, 155, 157, 43 degrees.

00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:54,450
Oh, wait.

That's a sign of infection.

412
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:14,220
She's just really nervous.

413
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:17,000
Bro, her brain is mushed.

414
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,040
There's no way.

415
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:18,800
I'm sending her.

416
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:19,660
We could not.

417
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:21,760
Maybe she has a cold.

418
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:24,360
I swear to God, I will send her to quarantine.

419
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,720
If she turns into a zombie.

420
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:31,320
If she turns into a zombie, I swear to God, yes, I was
right.

421
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:33,860
Cool.

422
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:35,300

00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:14,830

Quarantine time.

430
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:17,170
You gotta be kidding me.

431
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:17,450
What?

432
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:18,890
What?

433
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:21,530
How is that poor inspection?

434
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:24,550
How is that?

435
00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:28,670
She seems mostly okay.

436
00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:29,710
Oh, yeah, fine.

437
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:30,630
I'll send her out.

438
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:32,730
Maybe I shouldn't.

439
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:35,550
All right, get over here.

440
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:38,090
I'll recheck you.

441
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:41,150
Wait, first...

442
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:43,290
But she has yellow eyes, though.

443
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:45,190
Look at her.

444
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:47,510
Oh, she...

445
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:51,550
Oh, 36 is lower than 37.

446
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:54,950
Guys, it's not my fault.

447
00:35:55,010 --> 00:35:56,290
I was rounding up.

448
00:35:57,970 --> 00:35:59,050
Look, see?

449
00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:01,510
It hit 36.39.

450
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:03,990
And I was like, I'm rounding that up.

451
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:05,450
I'm rounding that shit up.

452
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:07,170
But she still has yellow eyes, though.

453
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:08,130
So go back in there.

454
00:36:09,490 --> 00:36:12,910
I didn't realize, like, I had to get every symptom correct.

455
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:15,350
I didn't know that.

456
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:16,350
All right, go back in.

457
00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:18,290
Go back in there.

458
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:22,030
At least it's not a death sentence.

459
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:25,670
Yeah, I'm rounding it up 0.5.

460
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:28,290
All right, next.

461
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:31,750
Oh, she's sneezing.

462
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:34,490
I know the rules.

463
00:36:34,930 --> 00:36:36,530
I wouldn't be here if I wasn't okay.

464
00:36:37,490 --> 00:36:39,210

I don't think we have any kids.

472
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:26,890
I'm pretty sure.

473
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:30,030
Yeah.

474
00:37:31,370 --> 00:37:40,870
From what I remember, we don't have any kids at the safe
haven.

475
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:44,910
But we do have kids in the liquidation center.

476

They're like, oh, I think you said it in a survivor.

509
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:11,670

00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:08,770
Sorry, that's your kid, right?

539
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:09,730

Just a little tattoo before...

542
00:42:17,690 --> 00:42:23,390
That would suck if you get a tattoo right before, like, a
bite-mark tattoo right before the zombie apocalypse.

543
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:27,110
They're like, I was just trying to be edgy.

00:46:27,770 --> 00:46:28,150
We're fine.

588
00:46:28,370 --> 00:46:28,930
We're so safe.

589
00:46:30,950 --> 00:46:31,530
We're so safe.

590
00:46:31,710 --> 00:46:32,030
Look at that.

591
00:46:33,950 --> 00:46:34,510
Look at that.

592
00:46:34,950 --> 00:46:35,590

593
00:46:36,730 --> 00:46:37,190

00:46:43,190 --> 00:46:45,690
Just eight more ways.

598
00:46:47,710 --> 00:46:53,770

00:46:54,050 --> 00:46:54,190
Easy.

Yeah.

602
00:46:57,470 --> 00:47:00,150
Yeah, I didn't admit any infected survivors.

603
00:47:00,490 --> 00:47:01,470
It's a bare minimum.

604
00:47:01,870 --> 00:47:02,790
Even made me hungry.

605
00:47:03,550 --> 00:47:06,830
Remember, the better a man eats, the longer he can fight.

606
00:47:07,490 --> 00:47:10,690
As for civilians, they don't last long without food either.

607
00:47:11,470 --> 00:47:13,090
Make sure everyone gets fit.

608
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:13,770
What?

609
00:47:14,430 --> 00:47:16,010
I have to be a chef too?

610
00:47:17,370 --> 00:47:21,730
Switch to the monitor to campus or upgrade buildings or
purchase what?

611
00:47:22,750 --> 00:47:23,550
Oh my god.

612

615
00:47:37,790 --> 00:47:45,410
Okay Oh my god I have face management as well.

616
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:46,530
Oh my god.

617
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:48,730
Why do I have to do everything?

618
00:47:49,550 --> 00:47:52,790
Do I not have, do I, is there no other people hired for
this?

619
00:47:54,310 --> 00:47:56,090
I got promoted to a manager.

620
00:47:56,310 --> 00:47:57,130
No extra pay.

621
00:47:57,350 --> 00:47:58,570
Just extra work.

622
00:48:01,210 --> 00:48:03,250
I am for a raw management.

623
00:48:03,510 --> 00:48:06,750
This includes the survivors, provisions, power.

624
00:48:07,070 --> 00:48:09,250
Where is the upper management?

625
00:48:10,590 --> 00:48:11,970
I'm the only worker here.

626
00:48:12,090 --> 00:48:13,470
It's just soldiers and me.

627
00:48:13,670 --> 00:48:16,610
I was the only one that graduated high school.

628
00:48:17,810 --> 00:48:20,890

very well known for multitasking.

632
00:48:53,110 --> 00:48:55,450
Survivors go ahead, the more survivors we have, the more
food we don't need.

633
00:48:55,670 --> 00:48:58,810
Buildings are how we meet the needs of survivors and demands
of our mission.

634
00:48:58,950 --> 00:49:01,830
You'll now build and upgrade and increase housing storage.

635
00:49:02,010 --> 00:49:04,230
The power is the lifeblood of this regularly.

636
00:49:04,710 --> 00:49:10,010
Check on the generator and make sure it has enough fuel and
the total power does not exceed the...

637
00:49:10,010 --> 00:49:10,950
Oh my god, okay.

638
00:49:12,210 --> 00:49:13,630

will deteriorate.

646
00:50:22,580 --> 00:50:26,600
Survivors who fall ill can be served to help with Medkit's
disdainment essential for maintaining a robust checkpoint.

647
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:28,560
A healthy survivor will become sick.

648
00:50:28,660 --> 00:50:29,840
A sick survivor will die.

649
00:50:29,980 --> 00:50:31,340

You don't have to be really, really thirsty today.

00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:50,060
Alright, oh, it's still hiccuping.

00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:58,300
We can fix her.

709
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:02,260

nightmare.

Go back into quarantine.

722
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:42,460
You're crying out loud.

723
00:54:44,540 --> 00:54:45,840
She's healing.

724
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:47,800

00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:07,280
Alright.

742
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:07,860
We should...

743
00:56:07,860 --> 00:56:10,960
If it's like an airport inspection, what are they called
again?

744
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:11,940
TSA?

745
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:13,740
They should be giving me a T pose.

746
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:15,500
So rude.

747
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:18,120
Have you guys ever done TSA before?

748
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:18,960
Come on.

749
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:24,180
He's just very dirty.

750
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:28,540
I mean, he's not hiccuping or anything.

751
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:29,300
He's just dirty.

752
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:30,600
He just hasn't had a shower.

753
00:56:30,740 --> 00:56:30,960
Oh.

754
00:56:32,060 --> 00:56:33,400
What the fuck?

755
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:38,460
Those look like zombie rash.

756
00:56:42,180 --> 00:56:42,540
All right.

757
00:56:43,060 --> 00:56:43,700
157.

758
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:44,840
36.

759
00:56:45,740 --> 00:56:52,400
Alright, 1-157, and then the zombie rash.

760
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:56,660
I'm just double checking if I have to round up.

761
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:01,160
Nope, you're safe there, except for the...

762
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:03,240
Except for the ginger vitus.

763
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:07,580
We gotta be sure, you know.

764
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:10,360
We gotta be sure it's not zombie rash.

765
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:11,440
I'm not sick, I swear.

766
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:14,740
Yeah?

767
00:57:15,460 --> 00:57:43,230

769
00:57:50,070 --> 00:57:51,530
Okay, let me double check.

770
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:53,990
187.

771
00:57:54,810 --> 00:57:55,730
Oh, yeah, no.

772
00:58:01,310 --> 00:58:02,430
Is that red?

773
00:58:03,690 --> 00:58:04,850
Oh, it's this cut.

774
00:58:04,990 --> 00:58:05,470
Okay, here.

775
00:58:05,670 --> 00:58:05,970
Yeah.

776
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:07,990
And then skin cuts.

777
00:58:09,070 --> 00:58:11,070
Oh, yeah, I'll do cuts on your head.

778
00:58:11,370 --> 00:58:13,530
Bro, what the fuck happened there?

779
00:58:13,870 --> 00:58:16,510
Were you trying to, like, wear a barbed wire?

780
00:58:18,110 --> 00:58:20,930
I mean, that's already enough for me.

781
00:58:22,230 --> 00:58:24,350
Yeah, bruises, just so I can never get extra pay.

782
00:58:26,410 --> 00:58:27,970
Alright, now we're sending over.

783
00:58:28,970 --> 00:58:31,190
Alright, we have some Fiji water for you over there.

784
00:58:31,250 --> 00:58:31,930
Am I in trouble?

785
00:58:32,270 --> 00:58:32,910
Come on.

786
00:58:32,990 --> 00:58:34,090
No, no, no.

787
00:58:34,250 --> 00:58:35,850
We just, you know...

788
00:58:35,850 --> 00:58:36,830
We noticed how...

789
00:58:37,650 --> 00:58:38,990
This is just a bad dream.

790
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:44,080
Just a...

791
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:45,360
Oh.

792
00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:48,180
Yep, just a very, very...

793
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:49,900
a very bad dream.

794
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:55,760
I feel like, I guess they don't know.

795
00:58:55,860 --> 00:59:01,060
I guess the survivors don't know, like, what the symptoms
are.

796
00:59:01,620 --> 00:59:06,820
And they're just like, oh, I mean, I guess they haven't seen
a mirror in a long time, too.

797
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:12,440
Because I'm like, why would you ever go?

798
00:59:12,740 --> 00:59:13,900
They might be immune.

799
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:14,760
You don't know that.

800
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:32,260
They could be immune guys or it's getting cut yeah yeah she
just she just had a taste of the devil's lettuce yeah but i

801
00:59:32,260 --> 00:59:40,880

eyes it's like i i guess she thought like maybe she could

803
00:59:53,380 --> 00:59:54,420

804
00:59:54,420 --> 00:59:55,860
You gotta...

805
00:59:55,860 --> 00:59:55,880
You gotta...

806
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:57,920
You gotta help the team out.

807
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:00,740
It's like, maybe she'll get past the...

808
01:00:00,740 --> 01:00:02,020
She'll get past the inspection.

809
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:03,080
Let's just get this over with.

810
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:05,920
Oh, that's a nasty bruise, though.

811
01:00:06,020 --> 01:00:07,840
That's a fucking nasty ass bruise.

812
01:00:09,380 --> 01:00:10,720
Oh, no, yellow eyes.

813
01:00:12,700 --> 01:00:13,220
116.

814
01:00:14,580 --> 01:00:15,560
Yeah, I would wear...

815
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:17,640
I feel like during inspection, though.

816
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:20,040
You know, during the inspection, you wouldn't.

817
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:23,200
36, 113.

818
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:29,060
The only issue is just that she has yellow eyes.

819
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:31,080
She's just sick.

820
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:33,320
So I'm like, I don't know.

821
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:38,180
Oh, man, I don't have enough quarantine spots, too.

822
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:42,120
Oh, I have to make a really tough decision here.

823
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:45,760
Oh, this is a 50-50.

824
01:00:46,900 --> 01:00:47,440
Guys.

825
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:51,280
Maybe...

826
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:55,380
Maybe one of them got worse.

827
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:57,340
You know?

828
01:00:59,460 --> 01:01:00,020
Penelope.

829
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:02,260
Hmm.

830
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:05,860
Oh, this is... I gotta make the decision.

831
01:01:05,980 --> 01:01:07,660
I am full, though.

832
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:09,080
We have...

833
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:11,680
Five... You know what?

834
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:12,360
It doesn't matter.

835
01:01:12,420 --> 01:01:13,520
I'm sending you to burn.

836
01:01:13,860 --> 01:01:14,840
It actually doesn't matter.

837
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:15,680
I just realized.

838
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:18,060
Because we just need four infected.

839
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:19,900
Poor non-infected, right?

840
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:23,700
And technically, we have five.

841
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:27,320
So, like, I don't need you.

842
01:01:33,420 --> 01:01:35,520
I made the bear...

843
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:36,760

01:03:55,060 --> 01:03:58,560
This has to be, like, the cleanest survivor I've ever seen.

859
01:04:03,780 --> 01:04:05,280
A lot of freckles.

860
01:04:07,300 --> 01:04:09,000
That's pretty suspicious.

861
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:11,580
Yeah, wait, oh, wait, no.

862
01:04:11,780 --> 01:04:13,460
No, the kicks are definitely not clean.

863
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:16,940
Like, where did you have access to clean water?

864
01:04:17,900 --> 01:04:27,160
Alright, well, the only thing I can notice is just a bruise
on your head, so I guess you're pretty safe right oh yeah no

865
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:37,000
that's definitely a bruise oh what the fuck did she fall did

867
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:53,360

868
01:04:55,580 --> 01:04:56,200
Alright, it's fine.

869
01:04:58,080 --> 01:05:01,900
Yeah, she definitely hits something on the way, so I'll send
you.

870
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:03,020
I'll send you over.

871
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:06,100
Do they even do anything for me?

872
01:05:07,220 --> 01:05:08,200
Alright, go in there.

873
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:09,720
Alright.

874
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:11,460
Last one.

875
01:05:11,540 --> 01:05:12,840
Last one for the day.

876
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:16,020
What's the point of all this?

877
01:05:16,700 --> 01:05:17,640
We're all dead already.

878
01:05:18,580 --> 01:05:19,000
Whoa.

879
01:05:19,340 --> 01:05:21,360
This is the healthiest one I've seen this.

880
01:05:21,380 --> 01:05:43,180

163 yeah

881
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:58,360
Tell me, yeah, definitely the healthiest cast.

882
01:05:59,260 --> 01:06:00,100
For sure.

883
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:05,520
Oh, yeah.

884
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:09,540
I mean, she did say what was the point.

885
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:10,360
You know what, girl?

886
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:12,220
Today's your lucky day.

887
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:15,800
Thanks for at least letting me live.

888
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:19,560
Yeah.

889
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:20,460
Yeah.

890
01:06:21,380 --> 01:06:22,160
No problem.

891
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:28,680
Yep.

892
01:06:29,380 --> 01:06:30,020
That's me.

893
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:33,340
That's me.

894
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:36,280
We're all dead already.

895
01:06:36,460 --> 01:06:38,360
I'm speak for yourself, sweetie.

896
01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:40,780
Petra said that you was super chat.

897
01:06:41,060 --> 01:06:41,260
Thank you.

898
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:41,960
Thank you.

899
01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:44,460
Another good day of work.

900
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:46,360
For a donkey bird.

901
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:54,260
How could you live with yourself?

902
01:06:55,140 --> 01:06:57,660
having a, uh, I'm having a great time.

903
01:06:58,140 --> 01:07:00,740
I got paid for doing my job.

904
01:07:01,220 --> 01:07:02,120
Damn it.

905
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:06,880
They got damp.

906
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:07,440
What?

907
01:07:08,460 --> 01:07:11,440
What do you mean told me?

908
01:07:12,020 --> 01:07:24,320
Um, I had to resupply and then check the quarantine and then
do and speed the TSA and then make sure everybody is

909
01:07:24,320 --> 01:07:24,940
healthy.

910
01:07:25,560 --> 01:07:25,900
What do you mean?

911
01:07:25,940 --> 01:07:32,000
I also have to make sure the fucking We put a lid on the
power.

912
01:07:35,040 --> 01:07:36,280
Oh, okay.

913
01:07:36,580 --> 01:07:37,620
The generator consumes fuel.

914
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:38,100
Be careful.

915
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:40,020
Mindful of each building consumes power.

916
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:41,840
An upgraded building will consume more power.

917
01:07:42,660 --> 01:07:44,100
Exceeding generator power.

918
01:07:46,080 --> 01:07:46,680
Alright.

919
01:07:47,080 --> 01:07:47,920
That's fine.

920
01:07:48,700 --> 01:07:49,620
It's fine.

921
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:51,100
I will just...

922
01:07:53,140 --> 01:07:53,640
What?

923
01:07:54,140 --> 01:07:54,740
What?

924
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:56,380
Say the magic words.

925
01:07:59,530 --> 01:08:00,190
Now move on.

926
01:08:00,330 --> 01:08:00,870
Alright.

927
01:08:02,010 --> 01:08:18,090
be light right did I do it oh it's right here wait what how
do I restart it

928
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:35,080
do I have to like walk there oh my god give me I gotta
fucking walk there too oh my Oh, hey, crazy, Dave.

929
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:37,740
Okay, there you go.

930
01:08:38,900 --> 01:08:40,020
Let that be live!

931
01:08:41,740 --> 01:08:42,560
Yep, that's me.

932
01:08:42,740 --> 01:08:43,660
You may be asking how...

933
01:08:43,660 --> 01:08:45,380
Here's a lock on this situation.

934
01:08:45,540 --> 01:08:46,960
Well, I'll start it, man.

935
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:49,180
That means more bodies and more pressure.

936
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:51,880
Don't let any straw break the camel's back.

937
01:08:52,280 --> 01:08:53,500
Okay, I have to upgrade the base.

938
01:08:54,160 --> 01:08:55,800
This is a lot smaller than I expected.

939
01:08:57,720 --> 01:08:58,100
Alright.

940
01:08:59,240 --> 01:09:00,620
Upgrade to level 2.

941
01:09:01,180 --> 01:09:01,380
Alright.

942
01:09:03,340 --> 01:09:03,980
upgrades.

943
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:09,460
Increasing the checkpoint levels, unlocks new tools and
upgrades, new tool upgrades, and building upgrades.

944
01:09:09,580 --> 01:09:14,880
You would need these upgrades to detect new symptoms more
easily and meet the demands for evacuation.

945
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:15,500
Alright?

946
01:09:16,260 --> 01:09:17,400
Tablet time.

947
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:21,000
Uh, upgrades.

948
01:09:21,380 --> 01:09:22,940
Okay, we gotta grab this.

949
01:09:24,100 --> 01:09:24,420
Improve.

950
01:09:25,280 --> 01:09:25,660
Bam.

951
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:27,640
But not so fast.

952
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:29,800
Now we need to deal with the generator.

953
01:09:30,360 --> 01:09:30,760
Huh?

954
01:09:31,820 --> 01:09:33,300
What about the generator?

955
01:09:33,320 --> 01:09:34,720
Return the base mode.

956
01:09:39,220 --> 01:09:41,180
But that's all my money.

957
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:44,400
But...

958
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:45,940
But I saved...

959
01:09:45,940 --> 01:09:49,600
I worked so hard saving all that money.

960
01:09:50,420 --> 01:09:51,560
Don't get caught, soldier.

961
01:09:52,020 --> 01:09:54,260
Everything in this camp requires power.

962
01:09:56,700 --> 01:09:57,640
It's more power.

963
01:09:58,100 --> 01:09:59,460
It worked so hard!

964
01:10:00,540 --> 01:10:02,420
Time to pay up.

965
01:10:02,780 --> 01:10:04,480
Time to pay your taxes.

966
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:22,820
all right oh my god all my money okay uh we have six nobody
is sick all right that's good we gotta buy more food though

967
01:10:22,820 --> 01:10:38,020
sadly oh my god i'm so poor wait where's the canteen Okay,
how much is one?

968
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:41,020
$60 per person?

969
01:10:44,060 --> 01:10:48,260
That just better be a mission than Mia for each goddamn
survivor.

970
01:10:48,380 --> 01:10:49,120
This is what I'm saying.

971
01:10:49,300 --> 01:10:50,720
I don't want more survivors.

972
01:10:51,460 --> 01:10:53,000
I met the quota already.

973
01:10:53,160 --> 01:10:54,460
I met the government quota.

974
01:10:56,040 --> 01:10:56,480
See this?

975
01:10:56,700 --> 01:10:58,680
It's usually used to test reflexes.

976
01:10:59,100 --> 01:11:00,800
The infected have slowed reactions.

977
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:02,940
You'll notice the difference right away.

978
01:11:03,640 --> 01:11:06,740
Bro, like, bro, where's my instant ramen?

979
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:10,680
Personally, I'd like to see a bat wrapped in barbed wire.

980
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:12,260
Eh, whatever.

981
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:13,520
Just be careful.

982
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:15,800
Don't go crack at any skulls.

983
01:11:15,980 --> 01:11:16,260
Alright.

984
01:11:17,300 --> 01:11:19,080
Jesus Christ, okay.

985
01:11:29,610 --> 01:11:30,210
Alright.

986
01:11:31,650 --> 01:11:35,750
Don't remember to not hit come in the head or torso.

987
01:11:37,410 --> 01:11:39,050
Alright, let's check on them.

988
01:11:40,090 --> 01:11:40,650
Verified.

989
01:11:41,590 --> 01:11:42,250
Quarantine status.

990
01:11:43,790 --> 01:11:45,070
No incidents reported.

991
01:11:45,830 --> 01:11:46,870
Give me a second.

992
01:11:47,710 --> 01:11:48,890
This is all too much.

993
01:11:49,570 --> 01:11:50,950
Well, I guess you can...

994
01:11:50,950 --> 01:11:53,490
Oh, she just only has yellow eyes.

995
01:11:54,390 --> 01:11:55,110
So...

996
01:11:56,580 --> 01:11:58,380
You know what?

997
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:03,440
Wait.

998
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:05,240
Is she react?

999
01:12:05,340 --> 01:12:06,500
That's reacting, right?

1000
01:12:08,440 --> 01:12:09,160
She...

1001
01:12:10,220 --> 01:12:11,820
She's reacting, right?

1002
01:12:15,380 --> 01:12:16,100
I

1003
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:24,620
think she's fine, right?

1004
01:12:25,820 --> 01:12:27,000
She just has yellow.

1005
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:27,680
Yellow.

1006
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:28,440
Oh, shit.

1007
01:12:35,680 --> 01:12:37,500
Oh, cross reflex.

1008
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:43,400
Oh, if she attacks me, no self-defense is allowed.

1009
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:49,280
Self-defense is not allowed here.

1010
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:52,380
I thought it was just yellow eyes.

1011
01:12:52,500 --> 01:12:53,180
I just noticed.

1012
01:12:53,200 --> 01:13:03,440
that i got that wrong then she should be fine right 36 and

01:13:57,720 --> 01:13:59,400
No, go back in there.

1018
01:13:59,480 --> 01:14:00,460
I don't trust you.

1019
01:14:03,020 --> 01:14:04,000
Yeah, I don't trust.

1020
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:05,140
Get back in there.

1021
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:07,320
You gotta be kidding me.

1022
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:08,780
Alright, your turn.

1023
01:14:10,100 --> 01:14:10,840
How about you?

1024
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:13,220
Oh, oh.

1025
01:14:13,420 --> 01:14:14,520
Sneezing time.

1026
01:14:15,220 --> 01:14:17,220
Still has Freckles.

1027
01:14:19,620 --> 01:14:20,260
Oh.

1028
01:14:21,980 --> 01:14:23,260
Has reflexes.

1029
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:27,260
3-6, 37, 38.

1030
01:14:27,660 --> 01:14:32,920
39, 40, 41, 42, 43.

1031
01:14:49,680 --> 01:14:54,360
Luckily, I hope it's not airborne.

1032
01:14:57,420 --> 01:14:58,680
Don't worry.

1033
01:14:59,240 --> 01:15:01,940
I'll make sure you'll be able to have plenty.

1034
01:15:02,240 --> 01:15:06,460
You'll be able to rest for a very, very long time.

1035
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:09,080
Very safe.

1036
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:12,800
We have a 100% success rate there.

1037
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:16,800

01:18:35,010 --> 01:18:37,350
He just has shitty reflexes.

1075
01:18:37,350 --> 01:18:45,310

He is aggressive.

1092
01:20:26,870 --> 01:20:30,690
Was a sign of zombies or, like, just that they're sick?

1093
01:20:31,630 --> 01:20:32,370
Oh, never mind.

1094

I marked it.

1105
01:21:55,020 --> 01:21:56,180
Yeah, I already marked the bite.

1106
01:21:56,380 --> 01:21:59,320
That's why I was like, oh, man, I have some bad news.

1107
01:22:01,640 --> 01:22:03,080
Step by step.

1108
01:22:04,040 --> 01:22:05,800
Does a zombie tell you to wear that, too?

1109
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:08,700
Alright, no.

1110
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:11,040
So what is...

1111
01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:12,240

1112
01:22:16,020 --> 01:22:16,500
What?

1113
01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:20,680
So was, like, Slackjawed, like, zombie, or what?

1114
01:22:23,100 --> 01:22:24,460
Because, uh...

1115
01:22:24,460 --> 01:22:26,020
She's just...

1116
01:22:30,310 --> 01:22:30,990
Bruises.

1117
01:22:35,190 --> 01:22:35,870
91.

1118
01:22:39,470 --> 01:22:43,910
No, I remember he said something, like, oh, Slackjawed means
something.

1119
01:22:44,390 --> 01:22:47,130
Means, like, zombie, or, like...

1120
01:22:47,130 --> 01:22:49,130
Or, I don't remember if it was, like, zombie or...

1121
01:22:51,470 --> 01:22:51,910
Or...

1122
01:22:51,910 --> 01:22:52,890
Or, uh...

1123
01:22:52,890 --> 01:22:53,490
Sick.

1124
01:22:53,630 --> 01:22:55,150
Or it could be zombie.

1125
01:22:57,010 --> 01:22:58,850
Yeah, but they said something about Slackjaw.

1126
01:22:59,250 --> 01:23:00,890
I don't remember what it was.

1127
01:23:05,640 --> 01:23:09,340
Oh, it means I have... Oh, Slackjaw means I have to check
for reflexes.

1128
01:23:09,380 --> 01:23:09,700
Okay.

1129
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:10,920
Alright.

1130
01:23:11,340 --> 01:23:13,500
I mean, she could have had a stroke, you know?

1131
01:23:15,460 --> 01:23:17,480
She could have had a stroke, guys.

1132
01:23:18,640 --> 01:23:19,520
She's old.

1133
01:23:19,940 --> 01:23:32,900
it's very stressful during the apocalypse I don't guys know
this but this apocalypse is pretty fucking stressful okay

1134
01:23:32,900 --> 01:23:48,060
well I think it's fine doesn't have any of the bad stuff
like you know like she doesn't have any cuts right yeah None

1135
01:23:48,060 --> 01:23:49,400
of the bad stuff.

1136
01:23:49,500 --> 01:23:51,600
She only has, like, the...

1137
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:52,560
You know...

1138
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:53,440
She's just old.

1139
01:23:54,860 --> 01:23:55,560
That's all.

1140
01:23:56,100 --> 01:23:57,120
I'm going to test it.

1141
01:23:57,200 --> 01:23:58,360
She just has that...

1142
01:23:58,360 --> 01:23:58,660
See?

1143
01:23:58,780 --> 01:23:59,620
She's just old.

1144
01:24:00,360 --> 01:24:02,280
Oh, that is my hammer.

1145
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:09,500
I think it's fine.

1146
01:24:09,620 --> 01:24:10,780
Alright, off to the...

1147
01:24:12,200 --> 01:24:12,800
Goodbye.

1148
01:24:14,220 --> 01:24:15,240
I am.

1149
01:24:15,720 --> 01:24:17,380
I am a hero.

1150
01:24:17,780 --> 01:24:26,700
Oh my god, a lot A lot of people have Oh Bro, what the fuck?

1151
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:36,980
Everybody's having a stroke these days During the zombie
apocalypse Okay, that's my hammer Oh man I have to like

1152
01:24:36,980 --> 01:24:46,240
upgrade my I have too many people now Living here Guys This
sucks

1153
01:24:49,360 --> 01:25:08,520
all right i have nine food oh i went beyond my quota yeah i
still have to take care of all these people all right 116 i

1154
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:19,340
just forget like temperature wise or like pulse wise okay
under 16 um tm welcome to tomato farm welcome I feel like

1155
01:25:19,340 --> 01:25:20,420
they could sleep on the floor.

1156
01:25:21,740 --> 01:25:22,640
It should be fine.

1157
01:25:25,200 --> 01:25:30,580
This lady has to be like the peak model survivor.

1158
01:25:31,120 --> 01:25:34,060
The only thing wrong with her is that she might have...

1159
01:25:34,060 --> 01:25:35,380
She has no reflexes.

1160
01:25:35,540 --> 01:25:36,420
Actually, no, never mind.

1161
01:25:36,500 --> 01:25:37,300
I think that's pretty bad.

1162
01:25:37,400 --> 01:25:43,160
I think you have to have reflexes and reaction time to
survive.

1163
01:25:43,540 --> 01:25:46,200
Okay, the only issue is that she might have had a stroke.

1164
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:48,160
But other than that, she's...

1165
01:25:48,180 --> 01:26:14,360
a perfect survivor all right that's really it that's just
one tiny problem point poor inspection oh no oh no oh that's

1166
01:26:14,360 --> 01:26:26,250
bad Why do none of them have any reflexes?

1167
01:26:30,250 --> 01:26:30,890
Oh, no.

1168
01:26:31,730 --> 01:26:34,010
What happened?

1169
01:26:37,330 --> 01:26:39,430
I checked everything.

1170
01:26:40,830 --> 01:26:41,110
What do you mean?

1171
01:26:41,150 --> 01:26:42,290
Poor inspection.

1172
01:26:46,530 --> 01:26:47,330
36.

1173
01:26:49,530 --> 01:26:50,330
91.

1174
01:26:50,710 --> 01:26:52,170

Quarantine status stable.

1188

01:29:23,900 --> 01:29:26,180
Yeah, no incidents reported, guys.

1190
01:29:27,420 --> 01:29:28,620
Not at all.

1191
01:29:29,100 --> 01:29:30,260
What's the point of all this?

1192
01:29:30,920 --> 01:29:31,900
We're all dead already.

1193
01:29:32,280 --> 01:29:33,300

01:29:41,980 --> 01:29:43,640
Oh, you're no longer...

01:29:43,640 --> 01:29:45,820

Oh, this is pretty awkward.

I mean, we could, we could, you know, maybe I gotta double
check, you know.

1261
01:35:05,540 --> 01:35:05,880
Oh.

1262
01:35:06,980 --> 01:35:08,540
Maybe it's just an arm thing.

1263
01:35:08,660 --> 01:35:10,080
Let's double check the...

1264
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:10,560

1268
01:35:31,720 --> 01:35:32,960
Bro, I thought we cool.

1269
01:35:37,340 --> 01:35:39,520
Okay, yeah, she has reflexes.

1270
01:35:40,900 --> 01:35:42,080
Okay, those are just me.

1271
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:44,180
Is that a...

1272
01:35:44,180 --> 01:35:44,520
No, she's...

1273
01:35:44,540 --> 01:35:45,420
She's just dirty.

1274
01:35:46,700 --> 01:35:48,120
And that's just me hitting her arm.

1275
01:35:49,200 --> 01:35:51,880
I swear to God if I miss a hidden bite mark.

1276
01:35:52,460 --> 01:35:53,660
Like, bro, that's not cool, bro.

1277
01:35:53,760 --> 01:35:54,840
I thought we cool.

1278
01:35:55,680 --> 01:35:57,460
I thought we chill like that, bro.

1279
01:35:59,140 --> 01:35:59,860
There he says.

1280
01:36:00,180 --> 01:36:02,460
Well, she seems very healthy.

1281
01:36:04,380 --> 01:36:06,760
Like, she seems like the model citizen.

1282
01:36:08,400 --> 01:36:11,020
But the last time I said that.

1283
01:36:13,180 --> 01:36:13,660
Okay.

1284
01:36:14,540 --> 01:36:15,960
No cuts or bruises.

1285
01:36:16,260 --> 01:36:16,360
Nope.

1286
01:36:18,180 --> 01:36:20,540
Don't see any cuts nor bruises here.

1287
01:36:21,500 --> 01:36:22,820
I'm looking everywhere.

1288
01:36:23,220 --> 01:36:26,280
Well, this time, guys.

1289
01:36:27,780 --> 01:36:31,700
This time, she is a model survivor.

1290
01:36:32,240 --> 01:36:36,400
She has no freckles, no bruises, no cuts, no bite marks.

1291
01:36:36,880 --> 01:36:38,080
Her eyes seem okay.

1292
01:36:38,260 --> 01:36:39,760
Her reflexes are gray.

1293
01:36:40,420 --> 01:36:43,460
And she is not sick whatsoever.

1294
01:36:44,540 --> 01:36:45,820
Just to be sure.

1295
01:36:49,480 --> 01:36:49,840
Yep.

1296
01:36:51,060 --> 01:36:51,660
Just right.

1297
01:36:52,860 --> 01:36:55,380
Now she should be okay.

1298
01:36:56,240 --> 01:36:57,780
Yeah, excellent inspection.

1299
01:36:58,020 --> 01:36:59,220
I knew it was excellent.

1300
01:37:00,060 --> 01:37:01,760
I think I need to buy more food again.

1301
01:37:02,200 --> 01:37:03,300
Oh, I'm so broke.

1302
01:37:03,660 --> 01:37:05,660
I'm not okay.

1303
01:37:06,140 --> 01:37:06,900
I...

1304
01:37:06,900 --> 01:37:09,880
Oh, I need more food.

1305
01:37:10,360 --> 01:37:11,980
Where is the food?

1306
01:37:12,800 --> 01:37:13,860
Oh, there it is.

1307
01:37:14,320 --> 01:37:15,620

Alright, yep, she's just hyper-aggressive.

1311
01:37:56,360 --> 01:37:57,860
Alright, get in that quarantine.

1312
01:37:58,900 --> 01:38:00,960

1313
01:38:01,060 --> 01:38:01,320

What the fuck?

1317
01:38:07,760 --> 01:38:09,260
Where did he come from?

1318
01:38:10,700 --> 01:38:12,800
I thought I was like, zombie!

1319
01:38:15,300 --> 01:38:16,540
Oh my god.

1320
01:38:17,260 --> 01:38:18,480
I thought that was a zombie.

1321
01:38:18,520 --> 01:38:20,360
That actually jump scared me.

1322
01:38:20,680 --> 01:38:21,860

1324
01:38:28,360 --> 01:38:30,800
Legitimately thought I was a zombie right there.

1325
01:38:31,480 --> 01:38:32,960
A poorly geared zombie.

1326
01:38:36,980 --> 01:38:37,620
136.

1327
01:38:38,960 --> 01:38:40,320
Well, she seems fine.

1328
01:38:42,380 --> 01:38:44,000
She just has a little bruise there.

1329
01:38:45,880 --> 01:38:47,360
Is that cut, too?

1330
01:38:48,280 --> 01:38:48,500
No.

1331
01:38:48,520 --> 01:38:59,620
She's just a little bruise Yeah, she invaded my personal

01:39:37,140 --> 01:39:49,840
that yeah but whose blood is it reflexes seem good all right
is that bruise Or she's just yellow.

1336
01:39:53,970 --> 01:40:01,450
I don't know about her.

1337
01:40:04,430 --> 01:40:06,730
Her pulses seem fine.

1338
01:40:07,730 --> 01:40:09,650
But like...

1339
01:40:09,650 --> 01:40:12,230
I can't tell these are cuts or not.

1340
01:40:13,010 --> 01:40:16,350
Like, are those from herself or like someone else?

1341
01:40:18,090 --> 01:40:20,090
Oh my gosh, already got how she turns.

1342
01:40:20,470 --> 01:40:21,830
Serena, God.

1343
01:40:24,030 --> 01:40:26,010
I'm double checking if there's butts.

1344
01:40:27,350 --> 01:40:29,930
I don't have enough space in quarantine, though.

1345
01:40:30,390 --> 01:40:31,170
It's full.

1346
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:37,880
I can't tell.

1347
01:40:38,180 --> 01:40:39,960
Like, I need her to take a shower.

1348
01:40:40,940 --> 01:40:46,900
How am I supposed to give a proper examination if, like,
that's just blood?

1349
01:40:54,060 --> 01:40:55,240
Like, oh, man.

1350
01:40:55,340 --> 01:40:56,000
I don't know.

1351
01:40:56,460 --> 01:40:57,060
Is she...

1352
01:40:58,320 --> 01:41:07,080
Like, I can't like that's just that's not bruise she's just
yellow over there like her neck is just yellow for some

1353
01:41:07,080 --> 01:41:09,940
reason uh

1354
01:41:13,760 --> 01:41:23,540
like is that your blood or not lady this would help me so
much if you could let me know if this blood is yours or not

1355
01:41:23,540 --> 01:41:26,240
like that would be so helpful right now

1356
01:41:29,280 --> 01:41:31,860
She had to kill to get here.

1357
01:41:32,060 --> 01:41:33,280
Let her in.

1358
01:41:35,660 --> 01:41:38,320
She worked so hard to get here.

1359
01:41:39,140 --> 01:41:40,440
No, it's not a cut.

1360
01:41:40,580 --> 01:41:41,420
I'm pretty sure.

1361
01:41:42,240 --> 01:41:42,840
I mean, it's not.

1362
01:41:42,920 --> 01:41:43,800
Is that a bite?

1363
01:41:47,290 --> 01:41:49,310
But that is so hard to see.

1364
01:41:50,210 --> 01:41:51,750
It doesn't look like a bite.

1365
01:41:55,860 --> 01:41:57,600
I can't check them out.

1366
01:41:58,020 --> 01:41:59,160
They're not healed yet.

1367
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:01,300
They're still fucked up.

1368
01:42:08,470 --> 01:42:09,970
Yeah, I can't tell.

1369
01:42:12,870 --> 01:42:16,350
There's no cuts on her, except for, like, there's no cuts on
her, actually.

1370
01:42:21,960 --> 01:42:24,060
Alright, let's check the quarantine real quick.

1371
01:42:28,560 --> 01:42:30,220
It's him that I put in.

1372
01:42:30,980 --> 01:42:32,760
He's been in there for two days.

1373
01:42:34,580 --> 01:42:36,500
And I don't know if I can trust it.

1374
01:42:40,050 --> 01:42:41,770
Oh my god, this one is hard.

1375
01:42:43,530 --> 01:42:51,090
I can't tell if it's dried blood or like a bite It's like
the bite the blood is really hiding it really good.

Wait, is that yellow eyes or...

1403
01:44:56,670 --> 01:44:58,030
No, it's yellow eyes.

1404
01:44:58,890 --> 01:45:00,330
Okay, yellow eyes.

1405
01:45:01,790 --> 01:45:03,870
Alright, why don't you want me to scan you?

1406

167.

1408
01:45:14,660 --> 01:45:15,180
Hmm.

1409
01:45:20,880 --> 01:45:21,600
Ooh.

1410
01:45:22,580 --> 01:45:24,280
I mean, if you have a fever, you just...

1411
01:45:24,280 --> 01:45:25,260
Oh, my God.

1412
01:45:25,400 --> 01:45:25,640
Wait.

1413
01:45:27,020 --> 01:45:28,200
This is bad.

1414
01:45:32,180 --> 01:45:32,820
Oh.

1415
01:45:34,320 --> 01:45:35,360
Oh.

1416
01:45:35,760 --> 01:45:37,520
Identification verified.

1417
01:45:38,240 --> 01:45:39,880
Quarantine status stable.

1418
01:45:40,500 --> 01:45:41,960
No incidents reported.

1419
01:45:42,100 --> 01:45:43,200
This guy?

1420
01:45:44,020 --> 01:45:45,660
Do you want me to release him?

1421
01:45:47,220 --> 01:45:49,000
Let's just get this over with.

1422
01:45:49,280 --> 01:45:51,140
But his pulse is so high.

1423
01:46:05,720 --> 01:46:06,200
He's just...

1424
01:46:06,200 --> 01:46:07,040
I swear to God.

1425
01:46:07,200 --> 01:46:10,460
If I lose my money, I swear to God.

1426
01:46:11,560 --> 01:46:13,980
Maybe he's just really stressed out.

1427
01:46:14,320 --> 01:46:16,580
I swear to God, guys.

1428
01:46:16,980 --> 01:46:18,940
If I lose my money because...

1429
01:46:18,940 --> 01:46:20,300
I do have 12 survivors.

1430
01:46:20,600 --> 01:46:22,560
So, like, at best he'll just kill three.

1431
01:46:24,600 --> 01:46:26,020
Like, at best.

1432
01:46:34,420 --> 01:46:35,940
Oh my god, everybody's sick.

1433
01:46:37,860 --> 01:46:40,520
You're gonna kill Crazy Dave.

1434
01:46:41,140 --> 01:46:41,500
No!

1435
01:46:42,500 --> 01:46:43,640
Crazy Dave!

1436
01:46:44,520 --> 01:46:47,020
That's okay, Crazy Dave is too crazy.

1437
01:46:47,160 --> 01:46:47,660
He'll live.

1438
01:46:48,600 --> 01:46:48,820
Alright.

1439
01:46:49,860 --> 01:46:51,940
Beds don't grow on trees here, soldier.

1440
01:46:52,680 --> 01:46:54,800
Can't keep people in the survivors block forever.

1441
01:46:55,700 --> 01:46:56,160
Evacuate.

1442
01:47:00,990 --> 01:47:01,950
Oh, okay.

1443
01:47:02,150 --> 01:47:02,550
Let's go.

1444
01:47:03,450 --> 01:47:04,470
Let's move them out.

1445
01:47:05,770 --> 01:47:08,770
All right, we got, we got, we hit the quota.

1446
01:47:09,830 --> 01:47:11,910
Start evacuation now.

1447
01:47:15,250 --> 01:47:16,410
Survivors cannot stay.

1448
01:47:16,850 --> 01:47:19,530
The science mission need all the help they can get.

1449
01:47:20,210 --> 01:47:24,070
Go to a science game where we select survivors to go to the
military for extra cash.

1450
01:47:24,190 --> 01:47:24,650
Remember your quota.

1451
01:47:24,770 --> 01:47:28,610
If you don't have enough survivors sent out, you are
jeopardizing the official mission.

1452
01:47:30,830 --> 01:47:31,310
Uh.

1453
01:47:39,220 --> 01:47:39,740
Okay.

1454
01:47:40,420 --> 01:47:50,460
money we gotta keep crazy Dave we gotta keep crazy Dave

1455
01:47:56,780 --> 01:48:11,660
science money science Money, science, money, science.

1456
01:48:11,660 --> 01:48:13,700
Money, science.

1457
01:48:15,700 --> 01:48:19,280
Yeah, but then I could get money and science.

1458
01:48:19,820 --> 01:48:22,000
Money, science.

1459
01:48:23,160 --> 01:48:26,520
And then, money.

1460
01:48:28,880 --> 01:48:29,460
Wait.

1461
01:48:31,060 --> 01:48:31,740
Money.

1462
01:48:33,560 --> 01:48:34,240
Yay!

1463
01:48:38,920 --> 01:48:40,280
And evacuation.

1464
01:48:41,920 --> 01:48:43,840
Crazy Dave, you live here forever.

1465
01:48:44,380 --> 01:48:45,620
I hope it went smoothly.

1466
01:48:46,460 --> 01:48:47,820
The report will come tomorrow morning.

1467
01:48:48,200 --> 01:48:49,800
Yeah, I got my quota.

1468
01:48:50,380 --> 01:48:51,000
Yippee!

1469
01:48:59,680 --> 01:49:00,760
Oh, you're right.

1470
01:49:00,980 --> 01:49:02,040
Less people to feed.

1471
01:49:03,540 --> 01:49:04,340
Okay, maintenance.

1472
01:49:05,180 --> 01:49:05,440
Yeah!

1473
01:49:05,780 --> 01:49:07,280
Oh my god, so much money!

1474
01:49:09,080 --> 01:49:10,720
And zero deaths!

1475
01:49:12,880 --> 01:49:13,140
Okay.

1476
01:49:14,820 --> 01:49:15,880
Nice work, buddy.

1477
01:49:16,480 --> 01:49:18,480
Remember, quotas are our main mission.

1478
01:49:18,940 --> 01:49:23,980
If we failed them a couple of times, and let's just say they
won't be sending us to quarantine.

1479
01:49:25,940 --> 01:49:27,800
Anyway, we've got lots of work in us.

1480
01:49:28,060 --> 01:49:28,540
What's that?

1481
01:49:28,800 --> 01:49:29,040
Come see me.

1482
01:49:29,780 --> 01:49:30,120
Okay.

1483
01:49:31,020 --> 01:49:31,780
What is it?

1484
01:49:34,540 --> 01:49:35,940
What is that?

1485
01:49:37,760 --> 01:49:42,080
Oh All right, we all signed a consent form, right?

1486
01:49:42,620 --> 01:49:43,800

1487

This is fine.

1488
01:49:44,780 --> 01:49:48,800

01:50:11,030 --> 01:50:13,470
They signed she signed a consent form.

1492
01:50:13,890 --> 01:50:15,430

At least it seems to have more guards.

1497
01:50:56,990 --> 01:50:58,730
Well, um...

You know, I'm just double checking for new new Doki Lan.

01:53:18,840 --> 01:53:20,700
Alright, are there any green people?

1523
01:53:43,640 --> 01:53:54,020
her radiation poisoning but like or the or the safe haven
you know she seems fine.

1524
01:53:54,140 --> 01:53:55,360
I don't see no bite marks.

1525
01:53:55,620 --> 01:53:55,940
I don't know.

1526
01:53:56,020 --> 01:53:56,880
Now I'm paranoid.

1527
01:53:58,460 --> 01:54:02,080
Now, guys, I'm just making sure there's no bite marks, guys.

1528
01:54:02,640 --> 01:54:03,880
I am very...

1529
01:54:03,880 --> 01:54:06,640
I'm just... Her ass is flat, though.

1530
01:54:07,260 --> 01:54:07,560
Okay.

1531
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:09,360
Those are... Oh, my God.

1532
01:54:09,420 --> 01:54:11,560
That is a fucked up bruise, though.

1533
01:54:11,580 --> 01:54:12,980
I will have to say.

1534
01:54:14,860 --> 01:54:15,740
Back of her leg?

1535
01:54:16,160 --> 01:54:16,980
That's not nothing.

1536
01:54:17,160 --> 01:54:17,580
It's just...

1537
01:54:18,820 --> 01:54:20,140
Nah, there's nothing there.

1538
01:54:23,830 --> 01:54:26,690
It's just her really fucked up bruise.

1539
01:54:28,210 --> 01:54:31,610
Uh, yeah, that, no, that's just a, that's just a red bruise.

1540
01:54:31,730 --> 01:54:34,010
It could potentially mean infected, though.

1541
01:54:34,070 --> 01:54:34,950
It does say that.

1542
01:54:35,030 --> 01:54:37,070
Well, just to make sure.

1543
01:54:41,930 --> 01:54:43,230
Now she's fine there.

1544
01:54:46,600 --> 01:54:48,080
She just has an elevated pulse.

1545
01:54:48,320 --> 01:54:48,520
Alright.

1546
01:54:49,220 --> 01:54:50,340
Elevated pulse.

1547
01:54:51,700 --> 01:54:52,180
Alright.

1548
01:54:52,320 --> 01:54:53,800
Good reflexes.

1549
01:54:55,620 --> 01:54:57,180
And, I guess that's it.

1550
01:54:57,500 --> 01:54:59,580
I don't think she has any cussing.

1551
01:54:59,600 --> 01:55:07,520
or bruises when i did the examination i mean she okay no she
has a john ass bruise here but other than that other than

1552
01:55:07,520 --> 01:55:23,860
that i just have to quarantine her all right get in there
all right he's pale oh oh look into my eyes oh no reflex all

1553
01:55:23,860 --> 01:55:30,420
right absent reflex yellow eyes Oh, wait.

1554
01:55:32,160 --> 01:55:32,740
Pell skin.

1555
01:55:34,640 --> 01:55:35,600
Potentially infected.

1556
01:55:39,700 --> 01:55:40,240
Oops, sorry.

1557
01:55:40,500 --> 01:55:41,480
I was trying to scan.

1558
01:55:43,080 --> 01:55:43,920
Holy shit.

1559
01:55:44,760 --> 01:55:46,740
Oh, did a fucking cinder block fell on?

1560
01:55:46,800 --> 01:55:48,000
Bro, what the fuck?

1561
01:55:48,880 --> 01:55:51,060
There's so many problems, man.

1562
01:55:55,170 --> 01:55:56,170
I do think...

1563
01:55:56,170 --> 01:55:57,030
Oh, hey, grippers.

1564
01:55:57,970 --> 01:56:00,310
I do think this man might need to see a doctor.

1565
01:56:01,090 --> 01:56:02,110
But, like...

1566
01:56:04,330 --> 01:56:11,570
but like I cannot really do much about sorry buddy you have
a lot of things wrong with you and I know you really want to

1567
01:56:11,570 --> 01:56:31,930
see a doctor right now but like oh I just oh man I guess
I'll take you to quarantine all right come on can I just go

1568
01:56:31,930 --> 01:56:58,810
you here like like um like i don't i don't know maybe you
think we'll chop uh that's necrosis oh oh your eyes all

1569
01:56:58,810 --> 01:57:07,210
right all right there's that too all right um a plus for
Confidence, though.

1570
01:57:07,290 --> 01:57:08,930
Let me see if I can find the bite mark.

1571
01:57:12,010 --> 01:57:15,050
I assume that's where the bite mark is.

1572
01:57:15,390 --> 01:57:20,350
I assume that's where it is, and it's just progressed
progressed more and more.

1573
01:57:21,310 --> 01:57:23,870
Because, like, oh my god, I don't know.

1574
01:57:24,130 --> 01:57:25,470
Maybe she's blind?

1575
01:57:30,490 --> 01:57:32,790
Maybe, maybe she was blind.

1576
01:57:33,510 --> 01:57:33,530
It could be worse.

1577
01:57:34,310 --> 01:57:36,270
It could be, you're right, it could be worse.

1578
01:57:36,290 --> 01:57:37,410
It could be worse.

1579
01:57:38,270 --> 01:57:38,750
Oh, man.

1580
01:57:40,870 --> 01:57:42,950
Oh, my God.

1581
01:57:45,050 --> 01:57:45,650
Girl.

1582
01:57:47,290 --> 01:57:50,510
You need a doctor right now.

1583
01:57:52,610 --> 01:57:53,850
Oh, my God.

1584
01:57:54,410 --> 01:57:56,470
How many fingers am I holding?

1585
01:57:57,190 --> 01:57:59,530
I'm just going to do the scan first, just in case.

1586
01:58:01,230 --> 01:58:03,690
Just in case I see a giant-ass bite mark in my face.

1587
01:58:04,370 --> 01:58:05,610
Glasses and gloves.

I mean, it could be a huge birthmark.

1591
01:58:43,520 --> 01:58:43,880
You're right.

1592
01:58:46,500 --> 01:58:47,620
Well, goodbye.

01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:55,500
Don't worry.

1596
01:58:55,680 --> 01:58:56,140
Don't worry.

1597
01:58:56,880 --> 01:58:58,780
That's where our doctors are.

1598
01:59:03,660 --> 01:59:04,780
That is...

1599
01:59:04,780 --> 01:59:05,240

1600
01:59:05,460 --> 01:59:06,440

Let's see if the zombie bit his feet.

1613

See if the zombie is a little bit, like, ginky.

1614
02:00:51,940 --> 02:00:54,300
Cuts normally have blood around them.

1615
02:00:54,380 --> 02:00:55,920
Nope, just regular blood.

1616
02:00:57,100 --> 02:00:58,960
You are in a quarantine zone.

1617
02:00:59,400 --> 02:01:00,800

The peak male physique right here.

02:01:30,860 --> 02:01:32,460
You're not even green.

Isn't that great?

1629
02:01:37,620 --> 02:01:39,160
I'll be okay, right?

1630
02:01:39,960 --> 02:01:39,960
Yeah.

1631
02:01:40,120 --> 02:01:40,680
Are you sure?

1632
02:01:41,920 --> 02:01:43,620
You're not even green.

1633
02:01:45,940 --> 02:01:47,420
My kids just made it through yesterday.

1634
02:01:47,700 --> 02:01:49,700
How do they keep telling me their kids are here?

1635
02:01:52,960 --> 02:01:53,820
Okay, hurry.

1636
02:01:54,040 --> 02:01:55,040
Eyes are yellow.

1637
02:01:56,620 --> 02:01:57,520
Yellow eyes.

1638
02:02:05,180 --> 02:02:07,360

1643
02:02:41,750 --> 02:02:44,450
She just didn't use sunscreen, I guess?

1644
02:02:46,030 --> 02:02:46,770
Yeah.

1645
02:02:47,930 --> 02:02:49,010
Is that pale?

1646
02:02:52,550 --> 02:02:55,260
I can't tell she's pale or just like...

1647
02:02:58,050 --> 02:02:59,650
I can't tell.

1648
02:03:06,750 --> 02:03:07,370
Pale...

1649
02:03:07,370 --> 02:03:09,090
That is not a red bruise.

1650
02:03:09,930 --> 02:03:12,030
The red bruise is like really fucked up.

Is she good?

1656
02:03:59,430 --> 02:04:01,370
Stay calm and wait for your turn.

1657
02:04:02,250 --> 02:04:03,410
Is that pale skin?

1658
02:04:05,690 --> 02:04:10,250
I can't tell if she just doesn't go in the sun.

1659
02:04:14,960 --> 02:04:18,520
Like, no, is there actually red skin here?

1660
02:04:18,640 --> 02:04:18,900
No.

1661
02:04:19,500 --> 02:04:20,400

Alright, that's new.

1664
02:04:23,700 --> 02:04:24,620
I didn't see that.

1665
02:04:26,840 --> 02:04:28,600
All their symptoms are just fine.

1666
02:04:31,300 --> 02:04:31,900
Alright.

1667
02:04:32,920 --> 02:04:34,700
Well, she's just sick, I guess.

1668
02:04:35,880 --> 02:04:37,160
I put it in quarantine.

1669
02:04:37,360 --> 02:04:38,460
I don't have enough space.

1670
02:04:40,660 --> 02:04:43,100
I don't like how he's just standing there.

1671
02:04:48,880 --> 02:04:49,400

1672
02:04:53,200 --> 02:04:54,480
I mean...

1673
02:04:54,480 --> 02:04:55,580
Do we risk it?

1674
02:04:59,830 --> 02:05:01,050
Can I upgrade quarantine?

1675
02:05:01,110 --> 02:05:01,470

1676
02:05:01,570 --> 02:05:02,050
Let me check.

1677
02:05:02,310 --> 02:05:03,770
I actually don't know if I have enough money.

1678
02:05:07,290 --> 02:05:07,690
Oh, nice.

dead if he shows up, send him straight to quarantine.

One day, I swear to God, one day we're gonna find a bite
mark on those toes.

1747
02:09:12,760 --> 02:09:15,280
We gotta make sure the zombie ain't a freak.

02:09:26,020 --> 02:09:28,300
He literally is like...

1753
02:09:28,300 --> 02:09:29,820
He's not fucking...

1754
02:09:29,820 --> 02:09:31,980
Like, he found a shower somehow.

1755
02:09:32,100 --> 02:09:34,120
And found a way to work out.

1756
02:09:38,460 --> 02:09:38,800
Alright.

1757
02:09:40,140 --> 02:09:41,340
Excellent inspection.

1758
02:09:43,220 --> 02:09:44,340

Yeah, do you think this?

1770
02:10:40,980 --> 02:10:43,840
Gosh, I don't know.

1771
02:10:45,540 --> 02:10:48,600
I don't know if this is a personal item or not.

1772
02:10:49,580 --> 02:10:51,880
Maybe it's to light up the fish.

1773
02:10:52,220 --> 02:10:53,040
Got the sausage.

1774
02:10:53,680 --> 02:10:54,160
You know?

1775
02:10:55,240 --> 02:10:58,660
Is he to light up the sausage to cook it exactly?

1776
02:11:00,940 --> 02:11:03,080
Is that knife considered a weapon?

1777
02:11:03,400 --> 02:11:04,840
Or is that just...

1778
02:11:04,840 --> 02:11:07,780
Like, that's obviously to cut the fish.

1779
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:08,640
But is that...

1780
02:11:11,760 --> 02:11:13,340
What is that an onion?

1781
02:11:15,880 --> 02:11:17,380
Is onion not good?

1782
02:11:21,680 --> 02:11:24,660
Alright, what about metal?

1783
02:11:25,940 --> 02:11:28,180
Because it's confiscating a metal can.

1784
02:11:30,960 --> 02:11:31,220
What?

1785
02:11:33,280 --> 02:11:34,880
That counts?

1786
02:11:35,660 --> 02:11:36,480
It's a pan!

1787
02:11:36,600 --> 02:11:37,520
That's a weapon!

1788
02:11:39,240 --> 02:11:40,260
Does this count?

1789
02:11:41,680 --> 02:11:47,620
But, frying pans, that's what I learned in chicken, winner,
winner, chicken dinner.

1790
02:11:47,840 --> 02:11:50,440
In a quarantine zone, stay calm and wait.

1791
02:11:50,440 --> 02:11:51,220
What about this?

1792
02:11:51,880 --> 02:11:55,540
Remove your outer clothing, hats, glasses, and gloves.

1793
02:11:55,680 --> 02:11:58,340
Because they confiscated a fucking soda.

1794
02:12:02,380 --> 02:12:05,340
Yeah, but what about the soda can?

1795
02:12:05,980 --> 02:12:08,840
It depends on if the game is said in the UK or not.

1796
02:12:08,840 --> 02:12:10,460
Thank you for the super chat.

1797
02:12:10,700 --> 02:12:10,920
Thank you.

1798
02:12:10,920 --> 02:12:11,980
Thank you, Lolly.

1799
02:12:14,660 --> 02:12:15,780
Oh, alcohol.

1800
02:12:16,260 --> 02:12:16,840
Oh, okay.

1801
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:17,780
Yeah, you're fine.

1802
02:12:18,020 --> 02:12:19,080
This is fine, then.

1803
02:12:20,560 --> 02:12:22,240
Alright, you can keep all that.

1804
02:12:23,620 --> 02:12:26,600
It'd be funny if I find a fucking bite after all that shit.

1805
02:12:31,180 --> 02:12:31,940
One day.

1806
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:35,040
One day I will find a zombie bite on the toes.

1807
02:12:36,240 --> 02:12:39,560
One day I will find a freaky zombie.

1808
02:12:44,180 --> 02:12:46,540
A freaky ass on me.

1809
02:12:47,660 --> 02:12:48,860
He seems fine.

1810
02:12:49,380 --> 02:12:51,300
No bite marks so far.

1811
02:12:54,240 --> 02:12:55,080
Wait, what's your name?

1812
02:12:56,460 --> 02:12:57,320
Whoops, not that.

1813
02:12:58,800 --> 02:12:59,440
Ironed.

1814
02:13:03,680 --> 02:13:04,320
Alright.

1815
02:13:10,390 --> 02:13:10,810
Fine.

1816
02:13:12,050 --> 02:13:13,910
No, he's just wearing yoga pants.

1817
02:13:15,970 --> 02:13:16,950
Everything seems okay.

1818
02:13:17,070 --> 02:13:20,010
I swear to God, there's a bite mark right in the inside of
your thighs.

1819
02:13:20,070 --> 02:13:22,370
Because you are like...

1820
02:13:22,370 --> 02:13:24,090
Like you were asking to be bit.

1821
02:13:28,310 --> 02:13:29,530
You were...

1822
02:13:29,530 --> 02:13:30,570
Yeah, you were...

1823
02:13:30,570 --> 02:13:32,970
You were 100% asking to be bit there.

1824
02:13:36,030 --> 02:13:36,710
Oh?

1825
02:13:39,210 --> 02:13:41,830
He has weapon and back.

1826
02:13:41,950 --> 02:13:42,330
Weapon.

1827
02:13:43,610 --> 02:13:43,930
Alright.

1828
02:13:47,420 --> 02:13:48,460
Let's go.

1829
02:13:49,720 --> 02:13:50,760
Grab your items.

1830
02:13:53,140 --> 02:13:55,960
All right, let me look at your backpack.

1831
02:13:56,540 --> 02:13:58,000
God, this is so elaborate now.

1832
02:13:59,800 --> 02:14:00,500
Just cough.

1833
02:14:01,280 --> 02:14:01,780
Just cough.

1834
02:14:02,880 --> 02:14:02,900
Oh.

1835
02:14:05,720 --> 02:14:06,360
Watch out.

1836
02:14:08,100 --> 02:14:09,160
Oh, thank you, man.

1837
02:14:09,840 --> 02:14:09,920
Oh.

1838
02:14:17,080 --> 02:14:18,320
He's Chinese.

1839
02:14:18,720 --> 02:14:19,620
He spoke Chinese.

1840
02:14:20,580 --> 02:14:20,840
Whoa.

1841
02:14:21,820 --> 02:14:28,500
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, don't worry, buddy, I didn't,

1842
02:14:28,920 --> 02:14:29,960
what the fuck?

1843
02:14:30,840 --> 02:14:31,920
A toofer?

1844
02:14:32,700 --> 02:14:34,200
All right, okay, buddy.

1845
02:14:38,260 --> 02:14:45,760
I swear to you, guys, I found a third, but, oh, how are you
walking?

1846
02:14:46,580 --> 02:14:48,480
Wait, maybe he's immune.

1847
02:14:49,760 --> 02:14:51,680
Wait, wait, are you Solomon?

1848
02:14:51,820 --> 02:14:53,340
Remove your outer clothing.

1849
02:14:53,620 --> 02:14:55,700
Has glasses and gloves.

1850
02:14:55,840 --> 02:14:56,600
You should...

1851
02:15:00,620 --> 02:15:01,020
Wait.

1852
02:15:02,160 --> 02:15:03,080
Is this Solomon?

1853
02:15:05,380 --> 02:15:07,200
Wait, that could be him.

1854
02:15:07,300 --> 02:15:08,680
He got three bites.

1855
02:15:09,060 --> 02:15:12,800
One, two, three.

1856
02:15:13,720 --> 02:15:15,880
It's just that his name is Chinese.

1857
02:15:16,940 --> 02:15:17,580
Is this one?

1858
02:15:19,280 --> 02:15:20,240
Oh, wait.

1859
02:15:20,320 --> 02:15:21,520
That's a fourth bite.

1860
02:15:21,820 --> 02:15:26,540
Uh, they never told me about the fourth fight guy.

1861
02:15:29,160 --> 02:15:31,060
Maybe, I don't know this kid.

1862
02:15:31,300 --> 02:15:33,540
Maybe it's Solomon in Chinese.

1863
02:15:37,640 --> 02:15:43,040
Okay, nobody, oh, bro, nobody told me about the fourth.

1864
02:15:43,160 --> 02:15:45,720
I can't even tap this four times.

1865
02:15:48,080 --> 02:15:51,600
Guys, I don't know if you saw them in no more.

1866
02:15:51,820 --> 02:15:54,800
They said three, not four bites.

1867
02:15:56,760 --> 02:15:59,320
Guys, I told you, I can't read Chinese.

1868
02:15:59,660 --> 02:16:01,460
I can only speak and listen.

1869
02:16:04,920 --> 02:16:05,660
He's got one.

1870
02:16:05,700 --> 02:16:08,980
Oh, yeah, he came over here with the four bites.

1871
02:16:09,480 --> 02:16:13,780
Three in a row.

1872
02:16:14,060 --> 02:16:16,000
Go for one more.

1873
02:16:16,500 --> 02:16:19,860
The bites just cancel each other out.

1874

02:18:35,960 --> 02:18:37,220
Those are freckles, right?

1889
02:18:39,180 --> 02:18:40,580
Yeah, they are.

1890
02:18:43,280 --> 02:18:44,740
Oh, my God, that is him.

1891
02:18:44,900 --> 02:18:46,720
Alright, go to quarantine, Solomon.

1892

02:18:59,500 --> 02:19:00,760
What the fuck is that?

1897
02:19:02,660 --> 02:19:03,540
Don't take it.

1898
02:19:03,720 --> 02:19:04,000
Oh.

1899
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:05,420
It's all I have left of my mom.

1900
02:19:06,500 --> 02:19:06,880
Oh.

1901
02:19:07,320 --> 02:19:08,200
Her blood?

1902
02:19:09,720 --> 02:19:10,720
Wait, that's onion!

1903
02:19:13,180 --> 02:19:13,780
Whoops.

1904
02:19:15,200 --> 02:19:16,700
The onion's in there.

1905
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:19,340
Wait, how is onion contraband, guys?

1906
02:19:27,150 --> 02:19:29,150
Or garlic, garlic, garlic.

1907
02:19:29,390 --> 02:19:30,810
How is garlic contraband?

1908
02:19:38,670 --> 02:19:52,910

1909
02:19:52,910 --> 02:20:04,230
categorized as a contraband like and also a biohazard but
yet for some reason kill her anyway so why would i lose

1910
02:20:04,230 --> 02:20:13,690
money for that like if we're gonna kill her anyway i should
not be losing money for for this shit this is your eye it's

1913
02:20:30,250 --> 02:20:33,770
The colic is just to be used for skill.

1914
02:20:34,690 --> 02:20:36,210
That's fucking crazy.

1915
02:20:46,680 --> 02:20:49,200
Bro, I'm going to put some science points on.

1916
02:20:50,260 --> 02:20:51,080
On the range.

1917
02:20:51,160 --> 02:20:53,260
I don't like how little range this is.

1918
02:20:54,040 --> 02:20:55,080
I'm science-ing.

1919
02:20:58,960 --> 02:21:00,840
How much larger is it?

1920
02:21:00,920 --> 02:21:01,860
Oh, yeah, there you go.

1921
02:21:02,020 --> 02:21:02,580
a lot better.

1922
02:21:09,740 --> 02:21:11,560
She doesn't have any cuts.

1923
02:21:11,960 --> 02:21:13,880
She's just really fucked up.

1924
02:21:16,580 --> 02:21:17,120
What is it?

1925
02:21:17,700 --> 02:21:18,480
Oh, red bruise.

1926
02:21:18,600 --> 02:21:20,180
Okay, we still have to send you to quarantine.

1927
02:21:20,920 --> 02:21:22,040
You're very fucked up.

1928
02:21:22,380 --> 02:21:23,780
Alright, next person, please.

1929
02:21:25,640 --> 02:21:26,080
Alright.

1930
02:21:27,040 --> 02:21:27,480
Competent.

1931
02:21:27,620 --> 02:21:28,280
Come on.

1932
02:21:28,820 --> 02:21:30,920
Alright, what the fuck did I miss?

1933
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:32,000
No, I gotta know.

1934
02:21:32,120 --> 02:21:33,180
What did I... Get over here.

1935
02:21:33,600 --> 02:21:34,140
Get over it.

1936
02:21:34,140 --> 02:21:34,960
Is it your toes?

1937
02:21:35,200 --> 02:21:40,960
I swear to God, if I missed your toes again, I swear to God.

1938
02:21:46,160 --> 02:21:48,600
What the fuck did I miss?

1939
02:21:52,500 --> 02:21:53,160
Temperature?

1940
02:21:53,700 --> 02:21:54,760
Oh, she's fine.

1941
02:21:55,720 --> 02:21:56,040
Look.

1942
02:21:57,300 --> 02:21:57,940
See?

1943
02:21:59,900 --> 02:22:01,280
See, she's fine.

1944
02:22:03,560 --> 02:22:05,020
What the fuck did I miss?

1945
02:22:06,380 --> 02:22:07,040
Yeah.

1946
02:22:07,060 --> 02:22:08,300
Yeah, mark the bag.

1947
02:22:08,660 --> 02:22:10,600
What are you supposed to do with infected baggage?

1948
02:22:12,120 --> 02:22:13,160
Well, apparently...

1949
02:22:13,160 --> 02:22:16,420
Oh, it's because I confiscated her bag.

1950
02:22:18,160 --> 02:22:18,520
Oh, yeah.

1951
02:22:18,680 --> 02:22:19,440
Now I remember.

1952
02:22:19,960 --> 02:22:21,420
It's because I took her mother.

1953
02:22:23,420 --> 02:22:24,840
Yeah, it's the items.

1954
02:22:25,160 --> 02:22:26,180
I took her mom.

1955
02:22:27,420 --> 02:22:30,260
It was literally a vial of zombie blood.

1956
02:22:30,940 --> 02:22:33,420
And then they were like, Dodge Bad.

1957
02:22:34,400 --> 02:22:34,920
Like...

1958
02:22:40,730 --> 02:22:49,450
it like it would tell me wouldn't it tell me if it's like a
bio has like that I claimed a bio hazard all right I'm

1959
02:22:49,450 --> 02:23:02,250
grabbing that gun I'm grabbing this high school and I'm
grabbing that you can keep everything else oh well I guess I

1960
02:23:02,250 --> 02:23:03,710
gotta liquidate you.

1961
02:23:05,790 --> 02:23:07,530
I thought you could confiscate you.

1962
02:23:07,710 --> 02:23:09,370
You're supposed to confiscate it too.

1963
02:23:09,830 --> 02:23:10,670
Alright, get over here.

1964
02:23:10,830 --> 02:23:13,490
You had your mom.

1965
02:23:18,340 --> 02:23:19,820
Please don't scan me with that.

1966
02:23:20,700 --> 02:23:21,560
Oh, don't worry.

1967
02:23:22,440 --> 02:23:27,420
Apparently this it says body parts.

1968
02:23:29,040 --> 02:23:29,420
Oh.

1969
02:23:35,100 --> 02:23:37,340
They don't have to know.

1970
02:23:39,520 --> 02:23:40,900
Oh, does the blood not count?

1971
02:23:50,070 --> 02:23:51,390
Do not touch.

1972
02:23:51,630 --> 02:23:53,430
I didn't touch it, I swear.

1973
02:23:58,510 --> 02:24:01,050
I swear I didn't touch the blood.

1974
02:24:01,390 --> 02:24:03,970
I swear I didn't touch it.

1975
02:24:12,810 --> 02:24:14,230
Oh wait, that's a tattoo.

1976
02:24:17,590 --> 02:24:18,610
Oh yeah, I did this already.

1977
02:24:22,270 --> 02:24:23,830
Oh, she is red, a little red.

1978
02:24:26,230 --> 02:24:27,030
Oh, yep, okay.

1979
02:24:27,230 --> 02:24:28,110
In fact, they eliminated.

1980
02:24:29,210 --> 02:24:34,310
Alright, I was gonna say, like, I forgot, I didn't realize I
was not supposed to touch the blood.

1981
02:24:35,110 --> 02:24:36,310
I was just like, what's this?

1982
02:24:39,550 --> 02:24:42,830
I'm just like, whoa, what's this over there?

1983
02:24:42,970 --> 02:24:44,570
No, there's no bite mark on the tattoo.

1984
02:24:44,870 --> 02:24:46,350
That would be very cheeky, though.

1985
02:24:48,450 --> 02:24:50,790
Oh, that's a bruise, though.

1986
02:24:51,610 --> 02:24:52,450
Right there.

1987
02:24:54,930 --> 02:24:57,270
Alright, you are red.

1988
02:24:58,670 --> 02:24:59,850
You have a bruise.

1989
02:25:00,030 --> 02:25:03,050
But other than that, you seem pretty okay.

1990
02:25:03,870 --> 02:25:04,130
Yep.

1991
02:25:08,490 --> 02:25:10,090
Yep, everything seems fine.

1992
02:25:11,210 --> 02:25:16,250
Yeah, it's like, oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, I almost
forgot.

1993
02:25:17,410 --> 02:25:20,870
One day, one day I will find that kinky zombie.

1994
02:25:22,390 --> 02:25:25,290
I want to make sure it's in between the thighs, too.

1995
02:25:27,930 --> 02:25:29,270
All right, you seem safe.

1996
02:25:30,410 --> 02:25:34,370
Other than the fact that you brought a weapon, but that's
not illegal.

1997
02:25:34,650 --> 02:25:36,730
It's just, you know, gotta take it.

1998
02:25:38,910 --> 02:25:39,550
All right, Emily.

1999
02:25:42,030 --> 02:25:43,510
Everything okay with Emily?

2000
02:25:44,110 --> 02:25:44,110
Yay!

2001
02:25:44,630 --> 02:25:45,350
Excellent inspection!

2002
02:25:45,570 --> 02:25:47,210
When will I find the green man?

2003
02:25:48,810 --> 02:25:50,050
Are you green?

2004
02:25:50,490 --> 02:25:51,350
Wait, what?

2005
02:25:52,230 --> 02:25:53,070
You're not green.

2006
02:25:53,410 --> 02:25:55,890
I'm just waiting until I find to get the green man.

2007
02:25:57,170 --> 02:25:58,030
Okay, hiccups.

2008
02:25:59,090 --> 02:25:59,750
Oh, shit.

2009
02:25:59,930 --> 02:26:01,550
Sick tattoos, though, bro.

2010
02:26:04,550 --> 02:26:06,830
Those are some sick-ass tattoos.

2011
02:26:08,110 --> 02:26:09,230
Alright, bruises.

But don't worry, Nunu Doki-Lan.

You're gonna live like a king here.

2015
02:26:21,310 --> 02:26:23,070
Other than that, it's fine.

2016
02:26:23,610 --> 02:26:26,150
You just have really bad bruises.

2017
02:26:27,550 --> 02:26:30,670
Oh, wait, two really bad bruises, actually, right?

02:29:54,650 --> 02:29:55,750
Yeah, fuck that.

2073
02:29:55,950 --> 02:29:56,190
Yeah.

2074
02:29:57,110 --> 02:29:59,630
Free food, so I don't have to buy food?

2075
02:30:00,690 --> 02:30:02,030
Okay, 25 people.

2076
02:30:02,150 --> 02:30:03,650
I don't need to buy that yet.

2077
02:30:05,930 --> 02:30:06,650
Metal detector.

2078
02:30:10,380 --> 02:30:12,560
Okay, I can just check the item myself.

2079
02:30:12,660 --> 02:30:14,220
I do not need to upgrade that.

2080
02:30:17,260 --> 02:30:17,840
That's fine.

2081
02:30:17,900 --> 02:30:18,540
I'm a gamer.

2082
02:30:18,740 --> 02:30:19,460
All right, here we go.

2083
02:30:21,000 --> 02:30:22,100
I'll buy food later.

2084
02:30:22,580 --> 02:30:23,640
I'll buy food tomorrow.

2085
02:30:24,400 --> 02:30:27,060
Tomorrow, like, there's no discount if I buy it.

2086
02:30:27,160 --> 02:30:28,560
It's not Costco or nothing.

2087
02:30:34,300 --> 02:30:34,960
What are the storylines?

2088
02:30:35,360 --> 02:30:36,900
That's what made paper please.

2089
02:30:38,720 --> 02:30:40,040
This is the storyline.

2090
02:30:41,900 --> 02:30:42,900
Don't worry.

2091
02:30:43,520 --> 02:30:44,860
This is the storyline.

2092
02:30:46,520 --> 02:30:47,640
Right here.

2093
02:30:51,560 --> 02:30:53,080
We're in it now.

2094
02:30:54,720 --> 02:30:56,660
A few, few times.

2095
02:30:58,780 --> 02:31:00,820
And also crazy Dave.

2096
02:31:05,120 --> 02:31:06,480
Oh my god, I fucked up.

2097
02:31:10,870 --> 02:31:11,750
Oh no.

2098
02:31:12,710 --> 02:31:13,470
Oh no.

2099
02:31:16,890 --> 02:31:17,550
That's okay, it's okay.

2100
02:31:17,630 --> 02:31:18,430
We got the bomb.

2101
02:31:26,210 --> 02:31:26,790
It's okay.

2102
02:31:37,130 --> 02:31:37,830
Oh my god.

2103
02:31:37,990 --> 02:31:38,450
Oh my god.

2104
02:31:47,280 --> 02:31:49,260
Okay, the trash is the last measure.

2105
02:31:49,840 --> 02:31:50,340
Alright, we're fine.

2106
02:31:50,480 --> 02:31:51,100
Okay, wave two.

2107
02:31:51,240 --> 02:31:52,460
Okay, it might say wave two.

2108
02:31:52,480 --> 02:31:53,680
but we are very fine.

2109
02:32:01,320 --> 02:32:01,940
Oh my god.

2110
02:32:06,240 --> 02:32:06,540
It's okay.

2111
02:32:06,700 --> 02:32:07,000
It's okay.

2112
02:32:07,020 --> 02:32:09,220
It says wave two, but we're so healthy.

2113
02:32:17,680 --> 02:32:18,840
We are so healthy.

2114
02:32:24,530 --> 02:32:25,070
Look at that.

2115
02:32:25,510 --> 02:32:26,050
Oh my god.

2116
02:32:28,150 --> 02:32:29,450
I told you.

2117
02:32:30,410 --> 02:32:31,550
One last guy.

2118
02:32:32,010 --> 02:32:32,510
Look at that.

2119
02:32:32,850 --> 02:32:33,750
Wall secured.

2120
02:32:34,930 --> 02:32:36,050
Amazing story.

2121
02:32:36,490 --> 02:32:36,950
selling.

2122
02:32:39,330 --> 02:32:40,650
That's the story.

2123
02:32:40,930 --> 02:32:41,650
Pew pew.

2124
02:32:46,110 --> 02:32:46,490
Alright.

2125
02:32:47,150 --> 02:32:48,330
Not zero deaths.

2126
02:32:49,550 --> 02:32:49,550
Economy.

2127
02:32:50,490 --> 02:32:50,790
Purchases.

2128
02:32:51,230 --> 02:32:51,670
Penalties.

2129
02:32:52,570 --> 02:32:52,570
Oh.

2130
02:32:53,010 --> 02:32:53,210
Ronville.

2131
02:32:53,330 --> 02:32:54,290
I mean it's $300.

2132
02:32:54,850 --> 02:32:55,550
I'm fucking.

2133
02:32:55,750 --> 02:32:56,390
It's fine.

2134
02:32:57,850 --> 02:32:59,130
It balances out.

2135
02:32:59,170 --> 02:33:02,650
Soldiers say some jackass wrote dirty poems on the camp
walls.

2136
02:33:03,290 --> 02:33:04,530
Find out who they're talking about.

2137
02:33:04,950 --> 02:33:06,450
And track down the artist.

2138
02:33:07,310 --> 02:33:07,730
Oh.

2139
02:33:09,130 --> 02:33:11,150
So I'm intentionally a zombie into last.

2140
02:33:11,230 --> 02:33:12,350
He was beaten severely before.

2141
02:33:12,510 --> 02:33:13,950
We believe he'll attempt to gain access.

2142
02:33:14,250 --> 02:33:15,690
Do not let him in.

2143
02:33:16,350 --> 02:33:16,970
Bruised face.

2144
02:33:17,070 --> 02:33:18,970
What do I... Oh, Target eliminated.

2145
02:33:23,360 --> 02:33:24,600
How would I know?

2146
02:33:25,060 --> 02:33:26,500
He just has a bruised face.

2147
02:33:26,740 --> 02:33:28,120
But like... Wait, what?

2148
02:33:30,120 --> 02:33:31,580
Oh, there's Solomon.

2149
02:33:34,620 --> 02:33:37,220
Find all the poems using a flashlight.

2150
02:33:37,660 --> 02:33:38,800
What does it look like?

2151
02:33:40,380 --> 02:33:42,300
Wait, what do the poems look like?

2152
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:47,220
How the fuck am I supposed to know what the poems look like?

2153
02:33:53,200 --> 02:33:54,280
They got him.

2154
02:33:55,260 --> 02:33:56,680
I just find newspapers.

2155
02:33:58,780 --> 02:33:59,860
Oh, hey, crazy, Dave.

2156
02:34:02,080 --> 02:34:03,900
It looks like a poem.

2157
02:34:07,500 --> 02:34:08,480
Alright, whatever.

2158
02:34:08,820 --> 02:34:10,900
We're just gonna go call in the next survivor.

2159
02:34:14,450 --> 02:34:15,550
Oh, my home?

2160
02:34:16,070 --> 02:34:17,390
Would it be in here?

2161
02:34:22,520 --> 02:34:23,040
Would it actually?

2162
02:34:23,140 --> 02:34:24,400
I don't even know where it would be.

2163
02:34:26,060 --> 02:34:28,640
I have no idea what that would look like.

2164
02:34:30,580 --> 02:34:31,220
Alright, fuck it.

2165
02:34:31,280 --> 02:34:32,720
Let's just call in the next survivor.

2166
02:34:32,900 --> 02:34:33,640
Bring him in.

2167
02:34:34,840 --> 02:34:36,800
It just looks like words.

2168
02:34:39,440 --> 02:34:41,360
All I see are newspapers.

2169
02:34:42,240 --> 02:34:42,880
Alright, fuck it.

2170
02:34:42,900 --> 02:34:43,680
Bring him in.

2171
02:34:44,820 --> 02:34:46,100
Why did it lock the corn?

2172
02:34:46,200 --> 02:34:48,060
I sent like three people in there.

2173
02:34:49,040 --> 02:34:49,560
Huh?

2174
02:34:49,940 --> 02:34:51,260
That symptom's not in our database.

2175
02:34:52,040 --> 02:34:53,200
A fresh mutation.

2176
02:34:53,760 --> 02:34:54,280
Deja vu.

2177
02:34:56,500 --> 02:34:57,780
Pandemics never change.

2178
02:34:58,060 --> 02:34:59,500
Maybe he's going through puberty.

2179
02:34:59,920 --> 02:35:01,220
Time to add it to the symptom chart.

2180
02:35:01,780 --> 02:35:01,960
Oh.

2181
02:35:02,880 --> 02:35:04,160
What does that mean?

2182
02:35:04,680 --> 02:35:06,160
Tap the right symptom on the list.

2183
02:35:06,620 --> 02:35:08,280
Now switch over to the distribution tab.

2184
02:35:08,660 --> 02:35:10,600
There's a lot we don't understand about the disease.

2185
02:35:11,800 --> 02:35:13,520
Scientific research can give us some clues.

2186
02:35:14,260 --> 02:35:15,100
Data from the lab.

2187
02:35:15,320 --> 02:35:17,120
Doesn't know how to swim.

2188
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:20,520
Alright.

2189
02:35:22,140 --> 02:35:22,660
Oh.

2190
02:35:22,660 --> 02:35:24,560
The poor guy won't make it through the procedure.

2191
02:35:25,520 --> 02:35:27,880
You saw him, right?

2192
02:35:28,520 --> 02:35:30,360
Even a light breeze would knock him over.

2193
02:35:31,320 --> 02:35:35,540
This way, maybe his sacrifice will actually help keep others
alive somehow.

2194
02:35:36,620 --> 02:35:39,060
Oh, there was a poem on the wall of my home?

2195
02:35:40,060 --> 02:35:40,940
Oh, really?

2196
02:35:45,270 --> 02:35:45,790
Here?

2197
02:35:47,810 --> 02:35:49,290
I don't see no poem.

2198
02:35:50,490 --> 02:35:51,770
Or is it in here?

2199
02:35:55,990 --> 02:35:57,370
How the fuck is this poem?

2200
02:35:59,430 --> 02:36:00,010
It's a graffiti.

2201
02:36:00,130 --> 02:36:01,030
Oh, wait, it's a graffiti.

2202
02:36:01,370 --> 02:36:01,730
Oh, wait, yeah.

2203
02:36:01,870 --> 02:36:02,490
Oh, here you go.

2204
02:36:04,650 --> 02:36:04,990
Oh!

2205
02:36:06,270 --> 02:36:06,670
Oh!

2206
02:36:07,310 --> 02:36:10,310
Yeah, I remember it said graffiti, but I was, like, a little
confused.

2207
02:36:12,350 --> 02:36:13,690
Alright, I found it.

2208
02:36:16,470 --> 02:36:16,870
What?

2209
02:36:19,090 --> 02:36:20,390
Was that always there?

2210
02:36:23,530 --> 02:36:27,390
Was the red markings on the floor always there, guys?

2211
02:36:27,990 --> 02:36:28,070
Street.

2212
02:36:28,990 --> 02:36:31,210
I imagine that was also...

2213
02:36:35,320 --> 02:36:37,080
I wonder if there's more here.

2214
02:36:41,540 --> 02:36:43,080
Where the fuck is the next poem?

2215
02:36:43,760 --> 02:36:45,660
I mean, street is not the...

2216
02:36:45,660 --> 02:36:46,320
Oh, there it is.

2217
02:36:47,700 --> 02:36:48,320
Alright.

2218
02:36:48,740 --> 02:36:49,120
Nice.

2219
02:36:50,900 --> 02:36:51,200
Okay.

2220
02:36:51,400 --> 02:36:52,820
Oh, it is like a little hint.

2221
02:36:56,780 --> 02:36:57,940
Okay, let's try.

2222
02:36:58,020 --> 02:36:58,600
Laboratory.

2223
02:36:58,620 --> 02:37:00,440
There has to be one here.

2224
02:37:02,020 --> 02:37:02,440
Hey, guys.

2225
02:37:05,040 --> 02:37:07,360
Just got trying to find my local graffiti.

2226
02:37:12,250 --> 02:37:12,370
Oh.

2227
02:37:14,610 --> 02:37:15,610
Where is it?

2228
02:37:17,430 --> 02:37:18,790
What the fuck is it?

2229
02:37:20,350 --> 02:37:21,130
Oh, my God.

2230
02:37:21,250 --> 02:37:22,230
He climbed up here.

2231
02:37:23,550 --> 02:37:24,050
Oh, my God.

2232
02:37:24,110 --> 02:37:26,630
He's just sending me on a wild goddamn goose chase.

2233
02:37:26,790 --> 02:37:27,050
Oh, hey.

2234
02:37:28,590 --> 02:37:29,110
Alright.

2235
02:37:30,850 --> 02:37:37,130
Oregon highlighted destroy the organs highlighted yellow and
as they are blocking the way to target Oregon do not destroy

There's like, it's...

He's just hit puberty or some shit.

2250
02:39:48,680 --> 02:39:50,060
Oh, that's cool.

2251
02:39:50,200 --> 02:39:52,720
You're trying to figure out what his new mutation is.

2252
02:39:56,120 --> 02:39:56,740
Oh, yeah.

2253
02:39:56,980 --> 02:39:58,480
Oh, we had to go here for something.

2254
02:39:58,680 --> 02:39:59,760
I wonder what we had to do again.

2255
02:40:00,240 --> 02:40:01,220
It's like deja vu.

2256
02:40:09,060 --> 02:40:10,100
That's cool.

2257
02:40:10,560 --> 02:40:12,440
I wonder what we have to do inside there.

2258
02:40:21,720 --> 02:40:23,400
Destroy the organs.

2259
02:40:23,680 --> 02:40:27,200
Highlight a yell and they're blocking the way to the...

2260
02:40:27,200 --> 02:40:28,460
How do I destroy it?

2261
02:40:51,650 --> 02:40:51,890
Oh.

2262
02:40:55,390 --> 02:40:56,790
Oh, I see.

2263
02:41:00,350 --> 02:41:00,990
Okay.

2264
02:41:07,240 --> 02:41:08,040
Everything is fine.

2265
02:41:12,910 --> 02:41:15,610
Jesus Christ, this entire thing is blocking it.

2266
02:41:16,390 --> 02:41:17,690
Alright, he doesn't need the ribcage.

2267
02:41:18,050 --> 02:41:18,310
It's fine.

2268
02:41:18,430 --> 02:41:19,250
He doesn't need this.

2269
02:41:20,670 --> 02:41:23,370
Alright, he doesn't need his ribs as well.

2270
02:41:25,050 --> 02:41:26,330
And then...

2271
02:41:26,330 --> 02:41:27,230
You know what?

2272
02:41:27,370 --> 02:41:28,410
Who needs that?

2273
02:41:31,410 --> 02:41:32,450
You don't need this.

2274
02:41:32,510 --> 02:41:33,190
You're fine.

2275
02:41:33,310 --> 02:41:34,090
You don't need that.

2276
02:41:34,590 --> 02:41:35,670
You don't need this.

2277
02:41:35,870 --> 02:41:38,110
Have you ever told you don't need all those ribs?

2278
02:41:39,070 --> 02:41:40,610
What is that?

2279
02:41:40,630 --> 02:41:41,330
Your gallbladder?

2280
02:41:41,570 --> 02:41:43,090
You're fine without it.

2281
02:41:47,410 --> 02:41:47,950
Yay!

2282
02:41:49,030 --> 02:41:49,970
We did it!

2283
02:41:50,830 --> 02:41:52,390
All right, place to extract it.

2284
02:41:52,470 --> 02:41:54,310
All right, I discovered a new symptom.

2285
02:41:54,610 --> 02:41:54,910
All right.

2286
02:41:55,870 --> 02:41:57,230
We did it, guys.

2287
02:41:57,570 --> 02:41:57,570
Oh.

2288
02:41:59,230 --> 02:41:59,690
Boop.

2289
02:42:01,030 --> 02:42:01,570
Operation.

2290
02:42:08,400 --> 02:42:10,220
Oh, what do I put in here?

2291
02:42:11,020 --> 02:42:11,660
Analyze.

2292
02:42:15,290 --> 02:42:17,170
All right, skin rash.

2293
02:42:18,050 --> 02:42:20,890
Okay, and then that leads to necrosis.

2294
02:42:21,310 --> 02:42:23,770
Okay, all right, that ain't too bad.

2295
02:42:27,480 --> 02:42:28,220
Look at that.

2296
02:42:28,760 --> 02:42:29,860
Look at that, guys.

2297
02:42:29,980 --> 02:42:30,900
We did it.

2298
02:42:31,960 --> 02:42:33,240
First try.

2299
02:42:36,600 --> 02:42:38,660
We did the science thing.

2300
02:42:39,860 --> 02:42:41,560
And we first tried it, too.

2301
02:42:41,580 --> 02:42:42,860
Oh my gosh, we're so smart.

2302
02:42:45,980 --> 02:42:47,900
We're so smart, guys.

2303
02:42:53,340 --> 02:42:54,960
Alright, we can do the graffiti later.

2304
02:42:56,380 --> 02:42:56,420
Alright.

2305
02:42:56,920 --> 02:42:57,860
Now it goes through the quarantine.

2306
02:42:57,920 --> 02:42:58,620
Oh, now I can.

2307
02:43:01,860 --> 02:43:03,240
What am I supposed to do with Solomon?

2308
02:43:03,520 --> 02:43:05,040
Is he just chilling here?

2309
02:43:06,260 --> 02:43:08,440
Alright, apparently he said he survived.

2310
02:43:08,560 --> 02:43:09,500
I don't even know what.

2311
02:43:09,580 --> 02:43:11,120
Did he even have any symptoms?

2312
02:43:11,500 --> 02:43:13,240
Oh, yeah.

2313
02:43:14,480 --> 02:43:15,820
He just has freckles.

2314
02:43:18,860 --> 02:43:19,180
What the fuck?

2315
02:43:19,400 --> 02:43:20,960
This buddy just has freckles.

2316
02:43:25,600 --> 02:43:26,880
I guess do I keep him here?

2317
02:43:27,040 --> 02:43:27,900
Just check again.

2318
02:43:29,800 --> 02:43:30,900
Alright, next.

2319
02:43:34,900 --> 02:43:36,160
Alright, what do you have for me?

2320
02:43:38,100 --> 02:43:40,700
Thank you for at least not yelling at me.

2321
02:43:41,140 --> 02:43:42,200
What the fuck?

2322
02:43:45,100 --> 02:43:46,700
Are these loot boxes?

2323
02:43:47,020 --> 02:43:47,340
Ooh.

2324
02:43:48,180 --> 02:43:51,740
Which loot boxes do I take?

2325
02:43:56,180 --> 02:43:56,860
Alright.

2326
02:43:58,000 --> 02:43:59,700
Ooh, loot box time.

2327
02:43:59,780 --> 02:44:00,580
Gamba, Gamba.

2328
02:44:00,760 --> 02:44:01,440
Biggest one.

2329
02:44:01,800 --> 02:44:02,560
It's big.

2330
02:44:02,780 --> 02:44:04,860
So there must be lots of stuff in here.

2331
02:44:05,360 --> 02:44:05,700
What?

2332
02:44:07,780 --> 02:44:08,820
I can't even...

2333
02:44:08,820 --> 02:44:09,680
Oh my gosh.

2334
02:44:09,760 --> 02:44:11,920
I can't even confiscate it.

2335
02:44:12,700 --> 02:44:13,740
What's the point?

2336
02:44:16,300 --> 02:44:17,880
I'm not even...

2337
02:44:18,180 --> 02:44:19,240
Oh, wait, am I?

2338
02:44:19,260 --> 02:44:19,560
Oh!

2339
02:44:20,040 --> 02:44:20,680
Wait, X-Ray?

2340
02:44:21,620 --> 02:44:22,020
No.

2341
02:44:24,400 --> 02:44:28,020
I can't believe it's considered a personal item.

2342
02:44:31,870 --> 02:44:33,550
That's messed up.

2343
02:44:34,970 --> 02:44:36,430
He seems fine.

2344
02:44:36,750 --> 02:44:37,930
He's actually pretty healthy.

2345
02:44:38,130 --> 02:44:38,810
Not gonna lie.

2346
02:44:41,930 --> 02:44:45,970
There's, like, nothing wrong with him other than the fact
that he has loot boxes.

2347
02:44:47,450 --> 02:44:48,750
He cheated the system.

2348
02:44:48,850 --> 02:44:49,730
If he puts him...

2349
02:44:49,830 --> 02:44:50,650
puts it in a box.

2350
02:44:50,830 --> 02:44:52,350
I can't take anything from him.

2351
02:44:55,890 --> 02:44:57,050
Oh, this is bullshit.

2352
02:44:57,430 --> 02:44:58,210
Open the box.

2353
02:44:59,050 --> 02:45:00,830
It's not fair.

2354
02:45:04,710 --> 02:45:06,570
It's not fair.

2355
02:45:10,540 --> 02:45:12,880
Why is it unknown symptom?

2356
02:45:16,340 --> 02:45:18,600
Oh, if he has an unknown symptom.

2357
02:45:18,940 --> 02:45:18,940
Yeah.

2358
02:45:19,460 --> 02:45:20,800
What's in the box?

2359
02:45:26,580 --> 02:45:28,840
I can't do anything with this guy.

2360
02:45:33,190 --> 02:45:35,810
Maybe you should grab the green one.

2361
02:45:36,910 --> 02:45:39,010
I can't even open any of them.

2362
02:45:39,230 --> 02:45:40,090
It's not fair.

2363
02:45:43,710 --> 02:45:44,830
I swear to God.

2364
02:45:47,170 --> 02:45:47,570
Okay.

2365
02:45:48,630 --> 02:45:49,390
It's actually...

2366
02:45:50,670 --> 02:45:51,350
What

2367
02:45:55,500 --> 02:45:56,620
are you doing?

2368
02:45:56,980 --> 02:45:58,140
Is this really necessary?

2369
02:45:59,600 --> 02:46:01,520
It's just like what's in the...

2370
02:46:04,810 --> 02:46:06,850
You need to let me keep that.

2371
02:46:07,410 --> 02:46:09,670
What the fuck is that?

2372
02:46:09,730 --> 02:46:12,510
Is that a rock or what is that?

2373
02:46:14,630 --> 02:46:15,310
Oh my god.

2374
02:46:16,610 --> 02:46:17,830
A new gaming PC.

2375
02:46:18,270 --> 02:46:18,770
Let's go.

2376
02:46:19,290 --> 02:46:22,390
How the fuck did he put Keptat in the bag?

2377
02:46:22,970 --> 02:46:26,090
Is that careful he will attack you?

2378
02:46:26,130 --> 02:46:26,690
Maybe.

2379
02:46:29,910 --> 02:46:30,330
Alright.

2380
02:46:31,990 --> 02:46:32,370
Okay.

2381
02:46:32,630 --> 02:46:33,470
I mean, sick task.

2382
02:46:33,490 --> 02:46:34,290
too, though.

2383
02:46:36,330 --> 02:46:37,390
At least, yeah.

2384
02:46:42,950 --> 02:46:46,050
Wait, oh, yeah, I forgot about the sword.

2385
02:46:49,690 --> 02:46:52,550
Bro is scheming until he dies.

2386
02:46:53,070 --> 02:46:55,510
He won't need the setup anyway.

2387
02:46:57,270 --> 02:46:59,350
I think he intentionally got bit.

2388
02:46:59,350 --> 02:47:02,330
Like, how do you get bit on the fucking forehead?

2389
02:47:03,050 --> 02:47:03,350
Bro.

2390
02:47:04,330 --> 02:47:07,310
I don't even think I need to scan nothing.

2391
02:47:07,950 --> 02:47:10,770
At least, I mean, at least he doesn't have a fever.

2392
02:47:11,330 --> 02:47:11,910
At least.

2393
02:47:12,910 --> 02:47:14,530
Like, it's little things.

2394
02:47:16,010 --> 02:47:17,510
Alright, that is...

2395
02:47:17,510 --> 02:47:20,130
I think he has a bite mark.

2396
02:47:21,350 --> 02:47:23,230
Corruption's only bad if you're not involved.

2397
02:47:23,590 --> 02:47:24,310
Get his rat.

2398
02:47:25,410 --> 02:47:28,510
Guys, I'm pretty sure he's not getting his PC back, guys.

2399
02:47:29,450 --> 02:47:31,150
I'm pretty sure.

2400
02:47:34,730 --> 02:47:39,270
I have a feeling that his PC is not coming with him.

2401
02:47:39,270 --> 02:47:40,090
Am I?

2402
02:47:40,090 --> 02:47:40,730
Am I in trouble?

2403
02:47:41,390 --> 02:47:42,410
I thought I was safe.

2404
02:47:44,870 --> 02:47:46,310
Please don't scan me with that.

2405
02:47:46,710 --> 02:47:47,670
It is a weird story.

2406
02:47:47,790 --> 02:47:50,250
Okay, I'm pretty sure she's yellow for real.

2407
02:47:51,230 --> 02:47:52,390
Also, her eyes are red.

2408
02:47:53,570 --> 02:47:54,290
Wait, why?

2409
02:47:54,850 --> 02:47:56,570
Why are you yellow?

2410
02:47:57,670 --> 02:47:58,850
That's yellow, right?

2411
02:47:59,010 --> 02:47:59,970
That's green?

2412
02:48:02,050 --> 02:48:03,310
Is that green?

2413
02:48:03,490 --> 02:48:04,470
That's yellow!

2414
02:48:06,630 --> 02:48:07,890
She's yellow!

2415
02:48:13,380 --> 02:48:16,360
Yeah, but I have to send her to liquidation anyway.

2416
02:48:17,000 --> 02:48:17,360
Yeah!

2417
02:48:20,620 --> 02:48:22,100
Like, it doesn't matter.

2418
02:48:22,320 --> 02:48:24,020
She's going to liquidation.

2419
02:48:26,040 --> 02:48:27,540
No matter what.

2420
02:48:27,600 --> 02:48:29,160
Oh, and she has a fever, too.

2421
02:48:29,620 --> 02:48:30,240
Oh, 40.

2422
02:48:30,440 --> 02:48:31,100
41.

2423
02:48:31,640 --> 02:48:32,260
42.

2424
02:48:33,020 --> 02:48:33,440
43.

2425
02:48:33,840 --> 02:48:34,520
Jesus.

2426
02:48:35,040 --> 02:48:36,080
It didn't stop.

2427
02:48:39,220 --> 02:48:49,320
43 okay and then I mean I guess just to be safe just to make

Not the zombie.

2456
02:50:42,420 --> 02:50:44,980
She and the zombies were freaky.

Here you went.

2605
02:59:51,910 --> 02:59:53,190
Up the stairs.

2606
02:59:55,230 --> 02:59:56,490
Can't stop gossip.

2607
02:59:56,890 --> 02:59:57,870

2608
02:59:58,390 --> 03:00:00,270

Okay, he walked out.

2614
03:00:13,390 --> 03:00:14,010
Now what?

2615
03:00:14,810 --> 03:00:15,890
Walked back this way?

2616
03:00:20,590 --> 03:00:21,670
Oh, there you go.

2617
03:00:22,430 --> 03:00:28,070

2618
03:00:28,730 --> 03:00:28,970

03:00:29,890 --> 03:00:30,790
Abe Crow.

2620
03:00:32,870 --> 03:00:34,490

2621
03:00:34,950 --> 03:00:35,170
Hey.

2622
03:00:36,070 --> 03:00:37,490
Don't feel a little rat.

2623
03:00:37,750 --> 03:00:39,730
Let me catch him or rip his ears off.

2624
03:00:40,250 --> 03:00:41,050
This place is a church.

2625
03:00:41,070 --> 03:00:43,530
Who the hell let him get his hands on the paint?

2626
03:00:44,110 --> 03:00:45,870
Who's in charge of the goddamn storage?

2627
03:00:48,950 --> 03:00:50,010
Wait, who is?

2628
03:00:51,070 --> 03:00:52,150

2630
03:00:56,030 --> 03:00:57,170
What's in there?

2631
03:00:59,170 --> 03:01:00,610
Oh, this is my storage.

2632
03:01:01,290 --> 03:01:05,310
I left the storage unlocked, and now we're missing some
paint cans.

2633
03:01:06,610 --> 03:01:10,150

inspection.

I can explain.

2642
03:02:03,180 --> 03:02:04,920
The old fool brought it on himself.

2643
03:02:05,420 --> 03:02:07,080
He can't keep his mouth shut.

2644
03:02:07,760 --> 03:02:11,380
He's always picking fights and talking jokes behind
everyone's back.

2645
03:02:11,680 --> 03:02:13,200
I just wanted to teach him a lesson.

2646
03:02:13,460 --> 03:02:14,360

03:03:06,540 --> 03:03:08,500
How much money is that?

2653
03:03:08,660 --> 03:03:09,520
It's not a lot.

2654
03:03:09,740 --> 03:03:10,120
You're right.

2655
03:03:10,340 --> 03:03:11,560
You're right.

2656
03:03:11,760 --> 03:03:13,960
He says the military will give me more money.

2657
03:03:14,080 --> 03:03:15,280
You're so right, guys.

2658
03:03:16,500 --> 03:03:17,100
You're right.

2659
03:03:18,420 --> 03:03:20,580
The military will give me more money.

2660
03:03:21,880 --> 03:03:23,560
They've always been so kind to me.

2661
03:03:25,500 --> 03:03:27,480
You're so right, guys.

2662
03:03:29,320 --> 03:03:30,260
Thank you so much.

2663
03:03:30,700 --> 03:03:31,460
You're my savior.

2664
03:03:34,940 --> 03:03:35,960
Did he give me money?

2665
03:03:38,160 --> 03:03:39,160
Wait, where's my money?

2666
03:03:42,320 --> 03:03:42,700
What?

2667
03:03:44,980 --> 03:03:46,260
Wait, where's my money?

2668
03:03:48,760 --> 03:03:52,100
Um, I was promised money!

2669
03:03:57,010 --> 03:03:59,510
maybe he left it

2670
03:04:02,600 --> 03:04:14,760
I think I got scammed yeah and then I got scammed by the
military guys I don't understand after all those promotions

2671
03:04:14,760 --> 03:04:27,720
and yet no play race I I thought I was so appreciated but
was I not appreciated for a job well done

2672
03:04:31,090 --> 03:04:32,710
I fell for it again.

2673
03:04:33,750 --> 03:04:34,390
I...

2674
03:04:34,390 --> 03:04:36,290
She fell for it again.

2675
03:04:40,150 --> 03:04:42,490
Oh, government support.

2676
03:04:44,070 --> 03:04:46,330
She fell for it again.

2677
03:04:51,410 --> 03:04:53,190
Don't play possum, soldier.

2678
03:04:53,450 --> 03:04:54,130
I know you're up.

2679
03:04:54,770 --> 03:04:55,570
There's a new symptom.

2680
03:04:55,610 --> 03:04:57,190
There's another new symptom?

2681
03:04:57,950 --> 03:05:00,530
Oh my god, this virus keeps mutating.

2682
03:05:01,390 --> 03:05:02,950
New directives are available.

2683
03:05:03,650 --> 03:05:04,090
Check the bullet.

2684
03:05:05,490 --> 03:05:06,390
Didn't sleep, huh?

2685
03:05:07,450 --> 03:05:08,670
I can't blame you.

2686
03:05:09,010 --> 03:05:11,730
I've pretty much forgotten what a good night's sleep feels
like myself.

2687
03:05:12,470 --> 03:05:15,270
I keep waking up like I can't catch my breath.

2688
03:05:15,970 --> 03:05:18,030
Turns out you can spot the infection the same way.

2689
03:05:19,370 --> 03:05:21,650
Listen closely to how a person breathes.

2690
03:05:22,050 --> 03:05:24,670
And you'll figure out quick if they're sick.

2691
03:05:25,470 --> 03:05:25,530
What?

2692
03:05:27,870 --> 03:05:29,610
Holy shit, I gotta listen.

2693
03:05:29,670 --> 03:05:30,670
Okay, I'm gonna check.

03:05:31,810 --> 03:05:43,850

solomon no incidents reported oh my god not to listen to him

2698
03:06:17,210 --> 03:06:32,670

2699

tears.

2700
03:06:33,190 --> 03:06:36,050
Okay, I guess I don't have to check your breathing.

2701
03:06:42,120 --> 03:06:44,600
But that does not sound right.

2702
03:06:45,280 --> 03:06:48,120
It looks like a fucking black spot for cancer, too.

2703
03:06:52,960 --> 03:06:55,420
He's got the black lung.

2704
03:06:58,500 --> 03:06:59,060
Um.

2705
03:07:00,840 --> 03:07:02,560
Oh, okay, it's like that.

2706
03:07:02,900 --> 03:07:04,060
Wait, sickly breath.

2707
03:07:04,420 --> 03:07:04,740
Wait, what?

2708
03:07:04,760 --> 03:07:05,000
What?

2709
03:07:07,500 --> 03:07:08,500
Wait, I thought...

2710
03:07:08,500 --> 03:07:09,200
What's the point?

2711
03:07:17,140 --> 03:07:18,180
Wait, what?

2712
03:07:21,510 --> 03:07:23,550
Oh, I didn't send you to the lab?

2713
03:07:24,050 --> 03:07:24,970
Alright, laptop.

2714
03:07:27,630 --> 03:07:29,650
I mean, you do have freckles as well.

2715
03:07:32,050 --> 03:07:33,190
Just to be safe.

2716
03:07:35,230 --> 03:07:37,130
Wait, Doki's coughing.

2717
03:07:37,870 --> 03:07:38,250
Hmm.

2718
03:07:43,860 --> 03:07:44,600
to be saved.

2719
03:07:47,920 --> 03:07:50,320
Oh, I'm so good at this now.

2720
03:07:53,460 --> 03:07:53,520
Wait.

2721
03:07:53,860 --> 03:07:55,400
Okay, I was going to say that one boot.

2722
03:07:55,880 --> 03:07:57,200
Alright, lab two, go!

2723

Yeah, but yeah.

2728
03:08:19,570 --> 03:08:22,410
He has a black spot on his lungs.

2729
03:08:28,500 --> 03:08:30,140
Oh, there it is.

2730
03:08:31,440 --> 03:08:32,280
