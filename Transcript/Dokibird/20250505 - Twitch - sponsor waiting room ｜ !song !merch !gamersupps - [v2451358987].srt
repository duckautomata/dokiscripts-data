00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:43,590
Hello, everybody.

2
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,270
Hello, hello.

3
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:49,570
Sorry, I decided to loop because, like, I'm very tired.

4
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:52,730
Toki is dizzle.

5
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:54,370
What's new, Toki?

6
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:55,790
That's my secret.

7
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:57,410
I'm always tired.

8
00:03:58,550 --> 00:03:59,550
Hello, everybody.

9
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:00,570
Hello, hello.

10
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:02,830
So thank you for the Twitch Prime.

11
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:03,410
Thank you.

12
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:04,130
Thank you.

13
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:06,030
But yes, hello, everybody.

14
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:11,130
I am on Twitch today because we have a sponsor today.

15
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:12,030
On Twitch.

16
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:21,570
And this is, like, the sponsor waiting room right now because I cannot say what it is until 30 minutes.

17
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:23,290
I can say what it is in 30 minutes.

18
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:25,470
That's basically it.

19
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:29,750
It might have leaked earlier because I might have messed up a little.

20
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:33,370
But you guys didn't see.

21
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:39,170
If you guys were here camping in my chat, you didn't see what it was.

22
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:47,510
I turned it off the moment I realized I might have made an oopsie.

23
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:48,690
But that's okay.

24
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:50,010
We didn't see.

25
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:51,370
It didn't happen on stream.

26
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:55,190
No leaks, guys.

27
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:55,750
No leaks.

28
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:58,790
I sound sick because I am sick.

29
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:04,370
I feel my brain feels a little foggy today because I am still sick.

30
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:07,390
I've been, like, blowing my nose all day.

31
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:14,650
Today was not, like, the best day last night because I was coughing myself.

32
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:16,830
I was coughing a lot last night.

33
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:17,610
Well, not a lot.

34
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:20,990
Like, I mean, it's not as much as I used to cough when I am...

35
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:22,290
When I do get, like, really, really sick.

36
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:23,930
But I did cough a bit.

37
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:26,330
But, like, you know, I'm not coughing now.

38
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:26,830
I'm gonna...

39
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:28,350
And then I'm gonna start coughing later.

40
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:34,350
Uh, but it was not as bad as it should be, which is nice.

41
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:37,990
Um, but I do sound like, you know, I sound terrible.

42
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:38,510
I know.

43
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:38,970
I'm sorry.

44
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:40,950
Uh, I need to warm up my voice.

45
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:45,110
The moment my voice is more warmed up, um, things will sound a lot better.

46
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:49,010
Uh, Nestrix and Poofy, thank you for the Twitch Prime.

47
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:49,470
Thank you.

48
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:50,410
Thank you, everybody.

49
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:55,750
Um, but yes, my brain does feel just a little bit foggy today.

50
00:05:55,750 --> 00:06:01,130
Um, just because, like, uh, I'm definitely gonna head to bed after this stream.

51
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:03,350
Uh, I did sleep really early yesterday.

52
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:07,130
But, I mean, I did have, like, three hours of sleep yesterday.

53
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:09,430
Uh, due to circumstances.

54
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:14,090
And I woke up today.

55
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:16,310
I woke up today at...

56
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:19,750
I wish I had those headphones where, like, I could just, like, walk anywhere.

57
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:20,930
And you could still hear me.

58
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:23,090
And I could literally just, like, stream from my bed.

59
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:24,150
I...

60
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:28,870
Like, you know, doing a sick stream, and I'll just be streaming from my bed.

61
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:36,670
And I'll just have to pull up my own stream on my phone just to make sure nothing crazy is happening while I'm in my bed.

62
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:40,570
But sadly, I do not have that privilege right now.

63
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:47,250
But, oh my gosh, sorry, my brain blanked up because of how I'm not okay.

64
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,190
What was I going to say?

65
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:55,790
Anyway, dad update!

66
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:56,990
I'll give you guys a dad update.

67
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:58,550
I know you guys love dad updates.

68
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:02,410
He is at the dog sitter right now.

69
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:07,210
And he's having a good time.

70
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:13,610
Apparently, he is being fed wet food right now, which is why he's extra happy.

71
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:18,370
Because usually we give him, you know, dog kibble.

72
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:25,090
So, because he is a sick boy, we decided to give him some wet food.

73
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:27,130
And he's been devouring that, apparently.

74
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:28,970
So, I'll give you guys a little cute update.

75
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:32,830
The dog sitter sent me, like, a little text about how he's doing.

76
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:34,310
So, alright.

77
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:36,310
So, here's a little dog update.

78
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:38,510
I'm working from... this is from the dog sitter.

79
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:41,590
I'm working from home today, and Doki wants to sit up at my desk with me.

80
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:42,750
So, I rigged this.

81
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:44,150
He's quite happy with it.

82
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:47,150
And apparently, he was also on the patio sunbathing.

83
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:49,530
So, there's a little cute dad update.

84
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:52,970
He's just... he... basically, this is where he lives right now.

85
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:55,690
Because he's not allowed to move at the moment.

86
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:59,310
So, he lives in this little... in this little box thing.

87
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:02,910
So, they, like, basically, like, bring this box thing everywhere with him.

88
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:05,370
Because he's not allowed to move around a lot.

89
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:08,450
So, this is, like, where he lives for now.

90
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:11,090
Until he's able to walk better.

91
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:12,610
Until he's able to walk more.

92
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:13,690
And stuff.

93
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:14,310
So, yeah.

94
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:16,630
And apparently, all he does is sleep.

95
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:17,410
Which is nice.

96
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:19,650
Because, you know, sleeping is really good for recovery.

97
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:23,530
And then he still does this, like, you know, physical therapy exercises.

98
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:24,830
And stuff like that.

99
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:27,150
But this is where he lives for now.

100
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:28,870
He's, like, he's, like, a little...

101
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:31,310
A little fish in a fishbowl.

102
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:32,370
But he's happy.

103
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:33,610
And that's all that matters.

104
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:37,170
Dad of the box.

105
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:39,270
What is your wisdom today?

106
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:40,350
Uh, man.

107
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:44,330
That's the little dad update that we have for all of you guys.

108
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:45,370
Yeah.

109
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:46,830
My little package weenie.

110
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:49,870
Oh, my God.

111
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:52,890
I can feel how sick I am right now.

112
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:58,600
I don't know how.

113
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:02,840
But somehow, I always manage to have my sponsor streams right when I'm sick.

114
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,940
Which is very unlucky.

115
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:10,040
Either I'm sick during, like, conventions.

116
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:13,760
Or I'm sick during sponsors.

117
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:16,260
Uh, my body has not been doing so well.

118
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,940
Um, contained for his crimes.

119
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,940
Uh, I am cursed.

120
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:21,440
You know?

121
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:21,860
Okay.

122
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:28,560
So, I'm starting to believe this little, like, thing that showed up on my Twitter feed one day.

123
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,360
Where you were supposed to calculate your luck or whatever for the new year.

124
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,900
And they're like, oh, find your, like, find your month.

125
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:37,100
And what was it?

126
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:38,280
It was like, find your month.

127
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,620
Like, your birth month.

128
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,820
And your birth, uh, birth date.

129
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:45,000
And, like, see how lucky you are for the new year.

130
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,120
And then, I found my number.

131
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:49,280
And it was at the very end.

132
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:53,880
Like, I was at the, one of the ends of how, of the unlucky meter.

133
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,440
And I was like, oh, that can't be true.

134
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,560
And now I'm like, oh, maybe it is true.

135
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,100
Maybe.

136
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,700
Oh, man.

137
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,580
I don't know.

138
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,820
Now I'm worried.

139
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,860
Maybe they were on this.

140
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,620
It's just like astrology.

141
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:18,140
Maybe astrology was real this entire time.

142
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:19,520
Who would have thought?

143
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,560
Also, the Apex Legend.

144
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:23,860
Thank you for the five gifted subs.

145
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:24,280
Thank you.

146
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:25,020
Thank you.

147
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,720
And thank you for the tier one sub.

148
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:27,020
Thank you.

149
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:27,660
Thank you.

150
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,040
Charlie, thank you for the hundred biddies.

151
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:30,560
Thank you.

152
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,300
Thank you.

153
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:33,300
I really appreciate it.

154
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:34,160
Thank you, guys.

155
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:34,720
Oh, my God.

156
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,460
Maybe they're right.

157
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,560
If that's real, what else could also be real?

158
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:39,640
Oh, my God.

159
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,360
Maybe astrology was real all along.

160
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:43,600
I knew it.

161
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,260
I knew my... my stars.

162
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,520
I won't say it.

163
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:55,340
I don't remember how... Astrology is like based off of... Oh, cool.

164
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,180
I got a little frog.

165
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,600
Look at my little frog, guys.

166
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58,440
Choo-choo.

167
00:10:58,940 --> 00:10:59,680
Look at him go.

168
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,680
Oh my god, I got a little frog.

169
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:05,720
Sorry, my brain is much more... Like, I don't have ADHD, guys.

170
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,600
But it's much more ADHD than usual.

171
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,320
But I don't have ADHD.

172
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,780
At least don't become a star.

173
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,220
But the stars!

174
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,300
The stars are trying to tell me something!

175
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,220
Oh yeah.

176
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,520
I didn't hope my schedule will be posted later tonight.

177
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:26,980
When I wake up.

178
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,280
When I wake up.

179
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:35,260
Because like, obviously after the stream, I'm gonna go...

180
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,920
I'm gonna be like...

181
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:43,940
But...

182
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,980
Oh my god, what was I gonna say?

183
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:46,780
Oh yeah, my schedule.

184
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,380
So, my schedule.

185
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:51,400
There's not gonna be anything much new in my schedule.

186
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,860
Other than like, you know, finishing some series.

187
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,080
So like, you know, Dynasty Warriors.

188
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,500
And everything.

189
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,500
So, I was just waiting for confirmation on like, times for stuff.

190
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:08,940
But, uh, but other than that, there's not gonna be like, a lot of new stuff on my schedule.

191
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,400
Other than what I've already told you guys.

192
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,320
Other than like, the stuff I want to finish and everything.

193
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,160
The one thing I do want to...

194
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,460
No collapse this week.

195
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:17,400
No collapse this week.

196
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,540
I need to take a break.

197
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,080
Um, at the moment.

198
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,400
Because, you know, um...

199
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,040
I'm tired.

200
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,120
There's a lot of stuff to finish as well.

201
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:30,720
Um, there's Dynasty Warriors that we have to finish as well.

202
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:32,080
And there's a lot of reading and everything.

203
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,640
So, no collapse this week.

204
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,600
I mean, we did finish our Ford Park series with Mint earlier.

205
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:40,900
With, um, with Visage.

206
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,820
So, uh, so we're just chillin' today.

207
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,280
Um, and everything.

208
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,660
Um, I'm trying to see if there's anything else.

209
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:52,340
You know, I can't wait to finally finish Dynasty Warriors.

210
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,400
So I can start Epic Mickey.

211
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,560
I really want to...

212
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:59,080
I'm actually really, really, really looking forward to finishing...

213
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,080
To starting Epic Mickey.

214
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:03,920
Because that's a game that I've been wanting to play for the longest time.

215
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:08,180
And, uh, it seems like, um, it seems really fun.

216
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:09,820
And I know it's a platformer.

217
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,460
But it's different, you know?

218
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:14,040
Um, I'm tired of trying...

219
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,440
Okay, okay.

220
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,160
I've been playing a lot of really difficult games lately.

221
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,120
Okay, guys?

222
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,700
And I am tired of trying.

223
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,940
I want something.

224
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,920
I want something more chill.

225
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:32,760
I'm tired of games.

226
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:36,720
And fucking becoming souls-like out of nowhere.

227
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:37,780
I...

228
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,360
I want...

229
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,480
I want a baby game.

230
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:52,400
Sometimes a gamer wants to stop gaming, okay?

231
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:55,640
Sometimes a gamer just wants to...

232
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,660
Just wants to chill.

233
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:58,980
All right?

234
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,180
And today...

235
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:02,480
And this next week is that week.

236
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:05,820
Look, I had to deal with hit and run.

237
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:07,800
I have to deal with reading.

238
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:09,920
I have to deal with...

239
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,060
Dynasty Warriors suddenly becoming souls-like.

240
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,520
We're at the fight Lu Bu.

241
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:18,300
And then be stuck there for almost two hours.

242
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:19,960
And I'm tired.

243
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,900
I'm...

244
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,540
I'm so tired.

245
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:23,700
I'm so tired.

246
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,240
I'm tired of crashing out.

247
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:33,260
I need my weenie hut junior.

248
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:34,560
I...

249
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,640
I want to be in the weenie hut junior.

250
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,920
I'm tired of this grandpa.

251
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,120
I...

252
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,400
I want...

253
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,340
I want to be in the clouds.

254
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:49,260
I...

255
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:53,180
I need the super weenie hut junior.

256
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:54,900
Just don't cry.

257
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,560
Oh, that's going to make me cry.

258
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,800
That's too damn bad.

259
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:16,460
Anyway, I can't wait for next week where I can be in the super weenie hut junior and relax just like how my boy dad is relaxing right now in his little box.

260
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:16,800
I...

261
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,160
I want to be in my transparent box.

262
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:23,840
When can I be in my transparent box, grandpa?

263
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,280
Wait...

264
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:28,320
My box of comfort.

265
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:32,260
Um...

266
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:36,160
Yes, that's why I said next week is when things get to be chill.

267
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,980
Because I'll be finishing a bunch of other stuff this week.

268
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:41,720
Um...

269
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,620
So I can finally chill next week.

270
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,080
And then I realize...

271
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:46,600
Oh my gosh.

272
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:47,480
Okay, so I'm going to put...

273
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:51,100
Most likely I'm going to put Super Mario Man at a later time.

274
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,260
Uh...

275
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:54,060
Just because like, you know...

276
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,160
Um...

277
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:55,740
Um...

278
00:15:55,740 --> 00:16:00,160
It's a lot of reading and my voice is not ready for a lot of reading right now.

279
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:03,720
I sound like I am just about to hit be reading.

280
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:06,740
Sorry.

281
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:09,000
I sound like I'm...

282
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,260
I'm hitting puberty right now.

283
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,260
Ha ha ha ha ha.

284
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,100
For real.

285
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:18,480
Um...

286
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,400
So we're putting...

287
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,640
And there's a lot of reading.

288
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:21,600
Uh...

289
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,280
So...

290
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:22,680
Um...

291
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:26,960
We're going to put that at the end of the week so I can relax a little bit.

292
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,020
Tomorrow there's no stream.

293
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,260
I'll let you guys know right now.

294
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:30,980
There's going to be no stream tomorrow.

295
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:32,720
Because, um...

296
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,360
Like, you know...

297
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,280
Yesterday I had a stream.

298
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:35,700
Today I have a stream.

299
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:36,920
And usually...

300
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,740
Usually Sunday and Monday are like my rest days.

301
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:40,660
But...

302
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:42,240
You know...

303
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,520
I had obligations.

304
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:44,820
So...

305
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:46,060
Tomorrow...

306
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:46,620
Um...

307
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:47,940
There is no streams.

308
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:48,700
No streams.

309
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,340
Also I found out who...

310
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,960
Who the heck that guy was.

311
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:52,780
Um...

312
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:53,900
Also you guys really don't know.

313
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:57,080
I'm trying not to swear because I'm trying to put my mental barriers up.

314
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:01,900
It takes a while to like rev up the engine for the mental barriers that I am doing a sponsor stream.

315
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,060
So I'm trying not to swear right now.

316
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,380
Just so like...

317
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:09,260
The barrier's up before I go straight into the sponsor.

318
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:11,880
Like...

319
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,320
As you know...

320
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:14,760
As you know...

321
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,680
A lot of them are always like no profanity.

322
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:17,940
I'm like...

323
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:18,780
Gosh darn it.

324
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:19,660
Oh man.

325
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:21,840
Gosh...

326
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,360
Gosh darn it.

327
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:25,280
Don't put the Lord's name in vain.

328
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:26,320
Um...

329
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:30,060
No...

330
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:30,160
Yeah.

331
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,020
No hecking swears.

332
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:33,860
Oh frick.

333
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,120
Anyway.

334
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,240
Uh...

335
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:39,660
Where was I?

336
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:39,860
Okay.

337
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,280
So yesterday...

338
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:46,680
You guys didn't watch yesterday's stream where I had to deal with some movement players yesterday.

339
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,120
I finally...

340
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:53,460
I found out who it was that was trying to do those gosh darn tap strafes on me.

341
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:54,620
Um...

342
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:57,060
And then I shot him down with some shotguns.

343
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:58,060
It was actually...

344
00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:58,580
It was Bullet.

345
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:01,600
For those who don't know Bullet is a pro player um...

346
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,540
in pro league.

347
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,080
So I was like I knew it.

348
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:05,260
I knew you were someone.

349
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:07,880
by...

350
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,320
by killing...

351
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:09,920
Also...

352
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:15,180
but that means by killing a pro that means I'm just as good as a pro player.

353
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:15,620
Guys.

354
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:16,580
I am...

355
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:17,260
Hahahaha!

356
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,380
That means I am just as good!

357
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:23,720
Woo!

358
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,460
Hahahaha!

359
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:27,480
Yes, that is how it works, guys!

360
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:31,720
Everyone knows that's how it works when you kill a pro player.

361
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:36,400
You, you, you absorb their skills and you become them.

362
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:39,260
A dev, a pred, and a pro.

363
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,040
Let's go!

364
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:50,780
Um, also, what's funny, um, was that when we posted that tweet, and I was like, real?

365
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,180
People actually thought I was, I got hired as a dev?

366
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:55,100
Hahahaha!

367
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:58,970
Congratulations!

368
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:03,710
And, and I don't have a, and you know what?

369
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:05,450
I won't say I'm not.

370
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:06,530
Hahahaha!

371
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:08,070
Hahahaha!

372
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:12,730
Because it's on them for not wanting.

373
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:13,990
watching VODs.

374
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:14,770
Hahahaha!

375
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:16,590
Hahahaha!

376
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:21,490
It's, it's on them for not watching streams.

377
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:22,270
Hahahaha!

378
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:27,030
So it is not my duty, uh, to correct them.

379
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:27,930
Hahahaha!

380
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:29,570
Hahahaha!

381
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:31,670
Hahahaha!

382
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:32,510
Hahahaha!

383
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:32,930
Hahahaha!

384
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:33,270
Exactly!

385
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:34,070
Exactly!

386
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:49,490
Um, I'm, I'm like, okay, I'm like, if you guys are wondering what's going on, I'm like lying back on my chair, Right now, my head is up in the ceiling, and I am enjoying life before I'm back in the grind.

387
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:56,170
I'm... I'm... I'm... I'm... I'm peak comfy right now.

388
00:19:57,770 --> 00:20:05,570
Ah... Today is just comfy chatting before we're thrown back into the... to the cog wheel.

389
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:12,310
Until... Until... Back... Back in peace for now.

390
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:15,910
Um... Other life... There's not really much life updates.

391
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:19,010
I mean, nothing really much was happening the last couple of days.

392
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:19,550
Oh, yeah.

393
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:22,630
I was watching Ink Masters, um... Recently.

394
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:25,410
Um... I was watching... Actually... Well, that's a lie.

395
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:28,650
I was watching clips of Ink Masters, because I got... Um...

396
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:33,790
It was a short that showed up about, like, how... Okay, so they called the people...

397
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:39,890
Okay, for those who don't know, um... What Ink Masters is, it is a tattoo reality show.

398
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:49,150
So, it's basically, you know, how, like, you know, America's Next Top Model is basically, like, America's Next Top Tattoo Artist type deal, but they're called Ink Masters.

399
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:53,350
So, I was watching shorts of, like, parodies.

400
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:57,030
Like, a par... Okay, so a parody of, like, Ink Masters showed up.

401
00:20:57,030 --> 00:21:07,310
And it was basically, like, the person they were tattooing was talking about how they wanted all of this stuff for the competition.

402
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:11,430
And then, like, they went, like, I want this, I want this, I want this, I want this.

403
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:13,590
And then the guy was like, that's not possible.

404
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:17,210
And then the person who was getting tattooed was like, I don't care.

405
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:18,610
Like, I want this.

406
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:21,890
And then the tattoo artist was like, yeah, but I can...

407
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:23,710
You're gonna get a really bad tattoo then.

408
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:25,190
And then I'll get eliminated.

409
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:29,090
And then... By the way, they call themselves canvases, by the way.

410
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:31,330
The people were getting their self-tattooed.

411
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:32,830
They're called canvases.

412
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:33,510
Canvases.

413
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:37,690
And then the canvas was like, you know, they dehumanizes them, which is nice.

414
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:46,890
Anyway, the canvases were like, I don't care.

415
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:51,270
And in the comment section, they were like, I thought this was an over-exaggeration.

416
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:54,950
But the first clip I saw literally had that guy.

417
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:57,690
Like, it had an example of that type of canvas.

418
00:21:58,490 --> 00:21:58,970
And...

419
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:02,950
Anyway, so that led me...

420
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:04,210
I was like, wait, this is legit?

421
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:06,910
Like, he wasn't over-exaggerating in this parody?

422
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:12,370
So then it just led me to the rabbit hole of, like, Ink Master clips.

423
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:16,970
And then I just couldn't stop watching for, like, an hour or two of just Ink Master stuff.

424
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:32,970
Um, and it's so interesting because it's like, I think the canvases, it's really interesting for the canvases because, like, to be able to get, like, you know, a permanent tattoo on your body.

425
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:35,710
I mean, I guess you could do, like, laser removal and stuff like that.

426
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:46,750
But to get, like, a permanent tattoo on a competition reality show and, like, still have the ego to demand things is, like, crazy.

427
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:48,250
It's wild to me.

428
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:50,850
Because I'm, like, bro, you are on...

429
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:51,470
They have, like...

430
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:53,650
They're on a time limit, too.

431
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:56,650
And, like, so there's, like, a time limit and stuff.

432
00:22:56,850 --> 00:22:58,510
So, like, the...

433
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:04,310
The mindset of, like, a canvas to be, like, I want all of this within...

434
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:07,010
Within this time limit.

435
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:08,710
And then, like, so...

436
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:13,850
And then, like, if you demand too much because you're supposed to explain what you want during the competition.

437
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:15,430
And then, like...

438
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:18,310
So, like, before you get assigned to a...

439
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:23,070
Before you get assigned to a tattoo artist, you have to say what you want in front of all of them.

440
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:24,510
And then the winner...

441
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:29,730
The winner of the previous challenge will give three of the...

442
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:36,330
Like, two to three of the canvases a skull to signify a death skull.

443
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:39,630
So, like, if the winner, like, hates...

444
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:42,270
Like, wants a particular tattoo artist to win...

445
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:42,770
To lose.

446
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:43,150
To lose.

447
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:43,350
Sorry.

448
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:44,250
To lose.

449
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:48,790
They give, like, the hardest canvases, like, a death skull.

450
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:52,430
And if they get a death skull, they're, like, assigned to, like, one...

451
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:54,490
To tattoo artists they want to lose.

452
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:55,770
And then, so, like...

453
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:58,410
I'm like, that must suck for the canvas.

454
00:23:58,410 --> 00:23:59,670
Because they're, like...

455
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:02,850
It basically tells them when you're handed the death skull, you're, like...

456
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:04,170
You are unreasonable.

457
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:06,990
In front of everyone.

458
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:10,130
Like, in front of, like, the whole world.

459
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:12,430
It's like, you are unreasonable.

460
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:17,590
You have a shit idea.

461
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:18,450
Yeah.

462
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:19,610
Yeah.

463
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:21,210
I was like...

464
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:25,150
And then...

465
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:32,830
But the thing is, some of them would, like, continue to want to still get that tattoo as well.

466
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:34,070
So, it's like...

467
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:39,050
Despite being, like, you know, aired out to, like, all the whole world.

468
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:42,430
That, like, you are an unreasonable client.

469
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:45,490
They're like, I still want this tattoo.

470
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:47,530
I was like...

471
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:49,270
And then...

472
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:49,850
Yeah.

473
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:52,210
And, like...

474
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:56,190
And then, like, not only would they have, like, really bad ideas...

475
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:57,770
Really bad ideas.

476
00:24:58,090 --> 00:25:01,190
Another one is that they would get, like, tattoos in, like...

477
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:03,610
Okay, so, like, apparently one of those, like, I want to...

478
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:06,350
Like, one of the challenges was, like...

479
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:08,050
Um...

480
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:12,750
One of the challenges was, like, I want to get a tattoo on my sternum.

481
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:14,970
So, for those who don't know what sternums are...

482
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:16,410
Like, where the sternum is...

483
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:17,730
It's, like, below your chest.

484
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:19,530
And, like, where your ribs are.

485
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:25,390
And, apparently, it's, like, the most painful area to ever get a tattoo on.

486
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:27,870
So, like, if you ever get a tattoo on a sternum, you...

487
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:28,990
It's the most...

488
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:32,130
The worst idea you can have because it's so painful.

489
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:34,650
And then...

490
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:38,090
The canvas that got the death skull was, like...

491
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:41,250
Oh, the longest I could sit was two hours before...

492
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:41,830
And then...

493
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:43,130
Before I had to give up.

494
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:45,570
And I'm like, why are you here?

495
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:46,590
And then she's like...

496
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:48,390
So, on my sternum...

497
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:56,240
I was just like...

498
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,460
Why is she here?

499
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:01,180
Obviously, she got the death skull.

500
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:08,640
You did not...

501
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,040
I was like, bro...

502
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:13,960
Like, if you are really bad with pain...

503
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:18,780
Maybe, like, do it outside of a reality show?

504
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:20,360
Because, like...

505
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,320
Apparently, you get free tattoos, basically.

506
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,500
Like, the whole reason...

507
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,660
Some of these canvases...

508
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:27,420
I like how I'm dehumanizing them, too.

509
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,640
Because I don't even, like...

510
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,460
I just call them canvases now.

511
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,740
But it's just so much easier.

512
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:35,280
But the whole point of it is that it's a free tattoo.

513
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:37,260
If you get picked.

514
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,880
But still...

515
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:39,460
Like...

516
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:42,980
You can get a really bad free tattoo.

517
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:44,340
Like...

518
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,960
And, like...

519
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,180
There was one...

520
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:51,520
Oh, my God.

521
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:52,480
I was watching a clip.

522
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:52,980
And...

523
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:53,200
Oh, wait.

524
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:53,780
It's 4...

525
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:54,460
4.30.

526
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:55,320
All right.

527
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,220
But to the surprise of...

528
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:57,760
Now...

529
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,240
No one.

530
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:58,860
I don't know.

531
00:26:59,340 --> 00:26:59,920
So...

532
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:00,960
But, uh...

533
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:01,780
It is...

534
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:02,640
4.30.

535
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:05,400
So, that means I can reveal...

536
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:05,540
What?

537
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,540
Oh, my gosh.

538
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:07,860
It is...

539
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:08,340
Overwatch!

540
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:09,180
Yay!

541
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,540
Sorry.

542
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:12,200
Let me explain.

543
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,160
Yes!

544
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:15,440
Yippee!

545
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:17,340
Yeah!

546
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,140
Everyone!

547
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:18,900
Yes!

548
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:21,860
I have been sponsored by Overwatch 2.

549
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:22,760
Or Overwatch.

550
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:23,780
Um...

551
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:26,660
To check out the newest updates for the new season.

552
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,120
Let me turn on...

553
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:30,280
So, what leaked was I had a timer on.

554
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:31,140
And it, like...

555
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:32,540
Accidentally, when I was put...

556
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:34,060
When I was setting up the...

557
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:36,980
The notifications and everything for this.

558
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:37,900
Um...

559
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:40,080
It, like, automatically made...

560
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,180
It automatically made...

561
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:43,540
It automatically updated...

562
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:45,340
So, it leaked out...

563
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:46,660
Instantly...

564
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:48,200
That this was my sponsor.

565
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,680
It auto-update.

566
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:53,260
There it is!

567
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,760
That's the one I was talking about!

568
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:56,620
The stadium is open!

569
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:57,860
Yes!

570
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:58,620
Anyway...

571
00:27:58,620 --> 00:27:59,080
So...

572
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,360
Let me pin this on, too.

573
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:01,120
Yes!

574
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:01,980
Alright!

575
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,100
But, yes...

576
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:15,400
It is really cool to say that I got sponsored by Blizzard and Overwatch to check out the newest update.

577
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:20,000
I haven't played Overwatch in a while, so I didn't even check out Stadium.

578
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:28,120
So a lot of this is going to be incredibly new to me, just because it has been a while since I've played Overwatch.

579
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:39,900
And it's actually crazy to say that I am sponsored by Overwatch, because this is really how I got started streaming in general.

580
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:42,360
My very first stream was an Overwatch stream.

581
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:51,940
And so it's crazy to say that I made it at this point in my career as an indie to be able to be sponsored by them.

582
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:57,900
So yes, let me tweet it out real quick on Twitch today.

583
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,640
Alright, right now.

584
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,380
Alright, boom.

585
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:04,680
Alright, there you go.

586
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:09,040
So yeah, it's like we came full circle.

587
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:15,940
But let me adjust all my Twitch stuff so people will know what it is.

588
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:22,460
This is the hard part of announcing it during stream, because now I have to like...

589
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:28,340
Please, I am... I have been streaming for at least four years, guys.

590
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,480
I'm... Please, I... Be gentle.

591
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:37,560
Guys, professional streamer here.

592
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:41,160
I need to... I need to do all of this now.

593
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,120
Alright, let's see.

594
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:45,440
I need to make sure what the title is correct and everything.

595
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:46,160
Alright.

596
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,680
Oh yeah, and then we have drops, by the way.

597
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,100
Yay, drops.

598
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:51,440
Okay.

599
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,160
Drops.

600
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,700
Check mark emoji.

601
00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:00,020
I think I should have... I should have definitely...

602
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:02,100
Um...

603
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:05,780
I should have definitely, like, had the thing pre-written.

604
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:07,840
Instead of...

605
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,340
Instead of...

606
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:11,220
Um...

607
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:12,500
Instead of writing it live.

608
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:13,180
But it's okay.

609
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:13,900
We're learning.

610
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:14,960
Drops.

611
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:15,820
Yeah, not now, though.

612
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:16,260
Not now.

613
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:17,240
We're not at the category.

614
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,740
Watch the...

615
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:19,140
See...

616
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:20,520
Checking out...

617
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,800
Checking out stadium.

618
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:25,500
And then...

619
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:27,820
Hashtag...

620
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:30,760
Hashtag ad, I believe.

621
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,040
Hashtag...

622
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:35,320
Oh yeah!

623
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,440
Overwatch partner.

624
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:39,560
And then hashtag ad.

625
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:41,040
Yay!

626
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,220
So I won't get in trouble.

627
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:43,980
Yay!

628
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:50,640
So I won't get in trouble.

629
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,280
With the FTC.

630
00:30:59,120 --> 00:30:59,500
Yippee!

631
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,900
So y'all know it's an ad.

632
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:04,840
Ha ha ha ha.

633
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,140
Ha ha ha ha.

634
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:08,240
Um...

635
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,540
Um...

636
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:09,760
Um...

637
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,860
But yeah, it is...

638
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:13,160
Quite surreal to be sponsored.

639
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,020
Um...

640
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:15,740
By Overwatch.

641
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,020
Like I said...

642
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:18,280
Um...

643
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,700
This is, like, a full circle for me.

644
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:21,780
Um...

645
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:23,240
If you ever check my...

646
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,720
I guess, like, my Twitch tracker...

647
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,300
You see...

648
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:28,640
How many hours I have streamed Overwatch...

649
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,340
During...

650
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:29,500
On...

651
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:30,560
On Twitch alone.

652
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:31,620
Um...

653
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:32,020
Um...

654
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:32,620
And now...

655
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:34,220
I get paid to play Overwatch!

656
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:35,180
Let's go!

657
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:36,540
Ha ha ha ha!

658
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:38,720
Ha ha ha ha!

659
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,040
Um...

660
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:40,540
Anyway...

661
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:42,240
Back to the Ink Master story.

662
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,220
Because we're not starting yet, by the way.

663
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:44,860
Uh...

664
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:45,980
Back to Ink Masters.

665
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:47,820
Um...

666
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:48,280
Okay.

667
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,080
Where was I?

668
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:49,400
Oh yeah.

669
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:50,020
So...

670
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:52,180
I was watching one particular clip.

671
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:53,480
And...

672
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:53,700
Uh...

673
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:58,660
One of the clips was talking about how the tattoo was gonna be on the face.

674
00:31:58,940 --> 00:31:59,580
So...

675
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:01,400
Obviously, everyone was like...

676
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,760
Oh my god.

677
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:04,320
Face tattoos.

678
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:07,020
Cause it's obviously, like, you know...

679
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:07,440
The...

680
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,520
One of the most sensitive areas...

681
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,740
Of everything.

682
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,820
And, like, how...

683
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:13,960
How, like...

684
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:17,000
How much, like, potential it can go wrong.

685
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,600
Especially on the face.

686
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,080
And then, so, like...

687
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,500
One of the guy...

688
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:22,940
That wanted a...

689
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:24,540
Tattoo on the...

690
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:25,320
On the face.

691
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,060
Slash head.

692
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:28,300
By the way, it's, like, all parts of the head.

693
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:28,840
So, like...

694
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:31,440
It can go all the way to the side of the head and everything.

695
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:32,900
And...

696
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,120
Um...

697
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:35,140
And...

698
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:35,640
So...

699
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,500
The guy was like...

700
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,520
I want a Grim Reaper...

701
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,180
Riding a metal horse.

702
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:42,840
And, um...

703
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,760
Having a long sword...

704
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,220
That goes all the way here.

705
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:48,240
And I want the horse to be metallic.

706
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,960
And I...

707
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,360
And I was like...

708
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,660
Bro, it's on a face.

709
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:55,420
Yeah!

710
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:56,300
Yeah!

711
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:59,500
Obviously, guess who got the death skull?

712
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:00,760
I...

713
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:04,740
I wonder...

714
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:07,960
Who got the death skull in that challenge?

715
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,280
Um...

716
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:09,840
And...

717
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,220
With time constraints, too.

718
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,960
With time constraints.

719
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,140
And...

720
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:16,560
Bro, just do a tear or something.

721
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,780
And then...

722
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:22,800
Obviously, the tattoo artist was like...

723
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,000
We're not doing that.

724
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:25,520
And then he was like...

725
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,440
Okay, he's like...

726
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,740
Choose one thing.

727
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,440
And then the canvas was like...

728
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,340
Okay, I want a metallic horse.

729
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:35,080
And then the tattoo artist was like...

730
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:35,580
No!

731
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:41,020
Look at the sick Grim Reaper I sketched out.

732
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,920
Like, doesn't this Grim Reaper look so cool?

733
00:33:52,100 --> 00:34:04,160
And so, um, so, and the canvas was like, but I, but, like, I sort of really wanted the metallic horse.

734
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:07,620
And then the tattoo artist was like, we don't have time for that.

735
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:17,340
But also, uh, crew, thank you for the tier 1 stuff.

736
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,660
Thank you.

737
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:25,620
Anyway, so it was really funny because the guy, like, he was like, okay, so the tattoo artist was like, obviously, he was like an old veteran.

738
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:28,200
He's like, he's been in the business for, like, 20 plus years.

739
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:36,020
And he was like, he was like, he was like, I am not taking any, I am not letting this one guy ruin my chances.

740
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:42,860
I, I will convince him to not do the metallic horse.

741
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:47,240
Oh, yeah.

742
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:50,140
And then, so, yeah, it looked really cool though.

743
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:54,140
It looked really cool when they went with the tattoo, like, when we went with the Grim Reaper.

744
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:58,200
Like, I was gonna say, like, how, how the heck are you gonna do, like, a metallic horse?

745
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:05,520
The Grim Reaper with a giant-ass sword riding a metallic horse on the face.

746
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:11,240
I was like, how would all of that fit on the goddamn head slash face?

747
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:16,300
And, I was like, thank God they swapped, changed it.

748
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:28,920
Um, um, anyway, anyway, so, uh, um, another thing on that show, there was one where, uh, oh my god.

749
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:33,940
There was one where, oh my god, I'm trying to remember exactly what it was.

750
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:36,880
Oh, yeah, it was for the sternum.

751
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,920
And, obviously, it's super painful.

752
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:42,120
Oh my god, I'm trying to say, what was it called?

753
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,120
The mandala?

754
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:44,260
Mandala?

755
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:51,760
Okay, so, one of the person wanted a mandala on the sternum.

756
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:59,200
And, obviously, like, yeah, so they wanted, it's like a type of flower, I believe.

757
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:02,740
Yeah, it's a, it's like a type of, like, flower design.

758
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:07,500
Um, so they wanted a mandala flower on the sternum.

759
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:17,720
Um, and then the tattoo artist was like, the mandala is, obviously, she got the death skull.

760
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:47,330
And, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah,

761
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:51,930
ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah A rose tattoo.

762
00:36:54,010 --> 00:36:55,710
Same, but yeah.

763
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:59,590
So, oh man, not as cliche or common.

764
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:01,450
How is that?

765
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:05,050
It's because he didn't want to do a mandala.

766
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:10,590
Because, like, the mandala is, like, really difficult to do on the sternum.

767
00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:12,110
Because it's a lot of details.

768
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:15,170
It's literally speech a thousand.

769
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:19,230
But then the rose would be easier to tattoo.

770
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:24,210
Like... I thought that was so funny.

771
00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:26,410
They're like, yeah, like, we should do a rose.

772
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:30,550
It's less common than a mandala.

773
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:39,590
I thought that was... I thought that was really funny.

774
00:37:39,850 --> 00:37:42,130
Anyway, you guys should check out Ink Masters.

775
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:45,210
Not sponsored by Ink Masters, by the way.

776
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:51,630
I... I just... So you guys know, I am not sponsored by Ink Masters.

777
00:37:51,850 --> 00:37:54,270
I just thought it was very...

778
00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:59,930
It was... It was a very enjoy... Like, I was even... I was just watching clips, too.

779
00:38:00,050 --> 00:38:01,570
But it was very enjoyable.

780
00:38:07,330 --> 00:38:14,210
So, um... I would highly suggest... It's actually, like, good... Like, good time... Like, good time... Way to kill time.

781
00:38:14,850 --> 00:38:17,870
Um... Even though I shouldn't be procrastinating yesterday.

782
00:38:22,330 --> 00:38:24,730
I used to watch it, but I got tired of all the drama.

783
00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:26,570
I mean, it's a reality show.

784
00:38:26,790 --> 00:38:28,630
It's a... It's a reality show.

785
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:32,970
So, like, obviously, they have to, like, make sure, um...

786
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:34,290
There's drama and everything.

787
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:35,950
Just so it makes people watch.

788
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:37,750
But honestly, you can just consume the clips.

789
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:41,670
The clips were just... Worked just as well as the normal drama.

790
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:46,410
Like, the clips work just as well to, like, watch in general.

791
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:50,710
There's one compilation where it was, like, the worst tattoos ever received.

792
00:38:50,970 --> 00:38:53,830
And... In Ink Masters.

793
00:38:54,070 --> 00:39:00,510
And I'm like, man, it must really suck to be that one of the canvases featured in...

794
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:04,630
In... In that... In that clip compilation.

795
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:06,030
Because I'm wondering...

796
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:10,530
Do they, like, get free laser tattoo removal then?

797
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:13,570
Like...

798
00:39:13,570 --> 00:39:17,170
Like, if, you know, you got one of the worst ones...

799
00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:20,170
Do they get free tattoo laser removal?

800
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:22,730
I paid for it by the show?

801
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:24,630
Because it's, like...

802
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:25,130
Like...

803
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:28,630
I guess it might be your fault if you were one of the death skulls.

804
00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:29,230
Oh, yeah.

805
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:31,270
I remember there was one version where he...

806
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:35,030
They were like, I want a tattoo of my dead spouse.

807
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:37,910
But I want it all in green.

808
00:39:38,330 --> 00:39:40,070
And I was like, what?

809
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:42,010
I was like...

810
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:47,430
They wanted a portrait of their dead spouse on their leg.

811
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:48,750
But green.

812
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:50,130
I'm like, what?

813
00:39:50,210 --> 00:39:51,590
So he could look like Shrek?

814
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:52,570
Like...

815
00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:53,550
I was like...

816
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:54,890
Why green?

817
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:57,410
It was like monochromatic tattoo.

818
00:39:59,090 --> 00:39:59,690
Like...

819
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:06,830
Yeah, but it was all in green.

820
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:08,890
So I was like...

821
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:09,390
What?

822
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:11,090
Is it going to look like Shrek or something?

823
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:13,890
And then the tattoo artist was obviously like...

824
00:40:13,890 --> 00:40:14,190
What?

825
00:40:14,330 --> 00:40:15,950
How about we don't do green?

826
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:19,450
What if we do red?

827
00:40:23,610 --> 00:40:25,090
I was like...

828
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:25,490
Like what?

829
00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:26,150
Like a...

830
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:27,170
Like a...

831
00:40:28,110 --> 00:40:28,590
Ghostbuster...

832
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:30,350
Slime ghost or something?

833
00:40:30,610 --> 00:40:31,790
I think it's not...

834
00:40:31,790 --> 00:40:33,670
It's not going to glow in the dark.

835
00:40:33,770 --> 00:40:34,130
Exactly.

836
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:36,150
It's not going to glow in the dark or something.

837
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:38,010
Also, I forgot to mention.

838
00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:40,110
If you see the title, it's exclamation point Overwatch.

839
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:47,970
So you use the exclamation point Overwatch to bring up the command for the sponsor.

840
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:48,910
Yeah.

841
00:40:49,350 --> 00:40:50,610
Also, by the way...

842
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:50,810
Sorry.

843
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:52,170
This is like a little...

844
00:40:52,170 --> 00:40:54,130
You cannot skip this ad, by the way.

845
00:40:56,650 --> 00:40:58,290
Anyway, there is a cool down for it.

846
00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:05,870
But what I was going to say was that if you click on the link, it really does help out a lot and support the stream.

847
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:09,950
Sorry.

848
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:12,990
Look, I had to watch YouTube with ads, okay?

849
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:14,050
So...

850
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:15,450
This is...

851
00:41:15,450 --> 00:41:16,490
You know, it's like...

852
00:41:16,490 --> 00:41:19,250
This is my YouTube ad insert.

853
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:20,450
For you...

854
00:41:20,450 --> 00:41:24,870
In the middle of the video, you just get a random ad on your mobile phone.

855
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:25,710
That's me.

856
00:41:25,890 --> 00:41:26,610
This is the stream.

857
00:41:26,850 --> 00:41:28,110
If I had to watch...

858
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:31,090
Watch the compilation with ads.

859
00:41:31,470 --> 00:41:31,950
I...

860
00:41:34,330 --> 00:41:37,410
I'm giving you my own ad for my recap.

861
00:41:37,530 --> 00:41:38,810
Just because you get...

862
00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:41,310
Don't think you get a free recap, guys.

863
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:45,800
Don't...

864
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:47,640
Don't think that.

865
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:48,780
All right.

866
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,520
I think like...

867
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:51,800
Okay.

868
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,580
So, for like the...

869
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:55,220
Um...

870
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:56,720
For like the...

871
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:57,220
Uh...

872
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:57,940
Overwatch...

873
00:41:57,940 --> 00:41:58,340
Uh...

874
00:41:58,340 --> 00:41:58,900
Overwatch 2.

875
00:41:59,060 --> 00:41:59,460
Uh...

876
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:00,460
In like 15 minutes.

877
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:02,500
Um...

878
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:03,800
I need you guys to know.

879
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:04,700
It has been...

880
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:08,720
The last time I touched Overwatch was before Stadium was released.

881
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:09,280
Which...

882
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,180
I mean, it wasn't that long ago.

883
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:10,780
But like...

884
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:11,860
Even before then.

885
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:14,100
It was like a couple of months.

886
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:15,300
Um...

887
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:15,640
So...

888
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:17,040
I know they have a new hero.

889
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:19,480
And the new hero is like...

890
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:20,300
Um...

891
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:22,160
It's like basically like...

892
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,340
Like she uses...

893
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:24,640
I believe in...

894
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:24,920
Uh...

895
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:25,480
Crossbow.

896
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:26,620
And...

897
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:27,000
Oh my gosh.

898
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:28,440
There's like a lot of new stuff about it.

899
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:29,520
I'm trying to like...

900
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,600
Remember on top of my head.

901
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:31,400
Uh...

902
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:31,820
But...

903
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:33,020
There's like a lot of new skins.

904
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:33,580
A lot of new...

905
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:35,700
The thing I do like about Overwatch...

906
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:36,400
Is that...

907
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,500
The skin collaborations...

908
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:39,440
Is very...

909
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,640
Is really interesting.

910
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:41,340
Cause...

911
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:42,460
They have...

912
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:44,060
A lot of...

913
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:46,060
Really cool skin collaborations.

914
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:47,220
And I heard that...

915
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:49,680
The newest skin collaborations they're doing...

916
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:50,880
Is...

917
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:51,540
Uh...

918
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:52,180
Gundam.

919
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:53,460
For their anniversary.

920
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:55,420
And they gave Mercy...

921
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,660
They gave Mercy...

922
00:42:57,660 --> 00:42:59,160
The main Gundam skin.

923
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:01,480
I...

924
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:02,160
I...

925
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:05,920
I thought that was...

926
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,860
I thought that was funny.

927
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:10,580
I thought it was funny that Mercy was the new Gundam.

928
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:10,760
Gundam.

929
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:18,380
There's obviously other characters, but they gave... Yeah, they gave her as she... Exactly.

930
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:20,940
As she deserves, okay?

931
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:25,080
You know, the classic one.

932
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:26,460
The classic Gundam.

933
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:28,600
I want to pilot her.

934
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,560
Prom Queen, thank you for that tier one sub.

935
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:32,880
Thank you.

936
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:33,620
Thank you.

937
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:35,140
I really appreciate it.

938
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:38,620
Oh, is it Gundam?

939
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:38,860
Yeah.

940
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:41,920
So, there's also other collaborations and everything.

941
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:43,580
And then, you know what's funny?

942
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:44,500
I was looking on Twitter.

943
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:46,200
And someone was like, oh man.

944
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:52,180
Because they announced Doki Watch, I thought they were doing a sponsored collaboration with Doki.

945
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:53,360
Well then!

946
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:55,700
Yes, they are!

947
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:59,100
So for those who don't know.

948
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:01,580
Well, well, well.

949
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:04,920
Look what we have here.

950
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,780
Doki Watch is real.

951
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:12,140
Little do they know.

952
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:15,780
They are sponsoring me.

953
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:20,900
Well, well, well.

954
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,880
So for those who don't know what Doki Watch is, it's basically...

955
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:30,520
It's like their whole... They're doing a magical girl, like, collaborate... Not collaboration, sorry.

956
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:31,380
It's like their own thing.

957
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:34,360
They're doing a magical girl, like, arc in Overwatch.

958
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:36,060
So there's, like, magical girl skins.

959
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:41,460
And, um, a bunch of magical girl cosmetics right now for Doki Watch.

960
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:42,540
And...

961
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:46,160
And there's also, like, I believe they're doing, like, some...

962
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:50,560
Um, like, some little, like, storyline that they're doing on Twitter as well as social media.

963
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:51,780
From what I've seen.

964
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:52,340
But yes!

965
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:53,240
Mahou Shoujo!

966
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:54,080
Yes!

967
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:58,020
There's, uh, magical girl outfits right now in Overwatch too.

968
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:00,600
Um, so yeah, we're gonna look at those as well.

969
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:01,920
That's why it's called Doki Watch.

970
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:02,960
Cause, like, Doki Doki.

971
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:04,200
And then, yeah!

972
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:06,160
That's why, yeah, so...

973
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:08,460
Uh, so that's why they're doing a little...

974
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:09,640
They called it Doki Watch.

975
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:11,000
And I thought it was really...

976
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,020
By the way...

977
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:16,520
When Doki Watch was first announced, like, there was nothing regarding me collab...

978
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:18,220
Like, being sponsored by Overwatch.

979
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:21,520
So, like, it was nice to find out that I was...

980
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:24,480
I was gonna be sponsored by Overwatch later.

981
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,220
And I was like, oh, the timing was so perfect.

982
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:28,100
You know, since, you know, I'm Doki.

983
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:30,840
And I'm gonna be talking about Doki Watch.

984
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:35,680
It was... Yeah, it was perfect timing too.

985
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:40,020
My first Overwatch sponsor, um, um, as Doki.

986
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:44,020
Uh, well, technically, it's not my first first Overwatch sponsor but like...

987
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:46,540
You know, my first Overwatch sponsor as Doki.

988
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:57,340
Um, and, um, the prophecy has been fulfilled.

989
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:01,060
Uh, so full circle, yeah.

990
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:05,480
Um, it was nice.

991
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:06,860
It's just nice to...

992
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:11,100
You know, just another thing to check off my little list of stuff.

993
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:15,860
Um, that I really wanted to accomplish as Doki.

994
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:17,860
So, I'm really happy about that.

995
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:21,240
Um, what else?

996
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:27,500
What else can I do for... for, uh... uh... life update?

997
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:28,840
Oh yeah, you know what's funny?

998
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:33,100
I saw that... I saw that, uh...

999
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:41,020
I saw that Gordon Ramsay brought Hell's Kitchen to Roblox.

1000
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:44,100
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1001
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:51,920
Okay, Roblox has had some... really... lots of insane collaboration recently.

1002
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:53,480
I don't know if you guys noticed it.

1003
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:56,180
Yeah, so... so not only was there like...

1004
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:59,760
Oh yeah, by the way, I've like saved... wait, do I still have that Twitter account?

1005
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:05,240
I know I like saved it on my... I saved it on my, uh...

1006
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:08,940
Well, I didn't save it, but like, I have it on my browser.

1007
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:12,480
And I've been keeping it on my browser just to be like, remember this.

1008
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:16,040
Remember to check back on my end to make sure...

1009
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:16,560
Oh, yeah.

1010
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:17,320
The end.

1011
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:19,940
So, I've been... Remember when I told you guys about...

1012
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:20,960
Wait, is it out yet?

1013
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:23,260
Enter... Oh, my God.

1014
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:24,800
The end is out now.

1015
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:26,020
Oh, my God.

1016
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:26,680
Okay, guys.

1017
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:28,420
I've always wanted to, like...

1018
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:32,100
I've wanted to check out the end for Roblox.

1019
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:36,460
Because it's like... Okay, so for those who don't know, this game...

1020
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:37,200
This...

1021
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:45,340
This game is made by the developers...

1022
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:48,940
By the creators of Chainsaw Man.

1023
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:50,660
And what was it?

1024
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:51,100
I forgot.

1025
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:54,240
It was Chainsaw Man and something else.

1026
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:55,700
I don't remember who...

1027
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:56,840
The director.

1028
00:47:56,980 --> 00:47:59,280
Yeah, it was made by the director of Chainsaw Man.

1029
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:00,820
And what was the other one?

1030
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:02,940
He did other stuff, too.

1031
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:04,880
But that was, like, one of the biggest things.

1032
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,980
And the...

1033
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:10,980
And I was waiting for this game to come out for the longest time.

1034
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:13,860
Because they have, like, actual, like...

1035
00:48:14,780 --> 00:48:15,460
Famous...

1036
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:16,360
Uh...

1037
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:18,720
Japanese voice actors.

1038
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:19,780
So...

1039
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:23,160
One of the Japanese voice actors they got...

1040
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:25,560
Was the one who voice-act...

1041
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:26,680
Nezuko...

1042
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:28,140
In Demon Slayer.

1043
00:48:28,580 --> 00:48:29,200
So they...

1044
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:30,840
So they...

1045
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:32,440
And then the other one...

1046
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:35,700
Was the one who did Bochi from Bochi Rock.

1047
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:36,960
And...

1048
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:37,040
Yeah!

1049
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:38,380
So I'm like...

1050
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:39,260
I was like...

1051
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:41,880
This is a Roblox game, sir.

1052
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:42,760
They...

1053
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:46,660
What is this cast?

1054
00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:46,960
Yes!

1055
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:47,540
Yes!

1056
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:49,800
So I've been, like...

1057
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:50,600
Um...

1058
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:51,660
Yeah!

1059
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:52,700
They've been...

1060
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:53,980
Getting, like...

1061
00:48:53,980 --> 00:48:55,220
Actual, like...

1062
00:48:55,220 --> 00:48:56,820
Top tier voice actors.

1063
00:48:57,220 --> 00:48:59,040
Or voice actresses.

1064
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:00,140
And...

1065
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:00,980
Um...

1066
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:01,480
And...

1067
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:03,740
And...

1068
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:05,300
And, like...

1069
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:07,040
Obviously, the creative Chainsaw.

1070
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:07,520
Like...

1071
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:07,720
Oh!

1072
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:08,680
And JJK, too.

1073
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:09,280
Oh, yeah!

1074
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:11,220
They did JJK and...

1075
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:11,740
And...

1076
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:12,480
Chainsaw Man.

1077
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:14,320
Like, the director for it.

1078
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:15,200
Um...

1079
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:15,540
So, yeah!

1080
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:17,600
So I've been really curious...

1081
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:19,460
How this game is gonna be...

1082
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:20,480
Because it's, like...

1083
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:20,980
How...

1084
00:49:20,980 --> 00:49:22,240
You know...

1085
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:23,780
It's Roblox!

1086
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:25,880
But...

1087
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:28,320
I also heard...

1088
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:30,580
That they're also going really...

1089
00:49:30,580 --> 00:49:31,460
Hard...

1090
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:33,780
Like, on VTubers in general.

1091
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:34,240
On...

1092
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:36,120
Especially on JP's side.

1093
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:37,640
Because...

1094
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:38,300
Uh...

1095
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:40,920
Because, apparently, from what I'm told...

1096
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:43,880
Roblox's popularity in Japan...

1097
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:45,640
Is skyrocketing.

1098
00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:47,280
So...

1099
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:48,480
Obviously...

1100
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:49,520
Because, you know...

1101
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:52,960
Whenever a game gets really, really popular in Japan...

1102
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:54,620
Companies go hard.

1103
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:55,300
You know?

1104
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:56,700
So, like...

1105
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:57,160
Um...

1106
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:58,020
I know they, like...

1107
00:49:58,020 --> 00:49:59,820
They're starting to collaborate...

1108
00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:01,420
With a lot of...

1109
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:02,100
They're trying to...

1110
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:04,620
They're starting to collaborate with VTubers right now...

1111
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:04,980
For...

1112
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:06,320
For Roblox and stuff...

1113
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:06,560
On...

1114
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:06,920
In Japan.

1115
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:09,360
So, I thought that was really interesting.

1116
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:12,040
So, now I notice why...

1117
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:12,320
The...

1118
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:12,780
Why...

1119
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:14,720
They're making the end...

1120
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,520
Right now...

1121
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:17,360
Yeah...

1122
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:17,780
Yeah...

1123
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:18,890
It's my time...

1124
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:22,300
Ha ha ha ha...

1125
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:22,700
Ha ha ha...

1126
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:23,060
Yeah...

1127
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:25,980
Official Roblox X VTuber collabs...

1128
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:27,280
Are starting to...

1129
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:28,600
On the rise right now in Japan.

1130
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,380
So, that's why we have...

1131
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:31,160
Literally...

1132
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:31,880
The...

1133
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:33,260
The development for...

1134
00:50:33,260 --> 00:50:34,680
The end was...

1135
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:36,720
That went crazy hard.

1136
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,000
Ha ha ha...

1137
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:42,060
That's a crazy sentence to say.

1138
00:50:42,620 --> 00:50:44,140
Hey, I don't make the rules here.

1139
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:46,420
Ha ha ha...

1140
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:47,140
All right.

1141
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:47,920
Let me go.

1142
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:51,320
Since it's almost time...

1143
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:52,340
Let me set up...

1144
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:54,520
My stream real quick for this.

1145
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:56,660
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba.

1146
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:57,300
All right.

1147
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:58,060
Yeah.

1148
00:50:58,860 --> 00:50:59,400
All right.

1149
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:00,120
Here I am.

1150
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:00,840
Hello, everybody.

1151
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:01,180
Hello.

1152
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:01,640
That's me.

1153
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:02,660
Ha ha ha.

1154
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:03,220
Hello.

1155
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:03,900
It's me, Dookie.

1156
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:04,740
Hello, everybody.

1157
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:06,240
All right.

1158
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:07,180
Oops.

1159
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:08,020
That's not it.

1160
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:09,140
Ha ha ha.

1161
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:09,620
Oops.

1162
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:10,260
Ha ha ha.

1163
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:11,060
Sorry.

1164
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:13,640
It was just for three seconds.

1165
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:16,240
Guys, it was just for three seconds.

1166
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:17,500
I...

1167
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:17,680
Ha ha ha.

1168
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:18,560
Oh my...

1169
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:19,480
Ha ha ha.

1170
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:23,380
Sorry.

1171
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:24,240
I got this.

1172
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:24,720
Professional.

1173
00:51:24,740 --> 00:51:26,200
I've been streaming for at least four years.

1174
00:51:26,620 --> 00:51:26,820
All right.

1175
00:51:27,140 --> 00:51:28,040
Ha ha ha.

1176
00:51:29,020 --> 00:51:29,580
All right.

1177
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:30,020
Let's see.

1178
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:32,100
Let me put this here.

1179
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:38,260
I don't know what it covers because it's been a while since I've, uh, I booted up.

1180
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:40,140
Guys, it's not five yet.

1181
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:41,740
Guys, it's not five yet.

1182
00:51:41,740 --> 00:51:43,220
I still have time.

1183
00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:46,900
I can make little mistakes before it hits 5 p.m.

1184
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:47,340
Guys.

1185
00:51:47,660 --> 00:51:48,300
I...

1186
00:51:50,380 --> 00:51:51,680
I can...

1187
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:55,260
I can make small mistakes before it hits 5.

1188
00:51:55,620 --> 00:51:56,380
I...

1189
00:51:57,700 --> 00:51:59,780
Five more minutes.

1190
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:05,220
All right.

1191
00:52:08,170 --> 00:52:08,670
All right.

1192
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:12,210
Let me blow my nose real quick and stay hydrated first, guys.

1193
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:18,160
Category has yet to be changed, guys.

1194
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:19,400
I still have time.

1195
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:21,640
I haven't changed the category yet.

1196
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:22,360
Guys.

1197
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:24,840
I was talking about Roblox earlier, chat.

1198
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:30,320
Oh, yeah.

1199
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:35,840
I might need Soundguy's help for this because I haven't done an Overwatch stream in a long time.

1200
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:38,200
So, I don't know what the sound would be.

1201
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:39,080
Let me double check.

1202
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:41,560
Let me double streaming on...

1203
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:41,900
Oh, I do.

1204
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:42,280
Never mind.

1205
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:45,660
JK, Soundguy, I don't need you no more.

1206
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:48,260
JK, I didn't mean that, Soundguy.

1207
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:48,620
Please.

1208
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:51,060
You did a great job.

1209
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:54,960
I didn't mean that, Soundguy.

1210
00:52:56,060 --> 00:52:56,820
I swear.

1211
00:52:57,360 --> 00:53:00,080
I bet he wasn't even here to hear that anyway, so it's okay.

1212
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:03,720
It's okay.

1213
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:04,520
I have a record.

1214
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:06,900
I found out I did have a record of...

1215
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:09,840
Of Overwatch for it.

1216
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:11,900
Oh, wait.

1217
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:13,040
They have hero bands now.

1218
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:16,220
Bands.

1219
00:53:16,540 --> 00:53:17,280
Oh, wait.

1220
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:18,900
I forgot they have hero bands.

1221
00:53:19,060 --> 00:53:20,100
Oh, what's funny?

1222
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:24,980
Is that people are now, like, like, even when you...

1223
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:27,100
Okay, so, like, they got their streamer mode.

1224
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:29,240
Because, like, there's hero bands now.

1225
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:32,160
And then, I know some people are gonna, like, remember...

1226
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:35,220
Are gonna start to remember, like, names and stuff.

1227
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:36,400
And levels and stuff.

1228
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:38,620
Who are you looking forward to banning?

1229
00:53:38,620 --> 00:53:40,900
I can't say, because it's pretty negative.

1230
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:41,920
I can't...

1231
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:48,540
I'm trying to be positive here.

1232
00:53:59,620 --> 00:54:02,080
Some people in chat are correct.

1233
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:03,340
Some people...

1234
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,580
See, I'm not the one being toxic here.

1235
00:54:08,980 --> 00:54:09,260
Okay?

1236
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:10,720
It's not me.

1237
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:13,260
That's being toxic.

1238
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:14,540
Oh, man.

1239
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:16,200
Oh, yes.

1240
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:17,540
I know about the perk system.

1241
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:18,760
I've actually...

1242
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:24,020
I've, like, played a bit of Overwatch when the perk systems were first introduced.

1243
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:25,440
And they were all, like, really interesting.

1244
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:29,240
I know, like, some of you guys might not have been on Overwatch in a long time.

1245
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:31,140
Yeah, some of you guys are like, there's a perk system now?

1246
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:32,500
Yes, I know.

1247
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:36,740
So, but when I heard about the perk system, I went in to check it out myself.

1248
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:39,700
Because, you know, obviously, like, I was like, there's a perk system?

1249
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:41,940
So, it's actually really interesting.

1250
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:43,680
I'll show some of the perk system for you guys.

1251
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:45,960
Because I know some of you guys have not seen it before.

1252
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:49,020
So, you know what?

1253
00:54:49,060 --> 00:54:49,960
I think it's time.

1254
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:51,120
I'll start a little early.

1255
00:54:51,380 --> 00:54:52,560
I think it's all right.

1256
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:53,240
All right.

1257
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:54,300
Overwatch.

1258
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:56,320
Overwatch 2.

1259
00:54:57,220 --> 00:54:57,800
All right.

1260
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:01,720
Let me make sure.

1261
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:05,840
I have everything here.

1262
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:07,120
All right.

1263
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:08,440
Battle.net.

1264
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:12,140
Guys, I even updated my game before I started my stream.

1265
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:14,200
That's how you know I'm being very professional.

1266
00:55:18,020 --> 00:55:18,820
All right.

1267
00:55:19,140 --> 00:55:20,280
Back to my roots.

1268
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:22,160
Whoops.

1269
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:24,840
Dookie, why?

1270
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:25,240
Whoops.

1271
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:26,960
Because I forgot to do this.

1272
00:55:27,460 --> 00:55:28,680
Back to my roots.

1273
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:33,000
Get in here, everyone.

1274
00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:35,580
We're back to my origin.

1275
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:37,980
It's Dookie from four years ago.

1276
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:39,960
Or five years ago.

1277
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:41,080
All right.

1278
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:42,900
So, look at that.

1279
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:43,140
Oh, wait.

1280
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:43,900
You guys can't even see it.

1281
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:44,400
You're covering.

1282
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:44,840
Wait.

1283
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:45,460
Don't look at that.

1284
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:46,720
I just realized it's...

1285
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:49,080
Oh, wait.

1286
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:50,340
Thank God you guys covered it.

1287
00:55:50,540 --> 00:55:51,260
Oh, nice.

1288
00:55:51,260 --> 00:55:52,140
You guys covered it.

1289
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:52,680
Thank God.

1290
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:53,860
I was gonna...

1291
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:56,900
Because, like, when you hover, it shows, like, my...

1292
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:58,860
It shows my numbers.

1293
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:00,380
And I was like, don't look at it.

1294
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:00,820
No.

1295
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:06,220
Keep talking.

1296
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:07,420
It covers it all.

1297
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:08,920
You're the sensor.

1298
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:12,240
So no one can see.

1299
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:13,240
Um.

1300
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:14,320
Whoa.

1301
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:14,780
Okay.

1302
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:15,160
Oh, look.

1303
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:15,900
There's a Gundam.

1304
00:56:16,180 --> 00:56:16,460
Oh, my.

1305
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:16,680
Okay.

1306
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:17,920
The Gundam skins are really cool.

1307
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:18,080
Wait.

1308
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:19,480
I actually want to look at the Gundam skins.

1309
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:21,380
Uh...

1310
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:21,940
There you go.

1311
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:23,200
What's this?

1312
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:25,120
Whoa.

1313
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:30,220
Too bad.

1314
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:30,740
I'm gonna bat.

1315
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:36,520
You're like, can't wait to show my Gundam skin.

1316
00:56:44,340 --> 00:56:45,800
It's so cool.

1317
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:48,820
This mobile suit can defeat any enemy.

1318
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:51,600
I'm the Grim Reaper.

1319
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:52,620
Oh.

1320
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:54,040
Oh.

1321
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:55,720
Wait.

1322
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:56,780
I remember that Gundam.

1323
00:57:03,870 --> 00:57:05,270
It looks really good.

1324
00:57:05,450 --> 00:57:08,610
I think, like, Overwatch is really good at making nice skins.

1325
00:57:09,990 --> 00:57:11,450
And it has, like, community.

1326
00:57:11,710 --> 00:57:15,670
You can vote as a community, too, for the next skins and stuff, which is nice.

1327
00:57:22,590 --> 00:57:24,030
Oh, look at the...

1328
00:57:24,030 --> 00:57:24,810
It's that guy.

1329
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:31,820
Good enough.

1330
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:33,000
Yeah.

1331
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:34,480
Thank you for the tier one sub.

1332
00:57:34,620 --> 00:57:34,820
Thank you.

1333
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:35,260
Thank you.

1334
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:36,040
Broken Blonde.

1335
00:57:36,140 --> 00:57:37,660
Thank you for the $10.

1336
00:57:38,140 --> 00:57:38,340
Thank you.

1337
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:38,800
Thank you.

1338
00:57:38,860 --> 00:57:41,000
This is for YouTube premium only, Doki.

1339
00:57:41,180 --> 00:57:45,040
No one should ever have to watch YouTube ads again.

1340
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:47,600
But, yeah.

1341
00:57:49,180 --> 00:57:53,360
I think the Gundam skins look so good, honestly.

1342
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:56,240
I think, like, every collaboration they do.

1343
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:57,960
Like, you know, they did, like...

1344
00:57:57,960 --> 00:57:59,480
I know they did My Hero Academia.

1345
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:00,420
They did Avatar.

1346
00:58:00,860 --> 00:58:01,620
They did...

1347
00:58:01,620 --> 00:58:02,880
Like, now they did Gundam.

1348
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:03,860
They did...

1349
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:07,460
They did so many that, like, it's hard to, like, keep track anymore.

1350
00:58:07,460 --> 00:58:11,000
But, I know, like, a lot of them are always...

1351
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,160
Like, skins are, like, just really, really good.

1352
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:17,360
And they're, like, very faithful to the adaptations.

1353
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:19,340
And, like, especially the characters they pick.

1354
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:25,080
You know, I definitely see Mercy as Gundam Wing Zero.

1355
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:26,860
Honestly, a good pick.

1356
00:58:27,540 --> 00:58:28,020
Oh, yeah.

1357
00:58:28,100 --> 00:58:29,020
They did Cowboy Bebop.

1358
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:29,360
Oh, yeah.

1359
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:30,860
They did Cowboy Bebop, too.

1360
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:34,340
Oh, um...

1361
00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:34,740
What is this?

1362
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:37,140
I actually want to watch this trailer for Stadium.

1363
00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:38,740
That was, like, one of the biggest...

1364
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:41,360
The big launch they had.

1365
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:44,220
So, for those who don't know, this is a new game mode that they have.

1366
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:45,380
The new rank mode, as well.

1367
00:58:45,460 --> 00:58:47,320
Everyone says it's, like, incredibly fun.

1368
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:50,360
So, um...

1369
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,560
I've always been, like, curious and checking it out.

1370
00:58:54,260 --> 00:58:56,540
Because it's basically, like...

1371
00:58:57,060 --> 00:58:59,220
How do I explain it properly?

1372
00:59:01,340 --> 00:59:01,820
Um...

1373
00:59:01,820 --> 00:59:04,620
So, each round, you're in a different map, basically.

1374
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:06,700
And I've seen gameplay of it.

1375
00:59:06,780 --> 00:59:08,660
And then you get to choose your loadout.

1376
00:59:08,780 --> 00:59:12,240
And you get to upgrade your loadout the more rounds you go.

1377
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,620
You can play third person, but it's a choice.

1378
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:17,000
It's first...

1379
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,560
You can do first person or third person.

1380
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:20,220
But it's basically a choice between the two.

1381
00:59:35,050 --> 00:59:38,190
Yeah, so there is, like, their own rank-up system to it, too.

1382
00:59:38,970 --> 00:59:41,330
And you can get competitive points from it.

1383
00:59:42,530 --> 00:59:43,670
Oh, and there's a new hero!

1384
00:59:47,910 --> 00:59:49,170
Apparently, she's really strong.

1385
00:59:49,590 --> 00:59:52,390
I mean, all launch heroes are really strong when they first come out.

1386
00:59:52,930 --> 00:59:54,010
Before they get nerfed.

1387
00:59:54,690 --> 00:59:56,430
Because they want people to play the hero, you know?

1388
00:59:58,270 --> 01:00:00,090
But she looks fun to play.

1389
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:01,210
Which is nice.

1390
01:00:03,690 --> 01:00:05,750
I don't think she's available in rank yet.

1391
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:13,360
And there's the band system.

1392
01:00:13,740 --> 01:00:14,080
Alright, guys.

1393
01:00:14,140 --> 01:00:15,620
Remember, exclamation point Overwatch.

1394
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:16,580
And no more details.

1395
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:21,320
I actually was thinking about it.

1396
01:00:22,380 --> 01:00:25,120
I was thinking about going back into rank.

1397
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:26,860
Um, just...

1398
01:00:26,860 --> 01:00:27,700
Oh, there's Doki Watch!

1399
01:00:27,780 --> 01:00:28,260
That's me!

1400
01:00:29,540 --> 01:00:30,380
That's me!

1401
01:00:33,820 --> 01:00:35,700
Oh, is she in rank right now?

1402
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:36,240
Okay.

1403
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:38,260
Is she OP in rank?

1404
01:00:41,300 --> 01:00:41,780
Yay!

1405
01:00:44,900 --> 01:00:45,460
That's me.

1406
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:46,360
I'm all of them.

1407
01:00:53,530 --> 01:00:55,710
Oh, they get, like, their own transformations!

1408
01:00:56,570 --> 01:00:58,130
Oh, that is really maho shoujo.

1409
01:00:59,350 --> 01:01:00,230
Apparently, like...

1410
01:01:00,230 --> 01:01:00,910
Um...

1411
01:01:00,910 --> 01:01:02,870
All their skins have, like, unique...

1412
01:01:02,870 --> 01:01:03,190
Like, yeah.

1413
01:01:03,310 --> 01:01:04,590
Unique battle animations.

1414
01:01:05,070 --> 01:01:05,630
And stuff.

1415
01:01:06,170 --> 01:01:07,490
So, like, you know, like...

1416
01:01:07,490 --> 01:01:08,850
Juno with the hearts and everything.

1417
01:01:09,290 --> 01:01:10,270
And the flowers.

1418
01:01:10,530 --> 01:01:11,210
Oh, my God.

1419
01:01:11,430 --> 01:01:11,850
That...

1420
01:01:14,350 --> 01:01:15,970
Oh, you can have, like, do...

1421
01:01:15,970 --> 01:01:16,250
Different.

1422
01:01:17,510 --> 01:01:18,110
Jesus.

1423
01:01:19,670 --> 01:01:20,270
I...

1424
01:01:20,270 --> 01:01:20,510
I...

1425
01:01:22,330 --> 01:01:23,250
Get in.

1426
01:01:23,850 --> 01:01:25,210
Do you want...

1427
01:01:25,210 --> 01:01:26,830
Sorry, I shouldn't.

1428
01:01:30,410 --> 01:01:31,350
I can't.

1429
01:01:31,750 --> 01:01:32,090
I can't.

1430
01:01:32,390 --> 01:01:33,350
Doki, you can't say it.

1431
01:01:35,570 --> 01:01:37,390
By the way, you can give stuff now.

1432
01:01:37,390 --> 01:01:38,030
I believe.

1433
01:01:38,330 --> 01:01:38,450
Right?

1434
01:01:38,650 --> 01:01:39,190
You can...

1435
01:01:39,190 --> 01:01:41,050
You can give things now.

1436
01:01:45,030 --> 01:01:46,090
I'm sorry.

1437
01:01:48,110 --> 01:01:50,230
The Lone Rose gets plucked.

1438
01:01:51,250 --> 01:01:53,010
Oh, that's what I'm saying!

1439
01:01:53,270 --> 01:01:54,650
I love Abraxians.

1440
01:01:54,790 --> 01:01:55,730
They look so good.

1441
01:01:57,710 --> 01:01:59,050
2020 patch.

1442
01:01:59,630 --> 01:02:00,350
Mythic shop.

1443
01:02:01,990 --> 01:02:04,410
Oh, I didn't know about this.

1444
01:02:04,850 --> 01:02:06,610
Oh, I like this color scheme.

1445
01:02:11,890 --> 01:02:12,890
April 22nd.

1446
01:02:13,190 --> 01:02:13,290
Yeah!

1447
01:02:13,870 --> 01:02:15,030
That's when it all came out.

1448
01:02:15,650 --> 01:02:16,830
Oh, and then there's the Gundam collab.

1449
01:02:18,490 --> 01:02:18,990
Wow!

1450
01:02:20,050 --> 01:02:21,210
There it is.

1451
01:02:22,230 --> 01:02:24,210
Oh yeah, and then they have a little story too.

1452
01:02:24,550 --> 01:02:24,910
Hello!

1453
01:02:29,870 --> 01:02:30,370
Wait,

1454
01:02:35,510 --> 01:02:36,490
who's the evil one?

1455
01:02:37,950 --> 01:02:39,350
Oh, this is the story!

1456
01:02:46,310 --> 01:02:47,790
I miss Overwatch comics.

1457
01:02:48,430 --> 01:02:50,270
The Overwatch comics were like...

1458
01:02:50,270 --> 01:02:52,250
so interesting with the lore and stuff.

1459
01:02:52,390 --> 01:02:54,670
Remember when they first came out with the...

1460
01:02:54,670 --> 01:02:55,610
when they first like...

1461
01:02:55,610 --> 01:02:58,850
to hype up Overwatch, they had the little comics that they used to do.

1462
01:02:59,550 --> 01:03:00,850
And they build on the lore.

1463
01:03:00,850 --> 01:03:02,430
Someone to turn the tide...

1464
01:03:02,430 --> 01:03:02,730
Yeah.

1465
01:03:03,150 --> 01:03:04,330
Yeah, it's like a...

1466
01:03:04,330 --> 01:03:05,510
the Overwatch...

1467
01:03:05,510 --> 01:03:07,310
the Overwatch cinematics too.

1468
01:03:08,350 --> 01:03:08,410
Yeah, and the Overwatch cinematics too.

1469
01:03:08,410 --> 01:03:09,990
The enemy is closing in on her too.

1470
01:03:10,310 --> 01:03:11,270
She's in danger.

1471
01:03:11,690 --> 01:03:12,930
What are we waiting for?

1472
01:03:13,310 --> 01:03:14,070
Let's go!

1473
01:03:16,590 --> 01:03:18,690
I heard the stadium is like...

1474
01:03:18,690 --> 01:03:20,630
like everybody's playing the stadium now.

1475
01:03:21,410 --> 01:03:24,210
But I was thinking about coming back to rank just to...

1476
01:03:24,210 --> 01:03:26,350
check the new changes out with the purge system...

1477
01:03:26,350 --> 01:03:27,330
and see how far I could go.

1478
01:03:28,270 --> 01:03:28,670
Um...

1479
01:03:28,670 --> 01:03:29,670
but then I'm also like...

1480
01:03:29,670 --> 01:03:30,250
do I...

1481
01:03:30,250 --> 01:03:32,190
do I have enough in me?

1482
01:03:33,950 --> 01:03:34,910
To go...

1483
01:03:34,910 --> 01:03:36,770
to try and get top 500?

1484
01:03:37,010 --> 01:03:38,230
Do I have that in me?

1485
01:03:38,230 --> 01:03:39,710
to get through it?

1486
01:03:39,770 --> 01:03:39,990
Over time.

1487
01:03:40,750 --> 01:03:41,930
You're a lifesaver.

1488
01:03:42,450 --> 01:03:43,890
You looked quite stressed.

1489
01:03:44,090 --> 01:03:45,310
So I brought you a coffee.

1490
01:03:45,710 --> 01:03:46,670
Please cheer up, Edward.

1491
01:03:47,310 --> 01:03:48,010
Oh, Juno.

1492
01:03:48,210 --> 01:03:49,370
You're so thoughtful.

1493
01:03:49,850 --> 01:03:50,470
Thank you.

1494
01:03:51,870 --> 01:03:52,630
See, mother?

1495
01:03:53,070 --> 01:03:54,250
Five minutes was plenty.

1496
01:03:54,770 --> 01:03:55,050
Huh?

1497
01:03:55,970 --> 01:03:56,530
Mom!

1498
01:03:57,990 --> 01:03:58,550
Mother?

1499
01:03:58,830 --> 01:03:59,490
What's wrong?

1500
01:03:59,810 --> 01:04:00,370
Mother?

1501
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:01,650
Oh my god!

1502
01:04:02,490 --> 01:04:03,970
It's not like she's dead.

1503
01:04:04,230 --> 01:04:05,790
Wait, is that Evil D.Va?

1504
01:04:06,810 --> 01:04:08,150
Wait, is this D.Va?

1505
01:04:08,230 --> 01:04:11,750
When she wakes up, she'll be just like my new friends.

1506
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:13,610
Her heart will be hollow.

1507
01:04:13,870 --> 01:04:15,250
Oh, so like...

1508
01:04:15,250 --> 01:04:19,010
Doki Watch is like love, and D.Va is like hate.

1509
01:04:19,390 --> 01:04:20,350
What do you want from her?

1510
01:04:20,430 --> 01:04:21,530
If evil, why hot?

1511
01:04:23,850 --> 01:04:26,130
And I'm not here for that old fat.

1512
01:04:28,030 --> 01:04:29,210
I'm here for you.

1513
01:04:29,810 --> 01:04:30,110
Oh!

1514
01:04:31,210 --> 01:04:31,710
Pew pew!

1515
01:04:34,430 --> 01:04:35,630
Stay behind me, Juno.

1516
01:04:35,910 --> 01:04:36,950
Rally our hearts!

1517
01:04:36,950 --> 01:04:38,770
Rally our hearts!

1518
01:04:40,570 --> 01:04:42,170
Wait, is that Widow?

1519
01:04:44,150 --> 01:04:46,750
I would think Widow would be in the Nocturne.

1520
01:04:46,970 --> 01:04:48,390
I'm cleansing your mom of woe.

1521
01:04:48,770 --> 01:04:49,650
She's gonna be okay.

1522
01:04:49,870 --> 01:04:51,890
Don't worry, she'll have love in here again.

1523
01:04:52,650 --> 01:04:54,450
I promise we'll explain everything later.

1524
01:04:54,590 --> 01:04:55,510
Rally our hearts!

1525
01:04:55,510 --> 01:04:56,570
Get out of here first.

1526
01:04:57,370 --> 01:04:58,710
Kiriko, you ready?

1527
01:05:01,070 --> 01:05:03,430
Let my passionate heart guide you!

1528
01:05:05,560 --> 01:05:08,580
Oh, they recruited her like to the Doki Watch.

1529
01:05:09,020 --> 01:05:09,520
You need your power now!

1530
01:05:09,660 --> 01:05:11,080
They're like wake up!

1531
01:05:14,140 --> 01:05:14,780
I...

1532
01:05:14,780 --> 01:05:15,440
You do.

1533
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:16,940
You're one of us.

1534
01:05:17,060 --> 01:05:18,540
A hero of heart.

1535
01:05:18,540 --> 01:05:22,140
That magitek you're holding will unlock your true potential.

1536
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,480
All you have to do is...

1537
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:26,020
Just believe in the power of friendship!

1538
01:05:26,660 --> 01:05:28,020
And believe...

1539
01:05:28,020 --> 01:05:28,420
Truly.

1540
01:05:28,780 --> 01:05:30,480
The classic magical girl moment.

1541
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:34,680
I love how her little magical girl creatures are like little sharks.

1542
01:05:35,740 --> 01:05:36,280
Doki.

1543
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:36,660
See!

1544
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:37,480
Doki Doki!

1545
01:05:37,660 --> 01:05:39,100
That's where my name comes from!

1546
01:05:42,900 --> 01:05:43,660
It's me!

1547
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:45,600
Doki Doki.

1548
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:49,380
Oh my god.

1549
01:05:49,620 --> 01:05:50,480
Doki mention.

1550
01:05:51,380 --> 01:05:52,960
Oh no, there's like their little...

1551
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:55,060
Their little like companions.

1552
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:56,760
Don't make us do that.

1553
01:05:57,180 --> 01:05:59,020
We don't want to fight you anymore.

1554
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:00,960
Come home.

1555
01:06:01,260 --> 01:06:02,900
We can still fix this.

1556
01:06:04,860 --> 01:06:05,840
No break.

1557
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:07,200
It's too late.

1558
01:06:07,580 --> 01:06:08,160
Oh my gosh.

1559
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:09,020
She's Sindere.

1560
01:06:10,120 --> 01:06:10,720
Wait.

1561
01:06:10,820 --> 01:06:11,700
Who's that?

1562
01:06:12,380 --> 01:06:12,860
Wait.

1563
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:13,420
Who's that?

1564
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:14,960
Is that...

1565
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:15,440
Excuse me.

1566
01:06:16,100 --> 01:06:16,800
I hope now...

1567
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:19,320
Toxic Yuri.

1568
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:22,160
We are the heroes of heart.

1569
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:23,520
Protectors of the world.

1570
01:06:23,620 --> 01:06:24,480
Is he the...

1571
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:26,780
I've done my job, but you didn't do anything.

1572
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:27,320
Goodbye.

1573
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:29,580
I'm Kiriko.

1574
01:06:29,980 --> 01:06:30,720
Heart of passion.

1575
01:06:31,660 --> 01:06:32,700
I'm Brigitte.

1576
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,200
The heart of strength.

1577
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:35,920
Amelie.

1578
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:37,160
The heart of grace.

1579
01:06:37,460 --> 01:06:38,520
Amelie is...

1580
01:06:38,520 --> 01:06:38,940
Okay, yeah.

1581
01:06:39,040 --> 01:06:39,760
She is graceful.

1582
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:40,500
The heart of courage.

1583
01:06:42,220 --> 01:06:43,380
And you are Juno.

1584
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:45,060
The heart of hope.

1585
01:06:46,180 --> 01:06:48,140
Welcome to the heroes of heart.

1586
01:06:48,820 --> 01:06:49,120
Yay!

1587
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:52,320
What a magical adventure.

1588
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:53,200
Jokey watch.

1589
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:57,420
Would that mean there would be like a part two?

1590
01:07:00,180 --> 01:07:01,480
That's cute though.

1591
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:02,780
That's really cute.

1592
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:05,460
I wonder if that means there would be like a part two.

1593
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:08,460
Because who the heck was that guy that ran off with D.Va?

1594
01:07:09,140 --> 01:07:10,120
Is that...

1595
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:12,560
Is that their tuxedo mask?

1596
01:07:13,260 --> 01:07:14,420
I'm just wondering.

1597
01:07:14,860 --> 01:07:15,400
All right.

1598
01:07:15,820 --> 01:07:17,520
Wait, I want to see the skins actually.

1599
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:19,100
Oh yeah, guys.

1600
01:07:19,260 --> 01:07:20,720
Exclamation point overwatch.

1601
01:07:20,860 --> 01:07:21,200
By the way.

1602
01:07:21,340 --> 01:07:22,000
I need to pin that.

1603
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:24,140
Guys, because I want to do exclamation overwatch for me real quick.

1604
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:25,180
So I can pin the message.

1605
01:07:25,560 --> 01:07:26,120
Because the pin...

1606
01:07:26,120 --> 01:07:26,880
I didn't know how.

1607
01:07:27,100 --> 01:07:27,240
Why?

1608
01:07:27,340 --> 01:07:28,380
But pins expire.

1609
01:07:30,220 --> 01:07:30,720
But yes.

1610
01:07:30,860 --> 01:07:32,580
Exclamation point overwatch.

1611
01:07:32,900 --> 01:07:36,320
And if you click on the link, it really does help out a lot for me and the stream.

1612
01:07:36,580 --> 01:07:37,220
And the sponsor.

1613
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,900
So there's the mercy one.

1614
01:07:40,660 --> 01:07:41,740
Okay, not gonna lie.

1615
01:07:42,060 --> 01:07:44,580
The Romacho one is really, really cool.

1616
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:45,420
Wait.

1617
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:46,660
Not him.

1618
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:50,180
When he's like in the big form.

1619
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:52,720
Him.

1620
01:07:54,560 --> 01:07:55,600
Not him.

1621
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:56,360
Him.

1622
01:07:56,940 --> 01:07:58,660
I can take him.

1623
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:04,640
Oh, I can customize it.

1624
01:08:05,020 --> 01:08:06,380
Oh, because it goes away.

1625
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:07,640
Guys, I'm so dumb.

1626
01:08:08,360 --> 01:08:08,800
Manually.

1627
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:09,540
All right.

1628
01:08:09,660 --> 01:08:10,160
There we go.

1629
01:08:10,420 --> 01:08:11,380
I figured it out.

1630
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:13,040
Guys, you can tell I don't...

1631
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:14,000
I'm not on Twitch often.

1632
01:08:14,460 --> 01:08:14,860
I...

1633
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:19,160
But yeah.

1634
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:21,760
Obviously, he looks really cool in this form.

1635
01:08:21,900 --> 01:08:22,380
I really like...

1636
01:08:22,380 --> 01:08:22,520
Wait.

1637
01:08:22,580 --> 01:08:23,880
Where are the...

1638
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:25,000
Oh my god.

1639
01:08:25,060 --> 01:08:27,640
They actually used the Gundam sound effects.

1640
01:08:27,660 --> 01:08:28,700
That's actually cool.

1641
01:08:29,140 --> 01:08:31,840
The fact that they used the Gundam sound effects too.

1642
01:08:33,180 --> 01:08:34,640
Hey, what about like...

1643
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:37,480
Yeah, it's like...

1644
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:38,500
Some of the...

1645
01:08:38,500 --> 01:08:40,720
Some of the original sound effects from the anime.

1646
01:08:43,140 --> 01:08:44,320
Oh, okay.

1647
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:47,040
I like the highlight intros.

1648
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:48,360
Gotta go all out.

1649
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:49,220
I mean, it's a collaboration.

1650
01:08:49,220 --> 01:08:51,120
So it makes sense that they're going all out.

1651
01:08:51,700 --> 01:08:52,040
For it.

1652
01:08:52,700 --> 01:08:53,140
Oh!

1653
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:54,480
Okay.

1654
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:55,300
The glow.

1655
01:08:55,300 --> 01:08:56,700
The eye glow.

1656
01:08:57,380 --> 01:08:58,720
The eye glow.

1657
01:08:59,300 --> 01:09:00,800
And then you get the...

1658
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:02,600
Oh, the pose and everything.

1659
01:09:04,020 --> 01:09:06,000
Come to hell with me.

1660
01:09:06,140 --> 01:09:07,100
Oh, Reaper.

1661
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:11,260
Everyone who sees me will die.

1662
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:13,520
Whoa.

1663
01:09:14,180 --> 01:09:15,480
Come to hell with me.

1664
01:09:18,450 --> 01:09:19,910
I mean...

1665
01:09:21,610 --> 01:09:23,950
If you say so, Mr. Reaper.

1666
01:09:23,950 --> 01:09:24,590
I...

1667
01:09:28,430 --> 01:09:29,270
I...

1668
01:09:29,950 --> 01:09:30,490
Okay.

1669
01:09:30,970 --> 01:09:31,150
Okay.

1670
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:31,530
Sorry.

1671
01:09:31,970 --> 01:09:32,290
I...

1672
01:09:33,630 --> 01:09:34,050
Whoa!

1673
01:09:34,730 --> 01:09:35,950
You don't...

1674
01:09:38,350 --> 01:09:39,190
Whoa!

1675
01:09:40,030 --> 01:09:40,870
Whoa!

1676
01:09:41,170 --> 01:09:41,710
Okay.

1677
01:09:43,130 --> 01:09:43,970
What's the innocent?

1678
01:09:44,710 --> 01:09:46,170
You guys know.

1679
01:09:46,570 --> 01:09:46,810
Yeah.

1680
01:09:50,030 --> 01:09:51,550
Oh, that looks cool.

1681
01:09:51,550 --> 01:09:54,110
That looks really cool for the highlight intro.

1682
01:10:01,110 --> 01:10:01,610
Whoa.

1683
01:10:02,730 --> 01:10:03,730
Just twirling.

1684
01:10:04,630 --> 01:10:04,790
Whoa.

1685
01:10:05,870 --> 01:10:06,870
Just twirling.

1686
01:10:10,990 --> 01:10:11,930
I'm learning.

1687
01:10:12,170 --> 01:10:12,530
Oh, yeah.

1688
01:10:12,650 --> 01:10:14,010
I want to look at the Doki Watch, too.

1689
01:10:14,910 --> 01:10:15,270
Dream...

1690
01:10:15,270 --> 01:10:16,070
Oh, wait.

1691
01:10:16,330 --> 01:10:16,490
What?

1692
01:10:18,010 --> 01:10:18,850
Oh, wait.

1693
01:10:19,110 --> 01:10:19,590
Oh, wait.

1694
01:10:19,590 --> 01:10:20,830
That skin is so cute.

1695
01:10:21,790 --> 01:10:24,910
Guys, I've always wanted to have, like...

1696
01:10:24,910 --> 01:10:25,990
One of the...

1697
01:10:25,990 --> 01:10:26,490
The...

1698
01:10:27,630 --> 01:10:29,430
The Doki Cinematic Universe.

1699
01:10:29,810 --> 01:10:33,030
I've always wanted to have a version of me where I'm just a sheep.

1700
01:10:33,830 --> 01:10:34,950
Because it's just...

1701
01:10:34,950 --> 01:10:35,650
I don't know.

1702
01:10:35,770 --> 01:10:37,630
I think sheep designs are really cute.

1703
01:10:37,870 --> 01:10:38,590
In general.

1704
01:10:38,730 --> 01:10:40,450
I think it's just like the eyes and the horns.

1705
01:10:42,250 --> 01:10:43,330
So there's...

1706
01:10:43,330 --> 01:10:43,870
What is this?

1707
01:10:43,910 --> 01:10:44,450
There's glitter?

1708
01:10:44,970 --> 01:10:45,970
Wait, who's glitter?

1709
01:10:46,310 --> 01:10:46,630
What...

1710
01:10:46,630 --> 01:10:49,230
What is she in the Doki Watch lore?

1711
01:10:49,670 --> 01:10:51,750
Is she just, like, the bundle?

1712
01:10:52,050 --> 01:10:52,550
Or...

1713
01:10:52,550 --> 01:10:54,710
Does she have, like, actual lore?

1714
01:10:55,070 --> 01:10:56,090
About herself?

1715
01:10:58,690 --> 01:11:01,830
Who is she in the Doki Watch Cinematic Universe?

1716
01:11:02,190 --> 01:11:03,730
She's just a girl...

1717
01:11:03,730 --> 01:11:04,370
Oh, it's...

1718
01:11:04,370 --> 01:11:05,530
Oh, it's a recolor!

1719
01:11:06,150 --> 01:11:06,470
Oh!

1720
01:11:07,250 --> 01:11:08,290
Okay, I was, like, confused.

1721
01:11:08,370 --> 01:11:09,930
I was like, where was Mei in the story?

1722
01:11:10,370 --> 01:11:11,530
Oh, and there's...

1723
01:11:11,910 --> 01:11:13,210
Oh my god, look at her hair.

1724
01:11:13,970 --> 01:11:14,730
Wait, what is that?

1725
01:11:14,750 --> 01:11:17,110
Oh my god, there's, like, a little spider at the end.

1726
01:11:17,530 --> 01:11:18,470
Oh, that's cute.

1727
01:11:19,170 --> 01:11:20,330
It's, like, a little spider.

1728
01:11:20,390 --> 01:11:21,510
And there's Heart of Passion.

1729
01:11:22,310 --> 01:11:22,630
Wait.

1730
01:11:22,830 --> 01:11:23,830
Oh, I want to see her.

1731
01:11:24,350 --> 01:11:26,510
You can try them out, by the way, in the practice range.

1732
01:11:26,510 --> 01:11:28,730
I know I should be checking out Stadium, but...

1733
01:11:29,770 --> 01:11:30,410
I'm always...

1734
01:11:30,410 --> 01:11:32,810
I always, like, looking at the cosmetic medics and stuff.

1735
01:11:33,210 --> 01:11:33,890
I don't know what...

1736
01:11:33,890 --> 01:11:35,270
I aim to defeat.

1737
01:11:35,710 --> 01:11:36,050
What?

1738
01:11:36,350 --> 01:11:38,510
Is there anything different with, like, her stuff?

1739
01:11:39,930 --> 01:11:41,690
Because I know, like...

1740
01:11:41,690 --> 01:11:43,330
The Juno thing looks different.

1741
01:11:43,970 --> 01:11:46,330
Oh my god, it's been so long since I've been here.

1742
01:11:47,670 --> 01:11:48,410
Can I...

1743
01:11:48,410 --> 01:11:49,890
Let's see...

1744
01:11:51,090 --> 01:11:51,490
Ooh!

1745
01:11:53,050 --> 01:11:54,930
Alright, is there...

1746
01:11:54,930 --> 01:11:55,810
Anything different?

1747
01:11:57,010 --> 01:11:57,570
No?

1748
01:11:57,810 --> 01:11:58,370
Okay, wait.

1749
01:11:58,470 --> 01:12:00,250
Let me do the ultimate and stuff.

1750
01:12:00,970 --> 01:12:02,010
Oh, is it the Juno?

1751
01:12:02,010 --> 01:12:03,650
Oh, it's the Juno Mythic!

1752
01:12:03,810 --> 01:12:04,070
Oh!

1753
01:12:05,190 --> 01:12:07,310
I thought it was, um...

1754
01:12:07,810 --> 01:12:12,130
I thought, like, the skin itself from each of the Doki Watch as something different.

1755
01:12:12,490 --> 01:12:13,550
Oh, I see.

1756
01:12:13,810 --> 01:12:14,470
I see.

1757
01:12:15,310 --> 01:12:16,750
The Juno Mythic.

1758
01:12:17,950 --> 01:12:19,610
Oh, and then there's Evil Diva.

1759
01:12:20,890 --> 01:12:22,630
And then there's Kiriko.

1760
01:12:23,170 --> 01:12:25,270
Wait, does that mean I can look at the Mythics, too?

1761
01:12:25,630 --> 01:12:26,430
Does that mean I can...

1762
01:12:26,430 --> 01:12:27,470
Oh, there it is!

1763
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:31,920
Dome Chants.

1764
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:32,000
Dome Chants.

1765
01:12:32,160 --> 01:12:33,240
There's all the Mythic stuff.

1766
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:36,640
I was not here for a lot of the Mythic stuff, so...

1767
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:37,480
Um...

1768
01:12:37,480 --> 01:12:38,880
I know, like, some of them are like...

1769
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:40,100
Oh, there's the Iridescence!

1770
01:12:40,100 --> 01:12:41,440
The Mythic Aspects!

1771
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:43,000
Oh!

1772
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:46,580
Okay, these recolors look so good.

1773
01:12:46,680 --> 01:12:48,440
Like, are they for all the Mythic weapons, too?

1774
01:12:48,760 --> 01:12:49,680
Oh, I see!

1775
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:49,760
Let's see.

1776
01:12:51,380 --> 01:12:52,900
And then there's...

1777
01:12:53,540 --> 01:12:54,820
The gold version of her.

1778
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:58,080
Oh, so these are, like, all these stuff you can try out.

1779
01:12:58,140 --> 01:13:00,320
And, like, all the different combinations you can do.

1780
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:01,780
And everything.

1781
01:13:02,140 --> 01:13:04,940
Oh, and then you can do, like, her gold version.

1782
01:13:05,340 --> 01:13:07,380
When she joins the dark side.

1783
01:13:08,720 --> 01:13:10,800
And then the other colors that she has.

1784
01:13:10,860 --> 01:13:12,140
And then you can change the...

1785
01:13:12,140 --> 01:13:13,660
Her bow gets bigger, you know?

1786
01:13:13,820 --> 01:13:15,100
When she gets stronger.

1787
01:13:15,300 --> 01:13:16,820
She has different hairstyles.

1788
01:13:17,060 --> 01:13:17,940
And everything.

1789
01:13:17,940 --> 01:13:18,480
Wait.

1790
01:13:18,680 --> 01:13:18,800
Okay.

1791
01:13:18,820 --> 01:13:19,880
I wanna see her...

1792
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:21,780
I wanna see her...

1793
01:13:22,220 --> 01:13:22,620
Abilities.

1794
01:13:28,660 --> 01:13:29,060
Okay.

1795
01:13:29,240 --> 01:13:29,420
Yeah.

1796
01:13:31,660 --> 01:13:32,460
Okay, so...

1797
01:13:32,980 --> 01:13:34,420
Oh, it's, like, pink, too.

1798
01:13:34,700 --> 01:13:35,300
That's cute.

1799
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:37,600
Oh!

1800
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:38,760
It's a heart!

1801
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:39,680
Oh!

1802
01:13:40,540 --> 01:13:41,120
Oh, yeah.

1803
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:41,560
I forgot.

1804
01:13:41,700 --> 01:13:43,040
It's a little heart, too.

1805
01:13:43,960 --> 01:13:44,720
Oh, my God.

1806
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:46,240
When you shoot it, it, like...

1807
01:13:48,460 --> 01:13:50,440
Makes a little, like, a bubble sound effect.

1808
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:51,380
That's so cute.

1809
01:13:51,380 --> 01:13:52,840
That actually is really cute.

1810
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:52,860
That actually is really cute.

1811
01:13:55,160 --> 01:13:56,700
Makes you go doki doki!

1812
01:13:58,120 --> 01:13:59,380
What does it look like if I heal?

1813
01:13:59,480 --> 01:13:59,680
Whoop!

1814
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:00,140
I...

1815
01:14:00,140 --> 01:14:00,940
They died.

1816
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:03,060
Okay, where's my...

1817
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:05,120
My heal?

1818
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:06,100
Is my sense weird?

1819
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:08,420
Or am I just not used to aiming?

1820
01:14:10,020 --> 01:14:11,880
Okay, that should not be my sense.

1821
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:12,200
Stop!

1822
01:14:14,420 --> 01:14:15,080
Okay.

1823
01:14:15,660 --> 01:14:18,600
Guys, that definitely should not be my sense.

1824
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:20,140
I was like, wait a minute.

1825
01:14:20,460 --> 01:14:22,620
Guys, what's my sense, guys?

1826
01:14:23,650 --> 01:14:24,880
Guys, I was like...

1827
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:26,780
Oh, this feels weird.

1828
01:14:27,820 --> 01:14:28,320
Alright.

1829
01:14:29,180 --> 01:14:30,420
Oh, it is!

1830
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:31,300
Okay.

1831
01:14:31,820 --> 01:14:32,700
It is.

1832
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:33,300
Never mind.

1833
01:14:33,620 --> 01:14:36,060
I did not realize I played in that sense.

1834
01:14:36,300 --> 01:14:36,800
It's been a while.

1835
01:14:36,980 --> 01:14:37,240
Oh!

1836
01:14:37,340 --> 01:14:38,200
When I heal, it's...

1837
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:39,040
It's a...

1838
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:39,560
Circle!

1839
01:14:39,820 --> 01:14:40,360
It's a heart!

1840
01:14:40,740 --> 01:14:42,340
Okay, apparently that is my sense.

1841
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:43,580
I was not...

1842
01:14:43,580 --> 01:14:43,960
I...

1843
01:14:45,860 --> 01:14:47,240
Oh, when I do this!

1844
01:14:47,660 --> 01:14:48,600
It's a heart.

1845
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:49,860
Aw!

1846
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:51,380
Cause I'm sending them love!

1847
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:53,320
Threat neutralized.

1848
01:14:54,580 --> 01:14:55,080
Alright.

1849
01:14:55,740 --> 01:14:56,840
Feels so slow.

1850
01:14:57,180 --> 01:14:58,800
I'm gonna have to adjust my sense, cause it's been a while.

1851
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:00,100
Alright, what does this look like?

1852
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:12,540
In 2025, this is my ult.

1853
01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:14,920
This is...

1854
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:16,740
Oh my god.

1855
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:17,600
The love beam.

1856
01:15:18,380 --> 01:15:19,380
That's amazing.

1857
01:15:19,380 --> 01:15:21,500
That actually is amazing.

1858
01:15:21,820 --> 01:15:22,960
The power...

1859
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:23,980
The power of...

1860
01:15:23,980 --> 01:15:25,460
I shall win my...

1861
01:15:25,460 --> 01:15:27,160
Guys, this is my top 500 game.

1862
01:15:27,340 --> 01:15:27,940
Guys, please.

1863
01:15:28,100 --> 01:15:29,420
This is my top 500, guys.

1864
01:15:30,580 --> 01:15:30,920
Woo!

1865
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:35,400
Imagine getting top 500 with this.

1866
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:40,720
The power of love will punish you.

1867
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:43,620
Oh my god, coffee!

1868
01:15:43,740 --> 01:15:44,800
Thank you for the...

1869
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:45,520
For the raid!

1870
01:15:45,740 --> 01:15:46,440
Thank you, thank you!

1871
01:15:46,520 --> 01:15:47,280
Hello, everybody!

1872
01:15:47,480 --> 01:15:48,080
Hello, hello!

1873
01:15:48,580 --> 01:15:49,840
For those who are new here.

1874
01:15:50,100 --> 01:15:51,380
My name is Doki.

1875
01:15:51,780 --> 01:15:53,720
Today, I am sponsored by Overwatch.

1876
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:55,500
So I am checking out the...

1877
01:15:55,500 --> 01:15:57,280
I am checking out the new...

1878
01:15:57,280 --> 01:15:58,560
The newest updates they have.

1879
01:15:58,760 --> 01:16:00,280
So like, stadium and everything.

1880
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:04,460
It has been a very, very long time since I've been on Overwatch.

1881
01:16:05,340 --> 01:16:05,820
So...

1882
01:16:05,820 --> 01:16:07,740
So I'm just looking at all the new updates.

1883
01:16:07,740 --> 01:16:08,900
But thank you, everybody!

1884
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:10,200
For showing up!

1885
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:11,160
I'm usually on YouTube.

1886
01:16:11,560 --> 01:16:13,140
But today's a special Twitch day.

1887
01:16:13,380 --> 01:16:13,760
Uh...

1888
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:15,540
Because of my sponsor today!

1889
01:16:15,900 --> 01:16:16,240
So yes!

1890
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:17,120
Hello, everybody!

1891
01:16:17,300 --> 01:16:18,040
Welcome in!

1892
01:16:18,180 --> 01:16:18,880
Welcome, welcome!

1893
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:21,700
Alright, so that is the new Mythic Skins.

1894
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:22,660
Mythic Skins are always...

1895
01:16:22,660 --> 01:16:23,840
I think it's such a...

1896
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:25,420
Cool concept in Overwatch.

1897
01:16:26,760 --> 01:16:27,260
Um...

1898
01:16:27,260 --> 01:16:28,680
Especially for your favorite characters.

1899
01:16:28,680 --> 01:16:29,320
Cause I...

1900
01:16:29,320 --> 01:16:30,540
Remember like...

1901
01:16:30,540 --> 01:16:32,780
All of them have like...

1902
01:16:32,780 --> 01:16:35,140
Unique animations that you can do.

1903
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:36,460
I know like...

1904
01:16:36,460 --> 01:16:37,280
Okay, so...

1905
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:39,120
Especially when the high level you are.

1906
01:16:39,380 --> 01:16:41,260
Cause imagine the BM you can do with...

1907
01:16:41,260 --> 01:16:42,060
I love this one.

1908
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:43,640
When I saw that, I thought that was so funny.

1909
01:16:44,020 --> 01:16:44,340
I...

1910
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:50,660
The BM you can do on players.

1911
01:16:51,580 --> 01:16:52,720
That was the one...

1912
01:16:52,720 --> 01:16:54,820
When I saw this, when it came out, I was like...

1913
01:16:54,820 --> 01:16:56,120
Oh man, this is the one I actually...

1914
01:16:56,120 --> 01:16:57,480
This is the one I like the most.

1915
01:16:58,140 --> 01:16:58,680
Like...

1916
01:17:01,740 --> 01:17:03,560
But then obviously like...

1917
01:17:03,560 --> 01:17:06,320
The higher level your Mythic weapon is...

1918
01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:07,380
The crazier...

1919
01:17:07,380 --> 01:17:09,160
The death animations they are.

1920
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:09,780
And stuff.

1921
01:17:10,200 --> 01:17:10,960
So like...

1922
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:13,000
I think that one has always been like...

1923
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,380
The more unique stuff you can do.

1924
01:17:15,660 --> 01:17:16,820
With the weapons.

1925
01:17:17,160 --> 01:17:18,940
I know there's like skins and weapons.

1926
01:17:19,080 --> 01:17:20,080
But the weapons are funny.

1927
01:17:20,740 --> 01:17:21,380
I don't know like...

1928
01:17:21,380 --> 01:17:22,120
Which one was this?

1929
01:17:22,280 --> 01:17:22,900
There was...

1930
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:24,640
The Widow one.

1931
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:26,840
There's like...

1932
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:28,580
Oh yeah, you can do like...

1933
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:29,620
In spec animations.

1934
01:17:29,740 --> 01:17:30,540
Oh yeah, there's like...

1935
01:17:30,540 --> 01:17:31,940
Unique in spec animations too.

1936
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:35,280
Uh...

1937
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:38,000
Okay, let me double check something real quick guys.

1938
01:17:38,380 --> 01:17:39,020
To make sure...

1939
01:17:39,020 --> 01:17:39,360
Oh yeah!

1940
01:17:39,540 --> 01:17:39,860
I forgot!

1941
01:17:40,020 --> 01:17:41,100
I was forgot about Freya!

1942
01:17:41,820 --> 01:17:42,460
Sorry guys.

1943
01:17:42,780 --> 01:17:44,940
There's so much new stuff that I haven't like...

1944
01:17:45,340 --> 01:17:46,300
I have never...

1945
01:17:46,300 --> 01:17:47,560
I haven't been able to check out.

1946
01:17:47,740 --> 01:17:48,820
Because it has been a while.

1947
01:17:48,820 --> 01:17:50,940
So let me go look at Freya!

1948
01:17:51,260 --> 01:17:51,760
And see...

1949
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:54,600
How different she is compared to the other heroes.

1950
01:17:54,980 --> 01:17:55,740
Yeah, the new heroes!

1951
01:17:57,780 --> 01:17:58,420
Alright.

1952
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:00,020
What does Freya have?

1953
01:18:00,120 --> 01:18:00,640
Where is Freya?

1954
01:18:00,700 --> 01:18:01,280
She is...

1955
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:02,300
I believe a DPS.

1956
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:02,800
Ooh!

1957
01:18:03,200 --> 01:18:03,740
Alright.

1958
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:06,000
Details.

1959
01:18:06,760 --> 01:18:08,880
Rapidly fire automatic bolts.

1960
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:13,100
Slow your momentum to take aim with high speed explosive bolts.

1961
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:14,460
Using quick dashes.

1962
01:18:14,820 --> 01:18:15,120
Refreshes.

1963
01:18:15,540 --> 01:18:16,280
Take aim.

1964
01:18:17,080 --> 01:18:17,240
And...

1965
01:18:17,240 --> 01:18:18,100
Quick dash.

1966
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:19,120
Okay, so...

1967
01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:20,040
Ball and you're moving.

1968
01:18:20,240 --> 01:18:20,600
And refresh.

1969
01:18:20,860 --> 01:18:21,360
Take aim.

1970
01:18:21,820 --> 01:18:24,540
Launch upward with a gust of wind.

1971
01:18:25,220 --> 01:18:29,020
Every three final blows gain bonus ultimate charge.

1972
01:18:29,300 --> 01:18:29,820
Oh, okay.

1973
01:18:30,120 --> 01:18:30,580
So...

1974
01:18:30,580 --> 01:18:33,020
The more DPS you do, the more you'll have all...

1975
01:18:33,020 --> 01:18:34,580
Fire an explosive bullet.

1976
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:35,540
Hitting an enemy.

1977
01:18:36,220 --> 01:18:37,220
Wraps him up.

1978
01:18:38,920 --> 01:18:41,760
And pulls them in nearby enemies.

1979
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:44,660
Hitting an enemy wraps them up and pulls them.

1980
01:18:44,740 --> 01:18:46,600
Okay, so it's like a Zarya ult.

1981
01:18:47,560 --> 01:18:48,120
Basically.

1982
01:18:48,460 --> 01:18:51,280
It's four and then one take aim.

1983
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:52,360
Um, yeah.

1984
01:18:52,460 --> 01:18:54,580
I was gonna say, this is like a Zarya mini graph.

1985
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:58,560
Damaging an enemy temporarily reduces their healing received.

1986
01:18:58,760 --> 01:19:00,500
Oh, this is a very...

1987
01:19:00,500 --> 01:19:01,620
This is scary.

1988
01:19:01,780 --> 01:19:05,460
If a good player uses her, she seems really strong.

1989
01:19:05,460 --> 01:19:10,140
Especially with the damaging enemy temporarily reduces their healing received.

1990
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:11,880
So that's like anti-heal.

1991
01:19:12,380 --> 01:19:13,840
And then her other upgrades.

1992
01:19:14,040 --> 01:19:16,660
Enemy hits by three and quick are slowed by 20 seconds.

1993
01:19:17,060 --> 01:19:18,560
Real health enemies are revealed.

1994
01:19:18,660 --> 01:19:20,820
I feel like frost bolts are more important.

1995
01:19:21,200 --> 01:19:23,040
Frost bolts seem a lot of scary.

1996
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:24,460
All DPS do that.

1997
01:19:24,660 --> 01:19:27,380
But like, a lot of DPS don't really have like...

1998
01:19:27,980 --> 01:19:28,380
This.

1999
01:19:28,760 --> 01:19:29,880
Though, this is the thing.

2000
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:31,020
This is the most important part.

2001
01:19:31,320 --> 01:19:31,720
The...

2002
01:19:31,720 --> 01:19:34,440
Reducing your healing received is...

2003
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:34,620
Very...

2004
01:19:34,620 --> 01:19:37,120
Anti-heal is always like the scariest thing you can deal with.

2005
01:19:37,380 --> 01:19:39,100
Especially if they have freeze too.

2006
01:19:39,240 --> 01:19:40,400
Like slow as well.

2007
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:42,240
Um...

2008
01:19:42,240 --> 01:19:44,140
Oh, is it all passive for all DPS?

2009
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:45,700
Oh, it's all DPS now?

2010
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:46,540
Oh.

2011
01:19:47,540 --> 01:19:48,160
That's new.

2012
01:19:48,440 --> 01:19:49,000
I didn't realize.

2013
01:19:49,180 --> 01:19:50,660
This is for all damage heroes.

2014
01:19:50,940 --> 01:19:51,880
Oh my god.

2015
01:19:52,280 --> 01:19:52,400
Okay.

2016
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:53,140
That's...

2017
01:19:53,140 --> 01:19:53,640
Really scary.

2018
01:19:57,420 --> 01:19:58,000
That's...

2019
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,580
See, this has been a long time since I touched...

2020
01:20:00,580 --> 01:20:01,420
Oh, that's scary.

2021
01:20:01,940 --> 01:20:02,520
That's...

2022
01:20:02,520 --> 01:20:05,400
That and also Freya has...

2023
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:06,080
Uh...

2024
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:06,740
Frost...

2025
01:20:06,740 --> 01:20:07,800
Frost...

2026
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:08,780
This thing is always...

2027
01:20:09,740 --> 01:20:10,260
Uh...

2028
01:20:10,260 --> 01:20:10,820
Not great.

2029
01:20:15,620 --> 01:20:16,140
Alright.

2030
01:20:16,480 --> 01:20:17,780
Grants a temporary free use.

2031
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:18,380
A quick dash.

2032
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:19,280
Direct use.

2033
01:20:19,900 --> 01:20:20,860
Would take aim.

2034
01:20:21,020 --> 01:20:21,440
Refunds.

2035
01:20:21,500 --> 01:20:22,100
Four automatically.

2036
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:23,420
I don't know which one to get.

2037
01:20:24,760 --> 01:20:25,280
Alright.

2038
01:20:25,460 --> 01:20:25,660
So what?

2039
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:26,380
It's like...

2040
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:28,720
Okay.

2041
01:20:29,080 --> 01:20:29,840
I can't count.

2042
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:31,960
Alright.

2043
01:20:33,560 --> 01:20:34,080
Alright.

2044
01:20:34,160 --> 01:20:35,640
Let's make sure we have...

2045
01:20:35,640 --> 01:20:36,680
All our perks.

2046
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:38,220
Alright.

2047
01:20:40,420 --> 01:20:40,980
Alright.

2048
01:20:41,260 --> 01:20:41,760
And...

2049
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:42,420
How do I do perk?

2050
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:42,780
Okay.

2051
01:20:42,940 --> 01:20:43,300
Left alt.

2052
01:20:43,820 --> 01:20:44,700
It's left alt.

2053
01:20:45,220 --> 01:20:45,460
Alright.

2054
01:20:45,720 --> 01:20:46,180
Slow.

2055
01:20:46,640 --> 01:20:48,040
I would like my slow please.

2056
01:20:48,900 --> 01:20:49,460
And...

2057
01:20:49,460 --> 01:20:50,220
Which would be good?

2058
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:51,160
Ready to hunt?

2059
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:51,840
Or relentless?

2060
01:20:53,540 --> 01:20:54,380
Relentless barrage.

2061
01:20:54,580 --> 01:20:56,300
And that grants a temporary free use.

2062
01:20:56,380 --> 01:20:56,960
A quick dash.

2063
01:20:57,180 --> 01:20:58,040
Direct hit with...

2064
01:20:58,600 --> 01:20:59,260
Take aim.

2065
01:20:59,400 --> 01:20:59,780
Refunds.

2066
01:20:59,940 --> 01:21:00,540
Four automatically.

2067
01:21:00,780 --> 01:21:01,600
Is it barrage?

2068
01:21:01,700 --> 01:21:02,620
It's auto reload.

2069
01:21:02,940 --> 01:21:03,280
Oh!

2070
01:21:03,680 --> 01:21:04,240
Okay.

2071
01:21:06,260 --> 01:21:06,820
Okay.

2072
01:21:06,820 --> 01:21:07,540
So there's that.

2073
01:21:07,780 --> 01:21:08,460
And then there's the dash.

2074
01:21:08,640 --> 01:21:09,760
I have two dashes.

2075
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:12,380
Okay.

2076
01:21:12,540 --> 01:21:13,560
So it's two dashes.

2077
01:21:16,240 --> 01:21:16,620
Okay.

2078
01:21:17,460 --> 01:21:17,840
So...

2079
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:18,900
Twelve bullets.

2080
01:21:19,280 --> 01:21:19,420
Okay.

2081
01:21:20,260 --> 01:21:21,020
One, two, three, four.

2082
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:22,900
One, two, three, four.

2083
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:23,820
One,

2084
01:21:35,620 --> 01:21:36,160
two, three, four.

2085
01:21:36,160 --> 01:21:36,560
Okay.

2086
01:21:36,680 --> 01:21:37,640
If I can do...

2087
01:21:37,640 --> 01:21:37,760
Yeah.

2088
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:39,520
It feels like infinite ammo.

2089
01:21:40,520 --> 01:21:43,400
And then she has a lot of mobility too.

2090
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:45,740
Okay.

2091
01:21:47,320 --> 01:21:47,760
Oh.

2092
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:49,040
So I have to hook...

2093
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:49,280
Okay.

2094
01:21:49,320 --> 01:21:50,400
So I have to...

2095
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:52,480
I was trying to see if it works.

2096
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:52,920
If...

2097
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:53,140
What...

2098
01:21:53,140 --> 01:21:54,480
How it does when I don't hit it.

2099
01:21:54,660 --> 01:21:54,940
But...

2100
01:21:54,940 --> 01:21:56,720
I guess like the...

2101
01:21:57,520 --> 01:21:57,960
The...

2102
01:21:58,420 --> 01:22:00,840
When the mini graph happens if I hit the person.

2103
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:01,960
So...

2104
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:02,400
Yeah.

2105
01:22:02,540 --> 01:22:02,980
That's...

2106
01:22:02,980 --> 01:22:03,400
Scary.

2107
01:22:06,040 --> 01:22:06,600
Oh.

2108
01:22:06,700 --> 01:22:08,160
The E and then the...

2109
01:22:08,160 --> 01:22:08,520
Take aim.

2110
01:22:09,100 --> 01:22:09,380
Ooh.

2111
01:22:11,220 --> 01:22:11,860
All right.

2112
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:12,400
Let's see if...

2113
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:13,440
What happens when I hit him.

2114
01:22:14,820 --> 01:22:15,100
Okay.

2115
01:22:18,380 --> 01:22:18,940
Okay.

2116
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:19,480
So I...

2117
01:22:19,480 --> 01:22:21,520
That's a short range for the ult.

2118
01:22:21,860 --> 01:22:23,740
I'm getting very technical right now.

2119
01:22:25,160 --> 01:22:27,500
Like my overwatch brain is like...

2120
01:22:27,500 --> 01:22:29,300
Like cooking at the moment.

2121
01:22:31,260 --> 01:22:31,780
So...

2122
01:22:31,780 --> 01:22:32,380
Okay.

2123
01:22:32,700 --> 01:22:34,580
So the range is really small though.

2124
01:22:34,760 --> 01:22:35,280
For her ult.

2125
01:22:35,420 --> 01:22:35,520
Yeah.

2126
01:22:35,660 --> 01:22:36,260
It's a...

2127
01:22:36,260 --> 01:22:37,880
It's a baby grab.

2128
01:22:39,260 --> 01:22:40,960
She seems fun to play though.

2129
01:22:42,180 --> 01:22:43,920
She seems really fun to play.

2130
01:22:44,100 --> 01:22:44,600
In general.

2131
01:22:45,260 --> 01:22:45,420
Yeah.

2132
01:22:45,640 --> 01:22:45,860
Fair enough.

2133
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:47,200
Short but lots of mobility.

2134
01:22:47,460 --> 01:22:47,600
Yeah.

2135
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:50,840
The...

2136
01:22:51,660 --> 01:22:54,540
The infinite ammo is like...

2137
01:22:54,540 --> 01:22:57,280
Really strong if we get builded up to there.

2138
01:22:57,540 --> 01:22:58,540
I heard in stadium.

2139
01:22:58,560 --> 01:23:02,660
You can basically build a mercy player that never dies.

2140
01:23:02,660 --> 01:23:03,080
Is blue.

2141
01:23:06,060 --> 01:23:07,100
Because like...

2142
01:23:07,100 --> 01:23:08,800
You know how I said you build traits and stuff?

2143
01:23:09,200 --> 01:23:09,720
So...

2144
01:23:09,720 --> 01:23:10,140
It's like...

2145
01:23:10,140 --> 01:23:10,900
It's like a MOBA.

2146
01:23:11,380 --> 01:23:11,900
So...

2147
01:23:11,900 --> 01:23:12,180
In...

2148
01:23:12,180 --> 01:23:13,600
It's like a MOBA where you...

2149
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:14,000
Like...

2150
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,840
You build traits and stuff to upgrade yourself.

2151
01:23:17,160 --> 01:23:17,620
Each...

2152
01:23:17,620 --> 01:23:17,860
Like...

2153
01:23:17,860 --> 01:23:19,160
While the round is going on.

2154
01:23:19,340 --> 01:23:22,680
And then there's like moments where you can build a mercy player that...

2155
01:23:23,360 --> 01:23:23,880
Um...

2156
01:23:23,880 --> 01:23:24,980
That can never die.

2157
01:23:25,160 --> 01:23:25,980
Especially when she...

2158
01:23:25,980 --> 01:23:27,060
She can res and stuff.

2159
01:23:27,220 --> 01:23:28,140
And take like...

2160
01:23:28,140 --> 01:23:29,160
10 million damage.

2161
01:23:29,480 --> 01:23:29,740
Yeah.

2162
01:23:29,820 --> 01:23:32,100
Some stadium builds go absolutely crazy.

2163
01:23:32,100 --> 01:23:33,720
And you can build like...

2164
01:23:33,720 --> 01:23:34,100
An actual...

2165
01:23:34,840 --> 01:23:35,420
Raid boss.

2166
01:23:35,700 --> 01:23:36,060
Uh...

2167
01:23:36,060 --> 01:23:36,820
For supports.

2168
01:23:37,160 --> 01:23:38,380
Here from stadiums.

2169
01:23:38,460 --> 01:23:39,380
From what I've heard.

2170
01:23:39,900 --> 01:23:41,580
I have not reloaded.

2171
01:23:44,120 --> 01:23:45,000
Oh, there you go.

2172
01:23:45,100 --> 01:23:45,480
There's those.

2173
01:23:45,660 --> 01:23:46,020
There you go.

2174
01:23:46,080 --> 01:23:47,040
I messed up my...

2175
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:48,500
I messed up my perk.

2176
01:23:48,680 --> 01:23:49,940
And now I've reloaded.

2177
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:50,840
That was the...

2178
01:23:50,840 --> 01:23:52,800
I felt like that was the first reload I did.

2179
01:23:53,140 --> 01:23:53,940
Just now.

2180
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:55,600
Healers never die.

2181
01:23:56,100 --> 01:23:56,360
Woo!

2182
01:23:59,160 --> 01:24:00,440
That sounds really scary.

2183
01:24:00,440 --> 01:24:02,820
Because if I can do that as a support for...

2184
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:03,700
Stadium.

2185
01:24:03,740 --> 01:24:06,060
It makes me wonder what kind of builds you can do.

2186
01:24:06,340 --> 01:24:07,520
As a...

2187
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:09,460
As like DPS and tank.

2188
01:24:09,700 --> 01:24:10,000
Does that...

2189
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:10,920
How tanky...

2190
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:11,560
It's like...

2191
01:24:11,560 --> 01:24:12,840
How tanky is a...

2192
01:24:12,840 --> 01:24:13,620
Can a tank be?

2193
01:24:13,700 --> 01:24:14,800
If you can build like...

2194
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:17,340
An almost invincible support player.

2195
01:24:18,980 --> 01:24:19,500
Like...

2196
01:24:20,380 --> 01:24:20,900
Like...

2197
01:24:20,900 --> 01:24:23,060
How far can the HP go?

2198
01:24:27,260 --> 01:24:27,840
Yay!

2199
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:28,580
I...

2200
01:24:28,580 --> 01:24:29,500
I enjoy...

2201
01:24:29,500 --> 01:24:30,840
I enjoy the gunplay...

2202
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:31,500
Of Freya.

2203
01:24:32,240 --> 01:24:32,820
Actually...

2204
01:24:32,820 --> 01:24:34,180
Really wanna try Freya in quick play.

2205
01:24:34,760 --> 01:24:36,340
I really enjoy her...

2206
01:24:36,340 --> 01:24:36,920
Gunplay.

2207
01:24:39,940 --> 01:24:40,620
Let's see.

2208
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:42,900
Makes me feel like I'm a good player.

2209
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:45,540
That's...

2210
01:24:45,540 --> 01:24:47,320
Guys, I miss hitscan.

2211
01:24:47,660 --> 01:24:48,060
You know...

2212
01:24:48,060 --> 01:24:49,460
I love hitscan.

2213
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:50,720
It actually...

2214
01:24:50,720 --> 01:24:52,800
It actually makes me feel like I'm a good player.

2215
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:53,860
Playing Freya.

2216
01:24:54,440 --> 01:24:54,960
But...

2217
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:55,240
To be fair.

2218
01:24:55,360 --> 01:24:56,460
I am on a...

2219
01:24:56,460 --> 01:24:58,040
I am on a...

2220
01:24:58,040 --> 01:24:58,960
Practice range.

2221
01:24:59,240 --> 01:24:59,600
So...

2222
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:01,280
Let's see how I feel in quick play.

2223
01:25:01,720 --> 01:25:02,080
Haha!

2224
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:03,760
Will I feel the same way?

2225
01:25:04,260 --> 01:25:04,780
Will I...

2226
01:25:06,360 --> 01:25:07,260
Will I...

2227
01:25:07,580 --> 01:25:09,820
Will I feel the same way in quick play?

2228
01:25:09,900 --> 01:25:11,560
If I try to play her?

2229
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:12,400
I...

2230
01:25:16,540 --> 01:25:18,040
Is she not hitscan?

2231
01:25:18,040 --> 01:25:19,560
She feels like hitscan.

2232
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:20,940
Her bullets feel...

2233
01:25:20,940 --> 01:25:21,480
Feel...

2234
01:25:21,480 --> 01:25:22,500
Really fast.

2235
01:25:23,960 --> 01:25:24,740
Is she...

2236
01:25:24,740 --> 01:25:25,780
Is she projectile?

2237
01:25:26,120 --> 01:25:28,880
Her bullets feel like as fast as a hitscan.

2238
01:25:30,260 --> 01:25:31,620
Or is there like...

2239
01:25:31,620 --> 01:25:33,020
She's a fast projectile.

2240
01:25:33,140 --> 01:25:33,260
Oh!

2241
01:25:33,400 --> 01:25:34,600
She's a fast projectile.

2242
01:25:34,740 --> 01:25:34,960
Okay.

2243
01:25:37,280 --> 01:25:39,180
Just really fast projectiles.

2244
01:25:39,300 --> 01:25:39,440
Alright!

2245
01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:40,460
Let's see how I feel.

2246
01:25:40,820 --> 01:25:41,780
It's been a while.

2247
01:25:42,020 --> 01:25:43,360
I'm also a little sick too.

2248
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:48,440
An aim down slight...

2249
01:25:48,440 --> 01:25:48,940
Single ball...

2250
01:25:48,940 --> 01:25:49,080
Okay!

2251
01:25:49,220 --> 01:25:50,760
So her aim down is slower.

2252
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:54,400
It's fast at least.

2253
01:25:54,720 --> 01:25:55,540
Yeah, her...

2254
01:25:55,540 --> 01:25:58,120
I thought it was hitscan because it felt really, really fast.

2255
01:26:00,120 --> 01:26:01,380
So we'll see how it goes.

2256
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:05,800
Where are skins any...

2257
01:26:05,800 --> 01:26:06,560
Oh, I don't have any.

2258
01:26:06,860 --> 01:26:07,200
Haha!

2259
01:26:07,580 --> 01:26:08,840
I was like, let's see their skins!

2260
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:10,860
And I was like, oh wait, I don't have any of the skins.

2261
01:26:11,260 --> 01:26:11,560
I...

2262
01:26:12,220 --> 01:26:13,440
She just came out.

2263
01:26:18,150 --> 01:26:18,510
Alright.

2264
01:26:20,830 --> 01:26:21,410
Alright.

2265
01:26:21,590 --> 01:26:22,010
And if...

2266
01:26:22,010 --> 01:26:23,990
If I can't play her...

2267
01:26:23,990 --> 01:26:25,190
Oh, I hate defense.

2268
01:26:25,550 --> 01:26:25,930
Oh!

2269
01:26:27,070 --> 01:26:27,650
Why?

2270
01:26:28,570 --> 01:26:29,150
No!

2271
01:26:29,810 --> 01:26:30,770
They took...

2272
01:26:30,770 --> 01:26:31,650
My legs!

2273
01:26:32,250 --> 01:26:34,230
I was gonna say my backup was legs.

2274
01:26:36,870 --> 01:26:39,270
Backup was gonna be legs if I can't do...

2275
01:26:39,270 --> 01:26:40,570
If I can't play Freya.

2276
01:26:43,070 --> 01:26:45,330
Alright, I guess I have to climb up.

2277
01:26:45,330 --> 01:26:47,290
Oh my god, it's been so long.

2278
01:26:48,590 --> 01:26:49,970
It's been so long!

2279
01:26:50,850 --> 01:26:52,150
Let's see how this goes.

2280
01:26:53,370 --> 01:26:55,230
I feel like a baby right now.

2281
01:26:55,610 --> 01:26:55,910
Haha!

2282
01:26:57,210 --> 01:27:00,290
Oh, I feel like a little baby trying to play...

2283
01:27:00,290 --> 01:27:01,510
Play Overwatch again.

2284
01:27:03,770 --> 01:27:06,070
Sojourn is just Freya with less steps.

2285
01:27:06,350 --> 01:27:07,470
Bro, I'm bad at Sojourn.

2286
01:27:08,050 --> 01:27:09,170
That's not good for me.

2287
01:27:09,170 --> 01:27:10,370
Oh wait, someone already has...

2288
01:27:18,210 --> 01:27:20,110
Wait, someone already has the mythic skin.

2289
01:27:20,870 --> 01:27:21,650
It's crazy.

2290
01:27:24,010 --> 01:27:24,830
Guys, please.

2291
01:27:25,450 --> 01:27:26,790
Please, let me see you.

2292
01:27:26,930 --> 01:27:27,610
Oh, it is slow.

2293
01:27:27,710 --> 01:27:28,450
I see the slow.

2294
01:27:28,670 --> 01:27:30,230
I see the slowness now.

2295
01:27:30,390 --> 01:27:31,470
Where's my I need healing?

2296
01:27:33,030 --> 01:27:34,270
This is very important.

2297
01:27:35,210 --> 01:27:35,470
Yeah.

2298
01:27:36,030 --> 01:27:36,970
Right click is slow.

2299
01:27:36,970 --> 01:27:37,970
There we go.

2300
01:27:40,210 --> 01:27:40,850
That's fine.

2301
01:27:42,210 --> 01:27:42,690
That's fine.

2302
01:27:44,130 --> 01:27:44,530
Woo!

2303
01:27:46,810 --> 01:27:47,210
Yep.

2304
01:27:47,530 --> 01:27:48,410
Alright, now I see it.

2305
01:27:51,950 --> 01:27:52,650
Where is he?

2306
01:27:54,950 --> 01:27:57,550
For some reason, I feel like I could hover, but I can't.

2307
01:27:59,670 --> 01:28:00,470
Click, click, click.

2308
01:28:01,150 --> 01:28:01,850
I like this.

2309
01:28:02,210 --> 01:28:02,950
Click, click, click.

2310
01:28:04,190 --> 01:28:04,930
Oh fuck!

2311
01:28:05,110 --> 01:28:05,870
Oh shit!

2312
01:28:08,170 --> 01:28:10,330
I don't know why I expected to get heals.

2313
01:28:13,570 --> 01:28:14,050
Alright.

2314
01:28:14,710 --> 01:28:14,990
Whoops.

2315
01:28:15,550 --> 01:28:18,730
The sound is very satisfying though, when I go like...

2316
01:28:18,730 --> 01:28:19,490
Pew pew pew pew pew.

2317
01:28:19,710 --> 01:28:22,530
Okay legs, why are you not doing damage?

2318
01:28:22,690 --> 01:28:24,810
How am I getting more ult charge than you?

2319
01:28:26,590 --> 01:28:28,110
What are you doing legs?

2320
01:28:28,350 --> 01:28:29,310
Do your job!

2321
01:28:30,070 --> 01:28:31,150
Oh my god.

2322
01:28:31,150 --> 01:28:31,510
I know.

2323
01:28:33,530 --> 01:28:34,490
Okay, never mind.

2324
01:28:34,570 --> 01:28:35,410
He's catching up now.

2325
01:28:35,950 --> 01:28:36,770
He's catching up.

2326
01:28:38,570 --> 01:28:40,830
Oh, she's weak to hit scan focus.

2327
01:28:41,030 --> 01:28:41,670
That's good to know.

2328
01:28:43,010 --> 01:28:45,050
Bro, it is peaceful.

2329
01:28:46,210 --> 01:28:47,210
Guys, don't worry.

2330
01:28:48,030 --> 01:28:50,090
I keep thinking I can float down.

2331
01:28:50,290 --> 01:28:50,870
I don't know why.

2332
01:28:51,130 --> 01:28:53,270
There's something in there that makes me think I can...

2333
01:28:53,270 --> 01:28:56,150
Please, there's so many things going on.

2334
01:28:56,150 --> 01:28:56,330
Why?

2335
01:28:59,350 --> 01:29:00,590
Oh my god, you're right.

2336
01:29:00,890 --> 01:29:01,490
No, it's fine.

2337
01:29:02,410 --> 01:29:03,350
I just need warm up.

2338
01:29:06,290 --> 01:29:07,370
Can't believe it.

2339
01:29:08,070 --> 01:29:10,410
Guys, like I said...

2340
01:29:10,410 --> 01:29:11,630
No, never mind.

2341
01:29:11,750 --> 01:29:14,170
I was gonna say I was gonna play someone else, but...

2342
01:29:14,170 --> 01:29:16,210
I keep thinking I can float down.

2343
01:29:16,710 --> 01:29:18,270
And that's like messing me up.

2344
01:29:18,270 --> 01:29:18,290
What?

2345
01:29:21,390 --> 01:29:22,750
Oh my god, he's won!

2346
01:29:23,710 --> 01:29:24,650
Wait, how did this do it?

2347
01:29:25,930 --> 01:29:26,670
It was fine.

2348
01:29:29,030 --> 01:29:31,710
Oh, DPS makes me have to focus so much!

2349
01:29:34,650 --> 01:29:35,010
Oh!

2350
01:29:38,590 --> 01:29:40,750
I don't know why, but...

2351
01:29:43,470 --> 01:29:44,250
Oh, okay.

2352
01:29:44,330 --> 01:29:44,810
What was it?

2353
01:29:44,810 --> 01:29:46,130
Frost, yeah.

2354
01:29:47,930 --> 01:29:51,150
Guys, I forgot how much I have to focus when I play DPS.

2355
01:29:55,780 --> 01:29:56,420
Oh!

2356
01:29:57,740 --> 01:29:59,120
I need to actually think!

2357
01:30:01,380 --> 01:30:02,680
Please, he's won!

2358
01:30:03,080 --> 01:30:03,540
No!

2359
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:05,840
He looked at me!

2360
01:30:07,580 --> 01:30:09,740
The hitscat looked at me!

2361
01:30:11,040 --> 01:30:13,460
Please, soldier, use your ult!

2362
01:30:14,360 --> 01:30:19,240
Oh my god, it's not that difficult to ult!

2363
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:20,600
You're a soldier!

2364
01:30:25,060 --> 01:30:29,400
Please, I almost built another ult while waiting for you!

2365
01:30:35,220 --> 01:30:37,320
I'm trying to figure out the speed!

2366
01:30:42,110 --> 01:30:43,070
Jesus Christ.

2367
01:30:43,510 --> 01:30:44,190
Okay.

2368
01:30:48,430 --> 01:30:50,610
Oh my god, it's fine, I killed one.

2369
01:30:51,030 --> 01:30:51,370
I...

2370
01:30:57,110 --> 01:31:00,270
I'm just saying, our soldier should at least ult.

2371
01:31:01,850 --> 01:31:02,390
I...

2372
01:31:02,390 --> 01:31:03,090
Worth it.

2373
01:31:03,510 --> 01:31:04,330
He's waiting.

2374
01:31:04,550 --> 01:31:06,990
When will it ever be the right moment?

2375
01:31:07,110 --> 01:31:09,110
Oh my god, he's right here, I can hear him.

2376
01:31:09,770 --> 01:31:12,670
When will it ever be the right moment for you?

2377
01:31:14,010 --> 01:31:14,550
Please!

2378
01:31:15,050 --> 01:31:16,270
Oh my god, you're welcome!

2379
01:31:16,270 --> 01:31:16,430
You're welcome!

2380
01:31:19,770 --> 01:31:20,270
Okay.

2381
01:31:20,570 --> 01:31:21,150
That's fine.

2382
01:31:24,110 --> 01:31:24,790
That's fine.

2383
01:31:25,350 --> 01:31:26,410
This is not fine.

2384
01:31:26,550 --> 01:31:27,290
That's not fine!

2385
01:31:28,870 --> 01:31:29,930
Soldier, please!

2386
01:31:30,190 --> 01:31:31,250
That was your ult!

2387
01:31:31,850 --> 01:31:32,970
I have to!

2388
01:31:33,470 --> 01:31:35,690
Bro, none of my team has perks for me!

2389
01:31:36,530 --> 01:31:37,030
I...

2390
01:31:38,690 --> 01:31:39,450
Okay, look.

2391
01:31:39,530 --> 01:31:41,110
All I'm saying is, I'm not the problem.

2392
01:31:41,110 --> 01:31:41,990
I'm...

2393
01:31:41,990 --> 01:31:43,750
I'm not the problem.

2394
01:31:44,090 --> 01:31:44,530
I'm...

2395
01:31:44,770 --> 01:31:46,490
I know I'm not the problem.

2396
01:31:51,510 --> 01:31:53,550
I need to use this for healers.

2397
01:31:53,990 --> 01:31:55,350
Oh my god, please.

2398
01:31:55,490 --> 01:31:57,030
I can't go on point, guys.

2399
01:32:00,010 --> 01:32:01,210
I'm not the problem.

2400
01:32:02,470 --> 01:32:04,170
I'm not the problem, guys.

2401
01:32:12,140 --> 01:32:13,080
Okay.

2402
01:32:13,680 --> 01:32:14,200
Not me!

2403
01:32:14,520 --> 01:32:15,760
I'm doing my job!

2404
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:19,360
I'm not...

2405
01:32:19,360 --> 01:32:20,980
I don't know.

2406
01:32:22,670 --> 01:32:23,980
All I'm saying...

2407
01:32:23,980 --> 01:32:24,520
Not me.

2408
01:32:29,760 --> 01:32:30,700
Alright.

2409
01:32:31,400 --> 01:32:32,200
I'm mad.

2410
01:32:34,460 --> 01:32:35,400
I'm...

2411
01:32:35,400 --> 01:32:36,800
I'm mad.

2412
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:42,460
Let me play a different DPS character that I'm very familiar with to...

2413
01:32:42,460 --> 01:32:43,480
Be less mad.

2414
01:32:43,780 --> 01:32:45,300
And then I'll go back to Freya.

2415
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:45,920
Alright.

2416
01:32:52,640 --> 01:32:53,620
Don't worry.

2417
01:32:56,040 --> 01:32:57,080
And then...

2418
01:32:57,080 --> 01:32:58,340
The moment...

2419
01:32:58,340 --> 01:32:59,240
The moment...

2420
01:32:59,240 --> 01:33:02,280
I play the other character, I'll go back to Freya.

2421
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:02,920
Alright.

2422
01:33:05,200 --> 01:33:06,160
Oh, man.

2423
01:33:06,760 --> 01:33:12,860
All I'm saying is our soldier waited so long to make the perfect play...

2424
01:33:13,480 --> 01:33:14,820
On his ultimate.

2425
01:33:15,500 --> 01:33:16,070
And he still...

2426
01:33:16,460 --> 01:33:17,300
He did it all.

2427
01:33:17,660 --> 01:33:20,680
And I was like, soldier, what were you waiting on?

2428
01:33:20,780 --> 01:33:21,200
Okay, guys.

2429
01:33:21,300 --> 01:33:22,440
Who is the meta DPS?

2430
01:33:22,700 --> 01:33:23,680
Am I not player?

2431
01:33:24,060 --> 01:33:24,640
Because...

2432
01:33:25,720 --> 01:33:26,300
Alright.

2433
01:33:30,100 --> 01:33:31,140
I'll play soldier.

2434
01:33:31,380 --> 01:33:33,500
Actually, let me just play legs real quick.

2435
01:33:35,220 --> 01:33:36,600
I have a lot of...

2436
01:33:37,560 --> 01:33:38,040
Actually...

2437
01:33:38,620 --> 01:33:40,860
I think Strike Commander is my favorite skin.

2438
01:33:42,060 --> 01:33:42,680
Freya is meta.

2439
01:33:44,020 --> 01:33:44,800
Freya is meta.

2440
01:33:45,060 --> 01:33:45,840
I'm not surprised.

2441
01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:47,680
She builds her ult really, really fast.

2442
01:33:50,800 --> 01:33:51,280
Soldier...

2443
01:33:51,280 --> 01:33:52,680
I mean, soldier is always really strong.

2444
01:33:52,780 --> 01:33:53,220
You can aim.

2445
01:33:56,940 --> 01:33:57,420
Okay.

2446
01:33:57,680 --> 01:33:58,980
What is meta in high elo?

2447
01:34:02,420 --> 01:34:04,380
You guys don't have to tell me...

2448
01:34:04,380 --> 01:34:04,760
I...

2449
01:34:04,760 --> 01:34:07,480
Because there's a difference between meta and...

2450
01:34:07,480 --> 01:34:07,600
And...

2451
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:10,260
In low elo and meta in high elo.

2452
01:34:12,760 --> 01:34:14,020
What is...

2453
01:34:14,020 --> 01:34:15,720
What is strong in high elo?

2454
01:34:16,360 --> 01:34:17,500
It's so dirty.

2455
01:34:21,180 --> 01:34:21,860
Okay.

2456
01:34:22,320 --> 01:34:24,620
You ass like I play rank.

2457
01:34:25,540 --> 01:34:26,220
Soldier.

2458
01:34:27,440 --> 01:34:27,840
There's...

2459
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:28,260
No way.

2460
01:34:28,420 --> 01:34:29,120
Is Torva actually?

2461
01:34:30,900 --> 01:34:31,300
Okay.

2462
01:34:32,220 --> 01:34:32,540
Alright.

2463
01:34:33,480 --> 01:34:34,880
It's been a while since I've...

2464
01:34:34,880 --> 01:34:36,340
I don't know what perks were soldier though.

2465
01:34:36,440 --> 01:34:37,780
I should have looked at the perks for soldier.

2466
01:34:41,480 --> 01:34:42,160
Oh my god.

2467
01:34:42,260 --> 01:34:43,060
Of course, Ashe.

2468
01:34:47,540 --> 01:34:48,300
Click, click, click.

2469
01:34:49,740 --> 01:34:52,280
I forgot what it was like to aim in Overwatch though.

2470
01:34:52,940 --> 01:34:54,060
It's been so long.

2471
01:34:54,060 --> 01:34:54,280
Wait.

2472
01:34:54,400 --> 01:34:55,840
They're just walking to point.

2473
01:34:56,120 --> 01:34:56,560
Hahaha.

2474
01:34:59,240 --> 01:34:59,500
Wait.

2475
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:00,220
Where did they go?

2476
01:35:00,680 --> 01:35:02,120
Just gonna let them walk on point?

2477
01:35:02,440 --> 01:35:03,580
Where did my tank go?

2478
01:35:07,660 --> 01:35:09,400
You just gonna let them walk up?

2479
01:35:09,640 --> 01:35:10,000
Tank!

2480
01:35:10,140 --> 01:35:11,220
Get back on high ground!

2481
01:35:11,460 --> 01:35:12,160
What you doing?

2482
01:35:16,840 --> 01:35:17,580
Oh my god.

2483
01:35:17,640 --> 01:35:19,620
He just dropped down and never came back up.

2484
01:35:23,390 --> 01:35:24,390
He's a farmer.

2485
01:35:25,130 --> 01:35:25,870
Oh no!

2486
01:35:26,010 --> 01:35:27,090
He right clicked me!

2487
01:35:28,690 --> 01:35:29,490
My bad.

2488
01:35:30,550 --> 01:35:31,810
I forgot to...

2489
01:35:31,810 --> 01:35:32,850
I ego peeked him.

2490
01:35:33,010 --> 01:35:35,110
I was like, there's no way he hits that right click.

2491
01:35:35,870 --> 01:35:38,410
The high ground is for cowards!

2492
01:35:40,230 --> 01:35:43,050
Like, all I'm saying is if he was...

2493
01:35:43,050 --> 01:35:47,010
If he was there on high ground with me, I'd get my own personal shield.

2494
01:35:48,050 --> 01:35:49,150
But I didn't.

2495
01:35:49,930 --> 01:35:52,530
I didn't, so I have to peek like a pussy.

2496
01:35:53,070 --> 01:35:54,530
Sorry, like a...

2497
01:35:54,930 --> 01:35:56,250
Like a scared little girl.

2498
01:35:59,050 --> 01:36:00,090
I have to remember.

2499
01:36:01,030 --> 01:36:02,950
I can not be as toxic.

2500
01:36:06,690 --> 01:36:07,130
Alright.

2501
01:36:07,830 --> 01:36:09,590
Aiming in this game is so different.

2502
01:36:10,090 --> 01:36:11,270
Like, as a DPS.

2503
01:36:14,010 --> 01:36:15,250
I'm not used to it.

2504
01:36:15,370 --> 01:36:16,210
Because this has been...

2505
01:36:16,210 --> 01:36:17,230
Oh, I don't want to get...

2506
01:36:17,230 --> 01:36:18,530
I don't want to get headshot!

2507
01:36:21,610 --> 01:36:23,250
I don't want to get headshot!

2508
01:36:23,390 --> 01:36:26,170
I don't

2509
01:36:29,360 --> 01:36:29,360
want to get headshot!

2510
01:36:29,360 --> 01:36:29,700
What are you doing?

2511
01:36:29,840 --> 01:36:30,340
Get down here.

2512
01:36:31,580 --> 01:36:31,880
Oh!

2513
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:35,220
What do you mean you're out of ammo?

2514
01:36:35,320 --> 01:36:36,420
You can reload whenever!

2515
01:36:37,200 --> 01:36:38,220
Oh, goodbye.

2516
01:36:41,140 --> 01:36:41,960
Where is she?

2517
01:36:44,440 --> 01:36:45,460
Oh, I'm scared.

2518
01:36:45,860 --> 01:36:47,680
Oh, we don't have supports right now.

2519
01:36:49,820 --> 01:36:50,900
Oh, no, I'm slow.

2520
01:36:51,280 --> 01:36:52,360
Oh, it's okay.

2521
01:36:52,560 --> 01:36:52,960
I'm okay.

2522
01:36:53,700 --> 01:36:54,420
I'm okay.

2523
01:36:54,640 --> 01:36:55,920
I can't do my perk system.

2524
01:36:56,100 --> 01:36:56,600
I'm alive!

2525
01:37:01,510 --> 01:37:03,530
Oh, very useful ult.

2526
01:37:04,110 --> 01:37:04,590
Guys, don't worry.

2527
01:37:05,270 --> 01:37:06,030
Very useful.

2528
01:37:06,810 --> 01:37:07,770
Zoning ult!

2529
01:37:07,970 --> 01:37:08,470
Zoning ult!

2530
01:37:09,450 --> 01:37:09,550
Oh!

2531
01:37:10,170 --> 01:37:11,330
Don't buy...

2532
01:37:11,930 --> 01:37:12,330
Okay.

2533
01:37:15,290 --> 01:37:18,390
Uh, Helix biotic is increased by...

2534
01:37:18,390 --> 01:37:20,990
If they reload 50, they damage an enemy?

2535
01:37:21,090 --> 01:37:21,510
I don't know.

2536
01:37:22,990 --> 01:37:24,670
Guys, it's called zoning ult.

2537
01:37:24,810 --> 01:37:25,350
You don't...

2538
01:37:25,350 --> 01:37:29,410
I know you guys might not have seen it, but it's very crucial in high elo play.

2539
01:37:31,950 --> 01:37:34,030
Guys, everybody does it in high elo.

2540
01:37:34,130 --> 01:37:34,730
You don't understand.

2541
01:37:35,270 --> 01:37:36,470
What is he doing?

2542
01:37:40,390 --> 01:37:41,930
Oh my god.

2543
01:37:41,970 --> 01:37:44,130
Oh my god.

2544
01:37:44,430 --> 01:37:45,730
The classic.

2545
01:37:46,050 --> 01:37:46,470
No!

2546
01:37:48,310 --> 01:37:50,130
I was just trying to...

2547
01:37:50,130 --> 01:37:51,390
The classic.

2548
01:37:52,110 --> 01:37:54,050
Run around in a circle.

2549
01:37:54,350 --> 01:37:55,790
So they can't hit me.

2550
01:37:56,350 --> 01:37:58,550
It's the Overwatch classic.

2551
01:37:59,510 --> 01:38:01,890
Sick head down movement.

2552
01:38:06,570 --> 01:38:07,750
It can't get me.

2553
01:38:07,890 --> 01:38:08,810
It can't get me.

2554
01:38:09,030 --> 01:38:09,750
It can't get me if I run...

2555
01:38:09,750 --> 01:38:09,870
Oh.

2556
01:38:10,190 --> 01:38:11,230
If I run down.

2557
01:38:11,510 --> 01:38:12,610
And look at the floor.

2558
01:38:12,910 --> 01:38:13,530
Where's the map?

2559
01:38:14,590 --> 01:38:15,630
Look at...

2560
01:38:17,290 --> 01:38:17,810
No!

2561
01:38:18,010 --> 01:38:19,450
It's an actual strat!

2562
01:38:20,870 --> 01:38:22,650
Overwatch invented it!

2563
01:38:24,770 --> 01:38:26,050
It's the classic!

2564
01:38:26,330 --> 01:38:27,070
Oh my god!

2565
01:38:27,290 --> 01:38:28,090
Oh my god!

2566
01:38:28,390 --> 01:38:29,570
Oh my god!

2567
01:38:30,370 --> 01:38:31,370
Okay, I'm okay.

2568
01:38:31,630 --> 01:38:32,310
I'm okay.

2569
01:38:38,730 --> 01:38:39,870
Alright, it's fine.

2570
01:38:45,370 --> 01:38:47,590
I'm gonna focus actually on aiming.

2571
01:38:50,090 --> 01:38:50,970
There we go.

2572
01:38:53,370 --> 01:38:54,390
Oh, what the?

2573
01:38:55,550 --> 01:38:56,810
I'm gonna die for this.

2574
01:38:56,950 --> 01:38:57,650
But that's fine.

2575
01:38:58,810 --> 01:38:59,590
I'm okay.

2576
01:38:59,870 --> 01:39:00,950
It was worth it!

2577
01:39:01,130 --> 01:39:02,890
It was worth- It works!

2578
01:39:03,170 --> 01:39:06,210
It's an actual- I've been playing Overwatch since Overwatch 1!

2579
01:39:06,210 --> 01:39:07,610
It's a real strat!

2580
01:39:07,610 --> 01:39:09,750
What are you talking about?

2581
01:39:10,270 --> 01:39:11,790
Everyone does it!

2582
01:39:13,550 --> 01:39:14,010
Okay.

2583
01:39:17,230 --> 01:39:17,910
What?

2584
01:39:18,490 --> 01:39:21,470
It's like, they can't hit you if you just look at the ground.

2585
01:39:22,190 --> 01:39:23,770
It's dumb, but like, it's true.

2586
01:39:28,640 --> 01:39:29,320
Jesus.

2587
01:39:30,400 --> 01:39:31,100
Hello, guys.

2588
01:39:32,420 --> 01:39:32,780
Hi.

2589
01:39:35,780 --> 01:39:36,620
Hello, everybody.

2590
01:39:37,480 --> 01:39:37,840
Guys.

2591
01:39:38,560 --> 01:39:39,160
Please.

2592
01:39:43,100 --> 01:39:43,820
No.

2593
01:39:45,540 --> 01:39:46,260
Goddammit.

2594
01:39:50,630 --> 01:39:51,550
There we go.

2595
01:39:52,610 --> 01:39:53,310
Okay, nice.

2596
01:39:53,670 --> 01:39:54,610
See, we're alive!

2597
01:39:55,590 --> 01:39:56,590
I told you!

2598
01:39:59,090 --> 01:40:00,310
What's that sound?

2599
01:40:00,970 --> 01:40:02,390
Oh, that's that sound.

2600
01:40:03,490 --> 01:40:04,170
Don't worry.

2601
01:40:04,710 --> 01:40:05,570
I'm back.

2602
01:40:05,790 --> 01:40:06,690
I have legs.

2603
01:40:06,970 --> 01:40:08,930
I keep running and I'll keep living.

2604
01:40:13,520 --> 01:40:15,780
Oh, I'll keep running and I'll keep living.

2605
01:40:16,560 --> 01:40:17,740
That's how it works.

2606
01:40:22,610 --> 01:40:23,690
Should I just stay here?

2607
01:40:25,430 --> 01:40:26,550
And just stay here.

2608
01:40:28,370 --> 01:40:29,730
Oh, I can't stay here!

2609
01:40:31,870 --> 01:40:33,070
Please, I'm right here.

2610
01:40:33,590 --> 01:40:34,030
Please.

2611
01:40:35,270 --> 01:40:36,030
They don't know.

2612
01:40:37,230 --> 01:40:38,090
Oh, my God.

2613
01:40:38,250 --> 01:40:38,730
They don't know.

2614
01:40:39,550 --> 01:40:39,990
Oh, my God.

2615
01:40:39,990 --> 01:40:40,590
I can stay here.

2616
01:40:41,750 --> 01:40:42,690
No, they don't know.

2617
01:40:44,050 --> 01:40:44,810
I can stay.

2618
01:40:45,190 --> 01:40:45,950
Oh, my God.

2619
01:40:45,990 --> 01:40:46,530
This is not fair.

2620
01:40:46,610 --> 01:40:47,170
You got heals.

2621
01:40:47,410 --> 01:40:49,830
I got you one HP five different times.

2622
01:40:50,270 --> 01:40:50,630
I...

2623
01:40:54,170 --> 01:40:55,170
I got you.

2624
01:40:55,550 --> 01:40:56,710
It's not fair.

2625
01:40:57,250 --> 01:40:57,790
Oh, my God.

2626
01:40:57,790 --> 01:40:59,410
What is it like to have healings?

2627
01:41:01,330 --> 01:41:02,370
I got...

2628
01:41:02,370 --> 01:41:03,370
It's not fair.

2629
01:41:03,730 --> 01:41:04,410
Oh, my God.

2630
01:41:05,290 --> 01:41:07,730
What is it like to be healed?

2631
01:41:13,430 --> 01:41:14,150
It's fine.

2632
01:41:18,480 --> 01:41:19,160
It's fine.

2633
01:41:19,220 --> 01:41:19,680
I got him.

2634
01:41:19,920 --> 01:41:20,600
That's okay.

2635
01:41:20,860 --> 01:41:21,140
Hello.

2636
01:41:21,540 --> 01:41:21,800
Hello.

2637
01:41:21,800 --> 01:41:23,580
Oh, my God.

2638
01:41:24,540 --> 01:41:25,660
I got my one.

2639
01:41:26,140 --> 01:41:27,660
I got my one.

2640
01:41:29,180 --> 01:41:31,800
How much more do I have to ask for heals?

2641
01:41:36,880 --> 01:41:38,500
I can't believe it.

2642
01:41:43,700 --> 01:41:44,600
Oh, my God.

2643
01:41:44,740 --> 01:41:46,080
I almost got like...

2644
01:41:46,080 --> 01:41:46,700
Hello, guys.

2645
01:41:47,560 --> 01:41:48,780
I'll just stay here for now.

2646
01:41:50,500 --> 01:41:52,320
I forgot to have crouch button.

2647
01:41:55,320 --> 01:41:56,320
I knew it.

2648
01:41:56,500 --> 01:41:58,260
I knew I'm forgetting something.

2649
01:41:58,600 --> 01:42:00,020
I was like, wait a minute.

2650
01:42:00,180 --> 01:42:00,780
I can crouch.

2651
01:42:06,640 --> 01:42:07,240
Jesus.

2652
01:42:08,400 --> 01:42:09,200
Zoning again.

2653
01:42:09,960 --> 01:42:11,760
I knew I forgot something.

2654
01:42:12,680 --> 01:42:14,880
It makes you more unpredictable.

2655
01:42:17,020 --> 01:42:18,120
Oh, my God.

2656
01:42:18,800 --> 01:42:19,620
I'm okay.

2657
01:42:21,400 --> 01:42:22,260
I'm okay.

2658
01:42:24,560 --> 01:42:25,060
Okay.

2659
01:42:25,200 --> 01:42:26,780
I knew I forgot something, though.

2660
01:42:26,900 --> 01:42:27,920
I was like, wait a minute.

2661
01:42:28,060 --> 01:42:29,520
I forgot something in my kit.

2662
01:42:33,760 --> 01:42:34,460
It's okay.

2663
01:42:37,080 --> 01:42:37,880
Get down.

2664
01:42:39,120 --> 01:42:39,540
Oh!

2665
01:42:40,960 --> 01:42:41,460
Oh!

2666
01:42:43,580 --> 01:42:44,840
He ulted me!

2667
01:42:50,600 --> 01:42:51,340
Okay, look.

2668
01:42:51,440 --> 01:42:53,780
I think I am doing my job.

2669
01:42:55,060 --> 01:42:55,680
Oh, man.

2670
01:42:55,940 --> 01:42:56,840
I should have went Tracer.

2671
01:43:02,430 --> 01:43:02,890
Please.

2672
01:43:03,030 --> 01:43:03,430
I'm on point.

2673
01:43:03,590 --> 01:43:04,010
I'm on point.

2674
01:43:04,370 --> 01:43:04,830
Please.

2675
01:43:05,370 --> 01:43:05,710
Please.

2676
01:43:05,870 --> 01:43:06,730
Just heal me.

2677
01:43:07,370 --> 01:43:07,830
Please.

2678
01:43:09,250 --> 01:43:09,710
Please.

2679
01:43:09,990 --> 01:43:10,490
Just heal me.

2680
01:43:10,490 --> 01:43:10,530
Please.

2681
01:43:10,530 --> 01:43:10,950
Oh, my God.

2682
01:43:11,150 --> 01:43:11,290
Please.

2683
01:43:11,970 --> 01:43:13,770
Just a little bit of heal.

2684
01:43:15,370 --> 01:43:19,620
I got one each round.

2685
01:43:19,740 --> 01:43:20,540
Did you not kill him?

2686
01:43:20,680 --> 01:43:20,960
Did you not kill him?

2687
01:43:20,960 --> 01:43:21,620
How did you not kill him?

2688
01:43:21,700 --> 01:43:22,040
He was one!

2689
01:43:22,140 --> 01:43:22,720
I got him one!

2690
01:43:23,200 --> 01:43:23,600
I...

2691
01:43:26,100 --> 01:43:26,840
Oh, man.

2692
01:43:27,560 --> 01:43:27,960
You...

2693
01:43:28,420 --> 01:43:29,480
Oh, my God.

2694
01:43:31,560 --> 01:43:31,960
Oh.

2695
01:43:32,680 --> 01:43:33,800
I did my job.

2696
01:43:33,800 --> 01:43:34,840
I did...

2697
01:43:40,460 --> 01:43:41,280
I did...

2698
01:43:41,280 --> 01:43:41,740
I did my job.

2699
01:43:47,380 --> 01:43:47,860
Alright.

2700
01:43:48,260 --> 01:43:49,100
Back to Freya.

2701
01:43:49,340 --> 01:43:51,480
I was satisfied with...

2702
01:43:51,480 --> 01:43:52,400
with my kills.

2703
01:43:53,580 --> 01:43:54,380
I did...

2704
01:43:54,380 --> 01:43:55,340
I pulled my weight.

2705
01:43:55,600 --> 01:43:57,080
I pulled my weight.

2706
01:43:57,200 --> 01:43:57,840
That's enough.

2707
01:43:58,040 --> 01:43:59,340
Guys, I will check out Stadium.

2708
01:43:59,560 --> 01:44:00,600
Guys, I just see it...

2709
01:44:00,600 --> 01:44:03,480
get warmed up with DPS real fast.

2710
01:44:03,760 --> 01:44:04,600
I was gonna use the back, y'all.

2711
01:44:04,640 --> 01:44:05,000
Be right back.

2712
01:44:21,660 --> 01:44:23,500
Arriving at Yijang Tower.

2713
01:44:28,040 --> 01:44:29,360
Select your hero.

2714
01:44:45,200 --> 01:44:46,320
Alright, I'm back.

2715
01:44:46,720 --> 01:44:48,500
Also, this is like...

2716
01:44:48,940 --> 01:44:49,360
someone actually...

2717
01:44:49,880 --> 01:44:51,720
during my convention at...

2718
01:44:52,860 --> 01:44:53,420
um...

2719
01:44:53,420 --> 01:44:54,960
Tokyo Alley, in Australia.

2720
01:44:55,420 --> 01:44:58,400
Someone asked me like, oh, why don't you stream my DPS?

2721
01:44:58,740 --> 01:45:02,480
And the reason why I don't, is because like, whenever I play DPS...

2722
01:45:03,200 --> 01:45:03,760
um...

2723
01:45:03,760 --> 01:45:07,180
When I play DPS, my brain is so overloaded...

2724
01:45:07,180 --> 01:45:09,080
with things I have to do as DPS...

2725
01:45:09,080 --> 01:45:10,780
versus as support...

2726
01:45:10,780 --> 01:45:13,560
that it's so hard to like, talk to you guys...

2727
01:45:13,560 --> 01:45:14,620
when I'm playing DPS...

2728
01:45:14,620 --> 01:45:16,020
because I'm like...

2729
01:45:16,020 --> 01:45:16,380
I...

2730
01:45:16,380 --> 01:45:18,460
my brain is like, trying to...

2731
01:45:18,460 --> 01:45:18,940
kill.

2732
01:45:18,940 --> 01:45:19,680
like...

2733
01:45:22,580 --> 01:45:23,700
I have...

2734
01:45:23,700 --> 01:45:25,720
I have to focus on like...

2735
01:45:25,720 --> 01:45:26,960
killing things...

2736
01:45:26,960 --> 01:45:27,140
and...

2737
01:45:27,140 --> 01:45:28,900
while support, I can just be like...

2738
01:45:28,900 --> 01:45:29,560
it's so...

2739
01:45:29,560 --> 01:45:31,000
it's just easier...

2740
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:31,560
It's...

2741
01:45:31,560 --> 01:45:33,000
I DAREWINSTON!

2742
01:45:33,400 --> 01:45:34,020
It's...

2743
01:45:34,020 --> 01:45:35,060
oh my god...

2744
01:45:35,060 --> 01:45:35,180
okay.

2745
01:45:36,120 --> 01:45:36,740
It's...

2746
01:45:36,740 --> 01:45:38,740
it's easier to actually...

2747
01:45:40,720 --> 01:45:43,180
It's just easier to like...

2748
01:45:45,910 --> 01:45:47,030
oh my god...

2749
01:45:49,690 --> 01:45:53,230
It's much easier to like, get...

2750
01:45:53,230 --> 01:45:54,830
like talk and interact with chat...

2751
01:45:54,830 --> 01:45:57,790
when I'm not trying to focus on getting headshots...

2752
01:45:57,790 --> 01:46:01,830
Like, I was like, my brain was like, how to talk.

2753
01:46:03,750 --> 01:46:06,830
Oh my god, team, are you guys okay, team?

2754
01:46:10,080 --> 01:46:11,340
I love hitscan.

2755
01:46:14,080 --> 01:46:15,440
I love hitscan.

2756
01:46:18,820 --> 01:46:19,660
Hitscan fun.

2757
01:46:22,220 --> 01:46:22,740
Sorry.

2758
01:46:29,350 --> 01:46:30,150
There we go.

2759
01:46:30,590 --> 01:46:31,490
Hitscan fun.

2760
01:46:34,250 --> 01:46:36,470
Why would you go Pharah?

2761
01:46:36,610 --> 01:46:37,550
They have an Ashe.

2762
01:46:38,970 --> 01:46:40,230
Are you dumb?

2763
01:46:47,790 --> 01:46:49,390
Wait, you're not.

2764
01:46:51,990 --> 01:46:53,370
Like, are you dumb?

2765
01:46:59,150 --> 01:47:00,590
Oh, goddammit.

2766
01:47:01,530 --> 01:47:05,010
I got, I got really, uh, what's the word?

2767
01:47:06,810 --> 01:47:08,830
I got very cocky there.

2768
01:47:11,850 --> 01:47:13,330
I need to remember that I can crouch.

2769
01:47:15,750 --> 01:47:16,190
Juno!

2770
01:47:16,670 --> 01:47:17,410
Juno, please!

2771
01:47:18,110 --> 01:47:21,490
Also, I play support because, like, stuff like this kills me.

2772
01:47:22,150 --> 01:47:23,770
Uh, regen for each enemy target.

2773
01:47:24,010 --> 01:47:24,730
For an hammer individual.

2774
01:47:24,950 --> 01:47:25,070
Okay.

2775
01:47:25,550 --> 01:47:26,270
I don't know.

2776
01:47:26,390 --> 01:47:27,090
I don't know if that's good.

2777
01:47:27,630 --> 01:47:29,090
I got really greedy there.

2778
01:47:34,590 --> 01:47:35,030
Hello.

2779
01:47:36,290 --> 01:47:36,730
Please.

2780
01:47:49,440 --> 01:47:50,500
Oh my god, please.

2781
01:47:53,080 --> 01:47:53,860
Oh, no.

2782
01:47:53,940 --> 01:47:54,420
Nice.

2783
01:47:58,430 --> 01:47:59,070
There we go.

2784
01:47:59,190 --> 01:47:59,410
Nice.

2785
01:48:02,610 --> 01:48:04,090
Oh my god, where's the dragon?

2786
01:48:04,330 --> 01:48:04,830
There he is.

2787
01:48:07,570 --> 01:48:08,050
No!

2788
01:48:08,430 --> 01:48:09,150
I got greedy!

2789
01:48:09,890 --> 01:48:11,530
I got greedy!

2790
01:48:12,230 --> 01:48:14,250
I got so greedy!

2791
01:48:15,550 --> 01:48:17,590
I was like, I don't...

2792
01:48:17,590 --> 01:48:18,850
He's not gonna hit that shot.

2793
01:48:19,050 --> 01:48:21,190
He's not gonna hit that shot.

2794
01:48:22,950 --> 01:48:24,090
Oh my god.

2795
01:48:24,410 --> 01:48:27,630
My brain is not ready for this.

2796
01:48:29,150 --> 01:48:30,310
My brain...

2797
01:48:30,310 --> 01:48:31,450
My brain...

2798
01:48:36,460 --> 01:48:37,180
That's right.

2799
01:48:37,340 --> 01:48:37,640
Peek me.

2800
01:48:37,780 --> 01:48:39,040
Oh my god, not like that.

2801
01:48:41,020 --> 01:48:42,000
Not like that.

2802
01:48:42,180 --> 01:48:42,480
No!

2803
01:48:42,760 --> 01:48:43,120
Please!

2804
01:48:43,480 --> 01:48:44,860
I was right behind you!

2805
01:48:45,600 --> 01:48:48,360
Just a little bit of crumb!

2806
01:48:48,900 --> 01:48:50,760
That's all I ask!

2807
01:48:52,020 --> 01:48:54,760
A little bit of heal crumb!

2808
01:48:55,180 --> 01:48:55,780
Please!

2809
01:48:56,300 --> 01:48:58,060
Don't make me go support!

2810
01:48:58,840 --> 01:49:02,740
I also go support when I get mad with lack of heals.

2811
01:49:11,860 --> 01:49:14,940
I'm swapping off Kass.

2812
01:49:15,080 --> 01:49:16,580
I'm sorry!

2813
01:49:22,940 --> 01:49:24,680
Daddy's angry!

2814
01:49:26,440 --> 01:49:27,360
I can't!

2815
01:49:27,500 --> 01:49:28,320
I just rolled Q!

2816
01:49:31,300 --> 01:49:32,680
What are they on?

2817
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:33,680
I don't remember.

2818
01:49:34,800 --> 01:49:36,280
Because I don't think... No, they're on Hanzo.

2819
01:49:36,420 --> 01:49:37,820
They were so grouped up.

2820
01:49:38,220 --> 01:49:40,220
I was gonna say, I could have played Tracer.

2821
01:49:44,920 --> 01:49:45,960
It's fine.

2822
01:49:46,840 --> 01:49:47,160
Look.

2823
01:49:48,120 --> 01:49:49,160
Guys, it's animated.

2824
01:49:49,680 --> 01:49:52,080
I have a lot of the animated ones.

2825
01:49:52,340 --> 01:49:52,600
Look.

2826
01:49:53,060 --> 01:49:54,680
This one I know life this game.

2827
01:49:54,920 --> 01:49:55,120
Look.

2828
01:49:58,760 --> 01:50:00,360
I mean, I'm hitting my shots, though.

2829
01:50:02,040 --> 01:50:03,180
I'm hitting my shots.

2830
01:50:03,180 --> 01:50:05,640
It's just that... I just need a little bit more heal.

2831
01:50:06,780 --> 01:50:07,460
That's it.

2832
01:50:07,840 --> 01:50:09,440
I literally just need heals.

2833
01:50:09,640 --> 01:50:10,640
And then I can live.

2834
01:50:12,940 --> 01:50:14,800
Like, I have to play next to my healers.

2835
01:50:21,690 --> 01:50:22,410
I'm lucky.

2836
01:50:23,930 --> 01:50:24,390
Wait.

2837
01:50:24,610 --> 01:50:25,450
Where's our team?

2838
01:50:28,190 --> 01:50:28,950
I'm lucky.

2839
01:50:36,330 --> 01:50:37,350
Oh, he's so low.

2840
01:50:37,650 --> 01:50:38,070
Nice.

2841
01:50:38,230 --> 01:50:38,570
I got him.

2842
01:50:41,010 --> 01:50:41,530
No.

2843
01:50:41,790 --> 01:50:42,090
Please.

2844
01:50:42,430 --> 01:50:42,910
Please.

2845
01:50:43,550 --> 01:50:44,090
Oh, my God.

2846
01:50:44,170 --> 01:50:44,490
Thank God.

2847
01:50:47,510 --> 01:50:48,030
Nice.

2848
01:50:49,550 --> 01:50:50,330
There we go.

2849
01:50:50,690 --> 01:50:51,410
Oh, my God.

2850
01:50:51,530 --> 01:50:53,010
The Ana actually healed me.

2851
01:50:53,090 --> 01:50:53,910
I'm so happy.

2852
01:50:54,570 --> 01:50:55,310
Hey, what do I want?

2853
01:50:55,470 --> 01:50:57,530
Casting throws that travels both.

2854
01:50:57,850 --> 01:51:00,770
Griddle hits reduces the cooldown of combat rule.

2855
01:51:01,190 --> 01:51:01,710
Wait.

2856
01:51:01,730 --> 01:51:02,190
Is that good?

2857
01:51:02,450 --> 01:51:02,910
Let's try.

2858
01:51:02,910 --> 01:51:05,250
I don't know what...

2859
01:51:07,810 --> 01:51:08,430
Wait.

2860
01:51:08,490 --> 01:51:09,090
They hacked it.

2861
01:51:09,250 --> 01:51:09,870
Oh, no.

2862
01:51:10,830 --> 01:51:11,790
What was that?

2863
01:51:15,300 --> 01:51:15,920
Nice.

2864
01:51:20,120 --> 01:51:20,740
Oh.

2865
01:51:21,200 --> 01:51:22,180
I forgot.

2866
01:51:22,460 --> 01:51:23,480
My oldest just cosmetic.

2867
01:51:25,960 --> 01:51:26,580
Okay.

2868
01:51:31,360 --> 01:51:32,020
Where would he go?

2869
01:51:32,540 --> 01:51:33,560
Where would he go?

2870
01:51:34,320 --> 01:51:36,720
Oh, the Hanzo can hack the pack?

2871
01:51:36,720 --> 01:51:37,800
I was like...

2872
01:51:37,800 --> 01:51:38,960
They have Sombra?

2873
01:51:39,060 --> 01:51:39,880
I was so confused.

2874
01:51:42,540 --> 01:51:44,600
I was like wondering if that was a Sombra.

2875
01:51:49,850 --> 01:51:51,070
Oh, he was one.

2876
01:51:53,010 --> 01:51:55,250
And they say...

2877
01:52:00,270 --> 01:52:02,010
I feel like he has...

2878
01:52:02,010 --> 01:52:02,090
Yep.

2879
01:52:02,710 --> 01:52:03,190
What?

2880
01:52:03,350 --> 01:52:04,370
I was behind it!

2881
01:52:05,090 --> 01:52:06,230
Are you serious?

2882
01:52:07,170 --> 01:52:08,130
Are you serious?

2883
01:52:08,290 --> 01:52:09,790
I was behind it.

2884
01:52:10,050 --> 01:52:12,730
I refuse to believe I was not behind it.

2885
01:52:16,560 --> 01:52:18,620
I knew he had...

2886
01:52:21,020 --> 01:52:21,860
There we go.

2887
01:52:22,600 --> 01:52:22,900
I...

2888
01:52:22,900 --> 01:52:23,080
No!

2889
01:52:23,260 --> 01:52:24,080
Not the orb!

2890
01:52:24,320 --> 01:52:25,200
Not the orb!

2891
01:52:30,350 --> 01:52:31,490
Yeah, I was like...

2892
01:52:31,490 --> 01:52:33,210
When did Hanzo know how to hack?

2893
01:52:33,210 --> 01:52:33,650
Alright.

2894
01:52:33,930 --> 01:52:35,070
I don't need perks.

2895
01:52:35,770 --> 01:52:37,170
I don't need perks.

2896
01:52:37,330 --> 01:52:38,730
I just gotta be fast.

2897
01:52:39,630 --> 01:52:40,990
Just mora things, you know?

2898
01:52:41,410 --> 01:52:42,130
Just little...

2899
01:52:42,130 --> 01:52:44,270
Just little mora things.

2900
01:52:46,950 --> 01:52:48,870
Just little mora things.

2901
01:52:49,510 --> 01:52:50,290
There we go.

2902
01:52:51,650 --> 01:52:53,270
Oh, I forgot one more round.

2903
01:52:53,470 --> 01:52:53,610
Oops.

2904
01:52:54,230 --> 01:52:55,930
I forgot one more round!

2905
01:52:56,070 --> 01:52:56,550
Oh, it's okay.

2906
01:53:05,130 --> 01:53:05,650
Okay.

2907
01:53:06,030 --> 01:53:06,490
So...

2908
01:53:06,490 --> 01:53:07,790
I don't know the...

2909
01:53:09,090 --> 01:53:09,810
I don't...

2910
01:53:09,810 --> 01:53:12,290
I don't know the distance for the melee combo.

2911
01:53:12,590 --> 01:53:13,570
It's been...

2912
01:53:13,570 --> 01:53:14,150
Too long.

2913
01:53:14,990 --> 01:53:18,950
A good tracer knows the melee combo for blinks and I don't...

2914
01:53:18,950 --> 01:53:20,290
I don't...

2915
01:53:20,290 --> 01:53:22,070
But I'm not a good tracer.

2916
01:53:24,370 --> 01:53:26,210
Why are even my perks for this one?

2917
01:53:26,450 --> 01:53:27,490
Can I see it?

2918
01:53:30,110 --> 01:53:31,130
What is it?

2919
01:53:31,530 --> 01:53:31,810
What...

2920
01:53:31,810 --> 01:53:32,230
Okay, guys.

2921
01:53:32,690 --> 01:53:33,890
Tell me what perks to get!

2922
01:53:34,110 --> 01:53:34,690
Right now!

2923
01:53:36,890 --> 01:53:37,390
Tell me!

2924
01:53:40,850 --> 01:53:41,410
Guys!

2925
01:53:41,850 --> 01:53:42,750
Overwatch veterans!

2926
01:53:42,750 --> 01:53:43,710
What perks?

2927
01:53:43,850 --> 01:53:44,290
1-1?

2928
01:53:44,510 --> 01:53:44,750
Okay.

2929
01:53:45,750 --> 01:53:46,130
I believe.

2930
01:53:46,470 --> 01:53:46,850
Left, left.

2931
01:53:47,390 --> 01:53:48,450
Okay, I believe.

2932
01:53:52,150 --> 01:53:52,670
Alright.

2933
01:53:53,170 --> 01:53:53,670
Wait, what?

2934
01:53:55,710 --> 01:53:56,590
Oh my god.

2935
01:53:57,490 --> 01:53:57,690
Unlock.

2936
01:53:57,770 --> 01:53:58,370
Wait, they win!

2937
01:53:59,850 --> 01:54:00,790
Oh my god.

2938
01:54:01,070 --> 01:54:02,090
They win Cassidy!

2939
01:54:03,110 --> 01:54:04,070
That's not fair!

2940
01:54:06,090 --> 01:54:08,270
They actually win Cassidy.

2941
01:54:11,170 --> 01:54:12,210
Okay, that's fine.

2942
01:54:14,430 --> 01:54:16,310
I can't believe they win Cassidy.

2943
01:54:16,450 --> 01:54:16,690
Okay.

2944
01:54:17,190 --> 01:54:18,510
That's bad for me.

2945
01:54:21,710 --> 01:54:22,810
There you go.

2946
01:54:28,990 --> 01:54:33,210
Aw, you're a bitch if you need that to just to...

2947
01:54:33,210 --> 01:54:34,950
Oh, you're such a bitch!

2948
01:54:34,950 --> 01:54:34,970
Ooof!

2949
01:54:35,710 --> 01:54:36,050
Hahaha.

2950
01:54:44,580 --> 01:54:45,260
Hahaha.

2951
01:54:47,860 --> 01:54:48,340
Hahaha.

2952
01:54:48,340 --> 01:54:48,440
Hahaha.

2953
01:54:48,440 --> 01:54:48,920
Hahahaha.

2954
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:51,020
He här.

2955
01:54:52,120 --> 01:54:52,800
Oh.

2956
01:54:56,090 --> 01:54:56,770
Oh.

2957
01:54:57,270 --> 01:54:59,650
I like tracer only because of tracking.

2958
01:54:59,910 --> 01:55:01,930
I'm not the best Tracer player, obviously.

2959
01:55:11,040 --> 01:55:14,380
Oh, you're pranked now!

2960
01:55:15,700 --> 01:55:18,600
Counter me more, please!

2961
01:55:22,500 --> 01:55:23,900
Please!

2962
01:55:24,540 --> 01:55:27,120
Please counter me more!

2963
01:55:27,820 --> 01:55:29,380
Jesus Christ!

2964
01:55:34,940 --> 01:55:36,780
Oh, man.

2965
01:55:37,420 --> 01:55:37,880
Fine.

2966
01:55:38,460 --> 01:55:43,240
I am actual cowards.

2967
01:55:46,300 --> 01:55:54,280
All I'm saying is they clearly... There we go.

2968
01:56:01,370 --> 01:56:02,350
Oh, my god.

2969
01:56:05,590 --> 01:56:06,610
I'm not gonna live.

2970
01:56:06,710 --> 01:56:09,990
I know I'm not gonna live, so I'm like, I'm just stalling as much as I can.

2971
01:56:11,290 --> 01:56:13,030
There's no way for me to live!

2972
01:56:15,570 --> 01:56:17,430
Oh, they just got... It's fine.

2973
01:56:19,450 --> 01:56:20,090
No!

2974
01:56:20,390 --> 01:56:21,250
He was so close!

2975
01:56:23,190 --> 01:56:23,830
Alright.

2976
01:56:24,830 --> 01:56:26,210
Okay, I have to swap.

2977
01:56:26,650 --> 01:56:28,390
They are full-on countering me.

2978
01:56:28,850 --> 01:56:29,870
I'm sad.

2979
01:56:30,230 --> 01:56:32,970
I wanted to play Tracer!

2980
01:56:34,730 --> 01:56:35,930
Come on!

2981
01:56:36,730 --> 01:56:37,790
I'm regrouping.

2982
01:56:38,850 --> 01:56:39,950
I'm sad.

2983
01:56:54,940 --> 01:56:55,900
Oh, my god.

2984
01:56:56,080 --> 01:56:56,360
Really?

2985
01:56:58,820 --> 01:57:00,000
There's nothing I can do.

2986
01:57:00,460 --> 01:57:01,700
You got the health pack, too.

2987
01:57:02,560 --> 01:57:02,840
No!

2988
01:57:04,120 --> 01:57:04,760
No!

2989
01:57:06,740 --> 01:57:08,420
It's not fair!

2990
01:57:09,180 --> 01:57:10,860
I have to swap!

2991
01:57:10,860 --> 01:57:11,000
I have to swap!

2992
01:57:12,960 --> 01:57:14,100
You guys suck!

2993
01:57:14,380 --> 01:57:16,320
I want to play Tracer!

2994
01:57:19,360 --> 01:57:20,400
No fun.

2995
01:57:20,940 --> 01:57:23,360
No fun.

2996
01:57:23,740 --> 01:57:25,000
Actual no fun.

2997
01:57:25,420 --> 01:57:27,180
We don't have anybody in touch, though.

2998
01:57:28,380 --> 01:57:28,520
Yeah.

2999
01:57:29,620 --> 01:57:30,820
You guys suck!

3000
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:33,300
I just want to play Tracer!

3001
01:57:36,900 --> 01:57:38,720
Just play Tracer!

3002
01:57:39,180 --> 01:57:40,180
Don't die!

3003
01:57:43,160 --> 01:57:44,760
They went...

3004
01:57:44,760 --> 01:57:50,180
Cast and Brig and Morag... I mean, they went Brig and that's when I couldn't do anything anymore.

3005
01:57:50,480 --> 01:57:52,800
I couldn't do anything after that!

3006
01:57:53,240 --> 01:57:55,640
To stadium gel with you!

3007
01:58:01,600 --> 01:58:02,040
No!

3008
01:58:02,260 --> 01:58:02,260
No!

3009
01:58:02,320 --> 01:58:03,820
Okay, but what if I do one more?

3010
01:58:06,800 --> 01:58:08,540
What if I do one more?

3011
01:58:09,100 --> 01:58:11,320
What if I do one more?

3012
01:58:11,360 --> 01:58:11,920
What if I do one more quick flip?

3013
01:58:13,040 --> 01:58:13,900
You know what?

3014
01:58:15,880 --> 01:58:16,680
I'll do either.

3015
01:58:17,640 --> 01:58:19,760
I'll do either because I got a little tilted at our supports.

3016
01:58:22,900 --> 01:58:25,000
Guys, you know when I do stadium!

3017
01:58:25,620 --> 01:58:28,500
When I do stadium, you know what gel I'm...

3018
01:58:28,500 --> 01:58:29,180
Wait, actually, no.

3019
01:58:29,320 --> 01:58:31,740
We get to see support when we're in stadium.

3020
01:58:32,160 --> 01:58:34,640
We get to see support when we're in stadium!

3021
01:58:35,220 --> 01:58:37,820
This is a rare moment where I can play DPS.

3022
01:58:42,220 --> 01:58:44,080
This is a rare moment.

3023
01:58:46,020 --> 01:58:47,240
Alright, let's try it.

3024
01:58:47,240 --> 01:58:49,260
I always deliver.

3025
01:58:50,040 --> 01:58:53,380
When I play stadium, you know what gel I'm gonna be in!

3026
01:58:55,900 --> 01:58:57,440
Oh, wait, he's bad.

3027
01:59:05,330 --> 01:59:05,850
Okay.

3028
01:59:10,720 --> 01:59:12,080
Oh, no, that's not what I wanted.

3029
01:59:14,960 --> 01:59:15,900
Oh, whoops.

3030
01:59:16,440 --> 01:59:18,480
Oh my god, that Lucio threw me off.

3031
01:59:19,220 --> 01:59:20,760
Lucio made me look at him!

3032
01:59:21,880 --> 01:59:23,400
I was like, what was that?

3033
01:59:25,380 --> 01:59:25,900
Alright.

3034
01:59:26,380 --> 01:59:27,160
That's fine.

3035
01:59:27,840 --> 01:59:29,620
How do I have long road queue for it?

3036
01:59:32,600 --> 01:59:34,040
What is this Lucio doing?

3037
01:59:34,160 --> 01:59:35,140
This is deathmatch!

3038
01:59:36,680 --> 01:59:38,300
The Lucio destra- Oh, no!

3039
01:59:39,340 --> 01:59:40,900
Got the venture out of nowhere!

3040
01:59:44,240 --> 01:59:44,920
Oh, no!

3041
01:59:44,980 --> 01:59:45,680
He can't do anything!

3042
01:59:45,820 --> 01:59:46,220
He's hacked!

3043
01:59:50,330 --> 01:59:50,810
No.

3044
01:59:51,310 --> 01:59:52,190
How dare you!

3045
01:59:54,990 --> 01:59:55,770
There we go.

3046
01:59:56,230 --> 01:59:56,530
Yeah!

3047
01:59:57,590 --> 01:59:59,510
Alright, finally I'm getting killed.

3048
02:00:01,150 --> 02:00:03,450
I'm remembering how to crouch spam, guys.

3049
02:00:03,450 --> 02:00:05,310
It's been a long time, but...

3050
02:00:05,310 --> 02:00:05,890
Are you serious?

3051
02:00:06,010 --> 02:00:06,470
Okay, there you go.

3052
02:00:07,030 --> 02:00:09,550
It's been a while, but I can crouch spam down.

3053
02:00:11,810 --> 02:00:12,770
Oh my god.

3054
02:00:14,070 --> 02:00:17,050
At least, like, it makes it harder for them to aim.

3055
02:00:19,470 --> 02:00:20,730
Everyone should play torpedo?

3056
02:00:21,990 --> 02:00:22,350
Who's torpedo?

3057
02:00:23,550 --> 02:00:24,870
But it's been a while.

3058
02:00:25,130 --> 02:00:27,150
But I'm getting my muscle memory back.

3059
02:00:32,830 --> 02:00:33,310
Oh.

3060
02:00:34,310 --> 02:00:35,970
Okay, who- Who the heck plays hog?

3061
02:00:36,370 --> 02:00:37,390
In deathmatch?

3062
02:00:37,570 --> 02:00:39,050
What are you doing?

3063
02:00:40,030 --> 02:00:42,090
I hate hog players in deathmatch.

3064
02:00:44,710 --> 02:00:45,950
Oh, torpedo Juno?

3065
02:00:46,930 --> 02:00:47,650
Wait, okay.

3066
02:00:47,710 --> 02:00:48,570
You guys gotta teach me.

3067
02:00:48,830 --> 02:00:51,050
You guys gotta teach me the right builds.

3068
02:00:54,550 --> 02:00:55,030
Alright.

3069
02:00:55,630 --> 02:00:57,390
Okay, I'll do Freya, and then I'll do stadium.

3070
02:00:57,910 --> 02:00:58,670
Right after.

3071
02:01:01,690 --> 02:01:05,330
I saw you got hacked by Sombra and gave me PTSD.

3072
02:01:06,390 --> 02:01:07,390
Okay, okay.

3073
02:01:07,710 --> 02:01:08,710
After this, I'll do stadium.

3074
02:01:10,050 --> 02:01:11,010
It's Freya time.

3075
02:01:11,230 --> 02:01:13,990
I'm satisfied with the last two DPS games.

3076
02:01:19,430 --> 02:01:21,910
Okay, so what do you do for a torpedo Juno?

3077
02:01:22,330 --> 02:01:23,610
Give me the most...

3078
02:01:23,610 --> 02:01:26,890
Most broken builds you can do in stadium.

3079
02:01:29,370 --> 02:01:29,910
Wait.

3080
02:01:30,270 --> 02:01:31,310
How busted is it?

3081
02:01:31,930 --> 02:01:32,490
Okay, guys.

3082
02:01:32,610 --> 02:01:33,190
You gotta teach me.

3083
02:01:34,610 --> 02:01:37,910
Basically, Ability, Damage, Fast, Torpedo, Cooldown.

3084
02:01:38,310 --> 02:01:39,550
Stack Ability, Power?

3085
02:01:40,090 --> 02:01:42,450
I heard, like, there's so many busted builds.

3086
02:01:47,830 --> 02:01:50,670
All right, and then you guys teach me the busted Juno build.

3087
02:01:51,510 --> 02:01:52,890
I wanna try that out.

3088
02:01:55,810 --> 02:01:57,470
She nanos the whole team?!

3089
02:01:58,490 --> 02:01:59,670
Okay, we're doing that.

3090
02:02:01,390 --> 02:02:04,270
We're doing that after Juno torpedo build.

3091
02:02:06,390 --> 02:02:08,150
We're right after that.

3092
02:02:08,330 --> 02:02:09,510
That sounds amazing.

3093
02:02:13,070 --> 02:02:14,450
That sounds insane.

3094
02:02:14,690 --> 02:02:15,770
Okay, our tank's dead.

3095
02:02:16,170 --> 02:02:16,310
All right.

3096
02:02:16,510 --> 02:02:17,890
Why did he...

3097
02:02:17,890 --> 02:02:20,250
How did he die so fast?!

3098
02:02:20,250 --> 02:02:21,650
Oh my god.

3099
02:02:23,010 --> 02:02:23,390
Poor guy.

3100
02:02:26,250 --> 02:02:27,010
Okay.

3101
02:02:27,890 --> 02:02:28,870
He's here.

3102
02:02:32,800 --> 02:02:33,700
Oh no.

3103
02:02:35,120 --> 02:02:35,680
No.

3104
02:02:36,780 --> 02:02:37,580
Here, go, please!

3105
02:02:42,440 --> 02:02:43,040
Okay.

3106
02:02:46,610 --> 02:02:47,310
All right.

3107
02:02:50,880 --> 02:02:51,480
Oh.

3108
02:02:54,600 --> 02:02:55,040
All right.

3109
02:02:55,340 --> 02:02:56,620
Let me try...

3110
02:02:56,620 --> 02:02:59,200
Hey, at least I'm building up really, really fast.

3111
02:02:59,400 --> 02:03:00,760
Because he's my ult battery.

3112
02:03:06,430 --> 02:03:07,170
All right.

3113
02:03:10,250 --> 02:03:11,310
All right, I got it.

3114
02:03:15,490 --> 02:03:15,890
Nice.

3115
02:03:16,230 --> 02:03:16,510
All right.

3116
02:03:16,730 --> 02:03:17,910
I can see the appeal now.

3117
02:03:18,490 --> 02:03:19,130
When they're all...

3118
02:03:19,590 --> 02:03:20,550
grouped up like that.

3119
02:03:22,610 --> 02:03:23,010
Nice.

3120
02:03:23,410 --> 02:03:24,050
All right, what's up?

3121
02:03:24,270 --> 02:03:25,410
Okay, frost bolts is actually bad.

3122
02:03:25,490 --> 02:03:26,670
Wait, have we not killed the hog?

3123
02:03:27,230 --> 02:03:27,730
Bro, what?

3124
02:03:28,210 --> 02:03:29,070
Where's the hog?

3125
02:03:29,670 --> 02:03:32,250
Who just let him walk away like that?!

3126
02:03:34,210 --> 02:03:34,610
What?!

3127
02:03:34,610 --> 02:03:36,310
He's just standing there!

3128
02:03:36,590 --> 02:03:38,010
Oh no, not the mercy.

3129
02:03:38,010 --> 02:03:39,030
Not the...

3130
02:03:40,010 --> 02:03:40,990
Strong ass mercy res.

3131
02:03:41,870 --> 02:03:43,190
He doesn't even have Valk!

3132
02:03:43,670 --> 02:03:45,350
Oh no, but she brought back the hog.

3133
02:03:45,670 --> 02:03:46,710
The raid boss.

3134
02:03:48,570 --> 02:03:49,430
All right, here we go.

3135
02:03:52,530 --> 02:03:53,310
That's fine.

3136
02:03:53,510 --> 02:03:54,110
That's not fine.

3137
02:03:54,190 --> 02:03:54,810
My team's dead.

3138
02:03:55,970 --> 02:03:57,050
My team's dead.

3139
02:03:57,050 --> 02:03:57,730
That's okay.

3140
02:03:58,710 --> 02:03:59,770
Please, Ana, please.

3141
02:04:00,070 --> 02:04:01,530
I'm right in front of you, Ana.

3142
02:04:09,060 --> 02:04:09,620
Please.

3143
02:04:09,900 --> 02:04:10,400
Thank you.

3144
02:04:10,900 --> 02:04:11,840
Oh my god.

3145
02:04:12,040 --> 02:04:12,260
This...

3146
02:04:12,260 --> 02:04:13,440
I'm actually getting healed, guys.

3147
02:04:13,680 --> 02:04:14,620
It's actually crazy.

3148
02:04:14,620 --> 02:04:15,640
I don't know how that feels.

3149
02:04:15,820 --> 02:04:15,900
Oh!

3150
02:04:17,840 --> 02:04:18,660
Never mind.

3151
02:04:18,660 --> 02:04:19,540
I got headshot.

3152
02:04:20,060 --> 02:04:20,460
I...

3153
02:04:20,460 --> 02:04:21,760
I got...

3154
02:04:21,760 --> 02:04:23,420
I got headshots.

3155
02:04:23,480 --> 02:04:24,400
That's okay.

3156
02:04:25,240 --> 02:04:25,660
I...

3157
02:04:26,480 --> 02:04:28,880
Healing doesn't save me from headshots.

3158
02:04:29,460 --> 02:04:30,020
Apparently.

3159
02:04:30,890 --> 02:04:32,160
Cannot heal that.

3160
02:04:32,620 --> 02:04:33,300
Oops.

3161
02:04:34,850 --> 02:04:36,720
I almost felt like a guy.

3162
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:39,840
I was getting healed.

3163
02:04:42,750 --> 02:04:43,460
Oh my god.

3164
02:04:43,560 --> 02:04:45,080
We finally killed a raid boss.

3165
02:04:46,280 --> 02:04:47,440
You thought you...

3166
02:04:47,990 --> 02:04:48,820
Never mind.

3167
02:04:49,180 --> 02:04:50,440
I didn't break it.

3168
02:04:51,060 --> 02:04:51,520
Okay.

3169
02:04:51,880 --> 02:04:53,860
Sorry, I timed it incorrectly.

3170
02:04:54,500 --> 02:04:56,400
I thought my...

3171
02:04:56,400 --> 02:04:58,240
I thought I did more damage.

3172
02:04:58,620 --> 02:04:59,320
I...

3173
02:05:00,820 --> 02:05:02,300
It should work.

3174
02:05:02,780 --> 02:05:03,640
Theoretically.

3175
02:05:03,940 --> 02:05:05,040
It should work.

3176
02:05:06,840 --> 02:05:08,580
But it didn't.

3177
02:05:10,760 --> 02:05:12,040
That's fine.

3178
02:05:13,080 --> 02:05:14,860
Excellent timing.

3179
02:05:19,540 --> 02:05:21,760
I messed up a little.

3180
02:05:21,760 --> 02:05:22,340
Haha.

3181
02:05:25,460 --> 02:05:26,140
Weeeee.

3182
02:05:27,620 --> 02:05:29,120
That was painful.

3183
02:05:29,780 --> 02:05:30,880
I got hooked.

3184
02:05:31,420 --> 02:05:32,180
Classic Overwatch.

3185
02:05:32,580 --> 02:05:34,680
Some things never change, you know?

3186
02:05:37,860 --> 02:05:39,920
Some things just never change.

3187
02:05:40,160 --> 02:05:40,480
Okay, on.

3188
02:05:40,620 --> 02:05:40,700
Oh.

3189
02:05:41,200 --> 02:05:42,200
Just like that.

3190
02:05:42,520 --> 02:05:44,540
Some things just never change.

3191
02:05:44,880 --> 02:05:46,760
A slight miscalculation.

3192
02:05:48,820 --> 02:05:53,040
Okay, but this Freya gameplay is a lot better than the first time I played Freya.

3193
02:05:53,120 --> 02:05:54,520
I'm a little bit more warmed up now.

3194
02:05:55,120 --> 02:06:00,000
And if I have to, I will play Reaper because this hog is pissing me off.

3195
02:06:04,240 --> 02:06:05,440
If I have to.

3196
02:06:07,200 --> 02:06:08,300
I will play.

3197
02:06:09,120 --> 02:06:10,760
I will play Reaper.

3198
02:06:11,580 --> 02:06:13,780
Hello soldier, can I borrow some heals?

3199
02:06:13,780 --> 02:06:14,460
Alright.

3200
02:06:14,660 --> 02:06:14,800
No.

3201
02:06:15,360 --> 02:06:16,100
That's fine.

3202
02:06:16,660 --> 02:06:17,280
Thank you.

3203
02:06:21,080 --> 02:06:21,520
Alright.

3204
02:06:25,210 --> 02:06:25,650
Nice.

3205
02:06:25,850 --> 02:06:26,350
Okay, I got it.

3206
02:06:26,510 --> 02:06:26,790
Whoa!

3207
02:06:30,450 --> 02:06:31,330
Jesus Christ.

3208
02:06:31,670 --> 02:06:32,530
Alright, that's it.

3209
02:06:32,750 --> 02:06:33,470
Okay, after I ult.

3210
02:06:33,970 --> 02:06:34,770
After I ult.

3211
02:06:34,770 --> 02:06:37,110
Uh, grants temporary free use.

3212
02:06:37,190 --> 02:06:39,830
Oh yeah, the four unlimited ammo.

3213
02:06:41,550 --> 02:06:42,070
Alright.

3214
02:06:45,870 --> 02:06:47,590
Wait, is hog not in stadium?

3215
02:06:47,970 --> 02:06:48,950
Oh my god!

3216
02:06:49,810 --> 02:06:51,250
Oh my god, okay.

3217
02:06:51,570 --> 02:06:52,630
I was looking at chat.

3218
02:06:53,290 --> 02:06:54,730
Wait, is hog not in stadium?

3219
02:06:55,050 --> 02:06:57,630
Is it like a predetermined match of heroes?

3220
02:07:03,350 --> 02:07:04,150
I don't care.

3221
02:07:04,230 --> 02:07:04,590
I want him.

3222
02:07:04,810 --> 02:07:08,950
Are you so- Oh my god!

3223
02:07:09,150 --> 02:07:09,230
Oh my god!

3224
02:07:09,230 --> 02:07:09,650
You know what?

3225
02:07:09,810 --> 02:07:10,350
Alright, stop.

3226
02:07:11,710 --> 02:07:12,170
Angry.

3227
02:07:15,990 --> 02:07:17,350
He tamed it.

3228
02:07:18,430 --> 02:07:20,830
Oh, since there is a limited pull up.

3229
02:07:20,990 --> 02:07:21,550
Oh, I see.

3230
02:07:23,130 --> 02:07:23,590
Angry.

3231
02:07:27,200 --> 02:07:28,560
I don't remember how I play Reaper.

3232
02:07:31,080 --> 02:07:32,560
It's only D.Va, right?

3233
02:07:32,760 --> 02:07:32,980
Okay.

3234
02:07:34,520 --> 02:07:35,940
Not that bad, right?

3235
02:07:36,160 --> 02:07:37,040
It doesn't seem that bad.

3236
02:07:38,400 --> 02:07:39,620
Oh wait, but they capped.

3237
02:07:39,740 --> 02:07:40,300
So I don't know what...

3238
02:07:41,760 --> 02:07:43,280
I shall counter play.

3239
02:07:43,560 --> 02:07:44,100
Alright, guys.

3240
02:07:45,060 --> 02:07:46,500
How's the perks for this?

3241
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:50,840
It's not fair.

3242
02:07:54,220 --> 02:07:55,860
Hey, where's the health packs for this?

3243
02:07:59,500 --> 02:08:00,500
Please heal me.

3244
02:08:03,220 --> 02:08:04,260
Please heal me.

3245
02:08:04,520 --> 02:08:04,540
Please heal me.

3246
02:08:04,540 --> 02:08:05,200
I'm scared.

3247
02:08:08,460 --> 02:08:09,160
Farm him!

3248
02:08:09,260 --> 02:08:10,020
He's an old battery!

3249
02:08:10,260 --> 02:08:10,680
Farm him!

3250
02:08:11,080 --> 02:08:12,120
Keep farming him!

3251
02:08:14,740 --> 02:08:15,820
Keep farming him!

3252
02:08:15,820 --> 02:08:15,840
Keep farming him!

3253
02:08:15,960 --> 02:08:16,760
He's enough- Oh, goodbye.

3254
02:08:18,760 --> 02:08:20,260
I can't shoot that.

3255
02:08:22,180 --> 02:08:23,400
Alright, that's fine.

3256
02:08:23,580 --> 02:08:24,120
Our tank died.

3257
02:08:24,500 --> 02:08:25,920
I really need that.

3258
02:08:26,040 --> 02:08:27,020
No, you don't understand.

3259
02:08:27,020 --> 02:08:27,700
I do.

3260
02:08:29,940 --> 02:08:31,160
Guys, left or right?

3261
02:08:32,520 --> 02:08:33,460
Left or right?

3262
02:08:33,460 --> 02:08:33,660
Right, right.

3263
02:08:33,800 --> 02:08:33,960
Okay.

3264
02:08:37,040 --> 02:08:38,940
I know my main goal with Sif.

3265
02:08:42,540 --> 02:08:43,020
Oh.

3266
02:08:44,620 --> 02:08:45,100
Hello.

3267
02:08:45,440 --> 02:08:46,000
Are you though?

3268
02:08:47,140 --> 02:08:48,220
Oh my gosh, she was.

3269
02:08:51,560 --> 02:08:52,500
Oh my god.

3270
02:08:52,600 --> 02:08:53,060
Oh no.

3271
02:08:53,260 --> 02:08:54,020
I got anti.

3272
02:08:57,020 --> 02:08:59,960
That 8 HP was a huge difference.

3273
02:09:00,520 --> 02:09:01,700
You don't understand.

3274
02:09:04,280 --> 02:09:06,240
I thought he was more of a tank trader.

3275
02:09:06,980 --> 02:09:09,600
To be fair, tanks are like 8,000 HP now.

3276
02:09:11,800 --> 02:09:13,060
I didn't remember.

3277
02:09:14,660 --> 02:09:15,600
This matters.

3278
02:09:16,460 --> 02:09:17,060
Oh, thank you.

3279
02:09:21,540 --> 02:09:22,980
Thank you, Ogg.

3280
02:09:23,180 --> 02:09:24,500
I needed that.

3281
02:09:24,940 --> 02:09:28,700
I... Yippee!

3282
02:09:29,200 --> 02:09:29,380
Oh.

3283
02:09:31,380 --> 02:09:32,660
Was it right?

3284
02:09:33,380 --> 02:09:34,320
Right, right.

3285
02:09:34,720 --> 02:09:36,560
I didn't even read what my perks are.

3286
02:09:38,400 --> 02:09:39,760
I didn't even read it.

3287
02:09:39,880 --> 02:09:43,000
I was just like... Very helpful.

3288
02:09:43,400 --> 02:09:44,520
It really was.

3289
02:09:45,100 --> 02:09:46,540
I appreciate it.

3290
02:09:47,960 --> 02:09:49,220
Where do I go?

3291
02:09:52,100 --> 02:09:55,760
Like... I guess I'll... I'll just shoot him from here.

3292
02:09:59,340 --> 02:10:00,400
Oh my god.

3293
02:10:00,580 --> 02:10:02,140
This hog is crazy though.

3294
02:10:02,720 --> 02:10:03,360
Like, actually.

3295
02:10:04,280 --> 02:10:05,760
This hog is insane.

3296
02:10:08,600 --> 02:10:09,580
Like... Oh my god.

3297
02:10:09,720 --> 02:10:10,620
What is he doing?

3298
02:10:10,740 --> 02:10:11,640
These hooks are crazy.

3299
02:10:19,280 --> 02:10:20,420
You know what's funny?

3300
02:10:20,660 --> 02:10:21,520
Their Ana didn't care.

3301
02:10:25,600 --> 02:10:26,640
Oh my god.

3302
02:10:26,980 --> 02:10:27,700
Oh my god.

3303
02:10:27,880 --> 02:10:28,540
I... What?

3304
02:10:28,720 --> 02:10:30,000
What happened to me?

3305
02:10:32,120 --> 02:10:33,740
What happened to me?

3306
02:10:35,140 --> 02:10:36,980
I got like everything off.

3307
02:10:37,080 --> 02:10:37,480
It's okay.

3308
02:10:37,480 --> 02:10:37,560
Okay.

3309
02:10:37,560 --> 02:10:38,460
My team did it.

3310
02:10:39,020 --> 02:10:39,900
My team did it.

3311
02:10:41,460 --> 02:10:42,960
Oh, she got...

3312
02:10:42,960 --> 02:10:44,660
Ana took that firstly.

3313
02:10:45,160 --> 02:10:47,840
I mean, their Ana let their Hanzo die.

3314
02:10:48,220 --> 02:10:49,580
Like, I... I don't know.

3315
02:10:50,360 --> 02:10:53,000
I'm just speaking facts there.

3316
02:10:53,360 --> 02:10:56,140
And then this Mercy just gracefully glided.

3317
02:10:58,080 --> 02:11:01,040
This Mercy just gracefully glided like that.

3318
02:11:01,280 --> 02:11:02,900
Like, I don't know what he was doing.

3319
02:11:06,080 --> 02:11:06,760
Alright.

3320
02:11:06,960 --> 02:11:07,320
Oh, no.

3321
02:11:07,600 --> 02:11:09,380
Goddamn stupid Hanzo.

3322
02:11:11,020 --> 02:11:11,980
I'm leaving.

3323
02:11:15,040 --> 02:11:15,720
Hello.

3324
02:11:16,100 --> 02:11:16,700
Hello, guys.

3325
02:11:18,520 --> 02:11:20,280
Let me be behind your shield.

3326
02:11:22,620 --> 02:11:23,300
Oh.

3327
02:11:23,640 --> 02:11:24,460
It's okay.

3328
02:11:25,420 --> 02:11:26,700
It's okay, guys.

3329
02:11:28,360 --> 02:11:29,600
I'm right here.

3330
02:11:29,820 --> 02:11:30,680
It's okay, guys.

3331
02:11:33,580 --> 02:11:34,780
Oh, thank you.

3332
02:11:35,040 --> 02:11:35,360
Jump rat.

3333
02:11:35,680 --> 02:11:36,680
Oh, goodbye.

3334
02:11:39,380 --> 02:11:40,080
No.

3335
02:11:40,460 --> 02:11:42,040
He put me so far.

3336
02:11:46,120 --> 02:11:47,260
So far.

3337
02:11:47,680 --> 02:11:47,780
Oh.

3338
02:11:49,760 --> 02:11:52,160
That's unlucky for him.

3339
02:11:54,120 --> 02:11:55,040
It's okay.

3340
02:11:55,420 --> 02:11:58,640
This is always the strat when we're about to push point.

3341
02:12:01,660 --> 02:12:02,660
Overtime strat.

3342
02:12:14,740 --> 02:12:16,640
I told you.

3343
02:12:16,860 --> 02:12:17,780
The overtime strat.

3344
02:12:17,980 --> 02:12:19,280
It always works.

3345
02:12:19,920 --> 02:12:21,700
Overtime strat always works.

3346
02:12:22,580 --> 02:12:24,560
The good old Bastion.

3347
02:12:24,640 --> 02:12:28,760
The good old Bastion strat at the very end.

3348
02:12:29,300 --> 02:12:29,560
The...

3349
02:12:32,500 --> 02:12:33,340
Yippee.

3350
02:12:33,340 --> 02:12:36,480
Oh, that's when I swapped the Bastion.

3351
02:12:36,760 --> 02:12:37,800
Let's go.

3352
02:12:41,240 --> 02:12:41,900
Yippee.

3353
02:12:44,810 --> 02:12:45,740
Overtime strat.

3354
02:12:48,840 --> 02:12:52,020
All my homies hate surprise Bastion.

3355
02:12:52,660 --> 02:12:52,880
All right.

3356
02:12:53,600 --> 02:12:54,040
It's time.

3357
02:12:55,200 --> 02:12:55,500
All right.

3358
02:12:56,440 --> 02:12:56,840
Stadium.

3359
02:12:58,160 --> 02:12:58,600
Oh, yeah.

3360
02:12:58,800 --> 02:13:01,020
So, by the way, there is, like, rank, by the way, for this.

3361
02:13:01,180 --> 02:13:01,900
I remember telling...

3362
02:13:01,900 --> 02:13:02,100
Wait.

3363
02:13:02,700 --> 02:13:03,040
Change.

3364
02:13:03,360 --> 02:13:03,540
Okay.

3365
02:13:03,720 --> 02:13:04,140
Stadium.

3366
02:13:04,380 --> 02:13:04,860
Roll Q.

3367
02:13:05,480 --> 02:13:07,240
I am basically a baby.

3368
02:13:07,420 --> 02:13:08,580
We're not doing damage.

3369
02:13:09,200 --> 02:13:10,720
I don't trust myself.

3370
02:13:11,400 --> 02:13:15,780
So, the stadium is the newest thing that they added to Overwatch 2.

3371
02:13:16,600 --> 02:13:17,080
And...

3372
02:13:18,280 --> 02:13:19,380
They have, like...

3373
02:13:19,380 --> 02:13:20,620
It's, like, a whole new different mode.

3374
02:13:20,640 --> 02:13:22,900
And they have their own ranking system for it, too.

3375
02:13:23,040 --> 02:13:25,760
So, you can get competitive points and everything in the stadium.

3376
02:13:26,840 --> 02:13:27,320
And...

3377
02:13:27,320 --> 02:13:28,320
Oh, these are all the characters.

3378
02:13:28,480 --> 02:13:29,020
All right, guys.

3379
02:13:29,340 --> 02:13:29,900
The Juno.

3380
02:13:29,900 --> 02:13:31,140
Oh, my God.

3381
02:13:31,900 --> 02:13:33,200
Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

3382
02:13:33,840 --> 02:13:34,320
Guys.

3383
02:13:34,580 --> 02:13:34,900
Okay.

3384
02:13:35,440 --> 02:13:36,840
What do I get?

3385
02:13:37,360 --> 02:13:38,480
Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho.

3386
02:13:39,440 --> 02:13:39,840
Okay.

3387
02:13:40,160 --> 02:13:40,920
This is a lot.

3388
02:13:41,300 --> 02:13:42,000
Oh, ho, ho.

3389
02:13:42,380 --> 02:13:43,140
All right, guys.

3390
02:13:43,380 --> 02:13:45,460
So, what is the torpedo build?

3391
02:13:45,820 --> 02:13:46,880
What is...

3392
02:13:47,500 --> 02:13:48,660
Basically, this build.

3393
02:13:48,760 --> 02:13:49,440
Is it this build?

3394
02:13:49,900 --> 02:13:51,320
Do I just get all of these?

3395
02:13:51,740 --> 02:13:52,180
All right.

3396
02:13:52,300 --> 02:13:53,960
Gains one additional charge.

3397
02:13:54,340 --> 02:13:55,060
Heal for...

3398
02:13:56,160 --> 02:13:57,460
Missiles and AP.

3399
02:13:59,180 --> 02:14:00,980
So, I just do this build.

3400
02:14:02,260 --> 02:14:03,920
This is where the fun...

3401
02:14:03,920 --> 02:14:07,160
Just get everything that says torpedo and ability power.

3402
02:14:07,520 --> 02:14:09,020
So, all of these?

3403
02:14:09,900 --> 02:14:10,520
Torpedo.

3404
02:14:10,920 --> 02:14:11,400
All of...

3405
02:14:11,400 --> 02:14:12,240
Oh, my God.

3406
02:14:12,340 --> 02:14:12,500
Wait.

3407
02:14:12,660 --> 02:14:12,820
Okay.

3408
02:14:12,980 --> 02:14:13,340
Power.

3409
02:14:15,700 --> 02:14:16,320
Torpedo.

3410
02:14:16,760 --> 02:14:17,020
Okay.

3411
02:14:17,360 --> 02:14:19,260
Pull up the spreadsheet.

3412
02:14:19,880 --> 02:14:20,420
Okay.

3413
02:14:20,780 --> 02:14:23,300
Guys, you gotta teach me what build to get, guys.

3414
02:14:23,460 --> 02:14:24,920
You gotta teach me.

3415
02:14:26,820 --> 02:14:27,700
There's so...

3416
02:14:27,700 --> 02:14:27,920
Okay.

3417
02:14:28,140 --> 02:14:31,020
So, I get all the abilities here.

3418
02:14:31,220 --> 02:14:31,340
Okay.

3419
02:14:31,480 --> 02:14:32,540
Where is torpedo?

3420
02:14:33,860 --> 02:14:35,380
You can get, like, four...

3421
02:14:35,380 --> 02:14:35,600
Okay.

3422
02:14:35,740 --> 02:14:37,960
But, like, what is the torpedo build?

3423
02:14:41,040 --> 02:14:42,300
How do I do it?

3424
02:14:43,780 --> 02:14:45,100
I'm queuing up, guys.

3425
02:14:45,220 --> 02:14:46,120
I'm just practicing.

3426
02:14:46,140 --> 02:14:47,560
I gotta practice my build.

3427
02:14:47,780 --> 02:14:48,740
What do we build first?

3428
02:14:50,180 --> 02:14:51,380
This will do me fine?

3429
02:14:51,560 --> 02:14:51,800
Okay.

3430
02:14:52,760 --> 02:14:53,100
Oh.

3431
02:14:55,120 --> 02:14:56,180
Oh, I got a game.

3432
02:14:56,320 --> 02:14:56,800
I was like, what?

3433
02:15:00,880 --> 02:15:02,220
I got concerned.

3434
02:15:02,540 --> 02:15:04,740
I was like, what happened?

3435
02:15:07,760 --> 02:15:09,820
Time to do it live, I guess.

3436
02:15:11,780 --> 02:15:13,560
Time to figure this out live.

3437
02:15:17,880 --> 02:15:20,200
Yeah, this is my first stadium game, by the way.

3438
02:15:20,620 --> 02:15:21,820
My very first one.

3439
02:15:25,970 --> 02:15:27,970
I almost picked the wrong support, too.

3440
02:15:28,130 --> 02:15:29,950
Because I'm so used to double clicking.

3441
02:15:33,870 --> 02:15:34,330
Okay.

3442
02:15:35,750 --> 02:15:36,490
I'm ready.

3443
02:15:40,180 --> 02:15:41,420
No think only.

3444
02:15:41,660 --> 02:15:41,840
Guys.

3445
02:15:42,120 --> 02:15:42,600
Guys.

3446
02:15:42,760 --> 02:15:43,900
I looked at...

3447
02:15:43,900 --> 02:15:46,360
I looked at the stuff I have to do, guys.

3448
02:15:46,520 --> 02:15:50,720
And I don't know if no think only do is applicable for stadium.

3449
02:15:51,480 --> 02:15:51,960
I...

3450
02:15:56,540 --> 02:15:58,460
With the amount...

3451
02:15:58,760 --> 02:15:59,560
Power up your build.

3452
02:15:59,740 --> 02:16:01,600
Choose from two example builds to get started.

3453
02:16:01,760 --> 02:16:02,700
Explore all the options.

3454
02:16:03,180 --> 02:16:04,600
Customize, sell, and count it.

3455
02:16:04,720 --> 02:16:06,480
React and adapt to your enemy.

3456
02:16:06,640 --> 02:16:08,800
So it's like, basically a MOBA and a healer shooter.

3457
02:16:09,540 --> 02:16:09,940
So...

3458
02:16:09,940 --> 02:16:10,320
Alright.

3459
02:16:10,700 --> 02:16:12,880
So, is it okay if I start with Power Pulse?

3460
02:16:12,880 --> 02:16:14,680
Or do I do it with anything else?

3461
02:16:16,140 --> 02:16:16,860
Reforcing it.

3462
02:16:17,220 --> 02:16:17,460
Guys.

3463
02:16:17,680 --> 02:16:17,840
Guys.

3464
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:18,360
I don't know.

3465
02:16:18,740 --> 02:16:19,120
I...

3466
02:16:20,780 --> 02:16:21,260
Alright.

3467
02:16:21,780 --> 02:16:23,500
And then I'll do...

3468
02:16:23,500 --> 02:16:24,440
This.

3469
02:16:24,780 --> 02:16:26,340
What if I just build everything right now?

3470
02:16:28,120 --> 02:16:29,500
I'll just do all of this.

3471
02:16:29,660 --> 02:16:30,660
And I can sell this.

3472
02:16:30,760 --> 02:16:31,480
And then do that.

3473
02:16:31,920 --> 02:16:32,280
Right?

3474
02:16:32,380 --> 02:16:33,160
I have enough.

3475
02:16:33,340 --> 02:16:33,520
Okay.

3476
02:16:34,620 --> 02:16:35,100
Whoa.

3477
02:16:37,480 --> 02:16:37,960
Alright.

3478
02:16:39,020 --> 02:16:41,900
Just click torpedo and AP.

3479
02:16:41,900 --> 02:16:42,620
Eat.

3480
02:16:44,600 --> 02:16:45,040
Alright.

3481
02:16:45,060 --> 02:16:45,820
I can do this.

3482
02:16:46,720 --> 02:16:47,640
We got this.

3483
02:16:48,280 --> 02:16:49,200
I believe, guys.

3484
02:16:49,440 --> 02:16:50,360
It's torpedo time.

3485
02:16:53,940 --> 02:16:54,380
Alright.

3486
02:16:54,700 --> 02:16:55,900
I think I got it.

3487
02:16:56,720 --> 02:16:57,140
Wait.

3488
02:16:57,300 --> 02:16:58,920
Can't you change it to...

3489
02:16:58,920 --> 02:16:59,100
Wait.

3490
02:16:59,260 --> 02:17:00,560
Can't you change it to the first person?

3491
02:17:01,040 --> 02:17:02,000
I thought you can...

3492
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:02,180
Yeah.

3493
02:17:02,920 --> 02:17:03,080
Alright.

3494
02:17:03,140 --> 02:17:03,600
Let's try...

3495
02:17:03,600 --> 02:17:04,520
Let's try third person.

3496
02:17:06,080 --> 02:17:07,240
Let's try third person.

3497
02:17:07,560 --> 02:17:07,740
Whoa.

3498
02:17:08,180 --> 02:17:08,420
Oh.

3499
02:17:08,580 --> 02:17:10,300
There's a reason why we try third person.

3500
02:17:29,160 --> 02:17:36,480
I don't know what the elo is for this one.

3501
02:17:36,480 --> 02:17:38,180
Because I don't have a rank.

3502
02:17:40,560 --> 02:17:42,240
I don't have a rank for this one.

3503
02:17:42,580 --> 02:17:43,140
Where do we have to go?

3504
02:17:43,700 --> 02:17:43,980
Oh.

3505
02:17:44,140 --> 02:17:45,280
It's a new map, too.

3506
02:17:50,860 --> 02:17:51,300
Oh.

3507
02:17:51,400 --> 02:17:53,020
It's so weird watching this in.

3508
02:17:55,100 --> 02:17:56,940
It's so weird watching this in.

3509
02:17:59,460 --> 02:18:00,060
Okay.

3510
02:18:00,160 --> 02:18:00,260
Okay.

3511
02:18:00,260 --> 02:18:01,120
My team's dead already?

3512
02:18:01,320 --> 02:18:01,460
Alright.

3513
02:18:04,720 --> 02:18:05,580
That's cool.

3514
02:18:07,940 --> 02:18:08,760
That's cool.

3515
02:18:15,060 --> 02:18:17,960
I think I understand what elo I'm in.

3516
02:18:23,420 --> 02:18:24,560
Get out of here.

3517
02:18:24,960 --> 02:18:25,960
I'm better.

3518
02:18:27,620 --> 02:18:28,260
I

3519
02:18:31,640 --> 02:18:33,640
get my torpedo so fast.

3520
02:18:34,440 --> 02:18:35,540
I just...

3521
02:18:35,540 --> 02:18:35,920
Guys.

3522
02:18:36,240 --> 02:18:36,680
I...

3523
02:18:36,680 --> 02:18:37,340
This is...

3524
02:18:37,340 --> 02:18:38,260
This is not fair.

3525
02:18:44,090 --> 02:18:46,230
I just realized how fast I get it.

3526
02:18:49,270 --> 02:18:49,890
Okay.

3527
02:18:51,730 --> 02:18:52,730
Oh, shit.

3528
02:18:55,530 --> 02:18:56,150
Okay.

3529
02:18:56,430 --> 02:18:56,810
That's fine.

3530
02:19:11,840 --> 02:19:13,280
I build ults so slow, though.

3531
02:19:13,380 --> 02:19:14,420
That's what I don't like right now.

3532
02:19:15,900 --> 02:19:17,020
When do I start...

3533
02:19:17,020 --> 02:19:17,840
When can I buy stuff?

3534
02:19:18,540 --> 02:19:19,100
Get out of here.

3535
02:19:19,320 --> 02:19:20,200
Get out of here, team!

3536
02:19:24,820 --> 02:19:25,860
But, like, when can I...

3537
02:19:25,860 --> 02:19:28,140
Can I upgrade my build when...

3538
02:19:28,140 --> 02:19:28,500
Uh...

3539
02:19:28,500 --> 02:19:30,280
In between rounds or...

3540
02:19:30,280 --> 02:19:31,020
Oh, wait.

3541
02:19:31,200 --> 02:19:31,340
Whoops.

3542
02:19:31,940 --> 02:19:32,280
Can I...

3543
02:19:32,280 --> 02:19:35,380
Do I upgrade my build in between rounds or can I do it when I die?

3544
02:19:38,840 --> 02:19:39,660
I'll keep him up.

3545
02:19:39,760 --> 02:19:40,280
I'll keep him up.

3546
02:19:41,600 --> 02:19:41,960
Mercy.

3547
02:19:42,220 --> 02:19:42,580
I...

3548
02:19:42,580 --> 02:19:43,500
Oh, my God.

3549
02:19:44,320 --> 02:19:44,680
Okay.

3550
02:19:44,760 --> 02:19:46,640
This is, like, the only way to keep us alive right now.

3551
02:19:49,520 --> 02:19:50,220
Oh, no.

3552
02:19:50,500 --> 02:19:50,700
No!

3553
02:19:50,800 --> 02:19:51,560
I couldn't do anything!

3554
02:19:51,740 --> 02:19:52,940
My ult got one down!

3555
02:19:53,200 --> 02:19:53,740
And our rounds.

3556
02:19:53,900 --> 02:19:54,080
Okay.

3557
02:19:54,200 --> 02:19:54,800
And our rounds.

3558
02:19:55,000 --> 02:19:55,760
I just have every...

3559
02:19:57,980 --> 02:19:58,480
Okay.

3560
02:19:58,500 --> 02:19:58,840
Okay.

3561
02:20:00,160 --> 02:20:01,140
That's good to know.

3562
02:20:02,260 --> 02:20:03,460
Get over here, Mercy.

3563
02:20:07,480 --> 02:20:08,200
Don't worry!

3564
02:20:08,920 --> 02:20:09,640
Oh, never mind.

3565
02:20:09,720 --> 02:20:10,020
Worry!

3566
02:20:11,640 --> 02:20:12,500
Mercy, how?

3567
02:20:14,780 --> 02:20:15,280
How?

3568
02:20:18,740 --> 02:20:19,240
Please!

3569
02:20:19,440 --> 02:20:20,400
I have one dead!

3570
02:20:24,330 --> 02:20:28,090
I don't know if I have one playing third person or a first person yet.

3571
02:20:28,410 --> 02:20:29,750
It is, like, different.

3572
02:20:29,750 --> 02:20:30,450
So...

3573
02:20:33,110 --> 02:20:33,970
Okay, nice.

3574
02:20:34,290 --> 02:20:35,830
The speed with the Reaper ult.

3575
02:20:36,970 --> 02:20:37,310
You're there?

3576
02:20:39,050 --> 02:20:39,910
That's not good?

3577
02:20:41,990 --> 02:20:42,790
There you go.

3578
02:20:45,230 --> 02:20:45,750
Nice.

3579
02:20:48,650 --> 02:20:50,070
I didn't know when to crouch.

3580
02:20:56,070 --> 02:20:57,630
I'm trying to do as much as I can.

3581
02:20:59,310 --> 02:20:59,710
Okay.

3582
02:20:59,830 --> 02:21:02,090
I'm about to, like, get as much damage as our Reaper.

3583
02:21:02,310 --> 02:21:04,070
So I know our Reaper is not doing shit.

3584
02:21:07,350 --> 02:21:10,390
But I might not also not be healing very well.

3585
02:21:10,810 --> 02:21:11,290
No, I am.

3586
02:21:11,410 --> 02:21:11,650
I'm healing.

3587
02:21:11,650 --> 02:21:12,310
Wait, no.

3588
02:21:12,990 --> 02:21:14,830
No, I'm healing more than our Mercy.

3589
02:21:15,010 --> 02:21:15,690
Mercy, what?

3590
02:21:15,850 --> 02:21:16,790
I'm healing more than you?

3591
02:21:17,570 --> 02:21:18,010
Mercy!

3592
02:21:21,910 --> 02:21:22,790
Go fast.

3593
02:21:26,810 --> 02:21:27,610
Oh, no.

3594
02:21:27,970 --> 02:21:28,570
That's not good.

3595
02:21:32,660 --> 02:21:33,980
No, I can't do anything!

3596
02:21:37,340 --> 02:21:38,100
Mercy!

3597
02:21:38,480 --> 02:21:39,120
Mercy!

3598
02:21:40,340 --> 02:21:41,860
He just...

3599
02:21:41,860 --> 02:21:43,940
He was at the left click, Mercy!

3600
02:21:46,260 --> 02:21:49,080
Guys, I understand hero bans now.

3601
02:21:49,520 --> 02:21:49,940
I...

3602
02:21:53,820 --> 02:21:55,400
Guys, I understand.

3603
02:21:58,840 --> 02:22:01,360
All I'm saying, I should not be...

3604
02:22:01,360 --> 02:22:02,080
I...

3605
02:22:02,080 --> 02:22:02,860
I don't know.

3606
02:22:05,720 --> 02:22:06,800
Now I know.

3607
02:22:07,620 --> 02:22:09,040
How many rounds is it, too?

3608
02:22:10,220 --> 02:22:11,020
Oh, seven!

3609
02:22:11,260 --> 02:22:11,680
It's seven.

3610
02:22:12,900 --> 02:22:13,200
Okay.

3611
02:22:13,540 --> 02:22:13,820
Let's see.

3612
02:22:13,840 --> 02:22:14,400
It's late game.

3613
02:22:14,400 --> 02:22:14,940
That's better.

3614
02:22:15,700 --> 02:22:16,240
All right.

3615
02:22:16,500 --> 02:22:18,320
And then all I have to do is...

3616
02:22:18,320 --> 02:22:19,300
Do I buy all of these?

3617
02:22:21,440 --> 02:22:23,280
No, it's seven, apparently, right?

3618
02:22:25,040 --> 02:22:26,880
Just buy all of these and it's okay?

3619
02:22:28,840 --> 02:22:29,280
Yeah?

3620
02:22:29,680 --> 02:22:29,920
All right.

3621
02:22:31,160 --> 02:22:32,080
Let me revoid this.

3622
02:22:32,180 --> 02:22:32,860
10% ability...

3623
02:22:32,860 --> 02:22:33,900
Oh, I have lifesteal.

3624
02:22:34,380 --> 02:22:36,020
Gain over health ability.

3625
02:22:36,440 --> 02:22:36,880
20%.

3626
02:22:37,520 --> 02:22:37,960
Oh.

3627
02:22:38,520 --> 02:22:39,880
I don't have enough money for this.

3628
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:40,260
I'm broke.

3629
02:22:44,320 --> 02:22:46,420
Wait, should I get this one over the other?

3630
02:22:52,950 --> 02:22:53,390
Uh...

3631
02:22:53,390 --> 02:22:55,090
Oh, I'll just keep this.

3632
02:22:58,190 --> 02:23:00,210
I'll build power goes healing and damage.

3633
02:23:01,430 --> 02:23:02,990
How do I go back to my store?

3634
02:23:03,130 --> 02:23:03,730
Oh, here.

3635
02:23:04,890 --> 02:23:07,150
Oh, how do I go back to my armory, though?

3636
02:23:08,070 --> 02:23:08,850
Oh, H.

3637
02:23:08,970 --> 02:23:09,210
Okay.

3638
02:23:11,430 --> 02:23:11,850
Um...

3639
02:23:12,630 --> 02:23:14,170
I'll do this first, then.

3640
02:23:15,270 --> 02:23:16,590
If I can sell the greens?

3641
02:23:16,850 --> 02:23:17,650
Okay, I'll sell...

3642
02:23:17,650 --> 02:23:19,870
I'll do that next round and sell the greens.

3643
02:23:23,070 --> 02:23:25,350
I'm just following the example builds they give me.

3644
02:23:25,350 --> 02:23:27,610
I can see why there's, like, a lot you can do.

3645
02:23:27,810 --> 02:23:28,950
Refurb, thank you for Twitch Prime.

3646
02:23:29,050 --> 02:23:29,690
Thank you, thank you.

3647
02:23:29,810 --> 02:23:30,170
Search up.

3648
02:23:30,290 --> 02:23:31,530
Thank you for the thousand biddies.

3649
02:23:31,710 --> 02:23:32,450
Thank you, thank you.

3650
02:23:33,150 --> 02:23:33,510
Boom.

3651
02:23:34,550 --> 02:23:34,790
All right.

3652
02:23:34,830 --> 02:23:35,950
How strong am I now?

3653
02:23:36,890 --> 02:23:37,950
I believe, like...

3654
02:23:37,950 --> 02:23:39,190
This is all rank, right?

3655
02:23:39,330 --> 02:23:41,130
There's no actual quick play for Stadia.

3656
02:23:47,660 --> 02:23:48,620
I'll put that in.

3657
02:23:49,480 --> 02:23:52,000
Okay, so Mercy is only good when...

3658
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:53,000
Very late build.

3659
02:23:54,140 --> 02:23:55,260
I now know that.

3660
02:23:56,580 --> 02:23:57,100
Okay.

3661
02:24:01,020 --> 02:24:01,980
Don't worry, Mercy.

3662
02:24:02,060 --> 02:24:02,600
I got you.

3663
02:24:03,100 --> 02:24:04,220
Okay, you got...

3664
02:24:04,220 --> 02:24:05,420
I still got you.

3665
02:24:05,520 --> 02:24:06,440
I have to reload, though.

3666
02:24:09,820 --> 02:24:10,620
Don't worry.

3667
02:24:10,760 --> 02:24:11,400
I'm helping.

3668
02:24:12,540 --> 02:24:13,300
Look at that.

3669
02:24:13,300 --> 02:24:13,820
I helped.

3670
02:24:14,860 --> 02:24:15,700
I helped.

3671
02:24:16,600 --> 02:24:19,340
I have no idea what my ELO is, because I have never...

3672
02:24:19,340 --> 02:24:21,180
I've never played Stadia before.

3673
02:24:22,500 --> 02:24:23,580
But, like...

3674
02:24:23,580 --> 02:24:25,320
This is, like, spreadsheet worthy.

3675
02:24:26,700 --> 02:24:27,240
Like...

3676
02:24:29,320 --> 02:24:30,400
I'm, like...

3677
02:24:30,400 --> 02:24:33,460
Like, this is definitely, like, stuff you need a spreadsheet for.

3678
02:24:39,490 --> 02:24:40,030
Okay.

3679
02:24:42,310 --> 02:24:43,170
Oh, my God.

3680
02:24:43,250 --> 02:24:44,470
What are you doing, Reaper?

3681
02:24:44,970 --> 02:24:46,010
What are you...

3682
02:24:46,010 --> 02:24:46,970
Oh, my God.

3683
02:24:47,110 --> 02:24:47,390
Reaper!

3684
02:24:48,670 --> 02:24:49,790
Oh, my God.

3685
02:24:49,850 --> 02:24:50,110
Reaper!

3686
02:24:50,670 --> 02:24:51,430
There's something!

3687
02:24:52,130 --> 02:24:52,790
Reaper everywhere!

3688
02:24:57,170 --> 02:24:57,770
Okay.

3689
02:25:01,640 --> 02:25:02,240
Okay.

3690
02:25:02,820 --> 02:25:04,540
I need to, like...

3691
02:25:04,540 --> 02:25:06,320
Oh, that Arborist is good, though.

3692
02:25:07,560 --> 02:25:08,400
There you go.

3693
02:25:08,560 --> 02:25:08,960
We fight this.

3694
02:25:09,020 --> 02:25:09,500
We fight this.

3695
02:25:09,880 --> 02:25:10,400
What?

3696
02:25:10,880 --> 02:25:13,160
That out-damages my ult?

3697
02:25:19,910 --> 02:25:22,230
It out-damages my ult?

3698
02:25:22,370 --> 02:25:23,130
My ult?

3699
02:25:24,830 --> 02:25:25,430
It...

3700
02:25:25,430 --> 02:25:26,210
Oh, my God.

3701
02:25:26,490 --> 02:25:26,990
That strength.

3702
02:25:30,010 --> 02:25:31,330
I did use it.

3703
02:25:36,630 --> 02:25:37,230
Unless...

3704
02:25:37,230 --> 02:25:38,070
I don't have speed boost.

3705
02:25:38,310 --> 02:25:38,770
Good luck.

3706
02:25:39,610 --> 02:25:40,670
Good luck.

3707
02:25:41,270 --> 02:25:43,250
Good luck.

3708
02:25:45,920 --> 02:25:46,580
Okay.

3709
02:25:48,760 --> 02:25:52,240
I can't believe it, like, actually out-damages...

3710
02:25:53,780 --> 02:25:56,800
Out-damages my own, like, healing ult.

3711
02:26:01,060 --> 02:26:02,460
Guys, use this to...

3712
02:26:02,460 --> 02:26:02,800
Oh, okay.

3713
02:26:02,980 --> 02:26:04,160
Or to go forward.

3714
02:26:04,960 --> 02:26:06,360
That is a...

3715
02:26:06,360 --> 02:26:07,920
That is truly a decision.

3716
02:26:14,150 --> 02:26:14,750
Okay.

3717
02:26:17,870 --> 02:26:18,470
Nice.

3718
02:26:21,650 --> 02:26:23,470
I still don't know which...

3719
02:26:23,470 --> 02:26:23,950
I should try...

3720
02:26:23,950 --> 02:26:25,530
I'm gonna try first person after this round.

3721
02:26:28,050 --> 02:26:28,650
Nice.

3722
02:26:30,210 --> 02:26:31,290
Oh, it's overtime.

3723
02:26:33,890 --> 02:26:34,910
Oh, it's one.

3724
02:26:35,290 --> 02:26:35,810
Nice.

3725
02:26:37,590 --> 02:26:38,750
We did it!

3726
02:26:40,230 --> 02:26:41,530
Orsa, no, thank.

3727
02:26:41,790 --> 02:26:42,590
Only one.

3728
02:26:44,290 --> 02:26:44,770
Nice.

3729
02:26:48,430 --> 02:26:48,950
Okay.

3730
02:26:48,950 --> 02:26:49,510
I have...

3731
02:26:50,350 --> 02:26:51,010
Let's see.

3732
02:26:51,170 --> 02:26:51,310
Okay.

3733
02:26:51,370 --> 02:26:52,010
I'm doing less damage.

3734
02:26:52,010 --> 02:26:54,070
I'm actually focusing on healing now, guys.

3735
02:26:54,070 --> 02:26:55,070
Look at that.

3736
02:26:57,010 --> 02:26:57,950
Look at that.

3737
02:26:57,950 --> 02:27:00,250
I'm focused on healing now, guys.

3738
02:27:00,510 --> 02:27:01,330
I did it.

3739
02:27:02,310 --> 02:27:03,630
Okay, Mr. Tiny Man.

3740
02:27:03,630 --> 02:27:05,250
You have the lowest damp.

3741
02:27:07,890 --> 02:27:08,530
Shush.

3742
02:27:10,190 --> 02:27:12,830
You are not doing anything right now.

3743
02:27:13,430 --> 02:27:14,070
Shush.

3744
02:27:17,310 --> 02:27:18,090
All right.

3745
02:27:18,210 --> 02:27:18,870
Do we sell?

3746
02:27:19,590 --> 02:27:20,490
We should sell.

3747
02:27:20,710 --> 02:27:20,830
Okay.

3748
02:27:21,370 --> 02:27:22,690
10% lifesteal.

3749
02:27:23,750 --> 02:27:24,390
Ability.

3750
02:27:24,610 --> 02:27:24,830
Power.

3751
02:27:25,090 --> 02:27:25,430
Ability.

3752
02:27:25,590 --> 02:27:26,230
Lifesteal.

3753
02:27:27,070 --> 02:27:28,110
We have enough?

3754
02:27:28,490 --> 02:27:29,110
7,000.

3755
02:27:29,410 --> 02:27:31,130
If I sell this, 8,000.

3756
02:27:31,450 --> 02:27:31,990
9,000.

3757
02:27:32,270 --> 02:27:32,410
10.

3758
02:27:32,730 --> 02:27:35,170
If I sell all three of this to get this, is it worth it?

3759
02:27:38,240 --> 02:27:39,560
I'll do it.

3760
02:27:40,580 --> 02:27:41,580
I'll do it.

3761
02:27:48,420 --> 02:27:49,340
Shush, Reaper.

3762
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:51,020
Look at...

3763
02:27:51,020 --> 02:27:53,520
I know what your damage was.

3764
02:27:53,680 --> 02:27:56,520
You've already seen so much action, and there's still more to come.

3765
02:28:00,430 --> 02:28:01,290
This guy.

3766
02:28:01,570 --> 02:28:03,390
Don't make me open your profile.

3767
02:28:03,770 --> 02:28:04,330
Don't...

3768
02:28:06,770 --> 02:28:09,670
Don't make me open your profile, Mr. Tiny Man.

3769
02:28:13,010 --> 02:28:13,570
Don't...

3770
02:28:19,190 --> 02:28:20,870
Don't make me open it.

3771
02:28:22,790 --> 02:28:25,190
I saw your KDA, buddy.

3772
02:28:25,810 --> 02:28:26,290
I...

3773
02:28:26,290 --> 02:28:27,930
Listen here, canvas.

3774
02:28:30,470 --> 02:28:31,150
Canvas.

3775
02:28:33,530 --> 02:28:35,910
3, 2, 1.

3776
02:28:36,290 --> 02:28:36,330
Good.

3777
02:28:37,430 --> 02:28:39,390
Commencing attack on Objective B.

3778
02:28:40,650 --> 02:28:41,590
All right.

3779
02:28:42,150 --> 02:28:42,670
Bite size!

3780
02:28:42,810 --> 02:28:44,330
Thank you for 10 gifted subs!

3781
02:28:44,470 --> 02:28:44,790
Thank you!

3782
02:28:44,930 --> 02:28:45,490
Thank you!

3783
02:28:47,690 --> 02:28:49,030
I really appreciate it.

3784
02:28:49,090 --> 02:28:50,230
Thank you so much!

3785
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:07,480
Okay.

3786
02:29:09,420 --> 02:29:11,100
What the fuck are they doing over there?

3787
02:29:11,720 --> 02:29:12,620
What the fuck?

3788
02:29:13,180 --> 02:29:13,860
What the...

3789
02:29:13,860 --> 02:29:15,280
Oh, no.

3790
02:29:20,500 --> 02:29:21,080
Nice.

3791
02:29:23,960 --> 02:29:24,540
No!

3792
02:29:24,860 --> 02:29:25,520
I got...

3793
02:29:25,520 --> 02:29:25,900
I...

3794
02:29:25,900 --> 02:29:26,720
That was high ego.

3795
02:29:27,160 --> 02:29:27,940
I egoed that.

3796
02:29:28,160 --> 02:29:28,800
God damn it.

3797
02:29:29,660 --> 02:29:31,000
I egoed that.

3798
02:29:31,200 --> 02:29:33,280
I wanted to kill their Mercy so bad.

3799
02:29:34,040 --> 02:29:34,720
Oh, hey.

3800
02:29:34,760 --> 02:29:35,200
I got res.

3801
02:29:35,420 --> 02:29:35,640
Nice.

3802
02:29:36,100 --> 02:29:36,600
Yippee!

3803
02:29:47,090 --> 02:29:47,670
Okay.

3804
02:29:48,090 --> 02:29:48,590
Nice.

3805
02:29:53,320 --> 02:29:53,960
Nice.

3806
02:29:54,240 --> 02:29:54,280
Nice.

3807
02:29:54,280 --> 02:29:54,380
Okay.

3808
02:29:54,420 --> 02:29:56,180
I got focused so much for these.

3809
02:29:56,820 --> 02:29:57,240
No!

3810
02:30:09,990 --> 02:30:10,630
Nice.

3811
02:30:11,090 --> 02:30:12,690
I got focused so much.

3812
02:30:15,670 --> 02:30:16,310
Nice.

3813
02:30:16,630 --> 02:30:16,910
Okay.

3814
02:30:18,530 --> 02:30:19,170
Jesus...

3815
02:30:19,170 --> 02:30:20,210
This is so much.

3816
02:30:20,370 --> 02:30:22,190
There's so much stuff going on.

3817
02:30:22,390 --> 02:30:23,730
Oh, my God.

3818
02:30:24,270 --> 02:30:24,750
I...

3819
02:30:24,750 --> 02:30:27,290
I have to be so focused for this.

3820
02:30:28,290 --> 02:30:30,770
The objective goes live in town.

3821
02:30:37,620 --> 02:30:38,100
Please.

3822
02:30:42,900 --> 02:30:43,380
Okay.

3823
02:30:49,670 --> 02:30:50,490
Oh, my God.

3824
02:30:52,890 --> 02:30:53,850
Jesus Christ.

3825
02:30:59,200 --> 02:30:59,900
Sorry, guys.

3826
02:31:00,040 --> 02:31:02,280
I have to be so focused when I'm playing this game mode.

3827
02:31:02,460 --> 02:31:06,380
It's actually crazy how focused I have to be.

3828
02:31:12,940 --> 02:31:14,100
No!

3829
02:31:14,860 --> 02:31:18,380
Oh, my God.

3830
02:31:19,620 --> 02:31:21,880
I had to do so much.

3831
02:31:22,840 --> 02:31:24,680
I did so much.

3832
02:31:27,880 --> 02:31:28,460
Please.

3833
02:31:35,760 --> 02:31:36,940
Jesus Christ.

3834
02:31:41,410 --> 02:31:41,970
Nice.

3835
02:31:41,970 --> 02:31:42,630
I can't do anything.

3836
02:31:46,570 --> 02:31:47,130
Okay.

3837
02:31:48,590 --> 02:31:51,050
Oh, wait, Cass, what are you doing, Cass?

3838
02:31:51,210 --> 02:31:51,850
Get back here!

3839
02:32:00,030 --> 02:32:00,590
Okay.

3840
02:32:03,030 --> 02:32:03,590
Nice.

3841
02:32:10,260 --> 02:32:11,060
That's bad.

3842
02:32:11,380 --> 02:32:12,500
That's unlucky for us.

3843
02:32:22,320 --> 02:32:24,700
I actually was on high ground.

3844
02:32:24,840 --> 02:32:25,260
What?

3845
02:32:25,480 --> 02:32:26,340
That hits me!

3846
02:32:26,920 --> 02:32:29,080
I flew up too!

3847
02:32:30,040 --> 02:32:32,080
I actually flew up.

3848
02:32:34,380 --> 02:32:36,240
I can't believe it.

3849
02:32:36,500 --> 02:32:37,920
I flew up for that too.

3850
02:32:38,620 --> 02:32:41,640
I flew up for that too.

3851
02:32:41,640 --> 02:32:43,380
Let's check the standings.

3852
02:32:43,580 --> 02:32:45,500
One, two, two.

3853
02:32:46,200 --> 02:32:47,340
Oh my god.

3854
02:32:48,800 --> 02:32:49,360
Damn.

3855
02:32:49,920 --> 02:32:51,940
The range for that.

3856
02:32:52,500 --> 02:32:54,020
True, thank you for the hundred bitties.

3857
02:32:54,140 --> 02:32:54,380
Thank you.

3858
02:32:54,520 --> 02:32:55,000
Thank you.

3859
02:32:56,780 --> 02:33:00,320
All I'm saying is our Reaper is like 3k.

3860
02:33:00,880 --> 02:33:06,080
Like, it's not... It's... That's all I'm saying.

3861
02:33:06,420 --> 02:33:10,840
Our Reaper is at 3k damage.

3862
02:33:10,840 --> 02:33:13,880
And I would... And use that.

3863
02:33:14,480 --> 02:33:18,200
Um... Please use your E ability, Juno.

3864
02:33:18,420 --> 02:33:21,400
Um... Please, like, kill people, Reaper.

3865
02:33:21,980 --> 02:33:26,060
I... Welcome to Stadium.

3866
02:33:28,600 --> 02:33:29,360
Yeah.

3867
02:33:29,620 --> 02:33:32,420
There's a big difference between the two Reapers.

3868
02:33:32,760 --> 02:33:33,520
100%.

3869
02:33:33,520 --> 02:33:35,180
I agree.

3870
02:33:36,120 --> 02:33:39,140
I have the second... Wait, what is... Okay.

3871
02:33:39,320 --> 02:33:40,280
I need to use my money.

3872
02:33:41,520 --> 02:33:42,020
Alright.

3873
02:33:42,020 --> 02:33:43,380
Should I... I should have enough.

3874
02:33:43,560 --> 02:33:45,180
I'll just grab... Ability Power.

3875
02:33:47,820 --> 02:33:49,820
Um... Do your job, Reaper.

3876
02:33:54,240 --> 02:33:54,960
Oh, yeah.

3877
02:33:56,660 --> 02:33:57,580
Try... What was it?

3878
02:33:58,100 --> 02:33:58,600
Options.

3879
02:33:59,860 --> 02:34:00,360
Settings.

3880
02:34:00,860 --> 02:34:01,580
How do I do it?

3881
02:34:03,000 --> 02:34:04,560
Where's first person, guys?

3882
02:34:05,040 --> 02:34:05,520
Stadium.

3883
02:34:05,820 --> 02:34:06,240
Okay.

3884
02:34:06,380 --> 02:34:07,260
Let's try first person.

3885
02:34:07,260 --> 02:34:08,000
I'm curious.

3886
02:34:08,880 --> 02:34:09,100
Oh, my God.

3887
02:34:09,180 --> 02:34:10,440
Everything is so zoomed in now.

3888
02:34:11,660 --> 02:34:12,020
Alright.

3889
02:34:12,280 --> 02:34:13,540
I wanna try this.

3890
02:34:17,630 --> 02:34:18,510
I'm curious.

3891
02:34:22,090 --> 02:34:22,610
Oh!

3892
02:34:23,630 --> 02:34:24,570
What is that?

3893
02:34:24,730 --> 02:34:25,650
Is that the camera?

3894
02:34:33,950 --> 02:34:36,090
Oh, this is... I think... Never mind.

3895
02:34:36,290 --> 02:34:38,450
I get why this third person is good for this.

3896
02:34:39,810 --> 02:34:42,930
I... Guys, I understand why third person is good.

3897
02:34:43,290 --> 02:34:44,410
I understand.

3898
02:34:44,970 --> 02:34:46,050
This is a lie.

3899
02:34:48,650 --> 02:34:49,330
It's...

3900
02:34:50,270 --> 02:34:52,010
It's actually so much.

3901
02:34:56,910 --> 02:34:57,590
Okay.

3902
02:35:03,180 --> 02:35:04,600
What the heck is the Reaper doing?

3903
02:35:05,280 --> 02:35:06,320
What are you...

3904
02:35:10,680 --> 02:35:11,700
What are you...

3905
02:35:11,700 --> 02:35:12,700
What are you doing?

3906
02:35:17,770 --> 02:35:18,790
Oh, my God.

3907
02:35:19,130 --> 02:35:19,950
This is a lie.

3908
02:35:20,150 --> 02:35:21,110
This is actually a lie.

3909
02:35:27,750 --> 02:35:28,870
Jesus Christ.

3910
02:35:31,570 --> 02:35:32,730
Oh, my God.

3911
02:35:33,030 --> 02:35:33,170
Yeah.

3912
02:35:33,390 --> 02:35:34,030
Let me...

3913
02:35:34,930 --> 02:35:35,930
Third person.

3914
02:35:36,190 --> 02:35:37,610
Everything looks a lot slower.

3915
02:35:39,690 --> 02:35:40,810
Third person.

3916
02:35:41,530 --> 02:35:43,450
So much stuff is happening.

3917
02:35:43,730 --> 02:35:44,270
That, like...

3918
02:35:44,270 --> 02:35:44,950
I'm like...

3919
02:35:44,950 --> 02:35:46,010
Oh, my God.

3920
02:35:46,790 --> 02:35:47,350
Wait.

3921
02:35:47,650 --> 02:35:47,790
Wait.

3922
02:35:55,320 --> 02:35:55,840
Okay.

3923
02:36:01,190 --> 02:36:01,710
Okay.

3924
02:36:01,710 --> 02:36:01,930
Here we go.

3925
02:36:05,520 --> 02:36:06,040
Okay.

3926
02:36:06,660 --> 02:36:08,160
I have to use this, too.

3927
02:36:14,200 --> 02:36:14,720
Please.

3928
02:36:16,620 --> 02:36:17,520
I have to reload.

3929
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:21,040
Jesus Christ.

3930
02:36:21,380 --> 02:36:24,380
Everything looks a lot slower, though, when I am third person.

3931
02:36:26,700 --> 02:36:28,240
That's for sure!

3932
02:36:30,280 --> 02:36:31,900
Jesus Christ.

3933
02:36:36,050 --> 02:36:39,210
What is... Reaper, how?

3934
02:36:42,730 --> 02:36:43,650
How?

3935
02:36:48,260 --> 02:36:50,820
Like, we're still fighting!

3936
02:36:53,140 --> 02:36:54,800
Just kill him!

3937
02:36:57,440 --> 02:36:59,520
Okay, no, third person is better.

3938
02:37:00,940 --> 02:37:02,760
Third person is better.

3939
02:37:03,460 --> 02:37:04,260
Oh my god.

3940
02:37:05,520 --> 02:37:11,380
I... I'm just saying, it is very difficult to keep track of what's going on when I'm first person.

3941
02:37:11,960 --> 02:37:14,340
I... I am struggling.

3942
02:37:14,560 --> 02:37:18,520
Like, when I was first person, it was so many things was going on.

3943
02:37:18,900 --> 02:37:21,660
I... Oh no, this is bad.

3944
02:37:22,500 --> 02:37:23,620
This is very bad.

3945
02:37:23,780 --> 02:37:28,680
I needed... I needed... Oh, this is bad for my Mercy.

3946
02:37:30,900 --> 02:37:32,000
That's so bad.

3947
02:37:32,460 --> 02:37:34,240
That was such a good ult.

3948
02:37:34,500 --> 02:37:35,540
We had nothing to counter.

3949
02:37:36,540 --> 02:37:38,320
We had nothing to counter that.

3950
02:37:39,740 --> 02:37:40,780
That's unlucky.

3951
02:37:42,640 --> 02:37:43,960
Oh my god.

3952
02:37:44,580 --> 02:37:46,220
No, I think their team was just better.

3953
02:37:47,660 --> 02:37:49,640
Their team was actually just better.

3954
02:37:51,760 --> 02:37:53,860
God, your Reaper's killing me.

3955
02:37:53,980 --> 02:37:54,800
He's a fuck.

3956
02:37:55,020 --> 02:37:55,360
Hey!

3957
02:37:56,040 --> 02:37:56,700
That's me!

3958
02:37:57,000 --> 02:37:57,980
I'm MVP!

3959
02:38:02,300 --> 02:38:03,340
I'm... I'm...

3960
02:38:04,060 --> 02:38:04,840
That's me!

3961
02:38:05,980 --> 02:38:08,800
I don't know how I got MVP, but I'll take it.

3962
02:38:09,240 --> 02:38:09,600
I'll...

3963
02:38:12,440 --> 02:38:12,960
Alright.

3964
02:38:13,860 --> 02:38:14,800
Yeah, I'll buy that.

3965
02:38:15,160 --> 02:38:17,900
I don't know how I'm doing it, but I take those.

3966
02:38:18,660 --> 02:38:21,360
Okay, I sold this so I can grab this.

3967
02:38:23,140 --> 02:38:24,520
And then, is that good?

3968
02:38:26,080 --> 02:38:27,360
Should I do anything else?

3969
02:38:31,290 --> 02:38:33,110
I got MVP, guys.

3970
02:38:33,290 --> 02:38:33,970
I got MVP, guys.

3971
02:38:33,970 --> 02:38:35,450
I think my team's bad.

3972
02:38:35,910 --> 02:38:41,210
I... I think... I think... I think maybe my team's bad.

3973
02:38:41,550 --> 02:38:43,030
I like how it's like...

3974
02:38:43,030 --> 02:38:49,850
I like how it's like... But it's wristbands, cause... He's right!

3975
02:38:50,050 --> 02:38:51,490
I looked it up!

3976
02:38:51,810 --> 02:38:56,570
Please have noted that this... Bro, they rulebooked the men!

3977
02:38:56,950 --> 02:38:59,530
He's getting rulebooked right now!

3978
02:39:02,690 --> 02:39:04,030
Oh my god!

3979
02:39:04,550 --> 02:39:04,790
Report!

3980
02:39:04,950 --> 02:39:05,310
Report!

3981
02:39:05,750 --> 02:39:06,010
Report!

3982
02:39:06,530 --> 02:39:06,530
Report!

3983
02:39:08,130 --> 02:39:09,130
Oh my god!

3984
02:39:09,230 --> 02:39:10,410
He's getting rulebooked!

3985
02:39:12,470 --> 02:39:14,070
Hey, I got MVP, though.

3986
02:39:14,190 --> 02:39:14,650
Hey, guys.

3987
02:39:14,830 --> 02:39:16,430
I'm very important, guys.

3988
02:39:17,230 --> 02:39:17,390
Woo!

3989
02:39:17,930 --> 02:39:19,890
Very important person here!

3990
02:39:20,910 --> 02:39:21,910
That's me!

3991
02:39:23,130 --> 02:39:25,430
I'm very important, guys.

3992
02:39:31,110 --> 02:39:33,030
My teammates are struggling.

3993
02:39:35,450 --> 02:39:36,470
Oh my god!

3994
02:39:36,610 --> 02:39:39,470
He's exploiting on stream?!

3995
02:39:39,470 --> 02:39:40,670
That's...

3996
02:39:40,670 --> 02:39:43,930
Most val... Most very important person.

3997
02:39:44,430 --> 02:39:45,930
I keep... I forgot to use this.

3998
02:39:46,050 --> 02:39:46,270
Whoops!

3999
02:39:46,370 --> 02:39:46,610
Sorry!

4000
02:39:51,490 --> 02:39:52,090
Oopsie!

4001
02:39:55,850 --> 02:40:00,070
Oh... I need to use my... I need to do my key... left... the right click a lot better.

4002
02:40:01,750 --> 02:40:03,910
This soldier is just running!

4003
02:40:05,210 --> 02:40:09,690
Like... He's... He's just running!

4004
02:40:10,190 --> 02:40:11,770
I... I don't know!

4005
02:40:13,010 --> 02:40:13,650
Wait.

4006
02:40:13,730 --> 02:40:15,710
How do we let our... Orisa die like that?

4007
02:40:15,870 --> 02:40:17,330
Like... He's not even fighting!

4008
02:40:18,070 --> 02:40:19,770
He's just... Running!

4009
02:40:21,130 --> 02:40:23,650
He is actually just running!

4010
02:40:23,970 --> 02:40:25,770
He's not even fighting!

4011
02:40:27,650 --> 02:40:28,970
He's not even fighting!

4012
02:40:29,050 --> 02:40:32,530
Bro, he's literally... I don't know what the fuck he was doing!

4013
02:40:37,150 --> 02:40:37,570
Okay.

4014
02:40:37,570 --> 02:40:38,310
You run.

4015
02:40:38,690 --> 02:40:40,310
Only one person needs to push it anyway.

4016
02:40:40,490 --> 02:40:41,030
I don't even remember that.

4017
02:40:43,070 --> 02:40:43,930
You're fast now!

4018
02:40:44,110 --> 02:40:44,570
You're fast!

4019
02:40:47,230 --> 02:40:47,650
Go!

4020
02:40:47,790 --> 02:40:48,210
Keep walking!

4021
02:40:50,390 --> 02:40:51,130
Oh my god!

4022
02:40:51,310 --> 02:40:51,850
Stop walking!

4023
02:40:51,990 --> 02:40:52,450
Stop walking!

4024
02:40:52,550 --> 02:40:56,170
Why did you... Stop walking!

4025
02:41:02,810 --> 02:41:03,550
Okay, nice.

4026
02:41:05,530 --> 02:41:06,130
There we go.

4027
02:41:07,410 --> 02:41:08,090
There we go.

4028
02:41:12,620 --> 02:41:13,060
Okay.

4029
02:41:15,660 --> 02:41:16,620
Oh my god.

4030
02:41:16,760 --> 02:41:18,700
I am trying my best to keep him up.

4031
02:41:20,800 --> 02:41:21,800
My god, buddy.

4032
02:41:22,180 --> 02:41:22,640
Here we go.

4033
02:41:23,520 --> 02:41:24,160
Here we go.

4034
02:41:24,280 --> 02:41:25,520
Oh, I'm sorry, buddy.

4035
02:41:25,600 --> 02:41:26,000
I tried.

4036
02:41:29,960 --> 02:41:31,800
I'm trying my best to keep you up, buddy.

4037
02:41:33,460 --> 02:41:36,410
Number one!

4038
02:41:41,610 --> 02:41:42,210
What?

4039
02:41:43,690 --> 02:41:44,290
What?

4040
02:41:44,290 --> 02:41:45,130
He has...

4041
02:41:45,130 --> 02:41:45,650
What?

4042
02:41:45,830 --> 02:41:47,270
He gets another...

4043
02:41:47,270 --> 02:41:50,070
You can build it so you can have two walls?

4044
02:41:50,650 --> 02:41:51,250
Wow!

4045
02:41:51,690 --> 02:41:53,710
When did mom let you have two walls?

4046
02:41:57,150 --> 02:41:58,490
That's crazy!

4047
02:42:02,010 --> 02:42:03,550
Oh my god!

4048
02:42:04,350 --> 02:42:06,510
When did mom let you have two walls?

4049
02:42:07,490 --> 02:42:08,190
Every time?

4050
02:42:08,630 --> 02:42:08,970
Really?

4051
02:42:09,370 --> 02:42:11,230
Oh, so that's the bug!

4052
02:42:12,510 --> 02:42:13,970
Oh, I see.

4053
02:42:14,530 --> 02:42:16,590
I was like, how?

4054
02:42:16,590 --> 02:42:16,610
Wow!

4055
02:42:18,150 --> 02:42:19,010
That's what I'm saying!

4056
02:42:19,090 --> 02:42:21,530
Our soldier doesn't even... Our soldier's inting now!

4057
02:42:22,430 --> 02:42:24,190
He lives forever!

4058
02:42:24,190 --> 02:42:24,330
Forever.

4059
02:42:27,890 --> 02:42:29,710
He just lives forever.

4060
02:42:31,510 --> 02:42:32,370
That's crazy.

4061
02:42:35,970 --> 02:42:40,170
Yeah, but he's using the bug where he can... he doesn't need a TP to ult.

4062
02:42:40,310 --> 02:42:41,310
That's what they're saying.

4063
02:42:42,790 --> 02:42:43,870
That's what they're saying.

4064
02:42:45,490 --> 02:42:49,550
He's doing it so that... and this other soldier is like throwing right now.

4065
02:42:51,050 --> 02:42:52,510
Except for when he does that.

4066
02:42:57,080 --> 02:42:57,720
Okay.

4067
02:42:58,280 --> 02:42:58,840
I don't know.

4068
02:42:58,980 --> 02:43:01,740
I just... you know like when you just don't trust your teammate?

4069
02:43:02,040 --> 02:43:03,200
That's me right now.

4070
02:43:07,840 --> 02:43:08,740
There we go.

4071
02:43:12,680 --> 02:43:13,000
Whoa!

4072
02:43:13,360 --> 02:43:14,220
I'm alive!

4073
02:43:18,750 --> 02:43:20,270
Please kill the soldier!

4074
02:43:20,750 --> 02:43:21,390
Guys!

4075
02:43:24,710 --> 02:43:25,730
Shotgun him!

4076
02:43:27,490 --> 02:43:30,450
It's not that hard to shotgun a soldier.

4077
02:43:31,750 --> 02:43:32,710
Wait, why?

4078
02:43:33,390 --> 02:43:33,750
Why?

4079
02:43:35,350 --> 02:43:35,910
Nice.

4080
02:43:37,430 --> 02:43:39,650
Shotgun... on the soldier.

4081
02:43:43,590 --> 02:43:45,490
I'm MVP again!

4082
02:43:46,550 --> 02:43:48,050
I don't know how.

4083
02:43:48,450 --> 02:43:49,930
I don't know what I'm doing.

4084
02:43:49,970 --> 02:43:51,590
But hey, I take those.

4085
02:43:51,590 --> 02:43:53,070
It's time for Clash!

4086
02:43:53,210 --> 02:43:54,030
How am I getting MVP?

4087
02:43:54,130 --> 02:43:54,910
What am I doing?

4088
02:43:56,490 --> 02:43:59,270
I don't... what am I doing to get MVP?

4089
02:43:59,630 --> 02:44:00,090
I don't know.

4090
02:44:00,230 --> 02:44:00,770
Alright, guys.

4091
02:44:01,570 --> 02:44:03,210
Should I try and buy more better abilities?

4092
02:44:03,610 --> 02:44:04,450
What can I buy?

4093
02:44:04,610 --> 02:44:05,610
What can I replace now?

4094
02:44:06,070 --> 02:44:06,990
Can I replace my blues?

4095
02:44:09,470 --> 02:44:10,770
What is my blues?

4096
02:44:14,300 --> 02:44:15,220
I'm gaming.

4097
02:44:16,260 --> 02:44:17,940
Go to the ability tab.

4098
02:44:18,800 --> 02:44:19,360
Yeah?

4099
02:44:20,360 --> 02:44:21,760
What do I replace on?

4100
02:44:22,880 --> 02:44:23,800
Buy more purples?

4101
02:44:23,940 --> 02:44:24,900
Yeah, but buy what though?

4102
02:44:26,620 --> 02:44:27,720
What do I buy?

4103
02:44:32,780 --> 02:44:34,120
The second blue one?

4104
02:44:34,260 --> 02:44:34,680
This one?

4105
02:44:35,700 --> 02:44:36,240
This one.

4106
02:44:36,460 --> 02:44:37,020
Nanocola.

4107
02:44:38,060 --> 02:44:39,820
Okay, something that's 20%.

4108
02:44:39,820 --> 02:44:40,860
Oh my god!

4109
02:44:41,060 --> 02:44:42,480
40% ability power!

4110
02:44:42,480 --> 02:44:43,120
That's right!

4111
02:44:46,060 --> 02:44:48,960
That says 4... that's more than 20!

4112
02:44:49,680 --> 02:44:50,240
That's...

4113
02:44:51,140 --> 02:44:53,100
That's... that's more than 20!

4114
02:44:57,260 --> 02:44:58,320
I see it.

4115
02:44:58,440 --> 02:44:59,580
I see the vision, guys.

4116
02:44:59,860 --> 02:45:00,400
I see it.

4117
02:45:01,360 --> 02:45:03,320
20 is... 40 is more than 20.

4118
02:45:03,320 --> 02:45:05,000
This is the match point.

4119
02:45:05,080 --> 02:45:07,900
The team needs to pull together to stay in the fight.

4120
02:45:10,400 --> 02:45:11,480
3... 2... 1...

4121
02:45:11,480 --> 02:45:12,280
Why can I get another purple?

4122
02:45:12,420 --> 02:45:12,840
It's too late.

4123
02:45:18,000 --> 02:45:19,320
Alright, it's too late.

4124
02:45:19,420 --> 02:45:20,240
I already did it.

4125
02:45:27,830 --> 02:45:28,990
Oh my god!

4126
02:45:33,290 --> 02:45:33,770
Okay.

4127
02:45:35,930 --> 02:45:36,570
Um...

4128
02:45:36,570 --> 02:45:37,410
That's a lot.

4129
02:45:38,490 --> 02:45:39,770
I'll say it.

4130
02:45:42,450 --> 02:45:43,590
I need reload though.

4131
02:45:46,610 --> 02:45:47,250
Okay.

4132
02:45:50,450 --> 02:45:51,090
No!

4133
02:45:51,690 --> 02:45:52,450
He got me!

4134
02:45:52,770 --> 02:45:53,890
He got the 42!

4135
02:45:55,530 --> 02:45:57,470
I can barely see!

4136
02:45:58,910 --> 02:46:01,850
Okay, now I know my torpedoes can full heal.

4137
02:46:02,770 --> 02:46:04,830
And it does a lot of damage too.

4138
02:46:05,810 --> 02:46:07,130
A little bit...

4139
02:46:07,130 --> 02:46:07,530
Over there.

4140
02:46:11,550 --> 02:46:13,050
Okay, this is bad though.

4141
02:46:18,310 --> 02:46:18,870
Alright.

4142
02:46:20,510 --> 02:46:21,450
Alright, nice.

4143
02:46:24,880 --> 02:46:25,860
Jesus Christ.

4144
02:46:28,780 --> 02:46:30,440
Alright, I got mine too!

4145
02:46:34,180 --> 02:46:35,320
He's just running!

4146
02:46:35,840 --> 02:46:36,340
Sir!

4147
02:46:36,840 --> 02:46:37,930
He's just running!

4148
02:46:38,360 --> 02:46:39,060
Oh my god!

4149
02:46:39,240 --> 02:46:39,340
Okay.

4150
02:46:45,460 --> 02:46:45,960
Nice.

4151
02:46:49,400 --> 02:46:49,900
Okay.

4152
02:46:51,180 --> 02:46:52,880
Yeah, that 4% is a lot.

4153
02:46:53,180 --> 02:46:54,120
That actually is a lot.

4154
02:46:54,760 --> 02:46:55,960
Sir, he's just running.

4155
02:46:56,060 --> 02:46:56,600
What do we do?

4156
02:46:56,600 --> 02:46:58,240
They're pushing forward.

4157
02:47:04,210 --> 02:47:05,770
Oh, I thought I could...

4158
02:47:05,770 --> 02:47:07,090
Oh, nice.

4159
02:47:07,230 --> 02:47:07,790
Nice interrupt.

4160
02:47:10,850 --> 02:47:11,990
Oh, that's bad.

4161
02:47:15,450 --> 02:47:16,590
He heals?

4162
02:47:16,730 --> 02:47:17,570
What does that do?

4163
02:47:17,910 --> 02:47:19,270
Okay, I'm very confused.

4164
02:47:19,430 --> 02:47:20,430
Like, what is that doing?

4165
02:47:20,870 --> 02:47:21,450
Like...

4166
02:47:21,450 --> 02:47:23,870
I'm so confused.

4167
02:47:24,690 --> 02:47:25,310
Like...

4168
02:47:25,310 --> 02:47:26,990
What is that doing?

4169
02:47:28,430 --> 02:47:32,030
He's like running and I see like heal range going around.

4170
02:47:32,030 --> 02:47:34,230
I'm like, what is that?

4171
02:47:34,610 --> 02:47:37,270
Is he like shielding his teammates with that?

4172
02:47:37,570 --> 02:47:39,890
Is that what he's trying to do?

4173
02:47:47,110 --> 02:47:48,870
I'm so confused.

4174
02:47:53,350 --> 02:47:55,370
Like, I need this guy to die.

4175
02:47:55,370 --> 02:47:55,750
I...

4176
02:47:55,750 --> 02:47:57,370
I actually...

4177
02:47:59,110 --> 02:47:59,790
No!

4178
02:48:02,190 --> 02:48:03,250
God damn it.

4179
02:48:06,350 --> 02:48:07,030
Okay.

4180
02:48:11,190 --> 02:48:11,530
Okay.

4181
02:48:11,970 --> 02:48:12,410
That's fine.

4182
02:48:15,250 --> 02:48:16,190
Oh my god.

4183
02:48:16,310 --> 02:48:17,470
I need it beyond my all...

4184
02:48:17,470 --> 02:48:18,090
Fuck.

4185
02:48:20,850 --> 02:48:21,890
Jesus Christ.

4186
02:48:21,890 --> 02:48:23,530
It's so much damage.

4187
02:48:23,970 --> 02:48:25,150
It's actually...

4188
02:48:30,440 --> 02:48:31,340
Oh my god.

4189
02:48:35,660 --> 02:48:36,780
It's just damage everyone!

4190
02:48:39,020 --> 02:48:40,620
Oh my god.

4191
02:48:41,640 --> 02:48:43,340
Oh my god.

4192
02:48:43,720 --> 02:48:46,740
Reaper is so hard to play against.

4193
02:48:51,180 --> 02:48:51,700
Okay.

4194
02:48:51,820 --> 02:48:52,540
Okay, our Reaper...

4195
02:48:52,540 --> 02:48:52,740
Okay.

4196
02:48:53,120 --> 02:48:53,300
Alright.

4197
02:48:53,960 --> 02:48:55,480
Our Reaper needs to pick it up.

4198
02:48:59,700 --> 02:49:00,800
Like, I'm...

4199
02:49:00,800 --> 02:49:01,300
Get him!

4200
02:49:02,900 --> 02:49:03,800
Get this!

4201
02:49:05,200 --> 02:49:05,920
Get this!

4202
02:49:06,360 --> 02:49:08,140
Just get this soldier out of here!

4203
02:49:09,520 --> 02:49:11,520
Yeah, their DPS output is...

4204
02:49:11,520 --> 02:49:13,260
To be fair, their Reaper was so strong.

4205
02:49:13,260 --> 02:49:14,060
So he could like...

4206
02:49:14,060 --> 02:49:15,580
Basically max out his damage.

4207
02:49:15,880 --> 02:49:16,240
Every time.

4208
02:49:21,000 --> 02:49:22,540
Yeah, you saw it.

4209
02:49:23,280 --> 02:49:24,320
Hey, that's...

4210
02:49:24,320 --> 02:49:24,900
Wait, who's that?

4211
02:49:25,320 --> 02:49:25,960
Hey, that's me!

4212
02:49:26,200 --> 02:49:27,000
What did I do?

4213
02:49:32,840 --> 02:49:33,440
Yay!

4214
02:49:34,820 --> 02:49:35,760
I did that!

4215
02:49:36,000 --> 02:49:36,560
I got it!

4216
02:49:36,860 --> 02:49:37,540
Best player!

4217
02:49:39,460 --> 02:49:41,500
I don't know how...

4218
02:49:41,500 --> 02:49:42,660
But I'll take it.

4219
02:49:43,440 --> 02:49:45,080
I don't know...

4220
02:49:45,080 --> 02:49:46,540
I did that!

4221
02:49:46,860 --> 02:49:47,340
You see that?

4222
02:49:47,580 --> 02:49:47,900
Play of the game!

4223
02:49:48,100 --> 02:49:49,300
Guys, go check out Stadium.

4224
02:49:49,840 --> 02:49:50,880
Exclamation point.

4225
02:49:51,460 --> 02:49:52,520
Overwatch, guys.

4226
02:49:52,860 --> 02:49:53,800
I mean, Stadium's fun.

4227
02:49:54,040 --> 02:49:54,720
It's just...

4228
02:49:54,720 --> 02:49:56,020
Unlucky that...

4229
02:49:56,020 --> 02:49:57,130
Our enemy Reaper...

4230
02:49:58,820 --> 02:49:59,360
Was...

4231
02:49:59,360 --> 02:50:01,360
Creating a raid boss build.

4232
02:50:01,660 --> 02:50:02,660
Wait, which one is the...

4233
02:50:02,660 --> 02:50:04,780
Okay, so what is the meta support players?

4234
02:50:05,060 --> 02:50:07,020
What are the meta support players for Stadium?

4235
02:50:08,520 --> 02:50:10,000
I lost, but...

4236
02:50:10,000 --> 02:50:10,520
Play of the game!

4237
02:50:11,400 --> 02:50:12,580
Play of the game!

4238
02:50:13,440 --> 02:50:13,980
Hehehehe.

4239
02:50:14,020 --> 02:50:14,160
Hehehehe.

4240
02:50:18,320 --> 02:50:19,760
Missile, Juno?

4241
02:50:20,100 --> 02:50:20,980
Kiri and Juno?

4242
02:50:21,260 --> 02:50:21,580
Wait, okay.

4243
02:50:21,740 --> 02:50:23,140
So what makes Kiri broken?

4244
02:50:24,620 --> 02:50:25,960
I didn't get the win.

4245
02:50:26,280 --> 02:50:27,700
I think everybody...

4246
02:50:27,700 --> 02:50:29,220
Everybody starts off as Rookie.

4247
02:50:32,200 --> 02:50:33,260
Don't listen...

4248
02:50:33,260 --> 02:50:34,240
Don't listen to them!

4249
02:50:34,400 --> 02:50:35,640
Lucio goes crazy!

4250
02:50:37,600 --> 02:50:38,160
Hehehehe.

4251
02:50:38,180 --> 02:50:39,960
Oh, I think it's a Mercy build.

4252
02:50:40,100 --> 02:50:41,420
That she has, like, two reses.

4253
02:50:43,000 --> 02:50:44,120
Two Suzu's.

4254
02:50:44,180 --> 02:50:45,380
Explosive Kunai's.

4255
02:50:45,500 --> 02:50:45,960
Clones?

4256
02:50:46,240 --> 02:50:46,800
Mobility?

4257
02:50:47,300 --> 02:50:48,580
Okay, we'll try...

4258
02:50:48,580 --> 02:50:49,880
Let's try Kiri then.

4259
02:50:50,600 --> 02:50:51,320
No wonder...

4260
02:50:51,320 --> 02:50:52,820
Okay, no wonder I was, like...

4261
02:50:53,240 --> 02:50:55,440
Doing really well in this ELO.

4262
02:50:56,660 --> 02:50:57,500
I was like...

4263
02:50:57,500 --> 02:50:58,560
There's no way...

4264
02:50:58,560 --> 02:50:58,900
Like...

4265
02:50:58,900 --> 02:50:59,420
I was like...

4266
02:50:59,420 --> 02:51:00,820
I could tell what ELO this is.

4267
02:51:01,100 --> 02:51:01,920
Because I was like...

4268
02:51:01,920 --> 02:51:02,240
I...

4269
02:51:02,240 --> 02:51:04,280
There's no way I'm doing more damage than our Reaper.

4270
02:51:04,860 --> 02:51:05,800
As, like...

4271
02:51:05,800 --> 02:51:06,860
Juno during the beginning.

4272
02:51:07,400 --> 02:51:08,060
I'll try Kiri.

4273
02:51:15,200 --> 02:51:15,880
That's me!

4274
02:51:18,800 --> 02:51:19,700
I'm Kiri.

4275
02:51:22,080 --> 02:51:23,160
Alright, so...

4276
02:51:23,160 --> 02:51:24,460
What are the builds for Kiri?

4277
02:51:25,040 --> 02:51:25,960
Where did I go?

4278
02:51:28,140 --> 02:51:29,100
What should I build?

4279
02:51:29,220 --> 02:51:30,060
The most, like...

4280
02:51:30,060 --> 02:51:31,600
The strongest build for Kiri.

4281
02:51:35,800 --> 02:51:36,480
I don't know.

4282
02:51:36,580 --> 02:51:38,020
I forgot to aim as Kiriko though.

4283
02:51:38,960 --> 02:51:39,600
So, I...

4284
02:51:39,600 --> 02:51:41,100
This is gonna be, like...

4285
02:51:41,100 --> 02:51:42,300
A little bit of an issue.

4286
02:51:47,860 --> 02:51:49,380
The only issue is that...

4287
02:51:49,380 --> 02:51:50,400
Her aim is, like...

4288
02:51:50,400 --> 02:51:51,420
Not my best.

4289
02:51:52,820 --> 02:51:53,780
Okay, so...

4290
02:51:53,780 --> 02:51:54,460
Kiri and Mer...

4291
02:51:54,460 --> 02:51:54,740
Mate!

4292
02:51:55,180 --> 02:51:55,860
That's interesting.

4293
02:51:56,840 --> 02:51:57,560
Alright, which one?

4294
02:51:57,860 --> 02:51:59,040
Time for the teams to kill.

4295
02:51:59,040 --> 02:52:00,680
Do I use example builds?

4296
02:52:00,760 --> 02:52:01,760
Or do I build my own?

4297
02:52:02,040 --> 02:52:03,180
Which might not be as pretty.

4298
02:52:04,440 --> 02:52:06,400
Do I get two Suzu's right now?

4299
02:52:07,980 --> 02:52:08,920
Where would it be?

4300
02:52:11,560 --> 02:52:12,680
Bounce in our ally.

4301
02:52:13,060 --> 02:52:13,620
Is it this one?

4302
02:52:13,680 --> 02:52:14,060
Suzu?

4303
02:52:15,040 --> 02:52:16,060
This one right now?

4304
02:52:18,560 --> 02:52:19,360
Okay, we'll get two.

4305
02:52:20,080 --> 02:52:21,160
Alright, so...

4306
02:52:22,320 --> 02:52:22,860
What do we get?

4307
02:52:23,040 --> 02:52:24,020
What should our...

4308
02:52:24,020 --> 02:52:24,580
Uh...

4309
02:52:24,580 --> 02:52:25,280
Thing be then?

4310
02:52:28,500 --> 02:52:29,100
Uh...

4311
02:52:29,100 --> 02:52:30,520
What should our main ones be?

4312
02:52:31,660 --> 02:52:32,260
Compensator.

4313
02:52:32,500 --> 02:52:33,100
Power...

4314
02:52:33,100 --> 02:52:33,920
Playbook.

4315
02:52:35,200 --> 02:52:37,000
We focus on weapon power.

4316
02:52:37,120 --> 02:52:38,040
Ability power.

4317
02:52:39,860 --> 02:52:40,860
First aid.

4318
02:52:41,140 --> 02:52:41,460
Weapon.

4319
02:52:43,160 --> 02:52:44,120
Attack speed.

4320
02:52:44,440 --> 02:52:45,960
Get as many greens as possible.

4321
02:52:46,200 --> 02:52:46,740
Do I use these?

4322
02:52:51,280 --> 02:52:52,120
Go weapon?

4323
02:52:52,420 --> 02:52:53,360
Get weapon power.

4324
02:52:53,840 --> 02:52:54,100
Okay.

4325
02:52:54,840 --> 02:52:55,440
And then what?

4326
02:52:56,660 --> 02:52:57,440
Do I do...

4327
02:53:00,000 --> 02:53:01,020
What else do I do?

4328
02:53:02,380 --> 02:53:03,380
Attack speed maybe?

4329
02:53:03,620 --> 02:53:04,060
Ability?

4330
02:53:04,280 --> 02:53:05,000
Ability power?

4331
02:53:05,180 --> 02:53:05,880
Weapon and ability.

4332
02:53:06,100 --> 02:53:06,280
Okay.

4333
02:53:06,920 --> 02:53:07,760
What about attack speed?

4334
02:53:07,840 --> 02:53:08,680
Is that important or no?

4335
02:53:08,840 --> 02:53:09,820
I'll get shield as well.

4336
02:53:10,260 --> 02:53:12,200
I feel like more heals might as well.

4337
02:53:12,400 --> 02:53:13,260
Or life steal.

4338
02:53:13,620 --> 02:53:13,740
Maybe?

4339
02:53:15,220 --> 02:53:16,060
Life steal.

4340
02:53:17,220 --> 02:53:18,400
Life steal is good.

4341
02:53:21,180 --> 02:53:21,660
Alright.

4342
02:53:22,420 --> 02:53:22,480
Alright.

4343
02:53:22,480 --> 02:53:24,240
The armory is about to close.

4344
02:53:24,400 --> 02:53:25,360
Did I get everything I can?

4345
02:53:25,540 --> 02:53:25,680
Yeah.

4346
02:53:30,820 --> 02:53:31,300
Alright.

4347
02:53:31,340 --> 02:53:31,780
Let's see.

4348
02:53:32,700 --> 02:53:33,180
Oh!

4349
02:53:33,320 --> 02:53:34,200
Life steal is not worth it.

4350
02:53:34,260 --> 02:53:34,860
God damn it!

4351
02:53:34,900 --> 02:53:35,820
I should've got attack speed.

4352
02:53:37,260 --> 02:53:38,260
I did it!

4353
02:53:38,500 --> 02:53:38,640
No!

4354
02:53:38,800 --> 02:53:40,220
I should've got attack speed!

4355
02:53:41,260 --> 02:53:41,740
No!

4356
02:53:44,100 --> 02:53:44,940
I was...

4357
02:53:44,940 --> 02:53:45,540
Guys!

4358
02:53:45,540 --> 02:53:46,780
You could've told me!

4359
02:53:50,220 --> 02:53:51,640
Why didn't you tell me?

4360
02:53:53,580 --> 02:53:54,600
Why didn't you tell me?

4361
02:53:55,720 --> 02:53:56,140
Okay.

4362
02:54:00,460 --> 02:54:00,880
What?

4363
02:54:01,060 --> 02:54:01,560
Oh my god!

4364
02:54:01,760 --> 02:54:02,720
Okay, his DPS is better.

4365
02:54:03,600 --> 02:54:05,020
His DPS was stronger.

4366
02:54:05,300 --> 02:54:07,040
Oh my god, he headshot me.

4367
02:54:07,160 --> 02:54:07,920
That was crazy.

4368
02:54:09,680 --> 02:54:12,320
He actually headshot me.

4369
02:54:12,520 --> 02:54:13,760
I didn't realize he could do that.

4370
02:54:14,440 --> 02:54:16,800
I didn't realize he can headshot me there.

4371
02:54:17,100 --> 02:54:17,840
Alright, let's see.

4372
02:54:18,000 --> 02:54:18,240
Shift.

4373
02:54:19,300 --> 02:54:21,140
Oh my god, it's been so long since I played Kiri.

4374
02:54:22,380 --> 02:54:22,740
Here we go.

4375
02:54:25,040 --> 02:54:26,520
What are the X's?

4376
02:54:32,170 --> 02:54:34,230
Everything feels a little slow though on Kiri.

4377
02:54:37,550 --> 02:54:38,410
Get over here.

4378
02:54:39,910 --> 02:54:41,110
Get over here.

4379
02:54:41,790 --> 02:54:42,430
No!

4380
02:54:44,650 --> 02:54:47,110
I'm trying my best to heal you!

4381
02:54:49,030 --> 02:54:52,110
I can't even DPS because you're taking so much damage!

4382
02:54:55,920 --> 02:54:56,960
Get over there.

4383
02:54:57,280 --> 02:54:58,520
Get over there, Ryan!

4384
02:54:59,380 --> 02:55:00,600
Get over there!

4385
02:55:04,320 --> 02:55:05,260
There you go.

4386
02:55:05,980 --> 02:55:07,240
That's fucking right!

4387
02:55:07,240 --> 02:55:09,260
They're pushing the barricade.

4388
02:55:09,660 --> 02:55:10,140
Okay.

4389
02:55:10,720 --> 02:55:11,940
I have another- No!

4390
02:55:12,360 --> 02:55:13,300
I didn't have a Suzu!

4391
02:55:13,620 --> 02:55:15,400
I didn't have another Suzu!

4392
02:55:16,780 --> 02:55:18,340
I was gonna be like, don't worry.

4393
02:55:18,600 --> 02:55:20,120
I got another Suzu.

4394
02:55:21,140 --> 02:55:21,620
Worry.

4395
02:55:21,620 --> 02:55:22,500
I did it.

4396
02:55:25,800 --> 02:55:26,900
Oh my god.

4397
02:55:30,620 --> 02:55:31,340
There we go.

4398
02:55:32,960 --> 02:55:33,880
Oh my god, please.

4399
02:55:34,120 --> 02:55:37,060
I am working so hard keeping you alive.

4400
02:55:37,060 --> 02:55:41,380
I- I- I don't know- I don't know how much more I can do.

4401
02:55:41,600 --> 02:55:47,300
I- I- I don't know how much more I can do.

4402
02:55:47,560 --> 02:55:55,300
I- I don't know how much- I tried so hard to keep them up.

4403
02:55:57,120 --> 02:55:58,820
Wait, our Ash- Okay.

4404
02:55:58,940 --> 02:55:59,880
I was gonna speed that.

4405
02:56:08,460 --> 02:56:09,400
Oh, nice.

4406
02:56:09,860 --> 02:56:10,600
That's good.

4407
02:56:11,980 --> 02:56:12,720
That's good.

4408
02:56:15,740 --> 02:56:16,300
Okay.

4409
02:56:19,280 --> 02:56:19,940
Don't worry.

4410
02:56:20,040 --> 02:56:21,600
We're- we're not okay, but don't worry.

4411
02:56:22,000 --> 02:56:22,880
Don't worry.

4412
02:56:23,140 --> 02:56:24,680
We're not okay, but don't worry.

4413
02:56:25,780 --> 02:56:26,680
You're fine!

4414
02:56:26,680 --> 02:56:27,460
Seconds remaining.

4415
02:56:28,420 --> 02:56:29,480
Oh my god.

4416
02:56:29,640 --> 02:56:32,680
This- these X's, though, is like bothering me so much.

4417
02:56:33,240 --> 02:56:34,360
I don't like it.

4418
02:56:37,500 --> 02:56:38,900
Oh no, this is bad.

4419
02:56:39,200 --> 02:56:40,020
This is bad.

4420
02:56:40,620 --> 02:56:41,320
This is bad.

4421
02:56:41,480 --> 02:56:42,780
I don't have anything else.

4422
02:56:43,760 --> 02:56:44,760
Oh, don't!

4423
02:56:44,880 --> 02:56:47,960
Why is my DPS not doing as much as them?!

4424
02:56:49,640 --> 02:56:50,160
Why?!

4425
02:56:51,340 --> 02:56:54,320
I can't DPS because I have to heal!

4426
02:56:56,680 --> 02:56:59,340
It was a hard fight, but they lose this round.

4427
02:57:00,220 --> 02:57:00,860
No.

4428
02:57:02,380 --> 02:57:03,020
No.

4429
02:57:03,340 --> 02:57:04,640
The thing is...

4430
02:57:04,640 --> 02:57:05,820
The thing is...

4431
02:57:06,460 --> 02:57:07,520
Oh, it's me.

4432
02:57:11,360 --> 02:57:12,860
I wonder why!

4433
02:57:14,920 --> 02:57:15,880
It's me.

4434
02:57:16,300 --> 02:57:17,680
Why am I MVP?!

4435
02:57:18,580 --> 02:57:19,220
Team!

4436
02:57:19,980 --> 02:57:20,620
Please!

4437
02:57:21,140 --> 02:57:21,280
Team!

4438
02:57:21,920 --> 02:57:23,740
Okay, what do I do in second round?

4439
02:57:27,820 --> 02:57:30,140
What do I do in second round, guys?

4440
02:57:30,740 --> 02:57:31,100
What?

4441
02:57:33,100 --> 02:57:35,560
Okay, I should get rid of the life steal.

4442
02:57:35,720 --> 02:57:37,280
Life steal was a mistake.

4443
02:57:37,620 --> 02:57:38,440
And then...

4444
02:57:38,440 --> 02:57:39,580
Should I get blue?

4445
02:57:40,120 --> 02:57:42,320
Should I start getting blue and get weapon of power?

4446
02:57:43,660 --> 02:57:46,020
Getting 10% attack speed for 3 seconds.

4447
02:57:46,200 --> 02:57:46,740
Weapon power.

4448
02:57:46,740 --> 02:57:48,480
It's a fierce competition.

4449
02:57:49,020 --> 02:57:50,420
Who will cave to the pressure?

4450
02:57:50,860 --> 02:57:51,880
And who will come out?

4451
02:57:52,020 --> 02:57:52,220
Uh...

4452
02:57:52,220 --> 02:57:53,140
Should I get attack speed?

4453
02:57:53,300 --> 02:57:53,940
More attack speed?

4454
02:57:54,140 --> 02:57:54,500
Or...

4455
02:57:54,500 --> 02:57:55,160
Ability power?

4456
02:57:57,100 --> 02:57:57,660
Or...

4457
02:58:02,820 --> 02:58:03,380
Uh...

4458
02:58:03,380 --> 02:58:04,580
Or 10% gain.

4459
02:58:04,720 --> 02:58:06,160
200% projectile speed.

4460
02:58:06,520 --> 02:58:07,760
Oh, I could get this.

4461
02:58:08,280 --> 02:58:10,040
I can grant them 10% move speed.

4462
02:58:10,340 --> 02:58:12,240
I guess I'll try this.

4463
02:58:12,740 --> 02:58:12,980
Right?

4464
02:58:14,840 --> 02:58:17,030
Get, like, attack speed and then...

4465
02:58:18,780 --> 02:58:19,860
More attack speed.

4466
02:58:21,900 --> 02:58:22,680
I don't know.

4467
02:58:22,820 --> 02:58:23,160
I don't know.

4468
02:58:23,340 --> 02:58:26,280
Guys, I'm trying to get my spreadsheet up, but I don't...

4469
02:58:26,280 --> 02:58:27,160
But it's not...

4470
02:58:27,160 --> 02:58:28,320
I'm not cooking correctly.

4471
02:58:28,820 --> 02:58:29,280
I...

4472
02:58:30,780 --> 02:58:31,880
My attack sheet...

4473
02:58:31,880 --> 02:58:34,300
I don't know what I'm doing with my attack...

4474
02:58:34,300 --> 02:58:35,880
My spreadsheet right now.

4475
02:58:35,880 --> 02:58:36,720
I...

4476
02:58:39,240 --> 02:58:42,260
I might not be cooking very correctly, guys.

4477
02:58:51,360 --> 02:58:51,940
Fine.

4478
02:58:52,700 --> 02:58:53,940
Juno, what are you doing?

4479
02:58:58,200 --> 02:58:59,020
It's fine.

4480
02:59:03,610 --> 02:59:04,630
Okay, there you go.

4481
02:59:04,710 --> 02:59:07,330
I had to use both to keep me and Ryan alive.

4482
02:59:11,500 --> 02:59:12,080
Okay.

4483
02:59:12,540 --> 02:59:14,040
Oh, I need to focus up.

4484
02:59:15,060 --> 02:59:16,840
Oh, I can't climb up that.

4485
02:59:17,500 --> 02:59:18,460
I thought I could.

4486
02:59:21,020 --> 02:59:21,500
No!

4487
02:59:21,620 --> 02:59:23,400
I tried so hard to keep you up!

4488
02:59:23,600 --> 02:59:24,840
I swear to God!

4489
02:59:28,660 --> 02:59:29,780
I swear to God.

4490
02:59:29,940 --> 02:59:30,060
Okay.

4491
02:59:30,300 --> 02:59:30,540
Nice.

4492
02:59:32,620 --> 02:59:34,100
That means I can DPS now.

4493
02:59:36,500 --> 02:59:37,560
Well, that's fine.

4494
02:59:39,340 --> 02:59:40,100
That's fine.

4495
02:59:40,800 --> 02:59:41,380
I'm okay.

4496
02:59:41,480 --> 02:59:42,240
I'm not okay!

4497
02:59:42,460 --> 02:59:42,620
No!

4498
02:59:42,780 --> 02:59:43,720
It's not fine!

4499
02:59:45,580 --> 02:59:46,680
It's not fine!

4500
02:59:47,440 --> 02:59:48,660
Things are not fine!

4501
02:59:51,800 --> 02:59:55,600
I thought it was fine, but it ended up not being fine.

4502
02:59:56,060 --> 02:59:57,200
Time to try again.

4503
02:59:57,480 --> 02:59:59,140
I don't know where my Juno was.

4504
02:59:59,260 --> 02:59:59,800
Now I'm gonna...

4505
03:00:05,900 --> 03:00:08,600
I have no idea where my Juno was.

4506
03:00:08,780 --> 03:00:10,740
I just felt like it was me and the Ryan in the world.

4507
03:00:14,340 --> 03:00:15,520
It's okay, though.

4508
03:00:16,460 --> 03:00:16,820
It's okay, though.

4509
03:00:16,820 --> 03:00:17,800
Sometimes it do be like that.

4510
03:00:19,580 --> 03:00:20,000
Jeez.

4511
03:00:20,900 --> 03:00:23,920
I have to use double so my Ryan won't die.

4512
03:00:26,160 --> 03:00:27,080
It's okay, Ryan.

4513
03:00:27,300 --> 03:00:27,940
We're gonna do...

4514
03:00:27,940 --> 03:00:28,560
Okay.

4515
03:00:29,160 --> 03:00:30,300
Alright, let's kill her.

4516
03:00:30,700 --> 03:00:31,440
Oh, no.

4517
03:00:31,680 --> 03:00:31,900
No!

4518
03:00:34,760 --> 03:00:36,400
I thought we could get it.

4519
03:00:36,580 --> 03:00:38,800
I wanted to kill that one guy.

4520
03:00:39,380 --> 03:00:40,760
But it didn't work.

4521
03:00:43,320 --> 03:00:45,600
I wanted to see if we could both kill him.

4522
03:00:46,260 --> 03:00:47,520
I got baited.

4523
03:00:47,580 --> 03:00:49,480
I got baited by my Ryan.

4524
03:00:49,860 --> 03:00:51,000
I was like, we can do this right.

4525
03:00:51,140 --> 03:00:51,700
Me and you.

4526
03:00:52,680 --> 03:00:54,180
Our Ryan is our best player.

4527
03:00:54,180 --> 03:00:54,900
You're not gonna lie.

4528
03:00:55,000 --> 03:00:55,280
Alright.

4529
03:01:01,260 --> 03:01:03,100
What is it like to be able to DPS?

4530
03:01:05,840 --> 03:01:06,940
What is it like?

4531
03:01:13,930 --> 03:01:16,310
I have to keep my Ryan up all the time!

4532
03:01:19,090 --> 03:01:20,370
What is it like?

4533
03:01:23,310 --> 03:01:23,710
Why?

4534
03:01:28,330 --> 03:01:28,850
What?

4535
03:01:29,230 --> 03:01:30,890
I don't understand!

4536
03:01:31,750 --> 03:01:33,590
I shouldn't be MVP!

4537
03:01:34,150 --> 03:01:35,390
This is my second game!

4538
03:01:36,050 --> 03:01:37,330
Trying to figure out spreadsheets!

4539
03:01:38,350 --> 03:01:38,910
Alright.

4540
03:01:39,050 --> 03:01:40,150
What do we do after that?

4541
03:01:41,630 --> 03:01:42,230
Clones?

4542
03:01:44,310 --> 03:01:44,910
Okay.

4543
03:01:45,010 --> 03:01:45,450
What do we...

4544
03:01:45,450 --> 03:01:47,610
What do we get after that?

4545
03:01:48,430 --> 03:01:48,850
Guys.

4546
03:01:50,710 --> 03:01:51,710
You see, guys.

4547
03:01:51,850 --> 03:01:53,210
I need more than I can.

4548
03:01:53,410 --> 03:01:54,650
Just keep having MVP.

4549
03:01:56,030 --> 03:01:57,790
Clones are explosive kunai.

4550
03:01:57,790 --> 03:01:58,030
Okay.

4551
03:01:58,150 --> 03:01:59,450
Where is explosive kunai?

4552
03:02:00,370 --> 03:02:00,610
Okay.

4553
03:02:00,750 --> 03:02:01,430
Increase, decrease.

4554
03:02:02,430 --> 03:02:03,310
I'll do...

4555
03:02:05,530 --> 03:02:07,090
Do my clones do stuff too?

4556
03:02:09,830 --> 03:02:11,370
Where is explosive kunai?

4557
03:02:13,490 --> 03:02:14,390
Where is it?

4558
03:02:16,230 --> 03:02:17,070
Oh, here you go!

4559
03:02:17,150 --> 03:02:17,670
Your third...

4560
03:02:17,670 --> 03:02:18,170
Okay, here you go.

4561
03:02:19,710 --> 03:02:20,570
Okay, there you go.

4562
03:02:21,230 --> 03:02:22,170
And then...

4563
03:02:22,170 --> 03:02:22,930
Let me see.

4564
03:02:24,910 --> 03:02:25,390
Weapon...

4565
03:02:25,390 --> 03:02:26,930
When you heal it, I need more healing.

4566
03:02:26,930 --> 03:02:29,230
My teammate is not doing okay.

4567
03:02:30,070 --> 03:02:30,770
I need...

4568
03:02:30,770 --> 03:02:31,770
My team needs...

4569
03:02:31,770 --> 03:02:33,870
My team needs more heals.

4570
03:02:38,690 --> 03:02:39,290
Uh...

4571
03:02:40,690 --> 03:02:41,990
My clones heal?

4572
03:02:42,170 --> 03:02:42,810
Wait, do they?

4573
03:02:43,830 --> 03:02:44,710
Oh, okay.

4574
03:02:44,790 --> 03:02:45,810
Let me sell it then.

4575
03:02:46,970 --> 03:02:47,370
Can I stop?

4576
03:02:47,690 --> 03:02:49,250
I can't sell it!

4577
03:02:49,450 --> 03:02:50,730
Oh, I didn't know!

4578
03:02:50,730 --> 03:02:53,090
20 seconds left until we kick this round off.

4579
03:02:53,090 --> 03:02:54,190
Ability power for more healing.

4580
03:02:54,410 --> 03:02:54,550
Okay.

4581
03:02:59,780 --> 03:03:01,190
I'm trying to find ability.

4582
03:03:03,640 --> 03:03:04,280
In there.

4583
03:03:05,480 --> 03:03:05,800
All right.

4584
03:03:05,880 --> 03:03:06,560
I don't know.

4585
03:03:06,980 --> 03:03:07,740
It's over.

4586
03:03:08,020 --> 03:03:08,240
I...

4587
03:03:08,240 --> 03:03:09,380
I got confused.

4588
03:03:09,720 --> 03:03:10,780
I got confused.

4589
03:03:10,780 --> 03:03:10,820
No!

4590
03:03:11,000 --> 03:03:12,000
There's a plus 20!

4591
03:03:12,540 --> 03:03:14,000
Guys, I got confused!

4592
03:03:14,700 --> 03:03:15,220
My head!

4593
03:03:17,840 --> 03:03:18,420
3...

4594
03:03:18,420 --> 03:03:19,460
2...

4595
03:03:20,560 --> 03:03:21,140
1...

4596
03:03:21,140 --> 03:03:22,360
Capture the objective!

4597
03:03:22,480 --> 03:03:22,800
All right.

4598
03:03:26,260 --> 03:03:26,840
Commit!

4599
03:03:27,080 --> 03:03:28,100
Guys, I don't know.

4600
03:03:28,220 --> 03:03:30,540
My teammates have been dying really, really fast.

4601
03:03:30,540 --> 03:03:32,460
I don't know if we can do that, guys.

4602
03:03:32,940 --> 03:03:33,300
I...

4603
03:03:33,300 --> 03:03:33,720
I...

4604
03:03:34,240 --> 03:03:37,620
I would love to be like, I don't care about my teammates.

4605
03:03:37,860 --> 03:03:38,200
But...

4606
03:03:38,200 --> 03:03:40,840
It does not look so good for my team.

4607
03:03:41,060 --> 03:03:41,860
In general.

4608
03:03:43,660 --> 03:03:44,880
Okay, Juno.

4609
03:03:45,040 --> 03:03:45,800
Just stand there.

4610
03:03:48,140 --> 03:03:48,780
What?

4611
03:03:51,740 --> 03:03:53,100
Oh my god.

4612
03:03:53,700 --> 03:03:54,340
Like...

4613
03:03:56,720 --> 03:03:57,360
Okay.

4614
03:04:00,900 --> 03:04:01,860
Thank you.

4615
03:04:02,260 --> 03:04:02,940
Thank you.

4616
03:04:03,040 --> 03:04:03,760
That's all I wanted.

4617
03:04:06,020 --> 03:04:06,680
That's good.

4618
03:04:13,570 --> 03:04:14,210
That's fine.

4619
03:04:14,330 --> 03:04:14,990
Me and my Ryan.

4620
03:04:16,450 --> 03:04:19,350
Me and my Ryan is just doing whatever we can.

4621
03:04:21,670 --> 03:04:22,150
Just...

4622
03:04:22,150 --> 03:04:22,450
Yeah.

4623
03:04:22,910 --> 03:04:23,970
Okay, that's cool.

4624
03:04:24,110 --> 03:04:24,450
That's cool.

4625
03:04:24,590 --> 03:04:24,910
That's cool.

4626
03:04:25,090 --> 03:04:25,410
That's cool.

4627
03:04:28,070 --> 03:04:28,750
What's the...

4628
03:04:28,750 --> 03:04:29,930
She's doing her best.

4629
03:04:30,070 --> 03:04:31,290
She bought Doki Watch.

4630
03:04:31,610 --> 03:04:32,090
She...

4631
03:04:35,990 --> 03:04:36,670
Arjuno...

4632
03:04:36,670 --> 03:04:38,450
Arjuno spent money, okay?

4633
03:04:39,330 --> 03:04:40,610
She's doing it.

4634
03:04:40,690 --> 03:04:41,350
She's doing it.

4635
03:04:43,950 --> 03:04:46,290
She at least spent money, alright?

4636
03:04:46,630 --> 03:04:47,490
Let's just let it...

4637
03:04:50,410 --> 03:04:52,050
Man, I would...

4638
03:04:52,910 --> 03:04:54,530
I'm sorry, sir.

4639
03:04:54,930 --> 03:04:55,270
I...

4640
03:04:55,270 --> 03:04:57,210
We escaped both by Suzu.

4641
03:04:59,990 --> 03:05:00,750
It's fine.

4642
03:05:04,210 --> 03:05:05,130
It's fine.

4643
03:05:05,350 --> 03:05:05,890
It's fine.

4644
03:05:06,130 --> 03:05:07,230
There we go.

4645
03:05:08,890 --> 03:05:10,090
There we go.

4646
03:05:10,850 --> 03:05:11,490
Go in.

4647
03:05:12,250 --> 03:05:13,230
Go in.

4648
03:05:14,890 --> 03:05:15,910
Go in.

4649
03:05:16,550 --> 03:05:17,690
Go in!

4650
03:05:18,430 --> 03:05:19,590
Oh my god!

4651
03:05:22,030 --> 03:05:23,150
Alright, nice.

4652
03:05:29,030 --> 03:05:29,810
It's okay.

4653
03:05:34,540 --> 03:05:37,240
I swear, I'm mostly, like, I have to heal.

4654
03:05:37,600 --> 03:05:38,560
Like, I don't...

4655
03:05:38,560 --> 03:05:41,240
I'm not trying to, but I actually have to heal.

4656
03:05:41,480 --> 03:05:43,940
Because Arjuno's not healing our Ryan.

4657
03:05:44,180 --> 03:05:45,760
So I have to...

4658
03:05:47,520 --> 03:05:48,580
Oh, whoops.

4659
03:05:52,500 --> 03:05:53,040
Alright.

4660
03:05:57,130 --> 03:05:57,450
Okay.

4661
03:05:57,790 --> 03:05:58,170
That's okay.

4662
03:06:00,490 --> 03:06:02,850
Like, I wanted DPS, but I can't.

4663
03:06:02,950 --> 03:06:06,150
So I have to stop building DPS builds because of it.

4664
03:06:09,010 --> 03:06:09,670
What are you doing?

4665
03:06:09,730 --> 03:06:10,070
I'm here.

4666
03:06:14,330 --> 03:06:15,170
Okay, that's good.

4667
03:06:15,310 --> 03:06:16,450
We made him use that ult.

4668
03:06:17,250 --> 03:06:18,950
Um, Ryan, our teammates are...

4669
03:06:18,950 --> 03:06:20,170
Our teammates need help.

4670
03:06:20,550 --> 03:06:20,990
Ryan?

4671
03:06:20,990 --> 03:06:21,130
Ryan?

4672
03:06:24,370 --> 03:06:25,050
Ryan?

4673
03:06:25,750 --> 03:06:26,430
Ryan?

4674
03:06:26,570 --> 03:06:27,890
Ryan, might be a little...

4675
03:06:29,630 --> 03:06:32,010
Might be a little too over-cellless here.

4676
03:06:32,770 --> 03:06:34,190
Might be...

4677
03:06:36,570 --> 03:06:39,170
Oh, I couldn't do anything there.

4678
03:06:40,430 --> 03:06:43,130
It means my thing can't go past.

4679
03:06:43,290 --> 03:06:44,890
Why did I... Okay.

4680
03:06:45,650 --> 03:06:47,810
It means I can't go past the thing.

4681
03:06:49,190 --> 03:06:53,070
I can't... I... I'm tired.

4682
03:06:55,250 --> 03:06:58,230
I'm tired of being MVP.

4683
03:07:05,010 --> 03:07:07,790
Team, I'm so tired.

4684
03:07:10,770 --> 03:07:11,390
Okay.

4685
03:07:12,250 --> 03:07:18,350
Alright, we're gonna do more heals because my teammate needs more help with the heal department.

4686
03:07:18,790 --> 03:07:20,610
So, let's get the 20%.

4687
03:07:20,610 --> 03:07:26,870
And then, sadly, I have to heal more, sadly.

4688
03:07:28,870 --> 03:07:30,110
10%, 35%.

4689
03:07:30,110 --> 03:07:33,730
Alright, let's see how much I can... We don't need attack speed.

4690
03:07:33,870 --> 03:07:34,870
Let's just...

4691
03:07:37,290 --> 03:07:39,630
The suffering from success.

4692
03:07:40,290 --> 03:07:43,670
Alright, surely my teammates will survive, right?

4693
03:07:43,970 --> 03:07:44,930
Oh, I should get purples.

4694
03:07:45,070 --> 03:07:46,250
I almost forgot about the purples.

4695
03:07:46,710 --> 03:07:47,850
Do I have enough money?

4696
03:07:48,070 --> 03:07:49,050
I should have enough.

4697
03:07:49,670 --> 03:07:51,330
Alright, I'll sell my last green.

4698
03:07:51,330 --> 03:07:54,850
Only 20 seconds left until we kick this round off.

4699
03:07:54,850 --> 03:07:56,770
And then...

4700
03:07:58,810 --> 03:08:01,710
20%, 25%, 10%, 15%.

4701
03:08:03,770 --> 03:08:04,470
Oh, shit.

4702
03:08:04,650 --> 03:08:04,770
Okay.

4703
03:08:06,130 --> 03:08:06,990
Okay, there you go.

4704
03:08:08,470 --> 03:08:10,810
Alright, I'm just... I can't.

4705
03:08:10,950 --> 03:08:12,930
I just need to make sure my Ryan doesn't die.

4706
03:08:12,930 --> 03:08:17,090
Alright, I... I need to... I need to make sure.

4707
03:08:18,330 --> 03:08:19,730
I need to make sure.

4708
03:08:22,610 --> 03:08:23,210
Alright.

4709
03:08:23,770 --> 03:08:26,270
After this, we'll try... We'll do another Juno build.

4710
03:08:29,690 --> 03:08:30,290
Alright.

4711
03:08:32,890 --> 03:08:35,530
Wait, Talisman healing is weapon power?

4712
03:08:35,770 --> 03:08:37,470
Why did everybody tell me to do it?

4713
03:08:37,570 --> 03:08:38,110
Okay.

4714
03:08:38,630 --> 03:08:38,930
Alright.

4715
03:08:39,430 --> 03:08:39,810
Okay.

4716
03:08:40,110 --> 03:08:41,370
It wasn't...

4717
03:08:41,370 --> 03:08:42,390
Alright, so apparently...

4718
03:08:43,690 --> 03:08:45,290
It was not...

4719
03:08:47,030 --> 03:08:47,750
Alright.

4720
03:08:48,110 --> 03:08:48,870
Well, now I know.

4721
03:08:49,670 --> 03:08:50,270
Guys!

4722
03:08:50,570 --> 03:08:51,170
Shoot!

4723
03:08:52,530 --> 03:08:53,250
Okay.

4724
03:08:53,570 --> 03:08:53,950
That's fine.

4725
03:08:57,230 --> 03:08:59,610
Alright, I didn't realize...

4726
03:08:59,610 --> 03:09:01,810
Ability power was...

4727
03:09:02,650 --> 03:09:04,070
You're so lucky.

4728
03:09:04,310 --> 03:09:05,450
You're so lucky.

4729
03:09:05,890 --> 03:09:07,150
But who's gonna...

4730
03:09:11,920 --> 03:09:12,640
Wimp.

4731
03:09:16,180 --> 03:09:16,900
Okay.

4732
03:09:17,900 --> 03:09:18,780
Alright.

4733
03:09:20,320 --> 03:09:21,140
There we go.

4734
03:09:25,400 --> 03:09:28,640
Me and Ryan against the world!

4735
03:09:29,540 --> 03:09:31,420
Me and Ryan!

4736
03:09:34,160 --> 03:09:36,580
Me and Ryan against the world!

4737
03:09:39,720 --> 03:09:41,500
I had to just heal.

4738
03:09:42,660 --> 03:09:45,060
All I did was just make sure...

4739
03:09:47,960 --> 03:09:48,600
Alright.

4740
03:09:49,140 --> 03:09:53,100
Okay, now that I know, Talisman is weapon power.

4741
03:09:56,900 --> 03:10:03,200
My Ryan and I... is just my Ryan and I.

4742
03:10:04,160 --> 03:10:08,820
I... You're welcome.

4743
03:10:10,080 --> 03:10:11,140
You're welcome.

4744
03:10:12,400 --> 03:10:14,900
Alright, me and Ryan against the world.

4745
03:10:15,040 --> 03:10:15,340
Okay.

4746
03:10:15,840 --> 03:10:16,740
Yet again.

4747
03:10:17,720 --> 03:10:19,120
Let's go, you and I.

4748
03:10:19,860 --> 03:10:21,720
You and I against the world.

4749
03:10:22,260 --> 03:10:22,780
Let's go.

4750
03:10:23,100 --> 03:10:25,080
You and I against the world.

4751
03:10:29,880 --> 03:10:30,880
They don't know.

4752
03:10:30,980 --> 03:10:31,520
They don't know.

4753
03:10:31,580 --> 03:10:31,860
They don't know.

4754
03:10:31,940 --> 03:10:32,220
They don't know.

4755
03:10:32,280 --> 03:10:32,280
They don't know.

4756
03:10:32,280 --> 03:10:32,560
They don't know.

4757
03:10:32,680 --> 03:10:32,760
They don't know.

4758
03:10:32,760 --> 03:10:32,940
They don't know.

4759
03:10:33,960 --> 03:10:36,100
You and I against the world, Ryan!

4760
03:10:38,080 --> 03:10:39,480
It's you and I!

4761
03:10:40,800 --> 03:10:41,280
My...

4762
03:10:44,280 --> 03:10:47,620
I can't DPS because it's just you and I, right?

4763
03:10:48,320 --> 03:10:49,560
Wish I could!

4764
03:10:52,700 --> 03:10:57,720
Wish I could shoot my gun, but it's just you and I, right?

4765
03:10:58,280 --> 03:11:00,200
We're against the world!

4766
03:11:04,920 --> 03:11:06,580
Wonder what it's like!

4767
03:11:12,270 --> 03:11:14,030
Wish I know what it's like!

4768
03:11:14,090 --> 03:11:15,650
I'm gonna shoot my gun!

4769
03:11:17,430 --> 03:11:18,390
There we go.

4770
03:11:22,410 --> 03:11:23,410
Okay, cat.

4771
03:11:23,590 --> 03:11:25,330
We had a rotten shield.

4772
03:11:25,990 --> 03:11:26,350
Okay.

4773
03:11:30,970 --> 03:11:31,930
Okay, nice.

4774
03:11:33,030 --> 03:11:33,270
Alright.

4775
03:11:35,410 --> 03:11:36,030
Alright.

4776
03:11:36,350 --> 03:11:37,110
It's fine.

4777
03:11:37,970 --> 03:11:41,170
Dude, I'm just... it's like... keep Ryan alive.

4778
03:11:41,270 --> 03:11:42,870
Look, he has 8k damage!

4779
03:11:43,210 --> 03:11:45,510
How much more does our Ryan have to do?

4780
03:11:45,650 --> 03:11:47,750
He actually has 8k.

4781
03:11:48,210 --> 03:11:49,590
Oh my god.

4782
03:11:50,290 --> 03:11:51,110
I... okay.

4783
03:11:51,290 --> 03:11:52,170
I need to know.

4784
03:11:53,010 --> 03:11:53,610
Finally!

4785
03:11:53,790 --> 03:11:56,010
Our Ryan has finally got MVP!

4786
03:11:56,610 --> 03:11:58,210
Guys, I need to know.

4787
03:11:58,430 --> 03:12:02,810
Do I do weapon power or do I do ability power?

4788
03:12:02,810 --> 03:12:05,690
Which is weapon power in my heals?

4789
03:12:06,410 --> 03:12:09,010
Because then I will redo all my...

4790
03:12:10,470 --> 03:12:11,190
Alright.

4791
03:12:12,690 --> 03:12:13,870
There is hope.

4792
03:12:14,650 --> 03:12:18,550
Because I will re- re-evaluate... myself.

4793
03:12:21,330 --> 03:12:22,050
Okay.

4794
03:12:22,290 --> 03:12:22,850
Weapon power.

4795
03:12:22,970 --> 03:12:23,150
Okay.

4796
03:12:23,230 --> 03:12:23,930
I will sell...

4797
03:12:25,990 --> 03:12:27,750
I'm gonna sell this...

4798
03:12:28,430 --> 03:12:30,570
And then get weapon power.

4799
03:12:30,910 --> 03:12:32,970
Plus 20% up...

4800
03:12:32,970 --> 03:12:33,710
Weapon... 25!

4801
03:12:33,950 --> 03:12:34,350
There we go!

4802
03:12:35,830 --> 03:12:36,430
25...

4803
03:12:37,750 --> 03:12:38,350
Percent...

4804
03:12:38,350 --> 03:12:39,310
Weapon power.

4805
03:12:39,470 --> 03:12:40,010
There we go!

4806
03:12:40,250 --> 03:12:41,150
That's a lot more!

4807
03:12:41,470 --> 03:12:42,410
That is a lot!

4808
03:12:43,070 --> 03:12:45,250
Okay, and then I can...

4809
03:12:45,250 --> 03:12:47,390
Okay, let me put more on weapon power then.

4810
03:12:47,590 --> 03:12:50,190
5%, 10%, 20%, 10%.

4811
03:12:50,190 --> 03:12:51,390
I'll get less that.

4812
03:12:51,650 --> 03:12:52,910
And then put...

4813
03:12:57,630 --> 03:12:58,230
On...

4814
03:12:58,230 --> 03:13:00,810
We're in the middle innings and everyone's waiting to see...

4815
03:13:01,050 --> 03:13:01,350
Do you see the scaling?

4816
03:13:01,670 --> 03:13:02,190
What do you mean?

4817
03:13:02,870 --> 03:13:04,390
I'm gonna steal your build.

4818
03:13:04,850 --> 03:13:05,230
I'm...

4819
03:13:09,070 --> 03:13:09,670
Okay.

4820
03:13:11,390 --> 03:13:12,630
Oh, he has that.

4821
03:13:14,250 --> 03:13:14,850
Fantasmic.

4822
03:13:15,670 --> 03:13:19,290
The teams have 20 seconds left to turn around the round.

4823
03:13:22,190 --> 03:13:22,750
Okay.

4824
03:13:23,950 --> 03:13:25,230
I don't know what I'm doing.

4825
03:13:26,750 --> 03:13:27,310
Uh...

4826
03:13:27,310 --> 03:13:28,270
I'll put more weapon power.

4827
03:13:28,430 --> 03:13:29,030
Okay, there we go.

4828
03:13:30,750 --> 03:13:31,310
Alright.

4829
03:13:31,710 --> 03:13:32,810
That should be more heals now.

4830
03:13:37,570 --> 03:13:38,130
Alright.

4831
03:13:39,250 --> 03:13:40,250
It's not stealing.

4832
03:13:40,390 --> 03:13:41,410
It's mirror match.

4833
03:13:41,710 --> 03:13:41,990
Yeah!

4834
03:13:42,490 --> 03:13:43,810
I'll mirror match you.

4835
03:13:44,010 --> 03:13:45,410
I couldn't steal this build in time.

4836
03:13:46,910 --> 03:13:48,350
Okay, how do I use my clones?

4837
03:13:50,330 --> 03:13:52,310
Okay, so when do my clones show up?

4838
03:13:57,890 --> 03:13:58,990
Guys, how do I steal...

4839
03:14:00,910 --> 03:14:02,110
So how do I...

4840
03:14:02,110 --> 03:14:03,050
When I teleport?

4841
03:14:03,250 --> 03:14:04,070
Oh, when I teleport.

4842
03:14:04,310 --> 03:14:04,510
Okay.

4843
03:14:05,730 --> 03:14:06,990
Okay, that makes sense, actually.

4844
03:14:11,170 --> 03:14:11,750
Don't worry!

4845
03:14:12,030 --> 03:14:12,350
TP!

4846
03:14:12,350 --> 03:14:12,470
TP!

4847
03:14:12,610 --> 03:14:13,330
There's two of us!

4848
03:14:13,510 --> 03:14:14,490
What can you do now?

4849
03:14:15,810 --> 03:14:16,490
There you go!

4850
03:14:18,130 --> 03:14:19,030
There's two of us!

4851
03:14:22,210 --> 03:14:23,110
Protect the Rhyme!

4852
03:14:23,210 --> 03:14:23,810
Win the game!

4853
03:14:24,050 --> 03:14:24,710
Save the Rhyme!

4854
03:14:24,870 --> 03:14:25,430
Save the game!

4855
03:14:27,130 --> 03:14:28,010
Tootie, two of me!

4856
03:14:29,970 --> 03:14:31,390
Oh my god, this is actually the strat.

4857
03:14:31,810 --> 03:14:32,130
Here we go.

4858
03:14:32,970 --> 03:14:33,550
Here we go.

4859
03:14:41,040 --> 03:14:41,580
Don't worry!

4860
03:14:41,580 --> 03:14:43,440
I have to reload, but don't worry!

4861
03:14:45,300 --> 03:14:46,580
I have to reload, but don't worry!

4862
03:14:47,780 --> 03:14:48,620
Know what I'll do?

4863
03:14:49,200 --> 03:14:50,000
Two of me!

4864
03:14:50,920 --> 03:14:52,680
I might have wasted that, but that's okay.

4865
03:14:54,940 --> 03:14:55,900
There's two of me though!

4866
03:14:56,620 --> 03:14:57,460
There's two of me!

4867
03:15:04,240 --> 03:15:06,380
I had to do that so I can...

4868
03:15:06,380 --> 03:15:08,680
I had to TP so there's two of me!

4869
03:15:12,020 --> 03:15:14,380
Okay, we need to get your cooldown reduction for it.

4870
03:15:16,880 --> 03:15:17,780
I'll do that.

4871
03:15:17,780 --> 03:15:19,360
One, she's second to none!

4872
03:15:19,940 --> 03:15:20,860
Oh my god!

4873
03:15:23,760 --> 03:15:25,680
This is bronze, you know.

4874
03:15:29,120 --> 03:15:30,500
I'll heal myself.

4875
03:15:32,340 --> 03:15:33,800
I'll heal myself.

4876
03:15:36,540 --> 03:15:37,900
The Rhyme's still alive, you're right!

4877
03:15:39,660 --> 03:15:40,680
You're right, the Rhyme...

4878
03:15:40,680 --> 03:15:42,620
I don't like the X that shows up on my screen.

4879
03:15:42,740 --> 03:15:43,980
I don't even know that I missed.

4880
03:15:44,400 --> 03:15:45,420
Like, that I would...

4881
03:15:45,420 --> 03:15:47,160
Not missed, but I don't even know that I can't hit that.

4882
03:15:47,900 --> 03:15:49,780
Like, I think that's like useless info.

4883
03:15:51,400 --> 03:15:51,720
Okay.

4884
03:15:54,400 --> 03:15:55,040
That's fine.

4885
03:15:59,060 --> 03:16:00,920
Soldier, I need to know what are you doing.

4886
03:16:01,400 --> 03:16:01,800
What?

4887
03:16:03,940 --> 03:16:04,700
Help him!

4888
03:16:05,660 --> 03:16:08,100
Why is that bob so tiny?

4889
03:16:08,100 --> 03:16:08,860
Why?

4890
03:16:13,180 --> 03:16:15,760
Why is that such a tiny bob?

4891
03:16:19,300 --> 03:16:20,040
Don't worry!

4892
03:16:20,440 --> 03:16:21,700
There's two of me now!

4893
03:16:26,050 --> 03:16:27,030
Oh my god!

4894
03:16:27,310 --> 03:16:28,590
That out heals...

4895
03:16:28,590 --> 03:16:29,690
That does not heal me.

4896
03:16:30,510 --> 03:16:31,050
That...

4897
03:16:32,370 --> 03:16:34,030
He's average size.

4898
03:16:34,210 --> 03:16:35,030
What do you mean?

4899
03:16:38,530 --> 03:16:39,680
I'm just gonna say...

4900
03:16:40,430 --> 03:16:42,270
The Rhyme did as much as he could.

4901
03:16:42,650 --> 03:16:43,430
The Rhyme...

4902
03:16:44,350 --> 03:16:46,010
The Rhyme...

4903
03:16:46,010 --> 03:16:46,430
The Rhyme...

4904
03:16:46,430 --> 03:16:47,910
Did so much.

4905
03:16:48,690 --> 03:16:50,370
The Rhyme...

4906
03:16:50,370 --> 03:16:50,990
The Rhyme...

4907
03:16:50,990 --> 03:16:51,570
The Rhyme...

4908
03:16:51,570 --> 03:16:51,830
What do you mean?

4909
03:16:51,870 --> 03:16:53,470
No DPS intake!

4910
03:16:53,790 --> 03:16:56,650
Our Rhyme was actually like...

4911
03:16:56,650 --> 03:16:57,790
The best player!

4912
03:16:58,270 --> 03:16:59,950
Our Rhyme...

4913
03:16:59,950 --> 03:17:03,370
Our Rhyme did so much for us!

4914
03:17:07,930 --> 03:17:09,270
The Rhyme check!

4915
03:17:09,510 --> 03:17:09,850
The Rhyme check!

4916
03:17:09,850 --> 03:17:11,350
Of course they say that!

4917
03:17:11,870 --> 03:17:12,370
Bro!

4918
03:17:12,630 --> 03:17:13,970
What do you mean?

4919
03:17:14,490 --> 03:17:15,710
Alright, let's do another Juno.

4920
03:17:15,790 --> 03:17:17,730
We'll do another Juno and I wanna try an Ana build.

4921
03:17:18,430 --> 03:17:19,960
The least delusional Juno!

4922
03:17:20,650 --> 03:17:23,070
I literally saw a Rhyme and did everything!

4923
03:17:23,070 --> 03:17:23,950
I...

4924
03:17:23,950 --> 03:17:25,050
I...

4925
03:17:25,050 --> 03:17:26,030
I don't know how I did...

4926
03:17:26,030 --> 03:17:27,530
I can't believe blame their tank!

4927
03:17:28,390 --> 03:17:29,750
Here's the bathroom right back.

4928
03:18:22,950 --> 03:18:23,950
And I'm back.

4929
03:18:24,110 --> 03:18:25,710
I'm having fun with Stadium though.

4930
03:18:26,030 --> 03:18:30,010
I think Stadium is very interesting because it feels...

4931
03:18:30,310 --> 03:18:30,610
Faster.

4932
03:18:31,030 --> 03:18:33,550
It's a lot faster than...

4933
03:18:35,090 --> 03:18:35,610
Um...

4934
03:18:35,610 --> 03:18:37,550
It's a lot faster than...

4935
03:18:39,730 --> 03:18:40,250
Uh...

4936
03:18:40,950 --> 03:18:41,470
Than...

4937
03:18:41,470 --> 03:18:41,750
Um...

4938
03:18:41,750 --> 03:18:42,690
Regular matches.

4939
03:18:42,970 --> 03:18:43,450
And like...

4940
03:18:43,450 --> 03:18:45,350
It definitely feels like it could turn around.

4941
03:18:45,490 --> 03:18:46,730
Yeah, the builds are interesting.

4942
03:18:46,990 --> 03:18:47,290
I...

4943
03:18:47,290 --> 03:18:47,690
I...

4944
03:18:47,690 --> 03:18:48,170
I agree.

4945
03:18:48,530 --> 03:18:48,950
Alright.

4946
03:18:49,270 --> 03:18:50,270
It's time to practice.

4947
03:18:50,670 --> 03:18:51,850
Alright, so...

4948
03:18:51,850 --> 03:18:52,430
What do I...

4949
03:18:52,430 --> 03:18:53,010
Do I just get...

4950
03:18:53,010 --> 03:18:54,270
Do I just follow this entire build?

4951
03:18:56,170 --> 03:18:57,590
Alright, what do I build?

4952
03:18:57,750 --> 03:18:59,410
What is the best build for Juno?

4953
03:19:00,730 --> 03:19:01,250
I...

4954
03:19:01,250 --> 03:19:02,030
I tried to...

4955
03:19:02,030 --> 03:19:02,510
I think I...

4956
03:19:02,510 --> 03:19:03,570
What was the other build?

4957
03:19:08,150 --> 03:19:09,370
Okay, so what do we do?

4958
03:19:11,030 --> 03:19:11,810
Guide me.

4959
03:19:12,050 --> 03:19:13,150
What is like the most...

4960
03:19:13,150 --> 03:19:15,050
The strongest build you can do for Juno?

4961
03:19:16,630 --> 03:19:18,010
Just ability max?

4962
03:19:19,710 --> 03:19:20,970
Like, what do I do?

4963
03:19:21,150 --> 03:19:22,430
All ability power?

4964
03:19:24,450 --> 03:19:24,970
So...

4965
03:19:26,130 --> 03:19:27,150
Ability power.

4966
03:19:27,350 --> 03:19:28,330
Ability power.

4967
03:19:34,090 --> 03:19:35,050
Ability power.

4968
03:19:35,290 --> 03:19:36,130
Ability power.

4969
03:19:36,590 --> 03:19:37,410
Ability power.

4970
03:19:37,410 --> 03:19:37,470
Ability power.

4971
03:19:39,690 --> 03:19:40,250
Ability...

4972
03:19:40,250 --> 03:19:40,630
Ability...

4973
03:19:40,630 --> 03:19:41,210
Cooldown redu...

4974
03:19:41,210 --> 03:19:42,470
Okay, where's cooldown reduction?

4975
03:19:44,230 --> 03:19:45,350
Cooldown reduction...

4976
03:19:45,350 --> 03:19:46,350
Where would that be?

4977
03:19:53,510 --> 03:19:55,870
Bottom, middle, blue, inability...

4978
03:19:56,390 --> 03:19:57,210
This one?

4979
03:19:59,090 --> 03:19:59,930
Which one?

4980
03:20:04,580 --> 03:20:05,760
The rare, yellow...

4981
03:20:05,760 --> 03:20:06,140
This one?

4982
03:20:07,800 --> 03:20:08,800
Lock on shield?

4983
03:20:10,980 --> 03:20:12,280
So we got this.

4984
03:20:12,980 --> 03:20:13,060
So we got this.

4985
03:20:15,810 --> 03:20:17,510
Which one's the cooldown reduction?

4986
03:20:20,840 --> 03:20:21,920
Which one does...

4987
03:20:21,920 --> 03:20:23,460
Which one's cooldown reduction, guys?

4988
03:20:30,340 --> 03:20:31,460
Reduction, ironize...

4989
03:20:31,460 --> 03:20:32,960
Oh my god, there's so much thing.

4990
03:20:33,400 --> 03:20:34,460
Middle, right?

4991
03:20:36,340 --> 03:20:36,900
Well...

4992
03:20:36,900 --> 03:20:37,360
Oh, there you go.

4993
03:20:37,600 --> 03:20:38,460
Cooldown reduction.

4994
03:20:38,460 --> 03:20:39,820
Okay, so...

4995
03:20:41,360 --> 03:20:42,760
Okay...

4996
03:20:42,760 --> 03:20:44,520
This says cooldown reduction...

4997
03:20:44,520 --> 03:20:45,860
Cooldown reduction...

4998
03:20:45,900 --> 03:20:47,520
5%, 15%.

4999
03:20:47,520 --> 03:20:48,420
Okay...

5000
03:20:48,420 --> 03:20:49,440
How strong is this?

5001
03:20:57,460 --> 03:20:58,180
Okay...

5002
03:20:58,180 --> 03:20:59,840
I understand...

5003
03:21:04,140 --> 03:21:05,540
I understand...

5004
03:21:07,640 --> 03:21:08,320
Holy...

5005
03:21:12,100 --> 03:21:14,080
Okay, that's a lot of damage.

5006
03:21:16,400 --> 03:21:17,460
That's a lot.

5007
03:21:18,740 --> 03:21:21,160
Okay, so when I start off...

5008
03:21:23,860 --> 03:21:24,540
Jesus...

5009
03:21:24,540 --> 03:21:26,260
Oh my god...

5010
03:21:26,260 --> 03:21:28,120
Oh my god...

5011
03:21:28,120 --> 03:21:28,720
Okay...

5012
03:21:28,720 --> 03:21:29,520
Alright...

5013
03:21:29,520 --> 03:21:31,060
So if I do...

5014
03:21:31,060 --> 03:21:32,360
Oh, I got 4 tributes.

5015
03:21:32,460 --> 03:21:33,260
Do I get 4 tributes?

5016
03:21:34,820 --> 03:21:36,180
Okay, so...

5017
03:21:38,300 --> 03:21:39,480
Where it is...

5018
03:21:39,480 --> 03:21:40,500
Alright, so...

5019
03:21:41,740 --> 03:21:42,820
If I...

5020
03:21:42,820 --> 03:21:43,520
Don't have...

5021
03:21:44,130 --> 03:21:44,400
The...

5022
03:21:44,400 --> 03:21:45,320
Okay, so...

5023
03:21:45,320 --> 03:21:46,140
I'm clearly...

5024
03:21:46,140 --> 03:21:47,100
I'm spamming these.

5025
03:21:47,780 --> 03:21:49,380
Okay, so I need to get yellow.

5026
03:21:50,000 --> 03:21:50,380
And then...

5027
03:21:50,380 --> 03:21:51,540
God, this is like a spreadsheet.

5028
03:21:51,780 --> 03:21:53,320
Okay, ability power...

5029
03:21:53,320 --> 03:21:54,980
Do I need lifesteal?

5030
03:21:55,080 --> 03:21:55,460
Or...

5031
03:21:55,460 --> 03:21:56,140
Does it matter?

5032
03:21:56,340 --> 03:21:58,080
Do I just focus on ability power?

5033
03:21:59,260 --> 03:22:00,020
Cause like...

5034
03:22:00,020 --> 03:22:00,700
What do I...

5035
03:22:00,700 --> 03:22:03,220
Should I just focus all on ability power then?

5036
03:22:03,260 --> 03:22:03,640
Or...

5037
03:22:03,640 --> 03:22:04,780
Should I...

5038
03:22:06,060 --> 03:22:07,140
No lifesteal?

5039
03:22:07,140 --> 03:22:07,640
Lifesteal?

5040
03:22:07,800 --> 03:22:08,340
It doesn't matter?

5041
03:22:08,900 --> 03:22:10,140
Okay, so...

5042
03:22:13,200 --> 03:22:14,160
Overheal ability...

5043
03:22:14,160 --> 03:22:15,060
No lifesteal.

5044
03:22:15,200 --> 03:22:16,120
Okay, so...

5045
03:22:16,120 --> 03:22:18,340
When we start off round 1...

5046
03:22:18,340 --> 03:22:20,300
How much money do you get for round 1?

5047
03:22:22,680 --> 03:22:23,940
I can't afford that.

5048
03:22:29,200 --> 03:22:30,160
3.5k?

5049
03:22:31,240 --> 03:22:32,200
Okay, so...

5050
03:22:32,200 --> 03:22:33,500
I can't afford...

5051
03:22:33,500 --> 03:22:34,600
Okay, not enough for the yellow.

5052
03:22:34,820 --> 03:22:35,500
So what do we...

5053
03:22:35,500 --> 03:22:36,020
Buy...

5054
03:22:36,020 --> 03:22:37,380
What do we buy then?

5055
03:22:37,380 --> 03:22:38,760
We got armor?

5056
03:22:39,480 --> 03:22:42,100
We should...

5057
03:22:42,100 --> 03:22:43,800
Ability power and...

5058
03:22:44,080 --> 03:22:44,920
Cooldown reduction.

5059
03:22:45,360 --> 03:22:46,440
Okay, cooldown reduction.

5060
03:22:46,760 --> 03:22:47,840
Where is cooldown reduction?

5061
03:22:48,960 --> 03:22:49,980
3,000.

5062
03:22:50,140 --> 03:22:50,640
Do we have...

5063
03:22:50,640 --> 03:22:52,760
I don't think we can afford cooldown reduction though.

5064
03:22:55,020 --> 03:22:56,780
Yeah, but like...

5065
03:22:56,780 --> 03:22:58,020
Starting off...

5066
03:22:58,020 --> 03:22:58,540
We don't...

5067
03:22:58,540 --> 03:23:00,220
We can't afford cooldown reduction.

5068
03:23:02,700 --> 03:23:04,840
Attack speed and weapon power.

5069
03:23:05,080 --> 03:23:06,140
Okay, so...

5070
03:23:06,140 --> 03:23:07,380
We can just do...

5071
03:23:08,960 --> 03:23:10,180
This and this.

5072
03:23:11,400 --> 03:23:12,960
So then we have that.

5073
03:23:13,300 --> 03:23:14,800
And then we'll start out with these three.

5074
03:23:15,160 --> 03:23:16,240
And then...

5075
03:23:16,240 --> 03:23:16,880
After...

5076
03:23:16,880 --> 03:23:20,360
Okay, so we'll start out with attack power and weapon power and...

5077
03:23:21,900 --> 03:23:22,540
Alright.

5078
03:23:23,420 --> 03:23:24,700
Let's start with that.

5079
03:23:25,660 --> 03:23:26,280
Holy shit.

5080
03:23:26,400 --> 03:23:27,480
This gets complicated.

5081
03:23:27,720 --> 03:23:28,080
I'm...

5082
03:23:29,440 --> 03:23:30,540
This is like...

5083
03:23:30,540 --> 03:23:31,400
It's like MOBA...

5084
03:23:31,400 --> 03:23:33,280
Like I said, it's like a MOBA and hero shooter.

5085
03:23:33,320 --> 03:23:34,460
So it gets like...

5086
03:23:34,460 --> 03:23:35,160
Complicated.

5087
03:23:35,760 --> 03:23:37,400
I get in first cause I...

5088
03:23:40,360 --> 03:23:41,480
Cause I'm on an SSD.

5089
03:23:41,820 --> 03:23:42,620
I have a better PC.

5090
03:23:42,920 --> 03:23:43,880
So I get to pick first.

5091
03:23:44,060 --> 03:23:44,400
I think...

5092
03:23:44,400 --> 03:23:48,800
I'm pretty sure in Rookie Lobby, I would be the only person with the best PC in...

5093
03:23:48,800 --> 03:23:52,140
I feel like...

5094
03:23:52,140 --> 03:23:55,420
In these Rookie Lobbies, I'd definitely be the...

5095
03:23:55,420 --> 03:23:57,580
One person with the best PC in my team.

5096
03:24:00,240 --> 03:24:01,300
Wait, chat.

5097
03:24:02,040 --> 03:24:02,600
Um...

5098
03:24:02,600 --> 03:24:04,140
I play video games for a living.

5099
03:24:12,220 --> 03:24:12,780
Alright.

5100
03:24:13,300 --> 03:24:13,860
So...

5101
03:24:13,860 --> 03:24:15,440
We'll go with attack speed.

5102
03:24:17,220 --> 03:24:17,800
Uh...

5103
03:24:17,800 --> 03:24:19,380
We'll go with attack speed.

5104
03:24:19,940 --> 03:24:20,520
And...

5105
03:24:20,520 --> 03:24:21,020
Attack power.

5106
03:24:22,660 --> 03:24:23,240
And...

5107
03:24:23,240 --> 03:24:24,220
And...

5108
03:24:24,220 --> 03:24:24,840
What was it?

5109
03:24:24,900 --> 03:24:25,640
Ability power.

5110
03:24:27,320 --> 03:24:27,900
Okay.

5111
03:24:28,480 --> 03:24:29,060
Okay.

5112
03:24:29,180 --> 03:24:29,820
They have Mora.

5113
03:24:30,020 --> 03:24:30,180
Okay.

5114
03:24:30,260 --> 03:24:30,700
That's good.

5115
03:24:30,720 --> 03:24:31,720
I'm on meta.

5116
03:24:32,080 --> 03:24:32,820
I play meta.

5117
03:24:33,580 --> 03:24:34,160
Alright.

5118
03:24:34,220 --> 03:24:35,020
Then we'll do...

5119
03:24:35,020 --> 03:24:35,480
Torpedo.

5120
03:24:36,080 --> 03:24:36,660
Charge.

5121
03:24:37,960 --> 03:24:39,000
Ability power.

5122
03:24:40,100 --> 03:24:40,880
These three.

5123
03:24:41,060 --> 03:24:41,240
Okay.

5124
03:24:41,340 --> 03:24:42,120
And then after that...

5125
03:24:42,120 --> 03:24:42,240
Alright.

5126
03:24:42,320 --> 03:24:42,920
Let's talk about...

5127
03:24:42,920 --> 03:24:43,480
Next one.

5128
03:24:43,840 --> 03:24:44,640
So we focus on...

5129
03:24:44,640 --> 03:24:45,440
Ability power.

5130
03:24:45,680 --> 03:24:46,000
After that.

5131
03:24:46,200 --> 03:24:47,540
So we'll do 10%.

5132
03:24:47,540 --> 03:24:48,840
When aiming game.

5133
03:24:49,020 --> 03:24:49,320
Overheal.

5134
03:24:49,420 --> 03:24:50,000
So we do...

5135
03:24:50,000 --> 03:24:50,940
Overheal.

5136
03:24:51,160 --> 03:24:51,400
Wait.

5137
03:24:51,580 --> 03:24:52,380
We'll do...

5138
03:24:52,380 --> 03:24:53,260
Should we focus on...

5139
03:24:53,260 --> 03:24:53,940
We'll get the yellow.

5140
03:24:54,260 --> 03:24:54,640
After.

5141
03:24:55,420 --> 03:24:56,520
And then we'll sell...

5142
03:24:56,520 --> 03:24:57,180
For the yellow.

5143
03:24:58,320 --> 03:24:59,400
We'll get the yellow.

5144
03:24:59,740 --> 03:25:00,080
And then...

5145
03:25:00,080 --> 03:25:02,180
Focus on ability power here.

5146
03:25:02,880 --> 03:25:03,360
Yeah.

5147
03:25:03,440 --> 03:25:03,860
Round two.

5148
03:25:03,960 --> 03:25:04,120
Yellow.

5149
03:25:04,120 --> 03:25:05,340
Alright guys.

5150
03:25:05,640 --> 03:25:06,360
We're thinking.

5151
03:25:06,760 --> 03:25:06,880
Guys.

5152
03:25:07,040 --> 03:25:07,460
We're thinking.

5153
03:25:10,880 --> 03:25:11,980
Multi-tool.

5154
03:25:12,160 --> 03:25:13,880
What the heck is multi-tool?

5155
03:25:14,620 --> 03:25:15,700
Multi-tool?

5156
03:25:16,760 --> 03:25:18,260
What's multi-tool?

5157
03:25:18,920 --> 03:25:19,440
Guys.

5158
03:25:19,640 --> 03:25:20,180
Where is...

5159
03:25:20,180 --> 03:25:21,120
Guys.

5160
03:25:21,880 --> 03:25:22,820
You gotta be like...

5161
03:25:22,820 --> 03:25:23,360
Blue middle.

5162
03:25:24,740 --> 03:25:25,540
Blue...

5163
03:25:26,120 --> 03:25:26,700
Blue...

5164
03:25:26,700 --> 03:25:27,820
First line...

5165
03:25:27,820 --> 03:25:28,880
First row...

5166
03:25:28,880 --> 03:25:29,400
Middle.

5167
03:25:29,400 --> 03:25:29,640
Middle.

5168
03:25:29,640 --> 03:25:30,040
Or something.

5169
03:25:30,680 --> 03:25:31,300
Ha ha ha ha.

5170
03:25:31,700 --> 03:25:31,940
Yeah.

5171
03:25:32,380 --> 03:25:32,760
Yeah.

5172
03:25:33,320 --> 03:25:35,100
You gotta be specific.

5173
03:25:36,080 --> 03:25:36,560
Green.

5174
03:25:36,900 --> 03:25:37,380
Middle.

5175
03:25:37,800 --> 03:25:37,840
Row.

5176
03:25:38,660 --> 03:25:39,140
Two.

5177
03:25:39,520 --> 03:25:40,060
Or something.

5178
03:25:40,580 --> 03:25:41,760
Ha ha ha ha.

5179
03:25:42,560 --> 03:25:43,380
You can't...

5180
03:25:43,380 --> 03:25:44,340
You can't be like...

5181
03:25:44,340 --> 03:25:45,520
Multi-tool.

5182
03:25:46,020 --> 03:25:46,180
Ha ha ha.

5183
03:25:46,840 --> 03:25:47,320
Middle.

5184
03:25:47,600 --> 03:25:47,760
Right.

5185
03:25:48,100 --> 03:25:48,580
And the blue.

5186
03:25:48,700 --> 03:25:48,840
Okay.

5187
03:25:49,020 --> 03:25:49,280
Middle.

5188
03:25:49,540 --> 03:25:49,580
Right.

5189
03:25:49,700 --> 03:25:49,940
And up.

5190
03:25:50,060 --> 03:25:50,620
There you go.

5191
03:25:51,060 --> 03:25:51,380
Middle.

5192
03:25:51,740 --> 03:25:52,120
Left.

5193
03:25:52,300 --> 03:25:52,460
Right.

5194
03:25:52,700 --> 03:25:52,820
Middle.

5195
03:25:52,940 --> 03:25:53,200
There you go.

5196
03:25:59,400 --> 03:26:00,960
You just suck my battleship.

5197
03:26:02,140 --> 03:26:02,600
Okay.

5198
03:26:02,780 --> 03:26:03,340
Blue middle.

5199
03:26:03,620 --> 03:26:03,740
Row.

5200
03:26:04,060 --> 03:26:04,200
Right.

5201
03:26:06,560 --> 03:26:07,020
Kick.

5202
03:26:07,540 --> 03:26:08,000
Kick.

5203
03:26:08,440 --> 03:26:08,900
Kick.

5204
03:26:09,080 --> 03:26:11,000
I need to be more like in the air as Juno.

5205
03:26:11,480 --> 03:26:13,300
It's been a while since I played Juno in general.

5206
03:26:15,260 --> 03:26:15,720
Phew.

5207
03:26:18,280 --> 03:26:18,740
Alright.

5208
03:26:27,040 --> 03:26:27,940
I hope...

5209
03:26:27,940 --> 03:26:28,340
Okay good.

5210
03:26:28,460 --> 03:26:29,080
I was gonna say it.

5211
03:26:33,910 --> 03:26:34,410
Okay.

5212
03:26:35,410 --> 03:26:35,910
Okay.

5213
03:26:36,330 --> 03:26:36,950
You gotta win.

5214
03:26:40,350 --> 03:26:40,850
Okay.

5215
03:26:43,230 --> 03:26:43,950
That's fine.

5216
03:26:44,410 --> 03:26:45,130
Does this help?

5217
03:26:47,110 --> 03:26:47,930
Oh my god.

5218
03:26:48,030 --> 03:26:48,630
This is not fair.

5219
03:26:48,790 --> 03:26:49,450
He has a shield.

5220
03:26:51,590 --> 03:26:52,590
That's not fair.

5221
03:26:52,590 --> 03:26:52,610
There.

5222
03:26:55,030 --> 03:26:55,810
Oh no.

5223
03:26:56,070 --> 03:26:56,290
No.

5224
03:26:57,070 --> 03:26:58,410
I want to get that escape.

5225
03:26:59,730 --> 03:27:00,330
No.

5226
03:27:01,250 --> 03:27:01,930
I want to get that escape.

5227
03:27:02,470 --> 03:27:03,070
Oh.

5228
03:27:03,170 --> 03:27:04,150
Could he get pissed?

5229
03:27:06,820 --> 03:27:08,220
Oh my god.

5230
03:27:08,640 --> 03:27:08,860
Alright.

5231
03:27:09,000 --> 03:27:09,340
Goodbye.

5232
03:27:09,940 --> 03:27:10,540
Goodbye.

5233
03:27:11,680 --> 03:27:12,740
Hello everybody.

5234
03:27:14,180 --> 03:27:14,480
Hi.

5235
03:27:15,480 --> 03:27:16,520
Dr. Nick.

5236
03:27:17,620 --> 03:27:19,240
I'm gonna grab my E too.

5237
03:27:22,960 --> 03:27:23,640
There.

5238
03:27:25,320 --> 03:27:27,060
I'm using more as a DPS.

5239
03:27:27,960 --> 03:27:28,640
What?

5240
03:27:29,440 --> 03:27:30,120
How?

5241
03:27:30,320 --> 03:27:30,960
What was that?

5242
03:27:31,420 --> 03:27:33,240
What the?

5243
03:27:33,460 --> 03:27:35,260
What was that damage?

5244
03:27:42,880 --> 03:27:43,320
Nice.

5245
03:27:43,800 --> 03:27:44,500
Oh my god.

5246
03:27:45,340 --> 03:27:46,700
What are you doing?

5247
03:27:46,700 --> 03:27:46,800
What are you doing?

5248
03:27:49,540 --> 03:27:51,320
Oh, he's so low.

5249
03:27:52,100 --> 03:27:52,880
I'm sad.

5250
03:27:53,080 --> 03:27:54,460
I almost got her too.

5251
03:27:58,040 --> 03:27:59,600
I'm a little scared here.

5252
03:28:02,740 --> 03:28:03,380
Alright.

5253
03:28:03,600 --> 03:28:05,320
Hey, I got damage on the shield though.

5254
03:28:09,440 --> 03:28:10,080
Oh.

5255
03:28:10,420 --> 03:28:10,800
No.

5256
03:28:11,620 --> 03:28:11,940
Okay.

5257
03:28:12,120 --> 03:28:12,860
No way!

5258
03:28:13,180 --> 03:28:14,020
It got me!

5259
03:28:15,520 --> 03:28:16,960
I was so far.

5260
03:28:17,040 --> 03:28:17,840
It curved?

5261
03:28:18,240 --> 03:28:19,380
How did it curve?

5262
03:28:19,860 --> 03:28:21,060
Oh, she went forward.

5263
03:28:21,880 --> 03:28:23,100
That's how she curved.

5264
03:28:25,080 --> 03:28:27,040
She- I was like, how did it curve?

5265
03:28:27,320 --> 03:28:29,140
Oh, she just like walked to it like that.

5266
03:28:33,680 --> 03:28:34,120
Okay.

5267
03:28:38,240 --> 03:28:40,000
Yeah, I was gonna say that should kill him.

5268
03:28:43,380 --> 03:28:43,820
Nice.

5269
03:28:45,140 --> 03:28:45,580
Go.

5270
03:28:45,960 --> 03:28:46,400
Go fast.

5271
03:28:47,940 --> 03:28:48,800
Go fast.

5272
03:28:48,940 --> 03:28:48,980
Go fast.

5273
03:28:48,980 --> 03:28:49,580
He's so low.

5274
03:28:49,920 --> 03:28:50,180
Please.

5275
03:28:50,640 --> 03:28:51,120
Please.

5276
03:28:54,730 --> 03:28:55,310
Please.

5277
03:28:57,170 --> 03:28:58,070
Oh my god.

5278
03:28:58,250 --> 03:28:58,550
Please.

5279
03:29:02,030 --> 03:29:03,050
Go in there.

5280
03:29:07,540 --> 03:29:08,340
Oh no.

5281
03:29:11,220 --> 03:29:12,180
Oh my god.

5282
03:29:20,550 --> 03:29:22,350
they just have better builds!

5283
03:29:22,490 --> 03:29:23,290
What can I say?

5284
03:29:26,440 --> 03:29:26,780
No!

5285
03:29:26,960 --> 03:29:31,500
I'm getting- I'm trying to get healed as much as I can from this but it's very difficult because there is a lot of damage.

5286
03:29:32,020 --> 03:29:32,740
Oh my god.

5287
03:29:32,920 --> 03:29:34,260
There is so much damage.

5288
03:29:37,560 --> 03:29:40,640
Jesus, I don't know how I'm alive but here I am.

5289
03:29:47,400 --> 03:29:51,600
I'm trying my best with the team I have.

5290
03:29:52,100 --> 03:29:55,960
I bought so much time.

5291
03:29:58,960 --> 03:30:01,160
I'm just bending the beans.

5292
03:30:03,240 --> 03:30:04,760
I bought time though.

5293
03:30:10,830 --> 03:30:14,130
That was, you know, it was a good effort.

5294
03:30:15,330 --> 03:30:18,770
I did my best.

5295
03:30:18,970 --> 03:30:20,450
I did what I could.

5296
03:30:21,170 --> 03:30:22,810
Alright, so lock on shield.

5297
03:30:23,450 --> 03:30:26,410
And then we get multi-tool.

5298
03:30:26,610 --> 03:30:27,770
Okay, we can afford multi-tool.

5299
03:30:27,890 --> 03:30:28,310
That's good.

5300
03:30:28,310 --> 03:30:31,410
Okay, so now we should be a little stronger now.

5301
03:30:32,050 --> 03:30:33,870
At least not MVP.

5302
03:30:34,150 --> 03:30:35,090
I hope not.

5303
03:30:35,630 --> 03:30:40,670
I feel like, oh my god, it would be very embarrassing after that.

5304
03:30:43,410 --> 03:30:45,510
So I got 12k money?

5305
03:30:45,770 --> 03:30:46,850
Was that what I got?

5306
03:30:46,850 --> 03:30:48,370
Wait, is this?

5307
03:30:48,430 --> 03:30:52,350
Is this like the amount of money we got?

5308
03:30:52,670 --> 03:30:53,570
In general?

5309
03:30:54,170 --> 03:30:54,610
From playing?

5310
03:30:55,470 --> 03:30:57,510
So our Ash got more money, right?

5311
03:30:58,270 --> 03:30:59,110
Oh, okay.

5312
03:30:59,350 --> 03:31:01,090
So our Mercy got the least.

5313
03:31:01,270 --> 03:31:01,430
Okay.

5314
03:31:02,310 --> 03:31:03,930
That's right, you better be sorry.

5315
03:31:04,310 --> 03:31:04,650
Whack.

5316
03:31:06,530 --> 03:31:08,250
You better be sorry.

5317
03:31:11,930 --> 03:31:15,070
Alright, at least I know I'm doing my job, guys.

5318
03:31:17,990 --> 03:31:19,890
I'm doing my job, at least.

5319
03:31:22,550 --> 03:31:24,090
I'm doing all I could.

5320
03:31:25,650 --> 03:31:27,590
It's not mean, I'm motivating.

5321
03:31:29,710 --> 03:31:33,150
I think not being able to change heroes is a little scary, though.

5322
03:31:35,450 --> 03:31:36,590
Because it's like...

5323
03:31:37,510 --> 03:31:39,350
I don't know, like...

5324
03:31:39,350 --> 03:31:40,870
You can't do counterplays.

5325
03:31:41,150 --> 03:31:43,370
But I guess, like, the ability is the counterplay?

5326
03:31:43,750 --> 03:31:44,550
Is that it?

5327
03:31:48,090 --> 03:31:50,590
I assume, like, the ability is counterplay, right?

5328
03:31:51,190 --> 03:31:53,330
Also, what the heck is this lab?

5329
03:31:55,130 --> 03:31:56,530
A lot of stuff is scary.

5330
03:32:00,350 --> 03:32:01,510
That's right, run.

5331
03:32:03,930 --> 03:32:05,350
Okay, Mercy, I saw that.

5332
03:32:05,530 --> 03:32:06,590
I saw that, Mercy.

5333
03:32:06,770 --> 03:32:07,390
I saw that.

5334
03:32:12,270 --> 03:32:13,910
Mercy, I saw that, Mercy.

5335
03:32:19,210 --> 03:32:20,210
Oh my god.

5336
03:32:22,070 --> 03:32:25,310
That Mercy shot the reflecting bullets.

5337
03:32:25,850 --> 03:32:26,370
I...

5338
03:32:31,050 --> 03:32:34,190
I saw her shoot the reflecting bullets, guys.

5339
03:32:34,430 --> 03:32:35,190
I saw it.

5340
03:32:36,570 --> 03:32:38,850
And unfortunately, I had to witness it.

5341
03:32:46,770 --> 03:32:47,290
Doink.

5342
03:32:49,810 --> 03:32:50,090
Okay.

5343
03:32:52,170 --> 03:32:53,110
Where are they going?

5344
03:32:53,610 --> 03:32:56,230
I shouldn't have wasted that, but, like, I got curious.

5345
03:33:02,480 --> 03:33:03,690
Where's my cast?

5346
03:33:03,830 --> 03:33:04,410
I was like...

5347
03:33:04,410 --> 03:33:05,190
Where is he?

5348
03:33:09,170 --> 03:33:09,910
Like...

5349
03:33:10,660 --> 03:33:11,950
I'm a little confused.

5350
03:33:12,330 --> 03:33:13,930
Oh my god, okay.

5351
03:33:15,370 --> 03:33:16,030
Oh!

5352
03:33:16,930 --> 03:33:17,450
No!

5353
03:33:17,810 --> 03:33:19,870
Why are you always chasing me?

5354
03:33:19,870 --> 03:33:20,910
Why...

5355
03:33:24,570 --> 03:33:25,350
Why...

5356
03:33:25,350 --> 03:33:25,450
Why...

5357
03:33:25,450 --> 03:33:25,790
Why...

5358
03:33:25,790 --> 03:33:27,970
Why are you always trying to chase me?

5359
03:33:28,870 --> 03:33:30,950
Get away from me!

5360
03:33:44,910 --> 03:33:47,730
Get away from me!

5361
03:33:47,730 --> 03:33:48,270
There we go.

5362
03:33:49,270 --> 03:33:49,610
I'm good.

5363
03:33:49,990 --> 03:33:50,630
I'm good.

5364
03:33:50,790 --> 03:33:51,130
I'm okay.

5365
03:33:51,690 --> 03:33:52,570
You know what?

5366
03:33:53,350 --> 03:33:56,150
That more rents straight at me, Whiffer.

5367
03:33:56,790 --> 03:33:57,270
Whiffer.

5368
03:33:59,170 --> 03:34:00,930
Whiffer, oh, I'm so sad.

5369
03:34:04,370 --> 03:34:05,670
Alright, that's good.

5370
03:34:05,870 --> 03:34:09,090
At least... at least, like, my team is actually being good teammates.

5371
03:34:10,970 --> 03:34:12,950
Okay, now... now I have to think.

5372
03:34:14,130 --> 03:34:15,690
Now I have to figure this out.

5373
03:34:16,250 --> 03:34:21,250
Okay, if I sell... okay, one, two, three, and then I'll have 9,000.

5374
03:34:21,450 --> 03:34:27,910
That's not enough, though, for any of the... I have to get an ability... I guess I can get this one for now.

5375
03:34:28,850 --> 03:34:30,210
I'll get more ability power.

5376
03:34:30,650 --> 03:34:36,410
Yeah, I'll put this, and then I'll sell this and my greens for 40% ability power.

5377
03:34:39,350 --> 03:34:40,850
Did the power coolant?

5378
03:34:42,230 --> 03:34:42,890
Wait.

5379
03:34:44,170 --> 03:34:44,310
Wait.

5380
03:34:44,310 --> 03:34:44,870
Get the power?

5381
03:34:45,150 --> 03:34:46,150
Wait, which one's that?

5382
03:34:47,650 --> 03:34:48,310
Weapon.

5383
03:34:49,170 --> 03:34:49,870
It's in.

5384
03:34:50,770 --> 03:34:52,630
Oh, I forgot to... oh, sorry.

5385
03:34:53,830 --> 03:34:54,070
Um.

5386
03:34:55,530 --> 03:34:57,470
Get the... which one is it?

5387
03:34:58,750 --> 03:35:00,330
Power coolant cosmic.

5388
03:35:01,090 --> 03:35:03,070
Uh, what do I get?

5389
03:35:06,030 --> 03:35:07,170
Which one do I get, guys?

5390
03:35:08,130 --> 03:35:09,110
Guys, which one do I get?

5391
03:35:09,210 --> 03:35:10,030
I have 35 seconds.

5392
03:35:12,230 --> 03:35:13,550
Second to last on the right.

5393
03:35:13,650 --> 03:35:14,350
This one caught...

5394
03:35:15,750 --> 03:35:16,530
Cosmic coolant?

5395
03:35:17,350 --> 03:35:18,170
Cooldown is reduced.

5396
03:35:18,350 --> 03:35:18,530
Okay.

5397
03:35:19,030 --> 03:35:19,510
Look at that.

5398
03:35:20,670 --> 03:35:21,470
Cosmic coolant.

5399
03:35:21,590 --> 03:35:22,070
Let's go.

5400
03:35:23,590 --> 03:35:23,990
Yay!

5401
03:35:25,270 --> 03:35:26,970
20 seconds to go.

5402
03:35:28,390 --> 03:35:29,110
All right.

5403
03:35:31,570 --> 03:35:32,730
Okay, we got this.

5404
03:35:33,090 --> 03:35:34,050
We got this, guys.

5405
03:35:34,290 --> 03:35:35,070
We're one to one.

5406
03:35:35,550 --> 03:35:36,730
We figured it out.

5407
03:35:36,930 --> 03:35:37,890
We're building.

5408
03:35:38,170 --> 03:35:39,150
We're building!

5409
03:35:43,480 --> 03:35:44,540
We've built...

5410
03:35:44,540 --> 03:35:46,300
We have our spreadsheets!

5411
03:35:46,800 --> 03:35:49,040
And the arrows and the diagrams!

5412
03:35:50,680 --> 03:35:51,360
All right.

5413
03:35:54,820 --> 03:35:55,440
All right.

5414
03:35:55,800 --> 03:35:56,240
All right.

5415
03:35:56,240 --> 03:35:56,620
Here we go.

5416
03:35:59,360 --> 03:35:59,800
Wait.

5417
03:36:00,260 --> 03:36:01,300
Did I go the wrong way?

5418
03:36:03,400 --> 03:36:03,840
Whoops.

5419
03:36:05,740 --> 03:36:06,400
My bad.

5420
03:36:07,620 --> 03:36:09,360
I don't know if I went the wrong way or not.

5421
03:36:11,440 --> 03:36:12,300
Oh my god.

5422
03:36:12,860 --> 03:36:13,620
Cass, please.

5423
03:36:15,080 --> 03:36:16,280
Oh my god.

5424
03:36:16,600 --> 03:36:17,400
That was scary.

5425
03:36:17,580 --> 03:36:18,200
But it's okay.

5426
03:36:18,440 --> 03:36:19,200
My team's okay.

5427
03:36:23,020 --> 03:36:24,160
Oh, it reflects.

5428
03:36:27,160 --> 03:36:28,460
Go take that speed!

5429
03:36:28,800 --> 03:36:29,760
Be fast!

5430
03:36:31,860 --> 03:36:32,860
Okay, nice.

5431
03:36:35,360 --> 03:36:36,600
Nice, we got mercy.

5432
03:36:38,120 --> 03:36:38,720
Nice.

5433
03:36:39,580 --> 03:36:40,380
What is he gonna do?

5434
03:36:40,500 --> 03:36:40,800
Nothing!

5435
03:36:42,040 --> 03:36:42,800
Oh, wait.

5436
03:36:42,960 --> 03:36:43,500
What is our...

5437
03:36:43,500 --> 03:36:43,880
Don't worry.

5438
03:36:43,980 --> 03:36:44,260
I got you.

5439
03:36:44,320 --> 03:36:44,840
I got you!

5440
03:36:45,740 --> 03:36:46,480
That's right.

5441
03:36:46,500 --> 03:36:47,880
You can't bend this now!

5442
03:36:48,220 --> 03:36:48,720
Ow.

5443
03:36:53,040 --> 03:36:53,720
No!

5444
03:36:54,080 --> 03:36:54,280
Live.

5445
03:36:54,560 --> 03:36:55,020
No!

5446
03:36:58,780 --> 03:37:00,580
Oh my god, I need...

5447
03:37:01,560 --> 03:37:02,240
Please.

5448
03:37:02,600 --> 03:37:03,040
Please.

5449
03:37:03,360 --> 03:37:03,740
Mercy.

5450
03:37:04,140 --> 03:37:04,520
Please.

5451
03:37:04,720 --> 03:37:05,280
I'm right here.

5452
03:37:08,640 --> 03:37:09,740
Nice, we got it.

5453
03:37:10,140 --> 03:37:10,400
No!

5454
03:37:16,440 --> 03:37:20,160
The moment I said that, I...

5455
03:37:20,160 --> 03:37:20,640
I'm sad.

5456
03:37:21,060 --> 03:37:21,900
I'm...

5457
03:37:21,900 --> 03:37:22,920
I'm so sad.

5458
03:37:23,160 --> 03:37:27,200
I'm from downtown with the steel chair.

5459
03:37:27,800 --> 03:37:28,380
I...

5460
03:37:28,380 --> 03:37:29,400
I...

5461
03:37:29,400 --> 03:37:33,260
He came out of nowhere with a steel chair.

5462
03:37:33,520 --> 03:37:35,060
It's not fair.

5463
03:37:36,140 --> 03:37:37,960
It's not fair.

5464
03:37:39,220 --> 03:37:40,580
It's not fair.

5465
03:37:42,880 --> 03:37:44,620
Okay, I should've waited a little bit.

5466
03:37:46,700 --> 03:37:48,740
The steel chair out of nowhere.

5467
03:37:53,550 --> 03:37:54,350
Okay, nice.

5468
03:37:57,890 --> 03:37:59,470
All right, that should be enough heals.

5469
03:37:59,930 --> 03:38:01,010
I'm gonna save my ult for now.

5470
03:38:01,330 --> 03:38:02,690
Because I don't think we need it.

5471
03:38:04,470 --> 03:38:04,850
There you go.

5472
03:38:04,850 --> 03:38:06,550
Oh, that Genji was low.

5473
03:38:09,250 --> 03:38:09,950
There you go.

5474
03:38:10,170 --> 03:38:10,490
That's fine.

5475
03:38:11,170 --> 03:38:12,310
I'll just use this for heals.

5476
03:38:18,320 --> 03:38:18,980
That's fine.

5477
03:38:20,380 --> 03:38:21,240
I'll use this.

5478
03:38:24,340 --> 03:38:25,280
Oh, that's good!

5479
03:38:25,380 --> 03:38:26,160
That's a huge ult!

5480
03:38:28,900 --> 03:38:29,560
Oh no.

5481
03:38:29,860 --> 03:38:30,360
Oh no!

5482
03:38:30,580 --> 03:38:32,720
They said use everything, but it's too late!

5483
03:38:32,840 --> 03:38:33,560
We got it!

5484
03:38:38,720 --> 03:38:39,320
Oh!

5485
03:38:39,940 --> 03:38:41,100
Thank God!

5486
03:38:41,400 --> 03:38:43,680
Thank God we have actual DPS!

5487
03:38:44,220 --> 03:38:45,420
Thank God!

5488
03:38:45,880 --> 03:38:47,360
I'm so happy.

5489
03:38:47,780 --> 03:38:49,940
We have real DPS player.

5490
03:38:50,480 --> 03:38:52,620
Our Ashe is actually carrying.

5491
03:38:53,300 --> 03:38:55,160
All right, so we have 8,000.

5492
03:38:55,320 --> 03:38:57,540
So I can get rid of ability power.

5493
03:38:57,920 --> 03:38:58,940
And then I...

5494
03:38:58,940 --> 03:39:00,120
Okay, so I wanna buy...

5495
03:39:00,940 --> 03:39:02,060
Which one was it?

5496
03:39:02,060 --> 03:39:03,280
It was like super strong.

5497
03:39:03,440 --> 03:39:03,740
Oh, this one.

5498
03:39:03,900 --> 03:39:04,680
13,000.

5499
03:39:05,520 --> 03:39:07,020
Okay, I could get rid of...

5500
03:39:08,040 --> 03:39:09,300
Here, attack speed.

5501
03:39:09,640 --> 03:39:10,480
So I can afford...

5502
03:39:10,480 --> 03:39:10,800
Oh wait.

5503
03:39:11,820 --> 03:39:13,680
Oh, I still can't afford it.

5504
03:39:14,600 --> 03:39:15,440
Oh my God.

5505
03:39:15,560 --> 03:39:16,640
I still can't afford it.

5506
03:39:16,800 --> 03:39:17,000
Okay.

5507
03:39:18,960 --> 03:39:19,440
Um...

5508
03:39:19,440 --> 03:39:20,360
If I get...

5509
03:39:20,360 --> 03:39:21,620
I could buy it.

5510
03:39:23,620 --> 03:39:25,120
I already have Nanocola.

5511
03:39:26,180 --> 03:39:27,360
What else can I get?

5512
03:39:31,380 --> 03:39:32,340
50 shields.

5513
03:39:33,200 --> 03:39:34,100
15 percent.

5514
03:39:34,420 --> 03:39:35,540
I could get this one.

5515
03:39:36,180 --> 03:39:37,520
Oh, get rid of Nanocola?

5516
03:39:37,960 --> 03:39:38,820
Okay, and then...

5517
03:39:38,820 --> 03:39:39,520
Oh, I could get that.

5518
03:39:39,640 --> 03:39:40,140
Yeah, you're right.

5519
03:39:40,380 --> 03:39:42,060
And then I'll just put back this.

5520
03:39:43,720 --> 03:39:44,680
And then...

5521
03:39:44,680 --> 03:39:46,040
Only 20 seconds left.

5522
03:39:46,300 --> 03:39:46,780
Uh...

5523
03:39:46,780 --> 03:39:47,220
And I'll...

5524
03:39:47,220 --> 03:39:48,480
I'll keep back these two.

5525
03:39:48,800 --> 03:39:49,520
All right, here we go.

5526
03:39:50,660 --> 03:39:51,180
All right.

5527
03:39:51,600 --> 03:39:53,960
Now we should have more ability power.

5528
03:39:54,520 --> 03:39:55,460
That should be fine.

5529
03:39:58,760 --> 03:39:59,440
There you go.

5530
03:39:59,600 --> 03:40:00,560
Now we have 40 percent.

5531
03:40:01,420 --> 03:40:02,500
And then like...

5532
03:40:02,500 --> 03:40:03,340
If we can afford...

5533
03:40:03,340 --> 03:40:04,500
We afford the 20 percent.

5534
03:40:04,760 --> 03:40:05,240
Oh, I...

5535
03:40:05,240 --> 03:40:05,460
Oops.

5536
03:40:09,340 --> 03:40:10,660
I messed up.

5537
03:40:12,460 --> 03:40:13,040
It's okay.

5538
03:40:13,060 --> 03:40:13,780
We'll do it later.

5539
03:40:14,340 --> 03:40:14,900
It's okay.

5540
03:40:15,060 --> 03:40:15,720
We'll have...

5541
03:40:15,720 --> 03:40:16,740
We'll use it here, guys.

5542
03:40:16,940 --> 03:40:17,320
It's okay.

5543
03:40:17,560 --> 03:40:17,880
It's okay.

5544
03:40:18,800 --> 03:40:19,360
Whoops.

5545
03:40:20,960 --> 03:40:23,180
It does that countdown in my head.

5546
03:40:23,380 --> 03:40:24,740
I feel like it happened.

5547
03:40:24,740 --> 03:40:25,260
You know?

5548
03:40:29,020 --> 03:40:30,640
You know when like...

5549
03:40:30,640 --> 03:40:31,720
The countdown happens.

5550
03:40:31,880 --> 03:40:33,080
And so you think like...

5551
03:40:33,080 --> 03:40:34,340
It's already happened.

5552
03:40:38,570 --> 03:40:39,130
Okay.

5553
03:40:39,790 --> 03:40:40,350
Nice.

5554
03:40:46,680 --> 03:40:47,240
Okay.

5555
03:40:48,060 --> 03:40:48,620
Nice.

5556
03:40:52,660 --> 03:40:53,160
Don't worry.

5557
03:40:53,260 --> 03:40:53,580
I got you.

5558
03:40:55,420 --> 03:40:57,220
I need you to stop standing there though.

5559
03:40:57,300 --> 03:40:57,840
But I got you.

5560
03:41:00,420 --> 03:41:01,340
Oh my god.

5561
03:41:01,500 --> 03:41:03,380
The ability power is working, guys.

5562
03:41:03,860 --> 03:41:05,060
It's working, guys.

5563
03:41:05,470 --> 03:41:06,940
The ability power.

5564
03:41:09,900 --> 03:41:11,360
Oh my god.

5565
03:41:11,940 --> 03:41:13,880
I'm ability power-y.

5566
03:41:14,300 --> 03:41:15,100
Okay, Mercy.

5567
03:41:15,300 --> 03:41:16,020
I see that.

5568
03:41:17,560 --> 03:41:18,220
I...

5569
03:41:20,440 --> 03:41:22,020
Oh, they dodged that.

5570
03:41:22,080 --> 03:41:22,700
That was a good dodge.

5571
03:41:23,280 --> 03:41:23,560
Okay.

5572
03:41:23,700 --> 03:41:24,460
That's on you.

5573
03:41:26,720 --> 03:41:27,000
Okay.

5574
03:41:27,080 --> 03:41:27,840
That's on you too.

5575
03:41:28,000 --> 03:41:28,280
I...

5576
03:41:30,820 --> 03:41:32,220
I don't know what I can do there.

5577
03:41:37,400 --> 03:41:37,680
I...

5578
03:41:38,180 --> 03:41:38,460
Okay.

5579
03:41:41,760 --> 03:41:42,140
Don't worry.

5580
03:41:42,200 --> 03:41:42,800
I got you.

5581
03:41:50,510 --> 03:41:50,970
I'm on it.

5582
03:41:51,030 --> 03:41:51,350
I'm on it.

5583
03:41:51,450 --> 03:41:51,710
I'm on it.

5584
03:41:51,790 --> 03:41:52,130
I'm on it.

5585
03:41:52,190 --> 03:41:52,470
I'm on it.

5586
03:41:52,530 --> 03:41:52,610
I'm on it.

5587
03:41:52,610 --> 03:41:52,710
I'm on it.

5588
03:41:52,810 --> 03:41:53,010
No!

5589
03:42:02,120 --> 03:42:03,480
Are you serious?

5590
03:42:04,080 --> 03:42:06,240
I went on it for us!

5591
03:42:08,920 --> 03:42:10,780
I did it for us!

5592
03:42:13,020 --> 03:42:14,060
Can I even...

5593
03:42:14,060 --> 03:42:14,700
No, I can't.

5594
03:42:15,220 --> 03:42:16,200
I'm so sad.

5595
03:42:17,580 --> 03:42:19,060
I did all of that too.

5596
03:42:21,260 --> 03:42:22,280
I'm so sad.

5597
03:42:22,540 --> 03:42:23,620
Like, I don't know what else I could do.

5598
03:42:27,630 --> 03:42:28,610
Oh my god.

5599
03:42:28,730 --> 03:42:29,050
I don't know.

5600
03:42:29,370 --> 03:42:30,170
I don't know.

5601
03:42:37,920 --> 03:42:38,680
Oh my god.

5602
03:42:38,680 --> 03:42:38,920
Nice.

5603
03:42:42,600 --> 03:42:43,080
Oh.

5604
03:42:47,440 --> 03:42:48,060
Come on.

5605
03:42:48,260 --> 03:42:48,660
She's so low.

5606
03:42:49,480 --> 03:42:49,740
Come on.

5607
03:42:49,820 --> 03:42:50,080
Kill her.

5608
03:42:50,280 --> 03:42:50,660
Yes!

5609
03:42:53,340 --> 03:42:54,320
Oh my god.

5610
03:42:54,380 --> 03:42:54,880
I did it.

5611
03:42:56,420 --> 03:42:57,340
I did it.

5612
03:42:57,540 --> 03:42:58,280
Do it for her.

5613
03:42:58,700 --> 03:42:59,160
Mercy!

5614
03:42:59,500 --> 03:42:59,840
Mercy!

5615
03:43:00,560 --> 03:43:01,040
Mercy!

5616
03:43:01,800 --> 03:43:02,020
Mercy!

5617
03:43:05,500 --> 03:43:06,460
I just...

5618
03:43:09,200 --> 03:43:09,680
Okay.

5619
03:43:10,500 --> 03:43:11,440
You know what?

5620
03:43:11,560 --> 03:43:12,200
It's fine.

5621
03:43:12,660 --> 03:43:13,960
I'm fine with that.

5622
03:43:14,180 --> 03:43:14,420
Oh, wait.

5623
03:43:14,520 --> 03:43:16,760
I have more money than our other DPS.

5624
03:43:16,900 --> 03:43:17,320
Let's go.

5625
03:43:18,680 --> 03:43:19,180
You know what?

5626
03:43:19,240 --> 03:43:20,460
I think I'm doing my part.

5627
03:43:22,520 --> 03:43:23,400
Mercy, please.

5628
03:43:24,160 --> 03:43:26,120
I think I'm doing my part, guys.

5629
03:43:26,280 --> 03:43:28,440
I think I'm playing as well as I can.

5630
03:43:29,860 --> 03:43:30,300
Uh...

5631
03:43:30,300 --> 03:43:30,440
Alright.

5632
03:43:30,680 --> 03:43:31,280
A bit...

5633
03:43:31,280 --> 03:43:32,540
Okay, we're counting 5,000.

5634
03:43:32,780 --> 03:43:33,140
Wait.

5635
03:43:33,160 --> 03:43:33,900
I can afford that.

5636
03:43:34,060 --> 03:43:34,180
Okay.

5637
03:43:34,220 --> 03:43:35,280
We get rid of...

5638
03:43:35,740 --> 03:43:36,480
10 per...

5639
03:43:36,480 --> 03:43:36,700
Okay.

5640
03:43:36,760 --> 03:43:37,380
We keep that.

5641
03:43:37,640 --> 03:43:40,100
Get rid of weapon power.

5642
03:43:41,120 --> 03:43:42,040
And then...

5643
03:43:42,040 --> 03:43:42,740
Put it on...

5644
03:43:43,960 --> 03:43:44,420
Nanocola.

5645
03:43:45,660 --> 03:43:46,580
And then...

5646
03:43:46,580 --> 03:43:48,320
Is there any more ability power I should get?

5647
03:43:49,020 --> 03:43:49,480
Okay.

5648
03:43:49,480 --> 03:43:50,660
That's 20%.

5649
03:43:50,660 --> 03:43:50,900
Okay.

5650
03:43:50,980 --> 03:43:51,800
We should...

5651
03:43:51,800 --> 03:43:52,880
Oh, don't forget.

5652
03:43:52,980 --> 03:43:53,140
Oh, yeah.

5653
03:43:53,200 --> 03:43:53,520
You're right.

5654
03:43:53,980 --> 03:43:54,720
Medicinal missiles.

5655
03:43:54,920 --> 03:43:55,080
Okay.

5656
03:43:55,820 --> 03:43:56,280
Alright.

5657
03:43:56,400 --> 03:43:57,780
And then healing torpedoes.

5658
03:43:57,860 --> 03:43:58,080
Okay.

5659
03:44:01,080 --> 03:44:01,440
Uh...

5660
03:44:02,540 --> 03:44:03,560
What else can I get?

5661
03:44:03,900 --> 03:44:04,260
What else?

5662
03:44:04,300 --> 03:44:05,040
Is this a good build?

5663
03:44:08,360 --> 03:44:09,080
I'm Nanocola.

5664
03:44:09,380 --> 03:44:10,280
I have 5%.

5665
03:44:10,280 --> 03:44:12,540
Should I get rid of attack speed or should I keep it, guys?

5666
03:44:12,860 --> 03:44:15,120
If I get rid of attack speed, I can build...

5667
03:44:15,820 --> 03:44:16,180
Wait.

5668
03:44:16,280 --> 03:44:16,780
I can get...

5669
03:44:16,780 --> 03:44:16,900
No.

5670
03:44:16,960 --> 03:44:18,680
I can get rid of this and get that.

5671
03:44:18,920 --> 03:44:22,000
And then I get 5% ability power and 10%.

5672
03:44:22,500 --> 03:44:24,380
And 10% attack speed.

5673
03:44:25,020 --> 03:44:26,500
Or I could get more ability...

5674
03:44:26,500 --> 03:44:27,280
Okay, 10%.

5675
03:44:27,800 --> 03:44:28,900
I could get this one.

5676
03:44:29,400 --> 03:44:30,080
Hyper ring.

5677
03:44:31,420 --> 03:44:31,940
Or...

5678
03:44:31,940 --> 03:44:33,020
Or I could get...

5679
03:44:33,020 --> 03:44:34,420
Actually, 5%.

5680
03:44:34,420 --> 03:44:36,180
Or do I do this one?

5681
03:44:36,740 --> 03:44:38,240
Or do I do custom stock?

5682
03:44:39,000 --> 03:44:42,340
Should I do wrist wraps, lux loop, or custom shock?

5683
03:44:42,680 --> 03:44:43,360
Or stock?

5684
03:44:43,520 --> 03:44:44,120
Which one do I get?

5685
03:44:44,220 --> 03:44:45,300
Lux loop or...

5686
03:44:47,600 --> 03:44:49,460
No, keep the...

5687
03:44:50,700 --> 03:44:51,960
Oh, keep the attack speed?

5688
03:44:52,060 --> 03:44:52,240
Okay.

5689
03:44:53,260 --> 03:44:53,700
Alright.

5690
03:44:53,760 --> 03:44:54,120
Let's go.

5691
03:44:54,460 --> 03:44:55,420
Guys, I'm think...

5692
03:44:55,420 --> 03:44:55,800
I'm...

5693
03:44:55,800 --> 03:44:56,620
I...

5694
03:44:58,000 --> 03:44:59,600
I'm almost thinking.

5695
03:45:04,560 --> 03:45:05,360
Okay.

5696
03:45:05,960 --> 03:45:06,080
Okay.

5697
03:45:06,940 --> 03:45:08,120
Guys, guys, guys.

5698
03:45:08,560 --> 03:45:09,960
I'm cooking now.

5699
03:45:13,540 --> 03:45:14,920
I'm sorry.

5700
03:45:15,380 --> 03:45:16,400
I'm sorry.

5701
03:45:16,780 --> 03:45:19,920
I don't know why I keep doing it.

5702
03:45:21,320 --> 03:45:23,940
It's just reflex, guys.

5703
03:45:25,600 --> 03:45:27,220
I swear to God.

5704
03:45:29,100 --> 03:45:30,380
It's reflex.

5705
03:45:30,760 --> 03:45:32,080
I can't help it.

5706
03:45:34,060 --> 03:45:35,960
I can't help it, guys.

5707
03:45:36,160 --> 03:45:37,660
I actually can't help it.

5708
03:45:38,860 --> 03:45:39,600
Okay, here.

5709
03:45:40,660 --> 03:45:42,740
It's just like in my nature.

5710
03:45:43,380 --> 03:45:48,620
It's in my nature to hear a countdown and then press my buttons.

5711
03:45:50,020 --> 03:45:54,120
If they did want me to do anything, then they shouldn't have given me a countdown.

5712
03:45:58,180 --> 03:45:59,280
That's all I'm saying.

5713
03:46:01,160 --> 03:46:03,140
That's on them for giving me a countdown.

5714
03:46:08,340 --> 03:46:09,380
Oh, I'm lucky.

5715
03:46:09,600 --> 03:46:09,620
Oh, I'm lucky.

5716
03:46:09,620 --> 03:46:09,940
I want it.

5717
03:46:10,780 --> 03:46:11,960
Oh, my God.

5718
03:46:12,260 --> 03:46:12,880
What the...

5719
03:46:14,240 --> 03:46:15,160
Mercy, please.

5720
03:46:15,340 --> 03:46:16,400
I'm so resable.

5721
03:46:16,820 --> 03:46:18,080
Oh, my God.

5722
03:46:18,520 --> 03:46:19,120
That...

5723
03:46:20,340 --> 03:46:25,080
I need to remember, like, the shit that he can do.

5724
03:46:25,080 --> 03:46:25,300
I...

5725
03:46:26,840 --> 03:46:29,120
What the heck is the damage?

5726
03:46:29,520 --> 03:46:30,940
Oh, my God.

5727
03:46:31,660 --> 03:46:31,900
Wait.

5728
03:46:34,500 --> 03:46:34,920
Why?

5729
03:46:35,160 --> 03:46:35,640
Okay.

5730
03:46:36,580 --> 03:46:39,360
The damage for that is crazy.

5731
03:46:39,720 --> 03:46:40,580
That's my bad.

5732
03:46:41,080 --> 03:46:41,360
That...

5733
03:46:41,360 --> 03:46:43,120
That ride...

5734
03:46:43,120 --> 03:46:43,780
Okay.

5735
03:46:44,020 --> 03:46:48,880
Now I'm, like, ego peeking the ride because I didn't think he'd be that strong.

5736
03:46:50,180 --> 03:46:52,400
The ride's ability power.

5737
03:46:56,150 --> 03:46:57,130
That's right.

5738
03:46:57,470 --> 03:46:57,550
Run.

5739
03:47:01,010 --> 03:47:01,690
Okay.

5740
03:47:01,910 --> 03:47:04,930
That ride's ability power is actually crazy.

5741
03:47:11,870 --> 03:47:12,550
Okay.

5742
03:47:18,930 --> 03:47:19,610
What?

5743
03:47:20,150 --> 03:47:20,830
Where?

5744
03:47:21,150 --> 03:47:21,830
Okay.

5745
03:47:21,950 --> 03:47:22,950
I need to see this.

5746
03:47:26,280 --> 03:47:27,920
I didn't even see...

5747
03:47:27,920 --> 03:47:28,600
Oh, my God.

5748
03:47:28,600 --> 03:47:30,020
He had peeker's advantage.

5749
03:47:30,400 --> 03:47:33,940
He actually had third-person peeker advantage.

5750
03:47:34,140 --> 03:47:36,120
Because I was, like, where did that come from?

5751
03:47:37,400 --> 03:47:39,880
The goddamn peeker's advantage.

5752
03:47:39,880 --> 03:47:41,020
That's what...

5753
03:47:41,600 --> 03:47:45,600
I would say I am not performing as...

5754
03:47:49,610 --> 03:47:50,450
Okay.

5755
03:47:51,350 --> 03:47:53,050
I mean, I might as well.

5756
03:47:53,170 --> 03:47:54,170
It doesn't overlay.

5757
03:47:59,330 --> 03:48:03,090
My ability power is so strong.

5758
03:48:03,610 --> 03:48:04,310
Yeah!

5759
03:48:09,150 --> 03:48:10,150
That's right.

5760
03:48:11,990 --> 03:48:13,130
Ability power!

5761
03:48:13,770 --> 03:48:14,290
Wait.

5762
03:48:14,290 --> 03:48:15,030
I got second.

5763
03:48:15,370 --> 03:48:15,670
Nice.

5764
03:48:16,450 --> 03:48:17,570
I was, um...

5765
03:48:17,570 --> 03:48:18,390
Second best player.

5766
03:48:20,930 --> 03:48:21,490
Wait, no.

5767
03:48:21,630 --> 03:48:21,930
Actually, no.

5768
03:48:21,990 --> 03:48:22,830
I was third best player.

5769
03:48:22,930 --> 03:48:23,230
Never mind.

5770
03:48:23,310 --> 03:48:24,070
I saw our...

5771
03:48:24,650 --> 03:48:25,950
I saw our...

5772
03:48:25,950 --> 03:48:26,810
Our, uh...

5773
03:48:26,810 --> 03:48:27,710
What's his name?

5774
03:48:28,690 --> 03:48:29,810
I forgot her name.

5775
03:48:30,590 --> 03:48:31,390
Slashy Slash.

5776
03:48:33,330 --> 03:48:34,830
Our Ashe was so good, though.

5777
03:48:36,650 --> 03:48:38,450
I was better than one of our DPS.

5778
03:48:38,610 --> 03:48:39,210
I didn't.

5779
03:48:39,210 --> 03:48:39,770
All right.

5780
03:48:40,230 --> 03:48:41,210
Okay, so...

5781
03:48:42,130 --> 03:48:42,950
Oh, nice.

5782
03:48:43,250 --> 03:48:44,150
I got...

5783
03:48:44,150 --> 03:48:44,990
Uh...

5784
03:48:44,990 --> 03:48:46,430
125 of them.

5785
03:48:46,770 --> 03:48:47,510
Oh, they have...

5786
03:48:47,510 --> 03:48:48,550
Junker Queen.

5787
03:48:48,670 --> 03:48:48,850
Yeah.

5788
03:48:49,250 --> 03:48:49,810
Junker Queen.

5789
03:48:50,350 --> 03:48:51,290
Okay, I want to do...

5790
03:48:51,290 --> 03:48:51,490
Okay.

5791
03:48:52,090 --> 03:48:52,930
What is...

5792
03:48:52,930 --> 03:48:55,670
Okay, I was getting clapped because I was egoing to Rhyne so hard.

5793
03:48:55,830 --> 03:48:56,130
I...

5794
03:48:56,130 --> 03:48:58,310
I will admit...

5795
03:48:58,810 --> 03:49:01,950
I may or may not have been egoing to Rhyne.

5796
03:49:02,030 --> 03:49:08,130
Because I didn't realize how strong Rhyne can be at the final round.

5797
03:49:08,130 --> 03:49:12,310
He was also doing ability power.

5798
03:49:12,930 --> 03:49:18,830
His ability power was unfortunately stronger than what my HP was.

5799
03:49:21,110 --> 03:49:24,830
I literally looked at him and then I was gone.

5800
03:49:26,450 --> 03:49:27,110
Okay.

5801
03:49:27,310 --> 03:49:30,990
Now I understand why people were saying Juno was scared in...

5802
03:49:30,990 --> 03:49:32,070
In...

5803
03:49:32,070 --> 03:49:32,470
Stadium.

5804
03:49:33,290 --> 03:49:33,670
All right.

5805
03:49:35,490 --> 03:49:36,170
Okay.

5806
03:49:36,470 --> 03:49:36,790
All right.

5807
03:49:36,930 --> 03:49:37,870
What does Deanna build?

5808
03:49:38,490 --> 03:49:39,670
Is Deanna strong?

5809
03:49:41,630 --> 03:49:42,170
Guys.

5810
03:49:42,390 --> 03:49:43,910
Is Deanna a good build or no?

5811
03:49:48,480 --> 03:49:50,040
Is Deanna a good build chat?

5812
03:49:51,760 --> 03:49:53,050
Or is she like...

5813
03:49:54,400 --> 03:49:56,160
Or is she like...

5814
03:49:56,160 --> 03:49:57,440
Like a throw pick?

5815
03:49:58,220 --> 03:50:00,500
Is she a throw pick or is she actually good?

5816
03:50:01,460 --> 03:50:02,000
Hehehehe.

5817
03:50:06,420 --> 03:50:07,840
Sometimes rough to use?

5818
03:50:08,460 --> 03:50:08,980
Okay.

5819
03:50:09,360 --> 03:50:09,840
What...

5820
03:50:09,840 --> 03:50:11,260
Should we try Kiriko again then?

5821
03:50:15,590 --> 03:50:16,250
All right.

5822
03:50:16,390 --> 03:50:16,410
All right.

5823
03:50:16,410 --> 03:50:17,090
What build do we do?

5824
03:50:22,700 --> 03:50:24,340
AOE and Nano is strong?

5825
03:50:24,800 --> 03:50:24,900
Okay.

5826
03:50:24,960 --> 03:50:25,640
But what is that?

5827
03:50:26,180 --> 03:50:27,140
Oh, is it...

5828
03:50:27,140 --> 03:50:28,080
That's...

5829
03:50:28,080 --> 03:50:29,280
Is it our turn?

5830
03:50:32,240 --> 03:50:33,900
She just dies.

5831
03:50:34,020 --> 03:50:34,620
Oh.

5832
03:50:36,100 --> 03:50:37,760
That doesn't sound fun.

5833
03:50:37,760 --> 03:50:39,000
Thank you for sh...

5834
03:50:39,000 --> 03:50:39,600
First chatter.

5835
03:50:40,120 --> 03:50:40,500
That...

5836
03:50:44,620 --> 03:50:46,840
That sounds pretty miserable.

5837
03:50:47,580 --> 03:50:48,040
I...

5838
03:50:50,080 --> 03:50:52,200
Maybe we don't play on.

5839
03:50:55,820 --> 03:50:57,060
Good prank.

5840
03:50:57,780 --> 03:50:58,700
But might be good.

5841
03:50:58,880 --> 03:50:59,020
Okay.

5842
03:51:01,580 --> 03:51:03,060
She sounds fun!

5843
03:51:06,280 --> 03:51:07,140
All right.

5844
03:51:07,820 --> 03:51:08,400
Oh.

5845
03:51:08,720 --> 03:51:09,540
All right, guys.

5846
03:51:09,720 --> 03:51:11,480
Do we do Ana or do we try...

5847
03:51:13,940 --> 03:51:16,140
Go for the challenge.

5848
03:51:16,780 --> 03:51:17,780
Do we...

5849
03:51:17,780 --> 03:51:19,020
Go try Ana.

5850
03:51:19,300 --> 03:51:21,240
Do we throw or do we go Kiriko?

5851
03:51:23,820 --> 03:51:26,600
Guys, do we throw or do we go Kiriko, guys?

5852
03:51:27,580 --> 03:51:28,520
Here's the thing.

5853
03:51:31,320 --> 03:51:31,760
Throw.

5854
03:51:33,540 --> 03:51:33,980
Okay.

5855
03:51:34,480 --> 03:51:35,120
Let's try.

5856
03:51:36,280 --> 03:51:37,120
All right, guys.

5857
03:51:37,240 --> 03:51:37,340
Yeah.

5858
03:51:37,480 --> 03:51:38,800
Oh, so I have my London Spitfire skin.

5859
03:51:38,800 --> 03:51:40,080
I love London Spitfire.

5860
03:51:40,380 --> 03:51:43,280
London Spitfire was one of my favorite teams in Overwatch League.

5861
03:51:45,080 --> 03:51:45,580
All right.

5862
03:51:46,940 --> 03:51:49,160
Okay, so what do we do for the Ana build?

5863
03:51:50,780 --> 03:51:51,720
What is it?

5864
03:51:59,900 --> 03:52:01,240
Yeah, they were one of my favorites.

5865
03:52:02,360 --> 03:52:02,960
I think it was like...

5866
03:52:02,960 --> 03:52:04,300
It was London Spitfire and...

5867
03:52:06,220 --> 03:52:06,700
Uh...

5868
03:52:06,700 --> 03:52:07,420
Soul Dynasty.

5869
03:52:08,020 --> 03:52:10,220
London Spitfire, Soul Dynasty, and...

5870
03:52:10,900 --> 03:52:11,300
Yeah.

5871
03:52:11,480 --> 03:52:12,840
These two are my favorite teams.

5872
03:52:16,240 --> 03:52:17,780
Look at these teams.

5873
03:52:18,000 --> 03:52:18,440
Oh, hey.

5874
03:52:18,720 --> 03:52:19,620
They're more meta than...

5875
03:52:19,620 --> 03:52:19,960
Oh, wait.

5876
03:52:20,100 --> 03:52:20,420
They're...

5877
03:52:20,420 --> 03:52:23,620
Guys, I think the enemy team is going meta.

5878
03:52:25,580 --> 03:52:26,240
All right.

5879
03:52:26,360 --> 03:52:27,300
So what do we do?

5880
03:52:27,440 --> 03:52:28,780
It's time for the teams to consult their playbooks.

5881
03:52:28,780 --> 03:52:30,080
What do we buy for power?

5882
03:52:30,340 --> 03:52:31,920
And what do we focus on, chat?

5883
03:52:32,760 --> 03:52:34,560
Do we focus on ability power?

5884
03:52:35,300 --> 03:52:36,600
What do we focus on?

5885
03:52:44,210 --> 03:52:49,790
These are example builds picked by the pros to start our competitors off on the right foot.

5886
03:52:50,910 --> 03:52:51,470
Power?

5887
03:52:51,850 --> 03:52:53,490
Okay, we focus on power.

5888
03:52:54,430 --> 03:52:55,670
5% weapon power.

5889
03:52:56,030 --> 03:52:56,870
Ability power?

5890
03:52:57,050 --> 03:52:57,990
I mean, we can buy both.

5891
03:53:00,050 --> 03:53:00,610
Um...

5892
03:53:00,610 --> 03:53:01,090
And then what?

5893
03:53:01,850 --> 03:53:03,210
Okay, what about the top?

5894
03:53:03,390 --> 03:53:04,690
What do we get for the top?

5895
03:53:05,350 --> 03:53:05,710
For power.

5896
03:53:06,830 --> 03:53:07,690
What do we get?

5897
03:53:09,190 --> 03:53:10,910
Need ability power.

5898
03:53:11,170 --> 03:53:11,390
Okay.

5899
03:53:13,070 --> 03:53:14,990
Nano Boost, Nano Boost, Sleep Dart.

5900
03:53:15,250 --> 03:53:15,890
Is it this one?

5901
03:53:16,530 --> 03:53:17,250
Grants Overheal?

5902
03:53:17,430 --> 03:53:17,850
Oh, crit?

5903
03:53:18,230 --> 03:53:18,950
Which one is it?

5904
03:53:19,110 --> 03:53:20,370
Guys, we have 40...

5905
03:53:20,370 --> 03:53:21,170
Which one is it?

5906
03:53:21,610 --> 03:53:22,230
Give me...

5907
03:53:22,230 --> 03:53:23,270
There's names on them!

5908
03:53:23,510 --> 03:53:24,830
There's your full potential!

5909
03:53:25,570 --> 03:53:27,530
Nano Boost, Home Remedy!

5910
03:53:28,590 --> 03:53:30,150
Sleep Dart, my turn!

5911
03:53:30,490 --> 03:53:31,090
Our turn!

5912
03:53:33,030 --> 03:53:34,070
Tactical Rifle!

5913
03:53:34,330 --> 03:53:34,830
Pinpoint!

5914
03:53:36,590 --> 03:53:37,530
Home Remedy?

5915
03:53:38,010 --> 03:53:38,610
That one...

5916
03:53:38,610 --> 03:53:39,190
Guys, names!

5917
03:53:42,930 --> 03:53:43,970
Home Remedy!

5918
03:53:44,810 --> 03:53:45,750
Which one?

5919
03:53:46,450 --> 03:53:46,990
16!

5920
03:53:47,450 --> 03:53:48,530
I don't know!

5921
03:53:49,030 --> 03:53:49,470
You're...

5922
03:53:49,470 --> 03:53:50,290
You're...

5923
03:53:50,290 --> 03:53:51,810
You're supposed to help me!

5924
03:53:54,290 --> 03:53:54,850
Um...

5925
03:53:54,850 --> 03:53:55,390
Home Remedy.

5926
03:53:55,430 --> 03:53:55,710
Okay.

5927
03:53:56,530 --> 03:53:57,090
Okay.

5928
03:53:59,910 --> 03:54:00,470
Um...

5929
03:54:00,470 --> 03:54:01,090
Did Lifesteal?

5930
03:54:01,210 --> 03:54:01,710
I don't...

5931
03:54:01,710 --> 03:54:02,050
I don't know.

5932
03:54:02,170 --> 03:54:03,130
I was freaking out.

5933
03:54:03,270 --> 03:54:03,750
I was panicking.

5934
03:54:04,630 --> 03:54:05,190
Oh.

5935
03:54:05,570 --> 03:54:06,570
They knew I was...

5936
03:54:06,570 --> 03:54:07,810
I was panicking.

5937
03:54:11,470 --> 03:54:13,250
We don't play...

5938
03:54:13,250 --> 03:54:14,710
Guys, we had a full minute!

5939
03:54:14,890 --> 03:54:15,870
We knew our plan!

5940
03:54:18,730 --> 03:54:19,490
What do I do?

5941
03:54:19,550 --> 03:54:20,830
Do I just give us Overheal right now?

5942
03:54:21,050 --> 03:54:23,370
The objective unlocks in 10 seconds.

5943
03:54:25,150 --> 03:54:25,690
Don't worry.

5944
03:54:26,370 --> 03:54:26,930
Overheal!

5945
03:54:30,900 --> 03:54:31,760
What the heck?

5946
03:54:32,320 --> 03:54:33,240
Oh my god.

5947
03:54:33,420 --> 03:54:33,860
It's been...

5948
03:54:33,860 --> 03:54:35,200
Okay, um...

5949
03:54:35,200 --> 03:54:36,920
Third Person Ana might not be it for me, though.

5950
03:54:37,280 --> 03:54:38,500
Ha ha ha ha ha.

5951
03:54:39,960 --> 03:54:42,040
What is that for looking at?

5952
03:54:42,340 --> 03:54:44,020
What is this boulder?

5953
03:54:47,340 --> 03:54:49,420
Okay, that boulder is crazy.

5954
03:54:52,940 --> 03:54:54,380
Oh, it's so weird.

5955
03:54:59,060 --> 03:55:00,740
Okay, it's really weird.

5956
03:55:00,980 --> 03:55:01,860
I'm not used to it.

5957
03:55:03,240 --> 03:55:05,000
I am not used to it at all.

5958
03:55:05,600 --> 03:55:07,260
I'm not used to Third Person.

5959
03:55:09,500 --> 03:55:10,440
I am...

5960
03:55:10,440 --> 03:55:12,840
I am not used to Third Person Ana.

5961
03:55:17,060 --> 03:55:18,380
I think it's the scope.

5962
03:55:18,500 --> 03:55:19,480
It's the scope part.

5963
03:55:19,760 --> 03:55:20,840
I'm not used to.

5964
03:55:24,340 --> 03:55:24,820
Please!

5965
03:55:25,040 --> 03:55:25,920
I'm right behind you!

5966
03:55:26,440 --> 03:55:26,920
Please!

5967
03:55:35,070 --> 03:55:35,550
Please!

5968
03:55:35,550 --> 03:55:36,530
Please!

5969
03:55:37,050 --> 03:55:37,610
Please!

5970
03:55:37,810 --> 03:55:38,610
Where's my Mora?

5971
03:55:41,390 --> 03:55:41,950
Where?

5972
03:55:42,150 --> 03:55:42,330
Where is my Mora?

5973
03:55:42,330 --> 03:55:43,390
Where did my Mora go?

5974
03:55:46,710 --> 03:55:47,430
All right.

5975
03:55:49,050 --> 03:55:49,850
All right.

5976
03:55:50,930 --> 03:55:51,610
Just say...

5977
03:55:51,610 --> 03:55:53,230
No, it's because when...

5978
03:55:53,230 --> 03:55:55,870
It throws me off when I do Third Person.

5979
03:55:56,190 --> 03:55:56,870
And then...

5980
03:55:56,870 --> 03:55:58,590
I scope in.

5981
03:55:58,910 --> 03:55:59,730
So I get...

5982
03:55:59,730 --> 03:56:01,670
I get, like, so thrown off from it.

5983
03:56:02,810 --> 03:56:03,870
That was, like, my...

5984
03:56:03,870 --> 03:56:04,710
That's my only issue.

5985
03:56:06,290 --> 03:56:07,530
Oh, that's unlucky.

5986
03:56:16,220 --> 03:56:17,140
It's fine.

5987
03:56:18,180 --> 03:56:19,000
Waste of name.

5988
03:56:21,580 --> 03:56:22,440
It's fine.

5989
03:56:24,620 --> 03:56:25,520
I believe.

5990
03:56:27,280 --> 03:56:28,080
Go in.

5991
03:56:29,800 --> 03:56:30,660
I believe.

5992
03:56:35,730 --> 03:56:36,390
There we go.

5993
03:56:36,510 --> 03:56:37,370
I got overheal for us.

5994
03:56:42,220 --> 03:56:44,560
I don't believe in us, but it's okay.

5995
03:56:44,700 --> 03:56:45,280
I have spirit.

5996
03:56:45,520 --> 03:56:46,120
How about you?

5997
03:56:50,590 --> 03:56:51,110
No!

5998
03:56:51,850 --> 03:56:52,390
I need...

5999
03:56:52,390 --> 03:56:53,690
I was waiting for my nade!

6000
03:56:56,550 --> 03:56:58,690
I have to wait for my nade!

6001
03:57:00,430 --> 03:57:02,770
Okay, now I understand why, like...

6002
03:57:02,770 --> 03:57:03,890
I'm a glass cannon.

6003
03:57:04,830 --> 03:57:06,470
I understand now.

6004
03:57:08,190 --> 03:57:10,950
I understand what you mean when you say it.

6005
03:57:11,130 --> 03:57:12,790
Doki, you'd be a glass cannon.

6006
03:57:16,470 --> 03:57:17,110
Alright.

6007
03:57:18,370 --> 03:57:19,010
Alright.

6008
03:57:20,270 --> 03:57:20,910
But...

6009
03:57:20,910 --> 03:57:22,790
I'm not the worst player.

6010
03:57:23,030 --> 03:57:24,790
I am the second best player.

6011
03:57:26,550 --> 03:57:28,130
That's all that matters.

6012
03:57:32,550 --> 03:57:33,190
Alright.

6013
03:57:34,590 --> 03:57:36,210
Okay, now what do we...

6014
03:57:36,210 --> 03:57:37,670
Okay, we focus on...

6015
03:57:37,670 --> 03:57:38,310
We...

6016
03:57:38,310 --> 03:57:40,190
Ability power, right?

6017
03:57:41,770 --> 03:57:42,410
So...

6018
03:57:43,710 --> 03:57:45,190
We focus on...

6019
03:57:45,190 --> 03:57:46,730
Do we focus on ability power?

6020
03:57:47,210 --> 03:57:47,850
Or...

6021
03:57:47,850 --> 03:57:48,830
Weapon power?

6022
03:57:53,200 --> 03:57:54,160
Ability power.

6023
03:57:54,300 --> 03:57:56,520
Okay, so we focus on ability power.

6024
03:57:56,920 --> 03:57:57,520
And let me...

6025
03:57:58,060 --> 03:57:59,480
5% ability.

6026
03:57:59,820 --> 03:58:00,480
I can do...

6027
03:58:00,480 --> 03:58:01,520
I'll do nanocola.

6028
03:58:01,840 --> 03:58:02,480
Okay.

6029
03:58:03,460 --> 03:58:05,220
I'll do nanocola then.

6030
03:58:05,220 --> 03:58:06,480
And then I can get...

6031
03:58:06,480 --> 03:58:08,440
We've already seen so much action.

6032
03:58:08,760 --> 03:58:10,100
I'll get rid of...

6033
03:58:10,100 --> 03:58:10,740
I don't know.

6034
03:58:10,900 --> 03:58:11,660
I feel like the...

6035
03:58:11,660 --> 03:58:13,260
I don't know why I should get...

6036
03:58:13,760 --> 03:58:14,860
Get cooldown reduction?

6037
03:58:15,340 --> 03:58:15,500
Okay.

6038
03:58:15,800 --> 03:58:16,680
Cooldown reduction.

6039
03:58:17,120 --> 03:58:18,400
Do we have cooldown reduction?

6040
03:58:22,980 --> 03:58:23,860
Turning ultimate...

6041
03:58:23,860 --> 03:58:24,380
Ability.

6042
03:58:26,040 --> 03:58:26,480
Cooldown.

6043
03:58:26,480 --> 03:58:28,080
I don't know why I should do lifesteal.

6044
03:58:28,460 --> 03:58:29,920
I don't think it's as good.

6045
03:58:30,780 --> 03:58:31,220
Or...

6046
03:58:31,220 --> 03:58:31,740
Oh!

6047
03:58:33,120 --> 03:58:33,800
Actually, no.

6048
03:58:33,880 --> 03:58:35,320
I don't care about my team enough for that.

6049
03:58:36,020 --> 03:58:36,580
Oh no.

6050
03:58:36,980 --> 03:58:38,360
I'll just keep lifesteals for now.

6051
03:58:39,060 --> 03:58:39,880
Put that in.

6052
03:58:40,040 --> 03:58:40,880
I have enough for that.

6053
03:58:42,780 --> 03:58:43,300
Alright.

6054
03:58:43,460 --> 03:58:44,740
I'll keep my lifesteal just for now.

6055
03:58:46,280 --> 03:58:47,280
I don't know what...

6056
03:58:47,280 --> 03:58:48,160
I don't know what I'm doing.

6057
03:58:49,680 --> 03:58:50,140
What?

6058
03:58:50,400 --> 03:58:51,860
Look at my cool spray.

6059
03:58:52,800 --> 03:58:53,780
Look at that.

6060
03:58:54,160 --> 03:58:54,720
It moves.

6061
03:58:55,760 --> 03:58:56,280
Alright.

6062
03:58:59,040 --> 03:59:00,280
I don't know...

6063
03:59:00,280 --> 03:59:02,440
I don't know where cooldown reduction is, guys.

6064
03:59:04,420 --> 03:59:07,660
I want to play first person for Ana only because...

6065
03:59:10,540 --> 03:59:12,580
I want to do it only because that...

6066
03:59:14,000 --> 03:59:15,440
Only because it's...

6067
03:59:19,580 --> 03:59:21,280
Only because, like...

6068
03:59:21,280 --> 03:59:22,560
It's so chaotic.

6069
03:59:25,680 --> 03:59:26,280
Yeah.

6070
03:59:26,520 --> 03:59:27,460
I don't like swapping.

6071
03:59:27,760 --> 03:59:29,920
It's just too chaotic for me to do first person.

6072
03:59:33,880 --> 03:59:35,560
I don't like this part.

6073
03:59:35,800 --> 03:59:36,400
That's why I'm like...

6074
03:59:36,400 --> 03:59:39,080
I want to do first person because I don't like the...

6075
03:59:39,080 --> 03:59:39,680
Like that...

6076
03:59:48,790 --> 03:59:49,270
What?

6077
03:59:49,770 --> 03:59:51,130
How did you guys die?

6078
03:59:51,950 --> 03:59:53,370
I do use overnade there.

6079
03:59:59,470 --> 03:59:59,950
Please!

6080
04:00:00,910 --> 04:00:01,390
Mora!

6081
04:00:01,390 --> 04:00:04,430
My Mora never heals me!

6082
04:00:04,710 --> 04:00:06,590
I'm so sad!

6083
04:00:07,690 --> 04:00:08,530
Mora!

6084
04:00:09,190 --> 04:00:10,690
I swear to you!

6085
04:00:13,410 --> 04:00:14,250
Mora!

6086
04:00:14,410 --> 04:00:16,310
Why don't you heal me?

6087
04:00:19,030 --> 04:00:19,870
Sad.

6088
04:00:21,390 --> 04:00:23,730
I'll kill you myself, I guess.

6089
04:00:26,030 --> 04:00:27,170
I'm sad.

6090
04:00:27,330 --> 04:00:28,410
The Mora never heals me.

6091
04:00:29,090 --> 04:00:30,210
She hates me.

6092
04:00:30,910 --> 04:00:31,910
She hates us.

6093
04:00:34,630 --> 04:00:35,770
Is this Juno?

6094
04:00:36,110 --> 04:00:36,830
Likes to...

6095
04:00:37,510 --> 04:00:38,830
Likes to front...

6096
04:00:38,830 --> 04:00:39,130
Uh...

6097
04:00:39,130 --> 04:00:39,710
Likes to flank.

6098
04:00:39,950 --> 04:00:40,810
Which I've noticed.

6099
04:00:42,590 --> 04:00:44,710
I need cooldown reduction for this though, for sure.

6100
04:00:46,330 --> 04:00:47,490
I need to use the overheal.

6101
04:00:49,070 --> 04:00:49,990
Oh, he...

6102
04:00:49,990 --> 04:00:51,530
Okay, I didn't think he was gonna look that way.

6103
04:00:52,250 --> 04:00:53,170
Where's our tank going?

6104
04:00:53,710 --> 04:00:54,490
Pink, where are you going?

6105
04:00:55,170 --> 04:00:55,650
Pink.

6106
04:00:57,210 --> 04:00:57,690
Pink.

6107
04:00:58,110 --> 04:00:58,590
Pink!

6108
04:00:59,310 --> 04:00:59,790
Pink?

6109
04:01:02,610 --> 04:01:03,130
Okay.

6110
04:01:07,030 --> 04:01:08,110
Pink, where you go?

6111
04:01:13,240 --> 04:01:15,700
I don't know what my tank was doing.

6112
04:01:16,040 --> 04:01:16,620
Oh my god.

6113
04:01:16,760 --> 04:01:18,100
Me and Mora are like...

6114
04:01:18,100 --> 04:01:21,040
Have more points than our tank and other DPS.

6115
04:01:23,680 --> 04:01:25,560
Alright guys, Ana...

6116
04:01:25,560 --> 04:01:26,920
I think it's a long Kong build.

6117
04:01:28,420 --> 04:01:29,220
For sure.

6118
04:01:33,330 --> 04:01:34,370
Go in, please.

6119
04:01:35,050 --> 04:01:36,370
Please, go in.

6120
04:01:36,450 --> 04:01:37,510
Why are you scared?

6121
04:01:37,510 --> 04:01:39,710
WHY ARE YOU SCARED?

6122
04:01:39,810 --> 04:01:44,230
WHY ARE YOU SCARED?

6123
04:01:44,730 --> 04:01:48,350
WHY ARE YOU SCARED?

6124
04:01:49,250 --> 04:01:52,890
Coming up next, it's time for Clash.

6125
04:01:53,870 --> 04:01:56,530
Oh my god, don't be scared!

6126
04:01:58,430 --> 04:02:01,470
Now's the time for our teams to work out their strategies.

6127
04:02:01,830 --> 04:02:03,710
Okay, what do we do for power?

6128
04:02:04,110 --> 04:02:07,290
Power and then let's figure out how to be better.

6129
04:02:08,770 --> 04:02:10,170
Alright, cooldown reduction.

6130
04:02:11,310 --> 04:02:12,530
Cooldown... I'm trying to find...

6131
04:02:12,530 --> 04:02:16,890
Alright, I'm gonna figure it out for power and then I'm gonna try to find a cooldown reduction.

6132
04:02:17,850 --> 04:02:20,170
Where the heck is cooldown reduction?

6133
04:02:23,730 --> 04:02:24,210
Cooldown...

6134
04:02:25,550 --> 04:02:31,070
Reduces cooldown, landing a sleep dart affected by the 5k middle right.

6135
04:02:31,330 --> 04:02:32,310
Oh, there it is, okay.

6136
04:02:33,210 --> 04:02:33,510
Alright.

6137
04:02:35,610 --> 04:02:36,170
Alright.

6138
04:02:36,310 --> 04:02:36,610
Alright, power.

6139
04:02:39,310 --> 04:02:39,870
Alright.

6140
04:02:41,450 --> 04:02:42,430
What do we do?

6141
04:02:46,370 --> 04:02:47,310
Our turn?

6142
04:02:47,750 --> 04:02:49,330
Also affects other allies.

6143
04:02:49,610 --> 04:02:50,050
It has... okay.

6144
04:02:50,290 --> 04:02:51,530
So everybody gets a nano.

6145
04:02:53,570 --> 04:02:54,130
Yeah.

6146
04:02:54,550 --> 04:02:55,550
Okay, so...

6147
04:02:56,130 --> 04:02:57,230
We have that.

6148
04:02:57,430 --> 04:02:58,770
Okay, let's see if I can get more.

6149
04:02:59,250 --> 04:02:59,710
10%.

6150
04:03:00,530 --> 04:03:02,770
I wanna get rid of this, but...

6151
04:03:02,770 --> 04:03:04,710
I don't know if I can have anything else.

6152
04:03:05,710 --> 04:03:06,770
That would be good.

6153
04:03:07,630 --> 04:03:09,730
I don't have enough money for...

6154
04:03:13,030 --> 04:03:13,750
Let's see.

6155
04:03:16,510 --> 04:03:19,730
You can spend your ultimate after you spend...

6156
04:03:19,730 --> 04:03:20,110
Oh!

6157
04:03:20,310 --> 04:03:21,170
Okay, there you go.

6158
04:03:21,250 --> 04:03:21,870
We should get that.

6159
04:03:21,870 --> 04:03:22,650
So then...

6160
04:03:22,650 --> 04:03:24,490
After I spend my ultimate, I don't need life steal.

6161
04:03:24,870 --> 04:03:26,830
I can just have more ability power after all.

6162
04:03:28,790 --> 04:03:29,190
Okay.

6163
04:03:30,450 --> 04:03:31,750
This should be okay now.

6164
04:03:32,190 --> 04:03:33,250
Alright, after this, we'll try Mora.

6165
04:03:35,070 --> 04:03:36,390
Get my beautiful boy.

6166
04:03:37,810 --> 04:03:40,370
Wanna see the sunset to get their dragoons?

6167
04:03:40,830 --> 04:03:41,110
Whoa!

6168
04:03:41,110 --> 04:03:44,110
Only top 500 players allowed though.

6169
04:03:49,850 --> 04:03:51,950
If you're not top 500, close your eyes.

6170
04:03:56,450 --> 04:03:58,270
I'll just use my overheal here.

6171
04:03:59,430 --> 04:04:01,270
I'll just give everybody overheal.

6172
04:04:02,190 --> 04:04:03,790
I assume that's the strat.

6173
04:04:09,770 --> 04:04:11,190
Okay, that's on you.

6174
04:04:11,770 --> 04:04:12,670
I have to reload.

6175
04:04:14,750 --> 04:04:15,770
That's on you.

6176
04:04:15,890 --> 04:04:18,530
I wanna use it...

6177
04:04:19,090 --> 04:04:19,730
Okay, guys.

6178
04:04:19,910 --> 04:04:21,630
There is a soldier that's just there.

6179
04:04:22,090 --> 04:04:22,170
Oh!

6180
04:04:29,790 --> 04:04:30,910
Okay, our...

6181
04:04:30,910 --> 04:04:32,270
I don't know.

6182
04:04:32,370 --> 04:04:34,150
I feel like Orisa is like...

6183
04:04:34,150 --> 04:04:36,150
So scared for no reason.

6184
04:04:38,570 --> 04:04:39,670
I don't know why.

6185
04:04:40,310 --> 04:04:41,610
Orisa is so scared.

6186
04:04:42,010 --> 04:04:43,310
I'm gonna take high ground here.

6187
04:04:44,390 --> 04:04:46,610
And then we let a soldier just walk.

6188
04:04:48,970 --> 04:04:49,970
Like I...

6189
04:04:49,970 --> 04:04:50,790
Oh no.

6190
04:04:50,930 --> 04:04:51,770
I wanted to...

6191
04:04:51,770 --> 04:04:53,210
I see you.

6192
04:04:56,510 --> 04:04:57,370
Where are they?

6193
04:05:00,570 --> 04:05:01,850
I can't nade that.

6194
04:05:02,450 --> 04:05:03,330
Oh no.

6195
04:05:04,410 --> 04:05:05,010
Unlucky.

6196
04:05:05,790 --> 04:05:07,610
I got to sleep though.

6197
04:05:07,870 --> 04:05:08,190
No!

6198
04:05:09,450 --> 04:05:11,090
Okay, that's a little too late though.

6199
04:05:12,490 --> 04:05:13,090
Jesus.

6200
04:05:14,710 --> 04:05:16,050
Oh my god.

6201
04:05:17,690 --> 04:05:18,510
Tee, please!

6202
04:05:21,210 --> 04:05:22,490
That's the worst part.

6203
04:05:22,830 --> 04:05:24,110
I think Ana...

6204
04:05:24,110 --> 04:05:26,270
I can see why Ana is difficult.

6205
04:05:26,770 --> 04:05:27,670
In this elo.

6206
04:05:28,270 --> 04:05:30,050
Ana is definitely...

6207
04:05:32,670 --> 04:05:34,390
Oh, it's definitely in this...

6208
04:05:34,390 --> 04:05:35,370
Uh...

6209
04:05:35,370 --> 04:05:35,790
Oh my

6210
04:05:40,610 --> 04:05:42,130
god.

6211
04:05:44,270 --> 04:05:44,810
AHHHHH!

6212
04:05:46,560 --> 04:05:47,480
Looks like the wind...

6213
04:05:49,700 --> 04:05:51,160
The score is...

6214
04:05:51,160 --> 04:05:51,960
I'm trying!

6215
04:05:53,660 --> 04:05:54,460
2-0.

6216
04:05:54,600 --> 04:05:56,660
You can really tell who the playmakers are.

6217
04:05:56,760 --> 04:05:58,400
Alright, I'll try a first person.

6218
04:06:00,060 --> 04:06:01,520
I'm gonna try first person.

6219
04:06:02,720 --> 04:06:05,600
I just feel like disoriented when I have to just scope.

6220
04:06:07,340 --> 04:06:08,740
My Morha...

6221
04:06:08,740 --> 04:06:09,620
Gave up.

6222
04:06:11,080 --> 04:06:11,780
Alright.

6223
04:06:14,210 --> 04:06:15,740
I have $7,000.

6224
04:06:16,380 --> 04:06:17,860
Do I... Can I buy...

6225
04:06:17,860 --> 04:06:20,000
I guess I could sell...

6226
04:06:20,000 --> 04:06:20,610
If I sell...

6227
04:06:21,420 --> 04:06:21,920
Nano.

6228
04:06:23,020 --> 04:06:23,900
And then...

6229
04:06:23,900 --> 04:06:25,080
One of...

6230
04:06:25,080 --> 04:06:27,320
I'll sell this so I can buy this.

6231
04:06:27,320 --> 04:06:29,440
So I have 40%...

6232
04:06:30,360 --> 04:06:31,500
Ability power.

6233
04:06:33,860 --> 04:06:35,700
That you just died.

6234
04:06:36,040 --> 04:06:37,320
Yeah, I'm...

6235
04:06:39,200 --> 04:06:41,580
I'm finding out that...

6236
04:06:41,580 --> 04:06:42,400
Ana...

6237
04:06:42,400 --> 04:06:44,260
I need a team to play Ana.

6238
04:06:44,520 --> 04:06:46,590
I need a team to like actually...

6239
04:06:47,140 --> 04:06:48,320
I can enable...

6240
04:06:49,080 --> 04:06:50,820
To be able to play Ana.

6241
04:06:52,150 --> 04:06:54,640
I don't think I'm getting enabled much.

6242
04:06:54,640 --> 04:06:55,780
I don't think I'm...

6243
04:06:55,780 --> 04:06:57,500
I'm enabling much.

6244
04:06:58,540 --> 04:07:00,420
Alright, let's try a first person.

6245
04:07:02,320 --> 04:07:02,880
Okay.

6246
04:07:06,060 --> 04:07:07,720
Is 70 to default?

6247
04:07:08,320 --> 04:07:09,340
Oh yeah, 70.

6248
04:07:09,580 --> 04:07:10,580
Okay, first person.

6249
04:07:11,420 --> 04:07:11,980
Video.

6250
04:07:12,520 --> 04:07:13,620
Okay, I have it maxed, okay.

6251
04:07:14,380 --> 04:07:16,360
Just so zoomed in after third person.

6252
04:07:19,400 --> 04:07:21,760
I can't grenade often though, that's the thing.

6253
04:07:23,640 --> 04:07:25,100
It's the match point.

6254
04:07:25,360 --> 04:07:26,380
Alright, here we go.

6255
04:07:31,180 --> 04:07:32,180
Alright, there we go.

6256
04:07:33,760 --> 04:07:36,500
Oh, I just get so overwhelmed in first person for stadium.

6257
04:07:38,180 --> 04:07:39,260
It's like...

6258
04:07:39,260 --> 04:07:40,760
So difficult to...

6259
04:07:41,440 --> 04:07:42,640
Okay, Mercy player.

6260
04:07:44,580 --> 04:07:46,780
Like, how could it be more fun?

6261
04:07:47,040 --> 04:07:48,980
Oh my god, so...

6262
04:07:48,980 --> 04:07:49,760
There we go.

6263
04:07:49,760 --> 04:07:52,980
There we go.

6264
04:07:56,540 --> 04:07:56,860
Please!

6265
04:07:57,280 --> 04:07:57,400
Please!

6266
04:07:57,760 --> 04:07:58,080
More!

6267
04:07:58,280 --> 04:07:58,300
Oh!

6268
04:08:02,730 --> 04:08:03,510
Okay.

6269
04:08:13,580 --> 04:08:14,660
It's okay.

6270
04:08:15,640 --> 04:08:16,500
It's okay.

6271
04:08:19,760 --> 04:08:20,540
It's okay.

6272
04:08:21,240 --> 04:08:22,800
It's okay, I'm fine.

6273
04:08:26,360 --> 04:08:28,060
Get over here right now.

6274
04:08:28,380 --> 04:08:29,540
You need it.

6275
04:08:32,400 --> 04:08:33,520
Oh my god.

6276
04:08:37,210 --> 04:08:37,810
Please.

6277
04:08:38,190 --> 04:08:40,030
I'm trying my best to keep you up.

6278
04:08:41,030 --> 04:08:41,630
Please.

6279
04:08:42,530 --> 04:08:43,130
Please!

6280
04:08:43,470 --> 04:08:43,650
More!

6281
04:08:43,890 --> 04:08:44,990
I saw the right

6282
04:08:51,930 --> 04:08:52,270
click!

6283
04:08:53,090 --> 04:08:53,690
I...

6284
04:08:54,790 --> 04:08:58,450
I'm falling right click!

6285
04:08:58,650 --> 04:09:00,270
Instead of healing me!

6286
04:09:00,970 --> 04:09:02,890
I'm so messed up!

6287
04:09:05,770 --> 04:09:07,690
So messed up.

6288
04:09:08,010 --> 04:09:09,570
Oh my god.

6289
04:09:10,030 --> 04:09:12,150
Who told me to play higher?

6290
04:09:16,790 --> 04:09:17,990
Oh my god.

6291
04:09:18,890 --> 04:09:20,230
Oh my god.

6292
04:09:20,230 --> 04:09:20,330
Oh my god.

6293
04:09:20,830 --> 04:09:23,850
I'm not feeling it.

6294
04:09:25,050 --> 04:09:26,510
Oh, I missed that too.

6295
04:09:26,650 --> 04:09:33,530
Guys, I'm... I may or may not... I'm being affected right now.

6296
04:09:37,550 --> 04:09:39,190
Guys, I'm not getting healed.

6297
04:09:40,190 --> 04:09:42,550
It's not fun when you're not getting healed, guys.

6298
04:09:43,210 --> 04:09:45,390
That boulder shit is actually crazy.

6299
04:09:45,950 --> 04:09:48,210
Oh, I thought he was gonna... Sorry, that was my bad.

6300
04:09:49,950 --> 04:09:51,150
Sorry, that was my bad.

6301
04:09:57,110 --> 04:09:58,250
Um... You got this.

6302
04:10:01,950 --> 04:10:02,430
Whoops.

6303
04:10:02,750 --> 04:10:03,610
I should have ulted that.

6304
04:10:03,770 --> 04:10:04,470
That was a throw.

6305
04:10:04,970 --> 04:10:07,510
I... Okay.

6306
04:10:07,990 --> 04:10:11,590
Okay, this entire... That round, that's on me.

6307
04:10:15,990 --> 04:10:18,290
I messed up on the nade and the ult.

6308
04:10:19,770 --> 04:10:22,870
I would omit... I threw that part.

6309
04:10:23,050 --> 04:10:23,430
That fight.

6310
04:10:26,250 --> 04:10:27,790
I would omit that.

6311
04:10:35,150 --> 04:10:35,910
Please.

6312
04:10:36,710 --> 04:10:37,470
Please.

6313
04:10:39,310 --> 04:10:41,290
Get the overheal going in.

6314
04:10:41,790 --> 04:10:43,850
Please, get the overheal going in.

6315
04:10:44,190 --> 04:10:48,570
I would... Oh... I understand now.

6316
04:10:49,170 --> 04:10:49,430
I...

6317
04:11:03,560 --> 04:11:05,860
I understand now.

6318
04:11:09,280 --> 04:11:11,780
Guys, I understand now.

6319
04:11:12,920 --> 04:11:17,520
I like looked at it, and I was like, oh, that's where my moro was.

6320
04:11:18,080 --> 04:11:19,380
Is that... I am .

6321
04:11:19,380 --> 04:11:20,780
If I... I...

6322
04:11:20,780 --> 04:11:20,780
I...

6323
04:11:20,780 --> 04:11:22,960
Armora was not playing the game.

6324
04:11:23,440 --> 04:11:26,220
It was... It was mostly... Okay.

6325
04:11:27,140 --> 04:11:29,960
Also, like, Armora was, like, AFK.

6326
04:11:30,560 --> 04:11:32,740
Like, I think half of the game.

6327
04:11:33,240 --> 04:11:34,480
I'm pretty sure.

6328
04:11:37,660 --> 04:11:38,800
Alright, I get it.

6329
04:11:39,040 --> 04:11:40,660
Also, I'm not playing Ana in Stadium.

6330
04:11:40,700 --> 04:11:44,060
I think I'll only play Ana in Stadium if I actually have a team.

6331
04:11:44,300 --> 04:11:47,520
If I have a team, then I'll... I'll play Ana.

6332
04:11:48,900 --> 04:11:53,160
In this elo, in Peslo, Ana's not it.

6333
04:12:01,680 --> 04:12:05,020
It just wasn't it for me.

6334
04:12:05,840 --> 04:12:07,220
Alright, let's do a Mora build.

6335
04:12:09,520 --> 04:12:10,900
Not at all.

6336
04:12:11,580 --> 04:12:13,860
Doing builds is so complicated, though.

6337
04:12:14,560 --> 04:12:14,820
Alright.

6338
04:12:16,160 --> 04:12:16,800
Alright.

6339
04:12:16,800 --> 04:12:17,000
Okay.

6340
04:12:17,460 --> 04:12:19,640
What is the... What are the builds?

6341
04:12:19,880 --> 04:12:21,220
What do you focus on for Mora?

6342
04:12:21,620 --> 04:12:22,640
Ability power?

6343
04:12:23,000 --> 04:12:25,320
Everything is just ability power.

6344
04:12:25,720 --> 04:12:27,160
I guess lifesteal, right?

6345
04:12:27,320 --> 04:12:27,960
Because...

6346
04:12:28,740 --> 04:12:33,760
I feel like if you're always using ability, you're always having lifesteal.

6347
04:12:34,260 --> 04:12:34,840
Alright.

6348
04:12:35,100 --> 04:12:35,620
What else?

6349
04:12:36,240 --> 04:12:37,660
I guess weapon power.

6350
04:12:39,480 --> 04:12:40,940
Double orb for me.

6351
04:12:41,200 --> 04:12:41,340
Okay.

6352
04:12:41,700 --> 04:12:42,940
After using...

6353
04:12:46,010 --> 04:12:47,390
You spend...

6354
04:12:47,390 --> 04:12:48,010
Okay, this one.

6355
04:12:49,370 --> 04:12:50,450
Full damage?

6356
04:12:51,030 --> 04:12:51,770
Okay.

6357
04:12:52,210 --> 04:12:55,030
So you do damage and ability power.

6358
04:12:56,490 --> 04:12:58,710
You do damage and ability power.

6359
04:12:59,530 --> 04:13:01,300
Just because, like, you got the...

6360
04:13:02,410 --> 04:13:02,780
Uh...

6361
04:13:03,150 --> 04:13:03,710
Multi...

6362
04:13:03,710 --> 04:13:04,030
Okay.

6363
04:13:04,030 --> 04:13:08,190
First up, who's ready to stop the push?

6364
04:13:09,290 --> 04:13:10,470
Alright, let's see.

6365
04:13:12,930 --> 04:13:13,690
Yay!

6366
04:13:13,970 --> 04:13:14,410
First pick!

6367
04:13:19,700 --> 04:13:23,760
I think after playing all these characters for support...

6368
04:13:23,760 --> 04:13:26,700
I think my favorite so far...

6369
04:13:27,380 --> 04:13:28,700
Has to be...

6370
04:13:30,120 --> 04:13:31,680
Has to be Juno.

6371
04:13:36,260 --> 04:13:37,940
I think Juno...

6372
04:13:38,680 --> 04:13:39,740
Juno was the...

6373
04:13:39,740 --> 04:13:41,080
Was the most fun...

6374
04:13:41,080 --> 04:13:41,880
In the stadium.

6375
04:13:42,520 --> 04:13:44,220
Out of all the characters I tried out today.

6376
04:13:46,740 --> 04:13:48,820
I think Blackwatch is my favorite skin.

6377
04:13:50,120 --> 04:13:51,320
What the...

6378
04:13:51,960 --> 04:13:53,460
Sorry, I'm trying...

6379
04:13:59,440 --> 04:14:01,300
Ability power Juno is fun.

6380
04:14:01,580 --> 04:14:03,060
Okay, so...

6381
04:14:03,060 --> 04:14:04,060
Multi-ball.

6382
04:14:05,080 --> 04:14:06,440
Start with multi-ball.

6383
04:14:06,840 --> 04:14:08,020
And then...

6384
04:14:08,020 --> 04:14:08,740
What do you guys say?

6385
04:14:08,920 --> 04:14:10,060
The cosmic...

6386
04:14:12,640 --> 04:14:13,200
Um...

6387
04:14:13,200 --> 04:14:13,880
Alright, so...

6388
04:14:13,880 --> 04:14:15,060
Ability power...

6389
04:14:16,020 --> 04:14:17,140
Weapon power...

6390
04:14:17,140 --> 04:14:18,320
And what else do we do?

6391
04:14:19,600 --> 04:14:20,860
What else do we do?

6392
04:14:21,320 --> 04:14:21,840
Uh...

6393
04:14:28,780 --> 04:14:29,340
Survival...

6394
04:14:29,960 --> 04:14:30,520
Gain...

6395
04:14:30,520 --> 04:14:30,840
Ability...

6396
04:14:30,840 --> 04:14:31,420
Lifesteal...

6397
04:14:31,420 --> 04:14:32,200
Do we do lifesteal?

6398
04:14:32,280 --> 04:14:33,000
Or do we...

6399
04:14:33,000 --> 04:14:33,680
Ten...

6400
04:14:33,680 --> 04:14:34,440
Do we do...

6401
04:14:34,440 --> 04:14:35,420
Oh, crossword?

6402
04:14:36,000 --> 04:14:37,220
What is crossword?

6403
04:14:43,040 --> 04:14:44,620
Do we look at...

6404
04:14:44,620 --> 04:14:45,740
Ten percent weapon...

6405
04:14:45,740 --> 04:14:46,260
Attack speed?

6406
04:14:47,420 --> 04:14:49,860
Or ten percent weapon lifesteal?

6407
04:14:51,800 --> 04:14:53,340
Is attack speed better?

6408
04:14:57,100 --> 04:14:58,620
Okay, attack speed.

6409
04:14:58,760 --> 04:14:58,940
Okay.

6410
04:15:00,180 --> 04:15:01,280
More suck.

6411
04:15:02,340 --> 04:15:03,160
Alright.

6412
04:15:04,580 --> 04:15:05,400
Alright.

6413
04:15:05,400 --> 04:15:06,740
Let me know...

6414
04:15:07,780 --> 04:15:08,180
Let me know...

6415
04:15:08,180 --> 04:15:08,820
What else to do...

6416
04:15:08,820 --> 04:15:09,600
In round two.

6417
04:15:12,780 --> 04:15:14,460
Let me know what to do for round two after.

6418
04:15:14,660 --> 04:15:14,980
Oh, wait.

6419
04:15:15,020 --> 04:15:15,960
We have an Ana also.

6420
04:15:16,280 --> 04:15:17,420
Oh, this Ana...

6421
04:15:17,420 --> 04:15:19,100
Oh, this Ana's not gonna have a good time.

6422
04:15:23,020 --> 04:15:23,740
Oh, no.

6423
04:15:24,020 --> 04:15:24,540
Oh, no.

6424
04:15:24,640 --> 04:15:25,240
I am the...

6425
04:15:25,240 --> 04:15:26,380
I am Annie now.

6426
04:15:26,520 --> 04:15:27,300
It's my turn.

6427
04:15:32,900 --> 04:15:34,860
This Ana will have a Mora, right?

6428
04:15:36,480 --> 04:15:37,160
Um...

6429
04:15:43,720 --> 04:15:45,080
We'll see...

6430
04:15:49,060 --> 04:15:50,580
How does that...

6431
04:15:52,020 --> 04:15:52,660
Oh, my God.

6432
04:15:52,760 --> 04:15:53,760
That's the multi-bolt?

6433
04:15:54,080 --> 04:15:54,700
Oh, my God.

6434
04:15:56,260 --> 04:15:56,660
What?

6435
04:15:56,960 --> 04:15:57,140
Me?

6436
04:15:57,680 --> 04:15:58,740
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

6437
04:16:01,300 --> 04:16:02,060
Ha, ha, ha.

6438
04:16:08,520 --> 04:16:08,800
Okay.

6439
04:16:08,980 --> 04:16:10,760
Why heal when I can DPS?

6440
04:16:18,870 --> 04:16:19,410
That's right.

6441
04:16:20,510 --> 04:16:21,090
Oh, no.

6442
04:16:21,210 --> 04:16:21,730
That's not right.

6443
04:16:24,550 --> 04:16:24,950
Alright.

6444
04:16:25,030 --> 04:16:25,390
That's fine.

6445
04:16:30,860 --> 04:16:31,260
Oh.

6446
04:16:33,840 --> 04:16:34,400
Oh.

6447
04:16:34,400 --> 04:16:35,220
There you go.

6448
04:16:37,120 --> 04:16:37,940
There you go.

6449
04:16:39,140 --> 04:16:39,640
Yay!

6450
04:16:40,680 --> 04:16:41,380
Ha, ha, ha.

6451
04:16:43,160 --> 04:16:43,720
Nice.

6452
04:16:45,000 --> 04:16:45,400
Nice.

6453
04:16:46,040 --> 04:16:46,860
Wait, that's easy.

6454
04:16:48,200 --> 04:16:49,420
Now I know what has...

6455
04:16:49,420 --> 04:16:49,920
Oh, my God.

6456
04:16:50,040 --> 04:16:51,460
Mora's so easy in Pistdo.

6457
04:16:52,140 --> 04:16:54,220
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

6458
04:16:54,220 --> 04:16:55,780
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

6459
04:16:56,000 --> 04:16:56,960
Ha, ha, ha.

6460
04:16:56,960 --> 04:16:57,960
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

6461
04:17:01,380 --> 04:17:01,840
Alright.

6462
04:17:03,600 --> 04:17:04,940
Be super aggressive.

6463
04:17:05,120 --> 04:17:06,160
Yeah, that's what I'm doing right now.

6464
04:17:10,630 --> 04:17:11,090
Okay.

6465
04:17:12,750 --> 04:17:13,950
Also, now I know.

6466
04:17:14,470 --> 04:17:15,570
I was like...

6467
04:17:15,570 --> 04:17:16,150
Oh, my God.

6468
04:17:16,150 --> 04:17:16,890
Now I...

6469
04:17:21,230 --> 04:17:22,150
Alright.

6470
04:17:24,330 --> 04:17:25,250
Alright.

6471
04:17:25,870 --> 04:17:25,890
Alright.

6472
04:17:25,890 --> 04:17:27,250
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

6473
04:17:28,870 --> 04:17:29,490
Suck!

6474
04:17:33,120 --> 04:17:33,720
Nice.

6475
04:17:37,000 --> 04:17:38,420
I understand now.

6476
04:17:39,040 --> 04:17:39,920
They can't aim.

6477
04:17:39,920 --> 04:17:43,380
I understand now.

6478
04:17:44,520 --> 04:17:45,480
Yay!

6479
04:17:47,060 --> 04:17:48,520
We did it!

6480
04:17:50,260 --> 04:17:51,220
Alright.

6481
04:17:52,100 --> 04:17:59,560
That explains why my Mora did not need to heal anybody.

6482
04:17:59,980 --> 04:18:01,380
I see now.

6483
04:18:04,960 --> 04:18:07,020
I see now.

6484
04:18:07,640 --> 04:18:09,340
Alright, I'm getting life steal.

6485
04:18:10,160 --> 04:18:11,680
I'm getting life steal.

6486
04:18:11,940 --> 04:18:16,280
Actually, is there a better life steal?

6487
04:18:16,620 --> 04:18:18,800
5% weapon power.

6488
04:18:19,380 --> 04:18:20,740
Alright, what do we get, actually?

6489
04:18:24,600 --> 04:18:30,040
We get 10% ability power and 10% life steal.

6490
04:18:30,580 --> 04:18:35,240
And then we'll get cooldown so we can have multiple orbs.

6491
04:18:36,600 --> 04:18:37,120
And...

6492
04:18:39,900 --> 04:18:42,740
Well, we can't... we don't have enough for...

6493
04:18:44,220 --> 04:18:45,800
Uh, multi-shot.

6494
04:18:45,920 --> 04:18:46,960
Yeah, I got multi-tool.

6495
04:18:47,180 --> 04:18:48,040
We... multi-shot?

6496
04:18:48,120 --> 04:18:48,880
What's multi-shot?

6497
04:18:49,500 --> 04:18:52,260
Okay, so I think that should be good.

6498
04:18:52,600 --> 04:18:54,400
Alright, can I steal anybody's builds?

6499
04:18:55,100 --> 04:18:55,620
What?

6500
04:18:55,940 --> 04:18:57,140
No weapon life steal?

6501
04:18:57,620 --> 04:18:58,980
Did I not buy life steal?

6502
04:18:59,040 --> 04:18:59,500
Oh, okay.

6503
04:19:00,360 --> 04:19:05,760
Um... I mean, I could buy... I'll buy weapon life steal... too.

6504
04:19:07,020 --> 04:19:09,060
So then... yeah, there you go.

6505
04:19:09,140 --> 04:19:10,580
Armory is about to close.

6506
04:19:12,080 --> 04:19:12,600
Alright.

6507
04:19:12,920 --> 04:19:14,320
I don't think we need attack speed.

6508
04:19:15,420 --> 04:19:16,320
I'm gonna do...

6509
04:19:19,480 --> 04:19:20,280
Alright, here we go.

6510
04:19:20,540 --> 04:19:21,480
I can have life steal, too.

6511
04:19:22,260 --> 04:19:23,440
I can live forever now.

6512
04:19:24,700 --> 04:19:25,760
Our Ana doesn't need heals.

6513
04:19:26,660 --> 04:19:29,960
She didn't... she doesn't have... she doesn't have anyone diving here, so she'll be fine.

6514
04:19:31,200 --> 04:19:32,320
I believe in her.

6515
04:19:37,440 --> 04:19:40,680
I believe in her because she didn't... she seemed like she's okay.

6516
04:19:43,880 --> 04:19:46,520
The objective unlocks in 10 seconds.

6517
04:19:46,520 --> 04:19:48,200
They don't have a D.Va, too, which is great.

6518
04:19:51,300 --> 04:19:52,160
That's right.

6519
04:19:52,660 --> 04:19:52,980
Suck!

6520
04:19:54,580 --> 04:19:58,340
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

6521
04:19:59,320 --> 04:20:00,420
Ha ha ha ha ha!

6522
04:20:00,980 --> 04:20:01,220
Ha ha ha ha!

6523
04:20:01,220 --> 04:20:01,320
Ha ha ha ha!

6524
04:20:01,320 --> 04:20:01,500
Ha ha ha ha!

6525
04:20:01,500 --> 04:20:01,540
No!

6526
04:20:02,180 --> 04:20:02,720
Yeah!

6527
04:20:06,140 --> 04:20:09,020
I did a thousand damage after that.

6528
04:20:09,440 --> 04:20:09,960
I...

6529
04:20:09,960 --> 04:20:10,680
I...

6530
04:20:10,680 --> 04:20:11,000
Nice.

6531
04:20:11,800 --> 04:20:12,780
I'm Piranha.

6532
04:20:13,380 --> 04:20:14,360
I'm Piranha.

6533
04:20:14,540 --> 04:20:14,720
I'm Piranha.

6534
04:20:14,720 --> 04:20:15,060
I'm not...

6535
04:20:15,060 --> 04:20:17,240
I am that person now.

6536
04:20:18,700 --> 04:20:19,680
I am them.

6537
04:20:20,740 --> 04:20:22,100
Alright, I'll throw in an...

6538
04:20:22,100 --> 04:20:22,780
I'll throw in an...

6539
04:20:22,780 --> 04:20:23,380
No, actually, no.

6540
04:20:23,540 --> 04:20:24,180
They don't need heals.

6541
04:20:24,580 --> 04:20:25,440
Ha ha ha ha!

6542
04:20:25,900 --> 04:20:27,940
It's all about that DPS, baby.

6543
04:20:32,280 --> 04:20:33,720
Okay, I'll heal her.

6544
04:20:34,300 --> 04:20:35,540
Just a little bit.

6545
04:20:36,680 --> 04:20:38,000
They don't need it.

6546
04:20:38,260 --> 04:20:39,720
Guys, they don't need it.

6547
04:20:40,040 --> 04:20:41,300
I have this.

6548
04:20:42,780 --> 04:20:43,160
See?

6549
04:20:43,400 --> 04:20:44,080
Look at that.

6550
04:20:44,240 --> 04:20:44,320
Look.

6551
04:20:44,440 --> 04:20:45,300
They're all okay.

6552
04:20:47,120 --> 04:20:47,680
Don't worry.

6553
04:20:47,820 --> 04:20:49,000
I'm healing my guy.

6554
04:20:49,660 --> 04:20:50,060
They're fine.

6555
04:20:50,740 --> 04:20:51,100
See?

6556
04:20:51,320 --> 04:20:51,960
Look at that.

6557
04:20:54,060 --> 04:20:54,440
See?

6558
04:20:54,580 --> 04:20:55,080
Look at that.

6559
04:20:55,220 --> 04:20:55,500
There you go.

6560
04:20:55,620 --> 04:20:55,860
Don't worry.

6561
04:20:55,920 --> 04:20:56,420
I got you.

6562
04:20:59,460 --> 04:21:00,100
Don't worry.

6563
04:21:00,240 --> 04:21:00,820
I got you.

6564
04:21:02,760 --> 04:21:03,500
Don't worry.

6565
04:21:03,720 --> 04:21:04,320
I got you.

6566
04:21:08,180 --> 04:21:09,260
Okay, this...

6567
04:21:09,260 --> 04:21:09,560
Nevermind.

6568
04:21:09,720 --> 04:21:10,420
Moro's more fun.

6569
04:21:10,760 --> 04:21:11,960
Moro's fun in this elo.

6570
04:21:12,580 --> 04:21:13,360
Ha ha ha.

6571
04:21:13,560 --> 04:21:13,740
No.

6572
04:21:14,960 --> 04:21:17,520
Moro is definitely more fun in this elo.

6573
04:21:18,660 --> 04:21:24,420
I will say that, when they can't aim, this elo is...

6574
04:21:26,480 --> 04:21:29,140
We have love not aiming.

6575
04:21:33,580 --> 04:21:35,920
It's just like the old days.

6576
04:21:37,860 --> 04:21:38,200
This!

6577
04:21:40,180 --> 04:21:41,340
So back.

6578
04:21:43,500 --> 04:21:46,140
Alright, what do we do for power?

6579
04:21:49,400 --> 04:21:51,020
What is good for power?

6580
04:21:53,200 --> 04:21:55,520
When you just fade, spawn a stationary...

6581
04:21:56,520 --> 04:21:58,180
Well, I want a DPS.

6582
04:21:58,720 --> 04:21:59,200
I want a...

6583
04:21:59,200 --> 04:22:01,660
Okay, our Ana was not getting dived non-stop.

6584
04:22:01,920 --> 04:22:02,060
Okay.

6585
04:22:06,990 --> 04:22:07,550
Cross?

6586
04:22:07,950 --> 04:22:08,790
Cross orbital?

6587
04:22:13,670 --> 04:22:14,590
Cross, okay.

6588
04:22:15,550 --> 04:22:16,850
Alright, and then...

6589
04:22:17,890 --> 04:22:19,850
Let us focus on...

6590
04:22:21,370 --> 04:22:22,950
I want to do weapon.

6591
04:22:23,350 --> 04:22:24,710
Or ability power.

6592
04:22:25,570 --> 04:22:26,910
Okay, we could...

6593
04:22:28,030 --> 04:22:29,230
How much do I have?

6594
04:22:29,250 --> 04:22:30,490
We could buy nano cola.

6595
04:22:31,030 --> 04:22:32,470
And then...

6596
04:22:32,470 --> 04:22:35,110
I have 5% weapon power.

6597
04:22:35,550 --> 04:22:37,790
But I want more weapon power.

6598
04:22:37,790 --> 04:22:38,990
So I could sell...

6599
04:22:40,090 --> 04:22:40,910
I can't...

6600
04:22:40,910 --> 04:22:41,810
I can't afford it.

6601
04:22:45,240 --> 04:22:46,200
Okay, uh...

6602
04:22:46,200 --> 04:22:48,400
I was gonna buy this, but I don't have enough.

6603
04:22:50,720 --> 04:22:52,920
10%, 5% ability power.

6604
04:22:53,960 --> 04:22:57,060
I want to do more damage, but I don't think I can.

6605
04:22:58,540 --> 04:23:01,520
If I sell these two, I still don't have enough money for this.

6606
04:23:02,420 --> 04:23:04,480
Unless I sell this, but...

6607
04:23:04,480 --> 04:23:05,680
This is good.

6608
04:23:07,020 --> 04:23:07,500
Yeah.

6609
04:23:09,000 --> 04:23:10,280
I'll use this for now.

6610
04:23:11,420 --> 04:23:13,740
Bottom, row, middle, rare, ability?

6611
04:23:16,840 --> 04:23:17,560
This one?

6612
04:23:17,740 --> 04:23:18,220
Or this one?

6613
04:23:18,300 --> 04:23:19,480
Well, I can't afford it yet.

6614
04:23:19,980 --> 04:23:20,680
I'll save.

6615
04:23:22,540 --> 04:23:23,360
I'll save.

6616
04:23:26,800 --> 04:23:27,520
Okay.

6617
04:23:27,520 --> 04:23:28,420
But I'm getting the kills.

6618
04:23:30,120 --> 04:23:30,840
Yay!

6619
04:23:32,920 --> 04:23:33,640
Woo!

6620
04:23:36,060 --> 04:23:37,780
I have strong ability power though.

6621
04:23:38,920 --> 04:23:39,300
Jesus.

6622
04:23:41,580 --> 04:23:42,300
Okay.

6623
04:23:42,720 --> 04:23:43,780
That was scary.

6624
04:23:47,440 --> 04:23:49,980
Oh, that sucks.

6625
04:23:50,140 --> 04:23:50,820
I couldn't mute myself.

6626
04:23:53,360 --> 04:23:54,940
Forward, Akko.

6627
04:23:56,060 --> 04:23:57,140
Akko, forward!

6628
04:24:00,220 --> 04:24:02,020
Forward, Akko!

6629
04:24:04,220 --> 04:24:05,720
Oh, I should have healed.

6630
04:24:07,100 --> 04:24:08,320
That's fine.

6631
04:24:10,140 --> 04:24:11,040
Not fine.

6632
04:24:12,800 --> 04:24:13,220
Nice.

6633
04:24:14,040 --> 04:24:15,060
That's fine.

6634
04:24:18,300 --> 04:24:19,300
I suck!

6635
04:24:19,300 --> 04:24:19,520
Suck!

6636
04:24:20,820 --> 04:24:21,720
Sucky suck!

6637
04:24:22,160 --> 04:24:22,760
Sucky suck!

6638
04:24:23,100 --> 04:24:23,780
Sucky suck!

6639
04:24:24,000 --> 04:24:24,460
Sucky suck!

6640
04:24:24,960 --> 04:24:25,560
Whoa!

6641
04:24:32,080 --> 04:24:32,680
Yeah!

6642
04:24:33,800 --> 04:24:34,400
Suck!

6643
04:24:37,320 --> 04:24:39,000
Oh, unfortunate for him.

6644
04:24:41,900 --> 04:24:42,740
That's fine.

6645
04:24:43,020 --> 04:24:43,640
Oh, I should heal.

6646
04:24:43,980 --> 04:24:45,360
I should really heal.

6647
04:24:45,540 --> 04:24:46,680
I should really heal.

6648
04:24:48,140 --> 04:24:49,080
It's okay.

6649
04:24:49,860 --> 04:24:51,700
I can still throw this out.

6650
04:24:53,960 --> 04:24:55,040
Suck time.

6651
04:24:55,420 --> 04:24:55,940
Suck power.

6652
04:24:56,320 --> 04:24:57,040
Oh, no.

6653
04:24:57,400 --> 04:24:58,360
That's fine.

6654
04:25:01,020 --> 04:25:02,240
That's not fine.

6655
04:25:03,120 --> 04:25:04,120
That's not fair.

6656
04:25:05,780 --> 04:25:07,540
He counter-ulted me.

6657
04:25:08,620 --> 04:25:12,680
I can't believe it counter-playing my Overwatch too.

6658
04:25:14,960 --> 04:25:16,420
Okay, I should start dealing.

6659
04:25:17,920 --> 04:25:18,960
Nice, I'm okay.

6660
04:25:22,460 --> 04:25:23,240
C'mon, die!

6661
04:25:25,060 --> 04:25:25,560
Die!

6662
04:25:26,860 --> 04:25:27,360
Oh.

6663
04:25:29,240 --> 04:25:30,040
That's a lucky.

6664
04:25:31,520 --> 04:25:32,900
But I have good attack though.

6665
04:25:37,460 --> 04:25:44,740
Oh my god, okay, I... Okay, nice.

6666
04:25:45,340 --> 04:25:46,120
Oh, wait, not nice.

6667
04:25:46,420 --> 04:25:47,700
Wait, that's a tank.

6668
04:25:48,240 --> 04:25:49,220
That's a tank, Ana.

6669
04:25:50,500 --> 04:25:51,140
Ana, please.

6670
04:25:51,380 --> 04:25:52,100
I'm keeping you up.

6671
04:25:52,200 --> 04:25:52,660
You keep me up.

6672
04:25:52,820 --> 04:25:53,360
I keep you up.

6673
04:25:53,440 --> 04:25:54,300
You keep me up, Ana.

6674
04:25:54,900 --> 04:25:55,800
This is... Please!

6675
04:25:56,600 --> 04:25:56,960
Ana!

6676
04:25:57,920 --> 04:25:58,280
Please!

6677
04:25:58,640 --> 04:26:00,760
I'm doing my... Oh my god, okay.

6678
04:26:00,940 --> 04:26:01,660
Nice, nice, nice.

6679
04:26:01,800 --> 04:26:02,180
That's good.

6680
04:26:03,240 --> 04:26:03,720
That's good.

6681
04:26:03,880 --> 04:26:04,160
That's good.

6682
04:26:04,300 --> 04:26:04,840
Don't worry.

6683
04:26:04,980 --> 04:26:05,960
You won't regret this.

6684
04:26:06,540 --> 04:26:08,100
You won't regret this, Ana.

6685
04:26:08,480 --> 04:26:09,100
Trust me.

6686
04:26:09,100 --> 04:26:11,020
You will not regret this.

6687
04:26:11,180 --> 04:26:13,340
You will not regret this, I told you!

6688
04:26:14,860 --> 04:26:16,520
You won't regret this!

6689
04:26:18,260 --> 04:26:19,620
Bro, he beat it.

6690
04:26:19,620 --> 04:26:24,160
Yeah, just... I told you!

6691
04:26:24,700 --> 04:26:25,800
No regret!

6692
04:26:29,250 --> 04:26:31,190
Your Lucia won't heal you.

6693
04:26:32,550 --> 04:26:34,030
I will know!

6694
04:26:39,100 --> 04:26:41,840
I know that Lucia won't help you.

6695
04:26:45,280 --> 04:26:47,240
Your Lucia won't help you.

6696
04:26:52,100 --> 04:26:53,360
I know.

6697
04:26:53,440 --> 04:26:55,880
Your Lucia will still not help you.

6698
04:26:56,100 --> 04:26:59,040
Your Lucia will still not help you!

6699
04:26:59,360 --> 04:27:00,040
I know!

6700
04:27:04,580 --> 04:27:06,460
I knew it!

6701
04:27:06,620 --> 04:27:09,460
I knew he wasn't gonna help!

6702
04:27:12,320 --> 04:27:13,640
That's right!

6703
04:27:15,120 --> 04:27:17,040
That's... Who's a DP?

6704
04:27:17,040 --> 04:27:18,000
Yes, now!

6705
04:27:18,920 --> 04:27:19,560
What's that?

6706
04:27:21,560 --> 04:27:24,380
Wait... It worked, did it not?

6707
04:27:24,820 --> 04:27:27,920
I mean, I clearly carried that fight!

6708
04:27:28,240 --> 04:27:29,540
It worked!

6709
04:27:29,980 --> 04:27:34,940
Now I can get full ability power!

6710
04:27:38,920 --> 04:27:42,280
More... 7k damage...

6711
04:27:43,100 --> 04:27:45,380
I should really get more weapon damage though.

6712
04:27:45,620 --> 04:27:48,860
I... I feel like maybe I should have went for weapon power!

6713
04:27:49,260 --> 04:27:49,540
Oops!

6714
04:27:51,880 --> 04:27:54,300
I'm gonna quick get rid of Nanocola and then...

6715
04:27:54,840 --> 04:27:57,520
Ugh, if I sell Nanocola, I can get more weapon power.

6716
04:27:57,600 --> 04:27:57,860
You know what?

6717
04:27:57,940 --> 04:27:58,120
Yeah.

6718
04:27:58,340 --> 04:27:59,020
I'll do 15.

6719
04:27:59,200 --> 04:28:00,160
I'll sell Nan...

6720
04:28:00,160 --> 04:28:00,720
Oh wait, no.

6721
04:28:00,760 --> 04:28:01,460
I need multi-tool.

6722
04:28:01,620 --> 04:28:01,800
Whoops.

6723
04:28:02,140 --> 04:28:03,120
Where was multi-tool?

6724
04:28:03,540 --> 04:28:05,400
Multi-tool and then I'll sell...

6725
04:28:06,760 --> 04:28:11,260
I'll sell Nanocola so I can get 15%...

6726
04:28:12,080 --> 04:28:12,700
Attack... Whoa!

6727
04:28:13,300 --> 04:28:15,740
Yeah, 15% weapon power.

6728
04:28:18,420 --> 04:28:20,120
And sell the... Oh, I can't.

6729
04:28:20,200 --> 04:28:20,380
Alright.

6730
04:28:21,440 --> 04:28:23,020
Yeah, I was doing a lot of... A lot of suck.

6731
04:28:27,420 --> 04:28:28,280
There you go.

6732
04:28:28,280 --> 04:28:29,040
It's the match point.

6733
04:28:29,280 --> 04:28:31,940
If they keep it together, they can win this.

6734
04:28:33,000 --> 04:28:33,460
Yeah!

6735
04:28:33,960 --> 04:28:36,080
Three, two, one!

6736
04:28:36,080 --> 04:28:36,380
Yeah!

6737
04:28:37,480 --> 04:28:39,580
Our tank is not doing as well.

6738
04:28:43,570 --> 04:28:45,690
I knew that Lucio was not healing.

6739
04:28:45,950 --> 04:28:46,370
That's why...

6740
04:28:46,370 --> 04:28:48,310
That's why I was like...

6741
04:28:48,310 --> 04:28:50,090
That's why I went hard focused.

6742
04:28:50,670 --> 04:28:52,910
I hard focused everybody else.

6743
04:28:52,910 --> 04:28:58,230
I could tell... I could tell that Lucio was not doing anything...

6744
04:28:58,230 --> 04:28:59,090
For the team.

6745
04:29:01,550 --> 04:29:02,770
And that's good.

6746
04:29:04,410 --> 04:29:05,430
Whoa!

6747
04:29:07,610 --> 04:29:08,410
Nice.

6748
04:29:14,730 --> 04:29:15,290
Nice.

6749
04:29:18,470 --> 04:29:19,110
Let's go.

6750
04:29:21,090 --> 04:29:21,550
Hello.

6751
04:29:22,450 --> 04:29:23,110
Hello.

6752
04:29:23,870 --> 04:29:24,610
Hello.

6753
04:29:30,830 --> 04:29:31,870
Hello, everybody.

6754
04:29:41,340 --> 04:29:43,060
Don't worry, I'm...

6755
04:29:44,220 --> 04:29:45,340
Okay, Orisa!

6756
04:29:47,620 --> 04:29:48,140
Okay.

6757
04:29:52,040 --> 04:29:52,560
Okay.

6758
04:29:52,880 --> 04:29:54,000
That's like unfortunate.

6759
04:29:54,260 --> 04:29:54,620
Look at that.

6760
04:29:54,740 --> 04:29:55,340
See, I can.

6761
04:29:55,640 --> 04:29:56,400
Look at that.

6762
04:29:56,400 --> 04:29:57,140
I healed.

6763
04:30:01,580 --> 04:30:02,780
Look at that, guys.

6764
04:30:03,060 --> 04:30:04,580
Don't say I never healed, guys.

6765
04:30:04,880 --> 04:30:05,480
Don't...

6766
04:30:05,480 --> 04:30:06,820
Don't say...

6767
04:30:07,540 --> 04:30:08,520
Don't say...

6768
04:30:08,520 --> 04:30:09,500
I am your new tank!

6769
04:30:09,820 --> 04:30:11,440
I am your tank!

6770
04:30:12,380 --> 04:30:12,980
I...

6771
04:30:13,560 --> 04:30:15,580
I am your tank now!

6772
04:30:19,260 --> 04:30:21,080
Don't worry, I got you, Ana.

6773
04:30:21,720 --> 04:30:23,300
I'll tank for us.

6774
04:30:23,480 --> 04:30:24,060
Don't worry.

6775
04:30:24,680 --> 04:30:26,340
To take the healer.

6776
04:30:26,460 --> 04:30:27,200
And...

6777
04:30:28,960 --> 04:30:30,060
I don't...

6778
04:30:30,060 --> 04:30:30,920
I had my ult.

6779
04:30:31,360 --> 04:30:31,780
I...

6780
04:30:31,780 --> 04:30:33,180
That's crazy.

6781
04:30:33,980 --> 04:30:36,200
I already got my ult!

6782
04:30:37,520 --> 04:30:40,140
Great boss, Toki!

6783
04:30:40,980 --> 04:30:43,780
Yeah, I think Mora's fun in this elo.

6784
04:30:43,780 --> 04:30:44,520
I...

6785
04:30:48,740 --> 04:30:50,720
Toki is the team!

6786
04:30:51,040 --> 04:30:52,540
I need to see this again!

6787
04:30:53,300 --> 04:30:55,280
The tank that stepped up!

6788
04:30:58,960 --> 04:31:00,660
Alright, our soldier was good.

6789
04:31:00,860 --> 04:31:01,380
He has aim.

6790
04:31:04,080 --> 04:31:05,280
I wonder what his...

6791
04:31:05,280 --> 04:31:06,380
What his perks were.

6792
04:31:08,000 --> 04:31:09,340
Oh my god!

6793
04:31:09,600 --> 04:31:09,860
The...

6794
04:31:10,160 --> 04:31:10,480
The...

6795
04:31:10,480 --> 04:31:11,340
Bionic...

6796
04:31:11,340 --> 04:31:13,280
That bomb with the...

6797
04:31:14,100 --> 04:31:17,700
The bomb with the right click is actually scary.

6798
04:31:18,040 --> 04:31:19,480
Alright, let's do one more Mora.

6799
04:31:19,800 --> 04:31:20,640
I think I...

6800
04:31:23,860 --> 04:31:24,300
That...

6801
04:31:24,300 --> 04:31:25,880
The right click bomb...

6802
04:31:25,880 --> 04:31:26,900
Yeah, that...

6803
04:31:26,900 --> 04:31:29,420
That rocket bomb was...

6804
04:31:29,420 --> 04:31:31,800
That build seemed very strong.

6805
04:31:33,960 --> 04:31:35,320
Yeah, I saw...

6806
04:31:35,320 --> 04:31:35,700
Boom, boom.

6807
04:31:35,900 --> 04:31:37,020
And then the person died.

6808
04:31:39,640 --> 04:31:41,840
It's fun when I get to be a raid boss.

6809
04:31:41,980 --> 04:31:42,480
I'll say it.

6810
04:31:42,580 --> 04:31:44,180
The raid boss build was really fun.

6811
04:31:44,400 --> 04:31:45,280
Also, I'm gonna get more water.

6812
04:31:45,380 --> 04:31:45,760
I'll be right back.

6813
04:32:09,080 --> 04:32:10,760
Also, if you guys wanna...

6814
04:32:10,760 --> 04:32:12,100
Check out Stadium yourself!

6815
04:32:12,960 --> 04:32:13,780
In Overwatch.

6816
04:32:14,200 --> 04:32:15,180
And also you can...

6817
04:32:15,180 --> 04:32:16,280
Click on the...

6818
04:32:16,280 --> 04:32:17,080
My...

6819
04:32:17,080 --> 04:32:17,900
The pinned...

6820
04:32:17,900 --> 04:32:18,120
Sorry.

6821
04:32:18,380 --> 04:32:18,820
English.

6822
04:32:21,520 --> 04:32:21,960
Um...

6823
04:32:21,960 --> 04:32:23,860
Click on the link pinned in my chat as well.

6824
04:32:24,180 --> 04:32:25,760
And you can try out Stadium as well.

6825
04:32:25,840 --> 04:32:26,500
You can click on the link.

6826
04:32:27,680 --> 04:32:28,580
I mean, Stadium is fun.

6827
04:32:28,740 --> 04:32:29,280
I like...

6828
04:32:29,280 --> 04:32:30,460
Experimenting with the builds.

6829
04:32:31,060 --> 04:32:31,540
I think...

6830
04:32:31,540 --> 04:32:34,380
I think the build experimentation was a good thing they did.

6831
04:32:34,660 --> 04:32:36,280
Cause it's like different things you can do.

6832
04:32:36,280 --> 04:32:39,660
And I guess like the longer the rounds are, the more you can like mess around with.

6833
04:32:40,980 --> 04:32:42,360
Which is the fun part.

6834
04:32:44,300 --> 04:32:45,940
Moro is fun in this elo.

6835
04:32:46,680 --> 04:32:47,240
It definitely...

6836
04:32:47,240 --> 04:32:48,720
I would say...

6837
04:32:48,720 --> 04:32:49,500
I think...

6838
04:32:49,500 --> 04:32:50,260
This is crazy.

6839
04:32:50,460 --> 04:32:51,600
This one is crazy.

6840
04:32:51,980 --> 04:32:53,640
The multi-ball...

6841
04:32:54,040 --> 04:32:55,580
The multi-ball is like...

6842
04:32:55,820 --> 04:32:56,300
Unfair.

6843
04:32:58,460 --> 04:32:59,060
Like...

6844
04:32:59,060 --> 04:32:59,460
Like...

6845
04:32:59,460 --> 04:33:00,160
That...

6846
04:33:00,160 --> 04:33:01,280
That's scary.

6847
04:33:01,740 --> 04:33:02,540
Now I...

6848
04:33:02,540 --> 04:33:02,840
Yeah.

6849
04:33:03,740 --> 04:33:04,660
In this elo?

6850
04:33:04,660 --> 04:33:05,320
Yeah.

6851
04:33:05,620 --> 04:33:05,940
Moro...

6852
04:33:05,940 --> 04:33:08,020
I can tell why Moro is good in this elo.

6853
04:33:08,200 --> 04:33:09,160
In the lower elos.

6854
04:33:09,460 --> 04:33:11,200
Just cause of the balls itself.

6855
04:33:13,430 --> 04:33:13,720
Yeah.

6856
04:33:14,390 --> 04:33:15,540
It's very busted.

6857
04:33:15,740 --> 04:33:15,880
Yeah.

6858
04:33:15,880 --> 04:33:16,400
The balls.

6859
04:33:18,600 --> 04:33:19,760
The power...

6860
04:33:19,760 --> 04:33:20,660
The power...

6861
04:33:21,460 --> 04:33:22,040
Uh...

6862
04:33:22,040 --> 04:33:23,120
Ethereal...

6863
04:33:23,430 --> 04:33:24,000
Ethereal one?

6864
04:33:24,140 --> 04:33:24,300
Okay.

6865
04:33:24,340 --> 04:33:24,760
Let's check.

6866
04:33:25,460 --> 04:33:26,140
Let's check.

6867
04:33:27,540 --> 04:33:28,120
Alright.

6868
04:33:28,140 --> 04:33:29,220
What can we do?

6869
04:33:32,080 --> 04:33:32,600
Power...

6870
04:33:32,600 --> 04:33:33,340
Power...

6871
04:33:33,340 --> 04:33:34,360
Is zero.

6872
04:33:35,540 --> 04:33:36,480
What is that?

6873
04:33:36,580 --> 04:33:37,040
This one?

6874
04:33:39,260 --> 04:33:39,780
Gain...

6875
04:33:39,780 --> 04:33:40,500
30%.

6876
04:33:40,500 --> 04:33:41,500
Oh, I have to aim.

6877
04:33:41,620 --> 04:33:43,200
And restore is 100%.

6878
04:33:43,200 --> 04:33:44,660
So instead of...

6879
04:33:44,660 --> 04:33:44,960
Cross...

6880
04:33:44,960 --> 04:33:45,980
Instead of cross...

6881
04:33:45,980 --> 04:33:47,060
We could try this.

6882
04:33:48,420 --> 04:33:50,760
We could try this for more like...

6883
04:33:50,760 --> 04:33:51,420
Weapon power.

6884
04:33:51,700 --> 04:33:52,540
I have to aim at...

6885
04:33:52,540 --> 04:33:54,280
I actually have to aim at the head though.

6886
04:33:55,900 --> 04:33:56,460
Okay.

6887
04:33:57,280 --> 04:33:57,840
So...

6888
04:33:57,840 --> 04:33:59,240
This is...

6889
04:33:59,240 --> 04:34:01,260
I actually have to aim at the head.

6890
04:34:01,480 --> 04:34:02,280
But like...

6891
04:34:02,980 --> 04:34:05,180
Am I willing to aim at the head?

6892
04:34:07,260 --> 04:34:08,380
Am I...

6893
04:34:09,980 --> 04:34:11,700
I have to aim at the head for that.

6894
04:34:15,840 --> 04:34:16,400
Aiming...

6895
04:34:16,400 --> 04:34:16,840
Exactly.

6896
04:34:17,140 --> 04:34:18,200
Aiming with Moro?

6897
04:34:20,100 --> 04:34:21,520
I was doing another Moro around.

6898
04:34:21,720 --> 04:34:23,220
I had too much fun with...

6899
04:34:23,220 --> 04:34:24,000
Being...

6900
04:34:24,000 --> 04:34:25,320
I had too much fun with that.

6901
04:34:25,860 --> 04:34:26,500
But don't worry.

6902
04:34:26,580 --> 04:34:28,740
Maybe this team will make sure I don't have fun anymore.

6903
04:34:29,080 --> 04:34:29,860
It could happen.

6904
04:34:30,320 --> 04:34:32,940
This team could make me regret having fun.

6905
04:34:37,660 --> 04:34:38,460
This team...

6906
04:34:38,900 --> 04:34:39,300
This team...

6907
04:34:39,300 --> 04:34:39,780
We could...

6908
04:34:39,780 --> 04:34:41,100
This team could be like...

6909
04:34:41,100 --> 04:34:42,280
You're starting to have fun?

6910
04:34:42,440 --> 04:34:43,040
Let me...

6911
04:34:43,040 --> 04:34:43,780
Let me...

6912
04:34:43,780 --> 04:34:44,260
Stop that.

6913
04:34:49,780 --> 04:34:50,180
Alright.

6914
04:34:50,180 --> 04:34:51,220
Let's see how it goes.

6915
04:34:53,240 --> 04:34:55,840
Play whatever your heart's desire, buddy.

6916
04:34:56,040 --> 04:34:57,120
We're in rookie elo.

6917
04:34:57,880 --> 04:34:58,060
Like...

6918
04:34:58,060 --> 04:34:59,680
I don't know about you.

6919
04:35:05,250 --> 04:35:05,990
Yeah...

6920
04:35:06,240 --> 04:35:08,910
It's cause our Ana didn't have to...

6921
04:35:08,910 --> 04:35:09,370
Deal...

6922
04:35:09,370 --> 04:35:09,850
With...

6923
04:35:09,850 --> 04:35:11,410
The bullshit...

6924
04:35:11,410 --> 04:35:12,430
I went through...

6925
04:35:12,430 --> 04:35:13,590
Where...

6926
04:35:13,590 --> 04:35:14,910
Uh...

6927
04:35:15,570 --> 04:35:17,490
Where I was dived...

6928
04:35:17,490 --> 04:35:18,690
24-7.

6929
04:35:20,770 --> 04:35:22,390
Aw, they have Reaper though.

6930
04:35:23,050 --> 04:35:23,670
Aw, no.

6931
04:35:23,770 --> 04:35:24,850
They have their own Mora.

6932
04:35:25,810 --> 04:35:27,030
Okay, we know what to do.

6933
04:35:27,150 --> 04:35:28,190
We do multiball.

6934
04:35:28,490 --> 04:35:30,650
And then we do ability power...

6935
04:35:30,650 --> 04:35:32,110
Weapon power...

6936
04:35:32,110 --> 04:35:32,550
And...

6937
04:35:32,550 --> 04:35:32,910
Do we...

6938
04:35:32,910 --> 04:35:33,990
We do lifesteal, right?

6939
04:35:34,090 --> 04:35:35,990
I do lifesteal over attack speed.

6940
04:35:38,590 --> 04:35:40,810
Should I do lifesteal over attack speed?

6941
04:35:40,950 --> 04:35:41,210
Or...

6942
04:35:41,210 --> 04:35:42,250
Oh, we should do...

6943
04:35:42,670 --> 04:35:43,070
Actually...

6944
04:35:43,070 --> 04:35:45,190
Everyone could use a little help in the stadium.

6945
04:35:45,690 --> 04:35:48,250
Ability lifesteal or weapon lifesteal?

6946
04:35:48,750 --> 04:35:49,770
Which is better?

6947
04:35:49,930 --> 04:35:52,210
Weapon lifesteal or ability lifesteal chat?

6948
04:35:56,740 --> 04:35:58,020
Weapon lifesteal?

6949
04:35:59,200 --> 04:36:01,180
Okay, we'll do weapon lifesteal.

6950
04:36:01,520 --> 04:36:02,700
But like...

6951
04:36:03,680 --> 04:36:04,580
I'm thinking because...

6952
04:36:04,580 --> 04:36:06,060
I have three balls though.

6953
04:36:06,880 --> 04:36:08,300
I get three...

6954
04:36:08,300 --> 04:36:08,880
Uh...

6955
04:36:09,980 --> 04:36:10,620
Okay.

6956
04:36:11,440 --> 04:36:13,040
Alright, I'll do weapon for now.

6957
04:36:13,140 --> 04:36:13,600
I'll do weapon.

6958
04:36:15,220 --> 04:36:16,340
Cause I was thinking...

6959
04:36:16,340 --> 04:36:17,660
I get three balls though.

6960
04:36:18,320 --> 04:36:19,640
If I have multiball.

6961
04:36:22,140 --> 04:36:23,540
I'm always damaging.

6962
04:36:28,660 --> 04:36:30,900
Okay, we'll do ability lifesteal next.

6963
04:36:32,960 --> 04:36:33,440
Alright.

6964
04:36:33,680 --> 04:36:34,460
I got this.

6965
04:36:35,140 --> 04:36:36,940
Alright, let's see if I can still have fun.

6966
04:36:37,960 --> 04:36:38,660
With Mora.

6967
04:36:38,860 --> 04:36:39,300
We'll see.

6968
04:36:41,300 --> 04:36:43,020
We'll see if I can still have fun.

6969
04:36:43,020 --> 04:36:43,720
Or if...

6970
04:36:43,720 --> 04:36:44,780
If they shut me down.

6971
04:36:49,240 --> 04:36:49,880
Alright.

6972
04:36:50,820 --> 04:36:51,820
Three balls?

6973
04:36:53,060 --> 04:36:54,280
It's probably three balls.

6974
04:36:59,120 --> 04:37:00,220
Alright, here we go.

6975
04:37:02,720 --> 04:37:04,380
The ladies love it.

6976
04:37:06,320 --> 04:37:07,460
Ladies in chat.

6977
04:37:07,680 --> 04:37:08,600
Three balls or no?

6978
04:37:08,740 --> 04:37:09,580
Three.

6979
04:37:10,200 --> 04:37:10,620
Two.

6980
04:37:11,300 --> 04:37:11,640
One.

6981
04:37:13,300 --> 04:37:14,340
Capture the objective.

6982
04:37:14,760 --> 04:37:15,880
The map.

6983
04:37:19,160 --> 04:37:21,320
Oh, this person didn't build.

6984
04:37:22,060 --> 04:37:22,980
They tried to...

6985
04:37:23,600 --> 04:37:24,020
What?!

6986
04:37:24,020 --> 04:37:24,920
They left?!

6987
04:37:24,920 --> 04:37:26,800
How could you leave?!

6988
04:37:27,660 --> 04:37:30,340
This was my reinforce moment!

6989
04:37:32,180 --> 04:37:34,020
I can't believe it.

6990
04:37:34,920 --> 04:37:36,520
I can't believe they left.

6991
04:37:36,980 --> 04:37:38,000
I'm sad.

6992
04:37:39,680 --> 04:37:42,060
They left for my raid boss moment.

6993
04:37:42,720 --> 04:37:43,680
I told you.

6994
04:37:44,020 --> 04:37:44,660
They...

6995
04:37:44,660 --> 04:37:47,200
They still found a way to make me not have fun.

6996
04:37:47,560 --> 04:37:48,040
They...

6997
04:37:50,620 --> 04:37:51,660
That's sad.

6998
04:37:52,940 --> 04:37:54,660
Wait, does the game keep going?

6999
04:37:56,380 --> 04:37:57,880
Wait, does it still go?

7000
04:37:57,880 --> 04:37:59,400
If somebody leaves?

7001
04:37:59,880 --> 04:38:01,160
Wait, that's not fair.

7002
04:38:01,380 --> 04:38:02,220
I can break them!

7003
04:38:03,640 --> 04:38:04,120
Oh!

7004
04:38:06,740 --> 04:38:08,160
Oh, the game keeps going.

7005
04:38:08,180 --> 04:38:08,660
Oh!

7006
04:38:09,420 --> 04:38:10,500
Oh, that sucks for them.

7007
04:38:11,640 --> 04:38:12,580
Waiting for player?

7008
04:38:12,980 --> 04:38:13,620
Wait, do...

7009
04:38:13,620 --> 04:38:14,540
Can they get backfilled?

7010
04:38:17,820 --> 04:38:18,440
I know.

7011
04:38:18,580 --> 04:38:19,420
That's messed up.

7012
04:38:19,500 --> 04:38:19,640
Why?

7013
04:38:19,780 --> 04:38:21,500
Did they even get a penalty for it?

7014
04:38:22,920 --> 04:38:23,240
Wait.

7015
04:38:25,580 --> 04:38:26,540
Silly reaper.

7016
04:38:26,540 --> 04:38:28,420
You think I'm gonna heal our cast?

7017
04:38:28,700 --> 04:38:29,440
I will.

7018
04:38:29,680 --> 04:38:30,840
After I kill you.

7019
04:38:31,260 --> 04:38:31,620
I...

7020
04:38:33,080 --> 04:38:34,180
Oh, you think?

7021
04:38:34,500 --> 04:38:35,120
That's right.

7022
04:38:38,520 --> 04:38:39,240
That's right.

7023
04:38:39,340 --> 04:38:39,920
I'm coming over.

7024
04:38:40,100 --> 04:38:41,800
I'm coming over, Juno!

7025
04:38:42,440 --> 04:38:42,720
I...

7026
04:38:42,720 --> 04:38:42,920
Oh!

7027
04:38:43,620 --> 04:38:44,760
That's a whole team.

7028
04:38:47,360 --> 04:38:48,140
That's right.

7029
04:38:48,240 --> 04:38:49,140
I'm coming over!

7030
04:38:50,200 --> 04:38:51,480
Give me my ult!

7031
04:38:52,720 --> 04:38:53,600
That's right!

7032
04:38:53,600 --> 04:38:55,080
I'll only kill you!

7033
04:38:59,900 --> 04:39:00,760
There we go.

7034
04:39:01,380 --> 04:39:01,620
Nice.

7035
04:39:02,680 --> 04:39:03,300
There, I healed.

7036
04:39:03,420 --> 04:39:04,600
Don't say I never healed, guys.

7037
04:39:05,180 --> 04:39:06,660
I healed one time.

7038
04:39:08,260 --> 04:39:09,320
Hello, Juno.

7039
04:39:09,720 --> 04:39:10,880
Hello, Juno.

7040
04:39:11,140 --> 04:39:12,180
Hello, Juno.

7041
04:39:12,440 --> 04:39:13,360
Hello, Juno.

7042
04:39:14,620 --> 04:39:15,440
Oh, no.

7043
04:39:15,820 --> 04:39:16,320
Oh, no.

7044
04:39:16,380 --> 04:39:17,340
I didn't even get...

7045
04:39:17,340 --> 04:39:18,280
I didn't get the heals.

7046
04:39:19,120 --> 04:39:20,060
Don't worry.

7047
04:39:20,120 --> 04:39:22,140
I have lifesteal for this one moment.

7048
04:39:22,140 --> 04:39:22,940
Yay!

7049
04:39:24,060 --> 04:39:26,960
The power is going to my head.

7050
04:39:33,320 --> 04:39:36,740
I almost walked too close to the sun.

7051
04:39:36,740 --> 04:39:40,460
Last, time to face off in control.

7052
04:39:40,800 --> 04:39:41,520
No!

7053
04:39:42,860 --> 04:39:44,720
This is too easy!

7054
04:39:45,440 --> 04:39:47,560
I want to have my moment!

7055
04:39:51,500 --> 04:39:53,420
Is there a surrender or anything?

7056
04:39:53,620 --> 04:39:55,640
Because it's just sad.

7057
04:39:56,520 --> 04:39:56,880
Damn.

7058
04:39:57,820 --> 04:39:58,120
Alright.

7059
04:39:59,260 --> 04:39:59,880
What was...

7060
04:39:59,880 --> 04:40:01,260
Guys, I forgot my build.

7061
04:40:02,360 --> 04:40:04,340
Guys, I forgot what we did.

7062
04:40:04,340 --> 04:40:05,360
It's...

7063
04:40:05,360 --> 04:40:05,920
Oh, wait.

7064
04:40:06,000 --> 04:40:06,960
We could do...

7065
04:40:06,960 --> 04:40:07,960
20%.

7066
04:40:07,960 --> 04:40:09,840
And then...

7067
04:40:09,840 --> 04:40:11,340
We focus on...

7068
04:40:13,160 --> 04:40:14,960
5% attack power.

7069
04:40:16,340 --> 04:40:18,200
10% weapon power.

7070
04:40:19,200 --> 04:40:20,200
And max...

7071
04:40:20,200 --> 04:40:20,960
Okay, we get that.

7072
04:40:21,600 --> 04:40:23,120
And then...

7073
04:40:23,120 --> 04:40:24,220
Oh, multi-tool.

7074
04:40:24,420 --> 04:40:24,640
Nano.

7075
04:40:24,940 --> 04:40:25,140
Okay.

7076
04:40:25,980 --> 04:40:27,220
What's multi-tool again?

7077
04:40:28,110 --> 04:40:29,100
Oh, the reduction.

7078
04:40:29,500 --> 04:40:30,600
Okay, let's get...

7079
04:40:30,600 --> 04:40:32,020
Oh, we don't have enough.

7080
04:40:32,260 --> 04:40:32,480
Okay.

7081
04:40:32,480 --> 04:40:33,440
We don't have enough.

7082
04:40:33,540 --> 04:40:34,000
So we'll do this.

7083
04:40:34,100 --> 04:40:34,960
So I can have weapon power.

7084
04:40:35,620 --> 04:40:37,360
And then we'll do multi-tool next.

7085
04:40:42,290 --> 04:40:43,310
I forgot what...

7086
04:40:43,310 --> 04:40:44,790
No, I have lifesteal right now.

7087
04:40:44,950 --> 04:40:46,010
So I don't need it yet.

7088
04:40:47,090 --> 04:40:48,270
I mean, it's a...

7089
04:40:48,270 --> 04:40:49,750
It's a 5v6.

7090
04:40:50,070 --> 04:40:50,410
So...

7091
04:40:50,410 --> 04:40:51,330
Oh, it's a 5v4.

7092
04:40:51,370 --> 04:40:51,750
Oh, wait.

7093
04:40:51,910 --> 04:40:52,630
It's a...

7094
04:40:53,270 --> 04:40:53,670
5v3.

7095
04:40:54,190 --> 04:40:54,590
Um...

7096
04:40:54,590 --> 04:40:55,230
So...

7097
04:40:55,230 --> 04:40:56,770
I guess we don't need a...

7098
04:40:56,770 --> 04:40:58,230
I guess we don't need a...

7099
04:40:58,230 --> 04:40:58,790
Excel sheet.

7100
04:40:59,030 --> 04:40:59,370
Wait!

7101
04:40:59,390 --> 04:41:00,210
You can join!

7102
04:41:00,390 --> 04:41:00,910
Wait, what?

7103
04:41:01,770 --> 04:41:02,810
You can?

7104
04:41:03,170 --> 04:41:03,690
Oh!

7105
04:41:04,670 --> 04:41:05,910
Oh, they left.

7106
04:41:06,570 --> 04:41:06,970
Oh.

7107
04:41:08,870 --> 04:41:10,070
I was gonna say!

7108
04:41:10,290 --> 04:41:11,870
Oh, you can come back!

7109
04:41:14,170 --> 04:41:15,990
Oh, it was a rejoin.

7110
04:41:19,720 --> 04:41:22,120
Bro doesn't understand this is comp.

7111
04:41:24,820 --> 04:41:25,500
Oh.

7112
04:41:26,760 --> 04:41:27,440
Aww.

7113
04:41:30,400 --> 04:41:31,420
And that...

7114
04:41:31,940 --> 04:41:34,400
Please, can I farm you for...

7115
04:41:34,400 --> 04:41:36,260
I need to farm you for stats.

7116
04:41:36,880 --> 04:41:38,760
Let me farm you for stats.

7117
04:41:39,300 --> 04:41:40,340

7118
04:41:40,340 --> 04:41:42,500
I need more stat equals more...

Please, I need the stat.

7121
04:41:48,780 --> 04:41:51,300
Guys, I need to farm you for stat.

7122
04:41:54,020 --> 04:41:55,240
I don't care.

7123
04:41:55,420 --> 04:41:56,620
I'm not gonna play nice.

7124
04:41:56,740 --> 04:41:58,120
I need more numbers.

7125
04:41:58,500 --> 04:41:59,060
Hahaha!

7126
04:42:03,060 --> 04:42:04,960

Yay!

7131
04:42:20,340 --> 04:42:21,500
Look at that, see?

7132
04:42:22,540 --> 04:42:25,560
I got plus 175 from stat farming.

7133
04:42:26,160 --> 04:42:26,620
Look at that!

7134
04:42:27,340 --> 04:42:27,400
Hahaha!

7135
04:42:28,960 --> 04:42:29,380
Yippee!

7136
04:42:29,760 --> 04:42:30,540
Stat farm!

7137
04:42:31,540 --> 04:42:32,000
Hahaha!

7138
04:42:36,160 --> 04:42:38,060
No, that wasn't the last one.

7139
04:42:38,080 --> 04:42:39,280
Cause I barely gotta...

7140
04:42:39,280 --> 04:42:40,880
Gotta do my builds.

7141
04:42:41,760 --> 04:42:43,160
Okay, let me look up.

7142
04:42:43,280 --> 04:42:43,940
I'm gonna Google.

7143
04:42:45,060 --> 04:42:45,760
Mora...

7144
04:42:46,490 --> 04:42:48,520
Best Mora build.

7145
04:42:48,520 --> 04:42:49,540
Stadium.

7146
04:42:51,740 --> 04:42:53,680
Google will be my answer.

7147
04:42:54,440 --> 04:42:54,900
Alright.

7148
04:42:56,440 --> 04:42:58,340
Okay, cross or...

7149
04:42:58,340 --> 04:43:00,500
Okay, obviously we gotta do the...

7150
04:43:00,500 --> 04:43:01,660
Okay, got the multi-ball.

7151
04:43:01,860 --> 04:43:02,740
And then the ethereal.

7152
04:43:03,040 --> 04:43:04,020
And then...

7153
04:43:04,020 --> 04:43:05,460
Okay, this is terrible.

7154
04:43:06,040 --> 04:43:06,720
No, I'm not.

7155
04:43:06,840 --> 04:43:07,580
Who is this?

7156
04:43:08,100 --> 04:43:09,760
In the Mora main subreddit.

7157
04:43:10,500 --> 04:43:12,320
I do not like this build.

7158
04:43:12,580 --> 04:43:12,900
I...

7159
04:43:12,900 --> 04:43:13,220
Hahaha!

7160
04:43:14,180 --> 04:43:14,580
Hahaha!

7161
04:43:17,240 --> 04:43:17,580
Alright.

7162
04:43:18,200 --> 04:43:19,400
Okay, but where do you...

7163
04:43:19,400 --> 04:43:20,080
I need the...

7164
04:43:20,080 --> 04:43:21,680
I need like the chart, you know?

7165
04:43:21,900 --> 04:43:22,400
The...

7166
04:43:22,400 --> 04:43:24,700
You know, like the MOBA chart, you know?

7167
04:43:26,680 --> 04:43:27,200
Um...

7168
04:43:27,200 --> 04:43:28,860
Build stadium...

7169
04:43:29,420 --> 04:43:29,680
Guide.

7170
04:43:29,920 --> 04:43:30,440
There we go.

7171
04:43:30,660 --> 04:43:31,620
I need the chart.

7172
04:43:31,620 --> 04:43:32,700
I don't need like...

7173
04:43:32,700 --> 04:43:33,340
The end goal.

7174
04:43:33,580 --> 04:43:34,600
I need to know...

7175
04:43:34,600 --> 04:43:35,140
What...

7176
04:43:35,140 --> 04:43:35,760
Where it goes.

7177
04:43:36,200 --> 04:43:36,720
Hahaha!

7178
04:43:37,400 --> 04:43:37,900
Yeah, I...

7179
04:43:37,900 --> 04:43:38,460
I don't...

7180
04:43:38,460 --> 04:43:39,040
I don't know...

7181
04:43:39,040 --> 04:43:40,220
I need to know where to start.

7182
04:43:40,220 --> 04:43:41,220
And then like...

7183
04:43:41,220 --> 04:43:42,420
Where I go after.

7184
04:43:42,780 --> 04:43:43,180
I...

7185
04:43:43,180 --> 04:43:44,100
I can't...

7186
04:43:44,100 --> 04:43:45,800
I can't deal with end goal.

7187
04:43:47,360 --> 04:43:49,160
I need my upgrade chart.

7188
04:43:49,360 --> 04:43:49,840
Exactly.

7189
04:43:51,160 --> 04:43:51,740
Okay.

7190
04:43:52,600 --> 04:43:54,640
Unkillable Mora stadium build.

7191
04:43:55,180 --> 04:43:55,620
Alright.

7192
04:43:55,940 --> 04:43:57,360
Let me watch this video.

7193
04:43:57,360 --> 04:43:58,160
Hahaha!

7194
04:44:01,500 --> 04:44:01,620
Hahaha!

7195
04:44:03,180 --> 04:44:03,560
Hahaha!

7196
04:44:03,560 --> 04:44:04,080
Hahaha!

7197
04:44:04,080 --> 04:44:04,780
What is this?

7198
04:44:05,040 --> 04:44:05,320
Okay.

7199
04:44:06,380 --> 04:44:07,360
Move speed...

7200
04:44:08,140 --> 04:44:08,520
Wait.

7201
04:44:09,160 --> 04:44:10,640
Was what I'm doing not good?

7202
04:44:10,960 --> 04:44:12,520
I feel so powerful!

7203
04:44:13,640 --> 04:44:14,320
I...

7204
04:44:14,320 --> 04:44:14,620
Hahaha!

7205
04:44:14,880 --> 04:44:16,300
I feel so strong!

7206
04:44:17,280 --> 04:44:17,660
Okay.

7207
04:44:18,460 --> 04:44:19,900
They're trying to be like...

7208
04:44:19,900 --> 04:44:22,400
Use ethereal accession first.

7209
04:44:22,400 --> 04:44:23,700
Then heartbeat sensor.

7210
04:44:23,840 --> 04:44:25,180
Then frenzy amplifier.

7211
04:44:25,760 --> 04:44:27,080
That doesn't sound right.

7212
04:44:27,080 --> 04:44:28,120
That...

7213
04:44:28,120 --> 04:44:28,720
Wait.

7214
04:44:28,800 --> 04:44:30,560
You mean my build was bad?

7215
04:44:31,220 --> 04:44:32,000
No!

7216
04:44:32,960 --> 04:44:33,420
Hahaha!

7217
04:44:34,860 --> 04:44:35,900
That means...

7218
04:44:35,900 --> 04:44:37,700
My build was bad?

7219
04:44:39,980 --> 04:44:41,140
No way!

7220
04:44:41,820 --> 04:44:42,210
Hahaha!

7221
04:44:44,680 --> 04:44:46,880
Oh, it's a survivability build.

7222
04:44:47,040 --> 04:44:47,180
Okay.

7223
04:44:47,260 --> 04:44:47,800
I won...

7224
04:44:47,800 --> 04:44:48,680
I won...

7225
04:44:48,680 --> 04:44:49,880
Strong build.

7226
04:44:53,040 --> 04:44:54,140
Bad build.

7227
04:44:54,260 --> 04:44:54,820
Yes, guys.

7228
04:44:55,040 --> 04:44:56,240
I'm in rookie elo.

7229
04:44:56,460 --> 04:44:58,040
And you can win with anything.

7230
04:44:58,040 --> 04:44:59,020
You...

7231
04:44:59,020 --> 04:44:59,440
Hahaha!

7232
04:45:00,340 --> 04:45:00,540
Hahaha!

7233
04:45:01,240 --> 04:45:01,700
Wait.

7234
04:45:01,880 --> 04:45:05,780
I'm literally the tank DPS and support at the same time.

7235
04:45:06,480 --> 04:45:10,620
Usually the issue is that when you're playing support, you have no one to help you.

7236
04:45:10,880 --> 04:45:12,940
You can only enable your team so much.

7237
04:45:13,140 --> 04:45:15,620
But like now, I can do everything.

7238
04:45:16,060 --> 04:45:16,480
Hahaha!

7239
04:45:17,560 --> 04:45:19,940
I can actually do something.

7240
04:45:23,140 --> 04:45:23,740
Alright.

7241
04:45:25,540 --> 04:45:26,100
Alright.

7242
04:45:26,100 --> 04:45:26,160
Okay.

7243
04:45:26,960 --> 04:45:27,260
Okay.

7244
04:45:27,260 --> 04:45:27,480
Do I...

7245
04:45:27,480 --> 04:45:27,620
Okay.

7246
04:45:27,680 --> 04:45:28,940
I don't want survivability.

7247
04:45:29,220 --> 04:45:29,880
I want...

7248
04:45:30,720 --> 04:45:31,000
Damage!

7249
04:45:31,300 --> 04:45:31,840
Hahaha!

7250
04:45:32,520 --> 04:45:33,820
The most broken...

7251
04:45:33,820 --> 04:45:34,780
Alright, ML7!

7252
04:45:35,500 --> 04:45:37,060
Tell me what to do!

7253
04:45:37,520 --> 04:45:37,980
Hahaha!

7254
04:45:40,140 --> 04:45:40,700
Alright!

7255
04:45:41,100 --> 04:45:42,480
Where is your guide?

7256
04:45:42,780 --> 04:45:43,220
Oh my god!

7257
04:45:43,340 --> 04:45:45,240
Do you not write down your guide?

7258
04:45:45,580 --> 04:45:45,920
Oh my...

7259
04:45:45,920 --> 04:45:46,500
I have to...

7260
04:45:46,500 --> 04:45:46,840
Okay.

7261
04:45:46,840 --> 04:45:49,340
I have to watch this video guys.

7262
04:45:49,620 --> 04:45:51,800
To figure out what his build is.

7263
04:45:52,260 --> 04:45:52,820
I...

7264
04:45:52,820 --> 04:45:53,380
Hahaha!

7265
04:45:54,320 --> 04:45:55,780
How do you progress it?

7266
04:45:56,080 --> 04:45:58,820
You can't just give me all purples right off the bat!

7267
04:45:58,820 --> 04:45:59,220
What?!

7268
04:45:59,820 --> 04:46:02,080
How do I progress this build?!

7269
04:46:02,080 --> 04:46:02,640
Hahaha!

7270
04:46:04,800 --> 04:46:05,200
Okay.

7271
04:46:05,940 --> 04:46:06,500
Um...

7272
04:46:06,500 --> 04:46:07,920
He gave me end gold build.

7273
04:46:08,100 --> 04:46:09,300
But like, I don't need that.

7274
04:46:09,480 --> 04:46:10,060
I need...

7275
04:46:10,060 --> 04:46:11,160
Start build.

7276
04:46:12,060 --> 04:46:13,380
Wait, I need those...

7277
04:46:13,380 --> 04:46:14,780
Yeah, I need the build sites.

7278
04:46:15,840 --> 04:46:17,820
That needs for maximum engagement.

7279
04:46:18,920 --> 04:46:19,940
Okay, what was it?

7280
04:46:19,980 --> 04:46:21,060
I did weapon power.

7281
04:46:22,080 --> 04:46:23,200
Weapon lifesteal.

7282
04:46:24,240 --> 04:46:24,800
And...

7283
04:46:24,800 --> 04:46:25,660
Ability power.

7284
04:46:25,880 --> 04:46:26,340
There we go.

7285
04:46:27,720 --> 04:46:29,160
Yeah, but like...

7286
04:46:29,160 --> 04:46:30,340
He gives me like...

7287
04:46:31,480 --> 04:46:32,080
He's...

7288
04:46:32,080 --> 04:46:33,320
He gives me end gold build.

7289
04:46:33,480 --> 04:46:34,640
I don't want...

7290
04:46:35,080 --> 04:46:35,320
What...

7291
04:46:35,320 --> 04:46:37,080
How do I start?!

7292
04:46:37,080 --> 04:46:37,460
Hahaha!

7293
04:46:38,720 --> 04:46:39,100
Hahaha!

7294
04:46:40,440 --> 04:46:41,040
How...

7295
04:46:41,040 --> 04:46:43,300
How do I start?!

7296
04:46:46,020 --> 04:46:46,620
Okay.

7297
04:46:47,300 --> 04:46:49,500
Like, why is it purple?!

7298
04:46:49,500 --> 04:46:51,240
I don't have enough for purple!

7299
04:46:55,040 --> 04:46:56,920
The first round is almost...

7300
04:46:56,920 --> 04:46:57,240
Okay.

7301
04:46:59,200 --> 04:46:59,500
Okay.

7302
04:46:59,640 --> 04:47:00,760
He shows me round three.

7303
04:47:01,680 --> 04:47:02,600
That's cool.

7304
04:47:03,200 --> 04:47:04,800
What about round...

7305
04:47:04,800 --> 04:47:05,340
One?

7306
04:47:06,140 --> 04:47:06,740
Hahaha!

7307
04:47:09,080 --> 04:47:10,120
Oh, here he goes!

7308
04:47:10,300 --> 04:47:10,480
Okay.

7309
04:47:11,040 --> 04:47:11,560
Okay.

7310
04:47:11,860 --> 04:47:12,200
Nevermind.

7311
04:47:12,360 --> 04:47:12,880
I got it.

7312
04:47:14,100 --> 04:47:14,700
Okay.

7313
04:47:14,920 --> 04:47:15,540
He puts...

7314
04:47:15,540 --> 04:47:16,780
He puts armor?!

7315
04:47:17,480 --> 04:47:17,940
Alright.

7316
04:47:17,940 --> 04:47:19,220
I'm creating my own build.

7317
04:47:19,700 --> 04:47:20,720
I don't care.

7318
04:47:20,720 --> 04:47:22,100
I'm closing your video.

7319
04:47:22,260 --> 04:47:22,400
I'm closing your video.

7320
04:47:22,400 --> 04:47:22,700
I'm L7.

7321
04:47:23,380 --> 04:47:23,940
Hahaha!

7322
04:47:25,460 --> 04:47:26,400
I'll watch it later.

7323
04:47:27,760 --> 04:47:29,860
And I'm turning on my ad block.

7324
04:47:30,140 --> 04:47:30,980
And I'm joking.

7325
04:47:31,220 --> 04:47:31,680
I'm joking.

7326
04:47:32,240 --> 04:47:32,600
I'm joking.

7327
04:47:32,620 --> 04:47:33,640
That's a joke, guys.

7328
04:47:34,100 --> 04:47:35,160
That's a joke.

7329
04:47:36,000 --> 04:47:36,500
Hahaha!

7330
04:47:41,280 --> 04:47:42,720
I'm doing my own build.

7331
04:47:42,760 --> 04:47:43,420
I gave up.

7332
04:47:48,110 --> 04:47:49,650
A doki original.

7333
04:47:50,530 --> 04:47:51,850
I'm sorry, I'm L7.

7334
04:47:52,050 --> 04:47:53,210
I can't be bothered.

7335
04:47:53,910 --> 04:47:53,990
Hahaha!

7336
04:47:54,190 --> 04:47:54,390
I am!

7337
04:47:59,820 --> 04:48:00,420
Okay.

7338
04:48:01,060 --> 04:48:01,880
Wait, what?

7339
04:48:02,160 --> 04:48:03,620
How did he die so fast?

7340
04:48:08,760 --> 04:48:09,800
Oh my...

7341
04:48:09,800 --> 04:48:11,920
Oh my god!

7342
04:48:12,380 --> 04:48:12,660
Oh my god!

7343
04:48:13,080 --> 04:48:15,380
Okay, the soldier was doing a lot.

7344
04:48:16,540 --> 04:48:17,920
Alright, that's not on me.

7345
04:48:18,180 --> 04:48:18,880
It was just...

7346
04:48:18,880 --> 04:48:19,680
Okay, okay, guys.

7347
04:48:19,780 --> 04:48:20,520
I might look at...

7348
04:48:20,520 --> 04:48:22,400
I'm gonna rewatch the ML7 video.

7349
04:48:22,760 --> 04:48:23,280
Hahaha!

7350
04:48:25,340 --> 04:48:26,560
Maybe he knows what's up.

7351
04:48:27,200 --> 04:48:27,720
Maybe...

7352
04:48:27,720 --> 04:48:29,520
Maybe he actually knows what's up, guys.

7353
04:48:30,180 --> 04:48:30,700
Hahaha!

7354
04:48:31,580 --> 04:48:32,000
Hahaha!

7355
04:48:34,340 --> 04:48:34,680
No.

7356
04:48:35,240 --> 04:48:35,760
No.

7357
04:48:36,240 --> 04:48:36,660
Heels?

7358
04:48:36,900 --> 04:48:37,520
What's that?

7359
04:48:40,580 --> 04:48:42,360
Okay, maybe I do need heals.

7360
04:48:44,220 --> 04:48:44,780
Maybe...

7361
04:48:44,780 --> 04:48:46,100
No, I don't.

7362
04:48:46,380 --> 04:48:47,460
Oh my god.

7363
04:48:47,700 --> 04:48:48,320
No, I don't.

7364
04:48:48,420 --> 04:48:49,820
I can just heal with my orb.

7365
04:48:50,860 --> 04:48:52,260
Okay, I'm gonna start healing.

7366
04:48:52,640 --> 04:48:53,160
Hahaha!

7367
04:48:56,520 --> 04:48:57,080
Myself!

7368
04:48:57,980 --> 04:48:58,480
Oh.

7369
04:48:58,780 --> 04:48:59,740
I didn't think...

7370
04:48:59,740 --> 04:49:01,120
I didn't know where the staircase was.

7371
04:49:01,500 --> 04:49:01,880
I...

7372
04:49:01,880 --> 04:49:02,420
Hahaha!

7373
04:49:03,860 --> 04:49:04,420
Hahaha!

7374
04:49:07,320 --> 04:49:08,540
Alright.

7375
04:49:10,440 --> 04:49:11,660
I...

7376
04:49:11,660 --> 04:49:12,400
I...

7377
04:49:12,400 --> 04:49:14,040
Aw, I have to start...

7378
04:49:14,040 --> 04:49:14,540
Healing!

7379
04:49:17,640 --> 04:49:18,860
Mmm...

7380
04:49:18,860 --> 04:49:21,240
Mmm...

7381
04:49:21,240 --> 04:49:24,300
I guess...

7382
04:49:24,300 --> 04:49:27,400
I guess...

7383
04:49:27,400 --> 04:49:28,960
I guess...

7384
04:49:28,960 --> 04:49:32,600
Um, I'm doing my absolute best right now.

7385
04:49:38,120 --> 04:49:39,000
No!

7386
04:49:39,260 --> 04:49:40,360
I almost killed him!

7387
04:49:42,680 --> 04:49:43,460
Alright.

7388
04:49:44,900 --> 04:49:45,780
Alright.

7389
04:49:46,400 --> 04:49:47,580
Let me...

7390
04:49:48,640 --> 04:49:49,900
Let me...

7391
04:49:49,900 --> 04:49:50,380
Let me watch the video.

7392
04:49:54,920 --> 04:49:55,300
Okay.

7393
04:49:55,740 --> 04:49:57,080
Let me...

7394
04:49:57,080 --> 04:49:59,060
Let me watch the...

7395
04:49:59,060 --> 04:50:00,440
Maybe he's right.

7396
04:50:01,420 --> 04:50:03,100
Maybe he's right, guys.

7397
04:50:03,360 --> 04:50:06,460
Maybe the pro player knows what he's doing.

7398
04:50:07,100 --> 04:50:07,460
Alright.

7399
04:50:08,200 --> 04:50:10,320
I think the pro player knows what he's doing.

7400
04:50:10,480 --> 04:50:12,440
Let me look at what his builds are.

7401
04:50:13,140 --> 04:50:13,380
Okay.

7402
04:50:14,620 --> 04:50:15,700
Cyber Venom?

7403
04:50:15,940 --> 04:50:17,400
Can I afford that?

7404
04:50:18,060 --> 04:50:20,080
What the heck is Cyber Venom?

7405
04:50:20,580 --> 04:50:21,480
This one?

7406
04:50:22,360 --> 04:50:25,280
Okay, I need 10,000.

7407
04:50:25,800 --> 04:50:26,960
8, 9, 10.

7408
04:50:27,180 --> 04:50:30,300
Okay, what if I sell everything and get Cyber Venom?

7409
04:50:36,120 --> 04:50:36,960
Alright.

7410
04:50:36,960 --> 04:50:38,580
Alright, I believe.

7411
04:50:41,320 --> 04:50:42,160
Okay.

7412
04:50:43,220 --> 04:50:45,820
I sell everything and get Cyber Venom.

7413
04:50:46,060 --> 04:50:47,780
Surely, he knows what he's doing.

7414
04:50:48,120 --> 04:50:49,180
I believe.

7415
04:50:52,360 --> 04:50:53,780
I'm experimenting.

7416
04:50:54,120 --> 04:50:55,840
I'm stealing someone's build.

7417
04:51:00,540 --> 04:51:01,320
It's alright.

7418
04:51:02,580 --> 04:51:04,600
I'm stealing his build, I believe.

7419
04:51:06,280 --> 04:51:10,220
And then after that, I get Ethereal Exertion or whatever.

7420
04:51:11,780 --> 04:51:12,300
Make him!

7421
04:51:12,500 --> 04:51:13,680
Thank you for tier 1 sub!

7422
04:51:13,820 --> 04:51:14,680
Thank you, thank you!

7423
04:51:14,980 --> 04:51:16,760
Your build, our build.

7424
04:51:16,880 --> 04:51:18,080
And I'll make my own video.

7425
04:51:20,760 --> 04:51:22,940
And make it a little bit different.

7426
04:51:32,060 --> 04:51:36,540
I'll change round 1 and then keep round 2 and take his round 2.

7427
04:51:42,700 --> 04:51:44,020
Maybe it's my team.

7428
04:51:49,500 --> 04:51:51,920
It could be my team, you know?

7429
04:51:54,400 --> 04:51:55,800
Is it me?

7430
04:51:56,040 --> 04:51:57,280
No, it's my team.

7431
04:51:58,900 --> 04:52:01,420
This is the most I've had to heal my team.

7432
04:52:01,580 --> 04:52:02,100
I hate it.

7433
04:52:02,220 --> 04:52:03,820
I hate it.

7434
04:52:07,800 --> 04:52:08,900
I hate it.

7435
04:52:09,200 --> 04:52:10,480
I miss Raid Boss.

7436
04:52:12,220 --> 04:52:15,260
I miss my time when I was a Raid Boss.

7437
04:52:19,440 --> 04:52:20,400
Oh, you're right.

7438
04:52:20,580 --> 04:52:23,240
Reacting to ML7's build video.

7439
04:52:23,560 --> 04:52:24,660
You're so right.

7440
04:52:24,660 --> 04:52:25,480
You're the best to ever do it!

7441
04:52:30,440 --> 04:52:30,840
Alright.

7442
04:52:32,400 --> 04:52:33,200
Please.

7443
04:52:33,500 --> 04:52:34,560
I am doing my...

7444
04:52:36,860 --> 04:52:38,500
Oh my god, I actually...

7445
04:52:38,500 --> 04:52:39,000
Oh my...

7446
04:52:39,000 --> 04:52:40,420
Nothing can save you!

7447
04:52:43,060 --> 04:52:45,400
Nothing can actually save you!

7448
04:52:48,340 --> 04:52:51,720
Oh my god, I had 3 orbs!

7449
04:52:52,000 --> 04:52:53,900
3 orbs on...

7450
04:52:53,900 --> 04:52:55,780
On our Zarya!

7451
04:52:56,300 --> 04:52:57,940
How did that happen?

7452
04:52:59,800 --> 04:53:02,500
It was 3 orbs!

7453
04:53:05,920 --> 04:53:07,460
I don't understand.

7454
04:53:13,760 --> 04:53:15,420
Oh no, I can't do anything.

7455
04:53:15,480 --> 04:53:15,940
I'm trapped.

7456
04:53:16,720 --> 04:53:20,600
Guys, I think their Zarya is better than our Zarya.

7457
04:53:22,100 --> 04:53:22,740
Alright.

7458
04:53:23,040 --> 04:53:25,500
Alright, what do I do in round 3?

7459
04:53:27,540 --> 04:53:29,920
What do I do in round 3?

7460
04:53:32,020 --> 04:53:32,620
Okay.

7461
04:53:34,440 --> 04:53:35,860
Do I have enough?

7462
04:53:39,000 --> 04:53:39,600
Alright.

7463
04:53:40,180 --> 04:53:41,060
I do...

7464
04:53:43,020 --> 04:53:44,580
Aetherial Exertion here.

7465
04:53:45,000 --> 04:53:46,560
And then I have 6,000.

7466
04:53:46,800 --> 04:53:48,720
How can he afford all of this?

7467
04:53:49,040 --> 04:53:50,380
Alright, I'm doing my build.

7468
04:53:50,500 --> 04:53:51,760
I give up on his build.

7469
04:53:52,020 --> 04:53:52,460
I...

7470
04:53:52,460 --> 04:53:53,960
I've already given up.

7471
04:53:53,960 --> 04:53:55,420
Alright, I'll do Nanocoda.

7472
04:53:55,860 --> 04:53:57,000
And then...

7473
04:53:57,000 --> 04:53:58,360
And then I do...

7474
04:53:59,380 --> 04:54:00,540
Weapon power.

7475
04:54:00,720 --> 04:54:00,900
Okay.

7476
04:54:01,900 --> 04:54:02,620
Lifesteal.

7477
04:54:02,960 --> 04:54:04,300
Weapon power.

7478
04:54:04,860 --> 04:54:05,960
And then...

7479
04:54:06,720 --> 04:54:08,160
And then...

7480
04:54:08,160 --> 04:54:09,440
I do...

7481
04:54:09,440 --> 04:54:10,580
Ability power.

7482
04:54:12,000 --> 04:54:13,040
There we go.

7483
04:54:13,780 --> 04:54:14,600
Oh, multi-tool.

7484
04:54:14,720 --> 04:54:15,080
You're right.

7485
04:54:15,360 --> 04:54:15,620
Alright.

7486
04:54:15,860 --> 04:54:16,300
5%.

7487
04:54:16,500 --> 04:54:17,440
I need...

7488
04:54:18,920 --> 04:54:19,500
Let's see.

7489
04:54:19,660 --> 04:54:21,260
Let me get rid of...

7490
04:54:22,120 --> 04:54:23,880
Get rid of this so I can buy...

7491
04:54:23,880 --> 04:54:24,080
Oh, wait.

7492
04:54:24,140 --> 04:54:24,300
No.

7493
04:54:24,440 --> 04:54:25,580
I need 5,000.

7494
04:54:25,700 --> 04:54:26,200
God damn it.

7495
04:54:26,680 --> 04:54:29,300
I need multi-tool for the 5%.

7496
04:54:29,300 --> 04:54:29,960
Okay.

7497
04:54:30,160 --> 04:54:30,820
We'll do this.

7498
04:54:31,580 --> 04:54:31,820
Alright.

7499
04:54:34,340 --> 04:54:35,280
We'll use chat build.

7500
04:54:37,440 --> 04:54:37,880
Alright.

7501
04:54:38,240 --> 04:54:39,660
I just think it's my team, honestly.

7502
04:54:39,880 --> 04:54:40,240
I...

7503
04:54:44,800 --> 04:54:46,240
My team's not it.

7504
04:54:50,890 --> 04:54:51,490
Alright.

7505
04:54:54,730 --> 04:54:55,750
Did I have...

7506
04:54:55,750 --> 04:54:56,030
Wait.

7507
04:54:56,630 --> 04:54:57,610
Did I do lifesteal already?

7508
04:54:58,110 --> 04:54:59,370
15% power.

7509
04:54:59,830 --> 04:55:01,010
I could do...

7510
04:55:01,010 --> 04:55:03,110
This one for it.

7511
04:55:03,470 --> 04:55:04,150
Oh, it's too late.

7512
04:55:06,070 --> 04:55:06,630
I did that.

7513
04:55:06,810 --> 04:55:08,730
And now I get weapon lifesteal.

7514
04:55:09,070 --> 04:55:10,090
And 5%.

7515
04:55:10,090 --> 04:55:10,690
That'll do that.

7516
04:55:11,370 --> 04:55:12,330
I got it.

7517
04:55:12,950 --> 04:55:14,470
Chat build will work, guys.

7518
04:55:14,710 --> 04:55:15,190
Oh, see?

7519
04:55:15,410 --> 04:55:16,410
It's not just me.

7520
04:55:16,830 --> 04:55:17,170
She...

7521
04:55:17,170 --> 04:55:18,030
She also...

7522
04:55:18,030 --> 04:55:18,890
It's not just me.

7523
04:55:19,310 --> 04:55:21,330
It said 3, 2, 1, and then she used it.

7524
04:55:23,410 --> 04:55:25,110
It's not just me, guys.

7525
04:55:27,750 --> 04:55:29,410
She also messed up.

7526
04:55:31,770 --> 04:55:33,890
I knew it was not just me, guys.

7527
04:55:35,110 --> 04:55:36,210
I knew it.

7528
04:55:39,310 --> 04:55:41,770
I knew it was not just me.

7529
04:55:41,770 --> 04:55:43,450
That doesn't understand.

7530
04:55:49,470 --> 04:55:52,230
I swear to god.

7531
04:55:52,610 --> 04:55:53,890
Zarya, please.

7532
04:55:54,850 --> 04:55:55,750
Zarya.

7533
04:55:57,150 --> 04:55:59,510
Zarya, what are you doing?

7534
04:56:00,530 --> 04:56:02,290
I'm going to let her die.

7535
04:56:03,630 --> 04:56:04,430
There's Zarya.

7536
04:56:04,770 --> 04:56:05,430
I don't know.

7537
04:56:06,790 --> 04:56:07,690
Zarya.

7538
04:56:07,690 --> 04:56:09,030
Oh man.

7539
04:56:14,470 --> 04:56:15,510
Zarya, please.

7540
04:56:15,710 --> 04:56:16,570
I'm playing my life.

7541
04:56:16,750 --> 04:56:18,370
I don't care about Zarya anymore.

7542
04:56:20,610 --> 04:56:21,750
I don't care.

7543
04:56:25,830 --> 04:56:27,650
If she dies, she dies.

7544
04:56:29,450 --> 04:56:35,130
If she dies, she just dies.

7545
04:56:44,400 --> 04:56:47,060
If she dies, she dies.

7546
04:56:47,560 --> 04:56:48,060
Oh man.

7547
04:56:49,460 --> 04:57:07,800
I think... I think our Zarya... doesn't know that... Yeah... I think for sure, their Zarya is 100% a better player.

7548
04:57:08,160 --> 04:57:09,400
For sure.

7549
04:57:12,420 --> 04:57:17,580
Like, it's not even, like... It's not even, like, a competition.

7550
04:57:21,600 --> 04:57:24,620
I think... I have a void!

7551
04:57:26,620 --> 04:57:28,020
Oh my god!

7552
04:57:28,560 --> 04:57:29,140
It's time.

7553
04:57:29,480 --> 04:57:30,600
Okay, one more.

7554
04:57:30,840 --> 04:57:32,420
That was a terrible game.

7555
04:57:32,600 --> 04:57:35,600
Our Zarya was... was a little special.

7556
04:57:42,560 --> 04:57:44,140
This guy's not rookie.

7557
04:57:44,540 --> 04:57:47,220
This guy is definitely not rookie, though.

7558
04:57:47,740 --> 04:57:49,400
What is a meta tank, anyway?

7559
04:57:49,840 --> 04:57:50,340
Chat.

7560
04:57:50,640 --> 04:57:53,860
What is a meta tank in... I'm curious.

7561
04:57:55,000 --> 04:57:57,580
What tank is meta in stadium, chat?

7562
04:57:59,340 --> 04:58:00,300
What's that?

7563
04:58:00,300 --> 04:58:00,300
What?

7564
04:58:00,380 --> 04:58:00,380
What?

7565
04:58:00,760 --> 04:58:01,240
Is it Ryan?

7566
04:58:02,300 --> 04:58:02,820
Zarya?

7567
04:58:03,160 --> 04:58:03,520
Alright.

7568
04:58:06,320 --> 04:58:07,760
Let me look it up.

7569
04:58:10,980 --> 04:58:13,580
Best... Zarya... build...

7570
04:58:14,320 --> 04:58:15,320
What is it?

7571
04:58:15,880 --> 04:58:15,980
Sorry.

7572
04:58:18,440 --> 04:58:18,880
Stadium...

7573
04:58:19,780 --> 04:58:20,220
Alright.

7574
04:58:20,580 --> 04:58:21,560
Where do we go, though?

7575
04:58:21,680 --> 04:58:22,680
How do we...

7576
04:58:22,680 --> 04:58:26,020
Where is the...

7577
04:58:26,580 --> 04:58:28,600
Uh... Also, thank you for the raid!

7578
04:58:29,260 --> 04:58:30,440
Toddless and Kirisuna!

7579
04:58:30,660 --> 04:58:30,880
Thank you!

7580
04:58:31,000 --> 04:58:31,500
Thank you!

7581
04:58:31,760 --> 04:58:32,380
Hello, everybody!

7582
04:58:32,540 --> 04:58:33,520
My name is Doki!

7583
04:58:33,700 --> 04:58:35,640
Today, we're doing a sponsor for Overwatch 2!

7584
04:58:35,880 --> 04:58:36,680
Checking out stadium!

7585
04:58:37,640 --> 04:58:38,900
I actually stream on...

7586
04:58:39,540 --> 04:58:41,720
Uh... YouTube, but today I am on...

7587
04:58:41,720 --> 04:58:43,340
Uh... Twitch for my sponsors.

7588
04:58:43,540 --> 04:58:44,260
So, thank you, everybody!

7589
04:58:44,560 --> 04:58:46,040
Please check me out on YouTube if you want...

7590
04:58:46,040 --> 04:58:47,180
To see more of my content!

7591
04:58:47,620 --> 04:58:47,900
Alright!

7592
04:58:48,360 --> 04:58:49,120
Build time!

7593
04:58:49,380 --> 04:58:50,740
We gotta figure out this build!

7594
04:58:52,240 --> 04:58:52,920
Oh, yeah.

7595
04:58:53,160 --> 04:58:55,500
I like Shanghai Dragons for...

7596
04:58:55,500 --> 04:58:55,760
Uh...

7597
04:58:56,340 --> 04:58:57,660
For my Zarya skin.

7598
04:58:57,800 --> 04:58:59,580
Because it reminds me of Gigeru.

7599
04:59:01,020 --> 04:59:01,540
Uh...

7600
04:59:02,380 --> 04:59:02,900
Like...

7601
04:59:04,100 --> 04:59:06,020
That's why I have Shanghai Dragons.

7602
04:59:06,020 --> 04:59:07,600
The first, uh...

7603
04:59:07,600 --> 04:59:09,080
Overwatch female pro player.

7604
04:59:10,200 --> 04:59:11,340
In Overwatch League.

7605
04:59:12,080 --> 04:59:13,360
And she had, like...

7606
04:59:13,360 --> 04:59:14,500
Really, really good Zarya.

7607
04:59:16,460 --> 04:59:17,500
And D.Va, too.

7608
04:59:21,860 --> 04:59:22,780
Yeah, Gigeru.

7609
04:59:24,840 --> 04:59:26,160
Is Junker Queen good?

7610
04:59:26,160 --> 04:59:27,800
I see so many people on Junker Queen.

7611
04:59:28,480 --> 04:59:30,880
That's why I have Shanghai Dragons as my skin.

7612
04:59:31,880 --> 04:59:33,340
Yeah, people thought she was cheating.

7613
04:59:33,500 --> 04:59:35,080
And then I remember players were like...

7614
04:59:35,410 --> 04:59:38,140
I will quit pro play if she's actually a real player.

7615
04:59:38,140 --> 04:59:39,220
And then, like...

7616
04:59:39,220 --> 04:59:40,700
I don't know if they actually quit.

7617
04:59:41,720 --> 04:59:42,700
Alright, guys.

7618
04:59:42,860 --> 04:59:43,140
What?

7619
04:59:43,320 --> 04:59:43,980
What do we do?

7620
04:59:44,060 --> 04:59:45,120
Is it ability power?

7621
04:59:45,240 --> 04:59:45,860
Weapon power?

7622
04:59:45,980 --> 04:59:47,200
What do I focus on?

7623
04:59:50,340 --> 04:59:50,860
Uh...

7624
04:59:52,220 --> 04:59:53,320
What do I do?

7625
04:59:54,960 --> 04:59:55,480
Major...

7626
04:59:55,920 --> 04:59:56,180
Uh...

7627
04:59:56,180 --> 04:59:56,840
Weapon power?

7628
04:59:57,220 --> 04:59:58,520
Alright, weapon power.

7629
05:00:01,480 --> 05:00:02,000
Uh...

7630
05:00:02,000 --> 05:00:02,860
Okay, weapon power.

7631
05:00:02,940 --> 05:00:04,180
Do I have more weapon power or no?

7632
05:00:04,180 --> 05:00:04,780
Do I do...

7633
05:00:04,780 --> 05:00:06,020
I'll do lifesteal, too, for it.

7634
05:00:06,200 --> 05:00:07,020
Alright, what about power?

7635
05:00:07,740 --> 05:00:09,080
What do I do for the power, then?

7636
05:00:12,920 --> 05:00:13,360
Uh...

7637
05:00:13,360 --> 05:00:13,900
From...

7638
05:00:13,900 --> 05:00:16,820
Do not take notes from me because I don't know what I'm doing.

7639
05:00:17,280 --> 05:00:17,720
I...

7640
05:00:18,540 --> 05:00:18,980
Guys!

7641
05:00:19,260 --> 05:00:22,840
I have no idea what I am doing right now.

7642
05:00:23,160 --> 05:00:24,440
Guys, what is the power?

7643
05:00:25,760 --> 05:00:26,440
Power!

7644
05:00:26,440 --> 05:00:27,540
I'm literally...

7645
05:00:27,540 --> 05:00:28,860
Using chat build!

7646
05:00:31,620 --> 05:00:32,300
Alright.

7647
05:00:32,660 --> 05:00:32,940
Guys!

7648
05:00:33,140 --> 05:00:33,520
Power!

7649
05:00:35,120 --> 05:00:35,460
Vortex?

7650
05:00:35,940 --> 05:00:36,720
No limits.

7651
05:00:36,940 --> 05:00:37,920
Where the heck is vortex?

7652
05:00:38,160 --> 05:00:38,520
This one?

7653
05:00:39,380 --> 05:00:40,060
Cast...

7654
05:00:40,060 --> 05:00:43,900
Expires a slowing vortex that deals a hundred damage every two seconds.

7655
05:00:45,300 --> 05:00:45,980
Uh...

7656
05:00:45,980 --> 05:00:46,920
This one?

7657
05:00:49,240 --> 05:00:50,120
Or do...

7658
05:00:50,120 --> 05:00:51,040
Is there another one I should try?

7659
05:00:54,720 --> 05:00:55,080
Uh...

7660
05:00:55,080 --> 05:00:55,200
Yeah?

7661
05:00:55,400 --> 05:00:55,540
Okay.

7662
05:00:56,720 --> 05:00:57,040
Alright.

7663
05:00:57,120 --> 05:00:57,520
Let's do it.

7664
05:00:59,320 --> 05:00:59,680
Alright.

7665
05:01:01,240 --> 05:01:01,600
Uh...

7666
05:01:01,600 --> 05:01:01,780
Reedy!

7667
05:01:01,940 --> 05:01:04,740
Thank you for gifting a sub to both Kirsuna and Dotless!

7668
05:01:04,860 --> 05:01:05,080
Thank you!

7669
05:01:05,140 --> 05:01:05,460
Thank you!

7670
05:01:05,460 --> 05:01:06,560
Thank you for tier one sub!

7671
05:01:06,740 --> 05:01:06,940
Thank you!

7672
05:01:07,260 --> 05:01:07,620
Alright.

7673
05:01:07,700 --> 05:01:08,060
Here we go.

7674
05:01:10,280 --> 05:01:10,640
Alright.

7675
05:01:10,720 --> 05:01:11,180
Let's do it.

7676
05:01:11,920 --> 05:01:13,420
I don't even remember...

7677
05:01:13,420 --> 05:01:14,120
I don't...

7678
05:01:15,440 --> 05:01:16,920
It's been a while since I played Zarya.

7679
05:01:20,480 --> 05:01:20,840
Alright.

7680
05:01:21,920 --> 05:01:23,600
I do that because it's faster.

7681
05:01:23,600 --> 05:01:23,680
Here.

7682
05:01:29,960 --> 05:01:31,940
Oh, I should have saved that actually.

7683
05:01:32,380 --> 05:01:33,360
That's my bad.

7684
05:01:33,880 --> 05:01:35,060
I should have saved that.

7685
05:01:36,680 --> 05:01:37,320
Ooh.

7686
05:01:37,940 --> 05:01:38,660
Hello.

7687
05:01:40,620 --> 05:01:41,340
Please!

7688
05:01:41,720 --> 05:01:42,760
Hit my shield!

7689
05:01:43,440 --> 05:01:45,560
I have zero damage!

7690
05:01:46,760 --> 05:01:48,120
Genji get damage!

7691
05:01:48,700 --> 05:01:51,040
Why is no one shooting at my Genji?

7692
05:01:55,100 --> 05:01:56,640
Someone shoot my Genji!

7693
05:01:56,980 --> 05:01:57,140
Someone shoot my Genji!

7694
05:01:57,140 --> 05:01:57,540
Oh, there you go.

7695
05:01:57,740 --> 05:01:57,980
Nice.

7696
05:01:58,300 --> 05:01:58,900
That's what I wanted.

7697
05:01:59,780 --> 05:02:00,040
Nice.

7698
05:02:00,240 --> 05:02:00,360
Okay.

7699
05:02:00,440 --> 05:02:01,300
Someone shot at my Genji.

7700
05:02:01,400 --> 05:02:01,780
Thank God.

7701
05:02:01,940 --> 05:02:02,480
Or shot at me.

7702
05:02:02,620 --> 05:02:03,000
Thank God.

7703
05:02:04,820 --> 05:02:05,520
Shoot me!

7704
05:02:08,080 --> 05:02:08,480
Alright.

7705
05:02:08,640 --> 05:02:08,840
Don't worry.

7706
05:02:08,940 --> 05:02:09,260
I tank.

7707
05:02:10,880 --> 05:02:11,460
Don't worry.

7708
05:02:14,580 --> 05:02:15,200
Shoot me!

7709
05:02:16,320 --> 05:02:17,000
There you go.

7710
05:02:17,000 --> 05:02:18,320
I need that.

7711
05:02:19,640 --> 05:02:20,740
Please, keep shooting!

7712
05:02:25,910 --> 05:02:26,370
Yes!

7713
05:02:28,070 --> 05:02:29,230
That's what I needed!

7714
05:02:33,860 --> 05:02:34,320
Nice.

7715
05:02:34,460 --> 05:02:34,880
Okay, nice.

7716
05:02:35,000 --> 05:02:35,400
There you go.

7717
05:02:37,800 --> 05:02:38,640
Wait, where you go?

7718
05:02:39,620 --> 05:02:40,080
Alright.

7719
05:02:41,500 --> 05:02:43,060
Thank God I got shot at.

7720
05:02:43,280 --> 05:02:43,660
Shoot me!

7721
05:02:43,780 --> 05:02:44,380
I'm right here!

7722
05:02:46,000 --> 05:02:46,460
Yes!

7723
05:02:48,620 --> 05:02:50,400
I might have died doing that though.

7724
05:02:50,880 --> 05:02:52,480
I actually, I might have thrown doing that.

7725
05:02:53,060 --> 05:02:53,500
No.

7726
05:02:54,800 --> 05:02:55,260
Oh, yeah.

7727
05:02:56,160 --> 05:02:59,800
Yeah, I might have just stood there trying to wait for him to shoot me.

7728
05:03:00,260 --> 05:03:00,760
That's okay.

7729
05:03:00,780 --> 05:03:01,320
I get it.

7730
05:03:01,420 --> 05:03:02,440
It was worth it.

7731
05:03:02,700 --> 05:03:03,900
It was worth it.

7732
05:03:05,680 --> 05:03:06,320
It's fine.

7733
05:03:06,460 --> 05:03:07,660
We were gonna die regardless.

7734
05:03:07,980 --> 05:03:08,640
We had ults.

7735
05:03:08,680 --> 05:03:08,960
Okay?

7736
05:03:11,960 --> 05:03:14,740
I hate baiting for them to actually shoot me.

7737
05:03:14,860 --> 05:03:15,980
It's actually so frustrating.

7738
05:03:17,460 --> 05:03:18,300
There we go.

7739
05:03:20,260 --> 05:03:21,800
I think that's like the worst part.

7740
05:03:23,940 --> 05:03:24,680
There we go.

7741
05:03:24,880 --> 05:03:25,960
I need more damage!

7742
05:03:27,620 --> 05:03:28,340
That's it.

7743
05:03:28,940 --> 05:03:29,440
Angry.

7744
05:03:34,520 --> 05:03:35,340
There we go.

7745
05:03:36,960 --> 05:03:37,720
There we go.

7746
05:03:39,960 --> 05:03:40,820
Oh my God!

7747
05:03:40,940 --> 05:03:41,540
That's a bomb!

7748
05:03:41,840 --> 05:03:42,500
Oh my God!

7749
05:03:42,700 --> 05:03:44,020
We're- Oh my God!

7750
05:03:44,220 --> 05:03:47,060
We're- They grabbed- They bombed my grab!

7751
05:03:47,720 --> 05:03:50,760
Oh, they- Oh, that was unlucky.

7752
05:03:51,120 --> 05:03:52,580
I was not gonna live that.

7753
05:03:53,140 --> 05:03:54,960
That was- That was scary.

7754
05:03:55,680 --> 05:03:57,860
I don't think I was gonna live that, guys.

7755
05:03:58,160 --> 05:04:01,160
They- They did so much damage.

7756
05:04:01,760 --> 05:04:03,340
Wait, and they- They shot nothing?

7757
05:04:05,580 --> 05:04:07,180
Oh, I don't have shift.

7758
05:04:10,830 --> 05:04:11,610
Please.

7759
05:04:12,770 --> 05:04:13,310
Yay!

7760
05:04:14,990 --> 05:04:17,970
Huge often- Oh, what one person died?

7761
05:04:19,710 --> 05:04:20,490
Yay!

7762
05:04:24,190 --> 05:04:25,730
Yeah, they see none.

7763
05:04:26,110 --> 05:04:26,830
What?!

7764
05:04:26,830 --> 05:04:28,170
Look at my damage!

7765
05:04:28,170 --> 05:04:30,490
I out-damaged my two DPS combined!

7766
05:04:33,750 --> 05:04:34,310
Alright.

7767
05:04:34,810 --> 05:04:36,070
What do we do here?

7768
05:04:38,370 --> 05:04:38,930
Huh...

7769
05:04:38,930 --> 05:04:44,310
So we- Do we focus on out- Do we focus on- We focus on weapon power, right?

7770
05:04:47,750 --> 05:04:53,210
I guess- Okay, multi- We'll do ice coolant, because- That's the cooldown reduction.

7771
05:04:53,850 --> 05:04:58,630
We need cooldown reduction for- For our bubbles, for sure.

7772
05:04:59,330 --> 05:05:10,790
And then- And then we do- Another round down, and it's safe to say- Let's see, do we- I don't think we- Okay, we can sell this and get- This lifesteal.

7773
05:05:10,970 --> 05:05:13,570
So then we can have- Weapon power and weapon lifesteal.

7774
05:05:13,970 --> 05:05:14,350
Yeah.

7775
05:05:16,090 --> 05:05:16,550
Alright.

7776
05:05:18,730 --> 05:05:19,430
That's fine.

7777
05:05:19,450 --> 05:05:20,090
I'm tanking.

7778
05:05:20,210 --> 05:05:21,030
That's all they need to know.

7779
05:05:21,590 --> 05:05:21,950
Alright.

7780
05:05:22,210 --> 05:05:23,650
You guys wanna see a coolant spray?

7781
05:05:25,570 --> 05:05:26,630
Oh, not that one.

7782
05:05:26,630 --> 05:05:29,510
This one isn't- Isn't- It's so beautiful!

7783
05:05:29,810 --> 05:05:32,350
Who wants to send a secure up tree with me?

7784
05:05:32,590 --> 05:05:34,770
Only if you're top 500- The- hahaha

7785
05:05:41,070 --> 05:05:41,670
No!

7786
05:05:42,590 --> 05:05:45,270
This is a top 500 exclusive spray.

7787
05:05:49,180 --> 05:05:50,900
You guys were wondering why I do this?

7788
05:05:51,100 --> 05:05:52,040
It makes you go faster.

7789
05:05:53,200 --> 05:05:55,140
It's like an old Zarya attack.

7790
05:05:55,660 --> 05:05:57,420
You travel faster if you do it.

7791
05:06:00,000 --> 05:06:00,820
That's good.

7792
05:06:01,420 --> 05:06:02,000
Nice.

7793
05:06:04,620 --> 05:06:06,240
I didn't see her over here.

7794
05:06:06,660 --> 05:06:08,100
But she's not shooting me.

7795
05:06:08,700 --> 05:06:09,320
What the heck?

7796
05:06:11,760 --> 05:06:12,320
Alright.

7797
05:06:14,960 --> 05:06:16,920
Oh my god, they just stopped shooting me!

7798
05:06:17,040 --> 05:06:18,920
I have to actually bubble my teammates now.

7799
05:06:19,720 --> 05:06:20,960
That's no fun!

7800
05:06:21,560 --> 05:06:23,340
I don't wanna bubble teammates.

7801
05:06:27,060 --> 05:06:28,260
Okay, yay!

7802
05:06:28,600 --> 05:06:29,560
My 10 damage!

7803
05:06:30,060 --> 05:06:30,820
Whoopee-doo!

7804
05:06:33,360 --> 05:06:35,280
No one wants to shoot me!

7805
05:06:36,660 --> 05:06:38,220
I don't understand!

7806
05:06:38,580 --> 05:06:39,540
Shoot me, please!

7807
05:06:40,780 --> 05:06:41,720
Oh, man.

7808
05:06:45,810 --> 05:06:46,990
Okay, that's fine.

7809
05:06:47,270 --> 05:06:48,710
No, I can't bubble her.

7810
05:06:49,570 --> 05:06:50,410
It's fine.

7811
05:06:53,590 --> 05:06:54,170
There you go.

7812
05:06:54,450 --> 05:06:57,030
I have to start bubbling my teammates now.

7813
05:06:57,030 --> 05:06:58,570
This is not fair.

7814
05:06:58,790 --> 05:07:00,170
This is not fair!

7815
05:07:03,210 --> 05:07:05,130
I can live a little longer.

7816
05:07:05,390 --> 05:07:05,610
No!

7817
05:07:08,270 --> 05:07:10,350
Everyone doesn't wanna shoot the bubble!

7818
05:07:13,830 --> 05:07:14,930
Okay, I'm sad.

7819
05:07:15,570 --> 05:07:16,730
When did they learn?

7820
05:07:18,290 --> 05:07:19,690
When did they learn?

7821
05:07:20,330 --> 05:07:23,470
I wanna use it on myself, cuz I'm greedy!

7822
05:07:26,150 --> 05:07:26,670
Sigh!

7823
05:07:27,590 --> 05:07:28,390
Alright, Genji.

7824
05:07:28,510 --> 05:07:30,230
I guess I saved bubble for you.

7825
05:07:30,850 --> 05:07:31,610
I guess.

7826
05:07:32,850 --> 05:07:33,890
Genji, go in.

7827
05:07:34,310 --> 05:07:35,490
You're not gonna shoot me.

7828
05:07:35,690 --> 05:07:36,150
Go in.

7829
05:07:38,850 --> 05:07:39,710
There you go.

7830
05:07:40,570 --> 05:07:41,170
I mean, that's good.

7831
05:07:43,090 --> 05:07:44,290
Genji, go in, please.

7832
05:07:45,170 --> 05:07:46,210
Genji, go in.

7833
05:07:46,210 --> 05:07:48,550
I'm literally saving it for you.

7834
05:07:51,470 --> 05:07:52,390
There you go.

7835
05:07:56,890 --> 05:07:57,870
Oh my god, please!

7836
05:07:58,130 --> 05:08:00,010
Oh my god, that was a huge ult!

7837
05:08:00,250 --> 05:08:00,550
Yes!

7838
05:08:01,810 --> 05:08:03,910
Please do not die to bomb!

7839
05:08:05,290 --> 05:08:07,690
Are you serious, soldier?

7840
05:08:08,470 --> 05:08:10,290
You died to bomb!

7841
05:08:17,050 --> 05:08:18,710
Oh my god!

7842
05:08:19,410 --> 05:08:21,990
That was such a big ult, too!

7843
05:08:22,250 --> 05:08:24,950
And our soldier ran into the bomb!

7844
05:08:29,240 --> 05:08:31,180
There you go, I had to...

7845
05:08:31,180 --> 05:08:33,140
Oh, I got split, but that's okay.

7846
05:08:33,860 --> 05:08:35,120
As long as...

7847
05:08:35,700 --> 05:08:37,540
As long as I get healed, right?

7848
05:08:37,860 --> 05:08:38,700
That's okay.

7849
05:08:39,860 --> 05:08:40,380
That's...

7850
05:08:43,620 --> 05:08:45,600
Okay, I'm just saying, I am...

7851
05:08:46,320 --> 05:08:51,380
I'm just saying, I might be doing the most stuff for my team.

7852
05:08:51,920 --> 05:08:53,400
Meow, thank you for the hundred biddies!

7853
05:08:53,640 --> 05:08:55,060
Thank you, thank you!

7854
05:08:56,020 --> 05:08:57,960
Yeah, you can really tell!

7855
05:08:58,460 --> 05:08:59,540
Yeah, you can!

7856
05:08:59,540 --> 05:08:59,660
Yeah!

7857
05:09:04,480 --> 05:09:05,120
Okay.

7858
05:09:06,480 --> 05:09:07,120
Alright.

7859
05:09:08,260 --> 05:09:09,460
Okay, weapon power.

7860
05:09:09,840 --> 05:09:10,820
Okay, we gotta do...

7861
05:09:11,380 --> 05:09:13,480
Okay, we should be able to afford...

7862
05:09:14,380 --> 05:09:15,940
Stronger weapon power now.

7863
05:09:17,280 --> 05:09:18,560
50... 20%...

7864
05:09:19,160 --> 05:09:20,780
10% crit damage.

7865
05:09:20,960 --> 05:09:22,020
Okay, 13,000.

7866
05:09:22,260 --> 05:09:23,540
If I sell...

7867
05:09:26,040 --> 05:09:27,320
13,000...

7868
05:09:27,320 --> 05:09:27,840
11, 12.

7869
05:09:27,960 --> 05:09:29,240
Okay, I need to sell one of these.

7870
05:09:30,500 --> 05:09:32,640
Sell lifesteal so I can get...

7871
05:09:33,340 --> 05:09:33,840
This.

7872
05:09:35,000 --> 05:09:37,080
I can get 20% weapon power.

7873
05:09:37,520 --> 05:09:40,020
And then I can buy lifesteal here.

7874
05:09:42,020 --> 05:09:43,020
And then...

7875
05:09:43,020 --> 05:09:43,760
What do we get here?

7876
05:09:44,200 --> 05:09:45,180
For power?

7877
05:09:47,980 --> 05:09:49,360
What should we get in chat?

7878
05:09:53,060 --> 05:09:54,300
Oh, I can do this!

7879
05:09:55,020 --> 05:09:56,380
Is the fishing field good?

7880
05:09:56,400 --> 05:09:57,180
Or should I get better?

7881
05:09:57,300 --> 05:09:57,760
Something better?

7882
05:10:02,920 --> 05:10:04,420
It's a fierce competition...

7883
05:10:04,420 --> 05:10:05,400
Which one's better, guys?

7884
05:10:06,480 --> 05:10:07,180
And who...

7885
05:10:07,180 --> 05:10:07,960
Piercing beam?

7886
05:10:08,120 --> 05:10:08,420
Low...

7887
05:10:08,420 --> 05:10:08,960
No limits?

7888
05:10:09,160 --> 05:10:09,800
Pre-workout?

7889
05:10:09,960 --> 05:10:10,760
Particle accelerator?

7890
05:10:11,420 --> 05:10:12,420
Major flex?

7891
05:10:12,760 --> 05:10:13,780
Barrier benefits?

7892
05:10:14,100 --> 05:10:15,160
Or fishing field?

7893
05:10:19,620 --> 05:10:20,500
Follow your...

7894
05:10:20,500 --> 05:10:20,820
Guys!

7895
05:10:21,080 --> 05:10:23,200
You know my brain can't follow my heart!

7896
05:10:23,920 --> 05:10:26,980
My brain has nothing inside and my heart has...

7897
05:10:26,980 --> 05:10:28,160
Nothing as well.

7898
05:10:28,160 --> 05:10:29,940
I'm dead inside.

7899
05:10:30,280 --> 05:10:30,840
I...

7900
05:10:32,120 --> 05:10:32,680
Guys!

7901
05:10:32,780 --> 05:10:33,060
Please!

7902
05:10:34,440 --> 05:10:36,440
Not long now until the team's...

7903
05:10:36,440 --> 05:10:37,220
I don't know what...

7904
05:10:37,220 --> 05:10:38,280
Oh, I'm doing pre-workout.

7905
05:10:39,060 --> 05:10:40,380
I'm doing pre-workout.

7906
05:10:40,520 --> 05:10:40,800
I'm doing pre-workout.

7907
05:10:40,800 --> 05:10:40,840
I...

7908
05:10:40,840 --> 05:10:41,620
I'll do lifesteal.

7909
05:10:47,480 --> 05:10:48,740
I'm just a shell.

7910
05:10:51,420 --> 05:10:51,980
Alright.

7911
05:10:52,260 --> 05:10:54,120
Commencing attack on objective B.

7912
05:10:55,160 --> 05:10:56,860
I'm so fast with this.

7913
05:10:58,840 --> 05:10:59,400
Guys!

7914
05:10:59,440 --> 05:11:01,160
Everybody else can, like, have mobility.

7915
05:11:01,340 --> 05:11:01,920
And I just...

7916
05:11:01,920 --> 05:11:03,700
Fucking have to do this and hurt myself.

7917
05:11:04,200 --> 05:11:04,840
Haha!

7918
05:11:05,320 --> 05:11:07,460
The objective comes live in ten!

7919
05:11:12,940 --> 05:11:13,740
That's good.

7920
05:11:15,160 --> 05:11:16,000
Oh my god.

7921
05:11:16,100 --> 05:11:18,060
I used both bubbles there and they...

7922
05:11:18,060 --> 05:11:18,700
None of them took...

7923
05:11:18,700 --> 05:11:19,380
And he faded.

7924
05:11:19,680 --> 05:11:20,660
He faded.

7925
05:11:20,880 --> 05:11:22,100
I'm so sad.

7926
05:11:23,180 --> 05:11:24,320
I'm so sad.

7927
05:11:27,380 --> 05:11:28,360
There he is.

7928
05:11:32,420 --> 05:11:33,060
Nice.

7929
05:11:33,280 --> 05:11:33,820
Okay, that's good.

7930
05:11:36,740 --> 05:11:37,380
Please.

7931
05:11:40,870 --> 05:11:42,850
I gotta use it on myself.

7932
05:11:45,830 --> 05:11:47,230
Jesus Christ.

7933
05:11:48,030 --> 05:11:48,330
No!

7934
05:11:48,650 --> 05:11:49,410
The f... No!

7935
05:11:49,650 --> 05:11:50,950
The Nate does...

7936
05:11:50,950 --> 05:11:52,050
What?

7937
05:11:52,410 --> 05:11:55,230
The Nate can do, like, extra damage?

7938
05:11:56,030 --> 05:11:56,770
What?

7939
05:11:59,590 --> 05:12:00,350
Okay.

7940
05:12:00,990 --> 05:12:01,830
I'm sad.

7941
05:12:02,410 --> 05:12:03,550
I'm sad.

7942
05:12:03,750 --> 05:12:06,470
I tracked that Genji so well.

7943
05:12:06,950 --> 05:12:09,530
It does, like, after damage there.

7944
05:12:11,010 --> 05:12:12,770
The objective's online.

7945
05:12:14,210 --> 05:12:15,070
I swear.

7946
05:12:18,410 --> 05:12:19,730
I... Mora?

7947
05:12:24,890 --> 05:12:25,930
Nice, okay.

7948
05:12:32,700 --> 05:12:34,740
Oh my god, I...

7949
05:12:35,460 --> 05:12:38,040
My team's dead, so I don't know.

7950
05:12:40,560 --> 05:12:42,480
I lived for so long.

7951
05:12:42,820 --> 05:12:44,760
My team's dead, I don't know what to do.

7952
05:12:44,760 --> 05:12:46,040
I... I...

7953
05:12:46,040 --> 05:12:47,420
They have poison names?

7954
05:12:47,440 --> 05:12:48,640
Oh my god.

7955
05:12:50,560 --> 05:12:53,460
I did the best I could for my team.

7956
05:12:54,820 --> 05:12:56,060
Which is not...

7957
05:12:56,060 --> 05:12:57,440
Which is a lot, honestly.

7958
05:12:57,700 --> 05:12:59,000
Honestly, it was a lot.

7959
05:12:59,280 --> 05:13:00,960
Now that I think about it...

7960
05:13:00,960 --> 05:13:02,600
Why are you not peeking?

7961
05:13:02,760 --> 05:13:03,800
Oh my god, okay.

7962
05:13:03,800 --> 05:13:03,880
Okay.

7963
05:13:08,370 --> 05:13:09,050
Oh my god.

7964
05:13:09,190 --> 05:13:09,550
Where...

7965
05:13:09,550 --> 05:13:10,470
Where is this...

7966
05:13:10,470 --> 05:13:11,390
Coming from?

7967
05:13:13,490 --> 05:13:14,210
Jesus.

7968
05:13:14,450 --> 05:13:14,610
Okay.

7969
05:13:15,870 --> 05:13:17,290
No, do not peek.

7970
05:13:19,370 --> 05:13:20,090
Okay.

7971
05:13:20,390 --> 05:13:21,030
Now we peek.

7972
05:13:27,270 --> 05:13:28,110
Are you...

7973
05:13:28,110 --> 05:13:29,250
Oh my...

7974
05:13:29,250 --> 05:13:30,790
Jesus Christ.

7975
05:13:31,990 --> 05:13:32,970
I'll do everything.

7976
05:13:33,250 --> 05:13:34,210
I'll do everything.

7977
05:13:34,390 --> 05:13:34,810
I'll do everything if I need to.

7978
05:13:34,950 --> 05:13:35,410
Just heal me.

7979
05:13:35,570 --> 05:13:35,890
Please.

7980
05:13:36,170 --> 05:13:37,530
That's all I ask for.

7981
05:13:37,830 --> 05:13:38,110
Please.

7982
05:13:38,370 --> 05:13:38,690
I...

7983
05:13:38,690 --> 05:13:39,570
I need heals.

7984
05:13:50,410 --> 05:13:51,930
Oh, thank god.

7985
05:13:52,270 --> 05:13:52,890
Thank god.

7986
05:13:54,350 --> 05:13:55,650
Look at the...

7987
05:13:55,650 --> 05:13:56,850
Look at the gap.

7988
05:13:57,170 --> 05:13:58,550
Look at the money gap.

7989
05:13:58,550 --> 05:14:00,050
Between my teams.

7990
05:14:00,850 --> 05:14:01,670
I can't.

7991
05:14:03,270 --> 05:14:06,870
The money gap between my teams is too crazy.

7992
05:14:09,030 --> 05:14:09,610
Oh.

7993
05:14:11,590 --> 05:14:12,390
Okay.

7994
05:14:13,070 --> 05:14:13,470
Alright.

7995
05:14:13,670 --> 05:14:14,410
Weapon power.

7996
05:14:15,250 --> 05:14:17,250
15% weapon power.

7997
05:14:18,590 --> 05:14:19,250
15% weapon power.

7998
05:14:19,250 --> 05:14:19,690
We'll do...

7999
05:14:20,050 --> 05:14:20,410
Okay.

8000
05:14:21,570 --> 05:14:22,890
25% armor.

8001
05:14:23,590 --> 05:14:25,150
10% weapon power.

8002
05:14:25,890 --> 05:14:27,870
Consumes 20% up to...

8003
05:14:27,870 --> 05:14:28,430
For your current...

8004
05:14:28,430 --> 05:14:28,590
Okay.

8005
05:14:28,830 --> 05:14:30,090
Which one do we get for epic?

8006
05:14:30,630 --> 05:14:30,910
Uh...

8007
05:14:30,910 --> 05:14:32,010
10% attack speed.

8008
05:14:32,610 --> 05:14:33,650
Weapon power.

8009
05:14:35,250 --> 05:14:37,290
Get armor and attack speed.

8010
05:14:37,850 --> 05:14:38,730
We get...

8011
05:14:39,090 --> 05:14:40,030
25%...

8012
05:14:40,030 --> 05:14:42,210
25% armor and 10% weapon power.

8013
05:14:42,210 --> 05:14:44,670
We've already seen so much action.

8014
05:14:44,970 --> 05:14:46,410
And there's still more to come.

8015
05:14:48,090 --> 05:14:48,570
Alright.

8016
05:14:48,750 --> 05:14:49,310
We'll do that.

8017
05:14:49,530 --> 05:14:51,450
And then we can...

8018
05:14:51,990 --> 05:14:54,130
And then we should have more weapon power.

8019
05:14:54,370 --> 05:14:55,190
We're like just...

8020
05:14:55,190 --> 05:14:55,810
Just a tank.

8021
05:14:55,990 --> 05:14:56,130
Yes.

8022
05:14:56,290 --> 05:14:57,910
We're just so tanky right now.

8023
05:15:00,750 --> 05:15:01,270
Jesus.

8024
05:15:02,370 --> 05:15:05,110
I am literally out playing their...

8025
05:15:05,110 --> 05:15:06,950
I'm out playing their team.

8026
05:15:06,950 --> 05:15:07,710
So hard.

8027
05:15:07,830 --> 05:15:08,310
I'm sad.

8028
05:15:09,630 --> 05:15:10,270
I'm sad.

8029
05:15:10,950 --> 05:15:12,450
Soldier and Genji.

8030
05:15:12,550 --> 05:15:12,810
Please.

8031
05:15:13,310 --> 05:15:14,750
I will...

8032
05:15:14,750 --> 05:15:15,870
Eventually double your points.

8033
05:15:16,270 --> 05:15:16,390
Please.

8034
05:15:18,850 --> 05:15:19,390
Please.

8035
05:15:19,630 --> 05:15:20,490
Genji and Soldier.

8036
05:15:20,870 --> 05:15:21,810
That's all I ask.

8037
05:15:29,060 --> 05:15:29,600
Alright.

8038
05:15:29,740 --> 05:15:30,140
Here you go.

8039
05:15:34,190 --> 05:15:35,790
And you guys are so fast.

8040
05:15:35,910 --> 05:15:37,130
Look at how slow I am.

8041
05:15:37,590 --> 05:15:39,250
I'm just a little Zarya.

8042
05:15:39,970 --> 05:15:41,870
Look how slow I am.

8043
05:15:42,970 --> 05:15:43,450
Please.

8044
05:15:44,790 --> 05:15:46,490
What do you want me to do?

8045
05:15:48,310 --> 05:15:48,790
Okay.

8046
05:15:50,650 --> 05:15:51,130
Okay.

8047
05:15:51,250 --> 05:15:51,470
That's...

8048
05:15:51,470 --> 05:15:52,490
I have to use double there.

8049
05:15:52,950 --> 05:15:53,910
That's the only way.

8050
05:15:58,870 --> 05:15:59,350
Please.

8051
05:15:59,930 --> 05:16:01,930
Please peek me so I can give you...

8052
05:16:07,600 --> 05:16:08,600
I blocked him.

8053
05:16:11,280 --> 05:16:11,760
Okay.

8054
05:16:11,960 --> 05:16:12,160
Nice.

8055
05:16:16,460 --> 05:16:16,940
Okay.

8056
05:16:20,360 --> 05:16:21,180
There you go.

8057
05:16:21,420 --> 05:16:22,560
Push the cart!

8058
05:16:24,380 --> 05:16:25,640
Push the cart!

8059
05:16:27,400 --> 05:16:27,880
Alright.

8060
05:16:35,240 --> 05:16:35,880
There you go.

8061
05:16:35,960 --> 05:16:37,400
I predicted they were gonna shoot me there.

8062
05:16:43,010 --> 05:16:43,690
Oh my god.

8063
05:16:43,730 --> 05:16:43,950
Nice.

8064
05:16:45,930 --> 05:16:46,710
Please hit me.

8065
05:16:46,870 --> 05:16:47,250
Please.

8066
05:16:58,300 --> 05:16:59,300
Oh my god.

8067
05:17:01,160 --> 05:17:01,640
Please.

8068
05:17:01,640 --> 05:17:02,040
Oh my god.

8069
05:17:02,220 --> 05:17:02,440
Please.

8070
05:17:08,460 --> 05:17:08,940
Oh.

8071
05:17:09,180 --> 05:17:10,680
How much more do I have to do?

8072
05:17:13,800 --> 05:17:14,280
Oh.

8073
05:17:14,640 --> 05:17:14,940
Nice.

8074
05:17:15,320 --> 05:17:16,540
I needed that fire too.

8075
05:17:22,900 --> 05:17:23,380
Nice.

8076
05:17:23,620 --> 05:17:23,720
Okay.

8077
05:17:23,860 --> 05:17:24,020
100.

8078
05:17:24,600 --> 05:17:25,040
Oh no.

8079
05:17:30,130 --> 05:17:30,610
Please.

8080
05:17:30,850 --> 05:17:31,090
No.

8081
05:17:34,050 --> 05:17:35,710
I gotta get that lifesteal.

8082
05:17:35,870 --> 05:17:37,070
I gotta get that lifesteal.

8083
05:17:46,040 --> 05:17:46,520
Damage!

8084
05:17:51,240 --> 05:17:51,720
100%.

8085
05:17:54,620 --> 05:17:55,100
Jesus.

8086
05:17:57,640 --> 05:17:59,240
Yeah, you better be sorry.

8087
05:18:02,360 --> 05:18:05,100
You better be god damn sorry.

8088
05:18:12,080 --> 05:18:12,860
Oh my god.

8089
05:18:12,980 --> 05:18:13,820
I thought he would hit me.

8090
05:18:13,980 --> 05:18:14,680
But I guess not.

8091
05:18:15,320 --> 05:18:17,420
I should have known he was gonna shoot at my soldier.

8092
05:18:18,440 --> 05:18:19,500
How they were playing.

8093
05:18:24,220 --> 05:18:24,720
Okay.

8094
05:18:24,840 --> 05:18:24,900
Okay.

8095
05:18:24,900 --> 05:18:26,080
They learned to stop hitting me.

8096
05:18:34,010 --> 05:18:34,510
Okay.

8097
05:18:45,070 --> 05:18:45,910
You're dying.

8098
05:18:46,090 --> 05:18:46,550
You're gonna die.

8099
05:18:46,670 --> 05:18:47,190
I don't care.

8100
05:18:47,570 --> 05:18:48,570
I don't care.

8101
05:18:51,550 --> 05:18:52,750
I don't care.

8102
05:18:53,690 --> 05:18:55,170
I don't care.

8103
05:18:55,350 --> 05:18:56,850
I don't care.

8104
05:18:56,850 --> 05:18:56,970
I don't care.

8105
05:18:57,190 --> 05:19:18,530
I don't care.

8106
05:19:18,530 --> 05:19:20,290
I still... because I'm not getting healed.

8107
05:19:20,890 --> 05:19:21,390
I...

8108
05:19:23,870 --> 05:19:24,370
Okay.

8109
05:19:24,990 --> 05:19:26,190
Alright, let's see.

8110
05:19:26,430 --> 05:19:27,890
Okay, let's get rid of this.

8111
05:19:28,190 --> 05:19:30,910
And then grab more power, I guess.

8112
05:19:36,510 --> 05:19:38,510
Let's see, 25%.

8113
05:19:40,270 --> 05:19:43,610
Alright, let's get rid of attack speed so I can buy this.

8114
05:19:43,850 --> 05:19:44,650
And then, alright, power.

8115
05:19:45,090 --> 05:19:46,310
What do we... okay, what do we get?

8116
05:19:47,990 --> 05:19:49,570
Above... will pierce enemies.

8117
05:19:50,690 --> 05:19:52,890
Maximum energy increase to 150.

8118
05:19:53,190 --> 05:19:54,890
Oh, I'm never getting 150.

8119
05:20:01,210 --> 05:20:03,530
Ability purple third row high.

8120
05:20:07,920 --> 05:20:09,080
Get fantastic.

8121
05:20:09,660 --> 05:20:09,780
What?

8122
05:20:12,500 --> 05:20:15,380
Did you know that?

8123
05:20:16,440 --> 05:20:17,340
Alright, what do we get?

8124
05:20:17,740 --> 05:20:19,120
We have...

8125
05:20:19,120 --> 05:20:20,360
What do we get, guys?

8126
05:20:20,520 --> 05:20:21,040
Major flex?

8127
05:20:26,280 --> 05:20:27,300
What do we do?

8128
05:20:29,040 --> 05:20:30,040
Barrett benefits.

8129
05:20:30,500 --> 05:20:31,260
Fish and field.

8130
05:20:31,520 --> 05:20:32,860
Guys, we gotta figure this out!

8131
05:20:37,600 --> 05:20:38,480
Major flex?

8132
05:20:38,800 --> 05:20:39,280
Which one is?

8133
05:20:39,340 --> 05:20:39,900
Is this one?

8134
05:20:40,100 --> 05:20:40,380
Alright.

8135
05:20:41,720 --> 05:20:42,240
Alright.

8136
05:20:46,800 --> 05:20:47,960
Now I know why.

8137
05:20:48,540 --> 05:20:50,180
How do they have more money?

8138
05:20:50,320 --> 05:20:52,260
They have more money than me!

8139
05:20:52,260 --> 05:20:55,460
Because their team's actually doing more as a team.

8140
05:20:56,140 --> 05:20:59,160
And I'm nearly the raid boss that they have to kill.

8141
05:21:03,120 --> 05:21:03,800
I'm...

8142
05:21:03,800 --> 05:21:07,120
I'm the raid boss they have to kill as a team.

8143
05:21:09,000 --> 05:21:11,220
They have more money than me though.

8144
05:21:13,460 --> 05:21:14,140
Somehow.

8145
05:21:14,140 --> 05:21:14,280
Now.

8146
05:21:17,060 --> 05:21:18,260
Where are they?

8147
05:21:22,850 --> 05:21:24,170
Where are they?

8148
05:21:28,700 --> 05:21:29,790
Where are they?

8149
05:21:30,550 --> 05:21:32,110
Where are they playing?

8150
05:21:42,040 --> 05:21:43,640
Jesus, they're so fast.

8151
05:21:44,260 --> 05:21:45,240
They're actually so...

8152
05:21:45,240 --> 05:21:46,400
They're so fast!

8153
05:21:48,180 --> 05:21:49,940
Oh my...

8154
05:21:49,940 --> 05:21:51,240
Everybody is so fast!

8155
05:21:54,700 --> 05:21:56,180
Oh my...

8156
05:21:56,180 --> 05:21:56,220
Everybody is so fast!

8157
05:21:56,220 --> 05:21:57,460
What is going on?

8158
05:22:05,700 --> 05:22:06,980
I won?

8159
05:22:09,720 --> 05:22:11,480
I don't...

8160
05:22:11,920 --> 05:22:13,060
Why is he...

8161
05:22:13,060 --> 05:22:15,820
Why is everyone so fast?

8162
05:22:15,820 --> 05:22:15,940
What is that?

8163
05:22:20,060 --> 05:22:20,640
Jesus!

8164
05:22:20,980 --> 05:22:22,280
I guess I'll kill him!

8165
05:22:26,400 --> 05:22:26,980
I...

8166
05:22:26,980 --> 05:22:27,660
I don't know.

8167
05:22:28,080 --> 05:22:28,660
I...

8168
05:22:36,090 --> 05:22:36,670
Everyone...

8169
05:22:36,670 --> 05:22:38,690
I don't know what's going on.

8170
05:22:39,290 --> 05:22:39,870
I...

8171
05:22:40,530 --> 05:22:41,110
Okay.

8172
05:22:42,690 --> 05:22:44,270
I'll move up, I guess.

8173
05:22:56,450 --> 05:22:57,250
There we go.

8174
05:22:58,510 --> 05:22:59,630
Oh my god.

8175
05:23:00,010 --> 05:23:01,010
That was the clone.

8176
05:23:01,530 --> 05:23:02,350
Okay, we won.

8177
05:23:05,830 --> 05:23:06,590
Oh no.

8178
05:23:08,010 --> 05:23:09,770
Please, I only have 35!

8179
05:23:14,690 --> 05:23:15,390
That's right.

8180
05:23:16,470 --> 05:23:17,710
I don't care about you.

8181
05:23:19,030 --> 05:23:21,190
Please, I need more energy, please!

8182
05:23:23,010 --> 05:23:23,790
There we go.

8183
05:23:25,930 --> 05:23:27,710
I will kill you.

8184
05:23:28,870 --> 05:23:31,130
Oh my god!

8185
05:23:33,710 --> 05:23:36,450
Alright, now I know why Zarya is broken.

8186
05:23:36,890 --> 05:23:37,310
I...

8187
05:23:37,310 --> 05:23:38,790
Man!

8188
05:23:39,910 --> 05:23:43,210
Now you can't kill the raid boss!

8189
05:23:46,630 --> 05:23:48,150
Oh, that's me!

8190
05:23:48,570 --> 05:23:52,310
What are the 20 different things I did in this game?

8191
05:23:52,310 --> 05:23:52,770
Like...

8192
05:23:53,310 --> 05:23:54,010
Oh yeah!

8193
05:23:54,210 --> 05:23:54,650
This one!

8194
05:23:58,050 --> 05:24:00,870
While Zarya eats her ass!

8195
05:24:04,010 --> 05:24:06,010
Just get good, I guess.

8196
05:24:06,530 --> 05:24:07,510
Oh no!

8197
05:24:08,310 --> 05:24:08,530
Oh!

8198
05:24:08,890 --> 05:24:09,710
I can't...

8199
05:24:09,710 --> 05:24:11,090
I can't talk to people.

8200
05:24:11,330 --> 05:24:13,530
Cause sometimes I'm worried I get too toxic.

8201
05:24:13,530 --> 05:24:13,990
I...

8202
05:24:13,990 --> 05:24:14,310
I...

8203
05:24:17,830 --> 05:24:18,270
Okay.

8204
05:24:19,610 --> 05:24:20,050
Um...

8205
05:24:20,050 --> 05:24:20,510
Alright.

8206
05:24:21,530 --> 05:24:22,670
Yeah, I have to make sure I...

8207
05:24:23,550 --> 05:24:24,430
Toxicity removed!

8208
05:24:25,210 --> 05:24:26,830
Alright, I think that's what you're getting the end on.

8209
05:24:26,910 --> 05:24:28,890
Unless you're like, great, now!

8210
05:24:30,670 --> 05:24:33,170
That's why I turned my socials off, guys!

8211
05:24:33,170 --> 05:24:34,270
I turned...

8212
05:24:34,270 --> 05:24:36,430
I made sure I don't talk to people!

8213
05:24:37,050 --> 05:24:38,430
Stay away from chat!

8214
05:24:38,810 --> 05:24:39,930
It was like...

8215
05:24:39,930 --> 05:24:41,870
Chat channel is disabled!

8216
05:24:42,390 --> 05:24:42,630
Whoops!

8217
05:24:42,970 --> 05:24:43,270
You're...

8218
05:24:43,270 --> 05:24:44,710
Good job, Pastoki!

8219
05:24:45,090 --> 05:24:47,530
Good job for saving yourself!

8220
05:24:52,070 --> 05:24:53,150
Oh man!

8221
05:24:53,370 --> 05:24:53,850
That was fun!

8222
05:24:54,210 --> 05:24:54,870
I had...

8223
05:24:54,870 --> 05:24:55,770
Uh...

8224
05:24:55,770 --> 05:24:57,130
I had a lot of fun!

8225
05:24:58,190 --> 05:24:58,910
Uh...

8226
05:24:58,910 --> 05:25:05,050
Pastoki knew this time will come when Pastoki went a little too toxic!

8227
05:25:09,850 --> 05:25:14,010
I will say, Sadio was definitely incredibly fun!

8228
05:25:14,010 --> 05:25:14,550
Um...

8229
05:25:14,550 --> 05:25:14,830
But yes!

8230
05:25:15,650 --> 05:25:16,210
Um...

8231
05:25:16,210 --> 05:25:18,070
Huge shout out to...

8232
05:25:18,070 --> 05:25:18,470
Um...

8233
05:25:18,470 --> 05:25:20,550

8235
05:25:21,950 --> 05:25:23,050

Stadium in general!

8240
05:25:27,930 --> 05:25:30,050
Doing all the random builds and everything!

8241
05:25:30,510 --> 05:25:30,690
Uh...

8242
05:25:30,690 --> 05:25:32,030
It was definitely a great time!

8243
05:25:32,650 --> 05:25:33,070
Um...

8244
05:25:33,070 --> 05:25:34,530

8246
05:25:35,490 --> 05:25:35,850
Uh...

And pin in chat!

8248
05:25:37,310 --> 05:25:37,870
And...

8249
05:25:37,870 --> 05:25:38,350
Uh...

8250
05:25:38,350 --> 05:25:39,090
With the command!

8251
05:25:39,290 --> 05:25:40,330
Exclamation point Overwatch!

8252
05:25:40,730 --> 05:25:42,370
I had a great time!

8253
05:25:42,990 --> 05:25:43,550
Um...

8254
05:25:44,450 --> 05:25:45,430
Checking out everything!

8255
05:25:45,930 --> 05:25:47,370
As someone who hasn't played Overwatch in a while!

8256
05:25:47,570 --> 05:25:48,290
Going back in it!

8257
05:25:48,770 --> 05:25:48,890
I...

8258
05:25:48,890 --> 05:25:52,190
I now understand why Stadium is more fun right now!

8259
05:25:52,290 --> 05:25:53,190
Versus like what...

8260
05:25:53,190 --> 05:25:54,470
What there is at the moment!

8261
05:25:55,050 --> 05:25:55,330
Um...

8262
05:25:55,330 --> 05:25:56,530
Versus like regular rank!

8263
05:25:56,710 --> 05:25:56,910
Uh...

8264
05:25:56,910 --> 05:25:57,830
I would say Stadium...

8265
05:25:57,830 --> 05:25:58,410
For me personally!

8266
05:25:58,730 --> 05:26:00,850
It's definitely more fun than regular rank at the moment!

8267
05:26:01,130 --> 05:26:03,730
Only because it's a lot more fast paced!

8268
05:26:03,970 --> 05:26:04,890
And like...

8269
05:26:04,890 --> 05:26:05,370
Um...

8270
05:26:05,370 --> 05:26:07,050
I don't feel like I'm held hostage!

8271
05:26:07,430 --> 05:26:07,690
You know?

8272
05:26:07,890 --> 05:26:08,170
Like...

8273
05:26:08,170 --> 05:26:10,190
You know like when your team is...

8274
05:26:10,190 --> 05:26:10,910
Um...

8275
05:26:10,910 --> 05:26:12,050
When your team is losing!

8276
05:26:12,510 --> 05:26:13,470
And then you're like...

8277
05:26:13,470 --> 05:26:14,510
You don't know what to do!

8278
05:26:14,750 --> 05:26:15,250
And you're like...

8279
05:26:15,250 --> 05:26:16,750
Well this is obviously losable!

8280
05:26:17,150 --> 05:26:18,290
But like with Stadium!

8281
05:26:19,030 --> 05:26:19,510
It...

8282
05:26:19,510 --> 05:26:21,350
The games go by so fast too!

8283
05:26:22,930 --> 05:26:23,410
And...

8284
05:26:40,410 --> 05:26:40,890
Um...

8285
05:26:40,890 --> 05:26:42,190
Obviously make better builds!

8286
05:26:43,370 --> 05:26:43,810
Um...

8287
05:26:43,810 --> 05:26:44,550
And everything!

8288
05:26:44,850 --> 05:26:45,250
And then like...

8289
05:26:45,250 --> 05:26:46,650
The games go by really really fast!

8290
05:26:46,810 --> 05:26:48,030
So like that's where...

8291
05:26:48,030 --> 05:26:49,250
I mean I played five...

8292
05:26:49,250 --> 05:26:49,410
What?

8293
05:26:49,470 --> 05:26:50,750
How many hours did I play of Stadium?

8294
05:26:52,410 --> 05:26:53,150
Oh my god!

8295
05:26:53,170 --> 05:26:53,990
I went overtime!

8296
05:26:55,550 --> 05:26:56,190
For sure!

8297
05:26:56,290 --> 05:26:57,250
How long was I streaming for?

8298
05:26:57,430 --> 05:26:58,530
I streamed five hours!

8299
05:26:58,630 --> 05:27:00,230
I did four hours of Overwatch today!

8300
05:27:01,310 --> 05:27:01,750
Um...

8301
05:27:01,750 --> 05:27:01,990
Um...

8302
05:27:01,990 --> 05:27:04,890
And I think it was like three hours of just purely Stadium!

8303
05:27:05,670 --> 05:27:06,110
And...

8304
05:27:06,110 --> 05:27:06,570
Because I...

8305
05:27:06,570 --> 05:27:07,810
I actually enjoyed it a lot!

8306
05:27:07,930 --> 05:27:08,270
So yeah!

8307
05:27:08,590 --> 05:27:08,850
Uh...

8308
05:27:08,850 --> 05:27:10,030
Definitely thank you again!

8309
05:27:10,510 --> 05:27:10,990
Uh...

8310
05:27:10,990 --> 05:27:12,850
To Overwatch for...

8311
05:27:12,850 --> 05:27:13,570
Um...

8312
05:27:13,570 --> 05:27:14,350
Sponsoring me!

8313
05:27:14,590 --> 05:27:16,430
And being able to show how fun it is!

8314
05:27:16,490 --> 05:27:17,530
The different builds you can do!

8315
05:27:17,750 --> 05:27:20,490
There's like so many different wild builds you can have!

8316
05:27:21,050 --> 05:27:21,410
Um...

8317
05:27:21,410 --> 05:27:22,510
The Zarya one was definitely...

8318
05:27:22,510 --> 05:27:23,110
I now know...

8319
05:27:23,110 --> 05:27:24,210
I know why Zarya is OP!

8320
05:27:27,170 --> 05:27:27,650
I...

8321
05:27:28,270 --> 05:27:31,730
I can tell why Zarya was incredibly OP there!

8322
05:27:32,070 --> 05:27:33,570
Literally I was just walking forward!

8323
05:27:33,830 --> 05:27:34,110
And...

8324
05:27:34,110 --> 05:27:36,410
And like I didn't even need my healers anymore!

8325
05:27:36,410 --> 05:27:36,790
Before...

8326
05:27:36,790 --> 05:27:38,310
I just went lifesteal!

8327
05:27:38,510 --> 05:27:39,450
And I just walked up!

8328
05:27:39,590 --> 05:27:40,290
I was like...

8329
05:27:40,290 --> 05:27:41,810
I don't need you anymore!

8330
05:27:42,070 --> 05:27:43,690
I have lifesteal now!

8331
05:27:44,310 --> 05:27:44,650
I...

8332
05:27:44,650 --> 05:27:44,970
I...

8333
05:27:47,450 --> 05:27:48,030
It's...

8334
05:27:48,030 --> 05:27:48,810
I was like...

8335
05:27:48,810 --> 05:27:51,450
I don't need to cry about heals!

8336
05:27:51,450 --> 05:27:54,770
All I have to do is do damage!

8337
05:27:58,730 --> 05:27:59,570
I...

8338
05:27:59,570 --> 05:28:00,290
I...

8339
05:28:00,290 --> 05:28:01,990
I became the raid boss!

8340
05:28:02,590 --> 05:28:03,110
I am...

8341
05:28:03,110 --> 05:28:05,090
You can heal yourself!

8342
05:28:05,090 --> 05:28:06,870
Who cares about you?

8343
05:28:10,850 --> 05:28:11,290
Um...

8344
05:28:12,230 --> 05:28:12,930
But yes!

8345
05:28:13,570 --> 05:28:14,010
Um...

8346
05:28:14,010 --> 05:28:15,070

05:28:15,070 --> 05:28:16,050
