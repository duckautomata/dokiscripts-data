4
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:09,470
Okay, not me.

00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,760
Pushes everybody out of the way.

9
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:16,960
I have a...

10
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,160
I said Coda from Idol, Gen 2.

11
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:20,440
I'm a dragon.

12
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:21,300
It's pretty cool.

13
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:23,000
Cool.

14
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:23,540
That's it.

15
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:23,980
That's all I got.

16
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:26,560

17
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,980
Thank you, Blushes.

18
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,440
Ah, hello.

19
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,440
My name is Bree.

20
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:31,460
I'm not from Idol.

21
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,500
I'm just me.

22
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,020
I'm a buddy.

23
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,780
I like Elden Ring.

24
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,180
I play a lot of that game.

25
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:40,680
That's it.

26
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,320
That's my entire personality.

27
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:46,480
Thank you for clarifying that you were not from Idol.

28
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,540
I was actually really confused.

29
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,640
I was like, I can't believe we're from my company.

30
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:50,280
Oh, my God.

31
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:50,880
That's crazy.

32
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:52,620
Well, okay.

33
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:57,820
In my defense, in my head, you were going to go, like, Yuna
was going to go after Kai, and then I was going to be like,

34
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,400
oh, my God, I'm not an idol.

35
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,020
And then you were like, go, bring go.

36
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:04,960
I'm like, my rehearsal in my head didn't make sense.

37
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,540
Keep your enemies on their toes.

38
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:11,020
I'm at next.

39
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:12,400

40
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,100
Hello, I'm Buta Juna Unagi from Idol Ian's First Generation
Isakai.

41
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:17,060

And I'm Doki Bird.

46
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,600
I think that's a good enough intro, I think.

47
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,140
I am standing.

48
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:31,480
I'm short and thin enough.

49
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:31,920
It's great.

50
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,220

81
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:21,360
this game is about, this is basically apparently for the
people who tested this game an hour early, they told me it

82
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,000
was like Dead by Daylight and Among Us mixed together.

83
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:28,660
So there's only one person who's the demon that's gonna kill
all of us.

84
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:33,240
And I was the one that suggested a game because I saw there
was a priest and that was the only character I wanted to

85
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:33,540
play.

86
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:36,120
So I was like, Kai was the priest when I got in the waiting
room.

87
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,520
I was like, get the fuck off the priest.

88
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,660

00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:50,150
I healed myself.

166
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:51,390
I just got pills.

167
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:51,950
That's it.

168
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:55,350
I don't think Juna knows what she's doing.

169
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:01,250
Wait, let me bring up my game volume a little bit.

170
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:02,250
Ooh.

171
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:04,230
Okay, I brought up my game volume.

172
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:08,650
Okay, you know, I thought this would be a lot scarier, but
it's kind of not that bad.

173
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:09,610
It's not that bad.

174
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:11,310
I think it's also because we're grouped up together.

175
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:15,570
I don't know I saw I just got a tutorial on how to hide in a
closet.

176
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:24,190
So like we need a fun I think it's also easier right now
because we're together.

177
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:28,810
So we're not as scared I think Junet does not know where the
fuck we are.

178
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:33,450
I Think she's equally as lost.

179
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:35,210
No, it's this demon gets closer.

180
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:46,150
Wait, no, I think she might be nearby Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, I can't No, she's not Is she close to is she still

181
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:46,770

182
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:54,210
What the fuck what's that?

183
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:56,790
Is that June is that you?

184
00:15:57,090 --> 00:16:00,070
Yes, the entire invisible potion.

185
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:01,770
She can't be invisible in here.

186
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:03,390
Oh, apparently she can be invisible.

187
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:09,350
Oh wait, there's a ladder here Whoa, I thought June just
like the biggest heart or something.

188
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:14,370
I got a ladder I don't know what to do with it.

189
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,330
I just got the ladder.

190
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:16,830
Oh, there's more bandages.

191
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:17,090
Wait.

192
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:17,330
Wait.

193
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:17,590
Wait.

194
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:18,370

196
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:20,770
Oh, okay.

197
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:21,330
She inked.

198
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:21,930
I got scared.

199
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:22,310
Okay.

200
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:24,210
It's just some old woman.

00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:25,310
Okay.

Breathe.

205
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:26,350
Breathe.

206
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:27,050
Take the bandage.

207
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:29,170
Take the bandage and like here.

208
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:33,770

213
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:37,670

214
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:38,790
Look at your HP.

Where the fuck is the last altar?

00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,240
It has to be on this floor.

Okay, she is not a coward.

637
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:51,930
She was not a cat.

That's fucking right.

644
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:02,340
What are you doing?

645
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:04,680
What the fuck are you doing?

646
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:07,740
Oh my god, get around!

647
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,200
Oh my god, what is she doing?

648
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:28,180
Bro, she gave you a freebie, bro.

649
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:31,040
Bro, that was like a fucking strip club right there.

650
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:35,960
We were, like, at a bachelor party, and we hired Judah to
have...

651
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,400
And we're like, hey, yeah.

652
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,880
Oh, she was like...

653
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,000
Literally, like, she's, like...

654
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,400
She was, like, straddling your waist.

655
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:44,920
Yeah.

656
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:45,420
And then...

657
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:50,380
And then I felt like we were at a bachelor party, and we're,
like, giving you a nice, like, birth...

658
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:53,420
One last day before you're hitched, bro.

659
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:56,200
You know what, honestly.

660
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:59,900
On my end, it literally just looks like she's beating the
shit out of me.

661
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,740
I'm trying so hard.

662
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:04,760
I'm trying so hard to heal you.

663
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:05,960
Oh my god.

664
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:07,700
Okay, we need one more.

665
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:10,840
There has to be the last fucking altar.

666
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:13,960
We probably like ran around it like a million times.

667
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:14,920
We probably have.

668
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,120
I found one of them.

669
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:17,880
Should we, I hate to say it.

670
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,320
Should we split up?

671
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,800
Okay, how about like since you're...

672
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:22,660
Okay.

673
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:23,700
No, no, no.

674
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:24,600
Okay.

675
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:29,100
Bree should stick with Kai because Kai's the most fucked up
right now.

676
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:29,800
I'll just heal.

677
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:30,700
Okay, I don't have healers.

678
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,020
Okay, if I...

679
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:32,320
Okay.

680
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:33,340
I thought she was gonna say something.

681
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:33,740
Don't worry.

682
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:37,500
I'll split up with you guys and you two find the last altar.

683
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:39,280
All right, are you guys ready?

684
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,120
I'm the only one.

685
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:42,120
Okay, I'm going this way.

686
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:43,980
Yeah, don't worry.

687
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:44,540

00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:40,080
It has to be up top, right?

793
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:44,080
I mean, I assume it's in the...

794
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:45,000
The kitchen, right?

795
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:47,260

00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:47,720

797
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,200

Like, what are you talking about?

932
00:50:10,170 --> 00:50:11,510

933
00:50:13,570 --> 00:50:14,410
We're maxed out.

934
00:50:14,430 --> 00:50:16,190
Is that it?

935
00:50:16,370 --> 00:50:16,810
Did we do it?

936
00:50:16,910 --> 00:50:17,350
Did we win?

937
00:50:17,630 --> 00:50:17,630
Yeah.

938
00:50:18,090 --> 00:50:19,310
I guess we just kill her.

939
00:50:19,970 --> 00:50:20,670
Demon's getting...

940
00:50:20,670 --> 00:50:20,930

00:50:24,330 --> 00:50:25,410
Oh my gosh.

943
00:50:27,150 --> 00:50:28,470
I think we did it.

944
00:50:28,950 --> 00:50:30,770
I think we're supposed to kill her now.

945
00:50:30,970 --> 00:50:31,750
Finally not 1 HP.

946
00:50:32,690 --> 00:50:33,570

947
00:50:34,190 --> 00:50:35,730

00:50:35,970 --> 00:50:37,770
Come over here and kill us!

949
00:50:38,470 --> 00:50:38,990
Literally!

950
00:50:39,430 --> 00:50:40,910
We did everything!

951
00:50:43,210 --> 00:50:43,850
You won't!

952
00:50:44,810 --> 00:50:46,110
Come on, Juna.

953
00:50:46,310 --> 00:50:47,910
We're literally out in the open.

954
00:50:48,190 --> 00:50:49,310
I shot her every time.

955
00:50:51,510 --> 00:50:52,350
It's time.

956
00:50:53,090 --> 00:50:57,030
Someone in my chat said that she can't heal anymore is what
we did.

957
00:50:57,470 --> 00:51:00,170
So she's just like at that HP and she can't go higher.

958
00:51:00,930 --> 00:51:01,770
Oh, that's right.

959
00:51:02,290 --> 00:51:03,210

984
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:08,170
Get back here!

985
00:52:08,510 --> 00:52:09,130

988
00:52:14,430 --> 00:52:15,110

00:52:29,490 --> 00:52:30,750
We did it!

997
00:52:31,110 --> 00:52:31,330
We did it!

998
00:52:31,330 --> 00:52:33,950
Oh shit, wait, just fucking...

999
00:52:33,950 --> 00:52:34,310
Hello?

1000
00:52:34,710 --> 00:52:35,690
Huge, hello!

1001
00:52:36,230 --> 00:52:36,510
Hello?

1002
00:52:37,250 --> 00:52:40,470
It just kind of like how it just kicks us out of the game.

1003
00:52:41,310 --> 00:52:42,410
It really kicked you.

1004
00:52:42,430 --> 00:52:43,110
Wait, it kicked you out?

1005
00:52:44,550 --> 00:52:45,150
The kingdom.

1006
00:52:46,430 --> 00:52:46,810
I'm solid.

1007
00:52:47,570 --> 00:52:48,170
Oh my god.

1008
00:52:48,190 --> 00:52:49,750
It's the same lobby?

1009
00:52:50,510 --> 00:52:51,230
Yeah, same lobby.

1010
00:52:51,430 --> 00:52:51,950
Okay, okay.

1011
00:52:52,810 --> 00:52:52,910
Okay.

1012
00:52:54,470 --> 00:52:56,610
How was it, Juno, being the demon?

1013
00:52:56,810 --> 00:52:57,530
Yeah, what is it?

1014
00:52:57,530 --> 00:52:59,770
I was like, bro, like, how do I do the abilities?

1015
00:52:59,950 --> 00:53:02,130
And they're like, oh, you have to press like the, like F1,
F2.

1016
00:53:02,210 --> 00:53:05,350
And I was like, oh, but then I realized there was a fucking
scroll wheel, like at the end of the fucking game.

1017
00:53:05,450 --> 00:53:08,570
So the reason why I would just like stop and stand in front
of you guys.

1018
00:53:08,930 --> 00:53:11,130
And they're like, okay, I depressed F6 now.

1019
00:53:13,090 --> 00:53:14,330
Oh my god.

1020
00:53:15,370 --> 00:53:18,430
Bro, why do you you you guys want to die?

1021
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:23,370
I was killing them.

1022
00:53:23,730 --> 00:53:24,590
I did my job.

1023
00:53:25,130 --> 00:53:25,930
You killed you.

1024
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:28,170
And then you're still a killing.

1025
00:53:28,950 --> 00:53:30,310
What the fuck do you mean?

1026
00:53:30,810 --> 00:53:34,290
I can't believe you guys are inting in my race.

1027
00:53:34,690 --> 00:53:34,970
What is it?

1028
00:53:34,970 --> 00:53:35,470
What the fuck is it?

1029
00:53:35,690 --> 00:53:36,950
So it's being retro.

1030
00:53:38,390 --> 00:53:40,710
I can't fucking I can't believe this.

1031
00:53:40,950 --> 00:53:44,350
I can't believe you're inting in my high elo.

1032
00:53:44,910 --> 00:53:45,770
I don't know.

1033
00:53:45,930 --> 00:53:48,750
It just sounds like somebody who's just got skilled dived.

1034
00:53:49,030 --> 00:53:49,270
No!

1035
00:53:50,930 --> 00:53:52,630
But it was funny in the beginning.

1036
00:53:52,830 --> 00:53:54,830
B was like, oh, I read the instructions.

1037
00:53:55,010 --> 00:53:58,510
Like, she could kill NPCs, but she doesn't know if I was
standing in the same room as you guys.

1038
00:53:58,790 --> 00:54:00,670
I can hear you guys.

1039

You couldn't even hear us.

1042
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:10,700
The visibility potion works.

1043
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:12,280
I was saving it everywhere.

1044
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:15,760

00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:54,980
Technology is your friend.

1061
00:55:55,380 --> 00:55:59,440
Install cameras, use various sensors, and weaken the demon
with advanced tool.

1062
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:01,060
I don't even know if I can do that.

1063
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:02,840
So it's such advanced tool.

1064
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:03,360
Okay.

1065
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:06,160

Earn.

1067
00:56:14,540 --> 00:56:18,200
I don't think I've seen any of these things in that game we
play.

1068
00:56:18,860 --> 00:56:19,640
Oh, I don't know.

00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:45,800
Surveillance camera.

1089
00:57:46,620 --> 00:57:47,680

1090
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:48,740
There you go.

00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:51,840
Yeah, no, the monster had the, the monster had push to talk.

Guys, I don't...

1098
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,060
I fucked it up.

1099
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:11,100
Wait, the demon's already closed, though.

1100
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:15,820
I don't want you telling me I'm ugly when you were looking
like you did before.

1101
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:16,640
Oh, my gosh.

1102
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:21,420
I couldn't find a fucking NPC and I had a bit of an ugly old
man.

1103
00:58:22,740 --> 00:58:24,840
Wait, I'm gonna be like, watch.

What was that?

1109
00:58:31,140 --> 00:58:31,960
I heard a slam.

1110
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:33,460
I got a car.

1111
00:58:33,620 --> 00:58:34,840
Look, look at this car.

1112
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:36,100
Oh, that's so funny.

1113
00:58:36,220 --> 00:58:39,980
Guys, I like how nobody's protecting me while I'm in this
car.

1114
00:58:43,540 --> 00:58:46,540
I like, let me just be in this corner.

1115
00:58:46,780 --> 00:58:47,320
Nobody's in.

1116
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:50,520
Oh, I just, wait, I think I got it.

1117
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:51,820
Wait, is that a demon?

1118
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:52,840
Demon?

1119
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:54,020
Oh, he won!

1122
00:58:55,540 --> 00:58:56,000
That one!

1123
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:57,780
That's her, guys!

1124
00:58:58,400 --> 00:58:59,060
That's her!

1125
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:00,380
I can't see anything!

1126
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:00,760
Yeah!

1127
00:59:01,220 --> 00:59:01,700
That's her!

1128
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:03,720
She's just looking at us!

1129
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:05,220
Be gone!

1130
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:06,800
Oh.

1131
00:59:07,660 --> 00:59:08,620
It's okay, guys.

1132
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:09,380
I got us.

1133
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:10,520
She's gone.

1134
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:11,000
She's gone.

1135
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:11,320
She's gone.

1136
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:11,960
I got us.

1137
00:59:12,580 --> 00:59:12,860
Whoa!

1138
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:14,140
Oh, my bad.

1139
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:16,480
My bad.

1140
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:18,460
Okay, we did a bit of damage.

1141
00:59:19,420 --> 00:59:21,160
Like, I just stood there.

1142
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:23,880
Oh, does that heal you guys?

1143
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:24,900
She was just standing there.

1144
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:26,420
She's like, I don't know what I'm doing.

1145
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:29,660
Oh, that's a shield.

1146
00:59:29,980 --> 00:59:30,620
Okay, we got five.

1147
00:59:30,740 --> 00:59:30,960
Whoa!

1148
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:31,540
Lights!

1149
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:32,160
Lights!

1150
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:33,700
Where the lights are!

1151
00:59:34,060 --> 00:59:35,140
The circuit breakers.

1152
00:59:35,820 --> 00:59:36,360
Okay, okay.

1153
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:37,740
Or the circuit breakers.

1154
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:39,240
Don't worry.

1155
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:42,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1156
00:59:42,180 --> 00:59:43,020
The priest is doing it.

1157
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:45,300
The priest went to electrician school.

1158
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:48,740
Before he became a priest, he went to trade school.

1159
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:51,160
And then he found God.

1160
00:59:52,180 --> 00:59:54,160
He found God after.

1161
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:54,980
Found God.

1162
00:59:56,840 --> 00:59:59,840
I have, like, cameras, but I don't think I'm going to use
the camera.

1163
01:00:01,940 --> 01:00:02,420
Don't worry.

1164
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:04,300
I have no idea what the camera does.

1165
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:05,140
I was trying.

1166
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:06,060
I have no clue.

1167
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:06,660
Don't worry.

1168
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:08,060
I have movement, too.

1169
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:10,000
I don't even think I picked up half of this stuff.

1170
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:10,980
Oh, my God.

1171
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:12,800
Demon gets closer.

1172
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:13,260
Don't worry.

1173
01:00:13,340 --> 01:00:14,000
I have a metal detector.

1174
01:00:14,620 --> 01:00:16,440
Like, can I shoot the innocent people?

1175
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:18,000
Oh, my God.

1176
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:18,620
He's on me.

1177
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:19,880
She's on me.

1178
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:20,480
Oh, my God.

1179
01:00:20,580 --> 01:00:20,740
What the?

1180
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:21,400
Please.

1181
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:23,320
Oh, oh, this is the thing.

1182
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:23,720
Oh my bad.

1183
01:00:23,860 --> 01:00:24,480
Oh my god, please.

1184
01:00:24,820 --> 01:00:26,820
Why is my priest not doing anything?

1185
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:27,500
Why?

1186
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:31,780
What the fuck?

1187
01:00:32,220 --> 01:00:33,820
Oh, there she is.

1188
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:34,200
She's right there.

1189
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:34,740
There she is.

1190
01:00:34,940 --> 01:00:36,300
Oh my god, get her out!

All I can fucking do is turn off the bombs.

01:01:28,690 --> 01:01:30,150

Ow!

1214
01:01:51,150 --> 01:01:51,590
Oh my god.

1215
01:01:51,850 --> 01:01:53,090
Guys, I'm dead.

1216
01:01:53,850 --> 01:01:54,730
Holy shit!

1217
01:01:55,130 --> 01:01:56,430
Oh, okay, here, here, here.

1218
01:01:56,710 --> 01:01:59,110
Okay, guys, let's just find the armored door.

1219
01:01:59,570 --> 01:02:00,330
The priest doesn't have any healing things, right?

1220
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:01,450
No, it's only...

1221
01:02:01,450 --> 01:02:01,890
How do I...

1222
01:02:01,890 --> 01:02:03,850
I think you do, but you have to pick...

1223
01:02:03,850 --> 01:02:04,030
Find it.

01:02:04,390 --> 01:02:05,770
Okay, we gotta like...

1225
01:02:05,770 --> 01:02:06,710
We gotta go to the basement.

1226
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:07,150
Guys.

1227
01:02:07,710 --> 01:02:08,030
Come here.

1228
01:02:08,150 --> 01:02:09,550
Wait, are you actually healing?

1229
01:02:10,710 --> 01:02:11,110
No.

1230
01:02:11,450 --> 01:02:12,070
I don't know.

1231
01:02:12,370 --> 01:02:13,450
Oh, my God.

1232
01:02:13,950 --> 01:02:14,390
Okay.

We gotta find the basement.

01:02:18,330 --> 01:02:19,110
I'm fucking...

1237
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:20,170

1238
01:02:20,270 --> 01:02:21,650
I don't need you guys anymore.

1239
01:02:23,790 --> 01:02:26,390

I can't heal because you're literally capping.

1650
01:21:07,220 --> 01:21:09,240
You're literally getting healed.

1655
01:21:21,740 --> 01:21:22,460

1656
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:32,820
Bro, get off the fucking heels.

01:21:49,320 --> 01:21:50,720

01:22:14,850 --> 01:22:17,920

01:22:28,020 --> 01:22:28,480
No!

1675
01:22:28,920 --> 01:22:30,700

Oh, dink, thanks.

We can wait here.

1681
01:23:08,240 --> 01:23:08,700
Don't worry.

1682
01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:11,240
Wee!

1683
01:23:11,240 --> 01:23:11,820
Wee!

1684
01:23:15,410 --> 01:23:16,130
Duna!

1685
01:23:17,590 --> 01:23:18,110
Hey!

1686
01:23:19,850 --> 01:23:20,450
Help!

1687
01:23:20,930 --> 01:23:21,350
Help!

1688
01:23:23,030 --> 01:23:25,990
And there she goes.

1689
01:23:28,410 --> 01:23:29,390
She's gone.

1690
01:23:30,470 --> 01:23:32,510
She's gone forever.

1691
01:23:38,590 --> 01:23:42,030
Bree's never coming back, guys.

1692
01:23:43,510 --> 01:23:46,750
She's never coming back.

1693
01:23:49,290 --> 01:23:52,670
She's never coming back.

1694
01:23:56,390 --> 01:23:59,030
Holy shit, your feet are looking rough.

1695
01:23:59,730 --> 01:24:01,530
Dude, your toes.

1696
01:24:02,070 --> 01:24:02,650
I'm gonna observe.

1697
01:24:02,670 --> 01:24:06,910
So, yum, yum, yum, she's not coming back for you.

1698
01:24:07,630 --> 01:24:08,450
Yum, yum, yum.

1699
01:24:08,810 --> 01:24:09,550
You can get your nails done.

1700
01:24:09,850 --> 01:24:11,530
I think red would look really good on your toenails.

1701
01:24:11,910 --> 01:24:23,490
I figured out the game.

1702
01:24:26,790 --> 01:24:28,010
Where are you?

1703
01:24:28,710 --> 01:24:29,570
Oh, I should heal.

1704
01:24:30,450 --> 01:24:30,810
Actually.

1705
01:24:31,790 --> 01:24:32,470
What the fuck?

1706
01:24:32,870 --> 01:24:33,770
There's nothing here.

1707
01:24:34,810 --> 01:24:36,470
Oh, it's right here.

1708
01:24:38,530 --> 01:24:40,030
Juna, say something, Juna.

1709
01:24:40,250 --> 01:24:41,410
You're the last one.

1710
01:24:43,170 --> 01:24:43,370
Juna.

1711
01:24:45,730 --> 01:24:46,410
Juna.

1712
01:24:46,970 --> 01:24:48,510
Oh my god, there's so many.

1713
01:24:48,930 --> 01:24:49,970
Open a portal?

1714
01:24:50,790 --> 01:24:51,770
Wait, what's this?

1715
01:24:52,310 --> 01:24:53,250
Turn invisible?

1716
01:24:54,490 --> 01:24:55,790
Let's do it.

1717
01:24:56,410 --> 01:24:57,110
Oh, Juna.

1718
01:24:58,790 --> 01:24:59,470
Juna.

1719
01:24:59,970 --> 01:25:01,390
You're gonna do the silence?

1720
01:25:01,970 --> 01:25:02,990
The silent run?

1721
01:25:04,030 --> 01:25:04,710
Oh.

1722
01:25:04,810 --> 01:25:06,190
No, she's downstairs.

1723
01:25:07,390 --> 01:25:08,630
I hear you, Juna.

1724
01:25:10,010 --> 01:25:11,030
I hear you.

1725
01:25:11,130 --> 01:25:12,930
You're somewhere around.

1726
01:25:15,450 --> 01:25:16,390
Oh, Juna.

1727
01:25:18,010 --> 01:25:19,630
Come on, Juna, say something.

1728
01:25:23,370 --> 01:25:24,430
Juna, keep talking.

1729
01:25:24,850 --> 01:25:26,350
I'm trying to find you.

1730
01:25:28,450 --> 01:25:29,370
Oh, full heal.

1731
01:25:30,930 --> 01:25:32,090
I'm going full heal.

1732
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:37,900
She has to be here somewhere.

1733
01:25:38,540 --> 01:25:38,680
We're going to go.

1734
01:25:38,700 --> 01:25:40,100
Where the fuck did she go?

1735
01:25:40,820 --> 01:25:42,480
What the fuck?

1736
01:25:45,940 --> 01:25:47,700
Where is she?

1737
01:25:50,430 --> 01:25:54,660
Oh my god, she's just trying to one man clutch this.

1738
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:58,620
I'll keep peeling until I'm full HP.

1739
01:25:59,380 --> 01:26:00,560
Until I find her.

1740
01:26:03,380 --> 01:26:04,760
Check every closet?

1741
01:26:04,900 --> 01:26:05,420
Oh, you're right.

1742
01:26:06,100 --> 01:26:07,320
Let's check every closet.

1743
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:11,160
No closet for you.

1744
01:26:13,340 --> 01:26:13,720
What

1745
01:26:17,200 --> 01:26:18,260
the fuck?

1746
01:26:18,460 --> 01:26:19,040
Where am I?

1747
01:26:21,900 --> 01:26:22,660
Hello?

1748
01:26:23,640 --> 01:26:23,840
Hello?

1749
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:25,560

Respect your elders!

1753
01:26:36,030 --> 01:26:37,730
Respect your elders!

1754
01:26:38,750 --> 01:26:39,830
I'm outside now.

1755
01:26:40,570 --> 01:26:41,710
I'm coming for you.

1756
01:26:42,230 --> 01:26:45,250
Oh shit, that's... I can't leave the fuck.

1757
01:26:45,270 --> 01:26:47,550
Fucking, fucking...

1758
01:26:47,550 --> 01:26:49,630
Bannister blocked me.

1759
01:26:50,490 --> 01:26:50,750
Juna?

1760
01:26:51,750 --> 01:26:52,630
Where did you go?

1761
01:26:53,230 --> 01:26:53,570
Juna.

1762
01:26:54,530 --> 01:26:55,750
Juna, you fucking...

1763
01:26:55,750 --> 01:26:57,110
You gotta die eventually!

1764
01:26:57,270 --> 01:26:58,530
Your friends are all dead!

1765
01:27:02,790 --> 01:27:04,530
All your friends are dead!

1766
01:27:04,810 --> 01:27:05,850
Get over here!

1767
01:27:07,050 --> 01:27:08,470
I hear you.

1768
01:27:08,810 --> 01:27:09,470
Get over here!

1769
01:27:10,250 --> 01:27:11,550
All your friends are literally...

1770
01:27:12,150 --> 01:27:13,430
Are you in here?

1771
01:27:14,130 --> 01:27:15,050
Are you in here?

1772
01:27:18,890 --> 01:27:25,770
that's my game right i'm coming for you no you can't that's
a game right get batted

1773
01:27:31,170 --> 01:27:41,710
outside for like 10 minutes you tubing by yourself in the
corner with your little camera i'm sitting inside

1774
01:27:46,150 --> 01:27:48,590
You let your friends die.

1775
01:27:48,750 --> 01:27:50,190
You let Kai die.

1776
01:27:50,750 --> 01:27:52,050
Kai left me to die.

1777
01:27:52,590 --> 01:27:54,710
Kai left me to die so it was only fair.

1778
01:27:54,850 --> 01:27:55,590
Please understand.

1779
01:27:55,710 --> 01:27:56,870
I did it for the end game.

1780
01:27:56,990 --> 01:27:59,030
You did it for your own selfish games.

1781
01:27:59,270 --> 01:28:00,170
Spokers are different.

1782
01:28:00,570 --> 01:28:01,390
But you still die.

1783
01:28:01,670 --> 01:28:03,670
And then two of those went out the building.

1784
01:28:04,490 --> 01:28:05,730
Never came back.

1785
01:28:06,170 --> 01:28:09,050
Did I just look up and I see you two on the fucking roof?

1786
01:28:09,570 --> 01:28:12,950
What is going on?

1787
01:28:15,270 --> 01:28:20,990
The fact that you let me kidnap Bree up on the roof and you
guys couldn't do anything about it.

1788
01:28:20,990 --> 01:28:22,210
Yeah, I was watching.

1789
01:28:22,530 --> 01:28:23,470
You were playing with her body.

1790
01:28:24,450 --> 01:28:29,050
I fell off the other side of the roof and you guys weren't
there to- I was on the ground.

1791
01:28:29,270 --> 01:28:30,730
Yeah, she was like, you guys!

1792
01:28:30,850 --> 01:28:30,970
Help!

1793
01:28:32,650 --> 01:28:34,430
This is just taking pictures.

1794
01:28:34,630 --> 01:28:35,550
She got the camera out.

1795
01:28:36,270 --> 01:28:38,030
You can't have saved her.

1796
01:28:38,130 --> 01:28:41,290
Like, she literally fell off the roof and you just let her
die.

1797
01:28:41,490 --> 01:28:43,110
No, but I thought she was dead already.

1798
01:28:43,430 --> 01:28:43,690
Yeah!

1799
01:28:44,150 --> 01:28:44,590
No!

1800
01:28:45,270 --> 01:28:55,530
I love it every time it sets it so you get 30 seconds every
time I was playing with my food and you still didn't save

1801
01:28:55,530 --> 01:29:09,850
her that's so fucked up I'm honestly like so surprised we
lasted so long that first game now like the first 20 minutes

1802
01:29:09,850 --> 01:29:18,410
is like how do I attack because I could just only crawl and
then it pulled me the button.

1803
01:29:18,590 --> 01:29:20,090
We just crawling around.

1804
01:29:20,550 --> 01:29:22,090
That's like, what's Juno?

1805
01:29:22,410 --> 01:29:23,390
I was so confused.

1806
01:29:23,670 --> 01:29:24,190
It's okay.

1807
01:29:25,130 --> 01:29:25,690
It's good.

1808
01:29:25,910 --> 01:29:30,090
No, Juno, you purposely let us go through all the objectives
to see what it was like, right?

1809
01:29:30,770 --> 01:29:31,350
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1810
01:29:31,650 --> 01:29:32,290
Of course, of course.

1811
01:29:33,250 --> 01:29:33,490
Trust.

1812
01:29:33,670 --> 01:29:34,310
Oh, so generous.

1813
01:29:34,630 --> 01:29:35,530
Yeah, that's so generous.

1814
01:29:35,750 --> 01:29:36,730
I can't believe that.

1815
01:29:36,890 --> 01:29:38,110
You guys bullied the elderly, though.

1816
01:29:38,210 --> 01:29:39,090
That's so fucked up.

1817
01:29:39,270 --> 01:29:40,170
For my Spanish.

1818
01:29:40,430 --> 01:29:41,650
That elderly killed me.

1819
01:29:41,770 --> 01:29:44,890
That elderly dressed into the roof and then made fun of me.

1820
01:29:45,270 --> 01:29:55,410
Only did that because you three ganged up on the sweet old
lady Yeah You guys surrounded me It was self-defense It was

We did it!

2142
01:41:44,860 --> 01:41:46,340
That's fucking right.

2143
01:41:48,300 --> 01:41:49,940
You don't like my dark side?

2144
01:41:49,940 --> 01:41:51,460
You don't like my dark side?

2145
01:41:51,940 --> 01:41:53,040
What the fuck?

2146
01:41:55,900 --> 01:41:56,500
Okay.

2147
01:41:57,200 --> 01:42:00,320
Well, we know who's the worst demon out there.

2148
01:42:00,340 --> 01:42:00,840
I know.

2149
01:42:03,720 --> 01:42:07,380
We know who's the worst one out there.

2150
01:42:07,880 --> 01:42:08,480
We know who's the worst one out there.

2151
01:42:08,480 --> 01:42:10,300
I'm trying to figure out what the thing is.

2152
01:42:11,380 --> 01:42:12,900
See what's hard coming.

2153
01:42:13,040 --> 01:42:13,760
It is.

2154
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:15,120
It is hard.

2155
01:42:15,780 --> 01:42:16,160
All right.

2156
01:42:16,300 --> 01:42:17,660
I won't shit on you again.

2157
01:42:19,020 --> 01:42:20,080
I'm sorry.

2158
01:42:21,080 --> 01:42:21,780
I'm sorry.

something lg lg would tune us a demon okay okay you got this

2160
01:42:28,220 --> 01:42:35,500

asylum because like we haven't actually do the dokey dokey

2163
01:42:50,520 --> 01:42:52,260
was the easiest for June.

2164
01:42:54,380 --> 01:42:57,220
I think the one that I was in was fairly easy.

2165
01:42:57,540 --> 01:42:57,800
Yeah, yeah.

2166
01:42:57,900 --> 01:42:58,600
Oh, the hotel.

2167
01:42:58,840 --> 01:42:59,260
Yeah, yeah.

2168
01:42:59,780 --> 01:43:04,920
If it wasn't, and it becomes hard, that just makes my ego
better, though, because that means that I did well on it.

2169
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:11,200
Okay, I'll do my best, because I believe in you.

2170
01:43:13,720 --> 01:43:14,120
Okay.

01:43:14,420 --> 01:43:15,320
Yeah, I'm going to kill you.

2172
01:43:15,340 --> 01:43:15,600

All right, I'm the engineer again.

2175
01:43:18,720 --> 01:43:21,180
Maybe I can actually figure out how to play this time.

2176
01:43:21,420 --> 01:43:23,180
All right, muting.

All right, we see that.

2206
01:45:02,880 --> 01:45:04,820
I don't think we need armor, right?

2207
01:45:04,880 --> 01:45:06,020
What does that magnetic detector do?

2208
01:45:06,360 --> 01:45:07,720
It senses a demon.

2209
01:45:08,340 --> 01:45:08,500
Wait.

2210
01:45:09,440 --> 01:45:09,680
Yeah.

2211
01:45:09,800 --> 01:45:11,820
Oh, that's her, that's her, that's her!

2212
01:45:12,100 --> 01:45:12,360
That's her!

2213
01:45:12,400 --> 01:45:13,460
That's why she jumped!

2214
01:45:14,220 --> 01:45:15,200
NPCs can't jump!

2215
01:45:15,320 --> 01:45:16,260
I figured it out!

2216
01:45:16,940 --> 01:45:17,860
NPCs don't jump!

2217
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:19,180
That's automatically her!

2218
01:45:19,360 --> 01:45:19,420
Oh, my God!

2219
01:45:19,620 --> 01:45:20,220
You funny!

2220
01:45:22,180 --> 01:45:25,240
Oh, no, she's actually, she can navigate.

2221
01:45:25,580 --> 01:45:26,900
Oh, no, she is.

2222
01:45:26,940 --> 01:45:28,060
She knows how to crawl.

2223
01:45:28,280 --> 01:45:30,160
No, she knows how to crawl.

2224
01:45:31,140 --> 01:45:32,400
What a freak.

2225
01:45:33,960 --> 01:45:36,140
Oh, literally a fucking freak.

2226
01:45:36,880 --> 01:45:37,940
A fucking freak.

2227
01:45:38,540 --> 01:45:41,260
This is why you got bullied and became a demon.

2228
01:45:43,740 --> 01:45:45,020
Okay, we need to...

2229
01:45:45,020 --> 01:45:45,620
Why you got bullied?

2230
01:45:45,980 --> 01:45:47,900
We need to find the...

2231
01:45:47,900 --> 01:45:49,420
We need to find one more candle.

2232
01:45:50,540 --> 01:45:51,120
Ooh, dokey.

2233
01:45:51,420 --> 01:45:53,900
I can actually do my task.

2234
01:45:53,940 --> 01:45:54,480
Oh my god.

2235
01:45:54,920 --> 01:45:56,360
Oh my god.

2236
01:45:56,620 --> 01:45:57,180
It's huge.

2237
01:45:58,900 --> 01:46:00,440
She's finally learned.

2238
01:46:01,260 --> 01:46:02,460
We need to find another candle.

2239
01:46:02,700 --> 01:46:03,820
We're literally missing one candle.

2240
01:46:07,900 --> 01:46:08,240
Oh, no.

2241
01:46:08,280 --> 01:46:08,920
That's bandage.

2242
01:46:09,040 --> 01:46:09,720
Where the fuck?

2243
01:46:11,500 --> 01:46:12,620
How much is, though?

2244
01:46:14,520 --> 01:46:16,700
We're literally missing one candle.

2245
01:46:17,580 --> 01:46:18,340
Oh no, guys.

2246
01:46:18,420 --> 01:46:19,800
I split up with a gang.

2247
01:46:20,380 --> 01:46:21,320
This is not good.

2248
01:46:22,980 --> 01:46:24,660
important for the candle, though.

2249
01:46:24,980 --> 01:46:26,120
Would there be candles upstairs?

2250
01:46:26,840 --> 01:46:28,060
Would there be candles upstairs?

2251
01:46:28,720 --> 01:46:28,960
Right?

2252
01:46:29,600 --> 01:46:31,860
Collect blood from crying statues?

2253
01:46:33,280 --> 01:46:35,340
Maybe there'd be candles upstairs.

2254
01:46:36,480 --> 01:46:37,280
Wait, do we do it?

2255
01:46:38,400 --> 01:46:39,020
Am I stuck?

2256
01:46:39,740 --> 01:46:40,180
Guys!

2257
01:46:40,680 --> 01:46:40,920
Oh.

2258
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:43,640
What?

2259
01:46:43,880 --> 01:46:45,500
Oh, I was in the table.

2260
01:46:46,080 --> 01:46:48,240
I was like, what the fuck?

2261
01:46:48,820 --> 01:46:51,100
Guys, are you found the last candle yet?

2262
01:46:51,760 --> 01:46:52,400
Why

2263
01:46:59,140 --> 01:46:59,700
is he her?

2264
01:46:59,720 --> 01:47:01,820
What the...

2265
01:47:01,820 --> 01:47:03,280
Is that...

2266
01:47:03,280 --> 01:47:04,040
Was that you?

2267
01:47:12,900 --> 01:47:14,640
Did you guys... We did it!

2268
01:47:14,740 --> 01:47:15,320
We did it!

2269
01:47:19,480 --> 01:47:20,280
It's me.

2270
01:47:21,040 --> 01:47:21,740
Yeah, it's me.

2271
01:47:21,820 --> 01:47:22,920
I found, like, an enchanted...

2272
01:47:23,480 --> 01:47:24,680
One of the fucking...

2273
01:47:24,680 --> 01:47:25,360
Or minions.

2274
01:47:28,620 --> 01:47:30,540
We need to find... Collect blood from Christ.

2275
01:47:30,660 --> 01:47:32,200
Is that the statues outside?

2276
01:47:33,840 --> 01:47:35,280
Oh, I'm lost.

2277
01:47:36,280 --> 01:47:39,700
Guys, what do crying statues look like?

2278
01:47:40,980 --> 01:47:41,420
Guys?

2279
01:47:43,280 --> 01:47:44,980
Oh, it must be outside, right?

2280
01:47:57,700 --> 01:48:04,400
Guys, I found her.

2281
01:48:05,040 --> 01:48:06,560
I found the statues.

2282
01:48:06,780 --> 01:48:07,080
I'm out.

2283
01:48:07,140 --> 01:48:07,880
That's outside.

2284
01:48:09,360 --> 01:48:10,240
Oh, okay.

2285
01:48:10,320 --> 01:48:11,280
It's outside.

2286
01:48:11,860 --> 01:48:12,380
Get away!

2287
01:48:12,640 --> 01:48:14,000
Get away from us!

2288
01:48:14,100 --> 01:48:15,760
You're not wanted, Juna!

2289
01:48:16,620 --> 01:48:17,500
Get away!

2290
01:48:17,780 --> 01:48:18,600
Don't buggy!

2291
01:48:18,740 --> 01:48:19,500
You can't tell me what to do!

2292
01:48:19,720 --> 01:48:21,200
Nobody thinks you're cool!

2293
01:48:21,420 --> 01:48:21,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2294
01:48:21,860 --> 01:48:23,900
You can try, but you can't- We did it!

2295
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:24,660
Place the candles.

2296
01:48:24,860 --> 01:48:25,780
Oh, where's the circle?

2297
01:48:25,940 --> 01:48:26,440
No, no, I'm good.

2298
01:48:26,660 --> 01:48:26,800
I'm good.

2299
01:48:26,800 --> 01:48:28,060
I think we did it!

2300
01:48:28,180 --> 01:48:30,040
Place the candles in a circle and like them.

2301
01:48:30,180 --> 01:48:31,500
Where the fuck is that?

2302
01:48:31,800 --> 01:48:32,440
And where?

2303
01:48:32,620 --> 01:48:33,440
Yeah, where?

2304
01:48:34,040 --> 01:48:35,840
Oh, good reason not to fucking shoot you right now, Juna.

2305
01:48:37,340 --> 01:48:38,280
Don't wait, watch this.

2306
01:48:38,440 --> 01:48:40,760
That's fucking right, you did...

2307
01:48:47,520 --> 01:48:48,280
No!

2308
01:48:53,140 --> 01:48:54,140
She's a demon!

2309
01:48:54,460 --> 01:48:56,420
Demons don't deserve love!

2310
01:48:57,140 --> 01:48:58,360
She's so sweet!

2311
01:48:58,720 --> 01:48:59,380
She's so sad!

2312
01:48:59,440 --> 01:49:01,440
She's just manipulating you!

2313
01:49:01,660 --> 01:49:03,020
She's just acting!

2314
01:49:03,600 --> 01:49:04,980
It's just acting!

2315
01:49:06,820 --> 01:49:08,420
It's just acting!

01:49:09,160 --> 01:49:16,200

We got find the circle.

2318
01:49:17,900 --> 01:49:18,840

We gotta figure out the lights.

2331
01:50:35,980 --> 01:50:38,980
Oh Oh, there's a circuit breaker right here Oh, nice.

2332

I just keep fixing.

2334
01:50:43,360 --> 01:50:45,000
When you have five sets of electric...

2335
01:50:46,740 --> 01:50:49,040
Yeah, you literally got a degree for this.

2336
01:50:49,060 --> 01:50:49,980

I am finally a proper medic.

2341
01:50:55,300 --> 01:50:58,000
It took her 20 years to get her medical degree.

2342
01:50:58,620 --> 01:51:00,640
We have fine electric cables.

2343
01:51:00,900 --> 01:51:01,820
Where would that be?

2344
01:51:02,560 --> 01:51:04,300
I've never seen what it looked like, either.

2345
01:51:04,780 --> 01:51:05,660
Maybe out six.

2346
01:51:05,820 --> 01:51:07,920
Oh, oh, oh, oh, we found the generator.

2347
01:51:08,700 --> 01:51:10,440
Yeah, yeah, but...

2348
01:51:11,400 --> 01:51:13,360

Oh, that's a window.

2351
01:51:18,120 --> 01:51:19,280
Oh, we found two generators.

2352
01:51:19,420 --> 01:51:21,200
What would the electric cable look like?

2353
01:51:22,260 --> 01:51:22,520
Yep.

2354
01:51:23,620 --> 01:51:25,220
But what would the cables look like?

2355
01:51:25,780 --> 01:51:26,260
Yeah.

2356
01:51:26,500 --> 01:51:27,140
I don't know.

2357
01:51:28,200 --> 01:51:29,140
I've got the generators.

2358
01:51:29,420 --> 01:51:30,300
I've got more matches.

2359
01:51:30,440 --> 01:51:31,700
I'm right here behind you.

2360
01:51:32,240 --> 01:51:32,580
Juna!

2361
01:51:33,740 --> 01:51:35,600
Juna, where are you, Juna?

2362
01:51:37,120 --> 01:51:40,740
Juna, you're not beating the allegations about you and your
skills and more.

2363
01:51:40,760 --> 01:51:41,500
Monsters.

2364
01:51:42,220 --> 01:51:43,280
I don't like this.

2365
01:51:43,560 --> 01:51:44,300
I don't like this.

2366
01:51:44,580 --> 01:51:45,160
Oh, that's you.

2367
01:51:47,420 --> 01:51:49,040
That was on reflex.

2368
01:51:53,120 --> 01:51:53,860
Where the fuck?

2369
01:51:54,900 --> 01:51:56,600
Where is the electric cable?

2370
01:51:57,820 --> 01:51:58,920
I don't know what they look like.

2371
01:51:59,060 --> 01:51:59,980
I don't know either.

2372
01:52:00,580 --> 01:52:01,860
Oh, this has to be something.

2373
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:03,440
Oh, we put a generator here.

2374
01:52:03,600 --> 01:52:04,360
That's our goal.

2375
01:52:04,640 --> 01:52:04,960
Yeah.

2376
01:52:05,180 --> 01:52:06,480
We have to go here.

2377
01:52:08,740 --> 01:52:09,620
Maybe downstairs.

2378
01:52:09,840 --> 01:52:10,740
Maybe go back in basement.

2379
01:52:10,760 --> 01:52:11,640
Maybe.

2380
01:52:12,820 --> 01:52:14,760
Where the fuck did Juna go?

Juna, back!

2383
01:52:19,900 --> 01:52:22,400
I like how everybody always possessed the elderly.

2384
01:52:24,140 --> 01:52:24,920
Juna, we know...

2385
01:52:24,920 --> 01:52:25,620
No, she's back.

2386
01:52:25,800 --> 01:52:26,700
Oh, no, she's right.

2387
01:52:26,800 --> 01:52:27,840
She's literally right here.

2388
01:52:28,980 --> 01:52:30,420
Juna, get back in, Juna!

2389
01:52:31,200 --> 01:52:31,460
Juna!

It's just on the floor.

2399
01:52:56,960 --> 01:52:58,400
It's just like wires on the floor.

2400

01:59:10,940 --> 01:59:11,880
How the fuck?

2496
01:59:12,220 --> 01:59:13,240
What did you guys do?

2497
01:59:13,400 --> 01:59:14,560
I was doing a puzzle.

2498
01:59:15,340 --> 01:59:17,100
Juna, you're too good at this.

2499
01:59:17,180 --> 01:59:18,720
I was doing a puzzle.

2500
01:59:19,160 --> 01:59:19,740
What happened?

2501
01:59:21,040 --> 01:59:22,560
We were doing a puzzle.

2502
01:59:22,840 --> 01:59:28,080
just saw you and then we both went down and I turned back to
ask for help and you just disappeared.

2503
01:59:29,780 --> 01:59:31,300
I thought you were okay.

2504
01:59:31,740 --> 01:59:33,260
I was trying to turn to.

2505
01:59:34,360 --> 01:59:35,880
I was like, oh, that'll be fine.

2506
01:59:35,980 --> 01:59:39,820
I'm going to do this puzzle and then no, we were.

2507
01:59:42,140 --> 01:59:43,580
You were not fine.

2508
01:59:43,900 --> 01:59:44,460
Did I do good?

2509
01:59:44,460 --> 01:59:47,940
I was a little bad in the beginning, but yeah, you're a
natural.

2510
01:59:48,100 --> 01:59:48,540
It makes sense.

2511
01:59:49,220 --> 01:59:49,660
Redemption arc.

2512
01:59:49,800 --> 01:59:50,400
It makes sense.

2513
01:59:50,640 --> 01:59:52,100
Juna redemption arc right there.

2514
01:59:52,840 --> 01:59:54,220
minutes to 14.

2515
01:59:54,520 --> 01:59:55,840
That was so good.

2516
01:59:56,720 --> 01:59:59,160
The evil laughing throughout really sweet.

2517
01:59:59,620 --> 02:00:00,040
You know, right?

2518
02:00:00,840 --> 02:00:03,020
I just hear her fucking devilish laughing.

2519
02:00:07,900 --> 02:00:09,800
That was like, that was great.

2520
02:00:10,140 --> 02:00:11,600
I turned around, I was like, we do this.

2521
02:00:14,080 --> 02:00:14,660
I know.

2522
02:00:15,760 --> 02:00:16,540
Holy shit.

2523
02:00:16,560 --> 02:00:18,900
But you didn't mean to, like, purposely leave them, though,
right?

2524
02:00:18,940 --> 02:00:20,080
No, I was like, oh, it'll be fine.

2525
02:00:20,220 --> 02:00:22,740
I'm gonna do the fucking punch.

2526
02:00:22,840 --> 02:00:24,460
Yeah, your purposefully left us.

2527
02:00:24,480 --> 02:00:26,060
So your purposefully left us.

2528
02:00:26,300 --> 02:00:27,400
They'll be fine.

2529
02:00:27,500 --> 02:00:28,760
They'll be fine.

2530
02:00:29,200 --> 02:00:30,360
I'm gonna do the puzzle.

2531
02:00:30,560 --> 02:00:32,380
They're gonna protect me from the puzzle.

2532
02:00:32,840 --> 02:00:33,060
No.

2533
02:00:33,800 --> 02:00:34,320
No.

2534
02:00:35,620 --> 02:00:36,740
And I was like, I'm sorry.

2535
02:00:37,020 --> 02:00:37,280
I learned.

2536
02:00:37,660 --> 02:00:39,160
I learned things on my shoes.

2537
02:00:40,120 --> 02:00:41,860
I'm sorry, you relied on the wrong people.

2538
02:00:42,200 --> 02:00:42,800
I'm sorry.

2539
02:00:44,820 --> 02:00:47,200
I realized that was a mistake.

2540
02:00:48,360 --> 02:00:52,560
I was the medic and I was always the first one going into a
shooter.

2541
02:00:52,840 --> 02:01:04,340
had one gun and it was a little serene but i wasn't ready
man i was like oh maybe maybe i shouldn't have left oh yeah

2542
02:01:04,340 --> 02:01:17,860
you think i'm so glad that crossed your mind yeah that was
the deal definitely definitely shouldn't have left it's okay

2543
02:01:17,860 --> 02:01:25,540
it's okay that was fun yeah that was awesome that was This
is why we had to go in blind without the tutorial.

2544
02:01:26,140 --> 02:01:27,080
It's better!

2545
02:01:27,580 --> 02:01:34,840
It's better because the demon is so overpowered when you
figure out how to actually play the demon.

2546
02:01:37,060 --> 02:01:43,380
I loved when I played and the first thing I heard was, oh my
god, she knows how to play the game.

2547
02:01:43,620 --> 02:01:44,360
Oh my god!

2548
02:01:48,480 --> 02:01:52,140
I was like, oh no, we're not gonna have a good time.

2549
02:01:52,140 --> 02:02:01,680
she knows how to play it's okay but i i guess i actually
have nothing else to say the demons we made along the way we

2550
02:02:01,680 --> 02:02:11,120
killed along the way we killed along the way there we go
appreciation for elderly women oh my god children are the

2551
02:02:11,120 --> 02:02:15,240
elderly who would have thought i feel like i just did
something unethical i gotta go to the nursing home bring

2552
02:02:15,240 --> 02:02:22,120
them cupcakes for some community service now i don't know i
feel like normally obligated right now they deserve it

2553
02:02:22,140 --> 02:02:32,300
things they're touching you'll never know the next elderly
could be the next demon you'll never know remember to your

2554
02:02:32,300 --> 02:02:38,760
elders right or else they might kill you yeah exactly this
is why we put them in homes because we're worried about them

2555
02:02:38,760 --> 02:02:45,740
turning into demons they turn into demons they'll just turn
into demons between each other retirement homes are actually

2556
02:02:45,740 --> 02:02:53,420
like homes for churches yeah oh my god That was so fun.

2557
02:02:53,440 --> 02:02:55,920
You're a boy, a boy, a boy.

2558
02:02:55,920 --> 02:02:56,200
A boy, a boy.

2559
02:02:56,200 --> 02:02:58,600
We all be safe.

2560
02:02:59,660 --> 02:03:03,840
Yeah, wait, do any of you guys have announcements for like
the coming week?

2561
02:03:04,320 --> 02:03:05,720
It's just a collab.

2562
02:03:06,560 --> 02:03:06,640
It's a collab.

2563
02:03:07,380 --> 02:03:11,480
I mean like, I'm supposed to, it's like I normally just ask
and then you're like, wow, that's so cool.

2564
02:03:11,600 --> 02:03:12,240
You're so slow.

2565
02:03:13,980 --> 02:03:16,000

2570
02:03:21,520 --> 02:03:22,000
Why?

2571
02:03:22,140 --> 02:03:32,580
humor has to be a genius right nobody's nice for no reason

every time that's exactly how i sound like oh my god

2574
02:03:57,350 --> 02:04:11,730
weird roleplay session I think I walked into some roleplay
shit here at the moment It's like a VR chat where you join a

2575
02:04:11,730 --> 02:04:14,650
random world and then there's two these two people

2576
02:04:18,270 --> 02:04:23,410
It's okay, Juno, she doesn't understand us Yeah, I should
understand our bond, our relationship

2577
02:04:26,550 --> 02:04:30,190
Nooo like it, you know, like doing it in public, like this
PDA.

2578
02:04:30,610 --> 02:04:33,150
Yeah, this is a part of it.

2579
02:04:33,410 --> 02:04:34,470
This is part of it.

2580
02:04:35,630 --> 02:04:37,990
But you're part of it to do it in public?

2581
02:04:38,270 --> 02:04:39,750
And so, like, people would watch this.

2582
02:04:40,590 --> 02:04:42,570
That's when our everything's out.

2583
02:04:42,730 --> 02:04:43,970
We're still covered, bro.

2584
02:04:44,850 --> 02:04:47,330
So now, we're still covered.

2585
02:04:48,170 --> 02:04:50,990
We have, like, we have space for Jesus, too.

2586
02:04:53,870 --> 02:04:55,110
Also the baby.

2587
02:04:56,730 --> 02:04:58,270
Jesus, are you the baby?

2588
02:04:58,810 --> 02:04:59,870
Is this an exhibition?

2589
02:05:00,270 --> 02:05:03,910
Yes, this is a- Is this- Is this a- Is this a- Is this an
exhibition?

2590
02:05:04,150 --> 02:05:05,910
Because there's no private parts, no key.

2591
02:05:06,150 --> 02:05:06,550
Oh my god.

2592
02:05:08,590 --> 02:05:10,010
We're still alone.

2593
02:05:16,950 --> 02:05:19,710
Now we know who's definitely going to hell.

2594
02:05:23,330 --> 02:05:25,210
She learned something from the demons.

2595
02:05:26,930 --> 02:05:27,630

02:08:53,470 --> 02:08:57,250
Bree literally sounds like Webby from DuckTales.

2660
02:08:58,810 --> 02:09:08,950
remember i was like oh my gosh this is like one to one
exactly her voice i was like holy shit that's literally her

2661
02:09:08,950 --> 02:09:15,570
like how like people are like oh my god dokie you sound like
that fucking girl in gravity falls even though i don't think

2662
02:09:15,570 --> 02:09:21,810
so i don't think i sound like i think like i would sometimes
hit the intonations of her but like i don't think i i

2663
02:09:21,810 --> 02:09:27,850
personally don't think i actually sound like her like what's
her name i keep forgetting but like the girl who that main

2664
02:09:27,850 --> 02:09:34,350
character Sometimes, apparently sometimes, I can sound like
Mabel when I talk, but I don't, I don't hear it.

2665
02:09:34,650 --> 02:09:37,950
But I think if I go higher, I think if I go a higher pitch,
I sound like Mabel.

2666
02:09:38,810 --> 02:09:41,090
Um, yeah.

2667
02:09:41,510 --> 02:09:47,170
So, but I swear, Brie sounds exactly like Webby from Death
Tales.

2668
02:09:47,710 --> 02:09:55,250
And she sounds like, like, because like, uh, the actress
does, like, so many voice acting for, like, different, uh,

2669
02:09:55,250 --> 02:09:56,250
uh, Vellma!

2670
02:09:56,970 --> 02:09:58,770
It's like a mix between Vellma.

2671
02:09:58,810 --> 02:10:10,350
and webby it sounds just like it sounds like almost like
velma and webby if you think about it like if you just
