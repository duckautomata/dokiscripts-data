1
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,200
Hello, hello everybody!

2
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:57,940
I just realized I didn't open my chat, give me a- I was like, something looks a little different.

3
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,080
I was like, oh wait, I don't even have chat open.

4
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,900
Oh my god, I still like this.

5
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:11,020
Oh, thank you for the 10 gifted shows, thank you, thank you!

6
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:14,720
I'm just booting up my chat right now.

7
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:15,380
I...

8
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,620
I don't know why I'm like this, guys.

9
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,860
Why am I like this?

10
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:25,580
Alright, there we go.

11
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,340
Don't worry, you guys are alive now.

12
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:31,440
I got you guys.

13
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,300
Alright, today is a big Overwatch 2 update!

14
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:37,640
Juno!

15
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:40,460
I can finally try out Juno for the first time!

16
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:45,360
We were not able to play Juno before because I didn't realize Juno was there.

17
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:50,140
Juno was like limit- Juno playtest ended so early.

18
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:55,940
Because usually, usually, you know, I didn't realize it was like a sneak peek thing.

19
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,880
So her abilities are very interesting.

20
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:04,940
So she has this thing which makes you shoot faster and stuff.

21
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,200
So you can shoot faster when you're in it and stuff.

22
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,880
And then we have the fly.

23
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,960
So we can float and stuff like Echo.

24
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,180
And then we have this.

25
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:16,520
Which is pretty interesting.

26
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,280
It locks onto enemies as well.

27
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:21,020
You can walk around too with that.

28
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,260
But oops, I sort of didn't use that correctly.

29
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,600
It's timed.

30
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:29,080
It's not in rank so like we can't test this out in rank.

31
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:34,300
But basically what this does is that it locks into people and then it locks into enemies.

32
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,500
Fuck, I cancelled it again.

33
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:41,460
You have to right- left click afterwards and I'm so not used to that.

34
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,920
Sorry, I cancelled it again.

35
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,520
Okay, now!

36
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:47,980
And then you see that.

37
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,140
So it damages people and it can heal at the same time.

38
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,540
The cooldowns are not that bad.

39
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:58,860
But I feel like they're just gonna nerf that when she's in rank usually.

40
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,120
And then her ult.

41
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,640
Her ult, she does everything fast.

42
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:14,500
Her ult is basically her abilities but like bigger and lasting longer I assume.

43
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,100
But it just makes her fast as well.

44
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:20,140
So yeah, she's pretty interesting.

45
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,460
Her damage is not that...

46
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,020
It's not great.

47
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:27,860
Her heal output seems fine.

48
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:32,360
Her heal output seems to be similar to Ana with like one shot.

49
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,880
But instead it's multiple shots.

50
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,400
But DPS healers are always great.

51
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,820
It's great to have DPS healers.

52
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,880
Actually, yeah, it's always great.

53
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:47,000
DPS healers are always considered like pretty meta.

54
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:47,980
So like...

55
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:49,460
I don't know.

56
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:50,760
She could be good.

57
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:51,780
She could be good.

58
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,580
I can't tell yet.

59
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:53,940
I can't tell.

60
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:58,040
It's been a while since I follow like Overwatch meta.

61
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,760
But she seems pretty decent.

62
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,820
She seems very fun to play.

63
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,080
And like that's what Overwatch needs.

64
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,440
Like something fun to play.

65
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,180
Because like...

66
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:13,240
There hasn't been like lots of fun characters lately.

67
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,260
So...

68
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,180
They also...

69
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,700
They just need fun characters.

70
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,680
Yeah, she can't crit.

71
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,580
So it's mostly like...

72
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:24,080
Mostly if I had to pick between Ilari or Juno.

73
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,760
I feel like if I'm here to do damage, I'd pick...

74
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,180
I'd pick Ilari over Juno.

75
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,620
But then Juno has like the Lucio speed boost thing.

76
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:35,520
Which is this.

77
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,820
So you can't control where it goes.

78
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,900
So assume like when you're facing...

79
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:43,220
What you're facing is where it's gonna go.

80
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:45,800
So it's just a speed boost.

81
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,920
The GR66, they're thinking about it.

82
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,040
They're not actually implementing it yet.

83
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,260
It's more so...

84
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:56,660
I feel like they say that just to gauge audience's reactions.

85
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,160
Just see what people would think.

86
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,300
It's not a speed boost.

87
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,620
Oh, it's a damage amp?

88
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,300
Oh, okay.

89
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:04,660
Alright.

90
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,680
It feels...

91
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,760
I feel faster.

92
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,760
Maybe it's because like her gun is so fast.

93
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:11,400
So, okay.

94
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:12,760
It's basically...

95
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,600
A damage boost.

96
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:15,700
Oh, okay.

97
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,520
That's interesting.

98
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,420
It's a very offensive ult.

99
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,860
And then I heard there's two new maps.

100
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,840
There's like...

101
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,440
They brought...

102
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,840
They basically brought back Hanamura and Anubis.

103
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,380
But like not 2CP.

104
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,220
Which fucking sucks.

105
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,140
Because I'm like...

106
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,900
I actually like 2CP.

107
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:36,680
The clash game mode sounds terrible.

108
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:37,140
I don't know.

109
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,460
Maybe it's not bad.

110
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:39,440
I'll try...

111
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,520
I'll look it out.

112
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:41,280
I'll check it out.

113
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:41,540
Okay.

114
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:41,980
Let's see.

115
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,640
Custom games.

116
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:44,260
Is it out now?

117
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,540
Clash is out, right?

118
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,000
Yeah.

119
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,120
It's like 5CP.

120
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,540
I'm Chuno.

121
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:49,520
For Juno.

122
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:50,800
Alright.

123
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,960
Let's see if it is out.

124
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:52,540
Yeah.

125
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:52,880
It is.

126
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:53,600
Clash is out.

127
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:54,200
God damn.

128
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:54,480
Okay.

129
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:55,100
Alright.

130
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,100
So, Clash.

131
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,180
I don't really understand what Clash is.

132
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:58,800
To be fair.

133
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,840
I read it.

134
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:01,480
And it like...

135
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:01,960
It was...

136
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,080
It looked so confusing.

137
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:03,720
I'm...

138
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,880
I'm gonna straight up say it.

139
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,440
Like, I was so confused.

140
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,220
I was like...

141
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,800
I was reading it.

142
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,080
I was like...

143
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,380
The fuck does that mean?

144
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:15,860
I...

145
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,300
I was like...

146
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:18,960
I was like...

147
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,300
There's so many points.

148
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,140
I was like...

149
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,420
And then one of my friends was trying to explain Clash to me.

150
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:24,300
I'm like...

151
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,240
I still don't understand.

152
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:25,700
Okay.

153
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:26,120
So...

154
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,600
Hanaka is basically Hanamura.

155
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,740
So, we will explore...

156
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:31,800
We will explore...

157
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,840
I mean...

158
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,660
It literally is Hanamura.

159
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:37,920
It literally looks like Hanamura.

160
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:38,940
So, we will explore...

161
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:41,020
Yeah.

162
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:41,920
Okay.

163
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,600
Toggle war with maps.

164
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:44,660
That sounds...

165
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:45,200
Oh, God.

166
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,700
I fucking hate...

167
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:47,580
I fucking hate push.

168
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,500
This sounds like push.

169
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:51,360
All right.

170
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,060
Oh.

171
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,500
Oh, there's three openings?

172
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,040
Oh, my God.

173
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:56,880
They can count to three.

174
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:57,560
Okay.

175
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:58,620
So...

176
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,040
What?

177
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:01,260
Okay.

178
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,560
So, that's one of the points, I assume.

179
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:04,580
Oh, my God.

180
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,160
Oh, this is...

181
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,720
Oh, I'm sorry.

182
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:08,200
But...

183
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:08,940
Oh.

184
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:09,560
Oh, my God.

185
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:09,780
Oh, my God.

186
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:14,860
And apparently, if you capture the last...

187
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:18,460
If you can capture the last point, you automatically win.

188
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:19,760
So...

189
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:24,100
So if you capture the last point...

190
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:24,660
Where am I?

191
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:30,900
Where's the last point?

192
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,720
I won't know.

193
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,660
I won't know.

194
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,820
So if you capture point E, you automatically win.

195
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,760
Or if they capture point A...

196
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,360
Then they automatically win.

197
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:47,220
So, but that's like so... you either have to capture all the points or A or E.

198
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:51,580
And I guess like... but I wonder if there's... there has to be a time limit.

199
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,240
There's no way.

200
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:58,380
Yeah, there's too much move... yeah, that's why when I read it, I was like, oh, that's moving...

201
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:01,260
That's just so much for rank, you know?

202
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,220
It's a lot.

203
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:06,760
It's definitely gonna be like super chaotic and stuff.

204
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,960
All points are first to five.

205
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:13,060
Oh god, that's... that's a long game.

206
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:21,640
That sounds... that sounds like... that sounds like a very long game.

207
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:24,240
It sounds like a very stressful game.

208
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,680
Because you have to defend everything!

209
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,920
You have to defend so many places.

210
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,700
Alright, we're gonna see how that's like.

211
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:37,340
Oh my god, I'm... I'm getting too old for this.

212
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,420
I'm just like, oh my god, that's too many points to figure out.

213
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:46,880
Yeah...

214
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:49,220
Okay...

215
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:54,560
As an Overwatch veteran, my mind is already, like, overwhelmed.

216
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,380
I'm now... it's like, hey, let's get rid of two CP.

217
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,420
Let's get rid of two CP and add five CP.

218
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,100
That's what people want.

219
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:04,900
Whoa!

220
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:05,900
Alright.

221
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,720
I mean...

222
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,540
There's really not much to show for Hanamura.

223
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,620
Um, because it's like...

224
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:16,200
It's literally Hanamura plus the...

225
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,800
This literally looks like...

226
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,660
Oh hey, Dog Cafe.

227
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:22,220
This literally looks like Hanamura plus the...

228
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:22,940
Uh...

229
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:23,980
Plus the...

230
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:24,880
Uh...

231
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,540
What was it called?

232
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,100
What's the other map?

233
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,080
For...

234
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:29,380
Um...

235
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:30,240
Deathmatch?

236
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,740
This looks like Deathmatch...

237
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:34,420
The Deathmap match plus Hanamura at the same time.

238
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:35,700
Um...

239
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:36,620
So...

240
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:37,880
Yeah, like, so...

241
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,320
I don't...

242
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,460
I don't feel like...

243
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:39,620
Whoa!

244
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,760
Because it literally looks like that.

245
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,820
It doesn't look much different.

246
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:48,740
Um...

247
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:50,140
It has, like, all the...

248
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,340
Like, this is from Hanamura.

249
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,420
The lore building for Hanzo, Genji, and Kiriko.

250
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:59,000
And then this is also Hanamura.

251
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,060
I remember this.

252
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,300
They're just missing, like, the thing there.

253
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,520
And this is the Team Deathmatch here.

254
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,240
This is Team Deathmatch.

255
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,040
This is Han...

256
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:08,600
Oh, no.

257
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,200
This is...

258
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,360
Yeah, this is Team Deathmatch.

259
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:15,220
Yeah, this is literally, like, a mixture between the Team Deathmatch map and then Hanamura.

260
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:17,440
So I'm like, oh, it just looks like that.

261
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,520
I'm curious about Anubis.

262
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,320
I think Anubis might be interesting.

263
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,880
The new Anubis.

264
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,500
Let me look at that real quick.

265
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,420
All right.

266
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,640
All right, here we go.

267
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:33,780
What's funny?

268
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:34,800
I love...

269
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,320
Like, not love, but, like, the current, like...

270
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:47,540
The current, like, Twitter drama beef about Anubis is the fact that they chose Reaper to represent Anubis.

271
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:50,120
And people were like, why the fuck not Ramatra?

272
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:56,140
The people were really mad.

273
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,860
There was...

274
00:11:58,860 --> 00:11:59,800
There wasn't...

275
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:04,220
There was not only that, but there was the Overwatch skins drama.

276
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,500
Because they announced another Mercy skin and another Kiriko skin.

277
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,920
And everybody...

278
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,120
Like, and apparently Venture still hasn't...

279
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:16,840
Still doesn't have, like, a skin yet.

280
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,060
Or apparently, like, a new skin yet.

281
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:20,080
And then my...

282
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,140
One of my favorite...

283
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:21,800
One of my fav...

284
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,940
Like, so everybody is, like, yelling at Kiriko and Mercy mains right now.

285
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,680
Because everybody was like, another skin for Mercy and Kiriko?

286
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,440
And...

287
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,400
And...

288
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,500
And then I...

289
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,900
There was this meme that's being posted of, like, fucking...

290
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,420
Of, like...

291
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:43,360
Like, basically, Mercy and Venture players being overfed as hell.

292
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,140
While...

293
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:47,300
While, like, all the other characters are dehydrated.

294
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,300
You know, exactly.

295
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,320
They're, like...

296
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,000
They're, like, when...

297
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,060
My favorite...

298
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:57,420
Someone was like, you know when Blizzard needs to pay the bills.

299
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:01,540
When they release another Mercy and Kiriko skin.

300
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,320
But, like, the MVP...

301
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:05,740
I mean...

302
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:06,600
I mean true.

303
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,920
They are the ones that buy skins.

304
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:10,840
There's no...

305
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,560
Guys, it's...

306
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:16,200
There's not enough Venture players to justify making another skin for them, guys.

307
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,380
Like, there's not enough Venture players.

308
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,280
We all know...

309
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:24,060
DPS players don't really buy...

310
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:24,520
Like, okay.

311
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,380
Some DPS players do buy skins.

312
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:30,000
But, if you compare the Mercy skin players...

313
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,720
The Mercy players versus...

314
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:38,660
There's more people buying Mercy skins than there are people buying the entirety of DPS skins.

315
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:39,440
I'll say it.

316
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:42,400
I ain't afraid to say it.

317
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,600
And we all know it's true.

318
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:58,660
And when you combine all the people that buy Mercy skins versus DPS, the whole entire DPS category, there will still be more people buying Mercy skins than there are DPS skins.

319
00:13:58,660 --> 00:13:59,920
It doesn't matter.

320
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,840
It doesn't matter if the skin is so fucking cool.

321
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,480
They know their market.

322
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,560
The thing is, Mercy players, they want all the Mercy skins.

323
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,260
Like, no joke, even back in my prime.

324
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:21,600
Like, even back in my prime in Overwatch, like, I would see so many people bragging about, like, the completion-ness of Mercy.

325
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:31,800
That's why some people were willing, before the pink Mercy skins, before the crash of the pink Mercy skin stock market.

326
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,160
Oh, that's Anubis.

327
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:38,900
Before the crash of the pink Mercy skin Anubis, those skins sold for, like, more than a thousand dollars.

328
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:42,080
Because, like, accounts that had pink Mercy skin.

329
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:46,680
Because people were like, people were like, we have to complete the collection.

330
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:50,560
Like, we have to complete the Mercy collection.

331
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:54,260
And I do not see any DPS players doing that.

332
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,060
You guys gotta show your devotion.

333
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:00,860
If you want that skin.

334
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,280
Alright.

335
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:04,540
Not gonna lie...

336
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,440
I'm not...

337
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,160
It's just Anubis.

338
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:12,980
Like, there's the Anubis door.

339
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:15,040
It's just Anubis.

340
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,300
And then there's...

341
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,600
Is that Horus?

342
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:18,420
I assume?

343
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:21,680
I can't remember my Egyptian gods right now.

344
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:26,440
That's also Anubis.

345
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,260
I'm gonna get so many people mad if I say that.

346
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,240
And then there's...

347
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,640
And then there's Anubis.

348
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,520
And then...

349
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,300
Bring back...

350
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,380
No, absolutely not.

351
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:38,020
I don't...

352
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:38,560
Paris?

353
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,960
Paris is the most terrible map.

354
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,040
Paris, no.

355
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,720
Keep Paris locked up.

356
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,580
No amount of improvement can ever fix Paris.

357
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:53,960
I had people legitimately quit games.

358
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,800
Like, leave ranked games.

359
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,240
Because of how bad.

360
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:58,640
How dodgy.

361
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,400
The Paris map was.

362
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,480
In like...

363
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,020
Not like in low elo.

364
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:06,520
In fucking grandmaster games, chat.

365
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,680
Like, Lunar Calling was bad.

366
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,620
But at least it was not Paris bad.

367
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,710
Like, I actually...

368
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,720
Legitimately had people in grandmaster...

369
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,900
Like, grandmaster players...

370
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:20,000
Willingly leave games.

371
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,100
So they don't have to play this.

372
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,960
They don't have to play Paris.

373
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,620
It's actually crazy how bad that map is.

374
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,520
Like...

375
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,160
Like...

376
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:33,400
Like...

377
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,220
That...

378
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:34,600
Like...

379
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,080
They're like...

380
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:35,660
Elo...

381
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:36,180
They're like...

382
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:37,200
Elo is not worth...

383
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,220
Like, to them, they're like...

384
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:39,060
Elo is...

385
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:42,220
Paris is to the point where Elo is not worth it for their sanity.

386
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:43,020
Like...

387
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:49,420
What makes the Paris map bad?

388
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,640
It's just very poorly designed.

389
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:52,820
Um...

390
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,260
Attacking it is hell.

391
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,660
Because they have like 200 fucking high ground.

392
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,320
So it's very hard to...

393
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,480
Contest the high ground.

394
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:00,680
Because like...

395
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,060
Uh...

396
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:01,700
They have like...

397
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:02,760
This platform thing.

398
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:03,900
And then...

399
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:04,520
Obviously...

400
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,920
To get to high ground...

401
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,540
You have to...

402
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,180
Walk past people.

403
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,200
It's similar to Lunar Colony.

404
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,340
Lunar Colony people have like...

405
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:13,240
So many high ground.

406
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:13,960
So like...

407
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:14,880
Imagine like...

408
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,360
The...

409
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,860
In order to like...

410
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:17,860
Get past...

411
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:18,720
To the point...

412
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,000
You have to contest a...

413
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,020
Full high ground players here.

414
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,060
And then...

415
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:25,300
The only way to get past high ground...

416
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,800
Is you have to walk...

417
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,360
To here.

418
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:28,300
Look at this!

419
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:28,480
Look at them.

420
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,960
And then turn right.

421
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,860
And then the high ground players...

422
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:34,460
Can all look at you...

423
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,240
While you try...

424
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:35,720
And then...

425
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,440
And then walk up the stairs.

426
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:37,960
Like...

427
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:38,260
Literally.

428
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,340
Or walk up here.

429
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:40,040
Like...

430
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:40,480
It was...

431
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,500
It was that bad.

432
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:43,680
So...

433
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,740
So imagine...

434
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:44,940
Okay.

435
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,340
This is literally how Paris looks like.

436
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:46,560
Okay.

437
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,000
So the corridors were a lot smaller.

438
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,320
It was a lot smaller.

439
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,420
And you were just like...

440
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:51,180
You have to walk.

441
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,800
You see all of them here.

442
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:53,660
They're all like...

443
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:54,040
Being like...

444
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:54,920
What the fuck are you doing?

445
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,440
And then you have to...

446
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,380
See them.

447
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,700
And then walk here.

448
00:17:58,840 --> 00:17:59,740
In a corridor.

449
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:00,940
So...

450
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:01,500
I don't know.

451
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,260
I don't know if you can actually select Paris.

452
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:04,560
I'll be funny if you can.

453
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,020
Wait.

454
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,000
Is Paris...

455
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,840
Can you like actually...

456
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,000
Bring back Paris?

457
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:09,400
In custom settings?

458
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:10,940
Let's try it out.

459
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:12,260
All right.

460
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:12,880
Let's see.

461
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,900
Is there still...

462
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,120
Is there still 2CP?

463
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:16,480
No.

464
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,740
They literally got rid of it.

465
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:19,900
Wait.

466
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:20,340
Unless...

467
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:20,500
Wait.

468
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:20,800
Is it?

469
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:21,760
Is it this?

470
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:22,140
Okay.

471
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:22,860
All right.

472
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:23,320
Let's see.

473
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:24,900
All right.

474
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:25,560
I'll show you guys.

475
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:26,480
No.

476
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,280
That is...

477
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:27,660
Oh my god.

478
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:28,120
That's control.

479
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:28,900
I don't know.

480
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,640
I forgot the names of everything.

481
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:31,940
It's been so long.

482
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:32,760
I...

483
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:34,900
It's a sub.

484
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:35,980
I was like...

485
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:37,320
I saw like 2CP.

486
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:37,880
And I was like...

487
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,160
C.

488
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:38,540
Control.

489
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,560
I didn't know why.

490
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,200
I was like...

491
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:43,580
C.

492
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:44,440
Control.

493
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:45,680
All right.

494
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:46,300
Let's see.

495
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:47,220
All right.

496
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:47,980
I'll show you...

497
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:51,780
I'll show you why this is one of the most hated maps of all of Overwatch.

498
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:53,540
All right.

499
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:54,280
Here we go.

500
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:57,320
All right.

501
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:02,780
And then Lunar Colony faces a similar issue, but not as bad as...

502
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:04,740
Not as bad as...

503
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,340
As Paris.

504
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:06,940
So...

505
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:07,400
All right.

506
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,920
So as defender...

507
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,980
As the defender...

508
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:11,560
Oh my god.

509
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,180
I forgot this is...

510
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:17,180
They turned this into a team deathmatch map because they're like, we already made Paris.

511
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,040
Wait.

512
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,900
What do we do with this?

513
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:21,220
All right.

514
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:21,820
You see that?

515
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:23,320
You see that?

516
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:24,880
For those who've never played Paris...

517
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,180
You said, Paris.

518
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:26,200
All right, here it is.

519
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:27,200
You thought I was...

520
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:27,860
Here it is.

521
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:30,080
Literally, I look at you.

522
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,140
Literally.

523
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,640
You can't do anything...

524
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,020
You have to walk here.

525
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,280
You're attacking...

526
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,760
You walk up....

527
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,460
You die.

528
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,400
And you know what was meta...

529
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,300
You have to walk here.

530
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:54,860
You know what was meta?

531
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,500
Oh my god!

532
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,260
Fucking Junkrat!

533
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,540
They just... they're like, oh, I didn't get a shield!

534
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,920
Then we get one fucker playing Junkrat!

535
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,180
And then they just spam this corridor!

536
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,740
And then they just...

537
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:06,640
They just...

538
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,820
Spam this corridor!

539
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,900
Over and over and over and over!

540
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,080
And Torb Junkrat right here!

541
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:14,700
They just spam this...

542
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:15,880
Pew pew pew pew pew!

543
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:20,680
And then you were like, oh no!

544
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:21,660
What do I do?

545
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:22,920
Um...

546
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,480
So this was fucking terrible to play!

547
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:29,080
Because you have like one second to be like...

548
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,500
But then obviously they're spamming!

549
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:35,880
Or you, you know, you be a little bossy and go here and storm...

550
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,120
You storm the high ground.

551
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:37,840
Here.

552
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,480
Nobody would ever go left!

553
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:41,340
Cause like, if you go left...

554
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:45,420
Like, look at how much high ground they have here to kill you!

555
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,740
Um, and yeah!

556
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,780
That's why...

557
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,280
That's why nobody fucking...

558
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,400
Nobody fucking liked Paris!

559
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,840
It was so fucking bad to play!

560
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:54,800
Uh...

561
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:59,160
They all had every high ground possible!

562
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,680
Uh, so yeah!

563
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,660
That's why they...

564
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:06,920
I'm pretty sure Paris is one of the main reasons why they like, got...

565
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:12,340
I'm 100% certain Paris is like the main reason why 2CP does not exist anymore.

566
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,860
Paris was that bad.

567
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,360
And then, um...

568
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,500
People were like, okay...

569
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,700
People really hated Lunar Colony as well, but...

570
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:24,120
For those who never had Lunar Colony...

571
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:27,060
It got so bad, they literally took Paris out of rotation.

572
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:28,820
Like...

573
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,120
The fact that like...

574
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:35,520
The Paris map got taken out of rotation and then later on...

575
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,300
2CP was gone forever.

576
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,020
I love Lunar Colony.

577
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:43,200
It's so fucking terrible to play attack on.

578
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:45,580
Though, it's against high elo players.

579
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:49,980
So, it's similar, but like, you know, they all have the high ground here.

580
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:59,340
So all they do is just go... they just go pew pew pew pew pew pew pew pew pew pew pew and then when, you know, you're defending...

581
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:06,880
It's a little bit easier because you can come from here or here and then you just go like that and then you're free.

582
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:07,660
I guess.

583
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:11,840
Because their high ground is also like...

584
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,720
Their high ground is higher.

585
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:14,980
It's higher.

586
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:21,860
So like, less chance to really be able to kill you because they have to... they have more distance to shoot you.

587
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:27,260
And then I guess, but in high elo it's still fucking hell because they can... they have aim.

588
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,200
Like, they...

589
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:32,180
Yeah, but they have more distance.

590
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,720
So, it's harder for higher elo.

591
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:37,980
It's so fucking hell in higher elo because they can still aim.

592
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:40,740
It's not like they can't fucking aim for shit.

593
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:50,240
But like, it is easier to storm the high ground versus Paris because, like, they're further away from you.

594
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:53,680
Like, they have to be here or usually they're like here.

595
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:59,180
But yeah, that was the life of 2CP.

596
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,260
That was... those were the only shit maps in 2CP.

597
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:03,340
The other maps were fine.

598
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,520
I was fine with the other maps.

599
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:08,940
It might take like 20 years to finish a game, but like I was fine.

600
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:13,400
I had like no issues with it.

601
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,460
Alright, let's try out Juno.

602
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,280
Oh wait, I want to do Clash.

603
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:18,160
Okay, wait.

604
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,020
Clash should be in our arcade, right?

605
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:20,920
Yeah, there it is.

606
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,660
Alright, let's try out Clash and Juno.

607
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:24,280
Yeah.

608
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,420
I've had I've had 2CP games that went max.

609
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,360
One time.

610
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:38,240
One time I actually legitimately played the maxed out, the maxed out 2CP limit on Volskaya.

611
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,660
It was literally on Volskaya where you can max it out.

612
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:53,860
Volskaya had such a snowball um like map design that is the easiest to make it all the way to the end.

613
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:58,940
Yes, right.

614
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:00,260
You don't get Juno.

615
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:01,660
I get Juno.

616
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,460
All the OG maps were really cool.

617
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:09,780
I enjoyed all of them.

618
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:19,640
I loved Anubis, Volskaya, Hanamura, King's Row, Route 66.

619
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:25,860
Route 66 I've started not enjoying it as much because it's like I don't know.

620
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:31,020
It's just as a support player, Route 66 is not that fun for me.

621
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,700
It's very stressful.

622
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:43,640
I feel like out of all the maps for support for the OG maps Route 66 is like one of the most stressful maps to play as a support player.

623
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:46,720
Alright.

624
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:47,640
I enjoyed Hanamura.

625
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,000
Yeah.

626
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,040
I actually enjoyed it.

627
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:50,380
Alright.

628
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,620
How the fuck do you play this map?

629
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,060
What the fuck?

630
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:55,260
Alright.

631
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,040
Yeah.

632
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:00,680
Alright.

633
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:01,180
Let's go.

634
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:03,460
Let's figure this out.

635
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,320
Alright.

636
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:08,940
Okay.

637
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:11,740
How do I do that?

638
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,040
Alright.

639
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:18,560
Okay.

640
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,740
It's not that bad.

641
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:29,800
I mean it's pretty...

642
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,360
It's pretty...

643
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,200
You can lead to heal botting.

644
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:34,780
Not gonna lie.

645
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:37,280
Oh!

646
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,480
It's literally right there.

647
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:39,440
It's right next to me.

648
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,000
I don't know how you feel.

649
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:44,200
I mean this is literally like the first couple of games.

650
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:46,520
Oh!

651
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:47,160
Poop!

652
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:48,380
Alright.

653
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,540
What the fuck was he doing?

654
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:51,660
Go away!

655
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,140
I got you!

656
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,240
I got you!

657
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,320
That's fucking right!

658
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,120
I got you!

659
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:00,980
I can... Oh shit!

660
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:01,880
Give me a sec.

661
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:03,340
Give me a sec.

662
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:04,240
Lara, you gotta help him.

663
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:07,840
Oh shit!

664
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,180
Okay.

665
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:08,580
Don't worry.

666
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,620
Please kill Zarya!

667
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:14,880
I think he's shooting him!

668
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:20,500
Somebody kill him!

669
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:21,060
Somebody kill him!

670
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:21,720
Alright.

671
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,920
We captured another point.

672
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:23,340
Nice.

673
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,180
That was easy.

674
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,140
Alright.

675
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:28,980
We're good.

676
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,260
I almost have ult.

677
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:32,880
Alright.

678
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:35,460
I wanna use my ult for the next capture.

679
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:36,480
I wanna use my ult for the next capture.

680
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,280
I need to like be aware of the...

681
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:40,900
I need to like be aware of the...

682
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,040
Okay.

683
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:43,800
Oh no!

684
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:46,020
There was no way to save you!

685
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:50,960
How the fuck was I supposed to save you?

686
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:55,580
How the fuck was I supposed to save you?

687
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:56,180
Oh god.

688
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,800
The point is gonna open.

689
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:58,460
Wait.

690
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,080
Where's the point?

691
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:02,620
Wait.

692
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:03,180
Where's the point?

693
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:03,520
Wait.

694
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:03,520
Where's the point?

695
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,840
Oh it's over there!

696
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:06,540
Oh god.

697
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,400
No!

698
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,180
Alright.

699
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:13,680
Oh it's fine.

700
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,180
That's fine.

701
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:14,320
Oh god.

702
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:16,600
Orbit time!

703
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:19,280
Oh.

704
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:21,020
Nice.

705
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:23,540
Alright.

706
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:23,900
We're good.

707
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:24,740
Easy!

708
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:26,780
Alright.

709
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,400
This is such a fast-paced game.

710
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,320
Holy shit.

711
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:30,420
Alright.

712
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,460
That's another point.

713
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,780
This is super fast-paced.

714
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:36,820
I don't know if I like that.

715
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:41,680
We'll see.

716
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,260
Let me go.

717
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:44,840
Let me go.

718
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:46,600
Let me go.

719
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:47,820
Wait.

720
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:48,860
The point is this...

721
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:49,360
Oh wait.

722
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:49,480
No.

723
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,440
We haven't capped it!

724
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,320
I'm trying my best!

725
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:54,840
Please!

726
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:57,120
My heal output is not as much as I thought it was!

727
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:57,760
Please!

728
00:27:58,580 --> 00:27:58,580
My heal output is not as much as I thought it was!

729
00:27:58,580 --> 00:27:58,580
Please!

730
00:27:58,580 --> 00:27:58,720
My heal output is not as much as I thought it was!

731
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,320
Okay.

732
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:02,720
Oh he's one!

733
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:06,660
He's one!

734
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:10,940
That's fucking right.

735
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,140
You can't fucking kill me.

736
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,820
I'm gonna fucking fly to you.

737
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,120
Oh shit!

738
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:15,440
I'm sorry!

739
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:24,080
I didn't realize...

740
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,060
I forgot...

741
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:26,460
Like...

742
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:29,780
That point is literally in their spawn.

743
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,140
Like how...

744
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:33,780
The point is literally in their spawn.

745
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:34,840
How is that fair?

746
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,960
How is that fucking fair?

747
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,640
It's literally in their spawn!

748
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,200
Alright.

749
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:47,960
We need to...

750
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:52,880
Okay.

751
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:55,260
Oh I need to get away from that.

752
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,380
Oh god.

753
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:58,040
How do I... No.

754
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,560
No I can't get to you!

755
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,560
You're behind the wall!

756
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:01,740
I'm trying my best!

757
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:03,180
I'm trying my best!

758
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:03,580
No!

759
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,240
It's okay.

760
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:06,880
I can fly away.

761
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:10,100
Alright.

762
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:11,960
That's the neat part.

763
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,940
That's the neat part.

764
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:14,960
No.

765
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:17,560
No.

766
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,400
Don't worry I got you.

767
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:24,930
That's fine.

768
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:27,450
I don't think I could do that in rank though.

769
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:29,110
I don't think I could do that in rank though.

770
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:31,930
These people actually have aim in rank.

771
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:36,010
I know like there's no SPMM in arcades.

772
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:37,690
I know like there's no SPMM in arcades.

773
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:43,470
I get front line as support.

774
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:45,850
Alright.

775
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:46,850
Nice we got another.

776
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:48,310
Alright.

777
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:52,070
Yeah no arcade I can tell they don't have aim.

778
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:53,110
So I'm not like...

779
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:55,310
I'm not like intimidated.

780
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:01,850
I'm not very intimidated with this team.

781
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:02,150
I'm not very intimidated with this team.

782
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:03,270
Alright.

783
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:07,130
It unlocks at 14 seconds.

784
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:07,870
I'm gonna wait.

785
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:10,330
Did I kill anybody?

786
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:11,550
Oh no.

787
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,050
It's okay I fly away.

788
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:14,430
Fly away.

789
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:14,910
Oh.

790
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:15,930
I guess not.

791
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:18,890
I should have used my ult.

792
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:22,190
How was I supposed to know that was gonna happen?

793
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:23,330
Oh.

794
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:24,350
Goodbye.

795
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:25,370
Sorry.

796
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:26,930
I'm sorry I leave you.

797
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:30,950
Sorry I'm sorry.

798
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:32,370
What the fuck?

799
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:35,750
What the fuck is wrong with you?

800
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:37,670
Holy shit!

801
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:39,850
Get away from me!

802
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:41,370
Fucking idiots.

803
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:46,590
You're still here?

804
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:47,370
What?

805
00:30:49,810 --> 00:30:52,350
Is he still here?

806
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:54,310
How did I get to him?

807
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,920
He's hungry.

808
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,940
Oh my god.

809
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,420
How the fuck is he still there?

810
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,420
Stupid ass soldier.

811
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:07,740
Okay.

812
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:07,940
Shit.

813
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:10,900
I'm trying to like figure out some of these.

814
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:14,780
These.

815
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:17,840
Alright.

816
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,180
Stupid soldier.

817
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:27,960
It's fine.

818
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:28,880
I'm not scared.

819
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,260
Oh shit.

820
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:31,560
Alright.

821
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:32,200
There you go.

822
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:33,600
Oh!

823
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:34,520
They got him?

824
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:35,260
No way!

825
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,220
They pushed him away!

826
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:39,600
Goodbye.

827
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:39,940
Goodbye.

828
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,120
Stop!

829
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,020
Oh my god!

830
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:46,640
Stop!

831
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,760
Oh my god.

832
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:53,040
It's just we're getting staggered.

833
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:57,080
This hard punishes staggers so much.

834
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,200
It sucks.

835
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:01,180
Cause like it punishes staggering.

836
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:03,780
To a big degree.

837
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:06,220
Cause the moment you respawn the point's open.

838
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:08,320
So it's not very great.

839
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:09,260
There we go.

840
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,320
Oh no!

841
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:14,280
My orbit!

842
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,080
It

843
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:20,550
staggers!

844
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:22,950
Guys, I think we might lose.

845
00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:29,250
Oh my god.

846
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:31,470
Why do I always get carbon?

847
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:34,650
I always get carbon.

848
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:39,030
Every time.

849
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:41,630
Every time.

850
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:41,970
Every time.

851
00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:42,470
Oh no.

852
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:46,230
Yeah, this is like a hard stagger punishment.

853
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:47,410
I don't like that.

854
00:32:49,530 --> 00:32:50,550
Oh no.

855
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:51,550
We lost, guys.

856
00:32:56,950 --> 00:32:58,770
I got the...

857
00:32:58,770 --> 00:32:58,890
I got the...

858
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:02,010
Oh my god.

859
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:02,370
Oh my god.

860
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:05,290
Please.

861
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:09,790
Oh god, please.

862
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:11,790
Let's go in.

863
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:14,450
What do you want me to do?

864
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:15,190
I was flying!

865
00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:17,050
No!

866
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:19,430
No!

867
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:21,630
That was so cocky!

868
00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:26,370
That was so cocky!

869
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:28,470
I was like, it's so easy.

870
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:33,790
Oh my god.

871
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:36,030
Why was I so cocky?

872
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:37,410
Every time!

873
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:40,090
Every fucking time!

874
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:44,950
Carbon.

875
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:47,130
It's not fair!

876
00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:48,950
Okay, I hate clash.

877
00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:50,630
Now I'm def...

878
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:52,590
Now I'm a real hater.

879
00:33:57,750 --> 00:34:00,230
It's cause the staggers fucking suck.

880
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:02,310
Cause the moment you get...

881
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:04,590
The moment they stagger you, the point opens.

882
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:05,850
That's so tilted.

883
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:07,470
And they get like...

884
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:10,290
They get a point so fast.

885
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:11,810
Like, what the fuck?

886
00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:12,970
Like...

887
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:17,990
It just feels like...

888
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:19,870
Yeah.

889
00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:22,090
It just feels like the staggering...

890
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:23,790
The snowballing is like...

891
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:24,390
Even worse.

892
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:27,370
Yeah, it punishes...

893
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:29,530
It punishes you even more when you...

894
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:32,250
When you die too late.

895
00:34:32,450 --> 00:34:33,590
I guess that's why.

896
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:35,070
Apparently they're thinking of...

897
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:37,310
They're thinking of making it so that...

898
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:38,310
Um...

899
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:39,710
You don't...

900
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:42,250
You can't get staggered because of the clash game mode.

901
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:45,350
Like, they're planning on changing it.

902
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:47,470
Um...

903
00:34:47,470 --> 00:34:49,610
Yeah, it punishes you for inting without your team.

904
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:50,890
But like...

905
00:34:50,890 --> 00:34:52,150
I can't fucking stop!

906
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:52,850
Stupid!

907
00:34:55,910 --> 00:34:59,070
I was waiting for my take this entire time!

908
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:01,270
Um...

909
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:02,290
But like, I don't know if you guys heard.

910
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:04,010
But they were planning on removing staggering.

911
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:07,650
So like, the first person that dies triggers the respawn thing.

912
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:11,010
So like, the fifth person will respawn with the first person.

913
00:35:12,370 --> 00:35:13,350
So like, the fifth person will respawn with the first person.

914
00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:15,010
I don't know how I feel about that too.

915
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:16,910
Honestly.

916
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:18,890
I don't know how I feel about that.

917
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:21,650
Because like, there's been a whole strat about like...

918
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:22,150
Because like, there's been a whole strat about like...

919
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:23,290
It's like team play, you know?

920
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:25,130
Being able to stagger people.

921
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:28,880
Whoa!

922
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:29,500
Whoa!

923
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:32,560
Okay, I did not expect him to kill me that fast.

924
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:33,660
Alright.

925
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,680
Alright, I'll actually heal now.

926
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:37,320
For real.

927
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:41,960
Alright.

928
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:48,340
That's fucking right.

929
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,720
Maximum velocity, bitch.

930
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:53,600
Alright.

931
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:54,940
Nice.

932
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:58,700
Yeah, see, you literally win one fight and then you win the point.

933
00:35:59,180 --> 00:35:59,940
There's like...

934
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:02,180
There's no way for them to...

935
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,220
There's no way for them to contest.

936
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,100
That's why I was like, eh.

937
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:09,340
That's how I feel about it so far.

938
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:10,760
That's how I feel about it so far.

939
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:13,420
It shouldn't be one fight and then automatically a point.

940
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:13,780
It shouldn't be one fight and then automatically a point.

941
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:14,020
I feel.

942
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:16,760
Let's see.

943
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,520
Alright, where's my teams?

944
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:21,120
Where are they?

945
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:21,940
Where's the point?

946
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:22,560
Oh god.

947
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,080
Okay.

948
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:24,680
Like, okay.

949
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:25,620
Oh, nice, nice.

950
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:26,920
Nice for Matra.

951
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:30,400
What the fuck?

952
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,860
You just let him do that, Soldier?

953
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:36,220
Soldier, you just...

954
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:39,760
You just...

955
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:46,730
The thing about 2CP though, like, it's defense side.

956
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:47,910
It's the...

957
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:50,650
You can have, like, good...

958
00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:54,150
You have... The respawn is literally right next to you.

959
00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:56,150
So, like, it's not as...

960
00:36:57,610 --> 00:36:58,490
I'm trying.

961
00:36:58,650 --> 00:36:59,630
Oh, I tried.

962
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:01,430
I don't know if you saw me.

963
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:04,110
I was literally walking up to it.

964
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:07,230
Okay.

965
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:07,670
Alright.

966
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:08,230
Nice.

967
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:11,530
Oh my god, you're still here?

968
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:15,470
Why are you still here?

969
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:16,310
Mercy, please.

970
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:17,550
Please, Mercy, please.

971
00:37:17,650 --> 00:37:18,570
I just need you.

972
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:24,650
Oh, it's cause the point was right next to me.

973
00:37:24,930 --> 00:37:26,310
Oh, that's why.

974
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:27,110
Okay.

975
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:29,050
I was like, why are you still here?

976
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:31,030
I'm gonna save this.

977
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:32,070
Okay, guess not.

978
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:33,530
Because somehow we're losing.

979
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:38,810
Oh, please.

980
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:40,130
This fuck... I'm mad.

981
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:44,850
I'm gonna kill this Reaper.

982
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:49,010
I'm mad now.

983
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:53,010
Juno has not enough DPS for me to kill this Reaper.

984
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:57,370
I'm fucking mad.

985
00:37:57,790 --> 00:37:59,310
Bro, fuck this Reaper.

986
00:38:00,830 --> 00:38:03,870
I wish it's not role queue so I can play DPS.

987
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:07,090
The damage is not enough.

988
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:11,330
Where are you?

989
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:14,770
Where are you?

990
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:16,230
Where are you?

991
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:17,050
Get out of here.

992
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:18,790
Get over here.

993
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:20,350
Get over here, Reaper.

994
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:21,210
I see you.

995
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:23,310
Good.

996
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:25,750
Alright.

997
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:27,430
Alright.

998
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:27,810
Alright.

999
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:28,630
There.

1000
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:30,770
Are you fucking kidding me?

1001
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:34,490
Where is the point?

1002
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:35,490
Oh, it's back here.

1003
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:37,590
Guys, the point is back here, guys.

1004
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:38,770
We gotta get the point.

1005
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:40,710
There we go.

1006
00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:42,510
There we go.

1007
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:43,470
Less mad now.

1008
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:49,130
I am less mad.

1009
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:53,190
I just needed to play Ana.

1010
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:55,030
Alright.

1011
00:38:55,490 --> 00:38:56,370
There we go.

1012
00:38:56,870 --> 00:39:00,830
I still don't know how I feel about Juno so far.

1013
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:02,110
I don't know.

1014
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:05,150
Juno is definitely not a...

1015
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:06,170
Not a main.

1016
00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:07,250
She doesn't feel...

1017
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:08,670
Fuck you.

1018
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:10,290
Yeah, that's fucking right, bitch.

1019
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:13,290
God, you fucker!

1020
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:20,150
Oh my...

1021
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:22,610
Yeah, fuck you!

1022
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:25,810
Hahaha.

1023
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:27,310
Yes!

1024
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:31,440
Yes!

1025
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:35,700
I already went this so much!

1026
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:36,620
I...

1027
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:39,900
I had the passion knock me off.

1028
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:43,060
Are you fucking kidding me?

1029
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,240
Are you fucking kidding me?

1030
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,740
Everything is not going for Doki right now.

1031
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:48,300
Everything is not going for Doki right now.

1032
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:49,640
Everybody wants to kill Doki.

1033
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,500
Everybody wants to kill Doki.

1034
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,240
Holy fuck.

1035
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:57,140
Anyway, I'm heading over, guys.

1036
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:58,840
I'm still figuring out this map.

1037
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:01,380
I'm heading over.

1038
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:02,980
Just walk away from that!

1039
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:03,840
Just walk away!

1040
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:06,120
Oh.

1041
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:08,920
Looks like they're not gonna be walking away.

1042
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:10,580
Looks like.

1043
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,540
I will fucking kill you.

1044
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:14,340
Hahaha.

1045
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:16,780
Or not.

1046
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:17,620
I guess not.

1047
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:19,680
I guess not.

1048
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:22,980
Guys, I don't think we're gonna make it.

1049
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:26,880
There we go.

1050
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,700
Oh god.

1051
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:30,220
Please.

1052
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:31,660
Hahaha.

1053
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,560
Oh my god.

1054
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:35,200
I'm kidding.

1055
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:37,880
Everybody hates me.

1056
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,280
Please, we have no heals.

1057
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:44,100
We have no heals.

1058
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:45,120
Please, survive!

1059
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:47,300
Survive!

1060
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:49,880
Please!

1061
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:51,360
Just turn around!

1062
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:55,340
I will kill this.

1063
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:57,360
Reaper if it's the last thing I do.

1064
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:03,140
Dude, fuck this Reaper though.

1065
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:04,440
Please!

1066
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:06,820
Somebody shoot anybody else!

1067
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:09,960
Alright.

1068
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:13,520
Apparently that was low ground.

1069
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,420
I don't know how I got there, but okay.

1070
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,020
Oh my god!

1071
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:18,300
I swear to god.

1072
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,440
Okay, I can literally heal here.

1073
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:23,700
Alright.

1074
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,120
I kept falling down.

1075
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,020
Hahaha.

1076
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:30,200
I kept falling down.

1077
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,140
Because I didn't know where...

1078
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:34,040
I didn't know where the...

1079
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,760
Where it ends.

1080
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:39,600
Please.

1081
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:40,320
Why?

1082
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,800
Why did you wake him up?

1083
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:42,420
Guys.

1084
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:46,360
Why did you wake him up?

1085
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:46,640
Guys.

1086
00:41:47,450 --> 00:41:47,740
No!

1087
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,500
I swear to god!

1088
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:56,780
Just touch him!

1089
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:57,540
Hahaha!

1090
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:00,820
Please.

1091
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,880
You guys get on the point!

1092
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:05,360
Get on the point!

1093
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:06,240
It's literally...

1094
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,140
Junkerqueen and she's 1 HP!

1095
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:09,520
Alright.

1096
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:10,580
Who poked him?

1097
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:12,260
Who poked him?

1098
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:14,140
I hate it when people poke him.

1099
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,540
He solo ulted me.

1100
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,500
I hate him just as much as he hates me.

1101
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:19,800
That's good to know.

1102
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:21,680
Like, that makes me happy.

1103
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:22,940
Knowing that.

1104
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:27,620
Knowing that he also hates me.

1105
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,000
Knowing that he also hates me.

1106
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:30,660
Where are you?

1107
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:32,820
I will kill every reaper I see.

1108
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,560
I have ult already?

1109
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:36,220
I have ult already?

1110
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:36,220
Jesus.

1111
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,640
I was not expecting that.

1112
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:40,780
I'm saving...

1113
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:42,640
I'm gonna save this for when I see the reaper.

1114
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:45,940
Oh, I see you.

1115
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:47,320
I see you.

1116
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:50,080
I see you.

1117
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:52,180
Kill him.

1118
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:53,320
Kill him.

1119
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,020
This sounds personal.

1120
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:01,060
It is 100% personal.

1121
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:01,340
It is 100% personal.

1122
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:01,740
There he is.

1123
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:04,840
Alright.

1124
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:06,860
Yeah!

1125
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:08,540
Alright.

1126
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:10,080
I don't like this game mode.

1127
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:11,860
I'm gonna fucking cry when it's in rank.

1128
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:16,720
You know what?

1129
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:19,060
You know what?

1130
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,660
It got me wanting to...

1131
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:22,120
I wanna play damage.

1132
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:22,840
We'll do damage!

1133
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:24,020
And then we're gonna try out rank.

1134
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:26,240
It's only game.

1135
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:27,680
I gotta be mad.

1136
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:30,060
When you have this one fucker.

1137
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:31,760
When you have this... it's not.

1138
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:35,620
Usually, Juno and Clash, it takes like two weeks.

1139
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:36,980
Two weeks.

1140
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:38,180
Oh, it is already in...

1141
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:38,900
Oh, no.

1142
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,280
It's already in rank.

1143
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:44,640
No.

1144
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:48,400
That sounds terrible.

1145
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:51,620
That sounds terrible.

1146
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:54,040
Oh, no.

1147
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,840
That sounds terrible.

1148
00:43:57,940 --> 00:43:58,740
That sounds terrible.

1149
00:43:58,740 --> 00:43:59,920
Are people okay?

1150
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:02,120
Are people okay?

1151
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:03,460
Oh, alright.

1152
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:04,700
Well...

1153
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:07,000
I guess...

1154
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,360
I guess we all just suffer.

1155
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:10,660
I guess we just suffer, I guess.

1156
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:12,000
I guess we just suffer, I guess.

1157
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,640
I hated my rank.

1158
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:23,120
I used to really hate...

1159
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:24,860
I used to really hate...

1160
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:25,380
eh..

1161
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:30,000
eh,, push...

1162
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,420
Now I can't believe there's a game that makes me hate...

1163
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:36,000
What the fuck?

1164
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:37,800
That makes me hate...

1165
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:40,300
rank even more.

1166
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:41,640
I can't believe it..

1167
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:44,040
I can't believe they actually made a game world worse than PUSH.

1168
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:46,000
That's so... that's impressive.

1169
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:49,540
That's actually so impressive.

1170
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:56,500
I think another issue with Clash is that the snowball doesn't stop.

1171
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,660
You can't... like, in 2CP, you can stop the snowball.

1172
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:02,740
Like, you... it doesn't... you know, you have two points.

1173
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:04,120
Like, after defense, you do attack.

1174
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:09,140
And then... but now... but now you have to deal with, like, a full snowball.

1175
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:10,080
You know?

1176
00:45:13,950 --> 00:45:14,470
Alright.

1177
00:45:16,190 --> 00:45:16,890
Here we go.

1178
00:45:17,130 --> 00:45:18,710
Now I will be the Reaper.

1179
00:45:19,210 --> 00:45:20,770
I shall be the Reaper.

1180
00:45:21,350 --> 00:45:25,670
I don't remember how to play Reaper, but, like, I shall be the Reaper player now.

1181
00:45:28,730 --> 00:45:29,250
Alright.

1182
00:45:32,330 --> 00:45:33,210
Stupid idiot.

1183
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:42,520
Now I'm the Reaper player.

1184
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:47,660
Give me my HP.

1185
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:54,360
I shall be cringe now.

1186
00:45:57,780 --> 00:46:01,040
I used to one-trick Reaper when the game first came out.

1187
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:04,420
Not as good, though, but, like...

1188
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:07,360
Let's see.

1189
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:10,200
Okay.

1190
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:15,860
Ooh, battery!

1191
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:16,740
All charge!

1192
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:17,720
All battery!

1193
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:18,300
Whoa!

1194
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:19,240
JK!

1195
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:20,960
Hello!

1196
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:21,960
Heal me now!

1197
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,800
Oh, they went, like, full...

1198
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:27,400
Maga cap... Maga mirrored?

1199
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:28,360
God, that's boring.

1200
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:34,500
Yay!

1201
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:38,680
Come on, Juno!

1202
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:39,960
That's fucking right!

1203
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:45,560
I will be cringe now!

1204
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:50,020
That's fucking right.

1205
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:53,500
It's my turn to be cringe.

1206
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:55,520
All right.

1207
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:55,940
Sweet.

1208
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:59,340
We just need... If we get that point, I guess we win.

1209
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:05,260
Die!

1210
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:06,100
Die!

1211
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:07,060
Die!

1212
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:08,480
Goodbye.

1213
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:11,400
Goodbye.

1214
00:47:11,990 --> 00:47:14,520
I do not want to be part of... part of this.

1215
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:15,720
All right.

1216
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:17,320
I'm gonna... flank now.

1217
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:20,540
They were so fucking over-healed.

1218
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:21,380
That was crazy.

1219
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:25,800
I'm so fucking crazy.

1220
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:27,940
There's no way.

1221
00:47:28,060 --> 00:47:28,300
No!

1222
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:29,720
Where did the brick come

1223
00:47:33,590 --> 00:47:33,970
from?

1224
00:47:34,510 --> 00:47:35,990
That's so fucked!

1225
00:47:37,770 --> 00:47:39,910
Where did it come from?

1226
00:47:40,510 --> 00:47:41,910
It came from the sky!

1227
00:47:43,050 --> 00:47:43,690
Okay.

1228
00:47:43,930 --> 00:47:44,910
That's all right.

1229
00:47:46,010 --> 00:47:47,110
That's all right.

1230
00:47:49,230 --> 00:47:50,070
All right.

1231
00:47:50,090 --> 00:47:50,770
Let's see.

1232
00:47:50,930 --> 00:47:52,070
I just need to kill their support.

1233
00:47:52,430 --> 00:47:53,350
I think...

1234
00:47:53,350 --> 00:47:55,970
I think they swapped a bird because they were pissed off at me.

1235
00:47:56,670 --> 00:47:57,770
I'm pretty sure.

1236
00:48:00,990 --> 00:48:01,510
Alright.

1237
00:48:02,530 --> 00:48:04,550
I'm not sure what everybody is.

1238
00:48:05,990 --> 00:48:06,990
Alright, here we go.

1239
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:12,400
Jesus Christ!

1240
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:14,660
Okay, I gotta swap off Reaper now.

1241
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:18,720
Woah, he...

1242
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:28,780
Yeah, we do.

1243
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,400
Okay, that's funny.

1244
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:35,620
Easy.

1245
00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:36,980
Nice!

1246
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:40,240
Fucking idiot.

1247
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,360
Get better at the game.

1248
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:44,680
Increase your game knowledge.

1249
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,720
How did that work?

1250
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:50,800
That's what separates me from you.

1251
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:54,980
Alright, let's see.

1252
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:56,640
Yeah, Reggie.

1253
00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:02,000
Reggie's gotta learn the game more.

1254
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:07,320
Woah!

1255
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:12,000
Hey there, buddy!

1256
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:13,420
Hey!

1257
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:15,620
Hey, buddy!

1258
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:17,440
Chase me, I guess.

1259
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:18,760
Hey, buddy!

1260
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:22,860
Holy shit.

1261
00:49:27,380 --> 00:49:28,780
Hey, sh... be able to...

1262
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:29,500
Hey, buddy.

1263
00:49:29,660 --> 00:49:30,900
Hit those projectiles.

1264
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:31,340
Oh!

1265
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:32,460
Fuck!

1266
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:33,300
I'm sorry!

1267
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:38,380
Worth it.

1268
00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:40,700
Worth it.

1269
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:46,140
I fucked that one guy in particular.

1270
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:47,640
Alright.

1271
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,280
I'm gonna still...

1272
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:51,820
That poor man.

1273
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:53,520
Yeah, I saw it.

1274
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:54,440
I took the chance.

1275
00:49:54,980 --> 00:49:55,600
I...

1276
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:57,260
I was like, you know what?

1277
00:49:57,660 --> 00:49:58,600
I wanna swap.

1278
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:00,660
Fuck that one guy in particular.

1279
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:02,420
Alright.

1280
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:03,500
No more flanking.

1281
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:05,720
Oh, no.

1282
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:06,980
They're gonna snowball from that.

1283
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:08,840
Woah.

1284
00:50:13,340 --> 00:50:14,680
No more flanking now.

1285
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:15,860
I think I might die, though.

1286
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:17,500
I'm pretty sure.

1287
00:50:18,820 --> 00:50:21,480
I'm pretty sure, like, he's gonna fuck me up, man.

1288
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:25,700
Oh, no.

1289
00:50:26,020 --> 00:50:26,460
No.

1290
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:26,780
Oh, no.

1291
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:27,040
Oh, no.

1292
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:28,040
We're already staggered.

1293
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:31,360
We're already staggered.

1294
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:33,140
Woah!

1295
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:37,200
What is this manga doing?

1296
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:37,700
Woah!

1297
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:38,140
Soldier!

1298
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:39,100
What the fuck are you...

1299
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:40,000
Oh, my God!

1300
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:40,980
You're still here?

1301
00:50:44,820 --> 00:50:45,480
That's it.

1302
00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:47,520
Now I'm super mad.

1303
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:50,960
Why is he still there?

1304
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:53,100
Alright.

1305
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:54,880
Oh, he went Junkrat.

1306
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:56,820
Jesus Christ.

1307
00:50:56,860 --> 00:50:57,020
Oh, my God.

1308
00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:57,380
Alright.

1309
00:50:57,940 --> 00:51:00,120
Oh, we're so staggered.

1310
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:00,380
Alright.

1311
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:00,780
We gotta...

1312
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:01,160
We gotta...

1313
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:01,320
Wait!

1314
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:02,180
We have to give...

1315
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:03,900
We gotta give the point back!

1316
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:06,300
We're so staggered now!

1317
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:08,840
Don't go up!

1318
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:14,840
Woah!

1319
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:17,280
Goodbye.

1320
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:19,440
I ain't goodbye.

1321
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:20,660
I run.

1322
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:25,880
Don't worry.

1323
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:26,320
I'm okay.

1324
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:28,380
I'm okay, guys.

1325
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:32,140
Fucking stupid.

1326
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:33,100
Oh, my God.

1327
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:42,780
I've got to kilogramast.

1328
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:47,940
I'm gonna just put the�� I'm killing this shit!

1329
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:48,700
Look at this...

1330
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:49,020
All right, What do you do?

1331
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:49,940
Wtf?

1332
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:50,580
Okay.

1333
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:52,320
I think you guys were right in the middle of that.

1334
00:51:52,540 --> 00:51:53,020
Okay.

1335
00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:53,300
Okay.

1336
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:56,320
I'm gonna stop shooting there.

1337
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:57,200
Okay.

1338
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,160
There we go.

1339
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:00,600
Okay.

1340
00:52:04,390 --> 00:52:04,940
Bye.

1341
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:09,140
Oh god, oh no, we have zero support.

1342
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:12,860
I'm heading there as fast as I can.

1343
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:19,920
Don't worry, please heal me, please Juno.

1344
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,740
Wait, where did our Juno go?

1345
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:23,700
Juno, what do you mean?

1346
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:26,700
Juno!

1347
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:29,680
Oh, now you're alive!

1348
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:31,140
Now!

1349
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:32,480
Oh shit!

1350
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:38,160
Alright, guys.

1351
00:52:39,620 --> 00:52:41,520
Guys, I don't know guys.

1352
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:48,580
Oh, even he's like GG.

1353
00:52:50,340 --> 00:52:51,340
Game over.

1354
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:54,560
One snowball is all it takes.

1355
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,420
I did so much!

1356
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:01,040
Oh, it's because I have a shitty DPS partner.

1357
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:02,320
3k?

1358
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:03,640
How?!

1359
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:05,280
I was trolling!

1360
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:08,580
How do you have less damage?!

1361
00:53:08,580 --> 00:53:09,720
I was blank!

1362
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:11,020
Okay, now I play rank.

1363
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:18,080
Now that I know how much hate I have in my life, I can play rank now.

1364
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:24,940
Now that I know that my hate is justified, I can play rank.

1365
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:26,620
And spread the hate.

1366
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:27,720
Even more.

1367
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:29,700
Alright, let me...

1368
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:33,960
Let me put something on real quick.

1369
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:36,880
Now that I'm in rank, it's time to lock it in, chat.

1370
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:40,500
Since it's rank time, it's time to lock it in.

1371
00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:41,040
It's...

1372
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:45,100
It's locked in time.

1373
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:49,720
Sorry, I had to put my contacts in.

1374
00:53:50,020 --> 00:53:50,500
I...

1375
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:56,520
I had to legally turn on my aimbot.

1376
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:59,540
I had to turn on my aimbot right now.

1377
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:00,780
We have aimbot on.

1378
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:07,040
Now that we have legal aimbot, we can check this out.

1379
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:09,680
Are they playing fucking Winston?

1380
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:11,360
Oh my god.

1381
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:12,960
Alright.

1382
00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:15,880
Alright, I know what to play now.

1383
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:22,440
What are you doing?

1384
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:24,980
Why are you on Winston?

1385
00:54:24,980 --> 00:54:27,720
Why are you on Winston?

1386
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:30,220
What do you need to improve on?

1387
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:31,740
As Winston.

1388
00:54:32,180 --> 00:54:33,580
Little bitch.

1389
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:36,420
You're part of the problem.

1390
00:54:38,180 --> 00:54:39,240
That poor...

1391
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:39,500
Whoa!

1392
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:42,660
Okay, it's alright.

1393
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:44,960
I wanted to play this character anyway.

1394
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:49,440
Alright, Cam, it's over for you.

1395
00:54:49,540 --> 00:54:51,500
You have 13 kills.

1396
00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:53,980
How long have you been here?

1397
00:54:58,960 --> 00:54:59,640
Next time.

1398
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:00,360
You did this.

1399
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:03,000
Winston?

1400
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,640
You did this, Winston.

1401
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:06,540
Just so you know.

1402
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:08,680
You did this, Winston.

1403
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:12,100
I could have been playing Cassidy.

1404
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:16,860
But you are a problem.

1405
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:19,800
Okay.

1406
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:21,620
No!

1407
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:22,640
He was one.

1408
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:24,880
Parapete.

1409
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:24,960
He was one.

1410
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:26,860
Pull up the cycle of abuse.

1411
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:28,860
Where are you, Cam?

1412
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:31,540
Where the fuck are you?

1413
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:35,420
I'm here to fuck you up, Cam.

1414
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:38,280
Oh, damn.

1415
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:39,180
It's fine.

1416
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:40,620
I gotta fuck this guy up too.

1417
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:43,720
Yeah, D.Va!

1418
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:44,340
Cringe!

1419
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:46,520
Yeah, Cam.

1420
00:55:46,780 --> 00:55:47,440
That's right.

1421
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:49,080
You did this, Cam.

1422
00:55:49,340 --> 00:55:50,640
You fucking did this.

1423
00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:52,880
I would have been happy.

1424
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:55,500
That's right.

1425
00:55:56,180 --> 00:55:57,260
What are you doing?

1426
00:55:57,540 --> 00:55:58,620
I'm on your side!

1427
00:56:00,820 --> 00:56:01,660
Fucking idiot.

1428
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:02,420
Look what you did.

1429
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:03,660
Now you're a kill for me.

1430
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:06,560
Stupid Venture.

1431
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:08,820
I'm literally on your side.

1432
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:15,440
I was literally trying to help you get rid of the monkey.

1433
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:17,800
Alright.

1434
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:19,300
Oh, he has ult for sure.

1435
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:22,920
Yep, there he goes.

1436
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:24,940
Let me farm.

1437
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:25,840
I'll farm all of you.

1438
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:28,420
I'll wait.

1439
00:56:31,340 --> 00:56:36,900
Take your aim, you idiot.

1440
00:56:38,740 --> 00:56:39,960
Oh, there we go.

1441
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:40,920
Thank you.

1442
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:41,700
Thank you.

1443
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:42,420
He's gone now.

1444
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:43,860
Oh, thank god.

1445
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:44,260
Okay.

1446
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:46,080
Now that he's gone...

1447
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:50,200
Now that he's gone, I can actually play a character.

1448
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:55,560
That's fine.

1449
00:56:55,820 --> 00:56:57,160
You must be like, really?

1450
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:58,160
D.Va?

1451
00:57:00,060 --> 00:57:00,660
Really?

1452
00:57:01,060 --> 00:57:01,380
Yes.

1453
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:05,120
Now I shall play the world of tanks.

1454
00:57:06,540 --> 00:57:09,300
Now they know what I had to go through.

1455
00:57:09,580 --> 00:57:11,180
They must be dealt.

1456
00:57:11,660 --> 00:57:15,380
They must know the pain I had to feel earlier today.

1457
00:57:23,730 --> 00:57:24,830
Yes, fuck you.

1458
00:57:24,850 --> 00:57:24,970
Right.

1459
00:57:25,010 --> 00:57:25,310
Run.

1460
00:57:25,710 --> 00:57:26,310
.

1461
00:57:26,310 --> 00:57:27,150
.

1462
00:57:30,310 --> 00:57:31,050
Cool.

1463
00:57:31,610 --> 00:57:34,390
Like D but it's...

1464
00:57:34,390 --> 00:57:34,930
.

1465
00:57:34,930 --> 00:57:36,370
.

1466
00:57:36,370 --> 00:57:37,550
.

1467
00:57:37,550 --> 00:57:39,990
He fucking left the game.

1468
00:57:40,150 --> 00:57:40,570
.

1469
00:57:43,670 --> 00:57:45,810
His bro mad.

1470
00:57:46,610 --> 00:57:47,450
.

1471
00:57:47,450 --> 00:57:49,490
.

1472
00:57:51,270 --> 00:57:56,450
I had to play against Winston in DM.

1473
00:57:58,570 --> 00:57:59,710
No!

1474
00:58:00,130 --> 00:58:01,270
No!

1475
00:58:01,430 --> 00:58:03,530
Now there's MAGA!

1476
00:58:04,070 --> 00:58:04,810
No!

1477
00:58:05,830 --> 00:58:09,510
I spit your poor soul!

1478
00:58:10,090 --> 00:58:10,950
Oh no!

1479
00:58:11,970 --> 00:58:13,750
I fucked up!

1480
00:58:14,470 --> 00:58:17,670
Now I have to play against MAGA!

1481
00:58:19,810 --> 00:58:22,010
I was gonna swap!

1482
00:58:22,370 --> 00:58:23,470
I swear!

1483
00:58:24,670 --> 00:58:26,950
I was gonna swap it!

1484
00:58:30,390 --> 00:58:32,410
This is your fault!

1485
00:58:32,850 --> 00:58:33,830
Oh yeah?

1486
00:58:35,010 --> 00:58:39,150
Now there's two MAGAs deserved!

1487
00:58:40,230 --> 00:58:42,290
What did it mean?

1488
00:58:42,410 --> 00:58:43,590
I was gonna swap!

1489
00:58:43,710 --> 00:58:45,750
Nobody killed me!

1490
00:58:51,790 --> 00:58:53,190
That's fucking right!

1491
00:58:54,310 --> 00:58:55,770
Now we all suffer!

1492
00:58:56,850 --> 00:58:59,030
Now we all suffer!

1493
00:59:01,350 --> 00:59:03,110
If you swap, I swap!

1494
00:59:04,350 --> 00:59:05,690
Oh, he left the game.

1495
00:59:05,850 --> 00:59:06,810
Okay, I'm gonna swap now.

1496
00:59:07,150 --> 00:59:08,650
I don't really need this.

1497
00:59:10,510 --> 00:59:11,030
Now...

1498
00:59:11,830 --> 00:59:13,530
Now the world is at peace.

1499
00:59:14,790 --> 00:59:16,630
The world is now at peace.

1500
00:59:21,310 --> 00:59:22,450
Oh my god!

1501
00:59:22,630 --> 00:59:23,730
Isn't that great?

1502
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:25,790
Peace has been restored!

1503
00:59:28,810 --> 00:59:29,930
I had to...

1504
00:59:29,930 --> 00:59:31,530
I had to do that!

1505
00:59:32,390 --> 00:59:34,290
For peace to be attainable!

1506
00:59:34,910 --> 00:59:35,710
What are you doing?

1507
00:59:36,510 --> 00:59:37,350
There you go!

1508
00:59:38,190 --> 00:59:38,790
Bye!

1509
00:59:40,630 --> 00:59:43,230
Where there's smoke, there's fire!

1510
00:59:43,510 --> 00:59:44,310
Alright, buddy.

1511
00:59:44,550 --> 00:59:45,070
You're good.

1512
00:59:45,130 --> 00:59:47,250
I'm gonna bully you in-game right now.

1513
00:59:51,070 --> 00:59:52,550
Bro, shoot your gun!

1514
00:59:56,430 --> 00:59:57,050
Please!

1515
00:59:59,530 --> 01:00:00,150
Oh...

1516
01:00:00,150 --> 01:00:03,650
I went through two sets of people!

1517
01:00:03,970 --> 01:00:04,670
I went through...

1518
01:00:04,670 --> 01:00:05,770
Are you fucking kidding me?

1519
01:00:05,830 --> 01:00:07,550
I went through two sets of...

1520
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,350
Two sets of people!

1521
01:00:10,090 --> 01:00:10,710
Just...

1522
01:00:10,710 --> 01:00:11,730
Give me a game!

1523
01:00:12,010 --> 01:00:12,930
Give me a game!

1524
01:00:16,010 --> 01:00:17,430
Oh my god.

1525
01:00:18,150 --> 01:00:19,610
Okay, another Juno.

1526
01:00:20,090 --> 01:00:22,350
Juno's not even the fun character for DM.

1527
01:00:22,490 --> 01:00:23,210
I don't understand.

1528
01:00:25,870 --> 01:00:26,350
Oh!

1529
01:00:26,470 --> 01:00:26,950
Oh!

1530
01:00:28,410 --> 01:00:29,270
Fucking idiot!

1531
01:00:36,110 --> 01:00:37,370
Oh, come on!

1532
01:00:38,630 --> 01:00:40,830
And now there's another- Oh, thank god I got in!

1533
01:00:44,390 --> 01:00:46,230
I was like, are you serious?

1534
01:00:48,150 --> 01:00:48,790
Alright.

1535
01:00:49,370 --> 01:00:50,410
Here we go.

1536
01:00:52,850 --> 01:00:54,010
I don't even know.

1537
01:00:54,770 --> 01:00:55,810
Juno's in-game?

1538
01:00:56,070 --> 01:00:58,210
Wait, Juno's actually in-game?

1539
01:00:58,670 --> 01:01:01,110
Wait, there's no two weeks- What?

1540
01:01:02,410 --> 01:01:03,690
No way!

1541
01:01:04,590 --> 01:01:06,850
There's no two weeks buffer period?

1542
01:01:07,590 --> 01:01:10,530
She's in- Oh god, that sounds terrible.

1543
01:01:11,370 --> 01:01:12,010
Usually.

1544
01:01:12,970 --> 01:01:15,650
Oh, I thought you meant Clash was in it!

1545
01:01:15,650 --> 01:01:17,710
They actually put Juno as well?

1546
01:01:19,030 --> 01:01:20,450
Oh my god.

1547
01:01:20,870 --> 01:01:22,550
They don't do the grace period?

1548
01:01:22,630 --> 01:01:24,550
Usually it's like two weeks of grace period.

1549
01:01:28,130 --> 01:01:28,710
Alright.

1550
01:01:30,350 --> 01:01:33,990
Usually I would prefer two weeks grace period before you put Juno in.

1551
01:01:35,990 --> 01:01:37,810
She already had the buffer period?

1552
01:01:37,910 --> 01:01:39,470
That's not even a buffer period!

1553
01:01:40,190 --> 01:01:41,930
Usually you put two weeks.

1554
01:01:42,190 --> 01:01:43,610
It's like two full weeks.

1555
01:01:43,610 --> 01:01:45,430
That was one week!

1556
01:01:47,430 --> 01:01:49,790
Yeah, but the- Oh my god, that's weird.

1557
01:01:49,850 --> 01:01:50,310
That's weird.

1558
01:01:51,170 --> 01:01:52,290
That's fucking weird.

1559
01:01:53,250 --> 01:01:54,310
I don't like that.

1560
01:01:55,650 --> 01:01:57,150
Because that means like...

1561
01:01:58,250 --> 01:02:00,070
Day one of chaos.

1562
01:02:02,250 --> 01:02:06,810
It's literally day one of fucking rank chaos.

1563
01:02:07,250 --> 01:02:08,490
Right off the bat.

1564
01:02:11,570 --> 01:02:12,530
I don't know about that.

1565
01:02:14,010 --> 01:02:21,490
On video it looks like in whole This is a lot of non-sense but seriously, Don't make a hockey show.

1566
01:02:21,710 --> 01:02:22,190
It's crazy.

1567
01:02:25,970 --> 01:02:27,410
Holy fuck man.

1568
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:28,150
Oh my god.

1569
01:02:28,150 --> 01:02:28,410
We got him.

1570
01:02:28,610 --> 01:02:29,710
He's from Canada.

1571
01:02:29,710 --> 01:02:30,530
I lovemara.

1572
01:02:30,910 --> 01:02:30,970
I love her so much.

1573
01:02:30,970 --> 01:02:31,450
Hey man.

1574
01:02:31,450 --> 01:02:34,570
We got the seal.

1575
01:02:34,570 --> 01:02:35,970
Okay you're something.

1576
01:02:35,970 --> 01:02:36,570
I saw it was the required.

1577
01:02:38,170 --> 01:02:41,370
That being said, Oh, hey!

1578
01:02:41,510 --> 01:02:42,290
He's dead though.

1579
01:02:43,410 --> 01:02:45,670
Oh, the ult charge is not that much.

1580
01:02:46,210 --> 01:02:49,110
I barely got ult charge because nobody took damage.

1581
01:02:49,910 --> 01:02:51,330
Has our Widow done anything?

1582
01:02:51,670 --> 01:02:52,390
Okay, he has.

1583
01:02:52,910 --> 01:02:53,910
That's good to know.

1584
01:02:56,990 --> 01:02:58,170
Are you serious?!

1585
01:02:58,170 --> 01:02:58,950
I didn't hit it!

1586
01:02:59,130 --> 01:03:02,690
Okay, usually that would smack somebody, but it didn't.

1587
01:03:05,450 --> 01:03:07,610
I'm just surprised it didn't smack anybody.

1588
01:03:13,220 --> 01:03:13,720
No!

1589
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:18,620
Sorry, I'm not going to pay attention to you.

1590
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:19,740
Please!

1591
01:03:28,490 --> 01:03:30,330
None of my nades hitting!

1592
01:03:32,290 --> 01:03:33,810
Everybody's getting smacked!

1593
01:03:35,210 --> 01:03:36,830
Everybody's getting smacked!

1594
01:03:37,090 --> 01:03:39,210
None of my nades are hitting!

1595
01:03:40,210 --> 01:03:42,130
You all get smacked away!

1596
01:03:45,930 --> 01:03:49,430
I have zero bionic nade kills!

1597
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:53,310
It's fine.

1598
01:03:53,470 --> 01:03:54,910
I have so much heals.

1599
01:03:57,610 --> 01:03:58,390
Smack!

1600
01:03:58,770 --> 01:04:01,130
Are you fucking kidding me?!

1601
01:04:07,190 --> 01:04:08,850
Where's my smack?!

1602
01:04:15,810 --> 01:04:16,930
I'm mad now.

1603
01:04:17,090 --> 01:04:18,190
I started the ult.

1604
01:04:18,330 --> 01:04:18,570
Okay.

1605
01:04:18,950 --> 01:04:19,590
Alright.

1606
01:04:20,790 --> 01:04:23,170
Okay, now I'm definitely whiffing.

1607
01:04:23,310 --> 01:04:25,790
Now I'm definitely whiffing.

1608
01:04:25,790 --> 01:04:26,330
For real.

1609
01:04:27,710 --> 01:04:28,930
It's happening.

1610
01:04:29,190 --> 01:04:31,710
I couldn't smack the nade.

1611
01:04:33,990 --> 01:04:35,230
What the fuck?

1612
01:04:35,390 --> 01:04:35,690
Oh.

1613
01:04:36,770 --> 01:04:37,410
Okay.

1614
01:04:38,230 --> 01:04:39,770
I saved him though.

1615
01:04:41,970 --> 01:04:43,470
Alright, it's orbit time.

1616
01:04:46,050 --> 01:04:46,690
Goodbye.

1617
01:04:47,050 --> 01:04:48,010
We leave.

1618
01:04:48,750 --> 01:04:50,230
We're gonna leave you.

1619
01:04:52,130 --> 01:04:53,010
There we go.

1620
01:04:53,170 --> 01:04:54,170
I did it!

1621
01:04:54,210 --> 01:04:54,690
I smacked!

1622
01:04:55,090 --> 01:04:57,190
Did you guys see the smack?!

1623
01:04:59,090 --> 01:05:00,230
I smacked!

1624
01:05:01,850 --> 01:05:02,490
Finally!

1625
01:05:02,490 --> 01:05:02,570
Finally!

1626
01:05:05,450 --> 01:05:06,710
I smacked.

1627
01:05:07,110 --> 01:05:08,750
That's all I wanted in life.

1628
01:05:09,110 --> 01:05:11,010
I needed the smack there.

1629
01:05:13,290 --> 01:05:13,930
Alright.

1630
01:05:14,330 --> 01:05:15,190
Hey, guys.

1631
01:05:15,350 --> 01:05:18,890
I don't feel comfortable being here by myself.

1632
01:05:21,010 --> 01:05:21,870
Hey, guys!

1633
01:05:21,930 --> 01:05:22,450
Guys!

1634
01:05:22,710 --> 01:05:22,850
Guys!

1635
01:05:23,030 --> 01:05:25,230
Where did everybody go?!

1636
01:05:25,230 --> 01:05:25,850
Hey!

1637
01:05:26,170 --> 01:05:30,230
Where did everybody go there?!

1638
01:05:30,230 --> 01:05:32,070
Guys, the cart's over here!

1639
01:05:33,050 --> 01:05:33,930
Hey, team!

1640
01:05:34,570 --> 01:05:35,010
Team!

1641
01:05:35,750 --> 01:05:36,690
Oh, we got it.

1642
01:05:36,710 --> 01:05:38,030
I'm fucking staying in the zone.

1643
01:05:39,170 --> 01:05:40,190
They don't need me.

1644
01:05:40,330 --> 01:05:42,890
By the time I walk over there, the thing will be over.

1645
01:05:44,390 --> 01:05:44,830
Taxi!

1646
01:05:45,490 --> 01:05:46,110
There we go.

1647
01:05:47,050 --> 01:05:47,490
Taxi.

1648
01:05:48,630 --> 01:05:49,070
Alright.

1649
01:05:50,450 --> 01:05:51,410
I'm back now.

1650
01:05:55,010 --> 01:05:57,570
I forgot that we had a Genji, not gonna lie.

1651
01:05:57,910 --> 01:05:59,610
I was like, oh yeah, I could do...

1652
01:06:00,070 --> 01:06:00,490
Nanoblade.

1653
01:06:02,110 --> 01:06:03,870
Winston is like really good.

1654
01:06:04,050 --> 01:06:06,090
I legitimately forgot we had a Genji.

1655
01:06:09,370 --> 01:06:09,790
Alright.

1656
01:06:12,330 --> 01:06:12,750
Okay.

1657
01:06:12,870 --> 01:06:15,330
I swear to God, if you wake him up, I will fucking cry.

1658
01:06:18,410 --> 01:06:21,510
Okay, he didn't wake him up.

1659
01:06:21,610 --> 01:06:22,150
That's good.

1660
01:06:24,830 --> 01:06:25,470
That's good.

1661
01:06:25,510 --> 01:06:26,690
He didn't wake him up.

1662
01:06:26,730 --> 01:06:27,810
That's all I care about.

1663
01:06:27,810 --> 01:06:29,730
No cries.

1664
01:06:29,850 --> 01:06:30,770
No tears today.

1665
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:37,680
Oh shit.

1666
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:38,000
Alright.

1667
01:06:38,060 --> 01:06:38,360
Goodbye.

1668
01:06:38,900 --> 01:06:39,900
Will he die?

1669
01:06:42,900 --> 01:06:43,880
He'll be fine.

1670
01:06:44,360 --> 01:06:45,860
He'll be so fine.

1671
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:48,420
Oh, never mind.

1672
01:06:48,540 --> 01:06:49,020
He's dead.

1673
01:06:51,300 --> 01:06:51,620
Oh!

1674
01:06:55,320 --> 01:06:57,180
That poor thing!

1675
01:07:01,580 --> 01:07:03,580
Oh, that was actually a misclick.

1676
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:03,980
Whoops.

1677
01:07:04,220 --> 01:07:05,360
Oh no.

1678
01:07:05,460 --> 01:07:06,280
Oh no.

1679
01:07:06,340 --> 01:07:06,580
Please.

1680
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:09,460
Please.

1681
01:07:10,100 --> 01:07:10,760
Please.

1682
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:13,940
Alright.

1683
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:16,660
He doesn't have...

1684
01:07:16,660 --> 01:07:17,420
He doesn't have...

1685
01:07:17,420 --> 01:07:18,540
Deflect!

1686
01:07:20,460 --> 01:07:21,120
No!

1687
01:07:23,380 --> 01:07:24,040
Goodbye.

1688
01:07:24,380 --> 01:07:25,200
Oh, I hit it!

1689
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:28,580
No!

1690
01:07:31,870 --> 01:07:32,790
Oh, please.

1691
01:07:32,970 --> 01:07:33,330
Please.

1692
01:07:33,370 --> 01:07:33,550
No!

1693
01:07:33,730 --> 01:07:33,790
No!

1694
01:07:33,790 --> 01:07:34,030
Oh shit!

1695
01:07:34,130 --> 01:07:34,830
Oh shit!

1696
01:07:35,150 --> 01:07:35,630
Okay.

1697
01:07:38,850 --> 01:07:39,710
Oh, I hit it!

1698
01:07:40,190 --> 01:07:41,370
Oh shit, sorry.

1699
01:07:41,490 --> 01:07:43,410
I did a 360 there, so I missed.

1700
01:07:45,130 --> 01:07:45,610
Sorry.

1701
01:07:46,450 --> 01:07:49,910
Maybe I should have done a 360 so I could have healed you, Widow.

1702
01:07:49,970 --> 01:07:51,570
That is actually my bad.

1703
01:07:51,950 --> 01:07:54,570
That is my bad.

1704
01:07:59,450 --> 01:08:00,210
Oh, Winston.

1705
01:08:00,750 --> 01:08:01,570
Oh my God.

1706
01:08:01,610 --> 01:08:03,150
They went full Winston counter.

1707
01:08:07,010 --> 01:08:10,610
Oh god, Winton.

1708
01:08:11,730 --> 01:08:12,650
Winton, please.

1709
01:08:13,030 --> 01:08:14,850
We gotta push, we're so close.

1710
01:08:16,590 --> 01:08:18,170
Oh, I got you, Juno!

1711
01:08:19,390 --> 01:08:20,410
I got you!

1712
01:08:20,510 --> 01:08:21,270
I have to walk!

1713
01:08:21,490 --> 01:08:24,330
I don't have... you all have mobility except for me!

1714
01:08:24,950 --> 01:08:26,390
I don't have mobility!

1715
01:08:32,440 --> 01:08:33,580
Is that fair?

1716
01:08:33,660 --> 01:08:34,620
You all have mobility!

1717
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:38,620
I'm just... I'm just a grandma!

1718
01:08:41,480 --> 01:08:42,980
What the fuck do I do?

1719
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:47,580
Oh, he got cleansed.

1720
01:08:47,860 --> 01:08:48,720
That's not fair, too.

1721
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:53,120
Goodbye, guys.

1722
01:08:56,080 --> 01:08:56,840
Boop him away!

1723
01:08:56,960 --> 01:08:57,460
Boop him away!

1724
01:08:58,320 --> 01:08:59,220
Boop him away!

1725
01:09:00,740 --> 01:09:01,560
Boop him away!

1726
01:09:04,620 --> 01:09:05,000
Oh no.

1727
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:06,960
Oh, we have the bubble.

1728
01:09:07,220 --> 01:09:08,160
He missed!

1729
01:09:08,380 --> 01:09:08,620
Yes!

1730
01:09:09,280 --> 01:09:09,800
Okay.

1731
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:11,220
Oh no.

1732
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:15,860
I tried.

1733
01:09:16,760 --> 01:09:17,540
Oh god.

1734
01:09:18,940 --> 01:09:20,140
Oh god, the reload.

1735
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:22,520
Winton!

1736
01:09:23,680 --> 01:09:25,880
Winton, you're so good at this game!

1737
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:28,100
Please!

1738
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:36,000
You're so good at this game, Winton!

1739
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:41,720
I don't know what's going on out there.

1740
01:09:41,860 --> 01:09:44,700
I was not... I was not ready for today.

1741
01:09:47,710 --> 01:09:49,000
Oh my god.

1742
01:09:49,860 --> 01:09:53,280
Okay, today is not a grenade day.

1743
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:58,860
Today is definitely not a grenade day.

1744
01:09:59,020 --> 01:10:03,240
I have whiffed so many nades.

1745
01:10:03,420 --> 01:10:04,660
That's crazy.

1746
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:12,640
I'm hitting shots, just not projectiles today.

1747
01:10:15,620 --> 01:10:18,300
No projectiles today for me, baby.

1748
01:10:19,020 --> 01:10:23,540
Today is just... My accuracy is pretty good.

1749
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:29,480
I'm good accuracy.

1750
01:10:30,140 --> 01:10:32,920
It's just not nade day today.

1751
01:10:33,540 --> 01:10:35,420
Like, I mean, I'm doing good heals.

1752
01:10:36,580 --> 01:10:37,300
Just aim.

1753
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:40,860
Like, I have literally the most heals out of both teams.

1754
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:45,060
I just can't... I just can't fucking throw projectiles.

1755
01:10:46,820 --> 01:10:49,400
The nades are... The nades are in problem.

1756
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:50,240
They are.

1757
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:53,760
The nades are actually not good.

1758
01:10:55,820 --> 01:10:59,900
Okay, I just want to make sure I'm 280 hertz because sometimes it resets itself for no reason.

1759
01:11:03,540 --> 01:11:05,280
Oh, they went mora.

1760
01:11:05,300 --> 01:11:05,980
That's what I do.

1761
01:11:05,980 --> 01:11:09,000
There's a good Winston and I don't trust my team at all.

1762
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:12,060
I just be like, fuck it.

1763
01:11:15,380 --> 01:11:17,220
All right, that definitely hit somebody.

1764
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:18,940
I know that for sure.

1765
01:11:19,060 --> 01:11:19,680
Oh, shit.

1766
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:24,380
Oh, god.

1767
01:11:24,580 --> 01:11:26,300
Bro, we're trying.

1768
01:11:27,420 --> 01:11:29,640
No, he threw a fucking wall.

1769
01:11:34,590 --> 01:11:35,490
Come back.

1770
01:11:35,530 --> 01:11:36,570
We need your help.

1771
01:11:36,650 --> 01:11:37,030
Winston.

1772
01:11:37,030 --> 01:11:37,630
Winston!

1773
01:11:38,770 --> 01:11:39,330
Winston!

1774
01:11:43,910 --> 01:11:45,350
Oh, they're all anti!

1775
01:11:45,670 --> 01:11:46,770
They'll make an anti!

1776
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:51,820
Oh, shit!

1777
01:11:53,820 --> 01:11:54,940
Juno, you and I.

1778
01:11:55,260 --> 01:11:56,140
You and I.

1779
01:11:56,200 --> 01:11:56,720
We heal each other!

1780
01:11:56,820 --> 01:11:57,080
Juno!

1781
01:11:57,380 --> 01:12:00,420
I thought we made a deal, you and I!

1782
01:12:03,680 --> 01:12:04,420
Juno please.

1783
01:12:04,740 --> 01:12:05,840
You and I.

1784
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:08,740
I thought we made a

1785
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:15,320
Winston literally just got ulted too!

1786
01:12:15,580 --> 01:12:16,260
That sucks!

1787
01:12:16,820 --> 01:12:18,100
Alright, I'm gonna go Kiriko.

1788
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:21,720
I hate playing Ana against a Sigma.

1789
01:12:26,940 --> 01:12:27,580
Alright.

1790
01:12:28,620 --> 01:12:30,400
Oh shit, what the fuck?

1791
01:12:32,620 --> 01:12:33,380
Use Symmetra.

1792
01:12:36,950 --> 01:12:37,590
Alright.

1793
01:12:38,210 --> 01:12:38,990
That's fine.

1794
01:12:41,870 --> 01:12:43,970
Oh god, you were in the sky!

1795
01:12:44,270 --> 01:12:45,670
I have to learn to look up!

1796
01:12:45,670 --> 01:12:48,910
I don't know if I'm ready for that commitment yet.

1797
01:12:53,390 --> 01:12:54,710
I don't know.

1798
01:12:57,490 --> 01:12:57,870
No!

1799
01:12:59,910 --> 01:13:00,670
This!

1800
01:13:00,790 --> 01:13:01,310
Winston!

1801
01:13:01,950 --> 01:13:02,330
Winston,

1802
01:13:05,710 --> 01:13:07,230
why didn't you beat me?

1803
01:13:07,490 --> 01:13:10,110
I just wanted to nano you!

1804
01:13:11,350 --> 01:13:12,110
Winston!

1805
01:13:12,770 --> 01:13:16,410
I just wanted to look at you!

1806
01:13:19,190 --> 01:13:19,710
Please!

1807
01:13:22,590 --> 01:13:24,950
You didn't look at us!

1808
01:13:25,790 --> 01:13:26,310
Winston!

1809
01:13:30,170 --> 01:13:33,590
Okay, I'm gonna stay near the Winston so I can fucking...

1810
01:13:33,590 --> 01:13:34,810
Alright, Winston.

1811
01:13:34,890 --> 01:13:35,670
Winston, please.

1812
01:13:36,210 --> 01:13:37,390
Winston, please.

1813
01:13:38,130 --> 01:13:42,390
I'm gonna do this and then you're gonna do whatever the fuck you do there.

1814
01:13:46,430 --> 01:13:47,410
Alright, nice.

1815
01:13:47,530 --> 01:13:49,410
I don't think he's doing much with it.

1816
01:13:52,690 --> 01:13:54,270
Oh, I hear a Ventress.

1817
01:13:54,310 --> 01:13:54,990
Oh, he killed!

1818
01:13:57,090 --> 01:13:57,750
That's us!

1819
01:13:59,010 --> 01:14:00,950
Oh, that's a lot of ults, guys.

1820
01:14:01,090 --> 01:14:01,810
I don't know.

1821
01:14:02,170 --> 01:14:05,070
That seems a little overkill, guys.

1822
01:14:08,590 --> 01:14:10,650
That seems a little overkill.

1823
01:14:10,850 --> 01:14:11,830
We used like...

1824
01:14:11,830 --> 01:14:12,930
Oh, all of it.

1825
01:14:12,990 --> 01:14:13,230
Okay.

1826
01:14:13,650 --> 01:14:14,130
Alright.

1827
01:14:16,570 --> 01:14:17,890
Alright, all of it.

1828
01:14:17,990 --> 01:14:18,730
That's fine.

1829
01:14:18,850 --> 01:14:19,430
That's fine.

1830
01:14:19,430 --> 01:14:21,570
We didn't need our ults.

1831
01:14:23,290 --> 01:14:24,070
I hear.

1832
01:14:28,050 --> 01:14:28,530
Alright.

1833
01:14:28,650 --> 01:14:30,810
I'm about to get shot in the back.

1834
01:14:31,030 --> 01:14:31,790
I can feel it.

1835
01:14:34,150 --> 01:14:34,950
Oh, shit!

1836
01:14:35,050 --> 01:14:35,710
I did that!

1837
01:14:40,180 --> 01:14:40,660
See?

1838
01:14:40,820 --> 01:14:41,060
Look!

1839
01:14:41,260 --> 01:14:42,200
I can hit that!

1840
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:45,160
I did that!

1841
01:14:46,620 --> 01:14:47,420
Oh, my god.

1842
01:14:47,460 --> 01:14:48,140
I did that.

1843
01:14:48,340 --> 01:14:48,820
Smashed.

1844
01:14:48,820 --> 01:14:49,520
I did that.

1845
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:49,660
Yippee!

1846
01:14:50,820 --> 01:14:51,480
Yeah!

1847
01:14:52,720 --> 01:14:53,380
Yeah!

1848
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:55,400
Get it down, grandma!

1849
01:14:55,840 --> 01:14:57,580
Let's fucking go, granny.

1850
01:15:01,720 --> 01:15:04,000
Show your asses, granny!

1851
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:07,440
Is there a Mr. Anna?

1852
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:10,460
Dude, he woke up.

1853
01:15:11,700 --> 01:15:12,360
Alright.

1854
01:15:14,590 --> 01:15:15,520
It'll be fine, right?

1855
01:15:16,340 --> 01:15:17,400
It'll be fine.

1856
01:15:18,980 --> 01:15:20,080
What are the moves?

1857
01:15:22,620 --> 01:15:23,540
A reaper?

1858
01:15:23,780 --> 01:15:26,020
Oh, they went for another reaper counter.

1859
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:27,960
See?

1860
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:28,880
Oh, they went hog.

1861
01:15:29,180 --> 01:15:29,640
Oh ho ho.

1862
01:15:30,140 --> 01:15:30,740
Angy.

1863
01:15:31,780 --> 01:15:34,600
Please, Symmetra.

1864
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:37,820
He's so angy.

1865
01:15:37,980 --> 01:15:42,040
They went full fucking Winston counter.

1866
01:15:42,340 --> 01:15:44,380
I'm actually getting carried by this Winston.

1867
01:15:44,720 --> 01:15:45,740
Holy shit.

1868
01:15:46,020 --> 01:15:47,280
I'm gonna send a friend request.

1869
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:52,380
Wait, do I?

1870
01:15:56,080 --> 01:15:58,140
That Winston is gaming.

1871
01:16:04,910 --> 01:16:06,670
Wait, where is he?

1872
01:16:12,290 --> 01:16:13,030
Whoops.

1873
01:16:13,030 --> 01:16:13,950
It's alright.

1874
01:16:14,330 --> 01:16:15,650
I didn't know you- oh.

1875
01:16:16,130 --> 01:16:17,590
That is not okay.

1876
01:16:17,870 --> 01:16:20,050
That is not okay right now.

1877
01:16:22,390 --> 01:16:22,970
Oh, that poor Ashe.

1878
01:16:23,230 --> 01:16:24,690
That poor fucking Ashe.

1879
01:16:25,970 --> 01:16:26,630
Holy...

1880
01:16:29,180 --> 01:16:30,170
That Ashe...

1881
01:16:30,170 --> 01:16:32,450
Oh shit, poor me.

1882
01:16:33,390 --> 01:16:34,830
Oh shit, okay.

1883
01:16:35,270 --> 01:16:36,570
Why did you wake him?

1884
01:16:36,670 --> 01:16:37,290
Okay, alright.

1885
01:16:37,530 --> 01:16:38,210
That's fine.

1886
01:16:41,470 --> 01:16:42,330
That's fine.

1887
01:16:42,730 --> 01:16:44,230
You have a...

1888
01:16:47,690 --> 01:16:48,590
That's okay.

1889
01:16:49,850 --> 01:16:50,770
That's okay.

1890
01:16:51,090 --> 01:16:52,450
Everything is okay.

1891
01:16:53,950 --> 01:16:55,050
Alright, nice.

1892
01:16:55,270 --> 01:16:57,030
One more minute of health.

1893
01:17:00,520 --> 01:17:01,520
Oh ho.

1894
01:17:01,880 --> 01:17:04,360
Oh ho, he definitely wants to ult.

1895
01:17:06,060 --> 01:17:07,100
There you go.

1896
01:17:10,050 --> 01:17:14,740
I knew... I knew I was fucking... I knew there was no hope.

1897
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:16,160
I could tell.

1898
01:17:16,360 --> 01:17:18,800
I saw the Reaper rolling in.

1899
01:17:18,980 --> 01:17:22,820
And then I saw the entire team W keying into us.

1900
01:17:22,820 --> 01:17:25,180
And I was just like, alright, I'm out.

1901
01:17:26,020 --> 01:17:26,800
I'm out.

1902
01:17:29,380 --> 01:17:31,340
Oh, that AD spam though.

1903
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:33,460
Alright, you should have walked backwards.

1904
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:34,520
Like, through...

1905
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:36,700
I... I don't know what he wanted.

1906
01:17:37,580 --> 01:17:38,100
Clearly.

1907
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:41,640
I don't know why he didn't walk backwards there.

1908
01:17:41,880 --> 01:17:44,040
And kept fucking ADing.

1909
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:45,560
Oh god.

1910
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:47,460
Oh god, he's looking for the hook.

1911
01:17:51,020 --> 01:17:52,880
Oh god, he's looking for the hook.

1912
01:17:54,640 --> 01:17:55,520
Oh god.

1913
01:17:57,780 --> 01:17:59,200
Alright, we're back in it.

1914
01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:02,260
Oh, please don't smack him into me!

1915
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:06,740
I saw... I saw the red!

1916
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:09,920
I saw the red in my life flashed!

1917
01:18:11,620 --> 01:18:15,360
I saw the... the flying Cassidy!

1918
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:17,700
Holy shit!

1919
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,620
Not the fucking flying Cassidy!

1920
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:26,320
Oh my god, I thought it was over for me.

1921
01:18:28,160 --> 01:18:29,140
It was.

1922
01:18:35,860 --> 01:18:38,600
Guys, joke's on me, it was over for me.

1923
01:18:38,820 --> 01:18:40,420
It was over.

1924
01:18:41,060 --> 01:18:43,060
Oh my god, who would've thought?

1925
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:48,040
Who would've thought it was over?

1926
01:18:48,920 --> 01:18:49,940
Okay, it went good.

1927
01:18:50,300 --> 01:18:51,200
We play for nano here, okay?

1928
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:51,880
Okay.

1929
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:00,760
Goodbye.

1930
01:19:04,920 --> 01:19:08,900
Guys, none of us touched point.

1931
01:19:08,980 --> 01:19:11,400
Guys, why did none of us touch point?

1932
01:19:11,660 --> 01:19:12,560
I got hooked!

1933
01:19:12,780 --> 01:19:13,840
I had an excuse!

1934
01:19:14,540 --> 01:19:15,060
I...

1935
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:20,180
I... I literally got hooked!

1936
01:19:20,380 --> 01:19:21,860
What do you want me to do?

1937
01:19:22,180 --> 01:19:28,820
I... I don't know what they wanted me to do.

1938
01:19:28,900 --> 01:19:30,320
I got fucking hooked, man.

1939
01:19:30,540 --> 01:19:31,660
I... I...

1940
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:36,020
I can't believe we see that.

1941
01:19:36,360 --> 01:19:40,480
I can't believe that our Winston is so fucking good.

1942
01:19:40,720 --> 01:19:44,200
And we actually probably had 21 games.

1943
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:45,800
21 game damage!

1944
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:49,280
Bro, what is our team doing?

1945
01:19:53,180 --> 01:19:54,840
Okay, I'm gonna go cute.

1946
01:19:56,480 --> 01:19:59,660
The thing is, if they go... I need to go Ana.

1947
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:02,160
If they go hard, I have to play Ana.

1948
01:20:02,260 --> 01:20:02,780
Sad.

1949
01:20:08,740 --> 01:20:10,180
They have a hog again.

1950
01:20:13,580 --> 01:20:14,620
Holy shit.

1951
01:20:14,620 --> 01:20:16,460
Why is this my first game?

1952
01:20:16,900 --> 01:20:18,060
Why the fuck?

1953
01:20:20,440 --> 01:20:21,560
Like, what the fuck?

1954
01:20:21,880 --> 01:20:24,120
Our DPS also got really stag...

1955
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:27,980
Like, our... their... their DPS is not doing so well.

1956
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:30,760
But we got hella staggered and we're fucking around too much.

1957
01:20:31,900 --> 01:20:34,520
Our DPS was definitely fucking around too much earlier.

1958
01:20:35,380 --> 01:20:39,180
I feel like the moment they shut down our hog, it's over for our team.

1959
01:20:40,160 --> 01:20:42,460
We were relying too much on him.

1960
01:20:46,780 --> 01:20:47,840
Oh my god, please.

1961
01:20:47,900 --> 01:20:48,620
I had to...

1962
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:50,960
I had to heal so many other people.

1963
01:20:55,320 --> 01:20:56,120
Oh god.

1964
01:20:56,720 --> 01:20:58,440
I have to reload, bro.

1965
01:21:01,480 --> 01:21:01,940
Okay.

1966
01:21:06,610 --> 01:21:07,310
That's fine.

1967
01:21:07,870 --> 01:21:08,610
That's fine.

1968
01:21:09,790 --> 01:21:10,490
That's fine.

1969
01:21:10,570 --> 01:21:11,710
That was a huge anti.

1970
01:21:13,690 --> 01:21:14,750
I have to reload.

1971
01:21:18,510 --> 01:21:18,950
There you go.

1972
01:21:19,290 --> 01:21:20,230
Oh, no!

1973
01:21:21,230 --> 01:21:21,830
I'm sorry!

1974
01:21:31,770 --> 01:21:32,850
That's actually...

1975
01:21:32,850 --> 01:21:33,530
Oh shit.

1976
01:21:33,630 --> 01:21:34,550
That's crazy.

1977
01:21:42,160 --> 01:21:43,360
Please get rid of him.

1978
01:21:43,720 --> 01:21:44,320
Please.

1979
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:46,600
Please get rid of the Reaper.

1980
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:49,760
He jumped!

1981
01:21:50,240 --> 01:21:50,380
Oh!

1982
01:21:52,580 --> 01:21:53,700
He actually...

1983
01:21:53,700 --> 01:21:56,340
Oh my god!

1984
01:22:04,730 --> 01:22:05,610
Oh no.

1985
01:22:05,770 --> 01:22:06,630
No, no, no.

1986
01:22:08,930 --> 01:22:11,210
Ashe, I'm gonna keep you up, but then...

1987
01:22:11,210 --> 01:22:12,710
You still don't have ult, Ashe?

1988
01:22:13,010 --> 01:22:14,290
How do you not have ult?

1989
01:22:14,550 --> 01:22:15,410
How do you...

1990
01:22:15,410 --> 01:22:18,250
How do you not have ult, Ashe?

1991
01:22:18,810 --> 01:22:20,870
Our Symmetra had ult!

1992
01:22:21,370 --> 01:22:22,290
How did he...

1993
01:22:22,290 --> 01:22:23,070
Oh, it's over.

1994
01:22:23,410 --> 01:22:25,210
Our Ashe did not have ult.

1995
01:22:25,390 --> 01:22:26,530
It's actually...

1996
01:22:26,530 --> 01:22:27,590
Oh my god.

1997
01:22:28,130 --> 01:22:30,570
No, I can't even swap.

1998
01:22:31,590 --> 01:22:33,730
I can't believe it.

1999
01:22:33,830 --> 01:22:35,490
He does not have ult.

2000
01:22:36,150 --> 01:22:36,990
How?

2001
01:22:39,470 --> 01:22:40,270
Oh, no.

2002
01:22:42,270 --> 01:22:44,850
I am just very surprised.

2003
01:22:50,570 --> 01:22:54,350
Out of everybody you expect to have...

2004
01:22:54,350 --> 01:22:55,950
Oh, I have to reload.

2005
01:22:56,110 --> 01:22:57,010
I'm sorry.

2006
01:22:57,010 --> 01:22:58,450
Sorry, our Juno didn't heal.

2007
01:23:02,290 --> 01:23:03,550
I had to...

2008
01:23:03,550 --> 01:23:05,130
Alright, he still doesn't have ult!

2009
01:23:08,950 --> 01:23:10,590
Oh my god!

2010
01:23:11,250 --> 01:23:12,950
What a full game!

2011
01:23:13,410 --> 01:23:14,290
We had to...

2012
01:23:14,290 --> 01:23:15,590
Holy shit!

2013
01:23:15,930 --> 01:23:17,950
He still doesn't have ult!

2014
01:23:18,630 --> 01:23:19,630
That's crazy!

2015
01:23:20,210 --> 01:23:22,570
How do you steal that ult after all of that?

2016
01:23:27,890 --> 01:23:29,230
Oh my god!

2017
01:23:29,350 --> 01:23:31,890
His ult was passively charged!

2018
01:23:32,410 --> 01:23:33,650
There's no way!

2019
01:23:34,030 --> 01:23:37,970
There's no way you don't have ult after all those games!

2020
01:23:40,750 --> 01:23:43,090
What is that Ashe doing?

2021
01:23:46,870 --> 01:23:48,870
Oh my god!

2022
01:23:49,150 --> 01:23:52,710
What the fuck is her fucking Ashe doing?

2023
01:23:54,850 --> 01:23:56,390
Spooks, thank you for...

2024
01:23:57,010 --> 01:23:58,890
joining the Tome of Fire!

2025
01:23:58,970 --> 01:23:59,470
Welcome back!

2026
01:24:00,250 --> 01:24:01,330
Happy birthday to you!

2027
01:24:01,470 --> 01:24:02,990
Happy birthday to you!

2028
01:24:03,110 --> 01:24:06,650
Happy birthday dear Spooks!

2029
01:24:06,670 --> 01:24:07,890
Happy birthday to you!

2030
01:24:07,970 --> 01:24:08,210
Yeah!

2031
01:24:08,690 --> 01:24:13,270
This Ashe still has no ult.

2032
01:24:13,330 --> 01:24:14,830
I cannot believe it.

2033
01:24:14,930 --> 01:24:16,430
It's actually...

2034
01:24:19,530 --> 01:24:24,110
I can't believe this Ashe still doesn't have fucking ult.

2035
01:24:27,010 --> 01:24:27,250
Bro!

2036
01:24:27,310 --> 01:24:29,170
Okay, he's not playing Ashe anymore.

2037
01:24:31,050 --> 01:24:33,090
He's playing Genji now.

2038
01:24:33,470 --> 01:24:38,130
Bro, I think he's more of a Genji player than an Ashe player.

2039
01:24:38,290 --> 01:24:38,990
That's for sure.

2040
01:24:41,510 --> 01:24:42,090
Alright.

2041
01:24:46,130 --> 01:24:47,350
I'm just gonna push.

2042
01:24:48,030 --> 01:24:49,230
We got the pick.

2043
01:24:57,420 --> 01:24:58,000
Alright.

2044
01:25:00,180 --> 01:25:00,760
Please.

2045
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:02,380
Don't let him kill me.

2046
01:25:03,220 --> 01:25:03,800
Alright.

2047
01:25:03,960 --> 01:25:05,800
I mean, they have another fight from that.

2048
01:25:07,140 --> 01:25:09,180
So, it's not bad for them.

2049
01:25:09,420 --> 01:25:10,540
The Reaper's gonna...

2050
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:13,960
Kill the Reaper.

2051
01:25:14,760 --> 01:25:16,400
Kill the Reaper.

2052
01:25:17,520 --> 01:25:18,840
But like, don't die.

2053
01:25:19,160 --> 01:25:20,040
Genji, please.

2054
01:25:20,760 --> 01:25:23,160
Genji, I literally have no angle.

2055
01:25:23,980 --> 01:25:25,020
He lives?

2056
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:27,020
Oh, they went Winston.

2057
01:25:32,500 --> 01:25:33,320
Oh no.

2058
01:25:33,320 --> 01:25:33,360
Oh no.

2059
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:38,640
No supports.

2060
01:25:43,380 --> 01:25:45,300
I'm trying!

2061
01:25:45,920 --> 01:25:47,380
I tried!

2062
01:25:48,520 --> 01:25:49,480
Nearly!

2063
01:25:49,780 --> 01:25:50,660
I hit you!

2064
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:53,200
Oh my god!

2065
01:25:53,500 --> 01:25:54,700
I touched!

2066
01:25:54,840 --> 01:25:55,680
I did!

2067
01:25:56,120 --> 01:26:01,320
You just kept getting shot at!

2068
01:26:04,220 --> 01:26:05,180
Okay.

2069
01:26:05,240 --> 01:26:05,720
Okay.

2070
01:26:05,740 --> 01:26:05,940
Why not?

2071
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:07,440
Reaper

2072
01:26:12,360 --> 01:26:12,600
1!

2073
01:26:13,180 --> 01:26:13,480
Okay.

2074
01:26:16,600 --> 01:26:17,240
Please.

2075
01:26:17,500 --> 01:26:18,500
Keep me up.

2076
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:18,800
Please.

2077
01:26:19,100 --> 01:26:20,100
That's all I want.

2078
01:26:20,300 --> 01:26:21,140
Thank you.

2079
01:26:25,320 --> 01:26:25,960
Alright.

2080
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:27,040
Oh!

2081
01:26:31,330 --> 01:26:31,970
No!

2082
01:26:32,110 --> 01:26:32,570
No!

2083
01:26:32,650 --> 01:26:33,830
Why didn't you wait yet?!

2084
01:26:38,050 --> 01:26:39,830
Oh my god!

2085
01:26:40,110 --> 01:26:40,610
Jesus!

2086
01:26:40,610 --> 01:26:42,170
That Tracer!

2087
01:26:45,670 --> 01:26:49,370
That Tracer actually woke him up!

2088
01:26:49,730 --> 01:26:50,470
I...

2089
01:26:50,470 --> 01:26:52,990
I hate my...

2090
01:26:52,990 --> 01:26:55,350
I hate my DPS.

2091
01:26:55,710 --> 01:26:57,990
I actually hate my DPS.

2092
01:26:58,510 --> 01:27:00,590
I don't want them ever.

2093
01:27:00,850 --> 01:27:02,250
I don't...

2094
01:27:02,250 --> 01:27:05,390
I don't want them ever on my team again.

2095
01:27:05,770 --> 01:27:07,370
There was zero.

2096
01:27:08,330 --> 01:27:08,970
Oh my.

2097
01:27:09,050 --> 01:27:10,110
I would have lived!

2098
01:27:10,610 --> 01:27:11,670
That's the thing!

2099
01:27:12,010 --> 01:27:12,570
No.

2100
01:27:12,650 --> 01:27:14,150
Fuck the other DPS too.

2101
01:27:14,310 --> 01:27:16,050
Who the fuck is this guy?

2102
01:27:16,110 --> 01:27:17,290
This guy was crazy.

2103
01:27:17,890 --> 01:27:21,890
I'm fucking sending a friend request and being like...

2104
01:27:25,730 --> 01:27:27,190
Oh my god.

2105
01:27:27,290 --> 01:27:27,770
I can't.

2106
01:27:27,830 --> 01:27:28,430
I'm gonna get insurance.

2107
01:27:28,790 --> 01:27:30,550
I'm fucking getting insurance right now.

2108
01:27:35,150 --> 01:27:36,270
I can't.

2109
01:27:36,270 --> 01:27:38,630
I can't fuck after that game.

2110
01:27:38,910 --> 01:27:40,270
Holy shit.

2111
01:27:40,610 --> 01:27:41,050
I...

2112
01:27:43,310 --> 01:27:45,270
I'm so...

2113
01:27:45,270 --> 01:27:47,470
I'm so fucking mad.

2114
01:27:47,690 --> 01:27:49,090
Holy shit.

2115
01:27:49,370 --> 01:27:52,150
I can't believe that happened!

2116
01:27:52,790 --> 01:27:53,430
I...

2117
01:27:54,310 --> 01:27:54,950
Sorry.

2118
01:27:56,830 --> 01:27:58,110
That...

2119
01:27:58,110 --> 01:27:59,690
If...

2120
01:28:09,450 --> 01:28:10,750
I'm just saying...

2121
01:28:10,750 --> 01:28:12,630
I'm just saying...

2122
01:28:14,890 --> 01:28:15,970
If like...

2123
01:28:16,330 --> 01:28:17,470
Oh my god.

2124
01:28:17,730 --> 01:28:19,750
If they didn't wake up the D.Va!

2125
01:28:20,110 --> 01:28:26,670
If they actually woke up the D.Va we actually could have got this.

2126
01:28:26,730 --> 01:28:28,190
I'm so fucking mad.

2127
01:28:28,570 --> 01:28:29,290
I...

2128
01:28:29,690 --> 01:28:31,550
Our Winston did so much.

2129
01:28:31,590 --> 01:28:33,410
I feel so bad for him.

2130
01:28:33,550 --> 01:28:35,230
He did so much.

2131
01:28:35,590 --> 01:28:37,750
And then this is the team we got.

2132
01:28:40,290 --> 01:28:42,970
I didn't even get Bob!

2133
01:28:43,850 --> 01:28:45,730
How do you not have Bob?

2134
01:28:52,210 --> 01:28:55,290
At any point of their lives.

2135
01:28:55,750 --> 01:28:59,090
At any fucking point of their lives.

2136
01:28:59,690 --> 01:29:00,490
We did not...

2137
01:29:00,490 --> 01:29:02,250
He did not deserve that.

2138
01:29:02,530 --> 01:29:03,170
He...

2139
01:29:03,170 --> 01:29:07,450
He did not deserve that.

2140
01:29:07,790 --> 01:29:09,270
Oh my god.

2141
01:29:11,770 --> 01:29:14,410
I think I'm gonna add somebody real quick.

2142
01:29:20,550 --> 01:29:22,610
Oh my god.

2143
01:29:22,630 --> 01:29:23,490
I need insurance.

2144
01:29:23,870 --> 01:29:24,710
I need...

2145
01:29:24,710 --> 01:29:27,610
I can't.

2146
01:29:27,610 --> 01:29:28,390
After...

2147
01:29:28,390 --> 01:29:30,990
After everything that happened I need a...

2148
01:29:30,990 --> 01:29:34,230
I need fucking insurance right now.

2149
01:29:34,690 --> 01:29:37,390
Usually I'm okay with solo queueing.

2150
01:29:37,470 --> 01:29:38,550
But that game...

2151
01:29:38,550 --> 01:29:40,530
That game fucking...

2152
01:29:40,530 --> 01:29:41,290
Oh my god.

2153
01:29:41,310 --> 01:29:42,670
That game tilted me so hard.

2154
01:29:43,130 --> 01:29:44,530
I fucking...

2155
01:29:44,530 --> 01:29:46,290
That was a 30 plus minute game.

2156
01:29:46,530 --> 01:29:48,010
That was actually a...

2157
01:29:48,010 --> 01:29:51,670
That was actually a 30 minute plus game.

2158
01:29:51,870 --> 01:29:53,830
Just for that to happen.

2159
01:29:54,110 --> 01:29:55,530
Oh my god.

2160
01:29:55,530 --> 01:29:57,530
I'm gonna fucking...

2161
01:29:58,870 --> 01:29:59,550
Oh...

2162
01:29:59,550 --> 01:30:00,550
This is...

2163
01:30:00,550 --> 01:30:02,030
This is a toxic relationship.

2164
01:30:02,310 --> 01:30:04,610
This is a toxic relationship with Overwatch.

2165
01:30:05,470 --> 01:30:06,150
I...

2166
01:30:15,440 --> 01:30:17,420
Let the hate flow.

2167
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:18,780
That's basically it.

2168
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:21,680
I'm letting the hate fucking flow into me right now.

2169
01:30:22,320 --> 01:30:23,740
Next game.

2170
01:30:23,940 --> 01:30:25,320
Next game guys.

2171
01:30:25,540 --> 01:30:27,840
Surely next game won't be that bad.

2172
01:30:28,240 --> 01:30:28,600
Oh yeah.

2173
01:30:29,340 --> 01:30:30,220
Surely like...

2174
01:30:30,220 --> 01:30:31,480
Next game will be okay.

2175
01:30:34,340 --> 01:30:35,420
And it's like...

2176
01:30:35,420 --> 01:30:36,760
It was not okay.

2177
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:45,120
Oh my god.

2178
01:30:49,640 --> 01:30:51,440
Hey Doki, did you see Deadlock?

2179
01:30:51,500 --> 01:30:54,500
How much toxicity do you think he'd come from a FPS MOBA?

2180
01:30:54,620 --> 01:30:55,620
Skylam, thank you for the super chat.

2181
01:30:55,680 --> 01:30:55,960
Thank you.

2182
01:30:58,600 --> 01:30:59,420
Not say anything.

2183
01:31:09,740 --> 01:31:10,260
Deadlock?

2184
01:31:10,340 --> 01:31:10,720
What's that?

2185
01:31:15,640 --> 01:31:16,680
What's Deadlock?

2186
01:31:25,890 --> 01:31:27,210
Never heard of it.

2187
01:31:27,290 --> 01:31:28,650
Never heard of it before.

2188
01:31:31,070 --> 01:31:31,710
Alright.

2189
01:31:32,210 --> 01:31:33,650
It's insurance time.

2190
01:31:38,870 --> 01:31:39,990
Here we go.

2191
01:31:46,080 --> 01:31:46,720
Alright.

2192
01:31:46,900 --> 01:31:48,680
We have rank insurance.

2193
01:31:49,800 --> 01:31:52,340
We have rank insurance.

2194
01:31:55,800 --> 01:31:56,860
Oh my god.

2195
01:31:56,900 --> 01:31:57,540
I wish...

2196
01:31:57,820 --> 01:32:00,600
Guys, I don't think that Winston wants to be my friend.

2197
01:32:00,740 --> 01:32:01,380
I don't...

2198
01:32:01,860 --> 01:32:05,320
I don't think that Winston wants to be my friend.

2199
01:32:05,400 --> 01:32:05,820
Guys.

2200
01:32:06,480 --> 01:32:07,060
Guys.

2201
01:32:10,400 --> 01:32:11,540
I'm so sad.

2202
01:32:12,180 --> 01:32:13,300
I don't know why.

2203
01:32:13,500 --> 01:32:15,200
Why don't they want to be my friend?

2204
01:32:16,700 --> 01:32:17,940
Bro, what the fuck?

2205
01:32:18,140 --> 01:32:19,260
Why is this all?

2206
01:32:19,300 --> 01:32:20,340
This is Space Battle.

2207
01:32:20,660 --> 01:32:22,360
This is fucking Star Wars.

2208
01:32:22,860 --> 01:32:25,080
But like...

2209
01:32:25,080 --> 01:32:27,220
Post Disney Star Wars.

2210
01:32:27,720 --> 01:32:28,240
Fuck it.

2211
01:32:28,260 --> 01:32:29,960
I'm fucking going into Space Battle time.

2212
01:32:30,860 --> 01:32:32,340
Space Battle time.

2213
01:32:32,340 --> 01:32:33,780
That's fucking... what are you gonna do with that?

2214
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:34,300
Nothing!

2215
01:32:34,760 --> 01:32:36,700
Oh, you got super shit!

2216
01:32:36,840 --> 01:32:37,540
That's fucking right!

2217
01:32:38,780 --> 01:32:39,740
That's embarrassing!

2218
01:32:39,940 --> 01:32:41,380
Oh no, that's embarrassing for me.

2219
01:32:42,260 --> 01:32:42,740
JKA.

2220
01:32:46,680 --> 01:32:47,640
Jesus Christ.

2221
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:51,480
Whoa!

2222
01:32:52,040 --> 01:32:52,520
Yeah?

2223
01:32:53,480 --> 01:32:54,860
Yeah, I fucking see you!

2224
01:32:55,320 --> 01:32:56,420
That's fucking right!

2225
01:32:56,500 --> 01:32:57,280
Where are you?

2226
01:32:58,320 --> 01:33:00,200
You wanna... do it with me too?

2227
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:03,960
Oh, that's fucking...

2228
01:33:03,960 --> 01:33:04,220
Yeah!

2229
01:33:04,500 --> 01:33:05,120
Hey!

2230
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:06,660
Oh shit!

2231
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:07,080
Okay!

2232
01:33:07,630 --> 01:33:08,220
Never mind.

2233
01:33:08,620 --> 01:33:09,240
Never...

2234
01:33:10,590 --> 01:33:11,460
Never mind.

2235
01:33:12,020 --> 01:33:14,360
He actually hit his first shots.

2236
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:15,420
Isn't that crazy?

2237
01:33:16,130 --> 01:33:17,480
He actually did it.

2238
01:33:19,550 --> 01:33:20,360
Good for him.

2239
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:22,160
Good for him.

2240
01:33:23,580 --> 01:33:24,720
Good for him.

2241
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:26,460
Who fucking is playing Cassidy?

2242
01:33:26,940 --> 01:33:28,660
In the Space Wars!

2243
01:33:30,040 --> 01:33:32,160
In the fucking Space Wars!

2244
01:33:32,560 --> 01:33:33,840
What are you doing?

2245
01:33:35,480 --> 01:33:36,660
This team will buy you!

2246
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:44,600
The last remaining non-Disney IP.

2247
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:46,960
It's Cowboys vs.

2248
01:33:47,300 --> 01:33:48,180
Aliens.

2249
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:50,720
On solo lore accurate.

2250
01:33:51,500 --> 01:33:52,800
Holy fuck.

2251
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:55,760
Holy fuck.

2252
01:33:57,760 --> 01:33:58,540
Here we go.

2253
01:34:00,980 --> 01:34:02,540
Oh, he's not Widow anymore.

2254
01:34:02,800 --> 01:34:03,700
Oh, that is...

2255
01:34:04,490 --> 01:34:06,080
That is so embarrassing.

2256
01:34:06,140 --> 01:34:06,740
Oh, fuck!

2257
01:34:07,240 --> 01:34:07,820
What?

2258
01:34:09,580 --> 01:34:10,160
Alright.

2259
01:34:13,160 --> 01:34:13,740
What?

2260
01:34:13,820 --> 01:34:15,400
Now everybody's Cassidy?

2261
01:34:16,580 --> 01:34:17,600
What happened?

2262
01:34:20,700 --> 01:34:21,280
What?

2263
01:34:21,420 --> 01:34:23,140
Why are we all Cowboys now?

2264
01:34:23,760 --> 01:34:25,740
Alright, now I wanna be a Cowboy.

2265
01:34:25,940 --> 01:34:26,260
Okay.

2266
01:34:26,260 --> 01:34:27,440
Yeah, I win.

2267
01:34:27,820 --> 01:34:28,760
Oh, no.

2268
01:34:28,960 --> 01:34:30,480
When did the meta swap?

2269
01:34:31,520 --> 01:34:33,800
I thought we were all gonna be...

2270
01:34:35,100 --> 01:34:35,720
Easy.

2271
01:34:35,800 --> 01:34:37,060
That's why the meta swapped.

2272
01:34:44,810 --> 01:34:46,410
Oh, my God.

2273
01:34:47,490 --> 01:34:49,890
They went back to the past.

2274
01:34:50,230 --> 01:34:51,710
It's Cowboys vs.

2275
01:34:52,190 --> 01:34:52,810
Aliens.

2276
01:34:52,930 --> 01:34:54,810
It's actually...

2277
01:34:55,340 --> 01:34:56,270
Who will win?

2278
01:34:56,310 --> 01:34:58,090
I think the Cowboys are winning, guys.

2279
01:34:58,530 --> 01:35:00,310
Except for one guy.

2280
01:35:00,450 --> 01:35:01,330
All the Junos.

2281
01:35:01,330 --> 01:35:02,090
The Junos are like...

2282
01:35:03,210 --> 01:35:05,330
The Junos are just farming each other.

2283
01:35:05,590 --> 01:35:07,110
What the fuck is this guy?

2284
01:35:07,190 --> 01:35:07,550
Pussy!

2285
01:35:09,120 --> 01:35:09,430
No!

2286
01:35:10,270 --> 01:35:11,510
Fucking pussy.

2287
01:35:12,110 --> 01:35:13,690
They got into it.

2288
01:35:18,390 --> 01:35:19,750
Oh, my God.

2289
01:35:19,850 --> 01:35:21,450
The space Cowboys.

2290
01:35:25,350 --> 01:35:25,970
Alright.

2291
01:35:28,600 --> 01:35:28,910
Alright.

2292
01:35:29,150 --> 01:35:29,990
I swear to God.

2293
01:35:30,070 --> 01:35:33,470
If you fucking play Juno, you're throwing this way to fucking God.

2294
01:35:33,970 --> 01:35:35,410
Maybe that's why I lost.

2295
01:35:38,590 --> 01:35:39,150
Alright.

2296
01:35:44,220 --> 01:35:45,560
It can't be that bad.

2297
01:35:46,640 --> 01:35:47,200
Surely.

2298
01:35:48,900 --> 01:35:50,780
Surely, it can't be that bad, right?

2299
01:35:51,440 --> 01:35:51,720
Surely.

2300
01:35:56,600 --> 01:35:57,160
Surely.

2301
01:35:57,780 --> 01:35:59,620
Surely, this will be better.

2302
01:35:59,700 --> 01:36:00,580
We don't...

2303
01:36:03,200 --> 01:36:04,660
Maybe Surprised Juno is overpowered.

2304
01:36:04,800 --> 01:36:06,360
Juno just has a lot of stuff.

2305
01:36:06,600 --> 01:36:06,820
Okay.

2306
01:36:07,880 --> 01:36:08,620
I don't know.

2307
01:36:08,740 --> 01:36:11,720
I feel like nobody has figured out how to play Juno yet.

2308
01:36:11,980 --> 01:36:12,860
I feel...

2309
01:36:13,380 --> 01:36:14,140
That's the thing.

2310
01:36:14,680 --> 01:36:15,660
I feel like...

2311
01:36:15,660 --> 01:36:17,000
People don't know how to...

2312
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,180
I mean, she literally just came up today.

2313
01:36:19,420 --> 01:36:20,040
Rank wise.

2314
01:36:20,340 --> 01:36:23,660
So, I will not be surprised if no one really knows how to play her mechanic.

2315
01:36:26,680 --> 01:36:27,680
Is that Widow?

2316
01:36:31,690 --> 01:36:32,170
Oh...

2317
01:36:32,170 --> 01:36:32,890
Oh...

2318
01:36:32,890 --> 01:36:33,010
Oh...

2319
01:36:33,010 --> 01:36:34,910
It'll be fine.

2320
01:36:35,070 --> 01:36:35,890
I believe.

2321
01:36:36,310 --> 01:36:37,070
Oh.

2322
01:36:37,370 --> 01:36:38,610
I'm not fine.

2323
01:36:38,770 --> 01:36:39,410
Please.

2324
01:36:39,570 --> 01:36:39,910
Please.

2325
01:36:42,190 --> 01:36:43,050
PLEASE!

2326
01:36:45,470 --> 01:36:47,130
HE'S COMING BACK!

2327
01:36:51,220 --> 01:36:52,440
Oh no.

2328
01:36:54,530 --> 01:36:55,720
Oh my god.

2329
01:36:56,060 --> 01:36:57,720
He came back!

2330
01:36:57,720 --> 01:36:57,920
Yeah!

2331
01:37:01,740 --> 01:37:05,060
Guys, I might need to refund the insurance.

2332
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:06,360
I might need to...

2333
01:37:10,120 --> 01:37:11,780
Oh my god.

2334
01:37:15,260 --> 01:37:17,740
That is a nasty shatter.

2335
01:37:20,840 --> 01:37:24,500
I basically... I basically fucked his charge up.

2336
01:37:24,580 --> 01:37:25,760
I took the sleep kill.

2337
01:37:30,140 --> 01:37:31,800
I took the sleep kill.

2338
01:37:32,140 --> 01:37:32,720
I took the sleep kill.

2339
01:37:32,720 --> 01:37:32,820
I took the sleep kill.

2340
01:37:34,980 --> 01:37:35,560
Alright.

2341
01:37:36,220 --> 01:37:37,460
I'm gonna go up here.

2342
01:37:37,860 --> 01:37:39,740
I guess I'll nano the Ryze.

2343
01:37:40,500 --> 01:37:42,620
I don't think we have enough healing.

2344
01:37:42,920 --> 01:37:43,060
I don't think we have enough healing.

2345
01:37:43,060 --> 01:37:43,900
Not gonna lie.

2346
01:37:46,300 --> 01:37:47,680
Oh, Ryne, please.

2347
01:37:47,880 --> 01:37:49,980
No, Ryne, please.

2348
01:37:50,840 --> 01:37:52,060
No, Ryne, please.

2349
01:37:53,540 --> 01:37:55,100
Oh, hey guys.

2350
01:37:55,420 --> 01:37:57,620
Guys, don't you wanna contest the point?

2351
01:37:57,720 --> 01:38:01,740
Guys, fight our point so we can grab extra tanks!

2352
01:38:03,940 --> 01:38:05,160
Okay, I don't know.

2353
01:38:05,260 --> 01:38:06,760
Oh, man.

2354
01:38:07,140 --> 01:38:08,720
Oh, Ryne.

2355
01:38:09,500 --> 01:38:11,800
I think their Ryne's better.

2356
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:18,200
Guys, I think... I have a feeling that their Ryne's better than our Ryne's.

2357
01:38:18,300 --> 01:38:19,180
I don't know.

2358
01:38:20,480 --> 01:38:21,800
After that...

2359
01:38:21,800 --> 01:38:24,020
After what I just saw...

2360
01:38:24,020 --> 01:38:25,220
Yeah.

2361
01:38:28,080 --> 01:38:29,560
If I nano the Ryne...

2362
01:38:29,560 --> 01:38:29,900
Watch this.

2363
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:30,980
We're gonna get shattered.

2364
01:38:34,520 --> 01:38:36,100
Oh, we did it.

2365
01:38:39,400 --> 01:38:41,220
I'm surprised we didn't get shattered there.

2366
01:38:43,460 --> 01:38:47,300
Usually when you nano the Ryne, the Ryne just shatters people.

2367
01:38:51,940 --> 01:38:52,540
Please.

2368
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:54,080
Guys, please.

2369
01:38:54,180 --> 01:38:55,260
Guys, please!

2370
01:38:55,860 --> 01:38:56,460
Please!

2371
01:38:58,560 --> 01:38:59,880
Please, guys.

2372
01:39:00,460 --> 01:39:01,740
Please, guys.

2373
01:39:01,960 --> 01:39:03,580
Oh, my god.

2374
01:39:06,280 --> 01:39:07,720
Holy shit.

2375
01:39:07,820 --> 01:39:08,620
I don't understand.

2376
01:39:09,200 --> 01:39:12,220
Why is their Ryne peeking their healer?

2377
01:39:12,340 --> 01:39:13,800
But our Ryne...

2378
01:39:13,800 --> 01:39:15,600
Our Ryne's like, fuck that.

2379
01:39:16,140 --> 01:39:17,140
There you go.

2380
01:39:20,800 --> 01:39:22,800
I am giving the heals.

2381
01:39:25,660 --> 01:39:26,480
Oh, please.

2382
01:39:26,580 --> 01:39:26,860
Oh, please.

2383
01:39:26,860 --> 01:39:27,580
I have to reload.

2384
01:39:31,200 --> 01:39:31,960
Oh, no.

2385
01:39:32,040 --> 01:39:32,600
Oh, no.

2386
01:39:32,720 --> 01:39:33,100
No!

2387
01:39:34,220 --> 01:39:34,700
Calypso!

2388
01:39:36,680 --> 01:39:37,160
Okay.

2389
01:39:37,820 --> 01:39:39,940
I'm a little scared that Ryne's going in.

2390
01:39:41,200 --> 01:39:41,920
Oh, nice.

2391
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:42,980
I got the anti.

2392
01:39:44,420 --> 01:39:46,020
Alright, this game...

2393
01:39:46,020 --> 01:39:48,800
This game, I'm doing a lot of anti's now.

2394
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:49,480
I figured...

2395
01:39:49,480 --> 01:39:50,300
Ryne, please!

2396
01:39:50,380 --> 01:39:51,400
Please, Ryne, please!

2397
01:39:51,780 --> 01:39:52,220
Please!

2398
01:39:54,460 --> 01:39:55,920
He still has shatter, too.

2399
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:56,540
That's the thing.

2400
01:39:57,100 --> 01:39:58,420
He still has shatter.

2401
01:40:00,460 --> 01:40:01,180
Oh, no.

2402
01:40:01,240 --> 01:40:01,700
He's coming.

2403
01:40:01,860 --> 01:40:02,440
He's coming over.

2404
01:40:03,560 --> 01:40:04,500
He's coming over.

2405
01:40:08,020 --> 01:40:08,860
Guys, I'm scared.

2406
01:40:09,360 --> 01:40:10,460
Guys, I'm very scared.

2407
01:40:12,040 --> 01:40:13,000
Oh, goodbye.

2408
01:40:13,700 --> 01:40:15,240
Oh, there was a...

2409
01:40:15,240 --> 01:40:16,260
You know what?

2410
01:40:19,080 --> 01:40:19,720
I...

2411
01:40:19,720 --> 01:40:20,260
I...

2412
01:40:20,940 --> 01:40:21,380
I...

2413
01:40:21,380 --> 01:40:22,680
I dropped down.

2414
01:40:22,900 --> 01:40:25,160
Are you fucking kidding me?

2415
01:40:25,300 --> 01:40:28,400
Where did the Torbjorn come from?

2416
01:40:28,760 --> 01:40:29,860
Where did the Torbjorn come from?

2417
01:40:30,420 --> 01:40:33,140
Are you fucking kidding me?

2418
01:40:33,440 --> 01:40:33,480
Are you fucking kidding me?

2419
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:35,560
Holy shit, Ryne.

2420
01:40:35,600 --> 01:40:36,740
I need you to go jump.

2421
01:40:37,020 --> 01:40:39,220
I need you to touch it, Ryne.

2422
01:40:40,540 --> 01:40:41,840
Do your thing.

2423
01:40:42,200 --> 01:40:42,340
Do your thing.

2424
01:40:42,860 --> 01:40:43,660
Do your thing.

2425
01:40:46,260 --> 01:40:46,540
I'm on it.

2426
01:40:46,620 --> 01:40:47,620
I'm gonna...

2427
01:40:47,710 --> 01:40:48,660
Not done!

2428
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:51,380
Okay.

2429
01:40:53,650 --> 01:40:54,340
Alright.

2430
01:40:56,210 --> 01:40:57,720
I love Overwatch.

2431
01:41:01,910 --> 01:41:04,420
I love Overwatch.

2432
01:41:06,220 --> 01:41:08,700
I love Overwatch.

2433
01:41:10,440 --> 01:41:13,460
This guy needs to live.

2434
01:41:13,750 --> 01:41:14,820
This guy.

2435
01:41:16,260 --> 01:41:16,840
Oh, okay.

2436
01:41:17,240 --> 01:41:17,800
Alright.

2437
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:24,080
Guys, I think it's time to hang up Ryne.

2438
01:41:24,240 --> 01:41:26,860
You're not him.

2439
01:41:27,200 --> 01:41:29,440
You're not him, bro.

2440
01:41:30,340 --> 01:41:32,360
Bro, Orisa, you're not him.

2441
01:41:35,280 --> 01:41:36,600
I'm sorry, bro.

2442
01:41:36,720 --> 01:41:37,280
You're not.

2443
01:41:39,620 --> 01:41:40,180
Alright.

2444
01:41:40,400 --> 01:41:42,160
We can do this with Orisa.

2445
01:41:42,260 --> 01:41:42,660
I believe.

2446
01:41:44,100 --> 01:41:45,640
Guys, I love Overwatch.

2447
01:41:46,260 --> 01:41:47,400
Guys, it's...

2448
01:41:47,870 --> 01:41:49,180
such a good game.

2449
01:41:50,400 --> 01:41:53,880
I can quit anytime I want.

2450
01:41:56,140 --> 01:41:56,960
I...

2451
01:41:56,960 --> 01:41:59,740
I can quit anytime.

2452
01:42:01,890 --> 01:42:02,300
How?

2453
01:42:02,440 --> 01:42:04,160
How are you still...

2454
01:42:04,160 --> 01:42:04,760
How?

2455
01:42:05,300 --> 01:42:07,820
Why are you still doing this?

2456
01:42:08,680 --> 01:42:09,460
I...

2457
01:42:09,460 --> 01:42:10,920
Okay, I'm fucking playing.

2458
01:42:11,020 --> 01:42:11,440
You're right.

2459
01:42:11,540 --> 01:42:11,960
Nevermind.

2460
01:42:11,960 --> 01:42:12,060
Nevermind.

2461
01:42:14,680 --> 01:42:15,360
How...

2462
01:42:15,360 --> 01:42:16,980
How are you still like this?

2463
01:42:17,220 --> 01:42:18,160
How are you...

2464
01:42:18,160 --> 01:42:20,940
How are you still like this?

2465
01:42:22,860 --> 01:42:24,220
You're literally...

2466
01:42:25,760 --> 01:42:28,060
Guys, I can quit anytime I want.

2467
01:42:28,340 --> 01:42:29,020
Chat.

2468
01:42:30,080 --> 01:42:34,280
I can stop playing this game anytime I want.

2469
01:42:34,920 --> 01:42:35,600
Alright?

2470
01:42:35,700 --> 01:42:37,800
I don't have a problem.

2471
01:42:37,800 --> 01:42:38,020
I don't have a problem.

2472
01:42:39,880 --> 01:42:40,760
There you go.

2473
01:42:45,710 --> 01:42:46,750
Okay, thank God.

2474
01:42:47,670 --> 01:42:48,290
Okay, thank God.

2475
01:42:48,630 --> 01:42:49,110
Alright.

2476
01:42:49,930 --> 01:42:51,550
That's one pick, guys.

2477
01:42:54,030 --> 01:42:55,250
That's one pick.

2478
01:42:55,690 --> 01:42:55,970
That's one pick.

2479
01:42:57,050 --> 01:42:57,530
That's one pick.

2480
01:42:57,530 --> 01:42:58,330
Guys, he's anti.

2481
01:42:59,150 --> 01:42:59,390
Guys, he's anti.

2482
01:43:01,510 --> 01:43:03,110
This is all we needed.

2483
01:43:03,590 --> 01:43:03,950
This is all we needed.

2484
01:43:05,630 --> 01:43:06,490
Here we go.

2485
01:43:06,490 --> 01:43:08,310
That's all we needed.

2486
01:43:09,830 --> 01:43:10,390
Alright.

2487
01:43:10,910 --> 01:43:11,470
Okay.

2488
01:43:12,270 --> 01:43:13,810
He should have shatter now.

2489
01:43:14,110 --> 01:43:15,510
There's no way he doesn't.

2490
01:43:16,210 --> 01:43:17,510
He should have shatter.

2491
01:43:18,230 --> 01:43:20,130
This Rein has been doing a lot.

2492
01:43:26,360 --> 01:43:28,620
I thought he was gonna... I timed it wrong.

2493
01:43:28,980 --> 01:43:30,480
I thought he was gonna...

2494
01:43:31,440 --> 01:43:32,000
Alright.

2495
01:43:36,320 --> 01:43:36,880
Run.

2496
01:43:46,180 --> 01:43:46,760
Nice.

2497
01:43:46,760 --> 01:43:46,760
Nice.

2498
01:43:47,600 --> 01:43:48,180
Okay.

2499
01:43:48,720 --> 01:43:49,300
Alright.

2500
01:43:49,400 --> 01:43:49,960
That's good.

2501
01:43:51,160 --> 01:43:51,860
That's good.

2502
01:43:52,320 --> 01:43:54,040
Please keep Orisa alive.

2503
01:43:54,240 --> 01:43:55,260
Just keep him alive.

2504
01:43:56,260 --> 01:43:57,480
Save the Orisa.

2505
01:44:01,160 --> 01:44:01,840
That's good.

2506
01:44:02,080 --> 01:44:03,840
I almost used nano.

2507
01:44:03,960 --> 01:44:05,620
But it was no use.

2508
01:44:08,400 --> 01:44:09,260
That's good.

2509
01:44:09,700 --> 01:44:10,420
That's good.

2510
01:44:10,460 --> 01:44:11,400
I didn't use nano.

2511
01:44:13,620 --> 01:44:15,240
I almost used it.

2512
01:44:15,300 --> 01:44:16,100
But I did not.

2513
01:44:17,240 --> 01:44:18,000
That's good.

2514
01:44:18,060 --> 01:44:19,740
I didn't use nano.

2515
01:44:19,820 --> 01:44:20,340
That's good.

2516
01:44:20,340 --> 01:44:20,340
I didn't use nano.

2517
01:44:20,340 --> 01:44:21,540
I'm so happy I did.

2518
01:44:22,460 --> 01:44:26,160
The Cassidy killing me was like the best decision he ever made.

2519
01:44:27,260 --> 01:44:28,120
The Cassidy killing me was like the best decision he ever made.

2520
01:44:28,120 --> 01:44:28,560
Okay.

2521
01:44:28,620 --> 01:44:30,120
He definitely has shatter for real this time.

2522
01:44:30,320 --> 01:44:30,500
Okay.

2523
01:44:30,500 --> 01:44:30,500
He definitely has shatter for real this time.

2524
01:44:30,500 --> 01:44:32,140
I'm fucking not getting close to that.

2525
01:44:35,980 --> 01:44:36,820
Oh god.

2526
01:44:41,220 --> 01:44:41,980
There we go.

2527
01:44:43,780 --> 01:44:44,780
That's a shatter.

2528
01:44:45,080 --> 01:44:46,580
That's a shatter right there.

2529
01:44:48,420 --> 01:44:49,340
He wants to...

2530
01:44:49,340 --> 01:44:51,740
He wants to...

2531
01:44:51,740 --> 01:44:54,880
I still walked into it.

2532
01:44:54,880 --> 01:44:55,080
I still walked into it.

2533
01:44:55,780 --> 01:44:58,620
I even knew he was going to do it.

2534
01:44:58,940 --> 01:45:00,040
I even knew he was going to do it.

2535
01:45:00,040 --> 01:45:01,300
I was like, oh there it is.

2536
01:45:01,360 --> 01:45:02,000
This is going to happen.

2537
01:45:02,980 --> 01:45:05,300
I even walked into it.

2538
01:45:05,380 --> 01:45:06,460
I was like, there it is.

2539
01:45:06,840 --> 01:45:09,060
I think at that point I just accepted it.

2540
01:45:09,180 --> 01:45:09,980
I was just like, oh.

2541
01:45:10,860 --> 01:45:11,680
This is weird.

2542
01:45:11,740 --> 01:45:12,600
I'm going to get shattered.

2543
01:45:12,800 --> 01:45:13,700
There's no point.

2544
01:45:15,740 --> 01:45:16,140
Guys.

2545
01:45:16,760 --> 01:45:18,120
There's no point living.

2546
01:45:18,600 --> 01:45:19,840
There's no point living.

2547
01:45:20,180 --> 01:45:22,240
I knew it was going to happen regardless.

2548
01:45:24,720 --> 01:45:26,420
No matter what I do.

2549
01:45:26,480 --> 01:45:27,300
I was going to get hit.

2550
01:45:27,600 --> 01:45:29,400
There was no saving me there.

2551
01:45:31,780 --> 01:45:33,500
There was no saving me.

2552
01:45:34,800 --> 01:45:35,280
Okay.

2553
01:45:35,320 --> 01:45:35,980
We got the...

2554
01:45:36,680 --> 01:45:37,440
We got the ride.

2555
01:45:39,860 --> 01:45:41,260
We literally got the ride.

2556
01:45:46,210 --> 01:45:46,870
That's good.

2557
01:45:46,870 --> 01:45:47,070
That's good.

2558
01:45:50,480 --> 01:45:51,380
I embraced.

2559
01:45:51,760 --> 01:45:52,880
I embraced it.

2560
01:45:56,900 --> 01:46:01,400
Where did he come from?

2561
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,660
Where the fuck did he come from?

2562
01:46:05,340 --> 01:46:05,460
Where the fuck did he come from?

2563
01:46:05,780 --> 01:46:06,540
It's okay.

2564
01:46:06,660 --> 01:46:08,220
We have literally one fight.

2565
01:46:08,260 --> 01:46:10,300
Please Orisa, do not use your ult.

2566
01:46:10,460 --> 01:46:12,380
We have one fight left.

2567
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:14,240
We need you to go.

2568
01:46:14,300 --> 01:46:15,500
We need someone to go Lucio.

2569
01:46:16,260 --> 01:46:17,260
Go Lucio.

2570
01:46:17,260 --> 01:46:17,960
Oh, thank god.

2571
01:46:18,080 --> 01:46:18,280
Okay.

2572
01:46:19,840 --> 01:46:20,280
Alright.

2573
01:46:21,180 --> 01:46:24,200
I literally went left because I thought he was going to go left.

2574
01:46:24,300 --> 01:46:25,440
But then he went right?

2575
01:46:33,030 --> 01:46:33,470
Alright.

2576
01:46:38,040 --> 01:46:38,480
Okay.

2577
01:46:40,040 --> 01:46:40,480
Alright.

2578
01:46:44,040 --> 01:46:44,480
Okay.

2579
01:46:44,560 --> 01:46:45,280
I didn't get hit.

2580
01:46:48,940 --> 01:46:49,380
Please.

2581
01:46:49,580 --> 01:46:50,020
Orisa.

2582
01:46:55,870 --> 01:46:56,670
Why...

2583
01:46:56,670 --> 01:46:59,290
Why do they always run away?

2584
01:46:59,910 --> 01:47:08,330
Why do they always run away?

2585
01:47:08,530 --> 01:47:09,530
I don't understand.

2586
01:47:11,650 --> 01:47:13,210
I'm avoiding...

2587
01:47:13,210 --> 01:47:14,390
I'm avoiding this.

2588
01:47:14,410 --> 01:47:16,490
I'm avoiding this Ana.

2589
01:47:16,930 --> 01:47:17,610
No not Ana.

2590
01:47:17,690 --> 01:47:18,070
That's me.

2591
01:47:18,150 --> 01:47:19,210
I'm avoiding myself too.

2592
01:47:19,370 --> 01:47:21,170
I'm avoiding this Orisa.

2593
01:47:21,170 --> 01:47:22,730
I'm avoiding this Orisa.

2594
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:41,260
Why does he keep... Why does he keep running away?

2595
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:51,120
Why did you keep running away?

2596
01:47:55,080 --> 01:47:56,520
Oh my god.

2597
01:47:57,240 --> 01:48:01,480
I swear, I'm gonna use voice comms if I get another fucking tank like that.

2598
01:48:01,680 --> 01:48:03,220
I swear to god.

2599
01:48:03,500 --> 01:48:07,620
I'll use my voice comms and be like, FUCKING PEEK!

2600
01:48:11,960 --> 01:48:13,120
I can't.

2601
01:48:13,140 --> 01:48:14,740
I fucking can't.

2602
01:48:14,960 --> 01:48:19,480
I'm gonna fucking use voice comms so I don't have to deal with that again.

2603
01:48:20,380 --> 01:48:21,100
Thank you.

2604
01:48:21,120 --> 01:48:22,980
This is not scrims.

2605
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:24,600
Or was it skirmish?

2606
01:48:25,180 --> 01:48:27,120
This is not skirmish.

2607
01:48:29,980 --> 01:48:31,660
I've never...

2608
01:48:31,660 --> 01:48:33,100
From...

2609
01:48:34,240 --> 01:48:45,040
From having a fucking amazing Winston player, to dealing with one of the most dogshit tank players.

2610
01:48:47,100 --> 01:48:48,700
Oh my god.

2611
01:48:51,220 --> 01:48:53,140
I can get top 500 this season.

2612
01:48:53,260 --> 01:48:53,620
Wanna bet?

2613
01:48:54,100 --> 01:48:54,920
Paladin Knight?

2614
01:48:55,020 --> 01:48:57,300
I bet you I can get top 500 this season.

2615
01:48:57,780 --> 01:49:01,420
I didn't have time to really grind out this last season because...

2616
01:49:02,120 --> 01:49:03,740
I had to move and everything.

2617
01:49:06,280 --> 01:49:09,100
Alright, bet.

2618
01:49:10,240 --> 01:49:13,340
What do I get if I get top 500 this season?

2619
01:49:13,940 --> 01:49:14,880
What do I get?

2620
01:49:16,280 --> 01:49:16,800
Yeah.

2621
01:49:17,520 --> 01:49:18,040
Bet?

2622
01:49:18,140 --> 01:49:18,360
Yeah.

2623
01:49:18,640 --> 01:49:19,060
Yeah.

2624
01:49:19,060 --> 01:49:21,600
I bet you guys I can get top 500 this season.

2625
01:49:22,480 --> 01:49:23,040
Easily.

2626
01:49:25,360 --> 01:49:26,520
Where's Paladin Knight?

2627
01:49:26,680 --> 01:49:27,200
Paladin Knight!

2628
01:49:29,120 --> 01:49:30,120
What do you wanna bet?

2629
01:49:30,320 --> 01:49:31,720
You promise not me.

2630
01:49:31,980 --> 01:49:32,240
Yeah?

2631
01:49:32,420 --> 01:49:32,960
Bet!

2632
01:49:33,220 --> 01:49:33,580
Oh.

2633
01:49:35,360 --> 01:49:35,920
Bitch.

2634
01:49:36,820 --> 01:49:37,920
What the fuck?

2635
01:49:39,560 --> 01:49:41,140
You can shoot your toes?

2636
01:49:41,820 --> 01:49:43,460
He shot me in the toes!

2637
01:49:46,320 --> 01:49:47,020
That's a...

2638
01:49:47,020 --> 01:49:47,760
Idiot.

2639
01:49:50,180 --> 01:49:52,680
That's a fucking idiot.

2640
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:53,040
Fucking idiot.

2641
01:49:53,040 --> 01:49:56,760
He kept trying to shoot me through the fucking...

2642
01:50:00,500 --> 01:50:01,460
Fucking idiot.

2643
01:50:03,360 --> 01:50:04,000
Alright.

2644
01:50:04,540 --> 01:50:06,660
There was no way I was gonna live there.

2645
01:50:06,920 --> 01:50:08,340
There was no way.

2646
01:50:13,040 --> 01:50:14,620
Oh my god.

2647
01:50:14,940 --> 01:50:16,420
Bro, fuck off.

2648
01:50:17,780 --> 01:50:19,640
Bro, what the fuck?

2649
01:50:20,240 --> 01:50:21,540
Oh shit!

2650
01:50:21,940 --> 01:50:23,380
That's so fucked!

2651
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:25,500
And he missed!

2652
01:50:26,060 --> 01:50:27,500
He fucking missed.

2653
01:50:27,680 --> 01:50:28,700
That's embarrassing.

2654
01:50:29,480 --> 01:50:31,200
He actually missed.

2655
01:50:33,160 --> 01:50:34,320
That's fucking right.

2656
01:50:34,360 --> 01:50:34,920
You missed that.

2657
01:50:35,300 --> 01:50:36,100
Yeah, fucking sleep dart.

2658
01:50:36,260 --> 01:50:36,760
Sleep dart now.

2659
01:50:36,920 --> 01:50:37,260
Bitch.

2660
01:50:40,810 --> 01:50:42,270
Sleep dart now, bitch.

2661
01:50:42,960 --> 01:50:43,830
Oh, okay.

2662
01:50:45,530 --> 01:50:46,950
Oh my god.

2663
01:50:49,930 --> 01:50:51,570
What do we get if we don't Doki?

2664
01:50:51,730 --> 01:50:54,350
I don't have to tell you because like I'm gonna get it.

2665
01:50:54,650 --> 01:50:56,830
Yeah, you might as well just give me the prize now.

2666
01:50:57,810 --> 01:50:59,510
Oh my god that instant lock Mercy.

2667
01:50:59,830 --> 01:51:00,990
I'm not- fuck this.

2668
01:51:02,130 --> 01:51:03,390
Actually no, I don't want to throw.

2669
01:51:03,570 --> 01:51:12,930
I don't want to throw.

2670
01:51:12,930 --> 01:51:13,530
Alright.

2671
01:51:13,770 --> 01:51:15,590
I like you, Kappa.

2672
01:51:20,710 --> 01:51:21,010
Alright.

2673
01:51:23,130 --> 01:51:25,870
The sun is in a new location today.

2674
01:51:27,630 --> 01:51:28,650
Oh, like this?

2675
01:51:29,190 --> 01:51:31,310
Is that not where it was before?

2676
01:51:36,610 --> 01:51:37,970
That's not how bets work.

2677
01:51:38,270 --> 01:51:40,910
Well, this bet is obviously I'm gonna win this bet.

2678
01:51:41,050 --> 01:51:42,190
That's basically it.

2679
01:51:42,930 --> 01:51:45,310
I'm obviously gonna win this bet, guys.

2680
01:51:50,830 --> 01:51:54,870
So all I'm saying is that you might as well just reward me now.

2681
01:51:56,310 --> 01:51:56,750
Chat.

2682
01:51:56,930 --> 01:51:57,970
You might as well.

2683
01:52:01,430 --> 01:52:03,550
I can get top 500 this season.

2684
01:52:03,750 --> 01:52:04,370
It'll be so easy.

2685
01:52:04,650 --> 01:52:06,170
I have the- I don't have the time.

2686
01:52:06,330 --> 01:52:09,170
But like I have more time than before.

2687
01:52:10,290 --> 01:52:13,690
Before I had- I had to move and everything.

2688
01:52:17,010 --> 01:52:19,510
But now, now I have the time.

2689
01:52:20,910 --> 01:52:21,970
Jesus Christ.

2690
01:52:23,450 --> 01:52:27,430
Usually I'm not here, but like I'm scared for a Winston.

2691
01:52:27,930 --> 01:52:28,570
Honestly.

2692
01:52:28,830 --> 01:52:30,750
I'm actually so scared for a Winston.

2693
01:52:37,830 --> 01:52:38,470
Alright.

2694
01:52:38,670 --> 01:52:39,310
No!

2695
01:52:39,550 --> 01:52:40,070
Winston!

2696
01:52:41,110 --> 01:52:41,630
No!

2697
01:52:42,850 --> 01:52:47,250
I got body blocked by my fucking fat DPS players!

2698
01:52:52,970 --> 01:52:53,350
Okay.

2699
01:52:53,850 --> 01:52:57,970
God damn it.

2700
01:52:58,310 --> 01:53:00,250
God fucking damn it.

2701
01:53:00,850 --> 01:53:02,830
Where the fuck is my Winston?

2702
01:53:03,750 --> 01:53:04,830
There he is.

2703
01:53:05,970 --> 01:53:06,630
There you go.

2704
01:53:09,090 --> 01:53:10,690
Guys, I killed our Ashe.

2705
01:53:12,510 --> 01:53:13,110
Easy.

2706
01:53:17,640 --> 01:53:18,580
There you go.

2707
01:53:20,060 --> 01:53:21,520
Wait, I killed my duo.

2708
01:53:24,580 --> 01:53:25,180
Whoops.

2709
01:53:25,320 --> 01:53:27,300
I forgot my duo was the Ashe.

2710
01:53:30,640 --> 01:53:31,240
Alright.

2711
01:53:32,660 --> 01:53:33,260
Hehe.

2712
01:53:35,740 --> 01:53:36,340
Alright.

2713
01:53:36,500 --> 01:53:36,820
Nice.

2714
01:53:37,120 --> 01:53:37,540
We're fine.

2715
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:40,180
Everything is fine.

2716
01:53:40,920 --> 01:53:42,320
Everything is awesome.

2717
01:53:43,300 --> 01:53:44,660
Ba-da-da-da-da.

2718
01:53:44,660 --> 01:53:45,840
Ba-da-da-da-da.

2719
01:53:46,040 --> 01:53:48,180
Ba-da-da-da-da-da.

2720
01:53:49,040 --> 01:53:50,160
Keep an eye out.

2721
01:53:50,720 --> 01:53:51,320
Oh.

2722
01:53:51,700 --> 01:53:53,560
I hear people walking up.

2723
01:53:53,680 --> 01:53:54,160
Winston!

2724
01:53:56,600 --> 01:53:58,260
Oh my god.

2725
01:54:01,160 --> 01:54:03,020
Guys, I think I hate...

2726
01:54:03,760 --> 01:54:06,160
I think I hate my Winston player.

2727
01:54:06,440 --> 01:54:07,040
Guys.

2728
01:54:07,040 --> 01:54:08,480
I think...

2729
01:54:09,560 --> 01:54:12,460
I think we have a very bad Winston today.

2730
01:54:13,340 --> 01:54:14,760
You think he can touch it?

2731
01:54:14,840 --> 01:54:15,540
There's no way.

2732
01:54:15,620 --> 01:54:16,620
He fucked it up already.

2733
01:54:18,120 --> 01:54:19,240
Yeah, I hate it.

2734
01:54:19,400 --> 01:54:21,300
I didn't even need to...

2735
01:54:21,300 --> 01:54:23,520
I already could tell.

2736
01:54:24,100 --> 01:54:26,680
I could tell he was gonna not...

2737
01:54:26,680 --> 01:54:28,480
I saw him hit the...

2738
01:54:29,240 --> 01:54:31,780
I saw him hit the fucking...

2739
01:54:31,780 --> 01:54:34,260
The wall up there.

2740
01:54:34,380 --> 01:54:35,680
And I was like, yeah, you're not.

2741
01:54:35,680 --> 01:54:37,640
You're not gonna make it.

2742
01:54:37,700 --> 01:54:38,580
I timed it already.

2743
01:54:41,020 --> 01:54:42,380
Oh god, please.

2744
01:54:42,440 --> 01:54:44,440
I don't wanna fucking heal, but I wanna shoot.

2745
01:54:47,020 --> 01:54:47,620
Alright.

2746
01:54:50,480 --> 01:54:51,080
Alright.

2747
01:54:51,480 --> 01:54:52,460
Here you go.

2748
01:54:53,220 --> 01:54:53,820
Winston!

2749
01:54:57,520 --> 01:55:00,540
I can't save you, my buddy.

2750
01:55:00,740 --> 01:55:01,720
My man.

2751
01:55:02,680 --> 01:55:03,280
Bro.

2752
01:55:03,800 --> 01:55:04,900
I can't.

2753
01:55:04,900 --> 01:55:06,640
Oh my god.

2754
01:55:06,820 --> 01:55:07,380
Bro.

2755
01:55:07,780 --> 01:55:08,460
Like...

2756
01:55:12,620 --> 01:55:15,140
I cannot save you, bitch.

2757
01:55:16,180 --> 01:55:16,700
I can't.

2758
01:55:16,700 --> 01:55:17,820
Me pee with bath.

2759
01:55:18,100 --> 01:55:18,780
Me pee with...

2760
01:55:18,780 --> 01:55:20,880
Our Mercy literally has 6k healing.

2761
01:55:21,240 --> 01:55:21,920
Our...

2762
01:55:21,920 --> 01:55:22,980
Our Mercy.

2763
01:55:23,040 --> 01:55:23,720
This is...

2764
01:55:26,640 --> 01:55:29,580
This is not an Overwatch day, I feel like.

2765
01:55:30,900 --> 01:55:32,300
Oh my god.

2766
01:55:32,320 --> 01:55:32,660
Winston.

2767
01:55:32,880 --> 01:55:33,620
Yet again.

2768
01:55:33,620 --> 01:55:35,520
Winston, please.

2769
01:55:38,100 --> 01:55:38,860
Alright.

2770
01:55:39,320 --> 01:55:40,560
Guess I die here.

2771
01:55:41,720 --> 01:55:43,840
I die here.

2772
01:55:48,260 --> 01:55:50,220
Maybe I need a third!

2773
01:55:50,540 --> 01:55:53,500
Maybe I need the third to play tank!

2774
01:55:54,140 --> 01:55:54,520
I...

2775
01:55:54,520 --> 01:55:57,720
I think.

2776
01:55:57,960 --> 01:56:02,920
I think I need to grab a second insurance just to play tank.

2777
01:56:03,120 --> 01:56:03,300
I...

2778
01:56:03,300 --> 01:56:03,440
I said.

2779
01:56:03,440 --> 01:56:03,600
I'm being beaten by someone else!

2780
01:56:03,600 --> 01:56:05,600
I feel like I'm being played by terrible tanks right now.

2781
01:56:06,600 --> 01:56:08,620
So he gave me that one...

2782
01:56:08,620 --> 01:56:10,240
OH MY GOD!

2783
01:56:10,280 --> 01:56:12,040
WHAT DID I DO?

2784
01:56:13,620 --> 01:56:15,660
Like, what do we do?

2785
01:56:16,200 --> 01:56:19,380
I couldn't even heal him in time.

2786
01:56:20,470 --> 01:56:22,380
Bro, you're not him!

2787
01:56:23,200 --> 01:56:25,740
You're actually not him!

2788
01:56:29,540 --> 01:56:31,260
Holy shit.

2789
01:56:33,600 --> 01:56:34,880
Oh, fucking hell.

2790
01:56:38,100 --> 01:56:42,580
Jesus Christ, I might as well learn fucking Juno at this point.

2791
01:56:42,880 --> 01:56:46,720
I need a tank and a DPS.

2792
01:56:46,840 --> 01:56:51,580
The first game was like a tank and a DPS issue.

2793
01:56:51,760 --> 01:56:54,980
Now we're having tank issues.

2794
01:56:56,680 --> 01:57:01,320
Like, no amount of healing is gonna fucking save him.

2795
01:57:06,730 --> 01:57:08,730
I swear to God, Wynton, I...

2796
01:57:09,890 --> 01:57:11,850
I swear to God, Wynton.

2797
01:57:12,450 --> 01:57:14,470
Oh, thank God, at least he got somebody.

2798
01:57:18,630 --> 01:57:19,670
Oh my god.

2799
01:57:20,450 --> 01:57:20,890
Please.

2800
01:57:21,430 --> 01:57:22,830
Wynton, you're a little bit too up ahead.

2801
01:57:23,030 --> 01:57:24,210
You're a little bit too ahead.

2802
01:57:25,130 --> 01:57:25,570
I...

2803
01:57:25,570 --> 01:57:27,850
I don't like that.

2804
01:57:28,930 --> 01:57:30,090
I don't like that.

2805
01:57:30,150 --> 01:57:31,430
I really don't like that.

2806
01:57:31,450 --> 01:57:32,050
You're so...

2807
01:57:32,050 --> 01:57:33,230
You're so ahead.

2808
01:57:38,280 --> 01:57:39,060
Fuck it.

2809
01:57:40,340 --> 01:57:41,140
Fuck it.

2810
01:57:41,220 --> 01:57:41,820
Two alts.

2811
01:57:43,520 --> 01:57:45,760
I don't trust... I don't trust team.

2812
01:57:46,020 --> 01:57:47,680
I don't trust team.

2813
01:57:48,080 --> 01:57:50,940
I... I don't trust the team.

2814
01:57:53,500 --> 01:57:55,840
Oh my God, I hit my head up.

2815
01:57:57,280 --> 01:57:57,880
Alright.

2816
01:57:59,460 --> 01:58:00,520
Wynton, please.

2817
01:58:01,200 --> 01:58:01,800
Please.

2818
01:58:02,420 --> 01:58:05,860
I swear to God, if we lose this, I'm grabbing a third plate.

2819
01:58:05,860 --> 01:58:07,000
I...

2820
01:58:12,200 --> 01:58:15,840
They have Reaper.

2821
01:58:16,400 --> 01:58:18,900
Oh God.

2822
01:58:21,740 --> 01:58:22,440
Okay.

2823
01:58:24,420 --> 01:58:25,820
Please.

2824
01:58:26,740 --> 01:58:28,140
Please.

2825
01:58:28,260 --> 01:58:28,560
Why?

2826
01:58:29,160 --> 01:58:31,440
Why, Wynton?

2827
01:58:33,950 --> 01:58:35,830
Oh my God.

2828
01:58:35,950 --> 01:58:37,690
Actually, why?

2829
01:58:37,690 --> 01:58:38,010
Why?

2830
01:58:39,490 --> 01:58:41,710
Why did he do that?

2831
01:58:42,340 --> 01:58:43,650
What is Bro doing?

2832
01:58:45,350 --> 01:58:47,390
What is he doing?

2833
01:58:49,750 --> 01:58:51,010
Oh God.

2834
01:58:52,400 --> 01:58:52,790
Please.

2835
01:58:53,030 --> 01:58:53,750
Please.

2836
01:58:56,770 --> 01:58:57,550
Please.

2837
01:58:57,550 --> 01:58:58,330
Please.

2838
01:58:59,810 --> 01:59:01,050
I'm trying.

2839
01:59:02,380 --> 01:59:03,170
I'm trying.

2840
01:59:03,170 --> 01:59:03,490
I'm trying.

2841
01:59:06,150 --> 01:59:06,670
No!

2842
01:59:07,450 --> 01:59:09,190
Oh God, I didn't want to get crushed.

2843
01:59:09,510 --> 01:59:11,370
I could tell I was going to get crushed.

2844
01:59:12,630 --> 01:59:14,510
At least Wynton...

2845
01:59:15,710 --> 01:59:17,130
Wynton is the lead.

2846
01:59:25,430 --> 01:59:28,490
Oh, he has ult.

2847
01:59:28,750 --> 01:59:30,410
That Reaphras ult, though.

2848
01:59:31,430 --> 01:59:32,010
No!

2849
01:59:32,010 --> 01:59:32,010
No!

2850
01:59:32,090 --> 01:59:32,910
Repress all!

2851
01:59:33,110 --> 01:59:34,470
I can feel the all!

2852
01:59:34,730 --> 01:59:35,630
Oh god.

2853
01:59:37,050 --> 01:59:38,530
Are you fucking...

2854
01:59:42,010 --> 01:59:43,370
Give me a sec.

2855
01:59:43,510 --> 01:59:44,670
I'm gonna DM a tank player.

2856
01:59:45,030 --> 01:59:46,290
I can't.

2857
01:59:46,610 --> 01:59:47,850
Give me a sec.

2858
01:59:47,970 --> 01:59:49,850
I'm gonna DM a tank player.

2859
01:59:56,110 --> 01:59:58,910
My sanity cannot take this anymore.

2860
02:00:00,410 --> 02:00:03,530
I cannot take this anymore.

2861
02:00:17,290 --> 02:00:19,010
Oh my god.

2862
02:00:30,410 --> 02:00:31,070
I can't.

2863
02:00:31,070 --> 02:00:33,390
I can't.

2864
02:00:33,430 --> 02:00:34,910
He's still playing Winston.

2865
02:00:35,290 --> 02:00:37,410
He's actually...

2866
02:00:41,070 --> 02:00:42,490
Rage bait.

2867
02:00:46,990 --> 02:00:48,470
Oh my god.

2868
02:00:49,930 --> 02:00:51,690
Holy fuck.

2869
02:00:53,090 --> 02:00:54,590
Oh my god.

2870
02:00:54,650 --> 02:00:58,670
How am I supposed to heal when he's fucking killing himself non-stop?

2871
02:01:05,700 --> 02:01:07,180
Holy shit.

2872
02:01:07,260 --> 02:01:09,880
You're fucking terrible at tanks.

2873
02:01:10,420 --> 02:01:11,520
You want more hands?

2874
02:01:11,520 --> 02:01:12,920
Damn, I play Life Weaver.

2875
02:01:13,240 --> 02:01:15,880
I fucking play Life Weaver, you whore.

2876
02:01:19,050 --> 02:01:22,200
Bro, you're literally the worst fucking tank today.

2877
02:01:23,500 --> 02:01:27,780
I cannot heal you when you're always trying to kill yourself.

2878
02:01:28,600 --> 02:01:29,340
Like...

2879
02:01:32,360 --> 02:01:33,600
Oh my god.

2880
02:01:33,640 --> 02:01:35,280
If that's what he wants...

2881
02:01:35,280 --> 02:01:36,460
Oh, yeah!

2882
02:01:36,640 --> 02:01:38,020
Let me fucking heal!

2883
02:01:38,240 --> 02:01:39,140
Let me heal bot!

2884
02:01:39,600 --> 02:01:40,160
Yeah!

2885
02:01:40,960 --> 02:01:41,820
Heal bot!

2886
02:01:42,120 --> 02:01:42,600
Let's go!

2887
02:01:45,640 --> 02:01:46,200
Whoa!

2888
02:01:48,920 --> 02:01:49,840
Oh, sorry.

2889
02:01:50,080 --> 02:01:51,220
I was too busy healing.

2890
02:01:51,420 --> 02:01:53,100
You want me to do something about it?

2891
02:01:56,920 --> 02:01:57,480
Alright.

2892
02:01:59,600 --> 02:02:00,860
Alright, let's see.

2893
02:02:01,860 --> 02:02:02,240
Okay.

2894
02:02:03,500 --> 02:02:04,200
Okay.

2895
02:02:05,040 --> 02:02:07,120
Like I said, I can't heal stupid.

2896
02:02:11,610 --> 02:02:11,960
Alright.

2897
02:02:12,380 --> 02:02:14,540
Here, have a fucking lotus.

2898
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:16,320
Have a lotus.

2899
02:02:19,500 --> 02:02:20,200
Alright.

2900
02:02:23,690 --> 02:02:24,320
Here we go.

2901
02:02:24,320 --> 02:02:24,420
Here we go.

2902
02:02:27,140 --> 02:02:29,100
Oh, no one wants to take my flower.

2903
02:02:29,280 --> 02:02:29,560
Whoa!

2904
02:02:31,580 --> 02:02:32,100
Yeah!

2905
02:02:32,100 --> 02:02:35,020
Is that enough heals for you, you fucking whore?

2906
02:02:37,080 --> 02:02:37,600
Whoa!

2907
02:02:40,520 --> 02:02:41,040
Yeah!

2908
02:02:43,100 --> 02:02:44,060
I'm fucking dead.

2909
02:02:45,100 --> 02:02:46,500
There's nothing I can do.

2910
02:02:46,500 --> 02:02:46,580
Yeah.

2911
02:02:52,720 --> 02:02:53,960
Oh my god.

2912
02:02:58,040 --> 02:02:59,340
Oh my god.

2913
02:03:00,640 --> 02:03:01,320
Fucking hell.

2914
02:03:02,280 --> 02:03:03,940
I'm gonna fucking plant a tree.

2915
02:03:07,540 --> 02:03:08,280
Oh, wait.

2916
02:03:08,380 --> 02:03:09,060
What am I doing?

2917
02:03:09,140 --> 02:03:10,060
I'm left-clicking.

2918
02:03:12,040 --> 02:03:12,720
Fucking hell.

2919
02:03:12,780 --> 02:03:13,120
Go in.

2920
02:03:13,120 --> 02:03:16,780
I swear to god, you don't go in after I planted a tree.

2921
02:03:16,940 --> 02:03:18,780
I swear to god.

2922
02:03:19,060 --> 02:03:21,700
I've literally gave you guys a tree.

2923
02:03:21,900 --> 02:03:24,100
I... I don't know what you want.

2924
02:03:24,300 --> 02:03:26,540
I gave you a fucking tree.

2925
02:03:26,860 --> 02:03:27,460
I...

2926
02:03:28,140 --> 02:03:30,880
We just needed to walk forward.

2927
02:03:39,100 --> 02:03:40,380
Oh, shit.

2928
02:03:40,800 --> 02:03:42,300
Insane Winston player.

2929
02:03:42,300 --> 02:03:44,340
Oh my god.

2930
02:03:47,560 --> 02:03:49,600
Fucking feeding your ass out.

2931
02:03:49,800 --> 02:03:52,480
And then blaming the support because...

2932
02:03:52,480 --> 02:03:53,000
Whoa!

2933
02:03:53,520 --> 02:03:55,220
I'm not getting heals.

2934
02:03:56,040 --> 02:03:57,160
No way.

2935
02:03:57,400 --> 02:03:57,760
Right?

2936
02:03:58,220 --> 02:04:02,220
Oh, you finally realized that Winston wasn't it?

2937
02:04:02,400 --> 02:04:04,500
You fucking finally realized that?

2938
02:04:04,720 --> 02:04:05,380
Wow.

2939
02:04:07,960 --> 02:04:08,700
Damn.

2940
02:04:08,840 --> 02:04:10,040
We're losing anyway.

2941
02:04:10,160 --> 02:04:11,860
Thank god placements don't matter.

2942
02:04:14,740 --> 02:04:15,760
Thank god.

2943
02:04:17,240 --> 02:04:17,880
Yippee.

2944
02:04:19,100 --> 02:04:21,060
It would be funny if I killed him.

2945
02:04:24,900 --> 02:04:25,540
Alright.

2946
02:04:29,320 --> 02:04:29,960
Woooo.

2947
02:04:32,640 --> 02:04:33,720
Oh, hey.

2948
02:04:34,800 --> 02:04:35,760
Too bad.

2949
02:04:37,840 --> 02:04:38,480
Well.

2950
02:04:41,540 --> 02:04:43,980
What if I pull my duo back to me?

2951
02:04:44,100 --> 02:04:45,020
I want that payload.

2952
02:04:45,500 --> 02:04:46,460
Slash character.

2953
02:04:46,460 --> 02:04:47,540
Oh my god.

2954
02:04:48,080 --> 02:04:49,680
That's actually crazy.

2955
02:04:50,720 --> 02:04:53,620
I took it one for that.

2956
02:04:54,680 --> 02:04:56,640
That's absolutely insane.

2957
02:04:57,660 --> 02:04:58,220
You got me out of business.

2958
02:04:58,640 --> 02:04:59,240
I'm full.

2959
02:04:59,340 --> 02:04:59,880
Charged.

2960
02:05:00,860 --> 02:05:02,300
Oh, now he talks?

2961
02:05:03,540 --> 02:05:04,740
Holy fuck.

2962
02:05:05,240 --> 02:05:06,740
Oh, now he talks.

2963
02:05:06,780 --> 02:05:07,680
This is not winnable.

2964
02:05:11,180 --> 02:05:13,560
Like, I wanna like just walk off the cart.

2965
02:05:18,920 --> 02:05:20,440
There's the fucking tree.

2966
02:05:20,620 --> 02:05:21,280
There you go.

2967
02:05:22,160 --> 02:05:23,420
There's the tree.

2968
02:05:23,620 --> 02:05:24,820
Stand near the tree.

2969
02:05:25,280 --> 02:05:26,540
Stand near the tree.

2970
02:05:28,180 --> 02:05:29,420
Oh, thank god.

2971
02:05:29,480 --> 02:05:29,960
I'm out.

2972
02:05:30,400 --> 02:05:31,720
I'm out of this game.

2973
02:05:41,740 --> 02:05:43,280
Oh, my god.

2974
02:05:44,160 --> 02:05:45,280
Holy fuck.

2975
02:05:45,280 --> 02:05:46,340
You fooled me.

2976
02:05:46,340 --> 02:05:46,440
Oh, god.

2977
02:05:46,440 --> 02:05:50,420
Guys, I think... I think Overwatch might be the worst game.

2978
02:05:50,760 --> 02:05:51,380
I think...

2979
02:05:51,380 --> 02:05:58,340
I think Overwatch might be like one of the worst games right now.

2980
02:06:12,780 --> 02:06:16,400
True, but I can't stop playing.

2981
02:06:16,740 --> 02:06:18,000
That's the worst part.

2982
02:06:18,720 --> 02:06:21,840
Oh hey, it will not be placed on your team.

2983
02:06:22,260 --> 02:06:23,120
Players are normal.

2984
02:06:23,240 --> 02:06:24,820
Oh, they made a new thing for it.

2985
02:06:27,220 --> 02:06:28,320
That's actually awesome.

2986
02:06:28,340 --> 02:06:29,180
I like that a lot more.

2987
02:06:32,820 --> 02:06:33,960
Wait, where's mine?

2988
02:06:42,880 --> 02:06:45,480
Wait, can I avoid like 12 people now?

2989
02:06:46,060 --> 02:06:47,440
Oh no, this is pinned.

2990
02:06:48,340 --> 02:06:49,760
Wait, I thought I... Oh, okay.

2991
02:06:53,330 --> 02:06:54,050
It's okay.

2992
02:06:54,710 --> 02:06:55,410
It's okay.

2993
02:06:57,210 --> 02:06:59,770
They avoided me so I don't have to waste my avoid slots.

2994
02:07:05,930 --> 02:07:09,950
Guys, they avoided me so I don't have to waste my avoid slots.

2995
02:07:11,930 --> 02:07:12,450
Please.

2996
02:07:22,550 --> 02:07:23,750
Oh my god.

2997
02:07:24,890 --> 02:07:26,250
No, there's no way.

2998
02:07:26,470 --> 02:07:27,930
There's no way he didn't.

2999
02:07:27,990 --> 02:07:30,010
He played me and then just...

3000
02:07:30,010 --> 02:07:31,590
He played me.

3001
02:07:31,730 --> 02:07:33,370
I just killed a Juno!

3002
02:07:33,670 --> 02:07:34,710
Who is this?

3003
02:07:34,830 --> 02:07:36,150
Am I going to have to kill another Juno?

3004
02:07:36,150 --> 02:07:37,250
Oh, thank god you're not Juno.

3005
02:07:37,370 --> 02:07:38,670
I'm just happy you're not.

3006
02:07:38,670 --> 02:07:43,590
I literally killed a Juno and then another Juno popped out.

3007
02:07:44,610 --> 02:07:50,170
Guys, Overwatch may be really bad right now, but I can quit any time.

3008
02:07:50,350 --> 02:07:50,870
Chat.

3009
02:07:51,430 --> 02:07:54,130
Guys, I can quit any time.

3010
02:07:56,590 --> 02:07:59,230
Guys, I can quit any time.

3011
02:08:02,390 --> 02:08:02,710
I...

3012
02:08:03,470 --> 02:08:05,370
Why is it... Why?

3013
02:08:06,370 --> 02:08:08,210
I hate the Space Wars.

3014
02:08:08,210 --> 02:08:09,230
No time to waste.

3015
02:08:11,450 --> 02:08:16,130
Guys, I can... I can play other video... I can play other competitive games.

3016
02:08:16,990 --> 02:08:19,090
Well, I can't quit right now, guys.

3017
02:08:19,170 --> 02:08:20,190
I gotta get top 500.

3018
02:08:20,330 --> 02:08:21,490
We made a bet.

3019
02:08:21,910 --> 02:08:24,370
But like, after that, I can quit any time.

3020
02:08:25,290 --> 02:08:26,130
After that.

3021
02:08:27,590 --> 02:08:30,430
After that, I can quit any time I want.

3022
02:08:32,950 --> 02:08:36,490
Guys, I...

3023
02:08:37,350 --> 02:08:39,010
I don't have a problem.

3024
02:08:41,270 --> 02:08:43,610
I don't have a problem, guys.

3025
02:08:46,370 --> 02:08:47,010
No!

3026
02:08:48,490 --> 02:08:49,130
Yeah.

3027
02:08:52,330 --> 02:08:55,210
I can quit whenever I want, guys.

3028
02:08:57,310 --> 02:08:58,510
Oh, what the fuck?

3029
02:08:58,710 --> 02:09:00,130
Oh my god, and there's a Zenyatta?

3030
02:09:01,790 --> 02:09:02,430
Bro!

3031
02:09:02,430 --> 02:09:03,470
Fuck off!

3032
02:09:03,470 --> 02:09:03,770
Fuck off!

3033
02:09:05,850 --> 02:09:06,830
That's embarrassing.

3034
02:09:07,090 --> 02:09:07,370
Oh, here.

3035
02:09:07,430 --> 02:09:08,410
There's my tumbleweed.

3036
02:09:08,890 --> 02:09:10,650
That was embarrassing for that Juno.

3037
02:09:12,230 --> 02:09:13,170
Poor Tyler.

3038
02:09:15,730 --> 02:09:16,830
I can do it.

3039
02:09:19,810 --> 02:09:20,850
It's that easy.

3040
02:09:21,350 --> 02:09:22,990
Like... Like, I can do it.

3041
02:09:25,210 --> 02:09:25,710
Yeah, see?

3042
02:09:25,870 --> 02:09:27,050
I totally believe you.

3043
02:09:27,090 --> 02:09:27,250
Yeah!

3044
02:09:27,530 --> 02:09:28,170
Cause I can!

3045
02:09:29,210 --> 02:09:32,730
Bro, this Kiriko has been the bane of my existing... existence.

3046
02:09:34,210 --> 02:09:37,310
I finally killed her, but only because she was half HP.

3047
02:09:38,110 --> 02:09:41,550
I have not been able to kill this fucking Kiriko for so long.

3048
02:09:41,990 --> 02:09:42,830
My kill.

3049
02:09:42,990 --> 02:09:43,370
Yoink.

3050
02:09:45,110 --> 02:09:46,010
My kill.

3051
02:09:46,010 --> 02:09:46,370
Yoink.

3052
02:09:49,790 --> 02:09:50,750
My kill, too.

3053
02:09:55,910 --> 02:09:57,410
Oh, my kills.

3054
02:10:00,790 --> 02:10:01,270
My kills.

3055
02:10:01,270 --> 02:10:01,510
Oh.

3056
02:10:08,220 --> 02:10:08,920
My kills.

3057
02:10:09,260 --> 02:10:10,440
My kills.

3058
02:10:10,440 --> 02:10:10,820
Oh shit!

3059
02:10:12,260 --> 02:10:12,960
Oh, fuck.

3060
02:10:13,060 --> 02:10:13,300
Okay.

3061
02:10:13,920 --> 02:10:15,240
I'll just go back here.

3062
02:10:17,640 --> 02:10:18,480
Oh, my god.

3063
02:10:18,520 --> 02:10:18,980
I swear...

3064
02:10:18,980 --> 02:10:19,140
NO!

3065
02:10:20,240 --> 02:10:20,720
Yes!

3066
02:10:20,880 --> 02:10:21,160
Okay.

3067
02:10:21,400 --> 02:10:22,580
All right, finally.

3068
02:10:22,840 --> 02:10:24,620
I beat him with full merit.

3069
02:10:27,600 --> 02:10:29,440
I beat him with full merit.

3070
02:10:29,600 --> 02:10:29,980
Hey!

3071
02:10:30,160 --> 02:10:30,200
Oh, shit!

3072
02:10:30,200 --> 02:10:30,220
Oh, shit!

3073
02:10:34,140 --> 02:10:35,580
This is fucked up.

3074
02:10:38,620 --> 02:10:41,320
I can't believe he stole my kill!

3075
02:10:41,840 --> 02:10:44,100
Who would... what kind of fucked up person does that?

3076
02:10:46,360 --> 02:10:49,360
What kind of fucked up person would do that to somebody?

3077
02:10:54,240 --> 02:10:55,540
Somebody will show up.

3078
02:10:55,600 --> 02:10:56,400
Wait, I'm so fast.

3079
02:10:59,280 --> 02:11:01,040
Oh my god, I was so fast there.

3080
02:11:01,040 --> 02:11:03,160
I know they did that for the elf.

3081
02:11:03,580 --> 02:11:04,240
Watch this.

3082
02:11:13,200 --> 02:11:13,660
Damn.

3083
02:11:13,660 --> 02:11:14,540
Damn, that's fucked.

3084
02:11:14,620 --> 02:11:15,740
Who would ever steal kills?

3085
02:11:15,960 --> 02:11:17,460
Who would ever do such a thing?

3086
02:11:19,720 --> 02:11:20,700
That's so fucked.

3087
02:11:22,820 --> 02:11:23,560
Oh shit.

3088
02:11:23,760 --> 02:11:24,180
Okay.

3089
02:11:25,280 --> 02:11:26,860
Guys, I need you guys to chill.

3090
02:11:27,040 --> 02:11:28,660
Guys, I need you guys to chill.

3091
02:11:33,810 --> 02:11:34,270
What?!

3092
02:11:34,270 --> 02:11:35,290
I'm so fast!

3093
02:11:35,310 --> 02:11:35,510
That's unfair!

3094
02:11:36,850 --> 02:11:39,870
That's actually fan art.

3095
02:11:40,050 --> 02:11:40,590
Fair.

3096
02:11:43,970 --> 02:11:45,370
Oh my god.

3097
02:11:50,030 --> 02:11:52,130
How could they do this to me?

3098
02:11:52,370 --> 02:11:54,230
I made my mistakes.

3099
02:11:58,050 --> 02:11:59,250
Alright, let's see.

3100
02:12:02,170 --> 02:12:03,590
Life will be different now.

3101
02:12:07,490 --> 02:12:09,710
Life would be so diff- This is it.

3102
02:12:09,730 --> 02:12:11,890
This is the moment my luck changes.

3103
02:12:15,730 --> 02:12:16,450
This is it.

3104
02:12:19,670 --> 02:12:21,590
That's when you know I'm playing Mora.

3105
02:12:25,810 --> 02:12:26,930
My third...

3106
02:12:26,930 --> 02:12:28,710
He's shopping right now.

3107
02:12:30,350 --> 02:12:31,870
It's like, can you play take?

3108
02:12:32,210 --> 02:12:34,070
He was like, I'm outside.

3109
02:12:34,410 --> 02:12:35,610
I had to buy stuff.

3110
02:12:38,430 --> 02:12:39,490
I messaged the fourth.

3111
02:12:40,010 --> 02:12:42,290
I messaged the fourth, so we'll see.

3112
02:12:42,490 --> 02:12:45,470
We'll see if God likes me today.

3113
02:12:46,050 --> 02:12:48,390
I think today is just not my day.

3114
02:12:48,590 --> 02:12:49,230
I think.

3115
02:12:49,610 --> 02:12:50,230
I...

3116
02:12:50,230 --> 02:12:54,590
I think today is just not my day.

3117
02:12:54,810 --> 02:12:55,910
Not gonna lie.

3118
02:12:58,730 --> 02:13:00,270
It's just... How?

3119
02:13:02,050 --> 02:13:03,730
Oh my god.

3120
02:13:04,750 --> 02:13:05,910
It's not fair.

3121
02:13:06,110 --> 02:13:07,570
They gave me like...

3122
02:13:07,570 --> 02:13:10,430
What world was like with a good tank.

3123
02:13:10,710 --> 02:13:12,870
And now I don't know how to live.

3124
02:13:12,950 --> 02:13:14,470
Live like this anymore.

3125
02:13:15,170 --> 02:13:17,350
They gave me what life was like.

3126
02:13:17,610 --> 02:13:19,390
If my tanks were decent.

3127
02:13:19,750 --> 02:13:21,270
For like one game.

3128
02:13:21,990 --> 02:13:23,630
That's so cruel.

3129
02:13:24,290 --> 02:13:25,790
Life is so cruel.

3130
02:13:26,030 --> 02:13:27,990
And he's literally playing Orisa.

3131
02:13:28,090 --> 02:13:29,870
Which is like the doom counter.

3132
02:13:30,430 --> 02:13:31,730
Like that...

3133
02:13:31,730 --> 02:13:34,310
Life is so fucking cool, man.

3134
02:13:36,110 --> 02:13:36,950
He's low.

3135
02:13:37,050 --> 02:13:38,270
I was gonna say he lives.

3136
02:13:38,750 --> 02:13:40,530
He does not live.

3137
02:13:44,410 --> 02:13:45,010
Alright.

3138
02:13:48,920 --> 02:13:49,720
Let's see.

3139
02:13:51,420 --> 02:13:52,320
On him.

3140
02:13:52,580 --> 02:13:53,480
Genji, please.

3141
02:13:53,540 --> 02:13:54,220
Don't die.

3142
02:13:54,760 --> 02:13:55,660
Genji, please.

3143
02:13:55,820 --> 02:13:57,600
I don't have anything left.

3144
02:13:59,700 --> 02:14:00,680
Oh, dude.

3145
02:14:00,940 --> 02:14:03,420
Why are you fucking kidding me?

3146
02:14:03,500 --> 02:14:04,100
Dude.

3147
02:14:05,780 --> 02:14:05,880
Hahaha.

3148
02:14:07,960 --> 02:14:09,300
Oh, beyond point.

3149
02:14:11,720 --> 02:14:12,860
This is fucked.

3150
02:14:13,460 --> 02:14:13,980
Because...

3151
02:14:16,440 --> 02:14:16,960
Alright.

3152
02:14:18,700 --> 02:14:19,500
Alright, Juno.

3153
02:14:19,540 --> 02:14:20,660
You heal me, I heal you.

3154
02:14:23,260 --> 02:14:24,060
Alright, nice.

3155
02:14:24,200 --> 02:14:25,060
We did it, guys.

3156
02:14:25,540 --> 02:14:26,500
We did it.

3157
02:14:29,040 --> 02:14:29,560
Alright.

3158
02:14:30,880 --> 02:14:35,100
Remember this girl died to a stone baby 14 times in a row.

3159
02:14:35,180 --> 02:14:35,760
Remember this girl died to a stone baby 14 times in a row.

3160
02:14:35,760 --> 02:14:37,300
She literally killed a baby and couldn't even...

3161
02:14:37,300 --> 02:14:37,800
That's me.

3162
02:14:38,580 --> 02:14:39,400
That's me.

3163
02:14:40,440 --> 02:14:41,580
That's me, guys.

3164
02:14:42,520 --> 02:14:44,120
And I am not proud of it.

3165
02:14:44,740 --> 02:14:45,900
Fuck this guy.

3166
02:14:47,640 --> 02:14:48,540
Guys, please.

3167
02:14:48,600 --> 02:14:49,220
Move up.

3168
02:14:49,540 --> 02:14:50,100
Please.

3169
02:14:50,280 --> 02:14:51,460
I beg of you.

3170
02:14:51,920 --> 02:14:55,580
We double supported all and we didn't get anything?

3171
02:14:56,360 --> 02:14:56,920
Okay.

3172
02:14:57,780 --> 02:14:58,340
Hahaha.

3173
02:14:59,240 --> 02:14:59,660
Hahaha.

3174
02:15:01,500 --> 02:15:01,780
Okay.

3175
02:15:02,200 --> 02:15:04,640
Why did nobody moved up?

3176
02:15:04,640 --> 02:15:06,780
I don't understand.

3177
02:15:08,020 --> 02:15:10,140
Oh my God.

3178
02:15:14,470 --> 02:15:18,340
I don't understand why none of us moved up.

3179
02:15:20,390 --> 02:15:23,000
It's just not those days.

3180
02:15:31,770 --> 02:15:32,660
It'll be fine.

3181
02:15:34,580 --> 02:15:35,560
Nice.

3182
02:15:37,920 --> 02:15:38,120
Okay.

3183
02:15:39,020 --> 02:15:40,940
Sadly, that was not nice.

3184
02:15:44,060 --> 02:15:46,860
That was sadly not nice.

3185
02:15:49,660 --> 02:15:50,380
Please.

3186
02:15:50,380 --> 02:15:51,700
He's literally one.

3187
02:15:53,460 --> 02:15:54,180
Please.

3188
02:15:54,580 --> 02:15:56,360
Why am I on point?

3189
02:15:56,500 --> 02:15:57,860
I'm literally on a...

3190
02:15:58,820 --> 02:16:00,840
I'm just a fucking grandma.

3191
02:16:01,540 --> 02:16:04,460
Why would you do this to granny?

3192
02:16:05,400 --> 02:16:06,120
Hahaha.

3193
02:16:06,120 --> 02:16:06,400
Hahaha.

3194
02:16:14,460 --> 02:16:14,920
Alright.

3195
02:16:18,120 --> 02:16:19,040
Yeah?

3196
02:16:19,300 --> 02:16:20,260
He missed?

3197
02:16:21,320 --> 02:16:22,920
How do you miss?

3198
02:16:27,810 --> 02:16:28,550
Fuck this.

3199
02:16:28,630 --> 02:16:28,950
Okay.

3200
02:16:29,170 --> 02:16:30,070
Hahaha.

3201
02:16:32,010 --> 02:16:32,930
Alright.

3202
02:16:35,790 --> 02:16:36,710
Alright.

3203
02:16:37,870 --> 02:16:39,310
This is...

3204
02:16:40,670 --> 02:16:42,250
This is...

3205
02:16:42,250 --> 02:16:43,970
This is...

3206
02:16:43,970 --> 02:16:44,150
This is the game.

3207
02:16:44,450 --> 02:16:45,030
Hahaha.

3208
02:16:45,090 --> 02:16:46,170
This is...

3209
02:16:46,170 --> 02:16:46,810
Wait.

3210
02:16:46,990 --> 02:16:48,450
Has our Doom ever ulted?

3211
02:16:52,190 --> 02:16:53,150
Oops.

3212
02:16:53,450 --> 02:16:54,930
Here I go.

3213
02:16:56,570 --> 02:16:59,190
I can't even position myself.

3214
02:16:59,790 --> 02:17:01,690
Nobody's touching point.

3215
02:17:06,130 --> 02:17:07,090
Oh.

3216
02:17:07,130 --> 02:17:08,630
He has six...

3217
02:17:08,630 --> 02:17:09,430
Hahaha.

3218
02:17:13,530 --> 02:17:15,450
Holy fuck.

3219
02:17:15,790 --> 02:17:16,470
Oh.

3220
02:17:20,650 --> 02:17:22,050
Oh my god.

3221
02:17:26,390 --> 02:17:27,670
Holy shit.

3222
02:17:28,490 --> 02:17:29,130
Despair.

3223
02:17:29,970 --> 02:17:30,610
Despair.

3224
02:17:30,810 --> 02:17:32,170
This is full rank reset.

3225
02:17:32,310 --> 02:17:33,110
So I don't know.

3226
02:17:33,330 --> 02:17:34,510
Or half reset.

3227
02:17:34,990 --> 02:17:35,630
Hahaha.

3228
02:17:35,630 --> 02:17:36,450
I don't know.

3229
02:17:36,710 --> 02:17:37,250
Hahaha.

3230
02:17:37,390 --> 02:17:38,730
Oh my...

3231
02:17:38,730 --> 02:17:39,810
Hahaha.

3232
02:17:41,710 --> 02:17:43,730
Dude is 4-6.

3233
02:17:43,810 --> 02:17:45,670
Dude is playing Doomfist!

3234
02:17:45,830 --> 02:17:46,450
I can't believe it.

3235
02:17:46,450 --> 02:17:47,550
Dude is playing Doomfist against Orisa.

3236
02:17:48,570 --> 02:17:49,650
You know what's sad?

3237
02:17:49,970 --> 02:17:52,010
That guy I added never added me back.

3238
02:17:52,210 --> 02:17:53,570
Because I think he thinks I'm...

3239
02:17:54,390 --> 02:17:55,150
He's like...

3240
02:17:55,150 --> 02:17:55,610
Oh great.

3241
02:17:55,710 --> 02:17:55,970
Another.

3242
02:17:56,330 --> 02:17:56,450
Hahaha.

3243
02:17:58,450 --> 02:17:59,010
Oh.

3244
02:17:59,970 --> 02:18:00,610
You're 5.

3245
02:18:04,050 --> 02:18:05,010
You're 5.

3246
02:18:07,590 --> 02:18:08,470
Oh shit.

3247
02:18:08,670 --> 02:18:09,210
Sorry.

3248
02:18:12,150 --> 02:18:12,710
Oh.

3249
02:18:13,030 --> 02:18:15,090
He got saved from the fucking...

3250
02:18:15,090 --> 02:18:16,350
From the wall.

3251
02:18:16,450 --> 02:18:17,690
From the ceiling.

3252
02:18:17,870 --> 02:18:18,090
Okay.

3253
02:18:18,170 --> 02:18:21,050
I can finally fucking position myself now.

3254
02:18:21,410 --> 02:18:23,130
Thank fucking god.

3255
02:18:23,490 --> 02:18:23,690
Oh.

3256
02:18:23,890 --> 02:18:25,230
And now they have Sombra?

3257
02:18:26,470 --> 02:18:27,070
Yeah.

3258
02:18:27,130 --> 02:18:28,370
Fuck our Doom I guess.

3259
02:18:28,730 --> 02:18:29,650
Our Doom's not...

3260
02:18:29,650 --> 02:18:33,310
Let's have Doom not do anything even more.

3261
02:18:33,570 --> 02:18:34,130
Hahaha.

3262
02:18:34,230 --> 02:18:34,530
Hahaha.

3263
02:18:34,970 --> 02:18:36,750
Let's make sure he's never alive.

3264
02:18:37,330 --> 02:18:37,930
Hahaha.

3265
02:18:39,750 --> 02:18:40,330
Really?

3266
02:18:41,050 --> 02:18:43,270
There's no need to counter our Doom.

3267
02:18:43,450 --> 02:18:46,030
He counters himself perfectly fine.

3268
02:18:46,050 --> 02:18:46,430
Hahaha.

3269
02:18:46,450 --> 02:18:47,250
Like...

3270
02:18:49,830 --> 02:18:50,530
Why?

3271
02:18:51,730 --> 02:18:53,590
He literally counters himself.

3272
02:18:54,810 --> 02:18:57,030
Why did you blink away from the heals?

3273
02:19:03,330 --> 02:19:04,030
Fine.

3274
02:19:04,190 --> 02:19:05,570
I was not gonna live there.

3275
02:19:05,730 --> 02:19:06,830
I was literally...

3276
02:19:06,830 --> 02:19:07,770
Oh my god.

3277
02:19:07,810 --> 02:19:08,470
He finds...

3278
02:19:08,470 --> 02:19:09,630
He wins Zarya!

3279
02:19:10,230 --> 02:19:10,930
Hahaha.

3280
02:19:11,270 --> 02:19:12,830
He wins Zarya.

3281
02:19:13,010 --> 02:19:13,330
No.

3282
02:19:13,330 --> 02:19:14,830
This is counter swap.

3283
02:19:15,330 --> 02:19:18,030
It's team counter swap day.

3284
02:19:18,570 --> 02:19:19,270
No.

3285
02:19:19,290 --> 02:19:19,570
Hahaha.

3286
02:19:19,570 --> 02:19:20,190
No.

3287
02:19:20,190 --> 02:19:20,770
No.

3288
02:19:27,730 --> 02:19:30,410
They're gonna be counter swapping all day.

3289
02:19:34,570 --> 02:19:35,110
No.

3290
02:19:42,210 --> 02:19:42,750
Please.

3291
02:19:43,050 --> 02:19:43,970
Hit one shot.

3292
02:19:44,070 --> 02:19:44,870
Hit one hook.

3293
02:19:45,010 --> 02:19:45,990
That's all I want.

3294
02:19:46,050 --> 02:19:46,330
You know what?

3295
02:19:46,410 --> 02:19:46,790
Fuck it.

3296
02:19:47,610 --> 02:19:48,630
Fuck it.

3297
02:19:49,230 --> 02:19:49,770
Believe.

3298
02:19:54,100 --> 02:19:54,740
I believe.

3299
02:19:54,740 --> 02:19:54,900
I believe.

3300
02:19:54,900 --> 02:19:55,620
Oh god.

3301
02:19:55,700 --> 02:19:56,720
I don't believe anymore.

3302
02:19:57,140 --> 02:19:57,660
Alright.

3303
02:19:57,820 --> 02:19:58,680
We have Pharah.

3304
02:19:58,980 --> 02:19:59,540
Okay.

3305
02:19:59,640 --> 02:20:00,340
Here we go.

3306
02:20:00,540 --> 02:20:01,000
Hahaha.

3307
02:20:01,120 --> 02:20:02,420
It's pharmacy time.

3308
02:20:03,380 --> 02:20:03,940
Hahaha.

3309
02:20:04,740 --> 02:20:05,560
It's pharmacy.

3310
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:07,700
Why did he blink D.Va?

3311
02:20:08,620 --> 02:20:10,660
He couldn't blink D.Va.

3312
02:20:10,860 --> 02:20:11,420
Hahaha.

3313
02:20:11,620 --> 02:20:13,340
He doesn't even hit hooks.

3314
02:20:13,620 --> 02:20:14,080
Hahaha.

3315
02:20:14,820 --> 02:20:15,820
You don't...

3316
02:20:15,820 --> 02:20:16,200
Oh.

3317
02:20:16,280 --> 02:20:16,700
I didn't...

3318
02:20:16,700 --> 02:20:17,200
You're gonna...

3319
02:20:17,200 --> 02:20:17,360
Oh.

3320
02:20:17,380 --> 02:20:17,680
Okay.

3321
02:20:17,880 --> 02:20:18,300
Alright.

3322
02:20:18,480 --> 02:20:20,300
We're all counter swapping today.

3323
02:20:20,420 --> 02:20:20,900
I see.

3324
02:20:21,200 --> 02:20:22,740
Let's all counter swap.

3325
02:20:22,860 --> 02:20:23,740
It's really like...

3326
02:20:23,740 --> 02:20:24,440
With a whole...

3327
02:20:24,440 --> 02:20:26,460
Maybe we should even swap Juno.

3328
02:20:26,580 --> 02:20:28,060
Maybe Juno is the problem.

3329
02:20:28,340 --> 02:20:29,560
We swapped everything.

3330
02:20:30,080 --> 02:20:30,600
Hahaha.

3331
02:20:31,920 --> 02:20:32,440
Hahaha.

3332
02:20:33,720 --> 02:20:34,240
Guys.

3333
02:20:34,440 --> 02:20:35,540
Maybe Juno is...

3334
02:20:35,540 --> 02:20:36,420
Oh my...

3335
02:20:36,420 --> 02:20:36,660
No.

3336
02:20:39,200 --> 02:20:40,920
Maybe Juno is the problem.

3337
02:20:41,300 --> 02:20:42,260
They have no tank.

3338
02:20:42,340 --> 02:20:42,600
No tank.

3339
02:20:46,340 --> 02:20:46,860
Please.

3340
02:20:49,840 --> 02:20:51,140
I will use this.

3341
02:20:51,200 --> 02:20:53,160
I don't trust my entire team anymore.

3342
02:20:53,620 --> 02:20:54,420
Roll dice.

3343
02:20:54,440 --> 02:20:54,620
Oh my god.

3344
02:20:55,040 --> 02:20:56,600
The first hook he's got.

3345
02:20:58,520 --> 02:21:01,960
I am trying my best to make sure you don't die.

3346
02:21:02,120 --> 02:21:03,200
Oh my god.

3347
02:21:03,220 --> 02:21:05,260
He actually hit a hook.

3348
02:21:05,620 --> 02:21:07,540
Oh my god.

3349
02:21:07,780 --> 02:21:09,460
It doesn't matter though.

3350
02:21:09,840 --> 02:21:10,420
Hahaha.

3351
02:21:10,520 --> 02:21:12,100
It actually doesn't matter.

3352
02:21:12,520 --> 02:21:13,080
Hahaha.

3353
02:21:14,880 --> 02:21:16,360
Oh my god.

3354
02:21:18,180 --> 02:21:18,900
Oh.

3355
02:21:19,480 --> 02:21:20,200
Guys.

3356
02:21:23,340 --> 02:21:24,060
Guys.

3357
02:21:24,120 --> 02:21:24,420
We win.

3358
02:21:24,420 --> 02:21:24,900
We would win a game.

3359
02:21:24,900 --> 02:21:25,700
We will win a game.

3360
02:21:25,820 --> 02:21:26,500
I believe.

3361
02:21:26,860 --> 02:21:27,160
Hahaha.

3362
02:21:27,260 --> 02:21:28,000
I believe.

3363
02:21:28,680 --> 02:21:29,160
Hahaha.

3364
02:21:30,020 --> 02:21:30,980
Jesus Christ.

3365
02:21:31,260 --> 02:21:31,620
Hahaha.

3366
02:21:31,860 --> 02:21:33,180
We will win a game.

3367
02:21:33,500 --> 02:21:34,240
We will.

3368
02:21:34,360 --> 02:21:34,880
I believe.

3369
02:21:35,100 --> 02:21:35,580
Hahaha.

3370
02:21:36,100 --> 02:21:37,480
It can't be that bad.

3371
02:21:37,760 --> 02:21:37,960
Hahaha.

3372
02:21:38,040 --> 02:21:38,980
There's no way.

3373
02:21:39,320 --> 02:21:39,800
Hahaha.

3374
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:41,120
Next game will be better.

3375
02:21:41,480 --> 02:21:41,960
Hahaha.

3376
02:21:42,660 --> 02:21:43,380
Oh hey.

3377
02:21:43,560 --> 02:21:44,480
You don't hit...

3378
02:21:44,480 --> 02:21:44,680
Oh.

3379
02:21:44,840 --> 02:21:45,140
Alright.

3380
02:21:45,700 --> 02:21:46,180
Hey.

3381
02:21:46,300 --> 02:21:46,620
Hog.

3382
02:21:46,800 --> 02:21:47,280
Hog.

3383
02:21:47,480 --> 02:21:47,820
You don't...

3384
02:21:47,820 --> 02:21:49,540
You don't wanna walk up?

3385
02:21:50,500 --> 02:21:52,340
You don't wanna walk up?

3386
02:21:52,600 --> 02:21:52,920
Hahaha.

3387
02:21:52,920 --> 02:21:53,160
Oh.

3388
02:21:53,280 --> 02:21:53,680
Okay.

3389
02:21:54,560 --> 02:21:55,120
I...

3390
02:21:55,120 --> 02:21:55,780
Hahaha.

3391
02:21:59,880 --> 02:22:00,440
Oh.

3392
02:22:00,640 --> 02:22:00,900
Okay.

3393
02:22:00,960 --> 02:22:01,980
He's playing tank now.

3394
02:22:02,200 --> 02:22:02,660
Hahaha.

3395
02:22:05,460 --> 02:22:05,980
Hahaha.

3396
02:22:06,360 --> 02:22:06,920
Hahaha.

3397
02:22:06,920 --> 02:22:07,800
We're at this point.

3398
02:22:07,940 --> 02:22:09,040
Why are we...

3399
02:22:09,040 --> 02:22:10,120
Hahaha.

3400
02:22:10,940 --> 02:22:11,180
Hahaha.

3401
02:22:11,280 --> 02:22:11,620
Hahaha.

3402
02:22:11,660 --> 02:22:12,220
Hahaha.

3403
02:22:12,220 --> 02:22:12,440
Maybe...

3404
02:22:12,440 --> 02:22:15,480
Maybe I'll message a DPS player and see him there.

3405
02:22:15,700 --> 02:22:16,000
Hahaha.

3406
02:22:16,840 --> 02:22:17,400
Hahaha.

3407
02:22:18,160 --> 02:22:18,720
Hahaha.

3408
02:22:18,720 --> 02:22:18,880
Hahaha.

3409
02:22:18,880 --> 02:22:18,920
Hahaha.

3410
02:22:18,920 --> 02:22:19,200
Hahaha.

3411
02:22:19,200 --> 02:22:19,220
Hahaha.

3412
02:22:20,020 --> 02:22:20,580
Hahaha.

3413
02:22:20,780 --> 02:22:21,340
Hahaha.

3414
02:22:21,340 --> 02:22:21,660
Hahaha.

3415
02:22:21,660 --> 02:22:25,100
Maybe message another DPS player.

3416
02:22:25,760 --> 02:22:26,460
Hahaha.

3417
02:22:28,400 --> 02:22:29,860
Oh my god.

3418
02:22:31,700 --> 02:22:33,100
Holy shit.

3419
02:22:33,320 --> 02:22:33,640
No.

3420
02:22:33,760 --> 02:22:34,280
It hurts.

3421
02:22:34,720 --> 02:22:35,800
It actually hurts.

3422
02:22:36,420 --> 02:22:37,120
Hahaha.

3423
02:22:38,120 --> 02:22:38,820
Hahaha.

3424
02:22:42,540 --> 02:22:44,500
Do Overwatch players feel joy?

3425
02:22:44,640 --> 02:22:44,820
No.

3426
02:22:44,900 --> 02:22:45,620
Of course not.

3427
02:22:45,900 --> 02:22:46,240
Hahaha.

3428
02:22:46,300 --> 02:22:49,500
I really think they're happy playing this.

3429
02:22:49,720 --> 02:22:49,980
Hahaha.

3430
02:22:50,060 --> 02:22:50,740
Hahaha.

3431
02:22:50,740 --> 02:22:51,320
Hahaha.

3432
02:22:52,720 --> 02:22:54,720
It's just a toxic relationship.

3433
02:22:54,880 --> 02:22:56,160
We just can't leave.

3434
02:22:56,600 --> 02:22:58,320
We can't fucking leave.

3435
02:22:58,600 --> 02:22:59,080
Hahaha.

3436
02:23:02,780 --> 02:23:03,760
It's been a lot.

3437
02:23:03,920 --> 02:23:05,040
It's cause like we...

3438
02:23:05,040 --> 02:23:06,560
We used to be really happy.

3439
02:23:07,500 --> 02:23:09,060
We used to be really happy.

3440
02:23:09,320 --> 02:23:13,660
And then we're always trying to chase that high of what it was like when we were happy.

3441
02:23:13,960 --> 02:23:14,760
So like...

3442
02:23:14,760 --> 02:23:16,860
We're always like maybe it'll be different this time.

3443
02:23:17,040 --> 02:23:17,360
You know?

3444
02:23:17,980 --> 02:23:20,220
Maybe like this time it'll be different.

3445
02:23:20,320 --> 02:23:21,220
And then like...

3446
02:23:21,220 --> 02:23:21,300
Yeah.

3447
02:23:21,300 --> 02:23:21,800
You start...

3448
02:23:21,800 --> 02:23:22,400
Like...

3449
02:23:23,160 --> 02:23:23,420
Like...

3450
02:23:23,420 --> 02:23:25,900
You try to chase that same happiness again.

3451
02:23:26,160 --> 02:23:26,580
You know?

3452
02:23:33,000 --> 02:23:33,520
Hahaha.

3453
02:23:33,600 --> 02:23:34,460
You're just...

3454
02:23:34,460 --> 02:23:35,400
You're just like...

3455
02:23:35,400 --> 02:23:36,740
It'll be different this time.

3456
02:23:36,800 --> 02:23:37,520
I'm gonna get ice cream.

3457
02:23:37,580 --> 02:23:38,060
I can't.

3458
02:23:38,060 --> 02:23:38,660
I'll be right back.

3459
02:23:38,880 --> 02:23:39,800
I can't.

3460
02:23:39,800 --> 02:23:41,200
I can't keep doing it.

3461
02:24:48,920 --> 02:24:49,880
There's no way.

3462
02:24:50,120 --> 02:24:50,880
There's no way.

3463
02:24:50,960 --> 02:24:51,240
This...

3464
02:24:51,240 --> 02:24:52,700
This game will be different.

3465
02:24:53,100 --> 02:24:54,020
There's no way.

3466
02:24:54,160 --> 02:24:55,380
I have ice cream now.

3467
02:24:55,460 --> 02:24:56,320
There's no fucking way.

3468
02:24:56,620 --> 02:24:57,140
I...

3469
02:24:57,140 --> 02:24:57,620
Hahaha.

3470
02:24:58,180 --> 02:24:58,700
Hahaha.

3471
02:24:59,280 --> 02:24:59,800
Hahaha.

3472
02:25:00,240 --> 02:25:00,320
Hahaha.

3473
02:25:00,320 --> 02:25:00,680
Hahaha.

3474
02:25:00,680 --> 02:25:01,120
Hahaha.

3475
02:25:02,660 --> 02:25:04,520
There's no fucking way.

3476
02:25:07,020 --> 02:25:08,580
I have ice cream now.

3477
02:25:08,780 --> 02:25:09,520
Things will be...

3478
02:25:09,520 --> 02:25:10,680
Things are looking up.

3479
02:25:11,160 --> 02:25:12,740
Things are looking up now.

3480
02:25:15,140 --> 02:25:15,880
Oh, hey.

3481
02:25:16,660 --> 02:25:17,220
Okay.

3482
02:25:19,660 --> 02:25:20,220
Hmm.

3483
02:25:21,440 --> 02:25:22,520
I have Moki.

3484
02:25:26,100 --> 02:25:26,660
Hmm.

3485
02:25:31,420 --> 02:25:31,980
Hmm.

3486
02:25:42,690 --> 02:25:43,250
Oh.

3487
02:25:43,270 --> 02:25:43,710
Hahaha.

3488
02:25:43,850 --> 02:25:44,390
Hahaha.

3489
02:25:44,390 --> 02:25:44,730
Hahaha.

3490
02:25:47,920 --> 02:25:49,700
I will be the problem.

3491
02:25:49,980 --> 02:25:50,380
Hahaha!

3492
02:25:52,500 --> 02:25:53,260
Hahaha!

3493
02:25:53,260 --> 02:25:53,780
Hahaha!

3494
02:25:55,300 --> 02:25:58,720
I'm gonna be the reason why we live now.

3495
02:25:59,400 --> 02:26:00,160
Hahaha!

3496
02:26:01,880 --> 02:26:02,640
Hahaha!

3497
02:26:03,480 --> 02:26:03,920
Hahaha!

3498
02:26:05,600 --> 02:26:06,360
haha!

3499
02:26:07,160 --> 02:26:07,240
Hahaha!

3500
02:26:07,240 --> 02:26:07,420
Hahaha!

3501
02:26:07,720 --> 02:26:08,480
Haha!

3502
02:26:08,480 --> 02:26:11,320
Be the problem so no one else can be defined.

3503
02:26:11,380 --> 02:26:12,020
Hahaha!

3504
02:26:12,020 --> 02:26:12,660
Hahaha!

3505
02:26:13,320 --> 02:26:14,080
Hahaha!

3506
02:26:14,080 --> 02:26:14,400
Hahaha!

3507
02:26:15,620 --> 02:26:16,380
Hahaha!

3508
02:26:16,380 --> 02:26:17,600
I remember this place.

3509
02:26:17,720 --> 02:26:20,940
I know this is where I learned not to drink soy sauce.

3510
02:26:25,930 --> 02:26:27,410
Alright, here we go.

3511
02:26:43,140 --> 02:26:45,600
Alright, if I'm the problem...

3512
02:26:48,930 --> 02:26:53,990
If I'm the problem, then like... then you can blame me.

3513
02:26:59,410 --> 02:27:01,290
We tried so hard.

3514
02:27:01,850 --> 02:27:03,430
We tried so hard.

3515
02:27:06,190 --> 02:27:07,410
Oh shit!

3516
02:27:09,910 --> 02:27:11,210
I might be dead.

3517
02:27:11,970 --> 02:27:13,510
Oh, oh no!

3518
02:27:15,290 --> 02:27:15,970
Okay.

3519
02:27:16,630 --> 02:27:19,710
Okay, now that I took Juno from everybody...

3520
02:27:20,430 --> 02:27:23,130
Now that I took Juno from everybody...

3521
02:27:23,130 --> 02:27:25,950
They won't... nobody can pick Juno now.

3522
02:27:30,570 --> 02:27:33,310
Now that I took Juno...

3523
02:27:35,070 --> 02:27:35,670
Now...

3524
02:27:36,370 --> 02:27:38,150
They cannot take Juno.

3525
02:27:42,510 --> 02:27:44,230
That was my plan all along.

3526
02:27:45,550 --> 02:27:47,310
That was how we're gonna do it.

3527
02:27:49,810 --> 02:27:50,990
Oh shit!

3528
02:27:56,580 --> 02:27:58,640
Please, Bat, please turn around!

3529
02:28:01,620 --> 02:28:03,180
Please get the turret!

3530
02:28:04,620 --> 02:28:06,060
There we go, we figured it out.

3531
02:28:06,300 --> 02:28:07,980
I take Juno first...

3532
02:28:07,980 --> 02:28:09,640
I die with Juno...

3533
02:28:09,640 --> 02:28:10,780
And then I swap.

3534
02:28:11,240 --> 02:28:12,580
We figured it out.

3535
02:28:13,840 --> 02:28:15,800
We fixed the problem.

3536
02:28:16,140 --> 02:28:16,720
We...

3537
02:28:16,720 --> 02:28:19,680
We fixed it.

3538
02:28:20,200 --> 02:28:22,480
This is how we fix Overwatch.

3539
02:28:23,890 --> 02:28:25,880
I cracked the code.

3540
02:28:31,870 --> 02:28:34,090
It's okay, I fixed the problem.

3541
02:28:38,800 --> 02:28:40,220
He has shatter.

3542
02:28:41,700 --> 02:28:42,110
Like...

3543
02:28:43,500 --> 02:28:44,580
There we go.

3544
02:28:45,980 --> 02:28:46,920
Problem solved.

3545
02:28:48,240 --> 02:28:51,320
I fixed the problem by becoming the problem.

3546
02:28:51,720 --> 02:28:53,420
That's how you do these things.

3547
02:28:53,720 --> 02:28:54,100
Oh god.

3548
02:28:58,100 --> 02:28:59,300
Can they touch it?

3549
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:01,000
No, they can't.

3550
02:29:01,040 --> 02:29:01,580
Oh!

3551
02:29:01,940 --> 02:29:03,420
They wasted ult too!

3552
02:29:04,100 --> 02:29:06,340
Technically, they didn't waste ult because...

3553
02:29:10,240 --> 02:29:12,720
Technically, they don't because they can still snowball this.

3554
02:29:14,520 --> 02:29:15,600
Oh, they can't anymore.

3555
02:29:16,060 --> 02:29:16,600
Wow!

3556
02:29:21,830 --> 02:29:22,890
There's another door...

3557
02:29:28,040 --> 02:29:28,500
Alright.

3558
02:29:29,740 --> 02:29:30,900
Yeah, but if I...

3559
02:29:30,900 --> 02:29:32,620
If I die before...

3560
02:29:33,260 --> 02:29:34,940
After the bat, it'll be fine.

3561
02:29:35,080 --> 02:29:36,240
Oh, I don't think we can make it.

3562
02:29:36,420 --> 02:29:37,900
Can we make it to the other side?

3563
02:29:38,560 --> 02:29:40,140
They like push this so far.

3564
02:29:41,560 --> 02:29:42,520
Oh shi...

3565
02:29:42,520 --> 02:29:42,820
Okay.

3566
02:29:43,540 --> 02:29:45,960
But we have ult though, so...

3567
02:29:45,960 --> 02:29:46,700
Oh, nevermind.

3568
02:29:47,020 --> 02:29:48,380
No, they definitely got this.

3569
02:29:51,800 --> 02:29:53,180
Oh, they snowballed us.

3570
02:29:53,300 --> 02:29:53,600
No, they snowballed us.

3571
02:29:53,600 --> 02:29:53,700
Oh, we can't win.

3572
02:29:53,960 --> 02:29:53,980
We're doing it.

3573
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:54,020
I'm a pro.

3574
02:29:59,940 --> 02:30:00,920
Oh, no.

3575
02:30:01,060 --> 02:30:02,780
Oh, no, we're staggered now.

3576
02:30:02,940 --> 02:30:04,740
Oh, no.

3577
02:30:07,540 --> 02:30:09,580
Oh, no, we're staggered now.

3578
02:30:09,720 --> 02:30:09,900
No!

3579
02:30:10,120 --> 02:30:11,360
He went judo!

3580
02:30:17,120 --> 02:30:17,780
No!

3581
02:30:17,780 --> 02:30:18,440
No!

3582
02:30:22,800 --> 02:30:23,460
No!

3583
02:30:23,640 --> 02:30:25,500
He went judo!

3584
02:30:27,200 --> 02:30:28,940
That's not what's supposed

3585
02:30:37,890 --> 02:30:38,510
to...

3586
02:30:38,510 --> 02:30:39,370
Oh, no.

3587
02:30:39,650 --> 02:30:42,730
The Avenger booted me into them even more.

3588
02:30:45,430 --> 02:30:46,150
No!

3589
02:30:46,150 --> 02:30:48,670
You're not supposed to be judo!

3590
02:30:48,770 --> 02:30:50,430
I thought I fixed it!

3591
02:30:55,530 --> 02:30:58,470
How did I not fix the problem?

3592
02:31:00,290 --> 02:31:02,270
Julius took over.

3593
02:31:05,310 --> 02:31:07,450
No, we still... there's still hope.

3594
02:31:13,030 --> 02:31:13,450
Okay.

3595
02:31:13,450 --> 02:31:14,730
Okay, I was scared.

3596
02:31:14,950 --> 02:31:16,210
I was so scared.

3597
02:31:22,270 --> 02:31:23,150
Alright, nice.

3598
02:31:24,250 --> 02:31:25,570
God, I hate Clash.

3599
02:31:30,290 --> 02:31:33,490
Ooh, that was a good anti, though.

3600
02:31:34,150 --> 02:31:40,170
Are you fu... Oh, God, I thought he was gonna let his shield down because he was gonna do a... do that.

3601
02:31:40,550 --> 02:31:41,070
No!

3602
02:31:44,790 --> 02:31:49,730
I thought he was gonna let these... I thought he was gonna fucking swing his hammer first.

3603
02:31:50,370 --> 02:31:50,970
Alright.

3604
02:31:52,250 --> 02:31:53,070
It's okay.

3605
02:31:53,590 --> 02:31:54,430
We're fine.

3606
02:31:54,610 --> 02:31:56,530
I might be getting bullied, but we're okay.

3607
02:31:57,330 --> 02:31:59,110
Our team is doing great.

3608
02:32:04,260 --> 02:32:06,680
A091842... wait, is that... is that Aimbot Calvin?

3609
02:32:08,860 --> 02:32:10,820
Is that Aimbot Calvin?

3610
02:32:10,820 --> 02:32:10,960
Is that Aimbot Calvin?

3611
02:32:12,640 --> 02:32:16,140
That's... he's the only one that I know that has this username, or if that's a troll.

3612
02:32:24,680 --> 02:32:25,560
Oh, goodbye.

3613
02:32:26,820 --> 02:32:27,260
Yay!

3614
02:32:31,240 --> 02:32:31,680
Okay.

3615
02:32:33,080 --> 02:32:34,140
I gotta reload.

3616
02:32:34,340 --> 02:32:35,000
I gotta reload.

3617
02:32:35,120 --> 02:32:35,540
I'm sorry.

3618
02:32:38,840 --> 02:32:39,620
He missed!

3619
02:32:39,720 --> 02:32:40,020
He missed!

3620
02:32:40,640 --> 02:32:41,540
And he's anti!

3621
02:32:45,360 --> 02:32:45,900
He's won!

3622
02:32:47,360 --> 02:32:48,400
Go do the thing!

3623
02:32:53,940 --> 02:32:54,640
He's anti!

3624
02:32:56,480 --> 02:32:57,600
He's anti!

3625
02:32:57,600 --> 02:32:58,340
Shoot him!

3626
02:32:59,860 --> 02:33:01,280
Oh, my God, we did it.

3627
02:33:01,540 --> 02:33:02,940
We fucking did it.

3628
02:33:03,180 --> 02:33:09,140
Oh, my God.

3629
02:33:09,680 --> 02:33:11,760
Oh, my God, we fucking did it.

3630
02:33:15,520 --> 02:33:17,780
Holy shit, that's all we needed.

3631
02:33:17,940 --> 02:33:21,100
We need an actual tank.

3632
02:33:21,100 --> 02:33:21,540
We need an actual tank player.

3633
02:33:21,860 --> 02:33:23,120
We need...

3634
02:33:25,640 --> 02:33:26,760
Holy fuck.

3635
02:33:28,700 --> 02:33:29,920
Oh, my God.

3636
02:33:30,040 --> 02:33:32,880
We just needed a fucking human being.

3637
02:33:34,800 --> 02:33:36,020
I'm gonna keep doing that.

3638
02:33:36,160 --> 02:33:38,460
I'm gonna pick Juno, and then I'm gonna swap off.

3639
02:33:38,740 --> 02:33:42,180
And we're just gonna have the Ice Cream Titus thing.

3640
02:33:45,340 --> 02:33:46,780
That's all I needed.

3641
02:33:47,320 --> 02:33:49,820
That's all I fucking needed in life.

3642
02:33:52,560 --> 02:33:53,620
Oh, my God.

3643
02:33:56,140 --> 02:33:57,700
We cracked the system.

3644
02:33:58,940 --> 02:34:00,520
We cracked the system.

3645
02:34:08,260 --> 02:34:08,700
Okay.

3646
02:34:11,940 --> 02:34:13,120
I cracked the code.

3647
02:34:13,260 --> 02:34:14,040
The Ice Cream Buff.

3648
02:34:14,100 --> 02:34:15,960
I should've just had Ice Cream in the beginning.

3649
02:34:16,500 --> 02:34:16,940
Honestly.

3650
02:34:17,880 --> 02:34:19,960
I should've just had Ice Cream in the beginning.

3651
02:34:20,140 --> 02:34:20,500
Please.

3652
02:34:21,820 --> 02:34:22,660
Oh, my God.

3653
02:34:22,700 --> 02:34:22,940
Please.

3654
02:34:22,940 --> 02:34:23,680
I hope...

3655
02:34:23,680 --> 02:34:25,900
I hope you never find happiness.

3656
02:34:26,420 --> 02:34:35,680
I fucking know you're coming here.

3657
02:34:36,680 --> 02:34:37,900
Oh, my God.

3658
02:34:38,200 --> 02:34:39,540
I hope you...

3659
02:34:40,540 --> 02:34:42,540
I hope you stub your toe.

3660
02:34:46,800 --> 02:34:48,100
I think deserved.

3661
02:34:48,580 --> 02:34:50,500
Actually deserved.

3662
02:34:51,280 --> 02:34:53,440
That match made me a lot happier.

3663
02:34:53,440 --> 02:34:56,440
That actually made me a lot happier.

3664
02:34:56,580 --> 02:34:59,580
Why do I always bump into you?

3665
02:35:03,540 --> 02:35:04,820
It's actually...

3666
02:35:04,820 --> 02:35:05,720
That's fucked.

3667
02:35:06,020 --> 02:35:07,800
That is so fucked.

3668
02:35:07,880 --> 02:35:09,980
I wanna fight other people.

3669
02:35:10,940 --> 02:35:13,500
There's so many other people in this world.

3670
02:35:13,820 --> 02:35:14,920
Oh, thank God he left.

3671
02:35:15,120 --> 02:35:15,780
Thank God.

3672
02:35:22,190 --> 02:35:23,610
Are you really...

3673
02:35:23,610 --> 02:35:24,370
Are you serious?

3674
02:35:24,710 --> 02:35:25,230
I...

3675
02:35:25,230 --> 02:35:29,830
Why do I keep bumping into either the Orisa or the Venture?

3676
02:35:29,930 --> 02:35:31,550
Can I fight real people?

3677
02:35:32,030 --> 02:35:32,590
Can I...

3678
02:35:32,590 --> 02:35:35,770
Can I fight real people?

3679
02:35:38,130 --> 02:35:39,190
Oh, my...

3680
02:35:39,190 --> 02:35:40,210
Thank fucking God.

3681
02:35:40,270 --> 02:35:42,510
The one time I fight a real person.

3682
02:35:42,710 --> 02:35:46,430
The one time I fight a human being.

3683
02:35:51,010 --> 02:35:52,210
Oh, my God.

3684
02:35:53,790 --> 02:35:54,910
That's actually...

3685
02:35:55,910 --> 02:35:57,010
Jesus Christ.

3686
02:35:57,050 --> 02:35:58,450
What the fuck are you doing?

3687
02:36:02,070 --> 02:36:04,970
The one time I fight a real person.

3688
02:36:06,910 --> 02:36:07,850
What the fuck?

3689
02:36:07,850 --> 02:36:08,530
I hear footsteps.

3690
02:36:08,950 --> 02:36:09,510
Fuck you!

3691
02:36:09,530 --> 02:36:10,710
Stop pepper spraying me!

3692
02:36:11,870 --> 02:36:12,750
You're bad!

3693
02:36:14,590 --> 02:36:15,710
Keep pepper spraying!

3694
02:36:15,970 --> 02:36:17,030
You're not gonna kill me!

3695
02:36:17,450 --> 02:36:18,710
Oh, maybe she is.

3696
02:36:22,210 --> 02:36:23,350
I think she might actually.

3697
02:36:23,950 --> 02:36:24,710
JK.

3698
02:36:25,830 --> 02:36:26,730
Come on!

3699
02:36:31,970 --> 02:36:33,070
Fucking right!

3700
02:36:33,350 --> 02:36:34,490
There you go!

3701
02:36:34,610 --> 02:36:35,250
Are you happy?

3702
02:36:35,490 --> 02:36:36,750
Are you happy?

3703
02:36:40,570 --> 02:36:42,930
Are you fucking happy?

3704
02:36:49,640 --> 02:36:50,400
Okay.

3705
02:36:50,580 --> 02:36:51,780
Okay, bitch.

3706
02:36:57,300 --> 02:36:58,060
Okay.

3707
02:36:58,440 --> 02:36:59,080
Okay.

3708
02:36:59,740 --> 02:37:00,500
Okay.

3709
02:37:00,500 --> 02:37:01,560
Oh, wait.

3710
02:37:01,560 --> 02:37:02,700
You're not entertained.

3711
02:37:04,580 --> 02:37:08,460
Oh, at least he's not playing Juno.

3712
02:37:08,660 --> 02:37:09,340
That's...

3713
02:37:11,960 --> 02:37:13,880
Oh, my God, from...

3714
02:37:14,500 --> 02:37:15,000
from...

3715
02:37:15,000 --> 02:37:17,040
from Clash to Push.

3716
02:37:20,340 --> 02:37:21,140
Alright.

3717
02:37:21,340 --> 02:37:21,840
Are you...

3718
02:37:26,960 --> 02:37:27,760
The...

3719
02:37:30,420 --> 02:37:32,220
They got tricked.

3720
02:37:32,560 --> 02:37:33,480
Are you fucking...

3721
02:37:33,480 --> 02:37:35,580
Oh my god, fucking a trick.

3722
02:37:40,880 --> 02:37:45,980
I can't believe they fucking tricked me.

3723
02:37:46,200 --> 02:37:48,500
I let my guard down.

3724
02:37:49,170 --> 02:37:52,560
I let my guard down for one second.

3725
02:37:53,060 --> 02:37:55,900
For one fucking a second.

3726
02:37:59,120 --> 02:38:02,080
I was like, he didn't pick Juno!

3727
02:38:02,080 --> 02:38:04,540
I didn't have to insta-lock Juno!

3728
02:38:06,340 --> 02:38:10,220
The fact that he didn't insta-lock Juno and I was like...

3729
02:38:16,100 --> 02:38:17,380
Don't have to worry.

3730
02:38:17,860 --> 02:38:19,180
What the fuck, Reaper?

3731
02:38:19,400 --> 02:38:20,420
Right off the bat?

3732
02:38:22,800 --> 02:38:24,820
Jesus Christ, that poor guy.

3733
02:38:29,030 --> 02:38:30,930
Will you heal me, Juno?

3734
02:38:31,270 --> 02:38:33,330
No, you just wanna be...

3735
02:38:33,830 --> 02:38:34,430
That's fine.

3736
02:38:36,670 --> 02:38:38,610
That's fine, I don't...

3737
02:38:40,630 --> 02:38:42,890
I don't need to be healed, guys.

3738
02:38:46,530 --> 02:38:47,070
Here we go.

3739
02:38:47,610 --> 02:38:48,010
Please.

3740
02:38:48,830 --> 02:38:49,930
Please, no.

3741
02:38:50,070 --> 02:38:50,550
Please.

3742
02:38:51,550 --> 02:38:52,350
Please.

3743
02:38:55,510 --> 02:38:56,450
SHOOT ME!

3744
02:38:57,370 --> 02:38:58,170
Hahahaha!

3745
02:39:00,810 --> 02:39:01,210
Hahahaha!

3746
02:39:02,330 --> 02:39:03,130
Hahahaha!

3747
02:39:04,670 --> 02:39:05,230
Okay.

3748
02:39:05,590 --> 02:39:06,430
It's fine.

3749
02:39:06,610 --> 02:39:07,290
It's fine.

3750
02:39:08,190 --> 02:39:09,050
It's fine.

3751
02:39:09,450 --> 02:39:10,190
We're fine.

3752
02:39:10,750 --> 02:39:12,870
We're gonna go Bora the moment I ult.

3753
02:39:13,890 --> 02:39:14,830
Alright, it's fine.

3754
02:39:15,370 --> 02:39:19,150
We don't talk about Juno, no, no, no, no.

3755
02:39:19,410 --> 02:39:20,990
I don't know like...

3756
02:39:20,990 --> 02:39:23,350
I don't know what goes well with Juno.

3757
02:39:23,410 --> 02:39:26,410
I think if I figure out what the fuck goes well with Juno...

3758
02:39:26,410 --> 02:39:28,830
Like, this would be a lot easier.

3759
02:39:29,470 --> 02:39:31,910
But like, everybody is still meta-crafting.

3760
02:39:32,550 --> 02:39:33,570
Oh, hey, Juno.

3761
02:39:33,750 --> 02:39:35,190
This is what it's like to...

3762
02:39:35,190 --> 02:39:35,270
Oh.

3763
02:39:36,650 --> 02:39:38,450
Well, you had two people shooting you.

3764
02:39:38,510 --> 02:39:38,950
Like, I'm sorry.

3765
02:39:40,050 --> 02:39:40,410
Alright.

3766
02:39:42,710 --> 02:39:43,310
He had...

3767
02:39:43,310 --> 02:39:44,630
Oh, he definitely has pause.

3768
02:39:44,810 --> 02:39:44,930
Yeah!

3769
02:39:45,150 --> 02:39:46,010
I was gonna say.

3770
02:39:46,590 --> 02:39:47,670
That's why I like, got away.

3771
02:39:47,990 --> 02:39:49,290
Because I was like, oh, he has pause.

3772
02:39:54,400 --> 02:39:54,760
Alright.

3773
02:39:55,760 --> 02:39:56,400
Here we go.

3774
02:39:58,740 --> 02:39:59,400
Here we go.

3775
02:40:01,040 --> 02:40:01,760
Untamed power!

3776
02:40:02,460 --> 02:40:03,420
Where's our Juno?

3777
02:40:03,460 --> 02:40:03,800
Where's our Juno?

3778
02:40:03,800 --> 02:40:04,160
Juno!

3779
02:40:04,160 --> 02:40:04,500
Juno!

3780
02:40:06,340 --> 02:40:07,900
Oh, non-existent.

3781
02:40:07,920 --> 02:40:08,520
That's...

3782
02:40:08,520 --> 02:40:09,220
Yeah.

3783
02:40:09,800 --> 02:40:11,100
Yeah, Reaper L2.

3784
02:40:11,560 --> 02:40:12,480
Hey, Juno.

3785
02:40:12,480 --> 02:40:13,140
Can you...

3786
02:40:13,140 --> 02:40:16,120
Juno, can you, you know...

3787
02:40:16,120 --> 02:40:16,880
No!

3788
02:40:17,020 --> 02:40:17,680
That's fine.

3789
02:40:19,420 --> 02:40:20,260
That's fine.

3790
02:40:20,460 --> 02:40:21,900
Hey, that's what it's like to...

3791
02:40:22,520 --> 02:40:23,740
To have a healer.

3792
02:40:23,900 --> 02:40:24,460
Alright.

3793
02:40:24,580 --> 02:40:25,160
Let's...

3794
02:40:25,160 --> 02:40:26,420
Let's play more.

3795
02:40:26,420 --> 02:40:26,560
Oh, boy.

3796
02:40:30,800 --> 02:40:31,360
Alright.

3797
02:40:32,200 --> 02:40:33,000
It's okay.

3798
02:40:34,420 --> 02:40:35,820
It is more a tab.

3799
02:40:39,100 --> 02:40:39,960
It's okay.

3800
02:40:39,960 --> 02:40:42,520
The Juno will learn what healing is like soon.

3801
02:40:42,780 --> 02:40:43,680
I believe.

3802
02:40:46,860 --> 02:40:48,420
They have Reaper L2.

3803
02:40:48,540 --> 02:40:50,640
That's why I'm like...

3804
02:40:50,640 --> 02:40:53,040
I don't know what the fuck is he...

3805
02:40:53,040 --> 02:40:53,400
Oh.

3806
02:40:54,300 --> 02:40:54,860
Oh.

3807
02:40:54,940 --> 02:40:55,340
Alright.

3808
02:40:55,840 --> 02:40:56,400
Alright.

3809
02:40:56,400 --> 02:40:56,640
Alright.

3810
02:40:57,620 --> 02:40:58,100
Alright.

3811
02:40:59,840 --> 02:41:00,540
That's fine.

3812
02:41:03,820 --> 02:41:04,580
That's okay.

3813
02:41:08,080 --> 02:41:09,840
Alright, we're fine, guys.

3814
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:10,920
The Juno's healing again.

3815
02:41:11,060 --> 02:41:12,200
Guys, the Juno's healing!

3816
02:41:12,440 --> 02:41:13,460
We're so fine!

3817
02:41:16,380 --> 02:41:18,080
Like, I'm not as sad anymore.

3818
02:41:22,320 --> 02:41:22,940
It's fine.

3819
02:41:25,300 --> 02:41:26,100
He's healing!

3820
02:41:26,260 --> 02:41:26,380
Yeah.

3821
02:41:26,380 --> 02:41:28,660
That's all I wanted from my Juno.

3822
02:41:30,680 --> 02:41:32,860
Oh shit, I couldn't get to him in time.

3823
02:41:34,080 --> 02:41:37,540
Like, I debated about using my shit, but then I was like...

3824
02:41:38,080 --> 02:41:39,660
I was like, I don't know guys.

3825
02:41:47,470 --> 02:41:48,590
Alright, come on.

3826
02:41:48,770 --> 02:41:50,370
He doesn't... I don't even know if he has shift.

3827
02:41:51,730 --> 02:41:53,410
Oh, I have shift though.

3828
02:41:53,830 --> 02:41:54,490
That's fine!

3829
02:41:55,410 --> 02:41:55,990
It's... oh!

3830
02:41:56,750 --> 02:41:57,190
Alright.

3831
02:41:57,850 --> 02:42:01,530
This is a little concerning that... you know...

3832
02:42:02,350 --> 02:42:04,750
Oh, that is still...

3833
02:42:04,750 --> 02:42:05,130
No!

3834
02:42:08,170 --> 02:42:09,870
Please just heal our Maga!

3835
02:42:10,270 --> 02:42:11,370
Keep him alive!

3836
02:42:12,250 --> 02:42:12,930
Keep... oh!

3837
02:42:13,350 --> 02:42:14,730
There was nothing we could do.

3838
02:42:15,450 --> 02:42:17,750
There is nothing we could do.

3839
02:42:19,150 --> 02:42:20,350
Holy shit.

3840
02:42:20,990 --> 02:42:22,650
We need our own Reaper.

3841
02:42:22,650 --> 02:42:28,250
We must stop the enemy from advancing.

3842
02:42:28,630 --> 02:42:29,810
Okay, wait.

3843
02:42:30,250 --> 02:42:31,470
Nice, I did it.

3844
02:42:32,410 --> 02:42:33,470
What the fuck?

3845
02:42:33,470 --> 02:42:35,250
What is he doing behind us?

3846
02:42:38,830 --> 02:42:41,010
I did something very dumb there.

3847
02:42:42,330 --> 02:42:45,670
And then everybody dropped down as well, like...

3848
02:42:45,670 --> 02:42:49,530
I was just surprised that everyone dropped down with me.

3849
02:42:49,770 --> 02:42:51,110
I was very surprised.

3850
02:42:55,170 --> 02:42:57,930
I did not expect people to drop down.

3851
02:42:59,790 --> 02:43:00,830
Alright, here we go.

3852
02:43:04,080 --> 02:43:05,060
What do we do?

3853
02:43:05,920 --> 02:43:06,640
Nope, goodbye.

3854
02:43:07,100 --> 02:43:08,120
Oh, what?

3855
02:43:08,940 --> 02:43:10,820
How did he not instant die?

3856
02:43:12,900 --> 02:43:14,000
Wait, what?

3857
02:43:16,440 --> 02:43:17,080
Oh.

3858
02:43:19,080 --> 02:43:19,720
That's...

3859
02:43:19,720 --> 02:43:20,540
Oh, he's dead.

3860
02:43:21,660 --> 02:43:22,540
Sorry, bro.

3861
02:43:23,760 --> 02:43:24,400
No!

3862
02:43:24,400 --> 02:43:26,020
Oh, it doesn't matter.

3863
02:43:26,160 --> 02:43:27,160
It doesn't matter.

3864
02:43:27,200 --> 02:43:28,160
Two people died anyway.

3865
02:43:29,960 --> 02:43:31,240
Oh my god.

3866
02:43:33,620 --> 02:43:34,980
How the fuck...

3867
02:43:34,980 --> 02:43:37,940
How the fuck did the Cassidy not instant die?

3868
02:43:38,240 --> 02:43:39,820
I was so surprised there.

3869
02:43:40,220 --> 02:43:40,700
Alright.

3870
02:43:40,920 --> 02:43:42,000
Maybe I should...

3871
02:43:42,860 --> 02:43:43,720
That's the thing.

3872
02:43:43,840 --> 02:43:44,820
I was thinking about Kiriko.

3873
02:43:45,140 --> 02:43:48,700
But I feel like if I go Kiriko, we might not have enough heals.

3874
02:43:51,580 --> 02:43:53,960
Kiriko's healing output is not the best.

3875
02:43:54,400 --> 02:43:56,580
And I could just use for her invuln.

3876
02:44:01,060 --> 02:44:01,740
Okay.

3877
02:44:02,380 --> 02:44:03,900
Where did he come from?

3878
02:44:04,400 --> 02:44:05,100
Where did...

3879
02:44:05,100 --> 02:44:05,600
I...

3880
02:44:05,600 --> 02:44:06,040
Okay.

3881
02:44:08,700 --> 02:44:10,060
Okay, that's...

3882
02:44:10,060 --> 02:44:11,160
Alright.

3883
02:44:15,960 --> 02:44:16,640
Alright.

3884
02:44:17,180 --> 02:44:17,860
Alright.

3885
02:44:19,840 --> 02:44:20,520
He...

3886
02:44:20,520 --> 02:44:21,720
He deserves that.

3887
02:44:22,020 --> 02:44:23,220
He fucking...

3888
02:44:23,220 --> 02:44:24,300
He deserved it.

3889
02:44:24,840 --> 02:44:26,500
He fucking...

3890
02:44:32,720 --> 02:44:34,320
Oh my god.

3891
02:44:34,920 --> 02:44:36,540
He deserves that one.

3892
02:44:36,760 --> 02:44:37,080
He...

3893
02:44:37,760 --> 02:44:38,720
He's a gamer.

3894
02:44:38,920 --> 02:44:40,000
Guys, he...

3895
02:44:40,600 --> 02:44:42,260
Games so fucking hard.

3896
02:44:43,540 --> 02:44:44,340
He...

3897
02:44:44,340 --> 02:44:45,160
Alright.

3898
02:44:45,500 --> 02:44:46,100
Come on.

3899
02:44:46,100 --> 02:44:47,580
I'm poking people.

3900
02:44:49,140 --> 02:44:50,940
I'm poking people.

3901
02:44:50,940 --> 02:44:54,240
I'm poking at so many people.

3902
02:44:55,600 --> 02:44:57,080
I'm poking at so many people.

3903
02:44:57,080 --> 02:45:00,120
You know, sometimes you're just not meant...

3904
02:45:00,120 --> 02:45:02,180
Sometimes, today just wasn't it.

3905
02:45:02,580 --> 02:45:05,280
Today just wasn't the Overwatch day.

3906
02:45:08,630 --> 02:45:12,380
It's cause I forgot to do the... I forgot to do the Juno strat.

3907
02:45:12,720 --> 02:45:14,560
It's the Juno strat.

3908
02:45:14,860 --> 02:45:16,560
It's legitimately...

3909
02:45:16,560 --> 02:45:17,560
It's...

3910
02:45:18,320 --> 02:45:20,080
It's the Juno strat.

3911
02:45:20,420 --> 02:45:23,440
I need to pick Juno first.

3912
02:45:24,140 --> 02:45:24,780
Like...

3913
02:45:25,560 --> 02:45:26,220
That's it.

3914
02:45:27,440 --> 02:45:30,700
The moment I don't pick Juno, I...

3915
02:45:31,940 --> 02:45:33,220
It's actually...

3916
02:45:34,800 --> 02:45:38,060
It's actually... Please Tracer, we need you to get back in.

3917
02:45:40,880 --> 02:45:43,800
I did the Juno strat and then we won.

3918
02:45:44,140 --> 02:45:45,240
Like, legit.

3919
02:45:45,340 --> 02:45:46,320
That's all we need.

3920
02:45:47,780 --> 02:45:49,800
That's all we fucking need.

3921
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:50,880
We just...

3922
02:45:54,590 --> 02:45:56,710
That's like... That's the...

3923
02:45:59,490 --> 02:46:01,490
That's the... The way to win.

3924
02:46:01,730 --> 02:46:04,690
You pick Juno and then you swap off.

3925
02:46:05,730 --> 02:46:07,190
That's basically it.

3926
02:46:12,040 --> 02:46:12,800
Alright.

3927
02:46:16,840 --> 02:46:17,600
Alright.

3928
02:46:26,550 --> 02:46:27,150
Honestly...

3929
02:46:28,530 --> 02:46:30,090
I might be dead here.

3930
02:46:30,650 --> 02:46:33,290
Oh yeah, 100% the Kiriko fell too.

3931
02:46:37,830 --> 02:46:39,770
Maybe I just need ice cream.

3932
02:46:40,710 --> 02:46:41,870
Maybe that's it.

3933
02:46:43,150 --> 02:46:45,170
Maybe I just need fucking ice cream.

3934
02:46:45,270 --> 02:46:45,650
Maybe...

3935
02:46:45,650 --> 02:46:48,050
Maybe that's it.

3936
02:46:48,310 --> 02:46:49,930
Maybe that's it.

3937
02:46:49,930 --> 02:46:51,990
I need ice cream.

3938
02:46:52,130 --> 02:46:53,410
I need...

3939
02:46:56,960 --> 02:46:57,500
Okay.

3940
02:46:57,640 --> 02:46:58,840
Don't cry, please.

3941
02:46:59,460 --> 02:47:01,020
Don't cry!

3942
02:47:05,960 --> 02:47:07,040
Okay.

3943
02:47:09,240 --> 02:47:10,640
Okay, buddy.

3944
02:47:11,800 --> 02:47:12,880
Okay.

3945
02:47:13,980 --> 02:47:15,060
Okay.

3946
02:47:16,160 --> 02:47:17,740
I don't know, man.

3947
02:47:22,040 --> 02:47:22,880
Oh, what?

3948
02:47:23,120 --> 02:47:24,120
What happened to it?

3949
02:47:25,040 --> 02:47:27,020
Wait, what happened to the pulse bomb?

3950
02:47:27,640 --> 02:47:28,800
What the fuck?

3951
02:47:32,620 --> 02:47:34,360
What happened to the pulse bomb?

3952
02:47:36,180 --> 02:47:37,540
Did I cleanse it?

3953
02:47:38,620 --> 02:47:39,920
I didn't cleanse it.

3954
02:47:40,580 --> 02:47:41,320
Did I?

3955
02:47:41,580 --> 02:47:42,540
Bro, I can't tell.

3956
02:47:42,680 --> 02:47:44,660
I'm so fucking out of it right now.

3957
02:47:45,060 --> 02:47:45,340
I...

3958
02:47:48,040 --> 02:47:49,000
There's no...

3959
02:47:51,660 --> 02:47:53,220
What do you wanna do, cleanse it?

3960
02:47:53,460 --> 02:47:54,200
I wasn't...

3961
02:47:54,200 --> 02:47:55,040
You shit her!

3962
02:47:58,770 --> 02:48:00,210
Oh my god.

3963
02:48:02,410 --> 02:48:04,110
Oh my god.

3964
02:48:05,570 --> 02:48:06,770
He fucking...

3965
02:48:06,770 --> 02:48:08,290
I don't know why he was...

3966
02:48:08,290 --> 02:48:09,090
He went in!

3967
02:48:09,890 --> 02:48:12,630
I don't know why he fucking walked in there.

3968
02:48:14,350 --> 02:48:16,170
Why was he aggressing?

3969
02:48:17,670 --> 02:48:18,570
There's no...

3970
02:48:18,570 --> 02:48:19,830
There's no way.

3971
02:48:20,750 --> 02:48:24,650
Maybe like... maybe it's just hopeless.

3972
02:48:25,750 --> 02:48:26,590
Maybe...

3973
02:48:28,430 --> 02:48:31,610
Maybe it's just hopeless.

3974
02:48:37,530 --> 02:48:38,930
Alright.

3975
02:48:51,820 --> 02:48:52,620
Alright.

3976
02:49:01,340 --> 02:49:03,760
This is actually crazy.

3977
02:49:06,260 --> 02:49:07,500
This is actually...

3978
02:49:08,340 --> 02:49:10,160
This is actually crazy.

3979
02:49:11,240 --> 02:49:15,080
I messaged like two people but they are all like busy.

3980
02:49:17,580 --> 02:49:19,180
Oh my god.

3981
02:49:19,420 --> 02:49:21,440
I even messaged like non-stop.

3982
02:49:21,460 --> 02:49:22,640
Streamers and they're like...

3983
02:49:23,200 --> 02:49:26,040
They're like, sorry, we can't play right now.

3984
02:49:29,020 --> 02:49:30,120
Oh my god.

3985
02:49:34,760 --> 02:49:36,960
I'm letting my anger out on DPS.

3986
02:49:38,360 --> 02:49:39,840
More ice cream.

3987
02:49:45,000 --> 02:49:46,580
What the fuck?

3988
02:49:46,800 --> 02:49:47,600
Fuck off!

3989
02:49:48,100 --> 02:49:49,100
Okay, fuck this.

3990
02:49:49,140 --> 02:49:49,540
I'm angry.

3991
02:49:50,680 --> 02:49:51,880
No, fuck this.

3992
02:49:52,100 --> 02:49:52,240
I'm...

3993
02:49:53,400 --> 02:49:54,320
I'm gonna do something else.

3994
02:49:55,080 --> 02:49:55,640
Alright.

3995
02:49:58,020 --> 02:49:58,800
Let's see.

3996
02:50:03,670 --> 02:50:04,650
Alright, here we go.

3997
02:50:08,580 --> 02:50:10,360
Are you serious?!

3998
02:50:10,360 --> 02:50:10,820
Alright.

3999
02:50:11,100 --> 02:50:13,900
No, I was actually gonna play this character.

4000
02:50:14,220 --> 02:50:15,440
For full angry.

4001
02:50:26,230 --> 02:50:26,970
That's right.

4002
02:50:26,970 --> 02:50:27,090
Alright.

4003
02:50:27,130 --> 02:50:28,330
Full angry time.

4004
02:50:32,990 --> 02:50:35,790
Now I'm real angy angy.

4005
02:50:38,950 --> 02:50:42,410
Oh, I did not anticipate the range for that.

4006
02:50:43,640 --> 02:50:45,170
Now I'm full angry.

4007
02:50:45,510 --> 02:50:47,210
Oh, this Hanzo does not know.

4008
02:50:50,730 --> 02:50:53,130
You think I don't see you?

4009
02:51:11,920 --> 02:51:13,320
Oh my goodness.

4010
02:51:13,560 --> 02:51:14,260
Oh my goodness.

4011
02:51:14,260 --> 02:51:15,060
I'm full mad.

4012
02:51:19,250 --> 02:51:20,970
That's so cute, right?

4013
02:51:27,770 --> 02:51:28,470
Alright.

4014
02:51:30,250 --> 02:51:31,670
I feel a bit better.

4015
02:51:32,050 --> 02:51:35,070
I feel a bit better ruining other people's days.

4016
02:51:35,270 --> 02:51:36,130
There it is.

4017
02:51:41,710 --> 02:51:49,710
I feel... I feel so much better ruining other people's days by playing D.Va on deathmatch.

4018
02:51:49,910 --> 02:51:50,690
This is it.

4019
02:51:52,470 --> 02:51:53,370
This is it.

4020
02:51:53,390 --> 02:51:54,210
This is the strat.

4021
02:51:54,930 --> 02:51:56,250
The fucking strat.

4022
02:52:00,710 --> 02:52:02,890
The fucking Juno strat.

4023
02:52:03,310 --> 02:52:04,050
This is it.

4024
02:52:04,490 --> 02:52:07,250
Every time we go Juno and then we swap.

4025
02:52:07,430 --> 02:52:08,230
There's no way this...

4026
02:52:08,230 --> 02:52:14,090
This Mercy insta-picked Mercy so there's no way Juno strats the top 500.

4027
02:52:14,310 --> 02:52:14,710
Good.

4028
02:52:14,790 --> 02:52:15,850
Thank you for the super chat.

4029
02:52:15,950 --> 02:52:16,390
Thank you.

4030
02:52:16,410 --> 02:52:16,810
Thank you.

4031
02:52:16,870 --> 02:52:20,310
I don't think I've ever been this unlucky in Overwatch before.

4032
02:52:20,490 --> 02:52:24,770
The last couple of times through Overwatch, we were doing okay.

4033
02:52:25,970 --> 02:52:27,750
Things were a-okay.

4034
02:52:33,510 --> 02:52:38,210
This has been the most unlucky Overwatch session I've ever had.

4035
02:52:42,070 --> 02:52:45,150
Yeah, it has literally been the rank of all time.

4036
02:52:49,580 --> 02:52:50,140
Woo!

4037
02:52:50,460 --> 02:52:50,940
Woo!

4038
02:52:53,630 --> 02:52:54,570
Oh shit.

4039
02:52:58,680 --> 02:52:59,240
Whoop.

4040
02:53:02,240 --> 02:53:04,160
Oh, definitely not straight out.

4041
02:53:04,920 --> 02:53:06,040
Oh, what?!

4042
02:53:06,040 --> 02:53:07,980
There's a Cassie behind us?!

4043
02:53:07,980 --> 02:53:09,420
Oh, fuck.

4044
02:53:09,600 --> 02:53:10,740
Okay, I did not see that.

4045
02:53:12,220 --> 02:53:12,960
That's fine.

4046
02:53:13,540 --> 02:53:14,540
Now I know.

4047
02:53:15,240 --> 02:53:17,660
I mean, it doesn't matter, but like, now I know.

4048
02:53:18,040 --> 02:53:20,800
Like, it doesn't fucking matter.

4049
02:53:21,680 --> 02:53:22,120
Alright.

4050
02:53:22,440 --> 02:53:23,960
No, it's not time to swap.

4051
02:53:24,780 --> 02:53:26,160
It's not time to swap.

4052
02:53:26,220 --> 02:53:27,280
We can make it work.

4053
02:53:27,820 --> 02:53:30,900
If those other Junos never swap, why should I swap?

4054
02:53:36,860 --> 02:53:38,480
There's no need to swap, guys.

4055
02:53:41,000 --> 02:53:42,260
Okay, maybe I should swap.

4056
02:53:43,020 --> 02:53:43,900
Haha, maybe.

4057
02:53:46,780 --> 02:53:47,180
Maybe.

4058
02:53:49,140 --> 02:53:50,440
No, there's no need to swap.

4059
02:53:50,560 --> 02:53:51,340
I'm not the problem.

4060
02:53:53,840 --> 02:53:54,820
I'm not the problem.

4061
02:53:54,880 --> 02:53:55,700
There's no need to swap.

4062
02:54:05,330 --> 02:54:05,970
That's fine.

4063
02:54:07,310 --> 02:54:07,950
We're fine.

4064
02:54:08,270 --> 02:54:10,610
We're so f- Wait, you can reflect that?!

4065
02:54:10,610 --> 02:54:12,010
Oh, I mean, it makes sense.

4066
02:54:14,050 --> 02:54:15,030
I'm not the problem.

4067
02:54:15,170 --> 02:54:16,010
I don't need to swap.

4068
02:54:19,510 --> 02:54:20,770
Why should I swap?

4069
02:54:25,110 --> 02:54:25,990
Oh, shit!

4070
02:54:26,110 --> 02:54:27,030
He smacked me!

4071
02:54:27,230 --> 02:54:27,670
Okay.

4072
02:54:28,050 --> 02:54:28,710
That's fine.

4073
02:54:31,290 --> 02:54:32,830
I'm still not the problem.

4074
02:54:36,810 --> 02:54:37,630
There's no way.

4075
02:54:37,670 --> 02:54:38,710
I'm not the problem here.

4076
02:54:39,610 --> 02:54:40,350
Alright, nice.

4077
02:54:41,370 --> 02:54:44,350
I'm trying to figure out how to, like, get to places faster.

4078
02:54:45,590 --> 02:54:46,290
Alright, nice.

4079
02:54:49,230 --> 02:54:50,110
Oh, shit.

4080
02:54:50,210 --> 02:54:50,630
What?

4081
02:54:51,910 --> 02:54:52,350
Okay.

4082
02:54:59,000 --> 02:54:59,720
There we go.

4083
02:55:02,680 --> 02:55:03,640
That's f-ing right.

4084
02:55:04,960 --> 02:55:06,040
That's f-ing right!

4085
02:55:06,320 --> 02:55:07,440
I told you!

4086
02:55:08,560 --> 02:55:09,700
I told you!

4087
02:55:10,100 --> 02:55:11,420
I'm not the problem!

4088
02:55:16,380 --> 02:55:19,140
If they don't swap, why should I swap?

4089
02:55:19,660 --> 02:55:26,200
If they get to enjoy a full game of Juno, I should be able to enjoy a full game of Juno.

4090
02:55:32,160 --> 02:55:32,820
If they don't swap, why should I swap?

4091
02:55:34,940 --> 02:55:38,120
I should be allowed to enjoy Juno hours!

4092
02:55:40,940 --> 02:55:42,580
I'm not the problem!

4093
02:55:44,020 --> 02:55:46,080
I'm not the reason here.

4094
02:55:49,180 --> 02:55:50,440
Okay, Mercy, please.

4095
02:55:50,560 --> 02:55:51,800
Okay, never mind.

4096
02:55:52,120 --> 02:55:55,800
I saw them, I saw the Mercy fly away.

4097
02:55:55,800 --> 02:56:02,720
Okay, maybe I'm gonna go.

4098
02:56:03,400 --> 02:56:04,940
Maybe it's non-true.

4099
02:56:04,940 --> 02:56:05,680
No hours now.

4100
02:56:09,200 --> 02:56:10,560
Maybe they're right.

4101
02:56:13,940 --> 02:56:14,680
It's fine.

4102
02:56:14,720 --> 02:56:15,240
I'm here now.

4103
02:56:18,060 --> 02:56:18,660
That's fine.

4104
02:56:20,400 --> 02:56:21,440
Pick up the orb.

4105
02:56:23,420 --> 02:56:25,580
It's like Noverwild never changed.

4106
02:56:26,600 --> 02:56:28,840
Wings, thank you for the super chat.

4107
02:56:28,960 --> 02:56:29,960
Thank you, thank you.

4108
02:56:31,980 --> 02:56:33,340
I'm not the problem.

4109
02:56:37,720 --> 02:56:41,000
I'm swapping not because I think Juno's a bad character.

4110
02:56:43,880 --> 02:56:46,300
That's not why I'm swapping, guys.

4111
02:56:48,540 --> 02:56:52,200
I have other reasons why I would swap, guys.

4112
02:56:52,300 --> 02:56:53,360
It's not because I think Juno's a bad character.

4113
02:56:53,380 --> 02:56:56,580
It's because I think Juno is not a good character.

4114
02:56:56,900 --> 02:56:58,080
That's not it.

4115
02:56:58,920 --> 02:57:00,540
That's not it.

4116
02:57:03,380 --> 02:57:04,780
Alright, we go back.

4117
02:57:05,300 --> 02:57:06,040
Guys!

4118
02:57:06,580 --> 02:57:06,960
Guys!

4119
02:57:07,420 --> 02:57:07,840
Guys!

4120
02:57:09,260 --> 02:57:10,000
Guys!

4121
02:57:11,200 --> 02:57:11,940
Guys!

4122
02:57:13,560 --> 02:57:13,660
Woah!

4123
02:57:14,380 --> 02:57:15,120
Shit!

4124
02:57:16,060 --> 02:57:16,800
Okay.

4125
02:57:17,980 --> 02:57:19,680
Alright, I guess I'll fight here.

4126
02:57:21,720 --> 02:57:22,860
That's a little awkward.

4127
02:57:22,920 --> 02:57:23,560
Not gonna lie.

4128
02:57:25,720 --> 02:57:26,380
It's okay.

4129
02:57:26,460 --> 02:57:27,800
We got almost 90.

4130
02:57:28,120 --> 02:57:28,640
That's...

4131
02:57:32,800 --> 02:57:33,500
That's fine.

4132
02:57:33,720 --> 02:57:35,300
I have ult for this.

4133
02:57:37,100 --> 02:57:37,660
Alright.

4134
02:57:39,400 --> 02:57:39,960
Oh!

4135
02:57:40,200 --> 02:57:42,180
Oh, there's a little mini speed boost.

4136
02:57:43,920 --> 02:57:44,480
Oh!

4137
02:57:44,480 --> 02:57:45,040
Oh, there's a little mini speed boost.

4138
02:57:45,040 --> 02:57:48,700
I swapped off Juno not because she was a problem.

4139
02:57:48,700 --> 02:57:51,580
Guys, I need you guys to know that.

4140
02:57:51,800 --> 02:57:52,740
It was...

4141
02:57:52,740 --> 02:57:54,820
It's just I needed to get there faster.

4142
02:57:55,420 --> 02:57:57,140
So, like, I had to swap.

4143
02:57:57,280 --> 02:57:57,740
You know?

4144
02:57:59,600 --> 02:58:02,260
Like, I had to swap because I had to...

4145
02:58:02,260 --> 02:58:04,740
I had to get to the destination.

4146
02:58:07,420 --> 02:58:08,220
That's fucking right.

4147
02:58:09,180 --> 02:58:10,140
That's fucking right.

4148
02:58:10,620 --> 02:58:11,920
Juno could have done this.

4149
02:58:11,960 --> 02:58:13,720
Done exactly this.

4150
02:58:14,260 --> 02:58:15,020
Okay, guys.

4151
02:58:15,720 --> 02:58:16,200
Juno...

4152
02:58:20,420 --> 02:58:21,800
Juno could have also...

4153
02:58:21,800 --> 02:58:21,900
Juno could have also...

4154
02:58:21,900 --> 02:58:23,840
I could have easily done this on Juno too, guys.

4155
02:58:24,080 --> 02:58:24,920
I just want you to know.

4156
02:58:26,880 --> 02:58:27,380
Alright.

4157
02:58:29,920 --> 02:58:30,580
We're fine.

4158
02:58:31,940 --> 02:58:32,760
Okay, attack.

4159
02:58:36,260 --> 02:58:39,700
All I'm saying is that we're doing it.

4160
02:58:39,940 --> 02:58:41,400
We're fucking doing it.

4161
02:58:48,240 --> 02:58:52,200
Winning because of Juno dip because they have Juno.

4162
02:58:57,100 --> 02:58:57,780
Damn.

4163
02:58:58,120 --> 02:58:59,100
That must suck.

4164
02:59:01,380 --> 02:59:03,460
Imagine having Juno.

4165
02:59:03,640 --> 02:59:04,840
Couldn't be me.

4166
02:59:05,240 --> 02:59:05,760
Wait, what?

4167
02:59:09,460 --> 02:59:10,600
What the fuck?

4168
02:59:13,480 --> 02:59:14,300
Oh my god.

4169
02:59:14,460 --> 02:59:16,560
Is our Winston okay over there?

4170
02:59:16,560 --> 02:59:19,120
I don't think our Winston's gonna live.

4171
02:59:19,720 --> 02:59:20,520
Oh, wait.

4172
02:59:20,580 --> 02:59:20,920
He did.

4173
02:59:21,420 --> 02:59:21,940
Alright.

4174
02:59:24,000 --> 02:59:24,520
Oh!

4175
02:59:25,780 --> 02:59:26,300
Shit!

4176
02:59:27,260 --> 02:59:28,400
That was scary.

4177
02:59:28,820 --> 02:59:29,340
Bro.

4178
02:59:31,620 --> 02:59:32,920
That was a little scary.

4179
02:59:33,440 --> 02:59:34,820
I might be dead though.

4180
02:59:36,920 --> 02:59:37,560
That's fine.

4181
02:59:37,640 --> 02:59:38,460
I'm still on point.

4182
02:59:40,460 --> 02:59:41,180
It's fine.

4183
02:59:41,260 --> 02:59:41,980
I'm still here.

4184
02:59:43,180 --> 02:59:44,440
I'm still here.

4185
02:59:47,840 --> 02:59:48,400
Alright.

4186
02:59:49,260 --> 02:59:49,820
See?

4187
02:59:50,020 --> 02:59:51,380
We're doing okay.

4188
02:59:56,820 --> 02:59:59,180
I'm pretty sure that Winston has...

4189
02:59:59,180 --> 02:59:59,900
Oh no.

4190
03:00:00,200 --> 03:00:01,100
Oh no.

4191
03:00:01,660 --> 03:00:02,300
It's okay.

4192
03:00:02,360 --> 03:00:03,180
We didn't need him.

4193
03:00:04,160 --> 03:00:04,900
It's okay.

4194
03:00:04,960 --> 03:00:05,840
We didn't need him.

4195
03:00:05,880 --> 03:00:06,080
Please.

4196
03:00:06,200 --> 03:00:06,720
Please.

4197
03:00:06,760 --> 03:00:07,560
I beg of you.

4198
03:00:07,640 --> 03:00:08,180
Please don't.

4199
03:00:08,180 --> 03:00:08,720
I see you.

4200
03:00:08,940 --> 03:00:09,500
PISTOLING!

4201
03:00:09,500 --> 03:00:09,920
MERCY!

4202
03:00:11,080 --> 03:00:12,200
Holy shit!

4203
03:00:13,320 --> 03:00:16,380
I literally saw the Mercy pistoling.

4204
03:00:16,900 --> 03:00:18,380
Holy fuck.

4205
03:00:21,840 --> 03:00:23,340
I was not happy.

4206
03:00:23,560 --> 03:00:26,020
I was not happy.

4207
03:00:26,420 --> 03:00:26,860
I was not happy.

4208
03:00:27,400 --> 03:00:28,980
I was not happy.

4209
03:00:28,980 --> 03:00:29,540
Don't make me!

4210
03:00:29,640 --> 03:00:30,620
I will use this!

4211
03:00:31,200 --> 03:00:32,040
I will...

4212
03:00:36,320 --> 03:00:37,260
Oh god.

4213
03:00:37,500 --> 03:00:38,200
Please, Mercy.

4214
03:00:39,720 --> 03:00:40,320
Alright.

4215
03:00:40,540 --> 03:00:41,760
I did what I could.

4216
03:00:42,660 --> 03:00:45,260
Guys, I think the Juno strat actually worked.

4217
03:00:45,600 --> 03:00:47,420
That's like the most...

4218
03:00:48,760 --> 03:00:50,000
Guys, I think...

4219
03:00:51,000 --> 03:00:52,940
I think it's the Juno strat.

4220
03:00:53,400 --> 03:00:54,800
I think it's the...

4221
03:00:54,800 --> 03:00:56,360
Guys, I figured it out.

4222
03:01:00,920 --> 03:01:01,540
Guys...

4223
03:01:04,900 --> 03:01:05,520
Guys...

4224
03:01:05,520 --> 03:01:05,700
Guys...

4225
03:01:05,700 --> 03:01:06,680
Guys...

4226
03:01:11,740 --> 03:01:12,360
Guys...

4227
03:01:12,360 --> 03:01:13,140
Guys...

4228
03:01:14,400 --> 03:01:15,020
Guys...

4229
03:01:15,660 --> 03:01:16,280
Guys...

4230
03:01:16,280 --> 03:01:18,520
We figured out this strat.

4231
03:01:19,020 --> 03:01:27,700
We actually figured out this strat.

4232
03:01:28,240 --> 03:01:31,640
I just need to pick Juno.

4233
03:01:33,100 --> 03:01:35,180
Oh my god.

4234
03:01:35,380 --> 03:01:36,760
Guys, this is the Juno strat.

4235
03:01:36,780 --> 03:01:39,180
Hoping the opponent has Juno.

4236
03:01:39,400 --> 03:01:43,060
It's all I have to do is I pick Juno.

4237
03:01:43,060 --> 03:01:47,660
So my team, my other support can't play Juno.

4238
03:01:48,000 --> 03:01:51,280
And then when I do that, I swap off Juno.

4239
03:01:54,300 --> 03:01:56,540
Like, that's all I have to do.

4240
03:01:57,080 --> 03:02:05,760
Literally, the two games I won was because I made sure my other support could not play Juno.

4241
03:02:07,580 --> 03:02:09,120
It just works.

4242
03:02:10,580 --> 03:02:14,160
That is literally our saving grace right now.

4243
03:02:15,280 --> 03:02:17,680
We just always happen to have...

4244
03:02:18,520 --> 03:02:20,920
I mean, I'm fucking terrible at Juno.

4245
03:02:24,240 --> 03:02:28,160
Even I admit I don't know what I'm fucking doing when it comes to Juno.

4246
03:02:29,500 --> 03:02:31,980
Jesus Christ, that's fucked up.

4247
03:02:33,620 --> 03:02:35,300
No, that's the streamer mode name.

4248
03:02:35,420 --> 03:02:37,000
The Juno reverse card.

4249
03:02:37,520 --> 03:02:39,120
Rusty, thank you for the super chat.

4250
03:02:39,260 --> 03:02:39,620
Thank you.

4251
03:02:42,340 --> 03:02:48,860
As long as my team doesn't play Juno, like, we can act it.

4252
03:02:49,020 --> 03:02:49,580
There's hope.

4253
03:02:49,820 --> 03:02:51,500
There's actual hope.

4254
03:02:53,960 --> 03:02:54,900
Oh, fuck.

4255
03:02:58,500 --> 03:02:59,300
That's good.

4256
03:03:00,420 --> 03:03:02,920
I don't trust anybody on Juno.

4257
03:03:03,540 --> 03:03:06,900
Like, legitimately, I don't trust anybody on Juno right now.

4258
03:03:07,840 --> 03:03:09,700
I feel like every time

4259
03:03:14,480 --> 03:03:15,500
I see him, I'm like, what the fuck are you gonna do?

4260
03:03:15,560 --> 03:03:16,180
Freeze me?

4261
03:03:17,220 --> 03:03:18,180
Oh, shit.

4262
03:03:18,260 --> 03:03:19,140
Wait, that works?

4263
03:03:23,760 --> 03:03:25,120
Oh my god, he did.

4264
03:03:25,440 --> 03:03:27,640
What the fuck, he did freeze me.

4265
03:03:27,760 --> 03:03:28,740
I was joking.

4266
03:03:31,100 --> 03:03:33,040
I didn't realize that hurt.

4267
03:03:33,080 --> 03:03:34,760
That hits me all the way up there.

4268
03:03:35,000 --> 03:03:36,600
That was just fucking around.

4269
03:03:46,700 --> 03:03:48,140
You fucker!

4270
03:03:52,980 --> 03:03:54,400
I will kill...

4271
03:03:54,400 --> 03:03:56,080
I'll kill this meme.

4272
03:03:56,320 --> 03:03:58,080
I'll kill this meme.

4273
03:03:58,120 --> 03:04:00,040
It's the last thing I do.

4274
03:04:01,440 --> 03:04:03,200
No, you're not the meme.

4275
03:04:03,420 --> 03:04:04,760
Where are you?

4276
03:04:05,040 --> 03:04:05,760
No!

4277
03:04:12,840 --> 03:04:14,880
Alright, guys, I'm fine.

4278
03:04:15,000 --> 03:04:15,760
Where's Juno?

4279
03:04:15,760 --> 03:04:18,220
Where the fuck is this Juno?

4280
03:04:19,560 --> 03:04:20,280
Okay.

4281
03:04:21,980 --> 03:04:23,640
We figured it out.

4282
03:04:24,080 --> 03:04:26,880
We figured it out.

4283
03:04:32,040 --> 03:04:34,160
We figured it out.

4284
03:04:38,320 --> 03:04:39,520
We know...

4285
03:04:40,120 --> 03:04:41,600
We know the meta.

4286
03:04:44,980 --> 03:04:49,020
I guess, like, we need to figure out how to fucking walk around.

4287
03:04:49,920 --> 03:04:50,560
Yippee!

4288
03:04:54,000 --> 03:04:55,820
Okay, can I, like, go up?

4289
03:04:56,140 --> 03:04:57,040
No, okay.

4290
03:04:57,460 --> 03:05:00,340
I don't really like the controls of the glide.

4291
03:05:01,180 --> 03:05:03,240
The anti-Juno strat, yeah.

4292
03:05:06,440 --> 03:05:07,080
Alright.

4293
03:05:07,560 --> 03:05:08,460
She's cute!

4294
03:05:09,140 --> 03:05:10,760
Fucking hell, I hate her.

4295
03:05:11,000 --> 03:05:13,100
I hate her so much.

4296
03:05:16,420 --> 03:05:17,060
Alright.

4297
03:05:18,480 --> 03:05:19,820
This is my meta.

4298
03:05:20,000 --> 03:05:26,260
I insta-locked Juno so nobody can play Juno and then we, like, we have a game.

4299
03:05:39,010 --> 03:05:40,770
Okay, I can't save that.

4300
03:05:41,450 --> 03:05:42,490
Like, I...

4301
03:05:42,490 --> 03:05:44,650
I don't know what to do with that.

4302
03:05:47,530 --> 03:05:47,850
Okay.

4303
03:05:51,810 --> 03:05:52,450
Okay!

4304
03:05:53,950 --> 03:05:54,590
We...

4305
03:05:55,390 --> 03:05:56,910
did all we could.

4306
03:05:57,810 --> 03:05:58,670
We actually did all.

4307
03:06:00,770 --> 03:06:04,390
I think it's time where I pick a different character the moment I die.

4308
03:06:14,610 --> 03:06:15,110
Alright.

4309
03:06:16,190 --> 03:06:17,250
Oh my god.

4310
03:06:17,290 --> 03:06:18,570
Please, get one.

4311
03:06:18,830 --> 03:06:19,410
That's all I...

4312
03:06:19,410 --> 03:06:20,230
I just want one kill.

4313
03:06:20,390 --> 03:06:21,930
I just...

4314
03:06:21,930 --> 03:06:23,590
I just...

4315
03:06:26,150 --> 03:06:26,650
Please.

4316
03:06:27,370 --> 03:06:28,710
Please, he's so low.

4317
03:06:31,370 --> 03:06:31,870
Please.

4318
03:06:31,870 --> 03:06:32,070
Please.

4319
03:06:37,460 --> 03:06:39,720
Oh my god, I'm just healing the tank!

4320
03:06:41,580 --> 03:06:42,100
Nice.

4321
03:06:45,300 --> 03:06:46,260
Jesus Christ.

4322
03:06:47,080 --> 03:06:48,280
I almost have...

4323
03:06:48,280 --> 03:06:48,880
Nice!

4324
03:06:57,000 --> 03:06:58,060
That's fucking right!

4325
03:07:01,420 --> 03:07:02,700
Okay, he should be dead.

4326
03:07:03,160 --> 03:07:03,900
Thank god.

4327
03:07:04,280 --> 03:07:05,760
Oh, thank god!

4328
03:07:08,860 --> 03:07:10,380
I will fucking fly!

4329
03:07:10,800 --> 03:07:13,040
I will fucking fly!

4330
03:07:13,040 --> 03:07:13,060
I will fucking fly!

4331
03:07:13,300 --> 03:07:13,940
Oh!

4332
03:07:14,880 --> 03:07:15,920
This is it!

4333
03:07:16,100 --> 03:07:17,260
I knew it!

4334
03:07:21,300 --> 03:07:23,000
I fucking knew it!

4335
03:07:23,580 --> 03:07:24,020
I fucking knew it!

4336
03:07:27,070 --> 03:07:29,670
Can we, like, make sure he's not there?

4337
03:07:36,770 --> 03:07:37,410
Alright.

4338
03:07:38,870 --> 03:07:40,390
Go, tank, go!

4339
03:07:40,870 --> 03:07:40,950
Go, tank, go!

4340
03:07:43,450 --> 03:07:44,090
Alright.

4341
03:07:44,090 --> 03:07:45,090
Alright, that did nothing.

4342
03:07:46,550 --> 03:07:47,570
Feels like...

4343
03:07:48,090 --> 03:07:50,250
Feels like I contributed...

4344
03:07:50,250 --> 03:07:50,890
What the fuck?

4345
03:07:51,670 --> 03:07:53,050
Okay, that was clutch.

4346
03:07:56,030 --> 03:07:57,130
Alright, here we go.

4347
03:07:59,810 --> 03:08:01,590
Why didn't I discover this meta sooner?

4348
03:08:01,930 --> 03:08:02,650
Why didn't...

4349
03:08:07,390 --> 03:08:08,890
Oh my god.

4350
03:08:12,660 --> 03:08:14,680
Why didn't I discover this meta?

4351
03:08:15,340 --> 03:08:16,760
I can't believe it.

4352
03:08:21,060 --> 03:08:21,700
Okay...

4353
03:08:24,240 --> 03:08:24,880
Okay...

4354
03:08:24,880 --> 03:08:25,940
Okay...

4355
03:08:25,940 --> 03:08:26,540
Okay...

4356
03:08:31,220 --> 03:08:32,700
Alright, that's our grid.

4357
03:08:32,860 --> 03:08:36,080
I mean, I could swap, but like...

4358
03:08:36,080 --> 03:08:37,920
I'm not the problem.

4359
03:08:39,080 --> 03:08:39,720
Like...

4360
03:08:40,300 --> 03:08:42,160
We could swap, but like...

4361
03:08:42,160 --> 03:08:44,520
I don't think I'm the problem.

4362
03:08:45,000 --> 03:08:46,120
I don't think I'm the problem.

4363
03:08:46,120 --> 03:08:46,360
I don't think I'm the problem.

4364
03:08:52,220 --> 03:08:52,740
Alright.

4365
03:08:59,680 --> 03:09:00,480
Oh, shit.

4366
03:09:02,380 --> 03:09:03,800
Oh, he's so low!

4367
03:09:07,380 --> 03:09:08,140
Oh, god.

4368
03:09:08,760 --> 03:09:09,860
I'm trying my best.

4369
03:09:11,020 --> 03:09:11,820
Oh, okay.

4370
03:09:13,500 --> 03:09:15,100
Okay, I'm fucking flying.

4371
03:09:15,460 --> 03:09:18,560
They have mail.

4372
03:09:23,010 --> 03:09:24,030
What the fuck?

4373
03:09:24,210 --> 03:09:24,630
Oh, shit.

4374
03:09:24,750 --> 03:09:25,550
Okay, thank god.

4375
03:09:28,450 --> 03:09:28,990
It's fine.

4376
03:09:29,070 --> 03:09:29,390
We're fine.

4377
03:09:30,290 --> 03:09:31,410
It's not mail, though.

4378
03:09:34,050 --> 03:09:35,550
I'm a little worried with the mail.

4379
03:09:39,910 --> 03:09:40,870
Get out of here.

4380
03:09:41,050 --> 03:09:41,930
Get out of here!

4381
03:09:44,630 --> 03:09:46,290
Yeah, this guy knows what he's doing.

4382
03:09:46,430 --> 03:09:47,030
Which is nice.

4383
03:09:50,820 --> 03:09:51,220
Alright.

4384
03:09:51,220 --> 03:09:53,000
I told you I'm not the problem.

4385
03:09:56,220 --> 03:09:57,920
I told you guys.

4386
03:09:59,000 --> 03:10:00,540
I know what I'm doing.

4387
03:10:06,380 --> 03:10:06,900
Okay.

4388
03:10:09,060 --> 03:10:10,700
Okay, they have...

4389
03:10:13,500 --> 03:10:14,540
Oh, no.

4390
03:10:14,660 --> 03:10:15,240
Does that hit me?

4391
03:10:18,980 --> 03:10:20,080
Where is our orbit?

4392
03:10:20,280 --> 03:10:21,560
I was gonna say...

4393
03:10:21,560 --> 03:10:22,740
Where is it?

4394
03:10:27,050 --> 03:10:27,450
Where is it?

4395
03:10:27,450 --> 03:10:28,350
I hate her ult.

4396
03:10:30,770 --> 03:10:31,330
Oh, wait.

4397
03:10:31,350 --> 03:10:31,850
She lives?

4398
03:10:32,390 --> 03:10:32,790
How?

4399
03:10:39,150 --> 03:10:40,310
Go get him, Bob!

4400
03:10:44,080 --> 03:10:44,660
Get in there.

4401
03:10:44,700 --> 03:10:44,900
Speed!

4402
03:10:46,160 --> 03:10:46,820
Oh, god.

4403
03:10:46,900 --> 03:10:47,400
I threw.

4404
03:10:47,560 --> 03:10:48,100
I threw.

4405
03:10:48,260 --> 03:10:48,740
I threw.

4406
03:10:48,820 --> 03:10:49,340
I'm so sorry.

4407
03:10:49,380 --> 03:10:50,460
I did not mean to do that.

4408
03:10:53,800 --> 03:10:54,980
I told you guys.

4409
03:10:55,620 --> 03:10:57,520
I'm so good at Juno.

4410
03:10:58,760 --> 03:11:00,180
It's like a damage boost.

4411
03:11:00,200 --> 03:11:02,000
But like...

4412
03:11:02,000 --> 03:11:03,340
Feels useless.

4413
03:11:05,200 --> 03:11:06,000
Okay.

4414
03:11:10,140 --> 03:11:11,120
We're fine.

4415
03:11:15,280 --> 03:11:16,420
Yes, I do.

4416
03:11:24,770 --> 03:11:25,570
Goodbye.

4417
03:11:26,390 --> 03:11:27,190
Goodbye.

4418
03:11:29,570 --> 03:11:32,310
That was such a good pull.

4419
03:11:32,430 --> 03:11:33,030
Holy shit.

4420
03:11:37,160 --> 03:11:38,240
Oh, guys.

4421
03:11:38,420 --> 03:11:39,280
I'm a little...

4422
03:11:42,960 --> 03:11:43,600
Nice.

4423
03:11:50,850 --> 03:11:51,490
Nice.

4424
03:11:51,810 --> 03:11:51,930
Nice.

4425
03:11:51,930 --> 03:11:53,810
It's just the ride.

4426
03:11:56,430 --> 03:11:57,070
Hey.

4427
03:11:57,250 --> 03:11:57,890
Hey.

4428
03:12:00,390 --> 03:12:01,030
Nice.

4429
03:12:01,470 --> 03:12:02,110
Easy.

4430
03:12:03,570 --> 03:12:04,890
Hey, what about me?

4431
03:12:05,030 --> 03:12:06,150
I did stuff.

4432
03:12:07,370 --> 03:12:08,010
I...

4433
03:12:12,090 --> 03:12:13,810
What is everyone talking about the...

4434
03:12:13,810 --> 03:12:14,610
What about me?

4435
03:12:17,830 --> 03:12:19,650
I kept people alive.

4436
03:12:21,750 --> 03:12:23,050
I kept people alive.

4437
03:12:23,150 --> 03:12:24,430
I literally picked...

4438
03:12:24,430 --> 03:12:27,810
If I didn't pick Juno, he would not pick Life Weaver.

4439
03:12:28,070 --> 03:12:28,790
Guys.

4440
03:12:29,110 --> 03:12:30,430
If I didn't...

4441
03:12:30,430 --> 03:12:33,910
Guys, you gotta congratulate me for picking Juno.

4442
03:12:33,910 --> 03:12:38,550
Because me picking Juno allows him to play Life Weaver.

4443
03:12:43,190 --> 03:12:48,370
If I wasn't here, we wouldn't have gotten this Life Weaver.

4444
03:12:49,750 --> 03:12:51,310
You're doing great.

4445
03:12:52,450 --> 03:12:53,010
Sweet.

4446
03:12:55,370 --> 03:12:57,250
Thank you for the super chat.

4447
03:12:57,330 --> 03:12:57,750
Thank you.

4448
03:13:00,710 --> 03:13:05,030
I literally made it so that he had to play Life Weaver, guys.

4449
03:13:05,270 --> 03:13:06,230
You're welcome.

4450
03:13:07,510 --> 03:13:08,910
Awesome job, team.

4451
03:13:08,990 --> 03:13:10,590
And Juno too, I guess.

4452
03:13:10,830 --> 03:13:12,630
Rusty, thank you for the super chat.

4453
03:13:12,710 --> 03:13:12,990
Thank you.

4454
03:13:12,990 --> 03:13:13,550
Thank you.

4455
03:13:13,630 --> 03:13:16,130
Nobody can appreciate my genius.

4456
03:13:16,930 --> 03:13:18,590
My meta-crafting.

4457
03:13:20,690 --> 03:13:21,030
Nobody...

4458
03:13:21,030 --> 03:13:27,390
Nobody knows the things I go through until I put on the mask.

4459
03:13:28,650 --> 03:13:29,710
You want my clothes?

4460
03:13:29,790 --> 03:13:30,150
Sorry, guys.

4461
03:13:30,910 --> 03:13:32,370
What in the hell they talk?

4462
03:13:33,490 --> 03:13:34,170
Alright.

4463
03:13:39,060 --> 03:13:40,240
You're fucking welcome.

4464
03:13:46,620 --> 03:13:48,140
Oh, he ate it!

4465
03:13:48,380 --> 03:13:48,540
Oh, he ate it!

4466
03:13:53,670 --> 03:13:54,510
Jesus Christ.

4467
03:13:54,670 --> 03:13:55,950
Oh my god, okay.

4468
03:14:00,380 --> 03:14:01,240
What the fuck?

4469
03:14:07,810 --> 03:14:08,990
Wait, what the fuck?

4470
03:14:09,110 --> 03:14:10,010
Oh my god, that was weird.

4471
03:14:15,080 --> 03:14:15,520
Please!

4472
03:14:16,600 --> 03:14:17,680
Somebody kill him!

4473
03:14:21,870 --> 03:14:22,310
Nice.

4474
03:14:23,470 --> 03:14:24,230
We did it.

4475
03:14:24,250 --> 03:14:24,810
We killed him.

4476
03:14:28,640 --> 03:14:29,460
He's like one!

4477
03:14:30,420 --> 03:14:30,860
See?

4478
03:14:30,960 --> 03:14:31,600
Look at that!

4479
03:14:34,480 --> 03:14:34,920
Sorry.

4480
03:14:35,260 --> 03:14:36,340
My aimbot was acting up there.

4481
03:14:37,680 --> 03:14:42,440
I like how I can say that and know you guys don't believe me because I lost four games in a row.

4482
03:14:49,840 --> 03:14:50,780
They're like, sure.

4483
03:14:51,500 --> 03:14:51,980
Aimbot.

4484
03:14:56,780 --> 03:14:57,740
I hit

4485
03:15:05,160 --> 03:15:06,240
him?

4486
03:15:06,340 --> 03:15:06,980
Oh, I did.

4487
03:15:09,020 --> 03:15:09,580
There we go.

4488
03:15:10,180 --> 03:15:11,140
Does that do anything?

4489
03:15:12,680 --> 03:15:13,940
Why doesn't it do anything?

4490
03:15:17,000 --> 03:15:19,820
I swear the AWP does nothing!

4491
03:15:28,340 --> 03:15:29,540
I swear the AWP does nothing!

4492
03:15:29,700 --> 03:15:30,860
We got the victory.

4493
03:15:32,440 --> 03:15:33,040
Okay.

4494
03:15:33,140 --> 03:15:34,020
I guess.

4495
03:15:34,800 --> 03:15:36,020
Our poor Widow.

4496
03:15:40,480 --> 03:15:41,960
Oh, the Widow's still alive.

4497
03:15:42,280 --> 03:15:42,880
Good for him.

4498
03:15:43,400 --> 03:15:44,460
You got it?

4499
03:15:44,460 --> 03:15:45,120
You got it?

4500
03:15:45,120 --> 03:15:47,020
You got it?

4501
03:15:48,700 --> 03:15:49,340
No!

4502
03:15:56,150 --> 03:15:57,350
The awp!

4503
03:16:01,810 --> 03:16:02,910
He's so low!

4504
03:16:02,990 --> 03:16:03,810
What the fuck?

4505
03:16:03,850 --> 03:16:04,290
They're running!

4506
03:16:11,560 --> 03:16:13,500
They're literally running the same comp!

4507
03:16:18,920 --> 03:16:20,580
Somebody please kill him.

4508
03:16:20,880 --> 03:16:22,320
Shoot him in the back.

4509
03:16:22,320 --> 03:16:23,000
Please.

4510
03:16:23,460 --> 03:16:25,280
Holy fuck.

4511
03:16:29,350 --> 03:16:30,270
I fly.

4512
03:16:31,450 --> 03:16:32,470
I stopped flying.

4513
03:16:32,690 --> 03:16:34,070
Flying was a mistake.

4514
03:16:38,590 --> 03:16:39,630
Oh no.

4515
03:16:39,730 --> 03:16:42,690
I feel like every time I ult, it does nothing.

4516
03:16:46,770 --> 03:16:50,410
I'm not happy about her ult at all.

4517
03:16:50,730 --> 03:16:53,670
I'm not happy about her ult at all.

4518
03:16:53,670 --> 03:16:54,910
That's funny.

4519
03:16:55,250 --> 03:16:57,670
That was a good pull.

4520
03:17:02,260 --> 03:17:05,100
That was actually a really good pull there.

4521
03:17:05,200 --> 03:17:06,700
That's a really funny pull.

4522
03:17:15,710 --> 03:17:17,710
I think I won't do it too!

4523
03:17:18,050 --> 03:17:19,210
That's fucking right!

4524
03:17:19,330 --> 03:17:20,510
Vector vs Vector!

4525
03:17:21,090 --> 03:17:23,210
We're despicable being this shit!

4526
03:17:23,610 --> 03:17:24,150
We're despicable being this shit!

4527
03:17:27,010 --> 03:17:28,310
We're despicable being this shit!

4528
03:17:28,310 --> 03:17:28,570
Fuck.

4529
03:17:30,750 --> 03:17:31,750
Look at that.

4530
03:17:31,790 --> 03:17:32,850
Both Juno did nothing.

4531
03:17:35,250 --> 03:17:35,850
Actually...

4532
03:17:38,810 --> 03:17:39,630
That's fine.

4533
03:17:40,730 --> 03:17:41,930
Both Juno...

4534
03:17:42,670 --> 03:17:43,870
contributed nothing.

4535
03:17:47,960 --> 03:17:49,740
Guys, I think it's time...

4536
03:17:49,740 --> 03:17:51,380
I swapped off Juno.

4537
03:17:51,380 --> 03:17:53,380
I didn't think it...

4538
03:18:01,630 --> 03:18:02,750
Wait, unless...

4539
03:18:04,210 --> 03:18:05,390
I'm fucking gonna...

4540
03:18:07,170 --> 03:18:08,070
Oh shit!

4541
03:18:08,490 --> 03:18:09,510
I fucked up.

4542
03:18:12,090 --> 03:18:14,550
I fucked up and I used the wrong ability.

4543
03:18:16,930 --> 03:18:18,190
That's fucking right.

4544
03:18:18,690 --> 03:18:19,870
That's fucking right!

4545
03:18:19,930 --> 03:18:20,830
Get staggered!

4546
03:18:20,890 --> 03:18:21,550
Get staggered!

4547
03:18:24,570 --> 03:18:25,050
Goodbye!

4548
03:18:25,270 --> 03:18:26,110
I won't make sense!

4549
03:18:27,230 --> 03:18:27,890
He's fine.

4550
03:18:30,490 --> 03:18:31,390
He's so fine.

4551
03:18:34,900 --> 03:18:35,380
Alright.

4552
03:18:47,580 --> 03:18:49,200
I almost killed him too!

4553
03:18:49,880 --> 03:18:50,660
I almost killed him too!

4554
03:18:50,660 --> 03:18:51,660
Oh, that was a good roll.

4555
03:18:55,740 --> 03:18:56,640
Oh god, no.

4556
03:18:57,080 --> 03:18:57,740
Oh no.

4557
03:18:58,320 --> 03:19:01,020
Guys, why didn't I swap off Juno when I had the chance?

4558
03:19:01,320 --> 03:19:01,640
Guys, why didn't I swap off Juno when I had the chance?

4559
03:19:01,640 --> 03:19:01,880
Why did...

4560
03:19:02,840 --> 03:19:06,760
Why did I swap off Juno when I had the chance?

4561
03:19:08,740 --> 03:19:09,380
He's a cunning failsafe.

4562
03:19:09,380 --> 03:19:11,080
I forgot the second part of the strat.

4563
03:19:17,240 --> 03:19:23,320
Guys, there's a second part of the strat and it requires me to swap off Juno.

4564
03:19:24,880 --> 03:19:25,860
Oh, no.

4565
03:19:26,660 --> 03:19:27,840
Guys, it's fine.

4566
03:19:28,140 --> 03:19:29,840
If I die here, please...

4567
03:19:29,840 --> 03:19:30,160
Why...?

4568
03:19:30,160 --> 03:19:30,540
No!

4569
03:19:31,060 --> 03:19:34,600
I want to swap off Juno.

4570
03:19:34,940 --> 03:19:37,680
No, I don't have time to swap off Juno!

4571
03:19:39,480 --> 03:19:40,360
No!

4572
03:19:40,560 --> 03:19:43,200
I'm part of the problem now!

4573
03:19:43,640 --> 03:19:47,980
I didn't do the second part of the strat!

4574
03:19:48,740 --> 03:19:51,260
I got too cocky!

4575
03:19:51,460 --> 03:19:53,580
They have Mei on!

4576
03:20:07,700 --> 03:20:08,120
Oh god.

4577
03:20:17,040 --> 03:20:17,560
No!

4578
03:20:17,840 --> 03:20:19,020
No, no, no, no, no, no!

4579
03:20:23,480 --> 03:20:24,180
Oh god!

4580
03:20:29,240 --> 03:20:30,020
Oh god!

4581
03:20:32,100 --> 03:20:33,880
Oh my god!

4582
03:20:34,900 --> 03:20:36,440
Okay, they can still touch.

4583
03:20:41,390 --> 03:20:42,350
Please just zap!

4584
03:20:42,410 --> 03:20:43,030
Just zap her!

4585
03:20:43,650 --> 03:20:44,170
Yes!

4586
03:20:44,730 --> 03:20:46,310
I'm not the problem!

4587
03:20:47,110 --> 03:20:49,230
I'm not the problem!

4588
03:20:51,310 --> 03:20:52,850
We figured it out!

4589
03:20:52,890 --> 03:20:54,390
I'm not the problem!

4590
03:20:59,890 --> 03:21:01,170
I told you guys!

4591
03:21:02,250 --> 03:21:08,450
If they can have fun with Juno, I can have fun with Juno!

4592
03:21:08,490 --> 03:21:11,170
I knew I wasn't the problem!

4593
03:21:18,030 --> 03:21:20,510
GG Life Weaver.

4594
03:21:20,710 --> 03:21:23,190
I'm looking up 6k damage!

4595
03:21:27,770 --> 03:21:29,230
Oh my god!

4596
03:21:29,950 --> 03:21:31,070
Holy shit!

4597
03:21:31,290 --> 03:21:32,690
I fucking knew it!

4598
03:21:32,790 --> 03:21:33,810
I knew it!

4599
03:21:33,930 --> 03:21:35,130
I just needed to commit!

4600
03:21:35,590 --> 03:21:37,590
Her ult still fucking sucks!

4601
03:21:37,870 --> 03:21:39,690
But like, I fucking knew it!

4602
03:21:43,810 --> 03:21:46,770
Oh my god, her ult is still dog shit.

4603
03:21:46,850 --> 03:21:47,810
I hate her ult.

4604
03:21:50,350 --> 03:21:53,270
They say they healed Life Weaver.

4605
03:21:53,970 --> 03:21:57,150
I have the same amount of heals as him!

4606
03:21:57,250 --> 03:22:01,250
And I have 6k more damage than the Life Weaver!

4607
03:22:03,010 --> 03:22:04,830
I even think it was super chat.

4608
03:22:04,890 --> 03:22:05,550
Thank you, thank you.

4609
03:22:05,570 --> 03:22:06,490
Let's go, Life Weaver!

4610
03:22:09,430 --> 03:22:09,970
Guys.

4611
03:22:11,870 --> 03:22:14,410
Maybe I am the best Juno kit player in the world.

4612
03:22:17,310 --> 03:22:17,850
Maybe...

4613
03:22:19,030 --> 03:22:19,570
Maybe...

4614
03:22:19,570 --> 03:22:23,090
Maybe I can just play Juno the entire time.

4615
03:22:27,410 --> 03:22:27,770
Alright.

4616
03:22:32,230 --> 03:22:35,970
I saved the Life Weaver's butt too, guys!

4617
03:22:36,170 --> 03:22:37,610
Not just him!

4618
03:22:37,890 --> 03:22:39,370
Saving my life!

4619
03:22:40,110 --> 03:22:40,690
Weee!

4620
03:22:41,930 --> 03:22:42,650
Weee!

4621
03:22:57,720 --> 03:22:58,440
Okay.

4622
03:23:05,750 --> 03:23:06,590
Alright, we're fine.

4623
03:23:08,710 --> 03:23:10,210
Okay, we might not be fine.

4624
03:23:15,490 --> 03:23:17,590
Guys, we might not be fine because...

4625
03:23:22,480 --> 03:23:23,880
We might not be fine.

4626
03:23:24,340 --> 03:23:26,460
We might not be as fine as I thought we were.

4627
03:23:32,580 --> 03:23:34,720
We might not be as fine as I thought I was.

4628
03:23:35,040 --> 03:23:35,940
Wait, we got point?

4629
03:23:37,940 --> 03:23:40,840
Wait, I'm a fucking amazing Juno player!

4630
03:23:43,380 --> 03:23:44,200
Wait, I'm her!

4631
03:23:47,080 --> 03:23:48,160
Holy shit!

4632
03:23:52,900 --> 03:23:53,440
Wait!

4633
03:23:54,480 --> 03:23:57,200
I might just be like a prodigy Juno!

4634
03:23:59,560 --> 03:24:02,320
Alright, it's time to use the most fucking useless hull in the world.

4635
03:24:10,670 --> 03:24:11,690
That's fucking right.

4636
03:24:11,770 --> 03:24:12,410
What you gonna do?

4637
03:24:13,470 --> 03:24:14,350
Go fast!

4638
03:24:14,850 --> 03:24:15,650
Go fast!

4639
03:24:18,370 --> 03:24:19,450
This was the issue.

4640
03:24:20,010 --> 03:24:23,330
I should have 100% be playing Juno this entire time.

4641
03:24:23,610 --> 03:24:25,410
I was the Juno guy.

4642
03:24:29,820 --> 03:24:31,100
Alright, that's fine.

4643
03:24:31,180 --> 03:24:32,200
He has ult, by the way.

4644
03:24:32,320 --> 03:24:33,020
Yep, I...

4645
03:24:34,280 --> 03:24:34,820
Yep.

4646
03:24:34,820 --> 03:24:35,360
Yep.

4647
03:24:35,520 --> 03:24:36,060
Yep.

4648
03:24:37,920 --> 03:24:39,180
Look at them!

4649
03:24:39,340 --> 03:24:41,760
They purposely targeted me because I'm her!

4650
03:24:44,640 --> 03:24:46,880
That was one... oh shit!

4651
03:24:51,980 --> 03:24:55,160
That was 100% on purpose.

4652
03:24:55,740 --> 03:24:56,780
I mean...

4653
03:25:00,680 --> 03:25:02,140
I fucking knew it.

4654
03:25:02,180 --> 03:25:05,760
They 100% focused me because I was just that good, guys.

4655
03:25:06,160 --> 03:25:08,300
I was just that good.

4656
03:25:08,920 --> 03:25:11,800
Why didn't I play Juno sooner?

4657
03:25:12,220 --> 03:25:12,900
Chat!

4658
03:25:17,220 --> 03:25:17,900
No!

4659
03:25:18,160 --> 03:25:18,660
No!

4660
03:25:18,740 --> 03:25:20,860
They just WP'd into us!

4661
03:25:20,860 --> 03:25:22,000
Please!

4662
03:25:22,360 --> 03:25:24,180
We lost the first seed!

4663
03:25:24,200 --> 03:25:25,960
I couldn't do anything about it!

4664
03:25:27,120 --> 03:25:27,720
Alright...

4665
03:25:27,720 --> 03:25:28,260
No!

4666
03:25:28,380 --> 03:25:29,140
I don't need a swap!

4667
03:25:30,960 --> 03:25:32,960
I don't need a swap, guys.

4668
03:25:33,040 --> 03:25:33,380
I'm her.

4669
03:25:35,480 --> 03:25:36,740
You don't understand.

4670
03:25:37,540 --> 03:25:40,060
I'm literally the Juno player.

4671
03:25:42,980 --> 03:25:43,580
Okay...

4672
03:25:45,160 --> 03:25:45,760
Okay...

4673
03:25:45,760 --> 03:25:49,280
You guys should swap, maybe.

4674
03:25:52,900 --> 03:25:54,440
Okay, now I'm a little concerned.

4675
03:25:55,080 --> 03:25:57,760
What the fuck?!

4676
03:26:03,920 --> 03:26:05,900
There's a soldier behind us?!

4677
03:26:05,900 --> 03:26:08,040
Hey, uh, Juno, can you please kill me?

4678
03:26:14,660 --> 03:26:16,040
Now definitely won't heal her.

4679
03:26:16,240 --> 03:26:17,600
If you're not gonna heal me, I'm not gonna heal you.

4680
03:26:17,760 --> 03:26:18,420
Okay, sure.

4681
03:26:20,920 --> 03:26:21,600
Let's do it.

4682
03:26:23,860 --> 03:26:26,920
Bro, if you think I'm not that spiteful, I actually will be.

4683
03:26:29,640 --> 03:26:35,020
Bro, that's like things you say to people to make sure they definitely won't heal.

4684
03:26:35,180 --> 03:26:40,360
Like, why would I heal you now for being such a spiteful bitch?

4685
03:26:42,160 --> 03:26:46,100
Little does she know, I'm also as equally spiteful.

4686
03:26:51,080 --> 03:26:52,360
Holy shit!

4687
03:26:53,220 --> 03:26:57,000
Little does she know, now I definitely won't heal her.

4688
03:27:02,340 --> 03:27:03,860
That's my OG.

4689
03:27:06,860 --> 03:27:11,520
All I'm saying is that she could have said it much more politely.

4690
03:27:12,860 --> 03:27:17,120
She could have 100% said that much more politely.

4691
03:27:20,920 --> 03:27:22,560
Juno does not heal.

4692
03:27:22,900 --> 03:27:24,460
Juno now DPS.

4693
03:27:24,460 --> 03:27:24,840
Yes.

4694
03:27:26,180 --> 03:27:28,480
She messes around Juno.

4695
03:27:34,400 --> 03:27:36,880
She would be like, oh hey Juno, can you heal me?

4696
03:27:37,000 --> 03:27:37,560
And I'll be like, okay.

4697
03:27:40,200 --> 03:27:41,820
I literally out-healed her too.

4698
03:27:46,820 --> 03:27:49,420
Aww, that's unlucky.

4699
03:27:50,600 --> 03:27:52,200
Ooh, that's very unlucky.

4700
03:27:57,080 --> 03:27:59,060
No, that was an accident!

4701
03:28:10,760 --> 03:28:12,840
Alright, I didn't mean to heal her there.

4702
03:28:14,620 --> 03:28:15,420
Alright, let's go.

4703
03:28:18,880 --> 03:28:20,340
Ooh, that's a lot.

4704
03:28:22,120 --> 03:28:22,680
Alright.

4705
03:28:22,960 --> 03:28:24,680
I need the speed there.

4706
03:28:27,040 --> 03:28:27,980
Holy shit.

4707
03:28:30,520 --> 03:28:32,380
Just gonna give them heals first.

4708
03:28:32,820 --> 03:28:33,890
So then I can...

4709
03:28:37,180 --> 03:28:37,660
Woo!

4710
03:28:38,520 --> 03:28:40,460
Oh my god, you already got rocket barrage?

4711
03:28:40,820 --> 03:28:41,360
Jesus!

4712
03:28:41,820 --> 03:28:43,060
Oh shit!

4713
03:28:43,200 --> 03:28:45,880
I did not even realize they had a Bastion!

4714
03:28:46,280 --> 03:28:47,820
I didn't even notice!

4715
03:28:49,340 --> 03:28:52,560
I didn't even notice the Bastion existed!

4716
03:28:52,560 --> 03:28:54,080
I've not seen...

4717
03:28:54,080 --> 03:28:56,740
I've not seen them at all!

4718
03:28:57,560 --> 03:28:58,120
Okay.

4719
03:28:58,560 --> 03:29:00,180
Okay, Juno's not working now.

4720
03:29:02,300 --> 03:29:03,620
Oh, he definitely has ult.

4721
03:29:07,960 --> 03:29:10,000
It would be very unfortunate if...

4722
03:29:10,820 --> 03:29:12,620
If she gets killed there.

4723
03:29:13,320 --> 03:29:14,620
Oh, where are we going?

4724
03:29:15,960 --> 03:29:17,500
Where the fuck are we going?

4725
03:29:24,700 --> 03:29:25,260
Alright.

4726
03:29:26,900 --> 03:29:27,580
It's fine.

4727
03:29:27,640 --> 03:29:28,220
I got you!

4728
03:29:29,340 --> 03:29:31,020
Okay, I don't got you anymore.

4729
03:29:31,460 --> 03:29:33,760
Okay, I definitely don't got you anymore.

4730
03:29:37,080 --> 03:29:40,460
Okay, it's time to play Kiriko.

4731
03:29:41,180 --> 03:29:41,700
Actually...

4732
03:29:41,700 --> 03:29:43,020
Yeah, no Kiriko.

4733
03:29:43,580 --> 03:29:44,100
Alright.

4734
03:29:49,300 --> 03:29:49,820
Wait.

4735
03:29:50,200 --> 03:29:50,720
Oh!

4736
03:29:51,300 --> 03:29:51,980
That's unlucky.

4737
03:29:54,100 --> 03:29:55,620
Let me balance you out!

4738
03:29:56,580 --> 03:29:57,020
Alright,

4739
03:30:01,900 --> 03:30:02,340
here we go.

4740
03:30:03,580 --> 03:30:04,480
Does he have ult?

4741
03:30:04,640 --> 03:30:05,360
I can't tell.

4742
03:30:05,540 --> 03:30:06,960
I don't remember if he used it or not.

4743
03:30:07,780 --> 03:30:09,560
Alright, I guess I'll do this.

4744
03:30:10,580 --> 03:30:12,200
God, this is definitely not enough heals.

4745
03:30:12,280 --> 03:30:13,240
Holy shit.

4746
03:30:14,040 --> 03:30:15,480
Kiriko does not do enough.

4747
03:30:16,100 --> 03:30:17,100
Oh my god.

4748
03:30:19,380 --> 03:30:20,720
I had to do this.

4749
03:30:22,900 --> 03:30:23,660
Oh nice.

4750
03:30:25,520 --> 03:30:26,620
Oh that's awkward.

4751
03:30:28,820 --> 03:30:29,800
Oh we got a point.

4752
03:30:36,320 --> 03:30:38,360
Alright, you go this way, I'll go this way.

4753
03:30:40,400 --> 03:30:42,900
You go... Alright.

4754
03:30:44,460 --> 03:30:44,980
Hello.

4755
03:30:53,360 --> 03:30:54,420
Oh my god.

4756
03:30:54,660 --> 03:30:55,960
Wait, does he have refraud?

4757
03:30:56,200 --> 03:30:57,760
Oh, wait, wait, unless!

4758
03:30:57,760 --> 03:30:58,080
Unless!

4759
03:30:59,020 --> 03:30:59,640
Wait!

4760
03:31:00,380 --> 03:31:01,480
Oh no, it's not possible.

4761
03:31:01,660 --> 03:31:03,300
No, it's not possible.

4762
03:31:03,560 --> 03:31:05,220
No, it's definitely not.

4763
03:31:05,400 --> 03:31:07,040
There's not enough heals for this.

4764
03:31:08,380 --> 03:31:09,000
Unless?!

4765
03:31:09,000 --> 03:31:11,280
Unless!!!

4766
03:31:16,670 --> 03:31:17,450
Here we go.

4767
03:31:18,270 --> 03:31:18,890
Alright.

4768
03:31:27,480 --> 03:31:28,280
It's fine.

4769
03:31:30,650 --> 03:31:31,280
That's fine.

4770
03:31:32,260 --> 03:31:33,240
That's fine.

4771
03:31:34,040 --> 03:31:34,540
Oh, thank god!

4772
03:31:34,540 --> 03:31:34,540
No!

4773
03:31:35,640 --> 03:31:36,620
We won!

4774
03:31:37,860 --> 03:31:39,020
Wait, no, we didn't.

4775
03:31:39,080 --> 03:31:40,180
Wait, we're 44.

4776
03:31:40,400 --> 03:31:40,840
Never mind.

4777
03:31:41,080 --> 03:31:42,000
Oh, thank god.

4778
03:31:45,740 --> 03:31:48,140
I was gonna say, I wanna play one more round.

4779
03:31:51,820 --> 03:31:54,800
I was saying, I really actually wanna play one more round of this.

4780
03:32:00,640 --> 03:32:02,160
There's definitely not enough heals.

4781
03:32:02,320 --> 03:32:03,180
Not gonna lie.

4782
03:32:03,180 --> 03:32:05,740
We have not enough heals for this.

4783
03:32:11,580 --> 03:32:13,440
No, there's... yeah, we're fucked.

4784
03:32:17,620 --> 03:32:18,420
It's time.

4785
03:32:18,860 --> 03:32:19,460
Yes!

4786
03:32:20,080 --> 03:32:21,540
Another fight!

4787
03:32:22,080 --> 03:32:23,820
We get another round!

4788
03:32:23,940 --> 03:32:25,320
Let's fucking go!

4789
03:32:26,220 --> 03:32:27,940
Let's fucking go!

4790
03:32:30,080 --> 03:32:31,380
You know the best part?

4791
03:32:31,520 --> 03:32:33,580
She's gonna avoid me, so I don't have to waste my void slots.

4792
03:32:34,620 --> 03:32:36,060
That's the best part.

4793
03:32:36,080 --> 03:32:42,480
I know she's gonna avoid me, so I don't have to worry about it.

4794
03:32:46,440 --> 03:32:48,240
The holy shit!

4795
03:32:48,600 --> 03:32:50,940
She's so passive-aggressive!

4796
03:32:51,140 --> 03:32:52,060
This is why...

4797
03:32:53,520 --> 03:32:56,080
I don't understand why people...

4798
03:32:58,340 --> 03:33:00,220
Bro, I was playing the same game.

4799
03:33:02,800 --> 03:33:05,820
This is why, like, literally, I don't care.

4800
03:33:07,980 --> 03:33:10,740
They think I care that much about winning.

4801
03:33:10,880 --> 03:33:12,200
Be more polite.

4802
03:33:12,900 --> 03:33:13,560
Legitimately.

4803
03:33:13,700 --> 03:33:14,360
Be...

4804
03:33:18,320 --> 03:33:22,620
If we lose, by the way, it's on Kiri.

4805
03:33:22,860 --> 03:33:24,120
Holy shit!

4806
03:33:24,760 --> 03:33:25,760
Caught live!

4807
03:33:26,280 --> 03:33:27,900
The most...

4808
03:33:27,900 --> 03:33:31,240
Why is it always Mercy players that are so passive-aggressive?

4809
03:33:31,340 --> 03:33:32,080
I don't understand.

4810
03:33:32,660 --> 03:33:35,620
At least I'm not passive-aggressive to people on chat.

4811
03:33:35,900 --> 03:33:37,520
Like, I'm just doing it for stream.

4812
03:33:37,760 --> 03:33:38,320
Like...

4813
03:33:41,140 --> 03:33:43,180
I don't understand why.

4814
03:33:46,420 --> 03:33:51,160
Like, I... like, I don't understand why they're always so passive-aggressive.

4815
03:33:51,480 --> 03:33:52,920
I will find the key.

4816
03:33:53,460 --> 03:33:54,720
Be nourished.

4817
03:33:55,620 --> 03:33:59,760
Really, all they have to do is just be nice about it.

4818
03:33:59,800 --> 03:34:02,640
But she came in, like, fucking shooting right away.

4819
03:34:13,630 --> 03:34:15,610
I love that she'll avoid me, though.

4820
03:34:15,890 --> 03:34:17,050
Holy shit.

4821
03:34:17,730 --> 03:34:18,850
I'm so happy.

4822
03:34:20,130 --> 03:34:22,750
I don't have to waste my avoid slot.

4823
03:34:27,550 --> 03:34:28,110
Okay.

4824
03:34:29,590 --> 03:34:30,190
Okay.

4825
03:34:32,500 --> 03:34:33,100
Okay.

4826
03:34:36,080 --> 03:34:36,680
Oh...

4827
03:34:36,680 --> 03:34:38,360
Come back, come back, Wind Thorn!

4828
03:34:38,920 --> 03:34:39,520
Nice.

4829
03:34:42,930 --> 03:34:43,530
Woo!

4830
03:34:46,450 --> 03:34:47,050
Okay.

4831
03:34:48,710 --> 03:34:49,310
Nice.

4832
03:34:49,950 --> 03:34:51,690
She has to heal me now!

4833
03:34:53,510 --> 03:34:54,790
That's the best part!

4834
03:34:55,110 --> 03:34:56,890
Now you have to heal me!

4835
03:34:59,550 --> 03:35:00,730
It's your all!

4836
03:35:04,050 --> 03:35:05,470
That's so cute, right?

4837
03:35:05,470 --> 03:35:07,930
You can't not heal me now, bitch!

4838
03:35:15,850 --> 03:35:17,370
Holy shit.

4839
03:35:17,610 --> 03:35:19,770
I still have more heal center!

4840
03:35:22,450 --> 03:35:25,370
Thanks for the free heals.

4841
03:35:27,290 --> 03:35:28,870
That's fucking crazy.

4842
03:35:28,870 --> 03:35:31,670
How do I still have more heals?

4843
03:35:38,450 --> 03:35:39,670
Holy shit.

4844
03:35:44,950 --> 03:35:46,850
Your fucking pocket.

4845
03:35:56,130 --> 03:35:56,810
Goodbye.

4846
03:36:00,490 --> 03:36:01,970
OH SHE HEALED ME!

4847
03:36:02,510 --> 03:36:04,370
YOU STILL HEALED ME!

4848
03:36:06,190 --> 03:36:06,870
BITCH!

4849
03:36:06,890 --> 03:36:08,150
THIS IS WHY I WIN!

4850
03:36:08,250 --> 03:36:09,030
SO BADLY!

4851
03:36:09,170 --> 03:36:11,250
I DIDN'T HEAL YOU A SINGLE TIME!

4852
03:36:11,610 --> 03:36:13,130
CAUSE I DIDN'T CARE!

4853
03:36:17,970 --> 03:36:19,750
Oh fuck, I healed her.

4854
03:36:22,350 --> 03:36:24,830
That was on instinct too.

4855
03:36:25,090 --> 03:36:28,190
That was my first heal.

4856
03:36:28,350 --> 03:36:30,910
My first heal of the day, by the way.

4857
03:36:33,130 --> 03:36:34,510
Oh my god.

4858
03:36:36,570 --> 03:36:40,370
That was actually the very first heal I did to her, too.

4859
03:36:40,550 --> 03:36:41,830
Which I thought was funny.

4860
03:36:44,030 --> 03:36:44,630
Alright.

4861
03:36:49,510 --> 03:36:51,390
Oh shit, that's my bear.

4862
03:36:51,770 --> 03:36:54,990
Oh, that's embarrassing for her.

4863
03:36:55,570 --> 03:36:58,150
Oh no, that's embarrassing for us.

4864
03:36:59,110 --> 03:37:00,290
Holy fuck.

4865
03:37:00,410 --> 03:37:00,910
Okay.

4866
03:37:02,090 --> 03:37:02,690
Okay.

4867
03:37:03,650 --> 03:37:04,250
Okay.

4868
03:37:04,250 --> 03:37:04,670
Okay.

4869
03:37:05,170 --> 03:37:05,770
Okay.

4870
03:37:06,690 --> 03:37:08,790
Oh my god, I died so fast.

4871
03:37:08,910 --> 03:37:10,390
She actually healed me.

4872
03:37:13,050 --> 03:37:13,590
Okay.

4873
03:37:15,250 --> 03:37:15,790
Nice.

4874
03:37:19,390 --> 03:37:20,330
We did it.

4875
03:37:21,350 --> 03:37:23,250
I'm okay with losing this.

4876
03:37:23,530 --> 03:37:24,070
Like...

4877
03:37:27,610 --> 03:37:28,630
How do people feel?

4878
03:37:28,730 --> 03:37:28,890
Alright.

4879
03:37:35,050 --> 03:37:35,590
Alright.

4880
03:37:36,590 --> 03:37:39,690
Because that's an avoid slot I don't have to worry about.

4881
03:37:39,730 --> 03:37:39,930
Okay.

4882
03:37:44,870 --> 03:37:45,750
Holy shit.

4883
03:37:45,970 --> 03:37:46,870
This guy...

4884
03:37:46,870 --> 03:37:47,430
They're duo'd.

4885
03:37:47,530 --> 03:37:48,230
She literally...

4886
03:37:48,230 --> 03:37:49,350
All she does is pocket him.

4887
03:37:50,990 --> 03:37:51,430
Literally...

4888
03:37:52,370 --> 03:37:52,810
Literally...

4889
03:37:53,250 --> 03:37:53,470
All...

4890
03:37:54,470 --> 03:37:55,610
Damage boost pocket.

4891
03:37:55,830 --> 03:37:56,130
They don't...

4892
03:37:56,130 --> 03:37:56,690
She doesn't...

4893
03:37:56,690 --> 03:37:57,870
The thing is, I haven't seen her...

4894
03:37:57,870 --> 03:37:58,730
Oh, there it is.

4895
03:37:58,910 --> 03:37:59,930
I was gonna say it.

4896
03:38:00,010 --> 03:38:03,070
I felt like I haven't seen her damage boost the fucking Reaper.

4897
03:38:06,450 --> 03:38:07,970
Oh, she cocked the orb.

4898
03:38:10,050 --> 03:38:10,850
Alright, goodbye.

4899
03:38:10,850 --> 03:38:13,370
Save your fucking pocket!

4900
03:38:18,440 --> 03:38:19,700
Please, Cassidy.

4901
03:38:19,800 --> 03:38:20,500
I fucking...

4902
03:38:20,500 --> 03:38:23,300
Cassidy, I'm literally leaving you now.

4903
03:38:29,020 --> 03:38:30,940
Oh my god.

4904
03:38:33,380 --> 03:38:35,860
Oh my god.

4905
03:38:38,220 --> 03:38:40,840
And I still have more heals.

4906
03:38:41,200 --> 03:38:44,360
And I

4907
03:38:48,230 --> 03:38:49,590
still did Betty.

4908
03:38:49,810 --> 03:38:50,430
I...

4909
03:38:54,030 --> 03:38:55,710
Holy shit.

4910
03:38:57,810 --> 03:38:59,290
I didn't...

4911
03:38:59,290 --> 03:39:04,490
I only healed her one time in that entire game.

4912
03:39:04,970 --> 03:39:06,470
I healed...

4913
03:39:06,470 --> 03:39:09,870
Ever since she got so toxic at me.

4914
03:39:10,010 --> 03:39:11,850
I healed...

4915
03:39:11,850 --> 03:39:14,950
I healed her one time.

4916
03:39:16,970 --> 03:39:19,810
And she healed me.

4917
03:39:19,990 --> 03:39:21,270
She won me.

4918
03:39:21,270 --> 03:39:21,490
And I had...

4919
03:39:21,490 --> 03:39:23,770
I did that win more than me.

4920
03:39:24,030 --> 03:39:25,830
I did not care.

4921
03:39:30,310 --> 03:39:31,030
Like.

4922
03:39:31,270 --> 03:39:32,250
You see this?

4923
03:39:32,530 --> 03:39:36,030
If we lose by the way, it's on Kiri.

4924
03:39:36,430 --> 03:39:37,150
Smile.

4925
03:39:37,610 --> 03:39:38,970
Holy fuck.

4926
03:39:42,590 --> 03:39:44,010
Oh, my god.

4927
03:39:45,050 --> 03:39:45,770
Oh.

4928
03:39:46,890 --> 03:39:49,310
Oh, no, he's talking about the enemy Mora.

4929
03:39:50,430 --> 03:39:51,150
I'm sorry, buddy.

4930
03:39:51,150 --> 03:39:51,250
I'm sorry.

4931
03:39:52,930 --> 03:39:54,530
She didn't follow through!

4932
03:39:54,950 --> 03:39:56,450
I followed through!

4933
03:39:57,170 --> 03:39:58,410
I followed through!

4934
03:39:58,470 --> 03:40:00,890
The only reason she got healed was because she caught my orb.

4935
03:40:01,170 --> 03:40:02,730
I was throwing a heal orb.

4936
03:40:09,090 --> 03:40:10,210
Holy shit.

4937
03:40:10,390 --> 03:40:12,330
I can literally play the same game.

4938
03:40:12,510 --> 03:40:15,770
She thinks I care about my emo today.

4939
03:40:21,250 --> 03:40:22,470
Oh my god.

4940
03:40:29,370 --> 03:40:31,610
That's satisfying to watch.

4941
03:40:33,150 --> 03:40:35,490
She thought she could outspite Doki.

4942
03:40:35,590 --> 03:40:36,430
What a fool.

4943
03:40:36,510 --> 03:40:38,710
What a fucking fool.

4944
03:40:39,170 --> 03:40:40,810
Thank you for the super chat, Johnny.

4945
03:40:40,910 --> 03:40:41,750
Thank you, thank you.

4946
03:40:41,990 --> 03:40:50,530
The thing is, the thing is, like, she could have been a lot nicer about asking for heals.

4947
03:40:50,590 --> 03:40:51,230
I don't know.

4948
03:40:51,250 --> 03:40:53,050
I didn't even realize she needed heals.

4949
03:40:53,470 --> 03:40:59,290
Because, like, I didn't even notice until she was like, um, can you, like, heal me?

4950
03:40:59,410 --> 03:41:00,030
Do you know?

4951
03:41:01,430 --> 03:41:03,870
Or like, I won't heal you if you don't.

4952
03:41:03,870 --> 03:41:04,690
And I'm like, what?

4953
03:41:08,530 --> 03:41:11,410
I was just like, what?

4954
03:41:11,850 --> 03:41:13,570
Why are you so passive aggressive?

4955
03:41:17,750 --> 03:41:20,310
Yeah, I'd be like, hey, can you, like, heal?

4956
03:41:20,310 --> 03:41:21,590
Or can you peel for me?

4957
03:41:21,690 --> 03:41:22,470
And I'll be like, okay.

4958
03:41:22,590 --> 03:41:24,270
No, thank you for telling me.

4959
03:41:30,570 --> 03:41:31,050
Yeah.

4960
03:41:31,290 --> 03:41:35,730
She could have just, like, fucking asked nicely.

4961
03:41:38,890 --> 03:41:39,910
Oh my god.

4962
03:41:40,190 --> 03:41:41,030
I don't understand.

4963
03:41:41,550 --> 03:41:43,450
They're always so passive aggressive, too.

4964
03:41:46,210 --> 03:41:48,010
I have so many, like...

4965
03:41:48,490 --> 03:41:50,610
It's either tank players or...

4966
03:41:50,610 --> 03:41:52,030
It's either, like...

4967
03:41:52,030 --> 03:41:52,530
Uh, no.

4968
03:41:52,650 --> 03:41:53,170
Actually, no.

4969
03:41:53,170 --> 03:41:54,990
It's, like, specific players.

4970
03:41:55,270 --> 03:41:55,990
Rein players?

4971
03:41:56,690 --> 03:41:57,210
Rein?

4972
03:41:57,870 --> 03:42:00,250
Rein players can be passive aggressive, too.

4973
03:42:00,430 --> 03:42:01,910
And then, um...

4974
03:42:04,980 --> 03:42:07,500
And then, like, uh, Widow players.

4975
03:42:09,880 --> 03:42:10,400
Uh...

4976
03:42:10,400 --> 03:42:12,400
And then there's also...

4977
03:42:12,400 --> 03:42:14,240
But then Mercy players for support.

4978
03:42:16,780 --> 03:42:18,700
You know, thank you for the five gift ships.

4979
03:42:18,940 --> 03:42:19,180
Thank you.

4980
03:42:19,200 --> 03:42:19,680
Thank you.

4981
03:42:19,680 --> 03:42:19,800
Thank you.

4982
03:42:22,840 --> 03:42:23,480
Yay!

4983
03:42:25,560 --> 03:42:26,840
Thank you.

4984
03:42:26,840 --> 03:42:27,640
No, there's some...

4985
03:42:27,640 --> 03:42:29,320
Passive aggressive DPS players.

4986
03:42:29,820 --> 03:42:30,460
Uh...

4987
03:42:30,460 --> 03:42:31,180
Genji...

4988
03:42:31,180 --> 03:42:32,940
Genji and Widows.

4989
03:42:33,080 --> 03:42:34,440
They're super passive aggressive.

4990
03:42:34,920 --> 03:42:36,560
I think it's because, like...

4991
03:42:36,560 --> 03:42:38,820
I only think it's, like, heroes that get...

4992
03:42:39,240 --> 03:42:40,640
You know who are the chillest people?

4993
03:42:41,240 --> 03:42:44,200
Torb one tricks and Symmetra one tricks.

4994
03:42:45,920 --> 03:42:46,560
There...

4995
03:42:46,560 --> 03:42:49,660
Torb and Symmetra one tricks are so chill.

4996
03:42:50,280 --> 03:42:50,720
They're so chill.

4997
03:42:50,720 --> 03:42:54,580
Because they always have to experience so much hate that they just don't care.

4998
03:42:54,860 --> 03:42:57,080
They literally don't care.

4999
03:43:00,460 --> 03:43:04,440
They're so chill because they're like, well, I'm already the problem, so...

5000
03:43:05,560 --> 03:43:08,560
They're just like, I know I'm the problem, so like, I don't care.

5001
03:43:16,220 --> 03:43:17,100
Holy fuck.

5002
03:43:17,220 --> 03:43:18,940
That was my favorite game, honestly.

5003
03:43:18,940 --> 03:43:22,720
That was literally my favorite game of today.

5004
03:43:27,820 --> 03:43:29,660
Oh my god, this bitch.

5005
03:43:41,460 --> 03:43:45,980
I wish I played against her.

5006
03:43:47,140 --> 03:43:48,420
That's all I wanted.

5007
03:43:51,600 --> 03:43:53,460
I wish I played against her.

5008
03:44:08,450 --> 03:44:09,310
Goddamn.

5009
03:44:13,070 --> 03:44:13,930
Alright.

5010
03:44:18,750 --> 03:44:20,550
That would have been so funny.

5011
03:44:22,630 --> 03:44:23,490
Woo!

5012
03:44:24,270 --> 03:44:24,770
Woo!

5013
03:44:27,950 --> 03:44:28,430
Whee!

5014
03:44:29,790 --> 03:44:34,510
Yeah, but when you avoid me, there's a chance you get in my... you get on the opposite team.

5015
03:44:35,590 --> 03:44:39,350
That's why I was hoping... because I knew she was 100% avoiding me.

5016
03:44:39,730 --> 03:44:45,490
Like, I knew... I knew she 100% already wasted her avoid slots on me.

5017
03:44:45,790 --> 03:44:47,250
So that means I can...

5018
03:44:48,810 --> 03:44:50,830
Oh, that's an arrow right there.

5019
03:44:51,850 --> 03:44:53,170
That's an arrow right there.

5020
03:44:54,390 --> 03:44:54,870
Yo!

5021
03:44:54,870 --> 03:44:54,970
Boom.

5022
03:44:56,690 --> 03:44:57,510
Oh, break.

5023
03:44:58,810 --> 03:45:00,490
That's the first break I saw today.

5024
03:45:04,460 --> 03:45:04,980
Wait.

5025
03:45:05,120 --> 03:45:06,900
I hear a...

5026
03:45:06,900 --> 03:45:07,800
Yep, there it...

5027
03:45:09,920 --> 03:45:10,820
There he is.

5028
03:45:12,560 --> 03:45:13,800
Oh, he's so low!

5029
03:45:15,900 --> 03:45:16,940
Get gripped.

5030
03:45:19,820 --> 03:45:21,180
It was so low!

5031
03:45:22,140 --> 03:45:23,200
Oh, shit.

5032
03:45:23,300 --> 03:45:24,080
Okay, goodbye.

5033
03:45:24,560 --> 03:45:26,140
Guess no grippers for you.

5034
03:45:28,760 --> 03:45:29,960
Oh, shit.

5035
03:45:30,080 --> 03:45:30,660
Oh, shit.

5036
03:45:30,780 --> 03:45:31,760
My bad.

5037
03:45:36,790 --> 03:45:37,890
Slowly float away.

5038
03:45:37,970 --> 03:45:38,190
No!

5039
03:45:38,890 --> 03:45:40,410
I was like...

5040
03:45:40,410 --> 03:45:41,670
Slowly float away?

5041
03:45:46,510 --> 03:45:48,450
I was just like...

5042
03:45:48,450 --> 03:45:48,710
Yay.

5043
03:45:49,370 --> 03:45:51,230
Nobody's gonna kill me, right?

5044
03:45:54,010 --> 03:45:54,730
Bye.

5045
03:45:59,110 --> 03:45:59,830
Okay.

5046
03:45:59,830 --> 03:46:02,530
Okay, I thought the... I thought I would get more...

5047
03:46:03,590 --> 03:46:04,670
Did I go through this?

5048
03:46:04,850 --> 03:46:05,150
I did.

5049
03:46:05,270 --> 03:46:05,450
Okay.

5050
03:46:06,270 --> 03:46:07,010
Oh, he's one!

5051
03:46:09,930 --> 03:46:10,930
That's fucking right.

5052
03:46:12,090 --> 03:46:12,610
What?!

5053
03:46:16,610 --> 03:46:17,130
Oh

5054
03:46:24,160 --> 03:46:24,680
fuck!

5055
03:46:25,680 --> 03:46:26,720
Oh no!

5056
03:46:26,880 --> 03:46:29,220
I hope I don't get a noise complaint!

5057
03:46:30,380 --> 03:46:31,740
Oh, I fucked up!

5058
03:46:32,240 --> 03:46:36,760
For hours, I never closed my door!

5059
03:46:36,760 --> 03:46:37,880
Oh

5060
03:46:41,640 --> 03:46:42,240
no!

5061
03:46:42,340 --> 03:46:43,600
No, my glass door!

5062
03:46:43,960 --> 03:46:45,220
Oh no!

5063
03:46:51,380 --> 03:46:54,020
The door was never closed!

5064
03:46:54,600 --> 03:46:57,000
Oh, I'm sorry if I get a noise complaint.

5065
03:47:01,500 --> 03:47:02,640
Oh, fuck.

5066
03:47:05,340 --> 03:47:05,680
Goodbye.

5067
03:47:05,920 --> 03:47:07,240
You were so dead.

5068
03:47:09,300 --> 03:47:10,360
You were so dead.

5069
03:47:13,000 --> 03:47:13,580
You were so dead.

5070
03:47:13,580 --> 03:47:14,520
Oh, that is awkward.

5071
03:47:14,760 --> 03:47:16,260
That is actually so awkward.

5072
03:47:17,680 --> 03:47:18,260
Woo!

5073
03:47:18,860 --> 03:47:19,440
Goodbye.

5074
03:47:22,680 --> 03:47:23,840
Oh, shit!

5075
03:47:23,900 --> 03:47:25,240
Okay, now I'm here, I guess.

5076
03:47:25,560 --> 03:47:26,660
This ends now.

5077
03:47:33,760 --> 03:47:34,340
Grip.

5078
03:47:40,180 --> 03:47:40,980
I am!

5079
03:47:41,260 --> 03:47:41,940
Don't worry!

5080
03:47:43,100 --> 03:47:44,200
Sending the nuke!

5081
03:47:44,800 --> 03:47:46,360
Oh, okay, I wasted that.

5082
03:47:51,200 --> 03:47:52,200
I... I...

5083
03:47:52,200 --> 03:47:53,080
Whoops.

5084
03:47:54,940 --> 03:47:58,080
It's not a waste if that fucking...

5085
03:47:58,980 --> 03:48:00,520
If this ult means nothing.

5086
03:48:02,340 --> 03:48:03,520
It's never a waste.

5087
03:48:04,120 --> 03:48:05,760
Because this ult does nothing.

5088
03:48:08,560 --> 03:48:09,060
Whoops.

5089
03:48:15,400 --> 03:48:16,260
Alright, nice.

5090
03:48:17,360 --> 03:48:18,280
Alright, we're fine.

5091
03:48:18,920 --> 03:48:19,940
We're not fine.

5092
03:48:22,020 --> 03:48:23,080
Fly through it!

5093
03:48:24,780 --> 03:48:25,680
He's so low!

5094
03:48:26,940 --> 03:48:27,920
He's so low!

5095
03:48:30,740 --> 03:48:32,180
I'm learning how to player!

5096
03:48:33,780 --> 03:48:34,560
It's not a waste.

5097
03:48:34,960 --> 03:48:37,560
It's a bad ult anyway, so it's not a waste.

5098
03:48:38,360 --> 03:48:38,880
Exactly.

5099
03:48:44,040 --> 03:48:44,560
Alright.

5100
03:48:45,500 --> 03:48:46,020
Lightspeed.

5101
03:48:46,220 --> 03:48:46,720
Lightspeed.

5102
03:48:47,800 --> 03:48:48,320
Lightspeed.

5103
03:48:49,460 --> 03:48:49,980
Lightspeed.

5104
03:48:49,980 --> 03:48:50,780
Okay, we're doing pretty good.

5105
03:48:50,880 --> 03:48:51,460
Not gonna lie.

5106
03:48:53,280 --> 03:48:53,760
Okay.

5107
03:48:54,540 --> 03:48:56,480
Like, I'm doing enough healings, I think.

5108
03:48:58,420 --> 03:48:59,580
I'll just do that for now.

5109
03:49:00,780 --> 03:49:01,500
Get healed.

5110
03:49:01,560 --> 03:49:01,880
Get healed.

5111
03:49:02,620 --> 03:49:03,620
What do you mean throwing?

5112
03:49:05,620 --> 03:49:07,080
How am I throwing?

5113
03:49:07,280 --> 03:49:08,900
I'm doing my job.

5114
03:49:09,280 --> 03:49:10,320
As a healer.

5115
03:49:14,020 --> 03:49:14,500
How?

5116
03:49:14,520 --> 03:49:14,740
Oh!

5117
03:49:15,460 --> 03:49:15,940
Goodbye.

5118
03:49:16,980 --> 03:49:17,840
There's no way.

5119
03:49:20,100 --> 03:49:22,240
Sorry Hanzo, I had to fucking go.

5120
03:49:27,420 --> 03:49:27,940
Alright.

5121
03:49:29,100 --> 03:49:29,620
Okay.

5122
03:49:30,120 --> 03:49:30,640
I...

5123
03:49:32,120 --> 03:49:32,640
Jesus!

5124
03:49:34,300 --> 03:49:36,240
He really wanted to kill me.

5125
03:49:36,480 --> 03:49:37,680
Holy shit.

5126
03:49:38,580 --> 03:49:39,100
Okay.

5127
03:49:39,160 --> 03:49:39,340
Okay.

5128
03:49:39,380 --> 03:49:41,700
After this ult, I'll swap off Juno.

5129
03:49:45,040 --> 03:49:49,660
Guys, after this ult, I swear to God, I'll swap off Juno.

5130
03:49:50,240 --> 03:49:51,680
Like, this time, for real.

5131
03:49:51,820 --> 03:49:52,680
Like, I'm not fucking...

5132
03:49:52,680 --> 03:49:54,020
I'm not joking this time.

5133
03:49:57,500 --> 03:49:58,760
It's orbit time.

5134
03:49:59,480 --> 03:50:02,220
Oh, he hit the car!

5135
03:50:02,420 --> 03:50:03,340
He hit the car!

5136
03:50:04,000 --> 03:50:05,720
He hit the car!

5137
03:50:06,840 --> 03:50:08,200
Holy shit!

5138
03:50:09,620 --> 03:50:11,920
He actually hit the car!

5139
03:50:17,480 --> 03:50:19,220
He couldn't hit me!

5140
03:50:22,680 --> 03:50:23,300
That's funny.

5141
03:50:24,760 --> 03:50:25,920
That's pretty funny.

5142
03:50:30,410 --> 03:50:31,640
Oh, this might be where I die.

5143
03:50:35,620 --> 03:50:37,940
Life did not protect me.

5144
03:50:38,660 --> 03:50:39,820
Oh, he did it!

5145
03:50:42,520 --> 03:50:45,780
Wait, that means I can stay on Juno!

5146
03:50:52,920 --> 03:50:53,860
Oh my god!

5147
03:50:54,640 --> 03:50:56,580
I think I'm not the problem.

5148
03:50:56,780 --> 03:50:57,980
So I can stay on Juno.

5149
03:50:58,240 --> 03:50:59,380
I'm not the problem.

5150
03:51:10,390 --> 03:51:11,970
I can't believe it.

5151
03:51:11,990 --> 03:51:16,590
When we finally figured out the strat, life just got so much easier.

5152
03:51:16,750 --> 03:51:17,630
It really did.

5153
03:51:20,550 --> 03:51:23,350
I want to add that Mercy as a friend.

5154
03:51:25,750 --> 03:51:27,930
So then I can purposely...

5155
03:51:27,930 --> 03:51:32,510
I can talk to her and be like, Hey!

5156
03:51:32,670 --> 03:51:33,390
And smile.

5157
03:51:35,770 --> 03:51:36,350
Alright.

5158
03:51:38,450 --> 03:51:39,850
You're so evil!

5159
03:51:45,250 --> 03:51:45,830
Alright.

5160
03:51:46,710 --> 03:51:47,870
This Mercy...

5161
03:51:47,870 --> 03:51:51,410
She lives rent-free in my head ever since.

5162
03:51:51,690 --> 03:51:55,610
I hope I live rent-free in her head as much as she lives rent-free in my head.

5163
03:52:00,110 --> 03:52:01,510
I never forget.

5164
03:52:01,910 --> 03:52:02,910
That's the thing.

5165
03:52:03,290 --> 03:52:05,210
I never forget.

5166
03:52:13,200 --> 03:52:13,720
Alright.

5167
03:52:18,040 --> 03:52:18,880
Sniper, okay.

5168
03:52:24,900 --> 03:52:25,420
Alright.

5169
03:52:27,720 --> 03:52:28,240
Jesus!

5170
03:52:28,300 --> 03:52:30,680
I just realized how much fucking ammo I have.

5171
03:52:30,680 --> 03:52:31,200
Whoa!

5172
03:52:40,220 --> 03:52:41,660
Are we still here?

5173
03:52:45,080 --> 03:52:45,660
Alright.

5174
03:52:45,840 --> 03:52:48,180
There's so much ammo for healing though.

5175
03:52:48,340 --> 03:52:48,960
Not gonna lie.

5176
03:52:50,940 --> 03:52:52,360
Just gonna do that for now.

5177
03:52:52,640 --> 03:52:53,640
While I reload.

5178
03:52:55,280 --> 03:52:55,860
Oh!

5179
03:52:55,980 --> 03:52:56,880
That's unfortunate!

5180
03:52:57,600 --> 03:52:58,460
That's unfortunate!

5181
03:53:00,780 --> 03:53:02,180
Back up if you need to!

5182
03:53:05,200 --> 03:53:05,920
It's fine.

5183
03:53:09,180 --> 03:53:09,960
We're okay.

5184
03:53:16,930 --> 03:53:17,450
Oh!

5185
03:53:17,550 --> 03:53:18,590
This is not good for me.

5186
03:53:19,130 --> 03:53:19,650
Woo!

5187
03:53:24,120 --> 03:53:24,640
Alright!

5188
03:53:24,740 --> 03:53:25,100
Let's go!

5189
03:53:25,640 --> 03:53:26,000
Oh!

5190
03:53:26,760 --> 03:53:27,700
Let's not go.

5191
03:53:28,580 --> 03:53:29,260
Let's go!

5192
03:53:29,660 --> 03:53:30,180
Oh!

5193
03:53:31,360 --> 03:53:31,880
Oh!

5194
03:53:32,220 --> 03:53:32,880
It's fine.

5195
03:53:33,200 --> 03:53:35,100
They knew I was the problem!

5196
03:53:36,300 --> 03:53:36,820
What?

5197
03:53:36,880 --> 03:53:38,720
They knew I was the problem!

5198
03:53:38,860 --> 03:53:39,820
Did chat break?

5199
03:53:39,920 --> 03:53:40,340
Did it?

5200
03:53:42,880 --> 03:53:43,400
Let's go!

5201
03:53:43,400 --> 03:53:43,700
Let's go!

5202
03:53:44,000 --> 03:53:44,520
Let's go!

5203
03:53:44,680 --> 03:53:44,940
Let's go!

5204
03:53:45,080 --> 03:53:45,600
Let's go!

5205
03:53:45,600 --> 03:53:46,720
Let's go!

5206
03:53:46,720 --> 03:53:47,860
Let's go!

5207
03:53:48,080 --> 03:53:48,600
Let's go!

5208
03:53:52,240 --> 03:53:52,760
Okay.

5209
03:53:54,360 --> 03:53:55,040
It's alright.

5210
03:53:55,160 --> 03:53:55,440
They know.

5211
03:53:58,000 --> 03:53:58,820
The thing that...

5212
03:53:58,820 --> 03:54:00,360
What I like is there's no falloff too.

5213
03:54:00,660 --> 03:54:02,160
There's no falloff damage...

5214
03:54:02,160 --> 03:54:03,100
Fall off for Juno.

5215
03:54:10,400 --> 03:54:10,920
Yeah!

5216
03:54:10,980 --> 03:54:11,760
Destroy him!

5217
03:54:12,220 --> 03:54:13,240
Oh shit!

5218
03:54:14,120 --> 03:54:14,880
I'm okay.

5219
03:54:16,600 --> 03:54:17,740
Everything is fine.

5220
03:54:17,900 --> 03:54:18,400
Okay!

5221
03:54:18,400 --> 03:54:19,820
Oh my god!

5222
03:54:21,060 --> 03:54:22,700
Someone please!

5223
03:54:29,200 --> 03:54:30,200
I'm hurt!

5224
03:54:30,500 --> 03:54:31,980
I'm actually hurt!

5225
03:54:32,280 --> 03:54:33,500
Holy fuck!

5226
03:54:35,280 --> 03:54:36,780
I'm so good!

5227
03:54:37,160 --> 03:54:39,500
I'm so good at judo!

5228
03:54:41,120 --> 03:54:42,740
I'm so scared.

5229
03:54:48,400 --> 03:54:48,740
Alright.

5230
03:54:50,720 --> 03:54:53,440
I still think she's a fucking terrible character.

5231
03:54:53,580 --> 03:54:58,460
I don't think she's actually that good.

5232
03:55:02,560 --> 03:55:03,200
Okay.

5233
03:55:08,240 --> 03:55:09,120
Oh god.

5234
03:55:12,120 --> 03:55:13,300
Oh god, please Ashe.

5235
03:55:13,640 --> 03:55:14,200
No!

5236
03:55:14,260 --> 03:55:15,200
You walked back!

5237
03:55:23,500 --> 03:55:26,060
And she didn't walk backwards!

5238
03:55:26,160 --> 03:55:27,460
Holy shit!

5239
03:55:28,840 --> 03:55:29,980
That's so unlucky!

5240
03:55:30,680 --> 03:55:32,300
She walked backwards!

5241
03:55:35,160 --> 03:55:35,820
That's unlucky.

5242
03:55:35,920 --> 03:55:36,880
I don't think we can get there.

5243
03:55:38,280 --> 03:55:40,040
Yeah, we're not getting there.

5244
03:55:44,600 --> 03:55:45,120
No,

5245
03:55:49,890 --> 03:55:50,850
do you have healing with gun?

5246
03:55:51,110 --> 03:55:51,890
Bro, what?

5247
03:55:52,350 --> 03:55:54,090
Ana has like sniper gun.

5248
03:55:57,070 --> 03:55:58,730
I think they all heal.

5249
03:55:58,890 --> 03:56:00,430
All of them heal with gun.

5250
03:56:00,470 --> 03:56:00,910
Almost.

5251
03:56:01,250 --> 03:56:02,170
Bap's a gun!

5252
03:56:06,510 --> 03:56:07,210
Don't worry.

5253
03:56:07,510 --> 03:56:08,530
We're going in.

5254
03:56:08,690 --> 03:56:09,770
Oh, that's unlucky.

5255
03:56:10,390 --> 03:56:11,810
Don't worry, we're going in.

5256
03:56:14,650 --> 03:56:15,550
Oh shit!

5257
03:56:15,790 --> 03:56:16,410
Force trance!

5258
03:56:16,490 --> 03:56:16,950
Force trance!

5259
03:56:17,430 --> 03:56:18,370
Force trance!

5260
03:56:24,320 --> 03:56:26,460
Oh, he didn't want to force trance.

5261
03:56:28,060 --> 03:56:28,980
Oh shit!

5262
03:56:29,200 --> 03:56:29,780
No!

5263
03:56:29,980 --> 03:56:30,660
I got...

5264
03:56:30,660 --> 03:56:32,160
She's so low!

5265
03:56:32,660 --> 03:56:33,360
Fucking what?!

5266
03:56:38,900 --> 03:56:39,520
Okay.

5267
03:56:39,520 --> 03:56:40,780
Don't worry, we're fine.

5268
03:56:43,200 --> 03:56:44,500
Alright, we're fine.

5269
03:56:44,780 --> 03:56:46,460
What the fuck?!

5270
03:56:47,030 --> 03:56:47,820
No way!

5271
03:56:49,480 --> 03:56:51,020
He's camping me!

5272
03:56:53,880 --> 03:56:54,740
That's fucked.

5273
03:56:55,020 --> 03:56:55,820
That's actually fucked.

5274
03:56:56,780 --> 03:56:57,760
Holy shit.

5275
03:57:01,780 --> 03:57:02,330
That's fine.

5276
03:57:02,790 --> 03:57:03,830
That's not fine.

5277
03:57:03,830 --> 03:57:06,530
It was not fine, actually.

5278
03:57:06,990 --> 03:57:07,770
That's it.

5279
03:57:08,010 --> 03:57:09,730
It ended up not being as fine.

5280
03:57:09,790 --> 03:57:11,730
Are you fucking... Are you kidding me?

5281
03:57:11,870 --> 03:57:13,750
Are you kidding me?!

5282
03:57:13,750 --> 03:57:15,910
I can't be her anymore!

5283
03:57:17,210 --> 03:57:17,670
I...

5284
03:57:18,430 --> 03:57:19,150
No,

5285
03:57:22,170 --> 03:57:23,930
I can't be her.

5286
03:57:27,050 --> 03:57:28,610
That's not fair.

5287
03:57:28,610 --> 03:57:29,930
That's not fair.

5288
03:57:33,090 --> 03:57:34,270
That's not fair.

5289
03:57:35,170 --> 03:57:36,990
But I wanna be her.

5290
03:57:40,390 --> 03:57:42,150
I can't be her.

5291
03:57:47,120 --> 03:57:47,800
No!

5292
03:57:55,080 --> 03:57:57,680
I told you, they knew I was the problem.

5293
03:57:57,880 --> 03:57:59,580
What the fuck?!

5294
03:57:59,580 --> 03:58:01,500
That's just embarrassing.

5295
03:58:01,500 --> 03:58:01,880
That's just embarrassing.

5296
03:58:03,780 --> 03:58:04,900
Sad.

5297
03:58:10,530 --> 03:58:11,770
Jesus Christ.

5298
03:58:12,170 --> 03:58:14,290
Holy shit.

5299
03:58:14,610 --> 03:58:17,210
What a fucking play.

5300
03:58:18,230 --> 03:58:21,290
That's actually a crazy fucking...

5301
03:58:26,630 --> 03:58:27,250
That's fucked.

5302
03:58:27,550 --> 03:58:29,030
That's so fucked.

5303
03:58:29,230 --> 03:58:30,590
That's so fucked.

5304
03:58:33,990 --> 03:58:36,430
Guys, all I'm saying is that...

5305
03:58:37,590 --> 03:58:39,210
They targeted me.

5306
03:58:44,700 --> 03:58:45,920
She's still alive!

5307
03:58:46,660 --> 03:58:47,120
Okay.

5308
03:58:47,300 --> 03:58:48,100
That's it.

5309
03:58:48,520 --> 03:58:49,740
How the fuck?

5310
03:58:53,500 --> 03:58:54,520
Oh, shit.

5311
03:58:54,700 --> 03:58:55,500
I mean, that's fine.

5312
03:58:56,660 --> 03:58:58,100
I mean, that's fine.

5313
03:58:58,480 --> 03:59:00,040
No, that is not fine.

5314
03:59:00,540 --> 03:59:02,340
It stopped being fine.

5315
03:59:02,460 --> 03:59:05,400
It stopped being... Never mind.

5316
03:59:05,400 --> 03:59:08,420
Guys, it... It stopped being fine, guys.

5317
03:59:11,600 --> 03:59:12,360
Yay!

5318
03:59:17,360 --> 03:59:18,120
Yay!

5319
03:59:19,360 --> 03:59:21,720
I perfected the Juno strat.

5320
03:59:25,220 --> 03:59:27,780
I can't... You know what?

5321
03:59:28,360 --> 03:59:29,900
Do you think we could get to med?

5322
03:59:32,100 --> 03:59:32,860
I...

5323
03:59:32,860 --> 03:59:33,340
I...

5324
03:59:42,440 --> 03:59:45,360
I can't believe it.

5325
03:59:45,360 --> 03:59:47,040
I can't!

5326
03:59:47,040 --> 03:59:48,220
No, guys.

5327
03:59:48,540 --> 03:59:51,120
It's actually so dumb.

5328
03:59:53,140 --> 03:59:55,360
Oh, my God.

5329
03:59:55,720 --> 03:59:56,500
Oh,

5330
04:00:01,020 --> 04:00:02,380
I can't believe...

5331
04:00:02,380 --> 04:00:04,120
Oh, my God.

5332
04:00:04,120 --> 04:00:04,480
I can't believe...

5333
04:00:04,480 --> 04:00:05,380
I couldn't even master it.

5334
04:00:05,380 --> 04:00:10,460
I could have placed in Masters if I... if I like just went with it.

5335
04:00:11,380 --> 04:00:19,000
We could... oh my god, we could have been in Masters if I just picked Juno.

5336
04:00:19,400 --> 04:00:23,060
If I... if I just picked Juno.

5337
04:00:27,280 --> 04:00:30,880
The fact that I like... the fact that I was just...

5338
04:00:30,880 --> 04:00:34,160
The fact that I was just, you know...

5339
04:00:34,160 --> 04:00:38,940
I don't know if you guys know this, but I was actually fucking around, like...

5340
04:00:38,940 --> 04:00:42,200
I didn't expect that strat to actually work, you know?

5341
04:00:42,300 --> 04:00:45,560
To be like... it was just a he-he-ha-ha stream moment.

5342
04:00:45,860 --> 04:00:48,160
Where it's like, you know...

5343
04:01:00,690 --> 04:01:02,190
And it worked.

5344
04:01:03,730 --> 04:01:04,850
And it worked.

5345
04:01:04,850 --> 04:01:08,670
It can't believe it actually worked.

5346
04:01:12,240 --> 04:01:13,820
Oh my god.

5347
04:01:25,480 --> 04:01:27,900
Oh, it's the silly ideas!

5348
04:01:28,400 --> 04:01:29,660
It really is!

5349
04:01:31,480 --> 04:01:34,700
It's... it's the fucking silly ideas.

5350
04:01:35,360 --> 04:01:36,780
Alright, I'll do LG.

5351
04:01:37,100 --> 04:01:38,340
This will be my LG.

5352
04:01:38,540 --> 04:01:39,960
I wanna know...

5353
04:01:40,880 --> 04:01:41,360
Uh...

5354
04:01:44,020 --> 04:01:45,040
Maybe... I wanna know.

5355
04:01:45,240 --> 04:01:48,360
I wanna know if... if it'll work after placements.

5356
04:01:49,600 --> 04:01:50,740
I made it work.

5357
04:01:52,040 --> 04:01:54,780
I actually... I actually made it work.

5358
04:01:54,840 --> 04:02:00,060
I can't believe we had the worst start in our rank... in our... in our rank queues.

5359
04:02:00,300 --> 04:02:01,920
And everything just worked out.

5360
04:02:02,640 --> 04:02:04,440
Everything just worked out in the end.

5361
04:02:05,640 --> 04:02:09,760
I mean... five... that... you know, I thought... you know...

5362
04:02:09,760 --> 04:02:10,980
We're gonna have more than five.

5363
04:02:11,540 --> 04:02:15,260
But like... I feel... the VOD watchers are gonna be like...

5364
04:02:15,260 --> 04:02:16,920
Oh man...

5365
04:02:16,920 --> 04:02:18,760
It's gonna go be bad, isn't it?

5366
04:02:18,840 --> 04:02:19,380
But no...

5367
04:02:19,380 --> 04:02:21,020
There's always hope.

5368
04:02:21,580 --> 04:02:24,920
And there's always a light at the end of the tunnel.

5369
04:02:25,120 --> 04:02:27,100
And that is why I love Overwatch.

5370
04:02:28,040 --> 04:02:32,320
Like... I... this is why I stayed with Overwatch for this long.

5371
04:02:32,800 --> 04:02:34,220
It's a great game.

5372
04:02:34,560 --> 04:02:38,460
And like... eventually... eventually they start changing.

5373
04:02:44,420 --> 04:02:44,700
And...

5374
04:02:44,980 --> 04:02:47,540
Eventually things will work out in the end.

5375
04:02:48,440 --> 04:02:52,200
And... this is why... this is why I love playing Overwatch.

5376
04:02:54,060 --> 04:02:54,620
And...

5377
04:02:56,300 --> 04:02:59,580
And I think it's definitely one of the best CO shooters out there.

5378
04:03:00,780 --> 04:03:03,540
And... and it gave me lots of happiness.

5379
04:03:04,060 --> 04:03:04,720
You know?

5380
04:03:04,780 --> 04:03:05,680
It's tough love.

5381
04:03:05,980 --> 04:03:06,720
It's tough love.

5382
04:03:06,720 --> 04:03:09,800
At first it tried... it tried to give me like...

5383
04:03:09,800 --> 04:03:11,540
All the bad matches.

5384
04:03:11,760 --> 04:03:13,340
But it's tough... it was testing me.

5385
04:03:13,560 --> 04:03:14,920
Guys, you don't understand.

5386
04:03:15,440 --> 04:03:18,380
Overwatch was literally... he... he was testing me.

5387
04:03:18,680 --> 04:03:20,900
Testing me... my commitment to him.

5388
04:03:21,140 --> 04:03:24,280
And like... I knew if I stayed long enough...

5389
04:03:24,280 --> 04:03:26,300
There was light at the end of the tunnel.

5390
04:03:27,080 --> 04:03:30,380
And that... and that he was gonna change.

5391
04:03:30,760 --> 04:03:31,400
And he did!

5392
04:03:32,300 --> 04:03:34,420
He did... he changed.

5393
04:03:38,040 --> 04:03:40,460
Guys, you don't understand.

5394
04:03:41,480 --> 04:03:43,880
You guys don't understand.

5395
04:03:51,440 --> 04:03:52,700
Alright...

5396
04:03:54,040 --> 04:03:55,300
Alright...

5397
04:04:12,130 --> 04:04:12,760
No!

5398
04:04:13,060 --> 04:04:14,260
It's over.

5399
04:04:15,900 --> 04:04:18,360
I hesitated.

5400
04:04:18,360 --> 04:04:18,740
I did it!

5401
04:04:20,210 --> 04:04:22,440
I did it!

5402
04:04:22,440 --> 04:04:22,920
It's already over!

5403
04:04:23,240 --> 04:04:28,140
I didn't insta-lock!

5404
04:04:29,000 --> 04:04:31,480
I didn't insta-lock!

5405
04:04:34,860 --> 04:04:36,100
It's over.

5406
04:04:37,040 --> 04:04:38,560
The hesitation.

5407
04:04:39,100 --> 04:04:57,240
I was like leaning back on my chair relaxing and was like I was just relaxing but leaning back and then leaning back and then I was like hehe and they picked Juno.

5408
04:04:57,860 --> 04:04:59,220
They picked Juno.

5409
04:04:59,260 --> 04:04:59,700
It's over.

5410
04:05:01,240 --> 04:05:02,200
It's over.

5411
04:05:02,540 --> 04:05:04,300
It's already so over.

5412
04:05:10,040 --> 04:05:12,420
There's only one person that can play.

5413
04:05:14,760 --> 04:05:15,840
Oh shit!

5414
04:05:15,860 --> 04:05:16,660
What the fuck?

5415
04:05:19,280 --> 04:05:20,620
Oh my god.

5416
04:05:21,980 --> 04:05:22,660
Alright.

5417
04:05:22,780 --> 04:05:23,600
Oh shit!

5418
04:05:23,740 --> 04:05:24,540
Go Genji!

5419
04:05:24,680 --> 04:05:24,800
Go!

5420
04:05:24,900 --> 04:05:25,040
Oh.

5421
04:05:25,280 --> 04:05:26,520
Bye Genji.

5422
04:05:26,640 --> 04:05:27,540
Bye Genji.

5423
04:05:27,580 --> 04:05:27,780
Bye.

5424
04:05:28,400 --> 04:05:29,700
Please don't die.

5425
04:05:29,800 --> 04:05:31,180
Please don't die.

5426
04:05:32,160 --> 04:05:33,660
Please don't die.

5427
04:05:34,460 --> 04:05:35,140
No!

5428
04:05:36,000 --> 04:05:38,620
He's gonna be mega staggered!

5429
04:05:39,540 --> 04:05:39,980
JK.

5430
04:05:41,120 --> 04:05:42,060
Oh fuck.

5431
04:05:43,120 --> 04:05:44,040
Oh fuck.

5432
04:05:44,140 --> 04:05:44,780
Nevermind.

5433
04:05:45,520 --> 04:05:46,200
Nevermind.

5434
04:05:46,340 --> 04:05:49,100
I'm not playing Ana against this fucking hell.

5435
04:05:49,320 --> 04:05:56,780
I hate playing Ana against shields.

5436
04:05:57,820 --> 04:05:59,840
I'm so used to playing Juno.

5437
04:05:59,860 --> 04:06:01,340
I don't know how to play Ana anymore.

5438
04:06:04,120 --> 04:06:06,920
I actually don't know how to play the game anymore.

5439
04:06:11,000 --> 04:06:13,440
Juno's mobility is actually insane though.

5440
04:06:13,480 --> 04:06:13,840
I'll admit.

5441
04:06:14,260 --> 04:06:18,420
Like I was not expecting how insane Juno's mobility is.

5442
04:06:18,520 --> 04:06:21,060
She makes you feel like a butterfly.

5443
04:06:23,680 --> 04:06:24,480
No!

5444
04:06:26,320 --> 04:06:29,540
She actually makes you feel like a butterfly.

5445
04:06:30,200 --> 04:06:31,000
Juno!

5446
04:06:31,060 --> 04:06:33,260
Why didn't you shoot me Juno?

5447
04:06:34,040 --> 04:06:34,440
Juno!

5448
04:06:35,340 --> 04:06:36,140
Adam!

5449
04:06:36,480 --> 04:06:37,280
Adam!

5450
04:06:37,860 --> 04:06:39,640
I love that video.

5451
04:06:41,120 --> 04:06:42,240
I hate him.

5452
04:06:44,260 --> 04:06:45,740
I hate him.

5453
04:06:45,740 --> 04:06:47,420
You guys know that video?

5454
04:06:47,580 --> 04:06:49,400
The duck video?

5455
04:06:50,100 --> 04:06:53,220
That's how I feel when I yell at Juno.

5456
04:07:02,730 --> 04:07:03,550
It's okay.

5457
04:07:05,170 --> 04:07:06,150
It's not okay.

5458
04:07:10,020 --> 04:07:12,680
Is this how the Mercy felt playing with me?

5459
04:07:16,200 --> 04:07:19,320
Is this how she felt?

5460
04:07:19,320 --> 04:07:19,560
Nope.

5461
04:07:29,140 --> 04:07:30,760
I don't deserve that.

5462
04:07:32,740 --> 04:07:33,260
No,

5463
04:07:38,370 --> 04:07:39,350
I'm a good person.

5464
04:07:40,510 --> 04:07:41,770
I'm a good person.

5465
04:07:41,830 --> 04:07:43,550
I haven't been passive aggressive yet.

5466
04:07:46,530 --> 04:07:47,430
Oh shit.

5467
04:07:47,930 --> 04:07:48,950
Second use assault.

5468
04:07:51,170 --> 04:07:52,370
Oh wow, what is he going to do?

5469
04:07:52,490 --> 04:07:53,150
Shoot us?

5470
04:07:54,210 --> 04:07:55,110
Oh, what the fuck?

5471
04:07:55,290 --> 04:07:55,890
Oh shit!

5472
04:07:57,970 --> 04:07:58,350
Alright.

5473
04:08:00,210 --> 04:08:00,590
Nice.

5474
04:08:01,970 --> 04:08:03,550
Guys, I'm going to get my first ult soon guys.

5475
04:08:03,670 --> 04:08:04,150
This is it.

5476
04:08:04,870 --> 04:08:05,530
This is it.

5477
04:08:07,650 --> 04:08:08,030
Guys.

5478
04:08:09,770 --> 04:08:11,630
I guess I'm going to get my first ult.

5479
04:08:11,950 --> 04:08:13,570
Guys, it's going to be so cool.

5480
04:08:14,650 --> 04:08:15,850
It's going to be so fun.

5481
04:08:16,010 --> 04:08:16,290
Wow!

5482
04:08:19,310 --> 04:08:20,370
Guys, this is it.

5483
04:08:20,450 --> 04:08:21,070
The retake.

5484
04:08:21,610 --> 04:08:24,070
Guys, I'm going to get my first ult right here guys.

5485
04:08:28,610 --> 04:08:29,490
This is it.

5486
04:08:29,490 --> 04:08:30,430
It's going to be so sick.

5487
04:08:32,150 --> 04:08:33,670
My one and only ult.

5488
04:08:33,730 --> 04:08:35,130
It's going to be so fucking sick guys.

5489
04:08:35,350 --> 04:08:35,910
You don't understand.

5490
04:08:36,390 --> 04:08:38,150
Oh no, he's staggered.

5491
04:08:38,150 --> 04:08:38,610
That's bad.

5492
04:08:43,970 --> 04:08:45,090
This is it.

5493
04:08:45,650 --> 04:08:46,350
Right here.

5494
04:08:49,810 --> 04:08:50,530
Right here.

5495
04:08:51,830 --> 04:08:52,310
Whoa!

5496
04:08:52,390 --> 04:08:53,030
Right here.

5497
04:08:55,310 --> 04:08:56,490
It's still here.

5498
04:08:58,850 --> 04:09:00,110
I told you.

5499
04:09:00,490 --> 04:09:02,910
I told you it's going to be so sick.

5500
04:09:03,950 --> 04:09:05,450
It doesn't matter.

5501
04:09:05,950 --> 04:09:07,350
It doesn't matter.

5502
04:09:07,470 --> 04:09:10,330
It took me one entire game to build all of it.

5503
04:09:10,330 --> 04:09:12,110
It was a sick ass ult though.

5504
04:09:12,390 --> 04:09:14,890
It was a sick ult.

5505
04:09:23,170 --> 04:09:24,850
It worked out.

5506
04:09:24,910 --> 04:09:26,910
The ult was so fucking sick.

5507
04:09:27,850 --> 04:09:28,630
It worked out.

5508
04:09:28,630 --> 04:09:30,230
The ult was so fucking sick.

5509
04:09:30,230 --> 04:09:30,650
Alright.

5510
04:09:32,930 --> 04:09:33,990
I'm going to go Q.

5511
04:09:34,550 --> 04:09:36,210
I'll find my own path.

5512
04:09:36,590 --> 04:09:37,530
I'll find my own path.

5513
04:09:37,750 --> 04:09:40,690
It might have taken me an entire game.

5514
04:09:41,090 --> 04:09:41,870
But like...

5515
04:09:41,870 --> 04:09:45,290
But like I ulted when it mattered the most.

5516
04:09:45,510 --> 04:09:46,650
But like I ulted when it mattered the most.

5517
04:09:46,650 --> 04:09:47,870
The wicked play.

5518
04:09:49,850 --> 04:09:50,550
Yay!

5519
04:09:54,750 --> 04:09:56,150
The game...

5520
04:09:56,150 --> 04:09:56,450
Hey!

5521
04:09:56,690 --> 04:09:57,430
We won!

5522
04:09:57,530 --> 04:09:58,610
That one round.

5523
04:10:01,410 --> 04:10:04,030
We won that one round.

5524
04:10:04,370 --> 04:10:05,610
That's all that matters.

5525
04:10:05,910 --> 04:10:06,690
Jesus Christ.

5526
04:10:06,750 --> 04:10:07,830
Why is that bugging out?

5527
04:10:09,230 --> 04:10:10,530
Jesus Christ.

5528
04:10:10,550 --> 04:10:11,150
Why is that bugging out?

5529
04:10:13,290 --> 04:10:13,770
Juno.

5530
04:10:13,770 --> 04:10:14,030
Juno.

5531
04:10:14,230 --> 04:10:15,050
Don't die.

5532
04:10:15,430 --> 04:10:15,910
Juno.

5533
04:10:16,890 --> 04:10:17,370
Oh.

5534
04:10:17,530 --> 04:10:17,990
Oh.

5535
04:10:18,050 --> 04:10:18,930
I hope I don't die.

5536
04:10:20,850 --> 04:10:21,330
God.

5537
04:10:21,350 --> 04:10:23,090
My heal output is so weak.

5538
04:10:26,990 --> 04:10:27,710
I'm helping.

5539
04:10:28,490 --> 04:10:29,570
Is he going to Wraith?

5540
04:10:30,450 --> 04:10:30,930
Whoa.

5541
04:10:31,050 --> 04:10:31,530
Shit.

5542
04:10:31,630 --> 04:10:32,150
Sorry bro.

5543
04:10:33,190 --> 04:10:34,190
Sucks to be you.

5544
04:10:34,390 --> 04:10:34,830
I guess.

5545
04:10:38,010 --> 04:10:38,490
Wait.

5546
04:10:38,710 --> 04:10:39,650
Is that her?

5547
04:10:39,770 --> 04:10:40,470
My Juno?

5548
04:10:40,510 --> 04:10:41,130
Or their Juno?

5549
04:10:41,150 --> 04:10:41,370
Juno.

5550
04:10:43,530 --> 04:10:44,010
No.

5551
04:10:44,090 --> 04:10:45,010
That was our Juno.

5552
04:10:45,030 --> 04:10:46,150
That was enemy Juno.

5553
04:10:46,430 --> 04:10:47,510
Nice staggered.

5554
04:10:50,330 --> 04:10:50,810
Alright.

5555
04:10:51,250 --> 04:10:51,730
Oh.

5556
04:10:51,970 --> 04:10:52,430
Nah.

5557
04:10:52,550 --> 04:10:53,950
I'm not going to waste cleanse here.

5558
04:10:54,230 --> 04:10:54,810
I feel like...

5559
04:10:54,810 --> 04:10:56,190
Did I nerf Kiriko's heals?

5560
04:10:56,530 --> 04:10:58,370
She feels so weak.

5561
04:10:59,290 --> 04:11:00,250
Not going to lie.

5562
04:11:02,090 --> 04:11:03,690
This feels weak in general.

5563
04:11:08,430 --> 04:11:08,910
No?

5564
04:11:09,270 --> 04:11:09,750
Okay.

5565
04:11:09,970 --> 04:11:11,130
I might be just used to...

5566
04:11:11,150 --> 04:11:11,950
other healers.

5567
04:11:13,870 --> 04:11:15,870
Must not be using Juno enough then.

5568
04:11:16,070 --> 04:11:16,690
Not Juno.

5569
04:11:17,330 --> 04:11:17,810
Kiriko.

5570
04:11:18,330 --> 04:11:18,810
Sorry.

5571
04:11:18,890 --> 04:11:19,430
I meant Kiriko.

5572
04:11:20,650 --> 04:11:23,850
Did they nerf Kiriko's heals?

5573
04:11:24,070 --> 04:11:25,270
That's what I mean.

5574
04:11:26,350 --> 04:11:26,830
Sorry.

5575
04:11:26,970 --> 04:11:29,090
I have Juno brain rot right now.

5576
04:11:29,130 --> 04:11:30,710
Everything is a Juno to me.

5577
04:11:31,110 --> 04:11:33,230
I actually have Juno brain rot.

5578
04:11:36,110 --> 04:11:36,590
Nice.

5579
04:11:37,570 --> 04:11:38,050
Kiriko's...

5580
04:11:38,770 --> 04:11:41,190
Kiriko's heals feel so fucking weak.

5581
04:11:41,250 --> 04:11:41,830
Not going to lie.

5582
04:11:42,790 --> 04:11:48,410
But I don't know if it's because I've been playing Juno and other... and Ana for too long.

5583
04:11:48,710 --> 04:11:50,790
That every other character feels...

5584
04:11:51,790 --> 04:11:53,250
That her heals feel weak.

5585
04:11:54,470 --> 04:11:55,750
She's so...

5586
04:11:55,750 --> 04:11:56,310
Ha!

5587
04:11:56,390 --> 04:11:56,890
Bitch!

5588
04:11:58,370 --> 04:11:59,490
That's what you get.

5589
04:12:00,390 --> 04:12:01,030
Oh!

5590
04:12:01,810 --> 04:12:02,130
Oh!

5591
04:12:02,150 --> 04:12:02,590
Goodbye!

5592
04:12:03,290 --> 04:12:03,930
No!

5593
04:12:03,930 --> 04:12:04,110
No!

5594
04:12:05,150 --> 04:12:08,030
My cockiness has betrayed me yet again!

5595
04:12:10,070 --> 04:12:10,590
No!

5596
04:12:10,590 --> 04:12:11,270
It's okay.

5597
04:12:11,330 --> 04:12:12,010
We have ult.

5598
04:12:13,650 --> 04:12:14,370
It's fine.

5599
04:12:17,310 --> 04:12:19,170
I couldn't even cleanse.

5600
04:12:19,390 --> 04:12:20,030
It's okay.

5601
04:12:20,110 --> 04:12:20,710
We have...

5602
04:12:21,490 --> 04:12:23,230
We have the ult that matters.

5603
04:12:23,630 --> 04:12:25,770
When the fuck did we Juno ulted?

5604
04:12:26,350 --> 04:12:27,230
Holy shit.

5605
04:12:27,270 --> 04:12:28,310
I don't even remember that.

5606
04:12:30,090 --> 04:12:30,610
Alright.

5607
04:12:30,670 --> 04:12:31,130
Here we go.

5608
04:12:32,970 --> 04:12:33,490
Alright.

5609
04:12:33,930 --> 04:12:34,590
You go do your thing.

5610
04:12:34,890 --> 04:12:36,190
Because I know...

5611
04:12:36,190 --> 04:12:39,830
Did we just run away from it?

5612
04:12:40,330 --> 04:12:41,190
That's awkward.

5613
04:12:44,370 --> 04:12:46,290
I liked how...

5614
04:12:46,290 --> 04:12:46,710
Um...

5615
04:12:47,730 --> 04:12:48,710
Oh, no.

5616
04:12:48,790 --> 04:12:48,970
Wait.

5617
04:12:49,070 --> 04:12:50,350
Everybody died?

5618
04:12:50,730 --> 04:12:51,230
How?

5619
04:12:53,310 --> 04:12:55,430
How the fuck did everybody die?

5620
04:12:58,170 --> 04:12:59,330
What the fuck?

5621
04:13:00,330 --> 04:13:02,250
Bro, I don't have enough heals for this.

5622
04:13:02,530 --> 04:13:02,910
Oh!

5623
04:13:06,500 --> 04:13:07,400
What do you mean?

5624
04:13:11,860 --> 04:13:13,020
How did you all die?

5625
04:13:13,540 --> 04:13:14,700
How did you all die?

5626
04:13:17,200 --> 04:13:17,560
No!

5627
04:13:17,680 --> 04:13:18,820
I got... No, dude.

5628
04:13:18,860 --> 04:13:19,440
It's not a result.

5629
04:13:19,680 --> 04:13:20,900
Because I fucking cleansed it.

5630
04:13:21,020 --> 04:13:21,900
That's why I was so confused.

5631
04:13:23,760 --> 04:13:24,280
Don't worry.

5632
04:13:25,680 --> 04:13:26,040
Okay.

5633
04:13:26,100 --> 04:13:27,180
Maybe worry a little bit.

5634
04:13:30,120 --> 04:13:31,580
Maybe worry a little bit.

5635
04:13:32,680 --> 04:13:33,220
Oh, no.

5636
04:13:33,260 --> 04:13:34,740
I'm trying my best to keep you up.

5637
04:13:35,040 --> 04:13:38,080
There's not a lot of heals going in, but I'm doing my best.

5638
04:13:40,840 --> 04:13:42,240
Oh, that's awkward.

5639
04:13:43,720 --> 04:13:44,560
That's awkward.

5640
04:13:44,860 --> 04:13:46,300
Oh, that's...

5641
04:13:47,680 --> 04:13:49,060
That's very awkward.

5642
04:13:52,260 --> 04:13:55,900
Guys, I think it's just a Juno diff.

5643
04:13:57,340 --> 04:14:00,300
If I was on Juno, this game would be so different.

5644
04:14:03,400 --> 04:14:04,880
Yeah, it works on the result.

5645
04:14:04,880 --> 04:14:06,920
I just need to use it at the right time.

5646
04:14:07,300 --> 04:14:11,000
Like, I need to use it when he like, uh, throws his spear down.

5647
04:14:14,160 --> 04:14:15,200
Oh, god.

5648
04:14:19,010 --> 04:14:19,570
I...

5649
04:14:20,110 --> 04:14:20,390
Oh.

5650
04:14:21,030 --> 04:14:21,910
That's awkward.

5651
04:14:25,690 --> 04:14:26,790
That's very awkward.

5652
04:14:27,130 --> 04:14:28,310
That's okay, Gengu!

5653
04:14:29,190 --> 04:14:31,270
Keep slicing and dicing!

5654
04:14:31,270 --> 04:14:33,270
Keep slicing and dicing!

5655
04:14:35,730 --> 04:14:37,130
Just slice and dice!

5656
04:14:37,610 --> 04:14:37,650
Just slice and dice!

5657
04:14:37,690 --> 04:14:37,750
Just slice and dice!

5658
04:14:39,070 --> 04:14:40,210
No, I couldn't go in!

5659
04:14:40,290 --> 04:14:41,030
Tracer, this is it!

5660
04:14:41,030 --> 04:14:42,310
This is your time to shine!

5661
04:14:50,780 --> 04:14:51,540
Tracer, this is it!

5662
04:14:51,540 --> 04:14:51,600
This is your time to shine!

5663
04:14:51,620 --> 04:14:54,880
If I was on Juno, this would have been easier.

5664
04:14:55,100 --> 04:14:56,260
That's all I'm gonna say.

5665
04:14:56,480 --> 04:14:58,740
That's all I'm gonna say.

5666
04:15:03,440 --> 04:15:04,560
Alright, guys.

5667
04:15:04,680 --> 04:15:06,020
I know what to do.

5668
04:15:08,640 --> 04:15:10,400
Now nobody will die.

5669
04:15:15,580 --> 04:15:17,600
The Juno strat was legit.

5670
04:15:17,760 --> 04:15:20,180
I would play Juno if I could!

5671
04:15:20,720 --> 04:15:22,080
If I could!

5672
04:15:22,760 --> 04:15:26,780
Oh my god, I can't believe the Juno strat was the reason why I was winning.

5673
04:15:27,080 --> 04:15:28,540
I can't believe it.

5674
04:15:28,740 --> 04:15:31,240
I can't believe it really was.

5675
04:15:33,220 --> 04:15:34,520
That's so fucked.

5676
04:15:37,840 --> 04:15:39,860
That's actually so fucked.

5677
04:15:40,820 --> 04:15:42,260
Who would have thought?

5678
04:15:43,900 --> 04:15:45,700
Oh, that's the flower.

5679
04:15:48,720 --> 04:15:49,520
Alright.

5680
04:15:51,800 --> 04:15:52,600
Okay.

5681
04:15:55,760 --> 04:15:56,560
Okay.

5682
04:15:57,440 --> 04:15:58,240
Bye.

5683
04:16:05,340 --> 04:16:06,060
Okay.

5684
04:16:07,000 --> 04:16:07,720
Bye.

5685
04:16:08,240 --> 04:16:08,960
Okay.

5686
04:16:08,960 --> 04:16:08,960
Bye.

5687
04:16:08,960 --> 04:16:09,280
It's fine.

5688
04:16:12,520 --> 04:16:16,600
If nobody dies, we'll be fine.

5689
04:16:16,720 --> 04:16:18,940
I keep thinking shift is not that.

5690
04:16:19,220 --> 04:16:20,540
I keep...

5691
04:16:23,280 --> 04:16:28,620
I keep using the shift thinking it's my jump, but it's not.

5692
04:16:28,780 --> 04:16:29,980
No, Gengar!

5693
04:16:37,450 --> 04:16:38,530
Oh god.

5694
04:16:38,710 --> 04:16:39,010
Okay.

5695
04:16:41,750 --> 04:16:43,190
How do I grip?

5696
04:16:45,810 --> 04:16:47,730
If you don't look at me!

5697
04:16:52,880 --> 04:16:53,720
Oh shit.

5698
04:16:55,800 --> 04:16:56,400
Hello.

5699
04:16:56,460 --> 04:16:56,720
Goodbye.

5700
04:16:58,300 --> 04:16:58,900
Goodbye.

5701
04:17:05,620 --> 04:17:06,500
Get in!

5702
04:17:06,760 --> 04:17:07,860
It's tree time!

5703
04:17:10,360 --> 04:17:11,040
Tree!

5704
04:17:11,240 --> 04:17:11,780
Tree!

5705
04:17:11,780 --> 04:17:12,380
Tree!

5706
04:17:13,760 --> 04:17:15,880
Now I'm that life weaver.

5707
04:17:17,380 --> 04:17:18,940
Now I'm that life weaver.

5708
04:17:18,960 --> 04:17:19,420
There we go.

5709
04:17:20,220 --> 04:17:22,700
There we go.

5710
04:17:22,880 --> 04:17:23,320
It's fine.

5711
04:17:23,580 --> 04:17:24,700
I treed.

5712
04:17:27,560 --> 04:17:29,460
Oh god, Genji, please.

5713
04:17:29,740 --> 04:17:30,160
Oh god, Genji, please.

5714
04:17:30,160 --> 04:17:30,860
Not again.

5715
04:17:31,500 --> 04:17:32,520
Genji, please.

5716
04:17:33,700 --> 04:17:37,460
I don't know how to grip if you're all the way there.

5717
04:17:39,380 --> 04:17:40,520
Oh, thanks for the...

5718
04:17:40,520 --> 04:17:42,640
I really appreciate that.

5719
04:17:44,240 --> 04:17:45,100
Oh no.

5720
04:17:45,820 --> 04:17:48,900
Wait, I gave myself that.

5721
04:17:49,000 --> 04:17:50,700
Oh, I thought that was the enemy life weaver.

5722
04:17:50,860 --> 04:17:51,760
When did the fuck...

5723
04:17:51,760 --> 04:17:54,280
When did I threw the petal?

5724
04:17:55,000 --> 04:17:57,240
I was like, whoa, thanks life weaver.

5725
04:17:57,680 --> 04:17:59,020
I'm the life weaver.

5726
04:18:01,940 --> 04:18:03,700
I literally thought...

5727
04:18:04,840 --> 04:18:06,320
I thought the enemy...

5728
04:18:06,320 --> 04:18:08,360
I was like, where did that petal came from?

5729
04:18:09,240 --> 04:18:11,820
I don't know, but I was so surprised.

5730
04:18:12,260 --> 04:18:16,220
I was legitimately like, huh, where did that petal come from?

5731
04:18:23,530 --> 04:18:24,470
Oh shit.

5732
04:18:25,210 --> 04:18:26,370
It's orbit time.

5733
04:18:30,170 --> 04:18:30,790
What?

5734
04:18:33,530 --> 04:18:34,150
Please.

5735
04:18:34,410 --> 04:18:36,470
Please, somebody shoot me.

5736
04:18:37,730 --> 04:18:38,350
Please.

5737
04:18:38,390 --> 04:18:38,910
Please.

5738
04:18:41,350 --> 04:18:42,830
Where are the shots?

5739
04:18:46,010 --> 04:18:48,210
Yes, a medal to me.

5740
04:18:52,770 --> 04:18:54,090
Get gripped.

5741
04:18:54,430 --> 04:18:55,610
Oh, wrong grip.

5742
04:18:57,010 --> 04:18:58,550
Oh, he has...

5743
04:19:01,070 --> 04:19:02,170
Oh shit.

5744
04:19:02,730 --> 04:19:04,170
Oh shit, please.

5745
04:19:04,550 --> 04:19:05,210
Please.

5746
04:19:06,230 --> 04:19:06,890
Please.

5747
04:19:07,390 --> 04:19:08,970
Get me out of here.

5748
04:19:10,470 --> 04:19:11,290
Get me out of here.

5749
04:19:12,190 --> 04:19:13,950
I swear to god.

5750
04:19:14,410 --> 04:19:16,250
Holy fuck.

5751
04:19:16,530 --> 04:19:18,470
There was no fucking...

5752
04:19:19,230 --> 04:19:20,310
There was...

5753
04:19:20,310 --> 04:19:21,950
Oh, I see nine.

5754
04:19:26,310 --> 04:19:35,050
Oh my god.

5755
04:19:36,010 --> 04:19:39,170
Maybe I'm just really good at life weaver as well.

5756
04:19:40,470 --> 04:19:40,950
That's it.

5757
04:19:41,750 --> 04:19:43,590
Maybe I'm just...

5758
04:19:44,130 --> 04:19:45,410
Wait, let's do one more.

5759
04:19:51,030 --> 04:19:52,070
Let's do...

5760
04:19:54,130 --> 04:20:00,090
We might... guys, guys, we might be able... guys, we might be able to get to masters, guys.

5761
04:20:00,450 --> 04:20:01,250
That's me.

5762
04:20:02,510 --> 04:20:04,830
Maybe I could get to masters, guys.

5763
04:20:10,470 --> 04:20:11,490
Heh, heh, heh.

5764
04:20:13,070 --> 04:20:14,190
Guys, guys.

5765
04:20:14,490 --> 04:20:14,670
Guys, guys.

5766
04:20:14,670 --> 04:20:15,010
I'm okay.

5767
04:20:16,650 --> 04:20:17,270
Hehehehehe.

5768
04:20:21,240 --> 04:20:22,480
Heh, heh, heh, heh.

5769
04:20:24,080 --> 04:20:25,780
Heh, heh, heh.

5770
04:20:29,280 --> 04:20:31,040
For real, for real.

5771
04:20:31,400 --> 04:20:31,700
Heh, heh, heh.

5772
04:20:31,700 --> 04:20:33,400
Heh, heh, heh.

5773
04:20:34,000 --> 04:20:39,180
I could technically get to masters in 2 or 3 games.

5774
04:20:41,720 --> 04:20:45,460
In two to three games, I can technically get to Masters.

5775
04:20:46,520 --> 04:20:49,020
If I just win two to three games straight.

5776
04:20:52,080 --> 04:20:52,640
No,

5777
04:21:04,600 --> 04:21:04,780
no.

5778
04:21:07,160 --> 04:21:08,100
It'll be different.

5779
04:21:08,100 --> 04:21:11,000
Guys, it'll be so different.

5780
04:21:14,760 --> 04:21:16,080
You don't understand.

5781
04:21:21,760 --> 04:21:26,600
We found out what was the... We found out the key.

5782
04:21:29,420 --> 04:21:30,620
We found the key.

5783
04:21:30,840 --> 04:21:31,980
Anta, thank you for the super chat.

5784
04:21:32,040 --> 04:21:32,840
Thank you, thank you.

5785
04:21:32,920 --> 04:21:34,000
There's no red flags.

5786
04:21:34,360 --> 04:21:35,980
It's all green flags, guys.

5787
04:21:40,300 --> 04:21:41,900
You don't understand.

5788
04:21:42,400 --> 04:21:44,000
Overwatch was right about you guys.

5789
04:21:49,860 --> 04:21:52,180
I wish there were no green flags.

5790
04:21:55,400 --> 04:21:56,740
Toki, please.

5791
04:21:57,800 --> 04:22:00,060
I can't find a green flag.

5792
04:22:00,260 --> 04:22:01,900
So have some lettuce.

5793
04:22:02,900 --> 04:22:06,620
I can't find a green flag.

5794
04:22:06,680 --> 04:22:06,720
So have some lettuce.

5795
04:22:06,720 --> 04:22:08,080
Excuse me.

5796
04:22:08,080 --> 04:22:08,280
Me?

5797
04:22:11,480 --> 04:22:14,840
You told me you guys were trying to take me away from Overwatch.

5798
04:22:17,560 --> 04:22:20,220
Green flags and Toki is colorblind.

5799
04:22:20,480 --> 04:22:21,100
No name.

5800
04:22:21,180 --> 04:22:22,000
Thank you for the super chat.

5801
04:22:22,080 --> 04:22:23,080
Thank you, thank you.

5802
04:22:25,100 --> 04:22:25,740
It's okay.

5803
04:22:26,300 --> 04:22:27,360
Everything will be fine.

5804
04:22:28,320 --> 04:22:29,600
Everything will be fine.

5805
04:22:29,780 --> 04:22:31,020
We'll stop when we lose.

5806
04:22:32,700 --> 04:22:33,180
Chat.

5807
04:22:33,780 --> 04:22:35,400
We're gonna stop when we lose.

5808
04:22:42,360 --> 04:22:43,940
Alright, suit yourself.

5809
04:22:48,260 --> 04:22:50,460
Guys, we're gonna stop when we lose, guys.

5810
04:22:51,200 --> 04:22:54,960
Guys, we'll stop when we lose, guys.

5811
04:22:56,720 --> 04:22:59,740
And if we keep winning, well, we just keep winning.

5812
04:23:01,560 --> 04:23:02,660
Toki, it's not too late.

5813
04:23:02,720 --> 04:23:04,680
Just say the word and we'll get you out of here.

5814
04:23:04,840 --> 04:23:05,860
Tia, thank you for the super chat.

5815
04:23:05,940 --> 04:23:06,420
Thank you, thank you.

5816
04:23:06,420 --> 04:23:07,000
Get me out of what?

5817
04:23:07,640 --> 04:23:10,600
I'm in a very loving relationship with Overwatch.

5818
04:23:11,120 --> 04:23:12,220
Get me out of what?

5819
04:23:12,860 --> 04:23:14,280
He's changed, guys.

5820
04:23:14,600 --> 04:23:15,140
You don't understand.

5821
04:23:15,640 --> 04:23:16,500
We've been winning.

5822
04:23:17,820 --> 04:23:19,840
Like, yeah, it was rough at the beginning.

5823
04:23:20,460 --> 04:23:23,020
But like, it got better.

5824
04:23:23,710 --> 04:23:24,460
It got better.

5825
04:23:24,700 --> 04:23:25,720
It got so much better.

5826
04:23:26,200 --> 04:23:27,760
It got so...

5827
04:23:27,760 --> 04:23:33,660
I love Overwatch.

5828
04:23:35,120 --> 04:23:36,720
We lost.

5829
04:23:37,880 --> 04:23:41,000
Guys, I...

5830
04:23:41,600 --> 04:23:43,720
Guys, I love Overwatch.

5831
04:23:49,760 --> 04:23:50,980
Oh my god.

5832
04:23:56,480 --> 04:23:58,040
I can't believe it, though.

5833
04:23:58,620 --> 04:24:01,900
Ever since I went crazy with the Juno strat.

5834
04:24:02,660 --> 04:24:04,140
Things are looking up.

5835
04:24:04,480 --> 04:24:08,600
Things really are looking up for me.

5836
04:24:10,980 --> 04:24:12,960
They always say that, but they're not.

5837
04:24:13,120 --> 04:24:13,860
No, it's fine.

5838
04:24:14,140 --> 04:24:15,540
Guys, it's fine.

5839
04:24:16,120 --> 04:24:17,240
Everything is fine.

5840
04:24:18,980 --> 04:24:21,020
The keyword is crazy.

5841
04:24:21,020 --> 04:24:21,400
Crazy.

5842
04:24:29,020 --> 04:24:29,660
Okay.

5843
04:24:30,740 --> 04:24:31,860
Alright, we're gonna auto-lock.

5844
04:24:32,240 --> 04:24:33,440
We're gonna auto-lock.

5845
04:24:33,740 --> 04:24:35,300
Guys, I figured it out.

5846
04:24:35,620 --> 04:24:36,780
I just...

5847
04:24:36,780 --> 04:24:38,760
All I have to do...

5848
04:24:40,140 --> 04:24:40,780
Is...

5849
04:24:40,780 --> 04:24:42,940
All we need to do...

5850
04:24:44,400 --> 04:24:45,680
Is basically...

5851
04:24:45,680 --> 04:24:48,460
We play either Life Weaver...

5852
04:24:49,460 --> 04:24:50,500
Life Weaver...

5853
04:24:50,500 --> 04:24:52,840
Or Juno.

5854
04:24:52,980 --> 04:24:55,380
If we can't get Juno, we get Life Weaver.

5855
04:24:55,640 --> 04:24:56,340
Are you...

5856
04:24:56,340 --> 04:24:56,680
Okay.

5857
04:24:56,880 --> 04:24:57,560
We start...

5858
04:24:57,560 --> 04:24:58,780
This might be...

5859
04:24:59,820 --> 04:25:01,600
I feel like this is a sign.

5860
04:25:02,320 --> 04:25:03,340
If that's...

5861
04:25:04,100 --> 04:25:06,840
There's a Rein and a D.Va running around.

5862
04:25:07,020 --> 04:25:09,660
I feel like this is a sign of...

5863
04:25:09,660 --> 04:25:12,660
This is a sign of...

5864
04:25:14,940 --> 04:25:16,500
Or like what this game...

5865
04:25:16,500 --> 04:25:17,100
Oh, thank god.

5866
04:25:18,460 --> 04:25:19,660
Thank god.

5867
04:25:26,780 --> 04:25:29,380
Oh, thank god.

5868
04:25:29,720 --> 04:25:31,760
It's not over yet.

5869
04:25:36,000 --> 04:25:38,140
It's not over yet, guys!

5870
04:25:45,120 --> 04:25:46,240
Alright.

5871
04:25:48,040 --> 04:25:48,980
This is it.

5872
04:25:52,520 --> 04:25:54,020
God, I love Overwatch.

5873
04:25:57,940 --> 04:26:02,180
I hope Overwatch is on for 10 more years.

5874
04:26:03,700 --> 04:26:06,380
Please Dokia, I want to sleep.

5875
04:26:09,320 --> 04:26:16,320
Alright, here we go.

5876
04:26:17,130 --> 04:26:20,380
Also, after replacing, I'm not going to play until like...

5877
04:26:20,920 --> 04:26:22,820
until like a week or two later.

5878
04:26:23,340 --> 04:26:25,260
So then everything will be stabilized.

5879
04:26:25,640 --> 04:26:26,720
Oh, I forgot to do this.

5880
04:26:38,170 --> 04:26:40,190
Oh my god, I forgot I played Juno.

5881
04:26:40,390 --> 04:26:41,870
It only took one game.

5882
04:26:45,330 --> 04:26:49,170
It only took one game.

5883
04:26:59,450 --> 04:27:00,490
It's fine.

5884
04:27:00,610 --> 04:27:01,150
We're fine.

5885
04:27:03,250 --> 04:27:04,190
Everything's fine.

5886
04:27:04,410 --> 04:27:06,410
Everything is fine.

5887
04:27:06,670 --> 04:27:11,470
Okay, it's only because I haven't touched on...

5888
04:27:11,470 --> 04:27:16,870
I still haven't built the muscle memory for Juno yet.

5889
04:27:17,050 --> 04:27:20,850
Guys, I haven't built the muscle memory.

5890
04:27:21,250 --> 04:27:27,610
So the fact that I have to go back to Juno afterwards...

5891
04:27:28,470 --> 04:27:29,510
It's understandable.

5892
04:27:35,060 --> 04:27:36,360
It's understandable!

5893
04:27:41,320 --> 04:27:42,320
Oh god.

5894
04:27:43,880 --> 04:27:44,680
Alright.

5895
04:27:45,380 --> 04:27:47,220
I should be able to push in, right?

5896
04:27:47,600 --> 04:27:48,400
Woah.

5897
04:27:48,940 --> 04:27:49,740
Okay.

5898
04:27:51,920 --> 04:27:52,720
Okay.

5899
04:27:54,000 --> 04:27:54,800
Okay.

5900
04:28:03,140 --> 04:28:03,940
Woah!

5901
04:28:04,160 --> 04:28:05,600
Alright, we're staggered now.

5902
04:28:05,840 --> 04:28:08,080
We're... we're staggered.

5903
04:28:11,840 --> 04:28:12,800
Oh shit.

5904
04:28:13,140 --> 04:28:14,520
Hey, the Reaper is okay.

5905
04:28:14,740 --> 04:28:16,180
Oh, we're hella staggered now.

5906
04:28:16,440 --> 04:28:17,080
Oh, we are.

5907
04:28:17,620 --> 04:28:19,200
We are so staggered.

5908
04:28:19,240 --> 04:28:20,480
Don't worry, I got you.

5909
04:28:21,600 --> 04:28:23,160
Okay, we have the orbital.

5910
04:28:23,920 --> 04:28:25,960
Alright guys, I don't think Juno is the pick.

5911
04:28:26,300 --> 04:28:30,040
I think it's time to do plan...

5912
04:28:30,040 --> 04:28:32,400
the second plan of...

5913
04:28:32,400 --> 04:28:33,640
What the fuck?

5914
04:28:34,800 --> 04:28:35,720
Oh my god.

5915
04:28:42,210 --> 04:28:42,690
Alright.

5916
04:28:49,880 --> 04:28:50,620
Please!

5917
04:28:50,980 --> 04:28:52,500
I was healing you!

5918
04:28:55,860 --> 04:28:56,600
Please!

5919
04:28:57,220 --> 04:28:59,500
I healed you so much!

5920
04:28:59,680 --> 04:29:00,920
Alright, Kiriko tap.

5921
04:29:04,020 --> 04:29:05,460
It's Kiriko tap.

5922
04:29:08,340 --> 04:29:10,980
I healed you so much.

5923
04:29:12,970 --> 04:29:15,680
Alright, it's time for the second plan.

5924
04:29:16,340 --> 04:29:17,080
Hahaha.

5925
04:29:17,080 --> 04:29:18,380
Bring it in.

5926
04:29:19,880 --> 04:29:20,740
What's that?

5927
04:29:21,180 --> 04:29:22,420
What the fuck?

5928
04:29:28,250 --> 04:29:28,970
Ohgah.

5929
04:29:31,670 --> 04:29:33,210
Oh, that's unlucky.

5930
04:29:33,830 --> 04:29:36,610
Guys, I think this is the last game now.

5931
04:29:36,990 --> 04:29:37,710
Guys.

5932
04:29:44,710 --> 04:29:46,570
I don't understand.

5933
04:29:47,590 --> 04:29:49,490
It's always been working.

5934
04:29:50,010 --> 04:29:50,730
It's always been working.

5935
04:29:50,730 --> 04:29:51,990
WHAT HAPPENED?!

5936
04:29:55,190 --> 04:29:57,430
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE STRAIGHT?!

5937
04:29:59,950 --> 04:30:01,130
I don't understand.

5938
04:30:03,890 --> 04:30:05,490
He definitely has shatter, by the way.

5939
04:30:05,590 --> 04:30:07,370
He 100% has shatter.

5940
04:30:07,550 --> 04:30:09,750
There's no fucking way he does not have shatter.

5941
04:30:10,670 --> 04:30:11,410
Wait, what?

5942
04:30:11,490 --> 04:30:11,670
Why?

5943
04:30:12,710 --> 04:30:13,250
Okay.

5944
04:30:13,930 --> 04:30:15,070
Um, okay.

5945
04:30:16,710 --> 04:30:17,650
I'm gonna cap.

5946
04:30:24,070 --> 04:30:25,370
This is it.

5947
04:30:29,870 --> 04:30:30,550
Yippee!

5948
04:30:30,550 --> 04:30:31,230
Yippee!

5949
04:30:32,130 --> 04:30:32,810
Yippee!

5950
04:30:33,790 --> 04:30:35,230
Everything will be fine!

5951
04:30:36,310 --> 04:30:38,630
It's just like two to three, guys.

5952
04:30:38,870 --> 04:30:40,050
It's winnable.

5953
04:30:41,570 --> 04:30:42,690
It's winnable.

5954
04:30:44,730 --> 04:30:45,410
Whoa!

5955
04:30:50,570 --> 04:30:51,950
Wait, where is that?

5956
04:30:54,990 --> 04:30:56,010
Alright.

5957
04:30:56,050 --> 04:30:57,390
I saved him.

5958
04:30:59,130 --> 04:31:01,990
Oh my god!

5959
04:31:02,290 --> 04:31:03,930
He is...yep.

5960
04:31:05,530 --> 04:31:06,890
Not saved.

5961
04:31:08,030 --> 04:31:09,330
Is this winnable still?

5962
04:31:17,020 --> 04:31:18,040
Alright.

5963
04:31:22,770 --> 04:31:23,280
Alright.

5964
04:31:24,770 --> 04:31:25,280
Alright.

5965
04:31:26,890 --> 04:31:27,400
Oh...

5966
04:31:28,280 --> 04:31:30,020
That poor man.

5967
04:31:33,570 --> 04:31:36,550
I'm trying my best to keep you alive, bro.

5968
04:31:36,990 --> 04:31:37,710
No!

5969
04:31:38,090 --> 04:31:39,550
He saw me!

5970
04:31:40,410 --> 04:31:41,990
Oh my god!

5971
04:31:42,010 --> 04:31:42,990
He saw me!

5972
04:31:44,990 --> 04:31:47,390
I thought he did not exist!

5973
04:31:47,830 --> 04:31:53,610
I think your DPS is better than our DPS.

5974
04:31:57,590 --> 04:31:58,150
Woo!

5975
04:31:58,530 --> 04:32:00,410
Guys, are you...you guys are...okay.

5976
04:32:00,590 --> 04:32:01,110
It's fine.

5977
04:32:01,350 --> 04:32:02,650
We don't need that point, guys.

5978
04:32:03,690 --> 04:32:04,970
This...it'll be different.

5979
04:32:05,250 --> 04:32:07,090
Oh my god.

5980
04:32:07,270 --> 04:32:08,430
It'll be different here!

5981
04:32:09,790 --> 04:32:10,350
See?

5982
04:32:10,530 --> 04:32:11,330
We got a pig!

5983
04:32:11,570 --> 04:32:12,970
It'll be so different!

5984
04:32:15,090 --> 04:32:15,650
Okay...

5985
04:32:15,650 --> 04:32:16,490
Hehehe!

5986
04:32:20,030 --> 04:32:23,490
Oh, we are trying so hard to keep you alive.

5987
04:32:23,490 --> 04:32:23,590
Oh, my gosh!

5988
04:32:25,710 --> 04:32:26,450
Oh, no.

5989
04:32:27,410 --> 04:32:28,350
Oh, no!

5990
04:32:28,990 --> 04:32:29,530
Oh, no!

5991
04:32:29,530 --> 04:32:30,030
Oh, my gosh!

5992
04:32:32,150 --> 04:32:33,690
Oh, no!

5993
04:32:33,850 --> 04:32:34,010
Oh, no!

5994
04:32:34,010 --> 04:32:34,210
Oh, no!

5995
04:32:34,210 --> 04:32:34,290
Oh, no!

5996
04:32:38,880 --> 04:32:39,420
Okay...

5997
04:32:40,940 --> 04:32:43,000
This Kenji definitely has a...

5998
04:32:46,200 --> 04:32:47,000
That's fine!

5999
04:32:47,240 --> 04:32:48,000
That's fine!

6000
04:32:48,280 --> 04:32:50,240
We can grab it and get it back!

6001
04:32:50,940 --> 04:32:51,480
Haha!

6002
04:32:51,480 --> 04:32:53,660
We can get it back.

6003
04:32:56,520 --> 04:32:58,760
Overwatch wouldn't do this to me.

6004
04:33:01,360 --> 04:33:02,440
He has shatter.

6005
04:33:02,660 --> 04:33:03,880
He has shatter.

6006
04:33:05,820 --> 04:33:06,340
Guys,

6007
04:33:15,300 --> 04:33:15,700
go in!

6008
04:33:15,780 --> 04:33:16,440
Go in, please!

6009
04:33:18,140 --> 04:33:19,180
Please go in!

6010
04:33:19,680 --> 04:33:21,020
Go into the point!

6011
04:33:22,320 --> 04:33:24,360
Go into the point!

6012
04:33:24,620 --> 04:33:26,600
We don't have to care about him!

6013
04:33:26,740 --> 04:33:29,100
Why didn't we go to the point?

6014
04:33:31,060 --> 04:33:31,700
Okay.

6015
04:33:31,960 --> 04:33:32,880
That's fine.

6016
04:33:33,360 --> 04:33:34,080
That's fine.

6017
04:33:34,240 --> 04:33:35,580
The ride's coming back.

6018
04:33:35,680 --> 04:33:36,160
That's okay.

6019
04:33:37,980 --> 04:33:39,560
Guys, I think I hit Clash.

6020
04:33:39,860 --> 04:33:42,100
I think I still hit Clash.

6021
04:33:45,460 --> 04:33:46,160
Oh god.

6022
04:33:53,710 --> 04:33:54,750
Oh god.

6023
04:33:55,010 --> 04:33:56,150
Oh yeah.

6024
04:33:57,890 --> 04:33:59,250
Oh, it's over.

6025
04:33:59,870 --> 04:34:00,990
It's over.

6026
04:34:05,690 --> 04:34:07,470
I don't understand.

6027
04:34:07,910 --> 04:34:10,230
How did the strat stop working?

6028
04:34:10,750 --> 04:34:12,290
I don't understand.

6029
04:34:17,030 --> 04:34:18,970
How did you die so fast?

6030
04:34:19,070 --> 04:34:19,810
You had nano!

6031
04:34:26,530 --> 04:34:27,850
Holy shit.

6032
04:34:32,350 --> 04:34:33,010
Guys.

6033
04:34:33,370 --> 04:34:33,630
Guys.

6034
04:34:34,110 --> 04:34:34,770
Guys.

6035
04:34:35,130 --> 04:34:36,670
I should have played Life Weaver.

6036
04:34:36,930 --> 04:34:39,770
I forgot the second part.

6037
04:34:40,410 --> 04:34:45,050
Just an unlucky game?

6038
04:34:45,270 --> 04:34:46,110
You're right.

6039
04:34:46,190 --> 04:34:47,270
I should go next.

6040
04:34:47,590 --> 04:34:48,150
Okay.

6041
04:34:48,310 --> 04:34:49,350
But, like, you're...

6042
04:34:49,350 --> 04:34:49,790
Guys.

6043
04:34:50,170 --> 04:34:50,830
Guys.

6044
04:34:50,990 --> 04:34:51,790
You're right.

6045
04:34:51,790 --> 04:34:53,070
It was just unlucky.

6046
04:34:53,390 --> 04:34:54,670
The next game...

6047
04:34:54,670 --> 04:34:55,610
It'll be different.

6048
04:34:55,890 --> 04:34:57,590
We can't end it on a loss.

6049
04:34:57,910 --> 04:34:58,430
Chat?

6050
04:34:59,050 --> 04:34:59,690
Chat!

6051
04:34:59,870 --> 04:35:01,310
We can't end it on a loss!

6052
04:35:02,030 --> 04:35:02,670
Guys.

6053
04:35:02,870 --> 04:35:03,410
We...

6054
04:35:05,450 --> 04:35:06,550
Don't you know?

6055
04:35:07,570 --> 04:35:09,550
If you end on a loss...

6056
04:35:09,550 --> 04:35:10,610
Then, like...

6057
04:35:10,610 --> 04:35:13,650
Then, like, why would I want to be sad with losing?

6058
04:35:14,250 --> 04:35:15,150
It's true!

6059
04:35:16,570 --> 04:35:16,890
Guys.

6060
04:35:17,990 --> 04:35:19,130
It's true!

6061
04:35:20,510 --> 04:35:21,150
Just...

6062
04:35:21,150 --> 04:35:22,690
Just think about it this way!

6063
04:35:24,030 --> 04:35:24,590
Just...

6064
04:35:27,250 --> 04:35:29,190
We gotta end on a win!

6065
04:35:30,850 --> 04:35:31,770
We gotta...

6066
04:35:31,770 --> 04:35:33,490
We gotta end on a win!

6067
04:35:36,790 --> 04:35:38,470
Just think about it!

6068
04:35:41,390 --> 04:35:41,950
Guys!

6069
04:35:43,350 --> 04:35:43,910
Okay.

6070
04:35:43,990 --> 04:35:44,510
Give me a sec.

6071
04:35:44,570 --> 04:35:44,930
Let me...

6072
04:35:44,930 --> 04:35:46,650
Put something on real fast.

6073
04:35:47,030 --> 04:35:47,970
Let me...

6074
04:35:51,150 --> 04:35:54,830
If you're gonna be this loser...

6075
04:35:57,930 --> 04:36:02,390
What are you talking about?

6076
04:36:03,030 --> 04:36:05,130
I don't know what you're talking about!

6077
04:36:07,000 --> 04:36:08,190
What do you mean?

6078
04:36:08,890 --> 04:36:09,590
Talulu?

6079
04:36:10,450 --> 04:36:11,650
I'm not Talulu!

6080
04:36:15,630 --> 04:36:18,950
What do you mean, Talulu?

6081
04:36:18,950 --> 04:36:19,230
Talulu!

6082
04:36:22,870 --> 04:36:25,090
What do you mean?

6083
04:36:30,070 --> 04:36:32,190
I'm perfectly fine...

6084
04:36:32,950 --> 04:36:33,470
Guys.

6085
04:36:35,850 --> 04:36:37,430
Guys, I'm perfectly fine.

6086
04:36:38,230 --> 04:36:40,350
I don't know what you're talking about.

6087
04:36:42,090 --> 04:36:43,270
I'm okay.

6088
04:36:45,030 --> 04:36:46,230
I'm okay...

6089
04:36:47,310 --> 04:36:48,670
I'm okay...

6090
04:36:48,670 --> 04:36:48,930
I'm okay...

6091
04:36:48,930 --> 04:36:50,150
I love Overwatch.

6092
04:36:50,590 --> 04:36:52,650
I love Overwatch.

6093
04:36:53,390 --> 04:36:57,050
Overwatch has always been so nice to me.

6094
04:37:01,350 --> 04:37:04,150
I love Overwatch.

6095
04:37:05,030 --> 04:37:06,650
I love...

6096
04:37:06,650 --> 04:37:09,070
I love Overwatch.

6097
04:37:20,670 --> 04:37:23,010
Overwatch will never hurt me.

6098
04:37:23,570 --> 04:37:25,990
Don't keep this as an intervention.

6099
04:37:26,650 --> 04:37:28,310
Thank you for the super chat.

6100
04:37:28,510 --> 04:37:30,010
Thank you, Alan.

6101
04:37:30,430 --> 04:37:31,610
What intervention?

6102
04:37:32,710 --> 04:37:33,110
Why?

6103
04:37:34,470 --> 04:37:37,150
Overwatch has always been there for me.

6104
04:37:37,810 --> 04:37:39,930
Where have you guys been?

6105
04:37:43,390 --> 04:37:46,610
Where were you guys six years ago?

6106
04:37:47,450 --> 04:37:48,910
Overwatch was so nice to me.

6107
04:37:48,930 --> 04:37:50,910
It was there for me six years ago.

6108
04:37:58,470 --> 04:37:59,510
Alright, don't worry.

6109
04:37:59,610 --> 04:38:01,830
This is last game chat for real.

6110
04:38:02,730 --> 04:38:03,490
For real.

6111
04:38:03,630 --> 04:38:05,010
What do you mean?

6112
04:38:06,370 --> 04:38:14,670
If your loved ones have been affected by Overwatch 2, lend them an ear and a shoulder to lean on if they need it.

6113
04:38:15,530 --> 04:38:16,170
It's okay.

6114
04:38:16,750 --> 04:38:17,490
It's okay.

6115
04:38:17,590 --> 04:38:18,450
We can do this.

6116
04:38:18,930 --> 04:38:21,070
Guys, we can do this.

6117
04:38:21,870 --> 04:38:22,750
I believe.

6118
04:38:22,870 --> 04:38:23,650
This is it.

6119
04:38:24,190 --> 04:38:25,630
We're gonna win here.

6120
04:38:26,190 --> 04:38:28,030
We're gonna win here and then...

6121
04:38:28,830 --> 04:38:29,590
And then...

6122
04:38:29,590 --> 04:38:32,350
After that, we're gonna win.

6123
04:38:35,090 --> 04:38:35,650
Okay.

6124
04:38:36,730 --> 04:38:37,710
Give me a sec.

6125
04:38:37,890 --> 04:38:39,030
I need like...

6126
04:38:39,830 --> 04:38:40,830
Give me a sec.

6127
04:38:40,890 --> 04:38:41,310
Let me...

6128
04:38:44,000 --> 04:38:45,680
Let me get rid of...

6129
04:38:49,340 --> 04:38:50,500
We'll be fine.

6130
04:38:51,460 --> 04:38:53,700
We'll be... We'll be so fine.

6131
04:38:54,800 --> 04:38:55,560
Guys...

6132
04:38:55,560 --> 04:38:57,220
We'll be so fine.

6133
04:39:01,280 --> 04:39:02,700
We'll be okay.

6134
04:39:08,180 --> 04:39:09,360
We'll be...

6135
04:39:13,470 --> 04:39:15,670
We're attacked so I don't have to worry.

6136
04:39:17,590 --> 04:39:18,470
We're attacked so I don't have to worry.

6137
04:39:18,470 --> 04:39:19,970
That's the wrong way.

6138
04:39:20,050 --> 04:39:20,390
Oops.

6139
04:39:21,730 --> 04:39:23,030
That's the wrong way.

6140
04:39:23,470 --> 04:39:25,630
Oh, there it is.

6141
04:39:28,390 --> 04:39:29,990
It was too busy.

6142
04:39:36,990 --> 04:39:38,810
I lost the instant.

6143
04:39:40,830 --> 04:39:42,250
We'll be okay.

6144
04:39:45,370 --> 04:39:46,670
We'll be okay.

6145
04:39:47,110 --> 04:39:47,150
Let's go team.

6146
04:39:50,270 --> 04:39:51,510
I'm gonna try to move my fight.

6147
04:39:51,710 --> 04:39:52,030
I'm gonna try to move my fight.

6148
04:39:52,030 --> 04:39:52,970
Oh shit, you're right.

6149
04:39:53,070 --> 04:39:53,590
Life Weaver.

6150
04:39:56,910 --> 04:39:57,390
Okay.

6151
04:40:00,470 --> 04:40:01,430
Oh shit.

6152
04:40:01,510 --> 04:40:01,770
Oh shit.

6153
04:40:01,770 --> 04:40:01,870
Nice.

6154
04:40:04,570 --> 04:40:05,230
That's good.

6155
04:40:05,590 --> 04:40:05,670
That's good.

6156
04:40:06,230 --> 04:40:07,570
What is this Mercy doing?

6157
04:40:08,090 --> 04:40:08,550
Okay.

6158
04:40:15,860 --> 04:40:17,180
There's a Reaper right here.

6159
04:40:17,420 --> 04:40:17,460
There's a Reaper right here.

6160
04:40:19,500 --> 04:40:20,820
There's a Reaper right...

6161
04:40:20,820 --> 04:40:21,780
Wait, I can pick Juno!

6162
04:40:24,500 --> 04:40:25,880
Guys, I can pick Juno, guys.

6163
04:40:26,580 --> 04:40:28,600
Guys, you know what our Hammond needs?

6164
04:40:28,780 --> 04:40:29,180
Juno.

6165
04:40:30,860 --> 04:40:31,760
Alright, good job.

6166
04:40:33,140 --> 04:40:34,600
That's what our Hammond needs.

6167
04:40:35,240 --> 04:40:36,100
Pick up the red.

6168
04:40:38,800 --> 04:40:40,440
That's exactly what he needs.

6169
04:40:45,660 --> 04:40:46,180
Careful.

6170
04:40:46,180 --> 04:40:46,560
Careful.

6171
04:40:49,760 --> 04:40:51,080
Jesus Christ.

6172
04:40:51,700 --> 04:40:52,120
Oh.

6173
04:40:55,760 --> 04:40:56,920
What the fuck?

6174
04:40:57,460 --> 04:41:00,020
What the fuck is he doing?

6175
04:41:02,140 --> 04:41:03,900
Holy shit.

6176
04:41:04,600 --> 04:41:05,480
Holy shit.

6177
04:41:05,480 --> 04:41:05,920
Oh shit.

6178
04:41:09,180 --> 04:41:10,740
Guys, I told you.

6179
04:41:10,820 --> 04:41:13,040
I told you Overwatch will never...

6180
04:41:13,040 --> 04:41:15,040
will never disappoint me.

6181
04:41:15,400 --> 04:41:16,300
Oh no no.

6182
04:41:17,860 --> 04:41:19,000
Oh no.

6183
04:41:19,400 --> 04:41:20,100
I got Sombra now.

6184
04:41:20,220 --> 04:41:21,060
Wait, that's not fair.

6185
04:41:21,140 --> 04:41:22,480
You're not supposed to counterswap.

6186
04:41:23,520 --> 04:41:24,760
That is illegal.

6187
04:41:27,960 --> 04:41:29,640
Counterswap in my Overwatch game?

6188
04:41:31,080 --> 04:41:33,160
You're supposed to one trick one hero.

6189
04:41:33,200 --> 04:41:33,760
And that's it.

6190
04:41:37,730 --> 04:41:38,890
Keep pushing the payload.

6191
04:41:39,710 --> 04:41:40,030
Nice.

6192
04:41:40,390 --> 04:41:41,270
Jesus Christ.

6193
04:41:42,550 --> 04:41:43,050
Pardon.

6194
04:41:44,950 --> 04:41:45,450
Oh.

6195
04:41:46,650 --> 04:41:47,410
Oh, goodbye!

6196
04:41:48,810 --> 04:41:51,070
Yeah, Overwatch is there for me since the beginning.

6197
04:41:53,590 --> 04:41:56,890
Overwatch would never disappoint me if you said no one every.

6198
04:42:01,950 --> 04:42:05,770
right now Overwatch would never disappoint me in the next 10 minutes.

6199
04:42:10,600 --> 04:42:11,960
Oh shit.

6200
04:42:12,180 --> 04:42:13,640
What a piece of shit.

6201
04:42:15,400 --> 04:42:16,520
Get over here.

6202
04:42:20,560 --> 04:42:21,560
That's unlucky.

6203
04:42:21,940 --> 04:42:23,460
What the fuck?

6204
04:42:23,460 --> 04:42:24,340
I'm feeling deployed.

6205
04:42:26,260 --> 04:42:27,120
Monkey low.

6206
04:42:27,320 --> 04:42:28,900
Is monkey dead?

6207
04:42:31,960 --> 04:42:33,200
Woo, I did that.

6208
04:42:36,380 --> 04:42:37,900
Don't worry, I got you.

6209
04:42:40,000 --> 04:42:41,020
Oh, don't!

6210
04:42:41,020 --> 04:42:41,460
Okay.

6211
04:42:41,780 --> 04:42:42,780
That's awkward.

6212
04:42:45,940 --> 04:42:47,060
Oh my god.

6213
04:42:47,100 --> 04:42:48,060
Five minutes?

6214
04:42:48,900 --> 04:42:50,280
I told you!

6215
04:42:50,280 --> 04:42:50,920
Holy shit!

6216
04:42:50,920 --> 04:42:55,480
Oh my gosh, you'll never disappoint me!

6217
04:43:00,360 --> 04:43:02,420
We both panicked.

6218
04:43:02,500 --> 04:43:04,820
We both fucking panicked.

6219
04:43:04,840 --> 04:43:07,120
Me and the Zen both panicked there.

6220
04:43:07,160 --> 04:43:10,940
He panicked, I panicked, but it was the worst outcome.

6221
04:43:12,940 --> 04:43:15,220
Guys, we need to change!

6222
04:43:21,020 --> 04:43:21,700
Guys!

6223
04:43:31,480 --> 04:43:33,540
This was my job.

6224
04:43:35,320 --> 04:43:37,440
This is my job.

6225
04:43:41,680 --> 04:43:42,700
Hey, Miss.

6226
04:43:43,020 --> 04:43:43,160
Yay.

6227
04:43:44,200 --> 04:43:44,440
Good eye!

6228
04:43:44,540 --> 04:43:44,900
How about that?

6229
04:43:44,920 --> 04:43:46,500
Jump, jump, jump.

6230
04:43:47,960 --> 04:43:48,640
Jump!

6231
04:43:48,800 --> 04:43:49,220
Jump!

6232
04:43:49,680 --> 04:43:49,900
Jump!

6233
04:43:49,900 --> 04:43:50,220
Jump!

6234
04:43:53,120 --> 04:43:54,080
Oh game!

6235
04:43:54,320 --> 04:43:54,920
Jesus!

6236
04:43:58,200 --> 04:43:58,840
Alright.

6237
04:44:02,200 --> 04:44:03,440
Alright, here we go.

6238
04:44:06,000 --> 04:44:06,640
Alright,

6239
04:44:12,240 --> 04:44:12,700
this is it.

6240
04:44:14,420 --> 04:44:15,340
This is it.

6241
04:44:16,920 --> 04:44:18,940
Jump, jump, jump, jump!

6242
04:44:18,940 --> 04:44:19,200
Jump!

6243
04:44:25,530 --> 04:44:25,970
See?

6244
04:44:26,170 --> 04:44:27,030
I'm doing it.

6245
04:44:33,920 --> 04:44:34,600
What's he gonna do?

6246
04:44:34,640 --> 04:44:35,300
Jump at us?

6247
04:44:35,500 --> 04:44:36,800
Guys, I think he's gonna jump at us.

6248
04:44:38,560 --> 04:44:43,260
Guys, I think he wants to jump at us.

6249
04:44:48,360 --> 04:44:49,380
Don't worry Zenyatta!

6250
04:44:49,840 --> 04:44:51,540
I'll never let them do this to you!

6251
04:44:52,540 --> 04:44:53,180
Oh god.

6252
04:44:56,660 --> 04:44:58,400
I keep forgetting my E.

6253
04:45:03,370 --> 04:45:04,090
This is it.

6254
04:45:04,790 --> 04:45:06,050
I'm the Juno player.

6255
04:45:07,010 --> 04:45:09,330
Juno might be dogshit, but like, I'm her.

6256
04:45:10,730 --> 04:45:11,490
We can go.

6257
04:45:12,990 --> 04:45:15,150
I have no muscle memory for her yet though.

6258
04:45:15,250 --> 04:45:16,150
What the fuck?

6259
04:45:17,230 --> 04:45:18,410
What did he do?

6260
04:45:18,710 --> 04:45:19,810
Killed his ass in his spawn.

6261
04:45:22,570 --> 04:45:23,730
What the f- wait.

6262
04:45:25,550 --> 04:45:26,510
What the fuck?

6263
04:45:26,710 --> 04:45:27,530
Who's over here?

6264
04:45:27,650 --> 04:45:28,730
Yeah, who's the Mora?

6265
04:45:31,530 --> 04:45:31,970
Who's over here?

6266
04:45:31,970 --> 04:45:31,970
Yeah, who's the Mora?

6267
04:45:31,970 --> 04:45:33,710
What the fuck is going on?

6268
04:45:34,010 --> 04:45:36,150
Oh I can't jump high.

6269
04:45:36,710 --> 04:45:37,750
That's bullshit.

6270
04:45:38,830 --> 04:45:41,870
I'm like trying to figure out how high I can jump for this.

6271
04:45:44,550 --> 04:45:45,150
Okay.

6272
04:45:46,570 --> 04:45:47,470
Oh no!

6273
04:45:47,670 --> 04:45:48,250
No way.

6274
04:45:48,610 --> 04:45:49,190
Oh no.

6275
04:45:49,430 --> 04:45:50,630
This is bad.

6276
04:45:52,010 --> 04:45:53,670
This is bad now.

6277
04:45:54,670 --> 04:45:55,670
What do we do?

6278
04:45:56,890 --> 04:45:58,190
There's no TP highground.

6279
04:46:01,360 --> 04:46:02,260
Oh god.

6280
04:46:02,260 --> 04:46:03,740
We keep each other alive.

6281
04:46:06,300 --> 04:46:07,380
Don't worry, bro.

6282
04:46:08,420 --> 04:46:09,900
And we keep each other alive.

6283
04:46:14,020 --> 04:46:16,680
Oh shit, our Junkrat is really good.

6284
04:46:19,960 --> 04:46:20,980
We're so good.

6285
04:46:21,200 --> 04:46:21,920
We're so good.

6286
04:46:22,500 --> 04:46:24,260
This is a very goofy match.

6287
04:46:24,800 --> 04:46:27,320
We actually have a good Hammond player.

6288
04:46:28,580 --> 04:46:30,080
That's actually crazy.

6289
04:46:30,080 --> 04:46:32,380
We have a good Hammond.

6290
04:46:33,880 --> 04:46:36,060
Yeah, Stickman is really a Junkrat.

6291
04:46:40,160 --> 04:46:40,820
Alright.

6292
04:46:42,580 --> 04:46:43,440
It's fine.

6293
04:46:43,740 --> 04:46:45,260
Everything is a-okay.

6294
04:46:45,830 --> 04:46:47,100
Oh my god!

6295
04:46:47,180 --> 04:46:48,420
What the fuck?

6296
04:46:49,100 --> 04:46:51,060
Nobody took any damage!

6297
04:46:53,120 --> 04:46:54,820
Oh, spoke too soon.

6298
04:46:55,200 --> 04:46:57,020
Oh, spoke too soon.

6299
04:46:57,780 --> 04:46:59,360
Oh, whoa, whoa, fly!

6300
04:47:02,120 --> 04:47:02,700
Fly!

6301
04:47:02,960 --> 04:47:07,640
I do not wanna deal with that.

6302
04:47:09,980 --> 04:47:10,580
Okay.

6303
04:47:11,160 --> 04:47:12,320
It's fly time.

6304
04:47:12,540 --> 04:47:12,640
Ooh!

6305
04:47:13,740 --> 04:47:15,540
What if it goes inside corridors?

6306
04:47:17,680 --> 04:47:18,280
Okay.

6307
04:47:19,920 --> 04:47:27,640
Like, there's no reason to use my ult or like or like any of my abilities right now.

6308
04:47:28,140 --> 04:47:28,740
Phew!

6309
04:47:29,260 --> 04:47:29,860
Speed!

6310
04:47:30,680 --> 04:47:31,280
Uh oh.

6311
04:47:32,580 --> 04:47:33,020
Whoa.

6312
04:47:33,980 --> 04:47:34,920
I can do this.

6313
04:47:35,080 --> 04:47:35,820
Oh, shit!

6314
04:47:36,300 --> 04:47:37,780
Where the fuck did you come from?

6315
04:47:40,420 --> 04:47:42,320
Thank god he didn't land a direct.

6316
04:47:43,740 --> 04:47:44,520
Fucking right, nerd.

6317
04:47:45,020 --> 04:47:45,860
What are you gonna do?

6318
04:47:46,080 --> 04:47:46,440
You know what?

6319
04:47:47,340 --> 04:47:48,460
It's orbital time!

6320
04:47:50,160 --> 04:47:51,900
It's my useless ult time!

6321
04:47:53,320 --> 04:47:54,880
I think he's doing stuff, right?

6322
04:47:55,940 --> 04:47:56,660
I don't know.

6323
04:47:56,700 --> 04:47:57,160
I think so.

6324
04:47:58,300 --> 04:47:59,120
I can't tell.

6325
04:47:59,840 --> 04:48:01,600
I don't intimidate.

6326
04:48:01,600 --> 04:48:02,120
I can't tell.

6327
04:48:02,900 --> 04:48:03,500
Oh.

6328
04:48:05,220 --> 04:48:06,740
I hear the Pharah.

6329
04:48:07,040 --> 04:48:08,160
Bro, that's not even Pharah, bro.

6330
04:48:08,600 --> 04:48:09,640
Ha ha ha ha!

6331
04:48:11,040 --> 04:48:11,640
Horrible.

6332
04:48:14,400 --> 04:48:15,000
Oh.

6333
04:48:16,980 --> 04:48:18,260
Oh, shit!

6334
04:48:18,520 --> 04:48:20,260
Where did you come from?

6335
04:48:21,080 --> 04:48:23,140
Where did the baby come from?

6336
04:48:24,900 --> 04:48:25,620
Hey, we did it.

6337
04:48:25,760 --> 04:48:26,700
I told you.

6338
04:48:29,120 --> 04:48:30,100
You mean...

6339
04:48:30,100 --> 04:48:31,120
God damn.

6340
04:48:34,640 --> 04:48:37,960
We just gave them the fucking meat.

6341
04:48:44,580 --> 04:48:45,920
God damn.

6342
04:48:49,620 --> 04:48:52,200
There wasn't even an opponent.

6343
04:48:52,780 --> 04:48:54,140
I told you!

6344
04:48:54,380 --> 04:48:56,200
My point has been proven!

6345
04:48:57,040 --> 04:48:59,200
Overwatch has changed!

6346
04:49:00,780 --> 04:49:01,620
Ha ha ha ha!

6347
04:49:02,550 --> 04:49:03,900
I told you!

6348
04:49:04,480 --> 04:49:07,020
My point was proving!

6349
04:49:07,780 --> 04:49:09,120
Ha ha ha ha!

6350
04:49:11,440 --> 04:49:13,160
The meat was...

6351
04:49:13,160 --> 04:49:14,840
You guys were right!

6352
04:49:15,680 --> 04:49:17,500
No one has it.

6353
04:49:20,480 --> 04:49:22,140
David, thank you for the super chat.

6354
04:49:22,200 --> 04:49:22,740
Thank you, thank you.

6355
04:49:22,800 --> 04:49:23,980
Okay, we're calling it here though.

6356
04:49:24,180 --> 04:49:25,220
We're calling it here.

6357
04:49:25,420 --> 04:49:26,480
Ha ha ha ha!

6358
04:49:27,960 --> 04:49:29,920
Ha ha ha ha!

6359
04:49:30,780 --> 04:49:31,320
Ha ha ha ha!

6360
04:49:33,060 --> 04:49:35,760
We're gonna call it here for real.

6361
04:49:36,120 --> 04:49:37,300
That was...

6362
04:49:37,300 --> 04:49:39,440
Oh my god.

6363
04:49:40,720 --> 04:49:42,380
I told you guys.

6364
04:49:42,760 --> 04:49:44,100
I told you!

6365
04:49:44,360 --> 04:49:47,080
Nobody believed me!

6366
04:49:49,740 --> 04:49:53,480
Nobody believed me, but I was right!

6367
04:49:53,840 --> 04:49:55,200
I knew it!

6368
04:49:55,400 --> 04:49:56,880
I knew it!

6369
04:49:58,520 --> 04:50:00,200
But I'm so close to ranking.

6370
04:50:00,780 --> 04:50:01,240
You're right.

6371
04:50:01,520 --> 04:50:02,600
You're right guys.

6372
04:50:02,820 --> 04:50:04,680
I'm so close to ranking up though.

6373
04:50:05,200 --> 04:50:05,760
Wait.

6374
04:50:06,080 --> 04:50:06,980
Wait a minute.

6375
04:50:07,280 --> 04:50:07,840
But what...

6376
04:50:07,840 --> 04:50:08,860
But what if?

6377
04:50:09,300 --> 04:50:10,660
Chat, but what if...

6378
04:50:10,660 --> 04:50:11,340
Ha ha ha ha!

6379
04:50:13,080 --> 04:50:16,020
But what if I rank up to Masters right now?

6380
04:50:16,360 --> 04:50:17,300
Ha ha ha ha!

6381
04:50:17,420 --> 04:50:18,620
Don't do it.

6382
04:50:20,540 --> 04:50:21,660
It's just...

6383
04:50:21,660 --> 04:50:23,060
It's just two more wins.

6384
04:50:23,260 --> 04:50:26,180
If I win two more, I'll be Master.

6385
04:50:26,460 --> 04:50:27,440
I'll be...

6386
04:50:27,440 --> 04:50:29,180
I'll be Diamond 1.

6387
04:50:29,480 --> 04:50:30,540
And then I'll be...

6388
04:50:30,780 --> 04:50:31,660
Okay, I'm gonna stop.

6389
04:50:31,800 --> 04:50:32,560
I'm gonna stop.

6390
04:50:32,640 --> 04:50:33,100
But that was fun.

6391
04:50:33,340 --> 04:50:34,920
I actually had a lot of fun there.

6392
04:50:35,180 --> 04:50:35,760
It was a lot.

6393
04:50:35,920 --> 04:50:37,380
It was all over the place.

6394
04:50:37,460 --> 04:50:41,380
The bot watchers are gonna be like Oh no, she played for five hours.

6395
04:50:41,880 --> 04:50:46,860
She must have... I wanna get off Mr. Toki's wild ride.

6396
04:50:47,200 --> 04:50:48,300
Thank you to Super Chat Cats.

6397
04:50:48,620 --> 04:50:49,000
Thank you.

6398
04:50:49,020 --> 04:50:49,640
Thank you.

6399
04:50:50,320 --> 04:50:50,800
Like...

6400
04:50:50,800 --> 04:50:52,240
Oh my god.

6401
04:50:52,340 --> 04:50:54,400
The first... The first half...

6402
04:50:54,400 --> 04:50:56,580
The first two hours... Rough.

6403
04:50:56,800 --> 04:50:57,580
Very rough.

6404
04:50:57,900 --> 04:50:58,380
But...

6405
04:50:58,380 --> 04:51:00,060
We... It got better.

6406
04:51:00,780 --> 04:51:01,720
It got better.

6407
04:51:04,820 --> 04:51:06,460
I told you guys.

6408
04:51:06,600 --> 04:51:07,560
I told you guys.

6409
04:51:07,700 --> 04:51:08,720
It can get better.

6410
04:51:08,840 --> 04:51:10,660
There's always a light at the end of the tunnel.

6411
04:51:12,900 --> 04:51:14,080
But I had a lot of fun.

6412
04:51:14,460 --> 04:51:15,920
I told the Juno strat.

6413
04:51:16,040 --> 04:51:17,240
I perfected the Juno strat.

6414
04:51:17,360 --> 04:51:21,460
The moment I perfected the Juno strat, everything got so much easier.

6415
04:51:21,620 --> 04:51:23,280
Like, life just got easier.

6416
04:51:23,580 --> 04:51:23,960
I would...

6417
04:51:26,180 --> 04:51:27,600
Oh my god.

6418
04:51:29,400 --> 04:51:29,840
Anyway.

6419
04:51:30,620 --> 04:51:33,860
I hope you guys had a great time watching.

6420
04:51:34,520 --> 04:51:35,800
Thank you to Super Chat.

6421
04:51:35,880 --> 04:51:36,120
Thank you.

6422
04:51:36,140 --> 04:51:37,620
Do you know the definition of insanity?

6423
04:51:37,960 --> 04:51:39,660
It's not insanity if we win, guys.

6424
04:51:40,180 --> 04:51:42,560
It's not insanity if we win, chat.

6425
04:51:44,760 --> 04:51:45,200
Anyway.

6426
04:51:45,860 --> 04:51:46,300
Anyway.

6427
04:51:46,420 --> 04:51:47,160
It was really fun.

6428
04:51:47,340 --> 04:51:49,060
I hope you guys had a lot of fun watching, too.

6429
04:51:50,260 --> 04:51:52,740
As always, everybody stay hydrated.

6430
04:51:53,060 --> 04:51:53,680
Posture check.

6431
04:51:53,800 --> 04:51:54,520
Get up and move around.

6432
04:51:55,380 --> 04:51:57,340
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

6433
04:51:58,040 --> 04:51:58,400
Sorry.

6434
04:51:58,400 --> 04:52:00,660
For a moment, I forgot what the next line was.

6435
04:52:02,580 --> 04:52:04,080
It's not Overwatch's fault, though.

6436
04:52:04,140 --> 04:52:05,080
It's just silly me.

6437
04:52:05,180 --> 04:52:06,060
I'm just so stupid.

6438
04:52:06,220 --> 04:52:06,760
Right, Overwatch?

6439
04:52:07,340 --> 04:52:07,700
Yeah.

6440
04:52:09,100 --> 04:52:09,900
Anyway, guys.

6441
04:52:10,260 --> 04:52:11,640
As always, everybody stay hydrated.

6442
04:52:11,840 --> 04:52:12,280
Posture check.

6443
04:52:12,300 --> 04:52:13,700
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

6444
04:52:13,880 --> 04:52:16,700
And if you stay up for me, head to bed because you deserve it.

6445
04:52:16,820 --> 04:52:17,920
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

6446
04:52:18,500 --> 04:52:19,200
Bye, guys.

6447
04:52:19,940 --> 04:52:20,300
Bye.

6448
04:52:22,120 --> 04:52:23,200
I love Overwatch.

6449
04:52:23,440 --> 04:52:23,800
Bye.
