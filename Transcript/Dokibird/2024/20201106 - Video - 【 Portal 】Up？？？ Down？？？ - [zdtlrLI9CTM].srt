1
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:08,420
Okay.

2
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:09,940
Okay.

3
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:10,600
Alright.

4
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:13,160
This is gonna be interesting.

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:14,460
Also, hello everyone.

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:21,560
Hello, Lieutenant, Deadpool, Sayori, Maple, Skulltaker,
Dylan.

7
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:23,560
Oh, who else?

8
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:23,920
Who else?

9
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:24,420
Who else?

10
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:25,300
I think Redder.

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:26,620
Alright, hey guys.

12
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:31,620
Okay, this is gonna be interesting chat because I've never,
never played Portal before.

13
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:34,340
Oh my god.

14
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,040
That's funny.

15
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,160
Thank you so much for the, for the, oh shit.

16
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,500
Oh, I knew I forgot something.

17
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,720
I forgot to add my alert box.

18
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,940
Look, I told you this is scuffed, okay?

19
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:47,100
All right, okay, let me replay this.

20
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,060
I forgot to add my alert box.

21
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,420
I was like, I must be missing something, right?

22
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,780
I'm missing something, right?

23
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:54,340
And it's my alert box.

24
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:03,280
Can we get some bark nights real quick for S&E for the tier
one sub for five months.

25
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,160
Also, bark nights for lieutenant, too.

26
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,100
Holy shit.

27
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,340
Okay, I don't know if I should play music.

28
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:12,600
Do I play music in the background for this chat?

29
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:17,000
Because this is what we hear.

30
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,420
Like, damn.

31
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,380
Do I play music in the background?

32
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:25,440
I don't know if it'll, like, fuck up the immersion or
whatever.

33
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,660
All right, all right, all right.

34
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,200
New game.

35
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,720
Chapter one.

36
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:33,180
All right.

37
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:36,840
I've never played Portal before, so Portal soundtrack kind
of slaps.

38
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:37,240
All right.

39
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:42,460
Alright, alright guys, I guess you can backseat game, uh,
because I'll be so fucking embarrassed.

40
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:47,580
Try to figure shit out, and then I'll be like, oh, I can
play right now?

41
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:49,020
How do I pick shit up?

42
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,720
Can I pick shit up?

43
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,400
Oh, shit, I can walk.

44
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,760
Okay, I can jump.

45
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:57,500
Alright.

46
00:01:58,960 --> 00:01:59,820
I'm learning.

47
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:00,560
I'm learning.

48
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:01,840
Oh my god!

49
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:06,940
Hello, and, oh, again, welcome to the Aperture Science
Computer Aided Instruments Center.

50
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:13,800
Oh my god, Ramstead, can we Can we so much of the tier 1 19
ones?

51
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:18,160
And we are now ready to begin the test proper Okay, I'm just
listening real quick Can we get some work?

52
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:19,280
Can we do a quick for Ramstead?

Excuse me?

70
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,420
Are you kidding me?

71
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:45,960
Okay, there, there.

72
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:54,340
Apparently, I am not very good at physics across the exit
this aperture science material emancipation grin will

73
00:03:54,340 --> 00:04:00,820
vaporize any unauthorized equipment all right first puzzle
first puzzle's done for instance the aperture science

74
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:10,280
repeated storage cube i'm so smart i passed level one i'm
gonna see this is so sad this is so yes please clap for me

75
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:18,620
congrat you're so smart duke you're so smart wow how you did

76
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:27,880
smart i'm very smart god is so embarrassing place the
weighted storage cube on the 1500 megawatt aperture science

77
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:36,800
heavy duty super colliding super button you put that cube i
know right shit who else could do that not your only me oh

78
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,410
okay here

79
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:56,210
oh what what oh What?

80
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,050
I get it!

81
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:00,190
Let me in!

82
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:04,370
Oh, okay.

83
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:06,490
Is this timed?

84
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:08,030
It's timed, right?

85
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:10,570
Oh, gotcha!

86
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:12,630
Perfect.

87
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:20,370
Please move quickly to the chamber lock as the effects of
prolonged exposure to- This is the user one reason.

88
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:24,470
Okay, it's timed.

89
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:28,750
Okay, okay, I'm slowly I'm slowly learning the mechanics.

90
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:36,230
It has to defy physics and force the camp through- I didn't-
I thought it was a glitch, okay?

91
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:40,790
I thought it was a glitch.

92
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:44,770
Is there bee hopping here?

93
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:45,510
I'm bee hopping.

94
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,000
Very slowly, very slowly.

95
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:52,760
Hey, Suna!

96
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,820
I'm trying to learn right now.

97
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,220
It's a...

98
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,200
It's like...

99
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,600
It is technically an FPS.

100
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:03,660
Oh shit, really?

101
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,600
It's not part of any test protocol.

102
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,320
It should already be a guide.

103
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:10,840
Oh my god!

104
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,960
I actually don't know how to beat hop.

105
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,040
I...

106
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:18,720
Oh, you're enjoying Portal?

107
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,420
I did!

108
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,720
I got past level one!

109
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:23,840
It's apparently very hard from what my chat told me.

110
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,100
Level one is a very hard game.

111
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:39,580
oh very good okay i got the portal done you ever played no
i've never played halfway i think i i've not played a lot of

112
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:49,420
games only to let you can pass along this game will make you
grow wrinkles all right however has not do not touch the

113
00:06:49,420 --> 00:07:01,900
operational end of the device do not look directly at the
the tier three eight months under no circumstances should

114
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:16,380
move anyone okay some park nights real quick for oh my god
atlas thank you thank you for the i'm sorry i think i i i

115
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:27,660
don't know if i can help you with that i don't know if that
will help but thank you atlas for the 50 thank you so much a

116
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:47,870
beaters say thank you for actually i wanted to say that yeah
okay oh my god i'm so smart how do i oh my god i'm so smart

117
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:58,270
okay to be fair i just to be honest i just spammed i just
spammed shots until it worked i wasn't i don't know how i

118
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:05,990
did it but i did it Thank you again, Roy, for the fucking
tears they're so crazy.

119
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:07,190
And also the $50.

120
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:13,910
Dude, I didn't even think about where to shoot it.

121
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:15,070
It just happened naturally.

122
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:16,690
Welcome to test chamber four.

123
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:18,490
You're doing quite well.

124
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:19,470
You do so well.

125
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:26,210
To ensure the safe performance of all authorized activities,
do not destroy vital testing apparatus.

126
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:28,610
What is this?

127
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:33,150
Did it work?

128
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:34,250
Oh!

129
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:38,770
I thought this was it!

130
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:40,990
I thought this was the thing!

131
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:45,470
Oh my god, I'm so fucking stupid.

132
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:49,010
Please.

133
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,260
You broke so much so much.

134
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,100
This solid puzzle.

135
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,300
We will not monitor the next test.

136
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:05,160
You will be entirely on your own.

137
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:05,980
Good luck.

138
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:07,720
Okay.

139
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,580
Is this still level one?

140
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,300
I can't even tell.

141
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:17,570
I think right click and left click do the different portal
colors.

142
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:21,530
Oh, I just been spamming left click until it works.

143
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:24,090
I don't know what I'm doing.

144
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:26,930
I don't know what I'm doing.

145
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,900
Oh my god.

146
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,900
God, I'm so fucking smart.

147
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:49,220
Okay, where's the other one, though?

148
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:51,660
Is it this?

149
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,980
Oh, my God!

150
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:56,200
Holy shit!

151
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,540
I'm so sorry!

152
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,300
This is really long level one.

153
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:06,480
So we're gonna get stuck here only on level one.

154
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,140
It was an outright fabrication.

155
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:09,700
Good job.

156
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:10,840
Oh, good job.

157
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,420
As part of a required test protocol.

158
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,140
We will stop enhancing the truth in three.

159
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:16,860
I'm a big brain.

160
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,100
I am a big brain.

161
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:20,420
Huh?

162
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:27,590
Where the fuck am I?

163
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:30,990
What?

164
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,280
What?

165
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,000
What happened?

166
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,540
I don't even know what happened.

167
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:44,580
What the fuck?

168
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,100
What the fuck happened?

169
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:55,940
If I don't even let you down require your brain power, I see
this game going so well.

170
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,240
What is this?

171
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:57,440
Oh!

172
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,720
The Aperture Science High Energy Goals.

173
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,780
The Aperture Science High Energy...

174
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:03,960
Okay.

175
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,880
Okay, okay, look.

176
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:06,620
I...

177
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:10,100
The Aperture Science High Energy Goals.

178
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:18,280
The Aperture Science High Energy Pallet, seen to the left of
the chamber, can and has caused prominent disabilities, such

00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,920
My brain is slowly expanding.

197
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,640
It is getting bigger and bigger.

198
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,060
Oh shit, oh yeah, guys.

199
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:19,300
You saw what happened on Twitter for me, right?

Like, I was supposed to stream at 10 and then all the Gura
shit that happened.

201
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,140
Basically, okay, so...

00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,240
Wait, let me get here.

00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,400
I need to listen.

205
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:41,080
an unsatisfactory mark on your official testing record
followed by dead good luck okay so i was supposed to stream

206
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:50,040
um are you sure you fell geometry oh my god i was about
jumped out okay so what happened was that basically the

207
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:56,820
whole guru shit apparently apparently is this what i'm
supposed to do what am i supposed to do

208
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:12,780
is this is this it okay so apparently Okay, so apparently
Gura accidentally, she didn't know and she fucking...

209
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:13,500
Wait, what?

210
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:20,230
Where do I...

211
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:21,690
Where do I tick this?

212
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:29,470
Where is it going?

213
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:36,190
Where is this going?

214
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:38,450
Like this?

215
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:48,460
Where...

216
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:49,400
Where are you going?

217
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,980
Wait, did I do it?

218
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:54,820
Oh, no, wait, are we not?

219
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:57,740
Wait.

220
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,320
What is this?

221
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:04,280
Where are you?

222
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:05,440
Oh.

223
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:07,680
I...

224
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:08,640
Oh,

225
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,800
yeah, no, the emails got removed, basically.

226
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:18,640
But I had to, like, deal with all that shit earlier today.

227
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:24,100
What?

228
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,960
Wait, what?

229
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:34,580
Okay, so basically, Gura used emotes that were from an emote
artist that was tracing emotes.

230
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,940
So I had to like... I had... What the fuck?

231
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,600
I'm so fucking confused!

232
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:49,120
So I had to like... I had... I made like a whole social
media post about it, and then she got it removed in an hour

233
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:54,100
after that, which was pretty nice, because usually like, you
know, people don't react that fast.

234
00:15:54,160 --> 00:16:03,680
and stuff so like my um i like i like contacted my friend
that got her emotes chased by that person so guru was using

235
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:16,700
those emotes for what the am i doing where where is it oh my
god can i can i go here where is this okay oh

236
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,800
I'm so confused.

245
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,740
I got it.

246
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:23,640
First try.

247
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,780
Oh, before you go for the death ball.

248
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:29,600
At the end, the light comes through the orange and bounce.

249
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:31,880
Yeah, I didn't even need to read it, Lieutenant.

250
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,080
I didn't even need to read it.

251
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,520
I might have missed, though.

252
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,600
I might have missed the first time.

253
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:41,820
Look.

254
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,240
All right, first try.

255
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:43,740
First try.

256
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,400
Never missed.

257
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:45,520
Never missed once.

258
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:48,000
Look at that.

259
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,240
My brain, my brain is so fucking big.

260
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,700
This is so sad.

261
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,740
This is so fucking sad.

262
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:02,220
Okay, but yeah, it was like a huge mess.

263
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,020
It was such a huge mess of the Gura thing.

264
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:12,580
And then now everyone's like trying to, everyone's trying to
like get in on the, and the whole, like, now that Gura has

265
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:18,620
like new emote slots and stuff, all the emote artists are
trying to get in on it and being like, I'm so sorry about...

266
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,640
How about the whole...

267
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,300
I saw like two emo artists doing sketches.

268
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:24,180
I don't know if he was one of them, and then there was
another one.

269
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:26,840
Uh, there was another emo artist doing sketches.

270
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,760
Hoping to get picked by Guru right now.

271
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,300
Dookie before I...

272
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,860
Every time I take away a slice of the cake.

273
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:35,720
It's okay.

274
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,360
The cake's a lie anyway.

275
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,420
I don't need cake.

276
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:40,620
Oh.

277
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:42,740
Oh, I was like, this is easy.

278
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,460
I could just take it over there.

279
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:46,800
Okay.

280
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:48,220
I'll get this.

281
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:49,960
BAM.

282
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:54,980
The enrichment center apologizes for this clearly- Oh, this
is easy!

283
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:56,100
Boom!

284
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,380
Why the fuck is this easier?

285
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,140
Why was this easier than the last level?

286
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:02,220
Fantastic.

287
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,200
What the fuck?

288
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:08,400
You remained resolute and resourceful in an atmosphere of
extreme pessimism.

289
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,780
How the fuck was this easier?

290
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,480
That's not fair!

291
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:19,600
Okay, okay, okay.

292
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,620
But yeah, I was, uh...

293
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,820
It was pretty chaotic.

294
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:32,100
I- I'm surprised- I'm surprised that no one, like, even,
like, uh, uh, mentioned about, like, gross traced emotes

295
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:32,340
there.

296
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:37,720
Because I- when I saw it, I was like, wait a minute, weren't
those the traced emotes from that artist earlier?

297
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:43,360
And then- and then I was like, what the- uh, it's like, it
has gross art.

298
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,180
Yeah, that's a big- a big opportunity, yeah.

299
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,660
Uh, going crazy, too?

300
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,700
Going crazy about what?

301
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:50,600
Yeah, this is very much about what the fuck did you say to
me?

302
00:19:52,960 --> 00:20:03,680
yeah um but yeah i just couldn't believe that no one noticed
it and i was the only one that like talked about it when he

303
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:11,660
uh where he notes in the q a what is girl girl is the the
the hollow alive uh shark girl uh in the english in the

304
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:15,540
english community and like what the am i supposed to do here

305
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:25,740
oh that's what it's supposed to do that That's what it's
supposed to do.

306
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:30,820
Okay.

307
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:33,980
Where's the portal?

308
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:37,220
Where's the portal?

309
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:40,680
Oh.

310
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:44,320
Did I do it?

311
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:46,800
Is this the other side?

312
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:49,740
No, this is not the other side.

313
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,480
Um.

314
00:20:51,640 --> 00:21:01,680
Oh, yeah, yeah, and then a guru's emotes or New emotes were
were were traced by from other twitch emot artists and she

315
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:05,860
didn't know so then I like taught like I made a Fun time fun
phone died.

316
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:11,220
Oh, yeah, so like no one What the fuck

317
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:25,360
Wait, you will how how did I do this?

318
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:27,940
What?

319
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,340
Wait!

320
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:31,340
Wait!

321
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:33,440
How did I...

322
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,480
Okay, I passed the level.

323
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:39,340
I don't even need to know.

324
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,920
I don't even need to know.

325
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:42,540
I don't even need to know.

326
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,020
I just did it.

327
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,940
I don't know how the fuck I use this.

328
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,260
Here?

329
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,590
I just almost barked.

330
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:53,060
Hit empty.

331
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:54,520
MP fuck.

332
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:55,960
Okay.

333
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,100
Is this momentum?

334
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:01,040
Momentum.

335
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:05,460
The function of mass and velocity is conserved between
portals.

336
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:07,280
Can I do it?

337
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:08,760
You launch yourself.

338
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:11,620
You launch yourself across the...

339
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:12,500
Wait, where's the door?

340
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:13,960
Wait.

341
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:18,130
Where is it?

342
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:19,460
Where is it?

343
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,320
Oh my god, I did it.

344
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,260
I did it.

345
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:33,660
I just think that's how portal works, is each time you go
through, you add mass to one and take get away from the

346
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:33,880
other.

347
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:37,020
So you keep falling eventually you'll make a black hole.

348
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:44,380
I'm pretending to understand you, but...

349
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:49,380
I'm trying my best.

350
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,220
I'm trying my best, chat.

351
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:52,840
I'm trying...

352
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56,340
I'm so...

353
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:57,220
Hi, I ain't gold.

354
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:58,600
I'm good.

355
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,140
I'm good.

356
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:00,200
I'm just...

357
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,680
How hard do you want me to control backseating?

358
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:12,640
um i think like even when i read the vaccine comments to
always provide useful advice is she giving me good advice

359
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:19,200
because i've not been listening i've not been listening at
all honestly but like i feel like even if people try to give

360
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:25,340
me back to gaming advice i still don't understand i still
wouldn't understand because i remember major was trying to i

361
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:29,760
think it was major was trying to explain to me something or
lieutenant and i read it and i was like

362
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:41,480
I don't think I'll understand even oh wait okay we don't oh
oh water bad

363
00:23:44,540 --> 00:24:00,280
what the enrichment center promises to always provide useful
advice for instance

364
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,280
What?

365
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:13,680
For your reference, it takes people an average two hours and
three minutes to compete their game on their first try.

366
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:15,020
Oh.

367
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,460
But I'm not.

368
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,820
I hate, I hate, like, other people.

369
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,360
I'm not average.

370
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:22,900
What is this?

371
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:26,120
Oh, it's this.

372
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,220
I'm just built different.

373
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:34,960
I'm just...

374
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:36,000
Oh, no!

375
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:36,440
No!

376
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:50,110
Oh my god, I'm just built.

377
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,120
Well, you are built different now.

378
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,280
Oh my god, Zatia, thank you so much for the follow.

379
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:03,700
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

380
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:06,980
I'm a buttern, thank you so much.

381
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,660
I'm just built different.

382
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:13,700
How does this even go?

383
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,960
Did I do it right?

384
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:19,880
Oh, I did it.

385
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,920
It's a sad one.

386
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:23,480
Oh, no!

387
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:24,500
No!

388
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,440
I thought...

389
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,180
I thought I was clear.

390
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:41,140
I thought I was clear after that.

391
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:45,080
Sorry, we haven't died yet.

392
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,000
I haven't died yet.

393
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,300
I don't know what you're talking about.

394
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:49,300
Is this...

395
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,440
Okay, all right, we got...

396
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:04,280
Where am I supposed to go?

397
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:05,060
Where?

398
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:06,820
What the...

399
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,120
Dookie touched the bad one?

400
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:20,340
I'm gonna post one of these bad boys every time you get
caught.

401
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,180
Oh my god!

402
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,220
Did I touch the gun?

403
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:24,980
Oh!

404
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,580
I was like, what do I do?

405
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,290
Also, I'm just...

406
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,060
Thank you so much for looking at the other game.

407
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:37,440

00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:47,950
I'm so confused.

445
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:50,630
Oh, she did this for you.

446
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:52,170
This is what she did.

447
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:00,940
Wait, but why?

448
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:08,730
Wait, where is it?

449
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:23,720
Where the fuck is the queue?

450
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:27,120
Where is it?

451
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:31,940
She's just stupid.

452
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,480
Oh my god, I'm so fucking smart.

453
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:38,200
I'm so fucking smart.

454
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,360
Look at that shit.

455
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,520
I didn't need your help anyway.

456
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:44,360
Look at that shit.

457
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:47,420
Boom.

458
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,800
I did it.

459
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:50,720
Let's first try.

460
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:51,420
Let's just try.

461
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:57,420
What do you all mean?

462
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,440
I'm not stupid.

463
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,620
I'm not stupid.

464
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:03,200
I swear.

465
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:05,500
I'm just built different.

466
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,620
I'm just built different, chat.

467
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:16,580
I'm just built, exactly.

468
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,920
I'm just built different.

469
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,900
Some people are just built different.

470
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:25,480
Now that you are in control of both portals, this next test
could take a very, very long time.

471
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:29,800
If you become lightheaded from thirst, feel free to pass
out.

472
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,120
Okay.

473
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:30,480
Okay.

474
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:34,720
See, she said it usually takes a long time, so it's fine.

475
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,120
It has a brain the size of Mars.

476
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,180
It was barely a one brain cell.

477
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:42,600
But it was too, yeah, it's, I'm just built different.

478
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:43,960
Look at that.

479
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:46,480
She said it'll take, she said it'll take a long time.

480
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,060
So, so that's okay.

481
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:50,420
It's supposed to take a long time.

482
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:51,420
Do I do this?

483
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:54,600
Look at that.

484
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:58,240
That's not a brain that's a tumor's proof.

485
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,800
My brain is full of errors to himself.

486
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:04,540
Oh, no.

487
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,400
Where the fuck is this?

488
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,060
Where's the cube?

489
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,000
Oh, there's the cube.

490
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,360
How do I get the cube?

491
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:21,750
Oh, wait, that is not the right way to aim.

492
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:24,130
Is it this?

493
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:26,670
Okay, okay, okay.

494
00:32:28,170 --> 00:32:28,870
Where the fuck?

495
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:29,890
Okay, okay, okay.

496
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:31,930
Okay, I got this.

497
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:34,850
Oh, shit.

498
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:35,570
Look at that.

499
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:36,810
Ringo burr.

500
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:37,470
Ringo.

501
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:40,250
Okay, okay, okay.

502
00:32:41,010 --> 00:32:41,530
I thought you were good.

503
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:42,090
Yeah, exactly.

504
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:42,870
What do you mean?

505
00:32:42,930 --> 00:32:43,570
I didn't miss.

506
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:44,870
I didn't miss.

507
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:46,370
I don't know what you're talking about.

508
00:32:47,170 --> 00:32:48,770
You think I missed shots?

509
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:51,890
That was a headshot right there.

510
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:53,470
Get over there.

511
00:32:57,850 --> 00:32:59,990
Oh my gosh, is this...

512
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:00,690
Wait, wait, wait.

513
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:02,450
I got this.

514
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:03,430
I know what to do.

515
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:05,070
I know what to do.

516
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:07,450
Oh, okay.

517
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:09,010
Okay.

518
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:10,450
Maybe...

519
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:12,090
Maybe I don't know what to...

520
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:12,330
Wait.

521
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:15,430
I know what to do.

522
00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:17,070
I know what to do.

523
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:18,310
Boom!

524
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:19,130
Look at that.

525
00:33:20,010 --> 00:33:20,850
First try.

526
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:23,350
First try.

527
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:26,370
Why make it so...

528
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:27,870
What do you mean?

529
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:30,390
Where's my other...

530
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:32,530
Okay, okay, this is our eighth assignment.

531
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:35,270
Look at that.

532
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:35,650
See?

533
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:37,590
It's gonna go get to the last one.

534
00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:38,630
We're almost straight.

535
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:42,010
Okay.

536
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:43,850
Where did I go after that?

537
00:33:43,870 --> 00:33:44,770
Where's the other one?

538
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:53,930
For your own safety, do not destroy vital testing apparatus.

539
00:33:54,690 --> 00:33:54,970
Wait.

540
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:56,670
Where's the other one?

541
00:33:57,710 --> 00:34:06,030
I- What?

542
00:34:08,930 --> 00:34:09,490
Wait, oh no!

543
00:34:10,910 --> 00:34:12,490
Oh, wait.

544
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:18,330
Wait, where's the- Where's the other cube?

545
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:27,380
Oh!

546
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:31,060
Okay, how do I get out of here though?

547
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:34,140
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

548
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:35,800
Left click.

549
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:39,740
Oh, I'm fucking...

550
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:43,280
Okay.

551
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:48,460
Look.

552
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,740
Sometimes you just build different.

553
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:52,920
There you go.

554
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,260
I'm just built different.

555
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,260
I'm just built different.

556
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:57,820
Look at that.

557
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,720
Wait, wait, this is the entrance way.

558
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:05,740
I walked the... I walked the wrong way.

559
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:06,500
You will be.

560
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,720
I walked the wrong way.

561
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:08,280
way.

562
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:09,540
I'm just a little different.

563
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:10,040
I'm sorry.

564
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:11,500
I'm just a little different.

565
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,860
Just went backwards.

566
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:18,000
I'm sorry there was an open door.

567
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,940
There was an open- you go- you- everyone goes through open
doors.

568
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,900
Summary from success.

569
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:30,560
Okay.

570
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:31,460
Okay chat.

571
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:32,840
I swear.

572
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:33,780
Is this still level one?

573
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,880
Is this still fucking level one?

574
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:38,340
This cannot still be level one.

575
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:49,960
high energy gamma leaking portal technology must be informed
that they may be informed of regulatory compliance issues no

576
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:58,020
further compliance information is required or will be
provided and you are an excellent test subject see she said

577
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:06,360
i'm excellent she said i'm excellent chat there he is 90
brain if the elevator door is open there's no oh do you go

578
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:13,160
through the door everyone goes exactly everyone goes through
open doors What, you go through the closed door?

579
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:15,440
Okay.

580
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:17,640
Where the fuck am I?

581
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:19,180
Huh?

582
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:32,900
Okay, okay.

583
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:34,860
That's clearly not it.

584
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,700
This is fluent in sarcasm, by the way.

585
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:41,480
Well, maybe to you, but to me, I'm like her favorite test
subject.

586
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:42,960
I'm her favorite.

587
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:51,060
Okay, me, just for fun.

588
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:54,140
should put portal on the ceiling for it and move at max
speed.

589
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:56,060
I can't even run what you mean!

590
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:57,980
This is the fastest I go!

591
00:36:58,100 --> 00:36:58,940
Oh, you mean bunny hop?

592
00:36:59,060 --> 00:36:59,760
Do I bunny hop?

593
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,020
Do I bunny hop?

594
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,020
Oh, that didn't work.

595
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:05,580
I don't know if I'm doing it right.

596
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,160
I don't...

597
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:12,240
Here?

598
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,740
Oh, that was not it.

599
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:22,180
That was not it.

600
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:23,740
That was not it.

601
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:30,660
Okay, that was not it, okay.

602
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:34,940
That's not max speed.

603
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,380
How do you...

604
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,220
What do I do?

605
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,580
It'll work one day.

606
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:46,340
Okay, I give up.

607
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,520
Okay, this isn't clear enough.

608
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:48,740
It's clearly not this.

609
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,660
Oh, wait, is it?

610
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,920
Okay, the fucking fuck!

611
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:01,120
Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, it's like this.

612
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:04,740
Is it like this?

613
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:09,370
Oh!

614
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:14,950
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.

615
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:16,910
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, my brain.

616
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:18,870
Brain expanding, brain expanding.

617
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:23,510
Wait, how did I fuck that up?

618
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:27,870
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

619
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:29,510
I...

620
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:29,690
What?

621
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:30,630
Ah!

622
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:32,490
I don't know!

623
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:33,830
Oh, I can!

624
00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:34,930
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know!

625
00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:36,090
I know, I know, I know!

626
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:39,690
I know, I know, I know!

627
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:40,310
Okay, no, I don't.

628
00:38:40,370 --> 00:38:40,930
I don't know.

629
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:44,670
I don't know.

630
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:45,590
I just...

631
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:46,470
I don't know.

632
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:48,510
I just...

633
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:49,010
I don't know.

634
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:49,650
How do I line him up better?

635
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:51,110
How?

636
00:38:51,810 --> 00:38:52,470
How do I...

637
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:53,930
How do I line this up better?

638
00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:56,670
How do I...

639
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:56,750
How do I line this up better?

640
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:56,850
How do I...

641
00:38:58,350 --> 00:38:59,650
Like this?

642
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:01,170
Uh-oh.

643
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:04,750
I'll get it right.

644
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:05,370
Ah!

645
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:10,550
Okay.

646
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:14,810
Oh, he's geometry's not my my strongest geometry.

647
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:16,890
I'll get a geometry.

648
00:39:18,410 --> 00:39:19,950
I'm sorry.

649
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:22,830
Is this...

650
00:39:22,830 --> 00:39:23,430
Is this it?

651
00:39:27,050 --> 00:39:28,870
Wait, I got this, I got...

652
00:39:33,090 --> 00:39:36,610
Oh my god, I almost got it, I almost got it, I almost got
it, he got it!

653
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:41,150
He got it, I'm struggling, I don't know what I'm...

654
00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:47,170
Okay, now they're both up top.

655
00:39:48,170 --> 00:39:50,230
Don't worry, one day we'll get there, one day.

656
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:56,230
Two, this is not a speed run, just remember, two hours is
the speed run time.

657
00:39:56,870 --> 00:39:57,730
That's the speed run.

658
00:39:57,890 --> 00:39:59,130
Two hours is the speed run.

659
00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:00,970
We're doing the average gameplay.

660
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:03,930
The average run of the mill.

661
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:09,830
Oh, oh, I thought I did it.

662
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:13,570
I thought I did it.

663
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:18,570
I was so happy.

664
00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:20,050
I was so happy.

665
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,940
Please, I believe.

666
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:34,820
Why is this so hard?

667
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,420
Why is this so hard?

668
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:41,600
Oh my god!

669
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:44,060
Oh my god!

670
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,860
This is just...

671
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:49,900
This is how you forget this is just a pipe.

672
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:54,860
Wait, you need to put the port at the bottom and one of the
ceiling to progress?

673
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:57,200
Oh!

674
00:40:58,620 --> 00:40:59,360
Oh

675
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:13,600
My god How did I still fuck that up?

676
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,460
How did I manage to fuck that up?

677
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:23,580
Oh my god Oh my god.

678
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:27,920
Oh my god I still managed to fuck that up.

679
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:28,420
How?

680
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:32,840
Please.

681
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:35,660
Please, please.

682
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,300
That's my creeper.

683
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,140
That's me.

684
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:40,380
Where does this even take me?

685
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:43,060
Oh, it's this door.

686
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:46,020
Okay, I already forgot what door was what.

687
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:48,840
How long do you think we've been here?

688
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,200
Three hours.

689
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:51,760
No, actually five hours.

690
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:52,440
Five hours.

691
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:53,440
Five hours.

692
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:55,160
I'm being... I'm being... Oh.

693
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,240
Well then.

694
00:41:57,460 --> 00:41:58,440
Six hours.

695
00:41:58,840 --> 00:41:59,480
Six hours.

696
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:00,280
Six hours.

697
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,820
It is always getting a portal on the floor.

698
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:08,200
It's to aim under you as you fall.

699
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:10,820
Also, all right, just flip me off.

700
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:11,420
It's where...

701
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:12,060
It's where gold?

702
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:13,440
All right, here you go, gold.

703
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:14,500
This is where you.

704
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:15,880
This is where you, gold.

705
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:20,840
Okay.

706
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:23,160
I'm bee hopping.

707
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:23,960
I'm bee hopping.

708
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:28,900
Okay.

709
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,380
Okay, this goes up and down.

710
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:33,680
This goes up and down.

711
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:41,460
A-tweens!

712
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:43,580

01:02:56,070 --> 01:02:57,770
I just need to learn geometry chat.

1077
01:02:58,890 --> 01:03:00,130
I... Geometry?

1078
01:03:02,410 --> 01:03:03,050
Geometry.

1079
01:03:04,850 --> 01:03:05,130
Yeah?

1080
01:03:05,930 --> 01:03:06,250
Wait!

1081
01:03:06,890 --> 01:03:07,850
Oh, no, that's not...

1082
01:03:08,530 --> 01:03:11,510
Oh, my god!

1083
01:03:13,390 --> 01:03:14,030
Oh!

1084
01:03:14,510 --> 01:03:15,550
I do!

1085
01:03:16,290 --> 01:03:17,170
I do!

1086
01:03:18,390 --> 01:03:24,570
It's like, waiting for the positive video to hit the corner
on the TV screen from this game.

1087
01:03:24,690 --> 01:03:26,010
It makes your brain the opposite.

1088
01:03:26,070 --> 01:03:33,990
And a little bit, okay, physics, okay, I just need to learn
geometry and physics, chat, I got this, it's not like I

1089
01:03:33,990 --> 01:03:46,590
almost spelled geometry, I just, wait, wait, wait, no, wait,
no, okay, do, here, this is, is it angled correctly, I'm

1090
01:03:46,590 --> 01:03:53,850
just gonna wait until it's angled, and equals angled, angles
out, okay, okay, Pythagoras theorem, I just need the

1091
01:03:53,850 --> 01:03:55,810
Pythagorean theorem, right?

1092
01:03:56,070 --> 01:03:57,750
Okay, is this angled now?

1093
01:03:58,690 --> 01:03:59,650
Oh, no, it's not.

1094
01:04:01,750 --> 01:04:02,230
Here?

1095
01:04:12,740 --> 01:04:14,280
I'm learning geometry!

1096
01:04:16,380 --> 01:04:17,260
Oh my god, did I do it?

1097
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:19,060
Wait, where did it go?

1098
01:04:23,410 --> 01:04:24,390
Is it here?

1099
01:04:25,390 --> 01:04:26,390
Am I learning it?

1100
01:04:28,190 --> 01:04:29,430
Where does my thing go?

1101
01:04:32,710 --> 01:04:33,230
Here?

1102
01:04:36,270 --> 01:04:36,790
Oh!

1103
01:04:38,550 --> 01:04:39,350
I'm wondering!

1104
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:40,610
I'm just going there.

1105
01:04:42,570 --> 01:04:43,090
Wait.

1106
01:04:43,370 --> 01:04:43,530
Wait.

1107
01:04:44,090 --> 01:04:44,090
Wait.

1108
01:04:44,390 --> 01:04:44,570
Wait.

1109
01:04:44,830 --> 01:04:44,830
Wait.

1110
01:04:45,050 --> 01:04:45,050
Wait.

Wait.

1112
01:04:45,790 --> 01:04:46,530
Where is it?

1113
01:04:47,030 --> 01:04:47,570
Oh, wait.

1114
01:04:47,790 --> 01:04:48,350
No, that's not it.

1115
01:04:48,470 --> 01:04:48,970
That's not it.

1116
01:04:49,010 --> 01:04:49,570
I was not...

1117
01:04:50,330 --> 01:04:50,930
Is it here?

1118
01:04:51,790 --> 01:04:54,190
I'm just doing it until it works, chat.

1119
01:04:54,910 --> 01:04:55,870
I'll get there.

1120
01:04:56,870 --> 01:04:57,670
I'll get there.

1121
01:04:58,730 --> 01:05:00,510
I'll get there very quickly.

1122
01:05:00,530 --> 01:05:01,150
Slowly.

1123
01:05:05,510 --> 01:05:07,310
Okay, that's not it.

1124
01:05:08,750 --> 01:05:08,910
Huh?

1125
01:05:11,970 --> 01:05:12,670
Everybody left her?

1126
01:05:12,750 --> 01:05:14,150
There's a zombie zombie.

1127
01:05:14,870 --> 01:05:15,170
Okay.

1128
01:05:15,830 --> 01:05:16,350
Wait.

1129
01:05:16,770 --> 01:05:17,370
Is it this?

1130
01:05:17,890 --> 01:05:19,390
No, it's going down.

1131
01:05:19,930 --> 01:05:20,470
It's going.

1132
01:05:20,930 --> 01:05:22,350
I don't know.

1133
01:05:23,350 --> 01:05:23,910
Please.

1134
01:05:25,330 --> 01:05:27,230
How do I do this?

1135
01:05:28,870 --> 01:05:29,690
See?

1136
01:05:30,890 --> 01:05:31,930
I'm gonna

1137
01:05:35,890 --> 01:05:38,670
watch the whole frame.

1138
01:05:39,790 --> 01:05:42,230
I'm so confused, chat.

1139
01:05:43,970 --> 01:05:44,910
This is it?

1140
01:05:48,550 --> 01:05:50,150
Wait, the ball is supposed to go...

1141
01:05:58,480 --> 01:05:59,000
Wait!

1142
01:05:59,520 --> 01:05:59,720
Wait!

1143
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:03,380
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1144
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:05,080
Oh, I forgot.

1145
01:06:06,060 --> 01:06:07,500
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1146
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:07,660
Wait!

1147
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:14,680
Oh!

1148
01:06:15,140 --> 01:06:15,480
Wait!

1149
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:16,220
This

1150
01:06:22,380 --> 01:06:24,260
is it!

1151
01:06:25,780 --> 01:06:26,220
Wait!

1152
01:06:27,780 --> 01:06:28,360
No?

1153
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:30,920
No?

1154
01:06:32,420 --> 01:06:34,480
Also, thank you so much for the follow.

1155
01:06:34,820 --> 01:06:35,200
Check.

1156
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:36,660
Thank you.

1157
01:06:37,900 --> 01:06:39,900
Thank you for the follow.

1158
01:06:41,140 --> 01:06:42,620
Here's the blood art.

1159
01:06:43,620 --> 01:06:44,940
Thank you so much.

1160
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:47,000
Okay.

1161
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:51,200
Here?

1162
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:04,180
Oh, you did it!

1163
01:07:04,220 --> 01:07:05,400
Oh, I'm so sorry!

1164
01:07:08,260 --> 01:07:08,520
Whoa!

1165
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:10,120
I'm so sorry!

1166
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:15,120
I...

1167
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:17,320
Oh my god, I'm so fucking sorry!

1168
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:20,480
God, I didn't need any of your help.

1169
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:21,380
Look at that shit!

1170
01:07:21,660 --> 01:07:22,640
How do I get out of here?

1171
01:07:23,220 --> 01:07:26,220
Wait, how do I get out?

1172
01:07:28,420 --> 01:07:29,500
How do I...

1173
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:30,980
How do I get out?

1174
01:07:35,080 --> 01:07:37,360
Wait, what do I get out of here?

1175
01:07:39,540 --> 01:07:47,800
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, I got this,
I got this, I land here, right?

1176
01:07:48,460 --> 01:07:50,720
And then, oh, the portal doesn't work there.

1177
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:54,040
Oh, oh,

1178
01:07:57,570 --> 01:07:58,970
I know, I know, I know.

1179
01:08:00,110 --> 01:08:01,930
Boom, oh, wait.

1180
01:08:05,190 --> 01:08:12,290
And then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then!

1181
01:08:15,510 --> 01:08:17,710
I'll get there!

1182
01:08:18,250 --> 01:08:21,290
I'll, you're overthinking this!

1183
01:08:24,390 --> 01:08:26,930
Okay, I'm overthinking this, it's simple.

1184
01:08:27,210 --> 01:08:28,570
It's simple geometry.

1185
01:08:29,530 --> 01:08:31,270
It's simple geometry chat.

1186
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:37,280
She didn't get there.

1187
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:41,040
Okay.

1188
01:08:43,840 --> 01:08:44,800
Simple geometry.

1189
01:08:45,620 --> 01:08:46,380
I passed math.

1190
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:48,240
I got an A plus in geometry.

1191
01:08:50,340 --> 01:08:51,400
Look at that.

1192
01:08:51,940 --> 01:08:52,240
Okay.

1193
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:54,280
And then look at that.

1194
01:08:54,700 --> 01:08:55,200
We did it.

1195
01:08:55,220 --> 01:08:55,640
We did it.

1196
01:08:56,240 --> 01:08:57,080
I did it.

1197
01:08:57,340 --> 01:08:58,600
I did it, chat.

1198
01:08:59,020 --> 01:08:59,880
I did it.

1199
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:03,460
Wait, oh, I thought I was on this.

1200
01:09:04,100 --> 01:09:05,080
Now you're dead.

1201
01:09:08,390 --> 01:09:08,770
Okay.

1202
01:09:08,790 --> 01:09:12,630
Yeah, 30 minutes, this is only, wait, what?

1203
01:09:13,110 --> 01:09:15,030
Oh, it's okay.

1204
01:09:16,270 --> 01:09:17,790
Oh, don't teach me, fuck it.

1205
01:09:20,390 --> 01:09:25,730
I thought it was the movie.

1206
01:09:27,430 --> 01:09:29,110
Oh, I'm so dumb.

1207
01:09:30,530 --> 01:09:31,730
Hound it on.

1208
01:09:36,470 --> 01:09:37,070
Oh.

1209
01:09:41,230 --> 01:09:43,750
Thank you so much for the one vid hyper.

1210
01:09:43,930 --> 01:09:44,850
Thank you, thank you.

1211
01:09:44,890 --> 01:09:46,290
I really do appreciate it.

1212
01:09:46,530 --> 01:09:47,530
Thank you so much.

1213
01:09:47,950 --> 01:09:49,290
Okay, okay, I got this.

1214
01:09:49,450 --> 01:09:50,230
I got this.

1215
01:09:52,270 --> 01:09:52,830
I...

1216
01:09:55,070 --> 01:09:55,630
Okay.

1217
01:09:56,390 --> 01:09:57,310
Okay, did you do...

1218
01:09:57,310 --> 01:09:58,910
Okay, look, look, chat.

1219
01:10:02,910 --> 01:10:03,470
Right?

1220
01:10:05,290 --> 01:10:05,850
Oh!

1221
01:10:06,170 --> 01:10:06,730
Right.

1222
01:10:07,150 --> 01:10:08,290
And then...

1223
01:10:08,290 --> 01:10:08,770
Right.

1224
01:10:08,790 --> 01:10:09,590
right?

1225
01:10:10,290 --> 01:10:10,810
Oh!

1226
01:10:12,590 --> 01:10:14,850
I just need to wait for this.

1227
01:10:17,070 --> 01:10:18,250
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1228
01:10:18,390 --> 01:10:20,370
I got- Oh, oh, oh, oh.

1229
01:10:21,010 --> 01:10:22,970
I actually scared myself there.

1230
01:10:25,590 --> 01:10:26,550
Look, that's me.

1231
01:10:27,570 --> 01:10:28,170
That's me.

1232
01:10:28,730 --> 01:10:30,410
Okay, now I just gotta wait for this.

1233
01:10:32,890 --> 01:10:34,290
Look at that.

1234
01:10:34,510 --> 01:10:34,950
God.

1235
01:10:36,470 --> 01:10:37,050
Look at that.

1236
01:10:37,270 --> 01:10:40,550
Only 35 minutes have passed since I started this game.

1237
01:10:42,070 --> 01:10:44,010
This is like a speedrun right here.

1238
01:10:45,330 --> 01:10:48,090
This is a speedrun record right here right now.

1239
01:10:48,770 --> 01:10:49,110
Right here.

1240
01:10:49,230 --> 01:10:49,970
Wait, where's my portal?

1241
01:10:50,850 --> 01:10:51,850
Wait, what did I use?

1242
01:10:52,130 --> 01:10:52,590
Wait, what color?

1243
01:10:52,850 --> 01:10:53,990
Guys, what color was the portal?

1244
01:10:54,550 --> 01:10:55,630
What color was it?

1245
01:10:55,890 --> 01:10:56,830
I don't remember.

1246
01:10:57,810 --> 01:10:59,670
I don't want to wait again, chat.

1247
01:11:00,510 --> 01:11:01,630
What color was it, guys?

1248
01:11:02,070 --> 01:11:02,450
Please.

1249
01:11:03,770 --> 01:11:05,290
I'm streaming this game for you.

1250
01:11:05,630 --> 01:11:06,170
It's not orange.

1251
01:11:06,290 --> 01:11:06,810
It's not orange.

1252
01:11:07,050 --> 01:11:09,430
Oh my god, it was orange.

1253
01:11:10,250 --> 01:11:12,190
It was orange!

1254
01:11:12,690 --> 01:11:13,570
Oh, I could have done that.

1255
01:11:14,250 --> 01:11:15,630
I could have done that.

1256
01:11:20,150 --> 01:11:21,110
Okay.

1257
01:11:22,990 --> 01:11:23,310
Okay.

1258
01:11:24,050 --> 01:11:24,330
Alright.

1259
01:11:25,190 --> 01:11:26,270
What do I have to do?

1260

You can donate one or all of your vital organs to Aperture
science and self-esteem learned for girls.

1279
01:13:20,820 --> 01:13:21,420
It's true.

1280
01:13:21,860 --> 01:13:22,700
I did it.

1281
01:13:23,260 --> 01:13:24,060
I did a chat.

1282
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:27,680
Only one minute has passed since I did this level.

1283
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:29,640
Only one minute.

1284
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:30,900
Don't listen to Nightbot.

1285
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:32,560
Like, Nightbot's lying to you.

1286
01:13:33,160 --> 01:13:34,800
I'm improving my algorithm.

1287
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:37,940
I'm expanding my algorithm right now.

1288
01:13:42,820 --> 01:13:44,200
This is so sad.

1289
01:13:48,240 --> 01:13:48,920
There's a...

1290
01:13:48,940 --> 01:13:56,700
reason why we don't do variety the appropriate chamber for
this testing sequence is currently unavailable it has been

1291
01:13:56,700 --> 01:14:09,920
replaced with a nice fireball what more can I say I know
trigonometry geometry and every try okay oh it's the laser

1292
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:14,980
guys can I move them oh I can move them oh what

1293
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:32,940

1323
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:07,460
I was trying to make it shoot itself.

Oh, shit.

1332
01:17:41,420 --> 01:17:43,100
Am I breaking the level?

1333
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:47,880
Why did the music change?

1334
01:17:50,040 --> 01:17:50,480
What?

1335
01:17:59,290 --> 01:18:00,950

1336
01:18:02,750 --> 01:18:03,970
Did I parkour?

1337
01:18:07,750 --> 01:18:08,550
Hey, Raleigh.

01:18:14,050 --> 01:18:15,310
What the fuck is this?

1341
01:18:16,710 --> 01:18:17,430
There's milk.

1342
01:18:21,170 --> 01:18:22,750
Can I use this to reflect people?

1343
01:18:24,430 --> 01:18:26,630
If I bring this out, what is she this instead?

1344
01:18:30,170 --> 01:18:30,950
Oh, no, no.

1345
01:18:31,110 --> 01:18:31,590
That doesn't work.

1346
01:18:31,810 --> 01:18:32,550
That doesn't work.

1347
01:18:35,030 --> 01:18:36,310
That doesn't work.

1348
01:18:39,030 --> 01:18:40,610
That other guy said, I never finished port.

1349
01:18:40,770 --> 01:18:42,030
Wait, where did I come from?

1350

1359
01:19:03,300 --> 01:19:03,880
Does this block?

1360
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:04,720

1361
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:06,840
Oh, it blocks.

1362
01:19:06,980 --> 01:19:07,500

01:19:13,780 --> 01:19:15,440
Oh, it does not block it.

1367
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:18,700
It does not block this.

1368
01:19:19,340 --> 01:19:19,420
Me.

1369
01:19:21,380 --> 01:19:22,960
Wait, I can't even...

1370
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:24,080

01:23:57,160 --> 01:23:58,520
I don't need portals.

1452
01:23:59,080 --> 01:24:00,720
I don't need portals!

1453
01:24:01,240 --> 01:24:02,500
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

This is such a backward way.

1460
01:24:16,060 --> 01:24:17,740
Wait, is this not how you do it?

1461
01:24:18,540 --> 01:24:20,060
Is this how you play the game?

1462
01:24:20,500 --> 01:24:22,100
How else are you supposed to do this?

1463
01:24:26,500 --> 01:24:27,580
Wait, okay, okay.

1464
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:31,020

1466
01:24:33,700 --> 01:24:34,120

So...

1471
01:24:42,180 --> 01:24:45,200
So, this is looking at this way.

1472
01:24:45,800 --> 01:24:46,020
Alright.

1473
01:24:46,860 --> 01:24:47,880

1474
01:24:49,740 --> 01:24:50,260
What?

1475
01:24:50,940 --> 01:24:52,560
There's one way to do it that way.

1476
01:24:54,760 --> 01:24:55,800

1477
01:24:55,800 --> 01:24:56,340

Why else would he give us 20 cubes?

1517
01:27:48,340 --> 01:27:50,580
There's no other way to solve this puzzle.

1518

1566
01:30:53,750 --> 01:30:59,470

1568
01:31:03,350 --> 01:31:07,130

Yeah!

1645
01:36:53,580 --> 01:36:55,140
I need no portal?

1646
01:36:55,800 --> 01:36:57,540
I didn't need a single portal!

1647
01:36:57,840 --> 01:37:00,380
Except for that one portal that I made.

1648
01:37:05,080 --> 01:37:06,820
Yeah, that's right.

1649
01:37:07,300 --> 01:37:08,140
That's right.

Look at that shit.

1651
01:37:10,040 --> 01:37:11,920
I didn't need a single portal.

1652
01:37:12,760 --> 01:37:17,160
I just want to remind you that Android Hell is a real place
where you will be sent.

1653
01:37:17,480 --> 01:37:18,260
This is what I mean.

1654
01:37:18,320 --> 01:37:20,160
Zero to Seed Run incoming.

1655
01:37:21,040 --> 01:37:21,700
Look at that.

1656
01:37:22,160 --> 01:37:24,200
I can't get that for the other ones.

1657
01:37:26,880 --> 01:37:28,760
I didn't need a single portal.

1658
01:37:31,860 --> 01:37:32,980
Look at that shit.

1659
01:37:34,220 --> 01:37:36,220
All I needed was the port of cubes.

1660
01:37:38,380 --> 01:37:42,280
You dropped the cubes on a drone?

1661
01:37:42,720 --> 01:37:44,260
There was literally an X?

1662
01:37:44,980 --> 01:37:45,800
Wait, what?

1663
01:37:46,160 --> 01:37:48,520
Wait, I didn't need to build a portal.

1664
01:37:49,200 --> 01:37:53,260
I didn't need to slowly push the cubes into them.

1665
01:37:54,500 --> 01:37:56,860
Yeah, but I had to see that chamber.

1666
01:37:56,880 --> 01:37:57,620
in this one.

1667
01:37:57,900 --> 01:37:58,780
Please take care of it.

1668
01:37:58,920 --> 01:38:00,540
My four was too strong.

1669
01:38:01,240 --> 01:38:02,760
Four cubes together.

1670
01:38:06,760 --> 01:38:10,560
There's a little morphe on the city of like a rip with some
portals.

1671
01:38:11,140 --> 01:38:12,620
I don't need instructions.

1672
01:38:13,560 --> 01:38:16,140
Who do you think you think you're talking to?

1673
01:38:16,260 --> 01:38:17,500
How the fuck do I get up here?

1674
01:38:17,940 --> 01:38:19,800
You think I need instructions?

1675
01:38:20,700 --> 01:38:21,820
I don't need that.

1676
01:38:22,120 --> 01:38:23,560
I make my own rules.

1677
01:38:24,320 --> 01:38:25,020
Look at that.

1678
01:38:25,840 --> 01:38:26,860
I make my own rules.

1679
01:38:26,880 --> 01:38:40,020
rolls I'm dipping it but don't think I'm watching deep chat

reminds you that the weighted companion cube will never

1682
01:38:55,960 --> 01:38:59,720
threaten to You and, in fact, cannot speak.

1683
01:39:00,700 --> 01:39:01,340
Let me do this.

1684
01:39:01,780 --> 01:39:01,900
Oh!

1685
01:39:02,320 --> 01:39:03,620
I do not do that.

1686
01:39:07,040 --> 01:39:08,940
I, in fact, do not do that.

1687
01:39:10,300 --> 01:39:12,220
Thank you so much for the follow, Lamal.

1688
01:39:12,640 --> 01:39:13,600

Thank you so much.

1692
01:39:18,280 --> 01:39:18,940
Hey, Zero.

1693
01:39:20,520 --> 01:39:21,120
Okay, now I'm dead.

1694
01:39:21,220 --> 01:39:25,920
Someone take over sending jokie curses in heaven when one of
those bad boys.

1695
01:39:26,720 --> 01:39:26,860
Okay.

1696
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:29,060
Boo Boo streamer.

1697
01:39:29,060 --> 01:39:33,740
The symptoms most commonly produced by enrichment center
testing are superstition.

1698
01:39:34,240 --> 01:39:35,980
Perceiving inanimate objects as alive.

1699
01:39:36,620 --> 01:39:44,280
Oh, the enrichment center reminds you that the ancient
companion cube will never threaten to stab your hand.

1700
01:39:44,280 --> 01:39:47,020
Okay, I thought I thought I got the timing wrong.

1701
01:39:47,460 --> 01:39:49,120
I thought I got the timing right.

1702
01:39:49,240 --> 01:39:50,880
But it did.

1703
01:39:52,780 --> 01:39:54,020
It did.

1704
01:39:54,920 --> 01:39:56,060
It did in fact kill me.

1705
01:39:57,320 --> 01:40:01,840
Superstition, perceiving inanimate objects as alive and
hallucinations.

1706
01:40:01,940 --> 01:40:02,920
Let me time this.

1707
01:40:03,040 --> 01:40:07,340
The enrichment center reminds you that the way he got the
comedic timing right.

1708
01:40:07,400 --> 01:40:10,600
You're never present to stab you and, in fact, cannot speak.

1709
01:40:10,600 --> 01:40:11,520
Maybe I do this.

1710
01:40:12,600 --> 01:40:14,180
Okay, I just need crouch time.

1711
01:40:15,420 --> 01:40:16,180
Okay, okay.

1712
01:40:16,360 --> 01:40:17,600
Where is this?

1713
01:40:20,680 --> 01:40:21,280

Yeah!

1715
01:40:23,700 --> 01:40:25,900
You thought you could kill me this time?

1716
01:40:26,880 --> 01:40:27,280
Ouch.

1717
01:40:29,720 --> 01:40:31,640
Yeah, you thought you could kill me?

1718
01:40:32,680 --> 01:40:33,690
I'm better than you.

1719
01:40:34,800 --> 01:40:35,560
I'm better.

1720
01:40:38,260 --> 01:40:39,190

Cube solve.

1725

Where is it?

1726
01:41:04,970 --> 01:41:06,730
Okay, that's the right right now, but still.

1727
01:41:07,890 --> 01:41:08,310
Oh.

1728
01:41:09,250 --> 01:41:09,870
Okay.

1729
01:41:13,820 --> 01:41:14,580
Okay, okay, okay.

All right, all right.

1731

We gotta hit here.

1732
01:41:19,080 --> 01:41:19,440

01:45:26,410 --> 01:45:27,090
Come on.

1794
01:45:27,090 --> 01:45:27,550
Come on.

1795
01:45:28,970 --> 01:45:29,930
Come on.

1796
01:45:29,930 --> 01:45:30,170
Bro.

1797
01:45:30,690 --> 01:45:31,170
Come on.

1798
01:45:32,150 --> 01:45:32,630
Yeah.

1799
01:45:33,130 --> 01:45:33,850
That's right.

1800
01:45:35,590 --> 01:45:36,070
Okay.

1801
01:45:40,710 --> 01:45:41,190
Um...

1802
01:45:41,190 --> 01:45:42,110
Yeah, that was...

1803
01:45:42,130 --> 01:45:43,710
That was, that wasn't it.

1804
01:45:43,990 --> 01:45:45,110
That was, that wasn't it.

1805
01:45:45,810 --> 01:45:46,530
That wasn't.

1806
01:45:48,590 --> 01:45:50,470
This is why I hate coming late to the incident.

1807
01:45:51,050 --> 01:45:51,990
Guys, is she dead?

1808
01:45:53,130 --> 01:45:56,250
Okay, I'm sorry I said she found the best way to play.

1809
01:45:56,690 --> 01:45:57,750
Wait, Jeff, do us again?

1810
01:45:58,110 --> 01:45:59,830
Wait, no, I don't, I don't.

1811
01:45:59,970 --> 01:46:00,370
Oh!

1812
01:46:01,490 --> 01:46:02,470
Wait, never mind.

1813
01:46:02,630 --> 01:46:04,110
I thought, I thought you could go through here.

1814
01:46:06,350 --> 01:46:08,070
I thought you could go through here.

1815
01:46:09,150 --> 01:46:11,590
James got poor and not cute for a reason.

1816
01:46:13,130 --> 01:46:15,930
Wait, wait, chat.

1817
01:46:16,650 --> 01:46:17,690
I have a portal gun.

1818
01:46:18,870 --> 01:46:20,070
I have a portal gun, chat.

1819
01:46:20,790 --> 01:46:22,410
I know, I know what to do now.

1820
01:46:23,070 --> 01:46:23,550
I know, I know.

1821
01:46:23,630 --> 01:46:24,970
My brain expanding, chat.

1822
01:46:25,850 --> 01:46:26,770
Wait, my brain.

1823
01:46:27,510 --> 01:46:28,650
My brain expanding.

1824
01:46:35,450 --> 01:46:36,690
Okay, all right.

1825
01:46:37,210 --> 01:46:37,490
All right.

1826
01:46:38,090 --> 01:46:39,790
Okay, my brain is not...

1827
01:46:39,790 --> 01:46:39,930
Wait.

1828
01:46:41,070 --> 01:46:42,730
You can put a portal there!

1829
01:46:43,370 --> 01:46:43,850
What?

1830
01:46:44,050 --> 01:46:44,170
What?

1831
01:46:44,750 --> 01:46:46,550
Oh my god, wait!

1832
01:46:47,930 --> 01:46:49,870
Wait, wait, wait, let me double check if this works.

1833
01:46:50,370 --> 01:46:51,390
I need a mixture.

1834
01:46:52,350 --> 01:46:53,390
What the fuck?

1835
01:46:53,750 --> 01:46:53,750
What?

1836
01:46:55,350 --> 01:46:58,910
Okay, my brain expanding chat.

1837
01:46:59,770 --> 01:47:00,910
Okay, and then I need it.

1838
01:47:01,930 --> 01:47:03,150
Where do I need this?

1839
01:47:04,270 --> 01:47:05,510
I need it here.

1840
01:47:05,990 --> 01:47:06,310
Alright.

1841
01:47:07,030 --> 01:47:07,910
Alright, wait.

1842
01:47:10,830 --> 01:47:12,090
Where's my cube?

1843
01:47:12,710 --> 01:47:14,730
Holy shit, I'm so fucking sore.

1844
01:47:14,750 --> 01:47:31,850
and then I put this here and then wait boom yeah that's

01:48:21,170 --> 01:48:21,850
Is that crazy?

1852
01:48:22,350 --> 01:48:25,850
The way his companion cube certainly brought you good luck.

1853
01:48:26,790 --> 01:48:30,170
However, it cannot accompany you for the rest of the test.

1854
01:48:30,250 --> 01:48:31,090
Oh my god, help!

1855
01:48:33,430 --> 01:48:35,290
Thank you so much for the fall.

1856
01:48:35,830 --> 01:48:36,570
Thank you, thank you.

1857
01:48:36,710 --> 01:48:38,090
I really do appreciate it.

1858
01:48:38,350 --> 01:48:39,250
Thank you so much.

1859
01:48:39,910 --> 01:48:40,970
I'll have a butthart.

1860
01:48:41,170 --> 01:48:42,210
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1861
01:48:42,790 --> 01:48:44,610
Okay, well, you want me to burn this cube?

1862
01:48:44,750 --> 01:48:44,930
Yeah.

1863
01:48:45,330 --> 01:48:45,990
Do you think I care?

1864
01:48:46,390 --> 01:48:47,910
Do you think I give a fuck about this cube?

1865
01:48:48,150 --> 01:48:48,570
Yeah!

1866
01:48:49,350 --> 01:48:49,910
Yeah!

1867
01:48:50,370 --> 01:48:51,510
How do I burn it?

1868
01:48:51,590 --> 01:48:52,210
Excuse me?

1869
01:48:52,850 --> 01:48:53,110
Hello?

1870
01:48:55,090 --> 01:48:56,350
I said all that?

1871
01:48:57,230 --> 01:48:58,070
I said all that!

1872
01:48:58,210 --> 01:48:59,570
And you're not gonna burn the queue!

1873
01:49:00,490 --> 01:49:07,590
Rest assured that an independent panel of ethicists has
absolved the enrichment center, aperture science employees,

1874
01:49:07,810 --> 01:49:08,670
and- Didn't you care?

1875
01:49:09,270 --> 01:49:10,430
Burn the queue!

1876
01:49:11,330 --> 01:49:13,530
For the companion queue, euthanizing crossings.

1877
01:49:13,530 --> 01:49:15,210
Oh my god, just burn it, please!

1878
01:49:15,330 --> 01:49:16,350
I don't care!

1879
01:49:17,770 --> 01:49:18,330
Yeah!

1880
01:49:19,210 --> 01:49:20,290
Oh wait, did I got burned?

1881
01:49:20,810 --> 01:49:21,370
What the fuck?

1882
01:49:21,550 --> 01:49:22,430
Did it burn me?

1883
01:49:22,690 --> 01:49:23,530
What the fuck?

1884
01:49:27,870 --> 01:49:29,890
Why would it burn the cube?

1885
01:49:30,750 --> 01:49:31,270
Oh.

1886
01:49:32,310 --> 01:49:32,450
Oh.

1887
01:49:32,450 --> 01:49:35,690
Your companion cube cannot accompany you through the rest of
the test.

1888
01:49:36,310 --> 01:49:42,530
If it could talk and the enrichment center takes this
opportunity to remind you that it cannot, it would tell you

1889
01:49:42,530 --> 01:49:47,030
to go on without it because it would rather die in a fire
than become a weapon.

1890
01:49:53,510 --> 01:49:54,590
Yeah, you think I- Whoa!

1891
01:49:54,790 --> 01:49:54,990
What the?

1892
01:49:55,130 --> 01:49:55,410
No!

1893
01:49:55,470 --> 01:49:55,490
No!

1894
01:49:55,490 --> 01:50:00,070
You did it more quickly than any test subject on record.

1895
01:50:00,790 --> 01:50:00,990
Congratulations.

1896
01:50:05,550 --> 01:50:07,330
Look, I thought...

1897
01:50:08,010 --> 01:50:10,210
Look, I thought...

1898
01:50:10,770 --> 01:50:11,830
I wasn't thinking.

1899
01:50:12,710 --> 01:50:14,650
Okay, okay, I wasn't thinking.

1900
01:50:15,510 --> 01:50:16,790
I have to do this again!

1901
01:50:18,190 --> 01:50:19,070
It doesn't...

1902
01:50:21,210 --> 01:50:23,790
Yeah, I'm breeding you twice now after that.

1903
01:50:24,010 --> 01:50:24,330
Yeah, you just...

1904
01:50:24,350 --> 01:50:25,990
to get burned twice.

1905
01:50:26,690 --> 01:50:28,610
Now this dude is like, yeah.

1906
01:50:31,550 --> 01:50:32,610
You know what?

1907
01:50:32,690 --> 01:50:34,710
Yeah, this deserves to get burned twice.

1908
01:50:35,250 --> 01:50:36,270
Make it... Ah!

1909
01:50:44,280 --> 01:50:44,880
Okay.

1910
01:50:45,600 --> 01:50:46,100
Alright.

1911
01:50:47,440 --> 01:50:48,380
Are you...

1912
01:50:48,380 --> 01:50:48,840
Dude!

1913
01:50:49,800 --> 01:50:52,120
Okay, okay, okay.

1914
01:50:53,420 --> 01:50:53,700
Alright.

1915
01:50:54,140 --> 01:50:55,040
I'm just gonna put you here?

1916
01:50:55,560 --> 01:50:56,240
Putting you here.

1917
01:50:56,840 --> 01:50:57,060
Okay.

1918
01:50:57,920 --> 01:50:59,300
It's too big to hold.

1919
01:50:59,940 --> 01:51:12,960
to let it go all right all right it's round two round two of
ruining the cube you did it round two companion cube

1920
01:51:12,960 --> 01:51:20,880
certainly brought you good luck all right however it cannot
accompany you for the rest of the test all right cube i

1921
01:51:20,880 --> 01:51:34,380
already said my goodbyes bye i don't give a I think I care.

1922
01:51:40,480 --> 01:51:40,960
No remorse.

1923
01:51:41,160 --> 01:51:42,020
It killed me!

1924
01:51:42,720 --> 01:51:45,280
Why the fuck would I give a shit after that?

1925
01:51:50,520 --> 01:51:54,080
The experiment is nearing its conclusion.

1926
01:51:54,700 --> 01:51:55,700
Wait, there's instructions.

1927
01:51:56,160 --> 01:51:59,100
It's required to remind you that you will be back.

1928
01:52:00,860 --> 01:52:02,840
No, no, you jumped in there, my dude.

1929
01:52:03,380 --> 01:52:03,380
Cube.

1930
01:52:03,500 --> 01:52:10,960
I thought, okay, to be honest, I thought the lava thingy,
like, there was, like, an invisible wall, so I wouldn't go

1931
01:52:10,960 --> 01:52:12,300
down there, and the cube would.

1932
01:52:12,380 --> 01:52:17,600
I didn't think when you jump in with it, you die with it, I
thought it would just take the cube.

1933
01:52:19,880 --> 01:52:20,340
Okay.

1934
01:52:20,760 --> 01:52:21,280
Cube.

1935
01:52:22,220 --> 01:52:22,740
Hit.

1936
01:52:24,780 --> 01:52:25,300
Hit.

1937
01:52:26,200 --> 01:52:28,580
Top 10 added enemy trails.

1938
01:52:30,660 --> 01:52:31,340
bad.

1939
01:52:33,520 --> 01:52:34,320
Portal jump.

1940
01:52:35,320 --> 01:52:37,660
Portal drone.

1941
01:52:40,320 --> 01:52:41,000
Okay.

1942
01:52:49,590 --> 01:52:49,590
Okay.

1943
01:52:50,050 --> 01:52:51,030
What's this?

1944
01:52:53,930 --> 01:52:54,690
Can I go here?

1945
01:52:55,750 --> 01:52:57,710
All employees must wash their hands.

1946
01:53:11,460 --> 01:53:12,800
Oh, wait, is there more here?

1947
01:53:14,240 --> 01:53:15,020
What is this point?

1948
01:53:15,960 --> 01:53:16,300
What?

1949
01:53:17,420 --> 01:53:18,720
What is the point of this?

1950
01:53:20,520 --> 01:53:22,260
Oh, no, no!

1951
01:53:32,670 --> 01:53:35,410
The experiment is nearing its conclusion.

1952
01:53:36,230 --> 01:53:42,430
The enrichment center is required to remind you that you
will be baked, and then there will be cake.

1953
01:53:45,710 --> 01:53:50,750
Okay, um, anyway, this is his first try.

1954
01:53:52,490 --> 01:53:55,630
Alright, we just don't go over here anymore.

1955
01:53:56,670 --> 01:53:57,730
We just...

1956
01:53:57,750 --> 01:53:59,810
That never existed.

1957
01:54:00,890 --> 01:54:01,230
What?

1958
01:54:08,620 --> 01:54:09,620
What?

1959
01:54:09,960 --> 01:54:10,660
Nothing happened?

1960
01:54:20,490 --> 01:54:20,750
What?

1961
01:54:21,670 --> 01:54:22,350
Oh!

1962
01:54:32,780 --> 01:54:33,780
Oh my god!

1963
01:54:38,350 --> 01:54:40,270
Oh my god!

1964
01:54:44,240 --> 01:54:46,280
I didn't know you could do that.

1965
01:54:49,180 --> 01:54:50,720
Where am I?

1966
01:54:52,180 --> 01:54:54,060
A rainbow chest.

1967
01:54:58,480 --> 01:55:00,840
Please, please look up where I'm at.

1968
01:55:13,250 --> 01:55:14,530
No, I came from here.

1969
01:55:18,450 --> 01:55:19,690
Oh, there's...

1970
01:55:21,230 --> 01:55:22,750
Oh, wait.

1971
01:55:23,070 --> 01:55:24,010
Where am I?

03:26:36,010 --> 03:26:37,230
I was just practicing.

3611
03:26:37,790 --> 03:26:38,030
Chat.

3612
03:26:38,830 --> 03:26:39,630
I was just practicing.

3613
03:26:40,270 --> 03:26:42,790
I had to practice my portal skills, you know?

3614
03:26:43,430 --> 03:26:44,890
Okay, how do I get out of here?

3615
03:26:55,150 --> 03:26:55,670
Look!

3616
03:26:56,970 --> 03:26:57,950
My FPS skills!

3617
03:26:58,270 --> 03:26:58,750
Look at me!

3618
03:26:59,090 --> 03:26:59,450
Look at me!

3619
03:26:59,530 --> 03:27:00,350
I'm head glitching!

3620
03:27:00,650 --> 03:27:01,670
I'm head glitching!

3621
03:27:02,590 --> 03:27:05,610
My FPS skills led me to this!

3622
03:27:07,890 --> 03:27:10,650
To flex and get glitched!

3623
03:27:12,510 --> 03:27:13,070
Look at that.

3624
03:27:15,110 --> 03:27:16,870
Look at that, look at them flex.

3625
03:27:17,470 --> 03:27:18,150
Look it up.

3626
03:27:48,560 --> 03:27:49,680
Okay, I fucked up up.

3627
03:27:50,140 --> 03:27:51,220
I fucked up up.

3628
03:27:53,540 --> 03:27:55,400
I somehow fucked up, guys.

3629
03:27:56,500 --> 03:27:57,000
Okay, okay.

3630
03:28:03,600 --> 03:28:04,640
Oh, whoa, whoa!

3631
03:28:06,340 --> 03:28:07,540
Okay, let me need water.

3632
03:28:07,920 --> 03:28:09,120
I need water.

3633
03:28:14,470 --> 03:28:15,470
Okay, okay, okay.

3634
03:28:17,190 --> 03:28:17,550
Okay.

3635
03:28:18,310 --> 03:28:18,970
Can we do another up?

3636
03:28:19,270 --> 03:28:20,010
We can do another up.

3637
03:28:21,630 --> 03:28:21,670
Okay.

3638
03:28:22,250 --> 03:28:22,910
All right, up.

3639
03:28:24,010 --> 03:28:25,310
And then, and then- Fuph!

3640
03:28:27,470 --> 03:28:29,810
Okay, maybe this is not the right portal for up.

3641
03:28:30,090 --> 03:28:30,970
I was on Black Maria.

3642
03:28:31,230 --> 03:28:32,470
Thank you so much for the follow.

3643
03:28:32,990 --> 03:28:34,130
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

3644
03:28:34,230 --> 03:28:35,830
I really do appreciate it.

3645
03:28:36,450 --> 03:28:37,070
I have a butthart.

3646
03:28:37,250 --> 03:28:38,470
Oh, thank you so much.

3647
03:28:38,590 --> 03:28:39,450
Oh, have a butthart.

3648
03:28:39,630 --> 03:28:40,550
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

3649
03:28:40,750 --> 03:28:42,670
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

3650
03:28:42,810 --> 03:28:47,990
Maybe I need, um, maybe up here?

3651
03:28:48,770 --> 03:28:49,510
Up here.

3652
03:28:50,870 --> 03:28:51,530
Yes!

3653
03:28:52,070 --> 03:28:52,290
Up!

3654
03:28:54,390 --> 03:28:57,890
Up, up, up, up, up, up, up.

3655
03:28:57,970 --> 03:28:57,990
Okay.

3656
03:29:00,810 --> 03:29:01,930
Now down.

3657
03:29:02,890 --> 03:29:04,770
Down, down, down, down.

3658
03:29:05,510 --> 03:29:11,310
I always think when the original game is hot right now and
you you two?

3659
03:29:11,550 --> 03:29:12,050
I am?

3660
03:29:12,730 --> 03:29:14,550
You can just do old classics?

3661
03:29:18,290 --> 03:29:18,730
Okay.

3662
03:29:19,670 --> 03:29:20,650
Wait, where did I come from?

3663
03:29:20,750 --> 03:29:21,390
Oh, I came from here.

3664
03:29:21,950 --> 03:29:22,190
Right?

3665
03:29:22,550 --> 03:29:23,630
Yeah, yeah, because there's door.

3666
03:29:34,760 --> 03:29:35,640
Look, I'm bunny hopping.

3667
03:29:36,360 --> 03:29:38,040
I don't think this is actually bunny hopping.

3668
03:29:40,520 --> 03:29:40,960
But...

3669
03:29:40,960 --> 03:29:41,560
Okay.

3670
03:29:43,100 --> 03:29:43,660
Oh, shit.

3671
03:29:43,800 --> 03:29:44,380
Is this GLaDOS?

3672
03:29:45,180 --> 03:29:46,300
GLaDOS, is this you?

3673
03:29:46,800 --> 03:29:48,260
Look, are you proud of me?

3674
03:29:48,260 --> 03:29:51,680
Are you proud of me, Gladys?

3675
03:29:53,160 --> 03:29:53,940
I did it!

3676
03:29:54,480 --> 03:29:56,260
I went up!

3677
03:29:57,380 --> 03:29:58,760
I went up!

3678
03:29:59,580 --> 03:30:00,400
Wait, more missiles?

3679
03:30:00,680 --> 03:30:02,100
Wait, is this a boss fight?

3680
03:30:02,760 --> 03:30:02,860
Wait.

3681
03:30:04,720 --> 03:30:07,820
Wait, oh no.

3682
03:30:08,320 --> 03:30:08,800
Oh no.

3683
03:30:09,020 --> 03:30:09,560
Oh no.

3684
03:30:09,960 --> 03:30:10,320
Oh no.

3685
03:30:10,720 --> 03:30:11,580
Wait, wait, wait.

3686
03:30:11,960 --> 03:30:13,680
That wasn't supposed to happen.

3687
03:30:14,180 --> 03:30:15,960
Do you see that thing that fell out of me?

3688
03:30:16,040 --> 03:30:16,600
What is that?

3689
03:30:16,640 --> 03:30:17,380
Wait, is this really?

3690
03:30:17,380 --> 03:30:17,720
Surprise.

3691
03:30:18,260 --> 03:30:19,320
I've never seen it before.

3692
03:30:19,340 --> 03:30:19,860
Where are you?

3693
03:30:20,100 --> 03:30:20,860
Are you really?

3694
03:30:20,920 --> 03:30:21,480
It's a mystery.

3695
03:30:21,740 --> 03:30:24,920
I'll solve later by myself because you'll be dead.

3696
03:30:24,960 --> 03:30:26,020
Are you the blue guy?

3697
03:30:26,240 --> 03:30:27,400
Where are you taking that thing?

3698
03:30:27,720 --> 03:30:28,540
Okay, but he's purple.

3699
03:30:29,120 --> 03:30:29,700
Where am I taking him?

3700
03:30:29,700 --> 03:30:31,200
I wouldn't bother with that thing.

3701
03:30:31,520 --> 03:30:35,000
My guess is that touching it will just make your life even
worse somehow.

3702
03:30:35,520 --> 03:30:35,520
Okay.

3703
03:30:35,600 --> 03:30:35,600
Okay.

3704
03:30:36,020 --> 03:30:36,440
All right.

3705
03:30:36,660 --> 03:30:37,000
All right.

3706
03:30:37,100 --> 03:30:37,640
What do I do?

3707
03:30:39,720 --> 03:30:43,660
I don't want to tell you your business, but if it were me,
I'd leave that thing alone.

3708
03:30:44,160 --> 03:30:44,460
Oh.

3709
03:30:45,480 --> 03:30:46,100
What's it?

3710
03:30:47,380 --> 03:30:50,840
Do you think I'm trying to trick you with reverse
psychology?

3711
03:30:51,100 --> 03:30:52,220
I mean, seriously.

3712
03:30:55,580 --> 03:30:56,120
Button!

3713
03:30:57,720 --> 03:30:58,200
Button!

3714
03:30:58,200 --> 03:30:58,620
Okay, fine.

3715
03:30:58,940 --> 03:30:59,900
Do touch it.

3716
03:31:00,120 --> 03:31:04,360
Button, get it.

3717
03:31:05,500 --> 03:31:06,320
Let's be honest.

3718
03:31:06,840 --> 03:31:08,740
Neither one of us knows what that thing does.

3719
03:31:08,880 --> 03:31:09,120
Burn.

3720
03:31:09,460 --> 03:31:12,140
Don't put it in the corner and I'll deal with it later.

3721
03:31:15,740 --> 03:31:16,880
Okay, now...

3722
03:31:16,880 --> 03:31:17,100
Okay.

3723
03:31:17,380 --> 03:31:19,160
Probably some kind of raw sewage container.

3724
03:31:19,680 --> 03:31:20,140
Button good.

3725
03:31:20,940 --> 03:31:21,640
Portal, yes.

3726
03:31:23,080 --> 03:31:24,980
All right, button, button.

3727
03:31:25,420 --> 03:31:28,080
Maybe you should marry that thing since you love it so much.

3728
03:31:28,680 --> 03:31:29,820
Do you want to marry it?

3729
03:31:29,920 --> 03:31:30,840
Well, I won't let you.

3730
03:31:31,100 --> 03:31:31,960
How does that feel?

3731
03:31:32,080 --> 03:31:34,160
All right, button, button good.

3732
03:31:36,200 --> 03:31:37,300
Have I lied to you?

3733
03:31:37,600 --> 03:31:38,960
I mean, in this room.

3734
03:31:39,340 --> 03:31:40,560
Trust me, leave that thing alone.

3735
03:31:40,700 --> 03:31:42,200
All right, all right, all right, all right, come on.

3736
03:31:42,260 --> 03:31:43,380
Come on, come on.

3737
03:31:43,560 --> 03:31:45,020
No, no, whoa.

3738
03:31:45,020 --> 03:31:45,820
Really?

3739
03:31:46,780 --> 03:31:48,000
Okay, I just need to line it up.

3740
03:31:49,020 --> 03:31:49,320
Okay.

3741
03:31:50,920 --> 03:31:51,820
Oh, portal!

3742
03:31:53,580 --> 03:31:53,860
Okay.

3743
03:31:56,860 --> 03:31:57,340
Oh, portal!

3744
03:31:57,680 --> 03:31:59,580
Button good, then portal good.

3745
03:32:00,540 --> 03:32:01,100
Portal.

3746
03:32:03,240 --> 03:32:04,440
And then...

3747
03:32:05,720 --> 03:32:07,380
Oh my gosh, I'm so smart.

3748
03:32:07,520 --> 03:32:07,760
I went.

3749
03:32:08,200 --> 03:32:08,980
I'm so smart.

3750
03:32:09,340 --> 03:32:11,960
Button good, and then portal good, and then burn good.

3751
03:32:13,740 --> 03:32:14,340
Okay.

3752
03:32:16,900 --> 03:32:17,040
Okay.

3753
03:32:17,060 --> 03:32:17,660
There.

3754
03:32:19,920 --> 03:32:21,040
Oh my God, I'm still.

3755
03:32:21,660 --> 03:32:23,200
Oh my God, I did it.

3756
03:32:23,440 --> 03:32:24,280
I did it.

3757
03:32:24,280 --> 03:32:30,080
What it does into an aperture science emergency intelligence
incinerator that has got to be the dumbest thing.

3758
03:32:30,100 --> 03:32:32,560
It's negative right now with a single voice in.

3759
03:32:37,530 --> 03:32:40,750
I figured out what that thing you just incinerated.

3760
03:32:41,170 --> 03:32:45,210
It was a morality core they installed after I flooded the
enrichment center.

3761
03:32:45,590 --> 03:32:47,670
I'm back with one human legend, Matt.

3762
03:32:47,730 --> 03:32:48,930
Welcome back, Siri.

3763
03:32:48,930 --> 03:32:53,730
Wait, we're just doing the final, the final, final boss
fight.

3764
03:32:55,930 --> 03:32:58,190
I thought they were, they were, wait, wait, wait.

3765
03:32:58,650 --> 03:33:01,910
Oh, oh, oh my god, oh, wait.

3766
03:33:02,470 --> 03:33:03,010
What's this?

3767
03:33:03,210 --> 03:33:08,770
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

appreciate it.

3770
03:33:18,930 --> 03:33:20,110
Thank you so much!

3771
03:33:20,510 --> 03:33:20,990
What?

3772
03:33:22,710 --> 03:33:22,950
What?

3773
03:33:24,030 --> 03:33:24,790
Hey!

3774
03:33:26,510 --> 03:33:27,050

3776
03:33:28,650 --> 03:33:28,810
Hey!

3777
03:33:31,590 --> 03:33:33,070
Oh, I missed.

3778
03:33:33,450 --> 03:33:33,770
I missed!

3779
03:33:34,190 --> 03:33:34,770
I missed!

3780
03:33:35,170 --> 03:33:36,290
I fucking missed!

3781
03:33:36,670 --> 03:33:37,290
I can't!

3782
03:33:40,090 --> 03:33:43,930
Wait, wait, wait, wait, where is this lead?

3783
03:33:44,530 --> 03:33:44,950
Wait.

3784
03:33:45,730 --> 03:33:48,790
Wait, I missed again!

3785
03:33:49,570 --> 03:33:57,750
Definitely missed Okay, wait wait wait wait is this how do I
keep missing?

3786
03:33:58,110 --> 03:33:59,990
Okay, I'm just gonna go here.

3787
03:34:00,010 --> 03:34:01,130
Okay, all right.

3788
03:34:01,430 --> 03:34:03,530
All right, is this wait where is she?

3789
03:34:04,410 --> 03:34:05,590
Where even is she?

3790
03:34:07,050 --> 03:34:10,910
