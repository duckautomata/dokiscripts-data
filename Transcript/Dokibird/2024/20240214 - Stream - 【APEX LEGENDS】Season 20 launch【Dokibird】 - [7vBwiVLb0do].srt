1
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:53,650
Hello everybody!

2
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:57,130
Hello everyone.

3
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:02,430
We are here for the Season 20 Apex launch.

4
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:07,530
There's a lot of big changes going on here.

5
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:10,010
And despite everything...

6
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:11,730
Sorry, I'm like super rusty.

7
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,730
I haven't played Apex in a long time!

8
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:17,870
Oh my god.

9
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:21,090
But a lot of things have changed for this game.

10
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:28,470
And I'm like, honestly, I'm like really, really excited to actually play the official release of it.

11
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:33,510
Because like, I playtested this release a long time ago.

12
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:38,870
And I can fi- I've been keeping it a secret for a while.

13
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:43,670
So, it's so cool that it's finally out.

14
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:49,030
And for those who are wondering what the biggest change is, like the MOBA shit they did.

15
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:55,930
Where basically, you can- your armor is connected to your upgrades.

16
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:58,090
So you can pick one or the other.

17
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:01,130
So like, I've seen this for a while now.

18
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:07,970
So I'm- so I debated about streaming today.

19
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:12,110
But I've- I just want a game.

20
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:20,490
I just- I didn't obviously, due to the circumstances, I didn't sleep a lot.

21
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:23,970
I think I had like, three hours of sleep.

22
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:27,230
And then I've been- I've been awake for a while now.

23
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:33,230
I was like, uh, do I- do I- do I- do I do?

24
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:41,390
And honestly, gaming has always been like, a huge comfort for me.

25
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:43,930
And especially Apex.

26
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:46,470
Apex is like, one of my biggest comfort games.

27
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:49,610
And like, no matter- oh my go- I'm sorry.

28
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:57,750
No matter what happens, like, I always default to Apex.

29
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:02,070
Because it really- oh my gosh.

30
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:03,810
It has like, helped me a lot.

31
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:05,950
Like, dealing with my emotions.

32
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:10,150
Because I just- especially Apex.

33
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:14,190
Because Apex has always been my ultimate comfort game.

34
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:17,010
Whenever I- I'm sad.

35
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:20,710
Um, Apex has always helped me a lot.

36
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:23,330
Especially if I'm playing Apex with people.

37
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:27,150
Um, and it really helps me a lot.

38
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,270
In general.

39
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:33,830
So, that's why I decided, I was like, I'll stream Apex.

40
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:35,210
And I didn't want to be alone.

41
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:42,710
And I want to say a huge shoutout to all my friends that- stayed up with me last night.

42
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:46,170
Um, making sure I was safe.

43
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:49,150
Um, and all people.

44
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:51,450
Making sure I was safe.

45
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:54,370
Making sure, um, everything was okay.

46
00:05:54,470 --> 00:06:00,830
So I just wanted to say- I can't really, um, say who they are publicly.

47
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:05,250
But I just wanted to say, like, a huge thank you.

48
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:11,350
Um, to all my friends that- stayed up with me last night.

49
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:15,490
And just to make sure I had people, uh, around.

50
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:17,070
So I'd be okay.

51
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:18,230
And everything.

52
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:20,370
And that's why I also wanted to stream today!

53
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:25,410
I wanted to stream because- Um, I didn't really want to be alone.

54
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:27,890
And I've always enjoyed playing Apex.

55
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:30,550
Uh, I always enjoyed playing Apex.

56
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:34,870
And it's- like I said, it's something- Something I've enjoyed doing.

57
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:36,850
And always cheers me up.

58
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:44,150
And for those- Obviously I can't say much about the current situation.

59
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:50,490
Um, because, uh, my lawyer is making sure I'm safe.

60
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:53,370
So, um, I can't really say much.

61
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:56,150
For now, I just wanna- Pew pew!

62
00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:00,190
I have not played Apex in a long time!

63
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:04,010
So, it's gonna be rough.

64
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:07,470
It's gonna be very fucking rough.

65
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:09,590
Obviously.

66
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:13,590
Uh, so, I'm gonna get shit on.

67
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:21,530
Especially when I feel like- There's a lot- Oh shit, there's a lot of people coming back right now.

68
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:24,970
And I feel so rusty at the moment.

69
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:27,030
Um, so yeah.

70
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:29,610
Uh, yeah, anyway.

71
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:33,410
I heard like- Okay, I don't really remember a lot of the upgrades.

72
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:37,170
But this one was like, you can see batteries and stuff.

73
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:38,710
And then increases tactical range.

74
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:42,730
Gain a tactical charge but have shield regen duration.

75
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:43,930
Like, shit like that.

76
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:45,090
Like, that shit.

77
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:48,670
Like, you can't find armors on the ground anymore apparently.

78
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:50,990
Um, so...

79
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:52,830
That- I don't know!

80
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:55,390
I guess like that makes it so it's less lucky.

81
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:57,250
Like, it's less RNG.

82
00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:00,170
So you can't find armor on the ground anymore.

83
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:04,310
And, uh, it's all about like upgrading your armor.

84
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:06,250
Yeah, like shooting your gun.

85
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:08,690
Or like finding like XP boxes.

86
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:13,290
Like these XP boxes and shit that will get you like free upgrade.

87
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:14,790
And stuff like that.

88
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:17,170
Or like abilites or something.

89
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:19,590
It is very- It looks different.

90
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:22,790
Yeah, like this new season is a lot of changes.

91
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:28,530
And apparently rank, it resets everybody to like 0 or 1.

92
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:29,110
Sorry, 1.

93
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:34,390
So every rank starts off at rank 1 or rank 1 point.

94
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:35,790
Sorry, not rank 1.

95
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:38,690
But- But like starts off at rank 1.

96
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:39,510
Like, like So rank 1 is at 1 point.

97
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:45,230
So Preds will be in the same lobby as like Bronze players and shit like that.

98
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:49,130
Which is like, sucks to the Bronze players.

99
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:52,570
And then like, I remember I was telling one of my friends.

100
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:57,070
I was like, I was like, Oh my go- I was like, Oh my god no!

101
00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:03,230
We're gonna- Like, what if we- What if we get in a game with all these Pred players?

102
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:11,590
And then my friend was like, I was like, you do know the percentage of Pred players in the Apex population, right?

103
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:16,030
And I was like, wait... and then they were like, yeah, there's more...

104
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:20,630
There's more gold Plat players playing this game than there are Pred players.

105
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:22,350
You do know that, right?

106
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:25,930
I was like, oh my god, wait!

107
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:31,770
I forgot Pred is 1% of the fucking population!

108
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:37,270
So like... I was like, oh my god, there's real people playing this game.

109
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:41,870
It's been a... you know, after being in like, SPMM lobbies for so long...

110
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:48,450
I forgot there were like, actual people that played this game and not the degen lowlifes like me.

111
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:53,610
I was like, oh my god!

112
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:55,630
There's a dad out there!

113
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:59,710
There's a dad out there who just got home from work!

114
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:01,650
That's booting up his face!

115
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:05,350
He's like, I'm gonna get my favorite Apex Legends game that's like in bronze right now!

116
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:08,250
And then he's gonna get absolutely farmed!

117
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:14,510
I was like, holy shit!

118
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:15,490
They exist!

119
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:25,110
Look, I've been in like, SPMM lobbies for so fucking long now.

120
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:28,430
For those who don't know what SPMM is, it's like...

121
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:30,670
I don't remember the full names.

122
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:32,310
That was something... match...

123
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:33,630
What was it called?

124
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:35,830
Okay, I don't even remember the full name.

125
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:41,090
But it's basically like, matchmaking where you're in the lobby with your skill level.

126
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:44,950
Sorry, my brain's not working when you're going around with three hours of sleep.

127
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:54,950
So I forgot what it's like to play with and against real people and with jobs.

128
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:57,750
Who have like, 9 to 5 jobs.

129
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:01,210
And like, is playing this game as a hobby.

130
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:07,150
And is also not a freak... controller, roller demon freak.

131
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:09,250
I forgot what that is.

132
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:11,950
Like, oh skill based matchmaking, yes.

133
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:13,290
That's what I mean.

134
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:15,350
I forgot that's what it was like.

135
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:18,090
So I was like, holy... but this is only in rank though.

136
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:19,690
Like, I'm gonna be playing some trios.

137
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:20,650
I don't know why I won't play rank.

138
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,230
Because I don't want to get farmed by...

139
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:25,710
I don't want to be the dad that gets farmed by the friend play.

140
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:27,730
And so...

141
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:28,670
And so...

142
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:31,770
So like, I was like, oh... that's... nah.

143
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:39,450
So... we're just gonna do some trios.

144
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:41,010
But yeah, I know there's like...

145
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:42,730
Oh shit, how do I change heroes again?

146
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:43,170
It's been a while.

147
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:43,530
Oh, M.

148
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:45,930
Alright, oh, you can tell how long...

149
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:48,310
When was the last time I've touched this account.

150
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:54,150
I saw like Octane has some cool ones.

151
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:55,310
Did my game crash?

152
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:58,030
Oh, that was a problem.

153
00:11:58,370 --> 00:11:59,170
Whoops.

154
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:00,130
Alright.

155
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:01,310
Huh?

156
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:03,650
Apex?

157
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:04,610
Apex?

158
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:06,430
Are you okay?

159
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:08,130
Hello?

160
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:11,430
Guys, I think I broke Apex.

161
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:12,330
Give me a sec.

162
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:15,170
I think Apex was like, no.

163
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:18,270
You cannot play Octane.

164
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:22,590
Let me force quit this real fast.

165
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:24,810
Alright, so apparently...

166
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:25,290
I'm gonna have to go back to the game.

167
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:28,370
Apex did not like that I tried to play...

168
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:29,590
That I...

169
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:32,390
I tried to play Octane just now.

170
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:34,390
Apex was like, no, no, no.

171
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:37,910
You cannot show the world the Octane stats.

172
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:41,490
Oh my god, how do I get my task manager back here?

173
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:43,210
Task messenger!

174
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:45,750
How do I get you over here?

175
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:47,530
Okay, guys.

176
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:50,350
We have a little situation.

177
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:51,330
Okay, wait.

178
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:52,570
What was the...

179
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:55,270
Guys, what is the thing that force quits again?

180
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:58,270
What was the keyboard shortcut?

181
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:00,790
Guys.

182
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:03,470
Guys, what's the keyboard shortcut?

183
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:06,410
You know when you're like, hey guys, I need tech support.

184
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:08,750
And you always say that thing that never fixes the game.

185
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:09,470
But...

186
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:10,330
Oh, Alt F4.

187
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:10,970
There we go.

188
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:12,270
Alt F...

189
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:14,450
I hope I don't Alt F4 my fucking OBS.

190
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:16,330
That would be very unfortunate.

191
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:22,650
Oh, no, I didn't.

192
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:24,230
But it's not for...

193
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:25,250
Oh my god.

194
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:27,090
How do I fix this?

195
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:28,010
Okay, guys.

196
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:29,070
What is that...

197
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:37,170
What is that shortcut that lets me move my browser to another monitor?

198
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:39,850
Sorry, I need to call tech support real quick.

199
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:43,410
I can't believe picking Octane fucked up my game.

200
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:53,410
What was the thing that makes it so that it'll move to my other monitor?

201
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:54,530
I don't remember.

202
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:58,470
I don't remember what moves my shit to the other monitor.

203
00:13:58,810 --> 00:13:59,330
Alright.

204
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:01,610
Ctrl Alt Shift...

205
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:02,830
Wait, that doesn't sound right.

206
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:04,870
Window Shift Left.

207
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:05,450
Okay.

208
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:06,970
That sounds right.

209
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:07,310
Okay.

210
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:09,290
Window Shift Left.

211
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:10,170
Oh!

212
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:10,950
There we go.

213
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:12,070
Alright.

214
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:13,270
It says not responding.

215
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:13,990
I did it.

216
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:15,390
I force quit Apex.

217
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:16,650
Oh my god.

218
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:21,150
You know, to be fair, the game did just launch.

219
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:24,050
So, like, I ain't gonna blame it.

220
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:25,550
It is...

221
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:27,050
It is launch day.

222
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:32,810
So, I'm not surprised that the game was like, no.

223
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:34,990
Alright.

224
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:35,650
Let's see.

225
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:36,290
Apex.

226
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:37,010
Yay!

227
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:38,490
Alright.

228
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:39,950
I guess we're not even gonna...

229
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:46,630
I guess the game doesn't want me to play Octane even though, like, I heard Octane's powerups were pretty cool.

230
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:47,990
I think I wrote...

231
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:50,870
From what I remember from the playtest, it was...

232
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:53,070
He gets, like, an extra jump or some shit.

233
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:55,250
I don't really remember too much.

234
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:58,190
Alright, so, like, I could play rank.

235
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:01,250
But then, like, I don't really...

236
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:01,870
I don't know.

237
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:03,150
I don't wanna get farmed right now.

238
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:06,230
Cause every fucking pro player out there is playing rank right now.

239
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:09,010
Every fucking streamer and every pro is playing.

240
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:13,930
And, like, I know, like, they're, like, 5% of the player base.

241
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:16,070
But, like, it's still...

242
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:17,390
They're still there.

243
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:25,230
If I get into a lobby where it's filled with, like, bronzes and stuff.

244
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:32,670
Because players... and they're like the only pro team out there, like... they're just gonna run it down and fuck me up.

245
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:39,490
Like... it's... five percent is still five percent of the lobby.

246
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:48,010
Usually, usually they'll just run around killing everybody, and I don't want to be part of... I don't want to be part of their statistic.

247
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:51,990
Alright.

248
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:54,150
I'm pretty sure I'll get the five percent.

249
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:54,530
Yeah.

250
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:56,610
I'm pretty sure...

251
00:15:57,630 --> 00:16:01,390
I'm not really feeling it unless I have a three stack.

252
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:04,710
Oh my god I get to actually show my badges!

253
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:08,810
I haven't seen those badges in forever!

254
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:15,750
Oh my god, I haven't seen those badges in so long.

255
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:17,130
I told you guys!

256
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:19,470
I told you guys I had them!

257
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:21,010
I knew it!

258
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:24,050
I knew I wasn't full of cope.

259
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:27,390
Alright.

260
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:28,930
What is my upgrade?

261
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:31,690
So it takes 25% less stim damage.

262
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:34,270
Where the fuck I'll never get nated!

263
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:35,490
Oh shit.

264
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:36,250
Oh shit.

265
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:36,650
Okay.

266
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:38,970
You can tell the game just came out.

267
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:51,710
Guys guys, no you don't understand this game.

268
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:54,030
This game just came out guys.

269
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,050
You don't understand.

270
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:57,130
I have not played Octane in so long.

271
00:16:57,290 --> 00:16:59,190
I just know like his stuff is like fun.

272
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:00,410
Alright.

273
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:01,470
Zero guns.

274
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:02,150
Oh no.

275
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:02,450
Nice.

276
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:03,750
Okay.

277
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:07,530
Let me like... I always forget to fix my bindings.

278
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:09,130
Did he steal my loot?

279
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:10,750
What the fuck are you doing?

280
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:13,870
Oh shit.

281
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:15,510
I'm fucked.

282
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:17,350
I don't really have the guns right now.

283
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:18,330
Hello.

284
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:21,450
Oh shit!

285
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:22,670
You're not my teammate!

286
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:23,070
Oh!

287
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:23,970
Oh!

288
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:24,250
Oh!

289
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:24,590
Oh!

290
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:25,670
No!

291
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,990
I thought I was my... Oh shit.

292
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:30,770
Sorry.

293
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:32,610
That was... Yikes.

294
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:34,590
I did not... What the fuck?

295
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:37,270
I did not expect like two people to be there.

296
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:39,330
They can play like a team?

297
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:41,850
What do you mean?

298
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:44,570
Where's my team?

299
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:47,910
To be fair I was... What the fuck is wrong with you?

300
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:49,190
I'm already dead!

301
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,070
Oh my god!

302
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:52,730
What the fuck is wrong with you?

303
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:53,730
Leave me alone!

304
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:58,570
Oh my god!

305
00:17:58,590 --> 00:17:59,450
You dog shit!

306
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:01,230
You can't even throw a screen!

307
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:03,190
That's so annoying.

308
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:03,830
That's so boring.

309
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:05,430
Look.

310
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:05,750
Sorry.

311
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:07,170
This was a warm up round.

312
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:08,450
I'm not... You know.

313
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:09,110
I was so...

314
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:10,030
Sorry.

315
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:12,230
That was just... That was just... Look.

316
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:15,870
If he had trouble like trying to kill me while I was already down...

317
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:17,170
That's on him.

318
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:19,130
That's on him.

319
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:20,770
Look.

320
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:21,730
I told you!

321
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:25,050
I'm like the dad that just got home getting farmed!

322
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:29,970
This is why... This is why I don't play... I'm not playing rank right now.

323
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:32,290
I have no idea what I'm doing.

324
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:33,110
It's been too long.

325
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:34,650
Oh this guy knows what he's doing.

326
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:36,470
He knows the climb up.

327
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:39,830
He already knows more than 90% of the player base.

328
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:41,930
Oh.

329
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:42,370
Oh!

330
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:43,830
Movement.

331
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:47,510
Movement right there.

332
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:50,650
Wait!

333
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:51,170
Tony!

334
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:52,510
Where the fuck were you?

335
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:56,210
Why didn't you come and save me earlier?

336
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:58,130
You clearly know what you're doing.

337
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:00,890
But also, why the fuck are you playing Seer?

338
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:02,190
Is Seer OP now?

339
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:07,650
Also, Tony should be the one stream... I'm just... I'm just a Tony POV streamer now.

340
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:10,250
Oh.

341
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,490
No armor swaps.

342
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:11,730
Whoa.

343
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:13,950
Where the fuck am I?

344
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:14,630
No!

345
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:15,310
Pick me up!

346
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:17,830
Pick me up!

347
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:18,870
I'm so helpful!

348
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:21,010
I swear to god I'm Octane.

349
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:23,890
You know I'm useful.

350
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:24,810
No!

351
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:28,010
Stoky bird!

352
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:29,810
No!

353
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:33,390
Well, I don't give a fuck about Tony anymore.

354
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:41,570
There's no... There's no reasons.

355
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:42,470
Oh shit!

356
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:43,710
Gumi, okay.

357
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:45,730
Wait, Gumi, if you're watching...

358
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:49,650
Let me play like five more solos and then I'll come over.

359
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:51,570
I don't know if she's watching.

360
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:53,930
I don't know if she's watching.

361
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:56,530
Alright, what are some... Okay, guys.

362
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:00,370
Tell me who has the best upgrades.

363
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:03,190
Alright, who has the best upgrades, guys?

364
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:05,690
Who is it?

365
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:08,290
I'll just keep her up here.

366
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:10,510
Alright.

367
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:13,950
Tony did not want... Yeah, they did not want to save me.

368
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:16,410
So they don't get the streamer POV now.

369
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:18,330
Who has the best one?

370
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:20,430
Watson?

371
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:23,750
I swear to god it's not... I swear to god it's because...

372
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:26,010
Oh wait, Watson has a thing where like...

373
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:28,670
Did he keep the one where like if you...

374
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:31,290
His like gas canister heals him and shit?

375
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:32,470
Did he keep that?

376
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:33,510
Yeah!

377
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:34,610
Oh wait!

378
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:35,630
Wait, what about Bangalore?

379
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:36,790
There was one more...

380
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:37,170
Yeah!

381
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:39,230
I remember this.

382
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:40,530
That shit was so OP.

383
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:45,350
Basically, if I... If I'm in the Bangalore smoke, I reject...

384
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:47,330
I mean, I'm literally reading what it says.

385
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:50,370
I don't know what I'm... I don't know what I'm telling you guys.

386
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:53,010
You guys can read and like...

387
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:57,410
Yeah, like, you know, there's smoke, my HP comes back.

388
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:58,510
Like...

389
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:07,990
So like... I don't know if they like nerfed it or whatever, but it was so fucking overpowered during the playtest.

390
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:12,290
It was so bad during the playtest.

391
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:19,730
Everyone was just playing... Everyone was just... I remember in the playtest, it was like...

392
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:23,730
They were... My team was like Bangalore, Caustic, and Lifeless.

393
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:23,910
And I was like, I'm gonna die.

394
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:26,210
Or something, because it was so dumb.

395
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:27,470
We just healed each other.

396
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:30,690
We were just self-healing each other non-stop.

397
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:31,410
No!

398
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:33,090
My Bangalore!

399
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:38,850
What the fuck was the point after I fucking bragged about Bangalore?

400
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:44,230
I'll play Pathfinder.

401
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:45,470
Okay, what do we have?

402
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:49,470
Gain access, gain access... Oh shit, Pathfinder's fucking dog shit.

403
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:50,710
He has nothing.

404
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:54,430
Why do I care about like, beacons or whatever?

405
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:01,010
Why do I care about intel?

406
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:03,030
I'm gonna die anyway.

407
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:06,590
Can't believe it.

408
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:08,190
My game crashed.

409
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:09,110
Oh, thank god.

410
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:09,790
I guess...

411
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:12,370
I guess the game...

412
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:19,170
The game was like, you don't wanna play Pathfinder?

413
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:21,730
I guess you don't have to play.

414
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:24,750
Oh my god.

415
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:29,130
Apex is not what I mean!

416
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:31,610
I still wanna play the game!

417
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:35,170
What the fuck, Apex?

418
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:38,930
I still wanna play!

419
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:44,270
The game was like, how dare you.

420
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:46,030
I wonder if I'll still be in the lobby.

421
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:47,430
My poor guy.

422
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:48,650
It's alright.

423
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:49,150
He was chanting.

424
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:49,470
He's a champion.

425
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:50,090
He can survive.

426
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:51,970
I swear to god, if I load in, I'm dead.

427
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:53,270
I s- Oh, thank god.

428
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:55,610
Oh, this is- I don't like being here.

429
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:57,770
Oh wait, I'm still fine.

430
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:02,450
Oh no, I have my fucking heirloom on.

431
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:06,990
Yes, back in the day, I- Sorry about the frames.

432
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:12,310
It's- It's- It gets like that when you log back in.

433
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:13,090
Alright.

434
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:16,030
Yes, back in the day, I used to spend money.

435
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:17,650
Um...

436
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:24,970
And- But Pathfinder heirloom has to be one of the fucking worst heirlooms out there.

437
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:29,350
I've like, realized because it's so fucking...

438
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:29,970
Um...

439
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:33,510
It's just so annoying- Like, it takes up too much of the screen!

440
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:37,010
It just takes up too much of the screen.

441
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:40,070
And hate- I don't like the Pathfinder heirloom.

442
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:42,750
Alright.

443
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:44,090
Alright!

444
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:45,170
Son!

445
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:48,490
You have your fucking regen HP!

446
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:53,010
I follow you because I think you know what you're doing.

447
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:55,970
Where are they?

448
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:58,490
I don't know where they are.

449
00:23:59,130 --> 00:23:59,690
Hello?

450
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:01,470
Oh.

451
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:02,310
Oh, our guy.

452
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:03,590
Our average everyday.

453
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:04,890
You okay?

454
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:06,690
He's over there.

455
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:08,270
Ooh!

456
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:10,790
Nice.

457
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:12,250
That was fast.

458
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:13,650
Poor guy.

459
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:16,310
Yay!

460
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:18,590
You had no friends.

461
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:20,430
Poor guy.

462
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:22,450
He didn't have stun.

463
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:24,190
Cool gloves?

464
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:24,810
Thank you.

465
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:27,570
It's- It takes up 80% of my screen.

466
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:39,890
It takes up- This is why, like- Like, Master plus players don't have their heirlooms out anymore.

467
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:42,250
Oh my god.

468
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:42,670
Wow!

469
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:44,830
I guess- Who cares?

470
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:46,130
I don't need intel.

471
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:48,290
Who the fuck uses intel?

472
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:49,350
What the fuck?

473
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:50,130
Where?

474
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:51,830
Where?

475
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:54,210
Oh shit!

476
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:55,230
Oh shit!

477
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:56,090
Okay, there he is.

478
00:24:56,810 --> 00:24:58,010
I didn't know he was there.

479
00:24:58,170 --> 00:24:58,690
Wait, what?

480
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:01,570
Did he come downstairs?

481
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:02,610
Where is he?

482
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:05,850
Where is he?

483
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:06,390
Wait, what?

484
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:11,070
I- Oh god, I'm dying, deadslid.

485
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:14,810
Where is he?

486
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:16,190
Where the fuck are these people?

487
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:18,430
Oh!

488
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:20,590
It's okay, I killed a TTV-er.

489
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:22,470
Come on, stun!

490
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:23,070
Reach in!

491
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:25,470
Reach in and you're sm- Oh, he's dead.

492
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:36,050
Look, I swear, I- All I'm saying is that if I was on Bangalore, I would've lived.

493
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:38,010
I would've fucking lived.

494
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:42,670
Okay, all I'm gonna say is that as a streamer, I blamed my heirloom.

495
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:47,610
I feel like I should unlock all these guys real quick.

496
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:48,170
Let me...

497
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:49,410
I don't unlock again.

498
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:50,490
It's been so long.

499
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:51,790
I don't want to...

500
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:55,670
I don't want to unlock...

501
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:58,690
I don't want to unlock characters.

502
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:00,050
Guys!

503
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:02,690
Where the fuck is the unlock button?

504
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:04,970
There's a bio now?

505
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:06,410
There's lore?

506
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:09,030
Okay, that's too much to read.

507
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:11,030
I can't...

508
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:15,130
Guys, it's been too long!

509
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:17,590
Money?

510
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:20,930
There's no way it's money now.

511
00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:26,810
Even I can't unlock him anymore?

512
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:28,790
Oh, right...

513
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:29,790
Oh my god.

514
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:30,890
Wait, no?

515
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:32,870
What the fuck happened?

516
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:34,750
It used to be so simple!

517
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:40,770
Unlocking characters used to be so simple.

518
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:46,530
When did it get so difficult for all the dads out there?

519
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:49,830
You have to buy the buy button?

520
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:53,050
Oh my gosh, there he is.

521
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:55,210
Wait, do I not have Fuse?

522
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:58,030
Why is it locked?

523
00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:01,050
Oh, challenge is coming soon!

524
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:02,590
I'm so stupid.

525
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:04,450
Sorry, I can't...

526
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:04,890
I don't...

527
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:06,610
I can't see.

528
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:10,750
I was like, why is it locked?

529
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:12,430
I was like, I thought I bought Fuse.

530
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:13,710
Like 20 years ago.

531
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:15,390
I already have...

532
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:15,830
Sorry.

533
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:18,250
I'm a stupid dad.

534
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:19,350
I'm sorry.

535
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:20,270
I told you.

536
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:20,850
It's been...

537
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:23,850
It's been so long since I've touched...

538
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:26,070
Since I've touched Apex.

539
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:27,770
Alright, now.

540
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:28,930
Don't worry, guys.

541
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:30,710
It's not...

542
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:32,570
It's always a warm up until I win.

543
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:34,970
I told you!

544
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:36,430
I told you!

545
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:38,370
Donkey can't read.

546
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:40,350
Donkey can't read.

547
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:45,180
Alright, here we go.

548
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:48,760
Cat, this is what I have you guys for!

549
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,340
You guys are supposed to backseat me.

550
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,340
What the fuck?

551
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,580
You guys had one fucking job.

552
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,280
Alright, this time.

553
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,080
Okay, okay, this...

554
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:07,300
Why would I get to play fucking Rengar?

555
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,620
I don't wanna play Pathfinder!

556
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:14,480
But also, please don't crash my game again, Apex.

557
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,000
Please don't do it.

558
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:20,240
I can't believe it.

559
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,340
I wasn't paying attention.

560
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,920
Holy shit, it's so hot in my room.

561
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:26,880
Let me open the window real quick.

562
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:43,470
Holy shit, it's so hot in my room.

563
00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:45,350
Alright, I'm back.

564
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:48,750
Are we always going to Fragment again?

565
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:50,210
Guys!

566
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:52,530
Guys, come on!

567
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:58,110
I would love to go Fragment, but I'm on Pathfinder.

568
00:28:58,190 --> 00:29:00,390
Oh my god, I actually have like, trails...

569
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:04,150
Like, not trails, but like the animation and shit.

570
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:05,750
Oh my god!

571
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:07,890
Please tell me I'll find a gun.

572
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:10,510
Because I think I fucked up.

573
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:12,270
Oh!

574
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:15,890
Guys, do you guys have a gun?

575
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:17,910
I'll punch him!

576
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:21,090
Okay, I'm gonna leave.

577
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:23,870
I don't think I have a gun.

578
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:24,110
Oh!

579
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:25,630
Wait, there's nobody here.

580
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:26,090
Whoa!

581
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:29,430
Is there guns anywhere?

582
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:31,410
Whoa!

583
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:33,690
Guys!

584
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:35,870
Guys!

585
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:37,570
Oh, wait, he's 20.

586
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:43,270
Oh!

587
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:46,470
There's a lot of people here.

588
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:48,290
I'm just...

589
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:50,530
I'm just gonna go down here for a little bit.

590
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:51,670
Whoa!

591
00:29:52,010 --> 00:29:52,830
Hey guys!

592
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:55,290
Oh my god!

593
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:56,850
Just chill a little bit.

594
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:57,810
Gun?

595
00:29:58,950 --> 00:29:59,510
Nice.

596
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:01,010
Okay.

597
00:30:03,090 --> 00:30:06,110
Sorry, I had to go through finding one singular gun.

598
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:07,050
Hello?

599
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:08,390
Anybody here?

600
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:09,970
Alright, nope.

601
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:13,210
Where the fuck is everybody?

602
00:30:15,410 --> 00:30:16,630
It's okay, I found a gun.

603
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:18,090
My one gun.

604
00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:18,730
Whoa!

605
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:20,390
Hello?

606
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:22,390
Oh my gosh.

607
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:23,650
Where are you?

608
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:24,910
Hello?

609
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:26,850
Where the fuck are you?

610
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:27,190
Where the fuck are people?

611
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:32,090
From like 500 people to zero?

612
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:34,170
This is add up.

613
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:36,250
Oh, oh, I hear him.

614
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:37,170
Hello?

615
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:39,890
Cracked him.

616
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:41,810
Hello?

617
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:44,350
Oh, fuck, I'm stunned.

618
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:44,710
No!

619
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:46,950
Please, it's one guy!

620
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:49,770
There's no way you get fucked over by one...

621
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:50,330
Okay, there you go.

622
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:53,410
Okay.

623
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:54,950
It's okay.

624
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:57,830
We didn't get fucked over by one guy.

625
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:58,670
Oh, thank God.

626
00:30:58,710 --> 00:30:59,730
Wait, there's regen now?

627
00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:01,270
Oh my God, nice.

628
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:03,430
Okay, I got that.

629
00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:04,910
My core in.

630
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:08,510
I almost jumped into that.

631
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:09,650
It's okay.

632
00:31:09,890 --> 00:31:10,850
I'm slowly...

633
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:17,590
I won't say waking up, because I've been awake for a long time, but my eyes are not blurring together now.

634
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:20,310
Oh, thank God.

635
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:23,090
None of these matter.

636
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:24,930
I don't want Pathfinder's life.

637
00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:26,010
This is like the shittiest upgrade.

638
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:26,830
Like, who...

639
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:28,390
I'm not playing Reign.

640
00:31:30,530 --> 00:31:31,230
All right.

641
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:32,790
Oh, wait, zero bullets.

642
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:33,850
That's all right.

643
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:35,970
I never needed my Mastiff, I guess.

644
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:37,450
Did I sleep?

645
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:38,770
That's a good question.

646
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:41,250
I can say that I slept three hours.

647
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:43,310
What the fuck are you doing, Bangalore?

648
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:44,810
You had regen.

649
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:47,370
Oh, poor guy.

650
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:50,210
Oh, he had regen, too.

651
00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:53,190
Where is he?

652
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:54,830
Wait, he's double regening.

653
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:54,910
Oh, he's double regening.

654
00:31:54,910 --> 00:31:55,530
That's illegal.

655
00:31:57,090 --> 00:31:57,570
Wait.

656
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:01,230
Oh, fuck.

657
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:06,190
I don't know where the fuck he is, but he's just regening.

658
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:07,550
There we go.

659
00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:09,410
No, he's dead!

660
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:12,410
Stop!

661
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:13,270
He's dead!

662
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:16,350
Now I'm fucking stunned.

663
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:19,170
Okay.

664
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:20,450
Where is...

665
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:21,870
Oh, wait, they already rez'd.

666
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:22,510
Fuck, okay.

667
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:24,070
Where do I go?

668
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:24,890
Oh, I'm stuck.

669
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:27,530
What is that?

670
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:28,290
King?

671
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:29,330
Evil Harvester?

672
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:31,810
What is...

673
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:34,850
Where are these fancy buttons on my map?

674
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:36,210
Alright.

675
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:38,270
Wait.

676
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:41,410
Where the fuck is the...

677
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:42,330
That's energy.

678
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:43,690
Okay.

679
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:48,050
I'm just like, where are all these fancy icons on my map?

680
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:49,330
And I'm so confused.

681
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:52,450
Everyone's playing Seer.

682
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:54,790
I wonder what Seer has.

683
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:55,970
Guys, that's like so good.

684
00:32:58,490 --> 00:32:59,250
Yay.

685
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:03,090
Oh, I could've...

686
00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:04,430
Same though...

687
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:05,090
Wait!

688
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:06,250
What?

689
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:13,570
Do I know you?

690
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:19,670
What?

691
00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:21,990
Oh, shit!

692
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:23,610
This is your fault, Miko!

693
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:24,490
Oh, my god.

694
00:33:24,490 --> 00:33:24,870
Why are you...

695
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:27,170
Niko you fucking... I swear to god!

696
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:33,110
Niko you bitch!

697
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:36,570
Oh shit.

698
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:41,150
Okay I would help you but like... I'm scared.

699
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:43,270
What does he mean?

700
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:45,450
What does he mean?

701
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:52,250
The most interesting part is that he said from four years ago.

702
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:52,530
Niko!

703
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:54,730
It's like...

704
00:33:55,810 --> 00:33:57,130
Oh my god!

705
00:33:58,130 --> 00:33:59,290
That's like OG!

706
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:01,830
Who the fuck is he?

707
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:04,590
Ah fuck.

708
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:05,790
I'm dead.

709
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:09,030
Doesn't matter I'm dead.

710
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:10,590
Please cover me.

711
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:15,390
Please I'm just a harmless Pathfinder.

712
00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:18,330
Okay.

713
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:20,910
Okay.

714
00:34:23,170 --> 00:34:24,190
I'm okay.

715
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:24,370
I'm okay.

716
00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:28,410
He's not even a Dragoon cause he literally said from four years ago!

717
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:31,990
That's when you're like super... Oh fuck.

718
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:36,870
That's when you know you're super OG.

719
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:39,010
I swear to god.

720
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:42,950
Okay.

721
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:44,330
Are you please...

722
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:45,590
Please stop.

723
00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:48,050
Please stop.

724
00:34:48,910 --> 00:34:50,570
I haven't shot my gun.

725
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:54,630
Please.

726
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:56,350
Man I wish I can regen and smoke.

727
00:34:59,310 --> 00:34:59,830
Alright.

728
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:01,310
I need HP though.

729
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,600
Oh my god I have no scope for this.

730
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:07,920
Please.

731
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:10,260
Please I'm begging you.

732
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,140
Give me anything.

733
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:16,580
Alright we gotta help Niko.

734
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:18,920
Niko we're coming over.

735
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:20,760
Don't worry.

736
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,460
Where is he?

737
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,180
Oh my god, I cannot... this fucking scope sucks.

738
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,460
I forgot how fucking shitty it is.

739
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:36,020
So... do iron sight path... I'm gonna thirst him.

740
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:42,220
Iron sight fucking flatline is so hard.

741
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:45,340
I don't want to grapple because I can see there's a pathfinder on the right.

742
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,140
Fuck it.

743
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:47,700
What's gonna happen?

744
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:48,280
Me dying?

745
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,260
Oh shit!

746
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:49,940
Okay, it's fine.

747
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:52,840
That's fine.

748
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:53,880
That's fine.

749
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:54,620
Oh, that's fine.

750
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:55,440
Please thirst him.

751
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:56,960
For the sake of my HP.

752
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,080
Oh, why did you thirst him?

753
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:03,270
No, I wanted an armor swap!

754
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:05,710
No!

755
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:10,090
Why?

756
00:36:10,090 --> 00:36:13,130
I wanted a fucking armor swap.

757
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:14,150
Please!

758
00:36:16,610 --> 00:36:18,070
Please, they're coming!

759
00:36:19,370 --> 00:36:20,050
No!

760
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:24,090
Okay.

761
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:26,910
There's no way he knows I'm here healing.

762
00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:28,650
There's no fucking way.

763
00:36:28,810 --> 00:36:31,230
They'll kill my teammates first before they kill me and that's okay.

764
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:34,030
That's the risk I'm willing to take.

765
00:36:35,930 --> 00:36:36,870
Oh, thank god.

766
00:36:36,930 --> 00:36:40,590
There's like actual... there's a fucking scope now.

767
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:42,890
Alright.

768
00:36:42,890 --> 00:36:43,370
Nice.

769
00:36:44,050 --> 00:36:44,990
Alright, let's see.

770
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:45,730
What can I do?

771
00:36:45,810 --> 00:36:47,690
Take 25% less damage.

772
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:49,110
Grapple cooldown.

773
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:52,490
I mean, that seems like the only good thing from pathfinder.

774
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:53,230
Haha.

775
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:56,670
That seems like... the other one sucks.

776
00:36:57,330 --> 00:37:02,150
When will I ever need to use my Ziff and like not take damage?

777
00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:03,930
Alright.

778
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:04,390
Nice.

779
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:06,050
Oh hey, he is.

780
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:07,590
That's what I like to see.

781
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:09,910
Who the fuck is Nico?

782
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:13,650
I like how he never even told me who he is.

783
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:15,150
I'm just like, who?

784
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:16,910
Who are you?

785
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:19,890
Have I played with this guy before?

786
00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:22,170
Great.

787
00:37:22,330 --> 00:37:22,870
All ready.

788
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:24,530
A sacrifice I'm... exactly.

789
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:27,350
As long as the streamer is alive.

790
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:29,110
They get to, you know...

791
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:37,650
Little Niko there gets a little bit of the... the high life, you know?

792
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:40,170
They need me alive.

793
00:37:41,330 --> 00:37:43,170
They need the streamer cam.

794
00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:46,630
Oh my god, it's THE Niko.

795
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,990
You guys don't even know who he is.

796
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:52,310
The only reason why you're cheering for him...

797
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:52,750
...is because...

798
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:54,190
Does he like recognize me?

799
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:56,790
So you can self-insert yourself in him.

800
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,340
Where the fuck are people?

801
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,640
Oh my god, there's five squads left?

802
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:09,980
Like how he's never... did he say anything?

803
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:14,600
He hasn't even... he's never responded!

804
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,460
There's nobody here.

805
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:20,340
I feel like we have to go to the zone and... oh wait.

806
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:21,220
No!

807
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:24,720
That's an Eva 8?

808
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:25,860
Really?

809
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:28,640
Come on guys, we gotta go.

810
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,400
But I don't want to be the first one over.

811
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:32,100
Oh.

812
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:32,800
Wait, what?

813
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:34,760
Huh?

814
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,560
Oh, it's over there.

815
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:38,100
Alright.

816
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:39,640
Let's go.

817
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:42,140
No!

818
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,660
I couldn't get the Eva 8.

819
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:47,480
Alright.

820
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,600
Where the fuck are they?

821
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,320
Oh shit, there they are.

822
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:51,200
I feel like I'm gonna die.

823
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:51,700
I'm gonna die from this.

824
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:54,220
Nico, go in.

825
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,340
Die for me.

826
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,740
Die for Joe Keeberg from four years ago.

827
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:02,280
Wait, where are they?

828
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:03,140
Oh.

829
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:05,420
Okay.

830
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:08,860
Alright.

831
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,000
Okay.

832
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:11,400
Okay.

833
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:14,060
Oh.

834
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:16,160
I mean, okay.

835
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:18,940
There's no way he went for me!

836
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:19,980
What?

837
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:22,020
That's fucking crazy!

838
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:27,660
I was like, you're gonna peek that still?

839
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,780
I did not expect him to come back.

840
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:35,920
I didn't expect that.

841
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:41,160
I thought he would, you know... I thought after your one HP, you know, you're like, maybe I should heal.

842
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:47,340
I can't believe he came back for me.

843
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:48,660
It's okay.

844
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:50,660
We have Nico.

845
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:52,000
From four years ago.

846
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,540
Nico collab!

847
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:57,440
I wonder if Nico's like on my fucking friends list.

848
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:58,780
I like played...

849
00:39:58,780 --> 00:39:58,980
Whoa!

850
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:00,560
Oh shit!

851
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:01,160
Nico!

852
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:04,140
Thank you.

853
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:05,480
Thank you.

854
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:07,240
Alright.

855
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:07,880
Nice.

856
00:40:09,430 --> 00:40:11,420
Oh my god, it's the fireball.

857
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:13,960
The fireball is scary.

858
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,120
Oh shit, Nico did it.

859
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,180
Oh my god, Nico!

860
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:18,220
He... what?

861
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:20,500
He killed everybody.

862
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:27,660
I like added so many people on this account as long as they're fucking cracked.

863
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:29,300
I was like, yes.

864
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,480
Nico's got me.

865
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,120
Oh my god, Nico!

866
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:37,820
Nico!

867
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:39,440
Thank you.

868
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:41,760
Nico's got me again.

869
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:45,520
Oh my god, I can win by doing absolutely nothing.

870
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,340
Watch this.

871
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,100
Nico, go!

872
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,740
He's like a Pokemon.

873
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,360
Go, Nico!

874
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:56,140
Oh shit, maybe I should help Nico though.

875
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:00,680
Hello.

876
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,680
Oh my god, whoops!

877
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:04,360
Whoa!

878
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,140
Wait, there's a teammate right here that's helping me.

879
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:13,000
Guys, he's so low, I swear to god!

880
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:13,780
No!

881
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:14,500
Shoot him!

882
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:16,060
He's literally right there!

883
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:18,200
It's so easy to shoot!

884
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,280
What the fuck is loot dispenser?

885
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:23,860
Okay, bye.

886
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:28,100
No!

887
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:31,520
Loot dispenser, help him!

888
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:40,140
Guys, I think... I don't think Nico's gonna get this.

889
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:42,960
Wait, unless...

890
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:43,580
No!

891
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,480
They're so close!

892
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:51,600
Okay, that was my fault.

893
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:53,380
I fucking aggroed so hard.

894
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,300
I was like...

895
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,500
I was...

896
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:58,360
I'm sorry.

897
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:01,280
I got a little bit too excited.

898
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:04,820
I forgot I was supposed to not do anything.

899
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:06,260
That was...

900
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:07,660
That was my bad.

901
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,680
That was my bad.

902
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:13,400
I was like, oh yeah.

903
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,860
I was like, wait, maybe I can shoot my gun.

904
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:17,780
And...

905
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:19,000
And that was my bad.

906
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:19,500
I forgot.

907
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:22,380
I forgot I was supposed to let other people shoot for me.

908
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,240
Oh my god.

909
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:30,240
But also, what the fuck was loot dispenser doing?

910
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,320
Where was he?

911
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:34,240
Where was he?

912
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:37,320
How could this happen to Nico from four years ago?

913
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:38,340
Okay, let me...

914
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:39,580
Actually, I'm curious.

915
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,560
Do I actually have Nico on my friends list?

916
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:44,060
Let's see.

917
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:46,840
Okay, Nico.

918
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:47,560
No, I do not.

919
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:48,560
All right.

920
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:48,920
Okay.

921
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:50,560
I don't know who the fuck Nico is.

922
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:51,220
But I...

923
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:54,520
I have...

924
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:57,960
I've noted who Nico is, but he is not in my friends list.

925
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,040
All right.

926
00:42:59,080 --> 00:42:59,620
At least...

927
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:00,740
At least that I know.

928
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:02,160
Who the fuck is he?

929
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:05,060
Apparently, he's from four years ago.

930
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:06,420
But who?

931
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:08,940
Truly a mystery.

932
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:10,220
I can't add him.

933
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:11,100
It doesn't show.

934
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:14,480
He has the thing where he doesn't want randoms to add him.

935
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:16,820
He doesn't want like chitters like me to add him.

936
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:16,900
What is he?

937
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:18,720
He's in this guy's...

938
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:24,820
All right.

939
00:43:27,950 --> 00:43:28,910
Sorry, I didn't...

940
00:43:28,910 --> 00:43:34,170
My audio check guy was like, hey, you can turn down your game volume a little bit.

941
00:43:34,550 --> 00:43:35,210
All right.

942
00:43:35,490 --> 00:43:38,710
This is the last game we're going to invite Gumio over to play.

943
00:43:39,210 --> 00:43:40,590
I just wanted to explore.

944
00:43:40,790 --> 00:43:41,270
Manio?

945
00:43:41,810 --> 00:43:43,210
Oh my God, Rafe.

946
00:43:43,990 --> 00:43:44,950
He's alleged...

947
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:46,370
He's Nico from four years...

948
00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:46,630
He's...

949
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:49,290
He appears once every four years.

950
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:53,830
I'll never see him again.

951
00:43:54,210 --> 00:43:58,010
The only time we can ever see Nico from four years ago...

952
00:43:58,010 --> 00:44:00,130
is to wait another four years.

953
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:04,330
We will never forget you, Nico.

954
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:08,070
Until we meet again in four years.

955
00:44:09,090 --> 00:44:10,930
Until we mark this calendar.

956
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:12,890
2028.

957
00:44:13,890 --> 00:44:16,010
Whatever date it is today.

958
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:18,190
We will meet Nico again.

959
00:44:20,770 --> 00:44:23,090
Best if he's Nico from GTA.

960
00:44:27,850 --> 00:44:29,290
Alright, here we go.

961
00:44:29,550 --> 00:44:30,590
Oh shit, TikTok.

962
00:44:32,610 --> 00:44:34,950
Okay guys, I'll tell you guys...

963
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:36,690
I was gonna like...

964
00:44:37,790 --> 00:44:40,110
save... I was gonna reveal it later.

965
00:44:40,770 --> 00:44:42,950
But you guys know how I got a play button?

966
00:44:43,390 --> 00:44:45,630
So like, apparently you could put...

967
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:46,530
any name.

968
00:44:46,630 --> 00:44:47,250
on there.

969
00:44:52,390 --> 00:44:55,490
You can put any name on the play button.

970
00:44:55,850 --> 00:44:56,990
So I put...

971
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:58,630
Doki Bird...

972
00:44:58,630 --> 00:45:00,610
FPS V2.

973
00:45:00,810 --> 00:45:02,430
But it's...

974
00:45:02,430 --> 00:45:02,890
Fuck.

975
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:08,430
You can put any...

976
00:45:08,430 --> 00:45:09,410
Oh shit!

977
00:45:09,590 --> 00:45:09,970
Okay.

978
00:45:10,170 --> 00:45:10,910
Please!

979
00:45:11,410 --> 00:45:12,170
Leave me!

980
00:45:13,890 --> 00:45:14,950
Oh my...

981
00:45:14,950 --> 00:45:16,250
I swear to God.

982
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:17,570
Give me one gun.

983
00:45:17,890 --> 00:45:19,150
I swear...

984
00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:21,350
I swear to God.

985
00:45:21,470 --> 00:45:23,590
I just want one gun.

986
00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:25,070
Okay.

987
00:45:25,630 --> 00:45:26,310
Gun?

988
00:45:26,610 --> 00:45:27,650
Oh, thank God.

989
00:45:28,810 --> 00:45:29,490
Nice.

990
00:45:29,510 --> 00:45:30,210
Okay, I got a gun.

991
00:45:34,970 --> 00:45:35,870
Oh my God.

992
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:36,510
Mario!

993
00:45:37,130 --> 00:45:37,810
Where?

994
00:45:38,770 --> 00:45:40,170
Oh my God.

995
00:45:40,250 --> 00:45:41,050
Holy shit.

996
00:45:41,370 --> 00:45:42,050
Castrape.

997
00:45:43,450 --> 00:45:44,130
Woo!

998
00:45:46,970 --> 00:45:48,390
Oh, they're everywhere!

999
00:45:48,890 --> 00:45:49,870
They're everywhere!

1000
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:51,490
Alright.

1001
00:45:51,690 --> 00:45:53,810
I didn't realize there were three people there.

1002
00:45:54,390 --> 00:45:55,270
Alright, anyway.

1003
00:45:55,550 --> 00:45:55,970
Sorry.

1004
00:45:56,110 --> 00:45:56,890
That was...

1005
00:45:56,890 --> 00:45:57,730
That was unlucky.

1006
00:45:57,950 --> 00:45:59,750
Look, if I had a gun...

1007
00:46:00,270 --> 00:46:01,490
Okay, Goomy, one more game.

1008
00:46:01,690 --> 00:46:03,110
One more game, Goomy.

1009
00:46:04,790 --> 00:46:05,810
One more game.

1010
00:46:07,730 --> 00:46:09,530
Look, it's because we had Mario.

1011
00:46:10,650 --> 00:46:11,130
Alright.

1012
00:46:11,390 --> 00:46:13,190
Oh, hey, it's this TikTok guy!

1013
00:46:13,470 --> 00:46:14,730
It's TikTok guy again.

1014
00:46:15,710 --> 00:46:18,670
Look, it's because, like, I just didn't have a gun.

1015
00:46:18,930 --> 00:46:19,950
What can I say?

1016
00:46:20,230 --> 00:46:20,930
Is he that...

1017
00:46:20,930 --> 00:46:21,270
I don't know.

1018
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:21,850
It's actually OP.

1019
00:46:22,410 --> 00:46:23,610
What the fuck does Seer have?

1020
00:46:23,790 --> 00:46:24,750
Increased Passive...

1021
00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:25,370
Faster Movement...

1022
00:46:26,210 --> 00:46:27,190
Wait, I wanna know.

1023
00:46:28,350 --> 00:46:29,910
Increased Throw Range...

1024
00:46:29,910 --> 00:46:32,070
Increased Tactical Scan...

1025
00:46:32,070 --> 00:46:33,270
I mean, that's alright.

1026
00:46:33,510 --> 00:46:34,810
Is it really that OP?

1027
00:46:35,070 --> 00:46:35,710
Wait, is that Niko?

1028
00:46:36,110 --> 00:46:36,810
No, okay.

1029
00:46:37,030 --> 00:46:37,730
God damn it.

1030
00:46:37,870 --> 00:46:39,510
I thought you guys actually baited me.

1031
00:46:39,550 --> 00:46:42,950
I was like, did I actually forgot how to read and missed out on Niko?

1032
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:46,820
Oh my God.

1033
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:47,360
Happy Tree.

1034
00:46:47,860 --> 00:46:52,040
He has a TSM banner and he has a 4K Damage Badge.

1035
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:52,620
Oh my God.

1036
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:54,060
God, I hope he's controller too.

1037
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:03,380
To be fair, they, like, nerfed controller players hard by taking up all... taking all the configs out.

1038
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:04,880
Thank fucking God.

1039
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:18,180
The moment they banned all configs, like, it was, like, so noticeable when, like, games suddenly got, like, incredibly easier because, like, all the controller players didn't have movement anymore.

1040
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:22,620
It actually got so much easier.

1041
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:23,940
Much easier to play.

1042
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:28,680
Thank fucking God.

1043
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:31,580
It's crazy though.

1044
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:35,700
See in that video about all the configs people can use on Roller?

1045
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:37,360
It's actually crazy.

1046
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:41,280
Where's Niko?

1047
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:41,960
He's dead!

1048
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:46,260
Oh fuck.

1049
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:46,900
Okay, there's a gun.

1050
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:50,200
Did Doki get a gun?

1051
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:52,480
I did!

1052
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:54,360
Nice.

1053
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:56,720
Doki got a gun.

1054
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:00,560
Whoa!

1055
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:02,160
Again already?

1056
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:04,620
What?

1057
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:06,300
Where are they?

1058
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:10,140
Where are they?

1059
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:12,740
He got shot at but where?

1060
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:15,900
Where?

1061
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:19,580
Where?

1062
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:21,380
I swear to...

1063
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:22,600
Everybody is everywhere!

1064
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:23,800
Everywhere but near me.

1065
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:26,300
Oh, there!

1066
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:32,100
I heard like...

1067
00:48:32,820 --> 00:48:35,120
I heard a watch that's near me.

1068
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:37,860
So I'm gonna slowly heal up in my smoke.

1069
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:39,780
Yay, self-heal!

1070
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:43,520
Where?

1071
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:46,500
Oh, Seer, please!

1072
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:47,100
Seer!

1073
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:47,780
Seer!

1074
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:50,520
It's fine.

1075
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:50,920
We're fine.

1076
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:55,380
We got help!

1077
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:57,480
We gotta help him!

1078
00:48:58,120 --> 00:48:58,600
Nice.

1079
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:02,020
I'm gonna take that armor swap real fast.

1080
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:04,860
Oh no!

1081
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:09,200
I swear to god, I'm forever lost in this area.

1082
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:10,840
Oh, new team?

1083
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:12,960
Woo!

1084
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:14,620
New team.

1085
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:17,560
Let me block this real fast.

1086
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:19,880
No, Happy Tree!

1087
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:21,420
Don't worry, I got you!

1088
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:23,600
There's no Waze coming over!

1089
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:26,720
There's literally a nade!

1090
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:29,420
It's okay.

1091
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:32,100
Please, Seer, come closer.

1092
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:32,960
Seer!

1093
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:34,640
Crawl to me!

1094
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:36,260
Okay, it's fine.

1095
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:38,040
I didn't need you to crawl to me anyway.

1096
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:38,500
Woo!

1097
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:43,180
Okay.

1098
00:49:43,620 --> 00:49:44,100
Alright.

1099
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:47,180
How the fuck did he have... Woo!

1100
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:50,560
Are you serious?

1101
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:52,360
How did he have all...

1102
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:53,920
I didn't have all!

1103
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:57,980
Oh my god.

1104
00:49:58,940 --> 00:49:59,300
Alright.

1105
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:01,260
Wait, he was... Oh yeah, cause he had all.

1106
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:02,020
I was gonna be like, what?

1107
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:03,480
I didn't even get his arm?

1108
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:04,560
I didn't even get his HP?

1109
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:06,540
Alright.

1110
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:06,900
Okay.

1111
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:08,140
Now.

1112
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:11,260
Now we can do it.

1113
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:12,320
Alright, let me call Goomy.

1114
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:14,840
Let me call Goomy.

1115
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:17,300
Shit, Nico!

1116
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:19,480
Shit, okay, who the f...

1117
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:20,220
Hey.

1118
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:24,180
Why are you screaming?

1119
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:29,240
Cause I got... I got... I got Nico from four years ago joining us.

1120
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:30,760
What the fuck, CookieBurn?

1121
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:31,840
I don't know who he is.

1122
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,160
I don't know who he is.

1123
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:35,520
Dude.

1124
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:40,180
I just kept hearing you say, who the fuck is this dude?

1125
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:41,640
But I'm playing CookieBurn on the side.

1126
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:43,820
He's like the legend!

1127
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:45,980
He's the legend, Nico!

1128
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:48,460
Alright, invite me and I'll invite Nico.

1129
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:50,420
I think he'll...

1130
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:51,620
I'm not here making shit up, I'll be honest.

1131
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:52,980
No, no, I swear to God.

1132
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:54,480
Okay, okay, where is he?

1133
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:57,020
I'm pretty sure he'll ditch his game for us.

1134
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:58,200
I'm pretty sure.

1135
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,400
Wait, where the fuck is he?

1136
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:02,120
He's not even in my...

1137
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:04,500
Wait, did he log off?

1138
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:05,440
He doesn't exist.

1139
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:06,340
He doesn't exist.

1140
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:07,260
He's not real.

1141
00:51:07,580 --> 00:51:08,020
I swear!

1142
00:51:08,020 --> 00:51:08,620
He's not real.

1143
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:09,560
Get out of here.

1144
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:11,940
I swear to God I... There he is, Nico!

1145
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:13,100
Okay, alright, alright.

1146
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:15,740
Alright, I'm gonna see if he'll ditch his game for us.

1147
00:51:16,020 --> 00:51:16,460
Alright.

1148
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:18,240
I think he'll ditch.

1149
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:21,780
I invited him.

1150
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:27,360
If he's like a true... a true homie, he'll ditch his game for us.

1151
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:29,680
Oh my God!

1152
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:31,580
Where the fuck is he?

1153
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:34,320
Wait, who are you?

1154
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:43,720
From 4E.

1155
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:47,480
Who is this guy?

1156
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:49,340
Bro, but he's crack though.

1157
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:51,600
Who are you?

1158
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:53,720
Nico from 4E?

1159
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:55,200
We played in season 3.

1160
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:56,540
Oh shit.

1161
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:59,820
Nico from 4 years ago.

1162
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:05,420
He's making shit up.

1163
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:06,720
He's like, yeah, I went to your high school.

1164
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:07,980
Bro, no!

1165
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:08,340
Okay.

1166
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:11,280
Oh shit, I started... whoops, I forgot.

1167
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:12,920
Sounds fun.

1168
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:15,820
No, Doders, no way.

1169
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:19,160
Oh, wait, I accidentally toggled.

1170
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:22,240
I'm sorry, I can't stop my emotions right now.

1171
00:52:22,420 --> 00:52:22,560
You toggled what?

1172
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:24,860
I can't stop my emotions.

1173
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:31,260
I'm trying to reset my emotions right now.

1174
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:31,880
Oh!

1175
00:52:34,220 --> 00:52:35,420
What was this?

1176
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:36,380
Oh, okay, I got it.

1177
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:36,840
Sorry.

1178
00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:39,580
I don't want to be Choke Master.

1179
00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:40,680
It's okay, Nico.

1180
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:42,360
Nico will be... God damn it!

1181
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,040
This is why we invited you, Nico!

1182
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:45,640
No!

1183
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:47,500
Nico!

1184
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:51,040
Jump or kick.

1185
00:52:57,710 --> 00:52:58,850
That's what we thought, Nico.

1186
00:52:58,850 --> 00:53:00,530
Yeah, that's what we thought, bitch!

1187
00:53:02,390 --> 00:53:03,490
Jump or kick.

1188
00:53:07,430 --> 00:53:08,950
Oh my god, bro.

1189
00:53:09,070 --> 00:53:11,590
Okay, to be fair, I played with a lot of people.

1190
00:53:11,590 --> 00:53:12,810
I don't know, these are the first seasons of...

1191
00:53:13,710 --> 00:53:14,850
What's going on?

1192
00:53:15,970 --> 00:53:17,530
I'm okay, I'm okay.

1193
00:53:18,950 --> 00:53:19,450
Goofy!

1194
00:53:20,570 --> 00:53:21,070
Goofy!

1195
00:53:24,070 --> 00:53:24,910
Goofy, stop!

1196
00:53:25,570 --> 00:53:26,430
Just die!

1197
00:53:27,450 --> 00:53:28,570
So I can press you.

1198
00:53:30,310 --> 00:53:31,750
There we go, Nico got you.

1199
00:53:33,910 --> 00:53:35,430
I literally got you!

1200
00:53:35,510 --> 00:53:36,630
I literally got you!

1201
00:53:37,290 --> 00:53:38,690
Okay, that's not my fault.

1202
00:53:38,830 --> 00:53:40,470
Nico got, or literally killed him for us.

1203
00:53:41,590 --> 00:53:42,850
Oh my god!

1204
00:53:43,930 --> 00:53:44,410
Okay.

1205
00:53:46,130 --> 00:53:46,610
Alright.

1206
00:53:47,290 --> 00:53:48,590
Sorry, Nico's got us.

1207
00:53:50,290 --> 00:53:51,730
I literally have one gun.

1208
00:53:51,810 --> 00:53:52,970
There's more people, there's more people.

1209
00:53:53,110 --> 00:53:54,490
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

1210
00:53:55,110 --> 00:53:55,650
It's fine.

1211
00:53:56,850 --> 00:53:57,750
It's not fine!

1212
00:53:58,530 --> 00:54:00,790
I cracked him, I literally cracked him, please!

1213
00:54:02,310 --> 00:54:02,990
Nico, no!

1214
00:54:03,310 --> 00:54:03,790
Nico!

1215
00:54:06,790 --> 00:54:07,530
Clutch your kick!

1216
00:54:08,710 --> 00:54:09,350
Clutch your kick!

1217
00:54:09,370 --> 00:54:09,890
Clutch your kick!

1218
00:54:11,270 --> 00:54:13,730
Oh my god, he has an arrow in him!

1219
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:14,430
I don't have one of those!

1220
00:54:17,530 --> 00:54:18,630
Oh my god, he can talk!

1221
00:54:19,490 --> 00:54:23,410
He's not just a fucking Apex bot, he actually can speak!

1222
00:54:24,430 --> 00:54:29,290
He can actually talk!

1223
00:54:31,550 --> 00:54:33,810
He's kind of moving like a Fortnite bot right now.

1224
00:54:33,890 --> 00:54:34,310
I like it.

1225
00:54:34,410 --> 00:54:36,610
Okay, I think he has to be mousing keyboard.

1226
00:54:37,810 --> 00:54:38,770
I remember...

1227
00:54:38,770 --> 00:54:41,350
Because I only play with MNK players in season 3.

1228
00:54:41,890 --> 00:54:44,150
Because controller players never existed back then.

1229
00:54:44,510 --> 00:54:44,570
Oh!

1230
00:54:44,710 --> 00:54:45,190
Oh!

1231
00:54:45,370 --> 00:54:45,850
Oh!

1232
00:54:48,650 --> 00:54:49,930
Go Nico, go!

1233
00:54:50,590 --> 00:54:51,890
Oh my god, he grabbed me!

1234
00:54:52,950 --> 00:54:53,430
Leave!

1235
00:54:53,430 --> 00:54:54,150
Just leave!

1236
00:54:54,270 --> 00:54:54,570
Nico, run!

1237
00:54:55,050 --> 00:54:55,950
Nico, run!

1238
00:54:56,350 --> 00:54:58,650
Put your heirloom away, man!

1239
00:54:59,490 --> 00:55:01,850
Look, he earned that fair and square, Gumi.

1240
00:55:02,150 --> 00:55:02,630
He...

1241
00:55:02,630 --> 00:55:04,050
Oh my god, Nico!

1242
00:55:06,130 --> 00:55:07,170
It's okay, he's fine.

1243
00:55:09,370 --> 00:55:10,490
It's Nico time.

1244
00:55:10,810 --> 00:55:12,670
It's Nico time.

1245
00:55:17,090 --> 00:55:18,530
This is really cool.

1246
00:55:19,010 --> 00:55:19,570
You know what?

1247
00:55:19,690 --> 00:55:20,810
It's a good thing we died.

1248
00:55:20,910 --> 00:55:22,610
Now we can actually watch real gameplay.

1249
00:55:23,110 --> 00:55:25,190
Yeah, now I'm opening up MNK again.

1250
00:55:25,590 --> 00:55:29,110
Now this is like actual real gameplay.

1251
00:55:29,310 --> 00:55:31,530
Someone that can actually play Apex.

1252
00:55:32,710 --> 00:55:35,270
I don't know when was the last time I played.

1253
00:55:35,530 --> 00:55:36,710
Thanks for the... Oh my god, he's got the brain!

1254
00:55:37,530 --> 00:55:38,090
Thanks for the free...

1255
00:55:38,090 --> 00:55:40,050
Thanks for the free entertainment, Nico!

1256
00:55:42,930 --> 00:55:44,230
Oh my god, nice.

1257
00:55:45,350 --> 00:55:46,390
Nico POV.

1258
00:55:46,590 --> 00:55:49,010
I swear to god, I bet my chat's like, I hope you...

1259
00:55:49,010 --> 00:55:50,090
I hope you...

1260
00:55:52,250 --> 00:55:54,910
I hope you die again in-game so...

1261
00:55:54,910 --> 00:55:56,370
you can watch Nico.

1262
00:55:56,610 --> 00:55:57,610
So we can...

1263
00:55:58,610 --> 00:56:01,530
I swear they still only have...

1264
00:56:02,170 --> 00:56:03,650
I swear they still only have...

1265
00:56:03,650 --> 00:56:04,210
like, whoa!

1266
00:56:04,210 --> 00:56:05,390
I'm scared!

1267
00:56:05,770 --> 00:56:06,670
I'm scared!

1268
00:56:06,810 --> 00:56:07,890
I'm scared, Doki!

1269
00:56:08,030 --> 00:56:08,930
I'm so scared!

1270
00:56:09,670 --> 00:56:10,330
I'm fucked.

1271
00:56:10,690 --> 00:56:12,090
Nico, I cracked one.

1272
00:56:12,270 --> 00:56:12,950
Get up.

1273
00:56:13,950 --> 00:56:15,590
Okay, the thing is...

1274
00:56:16,210 --> 00:56:18,170
I don't think Nico is getting them.

1275
00:56:18,870 --> 00:56:19,930
Doki, there's...

1276
00:56:19,930 --> 00:56:21,230
two... there's...

1277
00:56:21,950 --> 00:56:23,510
They have literally...

1278
00:56:23,510 --> 00:56:25,050
They have purple armor.

1279
00:56:25,990 --> 00:56:27,290
They have purple armor.

1280
00:56:29,790 --> 00:56:30,470
It's okay.

1281
00:56:30,750 --> 00:56:31,470
It's okay.

1282
00:56:31,950 --> 00:56:32,590
I'll be... come back.

1283
00:56:32,610 --> 00:56:32,990
I'll come back.

1284
00:56:33,030 --> 00:56:33,470
I swear to god.

1285
00:56:34,210 --> 00:56:34,410
I'll be... come back.

1286
00:56:34,610 --> 00:56:35,250
I swear to god.

1287
00:56:35,550 --> 00:56:36,410
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1288
00:56:36,470 --> 00:56:37,350
I feel like I've heard this before.

1289
00:56:37,550 --> 00:56:38,330
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1290
00:56:38,330 --> 00:56:39,710
I swear to god I'll come back.

1291
00:56:39,710 --> 00:56:41,750
I swear to god I'll come back.

1292
00:56:41,810 --> 00:56:42,510
Don't worry, Yumi.

1293
00:56:43,230 --> 00:56:44,310
What are they gonna do?

1294
00:56:44,490 --> 00:56:46,470
Like, cap your bodies until you die?

1295
00:56:47,030 --> 00:56:47,750
There's no way.

1296
00:56:49,290 --> 00:56:49,610
Maybe.

1297
00:56:49,610 --> 00:56:50,350
Maybe they will.

1298
00:56:50,350 --> 00:56:52,230
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1299
00:56:52,410 --> 00:56:53,970
There's no way they'll get that cringe.

1300
00:56:54,110 --> 00:56:55,130
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1301
00:56:55,670 --> 00:56:55,990
Right?

1302
00:56:56,910 --> 00:56:57,650
There's no way.

1303
00:56:58,590 --> 00:56:59,690
They wouldn't do that to us.

1304
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:00,450
We're streamers.

1305
00:57:04,590 --> 00:57:04,990
Right?

1306
00:57:08,630 --> 00:57:09,030
Um...

1307
00:57:09,030 --> 00:57:12,490
Okay, you guys can't say clutch or kick to me because I'm literally streaming.

1308
00:57:12,790 --> 00:57:13,110
Yeah.

1309
00:57:14,890 --> 00:57:15,290
Alright.

1310
00:57:15,950 --> 00:57:16,710
Are they there?

1311
00:57:19,430 --> 00:57:21,010
Who the fuck are you asking?

1312
00:57:21,110 --> 00:57:21,690
I don't know!

1313
00:57:22,010 --> 00:57:23,770
You guys might have better eyes than me!

1314
00:57:24,670 --> 00:57:26,170
I'm looking from your eyes!

1315
00:57:26,730 --> 00:57:28,630
Yeah, but you guys might look better.

1316
00:57:28,730 --> 00:57:29,210
Oh, nice.

1317
00:57:29,350 --> 00:57:29,790
Okay, there you go.

1318
00:57:29,870 --> 00:57:30,850
See, I told you guys.

1319
00:57:31,010 --> 00:57:31,710
I told you.

1320
00:57:32,310 --> 00:57:34,190
Alright, I do have better eyes than you.

1321
00:57:34,210 --> 00:57:35,430
I said, oh, don't fear you!

1322
00:57:35,630 --> 00:57:35,950
What?

1323
00:57:36,650 --> 00:57:37,050
What?

1324
00:57:37,670 --> 00:57:38,070
Ah!

1325
00:57:40,610 --> 00:57:41,010
Ah!

1326
00:57:43,130 --> 00:57:44,610
Okay, okay, it's fine.

1327
00:57:44,770 --> 00:57:45,930
Oh, I accidentally...

1328
00:57:45,930 --> 00:57:46,610
There we go.

1329
00:57:48,490 --> 00:57:49,470
Alright, it's fine.

1330
00:57:49,550 --> 00:57:49,950
We're fine.

1331
00:57:50,630 --> 00:57:51,210
It's fine.

1332
00:57:52,730 --> 00:57:54,890
I don't know why the fuck the crypto was there.

1333
00:57:56,010 --> 00:57:56,410
Yeah.

1334
00:57:56,850 --> 00:57:57,450
That was...

1335
00:57:57,890 --> 00:57:59,910
Alright, it's fine.

1336
00:57:59,970 --> 00:58:00,310
We're fine.

1337
00:58:01,130 --> 00:58:02,310
Hey, what is that little yellow...

1338
00:58:03,250 --> 00:58:04,030
I have... Oh!

1339
00:58:04,210 --> 00:58:04,990
It's an armor upgrade.

1340
00:58:05,050 --> 00:58:08,410
I swear to god I heard the fucking crypto again!

1341
00:58:10,830 --> 00:58:11,630
Oh, me?

1342
00:58:11,790 --> 00:58:12,570
Oh, me?

1343
00:58:12,570 --> 00:58:12,610
I'm alone!

1344
00:58:16,030 --> 00:58:17,110
Holy shit!

1345
00:58:18,150 --> 00:58:19,910
What is the piece that could be crushed then?

1346
00:58:21,530 --> 00:58:23,250
Oh my god, I dead slid.

1347
00:58:23,770 --> 00:58:24,830
I dead slid.

1348
00:58:27,310 --> 00:58:28,710
I slid myself.

1349
00:58:31,050 --> 00:58:32,070
I panicked.

1350
00:58:32,070 --> 00:58:32,790
I panicked.

1351
00:58:35,870 --> 00:58:37,290
Okay, that was...

1352
00:58:38,070 --> 00:58:39,490
Ice creamer!

1353
00:58:39,750 --> 00:58:41,110
Shut the fuck up!

1354
00:58:42,090 --> 00:58:43,470
I'm panicking!

1355
00:58:43,890 --> 00:58:45,450
I'm literally panicking!

1356
00:58:45,950 --> 00:58:49,130
I didn't get enough sleep to be doing this.

1357
00:58:50,450 --> 00:58:50,950
I didn't get enough sleep to be doing this.

1358
00:58:52,470 --> 00:58:53,770
My fire...

1359
00:58:55,010 --> 00:58:56,450
My water...

1360
00:58:56,450 --> 00:58:57,750
Shut the fuck up!

1361
00:58:58,870 --> 00:59:00,050
Is my...

1362
00:59:00,050 --> 00:59:01,010
Air...

1363
00:59:02,070 --> 00:59:02,590
Oh, they're fighting!

1364
00:59:02,810 --> 00:59:03,770
Okay, nice.

1365
00:59:03,970 --> 00:59:04,290
Okay.

1366
00:59:04,630 --> 00:59:05,190
Alright.

1367
00:59:06,090 --> 00:59:09,690
It's like they're so confused at me nading myself that they just...

1368
00:59:09,690 --> 00:59:12,530
They stop chasing me.

1369
00:59:12,930 --> 00:59:14,250
Am I singing calm me down?

1370
00:59:14,330 --> 00:59:14,570
I know.

1371
00:59:14,850 --> 00:59:15,410
Yeah.

1372
00:59:16,550 --> 00:59:17,590
We'll say that.

1373
00:59:17,870 --> 00:59:19,850
Yeah, yeah.

1374
00:59:20,190 --> 00:59:21,530
Beautiful singing, Gumi.

1375
00:59:22,070 --> 00:59:23,190
Beautiful singing.

1376
00:59:24,190 --> 00:59:25,050
Alright, don't worry.

1377
00:59:25,250 --> 00:59:25,790
We're fine.

1378
00:59:27,050 --> 00:59:27,510
Oh, yeah.

1379
00:59:27,630 --> 00:59:28,310
We're fine.

1380
00:59:28,370 --> 00:59:28,590
See?

1381
00:59:28,770 --> 00:59:29,630
I calmed down.

1382
00:59:29,630 --> 00:59:31,270
I calmed down.

1383
00:59:32,590 --> 00:59:33,070
See?

1384
00:59:33,550 --> 00:59:33,950
Look at that.

1385
00:59:34,670 --> 00:59:36,410
I just needed a rest, you guys.

1386
00:59:36,570 --> 00:59:38,650
And it's just like nothing bad happened.

1387
00:59:41,150 --> 00:59:41,630
Everything's fine.

1388
00:59:42,010 --> 00:59:42,730
Everything's fine.

1389
00:59:42,750 --> 00:59:44,350
What did they do to the train yard?

1390
00:59:45,070 --> 00:59:46,110
Boy, it looks the same.

1391
00:59:47,470 --> 00:59:49,730
That's literally what it looked like last season.

1392
00:59:50,430 --> 00:59:50,910
No.

1393
00:59:51,050 --> 00:59:55,590
What happened to the flo- Everything's different.

1394
00:59:56,650 --> 00:59:57,710
It's just literally...

1395
00:59:57,710 --> 00:59:58,650
This looks different.

1396
00:59:59,630 --> 01:00:00,330
They made it purple.

1397
01:00:02,230 --> 01:00:03,170
Looks the same.

1398
01:00:04,830 --> 01:00:06,170
Oh, we're in a floating train car.

1399
01:00:06,170 --> 01:00:07,510
Okay, okay, Gumi.

1400
01:00:07,630 --> 01:00:09,610
You haven't played Apex in a while.

1401
01:00:10,230 --> 01:00:12,090
Dude, I feel like a boomer.

1402
01:00:12,090 --> 01:00:12,530
I feel it.

1403
01:00:12,530 --> 01:00:15,190
You literally haven't played Apex in so long.

1404
01:00:15,290 --> 01:00:18,430
It's literally the same train yard.

1405
01:00:18,850 --> 01:00:19,030
That's funny.

1406
01:00:19,030 --> 01:00:20,690
This would cost 25 cents.

1407
01:00:21,350 --> 01:00:22,670
Oh, I need to make my bat.

1408
01:00:22,950 --> 01:00:23,510
Oh, yeah.

1409
01:00:23,510 --> 01:00:25,150
You can only use replicator like once now.

1410
01:00:25,790 --> 01:00:26,310
What?

1411
01:00:26,630 --> 01:00:27,150
Yeah.

1412
01:00:29,630 --> 01:00:30,190
We're all okay.

1413
01:00:30,450 --> 01:00:36,490
I'm still with the shittiest guns possible right now with zero attachments.

1414
01:00:37,210 --> 01:00:38,190
And that's okay.

1415
01:00:39,190 --> 01:00:39,710
Nice.

1416
01:00:39,770 --> 01:00:40,250
I upgraded.

1417
01:00:40,570 --> 01:00:41,090
What?

1418
01:00:41,230 --> 01:00:41,810
I upgraded.

1419
01:00:44,830 --> 01:00:45,490
Don't worry.

1420
01:00:45,570 --> 01:00:46,410
I upgraded our shit.

1421
01:00:46,530 --> 01:00:46,810
Oh, nice.

1422
01:00:47,050 --> 01:00:49,570
There's like fights near us on the other side.

1423
01:00:49,990 --> 01:00:51,130
There's not a vault here.

1424
01:00:51,470 --> 01:00:52,010
No, I'm good.

1425
01:00:52,930 --> 01:00:53,650
I'm good.

1426
01:00:56,670 --> 01:00:57,290
It's okay.

1427
01:00:57,290 --> 01:00:57,870
We have Niko.

1428
01:00:57,990 --> 01:01:00,510
I bet you Niko's gonna get our first win today.

1429
01:01:02,190 --> 01:01:02,630
Really?

1430
01:01:03,530 --> 01:01:04,330
Oh, shit.

1431
01:01:04,390 --> 01:01:05,070
Niko might be dead.

1432
01:01:05,170 --> 01:01:05,610
Niko!

1433
01:01:05,850 --> 01:01:06,290
Niko!

1434
01:01:06,410 --> 01:01:07,470
Wake up, Niko!

1435
01:01:08,450 --> 01:01:09,770
Wake up, samurai.

1436
01:01:10,290 --> 01:01:11,110
That's my ult.

1437
01:01:11,190 --> 01:01:12,090
I'm gonna hurt myself.

1438
01:01:12,390 --> 01:01:12,910
Help me, Niko!

1439
01:01:14,450 --> 01:01:15,130
It's my ult.

1440
01:01:15,230 --> 01:01:15,670
It's my ult.

1441
01:01:15,710 --> 01:01:16,090
It's my ult.

1442
01:01:16,190 --> 01:01:16,850
You're fine.

1443
01:01:17,150 --> 01:01:17,810
You're fine.

1444
01:01:18,390 --> 01:01:19,350
I hit nothing.

1445
01:01:20,570 --> 01:01:21,190
That's cool.

1446
01:01:22,270 --> 01:01:23,110
Go me!

1447
01:01:23,190 --> 01:01:23,830
Go me!

1448
01:01:23,830 --> 01:01:24,630
Go me?

1449
01:01:24,770 --> 01:01:25,450
What's going on?

1450
01:01:26,330 --> 01:01:27,090
Where are they?

1451
01:01:27,170 --> 01:01:27,830
Can you ping it?

1452
01:01:28,770 --> 01:01:29,970
I don't see nothing.

1453
01:01:30,190 --> 01:01:30,950
I'm in a few, salty.

1454
01:01:31,390 --> 01:01:32,310
Where are they?

1455
01:01:35,930 --> 01:01:36,390
Oh!

1456
01:01:36,390 --> 01:01:36,850
Splash!

1457
01:01:36,890 --> 01:01:37,350
Got him!

1458
01:01:38,870 --> 01:01:39,570
Got Nicholas!

1459
01:01:42,130 --> 01:01:43,250
His teammates over there.

1460
01:01:43,710 --> 01:01:44,490
Yeah, I got him.

1461
01:01:44,570 --> 01:01:45,110
Cracked him.

1462
01:01:45,530 --> 01:01:46,270
He's plush.

1463
01:01:47,650 --> 01:01:48,110
Stupid.

1464
01:01:48,750 --> 01:01:49,210
Nice.

1465
01:01:49,710 --> 01:01:50,170
Yeah!

1466
01:01:51,110 --> 01:01:52,270
Look at us go.

1467
01:01:52,350 --> 01:01:53,190
We're gaming.

1468
01:01:54,290 --> 01:01:55,990
We're so much better.

1469
01:01:56,190 --> 01:01:56,750
Look at that.

1470
01:01:57,970 --> 01:01:58,310
We're so much better.

1471
01:01:58,570 --> 01:02:01,190
Are you okay?

1472
01:02:01,950 --> 01:02:03,070
Are you okay?

1473
01:02:05,170 --> 01:02:09,870
Let me look at sound check guys and see if you're not bursting people's eardrums.

1474
01:02:12,170 --> 01:02:14,330
Okay, he's like, everything is good.

1475
01:02:14,530 --> 01:02:16,270
Go me!

1476
01:02:16,490 --> 01:02:16,950
Stop!

1477
01:02:17,070 --> 01:02:17,850
Go me!

1478
01:02:17,850 --> 01:02:18,450
Go me!

1479
01:02:18,630 --> 01:02:20,250
Stop getting shot at!

1480
01:02:20,490 --> 01:02:20,930
Go me!

1481
01:02:21,190 --> 01:02:21,830
Go me!

1482
01:02:25,010 --> 01:02:25,730
I'm okay.

1483
01:02:27,730 --> 01:02:29,330
Oh my god, I hit nothing.

1484
01:02:29,790 --> 01:02:30,490
That's awkward.

1485
01:02:31,730 --> 01:02:33,090
I didn't hit a single thing.

1486
01:02:35,550 --> 01:02:36,370
Where are you?

1487
01:02:37,010 --> 01:02:37,670
Nico, no!

1488
01:02:39,670 --> 01:02:40,890
How are we gonna win?

1489
01:02:41,730 --> 01:02:42,510
Oh, they're coming!

1490
01:02:43,150 --> 01:02:45,850
Oh, I can't see.

1491
01:02:45,890 --> 01:02:47,010
I can't see for you.

1492
01:02:47,290 --> 01:02:48,270
I can't cover you.

1493
01:02:49,010 --> 01:02:50,050
Wait, they have red armor.

1494
01:02:50,150 --> 01:02:50,670
Wait, they're gamers.

1495
01:02:51,950 --> 01:02:53,750
Wait, we lost our actual carry.

1496
01:02:54,090 --> 01:02:55,310
What the fuck do we do?

1497
01:02:57,130 --> 01:02:59,890
What the fuck do we do?

1498
01:03:01,590 --> 01:03:02,210
By the way, they're...

1499
01:03:02,210 --> 01:03:03,090
I don't have red armor!

1500
01:03:03,090 --> 01:03:03,690
I died, Goomy.

1501
01:03:03,870 --> 01:03:05,570
I can't help you.

1502
01:03:06,330 --> 01:03:07,770
Oh, you're dead too.

1503
01:03:09,710 --> 01:03:10,330
Monkey?

1504
01:03:10,910 --> 01:03:11,430
Monkey?

1505
01:03:11,750 --> 01:03:12,850
Wait, you're still alive!

1506
01:03:13,030 --> 01:03:14,050
I thought you were dead.

1507
01:03:14,710 --> 01:03:15,270
Oh my god!

1508
01:03:15,830 --> 01:03:17,250
Oh my god!

1509
01:03:23,260 --> 01:03:25,860
Are you okay?

1510
01:03:26,120 --> 01:03:27,620
Are you okay?

1511
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:29,020
Are you okay?

1512
01:03:29,020 --> 01:03:29,920
Why didn't you...

1513
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:32,040
Why didn't you Q-inter?

1514
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:34,440
They went up my ass!

1515
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:35,940
They went up my ass!

1516
01:03:36,060 --> 01:03:38,540
You could have ran!

1517
01:03:39,340 --> 01:03:42,960
I abandoned you!

1518
01:03:43,220 --> 01:03:45,240
What do you mean I abandoned you?

1519
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:46,760
What?

1520
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:49,020
You were not funny.

1521
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:51,980
Yes, you could have done that!

1522
01:03:52,420 --> 01:03:53,900
You could have... I abandoned you!

1523
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:55,300
I abandoned you and came back!

1524
01:03:56,560 --> 01:03:57,180
That's okay.

1525
01:03:57,340 --> 01:03:57,520
No.

1526
01:03:57,880 --> 01:03:59,680
We all know it's Nico's fault.

1527
01:04:00,260 --> 01:04:01,220
Yeah, fuck you Nico.

1528
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:02,020
Yeah, fuck you Nico.

1529
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:02,780
How dare you.

1530
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:05,520
Why are you in our three stack if you're not clutch?

1531
01:04:05,580 --> 01:04:07,140
If you're not clutching.

1532
01:04:08,560 --> 01:04:09,020
Wait!

1533
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:10,160
We're three stacking!

1534
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:10,980
We should play rank!

1535
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:12,120
We're all...

1536
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:15,100
We should play rank!

1537
01:04:16,420 --> 01:04:18,400
We could be farming the bronze players!

1538
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:20,420
The real bronze...

1539
01:04:20,420 --> 01:04:21,140
It's like...

1540
01:04:21,140 --> 01:04:22,280
Okay, look.

1541
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:23,180
Okay, hear me out.

1542
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:24,440
The game came out...

1543
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:26,920
The new season patch came out like...

1544
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:28,840
11, 12, 1, 2... 4 hours ago.

1545
01:04:30,540 --> 01:04:32,760
Preds shouldn't be in Rookie anymore at that point.

1546
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:34,720
They should have ranked out of it.

1547
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:39,220
I have people from DSG and they're ranking up right now, surely.

1548
01:04:40,820 --> 01:04:43,780
Which means all the Preds are playing right now, right?

1549
01:04:43,780 --> 01:04:44,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1550
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:44,820
They're all playing.

1551
01:04:44,940 --> 01:04:46,440
But they've been playing for 4 hours.

1552
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,120
If they play for 4 hours...

1553
01:04:49,120 --> 01:04:52,120
What if they keep inting each other and they're all still bronze?

1554
01:04:52,180 --> 01:04:52,940
There's no way!

1555
01:04:53,240 --> 01:04:54,840
Then they're dogshit!

1556
01:04:56,080 --> 01:04:56,640
Oh!

1557
01:04:57,860 --> 01:04:59,280
Okay, I didn't say it.

1558
01:05:01,240 --> 01:05:03,020
All I'm saying is...

1559
01:05:03,020 --> 01:05:05,120
If they're still in bronze...

1560
01:05:06,540 --> 01:05:07,480
Not even bronze.

1561
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:08,460
They start off at Rookie.

1562
01:05:08,660 --> 01:05:11,320
We start at Rookie because everyone starts at one point.

1563
01:05:12,020 --> 01:05:12,580
Look.

1564
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:15,120
I'm saying if in 4 hours...

1565
01:05:15,740 --> 01:05:17,620
You're still in Rookie.

1566
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:18,900
And you're...

1567
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:22,860
You're a professional player that gets paid to play Apex Legends...

1568
01:05:22,860 --> 01:05:25,420
It's not an us problem.

1569
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:26,760
It's a you problem.

1570
01:05:27,940 --> 01:05:28,940
It's okay, we have Niko.

1571
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:33,420
Niko, if you hand that shit over...

1572
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:34,840
What the fuck, Niko?

1573
01:05:36,820 --> 01:05:38,040
Don't worry, we say one thing.

1574
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:39,000
Clutch or jump.

1575
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:39,880
Oh, wait, wait.

1576
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:40,520
Kick or jump.

1577
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:48,020
There you go.

1578
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:50,100
Oh my... Niko!

1579
01:05:51,380 --> 01:05:52,560
Jump or kick.

1580
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:54,520
That's not it.

1581
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:55,420
That's not it.

1582
01:05:58,940 --> 01:05:59,460
Alright,

1583
01:06:03,340 --> 01:06:03,820
here we go.

1584
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:04,780
Isn't it great?

1585
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:07,600
Isn't it great when we have a carry?

1586
01:06:08,020 --> 01:06:10,280
I see people here with us, Doki.

1587
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:12,860
It's okay, we have a carry.

1588
01:06:14,100 --> 01:06:15,060
It's some guy...

1589
01:06:15,060 --> 01:06:16,220
used to play in Season 3.

1590
01:06:16,980 --> 01:06:18,500
Doki, they're gonna beat his ass!

1591
01:06:18,620 --> 01:06:19,100
They're beating his ass!

1592
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:19,880
It's okay!

1593
01:06:20,260 --> 01:06:22,120
As long as it's not us, it's okay.

1594
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:28,020
Oh shit, maybe we should help him.

1595
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:28,980
Oh shit, maybe we should help him.

1596
01:06:28,980 --> 01:06:29,220
Coming over!

1597
01:06:32,460 --> 01:06:33,900
Oh shit, Niko, no!

1598
01:06:34,340 --> 01:06:34,640
Oh shit, Niko, no!

1599
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:35,100
Oh, he's got him.

1600
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:37,040
Niko, don't die, cause I need ammo.

1601
01:06:37,640 --> 01:06:39,360
Don't die, cause I...

1602
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:40,180
Damn.

1603
01:06:42,100 --> 01:06:43,600
Where's the third?

1604
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:48,540
Where the fuck is the third player?

1605
01:06:48,540 --> 01:06:50,020
There's fuckers!

1606
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:52,240
Oh shit!

1607
01:06:52,340 --> 01:06:53,160
Oh, go away!

1608
01:06:53,300 --> 01:06:53,840
What happened?

1609
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:56,680
It's the... it's the fucker!

1610
01:06:57,300 --> 01:06:57,860
Where?

1611
01:06:58,640 --> 01:06:59,740
Oh, I'll raise you.

1612
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:01,720
Don't worry, Niko's got this.

1613
01:07:02,100 --> 01:07:02,660
See?

1614
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:05,360
We killed the TTV-er!

1615
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:07,160
And New York!

1616
01:07:07,860 --> 01:07:08,740
There's a new team.

1617
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:12,060
Blocking this.

1618
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:13,120
Ow!

1619
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:15,280
Oh, I can't see anything.

1620
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:17,320
Nice.

1621
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:19,640
There's a teammate.

1622
01:07:20,580 --> 01:07:21,380
Where's your craft?

1623
01:07:23,480 --> 01:07:23,940
Where?

1624
01:07:24,380 --> 01:07:25,340
Oh shit, here!

1625
01:07:25,560 --> 01:07:26,020
Okay.

1626
01:07:26,700 --> 01:07:27,160
Easy.

1627
01:07:29,140 --> 01:07:30,060
So easy.

1628
01:07:30,580 --> 01:07:32,480
Oh, it's like the new armor swap.

1629
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:35,240
But instead of swapping the armor, it just fills up your armor.

1630
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:36,500
Oh.

1631
01:07:39,360 --> 01:07:41,080
Oh hey, we killed everybody here!

1632
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:41,360
See?

1633
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:42,760
What were you worried about?

1634
01:07:43,540 --> 01:07:44,720
Yeah, I have 2 KP.

1635
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:45,940
I'm a big kid now.

1636
01:07:46,120 --> 01:07:48,360
Yeah, but what's your damage?

1637
01:07:48,540 --> 01:07:48,920
Huh?

1638
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:50,880
600.

1639
01:07:51,780 --> 01:07:53,580
Oh yeah, I have 7...

1640
01:07:53,580 --> 01:07:53,900
Oh shit.

1641
01:07:54,060 --> 01:07:56,940
I have 705.

1642
01:07:58,520 --> 01:07:59,220
What the?

1643
01:07:59,560 --> 01:07:59,900
Yeah.

1644
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:02,120
Now you're making shit up.

1645
01:08:02,320 --> 01:08:02,640
What, me?

1646
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:03,680
No.

1647
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:06,960
Wait, wait, wait.

1648
01:08:07,240 --> 01:08:07,620
Sorry.

1649
01:08:08,520 --> 01:08:10,340
Sorry, verbal typo.

1650
01:08:10,380 --> 01:08:11,120
I mean...

1651
01:08:13,080 --> 01:08:14,960
Sorry, I had a mini stroke right now.

1652
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:16,500
I'm at 130.

1653
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:18,520
Oh.

1654
01:08:18,540 --> 01:08:20,000
Oh hey, everyone makes shit up.

1655
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:20,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1656
01:08:21,940 --> 01:08:22,340
Whoa!

1657
01:08:22,340 --> 01:08:23,060
Gold backpack!

1658
01:08:25,340 --> 01:08:25,740
Oh.

1659
01:08:27,140 --> 01:08:29,120
I thought I was like wondering what he's shooting at.

1660
01:08:30,580 --> 01:08:30,980
Uh...

1661
01:08:30,980 --> 01:08:31,940
Alright, let me...

1662
01:08:32,440 --> 01:08:33,420
Get rid of my battery.

1663
01:08:34,680 --> 01:08:35,080
Whoa!

1664
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:36,120
Oh, I heard like...

1665
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:38,000
I heard the...

1666
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,180
Oh my god, Nico, are you getting fucked in HD?

1667
01:08:40,540 --> 01:08:40,800
52.

1668
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:44,540
Is the 2 team a 2?

1669
01:08:45,660 --> 01:08:46,440
I think it's 3.

1670
01:08:46,440 --> 01:08:47,440
I cracked the seer though.

1671
01:08:48,780 --> 01:08:50,800
I only saw 2 with my little passive.

1672
01:08:52,100 --> 01:08:52,840
Cracked the seer again?

1673
01:08:53,220 --> 01:08:53,880
Alright, do it.

1674
01:08:53,900 --> 01:08:54,760
Come on, go, go, go, go, go, go!

1675
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:55,680
I believe in you, Gumi!

1676
01:08:56,180 --> 01:08:57,220
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

1677
01:08:57,660 --> 01:08:57,980
Whoa!

1678
01:08:58,060 --> 01:08:59,520
I sure hope my teammates are here with me!

1679
01:09:00,860 --> 01:09:01,180
Whoa!

1680
01:09:01,340 --> 01:09:02,260
I sure hope so too!

1681
01:09:04,860 --> 01:09:06,000
Wait, where's the seer?

1682
01:09:06,420 --> 01:09:06,960
Oh, on me.

1683
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:07,800
Hello!

1684
01:09:10,740 --> 01:09:11,060
Nice.

1685
01:09:12,420 --> 01:09:14,340
I feel like it's so cluttered though.

1686
01:09:14,340 --> 01:09:15,020
Like all the...

1687
01:09:15,020 --> 01:09:17,400
the words on my screen.

1688
01:09:18,440 --> 01:09:20,120
Yeah, I don't know how to read.

1689
01:09:20,740 --> 01:09:22,240
Senior by ordinance.

1690
01:09:22,660 --> 01:09:23,560
I don't need names.

1691
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:26,060
It just feels so cluttered.

1692
01:09:27,380 --> 01:09:29,300
Is Nico single?

1693
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:30,800
Is Nico single?

1694
01:09:31,060 --> 01:09:32,300
Alright, who wants to be the...

1695
01:09:32,300 --> 01:09:34,400
You don't even know how old he is, man!

1696
01:09:34,740 --> 01:09:35,660
Hold on!

1697
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:39,640
First off, we gotta ask how old Nico is!

1698
01:09:40,140 --> 01:09:41,340
First off!

1699
01:09:42,420 --> 01:09:43,000
First off!

1700
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:43,800
What is that?

1701
01:09:44,340 --> 01:09:50,560
Before we ask if anybody is single, we need to know how old Nico is!

1702
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:51,480
We need to know how old Nico is!

1703
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,920
Remember, the order of the questions matter!

1704
01:10:03,220 --> 01:10:03,820
Guys!

1705
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:05,380
The order of the questions!

1706
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:08,720
Guys, I know Valentine's is tomorrow, but remember!

1707
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:10,860
The order of questions!

1708
01:10:11,020 --> 01:10:11,820
The order of operations!

1709
01:10:12,820 --> 01:10:14,140
At least four!

1710
01:10:14,780 --> 01:10:18,560
The truth!

1711
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:21,460
The truth!

1712
01:10:21,460 --> 01:10:23,620
Nico, the fucking child prodigy!

1713
01:10:23,680 --> 01:10:25,740
Playing Apex in the fucking womb!

1714
01:10:26,220 --> 01:10:27,060
Playing Apex in the fucking womb!

1715
01:10:28,100 --> 01:10:28,820
Oh my god!

1716
01:10:28,940 --> 01:10:31,960
He's like that ten year old Apex Pred player or some shit.

1717
01:10:32,140 --> 01:10:32,700
You know, there's like...

1718
01:10:32,700 --> 01:10:33,460
What's his name?

1719
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:33,840
What?

1720
01:10:36,460 --> 01:10:39,520
There's like this controller prodigy Pred player.

1721
01:10:39,900 --> 01:10:41,700
Who's like this ten year old kid.

1722
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:43,840
And his like...

1723
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:46,000
His dad runs his like...

1724
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:47,200
Oh, there's people on us, I think.

1725
01:10:47,240 --> 01:10:48,860
His dad runs his like Twitch and everything.

1726
01:10:50,540 --> 01:10:54,080
And all he does is just play Apex while his dad controls his...

1727
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:54,200
Whoa!

1728
01:10:55,880 --> 01:10:56,460
You go!

1729
01:10:56,540 --> 01:10:56,800
Go!

1730
01:10:56,820 --> 01:10:57,000
Go!

1731
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:57,140
Go!

1732
01:10:57,180 --> 01:10:57,340
Go!

1733
01:10:57,340 --> 01:10:57,460
Go!

1734
01:10:57,460 --> 01:10:57,880
Go!

1735
01:10:57,880 --> 01:10:58,300
Go!

1736
01:10:58,620 --> 01:10:59,800
Go where?

1737
01:11:00,220 --> 01:11:00,620
Here!

1738
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:04,660
See?

1739
01:11:05,740 --> 01:11:06,760
Oh, we gotta help Nico.

1740
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:08,500
Wait, they're rezzing!

1741
01:11:14,510 --> 01:11:15,190
Where is he?

1742
01:11:15,270 --> 01:11:15,730
Oh shit!

1743
01:11:17,390 --> 01:11:18,270
Oh, this is dead.

1744
01:11:18,930 --> 01:11:19,670
I helped.

1745
01:11:20,010 --> 01:11:21,030
Yeah, you were there.

1746
01:11:22,370 --> 01:11:22,810
What?

1747
01:11:22,810 --> 01:11:24,190
I threw mage, man.

1748
01:11:24,410 --> 01:11:25,090
Yeah, you were there.

1749
01:11:26,150 --> 01:11:27,490
Yeah, I was there.

1750
01:11:32,370 --> 01:11:34,150
Sometimes I wonder if you're okay.

1751
01:11:35,870 --> 01:11:37,750
How the fuck he answer?

1752
01:11:45,940 --> 01:11:46,380
Alright.

1753
01:11:47,180 --> 01:11:49,060
Oh, I can heal myself in smoke.

1754
01:11:49,980 --> 01:11:51,360
Oh my god, we're gonna get our first win!

1755
01:11:52,020 --> 01:11:53,360
I believe in us.

1756
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:54,260
Don't say that!

1757
01:11:54,380 --> 01:11:55,560
We're gonna get our first win!

1758
01:11:55,960 --> 01:11:57,400
Wait, did I grab my shield back?

1759
01:11:57,420 --> 01:11:59,120
Oh my god, it cramps right away!

1760
01:11:59,240 --> 01:12:00,540
Yeah, that's the new update.

1761
01:12:00,620 --> 01:12:01,560
But you only craft once.

1762
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:04,160
YOLO.

1763
01:12:06,220 --> 01:12:07,760
Luvisa's as insane as ever.

1764
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:08,960
That's why she's my friend.

1765
01:12:09,660 --> 01:12:10,100
Yeah.

1766
01:12:11,180 --> 01:12:13,420
I need someone to make me feel normal.

1767
01:12:14,020 --> 01:12:14,460
What?

1768
01:12:14,700 --> 01:12:15,000
LOL.

1769
01:12:16,450 --> 01:12:16,720
LOL.

1770
01:12:20,120 --> 01:12:20,660
LOL.

1771
01:12:20,760 --> 01:12:21,300
LOL.

1772
01:12:21,900 --> 01:12:22,420
LOL.

1773
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:27,700
Hey, next to you, most normal person.

1774
01:12:27,780 --> 01:12:28,240
LOL.

1775
01:12:32,120 --> 01:12:33,180
I heard something.

1776
01:12:33,740 --> 01:12:34,320
It's okay.

1777
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:37,960
Oh, Narnia.

1778
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:38,740
Oh, yeah.

1779
01:12:38,860 --> 01:12:40,660
Okay, so if we don't look at them, they don't exist.

1780
01:12:40,820 --> 01:12:41,060
Right?

1781
01:12:41,260 --> 01:12:44,040
Ken only has a good day

1782
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:51,360
Whoa, Nico's just a Ken?

1783
01:12:52,820 --> 01:12:53,460
That's fucked up.

1784
01:12:53,700 --> 01:12:55,480
He can be a Barbie if he wants.

1785
01:12:56,480 --> 01:12:58,880
Not if he keeps relinquishing Jump Master.

1786
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:00,040
Ooh, that's true.

1787
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:11,740
Nico, do something!

1788
01:13:12,280 --> 01:13:12,600
Go!

1789
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:14,340
Kill everyone!

1790
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:16,320
Go, Goomy!

1791
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:18,460
Go, Goomy!

1792
01:13:18,460 --> 01:13:21,100
I see a motherfucker stay up right there!

1793
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:22,000
Yeah, they're over here.

1794
01:13:22,160 --> 01:13:22,680
Whoa, shit!

1795
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:23,400
Okay, I almost fell.

1796
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:24,460
Oh, righta, righta, righta!

1797
01:13:24,940 --> 01:13:25,900
How do I climb back up?

1798
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:26,360
There you go.

1799
01:13:27,620 --> 01:13:28,520
Go, Goomy, go.

1800
01:13:30,100 --> 01:13:31,420
Oh wait, no, he's all the way up there.

1801
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:31,760
Bastard!

1802
01:13:33,140 --> 01:13:34,780
Oh wait, they changed this a little bit.

1803
01:13:36,060 --> 01:13:36,380
Whoa!

1804
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:39,900
Knocked one.

1805
01:13:42,740 --> 01:13:43,760
Oh, right here.

1806
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:46,080
Oh, cracked him.

1807
01:13:46,900 --> 01:13:48,320
Oh, he's grappling away.

1808
01:13:49,700 --> 01:13:51,400
Oh my god, that poor guy.

1809
01:13:51,900 --> 01:13:53,480
I just saw him get executed.

1810
01:13:54,760 --> 01:13:56,640
Where the fuck is this Pathfinder though?

1811
01:13:57,380 --> 01:13:57,900
Above?

1812
01:13:59,320 --> 01:14:00,340
He's above me?

1813
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:03,440
Oh, oh!

1814
01:14:07,140 --> 01:14:09,440
Oh my god, he scared the shit out of me.

1815
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:11,740
He's like above me?

1816
01:14:13,980 --> 01:14:15,260
There's people behind me.

1817
01:14:15,460 --> 01:14:16,100
It's fine.

1818
01:14:16,580 --> 01:14:17,060
Whoa.

1819
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:18,740
Not fine, not fine.

1820
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:22,000
Whoa, where are you?

1821
01:14:22,240 --> 01:14:24,920
Um, there's a guy right here where I'm pinging.

1822
01:14:36,630 --> 01:14:38,630
What the fuck was he doing?

1823
01:14:38,690 --> 01:14:40,690
Why did he crouch there?

1824
01:14:41,570 --> 01:14:43,410
Another team is fighting in front of us.

1825
01:14:44,570 --> 01:14:45,450
There's a new team.

1826
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:56,860
My Oshiniko is not single.

1827
01:14:57,800 --> 01:14:59,580
I'm day ruined.

1828
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:01,040
No.

1829
01:15:04,180 --> 01:15:05,840
Oh, I got a heal now.

1830
01:15:06,020 --> 01:15:07,260
It's okay, I have self heal.

1831
01:15:07,380 --> 01:15:07,880
I'm leading.

1832
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:12,800
Oh shit.

1833
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:13,480
Oh, I'm knocked.

1834
01:15:14,140 --> 01:15:15,400
But I knocked one too.

1835
01:15:15,560 --> 01:15:15,960
Uh oh.

1836
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:17,360
Uh oh, uh oh.

1837
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:19,260
I'm shielding, I'm shielding.

1838
01:15:19,260 --> 01:15:19,600
Uh oh.

1839
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:19,680
Uh oh, uh oh.

1840
01:15:19,680 --> 01:15:20,580
Oh, they tried it!

1841
01:15:20,580 --> 01:15:21,520
Oh, they tried it!

1842
01:15:21,620 --> 01:15:21,960
Oh, they tried it!

1843
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:22,880
Oh, they tried it!

1844
01:15:22,900 --> 01:15:25,340
We got... No, we were so close!

1845
01:15:25,720 --> 01:15:27,600
Oh my god, what is this?

1846
01:15:27,700 --> 01:15:28,880
Nico, you ruined all of our days.

1847
01:15:29,240 --> 01:15:32,120
No, we just didn't three stack hard enough.

1848
01:15:32,260 --> 01:15:32,600
No, we just didn't three stack hard enough.

1849
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:35,680
We did not three stack hard enough.

1850
01:15:35,680 --> 01:15:36,460
I knocked mine.

1851
01:15:37,900 --> 01:15:38,380
We...

1852
01:15:40,860 --> 01:15:42,340
Alright, mate, don't worry.

1853
01:15:42,440 --> 01:15:43,820
We'll get first place in rank.

1854
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:44,720
Boot us up.

1855
01:15:44,780 --> 01:15:45,400
Lock us in.

1856
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:46,980
Okay.

1857
01:15:46,980 --> 01:15:47,780
Lock us in.

1858
01:15:48,180 --> 01:15:48,580
Okay.

1859
01:15:49,100 --> 01:15:49,500
Okay.

1860
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:50,400
Do it.

1861
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:53,340
Wait, is he rookie as well?

1862
01:15:54,120 --> 01:15:54,960
Okay, thank god.

1863
01:15:55,100 --> 01:15:56,040
Lock us in.

1864
01:15:58,540 --> 01:16:00,420
Alright, is Karnu still strong in rank?

1865
01:16:00,520 --> 01:16:01,340
I don't know what's meta.

1866
01:16:02,040 --> 01:16:03,240
I don't know what's meta either.

1867
01:16:03,340 --> 01:16:04,020
I just like Venti.

1868
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:06,200
Yeah, I know.

1869
01:16:09,740 --> 01:16:10,580
Okay, okay.

1870
01:16:10,720 --> 01:16:11,220
I know.

1871
01:16:11,420 --> 01:16:12,040
It's okay.

1872
01:16:12,380 --> 01:16:15,280
All the Preds... All the Preds ranked out are rookie.

1873
01:16:15,500 --> 01:16:16,260
There's no way.

1874
01:16:16,980 --> 01:16:17,900
There's no way we're that unlucky.

1875
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:22,980
We're gonna be the ones that that like bone rush all the players.

1876
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:24,280
Yes.

1877
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:26,520
Karnu got nerfed?

1878
01:16:26,720 --> 01:16:27,140
Oh, fuck.

1879
01:16:27,240 --> 01:16:28,120
Okay, I guess I'll play Bangalore.

1880
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:31,420
Apparently Karnu is nerfed.

1881
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:32,500
Wait, okay.

1882
01:16:32,660 --> 01:16:33,440
How about Seer?

1883
01:16:34,120 --> 01:16:35,120
I know how to play Seer.

1884
01:16:37,420 --> 01:16:37,940
Actually, no.

1885
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:38,760
I should play Bangalore.

1886
01:16:38,920 --> 01:16:39,980
That's my comfort pick.

1887
01:16:43,540 --> 01:16:44,660
No, there's no way.

1888
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:45,760
They had four hours.

1889
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:46,740
If they can't get a...

1890
01:16:46,980 --> 01:16:49,860
out of rookie in four hours, then why the fuck are they Pred?

1891
01:16:51,460 --> 01:16:51,940
Yeah.

1892
01:16:54,120 --> 01:16:55,340
Just think about it.

1893
01:16:55,900 --> 01:16:59,660
It literally takes like five games to get a rookie if you're in Pred.

1894
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:01,400
If you're a Pred player.

1895
01:17:05,460 --> 01:17:06,540
All right, Niko.

1896
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:07,920
Take us home.

1897
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:09,600
Niko?

1898
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:12,320
Niko?

1899
01:17:17,100 --> 01:17:17,960
Niko, come on.

1900
01:17:19,740 --> 01:17:21,420
Haha, I rejoined at the right?

1901
01:17:22,040 --> 01:17:23,300
We're dropping Among Us.

1902
01:17:23,420 --> 01:17:24,320
We're dropping Among Us.

1903
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:25,900
Don't worry, I believe in us.

1904
01:17:25,980 --> 01:17:26,760
You played Among Us?

1905
01:17:26,840 --> 01:17:27,760
You were an Among Us player.

1906
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:31,260
Where's your professional?

1907
01:17:31,300 --> 01:17:33,100
You were in all those streamer lobbies.

1908
01:17:33,180 --> 01:17:34,380
Yeah, that's right.

1909
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:37,080
That's Miss Gumiho, the Among Us player.

1910
01:17:38,280 --> 01:17:38,720
Yeah.

1911
01:17:38,760 --> 01:17:41,800
Yeah, she was in all those Among Us lobbies.

1912
01:17:41,900 --> 01:17:43,160
Yeah, I know her.

1913
01:17:43,320 --> 01:17:44,620
Oh, triple take!

1914
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:47,000
Yeah.

1915
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:48,520
She was like...

1916
01:17:49,180 --> 01:17:50,240
Yeah, I know her.

1917
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:51,360
She was like in the...

1918
01:17:51,420 --> 01:17:53,180
Disguised Toast lobbies.

1919
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:55,480
She was a pretty big deal.

1920
01:17:55,980 --> 01:17:56,880
Oh, hello, Sia.

1921
01:17:57,680 --> 01:17:58,160
Rookie!

1922
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:02,380
Wait, were you actually in the Toast lobbies though?

1923
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:04,820
No, man.

1924
01:18:04,940 --> 01:18:06,060
I was in the Hafu lobbies.

1925
01:18:06,240 --> 01:18:07,280
Oh, you're in the Hafu lobbies.

1926
01:18:07,300 --> 01:18:09,160
Yeah, she was in the Hafu lobbies.

1927
01:18:09,540 --> 01:18:11,000
She's a pretty big deal.

1928
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:13,680
Knocked one.

1929
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:15,180
Where's his teammate though?

1930
01:18:19,660 --> 01:18:20,140
Teammates?

1931
01:18:20,140 --> 01:18:20,880
Oh, shit.

1932
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:22,060
I told you!

1933
01:18:22,120 --> 01:18:23,460
Look, they're all rookies!

1934
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:25,560
Because they all start rookies.

1935
01:18:26,700 --> 01:18:28,160
Hey, purple backpack here.

1936
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:28,880
Oh, nice.

1937
01:18:29,540 --> 01:18:31,120
Better take it before Nico does.

1938
01:18:31,480 --> 01:18:32,160
Oh, pinged it.

1939
01:18:32,300 --> 01:18:33,780
He respects pings, right?

1940
01:18:34,380 --> 01:18:35,340
Where's their third though?

1941
01:18:36,420 --> 01:18:37,080
Oh, no.

1942
01:18:38,340 --> 01:18:39,060
Oh, fuck.

1943
01:18:41,340 --> 01:18:42,760
They don't have a third player?

1944
01:18:44,580 --> 01:18:45,580
Apparently they do.

1945
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:48,720
Did they run already?

1946
01:18:50,460 --> 01:18:50,980
Already?

1947
01:18:52,100 --> 01:18:53,720
Please, I have zero kills.

1948
01:18:54,380 --> 01:18:55,900
I don't wanna be joining.

1949
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:56,460
I don't wanna be joining.

1950
01:19:00,680 --> 01:19:01,200
Hello?

1951
01:19:01,720 --> 01:19:03,060
I guess he ran off.

1952
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:05,720
Okay, okay.

1953
01:19:05,980 --> 01:19:06,740
Oh, wait, I heard someone.

1954
01:19:07,080 --> 01:19:07,180
Where?

1955
01:19:08,760 --> 01:19:09,280
No!

1956
01:19:10,180 --> 01:19:11,400
I couldn't farm.

1957
01:19:11,720 --> 01:19:13,240
You should like let me tap it.

1958
01:19:14,360 --> 01:19:16,580
Well, that wasn't me who did that.

1959
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:17,860
Fucking Nico.

1960
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:22,280
We should kick him out.

1961
01:19:22,860 --> 01:19:23,380
Yeah.

1962
01:19:24,160 --> 01:19:25,400
I think so too.

1963
01:19:25,700 --> 01:19:26,180
Hahaha.

1964
01:19:29,160 --> 01:19:30,500
Lesson number one.

1965
01:19:30,900 --> 01:19:32,220
Always let us tap.

1966
01:19:34,240 --> 01:19:35,620
Hold on, don't say it like that.

1967
01:19:35,860 --> 01:19:36,400
Hahaha.

1968
01:19:37,300 --> 01:19:37,860
Hahaha.

1969
01:19:40,520 --> 01:19:41,300
Hold on.

1970
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:44,260
Wait a minute.

1971
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:46,020
I didn't sign up for this.

1972
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:46,800
I...

1973
01:19:51,300 --> 01:19:53,660
Okay, Nico.

1974
01:19:53,880 --> 01:19:54,620
IGLS.

1975
01:19:55,800 --> 01:19:56,780
IGLS, Nico.

1976
01:20:02,540 --> 01:20:03,200
IGLS.

1977
01:20:03,540 --> 01:20:04,960
Tell us what to do.

1978
01:20:06,460 --> 01:20:07,120
Wait.

1979
01:20:07,500 --> 01:20:08,400
He's leaving.

1980
01:20:08,740 --> 01:20:11,140
Wait, Digi doesn't go to R9 anymore?

1981
01:20:11,480 --> 01:20:13,220
It goes to shotgun and...

1982
01:20:13,220 --> 01:20:13,720
What?

1983
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:17,280
I didn't know that.

1984
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:20,620
You don't use Digi on R9...

1985
01:20:20,620 --> 01:20:21,360
on like...

1986
01:20:21,880 --> 01:20:22,740
R9 anymore.

1987
01:20:23,880 --> 01:20:25,000
What the fuck did that happen?

1988
01:20:26,740 --> 01:20:27,700
Non-SMGs.

1989
01:20:28,100 --> 01:20:28,120
Wow!

1990
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:29,180
A bow!

1991
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:33,800
Nico, don't call yourself the Mama Duck ever again.

1992
01:20:34,040 --> 01:20:34,360
Yeah.

1993
01:20:34,600 --> 01:20:35,380
That's cringe.

1994
01:20:36,380 --> 01:20:37,840
That's pretty fucking cringe.

1995
01:20:38,060 --> 01:20:38,100
Hahaha.

1996
01:20:40,580 --> 01:20:42,320
That's fucking cringe, man.

1997
01:20:42,380 --> 01:20:43,380
I'm cringing right now.

1998
01:20:43,680 --> 01:20:44,540
I'm cringing.

1999
01:20:45,720 --> 01:20:47,580
God, typically PxClare.

2000
01:20:47,860 --> 01:20:48,180
Wait, where?

2001
01:20:49,260 --> 01:20:50,780
I used it in no direction, Nico.

2002
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,500
I wish we could melee boost.

2003
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:55,520
I missed that.

2004
01:20:55,820 --> 01:20:56,580
Oh shit.

2005
01:20:56,880 --> 01:20:59,240
You just punched the shit out of me.

2006
01:20:59,820 --> 01:21:00,460
What?

2007
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:04,760
I mean, if you consented...

2008
01:21:04,760 --> 01:21:05,260
Um...

2009
01:21:05,260 --> 01:21:05,760
Hahaha.

2010
01:21:08,480 --> 01:21:10,280
I mean, that's what you're into.

2011
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:13,440
Oh!

2012
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:18,660
Remember, you have white armor.

2013
01:21:19,260 --> 01:21:19,320
Hahaha.

2014
01:21:20,780 --> 01:21:20,880
Woah!

2015
01:21:21,440 --> 01:21:21,720
Hahaha.

2016
01:21:25,420 --> 01:21:25,980
Um...

2017
01:21:25,980 --> 01:21:27,640
Wait, there's another team over there.

2018
01:21:28,040 --> 01:21:28,300
Uh?

2019
01:21:30,200 --> 01:21:30,960
I'm busy.

2020
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:34,300
Wait, I'm scaled now.

2021
01:21:36,380 --> 01:21:37,740
They're all white armor.

2022
01:21:38,220 --> 01:21:39,220
I'm gonna ult this.

2023
01:21:43,480 --> 01:21:44,360
Am I ult?

2024
01:21:48,240 --> 01:21:49,900
They're like, up on the rock.

2025
01:21:51,380 --> 01:21:52,080
Cracked him?

2026
01:21:53,540 --> 01:21:54,440
One on here.

2027
01:21:55,040 --> 01:21:55,720
All dead?

2028
01:21:56,980 --> 01:21:57,420
Nice.

2029
01:21:58,120 --> 01:22:00,460
Alright, I'm just pushing up then.

2030
01:22:01,400 --> 01:22:02,840
Oh shit, look at all these boxes.

2031
01:22:02,940 --> 01:22:03,280
Nice.

2032
01:22:04,220 --> 01:22:05,660
I'm gonna grab this real fast.

2033
01:22:06,620 --> 01:22:07,620
Will you guys be okay?

2034
01:22:08,920 --> 01:22:10,100
I'm looting, I'm looting.

2035
01:22:10,140 --> 01:22:10,860
This is important.

2036
01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:12,640
What?

2037
01:22:14,620 --> 01:22:16,180
This is more important than...

2038
01:22:16,180 --> 01:22:17,160
Oh shit, Nico!

2039
01:22:17,360 --> 01:22:17,900
Okay, I'm coming over.

2040
01:22:20,040 --> 01:22:20,780
Alright, don't worry.

2041
01:22:23,540 --> 01:22:24,380
I should...

2042
01:22:24,380 --> 01:22:24,840
I should...

2043
01:22:24,860 --> 01:22:25,640
Level up myself.

2044
01:22:26,120 --> 01:22:27,920
Nico, if you don't get him!

2045
01:22:28,440 --> 01:22:30,100
Why I... Why I oughta...

2046
01:22:30,100 --> 01:22:30,580
There you go.

2047
01:22:31,420 --> 01:22:32,560
Is there anything, buddy?

2048
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:34,240
Is there people in front of us?

2049
01:22:34,360 --> 01:22:35,640
Cause I'm looting, I'm looting.

2050
01:22:37,260 --> 01:22:37,760
No.

2051
01:22:38,620 --> 01:22:39,120
Nice.

2052
01:22:39,300 --> 01:22:39,740
Nico!

2053
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:42,300
Are you not res?

2054
01:22:42,520 --> 01:22:44,320
What is going on?

2055
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:46,740
What's going on?

2056
01:22:48,420 --> 01:22:48,920
Nothing.

2057
01:22:49,660 --> 01:22:50,160
Nice.

2058
01:22:50,460 --> 01:22:51,240
Look at that.

2059
01:22:51,240 --> 01:22:52,500
I contributed.

2060
01:22:54,360 --> 01:22:55,580
I'm gonna push forward.

2061
01:22:55,720 --> 01:22:57,380
And see if there's people in front of us.

2062
01:22:57,540 --> 01:22:57,680
Oh!

2063
01:22:57,980 --> 01:22:58,420
Oh!

2064
01:22:58,440 --> 01:22:59,940
There was a Loba ult up there.

2065
01:23:00,220 --> 01:23:01,920
Did they use it?

2066
01:23:02,600 --> 01:23:03,660
Wait, they did.

2067
01:23:03,960 --> 01:23:05,140
They should come down to us.

2068
01:23:05,220 --> 01:23:05,820
Okay, let's just wait.

2069
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:08,100
Yeah, they're here.

2070
01:23:09,120 --> 01:23:10,020
Come on, Loba!

2071
01:23:10,900 --> 01:23:12,540
Oh my god, that poor guy.

2072
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:14,900
Where's his teammate?

2073
01:23:16,760 --> 01:23:17,920
Where's your teammate, Loba?

2074
01:23:18,360 --> 01:23:19,260
It's a team of two.

2075
01:23:19,460 --> 01:23:20,520
White armor and blue armor.

2076
01:23:21,980 --> 01:23:22,580
Tracked him?

2077
01:23:22,680 --> 01:23:22,940
There.

2078
01:23:23,100 --> 01:23:23,580
Good for 50?

2079
01:23:23,720 --> 01:23:24,000
Nice.

2080
01:23:26,060 --> 01:23:26,540
Aww.

2081
01:23:26,940 --> 01:23:27,900
Hello, rookie.

2082
01:23:30,100 --> 01:23:32,700
I wanna stay in this elo forever.

2083
01:23:36,780 --> 01:23:37,780
Isn't that great?

2084
01:23:41,750 --> 01:23:42,490
Here we go.

2085
01:23:45,450 --> 01:23:46,950
Don't even have a redeploy.

2086
01:23:48,510 --> 01:23:51,350
I have a... I hear fighting north side.

2087
01:23:51,570 --> 01:23:51,970
North side?

2088
01:23:52,170 --> 01:23:52,910
Okay, I'm going over.

2089
01:23:53,090 --> 01:23:53,810
Oh yeah, yeah.

2090
01:23:53,830 --> 01:23:55,010
Wait, someone has a Kraber.

2091
01:23:55,730 --> 01:23:56,910
Yeah, they're fighting hard.

2092
01:23:57,050 --> 01:23:57,750
They're fighting hard.

2093
01:23:57,910 --> 01:23:59,910
On me?

2094
01:24:02,470 --> 01:24:02,990
What?

2095
01:24:04,290 --> 01:24:04,810
Down?

2096
01:24:05,070 --> 01:24:05,710
Left side?

2097
01:24:05,770 --> 01:24:05,990
Left side?

2098
01:24:08,630 --> 01:24:10,630
Oh, careful of the fucking...

2099
01:24:10,630 --> 01:24:11,650
ball of fire.

2100
01:24:12,350 --> 01:24:13,410
Wait, what?

2101
01:24:14,170 --> 01:24:14,810
Oh, nice.

2102
01:24:17,690 --> 01:24:18,210
Flash?

2103
01:24:21,560 --> 01:24:22,240
I'm worried.

2104
01:24:22,240 --> 01:24:23,920
I think they're gonna rez my kill.

2105
01:24:25,700 --> 01:24:26,200
Pushing up.

2106
01:24:26,500 --> 01:24:27,080
Hit 53.

2107
01:24:27,580 --> 01:24:27,900
Flash?

2108
01:24:30,160 --> 01:24:30,720
In front of me?

2109
01:24:30,860 --> 01:24:31,200
I'm pushing.

2110
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:33,960
There's an ult in front of me, so I can't push.

2111
01:24:34,900 --> 01:24:35,500
Careful, Goomy.

2112
01:24:35,620 --> 01:24:36,080
You're by yourself.

2113
01:24:37,700 --> 01:24:38,380
Yeah, I'm killing.

2114
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:38,740
Flash?

2115
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:40,260
They have a bow check or something.

2116
01:24:40,420 --> 01:24:40,640
They're fine.

2117
01:24:40,700 --> 01:24:40,980
They're dead.

2118
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:41,220
They're dead.

2119
01:24:41,380 --> 01:24:41,820
Off the river.

2120
01:24:41,940 --> 01:24:42,160
There's him.

2121
01:24:45,940 --> 01:24:46,260
Nice.

2122
01:24:50,140 --> 01:24:50,740
Where's the...

2123
01:24:50,740 --> 01:24:51,980
Oh, Niko.

2124
01:24:53,020 --> 01:24:53,340
Dead.

2125
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:55,360
Okay, there was another team over there earlier.

2126
01:24:55,780 --> 01:24:57,320
Yeah, I think they rez my kill.

2127
01:24:57,480 --> 01:24:58,060
I'm pretty sure.

2128
01:24:59,700 --> 01:25:00,960
I'm pretty sure they rez'd it.

2129
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:03,960
Let's see.

2130
01:25:04,040 --> 01:25:05,920
Oh, I can regen on my heals now.

2131
01:25:06,280 --> 01:25:06,560
Yippee!

2132
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:08,540
And loot.

2133
01:25:08,660 --> 01:25:09,240
I love loot.

2134
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:11,400
Oh, in front of me?

2135
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:11,740
In front of me?

2136
01:25:13,400 --> 01:25:14,720
And they're fighting to my left.

2137
01:25:15,780 --> 01:25:16,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2138
01:25:16,840 --> 01:25:17,340
Right here?

2139
01:25:19,900 --> 01:25:20,480
I'm pushing.

2140
01:25:21,940 --> 01:25:22,660
I'm medding.

2141
01:25:24,980 --> 01:25:25,880
Oh my god.

2142
01:25:26,840 --> 01:25:27,780
Oh, he's one.

2143
01:25:28,660 --> 01:25:29,960
I fucked up my aim there.

2144
01:25:31,180 --> 01:25:32,480
There's a guy behind this box.

2145
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:32,980
That's low.

2146
01:25:34,020 --> 01:25:34,820
Or he healed.

2147
01:25:35,480 --> 01:25:36,880
There's a guy right behind this too.

2148
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:40,380
Oh, nice.

2149
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:40,980
They got the kill.

2150
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:44,100
There's a team with blue armor.

2151
01:25:45,060 --> 01:25:46,020
Yeah, it's just a Seer.

2152
01:25:47,260 --> 01:25:48,860
There's a team on my right as well.

2153
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:51,980
We should be fine.

2154
01:25:53,400 --> 01:25:53,800
Yeah.

2155
01:25:53,800 --> 01:25:55,720
I think we have to go to zone soon though.

2156
01:25:56,120 --> 01:25:56,500
You know what?

2157
01:25:56,820 --> 01:25:57,420
Fuck you.

2158
01:25:57,680 --> 01:25:57,900
Are they rez'ing?

2159
01:26:00,100 --> 01:26:01,220
Alright, I'm finishing.

2160
01:26:04,100 --> 01:26:04,500
Nice.

2161
01:26:06,680 --> 01:26:07,680
I made a statement.

2162
01:26:09,160 --> 01:26:10,940
I think there's like people in front of me though.

2163
01:26:11,720 --> 01:26:12,640
I'm right behind you.

2164
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:13,860
Yeah, there's a rez.

2165
01:26:15,260 --> 01:26:15,960
Rez in front.

2166
01:26:18,860 --> 01:26:19,220
Woah!

2167
01:26:20,240 --> 01:26:21,020
I'm ulting.

2168
01:26:22,040 --> 01:26:22,740
Pushing this.

2169
01:26:24,220 --> 01:26:25,840
This is like non-stop fighting.

2170
01:26:26,040 --> 01:26:26,780
I love this elo.

2171
01:26:27,420 --> 01:26:28,680
I'm gonna ult myself.

2172
01:26:29,060 --> 01:26:29,920
Can't push anymore.

2173
01:26:30,640 --> 01:26:31,680
Yeah, I saw that.

2174
01:26:32,900 --> 01:26:34,380
Shut it, but I forgot.

2175
01:26:35,080 --> 01:26:36,340
Look, I forgot.

2176
01:26:38,600 --> 01:26:40,160
They just ran.

2177
01:26:40,380 --> 01:26:41,940
Look, they're just running away.

2178
01:26:44,660 --> 01:26:45,520
Not fair.

2179
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:46,900
Do we have redeploy?

2180
01:26:49,240 --> 01:26:49,720
Redeploy.

2181
01:26:51,420 --> 01:26:53,040
I spelled redeploy wrong.

2182
01:26:54,160 --> 01:26:54,640
Redeploy.

2183
01:26:54,700 --> 01:26:55,180
Now!

2184
01:26:58,080 --> 01:26:59,220
Where's our redeploy?

2185
01:27:02,920 --> 01:27:04,640
Nico, you literally have redeploy!

2186
01:27:08,940 --> 01:27:10,080
Oh my god.

2187
01:27:10,120 --> 01:27:11,240
God damn it, Nico.

2188
01:27:13,200 --> 01:27:13,680
Okay.

2189
01:27:13,880 --> 01:27:15,060
We need to go to zone though.

2190
01:27:15,720 --> 01:27:16,620
Yeah, they went up.

2191
01:27:16,840 --> 01:27:17,780
Yeah, they have high ground.

2192
01:27:18,860 --> 01:27:19,420
I'm pushing up.

2193
01:27:19,420 --> 01:27:20,180
Nico, it's all your fault.

2194
01:27:20,360 --> 01:27:21,080
This is all your fault.

2195
01:27:21,160 --> 01:27:21,840
I said redeploy.

2196
01:27:22,500 --> 01:27:24,180
I said one simple word.

2197
01:27:24,940 --> 01:27:26,840
You didn't say that.

2198
01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:27,680
I heard it.

2199
01:27:27,780 --> 01:27:28,760
Yeah, I heard it too.

2200
01:27:29,580 --> 01:27:30,640
We all heard it.

2201
01:27:31,180 --> 01:27:32,220
Yep, we all heard it.

2202
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:36,980
I'm gonna take the Bonsai platform.

2203
01:27:39,160 --> 01:27:40,260
Deploy or kick.

2204
01:27:42,580 --> 01:27:43,580
Oh, there he is.

2205
01:27:47,660 --> 01:27:48,740
There's his teammate though.

2206
01:27:51,560 --> 01:27:52,980
What's your real rank?

2207
01:27:53,320 --> 01:27:56,160
Mr. Mr. Loba.

2208
01:27:57,200 --> 01:27:58,700
Can I farm you?

2209
01:27:59,500 --> 01:28:00,020
Let's see.

2210
01:28:01,580 --> 01:28:02,360
Go Nico.

2211
01:28:02,480 --> 01:28:04,380
Tell us what their rank is if they can shoot you.

2212
01:28:08,930 --> 01:28:10,410
Won't know if they can aim.

2213
01:28:11,570 --> 01:28:12,770
I'm gonna go to the right.

2214
01:28:17,220 --> 01:28:17,740
Knocked?

2215
01:28:18,340 --> 01:28:21,400
What the fuck are they doing?

2216
01:28:22,220 --> 01:28:22,740
Flush?

2217
01:28:24,380 --> 01:28:24,900
Oh.

2218
01:28:24,980 --> 01:28:25,560
He's dead.

2219
01:28:26,320 --> 01:28:26,780
Goodbye!

2220
01:28:27,780 --> 01:28:28,800
There he is.

2221
01:28:28,900 --> 01:28:29,780
He's gone.

2222
01:28:29,900 --> 01:28:30,380
It's fine.

2223
01:28:33,540 --> 01:28:35,780
That is not my ult, by the way.

2224
01:28:35,960 --> 01:28:39,960
That could be a different team's ult.

2225
01:28:46,160 --> 01:28:47,020
I need ammo.

2226
01:28:47,080 --> 01:28:48,320
No land energy?

2227
01:28:49,320 --> 01:28:49,780
Fuck.

2228
01:28:51,120 --> 01:28:52,440
Where's the other guy we killed?

2229
01:28:53,820 --> 01:28:56,060
I can drop you 16 energy right here.

2230
01:28:56,280 --> 01:28:56,820
Yeah, I need it.

2231
01:28:57,040 --> 01:28:57,800
There's a new team.

2232
01:28:59,040 --> 01:28:59,540
In front of us.

2233
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:01,920
Now you're not fighting.

2234
01:29:02,340 --> 01:29:03,640
Yeah, we're literally right in front.

2235
01:29:04,240 --> 01:29:04,840
Hard fighting?

2236
01:29:07,060 --> 01:29:07,460
Oh!

2237
01:29:09,720 --> 01:29:10,120
40?

2238
01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:11,800
Sorry, I don't know if it's 40.

2239
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:12,520
I made up the number.

2240
01:29:13,080 --> 01:29:13,480
Okay.

2241
01:29:16,140 --> 01:29:16,960
Oh, look at him go!

2242
01:29:19,080 --> 01:29:19,480
Flush?

2243
01:29:23,180 --> 01:29:24,100
I'm just gonna...

2244
01:29:24,100 --> 01:29:25,780
Yeah, I'm gonna fucking head to zone.

2245
01:29:26,480 --> 01:29:27,020
Oh, hey!

2246
01:29:27,480 --> 01:29:28,080
What's that?

2247
01:29:29,040 --> 01:29:29,200
Ah!

2248
01:29:29,700 --> 01:29:30,300
You didn't get it?

2249
01:29:30,740 --> 01:29:31,220
No.

2250
01:29:31,480 --> 01:29:32,360
Alright, I'll take it.

2251
01:29:32,460 --> 01:29:33,360
I was running out anyway.

2252
01:29:35,460 --> 01:29:37,220
I was running out of ammo.

2253
01:29:38,320 --> 01:29:39,160
Might as well.

2254
01:29:40,580 --> 01:29:41,360
Wait, what?

2255
01:29:41,880 --> 01:29:42,900
He needed us.

2256
01:29:44,640 --> 01:29:45,460
Who is it?

2257
01:29:46,740 --> 01:29:47,220
Oh!

2258
01:29:47,260 --> 01:29:48,100
There was an Urskan.

2259
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:49,280
Uh.

2260
01:29:49,880 --> 01:29:51,840
Was it you or Niko that punched me?

2261
01:29:52,600 --> 01:29:53,780
Look where I am.

2262
01:29:54,920 --> 01:29:56,460
Like, what do you think?

2263
01:29:56,460 --> 01:29:58,900
I'm so far from you.

2264
01:29:59,540 --> 01:30:01,060
We need to go to zone though.

2265
01:30:01,560 --> 01:30:02,160
I don't know.

2266
01:30:02,300 --> 01:30:03,340
Alright, I'm heading down.

2267
01:30:06,710 --> 01:30:07,770
Super in zone!

2268
01:30:09,290 --> 01:30:10,150
Super Niko.

2269
01:30:10,630 --> 01:30:12,150
Let Niko... No!

2270
01:30:12,750 --> 01:30:15,790
If he was a real gamer, he would have a fucking bottle.

2271
01:30:18,490 --> 01:30:19,950
That's called the streamer life.

2272
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:26,300
What do you mean great about...

2273
01:30:27,580 --> 01:30:29,000
Next merch idea.

2274
01:30:32,580 --> 01:30:33,900
The gamer bottle.

2275
01:30:35,620 --> 01:30:36,080
Eww.

2276
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:45,600
Where the fuck are...

2277
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:47,400
There's still like three teams left.

2278
01:30:47,480 --> 01:30:47,960
Where are they?

2279
01:30:48,680 --> 01:30:51,180
Yeah, go for it.

2280
01:30:51,640 --> 01:30:52,100
Really?

2281
01:30:54,200 --> 01:30:55,140
What do you mean no?

2282
01:30:55,320 --> 01:30:58,640
If he was a real gamer, he'd hold it in.

2283
01:30:58,920 --> 01:30:59,940
Or get a bottle.

2284
01:31:02,520 --> 01:31:03,900
Only real gamers know.

2285
01:31:04,080 --> 01:31:06,080
Oh, wait there's two next to us.

2286
01:31:06,380 --> 01:31:07,360
There's two above us.

2287
01:31:10,480 --> 01:31:11,400
They just rest.

2288
01:31:12,440 --> 01:31:13,680
Where the fuck is the...

2289
01:31:13,680 --> 01:31:15,640
No, there's two like right next to us somewhere.

2290
01:31:17,060 --> 01:31:18,060
Wait, that's a...

2291
01:31:18,060 --> 01:31:18,860
There's one right above me.

2292
01:31:21,080 --> 01:31:23,340
Are they like...

2293
01:31:23,340 --> 01:31:24,240
Up top?

2294
01:31:24,240 --> 01:31:24,480
Oh, yeah!

2295
01:31:30,250 --> 01:31:30,730
Tracking?

2296
01:31:31,110 --> 01:31:31,590
Okay.

2297
01:31:33,070 --> 01:31:33,910
Last guy.

2298
01:31:36,610 --> 01:31:38,050
He's like literally one guy.

2299
01:31:42,670 --> 01:31:43,370
Oh, army?

2300
01:31:45,230 --> 01:31:45,830
Cracked him?

2301
01:31:46,750 --> 01:31:48,010
Cracked the bloodhound?

2302
01:31:48,590 --> 01:31:49,450
In front of us?

2303
01:31:54,550 --> 01:31:55,150
Cracked him?

2304
01:31:55,630 --> 01:31:56,070
Not?

2305
01:31:58,210 --> 01:31:58,830
Cracked him?

2306
01:31:58,990 --> 01:31:59,490
He's cracked.

2307
01:32:02,930 --> 01:32:04,990
Okay, but I'm not letting this guy res though.

2308
01:32:05,270 --> 01:32:06,950
Okay, but I'm not letting this guy res though.

2309
01:32:08,630 --> 01:32:09,070
Cracked?

2310
01:32:09,070 --> 01:32:09,390
Okay, I'm gonna go back.

2311
01:32:09,490 --> 01:32:11,690
Is this the last guy?

2312
01:32:11,890 --> 01:32:12,090
Yeah!

2313
01:32:12,770 --> 01:32:14,090
I told you!

2314
01:32:14,390 --> 01:32:18,890
I told you rank is so easy to farm.

2315
01:32:19,310 --> 01:32:21,410
It's easier to farm than fucking pause.

2316
01:32:22,330 --> 01:32:25,310
I told you so easy.

2317
01:32:25,770 --> 01:32:27,150
What the fuck?

2318
01:32:28,510 --> 01:32:29,170
What the fuck?

2319
01:32:29,170 --> 01:32:29,930
Oh, god!

2320
01:32:30,510 --> 01:32:33,110
Oh, god!

2321
01:32:33,110 --> 01:32:34,130
Now what happened?

2322
01:32:34,290 --> 01:32:34,850
My screen.

2323
01:32:38,330 --> 01:32:39,210
Oh, yeah.

2324
01:32:39,410 --> 01:32:39,850
Nice.

2325
01:32:40,270 --> 01:32:42,730
Turns out the triple wasn't that epic.

2326
01:32:42,790 --> 01:32:43,170
Oh, yeah.

2327
01:32:43,190 --> 01:32:44,650
The triple take is nerfed as hell.

2328
01:32:46,510 --> 01:32:48,410
Dude, they just don't want me to play this game.

2329
01:32:49,490 --> 01:32:50,110
Oh, my god.

2330
01:32:50,130 --> 01:32:51,950
How many points did we gain there?

2331
01:32:53,610 --> 01:32:54,050
425.

2332
01:32:54,050 --> 01:32:54,990
I told you!

2333
01:32:55,050 --> 01:32:59,790
It literally takes like 4-5 games for a player to get out a rookie.

2334
01:32:59,970 --> 01:33:00,850
It literally takes like 4-5 games for a player to get out a rookie.

2335
01:33:00,850 --> 01:33:01,330
For literally rookie 3.

2336
01:33:01,570 --> 01:33:01,590
For literally rookie 3.

2337
01:33:01,590 --> 01:33:05,090
Oh, my god.

2338
01:33:05,290 --> 01:33:07,230
It was a legendary frame.

2339
01:33:07,670 --> 01:33:08,470
It was a legendary frame.

2340
01:33:08,470 --> 01:33:13,290
It literally took us like one game to get to rookie... almost to rookie 2.

2341
01:33:13,950 --> 01:33:16,150
Please, I wanna stay in rookie forever.

2342
01:33:16,550 --> 01:33:17,850
Please, it's so fun.

2343
01:33:18,570 --> 01:33:19,590
It's like OG.

2344
01:33:20,690 --> 01:33:21,810
OG pubs.

2345
01:33:23,170 --> 01:33:23,950
It's okay.

2346
01:33:24,150 --> 01:33:25,430
He can like speedrun.

2347
01:33:26,210 --> 01:33:27,190
He's a man.

2348
01:33:37,260 --> 01:33:37,960
It's alright.

2349
01:33:38,120 --> 01:33:38,820
Look at that!

2350
01:33:38,980 --> 01:33:39,760
Gumi, we did it!

2351
01:33:39,780 --> 01:33:40,140
We won!

2352
01:33:41,800 --> 01:33:43,860
Are you proud of us?

2353
01:33:44,400 --> 01:33:45,720
Yeah, I'm proud.

2354
01:33:49,710 --> 01:33:51,050
We did it!

2355
01:33:51,310 --> 01:33:51,910
Yay!

2356
01:33:53,750 --> 01:33:54,430
Yippee!

2357
01:33:55,250 --> 01:33:55,930
Yay!

2358
01:33:59,610 --> 01:34:02,230
Are you gonna let Nico join the voice chat?

2359
01:34:02,430 --> 01:34:03,230
Girls only!

2360
01:34:05,330 --> 01:34:07,050
No men allowed!

2361
01:34:07,950 --> 01:34:08,630
Yeah!

2362
01:34:09,430 --> 01:34:10,690
My game crashed.

2363
01:34:11,530 --> 01:34:12,010
Oh, my god.

2364
01:34:13,530 --> 01:34:14,890
Oh, my god.

2365
01:34:17,130 --> 01:34:19,250
Guys, I don't think my game...

2366
01:34:19,250 --> 01:34:23,630
My only thing my game likes is that I restricted the voice chat.

2367
01:34:27,280 --> 01:34:29,510
Let me put my game back up.

2368
01:34:34,330 --> 01:34:34,970
It's okay.

2369
01:34:35,110 --> 01:34:35,570
It's okay.

2370
01:34:35,950 --> 01:34:36,990
I'm coming back.

2371
01:34:38,530 --> 01:34:39,430
I'm coming.

2372
01:34:39,430 --> 01:34:41,570
Nico is literally not dropping us.

2373
01:34:41,610 --> 01:34:42,670
I think he also crashed.

2374
01:34:42,690 --> 01:34:45,130
No, he's using the bathroom right now.

2375
01:34:45,410 --> 01:34:46,410
He's using...

2376
01:34:47,330 --> 01:34:50,210
Dude, I can't leave or else it...

2377
01:34:50,830 --> 01:34:51,450
I'm back!

2378
01:34:51,570 --> 01:34:51,870
I'm back!

2379
01:34:51,870 --> 01:34:52,390
I'm back!

2380
01:34:52,430 --> 01:34:52,750
I'm back!

2381
01:34:53,010 --> 01:34:53,470
Really?

2382
01:34:53,770 --> 01:34:54,230
Really?

2383
01:34:55,430 --> 01:34:57,690
The game was like, rise up, men.

2384
01:35:00,390 --> 01:35:02,490
Men, don't let her talk about us like this.

2385
01:35:02,770 --> 01:35:03,990
Men, don't let her talk about us like this.

2386
01:35:03,990 --> 01:35:04,570
There's someone!

2387
01:35:06,610 --> 01:35:07,270
It's okay.

2388
01:35:07,370 --> 01:35:08,010
Just kill him.

2389
01:35:08,870 --> 01:35:09,870
What are you afraid of?

2390
01:35:10,470 --> 01:35:10,910
Oh!

2391
01:35:11,170 --> 01:35:13,850
Gumi, Gumi, what happened?

2392
01:35:13,990 --> 01:35:14,270
Gumi, what happened?

2393
01:35:14,750 --> 01:35:15,650
What do you mean?

2394
01:35:16,030 --> 01:35:20,070
I think these guys are gamers now.

2395
01:35:20,210 --> 01:35:21,430
They're not regular rookies.

2396
01:35:23,890 --> 01:35:25,310
They're not regular rookie players.

2397
01:35:25,450 --> 01:35:26,650
Oh, I don't have frames right now.

2398
01:35:27,610 --> 01:35:28,050
Woo!

2399
01:35:28,850 --> 01:35:29,290
Woo!

2400
01:35:30,170 --> 01:35:32,010
There's another team.

2401
01:35:33,310 --> 01:35:34,570
There's another team.

2402
01:35:36,190 --> 01:35:37,150
That's why we don't let Nico.

2403
01:35:37,850 --> 01:35:38,950
That's why we don't let Nico.

2404
01:35:38,950 --> 01:35:39,310
This is Nico's fault.

2405
01:35:40,170 --> 01:35:40,570
Yeah.

2406
01:35:41,190 --> 01:35:41,970
I blame Nico.

2407
01:35:44,870 --> 01:35:45,810
I blame Nico.

2408
01:35:45,970 --> 01:35:46,490
Yeah, Nico just got owned.

2409
01:35:46,550 --> 01:35:47,470
What's wrong with you, Nico?

2410
01:35:47,610 --> 01:35:48,450
Yeah, what's wrong with you?

2411
01:35:49,610 --> 01:35:50,010
Anyways.

2412
01:35:51,690 --> 01:35:52,610
What's wrong with you, Nico?

2413
01:35:52,630 --> 01:35:53,250
This is your fault.

2414
01:35:53,430 --> 01:35:54,890
Oh, he has teammates?!

2415
01:35:59,070 --> 01:36:03,570
You know, if I had teammates, I wouldn't have died.

2416
01:36:08,350 --> 01:36:09,730
My rookie boys!

2417
01:36:11,450 --> 01:36:12,210
I'm good.

2418
01:36:12,310 --> 01:36:13,210
I'm good now.

2419
01:36:16,430 --> 01:36:16,990
Okay.

2420
01:36:17,210 --> 01:36:19,010
Look, we blame Nico, right?

2421
01:36:20,090 --> 01:36:20,650
Yeah.

2422
01:36:20,650 --> 01:36:21,210
Yeah.

2423
01:36:21,730 --> 01:36:25,410
He doesn't have a voice, so we can blame him.

2424
01:36:29,770 --> 01:36:31,510
No, there's no MMR!

2425
01:36:31,790 --> 01:36:33,470
We just landed somewhere.

2426
01:36:33,470 --> 01:36:35,870
That had actual good players.

2427
01:36:36,230 --> 01:36:37,490
Oh, we're on trios.

2428
01:36:37,730 --> 01:36:39,110
Wait, were we not in rank?

2429
01:36:39,410 --> 01:36:39,750
Were we?

2430
01:36:40,010 --> 01:36:40,870
No, we were.

2431
01:36:42,270 --> 01:36:42,790
No!

2432
01:36:43,070 --> 01:36:43,590
Gooby!

2433
01:36:45,430 --> 01:36:47,070
Gooby, take us back!

2434
01:36:48,250 --> 01:36:50,250
Take us back to rank!

2435
01:36:50,350 --> 01:36:51,930
It was so much more fun!

2436
01:36:53,210 --> 01:36:53,890
My bad.

2437
01:36:54,010 --> 01:36:55,010
I went to go get a shumai.

2438
01:36:55,270 --> 01:36:55,890
Oh, nice.

2439
01:36:55,970 --> 01:36:56,570
How is it?

2440
01:36:57,190 --> 01:36:57,950
It's cold.

2441
01:36:59,210 --> 01:36:59,730
Nice.

2442
01:36:59,770 --> 01:37:00,290
Not nice.

2443
01:37:00,290 --> 01:37:02,690
Just as for Nico.

2444
01:37:04,970 --> 01:37:06,770
Let him speak.

2445
01:37:09,330 --> 01:37:12,670
Dude, I don't wanna hear it.

2446
01:37:14,470 --> 01:37:21,850
If he wanted to talk to us, he could have used the open VC in the game.

2447
01:37:24,050 --> 01:37:24,470
Right?

2448
01:37:24,610 --> 01:37:27,170
What's stopping him from using that?

2449
01:37:28,450 --> 01:37:29,290
Exactly.

2450
01:37:29,490 --> 01:37:29,950
Yeah.

2451
01:37:30,290 --> 01:37:33,970
Honestly, even if Nico were here, do you think he could talk over us?

2452
01:37:34,270 --> 01:37:35,290
Do you hear us?

2453
01:37:37,690 --> 01:37:38,250
True.

2454
01:37:38,490 --> 01:37:38,870
True.

2455
01:37:39,330 --> 01:37:41,090
I don't even hear my own thoughts.

2456
01:37:45,290 --> 01:37:47,030
Let Nico speak.

2457
01:37:54,330 --> 01:37:56,650
This Goomyho, the real Goomyho.

2458
01:37:56,750 --> 01:37:59,590
Yes, the among us Minecraft Goomyho.

2459
01:38:01,050 --> 01:38:01,930
And Valorant.

2460
01:38:02,510 --> 01:38:04,310
Can we change how you introduce me?

2461
01:38:05,450 --> 01:38:06,330
Oh, sorry.

2462
01:38:06,490 --> 01:38:07,550
The Minecrafter.

2463
01:38:07,570 --> 01:38:08,470
Is that...

2464
01:38:08,470 --> 01:38:09,250
Is that...

2465
01:38:13,590 --> 01:38:14,490
My game crashed.

2466
01:38:14,750 --> 01:38:16,350
Are you fucking kidding me?

2467
01:38:16,810 --> 01:38:22,230
I guess we gotta swap to Mel right now.

2468
01:38:22,510 --> 01:38:24,150
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2469
01:38:24,730 --> 01:38:26,130
No, no, no, no, no, no.

2470
01:38:26,130 --> 01:38:26,750
Give me a sec.

2471
01:38:26,830 --> 01:38:27,530
I'm coming back.

2472
01:38:27,530 --> 01:38:29,410
I'm coming back right now.

2473
01:38:30,270 --> 01:38:31,250
Give me a sec.

2474
01:38:32,950 --> 01:38:33,850
Okay, here we go.

2475
01:38:34,990 --> 01:38:35,450
Nice.

2476
01:38:35,530 --> 01:38:35,790
Okay.

2477
01:38:36,330 --> 01:38:38,290
Alright, for some reason it's windowed now.

2478
01:38:38,430 --> 01:38:39,070
That's not great.

2479
01:38:40,950 --> 01:38:42,670
I don't know why I keep crashing.

2480
01:38:43,570 --> 01:38:44,330
See, Fae?

2481
01:38:44,390 --> 01:38:47,370
Every Apex update fucks up the PC.

2482
01:38:47,790 --> 01:38:48,790
One way or another.

2483
01:38:51,150 --> 01:38:52,850
Okay, just don't let me die.

2484
01:38:53,090 --> 01:38:53,550
Please.

2485
01:38:55,770 --> 01:38:57,510
Nico's landing is just one spot away.

2486
01:38:57,510 --> 01:38:57,910
Okay.

2487
01:38:58,250 --> 01:39:00,830
Let me make sure we're not windowed.

2488
01:39:02,390 --> 01:39:03,350
Alright, I'm good.

2489
01:39:04,070 --> 01:39:06,370
I'm gonna have shit frames for one second.

2490
01:39:10,050 --> 01:39:10,650
Uhhh...

2491
01:39:11,330 --> 01:39:12,870
We don't have people contesting us.

2492
01:39:13,050 --> 01:39:13,530
No.

2493
01:39:13,790 --> 01:39:15,210
No, they're far.

2494
01:39:16,730 --> 01:39:17,330
Okay.

2495
01:39:18,270 --> 01:39:19,030
Want that?

2496
01:39:19,950 --> 01:39:20,730
Shitty gun.

2497
01:39:23,710 --> 01:39:25,110
She's special to me!

2498
01:39:25,510 --> 01:39:28,410
Yeah, but it's old and shitty now.

2499
01:39:30,010 --> 01:39:32,050
It's like you're talking about me trippin'.

2500
01:39:35,050 --> 01:39:37,290
That's why you love the triple take, right?

2501
01:39:39,370 --> 01:39:39,890
Hey.

2502
01:39:40,830 --> 01:39:41,350
Hey.

2503
01:39:41,830 --> 01:39:42,350
Hey.

2504
01:39:42,850 --> 01:39:43,370
Hey.

2505
01:39:43,670 --> 01:39:45,130
What the fuck?

2506
01:39:46,330 --> 01:39:48,410
Hey, you taught me everything I know about looting.

2507
01:39:49,150 --> 01:39:50,310
What the fuck?

2508
01:39:51,010 --> 01:39:54,270
Hey, I can kick you out right now if I want.

2509
01:39:56,110 --> 01:39:56,830
Do it.

2510
01:39:57,510 --> 01:39:58,010
Oh yeah?

2511
01:39:58,010 --> 01:39:59,030
You think I won't?

2512
01:39:59,250 --> 01:40:00,250
I'll go take a nap.

2513
01:40:00,490 --> 01:40:01,530
You think I won't?

2514
01:40:01,530 --> 01:40:02,490
You think I won't?

2515
01:40:07,240 --> 01:40:08,000
Yeah, that's right.

2516
01:40:08,200 --> 01:40:09,200
Don't test me.

2517
01:40:10,100 --> 01:40:12,220
I'll take Nico away from you right now.

2518
01:40:12,620 --> 01:40:14,360
Girl, I don't want him.

2519
01:40:19,760 --> 01:40:20,700
What the fuck?

2520
01:40:20,740 --> 01:40:22,100
Don't say that in front of chat!

2521
01:40:23,500 --> 01:40:24,160
Don't say that in front of chat!

2522
01:40:24,160 --> 01:40:26,220
Dude, you shouldn't even ask what his age was!

2523
01:40:26,540 --> 01:40:28,480
Is he sad?

2524
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:29,480
What?

2525
01:40:33,960 --> 01:40:35,900
You can't blame me on that.

2526
01:40:36,100 --> 01:40:38,360
You can't blame me on that.

2527
01:40:38,540 --> 01:40:39,580
You raised them.

2528
01:40:39,760 --> 01:40:41,060
You raised them.

2529
01:40:41,260 --> 01:40:42,680
You raised them.

2530
01:40:42,680 --> 01:40:44,880
Look, I wouldn't say raised them.

2531
01:40:44,980 --> 01:40:49,900
It's more like I gave them an iPad and let them go wild.

2532
01:40:50,280 --> 01:40:50,440
Oh, okay.

2533
01:40:50,540 --> 01:40:52,100
Yeah, you know, they're iPad kids.

2534
01:40:52,220 --> 01:40:52,820
Oh, shit!

2535
01:40:53,640 --> 01:40:54,120
Nico!

2536
01:40:54,600 --> 01:40:55,740
Okay, okay.

2537
01:40:55,780 --> 01:40:58,300
I was not paying attention.

2538
01:40:59,480 --> 01:41:00,260
Did he flash?

2539
01:41:02,220 --> 01:41:02,700
What?

2540
01:41:03,340 --> 01:41:04,640
Hey, I'm getting sniped.

2541
01:41:06,060 --> 01:41:06,660
Oh, fuck.

2542
01:41:06,960 --> 01:41:07,440
Sorry.

2543
01:41:07,880 --> 01:41:08,960
I slid.

2544
01:41:09,200 --> 01:41:10,040
That was...

2545
01:41:10,620 --> 01:41:12,540
No, no, no, that's fine.

2546
01:41:12,560 --> 01:41:13,020
That's fine.

2547
01:41:13,080 --> 01:41:13,680
Nico's got this.

2548
01:41:15,240 --> 01:41:16,640
Please, Nico, don't die.

2549
01:41:18,240 --> 01:41:18,720
Cocomelon!

2550
01:41:18,720 --> 01:41:19,200
Cocomelon!

2551
01:41:19,400 --> 01:41:20,020
Give me iPad!

2552
01:41:20,460 --> 01:41:20,940
Cocomelon!

2553
01:41:22,200 --> 01:41:22,680
Flash.

2554
01:41:23,620 --> 01:41:24,280
It's fine.

2555
01:41:24,380 --> 01:41:25,520
We got... Nico's got...

2556
01:41:25,520 --> 01:41:26,680
Nico literally 1v2'd.

2557
01:41:26,700 --> 01:41:27,040
Let's go.

2558
01:41:28,180 --> 01:41:28,860
Let's go.

2559
01:41:29,480 --> 01:41:31,400
I literally flashed one and did 50.

2560
01:41:31,940 --> 01:41:32,820
Flash it up.

2561
01:41:33,360 --> 01:41:34,120
It's fine.

2562
01:41:34,220 --> 01:41:35,060
He 1v2'd.

2563
01:41:36,320 --> 01:41:37,000
Oh, well.

2564
01:41:37,100 --> 01:41:37,780
My loot now.

2565
01:41:40,740 --> 01:41:41,300
Nice.

2566
01:41:41,520 --> 01:41:42,260
Look, see?

2567
01:41:42,560 --> 01:41:43,760
Nothing to worry about.

2568
01:41:45,840 --> 01:41:47,060
Oh, that's another squad.

2569
01:41:48,420 --> 01:41:49,880
Doki, give me Cocomelon!

2570
01:41:50,840 --> 01:41:51,400
What?

2571
01:41:52,520 --> 01:41:53,080
Cocomelon!

2572
01:41:53,080 --> 01:41:54,620
No, that's gonna damage your brain!

2573
01:41:54,820 --> 01:41:56,200
That's gonna damage your cognitive!

2574
01:41:57,500 --> 01:41:58,060
Cocomelon!

2575
01:41:59,480 --> 01:42:00,060
Don't you know that?

2576
01:42:00,580 --> 01:42:02,540
Cocomelon fucks up your cognitive brain!

2577
01:42:02,980 --> 01:42:03,680
Also, I got one.

2578
01:42:03,800 --> 01:42:04,700
I got rusty loot.

2579
01:42:04,780 --> 01:42:05,700
Loot whatever is new.

2580
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:06,680
That's another one.

2581
01:42:06,800 --> 01:42:07,200
48.

2582
01:42:07,340 --> 01:42:07,680
Flash.

2583
01:42:08,200 --> 01:42:08,780
On me?

2584
01:42:12,120 --> 01:42:13,360
There's like two teams here.

2585
01:42:15,640 --> 01:42:16,600
What the fuck?

2586
01:42:16,980 --> 01:42:18,480
I think they like, rez'd.

2587
01:42:21,260 --> 01:42:23,060
There's like, still two teams though.

2588
01:42:27,250 --> 01:42:28,390
Does anyone have energy?

2589
01:42:28,390 --> 01:42:30,110
They raze portal.

2590
01:42:30,290 --> 01:42:30,930
Oh, okay.

2591
01:42:31,710 --> 01:42:33,050
There's a second team then.

2592
01:42:33,910 --> 01:42:35,810
Oh my god, he fucking crazy.

2593
01:42:36,170 --> 01:42:37,110
I'm just gonna grab this.

2594
01:42:37,230 --> 01:42:37,530
Oh, behind us!

2595
01:42:37,990 --> 01:42:40,130
Oh, nice.

2596
01:42:40,250 --> 01:42:40,450
Okay.

2597
01:42:41,590 --> 01:42:42,770
I couldn't get him.

2598
01:42:43,810 --> 01:42:45,070
Wait, he's gonna take the zip?

2599
01:42:47,070 --> 01:42:48,490
I think he's gonna get it.

2600
01:42:49,190 --> 01:42:50,410
Wait, in front of me?

2601
01:42:51,030 --> 01:42:51,570
Bloodhound scan?

2602
01:42:53,910 --> 01:42:54,350
Behind?

2603
01:42:54,770 --> 01:42:55,050
Right here?

2604
01:42:56,090 --> 01:42:56,530
Flash?

2605
01:42:59,350 --> 01:43:00,190
I'm shielding.

2606
01:43:01,130 --> 01:43:02,110
Oh my god.

2607
01:43:02,650 --> 01:43:03,750
Oh, I'm bliffing!

2608
01:43:05,590 --> 01:43:06,230
It's fine!

2609
01:43:06,310 --> 01:43:06,870
Dead, dead, dead, dead!

2610
01:43:07,010 --> 01:43:07,950
One more, one more, one more!

2611
01:43:09,070 --> 01:43:09,730
New team.

2612
01:43:10,830 --> 01:43:11,270
Crap.

2613
01:43:13,010 --> 01:43:13,850
Jesus Christ.

2614
01:43:13,950 --> 01:43:15,190
How many teams are there?

2615
01:43:15,910 --> 01:43:17,010
I'm shielding you, quick.

2616
01:43:17,310 --> 01:43:18,190
I need a shield too.

2617
01:43:19,690 --> 01:43:21,290
Oh, there's another team behind me!

2618
01:43:21,290 --> 01:43:21,690
Please!

2619
01:43:21,690 --> 01:43:22,570
I'm going to steal it!

2620
01:43:22,790 --> 01:43:25,790
Okay, I'm leaving.

2621
01:43:25,870 --> 01:43:26,250
I'm sorry.

2622
01:43:31,150 --> 01:43:31,990
I'm gonna heal here.

2623
01:43:38,620 --> 01:43:39,960
There's way too many people.

2624
01:43:41,300 --> 01:43:42,400
There's people on me.

2625
01:43:42,420 --> 01:43:43,500
Yeah, I got shot by all three teams.

2626
01:43:43,520 --> 01:43:43,980
That was crazy.

2627
01:43:45,740 --> 01:43:47,020
I'm trying to figure out where...

2628
01:43:47,020 --> 01:43:48,500
if they're fighting each other now.

2629
01:43:48,680 --> 01:43:49,220
Niko's fighting.

2630
01:43:49,480 --> 01:43:50,240
Niko, no!

2631
01:43:50,320 --> 01:43:50,900
You're crazy!

2632
01:43:53,820 --> 01:43:54,840
Don't be a hero!

2633
01:43:59,140 --> 01:43:59,940
Niko, no!

2634
01:43:59,940 --> 01:44:02,640
Oh my god, he is actually being a hero right now.

2635
01:44:02,680 --> 01:44:03,280
Oh, he's dead.

2636
01:44:05,160 --> 01:44:05,960
Are you safe?

2637
01:44:06,040 --> 01:44:06,740
Are you safe, Niko?

2638
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:08,060
Please speak to me.

2639
01:44:08,180 --> 01:44:08,480
I'm okay.

2640
01:44:08,580 --> 01:44:09,180
Niko is safe.

2641
01:44:09,600 --> 01:44:10,600
No, he's not safe.

2642
01:44:10,780 --> 01:44:12,000
You liar!

2643
01:44:13,560 --> 01:44:14,440
He was!

2644
01:44:14,760 --> 01:44:14,980
He was!

2645
01:44:16,360 --> 01:44:17,800
You fucking liar!

2646
01:44:18,300 --> 01:44:18,980
He literally was!

2647
01:44:19,720 --> 01:44:21,100
I don't know what you're talking about.

2648
01:44:25,800 --> 01:44:27,920
I don't know what you're talking about.

2649
01:44:27,920 --> 01:44:30,460
I can't believe you lied to me like that, Gumi.

2650
01:44:30,900 --> 01:44:31,340
Wait.

2651
01:44:31,620 --> 01:44:32,500
Rank, rank, rank.

2652
01:44:34,260 --> 01:44:35,680
That was definitely not my fault.

2653
01:44:35,960 --> 01:44:37,840
Oh my god, he has a voice!

2654
01:44:38,140 --> 01:44:38,980
What are you doing?

2655
01:44:39,140 --> 01:44:40,460
What are you doing, Niko?

2656
01:44:43,040 --> 01:44:43,480
Sorry.

2657
01:45:04,640 --> 01:45:06,880
Oh my god, you like whipped him.

2658
01:45:07,100 --> 01:45:11,980
What the fuck, boy?

2659
01:45:14,140 --> 01:45:16,340
What the fuck, boy?

2660
01:45:16,420 --> 01:45:17,740
What the fuck, boy?

2661
01:45:18,740 --> 01:45:19,380
Niko, Niko.

2662
01:45:19,380 --> 01:45:21,260
The way he said sorry.

2663
01:45:21,420 --> 01:45:23,020
Oh my god.

2664
01:45:26,860 --> 01:45:27,500
Niko.

2665
01:45:28,840 --> 01:45:30,620
This is your champion.

2666
01:45:30,840 --> 01:45:31,900
What do you mean get ready for a crash?

2667
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,580
I didn't do anything this time!

2668
01:45:36,260 --> 01:45:37,860
That was Gumi!

2669
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:38,440
That was Gumi!

2670
01:45:40,480 --> 01:45:42,780
He will not be silenced.

2671
01:45:45,720 --> 01:45:46,840
Oh my god.

2672
01:45:47,460 --> 01:45:50,260
I think your chat is down bad.

2673
01:45:56,120 --> 01:45:56,960
Alright, Gumi.

2674
01:45:57,080 --> 01:45:57,540
Where are we going?

2675
01:46:00,380 --> 01:46:01,980
Don't make me say it, Niko.

2676
01:46:02,120 --> 01:46:03,280
What the fuck?

2677
01:46:09,300 --> 01:46:10,160
That's right.

2678
01:46:15,060 --> 01:46:17,220
That's why you haven't been promoted in four years.

2679
01:46:17,440 --> 01:46:17,900
Whoa!

2680
01:46:19,560 --> 01:46:21,060
You're still only Niko.

2681
01:46:21,940 --> 01:46:23,320
Wait, what does that mean?

2682
01:46:23,520 --> 01:46:24,780
What does that mean?

2683
01:46:27,240 --> 01:46:29,120
What else would he be called?

2684
01:46:32,300 --> 01:46:35,540
What would he be called if it wasn't Niko?

2685
01:46:36,300 --> 01:46:37,400
There's a guy in the center.

2686
01:46:37,500 --> 01:46:37,940
I don't think we should be around here.

2687
01:46:43,910 --> 01:46:44,830
There's a guy.

2688
01:46:45,030 --> 01:46:48,250
Where the fuck are you?

2689
01:46:48,410 --> 01:46:49,550
Like, main?

2690
01:46:50,270 --> 01:46:51,270
Like, oh...

2691
01:46:51,270 --> 01:46:53,490
Niko and I are underground like, what the fuck?

2692
01:46:54,210 --> 01:46:54,890
Alright.

2693
01:46:56,350 --> 01:46:57,730
There's a team right here.

2694
01:46:58,690 --> 01:47:00,050
I can...

2695
01:47:00,050 --> 01:47:05,440
Where are they?

2696
01:47:06,180 --> 01:47:06,860
Oh.

2697
01:47:08,480 --> 01:47:09,160
Okay.

2698
01:47:10,960 --> 01:47:12,020
Where's his teammate?

2699
01:47:12,900 --> 01:47:13,940
Oh shit!

2700
01:47:14,620 --> 01:47:15,300
Hello.

2701
01:47:15,300 --> 01:47:15,500
Hello.

2702
01:47:15,760 --> 01:47:16,840
Will you guys be fine?

2703
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:19,560
Nice.

2704
01:47:19,920 --> 01:47:21,320
We're fine.

2705
01:47:21,660 --> 01:47:23,460
We might be low health, but that's whatever.

2706
01:47:23,800 --> 01:47:24,740
See if I care.

2707
01:47:26,040 --> 01:47:26,600
See?

2708
01:47:26,800 --> 01:47:27,440
We're okay.

2709
01:47:27,560 --> 01:47:28,680
Nothing to worry about.

2710
01:47:31,560 --> 01:47:33,520
Niko is best girl.

2711
01:47:36,160 --> 01:47:37,920
Wait, then what's Gumi then?

2712
01:47:38,920 --> 01:47:39,760
Wait a second.

2713
01:47:41,520 --> 01:47:42,620
Come on, guys!

2714
01:47:43,840 --> 01:47:45,700
Don't hold yourself.

2715
01:47:46,220 --> 01:47:46,680
Hello?

2716
01:47:47,440 --> 01:47:48,360
Hello?

2717
01:47:48,620 --> 01:47:49,840
What would Gumi be, guys?

2718
01:47:50,380 --> 01:47:50,600
Whoops.

2719
01:47:52,680 --> 01:47:54,560
Ramblin' side chick!

2720
01:47:55,020 --> 01:47:55,420
Yes!

2721
01:48:00,420 --> 01:48:02,780
Gumi the side chick.

2722
01:48:03,140 --> 01:48:04,020
Crazy.

2723
01:48:04,660 --> 01:48:06,480
Gumi is okay.

2724
01:48:07,360 --> 01:48:08,280
Oh.

2725
01:48:08,900 --> 01:48:10,340
Oh god.

2726
01:48:10,340 --> 01:48:12,480
Oh my god.

2727
01:48:12,600 --> 01:48:13,840
You're just okay.

2728
01:48:14,280 --> 01:48:15,440
How does that make you feel?

2729
01:48:16,500 --> 01:48:17,940
I'm single.

2730
01:48:23,160 --> 01:48:25,640
Gumi, I think you're getting a little desperate.

2731
01:48:26,560 --> 01:48:27,120
I'm lying!

2732
01:48:27,540 --> 01:48:28,200
I'm lying!

2733
01:48:28,540 --> 01:48:29,100
Yeah?

2734
01:48:31,820 --> 01:48:33,200
There's a team over there.

2735
01:48:33,880 --> 01:48:35,500
The side character.

2736
01:48:36,180 --> 01:48:39,100
Holy fuck.

2737
01:48:39,520 --> 01:48:41,680
Gumi, you're getting fucking roasted right now.

2738
01:48:41,820 --> 01:48:42,520
Holy fuck.

2739
01:48:43,340 --> 01:48:43,620
You're kidding.

2740
01:48:44,100 --> 01:48:44,960
I didn't want that.

2741
01:48:45,860 --> 01:48:47,340
There's a team to my right as well.

2742
01:48:47,720 --> 01:48:49,700
I don't know if it's two teams or not.

2743
01:48:49,880 --> 01:48:50,820
I didn't hear the...

2744
01:48:52,940 --> 01:48:53,780
They EMP'd me.

2745
01:48:53,860 --> 01:48:54,360
I'm so fucked.

2746
01:48:55,500 --> 01:48:56,520
I'm backing up fully.

2747
01:48:56,780 --> 01:48:58,600
I don't want to deal with...

2748
01:49:01,160 --> 01:49:02,280
I'm going to high ground.

2749
01:49:04,120 --> 01:49:04,920
What the fuck?

2750
01:49:04,940 --> 01:49:05,580
Niko got a car.

2751
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:07,500
What the?

2752
01:49:07,540 --> 01:49:08,400
He's pulling up into whip!

2753
01:49:09,760 --> 01:49:11,120
What the fuck is going on?

2754
01:49:12,840 --> 01:49:14,460
I'm going to heal real fast though.

2755
01:49:18,500 --> 01:49:20,260
I don't know if it's like...

2756
01:49:20,260 --> 01:49:20,960
Wait, what?

2757
01:49:21,140 --> 01:49:22,620
Why are they crafting?

2758
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:25,520
In the middle of the fight.

2759
01:49:27,100 --> 01:49:27,920
One's over here.

2760
01:49:28,440 --> 01:49:29,960
Yeah, I'm going to heal real fast.

2761
01:49:30,480 --> 01:49:30,920
One's here.

2762
01:49:33,440 --> 01:49:34,740
You know what?

2763
01:49:34,820 --> 01:49:35,180
Fuck this.

2764
01:49:35,240 --> 01:49:35,580
I'm ulting.

2765
01:49:36,400 --> 01:49:36,880
Okay.

2766
01:49:37,620 --> 01:49:38,580
Oh, they're running.

2767
01:49:38,680 --> 01:49:39,060
Oh, they're running.

2768
01:49:40,600 --> 01:49:41,100
Oh, they're running.

2769
01:49:41,100 --> 01:49:42,120
Wait, what the fuck?

2770
01:49:42,120 --> 01:49:42,580
That guy is flesh.

2771
01:49:42,960 --> 01:49:44,300
Yeah, that guy to my right.

2772
01:49:45,260 --> 01:49:46,180
Oh, another team.

2773
01:49:46,180 --> 01:49:48,640
He has white armor though.

2774
01:49:49,900 --> 01:49:50,920
This is two teams.

2775
01:49:58,560 --> 01:49:59,020
Ooh.

2776
01:50:01,820 --> 01:50:02,280
Careful.

2777
01:50:03,640 --> 01:50:04,560
I'm killing.

2778
01:50:05,500 --> 01:50:06,260
Backing fully.

2779
01:50:08,840 --> 01:50:11,460
Because we're surrounded right now.

2780
01:50:11,780 --> 01:50:13,280
I'm going to fall back to this building.

2781
01:50:13,360 --> 01:50:14,340
Yeah, let's fall back to the roof.

2782
01:50:19,060 --> 01:50:19,420
Alright.

2783
01:50:19,580 --> 01:50:22,760
Gonna have to slowly crawl up.

2784
01:50:22,780 --> 01:50:24,360
You do have to get to the zone kind of soon.

2785
01:50:24,380 --> 01:50:25,120
I have a redeploy.

2786
01:50:26,040 --> 01:50:27,200
Oh yeah, we gotta go to the zone.

2787
01:50:27,400 --> 01:50:28,140
Yeah, we can just redeploy.

2788
01:50:28,380 --> 01:50:29,240
We don't have to be here.

2789
01:50:30,020 --> 01:50:30,780
I'm going to put it down.

2790
01:50:32,180 --> 01:50:32,540
Alright.

2791
01:50:32,780 --> 01:50:33,580
Bye guys.

2792
01:50:34,620 --> 01:50:35,660
You guys can fight in the zone.

2793
01:50:35,660 --> 01:50:36,640
What the fuck do you mean bye guys?

2794
01:50:37,420 --> 01:50:39,520
The two teams that are fighting over there?

2795
01:50:39,580 --> 01:50:40,260
What the fuck do you mean?

2796
01:50:40,660 --> 01:50:41,840
I have abandonment issues!

2797
01:50:43,340 --> 01:50:44,880
Don't we... That's why we play Apex.

2798
01:50:45,720 --> 01:50:46,540
Where are you going?

2799
01:50:50,020 --> 01:50:51,540
I'm taking this redeploy.

2800
01:50:51,660 --> 01:50:54,380
We can literally fight them here.

2801
01:50:57,140 --> 01:51:00,460
Why did you take another redeploy?

2802
01:51:00,540 --> 01:51:00,800
Why did you take another redeploy?

2803
01:51:00,800 --> 01:51:01,560
I guess it was.

2804
01:51:06,820 --> 01:51:08,680
Oh shit, he's sniping.

2805
01:51:09,440 --> 01:51:11,020
Everyone's a fucking critic I guess.

2806
01:51:11,440 --> 01:51:12,680
I need like...

2807
01:51:12,680 --> 01:51:14,040
I need like...

2808
01:51:15,280 --> 01:51:16,300
Shields if you have any.

2809
01:51:16,520 --> 01:51:17,300
They're in the plicky!

2810
01:51:19,960 --> 01:51:21,160
I'm gonna throw...

2811
01:51:21,160 --> 01:51:22,400
I'm gonna throw...

2812
01:51:22,400 --> 01:51:24,160
Wait, he's dead.

2813
01:51:25,220 --> 01:51:26,700
I'm gonna go for that kill.

2814
01:51:26,940 --> 01:51:28,180
Cause I'm gonna rob him.

2815
01:51:29,320 --> 01:51:31,020
It's okay, I'm gonna rob this man.

2816
01:51:32,100 --> 01:51:32,520
Ew.

2817
01:51:34,320 --> 01:51:35,360
Oh shit!

2818
01:51:35,600 --> 01:51:36,000
Yes!

2819
01:51:36,940 --> 01:51:37,460
Um...

2820
01:51:38,540 --> 01:51:41,940
Okay, I did not expect him to have fucking teammates.

2821
01:51:43,240 --> 01:51:44,580
Oh, they're on the building!

2822
01:51:45,060 --> 01:51:46,240
Wait, they stole our building?

2823
01:51:46,240 --> 01:51:48,140
Another notch on the belt.

2824
01:51:49,520 --> 01:51:51,360
Okay, we're good.

2825
01:51:52,220 --> 01:51:53,260
Okay, we're good.

2826
01:51:53,260 --> 01:51:54,240
Why is there on me?

2827
01:51:54,940 --> 01:51:55,740
I'm heading over.

2828
01:51:55,980 --> 01:51:57,760
I hear a crip- Oh, my game crashed!

2829
01:51:58,100 --> 01:51:58,560
No!

2830
01:51:59,160 --> 01:52:01,600
Okay, you guys went fine.

2831
01:52:01,740 --> 01:52:02,440
Just don't die.

2832
01:52:03,680 --> 01:52:04,640
I'm not dying?

2833
01:52:05,300 --> 01:52:06,780
Just don't die.

2834
01:52:07,760 --> 01:52:08,780
What do you mean?

2835
01:52:09,180 --> 01:52:10,600
Okay, this is Apex update.

2836
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:11,780
No, please tell me.

2837
01:52:11,800 --> 01:52:12,340
Am I still alive?

2838
01:52:12,340 --> 01:52:14,160
Am I still alive?

2839
01:52:16,040 --> 01:52:17,460
I'm coming back in!

2840
01:52:18,520 --> 01:52:19,900
Oh god, I swear.

2841
01:52:20,140 --> 01:52:21,680
This Apex...

2842
01:52:21,680 --> 01:52:22,880
What do you mean deserved?

2843
01:52:23,580 --> 01:52:25,500
I fucking... I was clutching it!

2844
01:52:25,560 --> 01:52:26,520
I saved everybody!

2845
01:52:28,460 --> 01:52:30,740
Apex doesn't want me to win.

2846
01:52:31,420 --> 01:52:32,060
No!

2847
01:52:32,820 --> 01:52:34,020
Let me win!

2848
01:52:34,940 --> 01:52:36,620
I was doing too well!

2849
01:52:40,080 --> 01:52:40,860
I'm alive.

2850
01:52:41,040 --> 01:52:41,480
I...

2851
01:52:42,340 --> 01:52:43,000
I was so far!

2852
01:52:45,040 --> 01:52:45,900
Goobie, stay alive!

2853
01:52:46,300 --> 01:52:47,240
Stay alive for me!

2854
01:52:47,320 --> 01:52:47,940
We're all alive.

2855
01:52:48,040 --> 01:52:49,200
We literally killed them all.

2856
01:52:49,400 --> 01:52:49,880
Oh, nice.

2857
01:52:50,080 --> 01:52:50,600
I knew it.

2858
01:52:50,680 --> 01:52:51,220
I was there.

2859
01:52:51,880 --> 01:52:52,320
What?

2860
01:52:53,280 --> 01:52:55,100
I was moral support.

2861
01:52:59,560 --> 01:53:00,080
Don't worry.

2862
01:53:00,140 --> 01:53:00,500
Stay alive.

2863
01:53:00,920 --> 01:53:01,500
Don't worry.

2864
01:53:01,620 --> 01:53:02,180
I'm coming back.

2865
01:53:03,580 --> 01:53:04,460
I'm coming back.

2866
01:53:05,760 --> 01:53:06,840
We're all alive!

2867
01:53:08,400 --> 01:53:09,000
Don't worry!

2868
01:53:12,760 --> 01:53:13,800
Just don't die!

2869
01:53:15,920 --> 01:53:19,140
I swear to god, please don't kick me out for a third time.

2870
01:53:21,060 --> 01:53:21,780
Come on.

2871
01:53:24,060 --> 01:53:24,740
I'm here!

2872
01:53:25,460 --> 01:53:26,400
Don't worry guys!

2873
01:53:26,620 --> 01:53:27,500
I'm here now!

2874
01:53:27,660 --> 01:53:29,780
And my game is freaking the fuck out!

2875
01:53:29,900 --> 01:53:30,320
I'm good.

2876
01:53:32,120 --> 01:53:32,640
Nice.

2877
01:53:34,580 --> 01:53:36,500
Oh my god.

2878
01:53:36,840 --> 01:53:39,060
My game is freaking the fuck out.

2879
01:53:39,180 --> 01:53:40,140
Wait, did you guys kill everything?

2880
01:53:40,140 --> 01:53:40,420
Woah!

2881
01:53:43,140 --> 01:53:45,240
Okay, as long as I don't look down, we're fine.

2882
01:53:45,780 --> 01:53:46,260
Woah!

2883
01:53:47,340 --> 01:53:47,940
Oh hey.

2884
01:53:52,200 --> 01:53:52,920
Everything's okay.

2885
01:53:56,440 --> 01:53:57,120
Everything's okay.

2886
01:53:57,220 --> 01:53:57,340
Everything's okay now.

2887
01:53:57,760 --> 01:53:58,440
Wait, what?

2888
01:53:58,620 --> 01:53:59,380
Wait, behind me?

2889
01:53:59,580 --> 01:54:01,420
Oh, I can't look behind me!

2890
01:54:01,820 --> 01:54:02,300
No!

2891
01:54:02,480 --> 01:54:04,800
I'm so fucking nerfed right now!

2892
01:54:06,160 --> 01:54:07,620
I can't look behind!

2893
01:54:07,840 --> 01:54:09,560
They need to fight in front of me!

2894
01:54:10,200 --> 01:54:11,680
They need to fight in front of me!

2895
01:54:12,840 --> 01:54:13,280
I...

2896
01:54:14,800 --> 01:54:15,320
That's one.

2897
01:54:18,460 --> 01:54:19,440
Walk backward!

2898
01:54:20,440 --> 01:54:21,840
I can't see!

2899
01:54:26,620 --> 01:54:27,060
No!

2900
01:54:27,660 --> 01:54:29,000
You guys can't kill him, right?

2901
01:54:29,600 --> 01:54:30,700
Don't worry, I'm coming over.

2902
01:54:32,620 --> 01:54:35,360
Don't worry, if I walk in the sideways, we'll be fine.

2903
01:54:36,860 --> 01:54:37,440
Don't worry.

2904
01:54:38,340 --> 01:54:39,260
We killed them.

2905
01:54:39,340 --> 01:54:40,540
We killed two of them.

2906
01:54:40,820 --> 01:54:41,060
Okay.

2907
01:54:41,480 --> 01:54:44,820
I just need to hope that every enemy shoots in front of me.

2908
01:54:44,880 --> 01:54:45,060
Okay.

2909
01:54:45,060 --> 01:54:45,060
I just need to hope that every enemy shoots in front of me.

2910
01:54:45,080 --> 01:54:46,500
Then we should be fine.

2911
01:54:46,580 --> 01:54:48,640
As long as they're all in front of me.

2912
01:54:50,360 --> 01:54:51,120
Oh god.

2913
01:54:51,540 --> 01:54:52,680
Oh god.

2914
01:54:55,320 --> 01:54:56,680
Oh, this is not great.

2915
01:54:57,560 --> 01:54:59,860
Oh, this is not great for me.

2916
01:55:00,200 --> 01:55:01,360
This is not...

2917
01:55:01,360 --> 01:55:03,000
I don't feel so well.

2918
01:55:07,040 --> 01:55:07,760
It's okay.

2919
01:55:07,840 --> 01:55:12,120
As long as the enemies are in front of me, and I never look behind me, we'll be fine.

2920
01:55:14,300 --> 01:55:15,060
Rhea, this is so...

2921
01:55:15,080 --> 01:55:16,520
This simulation is breaking.

2922
01:55:17,180 --> 01:55:19,060
Doki, we're going behind you.

2923
01:55:19,500 --> 01:55:20,300
Wait, no!

2924
01:55:20,960 --> 01:55:22,520
No, you're not supposed to!

2925
01:55:22,640 --> 01:55:23,720
I can't function!

2926
01:55:24,740 --> 01:55:25,180
Woo!

2927
01:55:29,140 --> 01:55:30,060
There's people in front of me.

2928
01:55:30,420 --> 01:55:31,280
Let's kill this team.

2929
01:55:31,540 --> 01:55:31,980
Easily.

2930
01:55:34,420 --> 01:55:35,460
Wait, where did he go?

2931
01:55:36,040 --> 01:55:36,720
Was it solo?

2932
01:55:37,620 --> 01:55:39,240
Did I freak out over a solo?

2933
01:55:40,560 --> 01:55:42,220
I think I freaked out over a solo.

2934
01:55:43,820 --> 01:55:45,060
Oh yeah, that's...

2935
01:55:45,080 --> 01:55:45,320
That's a rat.

2936
01:55:47,140 --> 01:55:50,760
Okay, as long as I'm looking in this general direction, we'll be fine.

2937
01:55:51,700 --> 01:55:52,100
What?

2938
01:55:52,440 --> 01:55:54,160
Yeah, my textures will be fine.

2939
01:55:55,180 --> 01:55:55,940
In front of me?

2940
01:56:00,200 --> 01:56:02,260
Oh my god, look at him fucking go.

2941
01:56:06,790 --> 01:56:07,910
Splash if you can kill him.

2942
01:56:07,950 --> 01:56:12,190
You go kill him, Nico and I are gonna go kill this other team.

2943
01:56:12,350 --> 01:56:12,890
He did what you did!

2944
01:56:13,010 --> 01:56:14,630
He made him right behind him!

2945
01:56:16,050 --> 01:56:17,130
I told you!

2946
01:56:17,130 --> 01:56:18,030
It's a good distraction!

2947
01:56:21,770 --> 01:56:22,630
There's people on me.

2948
01:56:23,030 --> 01:56:23,490
Wait, what?

2949
01:56:24,990 --> 01:56:25,690
There's people up there.

2950
01:56:25,790 --> 01:56:26,230
I'm back.

2951
01:56:26,390 --> 01:56:26,850
It's okay.

2952
01:56:28,910 --> 01:56:30,590
It's not zoned though, but...

2953
01:56:31,090 --> 01:56:31,950
Wait, I can look again!

2954
01:56:32,330 --> 01:56:32,970
I can look!

2955
01:56:34,450 --> 01:56:35,150
Fall as well.

2956
01:56:35,730 --> 01:56:37,230
Oh my god, I can look behind me.

2957
01:56:38,150 --> 01:56:38,510
Here?

2958
01:56:38,630 --> 01:56:39,070
Where I'm looking?

2959
01:56:40,790 --> 01:56:41,430
Where I'm peeing?

2960
01:56:42,130 --> 01:56:42,490
Yeah.

2961
01:56:43,990 --> 01:56:44,850
I'm going to the right.

2962
01:56:47,130 --> 01:56:48,290
Cause they have to run from zone.

2963
01:56:48,450 --> 01:56:50,450
Oh, actually they're going all the way bottom.

2964
01:56:51,870 --> 01:56:52,450
Wait, on me?

2965
01:56:57,020 --> 01:56:57,900
It's a squad of three.

2966
01:56:59,440 --> 01:57:01,420
But where does... whose squad is he from?

2967
01:57:01,540 --> 01:57:02,760
Oh no, I can't look behind!

2968
01:57:05,120 --> 01:57:06,140
I thought you were all better!

2969
01:57:06,260 --> 01:57:06,700
What happened?

2970
01:57:06,820 --> 01:57:07,200
I don't know!

2971
01:57:07,280 --> 01:57:07,940
I got sick again!

2972
01:57:11,340 --> 01:57:12,600
That's how getting sick works!

2973
01:57:12,920 --> 01:57:14,660
You don't just magically get better overnight!

2974
01:57:19,580 --> 01:57:20,860
Alright, don't worry, I'm okay now.

2975
01:57:21,400 --> 01:57:21,960
Nico, no!

2976
01:57:23,040 --> 01:57:23,640
No!

2977
01:57:23,860 --> 01:57:24,360
I'm dead.

2978
01:57:25,160 --> 01:57:25,460
No!

2979
01:57:25,500 --> 01:57:26,380
I'm dead!

2980
01:57:27,620 --> 01:57:30,220
2-1, 2-1, 2-1!

2981
01:57:30,960 --> 01:57:33,020
2-1, 2-1, 2-1!

2982
01:57:33,020 --> 01:57:33,100
Dude!

2983
01:57:33,100 --> 01:57:36,820
Hey, do you want to reset your game?

2984
01:57:36,900 --> 01:57:38,220
Yeah, I'm going to reset my game!

2985
01:57:41,120 --> 01:57:43,680
Not being able to look backwards was pretty rough.

2986
01:57:43,840 --> 01:57:44,820
Not going to lie.

2987
01:57:45,160 --> 01:57:47,940
I'm going to reset that shit real fast.

2988
01:57:50,640 --> 01:57:51,240
I'm going to reset that shit real fast.

2989
01:57:51,980 --> 01:57:53,760
I can only look one way.

2990
01:57:54,900 --> 01:57:55,840
Alright, no, no.

2991
01:57:56,120 --> 01:57:56,340
Alright.

2992
01:57:56,920 --> 01:57:58,340
We end with another win.

2993
01:57:58,560 --> 01:57:59,660
Do you think we do it, Gumi?

2994
01:58:01,380 --> 01:58:01,900
Oh?

2995
01:58:01,980 --> 01:58:02,580
What'd you say?

2996
01:58:02,860 --> 01:58:04,180
We can get a win, right?

2997
01:58:04,880 --> 01:58:05,720
Yeah, for sure.

2998
01:58:06,040 --> 01:58:07,960
Check drivers?

2999
01:58:08,340 --> 01:58:08,860
No!

3000
01:58:09,800 --> 01:58:12,560
Because I'm too lazy to restart my PC.

3001
01:58:16,580 --> 01:58:19,080
Just want to play video games.

3002
01:58:20,540 --> 01:58:23,900
I just want to hang out and play video games.

3003
01:58:25,380 --> 01:58:26,660
I invite me.

3004
01:58:29,120 --> 01:58:30,820
Yes, ma'am.

3005
01:58:30,820 --> 01:58:31,380
That's me.

3006
01:58:32,920 --> 01:58:34,420
Oh, we're rookie two.

3007
01:58:34,780 --> 01:58:35,900
Come on, we can win.

3008
01:58:38,200 --> 01:58:39,820
We need to win.

3009
01:58:43,440 --> 01:58:45,120
Plug in roller.

3010
01:58:45,420 --> 01:58:46,760
Plug in roller.

3011
01:58:46,760 --> 01:58:46,900
Plug in roller.

3012
01:58:47,980 --> 01:58:49,000
Plug in roller.

3013
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:49,060
Plug in roller.

3014
01:58:53,550 --> 01:58:54,850
No way you just said that.

3015
01:58:54,930 --> 01:58:55,250
I agree though.

3016
01:59:00,700 --> 01:59:01,260
What?

3017
01:59:01,880 --> 01:59:03,660
GPU is literally dying on stream?

3018
01:59:04,020 --> 01:59:05,100
Shh, don't say that.

3019
01:59:05,340 --> 01:59:06,180
He's just shy.

3020
01:59:07,420 --> 01:59:09,960
My GPU has like performance anxiety.

3021
01:59:10,800 --> 01:59:11,820
Don't say that.

3022
01:59:15,040 --> 01:59:19,980
The more you judge my GPU, the more it's going to freak out.

3023
01:59:26,880 --> 01:59:27,900
The more it's going to freak out.

3024
01:59:28,080 --> 01:59:29,620
Yeah, new PC.

3025
01:59:38,460 --> 01:59:38,940
Doki.

3026
01:59:39,120 --> 01:59:39,600
Yeah?

3027
01:59:41,180 --> 01:59:44,060
For Valentine's Day, can you fly both of us to France?

3028
01:59:44,360 --> 01:59:46,000
And then we can get a croissant or something.

3029
01:59:46,240 --> 01:59:47,120
It's my dog's birthday.

3030
01:59:47,680 --> 01:59:48,820
Why don't you fly over?

3031
01:59:48,920 --> 01:59:49,120
Yeah!

3032
01:59:50,080 --> 01:59:52,940
Why don't you fly over and celebrate my dog's birthday, huh?

3033
01:59:54,400 --> 01:59:55,420
You didn't invite me.

3034
01:59:56,040 --> 01:59:57,140
I'm inviting you now.

3035
01:59:57,440 --> 01:59:57,920
Surprise!

3036
01:59:58,600 --> 01:59:59,080
That's...

3037
02:00:02,620 --> 02:00:03,100
That's...

3038
02:00:04,280 --> 02:00:05,460
Oh my god!

3039
02:00:05,860 --> 02:00:07,320
You ruined the surprise!

3040
02:00:07,980 --> 02:00:09,320
It wasn't going to be a surprise!

3041
02:00:10,140 --> 02:00:11,100
A surprise for who?

3042
02:00:11,320 --> 02:00:11,840
For me?

3043
02:00:12,240 --> 02:00:12,920
Surprise!

3044
02:00:13,980 --> 02:00:15,000
You're invited!

3045
02:00:15,740 --> 02:00:16,480
You're invited!

3046
02:00:21,820 --> 02:00:24,440
You got this GPU, Doki.

3047
02:00:24,500 --> 02:00:25,300
I suppose.

3048
02:00:28,660 --> 02:00:29,340
Done,

3049
02:00:32,940 --> 02:00:33,320
RE.

3050
02:00:34,540 --> 02:00:35,440
You're welcome.

3051
02:00:36,100 --> 02:00:36,700
Wait, is there people here?

3052
02:00:37,700 --> 02:00:38,240
Yep.

3053
02:00:38,600 --> 02:00:40,640
Oh shit, I was not paying attention.

3054
02:00:42,560 --> 02:00:43,300
Where though?

3055
02:00:43,560 --> 02:00:44,240
Are you lying?

3056
02:00:45,160 --> 02:00:46,160
They're near me.

3057
02:00:46,740 --> 02:00:48,040
Are you lying?

3058
02:00:48,420 --> 02:00:49,980
They're literally near me.

3059
02:00:50,600 --> 02:00:51,160
No.

3060
02:00:52,200 --> 02:00:53,940
Okay, actually I believe now.

3061
02:00:54,240 --> 02:00:55,520
That guy might be dead.

3062
02:00:56,580 --> 02:00:57,540
Can I catch one?

3063
02:00:58,060 --> 02:00:59,320
I'm going to help Nico.

3064
02:01:02,140 --> 02:01:02,700
Whoa.

3065
02:01:03,320 --> 02:01:03,880
Crazy.

3066
02:01:04,220 --> 02:01:04,900
Whoa, Nico!

3067
02:01:05,120 --> 02:01:05,340
Nice.

3068
02:01:05,380 --> 02:01:06,480
Here, here's an armor swap.

3069
02:01:06,640 --> 02:01:08,080
There's one, Doki!

3070
02:01:08,220 --> 02:01:08,560
No!

3071
02:01:10,020 --> 02:01:11,000
I'm coming over.

3072
02:01:11,280 --> 02:01:12,220
Oh, you're dead.

3073
02:01:14,460 --> 02:01:15,740
Where are they?

3074
02:01:16,940 --> 02:01:17,500
Um...

3075
02:01:17,500 --> 02:01:18,080
Inside?

3076
02:01:19,880 --> 02:01:22,360
I hear someone above me.

3077
02:01:23,320 --> 02:01:24,540
Aw, he saw me.

3078
02:01:25,700 --> 02:01:27,580
There's someone above me as well.

3079
02:01:27,820 --> 02:01:29,840
So, that's what I'm nervous about.

3080
02:01:31,120 --> 02:01:31,840
So, that's what I'm nervous about.

3081
02:01:32,700 --> 02:01:34,240
My stomach hurts.

3082
02:01:36,460 --> 02:01:37,120
Whoa.

3083
02:01:38,980 --> 02:01:39,640
Whoa!

3084
02:01:39,840 --> 02:01:41,560
Guess I'll have to fucking...

3085
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:43,940
roll in.

3086
02:01:44,640 --> 02:01:45,460
Got you?

3087
02:01:45,980 --> 02:01:47,560
That's the person who killed me.

3088
02:01:48,380 --> 02:01:49,720
Where's his teammate though?

3089
02:01:51,600 --> 02:01:52,260
Um...

3090
02:01:52,260 --> 02:01:53,540
I don't know.

3091
02:01:54,600 --> 02:01:56,460
I heard his teammate nearby.

3092
02:01:56,800 --> 02:01:57,400
Guess not.

3093
02:01:58,840 --> 02:02:02,500
It would be a shame if he just shot me just now.

3094
02:02:08,160 --> 02:02:08,860
What are you doing?

3095
02:02:13,940 --> 02:02:14,760
What is that?

3096
02:02:15,960 --> 02:02:16,660
What is what?

3097
02:02:16,780 --> 02:02:17,220
What is that?

3098
02:02:17,900 --> 02:02:18,560
What is what?

3099
02:02:18,660 --> 02:02:19,200
What is what?

3100
02:02:19,700 --> 02:02:20,680
What is what?

3101
02:02:22,900 --> 02:02:24,020
What is what?

3102
02:02:27,240 --> 02:02:28,120
For free?

3103
02:02:28,460 --> 02:02:28,840
Damn.

3104
02:02:29,280 --> 02:02:29,420
Huh?

3105
02:02:33,160 --> 02:02:33,600
I...

3106
02:02:33,600 --> 02:02:35,540
I got a tiny bit of chippies.

3107
02:02:35,720 --> 02:02:36,360
I got some chippies.

3108
02:02:38,320 --> 02:02:40,240
Dude, I've been recently drinking this drink.

3109
02:02:40,340 --> 02:02:42,560
It's kinda like sody pop, but it's not sody pop.

3110
02:02:42,980 --> 02:02:43,820
Where is it?

3111
02:02:44,400 --> 02:02:47,060
It has like apple cider vinegar inside of it.

3112
02:02:47,160 --> 02:02:47,640
What?

3113
02:02:48,720 --> 02:02:49,420
What's it called?

3114
02:02:51,380 --> 02:02:52,200
Not sponsored!

3115
02:02:52,400 --> 02:02:52,980
Not sponsored!

3116
02:02:57,540 --> 02:02:58,020
Okay.

3117
02:02:58,300 --> 02:02:59,580
But what's it called?

3118
02:03:00,160 --> 02:03:01,220
It's called poppy.

3119
02:03:02,380 --> 02:03:02,860
Poppy?

3120
02:03:02,860 --> 02:03:04,100
P-O-P-P-I.

3121
02:03:04,280 --> 02:03:07,680
It has apple cider vinegar and it's really good for your gut health.

3122
02:03:09,360 --> 02:03:10,160
Are you sure?

3123
02:03:10,320 --> 02:03:11,520
Are you sure you're not sponsored?

3124
02:03:12,740 --> 02:03:13,500
I'm sure.

3125
02:03:13,860 --> 02:03:15,320
I just really like it.

3126
02:03:16,080 --> 02:03:16,920
Oh shit, wait.

3127
02:03:16,980 --> 02:03:17,820
What's in that package?

3128
02:03:18,560 --> 02:03:19,200
I don't know.

3129
02:03:19,260 --> 02:03:20,000
That sounds pretty terrible.

3130
02:03:20,660 --> 02:03:20,680
Thanks, bruv.

3131
02:03:22,440 --> 02:03:24,220
That sounds pretty fucking terrible.

3132
02:03:24,440 --> 02:03:25,420
Vinegar and what?

3133
02:03:26,180 --> 02:03:27,160
Apple cider vinegar?

3134
02:03:27,340 --> 02:03:28,000
You've never had that?

3135
02:03:28,180 --> 02:03:28,500
No.

3136
02:03:28,600 --> 02:03:30,740
Apple cider... I don't like cider in general, to be honest.

3137
02:03:31,940 --> 02:03:33,360
Okay, no.

3138
02:03:33,480 --> 02:03:34,040
It's not...

3139
02:03:34,040 --> 02:03:37,040
It's not cider, nor is it actually vinegar.

3140
02:03:37,220 --> 02:03:37,640
It's like...

3141
02:03:37,640 --> 02:03:39,100
It doesn't taste like it.

3142
02:03:40,540 --> 02:03:41,300
God, winging.

3143
02:03:42,280 --> 02:03:45,000
Wait, what does it taste like?

3144
02:03:45,420 --> 02:03:46,660
It just tastes like...

3145
02:03:46,660 --> 02:03:52,440
You know those fizzy water drinks with a tiny bit of flavored juice?

3146
02:03:52,620 --> 02:03:53,140
Like sparkling water?

3147
02:03:54,100 --> 02:03:57,460
Yeah, except like... But like flavored sparkling water.

3148
02:03:57,820 --> 02:03:58,180
Yeah, yeah.

3149
02:03:58,180 --> 02:03:59,280
Exactly like that.

3150
02:03:59,480 --> 02:04:01,500
I was like, no, it's amazing!

3151
02:04:02,060 --> 02:04:04,920
Alright, how many poppy sponsors are in here right now?

3152
02:04:05,720 --> 02:04:07,940
How many paid bots are on here right now?

3153
02:04:07,940 --> 02:04:08,980
In the chat right now?

3154
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:15,080
It's like anytime you mention poppy, all the poppy bots come into the chat.

3155
02:04:15,220 --> 02:04:16,820
I was like, yeah, it's so good!

I'm gonna be shooting!

3165
02:04:35,020 --> 02:04:35,660
Yes!

3166
02:04:36,020 --> 02:04:37,480
Well, I need to get closer!

3167
02:04:40,660 --> 02:04:41,900
Please don't let me die!

3168
02:04:42,240 --> 02:04:42,480
NICO!

3169
02:04:42,480 --> 02:04:43,940
I'M GONNA KICK YOUR ASS!

3170
02:04:44,320 --> 02:04:44,820
What?

3171
02:04:46,300 --> 02:04:47,680
What's going on?

3172
02:04:47,760 --> 02:04:51,500
I'm fucking shooting them and he's on purpose like, blocking me!

3173
02:04:53,620 --> 02:04:55,220
Standing in front of me!

3174
02:04:58,560 --> 02:04:59,560
That's my all!

3175
02:04:59,780 --> 02:05:00,640
Poppy and bio!

3176
02:05:00,960 --> 02:05:01,820
Poppy and bio!

3177
02:05:01,820 --> 02:05:06,180
Here, I smoked, but it was 100% not gonna help you.

3178
02:05:06,320 --> 02:05:07,660
There's zip lining on your ass!

3179
02:05:07,900 --> 02:05:09,200
There's zip lining on your ass!

3180
02:05:10,920 --> 02:05:11,920
I cracked him.

3181
02:05:12,400 --> 02:05:13,620
That's fucking right, bitch.

3182
02:05:14,700 --> 02:05:15,740
What the fuck?

3183
02:05:16,240 --> 02:05:17,440
I cracked this guy too?

3184
02:05:17,960 --> 02:05:18,940
Cracked an enemy's shield.

3185
02:05:21,200 --> 02:05:21,680
Stupid...

3186
02:05:22,160 --> 02:05:22,640
Clones.

3187
02:05:22,640 --> 02:05:22,980
Up here!

3188
02:05:24,880 --> 02:05:28,060
Yeah, there's two that zipped, but his other teammate redeployed.

3189
02:05:28,220 --> 02:05:29,300
Got company out there!

3190
02:05:30,340 --> 02:05:30,820
Uhh...

3191
02:05:32,140 --> 02:05:33,380
I mean, we can...

3192
02:05:33,380 --> 02:05:35,520
Do we wanna contest their high ground?

3193
02:05:35,760 --> 02:05:36,980
Cause they're just chillin' up there.

3194
02:05:37,120 --> 02:05:38,060
NICO's just looting.

3195
02:05:38,220 --> 02:05:39,980
I mean, to be fair, it's free loot.

3196
02:05:40,540 --> 02:05:41,580
Wait, what the fuck?

3197
02:05:41,760 --> 02:05:42,780
Is NICO fighting people?

3198
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:43,740
No, it's them.

3199
02:05:43,960 --> 02:05:45,220
Fuses can like...

3200
02:05:45,220 --> 02:05:48,300
The fuse can like, chuck names from afar.

3201
02:05:49,780 --> 02:05:51,320
Like, from 800 miles.

3202
02:05:52,020 --> 02:05:52,760
Dude, that's...

3203
02:05:53,640 --> 02:05:56,460
Yeah, that's called fuse.

3204
02:05:58,340 --> 02:06:00,040
I'm not that old, man!

3205
02:06:00,360 --> 02:06:01,800
You don't have to tell me!

3206
02:06:01,820 --> 02:06:02,520
You just talked to me like I'm...

3207
02:06:02,520 --> 02:06:03,480
I can't do something!

3208
02:06:08,660 --> 02:06:09,360
They're running?

3209
02:06:09,860 --> 02:06:11,560
Oh shit, NICO's going in!

3210
02:06:14,360 --> 02:06:15,400
He's going in!

3211
02:06:16,880 --> 02:06:18,620
I just realized you're still white armor.

3212
02:06:20,180 --> 02:06:20,660
Yeah.

3213
02:06:20,800 --> 02:06:21,460
Go help him!

3214
02:06:22,720 --> 02:06:23,720
Wait, where are they?

3215
02:06:24,160 --> 02:06:25,440
Oh, they're still over there.

3216
02:06:25,700 --> 02:06:26,780
Are they still running?

3217
02:06:27,700 --> 02:06:28,660
Fucking cowards!

3218
02:06:29,500 --> 02:06:29,980
I ran up there.

3219
02:06:29,980 --> 02:06:31,740
I'm gonna run up there.

3220
02:06:31,740 --> 02:06:33,280
Hey, they're fighting someone else!

3221
02:06:33,660 --> 02:06:35,260
Oh, they're going, they're going, they're going up!

3222
02:06:36,780 --> 02:06:37,380
Wait, what?

3223
02:06:39,180 --> 02:06:41,240
I hear like, so many gunshots.

3224
02:06:42,600 --> 02:06:43,460
Like, here?

3225
02:06:44,280 --> 02:06:44,720
Yeah.

3226
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:46,240
And also here?

3227
02:06:47,120 --> 02:06:47,880
On that building.

3228
02:06:50,320 --> 02:06:51,220
The cracked one?

3229
02:06:51,420 --> 02:06:52,100
There's healing.

3230
02:06:53,380 --> 02:06:54,580
Aw, I couldn't get him.

3231
02:06:55,340 --> 02:06:57,560
We're like, in between a lot of teams.

3232
02:06:57,760 --> 02:06:58,240
I don't know.

3233
02:06:58,240 --> 02:06:59,100
I don't like this.

3234
02:06:59,240 --> 02:06:59,940
Yeah, I don't either.

3235
02:07:00,720 --> 02:07:04,340
Okay, let's head over there and see if we can get it there on time.

3236
02:07:05,720 --> 02:07:06,720
They're fighting at it.

3237
02:07:09,700 --> 02:07:10,280
Don't worry.

3238
02:07:11,760 --> 02:07:12,740
We're coming in!

3239
02:07:12,880 --> 02:07:13,720
Third party!

3240
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:14,640
Wait, it's gone.

3241
02:07:15,180 --> 02:07:16,020
Wait, what the fuck?

3242
02:07:17,220 --> 02:07:17,740
Cracked one?

3243
02:07:18,300 --> 02:07:19,260
Wait, can we still get there?

3244
02:07:19,900 --> 02:07:20,740
What the fuck?

3245
02:07:20,980 --> 02:07:22,580
Are they gonna come towards...

3246
02:07:22,580 --> 02:07:22,920
No!

3247
02:07:23,140 --> 02:07:23,800
It's gone!

3248
02:07:25,400 --> 02:07:26,940
But I think we have to run.

3249
02:07:28,240 --> 02:07:28,720
Wait, in front of me?

3250
02:07:29,680 --> 02:07:30,120
Whoa!

3251
02:07:32,460 --> 02:07:33,240
I don't...

3252
02:07:34,620 --> 02:07:36,000
I don't like this.

3253
02:07:37,260 --> 02:07:38,720
I smoked again for you.

3254
02:07:39,540 --> 02:07:40,180
Thank you.

3255
02:07:41,920 --> 02:07:44,520
I think we maybe...

3256
02:07:45,180 --> 02:07:46,020
Oh, wait.

3257
02:07:46,080 --> 02:07:46,560
You got him?

3258
02:07:47,060 --> 02:07:47,980
I'm gonna drop down.

3259
02:07:48,140 --> 02:07:50,780
I'm gonna drop down from here.

3260
02:07:50,940 --> 02:07:51,800
Another squad on him.

3261
02:07:52,680 --> 02:07:53,440
That's not good.

3262
02:07:54,760 --> 02:07:57,260
I am sliding into the other squad now.

3263
02:08:04,340 --> 02:08:04,860
Squadding...

3264
02:08:04,860 --> 02:08:06,060
Oh, nice.

3265
02:08:07,340 --> 02:08:08,120
Got one.

3266
02:08:13,050 --> 02:08:14,630
Wait, he has fucking digi too.

3267
02:08:14,730 --> 02:08:15,050
That's illegal.

3268
02:08:17,910 --> 02:08:18,850
Oh my god.

3269
02:08:21,090 --> 02:08:22,850
I don't know where...

3270
02:08:22,850 --> 02:08:23,670
Oh, he's over here.

3271
02:08:24,530 --> 02:08:25,050
95?

3272
02:08:25,310 --> 02:08:25,610
Flesh?

3273
02:08:29,460 --> 02:08:30,900
Does any of them have R9?

3274
02:08:31,520 --> 02:08:32,040
Nope.

3275
02:08:32,220 --> 02:08:33,240
I'm gonna loot.

3276
02:08:34,800 --> 02:08:35,840
I'm gonna...

3277
02:08:35,840 --> 02:08:37,060
You'll be fine, right?

3278
02:08:40,880 --> 02:08:42,820
You guys will be fine.

3279
02:08:43,540 --> 02:08:44,020
You guys will be fine.

3280
02:08:45,720 --> 02:08:47,620
He has to go to zone anyway, right?

3281
02:08:48,960 --> 02:08:49,480
Yep.

3282
02:08:49,600 --> 02:08:50,120
Hey.

3283
02:08:50,840 --> 02:08:51,840
What zone is this?

3284
02:08:51,980 --> 02:08:52,700
Oh, it's zone 2.

3285
02:08:52,960 --> 02:08:54,060
It doesn't matter for him.

3286
02:08:56,400 --> 02:08:58,640
Do you have a better light ammo gun?

3287
02:08:59,580 --> 02:09:00,100
Hello?

3288
02:09:02,560 --> 02:09:04,660
You're not gonna be in zone forever, right?

3289
02:09:05,500 --> 02:09:06,220
Come out.

3290
02:09:07,720 --> 02:09:08,660
You're really gonna heal in zone?

3291
02:09:11,140 --> 02:09:11,580
Wow.

3292
02:09:12,220 --> 02:09:13,520
I'm gonna scan real quick.

3293
02:09:13,780 --> 02:09:15,920
Yeah, you scan him and see if we can find him.

3294
02:09:21,340 --> 02:09:23,160
I don't see him at all right now.

3295
02:09:24,160 --> 02:09:24,600
Oh.

3296
02:09:25,200 --> 02:09:26,780
Oh, he's all the way over there.

3297
02:09:30,240 --> 02:09:31,580
Well, I'm heading over them.

3298
02:09:32,800 --> 02:09:33,240
Hello?

3299
02:09:34,240 --> 02:09:35,000
Knock knock.

3300
02:09:37,120 --> 02:09:38,000
Where are you?

3301
02:09:39,220 --> 02:09:39,820
Okay.

3302
02:09:49,100 --> 02:09:49,700
Alright.

3303
02:09:51,800 --> 02:09:54,040
He got stuck on the car.

3304
02:09:54,340 --> 02:09:55,200
Right here.

3305
02:09:58,020 --> 02:09:58,620
Okay.

3306
02:10:02,320 --> 02:10:05,540
That was a little embarrassing for that man.

3307
02:10:07,360 --> 02:10:09,340
Did I last hiding chart right?

3308
02:10:09,600 --> 02:10:10,200
Alright.

3309
02:10:10,280 --> 02:10:10,840
No problem.

3310
02:10:11,020 --> 02:10:12,280
I'm just healing up right now.

3311
02:10:13,720 --> 02:10:15,840
I don't think that guy had his driver's license.

3312
02:10:18,540 --> 02:10:19,160
Bless you.

3313
02:10:19,680 --> 02:10:19,880
Bless you.

3314
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:22,200
I hear people fighting like...

3315
02:10:22,980 --> 02:10:23,980
Umm... here.

3316
02:10:24,840 --> 02:10:26,940
Yeah, there's like another fight over there.

3317
02:10:27,060 --> 02:10:28,040
Alright, you go help Nico.

3318
02:10:28,320 --> 02:10:30,120
I'm gonna slowly walk over.

3319
02:10:30,280 --> 02:10:30,660
Run over.

3320
02:10:33,580 --> 02:10:34,580
Poor guy.

3321
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:36,660
Never got his driver's license.

3322
02:10:37,240 --> 02:10:37,440
Never got his driver's license.

3323
02:10:41,700 --> 02:10:42,600
I'm heading over.

3324
02:10:43,940 --> 02:10:45,240
There's another... There's another... There's another...

3325
02:10:45,280 --> 02:10:46,300
Oh, that's a replicator.

3326
02:10:46,600 --> 02:10:47,040
Nice.

3327
02:10:49,200 --> 02:10:50,140
I'm almost there.

3328
02:10:50,600 --> 02:10:51,220
You're knocked.

3329
02:10:51,320 --> 02:10:51,600
You're knocked.

3330
02:10:52,760 --> 02:10:53,400
Don't worry.

3331
02:10:53,940 --> 02:10:54,520
Don't worry.

3332
02:10:54,560 --> 02:10:54,880
I'm coming.

3333
02:10:55,820 --> 02:10:56,260
Nico!

3334
02:11:00,480 --> 02:11:01,220
I need help.

3335
02:11:02,460 --> 02:11:03,280
Oh, no!

3336
02:11:04,140 --> 02:11:04,580
No!

3337
02:11:05,480 --> 02:11:06,600
There's another guy!

3338
02:11:06,960 --> 02:11:07,600
Right here.

3339
02:11:07,680 --> 02:11:08,120
There's two!

3340
02:11:08,780 --> 02:11:09,020
Go me.

3341
02:11:09,120 --> 02:11:09,300
Go me.

3342
02:11:09,300 --> 02:11:09,480
Go me.

3343
02:11:09,480 --> 02:11:09,640
Go me.

3344
02:11:09,680 --> 02:11:10,780
There's another team.

3345
02:11:10,820 --> 02:11:11,780
There's another team right here.

3346
02:11:12,040 --> 02:11:13,280
Don't let them thirst me.

3347
02:11:13,320 --> 02:11:14,060
I swear to God.

3348
02:11:16,040 --> 02:11:17,300
Don't let them thirst me.

3349
02:11:17,860 --> 02:11:18,300
Don't let them thirst me.

3350
02:11:18,300 --> 02:11:19,260
I have a wingman.

3351
02:11:19,480 --> 02:11:21,380
If they thirst me, they take the wingman.

3352
02:11:22,280 --> 02:11:23,840
I just need you guys to know that.

3353
02:11:27,320 --> 02:11:28,200
They cannot...

3354
02:11:28,200 --> 02:11:29,740
They absolutely cannot thirst me.

3355
02:11:30,600 --> 02:11:32,260
They absolutely cannot thirst me!

3356
02:11:32,900 --> 02:11:33,000
They absolutely cannot thirst me!

3357
02:11:37,050 --> 02:11:38,150
I got them pretty low.

3358
02:11:38,490 --> 02:11:38,510
Ahh!

3359
02:11:40,510 --> 02:11:40,950
Ah!

3360
02:11:41,190 --> 02:11:41,190
Ah!

3361
02:11:41,370 --> 02:11:41,370
Ah!

3362
02:11:41,510 --> 02:11:41,710
Ah!

3363
02:11:41,810 --> 02:11:42,010
Ah!

3364
02:11:42,070 --> 02:11:42,110
Ah!

3365
02:11:42,410 --> 02:11:42,850
Ah!

3366
02:11:46,810 --> 02:11:48,890
That was a little scary.

3367
02:11:50,850 --> 02:11:51,810
Wait, go, go, go, go, go.

3368
02:11:51,810 --> 02:11:52,350
I'm safe.

3369
02:11:52,390 --> 02:11:53,090
I'm so safe.

3370
02:11:53,850 --> 02:11:55,090
There's no way.

3371
02:11:55,270 --> 02:11:55,310
Really?

3372
02:11:55,310 --> 02:11:55,650
You mean it?

3373
02:11:55,770 --> 02:11:57,290
Yeah, there's no way.

3374
02:11:58,790 --> 02:11:59,390
Provide me.

3375
02:11:59,430 --> 02:12:00,250
I have ray guns.

3376
02:12:01,990 --> 02:12:02,430
Alright.

3377
02:12:03,190 --> 02:12:04,610
Nice, and I can self-heal too.

3378
02:12:05,910 --> 02:12:06,350
See?

3379
02:12:08,510 --> 02:12:08,950
Easy.

3380
02:12:10,110 --> 02:12:11,830
And I'm healing on my...

3381
02:12:12,630 --> 02:12:14,110
I'm healing in my smoke too.

3382
02:12:19,060 --> 02:12:19,420
Alright.

3383
02:12:22,400 --> 02:12:25,000
Are you fucking... Oh my god.

3384
02:12:27,340 --> 02:12:28,200
Alright, I'm fine.

3385
02:12:28,440 --> 02:12:29,060
I'm okay.

3386
02:12:29,120 --> 02:12:30,820
Nobody has a med kid, but I'm okay.

3387
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:34,460
Wait, are they fighting people behind them too?

3388
02:12:34,600 --> 02:12:35,380
Or are they just shooting at me?

3389
02:12:35,540 --> 02:12:37,020
I think they're shooting at you.

3390
02:12:38,020 --> 02:12:39,200
Yeah, I was gonna say.

3391
02:12:39,720 --> 02:12:42,500
Oh, behind me, behind me, behind me!

3392
02:12:42,980 --> 02:12:43,940
I think we gotta back up.

3393
02:12:45,140 --> 02:12:46,500
I'm gonna back up fully.

3394
02:12:50,370 --> 02:12:52,090
There's too many people on us.

3395
02:12:54,490 --> 02:12:55,190
I'm good?

3396
02:12:56,730 --> 02:12:57,250
Wait.

3397
02:12:57,370 --> 02:12:58,310
I think there's more.

3398
02:12:59,190 --> 02:13:00,610
Wait, that's not good.

3399
02:13:01,470 --> 02:13:01,990
Where?

3400
02:13:06,440 --> 02:13:06,960
Where?

3401
02:13:08,800 --> 02:13:10,360
Maybe he missed me?

3402
02:13:11,280 --> 02:13:11,980
I don't know.

3403
02:13:12,060 --> 02:13:12,560
I lied.

3404
02:13:13,760 --> 02:13:15,540
You said he hit me 100%.

3405
02:13:15,540 --> 02:13:15,740
Okay.

3406
02:13:15,900 --> 02:13:17,260
Well, it has to be rat, right?

3407
02:13:17,640 --> 02:13:19,620
But men lie all the time, so...

3408
02:13:21,840 --> 02:13:23,140
Who hurt you?

3409
02:13:23,560 --> 02:13:25,240
Who hurt you?

3410
02:13:25,520 --> 02:13:25,660
Who hurt you?

3411
02:13:25,780 --> 02:13:27,420
Oh my god.

3412
02:13:27,580 --> 02:13:28,900
What a statement.

3413
02:13:33,040 --> 02:13:34,160
Oh my god.

3414
02:13:39,500 --> 02:13:40,860
They landed up there.

3415
02:13:42,100 --> 02:13:42,920
I see them.

3416
02:13:42,980 --> 02:13:43,760
They're right in front of me.

3417
02:13:45,340 --> 02:13:45,840
I'm looking.

3418
02:13:45,960 --> 02:13:47,280
I'm trying to make sure we don't...

3419
02:13:48,160 --> 02:13:50,080
I'm trying to make sure we don't get like...

3420
02:13:50,780 --> 02:13:51,140
Uh...

3421
02:13:52,120 --> 02:13:52,720
Stealth die.

3422
02:13:55,040 --> 02:13:56,300
They're just looking behind us.

3423
02:13:56,440 --> 02:13:57,480
See if there's any rats.

3424
02:14:00,400 --> 02:14:01,060
Oh, yeah.

3425
02:14:01,160 --> 02:14:01,860
I see a rat.

3426
02:14:02,860 --> 02:14:04,260
He's gonna come all the way over to us?

3427
02:14:08,390 --> 02:14:10,630
I guess he's gonna take the zip on the other side.

3428
02:14:11,110 --> 02:14:11,990
I smell it.

3429
02:14:13,710 --> 02:14:14,190
Is he?

3430
02:14:15,050 --> 02:14:15,930
Oh, there he is.

3431
02:14:16,090 --> 02:14:17,130
Wait, it's two!

3432
02:14:19,090 --> 02:14:19,730
Well, I missed.

3433
02:14:19,930 --> 02:14:20,910
Over here.

3434
02:14:21,030 --> 02:14:21,930
He ran into the house.

3435
02:14:22,030 --> 02:14:25,450
The other one has to run up normal stairs like a human being.

3436
02:14:27,370 --> 02:14:28,170
Oh, shit.

3437
02:14:28,270 --> 02:14:28,630
Okay.

3438
02:14:29,890 --> 02:14:31,370
Last guy is like below us.

3439
02:14:33,530 --> 02:14:34,690
He's running all the way across.

3440
02:14:35,530 --> 02:14:36,650
He's like running this way.

3441
02:14:42,240 --> 02:14:43,020
This is like...

3442
02:14:43,020 --> 02:14:45,600
There's like one rat in former squads.

3443
02:14:49,320 --> 02:14:50,920
I don't really have an angle on this.

3444
02:14:53,060 --> 02:14:53,840
Oh, they're shooting.

3445
02:14:53,980 --> 02:14:54,940
They're trying to kill the rat.

3446
02:14:55,020 --> 02:14:55,640
They killed the rat.

3447
02:14:59,020 --> 02:15:00,200
Rat is dead.

3448
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:02,620
Red armor?

3449
02:15:05,060 --> 02:15:05,860
Jesus Christ!

3450
02:15:06,720 --> 02:15:07,540
Speak again, idiot.

3451
02:15:09,180 --> 02:15:10,380
That's a lot of people.

3452
02:15:12,640 --> 02:15:14,200
Where do you guys have medkits?

3453
02:15:15,380 --> 02:15:16,300
I have one.

3454
02:15:16,840 --> 02:15:18,280
And I have a couple syringes.

3455
02:15:18,380 --> 02:15:18,940
Yeah, I need some.

3456
02:15:19,220 --> 02:15:19,740
I'm on my way.

3457
02:15:22,660 --> 02:15:23,060
Nice.

3458
02:15:23,160 --> 02:15:23,520
Here you go.

3459
02:15:28,960 --> 02:15:29,760
Alright, so...

3460
02:15:29,760 --> 02:15:30,360
Wait, where is zone?

3461
02:15:32,060 --> 02:15:33,600
No, they're like right below us.

3462
02:15:33,640 --> 02:15:34,560
They're like right below.

3463
02:15:38,920 --> 02:15:39,740
There's a whole squad.

3464
02:15:40,180 --> 02:15:41,440
A whole squad below us.

3465
02:15:42,040 --> 02:15:42,440
Boop!

3466
02:15:44,660 --> 02:15:45,740
Oh my god, please!

3467
02:15:45,900 --> 02:15:47,220
I don't have figments!

3468
02:15:47,820 --> 02:15:48,220
Chill!

3469
02:15:49,020 --> 02:15:50,340
I can drop you a bat right here.

3470
02:15:50,520 --> 02:15:52,140
Alright, I'll take that after my shield sells.

3471
02:15:59,480 --> 02:16:00,000
Or five.

3472
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:01,440
I think it doesn't need to be a Nika.

3473
02:16:01,640 --> 02:16:03,940
Yeah, I can just keep this cross.

3474
02:16:04,020 --> 02:16:06,000
You go with Nika and I'm just gonna keep this cross.

3475
02:16:07,160 --> 02:16:07,880
They're right here.

3476
02:16:09,460 --> 02:16:10,920
I wonder if I can nade this.

3477
02:16:11,280 --> 02:16:12,720
Or not nade, but ult this.

3478
02:16:13,780 --> 02:16:14,180
This.

3479
02:16:15,700 --> 02:16:16,960
That should hit them, right?

3480
02:16:17,320 --> 02:16:17,680
That should hit them, right?

3481
02:16:20,800 --> 02:16:22,260
Gotta make sure they don't climb up.

3482
02:16:22,360 --> 02:16:22,460
Gotta make sure they don't climb up.

3483
02:16:23,200 --> 02:16:24,440
Oh, hey, I hit one.

3484
02:16:25,440 --> 02:16:26,580
There's a team right here, stuck.

3485
02:16:27,540 --> 02:16:28,380
I knocked one.

3486
02:16:29,720 --> 02:16:30,340
Knocked on!

3487
02:16:30,800 --> 02:16:31,680
The guy behind this thing.

3488
02:16:32,400 --> 02:16:33,140
Come on!

3489
02:16:34,600 --> 02:16:36,220
He has to come over.

3490
02:16:37,480 --> 02:16:37,960
Nice.

3491
02:16:38,140 --> 02:16:38,300
We're dead.

3492
02:16:41,080 --> 02:16:42,840
Are you still in there?

3493
02:16:43,660 --> 02:16:44,360
Oh, he is.

3494
02:16:47,500 --> 02:16:49,300
I'm on my way, baby girl!

3495
02:16:50,160 --> 02:16:50,640
Woah!

3496
02:16:51,860 --> 02:16:53,960
Wait, there's a full team over here too!

3497
02:16:54,380 --> 02:16:55,900
Oh my god, it's like a pack of rats!

3498
02:16:56,580 --> 02:16:57,360
Oh my god.

3499
02:16:57,600 --> 02:16:58,200
I knocked one right here.

3500
02:16:58,860 --> 02:16:59,220
Nice.

3501
02:17:00,120 --> 02:17:02,000
I'm trying to make sure they don't climb up on us.

3502
02:17:03,400 --> 02:17:04,400
Go, Niko, go!

3503
02:17:06,820 --> 02:17:07,180
Cool.

3504
02:17:09,260 --> 02:17:10,060
Wait, are you guys okay?

3505
02:17:10,440 --> 02:17:11,140
On us, on us.

3506
02:17:11,660 --> 02:17:12,560
I'm coming over.

3507
02:17:13,560 --> 02:17:15,300
Oh shit, other team is coming over!

3508
02:17:15,920 --> 02:17:17,380
Do you have armor swaps here?

3509
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:18,520
There, there.

3510
02:17:19,820 --> 02:17:20,380
Nice, okay.

3511
02:17:23,760 --> 02:17:24,640
Nice, that's the core.

3512
02:17:24,720 --> 02:17:25,100
I need it.

3513
02:17:29,400 --> 02:17:30,680
Don't worry, I have digi.

3514
02:17:30,700 --> 02:17:32,040
Wait, there's still one more.

3515
02:17:32,740 --> 02:17:34,020
Where the fuck is the last one?

3516
02:17:36,600 --> 02:17:37,760
Oh my god, I have purple.

3517
02:17:39,080 --> 02:17:39,960
I have nades.

3518
02:17:42,220 --> 02:17:43,700
Oh, I thought that was gonna be closer.

3519
02:17:51,010 --> 02:17:52,310
I'm going up high ground.

3520
02:17:53,730 --> 02:17:55,510
I might be dead doing this.

3521
02:17:56,010 --> 02:17:56,550
On me?

3522
02:17:58,570 --> 02:18:00,350
Holy shit, what is your strength!

3523
02:18:01,590 --> 02:18:02,210
Holy shit, what is your strength!

3524
02:18:02,930 --> 02:18:04,210
Oh, he's one, he's one!

3525
02:18:04,290 --> 02:18:04,410
Oh, he's one, he's one!

3526
02:18:04,410 --> 02:18:04,670
Right here.

3527
02:18:05,310 --> 02:18:06,070
This guy is one!

3528
02:18:06,190 --> 02:18:07,170
Go Niko, go Niko!

3529
02:18:07,530 --> 02:18:07,930
Nice.

3530
02:18:09,890 --> 02:18:10,590
Niko's got this.

3531
02:18:10,630 --> 02:18:11,230
He can 1v3.

3532
02:18:12,170 --> 02:18:13,210
Believe in Niko!

3533
02:18:14,490 --> 02:18:15,190
Glut your carry!

3534
02:18:17,310 --> 02:18:18,030
Glut your carry!

3535
02:18:20,250 --> 02:18:20,850
Yeah!

3536
02:18:22,690 --> 02:18:24,210
We did it everyone!

3537
02:18:24,790 --> 02:18:25,090
Yeah!

3538
02:18:26,590 --> 02:18:27,190
Yay!

3539
02:18:28,590 --> 02:18:30,090
Let him go!

3540
02:18:30,550 --> 02:18:31,870
I knew he got this.

3541
02:18:32,750 --> 02:18:33,930
I knew it.

3542
02:18:33,950 --> 02:18:35,570
I knew Nico's got this.

3543
02:18:35,590 --> 02:18:37,230
This is a Nico cam.

3544
02:18:38,610 --> 02:18:39,850
What the fuck?

3545
02:18:40,990 --> 02:18:43,530
After all the meds and res I gave you?

3546
02:18:44,690 --> 02:18:46,510
Yeah, but like...

3547
02:18:46,510 --> 02:18:48,370
But did you kill the last person?

3548
02:18:48,950 --> 02:18:50,250
I did actually.

3549
02:18:50,810 --> 02:18:52,170
Wait, did you?

3550
02:18:52,530 --> 02:18:53,090
I did.

3551
02:18:53,090 --> 02:18:54,730
I did like 20 damage to him.

3552
02:18:54,790 --> 02:18:55,130
Why are you like FUNS?

3553
02:18:56,090 --> 02:18:56,570
Nice.

3554
02:18:56,610 --> 02:18:58,190
I did 20 damage to him and I killed him.

3555
02:18:58,270 --> 02:19:00,970
Holy shit we got 667 for that.

3556
02:19:01,270 --> 02:19:03,250
Why do you keep swapping the genios?

3557
02:19:03,250 --> 02:19:03,330
It's a bug.

3558
02:19:04,490 --> 02:19:10,970
It's a fucking apex bug that's been in there for like fucking years now.

3559
02:19:13,510 --> 02:19:13,990
Alright.

3560
02:19:14,970 --> 02:19:15,770
Look at that.

3561
02:19:16,010 --> 02:19:16,490
Look at that.

3562
02:19:16,510 --> 02:19:17,010
Look at us go.

3563
02:19:19,090 --> 02:19:20,350
I knew we could do it.

3564
02:19:20,650 --> 02:19:22,750
I knew Nico could do it.

3565
02:19:27,240 --> 02:19:29,140
When do we get to play Valorant, Doki?

3566
02:19:30,160 --> 02:19:30,740
Sorry, what?

3567
02:19:32,320 --> 02:19:33,000
So tomorrow?

3568
02:19:33,520 --> 02:19:33,840
Sorry.

3569
02:19:34,140 --> 02:19:34,840
What did you say?

3570
02:19:34,940 --> 02:19:36,180
Sorry, I have therapy tomorrow.

3571
02:19:36,360 --> 02:19:37,880
I have therapy tomorrow.

3572
02:19:38,560 --> 02:19:41,020
I know you do, but I know what time you have it at.

3573
02:19:41,100 --> 02:19:42,260
I know what time you have it at.

3574
02:19:42,280 --> 02:19:43,540
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

3575
02:19:43,560 --> 02:19:45,040
I was in close with you.

3576
02:19:45,160 --> 02:19:45,940
I literally heard.

3577
02:19:46,100 --> 02:19:46,680
I literally...

3578
02:19:56,900 --> 02:19:58,520
I don't know what you're talking about.

3579
02:19:58,840 --> 02:20:00,120
I don't know what you're...

3580
02:20:01,680 --> 02:20:03,520
Sorry, when did that happen?

3581
02:20:09,540 --> 02:20:11,260
So, 9pm Valorant?

3582
02:20:11,840 --> 02:20:14,060
Okay, but it's also my dog's birthday.

3583
02:20:14,860 --> 02:20:17,260
Okay, how about tonight after your nappy lappy?

3584
02:20:17,960 --> 02:20:18,520
Uh...

3585
02:20:19,880 --> 02:20:20,440
Hey!

3586
02:20:21,100 --> 02:20:21,300
Huh?

3587
02:20:21,400 --> 02:20:21,640
Hey!

3588
02:20:22,080 --> 02:20:22,500
Hey!

3589
02:20:27,660 --> 02:20:29,240
All right, LG for me.

3590
02:20:30,420 --> 02:20:30,980
LG.

3591
02:20:32,480 --> 02:20:33,520
Where are you going?

3592
02:20:33,640 --> 02:20:34,480
LG for me.

3593
02:20:34,580 --> 02:20:35,560
I'm going to sleep.

3594
02:20:35,800 --> 02:20:36,880
What do you mean?

3595
02:20:39,240 --> 02:20:40,260
Without me?

3596
02:20:40,700 --> 02:20:41,820
Oh, my god!

3597
02:20:41,880 --> 02:20:42,980
Look what you did.

3598
02:20:43,060 --> 02:20:43,980
My game crashed.

3599
02:20:44,020 --> 02:20:44,860
My game crashed.

3600
02:20:47,440 --> 02:20:49,080
That was a sign.

3601
02:20:49,320 --> 02:20:50,840
That was a sign.

3602
02:20:52,720 --> 02:20:53,480
Without me.

3603
02:20:54,140 --> 02:20:54,700
You're dead.

3604
02:20:54,700 --> 02:20:55,560
Look what you did.

3605
02:20:55,920 --> 02:20:57,600
My game fucking crashed.

3606
02:20:59,400 --> 02:21:00,520
Do you know what's the worst part?

3607
02:21:00,600 --> 02:21:01,340
You're the jump master.

3608
02:21:01,520 --> 02:21:02,960
Oh, wait, that's pretty bad!

3609
02:21:03,860 --> 02:21:06,980
Wait, usually it gives the jump master to somebody else if it crashes.

3610
02:21:08,840 --> 02:21:10,340
Did you pass it to me?

3611
02:21:10,560 --> 02:21:12,420
Did you pass it to me, Glee?

3612
02:21:12,520 --> 02:21:13,560
No, I didn't.

3613
02:21:13,560 --> 02:21:14,660
Did you pass it to me?

3614
02:21:14,660 --> 02:21:16,120
I didn't, because mine automatically passes to Nico.

3615
02:21:16,520 --> 02:21:17,980
Then Nico, okay, good.

3616
02:21:18,360 --> 02:21:18,500
Nico, pass to you.

3617
02:21:18,500 --> 02:21:19,860
We blame it on Nico again.

3618
02:21:20,100 --> 02:21:21,340
There's actually enemies here.

3619
02:21:21,940 --> 02:21:22,660
Wait, what?

3620
02:21:23,620 --> 02:21:24,440
There's people here.

3621
02:21:24,560 --> 02:21:25,000
Wait, what?

3622
02:21:25,180 --> 02:21:26,360
I just... Wait, what?

3623
02:21:26,760 --> 02:21:27,440
Wait, what?

3624
02:21:27,640 --> 02:21:28,720
I literally... Okay.

3625
02:21:29,860 --> 02:21:30,800
I just got back.

3626
02:21:31,680 --> 02:21:34,480
Okay, cool, because I landed you in a semi-alright place.

3627
02:21:34,960 --> 02:21:35,800
I don't have a gun.

3628
02:21:36,240 --> 02:21:37,100
I have an aid.

3629
02:21:42,620 --> 02:21:44,080
I got all the attachments.

3630
02:21:44,900 --> 02:21:45,600
Shut up!

3631
02:21:45,600 --> 02:21:46,380
Shut up, Doki!

3632
02:21:46,440 --> 02:21:47,360
Don't talk to me right now!

3633
02:21:49,480 --> 02:21:50,160
There's no gun.

3634
02:21:50,260 --> 02:21:51,260
I have a Mozambique.

3635
02:21:52,800 --> 02:21:53,620
It's okay.

3636
02:21:53,720 --> 02:21:55,760
I kicked the bins.

3637
02:21:59,680 --> 02:22:00,520
Okay, sir.

3638
02:22:00,620 --> 02:22:01,420
Okay, you guys looted that.

3639
02:22:02,120 --> 02:22:04,580
Oh no, I'm P20 right now.

3640
02:22:06,260 --> 02:22:08,200
I'm gonna run this.

3641
02:22:09,300 --> 02:22:10,580
Please have mercy.

3642
02:22:12,480 --> 02:22:13,580
Wait, what?

3643
02:22:15,760 --> 02:22:16,440
Okay,

3644
02:22:20,460 --> 02:22:21,160
that's not LG.

3645
02:22:21,520 --> 02:22:22,200
Okay,

3646
02:22:31,600 --> 02:22:32,260
not LG.

3647
02:22:32,460 --> 02:22:33,520
Not LG.

3648
02:22:35,400 --> 02:22:37,140
Not now, LG.

3649
02:22:41,040 --> 02:22:43,540
Look, if I crash, it doesn't count.

3650
02:22:45,980 --> 02:22:48,060
I need my nap.

3651
02:22:48,480 --> 02:22:49,300
Okay, LG.

3652
02:22:49,620 --> 02:22:50,760
Are you a quitter?

3653
02:22:54,460 --> 02:22:55,860
It's literally a 40!

3654
02:22:56,720 --> 02:22:57,320
Whoa!

3655
02:22:57,780 --> 02:23:00,080
Whoa, you gonna let Nico talk shit to you like that?

3656
02:23:00,080 --> 02:23:00,680
Wow!

3657
02:23:00,920 --> 02:23:02,580
Well, shit, I'm crying now.

3658
02:23:02,660 --> 02:23:03,460
Look, it's too done.

3659
02:23:03,820 --> 02:23:05,460
I'm crying now.

3660
02:23:06,440 --> 02:23:07,040
I'm crying now.

3661
02:23:08,040 --> 02:23:08,980
My allergies.

3662
02:23:09,180 --> 02:23:10,100
Oh my god!

3663
02:23:10,380 --> 02:23:11,400
Okay, I'm fixed now.

3664
02:23:11,540 --> 02:23:11,820
Okay.

3665
02:23:13,700 --> 02:23:15,080
I can't believe it.

3666
02:23:15,420 --> 02:23:16,560
Ready up, Nico!

3667
02:23:17,860 --> 02:23:18,820
Ready up!

3668
02:23:22,640 --> 02:23:23,980
Where the fuck is he?

3669
02:23:26,060 --> 02:23:26,900
Where did he go?

3670
02:23:31,600 --> 02:23:32,880
Where the fuck did Nico go?

3671
02:23:33,520 --> 02:23:38,640
All men do is eat hot chip, charge their phone, lie, and abandon us.

3672
02:23:39,660 --> 02:23:40,620
Are you okay?

3673
02:23:40,840 --> 02:23:42,100
Are you okay?

3674
02:23:43,120 --> 02:23:43,580
No.

3675
02:23:43,720 --> 02:23:44,700
Gumi, who hurt you?

3676
02:23:45,800 --> 02:23:46,740
Who hurt you?

3677
02:23:46,740 --> 02:23:47,360
You know who hurt me.

3678
02:23:47,360 --> 02:23:48,220
Oh, true, true.

3679
02:23:48,220 --> 02:23:48,660
You literally know my past.

3680
02:23:48,680 --> 02:23:49,460
You know my past.

3681
02:23:49,740 --> 02:23:49,780
That's not true.

3682
02:23:52,160 --> 02:23:54,320
How... I should say which one.

3683
02:23:59,160 --> 02:24:00,260
Oh, you know, that one.

3684
02:24:03,180 --> 02:24:05,620
Sorry, they all sort of blurred together.

3685
02:24:06,440 --> 02:24:07,760
They're all the same.

3686
02:24:07,820 --> 02:24:08,620
They're all the same.

3687
02:24:08,620 --> 02:24:09,120
They're all the same person.

3688
02:24:11,740 --> 02:24:13,460
You know, I don't think I can do it.

3689
02:24:13,780 --> 02:24:15,500
I will use a crutch right now.

3690
02:24:20,300 --> 02:24:22,780
He's getting water fucking weak.

3691
02:24:23,180 --> 02:24:24,980
It's all about being dehydrated.

3692
02:24:25,020 --> 02:24:27,060
Okay, don't get dehydrated, guys, when you're gaming.

3693
02:24:27,420 --> 02:24:30,980
All of my dreams I spent on you.

3694
02:24:31,380 --> 02:24:37,640
So if you need to get this girl a hug or to a cat cafe, she literally has like her dog with her.

3695
02:24:38,420 --> 02:24:39,920
She... you can't save her.

3696
02:24:42,560 --> 02:24:44,400
Save me, white girl, save me.

3697
02:24:46,480 --> 02:24:48,520
Have you seen that photo on Mercy?

3698
02:24:48,900 --> 02:24:49,600
Which one?

3699
02:24:49,700 --> 02:24:49,940
On Overwatch.

3700
02:24:50,200 --> 02:24:50,940
There's so many.

3701
02:24:51,180 --> 02:24:51,920
Save me, white girl, save me.

3702
02:24:52,180 --> 02:24:55,260
Save me, white girl, save me.

3703
02:24:56,260 --> 02:24:57,140
Yeah, come on.

3704
02:24:59,420 --> 02:25:02,300
I swear to... I swear to God, if I...

3705
02:25:02,300 --> 02:25:03,680
I crashed.

3706
02:25:07,900 --> 02:25:09,120
I swear to God.

3707
02:25:09,180 --> 02:25:10,900
I swear, I think it's the Jump Master.

3708
02:25:11,200 --> 02:25:12,220
There's no way.

3709
02:25:12,300 --> 02:25:13,300
It's the Jump Master.

3710
02:25:13,300 --> 02:25:14,580
There's no fucking way.

3711
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:16,400
I refuse to believe.

3712
02:25:16,780 --> 02:25:17,100
Every time...

3713
02:25:17,100 --> 02:25:18,180
Oh my God, Niko's talking shit.

3714
02:25:18,400 --> 02:25:19,580
He's like a 40-year-old.

3715
02:25:19,740 --> 02:25:20,020
Every time...

3716
02:25:20,020 --> 02:25:22,120
Every time I have Jump Master.

3717
02:25:22,360 --> 02:25:23,940
I swear to God.

3718
02:25:29,260 --> 02:25:30,460
Guys, no.

3719
02:25:30,760 --> 02:25:32,220
Don't bully my GPU.

3720
02:25:34,080 --> 02:25:35,060
He's shy.

3721
02:25:35,200 --> 02:25:36,800
You're making his performance anxiety.

3722
02:25:39,040 --> 02:25:40,740
He's trying his best.

3723
02:25:41,460 --> 02:25:41,960
Kazoo.

3724
02:25:42,360 --> 02:25:43,080
I'm okay.

3725
02:25:43,620 --> 02:25:45,040
We have people on us.

3726
02:25:46,180 --> 02:25:47,180
Yay, Kazoo.

3727
02:25:47,320 --> 02:25:47,780
Yay.

3728
02:25:48,380 --> 02:25:49,760
Dude, what's your dog doing?

3729
02:25:50,600 --> 02:25:52,580
He's putting his head on my lap.

3730
02:25:52,660 --> 02:25:53,700
He's just looking at me.

3731
02:25:54,520 --> 02:25:56,120
I'm a multi-billionaire.

3732
02:25:56,120 --> 02:25:57,300
I've lost my job.

3733
02:26:02,860 --> 02:26:05,360
Ducky, can you pay for my first class tickets to Japan, please?

3734
02:26:05,580 --> 02:26:05,960
Wait.

3735
02:26:06,280 --> 02:26:06,780
I'm sorry.

3736
02:26:06,800 --> 02:26:08,440
I'm a multi-billionaire.

3737
02:26:09,160 --> 02:26:10,120
From what?

3738
02:26:10,140 --> 02:26:12,300
The guy that, fucking, just met me?

3739
02:26:12,340 --> 02:26:12,960
Like four years?

3740
02:26:13,100 --> 02:26:14,680
Met me again after four years?

3741
02:26:14,720 --> 02:26:15,200
Four years ago.

3742
02:26:18,560 --> 02:26:20,980
I heard you're a multi-billionaire.

3743
02:26:21,060 --> 02:26:22,600
Can you please buy me a car?

3744
02:26:23,320 --> 02:26:24,240
I don't drive.

3745
02:26:24,780 --> 02:26:26,000
You should ask Niko.

3746
02:26:27,700 --> 02:26:28,540
Nikola Tesla.

3747
02:26:29,340 --> 02:26:32,240
I bet Niko has multi-million dollars.

3748
02:26:32,840 --> 02:26:33,360
Whoa!

3749
02:26:33,700 --> 02:26:34,040
Oh!

3750
02:26:34,880 --> 02:26:35,440
Goodbye.

3751
02:26:35,720 --> 02:26:36,260
Wow.

3752
02:26:38,360 --> 02:26:39,020
I'm fine.

3753
02:26:40,040 --> 02:26:40,780
I'm okay.

3754
02:26:42,580 --> 02:26:44,200
I don't really want to go back up there.

3755
02:26:44,780 --> 02:26:46,140
Oh my god.

3756
02:26:50,680 --> 02:26:52,680
Get fucking owned, you freaking noob!

3757
02:26:52,840 --> 02:26:53,660
Yeah, bitch.

3758
02:26:56,020 --> 02:26:57,000
He'll be fine, right?

3759
02:26:57,260 --> 02:26:58,100
You're jumping me though.

3760
02:26:58,280 --> 02:27:00,060
Oh shit, he was not fine, guys.

3761
02:27:01,480 --> 02:27:02,400
Okay, you rez him?

3762
02:27:02,500 --> 02:27:02,940
I got you.

3763
02:27:07,160 --> 02:27:07,640
Flesh?

3764
02:27:08,060 --> 02:27:09,280
What are you trying to chew?

3765
02:27:10,420 --> 02:27:10,900
Like...

3766
02:27:11,980 --> 02:27:12,460
What?

3767
02:27:13,280 --> 02:27:14,240
I rez'd him.

3768
02:27:14,360 --> 02:27:14,840
Come on now.

3769
02:27:15,600 --> 02:27:16,080
Alright.

3770
02:27:16,800 --> 02:27:18,000
Let's get the ult one.

3771
02:27:20,020 --> 02:27:20,500
Easy.

3772
02:27:20,760 --> 02:27:21,140
Wait.

3773
02:27:21,400 --> 02:27:23,100
Oh, that's our... that's us, NiKo.

3774
02:27:24,720 --> 02:27:26,040
NiKo, you're pissing me off.

3775
02:27:27,660 --> 02:27:29,720
Yeah, you're pissing us off, NiKo.

3776
02:27:30,620 --> 02:27:32,060
NiKo, you're pissing me off.

3777
02:27:35,260 --> 02:27:36,400
Why did I get a bat?

3778
02:27:36,560 --> 02:27:38,280
I could've gotten Bear Sableyes.

3779
02:27:41,460 --> 02:27:42,700
I'm going back to high ground.

3780
02:27:42,820 --> 02:27:43,780
There must be stuff up top.

3781
02:27:44,320 --> 02:27:45,080
The loot.

3782
02:27:48,280 --> 02:27:50,280
NiKo haters in the lobby.

3783
02:27:54,300 --> 02:27:55,640
Heads up, that's me!

3784
02:27:56,660 --> 02:27:57,500
Holy shit!

3785
02:28:00,960 --> 02:28:02,000
Holy shit!

3786
02:28:02,400 --> 02:28:02,560
Holy shit!

3787
02:28:02,560 --> 02:28:02,960
Holy shit!

3788
02:28:04,040 --> 02:28:04,560
Holy shit!

3789
02:28:04,560 --> 02:28:06,160
He's just a little guy.

3790
02:28:06,220 --> 02:28:06,520
He's just a little guy.

3791
02:28:07,160 --> 02:28:08,620
He's just a little guy.

3792
02:28:10,180 --> 02:28:12,000
Can't believe it, Goomy.

3793
02:28:12,140 --> 02:28:13,200
How dare you.

3794
02:28:14,760 --> 02:28:15,360
Can't believe it, Goomy.

3795
02:28:15,360 --> 02:28:15,360
How dare you.

3796
02:28:15,360 --> 02:28:16,140
Found extra supplies.

3797
02:28:16,300 --> 02:28:17,660
What has he done for me?

3798
02:28:18,100 --> 02:28:18,620
What?

3799
02:28:19,760 --> 02:28:20,560
You're right.

3800
02:28:22,080 --> 02:28:23,180
You're right, guys.

3801
02:28:23,480 --> 02:28:25,120
What has NiKo done for us?

3802
02:28:25,340 --> 02:28:26,840
What has NiKo done for us?

3803
02:28:32,230 --> 02:28:33,890
NiKo did nothing wrong.

3804
02:28:34,110 --> 02:28:34,130
NiKo did nothing wrong.

3805
02:28:34,550 --> 02:28:36,630
Wait, but he did help us win last game.

3806
02:28:38,030 --> 02:28:38,630
No.

3807
02:28:38,630 --> 02:28:38,690
No.

3808
02:28:39,790 --> 02:28:43,050
Are you in denial?

3809
02:28:45,410 --> 02:28:47,050
I literally got the last kill.

3810
02:28:49,470 --> 02:28:50,970
Yeah, like five damage.

3811
02:28:52,250 --> 02:28:52,650
What?

3812
02:28:53,310 --> 02:28:54,050
Yeah, do you have proof?

3813
02:28:54,450 --> 02:28:55,310
You were downed.

3814
02:28:55,310 --> 02:28:55,910
You were downed.

3815
02:28:55,910 --> 02:28:56,510
You have proof?

3816
02:28:56,710 --> 02:28:57,150
You can't say nothing.

3817
02:28:57,770 --> 02:28:59,230
Yeah, I have Shadow Play on...

3818
02:28:59,230 --> 02:28:59,450
Yeah?

3819
02:28:59,590 --> 02:29:00,450
All right, post it.

3820
02:29:00,490 --> 02:29:01,090
Post it on Twitter.

3821
02:29:01,870 --> 02:29:03,410
Okay, just give me a second.

3822
02:29:03,550 --> 02:29:03,970
Yeah, do it.

3823
02:29:03,990 --> 02:29:04,550
Do it right now.

3824
02:29:05,750 --> 02:29:07,070
I'm literally busy.

3825
02:29:07,230 --> 02:29:07,830
I'm playing Apex.

3826
02:29:08,050 --> 02:29:09,110
Yeah, do it right now.

3827
02:29:09,230 --> 02:29:09,870
You can literally...

3828
02:29:09,870 --> 02:29:11,050
We literally have no one here.

3829
02:29:11,390 --> 02:29:13,030
I said I'm literally playing Apex.

3830
02:29:13,130 --> 02:29:13,570
Don't talk to me.

3831
02:29:13,790 --> 02:29:14,910
We literally have no one here.

3832
02:29:15,830 --> 02:29:17,490
I can't pause this game.

3833
02:29:17,570 --> 02:29:18,390
What don't you understand?

3834
02:29:19,070 --> 02:29:19,650
Yes, you can.

3835
02:29:20,070 --> 02:29:20,830
Yes, you can.

3836
02:29:20,870 --> 02:29:21,670
We just stand still.

3837
02:29:25,310 --> 02:29:26,710
Goomy in denial.

3838
02:29:33,030 --> 02:29:34,750
I'm literally playing Apex.

3839
02:29:35,770 --> 02:29:37,490
We're all literally playing Apex.

3840
02:29:37,590 --> 02:29:38,010
What do you mean?

3841
02:29:39,190 --> 02:29:40,890
I'm literally gaming right now.

3842
02:29:42,390 --> 02:29:43,690
Where are the people?

3843
02:29:43,850 --> 02:29:45,990
Where are the people that's running at us right now?

3844
02:29:47,150 --> 02:29:48,230
I could have scanned.

3845
02:29:49,690 --> 02:29:51,710
We could scan here.

3846
02:29:52,310 --> 02:29:53,270
Is there anyone here?

3847
02:29:53,510 --> 02:29:53,670
Oh, wait.

3848
02:29:53,690 --> 02:29:54,450
No, there's no map.

3849
02:29:54,650 --> 02:29:55,730
There's only map room scans.

3850
02:29:56,350 --> 02:29:56,750
No.

3851
02:29:57,170 --> 02:29:58,050
There's a scan right there.

3852
02:29:59,470 --> 02:30:00,010
You're right.

3853
02:30:00,110 --> 02:30:00,890
It's an online game.

3854
02:30:00,970 --> 02:30:01,650
We can never pause.

3855
02:30:02,870 --> 02:30:04,070
People were here though.

3856
02:30:04,590 --> 02:30:07,990
I remember when my mom used to yell at me to pause my game while I was playing.

3857
02:30:07,990 --> 02:30:08,910
MapleStory.

3858
02:30:11,430 --> 02:30:11,970
Classic.

3859
02:30:11,970 --> 02:30:13,070
Classic moms.

3860
02:30:14,110 --> 02:30:14,990
Don't you know?

3861
02:30:15,630 --> 02:30:17,530
I'm in this field party quest.

3862
02:30:19,730 --> 02:30:20,270
And...

3863
02:30:20,990 --> 02:30:22,770
Wait, there's like people to our right.

3864
02:30:26,850 --> 02:30:28,050
Clearly to our right.

3865
02:30:31,080 --> 02:30:32,420
They're like shooting at each other.

3866
02:30:32,980 --> 02:30:35,760
Why did I see someone in your chat asking if my mom was single?

3867
02:30:38,480 --> 02:30:39,020
Ami?

3868
02:30:43,550 --> 02:30:44,090
Cracked?

3869
02:30:44,110 --> 02:30:44,950
32 flesh?

3870
02:30:45,110 --> 02:30:45,610
Right here?

3871
02:30:47,930 --> 02:30:48,630
Oh my gosh.

3872
02:30:48,790 --> 02:30:49,290
Champion's dead.

3873
02:30:50,050 --> 02:30:50,550
He's scared.

3874
02:30:50,690 --> 02:30:51,010
He's scared.

3875
02:30:51,070 --> 02:30:51,410
Jump over.

3876
02:30:52,150 --> 02:30:52,690
Trust me.

3877
02:30:54,190 --> 02:30:54,810
Jump over here.

3878
02:30:54,850 --> 02:30:55,270
Trust me.

3879
02:30:55,350 --> 02:30:55,690
There's someone right up here!

3880
02:30:56,150 --> 02:30:56,930
Oh, shit.

3881
02:30:57,170 --> 02:30:57,950
Oh, fuck.

3882
02:30:58,030 --> 02:30:58,350
Okay.

3883
02:30:58,410 --> 02:30:59,150
That was my bad.

3884
02:30:59,190 --> 02:31:00,370
I should not have told you to jump over.

3885
02:31:04,060 --> 02:31:04,780
That was...

3886
02:31:05,400 --> 02:31:05,760
Wait!

3887
02:31:06,040 --> 02:31:06,640
That's another team!

3888
02:31:09,120 --> 02:31:09,840
That's another team.

3889
02:31:09,860 --> 02:31:10,340
That's another team.

3890
02:31:10,500 --> 02:31:10,860
Woo!

3891
02:31:16,210 --> 02:31:16,830
Oh, Nico.

3892
02:31:16,950 --> 02:31:17,350
No, don't.

3893
02:31:17,350 --> 02:31:17,810
Nico, don't die.

3894
02:31:21,690 --> 02:31:22,530
Oh, fuck.

3895
02:31:22,630 --> 02:31:22,910
Okay.

3896
02:31:23,970 --> 02:31:24,450
Alright.

3897
02:31:25,030 --> 02:31:26,070
This is awkward.

3898
02:31:33,750 --> 02:31:36,270
Oh, this is awkward.

3899
02:31:37,650 --> 02:31:38,130
Wait!

3900
02:31:38,370 --> 02:31:38,590
He...

3901
02:31:39,690 --> 02:31:40,530
Oh my god!

3902
02:31:40,550 --> 02:31:41,030
I have to reload!

3903
02:31:41,190 --> 02:31:41,590
Fuck!

3904
02:31:42,150 --> 02:31:43,150
I didn't even realize.

3905
02:31:44,250 --> 02:31:44,730
Woohoohoo!

3906
02:31:47,510 --> 02:31:49,090
Wait, that's part of his team?

3907
02:31:49,190 --> 02:31:50,070
I thought it was a third!

3908
02:31:50,350 --> 02:31:51,070
Third party!

3909
02:31:51,070 --> 02:31:51,270
Third party!

3910
02:31:56,420 --> 02:31:57,960
This is a little awkward, guys.

3911
02:32:01,640 --> 02:32:02,300
You know what?

3912
02:32:02,400 --> 02:32:03,260
I can leave, right?

3913
02:32:18,780 --> 02:32:19,380
Oh, fuck!

3914
02:32:19,580 --> 02:32:19,980
No!

3915
02:32:20,140 --> 02:32:22,040
His teammate came behind me!

3916
02:32:23,000 --> 02:32:23,400
No!

3917
02:32:23,500 --> 02:32:24,780
That was a terrible ulti.

3918
02:32:25,920 --> 02:32:27,160
That was a terri... You know what?

3919
02:32:27,240 --> 02:32:27,840
We'll do another one.

3920
02:32:31,180 --> 02:32:31,580
JK.

3921
02:32:34,360 --> 02:32:34,760
This...

3922
02:32:34,760 --> 02:32:35,040
LOL.

3923
02:32:35,340 --> 02:32:36,360
This is LG.

3924
02:32:37,440 --> 02:32:37,740
LOL.

3925
02:32:39,840 --> 02:32:41,760
He seemed a little too excited there.

3926
02:32:42,500 --> 02:32:43,020
Whoa!

3927
02:32:43,380 --> 02:32:45,080
Calm down, Nico!

3928
02:32:46,220 --> 02:32:47,500
Timber down, man.

3929
02:32:47,880 --> 02:32:48,400
LOL.

3930
02:32:51,920 --> 02:32:53,880
What is he doing taking conduit?

3931
02:32:55,400 --> 02:32:56,660
What is he doing?

3932
02:32:57,340 --> 02:32:59,100
I think he called your skin ugly.

3933
02:32:59,860 --> 02:33:00,600
Wait, what?

3934
02:33:00,720 --> 02:33:01,180
Better skin.

3935
02:33:01,380 --> 02:33:01,860
How dare you?

3936
02:33:02,260 --> 02:33:03,600
This is the classic pink skin.

3937
02:33:05,020 --> 02:33:06,540
Where the comms at?

3938
02:33:07,480 --> 02:33:08,180
LOL.

3939
02:33:14,200 --> 02:33:14,900
Me.

3940
02:33:15,560 --> 02:33:16,260
Maybe.

3941
02:33:16,500 --> 02:33:18,220
Don't give me jump.

3942
02:33:19,020 --> 02:33:20,220
Or I crack.

3943
02:33:25,360 --> 02:33:26,060
Yeah.

3944
02:33:26,400 --> 02:33:29,240
There is a... There is a pattern.

3945
02:33:30,480 --> 02:33:30,830
LOL.

3946
02:33:32,570 --> 02:33:34,070
We figured out a pattern.

3947
02:33:34,810 --> 02:33:36,890
I crash when I get jumpmaster.

3948
02:33:37,650 --> 02:33:38,050
LOL.

3949
02:33:43,150 --> 02:33:43,550
Alright.

3950
02:33:43,830 --> 02:33:45,470
Where the fuck is the last two players?

3951
02:33:46,090 --> 02:33:47,590
You said I'm giving you jump?

3952
02:33:48,370 --> 02:33:49,690
That's fucked up, Nico.

3953
02:33:50,150 --> 02:33:51,550
I can't believe it.

3954
02:33:52,030 --> 02:33:52,870
I'm ready to stone.

3955
02:33:52,890 --> 02:33:55,350
We're never playing with Nico ever again.

3956
02:33:55,710 --> 02:33:56,110
LOL.

3957
02:33:57,990 --> 02:33:59,130
Cause, do you know what?

3958
02:33:59,230 --> 02:34:02,450
If you ever wanna play with Doki and I, you have to be jumpmaster.

3959
02:34:02,670 --> 02:34:03,070
Exactly.

3960
02:34:03,170 --> 02:34:03,450
You know what?

3961
02:34:03,530 --> 02:34:03,770
Yeah.

3962
02:34:03,830 --> 02:34:04,530
Tell that to him.

3963
02:34:04,550 --> 02:34:04,670
Right?

3964
02:34:04,670 --> 02:34:04,910
Right now.

3965
02:34:06,910 --> 02:34:07,650
Say it.

3966
02:34:07,830 --> 02:34:07,910
Nico?

3967
02:34:08,810 --> 02:34:09,050
Come on.

3968
02:34:09,250 --> 02:34:10,110
Use your words.

3969
02:34:10,430 --> 02:34:12,570
You're not gonna play with us ever again if you're not jumpmaster.

3970
02:34:13,010 --> 02:34:13,510
LOL.

3971
02:34:13,510 --> 02:34:14,410
I used my wits.

3972
02:34:14,770 --> 02:34:15,290
LOL.

3973
02:34:16,030 --> 02:34:18,590
We only play with people who are jumpmaster.

3974
02:34:18,650 --> 02:34:19,530
Did you get that?

3975
02:34:20,450 --> 02:34:20,970
LOL.

3976
02:34:24,090 --> 02:34:25,650
Do you understand me?

3977
02:34:25,770 --> 02:34:26,130
LOL.

3978
02:34:26,190 --> 02:34:26,710
Shit.

3979
02:34:27,070 --> 02:34:27,910
You're like a...

3980
02:34:27,910 --> 02:34:28,090
Yes, ma'am.

3981
02:34:28,290 --> 02:34:28,810
LOL.

3982
02:34:29,050 --> 02:34:29,570
LOL.

3983
02:34:30,510 --> 02:34:32,510
You're like a mob boss.

3984
02:34:32,710 --> 02:34:33,170
LOL.

3985
02:34:33,170 --> 02:34:33,670
LOL.

3986
02:34:33,670 --> 02:34:34,330
LOL.

3987
02:34:36,070 --> 02:34:36,750
LOL.

3988
02:34:36,890 --> 02:34:37,850
LOL.

3989
02:34:38,750 --> 02:34:39,230
LOL.

3990
02:34:39,490 --> 02:34:40,450
LOL.

3991
02:34:40,930 --> 02:34:41,350
LOL.

3992
02:34:41,670 --> 02:34:42,630
LOL.

3993
02:34:42,630 --> 02:34:42,650
LOL.

3994
02:34:44,930 --> 02:34:45,890
LOL.

3995
02:34:50,190 --> 02:34:51,150
LOL.

3996
02:34:51,150 --> 02:34:51,290
LOL.

3997
02:34:51,390 --> 02:34:51,630
LOL.

3998
02:34:51,950 --> 02:34:52,470
LOL.

3999
02:34:55,990 --> 02:34:56,950
LOL.

4000
02:34:56,950 --> 02:34:56,990
LOL.

4001
02:34:57,150 --> 02:34:57,390
LOL.

4002
02:34:57,390 --> 02:34:57,570
LOL.

4003
02:34:57,570 --> 02:34:57,610
LOL.

4004
02:34:58,450 --> 02:34:59,410
LOL.

4005
02:34:59,850 --> 02:35:00,450
LOL.

4006
02:35:01,510 --> 02:35:02,450
There we go.

4007
02:35:03,090 --> 02:35:04,410
Yeah, that's what we thought.

4008
02:35:04,590 --> 02:35:05,350
That's what we thought.

4009
02:35:11,530 --> 02:35:13,830
Oh my god, what happened to you, Gu?

4010
02:35:13,930 --> 02:35:14,630
You changed.

4011
02:35:16,490 --> 02:35:17,810
I played League of Legends.

4012
02:35:18,130 --> 02:35:19,990
Oh, I'm sorry.

4013
02:35:20,710 --> 02:35:22,570
I play League of Legends every day.

4014
02:35:25,830 --> 02:35:26,790
And Valorant?!

4015
02:35:28,430 --> 02:35:30,630
Are you okay, like, mentally?

4016
02:35:40,710 --> 02:35:43,890
I'm surprised you do two of them at the same time.

4017
02:35:44,090 --> 02:35:44,830
In front of us!

4018
02:35:44,950 --> 02:35:45,610
Oh, Gu!

4019
02:35:46,630 --> 02:35:47,330
I got you.

4020
02:35:48,570 --> 02:35:49,810
I cracked one of them.

4021
02:35:52,410 --> 02:35:53,310
I cracked the other.

4022
02:35:55,370 --> 02:35:55,970
Cracked one?

4023
02:35:56,790 --> 02:35:57,210
Yeah, that's right.

4024
02:35:57,290 --> 02:35:57,930
Run, bitch.

4025
02:35:58,690 --> 02:35:59,090
Yeah.

4026
02:35:59,730 --> 02:36:00,130
Bitch?

4027
02:36:01,230 --> 02:36:01,990
Yeah, wait.

4028
02:36:02,150 --> 02:36:03,410
They're pulling up in the whippy!

4029
02:36:03,570 --> 02:36:04,530
Wait, I think that's the nerf.

4030
02:36:06,290 --> 02:36:06,830
Last one?

4031
02:36:07,070 --> 02:36:07,990
Wait, is that the same?

4032
02:36:08,170 --> 02:36:09,030
Okay, yeah, he is.

4033
02:36:10,210 --> 02:36:11,490
I hear someone to my right.

4034
02:36:12,930 --> 02:36:13,510
Yeah, here.

4035
02:36:17,930 --> 02:36:18,570
Oh, nice.

4036
02:36:18,650 --> 02:36:19,230
Niko got it.

4037
02:36:19,270 --> 02:36:19,570
Nice!

4038
02:36:19,590 --> 02:36:20,450
We all got it!

4039
02:36:21,530 --> 02:36:22,310
Yeah, Diane!

4040
02:36:23,330 --> 02:36:24,110
Be Betty.

4041
02:36:24,210 --> 02:36:24,830
Yeah, Diane!

4042
02:36:25,270 --> 02:36:25,510
Yeah!

4043
02:36:27,790 --> 02:36:28,190
Diane!

4044
02:36:30,770 --> 02:36:31,370
Diane!

4045
02:36:31,370 --> 02:36:31,790
Come back.

4046
02:36:37,350 --> 02:36:39,330
Someone does not like Diane.

4047
02:36:42,930 --> 02:36:44,390
We got two parts!

4048
02:36:44,450 --> 02:36:46,650
What even is in the care package anyway?

4049
02:36:50,230 --> 02:36:51,130
F screws!

4050
02:36:51,130 --> 02:36:53,750
Grabbing a vault Prowler.

4051
02:36:54,710 --> 02:36:57,150
No long range, which isn't ideal.

4052
02:36:57,950 --> 02:36:59,590
I have a hemlock, anyone trade?

4053
02:36:59,650 --> 02:37:00,650
Yeah, I'll trade it.

4054
02:37:00,730 --> 02:37:01,870
I'll trade it for Prowler.

4055
02:37:04,510 --> 02:37:05,110
Nice.

4056
02:37:15,960 --> 02:37:18,860
I'm grabbing the... What?

4057
02:37:19,020 --> 02:37:19,380
Oh!

4058
02:37:20,140 --> 02:37:22,180
Guess I'm not grabbing the fucking bat.

4059
02:37:23,940 --> 02:37:24,760
On my ping.

4060
02:37:24,920 --> 02:37:25,980
No, my battery!

4061
02:37:26,740 --> 02:37:28,260
My battery for my white armor!

4062
02:37:31,060 --> 02:37:31,780
Where is it?

4063
02:37:32,920 --> 02:37:34,240
I don't know, did I pick it up?

4064
02:37:38,190 --> 02:37:38,990
He's over there.

4065
02:37:39,230 --> 02:37:39,910
So far.

4066
02:37:41,950 --> 02:37:44,550
Oh my god, they have like a little head glitch area.

4067
02:37:44,870 --> 02:37:46,770
Wingman, Eva, Bow and Kraber.

4068
02:37:46,890 --> 02:37:49,830
Oh, they just took away the Prowler for the Eva 8.

4069
02:37:51,690 --> 02:37:52,590
I see them.

4070
02:37:52,630 --> 02:37:53,470
They're all over there.

4071
02:37:53,850 --> 02:37:55,410
I had no red just now.

4072
02:37:56,570 --> 02:37:57,830
No, he knows I have white.

4073
02:37:59,450 --> 02:37:59,850
What?

4074
02:38:00,070 --> 02:38:01,010
He knows I have white.

4075
02:38:01,110 --> 02:38:01,130
Oh!

4076
02:38:01,670 --> 02:38:02,070
Shit!

4077
02:38:03,110 --> 02:38:04,690
That like, booted me off almost.

4078
02:38:05,390 --> 02:38:06,170
I thought you were Chinese.

4079
02:38:10,900 --> 02:38:11,720
I'm not going to die.

4080
02:38:11,960 --> 02:38:12,720
I'm not going to die.

4081
02:38:13,500 --> 02:38:14,300
I'm not going to die.

4082
02:38:14,660 --> 02:38:15,240
I'm going to die.

4083
02:38:16,620 --> 02:38:17,500
I see that light.

4084
02:38:18,880 --> 02:38:22,100
Okay, I don't... I don't have shields anymore.

4085
02:38:23,300 --> 02:38:24,860
They took everything from me.

4086
02:38:27,760 --> 02:38:29,720
They took everything from me.

4087
02:38:32,300 --> 02:38:33,820
Cracked the caustic and went up there.

4088
02:38:33,880 --> 02:38:36,080
Alright, I'm going to... I'm fucked.

4089
02:38:36,700 --> 02:38:37,840
I am so fucked.

4090
02:38:42,740 --> 02:38:45,220
Oh, I'm going to bat with my white armor.

4091
02:38:49,040 --> 02:38:51,040
Is this... is this ours?

4092
02:38:51,160 --> 02:38:51,880
I can't tell.

4093
02:38:52,880 --> 02:38:54,700
Girl, do we look like we have a Bangalore?

4094
02:38:54,860 --> 02:38:55,240
Yes, we do!

4095
02:38:55,360 --> 02:38:56,000
What do you mean?

4096
02:38:57,440 --> 02:38:58,260
Oh, what the fuck?

4097
02:38:58,420 --> 02:39:00,820
Moneko changes every time I look at him!

4098
02:39:01,840 --> 02:39:04,980
Does it look like we have a Bangalore?

4099
02:39:05,400 --> 02:39:06,200
I'm fucked.

4100
02:39:06,480 --> 02:39:07,720
Okay, I'm fucked.

4101
02:39:07,740 --> 02:39:08,860
I got shot from the back.

4102
02:39:12,640 --> 02:39:16,360
Wait, are you alive?

4103
02:39:21,730 --> 02:39:24,210
I am very afraid for your life right now.

4104
02:39:25,010 --> 02:39:27,070
I do not... shit!

4105
02:39:27,350 --> 02:39:30,370
You are 100% fucked right now.

4106
02:39:31,210 --> 02:39:32,150
You know what?

4107
02:39:32,250 --> 02:39:35,050
You know what?

4108
02:39:35,090 --> 02:39:36,090
We can do one more game.

4109
02:39:43,310 --> 02:39:45,190
Oh, literally, what the fuck?

4110
02:39:45,510 --> 02:39:46,210
You know what?

4111
02:39:46,410 --> 02:39:47,770
I can do one more.

4112
02:39:48,430 --> 02:39:50,330
I can keep going.

4113
02:39:51,610 --> 02:39:53,430
The ride never ends.

4114
02:39:54,990 --> 02:39:56,650
Doki, are you getting me flowers tomorrow?

4115
02:39:57,670 --> 02:39:58,230
What?

4116
02:39:59,010 --> 02:39:59,310
What?

4117
02:39:59,310 --> 02:40:00,870
Shouldn't you be getting my dog flowers?

4118
02:40:02,730 --> 02:40:05,770
I would if you gave me your new address when I asked for it.

4119
02:40:06,010 --> 02:40:06,750
I did!

4120
02:40:06,850 --> 02:40:08,170
I sent you...

4121
02:40:08,170 --> 02:40:09,150
You literally never did!

4122
02:40:09,650 --> 02:40:10,950
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

4123
02:40:11,050 --> 02:40:12,890
I'm gonna type for it.

4124
02:40:12,950 --> 02:40:14,190
I'm gonna leave my text.

4125
02:40:14,250 --> 02:40:15,450
No, no, no, no, I did.

4126
02:40:15,570 --> 02:40:15,870
I did.

4127
02:40:15,890 --> 02:40:16,350
I remember.

4128
02:40:16,590 --> 02:40:19,070
I remember texting you my address.

4129
02:40:19,750 --> 02:40:20,990
You never did.

4130
02:40:20,990 --> 02:40:21,290
I did!

4131
02:40:21,310 --> 02:40:21,890
I did!

4132
02:40:21,990 --> 02:40:22,930
I remember.

4133
02:40:23,150 --> 02:40:23,810
I did.

4134
02:40:24,310 --> 02:40:26,150
I 100% did.

4135
02:40:26,930 --> 02:40:27,750
I remember.

4136
02:40:27,750 --> 02:40:27,870
I remember.

4137
02:40:30,290 --> 02:40:31,330
It's right there.

4138
02:40:32,350 --> 02:40:33,370
Where's right there?

4139
02:40:34,570 --> 02:40:35,990
It's literally right there.

4140
02:40:36,770 --> 02:40:38,110
Where's right there?

4141
02:40:38,250 --> 02:40:39,310
It's right there.

4142
02:40:40,250 --> 02:40:41,110
Right where?

4143
02:40:41,970 --> 02:40:44,810
It's... it's... okay, that's not my fault you're blind.

4144
02:40:45,310 --> 02:40:47,930
Okay, maybe... I think I deleted it after.

4145
02:40:53,240 --> 02:40:56,220
Look, someone... what if someone random sees it?

4146
02:40:56,400 --> 02:40:58,880
What if you have your, like, Discord or phone open?

4147
02:40:58,880 --> 02:41:00,220
And it always sees it?

4148
02:41:00,280 --> 02:41:01,260
I must have deleted it.

4149
02:41:01,260 --> 02:41:02,380
Who's gonna look at my phone?

4150
02:41:02,680 --> 02:41:03,420
I... what?

4151
02:41:03,840 --> 02:41:04,780
I don't know!

4152
02:41:05,620 --> 02:41:07,520
Someone that steals your phone?

4153
02:41:11,760 --> 02:41:15,500
And they're gonna look for wife number four, specifically?

4154
02:41:15,820 --> 02:41:17,460
And send them my text messages for wife number four?

4155
02:41:17,460 --> 02:41:20,200
Yeah, cause they're gonna be like, what the fuck is wife number four?

4156
02:41:20,920 --> 02:41:22,440
Oh, so I'm number four?

4157
02:41:24,340 --> 02:41:26,520
I've known you for seven years.

4158
02:41:28,580 --> 02:41:30,620
I've known you for 7 years!

4159
02:41:30,720 --> 02:41:32,520
I've known you for 7 years and I'm wife number 4?!

4160
02:41:33,360 --> 02:41:34,540
Let's not pay attention to that.

4161
02:41:34,700 --> 02:41:36,900
What do you mean let's not pay attention to that?!

4162
02:41:36,900 --> 02:41:39,560
I'm gonna die because I'm wife number 4!

4163
02:41:41,920 --> 02:41:43,340
This is your fault!

4164
02:41:49,960 --> 02:41:51,700
This is your fault!

4165
02:41:52,360 --> 02:41:54,620
This is your fault!

4166
02:41:55,340 --> 02:41:58,800
I got too distracted for being wife number 4.

4167
02:41:58,800 --> 02:41:59,900
I'm wife number 4.

4168
02:42:01,580 --> 02:42:02,640
Who's number 3?

4169
02:42:04,400 --> 02:42:05,440
Who's number 3?

4170
02:42:05,600 --> 02:42:07,020
Give me the name right now!

4171
02:42:08,380 --> 02:42:10,020
Her name is Rose.

4172
02:42:10,460 --> 02:42:11,700
Who the fuck is Rose?

4173
02:42:12,740 --> 02:42:13,680
My wife.

4174
02:42:14,040 --> 02:42:14,940
Who the fuck?

4175
02:42:14,960 --> 02:42:16,160
How long has she known you?

4176
02:42:17,660 --> 02:42:18,780
Since 2014.

4177
02:42:20,740 --> 02:42:21,600
We got this.

4178
02:42:21,680 --> 02:42:22,240
2013?

4179
02:42:23,600 --> 02:42:25,000
Over a decade.

4180
02:42:25,460 --> 02:42:26,480
Okay, okay, okay.

4181
02:42:27,120 --> 02:42:28,460
Wife number 2.

4182
02:42:30,680 --> 02:42:31,030
Um...

4183
02:42:31,960 --> 02:42:32,660
Christina?

4184
02:42:33,260 --> 02:42:34,880
Alright, how many years?

4185
02:42:35,440 --> 02:42:36,140
Preschool.

4186
02:42:36,520 --> 02:42:38,540
What the fuck?!

4187
02:42:38,540 --> 02:42:40,480
Alright, wife number 1.

4188
02:42:41,280 --> 02:42:41,960
Priscilla?

4189
02:42:42,520 --> 02:42:43,060
How long?

4190
02:42:44,620 --> 02:42:46,620
Before we were even born.

4191
02:42:46,820 --> 02:42:47,980
Alright, now you're...

4192
02:42:47,980 --> 02:42:54,100
Now I know for fucking sure all these wives are not Now I know you're making shit up.

4193
02:42:54,320 --> 02:42:55,200
They're real!

4194
02:42:55,420 --> 02:42:56,060
They're real!

4195
02:42:56,240 --> 02:42:58,120
They're not real.

4196
02:42:58,860 --> 02:42:59,980
There's no fucking way.

4197
02:43:01,220 --> 02:43:03,120
There's no fucking way.

4198
02:43:03,220 --> 02:43:07,640
One to three are ten plus years.

4199
02:43:08,300 --> 02:43:11,730
In a row?

4200
02:43:11,950 --> 02:43:12,770
Three in a row.

4201
02:43:12,970 --> 02:43:14,090
Three in a row.

4202
02:43:16,150 --> 02:43:16,890
I have friends.

4203
02:43:17,010 --> 02:43:18,770
I have friends.

4204
02:43:19,590 --> 02:43:20,810
Alright, wife number 1.

4205
02:43:20,870 --> 02:43:21,030
Who?

4206
02:43:21,170 --> 02:43:22,290
Who is wife number 1?

4207
02:43:22,650 --> 02:43:24,150
I literally told you Priscilla!

4208
02:43:24,810 --> 02:43:28,350
You said like you've known her since like fucking before you were born.

4209
02:43:28,530 --> 02:43:29,710
That doesn't make sense.

4210
02:43:31,470 --> 02:43:31,830
We're families!

4211
02:43:31,830 --> 02:43:33,010
We knew each other before we were born!

4212
02:43:36,170 --> 02:43:36,390
Oh!

4213
02:43:37,350 --> 02:43:38,590
So it wasn't by choice.

4214
02:43:40,570 --> 02:43:40,610
...

4215
02:43:40,610 --> 02:43:40,750
...

4216
02:43:46,900 --> 02:43:47,260
...

4217
02:43:48,460 --> 02:43:48,820
...

4218
02:43:49,780 --> 02:43:51,680
Are you saying I was in an arranged marriage?

4219
02:43:51,780 --> 02:43:52,140
...

4220
02:43:54,140 --> 02:43:56,980
Oh my god, did you know my mom almost put me in an arranged marriage when I was young?

4221
02:43:57,200 --> 02:43:58,540
Yeah, Priscilla!

4222
02:43:59,140 --> 02:43:59,500
...

4223
02:44:00,980 --> 02:44:01,340
...

4224
02:44:03,280 --> 02:44:03,640
...

4225
02:44:05,560 --> 02:44:05,920
...

4226
02:44:14,160 --> 02:44:15,920
Alright, well now I know.

4227
02:44:16,260 --> 02:44:17,100
Now I know.

4228
02:44:17,300 --> 02:44:19,540
I could never win over Priscilla.

4229
02:44:20,340 --> 02:44:23,660
Girl, you literally put me as Cali girl number 4 or something last time.

4230
02:44:23,800 --> 02:44:24,280
...

4231
02:44:24,280 --> 02:44:25,060
...

4232
02:44:27,820 --> 02:44:30,160
I did not put you as number 4!

4233
02:44:30,800 --> 02:44:31,540
I just...

4234
02:44:31,540 --> 02:44:33,440
I didn't even have a number.

4235
02:44:33,640 --> 02:44:34,600
You were the first one.

4236
02:44:35,100 --> 02:44:35,580
...

4237
02:44:36,520 --> 02:44:39,660
I'm the original Cali girl?

4238
02:44:39,660 --> 02:44:41,440
You're the original Cali girl!

4239
02:44:41,720 --> 02:44:43,600
And so, wife number 4.

4240
02:44:46,160 --> 02:44:48,500
Well, now I know...

4241
02:44:48,500 --> 02:44:48,800
...

4242
02:44:48,800 --> 02:44:51,160
who favors who in this friendship.

4243
02:44:51,740 --> 02:44:52,080
...

4244
02:44:53,240 --> 02:44:57,380
You literally held me gunpoint to bring back the puke emote.

4245
02:44:57,780 --> 02:44:58,080
...

4246
02:45:01,970 --> 02:45:03,010
What do you mean?

4247
02:45:03,050 --> 02:45:04,350
It's called a deal.

4248
02:45:04,810 --> 02:45:04,950
...

4249
02:45:04,950 --> 02:45:07,110
It's called a business deal.

4250
02:45:07,630 --> 02:45:08,310
...

4251
02:45:08,310 --> 02:45:11,190
Where'd that Ball Eldrin from the business deal go?

4252
02:45:12,250 --> 02:45:12,450
...

4253
02:45:12,450 --> 02:45:13,370
fine!

4254
02:45:15,990 --> 02:45:17,470
I'm gonna die...

4255
02:45:17,470 --> 02:45:19,390
I'm already dead!

4256
02:45:25,070 --> 02:45:26,510
I'll save you, my Princess!

4257
02:45:26,950 --> 02:45:27,750
Thank you!

4258
02:45:27,970 --> 02:45:28,770
Cali girl!

4259
02:45:31,290 --> 02:45:32,590
Go, Cali girl!

4260
02:45:32,870 --> 02:45:33,110
...

4261
02:45:33,110 --> 02:45:33,650
Go, Cali girl!

4262
02:45:33,650 --> 02:45:34,610
... ... Oh...

4263
02:45:34,610 --> 02:45:35,310
... I see you downed already.

4264
02:45:35,890 --> 02:45:38,290
... I see you...

4265
02:45:38,290 --> 02:45:38,290
Go, Cali girl!

4266
02:45:38,290 --> 02:45:39,130
Okay, we're fine.

4267
02:45:39,330 --> 02:45:40,510
Nico will be fine.

4268
02:45:40,850 --> 02:45:42,170
See, Nico got it!

4269
02:45:44,030 --> 02:45:45,010
Is that everybody?

4270
02:45:47,350 --> 02:45:47,930
Nice.

4271
02:45:50,510 --> 02:45:54,930
I missed when like... everybody in our lobby was clearly bronze.

4272
02:45:55,330 --> 02:45:55,990
Or rookie.

4273
02:45:56,730 --> 02:45:57,990
I missed that.

4274
02:45:58,610 --> 02:46:00,830
When the people get better.

4275
02:46:02,290 --> 02:46:06,010
I like how someone was like, yes I have a wife, she goes to a different school.

4276
02:46:09,350 --> 02:46:10,370
Yeah, you don't know her.

4277
02:46:10,870 --> 02:46:13,050
Yeah, you just never met her, you know?

4278
02:46:20,410 --> 02:46:22,190
Nico is like... what did Nico do?

4279
02:46:22,410 --> 02:46:23,950
Nico didn't save our lives.

4280
02:46:24,790 --> 02:46:26,410
Today, like in this game.

4281
02:46:26,810 --> 02:46:28,630
He's literally some guy.

4282
02:46:29,010 --> 02:46:29,710
Wake up.

4283
02:46:31,110 --> 02:46:33,690
Why did you say that about us?

4284
02:46:33,690 --> 02:46:34,790
We're literally some girls?

4285
02:46:35,530 --> 02:46:36,710
How are we different?

4286
02:46:36,950 --> 02:46:38,490
How are we different?

4287
02:46:39,510 --> 02:46:41,490
They're simping over some guy.

4288
02:46:42,950 --> 02:46:44,550
How are we different, Gumi?

4289
02:46:44,810 --> 02:46:45,250
Wake up.

4290
02:46:45,650 --> 02:46:46,450
Wake up.

4291
02:46:47,230 --> 02:46:47,910
Wake up.

4292
02:46:49,670 --> 02:46:52,410
Gumi, how are we different from Nico?

4293
02:46:52,850 --> 02:46:54,650
Other than the fact that he's a guy.

4294
02:46:54,910 --> 02:46:55,910
And has a dick.

4295
02:46:56,010 --> 02:46:56,870
Okay, simmer down, wife number four.

4296
02:46:57,630 --> 02:46:58,430
Oh shit!

4297
02:47:00,070 --> 02:47:00,930
Oh, I'm sorry.

4298
02:47:01,250 --> 02:47:02,950
I'm sorry I never talked back to you.

4299
02:47:03,190 --> 02:47:03,550
Simmer down.

4300
02:47:06,330 --> 02:47:07,270
I'm sorry.

4301
02:47:07,950 --> 02:47:08,430
Please.

4302
02:47:08,770 --> 02:47:09,650
I'm sorry.

4303
02:47:09,670 --> 02:47:10,290
Don't do it.

4304
02:47:11,490 --> 02:47:12,850
Don't lock me in that room again.

4305
02:47:12,990 --> 02:47:13,350
I'm sorry.

4306
02:47:15,490 --> 02:47:16,290
I'm sorry.

4307
02:47:18,230 --> 02:47:19,970
I got the white tank top on.

4308
02:47:20,370 --> 02:47:20,510
Oh no!

4309
02:47:22,730 --> 02:47:23,770
Holy fuck!

4310
02:47:26,010 --> 02:47:29,430
This is why Nico is better than us.

4311
02:47:29,450 --> 02:47:30,230
He would never.

4312
02:47:30,390 --> 02:47:35,630
He would never.

4313
02:47:37,990 --> 02:47:39,370
Never get the chance to.

4314
02:47:41,670 --> 02:47:43,790
I don't wanna hear it.

4315
02:47:45,090 --> 02:47:46,770
Nico, please save us.

4316
02:47:47,050 --> 02:47:48,170
Back in the room.

4317
02:47:48,250 --> 02:47:49,670
Back in the room, filthy bird.

4318
02:47:51,430 --> 02:47:52,870
Oh my god.

4319
02:47:52,870 --> 02:47:55,190
What happened to you, Gumi?

4320
02:47:56,690 --> 02:47:58,530
I play Rayna and Valorant.

4321
02:47:58,890 --> 02:48:00,270
Oh shit!

4322
02:48:01,350 --> 02:48:04,050
Guys, this is not Dommie Mommie.

4323
02:48:04,950 --> 02:48:08,490
Guys, if you think this is Dommie Mommie, please.

4324
02:48:09,350 --> 02:48:10,030
Please.

4325
02:48:10,190 --> 02:48:10,190
Please.

4326
02:48:10,190 --> 02:48:11,810
You need my therapist.

4327
02:48:13,130 --> 02:48:15,810
There are some issues to unpack there.

4328
02:48:15,990 --> 02:48:19,790
There is a lot of issues we need to work on.

4329
02:48:21,290 --> 02:48:22,890
I play Jett and Valorant.

4330
02:48:23,350 --> 02:48:24,450
Oh my god.

4331
02:48:24,510 --> 02:48:27,430
You're Jett daddy.

4332
02:48:32,510 --> 02:48:33,270
Call me Jetta.

4333
02:48:35,590 --> 02:48:37,830
This is why I never play Valorant.

4334
02:48:37,930 --> 02:48:38,770
I cannot do it.

4335
02:48:38,970 --> 02:48:39,550
Oh god.

4336
02:48:39,550 --> 02:48:39,930
My head hurts.

4337
02:48:39,930 --> 02:48:41,870
The E-couples and Valorant.

4338
02:48:41,930 --> 02:48:46,010
It's like Overwatch walked so Valorant could run.

4339
02:48:47,230 --> 02:48:48,330
Do you need a cam?

4340
02:48:48,530 --> 02:48:49,510
Hold on.

4341
02:48:50,230 --> 02:48:50,910
What?

4342
02:48:51,270 --> 02:48:52,110
Nothing.

4343
02:48:52,990 --> 02:48:56,330
Don't worry, wife number four.

4344
02:48:57,470 --> 02:48:58,310
What?

4345
02:48:58,450 --> 02:48:59,230
Number four?

4346
02:48:59,690 --> 02:49:01,530
Don't worry, wife number four.

4347
02:49:01,550 --> 02:49:02,970
I'll save you, my queen.

4348
02:49:03,510 --> 02:49:04,350
What?

4349
02:49:04,430 --> 02:49:05,270
What?

4350
02:49:06,950 --> 02:49:07,790
What?

4351
02:49:08,510 --> 02:49:09,350
What?

4352
02:49:10,030 --> 02:49:11,570
Get down, wife number four.

4353
02:49:13,550 --> 02:49:17,990
You're like, today I'll choose you, wife number four.

4354
02:49:20,550 --> 02:49:21,650
Oh, wife number two.

4355
02:49:21,690 --> 02:49:22,290
Go back.

4356
02:49:22,550 --> 02:49:23,970
Go back into the chamber.

4357
02:49:24,230 --> 02:49:26,490
Today is wife number four's day time.

4358
02:49:28,650 --> 02:49:29,590
No, you say.

4359
02:49:32,030 --> 02:49:33,330
Oh shit, there's people there.

4360
02:49:33,630 --> 02:49:33,890
No!

4361
02:49:35,030 --> 02:49:36,030
Guys, okay.

4362
02:49:36,910 --> 02:49:37,950
Oh, it's my discord.

4363
02:49:38,130 --> 02:49:38,610
Oh, I'm okay.

4364
02:49:38,610 --> 02:49:38,810
I'm okay.

4365
02:49:38,870 --> 02:49:39,850
I'm okay.

4366
02:49:40,250 --> 02:49:42,830
I thought my game crashed, but my discord crashed.

4367
02:49:43,170 --> 02:49:44,430
My discord crashed.

4368
02:49:45,850 --> 02:49:46,710
It's okay.

4369
02:49:46,810 --> 02:49:47,150
I'm fine.

4370
02:49:47,950 --> 02:49:49,470
I thought it was my apex.

4371
02:49:52,990 --> 02:49:53,750
Whoa, what?

4372
02:49:55,170 --> 02:49:56,030
Oh, fuck.

4373
02:49:56,270 --> 02:49:57,670
Oh, I'm getting dead slides.

4374
02:49:59,490 --> 02:50:00,930
I'm gonna cover you, rez.

4375
02:50:05,820 --> 02:50:06,620
It'll be fine.

4376
02:50:06,840 --> 02:50:07,480
There's two teams.

4377
02:50:07,560 --> 02:50:08,420
There's two teams.

4378
02:50:09,680 --> 02:50:13,060
Nico, you're dead.

4379
02:50:13,080 --> 02:50:13,880
Oh, it's just a concubine.

4380
02:50:14,340 --> 02:50:14,980
Whoa!

4381
02:50:17,450 --> 02:50:19,590
He's a side chick, if you will.

4382
02:50:19,850 --> 02:50:20,450
No!

4383
02:50:21,990 --> 02:50:23,030
My chat.

4384
02:50:23,210 --> 02:50:24,970
My chat's gonna be so angry.

4385
02:50:26,470 --> 02:50:29,230
What the fuck is...

4386
02:50:29,230 --> 02:50:29,910
Wait, where are they?

4387
02:50:30,090 --> 02:50:31,110
What the fuck?

4388
02:50:31,250 --> 02:50:32,590
My discord keeps crashing.

4389
02:50:34,430 --> 02:50:35,270
Oh, no.

4390
02:50:35,810 --> 02:50:36,730
Oh, no.

4391
02:50:37,970 --> 02:50:38,790
Are you okay?

4392
02:50:38,870 --> 02:50:40,750
No, my discord keeps crashing.

4393
02:50:41,250 --> 02:50:43,410
My toaster is overheating.

4394
02:50:43,410 --> 02:50:44,050
Oh, my god.

4395
02:50:44,050 --> 02:50:45,170
I'm sorry, Nico can get me over there.

4396
02:50:45,410 --> 02:50:45,650
Oh, my god.

4397
02:50:45,650 --> 02:50:46,010
Don't worry.

4398
02:50:50,050 --> 02:50:51,010
Save me.

4399
02:50:52,090 --> 02:50:53,110
Oh, my god.

4400
02:50:53,970 --> 02:50:54,510
I'll calm down.

4401
02:50:54,570 --> 02:50:56,390
Maybe it is a PC problem.

4402
02:50:57,610 --> 02:50:58,370
Get it.

4403
02:50:58,470 --> 02:50:58,950
Maybe...

4404
02:50:58,950 --> 02:50:59,530
You know...

4405
02:51:00,210 --> 02:51:00,450
Maybe...

4406
02:51:00,450 --> 02:51:01,070
It's okay.

4407
02:51:01,650 --> 02:51:03,890
Maybe it is a PC issue.

4408
02:51:05,950 --> 02:51:06,730
I don't know.

4409
02:51:06,850 --> 02:51:07,530
I can't tell yet.

4410
02:51:08,230 --> 02:51:09,050
I'll say it.

4411
02:51:09,110 --> 02:51:09,750
I'll say it.

4412
02:51:10,410 --> 02:51:11,050
Say what?

4413
02:51:11,050 --> 02:51:13,950
Nico is but a mashed potatoes and you're the steak to me.

4414
02:51:14,770 --> 02:51:15,890
You're the main dish.

4415
02:51:16,210 --> 02:51:17,570
Wait, then what's wife number one?

4416
02:51:21,970 --> 02:51:23,590
If... If I...

4417
02:51:24,230 --> 02:51:27,030
If I am the steak, then what's wife number one?

4418
02:51:28,750 --> 02:51:29,190
Huh?

4419
02:51:29,810 --> 02:51:31,250
You're gonna hate to hear this.

4420
02:51:31,370 --> 02:51:32,510
I think you need to cover your...

4421
02:51:32,890 --> 02:51:33,110
No.

4422
02:51:33,630 --> 02:51:34,630
I can take it.

4423
02:51:35,290 --> 02:51:36,350
I can take it.

4424
02:51:36,570 --> 02:51:39,090
I actually don't like meat that much.

4425
02:51:39,410 --> 02:51:41,030
And I don't really like steak that much.

4426
02:51:42,610 --> 02:51:43,330
Um...

4427
02:51:43,330 --> 02:51:44,250
What?

4428
02:51:45,490 --> 02:51:46,210
Um...

4429
02:51:46,210 --> 02:51:47,410
Wait...

4430
02:51:47,410 --> 02:51:47,670
I...

4431
02:51:47,670 --> 02:51:50,290
Then what's mashed potatoes to you?

4432
02:51:50,650 --> 02:51:53,110
I don't even like potatoes that much either.

4433
02:51:54,470 --> 02:51:57,030
Oh, saying so...

4434
02:51:57,030 --> 02:52:00,970
I will not go turn the lights off.

4435
02:52:03,410 --> 02:52:04,970
I can't believe it.

4436
02:52:05,350 --> 02:52:06,070
I...

4437
02:52:06,070 --> 02:52:07,570
Do I mean nothing to you?

4438
02:52:08,010 --> 02:52:08,730
I...

4439
02:52:08,730 --> 02:52:11,010
I prefer seafood and mostly chicken.

4440
02:52:11,010 --> 02:52:11,710
I prefer mostly Asian foods.

4441
02:52:11,950 --> 02:52:13,350
I'm not even seafood?

4442
02:52:14,550 --> 02:52:15,310
You can...

4443
02:52:15,900 --> 02:52:16,670
See my food?

4444
02:52:18,170 --> 02:52:19,730
I don't know what that means.

4445
02:52:22,170 --> 02:52:22,630
Okay.

4446
02:52:24,530 --> 02:52:25,370
Oh, right there!

4447
02:52:28,470 --> 02:52:29,050
Cracked him?

4448
02:52:30,330 --> 02:52:30,790
Knock?

4449
02:52:33,710 --> 02:52:34,470
I got you.

4450
02:52:34,630 --> 02:52:35,550
I'm gonna push up a little.

4451
02:52:36,210 --> 02:52:38,010
I might be doing something stupid.

4452
02:52:38,510 --> 02:52:40,410
I think someone just threw a nade at me.

4453
02:52:43,050 --> 02:52:44,010
Oh, I did...

4454
02:52:44,010 --> 02:52:45,510
I cracked him!

4455
02:52:45,610 --> 02:52:46,010
I cracked him!

4456
02:52:46,530 --> 02:52:47,930
Oh, I did something stupid!

4457
02:52:48,190 --> 02:52:49,550
I got shot in my asshole!

4458
02:52:50,030 --> 02:52:50,550
It's okay.

4459
02:52:50,630 --> 02:52:51,470
Nico can res me.

4460
02:52:52,030 --> 02:52:53,530
Oh, he's so fucking dead.

4461
02:52:53,670 --> 02:52:54,030
I...

4462
02:52:54,030 --> 02:52:56,050
I got beamed so fucking hard.

4463
02:52:56,110 --> 02:52:58,290
There is a team right there on you, Kumi.

4464
02:52:58,370 --> 02:53:01,470
So, I'm just gonna crawl to Nico cause I think he can...

4465
02:53:01,470 --> 02:53:01,810
Oh, wait!

4466
02:53:01,850 --> 02:53:02,250
You did it!

4467
02:53:02,650 --> 02:53:03,050
Kumi!

4468
02:53:03,150 --> 02:53:03,270
Kumi!

4469
02:53:03,330 --> 02:53:03,910
I'm so safe.

4470
02:53:03,930 --> 02:53:04,710
I'm so safe, Kumi.

4471
02:53:05,230 --> 02:53:06,790
I swear to God.

4472
02:53:07,770 --> 02:53:09,610
I have never been this safe before.

4473
02:53:14,600 --> 02:53:15,000
Alright.

4474
02:53:15,120 --> 02:53:15,360
I'm gonna go.

4475
02:53:15,360 --> 02:53:15,760
Nice.

4476
02:53:15,860 --> 02:53:15,980
You know what...

4477
02:53:15,980 --> 02:53:18,080
There's a kill swap here.

4478
02:53:18,260 --> 02:53:18,960
Alright, nice.

4479
02:53:19,760 --> 02:53:20,680
I'm gonna...

4480
02:53:22,860 --> 02:53:25,620
Okay, I sort of egoed somebody way too hard.

4481
02:53:25,820 --> 02:53:26,400
I thought...

4482
02:53:26,400 --> 02:53:28,080
I thought I could live that.

4483
02:53:31,820 --> 02:53:32,980
I like how...

4484
02:53:32,980 --> 02:53:36,360
I like how you didn't res me and Nico res me.

4485
02:53:36,960 --> 02:53:39,000
Girl, I was fighting for my life!

4486
02:53:39,140 --> 02:53:39,220
I like...

4487
02:53:39,220 --> 02:53:40,580
You tried to confirm your safety.

4488
02:53:40,580 --> 02:53:43,560
I bet if I was wife number one, you would res me instantly.

4489
02:53:44,140 --> 02:53:44,640
I...

4490
02:53:44,640 --> 02:53:44,840
I...

4491
02:53:49,440 --> 02:53:50,520
I don't know.

4492
02:53:50,620 --> 02:53:51,280
I have a feeling.

4493
02:53:56,650 --> 02:53:58,590
It's just a little feeling I have.

4494
02:54:05,120 --> 02:54:09,580
That was the fucking biggest nade I've ever seen.

4495
02:54:10,180 --> 02:54:11,420
They cooked that shit up!

4496
02:54:11,980 --> 02:54:13,960
I think we should head to Nico.

4497
02:54:16,080 --> 02:54:16,520
Go!

4498
02:54:16,680 --> 02:54:18,040
Okay, give me your shield.

4499
02:54:18,220 --> 02:54:18,680
Give me your shield.

4500
02:54:18,880 --> 02:54:18,900
Give me your shield.

4501
02:54:19,800 --> 02:54:20,240
Okay.

4502
02:54:20,360 --> 02:54:21,760
I'm so dead.

4503
02:54:24,100 --> 02:54:24,980
Nico, no!

4504
02:54:26,040 --> 02:54:26,560
Nico!

4505
02:54:27,540 --> 02:54:28,440
Oh, okay.

4506
02:54:28,780 --> 02:54:30,280
Why are you still in bronze?

4507
02:54:30,380 --> 02:54:32,160
We gave you five hours!

4508
02:54:34,560 --> 02:54:36,380
You know, I can do one more.

4509
02:54:36,620 --> 02:54:37,940
I can do another one.

4510
02:54:37,940 --> 02:54:39,280
Who the fuck are you talking to?

4511
02:54:40,820 --> 02:54:42,560
The guy that killed us!

4512
02:54:42,720 --> 02:54:43,980
They were in Prince Town!

4513
02:54:44,680 --> 02:54:45,200
Oh.

4514
02:54:46,440 --> 02:54:49,720
We gave you five hours to climb out of bronze.

4515
02:54:49,820 --> 02:54:50,340
Oh, okay.

4516
02:54:52,960 --> 02:54:54,460
I can't do nothing.

4517
02:54:59,240 --> 02:55:02,300
I think my PC is overheating because it's so fucking hot.

4518
02:55:02,460 --> 02:55:02,760
Wait!

4519
02:55:02,900 --> 02:55:04,120
My window's closed again!

4520
02:55:04,200 --> 02:55:04,740
Oh my god!

4521
02:55:04,760 --> 02:55:05,920
My PC's hot too!

4522
02:55:06,220 --> 02:55:06,360
Wait!

4523
02:55:06,600 --> 02:55:08,220
I think my mom closed the window.

4524
02:55:08,280 --> 02:55:09,340
Let me open it again.

4525
02:55:10,040 --> 02:55:12,020
My room's 69 degrees!

4526
02:55:16,870 --> 02:55:17,310
I...

4527
02:55:18,990 --> 02:55:19,430
I...

4528
02:55:20,610 --> 02:55:21,170
We're good.

4529
02:55:22,330 --> 02:55:24,530
Dude, my room is 20 degrees right now.

4530
02:55:24,570 --> 02:55:24,910
Celsius.

4531
02:55:25,430 --> 02:55:27,870
My room's like super fucking hot right now.

4532
02:55:27,930 --> 02:55:30,670
I need to like buy a fan for my room.

4533
02:55:30,830 --> 02:55:32,670
I have like a heater for my room, but I don't have a fan.

4534
02:55:44,790 --> 02:55:45,230
I...

4535
02:55:46,090 --> 02:55:46,530
Okay.

4536
02:55:46,630 --> 02:55:48,230
This is LG for reals.

4537
02:55:48,850 --> 02:55:49,770
For real, real.

4538
02:55:50,590 --> 02:55:51,310
I promise.

4539
02:55:58,520 --> 02:55:59,320
One off, bro.

4540
02:56:00,080 --> 02:56:00,700
One off.

4541
02:56:01,200 --> 02:56:01,640
What?

4542
02:56:01,660 --> 02:56:01,740
What?

4543
02:56:01,740 --> 02:56:02,380
What the fuck?

4544
02:56:02,720 --> 02:56:03,860
Am I a full aircon?

4545
02:56:04,020 --> 02:56:08,320
I do, but like, um, my room is literally...

4546
02:56:08,320 --> 02:56:08,700
I...

4547
02:56:09,500 --> 02:56:10,080
It's a box.

4548
02:56:10,380 --> 02:56:11,580
It's like a...

4549
02:56:11,580 --> 02:56:14,160
Anyway, I'm booting up my game back.

4550
02:56:16,920 --> 02:56:17,560
Niko!

4551
02:56:18,600 --> 02:56:23,200
It's like a greenhouse, because there's like five windows surrounding my room.

4552
02:56:24,220 --> 02:56:27,040
Two of the walls is like windows.

4553
02:56:27,880 --> 02:56:30,780
So, it's like literally the sun shines in.

4554
02:56:30,780 --> 02:56:32,620
And then it's a fucking greenhouse.

4555
02:56:33,740 --> 02:56:35,020
So, it's not great.

4556
02:56:35,980 --> 02:56:39,280
You're just like my beautiful flower for real.

4557
02:56:39,760 --> 02:56:40,260
Yay!

4558
02:56:41,160 --> 02:56:42,280
I'm a dying flower.

4559
02:56:46,580 --> 02:56:48,060
Yeah, it's like a sun room.

4560
02:56:48,220 --> 02:56:48,980
It's so bad.

4561
02:56:49,200 --> 02:56:51,960
It's either way too hot or way too fucking cold.

4562
02:56:52,820 --> 02:56:53,740
There's no in between.

4563
02:56:53,960 --> 02:56:54,720
Oh my god, we're here!

4564
02:56:55,280 --> 02:56:57,100
Gumi, you're jump master.

4565
02:56:58,220 --> 02:56:59,160
There's a team here.

4566
02:57:01,620 --> 02:57:02,540
Where are we going?

4567
02:57:02,820 --> 02:57:03,040
Where?

4568
02:57:03,200 --> 02:57:03,560
Are we going here?

4569
02:57:04,120 --> 02:57:04,560
Shitloon?

4570
02:57:04,620 --> 02:57:04,900
I don't know.

4571
02:57:04,900 --> 02:57:05,640
Someone pinged it.

4572
02:57:06,340 --> 02:57:07,320
I guess we go here.

4573
02:57:08,020 --> 02:57:10,300
No one else landed here, so we should be safe.

4574
02:57:14,280 --> 02:57:14,720
Alright.

4575
02:57:14,980 --> 02:57:16,120
LG for real.

4576
02:57:17,260 --> 02:57:17,820
No joke.

4577
02:57:17,820 --> 02:57:19,180
Please, I need to take a nap.

4578
02:57:19,860 --> 02:57:21,640
No joke this time, for real.

4579
02:57:26,200 --> 02:57:28,000
Don't worry, I yelled at Niko for you.

4580
02:57:28,320 --> 02:57:29,000
Oh, you did?

4581
02:57:29,360 --> 02:57:29,800
Thanks.

4582
02:57:30,140 --> 02:57:30,560
Yeah.

4583
02:57:30,560 --> 02:57:31,840
Yeah, but you might as well do it again.

4584
02:57:31,960 --> 02:57:32,800
Teach him a lesson.

4585
02:57:33,560 --> 02:57:34,960
No, I'm a nice person.

4586
02:57:35,720 --> 02:57:37,060
Screw you, Niko.

4587
02:57:38,340 --> 02:57:40,400
Well, who said that?

4588
02:57:40,620 --> 02:57:41,660
Who said

4589
02:57:47,730 --> 02:57:49,990
that?

4590
02:57:50,430 --> 02:57:51,450
Oh my god.

4591
02:57:53,470 --> 02:57:54,970
Was your window open?

4592
02:57:56,650 --> 02:57:58,990
Was your window open, Gumi?

4593
02:58:01,430 --> 02:58:02,710
Guys, I'm scared.

4594
02:58:03,030 --> 02:58:03,730
I'm so scared.

4595
02:58:04,050 --> 02:58:05,030
Don't turn around.

4596
02:58:05,590 --> 02:58:06,070
Don't turn.

4597
02:58:06,070 --> 02:58:06,750
Did you see that ghost?

4598
02:58:07,450 --> 02:58:09,110
Don't look back.

4599
02:58:11,110 --> 02:58:11,770
Kinito?

4600
02:58:12,010 --> 02:58:12,570
Kinito?

4601
02:58:12,570 --> 02:58:13,750
Oh, Kinito.

4602
02:58:17,390 --> 02:58:18,950
Alright, I'm ready to fight.

4603
02:58:19,990 --> 02:58:21,990
Alright, this is LG for reals.

4604
02:58:22,010 --> 02:58:24,170
No more, no more not LG.

4605
02:58:24,750 --> 02:58:25,910
No more fake outs.

4606
02:58:29,390 --> 02:58:30,710
I'm for real LG.

4607
02:58:31,850 --> 02:58:34,330
I've never been so LG in my life.

4608
02:58:38,370 --> 02:58:39,830
Who the fuck scanned this?

4609
02:58:40,190 --> 02:58:41,450
There's people over here.

4610
02:58:42,490 --> 02:58:42,670
Let's go.

4611
02:58:43,230 --> 02:58:43,470
Go.

4612
02:58:43,610 --> 02:58:44,490
Sorry, Niko.

4613
02:58:44,490 --> 02:58:45,530
I'm just cranky.

4614
02:58:45,570 --> 02:58:46,970
I haven't had my afternoon nap.

4615
02:58:47,150 --> 02:58:48,070
Say it in voice.

4616
02:58:50,450 --> 02:58:51,630
Apologize to him right now.

4617
02:58:52,650 --> 02:58:52,850
Niko.

4618
02:58:58,030 --> 02:58:58,330
Die.

4619
02:59:06,920 --> 02:59:08,960
Never do that again in front of me.

4620
02:59:09,040 --> 02:59:10,020
Never do that.

4621
02:59:10,480 --> 02:59:12,580
Never do that again in front of me.

4622
02:59:12,760 --> 02:59:12,840
Oh my god.

4623
02:59:12,840 --> 02:59:14,140
I feel so tired.

4624
02:59:17,760 --> 02:59:18,220
Cracked.

4625
02:59:18,220 --> 02:59:18,360
One more.

4626
02:59:20,080 --> 02:59:21,080
Shatter the prey's shield.

4627
02:59:21,100 --> 02:59:21,540
He ran.

4628
02:59:21,840 --> 02:59:22,300
He ran.

4629
02:59:22,320 --> 02:59:23,500
He's running like a little baby.

4630
02:59:24,820 --> 02:59:25,220
Woah.

4631
02:59:26,560 --> 02:59:27,300
Go, Niko.

4632
02:59:27,440 --> 02:59:27,640
Go.

4633
02:59:28,120 --> 02:59:28,520
Oh.

4634
02:59:32,660 --> 02:59:33,500
Where are they?

4635
02:59:35,340 --> 02:59:36,180
They ran down.

4636
02:59:36,560 --> 02:59:37,960
Did they run all the way down?

4637
02:59:38,300 --> 02:59:39,280
Wait, there's a wench.

4638
02:59:39,620 --> 02:59:41,020
They didn't run all the way down.

4639
02:59:41,120 --> 02:59:41,520
Liar.

4640
02:59:41,580 --> 02:59:42,280
Wait, there's one right here.

4641
02:59:42,380 --> 02:59:42,520
Right here.

4642
02:59:44,300 --> 02:59:44,700
Oh.

4643
02:59:47,220 --> 02:59:47,880
Bumi, no.

4644
02:59:47,960 --> 02:59:48,340
Don't die.

4645
02:59:48,640 --> 02:59:49,600
There's one on me too.

4646
02:59:49,920 --> 02:59:50,740
Oh, I'm dead.

4647
02:59:51,240 --> 02:59:51,640
No.

4648
02:59:52,880 --> 02:59:54,120
I didn't get my one.

4649
02:59:54,180 --> 02:59:54,340
Oh, I'm dead.

4650
02:59:54,980 --> 02:59:55,580
I'm dead because of your run.

4651
02:59:55,580 --> 02:59:56,540
Maybe I'm also tired.

4652
02:59:56,780 --> 02:59:58,060
I'm healing.

4653
02:59:59,180 --> 02:59:59,980
It's fine.

4654
03:00:00,120 --> 03:00:00,560
I believe.

4655
03:00:03,280 --> 03:00:03,880
Look.

4656
03:00:03,920 --> 03:00:04,960
He had a destructor.

4657
03:00:07,720 --> 03:00:14,040
Look, all I'm saying is if I had his same loadout, I would have been alive.

4658
03:00:17,100 --> 03:00:18,560
That's all I'm saying.

4659
03:00:20,540 --> 03:00:22,860
I believe you wholeheartedly.

4660
03:00:23,400 --> 03:00:24,160
No, wait.

4661
03:00:24,220 --> 03:00:24,320
I'm going to lead.

4662
03:00:24,340 --> 03:00:25,800
I swear... watch.

4663
03:00:27,060 --> 03:00:28,620
I'm gonna become the seer.

4664
03:00:30,300 --> 03:00:31,960
Okay, I might be dead cuz...

4665
03:00:33,040 --> 03:00:35,240
Okay, yeah, I'm 100% dead.

4666
03:00:35,520 --> 03:00:38,140
I'm so fucked.

4667
03:00:38,700 --> 03:00:40,440
Please, someone defend me.

4668
03:00:41,450 --> 03:00:41,980
I'm streaming.

4669
03:00:43,500 --> 03:00:44,840
I'm streaming, defend me!

4670
03:00:48,650 --> 03:00:49,630
Where's his loadout?

4671
03:00:52,170 --> 03:00:52,710
Wait...

4672
03:00:53,140 --> 03:00:54,010
Where is his loadout?

4673
03:00:54,030 --> 03:00:54,590
Where is the guy?

4674
03:00:56,190 --> 03:00:57,270
Come here, come here.

4675
03:00:58,810 --> 03:00:59,970
Come here, come here.

4676
03:00:59,970 --> 03:01:01,130
Where the fuck is the guy that killed...

4677
03:01:01,130 --> 03:01:01,550
There he is.

4678
03:01:05,130 --> 03:01:05,530
Alright.

4679
03:01:06,710 --> 03:01:08,150
Who shot us earlier?

4680
03:01:10,530 --> 03:01:11,350
Oh, he's over there.

4681
03:01:17,910 --> 03:01:18,310
Okay.

4682
03:01:19,490 --> 03:01:21,590
I didn't want to fight in zone, but I guess we will.

4683
03:01:22,470 --> 03:01:23,370
I cracked one.

4684
03:01:23,950 --> 03:01:25,130
Well, I'm outside of zone.

4685
03:01:25,150 --> 03:01:27,430
Oh, you guys are so balls deep.

4686
03:01:28,090 --> 03:01:28,490
Yep.

4687
03:01:30,190 --> 03:01:30,750
Um...

4688
03:01:31,630 --> 03:01:33,290
I don't know how...

4689
03:01:33,290 --> 03:01:34,450
They're flush.

4690
03:01:36,670 --> 03:01:37,830
I'm gonna go to zone.

4691
03:01:38,550 --> 03:01:39,630
Wait, what?

4692
03:01:39,990 --> 03:01:41,210
Oh, hey, I got a kill!

4693
03:01:41,950 --> 03:01:42,970
I did that.

4694
03:01:44,170 --> 03:01:45,290
You smile.

4695
03:01:45,770 --> 03:01:46,830
Hey, it was me, smile.

4696
03:01:51,070 --> 03:01:52,370
See, I told you.

4697
03:01:52,410 --> 03:01:55,290
The moment I take this man's loadout, I win.

4698
03:01:56,070 --> 03:01:57,670
Even though he died by ring.

4699
03:01:57,930 --> 03:01:58,490
No...

4700
03:01:58,490 --> 03:02:00,050
He might be...

4701
03:02:00,050 --> 03:02:00,410
He might be...

4702
03:02:00,410 --> 03:02:00,910
Like a me-o.

4703
03:02:01,690 --> 03:02:04,590
I thought he was just gonna take the car and then come back here.

4704
03:02:08,070 --> 03:02:08,610
Oh, wait.

4705
03:02:08,710 --> 03:02:09,730
Why are they all dying to ring?

4706
03:02:10,050 --> 03:02:10,690
Do they not have heals?

4707
03:02:12,490 --> 03:02:13,190
Probably not.

4708
03:02:13,430 --> 03:02:14,130
I guess not.

4709
03:02:17,980 --> 03:02:19,420
Oh, bastards alert!

4710
03:02:20,180 --> 03:02:21,340
Oh, I'm coming over.

4711
03:02:22,200 --> 03:02:23,040
Bastard alert, Nico.

4712
03:02:23,260 --> 03:02:23,760
Get him.

4713
03:02:29,630 --> 03:02:30,550
Where are they?

4714
03:02:32,070 --> 03:02:33,970
Alright, I opened the door so they all know we're here now.

4715
03:02:34,450 --> 03:02:35,330
Oh, shit.

4716
03:02:35,970 --> 03:02:36,850
Wait, where are they?

4717
03:02:37,030 --> 03:02:37,410
Okay.

4718
03:02:39,590 --> 03:02:40,550
Okay, I have white armor.

4719
03:02:41,010 --> 03:02:41,730
I'm a little scared.

4720
03:02:43,310 --> 03:02:46,270
Um, there's that team behind us as well, so we gotta be careful.

4721
03:02:49,130 --> 03:02:49,790
Pushing up.

4722
03:02:52,130 --> 03:02:53,670
Nico just ate one of my shots.

4723
03:02:53,770 --> 03:02:55,490
There's a guy right here in front of me.

4724
03:02:59,160 --> 03:02:59,680
Knocked one.

4725
03:03:02,680 --> 03:03:03,120
Knocked two.

4726
03:03:04,360 --> 03:03:05,380
There's still one more guy.

4727
03:03:06,320 --> 03:03:06,680
Whoa.

4728
03:03:07,420 --> 03:03:08,120
Where is he?

4729
03:03:09,360 --> 03:03:09,720
There.

4730
03:03:09,760 --> 03:03:10,640
See, I told you.

4731
03:03:11,300 --> 03:03:12,020
My loadout.

4732
03:03:12,300 --> 03:03:12,980
There's still more.

4733
03:03:13,100 --> 03:03:13,420
There's still more.

4734
03:03:13,420 --> 03:03:13,760
I know, I know.

4735
03:03:14,020 --> 03:03:14,600
Cover, cover.

4736
03:03:14,680 --> 03:03:14,960
I have gold.

4737
03:03:16,920 --> 03:03:17,620
I knew it.

4738
03:03:17,640 --> 03:03:19,320
I knew my loadout is a he.

4739
03:03:23,630 --> 03:03:24,390
I knew it.

4740
03:03:26,930 --> 03:03:31,370
I don't have any long range, so I require you guys to do all the long range for me.

4741
03:03:33,350 --> 03:03:34,230
Where's your teammate?

4742
03:03:34,430 --> 03:03:35,790
Oh, my God, he's in front of you.

4743
03:03:35,910 --> 03:03:36,970
I can't cancel it.

4744
03:03:37,090 --> 03:03:37,110
Oh, my God.

4745
03:03:40,110 --> 03:03:40,550
What?

4746
03:03:40,550 --> 03:03:42,810
Hey, I'm here.

4747
03:03:45,010 --> 03:03:46,270
Can I get to you?

4748
03:03:46,470 --> 03:03:47,030
Wait, what?

4749
03:03:47,450 --> 03:03:48,390
Is that another team?

4750
03:03:49,110 --> 03:03:51,990
Yeah, the other team was here a little bit too long ago.

4751
03:03:51,990 --> 03:03:52,670
Wait, I hear people.

4752
03:03:52,810 --> 03:03:53,490
Wow, shit!

4753
03:03:56,330 --> 03:03:56,770
Hello.

4754
03:03:58,030 --> 03:03:58,710
There you go.

4755
03:03:58,930 --> 03:04:00,270
I knew it.

4756
03:04:01,110 --> 03:04:02,250
I fucking knew it.

4757
03:04:02,290 --> 03:04:03,730
It's all about this new loadout.

4758
03:04:06,970 --> 03:04:09,770
Oh, I just realized I haven't upgraded at all.

4759
03:04:09,930 --> 03:04:10,590
What do people use?

4760
03:04:10,770 --> 03:04:18,570
Increase attack roll range, gain attack with charge, but have shield regen duration.

4761
03:04:18,910 --> 03:04:21,930
Wait, which one is good for conduit?

4762
03:04:22,450 --> 03:04:24,310
Split charge or radiant transfer?

4763
03:04:24,630 --> 03:04:25,150
Chat!

4764
03:04:25,370 --> 03:04:26,150
Backseat time!

4765
03:04:26,810 --> 03:04:28,350
I haven't had time to learn meta!

4766
03:04:31,610 --> 03:04:33,090
Oh my god, too many.

4767
03:04:34,990 --> 03:04:36,030
Which one?

4768
03:04:41,540 --> 03:04:42,640
Which one guys?

4769
03:04:44,500 --> 03:04:45,540
Probably transfer?

4770
03:04:50,390 --> 03:04:50,910
Getting!

4771
03:04:55,090 --> 03:04:55,830
That one?

4772
03:04:56,190 --> 03:04:56,710
Guys!

4773
03:04:56,990 --> 03:04:58,170
Oh wait, there's someone in front of us.

4774
03:04:58,590 --> 03:04:59,630
There's a team here.

4775
03:05:04,230 --> 03:05:06,790
Oh, I can shield them both in the first one!

4776
03:05:06,830 --> 03:05:07,230
You're right!

4777
03:05:07,610 --> 03:05:08,130
Okay.

4778
03:05:11,880 --> 03:05:13,140
It's a caustic in there.

4779
03:05:13,200 --> 03:05:14,340
I kinda don't wanna go in there.

4780
03:05:14,720 --> 03:05:15,460
It's too late.

4781
03:05:15,740 --> 03:05:16,540
I'm going in.

4782
03:05:17,220 --> 03:05:19,580
Girl, I literally see you walking up to the entrance.

4783
03:05:19,740 --> 03:05:20,320
You can turn around.

4784
03:05:20,960 --> 03:05:21,860
I'm going in.

4785
03:05:23,160 --> 03:05:24,020
I ulted.

4786
03:05:26,720 --> 03:05:27,920
What are you gonna do?

4787
03:05:28,540 --> 03:05:29,200
Kill us?

4788
03:05:31,640 --> 03:05:32,080
See?

4789
03:05:32,280 --> 03:05:32,980
Look, we're fine.

4790
03:05:33,700 --> 03:05:34,140
Oh!

4791
03:05:35,660 --> 03:05:36,100
Whoops.

4792
03:05:40,320 --> 03:05:41,700
Oh my god, okay.

4793
03:05:43,620 --> 03:05:45,680
Oh, there's his ult coming in!

4794
03:05:53,050 --> 03:05:54,610
Come on, get over here, Niko!

4795
03:05:56,230 --> 03:05:57,590
Are they running from us?

4796
03:06:00,190 --> 03:06:01,350
They're running from us.

4797
03:06:03,810 --> 03:06:05,610
Oh, Niko, I don't have...

4798
03:06:06,390 --> 03:06:07,170
Niko, please.

4799
03:06:07,710 --> 03:06:08,550
Niko, please!

4800
03:06:09,530 --> 03:06:10,570
Oh, there's a guy there!

4801
03:06:11,570 --> 03:06:12,010
He's still there.

4802
03:06:12,010 --> 03:06:12,130
I'll run.

4803
03:06:12,930 --> 03:06:13,850
I cover, I'll cover.

4804
03:06:13,950 --> 03:06:14,150
You rez?

4805
03:06:15,970 --> 03:06:16,810
I can cover.

4806
03:06:18,070 --> 03:06:19,630
I cannot cover anymore.

4807
03:06:20,490 --> 03:06:20,970
Here.

4808
03:06:21,370 --> 03:06:22,890
I gave it to the wrong person.

4809
03:06:29,640 --> 03:06:30,720
We knocked one.

4810
03:06:31,340 --> 03:06:32,160
Unless he rez.

4811
03:06:32,260 --> 03:06:32,540
He rez.

4812
03:06:34,260 --> 03:06:35,320
Please, get closer.

4813
03:06:35,440 --> 03:06:36,580
I only have short range.

4814
03:06:39,260 --> 03:06:40,960
I have a Rita plant if we need it.

4815
03:06:41,280 --> 03:06:42,400
We're linched zone though.

4816
03:06:43,000 --> 03:06:43,860
I don't think...

4817
03:06:44,340 --> 03:06:45,320
I'm gonna get a cross.

4818
03:06:47,080 --> 03:06:47,960
Oh, nevermind.

4819
03:06:48,040 --> 03:06:48,860
I can't get the cross.

4820
03:06:49,740 --> 03:06:50,800
I'm gonna bat and you bat.

4821
03:06:51,600 --> 03:06:53,200
You fucking kidding me?

4822
03:06:54,520 --> 03:06:55,380
I'm batting now.

4823
03:06:57,040 --> 03:06:59,020
I'm worried about our backs though, to be fair.

4824
03:07:02,180 --> 03:07:02,980
I knocked one.

4825
03:07:03,680 --> 03:07:04,620
I knocked one.

4826
03:07:04,620 --> 03:07:05,220
62 acoustic.

4827
03:07:06,580 --> 03:07:07,380
I'm pushing up.

4828
03:07:13,530 --> 03:07:13,970
Flash.

4829
03:07:15,150 --> 03:07:15,810
He's running.

4830
03:07:15,810 --> 03:07:17,590
He's running like a little bitch.

4831
03:07:19,370 --> 03:07:20,430
Wait, it's two.

4832
03:07:20,750 --> 03:07:21,690
Oh, I need a bat then.

4833
03:07:22,630 --> 03:07:23,550
He's full running.

4834
03:07:26,050 --> 03:07:26,830
Niko's got it.

4835
03:07:28,470 --> 03:07:29,410
I knew it.

4836
03:07:29,410 --> 03:07:30,410
I could always believe in Niko.

4837
03:07:31,190 --> 03:07:31,970
What are they...

4838
03:07:32,490 --> 03:07:33,610
What are they doing?

4839
03:07:35,310 --> 03:07:36,230
They're so scared.

4840
03:07:36,370 --> 03:07:36,590
Go, Mi.

4841
03:07:36,630 --> 03:07:37,190
Run after him.

4842
03:07:37,330 --> 03:07:37,730
Jump.

4843
03:07:38,230 --> 03:07:39,010
I'm running!

4844
03:07:39,630 --> 03:07:40,070
Jump.

4845
03:07:41,490 --> 03:07:42,310
Where did he go?

4846
03:07:43,810 --> 03:07:44,710
I'm gonna craft.

4847
03:07:44,710 --> 03:07:45,510
Where did...

4848
03:07:46,530 --> 03:07:47,990
Wait, where the fuck did he go?

4849
03:07:50,570 --> 03:07:51,310
He disappeared.

4850
03:07:59,760 --> 03:08:00,640
Wait, what?

4851
03:08:01,800 --> 03:08:02,740
I hear something.

4852
03:08:03,040 --> 03:08:03,600
Oh, there he is.

4853
03:08:04,820 --> 03:08:05,640
Wait, is he dead?

4854
03:08:05,920 --> 03:08:06,820
Oh, he's dead.

4855
03:08:06,860 --> 03:08:07,560
To the ring.

4856
03:08:07,860 --> 03:08:08,300
Dead.

4857
03:08:09,620 --> 03:08:15,080
Wait, that's the team that tried to kill us last time in the original house.

4858
03:08:17,400 --> 03:08:18,860
Do you know what the...

4859
03:08:18,860 --> 03:08:20,100
You know when we were at the...

4860
03:08:20,100 --> 03:08:20,560
The little...

4861
03:08:21,160 --> 03:08:21,800
The towers?

4862
03:08:24,700 --> 03:08:25,600
That was them.

4863
03:08:26,000 --> 03:08:26,880
They just finished the fight.

4864
03:08:26,980 --> 03:08:27,660
They just finished...

4865
03:08:28,380 --> 03:08:28,980
That's the last two.

4866
03:08:29,720 --> 03:08:30,340
Last two squads.

4867
03:08:30,340 --> 03:08:30,740
Last two squads.

4868
03:08:30,820 --> 03:08:31,300
Go, go, go, go.

4869
03:08:31,460 --> 03:08:31,800
I'm here.

4870
03:08:31,860 --> 03:08:32,020
I'm here.

4871
03:08:32,020 --> 03:08:32,320
I'm here.

4872
03:08:32,380 --> 03:08:33,560
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

4873
03:08:35,060 --> 03:08:37,320
I don't know if this is gonna hit, but I'm gonna hell marry this.

4874
03:08:39,040 --> 03:08:40,160
It'll be so smart.

4875
03:08:40,240 --> 03:08:40,860
Trust me.

4876
03:08:43,240 --> 03:08:45,260
It was definitely not close to anybody.

4877
03:08:45,580 --> 03:08:45,600
Did you see me?

4878
03:08:47,100 --> 03:08:47,760
I cracked one.

4879
03:08:48,240 --> 03:08:49,180
The ring's on neighbor.

4880
03:08:52,280 --> 03:08:54,120
I'm gonna go first this guy.

4881
03:08:54,360 --> 03:08:55,500
Oh, shit!

4882
03:08:56,140 --> 03:08:56,780
Anyway.

4883
03:09:01,390 --> 03:09:02,270
Am I left?

4884
03:09:02,430 --> 03:09:03,110
Behind this?

4885
03:09:06,010 --> 03:09:06,790
On me?

4886
03:09:09,110 --> 03:09:09,750
Nice.

4887
03:09:10,850 --> 03:09:11,490
What?

4888
03:09:11,630 --> 03:09:12,810
Oh, that's bad.

4889
03:09:13,730 --> 03:09:14,770
Oh, over there!

4890
03:09:15,090 --> 03:09:15,930
Wait, what?

4891
03:09:17,330 --> 03:09:18,390
What is happening?

4892
03:09:18,810 --> 03:09:19,950
They're super spread.

4893
03:09:21,210 --> 03:09:22,350
That's what's happening.

4894
03:09:23,170 --> 03:09:24,590
Is this shield slugging?

4895
03:09:24,590 --> 03:09:24,910
I'm gonna come up here.

4896
03:09:25,550 --> 03:09:25,990
That's fine.

4897
03:09:26,030 --> 03:09:26,270
I cover.

4898
03:09:26,710 --> 03:09:27,490
Yeah, they're so far.

4899
03:09:27,530 --> 03:09:27,870
They're so far.

4900
03:09:29,450 --> 03:09:30,430
I took the shield swap.

4901
03:09:33,910 --> 03:09:35,410
Holy shit, they're so far.

4902
03:09:36,410 --> 03:09:36,990
Poor guy.

4903
03:09:41,300 --> 03:09:41,900
I'm gonna...

4904
03:09:42,740 --> 03:09:43,460
I'm going in!

4905
03:09:43,600 --> 03:09:43,980
No regrets!

4906
03:09:44,920 --> 03:09:45,360
I'm in!

4907
03:09:46,200 --> 03:09:47,320
Okay, maybe a little regret.

4908
03:09:48,320 --> 03:09:49,160
Okay, little regret.

4909
03:09:49,280 --> 03:09:49,740
Little regret.

4910
03:09:49,880 --> 03:09:50,200
Little regret.

4911
03:09:50,360 --> 03:09:50,900
Miko's got this.

4912
03:09:50,940 --> 03:09:51,400
Little Miko's got this.

4913
03:09:51,400 --> 03:09:52,100
Okay, okay.

4914
03:09:52,680 --> 03:09:53,340
All right.

4915
03:09:54,120 --> 03:09:54,480
I'm in!

4916
03:09:54,480 --> 03:09:54,540
I'm in!

4917
03:09:54,680 --> 03:09:55,040
I'm in!

4918
03:09:55,860 --> 03:09:56,220
I'm in!

4919
03:09:56,220 --> 03:09:57,400
That's huge.

4920
03:09:57,660 --> 03:09:58,520
Look at that.

4921
03:09:58,540 --> 03:09:58,820
Yay!

4922
03:09:58,820 --> 03:10:00,820
I knew this was the real LG!

4923
03:10:01,460 --> 03:10:02,080
Me too!

4924
03:10:02,220 --> 03:10:02,320
Me too!

4925
03:10:02,320 --> 03:10:02,360
Me too!

4926
03:10:02,360 --> 03:10:02,420
Me too!

4927
03:10:02,420 --> 03:10:03,160
We did it!

4928
03:10:03,200 --> 03:10:04,220
Bench time!

4929
03:10:04,320 --> 03:10:05,140
Bench time!

4930
03:10:06,180 --> 03:10:07,460
We did it!

4931
03:10:07,980 --> 03:10:08,540
Yay!

4932
03:10:09,920 --> 03:10:10,480
Goodnight!

4933
03:10:11,080 --> 03:10:11,980
Good night, Goomy.

4934
03:10:11,980 --> 03:10:13,300
Thanks for playing with me.

4935
03:10:13,720 --> 03:10:14,960
See you for Valorant tonight.

4936
03:10:15,500 --> 03:10:15,780
Huh?

4937
03:10:16,420 --> 03:10:16,980
What?

4938
03:10:17,200 --> 03:10:17,540
Huh?

4939
03:10:18,560 --> 03:10:19,120
What?

4940
03:10:19,180 --> 03:10:20,380
For Valorant at 9 p.m.?

4941
03:10:20,380 --> 03:10:20,620
What?

4942
03:10:21,360 --> 03:10:22,200
Oh, bye!

4943
03:10:22,620 --> 03:10:24,200
Sorry, you're breaking up on me.

4944
03:10:24,280 --> 03:10:24,580
Sorry.

4945
03:10:24,660 --> 03:10:26,080
I'm not breaking up with you.

4946
03:10:26,160 --> 03:10:26,200
Sorry.

4947
03:10:26,220 --> 03:10:27,400
Sorry, sorry, you're...

4948
03:10:27,920 --> 03:10:28,780
You're sorry to call.

4949
03:10:28,920 --> 03:10:29,940
There's something wrong with the...

4950
03:10:29,940 --> 03:10:31,300
Oh, beep, boop, beep!

4951
03:10:35,960 --> 03:10:36,480
Hey,

4952
03:10:40,360 --> 03:10:40,820
that was fun!

4953
03:10:41,160 --> 03:10:42,300
I had a great time.

4954
03:10:42,600 --> 03:10:43,820
I really enjoyed it.

4955
03:10:44,060 --> 03:10:45,000
Shoutout to...

4956
03:10:46,040 --> 03:10:47,700
Shoutout to Gumi for...

4957
03:10:48,420 --> 03:10:50,100
playing some games with me.

4958
03:10:50,200 --> 03:10:52,120
And also, we finally...

4959
03:10:52,120 --> 03:10:55,700
we reunited with Niko from four years ago.

4960
03:10:57,200 --> 03:11:01,160
That was actually crazy when he was like, we used to play together in season three.

4961
03:11:01,200 --> 03:11:01,920
I was like, whoa!

4962
03:11:02,360 --> 03:11:05,640
I played with a lot of people in season three!

4963
03:11:08,780 --> 03:11:09,820
Sorry, Niko.

4964
03:11:10,220 --> 03:11:11,480
That was crazy.

4965
03:11:15,340 --> 03:11:18,520
But yeah, shoutout to Gumi for...

4966
03:11:18,520 --> 03:11:19,820
hanging out with me today.

4967
03:11:20,700 --> 03:11:21,220
And...

4968
03:11:22,120 --> 03:11:23,640
It was just really nice to just...

4969
03:11:23,640 --> 03:11:24,180
you know...

4970
03:11:24,180 --> 03:11:26,740
pew-pew and have fun and just...

4971
03:11:26,740 --> 03:11:28,100
not think about...

4972
03:11:28,100 --> 03:11:28,620
anything.

4973
03:11:29,120 --> 03:11:29,920
You know?

4974
03:11:31,040 --> 03:11:32,240
It's just...

4975
03:11:32,240 --> 03:11:33,040
It's...

4976
03:11:33,040 --> 03:11:33,620
It's...

4977
03:11:33,620 --> 03:11:35,500
It was really nice.

4978
03:11:35,660 --> 03:11:36,680
I really did...

4979
03:11:36,680 --> 03:11:37,980
enjoy it.

4980
03:11:38,200 --> 03:11:40,100
But yeah, I hope this was like...

4981
03:11:40,100 --> 03:11:41,980
a nice time to just...

4982
03:11:41,980 --> 03:11:42,660
you know...

4983
03:11:42,660 --> 03:11:45,220
just laugh and have fun and...

4984
03:11:45,220 --> 03:11:47,320
forget about what's going on in the world...

4985
03:11:47,320 --> 03:11:48,360
for a brief moment.

4986
03:11:48,660 --> 03:11:49,800
And I enjoyed my time!

4987
03:11:50,000 --> 03:11:51,280
Thank you everybody for hanging out!

4988
03:11:51,280 --> 03:11:53,840
It really made me...

4989
03:11:53,840 --> 03:11:55,120
very happy.

4990
03:11:55,620 --> 03:11:58,440
Gaming and Apex is such a huge...

4991
03:11:58,440 --> 03:11:59,420
comfort for me.

4992
03:11:59,680 --> 03:12:00,960
Especially when...

4993
03:12:00,960 --> 03:12:01,660
you know...

4994
03:12:01,660 --> 03:12:03,980
when things aren't looking great for me...

4995
03:12:03,980 --> 03:12:04,440
when...

4996
03:12:04,440 --> 03:12:05,340
mentally...

4997
03:12:05,340 --> 03:12:07,680
I really just...

4998
03:12:07,680 --> 03:12:09,120
It's just nice to just...

4999
03:12:09,120 --> 03:12:10,460
hang out with friends and...

5000
03:12:10,460 --> 03:12:11,260
be able to...

5001
03:12:11,260 --> 03:12:11,540
you know...

5002
03:12:11,540 --> 03:12:13,280
play Apex and not forget...

5003
03:12:13,280 --> 03:12:14,380
what's going on.

5004
03:12:14,580 --> 03:12:15,300
And just...

5005
03:12:15,300 --> 03:12:15,660
you know...

5006
03:12:15,660 --> 03:12:16,820
have some fun and laugh.

5007
03:12:17,120 --> 03:12:19,700
And I really appreciate everybody for hanging out with me.

5008
03:12:19,940 --> 03:12:20,420
Um...

5009
03:12:20,420 --> 03:12:21,680
even though this isn't really...

5010
03:12:21,680 --> 03:12:23,580
is not monetized or anything...

5011
03:12:23,580 --> 03:12:24,420
I didn't want to...

5012
03:12:24,420 --> 03:12:26,440
receive any monetization.

5013
03:12:26,800 --> 03:12:28,520
I just want to hang out and...

5014
03:12:28,520 --> 03:12:30,340
enjoy my time with...

5015
03:12:30,340 --> 03:12:30,900
my friends.

5016
03:12:32,740 --> 03:12:33,220
Um...

5017
03:12:33,220 --> 03:12:33,840
But yeah!

5018
03:12:34,080 --> 03:12:35,700
I had a great time guys.

5019
03:12:36,940 --> 03:12:37,420
Um...

5020
03:12:37,420 --> 03:12:38,340
I guess...

5021
03:12:38,340 --> 03:12:38,760
uh...

5022
03:12:38,760 --> 03:12:39,420
Thank you everybody!

5023
03:12:40,040 --> 03:12:40,520
Um...

5024
03:12:40,520 --> 03:12:41,980
As always everyone...

5025
03:12:41,980 --> 03:12:43,340
stay hydrated...

5026
03:12:43,340 --> 03:12:44,500
posture check...

5027
03:12:44,500 --> 03:12:46,620
get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

5028
03:12:46,800 --> 03:12:48,300
And if you stay up for me...

5029
03:12:48,300 --> 03:12:48,920
head to bed.

5030
03:12:48,920 --> 03:12:50,360
Cause you deserve it.

5031
03:12:50,420 --> 03:12:51,720
I'll see you guys next time everybody.

5032
03:12:53,360 --> 03:12:53,920
Bye!
