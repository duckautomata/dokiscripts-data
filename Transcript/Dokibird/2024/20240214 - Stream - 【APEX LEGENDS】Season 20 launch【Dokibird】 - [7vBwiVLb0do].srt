1
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:54,170
Hello everybody!

2
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,490
Hello everyone.

3
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:02,990
We are here for the season 20 Apex launch.

4
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:07,830
Oh, there's a lot of big changes going on here.

5
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:10,370
And despite everything...

6
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:11,790
Sorry, I'm like super rusty.

7
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:14,110
I haven't played Apex in a long time!

8
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:18,030
Oh my god.

9
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:21,330
But a lot of things have changed for this game.

10
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:30,330
I'm like, honestly, I'm like really, really excited to
actually play the official release of it because like I play

11
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:35,870
tested this release a long time ago and I can find it.

12
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:39,130
I've been keeping it a secret for a while.

13
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:44,390
So it's so cool that it's finally in.

14
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:55,090
And for those who are wondering what the biggest change is
like the MOBA shit they did you can your armor is connected

15
00:03:55,090 --> 00:04:06,710
to your upgrades so you can pick one or the other so like
I've seen this for a while now so I'm so I I debated about

16
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:21,510
streaming today but I've I just want a game I just I didn't
obviously use the circumstances I didn't sleep a lot I think

17
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:27,510
I had like three hours to sleep and then I've been awake for
a while now.

18
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:32,550
I was like, do I do what I do?

19
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:44,090
And honestly, gaming has always been like a huge comfort for
me and especially Apex.

20
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:49,850
Apex is like one of my biggest comfort games and like no
matter, oh my god, I'm sorry.

21
00:04:51,350 --> 00:05:04,050
No matter what happens, like I always default to Apex
because it really, oh my gosh, it has like helped me a lot

22
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:13,990
like dealing with my emotions because I just, especially
Apex, because Apex has been always been my ultimate comfort

23
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:17,450
game whenever I'm sad.

24
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:31,210
helped me a lot especially by playing Apex with people and
it really helped me a lot in general so that's why I decided

25
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:39,710
I was like I'll stream Apex and I didn't want to be alone
and I want to say a huge shout out to all my friends that

26
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:54,090
stayed up with me last night making sure I was safe and all
people making sure I was safe making sure everything was

27
00:05:54,090 --> 00:06:07,110
okay so I just want to say I can't really say who they were
are publicly but I just want to say like a huge thank you to

28
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:18,390
all my friends that stayed up with me last night and just to
make sure I had people around so I'd be okay and everything

29
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:20,690
and that's why I stream today.

30
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:28,050
I wanted to stream because I didn't really want to be alone
and I always enjoyed playing Apex.

31
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:37,210
I always enjoyed playing Apex and it's like I said it's
something I've enjoyed doing and always cheers me up.

32
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:50,750
And for those obviously I can't say much about the current
situation because my lawyer is making sure I'm safe.

33
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:53,510
So, um, I can't really say much.

34
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:56,290
For now, I just wanna pew pew.

35
00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:00,570
I have not played Apex in a long time.

36
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:04,370
So, it's gonna be rough.

37
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:09,870
It's gonna be very fucking rough, obviously.

38
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:20,650
So, I'm gonna get shit on, especially when I feel like
there's a lot of, oh shit, there's a lot of of people coming

39
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:32,650
back right now and i feel so rusty at the moment um so yeah
uh yeah anyway i heard like okay i don't really remember a

40
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:39,910
lot of the upgrades but this one was like you can see
batteries and stuff and then increases tactical range gain a

41
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:47,970
tactical charge but have shield regeneration like shit like
that like that shit like you can't find armors on the ground

42
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:58,370
anymore apparently Um, so that, I don't know, I guess like
that makes it so it's less lucky, like it's less RNG, so you

43
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:06,030
can't find armor on the ground anymore, and, uh, it's all
about, like, upgrading your armor, yeah, like, shooting your

44
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:14,450
gun, or, like, finding, like, XP boxes, like, these XP boxes
and shit that will guarantee, like, free upgrade, and stuff

45
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:17,430
like that, or, like, like, abilities or something.

46
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:23,270
Yeah, like this new season is a lot of changes.

47
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:28,650
And apparently rank, it resets everybody to, like, zero or
one.

48
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:29,310
Sorry, one.

49
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:34,670
So every rank starts off at rank one or rank one point.

50
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:36,010
Sorry, not rank one.

51
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:39,710
But, like, starts at one point.

52
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:45,470
So, Preds will be in the same lobby as, like, bronze players
and shit like that.

53
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:49,550
Which is, like, sucks as a bronze players.

54
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:56,870
And then, like, I remember I was telling one of my friends,
I was like, I was like, oh my god, I was like, oh my god,

55
00:08:57,050 --> 00:09:03,610
no, we're gonna, like, what if we, what if we get in a game
with all these Pred players?

56
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:11,730
And then my friend was like, you do know the percentage of
Pred players in the apex population, right?

57
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:19,610
And I was like, wait, and then they were like, yeah, there's
more, there's more gold plat players playing this game than

58
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:19,730
there are.

59
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:33,750
are pred players you do know that right i was like oh my god
wait i forgot pred is one percent of the population so like

60
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:41,750
i was like oh my god there's real people playing this game
it's been you know after being like in sbmm lobbies for so

61
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:49,030
long i forgot there are like actual people that play this
game and not the D-Gen low-lice like me.

62
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:55,990
I was like, oh my god, there's a dad out there.

63
00:09:56,530 --> 00:10:04,410
There's a dad out there who just got home from work that's
booting up his favorite Apex Legends game that's like in

64
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:08,370
bronze right now and then he's gonna get absolutely farmed.

65
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:16,290
I was like Holy shit They exist

66
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:29,730
Look I've been in like SBMM lobbies for So fucking long now
For those who don't know what SBMM is It's like I don't

67
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:33,890

called?

68
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:41,970

like where you're in the lobby with your skill level sorry

69
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:45,630
my brain's not working when you're going around with three
hours of sleep

70
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:59,070
but so I forgot what it's like to play with and against real
people and with jobs who have like nine to five jobs and

71
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:10,310
like is playing this game as a hobby and is also not a freak

73
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:22,210
in rank though like i'm gonna be playing some trios i don't

92
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:40,570
i'm not surprised that the game was like no all right let's
see apex yay all right i guess we're not even gonna i guess

93
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:48,030
the game doesn't want me to play octane even though like i
heard octane's powerhouse were pretty cool i think i wrote

94
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:55,590
from what i remember from the play test it was he gets like
an extra jump or some shit i don't really remember too much.

95
00:14:56,370 --> 00:15:03,290
Alright, so like, I could play Rank, but then, like, I don't
really, I don't know, I don't want to get farmed right now,

96
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:06,450
because every fucking pro player out there is playing Rank
right now.

97
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:09,130
Every fucking streamer and every pro is playing.

98
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:17,650
And like, I know like, they're like 5% of the player base,
but like, it's still, they're still there.

99
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:29,570
If I get into a lobby where it's filled with like bronze
players and they're like the only pro team out there like

100
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:41,650
they're just gonna run it down and fucked me up like it's
five percent is still five percent of the lobby usually

101
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:47,690
usually they'll just run around killing everybody and i
don't want to be part of i don't want to be part of their

102
00:15:47,690 --> 00:16:00,030
statistic all right i'm pretty sure i'll get the five
percent Yeah, I'm pretty sure I'm not really feeling it

103
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:11,930
unless I have a three stack Oh my god, I get to actually
show my badges I haven't seen those badges in forever Oh my

They can play like a team?

128
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:42,310

00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:01,030
But also, why the fuck are you playing Seer?

153
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:02,570
Is Seer OP now?

154
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:04,930
Also, Tony should be the one streamer.

155
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:07,970
I'm just a Tony POV streamer now.

156
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:11,530

00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:11,910

167
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:33,380
Well, I don't give a fuck about Tony anymore.

168
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:41,770
There's no reasons.

169
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:42,730
Oh, shit!

186
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:39,370
I remember this.

187
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:40,690
That shit was so OP.

188
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:47,470
Basically, if I, if I'm in the Bangalore smoke, I reject, I
mean, I'm literally reading what it says.

189
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:48,670
I don't know why I'm through.

190
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:50,510
I don't know why I'm telling you guys.

191
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:52,450
You guys can read.

192
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:55,990
Like, yeah, like, you know, there's smoke.

193
00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:57,750
my HP comes back.

194
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:08,410
So, like, I don't know if they, like, nerfed it or whatever,
but it was so fucking overpowered during the playtest.

195
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:12,710
It was so bad during the playtest.

196
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:15,070
Everyone was just playing.

197
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:24,630
Everyone was just, I remember in the playtest, it was like
my team was, like, Bangalore, Caustic, and Lifeline or

198
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:32,530

00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:01,410
Why do I care about Intel?

203
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:03,430
I'm going to die anyway.

204
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:06,850
Can't believe it.

205
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:08,450
My game crashed.

206
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:09,230
Oh, thank God.

207
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:12,030
I guess the game.

208
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:19,290
The game was like, you don't want to play Pathfinder.

209
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:22,150
I guess you don't have to play.

210
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:24,950
Oh my God.

211
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:29,590
Apex is not what I mean!

212
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:32,210
I still want to play the game!

213
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:35,550
What the fuck, Apex!

214
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:39,250
I still want to play!

215
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:44,490
The game was like, how dare you?

216
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:46,230
I wonder if I'll still be in the lobby.

217
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:47,790
My poor guy.

218
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:49,470
It's alright, he was champion.

219
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:50,270
He can survive.

220
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:52,130
I swear to God, if I load in, I'm dead.

221
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:53,470
Oh, thank God.

222
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:54,630
Oh, this is...

223
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:55,830
I don't like being here.

224
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:58,490
Oh wait, I'm still fine.

225
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:02,690
Oh no, I have my fucking heirloom on.

226
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:05,010

00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:12,510
It's... that's like that when you log back in.

229
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:16,120
Alright, yes, back in the day I used to spend money.

230
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:19,230
Um...

231
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:25,210
And Pathfinder heirloom has to be one of the fucking worst
heirlooms out there.

232
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:35,230
I've like realized because it's so fucking um, it's just so
annoying like it takes up too much at the screen It just

Poor guy.

246
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:22,810
He didn't have stun.

247
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:24,410
Cool gloves.

248
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:24,910
Thank you.

249
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:28,270
It takes up 80% of my screen.

250
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:33,110
It takes...

251
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:35,230
This is why like...

252
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:36,350
Like...

253
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:40,210
Master plus players don't have their heirlooms out anymore.

254
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:42,430
Oh my god.

255
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:43,030
Wow!

256
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:44,250
I guess...

257
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:45,090
Who cares?

258
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:46,350
I don't need Intel.

259
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:48,510
Who the fuck uses Intel?

260
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:49,510
What the fuck?

261
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:50,330
Where?

262
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:52,010
Where?

263
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:54,310
Oh shit!

264
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:55,330
Oh shit!

265
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:55,990
Okay, there he is.

266
00:24:56,010 --> 00:24:56,250

267
00:24:57,150 --> 00:24:58,170
I didn't know he was there.

268
00:24:58,610 --> 00:24:58,910
Wait, what?

269
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:01,830
Did he come downstairs?

270
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:02,790
Where is he?

271
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:05,930
Where is he?

272
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:06,670
Wait, what?

273
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:09,710
I...

274
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:10,270
Oh, God.

275
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:11,190
I'm dead, dead slid.

276
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:16,370
Where the fuck are these people?

277
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:18,750
Oh!

278
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:19,570
It's okay.

279
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:20,770
I killed a TTVer.

280
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:22,670
Come on, Stein.

281
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:23,330
Reach in!

282
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:25,590
Reach in and you're sm- Oh, he's dead.

283
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:36,290
Look, I swear, all I'm saying is that if I was on Bangalore,
I would have lived.

284
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:38,250
I would have fucking lived.

285
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:42,750
Okay, all I'm going to say is that as a streamer, I blamed
my heirloom.

286
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:47,810
I feel like I should unlock all these guys real quick.

287
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:48,670
Let me...

288
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:49,650
I don't unlock again.

289
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:50,750
It's been so long.

290
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:51,770
I don't want it.

291
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:55,990
I don't want it.

292
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:56,810
Look at this.

00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:06,710
There's lore?

297
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:09,710
Okay, that's too much to read.

298
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:10,970

299
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:15,710

Okay, okay, this.

Why would I get to play fucking Wrinkle?

323
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,800
I don't want to play Pathfinder.

324
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,700
But also, please don't crash my game again, Apex.

325
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,340
Please don't do it.

326
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,340
I can't believe it.

327
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,800
I wasn't paying attention.

328
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:25,100
Holy shit, it's so hot in my room.

329
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:27,100
Let me open the window real quick.

330
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:43,600
Holy shit is so high to my room.

331
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:45,590
Alright, I'm back.

332
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:49,030
Are we always going to Fragment again?

333
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:50,410

336
00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:04,350
Oh my god, I actually have like trail, like not trails, but

337
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:08,130
Oh my god, please tell me I'll find a gun.

338
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:10,630

Alright.

00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:06,350

Please, it's one guy!

357
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:49,770
There's no way you get fucked over by one.

358
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:50,570
Okay, there you go.

359
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:53,650
Okay.

360
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:55,130
That's okay.

361
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:57,990
We didn't get fucked over by one guy.

362
00:30:58,130 --> 00:30:58,730
Oh, thank God.

363
00:30:58,810 --> 00:30:59,990
Wait, there's regen now?

364
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:01,170
Oh, my God.

365
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:01,490
Nice.

366
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:03,630
Okay, I got that.

367
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:05,370
My core in.

368
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:08,650
I almost jumped into that.

369
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:09,810
That's okay.

370
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:11,110
I'm slowly...

371
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:13,630
I won't say waking up because I've been...

372
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:17,930
been awake for a long time, but my eyes are not blurring
together now.

373
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:20,590
Oh, thank God.

374
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:23,350
None of these matter.

375
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:26,250
I don't want Pathfinder's like the shittiest upgrade.

376
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:27,370
Like, who...

377
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:28,490
I'm not playing Ring.

378
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:31,270
Alright.

379
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:33,050
Oh, we need zero bullets.

380
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:33,950
That's alright.

381
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:36,190
I never needed my Mastiff, I guess.

382
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:37,730
Did I sleep?

383
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:38,970
That's a good question.

384
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:41,430
I can say that I slept three hours.

385
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:43,510
What the fuck are you doing, Bangalore?

386
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:45,010
You had regen.

387
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:47,630
Oh, we're back.

388
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:50,470
Oh, he had regen, too.

389
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:53,330
Where is he?

390
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:55,070
Wait, he's double regenning.

391
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:55,910
That's illegal.

392
00:31:57,450 --> 00:31:57,690
Wait.

393
00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:01,350
Oh, fuck.

394
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:06,370
I don't know where the fuck he is, but he's just regenning.

395
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:07,770
There we go.

396
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:09,750
No, he's dead!

397
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:12,630
Stop!

398
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:13,490
He's dead!

399
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:16,650
Now I'm fucking stunned!

400
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:21,790
Where is... Oh, wait, they already res.

401
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:22,670
Fuck, okay.

402
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:24,310
Where do I go?

403
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:27,790
What is that?

404
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:29,490
King Evil Harvester?

405
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:31,890
What is...

406
00:32:32,170 --> 00:32:35,030
Where are these fancy buttons on my map?

407
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:36,390
Alright.

408
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:38,430
Wait.

409
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:41,670
Where the fuck is the...

410
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:42,610
That's energy.

411
00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:48,190
Okay, I'm just like, where are all these fancy icons on my
map?

412
00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:49,830
And I'm so confused.

413
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:52,590
Everyone's playing Seer.

414
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:54,990
I wonder what Seer has.

415
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:56,210
That's like so good.

416
00:32:58,990 --> 00:32:59,670
Yay.

417
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:03,110
Oh, I could have.

418
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:04,450
Same do.

419
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:05,410
Wait!

420
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:06,690
Wait!

421
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:13,630
Do I know you?

422
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:19,730
What?

423
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:22,170
Oh shit!

424
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:23,710
This is your fault, Nico!

425
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:27,390
Nico, you fucking swear to god!

426
00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:29,370
Okay.

427
00:33:31,630 --> 00:33:33,350
Nico, you bitch!

428
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:36,830
Oh shit.

429
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:41,430
Okay, I would help you, but like, I'm scared.

430
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:43,490
What does he mean?

431
00:33:43,650 --> 00:33:45,930
What does he mean?

432
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:52,790
The most interesting part is that he said from four years
ago.

433
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:55,970
It's like...

434
00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:57,510
Oh my god.

435
00:33:58,650 --> 00:33:59,670
That's like, oh gee.

436
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:02,190
Who the fuck is he?

437
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:05,110
Ah, fuck.

438
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:06,150
I'm dead.

439
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:08,590
Doesn't matter.

440
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:09,310
I'm dead.

441
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:10,950
Please cover me.

442
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:13,310
Please, I'm just a harm.

443
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:15,610
Harmless Pathfinder.

444
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:18,490
Okay.

445
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:21,130
Alright.

446
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:22,230
I'm okay.

447
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:24,290
I'm okay.

448
00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:28,790
He's not even a dragon because he literally said from four
years ago.

449
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:31,550
That's when you're like super...

450
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:32,470
Oh, fuck.

451
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:37,050
That's when you know you're super OG.

452
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:39,250
I swear to God.

453
00:34:42,610 --> 00:34:43,030
Alright.

454
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:44,230
Please.

455
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:45,830
Please stop.

456
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:48,250
Please stop.

457
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:50,950
I haven't shot my gun.

458
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:56,630
Man, I wish I can regen and smoke.

459
00:34:59,370 --> 00:34:59,970
Alright.

460
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:01,510
I need HP, though.

461
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:06,820
Oh my god, I have no scope for this.

462
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:08,120
Please.

463
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,380
Please, I'm begging you.

464
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,360

468
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:46,360
Fuck it.

469
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:47,800
What's gonna happen?

470
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:48,380

Okay, it's fine.

That's fine.

474
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:54,760
Oh, that's fine.

475
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:55,600
Please thirst him.

476
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,160
For the sake of my HP.

477
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,300
Oh, why did you thirst him?

478
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:03,690
No, I wanted an armor swap.

479
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:05,850
No!

480
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:09,770
Why?

481
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:13,390
I wanted a fucking armor swap.

482
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:14,430
Please!

483
00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:15,110
Please!

484
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:18,370
They're coming!

485
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:20,270
No!

486
00:36:23,770 --> 00:36:24,250
Okay.

487
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:27,070
There's no way he knows I'm here healing.

488
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:28,810
There's no fucking way.

489
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:31,390
They'll kill my teammates first before they kill me, and
that's okay.

490
00:36:32,410 --> 00:36:34,270
That's the risk I'm willing to take.

491
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:36,990
Oh, thank God.

492
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:38,250
There's, like, actual...

493
00:36:39,010 --> 00:36:40,950
There's a fucking scope now.

494
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:42,210
Alright.

495
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:43,570
Nice.

496
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:45,110
Alright, let's see.

497
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:45,850
What can I do?

498
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:47,870
Take 25% less damage.

499
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:57,730
down i mean that seems like the only good thing from
pathfinder that seems like the other one like sucks when

500
00:36:57,730 --> 00:37:09,430
will i ever need to use my zip and like not take damage all
right nice oh hey yes that's what i like to see who the fuck

501
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:23,030
is nico i like how he never even told me who he is I'm just
like who who are you have I played with this guy before a

502
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:35,010
sacrifice I'm exactly as long as the streamer is alive they
get to you know get a little bit of you know Nico there gets

503
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:46,870
a little bit of the the high life you know they need me
alive they need the streamer cam Oh my god, it's the Nico.

504
00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:50,470
You guys don't even know who he is.

505
00:37:50,890 --> 00:37:54,530
The only reason why you're cheering for him is because he,
like, recognized me.

506
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:56,990
So you can self-insert yourself in him.

507
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,560
How the fuck are people?

508
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:05,960
Oh my god, there's five squads left.

509
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:09,360
Like how he's never...

510
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,360
Did he say anything?

511
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,860
He hasn't even...

512
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:15,000
He's never responded.

513
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:17,860
There's nobody here.

514
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:20,060
I feel like we have to go to the zone anyway.

515
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:20,460
Oh, wait.

516
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:21,840
Let me... No!

517
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,880
That's an Eva 8?

518
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:26,000
Really?

519
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,040
Come on, guys.

520
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:28,860
We gotta go.

521
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,580
But I don't want to be the first one over.

522
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:31,760
Oh.

523
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:33,080
Wait, what?

524
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:34,960
Huh?

525
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:36,780
Oh, it's over there.

526
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:38,240
Alright.

527
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:39,960
Let's go.

528
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:42,500
No!

529
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,860
I couldn't get the Eva 8.

530
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,860
Alright, where the fuck are they?

531
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:50,420
Oh shit, there they are.

532
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:51,860
I feel like I'm gonna die from this.

533
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:54,460
Nico, go in.

534
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:55,540

535
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:59,040

00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,500

00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,440
Where was he?

571
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:37,500
How could this happen to Nico from four years ago?

572
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:38,760
Okay, let me...

573
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:39,700
Actually, I'm curious.

574
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,820
Do I actually have Nico on my friends list?

575
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,260
Let's see.

576
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:46,500

579
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:50,740

It's TikTok guy again.

620
00:46:15,930 --> 00:46:18,950
Look, it's because, like, I just didn't have a gun.

621
00:46:19,290 --> 00:46:20,170
What can I say?

622
00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:22,070
Is that actually OP?

623
00:46:22,710 --> 00:46:23,810
What the fuck does Seer have?

624
00:46:24,110 --> 00:46:26,090
Increased passive, faster movement.

625
00:46:26,510 --> 00:46:27,530
Wait, I want to know.

626
00:46:28,470 --> 00:46:29,890
Increased throw range.

627
00:46:30,230 --> 00:46:31,970
Increased tactical scan.

628
00:46:32,510 --> 00:46:33,450
I mean, that's alright.

629
00:46:33,850 --> 00:46:34,950
Is it really that OP?

630
00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:35,770
Wait, is that Nico?

631
00:46:36,430 --> 00:46:36,990
No, okay.

632
00:46:37,210 --> 00:46:37,930
God damn it.

633
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:39,590
I thought you guys actually baited me.

634
00:46:39,670 --> 00:46:43,090
I was like, did I actually forgot how to read and missed out
on Nico?

635
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:47,480
Oh my god, Happy Tree.

636
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:49,320
He has a TSM banner.

637
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:52,020
And he has a 4K damage badge.

638
00:46:57,240 --> 00:47:06,600
to be fair they like nerf controller players hard by taking
up all taking all the configs out thank fucking god the

639
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:14,040
moment they banned all configs like it was like so
noticeable when like games suddenly got like incredibly

640
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:24,060
easier because like all the controller players didn't have
movement anymore it actually got so much easier to play

641
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:29,220
Thank fucking god.

642
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:31,420
It's crazy.

643
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:32,380
Let's see in that video.

644
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:35,860
But all the comics people can use on Roller.

645
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:37,900
It's actually crazy.

646
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:41,340
Where's Nico?

647
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:42,320
He's dead.

648
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:46,360
Oh, fuck.

649
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:47,040
Okay, there's a gun.

650
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:50,340
Would Doki get a gun?

651
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:52,720
I did.

652
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:54,660
Nice.

653
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:57,420
Yuki got a gun.

654
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:00,820
Whoa!

655
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:02,440
Again, already.

656
00:48:04,580 --> 00:48:04,740
What?

657
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:06,520
Where are they?

658
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:10,360
Where are they?

659
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:12,940
She got shot at, but where?

660
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:16,000
Where?

661
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:19,780
Where?

662
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:23,940
I swear to everybody is everywhere but near me.

663
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:26,480
Oh, there.

664
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:29,960
Oh.

665
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:33,560
I heard, like, uh...

666
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:38,060
I heard a Watson fence near me, so I'm gonna slowly heal up
in my smoke.

667
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:40,040
Yay, self-heal.

668
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:43,620
Where?

669
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:46,660
Oh, Seer, please!

670
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:47,200
Seer!

671
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:47,880
Seer!

672
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:51,120
It's fine, we're fine.

673
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:55,520
We gotta help.

674
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:57,700
We gotta help him.

675
00:48:58,400 --> 00:48:58,760
Nice.

676
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:02,360
I'm gonna take that armor swap real fast.

677
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:05,080
Oh, no.

678
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:09,320
I swear to God, I'm forever lost in this area.

679
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:11,040
Oh, new team.

680
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:13,120
Whoa.

681
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:14,800
New team.

682
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:17,880
Let me block this real fast.

683
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:20,040
No, Happy Tree!

684
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:21,640
Don't worry, I got you!

00:53:56,810 --> 00:53:58,210
Woo, it's not fine.

764
00:53:58,470 --> 00:53:59,610

765
00:53:59,630 --> 00:54:01,090
I literally cracked him, please.

766
00:54:02,530 --> 00:54:03,290
Nico, yes!

767
00:54:03,470 --> 00:54:04,230

768
00:54:06,830 --> 00:54:07,670
Clutcher kick.

00:54:08,630 --> 00:54:10,450
Clutcher kick, clutcher kick.

770
00:54:10,690 --> 00:54:11,210
Clutcher kick.

771
00:54:11,710 --> 00:54:12,330
Oh, my God.

772
00:54:12,450 --> 00:54:13,770
He has an arrow in him.

773
00:54:13,810 --> 00:54:14,630
I don't have one of those.

774
00:54:17,510 --> 00:54:18,270
Oh, my God.

775
00:54:18,370 --> 00:54:18,890
He can talk.

776
00:54:19,650 --> 00:54:22,390
He's not just a fucking apex bot.

777
00:54:22,510 --> 00:54:23,650
He actually can speak.

778
00:54:24,330 --> 00:54:25,810
He can actually...

779
00:54:27,790 --> 00:54:29,870
He can actually talk.

780
00:54:30,910 --> 00:54:31,270
Wait.

781
00:54:31,990 --> 00:54:33,910
He's kind of moving like a Fortnite bot right now.

782
00:54:34,010 --> 00:54:34,430
I like it.

783
00:54:34,470 --> 00:54:34,710
Wait.

784
00:54:35,110 --> 00:54:35,270
Okay.

785
00:54:35,370 --> 00:54:36,850
I think he has to be mouse and keyboard.

786
00:54:38,250 --> 00:54:41,630
I remember because I only play with M&K players in season
three.

787
00:54:42,330 --> 00:54:44,470
Because controller players never existed back then.

788
00:54:44,530 --> 00:54:44,690
Oh.

789
00:54:45,030 --> 00:54:45,390
Oh.

790
00:54:45,750 --> 00:54:46,190
Oh.

791
00:54:46,590 --> 00:54:46,870
Oh.

792
00:54:46,870 --> 00:54:47,370
Oh.

793
00:54:47,790 --> 00:54:48,290
Oh.

794
00:54:48,290 --> 00:54:48,570
Oh.

795
00:54:49,110 --> 00:54:49,730
Go, Nico.

796
00:54:50,990 --> 00:54:51,330
Oh, my God.

797
00:54:51,410 --> 00:54:52,250
He grabbed me.

798
00:54:52,970 --> 00:54:53,390
Leave.

799
00:54:53,830 --> 00:54:54,270
Just leave.

800
00:54:55,270 --> 00:54:55,770
Nico.

801
00:54:56,250 --> 00:54:56,290
Go.

802
00:54:56,810 --> 00:54:59,170
Put your heirloom away, man!

803
00:54:59,950 --> 00:55:02,050
Look, he earned that fair and square, Gumi.

804
00:55:02,750 --> 00:55:03,530
Oh, no!

805
00:55:04,150 --> 00:55:04,210
Nico!

806
00:55:06,130 --> 00:55:06,810
It's okay.

807
00:55:06,930 --> 00:55:07,310
He's fine.

808
00:55:07,450 --> 00:55:07,850
He's fine.

809
00:55:09,790 --> 00:55:10,650
It's Nico time.

810
00:55:11,190 --> 00:55:12,050
It's me.

811
00:55:17,050 --> 00:55:18,750

That's okay.

972
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:59,820
No, we all know it's Nico's fault.

973
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:01,260
Yeah, fuck you, Niko.

974
01:04:01,340 --> 01:04:01,760

975
01:04:01,780 --> 01:04:02,220

976
01:04:02,340 --> 01:04:03,020
How dare you?

977
01:04:03,580 --> 01:04:07,760
Why are you in our three stack if you're not clutch and if
you're not clutching?

978
01:04:08,780 --> 01:04:09,260
Wait!

979
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:10,280
We're three stacking.

980
01:04:10,340 --> 01:04:11,300
We should play rank.

981
01:04:11,860 --> 01:04:13,720
We're all... You literally...

982
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:15,540
We should play rank.

983
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:16,800
Okay.

984
01:04:16,940 --> 01:04:18,960
We can be farming the bronze players.

985
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:21,580
The real bronze... It's like...

986
01:04:21,580 --> 01:04:22,460
Okay, look.

987
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:23,320
Okay, hear me out.

988
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:24,440
The game came out.

989
01:04:24,620 --> 01:04:28,140
The new season patch came out like 11-12-1-2.

990
01:04:28,220 --> 01:04:29,140
Four hours ago.

991
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:32,940
Preds shouldn't be in anymore at that point.

992
01:04:33,780 --> 01:04:34,960
They should have ranked out of it.

993
01:04:35,980 --> 01:04:39,480
I have people from DSG and they're ranking up right now,
surely.

994
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:43,920
Which means all the Preds are playing right now, right?

995
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:44,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

996
01:04:44,420 --> 01:04:46,740
They're all playing, but they've been playing for four
hours.

997
01:04:47,380 --> 01:04:52,260
If they play for four hours, what if they keep inting each
other and they're all still bronze?

998
01:04:52,340 --> 01:04:53,260
There's no way!

999
01:04:53,380 --> 01:04:55,080
Then they're not, then they're dog shit.

1000
01:04:56,260 --> 01:04:56,660
Oh.

1001
01:04:58,160 --> 01:04:59,720
Okay, I didn't say it.

1002
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:01,300
Okay.

1003
01:05:01,780 --> 01:05:07,580
I'm saying if they're still if they're still in bronze Not
even bronze.

1004
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:08,640
They start off at rookie.

1005
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:16,840
We start at rookie because everyone starts at one point Look
if I'm saying if it by in four hours you're still you're

1006
01:05:16,840 --> 01:05:25,100
still in rookie and you're you're professional player that
gets paid to play Apex legends that it's not it's not an us

1007
01:05:25,100 --> 01:05:25,620

1008
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:28,560
It's a you problem It's okay.

1009
01:05:28,680 --> 01:05:33,040
We have Nico Nico, you hand that shit over.

1010
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:35,000
What the fuck, Nico?

1011
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:38,200
Don't worry, we say one thing.

1012
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:39,180
Clutch or jump?

1013
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:39,960
Oh, wait, wait.

1014
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:40,720
Kick or jump?

1015
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:48,260
There you go.

1016
01:05:49,260 --> 01:05:50,380
Oh, my God.

1017
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:53,020
Jump for your game.

1018
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:54,660
Nico, that's not it.

1019
01:05:54,680 --> 01:05:55,500
That's not it.

1020
01:05:56,420 --> 01:05:57,120
That's not it.

1021
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:57,240
That's it.

1022
01:05:58,380 --> 01:05:58,780
Oh.

1023
01:05:59,020 --> 01:05:59,080
Oh.

1024
01:05:59,080 --> 01:05:59,380
Oh.

1025
01:05:59,380 --> 01:05:59,720
Oh.

1026
01:06:00,740 --> 01:06:01,260
Oh.

1027
01:06:02,900 --> 01:06:04,080
All right, here we go.

1028
01:06:04,340 --> 01:06:04,940
Isn't it great?

1029
01:06:05,820 --> 01:06:07,700
Isn't it great when we have a carry?

1030
01:06:08,220 --> 01:06:10,400
I see people here with us, Stokey.

1031
01:06:11,040 --> 01:06:11,480
It's okay.

1032
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:13,160
We have a carry.

1033
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:16,580
He's some guy used to play in season three.

1034
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:18,580
Stokey, they're gonna beat his ass.

1035
01:06:18,780 --> 01:06:19,560
They're beating his ass.

1036
01:06:19,660 --> 01:06:20,100
It's okay.

1037
01:06:20,700 --> 01:06:22,360
As long as not us, it's okay.

1038
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:27,040
Oh, shit.

1039
01:06:27,140 --> 01:06:28,200
Maybe we should help him.

1040
01:06:28,860 --> 01:06:29,400
Coming over.

1041
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:33,720
Oh shit, Diko.

1042
01:06:34,020 --> 01:06:34,080

1043
01:06:34,540 --> 01:06:35,200
Oh, he's got him.

1044
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:37,360
Diko, don't die, because I need ammo.

1045
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:40,400
Don't die, because I... Damn.

1046
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:43,720
Wait, where's his... Where's the third?

1047
01:06:45,420 --> 01:06:48,620
Where the fuck is the third player?

1048
01:06:48,980 --> 01:06:50,120
There's fuckers!

1049
01:06:51,820 --> 01:06:52,360

01:06:52,560 --> 01:06:53,340
Oh, go me!

1051
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:54,000

It's the... It's the fucker!

1053
01:06:57,500 --> 01:06:58,320

01:06:58,780 --> 01:06:59,880
Oh, I was you.

1055
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:01,760
Don't worry, Niko's got this.

1057
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:04,180

1063
01:07:13,020 --> 01:07:13,340

Nice.

1086
01:09:12,460 --> 01:09:14,480
I feel like it's so cluttered, though.

1087
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:17,680
Like, all the words on my screen.

1088
01:09:18,900 --> 01:09:19,280
Yeah.

1089
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:22,560
I don't know how to read, so it's a... See nearby ordinance.

1090
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:23,860
I don't need names.

1091
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:26,600
It just feels so cluttered.

1092
01:09:27,900 --> 01:09:29,880
This Nico single.

1093
01:09:31,540 --> 01:09:32,360
Alright, Who wants me to ask?

1094
01:09:32,360 --> 01:09:34,760
Guys, we don't even know how old he is, man.

1095
01:09:35,140 --> 01:09:36,560
Hold on, wait a minute.

1096
01:09:36,940 --> 01:09:39,940
First off, we gotta ask how old Nico is.

1097
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:41,720
First off.

1098
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:44,140
Why is that?

1099
01:09:44,580 --> 01:09:50,920
Before we ask if anybody is single, we need to know how old
Nico is.

1100
01:09:51,780 --> 01:09:51,860
Guys.

1101
01:10:00,260 --> 01:10:03,900
So remember, Remember, the order of the questions matter,
guys.

1102
01:10:04,360 --> 01:10:05,820
The order of the questions.

1103
01:10:06,680 --> 01:10:09,020
Guys, I know Valentine's is tomorrow, but remember.

1104
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:11,060
Order of questions.

1105
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:12,200
Order of operations.

1106
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:14,580
At least four.

1107
01:10:15,420 --> 01:10:18,740
A truth.

1108
01:10:21,220 --> 01:10:24,360
Nico, that's the fucking child prodigy thing.

1109
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:25,980
Apex in the fucking womb.

1110
01:10:26,580 --> 01:10:27,720
Fucking genius.

1111
01:10:28,340 --> 01:10:28,980
Oh my god.

1112
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:30,880
He's like that 10-year-old Apex prodigy.

1113
01:10:30,900 --> 01:10:32,140
Pred player or some shit.

1114
01:10:32,280 --> 01:10:32,980
You know, there's like...

1115
01:10:32,980 --> 01:10:33,600
What's his name?

1116
01:10:34,260 --> 01:10:35,300
Liffordson or whatever.

1117
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:36,540
What?

1118
01:10:36,820 --> 01:10:42,080
There's like this controller or prodigy Pred player who's
like this like 10-year-old kid.

1119
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:44,600
And his like...

1120
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:46,100
His dad runs his like...

1121
01:10:46,100 --> 01:10:47,280
Oh, there's people on us, I think.

1122
01:10:47,340 --> 01:10:49,180
His dad runs his like Twitch and everything.

1123
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:54,160
And all he does is just play Apex while his dad controls
his...

1124
01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:54,460
Whoa!

1125
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:57,480
You go, go, go, go, go, go.

1126
01:10:57,540 --> 01:10:58,780
Go me, go, go, go, go.

1127
01:10:59,320 --> 01:11:00,180
Oh, go where?

1128
01:11:00,380 --> 01:11:00,660
Here!

1129
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:04,860
See?

1130
01:11:06,180 --> 01:11:06,920
Oh, we got help, Nico.

1131
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,040
Wait, they're resing.

1132
01:11:14,850 --> 01:11:15,290
Where is he?

1133
01:11:15,390 --> 01:11:15,870
Oh, shit.

1134
01:11:17,770 --> 01:11:18,470
Oh, this is dead.

1135
01:11:19,350 --> 01:11:19,790
I helped.

1136
01:11:20,310 --> 01:11:21,410
Yeah, you were there.

1137
01:11:22,350 --> 01:11:22,710
What?

1138
01:11:23,190 --> 01:11:24,370
I threw maids, man.

1139
01:11:24,530 --> 01:11:25,370
Yeah, you were there.

1140
01:11:26,330 --> 01:11:27,890
Yeah, I was there.

1141
01:11:32,530 --> 01:11:34,290
Sometimes I wonder if you're okay.

1142
01:11:34,670 --> 01:11:35,670
And then...

1143
01:11:36,490 --> 01:11:38,070
That was a fucking answer!

1144
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:46,520
Alright.

1145
01:11:47,380 --> 01:11:49,240
Ooh, I can heal myself in smoke.

1146
01:11:50,380 --> 01:11:51,560
Oh my god, we're gonna get our first win.

1147
01:11:52,460 --> 01:11:53,480
I believe in us.

1148
01:11:53,700 --> 01:11:54,420
Don't say that.

1149
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:55,780
We're gonna get our first win.

1150
01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:57,480
Wait, did I grab my shield back?

1151
01:11:57,520 --> 01:11:59,260
Oh my god, it cramps right away?

1152
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:01,960
Yeah, that's the new update, but you only craft once.

1153
01:12:03,740 --> 01:12:04,140
YOLO.

1154
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:13,600

And Nanya.

1158
01:12:38,580 --> 01:12:38,940
Oh, yeah.

1159
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:41,260
Okay, so if we don't look at them, they don't exist, right?

1160
01:12:41,560 --> 01:12:41,820
Yeah.

1161
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:45,100
Ken only has a good day if Barbie looks at him.

1162
01:12:46,140 --> 01:12:47,180
And they're all Ken's.

1163
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:48,580
Even you, Niko.

1164
01:12:49,880 --> 01:12:51,600
Whoa, Niko's just a Ken.

1165
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:53,700
That's fucked up.

1166
01:12:54,100 --> 01:12:55,700
He can be a Barbie if he wants.

1167
01:12:56,960 --> 01:12:59,000
Not if he keeps relinquishing Jump Master.

1168
01:12:59,300 --> 01:13:00,260
Ooh, that's true.

1169
01:13:02,360 --> 01:13:04,120
You make Apex look so easy.

1170
01:13:04,140 --> 01:13:06,060
He thinks I have a Nico.

1171
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:12,160
Nico, I'll sue something.

1172
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:13,000
Go!

1173
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:14,560
Kill everyone.

1174
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:17,420
Akumi and I chill.

1175
01:13:19,220 --> 01:13:20,100
Well, we just chill.

1176
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:22,140
Yeah, they're over here.

1177
01:13:22,380 --> 01:13:22,720
Oh, shit.

1178
01:13:22,820 --> 01:13:23,520
Okay, almost fell.

1179
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:24,600
Oh, rata, rata, rata.

1180
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,040
Uh, how do I climb back up?

1181
01:13:26,120 --> 01:13:27,420
There you go.

1182
01:13:27,680 --> 01:13:28,360
Go, Akumi.

1183
01:13:28,740 --> 01:13:28,740
Go.

1184
01:13:30,300 --> 01:13:31,500
Oh, wait, no, he's all the way up there.

1185
01:13:31,580 --> 01:13:31,900
Bastard!

1186
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:35,300
Oh, wait, they changed this a little bit.

1187
01:13:36,260 --> 01:13:36,720
Whoa!

1188
01:13:39,300 --> 01:13:40,220
Knocked one.

1189
01:13:42,820 --> 01:13:44,060
Oh, right here.

1190
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:46,220
Oh, cracked him.

1191
01:13:47,300 --> 01:13:48,580
Oh, he's grappling away.

1192
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:51,700
Oh, my God, that poor guy.

1193
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:53,780
I just saw him get executed.

1194
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:56,820
Where the fuck is this Pathfinder, though?

1195
01:13:57,780 --> 01:13:58,080
Above?

1196
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:00,500
He's above me?

1197
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:03,600
Oh, oh.

1198
01:14:07,220 --> 01:14:09,720
Oh my god, he scared the shit out of me.

1199
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:11,920
He's like above me?

1200
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:15,560
There's people behind me.

1201
01:14:15,940 --> 01:14:16,480
It's fine.

1202
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:17,200
Whoa.

1203
01:14:17,980 --> 01:14:19,160
Not fine, not fine.

1204
01:14:21,260 --> 01:14:22,240
Oh, where are you?

1205
01:14:22,420 --> 01:14:25,140
Um, there's a guy right here where I'm pinging.

1206
01:14:36,650 --> 01:14:38,750
What the fuck was he doing?

1207
01:14:40,210 --> 01:14:41,110
Watch there.

1208
01:14:41,910 --> 01:14:44,030
Another team is fighting in front of us.

1209
01:14:44,850 --> 01:14:45,590
There's a new team.

1210
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:57,320
My Oshiniko is not single.

1211
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:00,000
Day ruined.

1212
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:01,400
No!

1213
01:15:04,060 --> 01:15:06,020
Oh, I got a heal now.

1214
01:15:06,220 --> 01:15:06,520
It's okay.

1215
01:15:06,580 --> 01:15:07,340
I have self-heal.

1216
01:15:07,660 --> 01:15:08,100
I'm needing.

1217
01:15:12,120 --> 01:15:12,860
Oh, shit.

01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:13,540

Do it.

1228
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:51,880
Rookie.

1229
01:15:52,420 --> 01:15:53,520
Wait, is he rookie as well?

1230
01:15:54,360 --> 01:15:55,120
Okay, thank God.

01:15:55,460 --> 01:15:56,300
Lock us in.

1232
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:00,600
Alright, is Kano it's still strong in rank?

1233
01:16:00,720 --> 01:16:01,520
I don't know what's meta.

1234
01:16:02,160 --> 01:16:03,360
I don't know what's meta either.

1235
01:16:03,460 --> 01:16:04,180
I just like Vantage.

1236
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:06,500
Yeah, I know.

1237
01:16:09,780 --> 01:16:10,700
Okay, okay.

1238
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:11,380
I know.

1239
01:16:11,740 --> 01:16:12,280
It's okay.

1240
01:16:12,720 --> 01:16:15,480
All the It's ranked out a rookie.

1241
01:16:15,680 --> 01:16:16,480
There's no way.

1242
01:16:16,680 --> 01:16:18,200
There's no way we're that unlucky.

1243
01:16:19,740 --> 01:16:23,460
We're gonna be the ones that, like, bone rush all the
players.

1244
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:24,480
Yes.

1245
01:16:25,860 --> 01:16:26,640
Conduit got nerfed?

1246
01:16:26,860 --> 01:16:27,240
Oh, fuck.

1247
01:16:27,380 --> 01:16:28,240
Okay, I guess I'll play Bangalore.

1248
01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:31,560
Apparently Conduit's nerfed.

1249
01:16:32,140 --> 01:16:32,660
Wait, okay.

1250
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:33,560
How about Seer?

1251
01:16:34,380 --> 01:16:35,320
I know I'll play Seer.

1252
01:16:37,460 --> 01:16:38,900
Actually, no, I should play Bangalore.

1253
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:40,140
And that's my comfort pick.

1254
01:16:43,700 --> 01:16:50,080
No, there's no way they had four hours if they can't get a
out of rookie in four hours then why the fuck are they pred

1255
01:16:50,080 --> 01:17:02,580
yeah just think about it it literally takes like five games
to get a rookie if you're in pred if you're a pred player

1256
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:22,180
all right nico take us home nico nico nico come on Haha, I
rejoined at the right time.

01:17:23,560 --> 01:17:24,480
We're dropping Among Us.

1259
01:17:24,980 --> 01:17:25,980
Don't worry, I believe in us.

1260
01:17:26,060 --> 01:17:26,900
You played Among Us.

1261
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:28,000
You were an Among Us player.

1262
01:17:30,700 --> 01:17:31,460
Where'd you're professional?

1263
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:33,140

01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:34,580
Yeah, that's right.

1265
01:17:34,820 --> 01:17:37,320
That's Miss Gumiho, the Among Us player.

1266
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:38,780
Yeah.

1267
01:17:38,940 --> 01:17:41,880

Yeah, I know her.

1273
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:53,400
She was like in the disguise toast lobbies.

1274
01:17:54,200 --> 01:17:56,040
She was a pretty big deal.

1275
01:17:56,460 --> 01:17:56,920
Rookie!

1276
01:17:59,960 --> 01:18:02,460
Wait, were you actually in the toast lobbies though?

1277
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:03,980
Actually, I remember that.

1278
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:06,120

Yeah, she was in the hafu lobbies.

1281
01:18:09,860 --> 01:18:11,520
She's a pretty big deal.

1282
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:13,920
Knox, one?

1283
01:18:14,380 --> 01:18:15,480

Please, I have zero kills.

1289
01:18:54,860 --> 01:18:56,360
I don't want to join in.

1290
01:19:01,180 --> 01:19:01,500
Hello?

1291
01:19:02,120 --> 01:19:03,300

1292
01:19:05,260 --> 01:19:05,920
Okay, okay.

1293
01:19:06,100 --> 01:19:06,940
Oh, wait, I heard someone.

1294
01:19:07,100 --> 01:19:07,660
Wait, where?

1295
01:19:09,160 --> 01:19:09,680
No!

1296
01:19:10,460 --> 01:19:11,740
I couldn't farm.

1297
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:13,620
You should, like, let me tap it.

1298
01:19:14,700 --> 01:19:16,860
Well, that wasn't me who did not.

1299
01:19:17,300 --> 01:19:18,040
Fucking Nico.

1300
01:19:18,040 --> 01:19:18,240
No.

1301
01:19:19,480 --> 01:19:20,060
No.

1302
01:19:21,180 --> 01:19:23,200
We should kick him out.

1303
01:19:23,340 --> 01:19:23,600
Yeah.

1304
01:19:24,700 --> 01:19:25,860
I think so too.

01:19:29,460 --> 01:19:30,800
Lesson number one.

1306
01:19:31,340 --> 01:19:32,480
Always let us tap.

1307
01:19:34,620 --> 01:19:35,920
Hold on, don't say it like that.

1308
01:19:40,340 --> 01:19:41,500
Hold on.

1309
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:44,440
Wait a minute.

1310
01:19:44,540 --> 01:19:46,180
I didn't sign up for this.

1311
01:19:47,100 --> 01:19:47,680

1315
01:20:24,380 --> 01:20:25,420
Where the fuck does that happen?

1316
01:20:26,780 --> 01:20:28,060
On SMGs.

1317
01:20:28,140 --> 01:20:28,140
Wow!

1318
01:20:29,020 --> 01:20:29,520

01:20:32,060 --> 01:20:33,980

01:20:34,300 --> 01:20:35,540

01:20:45,980 --> 01:20:47,720

01:20:50,820 --> 01:20:52,840

1329
01:20:52,840 --> 01:20:54,740

1399
01:23:56,170 --> 01:23:57,050
Yeah, they're fighting hard.

1400
01:23:57,190 --> 01:23:57,830
They're fighting hard.

1401
01:23:57,910 --> 01:23:58,390
They're fighting hard.

1402
01:23:59,690 --> 01:24:00,730
On me?

1403
01:24:02,690 --> 01:24:03,210
Flesh?

1404
01:24:04,410 --> 01:24:04,930
Down?

1405
01:24:05,430 --> 01:24:05,770
Left side?

1406
01:24:05,870 --> 01:24:06,130
Left side?

1407
01:24:08,830 --> 01:24:11,850
Oh, careful of the fucking ball of fire.

1408
01:24:12,690 --> 01:24:12,950
Wait.

1409
01:24:13,290 --> 01:24:13,590
What?

1410
01:24:14,270 --> 01:24:14,990
Oh, nice.

1411
01:24:17,810 --> 01:24:18,330
Flesh?

1412
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:22,320
I'm worried.

1413
01:24:22,360 --> 01:24:24,080
I think they're gonna res my kill.

1414
01:24:25,860 --> 01:24:26,580
Pushing up?

1415
01:24:26,780 --> 01:24:27,280
Hit 63.

1416
01:24:27,780 --> 01:24:28,060
Flesh?

1417
01:24:29,880 --> 01:24:30,820
In front of me?

1418
01:24:30,940 --> 01:24:31,340
I'm pushing.

1419
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:34,240
There's an alt in front of me so I can't push.

1420
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:35,580
Careful, Gumi.

1421
01:24:35,780 --> 01:24:36,360
You're by yourself.

1422
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:38,500
Yeah, I'm chilling.

1423
01:24:38,700 --> 01:24:38,900
Flesh?

1424
01:24:39,100 --> 01:24:40,380
They have a bow check or something.

1425
01:24:40,460 --> 01:24:40,720
You're fine.

1426
01:24:40,860 --> 01:24:41,040
You're dead.

1427
01:24:41,140 --> 01:24:41,400
You're dead.

1428
01:24:41,580 --> 01:24:42,320
Off the river there's him.

1429
01:24:46,060 --> 01:24:46,420
Nice.

1430
01:24:50,540 --> 01:24:51,260
Where's the...

1431
01:24:51,260 --> 01:24:51,440
Oh.

1432
01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:52,080
Oniko.

1433
01:24:53,060 --> 01:24:53,420
Dead.

1434
01:24:53,780 --> 01:24:55,520
Okay, there was another team over there earlier.

1435
01:24:55,660 --> 01:24:57,460
Yeah, I think they resmed my kill.

1436
01:24:57,680 --> 01:24:58,220
I'm pretty sure.

1437
01:24:59,660 --> 01:25:01,520
I'm pretty sure they resed it.

1438
01:25:03,540 --> 01:25:04,060
Let's see.

1439
01:25:04,100 --> 01:25:06,260
Oh, I can regen on my heals now.

1440
01:25:06,520 --> 01:25:06,960
Yippee!

1441
01:25:08,160 --> 01:25:08,640
And loot.

1442
01:25:08,820 --> 01:25:09,420
I love loot.

1443
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:11,440
Oh, in front of me?

1444
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:12,020
In front of me?

1445
01:25:13,700 --> 01:25:14,860
And they're fighting to my left.

1446
01:25:16,040 --> 01:25:16,360
Yeah, yeah.

1447
01:25:16,920 --> 01:25:17,860
Right here.

1448
01:25:19,880 --> 01:25:20,760
I'm pushing.

1449
01:25:21,900 --> 01:25:22,740
I'm madding.

1450
01:25:25,660 --> 01:25:26,040
Oh my god.

1451
01:25:27,140 --> 01:25:28,140
Oh, he's one!

1452
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:30,220
I fucked up my aim there.

1453
01:25:31,200 --> 01:25:33,220
There's a guy behind this box, that's low.

1454
01:25:34,280 --> 01:25:34,940
Or he healed.

1455
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:37,120
There's a guy right behind this too.

1456
01:25:40,120 --> 01:25:41,300
Oh nice, they got the key.

1457
01:25:43,100 --> 01:25:44,300
It's a team of blue armors.

1458
01:25:45,340 --> 01:25:46,140
Yeah, it's just a seer.

1459
01:25:47,540 --> 01:25:49,080
There's a team on my right as well.

1460
01:25:51,300 --> 01:25:52,300
You should be fine.

1461
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:53,820
Yeah.

1462
01:25:54,080 --> 01:25:55,640
I think we have to go to zone soon though.

1463
01:25:55,660 --> 01:25:56,740
You know what?

1464
01:25:57,340 --> 01:25:57,580
Fuck you.

1465
01:25:58,580 --> 01:25:59,240
Are they resing?

1466
01:25:59,240 --> 01:25:59,860
Are they resing?

1467
01:26:00,440 --> 01:26:01,480
All right, I'm finishing.

1468
01:26:04,260 --> 01:26:04,720
Nice.

1469
01:26:06,640 --> 01:26:07,860
I made a statement.

1470
01:26:09,560 --> 01:26:11,140
I think there's like people in front of me though.

1471
01:26:12,060 --> 01:26:12,860
I'm right behind you.

1472
01:26:13,340 --> 01:26:14,040
Yeah, there's a res.

1473
01:26:15,480 --> 01:26:16,120
Res in front.

1474
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:19,520
Whoa!

1475
01:26:20,620 --> 01:26:21,140
Helting?

1476
01:26:22,160 --> 01:26:22,980
Fishing this?

1477
01:26:24,340 --> 01:26:25,580
This is like nonstop.

1478
01:26:25,660 --> 01:26:25,980
fighting.

1479
01:26:26,260 --> 01:26:26,980
I love this, Evo.

1480
01:26:27,860 --> 01:26:29,040
Oh, I'm going to ult it myself.

1481
01:26:29,160 --> 01:26:30,280
Can't push anymore.

1482
01:26:31,080 --> 01:26:31,900
Yeah, I saw that.

1483
01:26:32,900 --> 01:26:34,580
I was a bit crazy about it, but I didn't.

1484
01:26:35,280 --> 01:26:36,400
Look, I forgot.

1485
01:26:38,620 --> 01:26:40,600
But they just ran.

1486
01:26:40,760 --> 01:26:42,660
Look, they're just running away.

1487
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:45,820
Not there.

1488
01:26:46,160 --> 01:26:46,900
Do we have redeploy?

1489
01:26:49,160 --> 01:26:49,760
Redeploy.

1490
01:26:51,420 --> 01:26:53,260
I spelled redeploy wrong.

1491
01:26:54,100 --> 01:26:54,700
Redeploy.

1492
01:26:55,160 --> 01:26:55,380
Now.

1493
01:26:58,220 --> 01:26:59,400
Where's our redeploy?

1494
01:27:02,580 --> 01:27:04,780
Nico, you literally have redeploy!

1495
01:27:09,020 --> 01:27:10,220
Oh my god.

1496
01:27:10,340 --> 01:27:11,460
God damn it, Nico.

1497
01:27:12,180 --> 01:27:12,520
Okay.

1498
01:27:14,100 --> 01:27:15,180
We need a zone, though.

1499
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:16,780
Yeah, they went up.

1500
01:27:17,020 --> 01:27:17,960
Yeah, they have high ground.

1501
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:19,540
I'm pushing up.

1502
01:27:19,620 --> 01:27:20,260
Nico, it's all your fault.

1503
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:21,160
This is all your fault.

1504
01:27:21,220 --> 01:27:21,940
I said redeploy.

1505
01:27:22,820 --> 01:27:24,400
I said one simple word.

1506
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:25,560
Okay.

1507
01:27:25,660 --> 01:27:27,060
He did say that.

1508
01:27:27,340 --> 01:27:27,780
I heard it.

1509
01:27:28,040 --> 01:27:28,940
Yeah, I heard it too.

1510
01:27:29,960 --> 01:27:31,120
We all heard it.

1511
01:27:31,480 --> 01:27:32,480
Yep, we all heard it.

1512
01:27:35,020 --> 01:27:37,420
I'm going to take the bonsai platform.

1513
01:27:39,200 --> 01:27:40,680
Deploy or kick.

1514
01:27:42,580 --> 01:27:44,140
Oh, there he is.

1515
01:27:47,640 --> 01:27:48,920
There's his teammate, though.

1516
01:27:51,660 --> 01:27:53,160
What's your real ring?

1517
01:27:53,700 --> 01:27:56,340
Mr. Mr. Loba.

1518
01:27:57,300 --> 01:27:59,140
Can I farm you?

1519
01:27:59,660 --> 01:28:00,700
Let's see.

1520
01:28:01,860 --> 01:28:02,500
Go, Nico.

1521
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:04,780
Tell us what their rank is if they can shoot you.

1522
01:28:09,210 --> 01:28:10,490
Won't know if they can aim.

1523
01:28:11,850 --> 01:28:12,930
I'm gonna go to the right.

1524
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:17,600
Knock.

1525
01:28:19,360 --> 01:28:21,500
What the fuck are they doing?

1526
01:28:22,440 --> 01:28:22,800
Flesh?

1527
01:28:24,700 --> 01:28:25,740
Oh, he's dead.

1528
01:28:26,260 --> 01:28:27,220
Oh, goodbye!

1529
01:28:28,020 --> 01:28:28,900
There he is.

1530
01:28:29,140 --> 01:28:29,920
He's gone.

1531
01:28:30,180 --> 01:28:30,780
It's fine.

1532
01:28:33,700 --> 01:28:37,300
That is not my ult, by the way, so...

1533
01:28:37,860 --> 01:28:40,540
That could be a different team's ult.

1534
01:28:46,460 --> 01:28:47,400
I need ammo, actually.

1535
01:28:47,580 --> 01:28:48,620
No land energy?

1536
01:28:49,640 --> 01:28:49,980
Fuck.

1537
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:52,640
Where's the other guy we killed?

1538
01:28:53,800 --> 01:28:56,180
Uh, I can drop you 16 energy right here.

1539
01:28:56,400 --> 01:28:56,940
Yeah, I need it.

1540
01:28:57,360 --> 01:28:58,000
There's a new team.

1541
01:28:58,920 --> 01:28:59,760
In front of us.

1542
01:29:01,220 --> 01:29:01,980
Now you're not fighting.

1543
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:03,800
Yeah, you're literally right in front.

1544
01:29:04,500 --> 01:29:04,980
Hard fighting?

1545
01:29:05,260 --> 01:29:05,280
Hard fighting?

1546
01:29:07,260 --> 01:29:07,740
Oh!

1547
01:29:10,720 --> 01:29:11,860
Sorry, I don't know if it's 40.

1548
01:29:11,960 --> 01:29:12,660
I made up the number.

1549
01:29:13,400 --> 01:29:13,600
Okay.

1550
01:29:16,100 --> 01:29:17,280
Oh, look him go!

1551
01:29:19,160 --> 01:29:19,640
Flesh.

1552
01:29:22,580 --> 01:29:22,960
Huh?

1553
01:29:23,380 --> 01:29:24,000
I'm just gonna...

1554
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:25,980
Yeah, I'm gonna fucking head to zone.

1555
01:29:26,780 --> 01:29:27,280
Oh, hey!

1556
01:29:27,700 --> 01:29:28,280
What's that?

1557
01:29:29,540 --> 01:29:30,660
Do you even get it?

1558
01:29:30,980 --> 01:29:31,360
No.

1559
01:29:31,720 --> 01:29:32,500
Alright, I'll take you.

1560
01:29:32,500 --> 01:29:33,620
I was running out anyway.

1561
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:37,500
I was running out of ammo.

1562
01:29:38,900 --> 01:29:39,500
Might as well.

1563
01:29:40,940 --> 01:29:41,560
Wait, what?

1564
01:29:42,340 --> 01:29:43,160
He needed us.

1565
01:29:44,780 --> 01:29:45,740
Who is it?

1566
01:29:46,940 --> 01:29:48,380
Oh, there was another scan.

1567
01:29:50,100 --> 01:29:52,100
Wasn't you or Nico that punched me?

1568
01:29:52,940 --> 01:29:54,140
Look where I am.

1569
01:29:55,080 --> 01:29:56,700
Like, what do you think?

1570
01:29:57,360 --> 01:29:59,100
I'm so far from you.

1571
01:29:59,820 --> 01:30:01,200
We need to go to his own, though.

1572
01:30:02,740 --> 01:30:03,740
I am heading down.

1573
01:30:07,090 --> 01:30:07,570
Mr. Burns.

1574
01:30:07,690 --> 01:30:08,590
zone.

1575
01:30:09,630 --> 01:30:10,250
Super Nico.

1576
01:30:11,190 --> 01:30:11,910
Let me...

1577
01:30:11,910 --> 01:30:12,410
No!

1578
01:30:13,190 --> 01:30:16,050
If he was a real gamer, he would have a fucking bottle.

1579
01:30:18,430 --> 01:30:20,290
That's called the streamer life.

1580
01:30:25,460 --> 01:30:26,680
What would be great about...

1581
01:30:27,680 --> 01:30:29,300
Next merch idea.

1582
01:30:32,360 --> 01:30:34,340
The gamer bottle.

1583
01:30:35,680 --> 01:30:36,080
Ew.

Oh, that's guy.

1599
01:31:36,650 --> 01:31:38,210
He's, like, literally one guy.

1600
01:31:42,950 --> 01:31:43,530
Oh, army?

1601
01:31:45,250 --> 01:31:45,930

01:31:46,790 --> 01:31:49,630
Cracked the bloodhound in front of us.

1603
01:31:54,670 --> 01:31:55,430
Cracked him?

1604
01:31:55,970 --> 01:31:56,190

1605
01:31:58,250 --> 01:31:58,950
Cracked him?

01:31:59,270 --> 01:31:59,670
He's cracked.

1607
01:32:02,990 --> 01:32:05,350
Okay, but I'm not letting this guy rise, though.

1608
01:32:05,990 --> 01:32:09,550
Let, uh, crack 10-5?

1609
01:32:11,090 --> 01:32:11,810
Is this the last guy?

1610
01:32:12,310 --> 01:32:12,350
Yeah!

1611
01:32:13,410 --> 01:32:14,430
I told you!

1612
01:32:14,750 --> 01:32:16,090
We won in New York!

1613
01:32:16,530 --> 01:32:19,090
I told you, rank is so easy to farm.

1614
01:32:19,110 --> 01:32:27,770
These are farm to fucking pause Told you so easy What the
fuck?

1615
01:32:32,890 --> 01:32:40,030
Now what happened my screen Oh, yeah, nice.

I'm such a triple wasn't that epic.

1617
01:32:43,110 --> 01:32:50,790
Oh, yeah, the triple take is nerfed as hell Dude, you just
don't want me to play this game Oh my god, how much do we,

1618
01:32:50,910 --> 01:32:52,350
how many points did we gain there?

1619
01:32:53,710 --> 01:32:59,970
425, I told you, it literally takes like four to five games
for a prayer to like get out of rookie.

1620
01:33:00,150 --> 01:33:01,650
For literally rookie three.

1621
01:33:02,210 --> 01:33:02,490
Oh.

1622
01:33:05,590 --> 01:33:06,070
Oh.

1623
01:33:06,070 --> 01:33:07,510
It was a legendary frame.

1624
01:33:07,790 --> 01:33:13,530
It was, it literally took us like one game to get to rookie,
almost to rookie two.

1625
01:33:14,470 --> 01:33:16,450
Please, I want to stay in rookie forever.

1626
01:33:16,910 --> 01:33:18,130
Please, it's so fun.

1627
01:33:19,110 --> 01:33:21,850
It's like, OG, OG pubs.

1628
01:33:23,670 --> 01:33:24,150
It's okay.

1629
01:33:24,350 --> 01:33:25,630
He can, like, speed ruin.

1630
01:33:26,670 --> 01:33:27,610
He's a man.

1631
01:33:37,700 --> 01:33:38,140
It's alright.

1632
01:33:38,500 --> 01:33:39,000
Look at that!

1633
01:33:39,240 --> 01:33:39,800

01:33:44,720 --> 01:33:45,900
Yeah, I'm proud.

1637
01:33:49,970 --> 01:33:51,490
We did it.

1638
01:33:51,610 --> 01:33:52,170
Yay!

1639
01:33:53,630 --> 01:33:54,190
Yay!

1640
01:33:54,190 --> 01:33:54,650
Yippee!

1641
01:33:55,050 --> 01:33:55,730
We did it!

1642
01:33:55,930 --> 01:33:56,290
Yay!

1643
01:34:00,090 --> 01:34:03,890
Are you gonna let Nico join the voice chat girls only?

1644
01:34:06,270 --> 01:34:10,870
No men allow Yeah, my game crashed

1645
01:34:17,310 --> 01:34:23,810
Guys, I don't think my game can keep my only the game likes

01:35:02,810 --> 01:35:04,730
Oh, there's someone!

01:35:06,990 --> 01:35:08,270
It's okay, just kill him!

1651
01:35:09,330 --> 01:35:10,110
What are you afraid of?

1652
01:35:11,030 --> 01:35:11,750
Oh, goomy!

1653
01:35:12,990 --> 01:35:13,930

Goomy, what happened?

1655
01:35:15,150 --> 01:35:16,310
What do you mean?

1656
01:35:16,510 --> 01:35:20,250
I think these guys are gamers now.

1657
01:35:20,410 --> 01:35:21,610
They're not regular rookies.

1658
01:35:24,230 --> 01:35:25,430
They're not regular rookie players.

1659
01:35:25,550 --> 01:35:26,890
Oh, I don't have frames right now.

1660
01:35:28,050 --> 01:35:28,330
Woo!

1661
01:35:28,810 --> 01:35:29,630
Okay, now I have frames.

1662
01:35:29,630 --> 01:35:30,130
Whoa!

1663
01:35:30,450 --> 01:35:31,630
There's another...

1664
01:35:33,490 --> 01:35:35,050
There's another team!

1665
01:35:36,370 --> 01:35:37,210
That's why we don't let Niko.

1666
01:35:38,030 --> 01:35:39,450
This is why this is Niko's fault.

1667
01:35:40,570 --> 01:35:40,810
Yeah.

1668
01:35:41,490 --> 01:35:42,110
I blame Niko.

1669
01:35:45,030 --> 01:35:45,950
I blame Niko.

1670
01:35:46,090 --> 01:35:46,630
Yeah, Niko just got owned.

1671
01:35:46,810 --> 01:35:47,590
What's wrong with you, Niko?

1672
01:35:47,810 --> 01:35:48,510
Yeah, what's wrong with you?

1673
01:35:49,830 --> 01:35:50,230
Anyways.

1674
01:35:51,870 --> 01:35:52,690
What's wrong with you, Niko?

1675
01:35:52,810 --> 01:35:53,370
This is your fault.

1676
01:35:53,610 --> 01:35:53,670
Oh!

1677
01:35:53,890 --> 01:35:54,750
Whoa, he has teammates?

1678
01:36:01,450 --> 01:36:04,150
teammates, I wouldn't have died.

1679
01:36:08,430 --> 01:36:10,110
My rookie boys!

1680
01:36:11,810 --> 01:36:12,310
I'm good.

1681
01:36:12,490 --> 01:36:13,630
I'm good now.

1682
01:36:16,510 --> 01:36:17,110
Okay.

1683
01:36:17,650 --> 01:36:19,170
Look, we blame Nico, right?

1684
01:36:20,210 --> 01:36:20,670
Yep.

1685
01:36:20,930 --> 01:36:21,190
Yeah.

1686
01:36:21,650 --> 01:36:21,850
Yeah.

1687
01:36:22,810 --> 01:36:25,610
He doesn't have a voice so we can blame him.

1688
01:36:29,850 --> 01:36:31,890
No, there's no MMR.

1689
01:36:32,270 --> 01:36:36,290
We just landed somewhere that had actual good players.

1690
01:36:36,790 --> 01:36:37,710
Oh wait, we're on trios.

1691
01:36:38,210 --> 01:36:39,350
Wait, were we not in rank?

1692
01:36:39,590 --> 01:36:39,930
Were we?

1693
01:36:40,390 --> 01:36:41,050
No, we were.

1694
01:36:42,630 --> 01:36:43,050
No!

1695
01:36:43,430 --> 01:36:43,790
Gumi!

1696
01:36:45,590 --> 01:36:47,450
Gumi, take us back!

1697
01:36:48,470 --> 01:36:50,470
Take us back to rank.

1698
01:36:50,690 --> 01:36:52,390
It was so much more fun.

1699
01:36:53,470 --> 01:36:53,970
My bad.

1700
01:36:54,090 --> 01:36:55,230
I went to go get a Shumai.

1701
01:36:55,530 --> 01:36:56,030
Oh, nice.

1702
01:36:56,150 --> 01:36:56,850
How is it?

1703
01:36:57,610 --> 01:36:58,270
It's cold.

1704
01:36:59,370 --> 01:36:59,790
Nice.

1705
01:36:59,970 --> 01:37:00,570
Not nice.

1706
01:37:01,290 --> 01:37:03,250
Does this bring Miko?

1707
01:37:05,190 --> 01:37:07,250
Let him speak.

1708
01:37:10,250 --> 01:37:12,970
Dude, I don't want to hear it.

1709
01:37:15,510 --> 01:37:22,310
If he wanted to talk to us, he could have used the open VC
in the game.

1710
01:37:24,190 --> 01:37:24,630
Right?

1711
01:37:24,870 --> 01:37:27,570
What's stopping him from using that?

1712
01:37:28,670 --> 01:37:29,350
Exactly.

1713
01:37:29,810 --> 01:37:30,210
Yeah.

1714
01:37:31,290 --> 01:37:34,310
Even if Nico were here, do you think he could talk over us?

1715
01:37:34,590 --> 01:37:35,590
Do you hear us?

1716
01:37:38,090 --> 01:37:39,210
True, true.

1717
01:37:39,810 --> 01:37:41,550
I don't even hear my own thoughts.

1718
01:37:45,550 --> 01:37:47,370
Let Nico speak.

1719
01:37:54,490 --> 01:37:59,790
This Gumiho, the real Gumiho, yes, the among us Minecraft
Gumiho.

1720
01:38:01,610 --> 01:38:02,050
Valorant.

1721
01:38:02,470 --> 01:38:04,450
Hey, can we change how you introduce me?

1722
01:38:05,050 --> 01:38:06,510
Oh, sorry.

1723
01:38:06,830 --> 01:38:07,810
The Minecrafters.

1724
01:38:08,090 --> 01:38:08,730
Is that...

1725
01:38:08,730 --> 01:38:09,290
Is that...

1726
01:38:13,750 --> 01:38:14,190
No!

1727
01:38:14,190 --> 01:38:14,650
Mike and Crash.

1728
01:38:14,850 --> 01:38:16,210
Why are you fucking kidding?

1729
01:38:17,570 --> 01:38:18,010
I...

1730
01:38:18,010 --> 01:38:18,530
What?

1731
01:38:20,350 --> 01:38:22,590
Oh, I guess we gotta swap to Mel right now.

1732
01:38:22,830 --> 01:38:25,030
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1733
01:38:25,030 --> 01:38:26,190
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1734
01:38:26,330 --> 01:38:26,870
Give me a sec.

1735
01:38:26,970 --> 01:38:27,750
I'm coming back.

1736
01:38:28,230 --> 01:38:29,630
I'm coming back right now.

1737
01:38:30,410 --> 01:38:31,270
Give me a sec.

1738
01:38:33,050 --> 01:38:34,270
Okay, here we go.

1739
01:38:35,590 --> 01:38:35,950
Nice, okay.

1740
01:38:36,710 --> 01:38:38,450
All right, for some reason it's windowed now.

1741
01:38:38,590 --> 01:38:39,290
That's not great.

1742
01:38:41,370 --> 01:38:42,930
I don't know why I keep crashing.

1743
01:38:44,050 --> 01:38:49,010
See, fair, every Apex update fucks up the PC one way or
another.

1744
01:38:51,310 --> 01:38:53,070
Okay, just don't let me die.

1745
01:38:53,450 --> 01:38:53,770
Please.

1746
01:38:55,930 --> 01:38:56,790
Nicholas landing us.

1747
01:38:56,950 --> 01:38:57,730
There's one squad.

1748
01:38:57,870 --> 01:39:00,870
Okay, let me make sure we're not windowed.

1749
01:39:02,450 --> 01:39:03,490
Alright, I'm good.

1750
01:39:04,670 --> 01:39:07,370
I'm gonna have shit frames for one second.

1751
01:39:08,750 --> 01:39:09,370
Uh...

1752
01:39:11,090 --> 01:39:13,790
We don't have people contesting us now.

1753
01:39:14,150 --> 01:39:15,510
No, they're far.

1754
01:39:17,210 --> 01:39:17,590
Oh hey.

1755
01:39:18,610 --> 01:39:19,190

01:51:41,260 --> 01:51:42,260
fucking teammate.

1933
01:51:43,340 --> 01:51:44,820
Oh, they're on the building.

1934
01:51:45,360 --> 01:51:46,480
Wait, they stole our building?

1935
01:51:50,340 --> 01:51:51,460
Okay, we're good.

1936
01:51:53,540 --> 01:51:54,380
Why is there on me?

1937
01:51:55,180 --> 01:51:55,980
I'm heading over?

1938
01:51:56,400 --> 01:51:57,980
Here, my game crash!

1939
01:51:58,420 --> 01:51:58,780
No!

1940
01:51:59,380 --> 01:52:00,120
Why is my game?

1941
01:52:00,380 --> 01:52:01,840
Okay, you guys went fine.

1942
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:02,680
Just don't die.

1943
01:52:02,980 --> 01:52:04,040
Just don't die.

1944
01:52:04,320 --> 01:52:04,800
I'm not dying?

1945
01:52:05,500 --> 01:52:07,020
I just don't die.

1946
01:52:07,960 --> 01:52:08,880
What do you mean?

1947
01:52:08,900 --> 01:52:10,880
Okay, this Apex update.

1948
01:52:11,140 --> 01:52:11,840
No, please tell me.

1949
01:52:11,900 --> 01:52:12,680
Am I still alive?

1950
01:52:13,460 --> 01:52:14,420
Am I still alive?

1951
01:52:16,160 --> 01:52:18,140
I'm coming back in.

1952
01:52:19,100 --> 01:52:19,480
Oh, God.

1953
01:52:19,780 --> 01:52:20,060
I swear.

1954
01:52:20,500 --> 01:52:23,260
This Apex, what do you mean, deserved?

1955
01:52:24,020 --> 01:52:25,600
I fucking, I was clutching it.

1956
01:52:25,680 --> 01:52:26,860
I saved everybody.

1957
01:52:28,700 --> 01:52:31,020
Apex doesn't want me to win.

1958
01:52:31,880 --> 01:52:32,480
No!

1959
01:52:33,140 --> 01:52:34,440
Let me win.

1960
01:52:35,560 --> 01:52:37,040
I was doing too well.

1961
01:52:37,740 --> 01:52:38,160

Okay, as long as I don't look down, we're fine.

1971
01:53:46,160 --> 01:53:48,160
Oh, hey.

1972
01:53:52,400 --> 01:53:53,120
Everything's okay.

1973
01:53:56,500 --> 01:53:57,640
Everything's okay now.

1974
01:53:58,200 --> 01:53:58,620
Wait, what?

1975
01:53:58,920 --> 01:53:59,620
Wait, behind me?

1976
01:53:59,840 --> 01:54:01,660
Oh, I can't look behind me.

1977
01:54:02,220 --> 01:54:05,160
No, I'm so fucking nerfed right now!

1978
01:54:06,180 --> 01:54:07,680
I can't look behind!

1979
01:54:08,020 --> 01:54:09,780
They need to fight in front of me!

1980
01:54:12,740 --> 01:54:13,180
I

1981
01:54:18,820 --> 01:54:22,240
Walk backwards I can't see

1982
01:54:26,920 --> 01:54:27,360
No!

1983
01:54:28,140 --> 01:54:29,420
You guys can't kill him, right?

1984
01:54:29,960 --> 01:54:39,620
Don't worry, I'm coming over Don't worry, if I walk in the
sideways, we'll be fine Don't worry We killed them, we

1985
01:54:39,620 --> 01:54:45,000
killed two of them Okay, I just need to hope that every
enemy shoots in front of me.

1986
01:54:45,780 --> 01:54:46,680
Then we should be fine.

1987
01:54:46,900 --> 01:54:48,960
As long as they're all in front of me.

1988
01:54:50,740 --> 01:54:51,380
Oh, God.

1989
01:54:52,020 --> 01:54:52,980
Oh, God.

1990
01:54:55,660 --> 01:54:56,840
Oh, this is not great.

1991
01:54:57,020 --> 01:54:57,940
The zone's coming in.

1992
01:54:58,320 --> 01:55:00,120
Oh, this is not great for me.

1993
01:55:00,580 --> 01:55:01,540
This is not...

1994
01:55:01,540 --> 01:55:03,280
I don't feel so well.

1995
01:55:07,120 --> 01:55:07,900
It's okay.

1996
01:55:07,980 --> 01:55:12,340
As long as the enemies are in front of me and I never look
behind me, we'll be fine.

1997
01:55:14,380 --> 01:55:17,060
Maria, the simulation is breaking.

1998
01:55:17,680 --> 01:55:19,380
Doki, we're going behind you.

1999
01:55:19,820 --> 01:55:20,640
Wait, no.

2000
01:55:21,220 --> 01:55:22,640
No, you're not supposed to.

2001
01:55:22,860 --> 01:55:23,940
I can't function.

2002
01:55:24,180 --> 01:55:25,660
She can't turn around now.

2003
01:55:25,740 --> 01:55:27,220
You have to go in front of her.

2004
01:55:29,240 --> 01:55:30,420
There's people in front of me.

2005
01:55:30,620 --> 01:55:31,400
Let's kill this team.

2006
01:55:31,860 --> 01:55:32,100
Easily.

2007
01:55:34,720 --> 01:55:35,680
Wait, where did he go?

2008
01:55:36,340 --> 01:55:36,860
Was it solo?

2009
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:39,420
Did I freak out over a solo?

2010
01:55:40,820 --> 01:55:42,420
I think I freaked out over a solo.

2011
01:55:43,360 --> 01:55:43,800
Oh.

2012
01:55:43,840 --> 01:55:45,520
Oh, yeah, that's a rat.

2013
01:55:47,560 --> 01:55:51,060
Okay, as long as I'm looking in this general direction,
we'll be fine.

2014
01:55:52,060 --> 01:55:52,280
Okay.

2015
01:55:52,700 --> 01:55:54,420
Yeah, my textures will be fine.

2016
01:55:55,280 --> 01:55:56,100
In front of me?

2017
01:56:00,520 --> 01:56:00,880
Oh, my God.

2018
01:56:00,980 --> 01:56:01,740
Look at him fucking.

2019
01:56:02,600 --> 01:56:03,400
Let's go.

2020
01:56:06,750 --> 01:56:07,250
He's flesh.

2021
01:56:07,310 --> 01:56:08,370
If you can kill him, do me.

2022
01:56:09,530 --> 01:56:12,310
You go kill him, Nico, and I are going to go kill this other
team.

2023
01:56:12,370 --> 01:56:12,990
He did what you did!

2024
01:56:13,150 --> 01:56:14,910
He made him right behind him!

2025
01:56:21,390 --> 01:56:31,670
distraction there's people on me wait what okay okay no

behind me here where i'm looking where i'm paying yeah i'm

2027
01:56:44,430 --> 01:56:48,450
going to the right because that's not because they have the
run from zone.

2028
01:56:48,610 --> 01:56:50,570
Oh, actually, they're going all the way bottom.

2029
01:56:52,170 --> 01:56:52,570
Wait, army?

2030
01:56:57,100 --> 01:56:58,060
It's a squad of three.

2031
01:56:59,700 --> 01:57:00,500
Oh, where does...

2032
01:57:00,500 --> 01:57:01,520
Whose squad is he from?

2033
01:57:01,640 --> 01:57:03,040
Oh, no, I can't look behind!

2034
01:57:05,340 --> 01:57:06,240
I thought you were all better.

2035
01:57:06,440 --> 01:57:06,840
What happened?

2036
01:57:06,860 --> 01:57:07,300
I don't know.

2037
01:57:07,400 --> 01:57:08,180
I got sick again.

2038
01:57:11,420 --> 01:57:12,800
That's how getting sick works.

2039
01:57:13,100 --> 01:57:14,920
You don't just magically get better overnight.

2040
01:57:19,460 --> 01:57:19,820
Alright.

2041
01:57:20,180 --> 01:57:21,000
Don't worry, I'm okay now.

2042
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:22,440
No!

2043
01:57:23,180 --> 01:57:23,840
No!

2044
01:57:24,080 --> 01:57:24,980
I'm dead.

2045
01:57:25,260 --> 01:57:25,540
No!

2046
01:57:25,960 --> 01:57:26,560
I'm dead!

2047
01:57:28,100 --> 01:57:31,300
2-1, 2-1, 2-1!

2048
01:57:32,980 --> 01:57:33,640
I'm dead!

2049
01:57:35,280 --> 01:57:36,920
I'm gonna reset your game.

2050
01:57:37,160 --> 01:57:38,460
Yeah, I'm gonna reset my game.

2051
01:57:40,800 --> 01:57:43,880
You know, not be able to look backwards was pretty rough.

2052
01:57:44,060 --> 01:57:45,100
Not gonna lie.

2053
01:57:45,700 --> 01:57:48,220
I'm gonna reset that shit real fast.

2054
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:49,760
That was...

2055
01:57:49,760 --> 01:57:51,180
That was a little awkward.

2056
01:57:52,060 --> 01:57:59,840
I could only look one way Alright, no, no Alright, we end
with another win Do you think we do it, Gumi?

2057
01:58:01,780 --> 01:58:01,960
Oh?

2058
01:58:02,260 --> 01:58:02,700
What'd you say?

2059
01:58:03,260 --> 01:58:04,360
We can get a win, right?

2060
01:58:05,300 --> 01:58:05,880
Yeah, for sure.

2061
01:58:06,460 --> 01:58:06,860
Yeah, right?

2062
01:58:07,540 --> 01:58:08,200
Check drivers?

2063
01:58:08,720 --> 01:58:09,220
No!

2064
01:58:10,200 --> 01:58:12,880
Because I'm too lazy to restart my PC.

2065
01:58:17,480 --> 01:58:19,520
Just wanna play video games.

2066
01:58:20,800 --> 01:58:39,040
I just wanna hang out and play video games or invite me yes
ma'am that's me oh we're rookie too come on we can win we

2067
01:58:39,040 --> 01:58:40,180
need to win

2068
01:58:43,740 --> 01:58:45,440
pike in roller

2069
01:58:53,290 --> 01:58:54,930
No way I just said that.

2070
01:58:55,010 --> 01:58:55,730
I agree, though.

2071
01:58:56,350 --> 01:59:00,190
Go ahead.

2072
01:59:02,540 --> 01:59:03,920
GPU is literally dying on stream.

2073
01:59:04,400 --> 01:59:05,380
Don't say that.

2074
01:59:05,640 --> 01:59:06,660
He's just shy.

2075
01:59:08,120 --> 01:59:10,380
My GPU has, like, performance anxiety.

2076
01:59:11,260 --> 01:59:12,260
Don't say that.

2077
01:59:12,720 --> 01:59:19,600
The more you judge my GPU, the more it's going to freeze.

2078
01:59:19,620 --> 01:59:20,620
Don't freak out.

2079
01:59:27,320 --> 01:59:29,880
Can't please get a new PC.

2080
01:59:39,120 --> 01:59:39,600
Yeah?

2081
01:59:41,540 --> 01:59:42,940
For Valentine's Day, can you fly?

2082
01:59:43,180 --> 01:59:44,240
Both of us to France.

2083
01:59:44,800 --> 01:59:46,180
And then we can get a quisson or something.

2084
01:59:46,340 --> 01:59:47,460
It's my dog's birthday.

2085
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:48,920
Why don't you fly over?

2086
01:59:49,060 --> 01:59:49,220
Yeah!

2087
01:59:50,460 --> 01:59:53,260
Why don't you fly over and celebrate my dog's birthday, huh?

2088
01:59:54,440 --> 01:59:55,600
You didn't bite me.

2089
01:59:56,040 --> 01:59:57,420
Wait, I'm biting you now.

2090
01:59:57,720 --> 01:59:58,200
Surprise!

2091
01:59:58,900 --> 01:59:59,380
That's...

2092
02:00:03,820 --> 02:00:05,580
Oh my god.

2093
02:00:06,440 --> 02:00:07,800
You ruined the surprise.

2094
02:00:08,320 --> 02:00:09,680
It wasn't going to be a surprise.

2095
02:00:10,500 --> 02:00:11,440
A surprise for who?

2096
02:00:11,580 --> 02:00:12,100
For me?

2097
02:00:13,040 --> 02:00:13,120
Yes.

2098
02:00:14,240 --> 02:00:14,340
Surprise.

2099
02:00:14,680 --> 02:00:15,400
You're invited.

2100
02:00:15,960 --> 02:00:16,860
You're invited.

2101
02:00:22,260 --> 02:00:23,800
You got this GPU.

2102
02:00:24,080 --> 02:00:25,520
Doki too, I suppose.

2103
02:00:28,500 --> 02:00:29,220
Alright.

2104
02:00:32,460 --> 02:00:34,040
Got an R E.

2105
02:00:35,560 --> 02:00:37,400
Wait, is there people here?

2106
02:00:38,080 --> 02:00:38,340
Yep.

2107
02:00:39,060 --> 02:00:41,000
Oh shit, I was not paying attention.

2108
02:00:42,980 --> 02:00:43,560
Where though?

2109
02:00:43,840 --> 02:00:44,540
Are you lying?

2110
02:00:45,580 --> 02:00:46,920
They're near me.

2111
02:00:47,200 --> 02:00:48,140
Are you lying?

2112
02:00:48,740 --> 02:00:50,840
They're literally near me.

2113
02:00:51,040 --> 02:00:51,280
No.

2114
02:00:52,600 --> 02:00:54,140
Okay, actually I believe now.

2115
02:00:54,860 --> 02:00:55,960
That guy might be dead.

2116
02:00:57,100 --> 02:00:57,720
I craft one?

2117
02:00:58,280 --> 02:00:59,440
I'm gonna help Nico.

2118
02:01:02,460 --> 02:01:04,200
Whoa, I'm crazy.

2119
02:01:04,560 --> 02:01:05,060
Whoa, Nico.

2120
02:01:05,540 --> 02:01:05,540
Nice.

2121
02:01:05,660 --> 02:01:05,800
Here.

2122
02:01:05,920 --> 02:01:06,620
Here's an armor swap.

2123
02:01:06,660 --> 02:01:08,160
Oh, there's blood, Doki!

2124
02:01:08,460 --> 02:01:08,920
No!

2125
02:01:09,960 --> 02:01:11,220
I'm coming over?

2126
02:01:11,520 --> 02:01:12,460
Oh, you're dead.

2127
02:01:13,020 --> 02:01:14,780
Oh, my stomach hurt.

2128
02:01:15,400 --> 02:01:16,040
Where are they?

2129
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:17,440
Um.

2130
02:01:17,880 --> 02:01:18,280
Inside?

2131
02:01:19,320 --> 02:01:19,660
Yeah.

2132
02:01:20,620 --> 02:01:22,520
I hear someone above me.

2133
02:01:23,720 --> 02:01:24,720
Oh, he saw me.

2134
02:01:26,020 --> 02:01:27,800
There's someone above me as well.

2135
02:01:28,160 --> 02:01:30,120
So, that's what I'm nervous about.

2136
02:01:31,460 --> 02:01:31,980
Oh.

2137
02:01:32,880 --> 02:01:34,460
My stomach hurt.

2138
02:01:36,660 --> 02:01:37,340
Whoa.

2139
02:01:40,440 --> 02:01:42,460
Guess I'll have to fucking...

2140
02:01:43,380 --> 02:01:44,240
Roll in.

2141
02:01:45,040 --> 02:01:45,600
Got you?

2142
02:01:46,300 --> 02:01:47,780
That's the person who killed me.

2143
02:01:48,820 --> 02:01:49,920
Where's his teammate, though?

2144
02:01:52,220 --> 02:01:52,900
Um...

2145
02:01:52,900 --> 02:01:53,660
I don't know.

2146
02:01:55,240 --> 02:01:56,700
I heard his teammate nearby.

2147
02:01:57,080 --> 02:01:57,700
Guess not.

2148
02:01:59,200 --> 02:02:02,440
It would be a shame if he just...

2149
02:02:02,440 --> 02:02:03,200
now.

2150
02:02:08,620 --> 02:02:09,120
What are you doing?

2151
02:02:10,320 --> 02:02:15,140
What is that?

2152
02:02:16,300 --> 02:02:16,760
What is what?

2153
02:02:17,140 --> 02:02:17,380
What is that?

2154
02:02:18,320 --> 02:02:18,660
What's what?

2155
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:19,340
What is that?

2156
02:02:19,980 --> 02:02:20,740
What is what?

2157
02:02:23,020 --> 02:02:24,280
What is what?

2158
02:02:27,100 --> 02:02:28,320
For free?

2159
02:02:28,700 --> 02:02:29,160
Damn.

2160
02:02:30,160 --> 02:02:35,500
I got a tiny bit of chippy.

2161
02:02:36,140 --> 02:02:36,480
Oh.

2162
02:02:38,060 --> 02:02:40,340
Dude, I've been recently drinking this drink.

2163
02:02:40,480 --> 02:02:42,860
It's kind of like Sodipop, but it's not Sodipop.

2164
02:02:43,280 --> 02:02:43,980
Where is it?

2165
02:02:44,640 --> 02:02:47,160
It has, like, apple cider vinegar inside of it.

2166
02:02:47,180 --> 02:02:48,200
And it's good for your stomach.

2167
02:02:48,980 --> 02:02:49,660
What's it called?

2168
02:02:51,540 --> 02:02:52,360
Not sponsored!

2169
02:02:52,600 --> 02:02:53,140
Not sponsored!

2170
02:02:57,720 --> 02:02:59,920
Okay, but what's it called?

2171
02:03:00,360 --> 02:03:01,400
It's called Poppy.

2172
02:03:01,960 --> 02:03:02,320
Poppy?

2173
02:03:03,180 --> 02:03:04,380
P-O-P-P-I.

2174
02:03:04,680 --> 02:03:07,780
It has apple cider vinegar, and it's really good for your
gut health.

2175
02:03:09,460 --> 02:03:10,340
Are you sure?

2176
02:03:10,680 --> 02:03:11,840
Are you sure you're not sponsored?

2177
02:03:12,980 --> 02:03:13,780
I'm sure.

2178
02:03:14,240 --> 02:03:15,660
I just really like it.

2179
02:03:16,520 --> 02:03:18,160
Oh shit, wait, what's in that package?

2180
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:20,420
I don't know, that sounds pretty terrible.

2181
02:03:22,820 --> 02:03:24,500
That sounds pretty fucking terrible.

2182
02:03:24,800 --> 02:03:25,620
Vinegar and what?

2183
02:03:26,400 --> 02:03:27,300
Apple cider vinegar?

2184
02:03:27,400 --> 02:03:28,120
You've never had that?

2185
02:03:28,300 --> 02:03:28,600
No.

2186
02:03:28,880 --> 02:03:31,000
I don't like cider in general, to be honest.

2187
02:03:32,140 --> 02:03:32,560
I don't like...

2188
02:03:32,560 --> 02:03:37,200
Okay, no, it's not cider, nor is it actually vinegar.

2189
02:03:37,340 --> 02:03:37,800
It's like...

2190
02:03:37,800 --> 02:03:38,000
Oh!

2191
02:03:38,060 --> 02:03:39,260
It doesn't taste like it.

2192
02:03:40,700 --> 02:03:41,480
Got winging.

2193
02:03:42,480 --> 02:03:42,660
Oh.

2194
02:03:44,060 --> 02:03:45,280
Wait, what does it taste like?

2195
02:03:45,880 --> 02:03:47,420
It just tastes like, um...

2196
02:03:47,420 --> 02:03:48,580
It just tastes like...

2197
02:03:48,580 --> 02:03:52,620
You know, those busy water drinks with a tiny bit of
flavored juice?

2198
02:03:52,720 --> 02:03:53,440
Sparkling water?

2199
02:03:54,360 --> 02:03:55,240
Yeah, except like...

2200
02:03:55,240 --> 02:03:57,720
But like, but like flavored sparkling water.

2201
02:03:57,920 --> 02:03:59,400
Yeah, yeah, exactly like that.

2202
02:03:59,680 --> 02:03:59,880
Exactly.

2203
02:04:00,100 --> 02:04:01,960

I'm fucking shooting them and he's on purpose like blocking

2216
02:04:54,140 --> 02:04:55,540
Standing in front of me.

2217
02:04:58,740 --> 02:04:59,780
That's my all.

2218
02:04:59,960 --> 02:05:00,920
Poppy and bio.

2219
02:05:01,100 --> 02:05:02,160
Poppy and bio.

2220
02:05:02,640 --> 02:05:06,320
Here, I smoked, but it was 100% not gonna help you.

2221
02:05:06,340 --> 02:05:07,780
This deflating for you or some shit.

2222
02:05:08,060 --> 02:05:09,520
There's zip bloody on your ass!

2223

2224
02:05:12,700 --> 02:05:13,820
That's fucking right, bitch.

2225
02:05:15,120 --> 02:05:15,960
What the fuck?

2226
02:05:16,600 --> 02:05:17,820
I cracked this guy, too?

2227
02:05:21,680 --> 02:05:22,640
Stupid clones.

2228
02:05:22,900 --> 02:05:23,160
Up here.

2229
02:05:25,200 --> 02:05:28,520
Yeah, there's two that zipped, but his other teammate
redeployed.

2230
02:05:30,540 --> 02:05:31,020
Uh...

2231
02:05:32,240 --> 02:05:33,820
I mean, we can...

2232
02:05:33,820 --> 02:05:35,720
Do we want to contest their high ground?

2233
02:05:35,860 --> 02:05:37,100
Because they're just chilling up there.

2234
02:05:37,140 --> 02:05:38,000
Nico's just looting.

2235
02:05:38,060 --> 02:05:40,260
I mean, to be fair, it's free loot.

2236
02:05:41,080 --> 02:05:41,760
Wait, what the fuck?

2237
02:05:42,040 --> 02:05:42,920
Is Mika fighting people?

2238
02:05:43,180 --> 02:05:43,940
No, it's them.

2239
02:05:44,240 --> 02:05:45,480
Fuses can, like...

2240
02:05:45,480 --> 02:05:48,660
The Fuse can, like, chuck names from afar.

2241
02:05:50,140 --> 02:05:51,680
Like, from 800 miles.

2242
02:05:52,400 --> 02:05:53,060
Dude, that's...

2243
02:05:54,880 --> 02:05:56,720
Yeah, that's called Fuse.

2244
02:05:58,440 --> 02:06:00,240
I'm not that old, man.

2245
02:06:00,740 --> 02:06:03,580
You don't have to talk to me like I'm 50 something.

2246
02:06:04,400 --> 02:06:04,940
Okay.

2247
02:06:05,300 --> 02:06:05,600
Okay.

2248
02:06:08,760 --> 02:06:09,520
They're running?

2249
02:06:10,260 --> 02:06:12,120
Oh shit, Nico's going in.

2250
02:06:14,440 --> 02:06:15,780
He's going in!

2251
02:06:17,400 --> 02:06:18,820
I just realized you're still white armor.

2252
02:06:20,480 --> 02:06:20,800
Yeah.

2253
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:22,040
Go help him!

2254
02:06:23,100 --> 02:06:23,900
Wait, where are they?

2255
02:06:24,540 --> 02:06:25,620
Oh, they're still over there.

2256
02:06:26,020 --> 02:06:27,000
Are they still running?

2257
02:06:27,500 --> 02:06:28,700
Fucking cowards!

2258
02:06:31,980 --> 02:06:33,380
Hey, they're fighting someone else!

2259
02:06:34,080 --> 02:06:35,400
Oh, they're going, they're going, they're going up!

2260
02:06:36,800 --> 02:06:37,580

I smoked again for you.

Thank you.

I'm going to take...

2274
02:07:50,020 --> 02:07:50,920
I'm going to drop down from here.

2275
02:07:50,980 --> 02:07:51,960
Another squad on him.

2276
02:07:52,800 --> 02:07:53,640
Oh, that's not good.

2277
02:07:54,880 --> 02:07:57,420
I am sliding into the other squad now.

2278
02:08:04,380 --> 02:08:04,900
Squadding.

2279
02:08:05,260 --> 02:08:05,780
I'm...

2280
02:08:05,780 --> 02:08:06,220
Oh, nice.

Got one?

02:08:13,130 --> 02:08:14,750
Wait, he has fucking Digi too.

2283
02:08:14,850 --> 02:08:15,450
That's illegal.

2284
02:08:18,210 --> 02:08:19,010
Oh my god.

2285
02:08:19,170 --> 02:08:19,970
A Dyson one?

2286
02:08:21,850 --> 02:08:23,010

2299
02:09:21,460 --> 02:09:23,420
I don't see him at all right now.

2300
02:09:24,760 --> 02:09:27,000
Oh, oh, he's all the way over there.

2301
02:09:30,640 --> 02:09:32,080
Well, I'm heading over them.

2302
02:09:33,100 --> 02:09:33,580
Hello.

2303
02:09:34,240 --> 02:09:35,480
Knock, knock.

2304
02:09:37,100 --> 02:09:38,460
Where are you?

2305
02:09:47,840 --> 02:09:48,400
Okay.

2306
02:09:49,420 --> 02:09:49,980
Alright.

2307
02:09:52,060 --> 02:09:54,220
He got stuck on the car.

2308
02:09:54,320 --> 02:09:55,860
Right here.

2309
02:09:58,160 --> 02:09:58,840
Okay.

2310
02:10:02,440 --> 02:10:06,140
That was a little embarrassing for that man.

2311
02:10:10,260 --> 02:10:10,260
Alright.

2312
02:10:10,700 --> 02:10:11,020
No, bro.

2313
02:10:11,360 --> 02:10:12,540
I'm just healing up right now.

2314
02:10:14,180 --> 02:10:16,100
I don't think that guy had his driver's license.

2315
02:10:19,020 --> 02:10:19,600
Bless you.

2316
02:10:20,020 --> 02:10:23,660
I hear people fighting, like, um, here.

2317
02:10:24,840 --> 02:10:27,080
Yeah, there's like another fight over there.

2318
02:10:27,380 --> 02:10:28,220
All right, you go help Nico.

2319
02:10:28,720 --> 02:10:31,080
I'm gonna slowly walk run over.

2320
02:10:32,100 --> 02:10:32,440
Yeah.

2321
02:10:34,200 --> 02:10:35,000
Poor guy.

2322
02:10:35,340 --> 02:10:37,040
Never got his driver's license.

2323
02:10:41,660 --> 02:10:42,820
I'm heading over.

2324
02:10:44,120 --> 02:10:45,320
There's another...

2325
02:10:45,320 --> 02:10:46,900
Oh, wait, that's a replicator over here.

2326
02:10:47,220 --> 02:10:47,500
Nice.

2327
02:10:49,340 --> 02:10:50,420
I'm almost there.

2328
02:10:50,740 --> 02:10:51,300
You're knocked?

2329
02:10:51,560 --> 02:10:51,780
You're knocked?

2330
02:10:52,660 --> 02:10:53,620
Don't worry.

2331
02:10:54,280 --> 02:10:55,060
Don't worry, I'm coming.

2332
02:10:56,080 --> 02:10:56,440
Nico!

2333
02:10:57,280 --> 02:10:57,300
Nico!

2334
02:11:00,040 --> 02:11:01,820
I need help.

2335
02:11:02,760 --> 02:11:03,540
Oh, no!

2336
02:11:04,400 --> 02:11:04,740
No!

2337
02:11:05,500 --> 02:11:06,820
There's another guy!

2338
02:11:06,880 --> 02:11:08,220
There's two!

2339
02:11:09,880 --> 02:11:11,900
There's another team, there's another team right here.

2340
02:11:12,400 --> 02:11:14,440
Don't let him thirst me, I swear to God!

2341
02:11:16,280 --> 02:11:17,800
Don't let him thirst me!

2342
02:11:18,160 --> 02:11:19,460
I have a wingman!

2343
02:11:19,720 --> 02:11:21,620
If they thirst me, they take the wingman!

2344
02:11:22,700 --> 02:11:24,040
I just need you guys to know that!

2345
02:11:27,140 --> 02:11:29,900
They cannot, they absolutely cannot thirst me.

2346
02:11:30,580 --> 02:11:33,040
They absolutely cannot thirst me!

2347
02:11:36,690 --> 02:11:38,430
I got them pretty low!

2348
02:11:46,550 --> 02:11:49,190
That was a little scary.

2349
02:11:51,230 --> 02:11:52,090
Wait, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

2350
02:11:52,090 --> 02:11:52,410
I'm safe!

2351
02:11:52,510 --> 02:11:53,230
I'm so safe!

2352
02:11:54,150 --> 02:11:55,270
There's no way!

2353
02:11:56,070 --> 02:11:57,490
Yeah, there's no way!

2354
02:11:58,810 --> 02:12:00,330

2359
02:12:37,560 --> 02:12:37,620
I don't think you're shooting at you.

2360
02:12:38,180 --> 02:12:39,320
Yeah, Sam.

2361
02:12:39,920 --> 02:12:40,240

02:12:41,080 --> 02:12:42,120
Oh, behind me!

2363

Behind me!

2364
02:12:42,800 --> 02:12:44,040
I think we gotta back up.

2365
02:12:45,120 --> 02:12:46,700
I'm gonna back up fully.

2366
02:12:50,330 --> 02:12:52,330
There's too many people on us.

2367
02:12:54,790 --> 02:12:55,310
I'm good?

2368
02:12:56,710 --> 02:12:57,350
Wait.

2369
02:12:57,790 --> 02:12:58,590
I think I see more.

2370
02:12:59,170 --> 02:12:59,570
Wait.

2371
02:13:00,010 --> 02:13:00,830
That's not good.

2372
02:13:01,850 --> 02:13:02,170
Where?

2373
02:13:06,380 --> 02:13:07,020
Where?

2374
02:13:07,020 --> 02:13:07,380
I don't know.

2375
02:13:07,460 --> 02:13:08,100
Marge.

2376
02:13:09,040 --> 02:13:10,960
Maybe he can miss...

2377
02:13:11,660 --> 02:13:13,060
I swear I lied.

2378
02:13:13,540 --> 02:13:14,260
100%.

2379
02:13:15,100 --> 02:13:15,820
Okay.

2380
02:13:16,380 --> 02:13:17,440
Well, it has to be rat, right?

2381
02:13:17,960 --> 02:13:19,740
But men lie all the time, so...

2382
02:13:19,740 --> 02:13:20,140
Oh!

2383
02:13:21,920 --> 02:13:23,560
Who hurt you?

2384
02:13:23,960 --> 02:13:25,120
Who hurt you?

2385
02:13:26,260 --> 02:13:29,160
Oh my god, what a statement.

2386
02:13:30,160 --> 02:13:34,340
Oh my god.

2387
02:13:39,940 --> 02:13:41,180
They landed up there.

2388
02:13:42,540 --> 02:13:43,020
I see them.

2389
02:13:43,160 --> 02:13:43,940
They're right in front of me.

2390
02:13:45,700 --> 02:13:46,000
I'm looking.

2391
02:13:46,120 --> 02:13:47,960
I'm trying to make sure we don't...

2392
02:13:47,960 --> 02:13:53,200
I'm trying to make sure we don't get, like, uh, stealth
done.

2393
02:13:55,040 --> 02:13:56,460
I'm just looking behind us.

2394
02:13:56,780 --> 02:13:57,760
See if there's any rats.

2395
02:14:00,720 --> 02:14:01,200
Oh, yeah.

2396
02:14:01,360 --> 02:14:02,040
I see a rat.

2397
02:14:03,120 --> 02:14:04,520
It's gonna come all the way over to us?

2398
02:14:08,510 --> 02:14:10,850
I guess he's gonna take the zip on the other side.

2399
02:14:11,290 --> 02:14:24,410

2401
02:14:42,340 --> 02:14:45,700
There's just like, there's like one rat in former squads.

2402
02:14:49,560 --> 02:14:51,140
I don't really have an angle on this.

2403
02:14:53,320 --> 02:14:55,020
Oh, they're shooting, they're trying to kill the rat.

2404
02:14:55,160 --> 02:14:55,860
They killed the rat.

2405
02:14:59,100 --> 02:15:00,600
Oh, rat is dead.

2406
02:15:02,220 --> 02:15:02,780
Red armor?

2407
02:15:05,440 --> 02:15:06,320
Jesus Christ.

2408
02:15:07,020 --> 02:15:07,720
Speak again, idiot.

2409
02:15:09,220 --> 02:15:10,580
That's a lot of people.

2410
02:15:12,740 --> 02:15:14,520
Where do you guys have medkits?

2411
02:15:15,580 --> 02:15:16,600
I am one.

2412
02:15:17,200 --> 02:15:18,400
And I have a couple syringes.

2413
02:15:18,500 --> 02:15:19,180
Yeah, I need some.

2414
02:15:19,300 --> 02:15:19,860
I'm on my way.

2415
02:15:22,780 --> 02:15:23,100
Nice.

2416
02:15:23,400 --> 02:15:24,100
Here you go.

2417
02:15:24,220 --> 02:15:24,860
Come on me.

2418
02:15:29,120 --> 02:15:29,920
Alright, so...

2419
02:15:29,920 --> 02:15:30,460
Wait, where is Zone?

2420
02:15:32,100 --> 02:15:33,700
No, they're like right below us.

2421
02:15:33,780 --> 02:15:34,740
They're like right below.

2422
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:39,960
There's a whole squad.

2423
02:15:40,520 --> 02:15:41,600
A whole squad below us.

2424
02:15:42,240 --> 02:15:42,540
Hoop!

2425
02:15:44,740 --> 02:15:45,780
Oh my god, please.

2426
02:15:45,800 --> 02:15:47,600
Please, I don't have figments.

2427
02:15:48,040 --> 02:15:48,360
Chill.

2428
02:15:49,280 --> 02:15:50,460
I can drop you a bat right here.

2429
02:15:50,600 --> 02:15:52,760
Alright, I'll take that after my shield cells.

2430
02:15:59,680 --> 02:16:00,020
Oh, five.

2431
02:16:00,020 --> 02:16:02,500
I can just keep my Nika, because he has that box.

2432
02:16:02,500 --> 02:16:04,040
Yeah, I can just keep this cross.

2433
02:16:04,120 --> 02:16:06,260
You go Nika, and I'm just going to keep this cross.

2434
02:16:07,460 --> 02:16:08,140
They're right here.

2435
02:16:09,640 --> 02:16:11,220
I wonder if I can nade this.

2436
02:16:11,440 --> 02:16:13,180
Or not nade, but alt this.

2437
02:16:14,040 --> 02:16:14,400
This.

2438
02:16:15,880 --> 02:16:17,140
That should hit them, right?

2439
02:16:20,960 --> 02:16:22,260
Should make sure they don't climb up.

2440
02:16:23,180 --> 02:16:24,660
Oh, hey, I hit one.

2441
02:16:25,740 --> 02:16:26,740
Those are the team right here stuck.

2442
02:16:27,900 --> 02:16:28,540
I knocked one.

2443
02:16:29,980 --> 02:16:30,700
Knocked on.

2444
02:16:30,840 --> 02:16:31,900
Got it behind this thing.

2445
02:16:32,820 --> 02:16:33,540
Come on.

2446
02:16:34,540 --> 02:16:36,480
He has to come over.

2447
02:16:37,740 --> 02:16:38,040
Nice.

2448
02:16:38,260 --> 02:16:38,560
My dad.

2449
02:16:39,440 --> 02:16:43,080
Are you still in there?

2450
02:16:44,040 --> 02:16:44,540
Oh, yes.

2451
02:16:47,540 --> 02:16:49,500
I'm on my way, baby girl!

2452
02:16:50,260 --> 02:16:50,820
Whoa!

2453
02:16:52,280 --> 02:16:54,380
Wait, there's a full team over here too!

2454
02:16:54,420 --> 02:16:56,200
Oh my god, it's like a pack of rats!

2455
02:16:56,860 --> 02:16:57,580
Oh my god.

2456
02:16:58,700 --> 02:16:59,140
Nice.

2457
02:17:00,120 --> 02:17:02,120
I'm trying to make sure they don't climb up on us.

2458
02:17:02,680 --> 02:17:04,740
Go, Nico, go!

2459
02:17:07,220 --> 02:17:07,660
Whoa.

2460
02:17:09,220 --> 02:17:10,240
Wait, are you guys okay?

2461
02:17:10,700 --> 02:17:11,340
On us, on us.

2462
02:17:11,840 --> 02:17:12,720
I'm coming over.

2463
02:17:13,580 --> 02:17:15,460
Oh shit, other teams coming over.

2464
02:17:16,160 --> 02:17:17,540
Do you have armor swaps here?

2465
02:17:18,240 --> 02:17:18,640
There, there.

2466
02:17:19,820 --> 02:17:20,520
Nice, okay.

2467
02:17:23,780 --> 02:17:25,280
Nice, that's the core I need it.

2468
02:17:29,480 --> 02:17:30,800
Don't worry, I have Digi.

2469
02:17:30,940 --> 02:17:32,260
Wait, there's still one more.

2470
02:17:33,080 --> 02:17:34,420
Where the fuck is the last one?

2471
02:17:36,920 --> 02:17:37,940
Where do I have purple?

2472
02:17:39,500 --> 02:17:40,120
Do I have Nades?

2473
02:17:42,480 --> 02:17:43,940
Oh, I thought that was gonna be closer.

2474
02:17:49,290 --> 02:17:51,030
Can I lift those bodies real quick?

2475
02:17:51,290 --> 02:17:52,530
I'm going up behind ground.

2476
02:17:54,090 --> 02:17:55,570
I might be dead doing this.

2477
02:17:56,410 --> 02:17:56,690
On me?

2478
02:17:58,590 --> 02:18:00,590
Holy shit, what is your strength?

2479
02:18:03,030 --> 02:18:04,950
Oh, he's won, he's won, right here.

2480
02:18:05,650 --> 02:18:06,190
This guy's won.

2481
02:18:06,390 --> 02:18:06,630
Yeah!

2482
02:18:09,410 --> 02:18:09,870
What's...

2483
02:18:09,870 --> 02:18:10,670
Oh, Nico's got this.

2484
02:18:10,750 --> 02:18:11,410
He can 1v3!

2485
02:18:12,010 --> 02:18:12,610
He can 1v3!

2486
02:18:12,790 --> 02:18:13,390
Believe in Nico!

2487
02:18:14,590 --> 02:18:15,470
Cluture carry!

2488
02:18:17,430 --> 02:18:18,170
Cluture carry!

2489
02:18:20,610 --> 02:18:21,070
Yeah!

2490
02:18:23,130 --> 02:18:24,130
He did it!

2491
02:18:24,130 --> 02:18:24,270
Cluture carry!

2492
02:18:25,070 --> 02:18:25,530
Yeah!

2493
02:18:28,830 --> 02:18:30,410
Let him go.

2494
02:18:30,950 --> 02:18:32,330
I knew he got this.

2495
02:18:32,890 --> 02:18:33,930
I knew it.

2496
02:18:34,130 --> 02:18:36,010
I knew Nico's got this.

2497
02:18:36,090 --> 02:18:37,490
This is a Nico cam.

2498
02:18:39,030 --> 02:18:39,490
What the?

2499
02:18:41,190 --> 02:18:43,690
After all the meds and reses I gave you.

2500
02:18:45,050 --> 02:18:47,010
Yeah, but like...

2501
02:18:47,010 --> 02:18:48,590
But did you kill the last person?

2502
02:18:49,430 --> 02:18:50,410
I did, actually.

2503
02:18:50,990 --> 02:18:52,510
Wait, did you?

2504
02:18:52,750 --> 02:18:54,730
I did, like, 20 damage damage.

2505
02:18:56,130 --> 02:18:56,610
Nice.

2506
02:18:56,610 --> 02:18:58,290
I did 20 damage to him and I killed him.

2507
02:18:58,530 --> 02:19:01,170
Holy shit, we got 667 for that.

2508
02:19:01,410 --> 02:19:03,290
Why do you keep swapping the genius?

2509
02:19:03,410 --> 02:19:03,510
It's a bug.

2510
02:19:04,590 --> 02:19:11,590
It's a fucking apex bug that's been in there for like
fucking years now.

2511
02:19:13,590 --> 02:19:14,250
All right.

2512
02:19:15,310 --> 02:19:15,910
Look at that.

2513
02:19:16,370 --> 02:19:17,330
Look at us, girl.

2514
02:19:19,110 --> 02:19:20,530
I knew we could do it.

2515
02:19:20,970 --> 02:19:22,990
I knew Nico could do it.

2516
02:19:27,240 --> 02:19:39,000

Sorry, when did it happen?

02:20:09,090 --> 02:20:10,860
It was 9 p.m.

2521
02:20:10,980 --> 02:20:11,400
Ballerant?

2522
02:20:12,340 --> 02:20:14,500
Okay, but it's also my dog's birthday.

2523
02:20:15,380 --> 02:20:16,260
Okay, how about tonight?

2524
02:20:16,460 --> 02:20:17,360
I have to hear nappy-wappy.

2525
02:20:20,360 --> 02:20:20,660
Hey!

2526
02:20:21,240 --> 02:20:21,780
Hey!

2527
02:20:22,340 --> 02:20:22,720
Hey!

2528
02:20:27,840 --> 02:20:29,440
Alright, LG for me.

2529
02:20:31,980 --> 02:20:33,680
Where are you going?

2530
02:20:34,060 --> 02:20:34,900
LG for me.

2531
02:20:35,100 --> 02:20:36,020
I'm gonna sleep.

2532
02:20:36,420 --> 02:20:37,480
What do you mean?

2533
02:20:39,660 --> 02:20:40,580
Without me?

2534
02:20:41,240 --> 02:20:41,940
Oh my god.

2535
02:20:42,120 --> 02:20:43,100
Look what you did.

2536
02:20:43,180 --> 02:20:44,060
My game crashed.

2537
02:20:44,740 --> 02:20:49,400
That was a sign.

2538
02:20:50,080 --> 02:20:51,680
That was a sign.

2539
02:20:53,240 --> 02:20:53,740
Without me.

2540
02:20:54,820 --> 02:20:55,740
Look what you did.

2541
02:20:56,380 --> 02:20:57,860
My game fucking crashed.

2542
02:20:58,180 --> 02:21:00,560
Do you know it's the worst part?

2543
02:21:00,560 --> 02:21:01,180
You're the jump back.

2544
02:21:01,200 --> 02:21:03,600
Oh, wait, that's pretty bad.

2545
02:21:04,280 --> 02:21:07,140
Wait, usually it gives the jump master somebody else if it
crashes.

2546
02:21:09,140 --> 02:21:10,540
Did you pass it to me?

2547
02:21:11,040 --> 02:21:12,560
Did you pass it to me, Gully?

2548
02:21:12,760 --> 02:21:13,680
No, I didn't.

2549
02:21:13,720 --> 02:21:14,900
Did you pass it to me?

2550
02:21:14,920 --> 02:21:16,320
Mine automatically passes to Nico.

2551
02:21:16,820 --> 02:21:17,260
Did Nico?

2552
02:21:17,460 --> 02:21:18,300
Okay, good.

2553
02:21:18,560 --> 02:21:20,060
We blame it on Nico again.

2554
02:21:20,160 --> 02:21:21,540
There's actually enemies here.

2555
02:21:22,260 --> 02:21:22,840
Wait, what?

2556
02:21:23,760 --> 02:21:24,580
There's people here.

2557
02:21:24,660 --> 02:21:25,140
Wait, what?

2558
02:21:25,380 --> 02:21:25,960
I just...

2559
02:21:25,960 --> 02:21:26,500
Wait, what?

2560
02:21:26,720 --> 02:21:27,680
Wait, what?

2561
02:21:27,800 --> 02:21:28,560
I literally...

2562
02:21:28,560 --> 02:21:28,900
Okay.

2563
02:21:29,840 --> 02:21:30,960
I just got back.

2564
02:21:31,720 --> 02:21:32,520
Okay, cool.

2565
02:21:32,660 --> 02:21:34,780
Because I landed you in a semi-alright place.

2566
02:21:35,240 --> 02:21:35,920
I don't have a gun.

2567
02:21:36,660 --> 02:21:37,180
I have an A.

2568
02:21:40,220 --> 02:21:40,580
Oh!

2569
02:21:42,660 --> 02:21:44,460
I got all the attachments.

2570
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:45,660
Shut up!

2571
02:21:45,740 --> 02:21:46,460
Shut up, Doki!

2572
02:21:46,560 --> 02:21:47,560
Don't talk to me right now!

2573
02:21:49,540 --> 02:21:50,280
There's no gun.

2574
02:21:50,400 --> 02:21:51,260
I have a Mozab.

2575
02:21:53,200 --> 02:21:53,740
It's okay.

2576
02:21:53,880 --> 02:21:56,060
I kicked the bins.

2577
02:22:00,140 --> 02:22:00,640
Okay, sir.

2578
02:22:00,740 --> 02:22:01,640
Okay, you guys looted that.

02:22:02,700 --> 02:22:03,020

Okay.

2588
02:23:13,960 --> 02:23:15,400
I can't believe it.

2589
02:23:15,800 --> 02:23:16,780
Ready up, Nico!

2590
02:23:17,980 --> 02:23:19,180
Ready up!

2591
02:23:22,680 --> 02:23:24,260
Where the fuck is he?

2592
02:23:26,040 --> 02:23:27,200
Where did he go?

2593
02:23:31,600 --> 02:23:33,220
Where the fuck did Nico go?

2594
02:23:33,880 --> 02:23:38,840
All men do is eat hot chip, charge their phone, lie, and
abandon us.

2595
02:23:39,620 --> 02:23:40,760
Are you okay?

2596
02:23:41,040 --> 02:23:42,340
Are you okay?

2597
02:23:42,660 --> 02:23:43,720
No.

2598
02:23:44,060 --> 02:23:44,960
Who hurt you?

2599
02:23:46,340 --> 02:23:47,420
Who hurt you?

2600
02:23:47,520 --> 02:23:48,020
Oh, true.

2601
02:23:48,360 --> 02:23:48,740
You know my past.

2602
02:23:48,940 --> 02:23:49,720
You know my past.

2603
02:23:51,880 --> 02:23:54,800
I should say which one.

2604
02:23:59,760 --> 02:24:00,520
Sorry,

2605
02:24:03,800 --> 02:24:06,000
they all sort of blurred together.

2606
02:24:07,100 --> 02:24:09,380
They're all the same person.

2607
02:24:12,660 --> 02:24:13,580
He can't do it.

2608
02:24:14,220 --> 02:24:15,700
I will use a crutch right now.

2609
02:24:20,220 --> 02:24:21,760
He's getting water?

2610
02:24:22,520 --> 02:24:22,960
Fucking weak.

2611
02:24:23,500 --> 02:24:25,040
It's all about being dehydrated.

2612
02:24:25,180 --> 02:24:27,380
Okay, don't get dehydrated, guys, when you're gaming.

2613
02:24:27,440 --> 02:24:29,880
All of my dreams I spent.

2614
02:24:31,440 --> 02:24:34,920
Or if you need to get this girl a hug or to a cat cafe.

2615
02:24:35,460 --> 02:24:37,960
She literally has, like, her dog with her.

2616
02:24:38,780 --> 02:24:40,140
You can't save her.

2617
02:24:42,920 --> 02:24:44,060
Save me white girl.

2618
02:24:44,360 --> 02:24:44,660

02:24:47,100 --> 02:24:47,360
Save me.

2621
02:24:47,360 --> 02:24:48,760
Have you seen that photo on Mercy?

2622
02:24:49,200 --> 02:24:49,740
Which one?

2623
02:24:49,940 --> 02:24:50,180
Overlock?

2624
02:24:50,480 --> 02:24:51,200
There's so many.

2625
02:24:51,660 --> 02:24:54,400
Save me.

2626
02:24:54,540 --> 02:24:54,980
White girl.

2627
02:24:55,180 --> 02:24:56,420
Save me.

2628
02:24:56,420 --> 02:24:57,440

I swear I think it's the jump master.

2632
02:25:11,600 --> 02:25:12,400

I'm okay.

2637
02:25:44,220 --> 02:25:45,300
We have people on us.

2638
02:25:46,420 --> 02:25:47,180
Yay, Kazu.

2639
02:25:48,500 --> 02:25:49,960
Dude, what's your dog doing?

2640
02:25:50,960 --> 02:25:52,720
He's putting his head on my lap.

2641
02:25:52,800 --> 02:25:54,080
Are you just looking at me?

2642
02:25:54,780 --> 02:25:56,180
How am I a multi-billionaire?

2643
02:25:56,300 --> 02:25:57,680
I lost my job!

2644
02:26:02,920 --> 02:26:05,500
Yucky, can you name on my first class ticket to Japan,
please?

2645
02:26:05,800 --> 02:26:08,560
I heard you're a multi-billionaire.

2646
02:26:09,240 --> 02:26:10,220

Nico, you're pissing me off.

2676
02:27:35,480 --> 02:27:36,560
Why did I get a bat?

2677
02:27:36,620 --> 02:27:37,600
I could have gotten barricaded.

2678
02:27:41,300 --> 02:27:42,800
I'm going back to high ground.

2679
02:27:42,940 --> 02:27:44,080

Can't believe it, Gumi.

2687
02:28:12,300 --> 02:28:13,640
How dare you?

2688
02:28:15,800 --> 02:28:18,380
What has he done for me?

2689
02:28:20,080 --> 02:28:20,800
You're right.

2690
02:28:20,980 --> 02:28:22,420
What has Nico...

2691
02:28:22,420 --> 02:28:23,480
You're right, guys.

2692
02:28:23,740 --> 02:28:25,760
What has Nico done for us?

2693
02:28:26,180 --> 02:28:29,840

2694
02:28:33,130 --> 02:28:34,230

2695
02:28:35,150 --> 02:28:36,930
Wait, but he did help us win last game.

2696
02:28:41,090 --> 02:28:43,290
Are you in denial?

2697
02:28:45,650 --> 02:28:47,990
I literally got the last kill.

2698
02:28:49,550 --> 02:28:51,370
Yeah, like five damage.

2699
02:28:52,590 --> 02:28:52,830

2700
02:28:53,590 --> 02:28:54,290
Yeah, do you have proof?

2701
02:28:54,710 --> 02:28:55,890
You were down, you were down.

2702
02:28:56,150 --> 02:28:56,610
You have proof?

2703
02:28:56,790 --> 02:28:57,310
You can't say nothing.

2704
02:28:57,910 --> 02:29:03,510
Yeah, I have Shadow Play on- Yeah, I have Shadow Play on-
Yeah, I have Shadow Play on- Yeah, just give me a second.

02:29:03,610 --> 02:29:05,050
Yeah, do it, do it right now.

2706
02:29:05,930 --> 02:29:07,950
Um, I'm literally busy, I'm playing Apex.

2707
02:29:08,430 --> 02:29:09,230
Yeah, do it right now.

2708
02:29:09,350 --> 02:29:11,330
You can literally, we literally have no one here.

2709
02:29:11,810 --> 02:29:13,710
I said I'm literally playing Apex, don't talk to me.

2710
02:29:14,010 --> 02:29:15,130
We literally have no one here.

2711
02:29:15,850 --> 02:29:17,610
I can't pause this game.

2712
02:29:17,710 --> 02:29:18,990
What don't you understand?

2713
02:29:19,270 --> 02:29:19,990
Yes, you can.

2714
02:29:20,450 --> 02:29:20,910
Yes, you can.

2715
02:29:20,970 --> 02:29:21,950
We just stand still.

2716
02:29:25,750 --> 02:29:27,090
Goomy in denial.

2717
02:29:33,010 --> 02:29:34,930
I'm, uh, what are we playing Apex?

2718
02:29:36,110 --> 02:29:37,590
We're all literally playing Apex.

2719
02:29:37,770 --> 02:29:38,450
What do you mean?

2720
02:29:39,350 --> 02:29:41,270
I'm, what are we gaming right now?

2721
02:29:42,850 --> 02:29:43,850
Where are the people?

2722
02:29:44,090 --> 02:29:46,270
Where are the people that's running at us right now?

2723
02:29:47,450 --> 02:29:48,410
I could have scanned.

2724
02:29:49,290 --> 02:29:52,050
I mean, we could scan here.

2725
02:29:52,810 --> 02:29:53,410
Is there anyone here?

2726
02:29:53,550 --> 02:29:54,610
Oh, wait, no, there's no map.

2727
02:29:54,850 --> 02:29:56,130
There's only map room scans.

2728
02:29:56,830 --> 02:29:56,910
No?

2729
02:29:57,210 --> 02:29:58,150
There's a scan right there.

2730
02:29:59,470 --> 02:30:00,150
You're right.

2731
02:30:00,230 --> 02:30:01,010
It's an online game.

2732
02:30:01,130 --> 02:30:01,910
We can never pause.

2733
02:30:03,230 --> 02:30:04,290
People were here, though.

2734
02:30:04,990 --> 02:30:09,070
I remember when my mom used to yell at me to pause my game
while I was playing MapleStory.

2735
02:30:10,850 --> 02:30:11,730
Ah, classic.

2736
02:30:12,550 --> 02:30:13,430
Classic moms.

2737
02:30:14,510 --> 02:30:15,190
Don't you know?

2738
02:30:15,810 --> 02:30:17,730
I'm in this guild party quest.

2739
02:30:19,530 --> 02:30:20,010
Ooh!

2740
02:30:20,810 --> 02:30:21,290
And...

2741
02:30:21,290 --> 02:30:22,930
Wait, there's like people to our right.

2742
02:30:27,010 --> 02:30:28,210
Clearly to our right.

2743
02:30:31,500 --> 02:30:32,620
They're like shooting at each other.

2744
02:30:33,360 --> 02:30:35,920
Why did I see someone in your chat asking if my mom was
single?

2745
02:30:38,580 --> 02:30:39,060
Army?

2746
02:30:43,570 --> 02:30:44,050
Track?

2747
02:30:44,430 --> 02:30:45,110
32 flesh?

2748
02:30:45,390 --> 02:30:45,830
Right here?

2749
02:30:47,910 --> 02:30:49,470
Oh my gosh, champion's dead.

2750
02:30:49,850 --> 02:30:50,410
Am I right?

2751
02:30:50,470 --> 02:30:50,730
He's scared.

2752
02:30:50,790 --> 02:30:51,110
He's scared.

2753
02:30:51,170 --> 02:30:51,550
Jump over.

2754
02:30:53,090 --> 02:30:54,050
Trust me.

2755
02:30:54,370 --> 02:30:54,890
Jump over here.

2756
02:30:56,310 --> 02:30:57,110
Oh shit.

2757
02:30:57,670 --> 02:30:58,130
Oh, fuck.

2758
02:30:58,290 --> 02:30:59,230
Okay, that was my bad.

2759
02:30:59,350 --> 02:31:00,630
I should not have told you to jump over.

2760
02:31:04,400 --> 02:31:06,880
That was... Wait, that's another team!

2761
02:31:08,420 --> 02:31:10,560
That's another team, that's another team.

2762
02:31:10,900 --> 02:31:11,140
Woo!

2763
02:31:16,310 --> 02:31:18,050
Oh, Nico, no, don't you go, don't die!

2764
02:31:22,010 --> 02:31:23,070
Oh, fuck, okay.

2765
02:31:24,310 --> 02:31:24,610
All right.

2766
02:31:25,370 --> 02:31:26,250
This is awkward.

2767
02:31:35,110 --> 02:31:36,210
Oh, this is awkward.

2768
02:31:36,230 --> 02:31:36,550
awkward.

2769
02:31:38,030 --> 02:31:41,290
Wait, he... Oh my god, I have to reload.

2770
02:31:41,470 --> 02:31:41,770
Fuck.

2771
02:31:42,650 --> 02:31:43,470
I didn't even realize.

2772
02:31:44,590 --> 02:31:45,030
Woohoohoo!

2773
02:31:47,650 --> 02:31:49,230
Wait, that's part of his team?

2774
02:31:49,350 --> 02:31:50,330
I thought it was a third.

2775
02:31:50,710 --> 02:31:51,330
Third party.

2776
02:31:56,460 --> 02:31:58,260
This is a little awkward, guys.

2777
02:32:01,640 --> 02:32:02,480
You know what?

2778
02:32:02,500 --> 02:32:03,400
I can leave, right?

2779
02:32:18,820 --> 02:32:19,500
Oh, fuck.

2780
02:32:19,740 --> 02:32:22,320
No, his team, they came behind me!

2781
02:32:22,600 --> 02:32:23,520
No!

2782
02:32:23,520 --> 02:32:24,800
That was a terrible LT.

2783
02:32:25,160 --> 02:32:25,880
But not me.

2784
02:32:26,200 --> 02:32:26,860
L was a terrible.

2785
02:32:26,880 --> 02:32:27,300
You know what?

2786
02:32:27,320 --> 02:32:28,780
We'll do another good one.

2787
02:32:33,160 --> 02:32:36,600
JK, this is LG.

2788
02:32:39,520 --> 02:32:42,040

2789
02:32:43,060 --> 02:32:45,360
Whoa, calm down, Nico.

2790
02:32:46,600 --> 02:32:47,720

Oh my god.

2806
02:34:35,340 --> 02:34:37,220
What happened to you?

2807
02:34:37,920 --> 02:34:38,740
What happened to you?

2808
02:34:38,740 --> 02:34:40,380
You've changed, Gumi.

2809
02:34:40,820 --> 02:34:41,980
You've changed.

2810
02:34:42,540 --> 02:34:43,260
I'm gonna do it.

2811
02:34:43,620 --> 02:34:44,460
I'm going to do it.

2812
02:34:45,760 --> 02:34:46,600
Oh no!

2813
02:34:47,300 --> 02:34:48,740
You're on the list.

2814
02:34:50,100 --> 02:34:51,280
I'm gonna do it.

2815
02:34:51,420 --> 02:34:52,140
I'm doing it now.

2816
02:34:52,520 --> 02:34:53,040
Oh!

2817
02:34:56,720 --> 02:34:58,720
If he does it, we leave the game.

2818
02:34:59,520 --> 02:35:00,460
You do it, we leave.

2819
02:35:01,020 --> 02:35:02,660
Oh, there we go.

02:35:03,560 --> 02:35:04,600
Yeah, that's what we thought.

2821
02:35:04,640 --> 02:35:05,720
That's what we thought.

2822
02:35:11,720 --> 02:35:12,800
Oh my god.

I played League of Legends.

2826
02:35:18,280 --> 02:35:20,280
Oh, I'm sorry.

2827
02:35:21,080 --> 02:35:22,940
I play League of Legends every day.

2828
02:35:24,740 --> 02:35:25,620
And Valorant?

2829
02:35:28,580 --> 02:35:29,060
That's...

2830
02:35:29,060 --> 02:35:30,900
Are you okay, like, mentally?

2831
02:35:40,460 --> 02:35:40,940
That's...

2832
02:35:40,940 --> 02:35:44,160
I am surprised you do two of them at the same time.

2833
02:35:44,540 --> 02:35:44,980
In front of us!

2834
02:35:45,340 --> 02:35:45,860
Oh, go!

2835
02:35:46,980 --> 02:35:47,520
I got you?

2836
02:35:48,740 --> 02:35:50,600
I cracked one of them.

2837
02:35:52,460 --> 02:35:53,440
I cracked the other?

2838
02:35:55,420 --> 02:35:56,120
Cracked one?

2839
02:35:56,680 --> 02:35:57,340
Yeah, that's right.

2840
02:35:57,520 --> 02:35:58,180
Run, bitch.

2841
02:35:59,060 --> 02:35:59,380
Yeah.

2842
02:36:01,280 --> 02:36:02,140
Yeah, wait.

2843
02:36:02,240 --> 02:36:03,500
They're pulling up in the whippy.

2844
02:36:03,740 --> 02:36:04,580
Wait, I think that's another...

2845
02:36:06,340 --> 02:36:07,000
Not the one?

2846
02:36:07,260 --> 02:36:08,140
Wait, is that the same?

2847
02:36:08,400 --> 02:36:09,240
Okay, yeah, he is.

2848
02:36:10,400 --> 02:36:11,620
I hear someone to my right.

2849
02:36:13,000 --> 02:36:13,760
Yeah, here.

2850
02:36:18,060 --> 02:36:18,680
Oh, nice.

2851
02:36:18,760 --> 02:36:19,320
Nico got it.

2852
02:36:19,360 --> 02:36:19,700
Nice.

2853
02:36:19,700 --> 02:36:20,680
We all got it.

2854
02:36:21,780 --> 02:36:22,580
Yeah, Diane.

2855
02:36:23,620 --> 02:36:24,200
Be better.

2856
02:36:24,380 --> 02:36:25,140
Yeah, Diane.

2857
02:36:25,380 --> 02:36:25,780
Yeah.

2858
02:36:28,060 --> 02:36:28,460
Diane.

2859
02:36:28,700 --> 02:36:31,100
You think you're good at this game?

2860
02:36:34,080 --> 02:36:34,680
KAPOIT!

2861
02:36:35,060 --> 02:36:35,660
Whoa!

2862
02:36:37,740 --> 02:36:39,580
Someone does not like Diane.

2863
02:36:43,340 --> 02:36:46,720
What even is in the care package anyway?

2864
02:36:50,780 --> 02:36:51,140
Alright.

2865
02:36:51,720 --> 02:36:53,960
Grabbing vault prowler.

2866
02:36:55,260 --> 02:36:57,440
No long range, which isn't ideal.

2867
02:36:58,120 --> 02:36:59,700
I have a hemlock and you want to trade?

2868
02:36:59,980 --> 02:37:00,720
Yeah, I'll trade it.

2869
02:37:00,740 --> 02:37:02,240
I'll trade it for a pallet.

2870
02:37:04,580 --> 02:37:05,200
Nice.

2871
02:37:09,950 --> 02:37:10,150
Hey!

2872
02:37:12,950 --> 02:37:13,570
Whoa!

2873
02:37:16,410 --> 02:37:18,190
I'm grabbing the...

2874
02:37:18,190 --> 02:37:18,930
What?

2875
02:37:19,390 --> 02:37:19,630
Oh!

2876
02:37:20,430 --> 02:37:22,370
Guess I'm not grabbing the fucking bat.

2877
02:37:23,870 --> 02:37:24,890
On my ping.

2878
02:37:25,330 --> 02:37:26,130
Oh, my battery!

2879
02:37:27,090 --> 02:37:28,450
My battery for my white armor.

2880
02:37:30,990 --> 02:37:32,070
Where is this?

2881
02:37:33,350 --> 02:37:33,730
I don't know.

2882
02:37:33,830 --> 02:37:34,430
Did I pick it up?

2883
02:37:38,300 --> 02:37:39,320
He's over there.

2884
02:37:39,600 --> 02:37:40,180
So far.

2885
02:37:42,300 --> 02:37:42,920
Oh my god.

2886
02:37:43,040 --> 02:37:44,820
They have like a little head glitch area.

2887
02:37:45,220 --> 02:37:46,860
Wingman, Eva, Bo, and Kramer.

2888
02:37:47,040 --> 02:37:50,060
Oh, they just took away the prowler for the Eva 8.

2889
02:37:52,100 --> 02:37:52,660
I see them.

2890
02:37:52,720 --> 02:37:53,740
They're all over there.

2891
02:37:54,240 --> 02:37:55,640
I had no reg just now.

2892
02:37:56,860 --> 02:37:57,980
No, he knows I have white.

2893
02:37:59,740 --> 02:38:00,060
What?

2894
02:38:00,440 --> 02:38:01,080
He knows I have white.

2895
02:38:01,160 --> 02:38:01,480
Oh!

2896
02:38:01,820 --> 02:38:02,220
Shit!

2897
02:38:03,220 --> 02:38:04,860
That like booted me off almost.

2898
02:38:05,100 --> 02:38:06,640
I thought you were Chinese.

2899
02:38:17,910 --> 02:38:22,370
Okay, I don't... I don't have shields anymore.

2900
02:38:23,670 --> 02:38:25,150
They took everything from me.

2901
02:38:27,730 --> 02:38:30,150
They took everything from me.

2902
02:38:32,450 --> 02:38:33,890
Grab the Custic, you went up there?

2903
02:38:34,010 --> 02:38:36,290
Alright, I'm gonna... I'm fucked!

2904
02:38:37,050 --> 02:38:38,290
I am so fine.

2905
02:38:42,550 --> 02:38:45,710
Oh, I'm gonna bat with my white armor.

2906
02:38:49,250 --> 02:38:50,210
Is this...

2907
02:38:50,210 --> 02:38:51,170
Is this ours?

2908
02:38:51,410 --> 02:38:52,010
I can't tell.

2909
02:38:53,110 --> 02:38:54,790
Girl, do we look like we have a Bangalore?

2910
02:38:54,910 --> 02:38:55,450
Yes, we do!

2911
02:38:55,630 --> 02:38:56,310
What do you mean?

2912
02:38:57,710 --> 02:38:58,410
Oh, what the fuck?

2913
02:38:58,710 --> 02:39:01,010
Oh, Nico changes every time I look at him!

2914
02:39:02,330 --> 02:39:05,110
Does it look like we have a Bangalore?

2915
02:39:05,610 --> 02:39:06,410
I'm fucked.

2916
02:39:07,050 --> 02:39:09,050
I got shot from the back.

2917
02:39:12,730 --> 02:39:16,650
Wait, are you alive?

2918
02:39:21,880 --> 02:39:24,370
I am very afraid for your life right now.

2919
02:39:25,600 --> 02:39:26,340
I do not...

2920
02:39:27,080 --> 02:39:27,320
Shit!

2921
02:39:27,880 --> 02:39:30,820
You are 100% fucked right now.

2922
02:39:31,700 --> 02:39:32,280
You know what?

2923
02:39:33,840 --> 02:39:35,140
You know what?

2924
02:39:35,160 --> 02:39:36,340
We can do one more game.

2925
02:39:36,520 --> 02:39:37,300
We can...

2926
02:39:43,320 --> 02:39:45,700
Oh, literally, what the fuck?

2927
02:39:46,040 --> 02:39:46,560
You know what?

2928
02:39:46,680 --> 02:39:48,080
Yeah, I can do one more.

2929
02:39:49,080 --> 02:39:50,720
I can keep going.

2930
02:39:52,240 --> 02:39:54,020
The ride never ends.

2931
02:39:55,600 --> 02:39:56,820
Doki, are you getting me flowers tomorrow?

2932
02:39:58,100 --> 02:39:58,320
What?

2933
02:39:59,260 --> 02:40:01,140
Shouldn't you be getting my dog flowers?

2934
02:40:02,840 --> 02:40:05,840
I would if you gave me your new address when I asked for it.

2935
02:40:06,260 --> 02:40:06,880
I did!

2936
02:40:07,140 --> 02:40:08,300
I sent you...

2937
02:40:08,300 --> 02:40:09,620
You literally never did!

2938
02:40:09,700 --> 02:40:10,020

2939
02:40:10,620 --> 02:40:11,820
No, no, no, no, no, I'm gonna look.

2940
02:40:11,960 --> 02:40:12,380
I'm gonna type it.

2941
02:40:12,460 --> 02:40:13,140
I'm gonna type for it.

2942
02:40:14,460 --> 02:40:15,560
No, no, no, no, I did.

2943
02:40:15,660 --> 02:40:15,880
I did.

2944
02:40:16,500 --> 02:40:19,340
I remember texting you my address.

2945
02:40:19,980 --> 02:40:21,000
You never did.

2946
02:40:21,000 --> 02:40:21,280
I did.

2947
02:40:23,520 --> 02:40:24,040
I did.

2948
02:40:24,700 --> 02:40:26,380
I 100% did.

2949
02:40:27,260 --> 02:40:27,980
I remember.

2950
02:40:30,480 --> 02:40:31,540
It's right there.

2951
02:40:32,640 --> 02:40:33,600
Where's right there?

2952
02:40:34,820 --> 02:40:36,220
It's literally right there.

2953
02:40:36,820 --> 02:40:38,160
Where is right there?

2954
02:40:38,360 --> 02:40:39,500

This is your fault.

2971
02:41:55,830 --> 02:41:59,030
I got too distracted for being wife number four.

02:42:01,590 --> 02:42:02,850

02:42:04,770 --> 02:42:05,610

There's no fucking way!

2986
02:43:03,390 --> 02:43:07,850
One to three are ten plus years!

02:43:11,420 --> 02:43:12,060
Three in a row?

2988
02:43:12,140 --> 02:43:12,940
Three in a row.

2989
02:43:13,340 --> 02:43:14,300
Three in a row.

2990
02:43:16,140 --> 02:43:17,960
I have friends.

2991
02:43:17,960 --> 02:43:19,160
I have friends.

2992
02:43:20,000 --> 02:43:21,220
Hey, wife number one, who?

2993
02:43:21,340 --> 02:43:22,720
Who is wife number one?

2994
02:43:22,860 --> 02:43:24,340
I literally told you, Priscilla!

2995
02:43:25,260 --> 02:43:28,500
You said like you've known her since like fucking before you
were born.

2996
02:43:28,760 --> 02:43:30,020
That doesn't make sense.

2997
02:43:30,220 --> 02:43:33,060
No, I'm saying that our families knew each other before we
were

2998
02:43:36,160 --> 02:43:36,160
born.

2999
02:43:36,340 --> 02:43:36,800
Oh.

3000
02:43:37,580 --> 02:43:39,080
So it wasn't by choice.

3001
02:43:46,230 --> 02:43:46,690
Why?

3002
02:43:49,470 --> 02:43:51,750
Are you saying I was an arranged name?

3003
02:43:53,890 --> 02:43:57,270
Oh my god, did you know my mom almost put me in an arranged
marriage when I was young?

3004
02:43:57,290 --> 02:43:58,710
You're all, yeah, Priscilla.

3005
02:44:11,590 --> 02:44:11,990
Alright,

3006
02:44:15,230 --> 02:44:16,170

Nico will be fine.

3023
02:45:41,360 --> 02:45:42,340
See, Nico got it.

3024
02:45:44,280 --> 02:45:45,160
Is that everybody?

Nice.

3027
02:45:50,940 --> 02:45:56,160
I missed when, like, everybody in our lobby was clearly
bronze, or rookie.

3028
02:45:57,120 --> 02:45:58,100
I missed that.

3029
02:45:58,880 --> 02:46:01,080
When the people get better.

3030
02:46:02,840 --> 02:46:04,900
I like how someone was like, yes, I have a wife.

3031
02:46:04,960 --> 02:46:06,400
She goes to a different school.

3032
02:46:09,720 --> 02:46:10,520
Yeah, you don't know her.

3033
02:46:11,360 --> 02:46:13,620
Yeah, you just never met her, you know.

3034
02:46:20,720 --> 02:46:21,380
Nico is like...

3035
02:46:21,380 --> 02:46:22,380
What did Nico do?

3036
02:46:22,760 --> 02:46:26,680
Nico didn't save our lives today, like in this game.

3037
02:46:27,200 --> 02:46:28,880
He's literally some guy.

3038
02:46:29,200 --> 02:46:30,020
Wake up.

3039
02:46:31,600 --> 02:46:33,740
Why didn't he say that about us?

3040
02:46:33,980 --> 02:46:35,020
Clearly some girls.

3041
02:46:36,140 --> 02:46:36,920
How are we different?

3042
02:46:37,280 --> 02:46:38,620

3043
02:46:38,980 --> 02:46:39,160

3044
02:46:39,920 --> 02:46:41,780
They're simping over some guy.

3045
02:46:42,940 --> 02:46:44,720

3046

Wake up.

3049
02:46:49,680 --> 02:46:52,660
Gumi, how are we different from Nico?

3050
02:46:53,260 --> 02:46:55,860
Other than the fact that he's a guy and has a dick.

3051
02:46:55,860 --> 02:46:56,200
Okay, simmer down.

3052
02:46:56,440 --> 02:46:57,020

02:47:01,520 --> 02:47:01,880

3057
02:47:03,300 --> 02:47:03,740
Simmer down.

3064
02:48:10,700 --> 02:48:12,080
You need my therapist.

You need...

3066
02:48:13,400 --> 02:48:16,040
There are some issues to unpack there.

3067
02:48:16,500 --> 02:48:20,200
There is a lot of issues we need to work on.

3068
02:48:21,820 --> 02:48:23,000
I played Jet in Valorant.

3069
02:48:23,900 --> 02:48:25,420
Oh my god, you're...

3070
02:48:26,200 --> 02:48:27,720
You're a Jet, Daddy.

Oh!

3072
02:48:35,280 --> 02:48:37,940
This is why I never play Valorant.

3073
02:48:38,140 --> 02:48:42,000
I cannot do the e-couples in Valorant.

3074
02:48:42,480 --> 02:48:46,240
It's like, Overwatch walked, so Valorant could run.

3075
02:48:47,960 --> 02:48:48,880
Do you like him?

3076
02:48:49,240 --> 02:48:49,820
Hold on.

3077
02:48:50,520 --> 02:48:51,040

3078
02:48:51,880 --> 02:48:52,220

3082
02:48:59,940 --> 02:49:01,580

3090
02:49:40,780 --> 02:49:43,040
I thought my game crashed, but my Discord crashed.

3091
02:49:43,640 --> 02:49:44,740
My Discord crashed.

3092
02:49:46,160 --> 02:49:47,320
It's okay, I'm fine.

3093
02:49:48,440 --> 02:49:49,760
I thought it was my apex.

3094
02:49:53,220 --> 02:49:53,940
Whoa, what?

3095
02:49:55,320 --> 02:49:56,260

02:50:05,450 --> 02:50:06,870
He'll be fine.

3099
02:50:07,090 --> 02:50:08,610
There's two teams, there's two teams.

3100
02:50:12,470 --> 02:50:14,150
Nico is just a concubine.

3101
02:50:14,870 --> 02:50:15,390
Whoa!

3102
02:50:18,000 --> 02:50:19,820

02:50:23,500 --> 02:50:25,260
My chat's gonna be so angry!

3105
02:50:27,100 --> 02:50:28,200
What the fuck is...

3106
02:50:29,300 --> 02:50:30,040
Wait, where are they?

3107
02:50:30,480 --> 02:50:31,260
What the fuck?

3108
02:50:31,480 --> 02:50:32,860
My Discord keeps crashing.

3109
02:50:34,880 --> 02:50:35,480
Oh no.

3110
02:50:36,260 --> 02:50:36,880
Oh no!

3111
02:50:38,200 --> 02:50:38,900
Are you okay?

3112
02:50:39,160 --> 02:50:41,120
No, my discord keeps crashing!

3113
02:50:41,900 --> 02:50:43,660
My toaster is overheating!

3114
02:50:43,960 --> 02:50:45,440
Sorry, and you could get me over there.

3115
02:50:45,680 --> 02:50:46,300
Don't worry!

3116
02:50:46,820 --> 02:50:50,480
Oh my god, don't worry!

3117
02:50:50,480 --> 02:50:51,540
Save me.

3118
02:50:52,520 --> 02:50:53,700
Oh my god.

3119
02:50:54,120 --> 02:50:56,800
Yeah, maybe it is a PC problem.

3120
02:50:59,340 --> 02:50:59,940
Maybe...

3121
02:50:59,940 --> 02:50:59,980
Maybe...

3122
02:51:01,420 --> 02:51:04,120
Maybe it is a PC issue.

3123
02:51:06,360 --> 02:51:06,840
Oh, no.

3124
02:51:06,900 --> 02:51:07,720
I can't tell yet.

3125
02:51:08,340 --> 02:51:09,280
I'll say it.

3126
02:51:09,540 --> 02:51:10,700
I'll say it.

3127
02:51:10,800 --> 02:51:11,180
Say what?

3128
02:51:11,360 --> 02:51:14,480
Nico is but the mashed potatoes and you're the steak to me.

3129
02:51:15,120 --> 02:51:16,080
You're the main dish.

3130
02:51:16,400 --> 02:51:18,200
Wait, then what's wife number one?

3131
02:51:22,580 --> 02:51:27,240
If I am the steak, then what's wife number one?

3132
02:51:29,900 --> 02:51:31,360
You're gonna hate to hear this?

3133
02:51:31,600 --> 02:51:32,700
I think you need to cover your ears.

3134
02:51:33,040 --> 02:51:33,280
No.

3135
02:51:33,680 --> 02:51:34,720
I can take it.

3136
02:51:35,620 --> 02:51:36,500
I can take it.

You can see my food?

3142
02:52:18,240 --> 02:52:19,840
I don't know what that means.

3143
02:52:22,420 --> 02:52:22,780
Okay.

02:52:24,560 --> 02:52:25,700

02:52:38,560 --> 02:52:40,140

I thought I thought I could live that.

3162
02:53:32,390 --> 02:53:36,590
I like how you didn't res me and Nico res me.

3163
02:53:37,470 --> 02:53:39,170
Girl, I was fighting for my life.

3164
02:53:39,250 --> 02:53:40,790
You're trying to confirm your safety.

3165
02:53:40,790 --> 02:53:43,790
I bet if I was wife number one, you would res me instantly.

3166
02:53:44,130 --> 02:53:45,350
I kill it.

3167
02:53:48,030 --> 02:53:50,610
I don't know.

3168
02:53:50,770 --> 02:53:51,570
I have a feeling.

3169
02:53:56,620 --> 02:53:58,780
It's just a little feeling I have.

3170
02:54:05,130 --> 02:54:09,870
That was the fucking biggest nade I've ever seen.

3171
02:54:10,590 --> 02:54:11,710
They cooked that shit up.

3172
02:54:12,350 --> 02:54:14,330
I don't think we should head to Nico.

3173
02:54:16,310 --> 02:54:16,570
Go!

3174
02:54:16,950 --> 02:54:18,150

02:56:49,370 --> 02:56:52,190
It's either way too hot or way too fucking cold.

3206
02:56:53,270 --> 02:56:53,890

3216
02:57:08,850 --> 02:57:10,450

3217
02:57:14,750 --> 02:57:14,870

02:57:26,550 --> 02:57:28,210
Don't worry, I yelled at Nico for you.

3223
02:57:28,730 --> 02:57:29,170
Oh, you did?

Yeah.

3226
02:57:30,830 --> 02:57:31,950
Yeah, but you might as well do it again.

3227
02:57:32,310 --> 02:57:32,930
Teach him a lesson.

3228
02:57:33,910 --> 02:57:35,510
No, I'm a nice person.

3229
02:57:36,490 --> 02:57:37,230
Screw you, Nico.

3230
02:57:39,570 --> 02:57:40,570
Who said that?

3231
02:57:49,100 --> 02:57:50,560
Who said that?

3232
02:57:51,140 --> 02:57:51,780
Oh my god.

3234
02:57:57,200 --> 02:57:58,680
Was your window open?

3235
02:57:59,020 --> 02:57:59,420
Goomy?

3236
02:58:01,460 --> 02:58:02,960

02:58:03,280 --> 02:58:03,880
I'm so scared.

3238
02:58:04,400 --> 02:58:05,480

02:58:05,980 --> 02:58:06,300
Don't turn.

3240
02:58:06,520 --> 02:58:06,960
That ghost.

3241
02:58:07,880 --> 02:58:09,700
Don't look back.

3242
02:58:10,880 --> 02:58:11,980

3243
02:58:12,660 --> 02:58:14,120

I'm for real LG.

3249
02:58:32,380 --> 02:58:34,500
I've never been so LG in my life.

3250
02:58:38,880 --> 02:58:40,080
How the fuck scan this?

3251
02:58:40,560 --> 02:58:41,840
There's people over here.

3252
02:58:42,580 --> 02:58:42,820
Let's go.

3253
02:58:43,420 --> 02:58:43,560
Go.

3254
02:58:43,840 --> 02:58:44,560
Sorry, Nico.

3255
02:58:44,820 --> 02:58:45,620
I'm just cranky.

3256
02:58:45,720 --> 02:58:47,080
I haven't had my afternoon nap.

3257
02:58:47,480 --> 02:58:48,340
See you in voice.

3258
02:58:50,460 --> 02:58:52,100
Apologize to him right now.

3259
02:58:52,640 --> 02:58:53,000
Nico.

3260
02:58:58,220 --> 02:58:58,480
Ah!

3261
02:59:06,890 --> 02:59:09,150
Never do that again in front of me.

3262
02:59:09,330 --> 02:59:10,250
Never do that.

3263
02:59:10,810 --> 02:59:12,670
Never do that again in front of me.

3264
02:59:13,050 --> 02:59:14,470
I feel so tired.

3265
02:59:18,090 --> 02:59:18,630
One four.

3266
02:59:21,250 --> 02:59:21,770
He ran.

3267
02:59:22,270 --> 02:59:23,690
He's running like a little baby.

3268
02:59:26,770 --> 02:59:27,970
Go Nico, go.

3269
02:59:28,450 --> 02:59:28,570
Oh.

3270
02:59:32,670 --> 02:59:33,610
Where are they?

3271
02:59:35,210 --> 02:59:36,490
Uh, they ran down.

3272
02:59:37,010 --> 02:59:38,190
They ran all the way down?

3273
02:59:38,710 --> 02:59:39,470
Wait, there's a wench.

3274
02:59:40,070 --> 02:59:41,590
They didn't run all the way down, liar.

3275
02:59:41,650 --> 02:59:42,670
Wait, there's one right here, right here.

3276
02:59:44,570 --> 02:59:44,790
Oh.

3277
02:59:47,310 --> 02:59:48,490
Boomi, no, don't die.

3278
02:59:48,950 --> 02:59:49,810
There's one on me, too.

3279
02:59:50,250 --> 02:59:50,850
Oh, I'm dead.

3280
02:59:51,470 --> 02:59:51,750
No!

3281
02:59:52,930 --> 02:59:54,350
I didn't get my one!

3282
02:59:55,330 --> 02:59:56,670
Maybe I'm also tired.

3283
02:59:59,450 --> 03:00:00,130
That's fine.

3284
03:00:00,310 --> 03:00:00,790
I believe.

3285
03:00:03,610 --> 03:00:05,130
Look, he had a destructor.

3286
03:00:07,930 --> 03:00:14,170
Look, all I'm saying is if I had his same loadout, I would
have been alive.

3287
03:00:17,310 --> 03:00:18,850
That's all I'm saying.

3288
03:00:20,970 --> 03:00:23,070
I'll leave you wholeheartedly.

3289
03:00:23,930 --> 03:00:26,010
No, wait, I swear, watch.

3290
03:00:27,490 --> 03:00:28,710
I'm gonna become the seer.

3291
03:00:30,690 --> 03:00:32,570
Okay, I might be dead because, um...

3292
03:00:33,610 --> 03:00:35,530
Okay, yeah, I'm 100% dead.

3293
03:00:35,890 --> 03:00:36,270
I am.

3294
03:00:37,290 --> 03:00:38,330
I'm so fucked.

3295
03:00:39,150 --> 03:00:40,770
Please, someone, defend me.

3296
03:00:41,650 --> 03:00:42,170
I'm streaming.

3297
03:00:43,950 --> 03:00:45,270
I'm streaming, defend me.

3298
03:00:49,020 --> 03:00:49,820
Where's his load out?

3299
03:00:52,060 --> 03:00:52,540
Wait.

3300
03:00:53,260 --> 03:00:53,980
Where is his load?

3301
03:00:54,100 --> 03:00:54,780
Where is the guy?

3302
03:00:59,260 --> 03:01:01,140
Where the fuck is the guy that killed?

3303
03:01:01,180 --> 03:01:01,700
There he is.

3304
03:01:02,700 --> 03:01:03,180
Oh.

3305
03:01:04,960 --> 03:01:05,440
Oh.

3306
03:01:05,460 --> 03:01:05,740
Alright.

3307
03:01:07,060 --> 03:01:08,400
Who shot us earlier?

3308
03:01:10,500 --> 03:01:11,640
Oh, he's over there.

3309
03:01:17,920 --> 03:01:18,560
Oh, okay.

3310
03:01:19,800 --> 03:01:21,820
I didn't want to fight in zone, but I guess we will.

3311
03:01:22,760 --> 03:01:23,640
I craft one.

3312
03:01:24,220 --> 03:01:25,200
Well, I'm outside of zone.

3313
03:01:25,420 --> 03:01:26,720
Oh, you guys are so...

3314
03:01:26,720 --> 03:01:27,640
Balls deep.

3315
03:01:28,220 --> 03:01:28,620
Yep.

3316
03:01:31,280 --> 03:01:31,720
Um...

3317
03:01:31,720 --> 03:01:33,200
I don't know how.

3318
03:01:34,020 --> 03:01:34,760
They're flesh.

3319
03:01:36,880 --> 03:01:38,000
Someone go to zone.

3320
03:01:38,220 --> 03:01:38,600
Goodbye.

3321
03:01:39,260 --> 03:01:39,800
Wait, what?

3322
03:01:39,900 --> 03:01:41,380
Oh hey, I got a kill!

3323
03:01:42,440 --> 03:01:43,860
I did that.

3324
03:01:44,660 --> 03:01:45,620
You smile.

3325
03:01:46,040 --> 03:01:47,220
It was me smile.

3326
03:01:51,500 --> 03:01:55,500
See, I told you, the moment I take this man's loadout, I
win.

3327
03:01:56,480 --> 03:01:58,120
Even though he died by a ring.

3328
03:01:59,280 --> 03:02:01,220
Can't wait to be quick to me, yo.

3329
03:02:02,040 --> 03:02:04,880
Builder's just gonna take the car and then come back here.

3330
03:02:08,160 --> 03:02:10,000
Oh wait, why are they all dying in a ring?

3331
03:02:10,160 --> 03:02:10,820
Do they not have heals?

3332
03:02:12,580 --> 03:02:13,460
Probably not.

3333
03:02:13,840 --> 03:02:15,580
I guess not.

3334
03:02:18,110 --> 03:02:19,810
Oh, bastards alert!

3335
03:02:20,370 --> 03:02:21,730
Oh, I'm coming over.

3336
03:02:22,450 --> 03:02:23,170
Bastard alert, Nico.

3337
03:02:23,530 --> 03:02:24,130
Get them.

3338
03:02:29,640 --> 03:02:30,760
Where are they?

3339
03:02:32,080 --> 03:02:34,280
Alright, I opened the door so they all know we're here now.

3340
03:02:35,980 --> 03:02:37,060
Wait, where are they?

3341
03:02:37,340 --> 03:02:37,520
Okay.

3342
03:02:39,620 --> 03:02:40,720
Okay, I have white armor.

3343
03:02:41,380 --> 03:02:41,960
I'm a little scared.

3344
03:02:43,460 --> 03:02:46,460
Um, there's that team behind us as well, so we gotta be
careful.

3345

I don't have any long range, so I require you guys to do all
the long range for me.

3350
03:03:33,520 --> 03:03:34,420
Where's your teammate?

Oh my god, he's in front of you!

3352

I can't get the cross.

3426
03:06:50,130 --> 03:06:51,150
I'm not batting a bat.

3427
03:06:51,930 --> 03:06:53,490
You fucking kidding me.

3428
03:06:54,770 --> 03:06:55,570

3429
03:06:57,350 --> 03:06:59,270
I'm worried about our backs, though, to be fair.

3430
03:07:02,570 --> 03:07:03,070

3437
03:07:21,000 --> 03:07:21,900

He's full running.

3439
03:07:26,080 --> 03:07:27,200
Nico's got it.

3440
03:07:28,480 --> 03:07:29,440
I knew it.

3441
03:07:29,460 --> 03:07:30,540
I can always believe in Nico.

3442
03:07:31,580 --> 03:07:32,740
Why are they...

3443
03:07:32,740 --> 03:07:33,860
What are they doing?

3444
03:07:35,280 --> 03:07:36,360
They're so scared.

3445
03:07:36,480 --> 03:07:37,380
Goomi, run after him.

3446
03:07:37,600 --> 03:07:37,880

03:07:38,420 --> 03:07:39,380

3449
03:07:41,500 --> 03:07:42,480

Oh, there he is.

3455
03:08:04,790 --> 03:08:05,830
Wait, is he dead?

3456
03:08:06,310 --> 03:08:07,810
Oh, he's dead to the ring.

3457
03:08:08,370 --> 03:08:08,410
Dead.

3458
03:08:09,970 --> 03:08:15,390
Wait, that's the team that tried to kill us last time in the
original house.

3459
03:08:17,490 --> 03:08:22,150
Did you know what the You know when we were at the little
the towers?

3460
03:08:24,890 --> 03:08:25,950
That was them.

3461
03:08:26,250 --> 03:08:26,970
They just finished the fight.

3462
03:08:28,330 --> 03:08:29,170
That's last two.

3463
03:08:29,810 --> 03:08:30,350
Last two squad.

3464
03:08:30,510 --> 03:08:30,830

Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

3467
03:08:35,070 --> 03:08:37,550
I don't know if this is going to hit, but I'm going to hell
marry this.

3468
03:08:39,210 --> 03:08:40,330
It'll be so smart.

3469
03:08:40,510 --> 03:08:41,070
Trust me.

3470
03:08:43,270 --> 03:08:45,290
It is definitely not close to anybody.

3471
03:08:47,250 --> 03:08:47,930
I cracked one.

3472
03:08:54,150 --> 03:08:55,750
Oh shit!

3473
03:08:56,870 --> 03:08:56,890
Anyway.

3474
03:09:01,920 --> 03:09:02,440
Am I left?

3475
03:09:02,800 --> 03:09:03,380
Behind us?

3476
03:09:05,300 --> 03:09:06,900

03:09:14,500 --> 03:09:15,080
Oh, over there!

3481
03:09:15,600 --> 03:09:16,180
Wait, what?

3482
03:09:17,240 --> 03:09:18,600
What is happening?

3483
03:09:19,140 --> 03:09:20,180
They're super spread.

3484
03:09:21,140 --> 03:09:22,540
That's what's happening.

3485
03:09:23,500 --> 03:09:25,140
Is this shield swap here?

3486
03:09:25,820 --> 03:09:26,420
That's fine, I cover.

3487
03:09:26,960 --> 03:09:28,040
Yeah, they're so far, they're so far.

3488
03:09:29,700 --> 03:09:30,600
I took this shield swap.

3489
03:09:34,280 --> 03:09:35,680
Holy shit, they're so far.

3490
03:09:36,660 --> 03:09:37,360
Poor guy.
