looking like a ninth place or what yeah yeah what's the

6
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:54,960

10
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:30,620
if you lose this tournament jen then that means those the
other wins they were luck.

11
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:31,800
They were lucky.

12
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:32,560
They were lucky.

13
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:35,060
This is where real skill matters now.

14
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,500
Punching and shit?

15
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:37,280
Like a man.

16
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:41,080
No weapons is real skill.

17
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:43,740
It's all about your brain at that point.

18
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,540
It's here to test your brain.

19
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:47,260
Oh shit, you're fucking right.

20
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,340
Wait, do you have aim assist on punch?

21
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:49,980
No, no, wait.

22
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:50,960
He does.

23
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:53,240
Wait, does do you?

24
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,180
Did he take that out?

25
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:54,820
No, what?

26
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:55,420
He got rid of it.

27
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,080
Yeah, I think I'm good.

28
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,600
He got rid of it.

29
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:57,960
Why?

30
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:58,920
He used to be in the game.

31
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,860
He used to be in the game.

32
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,840
Yeah, it was.

33
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,740
You used to be insistent on punching.

34
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:04,360
Why?

35
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:07,600
Control-A-Play should have everything they want.

36
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,420
That's so true.

37
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,060
Yeah, might as well.

38
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,380
Give them everything.

39
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,440
Might as well.

40
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,840
They're basically keeping the game alive at this point.

41
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:23,780
Wait, I can't find the code.

42
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:24,320
Where is it?

43
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:28,980
It's in the code section.

44
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:29,860
It literally says code.

45
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:33,260
It has a PC icon or a laptop icon.

46
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:33,980
Oh, I see.

47
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:34,640
Thank you.

48
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,180
Yeah, first game.

49
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:41,920
What are we playing?

50
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,420
We're playing Fuse.

51
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:44,880
Clostick Watson.

52
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:46,400
Fuse Clostick Watson?

53
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:47,360
Yeah.

54
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:47,960
Okay.

55
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,660
I can do Watson.

56
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:50,720
I'll just put fences.

57
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,080
I'll be the fences, girl.

58
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:58,340
I can do anyone but Fuse because I don't play him.

59
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,960
I don't have him unlocked because I hate him.

60
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:00,440
I'm not going to unlock.

61
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:01,160
Wait, you don't have him?

62
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,780
How many tokens do you have?

63
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:07,560
I do, but I played maybe like two games on Kostik
realistically.

64
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:10,780
Wait, but just you must have a million.

65
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,400
I have a million legend tokens.

66
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,440
You must have the tokens to unlock.

67
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,980
I don't unlock them.

68
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:16,380
I just.

69
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,200
Oh, so you don't like money?

70
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,840

92
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:52,060

costic because fused you're just kind of spam okay but is he

93
00:04:52,060 --> 00:05:00,840
a good i'm gonna say like is he i don't think i've ever seen
like caustic willingly like has he ever played like caustic

94
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:07,700
willingly he's a controller player hey i want a championship
of caustic i'm just saying yeah yeah that's why you're

95
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:17,980
playing caustic well like fuse is op you can stick people
and shit like it's fun oh so then you don't want to win if

96
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:30,600
you why would you justify yeah 46 the clash character all
good sorry we have plenty of time i think we were supposed

97
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:37,720
to we were supposed to start like seven minutes ago but apex
stuff never starts in time so we're good to go oh yeah yeah

98
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,340
we're good to go

99
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:55,030
oh okay look at team one please look at team one team four
then team two how are these fair okay yeah because they're

100
00:05:55,030 --> 00:06:03,690
not using guns what the do you mean half of those players
are controller players they don't have brains so what they

101
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:11,190
don't have brains it's literally melee what are you gonna do
punch you better yeah i mean oh they punch is better or

102
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:19,350
something i don't know oh yeah when you become a pro player
you punch people better like they add 10 plus more damage if

103
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:28,930
you get into pro league is that it for each legend yeah but
imagine we survive to end zone like caustic old easy win we

104
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:35,930
don't even exactly unless they also have unless my watson
all eats it that is true yeah i think we can assume that

105
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:42,370
every team will have a caustic and watson it's okay it's
okay it's okay we have there's gonna be one team with like a

106
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:49,830
crypto we have yeah i feel so yeah it has to be but it's
okay we can i can put fences again Yeah, yeah, yeah.

107
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:54,030
They can crypto out me once, but I have infinite fences.

108
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:55,910
Well, we'll slap all ourselves too.

109
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:57,770
You're not real.

110
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:00,930
They're gonna start punching the generator out.

111
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:05,650
Not if you're not punching them away from the gen.

112
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,690
We play protect the president.

113
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:09,450
The generator is our president.

114
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:10,550
It really is.

115
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:12,470
Wait, get the generators, the two generators.

116
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:13,270
You know what I want?

117
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:14,330
Oh, shit, you're right.

118
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:15,190
You're right.

119
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:15,970
They can't kill.

120
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:17,250
They can't kill all the gems.

121
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:18,670
So what we do at the start of the game, we go run around.

122
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:21,010
And we just farm fucking armor to purple.

123
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:21,630
Oh my god, wait, you're right.

124
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:22,490
And then we'll go to zone.

125
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:22,910
All right?

126
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:23,790
You're right, you're right.

127
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:24,450
You're thinking.

128
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:26,230
You're actually using your brain for real.

129
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:27,630
Hey, what brain?

130
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:34,810
Just tap into Zero's brain right now.

131
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:36,630
I'm tapping into it.

132
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:37,390
He's going to get rolled.

133
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:39,310
Dang it.

He's so nervous.

136
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:42,930
He's going to be so scared.

137
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:45,610
If you beat Zero, you can become IGL.

138
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:47,390

Yeah, how does that work?

225
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,510
I spent a lot of money on this game.

226
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:27,070
I'll just say that.

227
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:27,970

00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:36,570
So I'll get certain skin.

232
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:38,390
So you spent money on a free to play game.

233
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:39,530
So you said...

234
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:45,490
All right, drop us to victory.

00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:52,530
I don't get I don't get how you think that justifies you
spending money on it But it really doesn't like I do not

238
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:00,190
That's okay.

239
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:06,690
I actually spent money on the Mirage statue Recently like I
was kind of spending money on this game and then recently I

245
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:25,530
He saved me $300 from this event.

246
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:26,310
I was saying.

247
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:29,270
All right, it's looking.

248
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:35,110
All right, look, if things don't do so well, maybe he'll
hack your game and you'll be back to life or something.

249
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:38,050
Okay, I'm going to grab...

250
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:39,670
We can grab heroes and stuff, right?

251
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:40,750
Yeah, yeah.

252
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:42,930
Yeah, I mean, that would be fucked up if we had.

253
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:43,470
I'm not going to lie.

254
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:45,830
I grabbed, like, a flatline vault because of everything.

255
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:47,990
Oh my god.

256
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:52,070
Wait, can we like grab guns and throw the guns at them to
distract them?

257
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:54,370
Oh, no, no, no.

258
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:55,270
Wait, no.

259
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,450
Imagine guns that damage when you throw at them.

260
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:57,670
Don't think of it this way.

261
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:02,070
We grab the gun, throw it at them, and then they shoot us,
and then they get disqualified.

262
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:06,170
I'm just thinking they pick it up.

263
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:07,590
You might be cooking a little too hard.

264
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:09,230
You're cooking up too much.

265
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:10,130
What do you mean?

266
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:15,230
They're gonna like pick up the gun and then they'll pick up
the gun accidentally because you throw it at them.

267
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:29,390
us then they get disqualified for using the gun because it
didn't say we can't have it in our inventory i can't it

268
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:39,870
works i'll bet you that can you have a gun on you though
yeah we won't be using i don't know how if you shoot it like

269
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:45,010
accidentally it's no fun yeah but if you don't shoot it at a
person it should be fine right okay i'm carrying an

270
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:47,450
alternator you're gonna You're carrying an alternate.

271
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:48,290
I'm carrying it.

272
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:50,090
Why are you gonna throw the gun at a person?

273
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:51,650
Oh my god, we should throw a gun at a person.

274
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:53,430
I have a Mozam too.

275
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:55,150

You think they actually think about what they're doing?

289
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:15,910

Okay, let's get the juicer and then get the ring console

312
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:22,510
Open our salt bin.

313
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:26,190
There's no way I'll get punched out on the ring console.

314
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:27,230
There's no fucking way.

315
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:28,330
No, no, no, no.

316
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:29,710
If they do, I'll just snade them.

317
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:30,010
Yeah.

318
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:30,330
Yeah, no.

319
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:30,850
I'm gonna...

320
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:34,850
I'll make a ring around the ring console so they can't...

321
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:36,890
They can't come punch you this way.

322
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:39,010
They can't punch me out if there's a...

323
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:40,890
If there's a barrier...

324
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:42,530
This is it.

325
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:46,370
Alright, here we go.

326
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:52,170
Oh my gosh, my brain is cooking up some six shots for this.

327
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:57,110
We just need tempo to not watch and we'll be fine.

328
00:17:57,850 --> 00:17:58,590
Oh my god.

329
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,450
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

332
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:05,190
I can't see them.

333
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:05,590

I was gonna say we could craft ourselves if we can't.

353
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:01,650
We can't craft ourselves.

354
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:03,650

Watson.

367
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:37,950
It's a little scary at endgame.

368
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:40,830
Oh, it's going to be awful.

369
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:43,510
I feel like we should get another ring console.

370
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:44,830
We should get that.

371
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:45,210
Yeah, ring console.

372
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:46,310
Oh, should we get this one too?

373
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:47,450
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

374
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:48,630
We should just get them in the 40.

375
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:49,690
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

376
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:52,150
Just grab everything so we can't red army in the end.

377
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:53,070
Yeah, yeah.

378
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:56,650
Okay, we just...

379
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:59,710
The moment we hit late game where GG's, it's good to go.

380
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:02,410
We have, like, Watson for...

381
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:12,490
brain is working over time you know i think like i mean if
we really if do you know end zones then you know yeah you

382
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:18,030
have to okay i think there's no way you don't no no no
there's some pros that don't there's that's why no wait wait

383
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:26,210
what are you trying to say i'm trying to say that you're one
of the pros that do know it i hit the 50 50.

384
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:28,250
but others why is it because they're

385
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:33,650
What are you trying to imply?

386
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:35,230
What do you mean by input?

387
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:37,250
What do you...

388
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:38,410
What do you use to play the game?

389
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:40,330
What do you mean?

390
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:41,430
I didn't imply anything.

391
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:43,590
I just said some pros just don't know.

392
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:46,990
Are you trying to say control players are too stupid to
know?

393
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:48,270
Yeah, that's true.

394
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:51,650
I'm not even going to deny it.

395
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:54,730
Okay.

396
00:21:54,990 --> 00:22:00,330
I put a cage around this one so if anyone wants to do that
ring console, they can.

397
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:02,410
I'm going to go grab it.

398
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:10,710

00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:29,730
Because they don't punch people on the evac because they can
just keep taking over and over again.

403
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:30,770
The sky feeds me.

You can pull a 12 down.

467
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:42,010
How many?

468
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:43,910

470
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:56,790
It's fine But look at their baby cage we have so much space
here.

471
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:57,810
Yeah, literally.

Yeah, waste your gen.

475

Because they're setting it really far from their gen.

476
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:07,850
People are playing Newcastle.

477
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:08,650
That's troll.

478
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:11,310
I guess, oh, like, I think for Endgame.

479
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:13,210
That's really good for Endgame.

480
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:15,330
Well, Newcastle's not going to save them from costing gas.

481
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:16,410
That's true.

482
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:17,050
That's true.

483
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:18,690
Have these guys seen any Gibbies yet?

484
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:19,650
I don't think I've seen a Gibby.

485

00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:57,170
We're okay.

511
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:59,190
This team has to move forward to us then.

512
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:00,010
Oh, he's not coming again!

513
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:01,770
This team has to move to us.

514
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:01,770
What?

515
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:02,050
Red!

516
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:06,370
I've never... We should try farming to red, kind of.

517
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:07,390
Yeah, yeah, we should.

518
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:07,850
We should.

519
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:08,790
I have a thousand.

520
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:09,790
He's trying to stick me, bro.

521
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:10,390
What the fuck?

522
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:11,810
Bro, what is he gonna do?

523
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:13,030
Look after he sticks me.

524
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:14,970
If they stick you, I will literally ult you guys.

525
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:15,350
Okay.

526
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:16,350
Don't worry.

527
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:18,090
And then you'll have to fight to death in the Ring of Fire.

528
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:19,790
No!

529
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:20,390
No!

530
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:22,650
Wait, that's smart.

531
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:25,550
We can spawn in an unlimited arc stars, by the way.

532
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:26,210
Do you have the perk?

533
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:28,930
Yeah, yeah, I have the spawn arc stars.

534
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:30,310
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, this should do it.

535
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:32,190
But I can't do it for myself.

536
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:35,630
I don't- it didn't spawn any yet.

537
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:38,330
It's because we haven't thrown anything out, or done yet.

538
00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:39,130
Oh!

539
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:40,650
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

540
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:41,550
Can I- can I do this?

541
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:42,290
Wait, wait.

542
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:44,090
What if I- Do it, do it.

543
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:45,790
Wait, they're rotating, they're rotating, they're rotating!

00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:49,830
They're cowards!

546
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:52,750
Yeah, I'm gonna punch the gen.

547
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:54,650
Wait, did they spawn the knockstop?

548
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:55,430
They do it against me?

549
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:56,430
Wait, they don't know!

550
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:00,790
I don't know where they're falling.

551
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:01,430
Okay, they patched it.

552
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:02,990
I patched it.

553
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:03,630
Wait, did it?

554
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:05,030
I mean, the enemy has to do it, yeah.

555
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:06,810
Wait, wait, they took over.

556
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:09,030
They took over the area.

557
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:11,150
Okay, I'll break the fence again in seven seconds.

558
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:14,970
Can't believe it.

559
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:16,290

I'm breaking.

651
00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:56,090

Everything is fine.

660
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:10,490
We gotta keep breaking their fences.

661
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:12,550
We have...

662
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:13,030

They're breaking the fences for us.

675
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:25,650
They're breaking it for us.

676
00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:27,050
They're clearing the path.

677
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:28,710

678
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:29,330
We're actually chilling.

679
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:30,790
Yeah, they cleared the path.

680
00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:31,510
They cleared the path.

681
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:32,370
We just need them to clear.

682
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:32,950
Yeah, look, look.

683
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:34,090
They're clearing the path.

684
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:35,630
We're doing good on my ping.

685
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:38,970
All right.

686
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:40,910
This is gonna be hell.

687
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:42,630
This is actually gonna be a death.

688
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:44,450
We can't use them.

689
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:45,030
I'm good.

690
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:45,410
I'm good.

691
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:46,830
All right.

692
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:48,030
We have to move up soon.

693
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:48,910
We have to put a generator.

694
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:50,170
I don't have it.

695
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:50,970
I don't have it.

696
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:51,710
I don't have it.

697
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:52,770
I already used it.

698
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:55,430
Yeah, I already used it for our other gen When did you get
it?

699
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:56,090
When did you get new one?

700
00:32:56,330 --> 00:33:01,390
Oh far We use their gens.

701
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:05,950
They have gens that we can use It'll be fine.

702
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:07,410
We use their generators.

703
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:10,270
We can't name anyone So fine.

704
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:11,130
We can't just hold the way.

705
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:12,170

I can't move my god.

755
00:34:23,170 --> 00:34:23,270
I

756
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:27,460

757
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:29,100
Oh my god.

758
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:29,880
I'm getting placement.

759
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:30,740
Oh my god.

760
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:32,820
Six.

761
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:34,400
Yeah, I could have won.

762
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,340
Who won?

763
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:37,860
Bro, what the fuck?

764
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:42,620
That was fucking insane.

765
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:45,020
Where was the crypto when we needed it?

766
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:46,660
I couldn't move.

767
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:48,020
Nobody picked crypto.

768
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:49,660
Oh shit.

769
00:34:53,220 --> 00:35:00,740
Jesus Christ Oh my god, it's actually crazy

770
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:09,440
No, I got blocked by 20 people in front of me

771
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:17,500
Nice nice that yeah, no one crypto for real no one went
crypto.

772
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:20,720
So there was just offenses everywhere Where?

773
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:23,760
Oh my, the Newcastle won!

774
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,400

00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:35,860
Oh my god, what even happened?

780
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:37,520
Yo, we left 400 bucks off that though.

781
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:38,460

782
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:39,840

Wait, wait, how much did we win?

00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:43,320
400?

786
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:44,020
Easy.

787
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:45,480
Easy.

788
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,400
Okay, now for the rest of the game, just throw it.

789
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:59,220
yeah yeah yeah now you don't have to try anymore yeah yeah

hour stream yeah yeah the one where you fucking went crazy

793
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:31,060
the longer it went and the one okay yeah the bronzer thing
the one where you just started talking to yourself at one

794
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:38,400
point because you were what when did I do that you did you
were starting to talk to yourself in that stream and I was

795
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:47,720
like this man's not okay I was 41 hours deep what he meant
you were not okay I did a 48 hour before that too and I was

796
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:55,400
talking to myself Mandy got a haircut and then I literally
saw her on stream live that day and I looked to my wall

797
00:36:55,400 --> 00:37:00,740
right I could see him I could picture like it's like you
could see him I could see him yeah he's like right next to

798
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:13,980
me type shit you mean Mandy is your fucking like sleep
paralysis demon or some shit my girlfriend is my girlfriend

799
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:25,300

the same team again spoons for real yeah oh yeah oh dang

800
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:38,780

think you got replaced with timmy that three strikes no

801
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:51,240
lifeline all right good luck i guess yeah good luck good
luck bye all right team 20 all right let me going to team 20

802
00:37:51,240 --> 00:38:05,620
now me too all right we got this that was just hello hello
hello how did your team do timmy we got 12.

803
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:15,040
whoa were you in that cluster were you um we got we were
climbing a rock and someone kamikaze me into the zone and my

804
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:23,440
face and i spawned in and i instant died i was like oh my
god okay that's good the end game you didn't want to be in

805
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:32,420
that mosh pit that shit was that mosh pit was fucked up and
never felt so useless i was like i'm used here standing with

806
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:38,820
like a bag full of nades can't even use them all the fact
that there was no crypto nobody actually picked the crypto

807
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:48,580
was very surprising at least got to play crypto everyone was
like i know the other team is gonna play crypto everyone was

808
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:59,740
like watson caustic fuse and then the of course the
newcastle team won mm-hmm that's pretty shocking wait okay

809
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:06,540
newcastle is the move yeah but and the thing is the next one
is uh three strikes and it doesn't say no newcastle just no

810
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:13,960
lifeline it also says it doesn't say no mirage why the okay
okay i was gonna say why the fuck would you play mirage but

811
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:16,780
Wait, wait, wait, I want to do Mirage.

812
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:17,740
Wait, I want to be Mirage.

813
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:18,320
Yeah, go for it.

814
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,120
Go for it.

815
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:27,020
Okay, I need people to leave Team 20 so we can join Team 20.

816
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:33,680
Um, so I also, unfortunately, cannot play Newcastle.

817
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:34,880
I could try.

818
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,840
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

819
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,760
What should we do for Compton?

820
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,100
Well, I can play Newcastle if you want to play Mirage.

821
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:42,600
I'm down for that, too.

822
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:48,400
Yeah, yeah, because I've, like, you know, you know, I played
Newcastle in Lifeline in Three Strikes because I'm that

823
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,760
fucked up as a person.

824
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:52,080
Oh, no, no, I definitely played Lifeline in Three Strikes.

825
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:53,520
Whatever it takes.

826
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:57,500
Whatever it takes to win, you know, pubs are that important
for the regular person.

827
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:58,920
We don't have much.

828
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:06,860
Yeah, honestly, I haven't played Three Strikes in a while.

829
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:13,000
So, I mean, I know that obviously the comp is Lifeline,
Newcastle.

830
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:14,960
Yeah, but we can't have Lifeline.

831
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:21,800
Yeah, so I think Newcastle, I do think people are probably
going to play Conduit as well.

832
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:22,360
Yeah, true.

833
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,240
Conduit's really good.

834
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,520
I can also play Conduit.

835
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:27,680
Yeah.

836
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:32,320
Yeah, it's probably like a Newcastle Conduit, and I don't
really know what that last one would be.

837
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:36,960
I think like Mirage, because imagine someone gets downed,
you can just crawl forever until you find your little

838
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:37,420
Mirage.

839
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:42,020
Yeah, but it doesn't matter because people don't die anyway,
so when you're down.

840
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,920
Yeah, and then you get a little stealth res off.

841
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:54,160
what i was thinking is i don't know if it actually works but
um if we play lifeline i think lifeline we can't play oh

842
00:40:54,160 --> 00:41:02,600
wait i'm sorry i'm actually i holy wait did you get sleep
did you get i'm bricked up right in my head right now jesus

843
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:12,540
christ are you okay what happened you get trauma dumped here
i got a big dent in my head right now oh

844
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,780
All right, all right, so what's... What are you cooking to
me?

845
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:20,560
What are you cooking?

846
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,660
I lost all cookage after that.

847
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:23,220
Give me a second.

848
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:29,040
Okay, after, after, like, Spoons and I was like, you know,
there's still a lifeline three times in a row.

849
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,040
You guys were saying it too many times that I thought, like,
honestly, yeah, it's been a lifeline.

850
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:36,720
Yeah, you know what?

851
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:38,240
What is Tempo gonna do?

852
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,580
Kick me out of Skrims?

853
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:41,680
He wouldn't.

854
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:44,080
Yeah, he would never do that to you.

855
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:49,760
you out of every tournament he organizes.

856
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:52,340
All right.

857
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:55,500
What...

858
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,340
I don't really know.

859
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:01,360
I'm not gonna lie, because we can play...

860
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:06,640
We could play save if you want to play save.

861
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:11,820
We could also play like somewhat aggro and such rotate, or
we could just play full aggro.

862
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:13,220
That's like kind of the three options.

863
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:17,440
Well, the thing is that Tempo set kills don't matter.

864
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:18,420
It's all about placement.

865
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:24,780
is going to be playing for placement which is why we had
like 18 squads at like round five or something last match

866
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:32,700
yeah so i think if we play too aggressively we'll just die
also there's like some fucked up teams too like there's some

867
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:42,540
like team four team four there's team four there's team four
there's team five there's i don't know how aggressive we can

868
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:53,420
play guys guys team a with omu and sniped down uh the thing
about when when i played this um and the like there's a

869
00:42:53,420 --> 00:43:00,440
journey back then is it was i think before the evo system
was changed but we pretty much want to get red armors before

870
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:06,980
we get to end game because if we we pretty much don't have
loot you know what i mean like we don't have loot and then

871
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:12,120
and then we go into the final we're most likely not going to
win so we pretty much need triple red armor or roughly

872
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:20,780
purple armors and a of meds and needs and i don't know how
much we're going to get realistically from our off drop wait

873
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:27,640
what where are we landing what's our drop point that's a
great question i think we go north pad that's okay they will

874
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:35,200
never bully you out of your drop spot you're timmy yeah yeah
right yeah they would never they see your name they're like

875
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:43,600
we can't contest them it's timmy yeah all right we're gonna
go north pad it's gonna be an edge type of um oh yeah okay

876
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:44,780
POI.

877
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,200
We should roughly get purples by the time we leave.

878
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,920
I think honestly I'm probably shouldn't have played Ray.

879
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:53,100
It would be easy.

880
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:57,580
And then just do the Newcastle and what was it?

881
00:43:58,100 --> 00:43:58,200
Conduit.

882
00:43:58,640 --> 00:43:58,980
Conduit?

883
00:43:59,140 --> 00:43:59,220
Okay.

884
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:00,940
Newcastle, Conduit.

885
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:01,380
Okay.

886
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:04,340
Because Conduit's really good for endgame when there's a lot
of teams.

887
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:06,040
So you have that Conduit ult.

888
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:07,660
Newcastle will res us.

889
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:13,660
I could port us back or port us into positions because
people are going to play zone and they're going to be like a

890
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:20,480
bunch of crazy spots so if I can just port us into a spot
and then we Newcastle Olds, we should be fine Alright,

891
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:33,080
alright I'll be Newcastle And I'm down to Conduit Cool Yeah,
look at that Look at your cooking You know, I believe in us

892
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:39,620
I see the vision Yeah, I see Timmy's vision right there
Yeah, yeah, I will let you know There is going to be a lot

893
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:50,200
of revenant conduits Running around if you see a revenant i
think it's best to us for for us to turn around but in

894
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:57,560
general it's hard to kill uh a revenant conduit anyways and
ranked but yeah i do think they're the i feel like jen

895
00:44:57,560 --> 00:45:04,240
burton is going to be on revenant and he will kill us all
it's okay that's why we have two more choices we have two

896
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:12,060
more true we have two more strikes and then we we know where
he is so we fly away from there exactly the opposite side of

897
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:23,060
the yeah yeah then we'll be fine we'll be fine we're we're
like we're peaceful um like what are they gonna do kill us

898
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:40,780
as long as one of us is standing they can't so we'll be fine
yeah there's no way in apex legends all right new castle uh

899
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:48,340
where the fuck is the hover oh we can craft oh wait we don't
we yeah no we can't craft you guys never die forever Never

900
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:49,880
mind.

901
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:53,040
You're kicking too hard.

902
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:54,460
Guys, I thought too hard.

903
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:55,480
We can play Lifeline.

904
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:56,280
Pick a Lifeline.

905
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:57,180
Yeah, we're picking Lifeline.

906
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:57,880
Go do it!

907
00:45:58,420 --> 00:45:59,500
No, but you said that.

908
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:01,520
I was actually going to be like, oh my god, it's like
Lifeline.

909
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:03,680
But it will be...

910
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:04,240
Don't worry.

911
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:08,960
Tempo likes me, so he'll restart the game for me.

912
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:10,320
Easy.

913
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:11,500
It'll be easy.

914
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:12,980
If I accidentally...

915
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:14,860
Honestly, can he just tell us the zone?

916
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:15,820
Because he can see the zone.

917
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:16,580
Oh, it's true.

918
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,200
Let me message Tempo real quick.

919
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:29,740
I'll tell him I'm never let me blackmail tempo real quick
we're jumping we might be contested oh whoa you tell him to

920
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:36,860
end right now you didn't do one point I told you you had
that much power I have that much power I told him to end the

921
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:55,460
game look at that he actually did it I did this smile I
didn't in the presence of greatness he knew i have that much

922
00:46:55,460 --> 00:47:10,480
power do we have hot drop or no uh i don't not that no no we
didn't oh wait apparently apparently reps oh wait was it

923
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:19,980
reps or oh for holes no it was for holes yeah for holes with
hot fucking lifeline oh my god that could have been that

924
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:25,000
could have been us Are we the only team that are playing?

925
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:27,020
Why are there so many caustics?

926
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:28,500
Okay, people are playing caustic.

927
00:47:28,660 --> 00:47:31,020
That makes me want to change my mind.

928
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:32,760
Do we still want conduit?

929
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:36,820
No, no, they're playing our comp.

930
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,200
They're just swapping our wraith for a caustic.

931
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:43,160
Which, honestly, I will probably just change to it.

932
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:44,840
You're going to conform?

933
00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:47,060
No, actually, now you're right.

934
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:47,920
You're going to conform?

935
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:48,740
Let those...

936
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:49,740
Actually, you're right.

937
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:50,040
You're right.

938
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:50,920
We're going to be a team.

939
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:52,100
with the right player.

940
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:52,680
Why did I almost falter?

941
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:53,600
I know.

942
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:55,760
I can't believe you're going to be a meta slave.

943
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:57,060
That's what I'm saying.

944
00:47:57,220 --> 00:47:58,260
I can't believe it.

945
00:47:58,340 --> 00:47:59,020
What happened to you?

946
00:47:59,180 --> 00:47:59,660
You've changed.

947
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:01,440
I almost changed right there.

948
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:03,760
Probably changed you.

949
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,460
The peer pressure was actually very crazy.

950
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:06,680
Probably changed you.

951
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:09,480
You wouldn't let meta help decide what you play.

952
00:48:20,450 --> 00:48:21,790
We're here to craft.

953
00:48:22,210 --> 00:48:24,690
We're here to theory craft, not be the sheep.

954
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:28,660
There were the wild cards.

955
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:29,360
We're about to win this.

956
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:29,780
Yeah, exactly.

957
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:30,920
Wild cards always win.

958
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:32,460
That's why we're wild.

959
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:36,600
Are you guys, uh, question, are you MNK or Roller?

960
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:38,100
MNK.

961
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:39,700
We're the MNK squad.

962
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:40,360
We're so fucked.

963
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:41,440
Oh, God, that's fucking good.

964
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:42,820
Wait, wait, we're fucked.

965
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:43,900
Wait, what are you talking about?

966
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:44,880
MNK is up.

967
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:46,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

968
00:48:46,940 --> 00:48:47,580
Long range.

969
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:48,380
Long range fighting.

970
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:49,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

971
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:52,860
Yeah, now we can actually use our guns, so it's fine.

972
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:53,840
It's okay.

973
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,960
I'll contact Destroyer 2009.

974
00:48:56,220 --> 00:48:57,160
We can get some aim assists.

975
00:48:57,420 --> 00:48:58,180
Oh, shit, you're right.

976
00:48:58,280 --> 00:48:58,640
You're right.

977
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:10,600
table give us walls as well with the extra 50 all right

gonna loot over here i'm like building middle here yeah just

979
00:49:18,220 --> 00:49:24,580

980
00:49:24,580 --> 00:49:29,860
get that i don't know i don't know how the respawns work but
uh there's a chance that people just don't know you're there

981
00:49:29,860 --> 00:49:39,820
and then they just land on you yeah i mean we just look up
if they yeah oh my god someone already got knocked all right

There's an evil here.

986
00:50:06,450 --> 00:50:08,190
We want to grab that.

987
00:50:08,750 --> 00:50:09,030

so there's no point in getting the second one okay yeah all
right so the stronghold right the castle wall ap right yeah

1010
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:12,700
yeah because i read it out of order so i was like And then
for your conduit one, can you read your conduit abilities?

1011
00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:19,700
Oh, I do the 10% jammer, and then I usually do the gain and
extra tackle charge instead of the range.

1012
00:52:21,620 --> 00:52:22,900
See, I'm trying to think.

1013
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:25,340
Yeah, let's see that.

1014
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:26,700
Right.

1015
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:28,860
Yeah, I'm not too sure, honestly.

1016
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:34,160
I think that one's just good because it, like you get it so
often.

1017
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:35,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1018
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:45,560
we should grab the harvesters yeah we both um we should do
the prowlers right now so we can get uh potentially close to

1019
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:51,400
purple all right let's go i'm here you

1020
00:52:58,020 --> 00:53:09,120

this one's so far away oh is the shooting the prowlers thing

1021
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:15,940
a myth or is it actually true wait a minute was that
somebody landing you back for yes you shooting it does

1022
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:21,880
actually do something okay that's not a myth it's real after
a certain amount of time you shoot it and then it's kind of

1023
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:22,560
just making noise

1024
00:53:26,140 --> 00:53:35,320
i knew it was real no it touched me i dropped a 2x if anyone
wants it i am 11.

1025
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:39,590
let's see actually i'll probably take that

1026
00:53:43,060 --> 00:53:45,080
Is there any extra light ammo?

1027
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:47,720
I can go up your stack.

1028
00:53:48,740 --> 00:53:48,880

They don't want to fly in the zone.

1069
00:55:21,740 --> 00:55:22,960
They're way too stupid for that.

1070
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:24,060
Okay.

1071
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:25,520

I should be good.

1078
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:36,820
I'm just going to grab an extra bat just in case.

1079
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:38,080
Oh, my God.

1080
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:38,820

01:03:42,700 --> 01:03:43,020

01:04:15,630 --> 01:04:16,770

Yeah, yeah.

1316
01:06:13,740 --> 01:06:16,200
They have a Cossack, they have a Cossack, so we have to
shoot the traps.

01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:16,960
All right.

01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:20,680
This is really safe.

1320
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:23,300

The windows can see you.

1329
01:06:34,540 --> 01:06:35,660
That way we're probably under the stairs.

1330
01:06:36,220 --> 01:06:36,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Not yet.

1346
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:52,600
I'm getting ticked by the caustic alt.

1347
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:53,480
Yeah, I'm dead.

1348
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:54,420
The caustic alt down to you.

1349
01:06:54,420 --> 01:06:54,720
That's okay.

1350
01:06:55,320 --> 01:06:56,840
I could just crawl up to you.

1351
01:06:56,980 --> 01:06:57,380
There's a prisoner!

1352
01:06:57,700 --> 01:06:57,940
Prisoner!

Bye-bye.

1435
01:11:30,220 --> 01:11:32,980
Alright, there's no Team 22 voice chat, so I'm waiting.

1436
01:11:33,220 --> 01:11:35,300
I can't believe the shield was me.

1437
01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:36,840
I was so confused.

1438
01:11:37,460 --> 01:11:39,300
I was just like, what do you mean?

1439
01:11:40,540 --> 01:11:46,180
I was just like, where's the conduit shield?

1440
01:11:46,660 --> 01:11:47,860
Where's the conduit?

1441
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:52,300
I was like, don't worry, guys.

1442
01:11:52,980 --> 01:11:54,320
I'm here!

1443
01:11:57,740 --> 01:11:59,480
I was so...

1444
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:02,600
I didn't realize it was...

1445
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:05,820
I didn't realize it was my shield.

1446
01:12:06,340 --> 01:12:10,660
I got confused because Conduit also uses shield.

1447
01:12:11,480 --> 01:12:12,980
The shield...

1448
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:23,940
It's just a tomato brain moment.

1449
01:12:24,620 --> 01:12:25,640
I was so...

1450
01:12:26,260 --> 01:12:29,080
Here we go, don't worry, I'm here.

1451
01:12:30,420 --> 01:12:33,840
I was like, yay, I got my all down.

1452
01:12:34,300 --> 01:12:37,060
And then I was like, all right, I did my job.

1453
01:12:40,700 --> 01:12:43,180
The shields, what do they mean?

1454
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:44,140
The shields.

1455
01:12:45,380 --> 01:12:47,360
What do the shields mean?

1456
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:53,780
That's my streamer.

1457
01:12:54,140 --> 01:12:56,020
That's my streamer.

1458
01:12:56,260 --> 01:12:57,480
That's me!

1459
01:12:59,220 --> 01:13:01,220
I'm so fucking smart.

1460
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:05,940
Alright, I need to look, read it up.

1461
01:13:06,420 --> 01:13:07,180
Read up the thing.

1462
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:08,120
What do we need?

1463
01:13:08,220 --> 01:13:09,060
Oh, we got new code.

1464
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:09,660
Okay.

1465
01:13:10,360 --> 01:13:11,180
New code time.

1466
01:13:11,980 --> 01:13:12,420
New code.

1467
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:14,980
My duo is dropped, by the way.

1468
01:13:15,340 --> 01:13:16,480
Drop would be my duo.

1469
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:19,620
Which one you two?

1470
01:13:19,980 --> 01:13:20,660
Oh, there it is.

1471
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:24,620
That's my duo.

1472
01:13:25,660 --> 01:13:38,520
I'm going to see if like any specific rules that it always
it's like a circle it's a circle oh my god he can IGL that's

1473
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:42,700
true I'm already a step up it comes full circle

1474
01:13:46,190 --> 01:13:55,390
alright let's see there's no additional rule oh Gibby Costic
only okay okay that's fine we can make this work it's only

1475
01:13:55,390 --> 01:14:04,390
Gibby and Costic it's not a circle it's a spiral it was
funny i was so i can't believe i thought it was a khanian

1476
01:14:04,390 --> 01:14:22,670
cube i can't believe it i was just like where is my cube
where is it what do you mean i was like god damn it spoons

1477
01:14:22,670 --> 01:14:25,090
where the fuck is my khanian cube

1478
01:14:28,530 --> 01:14:38,990
It's gonna haunt me for the rest of my life Hey, I still got
top five I still got top five It's still something Chat We

1479
01:14:38,990 --> 01:14:41,950
still, Q is in our heart

1480
01:14:47,150 --> 01:14:55,850
No, the thing is conduit also does shields That's why I got
confused I thought I was like That's a weird place That's I

1481
01:14:55,850 --> 01:14:59,590
was like, that's a weird plan like put down my all and then
a conic queue.

1482
01:14:59,750 --> 01:15:01,810
I was like, that's weird because he's like QQQ.

1483
01:15:01,910 --> 01:15:02,670
I was like conic queue

1484
01:15:08,470 --> 01:15:21,250
Everything was in the heat of the moment He never said which
queue yeah, that's true You know look I need my hand to be

1485
01:15:21,250 --> 01:15:22,730
held for IGLing.

1486
01:15:22,790 --> 01:15:31,110
Okay, like they have to be very fucking specific or i would
be very fucking confused for the rest of my time like i need

1487
01:15:31,110 --> 01:15:45,630
people to be extremely specific in what they mean that's why
okay guys it's not my fault chat it's not my fault they have

1488
01:15:45,630 --> 01:15:55,470
to be incredibly specific people need to like people need to
make sure they illiterate uh what is it they have i'm

1489
01:15:55,470 --> 01:16:02,710
illiterate but so but people people need to be very very
specific

look guys i'm the content creator here okay You can't assume

1492
01:16:27,010 --> 01:16:33,270
that my brain would be fine-tuned the same way as all the
other actual Apex player.

1493
01:16:34,430 --> 01:16:35,410
I'm a content creator.

1494

1557
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:31,340
I cracked Nibi.

1558
01:20:32,280 --> 01:20:33,440
No, I dropped behind you.

1559
01:20:33,560 --> 01:20:33,920
No!

1560
01:20:34,620 --> 01:20:36,240

1561
01:20:36,440 --> 01:20:37,540
I'm sorry.

1562
01:20:40,160 --> 01:20:41,860
I'm so sorry.

1563
01:20:42,720 --> 01:20:43,580
Dang, that sucks.

1564
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:46,960
So was it worth it for chicken and rice?

1565
01:20:47,500 --> 01:20:47,980
Was it...

1566
01:20:50,660 --> 01:20:51,580
Was it...

1567
01:20:51,580 --> 01:20:53,280
Was the chicken and rice worth it?

1568
01:20:53,500 --> 01:20:54,260
What is it?

1569
01:20:54,280 --> 01:20:55,020
No, no.

1570
01:21:00,640 --> 01:21:01,900
Oh, man.

1571
01:21:02,420 --> 01:21:03,600
I can't believe it.

1572
01:21:03,700 --> 01:21:07,400
My first game where I died, not top 10.

1573
01:21:08,360 --> 01:21:09,340
I'm lucky.

1574
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:11,580
GG's, though.

1575
01:21:12,260 --> 01:21:13,460
That was a...

1576
01:21:13,460 --> 01:21:15,260
I don't think that was like even...

1577
01:21:15,260 --> 01:21:16,440
That was a quick one.

1578
01:21:16,640 --> 01:21:19,440
Yeah, that wasn't even one minute.

1579
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:20,920
I don't think so.

1580
01:21:25,340 --> 01:21:28,600
Hey, at least that's $100, you know?

1581
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:37,220
that's that's one way to look at it yeah yeah it basically
paid off your chicken and rice uh-huh a lot of chicken and

1582
01:21:37,220 --> 01:21:41,340
yeah a lot of yeah yeah at least here

1583
01:21:44,760 --> 01:21:47,800
it's all right we look at the positives here

1584
01:21:50,960 --> 01:22:01,440
it's okay as long as it's more than pro league that's all
that matters you got the we got the All right, I'm gonna eat

1585
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:02,200

Good luck.

1590
01:22:09,680 --> 01:22:12,040
Guys, I don't think it's worth the chicken and rice.

1591
01:22:12,620 --> 01:22:15,360
I don't think it was worth this chicken and rice, guys.

1592
01:22:19,960 --> 01:22:23,880
I don't think the chicken and rice was worth it.

1593
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:25,900
I didn't see them, too.

1594
01:22:29,860 --> 01:22:32,640
I died so fast.

1595
01:22:33,080 --> 01:22:40,500

subs cup It's called a waifu cup.

1615
01:25:05,190 --> 01:25:06,370
That would be the only...

1616
01:25:07,690 --> 01:25:10,310
It's called a waifu cup, but it's basically a...

1617
01:25:10,310 --> 01:25:12,770
You know, like, the cup to use to put your gamer subs in.

1618
01:25:13,030 --> 01:25:14,570
Or, you know, hold water or anything.

1619
01:25:14,650 --> 01:25:16,250
It's like a Stanley cup, but better.

1620
01:25:16,650 --> 01:25:17,990
But cheaper, you know?

1621
01:25:18,470 --> 01:25:19,210
But not...

1622
01:25:19,210 --> 01:25:22,330
It's like a Stanley cup, but, like, not over...

1623
01:25:22,330 --> 01:25:23,250
What was it called?

1624
01:25:23,650 --> 01:25:24,470
Not over...

1625
01:25:26,390 --> 01:25:29,070
What's the word called when it's, like, over height?

1626
01:25:29,550 --> 01:25:30,710
What's that word called?

1627
01:25:30,990 --> 01:25:32,590
There's a specific word for it.

1628
01:25:32,590 --> 01:25:35,410
Uh, so better, yes, of course it's better.

1629
01:25:35,590 --> 01:25:37,190
It's gonna have my face on it.

1630
01:25:37,550 --> 01:25:39,630
Uh, no, no, no,

1631
01:25:43,060 --> 01:25:44,240
but for gamers.

1632
01:25:44,980 --> 01:25:46,900
Oh yeah, not overrated, exactly.

1633
01:25:47,320 --> 01:25:48,760
Goodbye Stanley Cup sponsors.

1634
01:25:49,320 --> 01:25:55,020
But if Stanley Cup wants to sponsor me as well, if Stanley
Cup wants to sponsor me as well, they're not overrated, but

1635
01:25:55,020 --> 01:25:57,520
they are currently because I'm sponsored by Gaming
Yourself's.

1636
01:25:57,860 --> 01:26:03,400
Anyway, anyway, uh, uh, uh, what was I saying?

1637
01:26:03,500 --> 01:26:09,900
Oh yeah, uh, there's gonna be There's going to be an art
contest that's going to start next week.

1638
01:26:10,600 --> 01:26:18,660
And basically, whoever wins the art contest will have their
art on my waifu cup and also win some prize money.

1639
01:26:19,700 --> 01:26:24,220
It was originally, Gamer Stubs originally sponsored 5K for
the art contest.

1640
01:26:24,640 --> 01:26:28,240
Rules will be given on April 5th on how to submit.

1641
01:26:29,240 --> 01:26:35,380
But Gamer Stubs originally, this is all paid by Gamer Stubs
by the way, they put out 5K for the art contest.

1642
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:37,680
But I wanted to choose more people.

1643
01:26:38,200 --> 01:26:41,460
So I added like 2K out of my own pocket.

1644
01:26:41,660 --> 01:26:43,460
Because I want to be able to pay for more art.

1645
01:26:43,680 --> 01:26:44,600
Like because you know guys are...

1646
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:46,380
I feel like you guys are going to submit so many beautiful
art.

1647
01:26:46,740 --> 01:26:49,880
I want to be able to compensate as many artists as I can.

1648
01:26:50,140 --> 01:26:53,320
So I decided to pay 2K out of my own pocket to add to the
prize pool.

1649
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:55,200
So it went from 5K to 7K.

1650
01:26:55,580 --> 01:26:57,500
Just so I could be able to pick more artists.

1651
01:26:57,600 --> 01:26:59,300
But only one artist will be on the cup.

1652
01:26:59,800 --> 01:27:01,760
Only one artist will be on the cup.

1653
01:27:04,500 --> 01:27:05,220
And yes.

1654
01:27:05,500 --> 01:27:08,600
So, yes, using my code helps out a lot.

1655
01:27:09,260 --> 01:27:10,060
It really does.

1656
01:27:10,160 --> 01:27:12,960
And it's on every purchase, all purchase and everything.

1657
01:27:13,300 --> 01:27:15,320
So, like, anything you want to buy, just use my code.

1658
01:27:15,740 --> 01:27:16,920
I get 10% off.

1659
01:27:18,780 --> 01:27:22,180
And Gamerselfs actually sent me, like, a package of their
stuff.

1660
01:27:22,300 --> 01:27:23,580
Like, a bunch of...

1661
01:27:23,580 --> 01:27:29,900

one.

1672
01:28:45,100 --> 01:28:46,320
The melon one's really nice.

1673
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:47,640
I really like the melon flavor.

1674
01:28:48,160 --> 01:28:51,680
And there was like one more that I also like, but I don't
remember what it was called.

1675
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:54,940
It was, uh, I think it was the peach one.

1676
01:28:55,020 --> 01:28:58,660
The melon and the peach one were, were really good.

1677
01:28:58,740 --> 01:28:59,760

She was...

1716
01:32:45,280 --> 01:32:47,680
She was like...

1717
01:32:47,680 --> 01:32:48,460

1718
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:50,120

01:32:55,680 --> 01:32:56,340
You know what?

1723
01:32:56,380 --> 01:32:56,980
I'm down.

1724
01:32:57,460 --> 01:32:58,500
Okay, to be fair.

1725
01:32:58,660 --> 01:33:02,180
First we were like, oh my god, we should do Warrior Cats.

1726
01:33:02,440 --> 01:33:10,800
Because in the past, we actually really wanted collab in the
past and do a Warrior Cats RP server on Roblox.

1727
01:33:11,100 --> 01:33:18,700
Because Warrior Cats official server, Warrior Cats has an
official Roblox server.

1728
01:33:20,200 --> 01:33:22,460
And we've always wanted to do that.

1729
01:33:22,720 --> 01:33:24,640
But we never got the perms to do it.

1730
01:33:24,940 --> 01:33:28,020
So then we were like, oh my god, is it time?

1731
01:33:28,660 --> 01:33:38,000
gonna do our warrior cats rp roblox collab and then stuffy
was like oh my god can i give you a tour on roblox but i

1732
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:45,860
can't show you like all my favorite roblox server and i was
like you know what let's give me the tour give me the tour

1733
01:33:45,860 --> 01:33:57,480
so we're gonna have a we're gonna have a roblox collab

1734
01:33:57,480 --> 01:34:02,200

1735
01:34:02,440 --> 01:34:03,740
I think okay, no, Scars Cup!

1736
01:34:03,820 --> 01:34:07,480
Sorry, Scars Cup first and then karaoke later on.

1737
01:34:07,580 --> 01:34:12,280
I think like Scars Cup is like at 2 in the morning and then
oh, okay, dude.

1738
01:34:12,620 --> 01:34:14,160
Wait, the team I spectate died.

1740
01:34:15,340 --> 01:34:16,900
I don't even remember they died.

1741
01:34:18,420 --> 01:34:27,880
Okay, anyway, anyway, after that is Scars Cup at 2 in the
morning, karaoke at 5 and then the day after that is

1742
01:34:28,660 --> 01:34:35,400

1743
01:34:39,560 --> 01:34:45,460
i i hope it's not seven hours i really hope it's not seven
hours

1744
01:34:50,520 --> 01:34:59,820
i'm just you know when tempo told me it's a seven hour long
day i thought he meant like overall He was like no, it's

1745
01:34:59,820 --> 01:35:01,080
just for one day.

1746
01:35:01,480 --> 01:35:03,220
I was like What?

1747
01:35:04,660 --> 01:35:09,260
And then Whig was like, okay, but theoretically only if we
make it to the next day.

1748
01:35:09,560 --> 01:35:13,480
So like it's all It's all about like, you know, making it to
the next day And stuff.

1749
01:35:13,740 --> 01:35:21,240

Is everything good to go?

1761
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:19,400
Wait, maybe, I'm gonna check if they announced games four

1762
01:36:19,480 --> 01:36:20,160
What is game four?

1763
01:36:20,500 --> 01:36:21,940
We had three more games.

1764
01:36:22,700 --> 01:36:24,000
Oh, 30 versus 30!

1765
01:36:24,720 --> 01:36:27,000
There's no way I can drag down my team.

1766
01:36:28,660 --> 01:36:30,080
down 29 other people.

1767
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:41,420
There's 30 versus 30 people.

1768
01:36:41,800 --> 01:36:42,240
There's Shirley.

1769
01:36:42,580 --> 01:36:43,060
Shirley.

1770
01:36:43,880 --> 01:36:48,000
I can uh oh!

1771
01:36:48,220 --> 01:36:51,340
Last week to pre-order the Lunar New Year merch!

1772
01:36:51,880 --> 01:36:52,620
By the way!

1773
01:36:52,880 --> 01:36:57,740
This is the last week to pre-order the Lunar New Year merch
chat.

1774
01:36:59,220 --> 01:37:07,860
um we have one more week left we have one more week for
lunar new year merch um people who ordered the buttons and

1775
01:37:07,860 --> 01:37:13,620
stickers might only the buttons and stickers might receive
them earlier because i actually received the stickers before

1776
01:37:13,620 --> 01:37:23,540
anything else so so you might receive your stickers um only
for people who order stickers only the only the people who

1777
01:37:23,540 --> 01:37:31,340
only order the stickers and buttons because um they
separated the delivery and i received the stickers first so

1778
01:37:31,340 --> 01:37:42,100
so the other stuff will take a while to arrive the other
stuff will still take quite a bit to arrive to us what does

1779
01:37:42,100 --> 01:37:52,440
everything else ship out uh most likely uh may may or june
most likely it's around may or june um the reason being is

1780
01:37:52,440 --> 01:37:57,200
that the products are shipped via A fucking giant boat.

1781
01:37:58,080 --> 01:38:03,520
Like, I used the ocean to ship my products because there's a
lot of them.

1782
01:38:04,360 --> 01:38:08,180
And, like, by air was really fucking expensive.

1783
01:38:08,560 --> 01:38:11,980
Like, yeah, I may receive them in, like, two to three weeks.

1784
01:38:12,420 --> 01:38:15,620
But there were a lot of them.

1785
01:38:16,140 --> 01:38:18,240
By air, it was a lot of them.

1786
01:38:18,440 --> 01:38:23,080
So, like, it was easier to just do it by cargo and by ship.

1787
01:38:24,840 --> 01:38:25,720
Wait, who won?

1788
01:38:27,420 --> 01:38:30,740
Yeah, it's gonna go, it's gonna deliver by a boat.

1789
01:38:31,200 --> 01:38:33,440
So that's why it's gonna take a bit to get here.

1790
01:38:34,200 --> 01:38:41,720
Like, it was literally, like, if I chose plain option, it
would have been like, if I chose the plain option, it would

1791
01:38:41,720 --> 01:38:44,320
have been, it would have been so fucking expensive.

1792
01:38:44,420 --> 01:38:49,640
Like, it would have been, like, half the, it would have
been, like, half the price of the merch.

1793
01:38:49,740 --> 01:38:53,620
And I was like, I was just like, what the fuck?

1794
01:38:56,780 --> 01:38:59,680
So I was like, nah, fuck that.

1795
01:39:00,380 --> 01:39:01,700
Fuck that.

1796
01:39:02,680 --> 01:39:03,880
Holy shit.

1797
01:39:04,380 --> 01:39:06,220

1798
01:39:07,760 --> 01:39:08,460

I don't want all of us in the same voice.

1853
01:45:13,680 --> 01:45:14,280
No.

1854
01:45:17,780 --> 01:45:18,040
No.

1855
01:45:23,960 --> 01:45:26,180
I'm muted myself, guys.

1856
01:45:26,540 --> 01:45:28,820
Y'all, if you're being a salt character, don't kill me.

1858
01:45:37,140 --> 01:45:46,060
we're going against controllers but okay one of us out of
the 30 of us should know where zone is right yeah yeah

1859
01:45:46,060 --> 01:45:54,680
that's the whole point if we get to the building first we
win yep i think timmy's on to something okay low key that

1860
01:45:54,680 --> 01:46:01,880
might work yo that's what i'm imagine like we all got a
maggie and we all drilling them too

1861
01:46:13,600 --> 01:46:20,180
i'm just nervous i'm just nervous for all the rollers like
don't don't shoot all i saw characters oh my amos this is

1862
01:46:20,180 --> 01:46:29,680

1863
01:46:29,680 --> 01:46:30,680
down, Simma down.

1864
01:46:32,040 --> 01:46:32,860
I'm about to see.

1865
01:46:33,020 --> 01:46:34,980
Just make sure we calm, like, really, really hard this game.

1866
01:46:35,220 --> 01:46:39,660
Should we at least have one Maggie on every team, by the
way?

1867
01:46:39,800 --> 01:46:41,140
I feel like prize and aim assist.

1868
01:46:42,440 --> 01:46:43,160
Like, imagine...

1869
01:46:43,160 --> 01:46:43,660
Maggie fuse.

1870
01:46:45,220 --> 01:46:45,800
Oh, my God.

1871
01:46:46,100 --> 01:46:47,740
I mean, I mean, if we all have...

1872
01:46:47,740 --> 01:46:53,020
If we all have Bangalore and then we have Zone, we just
Bangalore them and they can't cross.

1873
01:46:53,040 --> 01:46:58,820
And then they put Watson on the team so we can all use the
one-tone.

1874
01:46:58,840 --> 01:46:59,760
Nah, it would be fine.

1875
01:46:59,860 --> 01:47:00,920
We didn't need to pick the next time.

1876
01:47:02,040 --> 01:47:04,240
I don't need ballistics, so we just all insta-reload.

1877
01:47:05,200 --> 01:47:06,420
Does it work for everybody?

1878
01:47:07,020 --> 01:47:09,440
Bro, Noddy literally left our...

1879
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:10,680
Noddy's like...

1880
01:47:10,680 --> 01:47:13,780
Noddy's like crashing somebody else's VC.

1881
01:47:14,480 --> 01:47:16,620
He's not even in this one.

1882
01:47:16,800 --> 01:47:17,840
Bro, what the fuck?

1883
01:47:17,880 --> 01:47:19,260
I got peer pressure doing this.

1884
01:47:22,440 --> 01:47:25,780
Noddy literally fucking joined some other VC.

1885
01:47:26,100 --> 01:47:28,240
He's not even with us.

1886
01:47:28,840 --> 01:47:30,520
What the fuck is this bullshit?

1887
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:32,840
I sucked it up.

1888
01:47:39,820 --> 01:47:41,480
We have one single ass.

1889
01:47:41,700 --> 01:47:43,240
So we're drilling people now.

1890
01:47:43,820 --> 01:47:45,560
What if we have three teams?

1891
01:47:45,840 --> 01:47:50,020
Three teams are ash and then they just fucking they're like
the secret agents and shit.

1892
01:47:50,220 --> 01:47:51,280
Yeah, they're like the power rangers.

1893
01:47:52,160 --> 01:47:53,960
Who's the best rat out of all of us?

1894
01:47:54,580 --> 01:47:54,780
Me.

1895
01:47:55,280 --> 01:47:55,440
Me.

1896
01:47:58,800 --> 01:47:59,760
Is that...

1897
01:47:59,760 --> 01:48:00,920
I'm so sorry about it.

1898
01:48:01,840 --> 01:48:16,580

we're missing half like too many cooks we go mills and down

1899
01:48:16,580 --> 01:48:29,680

1900
01:48:29,680 --> 01:48:38,520

1902
01:48:47,880 --> 01:48:59,840

all in their own fucking voice chat Let's do two lightning

1903
01:48:59,840 --> 01:49:03,660
rods, two Zeus, one command, probably one storm.

1904
01:49:04,600 --> 01:49:08,460
I think one, we should go cascade balls, and then they can
go towards Jurassic.

1905
01:49:08,720 --> 01:49:15,680
We should have one, maybe one team launch pad, one team loot
the bridge up high, and then they can go pylon, and then one

1906
01:49:15,680 --> 01:49:17,140
devastate and one echo.

1907
01:49:17,660 --> 01:49:18,060
All right, good.

1908
01:49:18,260 --> 01:49:19,280
Now who's going to do any of that?

1909
01:49:19,460 --> 01:49:22,700
Wait, wait, wait, how much are we assigning this to
everybody?

1910
01:49:22,860 --> 01:49:26,120
I'm just going to say team 14 will take storm catcher
because that's our team.

1911
01:49:28,260 --> 01:49:39,000
to do minus just said team 11 to 20 left side of map oh what
left side of map see our plan i think for voice call as well

1912
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:45,940
though should we have like two teams per voice call so we
don't clutter everyone no uh like or you want to just like

1913
01:49:45,940 --> 01:49:53,660
like all do our comms in here it's just we don't have to
like just ping in game don't yeah i mean like i don't know i

1914
01:49:53,660 --> 01:49:56,740
wouldn't want to come in here Oh, light mag, like 50 of us
saying it.

1915
01:49:57,380 --> 01:49:58,180
Yeah, I know.

1916
01:49:58,320 --> 01:50:02,260
It's pretty much the same resume or push this guy at the
building.

1917
01:50:02,400 --> 01:50:02,900
That is lean.

1918
01:50:03,440 --> 01:50:05,980
Like, initially, just point at your monitor.

1919
01:50:07,240 --> 01:50:08,780
Point at your monitor.

1920
01:50:09,140 --> 01:50:10,360
Point at your monitor.

1921
01:50:10,580 --> 01:50:11,520
Just point them out.

1922
01:50:11,560 --> 01:50:11,980
Don't cross.

1923
01:50:13,100 --> 01:50:14,320
I think I didn't initially call it.

1924
01:50:14,600 --> 01:50:15,440
I didn't left side or right side.

1925
01:50:16,580 --> 01:50:17,880
Because then you will finish them, please.

1926
01:50:20,160 --> 01:50:20,600
Holy crap.

1927
01:50:21,120 --> 01:50:21,600
We're right side.

1928
01:50:21,800 --> 01:50:22,320
Can this work?

1929
01:50:22,680 --> 01:50:24,340
I'm writing something for you guys.

1930
01:50:25,100 --> 01:50:34,420
what if i just join the other voice chat nice oh bet so i'll
go on launchpad perfect all i need to know yeah that's fine

1931
01:50:34,420 --> 01:50:43,820
perfect not delete it so they don't find they don't get the
strategy there's no uh there's no command on that list so

1932
01:50:43,820 --> 01:50:49,460
could have team 11 that's so helpful sure and then pylons 11
command yeah

1933
01:50:54,740 --> 01:50:56,700
Let's see how many cars are there.

1934
01:50:57,120 --> 01:50:58,120
Bang Fuse and Maggie, right?

1935
01:50:58,840 --> 01:50:59,800
Where do we all want to meet up?

1936
01:51:00,600 --> 01:51:01,440
Big Fuse, Maggie, okay.

1937
01:51:02,260 --> 01:51:04,140
Oh, this is no name.

1938
01:51:04,780 --> 01:51:05,220
Wait, wait, wait.

1939
01:51:05,400 --> 01:51:06,260
This is so chaotic.

1940
01:51:06,720 --> 01:51:09,080
We should most likely group up at...

1941
01:51:09,080 --> 01:51:10,880
Drop, can you start doing some IGL calls?

1942
01:51:10,960 --> 01:51:12,880
Bro, you want me to fucking pipe up?

1943
01:51:13,520 --> 01:51:14,340
A pipe up.

1944
01:51:15,940 --> 01:51:17,560
Big, mad Maggie, Fuse.

1945
01:51:17,560 --> 01:51:19,140
We need to divvy up where people are going.

1946
01:51:19,960 --> 01:51:20,200
We have it.

1947
01:51:20,560 --> 01:51:21,580
That's already in there.

1948
01:51:22,660 --> 01:51:24,080
IGL isn't even with us!

1949
01:51:24,740 --> 01:51:32,220
paying attention we need a new commander i think our
commander is lost already our pro player actually isn't even

1950
01:51:32,220 --> 01:51:41,120
i'm down for 10 years he left us with the other controller
pros i changed 11 to 12 for command because pylon's not in

1951
01:51:41,120 --> 01:51:49,400
that's no man's land joined the controller pro side so one
one time where are we all landing look at turn in the chat

1952
01:51:49,400 --> 01:51:52,500
make sure you pick your characters.

1953
01:51:52,600 --> 01:51:53,380
What's not okay?

1954
01:51:53,900 --> 01:51:56,200
I guess I'll do manbaggy.

1955
01:51:56,260 --> 01:51:57,360
I'm literally in the lobby.

1956
01:51:57,700 --> 01:51:58,280
I'm looking at the lobby.

1957
01:51:58,460 --> 01:51:58,820
I did it.

1958
01:51:59,320 --> 01:52:02,040
Oh, that's someone already DC'd.

1959
01:52:02,080 --> 01:52:02,820
I might have to restart.

1960
01:52:03,220 --> 01:52:03,780
Yeah, tell them.

1961
01:52:06,260 --> 01:52:07,620
Wait, who's too loud?

1962
01:52:07,780 --> 01:52:09,160
I don't even know who's too loud.

1963
01:52:09,360 --> 01:52:10,520
There's 30 people.

1964
01:52:10,540 --> 01:52:11,220
They're going to restart.

1965
01:52:11,380 --> 01:52:12,000
They're probably restart.

1966
01:52:14,020 --> 01:52:15,420
Okay, I turned it down.

1967
01:52:15,620 --> 01:52:18,380
Guys, the thing is, I don't even know who's too loud.

1968
01:52:18,620 --> 01:52:20,460
There's 30 people in here.

1969
01:52:20,740 --> 01:52:42,920
I can't even town they're not restarting not restarting oh
yeah guys you know this this server definitely does not have

1970
01:52:42,920 --> 01:52:50,500
any boost right now that's not having a pylon right like
once he's put start oh yeah we all need that pylon yeah once

1971
01:52:50,500 --> 01:52:56,560
he typed start no i don't think everyone but i feel like the
bottom side of the map teams should all move there and then

1972
01:52:56,560 --> 01:53:01,460
group up and then we need to like group up i mean we're we
don't know where the zone's going to be right because

1973
01:53:01,460 --> 01:53:10,260
there's going to be zones like you can tell the server is
boostless i say we wait it's so crunchy yeah i mean i think

1974
01:53:10,260 --> 01:53:16,060
in general we should probably just group up or like half
those cascades half those pylon and then we can just kind of

1975
01:53:16,060 --> 01:53:23,140
meet we also we're all going zeus by the way we also have
dogs on that north side that is available so one of you guys

1976
01:53:23,140 --> 01:53:30,960
should do that too oh yeah that's all available to us yeah
yeah you think i'm breaking the rules from standing outside

1977
01:53:30,960 --> 01:53:34,480
the line to command i hit that spider in the line

1978
01:53:38,880 --> 01:53:47,400
yeah make the spiders come to you i feel like we need a hard
real height like on everything i do want to also point out

1979
01:53:47,400 --> 01:53:54,480
we probably should have roughly peter 30 30 snipers they
have ramp walls so we do need to break those they're gonna

1980
01:53:54,480 --> 01:54:02,900
have rampart walls okay what the fuck why did they get the
good side spamming not the closest at the rampart walls i'm

1981
01:54:02,900 --> 01:54:12,320
saying because if smokes why did people just shoot the wall
as they're replacing it it's not fair once you die oh no

1982
01:54:12,320 --> 01:54:20,920
people dc'd what do you yeah people dc'd again oh wait
there's like 10 dc they're gonna restart the lobby again oh

We have to go.

2067
02:01:46,200 --> 02:01:48,000
probably just in the onsad right now.

2068
02:01:48,660 --> 02:01:49,380
I'll jive, I'll jive.

2069
02:01:49,720 --> 02:01:51,280
I'm about to go all the way up toward the wall.

02:01:52,780 --> 02:01:54,200
IGL's, where do you want us to go?

2071
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:56,360
IGL's.

2072
02:01:58,440 --> 02:02:01,160
Yeah, where should we meet?

2073
02:02:01,740 --> 02:02:03,020
I mean, we can think about where we should meet.

2074
02:02:03,320 --> 02:02:04,340
We should meet Cascades.

2075
02:02:05,480 --> 02:02:05,840
Cascades.

2076
02:02:06,180 --> 02:02:07,000
Yeah, I'm down.

2077
02:02:07,720 --> 02:02:09,460
Yeah, we need to get our harvesters, but fuck.

2078
02:02:09,740 --> 02:02:10,960
Yeah, we need to all get our armors up.

2079
02:02:12,720 --> 02:02:14,680
I'm gonna do those command sweaters.

2080
02:02:14,680 --> 02:02:18,300
You guys have to like split up, split up and like send each
guy like different harvesters.

2081
02:02:18,600 --> 02:02:18,860
Yeah.

2082
02:02:19,820 --> 02:02:21,100
Where's Naughty going?

2083
02:02:21,380 --> 02:02:22,640
Where's Naughty going?

2084
02:02:25,220 --> 02:02:28,320
It's a unit, the ITL unit.

2085
02:02:28,920 --> 02:02:31,000
They're gonna be sitting behind walls for sure.

2086
02:02:31,960 --> 02:02:32,220
Hmm.

2087
02:02:33,040 --> 02:02:35,340
I don't want to get triple shot on.

2088
02:02:36,460 --> 02:02:38,960
Do we think banks should take ultimate cooldown or tap
cooldown?

2089
02:02:39,140 --> 02:02:40,560
I think ult would go crazy right now.

2090
02:02:40,740 --> 02:02:41,620
Alt cooldown, yeah.

2091
02:02:41,640 --> 02:02:44,880
That's our teammate, right?

2092
02:02:45,040 --> 02:02:46,080
Yeah, they're on our side.

2093
02:02:46,420 --> 02:02:47,920
But if you die, you back from up here.

2094
02:02:48,160 --> 02:02:50,320
Probably mute so the people alive won't get confused.

2095
02:02:50,520 --> 02:02:51,100
Oh, it's ain't good.

2096
02:02:51,680 --> 02:02:52,360
Makes sense.

2097
02:02:53,240 --> 02:02:55,440
You should just stop calling out while you're down.

2098
02:02:57,040 --> 02:02:58,280
Just rage really hard.

2099
02:02:58,760 --> 02:02:59,720
Screaming you're holding knockdown.

2100
02:03:00,280 --> 02:03:05,100
Guys, I could have put the descript list of all the people
that's in our voice.

2101
02:03:05,260 --> 02:03:06,180
Wait, wait, wait, wait, what the?

2102
02:03:06,560 --> 02:03:07,880

farm armors off them can we how does this round work we have

2104
02:03:23,180 --> 02:03:28,320

2105
02:03:33,500 --> 02:03:38,440
but then we're just we're gonna lose our shields It's bro.

2106

They're completely just dumb.

2110
02:03:46,800 --> 02:03:47,480
That would think about it.

2111
02:03:47,480 --> 02:03:47,800
What do we want?

2112
02:03:47,940 --> 02:03:49,280

02:05:19,270 --> 02:05:23,190
We should have had the one, the map would have no zones.

2143
02:05:23,590 --> 02:05:29,210
In my opinion, we should honestly start grouping now and go
kill them because they are 100% running around the map

2144
02:05:29,210 --> 02:05:30,230
trying to get their evas up.

2145
02:05:30,830 --> 02:05:32,770
Like we should like try to pick them because I...

2146
02:05:32,770 --> 02:05:33,130
We're trying to regroup.

2147
02:05:33,250 --> 02:05:34,490
What spot are we regrouping at?

2148
02:05:34,510 --> 02:05:35,170
Barrow, you think?

2149
02:05:35,450 --> 02:05:37,830
I mean, I just saw two of them just waste evac.

2150
02:05:38,070 --> 02:05:38,690
So they're coming.

2151
02:05:38,810 --> 02:05:40,090
We should go to mill right now.

2152
02:05:40,130 --> 02:05:41,730
We should all go towards mill and try to kill people.

2153
02:05:41,750 --> 02:05:48,130
mill okay okay for the mill so far give us time though

That's us.

2164
02:07:25,330 --> 02:07:25,910
We're shooting spiders.

2165
02:07:26,330 --> 02:07:26,970
Where's Naughty?

2166
02:07:26,970 --> 02:07:27,610
Do spiders here.

2167
02:07:27,790 --> 02:07:28,210

2169
02:07:30,590 --> 02:07:30,830
I see that.

2170
02:07:30,830 --> 02:07:31,630
I see him on that Godwaker now.

2171
02:07:32,190 --> 02:07:34,330
Where's my, oh Naughty's behind us.

2172
02:07:36,710 --> 02:07:37,550
They're over there.

2173
02:07:37,730 --> 02:07:38,370
This is a bad zone.

2174
02:07:38,530 --> 02:07:39,390
We can't use any Bengals.

2175
02:07:39,810 --> 02:07:40,290
Wait a minute.

2176
02:07:40,550 --> 02:07:40,970
They're there.

2177
02:07:41,450 --> 02:07:42,330
We go Seenote then, right?

2178
02:07:42,410 --> 02:07:43,750
No one's guarding the left side of Seenote right here.

2179
02:07:43,870 --> 02:07:45,250
Like the far left side entrance of Seenote.

2180
02:07:45,390 --> 02:07:45,530
All right.

2181
02:07:45,670 --> 02:07:46,490
We're going to go.

2182
02:07:47,270 --> 02:07:47,370
Yeah, we're going to go.

2183
02:07:47,370 --> 02:07:48,490
We should probably group up now.

2184
02:07:48,550 --> 02:07:48,750
Yeah.

2185
02:07:49,230 --> 02:07:49,410
Yeah.

2186
02:07:50,470 --> 02:07:51,190
Towards Barrow.

2187
02:07:51,530 --> 02:07:51,590
Okay.

2188
02:07:51,610 --> 02:07:52,450
Go Bean.

2189
02:07:52,690 --> 02:07:53,030
Go Bean.

2190
02:07:54,490 --> 02:07:54,990
Go Bean.

2191
02:07:55,210 --> 02:07:55,370
Yeah.

2192
02:07:55,710 --> 02:07:59,370
I have a two by four.

2193
02:07:59,690 --> 02:08:00,090
Yeah, let's do it.

2194
02:08:00,410 --> 02:08:01,770
Where are you going, Nuddy?

2195
02:08:01,990 --> 02:08:03,810
We probably need to wait for a bunch of people too.

2196
02:08:04,470 --> 02:08:04,710
Right here.

2197
02:08:04,810 --> 02:08:05,550
There's only no one here.

2198
02:08:05,650 --> 02:08:06,690
There's no one holding the side.

2199
02:08:06,710 --> 02:08:07,990
Yeah, let's do it.

2200
02:08:07,990 --> 02:08:08,370
Let's do it.

2201
02:08:08,370 --> 02:08:09,430
Which side are you talking about?

2202
02:08:10,650 --> 02:08:12,790
Oh, he's getting the armor.

2203
02:08:12,990 --> 02:08:13,810
He's getting the armor.

2204
02:08:14,990 --> 02:08:15,930
Left side of Sino.

2205
02:08:18,850 --> 02:08:20,950
I don't want to be like...

2206
02:08:20,950 --> 02:08:22,690
Get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in.

2207
02:08:22,690 --> 02:08:23,570
Get in the hill.

2208
02:08:24,810 --> 02:08:25,550
Oh, they might be there.

2209
02:08:26,630 --> 02:08:29,110
Is that them?

2210
02:08:29,510 --> 02:08:30,330
Yeah, yeah, that's him.

2211
02:08:31,210 --> 02:08:32,110
I'm in Sanote now.

2212
02:08:32,210 --> 02:08:32,510
I'm in Sanote.

2213
02:08:32,770 --> 02:08:33,730
Yeah, we're moving up.

2214
02:08:33,950 --> 02:08:34,710
There's nobody close buildings.

2215
02:08:34,850 --> 02:08:35,750
Nobody close to Sanote buildings.

2216
02:08:35,890 --> 02:08:36,430
Nice, nice.

2217
02:08:36,710 --> 02:08:37,510
So you guys are at Mills?

2218
02:08:37,650 --> 02:08:38,270
You're good at Mills?

2219
02:08:38,890 --> 02:08:39,410
We're good at Mills.

2220
02:08:39,550 --> 02:08:40,570
We're going Bean right now.

2221
02:08:40,730 --> 02:08:41,550
Okay, we're following.

2222
02:08:41,710 --> 02:08:41,750
Yep.

2223
02:08:42,010 --> 02:08:42,470
And we're moving.

2224
02:08:43,630 --> 02:08:44,510
We're moving into Sino.

2225
02:08:44,790 --> 02:08:45,350
I'm waiting for you guys.

2226
02:08:46,330 --> 02:08:48,670
We should probably just group up here and wait for everyone
before .

2227
02:08:48,670 --> 02:08:49,170
On the main hill.

2228
02:08:50,410 --> 02:08:50,550
Yeah.

2229
02:08:51,530 --> 02:08:53,570
Will you allow them to take care packs then?

2230
02:08:53,970 --> 02:08:54,650
Yeah, I'll stay.

2231
02:08:54,730 --> 02:08:55,550
I'm so scared.

2232
02:08:56,270 --> 02:08:57,430
I don't see anybody.

2233
02:08:57,670 --> 02:08:58,690
I'm so scared.

2234
02:08:58,890 --> 02:09:00,230
Oh, I see them!

2235
02:09:01,430 --> 02:09:03,170
Look at their fucking shims!

2236
02:09:04,510 --> 02:09:05,150
Going for care pack.

2237
02:09:05,290 --> 02:09:05,950
Going for care pack.

2238
02:09:06,110 --> 02:09:06,530
Go for the care pack.

2239
02:09:06,710 --> 02:09:09,110
Oh my god, do you see that?

2240
02:09:11,630 --> 02:09:13,230
Oh my god.

2241
02:09:13,230 --> 02:09:14,930
Oh my god.

2242
02:09:15,610 --> 02:09:16,150
Oh my god.

2243
02:09:16,150 --> 02:09:16,490
What the?

2244
02:09:17,410 --> 02:09:19,130
This is not fair.

2245
02:09:20,170 --> 02:09:22,330
What the fuck?

2246
02:09:22,330 --> 02:09:23,010
Oh my god.

2247
02:09:24,230 --> 02:09:26,130
What the fuck?

2248
02:09:26,390 --> 02:09:28,370
What the fuck am I looking at?

2249
02:09:28,550 --> 02:09:31,030
You should stick with your teammates, by the way.

2250
02:09:31,470 --> 02:09:32,450
Holy shit.

2251
02:09:34,210 --> 02:09:36,690
Dude, they're literally just sitting on top of those rocks.

2252
02:09:36,710 --> 02:09:37,310
I'm sad.

2253
02:09:38,030 --> 02:09:39,830
Bro, I would be on THAT team!

2254
02:09:40,850 --> 02:09:41,770
They're gonna have console.

2255
02:09:41,890 --> 02:09:42,710
They're gonna have console, bro.

2256
02:09:43,070 --> 02:09:43,510
Bro!

2257
02:09:43,730 --> 02:09:46,550
They have a console in there, too.

2258
02:09:46,550 --> 02:09:47,750
I would be on that team!

2259
02:09:48,590 --> 02:09:52,250
Yeah, I believe in this zone.

2260
02:09:52,670 --> 02:09:53,670
Yeah, we need to talk...

2261
02:09:53,670 --> 02:09:56,370
They made it new POI.

2262
02:09:56,370 --> 02:09:56,670
They're gonna be careful.

2263
02:09:57,310 --> 02:09:58,710
They're gonna have Watsongens and stuff.

2264
02:09:59,210 --> 02:10:00,790
Yeah, that actually is very true.

2265
02:10:00,950 --> 02:10:01,530
Oh my god.

2266
02:10:02,250 --> 02:10:03,950
You said backside, south side of Cino.

2267
02:10:04,150 --> 02:10:05,390
Yeah, it just ends on them, bro.

2268
02:10:05,410 --> 02:10:05,930
All Cino's open.

2269
02:10:06,110 --> 02:10:06,690
All Cino's open.

2270
02:10:07,830 --> 02:10:10,190
Okay, it might be the one in the far back by the way.

2271
02:10:10,210 --> 02:10:11,650
It's like car losses here.

2272
02:10:11,730 --> 02:10:13,370
Yeah Yeah

2273
02:10:24,530 --> 02:10:33,150
Yeah, can we can we fight left building the far left

02:10:39,490 --> 02:10:39,810
building.

2276
02:10:39,910 --> 02:10:41,150
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you should do that.

2277
02:10:41,330 --> 02:10:41,410
You should do that.

2278
02:10:42,710 --> 02:10:43,510
Give me a smug to run into.

2279
02:10:43,750 --> 02:10:44,090
Yeah, yeah.

2280
02:10:44,090 --> 02:10:44,730
That's actually crazy.

2281
02:10:47,950 --> 02:10:49,290
You're ready to take the ash, you boys.

2282
02:10:49,530 --> 02:10:50,090
They have the hole.

2283
02:10:51,090 --> 02:10:51,210
Yep.

2284
02:10:52,230 --> 02:10:54,330
Oh, I'm lagging in the server.

2285
02:10:55,750 --> 02:10:56,110
Yeah.

2286
02:10:56,870 --> 02:10:57,650
Wait, I got knocked.

2287
02:10:58,470 --> 02:10:58,830
Tifa.

2288
02:10:59,610 --> 02:10:59,730
Yeah.

2289
02:10:59,950 --> 02:11:00,610
I got full knocked.

2290
02:11:00,930 --> 02:11:01,630
Wait, careful guys.

2291
02:11:01,750 --> 02:11:02,290
You might be shooting.

2292
02:11:02,410 --> 02:11:03,150
What's in one HP inside?

2293
02:11:03,570 --> 02:11:04,230
The rev is one shot.

2294
02:11:04,410 --> 02:11:04,770
Oh, no.

2295
02:11:05,410 --> 02:11:05,770
120.

2296
02:11:06,950 --> 02:11:08,590
I'm breaking the down.

2297
02:11:09,030 --> 02:11:09,330
Breaking the jam.

2298
02:11:10,270 --> 02:11:11,590
I don't know what's going on.

2299
02:11:11,710 --> 02:11:13,070
I'm following the crowd.

2300
02:11:13,370 --> 02:11:13,830
I knocked one.

2301
02:11:14,490 --> 02:11:15,430
Can't one not to kill each other.

2302
02:11:15,710 --> 02:11:20,310
I can't tell.

2303
02:11:21,270 --> 02:11:21,770
I can't.

2304
02:11:21,970 --> 02:11:23,030
There's so many.

2305
02:11:23,390 --> 02:11:23,910
Don't bang all.

2306
02:11:23,950 --> 02:11:24,590
Do not bang all.

2307
02:11:24,650 --> 02:11:26,790
We're going to kill each other.

2308
02:11:26,870 --> 02:11:27,230
I'm on roof.

2309
02:11:27,370 --> 02:11:27,670
I'm on roof.

2310
02:11:29,510 --> 02:11:30,390
I'm just...

2311
02:11:31,590 --> 02:11:32,590
Oh my god!

2312
02:11:32,750 --> 02:11:33,870
We're going in!

2313
02:11:35,030 --> 02:11:35,910
I can't...

2314
02:11:36,710 --> 02:11:37,950
We need to get inside the building if you can.

2315
02:11:38,190 --> 02:11:39,270
Okay, take in the building.

2316
02:11:39,810 --> 02:11:40,710
Oh, my, my, my, my, my.

2317
02:11:41,010 --> 02:11:41,690
I got to the desk.

2318
02:11:42,210 --> 02:11:43,590
Okay, I'm inside, I'm safe.

2319
02:11:43,770 --> 02:11:45,070
I'll bring an ulti out of this bag all.

2320
02:11:45,370 --> 02:11:46,150
What is this?

2321
02:11:46,310 --> 02:11:47,630
What is going on?

2322
02:11:47,870 --> 02:11:48,490
A storm?

2323
02:11:49,150 --> 02:11:50,770
I think I'm dead, I'm dead.

2324
02:11:51,490 --> 02:11:52,570
Deeds, you can rest, Deeds.

2325
02:11:53,070 --> 02:11:53,790
I'm coming.

2326
02:11:55,290 --> 02:11:56,250
I'm knocked, I'm knocked.

2327
02:11:56,410 --> 02:11:56,870
Fuck, I'm dead.

2328
02:11:57,350 --> 02:11:58,350
I might try to rest you, Mario.

2329
02:11:58,530 --> 02:12:01,430
I try to take the zip behind you guys and they just try to
look at me right here.

2330
02:12:02,450 --> 02:12:03,690
They're all trying to fucking push up.

2331
02:12:04,390 --> 02:12:05,110
Oh my God.

2332
02:12:05,130 --> 02:12:06,470
Are we in the building or?

2333
02:12:06,710 --> 02:12:07,230
I can't see.

2334
02:12:07,510 --> 02:12:09,410
I don't know who's my teammate.

2335
02:12:11,750 --> 02:12:13,410
I literally can't see.

2336
02:12:14,010 --> 02:12:15,450
Oh wait, it's almost finishing.

2337
02:12:15,890 --> 02:12:17,070
I have a respawn beacon.

2338
02:12:17,190 --> 02:12:17,830
I'm gonna put it right here.

2339
02:12:18,070 --> 02:12:18,730
Bring around your teammates.

2340
02:12:19,290 --> 02:12:20,350
Is that the enemy?

2341
02:12:20,550 --> 02:12:21,190
I can't tell.

2342
02:12:21,990 --> 02:12:23,050
I actually can't tell.

2343
02:12:23,670 --> 02:12:25,850
Oh, fuck, okay.

2344
02:12:26,390 --> 02:12:28,450
There's too many people.

2345
02:12:30,250 --> 02:12:31,490
Let me know.

2346
02:12:31,670 --> 02:12:32,270
I need a run.

2347
02:12:32,390 --> 02:12:33,450
Oh, shit.

2348
02:12:33,770 --> 02:12:35,250
I stormed the beam.

2349
02:12:35,390 --> 02:12:36,310
I can grab you.

2350
02:12:37,710 --> 02:12:38,350
Like water.

2351
02:12:43,290 --> 02:12:44,410
It's okay, good try, good try.

2352
02:12:44,850 --> 02:12:46,350
We're still in, we're still inside the building.

2353
02:12:46,690 --> 02:12:48,830
Oh, I'm dead.

2354
02:12:48,950 --> 02:12:49,970
Oh my god, this is water.

2355
02:12:50,530 --> 02:12:50,890
Are you good?

2356
02:12:51,130 --> 02:12:51,730
I'm good.

2357
02:12:53,050 --> 02:12:54,530
Yes, yes, the building is still in.

2358
02:12:54,690 --> 02:12:54,930
I'm going.

2359
02:12:55,990 --> 02:12:58,850
We need to get inside.

2360
02:12:59,050 --> 02:12:59,810
I think we need to get inside.

2361
02:12:59,950 --> 02:13:00,950
Can we try to- Yeah, we do.

2362
02:13:00,950 --> 02:13:01,830
We need to get inside.

2363
02:13:02,250 --> 02:13:04,030
Some of them have blue armors in the building on the left.

2364
02:13:07,130 --> 02:13:13,450
in which building are we drilling they're all they're

I just spawned in.

2369
02:13:41,230 --> 02:13:41,850
I don't know, I don't know.

2370
02:13:42,310 --> 02:13:43,630
You guys need to smoke the zip.

2371
02:13:43,810 --> 02:13:45,150
You guys need to smoke the zip if you can.

2372
02:13:45,650 --> 02:13:47,710
Someone smoked the cross so I can mess with your teammate.

2373
02:13:48,870 --> 02:13:51,310
There's so many things going on!

2374
02:13:51,690 --> 02:13:56,170
You guys, if you're gonna do it, you have to try right now.

2375
02:13:56,230 --> 02:13:56,950
With the Maggie ball.

2376
02:13:57,450 --> 02:13:57,470

2377
02:13:58,330 --> 02:13:58,730

2378
02:13:58,730 --> 02:13:58,970

2379

The fucking gas!

2380
02:14:00,490 --> 02:14:01,730
I couldn't tell which one.

2381
02:14:02,010 --> 02:14:04,030
I already used it.

2382
02:14:04,310 --> 02:14:06,610
Guys, naughty, naughty, naughty, you're so fucked.

2383
02:14:06,710 --> 02:14:08,990

There's so many armor swaps, there's no way.

2386
02:14:16,230 --> 02:14:17,650
I have no more shoes.

2387
02:14:19,250 --> 02:14:19,810
Yeah,

2388
02:14:24,550 --> 02:14:26,890

02:14:30,430 --> 02:14:34,650
Nadi, I'm literally, I know you're confused, but I'm
literally your teammate, Nadi.

2391
02:14:34,890 --> 02:14:36,550
Nadi, I'm literally your teammate.

2392
02:14:36,710 --> 02:14:38,290
Nadi, Riz!

2393
02:14:40,170 --> 02:14:42,490
Nadi, I'm literally your teammate, Nadi!

2394
02:14:43,050 --> 02:14:47,470
I know you're confused because there's so many people, but
I'm literally your teammate!

2395
02:14:51,270 --> 02:14:52,910
I'm sorry, Nadi.

2396
02:14:55,370 --> 02:14:57,430
I'm back here inside of Sino with you guys.

2397
02:14:57,510 --> 02:14:58,190
You guys got any meds?

2398
02:14:58,310 --> 02:14:58,630
I'm pretty low.

2399
02:14:59,550 --> 02:15:02,710
Of course the moment he Riz is...

2400
02:15:07,710 --> 02:15:13,430
Bro, bro, bro, this is like the most unfair game

2401
02:15:16,990 --> 02:15:37,150
Oh my god This is actually the most unfair game ever To me
Oh my god He hesitated I was so free to rest for the longest

2402
02:15:37,150 --> 02:15:37,810
time.

2403
02:15:38,250 --> 02:15:44,830
This is actually Oh, I can't believe we actually had to run
the beach.

2404
02:15:45,070 --> 02:15:47,290
I can't believe we actually had to do that.

2405
02:15:47,630 --> 02:15:49,150
We had to storm the beach.

2406
02:15:49,510 --> 02:15:52,850
That's actually crazy that that happened.

2407
02:15:56,230 --> 02:16:00,350
That was actually fucking crazy.

2408
02:16:01,310 --> 02:16:09,850
Like, but like it was the most unfair to us because we had
to run to the beach we were with a team that had to run

2409
02:16:09,850 --> 02:16:27,950
across the beach against defense like what the fuck there
really is a war war never changes bro there's no way that

2410
02:16:27,950 --> 02:16:35,630
we're our team's still alive there's no fucking I don't
think I don't think I There's no way the assault characters

2411
02:16:35,630 --> 02:16:36,390
are alive.

2412
02:16:36,570 --> 02:16:37,730
There's no fucking way.

2413
02:16:37,810 --> 02:16:42,370
I think we're all dead I legitimately think we're all dead

2414
02:16:47,510 --> 02:17:02,090
War it never changes it really does War is not fair toky bro
look at how many of the defenders they're still alive like

2415
02:17:02,090 --> 02:17:04,650
they all Only lost five people!

2416
02:17:05,450 --> 02:17:06,910
Oh my god!

2417
02:17:10,790 --> 02:17:14,390
That's only five people died.

2418
02:17:15,570 --> 02:17:17,650
That's actually crazy!

2419
02:17:18,170 --> 02:17:19,970
That's actually crazy!

2420
02:17:21,390 --> 02:17:24,670
This is 100% defense-sided.

2421
02:17:24,810 --> 02:17:27,070
I lost the 50-50 chat.

2422
02:17:27,530 --> 02:17:31,090
I lost the lottery to be on team defense.

2423
02:17:31,670 --> 02:17:32,270
I...

2424
02:17:32,510 --> 02:17:35,110
This is what Normandy feels like.

2425
02:17:39,810 --> 02:17:40,410
Oh my god.

2426
02:17:40,730 --> 02:17:43,110
They got the fucking...

2427
02:17:43,110 --> 02:17:44,090
They got the map.

2428
02:17:44,270 --> 02:17:45,290
They got the zone.

2429
02:17:45,970 --> 02:17:47,870
And they also got like...

2430
02:17:47,870 --> 02:17:49,990
They got the zone as defenders.

2431
02:17:51,310 --> 02:17:52,870
I think that's the worst part.

2432
02:17:53,070 --> 02:17:54,850
If they were playing the same...

2433
02:17:56,350 --> 02:17:58,770
I think if they were playing the same...

2434
02:17:58,770 --> 02:18:01,830
If they were on assault characters, I think it would be more
fair.

2435
02:18:02,510 --> 02:18:12,690
fact that like they got the controller class and zone that
was that was fucked up man that was so fucked up they

2436
02:18:12,690 --> 02:18:19,230
actually won the gotcha yeah they got the best possible zone
for this fight

2437
02:18:23,570 --> 02:18:33,310
holy shit that's so funny that's actually so funny i can't
believe we have to run at the beach.

2438
02:18:33,590 --> 02:18:35,150
I can't believe that.

2439
02:18:36,410 --> 02:18:37,870
Oh my god.

2440
02:18:42,230 --> 02:18:46,110
I can't believe we had to run at the beach.

2441
02:18:47,450 --> 02:18:48,590
It's so poetic.

2442
02:18:49,010 --> 02:18:50,330
It actually is.

2443
02:18:53,790 --> 02:18:58,170
The thing is, I was so confused because I was worried I was
going to shoot my old teammates.

2444
02:18:58,830 --> 02:19:00,310
That was the worst part.

2445
02:19:00,650 --> 02:19:08,330
I was just like, who's my teammate it doesn't matter when
you're in a fight there's so many people around me I

2446
02:19:08,330 --> 02:19:16,510
couldn't tell and then we couldn't use Bangalore alt because
we can alt ourselves so it was like we couldn't use

2447
02:19:16,510 --> 02:19:27,750
Bangalore alt because we didn't want to kill ourselves with
Bangalore alt it's actually crazy

2448
02:19:32,510 --> 02:19:34,690
Oh my god, they're fighting each other.

2449
02:19:34,910 --> 02:19:35,830
We're fisting again.

2450
02:19:36,770 --> 02:19:38,550
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

2451
02:19:39,230 --> 02:19:41,010
It's back to fisting.

2452
02:19:42,810 --> 02:19:43,950
Oh my god.

2453
02:19:44,030 --> 02:19:46,710
I like how we had, like, no man's land.

2454
02:19:47,090 --> 02:19:48,790
We established no man's land.

2455
02:19:48,990 --> 02:19:50,950
We're like, oh, you can't cross no man's land.

2456
02:19:51,250 --> 02:19:54,130
But it didn't matter because the zone was, like, their zone.

2457
02:19:54,530 --> 02:19:56,750
So we had to cross.

2458
02:19:57,190 --> 02:19:58,290
We had...

2459
02:19:59,910 --> 02:20:01,550
Oh my god, we were all here.

2496
02:25:21,820 --> 02:25:27,240
or were you guys on the winning team or the losing team
because i felt like losing team okay were we all were we all

2497
02:25:27,240 --> 02:25:35,720
losing okay what the fuck was that what they got the beach
we recreated we recreated world war two but like my history

2498
02:25:35,720 --> 02:25:45,240
of playing apex legends the last four years have i ever seen
that zone we we literally had to storm the beach but like we

2499
02:25:45,240 --> 02:25:54,980
lost like that's not what history taught me what the
happened history didn't teach me this like over my frames

2500
02:25:54,980 --> 02:26:02,260
were dying i was on like 90 frames you were on 90 frames
aren't you on roller you don't need the frames yes i do

2501
02:26:02,260 --> 02:26:13,980
you're on roller i can't even shoot my gun it was terrible
that's terrible of course they get the zone and they were on

2502
02:26:13,980 --> 02:26:20,760
control they were on the controller characters like what the
fuck yeah no that zone is crazy i've never seen end on that

2503
02:26:20,760 --> 02:26:27,300
little rock like that it was actually fucking insane
apparently only five people died on the other team that's up

2504
02:26:27,300 --> 02:26:39,660
yeah they said five people died on their side well our tired
team got wiped out we didn't even get a single we didn't we

2505
02:26:39,660 --> 02:26:49,700
only got five i think i got to shoot my gun twice i was just
i was scared i was scared i was gonna shoot my own teammates

2506
02:26:49,700 --> 02:26:58,020
i was so fucking scared everybody was just like in my face
if that zone pulled the middle it would have been so much

2507
02:26:58,020 --> 02:27:02,860
different i feel like yeah that would have been a lot wasn't
there a map where you can turn off zones why didn't we do

2508
02:27:02,860 --> 02:27:09,740
yeah you can't there is a way to like it where you can turn
on zones and just like everybody meets up in one spot and

2509
02:27:09,740 --> 02:27:20,100
just battles it out i feel like why didn't we just do that
instead of letting instead of letting them have all of this

2510
02:27:21,600 --> 02:27:30,220
all right who are we playing who are we playing we need a
new castle i think i feel like a new castle is very helpful

2511
02:27:30,220 --> 02:27:40,040
here oh yeah oh that means three strikes so it's newcastle
uh maybe conduit conduit horizon newcastle conduit horizon

2512
02:27:40,040 --> 02:27:48,400

you play last time we were playing conduit newcastle and

He blocked it.

2705
02:41:28,370 --> 02:41:29,390
He was almost cracked again.

2706
02:41:29,510 --> 02:41:30,070
Hit 50 on blue.

2707
02:41:31,170 --> 02:41:31,610

02:41:32,450 --> 02:41:32,790
I'm going in.

2710
02:41:32,830 --> 02:41:33,070
I'm going in.

2711
02:41:33,250 --> 02:41:34,590
He's on the other side.

2712
02:41:34,910 --> 02:41:35,590
Knock, knock, knock, knock.

2713
02:41:36,970 --> 02:41:37,550
Dead, dead.

2714
02:41:37,890 --> 02:41:38,030
Nice.

2715
02:41:40,430 --> 02:41:40,950
Hey!

2716
02:41:42,650 --> 02:41:43,170
Easy!

2717
02:41:43,830 --> 02:41:46,070
You see nothing to worry about.

2718
02:41:50,090 --> 02:41:52,430
We need to make sure they don't drop back on us.

2719
02:41:53,650 --> 02:41:54,870
They might land on us.

2720
02:41:55,330 --> 02:41:56,890
Yeah, I'm trying to get the loot back.

2721
02:41:57,610 --> 02:41:59,670
I do kind of want a better light gun.

2722
02:41:59,850 --> 02:42:02,310
So if you see like a R9 or 301.

2723
02:42:02,410 --> 02:42:04,510
K2, I have an RE.

2724
02:42:05,430 --> 02:42:06,890
Which isn't the best.

2725
02:42:06,990 --> 02:42:08,930
I dropped a purple energy mag.

2726
02:42:13,440 --> 02:42:15,380
It's a havoc here if anyone wants that.

2727
02:42:16,380 --> 02:42:17,500
Oh, no, thank you.

2728
02:42:20,320 --> 02:42:20,760
Nope.

2729
02:42:26,550 --> 02:42:27,790
What do you think zone's gonna end?

2730
02:42:32,080 --> 02:42:33,580
I can't read zones at all.

2731
02:42:33,680 --> 02:42:35,580
It's gonna pull back the phase driver, Bonza.

2732
02:42:35,800 --> 02:42:38,260
It's probably gonna hard pull back to fucking phase driver
back here.

2733
02:42:38,420 --> 02:42:40,960
Yeah, so we should head over now just to grab a spot.

2734
02:42:41,560 --> 02:42:42,160
Yeah, possibly.

2735
02:42:43,100 --> 02:42:44,000
See if we can, yeah.

2736
02:42:44,400 --> 02:42:46,600
I grabbed in Alt Excel for us.

2737
02:42:47,980 --> 02:42:49,740
Yeah, ping me any...

2738
02:42:49,740 --> 02:42:51,280
Sage and I need light guns.

2739
02:42:51,520 --> 02:42:52,920
Better light guns, so we find any.

2740
02:42:53,360 --> 02:42:55,240
There's an R9 in one of those boxes.

2741
02:42:55,560 --> 02:42:56,040
There is?

2742
02:42:56,220 --> 02:42:57,600
Oh, I'll go.

2743
02:42:58,020 --> 02:43:00,300
Is it from the horizon you killed or...

2744
02:43:00,300 --> 02:43:01,380
Yeah, it's the horizon box.

2745
02:43:01,740 --> 02:43:03,220
It's like right there, I'm pretty sure.

2746
02:43:03,420 --> 02:43:04,700
Oh, you caught all the way there?

2747
02:43:05,200 --> 02:43:06,800
Unless it, like, is gone now.

2748
02:43:07,120 --> 02:43:07,740
Yeah, it's gone.

2749
02:43:08,160 --> 02:43:08,620
Yeah, it's gone.

2750
02:43:08,860 --> 02:43:09,740
Yeah, no worries.

2751
02:43:10,800 --> 02:43:11,460
We'll find something.

2752
02:43:11,580 --> 02:43:13,340
They're fighting in front of us at this show.

2753
02:43:13,580 --> 02:43:14,280
They're poking.

2754
02:43:14,460 --> 02:43:15,240
I don't know if they're fighting.

2755
02:43:15,560 --> 02:43:16,320
I don't know if they're fighting.

2756
02:43:17,980 --> 02:43:23,360
I feel like you should just get like a spot because like
kills don't really matter to us Yeah, I'm just getting

2757
02:43:23,360 --> 02:43:24,520
people out in the end.

2758

They're just gonna It's just gonna like What is it lock up
the The respawn anyway by that by then?

2759
02:43:34,480 --> 02:43:37,840

2760
02:43:38,220 --> 02:43:38,260
It's even Icarus.

Right here.

2768
02:44:05,860 --> 02:44:07,060
We can shoot this kid in the back.

2769
02:44:07,380 --> 02:44:07,820
I'm shooting.

2770
02:44:09,200 --> 02:44:09,800

Yeah, you're here.

2777
02:44:22,560 --> 02:44:23,360
There's somebody over here.

2778
02:44:23,480 --> 02:44:23,620
Over here.

2779
02:44:24,880 --> 02:44:26,080
The last guy is over here.

2780
02:44:26,140 --> 02:44:26,960
The last guy's over here.

2781
02:44:27,680 --> 02:44:27,920
Right here.

2782
02:44:28,500 --> 02:44:29,820
Maybe I'll try to kill him if y'all can.

2783
02:44:30,020 --> 02:44:32,240
Oh, he's kind of...

2784
02:44:32,240 --> 02:44:33,120
I don't know.

2785
02:44:33,780 --> 02:44:34,960
I have the jitter bug.

2786
02:44:35,160 --> 02:44:35,720
I have that bug.

2787
02:44:36,640 --> 02:44:37,380
He ran ran.

2788
02:44:37,520 --> 02:44:38,140
I can't get him.

2789
02:44:38,920 --> 02:44:39,100
Yeah.

2790
02:44:39,260 --> 02:44:39,940
You can come back.

2791
02:44:40,020 --> 02:44:40,400
You can come back.

2792
02:44:40,740 --> 02:44:43,240
I think he's just gonna wait for them to crawl back to them.

2793
02:44:44,400 --> 02:44:44,600
Yeah.

2794
02:44:44,680 --> 02:44:45,900
But there's this other team right here.

2795
02:44:46,000 --> 02:44:47,720
I don't want to, like, separate too much.

2796
02:44:48,940 --> 02:44:49,460
I think...

2797
02:44:49,460 --> 02:44:51,360
I feel like I should get knocked and you guys should res me.

2798
02:44:52,200 --> 02:44:52,820
No, no, no, no.

2799
02:44:53,080 --> 02:44:54,060
I don't want them to, like, int.

2800
02:44:54,940 --> 02:44:59,940
Yeah, but okay, I'll just full heal then where are the
bodies that we killed because they're just gonna crawl to

2801
02:44:59,940 --> 02:45:02,240
them They're just crawling towards them

2802
02:45:06,210 --> 02:45:08,670
Okay, I mean what the fuck is the stone pool

2803

can how many baths y'all have oh I have two I have two

2804
02:45:23,700 --> 02:45:26,100

2805
02:45:26,760 --> 02:45:31,380
Yeah, oh my god Oh, just right here, where they were before.

I'm already close.

2852
02:47:43,430 --> 02:47:45,290
I wonder if I can reset my game.

2853
02:47:45,690 --> 02:47:46,290
I don't know.

2854
02:47:46,630 --> 02:47:47,190
It's risky.

2855
02:47:48,270 --> 02:47:50,550
I mean, I like, I'm fucking shaking all over the place.

2856
02:47:51,230 --> 02:47:53,570
It might be, it might just be because we're on the edge of
the map.

2857
02:47:53,750 --> 02:47:54,850
Like the closer I get like.

2858
02:47:54,950 --> 02:47:55,470
No, it's been the whole game.

2859
02:47:55,610 --> 02:47:56,170
It's been the whole game.

2860
02:47:56,290 --> 02:47:56,630
For you?

2861
02:47:57,010 --> 02:47:57,310
Okay.

2862
02:47:57,790 --> 02:47:58,590
Yeah, go ahead, go ahead.

2863
02:47:58,890 --> 02:47:59,370
Just do it now.

2864
02:47:59,490 --> 02:47:59,990
Might as well.

2865
02:48:00,630 --> 02:48:01,110
It's fine.

2866
02:48:01,290 --> 02:48:01,390
It's fine.

2867
02:48:03,690 --> 02:48:05,550
If you can do it now, then...

2868
02:48:05,550 --> 02:48:06,390
I just don't want to...

2869
02:48:06,390 --> 02:48:07,670
This is not getting back into the game.

2870
02:48:08,310 --> 02:48:08,930
Okay, that's fair.

2871
02:48:10,070 --> 02:48:10,790
We got to rotate.

2872
02:48:12,690 --> 02:48:13,010
Hey.

2873
02:48:14,450 --> 02:48:15,510
Sometimes you can join back.

2874
02:48:15,630 --> 02:48:16,170
Sometimes you can't.

2875
02:48:16,170 --> 02:48:17,150
We're just going to play underneath here.

2876
02:48:17,230 --> 02:48:17,950
We just hold everybody out.

2877
02:48:18,070 --> 02:48:20,070
If there's not a team here, there's a team here, actually.

All these fucking sky naves.

2947
02:52:24,850 --> 02:52:26,870
They don't have a Watson above us, I'm pretty sure.

2948
02:52:27,750 --> 02:52:28,370

There was no way.

2976
02:53:14,590 --> 02:53:15,190
Yeah, that's rough.

2977
02:53:15,530 --> 02:53:17,790
We were not even close to zone.

2978
02:53:19,950 --> 02:53:20,850
All right, nice try.

2979
02:53:21,290 --> 02:53:21,890
Gee, cheese.

2980
02:53:23,230 --> 02:53:24,910
See you guys in the next one.

2981
02:53:26,790 --> 02:53:28,210
Gee, cheese, gee cheese.

2982
02:53:31,640 --> 02:53:32,660
Oh, my God.

2983
02:53:34,900 --> 02:53:38,660
Holy shit, that zone pull was actually crazy.

2984
02:53:39,580 --> 02:53:40,700
Oh, my God.

2985
02:53:43,260 --> 02:53:46,480
We were not even, like, gonna...

2986
02:53:46,480 --> 02:53:48,900
We were not even gonna fucking...

2987
02:53:48,900 --> 02:53:50,840
We're so far!

2988
02:53:51,620 --> 02:53:53,780
This is where the zone landed onto!

2989
02:53:54,040 --> 02:53:54,980
We were here!

2990
02:53:55,600 --> 02:53:57,200
How will we travel?

2991
02:54:00,160 --> 02:54:03,600
How are we gonna travel all the way?

2992
02:54:04,700 --> 02:54:05,220
Jeez!

2993
02:54:08,160 --> 02:54:09,700

on my team, he also plays fifth, so it didn't matter.

3020
02:57:25,740 --> 02:57:27,660
It actually did not matter.

3021
02:57:31,860 --> 02:57:33,280
It's the same.

3022
02:57:38,970 --> 02:57:41,290
My sportsmanship is off the roof.

3023
02:57:42,030 --> 02:57:44,730
I hope Dwells didn't take my banter as too harsh.

3024
02:57:44,850 --> 02:57:46,770
I hope he actually didn't get angry.

3025
02:57:47,890 --> 02:57:49,810
This one's trying to lighten the mood.

3026
02:57:50,510 --> 02:57:55,870
I'll be real as it was just some friendly banter.

3027
02:57:59,850 --> 02:58:01,210
I hope I didn't make him cry.

3028
02:58:01,610 --> 02:58:02,130
Wait, wait.

3029
02:58:10,400 --> 02:58:12,700
He hates VTubers now.

3030
02:58:13,360 --> 02:58:14,420
Join the club.

3031
02:58:15,160 --> 02:58:16,860
Join the fucking club.

3032
02:58:20,980 --> 02:58:23,180
We're playing Apex here.

3033
02:58:27,540 --> 02:58:29,560
Normies don't know what to do.

3034
02:58:34,890 --> 02:58:35,950
Okay, let's see.

3035
02:58:36,070 --> 02:58:36,990
What's our last team?

3036
02:58:37,570 --> 02:58:41,290
All right, our last team is...

3037
02:58:42,970 --> 02:58:44,630
Oh, we got Naughty again.

3038
02:58:45,370 --> 02:58:46,230
And we got Sage.

3039
02:58:46,530 --> 02:58:47,390
What is this rat?

3040
02:58:47,450 --> 02:58:48,690
This is not random.

3041
02:58:49,370 --> 02:58:51,870
I get the same teammates all the time.

3042
02:58:51,890 --> 02:58:52,950
I swear.

3043
02:58:54,150 --> 02:59:04,450
I literally got Sage and Naughty for this is not random this
is this is not where is the variation here

3044
02:59:09,110 --> 02:59:21,770
i literally played with naughty and i just played with sage
last game how is this random a spotify shuffle to be like

3045
02:59:21,770 --> 02:59:31,270
yeah has rigged this for me in what way he rated the
opposite that right if it was rigged i would be on the

3046
02:59:31,270 --> 02:59:32,050
winning team

3047
02:59:37,550 --> 02:59:49,730
if this was rigged i would have been on control i would have
been on fucking control and on the other side i would not

3048
02:59:49,730 --> 02:59:51,290
been an assault character

3049
02:59:59,550 --> 03:00:01,010
All right, let's see.

3050
03:00:01,570 --> 03:00:02,250
We new code.

3051
03:00:02,350 --> 03:00:02,870
New code.

3052
03:00:03,510 --> 03:00:04,350
Where's the new code?

3053
03:00:05,330 --> 03:00:06,050
New code.

3054
03:00:06,310 --> 03:00:06,890
Here we go.

3055
03:00:08,310 --> 03:00:09,450
All right, new code time.

3056
03:00:09,610 --> 03:00:10,070
New code.

3057
03:00:12,250 --> 03:00:13,450
What did I play last time?

3058
03:00:13,490 --> 03:00:14,050
Watson, right?

3059
03:00:14,250 --> 03:00:15,170
Yeah, I was on Watson.

3060
03:00:16,890 --> 03:00:17,370
Watson.

3061
03:00:19,450 --> 03:00:19,790
Okay.

3062
03:00:20,950 --> 03:00:22,610
I didn't leak the code like last.

3063
03:00:22,730 --> 03:00:25,070
I didn't leak the code like Hal did.

3064
03:00:28,830 --> 03:00:35,150
uh i was hoping they were there first so i can just join off
of them but they weren't so i need to fucking look up the

3065
03:00:35,150 --> 03:00:42,730
leaderboard shit again uh let's see team 14 team 14

3066
03:00:45,990 --> 03:00:55,650
all right let's see let me get my bookie up just in case
can't believe it can't believe it what happened to meeting

3067
03:00:55,650 --> 03:01:05,430
new people but not too many new not too many new people
though I like to meet new people gradually like two at a

3068
03:01:05,430 --> 03:01:15,390
time meeting new people I can't believe I can't believe I
got the same teammates what are the odds like I feel like

3069
03:01:15,390 --> 03:01:24,790
almost every game I met like the like one of the person one
person would be the person I played with last game

3070
03:01:28,130 --> 03:01:34,670
tempo gave me a head start with jen and timmy and said
you're on your own and then after that he's like now it's

3071
03:01:34,670 --> 03:01:52,630
real random basically one and two people at a time hey but
it's cool it was great that we got to play with timmy and

3072
03:01:52,630 --> 03:01:54,350
jen though and and like

3073
03:01:59,410 --> 03:02:07,370
the the one minute drop was like the peak there for me that
was with the chicken and rice that was peak right there

3074
03:02:07,370 --> 03:02:20,190
chicken and rice there we go uh hello hello again sage hello
hello again naughty hello i can't believe i've been playing

3075
03:02:20,190 --> 03:02:26,870
with the same people all day it's not random it's not random
they're just putting his back to back with people i refuse

3076
03:02:26,870 --> 03:02:37,150
to is random right yeah i think it's like just i don't even
know just like either crazy luck or bro but then how did

3077
03:02:37,150 --> 03:02:43,710
some teams get like all the pros how does that what the fuck
at least like when you're random you'll be like wait this is

3078
03:02:43,710 --> 03:02:53,190
this is a luck fair let me just move them a little bit like
like what the fuck timmy and deeds on the same team on a

3079
03:02:53,190 --> 03:02:58,410
game mode where you actually shoot the gun i got jen on my
first game but he does we don't shoot our guns because we're

3080
03:02:58,410 --> 03:03:10,370
fisting people like we got another no gun here this one yeah
crazy i'm gonna so pros okay are you the guy that knows

3081
03:03:10,370 --> 03:03:17,930
zones are you the zone guy for your team uh i know zones you
know somewhat okay the zones we've been playing today have

3082
03:03:17,930 --> 03:03:25,150
been crazy oh yeah no they're terrible yeah they've been so
bad they're like hard to guess too but yeah we should we

3083
03:03:25,150 --> 03:03:33,910
should get a good guess here did you call your call your pli
yet yeah yeah down beast all right nice okay yep yep we got

3084
03:03:33,910 --> 03:03:41,490
damn i'm i'm on watson oh watson yep you got watson um and
then i'll play valc and then if you want to play lifeline

3085
03:03:41,490 --> 03:03:55,550
sage yeah or would you rather i actually play lifeline okay
do you not think that's a i yeah yeah it's fine okay also is

3086
03:03:55,550 --> 03:04:04,750
there a slight echo maybe yeah yeah no it's not on not easy
there's an echo sorry about that no it's okay i was like

3087
03:04:04,750 --> 03:04:10,510
maybe i'm just really listening to myself i don't know okay
that's my maybe somebody this time is gonna play crypto

3088
03:04:10,510 --> 03:04:22,810
after the lessons we've learned on the first game maybe
someone will actually play crypto this time i believe i i

3089
03:04:22,810 --> 03:04:24,670
believe Wait, what's the lifeline for?

3090
03:04:26,410 --> 03:04:27,490
Oh, for the self-revive.

3091
03:04:27,610 --> 03:04:28,310
I took my headphones out.

3092
03:04:28,450 --> 03:04:29,350
So if you're talking, I can't hear you.

3093
03:04:29,570 --> 03:04:31,670
Wait, but would it matter though for self-revive?

3094
03:04:31,770 --> 03:04:34,750
Because we're all just going to fucking be in the mosh pit
in the end.

3095
03:04:35,550 --> 03:04:36,170
Oh, I mean, yeah.

3096
03:04:36,250 --> 03:04:38,050
It'll definitely get you some extra placements, though.

3097
03:04:38,250 --> 03:04:39,450
You know, just like...

3098
03:04:40,250 --> 03:04:42,950
Because you still have to get thirsted as lifeline if you
get knocked.

3099
03:04:44,210 --> 03:04:47,750
But at the same time, you might be right regarding that.

3100
03:04:47,870 --> 03:04:48,910
Because there's so many fences.

3101
03:04:49,130 --> 03:04:50,630
But if there's a crypto, lifeline's so good.

3102
03:04:52,190 --> 03:04:53,430
Like if crypto blows up.

3103
03:04:53,450 --> 03:05:04,090
everything up takes all the fences out oh okay okay yeah i
was just thinking like uh i was just thinking like oh man

3104
03:05:04,090 --> 03:05:13,890
are we will she even survive long enough to yeah it's kind
of honestly maybe like a wraith instead of lifeline i don't

3105
03:05:13,890 --> 03:05:22,310
know or like caustic caustic was really good for my first
game or your no punch yeah yeah no punch because we just had

3106
03:05:22,310 --> 03:05:30,010
the gas cans to like make them knock like you know take some
extra damage yeah i mean uh with like gens and stuff it's

3107
03:05:30,010 --> 03:05:36,250
it's hard to do that that's true at the end zone yeah that's
true yeah but like at the same time like it also kills don't

3108
03:05:36,250 --> 03:05:43,130
really matter you know but like yeah again it is only flesh
damage it's just like spacing spacing wise yeah i mean wass

3109
03:05:43,130 --> 03:05:49,050
like insane to like spam fences around because like and
people can't shoot your gen you know you can literally play

3110
03:05:49,050 --> 03:05:55,390
wherever yeah you could play like in the wide open like
everyone looking at you all right so are you gonna do life

3111
03:05:55,390 --> 03:06:05,330
on our race then for sage um that's a good question you made
a good point because i i think valk will be really good yeah

3112
03:06:05,330 --> 03:06:13,930
yeah yeah yeah and then uh i think watson and valk 100 and
then

3113
03:06:17,010 --> 03:06:17,850
What do you think, Sage?

3114
03:06:20,470 --> 03:06:20,890
Sage Doc?

3115
03:06:20,890 --> 03:06:23,010
Do you think like Wraith Portal stuff or...

3116
03:06:24,830 --> 03:06:25,310
Lifeline?

3117
03:06:27,850 --> 03:06:29,630
Boy, I think Sage is AFK.

3118
03:06:30,190 --> 03:06:31,950
I think she's AFK.

3119
03:06:32,390 --> 03:06:32,570
Yeah.

3120
03:06:33,970 --> 03:06:37,810
Yeah, we'll wait for Sage to get back and hear and- We've
got plenty of time.

3121
03:06:38,650 --> 03:06:38,890
Yeah.

3122
03:06:41,290 --> 03:06:43,290
We've got plenty of time to theory craft.

3123
03:06:46,030 --> 03:06:46,510
Right.

3124
03:06:47,010 --> 03:06:54,550
how well have your games been so decent middle of the pack
you know how about you pack uh i think i got like two top

3125
03:06:54,550 --> 03:07:01,970
fives in the beginning and then i peaked and then um i
peaked very early on uh and then ever ever since then it's

3126
03:07:01,970 --> 03:07:11,190
not been great ever since then tempo has definitely rigged
it against me yeah putting us in in the assault category oh

3127
03:07:11,190 --> 03:07:20,650
that yeah that was horrible i think that was the turn my
turning point was when dropped afk for duos and and then i

3128
03:07:20,650 --> 03:07:28,850
got ratted out and instantly no way he had to go afk he was
he was getting his chicken and rice he was getting his

3129
03:07:28,850 --> 03:07:36,290
dinner and then and then i i got i walked up did not see a

I didn't even see that.

3145
03:07:58,290 --> 03:07:59,930
I wasn't even in Team 5.

3146
03:08:00,470 --> 03:08:02,210
I'm not even the last person.

3147
03:08:03,150 --> 03:08:04,650
There's a Team 5.

3148
03:08:05,670 --> 03:08:05,670
do

3149
03:08:09,250 --> 03:08:17,950
we claim down beast already yeah yep we got it okay i
believe uncontested let me double all right nice okay we're

3150
03:08:17,950 --> 03:08:31,620
john oh they forced moved me all right but i still wasn't
the last person i wasn't holding it up they were people

3151
03:08:31,620 --> 03:08:39,160
design full and gen gun okay it's all right there it's
fisting around so it doesn't matter it's like what the is

3152
03:08:39,160 --> 03:08:47,780
team six i think they're actually though actually they won't
be on it yet hello did you say um so yes to lifeline was

3153
03:08:47,780 --> 03:08:54,180
there anything else you talked oh yeah if you want to do
lifeline or race which would you prefer um probably race

3154
03:08:55,240 --> 03:09:02,260
okay i'm not a child but if you but if you want to be yeah
she could queue she could save her queue for the final zone

3155
03:09:02,260 --> 03:09:08,680
yeah like that could be a whole other thing too yeah it's
sort of like up in the air with like if lifeline self-revive

3156
03:09:08,680 --> 03:09:16,700
or race like portal will stall longer than the other like if
she gets knocked out outside a zone when it's tiny then like

3157
03:09:16,700 --> 03:09:26,640
that'd be fucked for her and yeah yeah i just like if
there's a crypto that would be good for us but because that

3158
03:09:26,640 --> 03:09:32,640
would like help everyone sort of yeah i'm pretty sure it
would actually help the entire one must go there must be

3159
03:09:32,640 --> 03:09:38,980
somebody on the enemy team that's gonna go crypto there's no
way after what happened in the first game i i refuse to

3160
03:09:38,980 --> 03:09:44,380
believe no one's gonna go crypto yeah unless everyone's same
thing we are and we're like yeah there's gonna be someone

3161
03:09:44,380 --> 03:09:53,460
that's crypto totally and it has to be but there's like so
many of us here there's so many there's no way one person's

3162
03:09:53,460 --> 03:10:01,100
not going to pick crypto we just need one guy we literally
need one guy to crypto out oh spikes would be good actually

3163
03:10:01,100 --> 03:10:09,620
oh what about catalyst with cat spikes someone just
mentioned that my chat catalyst with cat spikes and like

3164
03:10:09,620 --> 03:10:16,760
like final final like final yeah but when does it watch

3169
03:10:47,900 --> 03:10:52,600

3230
03:15:27,020 --> 03:15:27,140
No!

3231
03:15:27,140 --> 03:15:28,080
Oh, they went through the car.

3232
03:15:29,120 --> 03:15:29,940
I'm going up to the car.

3233
03:15:30,040 --> 03:15:30,520
I'm going up to the car.

3234
03:15:31,280 --> 03:15:32,240
They took the car.

3235
03:15:32,260 --> 03:15:32,500
No.

3236
03:15:34,320 --> 03:15:35,260
He actually has a car.

3237
03:15:36,800 --> 03:15:37,940
I can't believe it.

3238
03:15:38,000 --> 03:15:39,920
He, they actually, we got baited.

3239
03:15:40,480 --> 03:15:41,620
All right, we're gonna let him go.

3240
03:15:41,720 --> 03:15:42,080
We'll let him go.

3241
03:15:42,160 --> 03:15:42,760
Yeah, we should.

3242
03:15:43,060 --> 03:15:44,420
Yeah, yeah, we should grab.

3243
03:15:44,560 --> 03:15:47,940
No, I feel like we really should grab, do like more armor.

3244
03:15:48,060 --> 03:15:48,520
Oh my God.

3245
03:15:48,740 --> 03:15:50,120
My heart sank.

3246
03:15:50,280 --> 03:15:51,600
I thought that was a different team coming in.

3247
03:15:51,940 --> 03:15:52,440
Yeah, let's go.

3248
03:15:53,160 --> 03:15:54,360
Let's go get this cache here.

3249
03:15:54,640 --> 03:15:54,840
Ignore this.

3250
03:15:55,040 --> 03:15:56,080
What is this portal?

3251
03:15:56,860 --> 03:15:57,920
It's a beautiful one.

3252
03:15:58,060 --> 03:15:59,160
It was in your honor, actually.

3253
03:15:59,780 --> 03:16:01,680
Yeah, I want to grab some armor cache.

3254
03:16:02,160 --> 03:16:04,420
We'll take this Evac and then go get this cache up top.

3255
03:16:04,500 --> 03:16:06,460
I can't believe they actually did it.

3256
03:16:06,680 --> 03:16:07,260
Probably go that way.

3257
03:16:07,800 --> 03:16:08,600
No, that was a good play.

3258
03:16:08,700 --> 03:16:09,120
I'm not gonna lie.

3259
03:16:09,280 --> 03:16:12,000
I didn't even think about Bringing the card back close to
them.

3260
03:16:12,280 --> 03:16:13,160
No, yeah.

3261
03:16:13,240 --> 03:16:13,560
Oh my god.

3262
03:16:16,950 --> 03:16:18,770
If I had another arc, he's not getting in that though.

3263
03:16:19,470 --> 03:16:20,010
Yeah, I know.

3264
03:16:20,130 --> 03:16:20,250
Same.

3265
03:16:20,590 --> 03:16:21,290
I didn't have any other.

3266
03:16:21,410 --> 03:16:23,330
I had only nades in.

3267
03:16:23,530 --> 03:16:25,710
I only had nades in Thermite.

3268
03:16:27,370 --> 03:16:28,170
The madman.

3269
03:16:28,930 --> 03:16:30,410
Zion is tripping for that.

3270
03:16:31,350 --> 03:16:32,010
No, that was funny.

3271
03:16:34,530 --> 03:16:35,710
I'm going to go to the ring console.

3272
03:16:36,550 --> 03:16:36,930
Yep, yep.

3273
03:16:37,110 --> 03:16:37,830
You can get that.

Go for it right behind you.

3275
03:16:41,090 --> 03:16:41,870
We'll go to this console.

she was solo solo della oh she was serious we should go grab
this army yep let's get this one okay let's let's save that

3284
03:17:48,450 --> 03:17:55,550

Oh, let's put on this roof.

3290
03:18:13,590 --> 03:18:16,270

3291
03:18:17,790 --> 03:18:20,110
To get over this checkpoint stuff.

3292
03:18:21,050 --> 03:18:21,590

And then we do want to get that one too.

3294
03:18:26,710 --> 03:18:29,150
I think we grab this one first and this choke and then get
this one.

3295
03:18:29,310 --> 03:18:29,930
So we're all in purple.

3296

03:26:53,440 --> 03:26:54,940
Oh my god, they destroyed my fences!

3411
03:26:56,500 --> 03:26:57,340
That's fucked up.

3412
03:26:58,480 --> 03:26:59,580
And that's why you're stunned.

3413
03:27:00,800 --> 03:27:01,720
Look at you.

3414
03:27:02,100 --> 03:27:02,580

My fences.

3417
03:27:13,320 --> 03:27:14,020
My fences.

3418
03:27:19,580 --> 03:27:20,300
They are.

3419
03:27:20,660 --> 03:27:21,140
They are.

3420
03:27:21,540 --> 03:27:22,980
They do not like your fences.

3421
03:27:23,240 --> 03:27:25,320
Wait, Doki, can you put some fences here?

3422
03:27:25,900 --> 03:27:26,060
Okay.

3423
03:27:26,380 --> 03:27:26,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3424
03:27:26,480 --> 03:27:26,940

3426
03:27:29,360 --> 03:27:29,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3427
03:27:30,200 --> 03:27:32,680
They're just slowly coming up to us.

03:27:33,440 --> 03:27:34,140
I do.

3429
03:27:34,800 --> 03:27:36,200
They are actually trying to push us.

3430
03:27:36,260 --> 03:27:37,720
They're just slowly walking up.

3431
03:27:38,040 --> 03:27:38,720
I'm scared.

3432
03:27:39,980 --> 03:27:45,580
Oh, this team here too is like, but that Watson looks like
she's panicking, so I think it's okay.

3433
03:27:45,840 --> 03:27:48,520
Yeah, make sure you have like all 12 fences down around,
like everywhere.

3434
03:27:50,560 --> 03:27:51,440
Bro, stop.

3435
03:27:55,960 --> 03:27:57,460
You're stealing our fences.

3436
03:27:57,700 --> 03:27:58,440
Oh, they broke the gen.

3437
03:27:59,140 --> 03:27:59,800
They broke our gen.

3438
03:28:00,100 --> 03:28:00,740
I have gen.

3439

Oh, you have the chance!

3448
03:28:43,020 --> 03:28:45,940
I am impressed the crypto saved the alt for that long.

3449
03:28:46,640 --> 03:28:48,260
That, oh, no way.

3450
03:28:48,280 --> 03:28:51,420
I can't believe design headbutted me.

3451
03:28:51,700 --> 03:28:54,180
He took the time to be head by me.

3452
03:28:54,640 --> 03:28:55,340
You know what?

3453
03:28:57,360 --> 03:28:58,420
This is crazy.

3454
03:28:59,140 --> 03:29:01,980
Now the crypto alt's, oh my god.

3455
03:29:03,880 --> 03:29:05,600
Oh my gosh, you could totally respawn us.

3456
03:29:06,340 --> 03:29:06,820
Oh, yeah.

3457
03:29:06,880 --> 03:29:08,100
Yeah, you could totally do it.

3458
03:29:08,100 --> 03:29:09,780
Yeah, the worst of...

3459
03:29:09,780 --> 03:29:11,160
Oh, my God, they were...

3460
03:29:11,160 --> 03:29:12,520
There's actually a lot of cryptos now.

3461
03:29:12,620 --> 03:29:13,260
That's crazy.

3462
03:29:14,000 --> 03:29:16,840
There were so many cryptos, but yet nobody crypto alted?

3463
03:29:17,320 --> 03:29:18,780
How the fuck was that?

3464
03:29:19,020 --> 03:29:19,900
They did not care.

3465
03:29:20,620 --> 03:29:21,420
That really sucks.

3466
03:29:22,260 --> 03:29:24,500
Yeah, that caustic was just...

3467
03:29:25,100 --> 03:29:26,740
Yeah, that caustic was so clutch.

3468
03:29:27,960 --> 03:29:30,260
I'm surprised that no one fucking...

3469
03:29:30,980 --> 03:29:33,420
I'm surprised that no Watsonall ate that caustic.

3470
03:29:33,440 --> 03:29:41,440
alt yeah yeah i didn't think it was one that was in between
three different watson alts how is that possible that's okay

3501
03:31:50,140 --> 03:31:57,440

3503
03:32:10,240 --> 03:32:17,040

3505
03:32:24,040 --> 03:32:27,920
Oh my god, you actually got Goomba stomped.

3506
03:32:28,620 --> 03:32:31,960
I think I would have, I think I died mid-air as I was going
up to a Burtnade coming down.

3507
03:32:32,000 --> 03:32:32,180
Yeah.

3508
03:32:33,520 --> 03:32:34,320
That is so unlucky.

3509
03:32:34,320 --> 03:32:34,980
That's so rough.

3510
03:32:36,820 --> 03:32:37,720
Nice try.

3511
03:32:38,060 --> 03:32:38,780
That would have been it.

3512
03:32:38,820 --> 03:32:40,800
That would have actually been a crazy, crazy comeback.

3513
03:32:41,300 --> 03:32:42,440
The Goomba stomped.

3514
03:32:42,860 --> 03:32:43,940
Holy shit.

3515
03:32:44,200 --> 03:32:48,460
I saw there was barely any cryptos for how many crypto
players in a game.

3516
03:32:49,140 --> 03:32:49,780
Yeah, there was.

3517
03:32:50,640 --> 03:32:58,780
that is wild oh my god wait no there is there's two crypto
players and i i swear i only saw two crypto alts in the end

3518
03:32:58,780 --> 03:33:11,820
yeah oh well ggs guys ggs ggs ggs i got a great time ggs
i'll see you guys yeah bye oh that's actually crazy i can't

3519
03:33:11,820 --> 03:33:13,800
believe he got gloomba stomped i can't

3520
03:33:20,280 --> 03:33:26,940
god how how is that possible he somebody was on top of him
and then he died

3521
03:33:31,460 --> 03:33:42,460
oh my god how much money did we make i think we made like 1k
more than 1k 1.5k i'm pretty sure i think i made like 1.5k

3522
03:33:42,460 --> 03:33:50,960
i'm pretty sure because we had two top fives and that was
like 900 i think i think that was like 900 uh oh wait not

3523
03:33:50,960 --> 03:33:59,280
800 sorry did I say 900 $800 and then we get the $500 entry
fee so like when we're in there when you get in you get $500

3524
03:33:59,280 --> 03:34:09,260
automatically by just playing and then like all the other
games I think add up would be 1.5 I had a great time it was

3525
03:34:09,260 --> 03:34:19,200
fun it was fun I definitely peaked in the beginning um I
definitely uh my uh my gameplay peaked in the beginning and

3526
03:34:19,200 --> 03:34:21,080
then it was downhill from there

3527
03:34:25,660 --> 03:34:35,040
our placement went downhill from there but we got top five
in two different games we got top five in two games in a row

3528
03:34:35,040 --> 03:34:42,000
so it was a fun stream i had a really great time meaning uh
meaning all these people it was fun i had a great time

3529
03:34:42,000 --> 03:34:53,140
meaning everybody and um and it was fucking free money we
love free money chat like like we love free money guys and

3530
03:34:53,140 --> 03:34:54,400
that's all that matters

3531
03:34:59,450 --> 03:35:09,690
that's all that matters i'm gonna make sure if there's
anything else we have to do but i think we're good to go
