1
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:05,780
Oh, hello, hello, everyone.

Ed, hi, everyone.

4
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:26,300
Okay, so, um, when I started, when I, when I picked this
game, and also, hey, Stevie, when I picked this game, I was

5
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,380
like, oh, it looks cute.

6
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:29,380
That looks cute, because I saw someone else playing.

7
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:30,700
I was like, oh, it looks so cute.

8
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:33,080
Look, it's Pixlr, and, like, she's in a house.

9
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:41,120
and oh it's like an adventure game it's like a puzzle game
and then i was like i'm gonna play this on stream and then i

10
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:49,600
um i put the tags down on the stream i i was changing
categories and the first tag that showed up was horror and i

11
00:00:49,600 --> 00:01:05,280
was like how is this horror it's a fucking pixel game how So
I was like, oh fuck I mean it's kind of puzzle game With

12
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:18,400
more panic I guess Oh shit Puzzles and horror Oh no That's
the worst combination So I Hey obviously also thank you so

13
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,320
much for the follow up prototype I do appreciate it Thank
you thank you Have a have a but heart Thank you so much

14
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:28,420
Alright so apparently I'm going to be doing puzzles We'll
have a time limit, and it's going to be scary.

15
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,240
So all three things, all my worst traits combined together.

16
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,560
That's great.

17
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:39,720
That's great.

18
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,300
I'm very much looking forward to it.

19
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,420
So we're not, you're not late yet.

20
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,320
I haven't started the playthrough yet.

21
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,640
Because I want to like procrastinate a bit.

22
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:52,980
Because apparently the game's like 30 minutes long, and
there's like a time limit.

23
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,320
So I basically have 30 minutes.

24
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,360
To not die, which that means there's gonna be many attempts.

25
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:06,820
There's gonna be many attempts on this Because there's a
time limit too and it's 30 minutes so I don't fucking know

26
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:13,900
how I'm gonna go through this Cause first of all there's
puzzles in there and I'm gonna get chased and then I'm

27
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:18,180
somehow have to like Make sure you know what I don't even
care if I get the worst ending I just want to finish this

28
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:24,040
game I don't even I'm pretty sure I'm gonna get the worst
fucking ending also hey classic

29
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:30,320
Are you guys ready for me to start the game?

30
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:31,800
I'm not ready.

31
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:35,300
I have no idea what the plot of the story is.

32
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:36,700
I just noticed that you're a girl.

33
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:39,440
It's pixel art and it's spooky.

34
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,440
That's all I know.

35
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,940
I'm trying to time to sleep before the trip tomorrow.

36
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,360

52
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,220
Hey, I'm a cute girl.

53
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:12,990
All right.

54
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:14,430
Okay, we don't read here.

55
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:15,910

Dude, this is a 30...

82
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:09,110
I can't believe you've done this.

83
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:11,050
I wish I could stay longer, but I don't want to go to sleep.

84
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,150
Alright, it's okay, Ed.

85
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:13,770

00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:19,110
Oh, shit.

What the fuck?

91
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:20,510
I don't know.

92
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,650
His dad will come home at midnight and you have a mom and a
sister.

93
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:25,030
Well, I apparently have a cat, too.

94
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:26,310
Okay, wait.

95
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:27,170

00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:27,710
I need to turn...

97
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:28,690
Turn the volume down.

98
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:31,150
It is so fucking loud in my ears.

99
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:31,610
I did.

100
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,300
I can pour this?

101
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:39,100
What do I do with this?

102
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,320
Is this milk?

103
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:41,540
What am I holding?

104
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:49,610
Wait, how do I...

105
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:50,510

00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:51,050
Wait, no?

107
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:52,150
How do I get a key?

108
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:53,550
Key?

109
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:54,690

116
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,060

00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:43,170

You guys hear my little frog, champ.

00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:49,820
Why do people keep dying around me?

556
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:50,900

Cat, wake up.

562
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:16,050
I need the key.

563
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:18,490
I don't- I've been playing for 36 minutes.

564
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,650
I've been doing this for 36 minutes.

565
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:21,990
Is this insanity?

566
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:25,330
Is this- I thought I could- Daniel just wanted to get an
ending.

567
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:27,350
I don't care how many people die.

568
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:28,830
I just want this game to end.

569
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:34,530
I don't care how many people die.

570
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:36,370
I just want this game to end.

571
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:37,870
Oh,

572
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:42,740
I should...

573
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:45,120
Okay, but then she's gonna die through the bear trap.

574
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:52,030
I don't care how many people I sacrifice.

575
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:55,010
I just want to end this game.

576
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:56,950
I just want this game to end.

577
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:02,290
Hey, please, please, please stop.

578
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:07,770
Okay, so I got everything I need.

579
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:09,470
I just don't know how to...

580
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:10,210
Is she gonna die?

581
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:10,750
Oh!

582
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:13,850
Well then, at least she's okay.

583
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:15,150
At least she's not crushed.

584
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:16,310
That's alright.

585
00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:20,250
She's okay.

586
00:32:22,530 --> 00:32:23,490
She's okay.

587
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:27,270
Oh, shit.

588
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:28,310
Do I crush the frog?

589
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:29,570
Alright, frog.

590
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:30,770
I'm sorry.

591
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:32,350
Oh.

592
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:37,810
Well then.

593
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:39,910
It's okay, I saved her.

594
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:40,810
She's safe.

595
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:42,890
And then I take this.

596
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:44,350
And then...

597
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:44,890
It's okay.

598
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:45,670
She's okay.

599
00:32:46,930 --> 00:32:48,250
I think being...

600
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:50,370
I think dying from a bear trap is...

601
00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:51,170
Look, she's happy.

602
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:51,950

00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:53,190
Oh, she's not happy!

604
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:54,330
She's not happy!

605
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:00,130
I don't think she was...

606
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:03,070

607
00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:11,350

Why can't you eat the sandwich?

616
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:01,960
Why can't you eat the sandwich?

617
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,680
All I want you to do is eat.

618
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,460
Why can't you eat?

619
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:17,980

00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:19,540
I thought I got it down.

621
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:21,940

622
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:24,580
Sastron, thank you so much for the follow.

623
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:25,420

Thank you.

625
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:26,380
Thank you.

626
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:27,140
Alright.

627
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:29,060
Okay, I got this down.

628
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:34,060
Did he just say, oh, you just rub your face too close to the
mouth?

629
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:35,460
Okay.

630
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:38,980
How do I even save her?

631
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:39,860
I don't understand.

632
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,840
What do I do with this?

633
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:46,040
Okay, if I put it here, it should be okay, right?

634
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:49,680
Alright, I'll put this here for now.

635
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:53,540
And then...

636
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,360
Okay, alright, alright.

637
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:03,440
Come on, my cat.

638
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:04,520
Look up!

639
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:05,220
Thank you.

640
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,100
Okay, and then I gotta go get...

641
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:08,640
Easy ride.

642
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,260
Doesn't make Chan nasty from no sister killer.

643
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:14,700
I just wanted to be an only child!

644
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,680
Is my mom gonna die?

645
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:17,880
Oh no, she's okay.

646
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:18,380
Okay.

647
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,140
Is that too much to ask for?

648
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:26,460
I just want it to be an only child.

649
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:30,880
I'm gonna call it here.

650
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:32,100
My back is killing me today.

651
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:32,540
Have fun.

652
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:34,280
Don't murder anyone else.

653
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,960
Oh, I don't know about that.

654
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,420
I kill a cat here?

655
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,300
No, I shouldn't.

656
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:43,820
I guess the cat's the only one I know how to keep alive.

657
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:44,840
So I-

658
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:50,480
No, you feed the rat the sandwich.

659
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:53,540
But then I don't know what else to do after that.

660
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,020
I don't know how to save my sister.

661
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:56,560
So, it's okay.

662
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,840
We don't care about her.

663
00:35:58,380 --> 00:35:59,360
We just want the sandwiches.

664
00:36:04,850 --> 00:36:05,490
I can.

665
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:06,510
I try to.

666
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:07,670
I try to crush it.

667
00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:09,310
Alright, I haven't killed the mom.

668
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:11,010
But the mom just disappears.

669
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:12,470
So, I don't know where the fuck she goes.

670
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:14,250

I just don't know why it's not working now.

680
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:40,440
The rat for some reason doesn't want to eat my sandwiches
for some reason.

681
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:41,420
I don't know why.

682
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:44,360
I think my sandwiches are perfectly good.

00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:50,060
I thought I was so smart.

724
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:54,080
How do I do this?

725
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:59,500
I didn't appreciate you bear trapping this boy.

726
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,600
I was like, he's dead.

727
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:07,940
So mom gets eaten by a fridge and dad's up is a face eating
four of them, man.

728
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,160
No, this family's got it all.

00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:19,420
Thank you so much.

Dude, I hate how like this takes 20 years.

735
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:31,760
It takes him 20 years to get his cat ass off.

736
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:36,120
Like the cat's the only one I can save.

737
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:41,500
I can't even tell this is a horror game where a make people
never win game.

738
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,500
I'm never gonna win.

739
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:49,820
It's similar to man get caught in the bear trap.

Oh, thank you so much.

Okay, bye.

895
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:26,200
You know what?

896
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:27,320
Oh, oh, I forgot the

897
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:36,000

898
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:38,600
Oh, oh, no!

899
00:48:46,690 --> 00:48:48,430

901
00:48:50,170 --> 00:48:50,750
Oh.

902
00:48:53,830 --> 00:48:56,690
Oh, I killed the cat and the mom.

903
00:48:58,510 --> 00:49:02,550
Look, I just need, I need this to fucking hurry up.

904
00:49:03,750 --> 00:49:05,430
Look, it's not my fault.

905
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:08,330
Shadow Man, I don't have time for your shit.

906
00:49:08,530 --> 00:49:09,270
I don't know.

907
00:49:11,410 --> 00:49:12,590
Okay, there we go.

908
00:49:12,810 --> 00:49:13,070
All right.

909
00:49:16,270 --> 00:49:17,730
All right, I need to swing my hammer.

910
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:22,340
Do this?

911
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:23,740
What?

912
00:49:27,370 --> 00:49:29,190
I just wanted to open the closet.

913
00:49:29,670 --> 00:49:30,730
I just wanted to...

914
00:49:31,890 --> 00:49:34,170

915
00:49:35,290 --> 00:49:35,850
Thank you.

916
00:49:35,870 --> 00:49:37,010
I got worried again.

917
00:49:37,230 --> 00:49:41,090
Well, we don't need the mom.

918
00:49:42,150 --> 00:49:43,890
We've learned that we don't need the mom.

919
00:49:44,550 --> 00:49:45,910
We don't need the sister.

920
00:49:46,110 --> 00:49:48,470
We might need the cat, but I forgot about the cat there.

921
00:49:53,550 --> 00:49:54,470
I keep forgetting.

922
00:49:56,250 --> 00:49:58,210
How do I do this shit?

923
00:49:58,530 --> 00:50:00,150
Alright, so we don't need a lot of people.

924
00:50:00,270 --> 00:50:01,130
We just need the cat.

925
00:50:01,550 --> 00:50:02,630
We just need the cat.

926
00:50:04,610 --> 00:50:06,050
I hope you had a good stream, Crow.

927
00:50:06,150 --> 00:50:07,170
I hope you had a good stream.

928
00:50:07,910 --> 00:50:08,370
Alright, alright.

929
00:50:09,090 --> 00:50:09,630
Don't worry.

930
00:50:10,650 --> 00:50:10,650
Bam.

931
00:50:10,910 --> 00:50:11,350

Wait, that's not it.

958
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:34,680

959
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:35,720

You would think that this was supposed to be a 30-minute
game.

What is the easiest way to win this game?

My brain is getting bigger.

1113
01:01:57,730 --> 01:01:58,990

Then I'm gonna save the sister!

1117
01:02:08,450 --> 01:02:10,050
We don't give a fuck about the sister!

1118
01:02:10,570 --> 01:02:13,370
Alright, sister, here's your stupid sandwich.

1119
01:02:15,590 --> 01:02:17,370
Sister, I got you a sandwich!

1120
01:02:18,950 --> 01:02:20,070
Is she gonna die?

1121
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:20,930

1122
01:02:22,930 --> 01:02:24,070

01:02:25,110 --> 01:02:26,360
I got your sandwich sister.

1124
01:02:33,060 --> 01:02:35,590
Well, it appears that...

1125
01:02:37,260 --> 01:02:39,850
It appears that it didn't work.

1126
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:45,800
Guys, it appears that the sandwich did not want a night
living.

1127
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:50,400
That wasn't it.

1128
01:02:51,340 --> 01:02:52,060
That wasn't it.

1129
01:02:52,060 --> 01:02:52,820
Well then.

1130
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:00,800
Oh

1131
01:03:04,330 --> 01:03:08,350
Sandwich does not save the sister.

1132
01:03:08,750 --> 01:03:13,550
Well, I've learned I've learned that how do I win this how
do I fucking win this?

1133
01:03:14,330 --> 01:03:17,710
Please someone backseat please backseat this game for me

1134
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:25,720
I hate backseat gamers

1135
01:03:33,020 --> 01:03:39,000
This is just pain this is just pain at this point Wait, all
I feel is pain.

1136
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:50,300
I swear, okay, if we don't figure out a solution by the
15-minute mark, we're fucking done with it.

1137
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:52,540
We're fucking folding up a tutorial.

1138
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:56,680
We've been stuck on this one area.

1139
01:03:59,860 --> 01:04:01,340
I have a doll?

1140
01:04:04,670 --> 01:04:06,150
Oh, wait, I should save my mom first.

1141
01:04:06,370 --> 01:04:06,790
I should...

1142
01:04:10,310 --> 01:04:11,290
But I don't want to save...

1143
01:04:11,290 --> 01:04:13,310
Okay, but the thing is, I don't need to save my sister.

1144
01:04:13,450 --> 01:04:14,430
My sister is optional.

1145
01:04:14,930 --> 01:04:15,850
Like, we don't need her.

1146
01:04:17,010 --> 01:04:19,250
There's no reason to have her in our lives.

1147
01:04:20,570 --> 01:04:21,770
Oh, should I need the bowling ball?

1148
01:04:24,990 --> 01:04:26,770
We don't need the sister in our lives.

1149
01:04:26,910 --> 01:04:28,470
So that's just an optional thing.

1150
01:04:29,310 --> 01:04:30,490
I want to be an only child.

1151
01:04:39,420 --> 01:04:40,900
Just kill her with a bear trap bar.

1152
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:42,360
What if it's up, but then what if I'm dead?

1153
01:04:42,940 --> 01:04:44,140
What if I'm dead?

1154
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:45,420
Whoa!

1155
01:04:48,460 --> 01:04:49,900
Will you hold me?

1156
01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:50,200
Okay.

1157
01:04:51,340 --> 01:04:51,780

1158
01:04:53,420 --> 01:04:54,300
My sister.

1159
01:05:08,940 --> 01:05:10,000
Oh, she doesn't want you.

1160
01:05:15,990 --> 01:05:17,430

Yeah.

1162
01:05:18,530 --> 01:05:20,750
What if I put her in the room?

1163
01:05:20,950 --> 01:05:21,690
I'll put her in there.

1164
01:05:23,190 --> 01:05:24,470
I'll just drop her here once.

1165
01:05:26,990 --> 01:05:28,270
Will you hold me?

1166
01:05:28,450 --> 01:05:28,570

We don't give a shit about the doll.

1240
01:09:25,580 --> 01:09:26,980
