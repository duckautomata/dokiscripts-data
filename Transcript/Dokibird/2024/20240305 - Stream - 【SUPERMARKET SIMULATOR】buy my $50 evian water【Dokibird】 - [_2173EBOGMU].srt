1
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,940
Hello, hello.

2
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:05,580
I was, the past two days, working.

3
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:16,240
Yes, although it says rest day, or until the next highest,
I'm still working.

4
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:19,280
There's no stopping with the work.

5
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,260
Oh my god, there's so much behind-the-scenes stuff to do.

6
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:33,940
Oh, okay, because I'm the boss now I can talk about this
stuff without having to worry about like can I talk about

7
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:34,260
this?

8
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,380
I'm the boss.

9
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,060
I say I can talk about this.

10
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,180
So like what things?

11
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:51,280
That was very stressed out about by the way Oh my god,
opening a store and running a store is so hard.

12
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:59,500
Oh my gosh Because there's a lot of things that can happen
that because we're all starting out my team is just starting

13
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:07,540
out i'm just starting out running a john ass store like you
know the best i have done was etsy and artist alley so like

14
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:20,620
um you said rest day you well i didn't say who's gonna be
resting what i might have been implying that you're the one

15
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:28,060
that's resting not me the thing about being a streamer is
that technically there's no actual rest days When you're a

16
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:34,820
streamer because you're always working like you give
yourself the rest day Because your your whole job is to

17
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:41,340
stream and to like keep up your platform your social
platform and all that fucking shit If I was that's why I'm

18
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:48,980
playing supermarket simulator so I can be like I can be a
real person You know it's not like I'm working at a

19
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:56,700
supermarket where I just Where I just check in through my
hours and then check out and not have to worry about the

20
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:14,150
anymore instead as a streamer we always have to worry about
everything stream ends you think we stop working well like

21
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:21,570
for some people maybe but for me I'm still working because I
have to like make sure that I you know make sure that I

22
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:23,230
still have a income coming

23
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:36,750
you don't know that anyway um so you think of a super chat
thank you thank you also then welcome to the tomato farm

24
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:44,730
welcome welcome okay anyway where was I okay yes anyway
where the store was is incredibly difficult it's such a huge

25
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:56,490
learning process especially opening up the store to more and
more um to more and more like people from different

26
00:05:56,490 --> 00:06:04,930
countries so one of the biggest issue mistake I found out
yesterday um I was like looking through like uh because like

27
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:12,590
finally I had time to look through like the orders and the
um the payments and stuff like that and the analytics so I

28
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:19,110
was looking at the store analytics yesterday and then I
noticed I was like this only applied to the lunar new year

29
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:23,650
merch by the way so like do not worry about like oh my gosh
Tokyo what were your other mergers are you okay with the

30
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:28,230
other merch so this only applied to the lunar yeah This is
the pain of being self-employed.

31
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:29,910
The Lunar New Year merch.

32
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:34,130
So I was looking and I was like, Oh, okay, someone ordered
the Lunar New Year recloccupied Stand.

33
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:35,630
So then I was like, all right.

34
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:42,390
Okay, and then I looked at it and I realized, wait a minute,
why is the stand three dollars shipping?

35
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:44,850
I was like, that's for stickers.

36
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:53,410
And then I realized almost everybody that had ordered
individual Lunar New Year stands were paying three dollars

37
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:54,210
for shipping.

38
00:06:54,730 --> 00:07:03,510
So I was like freaking like okay shipping is not three i
might be trying to make shipping cheaper but it's definitely

39
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:13,590
not three dollars so now i was like oh my guys what the
happened so there was like a mistake and somehow only the

40
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:24,270
lunar new year acrylic stand got affected by this thankfully
it's changed now it's changed it was changed yesterday night

41
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:31,970
when we caught it but like i'm taking the lost because
obviously like we're all still starting out and everything

42
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:40,790
and so like i don't want to refund that because it was like
um the mistake was on our side and not on the customer side

43
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:50,230
so like i was like okay it wasn't that bad it was only like
only like 50 people bought the sand so i was like I can tank

44
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:51,630
50 people.

45
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:53,190
Like, I get it.

46
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:59,050
I was just like, it wasn't really a lost, lost.

47
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:01,010
Like, there's still profits going on.

48
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:04,610
Just, um, it's just people who individually ordered the
send.

49
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:06,150
Like, it's just that.

50
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:07,330
And I was like, it's all right.

51
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:09,810
It's like, it's just, it's fine.

52
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:11,910
Like, there's still a profit for it.

53
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:19,990
It's just, um, you know, regarding that, it's just like,
they, they're still paying for that so I was like it's fine

54
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:33,150
it's fine I'll just I can I can take the cost for them okay
I it's just the longer I do this the more experience we're

55
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:41,430
gonna get so I'm it's okay I'm happy to take the mistakes
now then later on because I'll be like okay if it was like

56
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:50,190
oh my god thank you for the 50 get the chips thank you thank
you masters thank you for 50 good the ships thank you thank

57
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:57,830
you i really appreciate it but i was like i prefer i'd
rather we make these mistakes now than later down on the

58
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:06,150
line when it will be a that like if it was a thousand people
then we would have an issue but like now like i'd rather

59
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:15,230
just take it now than later on down the line so we've
learned our team is learning as we go along building more

60
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:15,630
and more

61
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:26,970
I had to I was going through that but it's okay like we
we're not really we're not losing money in the end even

62
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:37,950
though that happened we're not losing money it's just that
like regarding that it's just not like as much profit versus

63
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:46,890
the other if we if this shipping was like the right cost
like like it's just a couple of dollars like the shipping

64
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:53,530
because like normally the shipping would be like seven to
eight dollars instead of three so like i was like okay

65
00:09:53,530 --> 00:10:04,410
that's fine that's fine like i'm willing to tank that and it
wasn't that big of an amount so um robin thank you for the

66
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:09,250
super chat thank you thank you yeah i was like it wasn't a
thousand i'm Okay, it didn't even hit a hundred.

67
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:10,790
It only it was two digits.

68
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:19,870
It's fine So I was doing I was handling I was having that
because I was like thinking this is a learning experience

69
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:27,670
for for the team and I Having a store is like one of the
hardest I think like our everything the store is definitely

70
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:35,630
the hardest thing to to deal to deal with because like
Obviously there's like so many factors and then like also

71
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:50,230
like the currency the currency like converting and
everything um and it's just oh my god it is it's a lot it's

72

Anyway, I was like, Dealing with a lot of the work stuff for
that.

88
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:49,010
So, so being my own boss is a lot.

89
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:51,730
It's definitely a lot of stuff going on.

90
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:54,330
There's been a lot of meetings I had to attend.

91
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:57,090
A lot of meetings I had to attend.

92
00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:01,110
A lot of like contracts I had to sign.

93
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:01,910
A lot.

94
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:04,010
I was just like, oh my God.

95
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:11,370
But I can also delegate my work too.

96
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:14,070
So, like, I'm not doing everything myself.

97
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:16,390
I delegate it to other people.

98
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:18,290
So, I'd be like, you do that.

99
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:19,710
And you do that.

100
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:24,010
So, like, at best, I don't even have to attend that many
meetings.

101
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:29,930
Because, like, the, like, my team attends a lot of my
meetings, too.

102
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:32,590
And then they just, like, tell me what's going on.

103
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:33,770
And I'm like, that's great.

104
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:37,270

00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:04,570
That's not the Apex special stream.

116
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:05,850

I don't remember what the date it is.

120
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:15,670

We're not made of money.

684
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:58,920

I'm just a small business.

714
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:51,360

On, okay, you clearly need sunscreen.

746
00:52:59,340 --> 00:53:03,160
If you spend less at the hair salon, maybe you can afford.

747
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:05,360
Granny Ron's bread.

748
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:09,140
Now your family's gonna be breadless.

749
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:12,020
You can clearly afford fucking bread.

750
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:17,980
If you only have $100 bills, you can totally afford bread.

751
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:22,540
You're just a cheapskate.

752

You know what you were expecting in Half Foods.

913
01:04:35,150 --> 01:04:39,870
It might not have been a good business choice to be right
next to Whole Foods.

914
01:04:40,510 --> 01:04:44,550

Alright, how much should the flower be?

969
01:10:20,210 --> 01:10:21,430
Okay, $5.

970
01:10:22,270 --> 01:10:23,470

Thank god for reminding me.

01:37:52,310 --> 01:37:54,170
It's time to turn off the heat as well.

1338
01:37:55,950 --> 01:37:57,890
You don't need heat at night.

1339
01:37:58,690 --> 01:38:00,510
Guys, just open the door.

1340
01:38:03,430 --> 01:38:04,310
The wind.

1341
01:38:05,450 --> 01:38:08,450
We don't need heat because we can close the door.

1342
01:38:09,110 --> 01:38:11,790
If it's very humid, we can open the door at night.

1343
01:38:14,230 --> 01:38:15,230
Or, wait, no, no, no.

1344
01:38:15,410 --> 01:38:16,390
Okay, if it's hot, if it's hot.

1345
01:38:16,410 --> 01:38:26,490
too hot we open the door so it's cooler with the wind coming
in if it's winter if it's winter we close the door and like

1346
01:38:26,490 --> 01:38:37,790
just make sure we don't open the door so the heat will stay
in and then we if it's like too hot we don't need ac we just

rest of their life and listen to this two-minute repeat.

The worst part is that it's like two minutes repeat too.

1423
01:45:18,270 --> 01:45:20,330
That's the worst part of it all.

1424

It's not like...

1425
01:45:21,830 --> 01:45:23,150
There's no variety.

1426
01:45:23,450 --> 01:45:26,490
It's literally two minutes long, and it's just going on
repeat.

1463
01:48:21,150 --> 01:48:31,990
Guys, it says here that this music contains inaudible,
subliminal recordings that were intended to increase buyer

1464
01:48:31,990 --> 01:48:34,450
purchasing at grocery stores.

1465
01:48:34,970 --> 01:48:42,530
Customers were influenced to purchase more products as a
result of the brainwave patterns hidden in the musical notes

1466
01:48:42,530 --> 01:48:44,210
and the sound composition.

1467
01:48:44,610 --> 01:48:45,110

1519
01:52:37,390 --> 01:52:40,290

1524
01:52:45,490 --> 01:52:46,410
Wait, what's over here?

1525
01:52:46,970 --> 01:52:47,630
Oh, my bread!

01:52:47,910 --> 01:52:48,970
Okay, we need bread.

1527
01:52:50,830 --> 01:52:51,710
Guys, we did it.

1528
01:52:51,750 --> 01:52:52,870
We made our first thousand.

1529
01:52:54,370 --> 01:53:07,990
we were here oh my god look at all these items were almost
sold out look at that it works the subliminal messaging i

1530
01:53:07,990 --> 01:53:12,030
knew i knew there was science to it

1531
01:53:21,430 --> 01:53:28,690
i'm the best employee Burrito, thank you for the magenta
soup, but thank you.

1532
01:53:29,670 --> 01:53:33,210
I thought Doki was a gamer, but she's all about the cheese.

1533
01:53:33,510 --> 01:53:35,890
I have always been all about the cheese.

1534
01:53:36,070 --> 01:53:38,510
I've been cheesing every video game I touch.

1535
01:53:40,810 --> 01:53:41,770
Look at that.

1536
01:53:42,350 --> 01:53:45,970
I think that subliminal music has worked better for the
water than the cheese.

1537
01:53:46,110 --> 01:53:46,810
Not gonna lie.

1538
01:53:47,990 --> 01:53:49,410
Please, we're three levels away.

1539
01:53:50,090 --> 01:53:51,490
We're three levels away.

1540
01:53:51,770 --> 01:53:53,650

Okay.

1546
01:54:08,290 --> 01:54:09,770

1547
01:54:10,750 --> 01:54:11,870

1548
01:54:12,610 --> 01:54:12,890

1551
01:54:16,550 --> 01:54:18,210

1576
01:55:54,570 --> 01:55:57,490
I never said where it's important.

1577
01:55:58,090 --> 01:55:59,670
Did I say Madagascar?

1578
01:56:00,070 --> 01:56:00,830
Peanut oil?

1579
01:56:01,710 --> 01:56:03,750
I meant Madagascar city.

1580
01:56:08,430 --> 01:56:11,890
I meant Madagascar city, guys.

1581
01:56:14,390 --> 01:56:15,850

1582
01:56:15,850 --> 01:56:16,710
Did I say Italy?

1583
01:56:17,570 --> 01:56:19,770
I meant little Italy in New York City.

1584
01:56:24,050 --> 01:56:25,430
It is important.

1585
01:56:25,810 --> 01:56:27,990
Just not where you think it's important.

1586
01:56:29,810 --> 01:56:33,470
Guys, you don't want to support the grandmas in Little
Italy?

1587
01:56:34,550 --> 01:56:35,930
Can I agree?

1588
01:56:38,430 --> 01:56:42,850
Yeah, I meant the Madagascar movie themed oil.

1589
01:56:43,250 --> 01:56:52,250
You know how companies, like, to sell vegetables to kids,
they just put, like, cartoon characters on there to, like,

1590
01:56:54,170 --> 01:56:59,890
like there's nothing there's nothing different between the
vegetables it's literally just like like they just slap

1591
01:56:59,890 --> 01:57:07,050
shrek there to be make you eat more veggies because they're
like oh my god look this carrot these carrots have shrek's

1592
01:57:07,050 --> 01:57:18,630
face on it eat your veggie kids so it's basically like that
I slapped the Madagascar movie it's just marketing nice

1593
01:57:18,630 --> 01:57:30,970
there you okay I think it's time I think it's time to change
swap up the music going crazy I think I'm I'm low-key going

1594
01:57:30,970 --> 01:57:50,530
crazy with this song so I for the sake of everybody's sanity
I was about to spend money too I was almost about to spend

1595
01:57:50,530 --> 01:58:05,670

do not do not worry why i saved this all i was like oh no

1596
01:58:05,670 --> 01:58:18,150

had to stop myself as well for all of us for all of us it

1597
01:58:18,150 --> 01:58:22,610
was for the greater good Let me find better music real fast.

1598
01:58:25,110 --> 01:58:26,590
Honestly, I didn't really hear...

1599
01:58:26,590 --> 01:58:29,150
Since I generally work in a grocery store.

1600
01:58:29,590 --> 01:58:30,690
I feel...

1601
01:58:30,690 --> 01:58:33,510
Yeah, I think workers who had to work...

1602
01:58:33,510 --> 01:58:36,950
Like the supermarket workers that had to listen to the...

1603
01:58:36,950 --> 01:58:39,310
I'm pretty sure they don't change up the songs, right?

1604
01:58:39,410 --> 01:58:40,250
At the supermarket.

1605
01:58:40,650 --> 01:58:42,990
Or at any targets or whatever.

1606
01:58:43,110 --> 01:58:44,570
They don't really change up the song.

1607
01:58:44,830 --> 01:58:47,470
So every day you're just listening to the same song.

1608
01:58:47,770 --> 01:58:49,270
Over and over and over.

1609

Used to work in electronic slot and the song playlist was
bad.

02:02:05,960 --> 02:02:08,720
But during Christmas, it was literally torture.

02:02:09,880 --> 02:02:11,140
Mariah Carey's.

1658
02:02:11,380 --> 02:02:14,120
The thing is, there's not a lot of Christmas music, too.

1659
02:02:14,760 --> 02:02:19,940
Especially for one that you have to do it for hours and
hours straight.

1660
02:02:20,300 --> 02:02:24,820
There's not enough music to keep up for Christmas season.

1661
02:02:25,360 --> 02:02:26,120
There's like what?

1662
02:02:26,180 --> 02:02:27,820
Two hours max of songs.

No, nobody's buying my cheese anymore.

1814
02:13:04,510 --> 02:13:07,330
The cheese market crashed.

1815
02:13:10,610 --> 02:13:15,150

market crash.

1822
02:13:31,010 --> 02:13:31,890

02:13:35,590 --> 02:13:37,290

The cheese bubble burst.

1835
02:13:51,090 --> 02:13:52,270
I can't believe it.

1836
02:13:52,770 --> 02:13:55,070
How will France sustain themselves now?

1837
02:13:55,310 --> 02:13:56,890

Not buying another fridge.

1903
