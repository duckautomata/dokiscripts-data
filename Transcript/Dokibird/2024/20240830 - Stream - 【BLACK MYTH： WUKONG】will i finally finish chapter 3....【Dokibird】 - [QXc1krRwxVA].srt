00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:50,730
Hello everybody, what are you guys talking about?

2
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:54,270
The intro has been looped like three times already, guys.

3
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:57,550
What do you mean?

4
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:59,430
You guys saw it.

5
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:01,270
You guys saw the emotes, the guitar.

6
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:04,810
I saw the guitar emotes and the clapping to the intro.

7
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:06,510
What are you talking about?

8
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:09,530
It's been, it's been looping.

9
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:10,590
Oh, yeah, right.

10
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:11,690
It was four times.

11
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:12,830
It was four times.

12
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:13,970
That was on you guys.

13
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:14,570
It was on me.

14
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:15,930
That was on you guys.

15
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:17,650
All right.

16
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:19,830
I'll tell you guys a story.

17
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:21,470
Today.

18
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:26,850
So the member goons, you already heard the story, but I'll tell them why.

19
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:31,330
I'll tell them why I was very, I was very sleep-deprived.

20
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:32,170
I still am a little.

21
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:36,350
All right, so story time.

22
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:43,650
For those who don't have members, I will be telling you a story that the member goons have already heard, but I'll be retelling it.

23
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:54,150
So, um, today, last night, had to be one of the worst hour, like worse sleep I've ever had in my life.

24
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:55,710
It was actually terrible.

25
00:02:56,030 --> 00:03:12,570
Like, because Doki Amberdoge's dad here, decided that he was like, I'm gonna wake this bitch up four to, not even four, six to seven times throughout the night.

26
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:15,190
For no reason.

27
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:15,930
No reason!

28
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:16,930
NO REASON AT ALL!

29
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:24,210
So you guys might be wondering, why was he waking me up 6-7 times throughout the night?

30
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:29,250
Well, yesterday, for the very first time...

31
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,510
Not the very first, I got a babysitter.

32
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:33,770
Like a new babysitter for him.

33
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:37,330
Because yesterday, I wanted to go to the fair.

34
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:39,010
To the local fair.

35
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:42,990
And I found this new babysitter.

36
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:46,330
Like this is the very first time I used a babysitter.

37
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:47,990
I used this particular babysitter.

38
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,950
She had really good credentials and everything.

39
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:53,910
And the reason why I didn't take him to a normal daycare...

40
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:56,030
Was because...

41
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:57,390
Was because...

42
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:02,050
He does not have his vaccines up to date.

43
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:07,430
So like the daycare needed him to have the kennel cough vaccination up to date.

44
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:08,790
And obviously...

45
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,590
Well, not obviously.

46
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:11,370
That's not me.

47
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:12,650
I...

48
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:16,050
The kennel cough vaccination has expired for him.

49
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,650
And I actually tried to...

50
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:20,350
I tried to book an early...

51
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:24,730
I tried to book a vet appointment a week and a half ago.

52
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:31,770
But literally, the earliest time that the vet could take me in was September 4th, by the way.

53
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:35,510
It was September 4th was the earliest that he could...

54
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:39,490
That the vet could take dad in for his shots.

55
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:41,770
And I didn't have that time.

56
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:42,650
Like I couldn't...

57
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:44,370
I didn't have that time.

58
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:45,610
And...

59
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:47,730
Basically...

60
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:50,430
So I had to get like a personal babysitter.

61
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:52,490
It was very expensive, by the way.

62
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:53,230
It was very expensive.

63
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:55,790
And I got a personal babysitter for him.

64
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:56,930
And...

65
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:01,590
I don't know what the fuck she and her husband did.

66
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:04,730
But when he came back...

67
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:06,430
He was so...

68
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:07,330
I don't...

69
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:08,990
He was so spoiled.

70
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:09,770
Like...

71
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:10,570
She...

72
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:12,890
She did...

73
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,410
Too good of a job.

74
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:18,890
She did way too good of a job.

75
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:20,290
Because...

76
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:23,210
Because when I got him back...

77
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:26,850
When I fucking got this guy back...

78
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:27,810
Like...

79
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:28,810
Oh my god.

80
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:30,570
I was like, it's sleep time.

81
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:34,710
Because basically the babysitter took care of him from 9 a.m.

82
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:36,470
to 9 p.m.

83
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:37,990
And so...

84
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:39,810
I was tired.

85
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:40,850
I was tired from the fair.

86
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:43,030
And so I was like...

87
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:43,990
Okay, I'm gonna go...

88
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:45,270
I'm gonna go head to bed.

89
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:46,230
I pet him.

90
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:46,850
I cuddle him.

91
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:47,510
And I was like...

92
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:48,430
Alright, it's sleep time.

93
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:50,010
He gets to sleep on my bed.

94
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:51,670
It's not like I kicked him off my bed.

95
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:53,070
He gets to sleep in my bed.

96
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:54,730
And then so I was like...

97
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:55,450
It's sleep time.

98
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:56,250
But then...

99
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,350
When I got in bed...

100
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:58,610
He like jumped on the bed.

101
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:00,450
And he looked at the door.

102
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:01,910
And then started crying.

103
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:03,910
Like he started whining.

104
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:04,950
He's like...

105
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:08,710
And I was like...

106
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:09,170
What the fuck?

107
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:10,650
Like I've never heard that voice...

108
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:12,630
Like I've never heard that sound before.

109
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:13,470
I was like...

110
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:15,190
You've never done this before.

111
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:16,170
Never.

112
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,630
I've never heard him whine like this before.

113
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:20,350
And he's like...

114
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:25,430
Looking at me.

115
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:27,530
He was looking outside the door.

116
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:30,050
And then...

117
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:31,430
And then he like...

118
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:32,930
Jumped down the bed.

119
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:33,750
And walked...

120
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,270
And I just walked over to the door.

121
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:36,390
Like the outside door.

122
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:37,670
And he was like...

123
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:39,610
And he's like...

124
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,610
And then he walked...

125
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,330
And then he walked back into my room.

126
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:45,190
And then...

127
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:45,890
And I was like...

128
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:46,510
Oh my god.

129
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:47,330
Anyway...

130
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:48,430
I fell asleep one time...

131
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:48,870
Once...

132
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:49,530
When I fell...

133
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:51,010
The first time I fell back asleep...

134
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:51,870
He woke me up.

135
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:52,830
Because he started barking.

136
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:53,930
He started barking like...

137
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:55,310
And I was like...

138
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:55,570
What...

139
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:56,750
What do you want?

140
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:57,450
What...

141
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,390
I was like...

142
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:00,270
I was like...

143
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:01,730
What do you want?

144
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:02,870
And then...

145
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:04,170
And then he just like...

146
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:04,590
He just...

147
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:05,610
He like...

148
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:06,350
Gets down.

149
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:07,010
And then...

150
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:07,610
Gets...

151
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:08,790
Walks out of my room.

152
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:09,570
And then I just...

153
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:10,250
Heard like...

154
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,430
The pitter patter.

155
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:13,850
The pitter patter of his like...

156
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,510
Feet on the wooden floor.

157
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:16,010
And I just...

158
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:17,010
He's just walking around.

159
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:18,970
He's just walking around the floor.

160
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:19,910
And then he...

161
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:20,710
He went back.

162
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:21,790
He went back to my bed.

163
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:22,870
And then...

164
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:23,890
Stopped barking.

165
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:26,350
And he did this six to seven times.

166
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:29,290
At one point I just closed the door.

167
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:30,390
I closed the door.

168
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,510
And then he woke me up.

169
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:32,970
And started barking at the door.

170
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:33,550
I was like...

171
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:34,770
Open the door.

172
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:35,490
Open the door.

173
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:36,090
And I was like...

174
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:36,230
What?

175
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:38,770
Usually...

176
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:39,550
When I had...

177
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:40,010
To sleep.

178
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:41,450
He goes to sleep.

179
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:42,270
Instantly.

180
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:42,950
With me.

181
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:43,770
He...

182
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:45,210
He goes to sleep.

183
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:46,130
Instantly.

184
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:47,270
With me.

185
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:47,810
And...

186
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:48,630
But this time...

187
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:49,230
This time...

188
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:50,170
He wouldn't stop.

189
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:51,130
He wouldn't...

190
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:51,530
I...

191
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:52,610
I tried to ignore him.

192
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:53,350
But then...

193
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:55,010
It was also really late at night.

194
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,050
And I was like...

195
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:56,790
Oh my god.

196
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,310
And then...

197
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:02,790
And then he finally...

198
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:03,250
Like...

199
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:03,570
I...

200
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:04,890
At eight a.m.

201
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:06,570
I couldn't take it anymore.

202
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:09,070
He woke me up so many times.

203
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:09,530
And then...

204
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,230
At eight a.m.

205
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:12,570
He was like...

206
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:14,910
Now it's time to walk me.

207
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:16,410
And I was like...

208
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:17,110
What the fuck?

209
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:17,390
Like...

210
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:19,490
He usually never demands this from me.

211
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:20,510
I was so surprised.

212
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:25,110
Usually he would never demand walkies or food.

213
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:26,450
Or feeding time.

214
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:27,230
Like...

215
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:29,050
He and I have an understanding.

216
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:30,050
Where like...

217
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:31,210
I'm very busy.

218
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:32,810
So he and I...

219
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:34,270
We have an understanding.

220
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:35,590
Where...

221
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:36,130
We...

222
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:39,510
He would get walkies and food around eight a.m.

223
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:41,330
Like...

224
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:42,450
Those were the hours.

225
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:47,190
He would never demand what time the walkies and foods are.

226
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:51,550
He would sleep with me until it was time for me to get up.

227
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:52,650
And I was like...

228
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:53,730
It's walking time.

229
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:55,110
It's feeding time.

230
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:56,090
He would...

231
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:58,650
He would be going by my schedule.

232
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:00,730
Not by his own.

233
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:02,970
And today...

234
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:03,910
This morning...

235
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:09,270
He demanded that I walked him and feed him at eight a.m.

236
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:09,510
And I was like...

237
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:10,050
He...

238
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,530
He was...

239
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:15,270
He was very demanding.

240
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:17,510
And at that point...

241
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:19,790
And then when I did his walkies...

242
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:20,390
And his...

243
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:22,370
When I did his walkies right after...

244
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:22,890
He was like...

245
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:23,110
Alright.

246
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:23,490
I'm done.

247
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:24,090
I'm okay now.

248
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:25,810
And then he falls straight...

249
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:27,190
He falls asleep right away.

250
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:28,410
Because I was like...

251
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:28,730
I can't.

252
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:29,170
I need a nap.

253
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:30,230
I can't.

254
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,090
I'm so tired.

255
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:31,770
I need a nap.

256
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:33,730
And then he never woke me up.

257
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:35,270
He never woke me up.

258
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:37,610
My alarm woke me up at twelve p.m.

259
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:39,390
He didn't wake me up once.

260
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:39,510
And I was like...

261
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:41,250
He just was like, all right, sleep time.

262
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:46,540
Still, sleep time.

263
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:47,740
Okay,

264
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,580
it was sleep time.

265
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,460
Now you're okay.

266
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,080
Oh my god.

267
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:02,600
And then...

268
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:08,380
Okay, I showed this photo during the member stream.

269
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:15,840
I showed this photo and I was like, okay, that makes sense why he's like this now.

270
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:18,600
Let me show you guys the photo.

271
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:27,080
This is basically one of the photos the babysitter sent me of like, how fucking spoiled he was.

272
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,820
Like, look at this.

273
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,740
He's just like, bring me back.

274
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:44,200
I was like, okay, I understand.

275
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:47,020
I understand.

276
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:53,720
And then today, this is right after the member stream, by the way.

277
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,480
This is right after the member stream.

278
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:02,380
Today, today, I was like, I had to get food.

279
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,440
This is also why I was late.

280
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,060
I was finishing up eating my dinner.

281
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,780
I didn't have lunch, by the way.

282
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:10,340
I need you guys to know I didn't have lunch, so this was like my first meal.

283
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,160
So, this was right after.

284
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:21,700
I had my food at like, around like, I had my first meal at around like, 5 40.

285
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:27,600
So, the thing is, I went downstairs to pick up my food.

286
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,060
Right?

287
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:40,160
So like, um, the thing is, dad would have never whined about, it was so, okay, I like, I went to open my door to go downstairs, right?

288
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:48,260
And then dad instantly jumped down from the bed, and then went up to the door, and the moment I closed the door, I hear him crying.

289
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,140
He was like, oh, the

290
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,260
door!

291
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,360
And I was like, what the fuck?

292
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,620
We've done this before!

293
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:03,200
We've done this before!

294
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:05,520
Why are you crying?

295
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:06,640
Why?

296
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,520
You've seen me walk downstairs and cry before.

297
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:14,740
What happened?

298
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:20,020
One day, I leave you alone for one day.

299
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,160
Why?

300
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,680
What happened?

301
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,900
Like, what happened in the span of one day?

302
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:35,140
Like, it wasn't even a full night.

303
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:40,640
It wasn't even, like, I went down, I literally could hear him while I was waiting at the elevator.

304
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,420
I heard him while I was waiting at the elevator.

305
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,440
And all I could hear was, oh, oh.

306
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,540
I was like, why?

307
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,800
You know I'm coming back!

308
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,140
I'm just getting food!

309
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:54,780
And

310
00:12:58,070 --> 00:12:58,570
hours!

311
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:00,810
I'm literally getting food!

312
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:12,270
But yes, anyway, so, and then, like, I came back up from the food and he was still, I don't hear the crying anymore.

313
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:14,570
I just see him at the door.

314
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:17,690
Like, he was just at the doorstep just waiting for me.

315
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:19,130
And I was like, what?

316
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:20,770
What happened?

317
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:20,950
What happened?

318
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:25,630
I've left before, even at the old apartment!

319
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:28,330
Like, I had to get food before.

320
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:34,410
He would never, he would be like, whenever I had to get food at my old apartment, he didn't give a fuck.

321
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:35,890
He did not care.

322
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:36,850
He just slept.

323
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:39,270
He just would be like, oh, she's out to get food?

324
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:42,510
Let me stay in my fucking bed and sleep.

325
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:45,850
And then when I have the food, he's just like, oh, there's your food.

326
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:47,790
Let me keep on sleeping!

327
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:48,430
.

328
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:53,130
.

329
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:57,090
I was like, holy shit.

330
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:59,270
What the fuck happened to you?

331
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:00,350
.

332
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:03,570
He was finally shown love.

333
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:04,390
.

334
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:04,430
.

335
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:10,250
Anyway, so I made, like, a comparison.

336
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:18,190
Basically, it's like, basically, dad is like the lonely housewife for wine.

337
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:24,430
I am the overworked husband that's just trying to make money for us to survive.

338
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,550
And the babysitter is the pool boy.

339
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:28,750
.

340
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:36,480
.

341
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:36,980
.

342
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:41,740
I'm just like, please, I'm just trying to work.

343
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:42,700
I'm sorry.

344
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:45,540
I'm sorry, dad.

345
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:50,340
I'm just trying to work so that you can have food on the table.

346
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,320
I'm trying.

347
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,460
You need to let me sleep.

348
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:57,080
And you want me to keep working.

349
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:03,460
Anyway, that's, like, life update right now.

350
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:07,240
That's the life update for him.

351
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:13,260
Yeah, so, like, I'm definitely not gonna use this babysitter very often now.

352
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:17,560
And, like, for very, very, very rare occasion.

353
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:26,400
After this fucker gets his kennel cough vaccine, I'm fucking sticking him to the daycare if I need somebody to look after him.

354
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,840
I'm putting him in the doggy daycare.

355
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:43,920
It's cheaper and also, like, he does not He does not demand things from me right after.

356
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:47,480
No!

357
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:47,820
No!

358
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:50,080
Don't take this away from him!

359
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:52,160
This is where he feels at!

360
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,400
No, no, no.

361
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,020
We cannot.

362
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,900
I need to sleep, guys.

363
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:56,840
I...

364
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,340
I need to fuck...

365
00:15:59,340 --> 00:15:59,800
Oh, yeah!

366
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,700
By the way, when we got...

367
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:10,780
When I got, like, um, uh, dad back, uh, when I got dad back, picked him up from the babysitter, I was like, how is he?

368
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:14,240
And then the babysitter was like, oh, he loves attention.

369
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:18,680
And I was like, yeah, yeah, I can see that.

370
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:23,000
Like, you know, I, like, glossed over the fact because I was like, yeah, he does.

371
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,240
He sort of does love attention.

372
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:29,420
But I didn't realize how much attention that the sitter gave him.

373
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:31,300
Like, I did not realize!

374
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,480
I just, like, glossed over it because I was like, that sounds right.

375
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:37,560
Yeah, like, he does.

376
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:40,260
He does like it when he, you know, he does like cuddling in bed.

377
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:41,320
So, like, yeah.

378
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:46,260
And then now I realize what she meant when she said, he loves attention.

379
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:01,960
Um, so yeah, that is life update for this fucker.

380
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:20,800
Also, um, I won't talk too long about uh, the some, if you want to know more story about how my life was like at the fair, that it would be a member exclusive story because, uh, it took me 48 minutes to tell that story.

381
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:30,560
And, like, I don't want to spend another 48 minutes telling the story about the fair.

382
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:38,880
So, unless you ask me about the story at the convention, I'll tell you the story about the fair story at the convention if I'm there.

383
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:39,820
Okay, guys?

384
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,040
If I'm there, I'll tell it to you.

385
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:47,600
Also, did you guys know Mihoyo made a fucking nuclear reactor?

386
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:57,040
I just wanted to, this is like off-topic about everything, but, like, uh, I really, I Did you guys see that?

387
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:57,360
Yeah!

388
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:07,580
Yeah, the company that makes Genshin Impact and, like, um, there's a ZZZ and um, yeah, they made a nuclear reactor.

389
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:08,580
Yeah!

390
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:12,040
No, like, in real life, not fucking in game.

391
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:17,740
They literally made a nuclear reactor in real life and I was like, holy f- yeah, I was like

392
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:30,120
I saw, I read an article about it and I was cause, like, there's this whole meme about, um, oh yeah, they sponsored a reactor.

393
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:35,060
They, like, this is still fucking crazy to think about.

394
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,840
Here's the article.

395
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:38,600
It, like, showed up on my Twitter.

396
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,900
Um, they've officially had too much money.

397
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:46,000
Like, literally gotcha money has sponsored a nuclear reactor.

398
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:53,820
That's when you know, um, that's when you know they might have a bit too much money.

399
00:18:56,180 --> 00:19:02,140
Yeah, it's apparently for the environment but that's still the craziest shit I've ever read, like, yesterday.

400
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:11,040
They're like, yeah, Mio, you fucking sponsored a nuclear react- I think they sponsored, like, the space program in China, too, I think.

401
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,780
I'm not that- don't quote me on that.

402
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:17,480
But, like, I saw somebody mention that, too, and I was like, what?

403
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:22,640
They- They sponsored a space journey?

404
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:24,100
Like, whoa!

405
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,060
Jesus!

406
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,120
Um...

407
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:51,360
Yeah, today's reactor is sponsored, uh, by- That was a different- a different guy- okay, the fact that, like, it's also a, um, that a gacha game- like, there- there's enough gacha games there's enough gacha money to the point that, like, a different gacha game sponsored a space program.

408
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,020
That is wild.

409
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:58,880
I should make a gacha- I can't imagine if I made a gacha game.

410
00:19:59,200 --> 00:19:59,800
That's-

411
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:10,600
Holy shit, maybe then I can sponsor a nuclear reactor that's just for me.

412
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:15,680
Um...

413
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,920
Let's see...

414
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:19,720
Alright.

415
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,020
Thank you.

416
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:40,100
Anyway, I don't know if today my PC- if my PC decides to explode again for, um, and we don't- we're not gonna go to the hub area, but if my PC decides to fucking explode again today, um, I'm gonna- I'll take it to the shop.

417
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,200
I'll take it to the shop.

418
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:48,760
Um, or- okay, so, actually, Hyatt actually reached out asking, like, if they could help with anything.

419
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:54,000
I might ask if they could just- if I could get, like, another PC and then do a- do a- finally!

420
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:58,200
Do a dual PC setup because this is rea- I don't know how.

421
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,520
I don't know how I- I can...

422
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,700
I'm this cursed when it comes to PC.

423
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,480
Like, I- I don't know.

424
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:09,000
I just- I don't know anymore.

425
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,400
I'm just forever cursed.

426
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:16,380
Like, it's just- life is just like that.

427
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:20,700
I've, like, accepted my, um, I've accepted my destiny.

428
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:23,600
I'm just cursed to forever have PC issues.

429
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,480
Like, nothing- nothing can save me.

430
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:32,740
If a- if two PCs cannot save me, then, like, it's over.

431
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,060
It's actually over.

432
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:40,040
Alright.

433
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:42,040
Um, but yes.

434
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:44,320
I don't - I don't even know where I was at.

435
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:48,740
I was so mad about the whole PC stuff that, like, I don't...

436
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:50,820
How?

437
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:55,540
Let's see.

438
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,440
How am I?

439
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,700
How- How am I not?

440
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:06,660
Like, that crash fucked my PC so much that it's never been the same.

441
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,800
It's never been the same.

442
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:13,480
I don't- the thing is, I don't know what it did.

443
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:15,660
I don't know.

444
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,160
I don't know.

445
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,740
Wait, where am I?

446
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:23,020
Where am I?

447
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:23,240
Okay.

448
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,660
I don't know what I did.

449
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:29,640
Let me see.

450
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,060
Whatever happened that day.

451
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:36,980
Whatever happened that day, it was never the same.

452
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:40,020
It was never the same.

453
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,280
Okay, we're gonna figure this out, guys.

454
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:44,380
We're gonna figure this out together.

455
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:47,160
Like, we can figure this out together, guys.

456
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,240
I- I believe.

457
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,360
I fucking believe.

458
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,280
Like, okay, the worst part- Let me tell you guys.

459
00:22:55,400 --> 00:23:00,340
The worst part is that my CPU and my memory is okay.

460
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,000
Like, I- It's okay.

461
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,080
That's the thing.

462
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:05,420
That's the worst part.

463
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,760
Like, it's okay.

464
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,180
Like, How is that- How is that possible?

465
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:19,000
How- Like, it's not even- It's not like 70%.

466
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,160
It's not like it's on 100.

467
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,640
That's the thing.

468
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,320
It's not like it's at 100%.

469
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,480
How is this possible?

470
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:29,900
Okay.

471
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,540
What the fuck?

472
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,460
What happened?

473
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,080
What happened to you ever since that crash?

474
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,440
You've changed.

475
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:37,880
You've changed.

476
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:38,540
Oh, God.

477
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,700
Ever since the crash.

478
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,360
Ever since the crash of 24.

479
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:47,140
And something happened to you.

480
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:50,860
Okay.

481
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:51,960
I have an idea.

482
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,200
I know what to do, guys.

483
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,920
I have an idea.

484
00:23:56,460 --> 00:24:00,500
I'm not- Oh, God.

485
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,220
You changed.

486
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:04,680
Alright.

487
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:05,580
Frame generation.

488
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:08,200
Okay.

489
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:09,600
Alright.

490
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,780
We're gonna turn off frame.

491
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:11,800
Generation.

492
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:12,860
Alright.

493
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:13,440
Here we go.

494
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,180
Maybe that's it.

495
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:18,500
Maybe.

496
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:19,680
Maybe.

497
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:20,580
Okay.

498
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,480
I have an idea.

499
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,520
I have an idea, guys.

500
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,440
I know what to do.

501
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,880
I'm gonna disappear for a sec.

502
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:27,420
I have an idea.

503
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:28,260
Chat.

504
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:36,140
This is- I know what to do, guys.

505
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,440
I know what to do.

506
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,200
I know exactly what to do.

507
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:39,980
Guys.

508
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:40,520
Okay.

509
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:41,540
Alright.

510
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,400
Manage.

511
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:43,300
Okay.

512
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:44,800
Where are you?

513
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:45,940
How do I start?

514
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,900
I can do this.

515
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,480
There's no way.

516
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:51,140
This game will not win over me.

517
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:58,060
I don't know what happened.

518
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:01,200
Ever since the crash of 24.

519
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:08,420
Nothing's been the same since the crash of 24.

520
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:10,640
Okay.

521
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,740
I'll figure this out.

522
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,880
I know what to do, guys.

523
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,380
I figured it out, guys.

524
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:15,840
There's no way.

525
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,680
There's no fucking way.

526
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:18,620
Guys.

527
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:19,800
I figured it out.

528
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,680
I know what to do.

529
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:22,840
Okay.

530
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,140
Where the fuck is it?

531
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:25,540
Guys.

532
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:26,880
Ignore when I said that, guys.

533
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:27,840
I know what I'm doing.

534
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:30,440
Okay.

535
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,200
I said, where the fuck is it?

536
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,420
I don't mean it.

537
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,160
I know exactly what I'm doing.

538
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:36,940
Okay.

539
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:38,140
Alright.

540
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,040
Okay.

541
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:40,420
Nice.

542
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:41,380
Alright.

543
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,680
This should be it.

544
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:44,640
Alright.

545
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:45,960
Here we go.

546
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:47,960
Alright.

547
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:48,580
We can do this.

548
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:49,600
Alright.

549
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,000
I'm back.

550
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,040
I'm back.

551
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:52,860
Alright.

552
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:53,420
Here we go.

553
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:54,920
There's no way.

554
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:58,100
There is no way.

555
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:01,000
There's no way.

556
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:04,180
Like, what happened to you?

557
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,220
Like...

558
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:09,020
This is a crash!

559
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:10,720
You've never been the same!

560
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,640
We're figuring this out, guys.

561
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,140
We can do this.

562
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:17,440
I believe in us.

563
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,980
I believe in us.

564
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:21,440
There's no way.

565
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:23,000
There's actually no way.

566
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,860
There's actually no way.

567
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:27,060
Wait.

568
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,820
What the fuck?

569
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,160
Oh my gosh.

570
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:33,220
Is my Nvidia control settings okay?

571
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:34,780
Let's see.

572
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:37,240
Am I supposed to have G-Sync, by the way, guys?

573
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:42,400
Guys, I don't know if I'm supposed to have G-Sync on, guys.

574
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,800
Am I supposed to have G-Sync on?

575
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,160
Am I supposed to have G-Sync on?

576
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:46,200
Am I supposed to have G-Sync on?

577
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:46,260
Yes?

578
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:46,880
Okay.

579
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:48,260
No?

580
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,400
Yes.

581
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,080
Okay.

582
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:51,700
Alright.

583
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,300
That's good enough.

584
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,460
I think.

585
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:58,080
Where are the settings?

586
00:26:59,400 --> 00:26:59,920
Okay.

587
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,100
I have G-Sync on.

588
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,080
Yes.

589
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:03,360
Okay.

590
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,700
Guys, this is like tech support.

591
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,080
But like, live.

592
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,180
Let's just have live tech support.

593
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,420
What's the worst that could happen?

594
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:16,280
Okay.

595
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,060
Continue training.

596
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,000
Alright.

597
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:22,700
Here we go.

598
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:24,100
Here we go.

599
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:25,980
Alright.

600
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,840
Someone said I should lower super resolution to 60%.

601
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:29,680
Should I do that?

602
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,500
You are my tech support now.

603
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:35,600
Don't worry.

604
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:38,840
The gaming part will be ready soon.

605
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,120
Ready soon.

606
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:42,920
Alright.

607
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:45,580
Oh my god.

608
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,760
What happened to you?

609
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:47,680
Oh god.

610
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:48,920
What happened to you?

611
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,400
Oh god.

612
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,020
Alright.

613
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:54,320
Okay.

614
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:54,980
60%.

615
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:58,700
Alright.

616
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,020
Apply.

617
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:02,280
Yes.

618
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:03,480
Okay.

619
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:04,300
Maybe that's it.

620
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:07,140
Okay.

621
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:08,020
Maybe that's it.

622
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:08,260
Okay.

623
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:08,260
Maybe that's it.

624
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:08,260
Alright.

625
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:10,060
Is there anything we can like turn down?

626
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:11,660
We don't need shadows, right?

627
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,100
Okay.

628
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:12,680
Shadows.

629
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:13,460
Shadows.

630
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:13,920
Medium.

631
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:14,720
That's fine.

632
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,160
Hair quality.

633
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:16,740
Okay.

634
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,660
You know what?

635
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,440
We don't need good reflections.

636
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,820
Like, that's fine.

637
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:24,620
Global.

638
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,860
I don't even know what that even means.

639
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:29,600
I don't want to turn down vegetation.

640
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,280
But I want to look at the grass better.

641
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,400
I want...

642
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:36,180
I want to look down the grass.

643
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,680
But I want the grass to look better.

644
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:40,740
Oh my god.

645
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:41,220
We fixed it.

646
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:41,740
Wait.

647
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:42,520
Is it...

648
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,820
Did we fix it?

649
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:46,980
Did we fix it?

650
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,100
Oh my god.

651
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:48,580
Everything...

652
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:49,140
Oh my god.

653
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:49,720
We did it.

654
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,040
Look.

655
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,520
I don't want to touch grass again.

656
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:57,260
So I need to live vicariously through.

657
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:59,340
Oh my god.

658
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,180
We fixed it.

659
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:00,760
We did it.

660
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:01,760
Oh my god.

661
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,740
We fucking did it.

662
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,780
Oh my god.

663
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:05,260
Okay.

664
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:05,740
Here we go.

665
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:06,800
Let's get home.

666
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:09,460
Alright.

667
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:10,800
It's okay.

668
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,000
That's all it took, guys.

669
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:12,500
Alright.

670
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:13,400
Where should we go?

671
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:17,980
I know I went here because I was very frustrated and just kept going forward.

672
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,200
Oh my god, everybody.

673
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:24,600
We fucking did it.

674
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:29,020
We're not gonna fight the tiger!

675
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:32,340
The tiger fucking made my PC explode.

676
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:38,150
I mean, there's so many monkeys.

677
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:39,210
Not white.

678
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:51,150
And my PC crashes again after we fight the tiger.

679
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:52,290
I swear to fucking god.

680
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:52,790
I...

681
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:56,370
This is not fair!

682
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:00,770
I was trying to talk to my chat!

683
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:02,510
Okay.

684
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:03,150
Nice.

685
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:05,550
You think I care that you're blocking?

686
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,690
Oh, maybe I do care.

687
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:10,050
Oh shit.

688
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:10,970
I did not mean to do this.

689
00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:11,530
Okay.

690
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:12,470
That's fine.

691
00:30:12,930 --> 00:30:13,550
That's fine.

692
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:14,330
Monkey friends!

693
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:16,290
Monkey friends!

694
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:17,130
Go forth!

695
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:18,950
Alright.

696
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:19,350
Nice.

697
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:20,890
Go monkeys!

698
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:24,090
Do your monkey things!

699
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:25,630
Oh no.

700
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:26,990
My monkeys are dying.

701
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:28,570
It's fine.

702
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:29,170
It's fine.

703
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:31,930
Monkeys are frozen!

704
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:32,450
Monkeys!

705
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:33,890
Do your monkey thing!

706
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:35,630
Wait.

707
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:36,110
Is he dead?

708
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:37,610
Did I do it?

709
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:39,210
What the fuck was that?

710
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:41,390
What the fuck?

711
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:43,550
What did I do?

712
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:45,330
What was that?

713
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:46,750
Is he gone?

714
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:47,970
Wait.

715
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:48,710
That was it?

716
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:51,330
What?

717
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:54,530
That was it?

718
00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:55,450
Alright.

719
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:57,290
I'm just gonna...

720
00:30:58,370 --> 00:31:00,490
I'm just gonna go get my magic back.

721
00:31:01,410 --> 00:31:02,610
Like what the fuck?

722
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:03,150
What's the point?

723
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:06,030
I'm just gonna get my magic back at this point.

724
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:14,470
He ran away so like I can reset my magic.

725
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:17,530
Alright.

726
00:31:17,730 --> 00:31:18,110
See?

727
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:19,030
He's not gonna fight me again.

728
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:20,030
He's a fucking coward.

729
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:24,050
There's...

730
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:26,750
He lost the one and...

731
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:27,410
He won and done.

732
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:32,470
Imagine losing and then try...

733
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:34,190
You're supposed to one and done when you win!

734
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:38,510
Losing with a one and done doesn't...

735
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:39,590
Oh this is really cool.

736
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:42,930
Losing in a one and done doesn't put the same message out.

737
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:45,210
Alright.

738
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:45,570
Let's go.

739
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:47,770
Oh.

740
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:49,150
Oh these guys are dead dead.

741
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:50,410
They give me will?

742
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:51,070
Oh they do.

743
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:52,110
So I might as well kill it.

744
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:54,010
Alright.

745
00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:54,450
Nice.

746
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:55,570
Alright.

747
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:55,950
Here we go.

748
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:57,590
Oh!

749
00:31:57,670 --> 00:31:58,490
It's a blind guy.

750
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:00,410
It's fine.

751
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:01,170
I can kill him.

752
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:02,110
Woo!

753
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:03,110
What's he gonna do?

754
00:32:03,150 --> 00:32:03,630
Kick me?

755
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:05,190
I can't even see!

756
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:05,730
Oh!

757
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:07,450
He has his brother.

758
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:09,030
They were blind.

759
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:11,310
They were genetically disposed...

760
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:14,390
Genetically disposed to be blind.

761
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:18,430
It's fine.

762
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:20,490
English hard.

763
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:22,450
Alright.

764
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:23,190
Let's see.

765
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:24,930
Poke!

766
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:26,610
Nice.

767
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:29,030
Guys.

768
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:31,870
As long as you understand what I'm saying that's all that matters.

769
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:36,290
I might not be saying it correctly.

770
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:37,590
But you understood.

771
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:41,820
Alright.

772
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:42,280
Let's see.

773
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:43,300
Forward we go.

774
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:45,360
There's so many of these guys.

775
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:47,480
Like.

776
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,340
Why are they guarding this area?

777
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:49,820
Oh!

778
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:50,160
Shit!

779
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:51,300
Alright.

780
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:51,800
Don't worry.

781
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:52,240
I got this.

782
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,420
Come on!

783
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,000
Get out of here!

784
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,960
I need to finish Chapter 3!

785
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,000
If it's the last thing I do.

786
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,520
I just need to finish Chapter 3.

787
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,340
I've been stuck in this chapter for so long.

788
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:06,960
Please.

789
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:10,980
I just wanna know what it's like at the end of the tunnel.

790
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:13,900
Alright.

791
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:14,280
Nice.

792
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:14,800
Poke!

793
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:16,800
Alright.

794
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:18,180
Guys.

795
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:21,720
I haven't learned Street Fighter yet.

796
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:23,300
Hahaha!

797
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,220
I just want you guys to know.

798
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,040
Hahaha!

799
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,040
Alright.

800
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:31,880
There you go.

801
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,540
I will eventually!

802
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,800
Just like how I mastered King!

803
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:42,940
I learned King one very late last moment.

804
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:43,820
Hahaha!

805
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,360
It will happen eventually.

806
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:50,920
Alright.

807
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:52,820
Has there been any issues on stream guys?

808
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:54,820
I can't tell I'm very focused.

809
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:58,320
Alright.

810
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:01,800
And so far, that's good to know.

811
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,180
Maybe it's this area.

812
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:06,360
Maybe it's just this area.

813
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:07,100
Hahaha!

814
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,500
And so far so good.

815
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,320
Alright.

816
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:10,880
That's good to know.

817
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:12,080
Oh there he is again!

818
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:15,280
Wait that's not fair!

819
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,040
He's full HP!

820
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,780
That's not fair!

821
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:19,400
That's cheating!

822
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:21,960
I say as I also rest up.

823
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:22,560
Whoa!

824
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:25,980
Okay.

825
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,200
There you go.

826
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:29,460
Yeah!

827
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,400
How can you heal?

828
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:33,080
Guys this is why I heal too.

829
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:35,080
Because I knew he was gonna heal as well.

830
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:36,100
Hahaha!

831
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,860
Yeah but like I'm literally the main character.

832
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:41,740
I should be allowed to heal.

833
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,540
He's not the main character.

834
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:46,880
He doesn't even have a game base off him.

835
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,700
Oh no I'm frozen.

836
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,480
Oh I'm so slow!

837
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,000
Wow!

838
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:54,180
Oh no.

839
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:54,680
Oh no.

840
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:55,800
That's fine.

841
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:56,300
That's fine.

842
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:57,640
Oh no.

843
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,020
Oh no!

844
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,260
I'm recharging as much as I can!

845
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:01,920
Oh!

846
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,900
Please let me poke you!

847
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,240
It's not fair!

848
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:09,160
Oh shit.

849
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:09,500
Okay.

850
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,200
Heal.

851
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:11,240
Heal.

852
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:11,480
Heal.

853
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:11,600
Heal.

854
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:13,100
That's fine.

855
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,160
That's fine.

856
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,100
I poked him a little bit.

857
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:16,660
That's fine.

858
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:17,880
That's fine.

859
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:20,160
The moment I'm out of this, it's over for you!

860
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:21,820
What?!

861
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,880
What the fuck is this

862
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:30,130
thing?!

863
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:31,450
What the fuck is this thing?!

864
00:35:31,450 --> 00:35:31,510
What the fuck is this thing?!

865
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:32,110
Is that poison?

866
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:33,490
What is he doing?

867
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:35,610
That's it.

868
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:37,270
No more Mr. Nice Monkey.

869
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:37,970
Wait.

870
00:35:38,350 --> 00:35:39,850
No more Mr. Nice Monkey.

871
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:41,150
That's fucking right.

872
00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:41,990
There we go.

873
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:44,190
GO OTHER MONKEYS!

874
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:44,470
GO!

875
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:47,970
GO OTHER MONKEYS!

876
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:47,970
GO!

877
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:47,970
Please!

878
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:49,010
He's right there!

879
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:49,950
Just hit him!

880
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:50,850
Please!

881
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:52,470
Please!

882
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:53,430
Just hit him!

883
00:35:53,450 --> 00:35:55,310
Oh god.

884
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:56,870
Please!

885
00:35:57,870 --> 00:35:59,230
Just hit him!

886
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:01,390
Other me's!

887
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:06,070
He's so low!

888
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:07,230
Oh god.

889
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:08,210
Okay.

890
00:36:09,790 --> 00:36:10,610
That's fine.

891
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:13,210
I'm gonna be greedy!

892
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:15,190
I'm gonna be greedy!

893
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:17,690
I'm gonna be greedy.

894
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:18,750
I'm gonna be- YES!

895
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:21,610
Yes.

896
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:25,550
Greed has won yet again!

897
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:28,530
That's right!

898
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:29,610
That's right!

899
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:31,810
I have greeded!

900
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:33,190
I have greeded!

901
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:35,790
I knew greed would always work.

902
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:37,970
I knew greed would always work.

903
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:39,530
Blood of the Iron- Oh!

904
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:42,570
Is he like one of the the general people?

905
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:44,090
Non-white.

906
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:44,390
Okay.

907
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:45,530
What does that do?

908
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:47,710
Alright.

909
00:36:49,330 --> 00:36:50,530
Time to meditate.

910
00:36:57,390 --> 00:36:59,790
I hope my PC doesn't explode.

911
00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:02,250
I hope my PC doesn't explode.

912
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:04,950
That's all I want.

913
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:07,470
Really it.

914
00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:09,730
I only want one thing.

915
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:15,310
I still don't know what happened.

916
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:17,650
I don't know what happened.

917
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:21,790
Everything was okay until the crash of 24.

918
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:25,530
I never had a chance to fight it.

919
00:37:25,530 --> 00:37:26,350
Zero issues.

920
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:29,870
And then that one crash destroyed everything.

921
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:31,990
Like, what happened?

922
00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:37,170
I still don't understand.

923
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:41,210
I don't understand what happened.

924
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:45,650
Everything was good until that one... that day.

925
00:37:46,090 --> 00:37:48,490
It just stopped being good.

926
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:53,130
Oh my god.

927
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:55,890
It just stopped.

928
00:37:56,010 --> 00:37:58,010
Just stopped all of a sudden.

929
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:01,670
Like, we had zero issues before.

930
00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:04,690
How did it just suddenly stop?

931
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:10,190
Alright, hero's life.

932
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:12,770
Oh hey, him again.

933
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:14,490
Didn't I already beat him up before?

934
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:18,290
Val?

935
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:19,310
You have S to C.

936
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:20,010
Okay.

937
00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:23,830
Down I go.

938
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:26,610
Down down down I go.

939
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:30,830
The PC lived in peace until they crashed into the cat.

940
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:32,430
Thank you for the super chat.

941
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:32,930
Thank you.

942
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:33,570
Thank you.

943
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:34,550
Orin.

944
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:36,090
I'll never know what happened.

945
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:38,610
Like, I wasn't lagging.

946
00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:41,330
Everybody was having a good time.

947
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:45,330
And then... and then suddenly... suddenly?

948
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:47,410
It just stopped?

949
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:47,810
Stopped?

950
00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:53,810
Ever since the tiger, nothing has worked.

951
00:38:58,450 --> 00:39:00,910
Let's go grab the shrine first before we do anything.

952
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:08,430
I need like $45,000 to upgrade my staff.

953
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:14,790
Alright, let's see.

954
00:39:15,050 --> 00:39:16,030
Maybe I can now.

955
00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:17,410
How much money do I have?

956
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:19,870
Oh, I do not.

957
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:21,510
What is the last question mark?

958
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:22,610
How do I even get that?

959
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:27,570
There's like a final question mark there, but I don't know how to get that.

960
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:30,290
Oh yeah, rest.

961
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:34,630
Oh, it's in Chapter 4?

962
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:35,650
God damn it.

963
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:36,990
I'm saving money for no reason.

964
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:41,190
Okay, let's go to the little hole first.

965
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:43,550
I don't know what the hole has.

966
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:46,610
Let me go into the hole.

967
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:49,250
That's the goal.

968
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:52,190
It's not unlocked yet?

969
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:52,470
Okay.

970
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:54,850
I thought it was like I need to find the area too.

971
00:39:57,790 --> 00:39:58,270
Alright.

972
00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:00,410
Wait, what the fuck?!

973
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:03,070
Where did you-

974
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:06,790
Bro!

975
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:09,710
Where the fuck did you come from?!

976
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:14,430
Oh my god, literally out of nowhere.

977
00:40:14,730 --> 00:40:17,390
I was just like minding my own business.

978
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:18,370
Like, oh, that seems...

979
00:40:18,370 --> 00:40:20,230
I wonder where this hole takes me.

980
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:22,790
This hole took me to a fucking boss fight.

981
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:24,950
Oh shit.

982
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:25,710
Oh no.

983
00:40:25,810 --> 00:40:26,470
Oh no.

984
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:27,570
Oh no.

985
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:28,970
Gotta heal.

986
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:29,610
Gotta heal.

987
00:40:30,530 --> 00:40:31,590
That's right, get closer.

988
00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:32,850
Oh!

989
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:34,330
Okay, not like that.

990
00:40:34,490 --> 00:40:35,610
Not like that.

991
00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:37,810
Not like that, Mr. Frog!

992
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:38,750
Oh!

993
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:39,390
No!

994
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:40,090
No!

995
00:40:40,090 --> 00:40:41,470
Please don't pour me!

996
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:42,610
Please!

997
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:46,650
Oh no!

998
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:49,630
Please Mr. Frog!

999
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:51,350
Oh Mr. Frog.

1000
00:40:54,090 --> 00:40:55,530

00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:00,900

1002
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,680
It is!

1003
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:04,400
It's Mr. Frog!

1004
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:11,180
Oh my god, Mr. Frogs game!

1005
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:37,340

1006
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,600
It's understandable.

1007
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:44,120
There we go.

1008
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:44,980
Did I hit him?

1009
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:45,920
I can't tell.

1010
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:48,220
I can't tell sometimes.

1011
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,340
Okay.

1012
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:51,480
FIRE!

1013
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:52,920
FIRE!

1014
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:54,080
FIRE!

1015
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,280
Oh my god.

1016
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:56,200
FIRE!

1017
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:57,580
Oh please.

1018
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:58,940
FIRE!

1019
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:00,080
FIRE!

1020
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:01,580
FIRE!

1021
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:02,700
FIRE!

1022
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,100
Alright, that's enough fire for the day.

1023
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:05,700
Oh shit!

1024
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:06,000
No!

1025
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,100
Okay, that's fine.

1026
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:09,500
That's fine.

1027
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:10,760
Okay.

1028
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:12,320
Can't be that bad.

1029
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,020
Okay, it can be.

1030
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,520
Bro, what the fuck are his moves?

1031
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:18,960
What can I do?

1032
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:19,880
What can I do?

1033
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,180
What can I do?

1034
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:22,240
He just...

1035
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:29,740
What can he... What are the fuck are his attacks?

1036
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:32,080
Like, what do you do?

1037
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,960
Bro, his AOE is an entire fucking map.

1038
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:43,680
His AOE... Oh my god.

1039
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:46,540
His AOE is a fucking entire map.

1040
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:47,700
That's not fair.

1041
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:53,720
I don't even have that big of an AOE.

1042
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:55,400
Okay.

1043
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:58,920
Alright, here we go.

1044
00:42:58,960 --> 00:42:59,420
This is it.

1045
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:01,280
Jimmy, thank you for the super chat.

1046
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:01,620
Thank you.

1047
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:02,340
Thank you.

1048
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:03,580
Oh my gosh, wait.

1049
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:05,800
Sorry, I couldn't see what you said.

1050
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:07,220
Ancient Lurker here.

1051
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:08,400
You reminded me of how...

1052
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,960
Haruka from FLCL a lot.

1053
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,400
Recommended anime you haven't seen.

1054
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:12,200
Thank you for the super chat.

1055
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:12,560
Thank you.

1056
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,780
I have not seen a lot of anime in a while.

1057
00:43:20,590 --> 00:43:21,770
Bro, fuck this frog.

1058
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:23,550
But like, don't fuck the frog.

1059
00:43:23,870 --> 00:43:25,350
But like, fuck this frog, though.

1060
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:26,950
Like, actually.

1061
00:43:27,290 --> 00:43:28,850
I'm so mad, bro.

1062
00:43:28,910 --> 00:43:29,650
This frog...

1063
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:33,450
This frog is like, difficult for no reason.

1064
00:43:35,090 --> 00:43:36,190
Like, I don't understand.

1065
00:43:36,310 --> 00:43:38,210
What is wrong with his AOE?

1066
00:43:39,030 --> 00:43:41,150
Like, he... he is like...

1067
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:43,910
Okay, that's fucking... I'm gonna fucking use this.

1068
00:43:44,370 --> 00:43:45,030
That's fucking right.

1069
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:46,230
Smack!

1070
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:47,470
Oh god.

1071
00:43:47,970 --> 00:43:48,750
That's fucking right.

1072
00:43:48,850 --> 00:43:51,410
I will use the stick if it's the last thing I'll do.

1073
00:43:52,070 --> 00:43:52,730
That's right.

1074
00:43:53,070 --> 00:43:53,970
That's fucking right.

1075
00:43:54,010 --> 00:43:54,590
You can't hit me.

1076
00:43:54,690 --> 00:43:56,670
Oh my god, he hit me.

1077
00:43:57,110 --> 00:43:57,550
Smack!

1078
00:43:57,890 --> 00:43:58,790
Oh, wait.

1079
00:43:58,890 --> 00:43:59,750
He hits me here?

1080
00:44:00,490 --> 00:44:00,930
What?

1081
00:44:04,330 --> 00:44:05,490
Please, let me out.

1082
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:05,990
Please.

1083
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:07,150
Please.

1084
00:44:07,150 --> 00:44:09,090
Please, this is not fair.

1085
00:44:09,470 --> 00:44:10,110
No!

1086
00:44:10,870 --> 00:44:12,810
It's not fair.

1087
00:44:14,910 --> 00:44:17,150
Why is he so strong?

1088
00:44:18,490 --> 00:44:20,430
It's not fair.

1089
00:44:21,890 --> 00:44:23,550
Why is he...

1090
00:44:25,210 --> 00:44:27,030
It's cause he's a billionaire.

1091
00:44:27,270 --> 00:44:29,150
Mr. Frog has so much money.

1092
00:44:29,390 --> 00:44:31,710
He can do whatever the fuck he wants.

1093
00:44:33,730 --> 00:44:35,990
Like, it doesn't matter what he does.

1094
00:44:35,990 --> 00:44:37,850
People would still vote for him for president.

1095
00:44:37,930 --> 00:44:38,730
Even if he...

1096
00:44:38,730 --> 00:44:40,430
If he eats a monkey.

1097
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:43,830
I mean, if he wasn't eating me, I'd vote for him for president too.

1098
00:44:46,130 --> 00:44:47,890
Oh my god, bro.

1099
00:44:47,990 --> 00:44:50,450
This guy is so fucking strong.

1100
00:44:52,210 --> 00:44:53,890
What is your weakness?

1101
00:44:55,050 --> 00:44:55,590
Okay.

1102
00:44:56,770 --> 00:44:57,310
Damn!

1103
00:44:57,550 --> 00:44:57,890
Okay.

1104
00:44:59,430 --> 00:44:59,970
Smack.

1105
00:45:01,350 --> 00:45:02,250
Big baby.

1106
00:45:03,490 --> 00:45:04,030
Fire!

1107
00:45:04,590 --> 00:45:04,990
No!

1108
00:45:04,990 --> 00:45:07,190
His weakness is dead.

1109
00:45:09,110 --> 00:45:13,230
Like, his fucking moves are actually crazy.

1110
00:45:15,790 --> 00:45:17,730
Like, what the fuck is that?

1111
00:45:19,690 --> 00:45:21,550
He's just trying to smack me!

1112
00:45:21,910 --> 00:45:23,410
In the back!

1113
00:45:24,730 --> 00:45:25,950
Okay, that's fine.

1114
00:45:26,070 --> 00:45:26,730
That doesn't hit me.

1115
00:45:27,230 --> 00:45:30,070
That... I... I swear to fucking god.

1116
00:45:30,790 --> 00:45:31,550
Oh!

1117
00:45:31,550 --> 00:45:34,130
I'm trying to heal!

1118
00:45:35,730 --> 00:45:38,390
Oh my god!

1119
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:40,570
I'm just trying to heal!

1120
00:45:40,610 --> 00:45:41,230
Please!

1121
00:45:41,230 --> 00:45:42,390
Have mercy!

1122
00:45:44,530 --> 00:45:45,150
Please!

1123
00:45:45,150 --> 00:45:47,430
Have mercy on me!

1124
00:45:48,390 --> 00:45:50,110
Oh my god!

1125
00:45:50,210 --> 00:45:51,870
This AOE is insane!

1126
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:55,830
This AOE is actually crazy!

1127
00:45:56,890 --> 00:45:57,530
No!

1128
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:04,300
No!

1129
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:05,500
There's no way!

1130
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:09,420
There's no way you eat me after that!

1131
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:12,900
There's no fucking way!

1132
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:15,540
This stupid frog!

1133
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,640
Oh my god!

1134
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:20,980
Oh my god!

1135
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,360
This stupid fucking frog!

1136
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:25,080
I will throw!

1137
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:25,840
Oh my god!

1138
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:26,340
No!

1139
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:27,600
Oh!

1140
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:28,500
Oh!

1141
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:30,360
Oh my god!

1142
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:30,740
Please!

1143
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:32,920
Let me off!

1144
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:34,060
Thank you!

1145
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:36,600
I'm 1 HP!

1146
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:39,540
I'm actually 1 HP!

1147
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:43,160
What the fuck was that frog?!

1148
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:46,000
Oh my god!

1149
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:49,840
That has to be the hardest boss I fought so far!

1150
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:53,220
Like, what the fuck was wrong with him?!

1151
00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:55,020
But I did it!

1152
00:46:55,860 --> 00:46:57,460
I was actually 1 HP.

1153
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:58,340
That was insane!

1154
00:46:58,340 --> 00:46:58,540
That's insane.

1155
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:01,100
I literally had no more HP for that fight.

1156
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:04,620
Goddamn, Mr. Frog.

1157
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:09,140
Don't fuck the frog while playing a monkey.

1158
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:09,900
No!

1159
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:11,320
Lali, stop!

1160
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:12,600
Stop!

1161
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:14,360
Stop!

1162
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:19,320
It's not what I meant.

1163
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:20,200
No!

1164
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:23,980
Oh shit.

1165
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:25,320
Guys, I learned a new move.

1166
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:26,580
It only took me three chapters.

1167
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:31,160
Boom!

1168
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:33,600
Okay, bye.

1169
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:34,880
Goodbye.

1170
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:37,440
Good fucking bye.

1171
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:40,980
Okay, down I'll go.

1172
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:43,920
There must be something down here, right?

1173
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,300
Like, why else would I have to go downstairs?

1174
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:49,200
Alright, nice.

1175
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:52,260
Nice, willpower.

1176
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:55,620
There has to be something down here, right?

1177
00:47:55,660 --> 00:47:58,140
Why else would there be a downstairs portion?

1178
00:47:58,940 --> 00:48:00,360
Like, is he evil?

1179
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:02,580
Guys, he looks evil.

1180
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:05,560
Oh shit!

1181
00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:08,020
Oh, you tried to surprise me?

1182
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:10,660
I heard you a mile away, man bat.

1183
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:13,660
Oh, regular bat bat?

1184
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:14,940
Sorry, you're just bat bat.

1185
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:17,120
Wait, there's another...

1186
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:19,260
Where am I?

1187
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:20,720
Where...

1188
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:23,960
I already unlocked a new shrine.

1189
00:48:24,020 --> 00:48:24,780
Where am I?

1190
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:26,800
How do I unlock a new shrine?

1191
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:28,740
Where the fuck am I?

1192
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:31,800
There.

1193
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:37,540
Oh my god.

1194
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:39,640
I'm already here, but where is here?

1195
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:41,920
How did I get here?

1196
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:47,180
I think I was not supposed to...

1197
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:47,920
Oh my god.

1198
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:49,260
Where am I?

1199
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:52,360
I'm pretty sure, like...

1200
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:55,740
I was supposed to come down from this direction or something.

1201
00:48:55,860 --> 00:48:56,160
Yeah.

1202
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:59,400
Yeah, I was supposed to come down from here.

1203
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:01,020
Because, like, there is a bridge here.

1204
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:02,700
How did I get here?

1205
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:07,740
Guys...

1206
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:08,540
Wow!

1207
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:10,180
What the fuck?

1208
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,040
Where did you come from?

1209
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:13,840
Get down from here.

1210
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:14,920
Get down.

1211
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:18,160
That's fucking right.

1212
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:20,160
You didn't surprise me this time.

1213
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:21,560
So predictable.

1214
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:23,660
Alright.

1215
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:26,100
Over you all go.

1216
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:28,540
Oh!

1217
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:30,640
Oh, is he dead?

1218
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:31,720
Where did his body go?

1219
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:32,880
Oh my god.

1220
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:33,580
I killed this man.

1221
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:35,920
Don't worry.

1222
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:36,660
He doesn't know.

1223
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:39,760
He doesn't know.

1224
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:40,900
Easy.

1225
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:43,100
Wait.

1226
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:43,980
Are you alive still?

1227
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:44,420
No.

1228
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:45,660
Wait.

1229
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:46,100
What?

1230
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:47,660
You're still alive?

1231
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:48,220
Okay.

1232
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:49,400
Alright.

1233
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:50,200
Now he's dead.

1234
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:50,960
Dead for real.

1235
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:53,000
I...

1236
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:53,440
Okay.

1237
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:55,160
So that's where I came from.

1238
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:57,340
Does that mean there's stuff here?

1239
00:49:57,860 --> 00:49:59,500
There might be stuff here, actually.

1240
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:03,980
Okay.

1241
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:06,020
Oh, there might be stuff down here.

1242
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:06,680
There's another hole.

1243
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:11,480
Must find the goal.

1244
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:14,740
Oh my god.

1245
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:16,620
Where is the goal?

1246
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:17,580
Where?

1247
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:21,320
There's so many holes.

1248
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:23,300
Which one is the real goal?

1249
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:26,180
The goal.

1250
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:28,560
Alright.

1251
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:30,180
Here?

1252
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:32,380
Are you the goal?

1253
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:36,840
What the fuck?

1254
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:38,200
Is it here?

1255
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:40,500
Is this the goal?

1256
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:43,200
No, what the fuck?

1257
00:50:43,220 --> 00:50:44,720
There's still frog people here?

1258
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:46,460
You killed your king!

1259
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:47,460
I killed Mr. Frog!

1260
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:49,400
Are you still here?

1261
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:50,720
Okay, poison?

1262
00:50:50,860 --> 00:50:51,300
No, I didn't.

1263
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:51,580
Okay.

1264
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:52,720
Nice.

1265
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:55,800
Every hole is the goal, Doki.

1266
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:56,640
What do you mean?

1267
00:50:58,040 --> 00:50:58,600
Nice.

1268
00:50:58,600 --> 00:50:59,580
Alright, tree pro.

1269
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:05,720
That might be overkill.

1270
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:08,600
Okay, there's a frog here.

1271
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:10,420
Where am I?

1272
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Like at...

1273
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,300
What is he doing?

1274
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:14,900
What are you doing?

1275
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:17,060
Why are you just hitting your gun?

1276
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:19,380
Oh, he woke them up!

1277
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:22,480
Through...

1278
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:23,500
Is he a monkey?

1279
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:25,820
Oh no, that's...

1280
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:26,900
What did I kill?

1281
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:29,380
What the fuck did I...

1282
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:30,620
I'm...

1283
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:32,440
Is it a monkey?

1284
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:34,900
You're a monkey?

1285
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:38,720
You do not look like a monkey.

1286
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:41,920
Okay.

1287
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:45,140
Wow!

1288
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:47,380
Okay, that was...

1289
00:51:47,380 --> 00:51:48,540
Are you fucking...

1290
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:50,380
Holy fuck!

1291
00:51:51,060 --> 00:51:52,100
Holy fuck!

1292
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:53,400
You know what?

1293
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:55,680
Who can play that game?

1294
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:57,000
Go, monkeys, go!

1295
00:51:57,340 --> 00:51:58,740
Do your thing, monkeys!

1296
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:02,840
I got the big guy!

1297
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:06,160
You get all the smaller guys!

1298
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:08,600
Alright, nice.

1299
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:11,720
Nice, they all got the smaller guys.

1300
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:12,860
I got the big ones.

1301
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:15,180
They are confused.

1302
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:16,380
Monkey confused.

1303
00:52:16,860 --> 00:52:17,900
We did it, monkeys!

1304
00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:20,900
Oh, together now!

1305
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:24,200
The whole neighborhood showed up.

1306
00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:27,000
Oh, there's him again!

1307
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:30,040
That's the medicine guy.

1308
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:31,600
That we saved earlier.

1309
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:34,000
Monkeys together strong.

1310
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:35,480
Hello!

1311
00:52:38,340 --> 00:52:39,060
Hello!

1312
00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:40,740
Yeah, no shit.

1313
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:41,860
It's the fucking mountains!

1314
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:43,700
Oh!

1315
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:44,540
You need fire?

1316
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:46,220
I got you.

1317
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:47,140
I got you!

1318
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:47,880
I got you!

1319
00:52:50,980 --> 00:52:53,200
Oh no, I don't got you.

1320
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:54,500
Give me a sec.

1321
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:55,640
I'm trying to find the shrine.

1322
00:52:56,060 --> 00:52:57,080
Give me a sec.

1323
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:59,180
I'm still trying to find the shrine!

1324
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:01,480
Where the fuck is the shrine?

1325
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:02,760
Coke!

1326
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:05,700
Oh shit, where did you come from?

1327
00:53:07,180 --> 00:53:07,800
Oh no!

1328
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:10,400
Here we go.

1329
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:12,700
I know!

1330
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:13,960
Okay, I'm trying to figure...

1331
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:14,420
Oh, there it is.

1332
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:15,160
Wait, that's not fair!

1333
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:16,620
They like guarded the shrine.

1334
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:19,380
Yeah, but...

1335
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:21,540
I didn't expect monsters to be at the shrine.

1336
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:23,380
Usually, they're never at the shrine.

1337
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:26,320
Okay, uh... spells.

1338
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:28,880
Which one is it?

1339
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:29,440
Here you go.

1340
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:30,240
Ring of Fire.

1341
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:32,780
Alright, just for you, my dude.

1342
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:39,720
That's right, you're very special because you get your very own Ring of Fire.

1343
00:53:42,020 --> 00:53:42,460
Fire!

1344
00:53:47,860 --> 00:53:50,240
Maybe you should have worn pants, old man.

1345
00:53:56,370 --> 00:53:59,150
You should have worn some pants, dude.

1346
00:54:02,210 --> 00:54:05,330
Like, after the Ring of Fire is over, you still have to go through the...

1347
00:54:05,330 --> 00:54:07,730
How did you get up here in the first place?

1348
00:54:09,570 --> 00:54:11,070
Yeah, wear some shoes, old man.

1349
00:54:16,210 --> 00:54:19,450
Watermel... Does this look like a place for watermelons right now?

1350
00:54:23,270 --> 00:54:25,110
He says that he says that he says that he says that.

1351
00:54:30,590 --> 00:54:31,710
Is that it?

1352
00:54:35,770 --> 00:54:38,870
Oh my god, it's because he's magic!

1353
00:54:40,570 --> 00:54:41,050
Yeah.

1354
00:54:42,090 --> 00:54:42,570
Yeah.

1355
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:43,130
Yeah.

1356
00:54:43,130 --> 00:54:43,530
Yeah.

1357
00:54:44,410 --> 00:54:44,670
Yeah.

1358
00:54:45,010 --> 00:54:45,490
Yeah.

1359
00:54:46,190 --> 00:54:46,310
Yeah.

1360
00:54:46,390 --> 00:54:46,610
Yeah.

1361
00:54:46,610 --> 00:54:46,830
Yeah.

1362
00:54:46,930 --> 00:54:47,030
Yeah.

1363
00:54:47,830 --> 00:54:47,910
Yeah.

1364
00:54:48,090 --> 00:54:48,230
Yeah.

1365
00:54:48,230 --> 00:54:49,190
What if it's a tube or something?

1366
00:54:49,710 --> 00:54:52,010
Hey, look at the watermelons over there.

1367
00:54:52,030 --> 00:54:52,470
They're already eaten.

1368
00:54:54,810 --> 00:54:59,590
So the watermelons can't be eaten?

1369
00:54:59,890 --> 00:55:01,490
It's a cube?

1370
00:55:02,710 --> 00:55:03,710
There's no cube?

1371
00:55:03,950 --> 00:55:07,090
No, there's not a cube.

1372
00:55:07,530 --> 00:55:08,710
What is it?

1373
00:55:08,730 --> 00:55:09,270
You're running out of time.

1374
00:55:10,070 --> 00:55:10,890
What's wrong?

1375
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:11,110
The computer says the computer's weak.

1376
00:55:11,870 --> 00:55:12,550
What's wrong?

1377
00:55:15,170 --> 00:55:16,150
There are no computers in this area.

1378
00:55:16,570 --> 00:55:18,210
The only thing that works is to cast a spell.

1379
00:55:39,460 --> 00:55:40,880
Sorry, I was blowing my nose.

1380
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:45,580
I guess he would be gone when I set up the immobilize.

1381
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:46,440
Is he gone now?

1382
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:48,400
Oh, he's gone.

1383
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:49,760
But he is gone.

1384
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:50,700
What the fuck?

1385
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:51,440
That's all it took?

1386
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:52,160
He's better now?

1387
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:54,340
Well, I guess he's okay now, I guess.

1388
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:59,120
I guess that's all it took to be okay.

1389
00:56:00,140 --> 00:56:02,100
Literally, just a little fire magic.

1390
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:04,200
Alright.

1391
00:56:04,660 --> 00:56:06,100
Yes, of course I'm muted.

1392
00:56:08,620 --> 00:56:12,400
Only tier 20 memberships can hear the sneeze.

1393
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:17,880
If I let you guys hear it, it won't be fair to the people who pay tier 20.

1394
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:25,940
Say the price?

1395
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:29,340
If you're wondering the price, that means you couldn't afford the tier 20.

1396
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:31,980
The people who...

1397
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:36,480
The people who could afford tier 20 are already...

1398
00:56:37,860 --> 00:56:39,440
are already in it.

1399
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:46,020
Folk!

1400
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:47,560
Oh, yeah.

1401
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:50,020
Dang.

1402
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:57,580
Alright.

1403
00:56:57,580 --> 00:56:58,660
Let's see.

1404
00:56:59,370 --> 00:57:01,020
Kai, welcome to tomato farm!

1405
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:01,840
Welcome, welcome!

1406
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:06,920
They're like, wait, is this the sneeze in the tomato farm?

1407
00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:13,680
Alright, let's see.

1408
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:15,440
Where do I go?

1409
00:57:15,940 --> 00:57:17,400
Wait, where did I come from?

1410
00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:19,040
Fuck, okay.

1411
00:57:20,460 --> 00:57:21,840
I'll figure this out.

1412
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:26,740
Oh, shit.

1413
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:28,820
Oh my god, I fucking knew it.

1414
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:30,620
I knew it.

1415
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:31,960
It's always this man.

1416
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:36,280
You know what, bro?

1417
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:36,780
Fuck this.

1418
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:37,980
I can't.

1419
00:57:37,980 --> 00:57:38,640
Big baby.

1420
00:57:39,100 --> 00:57:42,320
I... Oh my god, he's so tanky!

1421
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:46,700
Jesus!

1422
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:49,740
How is he so tanky?

1423
00:57:51,220 --> 00:57:53,440
Do I have to use all my magic on you?

1424
00:57:55,020 --> 00:57:57,440
Oh my god, this is like a mini boss fight.

1425
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:00,420
Wait, is this a... Oh, he hits a boss!

1426
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:02,980
I was like... I was like, is he a boss?

1427
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:06,620
Like... Oh, sorry, I just realized he has his own name.

1428
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:08,920
Like... Yeah, I think he...

1429
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:10,660
Whoa, what is he doing?

1430
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:15,440
Okay, I was like, is he gonna just keep growing?

1431
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:18,560
Oh, he did grow!

1432
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:21,260
Over here.

1433
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:23,480
Oh, that's not who I wanted to hit.

1434
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:27,000
I was gonna be like, what the fuck?

1435
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:28,120
Why is he still growing?

1436
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:28,840
Like, what?

1437
00:58:32,980 --> 00:58:33,780
That makes sense.

1438
00:58:34,060 --> 00:58:36,200
I didn't realize he was an actual boss.

1439
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:37,780
I was like, wait, he has a name.

1440
00:58:40,740 --> 00:58:42,800
He has an actual name.

1441
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,600
They've never had names before.

1442
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:49,200
Alright.

1443
00:58:50,180 --> 00:58:50,660
Look.

1444
00:58:51,580 --> 00:58:53,260
Everything eventually has to die.

1445
00:58:53,460 --> 00:58:54,440
It was his time.

1446
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:57,800
It was as prophesized in the Wukong books.

1447
00:58:58,940 --> 00:59:00,560
Tao, thank you for the super chat.

1448
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:01,680
Are you fucking...

1449
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:02,500
Okay.

1450
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:04,040
Okay.

1451
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:06,540
Yeah, this is how they're supposed to look.

1452
00:59:06,620 --> 00:59:08,420
I was like, how the fuck was he so big?

1453
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:11,860
Sorry, I opened with Wraith ult.

1454
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:13,400
Last Apex I played is Apex.

1455
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:14,920
Oh my... That is a long time.

1456
00:59:15,740 --> 00:59:16,620
Apex Mobile.

1457
00:59:17,340 --> 00:59:19,400
That game doesn't even exist anymore.

1458
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:22,200
But yes, thank you for the super chat.

1459
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:23,060
Thank you, thank you.

1460
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:25,460
What is this?

1461
00:59:25,940 --> 00:59:26,860
Is this a watermelon?

1462
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:30,240
No, that's a Jadus.

1463
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:30,920
Yes, Essence.

1464
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:32,840
Alright.

1465
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:34,820
Where do I go?

1466
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:37,960
I guess I go up?

1467
00:59:39,620 --> 00:59:42,780
I wonder how many more bosses I have left in general.

1468
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:45,660
I guess I'll go up.

1469
00:59:45,660 --> 00:59:47,660
I think I went everywhere down, right?

1470
00:59:48,820 --> 00:59:50,820
Like, I don't even know where I am anymore.

1471
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:52,480
I've actually lost track.

1472
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:57,960
I legitimately lost track as to where I am in this game.

1473
00:59:59,660 --> 01:00:00,220
I've actually lost track as to where I am in this game.

1474
01:00:00,220 --> 01:00:02,400
I just hope that I'm at the right area.

1475
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:03,900
I just hope that I'm at the right area.

1476
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:04,980
Find a treasure?

1477
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:06,400
Where could the treasure be?

1478
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:07,000
Where could the treasure be?

1479
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:07,500
Where could the treasure be?

1480
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:08,480
Okay.

1481
01:00:09,900 --> 01:00:11,840
Am I heading to the right area for the treasure?

1482
01:00:15,060 --> 01:00:15,540
Hello?

1483
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:16,600
How do you hear me?

1484
01:00:16,620 --> 01:00:17,000
You're blind!

1485
01:00:19,260 --> 01:00:20,020
Not fair!

1486
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:23,000
Sorry.

1487
01:00:23,220 --> 01:00:23,700
Bam!

1488
01:00:24,580 --> 01:00:25,580
Oh my god, Doki.

1489
01:00:25,660 --> 01:00:26,420
That's fucked up.

1490
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:27,400
Beating up a blind person?

1491
01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:29,880
I'm going to fucking write a tweet longer about you right now.

1492
01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:30,200
I'm going to fucking write a tweet longer about you right now.

1493
01:00:31,380 --> 01:00:33,000
Look, it was self-defense.

1494
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:36,040
Being blind doesn't mean I can't hit back.

1495
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:39,840
He is not dead.

1496
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:45,760
If I get hit by a blind person, I will self-defend myself.

1497
01:00:48,700 --> 01:00:52,800
Like, it does not exempt you.

1498
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:53,720
You still hit somebody.

1499
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:57,700
Is it down here?

1500
01:00:57,900 --> 01:00:58,540
Is this a cliff?

1501
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:00,840
I don't want to jump.

1502
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:01,320
I'm scared.

1503
01:01:03,340 --> 01:01:05,000
I'm scared I'm going to get punished for that.

1504
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:08,360
Okay.

1505
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:09,160
What the fuck?

1506
01:01:10,860 --> 01:01:11,760
Did I reach it?

1507
01:01:11,860 --> 01:01:12,280
Oh, I do.

1508
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:14,040
Okay.

1509
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:15,740
Oh my god, it's him again.

1510
01:01:15,940 --> 01:01:16,900
It's the flying guys.

1511
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:19,500
Oh shit!

1512
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:20,440
What the?

1513
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:21,480
That dodged it?

1514
01:01:21,580 --> 01:01:23,320
I can't even tell if I dodged that.

1515
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:27,920
They won't see it coming.

1516
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:29,100
Hahaha.

1517
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:31,080
Exactly.

1518
01:01:31,180 --> 01:01:32,020
How would they know?

1519
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:32,640
They're flying.

1520
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:36,960
Alright.

1521
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:37,640
Nice.

1522
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:39,200
I got something.

1523
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:40,260
I don't know what I got.

1524
01:01:44,180 --> 01:01:46,160
Yeah, I was like, did I dodge it?

1525
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:49,240
I thought I immobilized, but it shows that I dodged.

1526
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:50,100
So I was like confused.

1527
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:55,720
Oh, it's a perfect dodge using immobilize?

1528
01:01:56,040 --> 01:01:56,700
Yeah, planned.

1529
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:00,440
Whoa.

1530
01:02:01,060 --> 01:02:01,580
Wolves?

1531
01:02:01,660 --> 01:02:02,220
You're silly.

1532
01:02:02,420 --> 01:02:02,920
Whoa!

1533
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:04,300
Wolves with knives?

1534
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:08,300
Oh god, they're twins.

1535
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:11,880
For now.

1536
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:14,680
Whoa!

1537
01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:16,700
Who gave these wolves knives?

1538
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:20,880
Yeah, I can't fucking do your fancy.

1539
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:21,640
Oh shit.

1540
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:22,360
Maybe you can.

1541
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:23,040
You know what?

1542
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:23,840
Say baby.

1543
01:02:24,100 --> 01:02:24,800
That's right.

1544
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:26,360
Now you're not a twin anymore.

1545
01:02:27,060 --> 01:02:27,580
Hahaha.

1546
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:30,420
No more twins for me.

1547
01:02:30,420 --> 01:02:30,560
For you.

1548
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:34,720
Now your mother is going to have two funerals.

1549
01:02:35,580 --> 01:02:36,660
That's fucking right.

1550
01:02:36,820 --> 01:02:37,740
Get out of here.

1551
01:02:39,300 --> 01:02:40,720
Get the fuck out of here.

1552
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:43,320
This is Wukan land.

1553
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:45,900
Oh, he's praying.

1554
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:46,440
That's sweet.

1555
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:49,160
At least you'll be there with him.

1556
01:02:50,940 --> 01:02:52,160
Look, I was just being nice.

1557
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:53,420
I was like taking him.

1558
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:56,260
I was taking him to whoever he was praying to.

1559
01:02:58,220 --> 01:02:59,080
There's a corpse?

1560
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:00,400
I don't know.

1561
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:01,540
What the fuck is that?

1562
01:03:03,420 --> 01:03:03,980
Evil?

1563
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:05,440
Oh shit.

1564
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:06,080
I have to hit his foot.

1565
01:03:06,660 --> 01:03:07,220
Okay.

1566
01:03:09,060 --> 01:03:09,920
Free time?

1567
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:10,740
I guess?

1568
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:11,940
Alright.

1569
01:03:12,100 --> 01:03:12,600
Hahaha.

1570
01:03:15,580 --> 01:03:16,140
Okay.

1571
01:03:16,540 --> 01:03:17,020
Hahaha.

1572
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:19,460
Alright.

1573
01:03:19,580 --> 01:03:20,000
Don't worry.

1574
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:20,400
Wait.

1575
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:21,100
Does he respawn?

1576
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:23,480
Oh my god.

1577
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:24,280
Big baby.

1578
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:24,880
This was...

1579
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:25,740
Remember him?

1580
01:03:25,860 --> 01:03:26,780
This was big baby.

1581
01:03:26,940 --> 01:03:28,200
Now he's a teenager.

1582
01:03:28,740 --> 01:03:29,300
Hahaha.

1583
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:29,860
Hahaha.

1584
01:03:29,900 --> 01:03:30,380
Hahaha.

1585
01:03:32,080 --> 01:03:33,080
Remember him?

1586
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:35,120
He's a teenager now, guys.

1587
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:39,240
Jesus Christ.

1588
01:03:39,300 --> 01:03:41,540
He's so fucking tanky.

1589
01:03:44,140 --> 01:03:44,700
Oh.

1590
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:47,720
What the fuck?

1591
01:03:49,180 --> 01:03:50,120
Oh my god.

1592
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:50,700
Are you okay?

1593
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:51,580
Haha.

1594
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:52,840
That's fucking right.

1595
01:03:52,980 --> 01:03:53,860
You deserve this.

1596
01:03:54,220 --> 01:03:55,760
You fucking deserve this.

1597
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:56,780
That's right.

1598
01:03:57,800 --> 01:03:59,300
How dare you grow up?

1599
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:00,000
Hahaha.

1600
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:00,380
Hahaha.

1601
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:02,740
I thought I ended your bloodline?

1602
01:04:03,120 --> 01:04:05,440
How dare you become an adult?

1603
01:04:06,540 --> 01:04:07,180
Whoa.

1604
01:04:07,460 --> 01:04:08,100
Whoa.

1605
01:04:08,260 --> 01:04:08,420
Whoa.

1606
01:04:08,420 --> 01:04:08,620
Whoa.

1607
01:04:08,620 --> 01:04:08,860
Whoa.

1608
01:04:08,860 --> 01:04:09,360
Whoa.

1609
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:09,680
Whoa.

1610
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:13,900
Over-traumatic baby.

1611
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:19,200
Even though he got to grow up mentally, he still hasn't.

1612
01:04:21,100 --> 01:04:21,740
Alright.

1613
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:23,080
Nice.

1614
01:04:23,740 --> 01:04:24,660
What is he?

1615
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:26,080
Wait.

1616
01:04:26,100 --> 01:04:26,660
What was he?

1617
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:28,040
Hahaha.

1618
01:04:28,260 --> 01:04:28,900
Wait.

1619
01:04:29,020 --> 01:04:29,540
What was he?

1620
01:04:29,540 --> 01:04:31,360
Oh no, I can't... I don't know.

1621
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:33,400
Oh no, I lost track.

1622
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:34,480
Is this one?

1623
01:04:35,060 --> 01:04:35,840
Dark face?

1624
01:04:35,980 --> 01:04:36,820
Oh, it has to be him.

1625
01:04:43,580 --> 01:04:44,780
That's fucking right.

1626
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:46,680
Down with all babies.

1627
01:04:47,180 --> 01:04:49,000
What have they done for us anyway?

1628
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:50,040
Like...

1629
01:04:51,780 --> 01:04:52,260
Babies?

1630
01:04:52,260 --> 01:04:52,740
Babies?

1631
01:04:53,260 --> 01:04:59,220
If you guys didn't know, human babies are known as one of the worst babies in the animal kingdom.

1632
01:04:59,220 --> 01:05:02,700
They're like every other baby animal is like...

1633
01:05:03,220 --> 01:05:06,380
When a deer is born, they can...

1634
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:08,820
They can walk.

1635
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:11,140
They can like, you know...

1636
01:05:11,140 --> 01:05:12,700
They can poop without assistance.

1637
01:05:13,340 --> 01:05:13,820
They...

1638
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:18,240
They can technically talk if you think about it.

1639
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:20,700
Like in their language, in their baby language.

1640
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:23,200
Like...

1641
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:26,040
What can fucking human babies do?

1642
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:27,960
Human babies can't even walk.

1643
01:05:28,280 --> 01:05:29,200
They can't even walk.

1644
01:05:29,220 --> 01:05:30,380
They can't do taxes.

1645
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:31,320
Yeah.

1646
01:05:31,880 --> 01:05:34,620
Human babies can't even do their own taxes.

1647
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:35,940
Like, what's the point?

1648
01:05:36,380 --> 01:05:37,220
Oh, shit.

1649
01:05:37,260 --> 01:05:38,240
I was not... I was fucking around.

1650
01:05:39,620 --> 01:05:40,840
They can't even...

1651
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:41,400
Exactly!

1652
01:05:42,020 --> 01:05:44,840
Human babies can't even fucking cough properly.

1653
01:05:44,940 --> 01:05:48,140
We have to smack them in the butt so they can cough.

1654
01:05:49,460 --> 01:05:50,860
So they can burp.

1655
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:56,380
They can burp.

1656
01:05:56,380 --> 01:06:02,800
All I'm saying is that I think human babies are the most worthless babies out of all the babies in the world.

1657
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:07,460
Like, literally any other baby is better than a human baby.

1658
01:06:08,080 --> 01:06:12,300
The only baby that's worse than a human baby is a kangaroo baby.

1659
01:06:12,820 --> 01:06:15,860
Like, kangaroo moms literally don't care.

1660
01:06:17,060 --> 01:06:17,720
They...

1661
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:19,940
How do you guys know this?

1662
01:06:20,860 --> 01:06:22,760
But kangaroo moms really...

1663
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:28,880
Like, the moment the baby is like something, it just comes out.

1664
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:34,440
It's like barely a thing.

1665
01:06:36,980 --> 01:06:38,680
They're just like, get in the pouch.

1666
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:39,540
You live there now.

1667
01:06:42,120 --> 01:06:43,020
Oh, shit.

1668
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:43,640
Unlucky.

1669
01:06:44,420 --> 01:06:46,920
Can you get closer to me while I use this stick?

1670
01:06:47,300 --> 01:06:48,580
And don't throw the thing.

1671
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:49,160
Oh, no.

1672
01:06:49,220 --> 01:06:50,160
He's not gonna...

1673
01:06:50,860 --> 01:06:51,040
He knows.

1674
01:06:51,580 --> 01:06:52,560
You don't fuck this.

1675
01:06:52,860 --> 01:06:55,360
I can't be bothered to deal with your bullshit.

1676
01:06:55,560 --> 01:06:58,240
I can't be bothered.

1677
01:06:58,640 --> 01:06:59,640
You're gonna...

1678
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:02,760
I'm just gonna turn into a big tiger boy.

1679
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:04,740
Alright, nice.

1680
01:07:05,700 --> 01:07:07,060
Okay, I need you guys...

1681
01:07:07,060 --> 01:07:07,960
Baby turtles?

1682
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:09,340
Baby turtles?

1683
01:07:09,620 --> 01:07:10,660
They can fuck...

1684
01:07:10,660 --> 01:07:11,060
I don't know yet.

1685
01:07:11,100 --> 01:07:13,200
Baby turtles can at least like walk.

1686
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:16,860
Human babies can't even crawl.

1687
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:17,540
Chat.

1688
01:07:20,060 --> 01:07:20,660
Okay.

1689
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:22,820
We gotta get rid of him apparently.

1690
01:07:22,980 --> 01:07:23,960
They won't let me...

1691
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:26,840
They won't let me use the shrine until I get rid of this guy.

1692
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:28,320
Which is fucked.

1693
01:07:29,460 --> 01:07:30,380
No, they can't.

1694
01:07:30,380 --> 01:07:32,580
It takes them like certain amount of months to crawl.

1695
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:34,400
They can't even do that.

1696
01:07:36,820 --> 01:07:37,260
Alright.

1697
01:07:38,780 --> 01:07:40,080
Okay, baby turtles?

1698
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:41,560
Baby turtles?

1699
01:07:41,720 --> 01:07:45,480
It's not their fault that like everybody wants to fucking eat a baby turtle.

1700
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:46,400
Like...

1701
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:49,520
Hey, it's not...

1702
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:50,900
It's not their fault.

1703
01:07:50,980 --> 01:07:52,400
Like everybody in the beach...

1704
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,360
Okay, I'll show you guys what a baby kangaroo looks like.

1705
01:07:55,500 --> 01:07:56,880
It's actually pretty fucked.

1706
01:07:58,420 --> 01:07:58,900
Um...

1707
01:07:58,900 --> 01:08:01,560
When they are born, they look like...

1708
01:08:02,060 --> 01:08:03,800
Like they literally...

1709
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:05,600
Let me look at...

1710
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:06,660
Actually, it's pretty disgusting.

1711
01:08:06,820 --> 01:08:07,140
Okay.

1712
01:08:08,780 --> 01:08:09,260
Okay.

1713
01:08:11,240 --> 01:08:13,080
I need to warn you guys.

1714
01:08:13,080 --> 01:08:15,060
I need to know.

1715
01:08:15,180 --> 01:08:16,480
This is literally...

1716
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:19,380
This is how the kangaroo poops the baby out.

1717
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:20,580
It's so fucked.

1718
01:08:20,580 --> 01:08:23,210
It's so fucked.

1719
01:08:24,810 --> 01:08:25,440
This is...

1720
01:08:27,140 --> 01:08:29,440
Bro, it doesn't have any...

1721
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:30,260
It's like a jelly.

1722
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:30,840
It's like...

1723
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:32,840
Alright, get in my pouch now.

1724
01:08:33,160 --> 01:08:34,540
And it lives in the pouch.

1725
01:08:35,680 --> 01:08:36,860
That's literally...

1726
01:08:36,860 --> 01:08:39,540
That's literally what it looks like.

1727
01:08:43,420 --> 01:08:45,060
Yeah, they literally...

1728
01:08:45,060 --> 01:08:47,460
Poop the baby out when it's like...

1729
01:08:47,460 --> 01:08:48,420
A fetus.

1730
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:49,520
And then...

1731
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:50,800
And then they're like...

1732
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:52,860
Crawl into the pouch now.

1733
01:08:56,940 --> 01:08:58,860
That's like the only thing...

1734
01:08:58,860 --> 01:09:00,560
That's worse than a human baby.

1735
01:09:00,900 --> 01:09:02,680
It's literally a...

1736
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:03,840
Kangaroo baby.

1737
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:06,680
A kangaroo baby is like a fetus.

1738
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:11,680
So, wait.

1739
01:09:11,800 --> 01:09:12,480
Um...

1740
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:14,480
Okay, kangaroo...

1741
01:09:15,080 --> 01:09:17,080
Baby kangaroo...

1742
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:19,100
Uh, there's like a...

1743
01:09:19,100 --> 01:09:19,540
Diagram.

1744
01:09:19,700 --> 01:09:20,200
Diagram.

1745
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:22,220
I hate how...

1746
01:09:22,220 --> 01:09:23,740
How they do that.

1747
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:26,960
It's so fucking weird.

1748
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:28,200
I remember when I...

1749
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:31,000
When I like saw it...

1750
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,200
I was like, what the fuck?

1751
01:09:32,580 --> 01:09:34,820
How the fuck is it...

1752
01:09:34,820 --> 01:09:37,040
How the fuck did they decide...

1753
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:38,000
To do that?

1754
01:09:40,620 --> 01:09:41,620
You're right!

1755
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:42,980
Even as a...

1756
01:09:43,080 --> 01:09:43,740
You're right!

1757
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:44,860
No, you're fucking right.

1758
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:45,420
Nevermind.

1759
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:46,180
You're right.

1760
01:09:46,360 --> 01:09:47,980
Human babies are like...

1761
01:09:47,980 --> 01:09:49,500
We fucked up.

1762
01:09:51,360 --> 01:09:53,000
You said we're like...

1763
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,400
Oh Doki, you're spoiling...

1764
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:56,100
Your dog.

1765
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:59,320
We have spoiled babies so fucking hard.

1766
01:09:59,700 --> 01:10:00,840
That like...

1767
01:10:01,640 --> 01:10:02,920
That even...

1768
01:10:02,920 --> 01:10:04,040
A fetus.

1769
01:10:04,040 --> 01:10:06,640
A kangaroo fetus...

1770
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:07,720
Can crawl.

1771
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:11,880
Like it's literally...

1772
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:13,360
Crawling...

1773
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:14,620
To the pouch.

1774
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:18,360
Please...

1775
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:21,440
Please, we don't want to see it.

1776
01:10:21,480 --> 01:10:22,560
Okay, fine.

1777
01:10:22,940 --> 01:10:23,520
Fine!

1778
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:25,240
No education...

1779
01:10:25,240 --> 01:10:26,560
For you, I guess.

1780
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:34,600
Apparently...

1781
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:36,940
Oh wait, I can brew something else.

1782
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:38,840
What's this?

1783
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:39,880
Uh...

1784
01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:44,720
36% And a moderate amount...

1785
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:45,140
Oh, wait!

1786
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:45,920
A mana!

1787
01:10:46,340 --> 01:10:47,180
Wait, that's good.

1788
01:10:47,580 --> 01:10:49,240
I might as well get the mana one too.

1789
01:10:49,820 --> 01:10:51,100
Okay, um...

1790
01:10:51,100 --> 01:10:52,300
Laurel turtle breath.

1791
01:10:52,540 --> 01:10:52,780
Okay.

1792
01:10:53,640 --> 01:10:54,200
Laurel...

1793
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:55,700
What is breath again?

1794
01:10:56,020 --> 01:10:56,880
Which one's breath?

1795
01:10:58,220 --> 01:10:58,780
Uh...

1796
01:11:01,420 --> 01:11:03,880
Oh, I'll get the breath and the laurel beads then.

1797
01:11:04,780 --> 01:11:05,340
Uh...

1798
01:11:05,340 --> 01:11:07,640
Breath and laurel beads.

1799
01:11:08,140 --> 01:11:08,940
Okay, there we go.

1800
01:11:10,240 --> 01:11:11,200
Alright, that's fine.

1801
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:13,100
Alright, apparently I missed something.

1802
01:11:13,240 --> 01:11:13,960
Where do I have to go?

1803
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:15,640
Guys, I missed something.

1804
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:16,440
I missed a boss.

1805
01:11:17,340 --> 01:11:18,220
Where do I have to go?

1806
01:11:23,350 --> 01:11:24,410
Where do I have to go, guys?

1807
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:29,880
Let's see...

1808
01:11:32,980 --> 01:11:35,060
Uh... Oh wait, I only selected one of the soaks?

1809
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:36,060
Okay, give me a sec.

1810
01:11:36,440 --> 01:11:37,140
Oh, I did!

1811
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:38,940
Okay, was it breath, right?

1812
01:11:38,940 --> 01:11:39,660
Yeah, breath.

1813
01:11:40,020 --> 01:11:41,780
Because the other ones fucking suck.

1814
01:11:44,940 --> 01:11:45,460
Uh...

1815
01:11:47,020 --> 01:11:48,920
First chapter of the red...

1816
01:11:48,920 --> 01:11:50,360
Wait, no, we already got...

1817
01:11:50,360 --> 01:11:52,100
We already beat red dragon though.

1818
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:54,920
Forest...

1819
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:56,560
Uh, we already did red dragon.

1820
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:57,680
What am I missing?

1821
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:02,620
Someone said that I'm missing, like...

1822
01:12:02,620 --> 01:12:04,080
Um, something in this area.

1823
01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:07,500
I'm missing a boss in this area.

1824
01:12:08,180 --> 01:12:08,920
I'm missing a boss in this area.

1825
01:12:08,940 --> 01:12:09,660
Thank you for the super chat.

1826
01:12:09,720 --> 01:12:10,580
Thank you, thank you.

1827
01:12:10,660 --> 01:12:15,340
Human babies are hyper-specialized to favor the growth of the most important organ, the brain.

1828
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:17,680
A realtor's capacity was sacrificed for it.

1829
01:12:17,740 --> 01:12:20,280
Babies can still instinctually swim, though.

1830
01:12:20,500 --> 01:12:25,100
Oh yeah, I've seen videos of people just fucking throwing their babies in the water, just for...

1831
01:12:25,100 --> 01:12:26,160
Like, just...

1832
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:28,400
Like, they just...

1833
01:12:28,940 --> 01:12:30,120
They're supposed to be like, see?

1834
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:32,620
We're gonna teach our baby how to fucking swim.

1835
01:12:32,940 --> 01:12:35,020
Like, that's so fucked up.

1836
01:12:36,540 --> 01:12:38,040
That's so fucked up.

1837
01:12:40,540 --> 01:12:47,880
That's crazy that the brain is, like, prioritized when, like, I'm, like, an example of a failure of that.

1838
01:12:48,580 --> 01:12:50,740
I might as well walk early instead.

1839
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:55,840
Like, alright.

1840
01:12:59,260 --> 01:13:00,160
Where do we go?

1841
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:03,540
Which way?

1842
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:04,720
We go up?

1843
01:13:05,020 --> 01:13:06,240
Did I go up before?

1844
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:07,200
I can't tell.

1845
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:08,800
Oh, he's a corpse!

1846
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:14,320
Why are you a woman?

1847
01:13:15,660 --> 01:13:17,780
Why are you a woman?

1848
01:13:21,740 --> 01:13:23,540
Oh, it's the fox!

1849
01:13:23,620 --> 01:13:24,680
I was like, I'm pretty sure that's a guy!

1850
01:13:28,340 --> 01:13:30,700
Wait, is that the woman from chapter 2?

1851
01:13:31,540 --> 01:13:32,060
Wait, is that the woman from chapter 2?

1852
01:13:32,060 --> 01:13:32,740
Wait, is that the woman from chapter 2?

1853
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:38,840
Oh, it's the!

1854
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:44,100
It's the... it's the guy from the chapter two.

1855
01:13:54,440 --> 01:13:55,620
It's the same one!

1856
01:14:15,410 --> 01:14:16,710
What am I supposed to do?

1857
01:14:22,430 --> 01:14:23,810
Oh, you want me to kill him?

1858
01:14:24,210 --> 01:14:24,690
Wow!

1859
01:14:28,130 --> 01:14:28,730
I'm her!

1860
01:14:29,390 --> 01:14:30,170
I'm woman!

1861
01:14:34,650 --> 01:14:35,130
Alright.

1862
01:14:38,310 --> 01:14:41,370
I guess it's time to avenge her broken heart, I guess.

1863
01:14:42,990 --> 01:14:43,770
Alright, let's go.

1864
01:14:44,170 --> 01:14:46,370
I don't know where I'm going, but okay.

1865
01:14:48,230 --> 01:14:50,050
Where do I go?

1866
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:52,530
I'm her now.

1867
01:14:54,760 --> 01:14:56,590
Real woman Doki Bee?

1868
01:14:56,810 --> 01:14:57,610
Real female?

1869
01:14:58,530 --> 01:15:00,190
Wait, can you smack me?

1870
01:15:06,830 --> 01:15:09,890
Okay, apparently they can't.

1871
01:15:12,990 --> 01:15:13,910
I need to figure this out.

1872
01:15:16,030 --> 01:15:16,590
Whoops,

1873
01:15:19,940 --> 01:15:23,420
I guess... I guess you're not gonna... we're not gonna avenge you.

1874
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:27,600
Okay, I guess.

1875
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,600
Alright, let's... let's fix that.

1876
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:33,920
Alright, let's see.

1877
01:15:36,420 --> 01:15:37,560
What's that spell?

1878
01:15:38,660 --> 01:15:39,880
Wait, where is it?

1879
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:43,160
Where did it... where is it?

1880
01:15:44,460 --> 01:15:46,640
Oh, I can transform... Oh, I can transform anytime!

1881
01:15:48,220 --> 01:15:48,660
Okay.

1882
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:53,200
Oh, is it this one?

1883
01:15:53,380 --> 01:15:53,600
Oh...

1884
01:15:54,380 --> 01:15:55,300
Okay, there you go.

1885
01:15:58,120 --> 01:15:59,060
Alright, we're fine.

1886
01:15:59,320 --> 01:16:01,040
Everything is fine now.

1887
01:16:02,040 --> 01:16:02,480
Alright.

1888
01:16:02,780 --> 01:16:03,720
Do we just go up?

1889
01:16:04,220 --> 01:16:04,940
Where's the shrine?

1890
01:16:08,390 --> 01:16:09,430
Is this just up?

1891
01:16:12,990 --> 01:16:13,990
I'm just gonna go up.

1892
01:16:15,110 --> 01:16:16,850
I have no idea where this shrine is.

1893
01:16:17,130 --> 01:16:18,230
What the fuck?!

1894
01:16:19,610 --> 01:16:21,010
What's the point of being a...

1895
01:16:21,790 --> 01:16:22,790
What's the point of being a woman?

1896
01:16:22,870 --> 01:16:26,290
What's the point of being a woman if it can just hit me?

1897
01:16:26,690 --> 01:16:27,050
Like...

1898
01:16:27,690 --> 01:16:30,350
Like, I might just be a regular monkey at this point.

1899
01:16:34,850 --> 01:16:36,390
Like, this is not fair!

1900
01:16:39,810 --> 01:16:42,270
Why can't I use this in my current state?

1901
01:16:44,810 --> 01:16:46,450
Oh my god, I'm just gonna go to the temple.

1902
01:16:46,510 --> 01:16:47,070
This is bullshit.

1903
01:16:47,170 --> 01:16:48,210
This is actually bullshit.

1904
01:16:48,210 --> 01:16:49,710
Oh my god.

1905
01:16:51,090 --> 01:16:52,630
I can't believe it.

1906
01:16:52,690 --> 01:16:54,610
I might as well just be a regular monkey.

1907
01:16:55,510 --> 01:16:56,630
Like, what's the point?

1908
01:16:59,030 --> 01:16:59,490
Poke!

1909
01:17:00,810 --> 01:17:01,950
Like, what's the point?

1910
01:17:02,530 --> 01:17:05,770
Why can he, she just... Why can people just hit me like that?

1911
01:17:08,350 --> 01:17:09,050
Alright, nice.

1912
01:17:09,930 --> 01:17:10,910
Okay, here we go.

1913
01:17:12,970 --> 01:17:13,990
Like, I assume...

1914
01:17:13,990 --> 01:17:16,290
I assume that, like, you know, when you're...

1915
01:17:16,290 --> 01:17:18,190
You're Fox Lady, you don't get hit.

1916
01:17:18,210 --> 01:17:20,670
But you can still get hit, so what's the point?

1917
01:17:24,250 --> 01:17:24,730
Okay.

1918
01:17:24,750 --> 01:17:25,630
Gotta get this.

1919
01:17:30,310 --> 01:17:32,270
Wait, where do I go after that?

1920
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:39,200
Guys, I don't think I was supposed to do that.

1921
01:17:39,660 --> 01:17:40,580
Guys, I don't...

1922
01:17:41,180 --> 01:17:44,740
Guys, I don't think I was...

1923
01:17:44,740 --> 01:17:46,020
Where am I?

1924
01:17:46,940 --> 01:17:50,420
Where the fuck did I fall?

1925
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:52,980
Wait.

1926
01:17:53,160 --> 01:17:54,240
Oh, this is the frog!

1927
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:54,800
Okay!

1928
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:57,080
I got way back to the frog!

1929
01:17:58,460 --> 01:17:58,940
Okay.

1930
01:17:59,660 --> 01:18:00,420
Alright, guys.

1931
01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:02,060
I actually went back to the frog, guys.

1932
01:18:02,140 --> 01:18:02,400
Whoops.

1933
01:18:03,100 --> 01:18:05,520
I just wanted to kill that one guy again, I guess.

1934
01:18:06,240 --> 01:18:08,280
I'm just farming money at this point.

1935
01:18:09,620 --> 01:18:10,900
I'll always be lost.

1936
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:12,340
I'll never find my way.

1937
01:18:12,660 --> 01:18:14,040
I'll never...

1938
01:18:14,040 --> 01:18:15,380
Bum, bum, bum.

1939
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:17,300
Ba-da-dum.

1940
01:18:17,580 --> 01:18:19,140
Bum, ba-da-dum.

1941
01:18:19,820 --> 01:18:20,400
Bum, ba-da-dum.

1942
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:23,380
Da-da-na-na-num.

1943
01:18:23,560 --> 01:18:27,200
Alright, where do I go?

1944
01:18:27,580 --> 01:18:28,520
Where the fuck?

1945
01:18:28,720 --> 01:18:29,860
I'm just gonna kill this one guy.

1946
01:18:31,860 --> 01:18:32,500
Whew!

1947
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:34,320
Okay, get out.

1948
01:18:36,780 --> 01:18:38,000
Oh, hey, I got gold.

1949
01:18:41,020 --> 01:18:43,140
This is the path, though, isn't it?

1950
01:18:45,540 --> 01:18:47,340
Don't even know anymore.

1951
01:18:47,940 --> 01:18:49,440
I don't even know anymore.

1952
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:50,380
I don't even know anymore.

1953
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:50,820
Oh, no!

1954
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:51,840
There's nothing here.

1955
01:18:53,180 --> 01:18:54,580
Okay, this was not it.

1956
01:18:55,460 --> 01:18:57,100
Somebody said go up!

1957
01:18:58,840 --> 01:18:59,860
I just listened!

1958
01:19:01,900 --> 01:19:02,880
Is it this?

1959
01:19:06,990 --> 01:19:10,690
Oh my god, where the fuck is this pathway you guys all speak of?

1960
01:19:10,990 --> 01:19:11,950
Is it this?

1961
01:19:15,310 --> 01:19:16,530
Is this the path?

1962
01:19:19,670 --> 01:19:21,790
There's so many frozen dudes, guys.

1963
01:19:21,790 --> 01:19:25,790
You gotta be very specific on which frozen dude is the right dude.

1964
01:19:27,030 --> 01:19:27,910
Okay, nice.

1965
01:19:29,310 --> 01:19:29,870
Alright.

1966
01:19:30,150 --> 01:19:30,570
Ow!

1967
01:19:31,290 --> 01:19:31,850
Ow!

1968
01:19:33,690 --> 01:19:34,490
My god!

1969
01:19:34,690 --> 01:19:36,270
Who gave you that big-ass sword?

1970
01:19:39,190 --> 01:19:41,130
My big-ass sword now.

1971
01:19:41,270 --> 01:19:42,390
Not big enough, clearly.

1972
01:19:44,570 --> 01:19:46,950
Am I over- Is Wukong overcompensating?

1973
01:19:53,240 --> 01:19:53,720
Alright.

1974
01:19:54,040 --> 01:19:55,040
Is it this way?

1975
01:19:59,790 --> 01:20:01,030
Am I going the right way?

1976
01:20:03,010 --> 01:20:03,790
Oh, shit.

1977
01:20:03,950 --> 01:20:04,350
Whoops.

1978
01:20:05,210 --> 01:20:05,690
Fuck!

1979
01:20:05,890 --> 01:20:06,170
Okay.

1980
01:20:06,510 --> 01:20:07,230
That's awkward.

1981
01:20:09,090 --> 01:20:10,370
No, I was here before.

1982
01:20:10,550 --> 01:20:11,610
This chest was open.

1983
01:20:13,810 --> 01:20:14,290
Wait.

1984
01:20:14,530 --> 01:20:15,710
This chest was open.

1985
01:20:15,790 --> 01:20:16,490
I was here before.

1986
01:20:16,550 --> 01:20:17,150
Where am I?

1987
01:20:17,890 --> 01:20:19,110
Where is this place?

1988
01:20:20,790 --> 01:20:22,510
I've clearly been here before!

1989
01:20:22,870 --> 01:20:24,530
Where is this place?!

1990
01:20:25,250 --> 01:20:26,750
They all look- They all look the same!

1991
01:20:26,850 --> 01:20:27,670
I can't remember!

1992
01:20:30,910 --> 01:20:32,250
I can't remember!

1993
01:20:32,410 --> 01:20:33,990
It all looks the same!

1994
01:20:36,010 --> 01:20:37,450
Okay, I'm going the right way.

1995
01:20:37,850 --> 01:20:39,250
Alright, that's all that matters.

1996
01:20:41,370 --> 01:20:42,730
I'll hydrate real fast.

1997
01:20:44,810 --> 01:20:46,170
Previously on Lost.

1998
01:20:48,990 --> 01:20:49,970
Is this it?

1999
01:20:50,170 --> 01:20:51,010
Do I go this way?

2000
01:20:52,250 --> 01:20:53,830
Oh, it's you guys again!

2001
01:20:54,750 --> 01:20:57,250
Wait, you're alive?!

2002
01:20:58,170 --> 01:20:59,790
I thought I killed you guys!

2003
01:21:01,210 --> 01:21:01,910
It's okay.

2004
01:21:02,010 --> 01:21:04,050
I can make him a single child again.

2005
01:21:06,150 --> 01:21:07,430
As your mom intended.

2006
01:21:07,750 --> 01:21:10,330
Your mom hired me because she can't take care of both of you.

2007
01:21:10,730 --> 01:21:12,670
Like, that's too many miles to feed.

2008
01:21:14,490 --> 01:21:18,970
Your mom hired me to make sure there will be no more children.

2009
01:21:20,950 --> 01:21:22,530
Alright, they grow back.

2010
01:21:25,710 --> 01:21:27,330
Okay, I assume I have to go this way then.

2011
01:21:31,910 --> 01:21:33,670
Uh, I guess I go this way?

2012
01:21:34,950 --> 01:21:35,910
Follow the path?

2013
01:21:38,210 --> 01:21:38,990
Alright, nice.

2014
01:21:40,450 --> 01:21:41,370
Down we go!

2015
01:21:43,550 --> 01:21:45,650
Just want to make sure that these guys don't bother me.

2016
01:21:47,050 --> 01:21:47,490
What?!

2017
01:21:48,670 --> 01:21:49,670
Okay, it's fine.

2018
01:21:49,790 --> 01:21:51,490
We can still- We can still do this.

2019
01:21:52,930 --> 01:21:53,370
Bam!

2020
01:21:53,830 --> 01:21:54,270
Alright.

2021
01:21:54,270 --> 01:21:54,410
Alright.

2022
01:21:54,470 --> 01:21:55,450
Just gonna hydrate.

2023
01:21:55,890 --> 01:21:58,630
There has to be like an incense area nearby.

2024
01:21:59,210 --> 01:22:05,130
Like, I- There's no way I have to go in there with like 0 HP.

2025
01:22:06,830 --> 01:22:07,710
Oh shit, no.

2026
01:22:08,490 --> 01:22:09,150
Oh no.

2027
01:22:11,750 --> 01:22:12,390
It's fine.

2028
01:22:12,570 --> 01:22:12,990
We're fine.

2029
01:22:14,150 --> 01:22:14,590
Absorb.

2030
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:19,640
Alright.

2031
01:22:22,620 --> 01:22:23,580
Oh, there it is!

2032
01:22:23,780 --> 01:22:24,220
Nice.

2033
01:22:24,420 --> 01:22:25,460
Oh wait, this is the- Oh!

2034
01:22:25,680 --> 01:22:26,680
I was here before.

2035
01:22:28,720 --> 01:22:29,460
Okay, nice.

2036
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:30,400
I was here before.

2037
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:34,040
Alright.

2038
01:22:34,640 --> 01:22:35,740
This should be it, right?

2039
01:22:40,850 --> 01:22:41,910
This should be it, right?

2040
01:22:42,310 --> 01:22:42,750
Like...

2041
01:22:45,690 --> 01:22:46,130
Alright.

2042
01:22:46,410 --> 01:22:47,870
And then we go...

2043
01:22:47,870 --> 01:22:48,870
Oh hey, it's the eagle!

2044
01:22:51,310 --> 01:22:53,170
Oh my god, I fucking hate you.

2045
01:22:54,410 --> 01:22:55,470
I'm not kidding.

2046
01:22:56,630 --> 01:22:57,270
Hehehe.

2047
01:22:57,550 --> 01:22:59,750
I actually fucked you.

2048
01:22:59,990 --> 01:23:02,850
I actually fucked you.

2049
01:23:03,190 --> 01:23:03,830
Like...

2050
01:23:05,070 --> 01:23:06,150
You know what?

2051
01:23:06,230 --> 01:23:08,430
I'm fucking bringing the big baby time.

2052
01:23:08,770 --> 01:23:10,530
You don't deserve anything.

2053
01:23:10,790 --> 01:23:13,490
You don't deserve anything in life.

2054
01:23:13,750 --> 01:23:15,350
How dare you fly!

2055
01:23:16,390 --> 01:23:19,110
I fucking- I could rip the wings off your body.

2056
01:23:19,490 --> 01:23:21,390
That's not psychopathic at all!

2057
01:23:22,550 --> 01:23:23,390
There we go.

2058
01:23:23,590 --> 01:23:23,730
Alright.

2059
01:23:24,130 --> 01:23:24,450
There we go.

2060
01:23:24,450 --> 01:23:24,790
Uh-oh.

2061
01:23:24,790 --> 01:23:24,970
It's not like we should do this.

2062
01:23:25,690 --> 01:23:27,250
Alright, he's gonna come over here.

2063
01:23:27,390 --> 01:23:28,370
Okay, I guess not.

2064
01:23:28,450 --> 01:23:29,590
I wasted my entire thing.

2065
01:23:29,790 --> 01:23:31,970
I decided to throw a snowball for once.

2066
01:23:33,790 --> 01:23:34,230
Alright.

2067
01:23:34,730 --> 01:23:35,850
Oh, that should be it!

2068
01:23:35,850 --> 01:23:36,210
It's red!

2069
01:23:40,330 --> 01:23:41,090
Oh, wait, what?

2070
01:23:43,210 --> 01:23:45,030
All I'm saying is that...

2071
01:23:46,090 --> 01:23:50,250
is that some birds just do not deserve to fly, and that's one of the birds.

2072
01:23:52,470 --> 01:23:52,910
Alright.

2073
01:23:52,910 --> 01:23:53,150
Alright.

2074
01:23:54,350 --> 01:23:54,910
Okay.

2075
01:23:55,750 --> 01:23:57,070
That should be him, right?

2076
01:23:57,350 --> 01:23:59,030
Alright, now I can be Wolfman.

2077
01:24:01,770 --> 01:24:03,630
Where is my inventory?

2078
01:24:06,130 --> 01:24:06,890
Fox Moon!

2079
01:24:07,730 --> 01:24:08,630
There I go.

2080
01:24:10,470 --> 01:24:11,410
There I go.

2081
01:24:11,510 --> 01:24:13,710
How dare you follow your dreams, boy?

2082
01:24:14,590 --> 01:24:16,390
How fucking dare you?

2083
01:24:21,180 --> 01:24:22,460
Oh, what's that?

2084
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:24,120
Ugh.

2085
01:24:24,420 --> 01:24:25,620
I hate that sound.

2086
01:24:26,100 --> 01:24:27,420
It's like so fleshy.

2087
01:24:29,200 --> 01:24:30,340
Hello, I'm here.

2088
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:32,660
Oh, that's why.

2089
01:24:32,860 --> 01:24:33,960
It's literally blood.

2090
01:24:36,820 --> 01:24:37,420
Hello.

2091
01:24:38,620 --> 01:24:39,220
Oh!

2092
01:24:40,360 --> 01:24:40,960
Okay.

2093
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:42,460
What am I supposed to do?

2094
01:24:42,500 --> 01:24:43,380
I'm literally a fox.

2095
01:24:43,800 --> 01:24:44,200
I...

2096
01:24:44,200 --> 01:24:45,400
Okay.

2097
01:24:46,160 --> 01:24:49,400
Alright, today I learned that, like, it didn't...

2098
01:24:49,400 --> 01:24:52,040
I couldn't do anything about it.

2099
01:24:52,040 --> 01:24:53,440
I'm literally a fucking fox.

2100
01:24:56,420 --> 01:24:57,020
Poke!

2101
01:24:57,620 --> 01:24:57,980
Woo!

2102
01:24:58,140 --> 01:24:58,920
Got your dick!

2103
01:25:01,060 --> 01:25:01,660
Alright.

2104
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:02,360
Fire!

2105
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:04,440
Fire!

2106
01:25:05,100 --> 01:25:05,600
Ow!

2107
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:07,200
Fire!

2108
01:25:07,660 --> 01:25:08,220
Okay.

2109
01:25:08,580 --> 01:25:09,100
Okay.

2110
01:25:09,260 --> 01:25:09,780
That...

2111
01:25:09,780 --> 01:25:10,540
Okay, bro.

2112
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:11,120
Chill out.

2113
01:25:12,080 --> 01:25:12,680
Chill...

2114
01:25:12,680 --> 01:25:13,500
Actually...

2115
01:25:13,820 --> 01:25:14,800
Chill out, bro.

2116
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:15,820
Oh, yeah.

2117
01:25:17,220 --> 01:25:19,860
He's gonna whack you in the shins, I guess.

2118
01:25:20,160 --> 01:25:21,860
I like how the majority of these...

2119
01:25:21,860 --> 01:25:24,560
like, giant-ass bosses, I'm just whacking their shins.

2120
01:25:26,380 --> 01:25:26,940
Like...

2121
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:28,300
He's just...

2122
01:25:28,860 --> 01:25:31,840
Just some fucking ant beating up his feet.

2123
01:25:33,680 --> 01:25:34,240
Alright.

2124
01:25:34,460 --> 01:25:35,240
What's he doing?

2125
01:25:35,660 --> 01:25:36,480
Oh, shit!

2126
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:38,640
Like, what is he gonna do?

2127
01:25:38,680 --> 01:25:39,660
Fucking kick me?

2128
01:25:39,940 --> 01:25:40,660
Like, ow!

2129
01:25:42,080 --> 01:25:42,640
Okay.

2130
01:25:43,260 --> 01:25:43,820
Okay.

2131
01:25:43,900 --> 01:25:44,380
Yeah.

2132
01:25:44,820 --> 01:25:45,380
Alright.

2133
01:25:49,900 --> 01:25:50,460
Okay.

2134
01:25:50,600 --> 01:25:51,120
Okay.

2135
01:25:51,400 --> 01:25:51,540
Okay.

2136
01:25:51,540 --> 01:25:52,300
I'm actually gonna do it.

2137
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:53,280
Like...

2138
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:56,480
I don't know what I think actually happened.

2139
01:25:58,700 --> 01:25:59,300
Okay.

2140
01:25:59,380 --> 01:25:59,740
Yes.

2141
01:25:59,860 --> 01:26:00,660
He was...

2142
01:26:00,660 --> 01:26:01,460
Yes.

2143
01:26:01,640 --> 01:26:03,840
That was absolutely the strat.

2144
01:26:04,520 --> 01:26:06,380
That's getting you chow received.

2145
01:26:10,580 --> 01:26:14,600
How the fuck was I supposed to know he could just kick me?

2146
01:26:15,180 --> 01:26:16,360
Anyway, he's dead.

2147
01:26:16,600 --> 01:26:17,440
That was easy.

2148
01:26:19,360 --> 01:26:20,180
What are you gonna do?

2149
01:26:20,180 --> 01:26:20,620
Shoot me?

2150
01:26:20,920 --> 01:26:21,520
I'm gonna...

2151
01:26:22,320 --> 01:26:23,960
Man holding a gun.

2152
01:26:24,160 --> 01:26:25,460
What are you gonna do?

2153
01:26:25,500 --> 01:26:26,000
Shoot me?

2154
01:26:26,980 --> 01:26:27,500
Nice.

2155
01:26:27,560 --> 01:26:28,440
We got the other chief.

2156
01:26:28,680 --> 01:26:30,300
I think we were missing one more chief, right?

2157
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:32,480
Oh, jing san...

2158
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:34,080
That's what he looks like?!

2159
01:26:35,020 --> 01:26:35,540
That...

2160
01:26:35,540 --> 01:26:36,760
I did not see a head.

2161
01:26:37,160 --> 01:26:38,640
Like, where was your head?

2162
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:40,840
That was not what it looked like.

2163
01:26:45,680 --> 01:26:49,380
A tiny monkey was smacking your shins when you kick it.

2164
01:26:50,160 --> 01:26:50,680
Hahaha!

2165
01:26:51,900 --> 01:26:53,260
Oh, that was the plank.

2166
01:26:53,280 --> 01:26:53,540
Yeah!

2167
01:26:53,560 --> 01:26:56,960
Yeah, I was like, bro, my lore thing is all fucking messed up.

2168
01:26:57,840 --> 01:26:59,480
It's so behind schedule.

2169
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:03,120
That was before the surgery.

2170
01:27:03,660 --> 01:27:06,160
I was like, that cannot be what it looked like.

2171
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:07,140
There's no way.

2172
01:27:08,040 --> 01:27:10,360
Where the fuck is the YoGuyChief, right?

2173
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:14,600
Wait, wasn't it a YoGuyChief?

2174
01:27:17,460 --> 01:27:18,440
Where was he?

2175
01:27:19,160 --> 01:27:20,360
Or was he a king?

2176
01:27:21,180 --> 01:27:22,840
Oh, there's the red dragon.

2177
01:27:22,840 --> 01:27:25,340
That was not... Okay, yeah, that was what he looks like.

2178
01:27:26,160 --> 01:27:27,220
It was a captain?

2179
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:28,760
The fuck?

2180
01:27:32,980 --> 01:27:33,420
Captain...

2181
01:27:33,960 --> 01:27:34,780
Kalpa White.

2182
01:27:34,960 --> 01:27:36,700
Okay, we're gonna find him.

2183
01:27:37,300 --> 01:27:38,640
He has to be a king, right?

2184
01:27:38,780 --> 01:27:40,200
There... No, that's Y's voice.

2185
01:27:40,600 --> 01:27:41,620
Hey, where is he?

2186
01:27:42,200 --> 01:27:43,300
Does he not exist?

2187
01:27:47,800 --> 01:27:48,780
Hey, there's the dog.

2188
01:27:49,740 --> 01:27:50,880
Look for legs.

2189
01:27:52,660 --> 01:27:53,580
Where did he go?

2190
01:27:53,800 --> 01:27:54,580
Oh, there he is.

2191
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:55,500
Oh, there he goes.

2192
01:27:55,540 --> 01:27:56,500
Yeah, that's what he looked like.

2193
01:27:56,720 --> 01:27:59,360
Yeah, that's how he looked.

2194
01:27:59,380 --> 01:28:01,560
Yeah, that's sort of how he looked like, I guess.

2195
01:28:04,240 --> 01:28:07,820
All right, is it time for a wolf lady?

2196
01:28:08,700 --> 01:28:09,220
Wolfman?

2197
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:13,140
Is it time for you to show up?

2198
01:28:16,240 --> 01:28:16,760
Wolfman.

2199
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:19,220
Wolf lady is here.

2200
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:22,920
She's here now.

2201
01:28:24,180 --> 01:28:24,700
Hello.

2202
01:28:25,740 --> 01:28:26,660
I'm here to...

2203
01:28:26,660 --> 01:28:27,540
avenge...

2204
01:28:31,480 --> 01:28:33,720
I'm here to avenge my death.

2205
01:28:34,640 --> 01:28:35,540
I guess not.

2206
01:28:38,060 --> 01:28:39,220
Okay, we gotta...

2207
01:28:43,720 --> 01:28:45,400
Just gotta get this first.

2208
01:28:45,560 --> 01:28:46,360
I want to rest up.

2209
01:28:48,480 --> 01:28:50,500
All right, wolf lady time.

2210
01:28:51,680 --> 01:28:52,400
Wolf lady.

2211
01:28:56,060 --> 01:28:57,240
All right, here I am.

2212
01:28:58,420 --> 01:28:59,320
Hello, sir.

2213
01:28:59,400 --> 01:29:00,760
I'm here to avenge...

2214
01:29:01,220 --> 01:29:01,560
Wolf lady.

2215
01:29:03,630 --> 01:29:04,380
Is that you?

2216
01:29:08,510 --> 01:29:09,090
Goodbye.

2217
01:29:10,170 --> 01:29:11,110
Is that you?

2218
01:29:11,430 --> 01:29:13,030
Where the fuck do you live?

2219
01:29:14,230 --> 01:29:15,090
Is that you?

2220
01:29:16,950 --> 01:29:18,830
Where the fuck do you live?

2221
01:29:24,240 --> 01:29:25,420
Where does he live?

2222
01:29:26,740 --> 01:29:28,160
Box lady confused.

2223
01:29:33,200 --> 01:29:34,880
Oh, he's in the side room?

2224
01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:36,520
Wait, keep going?

2225
01:29:38,700 --> 01:29:40,400
Okay, upstairs and go left.

2226
01:29:40,600 --> 01:29:40,880
Okay.

2227
01:29:41,080 --> 01:29:42,140
Goodbye, guys.

2228
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:46,460
It's so nice that like they're not attacking me now that I'm...

2229
01:29:47,180 --> 01:29:48,740
I'm just a little fox lady.

2230
01:29:50,240 --> 01:29:51,560
He's further ahead?

2231
01:29:51,860 --> 01:29:52,180
Yeah?

2232
01:29:56,100 --> 01:29:57,080
All right, goodbye.

2233
01:29:58,040 --> 01:29:59,420
Fox lady confused.

2234
01:30:00,280 --> 01:30:02,760
Fox lady just want to avenge.

2235
01:30:02,860 --> 01:30:04,340
Just wants revenge.

2236
01:30:05,960 --> 01:30:06,780
That's not you.

2237
01:30:06,780 --> 01:30:06,800
That's not you.

2238
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:08,240
Oh, God.

2239
01:30:08,380 --> 01:30:08,800
Oh, no.

2240
01:30:09,080 --> 01:30:09,900
No, please.

2241
01:30:10,380 --> 01:30:12,320
Please, fox lady doesn't know what to do.

2242
01:30:12,420 --> 01:30:12,740
No!

2243
01:30:14,120 --> 01:30:15,580
How did you know?

2244
01:30:16,640 --> 01:30:17,680
Holy shit!

2245
01:30:18,460 --> 01:30:20,020
Wait, you're just a person.

2246
01:30:20,580 --> 01:30:21,620
What the fuck?

2247
01:30:22,600 --> 01:30:24,280
You're literally just a man.

2248
01:30:25,740 --> 01:30:27,020
Like holy shit.

2249
01:30:28,640 --> 01:30:30,140
Bro, he's just a...

2250
01:30:31,840 --> 01:30:33,740
Bro, I beat up so many yaguas.

2251
01:30:33,860 --> 01:30:35,260
You're just a fucking man.

2252
01:30:36,500 --> 01:30:37,460
He's blind.

2253
01:30:38,140 --> 01:30:39,640
He's still a man.

2254
01:30:42,180 --> 01:30:43,260
What the fuck?

2255
01:30:43,400 --> 01:30:44,380
Overseeing monk.

2256
01:30:44,660 --> 01:30:44,820
Oh.

2257
01:30:45,200 --> 01:30:46,420
He's not even blind.

2258
01:30:46,520 --> 01:30:48,440
He just chose to cover his eyes.

2259
01:30:51,240 --> 01:30:52,020
All right.

2260
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:52,680
Let's see.

2261
01:30:56,060 --> 01:30:56,960
All right.

2262
01:30:56,960 --> 01:30:57,640
Here we go.

2263
01:31:01,720 --> 01:31:02,500
Doesn't know.

2264
01:31:03,180 --> 01:31:03,780
Stupid.

2265
01:31:05,260 --> 01:31:05,860
I don't know what to do.

2266
01:31:06,080 --> 01:31:06,200
What the fuck?

2267
01:31:06,580 --> 01:31:07,320
No.

2268
01:31:07,320 --> 01:31:08,400
Jesus Christ.

2269
01:31:08,980 --> 01:31:10,180
Where the...

2270
01:31:10,180 --> 01:31:11,220
What the fuck?

2271
01:31:11,280 --> 01:31:12,080
How did he know?

2272
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:16,200
How did he know?

2273
01:31:16,680 --> 01:31:20,420
Like that's fucking crazy.

2274
01:31:21,740 --> 01:31:24,200
He was ready to swing.

2275
01:31:25,340 --> 01:31:27,420
How did he know though?

2276
01:31:28,620 --> 01:31:30,940
Okay, back to fox lady.

2277
01:31:32,420 --> 01:31:35,240
What do you mean I cannot use it?

2278
01:31:35,820 --> 01:31:37,100
Alright, where is it?

2279
01:31:37,180 --> 01:31:37,700
Where is he?

2280
01:31:38,240 --> 01:31:39,240
Where is the guy?

2281
01:31:43,680 --> 01:31:45,060
Am I still in combat?

2282
01:31:45,260 --> 01:31:47,080
Is he still trying to... oh, you're blind!

2283
01:31:47,220 --> 01:31:47,460
Stop!

2284
01:31:48,780 --> 01:31:51,200
Guys, you're blind!

2285
01:31:51,300 --> 01:31:52,760
It's embarrassing for you.

2286
01:31:53,460 --> 01:31:54,620
You should stop that.

2287
01:31:56,140 --> 01:31:57,820
You should really stop that, man.

2288
01:31:58,200 --> 01:31:59,240
What the fuck?

2289
01:31:59,260 --> 01:32:00,440
That's not even you!

2290
01:32:02,340 --> 01:32:03,500
Oh god, oh no.

2291
01:32:04,900 --> 01:32:06,580
Oh, this is a different guy!

2292
01:32:06,700 --> 01:32:08,220
That's electrocuting me!

2293
01:32:09,940 --> 01:32:11,900
He's not even part of the fight!

2294
01:32:13,560 --> 01:32:15,100
The other guy's not even blind!

2295
01:32:15,180 --> 01:32:15,720
It's not fair!

2296
01:32:17,940 --> 01:32:19,220
Oh my god, bro.

2297
01:32:19,380 --> 01:32:20,080
I just... I just...

2298
01:32:20,080 --> 01:32:22,360
Please, just let me kill this blind man.

2299
01:32:22,780 --> 01:32:23,300
Please.

2300
01:32:23,380 --> 01:32:24,820
It's self-defense, man.

2301
01:32:24,920 --> 01:32:25,540
Come on.

2302
01:32:27,680 --> 01:32:30,260
He doesn't care about self-defense, clearly.

2303
01:32:30,600 --> 01:32:31,120
Oh!

2304
01:32:31,580 --> 01:32:32,700
That's who you were!

2305
01:32:33,500 --> 01:32:35,100
Hey, your buddy's getting beat up right now.

2306
01:32:35,280 --> 01:32:35,800
You don't care?

2307
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:36,780
Okay, that's good.

2308
01:32:37,240 --> 01:32:37,900
Thank god.

2309
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:42,640
It's not fair!

2310
01:32:42,860 --> 01:32:43,840
He has a vision!

2311
01:32:44,720 --> 01:32:45,840
Okay, where do I go?

2312
01:32:50,100 --> 01:32:53,000
Straight or left, guys?

2313
01:32:54,720 --> 01:32:55,460
Straight up?

2314
01:32:56,860 --> 01:32:59,880
Okay, first we're gonna take the fox lady over first.

2315
01:33:01,620 --> 01:33:04,740
I'm gonna take the fox lady over to, like, the dead guy.

2316
01:33:08,340 --> 01:33:11,020
I mean, that's not the end of the story anyway, right?

2317
01:33:12,040 --> 01:33:12,420
Wait.

2318
01:33:13,240 --> 01:33:15,880
Is he the... Is the fox lady the end of the story?

2319
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:19,500
Is that the end of the story?

2320
01:33:25,340 --> 01:33:26,140
Wait, is it?

2321
01:33:26,220 --> 01:33:26,660
Oh, no?

2322
01:33:26,760 --> 01:33:27,620
Okay, I'm just gonna go then.

2323
01:33:29,480 --> 01:33:31,020
Other way for the fox lady?

2324
01:33:31,380 --> 01:33:31,760
Oh.

2325
01:33:32,560 --> 01:33:33,820
The fuck is this way?

2326
01:33:36,560 --> 01:33:38,300
Okay, it's just a side quest, so it doesn't matter.

2327
01:33:40,660 --> 01:33:41,480
Okay, this way.

2328
01:33:47,870 --> 01:33:48,310
Here?

2329
01:33:52,240 --> 01:33:53,040
Is it up here?

2330
01:33:55,940 --> 01:33:57,320
Then left sta- This one?

2331
01:33:58,880 --> 01:33:59,760
Or this one?

2332
01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:02,600
Oh, up there?

2333
01:34:02,680 --> 01:34:02,880
Okay.

2334
01:34:04,720 --> 01:34:05,300
All right.

2335
01:34:09,520 --> 01:34:10,440
All right, here we go.

2336
01:34:12,940 --> 01:34:13,760
They don't know.

2337
01:34:14,300 --> 01:34:15,040
Is it you?

2338
01:34:17,260 --> 01:34:18,400
Are you a bad guy?

2339
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:26,520
No - No,

2340
01:34:31,540 --> 01:34:31,680
I'm not a bad guy.

2341
01:34:32,140 --> 01:34:36,020
This is...

2342
01:34:36,020 --> 01:34:38,080
in that...

2343
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:39,440
Well, they bear it, right?

2344
01:34:39,440 --> 01:34:39,740
Connect me to Spidey.

2345
01:34:39,740 --> 01:34:41,060
I'll go bye-bye.

2346
01:34:41,060 --> 01:34:42,860
Trans buckle.

2347
01:34:42,860 --> 01:34:46,180
Justin - Mazel.

2348
01:34:51,340 --> 01:34:53,100
Why would she find peace?

2349
01:34:53,220 --> 01:34:54,340
You literally killed her!

2350
01:34:55,280 --> 01:34:55,980
That's right.

2351
01:34:56,060 --> 01:34:56,920
I wasn't your wife.

2352
01:34:57,020 --> 01:34:58,140
I was a monkey instead.

2353
01:35:07,080 --> 01:35:09,040
JK, I was a monkey man.

2354
01:35:19,940 --> 01:35:20,920
What do you mean?

2355
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:22,260
Everything I do is for revenge.

2356
01:35:24,640 --> 01:35:25,060
Like...

2357
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:26,940
What the fuck?

2358
01:35:27,380 --> 01:35:28,500
How do you move so fast?

2359
01:35:28,540 --> 01:35:28,900
You're old.

2360
01:35:32,640 --> 01:35:33,620
Wait, that's not fair.

2361
01:35:34,060 --> 01:35:36,080
Where did those reflexes come from?

2362
01:35:36,560 --> 01:35:41,060
You couldn't use those reflexes to save your fucking dead son in that dream?

2363
01:35:42,380 --> 01:35:43,140
That's fucking right.

2364
01:35:43,180 --> 01:35:43,720
I said it.

2365
01:35:44,140 --> 01:35:45,840
Jesus Christ, your reflexes.

2366
01:35:49,020 --> 01:35:49,660
What's he doing?

2367
01:35:50,440 --> 01:35:51,280
That's just paper.

2368
01:35:51,420 --> 01:35:52,260
That's not going to hurt me.

2369
01:35:53,260 --> 01:35:55,120
I don't think the paper is going to hurt me, guys.

2370
01:35:55,260 --> 01:35:57,040
I think the paper is going to hurt me, guys.

2371
01:35:57,640 --> 01:36:02,460
Oh my god.

2372
01:36:05,320 --> 01:36:08,000
Guys, that paper looks mighty dangerous right about now.

2373
01:36:11,760 --> 01:36:13,260
I thought it was just paper.

2374
01:36:13,320 --> 01:36:13,880
I guess not.

2375
01:36:15,120 --> 01:36:15,480
Bam!

2376
01:36:15,660 --> 01:36:16,160
Oh, what?

2377
01:36:16,180 --> 01:36:21,900
That was my co- That was my strongest- Oh shit!

2378
01:36:22,620 --> 01:36:23,180
What?

2379
01:36:26,260 --> 01:36:28,220
It went by so fast.

2380
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:30,800
I was so close.

2381
01:36:32,740 --> 01:36:34,840
His rejectiles were so fast.

2382
01:36:35,020 --> 01:36:36,400
I couldn't dodge it.

2383
01:36:37,560 --> 01:36:42,200
How did I die in a pa- Oh no, I have to do this all over again.

2384
01:36:42,240 --> 01:36:44,580
I don't remember how I got there.

2385
01:36:44,920 --> 01:36:47,040
I don't even know.

2386
01:36:47,840 --> 01:36:48,340
Oh shit, okay.

2387
01:36:48,680 --> 01:36:51,680
Alright, we're going to figure- Oh no.

2388
01:36:52,260 --> 01:36:53,980
Okay, we're going to figure it out.

2389
01:36:54,240 --> 01:36:57,060
We're going to figure it out.

2390
01:36:57,700 --> 01:37:00,040
We can do this, I believe.

2391
01:37:00,440 --> 01:37:01,500
I believe.

2392
01:37:04,680 --> 01:37:05,600
Oh yeah!

2393
01:37:06,200 --> 01:37:09,020
He- Wait, that makes sense.

2394
01:37:09,380 --> 01:37:10,760
He became a wizard.

2395
01:37:11,040 --> 01:37:12,000
You're right.

2396
01:37:12,760 --> 01:37:15,180
He never made after that.

2397
01:37:15,180 --> 01:37:18,580
He never got with the fox wife.

2398
01:37:18,740 --> 01:37:20,340
So he became a wizard.

2399
01:37:20,540 --> 01:37:22,120
So he became a monk.

2400
01:37:22,120 --> 01:37:23,960
He never married again.

2401
01:37:24,760 --> 01:37:26,000
It's so true.

2402
01:37:26,160 --> 01:37:26,760
It's true.

2403
01:37:26,900 --> 01:37:30,340
I was like, how the fuck did you turn into this guy?

2404
01:37:30,680 --> 01:37:36,140
You were like a fucking- Like a- Like some emperor's guard or some shit.

2405
01:37:37,580 --> 01:37:39,900
Okay, I don't really remember the pathways.

2406
01:37:40,020 --> 01:37:41,160
I'm just swinging it.

2407
01:37:42,620 --> 01:37:44,300
Oh, please don't hurt me.

2408
01:37:45,340 --> 01:37:46,620
No, please don't hurt me.

2409
01:37:46,620 --> 01:37:47,920
Don't hurt me.

2410
01:37:47,920 --> 01:37:53,680
Oh, he doesn't know- He- Oh no, I got lost!

2411
01:37:54,200 --> 01:37:54,780
Oh!

2412
01:37:55,600 --> 01:37:56,280
Oh,

2413
01:38:00,330 --> 01:38:03,430
my waist didn't- Okay, I fell off.

2414
01:38:03,610 --> 01:38:03,670
Okay, I fell off.

2415
01:38:03,910 --> 01:38:05,570
I fell down.

2416
01:38:05,910 --> 01:38:09,150
I accidentally fell down, guys.

2417
01:38:09,670 --> 01:38:10,350
Okay.

2418
01:38:10,970 --> 01:38:11,970
That's fine.

2419
01:38:12,230 --> 01:38:12,830
Okay.

2420
01:38:12,830 --> 01:38:13,950
So happens.

2421
01:38:14,410 --> 01:38:14,470
So happens.

2422
01:38:14,490 --> 01:38:15,170
So happens.

2423
01:38:15,250 --> 01:38:15,930
Oh my god.

2424
01:38:15,950 --> 01:38:16,650
Okay.

2425
01:38:17,190 --> 01:38:19,150
Then we beat up the other magician.

2426
01:38:19,950 --> 01:38:21,170
I fell off, guys.

2427
01:38:21,310 --> 01:38:22,030
I fell off.

2428
01:38:24,870 --> 01:38:26,190
I miss-o-doki.

2429
01:38:26,630 --> 01:38:27,470
Peek-doki.

2430
01:38:27,910 --> 01:38:28,390
Nuff.

2431
01:38:28,710 --> 01:38:29,730
Wash-doki.

2432
01:38:31,290 --> 01:38:34,090
Okay, it was this, and then it was up here.

2433
01:38:34,790 --> 01:38:35,550
I remember.

2434
01:38:35,830 --> 01:38:37,490
I'll get rid of him just in case.

2435
01:38:38,030 --> 01:38:39,830
Like, fuck this one guy in particular.

2436
01:38:40,110 --> 01:38:41,110
I don't like how he looks.

2437
01:38:42,430 --> 01:38:43,570
Alright, here we go.

2438
01:38:49,240 --> 01:38:51,060
Okay, not- I forgot.

2439
01:38:51,320 --> 01:38:54,940
I didn't realize I ran past these wizards before.

2440
01:38:55,700 --> 01:38:57,440
Alright, now I know.

2441
01:38:58,100 --> 01:38:59,160
I need to turn.

2442
01:39:01,740 --> 01:39:02,540
Nice, alright.

2443
01:39:03,220 --> 01:39:05,180
Alright, we're going in already.

2444
01:39:05,380 --> 01:39:08,840
Like, a bit HP lost, but that's fine.

2445
01:39:10,200 --> 01:39:11,000
I guess.

2446
01:39:13,120 --> 01:39:13,940
That's fine.

2447
01:39:15,620 --> 01:39:16,220
Alright.

2448
01:39:17,300 --> 01:39:18,220
Big baby!

2449
01:39:20,140 --> 01:39:21,100
That's fucking right.

2450
01:39:21,180 --> 01:39:21,460
That's fucking right.

2451
01:39:22,480 --> 01:39:24,100
And then Wolfman!

2452
01:39:24,440 --> 01:39:24,900
Wolf.

2453
01:39:25,140 --> 01:39:25,700
Wolf.

2454
01:39:26,560 --> 01:39:27,120
Wolf!

2455
01:39:27,940 --> 01:39:29,020
That's fucking right.

2456
01:39:29,060 --> 01:39:30,120
No paper for you.

2457
01:39:31,360 --> 01:39:32,860
No paper for you.

2458
01:39:34,040 --> 01:39:34,980
That's fucking right.

2459
01:39:35,160 --> 01:39:35,880
Oh shit.

2460
01:39:36,120 --> 01:39:36,760
Oh shit.

2461
01:39:37,360 --> 01:39:40,300
Oh no, he's gonna use the power of paper again.

2462
01:39:40,840 --> 01:39:41,400
Okay.

2463
01:39:42,380 --> 01:39:43,680
I can do the same.

2464
01:39:44,320 --> 01:39:45,380
The power of hair!

2465
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:48,140
That's fucking right!

2466
01:39:48,700 --> 01:39:49,340
Ow!

2467
01:39:49,520 --> 01:39:50,960
The power of hair!

2468
01:39:52,540 --> 01:39:53,520
That's right!

2469
01:39:55,320 --> 01:39:58,720
If you can use paper, I shall use hair!

2470
01:40:01,140 --> 01:40:02,000
Oh my god.

2471
01:40:02,140 --> 01:40:03,980
Like, I can't even hit you.

2472
01:40:04,400 --> 01:40:05,040
Like...

2473
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:10,340
What the fuck!

2474
01:40:16,370 --> 01:40:17,010
Jesus!

2475
01:40:17,010 --> 01:40:17,410
Jesus!

2476
01:40:18,730 --> 01:40:19,470
Poke!

2477
01:40:19,810 --> 01:40:20,550
What?!

2478
01:40:22,720 --> 01:40:24,230
Wait a minute, I can't just poke you!

2479
01:40:26,430 --> 01:40:27,170
Alright.

2480
01:40:30,530 --> 01:40:31,970
I guess I run.

2481
01:40:32,190 --> 01:40:33,330
Paper coming.

2482
01:40:33,590 --> 01:40:35,850
No, he's a level 100 wizard!

2483
01:40:36,370 --> 01:40:38,570
He's the strongest wizard of them all!

2484
01:40:41,070 --> 01:40:42,550
Holy fuck!

2485
01:40:43,760 --> 01:40:44,130
Jesus.

2486
01:40:44,790 --> 01:40:47,590
Oh my god, he is a strong wizard.

2487
01:40:48,830 --> 01:40:51,050
This is what happens when he has no bitches.

2488
01:40:53,010 --> 01:40:54,770
Oh my god, bro.

2489
01:40:56,650 --> 01:40:58,350
What the fuck, bro!

2490
01:40:58,870 --> 01:41:00,090
Get a bitch!

2491
01:41:00,310 --> 01:41:00,870
Come on!

2492
01:41:04,890 --> 01:41:07,730
No bitches for this poor old man!

2493
01:41:11,570 --> 01:41:12,170
Oh...

2494
01:41:12,170 --> 01:41:12,570
Oh no!

2495
01:41:13,470 --> 01:41:14,290
That's five!

2496
01:41:14,590 --> 01:41:15,870
No, that's not five!

2497
01:41:16,210 --> 01:41:17,150
Oh my god!

2498
01:41:17,690 --> 01:41:19,130
I did it!

2499
01:41:21,270 --> 01:41:21,870
Oh...

2500
01:41:21,870 --> 01:41:22,970
You can be one.

2501
01:41:22,970 --> 01:41:23,190
I can do it.

2502
01:41:24,350 --> 01:41:25,490
Oh well.

2503
01:41:25,790 --> 01:41:29,150
I'll try it.

2504
01:41:29,670 --> 01:41:31,830
Yeah, at least you get to die a wizard.

2505
01:41:32,150 --> 01:41:33,370
As long as she doesn't...

2506
01:41:33,370 --> 01:41:33,390
I can do it!

2507
01:41:33,430 --> 01:41:34,410
I can do it too!

2508
01:41:34,970 --> 01:41:35,890
I can do it!

2509
01:41:35,890 --> 01:41:36,110
I can do it!

2510
01:41:36,230 --> 01:41:37,090
Oh, no.

2511
01:41:37,150 --> 01:41:37,710
oh, no.

2512
01:41:37,710 --> 01:41:39,130
He's maiden-less.

2513
01:41:45,400 --> 01:41:45,960
Yoink!

2514
01:41:46,020 --> 01:41:47,720
You're my soul now!

2515
01:41:48,600 --> 01:41:49,160
Yoink!

2516
01:41:51,040 --> 01:41:52,320
Oh my god!

2517
01:41:52,660 --> 01:41:55,020
Should've banged the fox lady!

2518
01:41:55,220 --> 01:41:56,940
Life would've been happier for you!

2519
01:41:57,140 --> 01:41:57,780
Not gonna lie!

2520
01:41:58,480 --> 01:42:03,100
I feel like life would've been happier for you if you banged the fox lady.

2521
01:42:06,540 --> 01:42:08,140
Talk to the fox lady again?

2522
01:42:08,180 --> 01:42:09,080
I am the fox lady.

2523
01:42:10,760 --> 01:42:12,900
Why would I need to talk to myself?

2524
01:42:16,480 --> 01:42:19,440
Is there like an incense near me, guys?

2525
01:42:19,780 --> 01:42:21,240
Or do I suffer?

2526
01:42:27,010 --> 01:42:27,750
Do I suffer?

2527
01:42:31,230 --> 01:42:33,770
Do I suffer?

2528
01:42:34,950 --> 01:42:36,130
Oh, I have instant TP.

2529
01:42:36,330 --> 01:42:36,630
Okay.

2530
01:42:36,730 --> 01:42:37,370
Thank god.

2531
01:42:37,550 --> 01:42:37,850
Okay.

2532
01:42:38,070 --> 01:42:42,070
I guess I suffer by going back to the temple again.

2533
01:42:43,450 --> 01:42:46,450
Oh, I have to be not fox lady to use it.

2534
01:42:46,530 --> 01:42:47,010
Alright.

2535
01:42:49,530 --> 01:42:50,390
Alright, confirm.

2536
01:42:55,620 --> 01:42:56,140
Alright.

2537
01:43:00,400 --> 01:43:01,860
Oh, fuck you, Tommy.

2538
01:43:02,040 --> 01:43:06,220
The entire palace area is a maze where I ran around for two hours.

2539
01:43:06,480 --> 01:43:07,040
Oh god.

2540
01:43:07,320 --> 01:43:09,160
Thank you for the super chat!

2541
01:43:09,160 --> 01:43:09,840
Thank you.

2542
01:43:10,140 --> 01:43:10,620
Thank you.

2543
01:43:14,620 --> 01:43:16,080
Alright, let's see.

2544
01:43:17,560 --> 01:43:20,260
Where is the dead fox lady?

2545
01:43:21,720 --> 01:43:22,600
Is it here?

2546
01:43:22,860 --> 01:43:24,380
Is it Longevity Road?

2547
01:43:26,880 --> 01:43:27,580
Where is it called?

2548
01:43:32,730 --> 01:43:34,350
Is it the Forest of Felicity?

2549
01:43:37,130 --> 01:43:38,710
Okay, Forest of Felicity.

2550
01:43:38,870 --> 01:43:39,270
Okay.

2551
01:43:39,270 --> 01:43:39,450
Okay.

2552
01:43:48,470 --> 01:43:49,570
Alright, here we go.

2553
01:43:50,350 --> 01:43:50,870
Hello.

2554
01:43:52,030 --> 01:43:52,950
I did it.

2555
01:43:59,910 --> 01:44:00,430
Woah,

2556
01:44:05,470 --> 01:44:07,490
you're gonna kill his fucking children.

2557
01:44:16,850 --> 01:44:20,290
I mean, like, he wasn't gonna take the 50-50, like...

2558
01:44:20,290 --> 01:44:20,890
Hey!

2559
01:44:21,470 --> 01:44:22,950
Like, yeah, he gets to...

2560
01:44:22,950 --> 01:44:24,830
bang hot fox lady.

2561
01:44:25,110 --> 01:44:26,930
But, like, there was a chance.

2562
01:44:27,810 --> 01:44:29,130
It was just a...

2563
01:44:29,130 --> 01:44:30,850
That was a very real dream.

2564
01:44:31,210 --> 01:44:31,990
That was...

2565
01:44:31,990 --> 01:44:34,350
That was a very real dream.

2566
01:44:37,670 --> 01:44:38,430
Alright.

2567
01:44:38,790 --> 01:44:39,990
50-50.

2568
01:44:41,590 --> 01:44:43,790
The man just did that weak.

2569
01:44:44,650 --> 01:44:46,250
He was weak!

2570
01:44:47,150 --> 01:44:48,650
He could...

2571
01:44:48,650 --> 01:44:50,330
Man, jeez.

2572
01:44:50,330 --> 01:44:50,890
I...

2573
01:44:50,890 --> 01:44:51,570
I...

2574
01:44:51,570 --> 01:44:51,770
I...

2575
01:44:51,770 --> 01:44:52,230
I...

2576
01:44:54,090 --> 01:44:55,330
Wait, how do I read the story?

2577
01:44:56,250 --> 01:44:57,230
Did it show up?

2578
01:45:00,250 --> 01:45:01,870
Losing 50-50.

2579
01:45:02,530 --> 01:45:03,670
Did it show up?

2580
01:45:03,690 --> 01:45:04,510
Is it the characters?

2581
01:45:04,930 --> 01:45:05,850
Oh, there it is.

2582
01:45:10,900 --> 01:45:11,340
Alright.

2583
01:45:11,520 --> 01:45:13,640
A fox subsided with Cephas' heart.

2584
01:45:13,700 --> 01:45:15,580
It ceased to pass the horizon, journeying far.

2585
01:45:15,700 --> 01:45:19,760
Yet fate unknown, her end draws near before it sees the stars.

2586
01:45:22,020 --> 01:45:24,160
Commune one above and become a fa- Oh, it's immortal!

2587
01:45:24,160 --> 01:45:25,700
You can't even kill her!

2588
01:45:28,300 --> 01:45:29,760
You can't even kill her!

2589
01:45:29,900 --> 01:45:30,460
She's immortal!

2590
01:45:34,320 --> 01:45:36,380
Oh, but it's very hard to become immortal.

2591
01:45:37,680 --> 01:45:40,660
You have to excel arts and philosophy to be immortal?

2592
01:45:41,140 --> 01:45:43,280
God, let me just be immortal then.

2593
01:45:45,940 --> 01:45:50,840
Once you transform, you can take the form of a beautiful woman or a handsome man.

2594
01:45:51,040 --> 01:45:53,180
And go to human towns to study and learn.

2595
01:45:53,180 --> 01:45:54,160
But remember this.

2596
01:45:54,360 --> 01:45:59,240
Lady of Mount Tai oversees all foxes and despises those who seduce and consume humans.

2597
01:45:59,440 --> 01:46:04,440
You must know that absorbing human essence is the quickest way for a Yaoguai to become powerful.

2598
01:46:04,740 --> 01:46:08,120
And if you wish to become a fox immortal, this path is forbidden.

2599
01:46:08,340 --> 01:46:11,920
You must set off a much more perilous and injurious path.

2600
01:46:12,360 --> 01:46:12,860
Alright.

2601
01:46:14,260 --> 01:46:14,800
Oh!

2602
01:46:18,130 --> 01:46:18,670
Oh!

2603
01:46:20,030 --> 01:46:22,230
She might not have ate him.

2604
01:46:22,350 --> 01:46:24,430
Because it was against the fox law.

2605
01:46:24,430 --> 01:46:26,450
It was against fox law.

2606
01:46:28,890 --> 01:46:29,450
So...

2607
01:46:30,770 --> 01:46:33,070
I mean, she could have fallen into the temptation.

2608
01:46:33,870 --> 01:46:35,130
You don't know that.

2609
01:46:35,670 --> 01:46:36,630
She could...

2610
01:46:36,630 --> 01:46:38,130
She might not...

2611
01:46:38,130 --> 01:46:40,150
Yeah, but she might not have ate him.

2612
01:46:40,350 --> 01:46:40,730
She...

2613
01:46:40,730 --> 01:46:42,650
I mean, living near humans...

2614
01:46:42,650 --> 01:46:45,230
Like, living near humans all the time...

2615
01:46:45,230 --> 01:46:46,650
Like, it only takes one hit.

2616
01:46:46,850 --> 01:46:47,430
It only...

2617
01:46:48,010 --> 01:46:50,910
What if she accidentally, like, slurped up some blood?

2618
01:46:51,330 --> 01:46:52,030
You know?

2619
01:46:52,890 --> 01:46:54,290
She could have, like...

2620
01:46:54,290 --> 01:46:58,470
She could have accidentally slurped up the blood and then transformed.

2621
01:46:58,890 --> 01:47:01,230
Because she's like, Wait, that's actually pretty good.

2622
01:47:01,590 --> 01:47:02,010
Like,

2623
01:47:06,030 --> 01:47:07,690
what if...

2624
01:47:07,690 --> 01:47:09,170
Like, that could have happened.

2625
01:47:10,430 --> 01:47:11,050
Yeah.

2626
01:47:11,310 --> 01:47:13,030
Stealing is against the law.

2627
01:47:13,190 --> 01:47:14,110
But they still...

2628
01:47:14,110 --> 01:47:16,270
But people still do it.

2629
01:47:19,610 --> 01:47:21,490
All it takes is one nipple.

2630
01:47:21,910 --> 01:47:23,270
That's all it takes.

2631
01:47:23,270 --> 01:47:25,490
One nipple and it's over.

2632
01:47:25,710 --> 01:47:27,250
It's over for her.

2633
01:47:28,230 --> 01:47:30,230
That was literally a 50-50.

2634
01:47:32,110 --> 01:47:34,930
Why are you so pessimistic?

2635
01:47:39,030 --> 01:47:40,930
50-50 are not good odds.

2636
01:47:41,070 --> 01:47:42,570
That's what I'm saying.

2637
01:47:44,810 --> 01:47:46,150
It's not that...

2638
01:47:46,150 --> 01:47:50,990
I'm just saying, 50-50 is, like, not the best odds you can have.

2639
01:47:53,270 --> 01:47:54,470
And we're not!

2640
01:47:54,690 --> 01:47:55,250
Gotcha!

2641
01:47:55,550 --> 01:47:58,230
Yeah, the RAM was 50-50 and look what...

2642
01:47:58,230 --> 01:48:03,610
Guys, it's because ever since the RAM, I could never trust any 50-50s ever again.

2643
01:48:03,870 --> 01:48:06,390
Ever since the RAM issue.

2644
01:48:06,530 --> 01:48:10,250
The RAM was 50-50 and look what happened to me.

2645
01:48:10,670 --> 01:48:19,230
I went to the PC store like three fucking times because of the RAM.

2646
01:48:20,770 --> 01:48:22,910
Wait, I don't get the paintbrush?

2647
01:48:23,270 --> 01:48:24,810
I lose the paintbrush forever?

2648
01:48:25,430 --> 01:48:26,330
That's fucked!

2649
01:48:27,190 --> 01:48:29,750
Why can't I keep you, fox lady?

2650
01:48:31,110 --> 01:48:33,070
I could have treated you right.

2651
01:48:34,710 --> 01:48:35,970
Oh, it's an equip.

2652
01:48:36,370 --> 01:48:37,290
Oh, okay, nice.

2653
01:48:38,130 --> 01:48:39,590
I want to be fox lady.

2654
01:48:42,170 --> 01:48:44,850
Oh, it turned into a curiosity item?

2655
01:48:45,710 --> 01:48:46,190
Alright.

2656
01:48:47,290 --> 01:48:47,870
Jesus!

2657
01:48:48,030 --> 01:48:49,250
Oh my god!

2658
01:48:49,430 --> 01:48:51,270
You're not fucking killing me!

2659
01:48:51,390 --> 01:48:52,570
I will heal, bitch!

2660
01:48:54,470 --> 01:48:55,630
Jesus Christ!

2661
01:48:56,050 --> 01:48:57,790
I miss being fox lady.

2662
01:48:59,170 --> 01:49:02,150
But fox lady let me walk past everything.

2663
01:49:02,790 --> 01:49:04,610
I don't want to fight them.

2664
01:49:04,790 --> 01:49:05,730
They're so annoying.

2665
01:49:09,690 --> 01:49:10,890
Alright, let's see.

2666
01:49:12,190 --> 01:49:12,830
Alright.

2667
01:49:12,970 --> 01:49:14,770
How do I become fox lady?

2668
01:49:16,550 --> 01:49:17,410
Where is it?

2669
01:49:17,450 --> 01:49:17,650
Is this?

2670
01:49:18,010 --> 01:49:18,250
No.

2671
01:49:19,290 --> 01:49:21,030
It increases critical hit chance.

2672
01:49:21,190 --> 01:49:21,590
Wait, what?

2673
01:49:21,950 --> 01:49:22,530
Oh, wait, no.

2674
01:49:22,530 --> 01:49:22,610
No.

2675
01:49:22,790 --> 01:49:23,950
Hit on empty void.

2676
01:49:24,170 --> 01:49:26,930
Land enough success hits to avoid the next fatal blow.

2677
01:49:27,210 --> 01:49:27,870
Oh, wait, it's this.

2678
01:49:28,990 --> 01:49:29,730
Modern increase.

2679
01:49:29,870 --> 01:49:30,790
Wait, that's good!

2680
01:49:31,410 --> 01:49:32,430
Wait, what's this?

2681
01:49:32,570 --> 01:49:34,250
When slightly reduced cooldown of spells.

2682
01:49:34,590 --> 01:49:35,370
Ah, fuck!

2683
01:49:35,570 --> 01:49:36,010
Okay.

2684
01:49:37,370 --> 01:49:39,390
The increases duration trans...

2685
01:49:39,390 --> 01:49:41,650
I'll just equip that for the...

2686
01:49:43,310 --> 01:49:43,750
Um...

2687
01:49:43,750 --> 01:49:44,730
That's not fair!

2688
01:49:45,230 --> 01:49:46,050
I can't...

2689
01:49:46,050 --> 01:49:47,470
Oh my god, you're right.

2690
01:49:47,510 --> 01:49:48,270
I should have went to...

2691
01:49:48,270 --> 01:49:50,510
Guys, now I know why you guys were like, go to the...

2692
01:49:50,510 --> 01:49:51,810
Go to the horse now!

2693
01:49:52,530 --> 01:49:53,830
Go to the horse now!

2694
01:49:54,550 --> 01:49:55,230
Because...

2695
01:49:56,390 --> 01:49:57,070
Because...

2696
01:49:58,470 --> 01:50:01,130
Because now I have to do this without fox lady.

2697
01:50:01,550 --> 01:50:03,310
Alright, where's the horse?

2698
01:50:04,730 --> 01:50:06,490
I'm not gonna fight the tiger!

2699
01:50:07,090 --> 01:50:08,330
I'm not gonna get...

2700
01:50:08,330 --> 01:50:11,870
I'm gonna upgrade my weapon first before I fight the tiger.

2701
01:50:15,370 --> 01:50:16,510
Alright, where's the horse?

2702
01:50:18,030 --> 01:50:18,810
Is it the...

2703
01:50:18,810 --> 01:50:20,390
Same place?

2704
01:50:20,570 --> 01:50:20,930
Okay.

2705
01:50:27,030 --> 01:50:28,250
Trans Okay, that's fine.

2706
01:50:29,010 --> 01:50:30,190
He can't get me?

2707
01:50:30,230 --> 01:50:31,070
He's fucking blind.

2708
01:50:33,650 --> 01:50:34,210
Okay...

2709
01:50:36,750 --> 01:50:41,050
Wait, the horse wasn't there?

2710
01:50:41,370 --> 01:50:43,170
What do you mean the horse wasn't there?

2711
01:50:44,350 --> 01:50:45,210
What do you mean?

2712
01:50:45,250 --> 01:50:46,410
There's different horses?

2713
01:50:49,030 --> 01:50:50,330
Where would the horse be?

2714
01:50:51,750 --> 01:50:54,230
I have to go back to chapter... oh my god.

2715
01:50:55,450 --> 01:50:57,730
Go back to chapter one.

2716
01:50:57,990 --> 01:50:59,290
Who the fuck is he?

2717
01:50:59,510 --> 01:51:02,690
Who the fuck is he?

2718
01:51:08,570 --> 01:51:10,110
Now there's a horse.

2719
01:51:11,250 --> 01:51:12,870
Who are you?

2720
01:51:12,910 --> 01:51:16,170
Let me finish chapter three you fucking horse!

2721
01:51:18,390 --> 01:51:20,370
Okay, what do we do?

2722
01:51:21,430 --> 01:51:23,130
What do we do?

2723
01:51:24,510 --> 01:51:25,650
Where is he?

2724
01:51:30,550 --> 01:51:31,610
Where is he?

2725
01:51:32,630 --> 01:51:33,870
Where is he guys?

2726
01:51:36,410 --> 01:51:37,810
Where the fuck is he?

2727
01:51:37,950 --> 01:51:39,370
Give it to me.

2728
01:51:40,370 --> 01:51:41,750
Black Hill Shrine.

2729
01:51:42,630 --> 01:51:44,070
Where the fuck is Black Hill Shrine?

2730
01:51:46,330 --> 01:51:47,510
One of the meditation?

2731
01:51:48,510 --> 01:51:50,530
Somewhere in Bamboo Grove.

2732
01:51:50,950 --> 01:51:51,410
Okay.

2733
01:51:52,730 --> 01:51:53,650
Okay.

2734
01:51:55,730 --> 01:51:58,530
Alright, where the fuck is...

2735
01:51:58,530 --> 01:52:02,030
What the fuck is somewhere in Bamboo Grove?

2736
01:52:02,570 --> 01:52:04,650
That is not enough information.

2737
01:52:05,550 --> 01:52:06,470
Alright,

2738
01:52:11,470 --> 01:52:12,610
we can do this.

2739
01:52:12,630 --> 01:52:13,350
I am strong.

2740
01:52:18,280 --> 01:52:19,360
To the left.

2741
01:52:19,760 --> 01:52:20,880
To the left.

2742
01:52:20,920 --> 01:52:21,640
To the left.

2743
01:52:23,060 --> 01:52:25,260
I feel like this game is like...

2744
01:52:25,260 --> 01:52:26,640
The game realizes you're like...

2745
01:52:26,640 --> 01:52:28,260
You're actually lost.

2746
01:52:28,460 --> 01:52:31,480
It just gives you the yellow fly thing.

2747
01:52:31,620 --> 01:52:32,080
Is he here?

2748
01:52:34,580 --> 01:52:35,620
Is he in here?

2749
01:52:36,660 --> 01:52:38,080
Horseman, where are you?

2750
01:52:43,340 --> 01:52:44,160
Is he here?

2751
01:52:52,220 --> 01:52:53,200
To the left.

2752
01:52:53,240 --> 01:52:53,960
To the left.

2753
01:52:55,800 --> 01:52:56,480
Horseman.

2754
01:52:58,060 --> 01:52:58,740
Horseman.

2755
01:52:58,740 --> 01:53:00,080
Oh hey, I didn't get this chest.

2756
01:53:01,060 --> 01:53:01,740
Okay.

2757
01:53:02,760 --> 01:53:03,100
Loot.

2758
01:53:03,220 --> 01:53:04,420
Loot I didn't get.

2759
01:53:07,980 --> 01:53:08,660
Alright.

2760
01:53:09,820 --> 01:53:11,160
At least I got loot.

2761
01:53:11,620 --> 01:53:12,300
At least I got loot.

2762
01:53:12,320 --> 01:53:14,160
Okay, the opposite way.

2763
01:53:15,480 --> 01:53:16,160
Abago.

2764
01:53:18,440 --> 01:53:19,120
Okay.

2765
01:53:19,880 --> 01:53:20,860
This way.

2766
01:53:22,360 --> 01:53:23,040
Okay.

2767
01:53:23,040 --> 01:53:23,220
Okay.

2768
01:53:23,900 --> 01:53:25,480
And then down.

2769
01:53:26,380 --> 01:53:27,020
Abago.

2770
01:53:29,920 --> 01:53:31,880
And then to the left.

2771
01:53:31,900 --> 01:53:32,600
To the left.

2772
01:53:36,500 --> 01:53:37,140
Here.

2773
01:53:39,180 --> 01:53:40,400
Is this it?

2774
01:53:41,900 --> 01:53:43,420
Oh, are you Horseman?

2775
01:53:44,540 --> 01:53:45,180
Whoa!

2776
01:53:46,240 --> 01:53:50,280
Did I steal your stuff?

2777
01:53:50,940 --> 01:53:51,780
Oh no.

2778
01:53:52,560 --> 01:53:53,080
Okay.

2779
01:53:54,480 --> 01:53:55,000
Alright.

2780
01:53:55,200 --> 01:53:56,720
That's furry bait right there.

2781
01:54:03,460 --> 01:54:03,980
Bro,

2782
01:54:08,440 --> 01:54:09,600
why are you so jacked?

2783
01:54:09,660 --> 01:54:11,900
Bro, he has veins on his fucking foot.

2784
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:21,260
Bro, did you see those veins on his fucking hooves?

2785
01:54:21,380 --> 01:54:21,780
Geez.

2786
01:54:25,680 --> 01:54:30,520
Oh, is that your weapon?

2787
01:54:31,440 --> 01:54:33,180
Are you carrying a whip?

2788
01:54:34,840 --> 01:54:36,240
Oh, I already killed him.

2789
01:54:41,340 --> 01:54:43,080
Already killed that guy.

2790
01:54:43,320 --> 01:54:44,360
Already killed that guy.

2791
01:54:44,740 --> 01:54:46,460
Already killed that guy.

2792
01:54:47,780 --> 01:54:48,540
Oh, I already killed that guy.

2793
01:54:48,540 --> 01:54:51,080
The dragoons really wanted to see you, and now I know why.

2794
01:54:52,140 --> 01:54:54,980
Alright, goodbye.

2795
01:54:56,120 --> 01:54:56,640
Alright.

2796
01:54:57,020 --> 01:55:00,700
The dragoons really wanted me to meet you, and now I know why.

2797
01:55:01,020 --> 01:55:02,200
Now I know why.

2798
01:55:07,660 --> 01:55:09,460
I get it too!

2799
01:55:12,680 --> 01:55:14,120
Oh wait, can I meditate?

2800
01:55:14,120 --> 01:55:16,700
Oh wait, I was supposed to meditate there?

2801
01:55:18,380 --> 01:55:19,580
Oh wait, I was supposed to meditate there?

2802
01:55:19,580 --> 01:55:20,720
Was there a meditation there?

2803
01:55:21,040 --> 01:55:21,640
Was there a meditation there?

2804
01:55:21,640 --> 01:55:23,840
I didn't even realize.

2805
01:55:23,980 --> 01:55:25,840
Whoopskiss, I gotta go back again.

2806
01:55:26,840 --> 01:55:26,960
I didn't even realize.

2807
01:55:26,960 --> 01:55:26,960
Whoopskiss, I gotta go back again.

2808
01:55:28,480 --> 01:55:29,520
I'm mad.

2809
01:55:29,560 --> 01:55:30,300
I'm mad.

2810
01:55:30,300 --> 01:55:32,260
Thank you for the secret chat.

2811
01:55:32,260 --> 01:55:32,780
Thank you.

2812
01:55:33,920 --> 01:55:34,520
Alright.

2813
01:55:37,500 --> 01:55:39,720
Where the fuck is the meditation spot?

2814
01:55:40,120 --> 01:55:41,000
Oh, there it is.

2815
01:55:48,550 --> 01:55:49,970
Whoa, wolf box!

2816
01:55:50,430 --> 01:55:51,070
Whoa!

2817
01:55:55,750 --> 01:55:57,950
That was a jacked horse.

2818
01:56:00,570 --> 01:56:02,270
I'm glad he was wearing...

2819
01:56:02,270 --> 01:56:03,970
I'm glad he was wearing pants.

2820
01:56:07,090 --> 01:56:10,210
I'm glad he's one of the animals that actually wore clothes.

2821
01:56:10,730 --> 01:56:11,370
Alright.

2822
01:56:11,630 --> 01:56:12,270
Alright.

2823
01:56:18,920 --> 01:56:19,400
Nice.

2824
01:56:20,380 --> 01:56:20,920
Nice.

2825
01:56:20,980 --> 01:56:23,180
I didn't want to meditate while he was watching me.

2826
01:56:23,320 --> 01:56:24,920
I felt weird.

2827
01:56:26,920 --> 01:56:28,300
I didn't want to meditate while he was watching me.

2828
01:56:28,300 --> 01:56:30,040
I know some of you freaks would have liked that.

2829
01:56:30,240 --> 01:56:34,700
I know some of you freaks would have liked that.

2830
01:56:34,700 --> 01:56:35,740
Okay, chapter two.

2831
01:56:39,650 --> 01:56:40,190
Alright.

2832
01:56:40,610 --> 01:56:41,710
Chapter two time!

2833
01:56:42,390 --> 01:56:43,230
Where is it?

2834
01:56:48,030 --> 01:56:49,450
Where is it?

2835
01:56:49,470 --> 01:56:50,150
Where is it in the first...

2836
01:56:50,150 --> 01:56:52,090
Is it village entrance or...

2837
01:56:52,090 --> 01:56:53,270
Where was it?

2838
01:56:54,590 --> 01:56:55,450
Village entrance?

2839
01:56:55,850 --> 01:56:56,030
Okay.

2840
01:57:07,570 --> 01:57:08,170
Alright.

2841
01:57:08,270 --> 01:57:10,150
Off we go to the village entrance.

2842
01:57:15,860 --> 01:57:16,460
Alright.

2843
01:57:16,520 --> 01:57:18,140
Where was the mini boss?

2844
01:57:18,340 --> 01:57:20,580
Okay, that was the frog guy, right?

2845
01:57:21,700 --> 01:57:22,880
Near the frogs?

2846
01:57:23,400 --> 01:57:25,100
Near the frogs?

2847
01:57:25,180 --> 01:57:25,780
Here?

2848
01:57:32,060 --> 01:57:33,180
Or like...

2849
01:57:33,180 --> 01:57:33,740
Or like...

2850
01:57:33,740 --> 01:57:36,860
Oh, the earth dog!

2851
01:57:37,200 --> 01:57:40,060
Oh, that village... that boss!

2852
01:57:40,720 --> 01:57:42,820
The fucking dog that looked like a rat.

2853
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:43,620
That guy.

2854
01:57:43,800 --> 01:57:44,740
Okay, I remember him.

2855
01:57:45,340 --> 01:57:45,900
Alright.

2856
01:57:47,200 --> 01:57:49,240
The fucking dog-rat thing.

2857
01:57:52,680 --> 01:57:53,840
It should be here.

2858
01:57:57,100 --> 01:57:58,200
Alright, over here.

2859
01:57:58,980 --> 01:57:59,820
I've trained.

2860
01:58:00,180 --> 01:58:00,940
There we go.

2861
01:58:01,120 --> 01:58:02,540
You should be like super weak.

2862
01:58:02,620 --> 01:58:03,060
Right now.

2863
01:58:03,140 --> 01:58:05,260
Like you should be dead dead.

2864
01:58:05,940 --> 01:58:07,120
Alright, horse man.

2865
01:58:11,160 --> 01:58:12,620
What the fuck were you talking to?

2866
01:58:18,980 --> 01:58:19,940
My dragoons.

2867
01:58:20,640 --> 01:58:22,440
They really want to see you again.

2868
01:58:29,160 --> 01:58:30,680
Oh, so you're tied up.

2869
01:58:30,800 --> 01:58:31,960
How did they tie you up?

2870
01:58:32,620 --> 01:58:33,540
Look at you!

2871
01:58:33,760 --> 01:58:33,880
Look at you!

2872
01:58:34,720 --> 01:58:35,900
Look at you!

2873
01:58:35,900 --> 01:58:36,220
Look at you!

2874
01:58:37,780 --> 01:58:38,500
Look at you!

2875
01:58:39,200 --> 01:58:39,920
Look at you!

2876
01:58:44,120 --> 01:58:45,120
He is.

2877
01:58:45,580 --> 01:58:46,300
Bro!

2878
01:58:47,480 --> 01:58:49,680
You look so vulnerable right now.

2879
01:58:49,920 --> 01:58:51,740
He is really vulnerable.

2880
01:59:01,860 --> 01:59:02,500
Yeah.

2881
01:59:07,560 --> 01:59:08,840
Please stop.

2882
01:59:10,900 --> 01:59:12,980
These rats are no match for me.

2883
01:59:13,060 --> 01:59:15,420
Then how the fuck did you get tied up?

2884
01:59:16,260 --> 01:59:19,340
Even though you are a beast, you can't get away with it.

2885
01:59:20,540 --> 01:59:23,360
I wonder what he said in English.

2886
01:59:27,360 --> 01:59:28,440
That's a good question.

2887
01:59:30,060 --> 01:59:32,780
Wait, how are you going to get out?

2888
01:59:35,180 --> 01:59:37,780
Are you going to... No, I can't talk to him no more.

2889
01:59:37,900 --> 01:59:39,520
I want to know what he said in English.

2890
01:59:40,800 --> 01:59:42,480
I want to know it.

2891
01:59:45,440 --> 01:59:46,960
What the fuck?

2892
01:59:46,960 --> 01:59:48,760
How is he like stuck?

2893
01:59:49,340 --> 01:59:50,180
Oh, use fire?

2894
01:59:50,620 --> 01:59:51,680
Okay, I'll be back.

2895
01:59:56,240 --> 01:59:58,400
Do I untie him?

2896
01:59:58,580 --> 01:59:59,700
Or does he untie himself?

2897
02:00:00,480 --> 02:00:03,800
He's acting helpless to lower the guard.

2898
02:00:04,760 --> 02:00:06,340
He's like, don't worry, I can take it.

2899
02:00:06,340 --> 02:00:07,340
Then how did you get caught?

2900
02:00:07,800 --> 02:00:10,640
How the fuck did you get caught?

2901
02:00:12,800 --> 02:00:13,360
Okay.

2902
02:00:13,360 --> 02:00:16,400
Apparently, I can talk to him again.

2903
02:00:16,600 --> 02:00:17,220
Okay, let's see.

2904
02:00:17,360 --> 02:00:17,960
I'll check.

2905
02:00:18,260 --> 02:00:19,720
I'll double check him.

2906
02:00:21,720 --> 02:00:24,160
Like, that rope shouldn't be able to hold you down.

2907
02:00:26,660 --> 02:00:27,440
Oh, I can.

2908
02:00:27,700 --> 02:00:28,060
Okay.

2909
02:00:28,560 --> 02:00:29,080
Alright.

2910
02:00:29,420 --> 02:00:31,100
The dragoons need to know.

2911
02:00:31,820 --> 02:00:33,820
What do you sound like in English?

2912
02:00:45,690 --> 02:00:46,190
It's silent.

2913
02:00:46,390 --> 02:00:47,470
How odd.

2914
02:00:47,950 --> 02:00:50,570
Who would swear fealty to such a thing?

2915
02:00:50,970 --> 02:00:54,090
You know what he reminds me of?

2916
02:00:54,970 --> 02:00:57,310
You know what his voice reminds me of?

2917
02:00:57,530 --> 02:00:59,030
Fifty Shades of Grey.

2918
02:00:59,250 --> 02:01:00,230
These rats are no match for me.

2919
02:01:00,310 --> 02:01:02,350
The guy from Fifty Shades of Grey.

2920
02:01:03,450 --> 02:01:06,590
He literally sort of sounds like him.

2921
02:01:12,130 --> 02:01:12,810
No!

2922
02:01:13,030 --> 02:01:13,510
No!

2923
02:01:13,890 --> 02:01:14,570
No!

2924
02:01:15,970 --> 02:01:18,570
This place is a jumble of rats and cats.

2925
02:01:19,130 --> 02:01:19,730
Stop!

2926
02:01:20,890 --> 02:01:22,650
You've ruined him!

2927
02:01:27,110 --> 02:01:28,690
Switch it back!

2928
02:01:30,470 --> 02:01:31,070
No!

2929
02:01:31,290 --> 02:01:33,310
Why did you have to ruin the horse?

2930
02:01:36,870 --> 02:01:40,130
I knew what he sounds like because I saw the trailer.

2931
02:01:40,330 --> 02:01:43,950
I didn't watch the movie because, like, I'm not into that.

2932
02:01:43,950 --> 02:01:44,870
Like...

2933
02:01:45,650 --> 02:01:46,170
Um...

2934
02:01:46,170 --> 02:01:51,090
The funniest shit I know about the movie is that the two actors hated each other so much.

2935
02:01:51,190 --> 02:01:53,090
They literally did the movie for a paycheck.

2936
02:01:53,210 --> 02:01:54,970
They did not like each other.

2937
02:01:59,790 --> 02:02:01,070
Because it was a meme!

2938
02:02:01,230 --> 02:02:03,110
That movie was a fucking meme!

2939
02:02:07,210 --> 02:02:09,130
It was literally...

2940
02:02:09,130 --> 02:02:11,490
The whole Fifty Shades of...

2941
02:02:11,490 --> 02:02:12,010
Nay.

2942
02:02:12,950 --> 02:02:14,690
Thank you for the super chat.

2943
02:02:14,770 --> 02:02:15,050
Thank you.

2944
02:02:15,110 --> 02:02:15,650
Thank you.

2945
02:02:15,710 --> 02:02:16,670
The whole...

2946
02:02:16,670 --> 02:02:18,970
The whole fucking premise was...

2947
02:02:18,990 --> 02:02:19,910
That fucking...

2948
02:02:19,910 --> 02:02:20,730
Move...

2949
02:02:20,730 --> 02:02:24,330
This book was based off of a Twilight fanfiction.

2950
02:02:27,410 --> 02:02:27,990
Okay.

2951
02:02:28,210 --> 02:02:29,130
We gotta go this way.

2952
02:02:31,830 --> 02:02:35,230
That's another reason why you would watch that movie.

2953
02:02:38,720 --> 02:02:39,010
Yeah!

2954
02:02:39,270 --> 02:02:40,630
It was literally...

2955
02:02:40,630 --> 02:02:44,330
She literally wrote that on, like, I don't know, Wattpad or some shit.

2956
02:02:44,550 --> 02:02:48,390
She, like, uploaded on, like, Wattpad or either fanfiction.net.

2957
02:02:48,390 --> 02:02:49,450
I don't fucking remember.

2958
02:02:49,750 --> 02:02:50,810
It was like a...

2959
02:02:50,810 --> 02:02:51,470
It was...

2960
02:02:51,470 --> 02:02:54,090
It was an Edward Bella Twilight fanfiction.

2961
02:02:54,330 --> 02:02:56,830
And then, like, she made it into a book.

2962
02:02:57,170 --> 02:02:57,690
Like...

2963
02:02:58,750 --> 02:03:01,250
And then she changed the names.

2964
02:03:01,430 --> 02:03:04,170
And then made it into a fucking book.

2965
02:03:08,680 --> 02:03:09,760
The worst part?

2966
02:03:09,860 --> 02:03:10,600
It was a mid...

2967
02:03:10,600 --> 02:03:12,980
Oh, how do you know that, D-Dragon?

2968
02:03:13,200 --> 02:03:15,940
How the fuck do you know it was a mid...

2969
02:03:17,100 --> 02:03:17,620
Fanfiction.

2970
02:03:18,100 --> 02:03:20,320
I didn't even read the fanfiction.

2971
02:03:21,200 --> 02:03:22,400
So how do you know?

2972
02:03:26,120 --> 02:03:26,940
Let's see.

2973
02:03:27,400 --> 02:03:28,680
Do we go up?

2974
02:03:29,940 --> 02:03:31,360
Oh no, it's the blind man.

2975
02:03:32,120 --> 02:03:33,780
It's the blind man.

2976
02:03:35,140 --> 02:03:35,700
Whoa.

2977
02:03:36,480 --> 02:03:37,620
Can't catch me.

2978
02:03:37,860 --> 02:03:39,300
We're too blind for that.

2979
02:03:39,620 --> 02:03:40,820
That's fucking right.

2980
02:03:42,280 --> 02:03:42,840
Alright.

2981
02:03:43,880 --> 02:03:45,120
Now where do I go?

2982
02:03:46,740 --> 02:03:48,220
Now where's the horseman?

2983
02:03:49,820 --> 02:03:50,460
Horseman!

2984
02:03:51,100 --> 02:03:52,160
Oh, left side.

2985
02:03:52,260 --> 02:03:52,480
Okay.

2986
02:03:53,960 --> 02:03:54,920
Left side.

2987
02:03:59,230 --> 02:03:59,930
That's it?

2988
02:04:01,690 --> 02:04:02,310
Is it here?

2989
02:04:03,370 --> 02:04:04,490
Where's horseman?

2990
02:04:05,690 --> 02:04:07,250
Where the fuck is horseman?

2991
02:04:08,490 --> 02:04:09,450
Other way?

2992
02:04:09,630 --> 02:04:11,410
Is my left not your left?

2993
02:04:15,280 --> 02:04:16,520
Is it this left?

2994
02:04:17,020 --> 02:04:18,920
No, it's the other side left.

2995
02:04:19,480 --> 02:04:21,260
Is my left this left?

2996
02:04:24,780 --> 02:04:26,180
Is this the left?

2997
02:04:31,880 --> 02:04:32,780
Wait, what?

2998
02:04:37,940 --> 02:04:39,360
He's in the house?

2999
02:04:40,200 --> 02:04:40,880
What house?

3000
02:04:41,660 --> 02:04:42,660
Is that him?

3001
02:04:43,940 --> 02:04:45,320
Wait, there he is!

3002
02:04:46,660 --> 02:04:47,940
I see you!

3003
02:04:49,140 --> 02:04:50,640
Hey there, big boy.

3004
02:04:53,700 --> 02:04:55,120
I'm your friend!

3005
02:05:15,080 --> 02:05:17,880
No more?

3006
02:05:18,180 --> 02:05:20,120
No more?

3007
02:05:22,680 --> 02:05:23,420
No more?

3008
02:05:23,420 --> 02:05:24,740
What the fuck are those thoughts?

3009
02:05:41,020 --> 02:05:43,120
Because he's not wearing underneath that.

3010
02:05:43,200 --> 02:05:44,220
Nothing underneath that, guys.

3011
02:05:44,340 --> 02:05:46,560
I just realized he's not wearing anything, guys.

3012
02:05:48,160 --> 02:05:49,520
He's not wearing anything.

3013
02:05:56,140 --> 02:05:58,460
Oh, he really was, huh?

3014
02:06:07,520 --> 02:06:08,100
Okay,

3015
02:06:14,040 --> 02:06:14,300
sure.

3016
02:06:14,580 --> 02:06:16,000
We can be best friends forever.

3017
02:06:16,520 --> 02:06:18,120
Maybe even more than that.

3018
02:06:20,480 --> 02:06:22,120
Okay, where do I go now?

3019
02:06:24,040 --> 02:06:25,540
Starts with friendship first.

3020
02:06:27,700 --> 02:06:29,320
Wait, is there a meditation here?

3021
02:06:29,620 --> 02:06:30,520
Oh, shit.

3022
02:06:30,980 --> 02:06:32,120
There's a gift here.

3023
02:06:33,480 --> 02:06:35,880
Did anyone tell you you're nuts?

3024
02:06:36,460 --> 02:06:38,940
Kyle, thank you for the super chat.

3025
02:06:39,100 --> 02:06:40,180
Thank you, thank you.

3026
02:06:42,220 --> 02:06:43,880
Okay, we're in, guys.

3027
02:06:44,280 --> 02:06:45,020
We're in.

3028
02:06:46,660 --> 02:06:48,820
Guys, we're fucking in, guys.

3029
02:06:49,020 --> 02:06:49,920
We're in.

3030
02:06:50,640 --> 02:06:51,860
Where do I go?

3031
02:06:52,360 --> 02:06:53,420
Oh, I guess I'll do the chest.

3032
02:06:54,740 --> 02:06:55,940
I'll open this chest.

3033
02:06:57,980 --> 02:06:59,120
Yay, chest!

3034
02:07:02,280 --> 02:07:03,500
I don't know where to go.

3035
02:07:03,600 --> 02:07:04,580
I'm, like, forever lost.

3036
02:07:05,580 --> 02:07:07,340
Oh, there's a meditation spot here.

3037
02:07:10,120 --> 02:07:12,200
Is that a meditation spot or is that loot?

3038
02:07:14,080 --> 02:07:14,880
Oh, it's loot.

3039
02:07:15,560 --> 02:07:16,540
God damn it!

3040
02:07:16,620 --> 02:07:17,540
God damn it!

3041
02:07:17,780 --> 02:07:18,760
Come on, guys!

3042
02:07:18,900 --> 02:07:20,060
Let me have this loot!

3043
02:07:20,120 --> 02:07:21,560
It's literally just sitting there!

3044
02:07:21,560 --> 02:07:24,520
You guys weren't even gonna do anything with it!

3045
02:07:24,680 --> 02:07:26,480
Come on, you know that!

3046
02:07:27,100 --> 02:07:29,520
You guys weren't gonna do anything anyway!

3047
02:07:30,240 --> 02:07:32,520
I swear to fucking God.

3048
02:07:35,500 --> 02:07:38,580
Please, let me use this once.

3049
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:40,440
Oh, my God!

3050
02:07:40,620 --> 02:07:42,780
Are the twins gonna kill me?

3051
02:07:46,400 --> 02:07:47,520
Jesus Christ!

3052
02:07:47,860 --> 02:07:48,860
This is it.

3053
02:07:48,960 --> 02:07:49,740
No more...

3054
02:07:49,740 --> 02:07:51,280
No more nice monkeys.

3055
02:07:52,140 --> 02:07:53,460
Multiple monkey time.

3056
02:07:54,060 --> 02:07:55,080
That's fucking right.

3057
02:07:55,220 --> 02:07:55,700
You go.

3058
02:07:56,040 --> 02:07:57,120
Go do your thing.

3059
02:07:58,540 --> 02:08:00,700
You do your thing and then I'm gonna fucking...

3060
02:08:00,700 --> 02:08:02,620
I'm gonna kill this guy in particular.

3061
02:08:03,600 --> 02:08:05,760
No, no, I didn't die to mobs.

3062
02:08:05,820 --> 02:08:07,360
It has not happened, guys.

3063
02:08:08,180 --> 02:08:09,880
It has not happened!

3064
02:08:11,160 --> 02:08:13,780
I'm just trying to kill this one fucking guy!

3065
02:08:14,500 --> 02:08:15,400
There we go.

3066
02:08:17,160 --> 02:08:18,440
Alright, there we go.

3067
02:08:18,480 --> 02:08:20,800
I used all that just for this fucking mob.

3068
02:08:25,410 --> 02:08:25,850
Oh!

3069
02:08:26,230 --> 02:08:26,810
Maximum stamina.

3070
02:08:27,190 --> 02:08:28,010
It was worth it.

3071
02:08:28,710 --> 02:08:29,150
Nice.

3072
02:08:29,450 --> 02:08:30,650
It was worth it too.

3073
02:08:30,810 --> 02:08:31,810
Wait, are you a mini-boss?

3074
02:08:31,910 --> 02:08:32,810
Who the fuck are you?

3075
02:08:34,010 --> 02:08:35,130
What the fuck?

3076
02:08:35,170 --> 02:08:36,270
What the fuck?

3077
02:08:36,430 --> 02:08:37,430
Who are you?

3078
02:08:39,550 --> 02:08:40,330
Oh, shit.

3079
02:08:40,430 --> 02:08:40,630
Whoops.

3080
02:08:41,190 --> 02:08:42,430
Sorry, I did not mean...

3081
02:08:44,130 --> 02:08:45,850
That's not what I wanted to do.

3082
02:08:46,710 --> 02:08:48,330
That was actually an accident.

3083
02:08:48,970 --> 02:08:49,890
Who are you?

3084
02:08:50,010 --> 02:08:51,030
I've never seen you before.

3085
02:08:51,650 --> 02:08:52,730
There's so many legs.

3086
02:08:54,010 --> 02:08:54,830
Oh, shit.

3087
02:08:56,730 --> 02:08:59,970
Okay, I just wanted to do that and then...

3088
02:08:59,970 --> 02:09:03,170
I might not be as strong because you're also fire, but that's okay.

3089
02:09:04,290 --> 02:09:05,730
I've never seen him before.

3090
02:09:05,870 --> 02:09:06,990
Who the fuck is this guy?

3091
02:09:07,350 --> 02:09:07,630
Whoa!

3092
02:09:08,850 --> 02:09:09,550
That's fine.

3093
02:09:10,810 --> 02:09:11,310
Easy.

3094
02:09:11,770 --> 02:09:13,390
Oh, I got arm guards!

3095
02:09:13,610 --> 02:09:14,590
Let's fucking go.

3096
02:09:16,990 --> 02:09:19,370
Might be like a mini-boss or some shit.

3097
02:09:21,590 --> 02:09:22,090
Damn.

3098
02:09:22,090 --> 02:09:23,490
Oh, what the fuck?

3099
02:09:23,530 --> 02:09:24,950
You have feces on your knees?

3100
02:09:25,790 --> 02:09:27,390
What the fuck are you?

3101
02:09:30,960 --> 02:09:34,420
She got the drops at the first try like it's hard?

3102
02:09:35,820 --> 02:09:36,360
Okay,

3103
02:09:39,650 --> 02:09:40,610
I'm gonna kill this guy.

3104
02:09:42,750 --> 02:09:43,450
All right.

3105
02:09:43,630 --> 02:09:44,410
Get out.

3106
02:09:45,550 --> 02:09:46,910
I don't even...

3107
02:09:46,910 --> 02:09:49,010
He's got the gamer knees.

3108
02:09:50,510 --> 02:09:52,390
Bro, he's fucking gaming right now.

3109
02:09:54,490 --> 02:09:55,230
Oh, no.

3110
02:09:55,290 --> 02:09:55,570
Oh, no.

3111
02:09:55,570 --> 02:09:55,650
Oh, no.

3112
02:09:55,650 --> 02:09:55,710
Oh, no.

3113
02:09:55,710 --> 02:09:55,770
Oh, no.

3114
02:09:55,770 --> 02:09:57,470
No, no!

3115
02:09:58,230 --> 02:09:59,010
There we go.

3116
02:09:59,210 --> 02:09:59,770
Yes.

3117
02:10:01,810 --> 02:10:02,970
What was he guarding?

3118
02:10:03,190 --> 02:10:04,430
Wait, that wasn't even anything.

3119
02:10:05,130 --> 02:10:06,810
He was guarding nothing!

3120
02:10:10,590 --> 02:10:11,150
What?

3121
02:10:12,430 --> 02:10:13,170
All right.

3122
02:10:13,590 --> 02:10:15,270
He was actually guarding nothing.

3123
02:10:16,050 --> 02:10:17,310
So I can just leave.

3124
02:10:19,110 --> 02:10:20,230
Melon quest time.

3125
02:10:20,350 --> 02:10:21,430
Did I get everything here?

3126
02:10:21,690 --> 02:10:23,050
Is there any extra loot?

3127
02:10:23,050 --> 02:10:27,830
Dude, what the fuck are you... God damn it, leave me alone.

3128
02:10:28,850 --> 02:10:30,970
I'm best friends with a horse, leave me alone.

3129
02:10:32,930 --> 02:10:34,110
Am I missing anything?

3130
02:10:35,630 --> 02:10:36,610
I got everything?

3131
02:10:38,030 --> 02:10:39,690
Is there any loot that I'm missing?

3132
02:10:44,530 --> 02:10:45,910
I'm not missing anything, right?

3133
02:10:47,150 --> 02:10:48,090
There's a transformation?

3134
02:10:48,570 --> 02:10:48,770
Where?

3135
02:10:50,290 --> 02:10:51,130
Where is it?

3136
02:10:54,780 --> 02:10:56,300
Go to the main boss?

3137
02:10:58,300 --> 02:10:59,540
I missed a pet?

3138
02:11:00,080 --> 02:11:00,400
Okay.

3139
02:11:01,140 --> 02:11:02,140
Who said that?

3140
02:11:03,720 --> 02:11:04,760
Who said that?

3141
02:11:04,980 --> 02:11:06,620
Who said that?

3142
02:11:08,140 --> 02:11:09,340
Oh, temple entrance?

3143
02:11:09,640 --> 02:11:09,880
Okay.

3144
02:11:13,420 --> 02:11:13,980
Okay.

3145
02:11:14,380 --> 02:11:15,860
I'm just gonna head here first.

3146
02:11:16,500 --> 02:11:18,820
Did I miss anything at the...

3147
02:11:19,700 --> 02:11:20,640
Up there?

3148
02:11:20,800 --> 02:11:21,920
Did I miss anything up there?

3149
02:11:22,260 --> 02:11:22,820
Guys?

3150
02:11:22,920 --> 02:11:23,660
No, right?

3151
02:11:27,970 --> 02:11:29,330
I'm gonna double check, actually.

3152
02:11:30,670 --> 02:11:31,110
Yeah?

3153
02:11:31,310 --> 02:11:32,510
Okay, I'm gonna go back in.

3154
02:11:34,250 --> 02:11:35,110
That's fucking right.

3155
02:11:35,190 --> 02:11:36,490
I'm coming back in to beat you up.

3156
02:11:36,910 --> 02:11:37,910
No wizards allowed.

3157
02:11:39,070 --> 02:11:39,930
That's fucking right.

3158
02:11:40,010 --> 02:11:41,390
No wizards allowed up here.

3159
02:11:41,950 --> 02:11:43,530
This is a wizard free zone.

3160
02:11:45,490 --> 02:11:46,190
Alright, nice.

3161
02:11:47,110 --> 02:11:47,550
Alright.

3162
02:11:48,950 --> 02:11:49,570
Let's see.

3163
02:11:49,730 --> 02:11:51,770
I'm just gonna make sure I didn't miss anything here.

3164
02:11:52,450 --> 02:11:53,330
No, there's nothing.

3165
02:11:53,510 --> 02:11:54,310
It's just paper.

3166
02:11:55,250 --> 02:11:56,250
There's nothing here.

3167
02:11:56,370 --> 02:11:57,110
You guys lied!

3168
02:11:58,330 --> 02:11:59,670
It's just paper!

3169
02:12:00,910 --> 02:12:01,790
Look up?

3170
02:12:01,890 --> 02:12:03,130
Why would I need to look up?

3171
02:12:05,070 --> 02:12:06,110
Free paper.

3172
02:12:07,890 --> 02:12:09,050
Doki, you don't understand.

3173
02:12:09,190 --> 02:12:10,110
It's free paper.

3174
02:12:13,730 --> 02:12:15,730
That's some good-ass paper, though.

3175
02:12:19,640 --> 02:12:20,160
Okay.

3176
02:12:23,240 --> 02:12:25,020
Alright, I think... Wait, what?

3177
02:12:25,860 --> 02:12:26,520
Okay, here we go.

3178
02:12:26,520 --> 02:12:27,400
He's nobody important.

3179
02:12:29,320 --> 02:12:31,520
$5,000 paper.

3180
02:12:34,200 --> 02:12:34,840
Wow!

3181
02:12:35,860 --> 02:12:37,840
What the fuck?

3182
02:12:38,320 --> 02:12:40,400
What are you doing fucking meditating out here?

3183
02:12:41,580 --> 02:12:44,360
Okay, I'm gonna go back.

3184
02:12:48,370 --> 02:12:49,810
Yeah, I already did the fox.

3185
02:12:49,930 --> 02:12:51,830
I already did the fox quest.

3186
02:12:55,360 --> 02:12:56,480
Alright, is that everything?

3187
02:12:56,800 --> 02:12:58,140
Nothing left, right?

3188
02:12:58,760 --> 02:13:00,320
I'm free from the temple.

3189
02:13:01,920 --> 02:13:02,440
Right?

3190
02:13:02,440 --> 02:13:03,260
Am I free?

3191
02:13:04,720 --> 02:13:06,600
Did I grab everything I needed to grab?

3192
02:13:09,180 --> 02:13:11,060
The last captain's behind me?

3193
02:13:11,600 --> 02:13:12,540
What, that guy?

3194
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:17,100
Wait, where am I?

3195
02:13:19,740 --> 02:13:20,720
Oh, this guy.

3196
02:13:25,090 --> 02:13:25,890
Oh, down.

3197
02:13:30,080 --> 02:13:32,740
There's another monk spirit with a spade?

3198
02:13:36,600 --> 02:13:38,320
Alright, out I'll go.

3199
02:13:45,230 --> 02:13:46,750
That's too much.

3200
02:13:49,170 --> 02:13:50,550
East is right.

3201
02:13:51,870 --> 02:13:53,470
Wrong way.

3202
02:13:53,710 --> 02:13:57,530
I missed the fox lady.

3203
02:13:58,750 --> 02:14:01,550
There's so many things to do.

3204
02:14:02,810 --> 02:14:04,610
Is it this side?

3205
02:14:04,830 --> 02:14:05,890
This way?

3206
02:14:09,960 --> 02:14:11,800
This temple is huge.

3207
02:14:11,940 --> 02:14:12,400
Holy...

3208
02:14:12,400 --> 02:14:12,960
Holy shit.

3209
02:14:14,080 --> 02:14:15,500
Oh hey, there's the...

3210
02:14:15,500 --> 02:14:16,220
He has a...

3211
02:14:16,220 --> 02:14:16,760
He's blue!

3212
02:14:22,390 --> 02:14:22,910
Alright.

3213
02:14:24,490 --> 02:14:25,330
You're glowing!

3214
02:14:25,590 --> 02:14:26,570
That means you're a summon!

3215
02:14:27,990 --> 02:14:28,510
Right?

3216
02:14:28,710 --> 02:14:29,930
No, he's just like that.

3217
02:14:30,010 --> 02:14:30,390
Nevermind.

3218
02:14:30,850 --> 02:14:32,130
I don't think he's special.

3219
02:14:33,550 --> 02:14:34,070
Nevermind.

3220
02:14:34,890 --> 02:14:36,290
I don't think he's special.

3221
02:14:36,470 --> 02:14:37,010
He's just...

3222
02:14:37,010 --> 02:14:37,930
He's just like that.

3223
02:14:38,690 --> 02:14:40,150
He's just a regular guy.

3224
02:14:41,890 --> 02:14:42,410
JK.

3225
02:14:45,550 --> 02:14:47,260
I thought I saw glowing.

3226
02:14:47,510 --> 02:14:48,610
I gaslit in myself.

3227
02:14:49,350 --> 02:14:52,550
One day we'll see what chapter 3's ending looks like.

3228
02:14:52,870 --> 02:14:53,180
One...

3229
02:14:53,490 --> 02:14:56,210
I wanna figure it out one day.

3230
02:14:56,450 --> 02:14:58,610
We're here forever.

3231
02:14:59,010 --> 02:15:01,930
We're just stuck in chapter 3.

3232
02:15:02,290 --> 02:15:04,470
We never leave.

3233
02:15:06,230 --> 02:15:08,050
We're stuck in the mountains.

3234
02:15:09,850 --> 02:15:10,470
Okay.

3235
02:15:12,470 --> 02:15:13,830
Okay, I'll leave these guys.

3236
02:15:13,830 --> 02:15:15,090
They can just chill down there.

3237
02:15:15,710 --> 02:15:16,210
Like...

3238
02:15:16,210 --> 02:15:18,170
They do not need to deal with me.

3239
02:15:19,730 --> 02:15:20,390
Oh, hey!

3240
02:15:20,510 --> 02:15:21,130
Turtle God!

3241
02:15:24,130 --> 02:15:24,630
Open.

3242
02:15:26,490 --> 02:15:29,230
It's so nice of them to just let me take that for free.

3243
02:15:30,850 --> 02:15:33,710
I literally just walked over and be like...

3244
02:15:33,710 --> 02:15:34,250
Yoink!

3245
02:15:36,730 --> 02:15:38,370
Mine now, I guess.

3246
02:15:39,630 --> 02:15:41,670
Just let me walk up and just...

3247
02:15:41,670 --> 02:15:42,870
Take it, I guess.

3248
02:15:43,830 --> 02:15:47,170
I guess they didn't care as much as I thought they will.

3249
02:15:49,110 --> 02:15:51,370
Does this guy have any loot for me?

3250
02:15:53,490 --> 02:15:54,690
Just wanna make sure.

3251
02:15:58,500 --> 02:15:59,760
Turn the loot back here.

3252
02:16:00,820 --> 02:16:01,900
Are you guarding anything?

3253
02:16:02,260 --> 02:16:02,620
No.

3254
02:16:02,800 --> 02:16:03,760
Okay, you're just there.

3255
02:16:04,280 --> 02:16:05,320
Alright, I'll leave you be.

3256
02:16:05,440 --> 02:16:05,640
Bye.

3257
02:16:08,100 --> 02:16:09,600
Okay, let's just go that way.

3258
02:16:13,220 --> 02:16:14,120
Alright, here we go.

3259
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:16,400
Assist...

3260
02:16:16,400 --> 02:16:18,520
Sayak, thank you for the 20 gift of ships.

3261
02:16:18,720 --> 02:16:18,980
Thank you.

3262
02:16:19,020 --> 02:16:19,620
Thank you.

3263
02:16:19,820 --> 02:16:21,220
I really appreciate it.

3264
02:16:21,300 --> 02:16:21,620
Thank you.

3265
02:16:21,660 --> 02:16:21,820
Whoa!

3266
02:16:23,840 --> 02:16:24,880
Why are you guarding?

3267
02:16:29,820 --> 02:16:31,000
Monk from the sea?

3268
02:16:32,220 --> 02:16:33,020
Oh, shit!

3269
02:16:33,260 --> 02:16:35,360
Wait, you're different from the other tentacle monks.

3270
02:16:36,360 --> 02:16:38,860
I thought you were like the regular tentacle monks.

3271
02:16:42,540 --> 02:16:43,080
The fuck?

3272
02:16:43,080 --> 02:16:44,480
Wait, he can do that?

3273
02:16:44,620 --> 02:16:45,460
What the fuck?

3274
02:16:45,480 --> 02:16:46,220
Wait, he can do that?

3275
02:16:46,540 --> 02:16:48,060
What the fu- Okay!

3276
02:16:48,660 --> 02:16:50,280
He can do a lot apparently.

3277
02:16:52,260 --> 02:16:53,180
Oh, god.

3278
02:16:53,260 --> 02:16:53,520
Okay.

3279
02:16:53,740 --> 02:16:54,720
Go, Wukong!

3280
02:16:55,120 --> 02:16:55,580
Go!

3281
02:16:57,840 --> 02:16:58,880
Okay, that's fine.

3282
02:16:59,440 --> 02:17:00,540
That's fine, my gang.

3283
02:17:01,840 --> 02:17:03,380
My gang is coming over.

3284
02:17:03,620 --> 02:17:04,700
That's fucking right.

3285
02:17:05,820 --> 02:17:07,180
Okay, my gang's frozen.

3286
02:17:08,840 --> 02:17:09,300
Okay.

3287
02:17:10,520 --> 02:17:12,780
They're already frozen, but that's okay.

3288
02:17:12,840 --> 02:17:13,060
Okay.

3289
02:17:14,060 --> 02:17:15,420
They're gonna do something!

3290
02:17:15,820 --> 02:17:17,600
I believe in them!

3291
02:17:19,580 --> 02:17:20,420
All right.

3292
02:17:21,500 --> 02:17:22,800
They're gonna do something!

3293
02:17:26,340 --> 02:17:28,120
I believe in them!

3294
02:17:30,440 --> 02:17:31,180
That's fine.

3295
02:17:31,740 --> 02:17:32,500
We're there.

3296
02:17:34,180 --> 02:17:35,200
Oh, no.

3297
02:17:35,800 --> 02:17:37,260
No, this is not what I wanted.

3298
02:17:38,180 --> 02:17:38,740
Okay.

3299
02:17:40,800 --> 02:17:41,360
Yay!

3300
02:17:41,520 --> 02:17:42,600
Give us nothing!

3301
02:17:42,820 --> 02:17:43,040
No!

3302
02:17:45,640 --> 02:17:47,320
Oh, I forgot!

3303
02:17:47,440 --> 02:17:48,640
This is a lot of snow!

3304
02:17:49,660 --> 02:17:50,220
Oh!

3305
02:17:51,980 --> 02:17:53,060
Give me a...

3306
02:17:53,060 --> 02:17:55,060
You fucking...

3307
02:17:55,060 --> 02:17:56,400
Find me here!

3308
02:17:57,900 --> 02:17:58,460
Please!

3309
02:17:58,780 --> 02:18:00,580
Find me outside of the snow!

3310
02:18:00,740 --> 02:18:01,720
That's all I ask!

3311
02:18:03,080 --> 02:18:05,740
Stop standing in the snow, you fucker!

3312
02:18:07,740 --> 02:18:09,020
Oh, my god.

3313
02:18:09,120 --> 02:18:10,020
And I'll walk back.

3314
02:18:10,300 --> 02:18:10,840
And then...

3315
02:18:10,840 --> 02:18:13,040
You have to not touch snow one day!

3316
02:18:13,900 --> 02:18:14,840
Oh, thank god.

3317
02:18:14,920 --> 02:18:15,080
Okay.

3318
02:18:15,280 --> 02:18:15,760
Okay.

3319
02:18:16,160 --> 02:18:17,140
That's all I wanted.

3320
02:18:17,660 --> 02:18:18,140
That's...

3321
02:18:18,140 --> 02:18:19,580
That is not what I wanted, though.

3322
02:18:19,960 --> 02:18:20,440
That...

3323
02:18:20,440 --> 02:18:20,760
Okay.

3324
02:18:21,620 --> 02:18:22,600
I'll just do this.

3325
02:18:25,980 --> 02:18:26,460
Yes!

3326
02:18:26,480 --> 02:18:27,240
I'll just...

3327
02:18:40,970 --> 02:18:44,430
He just slammed down and I just died!

3328
02:18:45,610 --> 02:18:47,270
Oh, my god.

3329
02:18:47,270 --> 02:18:48,210
How the fuck...

3330
02:18:48,210 --> 02:18:50,230
I don't even remember how to get those this way.

3331
02:18:50,270 --> 02:18:50,510
Okay.

3332
02:18:50,970 --> 02:18:51,850
Oh, my god.

3333
02:18:51,850 --> 02:18:52,990
How did he do that?

3334
02:18:53,310 --> 02:18:54,750
How the fuck was that?

3335
02:18:54,770 --> 02:18:55,990
How was he able to do that?

3336
02:18:56,630 --> 02:18:58,090
That should have been illegal.

3337
02:19:00,410 --> 02:19:01,870
That should have been illegal.

3338
02:19:02,010 --> 02:19:03,730
That was a legal move right there.

3339
02:19:03,830 --> 02:19:04,510
Where was the referee?

3340
02:19:05,370 --> 02:19:07,250
Where the fuck was the referee?

3341
02:19:09,810 --> 02:19:12,370
That was an illegal move right there.

3342
02:19:12,790 --> 02:19:16,230
I need the ref right now to don't check the vons!

3343
02:19:19,450 --> 02:19:23,650
Bro, I don't even know if I'm even close to the end of chapter three.

3344
02:19:23,770 --> 02:19:24,750
I feel like I'm...

3345
02:19:24,750 --> 02:19:27,830
I feel like I'm only at 50% of chapter three right now.

3346
02:19:31,830 --> 02:19:33,990
I'm gonna ref this with the whore.

3347
02:19:39,690 --> 02:19:41,050
Holy shit.

3348
02:19:41,150 --> 02:19:42,470
This guy is crazy.

3349
02:19:43,490 --> 02:19:44,950
This guy is insane.

3350
02:19:46,970 --> 02:19:50,130
I think the worst part is just the fucking snow.

3351
02:19:50,170 --> 02:19:51,610
That's actually...

3352
02:19:51,610 --> 02:19:52,570
Did I miss?

3353
02:19:53,030 --> 02:19:53,950
Did I...

3354
02:19:53,950 --> 02:19:54,850
Did I miss?

3355
02:19:56,410 --> 02:19:57,770
No way!

3356
02:19:57,890 --> 02:19:58,430
Oh, my god.

3357
02:20:00,230 --> 02:20:02,250
There's no way.

3358
02:20:04,630 --> 02:20:08,390
I can't believe I missed big baby!

3359
02:20:08,990 --> 02:20:09,830
How?

3360
02:20:10,670 --> 02:20:13,570
How did I miss big baby?

3361
02:20:13,950 --> 02:20:16,110
He's literally all I have!

3362
02:20:18,210 --> 02:20:20,250
Oh, my god.

3363
02:20:20,390 --> 02:20:21,870
Bro, this is...

3364
02:20:21,870 --> 02:20:23,190
Bro!

3365
02:20:24,090 --> 02:20:26,980
There is he!

3366
02:20:27,160 --> 02:20:28,060
There is he!

3367
02:20:28,060 --> 02:20:30,160
Oh, my god.

3368
02:20:30,180 --> 02:20:32,940
I feel like they used so much magic!

3369
02:20:34,660 --> 02:20:36,620
Okay, just walk to...

3370
02:20:36,620 --> 02:20:38,820
No, I swear they got it.

3371
02:20:39,520 --> 02:20:40,500
Yeah, bro.

3372
02:20:40,580 --> 02:20:42,400
I swear they fucking got it.

3373
02:20:42,460 --> 02:20:44,540
Where the fuck is the non-snow?

3374
02:20:45,080 --> 02:20:45,720
Oh!

3375
02:20:47,040 --> 02:20:47,680
Okay.

3376
02:20:48,800 --> 02:20:49,440
Okay.

3377
02:20:49,580 --> 02:20:50,400
There we go.

3378
02:20:51,420 --> 02:20:54,160
No, I will never need to resist ice.

3379
02:20:55,340 --> 02:20:55,980
No.

3380
02:20:56,420 --> 02:20:57,060
Okay.

3381
02:20:57,660 --> 02:20:58,300
Okay.

3382
02:20:58,300 --> 02:20:58,800
Okay.

3383
02:20:59,520 --> 02:21:00,160
Okay.

3384
02:21:00,160 --> 02:21:02,360
In his last words.

3385
02:21:06,760 --> 02:21:07,440
No!

3386
02:21:07,780 --> 02:21:08,300
I will!

3387
02:21:10,390 --> 02:21:12,050
You can't make me!

3388
02:21:12,790 --> 02:21:13,410
No!

3389
02:21:13,410 --> 02:21:14,130
No, no, no, no.

3390
02:21:16,190 --> 02:21:16,870
Please.

3391
02:21:17,210 --> 02:21:18,930
Where are the non-snow?

3392
02:21:18,950 --> 02:21:20,310
Where's the non-snow?

3393
02:21:21,310 --> 02:21:23,090
Where's the non-snow?

3394
02:21:27,010 --> 02:21:29,470
You factual fucker.

3395
02:21:29,890 --> 02:21:31,590
Oh, my god.

3396
02:21:33,610 --> 02:21:34,830
Oh, my god.

3397
02:21:34,830 --> 02:21:34,890
Come on.

3398
02:21:34,910 --> 02:21:35,090
Okay.

3399
02:21:35,470 --> 02:21:37,250
We're not okay, though.

3400
02:21:37,310 --> 02:21:38,750
We are not okay.

3401
02:21:39,250 --> 02:21:42,630
We're absolutely not okay.

3402
02:21:48,380 --> 02:21:50,440
I got stuck!

3403
02:21:50,440 --> 02:21:51,940
We were so close!

3404
02:21:53,100 --> 02:21:56,220
Oh my god, we were so close!

3405
02:22:02,300 --> 02:22:03,260
It's okay.

3406
02:22:03,260 --> 02:22:04,720
This is it.

3407
02:22:04,780 --> 02:22:07,000
I've downloaded his entire moveset.

3408
02:22:07,540 --> 02:22:08,360
It's over.

3409
02:22:10,240 --> 02:22:13,280
I've downloaded his entire moveset in my head.

3410
02:22:13,420 --> 02:22:14,560
I figured it out.

3411
02:22:15,020 --> 02:22:16,780
I figured it out now.

3412
02:22:17,780 --> 02:22:21,040
It's so over for this fucking man.

3413
02:22:24,260 --> 02:22:24,860
No.

3414
02:22:25,960 --> 02:22:27,780
I don't need snow resistance.

3415
02:22:29,420 --> 02:22:31,440
Snow needs to resist me!

3416
02:22:33,260 --> 02:22:34,460
Alright, up I go.

3417
02:22:35,900 --> 02:22:36,720
This is it.

3418
02:22:39,540 --> 02:22:40,860
I'm beginning to believe.

3419
02:22:45,390 --> 02:22:46,430
There's no way.

3420
02:22:46,890 --> 02:22:47,950
What can he do?

3421
02:22:48,030 --> 02:22:48,550
Slap me?

3422
02:22:49,450 --> 02:22:50,750
I'll see about that.

3423
02:22:52,450 --> 02:22:53,170
I'm ready.

3424
02:22:56,370 --> 02:22:56,890
Duck!

3425
02:23:00,610 --> 02:23:01,130
Alright.

3426
02:23:02,910 --> 02:23:03,430
Boom!

3427
02:23:03,430 --> 02:23:05,130
That's right.

3428
02:23:05,490 --> 02:23:07,530
Snow resist this bitch.

3429
02:23:09,260 --> 02:23:10,310
That's fucking right.

3430
02:23:10,510 --> 02:23:12,930
Snow resist this bitch.

3431
02:23:14,330 --> 02:23:15,770
That's fucking right!

3432
02:23:16,470 --> 02:23:18,550
Can't do shit no more!

3433
02:23:20,220 --> 02:23:20,850
That's right!

3434
02:23:22,290 --> 02:23:26,750
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

3435
02:23:26,750 --> 02:23:27,070
Go!

3436
02:23:27,270 --> 02:23:27,670
Go!

3437
02:23:28,230 --> 02:23:29,010
Okay.

3438
02:23:29,370 --> 02:23:30,410
We're okay.

3439
02:23:30,630 --> 02:23:31,910
That's right, get closer.

3440
02:23:32,490 --> 02:23:33,450
Get closer.

3441
02:23:34,870 --> 02:23:36,850
Yeah, you can't do anything now, huh?

3442
02:23:36,990 --> 02:23:38,030
Yeah, that's fucking right.

3443
02:23:38,130 --> 02:23:38,970
You can't do anything now.

3444
02:23:39,070 --> 02:23:40,190
You're just gonna throw snowballs.

3445
02:23:40,490 --> 02:23:42,410
Cause you know you can't do jack shit.

3446
02:23:42,690 --> 02:23:43,850
Get closer, bitch.

3447
02:23:44,370 --> 02:23:45,050
Come on.

3448
02:23:45,690 --> 02:23:46,610
Get over here.

3449
02:23:47,490 --> 02:23:47,970
Okay.

3450
02:23:48,310 --> 02:23:49,490
You fucker.

3451
02:23:50,970 --> 02:23:51,450
Okay.

3452
02:23:55,570 --> 02:23:57,470
Alright, I see how it is.

3453
02:23:57,650 --> 02:23:59,670
I fucking see how it is.

3454
02:24:00,970 --> 02:24:01,850
I fucking...

3455
02:24:01,850 --> 02:24:03,230
Oh, my God.

3456
02:24:03,470 --> 02:24:04,930
Alright, here we go.

3457
02:24:05,110 --> 02:24:06,150
Here we go.

3458
02:24:07,030 --> 02:24:08,210
Here we go.

3459
02:24:08,990 --> 02:24:09,550
Let's go.

3460
02:24:10,470 --> 02:24:10,910
Woo!

3461
02:24:14,730 --> 02:24:15,610
Oh, shit.

3462
02:24:17,730 --> 02:24:18,410
Oh, my God.

3463
02:24:18,590 --> 02:24:19,410
No, no, no, no, no.

3464
02:24:19,410 --> 02:24:20,130
No, no, no, no, no!

3465
02:24:20,230 --> 02:24:20,770
Oh, God.

3466
02:24:21,350 --> 02:24:22,070
Oh, God.

3467
02:24:22,410 --> 02:24:23,130
Oh, God.

3468
02:24:24,670 --> 02:24:25,430
Oh, God.

3469
02:24:25,630 --> 02:24:26,470
Oh, God.

3470
02:24:26,470 --> 02:24:27,430
Oh, God.

3471
02:24:27,470 --> 02:24:28,050
Leave me alone.

3472
02:24:28,570 --> 02:24:29,350
Leave me.

3473
02:24:31,210 --> 02:24:31,650
Boom.

3474
02:24:32,270 --> 02:24:32,710
Okay.

3475
02:24:34,830 --> 02:24:36,270
Please, leave me alone.

3476
02:24:36,910 --> 02:24:37,570
Leave me a...

3477
02:24:37,570 --> 02:24:37,970
That's it.

3478
02:24:38,030 --> 02:24:38,350
That's it.

3479
02:24:38,450 --> 02:24:39,730
No more, Mr. Nice Monkey.

3480
02:24:40,010 --> 02:24:40,450
No!

3481
02:24:40,670 --> 02:24:41,590
Oh, wait, I got it.

3482
02:24:41,590 --> 02:24:42,010
I got it off.

3483
02:24:42,170 --> 02:24:43,070
I got it off.

3484
02:24:43,190 --> 02:24:43,990

3485
02:24:44,770 --> 02:24:48,870

Oh, my God.

3488
02:24:53,390 --> 02:24:54,070
Thank God.

3489
02:24:56,110 --> 02:24:56,990
I fucking...

3490
02:24:56,990 --> 02:24:57,250
Okay.

3491
02:24:58,050 --> 02:24:59,770
We will get there, monkeys.

3492
02:25:02,190 --> 02:25:03,970
Did we do it?

3493
02:25:04,110 --> 02:25:05,470
Oh, we did it!

3494
02:25:05,910 --> 02:25:08,150
Oh, we fucking did it!

3495
02:25:08,310 --> 02:25:09,250
Holy shit!

3496
02:25:09,690 --> 02:25:12,390
How is he so strong?!

3497
02:25:14,570 --> 02:25:15,290
Absorb!

3498
02:25:16,550 --> 02:25:18,750
Absorb his ass right now!

3499
02:25:22,690 --> 02:25:23,410
Whorefrost.

3500
02:25:23,410 --> 02:25:24,130
Whorefrost.

3501
02:25:24,130 --> 02:25:26,570
Idling on the- Transforming into a monk from the sea.

3502
02:25:26,710 --> 02:25:30,230
Weaving strikes with a blizzard race and launching attacks that inflict frostbane.

3503
02:25:30,490 --> 02:25:31,690
Alright, which is stronger?

3504
02:25:32,070 --> 02:25:32,970
Wolf or frost?

3505
02:25:34,970 --> 02:25:36,650
I can't believe we did it.

3506
02:25:37,590 --> 02:25:39,050
We fucking did it.

3507
02:25:39,310 --> 02:25:40,150
Am I free?

3508
02:25:40,570 --> 02:25:41,370
What are they doing?

3509
02:25:41,450 --> 02:25:42,110
Farming trees?

3510
02:25:42,270 --> 02:25:43,330
Are they minecrafting?

3511
02:25:43,950 --> 02:25:45,690
The fuck are they doing here?

3512
02:25:46,450 --> 02:25:48,390
Like, are they minecrafting right now?

3513
02:25:54,130 --> 02:25:54,910
Wolf is stronger?

3514
02:25:55,110 --> 02:25:55,810
I knew it.

3515
02:25:57,650 --> 02:26:00,490
Wolf could never fail me.

3516
02:26:00,710 --> 02:26:01,910
Are they minecrafting?

3517
02:26:04,030 --> 02:26:05,930
What are they doing over there?

3518
02:26:08,230 --> 02:26:09,510
Hello guys.

3519
02:26:14,440 --> 02:26:15,500
Where do I go?

3520
02:26:16,520 --> 02:26:17,360
Wait, it's you.

3521
02:26:21,500 --> 02:26:24,620
Don't disturb their minecraft.

3522
02:26:24,880 --> 02:26:25,980
What the fuck?

3523
02:26:28,400 --> 02:26:29,340
Am I supposed to kill you?

3524
02:26:29,540 --> 02:26:30,300
I can't tell.

3525
02:26:31,920 --> 02:26:34,680
Are you- Oh, this is not fair!

3526
02:26:34,920 --> 02:26:36,040
There's- Oh, there's the faces!

3527
02:26:38,800 --> 02:26:39,940
It's not fair!

3528
02:26:40,060 --> 02:26:41,720
He has ha- Oh, fuck this.

3529
02:26:41,780 --> 02:26:43,160
I'm not fighting this.

3530
02:26:43,520 --> 02:26:44,940
F- Okay.

3531
02:26:46,160 --> 02:26:48,940
Alright, guess that he wants to fight me.

3532
02:26:49,660 --> 02:26:50,140
Okay.

3533
02:26:51,220 --> 02:26:52,520
You can't jump here!

3534
02:26:53,340 --> 02:26:55,660
Maybe you can, but like I'm not gonna risk it.

3535
02:26:55,960 --> 02:26:56,480
Hey guys.

3536
02:26:56,960 --> 02:26:57,440
Wow!

3537
02:26:58,400 --> 02:26:59,080
Wait, where am I?

3538
02:26:59,900 --> 02:27:01,440
Wait, where am I?

3539
02:27:02,640 --> 02:27:04,040
Where the fuck did I go?

3540
02:27:04,680 --> 02:27:06,280
Like, I'm so lost!

3541
02:27:09,480 --> 02:27:11,300
Like, where did I go?

3542
02:27:11,620 --> 02:27:13,300
Okay, there's no way I can die here.

3543
02:27:13,640 --> 02:27:14,840
I'm literally 1 HP.

3544
02:27:18,900 --> 02:27:20,500
Not if I killed them first.

3545
02:27:21,440 --> 02:27:23,020
Oh no, not them.

3546
02:27:23,140 --> 02:27:23,840
Oh no.

3547
02:27:24,140 --> 02:27:26,840
Oh no, not the wolf.

3548
02:27:28,400 --> 02:27:29,720
I messed up.

3549
02:27:30,460 --> 02:27:31,980
I messed up.

3550
02:27:32,040 --> 02:27:32,620
It's okay.

3551
02:27:33,740 --> 02:27:35,040
I'm in this corner.

3552
02:27:35,200 --> 02:27:37,620
They can't find me in the corner.

3553
02:27:38,640 --> 02:27:40,880
You can't get me if I leave right now.

3554
02:27:41,420 --> 02:27:41,720
Pew!

3555
02:27:44,980 --> 02:27:46,260
No way.

3556
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:48,300
I didn't know.

3557
02:27:51,220 --> 02:27:52,960
It's just that easy.

3558
02:27:56,580 --> 02:27:56,900
Nice.

3559
02:27:58,400 --> 02:27:59,480
I missed the good loot.

3560
02:27:59,540 --> 02:28:01,680
Oh, do I have to do this again?

3561
02:28:02,980 --> 02:28:03,400
Okay.

3562
02:28:04,220 --> 02:28:06,280
Guys, I just didn't want to die to moms.

3563
02:28:06,700 --> 02:28:07,120
Okay.

3564
02:28:07,440 --> 02:28:08,060
Oh, hey.

3565
02:28:08,400 --> 02:28:09,780
I didn't see this chest.

3566
02:28:09,980 --> 02:28:10,600
What the fuck?

3567
02:28:10,600 --> 02:28:12,240
This was behind me this entire time.

3568
02:28:16,760 --> 02:28:17,180
Okay.

3569
02:28:18,320 --> 02:28:18,740
Okay.

3570
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:19,540
Don't worry.

3571
02:28:19,640 --> 02:28:20,440
We can do this again.

3572
02:28:20,800 --> 02:28:21,920
I know my way.

3573
02:28:22,240 --> 02:28:23,480
I know how to get there.

3574
02:28:23,780 --> 02:28:25,000
I needed...

3575
02:28:25,000 --> 02:28:26,740
Guys, I needed to recharge.

3576
02:28:29,260 --> 02:28:30,520
Oh, I can put the trap!

3577
02:28:30,520 --> 02:28:30,720
The trap?

3578
02:28:30,780 --> 02:28:31,320
Really?

3579
02:28:33,780 --> 02:28:34,900
Oh my god!

3580
02:28:34,920 --> 02:28:35,920
I can't!

3581
02:28:35,960 --> 02:28:37,020
Jesus Christ.

3582
02:28:37,100 --> 02:28:38,720
I could've done this the entire time.

3583
02:28:39,200 --> 02:28:40,860
Oh, I should upgrade actually.

3584
02:28:41,240 --> 02:28:42,020
Let me check.

3585
02:28:42,360 --> 02:28:43,600
What do I upgrade?

3586
02:28:44,060 --> 02:28:44,780
Uhhh...

3587
02:28:46,260 --> 02:28:46,980
Reduces...

3588
02:28:46,980 --> 02:28:48,760
I'll reduce that.

3589
02:28:49,380 --> 02:28:50,140
And then...

3590
02:28:50,140 --> 02:28:51,200
What is this?

3591
02:28:52,380 --> 02:28:53,100
Uhhh...

3592
02:28:53,100 --> 02:28:55,200
I want to do more immobilized stuff.

3593
02:28:55,640 --> 02:28:58,540
It consumes a moderate amount of...

3594
02:29:00,880 --> 02:29:01,980
To max it...

3595
02:29:01,980 --> 02:29:02,280
Mmm...

3596
02:29:02,280 --> 02:29:02,680
I don't...

3597
02:29:02,680 --> 02:29:03,500
I don't want that.

3598
02:29:03,720 --> 02:29:04,360
I don't want that.

3599
02:29:04,560 --> 02:29:04,780
Okay.

3600
02:29:04,820 --> 02:29:05,460
Cloud step.

3601
02:29:08,200 --> 02:29:08,640
Uhhh...

3602
02:29:09,160 --> 02:29:10,080
Increases the mo...

3603
02:29:11,200 --> 02:29:11,640
Increases...

3604
02:29:12,600 --> 02:29:13,440
Each talent.

3605
02:29:14,440 --> 02:29:15,800
Wait, I should actually...

3606
02:29:15,800 --> 02:29:16,720
Wait, never mind.

3607
02:29:17,800 --> 02:29:18,800
I should get that.

3608
02:29:19,500 --> 02:29:19,940
Actually...

3609
02:29:20,440 --> 02:29:21,700
I don't care about that.

3610
02:29:23,700 --> 02:29:24,140
Uhhh...

3611
02:29:24,140 --> 02:29:25,580
Buh buh buh buh buh buh buh.

3612
02:29:26,480 --> 02:29:28,360
What do I need to do here?

3613
02:29:30,840 --> 02:29:32,200
Oh, deal extra damage?

3614
02:29:32,340 --> 02:29:33,420
I like extra damage.

3615
02:29:38,180 --> 02:29:38,660
Alright.

3616
02:29:39,580 --> 02:29:40,520
We just...

3617
02:29:40,520 --> 02:29:42,360
We just need to walk all the way there.

3618
02:29:44,360 --> 02:29:45,960
We just gotta keep going.

3619
02:29:49,400 --> 02:29:49,880
Alright.

3620
02:29:50,320 --> 02:29:50,800
Alright.

3621
02:29:50,920 --> 02:29:51,640
The good loot.

3622
02:29:51,960 --> 02:29:54,380
Wherever that good loot is, we'll get there.

3623
02:29:56,000 --> 02:29:58,160
Bro, I don't even know what my skill tree is.

3624
02:29:58,240 --> 02:29:59,300
My skill tree is just...

3625
02:29:59,300 --> 02:29:59,760
It works.

3626
02:29:59,980 --> 02:30:00,460
Like...

3627
02:30:00,460 --> 02:30:00,720
Hahaha...

3628
02:30:00,720 --> 02:30:01,480
Like...

3629
02:30:01,980 --> 02:30:02,460
Hahaha...

3630
02:30:02,460 --> 02:30:02,920
Hahaha...

3631
02:30:02,940 --> 02:30:03,420
Hahaha...

3632
02:30:05,040 --> 02:30:06,560
If it works, it works.

3633
02:30:07,140 --> 02:30:07,620
Hahaha...

3634
02:30:10,180 --> 02:30:10,660
Alright.

3635
02:30:11,860 --> 02:30:14,460
Captain Illusion from the Valley of Ecstasy?

3636
02:30:15,780 --> 02:30:16,940
The fuck do I...

3637
02:30:16,940 --> 02:30:18,040
Okay, we're gonna get...

3638
02:30:18,040 --> 02:30:18,860
How do I get there?

3639
02:30:18,920 --> 02:30:19,700
The good loot shit.

3640
02:30:20,920 --> 02:30:22,520
What if I just kill these monks?

3641
02:30:23,800 --> 02:30:24,760
Fuck their meditation.

3642
02:30:28,540 --> 02:30:30,540
He doesn't know where I am because he's blind.

3643
02:30:31,420 --> 02:30:32,320
Yeah, where am I?

3644
02:30:32,940 --> 02:30:33,420
Haha!

3645
02:30:34,020 --> 02:30:34,500
Whoa!

3646
02:30:35,120 --> 02:30:37,140
He barely takes any damage?

3647
02:30:39,400 --> 02:30:40,280
That's fucking right.

3648
02:30:40,700 --> 02:30:41,440
That's right.

3649
02:30:41,820 --> 02:30:43,740
I have electricity now.

3650
02:30:43,800 --> 02:30:44,380
I don't know how.

3651
02:30:44,720 --> 02:30:47,020
I wasn't paying attention to my skill tree.

3652
02:30:47,980 --> 02:30:50,380
Oh, he has the cold iron liens.

3653
02:30:50,980 --> 02:30:51,460
Alright.

3654
02:30:53,060 --> 02:30:53,680
Let's see.

3655
02:30:53,760 --> 02:30:54,460
Alright, where do we go?

3656
02:30:55,680 --> 02:30:56,540
We go up?

3657
02:30:57,860 --> 02:30:59,240
How do we get the...

3658
02:30:59,820 --> 02:31:00,100
Good...

3659
02:31:00,100 --> 02:31:00,840
The good shit.

3660
02:31:00,900 --> 02:31:01,560
The good loot.

3661
02:31:03,580 --> 02:31:05,380
Okay, I gotta get rid of this guy though.

3662
02:31:09,900 --> 02:31:10,580
It's fine.

3663
02:31:10,660 --> 02:31:11,580
He doesn't know I'm here.

3664
02:31:12,840 --> 02:31:13,320
Alright.

3665
02:31:13,400 --> 02:31:14,460
Get rid of him though.

3666
02:31:16,920 --> 02:31:18,000
What the fuck?

3667
02:31:18,760 --> 02:31:19,820
We can do that?

3668
02:31:23,020 --> 02:31:23,500
Alright.

3669
02:31:25,080 --> 02:31:26,000
Weapon time!

3670
02:31:26,700 --> 02:31:28,160
Wherever it is!

3671
02:31:29,420 --> 02:31:31,220
Wherever the weapon is!

3672
02:31:33,540 --> 02:31:34,200
Wait... Where?

3673
02:31:36,620 --> 02:31:37,400
Is it here?

3674
02:31:38,860 --> 02:31:39,940
Where did this go?

3675
02:31:40,180 --> 02:31:41,300
It's just a random tree.

3676
02:31:43,340 --> 02:31:45,220
Guys, I'll never be not lost.

3677
02:31:45,380 --> 02:31:46,160
Like... it's just...

3678
02:31:48,280 --> 02:31:50,040
It's just life at that point.

3679
02:31:50,980 --> 02:31:51,460
Wait.

3680
02:31:51,560 --> 02:31:52,480
There's nothing here.

3681
02:31:52,580 --> 02:31:53,980
He's just chilling.

3682
02:31:55,680 --> 02:31:57,200
He's literally just chilling.

3683
02:31:58,820 --> 02:31:59,500
What the?

3684
02:31:59,520 --> 02:32:01,240
Why did you tell me to go back here?

3685
02:32:02,440 --> 02:32:02,920

3696
02:33:14,220 --> 02:33:14,700
Alright.

3697
02:33:15,240 --> 02:33:16,360
It was not him.

3698
02:33:16,580 --> 02:33:19,180
He does not give me that helmet or whatever.

3699
02:33:23,700 --> 02:33:24,180
Alright.

3700
02:33:25,480 --> 02:33:26,480

02:33:29,780 --> 02:33:30,660
Instant transmission.

3704

Alright.

3705
02:33:38,660 --> 02:33:41,140
I must have good equipment now, right?

3706
02:33:41,320 --> 02:33:44,040
I know I've bumped into some.

3707
02:33:44,660 --> 02:33:45,860
Let me double check.

3708
02:33:46,820 --> 02:33:47,420
Equipment.

3709
02:33:48,280 --> 02:33:48,880
Nope.

3710
02:33:52,560 --> 02:33:53,160
Nope.

3711
02:33:53,160 --> 02:33:54,380
All of them are garbage.

3712
02:33:55,020 --> 02:33:55,620
Nice.

3713
02:33:55,640 --> 02:33:56,440
That's good to know.

3714
02:33:59,340 --> 02:34:01,580
Alright, let's see.

3715
02:34:01,960 --> 02:34:03,140
Do I have better armor?

3716
02:34:08,160 --> 02:34:10,300
No, all my other armor is better already.

3717
02:34:10,560 --> 02:34:10,940
Okay.

3718
02:34:13,800 --> 02:34:15,160
Alright, that's good to know too.

3719
02:34:15,400 --> 02:34:16,880
Okay, Valley of Ecstasy.

3720
02:34:17,840 --> 02:34:18,720
Where is it?

3721
02:34:19,200 --> 02:34:20,180
Where do I go?

3722
02:34:20,580 --> 02:34:21,620
There's a lot of places.

3723
02:34:31,820 --> 02:34:32,740
Where do I go?

3724
02:34:35,120 --> 02:34:36,780
I'm not fighting the tiger!

3725
02:34:37,380 --> 02:34:38,740
Not today!

3726
02:34:39,560 --> 02:34:40,600
Not today.

3727
02:34:40,680 --> 02:34:42,200
I'm not fighting the tiger.

3728
02:34:43,040 --> 02:34:45,380
He's already won too many fights.

3729
02:34:45,380 --> 02:34:47,080
He caused the PC explosion.

3730
02:34:47,420 --> 02:34:49,800
I'm not fighting him today.

3731
02:34:55,270 --> 02:34:59,430
We will fight him after we finish Chapter 3.

3732
02:34:59,630 --> 02:35:02,510
I'll fight him after Chapter 3.

3733
02:35:02,650 --> 02:35:06,150
The first goal is to beat Chapter 3.

3734
02:35:08,330 --> 02:35:09,710
Okay, where do I go here?

3735
02:35:11,170 --> 02:35:12,990
Fight Tommy the Tiger.

3736
02:35:16,050 --> 02:35:16,670
Which way?

3737
02:35:17,850 --> 02:35:18,290
Woah.

3738
02:35:18,290 --> 02:35:18,730
Woah.

3739
02:35:18,890 --> 02:35:19,950
Where did you come from?

3740
02:35:22,050 --> 02:35:23,370
Oh, so it's the other side.

3741
02:35:23,510 --> 02:35:23,710
Okay.

3742
02:35:23,890 --> 02:35:24,670
It's this side.

3743
02:35:26,750 --> 02:35:27,850
Let me get rid of these.

3744
02:35:28,050 --> 02:35:28,490
Woah!

3745
02:35:28,890 --> 02:35:30,050
He was pretending!

3746
02:35:30,650 --> 02:35:32,590
But like, actually pretending!

3747
02:35:34,590 --> 02:35:35,810
Jesus Christ, come on.

3748
02:35:36,010 --> 02:35:37,270
Leave me alone, man.

3749
02:35:40,230 --> 02:35:40,670
Oh!

3750
02:35:42,070 --> 02:35:42,770
There you go.

3751
02:35:49,260 --> 02:35:49,920
It's not my dog.

3752
02:35:55,870 --> 02:35:57,210
Did you guys hear that?

3753
02:36:01,120 --> 02:36:02,460
Did you guys hear that?

3754
02:36:26,780 --> 02:36:28,140
You guys don't hear that?

3755
02:36:30,760 --> 02:36:32,540
I'm gonna check on him.

3756
02:36:32,880 --> 02:36:34,740
I'm gonna check on him.

3757
02:36:34,740 --> 02:36:35,900
What the fuck was that?

3758
02:36:37,560 --> 02:36:38,600
He's like...

3759
02:36:39,780 --> 02:36:40,520
Oh my

3760
02:38:13,950 --> 02:38:17,370
God!

3761
02:38:18,190 --> 02:38:21,650
Wait, did you guys hear that?

3762
02:38:21,650 --> 02:38:21,890
What?

3763
02:38:21,950 --> 02:38:23,770
He was like howling!

3764
02:38:24,350 --> 02:38:26,650
I've never heard that before!

3765
02:38:27,310 --> 02:38:30,850
I've never heard him howl like that before!

3766
02:38:31,830 --> 02:38:33,150
He was like...

3767
02:38:33,150 --> 02:38:33,470
Oh!

3768
02:38:34,530 --> 02:38:35,170
Oh!

3769
02:38:35,290 --> 02:38:36,330
I was like...

3770
02:38:36,330 --> 02:38:37,090
What the...

3771
02:38:37,090 --> 02:38:40,050
Like, I've never heard that specific howl!

3772
02:38:40,450 --> 02:38:40,770
Like...

3773
02:38:41,490 --> 02:38:43,710
This is the first time...

3774
02:38:43,710 --> 02:38:47,730
It was the first time I've ever heard him howl like that.

3775
02:38:47,930 --> 02:38:48,510
Woah!

3776
02:38:48,510 --> 02:38:51,010
And then, like, when I went to check on him...

3777
02:38:51,810 --> 02:38:53,210
He, like, just...

3778
02:38:53,210 --> 02:38:54,650
He fucking...

3779
02:38:54,650 --> 02:38:56,470
He fucking just jumped down.

3780
02:38:56,530 --> 02:38:57,810
Like, I couldn't even see what he was doing.

3781
02:38:58,070 --> 02:39:02,890
He literally just jumped down from his bed and just, like, met me at the door.

3782
02:39:05,670 --> 02:39:08,690
Like, he's never done that before.

3783
02:39:08,830 --> 02:39:10,490
So I was like, what the fuck?

3784
02:39:10,850 --> 02:39:11,970
Are you okay?

3785
02:39:13,110 --> 02:39:13,590
Like...

3786
02:39:15,530 --> 02:39:16,450
He's like...

3787
02:39:18,050 --> 02:39:18,550
He's like...

3788
02:39:18,550 --> 02:39:20,210
Not even when we first moved!

3789
02:39:20,890 --> 02:39:22,270
He was so...

3790
02:39:22,270 --> 02:39:25,070
Oh my god, I was just so surprised!

3791
02:39:27,850 --> 02:39:29,290
Am I at the right place?

3792
02:39:29,510 --> 02:39:29,810
Like...

3793
02:39:29,810 --> 02:39:32,530
I don't even know where I am anymore.

3794
02:39:33,010 --> 02:39:34,370
Wait, have I been here?

3795
02:39:34,430 --> 02:39:35,510
I've not been here before.

3796
02:39:35,810 --> 02:39:37,270
Where am I?

3797
02:39:39,590 --> 02:39:40,990
Oh, go back to the shrine.

3798
02:39:41,090 --> 02:39:41,370
Okay.

3799
02:39:43,590 --> 02:39:44,030
Like, what...

3800
02:39:44,030 --> 02:39:45,230
What happened?

3801
02:39:45,870 --> 02:39:47,670
Literally one day!

3802
02:39:47,930 --> 02:39:50,230
Like, what happened to him?

3803
02:39:51,390 --> 02:39:57,790
All it took was one day for him to fucking go back to his roots.

3804
02:40:01,430 --> 02:40:02,870
Wait, why is there a crow here?

3805
02:40:03,710 --> 02:40:04,910
Usually they're like...

3806
02:40:04,910 --> 02:40:07,210
Like, they never appear back after you kill them.

3807
02:40:07,270 --> 02:40:08,390
So I'm just like, what are you doing here?

3808
02:40:14,200 --> 02:40:15,280
He missed...

3809
02:40:15,280 --> 02:40:17,080
He's like, back to WoW.

3810
02:40:17,120 --> 02:40:18,540
I was not ignoring.

3811
02:40:22,670 --> 02:40:24,510
Wait, where the fuck is the...

3812
02:40:24,510 --> 02:40:26,230
I already lost track of the shrine.

3813
02:40:26,810 --> 02:40:27,410
Already...

3814
02:40:28,130 --> 02:40:29,250
Wait, no, not this.

3815
02:40:29,450 --> 02:40:29,730
No!

3816
02:40:29,910 --> 02:40:31,270
My one item!

3817
02:40:33,730 --> 02:40:34,670
It's over.

3818
02:40:35,650 --> 02:40:36,350
I used...

3819
02:40:36,350 --> 02:40:37,990
I used an item!

3820
02:40:37,990 --> 02:40:39,530
This run is dead!

3821
02:40:40,150 --> 02:40:41,950
The run is dead!

3822
02:40:47,870 --> 02:40:49,030
Is it this way?

3823
02:40:55,370 --> 02:40:56,710
Wait, so where do I go?

3824
02:40:59,550 --> 02:41:00,650
Restart the run?

3825
02:41:00,750 --> 02:41:01,610
Oh, this way.

3826
02:41:05,210 --> 02:41:07,670
We got to restart now.

3827
02:41:10,230 --> 02:41:11,810
Guys, the run is dead.

3828
02:41:15,770 --> 02:41:17,310
The run is dead.

3829
02:41:17,450 --> 02:41:18,910
Our zero item is dead.

3830
02:41:18,910 --> 02:41:20,130
Item run, it's over.

3831
02:41:20,790 --> 02:41:22,250
It's fucking over.

3832
02:41:25,870 --> 02:41:28,290
We're supposed to do no items.

3833
02:41:31,210 --> 02:41:33,170
Back to chapter one.

3834
02:41:36,450 --> 02:41:38,910
Jesus Christ, this guy took way too long.

3835
02:41:39,070 --> 02:41:39,870
Am I going the right way?

3836
02:41:40,890 --> 02:41:42,730
Oh hey, there's will though.

3837
02:41:42,850 --> 02:41:44,430
Even if I'm not, there's willpower.

3838
02:41:46,970 --> 02:41:47,510
Poke!

3839
02:41:50,030 --> 02:41:50,590
Poke!

3840
02:41:54,360 --> 02:41:54,920
Will.

3841
02:41:56,400 --> 02:41:58,280
Okay nice, that's an extra 720.

3842
02:42:01,040 --> 02:42:02,860
Okay, should be around here.

3843
02:42:03,920 --> 02:42:05,500
Alright, that's good to know.

3844
02:42:08,740 --> 02:42:10,100
Get rid of these guys.

3845
02:42:10,520 --> 02:42:12,360
I want them outta here!

3846
02:42:14,180 --> 02:42:15,780
In front of me like this?

3847
02:42:17,800 --> 02:42:19,800
Holy shit, that's a big ass bird.

3848
02:42:24,980 --> 02:42:26,020
Yoink, mine now.

3849
02:42:29,540 --> 02:42:31,060
Yoink, what the fuck is he?

3850
02:42:33,440 --> 02:42:33,940
Ow!

3851
02:42:35,500 --> 02:42:37,720
Oh, that's the guy I killed earlier!

3852
02:42:38,200 --> 02:42:39,760
Oh, that's him!

3853
02:42:40,100 --> 02:42:43,720
I was like, who the f- What the fuck is this guy?

3854
02:42:43,820 --> 02:42:44,800
Oh yeah, I killed him!

3855
02:42:45,420 --> 02:42:49,360
I just left his body to fucking rot, I guess.

3856
02:42:49,900 --> 02:42:55,140
I just left his body to fucking rot, I guess.

3857
02:42:55,140 --> 02:42:57,080
Cliff, and then I just left him to rot.

3858
02:43:00,280 --> 02:43:00,680
Alright.

3859
02:43:03,140 --> 02:43:05,660
Well, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you, Willy.

3860
02:43:06,160 --> 02:43:09,020
Did you know the green spirit regens one gourd use?

3861
02:43:09,140 --> 02:43:12,240
Blue and purple fully restores, recharges gourd.

3862
02:43:12,300 --> 02:43:13,280
Oh, I didn't know that.

3863
02:43:13,580 --> 02:43:15,620
Thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

3864
02:43:16,280 --> 02:43:16,680
Alright.

3865
02:43:18,740 --> 02:43:19,540
Time to...

3866
02:43:20,100 --> 02:43:21,400
Now I just need to...

3867
02:43:21,400 --> 02:43:22,080
Uh...

3868
02:43:22,080 --> 02:43:23,260
Go back to...

3869
02:43:23,260 --> 02:43:24,040
Oh shit, no.

3870
02:43:24,140 --> 02:43:25,560
Oh, I do need to rest too, as well.

3871
02:43:26,000 --> 02:43:26,440
Good.

3872
02:43:27,320 --> 02:43:27,760
Pagoda.

3873
02:43:28,200 --> 02:43:28,840
There we go.

3874
02:43:28,940 --> 02:43:29,320
This guy.

3875
02:43:30,260 --> 02:43:32,160
To show him that I killed all his friends.

3876
02:43:32,780 --> 02:43:34,200
All his ex-friends.

3877
02:43:36,140 --> 02:43:37,520
They're not his friends anymore.

3878
02:43:41,530 --> 02:43:42,350
Don't worry, sir.

3879
02:43:42,910 --> 02:43:44,970
All your ex-friends are dead now.

3880
02:43:46,670 --> 02:43:47,890
They didn't deserve you.

3881
02:43:50,050 --> 02:43:51,110
Wait, where is he?

3882
02:43:51,550 --> 02:43:53,210
Oh, he's like all the way back there.

3883
02:43:54,630 --> 02:43:55,750
Polly, thank you for the 10.

3884
02:43:55,830 --> 02:43:56,350
Get the shivs.

3885
02:43:56,390 --> 02:43:57,170
Thank you, thank you.

3886
02:43:59,330 --> 02:44:00,590
Alright, off we go.

3887
02:44:00,870 --> 02:44:02,330
We're off to see the wizard.

3888
02:44:02,590 --> 02:44:04,190
The wonderful wizard of Oz.

3889
02:44:06,690 --> 02:44:08,210
It's like here, right?

3890
02:44:09,410 --> 02:44:10,450
Is this where you live?

3891
02:44:10,670 --> 02:44:10,890
No.

3892
02:44:12,470 --> 02:44:13,050
Is this?

3893
02:44:13,170 --> 02:44:14,650
Oh no, that is where he lives.

3894
02:44:18,300 --> 02:44:18,700
Alright.

3895
02:44:19,500 --> 02:44:20,580
Oh shit, don't worry.

3896
02:44:20,640 --> 02:44:21,020
I got this.

3897
02:44:21,800 --> 02:44:22,380
Get out.

3898
02:44:23,300 --> 02:44:24,420
I'm already strong.

3899
02:44:24,700 --> 02:44:26,100
Thank you for bringing them back.

3900
02:44:27,140 --> 02:44:29,180
You don't have to suffer the pain of being a demon anymore.

3901
02:44:33,530 --> 02:44:35,110
I left home when I was a kid.

3902
02:44:35,690 --> 02:44:37,090
And I had to go back to heaven.

3903
02:44:39,490 --> 02:44:40,450
But now...

3904
02:44:41,230 --> 02:44:42,090
It's like this.

3905
02:44:43,350 --> 02:44:44,370
What's wrong with you?

3906
02:44:44,550 --> 02:44:45,390
You can't even get along with my brothers.

3907
02:44:46,750 --> 02:44:48,090
You just have red eyes.

3908
02:44:49,150 --> 02:44:50,050
I'm not a freak.

3909
02:44:50,390 --> 02:44:51,070
This is useless to me.

3910
02:44:51,750 --> 02:44:53,010
The cops like it.

3911
02:44:53,270 --> 02:44:53,950
Just take it.

3912
02:44:55,250 --> 02:44:56,770
What the fuck is that?

3913
02:45:03,020 --> 02:45:04,760
Thanks for the gift, emo boy.

3914
02:45:15,600 --> 02:45:18,280
I'm just monkey.

3915
02:45:22,200 --> 02:45:23,440
The third prince.

3916
02:45:23,580 --> 02:45:24,760
Oh, he's the third prince.

3917
02:45:29,880 --> 02:45:31,160
Oh, you're crazy.

3918
02:45:31,920 --> 02:45:34,320
Oh, you can't see and you're deaf.

3919
02:45:35,000 --> 02:45:39,660
Oh, maybe I should have done what you told me to do.

3920
02:45:40,220 --> 02:45:48,360
Why did I... I don't know, I didn't listen to a crazy guy.

3921
02:45:52,420 --> 02:45:54,320
Bros got all on the nerve.

3922
02:45:58,720 --> 02:46:00,160
Yeah, he said he's going home.

3923
02:46:00,220 --> 02:46:01,380
He said I'm going to go home.

3924
02:46:02,180 --> 02:46:03,060
Oh, whoops.

3925
02:46:03,180 --> 02:46:03,480
Alright.

3926
02:46:04,740 --> 02:46:10,100
I don't know if I should have done what he told me to do now that I realize he's crazy, deaf, and blind.

3927
02:46:13,800 --> 02:46:16,600
I just know he can still feel vibrations.

3928
02:46:16,940 --> 02:46:19,080
He could feel like somebody's foot there.

3929
02:46:19,860 --> 02:46:21,560
He could feel the monkey.

3930
02:46:22,260 --> 02:46:23,200
Alright, craft.

3931
02:46:24,060 --> 02:46:25,720
Can I craft this thing?

3932
02:46:26,180 --> 02:46:26,800
Ooh!

3933
02:46:27,860 --> 02:46:28,480
75.

3934
02:46:30,560 --> 02:46:31,720
Wait, that's a lot.

3935
02:46:31,840 --> 02:46:32,360
That's more.

3936
02:46:34,580 --> 02:46:35,200
Nice.

3937
02:46:35,400 --> 02:46:36,340
Ooh, wait.

3938
02:46:36,820 --> 02:46:38,980
My stick has a pointy thing now.

3939
02:46:38,980 --> 02:46:43,960
I finally learned to add a fucking sword... like a knife to my stick.

3940
02:46:44,300 --> 02:46:45,780
Alright, now where do I go?

3941
02:46:47,840 --> 02:46:51,080
Where's... now I have... I finally have a pointy stick.

3942
02:46:52,180 --> 02:46:53,360
Wait, where's the melon?

3943
02:46:55,080 --> 02:46:56,460
I got the stabby stab.

3944
02:46:56,680 --> 02:46:57,220
Stabby stab!

3945
02:46:58,800 --> 02:47:00,080
No, we gotta get the melon!

3946
02:47:09,750 --> 02:47:11,030
Forest of Felicity.

3947
02:47:12,230 --> 02:47:12,750
Okay.

3948
02:47:15,910 --> 02:47:17,490
Felicity and then run down.

3949
02:47:17,770 --> 02:47:18,350
Okay.

3950
02:47:18,970 --> 02:47:21,670
Those seems like... those seems like easy instructions.

3951
02:47:21,990 --> 02:47:22,870
How hard can it be?

3952
02:47:26,700 --> 02:47:27,560
This way.

3953
02:47:28,700 --> 02:47:29,300
Down.

3954
02:47:34,310 --> 02:47:35,130
Is this down?

3955
02:47:39,760 --> 02:47:40,500
That's up.

3956
02:47:41,200 --> 02:47:42,600
Wait, but where's...

3957
02:47:43,020 --> 02:47:43,320
Down!

3958
02:47:45,400 --> 02:47:46,500
This is down.

3959
02:47:49,000 --> 02:47:49,600
Oh!

3960
02:47:49,600 --> 02:47:51,340
I'm looking at my directions!

3961
02:47:52,040 --> 02:47:53,180
This is down.

3962
02:47:55,220 --> 02:47:56,360
Down is up!

3963
02:47:56,580 --> 02:47:57,060
Exactly!

3964
02:47:57,420 --> 02:47:58,460
Down is up!

3965
02:47:58,640 --> 02:47:59,860
Have you never heard of that before?

3966
02:48:04,360 --> 02:48:05,700
Okay, this is down.

3967
02:48:09,890 --> 02:48:10,370
Oh!

3968
02:48:11,990 --> 02:48:12,470
Whoa!

3969
02:48:12,630 --> 02:48:13,490
Okay, that's a lot.

3970
02:48:13,550 --> 02:48:14,790
That's a lot of stabby stabby.

3971
02:48:17,370 --> 02:48:17,850
Okay.

3972
02:48:18,610 --> 02:48:23,930
Oh, I like how like you can hear the different sound effects cause now there's like a knife...

3973
02:48:23,930 --> 02:48:25,030
Finally, I learned.

3974
02:48:25,170 --> 02:48:27,450
I've like mastered the Iron Age.

3975
02:48:27,790 --> 02:48:28,430
So like...

3976
02:48:29,610 --> 02:48:32,810
Monkey has mastered the Iron Age.

3977
02:48:32,950 --> 02:48:34,810
And now monkey can...

3978
02:48:34,810 --> 02:48:36,370
Can make knife.

3979
02:48:39,250 --> 02:48:40,410
I've been here before.

3980
02:48:40,470 --> 02:48:40,910
Oh, wait.

3981
02:48:41,010 --> 02:48:41,910
No, I have...

3982
02:48:41,910 --> 02:48:42,390
Wait, what?

3983
02:48:42,970 --> 02:48:44,150
Follow the water?

3984
02:48:46,690 --> 02:48:47,230
Water where?

3985
02:48:47,510 --> 02:48:48,770
Ha ha ha ha!

3986
02:48:49,730 --> 02:48:50,430
Ha ha ha ha!

3987
02:48:52,870 --> 02:48:54,890
Okay, monkey can shank now.

3988
02:48:57,070 --> 02:48:58,270
Is this water?

3989
02:49:02,700 --> 02:49:04,040
Follow the water.

3990
02:49:05,060 --> 02:49:06,060
Water follow.

3991
02:49:07,480 --> 02:49:08,940
I'm following water.

3992
02:49:10,640 --> 02:49:11,580
Monkey make knife.

3993
02:49:12,700 --> 02:49:14,320
Monkey can now stab.

3994
02:49:15,600 --> 02:49:16,080
Stabby stab!

3995
02:49:17,020 --> 02:49:18,020
Wait, who's he?

3996
02:49:18,240 --> 02:49:19,460
Oh, he's a summon!

3997
02:49:22,220 --> 02:49:22,580
Bakro!

3998
02:49:25,200 --> 02:49:26,400
That's fucking right.

3999
02:49:27,540 --> 02:49:28,260
Bakro!

4000
02:49:28,600 --> 02:49:30,220
I can stab now!

4001
02:49:30,620 --> 02:49:31,820
That's fucking right!

4002
02:49:32,960 --> 02:49:33,680
Fire!

4003
02:49:34,120 --> 02:49:34,840
Fire!

4004
02:49:35,460 --> 02:49:36,180
Fire!

4005
02:49:36,380 --> 02:49:38,340
Monkey will learn how to gun soon.

4006
02:49:38,880 --> 02:49:39,920
Ha ha ha ha!

4007
02:49:41,220 --> 02:49:43,740
If monkey can learn how to stab.

4008
02:49:44,140 --> 02:49:46,560
Monkey will learn how to fight...

4009
02:49:46,560 --> 02:49:47,600
How to gun.

4010
02:49:49,460 --> 02:49:50,440
We're almost there.

4011
02:49:53,880 --> 02:49:54,380
Absorb.

4012
02:49:58,330 --> 02:49:59,150
Alright, nice.

4013
02:49:59,270 --> 02:49:59,970
We got the...

4014
02:49:59,970 --> 02:50:01,890
We got a spirit that we'll never use.

4015
02:50:03,630 --> 02:50:06,830
Why give me fucking baby if that's like the only...

4016
02:50:06,830 --> 02:50:07,510
Ha ha ha!

4017
02:50:07,790 --> 02:50:11,090
Their first mistake is giving me the most powerful spirit.

4018
02:50:11,570 --> 02:50:13,950
Summon in the beginning of the game.

4019
02:50:14,130 --> 02:50:15,090
Ha ha ha ha!

4020
02:50:16,550 --> 02:50:18,070
That was their first mistake.

4021
02:50:18,350 --> 02:50:19,970
Now that's the only thing I use.

4022
02:50:26,450 --> 02:50:27,770
I follow water.

4023
02:50:28,890 --> 02:50:30,530
When does water end?

4024
02:50:33,150 --> 02:50:33,970
Oh, frog.

4025
02:50:34,510 --> 02:50:35,330
That's right, frog.

4026
02:50:35,790 --> 02:50:36,810
I'll beat you up.

4027
02:50:36,930 --> 02:50:37,610
Your king's dead.

4028
02:50:39,390 --> 02:50:39,950
Okay.

4029
02:50:40,750 --> 02:50:43,150
Okay, we gotta make sure this other frog is dead too.

4030
02:50:43,750 --> 02:50:44,310
Goodbye.

4031
02:50:46,090 --> 02:50:47,450
I follow water.

4032
02:50:48,310 --> 02:50:49,430
Where go now?

4033
02:50:49,830 --> 02:50:51,090
Ha ha ha ha!

4034
02:50:52,990 --> 02:50:54,310
Where monkey go?

4035
02:50:58,540 --> 02:50:59,280
Oh, hey.

4036
02:50:59,860 --> 02:51:00,900
What the fuck?

4037
02:51:00,960 --> 02:51:02,180
What the fuck is this place?

4038
02:51:04,120 --> 02:51:05,660
Well, that's a lot of absorb.

4039
02:51:08,920 --> 02:51:09,660
Oh, jump down.

4040
02:51:09,820 --> 02:51:10,160
Oh, here?

4041
02:51:12,420 --> 02:51:12,980
Okay.

4042
02:51:13,200 --> 02:51:14,680
Let's rid of him first.

4043
02:51:15,760 --> 02:51:16,320
Bye.

4044
02:51:16,900 --> 02:51:17,180
Alright.

4045
02:51:17,840 --> 02:51:18,580
Trust fall.

4046
02:51:19,740 --> 02:51:20,300
Yay!

4047
02:51:22,940 --> 02:51:23,800
Trust fall?

4048
02:51:25,480 --> 02:51:26,040
Oh.

4049
02:51:26,040 --> 02:51:26,940
Oh, we go down here.

4050
02:51:27,020 --> 02:51:27,240
Okay.

4051
02:51:27,820 --> 02:51:29,320
I was willing to fall even more.

4052
02:51:29,440 --> 02:51:30,400
I trust you guys.

4053
02:51:31,680 --> 02:51:32,140
Okay.

4054
02:51:32,140 --> 02:51:33,140
And then down here.

4055
02:51:34,200 --> 02:51:35,540
Oh, there's an incense.

4056
02:51:38,880 --> 02:51:39,340
Nice.

4057
02:51:43,740 --> 02:51:45,340
Yeah, I got a whole new move set.

4058
02:51:46,100 --> 02:51:47,480
Because I can finally shank.

4059
02:51:47,560 --> 02:51:48,360
Because monkey shank.

4060
02:51:52,810 --> 02:51:54,370
I guess into the pit.

4061
02:51:54,450 --> 02:51:55,570
This looks like a boss fight.

4062
02:51:58,110 --> 02:52:00,650
Did the melon quest tricked me into a boss fight?

4063
02:52:00,750 --> 02:52:00,870
No.

4064
02:52:00,870 --> 02:52:01,570
I was like, okay, I have to do this.

4065
02:52:01,730 --> 02:52:03,710
And then dad stops howling!

4066
02:52:09,190 --> 02:52:12,350
Why are all these fetch quests our boss fights in the end?

4067
02:52:12,610 --> 02:52:15,190
When can they actually boss fight?

4068
02:52:15,270 --> 02:52:17,450
When are they actually fetch quests?

4069
02:52:17,930 --> 02:52:18,490
Damn.

4070
02:52:18,490 --> 02:52:19,610
Look at this guy's thighs.

4071
02:52:20,470 --> 02:52:22,450
Hey, what are you?

4072
02:52:22,990 --> 02:52:26,350
I got a really bad luck, why?

4073
02:52:26,350 --> 02:52:27,070
I didn't have a chance to watch the video.

4074
02:52:27,470 --> 02:52:28,030
I swear.

4075
02:52:28,610 --> 02:52:29,330
I'm sorry.

4076
02:52:29,330 --> 02:52:29,570
I mean, I'm sorry...

4077
02:52:29,570 --> 02:52:30,850
that I had to do the theory test.

4078
02:52:30,850 --> 02:52:31,510
Wait!

4079
02:52:31,830 --> 02:52:34,570
Was he the guy that was like, I'm cold?

4080
02:52:35,290 --> 02:52:36,670
You were not cold!

4081
02:52:36,770 --> 02:52:39,750
You had the power of fire this entire time!

4082
02:52:43,010 --> 02:52:44,810
You weren't even cold!

4083
02:52:48,510 --> 02:52:51,230
You made me waste magic!

4084
02:52:55,050 --> 02:52:57,250
I can't believe it!

4085
02:52:57,450 --> 02:52:59,670
He wasn't even cold!

4086
02:53:00,850 --> 02:53:01,470
Bro!

4087
02:53:05,650 --> 02:53:06,530
That's fucked!

4088
02:53:07,050 --> 02:53:10,230
You weren't even cold in the first place!

4089
02:53:11,930 --> 02:53:13,370
That's so fucked!

4090
02:53:13,410 --> 02:53:15,130
How could you lie to me about that?

4091
02:53:16,010 --> 02:53:19,270
I swapped my magic for you, you bitch!

4092
02:53:21,650 --> 02:53:24,110
I never swapped magic!

4093
02:53:24,370 --> 02:53:27,410
I broke my magic for you!

4094
02:53:30,850 --> 02:53:32,630
You weren't even cold!

4095
02:53:32,930 --> 02:53:35,030
You're not even a man!

4096
02:53:38,610 --> 02:53:39,750
Oh my god!

4097
02:53:41,930 --> 02:53:45,050
What else have you lied to me about?

4098
02:53:47,870 --> 02:53:48,910
Oh shit!

4099
02:53:49,330 --> 02:53:50,370
Oh shit!

4100
02:53:50,610 --> 02:53:51,610
What the fuck?

4101
02:53:53,730 --> 02:53:55,130
Oh my god!

4102
02:53:55,430 --> 02:53:56,950
Stop trapping me!

4103
02:53:56,950 --> 02:53:57,330
Bro!

4104
02:54:00,010 --> 02:54:00,990
Holy shit!

4105
02:54:01,030 --> 02:54:02,330
What do I do with all these wheels?

4106
02:54:02,690 --> 02:54:04,110
What do I do?

4107
02:54:04,710 --> 02:54:06,190
There's so many wheels!

4108
02:54:06,930 --> 02:54:07,430
Wow!

4109
02:54:09,370 --> 02:54:10,510
It's all wheels!

4110
02:54:12,490 --> 02:54:13,790
Not cool, bro!

4111
02:54:13,990 --> 02:54:16,550
I thought we could be best friends, bro!

4112
02:54:17,110 --> 02:54:19,450
I thought we could be homies, bro!

4113
02:54:19,950 --> 02:54:21,150
Bro, what the fuck?

4114
02:54:21,210 --> 02:54:21,910
That's not cool!

4115
02:54:24,730 --> 02:54:25,850
It's not cool!

4116
02:54:27,550 --> 02:54:30,490
I can't believe you would trick me like that!

4117
02:54:31,830 --> 02:54:32,630
Wait, what?

4118
02:54:32,690 --> 02:54:33,430
How did I miss?

4119
02:54:34,650 --> 02:54:36,090
What the fuck?

4120
02:54:38,550 --> 02:54:39,330
Oh no.

4121
02:54:39,430 --> 02:54:40,430
Bro, not cool, bro.

4122
02:54:40,630 --> 02:54:41,410
Not cool.

4123
02:54:42,430 --> 02:54:43,510
What the fuck?

4124
02:54:46,450 --> 02:54:48,650
You literally have spinning wheels!

4125
02:54:48,910 --> 02:54:50,350
You are doing more tricks than me!

4126
02:54:52,210 --> 02:54:53,210
That's fucking right.

4127
02:54:53,310 --> 02:54:54,530
You interrupted, bitch.

4128
02:54:55,230 --> 02:54:56,630
Oh fuck, never mind.

4129
02:54:56,970 --> 02:54:58,910
He interrupted my combo too.

4130
02:54:59,330 --> 02:54:59,710
What?

4131
02:55:01,170 --> 02:55:02,170
Let me heal.

4132
02:55:02,450 --> 02:55:03,490
It's not fair.

4133
02:55:04,850 --> 02:55:06,610
What if I just do this?

4134
02:55:09,950 --> 02:55:11,510
It does nothing.

4135
02:55:12,150 --> 02:55:13,950
It's the thought that counts, you know?

4136
02:55:17,890 --> 02:55:18,750
Doesn't matter.

4137
02:55:19,270 --> 02:55:20,450
That's fucking right!

4138
02:55:21,910 --> 02:55:22,830
A quirky man.

4139
02:55:23,450 --> 02:55:25,150
I like how that's his description.

4140
02:55:32,610 --> 02:55:33,230
Your brother?

4141
02:55:34,450 --> 02:55:36,850
Your brother called for my hit?

4142
02:55:42,280 --> 02:55:43,720
Thank god I got the shank.

4143
02:55:43,900 --> 02:55:45,820
I think I wouldn't have been able to do it, but...

4144
02:55:45,820 --> 02:55:45,880
Oh!

4145
02:55:46,100 --> 02:55:47,560
I brought back the grass!

4146
02:55:54,690 --> 02:55:55,730
I did it.

4147
02:55:56,530 --> 02:55:58,150
Grass shall return now.

4148
02:55:59,610 --> 02:56:01,370
He played with portals.

4149
02:56:01,390 --> 02:56:01,850
Wait!

4150
02:56:02,110 --> 02:56:03,250
There's melons!

4151
02:56:05,290 --> 02:56:07,070
There is melons!

4152
02:56:07,070 --> 02:56:07,850
He did it!

4153
02:56:08,470 --> 02:56:10,190
Does that mean there's no more snow?

4154
02:56:20,240 --> 02:56:27,700
Oh my god,

4155
02:56:32,730 --> 02:56:33,330
it's your melons!

4156
02:56:33,330 --> 02:56:33,550
Melons!

4157
02:56:37,510 --> 02:56:38,630
The fuck?

4158
02:56:42,890 --> 02:56:44,430
That's a strong ass baby.

4159
02:56:46,450 --> 02:56:48,550
That's a fucking strong ass baby!

4160
02:56:49,550 --> 02:56:50,270
Yeah!

4161
02:56:57,880 --> 02:56:58,600
Oh?

4162
02:57:04,900 --> 02:57:05,500
What trick?

4163
02:57:10,390 --> 02:57:13,030
Of course I'm not going to trust this random baby.

4164
02:57:20,910 --> 02:57:21,590
Oh?

4165
02:57:28,860 --> 02:57:30,040
What did he do?

4166
02:57:34,280 --> 02:57:38,540
Find spells, vessels, transformation, and soul skills.

4167
02:57:39,040 --> 02:57:42,020
To enhance attack focusing solely on martial arts.

4168
02:57:42,720 --> 02:57:44,200
What spell is that?

4169
02:57:44,960 --> 02:57:45,840
Where does it go?

4170
02:57:51,780 --> 02:57:53,840
He gave me baby queens.

4171
02:57:56,620 --> 02:57:58,200
Yeah, but what does it replace?

4172
02:58:04,820 --> 02:58:06,000
The Great Pagoda?

4173
02:58:16,360 --> 02:58:18,340
Oh, it takes my transformations?

4174
02:58:30,100 --> 02:58:33,240
It locks your spell to go full melee.

4175
02:58:34,500 --> 02:58:34,980
Okay.

4176
02:58:35,960 --> 02:58:36,440
Okay.

4177
02:58:39,980 --> 02:58:41,840
You can't, but you hit so much.

4178
02:58:41,960 --> 02:58:43,060
All right, we'll try it out.

4179
02:58:43,120 --> 02:58:44,180
I guess we could try it out.

4180
02:58:45,920 --> 02:58:46,660
All right.

4181
02:58:47,100 --> 02:58:48,620
We have to go to the Great Pagoda?

4182
02:58:48,940 --> 02:58:50,140
Where the fuck is that?

4183
02:58:54,990 --> 02:58:56,950
How do we get to the Great Pagoda?

4184
02:58:58,270 --> 02:58:59,410
Bunga bunga.

4185
02:58:59,490 --> 02:59:00,310
All right, let's see.

4186
02:59:00,870 --> 02:59:01,450
Spells.

4187
02:59:01,450 --> 02:59:02,330
Set spells.

4188
02:59:02,630 --> 02:59:03,530
I guess it's this?

4189
02:59:05,370 --> 02:59:05,950
No?

4190
02:59:09,600 --> 02:59:10,180
Oh!

4191
02:59:11,560 --> 02:59:12,140
Okay.

4192
02:59:13,280 --> 02:59:16,740
By slapping rain on a palm, it constrains senses when active.

4193
02:59:17,380 --> 02:59:19,700
Binding the use of any and solo when comfortable.

4194
02:59:20,620 --> 02:59:24,050
Cable cap restricting this spell may offer an unexpected effect.

4195
02:59:29,990 --> 02:59:33,110
Oh, you go down to find all the secret areas.

4196
02:59:33,210 --> 02:59:35,390
Wait, what are all the secret areas?

4197
02:59:43,820 --> 02:59:44,580
Let's see.

4198
02:59:46,140 --> 02:59:47,660
Does it use all of it?

4199
02:59:48,240 --> 02:59:50,740
Can I like... wait, let me check it.

4200
02:59:50,980 --> 02:59:52,000
How much does it cost?

4201
02:59:52,980 --> 02:59:53,500
310.

4202
02:59:54,680 --> 02:59:56,720
That's all my spell points, right?

4203
03:00:00,850 --> 03:00:03,570
Oh, so I have to do four and five.

4204
03:00:03,970 --> 03:00:07,230
Okay, I have to do chapter four and five before I can go back to the Great Pagoda.

4205
03:00:07,390 --> 03:00:07,630
Okay.

4206
03:00:08,470 --> 03:00:10,470
Okay, how do I get to the final boss?

4207
03:00:11,770 --> 03:00:12,790
Where's the final boss?

4208
03:00:12,930 --> 03:00:13,890
Also, unlock this.

4209
03:00:14,090 --> 03:00:15,090
And I don't know what to do.

4210
03:00:15,730 --> 03:00:16,290
Wait, no.

4211
03:00:16,610 --> 03:00:18,250
Oh, and yeah, that's the Great Pagoda.

4212
03:00:18,490 --> 03:00:19,130
Unlock this.

4213
03:00:20,470 --> 03:00:21,610
I found this.

4214
03:00:22,050 --> 03:00:22,930
There it is.

4215
03:00:29,050 --> 03:00:30,090
Back to the temple.

4216
03:00:30,230 --> 03:00:30,550
Okay.

4217
03:00:38,260 --> 03:00:39,720
Straight all the way.

4218
03:00:39,780 --> 03:00:40,160
Okay.

4219
03:00:41,360 --> 03:00:42,200
All the way.

4220
03:00:42,280 --> 03:00:44,540
Is there like an incense area for it?

4221
03:00:44,660 --> 03:00:45,420
Oh my god, guys.

4222
03:00:45,720 --> 03:00:51,900
Guys, I can't believe we're gonna see what the final... what the end of chapter three is gonna be.

4223
03:00:54,180 --> 03:00:55,780
Oh my god, guys.

4224
03:00:55,840 --> 03:00:58,600
We're actually... holy shit.

4225
03:00:58,940 --> 03:01:00,540
It's been three hours.

4226
03:01:00,600 --> 03:01:03,100
We're gonna see the end of chapter three.

4227
03:01:03,140 --> 03:01:04,200
That's actually crazy.

4228
03:01:04,400 --> 03:01:05,000
Oh my god, guys.

4229
03:01:05,000 --> 03:01:05,000
We're actually...

4230
03:01:05,000 --> 03:01:05,000
holy shit.

4231
03:01:05,000 --> 03:01:05,000
It's been three hours.

4232
03:01:05,000 --> 03:01:05,000
We're gonna see the end of chapter three.

4233
03:01:05,000 --> 03:01:05,000
That's actually crazy.

4234
03:01:05,020 --> 03:01:06,060
Oh my god.

4235
03:01:09,380 --> 03:01:11,380
It's been twenty years.

4236
03:01:13,660 --> 03:01:15,960
We're gonna leave Snowland.

4237
03:01:16,300 --> 03:01:19,040
I heard chapter three is literally like the...

4238
03:01:19,040 --> 03:01:20,960
Oh my god.

4239
03:01:21,040 --> 03:01:23,960
It's like the heart... the longest chapter out of everything.

4240
03:01:24,360 --> 03:01:27,840
So like chapter four and five, six will not be as long.

4241
03:01:32,000 --> 03:01:33,920
It took me so long.

4242
03:01:33,920 --> 03:01:35,380
But we're getting there.

4243
03:01:38,460 --> 03:01:40,780
Is chapter five longer?

4244
03:01:41,620 --> 03:01:44,080
Wait, chapter four is even longer?

4245
03:01:45,300 --> 03:01:46,820
Was I lied to?

4246
03:01:46,920 --> 03:01:48,680
I thought three was the longest.

4247
03:01:49,180 --> 03:01:50,080
Wait, what?

4248
03:01:50,620 --> 03:01:51,600
I literally...

4249
03:01:51,600 --> 03:01:54,980
Literally you guys told me chapter three was the longest.

4250
03:01:55,780 --> 03:01:56,440
No!

4251
03:02:01,560 --> 03:02:02,880
Oh no.

4252
03:02:03,040 --> 03:02:05,280
Wait, why is there two big babies?

4253
03:02:06,220 --> 03:02:07,980
Why is there two of you?

4254
03:02:08,840 --> 03:02:10,080
Wait a minute.

4255
03:02:13,910 --> 03:02:14,430
Wait.

4256
03:02:15,110 --> 03:02:16,930
Should I be fighting you guys?

4257
03:02:18,670 --> 03:02:19,790
Alright, I'm not.

4258
03:02:19,850 --> 03:02:20,890
I'm gonna ignore you guys.

4259
03:02:21,070 --> 03:02:21,710
No, I'm gonna...

4260
03:02:22,230 --> 03:02:22,550
Okay.

4261
03:02:23,150 --> 03:02:25,870
I guess he doesn't want me to ignore you guys.

4262
03:02:26,430 --> 03:02:28,110
But you can't stop me.

4263
03:02:28,170 --> 03:02:28,830
I can't...

4264
03:02:28,830 --> 03:02:29,950
I can't read.

4265
03:02:30,850 --> 03:02:31,930
That's fucking right.

4266
03:02:32,010 --> 03:02:32,830
What you gonna do?

4267
03:02:33,410 --> 03:02:34,450
Can't walk up...

4268
03:02:34,450 --> 03:02:34,670
Oh.

4269
03:02:36,890 --> 03:02:38,570
That's a dead end.

4270
03:02:39,370 --> 03:02:39,970
Guys.

4271
03:02:40,630 --> 03:02:41,230
Guys.

4272
03:02:41,890 --> 03:02:44,310
He can't walk up the stairs.

4273
03:02:44,330 --> 03:02:44,910
Guys.

4274
03:02:45,310 --> 03:02:50,350
He can't walk up the stairs, guys.

4275
03:02:50,350 --> 03:02:50,490
He can't...

4276
03:02:51,490 --> 03:02:54,090
Oh, there was a stripe behind me.

4277
03:02:54,410 --> 03:02:56,290
I didn't even notice.

4278
03:02:58,490 --> 03:03:01,210
I guess I have to walk through that again.

4279
03:03:07,910 --> 03:03:09,250
Oh, baby.

4280
03:03:09,430 --> 03:03:09,790
Baby.

4281
03:03:09,790 --> 03:03:09,890
Baby.

4282
03:03:09,890 --> 03:03:09,970
Baby.

4283
03:03:09,970 --> 03:03:10,050
Baby.

4284
03:03:14,010 --> 03:03:15,890
Are you evil, baby?

4285
03:03:16,890 --> 03:03:19,450
I thought you were the Buddha.

4286
03:03:43,630 --> 03:03:45,810
Wait, that's a different baby?

4287
03:03:47,070 --> 03:03:50,130
How many babies are in the world?

4288
03:04:03,330 --> 03:04:05,670
Yellow baby equals evil baby?

4289
03:04:18,570 --> 03:04:20,590
Oh, you sound like an evil baby.

4290
03:04:21,490 --> 03:04:23,390
You sound like a very angry...

4291
03:04:23,390 --> 03:04:24,810
Somebody's past your bedtime.

4292
03:04:25,810 --> 03:04:27,490
Baby, are you past your bedtime?

4293
03:04:33,330 --> 03:04:34,630
He was not baby.

4294
03:04:37,110 --> 03:04:38,890
Oh, you're not a baby.

4295
03:04:39,070 --> 03:04:39,590
Oh!

4296
03:04:40,450 --> 03:04:40,870
Oh!

4297
03:04:42,970 --> 03:04:45,510
You are definitely not a baby.

4298
03:04:47,690 --> 03:04:48,530
Oh, shit!

4299
03:04:50,690 --> 03:04:51,650
Oh, my God.

4300
03:04:52,890 --> 03:04:53,310
Okay.

4301
03:04:56,970 --> 03:04:59,190
Okay, now I know what that is.

4302
03:05:00,770 --> 03:05:01,850
There we go, we got it.

4303
03:05:05,410 --> 03:05:05,830
Okay.

4304
03:05:06,550 --> 03:05:08,350
Alright, I have to figure out what your moves are.

4305
03:05:09,510 --> 03:05:11,350
I need to figure out what your moves are.

4306
03:05:11,510 --> 03:05:12,170
I'm so confused.

4307
03:05:15,190 --> 03:05:15,930
Oh, shit!

4308
03:05:19,950 --> 03:05:21,430
Oh, what?

4309
03:05:21,650 --> 03:05:23,390
Okay, he disappeared anyway.

4310
03:05:25,630 --> 03:05:28,650
What is he doing?

4311
03:05:30,530 --> 03:05:31,330
Yes!

4312
03:05:32,870 --> 03:05:34,250
Interrupts your moment.

4313
03:05:36,390 --> 03:05:37,710
I didn't know what he was doing.

4314
03:05:38,810 --> 03:05:40,610
I'm just as confused.

4315
03:05:44,750 --> 03:05:46,430
I didn't know he was monologuing.

4316
03:05:46,550 --> 03:05:47,850
I was like, what is he doing?

4317
03:05:49,170 --> 03:05:50,010
So rude.

4318
03:05:50,790 --> 03:05:52,710
What the fuck was I supposed to do?

4319
03:05:58,750 --> 03:06:00,130
I'm just trying to fight.

4320
03:06:03,810 --> 03:06:04,750
What the fuck?

4321
03:06:06,890 --> 03:06:07,790
What is he doing?

4322
03:06:09,530 --> 03:06:10,470
What is he doing?

4323
03:06:10,470 --> 03:06:11,270
What is he doing?

4324
03:06:11,270 --> 03:06:12,070
What is that?

4325
03:06:14,030 --> 03:06:15,850
What the fuck is that?

4326
03:06:17,790 --> 03:06:18,690
What did he do?

4327
03:06:22,110 --> 03:06:23,410
What was that?

4328
03:06:23,850 --> 03:06:26,490
Is that their creation?

4329
03:06:30,430 --> 03:06:30,950
Okay.

4330
03:06:31,190 --> 03:06:31,370
Okay.

4331
03:06:31,370 --> 03:06:31,670
Okay, now I know.

4332
03:06:31,770 --> 03:06:32,970
Okay, now I know.

4333
03:06:33,610 --> 03:06:34,550
Now I know.

4334
03:06:35,550 --> 03:06:36,470
Now I know.

4335
03:06:41,010 --> 03:06:41,930
Oh, shit!

4336
03:06:41,970 --> 03:06:42,290
Oh, shit!

4337
03:06:42,290 --> 03:06:43,630
THAT STILL HITS ME?!

4338
03:06:47,470 --> 03:06:49,310
Oh my god, okay.

4339
03:06:50,770 --> 03:06:51,950
Oh no.

4340
03:06:56,770 --> 03:06:57,610
Okay.

4341
03:06:57,830 --> 03:06:58,290
No!

4342
03:07:08,300 --> 03:07:14,270
I'm so confused!

4343
03:07:15,910 --> 03:07:19,570
Oh my god, his movesets are so confusing!

4344
03:07:22,190 --> 03:07:23,190
Baby smash!

4345
03:07:24,050 --> 03:07:25,230
I'm panicked!

4346
03:07:26,890 --> 03:07:27,390
NOOOOOO!

4347
03:07:30,070 --> 03:07:32,950
Oh my god, I was so confused!

4348
03:07:33,490 --> 03:07:35,930
I was like, what is he- oh no, the water's all the way back!

4349
03:07:36,370 --> 03:07:37,830
Oh my god!

4350
03:07:38,710 --> 03:07:42,170
I was- what- oh my god, I could've first tried him too!

4351
03:07:43,790 --> 03:07:47,330
I could've first tried him if I wasn't so confused!

4352
03:07:56,130 --> 03:07:57,250
Oh my god!

4353
03:07:57,250 --> 03:08:00,950
He was so- oh my god, it literally was so easy!

4354
03:08:03,270 --> 03:08:06,370
Literally, I could've just fucking instantly killed him.

4355
03:08:08,430 --> 03:08:09,730
Okay, I can do this.

4356
03:08:14,450 --> 03:08:15,010
Okay.

4357
03:08:15,010 --> 03:08:15,250
Alright.

4358
03:08:16,170 --> 03:08:17,650
Yeah, he's so easy!

4359
03:08:17,890 --> 03:08:19,310
He was actually so easy!

4360
03:08:19,350 --> 03:08:20,310
I was just confused!

4361
03:08:24,430 --> 03:08:24,910
Alright.

4362
03:08:25,010 --> 03:08:29,470
I was just confused with his moveset because sometimes he- WHAT THE FUCK?!

4363
03:08:29,470 --> 03:08:29,910
Okay.

4364
03:08:30,210 --> 03:08:33,230
But sometimes I didn't do anything because I was like, what do I do?

4365
03:08:33,410 --> 03:08:34,470
Like, what is he doing?

4366
03:08:38,730 --> 03:08:39,210
Alright.

4367
03:08:40,230 --> 03:08:41,230
Up we go.

4368
03:08:42,910 --> 03:08:43,930
Up we go.

4369
03:08:44,670 --> 03:08:46,090
We're gonna get to the shrine.

4370
03:08:48,850 --> 03:08:50,180
Yeah, he's so sluggish.

4371
03:08:50,590 --> 03:08:52,130
His timing was so weird.

4372
03:08:52,770 --> 03:08:55,030
I didn't understand the timing too.

4373
03:08:55,350 --> 03:08:56,770
I didn't understand the timing too.

4374
03:08:57,650 --> 03:08:58,990
Okay, where's the shrine?

4375
03:09:01,970 --> 03:09:03,830
Should be here somewhere, right?

4376
03:09:06,470 --> 03:09:07,490
Where is it?

4377
03:09:09,290 --> 03:09:10,910
Oh, there it is!

4378
03:09:11,810 --> 03:09:13,590
Oh my god, it was so far away.

4379
03:09:13,830 --> 03:09:14,810
Oh my god, it was so far away.

4380
03:09:15,870 --> 03:09:16,590
I'm blind.

4381
03:09:16,770 --> 03:09:17,690
Look, it's white!

4382
03:09:17,910 --> 03:09:18,610
On white!

4383
03:09:18,930 --> 03:09:20,070
It's snow on snow!

4384
03:09:20,150 --> 03:09:21,870
How the fuck was I supposed to know?

4385
03:09:22,650 --> 03:09:24,330
It's snow on snow!

4386
03:09:26,250 --> 03:09:26,770
It's snow on snow!

4387
03:09:26,770 --> 03:09:28,070
Oh hey, there's a will here.

4388
03:09:28,750 --> 03:09:29,450
I'm sorry.

4389
03:09:32,150 --> 03:09:33,790
Oh my god, 1200?

4390
03:09:34,610 --> 03:09:35,210
That's a lot.

4391
03:09:35,870 --> 03:09:37,130
That's actually a lot.

4392
03:09:38,750 --> 03:09:39,270
Alright.

4393
03:09:45,450 --> 03:09:46,250
Oh, okay.

4394
03:09:50,150 --> 03:09:51,290
Alright, here we go again.

4395
03:09:51,930 --> 03:09:53,190
I like how he's just chilling.

4396
03:09:55,390 --> 03:09:56,490
Like how he's just...

4397
03:09:57,630 --> 03:09:59,070
He's just watching me.

4398
03:10:02,870 --> 03:10:03,730
He's just like, hey.

4399
03:10:04,830 --> 03:10:05,670
I'm like, hey.

4400
03:10:08,010 --> 03:10:08,870
Hey to you too.

4401
03:10:14,380 --> 03:10:15,700
Okay, now I know what that...

4402
03:10:16,880 --> 03:10:17,280
Whoa!

4403
03:10:18,420 --> 03:10:19,320
Okay, recharge.

4404
03:10:19,540 --> 03:10:20,020
Recharge.

4405
03:10:21,380 --> 03:10:21,860
Oh!

4406
03:10:23,220 --> 03:10:23,700
Whoa!

4407
03:10:24,920 --> 03:10:26,360
Oh, big baby tripped.

4408
03:10:26,480 --> 03:10:27,760
Big baby tripped!

4409
03:10:27,780 --> 03:10:28,660
That's fucking right!

4410
03:10:29,060 --> 03:10:29,920
Get tripped!

4411
03:10:31,680 --> 03:10:32,520
Get tripped!

4412
03:10:33,840 --> 03:10:34,320
Okay.

4413
03:10:34,820 --> 03:10:36,200
This is the hard part.

4414
03:10:36,280 --> 03:10:37,800
When he does all of that shit.

4415
03:10:38,820 --> 03:10:39,300
Like...

4416
03:10:42,740 --> 03:10:43,220
Oh!

4417
03:10:43,300 --> 03:10:44,600
Okay, I can only get one hit in.

4418
03:10:44,640 --> 03:10:44,860
Okay.

4419
03:10:48,580 --> 03:10:49,340
Like, I don't...

4420
03:10:49,340 --> 03:10:51,000
I don't know what... I don't know what this is.

4421
03:10:51,400 --> 03:10:51,840
Like...

4422
03:10:52,580 --> 03:10:53,020
Okay.

4423
03:10:57,520 --> 03:10:57,960
Okay.

4424
03:10:58,540 --> 03:10:59,560
What is he doing?

4425
03:10:59,700 --> 03:11:00,000
Okay.

4426
03:11:00,740 --> 03:11:01,540
He does that?

4427
03:11:01,740 --> 03:11:02,060
Okay.

4428
03:11:02,180 --> 03:11:03,140
What does... What is that?

4429
03:11:06,580 --> 03:11:07,020
Okay.

4430
03:11:07,020 --> 03:11:07,460
Alright.

4431
03:11:10,100 --> 03:11:10,540
Oh!

4432
03:11:11,380 --> 03:11:12,400
I ran out of stamina.

4433
03:11:12,640 --> 03:11:13,740
I ran out of stamina!

4434
03:11:14,120 --> 03:11:14,480
No!

4435
03:11:19,860 --> 03:11:21,440
I ran out of stamina.

4436
03:11:21,740 --> 03:11:23,280
I ran out of stamina!

4437
03:11:24,460 --> 03:11:29,110
I ran out of stamina!

4438
03:11:29,110 --> 03:11:29,670
I greeted!

4439
03:11:30,430 --> 03:11:31,910
I ran out of stamina!

4440
03:11:31,910 --> 03:11:33,070
I couldn't dodge!

4441
03:11:34,130 --> 03:11:36,170
Oh my god!

4442
03:11:37,030 --> 03:11:38,470
I couldn't...

4443
03:11:38,470 --> 03:11:39,590
I got greedy!

4444
03:11:40,150 --> 03:11:44,250
I got greedy and I couldn't dodge because I ran out of stamina.

4445
03:11:46,030 --> 03:11:46,750
No!

4446
03:11:46,750 --> 03:11:47,630
NOOOOOO!

4447
03:11:47,630 --> 03:11:50,530
That would have been so easy too!

4448
03:11:56,670 --> 03:11:57,470
Okay.

4449
03:11:58,230 --> 03:12:00,170
Oh shit, not okay.

4450
03:12:01,910 --> 03:12:03,930
Guys, it was not okay, guys.

4451
03:12:04,150 --> 03:12:07,430
I fucked up.

4452
03:12:07,610 --> 03:12:09,450
It was definitely not okay.

4453
03:12:10,790 --> 03:12:11,350
Okay.

4454
03:12:13,850 --> 03:12:14,910
Fuck you.

4455
03:12:15,210 --> 03:12:16,730
Actually, fuck you.

4456
03:12:17,530 --> 03:12:18,090
Sam!

4457
03:12:19,090 --> 03:12:20,450
Oh, that still hits me?

4458
03:12:21,550 --> 03:12:22,110
NOOOOO!

4459
03:12:22,110 --> 03:12:22,810
That still...

4460
03:12:24,250 --> 03:12:26,150
That's a grab?!

4461
03:12:26,150 --> 03:12:27,550
Let go of me!

4462
03:12:27,650 --> 03:12:28,230
Let me go!

4463
03:12:28,290 --> 03:12:28,810
Let me go!

4464
03:12:40,110 --> 03:12:42,010
I can't grapple.

4465
03:12:44,590 --> 03:12:46,690
If I didn't get stunned!

4466
03:12:46,950 --> 03:12:51,770
If I didn't lose my stamina on the second run, it would have been so easy.

4467
03:12:53,010 --> 03:12:55,030
Cookie, I got grappled.

4468
03:12:55,770 --> 03:12:57,210
I must have some!

4469
03:12:57,390 --> 03:12:57,950
Oh, I do.

4470
03:12:58,090 --> 03:12:58,850
Thank god.

4471
03:12:58,990 --> 03:12:59,550
I was gonna say.

4472
03:12:59,770 --> 03:13:01,550
I must have some.

4473
03:13:03,450 --> 03:13:04,410
Removes all four.

4474
03:13:04,470 --> 03:13:06,470
Recovers a concern after successfully performing.

4475
03:13:06,750 --> 03:13:07,250
Okay.

4476
03:13:07,970 --> 03:13:09,250
Okay, we'll do that.

4477
03:13:11,990 --> 03:13:12,550
Oh...

4478
03:13:13,610 --> 03:13:15,990
Oh my god, I got grappled.

4479
03:13:16,050 --> 03:13:16,910
I got karma'd.

4480
03:13:18,170 --> 03:13:19,610
I got grappled.

4481
03:13:22,250 --> 03:13:24,130
Stupid man-baby.

4482
03:13:25,550 --> 03:13:27,590
Stupid man-baby.

4483
03:13:30,650 --> 03:13:31,310
Jesus.

4484
03:13:33,830 --> 03:13:35,410
Stupid fucking man-baby.

4485
03:13:35,570 --> 03:13:37,130
Stupid fucking man-baby.

4486
03:13:38,530 --> 03:13:41,130
Oh my god, are you fucking kidding me?

4487
03:13:42,970 --> 03:13:44,810
I'm gonna stab you.

4488
03:13:45,010 --> 03:13:46,330
Stupid fucking man-baby.

4489
03:13:46,470 --> 03:13:47,010
That's fucking right.

4490
03:13:47,010 --> 03:13:47,890
I'm gonna stab you.

4491
03:13:49,190 --> 03:13:49,710
NOOOOO!

4492
03:13:50,450 --> 03:13:52,030
Okay, I know what that does now.

4493
03:13:54,150 --> 03:13:54,670
Poke!

4494
03:13:56,690 --> 03:13:58,150
That's fucking right, man-baby.

4495
03:13:58,510 --> 03:13:59,870
Get your ass poked.

4496
03:14:00,270 --> 03:14:01,730
Get your ass poked!

4497
03:14:02,630 --> 03:14:03,150
Poke!

4498
03:14:04,570 --> 03:14:06,010
And I'll keep doing it too.

4499
03:14:06,490 --> 03:14:07,010
Poke!

4500
03:14:08,510 --> 03:14:09,010
Okay.

4501
03:14:09,290 --> 03:14:11,290
Alright, stamina, stamina, stamina.

4502
03:14:12,550 --> 03:14:13,530
Oh, okay, goodbye.

4503
03:14:14,630 --> 03:14:16,210
Where did he TP to?

4504
03:14:18,430 --> 03:14:20,790
Oh, I still don't know what that does.

4505
03:14:23,370 --> 03:14:24,930
I'm just gonna do this for you.

4506
03:14:24,990 --> 03:14:26,810
And then... do that?

4507
03:14:27,330 --> 03:14:29,050
I don't know.

4508
03:14:31,590 --> 03:14:32,190
Okay.

4509
03:14:33,350 --> 03:14:34,530
I know now.

4510
03:14:34,930 --> 03:14:36,970
I know now.

4511
03:14:36,970 --> 03:14:37,210
Now.

4512
03:14:39,850 --> 03:14:40,470
Okay.

4513
03:14:40,670 --> 03:14:42,230
I figured it out.

4514
03:14:46,590 --> 03:14:49,630
Okay, you do that.

4515
03:14:49,970 --> 03:14:51,650
I found out.

4516
03:14:54,770 --> 03:14:56,170
Oh shit!

4517
03:14:57,830 --> 03:15:00,890
I fucked around- WHAT?!

4518
03:15:02,850 --> 03:15:04,470
Oh my god.

4519
03:15:08,150 --> 03:15:08,850
Okay...

4520
03:15:11,210 --> 03:15:12,610
Okay...

4521
03:15:12,610 --> 03:15:13,530
Okay...

4522
03:15:13,530 --> 03:15:15,230
I found out...

4523
03:15:16,010 --> 03:15:18,170
I found out...

4524
03:15:21,840 --> 03:15:23,640
Max out spellbinding?

4525
03:15:24,740 --> 03:15:25,440
Okay...

4526
03:15:25,440 --> 03:15:27,300
Alright, but doesn't it re- Does...

4527
03:15:27,840 --> 03:15:28,820
Reignite?

4528
03:15:30,820 --> 03:15:31,960
No, okay.

4529
03:15:33,340 --> 03:15:34,740
Uhhhh...

4530
03:15:35,820 --> 03:15:37,220
I guess...

4531
03:15:37,220 --> 03:15:37,960
Wait...

4532
03:15:41,100 --> 03:15:42,420
I guess I get rid of this?

4533
03:15:44,820 --> 03:15:47,880
Guys, I don't remember what I got, so this is gonna be fun.

4534
03:15:48,220 --> 03:15:50,620
This is gonna be fun.

4535
03:15:53,320 --> 03:15:54,840
Okay, let's figure this out.

4536
03:15:57,160 --> 03:15:57,600
Okay.

4537
03:15:58,300 --> 03:16:00,580
And then, we'll put it all on this.

4538
03:16:07,260 --> 03:16:07,700
Okay.

4539
03:16:08,640 --> 03:16:09,080
Nice.

4540
03:16:09,080 --> 03:16:12,680
Okay, I don't know what I did, so this is gonna be very fun.

4541
03:16:17,340 --> 03:16:19,380
This is gonna be so fun.

4542
03:16:22,400 --> 03:16:23,540
Alright, nice.

4543
03:16:29,690 --> 03:16:31,710
No think, only bonk.

4544
03:16:34,150 --> 03:16:34,870
Alright.

4545
03:16:36,270 --> 03:16:37,230
Here we go.

4546
03:16:39,510 --> 03:16:41,850
We'll figure it out together, guys.

4547
03:16:42,090 --> 03:16:44,890
We're gonna figure it out together.

4548
03:16:46,830 --> 03:16:47,470
Oh, I...

4549
03:16:47,990 --> 03:16:48,970
Guys, I fucked up.

4550
03:16:48,990 --> 03:16:49,430
I fucked up already.

4551
03:16:49,610 --> 03:16:50,830
I need to end the match.

4552
03:16:51,030 --> 03:16:52,250
I already fucked up my first.

4553
03:16:52,530 --> 03:16:53,250
I already...

4554
03:16:53,250 --> 03:16:55,470
I already fucked up.

4555
03:16:55,810 --> 03:16:57,530
I can't eat anything.

4556
03:16:57,730 --> 03:17:00,070
I accidentally pressed 2.

4557
03:17:00,690 --> 03:17:02,670
No, you're supposed to end me.

4558
03:17:03,770 --> 03:17:04,930
What the fuck?

4559
03:17:06,130 --> 03:17:06,730
Please.

4560
03:17:07,710 --> 03:17:09,310
Please stop talking.

4561
03:17:09,310 --> 03:17:10,490
Oh, now...

4562
03:17:10,490 --> 03:17:12,770
Oh, now you're gonna talk.

4563
03:17:13,030 --> 03:17:15,510
Oh my god, bro.

4564
03:17:15,950 --> 03:17:17,330
Bro, come on.

4565
03:17:20,070 --> 03:17:22,290
Now he wants to talk.

4566
03:17:22,830 --> 03:17:25,050
This is actually crazy.

4567
03:17:28,150 --> 03:17:30,670
Okay, this time...

4568
03:17:30,670 --> 03:17:32,630
This time we can do it.

4569
03:17:32,870 --> 03:17:33,590
Okay.

4570
03:17:33,990 --> 03:17:34,810
That doesn't count!

4571
03:17:35,130 --> 03:17:36,110
That's not...

4572
03:17:36,110 --> 03:17:37,090
That does not count.

4573
03:17:37,470 --> 03:17:38,410
I lost...

4574
03:17:38,410 --> 03:17:39,850
I fucked up my...

4575
03:17:39,850 --> 03:17:42,350
I fucked up my spell casting.

4576
03:17:44,810 --> 03:17:46,390
That doesn't count, guys.

4577
03:17:46,390 --> 03:17:48,330
Guys, I fucked up my spellcasting chat.

4578
03:17:48,670 --> 03:17:50,790
That does not fucking count.

4579
03:17:51,170 --> 03:17:52,910
That does not count.

4580
03:17:54,050 --> 03:17:55,810
I messed it up.

4581
03:17:56,290 --> 03:17:57,690
I pressed 2.

4582
03:18:01,490 --> 03:18:03,230
I just let him hit me.

4583
03:18:09,450 --> 03:18:17,810
What the fuck?

4584
03:18:17,990 --> 03:18:19,250
Now he doesn't let me hit him.

4585
03:18:23,930 --> 03:18:24,650
That's fucking right.

4586
03:18:27,550 --> 03:18:28,350
Oh shit.

4587
03:18:28,830 --> 03:18:29,230
Fuck.

4588
03:18:29,390 --> 03:18:29,650
Okay.

4589
03:18:31,390 --> 03:18:32,450
Alright, he can do that.

4590
03:18:32,750 --> 03:18:33,710
And I can do that.

4591
03:18:34,430 --> 03:18:35,590
And then I can do that.

4592
03:18:36,610 --> 03:18:37,790
And then I can be like...

4593
03:18:42,030 --> 03:18:42,830
Oh shit.

4594
03:18:42,970 --> 03:18:43,270
Okay.

4595
03:18:43,550 --> 03:18:44,130
That's not cool.

4596
03:18:46,850 --> 03:18:47,650
That's fucking right.

4597
03:18:48,590 --> 03:18:48,990
Oh.

4598
03:18:49,470 --> 03:18:49,870
Nope.

4599
03:18:50,050 --> 03:18:50,450
Nope.

4600
03:18:50,750 --> 03:18:51,650
We are not getting it.

4601
03:18:51,670 --> 03:18:52,390
You're not getting me this time.

4602
03:18:52,670 --> 03:18:54,390
You're not getting me this time.

4603
03:18:59,830 --> 03:19:00,590
That's fine.

4604
03:19:00,690 --> 03:19:00,930
Okay.

4605
03:19:02,730 --> 03:19:03,550
That's fine.

4606
03:19:04,590 --> 03:19:05,910
Stumble again, bitch.

4607
03:19:07,610 --> 03:19:08,210
Okay.

4608
03:19:08,990 --> 03:19:10,030
Stamina recharge.

4609
03:19:10,350 --> 03:19:11,290
Stamina recharge.

4610
03:19:12,410 --> 03:19:13,610
Oh no.

4611
03:19:13,690 --> 03:19:14,410
Not this move.

4612
03:19:14,730 --> 03:19:15,210
Okay.

4613
03:19:15,250 --> 03:19:16,510
I'm not risking this move.

4614
03:19:16,970 --> 03:19:20,750
I'm not risking that move, man.

4615
03:19:23,010 --> 03:19:24,470
This move is fucked.

4616
03:19:26,410 --> 03:19:29,590
Bro I'm not trusting myself against that.

4617
03:19:33,190 --> 03:19:33,930
What???

4618
03:19:33,930 --> 03:19:35,230
That still hits me?

4619
03:19:36,310 --> 03:19:37,050
Okay.

4620
03:19:37,310 --> 03:19:38,210
Fuck off.

4621
03:19:40,890 --> 03:19:41,630
Okay.

4622
03:19:42,170 --> 03:19:42,910
What???

4623
03:19:42,910 --> 03:19:43,450
Okay.

4624
03:19:43,670 --> 03:19:44,210
That's fine.

4625
03:19:45,950 --> 03:19:46,970
That's fine.

4626
03:19:48,670 --> 03:19:49,630
That's fine.

4627
03:19:53,230 --> 03:19:54,830
Okay, that's also fine.

4628
03:20:21,380 --> 03:20:23,080
Is this scripted?

4629
03:20:23,080 --> 03:20:24,220
Oh, what?

4630
03:20:27,580 --> 03:20:28,840
Oh, that's scripted.

4631
03:20:28,840 --> 03:20:30,940
Oh, thank god, that's scripted.

4632
03:20:32,280 --> 03:20:34,920
Thank god, that's actually scripted.

4633
03:20:35,440 --> 03:20:39,180
Okay, that's gonna be like, that's so bullshit.

4634
03:20:39,640 --> 03:20:44,260
Oh my god, she's so angry if it was not scripted.

4635
03:20:46,440 --> 03:20:47,680
Where am I?

4636
03:20:54,210 --> 03:20:55,830
Get into the sack.

4637
03:21:06,340 --> 03:21:09,200
I don't like that he's just watching me like that.

4638
03:21:09,740 --> 03:21:10,800
Fucking freak.

4639
03:21:14,060 --> 03:21:16,500
Monkey is stored in the sack.

4640
03:21:21,760 --> 03:21:22,800
What's going on?

4641
03:21:24,180 --> 03:21:25,340
Wait, Pigsy?

4642
03:21:25,600 --> 03:21:26,240
Chewbacca!

4643
03:21:26,900 --> 03:21:28,280
What are you doing here?

4644
03:21:29,060 --> 03:21:30,620
Wait, you got trapped too?

4645
03:21:42,530 --> 03:21:44,230
Look chat, Doki went inside.

4646
03:21:44,230 --> 03:21:44,950
Oh, no!

4647
03:21:46,470 --> 03:21:47,190
He sucked.

4648
03:21:47,270 --> 03:21:48,030
Thank you, Mr. Pigsy.

4649
03:21:48,130 --> 03:21:48,730
Thank you, thank you.

4650
03:21:50,090 --> 03:21:52,250
Oh yeah, we're both, we both got caught.

4651
03:21:56,890 --> 03:21:58,090
Wait, is that my sack?

4652
03:22:00,910 --> 03:22:02,770
Yeah, I was gonna say, this is Wukong's sack.

4653
03:22:08,810 --> 03:22:10,170
Oh no, he has wings again.

4654
03:22:17,210 --> 03:22:17,890
Okay, it's fine.

4655
03:22:17,990 --> 03:22:19,110
It's two against one.

4656
03:22:19,770 --> 03:22:21,490
Oh, it might not be fine though.

4657
03:22:21,550 --> 03:22:24,190
Oh, it might not be fine.

4658
03:22:24,910 --> 03:22:26,570
I'm gonna drink this just in case.

4659
03:22:28,810 --> 03:22:30,390
Chewbacca, hit him for me!

4660
03:22:30,830 --> 03:22:31,310
Nice.

4661
03:22:34,090 --> 03:22:34,570
Nice.

4662
03:22:34,890 --> 03:22:35,590
He's helping.

4663
03:22:36,090 --> 03:22:39,270
Oh god, you're supposed to help me even more!

4664
03:22:40,970 --> 03:22:42,350
Oh no, okay.

4665
03:22:44,250 --> 03:22:45,010
It's fine.

4666
03:22:45,590 --> 03:22:46,150
No!

4667
03:22:46,430 --> 03:22:48,210
It's not fine!

4668
03:22:48,470 --> 03:22:49,790
No, it's not fine!

4669
03:22:50,190 --> 03:22:51,430
It's not fine!

4670
03:22:51,990 --> 03:22:52,770
It's not!

4671
03:22:53,230 --> 03:22:53,710
Heal me!

4672
03:22:53,990 --> 03:22:55,030
Heal me, pig!

4673
03:22:55,270 --> 03:22:55,930
Heal me!

4674
03:22:58,310 --> 03:22:59,870
Which one's the real one?

4675
03:23:00,810 --> 03:23:01,110
No!

4676
03:23:01,690 --> 03:23:02,790
Oh, there he is!

4677
03:23:03,190 --> 03:23:04,230
There he is!

4678
03:23:05,710 --> 03:23:08,270
Oh, am I gonna die?

4679
03:23:08,330 --> 03:23:09,030
I'm gonna die!

4680
03:23:09,070 --> 03:23:09,610
I'm gonna die!

4681
03:23:09,790 --> 03:23:10,010
No!

4682
03:23:13,210 --> 03:23:15,250
It's too much!

4683
03:23:15,330 --> 03:23:15,550
No!

4684
03:23:15,690 --> 03:23:16,910
I have to do it again!

4685
03:23:17,730 --> 03:23:19,750
I have to do this fight again!

4686
03:23:23,330 --> 03:23:26,870
I have to do phase one again!

4687
03:23:28,510 --> 03:23:30,570
Oh my god!

4688
03:23:32,090 --> 03:23:33,610
Oh no!

4689
03:23:34,910 --> 03:23:37,770
I had to go back into the side!

4690
03:23:39,270 --> 03:23:42,290
I had to get into the side.

4691
03:23:44,150 --> 03:23:47,010
I had to fucking...

4692
03:23:48,010 --> 03:23:51,790
Fight the fucking man-baby again!

4693
03:23:53,890 --> 03:23:56,490
Just absorb me in the sack right now!

4694
03:23:59,970 --> 03:24:01,350
Oh my god!

4695
03:24:01,630 --> 03:24:02,330
Oh!

4696
03:24:02,450 --> 03:24:03,270
Thank god!

4697
03:24:03,890 --> 03:24:04,610
Oh!

4698
03:24:04,690 --> 03:24:06,230
Thank god!

4699
03:24:06,230 --> 03:24:07,630
I'm so happy!

4700
03:24:08,050 --> 03:24:09,930
Oh my god!

4701
03:24:09,930 --> 03:24:11,790
I'm okay with this!

4702
03:24:11,910 --> 03:24:12,710
I'm okay!

4703
03:24:12,870 --> 03:24:13,390
Yes!

4704
03:24:13,390 --> 03:24:16,550
He instantly transported me into the sack!

4705
03:24:16,990 --> 03:24:18,210
I fucked up though!

4706
03:24:18,250 --> 03:24:19,130
I used my magic!

4707
03:24:21,130 --> 03:24:21,830
It's okay!

4708
03:24:21,990 --> 03:24:24,370
I wanted to die because I fucked up!

4709
03:24:24,490 --> 03:24:26,190
You heal too late, pigsy!

4710
03:24:26,250 --> 03:24:27,270
You heal too late!

4711
03:24:28,250 --> 03:24:28,770
Alright!

4712
03:24:28,770 --> 03:24:29,870
Accident press 2!

4713
03:24:34,870 --> 03:24:36,210
Galix thank you for the super chat!

4714
03:24:36,310 --> 03:24:37,190
Thank you for the magenta soup!

4715
03:24:37,350 --> 03:24:38,090
Thank you!

4716
03:24:38,090 --> 03:24:38,670
Thank you!

4717
03:24:38,710 --> 03:24:39,310
Thank you!

4718
03:24:39,310 --> 03:24:40,650
Did you just call him a pig?

4719
03:24:40,830 --> 03:24:41,610
How dare you!

4720
03:24:41,690 --> 03:24:44,650
I bet there are plenty of spiders who want to marry him!

4721
03:24:44,770 --> 03:24:46,050
Thank you for the magenta soup!

4722
03:24:46,230 --> 03:24:46,630
Thank you!

4723
03:24:46,750 --> 03:24:46,990
Thank you!

4724
03:24:47,050 --> 03:24:48,930
There's nothing wrong with being a pig!

4725
03:24:49,250 --> 03:24:50,530
There's nothing wrong!

4726
03:24:52,890 --> 03:24:53,390
Okay.

4727
03:24:54,070 --> 03:24:55,270
There's nothing wrong!

4728
03:24:56,330 --> 03:24:57,050
There's nothing!

4729
03:24:57,150 --> 03:25:00,490
If a spider wants to bang a pig, let her bang a pig!

4730
03:25:04,410 --> 03:25:04,910
Oh!

4731
03:25:06,070 --> 03:25:06,870
My god!

4732
03:25:12,730 --> 03:25:14,150
Oh shit!

4733
03:25:14,290 --> 03:25:15,810
Did I use it?

4734
03:25:16,090 --> 03:25:17,870
Oh my god!

4735
03:25:17,990 --> 03:25:19,390
Are you really serious?

4736
03:25:19,490 --> 03:25:21,190
He interrupted it!

4737
03:25:23,910 --> 03:25:26,210
He actually interrupted it!

4738
03:25:26,230 --> 03:25:27,090
This little fucker!

4739
03:25:29,030 --> 03:25:31,230
I can't believe it.

4740
03:25:31,370 --> 03:25:34,510
He actually interrupted my post.

4741
03:25:35,070 --> 03:25:36,810
That's so fucked.

4742
03:25:36,930 --> 03:25:39,410
That's so actually fucked, man.

4743
03:25:40,550 --> 03:25:42,870
It's not a skill issue!

4744
03:25:44,110 --> 03:25:45,870
You fucking cheated!

4745
03:25:46,410 --> 03:25:48,310
You fucking cheated!

4746
03:25:49,010 --> 03:25:50,770
You fucking cheated!

4747
03:25:51,210 --> 03:25:53,630
I refuse to believe it's a skill issue!

4748
03:25:55,730 --> 03:25:57,130
Oh my god.

4749
03:25:57,290 --> 03:25:59,010
No, not the shadow jutsu.

4750
03:26:03,710 --> 03:26:06,770
Oh my god, this is hell!

4751
03:26:06,770 --> 03:26:08,550
This is hell!

4752
03:26:09,410 --> 03:26:10,510
This is hell!

4753
03:26:10,730 --> 03:26:13,770
Oh my god, there's too many...

4754
03:26:14,770 --> 03:26:16,270
There's too many monkeys!

4755
03:26:18,890 --> 03:26:20,650
Too many monkeys!

4756
03:26:25,890 --> 03:26:26,690
What?!

4757
03:26:27,510 --> 03:26:28,990
That should not have hit me.

4758
03:26:29,190 --> 03:26:30,570
That was actually bullshit.

4759
03:26:32,910 --> 03:26:33,890
Oh god.

4760
03:26:34,470 --> 03:26:36,150
Oh my god, bro.

4761
03:26:36,150 --> 03:26:36,670
He's so...

4762
03:26:36,670 --> 03:26:37,850
He's so scary.

4763
03:26:40,070 --> 03:26:42,330
Oh fuck, bro.

4764
03:26:49,060 --> 03:26:52,380
He actually interrupted it again.

4765
03:26:52,500 --> 03:26:54,060
Are you fucking serious?

4766
03:26:54,740 --> 03:26:55,260
I...

4767
03:26:57,280 --> 03:26:58,700
He's so fast.

4768
03:26:59,520 --> 03:27:02,020
Why did he put him in the pouch?

4769
03:27:04,540 --> 03:27:05,240
Okay.

4770
03:27:05,560 --> 03:27:07,980
Wait, can I use it before the fight?

4771
03:27:08,960 --> 03:27:10,520
Can I actually do that?

4772
03:27:11,780 --> 03:27:12,260
Okay.

4773
03:27:12,320 --> 03:27:12,980
Use it outside?

4774
03:27:13,140 --> 03:27:14,240
Oh my god I'm gonna use it outside.

4775
03:27:14,480 --> 03:27:15,020
Dude fuck this.

4776
03:27:15,260 --> 03:27:16,700
Fuck that fucking monkey.

4777
03:27:16,860 --> 03:27:19,220
I hate that monkey so much.

4778
03:27:22,880 --> 03:27:25,140
Oh my god, he's so strong.

4779
03:27:25,460 --> 03:27:26,660
Guys, he's so strong.

4780
03:27:35,160 --> 03:27:36,940
My god, you lied to me!

4781
03:27:37,080 --> 03:27:38,000
I have to use it here!

4782
03:27:41,380 --> 03:27:43,680
I CAN'T JUST USE IT OUTSIDE!

4783
03:27:45,380 --> 03:27:47,400
Wait, how does that hurt me?

4784
03:27:48,180 --> 03:27:48,300
What?

4785
03:27:52,920 --> 03:27:53,960
Okay, nice.

4786
03:27:57,270 --> 03:27:58,230
Okay, nice.

4787
03:27:58,510 --> 03:27:59,130
WHOA!

4788
03:27:59,170 --> 03:28:01,150
Okay, that's a lot of damage.

4789
03:28:01,570 --> 03:28:03,890
For the poke?

4790
03:28:04,230 --> 03:28:05,570
Holy shit!

4791
03:28:09,170 --> 03:28:09,730
Okay.

4792
03:28:10,250 --> 03:28:10,810
OH!

4793
03:28:11,330 --> 03:28:13,050
THE SHADOW CLOUDS!

4794
03:28:13,410 --> 03:28:15,870
THE FUCKING SHADOW CLOUDS!

4795
03:28:16,930 --> 03:28:17,970
Oh god, no.

4796
03:28:19,810 --> 03:28:20,630
Oh god.

4797
03:28:22,050 --> 03:28:22,610
Okay.

4798
03:28:23,650 --> 03:28:24,210
Okay.

4799
03:28:24,550 --> 03:28:25,290
That's fine.

4800
03:28:28,110 --> 03:28:28,670
Poke!

4801
03:28:28,770 --> 03:28:30,370
Okay, I wanted to get that in first.

4802
03:28:30,550 --> 03:28:32,130
Before he does anything else.

4803
03:28:34,130 --> 03:28:34,690
Okay.

4804
03:28:35,570 --> 03:28:36,330
What is he doing?

4805
03:28:36,570 --> 03:28:37,750
Wait, what is he doing?

4806
03:28:38,490 --> 03:28:39,870
What is he doing?

4807
03:28:40,130 --> 03:28:41,270
Wait, did he heal?

4808
03:28:42,210 --> 03:28:43,970
I don't know.

4809
03:28:47,210 --> 03:28:48,250
Holy shit!

4810
03:28:49,150 --> 03:28:50,570
Please, Pixie, help me!

4811
03:28:51,110 --> 03:28:51,630
Please!

4812
03:28:53,330 --> 03:28:54,470
Thank you, Pixie!

4813
03:28:58,830 --> 03:29:00,250
Oh my god, first!

4814
03:29:00,590 --> 03:29:01,390
Oh thank god!

4815
03:29:01,670 --> 03:29:02,630
Oh no!

4816
03:29:05,570 --> 03:29:06,470
Nothing good!

4817
03:29:07,230 --> 03:29:08,270
Nothing good!

4818
03:29:09,950 --> 03:29:11,470
Okay, Pixie, your turn!

4819
03:29:11,590 --> 03:29:12,470
Your turn!

4820
03:29:14,350 --> 03:29:14,990
No!

4821
03:29:17,650 --> 03:29:18,810
Pixie, it's your turn!

4822
03:29:21,510 --> 03:29:22,810
Please, it's your turn!

4823
03:29:22,950 --> 03:29:23,910
He's literally right there!

4824
03:29:27,810 --> 03:29:28,450
WHOA!

4825
03:29:29,550 --> 03:29:30,370
Oh god.

4826
03:29:30,490 --> 03:29:31,030
Okay.

4827
03:29:33,350 --> 03:29:33,670
Please!

4828
03:29:34,150 --> 03:29:35,470
Please be involved!

4829
03:29:39,450 --> 03:29:40,050
Please!

4830
03:29:40,190 --> 03:29:40,790
Please!

4831
03:29:40,930 --> 03:29:41,290
Please be involved!

4832
03:29:41,430 --> 03:29:42,550
That's all I ask you!

4833
03:29:43,170 --> 03:29:43,770
Please!

4834
03:29:44,810 --> 03:29:46,330
Please, just hit him!

4835
03:29:50,030 --> 03:29:51,450
He's literally right there!

4836
03:29:51,930 --> 03:29:52,530
He's literally right there!

4837
03:29:52,530 --> 03:29:53,250
Just hit him!

4838
03:30:03,860 --> 03:30:04,460
Died!

4839
03:30:04,600 --> 03:30:07,160
He got the last hit!

4840
03:30:07,440 --> 03:30:08,780
Oh my god!

4841
03:30:09,800 --> 03:30:11,860
He actually hit him!

4842
03:30:14,240 --> 03:30:14,720
Finally!

4843
03:30:15,160 --> 03:30:15,640
Finally!

4844
03:30:15,740 --> 03:30:17,480
You did it when it matters!

4845
03:30:22,120 --> 03:30:22,600
Salve!

4846
03:30:26,680 --> 03:30:27,340
That's right!

4847
03:30:27,620 --> 03:30:29,800
I'm the stronger monkey!

4848
03:30:35,090 --> 03:30:36,010
What am I doing?

4849
03:30:36,110 --> 03:30:36,730
Why am I hesitating?

4850
03:30:36,910 --> 03:30:37,230
Do it!

4851
03:30:37,730 --> 03:30:38,350
Do it!

4852
03:30:40,050 --> 03:30:41,110
Oh, you did it!

4853
03:30:43,030 --> 03:30:44,590
I am the true monkey!

4854
03:30:56,240 --> 03:30:56,800
Huh?

4855
03:30:57,060 --> 03:30:57,160
Huh?

4856
03:30:58,540 --> 03:30:59,700
That's the point, right?

4857
03:31:07,080 --> 03:31:09,180
That's the point, right?

4858
03:31:09,180 --> 03:31:09,480
What the?

4859
03:31:09,600 --> 03:31:09,920
Huh?

4860
03:31:14,560 --> 03:31:17,240
Wait, am I the crazy monkey now?

4861
03:31:26,560 --> 03:31:27,620
The sword?

4862
03:31:27,720 --> 03:31:29,100
Am I evil monkey?

4863
03:31:47,930 --> 03:31:48,670
No...

4864
03:31:49,810 --> 03:31:52,330
I'm crazy monkey... I'm wind ball!

4865
03:31:52,970 --> 03:31:55,850
The crazier I get, the less hair I have!

4866
03:32:09,410 --> 03:32:10,770
Something says I should just run.

4867
03:32:11,670 --> 03:32:12,630
Oh my god!

4868
03:32:12,670 --> 03:32:13,230
Look at me!

4869
03:32:13,250 --> 03:32:14,190
I went full monkey!

4870
03:32:16,930 --> 03:32:18,350
I'm full monkey!

4871
03:32:18,550 --> 03:32:18,810
Oh!

4872
03:32:24,250 --> 03:32:25,210
I'm monkey!

4873
03:32:26,770 --> 03:32:27,990
Get me out of here!

4874
03:32:29,150 --> 03:32:30,770
Never go full monkey!

4875
03:32:37,080 --> 03:32:39,200
No, not the light!

4876
03:32:39,500 --> 03:32:41,380
Monkey doesn't want light!

4877
03:32:42,180 --> 03:32:44,220
Monkey doesn't want light!

4878
03:32:45,480 --> 03:32:46,060
Get out!

4879
03:32:47,240 --> 03:32:48,080
Monkey...

4880
03:32:54,940 --> 03:32:56,060
Don't kill?

4881
03:32:57,800 --> 03:32:59,340
What happens when I kill?

4882
03:33:00,700 --> 03:33:01,940
Do I turn crazy?

4883
03:33:02,800 --> 03:33:04,380
Oh no, I already killed.

4884
03:33:05,700 --> 03:33:06,580
Instructions unclear.

4885
03:33:06,760 --> 03:33:08,100
I stabbed a few.

4886
03:33:10,740 --> 03:33:11,700
Instructions unclear.

4887
03:33:11,900 --> 03:33:14,180
I accidentally stabbed a few.

4888
03:33:14,560 --> 03:33:18,280
I accidentally stabbed a few.

4889
03:33:19,580 --> 03:33:21,220
Too late now.

4890
03:33:21,380 --> 03:33:23,140
I didn't know I was supposed...

4891
03:33:23,140 --> 03:33:24,900
I didn't know I was supposed to stab!

4892
03:33:27,060 --> 03:33:29,420
Oh sh....

4893
03:33:29,420 --> 03:33:31,340
I... I stabbed...

4894
03:33:31,340 --> 03:33:34,000
It's too late now!

4895
03:33:34,400 --> 03:33:35,080
No!

4896
03:33:45,470 --> 03:33:47,530
Don't say it!

4897
03:33:47,870 --> 03:33:49,670
Don't say the reset!

4898
03:33:49,850 --> 03:33:50,350
Don't...

4899
03:33:50,350 --> 03:33:53,670
Don't say that, guys!

4900
03:33:54,010 --> 03:33:54,730
Please!

4901
03:33:56,150 --> 03:33:56,750
I didn't...

4902
03:33:57,650 --> 03:33:58,650
I...

4903
03:34:07,210 --> 03:34:08,110
It's okay.

4904
03:34:09,190 --> 03:34:10,510
It's okay, I died.

4905
03:34:10,730 --> 03:34:18,230
I purposely died, so... I purposely died, so I don't... I purposely died, guys!

4906
03:34:18,650 --> 03:34:20,790
So, like, I didn't... yeah!

4907
03:34:21,110 --> 03:34:22,050
There we go!

4908
03:34:22,730 --> 03:34:23,710
There we go!

4909
03:34:25,070 --> 03:34:26,070
There we go!

4910
03:34:26,070 --> 03:34:26,070
Wait!

4911
03:34:26,710 --> 03:34:28,150
Oh no!

4912
03:34:28,350 --> 03:34:29,610
I'm here!

4913
03:34:31,370 --> 03:34:32,250
Don't!

4914
03:34:32,250 --> 03:34:36,610
You have to be fucking with me!

4915
03:34:37,470 --> 03:34:40,210
There's no way!

4916
03:34:40,690 --> 03:34:44,890
I refuse to believe you're fucking with me!

4917
03:34:44,990 --> 03:34:46,010
There's no way!

4918
03:34:46,330 --> 03:34:49,290
You have to be fucking with me!

4919
03:34:51,470 --> 03:34:52,610
Oh no!

4920
03:34:53,030 --> 03:34:54,150
Oh no!

4921
03:34:55,350 --> 03:34:56,310
Oh no!

4922
03:34:57,010 --> 03:34:58,110
There's no way!

4923
03:35:01,150 --> 03:35:03,150
I don't believe in him!

4924
03:35:08,010 --> 03:35:09,810
No, it can't be true!

4925
03:35:10,090 --> 03:35:11,150
It can't be true!

4926
03:35:11,370 --> 03:35:12,550
It can't be true!

4927
03:35:12,950 --> 03:35:14,730
They were evil first!

4928
03:35:15,190 --> 03:35:18,410
It was self-defense!

4929
03:35:19,510 --> 03:35:21,770
We all know it was self-defense!

4930
03:35:21,990 --> 03:35:22,850
You all saw it!

4931
03:35:25,050 --> 03:35:26,050
Oh no!

4932
03:35:26,170 --> 03:35:27,410
Oh no!

4933
03:35:28,970 --> 03:35:31,470
What the fuck did he do to me?

4934
03:35:37,700 --> 03:35:38,920
But he's evil!

4935
03:35:40,380 --> 03:35:41,020
What?

4936
03:35:45,100 --> 03:35:46,640
Oh my god!

4937
03:35:46,680 --> 03:35:47,540
Monkey's sad!

4938
03:35:55,910 --> 03:35:56,430
Okay.

4939
03:35:56,430 --> 03:35:58,290
What the fuck?

4940
03:35:59,590 --> 03:36:01,130
What the fuck?

4941
03:36:01,370 --> 03:36:02,510
What am I getting?

4942
03:36:02,770 --> 03:36:04,250
Ring of electricity!

4943
03:36:05,910 --> 03:36:07,810
What the fuck is this bullshit?

4944
03:36:10,330 --> 03:36:12,110
This is a bullshit boss fight.

4945
03:36:12,170 --> 03:36:13,130
I hate this boss fight.

4946
03:36:13,510 --> 03:36:14,910
I... I...

4947
03:36:15,470 --> 03:36:17,590
Oh, someone said I just need to do that.

4948
03:36:18,150 --> 03:36:18,670
Nice.

4949
03:36:19,690 --> 03:36:20,210
Okay.

4950
03:36:20,810 --> 03:36:21,570
Thank god.

4951
03:36:23,110 --> 03:36:24,370
Thank fucking god.

4952
03:36:24,410 --> 03:36:25,850
Get this guy away from me.

4953
03:36:26,490 --> 03:36:27,530
Get him away.

4954
03:36:29,970 --> 03:36:30,490
Woo!

4955
03:36:31,730 --> 03:36:32,250
Okay.

4956
03:36:32,490 --> 03:36:32,970
Wow!

4957
03:36:34,330 --> 03:36:34,850
Okay.

4958
03:36:34,850 --> 03:36:35,370
Wow!

4959
03:36:36,030 --> 03:36:36,950
Get out.

4960
03:36:37,850 --> 03:36:38,370
Okay.

4961
03:36:38,370 --> 03:36:38,970
It's fine.

4962
03:36:39,670 --> 03:36:41,930
I'll keep the... I'll keep the... the three points.

4963
03:36:42,030 --> 03:36:42,650
No, no.

4964
03:36:42,770 --> 03:36:43,510
Oh, no.

4965
03:36:43,550 --> 03:36:43,990
Not again.

4966
03:36:44,370 --> 03:36:45,190
Oh, no.

4967
03:36:45,550 --> 03:36:46,430
Oh, no.

4968
03:36:46,490 --> 03:36:47,070
Not again.

4969
03:36:47,270 --> 03:36:47,690
No!

4970
03:36:48,190 --> 03:36:51,430
I hate this man.

4971
03:36:51,790 --> 03:36:53,170
Oh my god.

4972
03:36:53,190 --> 03:36:54,550
Now where am I going?

4973
03:36:55,810 --> 03:36:58,370
Now he has another combo?

4974
03:37:00,810 --> 03:37:02,930
This is absolutely bullshit.

4975
03:37:03,310 --> 03:37:06,690
You should not be allowed three different fucking combos.

4976
03:37:08,290 --> 03:37:11,670
This is absolutely bullshit.

4977
03:37:11,670 --> 03:37:12,630
Like...

4978
03:37:16,550 --> 03:37:18,910
Like, why does he get all of that?

4979
03:37:23,350 --> 03:37:23,950
Okay.

4980
03:37:23,950 --> 03:37:24,750
That's fine.

4981
03:37:25,670 --> 03:37:26,690
That is fine.

4982
03:37:27,050 --> 03:37:27,990
Turn god!

4983
03:37:28,070 --> 03:37:29,290
Turn god, you fucker!

4984
03:37:30,470 --> 03:37:31,430
Turn god!

4985
03:37:34,030 --> 03:37:34,990
Turn god!

4986
03:37:38,170 --> 03:37:39,470
I'm ready for you!

4987
03:37:40,250 --> 03:37:40,850
What?

4988
03:37:40,950 --> 03:37:41,530
That hit me?

4989
03:37:43,190 --> 03:37:43,710
Okay.

4990
03:37:44,750 --> 03:37:45,530
That's fucked.

4991
03:37:45,790 --> 03:37:46,770
Oh shit!

4992
03:37:46,970 --> 03:37:47,950
That's fucked too.

4993
03:37:50,210 --> 03:37:50,730
Alright.

4994
03:37:51,390 --> 03:37:52,050
Come on!

4995
03:37:52,130 --> 03:37:52,570
Turn god!

4996
03:37:56,410 --> 03:37:57,850
Turn fucking god!

4997
03:38:02,170 --> 03:38:03,210
Jesus Christ.

4998
03:38:04,070 --> 03:38:04,950
That's fucking right!

4999
03:38:04,990 --> 03:38:05,510
I have this!

5000
03:38:06,010 --> 03:38:06,530
Boom!

5001
03:38:06,590 --> 03:38:08,050
Just for when you turn god!

5002
03:38:08,910 --> 03:38:10,070
That's fucking right!

5003
03:38:13,070 --> 03:38:14,330
That's fucking right!

5004
03:38:14,350 --> 03:38:15,030
Turn god again!

5005
03:38:15,210 --> 03:38:15,370
That's fucking right!

5006
03:38:15,370 --> 03:38:15,370
Turn god again!

5007
03:38:15,370 --> 03:38:15,770
Ganderia!

5008
03:38:17,670 --> 03:38:19,350
Fuck you!

5009
03:38:20,130 --> 03:38:21,830
Fuck you!

5010
03:38:22,230 --> 03:38:23,570
Come on!

5011
03:38:24,330 --> 03:38:30,550
I could have seen your end.

5012
03:38:31,310 --> 03:38:40,230
As long as you keep fighting for others, you will die in their hands sooner or later.

5013
03:38:45,730 --> 03:38:46,770
Or yourself?

5014
03:38:46,990 --> 03:38:47,690
That's greedy.

5015
03:38:48,310 --> 03:38:49,770
That's not the Buddha way.

5016
03:38:50,950 --> 03:38:51,870
Oh, it's him.

5017
03:38:53,350 --> 03:38:54,470
It's Man Bird.

5018
03:39:15,100 --> 03:39:15,940
Phase 5?

5019
03:39:17,340 --> 03:39:19,920
What do you mean Phase 5?

5020
03:39:20,560 --> 03:39:23,080
We're going to turn into Iceman now?

5021
03:39:23,100 --> 03:39:24,100
Iceman baby?

5022
03:39:25,440 --> 03:39:26,980
Oh, there's no way.

5023
03:39:35,290 --> 03:39:36,910
Where did you come from?

5024
03:39:37,050 --> 03:39:38,070
Good Buddha?

5025
03:39:45,330 --> 03:39:46,810
夜初早先拐了我的宝贝下界。又借大圣之力,把我的后天道变成了销魂夺魄的邪宝。

5026
03:39:48,650 --> 03:39:51,630
还化作我模样,假我之名,狂来了许多旧传。

5027
03:39:51,650 --> 03:39:53,010
一心成梦。

5028
03:39:53,010 --> 03:39:57,990
Oh, you pretended to fake... Bro, you just slapped the Buddha.

5029
03:39:58,390 --> 03:39:59,270
我总该猜到是你。

5030
03:40:00,650 --> 03:40:03,350
恕罪,恕罪。

5031
03:40:03,350 --> 03:40:07,890
管你一次,我信。管你两次,朱都不信。

5032
03:40:12,470 --> 03:40:13,870
我也不信。谁知这孽畜胆子这么大。

5033
03:40:16,690 --> 03:40:19,490
我本要亲自收他,不料两位施主先到。

5034
03:40:19,490 --> 03:40:20,390
无能。

5035
03:40:22,750 --> 03:40:24,150
你自是福大命大。

5036
03:40:24,150 --> 03:40:29,010
而他,年纪轻轻,竟如此了得。

5037
03:40:29,650 --> 03:40:33,870
这回或许,没看错人。

5038
03:40:34,010 --> 03:40:34,710
Yeah!

5039
03:40:35,190 --> 03:40:37,370
I'm the chosen one!

5040
03:40:39,670 --> 03:40:42,470
大师兄的东西若是丢了,再找寻起来就难了。

5041
03:40:42,470 --> 03:40:44,810
哈哈哈哈哈哈。

5042
03:40:45,650 --> 03:40:47,250
Isn't that the really?

5043
03:40:48,750 --> 03:40:50,150
且借我用用。

5044
03:40:57,920 --> 03:40:58,800
What is he doing?

5045
03:40:58,840 --> 03:40:59,020
What is he doing?

5046
03:41:00,080 --> 03:41:01,020
What is he gonna fish?

5047
03:41:01,480 --> 03:41:03,240
Am I gonna fucking fight a fish?

5048
03:41:31,510 --> 03:41:32,550
What the fuck?

5049
03:41:38,360 --> 03:41:39,620
Am I gonna fight him?

5050
03:41:43,150 --> 03:41:44,230
Oh, thank God.

5051
03:41:44,290 --> 03:41:45,070
Okay, I'm not.

5052
03:41:46,930 --> 03:41:48,170
It's animation time.

5053
03:41:58,360 --> 03:41:59,540
Oh, it's a new style.

5054
03:42:00,480 --> 03:42:01,880
It's a new animation style.

5055
03:42:04,020 --> 03:42:05,800
Oh, thank God it was over.

5056
03:42:06,420 --> 03:42:08,480
Okay, so, what the fuck?

5057
03:42:10,080 --> 03:42:11,260
Is that him?

5058
03:42:11,420 --> 03:42:12,300
Is that the...

5059
03:42:12,900 --> 03:42:13,720
The dead?

5060
03:42:13,840 --> 03:42:14,440
Oh, no.

5061
03:42:15,660 --> 03:42:17,300
No, that's somebody else.

5062
03:42:20,830 --> 03:42:22,090
Is he gonna give birth?

5063
03:42:23,990 --> 03:42:24,570
Oh.

5064
03:42:37,840 --> 03:42:38,420
Oh.

5065
03:42:40,100 --> 03:42:40,680
Easy.

5066
03:42:42,500 --> 03:42:43,780
It's like a...

5067
03:42:44,860 --> 03:42:45,440
哈哈哈哈。

5068
03:42:45,440 --> 03:42:48,400
Let me sneeze on you and then you can be beautiful.

5069
03:42:50,640 --> 03:42:51,260
哈哈哈哈。

5070
03:42:56,970 --> 03:42:58,550
Yeah, it's a softshell turtle.

5071
03:43:03,510 --> 03:43:06,270
Oh, and then the city prospered because of him.

5072
03:43:11,970 --> 03:43:13,750
He became like a god.

5073
03:43:34,930 --> 03:43:38,350
He provide like diamonds and pearls.

5074
03:43:42,470 --> 03:43:44,370
I feel like he could be a demon.

5075
03:43:44,550 --> 03:43:45,230
A Yaoguai.

5076
03:43:46,210 --> 03:43:47,770
And not like an actual...

5077
03:43:48,610 --> 03:43:49,190
...Yeti.

5078
03:43:57,210 --> 03:43:58,130
Or is he...

5079
03:43:58,130 --> 03:43:58,270
Oh?

5080
03:44:04,010 --> 03:44:05,090
What's going on?

5081
03:44:06,610 --> 03:44:08,270
He's gonna kill him out of greed!

5082
03:44:08,950 --> 03:44:09,350
Oh!

5083
03:44:15,560 --> 03:44:16,660
Out of greed!

5084
03:44:24,990 --> 03:44:26,430
What the fuck?

5085
03:44:30,590 --> 03:44:31,750
The corruption...

5086
03:44:31,750 --> 03:44:31,950
No!

5087
03:44:36,130 --> 03:44:37,390
Oh, my God!

5088
03:44:37,390 --> 03:44:37,790
I said...

5089
03:44:37,790 --> 03:44:38,090
Oh!

5090
03:44:38,410 --> 03:44:38,990
Oh, my God!

5091
03:44:40,750 --> 03:44:41,350
No!

5092
03:44:41,470 --> 03:44:41,650
No!

5093
03:44:41,650 --> 03:44:42,450
He's gonna die.

5094
03:44:45,590 --> 03:44:47,250
What the fuck!

5095
03:44:52,990 --> 03:44:55,510
And then they lost their unlimited money.

5096
03:44:58,270 --> 03:44:59,590
That's so fucked.

5097
03:45:09,330 --> 03:45:10,770
Yeah, like how do you...

5098
03:45:10,770 --> 03:45:13,530
Of course, they lost their unlimited source of money.

5099
03:45:15,870 --> 03:45:17,350
How could they like...

5100
03:45:20,190 --> 03:45:22,470
Oh my god.

5101
03:45:30,280 --> 03:45:37,370
For your life?

5102
03:45:57,080 --> 03:45:57,560
It's so funny.

5103
03:45:59,260 --> 03:45:59,780
It's so funny.

5104
03:46:01,340 --> 03:46:02,160
It's so sad.

5105
03:46:10,440 --> 03:46:11,760
Yeah, isn't that Xifu?

5106
03:46:12,220 --> 03:46:13,220
Yeah, I was gonna say.

5107
03:46:14,220 --> 03:46:15,000
That's Xifu.

5108
03:46:22,910 --> 03:46:25,410
Oh, so he was trying to prove, like, a point.

5109
03:46:25,990 --> 03:46:26,430
That...

5110
03:46:28,290 --> 03:46:30,050
That, like, humans will always be greedy.

5111
03:46:38,630 --> 03:46:39,310
Yeah.

5112
03:46:53,830 --> 03:46:55,550
Well, that was Yellow Brow?

5113
03:47:00,150 --> 03:47:03,670
Okay, so, like, why couldn't I hit the Buddhas?

5114
03:47:04,530 --> 03:47:06,250
Were you gaslighting me?

5115
03:47:11,010 --> 03:47:11,850
Did you?

5116
03:47:11,870 --> 03:47:12,250
Were you?

5117
03:47:12,270 --> 03:47:13,230
You guys, you fuckers.

5118
03:47:13,270 --> 03:47:14,130
You fucking...

5119
03:47:14,130 --> 03:47:14,870
You fucking...

5120
03:47:14,870 --> 03:47:16,870
I fucking knew it.

5121
03:47:16,890 --> 03:47:20,450
I fucking knew you guys were fucking gaslighting me.

5122
03:47:24,070 --> 03:47:25,390
Oh my god.

5123
03:47:25,770 --> 03:47:26,890
That's so fucked.

5124
03:47:28,330 --> 03:47:29,890
That's so fucked.

5125
03:47:29,910 --> 03:47:30,950
I purposely lost.

5126
03:47:31,330 --> 03:47:35,010
I purposely died because I was like, Oh no, I fucking killed them.

5127
03:47:35,010 --> 03:47:36,150
Maybe I'll reset it.

5128
03:47:36,170 --> 03:47:37,710
Maybe I'll just reset it.

5129
03:47:39,370 --> 03:47:41,010
You fuckers.

5130
03:47:41,090 --> 03:47:42,270
You fuckers.

5131
03:47:42,270 --> 03:47:42,870
Okay, let's see.

5132
03:47:43,250 --> 03:47:44,910
Oh, there's Normal Baby.

5133
03:47:46,730 --> 03:47:48,510
Oh, there's Normal Baby.

5134
03:47:48,870 --> 03:47:53,990
Oh, there's Normal Baby.

5135
03:47:56,430 --> 03:47:57,890
I'm not... Okay.

5136
03:47:58,690 --> 03:47:59,890
I'm not...

5137
03:47:59,890 --> 03:47:59,890
Okay.

5138
03:47:59,990 --> 03:48:02,370
I'm not...

5139
03:48:02,370 --> 03:48:02,370
Okay.

5140
03:48:02,490 --> 03:48:06,150
I'm not... Okay.

5141
03:48:09,910 --> 03:48:11,590
We learned from the best.

5142
03:48:11,950 --> 03:48:13,190
JL, thank you for the superchat.

5143
03:48:13,250 --> 03:48:13,450
Thank you.

5144
03:48:13,770 --> 03:48:14,070
Thank you.

5145
03:48:17,290 --> 03:48:18,150
Thank you.

5146
03:48:19,690 --> 03:48:20,470
Thank you.

5147
03:48:23,630 --> 03:48:24,150
Thank you.

5148
03:48:24,150 --> 03:48:24,770
Oh my god.

5149
03:48:25,110 --> 03:48:27,030
We finally did it.

5150
03:48:27,210 --> 03:48:28,250
Oh, hey, there's more.

5151
03:48:28,390 --> 03:48:29,110
Oh, there's these guys.

5152
03:48:29,210 --> 03:48:30,110
Oh, there's Tiger Boy.

5153
03:48:30,450 --> 03:48:30,970
Oh,

5154
03:48:36,110 --> 03:48:36,130
there's these guys.

5155
03:48:36,130 --> 03:48:36,130
Oh, there's Tiger Boy.

5156
03:48:36,130 --> 03:48:36,550
Oh, a gong?

5157
03:48:36,750 --> 03:48:38,030
Yeah.

5158
03:48:45,570 --> 03:48:49,030
Yeah, that's the zodiacs.

5159
03:49:08,770 --> 03:49:10,210
Oh yeah, the snake general.

5160
03:49:10,430 --> 03:49:11,290
His roommate's dead.

5161
03:49:12,030 --> 03:49:13,370
The turtle's roommate's dead.

5162
03:49:14,170 --> 03:49:15,250
What about this guy?

5163
03:49:15,470 --> 03:49:16,090
Who's this guy?

5164
03:49:26,570 --> 03:49:29,670
Oh, is that the flying, deaf, and crazy guy?

5165
03:49:31,690 --> 03:49:32,610
Oh, it is!

5166
03:49:38,650 --> 03:49:39,730
Flying, deaf, and crazy.

5167
03:49:41,590 --> 03:49:42,310
That's me.

5168
03:49:42,530 --> 03:49:43,210
That's me.

5169
03:49:44,910 --> 03:49:46,310
That's everybody, right?

5170
03:49:49,630 --> 03:49:50,170
Everybody?

5171
03:49:50,490 --> 03:49:51,510
Alright, next chapter.

5172
03:49:53,850 --> 03:49:54,390
Yes.

5173
03:49:54,670 --> 03:49:56,650
I wanna know what the next chapter's gonna be like.

5174
03:49:57,270 --> 03:49:59,790
Then maybe we'll fight Tommy the Tiger.

5175
03:50:00,330 --> 03:50:00,870
Maybe.

5176
03:50:01,370 --> 03:50:03,730
We'll see how I feel after this.

5177
03:50:03,990 --> 03:50:07,630
After chapter... after intro of chapter four.

5178
03:50:07,690 --> 03:50:08,630
We'll see how I feel.

5179
03:50:08,650 --> 03:50:08,730
We'll see how I feel.

5180
03:50:22,800 --> 03:50:23,480
Huh?

5181
03:50:27,480 --> 03:50:28,160
Hurry up.

5182
03:50:30,160 --> 03:50:30,340
Hurry up.

5183
03:50:32,220 --> 03:50:34,660
Oh my god, who's... what is that?

5184
03:50:36,040 --> 03:50:36,380
Woah!

5185
03:50:38,800 --> 03:50:39,480
Woah!

5186
03:50:41,060 --> 03:50:42,240
That's gonna be me?

5187
03:50:52,160 --> 03:50:53,740
I'm still in your dreams.

5188
03:50:55,420 --> 03:50:55,940
I'm still in your dreams.

5189
03:50:57,080 --> 03:50:58,220
Wanna see what happened.

5190
03:50:58,440 --> 03:50:59,620
I'm still in your dreams too.

5191
03:51:01,160 --> 03:51:01,700
Woah.

5192
03:51:08,260 --> 03:51:10,360
I'm in your dreams too.

5193
03:51:10,540 --> 03:51:10,820
Alright, we're getting ready.

5194
03:51:10,820 --> 03:51:11,880
We're gonna finish this.

5195
03:51:12,500 --> 03:51:13,640
A quick sneak peek.

5196
03:51:13,640 --> 03:51:14,300
I'm not gonna lie to you anymore.

5197
03:51:14,300 --> 03:51:16,080
I'm very skilled at doing this.

5198
03:51:16,180 --> 03:51:16,360
I've been doing this for a very long time.

5199
03:51:16,560 --> 03:51:17,260
Okay, let's just do this.

5200
03:51:17,260 --> 03:51:17,720
Bye.

5201
03:51:17,720 --> 03:51:18,160
I'll see you next time.

5202
03:51:18,440 --> 03:51:18,820
See ya.

5203
03:51:18,820 --> 03:51:18,900
What?

5204
03:51:22,960 --> 03:51:23,600
What's that?

5205
03:51:26,780 --> 03:51:27,880
I'm trying to... what?

5206
03:51:30,840 --> 03:51:32,860
Oh, she's joining me in the journey?

5207
03:51:33,040 --> 03:51:33,700
He's still there?

5208
03:51:36,520 --> 03:51:37,900
Oh, I thought it was...

5209
03:51:37,900 --> 03:51:39,340
I thought it was Wukong in there.

5210
03:51:52,900 --> 03:51:54,360
Wukong, come down and talk to me.

5211
03:52:00,960 --> 03:52:02,000
He's gone.

5212
03:52:02,620 --> 03:52:04,420
Oh, he was with me!

5213
03:52:06,200 --> 03:52:08,600
I was like, what the fuck?

5214
03:52:09,460 --> 03:52:10,840
Okay, he was with me.

5215
03:52:10,920 --> 03:52:11,220
Okay.

5216
03:52:12,000 --> 03:52:12,600
Alright.

5217
03:52:12,900 --> 03:52:14,160
I was like...

5218
03:52:14,160 --> 03:52:14,780
Oh, I thought...

5219
03:52:14,780 --> 03:52:16,740
I was like, where the fuck is Wukong?

5220
03:52:18,680 --> 03:52:20,060
Okay, where's the incense?

5221
03:52:21,440 --> 03:52:22,040
Like...

5222
03:52:22,900 --> 03:52:23,200
Where am I?

5223
03:52:23,700 --> 03:52:25,240
Okay, at least it's trees now.

5224
03:52:25,380 --> 03:52:26,120
It's no more snow.

5225
03:52:30,140 --> 03:52:31,440
Is that the hag?

5226
03:52:33,900 --> 03:52:34,620
Is that her?

5227
03:52:35,640 --> 03:52:36,940
Wait, where's the incense?

5228
03:52:40,650 --> 03:52:41,570
What the fuck?

5229
03:52:42,770 --> 03:52:45,110
Okay, I guess I'll just grab some materials then.

5230
03:52:45,170 --> 03:52:45,570
For now.

5231
03:52:55,410 --> 03:52:57,330
Give me a sec, Pigsy.

5232
03:52:57,530 --> 03:52:58,190
I'm trying to...

5233
03:52:58,190 --> 03:52:59,310
What is he doing?

5234
03:53:00,170 --> 03:53:01,170
I'm trying to loot.

5235
03:53:05,730 --> 03:53:06,870
I'm trying to loot.

5236
03:53:06,930 --> 03:53:07,630
Loot is important.

5237
03:53:09,030 --> 03:53:10,090
Wait, what's up here?

5238
03:53:13,510 --> 03:53:14,430
What's up here?

5239
03:53:17,790 --> 03:53:18,290
Absorb.

5240
03:53:19,650 --> 03:53:20,760
Okay, we gotta find...

5241
03:53:20,760 --> 03:53:27,980
We have to find... we have to find the incense area so we can head, uh, we can save our game.

5242
03:53:29,560 --> 03:53:30,680
Oh hey, mushroom.

5243
03:53:32,040 --> 03:53:32,600
Nice.

5244
03:53:33,620 --> 03:53:34,900
Mushroom that I'll never use.

5245
03:53:36,000 --> 03:53:37,640
All right, let's see.

5246
03:53:37,780 --> 03:53:38,520
Let's go this way.

5247
03:53:41,000 --> 03:53:41,820
All right.

5248
03:53:43,600 --> 03:53:44,880
Go this way.

5249
03:53:48,240 --> 03:53:49,540
The shrine is inside?

5250
03:53:50,280 --> 03:53:53,280
Like, deeper into the area?

5251
03:53:53,380 --> 03:53:53,740
Like here?

5252
03:53:56,400 --> 03:53:57,520
I assume it's there.

5253
03:53:57,560 --> 03:53:58,900
That's like literally the only way to go.

5254
03:53:59,020 --> 03:53:59,920
Wait, what's that up there?

5255
03:54:00,020 --> 03:54:00,520
You see that?

5256
03:54:01,000 --> 03:54:01,940
Is that an enemy?

5257
03:54:02,840 --> 03:54:03,800
Oh yeah, it is.

5258
03:54:04,960 --> 03:54:06,460
It's like, what's that hang up there?

5259
03:54:06,980 --> 03:54:07,380
Hello!

5260
03:54:09,220 --> 03:54:10,100
The village.

5261
03:54:17,500 --> 03:54:18,360
What is he?

5262
03:54:18,480 --> 03:54:19,300
What is that?

5263
03:54:19,940 --> 03:54:21,520
What the fuck is that?

5264
03:54:21,560 --> 03:54:22,180
Is that Spider?

5265
03:54:22,980 --> 03:54:24,500
Oh shit, it is.

5266
03:54:25,240 --> 03:54:26,500
Bro he's so ugly!

5267
03:54:27,120 --> 03:54:28,440
Bro, what the fuck?

5268
03:54:30,100 --> 03:54:32,220
You can't just call him ugly like that.

5269
03:54:32,320 --> 03:54:34,240
Well like, tough love.

5270
03:54:38,360 --> 03:54:40,660
Like, I'm not gonna lie to him.

5271
03:54:42,740 --> 03:54:43,820
I'm not gonna lie.

5272
03:54:45,600 --> 03:54:47,180
So many like...

5273
03:54:47,180 --> 03:54:47,980
Oh, there's another one.

5274
03:54:49,960 --> 03:54:51,280
There's so many spiders.

5275
03:54:53,080 --> 03:54:53,900
Hell yeah.

5276
03:54:55,480 --> 03:54:56,100
Alright.

5277
03:55:02,750 --> 03:55:04,170
Alright, off we go.

5278
03:55:05,110 --> 03:55:07,130
Oh, there's flies now too?

5279
03:55:07,970 --> 03:55:09,150
What the fuck?

5280
03:55:09,610 --> 03:55:11,050
I thought it was a...

5281
03:55:11,050 --> 03:55:12,150
Oh shit.

5282
03:55:12,410 --> 03:55:14,170
Wait, you're not a spider?

5283
03:55:15,270 --> 03:55:16,470
Wait, what the fuck?

5284
03:55:16,490 --> 03:55:17,170
You're not a...

5285
03:55:17,830 --> 03:55:18,910
Wait, what are you?

5286
03:55:19,730 --> 03:55:20,890
You're not a spider.

5287
03:55:21,090 --> 03:55:21,790
You're an Oni.

5288
03:55:21,810 --> 03:55:23,370
Wait, no.

5289
03:55:23,430 --> 03:55:24,330
Oni is like Japanese.

5290
03:55:25,130 --> 03:55:26,230
Wait, what are you?

5291
03:55:28,910 --> 03:55:29,750
There's a lantern.

5292
03:55:29,970 --> 03:55:31,150
Okay, he's just holding...

5293
03:55:31,150 --> 03:55:32,130
Okay.

5294
03:55:33,710 --> 03:55:35,530
I was like, what are you?

5295
03:55:35,550 --> 03:55:37,410
He just holds the lantern, guys.

5296
03:55:37,790 --> 03:55:38,770
He's just...

5297
03:55:40,190 --> 03:55:40,710
Okay.

5298
03:55:42,130 --> 03:55:44,970
He's just there to hold the lantern, I guess.

5299
03:55:47,590 --> 03:55:48,770
I guess that...

5300
03:55:48,770 --> 03:55:50,170
He's just...

5301
03:55:50,170 --> 03:55:51,390
I guess that's his name.

5302
03:55:52,390 --> 03:55:54,610
Doesn't even have an actual real name.

5303
03:55:54,830 --> 03:55:55,690
He's just...

5304
03:55:55,690 --> 03:55:56,910
Lantern holding.

5305
03:55:57,750 --> 03:56:00,770
Oh yeah, he's illuminating the path for all the other guys.

5306
03:56:02,010 --> 03:56:03,830
He's just an employee.

5307
03:56:04,410 --> 03:56:05,850
He's a street light.

5308
03:56:07,010 --> 03:56:08,010
Oh, what are you?

5309
03:56:10,590 --> 03:56:11,550
Is he a mouse?

5310
03:56:11,770 --> 03:56:12,930
Are you a cockroach?

5311
03:56:13,590 --> 03:56:14,550
What are you?

5312
03:56:17,290 --> 03:56:18,190
You know what?

5313
03:56:18,410 --> 03:56:19,110
Fuck it.

5314
03:56:19,310 --> 03:56:19,850
Let's go.

5315
03:56:20,250 --> 03:56:21,210
I might as well.

5316
03:56:21,890 --> 03:56:22,750
Oh, shit.

5317
03:56:23,330 --> 03:56:23,810
Okay.

5318
03:56:24,010 --> 03:56:24,970
Don't worry, I got this.

5319
03:56:26,210 --> 03:56:26,690
Boom!

5320
03:56:26,870 --> 03:56:27,830
That's fucking right.

5321
03:56:28,510 --> 03:56:29,990
I think he's a cockroach.

5322
03:56:31,710 --> 03:56:32,930
Let's see, what are you?

5323
03:56:34,050 --> 03:56:35,510
He is a beetle captain!

5324
03:56:35,770 --> 03:56:36,770
I was very wrong!

5325
03:56:37,350 --> 03:56:37,830
Alright.

5326
03:56:40,670 --> 03:56:42,430
He's just a beetle captain.

5327
03:56:42,630 --> 03:56:43,510
Oh my god.

5328
03:56:43,630 --> 03:56:44,450
Get me out of here.

5329
03:56:46,070 --> 03:56:46,550
Poke!

5330
03:56:48,190 --> 03:56:48,670
Alright.

5331
03:56:50,110 --> 03:56:52,030
Like, at least he has a name, you know?

5332
03:56:52,270 --> 03:56:53,150
Like, he has a job.

5333
03:56:53,290 --> 03:56:54,370
Like, he has a captain.

5334
03:56:54,710 --> 03:56:55,850
And he's like...

5335
03:56:55,850 --> 03:56:57,070
It tells you what he is.

5336
03:56:57,290 --> 03:56:59,770
That guy just fucking holds lanterns.

5337
03:57:00,070 --> 03:57:00,730
There you go.

5338
03:57:00,810 --> 03:57:01,430
Poor man.

5339
03:57:05,990 --> 03:57:07,510
You're warning if you hate bugs.

5340
03:57:07,850 --> 03:57:08,610
Yeah, this isn't...

5341
03:57:08,610 --> 03:57:09,390
This is bug...

5342
03:57:09,390 --> 03:57:10,910
This is bug county right here.

5343
03:57:11,210 --> 03:57:11,690
Okay.

5344
03:57:12,750 --> 03:57:13,230
Okay.

5345
03:57:13,410 --> 03:57:13,890
Okay.

5346
03:57:13,950 --> 03:57:14,430
Okay.

5347
03:57:14,430 --> 03:57:14,510
This is bug county.

5348
03:57:15,610 --> 03:57:16,130
Abzor.

5349
03:57:18,850 --> 03:57:19,370
Alright.

5350
03:57:22,890 --> 03:57:23,930
Mail number!

5351
03:57:24,070 --> 03:57:25,390
It's like in gacha games.

5352
03:57:25,610 --> 03:57:27,090
What was that gacha game?

5353
03:57:27,310 --> 03:57:29,270
There was a gacha game that's...

5354
03:57:29,270 --> 03:57:32,150
That's literally like, has like three mail characters.

5355
03:57:32,410 --> 03:57:34,450
And one of them doesn't even have a name.

5356
03:57:34,670 --> 03:57:35,350
I don't remember.

5357
03:57:36,010 --> 03:57:37,430
I'm trying to remember!

5358
03:57:38,830 --> 03:57:39,630
I don't remember...

5359
03:57:39,630 --> 03:57:41,570
I don't remember which gacha game that was.

5360
03:57:45,900 --> 03:57:46,420
That's...

5361
03:57:46,420 --> 03:57:46,740
I'm going to try to remember.

5362
03:57:46,740 --> 03:57:47,360
What was that?

5363
03:57:48,520 --> 03:57:56,700
There's like a wikipedia page of the characters in this gacha game.

5364
03:57:56,880 --> 03:57:59,160
And literally the male characters is just like...

5365
03:57:59,460 --> 03:58:03,160
One is like male unnamed male or some shit.

5366
03:58:03,520 --> 03:58:05,200
I was like damn that's fucking rough.

5367
03:58:06,080 --> 03:58:07,500
That's fucking rough.

5368
03:58:09,580 --> 03:58:10,940
Wait he dodged that?

5369
03:58:11,120 --> 03:58:11,340
How?

5370
03:58:13,280 --> 03:58:15,420
That's way too big.

5371
03:58:18,400 --> 03:58:19,400
Oh is that a shrine?

5372
03:58:19,800 --> 03:58:21,740
Bro where the fuck am I?

5373
03:58:24,500 --> 03:58:26,360
Where the fuck is the shrine?

5374
03:58:26,800 --> 03:58:27,960
All I see is the light.

5375
03:58:28,100 --> 03:58:29,440
Oh my god.

5376
03:58:29,480 --> 03:58:30,960
All I see is the employees.

5377
03:58:32,480 --> 03:58:34,720
That's just trying to fucking hold the light.

5378
03:58:39,860 --> 03:58:41,100
Get out of here.

5379
03:58:41,280 --> 03:58:42,860
Get out of my fucking video game.

5380
03:58:43,960 --> 03:58:44,440
Poke.

5381
03:58:44,860 --> 03:58:45,340
Alright.

5382
03:58:45,700 --> 03:58:47,060
Oh wait that's poison.

5383
03:58:48,860 --> 03:58:49,340
Okay.

5384
03:58:50,020 --> 03:58:51,140

5388
03:58:55,520 --> 03:58:56,660
That's not true Garrett.

5389
03:58:56,800 --> 03:58:58,040

You're a great streamer.

5395
03:59:06,100 --> 03:59:09,580
I'm not normally watching vtubers but I found your channel.

5396
03:59:09,920 --> 03:59:11,420
You deserve all the praise.

5397

03:59:19,700 --> 03:59:21,320
How does she know?

5401
03:59:22,620 --> 03:59:24,920
Youtube snitched on you Garrett.

5402
03:59:25,180 --> 03:59:25,800

5403
03:59:26,060 --> 03:59:28,260
He got snitched on.

5404
03:59:33,840 --> 03:59:37,740
I like how other chatters are like I saw you here before.

5405
03:59:38,660 --> 03:59:39,660
That's fun.

5406
03:59:39,660 --> 03:59:40,040
Fuck.

5407
03:59:40,600 --> 03:59:42,480
That's actually fucked.

5408
03:59:42,560 --> 03:59:43,820
Alright let's put this on.

5409
03:59:44,580 --> 03:59:45,480

03:59:52,980 --> 03:59:55,620
I don't have fine gold thread?

5415
03:59:56,200 --> 03:59:57,520
How the fuck do I?

5416
03:59:57,660 --> 03:59:58,780

5417
03:59:59,640 --> 04:00:00,580
Okay buy.

5421
04:00:05,300 --> 04:00:07,000
I can sell all my shit.

5422
04:00:07,060 --> 04:00:09,240
I have like so much shit I didn't sell.

5423
04:00:09,400 --> 04:00:09,640
I can sell all my shit.

5424
04:00:09,640 --> 04:00:09,640

5425
04:00:09,640 --> 04:00:10,980
Alright nice.

04:00:16,260 --> 04:00:17,380
There we go.

5428
04:00:18,660 --> 04:00:19,300
Nice.

5429
04:00:20,920 --> 04:00:22,760
Oh my god I'm fucking rich.

5430
04:00:22,840 --> 04:00:23,420
Look at me.

5431
04:00:24,220 --> 04:00:25,960
Now I have chill resistance.

5432
04:00:26,320 --> 04:00:26,960
Finally.

5433
04:00:27,580 --> 04:00:28,220
Alright.

5434
04:00:30,340 --> 04:00:30,980
Alright.

5435
04:00:31,460 --> 04:00:32,480
We're gonna rest.

5436
04:00:33,140 --> 04:00:36,840
And then we're gonna do the stupid tiger man.

5437
04:00:36,840 --> 04:00:38,740
Come on.

5438
04:00:41,650 --> 04:00:42,840
We're gonna do it.

5439
04:00:45,420 --> 04:00:49,000
That set bonus is anti melee.

5440
04:00:51,360 --> 04:00:52,820
Oh my god.

5441
04:00:53,360 --> 04:00:54,580
It's fine.

5442
04:01:01,690 --> 04:01:02,400
It's fine.

5443
04:01:03,080 --> 04:01:04,300
It's fine.

5444
04:01:05,140 --> 04:01:06,080
It's fine.

5445
04:01:06,080 --> 04:01:07,880
Don't give me anti chill when I'm like there.

5446
04:01:08,120 --> 04:01:08,540
You know?

5447
04:01:09,360 --> 04:01:10,940
Okay let's make sure.

5448
04:01:11,100 --> 04:01:11,880
Let's just make sure.

5449
04:01:12,360 --> 04:01:13,600
What was it?

5450
04:01:13,640 --> 04:01:14,320
Visual effect.

5451
04:01:14,780 --> 04:01:16,920
Let's put visual effect on low.

5452
04:01:17,120 --> 04:01:18,760
Because that shit killed my PC.

5453
04:01:19,020 --> 04:01:21,300
And it never fixed itself after that.

5454
04:01:22,580 --> 04:01:23,920
Was it visual effect?

5455
04:01:24,340 --> 04:01:25,760
It was visual effect right?

5456
04:01:26,560 --> 04:01:29,040
Or was it post effect quality?

5457
04:01:29,440 --> 04:01:29,820
Was it?

5458
04:01:29,940 --> 04:01:31,120
I don't remember.

5459
04:01:34,580 --> 04:01:35,380
Was it?

5460
04:01:35,400 --> 04:01:35,900
Um.

5461
04:01:37,120 --> 04:01:39,840
Is it post effect or just visual effect?

5462
04:01:42,340 --> 04:01:43,020
Both?

5463
04:01:43,280 --> 04:01:43,560
Okay.

5464
04:01:45,140 --> 04:01:47,120
I'm not risking it.

5465
04:01:47,280 --> 04:01:48,100
Like this tiger.

5466
04:01:48,240 --> 04:01:49,720
This tiger fucked me up.

5467
04:01:49,900 --> 04:01:50,740
This tiger.

5468
04:01:51,440 --> 04:01:52,680
Oh my god.

5469
04:01:53,040 --> 04:01:55,120
Oh it's this area.

5470
04:01:55,360 --> 04:01:57,120
Oh my god.

5471
04:01:57,360 --> 04:01:59,360
It's this area.

5472
04:01:59,620 --> 04:02:00,860
Oh my god.

5473
04:02:02,060 --> 04:02:03,840
It's not even.

5474
04:02:04,060 --> 04:02:05,280
It's this area.

5475
04:02:05,280 --> 04:02:07,900
It's actually this area.

5476
04:02:08,440 --> 04:02:10,360
Holy shit.

5477
04:02:10,720 --> 04:02:12,380
Oh my god bro.

5478
04:02:12,420 --> 04:02:14,780
Tiger gets all lows dude.

5479
04:02:14,960 --> 04:02:15,180
Fuck.

5480
04:02:17,320 --> 04:02:20,060
This is all lows.

5481
04:02:20,120 --> 04:02:21,460
Tiger gets all lows.

5482
04:02:21,520 --> 04:02:22,440
Like I can't.

5483
04:02:22,860 --> 04:02:24,680
Like oh my god.

5484
04:02:24,700 --> 04:02:25,480
I can't.

5485
04:02:25,600 --> 04:02:26,380
I have.

5486
04:02:26,740 --> 04:02:28,520
He doesn't deserve.

5487
04:02:28,960 --> 04:02:30,240
He doesn't deserve.

5488
04:02:32,420 --> 04:02:33,600
He doesn't deserve.

5489
04:02:34,220 --> 04:02:35,240
He doesn't deserve.

5490
04:02:35,240 --> 04:02:35,260
He doesn't deserve.

5491
04:02:35,260 --> 04:02:36,680
He doesn't deserve better quality.

5492
04:02:36,800 --> 04:02:37,960
Oh my god.

5493
04:02:38,020 --> 04:02:39,400
Look how low quality.

5494
04:02:40,860 --> 04:02:43,560
This area is so fucked.

5495
04:02:44,120 --> 04:02:46,120
I can't the game quality.

5496
04:02:46,380 --> 04:02:47,240
Holy shit.

5497
04:02:47,560 --> 04:02:50,440
Oh my god.

5498
04:02:50,460 --> 04:02:53,160
The game quality is actually crazy.

5499
04:02:53,980 --> 04:02:56,780
Oh my god.

5500
04:02:58,100 --> 04:02:59,720
Oh my god.

5501
04:03:00,480 --> 04:03:02,840
Literally is this area.

5502
04:03:05,860 --> 04:03:07,060
Oh shit.

5503
04:03:08,440 --> 04:03:09,040
Okay.

5504
04:03:10,060 --> 04:03:10,660
Okay.

5505
04:03:13,000 --> 04:03:13,600
Okay.

5506
04:03:14,380 --> 04:03:19,680
Oh my god.

5507
04:03:19,740 --> 04:03:20,920
That was a big slap.

5508
04:03:21,340 --> 04:03:22,500
Come on, get over here.

5509
04:03:22,500 --> 04:03:26,180
Let's fucking... No way!

5510
04:03:26,340 --> 04:03:32,060
You fucking... Oh my god.

5511
04:03:32,880 --> 04:03:35,040
Wukong mobile.

5512
04:03:35,320 --> 04:03:38,060
This is Wukong mobile right now.

5513
04:03:39,660 --> 04:03:40,980
Where did he go?

5514
04:03:41,040 --> 04:03:41,780
What?!

5515
04:03:41,780 --> 04:03:44,100
Okay, that's bullshit.

5516
04:03:44,560 --> 04:03:46,680
That's actually bullshit.

5517
04:03:47,620 --> 04:03:49,720
Oh my god!

5518
04:03:49,780 --> 04:03:52,260
He fucking... I'm off my groove!

5519
04:03:57,360 --> 04:03:58,940
Oh my god.

5520
04:03:59,020 --> 04:03:59,940
I'm off my groove.

5521
04:04:00,080 --> 04:04:01,000
I'm off my groove.

5522
04:04:01,120 --> 04:04:02,660
I'm off my groove now.

5523
04:04:03,420 --> 04:04:04,640
I'm off my groove!

5524
04:04:08,260 --> 04:04:11,100
Shit, I hate him so much.

5525
04:04:12,240 --> 04:04:13,580
Oh my god.

5526
04:04:14,000 --> 04:04:15,360
He's so annoying.

5527
04:04:15,560 --> 04:04:16,740
He's so annoying!

5528
04:04:20,060 --> 04:04:20,660
Okay.

5529
04:04:23,560 --> 04:04:24,160
Wukong!

5530
04:04:26,260 --> 04:04:28,040
I don't know his patterns!

5531
04:04:28,920 --> 04:04:29,520
Okay.

5532
04:04:31,260 --> 04:04:32,460
Oh shit!

5533
04:04:35,480 --> 04:04:36,080
Okay.

5534
04:04:36,080 --> 04:04:38,380
I don't have a lot of heals now.

5535
04:04:39,380 --> 04:04:39,980
Okay.

5536
04:04:41,220 --> 04:04:43,340
My groove got so ruined.

5537
04:04:45,940 --> 04:04:46,700
Oh my god.

5538
04:04:46,720 --> 04:04:48,580
My whole timing was off too.

5539
04:04:48,660 --> 04:04:49,660
That's the worst part.

5540
04:04:50,900 --> 04:04:51,500
No!

5541
04:04:51,800 --> 04:04:52,100
Oh!

5542
04:04:52,840 --> 04:04:53,900
Oh god, no!

5543
04:04:55,940 --> 04:04:56,580
Okay.

5544
04:04:57,640 --> 04:05:00,020
Oh, you serious?!

5545
04:05:00,020 --> 04:05:02,500
My attack didn't hit first?!

5546
04:05:02,500 --> 04:05:03,480
That's fucked.

5547
04:05:03,940 --> 04:05:05,800
My attack should have hit first there.

5548
04:05:20,010 --> 04:05:22,570
Are you fucking...

5549
04:05:23,370 --> 04:05:24,590
Wait, did I do it?

5550
04:05:24,910 --> 04:05:26,510
Wait, I killed him?!

5551
04:05:26,510 --> 04:05:28,130
I skipped it!

5552
04:05:28,210 --> 04:05:29,830
I skipped it, guys!

5553
04:05:50,580 --> 04:05:52,780
I thought I lost!

5554
04:05:53,360 --> 04:05:56,060
Oh my god!

5555
04:05:56,760 --> 04:05:57,820
Bro!

5556
04:05:58,080 --> 04:05:59,700
The second...

5557
04:05:59,930 --> 04:06:01,080
Oh shit!

5558
04:06:01,280 --> 04:06:02,240
Hey!

5559
04:06:03,910 --> 04:06:05,820
Oh my god!

5560
04:06:05,820 --> 04:06:08,060
What the fuck is he equipped for, Kyrios?

5561
04:06:09,640 --> 04:06:12,320
Oh my god!

5562
04:06:12,500 --> 04:06:13,280
Oh my god!

5563
04:06:13,280 --> 04:06:13,520
Oh my god!

5564
04:06:13,520 --> 04:06:14,220
Low quality.

5565
04:06:14,680 --> 04:06:15,500
Okay.

5566
04:06:15,500 --> 04:06:15,760
Okay.

5567
04:06:16,540 --> 04:06:18,160
Oh my god.

5568
04:06:18,220 --> 04:06:19,740
I literally thought I lost.

5569
04:06:19,940 --> 04:06:22,300
I actually thought I lost.

5570
04:06:22,820 --> 04:06:24,260
Oh my god.

5571
04:06:24,860 --> 04:06:26,260
Oh thank god.

5572
04:06:26,560 --> 04:06:29,020
Thank god I don't have to keep going.

5573
04:06:30,900 --> 04:06:33,940
Oh my god.

5574
04:06:33,980 --> 04:06:34,280
Okay.

5575
04:06:34,460 --> 04:06:35,660
It's this area.

5576
04:06:35,800 --> 04:06:38,820
This area is fucking so...

5577
04:06:39,380 --> 04:06:43,060
I don't know what is wrong with this area, but this area is fucked up, man.

5578
04:06:45,780 --> 04:06:46,460
Alright.

5579
04:06:47,220 --> 04:06:47,900
Alright.

5580
04:06:48,260 --> 04:06:48,820
Monkey.

5581
04:06:49,080 --> 04:06:49,900
Do I have upgrades?

5582
04:06:50,240 --> 04:06:53,600
Long quality give you emotional damage.

5583
04:06:55,600 --> 04:06:56,980
Oh my god.

5584
04:06:59,320 --> 04:07:00,160
It's over.

5585
04:07:01,080 --> 04:07:01,760
Fuck.

5586
04:07:01,840 --> 04:07:03,000
Okay, let's upgrade.

5587
04:07:03,480 --> 04:07:05,140
Alright, what do we want to upgrade?

5588
04:07:05,220 --> 04:07:06,360
We have some Moncores.

5589
04:07:06,480 --> 04:07:07,280
Talk to the dog.

5590
04:07:09,100 --> 04:07:09,780
Alright.

5591
04:07:10,520 --> 04:07:11,580
Request medicine?

5592
04:07:12,560 --> 04:07:13,140
Oh yeah!

5593
04:07:13,140 --> 04:07:14,720
Give me your shit.

5594
04:07:16,980 --> 04:07:18,400
What are you giving me?

5595
04:07:19,300 --> 04:07:19,740
Okay.

5596
04:07:20,740 --> 04:07:21,280
Alright.

5597
04:07:21,560 --> 04:07:22,700
What do we want, guys?

5598
04:07:24,900 --> 04:07:25,440
Mana?

5599
04:07:27,100 --> 04:07:28,560
Does that actually do that?

5600
04:07:31,300 --> 04:07:31,840
Mana?

5601
04:07:32,200 --> 04:07:33,560
Do we want mana or stamina?

5602
04:07:35,920 --> 04:07:36,460
Mana?

5603
04:07:36,700 --> 04:07:37,700
Okay, I can do mana.

5604
04:07:39,800 --> 04:07:41,220
Oh my god.

5605
04:07:41,280 --> 04:07:42,520
No, we don't care about the casino.

5606
04:07:42,520 --> 04:07:43,380
I think it's over.

5607
04:07:47,700 --> 04:07:49,020
We don't care.

5608
04:07:49,200 --> 04:07:50,500
It's over, guys.

5609
04:07:50,640 --> 04:07:51,440
We don't care.

5610
04:07:53,440 --> 04:07:54,640
You don't care.

5611
04:07:54,700 --> 04:07:55,520
I don't care.

5612
04:07:55,580 --> 04:07:56,900
We don't have to care.

5613
04:07:58,900 --> 04:07:59,460
Alright.

5614
04:07:59,560 --> 04:08:01,640
Do we get stamina recovery rate?

5615
04:08:01,720 --> 04:08:03,880
Or should I save for maximum stamina?

5616
04:08:08,020 --> 04:08:10,860
Actually, I'll get stamina recovery.

5617
04:08:15,980 --> 04:08:16,860
What do you get?

5618
04:08:17,020 --> 04:08:17,400
Save?

5619
04:08:18,920 --> 04:08:19,520
Okay.

5620
04:08:19,660 --> 04:08:20,540
Okay, we'll save.

5621
04:08:20,840 --> 04:08:21,180
Alright.

5622
04:08:23,080 --> 04:08:24,480
Oh my god.

5623
04:08:24,500 --> 04:08:24,700
Alright.

5624
04:08:25,280 --> 04:08:26,640
Where is the...

5625
04:08:27,380 --> 04:08:29,000
Where the fuck is the shrine?

5626
04:08:29,200 --> 04:08:29,900
There it is.

5627
04:08:35,160 --> 04:08:35,760
Okay.

5628
04:08:36,540 --> 04:08:38,620
We go travel.

5629
04:08:39,220 --> 04:08:40,100
Web Hollow.

5630
04:08:40,520 --> 04:08:42,560
Oh yeah, it's definitely a spider queen.

5631
04:08:43,100 --> 04:08:45,820
Alright, let's change the quality back up to...

5632
04:08:45,820 --> 04:08:48,140
Let's put the quality back up.

5633
04:08:48,820 --> 04:08:49,580
Okay, please.

5634
04:08:49,620 --> 04:08:50,920
You're always running out of stamina.

5635
04:08:50,920 --> 04:08:53,220
Yet here you are investing in the stamina.

5636
04:08:53,580 --> 04:08:55,920
Here you are not investing in the stamina.

5637
04:08:56,220 --> 04:08:57,380
Well, thank you for the super chat.

5638
04:08:57,460 --> 04:08:57,980
Thank you, thank you.

5639
04:08:57,980 --> 04:08:58,820
Maybe it'll be different.

5640
04:08:59,020 --> 04:08:59,660
You don't know that.

5641
04:08:59,980 --> 04:09:00,380
Maybe...

5642
04:09:02,020 --> 04:09:02,500
Maybe...

5643
04:09:03,020 --> 04:09:04,360
Maybe it'll be different.

5644
04:09:05,720 --> 04:09:08,400
It could be different, guys.

5645
04:09:10,260 --> 04:09:11,440
Alright, we'll get that.

5646
04:09:12,020 --> 04:09:14,480
And then we'll put the graphics back.

5647
04:09:14,480 --> 04:09:15,560
Okay.

5648
04:09:16,240 --> 04:09:19,460
It's like high and then shadow is medium.

5649
04:09:20,080 --> 04:09:22,860
And vegetation... Was vegetation medium?

5650
04:09:23,040 --> 04:09:23,820
I don't remember.

5651
04:09:24,120 --> 04:09:24,900
Or was it low?

5652
04:09:25,140 --> 04:09:26,020
I don't remember.

5653
04:09:26,360 --> 04:09:29,000
I actually don't remember what we put.

5654
04:09:32,220 --> 04:09:34,220
Alright, what was our settings, guys?

5655
04:09:34,320 --> 04:09:35,040
I don't remember.

5656
04:09:36,300 --> 04:09:37,320
Was it lower?

5657
04:09:37,780 --> 04:09:39,060
Veg was medium.

5658
04:09:41,140 --> 04:09:42,420
No grass.

5659
04:09:42,420 --> 04:09:43,920
No what?

5660
04:09:43,960 --> 04:09:44,660
No shadows.

5661
04:09:44,760 --> 04:09:45,200
You're right.

5662
04:09:45,300 --> 04:09:46,380
We don't fucking need shadows.

5663
04:09:47,960 --> 04:09:50,160
But like, the grass though.

5664
04:09:50,540 --> 04:09:51,600
The grass.

5665
04:09:52,380 --> 04:09:54,600
Don't you guys want good grass?

5666
04:09:55,320 --> 04:09:58,760
What about the grass?

5667
04:10:00,220 --> 04:10:01,520
Is there only chance?

5668
04:10:02,740 --> 04:10:03,420
Guys...

5669
04:10:03,420 --> 04:10:05,560
Oh my god, that's so ugly.

5670
04:10:06,100 --> 04:10:07,560
Let me...

5671
04:10:08,560 --> 04:10:11,080
Guys, but what about the grass?

5672
04:10:11,760 --> 04:10:12,640
The koosa.

5673
04:10:14,800 --> 04:10:16,400
I mean, it's still ugly.

5674
04:10:19,960 --> 04:10:24,160
Okay, I'm putting the shadows back to medium.

5675
04:10:25,880 --> 04:10:27,340
Alright, here we go.

5676
04:10:27,600 --> 04:10:29,100
I think that was what it was.

5677
04:10:29,180 --> 04:10:29,680
There we go.

5678
04:10:29,800 --> 04:10:31,140
It looks a little better now.

5679
04:10:31,500 --> 04:10:32,280
It looks...

5680
04:10:32,280 --> 04:10:34,000
It looks a little better.

5681
04:10:34,860 --> 04:10:36,320
Alright, we're gonna call it here.

5682
04:10:37,020 --> 04:10:38,880
We're gonna call it here, everybody.

5683
04:10:38,880 --> 04:10:42,000
Hey, don't trust outsiders to laugh at you.

5684
04:10:42,320 --> 04:10:44,280
Oh, I mean, we made it up.

5685
04:10:44,300 --> 04:10:47,560
We finally finished chapter three and that's all that matters to me.

5686
04:10:48,240 --> 04:10:48,760
Let's...

5687
04:10:48,760 --> 04:10:50,700
Oh my god, we finally...

5688
04:10:50,700 --> 04:10:53,700
We finally finished chapter three.

5689
04:10:54,060 --> 04:10:54,940
Let's hope...

5690
04:10:54,940 --> 04:10:56,680
Let's hope we can finish chapter...

5691
04:10:56,680 --> 04:10:58,880
Let's hope that chapter four is not as long.

5692
04:10:59,080 --> 04:11:00,100
Guys, let's...

5693
04:11:00,820 --> 04:11:01,340
Um...

5694
04:11:02,500 --> 04:11:03,840
Oh my god, let...

5695
04:11:04,720 --> 04:11:05,700
Let's hope...

5696
04:11:05,700 --> 04:11:06,840
Oh my god.

5697
04:11:07,160 --> 04:11:08,540
Oh, that was fun though.

5698
04:11:08,540 --> 04:11:09,480
I had a lot of fun.

5699
04:11:09,680 --> 04:11:10,100
I was...

5700
04:11:10,100 --> 04:11:12,440
I definitely very much enjoy Wukong.

5701
04:11:12,720 --> 04:11:15,600
So, like, I hope you guys have been enjoying Wukong as well.

5702
04:11:17,300 --> 04:11:20,280
And yeah, it's been a great time playing it.

5703
04:11:20,780 --> 04:11:25,100
I've been enjoying the story and the gameplay and the fights and everything.

5704
04:11:25,300 --> 04:11:27,860
So, I don't even know when I'll ever...

5705
04:11:27,860 --> 04:11:29,300
I hope I can finish this game soon.

5706
04:11:30,100 --> 04:11:31,920
It's a very long game.

5707
04:11:34,200 --> 04:11:37,140
But as long as I'm enjoying myself, that's all that matters.

5708
04:11:37,140 --> 04:11:37,920
Um...

5709
04:11:37,920 --> 04:11:38,480
Yeah.

5710
04:11:38,960 --> 04:11:40,200
Also, you guys didn't see.

5711
04:11:40,420 --> 04:11:41,440
You guys didn't see.

5712
04:11:42,220 --> 04:11:46,140
I announced a Bandai sponsor for their new game.

5713
04:11:46,520 --> 04:11:48,100
It's for their new game, Senuality.

5714
04:11:48,260 --> 04:11:49,300
I think that's how you pronounce it.

5715
04:11:51,080 --> 04:11:54,560
I'll be doing a stream on September 14th of the new game.

5716
04:11:54,880 --> 04:11:58,400
There's gonna be future announcements as well about it.

5717
04:11:58,480 --> 04:11:59,000
So, yeah.

5718
04:11:59,080 --> 04:11:59,920
Look forward to that.

5719
04:12:00,280 --> 04:12:01,200
Look forward to that.

5720
04:12:01,280 --> 04:12:03,080
Anyway, I'm gonna call it here.

5721
04:12:03,320 --> 04:12:03,800
I'm tired.

5722
04:12:04,100 --> 04:12:05,320
I did two streams today.

5723
04:12:05,460 --> 04:12:06,240
So, like...

5724
04:12:06,240 --> 04:12:08,220
I am gonna rest now.

5725
04:12:08,500 --> 04:12:09,900
As always, everybody.

5726
04:12:10,640 --> 04:12:11,520
Stay hydrated.

5727
04:12:11,900 --> 04:12:12,520
Posture check.

5728
04:12:12,620 --> 04:12:14,020
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

5729
04:12:14,200 --> 04:12:16,240
And if you stayed up for me, head to bed.

5730
04:12:16,420 --> 04:12:17,800
Cause you deserve it.

5731
04:12:18,200 --> 04:12:19,660
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

5732
04:12:20,480 --> 04:12:21,240
Bye, guys.

5733
04:12:21,960 --> 04:12:22,400
Bye.
