1
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,260
Where the fuck did my chat go?

2
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,020
Hello everybody!

3
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,400
Sorry, I just looked I was like, where's chat?

4
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:57,380
Why is it just a white space?

5
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:00,600
All right, don't worry It's it'll be alive.

6
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:00,940
Okay.

7
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,840
Wait, give me a sec.

8
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:02,880
We'll fix it.

9
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,760
We can always fix chat I can fix you.

10
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:12,500
You guys can't fix me, but at least I can fix you Oh my god All right.

11
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:24,280
Let's see Sorry, I just also like an hour ago just came back from the outside um so like i'm uh Why where's the game?

12
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:25,140
It's right here.

13
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:27,500
But like It's right here.

14
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:31,440
But like uh Uh, you guys always know in the beginning.

15
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:47,320
It's it's it's life update time Yeah Doki got nominated for the vtuber awards vote doki bird for vtuber of the year best fbs vtuber most dedicated fan base And best vtuber event.

16
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,340
Uh, thank you for the super chat potipo.

17
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:49,680
Thank you.

18
00:02:49,760 --> 00:03:12,340
Thank you Yes, if you guys did not know the vtuber awards pinned in my chat has just been announced the nominees um, apparently I found out that um They put a limit on uh, there was a limit on like how many people how many nominations you can get as an individual and like,

19
00:03:12,340 --> 00:04:09,700
uh, And like it's two so like my event nomination doesn't count as a as a person nomination Like I understand why I got vtuber of the year but like I was like man gamer of the year is feasible I Was like I was like looking at my competition in gamer of the year and vtuber of the year I was just like man It's there's a higher percentage To like potentially win in gamer of the year versus Versus vtuber of the year because I looked at who i'm up against in vtuber year and I was like from fighting the sack I'm almost going against the same people from the streamer awards,

20
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:11,860
and that's already really rough.

21
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:25,300
But like, no, I won't say I will win absolutely, but like, there's a higher chance for me to win for that one because like, I felt like I did a lot of gaming stuff.

22
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,640
I'm like, more gamer focused.

23
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:37,580
Yeah, so I was just like, it's scarier.

24
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:46,040
It's like, VTuber of the Year, it's a lot scarier because the competition is so much more fierce versus Gamer of the Year.

25
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:51,420
Yeah, I have a huge competition.

26
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,700
But thank you guys for nominating.

27
00:04:54,820 --> 00:05:01,800
It makes sense because then there'd be like too many people would just like, like it makes sense to limit them.

28
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:09,040
Because like, I know like a lot of other VTubers, like the most nominations they got for individual wise is like two.

29
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:15,160
Because events and like fan bases don't count apparently under the same name, which is good because you guys got nominated.

30
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,520
We're still fighting the fight.

31
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:18,740
Yes, thank you for the super chat.

32
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,080
Thank you.

33
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:19,840
Thank you.

34
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:21,740
Yeah.

35
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:27,860
So like, it's more so like it's definitely a lot.

36
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:34,080
It's definitely the competition is a lot fierce versus some of the other categories.

37
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,660
But yeah, thank you guys again.

38
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:40,620
I hope you guys at least if I don't win anything, I hope you guys win something like.

39
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:43,420
I hope.

40
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:46,420
Also like, what the fuck?

41
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:52,460
Everybody else has actual FPS clips and then they gave me a fucking.

42
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:56,060
OK, so I also got nominated for FPS of the year.

43
00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:00,080
And like literally everybody else has a real clip.

44
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:09,100
And then my clip is the one where I fucking step on a landmine and I explode.

45
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,700
Like, I didn't even get to use a gun.

46
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:16,580
You see a gun in my hand, but I didn't get a chance to fucking use it.

47
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,660
Like, what the fuck is that bullshit?

48
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,300
It's so rigged.

49
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:32,300
Actually, actually rigged.

50
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:38,160
Like, they'll click and they'll see my clip compared to everybody else's clip.

51
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,080
I thought I told you guys.

52
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:47,740
I thought I said if you're going to if I'm going to be in FPS of the year, we use the Mario Party clip.

53
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,100
What happened, guys?

54
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:53,400
I thought we were going to use the Mario Party clip.

55
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,160
I thought we all agreed.

56
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,620
I feel I feel sabotaged.

57
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,360
We haven't even got into the real thing yet.

58
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,720
I already feel like I saw it.

59
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,360
So I moved back a little bit.

60
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:14,200
The past Sturkey just died because I want to be more on the left side, I want to move more to the left.

61
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,100
Anyway, but yeah.

62
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:31,040
OK, anyway, another yeah, you know, that's just like, you know, how like in Rick and Morty, I know some of you guys might not watch Rick and Morty because like you won't understand.

63
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:33,240
It's where like people with higher intellect.

64
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:42,160
But it's like that Rick and Morty episode where you're not actually instant, but you're not teleporting.

65
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:47,560
Your past self dies while you create a new alternate self that goes forward.

66
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:51,140
So that past Sturkey that you just saw is dead.

67
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:52,640
I'm new Sturkey.

68
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:58,540
Anyway, as I was saying today, I went out because I tried to go to the doctor's today.

69
00:07:58,820 --> 00:07:59,900
I tried.

70
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:14,100
I didn't get to go to the doctor's because if you guys don't know, if you're not Canadian and you don't know this, West Coast has an insane amount.

71
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,260
West Coast has a doctor shortage.

72
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:17,740
We have doctors.

73
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:23,080
They just refuse to practice, like practice medical stuff.

74
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,400
They refuse to practice their degree.

75
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:28,020
In our in our in West Coast.

76
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:31,640
So we have.

77
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:34,980
It doesn't matter how much money you pay.

78
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:39,540
We don't have enough doctors to look after people.

79
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:52,660
So yesterday I was like, I'm going to I'm going to get this checked out like I.

80
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:58,620
I'm going to get this checked out because like I want I it's been so long.

81
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,140
I have to record stuff, but I can't because I'm coughing a lot.

82
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,720
And like, you know, I'm going to talk a lot and stream.

83
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,480
So then I called.

84
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:22,260
Let me tell you guys, I called eight different doctors around several cities like near me.

85
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:36,860
I called eight different doctors and they all were like, sorry, we're not taking any new patients, by the way, we're not taking any new patients.

86
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,820
So then I was like, fuck.

87
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:51,120
And then I was ranting to this to one of my friends and then one of my friends apparently has a mutual friend that lives in my city.

88
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:56,860
So they're like, wait, maybe we can ask them and see we could use their family doctor.

89
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,320
So then like, um.

90
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,380
I was like, good idea.

91
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:11,780
So honestly, I the only way for me to see a doctor at this point is if I go to the if I go to America, like you know what's fucked?

92
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:21,500
One of my friends recently had to go to the doctor and then they're like, you should go to the doctor to get that checked out, because like they're like, I just booked an appointment like for tomorrow.

93
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,700
I'm just like, wow, I wish I had that fucking privilege.

94
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:38,060
They're like, yeah, I literally just called and just booked a doctor for tomorrow.

95
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,800
I'm just like, holy fuck.

96
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,780
Wow, you're so privileged.

97
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,900
Just do that.

98
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:50,980
Just be able to fucking call and get an appointment for the next day.

99
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,800
This was in America.

100
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,300
Like, like he like he's American.

101
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,100
And then I was like, like, wow.

102
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:06,300
So so so like, yeah.

103
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:16,380
Anyway, so, um, so my friend called their friend to see if I could mooch off their family doctor.

104
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:26,600
And then, and then the family doctor was like, sorry, we're not taking any new patients.

105
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:35,900
Maybe you could go to the hospital, but you have to wait six hours to get seen because, you know, it's free health care.

106
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:43,920
So I was just like, I don't want to fucking sit in a public hospital for six plus hours.

107
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,900
Like, I can't.

108
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,060
I can't.

109
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:50,380
And that's like, it could be six hours.

110
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,660
It could be longer.

111
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,900
Like, it's like, I don't know how long it's going to be.

112
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:57,980
Like, it's going to be the rest of my day.

113
00:11:58,540 --> 00:11:58,840
Anyway.

114
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:01,560
So, um.

115
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:07,120
Anyway, so I was like, so today I was like, I have a plan.

116
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,480
I'm going to like, I'm going to go.

117
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:18,760
There's a like, there's technically a quote unquote emergency clinic, but that also does non-emergency stuff.

118
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:23,820
It's not the hospital, but it's like a clinic for emergency and also not in primary care.

119
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:24,680
So.

120
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:36,540
So I was like, OK, if I do, maybe I'll just walk in because you can do walk in, but like, it depends on if they are seeing people.

121
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,820
So then I was like, OK, maybe.

122
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:45,060
So I went there at like early and then I literally it was like, you know.

123
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:50,320
Two or three hours after opening, after it's supposed to be open.

124
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,980
So I went in and I was like, oh, there's not a lot of people here.

125
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,960
I was just like, there's not a lot of people here.

126
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:59,340
There might be a chance.

127
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:03,320
And then, you know, I was like, I'm here.

128
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:06,020
And they're like, what are you here for?

129
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:10,760
And I was like, oh, you know, I've been coughing for two months and it's getting worse, sort of.

130
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,460
And not really worse, but it's just not recovering.

131
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:18,020
And then she was like, sorry, we're not seeing any new walk-ins now.

132
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,000
We're like full.

133
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,820
And I was like, oh my god.

134
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,940
We could do a virtual assessment.

135
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:32,340
Just give us your number and then the nurse will call you and then we'll try to figure it out via the phone call.

136
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:36,760
And then at that point, I was like, within 24 hours.

137
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,380
And then at that point, I was like, you know what?

138
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:42,760
Like, I'm desperate.

139
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:52,520
Like, you might not be able to see what's wrong with me, but maybe I'll be able to describe it really, really well.

140
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:56,440
Like, I don't know.

141
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:01,300
I'm just like, oh, I'll just describe it really, really well.

142
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,220
So you'll know what's wrong with me.

143
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:08,420
So it's better than nothing at this point.

144
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:17,560
So within 24 hours, I'm expecting a phone call back about like a virtual assessment and then they'll see what's wrong with me.

145
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:25,110
There's no other thing, guys.

146
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:25,930
I can't.

147
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:31,130
I tried everything other than waiting at the hospital for six plus.

148
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:32,030
I can't.

149
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:33,930
I haven't hit rock bottom yet.

150
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:39,050
Like, if this virtual assessment doesn't help me, I'll hit rock bottom.

151
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:50,250
Actually, no, it's either go to America and see a doctor or go to America and see a doctor or wait in the hospital for six plus hours.

152
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:51,830
It's that or the other.

153
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:53,830
I still have no idea which one yet.

154
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:56,930
I don't know which one to choose.

155
00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:08,690
Anyway, anyway, so I was like, well, um, um, I was just like, well, since like, you know, there was like a mall nearby.

156
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:11,090
So I was just like, well, not nearby.

157
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:14,690
I was just like, well, since I'm out, I'm going to go to the mall.

158
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:20,190
I guess I was like, I'm just like, I'm outside.

159
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:22,810
I might as well head to the fucking mall.

160
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:29,310
So I just like decided to stay at the mall until I came back for stream because I was just like, you know, fuck this.

161
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:32,110
Fuck, I can't.

162
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:35,010
I was just like, I need some retail there.

163
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:36,910
Well, to be fair, I bought glasses.

164
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:41,350
Guys, I needed retail therapy, but like adult retail therapy.

165
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:49,710
And then I bought very expensive glasses because I was like, my old glasses is, um, is like really old now.

166
00:15:49,810 --> 00:16:00,710
I bought this when I still like the glasses I'm wearing right now is a pair that I wore that I used to that I bought when I still lived in Hong Kong.

167
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:03,970
And then so like, that's old, old at that point.

168
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:07,230
That's incredibly old.

169
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:08,310
And so.

170
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:14,950
So I was like, OK, so I need a I need a I need new glasses frames.

171
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:22,510
So but the thing is, um, I, um, I've always wore this.

172
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:25,370
Yes, I lived in like different parts of Asia.

173
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:29,730
But like, I also used to live in Shenzhen before it.

174
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:32,950
I mean, it like it wasn't before then.

175
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:35,090
It was like barren.

176
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:39,750
But then like as I've lived in Shenzhen, it started getting more and more like advanced.

177
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:43,790
So like skyscrapers just started cropping up later on in the years.

178
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:45,490
So it's really surreal to see.

179
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:49,490
When I used to live in Shenzhen, it was literally like barren land.

180
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:51,470
Like there's like almost nothing.

181
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:53,490
But it changed.

182
00:16:53,650 --> 00:17:00,030
So now there's like factories everywhere and like you can't see the sky anymore because there's so many lights.

183
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:04,790
Anyway, so.

184
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:12,430
Anyways, as I was saying, so I was like, the thing is.

185
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:18,550
The thing is, I always wore Lindbergh glasses frames.

186
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:20,370
So like I don't know other frames.

187
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:22,570
So I don't know anything else.

188
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:28,450
And so I don't know like what other frames to buy.

189
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:39,010
So I was like, OK, I'm going to buy Lindbergh because it's like the glasses the glasses I'm most familiar with because I've never tried anything else before.

190
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:41,170
So I really like Lindbergh.

191
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:44,090
For those who don't know the Lindbergh brand, it's the one.

192
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:48,170
It's like one of the lightest glasses frames in the world.

193
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:52,070
So like they're made of material that's like incredibly light.

194
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:55,050
So you don't feel like the weight on your face.

195
00:17:56,770 --> 00:18:06,950
So I was like, OK, so I really like those because like I don't like feeling like the weight on my face when when I'm wearing glasses.

196
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:08,610
So it feels like I'm not wearing glasses.

197
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:11,370
And oh my God, wait, is this my doctor?

198
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:15,730
Wait, wait, give me a second.

199
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:17,910
Guys, I got a call.

200
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:21,990
I'm going to make sure it's not the doctor, or it is the doctor.

201
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:57,450
OK, I'm scared.

202
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:08,070
I don't I don't know who called me.

203
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:14,050
I was like, they are like, I didn't hear the first part, but they're like, we're looking for a Buddha.

204
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:16,530
And I was like, yeah, that's me.

205
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:19,650
And they're like, oh, sorry, please disregard that.

206
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:29,120
I thought, I don't think it was my doctor.

207
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:34,380
Probably just spam.

208
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:35,540
It probably was.

209
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:40,900
They just wanted to know if the call is like a real person or not.

210
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:41,900
And then I don't know.

211
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:45,360
They marked me off as a spam or something.

212
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,660
Um, yeah.

213
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:51,120
So, yeah, they're just like, are you they're like, we're this.

214
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,800
And then are you?

215
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:00,900
OK, yeah, I'm going to get ready for some more spam calls.

216
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:01,600
Anyway.

217
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:02,120
Oh, my God.

218
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,260
They took advantage of me.

219
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,560
I was waiting for my nurse.

220
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,860
I was waiting for my doctor call.

221
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,940
Anyway, um, what was I on?

222
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:11,460
What was I talking about before?

223
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:22,790
Um, what was I talking about before, uh, before the call, uh, glasses?

224
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:24,490
Oh, yeah.

225
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:33,030
Anyway, so I bought two frames because like one is like emergency and the other one's like one is for emergency and the other like for emergency cases.

226
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:35,830
And I wanted a new style anyway.

227
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:38,510
But yeah, anyway, so they were very expensive.

228
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:42,490
I basically spent like because you need to buy lenses, too.

229
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:51,750
I didn't realize because this is the first time I bought glasses by myself without like any parental guidance.

230
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:54,210
So like, by the way, I was a very I don't know.

231
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:55,590
I told you guys a lot.

232
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:57,710
But I'm a very sheltered child.

233
00:20:57,730 --> 00:20:59,610
Like I was very, very sheltered.

234
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:04,650
So they're explaining to me about like different lenses and prescriptions and everything.

235
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:09,590
And I was just like, um, because they're like, OK, so which one did you want?

236
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:11,170
Like which one like with your prescription?

237
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:12,310
What would you like?

238
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:13,650
We're getting this or that.

239
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:15,310
Do you want the UV protection?

240
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:18,310
Do you want blue light protection and stuff like that?

241
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:21,470
And like, do you want the lenses to be like one point seven something?

242
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:23,270
And then I was like.

243
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:28,750
Um, this is my first time doing this.

244
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:33,070
My mom used to help me with all of it before.

245
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:37,270
And then they heard that.

246
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:41,490
And then they're like, we can milk money off of her.

247
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:43,350
Because that's what they did.

248
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,320
They took so much money.

249
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:03,210
Yeah.

250
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:05,410
So they're like, you need this and that.

251
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:06,730
And I was like, I don't know.

252
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:08,590
I guess I do need it.

253
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:09,810
I don't know.

254
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,310
And I was confused.

255
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:16,170
So they gave me so much information.

256
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:22,210
So anyway, so I spent a thousand dollars.

257
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:28,560
They're like, so you need an eye appointment.

258
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:34,240
You need an eye checkup to to to figure out your.

259
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:39,080
They're like, do you want to get it via your current prescription or like new prescription?

260
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,480
It's better to like check your check your current prescription.

261
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:43,780
Do a new prescription.

262
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:46,080
Because like, you know, it could be outdated.

263
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,760
And I was like, you know what?

264
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:48,440
You're right.

265
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:51,280
Maybe I should get a checkup now.

266
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:54,100
And then they're like, yeah, that's one hundred and twenty dollars.

267
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,700
And I was like, oh, OK.

268
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:08,180
I was like, OK, I guess I guess I did need an eye checkup anyway, because I thought it was like the regular way.

269
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:12,540
Because like in the past, when I did like, you know, when my parents helped me decide

270
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:26,980
if I need a new prescription, all they do is just, you know, scan your, you know, like do the eye thing.

271
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:30,500
They look into you, they do the eye thing where you look into the machine.

272
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:34,700
And then like the thing gets like less blurry and blurry.

273
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:37,200
And then you have to do the lenses like one or two, one or two.

274
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:37,860
That's it.

275
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:45,220
But I think I went with the more expensive route because they did that and then like seven other things to me.

276
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:55,820
And I was like, wait a minute, did I pay for the full service instead of the what is my prescription?

277
00:23:56,280 --> 00:24:15,200
Because I was like, wait, wait a minute, I thought I was doing two things, not seven other things regarding my eyes because they're like, OK, so after this, I had to look into this x-ray thing that scanned my eyes where it was like a graph of my eyes.

278
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,940
It was like a green light and then it flashes at you.

279
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:21,700
And then I have to look at this other thing that blew into my eye.

280
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,240
I was like, the fuck is all of this?

281
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:31,560
I was just like, I was like, I don't remember any of these in prescription.

282
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:38,900
So, um, yeah, so like, um, that's normal.

283
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:41,720
But like, it's like the full experience.

284
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:46,820
I usually when I get like new prescription, I get like the two things.

285
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:53,540
It's usually like it's the one where you look into the thing and then like the picture gets more and more sharp.

286
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:56,900
And then the other one is the is the lenses.

287
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,040
That's it.

288
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:00,320
Now I did seven other things.

289
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:04,780
So I was like, oh, my God, that's that's a lot.

290
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:16,220
I was like, oh, my God, I was not expecting so many tests.

291
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,880
Um, yeah, so, yeah.

292
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:29,040
Um, I haven't I never done those before, so I was just like, oh, my God is what experience.

293
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:35,760
Oh, she's such a girl boss.

294
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:38,020
It's such a baby at the same time.

295
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:42,340
Dragoons, we can fix Doki one glass plate at a time.

296
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:44,160
Why is she like this?

297
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,400
Thank you for the super chat.

298
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:45,760
Thank you.

299
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:46,460
Thank you.

300
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,400
Ddragon, thank you for the super chat.

301
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:48,720
Thank you.

302
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:49,300
Thank you.

303
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,260
It's a show for high IQ people.

304
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:55,840
Also, Doki gets freaking 1k scammed for getting so freaking glasses.

305
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:57,460
Thank you for the super chat.

306
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:57,820
Thank you.

307
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:58,460
Thank you.

308
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:09,700
And then so like, you know, they're like, oh, yeah, I was like, oh, yeah, I want contact lenses, too, because like I like the one day disposable contacts for like emergency cases.

309
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:16,920
Because I was like, oh, I'm getting new prescriptions, I might as well get new new.

310
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:20,360
If I if my eyes got worse, I should get new prescriptions for these.

311
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:20,700
Right.

312
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:21,960
Like that makes sense.

313
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:27,360
And they're like, um, well, you got to come back for a contact fitting.

314
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,820
I don't know what the fuck a contact fitting was.

315
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,320
So I was like, cool.

316
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:31,840
OK.

317
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:32,720
Oh.

318
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,880
That was an extra seventy dollars.

319
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:38,640
I.

320
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:45,140
So I was just like, what the fuck is a contact fitting?

321
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,180
OK, cool.

322
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:47,640
That sounds free.

323
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,860
And she was like, OK, you got to pay seventy dollars.

324
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:52,000
And I was like, oh.

325
00:26:56,220 --> 00:27:03,060
Oh, I just thought I was going to buy it, just buy the contacts, but I didn't even get the contacts.

326
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:07,820
They're like, all right, you got to come back for an appointment for a contact fitting.

327
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,880
And I'm like, did I get an appointment?

328
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,940
So that's seventy dollars.

329
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:19,340
Plus, I guess whatever the cost is for like that appointment.

330
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:22,100
So I was just like, oh, OK.

331
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,020
So I was like, OK, that was that was my day.

332
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:32,360
Yeah, so.

333
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:51,680
Um, so yeah, that I got new pairs of glasses, but I can't pick them up right away because, oh, yeah, I I didn't know if I they wanted me to get blue light lenses, but like I I I didn't know because it was expensive.

334
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:57,740
So I went a tier below, which was UV protection.

335
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:00,020
I don't know if I fucked up.

336
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:09,060
Because like that was like the one time that was the one time I was like, maybe not.

337
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:14,880
So I went down a tier and it was UV light.

338
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,180
So UV protection.

339
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:19,040
So I was like, you know what?

340
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,480
Baby steps.

341
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:25,560
I like how people were like, you still got scammed.

342
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:29,400
Blue lights from your phone and monitor.

343
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,560
I stream as a career.

344
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,080
Wait, what do you mean it's not worth it?

345
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:38,440
But I wait, I should have got blue light.

346
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,220
I don't even go outside.

347
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,360
UV is for outside.

348
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,760
What do you mean?

349
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:47,160
Oh, my gosh, you got blue light.

350
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:57,200
I should have got blue light.

351
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,580
I stream as a career.

352
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:06,420
I don't even, I don't even go outside for the sun to hit me.

353
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:11,440
OK, anyway, so.

354
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:21,120
I sort of, I bought UV light lenses instead.

355
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:27,960
Because I went a tier below, and a tier below was UV light.

356
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:28,940
I don't know.

357
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,480
It was a tier below blue light.

358
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:39,260
Anyway, so, yeah, so that's basically I bought.

359
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:44,320
I was debating if I should get ice cream on the way, home, but it's so cold right now.

360
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:48,500
So I got like bubble waffle instead because I was like, you know what?

361
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:50,560
I spent so much money.

362
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:53,260
Well, I need, I need a stress seat.

363
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:56,060
I need a stress seat.

364
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,320
Also, the custom.

365
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:59,020
Oh, my God.

366
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:01,240
The fucking Apex custom.

367
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:04,380
Every day I scream into the void.

368
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:19,300
After, if I like start typing, it's because I'm in the middle of working on the custom because I'm waiting for Tempo to respond back because we were working on the custom regarding the sponsor.

369
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:25,620
So like if I start typing, if I tab out and start typing, it's because we're in the middle of that shit.

370
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,220
Anyway, I'm also going to work on my schedule today.

371
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:28,980
I debated.

372
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:32,780
I had a hard time deciding what to play because it was either this.

373
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:37,760
It was like I was before I decided to play Piglet's Big Game.

374
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,380
It was Epic Disney.

375
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,760
Oh, Epic Mickey, too.

376
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,420
Or it was Epic Mickey one.

377
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:48,100
But I realized, wait, I'm Indie now.

378
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:54,260
And I was like and I saw about I saw like tweets about Piglet's Big Game.

379
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:57,940
I was like, wait a minute, I'm Indie.

380
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:01,360
How did I get Piglet's Big Game to work?

381
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,580
I can't say.

382
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:09,080
But I'm Indie now.

383
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:22,840
Anyway, so so I was like, so I was like, fuck it.

384
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,180
We're playing Piglet's Big Game.

385
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:31,880
And I haven't I actually played this game on launch.

386
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:34,120
Oh, shit.

387
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,320
Wait, this is the doctor's.

388
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:37,240
Wait, this one actually is the doctor.

389
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:38,640
I'll be right back.

390
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:42,000
I'm going to make my call.

391
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:48,660
And I fucking, I hate the worst.

392
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,440
Oh, my God.

393
00:38:56,620 --> 00:39:07,700
OK, the nurse, the nurse, the fucking nurse was like, I'm sorry, you don't meet the criteria for urgent care.

394
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:14,300
So you got to got to find a walk in clinic and see if any of the doctors would take you.

395
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:18,360
And I was like, it's been three months.

396
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:29,900
So and then she was like, you just don't meet the criteria.

397
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:32,300
I was like, what do you mean?

398
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:40,540
Well, she was because I told her I was I went on the trip and I I went on the trip.

399
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:44,520
And they were like, oh, yeah, because you went on a trip.

400
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,960
It's most likely you caught another virus.

401
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:56,740
So because of that, it resets because they're like, usually it's like, you know, three weeks or more, then we would consider it urgent care.

402
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:02,400
But then I was like, yes, but I've been coughing for like almost two, two months now heading to the third month.

403
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:07,820
And she was like, yes, but because you went on the trip, you must have caught a new virus.

404
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:10,340
And that virus is what we're counting right now.

405
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:16,980
And because of that, it resets the timer.

406
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:22,600
So like it is a reset the timer, but like it's two weeks.

407
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:32,020
It's not three weeks because it's not three weeks because it doesn't count.

408
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:39,760
It's because you went to travel, so I caught a new virus, apparently.

409
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:43,240
They're like, most likely you caught a new virus.

410
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:48,600
So like, that's why your coughing like came back, like even worse.

411
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,680
Not worse, but like it got worse again.

412
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:57,560
And so I was like, but it's heading to the third month.

413
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:01,380
And she's like, no, you just don't meet the criteria for urgent care.

414
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:03,000
And then I was like.

415
00:41:06,290 --> 00:41:10,970
I was like, OK, so like, what do I do then?

416
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:13,250
Like, what are my options?

417
00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:15,690
She was like, well, you got it.

418
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:20,810
You can Google and see if there's any walk-in clinics around you.

419
00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:23,770
And I was like, but she was like, but they're not walk-in.

420
00:41:23,790 --> 00:41:26,770
We don't do walk-ins anymore here in our in West Coast.

421
00:41:26,810 --> 00:41:28,170
So we don't do walk-ins anymore.

422
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:30,330
But so you still have to make an appointment.

423
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:41,510
And then I was like, but I called A-plus doctors and they're all full.

424
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:44,930
And she was like, yeah, I'm sorry, sweetie.

425
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:49,470
Like, I know, but you just don't meet the criteria for urgent care.

426
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:59,650
I can't believe you can reset the timer of being sick.

427
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:03,660
Like the same thing.

428
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:09,000
And she called me, sweetie.

429
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:12,080
She called me sweetie.

430
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:17,960
And then so I was just like, at least write me a prescription.

431
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:24,900
Like, you know, I would assume she would like write me a prescription to.

432
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:26,840
I don't know.

433
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:33,960
I just, I I really assume that she would write me a prescription.

434
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:42,240
At least she's like, no, you just gotta find a way to get an appointment at a walk-in clinic somehow.

435
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:44,260
So, all right.

436
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:54,080
So my options is I go to the hospital and wait like six plus hours or go to America and get a doctor immediately.

437
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:08,140
Like, I didn't think, guys, if I knew, if I, yes, they call it walk-in clinics, but we don't do walk-ins anymore.

438
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:13,480
We apparently in our, in West Coast, we don't do walk-in anymore.

439
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:15,360
But like, we still call it walk-in.

440
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:16,800
You have to make appointments.

441
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:27,940
If they'll take me, just like I called eight different clinics yesterday and they were all like, sorry, we don't take new patients.

442
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:31,960
And I'm like, what do you mean we don't take new patients?

443
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:34,380
I don't know what to do.

444
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,100
I have a shortage of doctors.

445
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:46,540
We literally have doctors that don't want to work here.

446
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:49,020
That's like, we're so fucked.

447
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:54,340
We don't have enough supply and demand is fucking us up.

448
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:55,300
It doesn't matter.

449
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:57,960
I might throw money, I can't even throw money at the problem.

450
00:43:58,180 --> 00:43:59,680
That's the worst part, guys.

451
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:04,080
I can't, I can't even throw money at the problem.

452
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:10,860
I, like, like, like private doctors won't take me in.

453
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:15,140
Like, public doctors, I have to wait six plus hours.

454
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:16,720
What do I do?

455
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:19,660
Go to America to even see one?

456
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:27,500
Anyway, I thought it would be good news, honestly.

457
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:28,740
All right.

458
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:29,980
So, yeah.

459
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:33,940
So I shouldn't have said I went on a trip.

460
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:36,540
I don't know why the fuck I said I didn't really.

461
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:37,460
OK, now I know.

462
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:50,040
Apparently, you know, you know, like, guys, you know how it's a thing where you're not supposed to withhold information to your to your doctors slash nurses when, you know, I went with that mindset, guys.

463
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:55,820
I went with the mindset of like, don't withhold information for medical advice.

464
00:44:56,380 --> 00:44:59,600
Apparently, you should hold information regarding some medical.

465
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:13,640
Apparently, during some of these circumstances, I should have withheld that specific information.

466
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:24,840
I thought, you know, I thought it'd be helpful, but instead I got fucked over because I don't qualify for urgent care because I reset my timer.

467
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:27,340
I reset it.

468
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:30,780
All right.

469
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:31,760
So that's my update.

470
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:33,360
That's my update.

471
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:34,520
Mori, thank you for the super chat.

472
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:34,840
Thank you.

473
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:35,360
Thank you.

474
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:39,080
Easy, you ask chat and get medical advice from chat.

475
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Can anyone in chat write me a prescription?

476
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:44,980
Thank you for the super chat.

477
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:45,500
Thank you.

478
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:46,260
Thank you.

479
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:48,860
Johnny, thank you for the super chat.

480
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:49,260
Thank you.

481
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:49,940
Thank you.

482
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:52,780
I've never been so proud of our shitty health care system.

483
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:55,600
If you have money, you'll get fixed up at the least.

484
00:45:56,060 --> 00:45:57,820
America, fuck yeah!

485
00:45:58,400 --> 00:45:59,900
Thank you for the super chat.

486
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:01,180
Johnny, thank you.

487
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:02,000
Thank you.

488
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:04,700
Dory, thank you for the super chat.

489
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:05,100
Thank you.

490
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:05,820
Thank you.

491
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:09,740
Meanwhile, America, they'll take you in right away, but empty your bank account.

492
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:13,560
I can't believe Wokki's become a restaurant reservation.

493
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:16,040
Thank you for the super chat.

494
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:16,600
Thank you.

495
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:17,440
Thank you.

496
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:21,940
They're like, oh, do you have like, um...

497
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:24,860
Like, is there is it just a cough?

498
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:27,140
And I was like, well, it's been almost three months.

499
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:29,400
Like, it's clearly not just a cough anymore.

500
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:31,220
It's been almost three months.

501
00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:33,740
She's like, no, but it's just a cough.

502
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:37,680
You don't have any other like symptoms that like, you know, consider.

503
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:39,920
It's considered like urgent care.

504
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:44,200
And I'm like, I'm fucking coughing is not a great time.

505
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:49,340
I don't understand.

506
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:52,960
It's not a great time to cough every day.

507
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:55,400
Like, um...

508
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:59,640
That one dead guy.

509
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:00,740
Thank you for the super chat.

510
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:01,120
Thank you.

511
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:01,780
Thank you.

512
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:05,620
Yeah, don't withhold life-saving info like symptoms or ailment history.

513
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:08,380
But otherwise, treat doctors like the cops.

514
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:10,100
No snitching on yourself.

515
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:11,580
Thank you for the super chat.

516
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:12,080
Thank you.

517
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:12,800
Thank you.

518
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:17,320
OK, but yeah, anyway, um, that's basically.

519
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:20,280
That's basically it.

520
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:24,560
I'm back on trying to find a doctor again, trying to call her out.

521
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:27,120
This has been almost one hour of fucking.

522
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:32,620
It's been like one hour of like life up to.

523
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:35,840
It's been a very hard time.

524
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:37,340
God, it's just been.

525
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:39,200
Life has been pretty rough.

526
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:41,440
Thank you.

527
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:44,140
Oh, Justin, thank you for the magenta soup.

528
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:45,080
Thank you.

529
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:45,840
Thank you.

530
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:49,720
I just joined by notice you were nominated for three VTuber awards.

531
00:47:50,060 --> 00:47:50,820
Congrats, Doki.

532
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:52,120
Thank you for the magenta soup.

533
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:53,000
Thank you.

534
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:53,400
Thank you.

535
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:54,620
This is your first super chat.

536
00:47:55,140 --> 00:47:55,520
Thank you.

537
00:47:55,580 --> 00:47:56,580
I really appreciate it.

538
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:57,380
Thank you, guys.

539
00:47:58,680 --> 00:47:59,280
Oh, anyway.

540
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:01,020
Oh, thank you for the super chat.

541
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:01,260
Thank you.

542
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:01,600
Thank you.

543
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:07,120
To be honest, all I can ask is if your cough is productive, as in when you have mucus when you cough and you do, what color is it?

544
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:09,520
It's like yellow greenish, but it's not all the time.

545
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:12,260
It's like sometimes and it sometimes is just saliva.

546
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:16,460
Guys, are you guys actually trying to fucking WebMD me right now?

547
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:19,180
Guys, it's not useful unless you're going to write me a prescription.

548
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:24,920
It's only useful if I get a prescription.

549
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:32,680
All right, guys.

550
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:35,660
So Piglet's big dream.

551
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:40,360
Like, what am I going to do if I find out I have something really bad?

552
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:43,480
It's not like I can go to a doctor's to get something.

553
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:49,960
I'd rather I'd rather be ignorant until like a doctor tells me what it is.

554
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:52,980
Because like, what if you tell me it's like pneumonia?

555
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:54,420
What am I going to do?

556
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,520
A doctor won't even see me.

557
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:59,520
What am I going to do?

558
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:05,060
I'm just I'm just going to be more like mentally like freaking out.

559
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:14,760
I'm just going to be like, what am I going to do if I think I have pneumonia?

560
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:21,740
Um, all right.

561
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:26,220
Let's play Piglet's big dream.

562
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:31,960
For those who don't know what this game is about, this game was actually so fucking scary.

563
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:40,380
I never finished it because, um, um, I didn't even get to the ER level for those who ever play this game.

564
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:45,520
So when this game came out, everybody thought, you know, back then, Disney games went fucking hard.

565
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:46,760
You guys didn't know that.

566
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:52,700
Their Disney Interactive Disney video game studio actually went super hard in their games.

567
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:54,320
Like, it's it's crazy.

568
00:49:54,840 --> 00:50:01,700
So, um, I remember when I bought this, when my dad bought this for me, I thought it was just, you know, a fun Disney game.

569
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:04,840
But no, it was actually like, really?

570
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:12,520
It has they drew like Silent Hill slash Resident Evil aesthetics onto this game.

571
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:17,000
So there's like fixed camera angles in some cases.

572
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:21,780
And, um, and I didn't get to finish this game.

573
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:28,900
If you look at the soundtracks, if you look up this game's soundtrack, there is some like fucked up music in there.

574
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:38,120
And like, I never finished it because I was so freaked out and I never even got to the scariest level, which was Eeyore's level.

575
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:40,060
So, um.

576
00:50:41,260 --> 00:50:43,800
I assume it was Eeyore's level, the haunted mansion one.

577
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:49,840
I never got to the mansion level because like I was I was already too freaked out.

578
00:50:51,220 --> 00:50:54,420
So I never finished this game as I was when I was a kid.

579
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:57,640
So we're going to see how it goes now.

580
00:50:57,740 --> 00:51:01,560
We're going to see how how older me is going to go with this.

581
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:02,840
Wow.

582
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:04,920
I don't know if the controller works.

583
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:06,920
I plugged in my controller.

584
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:09,420
So I don't know.

585
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:10,140
Oh,

586
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:14,740
this Canada has fast shipping.

587
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:15,960
Oh, wait, not so Deadpool.

588
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:17,080
Thank you for the super chat.

589
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:17,440
Thank you.

590
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:17,720
Oh, yeah.

591
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:21,660
By the way, Canada Post is still on strike, too, by the way.

592
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:26,000
So we're messed right now.

593
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:31,580
People in Canada cannot receive any.

594
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:36,320
People in Canada are not receiving anything.

595
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:39,340
Is my controller?

596
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:40,540
Oh, I didn't.

597
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:41,660
OK, guys, give me a sec.

598
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:48,280
I won't say how I'm playing this game, but like I need I need to make sure it's the right controller.

599
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:54,960
OK, wait, can I not do?

600
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:56,800
Wait a minute.

601
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:57,180
OK.

602
00:51:57,700 --> 00:51:59,160
What controller is this?

603
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:01,100
This is.

604
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:03,760
Wait, can I not do this controller?

605
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:06,260
Oh, do I need an actual?

606
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:12,400
Do I need like an actual controller controller?

607
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:15,400
Like, can I not use guys?

608
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:19,880
Can I use.

609
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:23,980
A controller that might be.

610
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,020
Plus two.

611
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:35,100
Me.

612
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:38,760
That's all I'll say.

613
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:41,580
Oh, yeah.

614
00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:45,140
It's a PlayStation controller.

615
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:50,640
I won't say the number, but it's a PlayStation controller.

616
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:54,680
What do I connect it as?

617
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:56,240
This is my first time, by the way.

618
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:01,660
I'm playing a using a PlayStation controller.

619
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:11,900
OK, but like what does what do I categorize it as?

620
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:14,680
There's like a wheeled.

621
00:53:15,740 --> 00:53:17,800
It's not a wheeled device.

622
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:18,960
That's for sure.

623
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:21,000
What the fuck is it?

624
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:24,040
What do I categorize that as?

625
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:32,780
It doesn't say it.

626
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:35,140
It doesn't say it.

627
00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:39,240
It just says a microphone mouse.

628
00:53:42,890 --> 00:53:47,510
Wait, should I just be like, there's a train controller, too.

629
00:53:48,150 --> 00:53:49,410
What the fuck?

630
00:53:49,570 --> 00:53:51,830
What the fuck?

631
00:53:52,930 --> 00:53:54,290
OK, settings.

632
00:53:55,290 --> 00:53:56,070
God damn it.

633
00:53:56,310 --> 00:53:57,650
This is so new to me.

634
00:53:58,490 --> 00:54:01,410
Yeah, it's it's plugged in.

635
00:54:02,390 --> 00:54:04,070
Yeah, it's pretty plugged in.

636
00:54:05,210 --> 00:54:06,890
I assume it is.

637
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:13,430
OK.

638
00:54:15,030 --> 00:54:16,030
Sure is.

639
00:54:16,250 --> 00:54:18,770
I'm playing a PlayStation game right now.

640
00:54:18,930 --> 00:54:21,830
I'm playing a PlayStation game.

641
00:54:22,630 --> 00:54:24,310
Oh, I got to restart it.

642
00:54:24,430 --> 00:54:24,670
OK.

643
00:54:25,230 --> 00:54:30,070
All right, guys, guys, I'm restarting my PlayStation real quick, guys.

644
00:54:30,270 --> 00:54:32,310
I'm restarting it.

645
00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:34,450
God, I love being indie.

646
00:54:36,370 --> 00:54:38,590
Oh my God, what am I using?

647
00:54:39,190 --> 00:54:39,970
What is it called?

648
00:54:40,250 --> 00:54:42,750
I don't even remember what it's called.

649
00:54:43,210 --> 00:54:44,330
What am I using?

650
00:54:45,290 --> 00:54:47,670
OK, so the meter's only one.

651
00:54:50,050 --> 00:54:51,370
All right.

652
00:54:51,650 --> 00:54:53,250
Remind me later.

653
00:54:55,210 --> 00:54:55,870
Controllers.

654
00:54:57,390 --> 00:54:58,750
Wait, but it says like.

655
00:54:59,790 --> 00:55:01,290
It doesn't give me that option.

656
00:55:01,290 --> 00:55:03,610
It just gives me like.

657
00:55:07,150 --> 00:55:07,910
Oh.

658
00:55:07,910 --> 00:55:09,710
Yeah, I'm restarting my.

659
00:55:10,770 --> 00:55:13,570
I'm restarting my PlayStation, guys.

660
00:55:13,930 --> 00:55:15,690
I'm restarting it right now.

661
00:55:16,210 --> 00:55:17,070
Don't worry.

662
00:55:17,990 --> 00:55:18,710
Wait.

663
00:55:20,390 --> 00:55:21,030
It has.

664
00:55:21,630 --> 00:55:22,450
Wait a minute.

665
00:55:22,650 --> 00:55:24,310
Are you trying to tell me it's on PC?

666
00:55:25,150 --> 00:55:26,550
All right, what did I?

667
00:55:27,630 --> 00:55:28,970
Wait, really?

668
00:55:29,890 --> 00:55:33,530
OK, wait, give me a sec.

669
00:55:33,630 --> 00:55:34,110
All right.

670
00:55:34,850 --> 00:55:35,490
What?

671
00:55:36,510 --> 00:55:37,670
It's on PC?

672
00:55:38,670 --> 00:55:40,130
OK, I clearly.

673
00:55:40,850 --> 00:55:43,290
Guys, I'm new at this.

674
00:55:43,630 --> 00:55:46,130
I'm so new at this, guys.

675
00:55:46,610 --> 00:55:48,590
I didn't know there's a PC.

676
00:55:49,490 --> 00:55:53,990
I went like, OK, I shouldn't say that, but like I went with PlayStation 2.

677
00:55:56,070 --> 00:55:58,370
I went with PlayStation 2.

678
00:55:59,270 --> 00:56:02,150
Guys, I'm so new at this, guys.

679
00:56:02,270 --> 00:56:04,910
I'm actually so new at this.

680
00:56:07,870 --> 00:56:09,630
That it's on PC.

681
00:56:10,990 --> 00:56:12,370
Oh, my God.

682
00:56:13,550 --> 00:56:15,150
Wait, what was that?

683
00:56:15,630 --> 00:56:17,750
Well, what's that website I used?

684
00:56:18,310 --> 00:56:19,070
Legal one.

685
00:56:19,430 --> 00:56:20,610
The legal one.

686
00:56:20,810 --> 00:56:22,730
No, guys, what do you mean no research?

687
00:56:23,470 --> 00:56:27,190
I just didn't know how to get work on my PlayStation controller.

688
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:31,230
Like my one of my PlayStation's controller.

689
00:56:32,050 --> 00:56:36,090
One of my PlayStation controller.

690
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:41,110
No, I can't, I can't see it.

691
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:47,610
I'm literally looking at it, it says PlayStation 2.

692
00:56:48,330 --> 00:56:49,770
Guys, are you lying?

693
00:56:50,550 --> 00:56:52,490
Wait, does it really have?

694
00:56:53,090 --> 00:56:54,510
Is it really on PC?

695
00:56:56,510 --> 00:56:58,830
There's no way, is it really?

696
00:57:00,370 --> 00:57:02,650
There's no way it's on PC.

697
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:08,920
Wait.

698
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:12,320
Where is it?

699
00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:16,340
The PC one is a fucking new one.

700
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:17,480
Yes, I know.

701
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:20,780
OK, how to connect.

702
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:24,300
PlayStation controller.

703
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:27,520
Oh, my God.

704
00:57:27,580 --> 00:57:28,260
OK, guys, we're back.

705
00:57:28,260 --> 00:57:28,780
We're learning.

706
00:57:29,020 --> 00:57:30,100
OK, give me a sec.

707
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:33,680
I'll give you guys trying to figure out.

708
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:42,020
Trying to figure out how to connect my PlayStation controller.

709
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:51,040
If I write it down, it's not bad.

710
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:54,540
If I write, OK, I'm watching a video.

711
00:57:54,820 --> 00:57:57,720
I'm watching a YouTube video.

712
00:57:58,720 --> 00:57:59,460
All right.

713
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:01,760
All right.

714
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:04,860
Game controller.

715
00:58:05,740 --> 00:58:07,860
OK, it's on controller.

716
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:10,100
What the fuck is this?

717
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:17,600
That's not what I'm using.

718
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:21,180
Oh, this was four years ago.

719
00:58:25,060 --> 00:58:27,520
This was this was four years ago.

720
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:30,580
Everything's changed four years ago.

721
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:34,600
What?

722
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:37,360
OK, OK.

723
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:42,180
For why connection simply connect.

724
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:47,380
Well, OK, we didn't and click on plug in settings.

725
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:50,860
What the fuck is plug in settings?

726
00:58:52,540 --> 00:58:53,220
Enable.

727
00:58:53,420 --> 00:58:54,300
Oh, there it is.

728
00:58:54,460 --> 00:58:57,440
Oh, hey, wait, I found it.

729
00:58:58,040 --> 00:58:59,440
Wait, there it is.

730
00:58:59,480 --> 00:58:59,840
OK.

731
00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:01,760
Oh, there it is.

732
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:04,220
Enable DualShock 4.

733
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:08,260
Guys, I saw I mean, PlayStation DualShock 2.

734
00:59:15,060 --> 00:59:17,120
Enabled DualShock 2.

735
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:23,100
OK, we figured it out.

736
00:59:23,580 --> 00:59:27,220
OK, for 2.4.

737
00:59:27,460 --> 00:59:30,060
Sorry, I like mixed it up.

738
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:35,400
DualShock 2, there we go.

739
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:37,860
We figured it out.

740
00:59:38,260 --> 00:59:40,460
It gets easier, right?

741
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:43,040
With time, it should get easier, right?

742
00:59:43,420 --> 00:59:44,380
With time.

743
00:59:45,140 --> 00:59:46,680
Wait, how did I enable it?

744
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:47,940
It says I enabled it.

745
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,140
Does it actually enable?

746
00:59:50,140 --> 00:59:51,120
All right, let's see.

747
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:55,220
OK, I'm going to make sure it's actually enabled like oh shit.

748
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:56,060
No, not like that.

749
00:59:56,420 --> 00:59:56,900
Fuck.

750
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,900
OK, you're going to hear stuff because I'm making sure if it's actually enabled or not.

751
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:03,100
I need to make sure.

752
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:04,080
All right.

753
01:00:04,180 --> 01:00:06,100
You're going to hear sounds because I'm double checking.

754
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:08,820
Wait, how is it not working?

755
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:11,660
I have my DualShock in there.

756
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:14,300
OK, a controller.

757
01:00:14,660 --> 01:00:15,700
I enabled it.

758
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:18,440
OK, enable.

759
01:00:19,900 --> 01:00:20,860
Let's see.

760
01:00:21,820 --> 01:00:22,920
There it is.

761
01:00:22,980 --> 01:00:23,740
There it is.

762
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:25,600
It's in there.

763
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:27,280
OK.

764
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:30,820
It says it's connected.

765
01:00:31,100 --> 01:00:34,400
All right.

766
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:37,360
You got it.

767
01:00:37,360 --> 01:00:38,260
I got it calibrated.

768
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:41,780
I fucking got it.

769
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:45,860
OK, OK, I'm fucking calibrated.

770
01:00:47,620 --> 01:00:51,420
It just says, OK, we're going to figure this out together.

771
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:55,820
It takes... Wait, how?

772
01:00:55,820 --> 01:00:58,980
Oh, we're getting it.

773
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:02,360
Controller settings.

774
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,380
There's a controller settings.

775
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:05,680
Oh, is it?

776
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:07,180
Where the fuck?

777
01:01:07,820 --> 01:01:08,720
Mapping settings.

778
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:10,360
No, that's not it.

779
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,560
How the fuck do I controller setting this?

780
01:01:14,660 --> 01:01:17,940
Guys, just ignore the sounds you're hearing right now.

781
01:01:18,180 --> 01:01:19,940
This is... Ignore it.

782
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:25,240
OK, oh, my God.

783
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:26,020
This is hell.

784
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:31,540
It's mapping.

785
01:01:32,580 --> 01:01:34,080
Mapping settings.

786
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:39,600
It just says these settings ignore inversions as a result.

787
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:41,660
The... That's not it.

788
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:43,460
That's not it.

789
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:44,920
Guys.

790
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:52,860
I should have bought another PlayStation 2 that I legally own.

791
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:05,560
There's no... What do you mean there's no edit universal whatever you're saying?

792
01:02:06,220 --> 01:02:07,340
Oh, my God.

793
01:02:07,660 --> 01:02:11,820
I'm using one of the PlayStations on stream just started.

794
01:02:11,980 --> 01:02:12,540
Hey, guys.

795
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:14,860
Rosie, thank you for the super chat.

796
01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:15,480
Thank you.

797
01:02:15,620 --> 01:02:16,380
Thank you.

798
01:02:22,940 --> 01:02:25,220
Guys, please, I went through so much already.

799
01:02:25,220 --> 01:02:28,040
With the doctors, like, give me this at least.

800
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:29,500
Guys, please.

801
01:02:30,060 --> 01:02:32,000
I went through so much.

802
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:33,380
Please, guys.

803
01:02:33,580 --> 01:02:35,000
Oh, I figured it out.

804
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:36,920
Oh, my God.

805
01:02:37,060 --> 01:02:38,460
I figured it out.

806
01:02:39,220 --> 01:02:40,500
Wait, is this it?

807
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:43,060
Did I do it?

808
01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:44,160
Oh, I did it.

809
01:02:44,540 --> 01:02:45,160
Legally.

810
01:02:46,300 --> 01:02:48,140
As legally as I can.

811
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:49,820
OK, let's go.

812
01:02:53,140 --> 01:02:54,380
Let's go.

813
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:57,040
Alright, we gotta restart the game, though.

814
01:02:57,380 --> 01:02:58,080
We gotta...

815
01:02:58,080 --> 01:02:59,940
Because I skipped the intro.

816
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:02,760
We gotta restart the game.

817
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:05,420
OK, we figured it out, though.

818
01:03:06,340 --> 01:03:07,300
We figured it out.

819
01:03:07,460 --> 01:03:08,460
It's Piglet time.

820
01:03:08,980 --> 01:03:10,500
Alright, it only took us an hour.

821
01:03:10,820 --> 01:03:13,620
To be fair, I was only struggling for like...

822
01:03:13,620 --> 01:03:15,340
I struggled for like...

823
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:16,960
Um...

824
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:20,060
For like 15 minutes at most, guys.

825
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:21,640
The most...

826
01:03:21,640 --> 01:03:24,300
The rest of it was just spending on life updates.

827
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:25,160
And the doctors.

828
01:03:25,740 --> 01:03:27,000
Thank you for the 10 gifted ships.

829
01:03:27,100 --> 01:03:28,300
Thank you, thank you, Ophelia.

830
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:32,480
OK, that sure is high resolution.

831
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:35,880
I don't know what you're talking about.

832
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,260
That's how it looked.

833
01:03:38,420 --> 01:03:40,420
That's how it looked when I was a kid.

834
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:42,440
And that's how it looks now.

835
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:44,660
That's how it looks now.

836
01:03:54,220 --> 01:03:55,440
Don't stretch it?

837
01:03:56,020 --> 01:03:56,460
Why?

838
01:03:56,460 --> 01:03:58,000
What's wrong?

839
01:03:59,220 --> 01:04:00,200
What's wrong?

840
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:02,080
But it looks...

841
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:04,380
It looks better like this.

842
01:04:05,100 --> 01:04:06,040
More balls.

843
01:04:06,140 --> 01:04:07,380
Thank you for the 10 gifted ships.

844
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:08,380
Thank you, thank you.

845
01:04:08,660 --> 01:04:10,760
Thank you for the 10 gifted ships.

846
01:04:10,900 --> 01:04:11,920
Thank you, thank you.

847
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:13,280
Look at that.

848
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:16,320
I told you my PlayStation controller works.

849
01:04:16,740 --> 01:04:18,000
Alright, story time.

850
01:04:26,460 --> 01:04:27,600
Yay!

851
01:04:40,180 --> 01:04:41,360
Hey Piglet!

852
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:47,500
I'll sound out more.

853
01:04:51,020 --> 01:04:52,780
Is it better?

854
01:04:57,340 --> 01:04:57,960
Rabbit!

855
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:05,780
OK, the graphics for 20 years ago is actually really good.

856
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:10,160
This looks really, really good for 20 years ago.

857
01:05:11,980 --> 01:05:13,980
I wish I could do a remaster of this.

858
01:05:26,900 --> 01:05:28,300
Miria, thank you for the super chat.

859
01:05:28,380 --> 01:05:29,380
Thank you, thank you.

860
01:05:30,320 --> 01:05:34,280
Hey Toki, really glad to be able to enjoy my birthday even though you play such an interesting game.

861
01:05:34,340 --> 01:05:35,620
What the fuck?

862
01:05:39,260 --> 01:05:42,340
Anyway, thanks for this fun, making me smile.

863
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:43,200
Enjoy next year.

864
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:44,160
Thank you for the super chat.

865
01:05:44,260 --> 01:05:45,120
Thank you, thank you.

866
01:05:45,820 --> 01:05:47,420
Happy birthday to you.

867
01:05:47,940 --> 01:05:49,600
Happy birthday to you.

868
01:05:50,940 --> 01:05:52,280
Happy birthday dear Mira.

869
01:05:52,620 --> 01:05:53,880
Happy birthday to you.

870
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:54,180
Yeah!

871
01:05:57,720 --> 01:05:59,820
Yeah, the PTSD just kicked in there.

872
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:00,760
Christopher!

873
01:06:05,020 --> 01:06:06,180
Silly Piglet.

874
01:06:06,740 --> 01:06:07,940
You didn't take your meds.

875
01:06:13,580 --> 01:06:15,860
Yeah Piglet, you're just crazy.

876
01:06:27,290 --> 01:06:28,690
Silly old Piglet.

877
01:06:34,610 --> 01:06:36,190
This is like...

878
01:06:36,190 --> 01:06:37,450
Christopher Robin is just like...

879
01:06:37,450 --> 01:06:38,690
Don't be a pussy.

880
01:06:59,550 --> 01:07:01,170
That's not true.

881
01:07:02,510 --> 01:07:02,570
That's not true.

882
01:07:02,570 --> 01:07:04,710
They made an entire game for you, Piglet.

883
01:07:06,330 --> 01:07:09,390
That line straight to Piglet's face.

884
01:07:18,170 --> 01:07:19,010
Wow!

885
01:07:23,170 --> 01:07:23,930
Wow!

886
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:29,010
He ran away?!

887
01:07:30,030 --> 01:07:31,090
Just cause...

888
01:07:31,090 --> 01:07:32,270
Just cause they...

889
01:07:32,270 --> 01:07:35,150
Oh my god, he ran away from home!

890
01:07:35,690 --> 01:07:37,090
Because they're like...

891
01:07:38,130 --> 01:07:39,130
Silly Piglet.

892
01:07:39,830 --> 01:07:41,290
Stop being scared.

893
01:07:41,750 --> 01:07:42,690
Stop being a pussy.

894
01:07:43,530 --> 01:07:45,930
And then he ran away from home!

895
01:07:47,310 --> 01:07:48,230
That's fucked.

896
01:07:50,890 --> 01:07:51,290
Yeah.

897
01:07:51,750 --> 01:07:52,830
You wanna create a new game?

898
01:07:53,350 --> 01:07:56,110
Okay, I don't remember how the save file is gonna work, so I'm gonna...

899
01:07:56,110 --> 01:07:57,090
Oh, okay.

900
01:07:57,690 --> 01:07:58,030
Alright.

901
01:07:59,150 --> 01:08:01,110
I wonder what I want my name to be.

902
01:08:03,670 --> 01:08:04,070
Uh...

903
01:08:05,530 --> 01:08:06,850
Wait, I got an idea.

904
01:08:07,950 --> 01:08:08,830
I got an idea.

905
01:08:12,090 --> 01:08:12,490
Uh...

906
01:08:12,490 --> 01:08:14,370
Wait, how many letters can I do, though?

907
01:08:15,030 --> 01:08:16,170
No, no, no, wait, wait!

908
01:08:17,010 --> 01:08:17,750
Wait, wait, wait!

909
01:08:19,170 --> 01:08:19,550
Okay.

910
01:08:20,310 --> 01:08:21,710
Wait, no, not L.

911
01:08:22,770 --> 01:08:23,350
Fuck it.

912
01:08:23,710 --> 01:08:25,490
Let's just...

913
01:08:27,010 --> 01:08:29,110
I just wanna know how many letters!

914
01:08:31,970 --> 01:08:33,370
That's what it's gonna be!

915
01:08:38,750 --> 01:08:42,210
I don't know what the formatting does, so I'm just gonna do it.

916
01:08:43,390 --> 01:08:43,910
Yay!

917
01:08:44,790 --> 01:08:45,210
We saved!

918
01:08:46,270 --> 01:08:46,950
It's too late.

919
01:08:47,030 --> 01:08:47,610
I'm committed.

920
01:08:49,670 --> 01:08:50,630
Mistakes remain.

921
01:08:51,350 --> 01:08:54,150
Wow, just like how I remember my PlayStation 2 games.

922
01:08:55,210 --> 01:08:57,530
That's how I remember my video games.

923
01:08:58,690 --> 01:08:59,670
Wait, what's this?

924
01:09:00,310 --> 01:09:01,750
What the fuck is that?

925
01:09:04,090 --> 01:09:06,610
Oh, it's a vibration!

926
01:09:06,710 --> 01:09:07,990
Oh my God, it is vibrating!

927
01:09:08,850 --> 01:09:10,950
Okay, there's the credits.

928
01:09:11,690 --> 01:09:12,570
What's this?

929
01:09:12,690 --> 01:09:13,870
There's the center screen.

930
01:09:14,030 --> 01:09:15,150
Okay, we don't need that.

931
01:09:15,870 --> 01:09:17,750
Oh, this is like the volume, right?

932
01:09:22,950 --> 01:09:24,870
Ooh, I don't know what to do here.

933
01:09:25,930 --> 01:09:26,790
What's this?

934
01:09:28,790 --> 01:09:30,130
How do I push this?

935
01:09:31,150 --> 01:09:32,090
How do I get there?

936
01:09:33,190 --> 01:09:34,910
Wait, I wanna get over here!

937
01:09:36,490 --> 01:09:37,610
Select mono?

938
01:09:37,910 --> 01:09:39,240
Oh, wait, that's smart.

939
01:09:40,420 --> 01:09:42,680
Ball Buster 9000!

940
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:44,540
Oh, there it is.

941
01:09:44,780 --> 01:09:45,620
Get over here.

942
01:09:46,220 --> 01:09:47,580
Get over here.

943
01:09:48,580 --> 01:09:49,860
How do I get you out?

944
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:51,520
Get out!

945
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:53,440
Oh, I guess he's trapped forever.

946
01:09:54,700 --> 01:09:55,500
Do you like the music?

947
01:09:55,700 --> 01:09:57,160
The two second loop of crazy?

948
01:09:58,240 --> 01:09:59,160
Okay, I think that's good.

949
01:09:59,280 --> 01:09:59,940
I think we're ready.

950
01:10:00,740 --> 01:10:02,060
I think we're ready to go in.

951
01:10:03,100 --> 01:10:04,120
Where's the soundtrack?

952
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:09,280
Welcome to a sneak peek of Piglet's Big Game.

953
01:10:09,560 --> 01:10:11,900
It doesn't stop.

954
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:19,600
It doesn't get better.

955
01:10:21,700 --> 01:10:23,900
It doesn't get better, guys.

956
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:27,460
This was me when I played this game.

957
01:10:28,280 --> 01:10:29,800
Okay, and then, what's this?

958
01:10:30,300 --> 01:10:31,460
Oh, Disney clips?

959
01:10:31,580 --> 01:10:33,180
Oh my god, let's get in!

960
01:10:33,660 --> 01:10:35,360
Oh my god, guys, you know what?

961
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:39,540
Let's legally watch Disney clips.

962
01:10:45,620 --> 01:10:48,700
Yeah, I left my friends and now...

963
01:10:48,700 --> 01:10:51,400
Oh yeah, this was where...

964
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:54,100
So, like, basically I have the power to enter their dreams.

965
01:10:54,240 --> 01:10:55,360
Like, I don't know...

966
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:01,920
So, like...

967
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:04,040
What the fuck?

968
01:11:07,540 --> 01:11:09,360
We're gonna enter Pooh's dreams.

969
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:12,840
Alright, let's bring it down overall.

970
01:11:13,180 --> 01:11:13,460
Okay.

971
01:11:14,340 --> 01:11:15,720
Alright, I brought it down overall.

972
01:11:16,460 --> 01:11:18,860
Alright, time to go into your dreams, Pooh Bear!

973
01:11:20,840 --> 01:11:22,540
It's time to incept you.

974
01:11:23,420 --> 01:11:24,680
It's inception times.

975
01:11:32,500 --> 01:11:35,620
That's what you get for calling me a fucking pussy.

976
01:11:36,520 --> 01:11:40,340
I'm gonna go into their dreams and ruin their minds.

977
01:11:45,660 --> 01:11:47,080
What the fuck?

978
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:53,400
And then Pooh died.

979
01:11:53,580 --> 01:11:55,860
If you die in your sleep, you die in real life.

980
01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:57,920
Okay, we don't need to save our game.

981
01:11:58,400 --> 01:11:59,340
Oh, search for cookies!

982
01:12:00,500 --> 01:12:01,020
Okay.

983
01:12:02,100 --> 01:12:03,380
I'm gonna grab some cookies.

984
01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:05,860
I don't remember what the cookies were for.

985
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:08,780
Guys, it's like, this game is 20 plus years old, guys.

986
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:14,100
Okay, I'm weak too.

987
01:12:14,220 --> 01:12:15,520
Oh, cheer Piglet up!

988
01:12:16,100 --> 01:12:19,160
Okay, but Christopher Robin's advice was so...

989
01:12:19,160 --> 01:12:21,780
His advice was the reason why I fucking left!

990
01:12:29,340 --> 01:12:30,580
Thank you, Christopher Robin.

991
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:33,080
I feel better already.

992
01:12:33,540 --> 01:12:36,740
What's this, like, astrology advice I got?

993
01:12:37,160 --> 01:12:39,380
I literally...

994
01:12:39,380 --> 01:12:42,660
And oh god, oh, if we can bring down the...

995
01:12:43,340 --> 01:12:43,760
Silence.

996
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:46,380
This game came out 20 years ago.

997
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:48,360
You think there's a music volume?

998
01:12:48,940 --> 01:12:52,660
You think there's a music setting?

999
01:12:52,660 --> 01:12:52,820
Setting?

1000
01:12:56,660 --> 01:13:00,420
Okay, so there's cotton candy.

1001
01:13:01,060 --> 01:13:01,800
Give me my cookies.

1002
01:13:03,500 --> 01:13:04,840
Give me my cookies.

1003
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:08,520
Yeah, 20 years.

1004
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:09,420
That's...

1005
01:13:09,420 --> 01:13:12,920
Being able to lower the music was a privilege.

1006
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:16,200
I low...

1007
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:16,900
I turned it down.

1008
01:13:16,980 --> 01:13:18,660
Alright, I'll...

1009
01:13:19,620 --> 01:13:21,040
This is not scary.

1010
01:13:22,460 --> 01:13:23,580
Don't worry.

1011
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:32,280
Yeah, it's a happy game!

1012
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:35,140
Wait, what are you doing in this dream?

1013
01:13:45,340 --> 01:13:45,820
Oh.

1014
01:13:50,280 --> 01:13:51,000
He is?

1015
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:52,680
Wait, but what are you doing in this dream?

1016
01:13:57,940 --> 01:13:59,580
I... I never moved.

1017
01:14:01,620 --> 01:14:03,280
I never moved!

1018
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:04,480
What do you mean?

1019
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:06,580
You nearly saw me here!

1020
01:14:12,630 --> 01:14:13,150
Alright.

1021
01:14:13,710 --> 01:14:14,630
What do we have?

1022
01:14:15,430 --> 01:14:16,050
Oh, look!

1023
01:14:17,210 --> 01:14:19,170
This is like Homer Simpson's dream.

1024
01:14:20,950 --> 01:14:25,450
And... I bet like, I think they like took inspiration from Big Piglet's Big Dream.

1025
01:14:25,890 --> 01:14:27,070
Or Piglet's Big Movie.

1026
01:14:27,870 --> 01:14:30,370
Okay, see, everything seems okay for now, right?

1027
01:14:30,470 --> 01:14:31,870
It seems like happy lands.

1028
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:36,780
You're so strong, Piglet!

1029
01:14:36,920 --> 01:14:37,820
Oh my god!

1030
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:39,200
You're so strong!

1031
01:14:39,320 --> 01:14:40,140
Look at you go!

1032
01:14:41,420 --> 01:14:43,440
Nobody can stop you in dreamland!

1033
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:45,420
Oh, there's Pooh!

1034
01:14:45,940 --> 01:14:47,240
Hey, Pooh!

1035
01:14:57,190 --> 01:14:58,930
Eat yourself out!

1036
01:15:08,450 --> 01:15:08,810
Yeah!

1037
01:15:17,130 --> 01:15:17,930
But who's they?

1038
01:15:24,590 --> 01:15:26,190
Wait, Piglet, who's they?

1039
01:15:26,350 --> 01:15:27,690
Ask him who's they!

1040
01:15:29,910 --> 01:15:31,390
Okay, we gotta figure out how to get...

1041
01:15:31,390 --> 01:15:32,970
Well, we gotta figure out how to get him out.

1042
01:15:32,970 --> 01:15:34,850
Okay, so apparently...

1043
01:15:34,850 --> 01:15:35,430
Oh, rabbit?

1044
01:15:36,150 --> 01:15:37,510
Wait, there's rabbit in this dream?

1045
01:15:39,690 --> 01:15:41,250
There's rabbit in this dream?

1046
01:15:41,450 --> 01:15:42,230
In this dreamland?

1047
01:15:42,610 --> 01:15:44,730
The only thing I remember about the game...

1048
01:15:44,730 --> 01:15:47,810
Okay, so, I'm not gonna spoil you guys.

1049
01:15:47,870 --> 01:15:48,710
Oh, wait, I found a stick.

1050
01:15:49,070 --> 01:15:51,690
So, like, I remember the combat system.

1051
01:15:51,790 --> 01:15:53,410
The combat system is like really fucked.

1052
01:15:55,530 --> 01:15:57,770
Alright, grab onto my stick, Pooh.

1053
01:15:59,350 --> 01:16:01,070
Grab onto my stick, I'll pull you out.

1054
01:16:01,790 --> 01:16:03,670
Yeah, no, there's combat in this.

1055
01:16:03,730 --> 01:16:04,350
There's combat.

1056
01:16:05,290 --> 01:16:07,550
Piglet's gonna fucking brawl soon.

1057
01:16:12,330 --> 01:16:14,210
It's not what you think.

1058
01:16:14,900 --> 01:16:15,230
Combat.

1059
01:16:23,090 --> 01:16:25,970
Oh, what's Dream Rabbit like in Pooh's vision?

1060
01:16:27,430 --> 01:16:29,570
Oh my god, he's fucking built like a tank.

1061
01:16:31,830 --> 01:16:33,370
You hear the sound effects?

1062
01:16:33,510 --> 01:16:35,410
It's like...

1063
01:16:39,870 --> 01:16:45,050
Everything seems really... Yeah, guys, everything seems okay for now, right?

1064
01:16:45,690 --> 01:16:50,810
Like, look, everybody's happy and it's gumdrop land.

1065
01:16:51,410 --> 01:16:53,530
But, like...

1066
01:16:54,830 --> 01:16:58,130
You'll know why this game is fucked up.

1067
01:17:02,990 --> 01:17:06,810
This is just like how I remember my PS2 games in the resolution.

1068
01:17:08,570 --> 01:17:10,410
The high res HD.

1069
01:17:16,830 --> 01:17:17,950
I'm confused.

1070
01:17:18,210 --> 01:17:20,950
When does Sora and his keyblade show up?

1071
01:17:21,370 --> 01:17:23,190
Tori, thank you for the superchat.

1072
01:17:23,310 --> 01:17:23,990
Thank you, thank you.

1073
01:17:28,030 --> 01:17:28,590
lol

1074
01:17:31,850 --> 01:17:34,870
Yeah, the PS2 was really ahead of its time, guys.

1075
01:17:35,670 --> 01:17:37,190
It really was, though.

1076
01:17:40,510 --> 01:17:48,270
Oh, you might as well eat it.

1077
01:17:48,850 --> 01:17:49,870
Go eat it!

1078
01:17:50,090 --> 01:17:51,010
It's cotton candy!

1079
01:17:54,050 --> 01:17:54,610
Yeah!

1080
01:17:57,610 --> 01:17:59,890
Are you saying he can't do it?

1081
01:17:59,910 --> 01:18:00,810
Look at him!

1082
01:18:03,850 --> 01:18:04,590
Look at him.

1083
01:18:04,710 --> 01:18:06,730
He has so much space in there.

1084
01:18:06,830 --> 01:18:08,370
He can fucking fit that in.

1085
01:18:09,510 --> 01:18:11,530
How dare you not believe in him?

1086
01:18:13,610 --> 01:18:14,690
Eat it.

1087
01:18:15,710 --> 01:18:17,230
He's so hungry.

1088
01:18:18,390 --> 01:18:19,630
It's literally a dream.

1089
01:18:19,850 --> 01:18:21,010
Like, you can't...

1090
01:18:21,010 --> 01:18:22,810
Like, he can do anything in a dream.

1091
01:18:24,790 --> 01:18:26,170
I'm looking at this.

1092
01:18:26,870 --> 01:18:28,250
Ooh, help me with this.

1093
01:18:31,350 --> 01:18:32,310
How hungry.

1094
01:18:33,110 --> 01:18:34,710
Ooh, I need you to help me.

1095
01:18:36,650 --> 01:18:37,930
Okay, maybe I can tell him.

1096
01:18:48,630 --> 01:18:53,350
Hey, Doki, when I tried to stream a PS2 game, my monitor couldn't display the game.

1097
01:18:53,710 --> 01:18:55,110
It didn't show up on my stream.

1098
01:18:55,230 --> 01:18:57,030
Is there a compatibility issue?

1099
01:18:57,930 --> 01:18:59,290
Does anyone chat know?

1100
01:19:01,250 --> 01:19:05,090
Well, legally, there is no issue.

1101
01:19:12,310 --> 01:19:14,210
Maybe chat will know.

1102
01:19:15,070 --> 01:19:17,750
Yeah, tell us, Doki.

1103
01:19:29,570 --> 01:19:30,210
Okay.

1104
01:19:30,430 --> 01:19:31,370
Let's see.

1105
01:19:32,510 --> 01:19:33,950
How do I...

1106
01:19:33,950 --> 01:19:35,910
This is a game for children.

1107
01:19:36,130 --> 01:19:38,370
How do I...

1108
01:19:38,370 --> 01:19:40,290
Ooh, just help me.

1109
01:19:40,990 --> 01:19:42,770
He's just watching me.

1110
01:19:42,790 --> 01:19:45,050
I think that's the most fucked up part.

1111
01:19:45,750 --> 01:19:48,310
He's literally just watching me jump.

1112
01:19:48,310 --> 01:19:48,670
Oh.

1113
01:19:51,190 --> 01:19:52,850
I don't even have a stick.

1114
01:19:55,550 --> 01:19:56,990
Okay, Owl, what do I do?

1115
01:19:57,350 --> 01:19:57,970
I'm desperate.

1116
01:19:58,070 --> 01:19:58,590
You're tall.

1117
01:20:01,810 --> 01:20:02,290
Owl?

1118
01:20:03,190 --> 01:20:04,970
Owl, you don't want to talk to me?

1119
01:20:06,630 --> 01:20:08,070
Owl, talk to me!

1120
01:20:08,290 --> 01:20:08,530
No!

1121
01:20:09,950 --> 01:20:11,630
Why does he want to talk to me?

1122
01:20:12,110 --> 01:20:15,870
Okay, maybe if I talk to Christopher for advice.

1123
01:20:19,870 --> 01:20:24,150
Maybe Christopher will talk to me, and then Owl will talk to me, because then he'll be like, Wow!

1124
01:20:25,970 --> 01:20:30,210
If Christopher Robin is willing to talk to Piglet, maybe she's cool enough.

1125
01:20:35,030 --> 01:20:35,770
I'm in.

1126
01:20:36,550 --> 01:20:36,850
Alright.

1127
01:20:37,210 --> 01:20:41,190
And then Owl would be like, maybe he is cool enough.

1128
01:20:42,190 --> 01:20:42,790
Owl, please.

1129
01:20:42,930 --> 01:20:45,150
Oh, maybe Owl will talk to me on the other screen.

1130
01:20:46,150 --> 01:20:47,290
Maybe the other...

1131
01:20:47,290 --> 01:20:47,770
Owl.

1132
01:20:48,210 --> 01:20:49,470
Owl number two!

1133
01:20:50,010 --> 01:20:51,870
There's another Owl over here, right?

1134
01:20:52,030 --> 01:20:52,490
Yeah, I remember.

1135
01:20:52,610 --> 01:20:53,670
There was another Owl here.

1136
01:20:54,150 --> 01:20:54,950
Wait, where did he go?

1137
01:20:55,750 --> 01:20:56,510
Oh, there he is.

1138
01:20:56,590 --> 01:20:57,510
Okay, Owl number...

1139
01:20:57,510 --> 01:20:58,410
Oh, okay, never mind.

1140
01:20:58,470 --> 01:20:59,090
That was him.

1141
01:21:01,950 --> 01:21:02,430
That...

1142
01:21:03,410 --> 01:21:04,190
Owl, please!

1143
01:21:04,930 --> 01:21:05,970
I can't progress!

1144
01:21:06,670 --> 01:21:07,150
No!

1145
01:21:07,950 --> 01:21:08,830
I can't...

1146
01:21:11,630 --> 01:21:12,590
I just...

1147
01:21:12,590 --> 01:21:14,270
Owl, my soft lock!

1148
01:21:17,290 --> 01:21:19,410
He was Owl number two.

1149
01:21:21,010 --> 01:21:22,490
I don't understand!

1150
01:21:23,690 --> 01:21:26,550
Maybe if I get this one cookie he'll talk to me.

1151
01:21:28,550 --> 01:21:31,290
Maybe if I get this other cookie...

1152
01:21:31,990 --> 01:21:32,230
Okay.

1153
01:21:33,830 --> 01:21:34,230
Alright.

1154
01:21:34,530 --> 01:21:36,030
Owl, will you talk to me now?

1155
01:21:36,490 --> 01:21:38,490
Why won't you talk to me?!

1156
01:21:39,470 --> 01:21:40,110
Why?!

1157
01:21:40,110 --> 01:21:41,190
I don't...

1158
01:21:41,190 --> 01:21:43,630
Why won't you talk to me?!

1159
01:21:43,630 --> 01:21:44,230
Owl!

1160
01:21:44,510 --> 01:21:45,430
What did I do?!

1161
01:21:48,090 --> 01:21:49,450
Alright, maybe...

1162
01:21:49,450 --> 01:21:51,190
Oh, I don't know what to do.

1163
01:21:51,350 --> 01:21:53,290
You talk to me?!

1164
01:21:57,410 --> 01:21:58,610
I don't know!

1165
01:21:59,250 --> 01:22:03,450
He doesn't even talk to me!

1166
01:22:03,850 --> 01:22:04,990
I can't...

1167
01:22:04,990 --> 01:22:06,670
Owl, please!

1168
01:22:07,850 --> 01:22:09,210
Owl, please!

1169
01:22:09,530 --> 01:22:10,990
I'm... Please!

1170
01:22:11,110 --> 01:22:11,690
Owl!

1171
01:22:13,030 --> 01:22:13,710
Please!

1172
01:22:13,710 --> 01:22:14,790
Please!

1173
01:22:16,410 --> 01:22:21,210
I cannot progress if you don't talk to me!

1174
01:22:26,590 --> 01:22:27,990
Owl, please!

1175
01:22:29,050 --> 01:22:29,770
Please!

1176
01:22:30,170 --> 01:22:32,250
I need you!

1177
01:22:32,730 --> 01:22:33,350
Please!

1178
01:22:34,070 --> 01:22:36,330
Okay, I'm gonna save my game and then see if that works.

1179
01:22:36,430 --> 01:22:36,730
Okay.

1180
01:22:37,290 --> 01:22:38,950
I'm gonna restart my game.

1181
01:22:39,390 --> 01:22:40,590
I cannot progress!

1182
01:22:41,070 --> 01:22:42,530
He doesn't want to speak to me!

1183
01:22:43,470 --> 01:22:43,990
Why?!

1184
01:22:43,990 --> 01:22:47,250
Why don't you want to speak to me, Owl?!

1185
01:22:47,250 --> 01:22:49,330
What did I do?!

1186
01:22:49,330 --> 01:22:50,130
What?!

1187
01:22:51,110 --> 01:22:53,990
What did I do?!

1188
01:22:55,310 --> 01:22:56,270
Owl, please!

1189
01:22:57,970 --> 01:22:59,630
Guys, I need to restart my game.

1190
01:22:59,870 --> 01:23:05,330
I don't understand!

1191
01:23:05,810 --> 01:23:06,330
Owl!

1192
01:23:06,470 --> 01:23:07,710
What did I do wrong?!

1193
01:23:09,630 --> 01:23:12,870
What did I do wrong?!

1194
01:23:12,870 --> 01:23:13,370
Owl!

1195
01:23:14,130 --> 01:23:15,550
What could I have paused?

1196
01:23:16,670 --> 01:23:19,230
Guys, I'm restarting my PS2.

1197
01:23:19,630 --> 01:23:20,310
Click.

1198
01:23:24,130 --> 01:23:28,630
Guys, I think there's a scratch on my disc.

1199
01:23:29,190 --> 01:23:29,750
Let me just...

1200
01:23:31,410 --> 01:23:32,090
Okay.

1201
01:23:32,770 --> 01:23:33,790
I put it back in.

1202
01:23:34,270 --> 01:23:34,830
There we go.

1203
01:23:35,910 --> 01:23:36,590
There we go.

1204
01:23:36,650 --> 01:23:37,570
Now it should be better.

1205
01:23:38,010 --> 01:23:42,170
I blew on a disc.

1206
01:23:42,490 --> 01:23:43,850
I blew on a memory card too.

1207
01:23:50,870 --> 01:23:52,870
I blew on a memory card.

1208
01:23:52,970 --> 01:23:55,870
I got a towel and like wiped it too.

1209
01:23:56,230 --> 01:23:58,990
I got a towel.

1210
01:23:59,170 --> 01:24:00,750
I wet it and then wiped it up.

1211
01:24:01,510 --> 01:24:02,170
There we go.

1212
01:24:02,270 --> 01:24:03,490
That should be fine, right?

1213
01:24:07,050 --> 01:24:09,550
Dust got stuck on the disc reader.

1214
01:24:10,370 --> 01:24:11,690
It should be fine.

1215
01:24:12,430 --> 01:24:14,370
Maybe Owl will talk to me now.

1216
01:24:14,470 --> 01:24:15,170
Owl, please.

1217
01:24:15,490 --> 01:24:18,770
Please just talk to me.

1218
01:24:18,810 --> 01:24:19,710
I can't progress.

1219
01:24:20,670 --> 01:24:22,810
They won't let me do anything.

1220
01:24:25,410 --> 01:24:25,750
Okay.

1221
01:24:27,830 --> 01:24:29,390
My PS2 boots up fast?

1222
01:24:29,570 --> 01:24:30,870
Yeah, I got the...

1223
01:24:30,870 --> 01:24:33,450
I paid extra for the PS2 Pro.

1224
01:24:38,290 --> 01:24:40,110
Owl, please!

1225
01:24:40,610 --> 01:24:42,370
Owl, please!

1226
01:24:42,810 --> 01:24:43,690
Owl!

1227
01:24:44,290 --> 01:24:48,250
I don't understand!

1228
01:24:53,270 --> 01:24:57,330
Guys, we can replay this specific section.

1229
01:24:58,110 --> 01:25:02,070
No, I got the PS2 Pro Slim.

1230
01:25:02,730 --> 01:25:03,450
You guys don't know.

1231
01:25:03,630 --> 01:25:06,150
Only like 10 were ever released, guys.

1232
01:25:06,150 --> 01:25:09,430
Okay, maybe there's like...

1233
01:25:10,030 --> 01:25:12,490
There's no way I got softlocked.

1234
01:25:12,510 --> 01:25:14,270
There's no fucking way.

1235
01:25:14,810 --> 01:25:19,570
Like, he's just staring at me like the fucking... He knows.

1236
01:25:19,930 --> 01:25:20,650
He knows.

1237
01:25:21,050 --> 01:25:22,210
He fucking...

1238
01:25:22,210 --> 01:25:24,790
He knows.

1239
01:25:25,250 --> 01:25:26,250
He fucking knows.

1240
01:25:26,690 --> 01:25:28,010
How does he know?

1241
01:25:28,490 --> 01:25:30,490
How did you know?

1242
01:25:31,230 --> 01:25:33,270
I don't understand!

1243
01:25:35,050 --> 01:25:35,690
Please!

1244
01:25:36,210 --> 01:25:38,970
I really wanted to play this game.

1245
01:25:39,750 --> 01:25:42,950
Owl really said skill issue.

1246
01:25:43,390 --> 01:25:45,010
Thank you for the super chat, Cody.

1247
01:25:45,130 --> 01:25:45,570
Thank you.

1248
01:25:47,050 --> 01:25:49,070
He knows my secrets.

1249
01:25:49,170 --> 01:25:50,890
He knows what I did last summer.

1250
01:25:54,570 --> 01:25:56,090
Is this a horror?

1251
01:25:59,210 --> 01:26:02,290
Let me through, Owl, please!

1252
01:26:04,610 --> 01:26:05,990
Please, Owl!

1253
01:26:06,730 --> 01:26:07,910
Acknowledge me!

1254
01:26:09,190 --> 01:26:10,870
Acknowledge me!

1255
01:26:11,110 --> 01:26:12,570
That's all I want!

1256
01:26:13,230 --> 01:26:16,730
I just want you to acknowledge me!

1257
01:26:19,290 --> 01:26:21,090
Owl, please!

1258
01:26:25,410 --> 01:26:27,530
I don't understand!

1259
01:26:27,530 --> 01:26:30,270
What did I do wrong?

1260
01:26:32,290 --> 01:26:36,830
Learn the other stuff I did, but what else could I have done wrong?

1261
01:26:39,170 --> 01:26:40,170
Okay, Pooh.

1262
01:26:41,090 --> 01:26:42,450
You might be on your own.

1263
01:26:42,590 --> 01:26:44,610
I'm gonna visit Rue's dream.

1264
01:26:49,770 --> 01:26:52,350
Pooh, he won't talk to me!

1265
01:26:57,530 --> 01:26:59,030
Let me through this cotton candy.

1266
01:26:59,730 --> 01:27:03,410
Perhaps Owl will know what to do.

1267
01:27:04,350 --> 01:27:06,970
He won't even talk to me!

1268
01:27:11,910 --> 01:27:13,910
I can't!

1269
01:27:13,910 --> 01:27:15,250
I can't!

1270
01:27:22,590 --> 01:27:25,170
Oh my god.

1271
01:27:25,620 --> 01:27:27,230
Kick everything up.

1272
01:27:32,250 --> 01:27:34,350
I'm so mad!

1273
01:27:35,490 --> 01:27:37,470
I wish I could kick Owl.

1274
01:27:38,050 --> 01:27:40,050
I wish I could kick him.

1275
01:27:40,670 --> 01:27:41,690
I wish I could.

1276
01:27:41,690 --> 01:27:42,890
Please, will you talk?

1277
01:27:43,110 --> 01:27:44,050
You saw what I did.

1278
01:27:44,470 --> 01:27:46,430
You saw what I did!

1279
01:27:47,810 --> 01:27:49,990
Please, acknowledge me!

1280
01:27:51,950 --> 01:27:54,270
Please, acknowledge me!

1281
01:27:55,230 --> 01:27:57,030
It's all I want!

1282
01:28:00,190 --> 01:28:01,090
He knows.

1283
01:28:02,990 --> 01:28:04,830
He's not afraid of me.

1284
01:28:05,570 --> 01:28:07,310
Alright, it's time to start a new save.

1285
01:28:07,650 --> 01:28:09,670
It's time to start.

1286
01:28:09,670 --> 01:28:09,890
It's time to start.

1287
01:28:11,460 --> 01:28:12,770
It's okay, we're in the beginning.

1288
01:28:13,450 --> 01:28:14,950
Guys, we're in the beginning.

1289
01:28:15,690 --> 01:28:17,330
We can start a new save.

1290
01:28:17,450 --> 01:28:18,350
It's fine.

1291
01:28:19,170 --> 01:28:21,530
I don't need you.

1292
01:28:21,810 --> 01:28:24,530
I don't need you, Owl.

1293
01:28:24,850 --> 01:28:27,050
I never needed you.

1294
01:28:29,570 --> 01:28:32,670
I see this is why it's called a horror game.

1295
01:28:35,670 --> 01:28:37,030
This next save.

1296
01:28:37,810 --> 01:28:38,410
Okay.

1297
01:28:39,370 --> 01:28:40,090
This time.

1298
01:28:41,570 --> 01:28:42,510
This time.

1299
01:28:42,590 --> 01:28:43,610
This time it'll be different.

1300
01:28:44,250 --> 01:28:45,990
It's gonna be different now, guys.

1301
01:28:46,050 --> 01:28:46,930
It's gonna be different.

1302
01:28:48,390 --> 01:28:49,370
I figured it out.

1303
01:28:53,100 --> 01:28:54,740
I figured it out.

1304
01:28:55,580 --> 01:28:56,620
I don't need his help.

1305
01:29:00,630 --> 01:29:01,510
This is it.

1306
01:29:02,070 --> 01:29:02,330
Alright.

1307
01:29:05,250 --> 01:29:06,690
Alright, this is fine.

1308
01:29:07,950 --> 01:29:09,810
It was the beginning, it's fine.

1309
01:29:09,810 --> 01:29:11,710
It's fine.

1310
01:29:13,670 --> 01:29:14,190
Okay.

1311
01:29:15,570 --> 01:29:16,350
Owl.

1312
01:29:17,310 --> 01:29:18,050
No.

1313
01:29:20,650 --> 01:29:21,690
His.

1314
01:29:24,150 --> 01:29:25,510
Alright, that's fine.

1315
01:29:26,190 --> 01:29:27,330
Now he'll notice me.

1316
01:29:28,570 --> 01:29:30,450
He'll notice me this time.

1317
01:29:32,470 --> 01:29:34,290
It will be okay.

1318
01:29:35,870 --> 01:29:38,470
He's gonna notice me this time.

1319
01:29:39,390 --> 01:29:40,810
Everything will be fine.

1320
01:29:41,050 --> 01:29:41,890
We're back in this.

1321
01:29:42,010 --> 01:29:44,090
Okay, I think all the volume stuff is fine.

1322
01:29:44,670 --> 01:29:45,030
Alright.

1323
01:29:46,570 --> 01:29:47,370
Don't worry.

1324
01:29:48,370 --> 01:29:50,530
Owl's gonna acknowledge me.

1325
01:29:51,750 --> 01:29:53,130
I can speedrun this.

1326
01:29:54,030 --> 01:29:55,230
I'm gonna go so fast.

1327
01:29:55,630 --> 01:29:56,430
Look at me go.

1328
01:29:56,690 --> 01:29:58,730
I'm gonna go so fast.

1329
01:29:59,410 --> 01:30:00,090
Owl, please.

1330
01:30:00,670 --> 01:30:01,050
Please.

1331
01:30:01,710 --> 01:30:03,490
This is the beginning, Owl.

1332
01:30:03,590 --> 01:30:04,170
Please.

1333
01:30:04,170 --> 01:30:04,490
Please.

1334
01:30:06,370 --> 01:30:06,930
Okay.

1335
01:30:08,450 --> 01:30:09,250
Don't worry.

1336
01:30:09,530 --> 01:30:10,130
We got this.

1337
01:30:10,230 --> 01:30:10,990
We figured it out.

1338
01:30:12,290 --> 01:30:13,870
We figured it out.

1339
01:30:16,170 --> 01:30:20,370
Oh, I need a disabled widescreen on my PS2?

1340
01:30:20,790 --> 01:30:22,110
Okay, give me a sec.

1341
01:30:26,570 --> 01:30:27,930
I can do that.

1342
01:30:28,490 --> 01:30:30,870
Oh, but I like widescreen.

1343
01:30:31,970 --> 01:30:34,010
I like widescreen.

1344
01:30:34,850 --> 01:30:35,250
Okay.

1345
01:30:37,030 --> 01:30:37,830
Oh, man.

1346
01:30:39,050 --> 01:30:41,950
Now I have to do 4-3.

1347
01:30:50,170 --> 01:30:50,570
Okay.

1348
01:30:51,090 --> 01:30:52,390
I don't know if I should put it here.

1349
01:30:52,570 --> 01:30:53,250
Do I put it here?

1350
01:30:53,930 --> 01:30:54,830
Or put it in the center?

1351
01:30:54,990 --> 01:30:55,670
Guys, what do you think?

1352
01:30:57,230 --> 01:30:59,270
Return of 4-3.

1353
01:31:00,870 --> 01:31:07,630
Do I put it in the center or do I put it in the left side?

1354
01:31:08,450 --> 01:31:08,970
Okay.

1355
01:31:10,910 --> 01:31:12,270
There we go.

1356
01:31:14,210 --> 01:31:14,530
Alright.

1357
01:31:15,490 --> 01:31:16,010
Okay.

1358
01:31:16,650 --> 01:31:18,130
I'm not a fan of 4-3.

1359
01:31:21,470 --> 01:31:22,670
Alright, here we go.

1360
01:31:24,350 --> 01:31:25,810
I like widescreen more.

1361
01:31:28,370 --> 01:31:28,770
Okay.

1362
01:31:28,770 --> 01:31:29,390
Fuck you.

1363
01:31:30,230 --> 01:31:30,630
Wait.

1364
01:31:31,670 --> 01:31:33,370
Oh my god, no, I couldn't speedrun this.

1365
01:31:34,510 --> 01:31:34,770
Alright.

1366
01:31:36,030 --> 01:31:37,330
Well, I could make it bigger.

1367
01:31:37,410 --> 01:31:37,810
You're right.

1368
01:31:37,950 --> 01:31:40,190
I just don't like 4-3 because of the empty space.

1369
01:31:40,470 --> 01:31:42,550
That's like my biggest issue with 4-3.

1370
01:31:43,210 --> 01:31:45,090
I hate the empty space of it.

1371
01:31:45,690 --> 01:31:46,290
There we go.

1372
01:31:46,450 --> 01:31:48,110
And then I'll put it behind me.

1373
01:31:50,830 --> 01:31:51,230
There.

1374
01:31:52,290 --> 01:31:53,350
Alright, let's go.

1375
01:31:53,410 --> 01:31:54,010
We're speedrunning.

1376
01:31:56,770 --> 01:31:57,570
We're speedrunning.

1377
01:31:58,230 --> 01:31:59,510
We can do this.

1378
01:31:59,990 --> 01:32:00,870
PooBear, I'm coming over!

1379
01:32:03,050 --> 01:32:04,850
It's not like I've done this before.

1380
01:32:05,310 --> 01:32:05,970
Well, I have.

1381
01:32:06,050 --> 01:32:06,790
This is like...

1382
01:32:07,390 --> 01:32:08,610
Technically, I have.

1383
01:32:09,210 --> 01:32:10,490
PooBear, I'm coming over!

1384
01:32:11,350 --> 01:32:13,570
Oh, I need to talk to you before I get the stick.

1385
01:32:14,510 --> 01:32:15,050
This is it.

1386
01:32:16,450 --> 01:32:17,730
Alright, and then we get the stick.

1387
01:32:18,830 --> 01:32:19,150
Alright.

1388
01:32:20,270 --> 01:32:22,310
But hey guys, thank you for the super chat.

1389
01:32:22,730 --> 01:32:23,890
Alright, get over here, PooBear.

1390
01:32:23,890 --> 01:32:24,890
I figured it out.

1391
01:32:25,130 --> 01:32:26,250
Get over here!

1392
01:32:28,590 --> 01:32:30,250
Alright, everything is fine now.

1393
01:32:30,670 --> 01:32:32,090
Okay, now we gotta go back.

1394
01:32:32,610 --> 01:32:34,210
Oh, there's more cookies here?

1395
01:32:34,910 --> 01:32:35,570
Wait, I forgot.

1396
01:32:35,730 --> 01:32:37,990
I remember cookies was like a currency for something.

1397
01:32:38,610 --> 01:32:39,950
But I don't remember for what.

1398
01:32:40,350 --> 01:32:41,510
Wait, we gotta collect the cookies.

1399
01:32:42,290 --> 01:32:44,370
Like, I remember you have to use the cookies for something.

1400
01:32:45,730 --> 01:32:47,450
But I don't remember what it was for.

1401
01:32:47,830 --> 01:32:48,890
Oh my god, this is it.

1402
01:32:48,930 --> 01:32:50,310
Owl will finally notice me.

1403
01:32:51,450 --> 01:32:55,090
He'll finally notice me and acknowledge me as a person.

1404
01:32:55,230 --> 01:32:57,530
That I'm real in this world.

1405
01:32:57,750 --> 01:32:58,110
I knew.

1406
01:32:58,810 --> 01:32:59,510
I knew it.

1407
01:32:59,670 --> 01:33:00,350
That's the thing!

1408
01:33:00,510 --> 01:33:07,150
I thought like, since I'm a pig in an animal farm, they say that pigs are more equal than others.

1409
01:33:07,570 --> 01:33:10,150
Like, I should be more equal than an owl.

1410
01:33:10,710 --> 01:33:12,190
Why doesn't he acknowledge me?

1411
01:33:13,270 --> 01:33:13,910
Why does...

1412
01:33:16,670 --> 01:33:19,510
Why doesn't he acknowledge me?

1413
01:33:21,290 --> 01:33:21,890
Okay.

1414
01:33:22,110 --> 01:33:23,370
We gotta grab this.

1415
01:33:27,960 --> 01:33:29,200
We read Animal Farm?

1416
01:33:29,340 --> 01:33:30,260
I went to school.

1417
01:33:30,420 --> 01:33:32,880
We all had to read Animal Farm.

1418
01:33:37,380 --> 01:33:37,980
Okay.

1419
01:33:39,100 --> 01:33:40,300
Alright, this is it.

1420
01:33:40,360 --> 01:33:41,020
Okay, Owl.

1421
01:33:41,680 --> 01:33:42,620
Get over here!

1422
01:33:43,220 --> 01:33:44,280
Get over here!

1423
01:33:44,440 --> 01:33:45,340
Talk to me!

1424
01:33:45,960 --> 01:33:47,720
He talked to me!

1425
01:33:47,720 --> 01:33:47,880
It's me!

1426
01:33:48,080 --> 01:33:48,860
Oh my god!

1427
01:33:50,380 --> 01:33:50,880
It's me!

1428
01:33:53,860 --> 01:33:54,320
Yeah!

1429
01:33:59,980 --> 01:34:06,460
We did it.

1430
01:34:11,260 --> 01:34:12,020
No shit!

1431
01:34:12,120 --> 01:34:13,480
The water can't reach!

1432
01:34:23,130 --> 01:34:24,450
I don't...

1433
01:34:24,450 --> 01:34:26,510
I thought he was gonna give me a boost!

1434
01:34:27,230 --> 01:34:28,190
You mean this water?

1435
01:34:28,810 --> 01:34:30,070
That it can't reach?

1436
01:34:30,670 --> 01:34:31,910
You mean this one?

1437
01:34:33,750 --> 01:34:35,070
You mean...

1438
01:34:35,070 --> 01:34:36,590
That was the advice I...

1439
01:34:38,110 --> 01:34:38,770
Okay.

1440
01:34:40,950 --> 01:34:42,570
Let's get some cookies.

1441
01:34:43,010 --> 01:34:44,670
Let's get some cookies.

1442
01:34:46,180 --> 01:34:48,010
I had a rough day, guys.

1443
01:34:48,010 --> 01:34:50,250
And I'm not here for Owl's bullshit.

1444
01:34:52,870 --> 01:34:55,670
I'm playing at 4-3 for this.

1445
01:34:57,130 --> 01:34:59,470
He said we need water.

1446
01:35:08,730 --> 01:35:11,510
We didn't need to ask Owl for this!

1447
01:35:18,010 --> 01:35:20,230
We never needed to ask Owl for this!

1448
01:35:20,990 --> 01:35:22,250
There is an order to...

1449
01:35:28,110 --> 01:35:29,230
Absolute unit.

1450
01:35:30,150 --> 01:35:32,170
If Sora was here, he would figure it out.

1451
01:35:33,330 --> 01:35:33,650
Yeah!

1452
01:35:33,650 --> 01:35:33,990
Yeah!

1453
01:35:42,250 --> 01:35:48,770
Alright, we gotta find honey.

1454
01:35:55,530 --> 01:35:56,130
Wait, what?

1455
01:35:57,890 --> 01:35:58,570
What?

1456
01:35:59,390 --> 01:36:00,070
Heffalumps?

1457
01:36:06,830 --> 01:36:10,670
Not the he- Oh my god, he aged like 70 years from that?

1458
01:36:11,090 --> 01:36:11,730
Oh my...

1459
01:36:13,270 --> 01:36:16,710
Oh my god, when you hear that Heffalumps...

1460
01:36:16,710 --> 01:36:18,770
He actually...

1461
01:36:18,770 --> 01:36:19,750
Holy shit!

1462
01:36:20,430 --> 01:36:21,870
He turned like 80.

1463
01:36:23,350 --> 01:36:24,470
Okay, let's see.

1464
01:36:24,570 --> 01:36:26,310
Move the chat a little bit here.

1465
01:36:28,330 --> 01:36:29,570
Okay, so...

1466
01:36:29,570 --> 01:36:32,570
Did I scratch my butt and smell my...

1467
01:36:32,570 --> 01:36:33,030
Piglet!

1468
01:36:34,090 --> 01:36:34,710
Piglet!

1469
01:36:37,510 --> 01:36:39,650
I think Pooh Bear is a really bad friend.

1470
01:36:41,250 --> 01:36:41,870
Like...

1471
01:36:41,870 --> 01:36:42,830
Not gonna lie.

1472
01:36:43,690 --> 01:36:46,810
I think he's actually a really bad friend.

1473
01:36:46,810 --> 01:36:47,810
Wait...

1474
01:36:49,870 --> 01:36:51,390
There they are!

1475
01:36:53,590 --> 01:36:55,050
The Heffalumps and Woozles.

1476
01:36:57,090 --> 01:36:59,590
Okay, so there's gonna be a com- Oh look, that's me!

1477
01:37:00,770 --> 01:37:01,370
That's me!

1478
01:37:01,910 --> 01:37:02,250
Alright.

1479
01:37:03,470 --> 01:37:05,050
Let's see, we're gonna grab some cookies.

1480
01:37:05,670 --> 01:37:06,630
Real fast.

1481
01:37:06,850 --> 01:37:07,790
What is he gonna do?

1482
01:37:07,890 --> 01:37:08,730
Fucking kill me?

1483
01:37:08,970 --> 01:37:10,610
This is a children's game.

1484
01:37:11,790 --> 01:37:13,230
Okay, maybe I kick this.

1485
01:37:13,230 --> 01:37:14,230
Is there stuff here?

1486
01:37:15,830 --> 01:37:16,310
Okay.

1487
01:37:16,690 --> 01:37:19,790
I mean, it's a nice dream other than the Heffalumps and the Woozles.

1488
01:37:21,450 --> 01:37:22,970
Okay, we just gotta go here.

1489
01:37:26,830 --> 01:37:27,310
Oh.

1490
01:37:32,530 --> 01:37:34,410
Oh wait, this is where we came from.

1491
01:37:37,290 --> 01:37:38,250
Melting it...

1492
01:37:38,250 --> 01:37:39,890
Do I push something?

1493
01:37:39,890 --> 01:37:41,390
Oh wait, more cookies.

1494
01:37:43,450 --> 01:37:45,650
Okay, got more cookies though.

1495
01:37:47,530 --> 01:37:48,070
What?

1496
01:37:49,690 --> 01:37:52,190
I don't have any magnifying glass.

1497
01:37:52,770 --> 01:37:56,110
Yeah, why can't I just- I'm tiny, I can't just eat the door chat.

1498
01:37:56,870 --> 01:37:59,310
Not everything can be solved by eating.

1499
01:38:01,350 --> 01:38:08,170
How do I- Do I kick- Okay, at least I got this.

1500
01:38:09,010 --> 01:38:11,490
I think everything can be solved by kicking?

1501
01:38:16,230 --> 01:38:20,010
How do I eat the- Let's see.

1502
01:38:20,190 --> 01:38:22,210
Not with that attitude.

1503
01:38:23,270 --> 01:38:25,730
You didn't even try, Doki.

1504
01:38:27,890 --> 01:38:31,710
Where's the- No, he doesn't know.

1505
01:38:32,030 --> 01:38:32,810
He doesn't know.

1506
01:38:33,490 --> 01:38:34,750
He doesn't know.

1507
01:38:35,470 --> 01:38:36,710
How does he know?

1508
01:38:36,710 --> 01:38:38,370
How does he know?

1509
01:38:42,410 --> 01:38:43,970
Okay, we might as well kick this.

1510
01:38:44,670 --> 01:38:45,110
You know what?

1511
01:38:45,190 --> 01:38:45,730
Let's fight.

1512
01:38:47,630 --> 01:38:49,130
Wait, maybe it's the mirror.

1513
01:38:49,350 --> 01:38:49,690
Yeah.

1514
01:38:50,950 --> 01:38:53,970
Now I know why I got stuck on this game for a long time.

1515
01:38:55,390 --> 01:38:57,090
I'm not tall enough!

1516
01:38:58,470 --> 01:38:59,070
That's it.

1517
01:38:59,230 --> 01:39:00,890
That's- I'm gonna fight you.

1518
01:39:01,330 --> 01:39:02,530
I'm gonna fucking fight you.

1519
01:39:02,530 --> 01:39:03,430
Get over here.

1520
01:39:04,090 --> 01:39:05,070
That's right.

1521
01:39:05,250 --> 01:39:06,730
I'm gonna fight you.

1522
01:39:10,230 --> 01:39:12,670
Okay, I- Okay, nevermind.

1523
01:39:12,770 --> 01:39:14,110
I'm not gonna fight you.

1524
01:39:14,510 --> 01:39:14,990
Never-

1525
01:39:18,570 --> 01:39:19,250
Nevermind.

1526
01:39:22,310 --> 01:39:24,370
Oh no, I'm scared now.

1527
01:39:25,390 --> 01:39:26,530
I'm scared.

1528
01:39:26,690 --> 01:39:28,070
I'm so scared.

1529
01:39:28,070 --> 01:39:28,230
I'm scared.

1530
01:39:30,750 --> 01:39:31,970
Oh no.

1531
01:39:32,650 --> 01:39:34,970
No, I'm scared now.

1532
01:39:36,390 --> 01:39:36,750
Okay.

1533
01:39:37,170 --> 01:39:39,130
If we can't- There's no way.

1534
01:39:40,250 --> 01:39:41,890
Okay, we'll fight him again.

1535
01:39:46,300 --> 01:39:47,820
Okay, don't worry.

1536
01:39:47,940 --> 01:39:49,440
Now, get over here.

1537
01:39:49,620 --> 01:39:50,680
I'm ready to fight.

1538
01:39:51,780 --> 01:39:52,720
That's right.

1539
01:39:54,440 --> 01:39:55,120
Alright.

1540
01:39:55,780 --> 01:39:56,560
Get over here.

1541
01:39:56,560 --> 01:39:56,680
Get over here.

1542
01:39:58,340 --> 01:39:58,900
Yeah!

1543
01:39:59,260 --> 01:40:00,340
That's fucking right.

1544
01:40:02,740 --> 01:40:03,300
See?

1545
01:40:03,460 --> 01:40:03,880
There we go.

1546
01:40:03,920 --> 01:40:04,380
We did it.

1547
01:40:05,140 --> 01:40:06,400
We needed to fight him.

1548
01:40:09,320 --> 01:40:10,620
Yeah, that's the combat.

1549
01:40:14,140 --> 01:40:16,460
That was the combat.

1550
01:40:16,980 --> 01:40:17,280
See?

1551
01:40:17,340 --> 01:40:18,120
It's that easy.

1552
01:40:19,160 --> 01:40:20,340
I scared him so hard.

1553
01:40:20,420 --> 01:40:21,680
He turned into a potion.

1554
01:40:26,550 --> 01:40:28,510
Alright, now, where are- Oh, it's a birthday!

1555
01:40:31,870 --> 01:40:33,430
I'm playing a dragon D&D.

1556
01:40:33,570 --> 01:40:35,350
Anything- Absolutely can confirm.

1557
01:40:35,490 --> 01:40:38,190
Eating tourists solves all your issues.

1558
01:40:38,530 --> 01:40:41,090
Thank you for the super chat.

1559
01:40:41,350 --> 01:40:42,330
Thank you, thank you.

1560
01:40:43,430 --> 01:40:45,190
Alright, we got a candle.

1561
01:40:45,310 --> 01:40:49,670
Oh, we can- We can burn...

1562
01:40:49,670 --> 01:40:51,230
Burn the chocolate down.

1563
01:40:52,730 --> 01:40:54,010
Wait, there's music here.

1564
01:40:56,110 --> 01:40:56,770
That's right.

1565
01:40:56,970 --> 01:40:57,430
More cookies.

1566
01:40:58,410 --> 01:40:59,690
God, I'm too scared.

1567
01:41:00,230 --> 01:41:01,470
I walk so slow now.

1568
01:41:01,530 --> 01:41:02,710
Because I'm way too scared.

1569
01:41:04,510 --> 01:41:08,070
Wait, whose birthday was it?

1570
01:41:09,030 --> 01:41:11,030
Did I not get invited to a birthday party?

1571
01:41:13,510 --> 01:41:13,990
Alright.

1572
01:41:16,830 --> 01:41:20,230
Piglet's a weak- He's a weak, tiny pig.

1573
01:41:20,290 --> 01:41:21,730
He's not going to be able to eat the chocolate.

1574
01:41:21,730 --> 01:41:23,370
So he's going to burn the chocolate instead.

1575
01:41:24,550 --> 01:41:25,930
Alright, burn it down.

1576
01:41:29,010 --> 01:41:33,150
You know, this is actually like- I'm very surprised they added that.

1577
01:41:33,270 --> 01:41:35,530
Because I feel like a child will learn about this.

1578
01:41:38,650 --> 01:41:43,010
I feel like a child is going to try and do- Burn a door with a candle.

1579
01:41:44,330 --> 01:41:47,730
Turkey, please don't forget to collect the- Oracle gum.

1580
01:41:47,790 --> 01:41:49,830
So you can make piglets keep playing.

1581
01:41:49,830 --> 01:41:51,370
Thank you for the super chat.

1582
01:41:51,370 --> 01:41:51,970
Rabbit!

1583
01:41:52,270 --> 01:41:52,890
Dream Rabbit!

1584
01:42:04,770 --> 01:42:06,530
It's just one guy.

1585
01:42:10,430 --> 01:42:13,290
Fresh out in Winnie the Pooh's dream?

1586
01:42:19,830 --> 01:42:21,330
But it's quite dangerous, Piglet.

1587
01:42:21,550 --> 01:42:23,810
The bees won't let you near their honey.

1588
01:42:24,070 --> 01:42:27,910
Unless you find some way to get them away from their beehive.

1589
01:42:31,110 --> 01:42:32,630
How do we get them away?

1590
01:42:34,390 --> 01:42:35,930
Piglet, you need new friends.

1591
01:42:37,570 --> 01:42:38,990
You shouldn't have come back.

1592
01:42:39,390 --> 01:42:42,970
You shouldn't have- You shouldn't have come back after running away.

1593
01:42:47,430 --> 01:42:47,870
Alright.

1594
01:42:48,750 --> 01:42:50,910
I gotta get some advice from Christopher Robin.

1595
01:42:53,890 --> 01:42:54,330
Really?

1596
01:42:56,570 --> 01:42:57,610
Oh my god, really?

1597
01:42:57,690 --> 01:42:59,430
I can do anything if I believe in myself?

1598
01:43:01,070 --> 01:43:02,270
Oh my god.

1599
01:43:02,690 --> 01:43:03,890
What great advice.

1600
01:43:04,650 --> 01:43:05,850
Can you get the honey?

1601
01:43:06,130 --> 01:43:09,110
No, you just believe- Piglet, just believe in yourself.

1602
01:43:09,190 --> 01:43:10,910
And then you can grab the honey yourself.

1603
01:43:11,830 --> 01:43:12,950
Thanks, Christopher Robin.

1604
01:43:12,950 --> 01:43:13,570
Thanks, Christopher Robin.

1605
01:43:16,930 --> 01:43:20,470
True, that Zora looks weird.

1606
01:43:22,750 --> 01:43:24,470
Wait, what's behind me?

1607
01:43:24,650 --> 01:43:26,950
Wait, there was something behind me that could press.

1608
01:43:28,050 --> 01:43:29,670
Oh, there's the bees.

1609
01:43:34,230 --> 01:43:36,830
Wait, is that the- The woozles?

1610
01:43:39,090 --> 01:43:40,890
You can do anything.

1611
01:43:41,450 --> 01:43:42,590
What's this?

1612
01:43:42,590 --> 01:43:43,270
Oh, there's more.

1613
01:43:43,430 --> 01:43:44,850
Wait, those are upgrades.

1614
01:43:47,870 --> 01:43:49,750
I know, please upgrade my moves.

1615
01:43:50,770 --> 01:43:52,350
So I can scare them more.

1616
01:43:55,550 --> 01:43:56,350
I know.

1617
01:43:57,670 --> 01:44:00,710
Jesus Christ, that's actually freaking freakish.

1618
01:44:03,730 --> 01:44:06,290
It's like, let me break my jaw.

1619
01:44:06,390 --> 01:44:09,290
Let me unhinge my jaw real quick.

1620
01:44:09,290 --> 01:44:09,930
Real quick.

1621
01:44:10,390 --> 01:44:11,910
We got moves now.

1622
01:44:12,330 --> 01:44:14,430
We can unhinge our jaws like a snake.

1623
01:44:16,550 --> 01:44:20,610
Christopher Robin, the type of motherfucker who tells you to just stop being- That's what I thought!

1624
01:44:20,950 --> 01:44:22,610
That's what I was thinking too!

1625
01:44:22,850 --> 01:44:25,070
Thank you for the super chat.

1626
01:44:25,210 --> 01:44:26,190
Thank you, thank you.

1627
01:44:26,450 --> 01:44:29,350
He's like, he goes up to you and just be like, why are you sad?

1628
01:44:29,470 --> 01:44:30,770
Just stop being sad.

1629
01:44:31,130 --> 01:44:32,310
That's literally him.

1630
01:44:33,610 --> 01:44:35,190
Alright, let's scare this woozle.

1631
01:44:35,350 --> 01:44:36,250
Get over here, woozle.

1632
01:44:37,010 --> 01:44:38,110
That's fucking right.

1633
01:44:38,190 --> 01:44:38,710
Yeah.

1634
01:44:40,030 --> 01:44:42,990
I don't have children reflexes now.

1635
01:44:43,350 --> 01:44:44,650
That's right.

1636
01:44:47,950 --> 01:44:49,830
Turn into a fucking potion.

1637
01:44:51,130 --> 01:44:51,970
You're not real.

1638
01:44:53,430 --> 01:44:57,330
This is why I don't take my-

1639
01:45:00,510 --> 01:45:01,790
Oh, believe him.

1640
01:45:02,230 --> 01:45:05,110
Oh, Darcy, thank you for the super chat.

1641
01:45:05,110 --> 01:45:06,210
Thank you.

1642
01:45:06,390 --> 01:45:07,870
Oh, it's the raspberry!

1643
01:45:09,210 --> 01:45:10,470
He's real.

1644
01:45:10,750 --> 01:45:12,390
Get blasted.

1645
01:45:12,990 --> 01:45:16,950
Alright, this will make them want- They'll want berries over there.

1646
01:45:17,390 --> 01:45:17,930
Their queen.

1647
01:45:18,970 --> 01:45:19,610
Yes!

1648
01:45:20,770 --> 01:45:23,130
Leave your queen for berries!

1649
01:45:24,790 --> 01:45:26,950
Now I shall take all your honey.

1650
01:45:27,130 --> 01:45:28,750
And your children shall starve.

1651
01:45:30,710 --> 01:45:32,150
Not the bees.

1652
01:45:33,450 --> 01:45:34,730
Alright, let's go.

1653
01:45:36,510 --> 01:45:38,130
Rabbit could've done this.

1654
01:45:41,550 --> 01:45:46,930
Wait, I don't have a honeypot?

1655
01:45:48,430 --> 01:45:49,710
Wait, what?

1656
01:45:50,990 --> 01:45:57,370
They're not- Oh my god, I need to go back and get a honey- God fucking- Oh my- okay.

1657
01:45:58,030 --> 01:45:58,610
That's okay.

1658
01:45:59,030 --> 01:45:59,670
That's fine.

1659
01:45:59,670 --> 01:46:01,190
I can go back.

1660
01:46:01,670 --> 01:46:04,830
I can go back and grab a honeypot.

1661
01:46:05,410 --> 01:46:06,650
God damn, okay.

1662
01:46:06,890 --> 01:46:08,230
Maybe there's a honeypot here?

1663
01:46:08,850 --> 01:46:09,450
No.

1664
01:46:10,110 --> 01:46:11,630
Why didn't Rabbit tell me?

1665
01:46:12,370 --> 01:46:16,090
He could've told me before I went here!

1666
01:46:17,370 --> 01:46:19,770
Okay, Rabbit, I need a honeypot.

1667
01:46:22,610 --> 01:46:23,290
Languid.

1668
01:46:23,290 --> 01:46:23,690
Yeah.

1669
01:46:27,910 --> 01:46:30,790
We got the bees out.

1670
01:46:33,070 --> 01:46:33,550
I?

1671
01:46:36,150 --> 01:46:37,110
Yeah.

1672
01:46:39,790 --> 01:46:40,130
Oh.

1673
01:46:43,070 --> 01:46:44,150
Wait a minute.

1674
01:46:46,190 --> 01:46:46,670
Rabbit.

1675
01:46:47,730 --> 01:46:52,490
You're having a- Wait, was that Piglet's- Rabbit's birthday party?

1676
01:46:53,090 --> 01:46:54,610
Wait, that's sad.

1677
01:46:55,770 --> 01:46:58,110
Nobody came to your birthday?

1678
01:46:59,970 --> 01:47:01,130
That's so sad.

1679
01:47:01,330 --> 01:47:01,630
Wait,

1680
01:47:05,070 --> 01:47:05,310
what?

1681
01:47:05,470 --> 01:47:06,110
He's back?

1682
01:47:06,670 --> 01:47:09,810
I turned you into a fucking- I turned you into a potion!

1683
01:47:09,950 --> 01:47:10,630
Get over here!

1684
01:47:11,070 --> 01:47:12,210
Think I'm scared of you?

1685
01:47:13,010 --> 01:47:14,890
I'm not a child anymore!

1686
01:47:15,350 --> 01:47:17,130
I'm reflexes of an adult!

1687
01:47:17,830 --> 01:47:18,890
That's right!

1688
01:47:21,350 --> 01:47:23,110
Oh wait, it took more than one turn.

1689
01:47:24,190 --> 01:47:24,990
Alright, cry.

1690
01:47:28,950 --> 01:47:30,790
That's right, cry some more!

1691
01:47:31,030 --> 01:47:32,090
Turn into a potion!

1692
01:47:33,610 --> 01:47:35,550
Alright, I got a potion now.

1693
01:47:36,090 --> 01:47:36,490
Nice.

1694
01:47:36,690 --> 01:47:37,990
Wait, what do I do with the potions now?

1695
01:47:38,010 --> 01:47:38,790
Okay, I don't even know.

1696
01:47:39,270 --> 01:47:42,550
I don't know what to do with the potions.

1697
01:47:43,430 --> 01:47:43,910
That's right.

1698
01:47:45,650 --> 01:47:46,790
No, don't say that.

1699
01:47:46,870 --> 01:47:51,990
I wasn't born a pro- Don't say that, I was like- Wait, what?

1700
01:47:52,130 --> 01:47:52,830
Where is he?

1701
01:47:53,170 --> 01:47:54,890
Where even is he?

1702
01:47:56,070 --> 01:47:56,470
Okay.

1703
01:47:57,810 --> 01:48:00,910
Jesus Christ, when he unhinges his jaws.

1704
01:48:01,930 --> 01:48:03,230
That's so freaky.

1705
01:48:04,270 --> 01:48:05,650
The off-screen fight.

1706
01:48:05,750 --> 01:48:07,250
I was like, where did he come from?

1707
01:48:08,390 --> 01:48:09,770
Alright, got the key.

1708
01:48:11,930 --> 01:48:12,770
Unlock the door.

1709
01:48:18,150 --> 01:48:19,550
We could've used any other pot.

1710
01:48:22,490 --> 01:48:23,090
Alright.

1711
01:48:23,610 --> 01:48:24,950
Back to the pool bear.

1712
01:48:25,250 --> 01:48:26,390
Yay, auto-save!

1713
01:48:27,910 --> 01:48:28,210
Yay!

1714
01:48:30,690 --> 01:48:32,110
This is so sad.

1715
01:48:32,350 --> 01:48:33,750
This is actually so sad.

1716
01:48:34,450 --> 01:48:38,010
Rabbit was literally celebrating like...

1717
01:48:38,010 --> 01:48:40,170
her birthday by himself.

1718
01:48:42,650 --> 01:48:43,850
Also like...

1719
01:48:43,850 --> 01:48:45,870
Oh no, there's like Mother Rubear.

1720
01:48:47,090 --> 01:48:48,370
I wonder like...

1721
01:48:48,370 --> 01:48:49,290
Do they have jobs?

1722
01:48:50,150 --> 01:48:50,730
That's like...

1723
01:48:50,730 --> 01:48:52,670
I guess like...

1724
01:48:52,670 --> 01:48:57,970
Okay, to be fair, 100 Acre Woods is just Christopher Robin's delusions as a kid.

1725
01:48:58,570 --> 01:48:59,750
Like, those are like his...

1726
01:48:59,750 --> 01:49:04,110
Well, I wouldn't say delusions, because like he's a kid and he just has like a huge imagination.

1727
01:49:04,770 --> 01:49:05,330
But like...

1728
01:49:07,250 --> 01:49:08,710
Yeah, you know...

1729
01:49:08,710 --> 01:49:10,050
You know what I mean?

1730
01:49:10,090 --> 01:49:11,110
He's just...

1731
01:49:11,110 --> 01:49:13,090
He's just a very...

1732
01:49:13,090 --> 01:49:17,210
Very imaginative group...

1733
01:49:17,210 --> 01:49:18,590
Imaginative child.

1734
01:49:19,190 --> 01:49:21,090
He's just...

1735
01:49:26,240 --> 01:49:28,440
Yeah, it's like in his backyard.

1736
01:49:31,400 --> 01:49:32,800
Okay, there's...

1737
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:33,820
I got it.

1738
01:49:36,830 --> 01:49:38,270
No, they're not real.

1739
01:49:39,270 --> 01:49:40,170
But then like...

1740
01:49:40,170 --> 01:49:41,650
Okay, this is the weird part.

1741
01:49:42,110 --> 01:49:43,790
Because like...

1742
01:49:43,790 --> 01:49:45,910
The weird part is that...

1743
01:49:45,910 --> 01:49:46,690
Yay, we got Honey!

1744
01:49:48,110 --> 01:49:50,630
Christopher Robin coma theory.

1745
01:49:51,130 --> 01:49:52,490
Alright, thank you for the super chat.

1746
01:49:52,630 --> 01:49:53,630
Thank you, thank you.

1747
01:49:53,950 --> 01:49:56,070
To be fair, all the kids...

1748
01:49:56,070 --> 01:49:57,550
Like, all the fucking...

1749
01:49:57,550 --> 01:50:01,790
Theories regarding children cartoons is always about comas.

1750
01:50:02,310 --> 01:50:04,090
I feel like I don't need to fight them.

1751
01:50:04,510 --> 01:50:06,750
Like, I don't know what the potion actually does.

1752
01:50:08,110 --> 01:50:11,290
It's like when the VTubers click end stream button.

1753
01:50:11,290 --> 01:50:13,350
Darkblade, thank you for the super chat.

1754
01:50:13,410 --> 01:50:14,430
Thank you.

1755
01:50:15,610 --> 01:50:17,630
Okay, here we go.

1756
01:50:20,630 --> 01:50:24,390
It's like every child children show, the theory is like...

1757
01:50:25,010 --> 01:50:26,010
He's in a coma.

1758
01:50:26,490 --> 01:50:30,690
The reason why Ash is still 10 is because he's in a coma.

1759
01:50:31,110 --> 01:50:35,490
The reason why X is like that is because they're in a coma.

1760
01:50:35,730 --> 01:50:37,190
It's always a coma theory.

1761
01:50:40,150 --> 01:50:41,830
I literally don't need to fight them.

1762
01:50:42,370 --> 01:50:45,810
I don't remember what was the use of fighting them.

1763
01:50:46,570 --> 01:50:47,750
Oh my god, there's two.

1764
01:50:48,870 --> 01:50:50,010
Wait, there's no way.

1765
01:50:50,350 --> 01:50:51,830
There's no way they still fight me.

1766
01:50:53,010 --> 01:50:54,130
Oh shit, cookies.

1767
01:50:57,870 --> 01:51:04,510
I remember the live action for Winnie the Pooh where they actually become real.

1768
01:51:06,770 --> 01:51:07,390
Yeah.

1769
01:51:07,530 --> 01:51:09,490
Character X is actually dead.

1770
01:51:11,290 --> 01:51:11,770
I did.

1771
01:51:12,150 --> 01:51:12,870
There's the honey.

1772
01:51:16,270 --> 01:51:18,050
You could've had cotton candy.

1773
01:51:20,190 --> 01:51:21,190
Here you go.

1774
01:51:23,550 --> 01:51:26,150
Yeah, Ed and Eddie were actually in a coma.

1775
01:51:32,920 --> 01:51:34,500
No, not the...

1776
01:51:34,500 --> 01:51:37,620
I can't believe...

1777
01:51:37,620 --> 01:51:42,380
I can't believe you guys forgot the Disney live action.

1778
01:51:42,920 --> 01:51:47,640
To be fair, it's a Disney live action to be fair.

1779
01:51:48,160 --> 01:51:49,400
They're all forgettable.

1780
01:51:49,820 --> 01:51:53,100
But there was a Disney live action Winnie the Pooh movie.

1781
01:51:55,100 --> 01:51:56,960
We don't talk about that.

1782
01:51:57,740 --> 01:51:58,920
We did it!

1783
01:52:00,110 --> 01:52:01,180
We're heroes!

1784
01:52:01,180 --> 01:52:01,660
We're heroes!

1785
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:05,260
Oh my god, we're so brave!

1786
01:52:05,540 --> 01:52:06,580
We found honey!

1787
01:52:06,760 --> 01:52:07,900
We're so brave!

1788
01:52:18,520 --> 01:52:20,240
We saved the world.

1789
01:52:20,420 --> 01:52:22,080
We got Winnie the Pooh honey.

1790
01:52:23,300 --> 01:52:24,140
Look at us go.

1791
01:52:30,710 --> 01:52:32,330
I thought it was good.

1792
01:52:32,430 --> 01:52:34,530
But some of you guys forgot about it.

1793
01:52:36,490 --> 01:52:37,930
I personally thought it.

1794
01:52:37,990 --> 01:52:38,710
I cried.

1795
01:52:38,990 --> 01:52:40,350
I cried at the end.

1796
01:52:40,510 --> 01:52:42,150
To be fair, it's forgettable.

1797
01:52:44,030 --> 01:52:45,290
I'll say it.

1798
01:52:46,170 --> 01:52:48,230
I thought it was good.

1799
01:52:48,470 --> 01:52:50,450
And I cried at the ending.

1800
01:52:50,930 --> 01:52:53,950
But I don't remember what happened in the movie.

1801
01:52:54,210 --> 01:53:02,950
Other than the fact that Christopher Robin becomes an adult and then the people...

1802
01:53:02,950 --> 01:53:03,430
Oh wait, what?

1803
01:53:05,590 --> 01:53:06,530
Where's my...

1804
01:53:06,530 --> 01:53:09,090
His biggest nightmare, he lost his ball.

1805
01:53:09,430 --> 01:53:17,090
But like, all I remember was that Christopher Robin stopped going to Hundred Acre Wood because he thought it was just all in his head.

1806
01:53:17,370 --> 01:53:20,110
And then Winnie the Pooh was like, psych, I'm here!

1807
01:53:37,730 --> 01:53:41,490
Yeah, where did he...

1808
01:53:41,490 --> 01:53:42,350
I just got into...

1809
01:53:42,350 --> 01:53:43,430
I just incepted.

1810
01:53:46,750 --> 01:53:47,890
It's Christopher Robin.

1811
01:53:47,990 --> 01:53:49,270
I didn't watch Blood and Honey.

1812
01:53:49,690 --> 01:53:53,090
Because that's what happens every time a property...

1813
01:53:53,090 --> 01:53:54,810
Oh my god, this is a child's dream.

1814
01:53:54,930 --> 01:53:56,490
He has no concept of furniture.

1815
01:53:58,930 --> 01:53:59,810
He has...

1816
01:53:59,810 --> 01:54:00,670
He has no...

1817
01:54:00,670 --> 01:54:01,090
What the...

1818
01:54:01,090 --> 01:54:04,130
Why is fire in PPS concept of fire?

1819
01:54:04,830 --> 01:54:08,670
You gotta be careful with rude Mrs. Kanga.

1820
01:54:09,070 --> 01:54:12,390
He knows what fire is, but apparently not furniture.

1821
01:54:16,850 --> 01:54:19,270
That's not good, Mrs. Kanga.

1822
01:54:19,610 --> 01:54:21,370
He knows what this means.

1823
01:54:22,770 --> 01:54:25,330
What does Christopher Robin has to say to me now?

1824
01:54:35,280 --> 01:54:37,280
Oh my god, that's all he tells me.

1825
01:54:37,540 --> 01:54:39,620
Do not tell me anything new.

1826
01:54:44,940 --> 01:54:46,140
Thank you.

1827
01:54:47,080 --> 01:54:50,280
Yeah, I know like Christopher Robin was a natural kid.

1828
01:54:50,660 --> 01:54:54,820
He still had plushies of like some of his old plushies in the museum.

1829
01:54:55,300 --> 01:55:01,640
Even the grasses, cardboard, the water, everything is cardboard except for fire!

1830
01:55:01,640 --> 01:55:04,240
What's wrong with this child?

1831
01:55:07,900 --> 01:55:09,420
Thank you for the super chat.

1832
01:55:09,500 --> 01:55:09,760
Thank you.

1833
01:55:18,230 --> 01:55:19,370
Oh shit.

1834
01:55:19,470 --> 01:55:21,090
Even the water is not real!

1835
01:55:25,010 --> 01:55:25,970
Oh no.

1836
01:55:26,270 --> 01:55:31,230
Guys, I don't think Rue... I think Rue might be a pyromaniac.

1837
01:55:32,110 --> 01:55:32,790
Just maybe.

1838
01:55:33,850 --> 01:55:34,170
Okay.

1839
01:55:35,110 --> 01:55:35,850
That's right.

1840
01:55:36,190 --> 01:55:37,430
Reflexes of an adult.

1841
01:55:42,050 --> 01:55:42,610
Alright.

1842
01:55:42,750 --> 01:55:43,470
Let's get in.

1843
01:55:44,430 --> 01:55:45,750
Oh, there's something over here.

1844
01:55:46,090 --> 01:55:46,790
Is this real?

1845
01:55:47,530 --> 01:55:48,670
This isn't even real?

1846
01:55:49,590 --> 01:55:50,910
Is this cardboard a paint?

1847
01:55:52,730 --> 01:55:53,150
Okay.

1848
01:55:54,490 --> 01:55:55,650
Do the face.

1849
01:55:56,150 --> 01:55:57,330
Do the face, Piglet.

1850
01:55:57,510 --> 01:55:58,370
Do the face.

1851
01:55:58,890 --> 01:56:00,050
Get over here, Heffalump.

1852
01:56:00,930 --> 01:56:01,810
Get over here.

1853
01:56:02,630 --> 01:56:03,650
That's fucking right.

1854
01:56:03,710 --> 01:56:04,390
Get over here.

1855
01:56:05,430 --> 01:56:13,310
I just need you guys to know, my reflexes were so slow back then that I have failed this combat and have died.

1856
01:56:13,570 --> 01:56:15,750
I've actually died.

1857
01:56:15,950 --> 01:56:20,950
I remember dying in some of the combat.

1858
01:56:23,850 --> 01:56:24,590
Yes.

1859
01:56:29,570 --> 01:56:30,680
Is anything...

1860
01:56:31,050 --> 01:56:33,070
Is there no... Is everything cardboard?

1861
01:56:33,690 --> 01:56:35,630
Is there anything that's not cardboard?

1862
01:56:36,810 --> 01:56:38,010
Are you cardboard?

1863
01:56:38,690 --> 01:56:39,690
Oh, there's a rock.

1864
01:56:39,790 --> 01:56:41,630
What if I paint the rock into a different color?

1865
01:56:44,230 --> 01:56:44,690
Oh,

1866
01:56:49,610 --> 01:56:49,830
okay.

1867
01:56:49,890 --> 01:56:50,550
So not that.

1868
01:56:50,810 --> 01:56:51,150
Okay.

1869
01:56:51,310 --> 01:56:53,370
No, he's just gonna be like, stop being sad.

1870
01:56:55,330 --> 01:56:56,770
I don't think that's you.

1871
01:56:56,830 --> 01:56:56,950
Oh!

1872
01:56:57,790 --> 01:56:58,250
Tigger!

1873
01:56:58,250 --> 01:56:58,730
Tigger!

1874
01:56:59,990 --> 01:57:03,110
The wonderful thing about Tigger is Tigger's a wonderful thing.

1875
01:57:06,970 --> 01:57:07,870
Break it!

1876
01:57:08,290 --> 01:57:09,290
It's paper!

1877
01:57:13,370 --> 01:57:16,370
Oh yeah, it's all about the Popeye horror film.

1878
01:57:16,470 --> 01:57:16,870
Lurkerosis.

1879
01:57:23,450 --> 01:57:24,490
Just jump!

1880
01:57:24,670 --> 01:57:25,790
You're literally...

1881
01:57:25,790 --> 01:57:26,990
Everything about you is jumping!

1882
01:57:52,010 --> 01:57:54,830
I don't think he's gonna take care of it, guys.

1883
01:57:55,930 --> 01:57:57,070
Wait, I'm playing...

1884
01:57:57,070 --> 01:57:58,990
I get to play the best character!

1885
01:58:00,170 --> 01:58:03,650
Alright, this is Tigger's big dream now.

1886
01:58:04,830 --> 01:58:05,390
No!

1887
01:58:06,110 --> 01:58:07,610
But I have to sneak!

1888
01:58:08,150 --> 01:58:09,570
Oh my god, he's not gonna know.

1889
01:58:09,890 --> 01:58:11,050
He's not gonna know.

1890
01:58:11,130 --> 01:58:12,070
How would he know?

1891
01:58:12,550 --> 01:58:13,890
How would he know?

1892
01:58:14,310 --> 01:58:15,170
I'll just run.

1893
01:58:17,490 --> 01:58:18,770
How would he know?

1894
01:58:20,370 --> 01:58:22,770
The fastest sneaking around.

1895
01:58:24,310 --> 01:58:26,170
Self-mission done.

1896
01:58:26,550 --> 01:58:27,170
Completed.

1897
01:58:28,890 --> 01:58:30,470
Wait, no, what do you mean?

1898
01:58:30,550 --> 01:58:31,170
I literally...

1899
01:58:31,170 --> 01:58:31,890
I did it!

1900
01:58:33,530 --> 01:58:35,570
How are they gonna catch me?

1901
01:58:35,950 --> 01:58:37,310
How are they gonna catch me?

1902
01:58:37,450 --> 01:58:38,570
They don't know, see?

1903
01:58:39,050 --> 01:58:39,870
Look at that!

1904
01:58:40,990 --> 01:58:42,230
Turn around!

1905
01:58:43,730 --> 01:58:44,510
Oh, please!

1906
01:58:45,090 --> 01:58:46,290
Turn around!

1907
01:58:46,630 --> 01:58:47,510
Oh, thank god.

1908
01:58:47,610 --> 01:58:47,810
Okay.

1909
01:58:48,670 --> 01:58:49,130
See?

1910
01:58:49,330 --> 01:58:49,980
It's so easy.

1911
01:58:50,910 --> 01:58:52,130
Wait, then where do I go?

1912
01:58:52,370 --> 01:58:53,570
Oh, I guess I go this way.

1913
01:58:55,350 --> 01:58:55,810
Ah!

1914
01:58:55,930 --> 01:58:56,190
No!

1915
01:58:56,810 --> 01:58:57,690
No, no, I'm scared!

1916
01:58:57,790 --> 01:58:59,670
No, Tigger, why are you scared?!

1917
01:58:59,670 --> 01:59:00,230
No!

1918
01:59:00,510 --> 01:59:01,630
You're a fucking coward!

1919
01:59:04,170 --> 01:59:04,630
No!

1920
01:59:06,510 --> 01:59:06,970
God.

1921
01:59:10,530 --> 01:59:11,670
How did he know?

1922
01:59:11,930 --> 01:59:13,390
Was it my sound effects?

1923
01:59:13,390 --> 01:59:13,550
Yes!

1924
01:59:17,510 --> 01:59:18,110
MTS.

1925
01:59:19,150 --> 01:59:20,050
I don't understand!

1926
01:59:20,630 --> 01:59:22,910
Sorry, I was a little bitch, Piglet.

1927
01:59:30,270 --> 01:59:30,870
Yeah!

1928
01:59:34,570 --> 01:59:36,010
You should've been there, Piglet!

1929
01:59:39,530 --> 01:59:40,570
Oh my god.

1930
01:59:43,470 --> 01:59:45,630
Oh my god, you should've been there!

1931
01:59:51,970 --> 01:59:53,610
Alright, Zero, thank you for the super chat!

1932
01:59:53,730 --> 01:59:54,150
Thank you, thank you!

1933
01:59:54,150 --> 02:00:00,570
My friend is playing this game with an Xbox controller but it's giving him GameCube quicktime events.

1934
02:00:00,890 --> 02:00:01,990
Okay, I figured it out.

1935
02:00:02,830 --> 02:00:04,270
I figured it out, guys.

1936
02:00:04,810 --> 02:00:06,870
Okay, we got this part down.

1937
02:00:07,610 --> 02:00:10,150
We got this part down very easily.

1938
02:00:12,370 --> 02:00:12,890
Alright.

1939
02:00:14,130 --> 02:00:15,410
He's not- That's what I'm saying.

1940
02:00:15,470 --> 02:00:20,650
I think Piglet has a really bad- I think Piglet just has really bad friends in general.

1941
02:00:23,030 --> 02:00:24,510
What does this do?

1942
02:00:24,890 --> 02:00:25,410
Oh!

1943
02:00:25,950 --> 02:00:28,530
I would've failed it anyway because I didn't do this.

1944
02:00:29,470 --> 02:00:32,950
I like how it's like a picture book.

1945
02:00:33,890 --> 02:00:34,410
Okay.

1946
02:00:35,830 --> 02:00:36,970
He won't know.

1947
02:00:37,370 --> 02:00:38,350
He's gonna turn around.

1948
02:00:40,510 --> 02:00:43,270
Oh my god, there's like music while I'm sneaking!

1949
02:00:44,170 --> 02:00:45,390
Oh, that's so cute!

1950
02:00:46,490 --> 02:00:50,510
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

1951
02:00:51,230 --> 02:00:56,810
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

1952
02:00:57,730 --> 02:00:58,690
Can I make it across?

1953
02:00:58,810 --> 02:00:59,390
I think I can.

1954
02:01:00,990 --> 02:01:02,390
Boop, boop.

1955
02:01:03,670 --> 02:01:04,430
I think I can.

1956
02:01:04,590 --> 02:01:04,850
Okay.

1957
02:01:06,090 --> 02:01:08,150
Okay, there's no way they'll know, right?

1958
02:01:08,150 --> 02:01:08,730
From here?

1959
02:01:09,930 --> 02:01:10,730
There's no way.

1960
02:01:12,590 --> 02:01:14,330
No way, I'm like so far away.

1961
02:01:15,190 --> 02:01:16,650
No way, he's not gonna turn around.

1962
02:01:17,870 --> 02:01:19,790
It's just gonna be like...

1963
02:01:20,930 --> 02:01:21,370
Okay.

1964
02:01:21,630 --> 02:01:22,450
Yes, we did it.

1965
02:01:24,150 --> 02:01:24,930
We did it.

1966
02:01:25,150 --> 02:01:26,150
Okay, now we bounce.

1967
02:01:27,150 --> 02:01:28,150
Yeah, how would they know?

1968
02:01:28,210 --> 02:01:28,970
We're so selfie.

1969
02:01:30,750 --> 02:01:31,630
So easy.

1970
02:01:32,870 --> 02:01:33,410
Hahaha.

1971
02:01:36,690 --> 02:01:37,730
So safe.

1972
02:01:38,790 --> 02:01:39,610
You know what?

1973
02:01:39,690 --> 02:01:40,870
No, Tigger is like...

1974
02:01:40,870 --> 02:01:43,290
He's a bigger coward than Piglet somehow.

1975
02:01:44,750 --> 02:01:45,330
Look at that.

1976
02:01:45,490 --> 02:01:46,750
Piglet, you should've seen it.

1977
02:01:47,210 --> 02:01:51,810
There was like 500 Hufflepuffs and like 5,000 Wizzles.

1978
02:01:55,390 --> 02:01:56,390
Oh my god.

1979
02:01:56,490 --> 02:01:57,710
You should've been there, Piglet.

1980
02:01:57,990 --> 02:01:58,730
That's crazy.

1981
02:01:59,770 --> 02:02:00,590
Where did he go?

1982
02:02:00,590 --> 02:02:02,390
And he never came back down.

1983
02:02:02,830 --> 02:02:03,510
Wait.

1984
02:02:04,230 --> 02:02:06,130
He went back up and he was gone.

1985
02:02:10,960 --> 02:02:12,480
Alright, look at me.

1986
02:02:13,340 --> 02:02:14,340
Look at me!

1987
02:02:15,740 --> 02:02:17,020
Look at me!

1988
02:02:17,240 --> 02:02:18,140
That's fucking right.

1989
02:02:18,960 --> 02:02:20,020
Fight me!

1990
02:02:21,700 --> 02:02:23,280
Bro, he ascended.

1991
02:02:24,200 --> 02:02:25,640
That's fucking right.

1992
02:02:26,640 --> 02:02:26,980
Cry!

1993
02:02:31,460 --> 02:02:33,820
He's with his people now.

1994
02:02:34,340 --> 02:02:35,340
His people needs him.

1995
02:02:37,600 --> 02:02:39,740
We gotta go back here.

1996
02:02:42,920 --> 02:02:45,080
Now I shall kill all the Hufflepuffs.

1997
02:02:45,480 --> 02:02:46,080
It's okay.

1998
02:02:46,180 --> 02:02:47,400
Hufflepuffs don't have rights.

1999
02:02:47,480 --> 02:02:48,040
They're not real.

2000
02:02:48,760 --> 02:02:52,080
They're actually in your mind.

2001
02:02:56,470 --> 02:02:58,110
Oh, I have enough money.

2002
02:02:59,670 --> 02:03:02,510
NPCs hears comically loud spring noise behind them.

2003
02:03:02,510 --> 02:03:03,570
It must be wind.

2004
02:03:03,870 --> 02:03:05,230
Wait, I don't have money?

2005
02:03:06,210 --> 02:03:07,930
How much is it?

2006
02:03:08,690 --> 02:03:11,270
Piglet must buy all brave faces?

2007
02:03:11,910 --> 02:03:13,470
Okay, give me cookies now.

2008
02:03:15,290 --> 02:03:16,290
How much do I have?

2009
02:03:16,430 --> 02:03:17,130
I have 16!

2010
02:03:17,230 --> 02:03:18,150
Oh my god, okay.

2011
02:03:18,330 --> 02:03:19,290
We gotta save up.

2012
02:03:19,790 --> 02:03:20,630
I'm broke.

2013
02:03:21,410 --> 02:03:23,210
I didn't even realize I was broke.

2014
02:03:24,230 --> 02:03:26,070
Okay, we gotta farm some cookies.

2015
02:03:26,970 --> 02:03:36,230
The reason why we need more faces is that the attacks get stronger and the Hufflepuffs get stronger too.

2016
02:03:36,990 --> 02:03:38,470
I need so much money.

2017
02:03:43,030 --> 02:03:43,810
Guys,

2018
02:03:48,270 --> 02:03:53,590
it is a little concerning that the only real thing in this world was literally the fire.

2019
02:03:55,050 --> 02:03:57,910
It's very concerning for Rue.

2020
02:04:00,090 --> 02:04:00,730
Okay.

2021
02:04:01,850 --> 02:04:02,870
Get out.

2022
02:04:04,370 --> 02:04:05,850
Cry to your mama.

2023
02:04:09,030 --> 02:04:11,090
Pull the trigger, Piglet.

2024
02:04:12,010 --> 02:04:13,290
That's right, cry.

2025
02:04:16,290 --> 02:04:17,150
Oh, that's true.

2026
02:04:17,170 --> 02:04:17,930
The mom was real.

2027
02:04:18,070 --> 02:04:19,730
The mom and Tigger were real.

2028
02:04:21,590 --> 02:04:24,390
Those were the realest things in his entire dream.

2029
02:04:25,190 --> 02:04:27,010
And I guess the ball too.

2030
02:04:27,730 --> 02:04:30,270
So the important things in his life.

2031
02:04:32,190 --> 02:04:33,830
Okay, is there anything else I can kick?

2032
02:04:33,930 --> 02:04:34,870
Can I kick Rue's mailbox?

2033
02:04:35,810 --> 02:04:36,470
No, okay.

2034
02:04:36,830 --> 02:04:37,190
Rue!

2035
02:04:37,430 --> 02:04:38,650
Come out here, Rue!

2036
02:04:46,960 --> 02:04:50,240
Your mama, your dream mama is worried about you.

2037
02:04:56,450 --> 02:04:57,630
Just kick it.

2038
02:05:04,990 --> 02:05:06,690
Isn't this your house, Rue?

2039
02:05:09,330 --> 02:05:10,490
Get out of here.

2040
02:05:11,350 --> 02:05:12,290
I need a stronger move.

2041
02:05:12,390 --> 02:05:13,990
I definitely need 70 cookies.

2042
02:05:16,490 --> 02:05:18,450
Unhinge that jaw now, Piglet.

2043
02:05:19,730 --> 02:05:23,410
Oh yeah, they made a live action Popeye horror film.

2044
02:05:24,230 --> 02:05:25,890
How are you still alive?

2045
02:05:25,990 --> 02:05:26,190
Okay.

2046
02:05:26,690 --> 02:05:27,750
Eat the door.

2047
02:05:30,290 --> 02:05:31,770
Piglet can't eat chocolate.

2048
02:05:31,770 --> 02:05:34,110
Piglet, you think he can eat fucking paper?

2049
02:05:35,450 --> 02:05:37,710
Even Pooh wouldn't fucking eat the chocolate.

2050
02:05:38,150 --> 02:05:39,910
He wouldn't even eat cotton candy.

2051
02:05:44,020 --> 02:05:45,740
Alright, we gotta go back.

2052
02:05:46,700 --> 02:05:48,780
Well, I'll go back and grab...

2053
02:05:48,780 --> 02:05:52,320
go back to Mrs. Kanga's place.

2054
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:54,480
That's true, pigs do eat anything.

2055
02:05:55,520 --> 02:05:56,680
Pigs don't care.

2056
02:05:57,260 --> 02:05:58,080
Except for Piglet.

2057
02:05:58,900 --> 02:05:59,580
He's a coward?

2058
02:05:59,860 --> 02:06:00,160
Okay.

2059
02:06:03,420 --> 02:06:04,860
Not this Piglet.

2060
02:06:05,540 --> 02:06:07,940
This Piglet's a fucking man.

2061
02:06:09,160 --> 02:06:09,840
What's this?

2062
02:06:11,540 --> 02:06:12,080
What did I grab?

2063
02:06:16,940 --> 02:06:17,460
What?

2064
02:06:18,140 --> 02:06:19,780
This entire place is cardboard.

2065
02:06:19,920 --> 02:06:21,160
What the fuck do you mean?

2066
02:06:22,700 --> 02:06:23,220
Like...

2067
02:06:23,220 --> 02:06:25,420
Dory, thank you for the super chat.

2068
02:06:25,520 --> 02:06:26,400
Thank you, thank you.

2069
02:06:26,500 --> 02:06:30,100
Rue moved out of his mom's house before I did.

2070
02:06:30,100 --> 02:06:33,340
What am I doing in my life?

2071
02:06:33,740 --> 02:06:34,740
Thank you for the super chat.

2072
02:06:34,800 --> 02:06:39,660
To be fair, I'm pretty sure rent here is like...

2073
02:06:39,660 --> 02:06:43,740
Okay, rent here compared to what rent we have to get?

2074
02:06:44,620 --> 02:06:45,120
Like...

2075
02:06:48,860 --> 02:06:52,980
Pretty sure in 100 acres wood, the rent is not as bad as like us.

2076
02:06:53,820 --> 02:06:54,940
Dory, thank you for the super chat.

2077
02:06:55,060 --> 02:06:55,940
Thank you.

2078
02:06:56,680 --> 02:07:02,180
Funny enough, Tigger is said to have ADHD, but exhibits PTSD for... PTSD of what?

2079
02:07:03,380 --> 02:07:05,340
The Great Fucking Tigger War?

2080
02:07:10,230 --> 02:07:13,030
Yeah, just kicking stuff because I need cookies.

2081
02:07:13,630 --> 02:07:15,250
Give me cookies.

2082
02:07:16,510 --> 02:07:18,430
The Great Tigger War.

2083
02:07:24,100 --> 02:07:25,680
Oh shit, oh shit.

2084
02:07:26,560 --> 02:07:27,640
Okay, that was close.

2085
02:07:27,880 --> 02:07:29,280
I was literally right behind him.

2086
02:07:30,360 --> 02:07:31,480
I have the reflexes.

2087
02:07:34,480 --> 02:07:35,620
That's right.

2088
02:07:35,680 --> 02:07:36,880
My saliva.

2089
02:07:37,240 --> 02:07:37,920
Be afraid.

2090
02:07:38,540 --> 02:07:40,040
Be very afraid.

2091
02:07:42,080 --> 02:07:44,980
The Great War versus Tony the Tiger.

2092
02:07:49,660 --> 02:07:52,500
Alright, I think I can like run past these guys.

2093
02:07:52,660 --> 02:07:53,800
I don't... Okay, nevermind.

2094
02:07:54,320 --> 02:07:56,380
Nevermind, he was seeing red.

2095
02:07:57,020 --> 02:07:57,900
I got a little afraid.

2096
02:08:01,650 --> 02:08:02,630
That's right.

2097
02:08:02,950 --> 02:08:04,390
Be afraid.

2098
02:08:05,330 --> 02:08:06,690
It's not six...

2099
02:08:06,690 --> 02:08:10,150
Oh, I'm spitting at you and I'm not doing it within six feet.

2100
02:08:10,230 --> 02:08:11,630
I'm doing it within six feet.

2101
02:08:11,870 --> 02:08:13,150
Be very afraid.

2102
02:08:14,090 --> 02:08:14,970
There's more?

2103
02:08:15,250 --> 02:08:16,590
Oh no, that's not more Hufflelumps.

2104
02:08:16,650 --> 02:08:17,730
I thought there was more Hufflelumps.

2105
02:08:19,090 --> 02:08:20,110
Alright, let's go.

2106
02:08:22,750 --> 02:08:23,990
Yeah, the red is an acorn.

2107
02:08:24,690 --> 02:08:25,890
That's so true.

2108
02:08:26,570 --> 02:08:27,730
Thank you for the super chat.

2109
02:08:27,810 --> 02:08:28,710
Thank you.

2110
02:08:30,470 --> 02:08:30,910
Alright.

2111
02:08:31,470 --> 02:08:32,370
Miss Kanga.

2112
02:08:34,390 --> 02:08:35,990
I did!

2113
02:08:57,810 --> 02:09:00,250
On the floor?

2114
02:09:00,250 --> 02:09:00,270
What?

2115
02:09:02,630 --> 02:09:04,430
Wait, I have a lot of cookies.

2116
02:09:14,690 --> 02:09:17,330
That's like mom talk for like don't come back.

2117
02:09:18,570 --> 02:09:21,930
Don't come back until mom has her mom time.

2118
02:09:25,830 --> 02:09:28,970
Don't come back until mom has her mom time.

2119
02:09:31,770 --> 02:09:32,970
Oh, man.

2120
02:09:33,330 --> 02:09:36,610
I didn't even start looking for the key.

2121
02:09:37,750 --> 02:09:38,990
Oh, man.

2122
02:09:40,130 --> 02:09:44,770
Mama Kanga still hasn't finished her wine yet.

2123
02:09:45,330 --> 02:09:48,130
Come back when this wine is empty.

2124
02:09:50,370 --> 02:09:52,350
Okay, that should be enough, right?

2125
02:09:53,590 --> 02:09:54,470
Mrs. Kanga?

2126
02:09:54,630 --> 02:09:55,710
Where's Mr. Kanga?

2127
02:09:55,710 --> 02:09:55,930
Yeah.

2128
02:09:59,290 --> 02:10:00,570
Wow!

2129
02:10:03,710 --> 02:10:06,310
There's so many cookies!

2130
02:10:07,730 --> 02:10:12,670
Why don't you go outside and find more cookies?

2131
02:10:17,430 --> 02:10:19,250
Oh, my god!

2132
02:10:19,730 --> 02:10:21,770
Yes, there's more cookies!

2133
02:10:25,710 --> 02:10:27,550
I've never heard about Mr. Kanga.

2134
02:10:32,930 --> 02:10:34,550
Oh, my god!

2135
02:10:35,410 --> 02:10:36,110
Oh, my god!

2136
02:10:36,410 --> 02:10:37,390
How many cookies?

2137
02:10:37,530 --> 02:10:38,210
Oh, there's more.

2138
02:10:39,350 --> 02:10:40,650
Yes, there's more.

2139
02:10:45,020 --> 02:10:46,240
Wait, you're right!

2140
02:10:51,260 --> 02:10:53,000
Wait, that's a lie!

2141
02:10:53,780 --> 02:10:55,300
That song was a lie!

2142
02:10:55,600 --> 02:10:56,740
Wait, no, he was the only one.

2143
02:10:56,740 --> 02:10:57,200
I don't remember.

2144
02:10:58,120 --> 02:10:59,060
Oh, no!

2145
02:10:59,300 --> 02:10:59,720
Oh, wait!

2146
02:10:59,800 --> 02:11:01,380
No, it's not a lie!

2147
02:11:01,720 --> 02:11:02,860
I remember now!

2148
02:11:02,980 --> 02:11:03,860
It's really sad.

2149
02:11:04,140 --> 02:11:10,480
He, like, thinks he has, like, a family, and he makes up in his own head about all the different family members he has.

2150
02:11:10,620 --> 02:11:14,620
So, like, in his own head, he thinks he has, like, a lot of different families.

2151
02:11:15,180 --> 02:11:16,480
Family members and stuff.

2152
02:11:16,520 --> 02:11:28,360
I never watched the movie, but I had, like, a picture book of, like, you know, like, the old golden illustration books as, like, for kids.

2153
02:11:28,420 --> 02:11:29,760
They don't do that anymore.

2154
02:11:30,060 --> 02:11:30,780
But I remember...

2155
02:11:30,780 --> 02:11:31,600
How?

2156
02:11:32,300 --> 02:11:32,780
How?!

2157
02:11:32,780 --> 02:11:34,120
I kicked everything!

2158
02:11:34,820 --> 02:11:35,300
There's...

2159
02:11:36,480 --> 02:11:39,140
What have I not kicked?!

2160
02:11:39,140 --> 02:11:49,860
But in, like, in the old times, they would have these, like, books, like, illustrated books and stuff that's, like, different, like, actual, like, illustrations, so they don't grab screenshots from the movies.

2161
02:11:50,460 --> 02:11:52,920
And, um, I used to have one...

2162
02:11:52,920 --> 02:12:01,200
Like, I had a collection of those and one of the store... Like, it was, like, those, like, giant books, and I had a collection of those because my parents would buy them for me to read.

2163
02:12:01,540 --> 02:12:05,420
And, like, one of them was, like, the that had an illustration of the Tigger movie.

2164
02:12:06,940 --> 02:12:16,400
So, like, he would, he would, like, brag about how he has, like, a million different family members and what each family member does, but then we found out that he's literally, like, alone.

2165
02:12:17,120 --> 02:12:18,140
He has no family.

2166
02:12:18,740 --> 02:12:20,800
Which is, like...

2167
02:12:20,800 --> 02:12:22,160
To be fair, he's not special.

2168
02:12:22,740 --> 02:12:25,300
Because Piglet has no family, but you don't see...

2169
02:12:25,300 --> 02:12:26,920
Okay, to be fair...

2170
02:12:26,920 --> 02:12:28,560
No, not just Eeyore...

2171
02:12:28,560 --> 02:12:30,880
We're talking about, like...

2172
02:12:31,420 --> 02:12:32,840
Who has it worse?

2173
02:12:33,440 --> 02:12:35,260
Jokey, this is not a competition.

2174
02:12:40,360 --> 02:12:42,400
Jokey, this is not a competition.

2175
02:12:42,620 --> 02:12:42,760
Jokey, this is not a competition.

2176
02:12:42,760 --> 02:12:42,780
Jokey, this is not a competition.

2177
02:12:42,780 --> 02:12:42,860
Jokey, this is not a competition.

2178
02:12:43,360 --> 02:12:43,800
But...

2179
02:12:43,800 --> 02:12:45,060
Who has it worse?

2180
02:12:45,160 --> 02:12:48,180
I'd say Eeyore has it the worst out of everybody.

2181
02:12:48,180 --> 02:12:48,620
Like...

2182
02:12:55,240 --> 02:12:56,680
Orphan, like...

2183
02:12:56,680 --> 02:12:59,160
The trauma dump face.

2184
02:13:01,060 --> 02:13:07,560
Yeah, at least Christopher Robin doesn't fucking pull out next to Tigger and was like, just stop being sad.

2185
02:13:08,660 --> 02:13:08,960
What?

2186
02:13:09,180 --> 02:13:09,580
What?

2187
02:13:09,880 --> 02:13:11,520
What have I not kicked?

2188
02:13:11,800 --> 02:13:12,600
Miss Gengar!

2189
02:13:13,240 --> 02:13:14,200
I kicked this!

2190
02:13:14,720 --> 02:13:15,980
I kicked that!

2191
02:13:15,980 --> 02:13:17,780
I kicked this!

2192
02:13:18,440 --> 02:13:19,640
I kicked that!

2193
02:13:20,300 --> 02:13:22,620
What do you want from me?

2194
02:13:23,300 --> 02:13:24,700
I kicked everything!

2195
02:13:27,500 --> 02:13:30,040
And Eeyore is like...

2196
02:13:30,040 --> 02:13:32,400
Well, to be fair, Rabbit doesn't have his own movie too.

2197
02:13:32,500 --> 02:13:33,640
Is Rabbit Eeyore?

2198
02:13:33,760 --> 02:13:36,440
That's never had their... Oh my god, it's these two.

2199
02:13:37,580 --> 02:13:38,140
Like...

2200
02:13:38,140 --> 02:13:39,260
There we go.

2201
02:13:39,320 --> 02:13:40,980
Now we should have got everything.

2202
02:13:42,380 --> 02:13:43,480
I haven't found the key.

2203
02:13:43,480 --> 02:13:43,980
What?

2204
02:13:44,160 --> 02:13:44,940
I'm gonna kick you.

2205
02:13:45,220 --> 02:13:46,140
I'm gonna...

2206
02:13:48,300 --> 02:13:50,020
What else do you want me to kick?

2207
02:13:51,120 --> 02:13:52,620
I kicked everything!

2208
02:13:53,300 --> 02:13:53,860
I...

2209
02:13:59,700 --> 02:14:01,000
Oh my god.

2210
02:14:01,060 --> 02:14:01,800
Okay, Owl.

2211
02:14:01,920 --> 02:14:03,860
Owl and Eeyore have no movies.

2212
02:14:04,840 --> 02:14:06,260
Oh my god.

2213
02:14:07,300 --> 02:14:09,560
She's just like, stop bothering mom hours.

2214
02:14:11,200 --> 02:14:14,020
She's just like, stay outside for two more hours.

2215
02:14:14,160 --> 02:14:15,260
This is mom time.

2216
02:14:17,160 --> 02:14:18,700
This is true mom hours.

2217
02:14:19,380 --> 02:14:20,860
It's mom core right there.

2218
02:14:22,440 --> 02:14:22,880
Okay.

2219
02:14:23,940 --> 02:14:25,040
Let's see.

2220
02:14:26,060 --> 02:14:27,180
I'm gonna kick everything.

2221
02:14:28,260 --> 02:14:28,920
I'm gonna...

2222
02:14:28,920 --> 02:14:29,280
Ugh!

2223
02:14:29,940 --> 02:14:31,300
I'm so mad!

2224
02:14:31,560 --> 02:14:36,180
I'm so fucking mad!

2225
02:14:37,780 --> 02:14:40,480
Alright, at least I can afford a face now.

2226
02:14:41,940 --> 02:14:44,480
Like, how much does she want me to collect?

2227
02:14:52,570 --> 02:14:53,650
Is it this?

2228
02:14:57,110 --> 02:14:58,410
Nothing works!

2229
02:14:58,770 --> 02:15:00,650
I can't even kick the rock!

2230
02:15:03,830 --> 02:15:04,510
Ugh!

2231
02:15:08,150 --> 02:15:09,770
I can't believe it.

2232
02:15:10,550 --> 02:15:11,950
They won't let me kick this.

2233
02:15:13,030 --> 02:15:14,930
They won't let me kick this!

2234
02:15:15,910 --> 02:15:19,430
She wants me to play outside for 20 more years!

2235
02:15:23,640 --> 02:15:26,180
Amateur, thank you for the very first super...

2236
02:15:26,180 --> 02:15:28,020
Your very first super chat!

2237
02:15:28,360 --> 02:15:31,420
Mr. Kanga died in the great Tigger war.

2238
02:15:31,780 --> 02:15:33,740
He was on the opposite side.

2239
02:15:36,400 --> 02:15:40,600
Have you ever noticed that Miss Kanga and Tigger don't like...

2240
02:15:40,600 --> 02:15:42,380
That Miss Kanga doesn't like Tigger?

2241
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:44,160
And thinks he's a nuisance?

2242
02:15:44,160 --> 02:15:45,320
Now we know why.

2243
02:15:46,220 --> 02:15:47,400
I'm so mad.

2244
02:15:47,560 --> 02:15:48,780
I'm so fucking mad.

2245
02:15:48,860 --> 02:15:51,600
I'll never... Like, does she want me to collect every cookie?

2246
02:15:52,780 --> 02:15:55,120
Does she want me to collect everything?

2247
02:15:57,420 --> 02:16:07,840
It's like that, uh... that video of Mickey and Goofy, and then Goofy was like, Gosh, take the shot, Mickey!

2248
02:16:10,900 --> 02:16:12,900
Just take the shot!

2249
02:16:17,120 --> 02:16:18,120
That's what...

2250
02:16:18,120 --> 02:16:21,740
That's basically Tigger and Mr. Kanga.

2251
02:16:24,660 --> 02:16:26,640
Gosh, Mickey, do it!

2252
02:16:28,840 --> 02:16:33,240
Don't make me choose between you and my country, Goofy!

2253
02:16:33,860 --> 02:16:34,180
Uh-huh!

2254
02:16:35,760 --> 02:16:36,540
It's a great video.

2255
02:16:36,840 --> 02:16:39,600
That video lives rent-free in my head.

2256
02:16:40,200 --> 02:16:40,640
Honestly.

2257
02:16:43,540 --> 02:16:43,980
What?

2258
02:16:44,080 --> 02:16:45,460
You guys never heard of that?

2259
02:16:45,680 --> 02:16:47,960
You guys never heard of that video before?

2260
02:16:49,900 --> 02:16:50,700
It's so good.

2261
02:16:52,760 --> 02:16:53,700
Do it, Mickey!

2262
02:16:55,500 --> 02:16:57,100
Okay, wait, let me grab the link.

2263
02:16:58,700 --> 02:16:59,740
No, you guys can...

2264
02:16:59,740 --> 02:17:00,740
Actually, no, just YouTube.

2265
02:17:01,940 --> 02:17:02,380
Um...

2266
02:17:03,640 --> 02:17:07,040
Somebody just give them the title and then they can YouTube it.

2267
02:17:11,060 --> 02:17:12,260
Alright, at least we...

2268
02:17:12,260 --> 02:17:13,900
If I finally buy a face.

2269
02:17:16,320 --> 02:17:17,740
What face am I gonna get?

2270
02:17:21,800 --> 02:17:22,820
Oh, nice!

2271
02:17:27,480 --> 02:17:28,020
Shark!

2272
02:17:28,540 --> 02:17:29,640
Thank you for the super chat!

2273
02:17:29,800 --> 02:17:30,720
Thank you, thank you!

2274
02:17:31,440 --> 02:17:35,160
Tigger came to 100 Acre Woods to make peace with Mr. Kanga.

2275
02:17:35,460 --> 02:17:37,140
Oh, no!

2276
02:17:38,500 --> 02:17:41,520
That's why he showed up later in the movie!

2277
02:17:41,520 --> 02:17:42,440
In the shows!

2278
02:17:43,140 --> 02:17:47,080
He was one of the later additions to, like, um...

2279
02:17:47,080 --> 02:17:48,000
To Winnie the Pooh!

2280
02:17:49,400 --> 02:17:51,440
Oh my God, it makes so much more sense.

2281
02:17:51,540 --> 02:17:52,900
It makes so much sense!

2282
02:17:53,460 --> 02:17:54,640
He was added later!

2283
02:17:55,160 --> 02:17:56,820
Because he came back from the war!

2284
02:17:57,360 --> 02:17:59,060
He came back from the war!

2285
02:17:59,480 --> 02:18:01,440
So they added him later.

2286
02:18:03,660 --> 02:18:04,540
It's canon.

2287
02:18:04,660 --> 02:18:05,780
It's always been canon.

2288
02:18:07,860 --> 02:18:08,980
Hey, Rude, do you know...

2289
02:18:08,980 --> 02:18:10,420
Did I get all your cookies?

2290
02:18:12,820 --> 02:18:14,820
And he plays with Rude, too!

2291
02:18:16,720 --> 02:18:18,620
He's like his new dad!

2292
02:18:18,960 --> 02:18:20,040
Because he, like...

2293
02:18:20,040 --> 02:18:21,220
He felt bad!

2294
02:18:22,100 --> 02:18:23,600
Because he took the shot!

2295
02:18:26,120 --> 02:18:27,240
That's why!

2296
02:18:27,820 --> 02:18:29,680
He felt so bad!

2297
02:18:31,300 --> 02:18:33,260
So, like, he's like his new father figure!

2298
02:18:34,240 --> 02:18:35,860
Because it was, like...

2299
02:18:35,860 --> 02:18:42,580
He's like, I promise Mr. Kinga that I will look after you when he's gone!

2300
02:18:46,390 --> 02:18:48,970
You're not my real kangaroo, dad!

2301
02:18:49,030 --> 02:18:50,210
You're not even a kangaroo!

2302
02:18:50,810 --> 02:18:52,490
But you can teach Rude to jump!

2303
02:18:52,570 --> 02:18:53,530
Because he's a Tigger!

2304
02:18:54,290 --> 02:18:55,670
So, like, you know how, like...

2305
02:18:55,670 --> 02:18:57,410
So, like, you know how, like...

2306
02:18:57,410 --> 02:19:00,630
You know, like, dads who teach, like, their kids to ride a bike?

2307
02:19:00,990 --> 02:19:03,770
So, like, Tigger teaches Rude how to jump!

2308
02:19:04,350 --> 02:19:06,110
Because they both can jump!

2309
02:19:06,910 --> 02:19:08,010
So cute!

2310
02:19:08,010 --> 02:19:09,990
You made me happy!

2311
02:19:11,990 --> 02:19:13,570
Thank you for the super chat!

2312
02:19:13,710 --> 02:19:14,970
Thank you!

2313
02:19:24,570 --> 02:19:25,250
Alright.

2314
02:19:27,310 --> 02:19:28,670
Yeah, but...

2315
02:19:28,670 --> 02:19:31,030
Mrs. Kanga doesn't like Tigger, though.

2316
02:19:31,770 --> 02:19:32,990
She doesn't like him.

2317
02:19:33,710 --> 02:19:35,010
Now we know why.

2318
02:19:36,250 --> 02:19:37,010
She was like...

2319
02:19:37,010 --> 02:19:38,250
You're the reason why!

2320
02:19:38,970 --> 02:19:40,510
Who doesn't have a father?

2321
02:19:40,510 --> 02:19:42,370
It was all your fault!

2322
02:19:43,950 --> 02:19:44,750
And then...

2323
02:19:44,750 --> 02:19:45,630
Tigger was like...

2324
02:19:45,630 --> 02:19:48,090
I'm trying, Mrs. Kanga!

2325
02:19:49,490 --> 02:19:51,490
I can't do Tigger's voice.

2326
02:19:53,490 --> 02:19:55,430
Mrs. Kanga, I'm trying my best!

2327
02:20:03,370 --> 02:20:04,610
Alright, I did it!

2328
02:20:05,110 --> 02:20:06,310
Are there any more cookies?

2329
02:20:07,270 --> 02:20:08,310
What do you mean?

2330
02:20:08,310 --> 02:20:09,690
I'm gonna use the bathroom.

2331
02:20:09,990 --> 02:20:11,770
I'll be right back.

2332
02:20:14,100 --> 02:20:15,670
Use the bathroom?

2333
02:21:11,350 --> 02:21:12,890
I don't...

2334
02:21:12,890 --> 02:21:13,990
I don't understand!

2335
02:21:14,810 --> 02:21:17,770
What needs to be kicked?

2336
02:21:20,030 --> 02:21:22,650
What needs to be kicked?

2337
02:21:23,370 --> 02:21:24,750
What is it?

2338
02:21:25,670 --> 02:21:28,790
What could it be, Mrs. Kanga?

2339
02:21:31,710 --> 02:21:31,790
What?

2340
02:21:32,990 --> 02:21:35,170
Did I not kick this?

2341
02:21:35,490 --> 02:21:37,070
It was the couch!

2342
02:21:37,810 --> 02:21:39,330
Did I not kick the couch?

2343
02:21:39,790 --> 02:21:42,030
I swear I kicked...

2344
02:21:42,030 --> 02:21:43,770
I swear I kicked the couch!

2345
02:21:44,110 --> 02:21:45,070
I kicked everything!

2346
02:21:49,270 --> 02:21:53,430
It was this!

2347
02:21:53,910 --> 02:21:54,970
It was this!

2348
02:21:57,550 --> 02:21:59,490
I didn't kick that!

2349
02:21:59,490 --> 02:22:00,090
Alright.

2350
02:22:00,950 --> 02:22:03,510
Thank you for your very first super chat.

2351
02:22:03,690 --> 02:22:04,750
Thank you, thank you.

2352
02:22:04,930 --> 02:22:05,750
I got it!

2353
02:22:06,050 --> 02:22:06,810
There's no way!

2354
02:22:06,970 --> 02:22:08,210
I definitely kicked it!

2355
02:22:11,110 --> 02:22:14,050
Oh, you found the key.

2356
02:22:14,170 --> 02:22:15,710
Oh, you found it.

2357
02:22:17,190 --> 02:22:20,290
She just needed me to be like her fucking maid.

2358
02:22:21,430 --> 02:22:22,110
Oh my god, look.

2359
02:22:22,210 --> 02:22:23,730
Oh guys, how convenient.

2360
02:22:24,130 --> 02:22:25,930
She found the key.

2361
02:22:25,930 --> 02:22:27,910
So convenient.

2362
02:22:30,170 --> 02:22:36,390
She had it in her fucking Kanga pouch this entire time.

2363
02:22:37,030 --> 02:22:37,570
Wow.

2364
02:22:37,930 --> 02:22:39,810
She found it.

2365
02:22:42,670 --> 02:22:46,810
She decided to work just hard enough to be rewarded.

2366
02:22:48,810 --> 02:22:50,130
The piglet purgatory.

2367
02:22:50,910 --> 02:22:52,490
Red crow, thank you for the gifted chips.

2368
02:22:52,670 --> 02:22:53,530
Thank you, thank you.

2369
02:22:54,770 --> 02:22:55,930
Thank you for the super chat.

2370
02:22:56,050 --> 02:22:56,750
Thank you, thank you.

2371
02:22:56,810 --> 02:23:01,450
I can't believe it.

2372
02:23:02,210 --> 02:23:03,290
Oh my god.

2373
02:23:05,790 --> 02:23:08,310
God, I have so much kick energy now.

2374
02:23:08,730 --> 02:23:10,750
I need to kick something.

2375
02:23:13,950 --> 02:23:14,910
Wow, Doki.

2376
02:23:15,310 --> 02:23:16,770
She's trying to teach you responsibility.

2377
02:23:17,350 --> 02:23:18,710
How thoughtful of her.

2378
02:23:19,170 --> 02:23:20,050
Oh my god.

2379
02:23:23,930 --> 02:23:25,690
Sharky, thank you for the 5 gift chips.

2380
02:23:25,810 --> 02:23:26,930
Thank you, thank you.

2381
02:23:29,430 --> 02:23:30,230
I'm just...

2382
02:23:30,230 --> 02:23:31,170
God damn it.

2383
02:23:32,290 --> 02:23:33,410
She's gonna crack one day.

2384
02:23:35,070 --> 02:23:36,630
Piglet's gonna crack one day.

2385
02:23:37,230 --> 02:23:39,690
He just hasn't hit puberty yet, you don't know that guys.

2386
02:23:40,770 --> 02:23:41,370
I like to...

2387
02:23:42,070 --> 02:23:42,470
Stop.

2388
02:23:43,090 --> 02:23:43,910
Thank you for the super chat.

2389
02:23:44,030 --> 02:23:44,670
Thank you, thank you.

2390
02:23:45,190 --> 02:23:55,050
I think like the freakiest thing about kangaroos is that they just poop out an embryo and then forces...

2391
02:23:55,410 --> 02:23:59,650
For those who don't know, kangaroo births they don't even...

2392
02:24:00,670 --> 02:24:08,130
They basically extract the baby when they're just a tiny little embryo with just tiny little legs.

2393
02:24:09,330 --> 02:24:11,210
It's like the size of a penny.

2394
02:24:11,670 --> 02:24:13,470
They crawl to your pouch.

2395
02:24:13,470 --> 02:24:18,590
They just start crawling to the pouch and just live there until they're fully grown.

2396
02:24:21,070 --> 02:24:21,550
Tokyo!

2397
02:24:22,430 --> 02:24:25,530
Yeah, and they live in that pouch.

2398
02:24:25,630 --> 02:24:26,690
They literally like...

2399
02:24:26,690 --> 02:24:27,210
Yes, I do.

2400
02:24:27,430 --> 02:24:28,090
Oh, there it is.

2401
02:24:30,850 --> 02:24:35,650
They like live there, they poop in there, they like pee in there, they eat in there.

2402
02:24:35,830 --> 02:24:41,150
They suckle on the teeth in that pouch until they're fully grown and then leave the pouch.

2403
02:24:42,330 --> 02:24:43,530
I was eating.

2404
02:24:52,010 --> 02:24:55,410
And they don't leave until they're fully grown.

2405
02:25:00,450 --> 02:25:02,330
You don't need real toys!

2406
02:25:03,030 --> 02:25:04,270
Did you see that?

2407
02:25:05,870 --> 02:25:08,370
His fucking toy is also made of paper.

2408
02:25:09,190 --> 02:25:10,310
That's so sad.

2409
02:25:23,770 --> 02:25:24,570
Thank you!

2410
02:25:27,350 --> 02:25:29,590
Yeah, so you don't want to get in that pouch, by the way.

2411
02:25:29,730 --> 02:25:33,290
The whole story about that is that you do not want to get in that pouch.

2412
02:25:35,770 --> 02:25:38,190
Oh my god, look at all these cookies!

2413
02:25:39,110 --> 02:25:40,510
God, I hate Mrs. Kenga.

2414
02:25:41,450 --> 02:25:42,630
I hate Mrs. Kenga.

2415
02:25:43,810 --> 02:25:44,890
It was not worth it.

2416
02:25:46,030 --> 02:25:47,250
Like how Christopher is like...

2417
02:25:48,390 --> 02:25:50,710
Christopher's advice is not... Oh wait, I can erase!

2418
02:25:50,810 --> 02:25:51,930
I can erase the rock!

2419
02:25:52,310 --> 02:25:53,770
I have power now.

2420
02:26:01,290 --> 02:26:02,490
Oh my god.

2421
02:26:03,790 --> 02:26:07,530
Oh my god, I can erase your entire world, Rue.

2422
02:26:08,750 --> 02:26:10,270
Don't make me angry.

2423
02:26:12,140 --> 02:26:14,330
I'm not grabbing all the cookies, guys.

2424
02:26:15,050 --> 02:26:16,270
It's not worth it.

2425
02:26:17,510 --> 02:26:18,190
Oh my god, look!

2426
02:26:21,350 --> 02:26:22,490
Oh my god, look!

2427
02:26:22,630 --> 02:26:22,650
Oh my god, look!

2428
02:26:22,650 --> 02:26:28,490
There's a picture of Rue holding his adopted father's hand.

2429
02:26:28,650 --> 02:26:29,350
Look at that.

2430
02:26:30,010 --> 02:26:30,790
My theory.

2431
02:26:31,410 --> 02:26:32,610
Oh my god, my theory.

2432
02:26:33,010 --> 02:26:34,710
It's not canon anymore.

2433
02:26:36,090 --> 02:26:37,750
It's becoming canon.

2434
02:26:39,310 --> 02:26:40,670
Oh my god.

2435
02:26:41,490 --> 02:26:42,390
I knew it.

2436
02:26:42,430 --> 02:26:43,730
I knew they're not delusions.

2437
02:26:53,590 --> 02:26:54,370
It's real.

2438
02:26:55,570 --> 02:26:57,310
Alright, we gotta go...

2439
02:26:57,310 --> 02:27:02,470
We gotta erase the rock and then find Eeyore because he's like behind.

2440
02:27:02,490 --> 02:27:03,330
I'm pretty sure he's like behind.

2441
02:27:03,450 --> 02:27:04,330
How do I leave this?

2442
02:27:04,410 --> 02:27:05,190
Oh, it's over here.

2443
02:27:06,230 --> 02:27:06,490
Alright.

2444
02:27:07,910 --> 02:27:08,170
See?

2445
02:27:08,370 --> 02:27:13,170
He has no other drawings other than his mom, himself, and Tigger.

2446
02:27:13,850 --> 02:27:17,850
So like my headcanon is becoming canon now.

2447
02:27:18,870 --> 02:27:20,590
Also, thank you for the super chat.

2448
02:27:20,650 --> 02:27:21,630
Thank you, thank you.

2449
02:27:22,650 --> 02:27:23,850
Alright, off we go.

2450
02:27:25,570 --> 02:27:27,170
I wonder if I'm faster if I do this.

2451
02:27:27,230 --> 02:27:31,330
Apparently, the speedrun tech is to get scared until you're super fast.

2452
02:27:31,390 --> 02:27:31,610
You know what?

2453
02:27:31,610 --> 02:27:32,230
I'm gonna do it.

2454
02:27:32,950 --> 02:27:34,170
There's no way I'll die.

2455
02:27:34,550 --> 02:27:35,210
I'm gonna do it.

2456
02:27:35,570 --> 02:27:36,130
Scare me.

2457
02:27:37,950 --> 02:27:39,370
I'm gonna do the speedrun tech.

2458
02:27:40,170 --> 02:27:41,530
I'm gonna go so fast.

2459
02:27:42,950 --> 02:27:44,010
Am I fast enough?

2460
02:27:44,270 --> 02:27:45,550
Come on, scare me again!

2461
02:27:47,190 --> 02:27:48,510
Scare me again!

2462
02:27:52,080 --> 02:27:54,320
I'm gonna get too scared and then I'm gonna die.

2463
02:27:55,660 --> 02:27:57,860
Oh my god, look how fast I am!

2464
02:27:58,180 --> 02:28:00,080
Oh my god, I'm so fast!

2465
02:28:00,560 --> 02:28:02,340
Also, the loading screen gets more depressing.

2466
02:28:06,600 --> 02:28:08,420
Oh my god.

2467
02:28:08,760 --> 02:28:10,560
Look how fast I am!

2468
02:28:12,200 --> 02:28:13,780
I'm speed!

2469
02:28:13,780 --> 02:28:14,440
I'm speed!

2470
02:28:15,900 --> 02:28:17,060
Alright, there we go.

2471
02:28:17,140 --> 02:28:24,580
I don't like that the more scared I get, you can see like the black like I'm gonna fucking die or some shit.

2472
02:28:26,560 --> 02:28:28,680
Just running into the void.

2473
02:28:30,400 --> 02:28:31,680
Alright, let's see.

2474
02:28:31,880 --> 02:28:32,480
I got the eraser.

2475
02:28:35,920 --> 02:28:37,480
I can erase this world.

2476
02:28:37,740 --> 02:28:39,440
It's gonna make me angry bro.

2477
02:28:41,060 --> 02:28:42,980
I can erase everything you love.

2478
02:28:45,420 --> 02:28:49,340
Yeah, I don't like the shadows around the things we do for speed.

2479
02:28:49,420 --> 02:28:54,580
If I see Christopher Robin, I'll like tell him to make- to tell me not to be sad.

2480
02:28:56,480 --> 02:28:57,820
Guys, don't worry.

2481
02:28:58,880 --> 02:29:03,460
If I see Christopher Robin, I'll be like tell me that thing again.

2482
02:29:04,160 --> 02:29:05,600
Tell me not to be sad.

2483
02:29:12,080 --> 02:29:13,040
It's unfortunate.

2484
02:29:13,260 --> 02:29:16,080
His mom is one of the three things that has not made a paper.

2485
02:29:18,140 --> 02:29:19,460
Alright, we got this.

2486
02:29:20,100 --> 02:29:21,200
We gotta pull this.

2487
02:29:21,340 --> 02:29:22,120
Wait, what's this?

2488
02:29:23,040 --> 02:29:23,940
What's this do?

2489
02:29:25,740 --> 02:29:27,260
Oh, a hole.

2490
02:29:28,640 --> 02:29:29,100
What?

2491
02:29:30,560 --> 02:29:31,680
What is that?

2492
02:29:35,060 --> 02:29:38,700
You're right, I couldn't- no, the ladder is like also real for some reason.

2493
02:29:38,840 --> 02:29:39,120
What?

2494
02:29:39,680 --> 02:29:41,000
What am I building?

2495
02:29:43,680 --> 02:29:46,580
Okay, I need to kill- Okay, we'll get this one too.

2496
02:29:50,400 --> 02:29:52,400
I think I remember now!

2497
02:29:53,460 --> 02:29:53,980
Rabbit!

2498
02:29:54,140 --> 02:29:57,200
Rabbit was the- Oh wait, is this the boss fight?

2499
02:29:57,780 --> 02:29:59,180
Oh my god!

2500
02:29:59,440 --> 02:29:59,840
Wait.

2501
02:30:02,460 --> 02:30:03,360
Being an elephant.

2502
02:30:03,780 --> 02:30:06,440
Okay, do you think it was a- Well, it has to be.

2503
02:30:07,200 --> 02:30:07,680
Okay.

2504
02:30:07,920 --> 02:30:09,760
It has to be a male bee.

2505
02:30:13,450 --> 02:30:15,290
Okay, we gotta figure this out.

2506
02:30:15,930 --> 02:30:17,530
Oh my god, who do I fight?

2507
02:30:20,190 --> 02:30:22,750
Okay, but how did this come to be though?

2508
02:30:25,870 --> 02:30:26,830
Oh, easy.

2509
02:30:29,630 --> 02:30:31,550
Okay, we gotta get rid of this guy too.

2510
02:30:32,010 --> 02:30:34,350
I have the stronger move so he'll die faster.

2511
02:30:35,910 --> 02:30:39,510
I think like the further away, the stronger you can do the attacks.

2512
02:30:39,630 --> 02:30:40,190
I'm pretty sure.

2513
02:30:42,330 --> 02:30:43,330
The birds and the bees!

2514
02:30:43,510 --> 02:30:47,430
But instead of the birds and the bees, it's uh...

2515
02:30:47,430 --> 02:30:48,530
Elephants and the bees.

2516
02:30:54,030 --> 02:30:56,350
Honestly, I think it's more so of like

2517
02:30:59,710 --> 02:31:00,150
um...

2518
02:31:00,150 --> 02:31:01,890
The bee thought it was nectar.

2519
02:31:03,570 --> 02:31:09,110
And then maybe like the queen bee thought it was nectar and she was like... and then she just like landed on it.

2520
02:31:09,670 --> 02:31:11,250
And then it out came the elephant bee.

2521
02:31:12,910 --> 02:31:16,170
Because it grew from a larvae and then...

2522
02:31:22,950 --> 02:31:30,570
You had one?

2523
02:31:40,230 --> 02:31:40,890
Oh.

2524
02:31:43,930 --> 02:31:44,570
Oh, that's easy.

2525
02:31:46,630 --> 02:31:48,350
Yeah, you don't need a house.

2526
02:31:52,950 --> 02:31:54,130
Hey, Eeyore!

2527
02:31:54,930 --> 02:31:57,250
You can be homeless for a little longer, right?

2528
02:31:58,770 --> 02:32:00,090
Jesus Christ.

2529
02:32:02,470 --> 02:32:03,770
Eeyore, it's alright.

2530
02:32:03,950 --> 02:32:05,750
You can be homeless a little longer.

2531
02:32:08,730 --> 02:32:10,910
Look, this is Rue's dream.

2532
02:32:11,170 --> 02:32:13,810
He's clearly more important than you.

2533
02:32:15,750 --> 02:32:16,090
What?

2534
02:32:16,630 --> 02:32:17,630
Weirdoki, no!

2535
02:32:17,790 --> 02:32:19,790
That's literally what Piglin implied!

2536
02:32:20,710 --> 02:32:22,530
Piglin implied that!

2537
02:32:22,790 --> 02:32:25,490
He's like, can I use it instead?

2538
02:32:28,970 --> 02:32:30,070
That's so dumb.

2539
02:32:30,070 --> 02:32:31,710
That's more fucked up!

2540
02:32:39,690 --> 02:32:42,770
Oh, wait!

2541
02:32:42,910 --> 02:32:43,790
Oh, I can do it!

2542
02:32:45,770 --> 02:32:46,730
I got glue in!

2543
02:32:46,930 --> 02:32:49,270
If only he has this paper glue.

2544
02:32:51,110 --> 02:32:53,210
With this paper brush.

2545
02:32:54,610 --> 02:32:57,290
This gamerjokey's fun facts.

2546
02:32:57,290 --> 02:32:59,270
Night, thank you for the super chat!

2547
02:32:59,450 --> 02:33:00,530
Thank you, thank you!

2548
02:33:01,530 --> 02:33:03,130
Dark, thank you for the super chat!

2549
02:33:03,250 --> 02:33:04,030
Thank you, thank you!

2550
02:33:04,150 --> 02:33:06,250
The size difference goes crazy.

2551
02:33:11,250 --> 02:33:12,450
I will give...

2552
02:33:12,450 --> 02:33:14,210
Oh, God!

2553
02:33:14,710 --> 02:33:16,630
Thank you for the super chat!

2554
02:33:16,710 --> 02:33:17,730
Thank you, thank you!

2555
02:33:18,070 --> 02:33:19,910
Oh my God, God!

2556
02:33:22,710 --> 02:33:23,630
He's homeless!

2557
02:33:23,630 --> 02:33:25,630
He lives in a sick house!

2558
02:33:29,090 --> 02:33:29,850
Look,

2559
02:33:34,870 --> 02:33:37,190
Eeyore, all I'm saying...

2560
02:33:37,190 --> 02:33:39,630
Eeyore, all I'm saying is that...

2561
02:33:41,510 --> 02:33:44,830
Rue's ball is more important than you.

2562
02:33:47,610 --> 02:33:53,610
But like, I'm not saying that, the game is saying...

2563
02:33:53,610 --> 02:33:53,830
I'm not saying that.

2564
02:34:06,150 --> 02:34:07,730
Alright, what's my attack now?

2565
02:34:09,490 --> 02:34:10,530
Jesus Christ.

2566
02:34:14,750 --> 02:34:15,990
Stretch your face.

2567
02:34:17,630 --> 02:34:19,170
Lurkrosis, thank you for the super chat!

2568
02:34:19,310 --> 02:34:20,130
Thank you, thank you!

2569
02:34:20,230 --> 02:34:23,370
I could listen to Peter Cullen's voice Eeyore all day.

2570
02:34:23,570 --> 02:34:26,950
Oh guys, I finally watched Transformers 1.

2571
02:34:28,630 --> 02:34:30,190
It was on the plane.

2572
02:34:30,190 --> 02:34:32,470
I finally watched Transformers 1.

2573
02:34:33,430 --> 02:34:34,030
And...

2574
02:34:34,030 --> 02:34:35,030
Oh wait, what?

2575
02:34:35,310 --> 02:34:35,950
Wait, he's back?

2576
02:34:38,670 --> 02:34:40,330
Wait, the bees are back?

2577
02:34:40,930 --> 02:34:42,170
No, not the bees!

2578
02:34:42,330 --> 02:34:43,230
Not the bees!

2579
02:34:43,910 --> 02:34:44,950
Not the bees!

2580
02:34:45,970 --> 02:34:47,190
It's okay, we're fine.

2581
02:34:48,270 --> 02:34:48,950
How far is he?

2582
02:34:51,950 --> 02:34:53,450
It's fine, I got the strong attack.

2583
02:34:58,490 --> 02:34:59,910
That's right, leave!

2584
02:34:59,910 --> 02:35:01,430
Leave, bees!

2585
02:35:03,410 --> 02:35:05,910
I'm gonna grab this, and then...

2586
02:35:06,470 --> 02:35:07,930
So I can leave this area.

2587
02:35:09,770 --> 02:35:10,670
Alright, nice.

2588
02:35:12,690 --> 02:35:20,450
I thought it was really funny that Chris Hemsworth voiced Orion Pax.

2589
02:35:21,110 --> 02:35:22,250
Or Optimus Prime.

2590
02:35:23,270 --> 02:35:24,270
It's so weird.

2591
02:35:24,390 --> 02:35:25,790
Because I was like, who the fuck is that guy?

2592
02:35:25,930 --> 02:35:27,910
I was like, who's voice is that?

2593
02:35:27,910 --> 02:35:29,050
His voice is so familiar.

2594
02:35:29,150 --> 02:35:30,250
Alright, Christopher.

2595
02:35:32,290 --> 02:35:33,550
Stop being sad, Piglet.

2596
02:35:37,210 --> 02:35:38,910
Piglet, stop being sad.

2597
02:35:39,150 --> 02:35:40,250
And then you'll be happy.

2598
02:35:44,050 --> 02:35:45,670
What do you mean spoilers?!

2599
02:35:45,670 --> 02:35:48,850
I'm just telling you who the voice actor is!

2600
02:35:49,330 --> 02:35:50,630
Wait, what do I have?

2601
02:35:50,810 --> 02:35:51,550
Okay, I'll just stay.

2602
02:35:58,630 --> 02:36:00,290
Look, see, I'm happy now.

2603
02:36:00,350 --> 02:36:00,910
It works.

2604
02:36:02,690 --> 02:36:03,770
It works, guys.

2605
02:36:07,750 --> 02:36:09,630
Dark Ace, thank you for the super chat.

2606
02:36:09,730 --> 02:36:10,550
Thank you, thank you.

2607
02:36:10,650 --> 02:36:11,350
Let's be real.

2608
02:36:12,290 --> 02:36:16,050
Eyora was the gateway to Sad Girl for a lot of people.

2609
02:36:16,850 --> 02:36:18,070
Eyora and like...

2610
02:36:18,070 --> 02:36:22,350
Eyora and like Squidward were like for like...

2611
02:36:22,350 --> 02:36:23,650
edgy, sad kids.

2612
02:36:26,450 --> 02:36:27,830
Their quotes and stuff.

2613
02:36:28,810 --> 02:36:30,750
I remember I used to...

2614
02:36:30,750 --> 02:36:35,130
when I was young, I grew up in Catholic or Christian private school.

2615
02:36:35,250 --> 02:36:36,050
I don't know which one.

2616
02:36:36,170 --> 02:36:37,290
I always get confused.

2617
02:36:37,830 --> 02:36:39,090
And then like...

2618
02:36:39,090 --> 02:36:40,910
it was like uniforms and stuff.

2619
02:36:41,710 --> 02:36:42,730
No, it's true.

2620
02:36:42,970 --> 02:36:44,610
It was like, okay, we have uniforms.

2621
02:36:45,130 --> 02:36:51,310
But one day, we had a special day where if you give two dollars, you can wear whatever you want.

2622
02:36:51,410 --> 02:36:51,740
So like...

2623
02:36:52,360 --> 02:36:57,440
By the way, my parents bought me this shirt because my dad thought it was funny.

2624
02:36:58,040 --> 02:36:58,720
And like...

2625
02:36:58,720 --> 02:37:01,160
My dad...

2626
02:37:01,160 --> 02:37:02,700
Oh my god, there's so many Hufflepuffs.

2627
02:37:03,540 --> 02:37:05,120
I'm gonna run past all of them.

2628
02:37:05,840 --> 02:37:07,180
I'm gonna run past all of them.

2629
02:37:07,240 --> 02:37:08,940
Oh god, okay, never mind.

2630
02:37:09,060 --> 02:37:09,960
That's way too close.

2631
02:37:11,260 --> 02:37:13,060
That's way too close.

2632
02:37:13,500 --> 02:37:13,980
Get out.

2633
02:37:15,300 --> 02:37:16,160
Get out.

2634
02:37:18,480 --> 02:37:19,440
Okay, so...

2635
02:37:19,440 --> 02:37:21,200
So like...

2636
02:37:21,200 --> 02:37:25,480
But it was like a special day where you pay two dollars and everything.

2637
02:37:26,100 --> 02:37:27,320
So it's not like...

2638
02:37:27,320 --> 02:37:28,640
It was like a special occasion.

2639
02:37:28,820 --> 02:37:30,320
So my dad bought me this shirt.

2640
02:37:31,400 --> 02:37:33,440
And the shirt read...

2641
02:37:35,800 --> 02:37:38,900
I can't believe I'm surrounded by stupid people.

2642
02:37:44,800 --> 02:37:45,360
And...

2643
02:37:45,360 --> 02:37:48,500
My mom let me go to school with that shirt on.

2644
02:37:54,020 --> 02:37:55,920
And I came to school...

2645
02:37:55,920 --> 02:37:57,060
I thought it was...

2646
02:37:57,060 --> 02:37:59,680
My parents and I thought it was hilarious.

2647
02:38:04,040 --> 02:38:06,300
Yeah, I got it.

2648
02:38:06,340 --> 02:38:07,040
It's right here.

2649
02:38:08,660 --> 02:38:09,520
Wait, it's this one.

2650
02:38:15,670 --> 02:38:17,810
And then, I went to school with that shirt on.

2651
02:38:17,810 --> 02:38:19,970
Teacher saw me in that shirt.

2652
02:38:20,250 --> 02:38:22,210
She pulled me aside from class.

2653
02:38:22,230 --> 02:38:23,610
I was like, you gotta change.

2654
02:38:30,270 --> 02:38:31,670
I did it!

2655
02:38:31,850 --> 02:38:33,510
Who the fuck are you?

2656
02:38:34,710 --> 02:38:36,210
Why is he green?

2657
02:38:37,210 --> 02:38:37,790
Wow.

2658
02:38:38,130 --> 02:38:39,130
Wow, Doki.

2659
02:38:40,230 --> 02:38:41,330
Where are you?

2660
02:38:41,450 --> 02:38:44,290
Fucking Glinda from Wizard of Oz.

2661
02:38:45,230 --> 02:38:46,570
By the way, I watched Wicked yesterday.

2662
02:38:46,570 --> 02:38:49,530
He's like, why is he fucking green?

2663
02:38:54,550 --> 02:38:56,170
He's the ball thief.

2664
02:38:57,450 --> 02:38:59,250
Give us back the ball!

2665
02:38:59,810 --> 02:39:03,110
We fucking sweeten the ears homeless because of this ball.

2666
02:39:08,390 --> 02:39:09,110
Freak!

2667
02:39:09,230 --> 02:39:10,170
He's a freak!

2668
02:39:20,620 --> 02:39:21,900
You want the ball.

2669
02:39:22,280 --> 02:39:22,960
How touching.

2670
02:39:23,680 --> 02:39:25,620
But you seem to be a little scared.

2671
02:39:26,520 --> 02:39:27,900
Oh, I've an idea.

2672
02:39:28,300 --> 02:39:30,980
If you scare me, I'll let you in.

2673
02:39:31,300 --> 02:39:33,460
But I think you are much too frightened.

2674
02:39:34,120 --> 02:39:37,560
Da-na-na-na-na was based off of Piglet's Big Game.

2675
02:39:37,840 --> 02:39:38,780
She saw...

2676
02:39:38,780 --> 02:39:40,240
The author saw...

2677
02:39:40,240 --> 02:39:40,440
What?

2678
02:39:40,680 --> 02:39:42,480
The author saw...

2679
02:39:42,480 --> 02:39:43,260
What the fuck?

2680
02:39:43,520 --> 02:39:46,520
Why is he groaning?

2681
02:39:47,380 --> 02:39:48,440
Like, why are you groaning?

2682
02:39:48,440 --> 02:39:49,800
I'm trying to tell a story.

2683
02:39:50,000 --> 02:39:50,800
Stop groaning.

2684
02:39:50,960 --> 02:39:51,980
It's making me uncomfortable.

2685
02:39:52,560 --> 02:39:56,200
As I say, Da-na-na-na-na was inspired by the guy that took his balls.

2686
02:39:57,100 --> 02:39:59,180
It all makes sense now.

2687
02:40:02,240 --> 02:40:04,480
I got so many scary faces.

2688
02:40:04,700 --> 02:40:06,180
Wait, I bought all the scary faces.

2689
02:40:06,480 --> 02:40:06,580
Oh.

2690
02:40:07,340 --> 02:40:07,820
Okay.

2691
02:40:08,400 --> 02:40:10,200
Alright, I'll show you all my scary faces.

2692
02:40:10,820 --> 02:40:12,380
Watch this, door!

2693
02:40:14,420 --> 02:40:15,540
What the fuck?

2694
02:40:15,580 --> 02:40:16,620
That's a long combo.

2695
02:40:18,440 --> 02:40:19,120
That's right.

2696
02:40:19,700 --> 02:40:22,240
Now fucking... Oh my god.

2697
02:40:22,260 --> 02:40:22,940
I killed him.

2698
02:40:23,260 --> 02:40:24,280
That's right.

2699
02:40:25,100 --> 02:40:26,140
Rue, did you see that?

2700
02:40:26,540 --> 02:40:27,580
That was murder.

2701
02:40:28,780 --> 02:40:30,380
Wow, I just witnessed a murder.

2702
02:40:34,500 --> 02:40:35,820
Okay, so...

2703
02:40:36,440 --> 02:40:37,400
Where am I now?

2704
02:40:38,760 --> 02:40:40,140
I turned him to ash.

2705
02:40:41,460 --> 02:40:42,520
Poor killer.

2706
02:40:44,380 --> 02:40:45,040
What?

2707
02:40:46,240 --> 02:40:46,880
What?

2708
02:40:50,940 --> 02:40:53,560
Rue, what the fuck are you thinking of?

2709
02:40:54,260 --> 02:40:56,660
What's going on in your head, Rue?

2710
02:40:57,200 --> 02:40:58,760
This is his mental health.

2711
02:41:04,420 --> 02:41:05,520
What the...

2712
02:41:06,780 --> 02:41:09,640
What the fuck is Rue thinking of right now?

2713
02:41:13,040 --> 02:41:13,940
That's okay.

2714
02:41:13,940 --> 02:41:14,100
That's okay.

2715
02:41:14,500 --> 02:41:15,720
Get out of my head.

2716
02:41:19,240 --> 02:41:21,180
No, it's not Piglet, it's Rue.

2717
02:41:22,160 --> 02:41:23,520
Oh wait, the dorm murderer.

2718
02:41:23,660 --> 02:41:24,540
Yeah, no, it's Piglet.

2719
02:41:25,160 --> 02:41:26,180
Piglet's the dorm murderer.

2720
02:41:28,300 --> 02:41:31,620
Rue's got a little bit of trauma going on.

2721
02:41:31,780 --> 02:41:32,440
Oh, thank god.

2722
02:41:33,700 --> 02:41:34,900
Turned into a potion.

2723
02:41:34,900 --> 02:41:36,900
A potion.

2724
02:41:46,180 --> 02:41:47,480
You know what he reminds me of?

2725
02:41:47,740 --> 02:41:47,960
Lorp.

2726
02:41:48,940 --> 02:41:51,260
I cannot keep up with internet memes anymore.

2727
02:41:51,840 --> 02:41:54,300
Like, I thought I was like, oh my god, finally.

2728
02:41:55,140 --> 02:41:58,840
I was like, oh my god, I'm catching up with the times.

2729
02:41:59,360 --> 02:42:01,200
And now there's like...

2730
02:42:01,200 --> 02:42:02,020
What's it called?

2731
02:42:02,260 --> 02:42:03,440
The fucking queen?

2732
02:42:04,200 --> 02:42:05,320
Queens don't cry?

2733
02:42:05,860 --> 02:42:07,140
Oh wait, he dodged it!

2734
02:42:08,280 --> 02:42:09,320
That's illegal!

2735
02:42:09,820 --> 02:42:11,240
You just closed your eyes?

2736
02:42:12,300 --> 02:42:14,720
You mean you can just close your eyes?

2737
02:42:19,840 --> 02:42:20,440
Okay.

2738
02:42:26,920 --> 02:42:28,120
Queens never...

2739
02:42:28,120 --> 02:42:37,340
I love like, I love like, my favorite part, my favorite meme of that part was like, um, devils never cry.

2740
02:42:41,900 --> 02:42:44,260
That one was my favorite part.

2741
02:42:44,980 --> 02:42:47,520
Like, meme of it.

2742
02:42:55,980 --> 02:42:58,460
Little me would have failed all of this, by the way.

2743
02:42:59,980 --> 02:43:00,480
Stop!

2744
02:43:00,780 --> 02:43:02,260
Stop closing your eyes!

2745
02:43:02,320 --> 02:43:02,980
That's illegal!

2746
02:43:03,600 --> 02:43:04,980
That's actually illegal.

2747
02:43:05,740 --> 02:43:07,440
This is like my entire job.

2748
02:43:08,460 --> 02:43:09,920
Oh no, no!

2749
02:43:10,420 --> 02:43:11,580
That's all I have!

2750
02:43:12,520 --> 02:43:13,600
The parry!

2751
02:43:14,020 --> 02:43:15,440
How is he parrying?!

2752
02:43:21,120 --> 02:43:21,960
Oh no.

2753
02:43:22,960 --> 02:43:24,340
Oh, he's getting closer.

2754
02:43:25,060 --> 02:43:26,020
He's getting closer!

2755
02:43:26,560 --> 02:43:28,000
The boss has hands!

2756
02:43:29,040 --> 02:43:30,660
There he has hands!

2757
02:43:31,540 --> 02:43:32,420
Alright, we got it.

2758
02:43:38,400 --> 02:43:38,940
Alright.

2759
02:43:38,940 --> 02:43:39,780
I got your ball.

2760
02:43:42,170 --> 02:43:43,740
Thank you for the super chat!

2761
02:43:43,860 --> 02:43:44,780
Thank you!

2762
02:43:47,640 --> 02:43:49,000
I'm your new daddy.

2763
02:43:56,380 --> 02:43:56,900
Daddy.

2764
02:44:00,760 --> 02:44:01,280
What?!

2765
02:44:01,280 --> 02:44:03,720
He literally said like, you're braver than Tigger!

2766
02:44:12,500 --> 02:44:16,000
I'm gonna go up to Tigger and I'll be like, he calls me dad.

2767
02:44:19,000 --> 02:44:20,120
I'm counting his cabbages.

2768
02:44:20,680 --> 02:44:22,840
And Tigger painted everything orange.

2769
02:44:23,540 --> 02:44:24,940
Owl had fallen asleep.

2770
02:44:25,180 --> 02:44:27,000
Oh, it's time to accept Owl!

2771
02:44:29,300 --> 02:44:30,400
Oh, wait!

2772
02:44:32,500 --> 02:44:34,580
Guys, I'm gonna show you Eeyore's dream.

2773
02:44:35,280 --> 02:44:36,660
And you'll know what I mean.

2774
02:44:40,600 --> 02:44:43,060
Guys, I'm gonna show you Eeyore's dreams, guys.

2775
02:44:45,860 --> 02:44:48,080
I never made it to...

2776
02:44:48,080 --> 02:44:50,680
Wait, that means I never made past Owl!

2777
02:44:52,440 --> 02:44:55,540
Wait, I never made it past Owl!

2778
02:44:56,360 --> 02:44:57,660
Because I don't ever...

2779
02:44:57,660 --> 02:44:59,820
I don't remember doing Eeyore's...

2780
02:44:59,820 --> 02:45:00,980
Eeyore's level.

2781
02:45:08,090 --> 02:45:09,910
Okay, but I want to show you Eeyore's level.

2782
02:45:11,410 --> 02:45:13,290
Eeyore's level is actually pretty fucked up.

2783
02:45:14,150 --> 02:45:15,150
Out of all the levels.

2784
02:45:15,530 --> 02:45:18,590
Also, here, Optimus Prime's voice coming out of Eeyore.

2785
02:45:18,590 --> 02:45:20,890
What is Christopher Robin's name?

2786
02:45:21,010 --> 02:45:23,130
Where those faces Piglet was making.

2787
02:45:24,050 --> 02:45:25,990
That actually looks horrifically creepy.

2788
02:45:26,210 --> 02:45:26,970
Thank you for the superchat.

2789
02:45:27,070 --> 02:45:27,750
Thank you, thank you.

2790
02:45:30,190 --> 02:45:32,370
This is what Eeyore sees.

2791
02:45:32,370 --> 02:45:32,930
Piglet!

2792
02:45:33,190 --> 02:45:34,010
Hey, Piglet!

2793
02:45:34,610 --> 02:45:35,770
Oh, hello, Rue.

2794
02:45:36,110 --> 02:45:37,610
Do you know what's happening here?

2795
02:45:37,950 --> 02:45:40,610
I'm not sure, but this place is a little scary.

2796
02:45:40,990 --> 02:45:42,650
Everything's kinda dark.

2797
02:45:43,170 --> 02:45:45,110
Eeyore sure seems to be sad.

2798
02:45:45,530 --> 02:45:46,530
Even for Eeyore.

2799
02:45:46,670 --> 02:45:47,530
You're right!

2800
02:45:47,790 --> 02:45:49,750
Maybe that's why it's so dark.

2801
02:45:50,450 --> 02:45:51,890
Do you think you can cheer him up, Piglet?

2802
02:45:52,390 --> 02:45:53,590
You gotta be careful, though.

2803
02:45:53,890 --> 02:45:55,630
There are woozles all around.

2804
02:45:57,050 --> 02:45:58,230
I rest the streams.

2805
02:45:58,750 --> 02:46:00,110
I see that forest.

2806
02:46:03,130 --> 02:46:03,770
Alright.

2807
02:46:04,110 --> 02:46:04,470
Woah!

2808
02:46:04,750 --> 02:46:05,770
There's trees?

2809
02:46:06,930 --> 02:46:08,850
Yeah, I definitely never played this level.

2810
02:46:14,010 --> 02:46:14,930
It's alright.

2811
02:46:16,390 --> 02:46:18,830
Maybe he'll just stop being sad.

2812
02:46:19,190 --> 02:46:21,250
Just like what Christopher Robin said.

2813
02:46:22,170 --> 02:46:24,250
Stop being sad, Eeyore!

2814
02:46:24,570 --> 02:46:25,470
It works!

2815
02:46:27,110 --> 02:46:28,990
Jesus, this is what he sees.

2816
02:46:30,010 --> 02:46:31,850
This is what Eeyore sees when he wakes up.

2817
02:46:32,230 --> 02:46:33,330
Oh, hey, Amazon Prime.

2818
02:46:36,990 --> 02:46:37,390
Okay...

2819
02:46:37,390 --> 02:46:38,610
What do I move this, then?

2820
02:46:39,470 --> 02:46:39,870
What?

2821
02:46:40,150 --> 02:46:41,150
Do I move it here?

2822
02:46:44,010 --> 02:46:45,110
Oh, it's right here.

2823
02:46:45,290 --> 02:46:46,550
Wait, why do I move it there?

2824
02:46:58,570 --> 02:47:01,050
Oh, so I have to move something there.

2825
02:47:01,150 --> 02:47:02,850
What do I do with the pumpkin here?

2826
02:47:05,270 --> 02:47:05,530
Woah!

2827
02:47:07,470 --> 02:47:08,070
Woah!

2828
02:47:10,910 --> 02:47:11,510
What?

2829
02:47:13,110 --> 02:47:14,550
Can I even kick trees?

2830
02:47:14,670 --> 02:47:15,410
Oh, I can!

2831
02:47:15,590 --> 02:47:15,870
Okay.

2832
02:47:18,030 --> 02:47:20,710
Okay, that gives me...

2833
02:47:21,250 --> 02:47:23,490
Okay, so that gives me cookies.

2834
02:47:23,710 --> 02:47:25,410
So I can kick these trunks for cookies.

2835
02:47:29,210 --> 02:47:31,010
What the fuck?

2836
02:47:33,430 --> 02:47:34,930
I don't have any...

2837
02:47:34,930 --> 02:47:37,170
Wait, back there, there was a lamp!

2838
02:47:37,610 --> 02:47:38,710
I didn't pick up a lamp.

2839
02:47:41,110 --> 02:47:43,370
There was a fire lamp behind me.

2840
02:47:43,690 --> 02:47:44,190
I remember.

2841
02:47:47,070 --> 02:47:47,670
Yeah.

2842
02:47:49,550 --> 02:47:50,090
Okay.

2843
02:47:52,090 --> 02:47:53,330
Oh, give me your lamp.

2844
02:47:59,130 --> 02:48:02,110
This is why you're a child.

2845
02:48:05,610 --> 02:48:08,890
Oh, there's a door here.

2846
02:48:11,010 --> 02:48:12,990
Let's talk to him.

2847
02:48:13,170 --> 02:48:14,930
Impression... Impression...

2848
02:48:14,930 --> 02:48:15,250
Good!

2849
02:48:16,490 --> 02:48:16,790
Woah!

2850
02:48:16,790 --> 02:48:17,330
Woah!

2851
02:48:21,630 --> 02:48:23,070
Where the fuck?

2852
02:48:25,550 --> 02:48:27,630
No, balloon, it's just Christopher Robin.

2853
02:48:27,730 --> 02:48:29,650
Just telling me to stop being sad.

2854
02:48:30,410 --> 02:48:31,670
Like, it's...

2855
02:48:31,670 --> 02:48:32,810
It's sad.

2856
02:48:33,450 --> 02:48:35,290
It's just literally...

2857
02:48:35,290 --> 02:48:36,550
Stop being sad.

2858
02:48:38,010 --> 02:48:39,010
Why are you sad?

2859
02:48:40,410 --> 02:48:41,590
Is it not this?

2860
02:48:43,290 --> 02:48:45,550
Like, where am I supposed to push it?

2861
02:48:50,300 --> 02:48:50,720
What the fuck?

2862
02:48:51,800 --> 02:48:53,440
Is there anywhere here?

2863
02:48:55,380 --> 02:48:56,680
That I'm missing?

2864
02:49:00,340 --> 02:49:02,380
Can I get past these rocks?

2865
02:49:08,030 --> 02:49:09,290
I don't understand.

2866
02:49:10,010 --> 02:49:12,210
Oh, what the...

2867
02:49:12,210 --> 02:49:13,770
Oh, I can't go around?

2868
02:49:13,870 --> 02:49:14,310
Okay.

2869
02:49:16,110 --> 02:49:17,710
Wait, but...

2870
02:49:17,710 --> 02:49:18,350
There's nothing.

2871
02:49:18,830 --> 02:49:20,070
Oh, can I push this over?

2872
02:49:22,590 --> 02:49:23,730
Wait, what?

2873
02:49:26,190 --> 02:49:27,430
I don't understand.

2874
02:49:30,510 --> 02:49:31,390
Am I...

2875
02:49:34,220 --> 02:49:37,560
What the fuck am I supposed to do with this Goddamn pumpkin?

2876
02:49:41,720 --> 02:49:42,960
It won't leave!

2877
02:49:49,480 --> 02:49:52,780
It won't let me push... Can I push the pumpkin into the tent?

2878
02:49:52,920 --> 02:49:53,800
Maybe, let me try.

2879
02:49:55,440 --> 02:49:57,360
No, no, it won't let me put it in the center.

2880
02:49:58,660 --> 02:49:59,960
Okay, let me try this way.

2881
02:49:59,960 --> 02:50:00,020
Okay.

2882
02:50:00,880 --> 02:50:03,180
Yeah, I can either do left or right.

2883
02:50:04,080 --> 02:50:05,940
And I can't do, like, upward.

2884
02:50:06,200 --> 02:50:07,300
Like, upward down.

2885
02:50:12,560 --> 02:50:13,620
I fucking...

2886
02:50:13,620 --> 02:50:14,380
I hate this game.

2887
02:50:18,960 --> 02:50:19,520
I...

2888
02:50:24,460 --> 02:50:26,440
This is Amazon's fault.

2889
02:50:27,280 --> 02:50:28,000
This is...

2890
02:50:29,960 --> 02:50:31,420
This is Amazon's fault.

2891
02:50:33,640 --> 02:50:34,480
What's that?

2892
02:50:42,560 --> 02:50:43,460
What the fuck?

2893
02:50:46,100 --> 02:50:47,720
Omega, thank you for the super chat!

2894
02:50:47,840 --> 02:50:48,880
Thank you, thank you!

2895
02:50:48,960 --> 02:50:50,520
I've never played Honkai before.

2896
02:50:53,520 --> 02:50:54,900
So, I don't know, Omega.

2897
02:50:55,320 --> 02:50:56,200
What's in your bank account?

2898
02:50:58,100 --> 02:50:58,580
The bed!

2899
02:51:06,240 --> 02:51:07,360
Wait, is that the Joker?

2900
02:51:12,340 --> 02:51:13,000
Sellout, Joker.

2901
02:51:13,000 --> 02:51:14,260
You guys know I'm a sellout.

2902
02:51:20,080 --> 02:51:20,480
Again?

2903
02:51:23,320 --> 02:51:24,620
It's the green guy!

2904
02:51:25,280 --> 02:51:28,060
He's like the purple guy, but, like, green.

2905
02:51:32,280 --> 02:51:34,140
Oh my God, it's the green man.

2906
02:51:34,940 --> 02:51:36,440
Is that the green guy from 1987?

2907
02:51:40,420 --> 02:51:42,200
Okay, we gotta...

2908
02:51:42,200 --> 02:51:42,880
No!

2909
02:51:43,140 --> 02:51:44,300
Close his eyes again!

2910
02:51:45,320 --> 02:51:45,840
Fucking...

2911
02:51:45,840 --> 02:51:47,300
He did it at the last second!

2912
02:51:48,860 --> 02:51:49,640
Oh God.

2913
02:51:49,840 --> 02:51:51,040
Oh my God, he's so close.

2914
02:51:52,500 --> 02:51:53,780
He's actually so close.

2915
02:51:53,860 --> 02:51:55,020
Oh, thank God, he disappeared.

2916
02:51:56,300 --> 02:51:57,340
He fucking...

2917
02:51:57,340 --> 02:51:57,840
Shrunk.

2918
02:51:59,540 --> 02:52:00,060
Alright.

2919
02:52:01,020 --> 02:52:01,520
That's fine.

2920
02:52:04,720 --> 02:52:05,240
Okay.

2921
02:52:05,240 --> 02:52:05,660
Okay.

2922
02:52:08,380 --> 02:52:09,540
Thank you!

2923
02:52:09,700 --> 02:52:12,100
She's having more trouble with these puzzles than...

2924
02:52:12,100 --> 02:52:15,460
Okay, like, I can't push it two sides to the right!

2925
02:52:15,720 --> 02:52:18,980
It has to be specifically two sides to the left!

2926
02:52:22,080 --> 02:52:22,660
Oh,

2927
02:52:25,920 --> 02:52:27,280
they're just normal enemies now.

2928
02:52:27,360 --> 02:52:27,640
Yeah.

2929
02:52:29,400 --> 02:52:31,200
What the fuck, Eeyore?

2930
02:52:34,180 --> 02:52:35,720
What have you been...

2931
02:52:35,720 --> 02:52:36,860
Are you having night...

2932
02:52:36,860 --> 02:52:39,580
Bro, this guy's been having night terrors or some shit.

2933
02:52:39,640 --> 02:52:40,040
Like, what?

2934
02:52:41,920 --> 02:52:42,480
What?

2935
02:52:45,240 --> 02:52:46,620
Where does this lead me?

2936
02:52:49,400 --> 02:52:51,040
You mean he's not homeless?

2937
02:52:58,930 --> 02:53:01,570
You mean he has a house all along?

2938
02:53:03,410 --> 02:53:04,410
I knew it.

2939
02:53:05,190 --> 02:53:06,970
I knew he was really depressed.

2940
02:53:06,970 --> 02:53:08,370
I knew it.

2941
02:53:10,010 --> 02:53:11,690
Yoki, that's so fun.

2942
02:53:16,080 --> 02:53:16,680
Let's see.

2943
02:53:16,940 --> 02:53:19,660
Okay, at least these guys...

2944
02:53:19,660 --> 02:53:22,280
This is his offshore bank account.

2945
02:53:28,690 --> 02:53:28,970
Okay.

2946
02:53:30,110 --> 02:53:31,010
That's right.

2947
02:53:31,550 --> 02:53:33,010
You can't close your eyes.

2948
02:53:33,670 --> 02:53:34,650
You don't have eyelids!

2949
02:53:34,990 --> 02:53:36,330
I know you don't have eyelids!

2950
02:53:36,330 --> 02:53:37,170
I know you don't have eyelids!

2951
02:53:39,530 --> 02:53:39,970
Oh.

2952
02:53:40,630 --> 02:53:41,610
Oh my gosh.

2953
02:53:41,730 --> 02:53:43,090
Look at that perspective.

2954
02:53:44,590 --> 02:53:45,810
This is actually crazy.

2955
02:53:46,010 --> 02:53:47,150
This is my first time in this level.

2956
02:53:47,190 --> 02:53:48,890
I've only seen, like, one video of this.

2957
02:53:49,010 --> 02:53:49,650
Oh shit.

2958
02:53:50,490 --> 02:53:51,690
Oh shit, I'm sorry.

2959
02:53:51,850 --> 02:53:52,790
I'm freaking out.

2960
02:53:59,830 --> 02:54:00,270
Okay,

2961
02:54:04,250 --> 02:54:05,350
I need another face, though.

2962
02:54:05,350 --> 02:54:07,810
My faces are way too weak now.

2963
02:54:08,370 --> 02:54:09,730
They're too strong.

2964
02:54:10,190 --> 02:54:13,210
They have, like, x500 HP now.

2965
02:54:14,270 --> 02:54:15,690
Oh my god.

2966
02:54:20,500 --> 02:54:21,780
Yo, I was so scared.

2967
02:54:22,100 --> 02:54:24,120
Yo, legitimately, I couldn't finish this game.

2968
02:54:24,200 --> 02:54:25,320
I didn't even get to Eeyore's level.

2969
02:54:25,660 --> 02:54:26,760
Because I was so scared.

2970
02:54:30,880 --> 02:54:31,620
Like, look at...

2971
02:54:31,620 --> 02:54:32,220
Look at this!

2972
02:54:34,140 --> 02:54:35,580
Like, what the fuck?

2973
02:54:40,690 --> 02:54:41,950
This is so wild.

2974
02:54:41,950 --> 02:54:44,270
This is actually so wild.

2975
02:54:49,050 --> 02:54:50,830
It's so trippy.

2976
02:55:08,210 --> 02:55:10,050
I mean...

2977
02:55:10,050 --> 02:55:11,010
Yeah.

2978
02:55:11,870 --> 02:55:13,170
What happened with your interior designer?

2979
02:55:15,330 --> 02:55:18,390
I'll find all the colors of your dream for you.

2980
02:55:18,390 --> 02:55:20,210
That's very kind of you.

2981
02:55:20,210 --> 02:55:21,990
I don't think colors would fix this.

2982
02:55:22,210 --> 02:55:22,850
Piglet.

2983
02:55:23,990 --> 02:55:24,670
Yes, Eeyore?

2984
02:55:25,250 --> 02:55:27,270
Thanks for noticing me.

2985
02:55:27,950 --> 02:55:28,210
Oh!

2986
02:55:30,910 --> 02:55:32,190
Oh, Eeyore!

2987
02:55:32,870 --> 02:55:33,530
Did it work?

2988
02:55:33,850 --> 02:55:35,790
Did talking cure your depression?

2989
02:55:37,170 --> 02:55:40,550
Have you found the three colors of my dream, Piglet?

2990
02:55:40,750 --> 02:55:41,770
Three colors?

2991
02:55:42,150 --> 02:55:43,790
If it's too tough, you needn't bother.

2992
02:55:43,790 --> 02:55:44,570
Oh!

2993
02:55:45,790 --> 02:55:46,510
You're right.

2994
02:55:46,670 --> 02:55:47,670
Let's go back to...

2995
02:55:47,670 --> 02:55:48,870
Let's go to Al's dream.

2996
02:55:51,490 --> 02:55:52,270
You know what?

2997
02:55:52,630 --> 02:55:53,570
Maybe you're right, Eeyore.

2998
02:55:53,690 --> 02:55:55,110
Let's go to Al's dream.

2999
02:55:58,610 --> 02:55:59,290
Toki.

3000
02:55:59,590 --> 02:56:00,650
Toki, no.

3001
02:56:01,150 --> 02:56:02,250
It's fine.

3002
02:56:09,050 --> 02:56:10,690
Help him, Toki.

3003
02:56:10,910 --> 02:56:12,990
After everything he's been through.

3004
02:56:13,170 --> 02:56:13,970
Color red.

3005
02:56:14,550 --> 02:56:16,150
Oh, I guess it's like the primary colors.

3006
02:56:16,710 --> 02:56:17,910
And then you, like, mix it up.

3007
02:56:24,320 --> 02:56:25,840
Alright, let's get these guys out.

3008
02:56:26,480 --> 02:56:27,220
I don't see them.

3009
02:56:27,560 --> 02:56:28,380
Oh, they're so far.

3010
02:56:29,220 --> 02:56:31,960
Okay, I need to actually kick some cookies.

3011
02:56:34,540 --> 02:56:36,060
Yeah, they're so...

3012
02:56:36,060 --> 02:56:36,980
tanky now.

3013
02:56:42,460 --> 02:56:43,320
Oh, come on.

3014
02:56:43,420 --> 02:56:43,700
Oh!

3015
02:56:43,880 --> 02:56:44,900
Wait, they're so fast!

3016
02:56:46,080 --> 02:56:46,900
Don't touch!

3017
02:56:49,000 --> 02:56:50,280
Oh my god, he was so fast.

3018
02:56:50,320 --> 02:56:51,080
Did you see that?

3019
02:56:51,740 --> 02:56:53,220
He, like, literally shimmied over.

3020
02:56:53,760 --> 02:56:54,800
Oh god, oh.

3021
02:56:55,720 --> 02:56:56,240
Okay.

3022
02:56:56,540 --> 02:56:57,780
I need more distance.

3023
02:56:58,820 --> 02:56:59,900
They run now, yeah.

3024
02:57:02,200 --> 02:57:07,400
I think when they're closer to you, uh, they, like, start running.

3025
02:57:08,060 --> 02:57:11,100
But because they're, like, so tanky too, it takes me faster.

3026
02:57:15,120 --> 02:57:16,440
Oh, please don't!

3027
02:57:18,220 --> 02:57:19,280
Please don't touch me!

3028
02:57:21,940 --> 02:57:23,640
Nick, thank you for the super chat!

3029
02:57:23,720 --> 02:57:24,840
Thank you, thank you!

3030
02:57:25,860 --> 02:57:26,700
Oh, that's a puzzle.

3031
02:57:28,300 --> 02:57:32,220
The three colors of Eeyore's dreams are black, grey, and black again.

3032
02:57:33,740 --> 02:57:34,740
I see it.

3033
02:57:40,160 --> 02:57:41,900
Oh, I just gotta push this.

3034
02:57:42,480 --> 02:57:43,980
Okay, so this would go here.

3035
02:57:47,140 --> 02:57:47,900
And then...

3036
02:57:47,900 --> 02:57:48,040
Move!

3037
02:57:49,780 --> 02:57:50,160
What?!

3038
02:57:50,160 --> 02:57:51,480
What do you mean you don't move?

3039
02:57:53,160 --> 02:57:56,040
Okay, if I move it here, and then push it here...

3040
02:57:56,040 --> 02:57:58,300
Are you serious?!

3041
02:57:58,850 --> 02:58:02,820
Okay, apparently it was too close, so I can't move him earlier, but I can move him here now.

3042
02:58:03,760 --> 02:58:05,340
Okay, and then I'll move this guy here.

3043
02:58:07,020 --> 02:58:09,780
But how do I know if this one's the sword and this one's the shield?

3044
02:58:10,400 --> 02:58:13,160
I know this one has to be here, because it's the only way.

3045
02:58:14,180 --> 02:58:14,940
Come on, go in.

3046
02:58:15,280 --> 02:58:16,120
I know you're supposed to go in.

3047
02:58:16,300 --> 02:58:16,820
Go in!

3048
02:58:17,580 --> 02:58:18,560
Where else would you go in?

3049
02:58:21,000 --> 02:58:22,120
Where else would you go in?

3050
02:58:22,140 --> 02:58:22,700
Go in!

3051
02:58:26,690 --> 02:58:27,590
Go- move!

3052
02:58:28,130 --> 02:58:28,910
There we go.

3053
02:58:31,850 --> 02:58:33,070
Okay, we got one.

3054
02:58:35,170 --> 02:58:36,350
What the fuck?

3055
02:58:36,590 --> 02:58:38,290
That's a Resident Evil sound.

3056
02:58:39,510 --> 02:58:42,150
What the- What the fuck?

3057
02:58:43,190 --> 02:58:43,870
Are you okay?

3058
02:58:43,910 --> 02:58:45,310
But does this go here, though?

3059
02:58:46,970 --> 02:58:48,270
Okay, I need to make sure.

3060
02:58:48,350 --> 02:58:50,670
Okay, no, it goes all the way back here, because there's a sword there.

3061
02:58:50,950 --> 02:58:51,910
I saw it.

3062
02:58:52,230 --> 02:58:53,310
What the fuck?

3063
02:58:54,150 --> 02:58:56,530
That sound effect is from Resident Evil!

3064
02:58:59,650 --> 02:59:01,050
Okay, we gotta push this here.

3065
02:59:02,570 --> 02:59:03,670
Alright, get in there, sword.

3066
02:59:04,610 --> 02:59:05,470
Get in there!

3067
02:59:07,330 --> 02:59:07,750
Okay.

3068
02:59:07,750 --> 02:59:07,870
Okay.

3069
02:59:09,830 --> 02:59:10,430
Please.

3070
02:59:12,170 --> 02:59:12,770
Please.

3071
02:59:13,730 --> 02:59:17,170
Maybe if I look around- turn around and rush back in.

3072
02:59:17,610 --> 02:59:18,330
Alright, nice.

3073
02:59:19,810 --> 02:59:21,010
Resident Piglet.

3074
02:59:22,770 --> 02:59:24,170
Mmm, I hate that.

3075
02:59:24,310 --> 02:59:25,390
I hate that sound effect.

3076
02:59:27,250 --> 02:59:29,250
I think it's like Onimushu, too.

3077
02:59:29,510 --> 02:59:31,390
Or Onimusha sound effects, too.

3078
02:59:32,570 --> 02:59:33,170
Get in.

3079
02:59:33,430 --> 02:59:34,290
Shield time.

3080
02:59:34,290 --> 02:59:34,490
Get in.

3081
02:59:36,690 --> 02:59:45,250
I think it feels like- Okay, you played the other levels, this level literally is like so different compared to everything else.

3082
02:59:46,810 --> 02:59:47,490
Like...

3083
02:59:48,270 --> 02:59:49,470
I don't understand.

3084
02:59:49,790 --> 02:59:53,850
They gave this specific level to a different development team.

3085
02:59:53,910 --> 02:59:54,830
There's like no way.

3086
03:00:04,590 --> 03:00:06,330
Wait, where-

3087
03:00:12,570 --> 03:00:13,470
Wait, what?

3088
03:00:14,650 --> 03:00:17,750
Where did- Where did that door come from?

3089
03:00:22,550 --> 03:00:24,430
Where did that door even come from?

3090
03:00:24,490 --> 03:00:25,630
It's not from here.

3091
03:00:30,330 --> 03:00:32,050
Where did that open from?

3092
03:00:35,870 --> 03:00:37,510
I need to start kicking stuff.

3093
03:00:37,650 --> 03:00:38,910
I just realized- oh, there we go.

3094
03:00:39,910 --> 03:00:42,970
Sorry I kicked the painting of your great-great-grandfather.

3095
03:00:43,970 --> 03:00:45,070
But I need these cookies.

3096
03:00:45,290 --> 03:00:47,730
I am very short on cookies right now.

3097
03:00:48,190 --> 03:00:49,890
I really need a lot of cookies.

3098
03:00:50,810 --> 03:00:52,370
Okay, what other things can I kick?

3099
03:00:52,550 --> 03:00:52,970
Can I kick that?

3100
03:00:56,700 --> 03:00:59,640
Alright, I don't know where that door opened.

3101
03:01:06,240 --> 03:01:07,700
Where did that door open?

3102
03:01:10,340 --> 03:01:11,980
No, we're not gonna kick Eeyore.

3103
03:01:11,980 --> 03:01:13,200
He's been through a lot.

3104
03:01:13,740 --> 03:01:15,660
Guys, that's fucked.

3105
03:01:16,860 --> 03:01:19,300
Jesus Christ, what is this chair art?

3106
03:01:22,880 --> 03:01:24,300
Oh, it's in the yellow!

3107
03:01:26,720 --> 03:01:27,340
Okay.

3108
03:01:27,620 --> 03:01:31,260
Okay, that chair artwork is actually pretty creepy.

3109
03:01:35,200 --> 03:01:36,720
That's pretty creepy.

3110
03:01:38,540 --> 03:01:39,200
Alright.

3111
03:01:39,860 --> 03:01:43,200
Oh my god, I wish I could like pick stronger attacks.

3112
03:01:49,970 --> 03:01:50,570
Okay.

3113
03:01:51,210 --> 03:01:52,950
Oh no, he's running.

3114
03:01:58,340 --> 03:01:59,860
Rob, thank you for the super chat!

3115
03:01:59,980 --> 03:02:00,780
Thank you, thank you!

3116
03:02:01,480 --> 03:02:07,220
It's the last hour of B-Day, so I'll spend it watching your stream!

3117
03:02:08,780 --> 03:02:09,960
What the fuck?

3118
03:02:10,780 --> 03:02:12,560
Who the fuck is he?

3119
03:02:17,420 --> 03:02:18,580
Who is he?

3120
03:02:19,340 --> 03:02:20,220
A new enemy!

3121
03:02:21,520 --> 03:02:22,080
Oh!

3122
03:02:22,420 --> 03:02:22,820
Wait!

3123
03:02:23,020 --> 03:02:24,740
Oh, wait, wait, wait a minute!

3124
03:02:25,400 --> 03:02:26,960
He can flip my screen?!

3125
03:02:29,600 --> 03:02:30,980
Oh my god, wait, okay.

3126
03:02:31,600 --> 03:02:32,220
Give me a sec.

3127
03:02:32,580 --> 03:02:33,780
Oh shit, okay.

3128
03:02:34,960 --> 03:02:36,280
It's fine, it's fine.

3129
03:02:37,340 --> 03:02:38,120
Wait, that's illegal!

3130
03:02:40,780 --> 03:02:41,820
Oh, okay.

3131
03:02:46,300 --> 03:02:47,640
Happy birthday, Rob!

3132
03:02:48,740 --> 03:02:50,420
Happy birthday to you!

3133
03:02:50,760 --> 03:02:52,140
Happy birthday to you!

3134
03:02:52,360 --> 03:02:53,840
Happy birthday to you, Rob!

3135
03:02:54,260 --> 03:02:55,580
Happy birthday to you!

3136
03:02:56,900 --> 03:02:58,120
That's so fucking illegal.

3137
03:02:59,500 --> 03:03:00,540
Oh, I guess I have to...

3138
03:03:00,540 --> 03:03:01,700
Oh, I pushed that over here.

3139
03:03:04,920 --> 03:03:06,080
I think like...

3140
03:03:06,880 --> 03:03:07,920
He like...

3141
03:03:07,920 --> 03:03:11,120
If you do the move when he's holding...

3142
03:03:11,120 --> 03:03:13,320
Okay, the worst part about this is that you can't hold.

3143
03:03:14,160 --> 03:03:14,760
That's...

3144
03:03:16,340 --> 03:03:17,860
That's literally the worst part.

3145
03:03:18,080 --> 03:03:19,400
I have to like...

3146
03:03:19,400 --> 03:03:20,520
Just mash X.

3147
03:03:23,120 --> 03:03:24,120
How is this for children?

3148
03:03:24,320 --> 03:03:24,800
Exactly.

3149
03:03:26,220 --> 03:03:26,820
Exactly.

3150
03:03:27,560 --> 03:03:29,780
That's why I did not finish this game.

3151
03:03:30,340 --> 03:03:35,340
I made more progress in Kingdom Hearts than I did for this game.

3152
03:03:35,520 --> 03:03:36,780
That's how sad it was.

3153
03:03:37,080 --> 03:03:44,250
What did I unlock?

3154
03:03:45,130 --> 03:03:47,230
Sometimes it's like, what did I unlock?

3155
03:03:56,980 --> 03:03:57,400
Alright.

3156
03:03:59,660 --> 03:04:00,140
Um...

3157
03:04:00,140 --> 03:04:01,920
Because Kingdom Hearts wasn't that scary.

3158
03:04:02,280 --> 03:04:06,060
At best, the only thing that scared me a lot was... Oh, shit.

3159
03:04:06,540 --> 03:04:07,760
Was, um...

3160
03:04:07,760 --> 03:04:09,820
What's the first town called in Kingdom Hearts?

3161
03:04:09,900 --> 03:04:11,480
The one with the Final Fantasy characters?

3162
03:04:13,300 --> 03:04:16,480
I hated that town because like the Heartless would show up.

3163
03:04:16,880 --> 03:04:21,020
It's like, it wouldn't say it scared me, but like, I did not enjoy it.

3164
03:04:21,020 --> 03:04:22,000
Oh, this is the soundtrack.

3165
03:04:22,200 --> 03:04:24,200
I didn't enjoy it because there was no safe...

3166
03:04:24,200 --> 03:04:25,160
Yeah, Traverse Town.

3167
03:04:25,260 --> 03:04:27,160
I hated Traverse Town because...

3168
03:04:27,940 --> 03:04:28,460
Um...

3169
03:04:29,020 --> 03:04:33,640
I was always like spooked out about it because Heartless would like randomly show up.

3170
03:04:37,460 --> 03:04:40,620
I didn't like it because like there was no safe spot.

3171
03:04:42,940 --> 03:04:44,700
Yeah, it was like empty and eerie.

3172
03:04:45,080 --> 03:04:45,360
Yeah.

3173
03:04:46,460 --> 03:04:47,200
Wait, what?

3174
03:04:48,720 --> 03:04:49,860
Where am I?

3175
03:04:50,300 --> 03:04:53,240
And this is where the Rising Evil zombie shows up.

3176
03:04:54,040 --> 03:04:55,320
It goes, ooga booga booga.

3177
03:04:57,040 --> 03:04:58,120
Oh my God.

3178
03:04:58,160 --> 03:05:00,500
I can't see anything that's going on.

3179
03:05:05,120 --> 03:05:06,000
Oh my God!

3180
03:05:07,540 --> 03:05:08,940
Oh my God.

3181
03:05:09,140 --> 03:05:10,020
Heffalumps and losers?

3182
03:05:11,960 --> 03:05:12,380
Where?

3183
03:05:12,380 --> 03:05:12,980
Where?

3184
03:05:15,180 --> 03:05:16,600
Wait, where's the Heffalumps?

3185
03:05:17,740 --> 03:05:19,280
Where's the Heffalumps?

3186
03:05:20,660 --> 03:05:21,700
Oh, there he is.

3187
03:05:21,760 --> 03:05:22,840
Okay, it's just one guy.

3188
03:05:25,220 --> 03:05:26,360
It's just one guy.

3189
03:05:27,800 --> 03:05:28,680
It's fine.

3190
03:05:30,580 --> 03:05:32,000
Oh yeah, this was like Resident Evil.

3191
03:05:32,160 --> 03:05:33,240
This is like the dog.

3192
03:05:33,800 --> 03:05:34,540
It's the dogs!

3193
03:05:40,420 --> 03:05:41,700
Okay, that should be it.

3194
03:05:47,960 --> 03:05:48,440
Okay.

3195
03:05:49,300 --> 03:05:50,160
Oh, fuck!

3196
03:05:53,480 --> 03:05:55,660
How was I supposed to know there was more?

3197
03:05:57,780 --> 03:05:58,260
Okay.

3198
03:05:58,800 --> 03:06:00,000
Let's get him out of the way.

3199
03:06:04,140 --> 03:06:04,540
Okay.

3200
03:06:05,720 --> 03:06:07,320
I really need a new face.

3201
03:06:08,160 --> 03:06:09,360
There's too tanky now.

3202
03:06:10,920 --> 03:06:12,900
Oh, oh, no, no, no.

3203
03:06:13,060 --> 03:06:14,560
Okay, we're fine, we're fine, we're fine.

3204
03:06:16,200 --> 03:06:16,880
Okay.

3205
03:06:16,880 --> 03:06:17,740
That's right, shrink!

3206
03:06:18,440 --> 03:06:19,740
That's right, shrink!

3207
03:06:19,960 --> 03:06:20,780
You're nobody!

3208
03:06:22,320 --> 03:06:23,600
Okay, maybe there's cookies?

3209
03:06:24,320 --> 03:06:25,140
Yay, cookies!

3210
03:06:28,220 --> 03:06:28,900
Cookies!

3211
03:06:30,860 --> 03:06:32,420
Okay, that has to give me cookies.

3212
03:06:33,080 --> 03:06:34,280
Yay, cookies!

3213
03:06:35,900 --> 03:06:36,840
Okay, I'll cook you.

3214
03:06:37,720 --> 03:06:40,420
That was literally yours money right there.

3215
03:06:41,140 --> 03:06:42,640
Yay, free cookies!

3216
03:06:43,540 --> 03:06:44,460
It's okay.

3217
03:06:45,080 --> 03:06:46,040
Eeyore doesn't need them.

3218
03:06:46,840 --> 03:06:48,160
He has a house now.

3219
03:06:48,900 --> 03:06:50,020
I mean, look at him!

3220
03:06:50,060 --> 03:06:51,380
He's clearly rich!

3221
03:06:51,520 --> 03:06:52,600
Look at where he lives!

3222
03:06:53,020 --> 03:06:54,000
He just doesn't have color!

3223
03:06:58,340 --> 03:07:00,620
What'd I do with the bottle opener, though?

3224
03:07:06,650 --> 03:07:07,970
Hell no, he won't notice.

3225
03:07:08,610 --> 03:07:11,410
He won't even notice they're gone, chat.

3226
03:07:12,350 --> 03:07:14,970
He won't even notice, guys.

3227
03:07:14,970 --> 03:07:16,790
He doesn't need these cookies!

3228
03:07:17,730 --> 03:07:20,710
He has like a million other problems to worry about!

3229
03:07:21,390 --> 03:07:24,170
Like, what is he gonna do with these cookies?

3230
03:07:25,730 --> 03:07:29,270
Like, first off, he doesn't have to worry about food.

3231
03:07:30,450 --> 03:07:32,270
Is there a big bottle in the other room?

3232
03:07:36,360 --> 03:07:37,780
There was a big bottle?

3233
03:07:38,480 --> 03:07:39,740
I didn't even notice it.

3234
03:07:46,400 --> 03:07:48,280
That's the last good thing.

3235
03:07:48,460 --> 03:07:50,140
He has so many cookies!

3236
03:07:51,480 --> 03:07:52,800
The first one?

3237
03:07:53,160 --> 03:07:53,640
This one?

3238
03:07:53,940 --> 03:07:55,360
I don't remember there being a bottle.

3239
03:07:56,060 --> 03:07:57,080
Is there a bottle?

3240
03:07:58,400 --> 03:07:59,500
I don't remember.

3241
03:08:00,440 --> 03:08:01,160
I'll go look.

3242
03:08:03,240 --> 03:08:03,620
I just...

3243
03:08:03,620 --> 03:08:04,060
Oh!

3244
03:08:04,240 --> 03:08:05,320
The giant bottle!

3245
03:08:05,460 --> 03:08:09,900
I thought you were talking about wine!

3246
03:08:10,380 --> 03:08:12,760
I was like, that's not wine!

3247
03:08:14,380 --> 03:08:15,060
There we go.

3248
03:08:15,140 --> 03:08:16,360
He's gonna have red at least.

3249
03:08:20,140 --> 03:08:21,660
Do I have to catch it, too?

3250
03:08:24,100 --> 03:08:24,720
Ah, fuck.

3251
03:08:24,820 --> 03:08:25,760
Okay, where is he gonna go?

3252
03:08:27,480 --> 03:08:28,660
Ah, this is fucked up.

3253
03:08:29,700 --> 03:08:30,220
Okay.

3254
03:08:30,900 --> 03:08:31,840
I caught it.

3255
03:08:32,840 --> 03:08:33,360
Yay!

3256
03:08:33,940 --> 03:08:34,740
We did it!

3257
03:08:34,820 --> 03:08:35,620
Wait, I'm here now.

3258
03:08:37,260 --> 03:08:38,540
We did it, Eeyore!

3259
03:08:38,860 --> 03:08:40,600
I found the first color!

3260
03:08:41,480 --> 03:08:43,360
We're gonna fix your depression!

3261
03:08:44,960 --> 03:08:46,520
It's that easy, Eeyore!

3262
03:08:46,520 --> 03:08:48,020
It's just that easy!

3263
03:08:50,500 --> 03:08:51,540
Eeyore, look!

3264
03:08:52,440 --> 03:08:54,160
One color at a time!

3265
03:08:55,360 --> 03:08:57,080
A color of blood!

3266
03:08:59,320 --> 03:09:01,480
Oh, you're right.

3267
03:09:01,860 --> 03:09:03,640
Just stop while I'm ahead, right?

3268
03:09:04,100 --> 03:09:05,680
I'll use the bathroom real quick, guys.

3269
03:09:05,740 --> 03:09:06,300
I'll be right back.

3270
03:10:41,480 --> 03:10:42,320
I'm back.

3271
03:10:42,940 --> 03:10:45,300
I still can't believe the nurse was like, it's not urgent enough.

3272
03:10:45,300 --> 03:10:46,520
You gotta fucking...

3273
03:10:48,000 --> 03:10:50,020
I'm still thinking about it.

3274
03:10:50,040 --> 03:10:50,820
I just got a cough job.

3275
03:10:51,240 --> 03:10:53,480
I'm like, I'm sorry, it's not urgent enough.

3276
03:10:53,520 --> 03:10:56,620
So you gotta fucking make an appointment at a walk-in clinic.

3277
03:10:56,740 --> 03:10:57,660
Because they don't do appointments.

3278
03:10:57,720 --> 03:10:58,460
They don't walk in.

3279
03:10:58,540 --> 03:10:59,220
You can't walk in.

3280
03:11:01,480 --> 03:11:03,560
They didn't even write me a fucking prescription!

3281
03:11:10,420 --> 03:11:11,880
Like, what is this?

3282
03:11:12,820 --> 03:11:14,080
What is this?

3283
03:11:16,540 --> 03:11:18,300
What the fuck is this?

3284
03:11:18,760 --> 03:11:19,380
Level design!

3285
03:11:22,600 --> 03:11:23,120
Okay.

3286
03:11:23,520 --> 03:11:25,720
We gotta fix this painting.

3287
03:11:28,700 --> 03:11:29,960
Wait, wait, wait.

3288
03:11:30,080 --> 03:11:30,420
What?

3289
03:11:30,860 --> 03:11:31,980
Everything is timed?

3290
03:11:32,080 --> 03:11:32,820
I'm so slow!

3291
03:11:37,860 --> 03:11:38,940
Yeah, that's what I'm saying!

3292
03:11:39,020 --> 03:11:40,620
That's literally Resident Evil 1 statue.

3293
03:11:41,080 --> 03:11:42,220
Oh my god, please, please, please.

3294
03:11:42,220 --> 03:11:44,220
I don't want to do well with pressure, please.

3295
03:11:49,740 --> 03:11:51,320
It's on the other side!

3296
03:11:51,920 --> 03:11:52,260
No!

3297
03:11:53,960 --> 03:11:55,380
Okay, that's fine, we did it.

3298
03:11:55,680 --> 03:11:56,380
That's the last one.

3299
03:11:57,420 --> 03:11:59,000
It has to be the last one.

3300
03:12:03,010 --> 03:12:04,950
Eeyore admires the human form.

3301
03:12:08,250 --> 03:12:10,330
Why is he dreaming about this?

3302
03:12:11,450 --> 03:12:12,450
Where's me?

3303
03:12:13,390 --> 03:12:16,770
And also, Eeyore, where's me?

3304
03:12:20,170 --> 03:12:21,210
Oh yeah!

3305
03:12:21,730 --> 03:12:23,150
All his best friends!

3306
03:12:23,490 --> 03:12:27,210
Pooh Bear, Owl, Tigger, Rabbit.

3307
03:12:27,490 --> 03:12:28,090
Where's me?

3308
03:12:30,170 --> 03:12:31,890
Bro, what the fuck, man?

3309
03:12:32,590 --> 03:12:34,450
I'm trying to make you less depressed.

3310
03:12:34,450 --> 03:12:34,910
Oh!

3311
03:12:38,200 --> 03:12:39,210
He's a child!

3312
03:12:39,570 --> 03:12:41,370
I don't think Eeyore wants to be friends with a kid.

3313
03:12:46,690 --> 03:12:47,810
That's fucked.

3314
03:12:48,990 --> 03:12:49,570
I see.

3315
03:12:49,910 --> 03:12:50,790
I see.

3316
03:12:51,410 --> 03:12:53,770
I see how it is, Eeyore.

3317
03:12:55,690 --> 03:12:57,570
I see how it is.

3318
03:13:00,310 --> 03:13:02,650
I fucking see how it is.

3319
03:13:04,450 --> 03:13:04,770
Why?

3320
03:13:04,970 --> 03:13:05,270
Oh!

3321
03:13:11,990 --> 03:13:14,450
If I turn everything off...

3322
03:13:17,050 --> 03:13:18,450
Maybe it'll like...

3323
03:13:21,850 --> 03:13:23,930
And then, there has to be one more over here.

3324
03:13:24,470 --> 03:13:25,810
Yeah, yeah, if I turn this off...

3325
03:13:25,810 --> 03:13:27,870
And then the fountain is gonna stop working.

3326
03:13:30,690 --> 03:13:31,090
Okay.

3327
03:13:31,090 --> 03:13:31,210
Okay.

3328
03:13:32,770 --> 03:13:34,130
And it's gonna explode.

3329
03:13:34,810 --> 03:13:37,850
And now Eeyore's gonna have plumbing issues and he's gonna be homeless again.

3330
03:13:40,920 --> 03:13:41,320
Yay!

3331
03:13:44,080 --> 03:13:45,220
He didn't see me.

3332
03:13:47,000 --> 03:13:48,040
He's like, what?

3333
03:13:51,160 --> 03:13:52,040
Is it?

3334
03:13:55,310 --> 03:13:56,210
How do I...

3335
03:13:56,750 --> 03:13:57,950
Grab this then?

3336
03:13:59,270 --> 03:14:00,190
Wait, who's here?

3337
03:14:00,190 --> 03:14:00,270
Who's here?

3338
03:14:03,830 --> 03:14:04,450
Okay.

3339
03:14:04,870 --> 03:14:06,010
Get out of here.

3340
03:14:07,510 --> 03:14:08,130
Yay!

3341
03:14:08,730 --> 03:14:10,770
Eeyore's gonna have financial issues!

3342
03:14:11,550 --> 03:14:12,490
Oh shit.

3343
03:14:12,670 --> 03:14:14,250
Okay, now he's like really close.

3344
03:14:15,030 --> 03:14:16,530
I think I have to do one more too.

3345
03:14:17,310 --> 03:14:17,650
Yeah.

3346
03:14:17,990 --> 03:14:19,250
No, no, no, no, no!

3347
03:14:19,470 --> 03:14:20,890
No touch!

3348
03:14:21,810 --> 03:14:22,430
No!

3349
03:14:27,420 --> 03:14:28,660
You're so mean!

3350
03:14:29,820 --> 03:14:31,360
Wait, there's another one?

3351
03:14:32,340 --> 03:14:33,400
Oh my god.

3352
03:14:33,480 --> 03:14:34,920
Fuck, it's the green man!

3353
03:14:40,240 --> 03:14:40,680
Okay.

3354
03:14:41,020 --> 03:14:42,920
Just gotta make sure he...

3355
03:14:42,920 --> 03:14:44,180
He doesn't close his eyes.

3356
03:14:46,880 --> 03:14:49,100
Bro, why are we Luigi Manchu right now?

3357
03:14:49,120 --> 03:14:51,300
Just how twisted and messed up is this?

3358
03:14:51,400 --> 03:14:53,500
Is Eeyore's mental state...

3359
03:15:00,120 --> 03:15:00,520
Okay.

3360
03:15:01,340 --> 03:15:02,420
No, what did he say?

3361
03:15:02,520 --> 03:15:03,600
What did the narrator say?

3362
03:15:04,220 --> 03:15:04,860
I don't know...

3363
03:15:05,640 --> 03:15:07,240
I don't know if like...

3364
03:15:07,240 --> 03:15:09,340
If it resets their HP.

3365
03:15:10,080 --> 03:15:10,960
So if it resets their...

3366
03:15:10,960 --> 03:15:11,900
Oh, it doesn't, thank god.

3367
03:15:12,400 --> 03:15:13,060
Oh, thank god.

3368
03:15:15,080 --> 03:15:18,020
For real though, what in the core of that is this?

3369
03:15:18,400 --> 03:15:18,920
Is Eeyore?

3370
03:15:25,300 --> 03:15:27,860
Bro, get it out of his head.

3371
03:15:31,140 --> 03:15:31,940
Yeah, how?

3372
03:15:32,500 --> 03:15:34,420
Okay, maybe if I go to the other room?

3373
03:15:34,700 --> 03:15:35,600
To the first room.

3374
03:15:35,700 --> 03:15:36,620
And it'll figure it out.

3375
03:15:36,860 --> 03:15:39,140
Okay, I have the cog to turn down the water.

3376
03:15:39,420 --> 03:15:40,100
And I'll get blue.

3377
03:15:40,580 --> 03:15:42,220
Okay, I gotta talk to Christopher.

3378
03:15:43,340 --> 03:15:45,200
And then he'll tell me not to be sad anymore.

3379
03:15:45,380 --> 03:15:46,660
And then I'll be not sad.

3380
03:15:47,040 --> 03:15:48,840
See, Eeyore, it works for me!

3381
03:15:49,280 --> 03:15:52,060
I can't, I can't listen to him say that same thing again.

3382
03:15:52,060 --> 03:15:54,480
Like, I assume that like...

3383
03:15:54,480 --> 03:15:56,460
You know, they recorded like...

3384
03:15:56,460 --> 03:15:58,040
Seven dialogue...

3385
03:15:58,040 --> 03:15:59,860
Dialogue options for...

3386
03:15:59,860 --> 03:16:00,900
Christopher Robin.

3387
03:16:01,640 --> 03:16:03,220
You would assume that.

3388
03:16:03,620 --> 03:16:06,480
Because like, you know, you're gonna be meeting some...

3389
03:16:06,480 --> 03:16:08,720
As a child, you're gonna be meeting some...

3390
03:16:08,720 --> 03:16:09,520
Cheering up.

3391
03:16:09,840 --> 03:16:11,520
For a while.

3392
03:16:13,420 --> 03:16:15,640
But he literally says one thing.

3393
03:16:15,720 --> 03:16:17,340
And it's literally like, get over it.

3394
03:16:17,440 --> 03:16:18,400
Stop being sad.

3395
03:16:18,400 --> 03:16:18,520
Stop being sad.

3396
03:16:20,840 --> 03:16:23,700
And there's like other motivation speeches he can say.

3397
03:16:24,700 --> 03:16:25,980
Okay, we got yellow now.

3398
03:16:26,520 --> 03:16:27,700
We gotta pick up yellow.

3399
03:16:30,900 --> 03:16:31,620
Is it like...

3400
03:16:31,620 --> 03:16:33,620
Who was the voice actor for...

3401
03:16:33,620 --> 03:16:34,780
Christopher Robin?

3402
03:16:35,320 --> 03:16:36,220
Someone said it was like...

3403
03:16:37,780 --> 03:16:39,860
Someone said it was like McGregor.

3404
03:16:40,240 --> 03:16:42,220
Was it actually...

3405
03:16:42,220 --> 03:16:43,220
Him as a kid?

3406
03:16:44,920 --> 03:16:46,760
I was gonna say his voice acting...

3407
03:16:46,760 --> 03:16:47,080
Was way too expensive.

3408
03:16:49,260 --> 03:16:49,820
Whoever...

3409
03:16:49,820 --> 03:16:53,020
Whoever is Christopher Robin's voice actor...

3410
03:16:53,020 --> 03:16:54,060
Way too fucking expensive.

3411
03:16:54,220 --> 03:16:55,580
They made him record one line.

3412
03:16:55,900 --> 03:16:57,560
No, they made him record two lines.

3413
03:16:57,900 --> 03:17:01,120
The first line was like...

3414
03:17:01,120 --> 03:17:02,920
Silly piglet, you're just crazy.

3415
03:17:03,140 --> 03:17:04,080
There's nobody here.

3416
03:17:05,760 --> 03:17:06,880
And then...

3417
03:17:06,880 --> 03:17:08,000
Second one was...

3418
03:17:08,000 --> 03:17:09,160
Stop being sad.

3419
03:17:13,380 --> 03:17:16,040
That's everything they gave Christopher Robin.

3420
03:17:16,320 --> 03:17:18,680
That's literally all his dialogue.

3421
03:17:20,700 --> 03:17:22,360
Grow up, piglet.

3422
03:17:24,800 --> 03:17:25,200
Alright.

3423
03:17:25,660 --> 03:17:26,500
Open sesame.

3424
03:17:38,440 --> 03:17:39,560
Violin room.

3425
03:17:39,700 --> 03:17:40,580
Who lives here?

3426
03:17:41,860 --> 03:17:42,460
Oh.

3427
03:17:45,100 --> 03:17:45,700
Oh.

3428
03:17:48,140 --> 03:17:50,840
Wait, can I buy a cookie?

3429
03:17:52,960 --> 03:17:54,360
How much money do I have?

3430
03:17:55,060 --> 03:17:55,500
Kick.

3431
03:17:56,540 --> 03:17:57,920
How much money do I have?

3432
03:17:58,220 --> 03:18:00,140
I do not have a lot of money.

3433
03:18:01,700 --> 03:18:02,740
Why am I...

3434
03:18:02,740 --> 03:18:04,220
Broke in Eeyore's world?

3435
03:18:05,860 --> 03:18:07,200
Eeyore, where the fuck...

3436
03:18:07,200 --> 03:18:08,180
Is all your money?

3437
03:18:11,020 --> 03:18:12,400
Eeyore, where is your money?

3438
03:18:12,540 --> 03:18:13,920
Eeyore, where is your money?

3439
03:18:16,100 --> 03:18:18,400
We should be close to 90.

3440
03:18:19,000 --> 03:18:21,300
There's like two faces I can buy here.

3441
03:18:22,360 --> 03:18:24,940
I don't have enough fucking music.

3442
03:18:25,240 --> 03:18:25,760
Not music.

3443
03:18:26,100 --> 03:18:27,620
I don't have enough money for it though.

3444
03:18:28,980 --> 03:18:30,680
I don't like this.

3445
03:18:34,760 --> 03:18:38,360
Yeah, that's the piano BGM.

3446
03:18:38,360 --> 03:18:40,280
Okay, I'm like...

3447
03:18:40,280 --> 03:18:41,320
I'm like four away.

3448
03:18:41,920 --> 03:18:43,220
I think I kicked everything.

3449
03:18:44,140 --> 03:18:45,660
Yeah, we gotta get the music pieces.

3450
03:18:49,500 --> 03:18:51,540
What the fuck are...

3451
03:18:56,260 --> 03:18:57,980
He didn't skip leg day.

3452
03:18:58,820 --> 03:19:01,760
He did not skip leg day.

3453
03:19:01,940 --> 03:19:02,780
That's for sure.

3454
03:19:03,280 --> 03:19:04,560
What the fuck?

3455
03:19:05,780 --> 03:19:06,900
Those legs.

3456
03:19:06,900 --> 03:19:08,340
Bro, he's like...

3457
03:19:08,340 --> 03:19:09,160
Do you see those thighs?

3458
03:19:11,140 --> 03:19:12,760
Do you see those thighs?

3459
03:19:15,560 --> 03:19:16,840
Holy shit.

3460
03:19:17,440 --> 03:19:18,500
Those are some...

3461
03:19:18,500 --> 03:19:20,740
Fucking thick thighs there.

3462
03:19:25,810 --> 03:19:27,370
God, Eeyore.

3463
03:19:27,410 --> 03:19:28,730
What are you dreaming of?

3464
03:19:29,570 --> 03:19:29,930
Okay.

3465
03:19:30,670 --> 03:19:32,730
Eeyore's been dreaming up some...

3466
03:19:33,470 --> 03:19:35,230
Okay, I don't know if you guys noticed this.

3467
03:19:35,670 --> 03:19:37,770
But this is all in Eeyore's head.

3468
03:19:37,770 --> 03:19:38,750
By the way.

3469
03:19:38,870 --> 03:19:42,910
This is all in his head.

3470
03:19:44,310 --> 03:19:48,250
I think he's been thinking about some things.

3471
03:19:54,960 --> 03:19:56,660
No, it's not issues.

3472
03:19:56,900 --> 03:19:58,420
He just...

3473
03:19:58,420 --> 03:20:00,510
He's an appreciator.

3474
03:20:04,060 --> 03:20:07,000
He appreciates certain parts.

3475
03:20:10,330 --> 03:20:12,210
He knows what he likes.

3476
03:20:19,830 --> 03:20:20,450
Okay.

3477
03:20:21,400 --> 03:20:22,470
Gotta scare him.

3478
03:20:24,130 --> 03:20:24,950
Yeah, cry.

3479
03:20:25,770 --> 03:20:26,910
Tell your mama.

3480
03:20:27,370 --> 03:20:28,210
That's right.

3481
03:20:28,450 --> 03:20:28,710
Cry!

3482
03:20:35,150 --> 03:20:35,770
Doki.

3483
03:20:36,210 --> 03:20:37,710
Doki, he has a rub.

3484
03:20:37,730 --> 03:20:38,650
Let him have this.

3485
03:20:41,880 --> 03:20:43,730
Doki, just let him have this!

3486
03:20:45,330 --> 03:20:47,250
I'm not saying...

3487
03:20:47,920 --> 03:20:49,930
Okay, I am judging him a little bit.

3488
03:20:49,930 --> 03:20:52,170
I am judging him a little bit.

3489
03:20:52,170 --> 03:20:54,090
He doesn't even have arms.

3490
03:20:57,690 --> 03:20:59,030
Okay, I got more cookies.

3491
03:21:01,370 --> 03:21:03,450
Does it mean I have all the cookies in this...

3492
03:21:03,450 --> 03:21:06,310
Oh, I guess that means I have all the cookies in this room.

3493
03:21:07,030 --> 03:21:07,470
I think.

3494
03:21:10,150 --> 03:21:12,230
Yeah, I'm just trying to get nine cookies.

3495
03:21:13,350 --> 03:21:15,610
So I can at least unlock one more face.

3496
03:21:19,990 --> 03:21:23,990
I have two faces to unlock here, but I can't afford it.

3497
03:21:26,390 --> 03:21:29,090
I guess if I kick this, I should be able to, right?

3498
03:21:32,570 --> 03:21:33,450
73, 74.

3499
03:21:34,290 --> 03:21:35,870
Okay, this has to be able to kick.

3500
03:21:36,050 --> 03:21:36,750
Yeah, I fucking knew.

3501
03:21:36,810 --> 03:21:38,290
I knew that's where you hide your stash.

3502
03:21:38,770 --> 03:21:45,010
I knew an addict like you, a cookie addict like you, I know where your stash is.

3503
03:21:45,510 --> 03:21:46,730
You can't hide from me.

3504
03:21:47,730 --> 03:21:49,030
That's fucking right.

3505
03:21:49,670 --> 03:21:50,590
Pay up.

3506
03:21:52,770 --> 03:21:53,930
Alright, nice.

3507
03:21:54,950 --> 03:21:56,630
Okay, we just need...

3508
03:21:56,630 --> 03:21:57,450
eight more.

3509
03:21:58,610 --> 03:22:00,230
I mean, all of these should be it.

3510
03:22:00,290 --> 03:22:00,470
Yeah.

3511
03:22:04,130 --> 03:22:04,670
Alright.

3512
03:22:05,590 --> 03:22:07,270
And then this should be the last one.

3513
03:22:10,230 --> 03:22:13,010
Okay, at least we can afford one more face.

3514
03:22:13,510 --> 03:22:14,310
That's good.

3515
03:22:14,310 --> 03:22:16,490
Alright, then we tickle the statue.

3516
03:22:17,810 --> 03:22:19,170
Tickle, tickle!

3517
03:22:19,950 --> 03:22:20,950
What?

3518
03:22:22,010 --> 03:22:23,010
What?

3519
03:22:23,510 --> 03:22:26,470
Why are there...

3520
03:22:32,350 --> 03:22:35,010
I have to catch it.

3521
03:22:44,310 --> 03:22:45,710
Oh my god.

3522
03:22:45,850 --> 03:22:47,970
Why is it so fast?

3523
03:22:48,670 --> 03:22:50,530
I got a quarter cap him.

3524
03:22:53,050 --> 03:22:53,770
Alright.

3525
03:22:54,270 --> 03:22:56,070
Yes, we got it.

3526
03:22:59,420 --> 03:23:02,180
Okay, this definitely had a different team part of it.

3527
03:23:03,400 --> 03:23:04,120
This...

3528
03:23:05,580 --> 03:23:09,460
The different team definitely developed this specific level.

3529
03:23:12,120 --> 03:23:12,840
Yours...

3530
03:23:12,840 --> 03:23:14,980
Oh Eeyore, we have all the colors!

3531
03:23:18,140 --> 03:23:20,100
Where did you get green?

3532
03:23:25,640 --> 03:23:25,820
What?

3533
03:23:38,640 --> 03:23:39,440
Visitors?

3534
03:23:46,920 --> 03:23:47,720
Visitors?

3535
03:23:47,720 --> 03:23:48,360
Who?

3536
03:23:49,280 --> 03:23:50,180
Wait, what?

3537
03:23:50,760 --> 03:23:51,600
Who, Eeyore?

3538
03:23:51,920 --> 03:23:54,860
Oh, you don't want to tell me who?

3539
03:23:55,000 --> 03:23:57,580
That's alright, guess we're not good enough friends, I guess.

3540
03:24:05,280 --> 03:24:06,560
His demons.

3541
03:24:09,900 --> 03:24:10,340
Jesus.

3542
03:24:16,750 --> 03:24:17,390
Oh, nice.

3543
03:24:17,810 --> 03:24:19,710
Piglet finally got another move.

3544
03:24:20,230 --> 03:24:22,690
We finally use another move now.

3545
03:24:23,910 --> 03:24:24,270
Can we take this?

3546
03:24:24,510 --> 03:24:24,750
No.

3547
03:24:25,490 --> 03:24:27,810
Okay, we gotta go to Rue.

3548
03:24:28,070 --> 03:24:30,670
Hey Rue, Eeyore doesn't have you in his, like, museum.

3549
03:24:31,550 --> 03:24:32,710
Because he doesn't care about you.

3550
03:24:32,770 --> 03:24:34,050
But can we borrow your lamp?

3551
03:24:35,690 --> 03:24:36,130
Oh.

3552
03:24:36,710 --> 03:24:38,290
Oh, they're all colors now.

3553
03:24:40,190 --> 03:24:41,610
Oh, I don't like this.

3554
03:24:41,910 --> 03:24:42,830
I hate this.

3555
03:24:42,890 --> 03:24:45,190
Oh, this camera angle is so unsettling.

3556
03:24:46,150 --> 03:24:46,670
What?

3557
03:24:48,650 --> 03:24:50,370
There's like, left click?

3558
03:24:50,370 --> 03:24:51,310
Okay.

3559
03:24:51,950 --> 03:24:54,110
Okay, this has to be stronger though.

3560
03:24:56,090 --> 03:24:57,970
Yeah, it's a stronger move.

3561
03:25:00,650 --> 03:25:01,790
Oh my god.

3562
03:25:02,390 --> 03:25:03,570
This fucking angle.

3563
03:25:04,130 --> 03:25:05,530
Where are my peripheral vision?

3564
03:25:05,950 --> 03:25:07,350
My peripherals.

3565
03:25:10,190 --> 03:25:11,450
Oh my god.

3566
03:25:11,750 --> 03:25:12,130
Please.

3567
03:25:13,490 --> 03:25:15,890
I don't have depth perception right now.

3568
03:25:20,370 --> 03:25:21,630
The Dutch angle.

3569
03:25:22,250 --> 03:25:24,990
I don't have depth perception.

3570
03:25:25,210 --> 03:25:28,270
I couldn't grab anything because of the Dutch angle.

3571
03:25:31,130 --> 03:25:31,690
Okay.

3572
03:25:32,230 --> 03:25:32,850
Here we go.

3573
03:25:34,250 --> 03:25:35,830
I still don't know what the potion does.

3574
03:25:35,930 --> 03:25:37,670
Other than...

3575
03:25:37,670 --> 03:25:38,990
Is there anything I can kick here?

3576
03:25:40,350 --> 03:25:41,450
Oh, there is.

3577
03:25:41,550 --> 03:25:41,930
Nice.

3578
03:25:43,450 --> 03:25:44,070
Okay.

3579
03:25:44,270 --> 03:25:45,190
I want more money.

3580
03:25:46,550 --> 03:25:47,230
Money.

3581
03:25:47,230 --> 03:25:47,530
Money.

3582
03:25:49,790 --> 03:25:51,490
Okay, there you go.

3583
03:25:52,130 --> 03:25:54,650
Now I'm gonna be jacked up now.

3584
03:25:55,810 --> 03:25:57,610
And then we kick this one.

3585
03:25:59,010 --> 03:25:59,950
That's right, Eeyore.

3586
03:26:00,690 --> 03:26:02,670
I know where your stash is.

3587
03:26:03,870 --> 03:26:04,850
I'm gonna try it.

3588
03:26:05,090 --> 03:26:05,710
That's right.

3589
03:26:05,870 --> 03:26:07,490
I know where it is, Eeyore.

3590
03:26:08,530 --> 03:26:09,890
I try to hide the goods.

3591
03:26:11,070 --> 03:26:12,130
That's fucking right.

3592
03:26:12,970 --> 03:26:14,690
You don't hide the goods from me.

3593
03:26:15,230 --> 03:26:16,750
I need to get my fix.

3594
03:26:18,630 --> 03:26:19,030
Alright.

3595
03:26:19,950 --> 03:26:21,470
Let's go this way.

3596
03:26:22,590 --> 03:26:24,010
Oh, is there like cookies here?

3597
03:26:24,590 --> 03:26:25,290
Should be.

3598
03:26:25,450 --> 03:26:25,850
Nice.

3599
03:26:27,030 --> 03:26:30,550
I just want to make sure I have enough for like another move soon.

3600
03:26:31,350 --> 03:26:32,770
Expert, thank you for the super chat.

3601
03:26:32,850 --> 03:26:33,790
Thank you, thank you.

3602
03:26:35,370 --> 03:26:37,030
Also, Derp, thank you for the super chat.

3603
03:26:37,130 --> 03:26:37,750
Thank you, thank you.

3604
03:26:37,770 --> 03:26:39,070
You're such a good friend of Eeyore.

3605
03:26:39,230 --> 03:26:40,790
Sealing all his stuff and...

3606
03:26:41,630 --> 03:26:42,030
Borrowing?

3607
03:26:42,030 --> 03:26:42,110
Borrowing?

3608
03:26:44,170 --> 03:26:47,650
I was just borrowing his stuff.

3609
03:26:47,970 --> 03:26:49,630
I will clearly return it.

3610
03:26:50,990 --> 03:26:53,710
You know, in like 5 to 10 years.

3611
03:26:56,680 --> 03:26:57,640
Alright, Rue.

3612
03:26:57,760 --> 03:26:58,680
We need your lamp.

3613
03:26:59,780 --> 03:27:00,760
We need this.

3614
03:27:01,400 --> 03:27:01,980
Hand it over.

3615
03:27:06,180 --> 03:27:06,860
See?

3616
03:27:08,020 --> 03:27:08,700
Borrowing.

3617
03:27:13,400 --> 03:27:14,380
You know what?

3618
03:27:14,880 --> 03:27:18,260
I'm gonna undream himself now.

3619
03:27:21,340 --> 03:27:22,640
You know what?

3620
03:27:22,880 --> 03:27:24,740
I'm just gonna undream myself.

3621
03:27:25,140 --> 03:27:27,720
I'm just gonna leave.

3622
03:27:29,760 --> 03:27:30,760
He's out.

3623
03:27:31,320 --> 03:27:33,060
He's not even real in his dream.

3624
03:27:33,160 --> 03:27:35,580
And even Dream Rue was like, I'm leaving.

3625
03:27:37,020 --> 03:27:38,280
They can get out of here.

3626
03:27:39,820 --> 03:27:40,500
Yeah.

3627
03:27:41,120 --> 03:27:42,520
I can't be bothered.

3628
03:27:43,160 --> 03:27:48,140
Because like, there's no point in fighting them, cause like, I don't get anything out of it.

3629
03:27:51,620 --> 03:27:54,900
No, the saddest part is the fact that he's not even real.

3630
03:27:55,600 --> 03:27:57,080
He's Dream Rue.

3631
03:27:57,280 --> 03:28:00,360
And even Dream Rue was like, fuck this shit.

3632
03:28:03,940 --> 03:28:07,340
Dream Rue is like, undream me now, Eeyore.

3633
03:28:08,300 --> 03:28:09,980
What the fuck do I do with potions?

3634
03:28:09,980 --> 03:28:12,160
Okay, I got the...

3635
03:28:12,160 --> 03:28:12,260
Okay.

3636
03:28:16,410 --> 03:28:16,890
Alright.

3637
03:28:17,290 --> 03:28:17,630
Light.

3638
03:28:18,890 --> 03:28:21,410
Alright, and then we gotta light this one too.

3639
03:28:21,470 --> 03:28:22,750
Oh wait, it was just one?

3640
03:28:24,690 --> 03:28:26,410
Did you get Rue's lamp?

3641
03:28:26,810 --> 03:28:27,110
Yeah.

3642
03:28:27,210 --> 03:28:28,930
It's still dark in here.

3643
03:28:29,450 --> 03:28:29,590
What?

3644
03:28:31,550 --> 03:28:33,490
Oh my god, you're so demanding.

3645
03:28:34,690 --> 03:28:36,090
You're so demanding.

3646
03:28:43,810 --> 03:28:46,030
I already did it on the mission, so it doesn't really matter.

3647
03:28:46,190 --> 03:28:46,870
Doors are open?

3648
03:28:51,950 --> 03:28:52,910
Oh, what's that?

3649
03:28:53,350 --> 03:28:54,170
The door!

3650
03:29:08,370 --> 03:29:09,590
Wait, he didn't die!

3651
03:29:09,590 --> 03:29:10,930
Guys, see, it wasn't murder.

3652
03:29:11,530 --> 03:29:13,830
Guys, I told you it wasn't murder.

3653
03:29:14,350 --> 03:29:15,690
He's still alive.

3654
03:29:17,730 --> 03:29:18,930
Wait, what?

3655
03:29:22,610 --> 03:29:23,290
What?

3656
03:29:26,650 --> 03:29:28,130
But I'm broke.

3657
03:29:30,960 --> 03:29:32,700
The fuck is all these?

3658
03:29:34,700 --> 03:29:36,360
What's the top left?

3659
03:29:36,520 --> 03:29:36,660
What?

3660
03:29:36,660 --> 03:29:37,180
What?

3661
03:29:38,500 --> 03:29:40,660
What the fuck is the top left?

3662
03:29:40,780 --> 03:29:41,660
I don't have money!

3663
03:29:44,420 --> 03:29:46,720
Oh my god, what can I kick?

3664
03:29:47,640 --> 03:29:48,820
What can I kick?

3665
03:29:48,880 --> 03:29:50,160
I don't have money!

3666
03:29:51,560 --> 03:29:53,580
I need a fuck...

3667
03:29:53,580 --> 03:29:54,120
No!

3668
03:29:55,400 --> 03:29:57,180
What do I kick?

3669
03:30:00,420 --> 03:30:00,740
No!

3670
03:30:01,980 --> 03:30:02,620
No!

3671
03:30:04,840 --> 03:30:06,300
I didn't get...

3672
03:30:06,300 --> 03:30:07,820
Okay, sorry Eeyore.

3673
03:30:08,500 --> 03:30:10,620
I'm actually gonna leave your dream now.

3674
03:30:11,020 --> 03:30:12,460
I'm gonna...

3675
03:30:13,540 --> 03:30:14,860
Sorry, Eeyore.

3676
03:30:16,440 --> 03:30:17,880
You're actually on your...

3677
03:30:17,880 --> 03:30:19,400
I'm gonna leave your dream.

3678
03:30:20,920 --> 03:30:22,540
I'll come back later.

3679
03:30:26,940 --> 03:30:27,660
Goodbye.

3680
03:30:28,680 --> 03:30:30,620
I gotta go to...

3681
03:30:30,620 --> 03:30:32,000
Owl's dream now.

3682
03:30:38,580 --> 03:30:40,300
Alright, let's go to Owl's dream.

3683
03:30:40,400 --> 03:30:42,260
I farmed a lot of cookies, though.

3684
03:30:42,280 --> 03:30:43,080
That's the thing.

3685
03:30:43,520 --> 03:30:45,560
I don't think there's a lot of cookies left to farm.

3686
03:30:46,900 --> 03:30:49,440
I feel like I have to go to...

3687
03:30:49,440 --> 03:30:51,560
Like, I sell that one cookie here.

3688
03:30:52,260 --> 03:30:53,140
And then...

3689
03:30:53,140 --> 03:30:54,380
No, no, no, no, no!

3690
03:30:54,460 --> 03:30:55,280
No, no, no!

3691
03:30:55,780 --> 03:30:56,220
Yeah,

3692
03:30:59,260 --> 03:31:01,080
but he's like ruining the mood.

3693
03:31:01,400 --> 03:31:02,440
You know, that's different.

3694
03:31:03,680 --> 03:31:04,560
He's like...

3695
03:31:04,560 --> 03:31:07,360
I'm trying to fix Eeyore's depression right now.

3696
03:31:07,440 --> 03:31:08,020
And like...

3697
03:31:08,270 --> 03:31:10,260
The door's ruining the vibes.

3698
03:31:10,420 --> 03:31:12,560
He's like killing the vibes right now.

3699
03:31:14,720 --> 03:31:16,100
Gotta get out.

3700
03:31:17,860 --> 03:31:18,800
It's fine.

3701
03:31:18,900 --> 03:31:19,500
It's the same.

3702
03:31:19,780 --> 03:31:20,580
It's still dark.

3703
03:31:22,880 --> 03:31:23,500
Okay.

3704
03:31:25,280 --> 03:31:26,600
I mean, you're welcome to fix him.

3705
03:31:27,340 --> 03:31:28,960
I feel like everybody's tried.

3706
03:31:30,640 --> 03:31:31,060
Look.

3707
03:31:31,060 --> 03:31:33,760
He's gotta be able to fix himself.

3708
03:31:33,920 --> 03:31:34,280
Okay?

3709
03:31:34,660 --> 03:31:37,800
The thing is, he doesn't want to be fixed.

3710
03:31:37,880 --> 03:31:39,800
And that's why it's a problem.

3711
03:31:41,240 --> 03:31:42,240
That's the thing.

3712
03:31:43,200 --> 03:31:45,340
Alright, we gotta go to...

3713
03:31:45,340 --> 03:31:46,920
Go to eat the door.

3714
03:31:47,680 --> 03:31:49,060
Get the fire from...

3715
03:31:49,740 --> 03:31:50,620
Rue's dream.

3716
03:31:51,420 --> 03:31:52,280
What is Alistar's dream?

3717
03:31:52,380 --> 03:31:53,400
I don't remember Alistar's dream.

3718
03:31:53,480 --> 03:31:57,200
I just remember never...

3719
03:31:57,200 --> 03:31:59,060
I just remember never...

3720
03:32:05,350 --> 03:32:05,970
What?

3721
03:32:06,170 --> 03:32:06,930
Not here?

3722
03:32:07,770 --> 03:32:09,930
I remember I could never finish Alistar's dream.

3723
03:32:15,720 --> 03:32:16,620
What is he trying to find?

3724
03:32:16,720 --> 03:32:17,320
His book?

3725
03:32:28,340 --> 03:32:29,260
Hey, Gopher!

3726
03:32:33,300 --> 03:32:34,920
What are you doing here?

3727
03:32:49,680 --> 03:32:51,080
Huh?

3728
03:33:06,680 --> 03:33:09,480
With what?

3729
03:33:16,980 --> 03:33:17,580
With what?

3730
03:33:17,940 --> 03:33:21,660
I feel like he never had this tick.

3731
03:33:22,540 --> 03:33:23,460
Like, frequently.

3732
03:33:23,660 --> 03:33:25,120
This is like way too much whistling.

3733
03:33:29,540 --> 03:33:32,260
I feel like this one's like way too many whistles.

3734
03:33:34,260 --> 03:33:36,620
Did he actually whistle every...

3735
03:33:36,620 --> 03:33:38,080
Every like...

3736
03:33:38,080 --> 03:33:39,120
Sentence?

3737
03:33:39,340 --> 03:33:41,100
I don't remember if he did.

3738
03:33:42,720 --> 03:33:43,520
Did he actually?

3739
03:33:43,520 --> 03:33:46,200
I don't remember it being this often.

3740
03:33:46,880 --> 03:33:49,840
I knew he whistled, but that was like...

3741
03:33:49,840 --> 03:33:50,220
A lot.

3742
03:33:51,540 --> 03:33:52,620
Oh, I should kick.

3743
03:33:53,300 --> 03:33:53,640
Kick!

3744
03:33:54,860 --> 03:33:57,820
This is the worst part of farming for cookies.

3745
03:33:58,600 --> 03:34:01,000
This is the worst part.

3746
03:34:02,580 --> 03:34:05,800
I think it just sucks it's so many cookies.

3747
03:34:09,420 --> 03:34:10,980
Like the power-ups.

3748
03:34:10,980 --> 03:34:12,640
You have to like...

3749
03:34:12,640 --> 03:34:14,300
Actually be actively farming them.

3750
03:34:16,380 --> 03:34:17,700
It's like a cookie simulator.

3751
03:34:19,240 --> 03:34:19,680
No!

3752
03:34:20,040 --> 03:34:21,940
No, it's behind a thing!

3753
03:34:25,380 --> 03:34:26,800
Did I farm this one yet?

3754
03:34:26,840 --> 03:34:27,380
No, I didn't.

3755
03:34:27,580 --> 03:34:28,660
Okay, I gotta make sure.

3756
03:34:29,320 --> 03:34:31,060
Because the next one is at like a hundred.

3757
03:34:31,340 --> 03:34:32,300
So I gotta make sure.

3758
03:34:33,220 --> 03:34:34,820
Alright, off I go.

3759
03:34:35,060 --> 03:34:35,980
Owl, wake up!

3760
03:34:35,980 --> 03:34:36,700
Owl!

3761
03:34:38,080 --> 03:34:38,680
Owl!

3762
03:34:48,170 --> 03:34:49,630
Oh, I'm so strong.

3763
03:34:50,210 --> 03:34:51,650
I'll pick that, you're so strong.

3764
03:34:54,430 --> 03:34:55,330
Wait, what?

3765
03:34:56,850 --> 03:34:57,970
Did I not push it?

3766
03:35:00,110 --> 03:35:01,390
What's going on?

3767
03:35:02,770 --> 03:35:04,310
The fuck does that mean?

3768
03:35:04,590 --> 03:35:05,030
What?

3769
03:35:06,550 --> 03:35:08,270
I don't know what that means!

3770
03:35:08,390 --> 03:35:08,830
I...

3771
03:35:12,650 --> 03:35:15,790
What does that even mean?

3772
03:35:18,410 --> 03:35:20,070
Give me my cookies.

3773
03:35:20,430 --> 03:35:21,410
Now I'm mad.

3774
03:35:23,890 --> 03:35:26,680
Oh, it's like in order.

3775
03:35:27,870 --> 03:35:29,450
Oh, I see.

3776
03:35:33,310 --> 03:35:34,290
Okay.

3777
03:35:34,870 --> 03:35:36,270
Okay, yellow.

3778
03:35:37,450 --> 03:35:39,330
Okay, yellow first.

3779
03:35:40,950 --> 03:35:42,630
That should work, right?

3780
03:35:42,630 --> 03:35:43,050
Okay.

3781
03:35:43,530 --> 03:35:45,110
No, that's not yellow, that's green.

3782
03:35:46,310 --> 03:35:47,430
Wait, red?

3783
03:35:53,280 --> 03:35:54,840
Oh, it's red.

3784
03:35:56,300 --> 03:35:57,980
Okay, it's red.

3785
03:35:58,120 --> 03:35:59,740
Oh wait, this is trial and error.

3786
03:36:00,700 --> 03:36:01,420
Red, yellow?

3787
03:36:07,290 --> 03:36:08,870
Oh, it's just backwards.

3788
03:36:09,830 --> 03:36:11,870
Okay, that's easy.

3789
03:36:12,470 --> 03:36:13,650
Look at that, I'm so smart.

3790
03:36:17,940 --> 03:36:18,620
Yay!

3791
03:36:20,380 --> 03:36:22,120
It was literally just like...

3792
03:36:22,120 --> 03:36:22,560
backwards.

3793
03:36:26,900 --> 03:36:29,280
Wait, it's locked.

3794
03:36:30,560 --> 03:36:31,960
Wait, what the fuck?

3795
03:36:38,120 --> 03:36:41,960
Why is he in a cage?

3796
03:36:43,300 --> 03:36:45,060
What did Owl want to do to him?

3797
03:36:53,320 --> 03:36:54,720
Wow.

3798
03:36:55,820 --> 03:36:56,480
That's a cage.

3799
03:37:08,980 --> 03:37:10,380
Oh.

3800
03:37:19,660 --> 03:37:21,180
Wait, I want to play pool.

3801
03:37:24,560 --> 03:37:25,760
I want to be pool bear.

3802
03:37:27,120 --> 03:37:28,260
Oh my god, look at him go.

3803
03:37:33,160 --> 03:37:34,580
I'm gonna get you.

3804
03:37:38,340 --> 03:37:40,220
I wonder if I can be sneaky.

3805
03:37:41,880 --> 03:37:43,520
Oh my god, no, I'm too hungry.

3806
03:37:44,180 --> 03:37:45,380
No, I'm too hungry.

3807
03:37:49,060 --> 03:37:51,380
Bro, what the fuck?

3808
03:37:51,820 --> 03:37:53,500
Wait, I'm so fucked up.

3809
03:37:53,560 --> 03:37:54,520
I'm too hungry.

3810
03:37:55,120 --> 03:37:57,020
I'm so fucked up.

3811
03:38:01,040 --> 03:38:03,060
Oh my god.

3812
03:38:03,420 --> 03:38:05,000
I'm so messed up.

3813
03:38:09,080 --> 03:38:10,520
Jesus Christ.

3814
03:38:11,080 --> 03:38:12,240
I got to the other side.

3815
03:38:12,740 --> 03:38:14,860
I got to the other side.

3816
03:38:14,860 --> 03:38:16,260
You're wrong.

3817
03:38:16,560 --> 03:38:16,960
You're right.

3818
03:38:21,820 --> 03:38:23,260
Okay, so...

3819
03:38:23,740 --> 03:38:25,700
Pool bear!

3820
03:38:28,180 --> 03:38:29,180
Not again!

3821
03:38:30,260 --> 03:38:31,580
Where do I go?

3822
03:38:32,460 --> 03:38:34,100
That's a maze.

3823
03:38:35,560 --> 03:38:37,760
Oh, I'm fucked.

3824
03:38:38,060 --> 03:38:38,680
Oh no.

3825
03:38:39,120 --> 03:38:39,520
No!

3826
03:38:44,860 --> 03:38:46,000
No, I'm scared.

3827
03:38:46,860 --> 03:38:47,740
I'm scared.

3828
03:38:48,460 --> 03:38:50,400
No, am I gonna have to do it from the beginning?

3829
03:38:56,460 --> 03:38:58,680
I got cornered.

3830
03:38:59,100 --> 03:39:00,880
How the fuck do I get out?

3831
03:39:19,810 --> 03:39:23,490
Oh my god.

3832
03:39:26,870 --> 03:39:29,360
That really doesn't like...

3833
03:39:31,210 --> 03:39:32,990
Oh, you don't, Piglet.

3834
03:39:33,330 --> 03:39:35,210
You don't have to.

3835
03:39:36,050 --> 03:39:39,010
Oh, so this is why you never finished it.

3836
03:39:39,410 --> 03:39:40,270
No, thank you.

3837
03:39:40,370 --> 03:39:42,190
Thank you.

3838
03:39:42,830 --> 03:39:44,890
This is not fair!

3839
03:39:47,590 --> 03:39:49,590
This is actually...

3840
03:39:52,210 --> 03:39:54,370
Oh my god.

3841
03:39:54,850 --> 03:39:56,330
Okay, we go this way.

3842
03:39:56,710 --> 03:39:57,730
We go this way.

3843
03:39:58,290 --> 03:40:00,170
Run, Pool Bear, run!

3844
03:40:01,290 --> 03:40:02,030
Run!

3845
03:40:03,430 --> 03:40:03,830
Run!

3846
03:40:05,750 --> 03:40:07,150
Oh my god.

3847
03:40:07,870 --> 03:40:09,030
See, we made it.

3848
03:40:10,130 --> 03:40:13,570
We made it a lot faster, Pooh.

3849
03:40:15,910 --> 03:40:17,370
Oh my god.

3850
03:40:17,670 --> 03:40:19,170
We hope you'll run faster.

3851
03:40:19,310 --> 03:40:20,070
We do it enough.

3852
03:40:20,390 --> 03:40:22,330
The worst part is this area.

3853
03:40:22,470 --> 03:40:23,890
This area is the worst part.

3854
03:40:24,430 --> 03:40:28,070
Because it's like, you can get cornered so easily because you don't know...

3855
03:40:28,070 --> 03:40:29,710
Like, what is this bullshit?

3856
03:40:33,070 --> 03:40:34,650
Are you serious?

3857
03:40:38,490 --> 03:40:40,510
That's actually bullshit!

3858
03:40:40,510 --> 03:40:40,610
That's bullshit!

3859
03:40:42,510 --> 03:40:44,430
Like, where do I go?

3860
03:40:48,420 --> 03:40:48,840
Turn!

3861
03:40:56,420 --> 03:40:58,440
No, I have to do this again.

3862
03:40:58,860 --> 03:40:59,660
Keep running.

3863
03:41:00,160 --> 03:41:03,520
Thank you for the super chat.

3864
03:41:04,060 --> 03:41:06,260
Bro, this is so bullshit!

3865
03:41:07,560 --> 03:41:07,880
Okay.

3866
03:41:08,360 --> 03:41:10,400
Oh my god, here I go again.

3867
03:41:10,660 --> 03:41:11,080
Stop!

3868
03:41:11,520 --> 03:41:12,860
Get away from me!

3869
03:41:13,280 --> 03:41:14,300
Oh, body.

3870
03:41:16,140 --> 03:41:17,340
Oh, body.

3871
03:41:19,480 --> 03:41:20,840
Oh my god.

3872
03:41:20,960 --> 03:41:21,840
Where do I go?

3873
03:41:22,100 --> 03:41:24,220
Where do I go?

3874
03:41:24,440 --> 03:41:26,980
They all want a piece of me!

3875
03:41:27,080 --> 03:41:29,100
Waddle away, waddle waddle.

3876
03:41:29,640 --> 03:41:31,730
Waddle away, waddle waddle.

3877
03:41:35,600 --> 03:41:37,520
Why did they make this part so hard?

3878
03:41:43,470 --> 03:41:45,110
Why did they...

3879
03:41:45,110 --> 03:41:49,470
Why specifically this part?!

3880
03:41:49,470 --> 03:41:52,110
Oh my god!

3881
03:41:52,110 --> 03:41:54,270
Where do I waddle?

3882
03:41:54,610 --> 03:41:55,630
And waddle waddle.

3883
03:41:56,090 --> 03:41:57,310
And he waddled away.

3884
03:41:57,570 --> 03:41:58,470
Waddle waddle.

3885
03:41:58,890 --> 03:42:00,370
And he waddled away.

3886
03:42:00,770 --> 03:42:02,090
Waddle waddle.

3887
03:42:02,570 --> 03:42:04,470
And he waddled away.

3888
03:42:05,270 --> 03:42:07,370
Get waddling, Pooh Bear!

3889
03:42:08,230 --> 03:42:09,750
Get waddling!

3890
03:42:12,770 --> 03:42:14,030
Oh my god!

3891
03:42:14,610 --> 03:42:15,530
We did it!

3892
03:42:16,010 --> 03:42:17,350
We made it!

3893
03:42:17,750 --> 03:42:19,790
And then he got caught after.

3894
03:42:21,470 --> 03:42:22,130
He...

3895
03:42:22,130 --> 03:42:23,590
He actually...

3896
03:42:23,590 --> 03:42:25,590
Bro, fuck that level!

3897
03:42:31,180 --> 03:42:32,900
Oh, he's alive!

3898
03:42:45,150 --> 03:42:47,080
Oh yeah, no, there's a lot.

3899
03:42:47,300 --> 03:42:48,180
Good luck, Piglet.

3900
03:42:54,180 --> 03:42:55,920
He almost died, Piglet.

3901
03:42:55,980 --> 03:42:57,120
He did it for you!

3902
03:42:57,380 --> 03:42:59,080
He did it all for you!

3903
03:43:00,920 --> 03:43:03,560
He live hungry and traumatized.

3904
03:43:03,720 --> 03:43:05,340
Now he's gonna eat his feelings away.

3905
03:43:07,780 --> 03:43:08,420
Alright.

3906
03:43:09,320 --> 03:43:12,180
Okay, now I don't have to fucking worry anymore.

3907
03:43:12,760 --> 03:43:14,420
Now it's not that bad.

3908
03:43:15,880 --> 03:43:18,820
I can actually fight back.

3909
03:43:23,760 --> 03:43:25,300
Alright, finally.

3910
03:43:26,620 --> 03:43:28,280
That's right, Huffalumps!

3911
03:43:28,640 --> 03:43:30,560
I can fight back!

3912
03:43:31,140 --> 03:43:31,860
Be gone!

3913
03:43:33,760 --> 03:43:35,320
Be gone!

3914
03:43:39,520 --> 03:43:40,300
Key?

3915
03:43:42,380 --> 03:43:43,900
Where would the key be?

3916
03:43:47,450 --> 03:43:50,410
I'm just gonna try and see if I can find a key here.

3917
03:43:50,410 --> 03:43:51,330
Oh.

3918
03:43:53,680 --> 03:43:54,500
That's fine.

3919
03:43:55,740 --> 03:43:59,580
These guys don't have as much HP as the other levels, so like, I'm not too worried.

3920
03:44:00,840 --> 03:44:01,340
Alright.

3921
03:44:01,560 --> 03:44:02,600
Pull those ears.

3922
03:44:03,320 --> 03:44:04,840
They like, die faster.

3923
03:44:05,640 --> 03:44:06,180
Okay.

3924
03:44:06,640 --> 03:44:06,940
Um.

3925
03:44:07,940 --> 03:44:08,600
Okay.

3926
03:44:09,140 --> 03:44:11,000
I should've gave a little bit more space.

3927
03:44:11,660 --> 03:44:12,040
Okay.

3928
03:44:12,280 --> 03:44:12,740
Okay!

3929
03:44:14,460 --> 03:44:15,120
Nevermind.

3930
03:44:17,720 --> 03:44:18,380
Nevermind.

3931
03:44:19,980 --> 03:44:20,560
Nevermind.

3932
03:44:21,620 --> 03:44:22,080
Nevermind.

3933
03:44:22,080 --> 03:44:23,020
Guess it wasn't.

3934
03:44:24,440 --> 03:44:26,660
Wait, is there like, any cookies here though?

3935
03:44:27,040 --> 03:44:28,720
I don't know if there's any cookies here.

3936
03:44:31,660 --> 03:44:32,240
Look!

3937
03:44:32,300 --> 03:44:33,600
He was so fast!

3938
03:44:34,560 --> 03:44:35,960
I couldn't juke him!

3939
03:44:37,120 --> 03:44:38,740
It was so fast!

3940
03:44:39,100 --> 03:44:40,360
I was just a little guy.

3941
03:44:42,260 --> 03:44:43,620
Oh no, I'm scared.

3942
03:44:46,600 --> 03:44:49,580
Okay, so there should be...

3943
03:44:51,560 --> 03:44:53,760
Okay, there should be a key somewhere here.

3944
03:44:54,560 --> 03:44:54,840
Alright.

3945
03:44:55,140 --> 03:44:56,920
This should be enough space, right?

3946
03:44:57,820 --> 03:44:58,220
Yeah!

3947
03:44:58,380 --> 03:45:01,660
There should be enough space as long as he doesn't close his eyes.

3948
03:45:01,760 --> 03:45:02,520
We should be fine.

3949
03:45:05,740 --> 03:45:06,880
Don't close your eyes!

3950
03:45:06,940 --> 03:45:07,520
That's illegal.

3951
03:45:09,620 --> 03:45:10,020
Nice.

3952
03:45:10,160 --> 03:45:10,920
Okay, we did it.

3953
03:45:12,500 --> 03:45:16,400
Oh, by the way, I forgot to... I think like, I was in middle of top... Oh, wait.

3954
03:45:17,100 --> 03:45:17,580
Oh!

3955
03:45:18,020 --> 03:45:19,500
I just got killed though.

3956
03:45:20,720 --> 03:45:21,620
Oh my god.

3957
03:45:22,480 --> 03:45:23,620
Okay, I had to kill the other guy.

3958
03:45:24,340 --> 03:45:24,560
Okay.

3959
03:45:24,980 --> 03:45:26,660
But yeah, yesterday I watched Wicked.

3960
03:45:28,340 --> 03:45:28,820
Um...

3961
03:45:28,820 --> 03:45:30,840
I think watching in 3D was a mistake.

3962
03:45:32,940 --> 03:45:37,320
I haven't watched a movie in like, years.

3963
03:45:37,580 --> 03:45:38,380
Like, at a theater.

3964
03:45:39,260 --> 03:45:42,580
I haven't watched a movie in a theater in a long, long time.

3965
03:45:43,200 --> 03:45:49,540
And like, the thing is, normal standard doesn't have like... Why 3D?

3966
03:45:49,720 --> 03:45:55,580
Because like, I wanted like, um, IMAX and like, it's 3D.

3967
03:45:55,820 --> 03:45:56,540
So...

3968
03:45:58,260 --> 03:45:58,980
So...

3969
03:45:59,780 --> 03:46:01,480
Yeah, so like...

3970
03:46:01,480 --> 03:46:10,620
Yeah, and then like, the colors were so... I realized that the colors were so like, washed out because of the 3D glasses.

3971
03:46:10,700 --> 03:46:13,220
Because I haven't watched a 3D movie in a long time.

3972
03:46:18,860 --> 03:46:19,540
What the fuck?

3973
03:46:19,700 --> 03:46:20,340
What are you doing here?

3974
03:46:26,640 --> 03:46:32,340
Wait, how did you get here with digging?

3975
03:46:34,420 --> 03:46:35,400
We're hovering!

3976
03:46:42,080 --> 03:46:42,820
Yeah.

3977
03:46:46,100 --> 03:46:48,480
Yeah, they're like, washed out.

3978
03:46:49,240 --> 03:46:49,920
What?

3979
03:46:54,220 --> 03:46:55,700
I know!

3980
03:47:04,100 --> 03:47:06,780
Wait, children and chess?

3981
03:47:07,240 --> 03:47:07,680
Yes!

3982
03:47:10,080 --> 03:47:10,520
Yep.

3983
03:47:13,200 --> 03:47:13,640
Oh.

3984
03:47:14,160 --> 03:47:14,600
Okay.

3985
03:47:14,980 --> 03:47:15,340
Here.

3986
03:47:17,700 --> 03:47:18,700
Let's do this.

3987
03:47:20,140 --> 03:47:21,740
Wait, is this...

3988
03:47:23,180 --> 03:47:25,160
That's the bishop right here.

3989
03:47:25,860 --> 03:47:27,120
I guess that's the pawn, right?

3990
03:47:27,220 --> 03:47:28,660
This is the pawn, so this is the castle.

3991
03:47:28,840 --> 03:47:29,060
Okay.

3992
03:47:29,640 --> 03:47:32,680
I feel like I was just teaching children, like...

3993
03:47:32,680 --> 03:47:33,340
There you go.

3994
03:47:35,360 --> 03:47:35,820
Yay!

3995
03:47:36,400 --> 03:47:37,440
We did it!

3996
03:47:38,600 --> 03:47:41,940
Yeah, but like, how the fuck are the kids... Some kids don't play chess?

3997
03:47:45,040 --> 03:47:45,500
Like...

3998
03:47:45,500 --> 03:47:46,740
Some kids don't play chess.

3999
03:47:46,820 --> 03:47:48,140
How the fuck do they know?

4000
03:47:49,440 --> 03:47:49,900
Yeah!

4001
03:47:52,200 --> 03:47:53,520
What is he gonna say to me?

4002
03:47:59,280 --> 03:48:01,520
Yeah, he doesn't... No, I played like...

4003
03:48:01,520 --> 03:48:03,240
I learned chess in middle school.

4004
03:48:03,980 --> 03:48:04,500
God.

4005
03:48:04,860 --> 03:48:09,280
This game is not tied towards... Wait, what about the key?

4006
03:48:10,320 --> 03:48:11,900
There's no key here.

4007
03:48:12,900 --> 03:48:14,320
What about the key?

4008
03:48:16,180 --> 03:48:17,920
I thought I was supposed to get a key.

4009
03:48:25,800 --> 03:48:26,100
What?

4010
03:48:27,180 --> 03:48:30,560
Yeah, but like, a lot of children don't learn chess at the...

4011
03:48:30,560 --> 03:48:32,800
No, no, there was like, um...

4012
03:48:32,800 --> 03:48:34,220
The thing in the center.

4013
03:48:34,220 --> 03:48:39,100
They're like, when you grab a key, then you can open this.

4014
03:48:40,960 --> 03:48:42,920
Middle schoolers are tweens.

4015
03:48:43,420 --> 03:48:45,760
I was a tween in middle school.

4016
03:48:46,260 --> 03:48:47,120
Get it right.

4017
03:48:48,860 --> 03:48:49,480
This!

4018
03:48:51,580 --> 03:48:54,220
Okay, I must have to like...

4019
03:48:54,760 --> 03:48:55,760
What's the word?

4020
03:48:56,120 --> 03:48:57,140
Travel back to it.

4021
03:49:01,890 --> 03:49:03,970
I was in a chess club in elementary school.

4022
03:49:03,970 --> 03:49:05,130
Nerd!

4023
03:49:06,790 --> 03:49:07,750
That's right.

4024
03:49:09,650 --> 03:49:11,270
That's where I said it.

4025
03:49:13,750 --> 03:49:14,830
That's right.

4026
03:49:16,630 --> 03:49:17,870
Yeah, okay, nerd.

4027
03:49:22,730 --> 03:49:25,930
You know what I played as a child?

4028
03:49:26,710 --> 03:49:28,330
I played Chinese chess.

4029
03:49:28,570 --> 03:49:31,530
The one with like, the tiger...

4030
03:49:32,590 --> 03:49:33,110
The...

4031
03:49:33,110 --> 03:49:34,830
I just remembered the tiger piece.

4032
03:49:35,030 --> 03:49:39,370
I played Chinese chess as a child.

4033
03:49:40,010 --> 03:49:43,070
Which apparently is harder than regular chess because it's like...

4034
03:49:43,070 --> 03:49:44,910
There's just so many rules to it.

4035
03:49:46,310 --> 03:49:47,810
Oh, he's scared.

4036
03:49:48,190 --> 03:49:49,170
That's right.

4037
03:49:54,750 --> 03:49:55,850
Yeah, I remembered.

4038
03:49:55,950 --> 03:49:58,110
I used to play that a lot as a kid.

4039
03:49:59,230 --> 03:50:01,930
And I also played the star marble game too.

4040
03:50:02,070 --> 03:50:02,950
Oh, that's cute!

4041
03:50:03,070 --> 03:50:04,430
That's like a Mickey Mouse ink.

4042
03:50:08,510 --> 03:50:09,190
Nerd!

4043
03:50:10,930 --> 03:50:12,810
No, he closed his eyes!

4044
03:50:24,650 --> 03:50:27,010
The one with the star shape.

4045
03:50:28,430 --> 03:50:30,930
I don't remember what it was called.

4046
03:50:34,890 --> 03:50:39,550
Oh, it's a treasure map.

4047
03:50:40,350 --> 03:50:40,770
What?

4048
03:50:44,950 --> 03:50:46,790
What the fuck do I do here?

4049
03:50:49,530 --> 03:50:50,750
That one was fun.

4050
03:50:50,830 --> 03:50:51,650
I love playing that.

4051
03:50:51,690 --> 03:50:53,370
I love playing that in Chinese chess.

4052
03:50:53,830 --> 03:50:55,330
It was like one of my favorite board games.

4053
03:50:56,070 --> 03:51:00,910
I remember like, in a before times I was like, does anyone play any of these?

4054
03:51:01,350 --> 03:51:05,030
Because I want to do a collab stream of it and no one knew how to play.

4055
03:51:10,090 --> 03:51:14,010
It's like, I found a website where you can play online.

4056
03:51:17,530 --> 03:51:20,610
I was like, everyone, I really want to stream this game.

4057
03:51:20,770 --> 03:51:22,110
Does anyone know how to play?

4058
03:51:22,590 --> 03:51:24,050
Because I didn't want to play it.

4059
03:51:24,470 --> 03:51:25,570
No one knew how.

4060
03:51:25,570 --> 03:51:25,650
Oh.

4061
03:51:30,650 --> 03:51:32,050
What?

4062
03:51:39,170 --> 03:51:40,250
What?

4063
03:51:56,370 --> 03:51:59,610
Did he call me Kinglet?

4064
03:52:02,970 --> 03:52:04,710
I'm literally a pig.

4065
03:52:06,690 --> 03:52:08,410
A memory book?

4066
03:52:09,530 --> 03:52:10,410
Oh my god.

4067
03:52:11,030 --> 03:52:12,470
He has amnesia.

4068
03:52:14,690 --> 03:52:15,650
Oh my god.

4069
03:52:16,970 --> 03:52:18,910
His biggest fear is dementia?

4070
03:52:20,330 --> 03:52:23,830
And then Rue's biggest fear is losing his fucking balls?

4071
03:52:26,150 --> 03:52:29,470
Like, understand, Winnie's biggest... Winnie the Pooh I like Winnie's.

4072
03:52:30,450 --> 03:52:32,070
Yeah, he's my...

4073
03:52:32,070 --> 03:52:34,470
Homies call him by his first name.

4074
03:52:38,430 --> 03:52:39,590
Oh my god.

4075
03:52:39,670 --> 03:52:42,790
I like how that's so fucking sad.

4076
03:52:44,790 --> 03:52:48,890
Like, Rue's biggest fear is losing his balls.

4077
03:52:49,490 --> 03:52:52,640
And then like...

4078
03:52:52,950 --> 03:52:53,690
Wait, what's this?

4079
03:52:54,390 --> 03:52:54,630
Oh.

4080
03:52:58,050 --> 03:52:59,810
Oh, this is where I have to buy.

4081
03:53:02,710 --> 03:53:06,670
And then like, Eeyore is just being like...

4082
03:53:06,670 --> 03:53:08,370
Eeyore is a lot of things, to be fair.

4083
03:53:09,110 --> 03:53:09,590
Like...

4084
03:53:09,590 --> 03:53:12,210
Eeyore is a lot of things.

4085
03:53:12,370 --> 03:53:15,250
He's like, biggest fear about.

4086
03:53:15,750 --> 03:53:18,030
But like, Pooh is like, starving.

4087
03:53:18,510 --> 03:53:20,390
Pooh Bear is just like, being hungry.

4088
03:53:22,130 --> 03:53:23,770
Give me your fucking money.

4089
03:53:24,090 --> 03:53:26,530
How am I gonna get money for like, Eeyore's level?

4090
03:53:28,150 --> 03:53:29,670
Oh my god.

4091
03:53:30,050 --> 03:53:31,330
God damn it!

4092
03:53:32,410 --> 03:53:33,830
Stupid Eeyore!

4093
03:53:35,510 --> 03:53:37,770
Stupid fucking door!

4094
03:53:45,620 --> 03:53:47,200
God damn it.

4095
03:53:47,660 --> 03:53:49,840
Okay, we can burn stuff down.

4096
03:53:50,940 --> 03:53:52,820
Ow, I'm hungry.

4097
03:53:53,400 --> 03:53:54,680
God damn it!

4098
03:53:54,840 --> 03:53:56,560
I have to grind so many cookies!

4099
03:53:58,940 --> 03:54:01,180
Okay, we can burn this though.

4100
03:54:03,520 --> 03:54:04,560
Alright, burn that.

4101
03:54:04,680 --> 03:54:05,180
Wax you.

4102
03:54:08,520 --> 03:54:11,040
Do not like that sound effect at all.

4103
03:54:12,640 --> 03:54:14,080
Guys, how long is this game?

4104
03:54:15,860 --> 03:54:17,600
Can I even finish it?

4105
03:54:19,240 --> 03:54:21,040
This game is E for everyone.

4106
03:54:21,180 --> 03:54:22,440
Well, I never finished it.

4107
03:54:22,460 --> 03:54:23,860
Cause I got too scared.

4108
03:54:24,480 --> 03:54:25,440
But thank you for the super chat.

4109
03:54:25,680 --> 03:54:26,800
Thank you.

4110
03:54:30,880 --> 03:54:31,820
Five hours.

4111
03:54:31,820 --> 03:54:32,220
That's wonderful.

4112
03:54:32,580 --> 03:54:35,100
To be fair, we got a little behind.

4113
03:54:35,280 --> 03:54:37,780
Because of my one hour life update.

4114
03:54:38,320 --> 03:54:41,060
Plus, Owl knowing what I did.

4115
03:54:41,540 --> 03:54:43,560
And softlocking me.

4116
03:54:47,360 --> 03:54:49,280
Now, Tigger and Rabbit.

4117
03:54:57,200 --> 03:54:57,920
What?

4118
03:54:58,680 --> 03:54:59,600
Oh no, math.

4119
03:54:59,600 --> 03:55:01,320
Oh no.

4120
03:55:02,380 --> 03:55:03,480
Oh no.

4121
03:55:04,480 --> 03:55:06,260
I clearly have to move this, right?

4122
03:55:07,800 --> 03:55:08,440
Yeah.

4123
03:55:08,740 --> 03:55:09,940
So I can get up here.

4124
03:55:13,690 --> 03:55:14,330
Yay!

4125
03:55:17,290 --> 03:55:19,210
And then, what do I do here?

4126
03:55:24,090 --> 03:55:25,030
Oh, here.

4127
03:55:26,090 --> 03:55:27,570
I have to...

4128
03:55:27,570 --> 03:55:28,210
Come on.

4129
03:55:28,710 --> 03:55:29,690
Come on, Piglet.

4130
03:55:29,690 --> 03:55:30,910
You have to push it.

4131
03:55:31,130 --> 03:55:32,490
To the blowy thing.

4132
03:55:35,730 --> 03:55:36,170
Key!

4133
03:55:37,630 --> 03:55:38,510
That's the...

4134
03:55:39,090 --> 03:55:40,410
The museum thing.

4135
03:55:46,770 --> 03:55:48,070
No, I'm definitely not smart.

4136
03:55:48,250 --> 03:55:49,810
Well, I mean, he's losing his memory.

4137
03:55:50,010 --> 03:55:50,850
But now I am.

4138
03:55:53,530 --> 03:55:54,930
Alexander, welcome to the farm!

4139
03:55:55,030 --> 03:55:55,690
Welcome, welcome!

4140
03:56:02,590 --> 03:56:03,310
And then...

4141
03:56:03,310 --> 03:56:04,170
What do I do with the eraser?

4142
03:56:04,790 --> 03:56:06,330
I guess I push it out?

4143
03:56:08,490 --> 03:56:10,210
I don't know what else to do with it.

4144
03:56:10,330 --> 03:56:11,590
Is there gonna be like a diving board?

4145
03:56:14,050 --> 03:56:15,850
I know if I push it up here, like...

4146
03:56:15,850 --> 03:56:17,130
It's gonna...

4147
03:56:17,130 --> 03:56:18,210
I can't push it back.

4148
03:56:25,240 --> 03:56:26,560
Oh, I found the painting!

4149
03:56:28,100 --> 03:56:28,820
Yes, family!

4150
03:56:33,790 --> 03:56:35,090
Okay, we have one of the paintings.

4151
03:56:42,990 --> 03:56:43,230
Okay.

4152
03:56:43,230 --> 03:56:43,990
What do I have?

4153
03:56:44,050 --> 03:56:44,990
Okay, I have fire.

4154
03:56:48,410 --> 03:56:48,650
Okay.

4155
03:56:52,390 --> 03:56:54,070
Okay, wait, I should be able to kick something.

4156
03:56:54,850 --> 03:56:56,210
Wait, is there anything I can kick here?

4157
03:56:57,210 --> 03:56:58,130
Please, I need cookies.

4158
03:56:59,790 --> 03:57:00,870
Oh my god, I'm gonna scratch myself.

4159
03:57:01,410 --> 03:57:01,870
Please, sir.

4160
03:57:02,430 --> 03:57:03,650
Oh my god, don't make me scratch myself.

4161
03:57:03,650 --> 03:57:05,630
I need cookies, come on, please.

4162
03:57:05,850 --> 03:57:06,950
Just one cookie.

4163
03:57:07,390 --> 03:57:10,010
Please, I need just one.

4164
03:57:10,350 --> 03:57:11,430
Just one little cookie.

4165
03:57:11,910 --> 03:57:12,450
Come on.

4166
03:57:12,890 --> 03:57:13,970
Come on, sir.

4167
03:57:15,450 --> 03:57:17,790
Why is there no cookies here?

4168
03:57:20,770 --> 03:57:21,930
Cookie, please.

4169
03:57:24,430 --> 03:57:26,930
Oh my god, there's no cookies here!

4170
03:57:29,590 --> 03:57:31,310
I got the cookie itch.

4171
03:57:32,310 --> 03:57:33,930
I'm too far gone.

4172
03:57:34,830 --> 03:57:35,490
Blake!

4173
03:57:35,970 --> 03:57:36,630
Where?

4174
03:57:37,550 --> 03:57:39,450
Give me that cookie.

4175
03:57:41,090 --> 03:57:42,230
Okay, there we go.

4176
03:57:42,310 --> 03:57:43,290
We got one cookie here.

4177
03:57:43,770 --> 03:57:45,010
Where are the other cookies?

4178
03:57:47,830 --> 03:57:49,010
Do we have extra?

4179
03:57:49,190 --> 03:57:51,330
Oh my god, I missed three here.

4180
03:57:52,990 --> 03:57:53,650
87...

4181
03:57:54,830 --> 03:57:55,490
88...

4182
03:57:55,490 --> 03:57:57,010
Okay, we need two more.

4183
03:57:57,990 --> 03:57:59,510
Okay, one more.

4184
03:57:59,510 --> 03:58:01,730
Please, sir.

4185
03:58:01,730 --> 03:58:02,030
Thank you.

4186
03:58:02,310 --> 03:58:05,810
Okay, I got the cookies here.

4187
03:58:07,170 --> 03:58:09,230
Come on, we almost can't.

4188
03:58:09,270 --> 03:58:12,090
We need 11 more and I can afford another face.

4189
03:58:15,130 --> 03:58:16,790
I need another face, please.

4190
03:58:17,030 --> 03:58:18,410
They're gonna kill my family.

4191
03:58:19,010 --> 03:58:21,410
I just need one more face.

4192
03:58:21,890 --> 03:58:22,470
Please.

4193
03:58:24,270 --> 03:58:25,570
Just one more.

4194
03:58:26,830 --> 03:58:27,850
Okay, nice.

4195
03:58:31,920 --> 03:58:33,360
They're after...

4196
03:58:33,360 --> 03:58:34,740
They're after my family.

4197
03:58:35,320 --> 03:58:35,880
Please.

4198
03:58:37,120 --> 03:58:38,240
They have my...

4199
03:58:39,660 --> 03:58:41,220
Who are they?

4200
03:58:41,820 --> 03:58:43,000
I can't say.

4201
03:58:43,500 --> 03:58:45,180
I can't say who they are.

4202
03:58:45,540 --> 03:58:48,080
All I know is that...

4203
03:58:48,080 --> 03:58:49,800
Is that...

4204
03:58:49,800 --> 03:58:51,420
They're in these booths.

4205
03:58:51,460 --> 03:58:53,600
This is the only way to communicate with them.

4206
03:58:54,840 --> 03:59:01,400
This is the only way I can communicate with them.

4207
03:59:03,480 --> 03:59:05,020
This is the only way.

4208
03:59:05,500 --> 03:59:07,320
They know.

4209
03:59:09,080 --> 03:59:09,780
They know.

4210
03:59:12,120 --> 03:59:13,460
Okay, can I keep this?

4211
03:59:13,760 --> 03:59:14,880
I fucking knew it.

4212
03:59:15,220 --> 03:59:17,500
I knew that was a secret cookie stash.

4213
03:59:17,960 --> 03:59:18,740
I knew it.

4214
03:59:18,840 --> 03:59:19,820
You don't need this.

4215
03:59:20,320 --> 03:59:21,880
You don't even have your memories.

4216
03:59:22,380 --> 03:59:23,960
Oh my god, that's actually so fucked.

4217
03:59:25,260 --> 03:59:26,380
Give me the cookie.

4218
03:59:26,380 --> 03:59:26,400
Give me the cookie.

4219
03:59:27,600 --> 03:59:29,420
Oh my god, I just need one.

4220
03:59:30,640 --> 03:59:31,940
Just need one.

4221
03:59:32,220 --> 03:59:33,060
Oh thank god.

4222
03:59:36,020 --> 03:59:36,620
103.

4223
03:59:37,300 --> 03:59:37,760
Nice.

4224
03:59:39,080 --> 03:59:40,640
Okay, we got another...

4225
03:59:40,640 --> 03:59:41,260
Stash.

4226
03:59:44,680 --> 03:59:47,420
Christopher Robin doesn't understand the concept of currency.

4227
03:59:48,160 --> 03:59:49,820
All he knows is cookies.

4228
03:59:50,600 --> 03:59:51,840
This is all that is mine.

4229
03:59:51,840 --> 03:59:52,400
This is all mine.

4230
03:59:56,540 --> 03:59:59,960
Alright, I deposited my cookies into the box.

4231
04:00:00,560 --> 04:00:01,840
What is your message?

4232
04:00:03,620 --> 04:00:05,100
What the fuck?

4233
04:00:08,000 --> 04:00:10,080
What does the nose do?

4234
04:00:12,020 --> 04:00:13,820
The cookie monster Bobby.

4235
04:00:16,300 --> 04:00:18,380
Oh my god, guys.

4236
04:00:18,520 --> 04:00:20,000
I talked to the wrong monster.

4237
04:00:20,000 --> 04:00:22,320
I talked to the wrong monster.

4238
04:00:26,430 --> 04:00:27,950
Alright, we got...

4239
04:00:27,950 --> 04:00:29,910
We still need more cookies for...

4240
04:00:29,910 --> 04:00:34,230
I think the worst part is that we need to find enough for...

4241
04:00:35,750 --> 04:00:37,310
For the Eeyore level.

4242
04:00:37,450 --> 04:00:39,670
Because we don't have enough cookies for that.

4243
04:00:39,750 --> 04:00:42,250
So we might have to go back to Pooh Bear's level.

4244
04:00:42,430 --> 04:00:43,790
I did not farm enough there.

4245
04:00:43,910 --> 04:00:45,930
I fucking was so casual about it.

4246
04:00:46,270 --> 04:00:48,190
I was like, I don't need cookies there.

4247
04:00:49,290 --> 04:00:50,850
Everything will be fine.

4248
04:00:50,850 --> 04:00:53,410
But everything is not fine.

4249
04:00:53,750 --> 04:00:58,410
I learned the hard way that everything is not dodgeable.

4250
04:01:01,390 --> 04:01:04,070
I learned the extra hard way.

4251
04:01:08,490 --> 04:01:10,150
Things are not okay.

4252
04:01:12,890 --> 04:01:15,270
Okay, I think these guys die forever.

4253
04:01:16,070 --> 04:01:17,410
If I scare them in time.

4254
04:01:18,270 --> 04:01:18,830
Oh shit.

4255
04:01:19,510 --> 04:01:21,430
As I said, if I scare them in time.

4256
04:01:24,570 --> 04:01:25,050
Okay.

4257
04:01:25,250 --> 04:01:26,010
That should be two.

4258
04:01:26,110 --> 04:01:26,990
It's like two hits.

4259
04:01:28,850 --> 04:01:31,130
Hufflepuffs are two hits and woozles are three.

4260
04:01:32,470 --> 04:01:33,830
That's like the worst part.

4261
04:01:35,810 --> 04:01:37,110
Woozles are too strong.

4262
04:01:38,450 --> 04:01:39,050
There we go.

4263
04:01:39,070 --> 04:01:39,650
That's the key.

4264
04:01:41,090 --> 04:01:43,070
Should be another painting, right?

4265
04:01:43,230 --> 04:01:44,550
No, it's the treasure map.

4266
04:01:47,890 --> 04:01:49,690
Okay, we got the treasure map.

4267
04:01:51,070 --> 04:01:51,550
So...

4268
04:01:51,550 --> 04:01:55,230
We just have to go...

4269
04:01:55,230 --> 04:01:56,810
Let's go back up.

4270
04:01:57,330 --> 04:01:59,530
There's a lot of like backtracking here.

4271
04:02:00,070 --> 04:02:01,370
If I go to the left side.

4272
04:02:04,170 --> 04:02:07,570
Oh, if you collect their bottles, they stay gone?

4273
04:02:07,830 --> 04:02:09,850
Who's not gonna collect their bottles though?

4274
04:02:10,270 --> 04:02:11,170
I guess the child.

4275
04:02:11,330 --> 04:02:12,790
Cause the child would be like, bye!

4276
04:02:13,970 --> 04:02:15,150
Which makes sense.

4277
04:02:15,250 --> 04:02:16,350
The child wouldn't care.

4278
04:02:22,260 --> 04:02:22,780
Alright.

4279
04:02:23,480 --> 04:02:24,840
We go here.

4280
04:02:26,780 --> 04:02:27,460
Yeah,

4281
04:02:30,740 --> 04:02:32,000
I'm like absorbing their soul.

4282
04:02:33,160 --> 04:02:34,920
I keep it in my little collection.

4283
04:02:35,900 --> 04:02:37,060
Never letting them out.

4284
04:02:37,600 --> 04:02:38,780
So they'll live there forever.

4285
04:02:40,480 --> 04:02:42,020
Almost burned the map down.

4286
04:02:43,660 --> 04:02:46,220
No, nobody will get the treasure.

4287
04:02:51,450 --> 04:02:51,950
Alright.

4288
04:02:52,410 --> 04:02:53,270
Out we go.

4289
04:02:53,270 --> 04:02:55,370
Why is everybody hyped this game?

4290
04:02:55,450 --> 04:03:01,950
Cause this was 20 years ago and like a game normally would not be like this 20 years ago.

4291
04:03:01,950 --> 04:03:03,050
Oh my god.

4292
04:03:03,870 --> 04:03:04,950
It's so big.

4293
04:03:07,450 --> 04:03:08,990
Okay, is there rocks here?

4294
04:03:09,590 --> 04:03:10,790
Is there a cookie stash?

4295
04:03:11,150 --> 04:03:12,030
Oh, there has.

4296
04:03:12,310 --> 04:03:13,030
That tree.

4297
04:03:13,490 --> 04:03:15,110
That tree's a cookie stash.

4298
04:03:15,790 --> 04:03:16,510
Give me.

4299
04:03:16,970 --> 04:03:17,610
No!

4300
04:03:18,050 --> 04:03:18,690
No!

4301
04:03:18,890 --> 04:03:19,570
My cookies!

4302
04:03:27,890 --> 04:03:28,930
My cookies!

4303
04:03:29,490 --> 04:03:31,530
Oh, he died so fast!

4304
04:03:32,190 --> 04:03:33,290
Oh, he's a weak man.

4305
04:03:34,630 --> 04:03:35,610
Okay, that's good.

4306
04:03:36,770 --> 04:03:37,290
No!

4307
04:03:39,250 --> 04:03:39,770
No!

4308
04:03:40,870 --> 04:03:41,750
Oh, hey, dad.

4309
04:03:46,150 --> 04:03:47,010
Wait, what?

4310
04:03:47,850 --> 04:03:48,990
I have to be very brave?

4311
04:03:49,510 --> 04:03:50,010
Oh, shit.

4312
04:03:50,010 --> 04:03:50,950
Oh, shit.

4313
04:03:51,750 --> 04:03:53,690
Oh, it's the ultimate attack!

4314
04:03:54,270 --> 04:03:55,350
That's right!

4315
04:03:55,930 --> 04:03:57,450
Turn into a potion!

4316
04:03:58,050 --> 04:03:59,290
Let me absorb your soul.

4317
04:03:59,730 --> 04:04:00,510
Oh, shit.

4318
04:04:01,010 --> 04:04:01,630
Nevermind.

4319
04:04:01,810 --> 04:04:02,870
Let me get you first.

4320
04:04:04,410 --> 04:04:04,670
Okay.

4321
04:04:06,410 --> 04:04:06,730
Okay.

4322
04:04:10,150 --> 04:04:11,310
Oh, nice.

4323
04:04:11,750 --> 04:04:13,010
I'm so strong now.

4324
04:04:14,510 --> 04:04:15,730
Give me your soul.

4325
04:04:16,570 --> 04:04:17,250
Oh!

4326
04:04:17,250 --> 04:04:19,210
I just have to kill them!

4327
04:04:21,310 --> 04:04:22,550
Technically, they're not dead.

4328
04:04:22,850 --> 04:04:23,990
If you think about it, chat.

4329
04:04:24,450 --> 04:04:26,490
I just have their souls, which is different.

4330
04:04:27,390 --> 04:04:29,070
Okay, so I need like...

4331
04:04:29,070 --> 04:04:29,870
Oh, my God.

4332
04:04:31,670 --> 04:04:32,290
It's alright.

4333
04:04:32,410 --> 04:04:33,390
It's just one cookie.

4334
04:04:34,090 --> 04:04:36,210
It's not gonna affect the whole game, right?

4335
04:04:37,050 --> 04:04:38,350
It's just one cookie.

4336
04:04:39,510 --> 04:04:41,050
You know it all adds up.

4337
04:04:41,150 --> 04:04:42,090
No, no, no, no.

4338
04:04:42,130 --> 04:04:42,930
It's just one.

4339
04:04:43,590 --> 04:04:45,250
If I just leave one unattended...

4340
04:04:45,250 --> 04:04:46,670
That's fine.

4341
04:04:47,090 --> 04:04:50,450
It's not gonna add up because it's only one cookie that I forgot to get.

4342
04:04:52,530 --> 04:04:55,050
That sounds like a big...

4343
04:04:55,050 --> 04:04:56,250
Sounds like a...

4344
04:04:56,250 --> 04:04:57,970
Oh, I have to scare the tree.

4345
04:05:00,930 --> 04:05:01,470
Alright.

4346
04:05:02,070 --> 04:05:03,590
It's time to scare the tree.

4347
04:05:04,970 --> 04:05:06,030
Okay, tree.

4348
04:05:07,370 --> 04:05:08,110
That's right.

4349
04:05:08,230 --> 04:05:09,490
I'm here to scare you.

4350
04:05:12,640 --> 04:05:13,320
Oh.

4351
04:05:17,080 --> 04:05:17,760
Boo!

4352
04:05:19,240 --> 04:05:20,480
Goodbye, nature.

4353
04:05:21,000 --> 04:05:22,480
We don't need oxygen.

4354
04:05:23,920 --> 04:05:24,360
Oh, hey.

4355
04:05:25,260 --> 04:05:26,740
There's a painting here.

4356
04:05:27,380 --> 04:05:28,960
How do I get the painting down?

4357
04:05:29,460 --> 04:05:30,040
Oh, shit!

4358
04:05:32,060 --> 04:05:32,740
Magic!

4359
04:05:36,040 --> 04:05:36,720
Oh.

4360
04:05:36,920 --> 04:05:37,680
I don't need...

4361
04:05:38,560 --> 04:05:40,080
Who cares about the treasure?

4362
04:05:44,020 --> 04:05:44,720
Okay.

4363
04:05:50,200 --> 04:05:51,520
Piglet, you fool!

4364
04:05:51,600 --> 04:05:53,260
There could be cookies in there!

4365
04:05:55,860 --> 04:05:57,660
Piglet, there could be cookies!

4366
04:06:01,160 --> 04:06:02,460
Piglet, no!

4367
04:06:02,920 --> 04:06:04,360
There could be cookies!

4368
04:06:05,880 --> 04:06:07,060
Oh my god.

4369
04:06:07,140 --> 04:06:08,780
You stupid pig.

4370
04:06:09,300 --> 04:06:12,640
I missed out on the biggest cookie stash of my life.

4371
04:06:13,400 --> 04:06:15,360
My fucking cookies.

4372
04:06:16,160 --> 04:06:18,540
Piglet's a better person than me.

4373
04:06:20,980 --> 04:06:22,420
Piglet, our addiction!

4374
04:06:23,180 --> 04:06:27,120
We can't fix our problems if we don't get the cookies!

4375
04:06:31,540 --> 04:06:33,720
Oh, we already got a lot of cookies in this level.

4376
04:06:33,720 --> 04:06:33,760
Oh.

4377
04:06:36,660 --> 04:06:37,300
Okay.

4378
04:06:45,100 --> 04:06:45,740
Alright.

4379
04:06:46,080 --> 04:06:48,000
Now he'll remember.

4380
04:06:48,260 --> 04:06:49,660
Because we have both paintings now.

4381
04:06:50,440 --> 04:06:51,300
He's gonna remember.

4382
04:06:53,160 --> 04:06:54,180
Alright, owl.

4383
04:06:55,220 --> 04:06:57,020
I got the paintings.

4384
04:06:58,840 --> 04:06:59,980
Here you go.

4385
04:07:00,300 --> 04:07:02,860
Wait, I gotta put it in the...

4386
04:07:02,860 --> 04:07:04,220
I'll put it in here first.

4387
04:07:05,240 --> 04:07:06,120
Alright, owl.

4388
04:07:06,380 --> 04:07:07,340
I got your... Oh!

4389
04:07:07,460 --> 04:07:09,440
I got your great-grandpa owl.

4390
04:07:10,640 --> 04:07:12,120
Do you remember them now?

4391
04:07:25,520 --> 04:07:27,020
Oh, he doesn't remember.

4392
04:07:27,140 --> 04:07:29,200
Wait, but he remembers the Book of Memories?

4393
04:07:31,020 --> 04:07:33,800
You don't remember anything else but a fucking book?

4394
04:07:34,280 --> 04:07:35,080
Goddamn nerd.

4395
04:07:41,920 --> 04:07:43,940
I can play as a rat?!

4396
04:07:43,940 --> 04:07:44,840
Oh my god.

4397
04:07:46,800 --> 04:07:47,820
Sorry, Sharko.

4398
04:07:47,880 --> 04:07:48,680
Thank you for the superchat.

4399
04:07:48,800 --> 04:07:49,740
Thank you.

4400
04:07:53,880 --> 04:07:54,380
What?

4401
04:07:54,600 --> 04:07:55,260
You scared?

4402
04:07:55,760 --> 04:07:57,300
Oh, you want me to go in?

4403
04:08:01,480 --> 04:08:01,840
What?

4404
04:08:03,680 --> 04:08:05,300
Wait, and everybody called me a coward?!

4405
04:08:06,660 --> 04:08:07,820
Fucking little bitch.

4406
04:08:08,100 --> 04:08:08,400
Fine.

4407
04:08:09,180 --> 04:08:10,220
Oh my god.

4408
04:08:10,320 --> 04:08:12,000
Maybe I should just leave you like this.

4409
04:08:12,540 --> 04:08:13,280
Maybe I should.

4410
04:08:13,460 --> 04:08:15,880
I could live in your house because you don't know what's going on.

4411
04:08:16,800 --> 04:08:19,840
I could just be like, this is my house because you don't even know where you are.

4412
04:08:19,980 --> 04:08:21,020
And I'll put you in a home.

4413
04:08:21,180 --> 04:08:21,620
That's right.

4414
04:08:22,400 --> 04:08:23,180
That's right, owl.

4415
04:08:23,260 --> 04:08:24,740
I'm gonna fucking put you in a home.

4416
04:08:29,020 --> 04:08:30,480
That's so evil.

4417
04:08:32,960 --> 04:08:34,880
Eldritch Liam, don't leave me caught.

4418
04:08:35,160 --> 04:08:38,180
I say in front of 3,000 plus people.

4419
04:08:41,520 --> 04:08:42,660
Oh shit.

4420
04:08:43,700 --> 04:08:44,740
Wait, what?

4421
04:08:46,340 --> 04:08:48,060
Maybe Gopher can just dig it out.

4422
04:08:49,540 --> 04:08:51,440
Oh, I can light this!

4423
04:08:53,020 --> 04:08:54,980
No one will ever know.

4424
04:08:54,980 --> 04:08:55,260
Oh.

4425
04:08:56,060 --> 04:08:57,120
Okay, I'm timed.

4426
04:08:57,540 --> 04:08:58,040
That's fine.

4427
04:08:58,960 --> 04:09:01,220
It's just light three candles anyway, right?

4428
04:09:02,540 --> 04:09:04,000
I'm running, I'm running, I'm running.

4429
04:09:04,060 --> 04:09:04,560
Oh, it's four.

4430
04:09:04,640 --> 04:09:05,180
I can't count.

4431
04:09:06,200 --> 04:09:08,620
I'm trying to light it as fast as I can!

4432
04:09:10,840 --> 04:09:11,280
Whoa!

4433
04:09:12,700 --> 04:09:13,360
Okay, done.

4434
04:09:13,420 --> 04:09:13,900
We got it.

4435
04:09:14,240 --> 04:09:17,480
I'm gonna use the bathroom then while you fucking watch this cutscene.

4436
04:09:17,940 --> 04:09:18,380
I'll be right back.

4437
04:09:18,440 --> 04:09:22,100
I hydrated a lot because I can't find a fucking doctor!

4438
04:09:23,580 --> 04:09:25,020
I'll be right back.

4439
04:09:33,430 --> 04:09:34,070
Lore?

4440
04:09:34,330 --> 04:09:34,950
Okay, I'll stay.

4441
04:09:35,290 --> 04:09:35,910
I'll stay.

4442
04:09:36,710 --> 04:09:38,190
I'll stay for the lore.

4443
04:09:43,970 --> 04:09:45,530
Your book, owl.

4444
04:09:46,150 --> 04:09:47,730
Your memory book.

4445
04:09:58,390 --> 04:09:59,270
That's it?

4446
04:10:04,510 --> 04:10:05,530
I did it.

4447
04:10:08,090 --> 04:10:09,490
I did it.

4448
04:10:09,490 --> 04:10:10,670
You didn't even read it!

4449
04:10:10,730 --> 04:10:12,610
How do you get your memory back?

4450
04:10:24,870 --> 04:10:26,050
I did it.

4451
04:10:26,330 --> 04:10:27,210
Bro, what the fuck?

4452
04:10:27,230 --> 04:10:28,450
All he had to do was read.

4453
04:10:28,450 --> 04:10:29,710
All he...

4454
04:10:31,090 --> 04:10:32,170
There you go.

4455
04:10:33,090 --> 04:10:34,570
There you go, owl.

4456
04:10:34,750 --> 04:10:37,470
You don't have to be afraid of losing your memory!

4457
04:10:38,090 --> 04:10:39,310
Don't have to be afraid of dementia!

4458
04:10:40,630 --> 04:10:41,170
Congratulations!

4459
04:10:41,790 --> 04:10:42,530
We fixed it!

4460
04:10:43,570 --> 04:10:44,570
We fixed it.

4461
04:10:45,250 --> 04:10:46,970
If only it was that simple, right?

4462
04:10:48,890 --> 04:10:51,070
Okay, I need to use the bathroom for real though.

4463
04:10:51,970 --> 04:10:53,270
I'll be right back.

4464
04:11:49,450 --> 04:11:50,350
I'm back!

4465
04:11:50,790 --> 04:11:52,450
Thank you for the gifted ships!

4466
04:11:52,650 --> 04:11:53,570
Thank you!

4467
04:11:54,430 --> 04:11:56,010
It's time to farm.

4468
04:11:56,430 --> 04:11:58,230
We don't have enough cookies.

4469
04:12:03,050 --> 04:12:03,650
225?!

4470
04:12:03,650 --> 04:12:04,870
Okay, let's go to Pooh Bear's.

4471
04:12:05,050 --> 04:12:07,030
Let's go to Pooh Bear's dream first.

4472
04:12:07,830 --> 04:12:08,790
Oh my god.

4473
04:12:11,350 --> 04:12:14,870
How is there 225 cookies?

4474
04:12:18,230 --> 04:12:19,430
Mama Kanga...

4475
04:12:19,430 --> 04:12:21,350
We farmed that shit for so long.

4476
04:12:24,910 --> 04:12:26,570
Mrs. Kanga does not...

4477
04:12:26,570 --> 04:12:29,630
Mrs. Kanga kept being like, Wow, please clean up the room.

4478
04:12:30,750 --> 04:12:32,890
Of course I washed my hands, guys.

4479
04:12:36,930 --> 04:12:38,270
Wait, Bravest of the...

4480
04:12:38,270 --> 04:12:39,790
That's fucking right!

4481
04:12:40,550 --> 04:12:41,830
Get out of here!

4482
04:12:44,910 --> 04:12:45,830
That's right!

4483
04:12:45,950 --> 04:12:47,410
Oh, do they just run away?

4484
04:12:47,410 --> 04:12:48,970
No, it's fine.

4485
04:12:49,010 --> 04:12:50,650
I'm just gonna...

4486
04:12:50,650 --> 04:12:52,050
What am I supposed to do with this?

4487
04:12:53,370 --> 04:12:56,270
Bro, I can't even eat them like Pac-Man!

4488
04:12:58,610 --> 04:13:01,070
What am I supposed to do with this information?

4489
04:13:04,150 --> 04:13:06,190
Oh, they just fucking die.

4490
04:13:08,730 --> 04:13:10,950
Wait, they just die?

4491
04:13:11,550 --> 04:13:14,570
Like, what?

4492
04:13:17,410 --> 04:13:18,150
I mean, that's fine.

4493
04:13:18,570 --> 04:13:19,770
That's fine with me.

4494
04:13:20,350 --> 04:13:21,850
They just disappear.

4495
04:13:22,810 --> 04:13:24,270
They got heart attack, guys.

4496
04:13:25,510 --> 04:13:26,910
They got heart attack.

4497
04:13:30,900 --> 04:13:32,300
Alright, let's see.

4498
04:13:33,560 --> 04:13:34,000
Okay.

4499
04:13:34,260 --> 04:13:35,620
Which one has to be cookies?

4500
04:13:36,380 --> 04:13:37,300
Okay, I got that.

4501
04:13:38,080 --> 04:13:38,900
I knew it.

4502
04:13:39,040 --> 04:13:40,620
I knew there was a cookie stash here.

4503
04:13:40,880 --> 04:13:42,240
I think I need like 110.

4504
04:13:44,280 --> 04:13:48,280
Cause like, I don't have a lot of...

4505
04:13:48,900 --> 04:13:50,900
Is this a cookie stash?

4506
04:13:52,020 --> 04:13:54,520
Yeah, I need 110 left.

4507
04:13:54,820 --> 04:13:55,800
Come on, please.

4508
04:13:57,300 --> 04:13:59,080
They're gonna cut off my legs.

4509
04:13:59,280 --> 04:13:59,580
Please.

4510
04:14:00,000 --> 04:14:01,320
I just need...

4511
04:14:01,320 --> 04:14:03,180
I need 110.

4512
04:14:04,000 --> 04:14:05,720
They're gonna cut off my legs.

4513
04:14:06,200 --> 04:14:07,600
They're gonna cut off my toes.

4514
04:14:08,680 --> 04:14:08,980
Please.

4515
04:14:09,600 --> 04:14:11,340
I borrowed from the cookie monster.

4516
04:14:11,660 --> 04:14:12,880
It's too late for me.

4517
04:14:16,900 --> 04:14:18,640
Is this this cookie?

4518
04:14:18,860 --> 04:14:19,080
No.

4519
04:14:20,560 --> 04:14:20,920
No.

4520
04:14:21,860 --> 04:14:24,140
Where are there more cookies?

4521
04:14:32,000 --> 04:14:32,760
What kidneys?

4522
04:14:33,000 --> 04:14:34,460
I'm literally a toy.

4523
04:14:37,520 --> 04:14:39,920
I'm made of stuffing, chat.

4524
04:14:40,020 --> 04:14:41,220
What do you mean?

4525
04:14:41,500 --> 04:14:42,140
Kidneys.

4526
04:14:43,680 --> 04:14:46,040
I'm literally a plush toy.

4527
04:14:48,660 --> 04:14:50,280
What do you mean?

4528
04:14:52,420 --> 04:14:54,800
I borrowed from the Sesame Street Mafia.

4529
04:14:54,980 --> 04:14:55,960
It's too late for me.

4530
04:14:57,080 --> 04:14:58,280
There's no hope.

4531
04:15:01,260 --> 04:15:03,260
Alright, do you think these guys are gonna have a heart attack?

4532
04:15:03,700 --> 04:15:04,320
Rose, thank you!

4533
04:15:04,440 --> 04:15:05,480
Welcome to the tomato farm!

4534
04:15:05,580 --> 04:15:06,240
Welcome, welcome!

4535
04:15:08,300 --> 04:15:09,620
That's fucking right.

4536
04:15:11,220 --> 04:15:14,560
It's time to get a heart attack while I fucking get some cookies.

4537
04:15:17,720 --> 04:15:18,400
Oh, nice.

4538
04:15:18,480 --> 04:15:18,900
One cookie.

4539
04:15:19,100 --> 04:15:20,020
That's fucking right.

4540
04:15:20,020 --> 04:15:22,680
Oh, it does do it!

4541
04:15:24,620 --> 04:15:25,480
Oh, it does!

4542
04:15:25,640 --> 04:15:28,020
I don't know why it didn't give me...

4543
04:15:30,240 --> 04:15:32,720
They didn't let me have a Pac-Man thing earlier.

4544
04:15:33,860 --> 04:15:36,100
Okay, is that all of it?

4545
04:15:37,860 --> 04:15:38,760
No, it's fine.

4546
04:15:38,920 --> 04:15:39,980
They're not gonna give me cookies.

4547
04:15:40,040 --> 04:15:40,640
What's the point?

4548
04:15:40,700 --> 04:15:41,900
Just let him have a heart attack.

4549
04:15:47,940 --> 04:15:48,380
Okay.

4550
04:15:50,280 --> 04:15:50,820
Just...

4551
04:15:50,820 --> 04:15:52,520
Just let them have heart attacks.

4552
04:15:52,660 --> 04:15:53,780
They don't matter to me.

4553
04:15:54,640 --> 04:15:54,960
Nice.

4554
04:15:55,160 --> 04:15:55,800
Oh, thank God.

4555
04:15:57,220 --> 04:15:58,540
That's right, you don't matter.

4556
04:15:59,400 --> 04:16:00,760
The cookies matter more.

4557
04:16:04,320 --> 04:16:05,560
Okay, let's see.

4558
04:16:06,200 --> 04:16:07,480
Oh my God, thank God.

4559
04:16:08,360 --> 04:16:09,480
Thank fucking God!

4560
04:16:09,660 --> 04:16:10,620
Thank you!

4561
04:16:13,220 --> 04:16:13,760
Okay.

4562
04:16:14,420 --> 04:16:15,640
Is that all of it?

4563
04:16:17,140 --> 04:16:17,540
Is that all of it?

4564
04:16:17,540 --> 04:16:18,700
Yes, I know I missed one.

4565
04:16:19,160 --> 04:16:20,880
But like, is that all that matters?

4566
04:16:21,760 --> 04:16:22,880
I already got these.

4567
04:16:27,910 --> 04:16:29,130
John, thank you for the super chat.

4568
04:16:29,250 --> 04:16:30,390
No, you don't understand.

4569
04:16:31,130 --> 04:16:32,650
Don't you think it's time to understand?

4570
04:16:33,530 --> 04:16:35,070
It's not a me issue.

4571
04:16:35,250 --> 04:16:35,810
It's a cookie.

4572
04:16:36,030 --> 04:16:37,390
It's their fault.

4573
04:16:37,710 --> 04:16:39,270
It's their fault.

4574
04:16:39,390 --> 04:16:40,050
It's not me.

4575
04:16:40,210 --> 04:16:40,950
It's them.

4576
04:16:42,010 --> 04:16:46,190
Oh, I guess because I didn't catch them, they'll always spawn.

4577
04:16:46,190 --> 04:16:47,570
Because I don't have his soul.

4578
04:16:48,270 --> 04:16:49,590
Get in my stomach right now.

4579
04:16:51,090 --> 04:16:52,310
That's fucking right.

4580
04:16:52,990 --> 04:16:55,630
Get in my stomach right now.

4581
04:17:00,680 --> 04:17:01,320
Collectible!

4582
04:17:01,900 --> 04:17:02,920
I see.

4583
04:17:06,220 --> 04:17:07,680
It's a collectible.

4584
04:17:09,440 --> 04:17:10,540
It's for an achievement.

4585
04:17:15,200 --> 04:17:16,540
Their souls are collectibles.

4586
04:17:16,800 --> 04:17:17,080
Yeah.

4587
04:17:19,920 --> 04:17:21,880
That's why I have to catch them.

4588
04:17:22,000 --> 04:17:23,200
That makes sense.

4589
04:17:25,660 --> 04:17:27,440
Australian, thank you for the super chat.

4590
04:17:27,520 --> 04:17:28,380
Thank you, thank you.

4591
04:17:28,480 --> 04:17:31,100
Wait until Doki finds out about cookie clicker.

4592
04:17:31,580 --> 04:17:32,380
Bro, okay.

4593
04:17:32,820 --> 04:17:33,560
I'm gonna say it.

4594
04:17:33,580 --> 04:17:36,560
People who play cookie clicker mostly use an auto clicker.

4595
04:17:36,820 --> 04:17:37,560
Not even.

4596
04:17:40,020 --> 04:17:41,920
They don't even do it legit.

4597
04:17:44,380 --> 04:17:45,060
That's right.

4598
04:17:45,080 --> 04:17:45,980
I said it.

4599
04:17:49,680 --> 04:17:51,280
I fucking kicked for real.

4600
04:17:51,540 --> 04:17:53,320
I don't need no auto clicker.

4601
04:17:53,740 --> 04:17:55,460
All I need are these legs.

4602
04:17:57,480 --> 04:17:58,880
That's all I need.

4603
04:18:01,200 --> 04:18:03,160
I'm literally fucking kicking with my legs.

4604
04:18:03,220 --> 04:18:03,600
Look at this.

4605
04:18:03,900 --> 04:18:05,120
This is no auto clicker.

4606
04:18:05,180 --> 04:18:06,540
This is literally my hands right now.

4607
04:18:06,600 --> 04:18:07,000
Look at that.

4608
04:18:21,840 --> 04:18:22,620
That's right.

4609
04:18:23,580 --> 04:18:24,280
That's right.

4610
04:18:24,460 --> 04:18:24,900
Run!

4611
04:18:26,820 --> 04:18:27,880
That's fucking right.

4612
04:18:28,120 --> 04:18:30,060
Get in my stomach, you weasel.

4613
04:18:32,020 --> 04:18:32,540
Easy.

4614
04:18:34,360 --> 04:18:36,320
Okay, I got that already.

4615
04:18:36,700 --> 04:18:37,780
What have I not kicked?

4616
04:18:44,740 --> 04:18:46,860
What have I not kicked yet?

4617
04:18:47,380 --> 04:18:48,440
No, thank you.

4618
04:18:48,480 --> 04:18:49,460
Thank you for the super chat.

4619
04:18:49,540 --> 04:18:50,540
Thank you, thank you.

4620
04:18:54,300 --> 04:18:54,740
This?

4621
04:18:55,360 --> 04:18:55,800
No?

4622
04:18:57,960 --> 04:18:59,800
Wait, I think I'm almost done.

4623
04:18:59,860 --> 04:19:02,540
If I go to Rue's place, I might be able to grab more cookies.

4624
04:19:02,980 --> 04:19:04,680
Alright, it's time to leave this dream.

4625
04:19:05,840 --> 04:19:06,280
Yes.

4626
04:19:07,020 --> 04:19:08,820
I'm done with your dream, Pooh Bear.

4627
04:19:08,900 --> 04:19:10,200
I'm done invading it.

4628
04:19:18,120 --> 04:19:18,560
Alright.

4629
04:19:19,480 --> 04:19:21,100
I'm done playing with you.

4630
04:19:25,080 --> 04:19:26,960
I already got most of it.

4631
04:19:27,000 --> 04:19:29,240
Look, I just need 155 and it's not worth it.

4632
04:19:30,540 --> 04:19:31,080
195?

4633
04:19:31,640 --> 04:19:32,120
Where?

4634
04:19:33,280 --> 04:19:36,080
Where the fuck was 195?

4635
04:19:39,400 --> 04:19:41,360
Where the fuck was that?

4636
04:19:44,420 --> 04:19:46,820
Okay, I know for sure they're not here.

4637
04:19:46,960 --> 04:19:48,180
I cleaned up her house.

4638
04:19:54,640 --> 04:19:56,680
Oh no, there's no ones and twos.

4639
04:19:56,680 --> 04:19:57,380
There's no way.

4640
04:19:57,540 --> 04:20:00,200
I left like a couple of ones and twos.

4641
04:20:00,200 --> 04:20:01,080
There's no way.

4642
04:20:02,320 --> 04:20:03,600
There's no way.

4643
04:20:04,300 --> 04:20:06,220
I refuse to believe it.

4644
04:20:07,960 --> 04:20:09,800
It's fine, let them run.

4645
04:20:10,420 --> 04:20:12,940
I have five cookies to find.

4646
04:20:14,180 --> 04:20:15,700
Let them run.

4647
04:20:16,500 --> 04:20:17,900
Literally, this is more...

4648
04:20:17,900 --> 04:20:20,380
Literally, this is more important right now.

4649
04:20:24,340 --> 04:20:26,020
I won't watch them die.

4650
04:20:26,020 --> 04:20:26,120
I won't watch them die.

4651
04:20:28,920 --> 04:20:29,720
Yeah.

4652
04:20:31,040 --> 04:20:33,660
Oh, you're gonna die soon.

4653
04:20:35,640 --> 04:20:36,960
That's right.

4654
04:20:37,360 --> 04:20:39,180
You're gonna get a heart attack.

4655
04:20:43,820 --> 04:20:45,820
Oh wait, cookies.

4656
04:20:47,680 --> 04:20:48,080
Nice.

4657
04:20:48,480 --> 04:20:53,920
Okay, we're missing literally 10 more and we should be good.

4658
04:20:56,020 --> 04:20:57,500
Okay, 15 more actually.

4659
04:20:59,340 --> 04:21:00,400
I got them.

4660
04:21:01,360 --> 04:21:02,700
Okay, we got this.

4661
04:21:05,300 --> 04:21:07,540
God dammit, there has to be more.

4662
04:21:11,160 --> 04:21:12,480
Where's the cookie fun?

4663
04:21:15,080 --> 04:21:16,780
Oh wait, there's a rock here.

4664
04:21:17,480 --> 04:21:18,520
That has to be where the cookies are.

4665
04:21:19,300 --> 04:21:19,920
Okay, that's...

4666
04:21:19,920 --> 04:21:20,580
I already kicked this.

4667
04:21:20,660 --> 04:21:21,360
Oh, I knew it!

4668
04:21:22,680 --> 04:21:25,540
I can feel the cookies.

4669
04:21:25,840 --> 04:21:26,520
Nice.

4670
04:21:29,140 --> 04:21:30,200
Okay, 10 more.

4671
04:21:31,040 --> 04:21:32,720
10 more and we'll be free.

4672
04:21:33,520 --> 04:21:38,680
We'll be free for another level until the rabbit and tiger level.

4673
04:21:39,240 --> 04:21:41,600
And then they're gonna make me grab more cookies.

4674
04:21:46,640 --> 04:21:49,140
Then they're gonna make me grab more.

4675
04:21:49,600 --> 04:21:51,000
I can feel it.

4676
04:21:51,460 --> 04:21:53,220
I can feel it.

4677
04:21:53,800 --> 04:21:56,300
Rabbit and tiger are gonna be like, it's time.

4678
04:21:56,440 --> 04:21:57,820
It's time to learn more feet.

4679
04:21:57,940 --> 04:21:59,680
It's time to learn more moves.

4680
04:21:59,960 --> 04:22:00,420
Piglet.

4681
04:22:04,500 --> 04:22:04,980
Okay.

4682
04:22:05,600 --> 04:22:06,080
Nice.

4683
04:22:06,300 --> 04:22:06,480
Okay.

4684
04:22:07,360 --> 04:22:07,840
78.

4685
04:22:08,760 --> 04:22:09,860
Okay, we need two.

4686
04:22:10,580 --> 04:22:11,480
We literally need two.

4687
04:22:12,240 --> 04:22:13,800
We just gotta grab two and we're free.

4688
04:22:14,480 --> 04:22:16,020
We're free from the cookie mafia.

4689
04:22:17,500 --> 04:22:19,160
Are we ever really free?

4690
04:22:20,340 --> 04:22:22,880
Are we ever really free from the cookie mafia?

4691
04:22:24,420 --> 04:22:27,080
It's time to farm more cookies.

4692
04:22:27,300 --> 04:22:28,060
There you go.

4693
04:22:28,500 --> 04:22:28,780
No.

4694
04:22:30,840 --> 04:22:34,080
What more do you want from me?

4695
04:22:35,960 --> 04:22:38,420
What more do you want?

4696
04:22:39,420 --> 04:22:40,260
Please.

4697
04:22:42,220 --> 04:22:44,740
I've kicked my whole life.

4698
04:22:48,180 --> 04:22:49,020
Please.

4699
04:22:49,020 --> 04:22:51,020
What else is there to kick?

4700
04:22:56,060 --> 04:22:58,540
What else is there to kick?

4701
04:23:02,370 --> 04:23:03,690
I need two.

4702
04:23:04,530 --> 04:23:05,830
I just need two.

4703
04:23:07,970 --> 04:23:08,730
Please.

4704
04:23:12,930 --> 04:23:14,390
This one's harder.

4705
04:23:14,770 --> 04:23:17,010
Because it's like...

4706
04:23:17,010 --> 04:23:17,610
What?

4707
04:23:19,110 --> 04:23:21,110
What did I not kick yet?

4708
04:23:24,310 --> 04:23:25,490
Oh my God.

4709
04:23:27,210 --> 04:23:28,770
I feel like I kicked everything.

4710
04:23:29,130 --> 04:23:32,790
I feel like I'm just getting out-kicked.

4711
04:23:36,250 --> 04:23:37,150
Maybe like...

4712
04:23:37,450 --> 04:23:38,030
I don't know.

4713
04:23:38,170 --> 04:23:38,970
Maybe it's like...

4714
04:23:38,970 --> 04:23:39,970
Wait, is there anything here?

4715
04:23:40,830 --> 04:23:42,350
Oh my God, please.

4716
04:23:43,050 --> 04:23:46,050
There has to be one more place I haven't kicked yet.

4717
04:23:47,070 --> 04:23:48,210
Oh my God.

4718
04:23:49,050 --> 04:23:50,910
I can't even reach the cloud.

4719
04:23:55,550 --> 04:23:57,050
Piglet, please.

4720
04:23:59,010 --> 04:24:02,730
I need you to- I need you to find me more cookies.

4721
04:24:03,230 --> 04:24:03,670
Piglet.

4722
04:24:05,530 --> 04:24:06,850
Piglet, please.

4723
04:24:09,050 --> 04:24:10,510
Please, Piglet.

4724
04:24:13,850 --> 04:24:15,670
Oh my God, I'm out-kicked.

4725
04:24:16,270 --> 04:24:17,710
I kicked everything.

4726
04:24:19,370 --> 04:24:20,430
Oh my God.

4727
04:24:20,730 --> 04:24:22,250
Oh my God.

4728
04:24:22,250 --> 04:24:24,050
There's one cookie.

4729
04:24:24,790 --> 04:24:25,790
This is it.

4730
04:24:26,050 --> 04:24:28,250
Okay, we'll kill him real quick.

4731
04:24:30,650 --> 04:24:33,090
Okay, we'll leave him out of his misery too.

4732
04:24:34,010 --> 04:24:34,950
Get over here.

4733
04:24:35,790 --> 04:24:36,770
Get over here.

4734
04:24:37,470 --> 04:24:37,930
Asshole.

4735
04:24:38,050 --> 04:24:38,590
Get over here.

4736
04:24:38,890 --> 04:24:39,850
Get over here.

4737
04:24:40,190 --> 04:24:40,850
Get over here.

4738
04:24:40,990 --> 04:24:44,370
That's what you- Oh, that's the 3-4-1 special right here.

4739
04:24:44,550 --> 04:24:44,670
Oh.

4740
04:24:45,490 --> 04:24:46,570
Yeah, that's right.

4741
04:24:47,190 --> 04:24:49,250
Oh, you think you can get away?

4742
04:24:49,250 --> 04:24:50,710
You think you can get over here?

4743
04:24:50,890 --> 04:24:51,310
Get over here.

4744
04:24:52,630 --> 04:24:53,930
I'm gonna get you.

4745
04:24:54,030 --> 04:24:56,950
I'm gonna get you.

4746
04:24:56,950 --> 04:24:58,430
Come on.

4747
04:24:59,390 --> 04:25:00,690
Oh, you think you can run away?

4748
04:25:00,830 --> 04:25:01,270
Come on.

4749
04:25:01,330 --> 04:25:01,530
Oh!

4750
04:25:02,650 --> 04:25:03,750
That's fucking right.

4751
04:25:03,830 --> 04:25:05,150
You can't run away.

4752
04:25:09,930 --> 04:25:12,130
You can't run away from me.

4753
04:25:12,810 --> 04:25:13,290
Hehehehehe.

4754
04:25:18,270 --> 04:25:22,890
Just remember, you can never run away from the kicker.

4755
04:25:24,750 --> 04:25:26,550
There has to be one more cookie.

4756
04:25:26,610 --> 04:25:27,730
I literally need one.

4757
04:25:28,330 --> 04:25:31,070
Where are all the cookies- Where are all the one cookies I left?

4758
04:25:33,370 --> 04:25:36,670
Like, they have to be, like, secret areas or some shit.

4759
04:25:37,310 --> 04:25:39,330
I felt like I kicked everything around here.

4760
04:25:42,130 --> 04:25:45,110
Okay, maybe, like, maybe there's one in Rue's area.

4761
04:25:45,830 --> 04:25:46,910
There has to be.

4762
04:25:46,930 --> 04:25:48,730
I was not farming a lot.

4763
04:25:51,890 --> 04:25:53,610
I definitely could've farmed more.

4764
04:25:54,450 --> 04:25:55,450
Oh, there we go.

4765
04:25:55,490 --> 04:25:56,870
The one cookie I left out.

4766
04:25:58,630 --> 04:25:59,650
Oh, shit.

4767
04:26:00,450 --> 04:26:02,230
Okay, maybe it does add up.

4768
04:26:05,990 --> 04:26:07,410
I did kick the mailbox.

4769
04:26:08,470 --> 04:26:10,050
That was the first thing I did.

4770
04:26:12,130 --> 04:26:13,510
What's the point of this game?

4771
04:26:14,510 --> 04:26:15,110
Cookies.

4772
04:26:15,630 --> 04:26:18,090
It's just- It's just cookies.

4773
04:26:18,810 --> 04:26:19,410
Hehehehehe.

4774
04:26:20,550 --> 04:26:23,590
It's just fucking cookies, man.

4775
04:26:27,890 --> 04:26:28,790
There's two here.

4776
04:26:29,190 --> 04:26:35,090
I'm just gonna get these in advance, cause I know- I know that rabbit level is gonna be like, Wow, Piglet!

4777
04:26:35,550 --> 04:26:37,810
You need more fucking faces!

4778
04:26:39,290 --> 04:26:40,750
Okay, let's leave.

4779
04:26:41,230 --> 04:26:42,810
We can leave now.

4780
04:26:53,000 --> 04:26:56,600
Instead of cookie clicker, we're cookie kicker.

4781
04:26:57,460 --> 04:26:59,140
Alright, this is it, Eeyore.

4782
04:26:59,240 --> 04:27:00,060
I'm coming back.

4783
04:27:00,480 --> 04:27:01,820
Don't worry, Eeyore!

4784
04:27:03,040 --> 04:27:04,120
Don't worry!

4785
04:27:04,740 --> 04:27:06,180
I'm coming back!

4786
04:27:07,140 --> 04:27:07,760
Eeyore!

4787
04:27:08,480 --> 04:27:10,600
Homies never forget a homie.

4788
04:27:11,620 --> 04:27:12,880
Oh no, he's having night terrors.

4789
04:27:13,980 --> 04:27:15,680
Oh no, he's having night terrors.

4790
04:27:16,140 --> 04:27:17,480
Don't worry, Eeyore!

4791
04:27:19,840 --> 04:27:21,720
I'm here to save you!

4792
04:27:27,280 --> 04:27:30,480
Oh no, I've been- I've been coughing for two plus months now.

4793
04:27:30,880 --> 04:27:33,720
I've been- I've been trying to get to a doctor, but...

4794
04:27:33,720 --> 04:27:35,280
We have a doctor shortage.

4795
04:27:35,580 --> 04:27:36,300
Oh yeah!

4796
04:27:36,980 --> 04:27:40,920
If you- If you just watch the first hour of the VOD, and you'll understand.

4797
04:27:40,920 --> 04:27:41,260
Oh man.

4798
04:27:45,240 --> 04:27:46,640
Wait, he's still alive?

4799
04:27:47,300 --> 04:27:48,840
What the fuck was the point?

4800
04:27:51,460 --> 04:27:52,440
Okay, nice.

4801
04:27:54,560 --> 04:27:57,300
Yeah, I've been like drinking a lot of tea.

4802
04:28:00,100 --> 04:28:02,700
I basically like drink tea every day.

4803
04:28:05,970 --> 04:28:08,990
Like the ones- Yeah, the herbal teas for the throat.

4804
04:28:08,990 --> 04:28:11,550
It's like special tea just for the throat.

4805
04:28:14,660 --> 04:28:16,140
Guys, I'm still too weak.

4806
04:28:18,840 --> 04:28:20,600
That's why I've been using the bathroom a lot.

4807
04:28:20,780 --> 04:28:24,520
Oh, I forgot to like heat up my kettle for more water.

4808
04:28:26,100 --> 04:28:26,540
Goddammit.

4809
04:28:26,620 --> 04:28:27,460
Oh my god, please.

4810
04:28:28,140 --> 04:28:31,180
Okay, I gotta learn a scary face and the music room.

4811
04:28:31,260 --> 04:28:33,120
Cause that's the one I didn't buy a face.

4812
04:28:34,040 --> 04:28:35,100
Alright, give me a sec.

4813
04:28:35,860 --> 04:28:38,140
I'll come back soon, Mr. Dwarf!

4814
04:28:38,140 --> 04:28:39,620
I'll come back!

4815
04:28:46,670 --> 04:28:47,850
You sure it's not COVID?

4816
04:28:48,170 --> 04:28:50,290
Apparently to the nurse, it's not urgent enough.

4817
04:28:50,450 --> 04:28:52,130
So like, fuck me, I guess.

4818
04:28:55,730 --> 04:28:58,070
She literally was like, it's not urgent enough.

4819
04:28:58,130 --> 04:28:59,950
So like, you just gotta figure this out yourself.

4820
04:29:09,700 --> 04:29:10,880
Alright, let's see.

4821
04:29:11,040 --> 04:29:11,840
Can I kick this chair?

4822
04:29:12,280 --> 04:29:13,280
I fucking knew it.

4823
04:29:13,860 --> 04:29:14,560
I knew it.

4824
04:29:14,600 --> 04:29:15,220
I'm gonna kick everything.

4825
04:29:15,640 --> 04:29:16,360
I'm desperate.

4826
04:29:16,720 --> 04:29:17,960
I'm so desperate.

4827
04:29:18,260 --> 04:29:19,420
I've been through so much.

4828
04:29:19,420 --> 04:29:21,460
I've kicked this door.

4829
04:29:21,740 --> 04:29:23,140
Oh my god, of course it's one.

4830
04:29:26,920 --> 04:29:27,700
Just go to- yeah.

4831
04:29:28,020 --> 04:29:30,640
The thing is, we don't have walk-in clinics here anymore.

4832
04:29:30,960 --> 04:29:34,160
We have to make an appointment to a walk-in clinic.

4833
04:29:34,240 --> 04:29:36,180
And I called eight different clinics.

4834
04:29:38,260 --> 04:29:40,300
Alright, what kind of face do I get this time?

4835
04:29:46,380 --> 04:29:47,840
Jesus Christ, what?

4836
04:29:50,460 --> 04:29:52,600
That's some Junji Ito shit right there.

4837
04:29:54,020 --> 04:29:57,640
That's like when the dad was like- No, what was it?

4838
04:29:57,660 --> 04:30:02,380
There was like a specific panel where one of them just opens his fucking mouth like that.

4839
04:30:07,840 --> 04:30:11,140
Piglet, I don't think- Piglet, I don't think that's normal.

4840
04:30:11,360 --> 04:30:12,980
A pig should not be able to do that, Piglet.

4841
04:30:13,080 --> 04:30:14,200
Okay, I can scare the door.

4842
04:30:15,080 --> 04:30:15,400
This is it.

4843
04:30:15,420 --> 04:30:16,300
I'm gonna kill a door.

4844
04:30:18,060 --> 04:30:19,260
Alright, get over here, door.

4845
04:30:19,360 --> 04:30:20,180
I'm fucking- get over here.

4846
04:30:20,180 --> 04:30:22,180
Get over here, I'm fucking- I'm so scary.

4847
04:30:22,560 --> 04:30:24,560
I'm so fucking scary now.

4848
04:30:25,920 --> 04:30:26,900
This is it.

4849
04:30:27,680 --> 04:30:28,780
That's right!

4850
04:30:29,960 --> 04:30:31,780
I learned a new move!

4851
04:30:31,820 --> 04:30:33,020
I found the cookies!

4852
04:30:37,720 --> 04:30:38,060
Okay.

4853
04:30:41,540 --> 04:30:43,580
Cookie Mafia sent me.

4854
04:30:48,140 --> 04:30:48,520
Whoa.

4855
04:30:49,600 --> 04:30:49,780
Eeyore?

4856
04:30:50,060 --> 04:30:50,540
Eeyore!

4857
04:30:51,080 --> 04:30:51,600
Eeyore!

4858
04:30:51,600 --> 04:30:53,060
Give me your hand!

4859
04:30:53,120 --> 04:30:53,640
Okay.

4860
04:30:55,300 --> 04:30:57,320
Eeyore didn't give a fuck.

4861
04:30:57,720 --> 04:30:59,120
This is why I didn't have my statue.

4862
04:31:00,200 --> 04:31:01,600
What the fuck?

4863
04:31:05,700 --> 04:31:07,060
He didn't help.

4864
04:31:07,740 --> 04:31:10,820
Guys, remember that he didn't even help.

4865
04:31:13,140 --> 04:31:14,280
Oh shit.

4866
04:31:19,740 --> 04:31:21,100
Okay, this is fine.

4867
04:31:21,100 --> 04:31:22,340
This is enough spaces.

4868
04:31:27,060 --> 04:31:27,960
That's right.

4869
04:31:28,160 --> 04:31:29,460
Get bubbled!

4870
04:31:31,360 --> 04:31:31,960
Oh.

4871
04:31:31,960 --> 04:31:32,560
Okay.

4872
04:31:33,120 --> 04:31:33,680
He doesn't care.

4873
04:31:34,200 --> 04:31:35,200
Get bubbled again!

4874
04:31:37,440 --> 04:31:37,940
That's right.

4875
04:31:38,240 --> 04:31:38,760
Oh, okay.

4876
04:31:39,220 --> 04:31:39,500
Okay.

4877
04:31:41,040 --> 04:31:42,240
Three times?

4878
04:31:42,520 --> 04:31:43,360
Three times the charm?

4879
04:31:43,420 --> 04:31:44,000
It's like Mario.

4880
04:31:44,760 --> 04:31:45,740
It's like Mario!

4881
04:31:48,700 --> 04:31:50,340
Three times the charm.

4882
04:31:53,720 --> 04:31:54,120
What?

4883
04:31:58,420 --> 04:32:00,100
Is this hole made for me?

4884
04:32:06,330 --> 04:32:07,530
Another one?

4885
04:32:15,520 --> 04:32:16,540
Piglet learns bubble.

4886
04:32:17,680 --> 04:32:19,140
But now he's in color.

4887
04:32:20,040 --> 04:32:20,720
So like...

4888
04:32:20,720 --> 04:32:22,980
Wait, does that mean I have to fight them three times?

4889
04:32:23,040 --> 04:32:24,060
Or two times?

4890
04:32:25,400 --> 04:32:27,420
Okay, I'm just gonna run a little bit.

4891
04:32:27,800 --> 04:32:28,340
There we go.

4892
04:32:29,220 --> 04:32:29,700
That's right.

4893
04:32:30,060 --> 04:32:31,000
Get over here.

4894
04:32:32,380 --> 04:32:33,740
I'm fast enough.

4895
04:32:34,800 --> 04:32:35,240
Okay.

4896
04:32:36,520 --> 04:32:37,240
Oh my god.

4897
04:32:37,340 --> 04:32:37,960
Oh my god.

4898
04:32:38,060 --> 04:32:39,080
Maybe I'm not fast enough.

4899
04:32:41,760 --> 04:32:43,260
How do I do worse?

4900
04:32:45,420 --> 04:32:46,480
Okay, that's fine.

4901
04:32:46,620 --> 04:32:48,060
I just gotta get to the third one.

4902
04:32:52,330 --> 04:32:52,770
Nice.

4903
04:32:56,740 --> 04:32:57,940
Three times the charm.

4904
04:32:59,320 --> 04:32:59,760
Okay.

4905
04:32:59,760 --> 04:33:00,060
But stop.

4906
04:33:00,200 --> 04:33:00,960
Thank you for the super chat.

4907
04:33:01,020 --> 04:33:01,280
Thank you.

4908
04:33:01,640 --> 04:33:04,540
For your penchant for cruelty and bullying nerds.

4909
04:33:04,560 --> 04:33:07,800
I was wondering if you ever wanted to play bully.

4910
04:33:08,300 --> 04:33:09,240
Thank you for the super chat.

4911
04:33:09,360 --> 04:33:09,560
Thank you.

4912
04:33:10,240 --> 04:33:15,480
The reason why I've never streamed bully is because I played bully all the way to the end.

4913
04:33:15,880 --> 04:33:17,980
That was like one of the few...

4914
04:33:19,280 --> 04:33:22,560
That was one of the few games I've actually played.

4915
04:33:27,360 --> 04:33:27,800
Like...

4916
04:33:27,800 --> 04:33:30,740
Not when they first came out, but it was like the scholarship edition.

4917
04:33:31,040 --> 04:33:33,800
I got the scholarship when I was like...

4918
04:33:35,400 --> 04:33:36,640
Not a streamer.

4919
04:33:39,000 --> 04:33:41,120
So I'm not going in blind.

4920
04:33:41,280 --> 04:33:42,820
I've actually played it to the end.

4921
04:33:43,900 --> 04:33:46,560
It's one of the few story games I've actually played.

4922
04:33:46,640 --> 04:33:48,840
Because normally I don't play story mode games.

4923
04:33:50,280 --> 04:33:51,240
It's a good game.

4924
04:33:51,300 --> 04:33:52,060
I actually enjoyed it.

4925
04:33:52,120 --> 04:33:55,440
But you're not getting a...

4926
04:33:56,440 --> 04:33:57,760
What's the word called?

4927
04:33:59,640 --> 04:34:00,440
Blind reaction.

4928
04:34:00,880 --> 04:34:03,540
Because I know the entire story in the game.

4929
04:34:07,820 --> 04:34:08,940
Thank you for the super chat.

4930
04:34:09,080 --> 04:34:09,860
Thank you.

4931
04:34:11,320 --> 04:34:12,660
That should be it, right?

4932
04:34:12,800 --> 04:34:13,640
It's three tries.

4933
04:34:15,240 --> 04:34:17,940
I've already progressed further than Little Doki.

4934
04:34:18,460 --> 04:34:20,340
This is the furthest I've ever progressed.

4935
04:34:22,400 --> 04:34:23,720
Loco, thank you for the super chat.

4936
04:34:23,720 --> 04:34:24,700
Thank you, thank you.

4937
04:34:25,100 --> 04:34:28,560
My Oshi playing the spooky, dooky, Silent Hill.

4938
04:34:29,000 --> 04:34:34,500
This truly will add more to Papa's garden.

4939
04:34:34,680 --> 04:34:35,380
Thank you for the super chat.

4940
04:34:35,460 --> 04:34:36,420
Thank you, thank you.

4941
04:34:37,140 --> 04:34:37,600
This is it.

4942
04:34:38,140 --> 04:34:39,080
I did it, Eeyore.

4943
04:34:39,080 --> 04:34:40,840
Oh, Eeyore, it's only you.

4944
04:34:41,420 --> 04:34:42,980
Sorry to have frightened you.

4945
04:34:43,360 --> 04:34:45,320
Seems to happen a lot.

4946
04:34:45,620 --> 04:34:46,960
Oh no, it's alright.

4947
04:34:47,200 --> 04:34:48,820
I'm very happy to see you.

4948
04:34:49,660 --> 04:34:51,860
Well, thanks for saying that.

4949
04:34:51,880 --> 04:34:53,660
I want to thank you, Piglet.

4950
04:34:54,200 --> 04:34:56,660
You brought the colors back to my dream.

4951
04:34:56,680 --> 04:34:57,120
There's no physics.

4952
04:34:57,460 --> 04:34:59,220
You lit the candles again.

4953
04:35:00,220 --> 04:35:01,560
Are you happy now?

4954
04:35:02,100 --> 04:35:05,040
There are no more Heffalumps in my house.

4955
04:35:06,080 --> 04:35:08,200
Because of me, Eeyore?

4956
04:35:08,200 --> 04:35:08,940
Yup.

4957
04:35:09,560 --> 04:35:12,360
And you did it all just to help me.

4958
04:35:13,080 --> 04:35:15,180
Thanks for cheering me up.

4959
04:35:15,380 --> 04:35:17,040
Your half-depression cured!

4960
04:35:18,000 --> 04:35:19,400
You're welcome, Eeyore.

4961
04:35:19,760 --> 04:35:20,580
I did it!

4962
04:35:20,660 --> 04:35:24,180
He still has a million other problems, like homelessness, but...

4963
04:35:24,180 --> 04:35:26,380
I cured his depression.

4964
04:35:26,720 --> 04:35:32,280
Despite his fears, if you wish hard enough for something, you can make your wish come true.

4965
04:35:34,040 --> 04:35:35,980
That is definitely not the story.

4966
04:35:35,980 --> 04:35:39,440
He still fucking lives in that fucking stick house.

4967
04:35:39,900 --> 04:35:41,980
At least he doesn't have night terrors anymore.

4968
04:35:42,180 --> 04:35:46,220
Having all the colors back kinda turns a grey day sunny.

4969
04:35:46,780 --> 04:35:48,680
Thanks for your help, Piglet.

4970
04:35:49,440 --> 04:35:50,480
We fixed him!

4971
04:35:53,980 --> 04:35:56,080
We fucking did it!

4972
04:35:56,220 --> 04:35:57,220
We fixed him!

4973
04:35:59,160 --> 04:36:01,480
All he has to do is wish hard enough.

4974
04:36:02,880 --> 04:36:04,120
Oh no!

4975
04:36:05,340 --> 04:36:07,540
There's no point in painting, Tigger!

4976
04:36:09,020 --> 04:36:10,320
It's raining!

4977
04:36:12,580 --> 04:36:13,880
His stripes!

4978
04:36:14,640 --> 04:36:16,260
Now you're not special.

4979
04:36:19,140 --> 04:36:20,900
Wait, that's what he's sad about?

4980
04:36:23,580 --> 04:36:25,360
Wait, what are his fears?

4981
04:36:25,360 --> 04:36:26,960
My carrots!

4982
04:36:27,540 --> 04:36:28,960
My carrots!

4983
04:36:33,660 --> 04:36:34,940
Okay, like...

4984
04:36:34,940 --> 04:36:36,320
Eeyore has an actual real...

4985
04:36:36,320 --> 04:36:38,360
Eeyore and an owl have real fears.

4986
04:36:39,100 --> 04:36:40,000
Not gonna lie.

4987
04:36:40,660 --> 04:36:41,360
Not gonna lie.

4988
04:36:48,340 --> 04:36:48,980
Like...

4989
04:36:48,980 --> 04:36:51,300
Owl and like...

4990
04:36:51,300 --> 04:36:53,640
Eeyore have like actual nightmares.

4991
04:36:54,260 --> 04:36:56,080
The rest is like...

4992
04:36:56,080 --> 04:36:57,060
Carrots.

4993
04:36:57,260 --> 04:36:58,640
And then the other is like...

4994
04:36:58,640 --> 04:37:00,600
I'm not special because I have no...

4995
04:37:01,300 --> 04:37:01,780
Stripes.

4996
04:37:06,280 --> 04:37:09,960
Alright, rabbit, I'm coming in.

4997
04:37:11,960 --> 04:37:15,580
I guess like his individuality, but he's the only one!

4998
04:37:21,300 --> 04:37:22,700
He doesn't have income!

4999
04:37:24,040 --> 04:37:24,900
It's just...

5000
04:37:24,900 --> 04:37:26,080
I guess like starvation?

5001
04:37:26,420 --> 04:37:29,420
Okay, I can see rabbit's fear as starvation.

5002
04:37:29,660 --> 04:37:31,040
Cause like it's literally his food.

5003
04:37:35,840 --> 04:37:38,160
Rabbit's fear is literally starving to death.

5004
04:37:41,520 --> 04:37:42,980
Don't worry, I got you!

5005
04:37:43,160 --> 04:37:43,480
Rabbit!

5006
04:37:43,480 --> 04:37:47,420
And that's exactly what he dreamt about.

5007
04:38:02,180 --> 04:38:05,120
What a disaster!

5008
04:38:05,500 --> 04:38:06,180
Use your hands!

5009
04:38:13,480 --> 04:38:13,740
Oh no!

5010
04:38:17,780 --> 04:38:20,440
I'll pull you!

5011
04:38:21,500 --> 04:38:23,660
Oh no, he's having a panic attack.

5012
04:38:32,400 --> 04:38:33,800
I'm gonna pull it!

5013
04:38:33,980 --> 04:38:36,100
Oh, but sorry, I just know how to use my legs!

5014
04:38:36,700 --> 04:38:37,560
Sorry, rabbit!

5015
04:38:39,060 --> 04:38:41,600
I just... I'm just a leg guy!

5016
04:38:42,260 --> 04:38:43,560
Using my arms?

5017
04:38:43,600 --> 04:38:44,340
What is that?

5018
04:38:44,480 --> 04:38:46,060
Oh my god, you collect all of this.

5019
04:38:46,220 --> 04:38:49,140
I need a hundred and twenty cookies!

5020
04:38:49,520 --> 04:38:50,520
Oh no!

5021
04:38:51,200 --> 04:38:53,660
I need a hundred and twenty cookies!

5022
04:38:55,380 --> 04:38:57,280
I got a farm.

5023
04:38:58,260 --> 04:39:00,000
We should get gopher in here though.

5024
04:39:00,300 --> 04:39:01,740
Maybe gopher knows what to do.

5025
04:39:03,500 --> 04:39:05,940
Okay, I can dig you out!

5026
04:39:07,240 --> 04:39:08,080
Got it!

5027
04:39:08,080 --> 04:39:08,280
Got it!

5028
04:39:10,500 --> 04:39:11,680
Don't worry, rabbit!

5029
04:39:14,600 --> 04:39:15,920
I know what to do!

5030
04:39:16,500 --> 04:39:17,280
Get over here!

5031
04:39:19,320 --> 04:39:24,140
Oh, I just said rabbit's fat.

5032
04:39:24,640 --> 04:39:25,220
I'm sorry.

5033
04:39:25,560 --> 04:39:26,220
I didn't say it.

5034
04:39:26,320 --> 04:39:27,240
The narrator said it.

5035
04:39:27,360 --> 04:39:27,680
Rabbit.

5036
04:39:27,920 --> 04:39:30,920
I thought I could just dig you out!

5037
04:39:32,060 --> 04:39:33,460
That's fucked up, narrator!

5038
04:39:34,340 --> 04:39:36,040
He's just big bone!

5039
04:39:37,460 --> 04:39:39,100
That's fucked up!

5040
04:39:39,780 --> 04:39:41,500
I would've done it, rabbit!

5041
04:39:43,280 --> 04:39:43,900
Guess not.

5042
04:39:44,240 --> 04:39:46,020
Guess the shovel is not used for digging.

5043
04:39:46,200 --> 04:39:47,000
Who would've thought?

5044
04:39:47,840 --> 04:39:51,340
You would think a shovel is there just to dig somebody out.

5045
04:39:53,620 --> 04:39:55,060
Alright, let's see.

5046
04:39:55,780 --> 04:39:56,540
Can I open this door?

5047
04:40:02,060 --> 04:40:04,440
I guess the giant beans are locked.

5048
04:40:08,900 --> 04:40:11,480
Alright, I guess we go this way, then.

5049
04:40:12,520 --> 04:40:13,240
Hello?

5050
04:40:14,040 --> 04:40:14,760
Heffalumps?

5051
04:40:15,140 --> 04:40:15,700
Woozles?

5052
04:40:17,080 --> 04:40:17,740
Oh.

5053
04:40:20,260 --> 04:40:25,340
In the 500 B.C., there were heffalumps and woozles.

5054
04:40:31,690 --> 04:40:33,470
I wonder why they never give them pants.

5055
04:40:33,570 --> 04:40:33,770
Whoops!

5056
04:40:36,370 --> 04:40:37,750
Whoops, went the wrong way.

5057
04:40:41,240 --> 04:40:43,200
Why do they never give them pants?

5058
04:40:48,140 --> 04:40:50,780
Ancient cave paintings.

5059
04:40:52,020 --> 04:40:56,080
I understand the gloves, because gloves are easy to animate, but what about pants?

5060
04:40:57,200 --> 04:40:58,280
Why is there always a shirt?

5061
04:40:59,940 --> 04:41:02,060
Okay, one of them has to... come on.

5062
04:41:02,660 --> 04:41:03,980
One of them has to have cookies.

5063
04:41:04,600 --> 04:41:05,880
There's 200 cookies.

5064
04:41:06,640 --> 04:41:08,500
I know there's 200 cookies!

5065
04:41:08,900 --> 04:41:10,060
Okay, I have to fight them.

5066
04:41:15,550 --> 04:41:16,150
Oh, shit.

5067
04:41:16,390 --> 04:41:16,670
Okay.

5068
04:41:17,290 --> 04:41:17,910
That's fine.

5069
04:41:18,390 --> 04:41:19,050
Wait, no!

5070
04:41:19,270 --> 04:41:19,430
No!

5071
04:41:20,410 --> 04:41:20,810
No!

5072
04:41:23,330 --> 04:41:24,090
Okay, there we go.

5073
04:41:24,110 --> 04:41:24,550
That's fine.

5074
04:41:25,770 --> 04:41:26,130
Okay.

5075
04:41:31,260 --> 04:41:32,500
We got the bubbles.

5076
04:41:39,360 --> 04:41:40,140
Is this okay?

5077
04:41:40,440 --> 04:41:41,100
Can you die?

5078
04:41:41,720 --> 04:41:42,360
Is it three hits?

5079
04:41:42,480 --> 04:41:43,120
Oh, it's three hits!

5080
04:41:43,300 --> 04:41:43,740
It's three hits!

5081
04:41:44,000 --> 04:41:44,480
No, no, no!

5082
04:41:45,360 --> 04:41:45,760
Run!

5083
04:41:49,140 --> 04:41:49,540
Okay.

5084
04:41:50,720 --> 04:41:51,380
That's fine.

5085
04:41:51,680 --> 04:41:53,040
I can do this in three moves.

5086
04:41:55,640 --> 04:41:56,440
That's fine.

5087
04:42:00,560 --> 04:42:01,540
It should be it.

5088
04:42:01,660 --> 04:42:01,940
Okay.

5089
04:42:03,220 --> 04:42:07,780
I now know that you can use X to move away.

5090
04:42:08,360 --> 04:42:09,400
Oh, thank God there's a cookie.

5091
04:42:11,000 --> 04:42:12,640
We gotta grab the cookie, though.

5092
04:42:13,400 --> 04:42:14,560
We're like a hundred away.

5093
04:42:14,640 --> 04:42:16,340
Just a hundred away, guys!

5094
04:42:16,620 --> 04:42:19,140
Just a hundred more cookies!

5095
04:42:21,700 --> 04:42:22,260
Okay.

5096
04:42:24,800 --> 04:42:26,120
Nice and easy.

5097
04:42:27,040 --> 04:42:27,760
Okay.

5098
04:42:28,560 --> 04:42:29,100
Alright.

5099
04:42:32,360 --> 04:42:33,860
Is that one, two hits?

5100
04:42:34,440 --> 04:42:35,280
God damn it!

5101
04:42:35,300 --> 04:42:36,420
You're so tanky!

5102
04:42:36,980 --> 04:42:38,380
We gotta learn a new move!

5103
04:42:40,040 --> 04:42:41,640
They're all three hits now.

5104
04:42:43,380 --> 04:42:44,440
Alright, nice.

5105
04:42:44,860 --> 04:42:46,600
And then...

5106
04:42:46,600 --> 04:42:48,020
That should be all of them.

5107
04:42:49,300 --> 04:42:50,020
Nice.

5108
04:42:50,860 --> 04:42:52,220
We've destroyed history.

5109
04:42:55,160 --> 04:42:56,020
That's good.

5110
04:42:56,260 --> 04:42:57,460
Destroyed natural artifacts.

5111
04:42:58,360 --> 04:43:02,020
We're gonna erase the Hufflepuffs and Wuzzles' history.

5112
04:43:02,900 --> 04:43:05,180
And their existence, so they never existed.

5113
04:43:06,320 --> 04:43:07,820
And they were never real, guys.

5114
04:43:08,220 --> 04:43:09,440
The Hufflepuffs and Wuzzles?

5115
04:43:09,540 --> 04:43:10,500
The fuck is that?

5116
04:43:14,580 --> 04:43:18,000
I didn't know Piglet was pretty.

5117
04:43:18,460 --> 04:43:19,280
Oh, shit.

5118
04:43:21,400 --> 04:43:23,180
We're gonna wipe them out.

5119
04:43:25,020 --> 04:43:26,220
Rewrite history.

5120
04:43:28,400 --> 04:43:29,340
Oh, nice.

5121
04:43:29,500 --> 04:43:29,700
Okay.

5122
04:43:33,160 --> 04:43:34,880
I think this part is the worst.

5123
04:43:38,320 --> 04:43:44,380
Because I know, I know that fucking door is gonna be like, you gotta learn three fucking moves!

5124
04:43:46,120 --> 04:43:47,400
I can feel it.

5125
04:43:47,480 --> 04:43:48,640
I can feel that door.

5126
04:43:49,160 --> 04:43:53,680
I can feel that door fucking coming at me and be like, you didn't learn enough moves!

5127
04:44:01,460 --> 04:44:02,600
No one's fucked up!

5128
04:44:04,900 --> 04:44:08,560
I basically entered people's dreams to make them like me more.

5129
04:44:08,920 --> 04:44:10,680
I manipulated them.

5130
04:44:11,380 --> 04:44:12,440
You think about it.

5131
04:44:13,020 --> 04:44:14,400
Yoki, this is a kid's game.

5132
04:44:14,580 --> 04:44:15,180
Yeah, so?

5133
04:44:16,760 --> 04:44:19,040
I'm gonna put my ideals onto it.

5134
04:44:24,480 --> 04:44:27,300
Well, seems to me it's missing a cog.

5135
04:44:27,960 --> 04:44:29,500
I'm sure I've got one in a shower.

5136
04:44:29,500 --> 04:44:31,700
Yeah, I'm brainwashing them to make them like me.

5137
04:44:32,160 --> 04:44:32,860
I don't have the key.

5138
04:44:35,160 --> 04:44:35,520
Okay.

5139
04:44:35,740 --> 04:44:36,700
Oh, he doesn't have the key.

5140
04:44:36,920 --> 04:44:37,460
Kick the bucket.

5141
04:44:39,860 --> 04:44:43,140
Okay, I need you guys to know, I disassociate when the gopher talks.

5142
04:44:43,220 --> 04:44:43,880
I really do.

5143
04:44:43,960 --> 04:44:48,520
I feel like he's whistling more than usual.

5144
04:44:51,260 --> 04:44:51,980
Oh, nice.

5145
04:44:52,040 --> 04:44:52,900
I got grain.

5146
04:44:55,920 --> 04:44:56,840
Ah, seeds!

5147
04:45:00,060 --> 04:45:01,280
Me too!

5148
04:45:01,860 --> 04:45:03,000
I just...

5149
04:45:03,000 --> 04:45:06,660
I literally just... I don't acknowledge him as a...

5150
04:45:08,280 --> 04:45:10,960
I don't even see him as an NPC.

5151
04:45:19,610 --> 04:45:20,110
Okay.

5152
04:45:20,110 --> 04:45:20,250
Okay.

5153
04:45:21,850 --> 04:45:24,110
I need like...

5154
04:45:25,870 --> 04:45:28,370
I need to find a thing over there.

5155
04:45:30,890 --> 04:45:32,790
Wait, then what do I have?

5156
04:45:32,950 --> 04:45:34,010
I have the shovel.

5157
04:45:38,830 --> 04:45:39,430
What?

5158
04:45:41,690 --> 04:45:43,610
What do I do with that?

5159
04:45:48,870 --> 04:45:49,430
Hmm...

5160
04:45:49,430 --> 04:45:51,290
There's like nothing here though.

5161
04:45:53,750 --> 04:45:55,950
It's like the only place I can go.

5162
04:45:56,670 --> 04:45:58,530
I guess there's something behind me.

5163
04:45:58,890 --> 04:45:59,850
Do I go back to rabbit?

5164
04:46:06,240 --> 04:46:08,260
No, I don't want to talk to gopher.

5165
04:46:08,840 --> 04:46:09,960
Don't do that to me.

5166
04:46:09,980 --> 04:46:10,940
Don't say that.

5167
04:46:11,800 --> 04:46:12,620
I feel like...

5168
04:46:12,620 --> 04:46:16,100
He used to not whistle every sentence.

5169
04:46:21,390 --> 04:46:23,010
There was a bird door?

5170
04:46:23,810 --> 04:46:25,450
No, that's the bean door.

5171
04:46:29,030 --> 04:46:29,790
That's a...

5172
04:46:29,790 --> 04:46:30,970
That's a bean door.

5173
04:46:33,970 --> 04:46:35,530
Where would I go?

5174
04:46:37,450 --> 04:46:37,970
Is there...

5175
04:46:37,970 --> 04:46:38,210
Oh!

5176
04:46:38,330 --> 04:46:39,570
Wait, no, that's just the exit.

5177
04:46:40,650 --> 04:46:40,950
Huh?

5178
04:46:44,690 --> 04:46:45,770
Every line?

5179
04:46:46,110 --> 04:46:47,370
I don't remember that.

5180
04:46:48,450 --> 04:46:51,310
It's definitely more annoying.

5181
04:46:53,210 --> 04:46:55,010
You want my bird seed?

5182
04:46:57,030 --> 04:46:57,870
Okay.

5183
04:47:01,130 --> 04:47:01,910
What did I do?

5184
04:47:07,430 --> 04:47:09,910
He doesn't want me to dig him out.

5185
04:47:17,690 --> 04:47:18,530
What?

5186
04:47:18,530 --> 04:47:18,970
What?

5187
04:47:23,380 --> 04:47:24,900
The Hufflepuff was?

5188
04:47:25,060 --> 04:47:26,140
Wait, was there another door?

5189
04:47:29,540 --> 04:47:30,360
Was there?

5190
04:47:30,580 --> 04:47:31,760
I thought it was just one door.

5191
04:47:32,320 --> 04:47:33,900
Okay, there's that big one.

5192
04:47:34,920 --> 04:47:36,060
Oh, what the fuck?

5193
04:47:36,100 --> 04:47:37,000
There's another door!

5194
04:47:37,440 --> 04:47:38,600
Here, here's my bird seed.

5195
04:47:46,980 --> 04:47:47,800
Wait, what?

5196
04:47:48,480 --> 04:47:49,340
Take my seed.

5197
04:47:54,200 --> 04:47:54,680
What?

5198
04:47:57,920 --> 04:48:00,280
But I have it right here!

5199
04:48:05,320 --> 04:48:07,100
Who has my fucking key?

5200
04:48:14,050 --> 04:48:15,290
Who has it?

5201
04:48:16,790 --> 04:48:17,770
Gopher, who has it?

5202
04:48:18,070 --> 04:48:19,250
I'm gonna dig you out of this hole.

5203
04:48:19,350 --> 04:48:20,110
Tell me where they are.

5204
04:48:26,570 --> 04:48:29,270
Eh, quite a problem, those birds.

5205
04:48:32,350 --> 04:48:34,590
How do I get to the birds?

5206
04:48:37,350 --> 04:48:39,530
Where do I drop these seeds?

5207
04:48:41,670 --> 04:48:44,190
I just want my cheese.

5208
04:48:47,170 --> 04:48:49,870
I just want my cheese.

5209
04:48:52,850 --> 04:48:57,970
Okay, I thought I tried to drop the seeds outside, but they had to stand in a specific area.

5210
04:48:58,790 --> 04:49:00,710
Because they wouldn't let me drop the seeds.

5211
04:49:03,430 --> 04:49:04,470
My cheese.

5212
04:49:04,550 --> 04:49:05,930
Ah, the fucking little smiley friends.

5213
04:49:09,370 --> 04:49:10,890
Take my seed!

5214
04:49:14,390 --> 04:49:14,990
Seed!

5215
04:49:20,130 --> 04:49:20,730
Please!

5216
04:49:24,830 --> 04:49:26,410
He's bottom right!

5217
04:49:26,670 --> 04:49:27,350
Where's his whore?

5218
04:49:36,490 --> 04:49:40,070
Okay, the tree was blocking the path.

5219
04:49:45,850 --> 04:49:46,570
Okay,

5220
04:49:50,550 --> 04:49:51,370
you how?

5221
04:49:51,690 --> 04:49:53,210
How would I like know?

5222
04:49:53,690 --> 04:49:53,910
How?

5223
04:49:55,410 --> 04:49:57,150
I'm fucking, oh no.

5224
04:49:57,330 --> 04:50:00,210
Oh no, he's gonna Oh no, oh no.

5225
04:50:00,290 --> 04:50:00,610
No!

5226
04:50:01,190 --> 04:50:04,010
He fucking scared me.

5227
04:50:04,530 --> 04:50:05,510
Now I'm scared.

5228
04:50:06,070 --> 04:50:08,690
Now I'm a scared little guy.

5229
04:50:09,710 --> 04:50:10,350
Oh, there's Tigger.

5230
04:50:13,830 --> 04:50:14,630
Wait, okay.

5231
04:50:15,670 --> 04:50:18,010
Oh wait, I'm gonna get rid of these guys.

5232
04:50:20,970 --> 04:50:21,610
Okay.

5233
04:50:23,770 --> 04:50:24,770
Booga booga booga.

5234
04:50:30,250 --> 04:50:31,970
Okay, that should be the last hit.

5235
04:50:36,350 --> 04:50:37,330
Alright, nice.

5236
04:50:38,510 --> 04:50:38,990
Consume.

5237
04:50:40,490 --> 04:50:42,410
Okay, now I'm a little bit scared though.

5238
04:50:43,350 --> 04:50:45,230
Okay, don't worry, I can still kick this tree.

5239
04:50:45,530 --> 04:50:48,990
I might be scared, but I can still kick.

5240
04:50:51,730 --> 04:50:52,690
Got this.

5241
04:50:53,510 --> 04:50:54,490
What else could be cookies?

5242
04:50:56,770 --> 04:50:58,010
This has to be cookies.

5243
04:50:58,150 --> 04:50:58,550
No!

5244
04:50:58,690 --> 04:50:59,930
Tigger, stop talking to me!

5245
04:51:04,990 --> 04:51:06,870
Tigger, get out of here!

5246
04:51:07,010 --> 04:51:08,830
I need to get more cookies!

5247
04:51:28,110 --> 04:51:29,470
Okay guys, give me a sec.

5248
04:51:30,290 --> 04:51:31,150
No, oh my god.

5249
04:51:31,910 --> 04:51:32,950
Tempo, message me.

5250
04:51:33,050 --> 04:51:33,590
Work time.

5251
04:51:34,310 --> 04:51:35,290
Tempo, message me.

5252
04:51:35,950 --> 04:51:36,670
Give me a sec.

5253
04:51:37,030 --> 04:51:40,210
Okay, I hope that the Huffle Dumps- oh my god.

5254
04:51:40,590 --> 04:51:41,690
Don't worry, we'll be fine.

5255
04:51:41,750 --> 04:51:43,490
He's not gonna come up to me, right?

5256
04:51:43,850 --> 04:51:45,510
If we stand here, we'll be fine.

5257
04:52:13,460 --> 04:52:15,180
Alright, there we go.

5258
04:52:17,420 --> 04:52:18,400
Alright, here we go.

5259
04:52:18,640 --> 04:52:19,240
This is fine.

5260
04:52:23,100 --> 04:52:24,220
Alright, this is it.

5261
04:52:30,640 --> 04:52:31,080
FUCK!

5262
04:52:31,080 --> 04:52:32,120
No!

5263
04:52:32,460 --> 04:52:33,580
I'm too scared!

5264
04:52:33,800 --> 04:52:33,980
No!

5265
04:52:34,120 --> 04:52:36,420
Okay, the worst part is that I'm slowly walking to me.

5266
04:52:36,440 --> 04:52:37,300
This is so fucked.

5267
04:52:37,600 --> 04:52:39,360
This is actually so fucked.

5268
04:52:39,460 --> 04:52:40,700
Oh my god!

5269
04:52:41,200 --> 04:52:41,660
Bro!

5270
04:52:42,540 --> 04:52:46,800
Why does he like slowly walk up to me?!

5271
04:52:46,800 --> 04:52:50,200
That's- Oh my god.

5272
04:52:51,200 --> 04:52:53,680
That's so fucking bad!

5273
04:52:54,220 --> 04:52:58,260
I just have to let him walk up to me.

5274
04:52:58,260 --> 04:52:59,760
Like, he doesn't even run!

5275
04:53:00,800 --> 04:53:02,460
This is so dead.

5276
04:53:06,080 --> 04:53:06,520
Okay.

5277
04:53:06,980 --> 04:53:11,220
Oh no, I didn't- Okay, I hope he doesn't say the same thing where he was like oh, you should've been there.

5278
04:53:11,280 --> 04:53:12,920
There were 200 million Huffle Dumps.

5279
04:53:14,920 --> 04:53:15,360
Okay.

5280
04:53:15,360 --> 04:53:16,340
That was torture.

5281
04:53:16,480 --> 04:53:18,580
Just watching him like slowly walk up.

5282
04:53:18,660 --> 04:53:19,500
That was actually torture.

5283
04:53:20,380 --> 04:53:22,020
How the fuck do I- okay.

5284
04:53:23,060 --> 04:53:23,700
No way.

5285
04:53:26,300 --> 04:53:26,780
Okay.

5286
04:53:26,780 --> 04:53:27,900
How do I do that, right?

5287
04:53:28,040 --> 04:53:28,620
This should work.

5288
04:53:29,680 --> 04:53:32,280
No way he walks back- oh, thank fucking god.

5289
04:53:33,000 --> 04:53:35,460
Oh my god, I hate you, Tigger.

5290
04:53:35,940 --> 04:53:36,120
Alright.

5291
04:53:42,680 --> 04:53:43,160
Okay.

5292
04:53:44,240 --> 04:53:45,180
We got this one.

5293
04:53:45,400 --> 04:53:47,520
The fucking Metal Gear Solid shit.

5294
04:53:49,280 --> 04:53:50,200
We did it!

5295
04:53:51,860 --> 04:53:53,340
Okay, we didn't do it.

5296
04:53:53,340 --> 04:53:54,120
Come on!

5297
04:53:59,740 --> 04:54:01,300
God, what?!

5298
04:54:02,840 --> 04:54:03,620
What?!

5299
04:54:03,620 --> 04:54:05,340
Excuse me?!

5300
04:54:12,780 --> 04:54:13,560
Okay.

5301
04:54:16,560 --> 04:54:20,860
Okay, I guess I won't- I don't know what his plan was.

5302
04:54:21,460 --> 04:54:24,100
Guys, the worst part is I have to do this all over again if I fuck this up.

5303
04:54:26,380 --> 04:54:28,640
If I fuck this up, I have to do this all over again.

5304
04:54:29,740 --> 04:54:31,460
If I fuck this up, I-

5305
04:54:34,920 --> 04:54:36,420
No way he sees me here, right?

5306
04:54:37,860 --> 04:54:38,300
Oh-oh.

5307
04:54:38,560 --> 04:54:39,160
Oh-oh.

5308
04:54:40,060 --> 04:54:40,660
Oh-oh.

5309
04:54:43,760 --> 04:54:44,480
Oh-oh.

5310
04:54:45,720 --> 04:54:46,400
Oh-oh.

5311
04:54:48,760 --> 04:54:49,420
Oh-oh.

5312
04:54:50,980 --> 04:54:51,500
Okay.

5313
04:54:51,680 --> 04:54:53,220
I don't know if this is a corner.

5314
04:54:53,460 --> 04:54:54,100
Is this a corner?

5315
04:54:54,640 --> 04:54:55,920
Is this a safety corner?

5316
04:54:56,100 --> 04:54:56,860
I can't tell.

5317
04:54:57,360 --> 04:54:58,460
I can't tell.

5318
04:54:58,800 --> 04:55:01,740
I can't tell if this is a safety corner, but I'm gonna go here.

5319
04:55:02,200 --> 04:55:03,800
I fucking- I hope this is safe.

5320
04:55:04,760 --> 04:55:05,280
No!

5321
04:55:08,180 --> 04:55:08,700
No!

5322
04:55:10,100 --> 04:55:10,480
No!

5323
04:55:13,380 --> 04:55:16,100
It looked like a safety corner!

5324
04:55:16,100 --> 04:55:20,100
It actually looked like a safety corner!

5325
04:55:20,640 --> 04:55:32,040
How is it not a safety corner?

5326
04:55:36,780 --> 04:55:44,560
Oh my god, three dozen?!

5327
04:55:46,280 --> 04:55:47,480
Oh my god!

5328
04:55:47,700 --> 04:55:48,780
Are you mad?!

5329
04:55:50,820 --> 04:55:53,020
Oh my god, that's crazy!

5330
04:56:01,740 --> 04:56:03,460
Oh my god, I'm gonna be so mad.

5331
04:56:03,700 --> 04:56:05,080
I fucking hate you, Tigger.

5332
04:56:55,020 --> 04:56:56,860
Show some respect!

5333
04:56:57,060 --> 04:56:58,000
He's a vetter.

5334
04:56:58,800 --> 04:57:00,440
Oh my god.

5335
04:57:01,160 --> 04:57:03,220
Oh my god.

5336
04:57:03,520 --> 04:57:04,040
Please!

5337
04:57:06,600 --> 04:57:07,180
Is this a corner?

5338
04:57:07,320 --> 04:57:08,260
A safety corner?

5339
04:57:09,600 --> 04:57:10,360
No.

5340
04:57:11,200 --> 04:57:11,960
No.

5341
04:57:12,280 --> 04:57:12,740
No.

5342
04:57:13,020 --> 04:57:13,600
No.

5343
04:57:14,160 --> 04:57:14,920
No.

5344
04:57:15,660 --> 04:57:17,740
No, this is not fair!

5345
04:57:18,400 --> 04:57:19,960
This is not fair!

5346
04:57:21,980 --> 04:57:24,000
There's no safety corners!

5347
04:57:24,840 --> 04:57:26,540
Look, he looks in that corner!

5348
04:57:26,820 --> 04:57:28,900
If I ran there, he would have looked in that corner.

5349
04:57:29,080 --> 04:57:31,720
If I ran there, he would have looked in that corner, chat.

5350
04:57:32,800 --> 04:57:33,780
Oh my goodness.

5351
04:57:34,680 --> 04:57:35,500
Oh my god.

5352
04:57:37,000 --> 04:57:38,280
The stealth machine.

5353
04:57:38,840 --> 04:57:39,580
Oh my god!

5354
04:57:49,130 --> 04:57:49,530
Okay.

5355
04:57:50,230 --> 04:57:54,290
Yeah, that's right, but he goes left, so I have to go backwards.

5356
04:57:58,890 --> 04:58:02,810
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

5357
04:58:03,090 --> 04:58:05,130
Fucking hate stealth so much.

5358
04:58:05,250 --> 04:58:06,050
I hate stealth.

5359
04:58:06,830 --> 04:58:07,090
Okay.

5360
04:58:08,610 --> 04:58:09,310
This is it.

5361
04:58:09,610 --> 04:58:10,450
I just gotta go for it.

5362
04:58:10,590 --> 04:58:11,530
I just gotta go for it.

5363
04:58:11,530 --> 04:58:12,890
The moment...

5364
04:58:13,850 --> 04:58:15,370
He goes back!

5365
04:58:15,410 --> 04:58:16,130
Okay, that's fine.

5366
04:58:16,170 --> 04:58:16,510
That's fine.

5367
04:58:17,010 --> 04:58:17,410
That's fine.

5368
04:58:21,130 --> 04:58:26,510
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

5369
04:58:33,160 --> 04:58:34,240
oh, oh.

5370
04:58:34,740 --> 04:58:38,240
Go, go, go, go, go, Tinker, go!

5371
04:58:40,960 --> 04:58:42,440
Oh my god.

5372
04:58:43,220 --> 04:58:44,880
Oh, thank god!

5373
04:58:47,300 --> 04:58:47,680
Oh.

5374
04:58:48,680 --> 04:58:49,880
Thank you for the superchat.

5375
04:58:50,060 --> 04:58:52,800
This game got stealth mechanics like Metal Gear Solid.

5376
04:58:52,920 --> 04:58:57,840
This game has every type of genre, from horror to tactical espionage.

5377
04:58:59,520 --> 04:59:00,300
I did it.

5378
04:59:01,460 --> 04:59:02,040
Piglet.

5379
04:59:03,300 --> 04:59:09,240
After fighting 5,000 Hufflelumps and 100,000 Weasels.

5380
04:59:12,580 --> 04:59:14,000
I did it, Piglet.

5381
04:59:14,220 --> 04:59:15,440
I'm no hero.

5382
04:59:16,700 --> 04:59:17,420
Okay, please go back.

5383
04:59:17,480 --> 04:59:18,600
We gotta get those cookies, Piglet.

5384
04:59:19,220 --> 04:59:20,780
Piglet, don't cross the lake.

5385
04:59:21,340 --> 04:59:22,920
We gotta get those cookies!

5386
04:59:23,800 --> 04:59:25,440
Use those legs of yours!

5387
04:59:25,660 --> 04:59:26,400
That's right.

5388
04:59:27,820 --> 04:59:28,880
Okay, 51.

5389
04:59:30,000 --> 04:59:31,480
We have more to go.

5390
04:59:31,640 --> 04:59:33,480
We have so much more to go, Piglet.

5391
04:59:33,540 --> 04:59:34,300
It's not over.

5392
04:59:34,980 --> 04:59:36,560
It's not fucking over.

5393
04:59:38,420 --> 04:59:40,300
We gotta figure out where would they live.

5394
04:59:41,040 --> 04:59:42,600
Where would the cookies live?

5395
04:59:44,100 --> 04:59:44,620
Nice.

5396
04:59:46,500 --> 04:59:47,620
Thank god, okay.

5397
04:59:51,730 --> 04:59:52,530
Nice, alright.

5398
04:59:53,690 --> 04:59:54,430
This is fine.

5399
04:59:54,950 --> 04:59:58,870
We just gotta find Christopher Robin to tell us to stop being sad, and then we'll be better.

5400
04:59:59,790 --> 05:00:01,770
We just need to find Robin.

5401
05:00:02,490 --> 05:00:08,810
Please, I need the motivation, that one thing you can only, one line you recorded in that studio.

5402
05:00:10,630 --> 05:00:11,930
Oh, there he is!

5403
05:00:12,630 --> 05:00:13,350
There's Croaky!

5404
05:00:13,650 --> 05:00:15,550
Wait, that shit looks like Croaky.

5405
05:00:17,630 --> 05:00:18,990
There he is!

5406
05:00:19,970 --> 05:00:22,170
He stole the fucking key!

5407
05:00:25,470 --> 05:00:28,270
We gotta get every Croaky macrocheat.

5408
05:00:30,110 --> 05:00:32,970
My god, why did it go so far this time?

5409
05:00:33,410 --> 05:00:34,070
Get over here.

5410
05:00:34,510 --> 05:00:35,210
I ain't afraid.

5411
05:00:36,450 --> 05:00:37,730
This is so trippy.

5412
05:00:37,810 --> 05:00:40,090
Every time I fight this guy...

5413
05:00:40,090 --> 05:00:41,270
Jesus Christ.

5414
05:00:42,150 --> 05:00:42,930
Oh, no!

5415
05:00:44,610 --> 05:00:47,730
Okay, the upside down one was fucking crazy.

5416
05:00:51,270 --> 05:00:52,030
What?

5417
05:00:52,590 --> 05:00:52,910
Again?

5418
05:00:54,350 --> 05:00:55,750
Oh my god.

5419
05:00:55,870 --> 05:00:56,810
I can't tell.

5420
05:00:57,090 --> 05:00:58,170
I can't tell!

5421
05:01:02,740 --> 05:01:05,020
Oh, thank god he's weak though, at least.

5422
05:01:06,580 --> 05:01:08,440
I'm just happy he's weak.

5423
05:01:09,300 --> 05:01:10,600
Thank fucking god.

5424
05:01:11,260 --> 05:01:12,340
Okay, no cookies.

5425
05:01:15,220 --> 05:01:15,980
Cookies?

5426
05:01:16,100 --> 05:01:16,460
No?

5427
05:01:20,180 --> 05:01:21,300
No cookies?

5428
05:01:21,300 --> 05:01:21,760
Cookies?

5429
05:01:27,600 --> 05:01:28,320
Cookies?

5430
05:01:28,440 --> 05:01:28,640
No?

5431
05:01:32,000 --> 05:01:32,720
Cookies!

5432
05:01:32,840 --> 05:01:33,400
Yay!

5433
05:01:38,200 --> 05:01:39,160
Okay, nice.

5434
05:01:39,200 --> 05:01:39,840
We got cookies.

5435
05:01:43,880 --> 05:01:45,160
Wait, what's this?

5436
05:01:45,680 --> 05:01:46,480
Oh, here!

5437
05:01:46,920 --> 05:01:47,720
Here's my seed.

5438
05:01:49,460 --> 05:01:51,240
Eat, you fat whore.

5439
05:01:51,240 --> 05:01:52,320
Eat.

5440
05:01:53,740 --> 05:01:54,240
It's okay.

5441
05:01:54,760 --> 05:01:56,280
We're close like that.

5442
05:01:56,660 --> 05:01:59,020
Croaky and I are close, I can say that.

5443
05:02:00,980 --> 05:02:02,000
That's right.

5444
05:02:10,120 --> 05:02:10,800
Guys.

5445
05:02:12,780 --> 05:02:15,320
Guys, I've been playing for five hours.

5446
05:02:15,760 --> 05:02:17,940
I'm not okay right now.

5447
05:02:17,940 --> 05:02:20,900
I'm not okay.

5448
05:02:23,940 --> 05:02:26,300
Oh my god.

5449
05:02:26,500 --> 05:02:28,380
I've been kicking for so long.

5450
05:02:28,780 --> 05:02:32,380
I've owned so many cookies in the Cookie Mafia.

5451
05:02:32,820 --> 05:02:34,220
I'm not okay.

5452
05:02:34,820 --> 05:02:38,700
All I do is kick for cookies.

5453
05:02:39,620 --> 05:02:41,620
I just kick for cookies.

5454
05:02:42,040 --> 05:02:43,360
I'm not okay.

5455
05:02:43,540 --> 05:02:46,220
I'm not okay, guys.

5456
05:02:47,320 --> 05:02:47,720
No!

5457
05:02:48,160 --> 05:02:49,380
My one cookie.

5458
05:02:50,580 --> 05:02:50,980
Okay.

5459
05:02:55,890 --> 05:02:56,290
Alright.

5460
05:02:58,470 --> 05:02:59,530
We'll go this way.

5461
05:03:07,550 --> 05:03:09,810
Is there anything I need to get from here, though?

5462
05:03:10,390 --> 05:03:11,470
Because I feel like...

5463
05:03:12,250 --> 05:03:13,470
I feel like...

5464
05:03:13,470 --> 05:03:14,150
I don't know.

5465
05:03:14,730 --> 05:03:16,130
Because I just needed the key, right?

5466
05:03:16,270 --> 05:03:16,970
So what would...

5467
05:03:16,970 --> 05:03:18,870
Oh my god, that means I have to backtrack back here.

5468
05:03:19,330 --> 05:03:20,890
I guess the cookies... Oh my god, thank you.

5469
05:03:20,890 --> 05:03:22,650
Oh my god, thank you, Christopher.

5470
05:03:23,670 --> 05:03:25,150
Now I'm happy.

5471
05:03:26,450 --> 05:03:28,410
Depression gone now.

5472
05:03:28,610 --> 05:03:29,990
It's that easy.

5473
05:03:30,790 --> 05:03:32,510
Not depressed now.

5474
05:03:32,610 --> 05:03:33,310
Let's go.

5475
05:03:35,510 --> 05:03:36,920
What the fuck is like...

5476
05:03:37,890 --> 05:03:38,690
Oh my god.

5477
05:03:38,830 --> 05:03:39,030
What?

5478
05:03:39,430 --> 05:03:39,830
This?

5479
05:03:39,970 --> 05:03:40,230
Okay.

5480
05:03:42,570 --> 05:03:44,650
Okay, who wants to fight me?

5481
05:03:52,720 --> 05:03:53,460
Nice.

5482
05:03:55,840 --> 05:03:56,360
Nice.

5483
05:03:56,360 --> 05:03:56,760
Alright.

5484
05:03:58,540 --> 05:03:59,580
Get out!

5485
05:03:59,900 --> 05:04:01,200
Get out, weasel!

5486
05:04:01,780 --> 05:04:02,280
Oh shit.

5487
05:04:02,420 --> 05:04:03,000
Okay, one more.

5488
05:04:03,700 --> 05:04:04,540
Last one.

5489
05:04:08,900 --> 05:04:09,420
Nice.

5490
05:04:09,540 --> 05:04:09,780
Okay.

5491
05:04:10,620 --> 05:04:11,920
I don't have to worry about him anymore.

5492
05:04:12,120 --> 05:04:12,440
Get him.

5493
05:04:14,300 --> 05:04:15,220
Wait, what?

5494
05:04:16,520 --> 05:04:17,900
Who wants to fight me?

5495
05:04:19,240 --> 05:04:20,120
Oh, him.

5496
05:04:20,580 --> 05:04:21,400
Look at me.

5497
05:04:22,700 --> 05:04:23,940
Look at me!

5498
05:04:24,060 --> 05:04:24,780
Okay, that's fine.

5499
05:04:24,860 --> 05:04:25,740
I'll just get the cookie.

5500
05:04:26,220 --> 05:04:27,200
Look at me!

5501
05:04:29,000 --> 05:04:30,200
Fight me!

5502
05:04:31,560 --> 05:04:32,280
Alright.

5503
05:04:32,580 --> 05:04:33,220
Oh fuck.

5504
05:04:33,440 --> 05:04:36,300
Oh no.

5505
05:04:37,260 --> 05:04:39,860
I cannot look upside down!

5506
05:04:41,180 --> 05:04:42,900
I can't look upside down!

5507
05:04:42,960 --> 05:04:44,320
My head can't comprehend!

5508
05:04:45,200 --> 05:04:46,900
Okay, this one I can.

5509
05:04:47,160 --> 05:04:47,520
Okay.

5510
05:04:47,520 --> 05:04:48,800
Oh no.

5511
05:04:51,560 --> 05:04:53,400
Alright, there you go.

5512
05:04:54,580 --> 05:04:55,320
Oh wait, what?

5513
05:04:55,700 --> 05:04:56,440
Oh shit, okay.

5514
05:04:56,820 --> 05:04:57,300
Gotta run.

5515
05:04:58,020 --> 05:04:58,780
Gotta run.

5516
05:04:59,820 --> 05:05:00,380
Okay.

5517
05:05:01,100 --> 05:05:02,580
That should give me enough steps.

5518
05:05:04,240 --> 05:05:05,660
That's like one more life.

5519
05:05:06,480 --> 05:05:07,020
Oh no.

5520
05:05:08,600 --> 05:05:09,400
Nice, I got it.

5521
05:05:12,180 --> 05:05:13,940
I can't read opposite!

5522
05:05:13,940 --> 05:05:14,300
That's it!

5523
05:05:15,700 --> 05:05:17,720
It's like when you try to look mirrored.

5524
05:05:18,020 --> 05:05:20,020
It like fucks with my head.

5525
05:05:27,460 --> 05:05:29,320
I don't know if I'm gonna...

5526
05:05:29,320 --> 05:05:31,620
I don't know if I can make it.

5527
05:05:33,700 --> 05:05:35,400
There's just so...

5528
05:05:35,400 --> 05:05:36,540
many cookies!

5529
05:05:40,080 --> 05:05:41,660
Alright, is that all of it?

5530
05:05:42,020 --> 05:05:42,840
No, there's more.

5531
05:05:42,840 --> 05:05:44,020
There has to be these.

5532
05:05:44,600 --> 05:05:45,440
I fucking knew it.

5533
05:05:45,760 --> 05:05:47,320
I'm like a professional now.

5534
05:05:47,680 --> 05:05:50,160
I can tell where all the cookies are.

5535
05:05:53,290 --> 05:05:55,210
Thank you for the super chat!

5536
05:05:55,390 --> 05:05:56,250
Thank you!

5537
05:05:56,290 --> 05:05:57,310
Wait, what's this?

5538
05:06:02,370 --> 05:06:06,370
Should I say I'm dumb?

5539
05:06:09,270 --> 05:06:11,210
Should I say I'm dumb?

5540
05:06:14,210 --> 05:06:16,330
Okay, it is backtracking.

5541
05:06:16,450 --> 05:06:17,370
I fucking knew it.

5542
05:06:17,510 --> 05:06:20,090
I knew this was a backtrack area.

5543
05:06:20,450 --> 05:06:21,350
I was like...

5544
05:06:21,350 --> 05:06:24,910
Okay, so we still have this area.

5545
05:06:25,090 --> 05:06:25,930
We got the key.

5546
05:06:26,430 --> 05:06:27,810
So I was like...

5547
05:06:27,810 --> 05:06:29,290
Of course.

5548
05:06:33,040 --> 05:06:34,520
No, I'm not gonna check the...

5549
05:06:34,520 --> 05:06:35,980
I'm not gonna check the other elephant.

5550
05:06:36,800 --> 05:06:38,240
There's no need to.

5551
05:06:39,380 --> 05:06:40,380
I need to get the...

5552
05:06:41,080 --> 05:06:42,380
I need to open the key.

5553
05:06:42,820 --> 05:06:43,880
In the birdseed area.

5554
05:06:43,880 --> 05:06:46,380
And then use that and get whatever he has.

5555
05:06:46,560 --> 05:06:48,100
And then go back...

5556
05:06:48,100 --> 05:06:49,700
Backtrack back to that area.

5557
05:06:50,080 --> 05:06:52,060
Because I'm assuming the birdseed area...

5558
05:06:52,060 --> 05:06:54,340
Is gonna open whatever the fuck I need to do.

5559
05:06:54,500 --> 05:06:55,660
In the other area.

5560
05:06:56,960 --> 05:06:57,560
Okay.

5561
05:07:00,770 --> 05:07:02,250
Oh, he's back?

5562
05:07:04,650 --> 05:07:05,810
Why are you back?

5563
05:07:05,870 --> 05:07:07,270
Nobody likes you.

5564
05:07:09,390 --> 05:07:10,490
Get out!

5565
05:07:11,650 --> 05:07:13,550
That's why you're trying to love yourself.

5566
05:07:13,550 --> 05:07:15,610
Because nobody else would give you that love.

5567
05:07:16,150 --> 05:07:17,410
Not even your mom.

5568
05:07:19,110 --> 05:07:20,910
Okay, I don't need aimbot anymore.

5569
05:07:23,970 --> 05:07:25,850
Alright, let's go back here.

5570
05:07:26,990 --> 05:07:28,310
I like him.

5571
05:07:29,510 --> 05:07:30,450
No you don't.

5572
05:07:30,550 --> 05:07:32,050
You're just saying that because you feel bad.

5573
05:07:32,130 --> 05:07:33,010
That's even worse.

5574
05:07:33,450 --> 05:07:34,170
That's pity.

5575
05:07:38,350 --> 05:07:39,930
That's even worse.

5576
05:07:40,370 --> 05:07:41,550
That's just...

5577
05:07:41,550 --> 05:07:42,390
Pity.

5578
05:07:47,910 --> 05:07:48,430
Alright.

5579
05:07:52,800 --> 05:07:54,040
I'll go this way.

5580
05:07:58,150 --> 05:07:59,910
It's because you feel bad for them.

5581
05:08:00,470 --> 05:08:00,830
Wait.

5582
05:08:01,170 --> 05:08:02,230
Do I need to go this way?

5583
05:08:04,730 --> 05:08:06,330
What's the key for?

5584
05:08:06,470 --> 05:08:07,870
Oh wait, it's for the birdseed area.

5585
05:08:08,050 --> 05:08:10,230
I went the wrong way.

5586
05:08:13,560 --> 05:08:15,060
Loli, thank you for the superchat.

5587
05:08:15,180 --> 05:08:16,280
Thank you, thank you.

5588
05:08:17,200 --> 05:08:18,220
It's called...

5589
05:08:18,940 --> 05:08:19,380
Petsy.

5590
05:08:21,060 --> 05:08:22,840
But you don't like him for him.

5591
05:08:23,040 --> 05:08:25,540
You like him because you feel bad for him.

5592
05:08:26,020 --> 05:08:26,740
That's worse.

5593
05:08:26,820 --> 05:08:28,140
You don't like him as a person.

5594
05:08:29,640 --> 05:08:31,500
It's just because you feel bad.

5595
05:08:35,710 --> 05:08:38,030
I'm sure the most down bad dragoons will kill you.

5596
05:08:38,150 --> 05:08:39,230
That's what she said.

5597
05:08:39,370 --> 05:08:40,950
Thank you for the superchat, Loli.

5598
05:08:41,070 --> 05:08:41,970
Thank you.

5599
05:08:47,490 --> 05:08:47,930
Alright.

5600
05:08:48,510 --> 05:08:49,370
Where are we now?

5601
05:08:49,370 --> 05:08:49,530
Oh.

5602
05:08:52,290 --> 05:08:53,550
What the fuck?

5603
05:08:54,310 --> 05:08:55,470
You too, rabbit?

5604
05:08:58,110 --> 05:08:59,710
What is up with...

5605
05:09:00,970 --> 05:09:01,870
Get over here.

5606
05:09:02,350 --> 05:09:03,350
Oh my god.

5607
05:09:03,450 --> 05:09:04,230
Get over here.

5608
05:09:04,650 --> 05:09:05,710
You're so fast.

5609
05:09:08,070 --> 05:09:08,650
Oh fuck.

5610
05:09:08,750 --> 05:09:09,790
Okay, we got one of them.

5611
05:09:11,990 --> 05:09:13,150
That's why I got you.

5612
05:09:14,170 --> 05:09:14,690
That's right.

5613
05:09:15,050 --> 05:09:16,410
Okay, we gotta corner you now.

5614
05:09:17,710 --> 05:09:18,150
No.

5615
05:09:18,930 --> 05:09:19,550
Get in the corner.

5616
05:09:21,910 --> 05:09:23,310
No, don't go there.

5617
05:09:25,170 --> 05:09:26,330
Oh my god.

5618
05:09:26,350 --> 05:09:27,230
He juked me.

5619
05:09:27,730 --> 05:09:28,470
What is this AI?

5620
05:09:30,510 --> 05:09:31,230
Oh my god.

5621
05:09:31,270 --> 05:09:32,370
What the fuck is this AI?

5622
05:09:34,250 --> 05:09:34,850
Oh my god.

5623
05:09:35,110 --> 05:09:38,810
You're so fast.

5624
05:09:40,210 --> 05:09:41,090
Okay, I got him in this corner.

5625
05:09:41,730 --> 05:09:42,170
It's over.

5626
05:09:42,170 --> 05:09:43,530
No way.

5627
05:09:43,670 --> 05:09:45,810
No fucking way.

5628
05:09:46,150 --> 05:09:47,710
I can't run faster than this.

5629
05:09:48,150 --> 05:09:49,150
Look at the legs.

5630
05:09:49,750 --> 05:09:51,810
Look at his legs.

5631
05:09:51,810 --> 05:09:55,310
Are you serious?

5632
05:09:56,370 --> 05:09:56,810
Thank you.

5633
05:09:58,190 --> 05:09:59,690
This is fucked up.

5634
05:09:59,810 --> 05:10:02,130
This is actually fucked up.

5635
05:10:02,930 --> 05:10:04,520
I can't run faster.

5636
05:10:05,990 --> 05:10:07,010
Oh my god.

5637
05:10:08,290 --> 05:10:10,350
You're such a bitch.

5638
05:10:12,590 --> 05:10:13,410
Oh my god.

5639
05:10:13,430 --> 05:10:15,170
This is actually torture.

5640
05:10:15,550 --> 05:10:16,830
This is torture.

5641
05:10:19,810 --> 05:10:20,730
There's no way.

5642
05:10:21,710 --> 05:10:23,010
There's no fucking way.

5643
05:10:27,130 --> 05:10:28,830
Oh my god.

5644
05:10:29,350 --> 05:10:30,670
Okay, last one.

5645
05:10:31,430 --> 05:10:32,990
I need to take them into a fucking...

5646
05:10:32,990 --> 05:10:34,530
I'm gonna lead them to this corner.

5647
05:10:35,390 --> 05:10:37,570
This is the dream corner right there.

5648
05:10:38,290 --> 05:10:38,630
No.

5649
05:10:38,630 --> 05:10:39,990
No, no, no, no, no.

5650
05:10:39,990 --> 05:10:40,630
No, no, no.

5651
05:10:41,850 --> 05:10:44,310
The right corner was the only corner.

5652
05:10:48,380 --> 05:10:49,400
Okay, we got...

5653
05:10:49,400 --> 05:10:52,580
By combining all the baby cogs, we made a big cog.

5654
05:10:53,020 --> 05:10:54,900
What did you do to the babies, Doki?

5655
05:10:55,680 --> 05:10:57,220
What did you do to them?

5656
05:10:57,400 --> 05:10:59,020
We got a big cog now.

5657
05:11:02,240 --> 05:11:03,200
You know what?

5658
05:11:06,080 --> 05:11:09,780
If I sacrifice all the babies, the mama cog will come out.

5659
05:11:14,690 --> 05:11:16,170
How many of these will it take?

5660
05:11:21,080 --> 05:11:21,820
The two?

5661
05:11:22,340 --> 05:11:22,720
No.

5662
05:11:27,640 --> 05:11:28,440
The three?

5663
05:11:28,720 --> 05:11:29,600
Okay, it's three.

5664
05:11:29,760 --> 05:11:30,460
Okay, that's good.

5665
05:11:30,940 --> 05:11:31,900
Okay, it's not as bad.

5666
05:11:33,080 --> 05:11:33,880
Three is not as bad.

5667
05:11:34,260 --> 05:11:34,800
Come on, fight me.

5668
05:11:35,880 --> 05:11:37,740
Okay, how many steps is this?

5669
05:11:38,520 --> 05:11:39,700
Okay, we can do it.

5670
05:11:40,740 --> 05:11:42,660
Oh, we can still do it.

5671
05:11:42,700 --> 05:11:43,460
We can still do it.

5672
05:11:47,100 --> 05:11:47,620
Okay.

5673
05:11:52,150 --> 05:11:53,350
Okay, third one.

5674
05:11:55,910 --> 05:11:57,570
I swear, is there a level after Tigger?

5675
05:11:57,850 --> 05:12:00,110
I swear to God.

5676
05:12:01,170 --> 05:12:01,690
I...

5677
05:12:02,330 --> 05:12:03,790
I'm about to give a super chat.

5678
05:12:03,850 --> 05:12:04,510
Thank you, thank you.

5679
05:12:04,790 --> 05:12:07,850
Okay, absorb.

5680
05:12:08,730 --> 05:12:09,250
Kick.

5681
05:12:09,250 --> 05:12:10,290
Kick.

5682
05:12:10,290 --> 05:12:11,690
Now it's kicking time.

5683
05:12:12,210 --> 05:12:12,690
Kick.

5684
05:12:13,190 --> 05:12:14,870
I don't have 120.

5685
05:12:15,250 --> 05:12:17,010
I'm sorry, Cookie Mafia.

5686
05:12:17,270 --> 05:12:18,890
I'm almost there, please.

5687
05:12:19,010 --> 05:12:20,410
I just need three more days.

5688
05:12:21,050 --> 05:12:22,930
Please, Cookie Mafia.

5689
05:12:24,350 --> 05:12:26,230
You know I'm good for it.

5690
05:12:27,170 --> 05:12:29,610
Just give me three more days.

5691
05:12:31,890 --> 05:12:33,270
I feel like I was like Piglet.

5692
05:12:33,310 --> 05:12:35,290
Must buy all the faces.

5693
05:12:40,830 --> 05:12:42,330
I just need an extension.

5694
05:12:42,570 --> 05:12:44,510
Please don't break my ankles.

5695
05:12:44,670 --> 05:12:45,830
Please, I just...

5696
05:12:45,830 --> 05:12:47,030
I'm almost there.

5697
05:12:47,150 --> 05:12:49,030
I just need 18 more.

5698
05:12:50,190 --> 05:12:52,190
You know I'm good for it, sir.

5699
05:12:52,910 --> 05:12:54,490
You know I'm good for it.

5700
05:12:54,590 --> 05:12:55,910
They got a reputation.

5701
05:12:56,190 --> 05:12:58,170
They can't make exceptions, Doki.

5702
05:12:58,590 --> 05:13:01,690
If they make an exception for you, they gotta make exceptions for other people.

5703
05:13:01,790 --> 05:13:02,750
They can't do that.

5704
05:13:03,570 --> 05:13:05,250
You know I'm good for it, though.

5705
05:13:06,230 --> 05:13:08,450
When have I ever let you down?

5706
05:13:10,510 --> 05:13:12,290
Where's the last one?

5707
05:13:14,490 --> 05:13:16,510
I'm gonna kick one more, but which one?

5708
05:13:18,350 --> 05:13:19,950
Them's the rules.

5709
05:13:22,810 --> 05:13:24,550
I'm missing one...

5710
05:13:24,550 --> 05:13:26,170
There's like one more box.

5711
05:13:27,330 --> 05:13:28,910
But which one?

5712
05:13:30,290 --> 05:13:31,250
Is this?

5713
05:13:31,530 --> 05:13:32,110
No.

5714
05:13:37,590 --> 05:13:40,670
This is what happens when you owe so much, Cookies.

5715
05:13:41,390 --> 05:13:46,070
When you've been farming for Cookies for what feels like 20 years.

5716
05:13:46,450 --> 05:13:47,690
It's not this.

5717
05:13:47,890 --> 05:13:49,510
I already farmed that, too.

5718
05:13:51,790 --> 05:13:53,190
Yeah, farm these.

5719
05:13:53,390 --> 05:13:54,270
Oh, what?

5720
05:13:55,270 --> 05:13:56,670
Wait, I thought I already kicked this.

5721
05:14:00,090 --> 05:14:02,150
Alright, we got this area.

5722
05:14:03,670 --> 05:14:05,090
I thought I kicked that already.

5723
05:14:05,310 --> 05:14:06,270
I was so confused.

5724
05:14:06,710 --> 05:14:08,490
Okay, I can't buy a face yet, guys.

5725
05:14:08,490 --> 05:14:10,530
I don't have enough.

5726
05:14:12,330 --> 05:14:12,790
130?!

5727
05:14:16,960 --> 05:14:18,900
They used to go by tens!

5728
05:14:23,310 --> 05:14:23,810
What?

5729
05:14:27,890 --> 05:14:30,530
When did they increase their interest rate?

5730
05:14:32,870 --> 05:14:35,390
They increased their interest rate.

5731
05:14:38,630 --> 05:14:40,190
I'm so poor.

5732
05:14:47,070 --> 05:14:49,030
Oh my god.

5733
05:14:49,910 --> 05:14:50,510
What?

5734
05:14:55,900 --> 05:14:58,180
Okay, I'll put a cog in.

5735
05:14:59,860 --> 05:15:01,380
I didn't give you a pool bear.

5736
05:15:01,640 --> 05:15:02,540
That's interest.

5737
05:15:03,720 --> 05:15:04,360
That's collateral.

5738
05:15:17,120 --> 05:15:26,180
I'm gonna take my chances.

5739
05:15:31,440 --> 05:15:32,840
Okay.

5740
05:15:32,840 --> 05:15:33,040
Yay!

5741
05:15:38,820 --> 05:15:39,460
Yay!

5742
05:15:45,180 --> 05:15:45,820
Okay.

5743
05:15:46,840 --> 05:15:47,800
That should be it.

5744
05:15:51,990 --> 05:15:53,010
We did it.

5745
05:16:03,200 --> 05:16:04,880
Yeah, because you didn't do it.

5746
05:16:07,260 --> 05:16:08,880
Yeah, because you didn't, gopher.

5747
05:16:09,540 --> 05:16:11,540
You couldn't even press buttons!

5748
05:16:12,280 --> 05:16:16,800
You know, gopher could literally stood at one of the handles, but he didn't.

5749
05:16:17,100 --> 05:16:20,960
He was just a supervisor and he gets paid ten times more than me.

5750
05:16:22,260 --> 05:16:23,740
I love capitalism.

5751
05:16:24,100 --> 05:16:25,660
I love it so much.

5752
05:16:38,700 --> 05:16:40,600
I did it, rabbit.

5753
05:16:44,060 --> 05:16:45,020
What do I do with the shovel?

5754
05:16:46,060 --> 05:16:46,500
Oh, what?

5755
05:16:48,260 --> 05:16:49,920
Oh, it's extracting!

5756
05:16:54,240 --> 05:16:57,840
Gopher makes a dollar, I make a dime.

5757
05:16:58,160 --> 05:17:01,780
That's why I kick for cookies on company time!

5758
05:17:02,180 --> 05:17:04,080
That's so good!

5759
05:17:09,320 --> 05:17:11,800
What do you mean?

5760
05:17:19,660 --> 05:17:20,700
What do you mean?

5761
05:17:20,700 --> 05:17:21,600
That's my life right there.

5762
05:17:21,720 --> 05:17:23,580
That's my life right there.

5763
05:17:24,180 --> 05:17:25,580
I got another key!

5764
05:17:26,600 --> 05:17:27,400
Key!

5765
05:17:30,260 --> 05:17:31,700
That's too real.

5766
05:17:32,220 --> 05:17:33,880
That's too fucking real.

5767
05:17:41,210 --> 05:17:42,690
I got in.

5768
05:17:44,570 --> 05:17:47,590
Gopher makes a dollar, I make a dime.

5769
05:17:47,590 --> 05:17:51,690
That's why I kick for cookies on company time.

5770
05:17:55,230 --> 05:17:59,780
It's time to- oh my god, there's fucking robots now?!

5771
05:17:59,780 --> 05:18:01,340
It's time to kick.

5772
05:18:03,420 --> 05:18:05,560
It's kicking time.

5773
05:18:07,090 --> 05:18:08,360
Oh my god, let's go gambling!

5774
05:18:09,140 --> 05:18:10,760
You can never escape gambling.

5775
05:18:11,520 --> 05:18:13,580
What the fuck?!

5776
05:18:13,580 --> 05:18:13,940
Okay.

5777
05:18:15,160 --> 05:18:16,240
I'm stoking!

5778
05:18:16,240 --> 05:18:17,400
That's

5779
05:18:21,650 --> 05:18:22,310
actually bullshit!

5780
05:18:24,610 --> 05:18:26,650
That's actually gotcha!

5781
05:18:30,530 --> 05:18:31,590
This is bullshit.

5782
05:18:32,010 --> 05:18:33,910
Oh my god, I'm literally guessing.

5783
05:18:35,290 --> 05:18:39,910
Bro, they aren't- oh my- It's more than two!

5784
05:18:40,270 --> 05:18:41,490
It's more than two!

5785
05:18:41,670 --> 05:18:43,890
That's actually- oh thank god he's slow.

5786
05:18:44,370 --> 05:18:45,410
Thank god he's slow.

5787
05:18:48,250 --> 05:18:54,090
How is a kid gonna- Oh my god, how is this kid gonna fucking function in society after this?

5788
05:18:54,630 --> 05:18:55,910
That's crazy.

5789
05:18:56,230 --> 05:18:58,970
We actually- actually, let's go gambling!

5790
05:19:01,690 --> 05:19:02,330
Okay.

5791
05:19:03,170 --> 05:19:03,810
Alright.

5792
05:19:07,650 --> 05:19:09,390
Next time you have to pull out a guitar.

5793
05:19:13,560 --> 05:19:15,180
Oh my god, bro.

5794
05:19:15,340 --> 05:19:16,060
Fuck you!

5795
05:19:16,060 --> 05:19:16,360
No!

5796
05:19:20,140 --> 05:19:21,380
Okay, what's this?

5797
05:19:22,500 --> 05:19:23,380
Oh no.

5798
05:19:24,560 --> 05:19:25,080
Okay.

5799
05:19:25,700 --> 05:19:26,860
Okay, at least it's one.

5800
05:19:27,020 --> 05:19:28,120
This guy gave me one.

5801
05:19:29,120 --> 05:19:30,100
Aw, dang it.

5802
05:19:31,580 --> 05:19:34,300
The worst part is that he takes three moves.

5803
05:19:34,740 --> 05:19:37,060
I think if I- Okay.

5804
05:19:38,260 --> 05:19:42,120
I think if I get the- the other expression, it'll take less moves.

5805
05:19:44,060 --> 05:19:46,080
But like, this is- this is not it.

5806
05:19:46,320 --> 05:19:48,620
This is- Oh my god, I got so lucky.

5807
05:19:48,740 --> 05:19:50,320
Oh yeah, I got so lucky, RNG.

5808
05:19:54,200 --> 05:19:56,340
It's teaching kids how to camp.

5809
05:19:57,040 --> 05:19:57,440
No!

5810
05:20:00,100 --> 05:20:01,980
What does this do?

5811
05:20:03,500 --> 05:20:04,160
Oh, okay.

5812
05:20:04,180 --> 05:20:05,380
I just have to do all of this.

5813
05:20:06,500 --> 05:20:07,680
Just gotta press all the buttons.

5814
05:20:11,500 --> 05:20:13,480
Okay, and then...

5815
05:20:13,480 --> 05:20:16,600
Assume like, if I do all the buttons, it'll open up.

5816
05:20:28,190 --> 05:20:28,830
Oh!

5817
05:20:30,110 --> 05:20:31,850
Wait, am I gonna see the giant?

5818
05:20:36,230 --> 05:20:37,750
Wait, do I go up?

5819
05:20:39,990 --> 05:20:41,170
It's kick time.

5820
05:20:41,930 --> 05:20:42,570
Kick.

5821
05:20:43,510 --> 05:20:46,250
It's time for my favorite job.

5822
05:20:48,210 --> 05:20:48,850
Kick.

5823
05:20:48,850 --> 05:20:48,990
Kick.

5824
05:20:52,410 --> 05:20:53,550
Kick.

5825
05:20:56,710 --> 05:20:58,690
It's all I have.

5826
05:20:59,730 --> 05:21:01,770
It's all I have.

5827
05:21:01,890 --> 05:21:02,470
Kick.

5828
05:21:03,750 --> 05:21:06,990
I need a hundred and twenty.

5829
05:21:08,330 --> 05:21:08,910
Kick.

5830
05:21:12,690 --> 05:21:15,390
Please, I need to feed my children.

5831
05:21:18,850 --> 05:21:23,850
My children, me, myself, and I, and dad too.

5832
05:21:25,170 --> 05:21:28,230
It named them all me in an afterthought.

5833
05:21:28,370 --> 05:21:30,670
Oh yeah, and also my dog.

5834
05:21:37,970 --> 05:21:39,890
Okay, we still need one more.

5835
05:21:40,050 --> 05:21:40,610
Is this tomato?

5836
05:21:40,750 --> 05:21:41,630
I fucking knew it.

5837
05:21:41,870 --> 05:21:46,850
That tomato looks- the tomatoes look very, very, like...

5838
05:21:46,850 --> 05:21:48,610
Like, they don't look too good.

5839
05:21:52,130 --> 05:21:53,750
No, I'm just...

5840
05:21:53,750 --> 05:21:55,790
I'm so tired of kicking.

5841
05:21:59,690 --> 05:22:03,230
They were not meant to kick for so long.

5842
05:22:03,830 --> 05:22:04,470
Kick.

5843
05:22:05,690 --> 05:22:06,270
Tree?

5844
05:22:06,510 --> 05:22:07,570
I'm missing one more.

5845
05:22:11,750 --> 05:22:13,110
The key?

5846
05:22:13,110 --> 05:22:14,310
The key?

5847
05:22:14,670 --> 05:22:16,550
How many more keys are there?

5848
05:22:16,690 --> 05:22:16,990
Kick.

5849
05:22:19,590 --> 05:22:20,730
What am I missing?

5850
05:22:20,850 --> 05:22:22,510
Like, that tomato looks red.

5851
05:22:23,150 --> 05:22:24,710
But then the other tomatoes...

5852
05:22:24,710 --> 05:22:27,130
Like, what happened to this tomato?

5853
05:22:28,010 --> 05:22:29,890
Oh, there's another box of tomatoes.

5854
05:22:30,150 --> 05:22:31,010
I fucking knew it.

5855
05:22:32,090 --> 05:22:32,590
Okay.

5856
05:22:35,630 --> 05:22:36,710
We did it.

5857
05:22:37,210 --> 05:22:38,790
We did it.

5858
05:22:40,270 --> 05:22:41,610
Alright, up we go.

5859
05:22:43,110 --> 05:22:44,330
We gotta climb up.

5860
05:22:44,470 --> 05:22:45,750
It's Jack and the Beanstalk.

5861
05:22:52,600 --> 05:22:54,840
It's Jack and the Beanstalk time.

5862
05:22:58,180 --> 05:22:59,700
What the fuck?

5863
05:23:00,520 --> 05:23:01,860
Where are we?

5864
05:23:02,880 --> 05:23:03,800
Oh no.

5865
05:23:03,960 --> 05:23:04,760
Oh no.

5866
05:23:04,900 --> 05:23:05,840
Where are we?

5867
05:23:10,340 --> 05:23:12,040
Oh no, not this one.

5868
05:23:12,140 --> 05:23:12,460
No.

5869
05:23:14,880 --> 05:23:15,520
No.

5870
05:23:16,240 --> 05:23:16,680
No.

5871
05:23:18,140 --> 05:23:19,540
I'm too stupid.

5872
05:23:22,400 --> 05:23:24,280
My mind can't comprehend.

5873
05:23:31,040 --> 05:23:32,740
No, I never made it to this level, guys.

5874
05:23:32,780 --> 05:23:33,480
I told you guys.

5875
05:23:33,920 --> 05:23:35,480
Oh no, not the upside down.

5876
05:23:36,080 --> 05:23:38,440
This is the first time I got the upside down.

5877
05:23:43,430 --> 05:23:44,930
I never made it this far.

5878
05:23:45,330 --> 05:23:47,430
The furthest I've ever gone to was...

5879
05:23:47,430 --> 05:23:50,550
was Owl's level.

5880
05:23:52,390 --> 05:23:53,710
How are we up in this?

5881
05:23:53,770 --> 05:23:55,810
Is this like Rabbit's Secret Stash?

5882
05:24:01,160 --> 05:24:02,620
Wait, can I not push this?

5883
05:24:05,060 --> 05:24:06,700
Okay, we push this.

5884
05:24:09,240 --> 05:24:10,520
Wait, where do we push?

5885
05:24:16,130 --> 05:24:16,690
Oh!

5886
05:24:18,910 --> 05:24:19,470
Okay.

5887
05:24:20,890 --> 05:24:22,550
Okay, it has to be empty.

5888
05:24:22,550 --> 05:24:24,890
Okay, I got it.

5889
05:24:32,430 --> 05:24:34,310
There has to be kickers here.

5890
05:24:35,570 --> 05:24:36,670
There has to be.

5891
05:24:37,270 --> 05:24:39,450
Are you telling me there's no cookies in the sky?

5892
05:24:41,390 --> 05:24:43,350
There's no cookies in the sky.

5893
05:24:44,390 --> 05:24:46,550
There's no cookies in the sky.

5894
05:24:47,370 --> 05:24:49,570
There's no cookies in the sky.

5895
05:24:49,570 --> 05:24:49,610
Why?

5896
05:24:54,650 --> 05:24:56,590
I can't believe it.

5897
05:24:57,190 --> 05:24:58,610
A world without cookies?

5898
05:24:58,950 --> 05:25:00,550
How could Rabbit do this to me?

5899
05:25:04,610 --> 05:25:05,770
How could he?

5900
05:25:06,990 --> 05:25:09,010
Okay, that needs a...

5901
05:25:09,010 --> 05:25:10,690
Where do I need the crank for?

5902
05:25:12,070 --> 05:25:14,350
Guys, which area needed the crank?

5903
05:25:21,990 --> 05:25:23,490
Was it the bridge?

5904
05:25:23,770 --> 05:25:25,450
I thought the bridge was the key.

5905
05:25:27,950 --> 05:25:30,910
I don't remember which area needed the crank.

5906
05:25:35,820 --> 05:25:37,460
Crank that soldier boy.

5907
05:25:41,320 --> 05:25:42,920
It's over there, Doki.

5908
05:25:43,140 --> 05:25:44,320
Just over there.

5909
05:25:46,760 --> 05:25:48,120
Was it the...

5910
05:25:49,100 --> 05:25:50,300
Tigger area?

5911
05:25:52,360 --> 05:25:53,900
Was it a cell forest?

5912
05:25:56,740 --> 05:25:58,080
I thought that needed a key.

5913
05:25:58,520 --> 05:25:59,720
I guess it needed a crank.

5914
05:26:01,900 --> 05:26:02,420
Okay.

5915
05:26:03,040 --> 05:26:04,300
Are you fucking all?

5916
05:26:04,860 --> 05:26:06,020
That's okay, I'm faster.

5917
05:26:07,600 --> 05:26:08,300
I can't.

5918
05:26:08,900 --> 05:26:09,820
I can't.

5919
05:26:09,880 --> 05:26:12,240
I can't deal with these guys.

5920
05:26:15,480 --> 05:26:20,260
That reminds me of that video from Half-Life of the guy editing... Crank that soldier.

5921
05:26:21,980 --> 05:26:23,280
Crank that soldier boy.

5922
05:26:23,500 --> 05:26:24,160
I did the soldier.

5923
05:26:24,160 --> 05:26:26,280
I recorded...

5924
05:26:28,000 --> 05:26:36,180
When we were there doing rehearsals in our 3D, we had time to do recordings and stuff for shorts and things.

5925
05:26:36,480 --> 05:26:41,460
I told you guys, it was during the off collab with Mint when we were talking about it.

5926
05:26:42,280 --> 05:26:45,680
We were like, oh we have time, let's just record some stuff for shorts.

5927
05:26:46,060 --> 05:26:49,000
For me, I did soldier boy.

5928
05:26:50,760 --> 05:26:51,680
Plus other...

5929
05:26:51,680 --> 05:26:53,640
I did like dumb meme dances.

5930
05:26:55,240 --> 05:26:56,740
Mint did like actual dances.

5931
05:26:57,060 --> 05:26:59,080
I was like, Crank that soldier boy.

5932
05:26:59,240 --> 05:27:00,840
And Superman.

5933
05:27:16,030 --> 05:27:19,870
I don't want any less from you.

5934
05:27:20,470 --> 05:27:23,530
I won't tell you guys about the other dances, but I'll just let you guys know.

5935
05:27:23,770 --> 05:27:26,970
Because I already talked about it in the off collab with Mint.

5936
05:27:27,570 --> 05:27:30,230
I did soldier boy.

5937
05:27:35,290 --> 05:27:37,110
I'm cranking it.

5938
05:27:37,570 --> 05:27:38,310
Guys.

5939
05:27:38,870 --> 05:27:40,690
I gotta crank that soldier boy.

5940
05:27:40,930 --> 05:27:41,810
I gotta represent.

5941
05:27:45,730 --> 05:27:46,490
What?

5942
05:27:47,250 --> 05:27:48,850
What is that sound?

5943
05:27:49,010 --> 05:27:50,130
Is that a new enemy?

5944
05:27:50,510 --> 05:27:52,450
Oh fuck no, it's Gamba.

5945
05:27:53,550 --> 05:27:55,250
It's fucking Gamba.

5946
05:27:58,350 --> 05:28:00,290
Oh no, that's not what I wanted.

5947
05:28:04,780 --> 05:28:05,280
Okay.

5948
05:28:07,000 --> 05:28:09,960
No, get the Gamba out of here.

5949
05:28:11,840 --> 05:28:15,080
I think the worst part is that I have to do the arrows as well.

5950
05:28:19,880 --> 05:28:22,680
Yeah, by the way, Mint and I are gonna do a concert.

5951
05:28:27,640 --> 05:28:28,560
Oh no.

5952
05:28:30,600 --> 05:28:34,440
It's like almost- Oh my god, he's next to me.

5953
05:28:40,540 --> 05:28:43,640
It's like, we've been like three weeks I think.

5954
05:28:45,780 --> 05:28:46,080
Yeah.

5955
05:28:48,660 --> 05:28:51,320
Stop laughing at me, it makes me sad.

5956
05:28:55,080 --> 05:28:56,740
Wait, is he actually slow?

5957
05:28:56,740 --> 05:28:58,400
Okay, I'm gonna skip this guy.

5958
05:28:58,500 --> 05:28:59,420
No, fuck this guy.

5959
05:29:00,560 --> 05:29:04,840
The only reason why I wanna do it is just for the cookies, so I have time for cookies.

5960
05:29:07,060 --> 05:29:16,500
I don't like feeling pressured in my hunt for- in my quest to not get my- not get myself beat up by the cookie mafia.

5961
05:29:18,040 --> 05:29:19,840
You don't wanna piss off cookie monster.

5962
05:29:22,700 --> 05:29:24,000
He's seen things.

5963
05:29:27,020 --> 05:29:28,680
He's seen stuff.

5964
05:29:29,520 --> 05:29:31,920
Oh my god, get away from me!

5965
05:29:32,940 --> 05:29:33,700
No!

5966
05:29:40,240 --> 05:29:41,760
Oh no.

5967
05:29:42,800 --> 05:29:46,500
No, he laughed at me and I got sad.

5968
05:29:49,380 --> 05:29:51,540
He's done things.

5969
05:29:53,920 --> 05:29:54,240
Quick.

5970
05:29:57,400 --> 05:29:58,700
No, I'm sad.

5971
05:29:59,520 --> 05:30:00,240
What's this?

5972
05:30:01,220 --> 05:30:02,080
Oh, it's a key.

5973
05:30:03,340 --> 05:30:04,880
Oh, it's for the barn.

5974
05:30:06,440 --> 05:30:08,740
Okay, I'm gonna fucking spend my cookies too.

5975
05:30:10,180 --> 05:30:11,540
Why do I still have the shovel?

5976
05:30:11,600 --> 05:30:14,800
I have picked up the shovel and I still have not used the shovel.

5977
05:30:15,000 --> 05:30:16,080
Like, what was the point?

5978
05:30:18,520 --> 05:30:20,580
There's like one more area that I need to kick.

5979
05:30:20,660 --> 05:30:22,340
That's it, I'm getting you out of this game.

5980
05:30:30,990 --> 05:30:32,110
Stop!

5981
05:30:32,530 --> 05:30:34,890
Stop laughing at me!

5982
05:30:37,790 --> 05:30:38,910
Stop!

5983
05:30:40,250 --> 05:30:43,710
I just wanna go gambling.

5984
05:30:43,970 --> 05:30:45,470
What is this RNG?

5985
05:30:47,850 --> 05:30:48,410
Okay.

5986
05:30:49,810 --> 05:30:54,010
Oh, let me out.

5987
05:30:54,170 --> 05:30:56,210
Let me out.

5988
05:30:56,210 --> 05:30:56,490
No.

5989
05:31:00,190 --> 05:31:01,350
Stop!

5990
05:31:05,090 --> 05:31:05,830
Stop!

5991
05:31:07,870 --> 05:31:10,350
I had a spooky laugh.

5992
05:31:14,510 --> 05:31:16,250
I can't.

5993
05:31:16,830 --> 05:31:18,070
No, I can't.

5994
05:31:18,130 --> 05:31:19,710
Get away from me!

5995
05:31:20,570 --> 05:31:21,510
Get away!

5996
05:31:22,290 --> 05:31:23,610
Get fucking free!

5997
05:31:24,710 --> 05:31:26,810
Oh my god!

5998
05:31:27,370 --> 05:31:28,410
He's a freak!

5999
05:31:31,510 --> 05:31:34,870
Now it's a horror game.

6000
05:31:38,550 --> 05:31:40,910
Told you he's a freak.

6001
05:31:46,730 --> 05:31:47,750
Alright,

6002
05:31:51,610 --> 05:31:52,230
we got him.

6003
05:31:55,290 --> 05:31:57,690
Oh my god, the freak is dead.

6004
05:32:02,970 --> 05:32:05,390
Where could the last...

6005
05:32:06,370 --> 05:32:08,910
I didn't grab all the cookies in this level.

6006
05:32:09,910 --> 05:32:11,810
There's a missing cookie here.

6007
05:32:15,260 --> 05:32:16,960
What could give a cookie?

6008
05:32:18,180 --> 05:32:20,040
I already kicked that area.

6009
05:32:20,320 --> 05:32:21,040
Is it this?

6010
05:32:21,240 --> 05:32:21,560
No.

6011
05:32:24,200 --> 05:32:26,540
Where could the last cookie be?

6012
05:32:28,220 --> 05:32:29,560
I hate this.

6013
05:32:30,160 --> 05:32:31,480
I hate hunting for cookies.

6014
05:32:36,640 --> 05:32:38,760
Please, one cookie.

6015
05:32:39,180 --> 05:32:42,580
I know I'm missing a cookie stash somewhere.

6016
05:32:44,680 --> 05:32:45,820
Where is it?

6017
05:32:45,860 --> 05:32:47,540
Where are you hiding the stash?

6018
05:32:49,060 --> 05:32:50,460
Wait, I can use...

6019
05:32:55,760 --> 05:32:59,060
Wait, I actually can use the shovel?

6020
05:33:00,640 --> 05:33:01,660
There's no way.

6021
05:33:07,360 --> 05:33:08,360
By the river?

6022
05:33:11,200 --> 05:33:11,680
Where?

6023
05:33:14,940 --> 05:33:16,140
No, there's no way.

6024
05:33:16,320 --> 05:33:17,440
You guys are fucking with me.

6025
05:33:17,500 --> 05:33:18,900
There's no fucking way.

6026
05:33:20,880 --> 05:33:22,040
There's no way.

6027
05:33:22,360 --> 05:33:23,140
Oh my god.

6028
05:33:23,140 --> 05:33:24,380
You guys are fucking with me.

6029
05:33:24,420 --> 05:33:25,200
There's no way.

6030
05:33:26,360 --> 05:33:27,480
There's no way.

6031
05:33:29,900 --> 05:33:30,740
I knew it.

6032
05:33:30,840 --> 05:33:31,780
You guys were... Oh my god.

6033
05:33:31,800 --> 05:33:33,160
You guys trolled me so hard.

6034
05:33:33,700 --> 05:33:35,340
I just... I give up.

6035
05:33:35,420 --> 05:33:36,520
It's just one stash.

6036
05:33:36,960 --> 05:33:38,280
It's just one stash.

6037
05:33:38,340 --> 05:33:40,660
It's not gonna affect my entire game.

6038
05:33:43,280 --> 05:33:44,320
There is?

6039
05:33:46,120 --> 05:33:46,980
Think near the...

6040
05:33:46,980 --> 05:33:47,880
There's no way.

6041
05:33:48,620 --> 05:33:49,580
Which rock?

6042
05:33:57,240 --> 05:33:58,280
There's no way.

6043
05:33:58,720 --> 05:33:59,180
There's no way.

6044
05:33:59,180 --> 05:34:00,160
No, you're fucking with me.

6045
05:34:00,380 --> 05:34:01,340
There's no way.

6046
05:34:06,040 --> 05:34:07,020
There's no way.

6047
05:34:07,640 --> 05:34:08,180
I knew it.

6048
05:34:08,180 --> 05:34:09,620
I knew you guys were...

6049
05:34:09,620 --> 05:34:10,520
I knew it.

6050
05:34:11,640 --> 05:34:12,620
I knew it.

6051
05:34:13,940 --> 05:34:14,680
I knew it.

6052
05:34:14,780 --> 05:34:15,000
I knew it.

6053
05:34:15,040 --> 05:34:16,660
You guys are just making me so paranoid.

6054
05:34:16,860 --> 05:34:18,100
I fucking knew there was nothing.

6055
05:34:18,640 --> 05:34:18,920
I...

6056
05:34:20,340 --> 05:34:21,780
I knew it.

6057
05:34:21,840 --> 05:34:23,420
I knew there was nothing here.

6058
05:34:23,620 --> 05:34:25,280
I knew it.

6059
05:34:25,280 --> 05:34:26,540
It's just...

6060
05:34:26,540 --> 05:34:27,640
I don't care.

6061
05:34:31,100 --> 05:34:32,940
It's just one area.

6062
05:34:34,120 --> 05:34:35,380
It's just...

6063
05:34:35,380 --> 05:34:36,880
It's just one area.

6064
05:34:37,140 --> 05:34:38,300
There's... Oh my god.

6065
05:34:38,380 --> 05:34:39,500
It doesn't matter.

6066
05:34:39,700 --> 05:34:40,880
It doesn't matter.

6067
05:34:42,060 --> 05:34:42,800
I'm gonna buy...

6068
05:34:42,800 --> 05:34:44,880
I'm gonna buy the...

6069
05:34:44,880 --> 05:34:46,920
I'm gonna buy the...

6070
05:34:46,920 --> 05:34:47,380
I'm gonna buy the face.

6071
05:34:47,580 --> 05:34:50,980
I might be a little stronger if I buy that extra face.

6072
05:34:54,650 --> 05:34:55,610
I need...

6073
05:34:55,610 --> 05:34:57,790
Christopher Robin, where's the...

6074
05:34:57,790 --> 05:34:59,910
Christopher Robin, cheer me up.

6075
05:34:59,970 --> 05:35:01,890
Tell me to not be sad anymore.

6076
05:35:02,570 --> 05:35:03,710
Thank you, Robin.

6077
05:35:04,670 --> 05:35:07,890
I really appreciate you telling me not to be sad anymore.

6078
05:35:09,230 --> 05:35:12,210
Okay, we gotta buy the...

6079
05:35:12,210 --> 05:35:13,750
The face.

6080
05:35:13,750 --> 05:35:13,890
The face.

6081
05:35:15,490 --> 05:35:17,050
Where was the face again?

6082
05:35:17,330 --> 05:35:19,490
It was in the cog room, but...

6083
05:35:19,490 --> 05:35:21,170
Was it in the bird room?

6084
05:35:22,790 --> 05:35:24,450
I think it was, right?

6085
05:35:27,950 --> 05:35:29,750
Thank you, Christopher Robin.

6086
05:35:29,990 --> 05:35:31,390
So inspirational.

6087
05:35:32,610 --> 05:35:34,030
That was so inspirational.

6088
05:35:34,410 --> 05:35:36,110
I really appreciate it.

6089
05:35:42,980 --> 05:35:45,420
I should be faster than these guys.

6090
05:35:47,700 --> 05:35:48,640
There we go.

6091
05:35:49,780 --> 05:35:50,440
It's okay.

6092
05:35:50,820 --> 05:35:52,360
Leave me alone.

6093
05:35:52,660 --> 05:35:53,720
Leave me alone.

6094
05:35:55,300 --> 05:35:56,700
Zonerman, thank you for the super chat.

6095
05:35:56,800 --> 05:35:57,900
Thank you, thank you.

6096
05:35:59,220 --> 05:36:08,620
Moments like this are why it's good to be a masochist in Doki's chat when she's afraid and she starts calling the monster a freak.

6097
05:36:09,000 --> 05:36:10,260
Thank you for the super chat.

6098
05:36:10,360 --> 05:36:11,620
Thank you, thank you.

6099
05:36:11,620 --> 05:36:15,480
I don't know if I read your super chat, but thank you for the super chat.

6100
05:36:15,500 --> 05:36:16,320
Thank you, thank you.

6101
05:36:16,400 --> 05:36:17,480
Can't wait for the concert.

6102
05:36:17,640 --> 05:36:18,600
I'll see you guys later.

6103
05:36:19,220 --> 05:36:20,020
Gotta go.

6104
05:36:20,140 --> 05:36:21,300
Thank you.

6105
05:36:21,680 --> 05:36:25,660
I hope you guys like the concert.

6106
05:36:25,900 --> 05:36:26,640
I really do.

6107
05:36:27,240 --> 05:36:28,780
We're working really hard for it.

6108
05:36:28,840 --> 05:36:29,580
Oh my god, no!

6109
05:36:35,340 --> 05:36:35,900
Yes,

6110
05:36:40,320 --> 05:36:41,980
I don't want to do a part two.

6111
05:36:42,520 --> 05:36:46,480
I just want to finish it all and let go.

6112
05:36:46,820 --> 05:36:48,300
I have too many series.

6113
05:36:49,120 --> 05:36:51,680
I still didn't finish Silent Hill.

6114
05:36:55,180 --> 05:36:57,540
It should be with the bird.

6115
05:36:57,540 --> 05:36:58,560
I think.

6116
05:36:59,320 --> 05:36:59,420
Right?

6117
05:37:00,800 --> 05:37:02,440
The bird area.

6118
05:37:10,720 --> 05:37:13,400
I have Rabbit and Tigger.

6119
05:37:13,440 --> 05:37:15,980
Maybe Tigger's level is really, really short.

6120
05:37:16,100 --> 05:37:17,360
You guys don't know that.

6121
05:37:18,100 --> 05:37:21,940
Like, I'm pretty sure it could be really, really short, guys.

6122
05:37:23,120 --> 05:37:24,660
No, I didn't learn the face!

6123
05:37:24,780 --> 05:37:25,020
No!

6124
05:37:27,580 --> 05:37:29,080
I'll never know.

6125
05:37:29,700 --> 05:37:32,020
I didn't see the face.

6126
05:37:33,280 --> 05:37:33,960
I'll never know.

6127
05:37:33,960 --> 05:37:33,980
I'll never know.

6128
05:37:33,980 --> 05:37:37,120
Oh, I bet it was very scary.

6129
05:37:40,540 --> 05:37:44,100
I bet it was so scary.

6130
05:37:51,530 --> 05:37:52,030
Okay.

6131
05:37:53,230 --> 05:37:54,510
I'll go this way.

6132
05:37:58,400 --> 05:37:58,900
Okay.

6133
05:38:00,060 --> 05:38:03,040
It says the longest- Oh, thank god, this is the longest level.

6134
05:38:03,120 --> 05:38:03,960
I fucking knew it.

6135
05:38:07,620 --> 05:38:10,160
Okay, I'll go this way and then into the barn.

6136
05:38:10,160 --> 05:38:14,080
Of course, Rabbit has the most fucking worries here.

6137
05:38:18,500 --> 05:38:19,300
Alright.

6138
05:38:19,800 --> 05:38:20,660
Open the door.

6139
05:38:25,780 --> 05:38:26,580
Alright.

6140
05:38:26,780 --> 05:38:27,720
Door open.

6141
05:38:29,740 --> 05:38:31,080
Okay, door open.

6142
05:38:31,380 --> 05:38:31,820
I'm sorry.

6143
05:38:32,260 --> 05:38:33,640
Door open now.

6144
05:38:35,340 --> 05:38:39,140
You can't just interact and the door just magically opens.

6145
05:38:39,640 --> 05:38:41,780
I gotta fucking take my hand out.

6146
05:38:47,760 --> 05:38:48,560
Okay.

6147
05:38:48,560 --> 05:38:49,840
Okay, we're almost there.

6148
05:38:50,640 --> 05:38:51,700
Almost finished with Rabbit.

6149
05:38:53,240 --> 05:38:55,560
And then everybody will love me again.

6150
05:38:55,620 --> 05:38:56,300
Oh, okay.

6151
05:38:56,440 --> 05:38:57,020
Oh, fuck.

6152
05:38:57,120 --> 05:38:58,360
Okay, I have to fight these guys.

6153
05:38:58,720 --> 05:39:00,260
Alright, maybe we'll see our new move.

6154
05:39:02,280 --> 05:39:04,060
What the fu- Okay, this has to be.

6155
05:39:04,820 --> 05:39:07,220
What the fu- Okay.

6156
05:39:10,400 --> 05:39:10,880
Okay.

6157
05:39:11,420 --> 05:39:12,700
Alright, Piglet.

6158
05:39:14,260 --> 05:39:14,740
What?

6159
05:39:19,760 --> 05:39:20,640
Okay.

6160
05:39:21,820 --> 05:39:22,700
Alright.

6161
05:39:24,820 --> 05:39:26,040
Oh my god.

6162
05:39:26,080 --> 05:39:27,280
Oh my god, I can use the shovel!

6163
05:39:29,220 --> 05:39:30,680
It's time!

6164
05:39:31,140 --> 05:39:32,640
I got rocks!

6165
05:39:33,140 --> 05:39:33,580
Wow!

6166
05:39:34,100 --> 05:39:34,520
I got

6167
05:39:37,610 --> 05:39:40,030
- I did it!

6168
05:39:40,150 --> 05:39:44,210
We used the fucking stupid fucking shovel.

6169
05:39:47,750 --> 05:39:49,210
We did it.

6170
05:39:50,190 --> 05:39:51,390
We did it.

6171
05:39:51,430 --> 05:39:53,270
No, no, no, no, no.

6172
05:39:53,770 --> 05:39:54,950
Okay, we turn this on.

6173
05:39:58,930 --> 05:40:00,230
Oh my god.

6174
05:40:00,610 --> 05:40:04,310
We've been holding that shovel since the beginning of this level.

6175
05:40:04,910 --> 05:40:07,490
This godforsaken- Oh, cookies.

6176
05:40:10,130 --> 05:40:13,870
I get angry, but I see cookies and now I'm happy.

6177
05:40:16,030 --> 05:40:17,690
It's just that easy.

6178
05:40:17,690 --> 05:40:19,470
Oh, cookies.

6179
05:40:20,070 --> 05:40:22,810
Now I'm not angry anymore.

6180
05:40:28,610 --> 05:40:29,330
Alright,

6181
05:40:32,430 --> 05:40:32,790
nice.

6182
05:40:33,070 --> 05:40:36,310
Okay, so we're still missing- Oh no, is he blocking?

6183
05:40:37,530 --> 05:40:41,350
Is he blocking the last cookie area?

6184
05:40:41,730 --> 05:40:42,850
Is it him?

6185
05:40:43,550 --> 05:40:45,790
No, I just missed one here.

6186
05:40:45,790 --> 05:40:50,310
No, I- I missed a lot more than one apparently.

6187
05:40:51,010 --> 05:40:52,210
Maybe it's this?

6188
05:40:54,370 --> 05:40:57,550
No, no, please Mr. Elephant, please.

6189
05:40:58,690 --> 05:41:01,570
Please, Mr. Elephant, please.

6190
05:41:04,630 --> 05:41:06,750
Mr. Elephant, sir.

6191
05:41:08,870 --> 05:41:10,530
Me have my cookie!

6192
05:41:15,790 --> 05:41:16,450
Oh, nice.

6193
05:41:17,590 --> 05:41:18,130
Oh!

6194
05:41:19,950 --> 05:41:20,910
Where's the exit?

6195
05:41:23,150 --> 05:41:26,090
Please, Elephant, I don't know where the exit is!

6196
05:41:28,010 --> 05:41:29,230
Where is it?

6197
05:41:29,470 --> 05:41:30,790
Oh, it must be over here.

6198
05:41:32,330 --> 05:41:32,670
Right?

6199
05:41:33,350 --> 05:41:34,670
Oh, there it is, there it is.

6200
05:41:39,680 --> 05:41:41,240
A hundred left.

6201
05:41:42,040 --> 05:41:43,340
We just need a hundred.

6202
05:41:44,320 --> 05:41:45,320
And then we're free.

6203
05:41:46,020 --> 05:41:48,080
We're free from the cookie mafia.

6204
05:41:48,820 --> 05:41:50,600
He'll hurt me no more.

6205
05:41:53,160 --> 05:41:55,400
He can't hurt me no more.

6206
05:41:57,040 --> 05:41:59,700
Tinker has twelve rooms?!

6207
05:41:59,700 --> 05:42:00,620
Oh my god.

6208
05:42:00,980 --> 05:42:05,080
What are you- What's wrong with you?

6209
05:42:07,340 --> 05:42:07,980
Oh.

6210
05:42:18,600 --> 05:42:20,380
We did it, rabbit!

6211
05:42:25,560 --> 05:42:26,200
Okay.

6212
05:42:31,400 --> 05:42:32,040
Okay.

6213
05:42:32,920 --> 05:42:33,800
Wait, what gate?

6214
05:42:33,820 --> 05:42:34,580
Oh, this gate?

6215
05:42:38,820 --> 05:42:40,060
I got you.

6216
05:42:50,900 --> 05:42:51,580
Oh.

6217
05:42:52,820 --> 05:42:55,360
Okay, you could've been more specific, rabbit.

6218
05:42:55,700 --> 05:42:57,220
This is not on me.

6219
05:42:57,320 --> 05:42:58,960
You literally said push it.

6220
05:43:00,200 --> 05:43:01,180
Alright, I push.

6221
05:43:04,700 --> 05:43:06,020
Wow, wow!

6222
05:43:06,380 --> 05:43:07,120
I saw that!

6223
05:43:07,200 --> 05:43:08,160
That was passive aggressive.

6224
05:43:09,280 --> 05:43:11,180
I fucking saw that.

6225
05:43:12,460 --> 05:43:13,800
Rabbit, wrong lever.

6226
05:43:13,920 --> 05:43:15,600
Literally, he pointed it to me.

6227
05:43:16,400 --> 05:43:17,540
Ali, thank you for the super chat.

6228
05:43:17,620 --> 05:43:18,260
Thank you, thank you.

6229
05:43:18,380 --> 05:43:20,280
Pooh's stream was so short and easy.

6230
05:43:20,500 --> 05:43:22,240
How did it end up like this?

6231
05:43:22,780 --> 05:43:26,620
Pooh's only worry is that he doesn't get honey and starve.

6232
05:43:28,300 --> 05:43:30,800
Rabbit's worry is that he'll just starve.

6233
05:43:31,140 --> 05:43:33,660
But like, more stressed out because he's an adult.

6234
05:43:34,520 --> 05:43:36,540
Oh, so that's what all the logs was for.

6235
05:43:37,400 --> 05:43:38,140
Oh no.

6236
05:43:38,140 --> 05:43:38,600
No!

6237
05:43:39,220 --> 05:43:41,400
I don't wanna fight you!

6238
05:43:42,660 --> 05:43:43,700
Also, are you welcome?

6239
05:43:43,880 --> 05:43:44,340
Oh no.

6240
05:43:45,220 --> 05:43:46,600
Are you welcome to tomato farm?

6241
05:43:46,700 --> 05:43:47,520
Welcome, welcome.

6242
05:43:53,980 --> 05:43:55,260
I fucked up.

6243
05:43:55,420 --> 05:43:56,880
This has to be two tries, right?

6244
05:43:59,740 --> 05:44:00,580
Oh nice.

6245
05:44:00,720 --> 05:44:01,800
Okay, now he's just two.

6246
05:44:02,160 --> 05:44:03,500
Because I got stronger.

6247
05:44:06,660 --> 05:44:07,780
Okay, push.

6248
05:44:08,340 --> 05:44:09,660
I did it, rabbit!

6249
05:44:09,720 --> 05:44:10,620
Are you proud of me?

6250
05:44:11,760 --> 05:44:12,980
Okay, he's not yet.

6251
05:44:13,080 --> 05:44:13,720
He's not looking.

6252
05:44:14,060 --> 05:44:14,660
Rabbit, rabbit!

6253
05:44:14,820 --> 05:44:15,480
Look, look!

6254
05:44:16,060 --> 05:44:16,720
Look, rabbit!

6255
05:44:22,620 --> 05:44:26,540
Oh, that felt very Asian.

6256
05:44:31,220 --> 05:44:32,180
That felt...

6257
05:44:32,180 --> 05:44:34,120
Guys, I don't think he's...

6258
05:44:34,120 --> 05:44:34,340
No.

6259
05:44:41,000 --> 05:44:43,540
My mom's not proud of me, guys.

6260
05:44:43,780 --> 05:44:45,440
It wasn't an A+.

6261
05:44:48,360 --> 05:44:50,020
Mom, I got an A!

6262
05:44:50,260 --> 05:44:51,100
Mom, look!

6263
05:44:56,440 --> 05:44:57,840
Why are you tricking me?

6264
05:44:57,940 --> 05:44:58,900
Why don't you do it?

6265
05:45:01,160 --> 05:45:02,210
That's so ungrateful.

6266
05:45:02,210 --> 05:45:02,810
That's so ungrateful.

6267
05:45:03,730 --> 05:45:05,210
Rabbit, you're so good at it.

6268
05:45:05,250 --> 05:45:06,350
You do the thing.

6269
05:45:09,950 --> 05:45:11,630
Wings, thank you for the super chat!

6270
05:45:11,770 --> 05:45:12,570
Thank you, thank you!

6271
05:45:12,750 --> 05:45:15,710
Oh my god, blonde lady streaming piglet?

6272
05:45:15,870 --> 05:45:17,430
I'm too silver for this.

6273
05:45:17,530 --> 05:45:18,310
Thank you for the super chat.

6274
05:45:18,490 --> 05:45:19,410
Thank you, thank you.

6275
05:45:23,250 --> 05:45:25,350
I can't even kick for cookies.

6276
05:45:25,730 --> 05:45:26,930
I kicked for cookies.

6277
05:45:27,330 --> 05:45:29,370
I already finished all these cookies.

6278
05:45:37,230 --> 05:45:40,250
I already finished all these cookies.

6279
05:45:50,730 --> 05:45:53,650
Oh, fucking yeah, the five other times I did it for you!

6280
05:45:55,510 --> 05:45:56,870
Don't worry, rabbit!

6281
05:45:58,070 --> 05:45:59,530
I'm doing it!

6282
05:46:00,770 --> 05:46:01,630
For free!

6283
05:46:01,690 --> 05:46:02,110
In your dream.

6284
05:46:02,170 --> 05:46:03,350
It's not even a real life.

6285
05:46:03,770 --> 05:46:04,810
It's not even real life.

6286
05:46:04,810 --> 05:46:06,190
Even in a dream, you're an asshole.

6287
05:46:07,430 --> 05:46:08,710
Just remember that.

6288
05:46:09,170 --> 05:46:10,830
Even in a dream, you're unlikable.

6289
05:46:21,200 --> 05:46:23,780
All he's good for is providing honey for Pooh Bear.

6290
05:46:24,000 --> 05:46:25,060
That's right, I said it.

6291
05:46:25,860 --> 05:46:27,760
He adds no value to the story.

6292
05:46:30,480 --> 05:46:32,860
Rabbit is nobody's favorite character.

6293
05:46:47,330 --> 05:46:48,110
Piglet, please!

6294
05:46:48,810 --> 05:46:51,130
You must help me out of this cart!

6295
05:46:51,370 --> 05:46:52,090
Oh, yeah?

6296
05:46:54,930 --> 05:46:57,090
Oh my god, so demanding.

6297
05:47:00,050 --> 05:47:01,250
I like rabbit.

6298
05:47:05,210 --> 05:47:06,930
What do you like about him?

6299
05:47:10,010 --> 05:47:10,910
I don't even know.

6300
05:47:11,050 --> 05:47:12,450
What do you like about him?

6301
05:47:18,770 --> 05:47:20,470
It's pity.

6302
05:47:22,210 --> 05:47:25,040
It's pity.

6303
05:47:25,040 --> 05:47:27,130
He keeps it real.

6304
05:47:40,300 --> 05:47:45,850
Rabbit is like Charisma Blackhole.

6305
05:47:47,850 --> 05:47:51,870
His entire purpose in winning the Pooh is to provide Winnie honey.

6306
05:47:52,190 --> 05:47:53,370
So he doesn't starve.

6307
05:47:53,750 --> 05:48:05,330
If we take away rabbit, there's no logical reason for Pooh Bear to even be alive.

6308
05:48:06,170 --> 05:48:08,510
Because who's going to fucking feed him?

6309
05:48:13,450 --> 05:48:14,850
30 cookies?!

6310
05:48:14,850 --> 05:48:15,830
I don't know.

6311
05:48:15,830 --> 05:48:16,430
I don't care anymore.

6312
05:48:19,510 --> 05:48:21,590
I'm not going to go back that far.

6313
05:48:21,670 --> 05:48:23,830
How did I miss 30 fucking cookies?

6314
05:48:30,980 --> 05:48:32,500
There's no second though.

6315
05:48:33,420 --> 05:48:34,680
There's only one Tigger.

6316
05:48:38,890 --> 05:48:40,790
Thank you for the super chat.

6317
05:48:40,870 --> 05:48:41,730
Thank you.

6318
05:48:42,670 --> 05:48:45,350
People like Eeyore more than rabbit.

6319
05:48:52,610 --> 05:48:53,730
Are you?

6320
05:48:53,890 --> 05:48:54,370
Oh wait.

6321
05:48:54,630 --> 05:48:56,550
I know why you're in this stream.

6322
05:49:13,520 --> 05:49:15,620
No, you're not special now.

6323
05:49:17,100 --> 05:49:19,320
Time to buy a new Tigger plushie.

6324
05:49:21,560 --> 05:49:22,980
He looks like Cheeto.

6325
05:49:24,360 --> 05:49:25,560
That's what I'm saying.

6326
05:49:25,620 --> 05:49:26,860
He's not unique anymore.

6327
05:49:27,000 --> 05:49:28,260
He just looks like Cheeto.

6328
05:49:28,600 --> 05:49:30,040
The fuck is this angle?

6329
05:49:31,480 --> 05:49:32,160
Cookies.

6330
05:49:34,460 --> 05:49:34,920
Alas.

6331
05:49:35,520 --> 05:49:36,740
Guys, it's almost over.

6332
05:49:37,800 --> 05:49:40,100
We almost farmed all the cookies.

6333
05:49:41,000 --> 05:49:44,140
We have one last scary face to buy.

6334
05:49:48,550 --> 05:49:49,850
There's no way.

6335
05:49:49,850 --> 05:49:51,070
It has to...

6336
05:49:51,070 --> 05:49:53,510
Oh my god, I swear if it tells me to buy two faces.

6337
05:49:53,690 --> 05:49:55,030
I swear to god, I'm gonna...

6338
05:49:55,030 --> 05:49:57,690
I swear, I'm gonna fucking...

6339
05:50:01,650 --> 05:50:02,990
Thank you for the super chat.

6340
05:50:03,090 --> 05:50:03,290
Thank you.

6341
05:50:03,590 --> 05:50:05,130
We're 1000 Acre Woods, guys.

6342
05:50:05,230 --> 05:50:08,090
Of course, we kick everything we see for cookies.

6343
05:50:09,910 --> 05:50:11,050
Thank you for the super chat.

6344
05:50:11,290 --> 05:50:12,050
Thank you.

6345
05:50:12,110 --> 05:50:13,110
Soon we'll be free.

6346
05:50:13,650 --> 05:50:15,930
Soon I'll pay up my debt from the cookie mafia.

6347
05:50:16,530 --> 05:50:18,230
And then I'm gonna...

6348
05:50:18,230 --> 05:50:20,650
And then I'm gonna be free.

6349
05:50:21,390 --> 05:50:22,950
Mr. Cookie...

6350
05:50:22,950 --> 05:50:24,250
Mr. Cookie Monster.

6351
05:50:25,810 --> 05:50:27,050
Leave me be.

6352
05:50:28,130 --> 05:50:32,470
As we all know, if you pay off your debts, you can leave, right?

6353
05:50:33,030 --> 05:50:33,630
Right?

6354
05:50:33,850 --> 05:50:35,030
That's how it goes.

6355
05:50:35,930 --> 05:50:36,430
Oh no.

6356
05:50:36,930 --> 05:50:38,430
No, not Gamba Man.

6357
05:50:38,710 --> 05:50:39,810
Gamba Man, no!

6358
05:50:40,390 --> 05:50:41,770
Gamba Man, no!

6359
05:50:42,910 --> 05:50:43,950
Gamba Man!

6360
05:50:45,150 --> 05:50:47,030
Gamba Man, leave me alone!

6361
05:50:47,210 --> 05:50:47,630
Please!

6362
05:50:58,190 --> 05:50:58,710
Okay.

6363
05:51:01,770 --> 05:51:03,970
Yeah, we leave after the last job, right?

6364
05:51:04,010 --> 05:51:05,450
That's how it works, right?

6365
05:51:08,850 --> 05:51:09,590
Oh no.

6366
05:51:11,010 --> 05:51:12,590
Oh no, okay.

6367
05:51:12,830 --> 05:51:13,790
Is that it?

6368
05:51:14,210 --> 05:51:14,770
Is it two?

6369
05:51:16,070 --> 05:51:18,590
Oh, thank god, it's two.

6370
05:51:20,450 --> 05:51:20,930
Okay.

6371
05:51:22,610 --> 05:51:23,050
Cookie!

6372
05:51:26,910 --> 05:51:29,050
Oh my god, I hope it's just one face.

6373
05:51:29,710 --> 05:51:30,570
Oh, please.

6374
05:51:31,090 --> 05:51:32,330
Please just be one.

6375
05:51:32,590 --> 05:51:34,350
Oh, no, no, no.

6376
05:51:34,390 --> 05:51:35,090
No, Big Man.

6377
05:51:35,590 --> 05:51:36,950
No, Big Man, no.

6378
05:51:36,950 --> 05:51:38,890
Don't, Big Man, leave me alone.

6379
05:51:39,730 --> 05:51:40,330
Please.

6380
05:51:41,690 --> 05:51:42,290
No.

6381
05:51:43,790 --> 05:51:46,350
Please, I'm just a little pig.

6382
05:51:47,250 --> 05:51:47,950
I can't.

6383
05:51:54,010 --> 05:51:55,970
Devlin, thank you for the super chat.

6384
05:51:56,190 --> 05:51:57,570
Thank you, thank you.

6385
05:51:57,970 --> 05:51:59,710
Tigger, losing his stripes?

6386
05:52:00,610 --> 05:52:04,150
Besides fear of losing his rank, he had it worse since stripes signify rank.

6387
05:52:05,250 --> 05:52:08,630
It just reminded his time in the Great Tigger War.

6388
05:52:10,010 --> 05:52:12,630
Without the stripes, he just...

6389
05:52:13,190 --> 05:52:16,290
He thinks it just means it was never worth it.

6390
05:52:17,770 --> 05:52:23,530
Everything he did in the Great Tigger War never mattered and he doesn't want to think about that.

6391
05:52:27,100 --> 05:52:28,360
That's right, fight me!

6392
05:52:28,920 --> 05:52:29,700
Fight me!

6393
05:52:37,800 --> 05:52:39,280
Fudge, thank you for the super chat.

6394
05:52:39,400 --> 05:52:40,220
Thank you, thank you.

6395
05:52:40,220 --> 05:52:40,580
Wait, what?

6396
05:52:41,500 --> 05:52:42,420
Wait, what?

6397
05:52:43,800 --> 05:52:44,920
Wait, I'm not even...

6398
05:52:44,920 --> 05:52:49,140
No, I think Rabbit is even worse.

6399
05:52:57,870 --> 05:52:59,730
No, no, no.

6400
05:53:00,250 --> 05:53:02,550
Rabbit is even worse than Lion King.

6401
05:53:02,650 --> 05:53:06,790
At least in Lion King, they knew what they were doing when they drew Nala.

6402
05:53:07,170 --> 05:53:13,530
When they did the animation with Nala and those eyes, they knew exactly what the fuck they were doing.

6403
05:53:13,530 --> 05:53:15,690
Rabbit, you have no excuse.

6404
05:53:16,010 --> 05:53:17,530
You have...

6405
05:53:18,730 --> 05:53:21,710
You have no excuse for Rabbit.

6406
05:53:25,650 --> 05:53:28,190
They knew what they were doing with Kovu and Nala.

6407
05:53:28,590 --> 05:53:29,530
Kovu and...

6408
05:53:31,410 --> 05:53:35,370
Kiara and Nala, they knew exactly what they were doing.

6409
05:53:44,330 --> 05:53:45,770
Hey, thank you for the super chat.

6410
05:53:45,770 --> 05:53:46,710
Thank you, thank you.

6411
05:53:46,750 --> 05:53:48,110
Yes, PTSD.

6412
05:53:52,830 --> 05:53:54,630
Fudge, I need you to explain.

6413
05:53:54,930 --> 05:53:55,830
What about Rabbit?

6414
05:53:57,130 --> 05:53:58,790
I think that just means you're...

6415
05:53:58,790 --> 05:54:01,930
I think that means you're a gilf.

6416
05:54:02,570 --> 05:54:03,950
You're into gilfs.

6417
05:54:17,030 --> 05:54:18,750
Oh, that's freaky.

6418
05:54:19,490 --> 05:54:21,270
That's actually freaky.

6419
05:54:21,270 --> 05:54:24,250
What am I supposed to do here?

6420
05:54:35,370 --> 05:54:37,710
We don't know how.

6421
05:54:38,790 --> 05:54:39,770
You know how.

6422
05:54:40,010 --> 05:54:40,790
You're embarrassed.

6423
05:54:44,310 --> 05:54:45,770
You know how.

6424
05:54:53,400 --> 05:54:54,220
Oh, there you go.

6425
05:54:54,260 --> 05:54:55,080
You just gotta turn it.

6426
05:54:55,140 --> 05:54:56,240
What kind of puzzle is this?

6427
05:54:56,280 --> 05:54:57,140
You just turn it.

6428
05:55:03,310 --> 05:55:04,270
I mean, look at Rabbit.

6429
05:55:05,190 --> 05:55:07,030
It tells us a lot about...

6430
05:55:09,070 --> 05:55:13,870
If you got your awakening from Rabbit, it tells us a lot.

6431
05:55:14,150 --> 05:55:15,010
What the fuck?

6432
05:55:15,070 --> 05:55:15,930
Why are you here?

6433
05:55:19,770 --> 05:55:20,350
Oh, there.

6434
05:55:20,410 --> 05:55:21,530
What are you doing here?

6435
05:55:30,750 --> 05:55:31,430
I'm looking for Tigger.

6436
05:55:31,910 --> 05:55:34,050
But if you are...

6437
05:55:34,050 --> 05:55:35,550
I saw him just a bit ago.

6438
05:55:36,430 --> 05:55:37,610
At least, I think it was him.

6439
05:55:38,050 --> 05:55:42,850
Before you see him, the Tigger I think I saw did not have any stripes.

6440
05:55:43,650 --> 05:55:44,830
So I'm not sure...

6441
05:55:47,910 --> 05:55:48,790
That's mean.

6442
05:55:49,490 --> 05:55:51,330
Now he's definitely gonna be depressed now.

6443
05:55:54,110 --> 05:55:55,450
Yeah, I'm gonna steal this.

6444
05:55:55,450 --> 05:55:55,910
XD

6445
05:55:58,970 --> 05:56:00,030
Oh, full?

6446
05:56:00,190 --> 05:56:01,470
Oh my god, I'm stealing this.

6447
05:56:01,890 --> 05:56:03,450
You don't need it anyway, Pooh Bear.

6448
05:56:05,890 --> 05:56:06,430
No!

6449
05:56:07,610 --> 05:56:09,610
Don't do this to me!

6450
05:56:10,590 --> 05:56:12,750
And then it goes this far?

6451
05:56:13,890 --> 05:56:15,710
God, I hate it when that happens.

6452
05:56:18,550 --> 05:56:20,090
Oh, I'm gonna steal some balloons.

6453
05:56:28,570 --> 05:56:30,730
There must be something with this.

6454
05:56:31,230 --> 05:56:32,910
Why is this here?

6455
05:56:33,370 --> 05:56:34,510
There has to be.

6456
05:56:34,690 --> 05:56:36,150
This looks so weird.

6457
05:56:36,290 --> 05:56:37,310
It's so out of place.

6458
05:56:38,250 --> 05:56:39,630
Is it up top?

6459
05:56:42,370 --> 05:56:46,010
There has to be something up top.

6460
05:56:46,690 --> 05:56:48,250
There's no cookies here.

6461
05:56:50,290 --> 05:56:52,830
Yeah, I think something up... Oh, the hole!

6462
05:56:52,830 --> 05:56:54,450
I almost forgot about the hole.

6463
05:56:55,710 --> 05:56:56,150
Fudge!

6464
05:56:56,250 --> 05:56:57,190
Thank you for the super chat!

6465
05:56:57,330 --> 05:56:58,190
Thank you, thank you!

6466
05:56:58,650 --> 05:57:00,270
I ain't gonna speak for my kid self.

6467
05:57:00,430 --> 05:57:03,710
Kid Fudge Top was weird, but at least he doesn't...

6468
05:57:04,550 --> 05:57:06,050
Thank you for the super chat!

6469
05:57:06,170 --> 05:57:08,750
Who are you implying does that?

6470
05:57:09,610 --> 05:57:10,530
Garfield is pure.

6471
05:57:11,050 --> 05:57:11,290
XD

6472
05:57:27,650 --> 05:57:28,630
Oh, up there?

6473
05:57:31,330 --> 05:57:33,270
Rue, I should adopt his son?

6474
05:57:33,710 --> 05:57:34,810
Yeah, cheer him up.

6475
05:57:41,150 --> 05:57:42,350
What the fuck?

6476
05:57:43,850 --> 05:57:44,310
Rue!

6477
05:57:44,550 --> 05:57:45,550
Fucking help!

6478
05:57:47,050 --> 05:57:48,730
Rue, I can't jump that high!

6479
05:57:48,730 --> 05:57:49,390
I'm a pig!

6480
05:57:50,670 --> 05:57:51,530
He's like...

6481
05:57:52,290 --> 05:57:54,790
Oops, sorry, I forgot you're a...

6482
05:57:54,790 --> 05:57:56,050
I forgot you can't do that.

6483
05:58:00,210 --> 05:58:02,330
Okay, give me a sec, little guy.

6484
05:58:03,210 --> 05:58:03,730
Please!

6485
05:58:09,110 --> 05:58:10,370
What the fuck?

6486
05:58:10,970 --> 05:58:12,910
Why am I using a weak-ass move?

6487
05:58:14,850 --> 05:58:17,190
Oh god, oh god, oh god!

6488
05:58:17,630 --> 05:58:17,930
No!

6489
05:58:18,850 --> 05:58:19,250
Please!

6490
05:58:21,110 --> 05:58:22,210
Oh my god, please!

6491
05:58:23,550 --> 05:58:24,490
Wait, there's two!

6492
05:58:26,170 --> 05:58:27,150
Okay, that's fine.

6493
05:58:28,670 --> 05:58:29,710
I can kill him.

6494
05:58:34,010 --> 05:58:34,510
Okay.

6495
05:58:34,510 --> 05:58:36,070
Rue just said skill issue.

6496
05:58:36,470 --> 05:58:37,670
Literally, he could've helped.

6497
05:58:38,050 --> 05:58:39,990
He did not have to do that.

6498
05:58:40,170 --> 05:58:41,790
He could've jumped.

6499
05:58:42,010 --> 05:58:43,690
Look, the thing is...

6500
05:58:43,690 --> 05:58:45,970
He could've jumped to the top.

6501
05:58:46,810 --> 05:58:47,870
Held his head up.

6502
05:58:48,930 --> 05:58:49,990
Oh, but he's a child.

6503
05:58:50,110 --> 05:58:51,970
I don't know if he could do that, but...

6504
05:58:51,970 --> 05:58:53,710
He could've actually easily picked me up.

6505
05:58:56,890 --> 05:58:57,390
Okay.

6506
05:58:59,310 --> 05:59:00,490
Okay, this should kill him.

6507
05:59:00,490 --> 05:59:02,370
This should kill him.

6508
05:59:04,490 --> 05:59:05,250
Nice.

6509
05:59:06,730 --> 05:59:07,470
Consume.

6510
05:59:08,670 --> 05:59:09,530
Alright, I got it.

6511
05:59:10,570 --> 05:59:11,950
Is there anything I'm missing?

6512
05:59:12,730 --> 05:59:13,490
Cookies!

6513
05:59:14,430 --> 05:59:15,190
Cookies!

6514
05:59:16,450 --> 05:59:18,330
Oh my god, we're so close!

6515
05:59:18,890 --> 05:59:20,130
We're almost free!

6516
05:59:20,250 --> 05:59:21,530
From the cookie den!

6517
05:59:22,750 --> 05:59:26,310
We're almost free from the cookie den!

6518
05:59:27,210 --> 05:59:29,530
There's so many cookies!

6519
05:59:30,210 --> 05:59:32,690
Oh my god, look at all these cookies!

6520
05:59:35,830 --> 05:59:36,930
Oh, it's okay!

6521
05:59:37,070 --> 05:59:41,770
We just need 100 and 100 and 450.

6522
05:59:44,070 --> 05:59:45,630
It's okay, we'll get there.

6523
05:59:50,390 --> 05:59:51,450
We're gonna be free.

6524
05:59:51,790 --> 05:59:53,890
One last drop and he'll let me go for sure.

6525
05:59:54,810 --> 05:59:56,930
That's what the mafia is really known for.

6526
05:59:57,010 --> 05:59:59,250
If you pay off your debt, you won't be dragged back in.

6527
06:00:01,930 --> 06:00:03,790
That's what we all know about the mafia.

6528
06:00:09,690 --> 06:00:10,090
Okay.

6529
06:00:10,630 --> 06:00:11,450
Can I use my balloon?

6530
06:00:11,450 --> 06:00:11,590
Balloon?

6531
06:00:23,790 --> 06:00:24,390
Oh,

6532
06:00:29,030 --> 06:00:29,930
the bridge!

6533
06:00:30,330 --> 06:00:32,130
Okay, we gotta go past the bridge.

6534
06:00:32,630 --> 06:00:35,610
I mean, I could go fly there!

6535
06:00:38,030 --> 06:00:40,970
Technically, I could use it to fly a little bit!

6536
06:00:43,950 --> 06:00:46,890
Okay, we gotta go cross the bridge.

6537
06:00:48,230 --> 06:00:50,590
Time to cross that bridge!

6538
06:00:51,910 --> 06:00:53,430
Okay, it's like this way.

6539
06:00:54,450 --> 06:00:55,410
I can't wait.

6540
06:00:55,950 --> 06:00:59,450
I cannot wait to get more cookies!

6541
06:01:00,830 --> 06:01:02,630
I can't wait to get more cookies!

6542
06:01:04,530 --> 06:01:06,750
No, and then I'm gonna go straight.

6543
06:01:06,750 --> 06:01:08,330
I'm gonna go clean.

6544
06:01:09,190 --> 06:01:10,150
I've learned.

6545
06:01:12,070 --> 06:01:12,670
Guys...

6546
06:01:13,570 --> 06:01:14,750
Guys, I'm gonna...

6547
06:01:16,710 --> 06:01:18,650
I'm gonna go clean after this.

6548
06:01:18,870 --> 06:01:20,030
No more cookies after.

6549
06:01:28,370 --> 06:01:30,890
I don't have any withdrawals!

6550
06:01:31,230 --> 06:01:31,830
Whatsoever!

6551
06:01:34,630 --> 06:01:35,550
Oh, nice.

6552
06:01:35,670 --> 06:01:36,230
Wait, what?

6553
06:01:37,250 --> 06:01:39,030
I could've just thrown a rock at it.

6554
06:01:40,650 --> 06:01:41,350
Dead chat!

6555
06:01:41,470 --> 06:01:42,210
Thank you for the super chat!

6556
06:01:42,470 --> 06:01:46,090
It would be funny if someone ate all the cookies before you could pay the debt.

6557
06:01:46,490 --> 06:01:48,230
I've never played this game, but maybe.

6558
06:01:49,050 --> 06:01:50,170
No, don't say that.

6559
06:01:50,250 --> 06:01:50,970
Don't say that.

6560
06:01:52,870 --> 06:01:53,750
I'm sweeping.

6561
06:01:54,330 --> 06:01:55,350
Sweep, sweep, sweep.

6562
06:01:56,390 --> 06:01:57,470
Sweep, sweep, sweep.

6563
06:01:58,390 --> 06:01:59,590
Sweep, sweep, sweep.

6564
06:02:00,630 --> 06:02:01,690
Sweep, sweep, sweep.

6565
06:02:02,230 --> 06:02:03,130
I did it.

6566
06:02:03,990 --> 06:02:05,810
I did chores even in a dream.

6567
06:02:09,030 --> 06:02:09,910
There has to be something for this.

6568
06:02:10,450 --> 06:02:12,330
I can feel it.

6569
06:02:13,130 --> 06:02:13,750
Kick!

6570
06:02:16,730 --> 06:02:18,830
Please tell me it's just one face.

6571
06:02:21,130 --> 06:02:23,110
Wait, there's a gardener now?

6572
06:02:24,610 --> 06:02:25,550
Oh no.

6573
06:02:26,610 --> 06:02:30,310
Oh no, he seems very big.

6574
06:02:31,790 --> 06:02:33,150
God, we're so close.

6575
06:02:35,130 --> 06:02:36,990
Okay, we gotta get rid of the gardener.

6576
06:02:37,810 --> 06:02:39,610
We gotta get rid of the help.

6577
06:02:41,850 --> 06:02:42,650
What?

6578
06:02:44,590 --> 06:02:46,390
He can obscure vision?

6579
06:02:46,990 --> 06:02:48,690
How do you see my UI?

6580
06:02:50,490 --> 06:02:54,750
He has the power of breaking the fourth wall.

6581
06:03:00,740 --> 06:03:02,120
Oh my god.

6582
06:03:03,340 --> 06:03:05,820
The power of breaking the fourth wall.

6583
06:03:07,500 --> 06:03:08,300
Nice.

6584
06:03:08,300 --> 06:03:08,540
Fence.

6585
06:03:10,340 --> 06:03:10,860
Fence.

6586
06:03:11,780 --> 06:03:12,300
No.

6587
06:03:14,040 --> 06:03:16,300
Get the next...

6588
06:03:18,060 --> 06:03:19,740
Oh, there's an amusement park here.

6589
06:03:20,040 --> 06:03:20,980
There's a bench, I knew it.

6590
06:03:22,180 --> 06:03:23,980
I knew the bench had that cookie.

6591
06:03:24,720 --> 06:03:25,340
I knew it.

6592
06:03:25,600 --> 06:03:26,580
I can feel it.

6593
06:03:28,060 --> 06:03:29,140
Can I go through here?

6594
06:03:34,100 --> 06:03:34,620
Yeah!

6595
06:03:38,300 --> 06:03:38,800
What?

6596
06:03:40,180 --> 06:03:40,840
No.

6597
06:03:44,200 --> 06:03:46,520
But all I have are cookies.

6598
06:03:47,400 --> 06:03:49,800
That's my only form of currency.

6599
06:03:50,840 --> 06:03:52,280
What do you mean?

6600
06:03:54,220 --> 06:03:55,800
In a dream?

6601
06:03:56,880 --> 06:03:58,140
I have no money?

6602
06:04:02,220 --> 06:04:03,540
Who's gonna catch me?

6603
06:04:03,600 --> 06:04:04,480
There's no one there.

6604
06:04:04,640 --> 06:04:06,460
There's no one there to catch me.

6605
06:04:09,000 --> 06:04:10,620
I'll just jump over it.

6606
06:04:14,000 --> 06:04:15,820
Maybe it'll take my money.

6607
06:04:16,700 --> 06:04:17,340
Wait, what's this?

6608
06:04:17,380 --> 06:04:18,040
This isn't a shovel?

6609
06:04:19,340 --> 06:04:20,680
Oh my god, it's a nice shovel.

6610
06:04:22,000 --> 06:04:23,380
They get to reuse the acid.

6611
06:04:23,480 --> 06:04:23,920
Let's go.

6612
06:04:26,600 --> 06:04:27,620
Oh my god.

6613
06:04:27,840 --> 06:04:29,460
They get to reuse the acid.

6614
06:04:29,640 --> 06:04:30,860
Let's fucking go!

6615
06:04:32,800 --> 06:04:33,840
Wait, where do I go?

6616
06:04:34,040 --> 06:04:35,560
Wait, where do I go though?

6617
06:04:41,780 --> 06:04:43,380
What needed a shovel?

6618
06:04:46,060 --> 06:04:47,420
I don't remember what area.

6619
06:04:47,920 --> 06:04:49,420
Oh, the snow!

6620
06:04:49,660 --> 06:04:50,060
The snow!

6621
06:04:55,700 --> 06:04:56,200
Okay,

6622
06:04:59,600 --> 06:05:00,840
that makes sense though.

6623
06:05:00,980 --> 06:05:02,700
That was a lot of people's awakening.

6624
06:05:04,200 --> 06:05:04,840
No, no, no.

6625
06:05:04,900 --> 06:05:06,500
Rabbit was the weird one, Sharko.

6626
06:05:06,600 --> 06:05:07,380
No, you're normal.

6627
06:05:10,780 --> 06:05:11,260
Sharko.

6628
06:05:11,500 --> 06:05:11,780
Sharko.

6629
06:05:11,780 --> 06:05:13,420
No, it's one of the top five.

6630
06:05:14,120 --> 06:05:15,560
It's like Kovu.

6631
06:05:16,500 --> 06:05:17,200
It's like what?

6632
06:05:17,500 --> 06:05:19,020
Kovu, Robin Hood.

6633
06:05:19,360 --> 06:05:20,560
The Robin Hood movie.

6634
06:05:20,780 --> 06:05:22,720
Because it was like Robin Hood and his girlfriend.

6635
06:05:25,620 --> 06:05:26,320
It's okay.

6636
06:05:26,660 --> 06:05:27,780
It's like Lion King.

6637
06:05:28,160 --> 06:05:29,180
Okay, I'm just going to say the movies.

6638
06:05:29,360 --> 06:05:30,480
It's not just Simba.

6639
06:05:30,640 --> 06:05:34,280
It's like Simba, Kovu, and Kiara.

6640
06:05:34,280 --> 06:05:36,760
So like Lion King, Robin Hood.

6641
06:05:36,900 --> 06:05:38,560
Yeah, the Disney Robin Hood movie.

6642
06:05:38,940 --> 06:05:40,380
Lola Bunny, Gadget.

6643
06:05:41,460 --> 06:05:43,040
From Rescue Rangers.

6644
06:05:43,820 --> 06:05:44,740
And then...

6645
06:05:44,740 --> 06:05:46,000
I don't remember who are the other...

6646
06:05:46,000 --> 06:05:47,700
I know that's like the top five for people.

6647
06:05:50,300 --> 06:05:51,860
You seem to know a lot.

6648
06:05:52,120 --> 06:05:54,280
Because I remember I googled like...

6649
06:05:55,280 --> 06:05:56,580
What was it?

6650
06:05:56,860 --> 06:05:58,260
There was like a Disney...

6651
06:05:58,260 --> 06:05:59,840
It was like hottest Disney character.

6652
06:06:00,380 --> 06:06:02,160
Somebody made a list.

6653
06:06:02,160 --> 06:06:04,780
Of like hottest Disney characters.

6654
06:06:05,000 --> 06:06:06,420
And it was like one of them.

6655
06:06:11,890 --> 06:06:14,370
And I remember like she put a dog on it.

6656
06:06:14,410 --> 06:06:15,470
And I was like what the fuck?

6657
06:06:16,910 --> 06:06:17,790
Oh shit.

6658
06:06:18,050 --> 06:06:19,170
Oh fuck, oh no.

6659
06:06:20,090 --> 06:06:21,410
Am I faster than these guys?

6660
06:06:21,550 --> 06:06:22,130
I don't know.

6661
06:06:22,670 --> 06:06:23,870
We are going to find out today.

6662
06:06:25,270 --> 06:06:26,290
Oh yeah, nice.

6663
06:06:29,130 --> 06:06:30,550
I don't remember why I googled it.

6664
06:06:30,610 --> 06:06:31,970
I think like somebody asked.

6665
06:06:32,090 --> 06:06:33,370
And then like let's google it.

6666
06:06:37,690 --> 06:06:39,890
Yeah and Jessica Rabbit too.

6667
06:06:40,050 --> 06:06:40,250
Yeah.

6668
06:06:47,660 --> 06:06:48,340
Yeah!

6669
06:06:50,380 --> 06:06:52,360
Alright Rue, it took me five hours.

6670
06:06:52,420 --> 06:06:53,260
But I'm coming over.

6671
06:06:53,940 --> 06:06:55,180
Thanks for helping me.

6672
06:07:00,460 --> 06:07:01,140
Alright.

6673
06:07:01,400 --> 06:07:02,220
What the fuck?

6674
06:07:02,780 --> 06:07:03,840
Bateman Tigger.

6675
06:07:07,160 --> 06:07:07,840
Sabertooth.

6676
06:07:08,000 --> 06:07:09,400
Oh fucking, there it is.

6677
06:07:09,400 --> 06:07:10,560
There it is.

6678
06:07:10,600 --> 06:07:11,480
How much do I need to pay?

6679
06:07:11,800 --> 06:07:13,100
140, okay.

6680
06:07:17,930 --> 06:07:18,810
Not that bad.

6681
06:07:18,890 --> 06:07:19,730
Wait, I'm almost there.

6682
06:07:20,270 --> 06:07:21,210
I'm almost there.

6683
06:07:22,410 --> 06:07:23,270
Wait, Rabbit?

6684
06:07:23,630 --> 06:07:25,050
Wait, everybody's here.

6685
06:07:33,150 --> 06:07:34,070
Fudge Top, look!

6686
06:07:38,210 --> 06:07:39,090
Look, Fudge Top!

6687
06:07:39,090 --> 06:07:39,490
Look, Fudge Top!

6688
06:07:43,870 --> 06:07:46,050
You can warm him up right now!

6689
06:07:50,310 --> 06:07:53,610
Oh, Fudge Top is looking for some rare seed.

6690
06:08:04,570 --> 06:08:06,230
Why is he shaking like that?

6691
06:08:06,250 --> 06:08:07,770
Because he knows Fudge Top is watching.

6692
06:08:09,930 --> 06:08:12,570
He should have told me about the rabbit.

6693
06:08:14,410 --> 06:08:15,530
Doki, please.

6694
06:08:17,530 --> 06:08:19,010
Jaden, thank you for the super chat.

6695
06:08:19,090 --> 06:08:20,230
Thank you, thank you.

6696
06:08:20,530 --> 06:08:22,050
Doki plays Pooh Bear.

6697
06:08:22,350 --> 06:08:23,490
Kids game combo.

6698
06:08:24,210 --> 06:08:25,030
Without any doubt.

6699
06:08:25,150 --> 06:08:28,270
Thank you for the super chat.

6700
06:08:35,670 --> 06:08:36,710
Oh wait, what did I get?

6701
06:08:36,890 --> 06:08:37,330
What is that?

6702
06:08:41,270 --> 06:08:42,770
Oh, maybe that's what he's looking for.

6703
06:08:42,790 --> 06:08:43,790
What the fuck, Pooh Bear?

6704
06:08:43,850 --> 06:08:44,710
What are you doing here?

6705
06:08:45,610 --> 06:08:46,510
How did you get here?

6706
06:08:46,510 --> 06:08:47,630
Okay, Pooh Bear.

6707
06:08:50,990 --> 06:08:51,470
What?

6708
06:09:05,850 --> 06:09:07,510
Why would I need to feed him honey?

6709
06:09:08,990 --> 06:09:13,670
Okay, I'm gonna give Rabbit his little thing.

6710
06:09:14,230 --> 06:09:14,950
Here's your seed.

6711
06:09:19,390 --> 06:09:21,530
It's a very big seed.

6712
06:09:25,170 --> 06:09:26,290
Yeah.

6713
06:09:33,790 --> 06:09:37,990
Oh, nice.

6714
06:09:38,990 --> 06:09:40,650
Seized Doki.

6715
06:09:44,650 --> 06:09:47,090
Okay, I can finally buy this face.

6716
06:09:52,750 --> 06:09:54,550
You're just gonna let me do that footage?

6717
06:09:54,770 --> 06:09:55,250
In front of me?

6718
06:09:59,710 --> 06:10:02,950
Oh my god, what the fuck?

6719
06:10:04,990 --> 06:10:07,010
My pig's like, yay!

6720
06:10:08,070 --> 06:10:09,930
What the fuck was that?

6721
06:10:10,410 --> 06:10:12,050
What the fuck was that?

6722
06:10:14,070 --> 06:10:15,550
Oh my god.

6723
06:10:17,210 --> 06:10:20,150
Okay, that looks like a fucking horror show right there.

6724
06:10:21,890 --> 06:10:24,710
But he had to, like, have his mouth open too.

6725
06:10:25,610 --> 06:10:27,050
Alright, here's the honey, Pooh Bear.

6726
06:10:42,650 --> 06:10:43,110
What?

6727
06:10:54,410 --> 06:10:54,970
What?

6728
06:11:02,290 --> 06:11:04,730
He doesn't know I stole the honey from him.

6729
06:11:04,850 --> 06:11:05,770
That's why he's hungry.

6730
06:11:24,470 --> 06:11:25,630
Okay, Pooh Bear.

6731
06:11:31,150 --> 06:11:35,630
Not gonna lie, Piglet voice acting sounds like it hurts.

6732
06:11:38,950 --> 06:11:41,450
That's like Pooh, at least he's like, oh such as rude.

6733
06:11:41,890 --> 06:11:44,030
But like, Piglet sounds like, strained.

6734
06:11:47,390 --> 06:11:50,070
Yeah, sounds like it would hurt to do.

6735
06:11:53,490 --> 06:11:56,750
Why do they all sound so pathetic?

6736
06:11:57,530 --> 06:12:00,490
Cause they're fucking a children's imagination.

6737
06:12:01,110 --> 06:12:05,670
Like, it's not pathetic, it's childlike wonder.

6738
06:12:06,430 --> 06:12:09,690
You just, you've just lost it.

6739
06:12:12,550 --> 06:12:14,430
Oh no, not again.

6740
06:12:14,970 --> 06:12:18,010
No, no, don't do this to me.

6741
06:12:18,010 --> 06:12:21,870
I'm just a little guy.

6742
06:12:28,350 --> 06:12:30,290
Oh my god.

6743
06:12:30,850 --> 06:12:33,110
Gordon, thank you for the super chat.

6744
06:12:33,230 --> 06:12:34,150
Thank you, thank you.

6745
06:12:34,510 --> 06:12:38,390
It's been six hours and Dragoons are openly admitting their childhood awakenings.

6746
06:12:38,750 --> 06:12:42,830
You gotta finish this game fast before we confess to our crimes.

6747
06:12:43,230 --> 06:12:45,770
Thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

6748
06:12:47,990 --> 06:12:52,250
Sharko, I sent my super chat to try and take Keats off Fudge only for Doki to call me normal.

6749
06:12:52,490 --> 06:12:53,750
Thank you for the super chat, thank you.

6750
06:12:54,270 --> 06:12:55,470
Okay, so run!

6751
06:12:55,470 --> 06:12:56,990
And he gave me away.

6752
06:12:57,790 --> 06:12:59,910
Well, I shall just have to try it again.

6753
06:13:00,150 --> 06:13:01,410
It's okay, Pooh.

6754
06:13:01,690 --> 06:13:03,490
I can try to find another way.

6755
06:13:04,030 --> 06:13:08,590
But Piglet, I'm your friend, and we shall help each other.

6756
06:13:09,210 --> 06:13:12,110
This time, I'll be sure to make it.

6757
06:13:12,870 --> 06:13:16,010
Gax, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

6758
06:13:16,850 --> 06:13:21,570
Today's my birthday, I'm mostly a lurker, but I've decided to try and...

6759
06:13:21,570 --> 06:13:26,370
No, oh no, oh no, oh no, no, no!

6760
06:13:28,650 --> 06:13:32,190
Dad, don't do this to me!

6761
06:13:33,330 --> 06:13:35,430
I'm so slow!

6762
06:13:38,310 --> 06:13:40,170
I'm being slow!

6763
06:13:40,950 --> 06:13:46,830
Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday...

6764
06:13:46,830 --> 06:13:49,630
No, no, no, that's Fudge!

6765
06:13:50,130 --> 06:13:53,190
No, that's so Fudge, I didn't know where to go!

6766
06:13:55,690 --> 06:13:58,010
Happy birthday, dear Gax!

6767
06:13:58,210 --> 06:14:00,250
Happy birthday to you, yeah!

6768
06:14:00,910 --> 06:14:03,990
Where the fuck is the... oh, it's over here, it's over here.

6769
06:14:04,290 --> 06:14:06,230
It's over here.

6770
06:14:07,770 --> 06:14:10,490
Okay, I decided to try and interact with the community more.

6771
06:14:10,610 --> 06:14:14,010
So right now, thank you all for the fun moments these past years, and I hope you have fun.

6772
06:14:14,310 --> 06:14:17,430
Thank you again for every super chat, and again, happy birthday to you!

6773
06:14:18,410 --> 06:14:20,890
Okay, why does this seem... look at him!

6774
06:14:21,230 --> 06:14:23,610
What do you mean, why does this seem so difficult?

6775
06:14:23,810 --> 06:14:24,570
Look at him!

6776
06:14:26,270 --> 06:14:29,830
Oh, fucking... no, it's a maze?!

6777
06:14:29,830 --> 06:14:33,390
Oh my god, it's a...

6778
06:14:35,830 --> 06:14:37,190
Guys, goodbye.

6779
06:14:40,550 --> 06:14:42,290
Wait, unless... no!

6780
06:14:42,970 --> 06:14:44,650
This is so...

6781
06:14:49,170 --> 06:14:50,990
Oh my god!

6782
06:14:52,310 --> 06:14:54,430
Why is this one so hard?!

6783
06:14:56,910 --> 06:14:59,090
I looked into their eyes.

6784
06:15:01,190 --> 06:15:04,370
Oh my god, I looked into their eyes, I know it was over.

6785
06:15:09,470 --> 06:15:10,830
Oh my god.

6786
06:15:11,730 --> 06:15:13,530
Okay, if I do it here...

6787
06:15:16,430 --> 06:15:17,030
Okay.

6788
06:15:18,570 --> 06:15:22,190
Okay, I just need to juke them like this.

6789
06:15:23,590 --> 06:15:26,030
And then... surely...

6790
06:15:26,950 --> 06:15:28,850
That's good, we're doing it!

6791
06:15:29,290 --> 06:15:30,870
Oh my god, the vibrations!

6792
06:15:32,050 --> 06:15:33,810
No, they're on my trail!

6793
06:15:37,550 --> 06:15:37,950
Okay.

6794
06:15:38,310 --> 06:15:40,050
Yeah, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you!

6795
06:15:40,110 --> 06:15:42,850
Some of these faces remind me of those Brickrock Source films.

6796
06:15:42,970 --> 06:15:44,930
Yeah, it does, it looks like those Scout faces.

6797
06:15:44,930 --> 06:15:46,990
Thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you!

6798
06:15:47,070 --> 06:15:48,570
Okay, we figured this one out.

6799
06:15:48,970 --> 06:15:51,930
But how the fuck do we do the second one?!

6800
06:15:52,770 --> 06:15:55,390
And the hard part is like, it's trial and error, because it's a maze.

6801
06:15:56,190 --> 06:15:57,250
That's the hard part.

6802
06:15:57,670 --> 06:16:00,110
That's the fucked up part, that they put me through this.

6803
06:16:08,610 --> 06:16:09,010
Unless...

6804
06:16:09,570 --> 06:16:10,530
Can I go back?

6805
06:16:12,250 --> 06:16:14,170
I don't know what to do!

6806
06:16:14,330 --> 06:16:16,230
I don't know how to do this!

6807
06:16:19,370 --> 06:16:20,850
I don't know!

6808
06:16:21,530 --> 06:16:23,090
I just...

6809
06:16:25,370 --> 06:16:27,230
Like, where do I go?!

6810
06:16:32,170 --> 06:16:32,910
Okay.

6811
06:16:33,410 --> 06:16:34,930
Alright, here we go again.

6812
06:16:36,150 --> 06:16:37,710
Here we go again.

6813
06:16:39,070 --> 06:16:40,410
I don't know.

6814
06:16:40,670 --> 06:16:42,270
I just, I don't know.

6815
06:16:42,870 --> 06:16:45,290
I feel like every...

6816
06:16:45,890 --> 06:16:48,570
Oh my god, no, this is bad.

6817
06:16:49,570 --> 06:16:51,250
This is so bad.

6818
06:16:53,460 --> 06:16:54,910
This is so bad.

6819
06:16:55,070 --> 06:16:55,990
No!

6820
06:16:57,100 --> 06:16:57,690
God!

6821
06:16:59,320 --> 06:16:59,910
God!

6822
06:17:03,260 --> 06:17:05,970
Oh my god, please!

6823
06:17:06,770 --> 06:17:08,890
The poopy, please!

6824
06:17:09,550 --> 06:17:13,730
Why don't you go a little faster?!

6825
06:17:16,110 --> 06:17:18,510
Why aren't you just a little faster?

6826
06:17:18,970 --> 06:17:20,350
Don't ask for much.

6827
06:17:20,550 --> 06:17:23,510
I just want you to be a little faster.

6828
06:17:33,730 --> 06:17:34,330
Okay.

6829
06:17:35,310 --> 06:17:37,030
Okay, we gotta loop-de-loop.

6830
06:17:37,570 --> 06:17:39,450
We gotta loop-de-loop.

6831
06:17:39,910 --> 06:17:43,170
We gotta loop-de- Oh shit, the pee's coming!

6832
06:17:45,450 --> 06:17:47,270
He's on my tail!

6833
06:17:47,270 --> 06:17:48,910
He's literally...

6834
06:17:48,910 --> 06:17:50,510
Holy fuck!

6835
06:17:51,050 --> 06:17:52,770
He's literally on my tail!

6836
06:17:53,490 --> 06:17:55,550
He's like, I'm gonna get you.

6837
06:17:56,130 --> 06:17:57,310
I'm gonna get you.

6838
06:17:58,250 --> 06:17:59,090
I'm gonna...

6839
06:17:59,090 --> 06:18:00,850
I'm gonna get you!

6840
06:18:02,890 --> 06:18:04,990
Please, not the pee's!

6841
06:18:07,210 --> 06:18:08,070
Oh my god.

6842
06:18:08,750 --> 06:18:09,670
The poo-ga-tory.

6843
06:18:10,030 --> 06:18:12,370
This is actually the poo-ga-tory right now.

6844
06:18:12,870 --> 06:18:13,870
I don't know.

6845
06:18:13,870 --> 06:18:16,750
I don't know how to get out of here.

6846
06:18:20,950 --> 06:18:22,290
I don't know.

6847
06:18:24,010 --> 06:18:27,090
Can I be faster than this guy?

6848
06:18:27,850 --> 06:18:28,870
Is it possible?

6849
06:18:31,430 --> 06:18:31,890
Is it-

6850
06:18:35,410 --> 06:18:36,030
Wowee!

6851
06:18:37,570 --> 06:18:38,190
Wowee!

6852
06:18:39,870 --> 06:18:41,210
Wowee, I did it!

6853
06:18:41,530 --> 06:18:42,890
Oh my god, it was so tight!

6854
06:18:42,890 --> 06:18:45,170
It was actually so close!

6855
06:18:46,170 --> 06:18:48,930
Holy shit, I swear it was like one or two pixels.

6856
06:18:50,110 --> 06:18:50,510
Alright.

6857
06:18:51,970 --> 06:18:52,610
This is it.

6858
06:18:52,730 --> 06:18:53,470
I'm free.

6859
06:18:54,270 --> 06:18:55,030
Freedom!

6860
06:18:58,210 --> 06:18:58,970
Freedom!

6861
06:19:03,670 --> 06:19:07,550
Oh my god, the frame-perfect dodge.

6862
06:19:09,970 --> 06:19:11,050
And he waddled away.

6863
06:19:11,330 --> 06:19:12,490
Are you serious?

6864
06:19:12,950 --> 06:19:13,390
No!

6865
06:19:15,090 --> 06:19:17,310
That's actually- Oh, thank god there's none of them.

6866
06:19:17,790 --> 06:19:18,870
Oh, thank god.

6867
06:19:18,950 --> 06:19:21,610
I was gonna say, that's actually fucking evil.

6868
06:19:25,890 --> 06:19:27,950
That would've been so evil.

6869
06:19:44,330 --> 06:19:45,130
Huh?

6870
06:19:47,970 --> 06:19:48,770
What?

6871
06:19:51,270 --> 06:19:53,050
What do you mean?

6872
06:19:54,690 --> 06:19:55,810
Pooh bear?

6873
06:19:57,690 --> 06:19:58,830
Pooh bear?

6874
06:20:00,150 --> 06:20:02,250
Oh, I found another pot of honey, okay.

6875
06:20:02,970 --> 06:20:04,450
So I did nothing?

6876
06:20:06,290 --> 06:20:07,150
Oh my god.

6877
06:20:09,030 --> 06:20:11,090
I did all that?

6878
06:20:13,630 --> 06:20:15,770
I did all that for nothing?

6879
06:20:16,770 --> 06:20:17,790
No, I didn't!

6880
06:20:18,050 --> 06:20:19,210
I didn't!

6881
06:20:22,650 --> 06:20:23,630
Why does he wear pants?

6882
06:20:23,830 --> 06:20:26,410
Why the fuck is Piglet just fucking not even a shirt?

6883
06:20:26,950 --> 06:20:28,570
He's leaving it all hanging out.

6884
06:20:34,270 --> 06:20:38,690
Oh my god.

6885
06:20:38,690 --> 06:20:38,690
Okay,

6886
06:20:49,190 --> 06:20:50,510
but like...

6887
06:20:50,510 --> 06:20:51,710
Her eyes, though.

6888
06:20:52,170 --> 06:20:53,410
What does rabbit have?

6889
06:20:53,410 --> 06:20:54,150
Like...

6890
06:20:57,030 --> 06:20:59,650
Like, it makes sense.

6891
06:20:59,830 --> 06:21:00,710
Her eyes.

6892
06:21:00,870 --> 06:21:03,010
What the fuck does rabbit have?

6893
06:21:04,190 --> 06:21:04,990
Like...

6894
06:21:20,570 --> 06:21:22,690
You don't understand.

6895
06:21:22,910 --> 06:21:23,850
Rabbit's a hag.

6896
06:21:26,610 --> 06:21:28,230
Guys, I need to know.

6897
06:21:28,230 --> 06:21:29,370
Guys, I need to know.

6898
06:21:30,050 --> 06:21:32,210
Is there another face that I have to...

6899
06:21:32,210 --> 06:21:34,130
Guys, no, this is very important, guys.

6900
06:21:34,550 --> 06:21:36,470
Is there another face?

6901
06:21:36,630 --> 06:21:37,750
Guys, I need to know.

6902
06:21:38,410 --> 06:21:39,870
Guys, you have to...

6903
06:21:39,870 --> 06:21:42,370
Guys, do I need to buy another face?

6904
06:21:42,790 --> 06:21:45,690
This determines if I start collecting more cookies.

6905
06:21:46,470 --> 06:21:48,290
I don't care if it's spoilers.

6906
06:21:48,930 --> 06:21:50,770
Guys, this is very important.

6907
06:22:00,280 --> 06:22:00,780
Yes!

6908
06:22:00,780 --> 06:22:03,300
I'll never get that.

6909
06:22:04,340 --> 06:22:06,180
That's 150!

6910
06:22:10,420 --> 06:22:11,500
That's 100.

6911
06:22:11,820 --> 06:22:13,660
I'm not gonna make it.

6912
06:22:18,480 --> 06:22:19,720
Oh my god.

6913
06:22:20,280 --> 06:22:21,640
This is actual hell.

6914
06:22:23,540 --> 06:22:25,020
Water away.

6915
06:22:27,500 --> 06:22:29,580
Okay, the heat pack should work.

6916
06:22:31,920 --> 06:22:33,440
Cough, cough, cough.

6917
06:22:35,920 --> 06:22:36,800
One more.

6918
06:22:37,780 --> 06:22:38,840
Oh, another bean.

6919
06:22:43,520 --> 06:22:47,760
Okay, we gotta get rid of these guys.

6920
06:22:48,000 --> 06:22:49,240
Because there's more cookies.

6921
06:22:54,450 --> 06:22:57,390
Oh god, I hate that face.

6922
06:22:57,950 --> 06:23:00,630
I actually hate it.

6923
06:23:01,250 --> 06:23:04,110
It looks so fucking wrong.

6924
06:23:04,970 --> 06:23:06,430
Oh my god.

6925
06:23:08,190 --> 06:23:10,030
130 left to go.

6926
06:23:12,870 --> 06:23:15,690
Yeah, that looks like Uzumaki's shit.

6927
06:23:16,150 --> 06:23:18,890
It literally looks like Junji Ito.

6928
06:23:20,210 --> 06:23:22,510
Oh my god, no, I thought it was one last job.

6929
06:23:22,750 --> 06:23:25,030
Guys, this time, the one last job.

6930
06:23:25,650 --> 06:23:30,070
They promised me it's the last one and then they'll stop to let go of my family.

6931
06:23:39,650 --> 06:23:42,150
I'm just gonna run past this and then start kicking.

6932
06:23:43,350 --> 06:23:45,130
I'm gonna kick!

6933
06:23:46,290 --> 06:23:47,810
There has to be one!

6934
06:23:49,710 --> 06:23:50,650
What's this?

6935
06:23:59,490 --> 06:24:00,610
Okay, I don't have...

6936
06:24:04,770 --> 06:24:05,210
Okay.

6937
06:24:10,370 --> 06:24:13,090
Okay, I thought this was an extra hidden thing.

6938
06:24:13,470 --> 06:24:15,510
Watching, thank you for the super chat, thank you!

6939
06:24:17,410 --> 06:24:19,050
Okay, I gotta get rid of these guys.

6940
06:24:19,770 --> 06:24:21,110
Oh my god, I still...

6941
06:24:22,150 --> 06:24:23,690
There's so many...

6942
06:24:23,690 --> 06:24:26,210
There's so many faces!

6943
06:24:26,210 --> 06:24:26,810
Faces!

6944
06:24:29,510 --> 06:24:32,690
So random, thank you for the super chat, thank you!

6945
06:24:37,270 --> 06:24:39,470
Gotta collect faces.

6946
06:24:40,610 --> 06:24:41,790
Gotta work.

6947
06:24:42,910 --> 06:24:44,250
Work for the boss.

6948
06:24:49,270 --> 06:24:51,550
Gotta make him happy.

6949
06:24:51,970 --> 06:24:52,250
Kick.

6950
06:24:54,830 --> 06:24:56,770
At least these are like one hit now.

6951
06:25:03,830 --> 06:25:04,990
Thank god.

6952
06:25:05,650 --> 06:25:08,290
Gonna cry, cry you little bitch.

6953
06:25:08,870 --> 06:25:10,430
I fucking...

6954
06:25:10,430 --> 06:25:11,890
We're almost to the end.

6955
06:25:13,310 --> 06:25:13,890
Kick!

6956
06:25:14,070 --> 06:25:14,690
Oh no.

6957
06:25:15,890 --> 06:25:17,690
There has to be one more for me to kick.

6958
06:25:19,830 --> 06:25:20,630
Fight me!

6959
06:25:21,170 --> 06:25:21,770
Fight me!

6960
06:25:22,710 --> 06:25:24,430
Fight, turn, look at me!

6961
06:25:27,210 --> 06:25:28,110
That's right.

6962
06:25:29,010 --> 06:25:30,530
I'm not afraid of you.

6963
06:25:31,630 --> 06:25:33,070
I'm gonna start kicking.

6964
06:25:39,950 --> 06:25:41,390
That's fucking right.

6965
06:25:43,590 --> 06:25:44,370
Disappear!

6966
06:25:45,850 --> 06:25:46,390
Okay.

6967
06:25:47,990 --> 06:25:48,730
Kick.

6968
06:25:48,990 --> 06:25:50,310
What the fuck is this BGM?

6969
06:25:53,050 --> 06:25:53,830
Like...

6970
06:25:53,830 --> 06:25:55,970
Like why is it like...

6971
06:25:58,800 --> 06:26:01,030
This BGM is like extra freaky.

6972
06:26:01,970 --> 06:26:03,090
Is none of... wait.

6973
06:26:03,090 --> 06:26:05,930
Oh my god, I'm like literally missing one.

6974
06:26:06,650 --> 06:26:08,790
Missing the kick, I don't know which one.

6975
06:26:13,710 --> 06:26:15,230
Oh my cursor, sorry.

6976
06:26:19,130 --> 06:26:19,650
Alright.

6977
06:26:21,610 --> 06:26:23,010
Where did they come from?

6978
06:26:24,890 --> 06:26:26,350
Oh, we have to kill them.

6979
06:26:26,670 --> 06:26:27,430
For the bridge.

6980
06:26:35,100 --> 06:26:36,100
Okay, nice.

6981
06:26:36,240 --> 06:26:37,020
We got their soul.

6982
06:26:38,140 --> 06:26:39,620
Okay, soul acquired.

6983
06:26:41,400 --> 06:26:42,040
Kick.

6984
06:26:42,540 --> 06:26:43,020
Kick.

6985
06:26:43,780 --> 06:26:46,940
There has to be some cookies here.

6986
06:26:48,200 --> 06:26:51,300
Someone must have a stash somewhere.

6987
06:26:52,180 --> 06:26:53,200
Look at me!

6988
06:26:55,080 --> 06:26:56,100
Look at me.

6989
06:26:56,600 --> 06:26:57,640
I'm desperate.

6990
06:26:58,300 --> 06:27:00,640
I have nothing to lose anymore.

6991
06:27:04,980 --> 06:27:05,760
Wait, what?

6992
06:27:06,360 --> 06:27:07,320
Oh...

6993
06:27:07,320 --> 06:27:08,280
No, no, no, no, no!

6994
06:27:09,060 --> 06:27:10,320
God damn it!

6995
06:27:14,880 --> 06:27:17,180
I just wanted to kick.

6996
06:27:18,960 --> 06:27:22,680
I literally missed one, because I was button mashing.

6997
06:27:29,660 --> 06:27:30,640
Alright, nice.

6998
06:27:36,210 --> 06:27:37,470
Wait, how did you get here, Rue?

6999
06:27:37,890 --> 06:27:40,710
Wait, did you jump all the way back there?

7000
06:27:40,790 --> 06:27:41,690
What do you need me for?

7001
06:27:42,890 --> 06:27:43,930
Wait a minute.

7002
06:27:45,710 --> 06:27:46,230
Rue...

7003
06:27:46,230 --> 06:27:50,210
What did you need me here for anyway?

7004
06:27:50,750 --> 06:27:53,440
If you're just gonna jump over here...

7005
06:27:55,610 --> 06:27:56,510
Rue...

7006
06:27:56,510 --> 06:28:00,230
That's when you talk to Christopher and be happy again.

7007
06:28:06,650 --> 06:28:07,550
Alright.

7008
06:28:09,330 --> 06:28:10,730
Okay, let's kick this.

7009
06:28:12,070 --> 06:28:12,370
Kick.

7010
06:28:14,010 --> 06:28:14,910
Alright.

7011
06:28:17,170 --> 06:28:18,070
Kick!

7012
06:28:19,990 --> 06:28:20,950
Oh my God.

7013
06:28:21,850 --> 06:28:23,330
100 more, guys.

7014
06:28:24,110 --> 06:28:25,890
Wilkie, welcome to Tomato Farm!

7015
06:28:25,970 --> 06:28:26,670
Welcome, welcome!

7016
06:28:27,910 --> 06:28:28,970
100 more.

7017
06:28:29,870 --> 06:28:31,190
We're almost out, guys.

7018
06:28:32,610 --> 06:28:33,890
We're almost out.

7019
06:28:36,830 --> 06:28:39,050
Is there a tree I can kick here?

7020
06:28:39,130 --> 06:28:40,450
Oh wait, there is a tree over there.

7021
06:28:41,750 --> 06:28:43,450
Be happy, don't be sad.

7022
06:28:45,950 --> 06:28:47,830
What do I do with him?

7023
06:28:49,570 --> 06:28:50,770
Can I get out of the tree?

7024
06:28:51,250 --> 06:28:52,050
Okay, nice.

7025
06:28:56,180 --> 06:28:56,700
Yeah.

7026
06:28:57,600 --> 06:29:00,400
Nice, and then this has to be where some cookies are.

7027
06:29:05,380 --> 06:29:05,980
Nice.

7028
06:29:07,300 --> 06:29:07,900
90.

7029
06:29:08,400 --> 06:29:09,240
90 left.

7030
06:29:12,540 --> 06:29:13,520
Hello, Rue.

7031
06:29:14,280 --> 06:29:16,760
It's nice of you to not wait for me.

7032
06:29:24,820 --> 06:29:26,980
Oh, we need a whoopee flower?

7033
06:29:27,320 --> 06:29:28,880
Say no more.

7034
06:29:30,060 --> 06:29:31,840
Look what I've got here, Rue.

7035
06:29:35,130 --> 06:29:36,350
That's right.

7036
06:29:36,870 --> 06:29:37,870
I'm a hero.

7037
06:29:38,850 --> 06:29:41,710
And then a rain cloud shows up because...

7038
06:29:41,710 --> 06:29:42,010
Okay.

7039
06:29:44,250 --> 06:29:44,870
Oh.

7040
06:29:45,170 --> 06:29:47,190
Okay, that's...

7041
06:29:48,730 --> 06:29:49,450
Rue.

7042
06:29:50,110 --> 06:29:51,570
You can jump.

7043
06:29:52,590 --> 06:29:56,310
But I know you won't do that because you don't do physical labor.

7044
06:30:00,790 --> 06:30:02,010
Yes, don't worry, Rue.

7045
06:30:02,170 --> 06:30:02,710
Just watch.

7046
06:30:02,910 --> 06:30:04,510
Yeah, just stand there.

7047
06:30:05,590 --> 06:30:07,070
Yeah, that's fine.

7048
06:30:08,570 --> 06:30:12,310
Uncle Piglet's gonna do this all by himself.

7049
06:30:14,270 --> 06:30:15,170
That's fine.

7050
06:30:24,090 --> 06:30:25,570
Yeah, thank you for the super chat.

7051
06:30:25,670 --> 06:30:26,650
Thank you, thank you.

7052
06:30:26,650 --> 06:30:28,890
Is Piglet wearing a modified version?

7053
06:30:29,350 --> 06:30:30,790
Thank you for the super chat.

7054
06:30:31,010 --> 06:30:31,740
Thank you, thank you.

7055
06:30:39,210 --> 06:30:40,490
Oh wait, no.

7056
06:30:40,550 --> 06:30:42,070
I already got all the cookies, right?

7057
06:30:42,450 --> 06:30:43,130
In this area?

7058
06:30:43,650 --> 06:30:45,110
Because it's all blurring together already.

7059
06:30:45,250 --> 06:30:46,270
I don't remember.

7060
06:30:47,530 --> 06:30:48,950
Okay, up we go.

7061
06:30:58,690 --> 06:30:59,170
Whoa.

7062
06:31:02,090 --> 06:31:03,390
No, it was Death Note.

7063
06:31:06,570 --> 06:31:07,530
But like...

7064
06:31:07,530 --> 06:31:10,750
Okay, so like when you grow- Okay, so like...

7065
06:31:10,750 --> 06:31:12,270
When you grow up with like...

7066
06:31:12,270 --> 06:31:15,950
You know, fanfiction.net and like Tumblr...

7067
06:31:15,950 --> 06:31:18,090
And like stuff like that.

7068
06:31:18,410 --> 06:31:19,910
It's not about the awakening.

7069
06:31:20,470 --> 06:31:23,050
It's about what- It's about...

7070
06:31:23,970 --> 06:31:24,830
Chips.

7071
06:31:27,490 --> 06:31:29,510
It's about chipping.

7072
06:31:49,330 --> 06:31:51,450
It's about lemons and limes.

7073
06:31:55,330 --> 06:31:55,730
Forever.

7074
06:32:02,210 --> 06:32:03,910
Why is he smiling?

7075
06:32:05,170 --> 06:32:06,770
Piglet, why are you smiling?

7076
06:32:09,150 --> 06:32:11,130
Piglet's just like...

7077
06:32:11,130 --> 06:32:11,850
Oh my gosh.

7078
06:32:12,330 --> 06:32:16,470
It's so sad that you lost your stripes.

7079
06:32:21,270 --> 06:32:22,430
Wow, Tiggy.

7080
06:32:22,710 --> 06:32:25,270
It's so sad.

7081
06:32:26,270 --> 06:32:27,850
My God.

7082
06:32:27,850 --> 06:32:31,870
That's so unfortunate for you.

7083
06:32:32,630 --> 06:32:33,310
Bro.

7084
06:32:33,810 --> 06:32:35,230
Like, his smile.

7085
06:32:35,470 --> 06:32:36,770
Did you see that smile?

7086
06:32:36,970 --> 06:32:37,850
It's so...

7087
06:32:38,890 --> 06:32:40,850
It was so like...

7088
06:32:42,610 --> 06:32:45,790
It was definitely not a sympathetic smile.

7089
06:32:47,090 --> 06:32:48,030
Oh, 100%.

7090
06:32:48,030 --> 06:32:49,150
I don't care about the plot.

7091
06:32:51,550 --> 06:32:53,430
Thank you for the super chat.

7092
06:32:53,830 --> 06:32:55,010
Thank you, thank you.

7093
06:32:55,010 --> 06:32:56,370
And I was like...

7094
06:32:56,370 --> 06:32:57,970
Like, fanfiction.net?

7095
06:32:58,370 --> 06:32:59,470
Are you...

7096
06:33:02,030 --> 06:33:05,810
A lot of people lied about their age on those websites.

7097
06:33:08,930 --> 06:33:10,590
I hate Slowburn.

7098
06:33:14,050 --> 06:33:16,170
Slowburn was not it for me.

7099
06:33:18,670 --> 06:33:22,010
Okay, since you guys revealed stuff...

7100
06:33:22,650 --> 06:33:24,250
So like, when I was like...

7101
06:33:24,250 --> 06:33:27,010
When I see like a fanfiction...

7102
06:33:28,110 --> 06:33:28,750
What the fuck?

7103
06:33:31,590 --> 06:33:32,970
Okay, not this.

7104
06:33:36,410 --> 06:33:38,330
Okay, so like...

7105
06:33:38,330 --> 06:33:39,010
So like...

7106
06:33:40,910 --> 06:33:41,710
I was like...

7107
06:33:41,710 --> 06:33:42,510
I was just like...

7108
06:33:42,510 --> 06:33:45,930
Okay, I don't care about the Slowburn.

7109
06:33:46,110 --> 06:33:46,390
Yeah?

7110
06:33:46,710 --> 06:33:49,030
And I see a fanfiction that I might like.

7111
06:33:49,210 --> 06:33:51,270
I'll reveal this about myself because we're...

7112
06:33:52,090 --> 06:33:54,890
Almost 7 hours deep into this fucking game.

7113
06:33:55,090 --> 06:33:57,010
I would be like...

7114
06:33:57,650 --> 06:33:58,080
Ctrl-F...

7115
06:33:58,950 --> 06:33:59,430
Kiss.

7116
06:34:04,710 --> 06:34:07,170
And then I got what I wanted.

7117
06:34:10,690 --> 06:34:12,550
I got what I need.

7118
06:34:17,670 --> 06:34:18,950
That's all it took.

7119
06:34:19,030 --> 06:34:20,010
I was just like...

7120
06:34:20,010 --> 06:34:20,230
Yup.

7121
06:34:22,890 --> 06:34:24,270
Yeah, but like...

7122
06:34:24,270 --> 06:34:26,710
Some people might not have heard about it.

7123
06:34:32,620 --> 06:34:34,980
Some people might not have known.

7124
06:34:35,620 --> 06:34:37,120
What do I need a magnet for?

7125
06:34:39,300 --> 06:34:40,280
Wait, what?

7126
06:34:43,000 --> 06:34:44,640
Guys, what would the magnet be?

7127
06:34:51,000 --> 06:34:52,660
Darkblade, thank you for the superchat thing.

7128
06:34:52,700 --> 06:34:53,240
Thank you.

7129
06:34:53,300 --> 06:34:55,640
That's why you never reveal anything embarrassing to Doki.

7130
06:34:55,780 --> 06:34:58,080
Unless you want her to use it against you.

7131
06:34:58,080 --> 06:35:00,560
I learned this very early on.

7132
06:35:01,520 --> 06:35:02,680
Thank you for the superchat thing.

7133
06:35:02,760 --> 06:35:03,560
Thank you.

7134
06:35:04,780 --> 06:35:05,740
Oh, the dart!

7135
06:35:06,100 --> 06:35:06,720
I remember now.

7136
06:35:06,780 --> 06:35:07,240
It's the dart.

7137
06:35:12,780 --> 06:35:13,600
It's the dart.

7138
06:35:16,540 --> 06:35:18,040
Um, sir, thank you for the superchat thing.

7139
06:35:18,100 --> 06:35:18,620
Thank you.

7140
06:35:18,680 --> 06:35:19,160
That's right.

7141
06:35:19,460 --> 06:35:22,440
Piglet, point and laugh at Tony the Tigerless over there.

7142
06:35:22,760 --> 06:35:23,800
Thank you for the superchat thing.

7143
06:35:23,840 --> 06:35:24,540
Thank you.

7144
06:35:26,020 --> 06:35:27,460
Budge, thank you for the superchat thing.

7145
06:35:27,460 --> 06:35:28,280
Thank you.

7146
06:35:29,660 --> 06:35:32,240
I remember my Inuyasha face for fanfics.

7147
06:35:32,620 --> 06:35:36,620
One-shot lemons were the best, but my mom did wonder why I was using her work.

7148
06:35:37,380 --> 06:35:38,700
But people be like...

7149
06:35:38,700 --> 06:35:40,140
When I tell people I like reading.

7150
06:35:40,900 --> 06:35:42,380
They don't know what I was reading.

7151
06:35:49,150 --> 06:35:51,530
Okay, this soundtrack is so unnerving.

7152
06:35:58,670 --> 06:35:59,150
CM.

7153
06:36:00,050 --> 06:36:01,430
Jayden, thank you for the superchat thing.

7154
06:36:01,430 --> 06:36:02,230
Thank you.

7155
06:36:02,310 --> 06:36:03,370
New opener idea.

7156
06:36:03,730 --> 06:36:04,550
Who would you read?

7157
06:36:04,630 --> 06:36:05,010
Slowbird?

7158
06:36:05,010 --> 06:36:05,490
Nobody.

7159
06:36:05,550 --> 06:36:06,470
Who the f...

7160
06:36:07,630 --> 06:36:09,310
I can't deal with Slowbird.

7161
06:36:09,510 --> 06:36:10,070
I was like...

7162
06:36:10,810 --> 06:36:14,610
If I want to see them like fucking slowly fall in love.

7163
06:36:14,690 --> 06:36:18,070
I'll fucking watch the show and then be delusional with my headcanons.

7164
06:36:20,430 --> 06:36:24,370
I'll watch whatever like show, movie, or video game they're from.

7165
06:36:28,630 --> 06:36:30,190
I'm here for the action.

7166
06:36:36,920 --> 06:36:38,840
If I see Slowbird...

7167
06:36:38,840 --> 06:36:42,200
Okay, this is how I choose Slowbird.

7168
06:36:42,680 --> 06:36:43,840
I would be like...

7169
06:36:44,540 --> 06:36:45,680
I'd be like...

7170
06:36:45,680 --> 06:36:47,200
Okay, Slowbird...

7171
06:36:47,780 --> 06:36:50,140
Slowbird story that has a lot of kudos.

7172
06:36:50,680 --> 06:36:52,620
That's a lot of love on it.

7173
06:36:53,060 --> 06:36:54,580
And then this is what I did.

7174
06:36:55,300 --> 06:36:56,940
These were my tricks.

7175
06:36:57,160 --> 06:36:57,900
Tips and tricks.

7176
06:36:58,140 --> 06:36:59,240
But I don't do that anymore.

7177
06:36:59,480 --> 06:37:00,180
Because like...

7178
06:37:00,180 --> 06:37:01,800
I want to say I grew up out of it.

7179
06:37:01,860 --> 06:37:04,480
I think I definitely grew out of it.

7180
06:37:05,340 --> 06:37:06,940
But I would like...

7181
06:37:06,940 --> 06:37:07,840
I'd press...

7182
06:37:07,840 --> 06:37:09,440
Okay, this is for an archive of our own.

7183
06:37:09,900 --> 06:37:10,540
I'd press...

7184
06:37:10,540 --> 06:37:12,300
Entire work...

7185
06:37:12,300 --> 06:37:13,100
Control F...

7186
06:37:13,440 --> 06:37:13,860
Kiss.

7187
06:37:17,520 --> 06:37:20,060
Skip everything and get right to it.

7188
06:37:24,800 --> 06:37:26,140
There's like...

7189
06:37:26,740 --> 06:37:28,220
30 chapters...

7190
06:37:28,220 --> 06:37:29,160
Entire work...

7191
06:37:29,160 --> 06:37:29,960
Control F...

7192
06:37:29,960 --> 06:37:30,320
Kiss.

7193
06:37:30,420 --> 06:37:31,260
Okay, there we go.

7194
06:37:34,240 --> 06:37:34,860
That's...

7195
06:37:34,860 --> 06:37:40,050
I don't need to know the context.

7196
06:37:40,350 --> 06:37:42,810
I can gather the context from the summary.

7197
06:37:45,710 --> 06:37:46,590
As well...

7198
06:37:46,590 --> 06:37:48,650
I can literally gather the context from the...

7199
06:37:48,650 --> 06:37:50,430
The story summary.

7200
06:37:50,590 --> 06:37:52,070
And just realize they're right there.

7201
06:37:52,190 --> 06:37:53,010
And they made it.

7202
06:37:53,450 --> 06:37:54,070
They...

7203
06:37:54,070 --> 06:37:55,030
They...

7204
06:37:55,030 --> 06:37:56,210
They made it.

7205
06:37:58,970 --> 06:38:00,810
I was on a mission.

7206
06:38:13,830 --> 06:38:14,270
Alright.

7207
06:38:17,250 --> 06:38:17,690
Poke.

7208
06:38:18,410 --> 06:38:19,010
I did it.

7209
06:38:19,190 --> 06:38:21,090
I fixed your house, Tigger.

7210
06:38:28,240 --> 06:38:29,760
Stray, thank you for the super chat.

7211
06:38:29,900 --> 06:38:30,120
Thank you.

7212
06:38:30,300 --> 06:38:30,640
Thank you.

7213
06:38:34,260 --> 06:38:39,180
When the Powerpuff Girls defeated the Rowdy Ruff boys by giving them the eyes and kissing them.

7214
06:38:39,560 --> 06:38:40,260
Thank you for the super chat.

7215
06:38:40,320 --> 06:38:40,540
Thank you.

7216
06:38:40,600 --> 06:38:41,200
Thank you.

7217
06:38:43,880 --> 06:38:45,260
Alright, I fixed your house.

7218
06:38:45,260 --> 06:38:46,840
I don't need to charge you.

7219
06:38:47,120 --> 06:38:48,360
I'd be fucked if I charged you.

7220
06:38:48,420 --> 06:38:49,320
This is your dream.

7221
06:38:54,010 --> 06:38:58,270
No, I had a shot if I really wanted to get that over with fast.

7222
06:38:58,790 --> 06:39:00,290
It wasn't Control F, Kiss.

7223
06:39:00,410 --> 06:39:01,590
But I don't want to talk about that.

7224
06:39:01,790 --> 06:39:02,850
What my shot was.

7225
06:39:03,270 --> 06:39:04,570
Because that one is embarrassing.

7226
06:39:04,790 --> 06:39:05,690
Okay, let me get more water.

7227
06:39:05,850 --> 06:39:06,470
I'll be right back.

7228
06:40:43,680 --> 06:40:44,080
Alright.

7229
06:40:44,680 --> 06:40:46,080
Thank you for the super chat.

7230
06:40:46,240 --> 06:40:46,460
Thank you.

7231
06:40:47,020 --> 06:40:47,540
Thank you.

7232
06:40:49,520 --> 06:40:52,300
Doki, we need to know that pro strats don't hold out on to us.

7233
06:40:55,280 --> 06:40:57,020
If you are an avid reader.

7234
06:40:58,540 --> 06:40:59,880
You already know the strat.

7235
06:41:00,680 --> 06:41:02,060
You don't need me to tell you.

7236
06:41:03,380 --> 06:41:04,920
You don't need me to tell you.

7237
06:41:12,010 --> 06:41:13,590
If you don't know the strat.

7238
06:41:14,610 --> 06:41:15,950
You're not an avid reader.

7239
06:41:16,970 --> 06:41:17,950
You don't read.

7240
06:41:18,070 --> 06:41:19,130
You don't read these.

7241
06:41:25,820 --> 06:41:29,220
You don't need these strats if you don't know.

7242
06:41:29,360 --> 06:41:31,960
If you already read those, you already know.

7243
06:41:34,000 --> 06:41:35,980
You already know what the strat is.

7244
06:41:40,540 --> 06:41:42,840
Oh, you don't need to use Ao3.

7245
06:41:42,980 --> 06:41:44,040
It's for any fanfiction.

7246
06:41:44,900 --> 06:41:46,380
I don't read anymore.

7247
06:41:47,420 --> 06:41:49,020
In general.

7248
06:41:57,800 --> 06:41:59,010
Yeah, I don't.

7249
06:41:59,510 --> 06:42:01,450
I don't do that anymore.

7250
06:42:08,380 --> 06:42:09,710
I'm too busy gaming.

7251
06:42:10,690 --> 06:42:12,090
I'm just gaming now.

7252
06:42:18,160 --> 06:42:19,500
Wait, how did I get here?

7253
06:42:20,260 --> 06:42:21,200
What?

7254
06:42:27,520 --> 06:42:27,990
What?

7255
06:42:27,990 --> 06:42:28,110
What?

7256
06:42:29,810 --> 06:42:31,930
We're back to the haunted house?

7257
06:42:46,810 --> 06:42:48,390
This game is longer than I anticipated.

7258
06:42:48,790 --> 06:42:49,750
You see, back then.

7259
06:42:50,390 --> 06:42:52,430
On the PlayStation 2.

7260
06:42:54,410 --> 06:42:56,930
Um, you pay $50 for this.

7261
06:42:57,610 --> 06:42:58,450
$50 to $60.

7262
06:42:58,990 --> 06:43:00,750
And there's no Steam sale whatsoever.

7263
06:43:04,910 --> 06:43:06,350
And people act.

7264
06:43:07,150 --> 06:43:10,690
People com- You think like people back then complained a lot?

7265
06:43:11,510 --> 06:43:13,730
This- People.

7266
06:43:14,410 --> 06:43:15,230
About like, oh.

7267
06:43:15,670 --> 06:43:17,590
This game shouldn't be that expensive.

7268
06:43:17,850 --> 06:43:18,350
Blah, blah, blah.

7269
06:43:18,410 --> 06:43:19,250
Because it's like.

7270
06:43:19,770 --> 06:43:21,490
There's only that much playtime.

7271
06:43:21,830 --> 06:43:22,390
So like.

7272
06:43:24,550 --> 06:43:25,550
So like, yeah.

7273
06:43:27,930 --> 06:43:29,110
There was a lot.

7274
06:43:29,210 --> 06:43:32,150
People had padded games a lot more back then.

7275
06:43:34,550 --> 06:43:36,710
Especially when it's geared towards children.

7276
06:43:37,130 --> 06:43:40,130
Because children doesn't know what the fu- Oh my god, I fucking knew it.

7277
06:43:40,450 --> 06:43:41,810
I fucking- Oh my god.

7278
06:43:41,890 --> 06:43:42,610
There you are.

7279
06:43:44,290 --> 06:43:45,470
There you are.

7280
06:43:45,870 --> 06:43:46,110
What?

7281
06:43:46,290 --> 06:43:47,290
Oh, there you are.

7282
06:43:47,350 --> 06:43:48,110
I see you.

7283
06:43:48,930 --> 06:43:50,070
I see you.

7284
06:43:52,890 --> 06:43:54,230
One last face.

7285
06:43:55,290 --> 06:43:56,950
One last face.

7286
06:43:57,790 --> 06:43:59,050
Where are you?

7287
06:44:00,410 --> 06:44:02,030
Where did you go?

7288
06:44:02,910 --> 06:44:04,910
I shall kick everything.

7289
06:44:05,690 --> 06:44:07,590
Okay, I need to get the winter.

7290
06:44:09,070 --> 06:44:11,070
And then the- The fall.

7291
06:44:12,230 --> 06:44:14,190
And then- Okay, there has to be.

7292
06:44:15,370 --> 06:44:17,010
There has to- Okay, there you go.

7293
06:44:18,870 --> 06:44:19,650
Oh my god.

7294
06:44:20,390 --> 06:44:22,250
Guys, I don't think we're gonna find it here.

7295
06:44:23,110 --> 06:44:24,150
I don't think-

7296
06:44:28,150 --> 06:44:28,670
Guys.

7297
06:44:29,190 --> 06:44:30,990
I don't- Guys.

7298
06:44:31,450 --> 06:44:33,510
This is looking a little grim right now.

7299
06:44:33,510 --> 06:44:41,770
This is actually- This is- This is looking a little grim right now.

7300
06:44:42,410 --> 06:44:45,230
I don't think there's 50 cookies for me.

7301
06:44:48,370 --> 06:44:50,770
Okay, we need this and the trumpet guy.

7302
06:44:51,690 --> 06:44:52,250
Get over here.

7303
06:44:52,370 --> 06:44:52,910
Get over here!

7304
06:44:52,990 --> 06:44:53,710
Look at me!

7305
06:44:55,850 --> 06:44:56,990
Look at me!

7306
06:44:57,110 --> 06:44:57,430
Okay.

7307
06:45:02,940 --> 06:45:03,500
Alright.

7308
06:45:03,900 --> 06:45:04,800
I got spinny spin.

7309
06:45:09,740 --> 06:45:16,440
Okay, spinny spin got- This should be- Nice!

7310
06:45:16,540 --> 06:45:16,820
Okay.

7311
06:45:18,080 --> 06:45:18,560
Oh.

7312
06:45:18,740 --> 06:45:20,160
Yeah, that's- I knew it!

7313
06:45:20,320 --> 06:45:23,140
I was like, those- Those area has to be for something.

7314
06:45:23,420 --> 06:45:24,100
I knew it.

7315
06:45:24,980 --> 06:45:26,420
I knew that was for something.

7316
06:45:27,640 --> 06:45:29,320
Okay, and then we need trumpet.

7317
06:45:29,460 --> 06:45:30,840
Where would trumpet be though?

7318
06:45:31,400 --> 06:45:32,540
Is trumpet behind me?

7319
06:45:34,940 --> 06:45:36,880
I think trumpet was behind me.

7320
06:45:36,880 --> 06:45:37,300
Right?

7321
06:45:42,820 --> 06:45:45,000
That spinny spin is so strong.

7322
06:45:46,020 --> 06:45:46,540
I'm glad.

7323
06:45:49,720 --> 06:45:51,040
Do you exist?

7324
06:45:52,240 --> 06:45:53,960
I don't remember the map.

7325
06:45:54,620 --> 06:45:55,500
Wait, Trumpy Trump!

7326
06:45:56,460 --> 06:45:57,580
I'm gonna wake you up.

7327
06:45:58,820 --> 06:45:59,320
Get up!

7328
06:45:59,800 --> 06:46:00,360
Get up!

7329
06:46:01,700 --> 06:46:02,480
Get up!

7330
06:46:04,600 --> 06:46:05,240
Click!

7331
06:46:05,460 --> 06:46:05,980
Get up!

7332
06:46:08,560 --> 06:46:09,200
Okay.

7333
06:46:09,360 --> 06:46:09,540
Oh.

7334
06:46:11,820 --> 06:46:12,220
Clank!

7335
06:46:12,400 --> 06:46:12,900
Get up!

7336
06:46:13,800 --> 06:46:14,440
Get up!

7337
06:46:18,640 --> 06:46:20,260
Alright, that should be it.

7338
06:46:25,820 --> 06:46:28,520
And then we gotta get the winter.

7339
06:46:32,460 --> 06:46:33,020
Yay!

7340
06:46:33,280 --> 06:46:33,580
Summer!

7341
06:46:37,700 --> 06:46:39,280
Okay, and then we go this way.

7342
06:46:42,620 --> 06:46:43,940
Darkblade, thank you for the super chat.

7343
06:46:44,040 --> 06:46:45,000
Thank you, thank you.

7344
06:46:45,140 --> 06:46:45,860
To be more wholesome.

7345
06:46:46,060 --> 06:46:47,300
Doki, I'm so excited for the concert.

7346
06:46:47,420 --> 06:46:49,300
If I see you in the fall 3D with other dragons!

7347
06:46:50,100 --> 06:46:51,560
I hope you're ready to see us also.

7348
06:46:51,680 --> 06:46:52,740
I know you- Yeah, me too!

7349
06:46:52,840 --> 06:46:53,700
I'm super excited!

7350
06:46:54,220 --> 06:46:55,020
I'm really excited.

7351
06:46:55,380 --> 06:46:57,100
I hope, like, my throat gets better though.

7352
06:46:57,380 --> 06:47:01,300
I'm, like, so behind on stuff because my throat is so, like, really fucked up.

7353
06:47:03,240 --> 06:47:04,060
Oh, no, no.

7354
06:47:04,120 --> 06:47:04,860
Not Trumpy Trump.

7355
06:47:05,420 --> 06:47:06,320
Trumpy Trump bad.

7356
06:47:06,480 --> 06:47:06,840
No!

7357
06:47:07,920 --> 06:47:08,280
No!

7358
06:47:08,280 --> 06:47:08,780
No!

7359
06:47:10,440 --> 06:47:11,660
The hole I go.

7360
06:47:12,020 --> 06:47:13,200
The hole I go.

7361
06:47:23,410 --> 06:47:26,490
I hope maybe I can get a doctor's appointment, like, this week.

7362
06:47:26,730 --> 06:47:28,690
But that's wishful thinking.

7363
06:47:29,730 --> 06:47:31,750
Guys, that's me.

7364
06:47:32,430 --> 06:47:34,090
Thinking that, you know.

7365
06:47:36,750 --> 06:47:41,130
Thinking that, you know, there's actual doctors available.

7366
06:47:41,710 --> 06:47:47,430
I think I need to take a rest day and literally live in the hospital until, like, they take me in.

7367
06:47:48,070 --> 06:47:52,350
That's literally- That's literally all I can think of right now.

7368
06:47:52,830 --> 06:47:54,850
No, please let me take this.

7369
06:47:55,230 --> 06:47:55,790
Please!

7370
06:47:56,790 --> 06:47:57,850
Please, Woosa!

7371
06:47:59,870 --> 06:48:04,170
I don't think I can get into a walk-in clinic with an appointment.

7372
06:48:12,270 --> 06:48:13,310
You know what?

7373
06:48:13,350 --> 06:48:14,410
The reviews are a lie.

7374
06:48:15,430 --> 06:48:20,370
You know, I thought, like, it says, like, urgent and primary care.

7375
06:48:20,590 --> 06:48:21,870
But that's a fucking lie.

7376
06:48:22,830 --> 06:48:24,590
It's only urgent care.

7377
06:48:24,850 --> 06:48:38,930
I was reading the reviews and some of them were like, yeah, I just, like, went in in the morning and then I got to, I got to, you know, I got to see the, I got to see a doctor for my child.

7378
06:48:39,170 --> 06:48:42,050
And I'm just thinking, I'm like, is it because I'm not a child?

7379
06:48:42,470 --> 06:48:43,630
Am I not important?

7380
06:48:45,390 --> 06:48:45,790
Like...

7381
06:48:45,790 --> 06:48:48,890
Am I just not important because I'm not a child?

7382
06:48:54,850 --> 06:48:57,310
Literally, the child had the same symptoms as me.

7383
06:49:04,950 --> 06:49:06,130
I'm not sick enough.

7384
06:49:06,230 --> 06:49:08,110
I reset my fucking sick counter.

7385
06:49:08,870 --> 06:49:13,030
I should not have said, I should have withheld that information that I went to fucking America.

7386
06:49:13,490 --> 06:49:14,870
I should have withheld that information.

7387
06:49:15,030 --> 06:49:16,910
Oh, silly me for not withholding it.

7388
06:49:17,030 --> 06:49:18,030
Oh, silly me.

7389
06:49:18,510 --> 06:49:22,110
Silly me for trying to, thinking that I should tell the doctor everything that happened.

7390
06:49:22,110 --> 06:49:26,490
But no, just because, like, just because I was there two weeks ago.

7391
06:49:27,070 --> 06:49:30,270
It's not three weeks because it's a new virus, apparently.

7392
06:49:44,590 --> 06:49:45,350
I know.

7393
06:49:47,650 --> 06:49:49,690
I thought she would write me a prescription.

7394
06:49:50,770 --> 06:49:53,130
I thought that was what she was going to do.

7395
06:49:53,250 --> 06:49:56,610
If I tell her everything and she'll just write me a prescription.

7396
06:49:57,010 --> 06:49:57,550
Silly me.

7397
06:49:58,470 --> 06:50:04,090
It was just her telling me that I don't deserve to be at her doctor's place.

7398
06:50:11,410 --> 06:50:13,850
Okay, and then one last one.

7399
06:50:15,350 --> 06:50:16,710
Here you go, son.

7400
06:50:20,600 --> 06:50:23,120
Yeah, maybe Christopher Robin can cure me.

7401
06:50:23,320 --> 06:50:26,920
He just needs to tell me to stop being sick and then everything will be okay.

7402
06:50:29,760 --> 06:50:31,120
That's it, right?

7403
06:50:32,800 --> 06:50:34,640
It's just that easy, right?

7404
06:50:34,800 --> 06:50:35,920
Let's fucking go!

7405
06:50:39,660 --> 06:50:41,120
Duck, thank you for the super chat.

7406
06:50:41,160 --> 06:50:42,260
Thank you, thank you.

7407
06:50:45,940 --> 06:50:47,180
Oh my god, we did it.

7408
06:50:47,460 --> 06:50:49,220
We got- we're gonna find the stripes.

7409
06:50:50,060 --> 06:50:51,680
What the fuck?

7410
06:50:52,420 --> 06:50:54,920
What do you mean there's another- oh my god.

7411
06:50:55,780 --> 06:50:57,820
Okay, this is- okay.

7412
06:50:58,900 --> 06:51:01,580
What the fuck is wrong with you, Tigger?

7413
06:51:03,040 --> 06:51:04,320
Why a birthday candle?

7414
06:51:07,480 --> 06:51:08,960
You're not Eeyore!

7415
06:51:10,100 --> 06:51:12,580
Oh no, the PTSD is kicking in now.

7416
06:51:21,190 --> 06:51:22,750
Tigger, what the- no, sorry.

7417
06:51:22,950 --> 06:51:25,170
Tigger, what the fuck is going on?

7418
06:51:26,090 --> 06:51:27,450
Your demons are showing.

7419
06:51:35,150 --> 06:51:36,630
Oh hey, it looks better now.

7420
06:51:41,130 --> 06:51:41,770
No!

7421
06:51:41,870 --> 06:51:44,150
Now that I can see what's going on, it's not that bad.

7422
06:51:44,470 --> 06:51:49,590
To be fair, the fucking orange-green-orange does not really make it spooky.

7423
06:51:52,150 --> 06:51:55,330
It's the orange-green-orange color palette there.

7424
06:52:00,390 --> 06:52:04,970
One candle lit over one- you don't understand!

7425
06:52:06,630 --> 06:52:08,570
It's a- it's a better candle.

7426
06:52:08,950 --> 06:52:11,910
It's a grade S candle versus a grade A.

7427
06:52:13,890 --> 06:52:16,790
It's different candle brands, you don't understand.

7428
06:52:20,930 --> 06:52:22,230
Oh my god.

7429
06:52:23,150 --> 06:52:27,550
30 more to go- wait no, 40 more to go, 40 more to go.

7430
06:52:35,190 --> 06:52:36,790
Look, it's the size.

7431
06:52:37,330 --> 06:52:37,770
See?

7432
06:52:38,750 --> 06:52:41,310
The candle size is- what the fuck?

7433
06:52:42,870 --> 06:52:44,230
Holy shit.

7434
06:52:46,810 --> 06:52:48,970
What the fuck is that?

7435
06:52:54,650 --> 06:52:59,510
What the fu- oh my god, fucking bur- I'll burn the stripes right now.

7436
06:52:59,830 --> 06:53:01,470
No, don't do- no.

7437
06:53:02,090 --> 06:53:02,650
No.

7438
06:53:03,210 --> 06:53:06,870
If I don't catch- oh, this is act- no.

7439
06:53:08,210 --> 06:53:08,830
No.

7440
06:53:10,150 --> 06:53:12,770
No, don't- don't do this to me.

7441
06:53:13,130 --> 06:53:15,070
No, that is fucked.

7442
06:53:19,410 --> 06:53:21,570
Don't- don't do this, don't do this.

7443
06:53:21,610 --> 06:53:23,190
Did it just disappear from my pocket?

7444
06:53:23,670 --> 06:53:25,650
I- I still have three more.

7445
06:53:27,110 --> 06:53:29,970
No, don't do this to me!

7446
06:53:29,970 --> 06:53:32,730
Come on.

7447
06:53:35,510 --> 06:53:36,290
No!

7448
06:53:37,490 --> 06:53:41,690
No, get back here and put out this fucking candle!

7449
06:53:42,450 --> 06:53:43,810
Come on.

7450
06:53:45,070 --> 06:53:45,990
No.

7451
06:53:46,950 --> 06:53:49,050
No, this is so fucked.

7452
06:53:49,230 --> 06:53:50,790
This is so fucked.

7453
06:53:52,330 --> 06:53:53,250
Please.

7454
06:53:53,750 --> 06:53:54,170
Please!

7455
06:53:55,850 --> 06:53:57,690
I can't.

7456
06:53:57,690 --> 06:53:59,590
Oh my god!

7457
06:53:59,910 --> 06:54:01,630
Oh my god!

7458
06:54:11,970 --> 06:54:13,370
That's so mean.

7459
06:54:14,270 --> 06:54:16,030
That's actually so mean.

7460
06:54:17,090 --> 06:54:17,850
Please.

7461
06:54:18,830 --> 06:54:20,430
That is so fucking mean.

7462
06:54:20,770 --> 06:54:22,250
Why would they do this to me?

7463
06:54:22,790 --> 06:54:24,350
I'm just a little guy.

7464
06:54:24,850 --> 06:54:31,150
I'm- I'm just- I'm just a little guy.

7465
06:54:31,650 --> 06:54:33,270
Look how little I am.

7466
06:54:36,950 --> 06:54:38,910
Please tell me there's only two left.

7467
06:54:39,650 --> 06:54:40,590
Oh, thank god.

7468
06:54:40,670 --> 06:54:42,230
I swear to god.

7469
06:54:43,530 --> 06:54:43,850
Okay.

7470
06:54:45,970 --> 06:54:47,150
No way!

7471
06:54:47,370 --> 06:54:48,610
No way!

7472
06:54:48,750 --> 06:54:52,930
He just- he- Oh my god, he literally just 180s me.

7473
06:54:53,190 --> 06:54:55,890
Oh my- Oh, please.

7474
06:54:57,690 --> 06:54:58,070
Yes.

7475
06:54:58,290 --> 06:54:58,790
Okay.

7476
06:54:59,070 --> 06:54:59,970
Okay, we got the quarter.

7477
06:55:00,750 --> 06:55:01,330
You're next.

7478
06:55:01,850 --> 06:55:02,330
You're next.

7479
06:55:02,650 --> 06:55:03,090
You're next.

7480
06:55:03,410 --> 06:55:03,890
You're next.

7481
06:55:04,310 --> 06:55:05,070
You're next.

7482
06:55:06,150 --> 06:55:07,270
You're next.

7483
06:55:07,750 --> 06:55:09,290
That's right, got you in the quarter.

7484
06:55:18,710 --> 06:55:20,270
Oh my god.

7485
06:55:21,290 --> 06:55:21,710
This is it.

7486
06:55:23,210 --> 06:55:24,370
I got his stripes.

7487
06:55:25,570 --> 06:55:26,690
This is it.

7488
06:55:27,970 --> 06:55:29,630
Oh my god, and then the door's gonna come over.

7489
06:55:29,810 --> 06:55:30,810
I can feel it.

7490
06:55:31,510 --> 06:55:32,450
I can feel it.

7491
06:55:32,690 --> 06:55:35,290
It's peak door hours now.

7492
06:55:38,890 --> 06:55:40,770
I feel the door calling to him.

7493
06:55:41,950 --> 06:55:43,250
Fucking laughing at me.

7494
06:55:43,350 --> 06:55:44,750
Telling me it's not over.

7495
06:55:48,290 --> 06:55:49,990
Gary, thank you for the super chat.

7496
06:55:50,070 --> 06:55:51,150
Thank you, thank you.

7497
06:55:51,650 --> 06:55:53,510
Yeah, we're still- we're still in it.

7498
06:55:56,830 --> 06:56:01,330
Door hours just gonna come in and be like, JK, I'm gonna doink my stripes now.

7499
06:56:01,530 --> 06:56:02,590
I can feel it.

7500
06:56:02,850 --> 06:56:04,870
I can feel the door hours coming in.

7501
06:56:17,210 --> 06:56:18,650
Ayfin, thank you for the super chat.

7502
06:56:18,750 --> 06:56:19,650
Thank you, thank you.

7503
06:56:20,010 --> 06:56:24,550
Local Apex spread and Overwatch top 500 pilot can't be- No, you don't understand.

7504
06:56:24,930 --> 06:56:26,530
Their AI, it's- they're different.

7505
06:56:26,910 --> 06:56:28,870
You don't understand their AI.

7506
06:56:29,690 --> 06:56:32,230
It's not- it's not the same.

7507
06:56:36,250 --> 06:56:39,430
It's not like what you think it is.

7508
06:56:40,570 --> 06:56:43,450
20 years ago, their AI was different.

7509
06:56:44,710 --> 06:56:47,650
They didn't dumb it down for stupid children.

7510
06:56:50,270 --> 06:56:52,330
They're like, you're gonna learn today.

7511
06:56:56,320 --> 06:56:59,540
I mean, I never finished the game, so I clearly never learned.

7512
06:57:04,170 --> 06:57:05,410
No, it's true though.

7513
06:57:05,590 --> 06:57:10,110
I feel like games back then, they never- they didn't really dumb it down for people.

7514
06:57:10,390 --> 06:57:13,970
They're like, if you don't understand, then fucking, you're just stupid, I guess.

7515
06:57:15,090 --> 06:57:16,550
That's how the games were.

7516
06:57:22,700 --> 06:57:25,760
People literally just stopped playing it because they don't understand.

7517
06:57:31,700 --> 06:57:33,200
They left you alone.

7518
06:57:33,680 --> 06:57:36,960
They're like, fucking, if you can't do it, then fuck you, I guess.

7519
06:57:38,300 --> 06:57:39,260
What does Tigger want?

7520
06:57:39,860 --> 06:57:45,420
I think Tigger's trying to tell us he lost luck at a strife with Tigger.

7521
06:57:45,820 --> 06:57:46,340
Again?!

7522
06:57:46,340 --> 06:57:48,140
It sure doesn't sound like our Tigger.

7523
06:57:48,840 --> 06:57:51,620
I guess losing a strife has really made him scared.

7524
06:57:52,060 --> 06:57:52,640
Oh, it's the door.

7525
06:57:52,940 --> 06:57:54,800
We just have to find Tigger and his strife.

7526
06:57:54,880 --> 06:57:55,560
It's the door.

7527
06:57:57,260 --> 06:57:58,400
It's the door.

7528
06:58:00,720 --> 06:58:04,440
I don't guess I go fucking back!

7529
06:58:07,000 --> 06:58:09,080
I just got there!

7530
06:58:13,530 --> 06:58:14,670
I just got there!

7531
06:58:15,070 --> 06:58:17,810
I just- I just got here!

7532
06:58:18,370 --> 06:58:21,630
What are you- What do you mean?

7533
06:58:22,250 --> 06:58:25,030
I have to go back?!

7534
06:58:26,230 --> 06:58:27,530
I can feel it.

7535
06:58:27,890 --> 06:58:32,730
The door is like, you gotta get the last base, piglet.

7536
06:58:33,410 --> 06:58:36,470
If you wanna see a Tigger!

7537
06:58:37,510 --> 06:58:38,230
I can feel it.

7538
06:58:38,250 --> 06:58:39,310
I'm just gonna look at him.

7539
06:58:39,570 --> 06:58:43,070
Just get this- get the cutscene over with.

7540
06:58:44,970 --> 06:58:46,850
I'm just gonna get the cutscene over with.

7541
06:58:46,930 --> 06:58:47,710
I can feel him.

7542
06:58:47,850 --> 06:58:52,090
He's gonna be there and be like, you gotta get the last stripe!

7543
06:58:52,910 --> 06:58:54,530
The last base!

7544
06:58:56,470 --> 06:58:57,970
The dog needs his cookies.

7545
06:59:02,420 --> 06:59:03,600
Am I gonna see the door?

7546
06:59:04,720 --> 06:59:05,920
Am I gonna see the door?

7547
06:59:06,040 --> 06:59:07,040
Am I gonna see his face?

7548
06:59:07,280 --> 06:59:08,780
It's loading pretty long!

7549
06:59:09,420 --> 06:59:12,140
Oh my god, am I gonna see your fucking ass face, door?

7550
06:59:12,940 --> 06:59:14,560
I fucking-

7551
06:59:28,940 --> 06:59:31,840
Alright, time to exit the dream!

7552
06:59:35,140 --> 06:59:36,240
He's back!

7553
06:59:36,860 --> 06:59:38,640
He's fucking back!

7554
06:59:39,000 --> 06:59:40,560
Oh my god!

7555
06:59:40,560 --> 06:59:43,580
Where can I find cookies?

7556
06:59:45,260 --> 06:59:45,820
Where?

7557
06:59:50,360 --> 06:59:52,020
I need 30.

7558
06:59:52,120 --> 06:59:54,440
I need 30 cookies left.

7559
06:59:54,840 --> 06:59:55,660
But where?

7560
06:59:59,400 --> 07:00:01,840
How did I miss 195?

7561
07:00:03,760 --> 07:00:04,740
Like, where?

7562
07:00:06,000 --> 07:00:06,540
Where?

7563
07:00:07,800 --> 07:00:10,260
Someone said press select and I can see it.

7564
07:00:10,260 --> 07:00:12,700
I don't know what it's gonna show up.

7565
07:00:12,780 --> 07:00:14,360
I pressed select so I'm gonna hide it real quick.

7566
07:00:15,260 --> 07:00:16,420
Oh my god.

7567
07:00:17,160 --> 07:00:19,240
Oh my god, it does show it.

7568
07:00:19,740 --> 07:00:20,740
Oh my god, where?

7569
07:00:21,420 --> 07:00:21,780
Where?

7570
07:00:22,140 --> 07:00:24,580
How am I missing- Okay, there's that.

7571
07:00:24,720 --> 07:00:24,960
Okay.

7572
07:00:25,780 --> 07:00:26,600
Okay, here.

7573
07:00:27,840 --> 07:00:28,680
Okay, here.

7574
07:00:28,760 --> 07:00:30,360
I am missing cookies here.

7575
07:00:30,900 --> 07:00:31,560
I'm here.

7576
07:00:32,200 --> 07:00:32,600
Okay.

7577
07:00:34,000 --> 07:00:38,720
Okay, we're gonna- Kick!

7578
07:00:40,280 --> 07:00:41,040
Okay.

7579
07:00:41,500 --> 07:00:43,040
The one and twos add up.

7580
07:00:45,020 --> 07:00:45,400
Guys.

7581
07:00:45,780 --> 07:00:49,360
Guys, I think the one and two cookies added up.

7582
07:00:49,940 --> 07:00:50,480
Kick!

7583
07:00:50,800 --> 07:00:52,460
Oh, there's twos here.

7584
07:00:57,960 --> 07:00:59,800
They don't fuck around.

7585
07:01:00,260 --> 07:01:04,560
They don't fuck around.

7586
07:01:05,180 --> 07:01:06,200
Okay, next door.

7587
07:01:06,200 --> 07:01:06,300
Next door.

7588
07:01:08,480 --> 07:01:10,460
They actually added up.

7589
07:01:10,660 --> 07:01:11,380
Who would've thought?

7590
07:01:11,960 --> 07:01:14,540
Who would've thought they added up?

7591
07:01:17,020 --> 07:01:19,140
It's back to kicking ours.

7592
07:01:19,680 --> 07:01:21,320
The goddamn door.

7593
07:01:23,060 --> 07:01:23,740
Stupid.

7594
07:01:24,640 --> 07:01:25,280
Fuck you.

7595
07:01:25,680 --> 07:01:27,960
I'm gonna kick him in the balls.

7596
07:01:29,020 --> 07:01:30,640
If I see that guy.

7597
07:01:31,700 --> 07:01:33,140
Oh my god, there you go.

7598
07:01:33,400 --> 07:01:34,600
It's that one cookie.

7599
07:01:34,720 --> 07:01:35,760
Of course it is.

7600
07:01:39,850 --> 07:01:41,730
Okay, we got this area.

7601
07:01:44,610 --> 07:01:45,250
Okay.

7602
07:01:49,310 --> 07:01:51,270
No, we're so close, guys.

7603
07:01:51,590 --> 07:01:52,870
We're so close.

7604
07:01:53,670 --> 07:01:56,470
We need- We need less than 20.

7605
07:01:56,810 --> 07:01:57,630
This is it.

7606
07:01:58,290 --> 07:02:00,530
The cookie hour is upon us.

7607
07:02:02,050 --> 07:02:04,490
And we'll never have to see him again.

7608
07:02:05,050 --> 07:02:06,550
And we'll kill him for good.

7609
07:02:07,550 --> 07:02:09,010
No, all of you, leave.

7610
07:02:09,930 --> 07:02:11,030
All of you, leave.

7611
07:02:11,190 --> 07:02:14,010
I have important kicking business to go to.

7612
07:02:15,210 --> 07:02:16,490
I don't care.

7613
07:02:17,350 --> 07:02:18,170
You don't matter.

7614
07:02:18,410 --> 07:02:18,690
Kick.

7615
07:02:19,550 --> 07:02:20,930
Where would it be?

7616
07:02:22,410 --> 07:02:23,670
Oh my god, no.

7617
07:02:23,730 --> 07:02:24,310
Get over here.

7618
07:02:24,710 --> 07:02:26,530
You're blocking my kicking.

7619
07:02:27,230 --> 07:02:29,010
The bookshelf?!

7620
07:02:30,250 --> 07:02:39,690
Are you- Guys, I figured out where it- Oh my god, it was the bookshelf.

7621
07:02:39,910 --> 07:02:42,690
This is where 100 of my cookies were.

7622
07:02:44,370 --> 07:02:47,930
Oh my god, I was literally missing 100 cookies from this area.

7623
07:02:51,270 --> 07:02:54,790
Oh my god, this is where I was missing 100 cookies.

7624
07:02:55,290 --> 07:02:56,570
It was the bookshelf.

7625
07:02:56,670 --> 07:02:58,170
It was the- Oh my god, okay.

7626
07:02:58,430 --> 07:02:58,990
I'm done.

7627
07:03:00,450 --> 07:03:01,210
I'm done.

7628
07:03:01,990 --> 07:03:03,250
I'm done with this dream.

7629
07:03:04,630 --> 07:03:06,470
It's okay, I just need 140.

7630
07:03:08,060 --> 07:03:09,890
I just need 140.

7631
07:03:17,970 --> 07:03:18,610
Alright.

7632
07:03:20,070 --> 07:03:21,250
I need 100.

7633
07:03:27,650 --> 07:03:30,270
I needed 150.

7634
07:03:31,970 --> 07:03:32,870
My god.

7635
07:03:39,080 --> 07:03:40,560
I'm coming back.

7636
07:03:41,760 --> 07:03:43,840
I'm coming back.

7637
07:03:48,500 --> 07:03:51,340
I'm coming back, everybody.

7638
07:03:51,820 --> 07:03:53,060
Knock, knock.

7639
07:03:53,680 --> 07:03:55,300
I'm the one who knocks.

7640
07:03:55,320 --> 07:03:56,460
I've never watched this show.

7641
07:03:57,020 --> 07:04:00,480
I'm the one who knocks.

7642
07:04:01,720 --> 07:04:03,980
I say a reference I never really understood.

7643
07:04:10,480 --> 07:04:13,380
My Oshie is so smart and literate.

7644
07:04:13,780 --> 07:04:14,760
Not so deadfoot.

7645
07:04:14,920 --> 07:04:15,740
Thank you for the superchat.

7646
07:04:15,840 --> 07:04:16,080
Thank you.

7647
07:04:16,480 --> 07:04:16,920
Run.

7648
07:04:18,180 --> 07:04:18,880
Run.

7649
07:04:19,460 --> 07:04:21,760
I'm here for the cookies.

7650
07:04:24,560 --> 07:04:25,680
That's right.

7651
07:04:29,960 --> 07:04:31,780
One at a time.

7652
07:04:36,820 --> 07:04:39,000
Okay, this should give me a lot.

7653
07:04:40,020 --> 07:04:40,740
Alright, nice.

7654
07:04:42,820 --> 07:04:44,220
This should give me the last two.

7655
07:04:50,850 --> 07:04:54,510
And then I got an extra one just for like a road trip.

7656
07:04:54,890 --> 07:04:56,590
Just to treat myself, you know?

7657
07:04:56,990 --> 07:05:02,070
Just because of a good job I did.

7658
07:05:02,170 --> 07:05:05,530
I'm gonna get myself one just to treat myself.

7659
07:05:07,170 --> 07:05:08,470
Jayden, thank you for the superchat.

7660
07:05:08,550 --> 07:05:09,390
Thank you, thank you.

7661
07:05:10,030 --> 07:05:12,890
My birthday is later this week and I'm 100% making cookies now.

7662
07:05:13,010 --> 07:05:13,690
Thank you for the superchat.

7663
07:05:13,770 --> 07:05:14,670
Thank you, thank you.

7664
07:05:15,510 --> 07:05:17,470
I close my eyes and all I see...

7665
07:05:18,370 --> 07:05:20,190
All I see are cookies.

7666
07:05:20,430 --> 07:05:22,970
I close my eyes and that's all I see.

7667
07:05:28,150 --> 07:05:32,830
In this forest, all I see is cookies.

7668
07:05:39,950 --> 07:05:41,110
Here I go.

7669
07:05:42,870 --> 07:05:44,030
This is it.

7670
07:05:44,210 --> 07:05:45,390
The last phase.

7671
07:05:46,290 --> 07:05:47,670
The final countdown.

7672
07:05:49,870 --> 07:05:51,230
I'm fucking booking it.

7673
07:05:51,950 --> 07:05:52,710
I'm running.

7674
07:05:53,330 --> 07:05:54,250
That's right.

7675
07:05:55,530 --> 07:05:56,430
That's right.

7676
07:05:57,250 --> 07:05:58,530
I'm fucking getting over.

7677
07:05:59,130 --> 07:06:00,490
I'm gonna murder this door.

7678
07:06:00,990 --> 07:06:01,690
I'm gonna make sure to...

7679
07:06:01,690 --> 07:06:04,650
I'm gonna murder him and I'm gonna cut him up into pieces.

7680
07:06:04,930 --> 07:06:06,750
Put him into a sawdust...

7681
07:06:06,750 --> 07:06:08,250
A sawdust shredder.

7682
07:06:08,550 --> 07:06:10,050
Then like...

7683
07:06:10,050 --> 07:06:11,430
Then burn it again.

7684
07:06:13,210 --> 07:06:15,390
And then, I don't know, feed it to beavers.

7685
07:06:15,550 --> 07:06:16,250
I'm fucking...

7686
07:06:16,250 --> 07:06:18,010
Feed it to termites.

7687
07:06:18,610 --> 07:06:22,350
If I separate all pieces of him into dust...

7688
07:06:22,350 --> 07:06:23,190
Into termites...

7689
07:06:23,190 --> 07:06:24,090
Then like...

7690
07:06:25,470 --> 07:06:27,350
Then he'll never be able to come back.

7691
07:06:30,540 --> 07:06:31,580
Yes, a wood chip.

7692
07:06:33,520 --> 07:06:35,280
Because I'm terminally online.

7693
07:06:35,460 --> 07:06:37,040
You think I don't know what a fucking wood...

7694
07:06:37,040 --> 07:06:40,040
Know the name of an actual wood chipper thing is?

7695
07:06:41,020 --> 07:06:43,980
The fact that I got this far is already impressive enough.

7696
07:06:46,120 --> 07:06:46,680
No.

7697
07:06:47,320 --> 07:06:47,660
No.

7698
07:06:48,380 --> 07:06:50,080
Don't let me buy my face.

7699
07:06:50,280 --> 07:06:52,620
Let me buy my face.

7700
07:06:53,460 --> 07:06:54,100
Okay.

7701
07:06:57,860 --> 07:06:59,500
Alright, what is the final phase?

7702
07:07:05,290 --> 07:07:06,570
What is this?

7703
07:07:08,710 --> 07:07:10,490
What the fuck?

7704
07:07:11,070 --> 07:07:16,110
The fuck are you doing?

7705
07:07:16,210 --> 07:07:18,970
Okay, to be fair, I think the second last phase is scarier.

7706
07:07:20,510 --> 07:07:22,550
The second last phase is...

7707
07:07:22,550 --> 07:07:26,310
I think the second last phase is the scariest one out of all of them.

7708
07:07:27,350 --> 07:07:28,050
That one...

7709
07:07:28,050 --> 07:07:30,830
Like, the second last phase is fucking canny as shit.

7710
07:07:33,130 --> 07:07:35,530
Yeah, the spin is so much worse.

7711
07:07:39,480 --> 07:07:41,600
This is just like...

7712
07:07:41,600 --> 07:07:41,780
Ah!

7713
07:07:43,820 --> 07:07:45,700
We should bottom up you up.

7714
07:07:53,450 --> 07:07:56,050
His face expands to eat the door.

7715
07:08:04,270 --> 07:08:04,830
Alright.

7716
07:08:04,830 --> 07:08:06,530
Alright, this is the final countdown.

7717
07:08:06,710 --> 07:08:07,450
Tigger, I got you.

7718
07:08:07,810 --> 07:08:07,990
Huh?

7719
07:08:09,050 --> 07:08:10,310
What the fuck?

7720
07:08:12,510 --> 07:08:14,110
What happened to him?

7721
07:08:14,670 --> 07:08:16,230
What happened to him?

7722
07:08:19,770 --> 07:08:22,610
Does he show up in the game like that too?

7723
07:08:23,570 --> 07:08:25,970
Oh no, it was just a cutscene.

7724
07:08:27,790 --> 07:08:29,350
What did you do, Piglet?

7725
07:08:30,710 --> 07:08:31,270
What?

7726
07:08:33,090 --> 07:08:35,110
Oh, he changes it.

7727
07:08:41,530 --> 07:08:42,590
Okay, that's annoying.

7728
07:08:44,150 --> 07:08:44,950
How many does it take?

7729
07:08:46,670 --> 07:08:47,070
What?

7730
07:08:51,370 --> 07:08:52,470
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

7731
07:08:52,550 --> 07:08:53,250
Oh, I got it.

7732
07:08:53,450 --> 07:08:53,970
It's three.

7733
07:08:54,070 --> 07:08:54,850
It has to be three.

7734
07:09:02,160 --> 07:09:04,220
There's three of them too!

7735
07:09:06,400 --> 07:09:07,980
Oh my god, get these weasels out of here.

7736
07:09:10,320 --> 07:09:11,020
Alright, nice.

7737
07:09:11,120 --> 07:09:11,320
Okay.

7738
07:09:17,340 --> 07:09:18,240
Okay, that's fine.

7739
07:09:18,780 --> 07:09:21,440
That's fine, because I need the double...

7740
07:09:21,440 --> 07:09:22,400
Okay, I need a number.

7741
07:09:26,020 --> 07:09:28,580
Okay, and then I leave.

7742
07:09:28,620 --> 07:09:29,100
I run.

7743
07:09:29,900 --> 07:09:30,600
I run!

7744
07:09:31,660 --> 07:09:32,940
Get out, get out, get out!

7745
07:09:32,940 --> 07:09:35,060
I have to give more distance.

7746
07:09:35,480 --> 07:09:36,060
Run!

7747
07:09:41,240 --> 07:09:42,260
Nice, okay.

7748
07:09:48,800 --> 07:09:49,820
Nice, okay.

7749
07:09:50,000 --> 07:09:51,360
The double square really helps.

7750
07:09:52,380 --> 07:09:54,540
That's right, you ended up helping me!

7751
07:09:55,160 --> 07:09:55,820
You idiot!

7752
07:09:57,300 --> 07:09:58,920
That was helpful!

7753
07:10:00,200 --> 07:10:00,940
Look at me.

7754
07:10:02,240 --> 07:10:03,620
Look at me!

7755
07:10:05,060 --> 07:10:06,800
That's what you write, look at me!

7756
07:10:10,040 --> 07:10:11,720
Okay, that's enough space then.

7757
07:10:11,800 --> 07:10:12,860
I should be able to get that.

7758
07:10:14,300 --> 07:10:15,940
Okay, that is plenty of space.

7759
07:10:17,980 --> 07:10:20,320
Oh, he changes the arrows too!

7760
07:10:25,500 --> 07:10:26,200
Oh, fuck.

7761
07:10:26,660 --> 07:10:27,600
Oh, nice.

7762
07:10:28,100 --> 07:10:29,060
The double triangle.

7763
07:10:34,380 --> 07:10:35,720
Okay, that's convenient.

7764
07:10:36,720 --> 07:10:40,060
Thank you, you actually made this easier for me, you fucking idiot!

7765
07:10:43,060 --> 07:10:45,140
Oh, okay, I need to grab the last one.

7766
07:10:45,200 --> 07:10:46,940
I almost forgot to grab the last potion.

7767
07:10:51,440 --> 07:10:51,960
Tigger!

7768
07:10:54,960 --> 07:10:56,140
Oh my god.

7769
07:10:56,780 --> 07:10:58,320
I'd rather just burn these.

7770
07:10:58,660 --> 07:11:01,500
I get so fucking uncanny!

7771
07:11:06,040 --> 07:11:07,940
Oh, Tigger, where have you been?

7772
07:11:08,660 --> 07:11:11,140
I got all surrounded by Woozles, see?

7773
07:11:11,540 --> 07:11:16,200
So, I bounced in here to think of a plan for getting past them.

7774
07:11:16,620 --> 07:11:17,740
Oh my god, you did it!

7775
07:11:18,360 --> 07:11:19,800
This place is Woozle-free!

7776
07:11:20,340 --> 07:11:27,100
You know, pale and all, pal, I think that you might be just almost as brave as a Tigger!

7777
07:11:27,620 --> 07:11:28,020
Almost?

7778
07:11:28,480 --> 07:11:30,440
You really think so?

7779
07:11:30,600 --> 07:11:33,720
Oh my god, almost perfect just like him!

7780
07:11:36,840 --> 07:11:39,960
And so it was, that thanks to his dream...

7781
07:11:39,960 --> 07:11:40,720
We did it!

7782
07:11:40,760 --> 07:11:46,820
Even if his friend Piglet did not look like a Tigger, he certainly had the courage and strength of one.

7783
07:11:48,260 --> 07:11:50,320
Oh my god, we fucking did it!

7784
07:11:53,500 --> 07:11:58,120
I'm back to being my same old self, with all my Tiggerific strengths!

7785
07:11:58,220 --> 07:11:59,920
And a safe to you, Piglet!

7786
07:12:02,000 --> 07:12:05,580
We made everybody... we made them all love us!

7787
07:12:06,980 --> 07:12:09,140
And they're all gonna wake up and be like...

7788
07:12:09,140 --> 07:12:10,600
Oh my god, it's crazy!

7789
07:12:10,960 --> 07:12:12,540
We had dreams about you!

7790
07:12:13,100 --> 07:12:14,960
Oh, that's so sad, Eeyore!

7791
07:12:15,440 --> 07:12:17,080
But it's okay, he's happy now!

7792
07:12:22,500 --> 07:12:22,960
Oh,

7793
07:12:27,380 --> 07:12:28,360
they're gonna drown!

7794
07:12:32,160 --> 07:12:35,400
Piglet, if you don't do anything, they'll all fucking drown!

7795
07:12:35,760 --> 07:12:37,200
Jesus Christ!

7796
07:12:38,360 --> 07:12:39,100
Wait, what?

7797
07:12:39,220 --> 07:12:40,000
It's not over?

7798
07:12:42,440 --> 07:12:43,760
Wait, wait!

7799
07:12:44,520 --> 07:12:45,640
Silly Doki!

7800
07:12:46,580 --> 07:12:48,120
Of course it's not over!

7801
07:12:48,640 --> 07:12:51,120
You have one more level to go!

7802
07:12:57,340 --> 07:12:58,000
Wait...

7803
07:13:02,280 --> 07:13:02,920
Wait...

7804
07:13:04,040 --> 07:13:04,680
What?

7805
07:13:07,800 --> 07:13:10,300
You wanna be a real hero?

7806
07:13:11,460 --> 07:13:12,880
Wait, what's gonna happen?

7807
07:13:17,210 --> 07:13:19,330
Wait, but I'm not... I'm not a dream!

7808
07:13:19,670 --> 07:13:21,110
I can die in reality!

7809
07:13:32,510 --> 07:13:34,230
Wait, they're real?

7810
07:13:38,830 --> 07:13:42,210
You mean to tell me they weren't part of my dreams?

7811
07:13:49,620 --> 07:13:50,800
They're real?

7812
07:14:01,890 --> 07:14:02,810
Oh shit!

7813
07:14:06,910 --> 07:14:07,750
Wait...

7814
07:14:11,130 --> 07:14:12,310
What am I supposed to do with these?

7815
07:14:22,130 --> 07:14:23,390
Wait, I got your memory!

7816
07:14:29,350 --> 07:14:30,250
Owl, look!

7817
07:14:31,430 --> 07:14:32,470
Do you remember?

7818
07:14:53,230 --> 07:14:54,470
What?

7819
07:14:54,470 --> 07:14:54,790
Just fly!

7820
07:15:00,670 --> 07:15:03,130
What the fuck?!

7821
07:15:03,130 --> 07:15:04,170
Just fly!

7822
07:15:13,810 --> 07:15:14,930
Without me?!

7823
07:15:14,930 --> 07:15:17,510
You're a fucking freak!

7824
07:15:18,910 --> 07:15:19,890
Stupid owl!

7825
07:15:21,490 --> 07:15:22,090
Just fly!

7826
07:15:22,230 --> 07:15:23,390
Oh, guess he's gone!

7827
07:15:23,570 --> 07:15:23,730
Bye!

7828
07:15:24,730 --> 07:15:27,190
Hey owl, you wanna help our friends out?

7829
07:15:27,350 --> 07:15:29,230
And you know, I don't fucking know...

7830
07:15:30,050 --> 07:15:32,830
Owl, don't you wanna help our friends out right now?

7831
07:15:36,730 --> 07:15:38,530
Crow forgot to fly!

7832
07:15:39,090 --> 07:15:40,190
And then he flew away!

7833
07:15:42,610 --> 07:15:43,590
I saved him!

7834
07:15:43,850 --> 07:15:44,950
I saved him!

7835
07:15:46,010 --> 07:15:50,670
Okay, the worst part is that he just fucking flew away right after.

7836
07:15:51,450 --> 07:15:53,050
Our friends are gonna die!

7837
07:15:55,090 --> 07:15:56,190
He's just like, well...

7838
07:16:00,230 --> 07:16:01,710
Me, thank you for the super chat!

7839
07:16:03,490 --> 07:16:04,710
Run, run, run, run, run, run!

7840
07:16:04,950 --> 07:16:06,290
You mean it didn't take too long?

7841
07:16:06,290 --> 07:16:07,270
Oh my god, run, run, run!

7842
07:16:07,310 --> 07:16:08,530
I'm sorry Pooh Bear, don't look!

7843
07:16:08,590 --> 07:16:09,550
Don't look, close your eyes!

7844
07:16:19,810 --> 07:16:20,210
Okay...

7845
07:16:20,990 --> 07:16:22,070
That's what I'm saying!

7846
07:16:22,190 --> 07:16:23,950
He's supposed to be the smartest one!

7847
07:16:25,290 --> 07:16:26,750
Oh my god, it takes three?

7848
07:16:27,090 --> 07:16:28,030
Me, thank you for the super chat!

7849
07:16:28,130 --> 07:16:28,970
Thank you, thank you!

7850
07:16:29,190 --> 07:16:31,270
How many game-breaking bugs did I miss?

7851
07:16:31,530 --> 07:16:34,730
There wasn't a lot, I think our biggest one was the beginning.

7852
07:16:35,770 --> 07:16:36,590
I did it, Pooh!

7853
07:16:38,130 --> 07:16:39,790
Oh, he just walks over!

7854
07:16:43,460 --> 07:16:44,720
He could've done that!

7855
07:16:44,720 --> 07:16:47,320
With the health lumps chasing after him!

7856
07:16:56,420 --> 07:16:58,180
Walking him by!

7857
07:17:03,550 --> 07:17:05,430
Wait, that's so shallow!

7858
07:17:06,410 --> 07:17:10,330
Wait, I just realized how shallow the water was!

7859
07:17:10,790 --> 07:17:12,170
Wait a minute!

7860
07:17:15,550 --> 07:17:16,370
Like it was...

7861
07:17:21,190 --> 07:17:23,250
Do I even need a bridge at that point?

7862
07:17:26,290 --> 07:17:27,030
Bite me!

7863
07:17:27,930 --> 07:17:29,150
Bite me, you fucker!

7864
07:17:30,710 --> 07:17:31,550
Bite me!

7865
07:17:44,180 --> 07:17:45,080
That's fucking right!

7866
07:17:46,700 --> 07:17:47,860
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

7867
07:17:50,560 --> 07:17:52,200
I hate that it takes three!

7868
07:17:53,660 --> 07:17:55,580
So I have to like...

7869
07:17:55,580 --> 07:17:57,140
Oh my God, no!

7870
07:17:58,000 --> 07:18:01,060
No, where's Christopher Robin when I need him?

7871
07:18:03,780 --> 07:18:07,080
Where is he when I need him to tell me to stop being sad?

7872
07:18:09,820 --> 07:18:10,460
Okay.

7873
07:18:13,880 --> 07:18:15,800
No, no, are you serious?

7874
07:18:16,360 --> 07:18:16,780
No!

7875
07:18:18,840 --> 07:18:21,280
Put the lump extra off right now.

7876
07:18:22,300 --> 07:18:22,820
Oh no.

7877
07:18:23,560 --> 07:18:26,800
Oh no, if I can die in real life!

7878
07:18:30,080 --> 07:18:30,880
Oh no.

7879
07:18:32,020 --> 07:18:32,460
Okay.

7880
07:18:33,020 --> 07:18:34,320
Okay, I can do it.

7881
07:18:35,620 --> 07:18:37,560
I can do it, I can get like coverage.

7882
07:18:39,240 --> 07:18:40,660
Alright, now this is fine.

7883
07:18:40,760 --> 07:18:41,900
This is so fast!

7884
07:18:42,840 --> 07:18:44,540
He's so fast too!

7885
07:18:53,870 --> 07:18:54,770
Oh, no, no, no!

7886
07:18:54,910 --> 07:18:55,870
I just made it!

7887
07:18:56,070 --> 07:18:56,930
I just made it!

7888
07:19:00,930 --> 07:19:02,950
Oh my God, 1 HP.

7889
07:19:03,930 --> 07:19:04,510
Alright, Rue.

7890
07:19:05,170 --> 07:19:08,550
I swear to God, if you jump over, I swear to fucking God.

7891
07:19:08,830 --> 07:19:10,150
Oh wait, we have a bridge.

7892
07:19:10,350 --> 07:19:11,670
We have a bridge, thank God.

7893
07:19:11,810 --> 07:19:11,950
Okay.

7894
07:19:16,060 --> 07:19:18,420
We have a bridge, he can't just jump over at least.

7895
07:19:31,250 --> 07:19:32,170
Okay, okay.

7896
07:19:34,190 --> 07:19:35,890
That's my loading screen.

7897
07:19:36,890 --> 07:19:38,430
It's like they're gonna get me.

7898
07:19:43,600 --> 07:19:44,650
You alright?

7899
07:19:46,910 --> 07:19:49,270
Oh shit, I forgot about my other friends.

7900
07:19:56,750 --> 07:19:57,370
Oh my God.

7901
07:19:59,550 --> 07:20:00,790
I hate him.

7902
07:20:01,150 --> 07:20:03,030
I hate him so much.

7903
07:20:05,530 --> 07:20:06,490
I hate him.

7904
07:20:08,410 --> 07:20:08,670
Okay, okay.

7905
07:20:11,470 --> 07:20:12,810
Piglet, please.

7906
07:20:13,310 --> 07:20:14,410
He's just there.

7907
07:20:15,010 --> 07:20:16,570
Piglet, who would you choose?

7908
07:20:17,150 --> 07:20:19,470
Who would you possibly choose?

7909
07:20:25,530 --> 07:20:29,430
No, no, not Gambler, man.

7910
07:20:32,860 --> 07:20:33,700
No!

7911
07:20:38,060 --> 07:20:38,720
No!

7912
07:20:39,340 --> 07:20:41,820
Not Gambler, man!

7913
07:20:50,850 --> 07:20:52,670
Anyway, what do I do?

7914
07:20:53,610 --> 07:20:54,250
It'll be fine.

7915
07:20:54,370 --> 07:20:54,950
Who cares?

7916
07:20:55,110 --> 07:20:55,790
It'll be okay.

7917
07:20:56,870 --> 07:20:57,830
It'll be fine.

7918
07:20:58,390 --> 07:21:00,870
Let's just deal with him first.

7919
07:21:03,570 --> 07:21:05,810
Oh no, not Gambler, man.

7920
07:21:10,250 --> 07:21:11,130
Okay, nice.

7921
07:21:12,030 --> 07:21:15,530
I think what I don't like is the fact that it takes three tries now.

7922
07:21:18,710 --> 07:21:19,210
Okay.

7923
07:21:22,970 --> 07:21:26,790
I don't trust myself for this, so I'm just gonna make sure...

7924
07:21:27,310 --> 07:21:28,330
What the fuck?

7925
07:21:28,450 --> 07:21:29,370
He just starts running!

7926
07:21:29,970 --> 07:21:31,190
Tigger, just give me a sec.

7927
07:21:31,530 --> 07:21:32,470
Just give me a sec.

7928
07:21:32,570 --> 07:21:33,570
I got one more try.

7929
07:21:36,350 --> 07:21:37,790
I literally have one HP.

7930
07:21:38,430 --> 07:21:40,290
I forgot I had, like, other friends.

7931
07:21:40,410 --> 07:21:42,890
I thought it was over when I saved three people.

7932
07:21:48,820 --> 07:21:49,540
Upside down!

7933
07:21:49,620 --> 07:21:50,960
Thank you for the one-gifted ships!

7934
07:21:51,080 --> 07:21:51,980
Thank you, thank you!

7935
07:21:58,300 --> 07:22:00,160
Alright, Tigger, you're free now.

7936
07:22:02,680 --> 07:22:05,180
Oh, thank you, big little pal!

7937
07:22:05,840 --> 07:22:08,200
You're just a lifesaver, a hero!

7938
07:22:08,920 --> 07:22:11,280
You got me out of that flood, and buddy...

7939
07:22:11,960 --> 07:22:15,540
I think it's time to lose, like, a friend or two, and we know which friend it is.

7940
07:22:18,080 --> 07:22:18,520
Yay!

7941
07:22:18,520 --> 07:22:19,480
We did it!

7942
07:22:19,480 --> 07:22:20,520
We saved him!

7943
07:22:21,880 --> 07:22:25,040
Okay, and then we gotta get the carrot here.

7944
07:22:26,220 --> 07:22:29,080
I think, like, if I put the carrot in here...

7945
07:22:30,520 --> 07:22:32,080
Then it's gonna...

7946
07:22:33,580 --> 07:22:35,400
It's gonna cause it to fall, right?

7947
07:22:35,520 --> 07:22:35,820
Yeah.

7948
07:22:38,240 --> 07:22:41,060
Hey, we lost our entire harvest, but that's okay.

7949
07:22:44,180 --> 07:22:45,160
Where's the gamba?

7950
07:22:47,080 --> 07:22:48,040
Gamba man?

7951
07:22:49,740 --> 07:22:51,400
Gamba man, I see you.

7952
07:22:52,060 --> 07:22:54,120
Oh no, it's Gamba Man.

7953
07:22:55,020 --> 07:22:57,420
Oh my god, I hate Gamba Man the most.

7954
07:22:57,420 --> 07:22:59,300
I hate him, I hate him so much.

7955
07:23:02,560 --> 07:23:04,020
Oh my god, really?

7956
07:23:06,780 --> 07:23:07,180
Really?!

7957
07:23:08,680 --> 07:23:09,940
I hate you!

7958
07:23:11,560 --> 07:23:12,920
Oh, there's no way.

7959
07:23:13,020 --> 07:23:14,020
The thing is, I can't.

7960
07:23:14,140 --> 07:23:15,060
I need to run.

7961
07:23:16,040 --> 07:23:17,100
This is your fault, rabbit!

7962
07:23:23,390 --> 07:23:23,790
Okay.

7963
07:23:24,970 --> 07:23:26,730
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

7964
07:23:26,730 --> 07:23:27,590
How did I leave it?!

7965
07:23:30,650 --> 07:23:32,790
I can't risk it, I'm literally 1 HP.

7966
07:23:37,710 --> 07:23:38,270
I...

7967
07:23:39,890 --> 07:23:44,210
I think the worst part is that I picked the wrong ones.

7968
07:23:46,930 --> 07:23:50,170
The worst part is that I keep picking the wrong ones too.

7969
07:23:50,830 --> 07:23:52,710
It's not like... no.

7970
07:23:54,490 --> 07:23:56,610
Are you serious?!

7971
07:23:56,610 --> 07:23:57,650
I didn't...

7972
07:24:05,190 --> 07:24:07,950
I just died!

7973
07:24:12,990 --> 07:24:15,330
That's a thing?!

7974
07:24:15,330 --> 07:24:16,450
Oh, he's dead.

7975
07:24:17,590 --> 07:24:20,730
Well, I guess he's...

7976
07:24:24,330 --> 07:24:25,690
I...

7977
07:24:25,690 --> 07:24:27,630
I'm totally kidding!

7978
07:24:28,770 --> 07:24:30,010
No way!

7979
07:24:31,910 --> 07:24:33,270
No way!

7980
07:24:34,270 --> 07:24:36,970
I pick up... I hate him!

7981
07:24:39,150 --> 07:24:41,010
I hate him!

7982
07:24:41,270 --> 07:24:42,030
I hate him!

7983
07:24:42,130 --> 07:24:42,850
I hate him!

7984
07:24:42,950 --> 07:24:44,730
I hate him so much!

7985
07:24:45,290 --> 07:24:47,450
Oh my god, I hate him!

7986
07:24:47,930 --> 07:24:50,730
I hate him so much!

7987
07:24:51,550 --> 07:24:52,410
I hate him!

7988
07:24:53,130 --> 07:24:54,470
Oh my god!

7989
07:24:54,950 --> 07:24:56,590
Stupid rabbit!

7990
07:24:57,750 --> 07:25:01,090
Naturally stupid fucking rabbit!

7991
07:25:03,890 --> 07:25:06,690
Rabbit claims another victim.

7992
07:25:08,150 --> 07:25:10,690
We were so close!

7993
07:25:11,210 --> 07:25:14,090
How was I supposed to know he didn't fucking...

7994
07:25:14,090 --> 07:25:15,170
He dies!

7995
07:25:15,450 --> 07:25:16,970
He just dies!

7996
07:25:19,670 --> 07:25:20,470
Like...

7997
07:25:21,270 --> 07:25:21,830
Like...

7998
07:25:25,690 --> 07:25:27,270
Oh my god.

7999
07:25:28,650 --> 07:25:30,990
I can't believe he just dies.

8000
07:25:31,210 --> 07:25:34,050
It's just like, whoop, he's dead now.

8001
07:25:38,920 --> 07:25:39,480
Okay.

8002
07:25:40,820 --> 07:25:42,500
Alright, then we grab this.

8003
07:25:46,980 --> 07:25:48,720
Alright, we skip all of this.

8004
07:25:49,780 --> 07:25:50,960
Kick it, Piglet!

8005
07:25:51,060 --> 07:25:52,220
Please, we're so close!

8006
07:25:52,920 --> 07:25:54,020
It's cause of the bee!

8007
07:25:57,980 --> 07:26:00,060
The bee was so difficult!

8008
07:26:02,120 --> 07:26:03,680
He's so fast!

8009
07:26:09,240 --> 07:26:12,860
Oh my god, if I exit that dream, I swear to god, I was gonna fucking...

8010
07:26:12,860 --> 07:26:16,320
Oh my god, if I accidentally exit that dream...

8011
07:26:17,720 --> 07:26:20,960
Okay, I'm not taking chances.

8012
07:26:21,160 --> 07:26:21,920
I'm not...

8013
07:26:21,920 --> 07:26:23,600
Guys, I'm not taking chances.

8014
07:26:23,700 --> 07:26:25,580
Guys, I've gone through so much.

8015
07:26:28,260 --> 07:26:29,600
Okay, that should be enough.

8016
07:26:35,290 --> 07:26:36,430
No, no, no, no, no!

8017
07:26:36,750 --> 07:26:36,990
I

8018
07:26:41,050 --> 07:26:41,470
hate him!

8019
07:26:41,510 --> 07:26:42,490
I hate him!

8020
07:26:43,050 --> 07:26:44,390
I hate this!

8021
07:26:44,390 --> 07:26:47,670
Oh my god, I hate him!

8022
07:26:47,910 --> 07:26:50,950
I hate him so much!

8023
07:26:59,640 --> 07:27:00,800
Oh my god, he's dead.

8024
07:27:02,840 --> 07:27:04,140
He's fucking dead.

8025
07:27:07,360 --> 07:27:08,300
Stupid bee.

8026
07:27:09,440 --> 07:27:12,760
At least Owl, I don't have to fight him, actually.

8027
07:27:13,000 --> 07:27:15,560
This sucks, cause I'm on the... I'm at the second stage.

8028
07:27:16,260 --> 07:27:18,640
In the second stage, I'm just like, slower.

8029
07:27:20,500 --> 07:27:21,380
Just fly.

8030
07:27:21,860 --> 07:27:23,200
Just fucking fly.

8031
07:27:29,090 --> 07:27:30,090
Just fly.

8032
07:27:30,290 --> 07:27:31,190
It's that easy.

8033
07:27:36,320 --> 07:27:38,300
Okay, I'm just a little afraid.

8034
07:27:39,980 --> 07:27:41,800
Okay, it's figure time.

8035
07:27:44,280 --> 07:27:46,480
Nice, and then...

8036
07:27:46,480 --> 07:27:48,280
Oh my god, please Piglet, please!

8037
07:27:48,560 --> 07:27:51,060
I just need you to grab the brush!

8038
07:27:53,520 --> 07:27:54,040
Okay.

8039
07:27:55,460 --> 07:27:58,620
This is gonna be difficult, cause Mirror Man is the one after.

8040
07:28:03,440 --> 07:28:06,820
I... I hate... I hate Rabbit.

8041
07:28:07,040 --> 07:28:09,380
I feel like Rabbit's gonna be the death of me again.

8042
07:28:10,200 --> 07:28:10,560
Oh.

8043
07:28:11,640 --> 07:28:13,600
I think Rabbit's gonna kill me again.

8044
07:28:13,780 --> 07:28:17,060
I... I just have this feeling that...

8045
07:28:19,420 --> 07:28:20,400
I don't know.

8046
07:28:20,400 --> 07:28:24,680
Just this feeling that Rabbit's gonna fuck me over yet again.

8047
07:28:27,970 --> 07:28:29,210
Oh, thank god.

8048
07:28:29,810 --> 07:28:31,770
Thank god he goes really slow.

8049
07:28:32,830 --> 07:28:33,650
The Gamma Man.

8050
07:28:34,170 --> 07:28:35,650
He's gonna come over.

8051
07:28:35,810 --> 07:28:37,230
He's gonna come over.

8052
07:28:37,410 --> 07:28:38,010
Gamma Man.

8053
07:28:38,030 --> 07:28:39,730
I can feel the Gamma Man.

8054
07:28:43,170 --> 07:28:43,850
Okay.

8055
07:28:47,970 --> 07:28:49,850
Gamma Man time!

8056
07:28:52,690 --> 07:28:53,810
Gamma time!

8057
07:28:55,130 --> 07:28:56,650
It's Gamma time!

8058
07:28:56,750 --> 07:29:00,150
Oh my god, please don't fucking stutter here.

8059
07:29:02,630 --> 07:29:03,190
Alright.

8060
07:29:04,550 --> 07:29:05,670
Hey Gamma.

8061
07:29:09,200 --> 07:29:11,180
Can't believe we're not supposed to lead him.

8062
07:29:11,460 --> 07:29:12,940
This is like... it's so dumb.

8063
07:29:14,000 --> 07:29:14,520
Get over here.

8064
07:29:16,680 --> 07:29:19,220
Okay, I don't have a lot here.

8065
07:29:19,540 --> 07:29:21,660
I gotta make sure he doesn't go to Rabbit.

8066
07:29:21,660 --> 07:29:23,400
I gotta...

8067
07:29:27,110 --> 07:29:27,870
Really?

8068
07:29:28,610 --> 07:29:29,370
Okay.

8069
07:29:31,130 --> 07:29:31,890
Alright.

8070
07:29:32,330 --> 07:29:32,710
Run.

8071
07:29:33,290 --> 07:29:33,670
Run.

8072
07:29:34,310 --> 07:29:36,150
Run, stupid Gamma.

8073
07:29:36,270 --> 07:29:37,290
Stupid Gamma.

8074
07:29:37,670 --> 07:29:39,250
I fucking hate you.

8075
07:29:39,350 --> 07:29:40,450
I hate you so much.

8076
07:29:41,150 --> 07:29:42,990
I hate you so much.

8077
07:29:43,010 --> 07:29:43,850
I hate you.

8078
07:29:44,170 --> 07:29:45,650
I hate you!

8079
07:29:45,650 --> 07:29:45,750
I hate you!

8080
07:29:51,770 --> 07:29:54,510
I hate you so much.

8081
07:29:55,290 --> 07:29:58,930
The worst part is, it's like...

8082
07:29:59,650 --> 07:30:02,270
It's like, I have to do so much for this face!

8083
07:30:08,630 --> 07:30:09,810
No, run!

8084
07:30:17,490 --> 07:30:19,930
I just gotta be lucky!

8085
07:30:22,650 --> 07:30:23,850
Stop laughing!

8086
07:30:31,790 --> 07:30:33,190
Okay.

8087
07:30:36,250 --> 07:30:38,650
Okay, Elephant Man.

8088
07:30:39,770 --> 07:30:41,270
Elephant Man.

8089
07:30:42,530 --> 07:30:44,370
Elephant Man.

8090
07:30:45,370 --> 07:30:46,470
Elephant Man, please.

8091
07:30:46,630 --> 07:30:47,650
Don't get near Rabbit.

8092
07:30:47,810 --> 07:30:49,270
Please, I can't do this again.

8093
07:30:52,990 --> 07:30:53,370
Okay.

8094
07:30:54,590 --> 07:30:55,890
I can do two, I think.

8095
07:30:55,930 --> 07:30:56,730
I can fit two in.

8096
07:30:56,790 --> 07:30:57,770
I think I can fit two in.

8097
07:31:00,370 --> 07:31:01,890
Yeah, I can fit two in.

8098
07:31:02,170 --> 07:31:03,790
If I'm green... I think I can fit three in.

8099
07:31:04,390 --> 07:31:05,470
I think I can do it.

8100
07:31:07,810 --> 07:31:08,190
Yes!

8101
07:31:08,550 --> 07:31:08,790
Three!

8102
07:31:10,830 --> 07:31:12,910
Okay, it's just Gamma.

8103
07:31:13,410 --> 07:31:14,530
It was just a Gamma.

8104
07:31:15,710 --> 07:31:16,110
Three.

8105
07:31:17,750 --> 07:31:19,290
Okay, Rabbit, you're free now.

8106
07:31:22,810 --> 07:31:24,110
You're welcome.

8107
07:31:27,530 --> 07:31:28,050
Ugh.

8108
07:31:36,410 --> 07:31:39,130
Oh my god, you still care about the carrots?

8109
07:31:40,050 --> 07:31:40,470
Piglet, don't.

8110
07:31:40,490 --> 07:31:41,330
Piglet, don't smile.

8111
07:31:42,090 --> 07:31:43,870
He's taking advantage of you.

8112
07:31:44,830 --> 07:31:47,110
He's taking advantage of you, Piglet.

8113
07:31:47,170 --> 07:31:49,450
Don't let your... Don't be a fucking fool.

8114
07:31:50,210 --> 07:31:52,690
Alright, Eeyore, I'm coming over, Eeyore.

8115
07:31:54,110 --> 07:31:58,590
If I die to Eeyore, of all things, I'm...

8116
07:32:01,870 --> 07:32:07,190
If I die to Eeyore, I'm just... I don't know what I'm gonna do.

8117
07:32:15,390 --> 07:32:16,950
I'm just a mirror guy.

8118
07:32:17,050 --> 07:32:18,810
He's really scary, too.

8119
07:32:22,870 --> 07:32:23,530
Hello?

8120
07:32:29,890 --> 07:32:30,970
Oh no.

8121
07:32:35,720 --> 07:32:36,660
Nice, okay.

8122
07:32:37,940 --> 07:32:39,060
How far is he?

8123
07:32:39,120 --> 07:32:39,940
How far is he?

8124
07:32:43,380 --> 07:32:45,880
Okay, we're gonna... Yeah, I'm not gonna risk that.

8125
07:32:45,960 --> 07:32:46,900
That's weird.

8126
07:32:48,680 --> 07:32:50,860
It seems way too close.

8127
07:32:51,000 --> 07:32:53,100
It seems way too close.

8128
07:32:56,020 --> 07:32:56,960
Oh no.

8129
07:32:57,860 --> 07:32:59,660
Oh no, I can't.

8130
07:32:59,940 --> 07:33:00,680
Oh no.

8131
07:33:02,760 --> 07:33:04,600
Okay, got that.

8132
07:33:07,660 --> 07:33:08,100
Can I fit?

8133
07:33:08,160 --> 07:33:09,320
No, I don't trust myself.

8134
07:33:10,420 --> 07:33:11,880
I don't think I can fit.

8135
07:33:12,160 --> 07:33:12,580
No!

8136
07:33:13,080 --> 07:33:14,440
Why are you walking?

8137
07:33:17,460 --> 07:33:18,860
No, Piglet!

8138
07:33:24,150 --> 07:33:26,530
Piglet, why you walk?

8139
07:33:26,730 --> 07:33:27,270
Piglet!

8140
07:33:28,250 --> 07:33:29,610
No way!

8141
07:33:29,910 --> 07:33:31,850
He had to walk.

8142
07:33:35,030 --> 07:33:36,050
Wait, what?

8143
07:33:38,430 --> 07:33:39,770
No, I can't see.

8144
07:33:40,110 --> 07:33:41,610
I can't register it.

8145
07:33:41,710 --> 07:33:44,670
I'm so... I can't register it!

8146
07:33:44,770 --> 07:33:45,430
I'm panicking!

8147
07:33:46,330 --> 07:33:47,650
I hate this!

8148
07:33:51,790 --> 07:33:52,390
No.

8149
07:33:55,230 --> 07:33:56,430
Oh, we did it!

8150
07:33:56,550 --> 07:33:57,450
That has to be three, right?

8151
07:34:00,670 --> 07:34:01,150
Okay.

8152
07:34:01,150 --> 07:34:01,150
Yes!

8153
07:34:02,290 --> 07:34:03,390
I can't!

8154
07:34:03,390 --> 07:34:05,250
I can't read upside down!

8155
07:34:11,630 --> 07:34:12,770
It's okay, Eeyore.

8156
07:34:13,010 --> 07:34:16,450
I already had to deal with Rabbid.

8157
07:34:16,530 --> 07:34:17,130
It's okay.

8158
07:34:28,920 --> 07:34:30,400
Oh my god, did we do it?

8159
07:34:30,800 --> 07:34:32,180
I don't have any friends left, right?

8160
07:34:34,460 --> 07:34:35,720
Did we do it?

8161
07:34:35,800 --> 07:34:35,840
Did we do it?

8162
07:34:35,840 --> 07:34:37,380
There's no more friends left, right?

8163
07:34:38,260 --> 07:34:38,860
Yeah!

8164
07:34:40,140 --> 07:34:40,640
Oh, what?

8165
07:34:40,960 --> 07:34:41,700
What's going on?

8166
07:34:42,280 --> 07:34:44,040
There is a boss?

8167
07:34:47,120 --> 07:34:47,720
No.

8168
07:34:49,080 --> 07:34:50,380
There's no way.

8169
07:34:50,900 --> 07:34:51,900
There's no way.

8170
07:34:52,080 --> 07:34:52,880
There's no way.

8171
07:34:53,020 --> 07:34:54,420
If I... There's no way.

8172
07:34:54,720 --> 07:34:56,580
There's no fucking way.

8173
07:34:58,340 --> 07:35:00,260
There's no fucking way.

8174
07:35:05,090 --> 07:35:06,010
There's no way.

8175
07:35:06,390 --> 07:35:07,490
There's no way.

8176
07:35:09,610 --> 07:35:12,210
The worst part is I have to do this in three tries.

8177
07:35:16,890 --> 07:35:17,890
No, no, no, no, no.

8178
07:35:18,230 --> 07:35:20,270
No, there's... I have to do this in three tries!

8179
07:35:27,110 --> 07:35:31,290
Oh my god, they're doing... Oh my god, this is... That's so much pressure!

8180
07:35:31,890 --> 07:35:33,110
Are you serious?

8181
07:35:33,110 --> 07:35:33,490
Oh!

8182
07:35:36,470 --> 07:35:39,970
Oh, to do that!

8183
07:35:40,290 --> 07:35:42,310
How are children supposed to do that?

8184
07:35:47,390 --> 07:35:49,010
Oh my god.

8185
07:35:52,530 --> 07:35:55,450
Children were... Children never made it to the end.

8186
07:35:58,350 --> 07:36:00,030
Oh, Chrissy comes after.

8187
07:36:01,770 --> 07:36:02,990
Where have I been?

8188
07:36:06,390 --> 07:36:09,090
Did nothing happen, Christopher Robin?

8189
07:36:23,150 --> 07:36:25,470
Thanks for nothing, Chris.

8190
07:36:25,610 --> 07:36:25,810
No.

8191
07:36:30,070 --> 07:36:32,550
All credit goes to Christopher Robin, of course.

8192
07:36:36,810 --> 07:36:38,130
Please, not cookies.

8193
07:36:42,750 --> 07:36:44,070
Did we just get a head pat?

8194
07:36:47,290 --> 07:36:47,930
That's it?

8195
07:36:49,730 --> 07:36:53,970
Did no one... Did they not acknowledge that I nearly saved 100 acres woods?

8196
07:36:56,310 --> 07:36:57,730
Oh my god, but we did it.

8197
07:36:57,870 --> 07:36:58,850
Oh my god.

8198
07:37:02,910 --> 07:37:04,770
We did it, guys.

8199
07:37:06,990 --> 07:37:13,190
We haven't had a one-off beating a game in one sitting in a long... Oh hey, Jim Cummings and Peter Collins.

8200
07:37:13,390 --> 07:37:14,130
See, there they are.

8201
07:37:14,950 --> 07:37:18,550
We haven't had a one-off beating a game in one go in a long time.

8202
07:37:19,370 --> 07:37:23,010
Oh my... There's no way a child would have fucking beat the last boss.

8203
07:37:23,090 --> 07:37:23,950
There's no way.

8204
07:37:24,250 --> 07:37:29,830
Like, I was tapping it as fast as I could, and I was already, like, this close to getting killed.

8205
07:37:30,030 --> 07:37:32,050
Like, there's no way.

8206
07:37:32,050 --> 07:37:34,990
I refuse to believe... Oh hey, that's me.

8207
07:37:35,510 --> 07:37:41,550
I refuse to believe a child got past the last boss.

8208
07:37:44,770 --> 07:37:46,450
Oh my god.

8209
07:37:47,690 --> 07:37:48,870
There's no way.

8210
07:37:53,330 --> 07:37:55,190
Oh my god.

8211
07:37:55,410 --> 07:37:56,530
Well, that was fun.

8212
07:37:56,610 --> 07:38:01,430
I'm glad to share you guys my childhood game that I never beat.

8213
07:38:01,430 --> 07:38:03,150
But I beat it now, guys.

8214
07:38:03,290 --> 07:38:06,310
The difference is that now I have adult reflexes.

8215
07:38:06,450 --> 07:38:10,290
And, like, I'm not... I play Silent Hill now, so I'm not scared of this game.

8216
07:38:12,090 --> 07:38:12,490
Recycling!

8217
07:38:12,670 --> 07:38:13,370
Thank you for the superchat.

8218
07:38:13,450 --> 07:38:14,130
Thank you, thank you.

8219
07:38:14,130 --> 07:38:15,210
You were all here, chat.

8220
07:38:15,610 --> 07:38:16,930
You were all here.

8221
07:38:17,230 --> 07:38:20,850
I'm most likely going to take tomorrow off because, like, my voice is dead.

8222
07:38:21,050 --> 07:38:25,990
But I will stream on Thursday and Friday and Saturday.

8223
07:38:26,310 --> 07:38:27,570
But I'll take Wednesday off.

8224
07:38:27,630 --> 07:38:28,970
I'm sorry for taking a lot of days off.

8225
07:38:28,970 --> 07:38:36,410
I'm trying to rest my voice a lot more because of my coughing and stuff and my, you know, trying to find a fucking doctor.

8226
07:38:37,210 --> 07:38:38,490
Thank you for the superchat.

8227
07:38:38,570 --> 07:38:39,550
Thank you, thank you.

8228
07:38:39,870 --> 07:38:42,070
Will there be more games in your PS2 in the future?

8229
07:38:42,170 --> 07:38:42,490
Maybe.

8230
07:38:42,910 --> 07:38:43,270
Maybe.

8231
07:38:48,010 --> 07:38:50,190
Realized, wow, I can play PS2 games now.

8232
07:38:50,410 --> 07:38:51,810
Thank you for the superchat.

8233
07:38:51,910 --> 07:38:52,990
Thank you, thank you.

8234
07:38:54,170 --> 07:38:55,430
Rage, thank you for the superchat.

8235
07:38:55,570 --> 07:38:56,330
Thank you, thank you.

8236
07:38:57,250 --> 07:39:01,470
I think you made it harder when switching to that last- YOU HAD TO HAVE THE LAST FACE!

8237
07:39:01,750 --> 07:39:03,610
YOU CAN'T SWAP FACES!

8238
07:39:04,030 --> 07:39:05,590
THAT'S THE WORST PART!

8239
07:39:06,110 --> 07:39:06,870
Thank you for the superchat.

8240
07:39:06,970 --> 07:39:08,090
Thank you, thank you.

8241
07:39:08,670 --> 07:39:09,910
Golden, thank you for the superchat.

8242
07:39:09,990 --> 07:39:10,770
Thank you, thank you.

8243
07:39:10,990 --> 07:39:12,430
I wanted to say I'm back and you're still here.

8244
07:39:12,530 --> 07:39:13,590
Go home, movie is over.

8245
07:39:13,710 --> 07:39:14,830
Yep, we finally did it.

8246
07:39:14,890 --> 07:39:15,430
Thank you for the superchat.

8247
07:39:15,550 --> 07:39:16,230
Thank you, thank you.

8248
07:39:16,530 --> 07:39:18,770
Jay, please- I'm trying my best.

8249
07:39:19,110 --> 07:39:20,490
I'm trying my best.

8250
07:39:20,670 --> 07:39:23,490
There's no doctors that want to see me.

8251
07:39:23,810 --> 07:39:25,030
Thank you for the superchat.

8252
07:39:25,130 --> 07:39:26,110
Thank you, thank you.

8253
07:39:26,330 --> 07:39:27,570
Derp, thank you for the superchat.

8254
07:39:27,630 --> 07:39:28,050
Thank you, thank you.

8255
07:39:28,190 --> 07:39:30,090
I told you one last job.

8256
07:39:30,230 --> 07:39:30,990
I knew it.

8257
07:39:31,330 --> 07:39:32,310
The one last job.

8258
07:39:32,430 --> 07:39:33,450
It was the last.

8259
07:39:33,850 --> 07:39:35,550
You'll never know where I live now.

8260
07:39:36,490 --> 07:39:39,790
Don Cookie Monster will never know where I go now.

8261
07:39:40,130 --> 07:39:40,970
Thank you for the superchat.

8262
07:39:41,070 --> 07:39:41,770
Derp, thank you, thank you.

8263
07:39:41,770 --> 07:39:42,950
Thank you everybody for watching!

8264
07:39:43,450 --> 07:39:44,470
I'm gonna head off now.

8265
07:39:44,610 --> 07:39:46,870
As always, everybody, stay hydrated.

8266
07:39:47,070 --> 07:39:47,570
Posture check.

8267
07:39:47,810 --> 07:39:49,330
Get up and move around to get that blood flow.

8268
07:39:49,510 --> 07:39:51,450
Oh my gosh, we just see Piglet's rump.

8269
07:39:52,770 --> 07:39:53,810
Get that blood flowing.

8270
07:39:53,930 --> 07:39:54,370
You stay up for me?

8271
07:39:54,490 --> 07:39:55,290
Head to bed, guys.

8272
07:39:55,430 --> 07:39:56,110
You deserve it.

8273
07:39:56,190 --> 07:39:57,450
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

8274
07:39:57,870 --> 07:39:58,630
Bye, guys.

8275
07:39:59,530 --> 07:39:59,850
Bye!
