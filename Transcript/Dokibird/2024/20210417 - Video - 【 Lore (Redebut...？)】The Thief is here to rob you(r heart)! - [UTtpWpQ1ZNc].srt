for those who don't know who I am and this is your first

97
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:48,090
time on the stream so so my name is actually Doki quotation
maple quotation bird yes first name Doki last name bird but

98
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:55,470
no no to be to be fair dokey bird is actually my thief name
so you know how like thieves don't put their real names in

99
00:07:55,470 --> 00:08:04,050
there because it's like you know that's how you get caught
so so i'm called my thief name is actually dokey bird but my

100
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:10,630
real name is maple or is it i mean i don't know i have like
200 passports i think this is my real name after looking

101
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:15,150
through like 200 of them i think this is the closest one to
my passport name.

102
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:17,710
It's been a while, guys.

103
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:23,290

which one's the real one.

104
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:24,710

is that i am also if you guys did not realize i am also an

133
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:25,150
artist because if you're wondering why do you why do you
take money for art can't you just rob people instead well

134
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:32,910
the thing is i'm giving like a little restriction on how
many times i can rob someone and i have to fall abide by the

135
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:40,410
terms of services from various banks and museums and we have
an agreement that i can only rob them like once a year so

136
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:48,550
because of that i have to i have to do an honest living and
do streaming and art uh because you know i spend too much

137
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:55,510
money on things sometimes and i realize oh i can't rob
anyone anymore because i i stole from everyone already uh to

138
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:59,410
wait for 2022 to do that um so now i have

139
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:14,310
suck i have to do honest work for money god damn he's trying
to carry rob this last week no more for the year that's

140
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:22,130
basically it every time i rob them we sign a contract and be
like remember can't rob us until next year i'm like all

141
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:32,610

145
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:09,070

159
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:00,930

They love to cause destruction and mischiefs maybe more than
me.

I don't know.

168
00:14:54,530 --> 00:15:00,130
Sometimes I come home and I see them with their own bags of
money and some of their own pets.

169
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,230
So I don't know what they're doing.

170
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:09,670
Sometimes they're on their own little adventures and i just
let them do whatever they want sometimes they tag along with

left all right some of the merch that i've made some of the

182
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:54,050

to go to conventions and sell stuff and meet real people

instead of robbing and exchange us goods and services for
monetary value but now i just steal steal monetary value

216
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:26,290

spent way too much time on this powerpoint selecting the

217
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:36,530
best transitions for everyone and putting transitions on
every single thing i feel like i'm back in school already i

218
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:45,170
like wait my mom works at fan of xbox i've done it without
you being a small little bitch you know first place thank

219
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:54,010
you i tried very hard and being a small little bitch all
right i honestly i already forgot what's okay oh yes yes

220
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:58,670
would you guys like to know the design process i had with my
mom so basically

221
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:09,990
my outfit inspiration i've always been a thief but in the
before four i realized my other outfit was very impractical

222
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:18,750
for thieving so I was inspired by a very classic Vocaloid
song Phantom Thieves Peter and Jenny it's a very very good

223
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:28,650
song you guys should check it out and this is the very first
draft that we had together it was between red or or gray I'm

224
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:38,210
sorry I can't I don't I don't know colors very well I am an
artist by the way so these are this is the very first draft

225
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:47,990
my outfit and then and then we got to here so as you see
we're trying to side hmm okay you can't see my legs right

226
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:54,970
now but we're trying to decide accessories here so I had two
versions at first to put your guys were like what are you

227
00:20:54,970 --> 00:21:03,430
put what are you doing with these tiny this tiny little this
tiny little bags here so this is where I put all my like uh

228
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:11,630
pick pocket pick pocket and lock the third one was like,
Clea, this bag is too tiny.

229
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:12,970
I can't fit anything in there.

230
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:14,810
Where did I put the snacks, too?

231
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,690
Where did I put anything in there?

232
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:19,150
Do I put pennies in this tiny bag?

233
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:23,670
So then Clea was like, yeah, this ain't it.

234
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:26,350
What am I going to do?

235
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:29,230
Put Cheetos in this tiny ass bag, Clea.

236
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:45,210
so so we were like so in the end we decided uh clayov uh
decided that this is a better option for my lock picking

237
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:52,450
stuff and my snackies too my snack breaks whenever i need to
get a snack break i go into this pocket and pull out a

238
00:21:52,450 --> 00:22:02,150
cheeto uh it also fits like other stuff too i guess to rob
you better but but what's important are my snackies only for

239
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:10,270
eating nothing but Cheetos now that's a nice leaky bag all
right and then we're like I would like more accessories

240
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:20,930
please so clay uh uh I would like some more accessories and
I just would like you to know uh my ear to my my ear right

241
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:28,430
here is a clip on because I'm afraid of piercings so
everything you see here are clip-ons, because I don't like

242
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:29,570
needles on my body.

243
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:33,670
It's a clip-on earring.

244
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:37,570
So we were trying to figure out, hmm, what's the best...

245
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:43,170
What are the best alternatives for accessories?

246
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:43,970
All of you.

247
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:50,090
Yeah, but the surgery, that's a clip-on too.

248
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:51,570
I can easily take my face off.

249
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:53,830
I can unclip my face off, guys.

250
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:54,350
It's alright.

251
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:55,610
They're all clip-ons.

252
00:22:55,790 --> 00:23:01,490
So, you can see all the little drafts we had here for the
different types of hair accessories that I had.

253
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:04,630
The face accessories I have here.

254
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:08,290
And yeah, we decided to mix and match them.

255
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:16,370
So, you can see that we mix and match some of the little,
the little, the little, the clover, heart, diamond, spade.

256
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:17,250
We mixed and matched them.

257
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:24,050
I was like, I don't think, I think I like, I think why don't
we try, why don't we try a different sort of mix and match?

258
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:28,910
Bing bada, bing bada boom.

259
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:29,890
Here we go.

260
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:31,250
There's my clip-on face.

261
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:32,230
There it is.

262
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:33,170
Next place is skin.

263
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:36,070
Damn.

264
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:37,630
Are your hair clips clip-ons too?

265
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:38,310
Yep, they are.

266
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:41,050
Everything you see on my face is a clip-on.

267
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:45,690
Because this is my, even my skin is a clip-on.

268
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:47,330
Because underneath is a tomato.

269
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:48,690
As we've learned earlier.

270
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:52,730
You guys got to pay attention or you won't get an A on the
test at the end.

271
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:09,300
all right anyways guys we're almost at the end of the
presentation why what already how could it be that fast but

272
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:18,200
guys we can hit the tart we can hit the target if we work
together that was just a mandatory thing i had to put in the

273
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:29,760
presentation to to appease the teachers all right the
bibliography so so guys are you guys are wondering who did

274
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:41,420
everything okay i just want you all to know i just want you
all to know um i spent an hour researching how to do an mla

275
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:54,040
format on twitter handles so uh i don't know if any of you
guys had ptsd on grade marking from teachers but if you mess

276
00:24:54,040 --> 00:25:05,000
up uh citations and format in bibliographies you get a mark
deduction for every wrong citation but I am a good student

277
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:19,360
Mrs. Johnson Mrs. Johnson I cited right I did the Emily
format so my overlays most of the overlays you see here is

278
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:26,740
done by bunnies uh she's amazing I go to her for a lot of
like uh overlays Like the animated cities over there in the

279
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:28,220
back, the eyes blinking.

280
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:29,280
She did all that.

281
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:30,640
She did all of that.

282
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:35,580
And in my starting screen, the starting screen you saw
there, the animation was done by Miflu.

283
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:37,860
She also did the transition stingers too.

284
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:39,520
So give her a warm.

285
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:42,180
My IV videos is coming back.

286
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:49,220
When a teacher drills you down with MLA format, you never
forget.

287
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,240
My logo.

288
00:25:54,260 --> 00:26:02,640
My doki bird logo was done by senior mu mu and he's actually
a Japanese logo designer too But he speaks English so it was

He did most of the songs.

303
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:16,320
And like each track he did was finished in a day.

304
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,340
Which is crazy.

305
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:18,600

myself because I realized, hey, I can't pay myself, so in

317
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:50,500
the end, I just pay other people to draw for it I pay other

355
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:59,680
to be fair it doesn't really matter how well you do in
school seeds get degrees all you have to do is pass jobs

356
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:12,080
don't care if you if you like barely if you got through
school by a nice solid 70% what is passing a nice solid uh

357
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:17,540
68% it's all right as long as you get the degree.

358
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:19,400
Thanks, Mrs. Johnson.

359
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:20,860

412
00:40:31,890 --> 00:40:39,270
The clapping one that I've painfully learned throughout my
years being a manufactured anime girl.

413
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:48,770
My mama fed me with many, many clapping algorithms, and I
finally learned the right way to clap.

414
00:40:49,130 --> 00:40:50,370
I finally learned it, guys.

415
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:52,090
I finally learned to clap, guys.

416
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:53,390

455
00:47:53,570 --> 00:48:11,590

last cup of coffee Someday we might be 80 And think about

456
00:48:11,590 --> 00:48:21,810
the different things we used to say All the memories of you
will just become A ghost of a smile Caught in the wind

457
00:48:21,810 --> 00:48:27,170
Someday It'll be the last day

458
00:48:40,290 --> 00:48:58,770
I won't forget how it feels to be loved To be remembered by
someone as special as you Someday I will of coffee with a

459
00:48:58,770 --> 00:49:15,610
smile so the reason why I chose this specific song let me
turn off the reverb real quick so the very first

460
00:49:15,610 --> 00:49:24,410
announcement that I wanted to show tell you guys I hope the
reverb's off yep the very first announcement that I wanted

461
00:49:24,410 --> 00:49:25,250
to show you guys

462
00:49:29,030 --> 00:49:43,500
I'll be graduating on May 14 but that means I have one month
with you guys left so that I have four weeks with you guys

463
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:52,280
all of you and that's why I chose the sign it must be a
surprise for all of you

464
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:05,720
and that was why I was very very very nervous it wasn't
because of the scuff PowerPoint is cuz I had to announce

465
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:15,400
this for you all so you guys are you guys all you might see
very very let me put the song back on like let's let's have

466
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:22,740
a jazzy tune to it let's have a jazzy tune to it this is not
a sad event guys I know it's I mean it could it is a sad

467
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:26,480
event but let's make it a happy one let's Let's make it a
happy one.

468
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:28,920
What do you mean you're graduating on May 14?

469
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:35,500
What I mean is that I would be stopping all VTuber
activities after my final stream on May 14.

470
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:43,140
So May 14 will be my final stream and I will be stopping all
content creations and all streaming activities then.

471
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:45,320
One, this is the last hiatus.

472
00:50:46,060 --> 00:50:46,940
Will I ever come back?

473
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:47,660
Who knows?

474
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:53,900
Mm.

475
00:50:55,180 --> 00:50:58,320
So, what does that mean about Twitch Partner and all of
that?

476
00:50:58,660 --> 00:51:02,200
Because we all know I try to apply Twitch Partner like three
separate times.

477
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:09,200
Well, I don't think it's fair for me to reapply for Twitch
Partner after this announcement.

478
00:51:09,620 --> 00:51:13,840
Only because I know the extra people are going to watch me
after that.

479
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:15,720
We'll be like, she's retiring!

480
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:17,360
She's retiring!

481
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:19,280
She's leaving!

482
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:20,820
We gotta watch it!

483
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:23,820
And I feel like those numbers might not be...

484
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:25,160
Ah, it won't be...

485
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:35,240
for me so I won't I will be refuting from applying for
twitch partner after that um so this is what I'm not here

486
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:40,720
for that I'm not here for twitch partnership I'm here for
you guys this is why I'm streaming an extra month for all of

487
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:54,280
you too because I want to spend the last the last four weeks
with all of you and end it with style so also this is why it

488
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:59,740
took me so long because I had to do a real PowerPoint after
the scuffed PowerPoint that took me way longer than I

489
00:51:59,740 --> 00:52:00,780
thought it would.

490
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:06,240
The scuffed ass PowerPoint that I did took me like two to
three days to do.

491
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:15,000
But this also took me two to three days to make.

492
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:20,720
So please, please appreciate the real PowerPoint too.

493
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:24,200
There's no cool ass transition.

494
00:52:24,620 --> 00:52:33,360
Just a little little alright so the next slide after this so
why are you leaving what happened so do you guys remember

495
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:48,560
how I say I'm allowed to rob banks and museums once a year
so I fucked up and I robbed a bank twice so I reach you guys

496
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:56,700
the letter that the bank sent me um dear dear dokeybird
promises very seriously.

497
00:52:57,300 --> 00:53:05,240
On April 16th, 2021, you and your rabbit minions have rabbed
establishment breaking the one heist per year agreement in

504
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:39,360

your address well they let me rob them so i figured this was

505
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:48,940
a fair deal i figured uh please update your windows and stop

the second time.

512
00:54:13,430 --> 00:54:14,390
Where do I go?

513
00:54:16,010 --> 00:54:22,790
Do you know my rabbit minions are accustomed to a very, very
expensive standard now?

514
00:54:23,170 --> 00:54:23,510
Do you want to?

515
00:54:27,070 --> 00:54:36,210

Miss Joki, quotation, maple, quotation, bird.

527
00:56:05,130 --> 00:56:07,030
Well, uh, just use Google Translate.

528
00:56:11,490 --> 00:56:13,050
Let's use Google Translate.

529
00:56:14,310 --> 00:56:17,130
But it's just, it's just, it's the same as Function as
Curious Cat.

530
00:56:17,450 --> 00:56:18,590
There's like a little box there.

531
00:56:18,650 --> 00:56:19,950
It'll be like, ask any question.

532
00:56:20,170 --> 00:56:23,650
And then you can write like, I don't know, like a seven page
essay or whatever.

533
00:56:24,110 --> 00:56:24,990
And then click submit.

534
00:56:25,290 --> 00:56:26,730
And then bam, bada bing bada boom.

535
00:56:27,070 --> 00:56:38,310
go um all right so what else is there well at the end of
this stream i'll be setting up several discord channels so b

536
00:56:38,310 --> 00:56:48,450
movie script i don't know if the algorithm is gonna allow
you to submit the b movie script but the last so the i after

537
00:56:48,450 --> 00:56:57,090
this stream i'll be opening several discord uh channels one
of them will be karaoke suggestions we're gonna have um i

538
00:56:57,090 --> 00:57:03,610
think like one or two karaoke nights in the four weeks and
i'll sing some of the songs that you guys suggest for me so

539
00:57:03,610 --> 00:57:09,370
some of them will be like songs i want to sing some don't be
the songs you guys want me to sing so uh it doesn't

540
00:57:09,370 --> 00:57:16,950
guarantee that i'll sing the songs but uh i'll select some
of them so it'll be like one or two uh days where i'll be

541
00:57:16,950 --> 00:57:24,510
doing karaoke nights for all of you and uh another thing
will be variety so there must be a lot of games you guys

542
00:57:24,510 --> 00:57:31,550
want me to stream before I go before I graduate and I'll be
also be opening a discord server for that as well so you can

543
00:57:31,550 --> 00:57:37,450
drop down any suggestions that you want me to play before I
go in those four weeks um doesn't get like I said doesn't

544
00:57:37,450 --> 00:57:44,650
guarantee that I'll pick them but we'll see we'll see
because we can't do chatting and apex streams all the time

545
00:57:44,650 --> 00:57:53,690
so I'll stream some of the games you guys want me to play
And then the postcards.

546
00:57:54,410 --> 00:57:56,690
April and May postcards will still be in effect.

547
00:57:56,850 --> 00:58:00,170
I actually got the April postcards today.

548
00:58:00,430 --> 00:58:02,530
I received it like an hour before I started stream.

549
00:58:02,710 --> 00:58:11,450
So for those of you who don't know what the postcards are,
every end of the month, the top five gifters, the top five

550
00:58:11,450 --> 00:58:15,250
gifters get a little postcard sent from me with little
goodies inside.

551
00:58:15,650 --> 00:58:17,810
And so I'll still be doing the last two months.

552
00:58:18,390 --> 00:58:25,150
But I will be stopping the last postcard on on May, on May
14th, which is my final stream.

553
00:58:25,390 --> 00:58:26,450

Thank you, thank you!

558
00:58:34,750 --> 00:58:37,490
So, yeah, I'll show you guys the April postcard design.

559
00:58:38,210 --> 00:58:41,590
I think it's after this slide, so I'll show you guys the
design for April.

560
00:58:41,770 --> 00:58:45,550
And I really love it too, because it's like a celebration
debut postcard.

561
00:58:47,670 --> 00:58:48,110
Subgames!

562
00:58:48,310 --> 00:58:50,690
I will be hosting subgames!

563
00:58:51,210 --> 00:58:58,870
um i don't know it'll be on stream but i do want to spend
the most i can with my community before i go so um i will

564
00:58:58,870 --> 00:59:08,150
also be opening a channel for that for you guys to suggest
some sub game ideas so i guess like apex uh jack box um what

565
00:59:08,150 --> 00:59:09,370
else can we play together

566
00:59:15,990 --> 00:59:23,670
uh i don't know but whatever you guys suggest i'll look into
it because i want to house like Maybe like two to three sub

567
00:59:23,670 --> 00:59:30,890
game nights before maybe one to two to three sub game nights
before I graduate And then movie night because I'll be

568
00:59:30,890 --> 00:59:36,650
leaving in four weeks We usually are gonna have two movie
nights For those of you don't know we have a movie night

569
00:59:36,650 --> 00:59:37,870
tomorrow at 10 p.m.

570
00:59:37,990 --> 00:59:47,490
PST on a Saturday We're gonna be watching Raya the last
dragon But because we have four weeks left together I'll be

571
00:59:47,490 --> 00:59:55,350
hosting a movie night every Saturday to be for the next the
other three weeks but i hope you guys will be excited

572
00:59:55,350 --> 01:00:02,130
because i love watching movies with all of you like on every
saturday saturday slash sunday it was it's always a great

573
01:00:02,130 --> 01:00:15,650
time because i say dumb stuff and you guys enable me shop ah
michael michael michael michael good timing so there's also

574
01:00:15,650 --> 01:00:25,170
another reason why i have to announce this early is because
I promised all of you that I will do merch, but it would be

575
01:00:25,170 --> 01:00:33,470
pretty awkward if I opened merch orders And then like four
weeks later, I'm like, okay, by the way, guys, I'm leaving

576
01:00:35,830 --> 01:00:42,230
And then you all be like, but I bought your merch, you can't
just leave So now I give you guys like, you know, you guys

577
01:00:42,230 --> 01:00:50,770
have some time to like decide if you want to buy merch or
not And that's another reason why I had to announce it

578
01:00:50,770 --> 01:00:57,790
earlier because I didn't want to I didn't want to like you
know like be like make you buy merch and then be like I'm

579
01:00:57,790 --> 01:01:10,190
leaving so this is alright I can like release the merch on
the same day as I announced as I announced my graduation day

580
01:01:10,190 --> 01:01:21,490
so and that's why we also have four weeks at the end of the
very end so after this after May 7th, all these, the items,

581
01:01:22,030 --> 01:01:27,670
the merch for, the items for merch, will never be released
again, so they are technically limited edition.

582
01:01:33,410 --> 01:01:39,710
And yeah, so for the merch, for the merch, I tried very hard
to price them reasonably because I didn't want to make

583
01:01:39,710 --> 01:01:40,910
profit off you guys.

584
01:01:41,070 --> 01:01:47,090
I tried to, like, but I still wanted to, like, make sure I
don't, like, lose too much money in general because like,

585
01:01:47,210 --> 01:01:55,370
shipping's, like, really, really expensive but it's a lot
cheaper than usual merch it's a lot cheaper because i i just

586
01:01:55,370 --> 01:02:02,870
calculated like production cost and like shipping and
because all the items we ship but from me like it's not from

587
01:02:02,870 --> 01:02:09,170
like a separate company that's doing it from for you for you
guys it's i'm shipping it myself and i'm contacting the

588
01:02:09,170 --> 01:02:14,150
manufacturers myself so it was very it was like a lot much
more work trying to calculate prices and everything because

589
01:02:14,150 --> 01:02:20,590
i have to do it all myself and but then but i want to do it
all myself because I want to include a little personal note

590
01:02:20,590 --> 01:02:28,990
to all the orders and and some little personal gifts from me
to you guys for those who would like to purchase the merch

591
01:02:28,990 --> 01:02:39,010
and stuff uh so I know I might lose money in the end because
I I feel like I did price it like like it might be like uh I

592
01:02:39,010 --> 01:02:45,090
might lose money in the end but that's okay that's okay it's
for you guys I did this for you guys and I promise the

593
01:02:45,090 --> 01:02:51,970
promise and I hope you guys The price isn't reasonable
because I spent like, I need you guys to know that I spent

594
01:02:51,970 --> 01:02:55,210
like 10 straight hours just figuring out prices in general.

595
01:02:55,250 --> 01:02:59,590
So please appreciate me.

596
01:03:01,010 --> 01:03:02,050
Appreciate my hard work.

597
01:03:04,070 --> 01:03:05,950
Yeah, shipping again is very weird too.

598
01:03:06,150 --> 01:03:09,750
Like it was very complicated trying to figure out the
shipping and everything.

599
01:03:10,110 --> 01:03:13,970
Especially when you don't have the items to like get the
quotes and everything.

600
01:03:17,170 --> 01:03:22,530
people around be like hey you shipped like dockies before
how much do they weigh

601
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:35,900
you know i've been stealing money for so long now i think
for the first time in my life i want to get back is this an

602
01:03:35,900 --> 01:03:50,860
epiphany and the final note for the slide is the fan tag um
it is the bark night as this should be, as it should be.

603
01:03:51,140 --> 01:03:57,360
So you can use this tag on Twitter, the hashtag of
BarkNights for like, I guess like fan, like anything you

604
01:03:57,360 --> 01:04:00,440
guys want to like send something, like fan art or whatever.

605
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:04,400
I'll be looking through the tags at least, I guess every
day.

606
01:04:05,580 --> 01:04:11,680
I'll be looking through the tags every day and retweeting
like anything retweetable.

607
01:04:15,820 --> 01:04:18,520
Can't believe you got to become weak on your old days aren't
you?

608
01:04:18,540 --> 01:04:21,120
Are the rabbits actually siphoning my fucking energy?

609
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:22,260
My life force?

610
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:22,940
Who knows?

611
01:04:25,940 --> 01:04:29,320
All right, so I don't remember what the next slide is, but
let's all see together.

612
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:30,940
Let's all be surprised together.

613
01:04:31,420 --> 01:04:31,440
Chat.

614
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:34,420
Ah, April's postcard.

615
01:04:34,980 --> 01:04:37,540
So this is April's postcard, everyone.

616
01:04:38,220 --> 01:04:48,520
So like I said earlier, every end of the month, I do a
postcard for the top five subgifters in the community.

617
01:04:48,540 --> 01:04:56,400
and this will be the postcard for April and I usually send
them I actually got this early so I have actually have the

618
01:04:56,400 --> 01:05:01,740
cards right now on me so I'll be shipping them at the end of
the month for the top five sub gifters and they usually

619
01:05:01,740 --> 01:05:10,340
include like little goodies and stuff and a personal, like a
little personal touch to it and everything so yeah and there

620
01:05:10,340 --> 01:05:18,640
will be a May postcard but that'll be a surprise until I get
the finished product it'll be a surprise even for me because

621
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:27,300
I don't know what it looks like too so so when I get it I'll
show it to you guys don't worry um I am pretty sure I have

622
01:05:27,300 --> 01:05:37,880
one more one more slide left ah the shop the shop so so you
guys are wondering what's in the shop well guys we have the

623
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:49,740
daki the doki makara the acrylic stand um stickers and
charms so I'll be opening the store opening the store at the

624
01:05:49,740 --> 01:05:57,260
end of the stream but it's just dokeyberry.bigcardle.com um
so let me give you guys a close-up of all of them for all of

625
01:05:57,260 --> 01:06:02,980
you so this is the acrylic stand and i don't remember what
that price twenty dollars so this is a six i was like what

626
01:06:02,980 --> 01:06:13,840
did i price i spent so much time calculating but i don't
even remember how much it cost so this is the acrylic stand

627
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:20,000
it's double sided and it's the and then i'm doing a butthart
i'm doing look at that i'm doing look at that now there's

628
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:31,140
three of us there's three of us it's um it's a double-sided
it's a double-sided acrylic stand and with a unique circular

629
01:06:31,140 --> 01:06:41,680
base of the background you guys always see a lot now there's
three of me which one's the real me i don't even know all

630
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:51,200
right the next the next are the charms are the charms this
is also oh yeah that of course we all know who did the

631
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:59,240
acrylic style my surgeon mama Clea it was very hard trying
to pick out the base but I realized you know what we all I

632
01:06:59,240 --> 01:07:04,080
feel like the rabbit would be much more memorable though
than the logo so I chose a rabbit in the end because we were

633
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:16,440
spent like hours trying to fucking decide one tells only
lies one only tells truth the 30s cheetahs all right so the

634
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:26,380
next item are the are the acrylic charms the acrylic is the
2.5 double-sided acrylic charm what did i price it as ah

635
01:07:26,380 --> 01:07:33,580
eight dollars i had to look i had to look because i don't
remember i had to i we all know i don't remember numbers

636
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:44,640
whenever i see numbers i go numbers of math Oh shit,
Whadding was Michael all along!

637
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:46,540
Oh my god!

638
01:07:47,020 --> 01:07:52,100
Alright, so yeah, it is a double-sided acrylic charm, and
it's gonna come with a star collapse.

639
01:07:52,460 --> 01:07:56,100
So it has a default expression and a smug expression.

640
01:07:56,440 --> 01:08:00,660
Also, the reason why this took so long to do is I had to do
all the graphics for these slides, too.

641
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:02,400
Like all the merch stuff and stuff.

642
01:08:02,580 --> 01:08:03,240
I just do it myself.

643
01:08:03,860 --> 01:08:04,340
So...

644
01:08:05,780 --> 01:08:06,260
Oh!

645
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:07,820
Okay, pretty cool.

646
01:08:09,320 --> 01:08:10,920
Ew, no, man.

647
01:08:15,100 --> 01:08:24,000
later his smug expression and a default expression for all
of you all right next up the next item are the stickers so

648
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:29,980
if you guys could see i didn't have uh my friend i didn't
have enough time to finish up the last two sketches but

649
01:08:29,980 --> 01:08:39,060
they'll be done by this week i'm i swear they'll be done by
this week i had so many things to do so it was like so so um

650
01:08:39,060 --> 01:08:46,660
these are three there'll be vinyl stickers um so technically
they're waterproof but i would suggest not testing like you

651
01:08:46,660 --> 01:08:53,840
know like pouring water on it every day to be like is it
really waterproof i was just not doing that but technically

652
01:08:53,840 --> 01:09:04,160
it is waterproof but not as waterproof as you think it is so
please don't pour water on it every day if it rains and then

653
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:09,060
you got like water on it it'll be fine but like if you like
decide to be like let me let me take these stickers out on a

654
01:09:09,060 --> 01:09:13,120
swim I am not responsible for that.

655
01:09:16,280 --> 01:09:23,480
So the four sticker designs are, and they're $3 a sticker,
and if you want all four of them, it'll be $10.

656
01:09:25,220 --> 01:09:28,340
So the, and they're like the outfits throughout the year.

657
01:09:28,660 --> 01:09:33,460
So all the stickers are, some of the outfits I've worn over
the years streaming.

658
01:09:34,040 --> 01:09:35,180

687
01:12:47,290 --> 01:12:54,530
dokeybird.bigcardall.com and I do provide worthwhile
shipping and that's what I'm like most scared about and

688
01:12:54,530 --> 01:13:00,270
thinking like I'm going to totally because I'm pricing this
because I don't really want to earn money like earn like

689
01:13:00,270 --> 01:13:06,450
profit from you guys um so I try to worldwide shipping.

690
01:13:06,590 --> 01:13:09,210
I try to price it as reasonable as I can.

691
01:13:09,330 --> 01:13:09,850
And they're my...

692
01:13:09,850 --> 01:13:11,010

708
01:15:08,050 --> 01:15:13,470

guys ever wondered why I kept calling it lore stream because

723
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:56,780
I think it would be weird because I was like I can't call it
a debut stream because I'm announcing my graduation I was

724
01:16:56,780 --> 01:17:02,620
like I can't call it a debut stream I can't call it a
re-debut stream it'll be weird I mean, because I'll be

725
01:17:02,620 --> 01:17:03,800
announcing my graduation.

726
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:07,260
And then that's why I was like, ha ha, lore stream.

01:17:09,220 --> 01:17:11,460
That's why I kept going, ha, lore stream.
