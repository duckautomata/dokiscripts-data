1
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:11,260
What's this?

2
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,240
We're in a city now?

3
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,160
Hello, hello,

4
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:28,260
Ruby, Roar, Renner, Exotic, Glacio, Ninja, Zeno, Oogoo.

5
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:34,870
Oh my god, there's so... Pauls and Ruby, thank you for the song!

6
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:38,860
For Pauls and Ruby, 46 months, Pauls.

7
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,960
Oh my god, and you're here for the special stream too!

8
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:46,500
Hello, Static, I'm bad, Acer, who else?

9
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:51,840
Espeny, Hem, Czar, seed of the tier 3 for 28 months!

10
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:53,780
Thank you everyone!

11
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:55,780
And gifting the song!

12
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:01,340
Gosh, everyone, can we get some more Borg Knights in chat for everyone?

13
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:04,360
Let's get some little claps in chat real quick.

14
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:08,640
Everyone, Acer the Prime, thank you guys so much!

15
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:11,940
Oh my god, we haven't even started the stream technically.

16
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,340
Ah, hello tier!

17
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:14,740
Thank you, thank you!

18
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:19,500
Also, the alerts have been muted because we will be uploading this mod on YouTube.

19
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:24,140
So, it'll be a bit weird if music kept playing every 10 seconds.

20
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:28,000
Thank you guys!

21
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,820
Are you guys excited for today's stream?

22
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,140
Look at this neat overlay here.

23
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,060
Do you guys know I live in the city?

24
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:37,220
Now you do.

25
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,680
I live in the city.

26
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:46,520
Hi Joe, thank you for the 100 videos.

27
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,060
Thank you, thank you everyone!

28
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:49,500
Are you okay?

29
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:51,260
It's only 6pm, right?

30
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,720
Okay, because I feel like this is a special stream today.

31
00:01:55,140 --> 00:02:01,220
So, for once in our lives, we're doing it for the non-degenerates out there.

32
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:05,760
The non-degenerates get to have some fun today.

33
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,940
Oh, I've never been so nervous before.

34
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:14,000
I usually go in being like, what am I gonna say today?

35
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:16,160
Even I don't know what I'm gonna say.

36
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,820
But today, today I have a plan.

37
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,480
I have a fucking plan.

38
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,360
Ina!

39
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:23,220
This stream was non-degenerates.

40
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,020
I just missed it.

41
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,620
Non-degenerate people.

42
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:28,980
Thank you everyone!

43
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:33,160
Thank you for the fucking 7 months of tier 1!

44
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,540
Thank you, thank you!

45
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,180
Can you give some more bark nights in chat?

46
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:38,620
Thank you guys!

47
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:39,760
What the fuck?

48
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,760
Non-degenerates, I'm out.

49
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,360
This is a union with the degenerates and the non-degenerates.

50
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,420
We are unifying the two sectors.

51
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,060
Today is the day.

52
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,620
Now you're wondering, what's that in the back?

53
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,420
What are those diamonds out there in the back?

54
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:01,100
Well, don't you guys know diamonds are a girl's second best friend.

55
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,420
Number one are the 3090s.

56
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,120
Number one are 3090s.

57
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:08,680
So...

58
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:13,060
That goes like... Oh, me, I'm just feeling...

59
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:13,620
Oh, Faye!

60
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,140
Thank you for the 3 months!

61
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,520
A 3-month stream!

62
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,540
More bark nights, more bark nights in chat.

63
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,240
More dark-mark nights, guys.

64
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,420
Thank you, everyone.

65
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,280
We haven't even started the actual part of the stream yet, guys.

66
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,340
Ah, you guys, you guys.

67
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,680
Thank you, thank you.

68
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:34,280
I really... I've been playing this for like 1 or 2 weeks now.

69
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,300
And getting a 3090.

70
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,320
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

71
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,380
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

72
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:56,980
I couldn't put the 3090s on my overlay you see here on the spotlight because oh yeah and also they're like there they put the spotlight out being like you can rob us I'm like okay sir I'll be heading to your house in like two or three hours after the streams done.

73
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:06,520
Remember if you want me to rob your house make sure you have a spotlight shining in the sky to call for me.

74
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,740
Alright guys...

75
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,800
I don't know what the fuck that cat's doing there though.

76
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,320
Like go back to your owner cat.

77
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,360
Oh gosh.

78
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:20,180
Alright guys.

00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:39,100

It's okay.

93
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,180

I have my USB stick flash drive ready to do my presentation everyone.

112
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:36,440
Don't worry I'm gonna head over to the staff computer right now.

113
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,440
And plug in my USB stick flash drive.

00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:43,900
Where I stored my presentation and my powerpoint presentation on Microsoft 2010.

119
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,210
No cards ready for you guys.

120
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:05,030
I plugged in my USB stick flash drive on the staff school computer.

121
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:07,250

134
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:42,670
alright.

135
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:46,770
Please I worked very hard I just want you guys to know I actually worked very hard on this powerpoint.

136
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:49,330
Alright.

137
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:50,810
Here it is.

138
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:53,370
Doki Bird.

139
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:56,290
By Doki Bird.

140
00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:00,190
On April 16th, 2021.

141
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:02,690
Twitch.tv slash Doki Bird.

142
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:11,870
We are here on a mission to provide a vision.

143
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:16,430
I couldn't find the English version of this, but it still means the same thing.

144
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:28,810
So... Alright, so... Guys, you guys must be all wondering... Who am I?

145
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:30,770
Who is this girl right here?

146
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:33,990
For those who don't know who I am, this is your first time on the stream.

147
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:41,870
So, my name is actually Doki, quotation, maple quotation, bird.

148
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:45,190
Ah yes, first name Doki, last name bird.

149
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:51,930
But no, no, to be fair, Doki bird is actually my thief name.

150
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:55,590
So you know how thieves don't put their real names in there?

151
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:58,010
Cause it's like, you know, that's how you get caught?

152
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:06,350
So, I'm called... My thief name is actually Doki bird, but my real name is maple, or is it?

153
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:08,410
I mean, I don't know, I have like 200 passports.

154
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:09,610
I think this is my real name.

155
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:14,810
After looking through like 200 of them, I think this is the closest one to my passport name.

156
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:19,010
It's been a while guys, it's... um...

157
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:23,110
It's been a while, so I don't really remember which one's the real one.

158
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:24,450
So I assume it's maple.

159
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:28,390
Anyway, as you guys were wondering...

160
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:28,770
What?

161
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,090
When's my birthday?

162
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:30,710
What?

163
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,970
You guys aren't born with 5 different birthdays?

164
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:34,790
So I have 5 birthdays.

165
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:36,050
Please write this down chat.

166
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:37,130
Please write this down.

167
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:41,750
Guys, please write this down.

168
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:44,430
My first birthday is on December 15th.

169
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:46,410
My second birthday is on December 15th.

170
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:50,610
My third birthday is on October 30th.

171
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:54,690
Guys, this will be on the test later, so please remember these birthdays.

172
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:57,650
My fourth one is April 16th, which is today.

173
00:08:57,730 --> 00:08:58,850
Happy birthday to me!

174
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:01,490
And then my last one is July 4th.

175
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:04,870
I still can't believe an entire country celebrates my birthday.

176
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:06,110
Isn't that crazy?

177
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:08,490
Who was born first, me or America?

178
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:10,170
Obviously me.

179
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:11,750
I'm immortal.

180
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:15,090
But then, that's not all guys.

181
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:17,050
There's more.

182
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:18,610
There's more.

183
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:23,530
What do I do?

184
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:28,910
Well, if you guys did not listen earlier, please wake up.

185
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:30,370
But what do I do?

186
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:31,510
I am a thief.

187
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:33,730
I am here to rob you.

188
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:38,070
So a hat will be passed down later at the end of the presentation.

189
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:40,490
And you can put how much money you want inside.

190
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:44,510
But I would recommend putting your entire wallet and a deed to your house.

191
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:46,170
So just remember that guys.

192
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:47,490
And a con man.

193
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:52,050
Ah, Komatsu!

194
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:53,490
Thank you for the raid!

195
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:55,430
You guys, you're just in time!

196
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:56,790
Just in time.

197
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:58,050
We are learning about me.

198
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:01,110
And a hat will be passed down, down the audience.

199
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:04,750
So remember to put down all your prized possessions in the hat.

200
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,750
Thank you very much everyone.

201
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:08,930
Do you think this entertainment is free?

202
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:12,750
No, there's a fucking $80 entrance fee guys.

203
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:14,150
But don't worry.

204
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:14,490
I don't want to be a nuisance.

205
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:16,170
I know some of you might have forgotten.

206
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:17,870
So just put $80 in the hat.

207
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:19,170
Plus your entire wallet.

208
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:20,610
Anyway...

209
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:25,890
I'm also a cat burglar.

210
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:26,630
Like I say.

211
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:28,750
I also break into your houses.

212
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:31,530
And it doesn't matter if you want me to.

213
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:34,470
I'm still... and you leave the door open.

214
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:35,690
And I'm locked.

215
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:37,250
I'm still gonna break in.

216
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:39,090
I'm breaking several of your windows.

217
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,050
Because that's where the fun part lies.

218
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:47,670
Hey Remy thank you so much for 3 months and I'm 1st tier.

219
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:49,010
Thank you guys.

220
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:51,650
Thank you everyone for the subs.

221
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:53,710
And the rate and some follows.

222
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:54,370
Thank you.

223
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:54,690
Thank you.

224
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:56,530
I really do appreciate it.

225
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:57,290
I really do.

226
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:58,590
I have my note cards here.

227
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,310
So I'm having a very good meditation.

228
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:03,050
I hope Mrs. Johnson gives me an A.

229
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:04,370
Anyway...

230
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:08,910
I actually do have one final thing to do.

231
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:09,750
One final job.

232
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,470
Is that I am also.

233
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:16,070
Also, if you guys did not realize, I am also an artist.

234
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:21,450
Because if you're wondering why do you take money for art?

235
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:24,330
Can't you just rob people instead?

236
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:30,210
Well the thing is, I'm giving like a little restriction on how many times I can rob someone.

237
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:35,470
And I have to abide by the terms of services from various banks and museums.

238
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:39,470
And we have an agreement that I can only rob them like once a year.

239
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:45,750
So because of that, I have to do an honest living and do streaming and art.

240
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:49,410
Because you know I spend too much money on things sometimes.

241
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:54,410
And I realize, oh shit I can't rob anyone anymore because I stole from everyone already.

242
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:57,150
I have to wait for 2022 to do that.

243
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:59,670
So now I have to draw.

244
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:00,830
Isn't that unlucky?

245
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,610
Doesn't that suck?

246
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:07,410
I have to do honest work for money?

247
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:08,710
God damn.

248
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:09,350
Hahaha.

249
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:09,450
Hahaha.

250
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:12,510
Sorry, don't care if you robbed us last week.

251
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:13,730
No more for the year.

252
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:15,430
That's basically it.

253
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:20,930
Every time I rob them, we sign a contract and be like, remember, can't rob us until next year.

254
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:22,030
I'm like, alright.

255
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:23,050
Hahaha.

256
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:28,010
Unfortunately, has to fall a lot most of the year.

257
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:28,830
Hahaha.

258
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,370
Imagine doing honest work.

259
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:33,970
Hahaha.

260
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:38,710
Pain.

261
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:39,670
Hahaha.

262
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:44,210
So it makes Jesus Night be getting robbed by me.

263
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:46,270
It's essentially like Christmas but not for her.

264
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:49,910
So poor fucker's gonna get robbed this time of the year.

265
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:52,090
Why did anyone get hit again by January 1?

266
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:54,030
Sorry for no swiping.

267
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:55,430
Unlucky.

268
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:59,990
Alright, so some of you guys might be wondering, who are these little rabbits?

269
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:02,330
Who are my rabbit sidekicks?

270
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:03,130
My rabbit minions?

271
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:06,070
My little, my little Rabbnions.

272
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:08,870
Well, the white one is called Bow-Bow.

273
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:11,150
And he's controlled by the white.

274
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:11,790
The right...

275
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:16,070
The white bows I have on my left head.

276
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:18,850
And then the black one is called Maymay.

277
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:20,450
So where did he come from?

278
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:21,550
Where did he come from?

279
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:22,250
Where did he go?

280
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:24,050
Where are you going, Cotton Eye Joe?

281
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:28,590
So, these two rabbits, as you guys can see, I stole them.

282
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:29,110
Hahaha.

283
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:33,590
I stole them from a lab.

284
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:36,690
I broke into a lab and was like, there's nothing here.

285
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:39,570
But then I saw these two cute little rabbits.

286
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:41,130
Bow-Bow and Maymay.

287
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:42,290
I called them Bow-Bow and Maymay.

288
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:43,270
They don't, they don't...

289
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:45,970
I don't know if they had names before, but it doesn't matter.

290
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:46,670
I renamed them.

291
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:50,070
So they're now known as Bow-Bow and Maymay.

292
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:51,910
We don't talk about their past names.

293
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:53,250
Hahaha.

294
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:56,490
If you rename something, it's yours forever.

295
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:58,330
So that's the rules.

296
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:01,850
Um, how many pushers do they have?

297
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:02,850
Hahaha.

298
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:06,170
I don't know if they're robots.

299
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:08,210
You know, I've never like looked inside them.

300
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:10,870
I don't know if they're robots or aliens.

301
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:13,910
Or animatronics.

302
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:16,530
Or like possessed dolls.

303
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:17,450
I don't know.

304
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:21,970
I've never like, you know, I don't know, ripped apart and see what's inside of them.

305
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:27,110
But I feel like, I feel like they have their own souls and personalities.

306
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:28,230
Who knows?

307
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:29,170
Who knows?

308
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:30,430
I don't know much.

309
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:31,970
I just let them do whatever they want.

310
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:33,790
Um, they sometimes they tag along.

311
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:34,450
Do they speak?

312
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:35,650
They don't know how to speak.

313
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:38,490
Sometimes they tag along with me for heists and stuff.

314
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:39,350
And on...

315
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:40,970
What did I just ask them?

316
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:42,010
Hahaha.

317
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:45,050
Those are the rules of the streets.

318
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:48,990
So, they tag along with me on various heists.

319
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:51,390
They love to cause destruction and mischiefs.

320
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:53,090
Um, maybe more than me.

321
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:53,950
I don't know.

322
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:58,290
Sometimes I come home and I see them with their own like bags of money.

323
00:14:58,530 --> 00:14:59,850
And some of their own pets.

324
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:01,970
So, I don't know what they're doing.

325
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:02,790
Hahaha.

326
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,910
Sometimes they're on their own little adventures.

327
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:08,270
And I just let them do whatever they want.

328
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:09,790
Sometimes they tag along with me.

329
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:11,530
And help me break into various places.

330
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:13,150
And that's great.

331
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:14,750
I have a good time with them.

332
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:15,990
So, maomao...

333
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:17,070
Maomao...

334
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:18,470
Mei Mei and Bao Bao!

335
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:21,250
Nice to meet you guys.

336
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:21,890
Hahaha.

337
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:25,190
Alright.

338
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:25,890
Alright.

339
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:26,810
What's next?

340
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:28,290
What's next?

341
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,110
I don't even know...

342
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:31,430
Oh!

343
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:33,190
Okay, you guys don't know what I do.

344
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:34,690
I play PPU games.

345
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:36,750
So, we don't talk about the...

346
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,590
That screenshot on the far back.

347
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:41,030
We don't talk about that game anymore.

348
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:42,790
That's dead to me.

349
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:44,810
But I used to be a very good player.

350
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:46,310
And now I'm not.

351
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:47,370
Now I'm not.

352
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:48,110
Hahaha.

353
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:52,510
Now I play mostly Apex.

354
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:55,270
And I used to be a very good player there too.

355
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:56,390
But now I'm not.

356
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:58,130
So, now I'm just media average.

357
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:01,870
But, you know, sometimes I wanna flex a little.

358
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:04,150
I wanna flex my past self.

359
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:06,990
What I used to be able to do.

360
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:08,570
Now I can't do it anymore.

361
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:09,430
But that's okay.

362
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:12,010
I still have my memories.

363
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:14,270
And that's all that matters now.

364
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:15,590
I have my memories.

365
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:20,310
We did not speak of the old game.

366
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:21,850
We do not speak of it.

367
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:24,170
Anyway, I also do art.

368
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,010
When I have to do an honest living.

369
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:27,810
And I can't rob anyone anymore.

370
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:29,530
So, if you guys can see on the right.

371
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:32,630
I do a lot of emotes for a lot of streamers.

372
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,490
And those are some of my favorite ones.

373
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:36,590
Over the last year.

374
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:37,470
On 2020.

375
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:39,590
And then you see on the left.

376
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:41,410
Some of the merch that I've made.

377
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:44,230
Some of the merch I've made.

378
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:46,730
Because before Covid.

379
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:51,030
I used to go to conventions.

380
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:51,990
And sell stuff.

381
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:53,730
And meet real people.

382
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:59,410
And exchange goods and services for monetary value.

383
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:02,910
But now I just steal monetary value items.

384
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:04,470
Because I realize that's easier.

385
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:10,150
Look at all these transitions.

386
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:11,290
Oh, what's this?

387
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:13,490
Tomato.

388
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:19,060
I have a hat now.

389
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:20,200
I found my hat.

390
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:28,180
So, underneath everyone's skin suit.

391
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,260
Is a tomato.

392
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:30,800
And I found my hat.

393
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,480
I found my hat, guys.

394
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:34,500
Isn't that...

395
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:38,760
Sometimes when I take off my skin suit.

396
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:40,080
I don't know where my hat is.

397
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,160
I found it.

398
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:41,740
So...

399
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,240
So, does that mean I can...

400
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,900
Jack you with a pitchfork?

401
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:52,010
Alright.

402
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:52,990
Alright.

403
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:54,210
What's this?

404
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:55,730
What's this over here?

405
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,310
Oh, my surgeon mama.

406
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:00,070
So, you guys do not know.

407
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:03,390
My very talented, very talented, very skilled.

408
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:05,170
Plastic surgeon mama.

409
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:06,870
Is Kleia.

410
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:09,310
Kleia is my surgeon mama.

411
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:11,750
I paid her lots of money to make me beautiful.

412
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:16,410
I went under the knife.

413
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:17,650
And now here I am.

414
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:19,250
That's me.

415
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:20,470
Oh, what's this?

416
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:22,030
Hey, guys.

417
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:22,790
You do not know Kleia.

418
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:23,790
She is amazing.

419
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:25,810
She is amazing.

420
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:27,210
Look at her art.

421
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:28,990
Look at her art.

422
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:29,990
Look at it.

423
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:33,770
Look at the beautiful art.

424
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:34,670
Look at all this.

425
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:35,850
Look at that.

426
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:37,330
And my favorite.

427
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:38,870
I bet you.

428
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:41,530
Your mom isn't as buff as my mom.

429
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:45,810
I challenge your moms.

430
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:48,210
I challenge your mom.

431
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:50,230
To a backyard fight.

432
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:53,650
Yeah.

433
00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:01,330
Not everyone can say that their moms are buff as fuck.

434
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,810
She lifts every day.

435
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:03,670
Look at her.

436
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:07,750
My mom is cooler than your mom.

437
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:09,330
My mom is cooler than your mom.

438
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:11,010
My mom could beat your mom up.

439
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:12,490
But yeah, I love her.

440
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:13,150
I love Kleia.

441
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:15,650
She made me the smug little bitch I am today.

442
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:21,470
I hope you guys are liking all these transitions.

443
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:22,090
I spent.

444
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:25,150
I legitimately spent way too much time on this powerpoint.

445
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:25,710
I legitimately spent way too much time on this powerpoint.

446
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:27,590
Selecting the best transitions for everyone.

447
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:29,770
And putting transitions on every single thing.

448
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:34,190
I feel like I'm back in school already.

449
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:34,630
I feel like I'm back in school already.

450
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:37,950
I like when my mom works at Microsoft.

451
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:40,130
I can get you banned off Xbox.

452
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:42,850
I've done it without you.

453
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,190
Being a smug little bitch.

454
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:44,790
You're the first place.

455
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:45,210
Thank you.

456
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:48,010
I tried very hard at being the smug little bitch.

457
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:50,750
All right.

458
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:52,490
I honestly already forgot what's...

459
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:52,750
Okay.

460
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:53,370
Oh yes.

461
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:56,890
Would you guys like to know the design process I had with my mom?

462
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:58,830
So basically...

463
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:03,330
My outfit inspiration.

464
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:04,450
I've always been a thief.

465
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:06,510
But in the before four.

466
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:09,790
I realized my other outfit was very impractical.

467
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:11,090
For thieving.

468
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:13,470
So I was inspired by...

469
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:15,730
A very classic Vocaloid song.

470
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:16,870
Phantom Thieves.

471
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:17,670
Peter and Jenny.

472
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:18,870
It's a very very good song.

473
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:19,790
You guys should check it out.

474
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:22,910
And this was the very first draft that we had together.

475
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:25,710
It was between red or...

476
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:26,830
Gray?

477
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:28,750
I'm sorry.

478
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:30,670
I don't know colors very well.

479
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:32,310
I am an artist by the way.

480
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:39,470
So this was the very first draft of my outfit.

481
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:43,810
And then we got to here.

482
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:45,030
So as you see.

483
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:45,950
We were trying to decide.

484
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:46,750
Okay.

485
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:48,090
You can't see my legs right now.

486
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,510
But we were trying to decide accessories here.

487
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:52,910
So I had two versions at first.

488
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:54,430
You guys were like.

489
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:56,780
What are you doing with these tiny little...

490
00:20:57,730 --> 00:20:59,630
These tiny little bags here.

491
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:01,870
So this is where I put all my...

492
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:02,470
Like...

493
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:03,970
Pickpocket.

494
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:06,970
Pickpocket and lock picking devices.

495
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:08,230
In those little bags.

496
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:09,930
But then I realized the third one was like.

497
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:11,430
Clea this bag is too tiny.

498
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:12,770
I can't fit anything in there.

499
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:14,470
Where do I put the snacks too?

500
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:16,470
Where do I put anything in there?

501
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:18,910
Do I put pennies in this tiny bag?

502
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:20,870
So then Clea was like.

503
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:23,290
Yeah this ain't it.

504
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:26,250
What am I going to do?

505
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:29,050
Put Cheetos in this tiny ass bag Clea?

506
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:29,850
Clea?

507
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:34,490
So...

508
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:35,870
So we were like.

509
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:38,190
So in the end.

510
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:39,150
We decided.

511
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:40,330
Clea.

512
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:43,590
Decided that this is a better option.

513
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:45,370
For my lock picking stuff.

514
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:47,330
And my snackies too.

515
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:48,090
My snack breaks.

516
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:50,010
Whenever I need to get a snack break.

517
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:52,590
I go into this pocket and pull out a Cheeto.

518
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:55,310
It also fits other stuff too.

519
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:56,390
I guess to rob you better.

520
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,690
But what's important are my snackies.

521
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:03,410
Only for getting nothing but Cheetos.

522
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:05,330
Now that's a nice leaky bag.

523
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:06,410
Alright.

524
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:07,590
And then we were like.

525
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:10,530
I would like more accessories please.

526
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:11,690
So Clea.

527
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:15,410
I would like some more accessories.

528
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:17,850
And I just would like you to know.

529
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:19,530
My earring.

530
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:21,130
My ear right here.

531
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:22,410
Is a clip on.

532
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:24,810
Cause I'm afraid of piercings.

533
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:27,110
So everything you see here are clip ons.

534
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:29,390
Cause I don't like needles on my body.

535
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:29,830
I'm afraid of piercings.

536
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:32,350
So I'm afraid of piercings.

537
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:33,430
It's a clip on earring.

538
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:35,850
So we were trying to figure out.

539
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:37,250
What's the best.

540
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:40,230
What are the best alternatives.

541
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:42,890
For accessories.

542
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:44,150
For accessories.

543
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:48,690
But the surgery.

544
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:49,970
That's a clip on too.

545
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:51,430
I can easily take my face off.

546
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:53,650
I can unclip my face off guys.

547
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:54,090
It's alright.

548
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:55,410
They're all clip ons.

549
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,970
So you can see all the little drafts.

550
00:22:57,990 --> 00:22:58,510
We had here.

551
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:00,770
For the different types of hair accessories.

552
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:03,970
The face accessories I have here.

553
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:06,390
And yeah.

554
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:08,070
We decided to mix and match them.

555
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:11,730
So you can see that we mix and match some of the.

556
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:12,190
The little.

557
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:14,890
The clover heart.

558
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:16,290
Diamond spade.

559
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:17,210
We mixed and matched them.

560
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:17,470
I was like.

561
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:18,410
I don't think.

562
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:19,170
I think.

563
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:23,850
Why don't we try a different sort of mix and match.

564
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:24,850
And then.

565
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:25,570
Bam.

566
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:28,610
Bing bada bing bada boom.

567
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:29,790
Here we go.

568
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:30,970
There's my clip on face.

569
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:32,130
There it is.

570
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:32,790
That's my skin.

571
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:37,510
Are your hair clips clip ons too?

572
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:38,170
Yep they are.

573
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:40,790
Everything you see on my face is a clip on.

574
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:41,590
Because.

575
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:45,550
This is my skin is a clip on.

576
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:46,990
Because underneath is a tomato.

577
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:48,590
As we've learned earlier.

578
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:52,610
You guys gotta pay attention or you won't get an A on the test at the end.

579
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:54,510
You won't get an A on the test at the end.

580
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,320
Alright.

581
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:00,500
Anyways guys.

582
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,000
We're almost at the end of the presentation.

583
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:04,540
Already?

584
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:06,900
How could it be?

585
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,360
That fast?

586
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,480
But guys.

587
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,420
We can hit the target.

588
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,560
If we work together.

589
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,600
That was just a mandatory thing.

590
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,500
I had to put in the presentation.

591
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:21,180
To appease the teachers.

592
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,120
Alright.

593
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:25,380
The bibliography.

594
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:26,440
So.

595
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:27,680
So guys.

596
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,020
Are you guys wondering who did everything?

597
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:30,960
Okay.

598
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:32,260
I just want you all to know.

599
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,820
I just want you all to know.

600
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:37,520
I spent an hour.

601
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,120
Researching.

602
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:41,740
How to do an MLA format.

603
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,700
On Twitter handles.

604
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:44,640
So.

605
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,700
I don't know if any of you guys had PTSD.

606
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,160
On great.

607
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:49,760
Marking.

608
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,760
From teachers.

609
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:54,340
But if you mess up.

610
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,280
Citations.

611
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,860
An MLA format.

612
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,440
In bibliographies.

613
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,980
You get a mark deduction.

614
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:02,860
For every wrong citation.

615
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:04,900
But I am a good student.

616
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:05,660
Mrs. Johnson.

617
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:07,200
Mrs. Johnson.

618
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:08,200
I cited right.

619
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:12,560
I did the MLA format.

620
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,160
So.

621
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,360
My overlays.

622
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,940
Most of the overlays you see here.

623
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:19,800
Is done by.

624
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:20,540
Bunnies.

625
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:21,820
She is amazing.

626
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,200
I go to her for a lot of overlays.

627
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,280
Like the animated cities.

628
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:26,880
Over in the back.

629
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:27,980
The eyes blinking.

630
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,100
She did all of that.

631
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:31,860
And in my starting screen.

632
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,740
The animation was done by.

633
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:35,460
Miflu.

634
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:37,540
She also did the transition stingers too.

635
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:39,320
So give her a warm.

636
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,840
My IBD is coming back.

637
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,780
When a teacher.

638
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:47,220
Drills you down with MLA format.

639
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:48,940
You never forget.

640
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,040
My logo.

641
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,520
My Yogi bird logo.

642
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:57,520
Was done by Senior Mew Mew.

643
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:00,740
And he is actually a Japanese logo designer too.

644
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:01,980
But he speaks English.

645
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:02,860
So it was great.

646
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:06,360
At first I just google translated.

647
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,900
I google translated.

648
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,960
English to Japanese.

649
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:09,900
And I was like.

650
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,800
Can you do me a logo.

651
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:14,220
And he wrote back in English.

652
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,360
Because I guess he realized.

653
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:19,040
My google translated Japanese.

654
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:20,620
Was very bad.

655
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,340
So he was like.

656
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,780
We can talk in English.

657
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:25,820
And I was like thank you.

658
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,280
Thank you so much.

659
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:29,620
I.

660
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:33,480
Who would have thought.

661
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:36,200
I didn't even tell him I know English.

662
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:37,040
I just like.

663
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:38,160
Send him what I want.

664
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,720
I was like are you open for logo commissions.

665
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:43,000
And then in Japanese.

666
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:44,420
Because I just you know.

667
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,220
I wrote that in English.

668
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,060
And then google translated.

669
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,360
And then copy and pasted it to him.

670
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,180
And he wrote back in English to me.

671
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,680
He wrote back in English.

672
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,940
And was like yes I do logo commissions.

673
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,280
And I was like thank you.

674
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,800
And we can speak in English.

675
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:58,600
I was like thank you.

676
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:03,120
And the music.

677
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,000
The jazzy music we had here.

678
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:06,200
Was done by Nal Noor.

679
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,100
It was crazy.

680
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:08,540
He did most of the songs.

681
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:09,280
Um.

682
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,180
He did most of the songs.

683
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,700
And like each track he did.

684
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:16,140
Was finished in a day.

685
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:17,020
Which is crazy.

686
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,320
He's like so talented.

687
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:19,760
And I was like.

688
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,300
You know what I asked for him.

689
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,580
I was like I want some background music.

690
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,380
For my character.

691
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:26,320
And I want it to be jazz.

692
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,540
And then bam.

693
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,380
Three hours later.

694
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,660
Here's the first draft.

695
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:32,540
I'm like what the fuck.

696
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:34,780
Okay.

697
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:38,960
It's time time for what.

698
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:39,540
It's Laura time.

699
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,340
We're learning so much about me.

700
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,740
And then my other screens.

701
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:48,500
Sorry I'm so dumb.

702
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:50,320
I'm just saying her name too.

703
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,120
Hoopiyon.

704
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:56,260
So Hoopiyon.

705
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:58,440
She has done a lot of my Be right back screens.

706
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:00,860
Which I will show you guys later on.

707
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:01,940
When I have to be right back.

708
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:06,120
And get ready for showing you guys the expressions.

709
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:07,980
And the animations that I have.

710
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:10,260
That Clea my mom did for me.

711
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:10,860
Um.

712
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:13,940
She did a ton of Be right back screens for me.

713
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:14,600
A lot of them.

714
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:15,860
Like the sky one.

715
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:17,260
The desert one.

716
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,320
I didn't recognize them.

717
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:21,340
But all of them were done by her.

718
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:22,740
And my emotes.

719
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,660
The non-bark knight emotes that you see.

720
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:25,880
By the way.

721
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:26,960
If you guys do not recall.

722
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,360
I am an emote artist.

723
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:33,580
But I am not motivated by anything but money.

724
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,280
So I don't draw for myself.

725
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,540
Because I realized.

726
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:39,000
Hey I can't pay myself.

727
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:42,300
So in the end I just pay other people to draw for me.

728
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:47,320
I pay other people to do the work for me.

729
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:48,380
Because I realized.

730
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:49,240
Hey.

731
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:52,140
I don't want to do anything for myself.

732
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:56,500
Oh my god CB.

733
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:57,920
Thank you for the gift that's up.

734
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,000
Thank you CB.

735
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:01,460
Can we get some more bark knights in chat for CB.

736
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:03,100
And Linking.

737
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:04,940
Linking for the prime.

738
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:05,660
Thank you.

739
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:09,240
More bark knights in chat everyone.

740
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,540
Let me get some claps in here.

741
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,540
We all know the clap.

742
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:15,060
My algorithm has learned how to clap properly now.

743
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,420
So I am going to do this as much as I can.

744
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:21,580
I am going to clap.

745
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,320
I am going to clap.

746
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,240
So Hachi did my emotes.

747
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,460
The non bark knight ones.

748
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,360
And the other emotes that you see there.

749
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,360
I did it.

750
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,040
I just pulled out MS Paint.

751
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,240
I drew a sword.

752
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:35,020
Or I took a picture of my dog.

753
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:36,240
I drew eyes on him.

754
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:39,200
I didn't even upload the original file.

755
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,160
I did it on stream.

756
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,640
And I asked my chat.

757
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:45,340
Can you guys screenshot my stream for me.

758
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:48,340
And then send it over.

759
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,580
And then I will upload it on Twitch.

760
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,760
You can see in the sub badges too.

761
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:55,480
I drew that.

762
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,080
I drew the sub badges.

763
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:01,340
Some of you guys might see the little cross hair.

764
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:03,560
Of my mouse on the sub badges.

765
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,940
Because those are just screenshots of the screen.

766
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:13,330
I am a very productive member of society.

767
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:16,710
But that's not all.

768
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:18,550
There is more.

769
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:21,950
So...

770
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:24,770
If you go to the end.

771
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:26,530
We have an outro video.

772
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:28,470
And it's the usual outro video.

773
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:29,330
I didn't change it.

774
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:30,590
It's not revamped or anything.

775
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:32,830
But that was done by Evil Desu.

776
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:35,410
And he is actually amazing.

777
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:36,950
He has done a lot of...

778
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:39,210
animated videos with motion graphics.

779
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:41,030
And stuff for people like Pokemon.

780
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:42,030
And everything.

781
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:46,250
And I saw the stuff he's done and I'm like...

782
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:48,430
here is money that I stole.

783
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:49,350
Can you do a little...

784
00:30:49,370 --> 00:30:50,210
This is the one for me too.

785
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:52,790
And then, yep, he did the outro video.

786
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:54,630
And the other graphics, Hibi.

787
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:57,550
Hibi, I've gone to her many numerous times.

788
00:30:57,610 --> 00:31:01,370
Like YouTube thumbnails, the video thumbnails that I want.

789
00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:05,310
Some YouTube thumbnails.

790
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:10,490
Like any graphics I need, like emergency or just like something super quick done, I go to Hibi for it.

791
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:12,190
And she also does the postcards for them.

792
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:19,310
If you guys, for those of you who know about the postcards design, she did most, she did, not most, all the graphics for the postcards.

793
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:20,450
You stole?

794
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:21,530
Of course, I'm a thief!

795
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:24,150
I'm just an honest thief trying to make a living.

796
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:25,270
Of course I stole.

797
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:33,260
And then the alerts, if you guys, the alerts.

798
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,040
These guys have commissioned over the years.

799
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:40,480
So Insanity, Poor, and Cassies have done most of the alerts that you see here.

800
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:44,740
In terms of like follow, subscriptions, and um...

801
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,260
What else?

802
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:47,300
What else do people do?

803
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:54,780
Raids, hosts, like most of them all those bits, most of all those alert animations you see there, the artwork for that were done by those three.

804
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:56,880
So yeah, it's great.

805
00:31:57,260 --> 00:32:01,960
Alright, so, that is actually the end of my PowerPoint.

806
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:04,320
Do I get an A, Mrs. Johnson?

807
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,680
I did the thing.

808
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,080
Uh-huh.

809
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:12,460
Uh-huh.

810
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:15,620
Yeah.

811
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:17,180
Oh!

812
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,300
Alright, Mrs. Johnson said I got a C.

813
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:19,840
But that's...

814
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,900
I tried to make that...

815
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,540
It's okay.

816
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,100
You failed successfully.

817
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:38,600
Hey guys, I passed!

818
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:40,240
I passed!

819
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:41,560
Everyone!

820
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,020
I passed, guys!

821
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:45,620
I got a C!

822
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,040
Woo!

823
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:53,100
To be fair, it doesn't really matter how well you do in school.

824
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,160
C's get degrees!

825
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,720
All you have to do is pass!

826
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:00,220
Jobs don't care!

827
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:08,340
If you like, if you got through school by a nice solid 70% What is passing?

828
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:14,980
A nice solid 68% It's alright!

829
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:17,140
As long as you get the degree!

830
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:19,140
Thanks, Mrs. Johnson!

831
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:20,580
Thank you!

832
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:21,700
Alright, guys!

833
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,600
Alright, so what's next?

834
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:24,640
You guys are wondering.

835
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:25,220
What's next?

836
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:26,460
Cause that was a very short...

837
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:28,700
That was a very short powerpoint.

838
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:30,620
What are my likes and dislikes?

839
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:32,740
What are my favorite games?

840
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:34,880
What are the music I like?

841
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:36,700
We don't need to care about that right now.

842
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:40,580
What we need to care about is look at all the things I can do with my body.

843
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:43,420
Now, I'll be right back real quick while I set that up.

844
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:23,940
Wow!

845
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:25,620
Hello everyone!

846
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:27,040
Alright, guys!

847
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,060
This is it!

848
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,660
This is what you've been waiting for!

849
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:32,060
What can... the full thing!

850
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:32,820
Alright, guys.

851
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:40,740
So I have several several amazing expressions that my surgeon mama has given me on my clip-on face.

852
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,220
So let me show you guys.

853
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:45,100
I'm pretty sure some of you guys might have seen them already.

854
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:46,760
Because, um...

855
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:50,960
I sort of showed them throughout my time streaming with this.

856
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:53,040
So streaming with my clip-on body.

857
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:55,280
So let me show you the first one.

858
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,560
The first one is the smug.

859
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,360
.

860
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:58,620
.

861
00:35:58,620 --> 00:35:58,780
.

862
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:06,540
It is a permanent smug face.

863
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:07,540
.

864
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:10,700
.

865
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:12,500
Now, the second one.

866
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:16,880
The second expression I'll be showing you guys is the cry expression.

867
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:18,100
.

868
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:20,960
.

869
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:21,500
.

870
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:32,940
.

871
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:34,860
.

872
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:34,900
.

873
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:35,360
.

874
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:35,440
.

875
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:35,460
.

876
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:35,480
.

877
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:35,500
.

878
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:35,520
.

879
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:35,540
.

880
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:39,060
.

881
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:39,160
.

882
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:39,440
.

883
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:56,630
.

884
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:56,650
.

885
00:36:56,650 --> 00:36:56,670
.

886
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:56,690
.

887
00:36:56,690 --> 00:36:56,710
.

888
00:36:56,890 --> 00:36:56,970
.

889
00:36:56,970 --> 00:36:57,010
.

890
00:36:57,010 --> 00:36:57,030
.

891
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:57,050
.

892
00:36:57,050 --> 00:36:57,110
.

893
00:36:57,110 --> 00:36:57,150
.

894
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:57,230
.

895
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:57,390
.

896
00:36:58,430 --> 00:36:59,170
.

897
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:07,970
.

898
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:08,890
.

899
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:09,470
.

900
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:09,570
.

901
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:10,150
.

902
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:10,190
.

903
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:10,230
.

904
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:10,270
.

905
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:11,490
Math?

906
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:16,310
Math in my living room?

907
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:27,010
So, that's my fuck math expression.

908
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:31,730
The next one, this one is my favorite too.

909
00:37:31,970 --> 00:37:33,550
I really... math is really...

910
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:41,830
This is one of my... this is another one of my favorite ones that my surgeon mama has given me.

911
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:46,530
I love food.

912
00:37:47,210 --> 00:37:49,750
I love my little Cheetos in my Cheeto pocket.

913
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:51,990
Oh, and also money.

914
00:37:57,060 --> 00:38:00,440
My $80 entrance fee to the stream.

915
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:01,940
Money.

916
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:10,020
Thank you everyone for paying the $80 entrance fee guys.

917
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:12,020
Thank you.

918
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:18,080
I'm sure the museum she's gonna rob.

919
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:23,040
I see Ruby is gonna redeem one of my other favorites.

920
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,020
Do we have to pay every time?

921
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:28,840
Every 10 seconds you gotta pay $80 to keep watching.

922
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:29,900
It's like...

923
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:35,600
You know like those pay to watch videos?

924
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:41,520
Every 10 seconds you gotta pay $80 to redeem the next 10 seconds guys.

925
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,020
Also another...

926
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:44,260
I don't know what my wallet is.

927
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,080
Ah, this one's a favorite.

928
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:46,620
So...

929
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:49,140
This is called the... this is an animation.

930
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:50,540
Called a blink animation.

931
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,340
I'll show you guys.

932
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:54,600
Ah!

933
00:38:57,370 --> 00:38:57,810
Ah!

934
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:02,510
When I'm too dumb, Chalix to do that.

935
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:04,270
I guess to make me more dumb.

936
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:06,230
I don't... I don't... that sounds very...

937
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:08,210
That seems very counterproductive.

938
00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:09,430
But apparently...

939
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:13,870
But I guess Chalix do what Chalix to do.

940
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:14,850
While my wallet is...

941
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:15,650
Well, you're not...

942
00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:16,390
You're not...

943
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:17,850
I mean...

944
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:19,770
You missed the presentation where I got the C.

945
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:20,910
But that's okay.

946
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:24,730
Alright, this last expression.

947
00:39:25,090 --> 00:39:28,050
This very last expression that we have.

948
00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:30,170
Is...

949
00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:31,330
Hm...

950
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:32,410
It's...

951
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:33,150
It's...

952
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:35,590
It's not like I wanna rob you or anything.

953
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:36,770
Baka.

954
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:44,710
You think I really wanted to rob you?

955
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:46,250
Not really.

956
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:47,090
Baka.

957
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:53,090
The worst.

958
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:54,070
Baka.

959
00:39:54,890 --> 00:39:55,330
Alright.

960
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:56,110
So...

961
00:39:57,010 --> 00:39:57,890
We have...

962
00:39:58,610 --> 00:39:59,050
Two...

963
00:39:59,050 --> 00:39:59,450
Three...

964
00:39:59,450 --> 00:40:00,410
Three more to go.

965
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:01,390
Three more to go.

966
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:04,050
But these ones you guys have all seen before.

967
00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:05,070
You guys.

968
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:05,830
You know how much...

969
00:40:05,830 --> 00:40:08,070
You only have two dollars on me at all times.

970
00:40:08,270 --> 00:40:09,050
You have shoes.

971
00:40:09,770 --> 00:40:11,430
I'm gonna take your shoes, Marshall.

972
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:16,370
Those are some...

973
00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:16,670
Those...

974
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:16,910
Alright.

975
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:17,450
So...

976
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:18,530
We have two, three more.

977
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:20,270
All you guys know, the last three.

978
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:20,730
All three.

979
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:26,850
I don't know if you guys know the last three that we have, but the classic butthurt for every follow that you guys give me.

980
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:28,010
Have a butthurt, guys.

981
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:38,750
And then, the clapping one that I've painfully learned throughout my years being a manufactured anime girl.

982
00:40:42,490 --> 00:40:48,590
My mama fed me many, many clapping algorithms and I finally learned the right way to clap.

983
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:50,150
I finally learned it, guys.

984
00:40:50,370 --> 00:40:51,810
I finally learned to clap, guys.

985
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:53,130
Are you guys proud of me?

986
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:56,110
The clap immersion!

987
00:40:57,130 --> 00:40:59,450
And finally, the last one.

988
00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:03,030
The very last animation I have is the dance one.

989
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:06,490
And I've shown... I'm dancing.

990
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:07,930
I'm dancing.

991
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:11,350
Let's put some music on.

992
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:12,410
I'm dancing.

993
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:14,510
I'm dancing.

994
00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:18,270
Alright, you guys want to see the entire...

995
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:21,430
Look at the rest of the body while I dance.

996
00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:24,090
While I do a little shimmy.

997
00:41:24,170 --> 00:41:26,770
So, this is the rest of the body, guys.

998
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:27,470
Guys!

999
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:28,970
Stop repeating the same ones!

1000
00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:30,010
I don't have it!

1001
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:31,150
I don't have it enabled!

1002
00:41:33,270 --> 00:41:37,150
I don't know where... I don't know where my hands... my other hand are.

1003
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:39,510
My clip-on hand to do that redeem.

1004
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:43,090
I don't know where it is, but this is the rest of the body.

1005
00:41:43,290 --> 00:41:44,150
So, guys...

1006
00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:46,790
Anyway, I can show you guys a better...

1007
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:48,570
A close-up.

1008
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:49,010
A close-up of this.

1009
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:50,430
So...

1010
00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:52,090
So here...

1011
00:41:52,090 --> 00:41:52,850
Here's my face.

1012
00:41:53,230 --> 00:41:54,010
And then...

1013
00:41:54,010 --> 00:41:54,630
This is Mini-Me.

1014
00:41:56,990 --> 00:41:58,550
Little details here.

1015
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:00,010
Little details.

1016
00:42:00,090 --> 00:42:00,750
Little gloves.

1017
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:02,090
My little gloves.

1018
00:42:02,170 --> 00:42:06,530
I gotta have good gloves to climb buildings and steal your cat.

1019
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:08,070
And then rename your cat.

1020
00:42:08,310 --> 00:42:09,390
And now he's my cat.

1021
00:42:09,770 --> 00:42:11,570
And then this is my little Cheeto bag.

1022
00:42:11,850 --> 00:42:12,390
I'm sorry.

1023
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:12,830
I mean...

1024
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:17,010
I mean...

1025
00:42:17,010 --> 00:42:18,570
My little lockpick.

1026
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:18,970
My little lockpicking bag.

1027
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:20,190
That is also...

1028
00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:23,570
That also substitute as a snacky bag.

1029
00:42:23,930 --> 00:42:25,910
And then there is my leggies.

1030
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:27,110
My little boots.

1031
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:28,150
My little...

1032
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:29,130
Reinforced.

1033
00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:30,610
It's very reinforced for climbing.

1034
00:42:35,570 --> 00:42:37,390
So that was...

1035
00:42:38,610 --> 00:42:41,870
That was my entire body there.

1036
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:43,530
Plus my Cheeto bag.

1037
00:42:43,710 --> 00:42:44,170
Plus the...

1038
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:46,530
Plus the Cheeto bag.

1039
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:47,710
Alright, guys.

1040
00:42:47,850 --> 00:42:48,490
What's next?

1041
00:42:48,530 --> 00:42:48,570
I'm gonna...

1042
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:49,090
What's next after that?

1043
00:42:49,210 --> 00:42:50,070
Well chat.

1044
00:42:50,370 --> 00:42:50,910
Well chat.

1045
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:54,090
There's actually some announcements coming up.

1046
00:42:54,270 --> 00:43:01,690
But before I do my announcements, my special announcements, let me sing you guys a little song.

1047
00:43:04,050 --> 00:43:06,430
I don't know how well this is gonna go out.

1048
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:08,310
But I hope it's okay.

1049
00:43:08,730 --> 00:43:12,810
But I need to be right back real quick so I can set it up for you guys.

1050
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:15,450
So give me a sec, guys, as I be right back again.

1051
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:26,520
Hello, everyone.

1052
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:27,020
Hello, everyone.

1053
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:27,860
Oh, there's my USB.

1054
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:29,000
My USB 2...

1055
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,540
1 gigabyte 2.0 flash drive.

1056
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:33,220
Alright, we don't need you anymore.

1057
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:34,440
I can throw you away now.

1058
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:38,660
Alright, guys.

1059
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:39,320
Let me...

1060
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:40,280
Let me put...

1061
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:40,880
Get the...

1062
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:42,860
Let me get the mic real quick.

1063
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:44,660
Let me get it out of my pocket.

1064
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:50,040
And let me give myself some...

1065
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:52,480
Some much needed...

1066
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,620
Much needed reverb.

1067
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:56,320
Reverb.

1068
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:56,460
Reverb.

1069
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:57,000
Reverb.

1070
00:45:57,020 --> 00:45:57,420
Echo.

1071
00:45:58,140 --> 00:45:58,580
Echo.

1072
00:45:59,300 --> 00:45:59,740
Echo.

1073
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:05,180
Yeah, it also fits my mic, too.

1074
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:05,780
My little...

1075
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:06,780
My snacky bag.

1076
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:07,620
My...

1077
00:46:07,620 --> 00:46:10,800
My snacky bag actually fits my mic as well.

1078
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:11,340
It's a...

1079
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:12,040
It's retractable.

1080
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:13,120
It's a retractable mic.

1081
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:14,720
You know, like magicians.

1082
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:16,520
You know how magicians fit those, like...

1083
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:18,300
Put his rabbits in their pockets?

1084
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:19,180
That's how they do it.

1085
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:20,680
Rabbits are retractable too.

1086
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:22,140
Please do not test that out.

1087
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:23,360
Only...

1088
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:25,100
Only magician rabbits can do it.

1089
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:27,000
And I appreciate you guys for watching.

1090
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,220
I just don't own Magician Rabbits.

1091
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:30,480
Anyway guys, mmm...

1092
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:32,600
So, technically...

1093
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:34,720
Let me turn the music off.

1094
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,680
Um, we're gonna be doing one song.

1095
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:38,820
And...

1096
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:40,660
Um...

1097
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:41,600
But...

1098
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:42,620
Oh my gosh.

1099
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:45,800
It was very hard picking the one song that I wanted to sing for you guys.

1100
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:48,600
It was very hard, because I wanted it to be a good song.

1101
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:53,260
That will... that will be what I want to share with you guys for the announcements.

1102
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:54,380
So...

1103
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:58,180
So, it was very hard picking this song.

1104
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:00,560
And I feel like I'm not gonna do very well...

1105
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:02,280
Uh... on this song.

1106
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:04,340
Because there's like this very high note.

1107
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:06,480
One for a specific line.

1108
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:08,300
And I might just sing it lower.

1109
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:10,020
Like, it might not fit the tune.

1110
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:11,020
But that's okay.

1111
00:47:15,790 --> 00:47:17,990
I might need to sing it lower.

1112
00:47:18,110 --> 00:47:19,170
But that's okay.

1113
00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:21,890
As long as... all that matters...

1114
00:47:22,370 --> 00:47:23,690
Is that I got a C.

1115
00:47:27,290 --> 00:47:28,850
That's all that matters, guys.

1116
00:47:29,870 --> 00:47:30,310
Alright.

1117
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:31,310
So, this...

1118
00:47:31,310 --> 00:47:33,030
Let me just get ready.

1119
00:47:33,170 --> 00:47:33,730
Are you guys ready?

1120
00:47:35,010 --> 00:47:36,410
Are you guys... I'm singing it lower.

1121
00:47:36,890 --> 00:47:38,470
There's no way I'm singing the high note.

1122
00:47:38,590 --> 00:47:41,070
There's no way I can sing the high note for this.

1123
00:47:41,430 --> 00:47:42,310
Are you guys ready?

1124
00:47:42,530 --> 00:47:44,350
Alright, let me do one last hydration.

1125
00:47:44,510 --> 00:47:45,730
And then we'll do the song.

1126
00:47:48,590 --> 00:47:49,030
Okay.

1127
00:47:50,290 --> 00:47:51,170
I'm so nervous.

1128
00:47:51,470 --> 00:47:52,430
I'm so nervous, guys.

1129
00:47:52,590 --> 00:47:53,750
I'm really, really nervous.

1130
00:47:58,030 --> 00:47:58,830
Okay.

1131
00:47:58,830 --> 00:48:26,710
Today, we'll have our last conversation And drink our last cup of coffee Someday We might be 80 And think about the different things we used to say All the memories of you will just become A ghost of a smile Caught in the wind Someday The day will be the last day.

1132
00:48:40,190 --> 00:48:44,290
I won't forget how it feels to be loved.

1133
00:48:45,110 --> 00:48:49,370
To be remembered by someone as special as you.

1134
00:48:49,370 --> 00:48:59,610
Someday, I will drink that last cup of coffee with a smile.

1135
00:49:04,950 --> 00:49:10,390
So, the reason why I chose this specific song...

1136
00:49:10,390 --> 00:49:12,870
Let me turn off the reverb real quick.

1137
00:49:13,990 --> 00:49:17,890
So the very first announcement that I wanted to tell you guys...

1138
00:49:17,890 --> 00:49:18,650
I hope the reverb's off.

1139
00:49:18,650 --> 00:49:20,710
The very first announcement...

1140
00:49:23,250 --> 00:49:25,130
That I wanted to show you guys.

1141
00:49:29,290 --> 00:49:31,410
I'll be graduating on May 14.

1142
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:40,740
But that means I have one month with you guys left.

1143
00:49:41,340 --> 00:49:43,880
So I have four weeks with all of you.

1144
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:46,560
And that's why I chose this song.

1145
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:52,100
It must be a surprise for all of you.

1146
00:49:57,780 --> 00:50:00,860
And that was why I was very, very nervous.

1147
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:04,500
It wasn't because of the scuff powerpoint.

1148
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:06,580
It's because I had to announce this for you all.

1149
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,180
So you guys are...

1150
00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:12,960
You might be very...

1151
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:14,440
Let me put the song back on.

1152
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:16,620
Let's have a jazzy tune to it.

1153
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:18,280
Let's have a jazzy tune to it.

1154
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:20,200
This is not a sad event, guys.

1155
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:20,980
I know it's...

1156
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:22,980
I mean it is a sad event.

1157
00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:24,480
But let's make it a happy one.

1158
00:50:24,740 --> 00:50:26,220
Let's make it a happy one.

1159
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:28,660
What do you mean you're graduating on May 14?

1160
00:50:29,020 --> 00:50:35,240
What I mean is that I will be stopping all of the YouTuber activities after my final stream on May 14.

1161
00:50:35,580 --> 00:50:37,660
So May 14 will be my final stream.

1162
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:42,940
And I will be stopping all content creations and all streaming activities then.

1163
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:43,740
One...

1164
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:45,140
This is the last hiatus.

1165
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:46,780
Will I ever come back?

1166
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:47,420
Who knows?

1167
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:58,100
So what does that mean about Twitch Partner and all of that?

1168
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:01,880
Because we all know I try to apply Twitch Partner like three separate times.

1169
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:04,800
Well, I don't think it's fair for me to...

1170
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:08,760
To reapply for Twitch Partner after this announcement.

1171
00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:11,440
Only because I know the people...

1172
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:13,720
The extra people are going to watch me after that.

1173
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:15,400
And they'll be like, She's retiring!

1174
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:16,920
She's retiring!

1175
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:19,040
She's leaving!

1176
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:20,640
Gotta watch it!

1177
00:51:20,820 --> 00:51:23,140
And I feel like those numbers might not be...

1178
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:24,180
Ah...

1179
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:25,060
It won't be...

1180
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:26,300
For me.

1181
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:27,660
So I won't...

1182
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:28,180
I will be...

1183
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:31,740
I will be refraining from applying for Twitch Partner after that.

1184
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:33,000
Um...

1185
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:33,880
So this is...

1186
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:35,660
But I'm not here for that.

1187
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:36,740
I'm not here for Twitch Partner.

1188
00:51:36,820 --> 00:51:37,740
I'm here for you guys.

1189
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:41,040
This is why I'm streaming an extra month for all of you too.

1190
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:43,100
Because I wanna spend the last...

1191
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:45,100
The last four weeks with all of you.

1192
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:47,960
And end it with style.

1193
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:53,120
So...

1194
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:54,880
Also this is why it took me so long.

1195
00:51:54,940 --> 00:51:56,920
Because I had to do a real PowerPoint after the...

1196
00:51:56,920 --> 00:52:00,140
The scuffed PowerPoint that took me way longer than I thought it would.

1197
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:04,460
The scuffed ass PowerPoint that I did took me like...

1198
00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:05,900
Two to three days to do.

1199
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:14,800
But this also took me two to three days to make.

1200
00:52:14,980 --> 00:52:16,020
So please...

1201
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:17,680
Please appreciate...

1202
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:20,460
Please appreciate the real PowerPoint too.

1203
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:23,880
There's no cool ass transition.

1204
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:25,380
Just a little...

1205
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:25,800
Little...

1206
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:25,980
Alright.

1207
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:27,460
So the next slide after this.

1208
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:28,560
Boop.

1209
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:30,440
So why are you leaving?

1210
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:31,740
What happened?

1211
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:34,240
So do you guys remember how I say...

1212
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:35,780
I'm allowed to...

1213
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:35,880
I'm allowed to...

1214
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:38,900
Rob banks and museums once a year?

1215
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,880
So I fucked up and I robbed a bank twice.

1216
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:50,040
So I read you guys the letter that the bank sent me.

1217
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:51,720
Dear...

1218
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:53,040
Dear Doki Bird.

1219
00:52:53,260 --> 00:52:56,400
The bank takes its customers promises very seriously.

1220
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:58,800
On April 16th, 2021.

1221
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:02,280
You and your rabbit minions have robbed the establishment.

1222
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:05,720
Breaking the one heist per year agreement in our contract.

1223
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:07,640
As per our terms of services.

1224
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:13,180
The authorities have been contacted and will arrive at the current given address.

1225
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:15,980
Listed in the records you've given us in one month's time.

1226
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:17,700
If you're unsure what to do.

1227
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:20,660
Please don't hesitate to contact our support team.

1228
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,340
Regards, the bank team.

1229
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:25,100
I also censored your phone number.

1230
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:27,300
So we guys will call them and be like, release her now.

1231
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:35,380
And then you guys must be wondering.

1232
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:36,800
Why did you give them your address?

1233
00:53:37,060 --> 00:53:38,300
Well, they let me rob them.

1234
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:39,820
So I figured this was a fair deal.

1235
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:41,900
I figured...

1236
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:43,980
Please update your windows and stop.

1237
00:53:44,580 --> 00:53:44,980
Now!

1238
00:53:46,380 --> 00:53:48,460
I barely know what 2 times 8 is.

1239
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:49,900
Do you think I know how to update my windows?

1240
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:50,700
Guys.

1241
00:53:56,950 --> 00:53:57,350
So...

1242
00:53:57,350 --> 00:53:58,150
So yeah.

1243
00:53:58,290 --> 00:53:59,350
I gave them my address.

1244
00:53:59,410 --> 00:54:00,310
Because I thought, you know.

1245
00:54:00,490 --> 00:54:01,870
Like, can you let me rob you?

1246
00:54:01,910 --> 00:54:03,270
I might as well give you my address.

1247
00:54:03,610 --> 00:54:04,830
And I mean...

1248
00:54:04,830 --> 00:54:05,430
I could...

1249
00:54:05,430 --> 00:54:06,810
You could just be like, why don't you move?

1250
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:07,950
With what money?

1251
00:54:08,130 --> 00:54:10,290
I already spent all the money I used on...

1252
00:54:10,290 --> 00:54:12,790
I used from robbing the bank the second time.

1253
00:54:13,010 --> 00:54:13,990
Where do I go?

1254
00:54:16,150 --> 00:54:22,470
Do you know my rabbit minions are accustomed to a very, very, very expensive standard now?

1255
00:54:25,070 --> 00:54:28,510
They order Uber Eats every single day, guys.

1256
00:54:28,830 --> 00:54:30,370
Do you know that's where all the money goes?

1257
00:54:30,690 --> 00:54:32,410
That's where all the money is going.

1258
00:54:34,750 --> 00:54:36,430
They have my credit card.

1259
00:54:36,490 --> 00:54:36,790
I'm so sorry.

1260
00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:41,810
I think I'm the minion all along.

1261
00:54:42,010 --> 00:54:43,190
I don't know about you guys.

1262
00:54:43,270 --> 00:54:44,810
I think I realized I...

1263
00:54:44,810 --> 00:54:47,410
Maybe I'm their minion all along.

1264
00:54:48,130 --> 00:54:48,650
So...

1265
00:54:49,330 --> 00:54:51,790
So the authorities have given me a one month...

1266
00:54:52,630 --> 00:54:54,730
One month's time with you, all of you.

1267
00:54:54,890 --> 00:54:57,070
And we're gonna make it a great month.

1268
00:54:57,370 --> 00:54:57,850
Alright.

1269
00:54:57,910 --> 00:54:59,370
So now you guys are wondering...

1270
00:55:00,190 --> 00:55:01,450
What's in plan?

1271
00:55:01,530 --> 00:55:03,810
What's in store for the next four weeks?

1272
00:55:04,110 --> 00:55:05,350
Well then, guys.

1273
00:55:05,530 --> 00:55:06,130
Well then.

1274
00:55:06,130 --> 00:55:07,330
Ba-dum!

1275
00:55:09,770 --> 00:55:13,010
So, I have closed down the Curious Cat.

1276
00:55:13,150 --> 00:55:15,890
We will not be using Curious Cat anymore from then...

1277
00:55:15,890 --> 00:55:16,910
After the stream.

1278
00:55:17,130 --> 00:55:19,470
And I have opened a Marshmallow...

1279
00:55:19,470 --> 00:55:21,450
A Marshmallow account.

1280
00:55:21,850 --> 00:55:22,910
So it's...

1281
00:55:22,910 --> 00:55:23,910
It's just Jokey Bird.

1282
00:55:25,930 --> 00:55:28,530
And I won't be reading any of the messages.

1283
00:55:28,690 --> 00:55:29,870
Because these are like...

1284
00:55:29,870 --> 00:55:31,330
You can send them anonymously too.

1285
00:55:31,630 --> 00:55:32,190
So...

1286
00:55:32,970 --> 00:55:35,030
These will be the messages you can send me...

1287
00:55:35,030 --> 00:55:37,270
For me to read on my final stream.

1288
00:55:37,490 --> 00:55:38,550
Which will be in four weeks.

1289
00:55:38,870 --> 00:55:39,810
And it's just...

1290
00:55:39,810 --> 00:55:42,790
Marshmallow-QA.com Slash Jokey Bird.

1291
00:55:42,870 --> 00:55:44,090
Some of you guys must be wondering...

1292
00:55:45,130 --> 00:55:46,190
Can I also get my...

1293
00:55:46,190 --> 00:55:47,430
Also that too.

1294
00:55:47,470 --> 00:55:48,650
Can I also get my $80 back?

1295
00:55:48,770 --> 00:55:50,890
Sorry, the Rabbits already spent it on Dairy Queen.

1296
00:55:51,190 --> 00:55:53,130
I don't make the rules.

1297
00:55:57,530 --> 00:55:57,970
So...

1298
00:55:58,450 --> 00:55:59,630
If you guys are wondering...

1299
00:55:59,630 --> 00:56:00,850
But it's all in Japanese.

1300
00:56:01,270 --> 00:56:02,350
Miss Jokey...

1301
00:56:02,350 --> 00:56:03,030
Quotation...

1302
00:56:03,030 --> 00:56:03,570
Maple...

1303
00:56:03,570 --> 00:56:04,130
Quotation...

1304
00:56:04,130 --> 00:56:04,350
Bird.

1305
00:56:04,590 --> 00:56:05,010
Well, I'm not gonna say anything.

1306
00:56:05,010 --> 00:56:06,870
Well, just use Google Translate.

1307
00:56:11,090 --> 00:56:12,790
Just use Google Translate.

1308
00:56:13,850 --> 00:56:14,730
But it's just...

1309
00:56:14,730 --> 00:56:16,990
It's the same as function as Curious Cat.

1310
00:56:17,150 --> 00:56:18,490
It's like a little box there.

1311
00:56:18,510 --> 00:56:18,970
It will be like...

1312
00:56:18,970 --> 00:56:19,710
Ask any question.

1313
00:56:19,890 --> 00:56:21,330
And then you can write like...

1314
00:56:21,330 --> 00:56:21,950
I don't know...

1315
00:56:21,950 --> 00:56:23,450
Like a seven-page essay or whatever.

1316
00:56:23,730 --> 00:56:24,870
And then click submit.

1317
00:56:24,990 --> 00:56:25,650
And then bam.

1318
00:56:25,770 --> 00:56:26,610
Bada bing bada boom.

1319
00:56:26,670 --> 00:56:27,210
There you go.

1320
00:56:30,950 --> 00:56:31,390
Alright.

1321
00:56:31,530 --> 00:56:32,670
So what else is there?

1322
00:56:32,790 --> 00:56:34,350
Well, at the end of the stream...

1323
00:56:35,010 --> 00:56:37,050
I'll be setting up several Discord channels.

1324
00:56:37,350 --> 00:56:37,830
So...

1325
00:56:37,830 --> 00:56:38,930
B-movie script.

1326
00:56:39,910 --> 00:56:43,890
I don't know if the algorithm is gonna allow you to submit the B-movie script.

1327
00:56:45,590 --> 00:56:47,210
But the last...

1328
00:56:47,210 --> 00:56:47,610
So the...

1329
00:56:47,610 --> 00:56:50,910
After the stream, I'll be opening several Discord channels.

1330
00:56:51,350 --> 00:56:52,990
One of them will be karaoke suggestions.

1331
00:56:53,470 --> 00:56:54,270
We're gonna have...

1332
00:56:56,190 --> 00:56:59,810
I think like one or two karaoke nights in the four weeks.

1333
00:56:59,970 --> 00:57:02,890
And I'll sing some of the songs that you guys suggest for me.

1334
00:57:03,070 --> 00:57:04,990
So some of them will be like songs I wanna sing.

1335
00:57:05,010 --> 00:57:07,170
Some of them will be songs you guys want me to sing.

1336
00:57:07,530 --> 00:57:07,930
So...

1337
00:57:07,930 --> 00:57:11,150
It doesn't guarantee that I'll sing the songs.

1338
00:57:11,450 --> 00:57:13,950
But I'll select some of them.

1339
00:57:14,130 --> 00:57:18,730
So there will be like one or two days where I'll be doing karaoke nights for all of you.

1340
00:57:19,070 --> 00:57:21,390
And another thing will be variety.

1341
00:57:22,250 --> 00:57:25,930
So there must be a lot of games you guys want me to stream before I go...

1342
00:57:25,930 --> 00:57:26,910
Before I graduate.

1343
00:57:27,330 --> 00:57:30,470
And I'll also be opening a Discord server for that as well.

1344
00:57:30,630 --> 00:57:34,650
So you can drop down any suggestions that you want me to play before I go.

1345
00:57:34,730 --> 00:57:34,990
And those will be...

1346
00:57:34,990 --> 00:57:35,450
I'm going to play this for weeks.

1347
00:57:36,030 --> 00:57:38,630
Like I said, it doesn't guarantee that I'll pick them.

1348
00:57:38,950 --> 00:57:39,950
But we'll see.

1349
00:57:40,010 --> 00:57:40,230
We'll see.

1350
00:57:40,310 --> 00:57:44,210
Because we can't do chatting and Apex streams all the time.

1351
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:50,730
So I'll stream some of the games you guys want me to play.

1352
00:57:52,070 --> 00:57:53,450
And then the postcards.

1353
00:57:53,790 --> 00:57:56,490
April and May postcards will still be in effect.

1354
00:57:56,630 --> 00:58:00,030
I actually got the April postcards today.

1355
00:58:00,130 --> 00:58:02,430
I received it like an hour before I started streaming.

1356
00:58:02,430 --> 00:58:05,010
So for those of you who don't know what the postcards are...

1357
00:58:06,350 --> 00:58:14,930
Every end of the month, the top 5 gifters get a little postcard sent from me with little goodies inside.

1358
00:58:15,350 --> 00:58:17,590
And so I'll still be doing the last 2 months.

1359
00:58:18,250 --> 00:58:22,590
But I'll be stopping the last postcard on May.

1360
00:58:22,730 --> 00:58:23,930
On May 14th.

1361
00:58:23,930 --> 00:58:25,070
Which is my final stream.

1362
00:58:26,410 --> 00:58:26,850
FlyChan!

1363
00:58:26,850 --> 00:58:29,170
Thank you so much for the raid, FlyChan!

1364
00:58:29,490 --> 00:58:30,210
Thank you!

1365
00:58:30,330 --> 00:58:31,990
I hope you had a great stream playing Apex!

1366
00:58:32,610 --> 00:58:33,550
Thank you, thank you!

1367
00:58:34,410 --> 00:58:37,110
So yeah, I'll show you guys the April postcard design.

1368
00:58:37,510 --> 00:58:39,430
I think it's after this slide.

1369
00:58:39,510 --> 00:58:41,490
So I'll show you guys the design for April.

1370
00:58:41,590 --> 00:58:45,310
And I really love it too because it's like a celebration day view postcard.

1371
00:58:47,090 --> 00:58:47,890
Sub games!

1372
00:58:48,170 --> 00:58:50,090
I will be hosting sub games!

1373
00:58:51,190 --> 00:58:52,750
I don't know if it will be on stream.

1374
00:58:53,010 --> 00:58:56,270
But I do want to spend the most I can with my community before I go.

1375
00:58:56,610 --> 00:59:00,550
So I will also be opening a channel for that.

1376
00:59:00,590 --> 00:59:02,370
For you guys to suggest some sub games.

1377
00:59:02,430 --> 00:59:09,250
So I guess like Apex, Jackbox, what else can we play together?

1378
00:59:15,850 --> 00:59:17,170
I don't know.

1379
00:59:17,270 --> 00:59:19,790
But whatever you guys suggest, I'll look into it.

1380
00:59:19,870 --> 00:59:27,890
Because I want to host like maybe like 2-3 sub game nights before I graduate.

1381
00:59:28,550 --> 00:59:29,850
And then movie night!

1382
00:59:30,010 --> 00:59:31,750
Because I'll be leaving in 4 weeks.

1383
00:59:31,750 --> 00:59:33,770
We usually are going to have 2 movie nights.

1384
00:59:34,470 --> 00:59:39,050
For those of you who don't know, we have a movie night tomorrow at 10pm PST on a Saturday.

1385
00:59:39,270 --> 00:59:41,970
We're going to be watching Raya, The Last Dragon.

1386
00:59:42,830 --> 00:59:49,190
But because we have 4 weeks left together, I'll be hosting a movie night every Saturday.

1387
00:59:49,530 --> 00:59:52,690
So I don't know what the other movies are going to be for the next 3 weeks.

1388
00:59:53,070 --> 00:59:54,930
But I hope you guys will be excited!

1389
00:59:55,370 --> 00:59:59,870
Because I love watching movies with all of you on every Saturday and Sunday.

1390
01:00:00,730 --> 01:00:01,730
It's always a good thing.

1391
01:00:01,750 --> 01:00:03,330
And I love to create time because I say dumb stuff.

1392
01:00:03,670 --> 01:00:05,690
And you guys enable me.

1393
01:00:08,430 --> 01:00:09,050
Shop!

1394
01:00:09,590 --> 01:00:10,670
Ah, Michael.

1395
01:00:10,950 --> 01:00:11,990
Michael, Michael, Michael.

1396
01:00:12,750 --> 01:00:13,810
Good timing!

1397
01:00:14,230 --> 01:00:23,750
So, also another reason why I have to announce this early is because I promised all of you that I will do merch.

1398
01:00:24,070 --> 01:00:33,190
But it would be pretty awkward if I open merch orders and then like 4 weeks later, I'm like, Hey, by the way guys, I'm leaving.

1399
01:00:35,630 --> 01:00:39,390
And then you all be like, but I bought your merch, you can't just leave!

1400
01:00:39,790 --> 01:00:45,070
So now I give you guys like, you know, you guys have some time to like decide if you want to buy merch or not.

1401
01:00:47,910 --> 01:00:50,930
And that's another reason why I had to announce it early.

1402
01:00:51,330 --> 01:00:57,850
Because I didn't want to, I didn't want to like, you know, like be like, make you buy merch and then be like, I'm leaving!

1403
01:00:58,910 --> 01:00:59,470
I'm leaving!

1404
01:00:59,470 --> 01:01:01,530
So this is alright.

1405
01:01:01,670 --> 01:01:09,650
I can like release the merch on the same day as I announce, as I announce my graduation day.

1406
01:01:10,290 --> 01:01:14,130
So, and that's why we also have 4 weeks at the end of the very end.

1407
01:01:17,170 --> 01:01:25,550
So after this, after May 7th, all these items, the merch for, the items for merch will never be released again.

1408
01:01:25,630 --> 01:01:27,450
So they are technically limited edition.

1409
01:01:33,330 --> 01:01:38,370
And yeah, so for the merch, for the merch, I tried very hard to price them reasonably.

1410
01:01:38,670 --> 01:01:40,730
Because I didn't want to make profit off you guys.

1411
01:01:40,890 --> 01:01:46,050
I tried to like, but I still wanted to like make sure I don't like lose too much money in general.

1412
01:01:46,290 --> 01:01:48,830
Because like, shipping is like really really expensive.

1413
01:01:50,990 --> 01:01:53,390
But it's a lot cheaper than usual merch.

1414
01:01:53,510 --> 01:01:58,150
It's a lot cheaper because I, I just calculated like production cost and like shipping.

1415
01:01:58,150 --> 01:02:01,730
And because all the items were shipped by, from me.

1416
01:02:01,890 --> 01:02:05,930
Like it's not from like a separate company that's doing it from, for you, for you guys.

1417
01:02:06,050 --> 01:02:07,390
It's, I'm shipping it myself.

1418
01:02:07,770 --> 01:02:09,990
And I'm contacting the manufacturers myself.

1419
01:02:10,330 --> 01:02:13,910
So it's very, it was like a lot much more work trying to calculate prices and everything.

1420
01:02:13,990 --> 01:02:14,890
Because I have to do it all myself.

1421
01:02:15,310 --> 01:02:16,670
And, but then, but!

1422
01:02:16,790 --> 01:02:20,430
I wanted to do it all myself because I wanted to include a little personal note.

1423
01:02:20,650 --> 01:02:21,950
So all of the orders.

1424
01:02:23,450 --> 01:02:26,750
And, and some little personal gifts from me to you guys.

1425
01:02:26,830 --> 01:02:28,130
For those who would like to purchase.

1426
01:02:28,130 --> 01:02:29,610
The merch and stuff.

1427
01:02:30,270 --> 01:02:33,010
So, I know I might lose money in the end.

1428
01:02:33,130 --> 01:02:39,990
Because I, I feel like I did price it like, like it might be like, I might lose money in the end.

1429
01:02:40,050 --> 01:02:40,630
But that's okay.

1430
01:02:41,050 --> 01:02:41,790
That's okay.

1431
01:02:41,810 --> 01:02:42,450
It's for you guys.

1432
01:02:42,590 --> 01:02:43,570
I did this for you guys.

1433
01:02:43,830 --> 01:02:45,270
And I promise the promise.

1434
01:02:45,590 --> 01:02:48,210
And I hope you guys think the prices are reasonable.

1435
01:02:48,410 --> 01:02:54,770
Because I spent like, I, I need you guys to know that I spent like 10 straight hours just figuring out prices in general.

1436
01:02:55,150 --> 01:02:55,450
So...

1437
01:02:57,170 --> 01:02:58,110
So please, I'm sorry.

1438
01:02:58,130 --> 01:02:59,170
Appreciate me.

1439
01:03:00,450 --> 01:03:01,870
Appreciate my hard work.

1440
01:03:03,790 --> 01:03:05,850
Yeah, shipping in Canada is very weird too.

1441
01:03:05,950 --> 01:03:09,510
Like it was very complicated trying to figure out the shipping and everything.

1442
01:03:09,690 --> 01:03:13,710
Especially when you don't have the items to like get the quotes and everything.

1443
01:03:14,170 --> 01:03:17,670
Um, like I had to like, I had to like ask people around.

1444
01:03:17,750 --> 01:03:20,210
Be like, hey you shipped like dockies before.

1445
01:03:20,390 --> 01:03:22,090
How much do they weigh?

1446
01:03:26,220 --> 01:03:26,960
You know.

1447
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:30,020
I've been stealing money for so long now.

1448
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:32,260
I think for the first time in my life.

1449
01:03:32,660 --> 01:03:34,120
I want to give back.

1450
01:03:34,740 --> 01:03:36,440
Is this an epiphany?

1451
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:37,340
I don't know.

1452
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:44,720
And the final note for this slide is the fan tag.

1453
01:03:45,140 --> 01:03:47,620
Um, it is the Bark Knights.

1454
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:49,420
As it should be.

1455
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:50,620
As it should be.

1456
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:52,580
So you can use this tag on Twitter.

1457
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:54,580
The hashtag of Bark Knights.

1458
01:03:54,860 --> 01:03:56,320
For like, I guess like fan.

1459
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:56,800
Like anything.

1460
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:58,760
If you guys want to like send something.

1461
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:00,220
Like fan art or whatever.

1462
01:04:00,580 --> 01:04:02,220
I'll be looking through the tags.

1463
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:03,960
At least, I guess everyday.

1464
01:04:05,180 --> 01:04:06,960
I'll be looking through the tags everyday.

1465
01:04:07,780 --> 01:04:09,380
And retweeting like anything.

1466
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:11,240
Um, retweetable.

1467
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:18,360
Can't believe you got to become weak on your old days.

1468
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:20,840
Are the rabbits actually siphoning my fucking energy?

1469
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:22,080
My life force?

1470
01:04:22,180 --> 01:04:22,680
Who knows?

1471
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:25,960
Alright.

1472
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:27,820
So I don't remember what the next slide is.

1473
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:29,080
But let's all see together.

1474
01:04:29,340 --> 01:04:30,740
Let's all be surprised together.

1475
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:31,240
Chat.

1476
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:32,680
Ah!

1477
01:04:33,060 --> 01:04:34,200
April's postcard!

1478
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:37,240
So this is April's postcard everyone!

1479
01:04:37,780 --> 01:04:39,480
So like I said earlier.

1480
01:04:39,580 --> 01:04:40,780
Every end of the month.

1481
01:04:40,860 --> 01:04:41,860
I do a postcard.

1482
01:04:42,220 --> 01:04:42,740
Um.

1483
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:44,540
For everyone.

1484
01:04:44,740 --> 01:04:46,600
For the top five sub-gifters.

1485
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:47,160
Uh.

1486
01:04:47,340 --> 01:04:48,280
In the community.

1487
01:04:48,740 --> 01:04:51,060
And this will be the postcard for April!

1488
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:53,220
And I usually send them.

1489
01:04:53,340 --> 01:04:54,760
I actually got this early.

1490
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:55,760
So I have.

1491
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:57,420
I actually have the cards right now on me.

1492
01:04:57,520 --> 01:04:59,960
So I'll be shipping them at the end of the month.

1493
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,180
For the top five sub-gifters.

1494
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:03,120
And they usually include like little goodies and stuff.

1495
01:05:03,140 --> 01:05:03,560
And a personal.

1496
01:05:03,740 --> 01:05:05,440
Like a little personal touch to it.

1497
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:06,140
And everything.

1498
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:07,280
So yeah.

1499
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:11,640
And there will be a May postcard.

1500
01:05:11,820 --> 01:05:12,920
But that will be a surprise.

1501
01:05:13,060 --> 01:05:14,820
Until I get the finished product.

1502
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:18,340
It will be a surprise even for me.

1503
01:05:18,460 --> 01:05:19,800
Because I don't know what it looks like too.

1504
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:20,360
So.

1505
01:05:21,340 --> 01:05:22,440
So when I get it.

1506
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:23,620
I'll show it to you guys.

1507
01:05:23,620 --> 01:05:24,340
Don't worry.

1508
01:05:24,680 --> 01:05:25,240
Um.

1509
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:26,600
Alright.

1510
01:05:26,660 --> 01:05:27,660
I'm pretty sure I have one more.

1511
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:28,660
One more slide left.

1512
01:05:28,940 --> 01:05:29,240
Ah!

1513
01:05:29,460 --> 01:05:30,160
The shop!

1514
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:31,420
The shop!

1515
01:05:31,740 --> 01:05:32,180
So.

1516
01:05:32,540 --> 01:05:33,600
So you guys are wondering.

1517
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:33,920
Huh!

1518
01:05:33,980 --> 01:05:34,880
What's in the shop?

1519
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:36,080
Well guys.

1520
01:05:36,340 --> 01:05:37,380
We have.

1521
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:38,240
The Doki.

1522
01:05:38,320 --> 01:05:39,320
The Doki Makara.

1523
01:05:39,620 --> 01:05:40,800
The acrylic stand.

1524
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:41,920
Um.

1525
01:05:42,260 --> 01:05:42,820
Stickers.

1526
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:43,980
And charms.

1527
01:05:44,740 --> 01:05:45,300
So.

1528
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:47,380
I'll be opening the store.

1529
01:05:47,780 --> 01:05:50,640
I'll be opening the store at the end of the stream.

1530
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:53,600
But it's just DokiBird.BigCardle.com.

1531
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:54,280
Um.

1532
01:05:54,460 --> 01:05:57,240
So let me give you guys a close up of all of them for all of you.

1533
01:05:57,340 --> 01:05:59,080
So this is the acrylic stand.

1534
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:00,340
And I don't remember what it price.

1535
01:06:00,420 --> 01:06:00,820
Twenty dollars.

1536
01:06:01,160 --> 01:06:02,040
So this is a six.

1537
01:06:02,060 --> 01:06:02,660
I was like.

1538
01:06:02,700 --> 01:06:03,440
What did I price it?

1539
01:06:04,340 --> 01:06:06,400
I spent so much time calculating.

1540
01:06:06,920 --> 01:06:09,480
But I don't even remember how much it cost.

1541
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:13,680
So this is the acrylic stand.

1542
01:06:13,780 --> 01:06:14,540
It's double sided.

1543
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:15,660
And it's the.

1544
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,180
And then I'm doing the butthurt.

1545
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:17,620
I'm doing.

1546
01:06:17,740 --> 01:06:18,260
Look at that.

1547
01:06:18,300 --> 01:06:18,720
I'm doing.

1548
01:06:18,940 --> 01:06:19,580
Look at that.

1549
01:06:19,620 --> 01:06:20,480
Now there's three of us.

1550
01:06:20,700 --> 01:06:21,680
There's three of us.

1551
01:06:21,820 --> 01:06:23,580
And I'm doing.

1552
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:26,840
It's a double sided.

1553
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:29,340
It's a double sided acrylic stand.

1554
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:32,060
And with a unique circular base in the background.

1555
01:06:32,120 --> 01:06:33,360
You guys always see a lot.

1556
01:06:35,320 --> 01:06:36,960
Now there's three of me.

1557
01:06:37,020 --> 01:06:38,360
Which one's the real me?

1558
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:40,260
I don't even know.

1559
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:41,640
Alright.

1560
01:06:41,740 --> 01:06:42,280
The next.

1561
01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:44,400
The next item I'll be showing you guys.

1562
01:06:44,620 --> 01:06:45,800
Are the charms.

1563
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:47,160
Are the charms.

1564
01:06:47,300 --> 01:06:47,780
This is also.

1565
01:06:48,440 --> 01:06:48,960
Um.

1566
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:49,420
Oh yeah.

1567
01:06:49,460 --> 01:06:51,940
Of course we all know who did the acrylic stand.

1568
01:06:52,040 --> 01:06:52,780
My surgeon mama.

1569
01:06:53,020 --> 01:06:53,440
Clea.

1570
01:06:55,360 --> 01:06:57,260
It was very hard trying to pick out the base.

1571
01:06:57,360 --> 01:06:57,800
But I realized.

1572
01:06:57,920 --> 01:06:58,300
You know what.

1573
01:06:58,400 --> 01:06:58,580
We all.

1574
01:06:58,740 --> 01:07:01,060
I feel like the rabbit would be much more memorable though.

1575
01:07:01,060 --> 01:07:01,580
Than the logo.

1576
01:07:01,740 --> 01:07:03,020
So I chose the rabbit in the end.

1577
01:07:03,220 --> 01:07:05,840
Cause we spent like hours trying to fucking decide.

1578
01:07:09,260 --> 01:07:10,620
One tells only lies.

1579
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:11,820
One only tells truths.

1580
01:07:11,900 --> 01:07:13,260
The third eats Cheetos.

1581
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:15,900
Alright.

1582
01:07:16,020 --> 01:07:17,040
So the next item.

1583
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:17,700
Are the.

1584
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:20,800
Are the acrylic charms.

1585
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:21,960
The acrylic.

1586
01:07:22,060 --> 01:07:23,580
It's a 2.5 double sided.

1587
01:07:23,580 --> 01:07:24,280
Acrylic charm.

1588
01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:25,580
What did I price it as?

1589
01:07:25,740 --> 01:07:26,100
Ah.

1590
01:07:26,300 --> 01:07:26,840
Eight dollars.

1591
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,340
I had to look.

1592
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:30,300
I had to look cause I don't remember.

1593
01:07:30,700 --> 01:07:31,080
I had to.

1594
01:07:31,100 --> 01:07:32,720
We all know I don't remember.

1595
01:07:32,980 --> 01:07:33,420
Numbers.

1596
01:07:34,220 --> 01:07:35,780
Whenever I see numbers.

1597
01:07:35,900 --> 01:07:36,420
I go.

1598
01:07:37,340 --> 01:07:37,780
Numbers?

1599
01:07:38,020 --> 01:07:38,420
Math?

1600
01:07:41,420 --> 01:07:42,300
Oh shit.

1601
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:42,540
What?

1602
01:07:42,760 --> 01:07:44,260
It was Michael all along.

1603
01:07:45,020 --> 01:07:46,140
Oh my god.

1604
01:07:46,660 --> 01:07:47,100
Alright.

1605
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:47,680
So yeah.

1606
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:49,020
It is a double sided.

1607
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:50,080
Acrylic charm.

1608
01:07:50,140 --> 01:07:51,820
And it's gonna come with a star collapse.

1609
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:53,180
So it has a little.

1610
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:53,560
It has a little.

1611
01:07:53,560 --> 01:07:54,500
It has a default expression.

1612
01:07:54,700 --> 01:07:55,760
And a smug expression.

1613
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:58,580
Also the reason why this took so long to do.

1614
01:07:58,660 --> 01:08:00,480
Is that I had to do all the graphics for these slides too.

1615
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:02,260
Like all the merch stuff and stuff.

1616
01:08:02,340 --> 01:08:03,080
I had to do it myself.

1617
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:03,680
So.

1618
01:08:05,460 --> 01:08:05,900
Oh.

1619
01:08:06,340 --> 01:08:06,780
Okay.

1620
01:08:07,040 --> 01:08:07,680
Pretty cool.

1621
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:09,640
Ew.

1622
01:08:09,940 --> 01:08:10,380
No.

1623
01:08:10,420 --> 01:08:10,620
No.

1624
01:08:14,700 --> 01:08:16,580
But it has a smug expression.

1625
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:19,540
And a default expression for all of you.

1626
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:20,160
Alright.

1627
01:08:20,280 --> 01:08:20,940
Next up.

1628
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:21,740
The next item.

1629
01:08:22,020 --> 01:08:23,280
Are the stickers.

1630
01:08:23,380 --> 01:08:23,540
Alright.

1631
01:08:23,560 --> 01:08:24,680
So if you guys could see.

1632
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:25,400
I didn't have.

1633
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:27,400
My friend and I didn't have enough time.

1634
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:29,300
To finish up the last two sketches.

1635
01:08:29,620 --> 01:08:30,960
But they'll be done by this week.

1636
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:31,600
I swear.

1637
01:08:31,860 --> 01:08:32,920
They'll be done by this week.

1638
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:35,880
I had so many things to do.

1639
01:08:36,220 --> 01:08:37,200
So it was like.

1640
01:08:37,420 --> 01:08:37,760
So.

1641
01:08:38,020 --> 01:08:38,500
So.

1642
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:39,880
These are three.

1643
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:41,540
They'll be three inch vinyl stickers.

1644
01:08:42,360 --> 01:08:43,980
So technically they're waterproof.

1645
01:08:44,340 --> 01:08:45,740
But I would suggest not testing.

1646
01:08:46,260 --> 01:08:46,740
Like you know.

1647
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:48,480
Like pouring water on it every day.

1648
01:08:48,740 --> 01:08:49,620
To be like.

1649
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:50,580
Is it really waterproof?

1650
01:08:50,900 --> 01:08:52,520
I would suggest not doing that.

1651
01:08:52,680 --> 01:08:53,540
But technically.

1652
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:54,500
It is waterproof.

1653
01:08:54,860 --> 01:08:56,160
But not as waterproof.

1654
01:08:56,240 --> 01:08:57,280
As you think it is.

1655
01:09:00,320 --> 01:09:02,280
So please don't pour water on it every day.

1656
01:09:02,360 --> 01:09:03,260
If it rains.

1657
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:05,240
And then you got like water on it.

1658
01:09:05,280 --> 01:09:05,620
It'll be fine.

1659
01:09:05,860 --> 01:09:07,020
But like if you like decide to be like.

1660
01:09:07,100 --> 01:09:07,520
Let me.

1661
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:08,640
Let me take these stickers out.

1662
01:09:08,680 --> 01:09:09,100
On a swim.

1663
01:09:10,860 --> 01:09:12,660
I am not responsible for that.

1664
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:18,220
So the four sticker designs are.

1665
01:09:18,340 --> 01:09:19,120
And they're three dollars.

1666
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:20,200
A sticker.

1667
01:09:20,680 --> 01:09:21,680
And a ten dollar.

1668
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:22,880
And if you want all four of them.

1669
01:09:22,940 --> 01:09:23,500
It'll be ten dollars.

1670
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:23,540
So that's it.

1671
01:09:25,620 --> 01:09:28,180
And they're like the outfits throughout the year.

1672
01:09:28,300 --> 01:09:29,420
So all the stickers are.

1673
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:32,800
Some of the outfits I've worn over the years.

1674
01:09:32,940 --> 01:09:33,420
Streaming.

1675
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:35,000
So the hello hello.

1676
01:09:37,860 --> 01:09:38,820
Hello hello.

1677
01:09:39,540 --> 01:09:40,020
Boba.

1678
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:41,100
The thief sticker.

1679
01:09:41,380 --> 01:09:42,500
And the hug sticker.

1680
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:45,760
So I hope you guys will be excited when the last two stickers are finally done.

1681
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,200
But I'll be finishing them.

1682
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:49,540
They'll be finished this week.

1683
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:50,100
So.

1684
01:09:50,220 --> 01:09:52,420
So I hope by the end of Sunday.

1685
01:09:52,460 --> 01:09:53,180
I'll have these done.

1686
01:09:54,460 --> 01:09:56,560
And then finally.

1687
01:09:57,060 --> 01:09:59,800
The one you've all been waiting for.

1688
01:10:00,020 --> 01:10:00,420
Guys.

1689
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:02,060
The daki.

1690
01:10:02,260 --> 01:10:03,620
The doki makura.

1691
01:10:05,940 --> 01:10:07,940
So they'll be double sided.

1692
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:10,120
Two way tri-cut.

1693
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:15,660
And they're 150 centimeters x 50 centimeters.

1694
01:10:15,980 --> 01:10:17,580
And they were done by Daphne.

1695
01:10:17,700 --> 01:10:18,100
Daphne?

1696
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:18,920
Daphne?

1697
01:10:20,220 --> 01:10:22,360
I have the credit on the site.

1698
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:22,780
So.

1699
01:10:22,860 --> 01:10:23,160
So.

1700
01:10:23,180 --> 01:10:24,580
It's what however you pronounce it.

1701
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:25,800
But I'm bad at pronouncing stuff.

1702
01:10:25,940 --> 01:10:26,160
So.

1703
01:10:26,620 --> 01:10:27,060
Daphne?

1704
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:27,880
Daphne?

1705
01:10:28,420 --> 01:10:28,860
Daphie.

1706
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:33,640
So.

1707
01:10:34,940 --> 01:10:37,040
And this will be $55.

1708
01:10:37,980 --> 01:10:39,520
This will be $55.

1709
01:10:40,140 --> 01:10:40,580
So.

1710
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:41,800
Anyway.

1711
01:10:42,780 --> 01:10:44,200
So those were all the.

1712
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:46,620
Those were all the merchandise that I have.

1713
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:48,180
And I think the rob the bank one.

1714
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:50,040
The rob the bank bundle.

1715
01:10:50,180 --> 01:10:52,300
For all of it is like 55.

1716
01:10:52,720 --> 01:10:53,160
Oh not 55.

1717
01:10:53,160 --> 01:10:54,920
The daki is 55.

1718
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:57,480
But the rob the bank bundle is like $85.

1719
01:10:57,660 --> 01:10:58,280
I think.

1720
01:10:58,320 --> 01:10:59,240
I don't know the numbers.

1721
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:02,000
You'll see on the website.

1722
01:11:08,330 --> 01:11:10,210
And if you guys do not know.

1723
01:11:10,330 --> 01:11:11,490
Because I wrote it in the description.

1724
01:11:11,750 --> 01:11:14,490
But every purchase will come with a postcard.

1725
01:11:14,690 --> 01:11:16,190
So the postcards that you guys.

1726
01:11:16,410 --> 01:11:16,850
Like you know.

1727
01:11:16,870 --> 01:11:18,110
Like the monthly postcards I've done.

1728
01:11:18,170 --> 01:11:19,030
I have some extras.

1729
01:11:19,330 --> 01:11:20,330
While supplies last.

1730
01:11:20,490 --> 01:11:21,290
So every purchase.

1731
01:11:21,330 --> 01:11:22,070
No matter how small.

1732
01:11:22,210 --> 01:11:23,370
Like even if you just buy one sticker.

1733
01:11:23,710 --> 01:11:24,510
I'll just give you.

1734
01:11:24,590 --> 01:11:25,370
I'll send over a rob the bank.

1735
01:11:25,390 --> 01:11:26,090
And I'll send over a random postcard.

1736
01:11:26,250 --> 01:11:28,470
From the excess ones that I got.

1737
01:11:29,270 --> 01:11:30,730
That I have on me.

1738
01:11:30,910 --> 01:11:32,170
And if you buy the bundle.

1739
01:11:32,290 --> 01:11:33,710
You get all six postcards.

1740
01:11:34,470 --> 01:11:35,090
So yeah.

1741
01:11:35,230 --> 01:11:37,110
So every purchase will come with a postcard.

1742
01:11:37,170 --> 01:11:37,770
But the bundle.

1743
01:11:37,810 --> 01:11:38,650
You get all of them.

1744
01:11:39,230 --> 01:11:40,310
Because if you buy like.

1745
01:11:40,450 --> 01:11:41,690
The singular items.

1746
01:11:41,810 --> 01:11:42,170
You'll get a.

You'll get like a random.

1749
01:11:45,670 --> 01:11:46,630
Random postcard.

1750
01:11:46,870 --> 01:11:47,530
But the bundle.

1751
01:11:47,570 --> 01:11:48,870
Will give you all six of them.

01:12:07,290 --> 01:12:09,130
The six inch acrylic stand.

Alright.

Big cart.

Have you guys ever wondered why I kept calling it lore stream?

1975
01:16:46,360 --> 01:16:48,060
Cause I think it would be weird.

1976
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:49,040
Cause I was like.

1977
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:50,480
I can't call it a debut stream.

1978
01:16:50,720 --> 01:16:52,080
Cause I'm announcing my graduation.

1979
01:16:52,920 --> 01:16:53,400

01:16:58,740 --> 01:16:59,060
I can't call it a debut stream.

1983
01:16:59,080 --> 01:17:01,220
It would be weird.

1984
01:17:01,620 --> 01:17:03,320
Cause I'll be announcing my graduation.

1985
01:17:04,220 --> 01:17:05,260
And that's why I was like.

1986
01:17:05,480 --> 01:17:06,000
Haha.

Um.

2013
01:17:36,780 --> 01:17:37,060
Without.

2014
01:17:37,240 --> 01:17:39,400
I got my Twitch payout a few days ago.

2015
01:17:39,480 --> 01:17:40,540
And I was able to.

2016
01:17:40,780 --> 01:17:44,640
I was able to fund my Doki Doge allergy treatment.

2017
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:47,600
And I'm booking an appointment with the vets.

2018
01:17:47,700 --> 01:17:49,000
At the end of the month.

2019
01:17:49,140 --> 01:17:49,960
And finally.

2020
01:17:50,340 --> 01:17:51,320
I mean he'll still be allergic.

2021
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:53,480
I mean he'll still be allergic to freaking chicken.

2022
01:17:54,100 --> 01:17:54,580
But.

2023
01:17:55,720 --> 01:17:58,520
Maybe this time he'll have fur again on his ears.

2024
01:17:58,680 --> 01:17:59,060
I don't know.

2025
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:00,320
But I think he'll be allergic.

2026
01:18:01,180 --> 01:18:01,620
But he'll be allergic to chicken.

2027
01:18:02,180 --> 01:18:02,620
And.

2028
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:04,140
It really does mean a lot.

2029
01:18:04,260 --> 01:18:05,900
Cause vet bills are so expensive.

2030
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:07,520
And it was because of you guys.

2031
01:18:07,620 --> 01:18:10,480
I was able to afford treatment for him.

2032
01:18:10,540 --> 01:18:11,100
And it really.

2033
01:18:11,140 --> 01:18:11,680
It really.

2034
01:18:11,740 --> 01:18:13,020
It does mean a lot guys.

2035
01:18:13,100 --> 01:18:14,740
Like I might not be the biggest streamer.

2036
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:16,940
I might not be like super well known.

2037
01:18:17,060 --> 01:18:18,560
But I love my community.

2038
01:18:18,980 --> 01:18:20,460
I really love you guys.

2039
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:21,420
Like everyday.

2040
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:22,400
Whenever I stream.

2041
01:18:22,520 --> 01:18:23,940
Whenever I decide to go live.

2042
01:18:24,260 --> 01:18:25,580
You guys cheer me up.

2043
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:27,220
So much.

2044
01:18:27,460 --> 01:18:27,640
Like.

2045
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:29,060
Even when I'm like.

2046
01:18:29,060 --> 01:18:30,460
I'm like, ah, do I, should I stream?

2047
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:32,460
I'll be like, I'm not feeling it, I'm not feeling streaming.

2048
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:34,760
And then I go live and I'm like, HA!

2049
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:38,840
And then you guys cheer me up so much.

2050
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:40,100
You guys really do.

2051
01:18:40,340 --> 01:18:41,880
It means a lot, everyone.

2052
01:18:42,060 --> 01:18:42,700
It really does.

2053
01:18:42,920 --> 01:18:47,760
Like, sometimes I get, feel so down and then my friends will be like, you should stream today!

2054
01:18:47,980 --> 01:18:49,180
Cause it always cheers you up.

2055
01:18:49,320 --> 01:18:50,420
And it really does.

2056
01:18:50,680 --> 01:18:51,340
It really does.

2057
01:18:51,480 --> 01:18:52,640
Are you not gonna stream anymore?

2058
01:18:52,980 --> 01:18:55,700
After May 14th will be my final stream.

2059
01:18:55,700 --> 01:18:57,680
I'll be streaming next four weeks.

2060
01:18:57,920 --> 01:19:00,640
But, uh, May 14th will be the final stream.

2061
01:19:00,780 --> 01:19:05,720
And that's when I'll be stopping all VTuber activities and content creation regarding streaming.

2062
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:07,960
Um, but I'll still be an artist.

2063
01:19:08,200 --> 01:19:10,060
I still have to make an honest living somehow.

2064
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:16,640
But it really does mean a lot.

2065
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:20,560
But I'll be setting up the servers and stuff on the Discord server.

2066
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:24,180
With like suggestions on what you guys want to see for the next four weeks.

2067
01:19:24,340 --> 01:19:25,680
And I hope to see you!

2068
01:19:25,700 --> 01:19:25,940

Um, for if you guys, for the people that can make it.

That's a secret!

2077

That'll be our little secret!

2078
01:19:46,440 --> 01:19:48,220
We'll see on the final stream.

2079
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:49,840
We'll see on the final stream.

2080
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:54,720
So that would be, I guess that would be my goodbye note for, for the stream.

2081
01:19:56,160 --> 01:19:58,400
Thank you all of you guys for coming.

2082
01:19:58,620 --> 01:20:00,380
I always, I really do appreciate it.

2083
01:20:00,520 --> 01:20:01,620
I really do.

2084
01:20:01,940 --> 01:20:03,940
Tomato Redeem will be activated.

2085
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:10,400
The Tomato Redeem with RTX on will be redeemable after this stream.

2086
01:20:10,500 --> 01:20:12,840
The next stream will have Tomato Redeems.

2087
01:20:12,900 --> 01:20:15,400
So don't worry, I will take off my skin suit for you guys.

2088
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:16,920
With the hat on, I found my hat.

2089
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:20,760
I found my hat so I'll put that on too.

2090
01:20:21,240 --> 01:20:21,820
Um, but yeah.

2091
01:20:21,980 --> 01:20:23,920
I'll see you guys next stream.

2092
01:20:24,180 --> 01:20:25,680
And make sure to give some love to the stream.

2093
01:20:25,680 --> 01:20:27,760
And give some input on what you want to see and what you want me to sing.

2094
01:20:28,280 --> 01:20:30,660
And I'll see you guys next time!
