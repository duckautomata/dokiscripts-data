1
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,900
Hello everybody!

2
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,420
Oh my god, my voice is so fucked.

3
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:48,460
Holy shit, okay.

4
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:51,480
That hello was so bad, I'm sorry.

5
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,060
I'm so fucked up right now.

6
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:57,320
But like, I really still wanted to play Silent Hill.

7
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,720
Guys, tomorrow I won't be streaming.

8
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,300
I will not.

9
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,620
I won't be streaming tomorrow, I swear.

10
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,560
Holy shit!

11
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:07,900
That was the most fucked up hello I've ever had in a while.

12
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,280
I am hydra- are you okay?

13
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:15,900
No, I am- okay, I'm gonna- I'm still sick.

14
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,420
I am still fucked up right now.

15
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,740
Okay, let me write that PSA.

16
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:30,700
PSA, I'm still sick, but that's not gonna stop me from playing Early Access!

17
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,640
Anyway, no stream tomorrow.

18
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,540
Oh my god, I'm so fucked up.

19
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:44,900
Um, I just really wanted- I really wanted to try out the Early Access.

20
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,480
I don't know how long I'll be playing for.

21
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,000
Most likely, like, I won't try to go too long.

22
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,120
Um, the reviews!

23
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:53,680
Everybody said the reviews overall has been really positive.

24
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:59,840
Everybody was do- also like, uh, dad is staying at the city for an extra day because I literally can't.

25
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:04,160
I was like- I was like, I'm not getting better as fast as I would like.

26
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:08,720
So I was like, alright, um, can you please take care of him for like an extra day?

27
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,540
And then she was like, okay.

28
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:09,880
Of course!

29
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:10,560
No problem!

30
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,560
He's been such a good boy!

31
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:19,220
And I'm just like, you fucking- I was like- I was like, you fucking traitor.

32
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,460
Fucking good boy my fucking ass.

33
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,220
Like, come on.

34
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,600
I can't believe he's been such a good boy.

35
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:31,080
Oh my god.

36
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:44,070
If I'm like, making sounds out of my mouth, but no sound- if I'm like, opening my mouth as if like, sounds are supposed to be good.

37
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:48,630
It's because I was ca- I'm coughing and I'm mooting my coughs because it's not attractive at all.

38
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:52,370
It is- it's not- it's not- it's not good.

39
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:54,510
It's- I would say it got worse.

40
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:58,790
Oh, it's a new babysitter!

41
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:01,610
I found a new babysitter to, um...

42
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:05,470
I found a new babysitter last minute because the other babysitter couldn't do it.

43
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:07,170
Because like I said, it was super last minute.

44
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:08,230
I was like, can you do it?

45
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,390
I need you by tomorrow.

46
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:10,250
And she's like, no.

47
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:12,230
So I was like, okay.

48
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:14,790
Like, what else am I gonna say?

49
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:15,870
Like, do it or else?

50
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:18,770
Or like- like, I had to find somebody else.

51
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:20,990
But yeah, um, it's a new babysitter.

52
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:23,450
She's also really a good babysitter.

53
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:26,590
She was expensive because it was last minute.

54
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:29,210
Um, but she gives free baths.

55
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:30,590
At least that's great.

56
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:35,270
Like, at least- at least she gives free baths.

57
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:37,810
Like, after how expensive it was.

58
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:40,730
Um, but, you know, I'll take that.

59
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:44,170
I'm tea dragon.

60
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:45,170
Thank you for the super chat.

61
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:46,050
Thank you, thank you.

62
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:48,450
Zoing, Stoaky, you're going through Beale Brady!

63
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:49,650
Again!

64
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,450
I really, really hope the game's good.

65
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:54,670
The original one is one of my all-time favorite.

66
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:57,570
And I love Konami didn't mess this up.

67
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:58,830
Love you new emotes, by the way.

68
00:04:58,850 --> 00:04:59,070
Yes!

69
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:01,030
We have new emotes if you guys don't know!

70
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:01,950
Yes!

71
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:03,450
Um, it was really fast.

72
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:04,730
It was by Chica.

73
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:08,310
Um, she's like really well known in the emote community.

74
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:13,830
And, um, and honestly, Honestly, I really love how they all came out.

75
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:15,550
Like, I was like, I want all of these.

76
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:17,150
And then she did them really fast.

77
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:23,930
Literally, the sketches were done like, after I proved the sketches, the emotes were done in a day after.

78
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:24,930
So I was like, yay!

79
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:28,010
We have two more slots left, by the way.

80
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:33,930
Uh, we have two more slots left for emotes, and then it's like the maximum for emotes slots.

81
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:37,290
So after those two, we filled them all up.

82
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:39,950
And then I will finally upload the emotes on Twitch.

83
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:40,530
I'm sorry.

84
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:43,030
Twitch is very neglected right now with emotes.

85
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:43,850
I'm so very sorry.

86
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:47,070
Okay.

87
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:48,770
We'll get to that soon.

88
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:52,050
Blue, thank you for your very first Super Chat!

89
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:52,390
Thank you!

90
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:55,670
Oh god, I feel like a fucking teenager right now, with my voice cracks.

91
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:59,710
Like, I am, I'm that bro who's just going through the puberty stage at the moment.

92
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:02,190
Hi Doki, first time caller, long time listener!

93
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:04,570
Uh, thank you for your very first Super Chat!

94
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:05,510
Thank you, thank you!

95
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:07,890
Alright, let's see.

96
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:09,090
Continue.

97
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:11,170
Uh...

98
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:12,650
Seems good.

99
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:14,010
The setting seems great.

100
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:15,430
Uh...

101
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:18,510
Um, I've never played a Silent Hill game before.

102
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:28,390
I told this story already, but um, like I said, um, I have had one 10-minute experience with Silent Hill.

103
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:33,670
Um, I bought the re- like, I love, I love watch- I love the movie, the first movie.

104
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:38,230
We don't talk about the second movie, but I love Silent Hill, the first Silent Hill movie.

105
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:39,530
I really enjoyed it.

106
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:44,830
Um, it's actually one of the few faithful game adaptations at that time that came out.

107
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:54,190
Like, the director, everybody loved, like, the source material and tried their best to um, tried their best to be faithful to the source material.

108
00:06:54,750 --> 00:07:04,550
The weirdest thing, the thing I hated about Silent Hill 1, uh, Silent Hill 2, is that it's Silent Hill 2, but it's based off of Silent Hill 3.

109
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:09,550
Which is understandable because Silent Hill was based off of Silent Hill...

110
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:10,150
2.

111
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:26,830
But like, it's so fucking stupid, like It's still, it's still fucking stupid that, um, um, it's just, it's such a stupid- Silent Hill 2 is such a fucking stupid movie.

112
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:27,590
Um!

113
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:28,730
Anyway!

114
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:31,850
Anyway, at least the costumes was great for Heather.

115
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:32,710
That's all I'll say.

116
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:34,730
Like, because they changed directors.

117
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:38,370
They, they changed directors, so So

118
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:41,890
I had to sneeze.

119
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:44,290
Um, they changed directors for 2 and 1.

120
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:47,130
Uh, so that's why it was a very bad movie.

121
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:48,090
I was so sad.

122
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:48,790
I didn't even watch it.

123
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:51,750
By the way, I loved Silent Hill 1 so much.

124
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:54,690
I actually went to theaters for Silent Hill 2.

125
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:57,510
But I didn't reali- I didn't Google at that time.

126
00:07:57,690 --> 00:07:59,730
I wasn't smart enough to Google the movie I'm watching.

127
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:04,010
And because I didn't Google the movie, I didn't realize they changed directors.

128
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:05,210
So yeah!

129
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:10,550
I gave the fucking- I gave the studio my money to watch Silent Hill 2 in theaters.

130
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:12,470
So, yeah.

131
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:15,490
Um, Thank you, thank you!

132
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:18,370
Uh, the Silent Hill film was really good.

133
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:21,150
I'm sure I'm glad I never got a sequel to run into the ground.

134
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:23,670
Yup, just one decent film and nothing else.

135
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:25,350
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

136
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:26,830
But Silent Hill 3!

137
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:30,550
Apparently, they brought back the old director for Silent Hill 3.

138
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:33,830
So like, it might be- it might get better.

139
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:40,690
Like, they might have fixed it by Silent Hill 3 because they got back the first Silent Hill movie director.

140
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:42,790
So, it could get better.

141
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:44,910
Um, anyway!

142
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:56,330
Like I said, the only experience I had for Silent Hill are, um, is that um, I bought the remastered trilogy.

143
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:59,950
So they had like the remastered trilogy that came out on the PlayStation.

144
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:04,050
And uh, um, I didn't want to play alone.

145
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:07,050
So, I called up one of my best friends at that time.

146
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:08,950
And I was like, can you come over to my house?

147
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:12,150
And like, and then like, like watch me play this game.

148
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,590
Or like, you play- we play this together.

149
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:16,250
And we like, you know, exchange controllers.

150
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:19,190
So then she was like, yeah, sure, no problem.

151
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:22,710
So like, um, my mom brought up all these snacks and everything.

152
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:25,190
And it was- by the way, the sun was fucking out.

153
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:28,110
We were like, let's- like, come over to my place when the sun is out.

154
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:32,250
So it would be like, you know, 1 to 2 PM or some shit.

155
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:35,090
The sun is so fucking bright, shining in.

156
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:37,030
Um, and this was when I was in Asia.

157
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:39,630
So the sun was even more intense because it was during the summer.

158
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,550
So, it was during the summer.

159
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:45,910
And then we were like, alright, let's try Silent Hill 3 because we heard it's the best one out of the trilogy.

160
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:47,790
And I was like, alright.

161
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:51,610
And then so like, we like, booted it up.

162
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:53,690
We got through the dream sequence together.

163
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:54,610
It was very rough.

164
00:09:54,770 --> 00:10:01,950
It took us like- it took us like, I think like, 20 minutes to get through the dream sequences because we kept passing the controller to each other.

165
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:05,270
So we were like, oh my god, fucking god, this is so scary.

166
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:08,490
So we kept passing the controller to each other because we were so fucking scared.

167
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,010
And the dream sequences.

168
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:13,190
And then- and then- because it was like, really fucking rough.

169
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:14,490
And then we got to the mall.

170
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:16,630
And we were like, alright, this seems great.

171
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:18,530
Like, the mall seems nice and safe.

172
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,110
And we got to the mall part.

173
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:25,070
And then those like, fucking giant ass creatures like, lumbering around in the mall started coming out.

174
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:26,170
And then we closed the game.

175
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:30,270
Um, and then we were like, let's play Epic Mickey 2.

176
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:36,370
My friend was like, oh hey, you have Epic Mickey 2.

177
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:37,210
We should play that.

178
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:38,290
And I was like, you're right.

179
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:39,150
There's multiplayer.

180
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:46,420
He was like, hey, there's multiplayer in that.

181
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,300
We should- we should play that game.

182
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,280
And I was like, yo, great idea.

183
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:52,780
Let's play Epic Mickey 2.

184
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:58,920
By the way, I bought Epic- I pre- I- I bought Epic Mickey, the remastered Epic Mickey.

185
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,820
So we're gonna play that after God of War.

186
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,520
So God of War will be after this.

187
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,720
And then after God of War, we'll play Epic Mickey.

188
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,560
Because I actually really- I never had a chance to play the first Epic Mickey.

189
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:10,940
Um, I bought the Epic Mickey 2, but I never finished it.

190
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,320
Because it was like a multiplayer game.

191
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,300
So like, but then like, my friend and I stopped playing it.

192
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,680
So then I never got to see the ending.

193
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,740
I never- we only got to like, the first level.

194
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,380
And that's it.

195
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:23,240
So I never got a chance to play Epic Mickey 1, because it was on the fucking Wii U.

196
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:25,500
It was- no, it was on the Wii.

197
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:26,820
It was on the fucking Wii.

198
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,820
And at that time, I didn't own a Wii.

199
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:31,820
So I never had a chance to experience Epic Mickey.

200
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,560
And I really want to play Epic Mickey.

201
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,080
So after God of War, we'll play Epic Mickey.

202
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,880
I never had a Wii.

203
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,200
My parents at that time was like, I fucking doubt those were kids.

204
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,160
And I was a child.

205
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,320
I was a child.

206
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,540
So like, but they were like, ew, that's for kids.

207
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,840
So I was like, I never had a chance.

208
00:11:55,400 --> 00:12:02,280
It's like, my dad at that time, he was like, if I can't play, if I can't play, nobody can play.

209
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:09,000
So I never- At that time, I never got consoles that were meant for children.

210
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:16,200
Because like, he was like, if I can't play the video- if I can't play video games on it, nobody can play video games on it.

211
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:27,100
So I never got a chance to experience- I never got a chance to experience the GameCube, the NES, um, the, uh, like, N64, the, uh, Wii.

212
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,220
I got the Wii U.

213
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:35,300
And then, I finally was able to get the Wii U, um, on my birthday.

214
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:36,840
Same with the GameCube.

215
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:41,980
The only reason why I got GameCube was because it was about- the GameCube was literally dying.

216
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,020
Like, no new games were coming out, so it was super cheap.

217
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:51,060
Because at that time, GameCube games have already- GameCube has already been discontinued, and then that's when I got a GameCube.

218
00:12:51,180 --> 00:13:03,500
So like, I had two games on the GameCube, which was- The two games I had was Animal Crossing, and- Oh wait, sorry, the three games I had was Animal Crossing, and the two- the Shadow Pokémon games.

219
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:04,400
That was it.

220
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:08,500
So like, I never got experience like, the rest of GameCube.

221
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,760
The rest of GameCube.

222
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:15,800
So, that was my life, when it comes to video games.

223
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:20,280
I could only play video games that were considered for real gamers.

224
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:29,440
And also, I never got experience Xbox games, so I never got a chance to play Halo or anything.

225
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:31,120
I've still never played a Halo before.

226
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:36,960
And because my dad was a Sony fucking fanboy, so he was like, ew Sony.

227
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,740
Until Gears of War came out.

228
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:42,140
And then when Gears of War came out, he bought an Xbox 360.

229
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:48,000
And so like, that was the only time I had a chance to experience the Xbox life.

230
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:55,060
And after that, there was never- there was never been an Xbox in my life after that.

231
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:55,940
Okay.

232
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:57,520
Um...

233
00:13:58,460 --> 00:13:59,660
Alright, is it dangerous?

234
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,160
Maybe.

235
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,160
Okay, here we go.

236
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:04,880
We're gonna- not gonna be able to get- I know there's like multiple endings for this shit.

237
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:10,520
Um, I would be very surprised if we can get any good ending in this game.

238
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:14,540
Knowing me playing- knowing me, I'd be very surprised.

239
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,900
Cause I don't remember- I know like there's like weird ass game endings with like the dog and everything and the UFOs.

240
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:26,060
But I'd be very surprised if like, I would get any good ending here.

241
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,800
Knowing me when it comes to horror game.

242
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,380
Um, alright guys.

243
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,960
Uh, should I play this with a controller?

244
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,400
Or mouse and keyboard?

245
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,740
I actually- we'll just go with mouse and keyboard for now and see how it goes.

246
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:47,120
Um, I like defaulting mouse and keyboard cause I know like the main thing about- Is this James?

247
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:49,380
Okay.

248
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:49,820
Okay.

249
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:56,560
I know I- guys, I bought the deluxe version just cause it's the only way to play it early.

250
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:03,820
But like, we're not- guys, we're not gonna have fucking- we're not gonna have pyramid head or mirror- we're not.

251
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:06,460
Guys, how am I gonna be immersed?

252
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:07,660
Guys!

253
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,120
How am I gonna be immersed?

254
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:14,920
Guys, I won't be immersed if we fucking put these on!

255
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,240
I won't take it seriously!

256
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,100
I- Okay.

257
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,980
Guys, I'm not gonna take it seriously if I have it on!

258
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:30,480
Alright.

259
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:34,900
The dog mask is gonna be less scary.

260
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:36,860
Okay, we'll put the dog mask on.

261
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:40,040
Um, we'll see how it goes with mouse and keyboard.

262
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:52,360
Cause like, you know, if I somehow miraculously get a gun, um, I feel- cause like, the whole point about Silent Hill is that you play a character who's like, a regular person.

263
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:55,120
So like, so that's what I'm worried about.

264
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:58,640
Cause like, you know, like, there's no actual combat in there.

265
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:05,840
So like, we might bump into- like, it's like really rare to like- MY IMMERSION!

266
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:06,620
Hahaha!

267
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:09,840
Noooo!

268
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,340
Okay, standard.

269
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:14,520
Uh, wait, did it reset itself?

270
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,420
The- wait, escape.

271
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,200
Did my settings res- did it not?

272
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,540
Okay, yeah, I was gonna say, like what?

273
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:25,780
It should've- Okay, I wanna make sure the- okay, okay, there we go.

274
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:37,200
Yeah, I was gonna say, why wouldn't- okay, 90's mode, uh, mirror interface, light, remote- difficult room that this option can be adjusted later.

275
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,900
Okay, if the fucking combat is too hard, we'll go easy.

276
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:42,460
If like, it's fucking me up too much.

277
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,200
Guys, please, I'm- don't do well.

278
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:49,380
I don't do well with- with horror, guys.

279
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:59,330
You put the mask on when it's too scary.

280
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:05,750
When it's too scary, turn the immersion off.

281
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,480
Hello?

282
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,520
Where am I?

283
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,200
Hello?

284
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:29,460
I don't remember- cause I, like, read- I watched so many videos about the lore of Silent Hill and everything, but I don't remember.

285
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,780
I don't remember this game.

286
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:38,220
Like, I know the basics of this game's lore, but I don't remember the- the fuck is this?

287
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:41,810
That's my impression.

288
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:57,310
They don't know who I am until I put the mask on.

289
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,860
Oh my god.

290
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,120
It's perfect.

291
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:12,560
Oh my god.

292
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,900
Y'all, why did this?

293
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:18,640
I didn't think it would start now.

294
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:19,980
Mary.

295
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,320
The

296
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:33,980
game looks promising already.

297
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,620
Oh my god, look at this asshole.

298
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,420
This entire time.

299
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:44,500
Look at his fucking ass.

300
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,420
Okay.

301
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,360
I see that town.

302
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:08,340
Mary.

303
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:19,780
Sorry, it paused because I had to- Oh, that's nice.

304
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,640
It paused so I could up the volume.

305
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,020
Here he is.

306
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,680
With his gamer headphones on.

307
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,120
Silent Hill, they set the title!

308
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,260
Title drop.

309
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:46,260
Roll credits.

310
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,000
You can't hear.

311
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:51,560
He has his headphones on.

312
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,780
Okay, let's up it a bit more.

313
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:06,080
You're a fucking whore.

314
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:06,880
I know it, James.

315
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:11,420
Even though I don't remember the lore fully of this game, I know you were a whore.

316
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,960
Why is the pyramid so fucking ripped, James?

317
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:18,800
Why is he so ripped?

318
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:23,050
Also, I upped it a little.

319
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:25,110
This whole town was our special place.

320
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:31,510
He's a- That's why he's wearing a dog mask, because he's a dog.

321
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:33,150
Is he really alive?

322
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:38,050
Yeah, because that's why the nurses are so hot and the fucking pyramid head was so fucking ripped.

323
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,600
Why does he wear the mask?

324
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,700
To hide his true self.

325
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:52,580
Whoa, okay!

326
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:55,160
The sensitivity is fucking insane.

327
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,420
Okay, give me a sec.

328
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,700
I forgot to- I forgot to lower something.

329
00:20:59,060 --> 00:20:59,340
Okay.

330
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:02,100
The sensitivity is really fucking insane.

331
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,440
Holy shit.

332
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,260
Okay, there.

333
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:06,020
That should be good.

334
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,320
Oh my god!

335
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,440
What the fuck is the sensitivity?

336
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:11,920
Okay.

337
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:17,770
Okay, 25, 30.

338
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:19,090
Okay, that should be better, right?

339
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:21,390
What the fuck?

340
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:22,110
Okay.

341
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:23,590
Give me a sec, guys.

342
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:27,450
Jesus, why- What is wrong with the sensitivity here?

343
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:29,970
Bro, it's all- It's all the way down!

344
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:33,030
I literally have it as low as it can be.

345
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:37,570
Okay, this is- This is the best I can do.

346
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:43,210
This is actually- The fog hasn't set in so I have plenty of time before things get freaky.

347
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:47,290
By the way, I already missed Team Freaky.

348
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:48,370
Team Freaky was so good.

349
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:53,770
I think Team Freaky has to be like top three best teams I've played with.

350
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:58,090
Best pro teams I've played with in a tournament setting.

351
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:01,850
And we were like talking about how like um...

352
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:04,470
Oh wait, is it- Oh, I have to change my DPI?

353
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:09,790
Bro, if I have to change my DPI outside of the game, that is a game issue.

354
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:16,710
That is- That is a fucking game issue.

355
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:17,950
Oh, so give me a sec.

356
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:21,470
If I need a- I need a- Get more water.

357
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:22,130
Give me a sec.

358
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:24,010
I dehydrate so much because I'm sick.

359
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,300
Water outside.

360
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,140
I bought like a case of water.

361
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:40,200
I had to uber eat some more water because I don't- I need to like uber eat- Like not uber eat.

362
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:43,460
Um, when I'm better, I need to get a fucking What is it called?

363
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:44,280
A kettle?

364
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:47,020
I need to buy a kettle for hot water.

365
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:50,120
Mary always said the mask stays on, doggy.

366
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,780
And he matched her, freak!

367
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,100
That's crazy.

368
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:04,120
Yeah, they uber eats water from like a um, a store for me because like I can't go outside to buy water.

369
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,560
Uh, Zane, thank you for the super chat.

370
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,540
Thank you, thank you.

371
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:07,860
Okay.

372
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:11,600
Um, oh yeah, you want to be a little bit louder.

373
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,160
Let's see.

374
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:16,680
I love- I love the first boss of this game, which is always settings.

375
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:18,260
Alright.

376
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:24,220
Okay, I don't rem- Like I said, I don't remember much from this game.

377
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:29,400
Um, I like watch lore videos of it, but like where do I go?

378
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,780
I guess I'd go to the bathroom?

379
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:34,780
No?

380
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:35,640
Can I not?

381
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:36,620
Ooh.

382
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:38,980
That's a pretty dark bathroom already.

383
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:40,660
Whoa.

384
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,020
Hey, that's me.

385
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,900
Oh my- That's scary.

386
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,140
That's fucking scary.

387
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,700
Holy shit.

388
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:54,580
That's- That's fucking- That's fucking scary right there.

389
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,720
Holy shit.

390
00:23:58,780 --> 00:23:59,440
Oh my god.

391
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,260
You can't even see those fucking face.

392
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,460
You're just like, who the fuck are these giant ass dogs?

393
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:07,760
Alright.

394
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,100
Oh, I can't go to the ladies room?

395
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:10,960
There's no one here.

396
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,800
I'm not like a pervert or anything.

397
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,320
I just want to know if there's loot.

398
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:17,100
I just- That's awful.

399
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:19,340
Okay.

400
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,120
Welcome.

401
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,540
Is that Silent Hill?

402
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:24,260
Right there?

403
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,400
I don't remember where- Okay.

404
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:29,020
That's- No.

405
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,000
That's just a lake.

406
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,380
Oh, there's loot in my car?

407
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,280
Okay.

408
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:35,280
Let's get loot in my car.

409
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:37,520
Okay.

410
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:40,380
He is a pervert, but I'm not a perv- Oh shit.

411
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:40,900
Okay.

412
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:41,920
Oh shit.

413
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:42,120
Okay.

414
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:43,360
That's what I actually needed.

415
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:44,220
Alright.

416
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:44,700
The map.

417
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:45,860
Okay.

418
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:50,420
We could either go to the long way or the short way.

419
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:51,780
Alright, guys.

420
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:53,480
Alright.

421
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:58,940
Let's go- Clearly, since this is a horror game, we go via the graveyard.

422
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:05,240
In honor of Spooktober, we go to the graveyard, right?

423
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:08,800
Unless there is- Unless there's something here.

424
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:09,560
Hello?

425
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,440
I'll set up the volume a little more sound guy.

426
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,760
Is there anything here?

427
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:18,640
Okay.

428
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,580
The road is closed.

429
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:24,160
I mean, there's another car here, so like I'm not the only person here.

430
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:25,840
See?

431
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:29,180
There's a car here and there's clearly food in the car.

432
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:34,020
So like, I'm not the only person here that's like, traveling around.

433
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:38,560
Why is there a giant dog head?

434
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:44,720
Look, I- Look, Mary in her dying words was like, please never take the mask off.

435
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:47,540
I wanna be the only wife you have.

436
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:55,460
The only woman you can have after me has to match my freak.

437
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:05,160
She has to match my exact freakiness so you can never take the mask off after I die.

438
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:10,780
So like, now he wears the mask on cause that's the only lady he can date afterwards.

439
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,880
It was in her will.

440
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:22,880
Yeah, she's like, you can never take- The only person you can marry or like date right after my death is the only person that can match my fucking freak.

441
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:26,360
Alright, nice.

442
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:28,900
Nice and immersion.

443
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:32,240
God, I have to look at the asshole the entire time.

444
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,260
I think that's the worst part.

445
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:36,260
I know there's nothing here cause I have no radio.

446
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,480
Um, that's another thing I remember from Silent Hill.

447
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:47,360
Like, I know there's nothing that could possibly kill me cause I don't have the radio yet that's screeching in my fucking ear to be like, MONSTER!

448
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:47,900
MONSTER!

449
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,580
So like, I'm not too worried right now.

450
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:53,800
Wait, how do I pick this up?

451
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:55,280
E.

452
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,280
Oh shit.

453
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,780
That's how I save?

454
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:00,080
Okay.

455
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:05,540
Okay.

456
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:07,180
Mark, thank you for the super chat!

457
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:07,520
Thank you!

458
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:09,740
Alright.

459
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,120
Yes, we're picking stuff up.

460
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,020
It's been a while, guys.

461
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:19,400
Alright.

462
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,260
Open the cemetery.

463
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,480
Hello, cemetery.

464
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:23,780
Hello!

465
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,040
It's an abandoned cemetery!

466
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:29,260
Legally, I can grave rob this if we learn anything.

467
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,960
Oh, there's that lady!

468
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,020
Hello, lady.

469
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:38,680
No, James.

470
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,020
The mask stays on.

471
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,320
Cosmic, thank you for the super chat.

472
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:43,020
Thank you, thank you.

473
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:43,900
Oh, sorry.

474
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:46,260
I know, it's the mask isn't it?

475
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:54,880
Oh, let me bring it up a little more too.

476
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:55,540
Alright.

477
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:56,480
Let me know if it's better.

478
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:06,220
Valid reaction!

479
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,280
Okay,

480
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:26,600
bring it up.

481
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:27,260
Sorry, lady.

482
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,780
You have weird game balancing issues right now.

483
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:36,520
Me?

484
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:36,720
Me?

485
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:42,220
Your kind's not welcome in Silent Hill.

486
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,100
What, a furry?

487
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:48,420
Sorry,

488
00:28:59,090 --> 00:28:59,990
I know this is...

489
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:05,490
I know, like, not only is the mask ruining your immersion, but me trying to raise the volume of this game.

490
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:10,270
Ooh.

491
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:14,680
Me too.

492
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,840
I'm looking for my mama.

493
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:19,340
I mean, my mother.

494
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:20,620
My mama?

495
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:21,840
It's been so long since I've seen her.

496
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:24,060
You have fucking mommy issues, lady?

497
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,460
I thought... What about daddy issues?

498
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:29,940
My father... Oh no, her dad's still alive, so...

499
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:31,320
But I can't find them either.

500
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:38,090
I'm sorry, it's not your problem.

501
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:39,890
No, I... No, it's fine.

502
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:41,790
I hope you find them.

503
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,840
Just like how I'm gonna find my dead wife.

504
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:47,500
She's still alive, you know?

505
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:52,020
Like, I know everybody said they're was a body and everything, but like, how would there be a letter?

506
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:52,480
Hmm?

507
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:55,080
It's like those telemarketer scams.

508
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,900
They're like, trying to be the...

509
00:29:56,900 --> 00:30:00,980
They're like, I'm your dead grandma, please send me $500,000.

510
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,580
And you're like, see guys?

511
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,840
I told you!

512
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,820
She's... He's alive!

513
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:06,080
She's alive!

514
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:08,200
Guys, I told you!

515
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:09,760
Why else would I get a phone call?

516
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,580
Did you, uh...

517
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:16,020
Did you want anything else?

518
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:18,900
No, it's just...

519
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:22,230
She's not...

520
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:22,990
She's dead, everybody!

521
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:26,070
This is why I went alone, because my therapist will think I'm crazy.

522
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:30,270
It's like, you just need to start taking off your mask.

523
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:31,870
It's been like, five years.

524
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:34,770
And I'm like, I will take off my mask when I fucking die.

525
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:41,050
Oh my god.

526
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:42,430
Oh, Jesus Christ.

527
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:44,230
Silent Hill, why are you so silent?

528
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:51,260
Okay.

529
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:52,900
Let's see.

530
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:54,500
I'm gonna check the audio for this.

531
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:58,100
Okay, yeah, the voiceover is like, fucking all the way up.

532
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,260
Who would've thought Silent Hill is really silent, guys?

533
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:02,420
Who would've fucking thought?

534
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,520
Is there any, like, loot here for me?

535
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,660
The hills are silent, be careful.

536
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Can't grave rob that, you're right, James.

537
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:14,560
Fucking sucks.

538
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:20,480
I know, I know.

539
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,920
I could feel your I could feel your pain.

540
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:28,180
Alright.

541
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:31,180
There's no radio yet, so I know I'm okay.

542
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,260
I know I'll be okay.

543
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:39,480
The moment I find the radio is when I know I'm fucked.

544
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,220
That's okay, there's no radio yet.

545
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,380
There's no radio yet.

546
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,320
What can hurt me?

547
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:45,920
Nothing!

548
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:49,220
What the fuck?

549
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:49,600
What the fuck?

550
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:51,580
You are not supposed to come out yet.

551
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:52,560
There's no radio yet.

552
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:58,220
You're not able to hurt me yet!

553
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:00,760
There's no siren or radio yet!

554
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:03,160
There's no siren or radio yet!

555
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:04,840
Oh, Silent Hill Ranch.

556
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:06,200
Oh, Silent Hill Ranch.

557
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:06,940
Oh, fine.

558
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:08,720
Exactly.

559
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:12,620
If anything bad happens, I have the dog in me.

560
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:14,460
Oh.

561
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:14,640
Oh.

562
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:16,180
Oh.

563
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:18,460
I don't like this.

564
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:20,740
Oh.

565
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,900
I know nothing can show up now, but I don't like the ambience.

566
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,160
Monster incoming.

567
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,240
Don't say that!

568
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:31,000
There's no soundtrack yet!

569
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:34,740
This is just to build up tension!

570
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:35,460
This is just to build up tension!

571
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,140
Nothing can hurt me yet!

572
00:32:40,930 --> 00:32:42,510
Yeah, I can't go here yet.

573
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:45,810
Yeah, I can't go here yet.

574
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:47,370
I got it.

575
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:48,870
I don't feel so good, guys.

576
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:51,470
I don't feel good right now.

577
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:52,990
I don't like this.

578
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:55,130
Oh, my god.

579
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,930
God, I don't like the BGM.

580
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:01,790
I don't know if you guys hear the BGM.

581
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:03,410
It's like...

582
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:07,230
I'm like, stop!

583
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:08,130
Stop!

584
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:12,990
It's just like being like, come on, you're almost there.

585
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:14,790
You're almost there!

586
00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:17,370
You're almost there, Doki!

587
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:17,810
Come on!

588
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:19,430
We can't keep playing that one instrument!

589
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:24,150
Okay, here we go.

590
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:26,990
Oh, I don't like it.

591
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:27,990
I know it's like...

592
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:32,650
supposed to raise up tension and everything, but god, it fucking sucks.

593
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:34,310
Do we go through that door?

594
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:35,830
Or...

595
00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:38,930
Does it need a key?

596
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:40,470
Oh, it does.

597
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:41,190
Okay, I...

598
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:43,750
I don't know...

599
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:49,590
I don't know if you said up more and already did up more, or like, you need me to put it up more right now.

600
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:51,170
Oh, my god.

601
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:52,290
Dude, fuck me.

602
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:54,470
Why am I playing this game?

603
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:55,870
God damn it.

604
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:58,110
I did promise I would play this game eventually.

605
00:33:58,690 --> 00:34:01,190
Went down to get the window fixed.

606
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:02,870
Spare key in the drawer.

607
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:03,490
Okay.

608
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:06,350
Oh, my god.

609
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:07,730
I feel really scared right now.

610
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:08,910
I don't like it.

611
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:13,340
Okay.

612
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:16,380
Anyone in here?

613
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:16,940
Hello?

614
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:20,240
Did I break into your fucking house?

615
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:28,460
Okay, yeah, I have to.

616
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,120
No name.

617
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:30,780
Don't say that.

618
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:32,300
Thank you for the super chat.

619
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:32,740
Thank you.

620
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:34,100
Okay.

621
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,240
Alright.

622
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:39,080
Oh, my god.

623
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:39,680
Sir.

624
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:44,040
Like, I know I'm breaking into your house, but sir, why is your...

625
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,540
Sir, you need to clean up, bro.

626
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:48,560
Oh, god.

627
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:49,880
The soundtrack is too good.

628
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,920
I hate the soundtrack so much.

629
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:55,460
It's too good, so I hate it.

630
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,200
Okay, auto service and tires.

631
00:34:59,460 --> 00:34:59,980
Okay.

632
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:04,980
Is there anything else that he owns that I can take from him?

633
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,700
God, when they do too good of a good job.

634
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:14,530
Okay.

635
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:16,530
Hello.

636
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:18,410
There was nothing else there.

637
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:20,410
Guess you did not see anything.

638
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:22,710
Guys, there's no radio siren yet, guys.

639
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:23,410
No, you don't.

640
00:35:23,410 --> 00:35:24,270
You don't hear anything.

641
00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:25,430
I know.

642
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:26,410
Don't fuck with me.

643
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:28,950
I stole one thing.

644
00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:30,350
Wait, there's a gun?

645
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:33,070
There's a gun?

646
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:35,310
Okay.

647
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:37,590
Swear to god.

648
00:35:37,810 --> 00:35:38,690
Are you sure?

649
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:42,770
Okay, not here.

650
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:43,170
Okay.

651
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:43,990
Alright.

652
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:48,290
The gun, did you see it?

653
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:50,830
That's a lie.

654
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:53,350
Don't fuck up.

655
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:57,510
I have never played this game before, so I don't believe anything.

656
00:36:01,010 --> 00:36:02,690
It's right there, Toki.

657
00:36:03,090 --> 00:36:06,490
I've never played this game before, so you know I don't believe anything.

658
00:36:11,890 --> 00:36:14,210
Thank you for the super chat.

659
00:36:14,330 --> 00:36:14,770
Thank you.

660
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:16,510
Okay.

661
00:36:18,290 --> 00:36:18,810
Alright.

662
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:21,730
You guys know I'll believe it.

663
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:25,250
Oh god.

664
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:26,910
I'm just a regular guy.

665
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:29,510
I don't think I've even operated a gun before.

666
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:31,190
Oh, I don't like this.

667
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:32,910
There's gonna be dogs, too.

668
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:38,550
There's gonna be doggos, and then there's gonna be nurse, hot nurses.

669
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:41,590
And then there's gonna be hot pyramid heads.

670
00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:43,570
And then like...

671
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:47,950
Do they keep the scene with the pyramid head and the nurse?

672
00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:51,250
Oh my god.

673
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:54,630
Because that shows how fucking fucked up James is.

674
00:36:56,390 --> 00:36:56,830
Okay.

675
00:36:58,790 --> 00:37:00,250
Blackfire, thank you for the file.

676
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:01,270
Thank you.

677
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:06,110
Burrito, thank you for the super chat.

678
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:06,370
Thank you.

679
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:08,630
My greatest fear is humans with dog masses.

680
00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:16,370
I saw one walk by, which means I'm the main character in this Silent Hill game.

681
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:18,050
Thank you for the super chat.

682
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:18,530
Thank you.

683
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:20,490
Oh.

684
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:23,830
Oh no.

685
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:24,930
There's the fog.

686
00:37:25,970 --> 00:37:27,190
There's the fog.

687
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:30,730
James, why can't you pick another day to come to Silent Hill?

688
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:33,990
Like, just look at the weather forecast, James.

689
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:35,270
Like, I don't understand.

690
00:37:36,290 --> 00:37:37,690
Oh my god.

691
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:38,610
I don't understand.

692
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:41,150
You could literally pick any other day.

693
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:44,910
You could be like, what is the weather forecast in Silent Hill?

694
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:48,970
Like, why did you have to fucking...

695
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:50,850
No, he can't bring a homie.

696
00:37:51,850 --> 00:37:54,050
They don't match his freak right now.

697
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:55,590
He doesn't like...

698
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:59,270
He's so... I don't think his homies are even associating with him.

699
00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:01,510
He's never taking his mask off since she died.

700
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:02,910
Since Mary died.

701
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:06,930
Nothing can stop it.

702
00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:09,390
Like, you could have waited one more day.

703
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:10,210
She's like...

704
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:12,750
Technically, you know she's like dead dead.

705
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:14,910
So like, what's one more day?

706
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:18,030
It's not like she'll suddenly die right after sending that letter.

707
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:22,710
Okay.

708
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:30,350
But Larius, thank you for the super chat.

709
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:30,750
Thank you.

710
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:31,130
Thank you.

711
00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:31,170
Wait.

712
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:33,670
Like, why is there a dead end right here?

713
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:36,570
Like, was there supposed to be anything here?

714
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:37,850
Thank you for the super chat.

715
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:38,150
Thank you.

716
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:45,090
The nurses are extra creepy because it means James was thinking those thoughts about every damn woman in his life.

717
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:46,650
I told you.

718
00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:49,990
But he can't do anything about it because he promised Mary.

719
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:53,430
That's why he's never taking it off.

720
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:55,150
Okay.

721
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:56,230
Where am I?

722
00:38:56,530 --> 00:38:58,130
Do we go here?

723
00:38:58,530 --> 00:38:59,390
Or here?

724
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:01,930
I hate that they give me choices.

725
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:03,570
I don't want free will.

726
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:08,210
Can I imagine you yell me a chat into the time mask?

727
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:11,370
It's that thing.

728
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:11,830
Oh, okay.

729
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:12,970
Don't do anything here.

730
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:14,550
I can't open doors.

731
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:17,550
Why is the hill so silent?

732
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:21,690
No trespassers.

733
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:23,950
Visitors must register at the main office.

734
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:25,310
What?

735
00:39:25,370 --> 00:39:27,990
How fucking secluded is Silent Hill?

736
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:29,830
What do you mean no visitor?

737
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:31,650
A small town would love tourists.

738
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:35,610
Wouldn't you think a small town would actually want more tourism?

739
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:37,930
Or like extra income?

740
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:39,830
That's when you know.

741
00:39:40,090 --> 00:39:41,910
That's when you know it's fucking weird.

742
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:44,110
Oh my god.

743
00:39:44,310 --> 00:39:46,790
Why is the hill so silent?

744
00:39:47,810 --> 00:39:48,690
Guys, stop!

745
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:55,190
It's here!

746
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:57,090
Oh my god, did you see?

747
00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:00,750
Did you see?

748
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:06,630
Okay, I have the other map.

749
00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:07,430
Oh shit.

750
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:07,830
Okay.

751
00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:08,990
That's a lot of places.

752
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:10,130
Okay.

753
00:40:14,290 --> 00:40:15,370
Okay, here we go.

754
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:15,910
Oh my god.

755
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:17,290
This is the entire area.

756
00:40:17,870 --> 00:40:18,350
Alright.

757
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:20,650
This is where I have to go now.

758
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:21,650
Oh my god.

759
00:40:23,570 --> 00:40:24,530
Oh fuck.

760
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:25,290
Okay, now.

761
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:26,590
This is the worst part.

762
00:40:27,210 --> 00:40:28,710
Do enemies respawn?

763
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:30,990
Before I go straight into the hill.

764
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:32,650
Do...

765
00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:36,070
Do the enemies respawn?

766
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:36,950
I need to know .

767
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:40,530
I need...

768
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:43,370
Okay, they can't Alright, now I know.

769
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:44,990
I cannot waste my bullets.

770
00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:46,170
Okay.

771
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,520
Okay, now I know.

772
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,740
Guys, I need a...

773
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:58,040
This is crucial information.

774
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:01,800
Guys, this is actual crucial information.

775
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:07,120
This Silent Hill is all about making sure you have enough materials.

776
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:08,240
I need a no.

777
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:10,480
Do they respawn?

778
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:13,000
Guys, please.

779
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,140
Please, this is so important.

780
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,600
This is...

781
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,800
Oh my god.

782
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:20,060
This is so important.

783
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,920
I need a no if they respawn.

784
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:23,940
Okay.

785
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:26,080
It's early access.

786
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:30,420
It doesn't mean this game didn't come out 20 plus years ago, chat.

787
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:31,540
This...

788
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,740
It's a remake, not a fucking...

789
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:36,080
Not a new IP.

790
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:37,700
Miss Cassandra.

791
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:42,260
A customer came in today ordering mixed bouquet, red and white.

792
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:43,760
I tried to explain his bad luck.

793
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:45,460
He just won.

794
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:46,600
He seemed a bit off.

795
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:48,760
Looked at me like I wasn't even there.

796
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,000
Then he just left.

797
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,880
Said he'd be back to pick him up later.

798
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:54,600
I just want to let you know since...

799
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,880
Oh my god, my fucking cursor is a fucking knife.

800
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:59,200
Since I must be gone by then.

801
00:41:59,360 --> 00:41:59,700
Okay.

802
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:01,760
Alright, cool.

803
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:06,770
Okay, they respawn.

804
00:42:06,930 --> 00:42:08,150
Okay, that is good to know.

805
00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:13,170
So now, now I know I can... I could just run.

806
00:42:13,850 --> 00:42:16,810
Cause like, if they didn't respawn, I'd just kill everything.

807
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:19,190
And then fucking pray to god I'll...

808
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:19,970
Oh, that's blood.

809
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:22,170
What is... I don't know.

810
00:42:22,210 --> 00:42:23,330
James, fucking touch it.

811
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:24,390
And then you'll realize it's blood.

812
00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:25,910
I fucking know it.

813
00:42:25,970 --> 00:42:26,850
I look down.

814
00:42:27,050 --> 00:42:28,690
I'm not even in this world with you.

815
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:29,690
And I know it's blood.

816
00:42:32,370 --> 00:42:32,810
Okay.

817
00:42:34,770 --> 00:42:36,330
James, Jesus fucking Christ.

818
00:42:36,410 --> 00:42:37,590
Of course it's fucking blood.

819
00:42:37,810 --> 00:42:38,190
Like...

820
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:41,550
Like I'm not even in this world with you right now.

821
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:43,930
Like I'm not even in this game world.

822
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,360
It's just red dirt.

823
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,220
Oh god, okay.

824
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:56,900
Alright, here we go.

825
00:42:58,220 --> 00:42:59,440
Here we fucking go.

826
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:02,720
Like, do I get any...

827
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,020
Give me a fucking weapon!

828
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,660
Oh my god, I hate this.

829
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:09,620
Oh, there's more blood.

830
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:11,200
Here it is.

831
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:12,540
More of that.

832
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:12,720
Yeah!

833
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:13,400
That stuff!

834
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:14,480
Touch it, James!

835
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:16,500
Then you'll know exactly what it is!

836
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:20,340
Sorry, he doesn't want to get his mask dirty, which is understandable.

837
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:22,260
Where the fuck do I go?

838
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:25,600
They gave me free will and I hate that!

839
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:30,620
Follow the...

840
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:32,980
Why the fuck would I follow the blood?

841
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:34,700
Blood stops!

842
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:38,200
I guess it goes this way?

843
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:42,540
Who in their right mind would follow the fucking blood?

844
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:45,460
You would like run away from the blood.

845
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:50,900
Oh...

846
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:51,740
Oh...

847
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:54,900
Oh, there's another trail of blood!

848
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:58,100
There it is!

849
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:00,180
Okay...

850
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:09,180
I mean, he literally ran off here without telling anybody that he's in Silent Hill because his dead wife sent him a letter.

851
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:11,300
And, um...

852
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:15,000
And even though you know, he could have told his therapist too.

853
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:17,040
Like, I'm pretty sure he's in therapy.

854
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,560
There's no way he's not.

855
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:20,300
Oh, there he is.

856
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:23,380
Oh, that's... I remember this scene.

857
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:24,860
That's an infamous scene.

858
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:27,000
Right there.

859
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:28,440
Yeah!

860
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,360
Fucking James, what is that?

861
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:33,240
Holy shit, what kind of freak is that?

862
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:34,420
Hey, wait!

863
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:38,460
Oh yeah, bro, that's someone you clearly wanna follow.

864
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:40,260
Hey, wait up!

865
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:42,300
Hey, contortion man!

866
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:44,840
You're clearly in trouble!

867
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:46,100
You could...

868
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:53,400
Like, even if I don't know anything about the Silent Hill monsters, I would say he was a mental asylum patient that escaped!

869
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:54,580
You know?

870
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:56,580
It looked like he was in a straitjacket!

871
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:00,200
That's a good idea, you fucking idiot!

872
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,600
Okay, let's keep going.

873
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:11,320
Yeah, let's follow the crazy person that's fucking contorting.

874
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:18,080
Bro didn't want anyone to out-freak his freak.

875
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:21,920
London Simulator 2024.

876
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:24,680
Yavi, thank you for the super chat.

877
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:25,940
Thank you, thank you.

878
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:28,280
Oh my god.

879
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:30,520
Here we go.

880
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:32,260
Up we go.

881
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:37,260
Here we go!

882
00:45:41,570 --> 00:45:43,590
Error closed off due to an accident.

883
00:45:43,870 --> 00:45:45,970
Trespassers might lead to injury or death.

884
00:45:46,850 --> 00:45:47,410
Alright.

885
00:45:47,570 --> 00:45:48,830
Guess we don't go that way.

886
00:45:49,930 --> 00:45:51,230
Wait, what way do we go?

887
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:55,330
I saw him fucking contorting, but...

888
00:45:55,870 --> 00:45:56,370
What?

889
00:45:57,770 --> 00:45:59,430
Did I just go the other way?

890
00:46:00,530 --> 00:46:03,610
Did he just disappear and then I just have to live with it?

891
00:46:03,890 --> 00:46:05,490
Oh no, it's the alleyway.

892
00:46:05,650 --> 00:46:06,450
Okay, nevermind.

893
00:46:07,530 --> 00:46:09,870
Nevermind, let's go to the dark, dingy alleyway.

894
00:46:09,970 --> 00:46:10,870
You go, James.

895
00:46:11,150 --> 00:46:12,090
You fucking go.

896
00:46:15,530 --> 00:46:18,210
Go fucking enable his trauma.

897
00:46:18,370 --> 00:46:19,090
Let's go.

898
00:46:19,930 --> 00:46:21,470
Let's not seek help at all.

899
00:46:23,310 --> 00:46:23,870
Alright.

900
00:46:24,890 --> 00:46:28,210
This is like never, don't do what James does the game.

901
00:46:28,630 --> 00:46:30,790
If your wife is dead, seek help.

902
00:46:34,670 --> 00:46:35,930
Don't be like him.

903
00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:43,370
It kinda sucks that James is my name and every time Doki insults James, it feels like she's insulting me.

904
00:46:43,570 --> 00:46:44,990
It should have been me!

905
00:46:45,590 --> 00:46:47,230
Thank you for the super chat, James.

906
00:46:47,230 --> 00:46:48,330
Thank you, thank you.

907
00:46:50,510 --> 00:46:53,070
Yeah, this is what happens when you avoid therapy, guys.

908
00:46:54,930 --> 00:46:56,710
God, you can't even jump.

909
00:46:57,750 --> 00:46:59,190
Like, what good are you?

910
00:46:59,250 --> 00:46:59,790
Let's go through.

911
00:47:00,010 --> 00:47:01,010
Oh shit!

912
00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:02,110
What the fuck?

913
00:47:02,370 --> 00:47:03,810
Bro, he just slinked away.

914
00:47:05,130 --> 00:47:06,350
Yeah, let's follow it!

915
00:47:06,430 --> 00:47:06,750
Let's go!

916
00:47:07,090 --> 00:47:08,350
What would my therapist do?

917
00:47:08,490 --> 00:47:09,010
Not that!

918
00:47:09,190 --> 00:47:10,930
What would my therapist tell me to do?

919
00:47:10,990 --> 00:47:11,690
Don't do that?

920
00:47:11,950 --> 00:47:12,330
Ha!

921
00:47:12,890 --> 00:47:15,870
If I listened to my therapist, I wouldn't even be here.

922
00:47:21,930 --> 00:47:25,090
Nothing you've done so far was in the Silent Hill 2 game.

923
00:47:25,350 --> 00:47:27,410
And the Dufflers say they changed the combat system.

924
00:47:27,670 --> 00:47:28,930
You're literally in... No.

925
00:47:29,470 --> 00:47:30,470
No, Cory.

926
00:47:30,610 --> 00:47:30,950
No.

927
00:47:31,650 --> 00:47:33,630
You're literally in uncharted area.

928
00:47:33,910 --> 00:47:35,130
Thank you for the super chat.

929
00:47:35,270 --> 00:47:36,350
Thank you, thank you.

930
00:47:36,470 --> 00:47:41,010
Doki is a friend that yells at the people in the horror film the entire time.

931
00:47:41,410 --> 00:47:43,330
Thank you for the super chat.

932
00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:44,690
Thank you, ninja.

933
00:47:45,790 --> 00:47:46,310
Alright.

934
00:47:46,590 --> 00:47:46,990
Let's see.

935
00:47:47,050 --> 00:47:49,190
I'm the person that won't die in a horror game.

936
00:47:49,370 --> 00:47:52,070
Because the moment I see something fucky, I'm like, I'm out.

937
00:47:53,910 --> 00:47:55,110
I'm just like...

938
00:47:55,110 --> 00:47:56,410
I'm fucking leaving.

939
00:47:57,890 --> 00:47:59,150
Okay, I don't know if this is...

940
00:47:59,150 --> 00:47:59,870
I think this is 90.

941
00:48:00,190 --> 00:48:03,110
And then we'll boost it up just a little bit more.

942
00:48:03,410 --> 00:48:04,270
Alright, here we go.

943
00:48:06,210 --> 00:48:06,610
Alright.

944
00:48:08,070 --> 00:48:08,470
Uh...

945
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:13,300
Okay, here we go.

946
00:48:14,660 --> 00:48:16,120
CZ, thank you for the super chat.

947
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:16,980
Thank you, thank you.

948
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:24,460
First time super chatting for anyone on YouTube, but I had to let you know, I've been following since you modded Fillion and modded Opi, and I love your laugh so much.

949
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:25,000
Thank you!

950
00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:25,860
Thank you for the super chat.

951
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:26,820
Thank you, thank you.

952
00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:28,580
I really appreciate it.

953
00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:29,900
I'm glad you've been enjoying my content.

954
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:33,120
Look around to find an object marked by a white cloth.

955
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:36,340
Those are objects or traversals you can interact with.

956
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:37,820
And why not yellow paint?

957
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:38,640
I'm stupid.

958
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:40,600
Can't believe it.

959
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:43,100
This is why this game didn't get perfect 10 out of 10.

960
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:44,780
There was no yellow paint.

961
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:46,120
Hahahaha.

962
00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:48,540
Hahahaha.

963
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:50,180
White cloth?

964
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:52,980
Fucking amateur move bloom.

965
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:56,020
Amateur blooper.

966
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:56,840
Hahaha.

967
00:48:58,140 --> 00:48:59,140
Oh shit.

968
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:00,740
Oh, guess I can't go back.

969
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:02,640
Ugh, I hate this.

970
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:04,600
I actually hate this so much.

971
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:08,160
There's no way they're gonna make me fight this person without a fucking weapon.

972
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:11,120
There's no fucking way.

973
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:13,020
At best, it's just gonna scare me.

974
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:14,160
Ugh.

975
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:15,900
Okay.

976
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:18,240
What does this say?

977
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:19,560
Oh, it says zone.

978
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:19,960
Okay.

979
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:25,540
This damn mess takes up like 30% of the stream.

980
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:27,740
Good luck if anything comes at you.

981
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:30,660
You're at 11 o'clock.

982
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:32,000
Thank you.

983
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:32,840
Thank you for this.

984
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:37,880
Yeah, it would be fucking awkward if the enemy was right in front of that blind spot.

985
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:40,380
That one blind spot right there.

986
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:41,440
Hahaha.

987
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:43,780
That would be so awkward.

988
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:49,460
Literally the only blind spot that like I need to be able to see right there.

989
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:51,600
That would be so awkward.

990
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:54,420
Alright.

991
00:49:56,020 --> 00:49:59,040
The moment it gives me a weapon, I know it's fucking over.

992
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:00,380
Okay, nutrition.

993
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:03,540
Alright, I got health drinks.

994
00:50:03,740 --> 00:50:04,920
Press V to drink.

995
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:06,640
Okay, I know like I is my inventory.

996
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:08,240
Oh, I have memo.

997
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:11,220
Oh, it's just the... what's my personal?

998
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:12,560
Oh, that's Mary's letter.

999
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:13,600
That's her!

1000
00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:15,760
From when she was still healthy.

1001
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:23,220
As a fellow I can confirm we're a bit freaky with poor decision making.

1002
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:28,400
Thank you for the super chat.

1003
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:28,760
Thank you.

1004
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:29,300
Thank you.

1005
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:34,000
Oh, I don't like that.

1006
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:36,560
Okay.

1007
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:38,600
Oh, I don't like that.

1008
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:41,500
Oh my God, please.

1009
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:50,180
Oh, this is not going so well.

1010
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:52,860
I actually heard it.

1011
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:55,340
Oh, the static.

1012
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:56,320
Here it comes.

1013
00:50:57,180 --> 00:50:58,860
I hear the static.

1014
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:01,020
No more...

1015
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:08,680
What if I just never pick that up?

1016
00:51:09,380 --> 00:51:10,020
Okay.

1017
00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:11,960
Do I have to?

1018
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:15,000
Can I just go through the game without picking it up?

1019
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:17,680
Oh, here we go!

1020
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:24,300
James is just staring at us like, do I take it?

1021
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:29,020
It's time.

1022
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:31,760
Oh, no.

1023
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:34,280
There it is!

1024
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:36,620
And so it begins.

1025
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:39,040
Love the content, Toki.

1026
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:40,940
Thank you for the super chat.

1027
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:41,640
Thank you.

1028
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:42,360
Thank you.

1029
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:43,080
Chemical.

1030
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:44,200
Oh my God.

1031
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:45,160
Can I just not?

1032
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:47,980
There we go!

1033
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:51,260
The game starts now!

1034
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:51,960
Oh,

1035
00:51:56,220 --> 00:51:57,560
there he is too!

1036
00:51:57,860 --> 00:51:59,600
Oh, he's about to vibrate!

1037
00:52:03,730 --> 00:52:04,250
Hello.

1038
00:52:05,270 --> 00:52:06,190
Oh, shit.

1039
00:52:06,450 --> 00:52:07,590
There he is.

1040
00:52:07,690 --> 00:52:08,490
Contortion man.

1041
00:52:09,910 --> 00:52:10,710
Oh, shit.

1042
00:52:10,770 --> 00:52:11,650
You're freaky too?

1043
00:52:11,930 --> 00:52:12,430
Damn.

1044
00:52:12,590 --> 00:52:13,930
Is this like a bondage thing?

1045
00:52:14,770 --> 00:52:17,410
Yo, me and my dead wife used to have a thing too.

1046
00:52:19,390 --> 00:52:20,210
Oh, okay.

1047
00:52:20,790 --> 00:52:23,590
Yeah, grab that fucking nail in the plane.

1048
00:52:23,790 --> 00:52:24,330
Jesus.

1049
00:52:24,490 --> 00:52:25,870
I'm not gonna ask any questions.

1050
00:52:26,930 --> 00:52:27,470
Alright.

1051
00:52:29,950 --> 00:52:30,770
Get out.

1052
00:52:31,310 --> 00:52:32,150
Get out.

1053
00:52:32,450 --> 00:52:33,710
Oh, fuck!

1054
00:52:33,770 --> 00:52:34,350
I'm sorry!

1055
00:52:34,970 --> 00:52:38,330
How the fuck was I supposed to know he was gonna do that?

1056
00:52:38,790 --> 00:52:39,750
Get down!

1057
00:52:39,790 --> 00:52:40,290
Get down!

1058
00:52:40,590 --> 00:52:41,430
Get down!

1059
00:52:41,930 --> 00:52:42,610
Get down!

1060
00:52:43,550 --> 00:52:44,550
Fucking die!

1061
00:52:46,230 --> 00:52:46,970
That's right!

1062
00:52:47,710 --> 00:52:48,690
Oh my God.

1063
00:52:48,970 --> 00:52:51,410
This is what was missing in my life too, I guess.

1064
00:52:51,630 --> 00:52:52,670
I gotta make sure.

1065
00:52:53,390 --> 00:52:53,830
Bro.

1066
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:56,670
Gotta make sure he's dead dead.

1067
00:52:56,930 --> 00:52:57,990
Okay, he's definitely dead.

1068
00:52:58,730 --> 00:52:59,170
Okay.

1069
00:52:59,410 --> 00:53:01,130
Is that what I saw?

1070
00:53:01,190 --> 00:53:02,570
I don't fu- James, yes it is!

1071
00:53:02,750 --> 00:53:03,350
How the fuck?

1072
00:53:03,510 --> 00:53:03,950
Yes!

1073
00:53:04,510 --> 00:53:07,450
What do you mean your question- I think you got it.

1074
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:08,510
Are you guys sure?

1075
00:53:09,050 --> 00:53:09,610
Can't be sure.

1076
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:12,950
Are you guys sure?

1077
00:53:13,390 --> 00:53:15,250
Are you guys sure?

1078
00:53:15,410 --> 00:53:15,910
I need it.

1079
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:17,210
Come on!

1080
00:53:17,290 --> 00:53:18,030
I don't know!

1081
00:53:18,110 --> 00:53:20,290
I don't know the anatomy of this fucker!

1082
00:53:20,670 --> 00:53:21,110
Like...

1083
00:53:23,550 --> 00:53:24,070
Extreme.

1084
00:53:24,470 --> 00:53:26,390
One more for the road.

1085
00:53:26,630 --> 00:53:27,970
The double tap.

1086
00:53:28,110 --> 00:53:29,570
The 20 tap.

1087
00:53:29,870 --> 00:53:31,530
I just- I don't know!

1088
00:53:33,170 --> 00:53:35,470
How was I supposed to know he was dead dead?

1089
00:53:36,430 --> 00:53:39,250
How do you go from woods to cereal?

1090
00:53:39,390 --> 00:53:40,970
Cause it was one guy!

1091
00:53:41,970 --> 00:53:42,490
Like...

1092
00:53:42,490 --> 00:53:43,870
It was one guy!

1093
00:53:43,950 --> 00:53:45,930
He literally had nothing on him.

1094
00:53:45,970 --> 00:53:47,450
All he had was his legs.

1095
00:53:48,730 --> 00:53:52,010
All he had in him was literally his legs.

1096
00:53:52,250 --> 00:53:52,970
Okay, gotta make sure.

1097
00:53:54,370 --> 00:53:57,830
It's when we get to the dogs when it gets scary.

1098
00:53:58,250 --> 00:53:59,350
Cause dogs can't run.

1099
00:53:59,850 --> 00:54:04,670
And when there's more than one of them maybe it's still alive!

1100
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:08,470
Maybe ten more love taps will do the trick.

1101
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:21,220
It's like when there's four of them where I have to freak out cause it's like it gets a little more difficult to fucking do anything.

1102
00:54:23,140 --> 00:54:23,560
Alright.

1103
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:32,980
That radio was in different location?

1104
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:34,080
Oh no.

1105
00:54:34,220 --> 00:54:35,400
Are you fucking serious?

1106
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:36,700
Oh yes!

1107
00:54:37,260 --> 00:54:41,300
The dirty fucking meat- fucking my mask!

1108
00:54:42,260 --> 00:54:44,540
My fucking mask!

1109
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:47,660
Guys, you can't even see the item!

1110
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:52,020
A giant ass head is blocking the item!

1111
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:56,100
Okay, we can sort of tell there's a dirty fucking syringe.

1112
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:57,640
Alright, nice.

1113
00:54:58,540 --> 00:54:58,980
Okay.

1114
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:00,040
Alright.

1115
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:01,300
It's fine.

1116
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:02,780
It's fine.

1117
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:05,740
Also, like, don't fucking random- James!

1118
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:06,520
Please!

1119
00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:10,220
Please, you're going through a downward spiral.

1120
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:19,600
James, please don't use don't use a random needle you found in the- James, please.

1121
00:55:20,260 --> 00:55:23,740
Please don't use this needle you found in the fucking floor.

1122
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:27,020
It's not- James.

1123
00:55:27,020 --> 00:55:28,320
Holy shit.

1124
00:55:36,740 --> 00:55:37,960
Come- What?

1125
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:40,740
Mary?

1126
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:42,740
I knew I wasn't crazy.

1127
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:45,200
I knew that what body wasn't yours.

1128
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:46,740
I knew it.

1129
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:52,440
I knew you got a body double and faked your death.

1130
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:53,500
They call me crazy.

1131
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,040
They call me crazy.

1132
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:00,880
You sound just like a therapist.

1133
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:01,460
James!

1134
00:56:04,420 --> 00:56:05,080
I'm crazy.

1135
00:56:05,140 --> 00:56:07,460
Why do I hear her voice right now?

1136
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:10,600
I don't need meds!

1137
00:56:10,820 --> 00:56:13,600
I don't need that I'm not hearing voices!

1138
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:15,440
Okay.

1139
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:17,720
Look at me now, therapist.

1140
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,940
How's that for well adjusted?

1141
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:22,980
Zane, thank you for the super chat.

1142
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:23,440
Thank you.

1143
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:23,940
Thank you.

1144
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:26,720
What voices?

1145
00:56:26,740 --> 00:56:28,100
They were all real.

1146
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:29,280
I fucking knew it.

1147
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:32,080
It validated my- It validated me.

1148
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:34,000
I knew it was real.

1149
00:56:35,580 --> 00:56:36,060
Okay.

1150
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:38,620
It's the meds.

1151
00:56:38,620 --> 00:56:39,260
I knew it.

1152
00:56:39,340 --> 00:56:42,040
I stopped taking the meds so I could hear her again.

1153
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:43,020
Where are you, Mary?

1154
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:45,520
Alright.

1155
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:47,740
I guess we go down this Martin Street.

1156
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:49,000
There's nowhere else to go.

1157
00:56:52,620 --> 00:56:54,640
When will we get to the sexy nurses?

1158
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:56,840
That's the better question.

1159
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:00,700
Did you see him, Toki?

1160
00:57:00,740 --> 00:57:01,680
We're not real.

1161
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:04,700
No, you're real because I didn't take my meds!

1162
00:57:05,980 --> 00:57:06,780
You're so real!

1163
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:08,500
Oh, that's a dead body.

1164
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:11,720
Yeah, that's a fucking dead body.

1165
00:57:18,350 --> 00:57:18,970
Newly's Bar.

1166
00:57:19,650 --> 00:57:20,890
Okay, do I go there?

1167
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:25,880
I guess I go there, right?

1168
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:27,440
Oh, there we go.

1169
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:29,260
Okay, I have to go to Newly's Bar.

1170
00:57:34,620 --> 00:57:35,020
Uh...

1171
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:37,040
Hermandus, thank you for the super chat.

1172
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:37,420
Thank you.

1173
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:38,020
Thank you.

1174
00:57:39,940 --> 00:57:40,720
What the fuck?

1175
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:40,860
What?

1176
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:43,600
The fuck was that?

1177
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:46,540
My radio didn't go crazy yet.

1178
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:49,240
If you're reading this, leave.

1179
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:50,780
This place is not what it seems.

1180
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:52,160
Sometimes you just have to look.

1181
00:57:58,610 --> 00:57:59,470
Run away.

1182
00:58:00,450 --> 00:58:01,670
Okay, I'm gonna use the bathroom.

1183
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:58,180
Only did I use the bathroom.

1184
00:58:58,360 --> 00:58:59,980
I also turned on the lights outside.

1185
00:59:00,220 --> 00:59:02,260
I turned on the lights in my hallway.

1186
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:03,280
Alright!

1187
00:59:06,140 --> 00:59:06,620
Okay.

1188
00:59:06,620 --> 00:59:07,520
Okay, that's...

1189
00:59:07,700 --> 00:59:08,900
Alright, that's reassuring.

1190
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:11,360
That's... That's reassuring.

1191
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:15,640
She did run away.

1192
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:17,120
Alright.

1193
00:59:18,380 --> 00:59:22,500
Off we go to see the wonderful Wizard of Oz.

1194
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:25,060
Whoa!

1195
00:59:25,140 --> 00:59:26,240
There he goes!

1196
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:28,340
Okay, that's a little...

1197
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:32,600
I can't take that seriously.

1198
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:36,760
The way he fucking just crawls like that.

1199
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:37,080
Like...

1200
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:38,240
What the fuck?

1201
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:41,640
There's a giant... That's a fucking rat!

1202
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:45,300
It's... What the fuck was... Okay.

1203
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:46,940
Did they always crawl like that?

1204
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:50,120
There's... There's no way!

1205
00:59:50,660 --> 00:59:53,620
There's no way they always crawled like that.

1206
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:55,040
What the fuck was that?

1207
00:59:55,540 --> 00:59:57,280
Are there items behind me?

1208
00:59:58,200 --> 00:59:59,280
Oh my god.

1209
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:03,540
There's no way that's how they move.

1210
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:05,040
There's no fucking...

1211
01:00:05,700 --> 01:00:06,100
What?

1212
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:07,160
What?

1213
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:09,100
What kind of dog was that?

1214
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:14,300
Cas, thank you for the super chat.

1215
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:16,660
I'm just making sure there's no items here.

1216
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:18,300
There's no way!

1217
01:00:18,780 --> 01:00:24,040
There's no way they used to crawl like that in the first game.

1218
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:27,240
Okay.

1219
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:28,880
Oh my god.

1220
01:00:28,940 --> 01:00:30,000
What a weird looking dog.

1221
01:00:35,570 --> 01:00:36,170
Oh.

1222
01:00:38,170 --> 01:00:38,770
Ooh.

1223
01:00:39,930 --> 01:00:40,530
Whoa.

1224
01:00:42,390 --> 01:00:45,610
Can I read that note before, like, anything happens to me?

1225
01:00:46,550 --> 01:00:48,870
God, it's when he looks back at you.

1226
01:00:49,070 --> 01:00:51,750
When he looks back at you.

1227
01:00:53,470 --> 01:00:55,170
This strange dog.

1228
01:00:56,570 --> 01:00:57,430
Anything here?

1229
01:00:59,450 --> 01:01:01,010
What a strange dog.

1230
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:06,290
It doesn't matter if he wears the dog head.

1231
01:01:06,350 --> 01:01:09,670
It's just freaky in general when he looks back at you like that.

1232
01:01:09,830 --> 01:01:10,790
Oh, there he is.

1233
01:01:10,850 --> 01:01:12,490
He's crawling again.

1234
01:01:15,750 --> 01:01:17,030
Cas, I'm not gonna run.

1235
01:01:17,270 --> 01:01:19,410
It just makes it scarier when I'm running.

1236
01:01:20,030 --> 01:01:23,470
I feel more comfortable, like, walking at a leisurely pace.

1237
01:01:24,550 --> 01:01:25,030
Okay.

1238
01:01:25,390 --> 01:01:26,670
Cas, I'll go this way.

1239
01:01:29,410 --> 01:01:30,250
I don't know.

1240
01:01:30,470 --> 01:01:33,050
It just feels more comfortable just walking over.

1241
01:01:34,850 --> 01:01:37,690
Cas, it's like there's nothing chasing me right now.

1242
01:01:37,790 --> 01:01:39,850
So, like, I don't know.

1243
01:01:39,930 --> 01:01:42,330
There's no need to run if there's nothing chasing me.

1244
01:01:43,670 --> 01:01:46,950
So, like, we get to absorb our... Oh, there he is.

1245
01:01:48,370 --> 01:01:48,850
Hello.

1246
01:01:50,050 --> 01:01:50,490
Hey.

1247
01:01:53,910 --> 01:01:54,390
Whoa!

1248
01:01:54,390 --> 01:01:55,170
Ah, shit!

1249
01:01:55,230 --> 01:01:55,510
Okay.

1250
01:01:55,670 --> 01:01:56,650
That's not a good dodge.

1251
01:01:56,790 --> 01:01:58,930
I don't know when he fucking does the thing!

1252
01:01:59,350 --> 01:02:01,310
Like, how am I supposed to know?

1253
01:02:01,390 --> 01:02:02,130
Get down!

1254
01:02:02,670 --> 01:02:03,590
Get down!

1255
01:02:04,590 --> 01:02:05,350
Don't worry.

1256
01:02:05,490 --> 01:02:07,410
My stick is not gonna break.

1257
01:02:07,730 --> 01:02:08,210
Right?

1258
01:02:08,390 --> 01:02:08,790
Oh, god.

1259
01:02:08,870 --> 01:02:09,870
I hope he doesn't break.

1260
01:02:10,510 --> 01:02:10,990
Okay.

1261
01:02:11,070 --> 01:02:11,550
We're five.

1262
01:02:12,230 --> 01:02:12,750
Alright.

1263
01:02:13,130 --> 01:02:14,370
Do I have self-heal?

1264
01:02:15,330 --> 01:02:17,130
I don't think I have self-heal.

1265
01:02:20,250 --> 01:02:20,770
Equipment.

1266
01:02:20,770 --> 01:02:21,510
Oh, yes.

1267
01:02:21,930 --> 01:02:23,230
A wooden plank.

1268
01:02:23,450 --> 01:02:23,670
Okay.

1269
01:02:25,830 --> 01:02:26,870
Stop resisting!

1270
01:02:29,670 --> 01:02:30,190
Alright.

1271
01:02:30,630 --> 01:02:33,190
I don't know when he, like, charges up the kick.

1272
01:02:33,630 --> 01:02:34,730
Use the needle?

1273
01:02:34,970 --> 01:02:36,650
I don't wanna use the needle.

1274
01:02:37,450 --> 01:02:47,290
Guys, like, what if I get, like, a fucking like, what if I get isn't, like, like, what are those diseases you get from sharing needles?

1275
01:02:47,590 --> 01:02:50,990
Like, is my radio even on?

1276
01:02:51,050 --> 01:02:54,090
It never even fucking went Okay.

1277
01:02:57,070 --> 01:02:58,550
I need to know my inventory.

1278
01:02:59,230 --> 01:03:01,290
The fuck is my radio?

1279
01:03:04,650 --> 01:03:05,770
No, it is on.

1280
01:03:05,910 --> 01:03:06,230
Okay.

1281
01:03:07,310 --> 01:03:10,150
Yeah, I could get, like, James is gonna get AIDS!

1282
01:03:10,510 --> 01:03:12,930
You don't want James to get AIDS?

1283
01:03:14,470 --> 01:03:16,050
Okay, put down to 90?

1284
01:03:16,310 --> 01:03:16,590
Okay.

1285
01:03:17,730 --> 01:03:18,230
Alright.

1286
01:03:18,650 --> 01:03:19,170
What was it?

1287
01:03:19,250 --> 01:03:20,170
Ambient or effects?

1288
01:03:20,290 --> 01:03:21,910
I assume it's effects, right?

1289
01:03:22,030 --> 01:03:22,450
Okay.

1290
01:03:22,910 --> 01:03:23,410
Effects.

1291
01:03:23,710 --> 01:03:24,310
There we go.

1292
01:03:26,950 --> 01:03:27,450
HIV?

1293
01:03:27,450 --> 01:03:27,950
STD?

1294
01:03:28,070 --> 01:03:28,990
I could get everything!

1295
01:03:29,930 --> 01:03:31,590
We don't know where this needle's been?

1296
01:03:33,230 --> 01:03:34,470
Okay, I'll use the needle.

1297
01:03:36,050 --> 01:03:37,710
Oh, I drank the health potion.

1298
01:03:37,910 --> 01:03:38,170
Okay.

1299
01:03:38,810 --> 01:03:39,130
That's a lot better.

1300
01:03:39,370 --> 01:03:41,690
Alright, we'll use the needle as a last resort.

1301
01:03:42,150 --> 01:03:42,930
Hello, sir.

1302
01:03:43,870 --> 01:03:44,910
I'm coming for you!

1303
01:03:47,150 --> 01:03:47,590
Okay.

1304
01:03:47,590 --> 01:03:49,030
Oh, now he vomits?

1305
01:03:49,290 --> 01:03:50,030
Okay, there we go.

1306
01:03:50,110 --> 01:03:50,890
I got the strap down.

1307
01:03:51,150 --> 01:03:51,710
That's right.

1308
01:03:51,750 --> 01:03:52,230
Get down!

1309
01:03:52,470 --> 01:03:53,370
Get down!

1310
01:03:54,170 --> 01:03:55,030
There we go.

1311
01:03:56,090 --> 01:03:56,790
There we go.

1312
01:03:56,830 --> 01:03:58,510
They're not real, so this isn't murder.

1313
01:04:00,090 --> 01:04:00,530
Guys.

1314
01:04:01,250 --> 01:04:02,990
They're not real, so it's not murder.

1315
01:04:04,650 --> 01:04:06,970
Okay, I just need to hit once and then run.

1316
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:08,290
And then dodge.

1317
01:04:08,810 --> 01:04:09,410
That's the strat.

1318
01:04:10,650 --> 01:04:13,310
I'm literally beating up my imagination, guys.

1319
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:16,030
Like, at best, I'm just a sociopath.

1320
01:04:16,310 --> 01:04:16,710
Like...

1321
01:04:18,310 --> 01:04:20,330
That's like, at best...

1322
01:04:20,330 --> 01:04:22,250
At best, I'm a sociopath.

1323
01:04:22,350 --> 01:04:23,970
And at worst, I'm a psychopath.

1324
01:04:26,190 --> 01:04:28,430
I'm literally just beating up my imagination.

1325
01:04:33,170 --> 01:04:34,370
Ah, jeez.

1326
01:04:34,410 --> 01:04:35,390
Why is...

1327
01:04:38,010 --> 01:04:38,890
Get down.

1328
01:04:39,090 --> 01:04:39,450
Get down.

1329
01:04:39,450 --> 01:04:39,830
Oh, shit!

1330
01:04:39,870 --> 01:04:41,390
You double-tap?!

1331
01:04:41,390 --> 01:04:42,830
Oh, shit!

1332
01:04:43,670 --> 01:04:45,310
It's cause he crawled on the ground!

1333
01:04:45,750 --> 01:04:47,510
Bro, don't make me use my needle!

1334
01:04:48,650 --> 01:04:50,170
Holy shit.

1335
01:04:50,990 --> 01:04:52,290
God, I wish they dropped loot.

1336
01:04:53,290 --> 01:04:53,730
Alright.

1337
01:04:56,190 --> 01:04:57,250
Alright, here we go.

1338
01:04:59,210 --> 01:05:00,450
Oh, there's a police car.

1339
01:05:00,590 --> 01:05:00,950
Clearly.

1340
01:05:01,390 --> 01:05:02,630
That should be a good sign.

1341
01:05:05,750 --> 01:05:07,210
Where the fuck is the bar?

1342
01:05:09,410 --> 01:05:11,530
They look like monsters to you!

1343
01:05:13,130 --> 01:05:14,210
They're not real!

1344
01:05:14,570 --> 01:05:15,850
They're not real people!

1345
01:05:16,150 --> 01:05:18,230
I'm not murdering anybody, I swear!

1346
01:05:20,090 --> 01:05:21,030
Okay, it's here.

1347
01:05:22,670 --> 01:05:25,030
They're trying to make me use my fucking needles!

1348
01:05:26,770 --> 01:05:27,350
Hello?

1349
01:05:29,170 --> 01:05:30,770
Oh, this seems safe.

1350
01:05:31,670 --> 01:05:36,230
I don't know what got into him, but he just started smashing the thing.

1351
01:05:36,330 --> 01:05:37,430
I had to throw him out.

1352
01:05:37,970 --> 01:05:39,110
He ran up, cried.

1353
01:05:39,210 --> 01:05:40,090
He fixed everything.

1354
01:05:40,550 --> 01:05:41,570
I gathered up what I could.

1355
01:05:41,670 --> 01:05:44,170
I still haven't found one of the buttons.

1356
01:05:44,310 --> 01:05:47,090
Half the record is still lodged inside, but the other part is missing.

1357
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:50,090
Figured he must have come to think of it.

1358
01:05:50,150 --> 01:05:51,630
He did run towards Groovy.

1359
01:05:52,010 --> 01:05:54,390
Anyway, maybe go check up on him, if he's alright.

1360
01:05:54,790 --> 01:05:56,850
He lives over at Salt by the pharmacy.

1361
01:05:57,010 --> 01:05:57,710
Apartment 9.

1362
01:05:58,430 --> 01:06:00,190
Okay, I feel like I have to go back.

1363
01:06:00,470 --> 01:06:01,370
Apartment 9?

1364
01:06:01,650 --> 01:06:02,710
Or whatever the fuck?

1365
01:06:02,810 --> 01:06:04,670
Okay, there's apparently something at the police trunk.

1366
01:06:05,390 --> 01:06:06,170
There was a police car?

1367
01:06:07,090 --> 01:06:09,530
Guys, I was doing so much murder, I couldn't tell.

1368
01:06:10,490 --> 01:06:14,990
Not murder, sorry, just, you know, beating up my imagination.

1369
01:06:16,030 --> 01:06:17,490
I can't even open this.

1370
01:06:18,310 --> 01:06:18,750
Liars?

1371
01:06:23,070 --> 01:06:23,930
There's nothing here.

1372
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:28,090
Ugh.

1373
01:06:29,230 --> 01:06:30,770
Ugh, I don't like that.

1374
01:06:33,130 --> 01:06:34,530
Oh, can I use my plank?

1375
01:06:38,330 --> 01:06:39,050
This?

1376
01:06:39,790 --> 01:06:40,750
Oh, shit.

1377
01:06:43,230 --> 01:06:43,950
And now what?

1378
01:06:47,250 --> 01:06:48,250
There's nothing here though.

1379
01:06:49,530 --> 01:06:52,190
The fuck do I break the police car for?

1380
01:06:56,290 --> 01:06:57,330
Nothing here.

1381
01:06:59,030 --> 01:07:00,930
Now I'm a criminal.

1382
01:07:01,310 --> 01:07:01,490
No!

1383
01:07:01,930 --> 01:07:04,070
My chat told me to!

1384
01:07:05,210 --> 01:07:05,930
Like...

1385
01:07:07,990 --> 01:07:09,530
I just got...

1386
01:07:09,530 --> 01:07:11,090
Fuck the police.

1387
01:07:12,490 --> 01:07:13,290
No!

1388
01:07:14,470 --> 01:07:16,450
Now I am a criminal!

1389
01:07:17,030 --> 01:07:19,310
This is my chat's fault!

1390
01:07:20,590 --> 01:07:23,110
They told me to do it!

1391
01:07:23,770 --> 01:07:23,950
No!

1392
01:07:24,450 --> 01:07:26,250
I got it.

1393
01:07:26,330 --> 01:07:29,130
I got baited!

1394
01:07:29,330 --> 01:07:32,830
There was no reason for me to beat up the cop car!

1395
01:07:33,690 --> 01:07:36,870
That is vandalism, Toji.

1396
01:07:37,430 --> 01:07:39,210
You guys told me to vandalize!

1397
01:07:39,330 --> 01:07:40,770
I thought get lewd!

1398
01:07:42,030 --> 01:07:46,970
I can't believe I can't believe you guys baited me into fucking vandalism.

1399
01:07:47,050 --> 01:07:53,590
I was just fucking beating up like my imaginary enemy, my imaginary friends.

1400
01:07:59,120 --> 01:08:00,600
Chad told you to.

1401
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:02,280
I didn't take my meds, officer!

1402
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:06,020
Thank you for the super challenge, I'll take a thank you.

1403
01:08:07,580 --> 01:08:08,660
What is this?

1404
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:10,880
What is this?

1405
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:11,640
Oh, is this a puzzle?

1406
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:14,000
Fuck.

1407
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:14,860
Okay, fuck.

1408
01:08:14,940 --> 01:08:17,360
I wish I could see what that is.

1409
01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:19,700
It's a yellow disk.

1410
01:08:22,260 --> 01:08:22,860
No,

1411
01:08:28,020 --> 01:08:29,640
it's a jukebox.

1412
01:08:29,900 --> 01:08:30,300
Okay.

1413
01:08:31,100 --> 01:08:36,060
What the fuck?

1414
01:08:39,140 --> 01:08:40,440
What the fuck am I supposed to do?

1415
01:08:44,310 --> 01:08:45,070
Oh, okay.

1416
01:08:50,860 --> 01:08:51,680
Not that?

1417
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:55,460
Oh, I need to find a vinyl.

1418
01:08:57,820 --> 01:08:58,780
It's for later?

1419
01:08:59,020 --> 01:09:00,320
Well, I sort of solved it.

1420
01:09:01,360 --> 01:09:01,840
Okay.

1421
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:04,840
I just need to find the item.

1422
01:09:07,360 --> 01:09:09,740
No, I totally- I barely solved it!

1423
01:09:13,610 --> 01:09:15,610
Okay, I can't be here yet.

1424
01:09:15,690 --> 01:09:16,370
I need a key.

1425
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:20,480
Okay.

1426
01:09:20,580 --> 01:09:20,660
Okay.

1427
01:09:22,300 --> 01:09:23,460
No, you didn't?

1428
01:09:23,580 --> 01:09:25,520
Then what the fuck did I do?

1429
01:09:29,560 --> 01:09:29,960
What?

1430
01:09:30,340 --> 01:09:31,220
Is that not it?

1431
01:09:31,420 --> 01:09:33,020
Yeah, I can't do anything right now.

1432
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:37,560
I don't have a thing to fix that.

1433
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:41,540
I'm not fucking engine- I don't even know what my actual job is.

1434
01:09:49,020 --> 01:09:50,340
Like, what's my job?

1435
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:54,180
What do I- There was a hole here, it's gone now.

1436
01:09:57,710 --> 01:09:58,110
What?

1437
01:10:00,850 --> 01:10:01,250
What?

1438
01:10:01,250 --> 01:10:01,770
What do I do?

1439
01:10:03,530 --> 01:10:04,970
Do I have to go to the apartment?

1440
01:10:05,430 --> 01:10:07,150
Oh, I have to go to the music store!

1441
01:10:07,370 --> 01:10:08,470
To get the thing!

1442
01:10:08,890 --> 01:10:12,170
Do I go to the apartment first or the music store?

1443
01:10:13,270 --> 01:10:14,390
Where do I go first?

1444
01:10:16,150 --> 01:10:20,850
Oh yeah, is that the reference to the game where I was trapped in the room?

1445
01:10:27,170 --> 01:10:27,970
Up to you.

1446
01:10:29,230 --> 01:10:30,050
Play it for you.

1447
01:10:30,070 --> 01:10:31,610
I don't know.

1448
01:10:34,210 --> 01:10:35,750
Which one do I do?

1449
01:10:35,890 --> 01:10:37,510
The music store or the apartment?

1450
01:10:38,590 --> 01:10:40,410
Guys, I don't like free will.

1451
01:10:40,690 --> 01:10:45,830
I don't- This is not in the original!

1452
01:10:47,790 --> 01:10:49,450
Okay, apartment is progress?

1453
01:10:49,730 --> 01:10:51,450
Okay, I'll go to the music store then.

1454
01:10:52,850 --> 01:10:53,390
Alright.

1455
01:10:55,130 --> 01:10:57,690
I don't have a lot of meds, I just realized.

1456
01:10:57,870 --> 01:11:02,450
Which is great, because I don't- Which is great, guys, by the way.

1457
01:11:03,230 --> 01:11:04,110
It's like...

1458
01:11:04,110 --> 01:11:05,370
You know...

1459
01:11:07,130 --> 01:11:09,810
I don't want to prove the doctors right.

1460
01:11:13,170 --> 01:11:15,150
Alright, off to the music store I'll go.

1461
01:11:15,270 --> 01:11:16,090
Look, there's the dead guy.

1462
01:11:19,150 --> 01:11:19,590
Alright.

1463
01:11:19,770 --> 01:11:20,770
I gotta make sure!

1464
01:11:20,970 --> 01:11:22,310
What if it comes back to life?

1465
01:11:23,050 --> 01:11:23,490
Chat!

1466
01:11:25,090 --> 01:11:30,450
Alright, I hope the maps are actual pauses, because I'm like fucking progressively lost.

1467
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:35,040
Alright.

1468
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:38,260
Double tap.

1469
01:11:39,020 --> 01:11:41,300
I don't know when they come back, like Resident Evil.

1470
01:11:41,580 --> 01:11:44,700
We'll have to go through to get to the furry convention!

1471
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:47,560
Thank you for the super chat!

1472
01:11:47,660 --> 01:11:48,040
Thank you!

1473
01:11:50,460 --> 01:11:51,020
Alright.

1474
01:11:52,340 --> 01:11:53,500
Alright, music store.

1475
01:11:55,260 --> 01:11:56,300
Oh, there he is.

1476
01:11:57,760 --> 01:11:59,440
Alright, get over here.

1477
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,280
If I hit first...

1478
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:03,840
Oh, fucker!

1479
01:12:07,990 --> 01:12:09,590
And now you kick me!

1480
01:12:09,810 --> 01:12:10,850
You're such a whore!

1481
01:12:11,350 --> 01:12:12,990
You're such a whore!

1482
01:12:12,990 --> 01:12:14,990
Why am I such a pervert?

1483
01:12:15,450 --> 01:12:19,650
Oh my god!

1484
01:12:19,670 --> 01:12:20,310
Oh my god!

1485
01:12:20,430 --> 01:12:21,210
The third party!

1486
01:12:21,450 --> 01:12:24,550
Oh my god, the third party out of nowhere!

1487
01:12:27,110 --> 01:12:29,490
Oh my god, I'm only...

1488
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:30,590
I'm a whore.

1489
01:12:30,690 --> 01:12:32,610
They're a whore because I'm a whore.

1490
01:12:32,750 --> 01:12:33,850
Now I'm angry!

1491
01:12:35,350 --> 01:12:36,530
Oh, there's one there.

1492
01:12:36,610 --> 01:12:37,030
Nice.

1493
01:12:38,010 --> 01:12:38,690
Alright.

1494
01:12:39,870 --> 01:12:40,830
Oh my god, geez.

1495
01:12:40,850 --> 01:12:42,330
Why are you such a pervert?

1496
01:12:43,150 --> 01:12:45,390
I got handgun ammo.

1497
01:12:45,470 --> 01:12:46,970
I don't even have a gun yet.

1498
01:12:49,210 --> 01:12:51,810
Why am I such a pervert?

1499
01:12:52,590 --> 01:12:54,550
It's true though!

1500
01:12:54,710 --> 01:12:57,750
That's the reason why they're all so freaky!

1501
01:12:58,370 --> 01:12:59,670
It's like...

1502
01:13:00,930 --> 01:13:02,270
Oh no!

1503
01:13:02,810 --> 01:13:03,550
Oh no!

1504
01:13:04,150 --> 01:13:06,770
Why did I have to think of them like this?

1505
01:13:08,270 --> 01:13:11,750
I already broke one police car.

1506
01:13:11,830 --> 01:13:12,530
What's one more?

1507
01:13:13,630 --> 01:13:17,070
PSA in the Silent Hill games, you don't need to kill every enemy in the streets if you want to save.

1508
01:13:17,090 --> 01:13:17,570
Who knows?

1509
01:13:17,630 --> 01:13:18,570
It's the same here.

1510
01:13:18,830 --> 01:13:19,650
Too late.

1511
01:13:20,250 --> 01:13:21,010
Too late.

1512
01:13:21,070 --> 01:13:22,710
I'm gonna do something wild.

1513
01:13:24,030 --> 01:13:26,610
Oh, I don't have... Oh, the syringe is not health?

1514
01:13:27,250 --> 01:13:29,210
What do you mean the syringe isn't health?

1515
01:13:30,010 --> 01:13:30,790
Okay, alright.

1516
01:13:31,050 --> 01:13:31,710
There we go.

1517
01:13:31,710 --> 01:13:34,010
Alright guys, I have no more health.

1518
01:13:36,890 --> 01:13:39,450
Oh no, how could I possibly avoid that?

1519
01:13:39,870 --> 01:13:43,950
How could I possibly avoid using my health?

1520
01:13:44,330 --> 01:13:45,330
Oh man.

1521
01:13:45,450 --> 01:13:46,790
If only I know how.

1522
01:13:48,250 --> 01:13:51,330
If only there was a way to stop me from that.

1523
01:13:55,880 --> 01:13:56,480
Hello?

1524
01:13:58,660 --> 01:13:59,680
Oh no.

1525
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:00,240
Hello?

1526
01:14:03,740 --> 01:14:04,340
Okay.

1527
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:05,620
Oh, there's two.

1528
01:14:06,420 --> 01:14:08,120
Like, can I just...

1529
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:10,300
Okay, if I like...

1530
01:14:10,300 --> 01:14:10,560
What?

1531
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:11,700
Okay.

1532
01:14:13,180 --> 01:14:13,840
What?

1533
01:14:15,020 --> 01:14:18,180
The fucking projectile bomb that gets me there?

1534
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:20,540
That's fucking dumb.

1535
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:21,900
Fuck off.

1536
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:25,720
Okay, that's not fair.

1537
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:28,320
Can I like... That's not fair.

1538
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:31,000
Like, what the fuck is this range?

1539
01:14:32,820 --> 01:14:34,160
Oh my god.

1540
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:35,180
Oh my god.

1541
01:14:35,260 --> 01:14:38,420
Like, what is this garbage brain set?

1542
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:39,480
You fucker!

1543
01:14:39,480 --> 01:14:40,500
You double tapped!

1544
01:14:40,940 --> 01:14:42,400
You fucker!

1545
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:45,240
Now it's a vomit too?

1546
01:14:47,720 --> 01:14:49,320
Holy shit.

1547
01:14:50,240 --> 01:14:51,040
Okay.

1548
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:54,980
James, you're such a fucking freak.

1549
01:14:55,700 --> 01:14:58,580
Bro, I literally just killed.

1550
01:15:00,720 --> 01:15:02,400
Oh my god.

1551
01:15:02,540 --> 01:15:04,660
This is all your fault, James.

1552
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:06,360
I couldn't even read.

1553
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:09,140
Okay, where's my memo sheet?

1554
01:15:10,780 --> 01:15:11,520
Oh my god.

1555
01:15:11,560 --> 01:15:12,760
I just literally healed too.

1556
01:15:13,820 --> 01:15:15,440
Okay, uh, investigate.

1557
01:15:15,660 --> 01:15:16,320
There we go.

1558
01:15:17,740 --> 01:15:20,100
The janitor came the other day, drunken in tears.

1559
01:15:20,300 --> 01:15:21,540
Had half a record with him.

1560
01:15:21,580 --> 01:15:22,960
Kept yelling we gotta fix it somehow.

1561
01:15:23,300 --> 01:15:25,060
I was willing to do it just to shut him up.

1562
01:15:25,260 --> 01:15:31,300
So, I got up to get the glue from the cabinet, but then he realized he only had one half, so he ran out.

1563
01:15:31,640 --> 01:15:33,040
Can't do much about the record.

1564
01:15:33,220 --> 01:15:35,300
Maybe ask your Aunt Neely's next time you're there.

1565
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:36,340
Might be one of theirs.

1566
01:15:38,420 --> 01:15:39,540
Oh my god.

1567
01:15:39,940 --> 01:15:42,000
I can't bel- It is his fault!

1568
01:15:42,140 --> 01:15:43,660
This is like in his mind!

1569
01:15:44,280 --> 01:15:45,720
It's literally his fault!

1570
01:15:47,240 --> 01:15:48,120
Alright, here we go.

1571
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:51,960
Like, James!

1572
01:15:52,280 --> 01:15:55,240
God, if you were gonna imagine these freaks.

1573
01:15:55,320 --> 01:15:57,960
Bro, keep it out of the fucking bedroom.

1574
01:16:00,040 --> 01:16:03,000
Like, sorry, keep it in the bed- Sorry, no, keep it in the bedroom.

1575
01:16:03,140 --> 01:16:03,740
Holy shit.

1576
01:16:03,900 --> 01:16:04,760
Face the music.

1577
01:16:05,820 --> 01:16:08,620
Oh my god, I'm dying.

1578
01:16:08,700 --> 01:16:10,380
I'm actually di- Ow!

1579
01:16:10,820 --> 01:16:12,820
They're the easiest enemies!

1580
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:17,120
How am I dying, you fucker!

1581
01:16:18,020 --> 01:16:19,500
I can't tell!

1582
01:16:19,580 --> 01:16:22,400
Your patterns are are so inconsistent!

1583
01:16:23,420 --> 01:16:27,900
Like, you vomit, and then you fucking headbutt, and then you kick!

1584
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,120
There's no windup!

1585
01:16:29,220 --> 01:16:30,900
There's no fucking windup!

1586
01:16:31,200 --> 01:16:36,120
Like- There's- There's no- There's no windup!

1587
01:16:36,200 --> 01:16:38,320
I was playing Wukong for so long!

1588
01:16:38,860 --> 01:16:42,960
Like- It's not fair.

1589
01:16:43,300 --> 01:16:45,040
It's not fair!

1590
01:16:45,320 --> 01:16:46,360
It's not fair!

1591
01:16:47,320 --> 01:16:48,360
It's not fair!

1592
01:16:49,240 --> 01:16:50,360
It's not fair!

1593
01:16:52,180 --> 01:16:52,980
Okay.

1594
01:16:55,340 --> 01:16:55,740
Alright.

1595
01:16:57,820 --> 01:17:01,220
Okay, let's unlock this door.

1596
01:17:01,560 --> 01:17:05,760
I know, like, I didn't have to break, like, three windows, but I'm literally dying right now.

1597
01:17:06,100 --> 01:17:08,040
Like, I feel like I'm exempt from that.

1598
01:17:08,100 --> 01:17:09,380
I'm literally fucking dying.

1599
01:17:13,540 --> 01:17:13,980
Okay.

1600
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:20,000
Alright.

1601
01:17:20,300 --> 01:17:21,240
Is there any heals?

1602
01:17:21,820 --> 01:17:24,380
Like, where are the fucking heals?!

1603
01:17:26,460 --> 01:17:27,640
Where are the heals?!

1604
01:17:27,640 --> 01:17:28,720
Holy shit!

1605
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:31,200
Where's the mechas in this game?!

1606
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:33,760
Oh my god.

1607
01:17:33,860 --> 01:17:34,700
Oh my god.

1608
01:17:34,780 --> 01:17:35,620
Oh, there it is.

1609
01:17:36,280 --> 01:17:37,160
Thank god.

1610
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:37,560
Okay.

1611
01:17:38,020 --> 01:17:38,500
Drink.

1612
01:17:38,740 --> 01:17:39,760
Drink, my boy.

1613
01:17:40,720 --> 01:17:41,720
Drink, my boy.

1614
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:44,960
Okay, I found one heal.

1615
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:46,360
Thank god.

1616
01:17:46,420 --> 01:17:49,000
Who the fuck puts a health thing in the cabinet?

1617
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:52,060
Now I'm gonna smash everything.

1618
01:17:52,380 --> 01:17:53,260
They're so aggressive!

1619
01:17:53,660 --> 01:17:57,020
They don't need, like- The doors don't wind up!

1620
01:17:57,620 --> 01:18:00,960
Literally, they just fucking- They just beat the shit out of me!

1621
01:18:04,620 --> 01:18:07,880
They just go in and beat the shit out of me!

1622
01:18:07,940 --> 01:18:08,560
Like, what the fuck?

1623
01:18:13,060 --> 01:18:14,480
Oh my god.

1624
01:18:14,940 --> 01:18:20,080
They just go right in and just start throwing up, headbutting, kicking and screaming.

1625
01:18:23,420 --> 01:18:24,600
Okay, here we go.

1626
01:18:26,300 --> 01:18:27,600
Swear to fucking god.

1627
01:18:32,300 --> 01:18:36,120
The door that wakes in darkness opening into nightmares.

1628
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:37,800
Oh, I guess that's where German Head is.

1629
01:18:39,160 --> 01:18:40,460
Is there extra loot?

1630
01:18:40,680 --> 01:18:41,120
Please.

1631
01:18:41,220 --> 01:18:42,180
I'm so desperate.

1632
01:18:45,300 --> 01:18:46,200
Oh my god.

1633
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:48,720
Kingdom Hearts?

1634
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:52,020
The door that was- Okay.

1635
01:18:53,840 --> 01:18:54,400
What?

1636
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:56,600
I don't like that.

1637
01:18:57,620 --> 01:18:59,620
Okay, I clearly can't go in yet.

1638
01:19:00,180 --> 01:19:01,120
Okay, I clearly can't go in yet.

1639
01:19:01,540 --> 01:19:02,200
Oh my god.

1640
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:03,500
Who cares?

1641
01:19:03,680 --> 01:19:06,080
Who cares about this man's fucking car?

1642
01:19:06,820 --> 01:19:07,840
What about me?

1643
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:11,080
Guys, do you care about me?

1644
01:19:15,540 --> 01:19:17,660
I don't remember this part, Sora.

1645
01:19:18,580 --> 01:19:19,560
Gosh, Sora.

1646
01:19:20,660 --> 01:19:22,720
It seems we're in Silent Hill.

1647
01:19:25,700 --> 01:19:27,040
What the fuck?

1648
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:31,400
Oh shit, he's fucking crawling.

1649
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:32,580
Oh shit, oh.

1650
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:35,320
Whoa, what the fuck?

1651
01:19:35,340 --> 01:19:36,220
That hits me!

1652
01:19:36,360 --> 01:19:38,060
He's laying on the ground!

1653
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:40,060
Oh my god!

1654
01:19:40,140 --> 01:19:41,620
You fu- How?

1655
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:43,800
Oh my god!

1656
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:45,220
How the fuck you?

1657
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:46,240
Fuck you!

1658
01:19:49,720 --> 01:19:51,080
Fuck you!

1659
01:19:51,260 --> 01:19:52,940
I hate this game.

1660
01:19:54,780 --> 01:19:57,860
He's just nipping my ankles and I still get hit.

1661
01:19:58,220 --> 01:20:02,140
I can still get fucking hit.

1662
01:20:02,260 --> 01:20:03,540
This is so bullshit!

1663
01:20:04,920 --> 01:20:08,580
I fucking nipped my ankles and it fucked me up!

1664
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:14,980
Oh my god, I'm not having a good day at Silent Hill.

1665
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:20,660
Your patterns are inconsistent.

1666
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:24,340
The man was here again.

1667
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:26,460
I told him he's been warned not to come here.

1668
01:20:26,620 --> 01:20:28,980
He acted like he didn't know what I was talking about.

1669
01:20:29,100 --> 01:20:30,720
Anyway, he got up and left.

1670
01:20:30,820 --> 01:20:35,400
He didn't make any sort of fuss, but there's something about him that gives me the creeps.

1671
01:20:35,420 --> 01:20:38,240
When I look at his face, it looks like I'm staring- Oh my god, it's me!

1672
01:20:38,380 --> 01:20:39,780
I'm staring at a mask.

1673
01:20:39,900 --> 01:20:43,460
And there's something underneath waiting to get out.

1674
01:20:43,620 --> 01:20:46,520
I don't want to be there when that happens.

1675
01:20:49,960 --> 01:20:50,580
That's me.

1676
01:20:51,780 --> 01:20:52,380
That's me.

1677
01:20:53,140 --> 01:20:54,980
There's another man with a mask?

1678
01:20:55,160 --> 01:20:56,100
How dare he?

1679
01:20:56,760 --> 01:20:58,520
Can I explore this diner more?

1680
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:01,400
God, I don't fucking know anymore.

1681
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:03,300
It's so lit.

1682
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:06,700
This is the reason why I hate survival.

1683
01:21:06,980 --> 01:21:08,920
Oh my god, are you fucking serious?

1684
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:09,680
Get over here.

1685
01:21:10,040 --> 01:21:12,180
Get your ass- Yeah, yeah, I'm talking about you!

1686
01:21:12,420 --> 01:21:14,160
Yeah, I'm talking about you!

1687
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:15,460
Get your ass over here!

1688
01:21:16,360 --> 01:21:18,960
Yeah, stop looking- I'm talking to you!

1689
01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:19,760
Yes, you!

1690
01:21:20,200 --> 01:21:23,000
Oh, you're gonna walk away, you fucker!

1691
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:25,400
Get you over here, you fuck!

1692
01:21:28,040 --> 01:21:31,040
Oh, he's just gonna walk- Oh, this little asshole.

1693
01:21:31,400 --> 01:21:32,180
Get over here.

1694
01:21:32,300 --> 01:21:34,980
Get your ass over here, I'm talking to you!

1695
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:37,960
Yes!

1696
01:21:38,820 --> 01:21:39,520
Come on!

1697
01:21:40,680 --> 01:21:42,660
They scared- Come here!

1698
01:21:44,240 --> 01:21:45,900
Oh, you guys throw up, aren't ya?

1699
01:21:46,460 --> 01:21:47,700
That's fucking right.

1700
01:21:48,300 --> 01:21:51,100
God, use your stupid projectile vomit!

1701
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:53,900
Your stupid ass projectile vomit right now.

1702
01:21:54,360 --> 01:21:55,900
Oh, you think I don't know?

1703
01:21:56,060 --> 01:22:00,660
Are you so- Oh my god, I was gonna say- I was gonna say, if he fucking like- Oh god.

1704
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:01,320
God.

1705
01:22:02,940 --> 01:22:03,500
Dodge!

1706
01:22:03,500 --> 01:22:04,060
Dodge!

1707
01:22:04,460 --> 01:22:05,020
Dodge!

1708
01:22:05,420 --> 01:22:05,980
Dodge!

1709
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:07,040
Dodge!

1710
01:22:07,220 --> 01:22:08,180
That's right!

1711
01:22:08,360 --> 01:22:11,100
I fucking downloaded- Oh, he just missed it, guys.

1712
01:22:13,400 --> 01:22:14,720
That's fucking right.

1713
01:22:15,280 --> 01:22:17,060
Get down, you freak.

1714
01:22:17,740 --> 01:22:18,300
Hopefully.

1715
01:22:20,100 --> 01:22:20,660
Shit.

1716
01:22:20,660 --> 01:22:21,220
Okay.

1717
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:22,480
Alright.

1718
01:22:23,560 --> 01:22:24,120
Good.

1719
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:25,420
That's good that he came over.

1720
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:26,180
I needed that.

1721
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:28,820
I hate that guy so much.

1722
01:22:28,900 --> 01:22:30,020
I hate these monsters.

1723
01:22:30,100 --> 01:22:31,820
They're like the easiest monsters, too!

1724
01:22:31,880 --> 01:22:32,960
That's the worst part!

1725
01:22:33,620 --> 01:22:35,080
They're like the easiest.

1726
01:22:36,500 --> 01:22:40,680
They're like the easiest ones in the game, so this is the worst part for me.

1727
01:22:43,440 --> 01:22:45,540
Alright, I'm abusing the third person.

1728
01:22:45,880 --> 01:22:46,760
I'm abusing it.

1729
01:22:47,320 --> 01:22:50,500
I just gotta be sure there's nothing over on this side.

1730
01:22:51,100 --> 01:22:51,820
Wait, what?

1731
01:22:53,780 --> 01:22:54,560
Wait, what?

1732
01:22:56,360 --> 01:22:57,220
Excuse me?

1733
01:22:58,440 --> 01:23:00,420
Are you- What?!

1734
01:23:01,720 --> 01:23:03,100
You don't die.

1735
01:23:04,900 --> 01:23:07,300
You're such a fucking whore!

1736
01:23:07,460 --> 01:23:09,440
You're actually a whore!

1737
01:23:09,480 --> 01:23:09,960
Forever!

1738
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:20,080
Oh my god.

1739
01:23:20,240 --> 01:23:21,800
There's no way.

1740
01:23:22,040 --> 01:23:23,240
There's no way.

1741
01:23:23,420 --> 01:23:24,760
I even triple tapped.

1742
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:27,660
I even triple tapped!

1743
01:23:28,240 --> 01:23:30,840
I- I can't believe it.

1744
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,700
I- I didn't know that.

1745
01:23:34,540 --> 01:23:36,720
I fucking...

1746
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:41,900
How many taps does it take?!

1747
01:23:42,040 --> 01:23:43,720
How many?!

1748
01:23:46,020 --> 01:23:48,180
Is that too serious?

1749
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:49,380
Are you fucking...

1750
01:23:49,380 --> 01:23:51,080
I can't...

1751
01:23:51,080 --> 01:23:54,900
I can't... I can't believe it.

1752
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:57,600
I can't believe they're still alive!

1753
01:23:58,620 --> 01:24:00,960
I can't believe it!

1754
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:03,060
Okay.

1755
01:24:04,540 --> 01:24:05,340
I can't believe it.

1756
01:24:05,460 --> 01:24:07,620
I even triple tapped him too!

1757
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:08,540
I can't!

1758
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:09,920
Please!

1759
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:12,000
There's no way!

1760
01:24:12,700 --> 01:24:15,700
Please, I don't have someone in this bed!

1761
01:24:16,820 --> 01:24:20,060
Does he- Does he revive?!

1762
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:21,780
There's no way.

1763
01:24:24,300 --> 01:24:24,960
There's no way.

1764
01:24:28,300 --> 01:24:30,380
Are you- Are you gonna come back?

1765
01:24:31,420 --> 01:24:35,280
I- I think he is dead.

1766
01:24:38,240 --> 01:24:39,460
I need to know!

1767
01:24:39,460 --> 01:24:40,520
I can't!

1768
01:24:40,520 --> 01:24:41,220
I can't!

1769
01:24:41,240 --> 01:24:43,020
I don't have a lot of health!

1770
01:24:45,220 --> 01:24:46,100
Is he dead?

1771
01:24:48,580 --> 01:24:50,840
Are you sure it's the- You're right.

1772
01:24:51,580 --> 01:24:52,440
You're right.

1773
01:24:52,540 --> 01:24:53,400
I'm sure.

1774
01:24:53,980 --> 01:24:55,240
Is he dead for real?

1775
01:24:56,760 --> 01:24:59,420
Thank you for the super chat!

1776
01:24:59,420 --> 01:25:00,240
Thank you!

1777
01:25:00,280 --> 01:25:00,980
Thank you!

1778
01:25:03,340 --> 01:25:04,140
Get up!

1779
01:25:04,760 --> 01:25:05,360
Get up!

1780
01:25:05,540 --> 01:25:06,720
Don't you fucking pretend!

1781
01:25:06,900 --> 01:25:07,300
I need to know!

1782
01:25:07,380 --> 01:25:09,320
I need to know if you just respawn!

1783
01:25:10,260 --> 01:25:13,180
I need- You're like my science experiment if you'll just get up!

1784
01:25:13,960 --> 01:25:15,120
Are you just gonna get up?

1785
01:25:16,020 --> 01:25:16,620
No, right?

1786
01:25:17,160 --> 01:25:18,040
He's dead, right?

1787
01:25:20,120 --> 01:25:21,920
I just- I need to be sure!

1788
01:25:22,240 --> 01:25:23,820
Thank you for the super chat!

1789
01:25:23,960 --> 01:25:24,380
Thank you!

1790
01:25:24,380 --> 01:25:25,000
Thank you!

1791
01:25:25,960 --> 01:25:26,580
Alright.

1792
01:25:28,360 --> 01:25:28,980
Alright.

1793
01:25:29,080 --> 01:25:29,960
Here I go!

1794
01:25:37,400 --> 01:25:38,360
Just in case.

1795
01:25:40,020 --> 01:25:41,660
I just gotta be sure.

1796
01:25:42,040 --> 01:25:42,660
Okay.

1797
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:47,260
I just gotta be sure.

1798
01:25:50,120 --> 01:25:56,060
I swear to god if I go into this room and get back up, I swear to fucking god.

1799
01:25:59,830 --> 01:26:00,450
Okay.

1800
01:26:00,750 --> 01:26:02,070
Just a- OH!

1801
01:26:02,530 --> 01:26:03,830
IT'S THE FUCKING RAT!

1802
01:26:09,380 --> 01:26:09,580
God!

1803
01:26:09,580 --> 01:26:11,200
You're such a fucker!

1804
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:12,080
I knew it!

1805
01:26:12,100 --> 01:26:13,200
I fucking knew it!

1806
01:26:13,220 --> 01:26:13,820
I knew it!

1807
01:26:13,820 --> 01:26:14,900
I knew you were pretending!

1808
01:26:15,300 --> 01:26:16,540
I fucking knew it!

1809
01:26:18,100 --> 01:26:18,960
I knew it!

1810
01:26:19,020 --> 01:26:20,320
I fucking knew it!

1811
01:26:20,320 --> 01:26:21,280
You can't fool me!

1812
01:26:21,540 --> 01:26:23,620
You can't fucking fool me!

1813
01:26:23,700 --> 01:26:24,920
You fucking...

1814
01:26:24,920 --> 01:26:28,180
I knew it!

1815
01:26:28,200 --> 01:26:28,920
I knew it!

1816
01:26:28,920 --> 01:26:29,540
I knew you were waiting!

1817
01:26:30,060 --> 01:26:34,280
You can't fool me twice!

1818
01:26:34,700 --> 01:26:36,520
You can't trick me!

1819
01:26:41,080 --> 01:26:41,760
Okay...

1820
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:42,940
Okay...

1821
01:26:42,940 --> 01:26:44,460
Okay, what is up there?

1822
01:26:44,640 --> 01:26:46,140
Before I leave...

1823
01:26:46,620 --> 01:26:48,120
He went inside!

1824
01:26:48,540 --> 01:26:50,100
I knew it!

1825
01:26:50,140 --> 01:26:51,780
I fucking knew it!

1826
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:52,420
I knew it!

1827
01:26:52,420 --> 01:26:52,420
I fucking knew it!

1828
01:26:52,420 --> 01:26:53,100
Alright...

1829
01:26:53,100 --> 01:26:54,780
Thank you for the super chat!

1830
01:26:55,240 --> 01:26:59,840
Bro was about to prank her...

1831
01:27:02,640 --> 01:27:04,340
What is actually up there?

1832
01:27:04,380 --> 01:27:08,580
I know what's up there, but he's actually trying to fucking cat me!

1833
01:27:08,740 --> 01:27:08,900
I know what's up there, but he's actually trying to fucking cat me!

1834
01:27:12,540 --> 01:27:12,900
Okay...

1835
01:27:13,260 --> 01:27:13,400
Okay...

1836
01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:16,180
IT'S JUST A... THERE'S NOTHING HERE!

1837
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:18,800
IT'S JUST AN UNKILLABLE MAD MONSTER!

1838
01:27:19,120 --> 01:27:20,160
LIKE THAT'S...

1839
01:27:20,160 --> 01:27:24,680
Oh my god, he's literally just an unkillable monster for no reason!

1840
01:27:24,920 --> 01:27:25,440
Like...

1841
01:27:26,300 --> 01:27:27,020
That's...

1842
01:27:27,020 --> 01:27:29,340
Holy shit...

1843
01:27:29,340 --> 01:27:32,940
There was no reason for him to be there!

1844
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:33,640
There's...

1845
01:27:33,640 --> 01:27:35,400
There's nothing there!

1846
01:27:37,320 --> 01:27:38,900
He's a little silly...

1847
01:27:38,900 --> 01:27:40,500
Are you...

1848
01:27:40,580 --> 01:27:42,660
Oh my god, they all respawn!

1849
01:27:43,540 --> 01:27:45,780
Oh my god, well...

1850
01:27:45,780 --> 01:27:47,940
They don't even drop loot!

1851
01:27:48,040 --> 01:27:49,300
That's the worst part!

1852
01:27:49,660 --> 01:27:51,320
They drop nothing!

1853
01:27:51,560 --> 01:27:53,160
He's a silly guy!

1854
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:59,300
I can't believe I wasted so much meds on these unkillable freaks!

1855
01:28:01,160 --> 01:28:01,900
Okay...

1856
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:05,060
Oh my god...

1857
01:28:05,060 --> 01:28:07,300
I'm gonna use the new empty save...

1858
01:28:08,360 --> 01:28:09,880
But I knew it!

1859
01:28:10,580 --> 01:28:11,240
I knew it!

1860
01:28:11,420 --> 01:28:13,860
How many times do I have to teach you this old lesson?

1861
01:28:13,960 --> 01:28:14,200
See?

1862
01:28:19,420 --> 01:28:21,480
Oh my god, I thought them...

1863
01:28:21,480 --> 01:28:22,680
No, it's the worst part!

1864
01:28:23,380 --> 01:28:24,960
There's no infinite item glitch!

1865
01:28:25,820 --> 01:28:27,820
Okay, I have to go to the apartment now.

1866
01:28:28,580 --> 01:28:30,340
He's just a silly little guy.

1867
01:28:30,580 --> 01:28:31,740
God, he's the silliest.

1868
01:28:33,620 --> 01:28:34,100
Okay...

1869
01:28:35,160 --> 01:28:38,260
These unkillable freaks are like the bane of my existence.

1870
01:28:38,260 --> 01:28:41,100
I literally wasted three fucking meds for these guys.

1871
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:44,860
Like, I thought I could kill them!

1872
01:28:45,960 --> 01:28:47,280
Does this give me a pause?

1873
01:28:47,560 --> 01:28:48,160
I don't know.

1874
01:28:49,340 --> 01:28:50,440
I'm just gonna leave.

1875
01:28:52,880 --> 01:28:56,220
The worst part is that they're gonna jumpscare me because I'm not looking back.

1876
01:29:01,660 --> 01:29:02,140
Alright.

1877
01:29:05,680 --> 01:29:07,600
I don't have the other half of it.

1878
01:29:10,820 --> 01:29:14,120
I don't have the other half of the record so I can't repair it.

1879
01:29:14,480 --> 01:29:16,120
How do I get to this guy's apartment?

1880
01:29:18,440 --> 01:29:19,520
Please don't follow me.

1881
01:29:19,560 --> 01:29:20,900
I'm trying to figure out how to get to this apartment.

1882
01:29:21,680 --> 01:29:22,260
Oh, there.

1883
01:29:26,380 --> 01:29:26,820
Hello?

1884
01:29:32,260 --> 01:29:33,140
This sucks.

1885
01:29:34,340 --> 01:29:35,600
This fucking sucks!

1886
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:39,140
Now I know they come back to life!

1887
01:29:40,660 --> 01:29:42,320
That's the worst part!

1888
01:29:43,240 --> 01:29:46,940
That's the worst part!

1889
01:29:46,940 --> 01:29:47,740
I hate it here.

1890
01:29:47,900 --> 01:29:49,880
I fucking hate it here.

1891
01:29:55,940 --> 01:29:56,660
Heels!

1892
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:01,460
Oh god, the static.

1893
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:03,740
I'm mad.

1894
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:10,660
Fuck this bug.

1895
01:30:10,740 --> 01:30:12,340
At least he doesn't come back to life.

1896
01:30:12,700 --> 01:30:15,020
At least he doesn't.

1897
01:30:15,700 --> 01:30:16,760
Fuck this.

1898
01:30:16,860 --> 01:30:17,560
Fuck this bug.

1899
01:30:17,580 --> 01:30:20,100
Fuck this one bug just because he doesn't come back to life.

1900
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:24,600
Alright.

1901
01:30:30,740 --> 01:30:31,340
Alright.

1902
01:30:32,060 --> 01:30:32,880
Let's see.

1903
01:30:33,920 --> 01:30:35,100
Oh, there's the key.

1904
01:30:36,100 --> 01:30:37,120
Number five.

1905
01:30:37,720 --> 01:30:39,520
At least I can see the key.

1906
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:42,320
Do you have health?

1907
01:30:43,100 --> 01:30:44,640
Oh, nobody has health!

1908
01:30:45,580 --> 01:30:47,340
Number five left his key.

1909
01:30:47,380 --> 01:30:48,860
Says there's a leak from upstairs.

1910
01:30:49,160 --> 01:30:50,280
Gotta check it out.

1911
01:30:50,440 --> 01:30:50,740
Okay.

1912
01:30:53,240 --> 01:30:53,800
Alright.

1913
01:30:54,960 --> 01:30:55,720
Let's go.

1914
01:30:57,540 --> 01:30:58,820
Oh my god.

1915
01:30:59,480 --> 01:31:01,120
I hate these freaks.

1916
01:31:01,660 --> 01:31:02,660
God, James.

1917
01:31:02,740 --> 01:31:04,320
Why can't you think happier thoughts?

1918
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:12,560
Like, I know your wife died from a fucking, like, disease and you gotta watch her die, but like, just be happier.

1919
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,720
You know, those people just stop being depressed.

1920
01:31:16,860 --> 01:31:17,840
Just be happy.

1921
01:31:22,620 --> 01:31:23,980
Oh my god.

1922
01:31:24,120 --> 01:31:24,460
Okay.

1923
01:31:24,680 --> 01:31:25,320
Let's see.

1924
01:31:27,120 --> 01:31:28,640
Wait, I missed something?

1925
01:31:28,820 --> 01:31:29,420
What did I miss?

1926
01:31:30,160 --> 01:31:31,400
I got everything.

1927
01:31:31,880 --> 01:31:33,560
Just don't be sad.

1928
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:39,440
The key is the world's shittiest.

1929
01:31:39,440 --> 01:31:41,300
I've never said I was licensed.

1930
01:31:44,260 --> 01:31:45,360
Didn't miss anything.

1931
01:31:45,700 --> 01:31:47,180
Oh, I could just unlock this door.

1932
01:31:47,240 --> 01:31:47,460
Yeah.

1933
01:31:49,400 --> 01:31:49,780
That's how it works.

1934
01:31:49,900 --> 01:31:53,720
James, everything could have been avoided if you just stopped being depressed.

1935
01:31:54,180 --> 01:31:54,520
That's...

1936
01:31:56,680 --> 01:31:57,160
Stop.

1937
01:31:57,340 --> 01:31:57,700
Stop.

1938
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:01,080
Okay.

1939
01:32:03,520 --> 01:32:05,940
And also, if you had friends.

1940
01:32:06,300 --> 01:32:07,440
You clearly don't have friends.

1941
01:32:07,800 --> 01:32:12,260
Like, all your friends had to be your wife's friends and now they don't hang out with you because, you know.

1942
01:32:13,060 --> 01:32:14,540
What the fuck is...

1943
01:32:14,540 --> 01:32:16,400
That looks like a person right there.

1944
01:32:16,460 --> 01:32:17,300
That freaked me out.

1945
01:32:19,400 --> 01:32:19,540
Yeah.

1946
01:32:24,380 --> 01:32:25,220
Let's see.

1947
01:32:27,660 --> 01:32:28,220
Wait.

1948
01:32:28,300 --> 01:32:32,400
Heals have diminishing returns each time so good luck with dodging.

1949
01:32:32,540 --> 01:32:33,620
Wait, what does that mean?

1950
01:32:35,020 --> 01:32:35,580
Wait.

1951
01:32:35,660 --> 01:32:36,200
What?

1952
01:32:37,400 --> 01:32:40,080
I can't believe I used all my heals on these fuckers.

1953
01:32:40,140 --> 01:32:40,800
I'm so sad.

1954
01:32:41,220 --> 01:32:42,480
Like, I didn't know.

1955
01:32:43,180 --> 01:32:44,720
I didn't know they...

1956
01:32:44,720 --> 01:32:48,280
I didn't know they'd come back to life.

1957
01:32:48,420 --> 01:32:51,880
I can't tell if you're fucking with me sometimes, chat.

1958
01:32:54,700 --> 01:32:57,520
I thought you guys were fucking with me.

1959
01:32:59,620 --> 01:33:03,000
I wouldn't have wasted my heals if I knew that.

1960
01:33:03,340 --> 01:33:08,280
I didn't know they're so bullshit.

1961
01:33:09,920 --> 01:33:10,520
Okay.

1962
01:33:10,520 --> 01:33:11,120
Um...

1963
01:33:12,940 --> 01:33:14,960
Me when I lie.

1964
01:33:16,360 --> 01:33:16,960
Alright.

1965
01:33:17,940 --> 01:33:18,540
Okay.

1966
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:19,560
450.

1967
01:33:19,640 --> 01:33:20,820
Can I have those?

1968
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:23,480
I didn't know.

1969
01:33:24,560 --> 01:33:26,800
I thought they stayed dead forever.

1970
01:33:28,940 --> 01:33:33,400
And then I have to watch one of them just come back to life being like heh heh.

1971
01:33:33,960 --> 01:33:34,520
Booyah.

1972
01:33:36,980 --> 01:33:37,540
Okay.

1973
01:33:42,720 --> 01:33:43,760
Oh, come on.

1974
01:33:45,560 --> 01:33:47,220
I didn't remember.

1975
01:33:48,420 --> 01:33:50,380
I didn't remember they came back alive.

1976
01:33:51,320 --> 01:33:53,000
All I remember was like...

1977
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:56,380
like they were... they burned the cop lady.

1978
01:34:00,840 --> 01:34:01,920
Where is he?

1979
01:34:05,140 --> 01:34:06,460
I don't like this.

1980
01:34:10,470 --> 01:34:11,610
Clearly here.

1981
01:34:17,460 --> 01:34:19,380
Like, he's clearly here!

1982
01:34:20,020 --> 01:34:22,040
Okay, that's where I have to go.

1983
01:34:28,870 --> 01:34:29,530
What?

1984
01:34:32,730 --> 01:34:34,530
Like, he's here!

1985
01:34:36,490 --> 01:34:36,970
Oh.

1986
01:34:40,400 --> 01:34:41,920
Oh no, guys, I'm scared.

1987
01:34:42,660 --> 01:34:43,600
Guys, I'm scared.

1988
01:34:51,950 --> 01:34:53,770
Okay, I gotta be... oh, I'm scared.

1989
01:34:53,890 --> 01:34:54,910
I'm actually scared, guys.

1990
01:34:54,970 --> 01:34:55,210
Wait.

1991
01:34:56,070 --> 01:34:57,410
Why is there a cubby here?

1992
01:35:00,390 --> 01:35:01,070
Knock knock!

1993
01:35:02,550 --> 01:35:03,270
Knock knock!

1994
01:35:03,790 --> 01:35:04,270
Okay.

1995
01:35:05,950 --> 01:35:06,970
Can I go upstairs?

1996
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:12,660
Oh my god.

1997
01:35:14,680 --> 01:35:15,480
I hate this.

1998
01:35:15,680 --> 01:35:17,180
Oh, I hate this.

1999
01:35:17,400 --> 01:35:18,360
Okay, knock knock!

2000
01:35:19,240 --> 01:35:20,000
Apartment key.

2001
01:35:23,210 --> 01:35:24,670
I know you're here.

2002
01:35:24,790 --> 01:35:29,490
I know you're a freak and you're here right now waiting for me to go over here and it'll be like, peek-a-boo!

2003
01:35:30,810 --> 01:35:32,630
Don't think I don't know video games.

2004
01:35:33,190 --> 01:35:35,450
Don't think I don't know fucking video games.

2005
01:35:37,810 --> 01:35:39,910
You're gonna come up and be like, peek-a-boo!

2006
01:35:42,850 --> 01:35:43,290
Okay.

2007
01:35:43,290 --> 01:35:43,670
Okay.

2008
01:35:45,090 --> 01:35:45,970
Here I'll go.

2009
01:35:46,250 --> 01:35:47,170
Peek-a-boo time.

2010
01:35:48,550 --> 01:35:52,410
Sorry, my head, my fucking John-ass dog head is in the way.

2011
01:35:56,780 --> 01:35:57,400
Is it?

2012
01:35:59,380 --> 01:36:01,600
The fuck was my- oh no, that's not it.

2013
01:36:01,660 --> 01:36:02,260
That's not it.

2014
01:36:03,680 --> 01:36:05,200
The peek-a-boo is coming.

2015
01:36:05,280 --> 01:36:06,680
I can feel the peek-a-boo.

2016
01:36:06,980 --> 01:36:09,240
I can feel the peek-a-boo hours.

2017
01:36:11,100 --> 01:36:11,540
Okay.

2018
01:36:13,240 --> 01:36:14,980
I'm ready to be peek-a-booed.

2019
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:16,120
Run!

2020
01:36:16,920 --> 01:36:17,920
Where is it?

2021
01:36:22,400 --> 01:36:23,260
Peek-a-boo?

2022
01:36:26,710 --> 01:36:27,990
Peek-a-boo hours?

2023
01:36:30,270 --> 01:36:32,410
Oh my god, this is way too quiet.

2024
01:36:33,390 --> 01:36:34,350
He's waiting.

2025
01:36:34,570 --> 01:36:36,490
He's definitely waiting for me.

2026
01:36:37,650 --> 01:36:38,630
The fuck?

2027
01:36:43,590 --> 01:36:44,230
Okay.

2028
01:36:47,810 --> 01:36:48,770
Up I go.

2029
01:36:52,300 --> 01:36:53,260
Jesus Christ.

2030
01:36:53,540 --> 01:36:54,880
This fucking bitch.

2031
01:36:56,440 --> 01:36:56,920
Alright.

2032
01:36:57,280 --> 01:36:58,740
Up the window I go.

2033
01:37:01,940 --> 01:37:03,140
I hate this.

2034
01:37:03,200 --> 01:37:04,760
I already hate this game so much.

2035
01:37:08,820 --> 01:37:10,840
And then she came and washed it all away.

2036
01:37:10,860 --> 01:37:12,160
It all started to make sense now.

2037
01:37:12,260 --> 01:37:14,380
Not that it's a bad game, just that I'm scared.

2038
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:18,520
It's doing what it's good at doing.

2039
01:37:21,440 --> 01:37:23,120
It's doing what it's doing.

2040
01:37:24,240 --> 01:37:24,820
It's doing what it's doing.

2041
01:37:24,820 --> 01:37:26,320
It's just this place I can't fight it.

2042
01:37:26,380 --> 01:37:27,860
Gotta get my head straight.

2043
01:37:27,960 --> 01:37:29,900
Quick stop at Texan and then we're going.

2044
01:37:30,120 --> 01:37:31,040
Yes I'm fucking scared.

2045
01:37:31,100 --> 01:37:31,640
Yes I am.

2046
01:37:32,340 --> 01:37:34,440
I fucking hate horror games.

2047
01:37:34,640 --> 01:37:37,600
But like I promised you guys I would play Silent Hill 2.

2048
01:37:38,140 --> 01:37:39,380
And here it is.

2049
01:37:39,460 --> 01:37:40,920
They remade Silent Hill 2.

2050
01:37:41,220 --> 01:37:43,020
But like Oh my god.

2051
01:37:44,780 --> 01:37:47,380
Why is there three fucking doorways?

2052
01:37:50,060 --> 01:37:50,660
Guys.

2053
01:37:50,660 --> 01:37:50,680
Oh.

2054
01:37:54,400 --> 01:37:55,620
Oh there's a hole.

2055
01:37:56,300 --> 01:37:58,060
Fucking let me look through this.

2056
01:37:59,420 --> 01:38:00,020
Guys.

2057
01:38:00,720 --> 01:38:01,740
There's a hole.

2058
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:03,600
Surely.

2059
01:38:03,780 --> 01:38:05,840
Oh let me put my hands through there.

2060
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:11,180
Let me put my hands.

2061
01:38:11,560 --> 01:38:11,980
Wow.

2062
01:38:14,720 --> 01:38:15,620
Holy shit.

2063
01:38:16,620 --> 01:38:17,360
Holy shit.

2064
01:38:17,380 --> 01:38:21,920
Guys if I If I put my hands through the hole.

2065
01:38:22,940 --> 01:38:23,500
No.

2066
01:38:24,620 --> 01:38:25,180
Okay.

2067
01:38:25,400 --> 01:38:25,960
Okay.

2068
01:38:26,760 --> 01:38:27,320
No.

2069
01:38:28,280 --> 01:38:35,080
Would I have to file a harassment claim with HR if I put my hands through the hole?

2070
01:38:35,620 --> 01:38:37,080
Don't do it.

2071
01:38:37,160 --> 01:38:39,460
That's the James I remember.

2072
01:38:41,380 --> 01:38:42,400
Oh my god.

2073
01:38:42,440 --> 01:38:44,000
Papa Smirt thank you for the super chat.

2074
01:38:44,120 --> 01:38:44,500
Thank you.

2075
01:38:44,520 --> 01:38:45,200
Thank you.

2076
01:38:45,200 --> 01:38:45,280
Thank you.

2077
01:38:47,880 --> 01:38:49,100
Don't you refuse to run.

2078
01:38:49,140 --> 01:38:50,380
Get scratched while scrolling.

2079
01:38:50,580 --> 01:38:53,220
Go on a rampage and kill them all while screaming.

2080
01:38:53,640 --> 01:38:56,420
You have found the hole James.

2081
01:38:57,460 --> 01:38:58,880
I don't know now.

2082
01:38:59,040 --> 01:38:59,660
I don't know yet.

2083
01:38:59,800 --> 01:39:02,920
There's actually Guys I feel like this is a bad hole.

2084
01:39:03,820 --> 01:39:04,340
Yes.

2085
01:39:04,460 --> 01:39:06,120
I feel like I don't.

2086
01:39:06,160 --> 01:39:07,820
It's a bad hole.

2087
01:39:08,060 --> 01:39:08,580
Yes.

2088
01:39:09,120 --> 01:39:15,180
I I Open the door first.

2089
01:39:15,580 --> 01:39:17,560
What if it's a bad hole?

2090
01:39:25,240 --> 01:39:28,260
Alright for content I'll Alright.

2091
01:39:29,260 --> 01:39:32,960
James being a coward is not you.

2092
01:39:38,240 --> 01:39:40,300
Was this a bad hole?

2093
01:39:45,110 --> 01:39:46,650
Hey no it's fine.

2094
01:39:46,910 --> 01:39:48,750
Hey look at that.

2095
01:39:49,370 --> 01:39:51,090
It's covered in blood.

2096
01:39:54,950 --> 01:39:56,270
Look at that.

2097
01:39:56,850 --> 01:39:58,750
We won't fuck off.

2098
01:39:59,010 --> 01:40:02,230
We won't try and figure out where that blood came from.

2099
01:40:02,710 --> 01:40:03,390
Alright.

2100
01:40:04,790 --> 01:40:05,890
Look at that.

2101
01:40:07,330 --> 01:40:08,010
Okay.

2102
01:40:08,610 --> 01:40:11,390
We won't try and figure out where that came from guys.

2103
01:40:13,330 --> 01:40:14,730
It's fine right?

2104
01:40:16,070 --> 01:40:16,670
Alright.

2105
01:40:16,810 --> 01:40:18,430
Don't have to file a claim.

2106
01:40:20,350 --> 01:40:23,710
And now we see what's in the hole.

2107
01:40:25,290 --> 01:40:26,330
What's in the door?

2108
01:40:26,650 --> 01:40:28,290
What did my hand touch?

2109
01:40:33,930 --> 01:40:35,870
What did my hand touch?

2110
01:40:36,730 --> 01:40:38,370
I guess we'll never know.

2111
01:40:39,410 --> 01:40:42,830
I guess we'll never know what my hand touched.

2112
01:40:44,010 --> 01:40:51,550
I guess we'll never know what my hand touched.

2113
01:40:51,550 --> 01:40:52,970
And we'll never know.

2114
01:40:56,830 --> 01:40:57,390
Alright.

2115
01:40:57,710 --> 01:40:58,110
Oh hey.

2116
01:40:58,830 --> 01:40:59,990
Is there anything here?

2117
01:41:02,590 --> 01:41:05,010
I feel like I can go down from here.

2118
01:41:05,210 --> 01:41:07,250
But then there's a door here so I don't know.

2119
01:41:11,410 --> 01:41:11,970
Oh.

2120
01:41:15,330 --> 01:41:17,430
Okay, I guess we're not going that way.

2121
01:41:17,950 --> 01:41:20,610
Why give me a door if I can't go down?

2122
01:41:20,910 --> 01:41:22,010
Like, what?

2123
01:41:23,350 --> 01:41:25,490
What's the point of giving me that door?

2124
01:41:32,860 --> 01:41:33,600
Where am I?

2125
01:41:35,100 --> 01:41:36,480
This got pranked.

2126
01:41:43,650 --> 01:41:45,150
Quite literally the troll.

2127
01:41:45,250 --> 01:41:46,210
Okay, where do I go?

2128
01:41:46,310 --> 01:41:47,090
I'm here now.

2129
01:41:47,470 --> 01:41:48,810
We just gotta go to the bar.

2130
01:41:50,610 --> 01:41:51,830
Alright, I think it's this way.

2131
01:41:51,870 --> 01:41:54,370
I hope this pauses the game when I'm in the map.

2132
01:41:54,770 --> 01:41:58,610
I swear to god, if I get slapped by these fuckers...

2133
01:41:58,610 --> 01:42:02,250
or my fucking perversions...

2134
01:42:03,530 --> 01:42:10,670
I swear to god if I get slapped by these guys while I'm in my map form because I'm always opening the map and trying to figure out where the fuck I am.

2135
01:42:13,430 --> 01:42:14,930
It doesn't pause it?

2136
01:42:15,030 --> 01:42:15,350
Okay.

2137
01:42:15,630 --> 01:42:16,550
It does not?

2138
01:42:16,630 --> 01:42:16,930
Alright.

2139
01:42:18,430 --> 01:42:18,870
Alright.

2140
01:42:18,870 --> 01:42:20,090
This is great to know.

2141
01:42:21,290 --> 01:42:22,170
Okay, let's...

2142
01:42:22,170 --> 01:42:22,970
Oh.

2143
01:42:23,190 --> 01:42:23,930
Can I just?

2144
01:42:23,990 --> 01:42:24,350
Oh, I can.

2145
01:42:24,470 --> 01:42:25,810
I have to combine it in my inventory.

2146
01:42:26,070 --> 01:42:26,250
Whoops.

2147
01:42:27,090 --> 01:42:27,530
Alright.

2148
01:42:31,030 --> 01:42:31,470
Combine.

2149
01:42:32,270 --> 01:42:33,030
Here we go.

2150
01:42:34,130 --> 01:42:35,110
I fixed it.

2151
01:42:35,230 --> 01:42:36,030
With glue.

2152
01:42:36,890 --> 01:42:37,430
Let's go.

2153
01:42:48,710 --> 01:42:52,030
It's crazy that people found out already that this does not pause the game.

2154
01:42:55,800 --> 01:42:56,240
Alright.

2155
01:42:58,780 --> 01:42:59,780
I have...

2156
01:43:01,020 --> 01:43:01,660
What?

2157
01:43:07,700 --> 01:43:08,700
I don't...

2158
01:43:08,700 --> 01:43:10,700
Where's the money?

2159
01:43:10,940 --> 01:43:12,060
Where was it?

2160
01:43:14,300 --> 01:43:16,060
Where the fuck was the money?

2161
01:43:26,820 --> 01:43:30,080
I didn't know there was money I need to find?

2162
01:43:31,080 --> 01:43:32,720
Oh my god.

2163
01:43:33,180 --> 01:43:34,820
Oh my god.

2164
01:43:34,900 --> 01:43:35,940
Where the fu...

2165
01:43:35,940 --> 01:43:37,440
Oh my god.

2166
01:43:37,480 --> 01:43:38,760
I have to go find money?

2167
01:43:39,060 --> 01:43:39,700
Okay.

2168
01:43:39,700 --> 01:43:39,900
Okay.

2169
01:43:40,040 --> 01:43:42,040
I'm gonna save and then...

2170
01:43:42,500 --> 01:43:45,040
Oh my god.

2171
01:43:45,080 --> 01:43:46,880
I can't believe I'm fucking broke.

2172
01:43:47,120 --> 01:43:48,760
I have nothing in my life.

2173
01:43:48,940 --> 01:43:50,980
Like, what else does it want to take from me?

2174
01:43:51,380 --> 01:43:51,800
Like...

2175
01:43:54,680 --> 01:43:56,120
The crawl space?

2176
01:43:56,520 --> 01:43:56,700
What?

2177
01:43:56,820 --> 01:44:00,680
You mean like the little area in the... back to the...

2178
01:44:01,980 --> 01:44:03,080
The fuck?

2179
01:44:05,880 --> 01:44:07,180
Put it in C minor?

2180
01:44:11,340 --> 01:44:12,680
What's C minor?

2181
01:44:12,840 --> 01:44:13,120
This?

2182
01:44:14,660 --> 01:44:16,100
Guys, it doesn't matter.

2183
01:44:16,180 --> 01:44:16,980
I'm fucking broke.

2184
01:44:17,060 --> 01:44:18,780
I can't put anything in there.

2185
01:44:19,400 --> 01:44:21,160
I can't even pay...

2186
01:44:21,160 --> 01:44:21,380
Oh, bro.

2187
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:22,480
Wait.

2188
01:44:25,980 --> 01:44:29,620
I can't even play the fucking jukebox.

2189
01:44:30,060 --> 01:44:31,520
Because I'm broke.

2190
01:44:33,820 --> 01:44:34,540
Wait.

2191
01:44:34,720 --> 01:44:35,840
I'm so...

2192
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:37,040
I'm so...

2193
01:44:37,040 --> 01:44:39,180
I'm so fucking...

2194
01:44:39,180 --> 01:44:40,440
I'm so...

2195
01:44:40,440 --> 01:44:40,800
I'm gonna...

2196
01:44:40,800 --> 01:44:42,880
I'm gonna fucking freak out right here.

2197
01:44:47,180 --> 01:44:48,340
Holy shit.

2198
01:44:49,180 --> 01:44:49,760
Okay.

2199
01:44:49,880 --> 01:44:50,320
We're gonna...

2200
01:44:50,320 --> 01:44:52,900
We're gonna figure out where the fuck the coin is.

2201
01:44:52,920 --> 01:44:54,980
Where in the fuck is the coin?

2202
01:44:55,900 --> 01:44:56,980
That's gonna...

2203
01:44:56,980 --> 01:44:59,000
Where the fuck is the coin?

2204
01:45:00,020 --> 01:45:02,480
Is it in the goddamn cafe?

2205
01:45:03,320 --> 01:45:03,900
I...

2206
01:45:03,900 --> 01:45:04,280
Oh!

2207
01:45:04,280 --> 01:45:10,940
Oh my god.

2208
01:45:13,080 --> 01:45:13,980
Oh my god.

2209
01:45:13,980 --> 01:45:17,880
I have to go to the cafe to get the coin and then...

2210
01:45:18,880 --> 01:45:20,940
After I get the coin...

2211
01:45:20,940 --> 01:45:21,640
Okay.

2212
01:45:21,880 --> 01:45:22,520
All right.

2213
01:45:22,840 --> 01:45:23,560
All right.

2214
01:45:23,560 --> 01:45:25,160
I'm gonna save my game again.

2215
01:45:25,520 --> 01:45:26,020
Hey, guys.

2216
01:45:26,100 --> 01:45:27,360
Thank you for the super chat.

2217
01:45:27,420 --> 01:45:27,760
Thank you.

2218
01:45:27,800 --> 01:45:28,900
Thank you, Blackfire.

2219
01:45:29,100 --> 01:45:30,980
Thank you for the super chat.

2220
01:45:31,080 --> 01:45:31,480
Thank you.

2221
01:45:31,500 --> 01:45:32,180
Thank you.

2222
01:45:32,180 --> 01:45:33,120
You're so money.

2223
01:45:34,340 --> 01:45:38,400
Like, how did I even know that that's where the coin was?

2224
01:45:38,860 --> 01:45:39,980
I swear, if I can hit...

2225
01:45:39,980 --> 01:45:45,680
I swear to god if I can fucking hit, trying to figure out where the fuck this cafe is.

2226
01:45:45,800 --> 01:45:47,280
Oh, I'm gonna...

2227
01:45:50,140 --> 01:45:51,680
Oh, I'm gonna...

2228
01:45:51,680 --> 01:45:54,620
Oh, nothing's gonna stop this fucking beast.

2229
01:45:57,860 --> 01:45:59,120
Oh my god.

2230
01:45:59,220 --> 01:46:01,620
If I just hug this wall, it should be fine.

2231
01:46:01,720 --> 01:46:02,080
Okay.

2232
01:46:02,600 --> 01:46:03,100
Okay.

2233
01:46:04,980 --> 01:46:07,960
Okay, please leave me alone.

2234
01:46:09,080 --> 01:46:11,720
Please leave me alone.

2235
01:46:14,220 --> 01:46:16,440
Okay, this is the cafe.

2236
01:46:20,740 --> 01:46:23,540
Alright, there's like people here.

2237
01:46:31,060 --> 01:46:35,180
I swear to god, I swear to fucking god, stop.

2238
01:46:35,180 --> 01:46:36,980
Like, literally, stop.

2239
01:46:37,340 --> 01:46:39,300
Oh my god, stop.

2240
01:46:43,680 --> 01:46:45,800
Actually, no way!

2241
01:46:46,060 --> 01:46:49,020
No way it does that, you fucking...

2242
01:46:49,020 --> 01:46:49,880
Oh, freak!

2243
01:46:50,260 --> 01:46:52,520
Oh my god, no fucking way.

2244
01:46:52,640 --> 01:46:55,000
He projectile vomit?

2245
01:46:55,520 --> 01:47:00,400
He just had to projectile vomit on his dying breath?

2246
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:02,160
He just had to?

2247
01:47:02,380 --> 01:47:04,620
He literally...

2248
01:47:08,080 --> 01:47:09,140
Fuck you.

2249
01:47:12,380 --> 01:47:15,640
Are you fucking... oh my god!

2250
01:47:16,760 --> 01:47:18,400
I don't care.

2251
01:47:18,540 --> 01:47:20,080
I don't even care.

2252
01:47:20,220 --> 01:47:21,740
I don't even care.

2253
01:47:21,880 --> 01:47:23,060
Like, I'm already just...

2254
01:47:23,060 --> 01:47:25,140
You opened the door.

2255
01:47:27,820 --> 01:47:29,940
Oh my god.

2256
01:47:30,320 --> 01:47:31,040
Please!

2257
01:47:31,220 --> 01:47:33,480
I don't have the lottery.

2258
01:47:34,100 --> 01:47:34,460
Please!

2259
01:47:35,960 --> 01:47:36,620
Okay.

2260
01:47:38,700 --> 01:47:40,240
Oh, just why?

2261
01:47:40,600 --> 01:47:41,120
Why?

2262
01:47:42,240 --> 01:47:44,360
Why are you like this?

2263
01:47:45,080 --> 01:47:46,900
Why are you like this?

2264
01:47:47,280 --> 01:47:47,940
Why?

2265
01:47:48,080 --> 01:47:51,640
Why can't you think of something nicer, James?

2266
01:47:52,400 --> 01:47:54,240
Stop being sad!

2267
01:47:57,910 --> 01:47:58,240
Alright.

2268
01:48:00,320 --> 01:48:02,920
Alright, back to the bar we go.

2269
01:48:06,200 --> 01:48:09,600
I fucking hate these guys so much.

2270
01:48:10,200 --> 01:48:12,120
I've never hated a creature.

2271
01:48:13,680 --> 01:48:15,760
Why are you the way you are?

2272
01:48:17,880 --> 01:48:18,420
Why?

2273
01:48:18,480 --> 01:48:19,920
I... oh my god.

2274
01:48:20,100 --> 01:48:21,520
I... oh my god.

2275
01:48:21,540 --> 01:48:24,180
I swear to please let me go.

2276
01:48:24,420 --> 01:48:26,300
You don't even give me loot.

2277
01:48:29,560 --> 01:48:30,440
This is bad.

2278
01:48:30,540 --> 01:48:31,880
I shouldn't have looked at the map.

2279
01:48:32,140 --> 01:48:35,000
I shouldn't have looked at the map while this was all going.

2280
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:35,320
Oh my god.

2281
01:48:35,780 --> 01:48:38,100
They're fucking ankle biters too.

2282
01:48:39,060 --> 01:48:41,480
They're goddamn ankle biters.

2283
01:48:41,860 --> 01:48:43,940
I'm running as fast as I can.

2284
01:48:44,180 --> 01:48:45,780
James is a real person.

2285
01:48:45,820 --> 01:48:48,020
He doesn't have the stamina for this.

2286
01:48:48,900 --> 01:48:49,500
Okay.

2287
01:48:51,800 --> 01:48:54,960
Oh, this... all this for a goddamn quarter.

2288
01:48:56,200 --> 01:48:58,960
Okay, two and then...

2289
01:49:03,500 --> 01:49:04,920
Alright, here we go.

2290
01:49:09,080 --> 01:49:09,460
Is that it?

2291
01:49:20,740 --> 01:49:21,520
The fuck?

2292
01:49:23,820 --> 01:49:25,240
The fuck's my music?

2293
01:49:26,700 --> 01:49:27,940
Is that the music?

2294
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:28,920
Oh my god, James.

2295
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:30,280
I did all of that for this?

2296
01:49:34,390 --> 01:49:36,530
This track fucking sucks, James.

2297
01:49:41,230 --> 01:49:42,990
This is my jab.

2298
01:50:05,610 --> 01:50:06,990
He needs to move on.

2299
01:50:09,310 --> 01:50:12,110
This is really the reason he's in this mess because he couldn't move on.

2300
01:50:21,040 --> 01:50:22,560
Oh, I broke the...

2301
01:50:22,560 --> 01:50:23,700
Oh, I broke it again.

2302
01:50:23,860 --> 01:50:24,880
I just fixed this.

2303
01:50:25,340 --> 01:50:26,560
I just fixed this.

2304
01:50:26,940 --> 01:50:28,800
James, I fucking hate you so much.

2305
01:50:29,240 --> 01:50:31,840
I can't... no glue can fix this anymore.

2306
01:50:33,180 --> 01:50:35,040
No glue can fix that.

2307
01:50:39,600 --> 01:50:40,080
Alright.

2308
01:50:41,740 --> 01:50:49,840
As a fellow James, I learned that we love to vandalize all property, put hands in random holes, attend furry convention, is very aggressive, very broke, and very depressed.

2309
01:50:50,100 --> 01:50:51,060
Thank you for that.

2310
01:50:51,120 --> 01:50:53,460
Thank you for your very first super joke.

2311
01:50:53,460 --> 01:50:54,220
Thank you for your chest piece.

2312
01:50:54,460 --> 01:50:55,280
Thank you.

2313
01:50:55,420 --> 01:50:55,940
Thank you.

2314
01:50:56,180 --> 01:50:57,100
Oh my god.

2315
01:50:57,140 --> 01:50:58,720
Now we're in Kingdom Hearts territory.

2316
01:50:58,900 --> 01:51:00,280
Guys, I don't think I'm gonna...

2317
01:51:00,280 --> 01:51:01,520
Guys, I think I'm gonna...

2318
01:51:01,520 --> 01:51:05,860
I'm gonna softlock this game with the amount of heals I've used in the beginning.

2319
01:51:06,040 --> 01:51:07,820
I'm so gonna softlock.

2320
01:51:08,040 --> 01:51:09,080
There's no way.

2321
01:51:09,480 --> 01:51:10,980
There's no way.

2322
01:51:11,180 --> 01:51:16,160
I feel like I'm at softlock territory with the...

2323
01:51:16,160 --> 01:51:19,480
I already used up all my heals fucking doing this.

2324
01:51:19,700 --> 01:51:20,260
I...

2325
01:51:24,760 --> 01:51:26,220
Oh my god.

2326
01:51:27,460 --> 01:51:28,880
Oh my god.

2327
01:51:29,900 --> 01:51:31,900
Sounds like a you problem.

2328
01:51:33,880 --> 01:51:34,920
Alright, we're gonna...

2329
01:51:35,280 --> 01:51:36,640
We're gonna call it here, chat.

2330
01:51:36,780 --> 01:51:38,760
Like, I think two...

2331
01:51:38,760 --> 01:51:39,080
I know...

2332
01:51:39,080 --> 01:51:41,120
I'm sorry that I couldn't play longer, everybody.

2333
01:51:41,500 --> 01:51:44,100
But I am sick, so I'm gonna...

2334
01:51:44,100 --> 01:51:46,180
I'm gonna call it here, guys.

2335
01:51:47,560 --> 01:51:48,080
Um...

2336
01:51:48,080 --> 01:51:52,740
That was a fun two hours of Silent Hill 2 going in.

2337
01:51:53,380 --> 01:51:53,860
Um...

2338
01:51:53,860 --> 01:51:57,720
So we're gonna rest now and, like, focus on getting better.

2339
01:51:58,660 --> 01:51:59,820
So no stream tomorrow.

2340
01:52:00,040 --> 01:52:01,480
I don't know if I'll be streaming on Monday.

2341
01:52:01,700 --> 01:52:02,400
We'll see.

2342
01:52:02,600 --> 01:52:06,740
But I hope you guys enjoyed the sneak peek of the early access.

2343
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:08,160
I mean, it's been fun so far.

2344
01:52:08,240 --> 01:52:11,680
I feel like the remix seems pretty fun, uh, so far.

2345
01:52:12,480 --> 01:52:12,960
Um...

2346
01:52:12,960 --> 01:52:13,760
And, uh...

2347
01:52:14,520 --> 01:52:16,060
And I've been having a good time.

2348
01:52:16,160 --> 01:52:18,260
Other than the fact that I fucking hate...

2349
01:52:18,260 --> 01:52:19,240
I hate those...

2350
01:52:19,240 --> 01:52:20,840
I hate those guys so much.

2351
01:52:20,860 --> 01:52:21,460
Oh my god.

2352
01:52:21,460 --> 01:52:24,340
They're, like, the easiest enemies in the game, too.

2353
01:52:24,400 --> 01:52:25,320
That's the worst part.

2354
01:52:25,520 --> 01:52:31,700
When they're the fucking easiest enemies in the game and I'm having my ass kicked in right now.

2355
01:52:31,880 --> 01:52:32,360
I...

2356
01:52:33,700 --> 01:52:34,900
I'm so...

2357
01:52:34,900 --> 01:52:36,720
I'm so fucked now.

2358
01:52:36,800 --> 01:52:37,780
I'm so...

2359
01:52:37,780 --> 01:52:40,340
I just hope I don't softlock later.

2360
01:52:40,540 --> 01:52:43,240
I really hope I don't get softlocked.

2361
01:52:43,680 --> 01:52:44,280
Anyway...

2362
01:52:44,280 --> 01:52:44,920
Um...

2363
01:52:45,720 --> 01:52:47,140
As always, everybody...

2364
01:52:47,140 --> 01:52:47,840
I'm gonna...

2365
01:52:48,400 --> 01:52:49,500
I'm gonna rest my voice.

2366
01:52:49,920 --> 01:52:50,200
Um...

2367
01:52:50,200 --> 01:52:50,840
As always, everybody...

2368
01:52:50,840 --> 01:52:51,420
Stay hydrated.

2369
01:52:51,660 --> 01:52:52,260
Posture checked in.

2370
01:52:52,340 --> 01:52:53,540
Move around to get that blood flowing.

2371
01:52:53,640 --> 01:52:55,880
And if you stay up for me, head to bed.

2372
01:52:56,060 --> 01:52:56,420
Cause...

2373
01:52:56,420 --> 01:52:57,420
You deserve it.

2374
01:52:57,480 --> 01:52:58,660
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

2375
01:52:59,340 --> 01:53:00,040
Bye, guys.

2376
01:53:00,760 --> 01:53:01,120
Bye.

2377
01:53:02,100 --> 01:53:02,460
Bye.

2378
01:53:02,820 --> 01:53:03,180
Bye.

2379
01:53:03,780 --> 01:53:04,140
Bye.
