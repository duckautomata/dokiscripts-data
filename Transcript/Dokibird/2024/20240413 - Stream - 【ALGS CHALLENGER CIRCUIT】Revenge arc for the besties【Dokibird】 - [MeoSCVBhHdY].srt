Oh, my God.

61
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,120
This was Tempo's idea, too.

62
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,580
And he's not awake.

63
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,260
This guy's a fucking idiot, man.

64
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,260
If he's not awake, I will actually lose my mind on him.

65
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,160
Me too.

66
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:21,300
Because he's the one that's so excited about it every time.

67
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:21,620
Yeah.

68
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:27,000
He's the one that's like, yeah, he's the one that's gassing
it up every week.

69
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:29,760
If he fell back to sleep, I'm never doing this thing again.

70
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:44,360
There's no shot There's no fucking way I can't believe I
think he actually is asleep Why would he not be online?

71
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:52,680
No, I refuse to be there We can't get a sub because we
didn't even sign up Anyone to substitute No, he has to be

00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:58,680
awake He has to be awake, yes, no I'm not playing this as a

Get on your PC.

144
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,140
What are you doing on your phone?

145

00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:44,500
Oh, I was like, I thought he was on his phone.

00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:04,260
TSM We should actually do TSM after this.

191
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:12,640
It'll be funny We should be TSM every time TSM CC Make them
a fake name like we're TSM white.

192
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:16,600
Oh Wait, that's such a good idea.

193
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:17,100
People are like bro.

194
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,020
Are they actually son of TSM?

195
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:18,440
We just died.

00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:21,700
Yes, we just died now.

197
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,260
Yeah, that's us.

198
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:23,480
We're too.

199
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,120
We should change.

200
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:26,500
We should make a club Wait, are you guys on clans right now?

201
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:27,840
Are you guys in any clans?

202

How do you join a clan?

203
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,060
The fucking groups were the calls.

204
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:33,520
Yeah.

205
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,020
Didn't they get rid of some club?

206
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,120
Should we do a TSM club?

207
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:37,920
Yeah, yeah, we should do a TSM club.

208
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:38,580
Did they get rid of clubs?

209
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:39,640
Wait, no they didn't.

210
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,540
Why would they get rid of the best thing ever?

211
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,680
You got rid of clubs.

212
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,860
When did it- The best thing ever, that shit sucked.

213
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,520
It was so useless.

214
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,880
Yeah, but what the fuck, it's not useless to me.

215
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,120
It is.

216
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,760
It's overall just useless in general.

217
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,600
It's not useless to me.

218
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,040
My opinion is matter.

219
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,600
Do they actually?

220
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,980

221
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:01,620
Yeah.

222
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:02,900

We did not do that.

227
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:09,500
No, I can't do that now.

00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,720
You can't do any shit on steam though.

231
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:21,800

257
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:16,920
don't run at teams just to just to gauge how it's gonna be
like and then after we figure out the skill level we can

258
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:24,720
decide if we're gonna be little rats or if we're gonna be
you know on gaming i mean listen i'm down i mean listen okay

It's already better than last week.

265
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,440
Yeah, that's already better.

266
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,320
Yeah, I didn't do any of those things.

267
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:05,320
I barely shot my gun.

268
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,820
To be fair, I went a lot of close range.

269
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,980
I did a lot of close range guns.

270
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:15,820
Because I assume we'd be fighting more instead of, you know.

271
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,880
You think we're going to fight more?

272
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:18,300
I don't know.

273
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:22,200
I was told that round one would be so easy.

274
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:25,720
And then so I thought that I'll be fighting more, you know.

275
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,080
Well, that's the problem here, though.

276
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,480
That's the problem is that it is easy.

277
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,740
It's just not really for us.

278
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:37,220
you know yeah apparently it is the easiest round but there
is no easy round for us guys we're facing adversity every

279
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:44,680
step of the way like every step for you it's an uphill
battle every every round for us no matter what that's like a

280
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:57,260
little unfortunate not gonna lie that's a little sad i love
that though dokey get in wait we have the code oh yeah code

00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,080
We're locked.

284
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:01,500
It's all right.

285
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:01,900

That's true.

298
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:17,240
Remember, if we win our control game, it means we win.

299
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,620
Guys, we have to win at least one game today.

Wait, wait.

00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:15,520
Why does it look like there's two teams right beside us?

I don't know.

376
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:17,560
On our right side.

00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,400
No, we're good.

378
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:18,580

379
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:19,160
They're not coming here.

380
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:19,820

00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:23,960
Go left.

387
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,520
Exactly what Evan taught me.

388
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:29,720
All right.

389
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,340
I blame him.

00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:30,520
We're good.

391
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:31,000
There's no one here.

392
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:31,360
There's no here.

395
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,160

solution there's only one team at stacks right now yeah i

442
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:20,340

Yeah, and you scan?

452

You're going to scan?

00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:40,440
Where are you going?

455
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:41,720
I can't scan when I'm in the air.

456
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:42,720
What do you mean?

457
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,480

I was scared.

459
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,020
I didn't want to have cover.

460
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:49,380
Very good.

461
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,620
I was so scared.

462
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:51,820
Oh, God, I'm very bad.

463
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:52,220

Oh, nice slide.

468
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:57,520
Okay, we don't need a way for him.

469
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,500
Are we grabbing like this thingy?

470
00:25:59,700 --> 00:25:59,720

Just come here.

473
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:05,040
And then we'll grab it if we're like able to.

474
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,500
Oh, look, people.

475
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:08,620
They're going mod, which I don't agree with.

Oh, yeah.

479
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,180
We can scan the people beacon and I can scan the beacon
beacon.

480
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,360
I don't know if it's safe to scan.

481
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:17,740
Is it safe to scan?

482
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:21,840
Yo, someone else landed.

483
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,780
Oh, they're in the other way.

484
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:24,460
I'm scanning.

485
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:25,820
We're good.

486
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,000

487
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:27,440
Okay, okay.

488
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,980
We just played from here, I think.

489
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:31,000
I don't know if it's going to pull back side, but I'd rather

00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,560
I'm just going to look everywhere, to be honest.

494
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:37,260
I have a long bow.

495
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:37,860
Let's get some shots.

496
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:40,680
We're brewing, like, I hope they don't shoot me in the back.

497
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:41,680
You guys need bats?

498
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:42,100
Awkward.

499
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:44,120
I do.

500
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:44,660
I'm zero.

501
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:45,200
I'm zero.

502
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:45,720
I'm just two.

503
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:46,440
Yeah, take that other one.

504
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:47,660
Let's tell what he's all of them.

505
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:48,380
No, no, no.

506
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:50,780
I don't have, if you guys find more steel cells, let me
know.

507
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:51,960
I only have like five.

508
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:52,340
Oh, I got you.

509
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:53,440
I can give you some for sure.

510
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:54,160
I'm just going to get more ammo.

511
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:56,100
Oh, they're going to fucking take your shit.

512
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:57,440
I dropped four down here.

513
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:57,980
Why don't they get them?

514
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,040
The blowbow doesn't grab them.

515
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:00,860
I don't think they will.

516
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:01,400
I don't think they will.

517
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:04,340
Oh, if they grab it, we run at them.

518
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:05,140
Yeah, I agree.

519
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:07,320
OK, that sounds like a terrible idea.

520
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:08,180
That's a great idea.

521
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:08,700
I'm down.

522
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:09,440
Fuck those guys.

523
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,320
They kick my loot, bro.

524
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:11,160
We get after it.

525
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:13,780
I hate motherfuckers who steal loot.

526
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:15,840
I'm taking a hundred shots of a longbow here.

527
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,160
I steal loot.

528
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:17,160
Do you hate me?

529
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,140
Yeah.

530
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:19,240
Wow.

531
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,420
No hesitation, yeah.

532
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:23,540
Very, very much.

533
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,220
Wait, wait, wait.

534
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,220
Try and grab the evo.

535
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,800
No one's going to kill you right now.

536
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,680
Yeah, yeah, try, try, try.

537
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:28,780
I bet you no one's going to kill you.

538
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:30,400
All right, if I die, let me know.

539
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,180
I bet you.

540
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:34,080

A whole one gifted sub that no one's going to kill you.

00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,960
And then if you live, you got to give me one sub.

546
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,340
How does that work?

547
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,160
Because it's a bet, you know?

548
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,360

00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,400

Oh, you're good.

704
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:20,780
He's a wraith.

705
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:21,680
Why isn't he queuing up?

706
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,080
The one I just cracked was a wraith, wasn't it?

707
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:26,300
Well, I mean, if he's not queuing up, I don't think it's a
wraith anymore.

708
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:27,800
If he's not queuing up.

709
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,640
Oh, he went up, he went up.

710
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,080
It wasn't a wraith.

711
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:30,800
There's a team.

712
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:31,320
Yeah, it was.

782
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:12,510
Good, Tom.

783
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:13,170
It's good for you.

784
00:42:13,870 --> 00:42:15,790
I look over and I'm like, what the fuck?

785
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:18,850
All right, what place we have?

786
00:42:18,910 --> 00:42:20,670
We're going to be in like, what, like ninth place now?

787
00:42:21,450 --> 00:42:22,010
That's mean.

788
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:29,190
All right, we got to make a new lobby, right?

789
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:30,390
Yeah, there's video code.

790
00:42:30,490 --> 00:42:31,130
Yeah, yeah, most likely.

791
00:42:31,490 --> 00:42:32,090
Yeah, it's snowing.

792
00:42:32,170 --> 00:42:33,250
All right.

793
00:42:34,930 --> 00:42:35,990
Oh, wow.

794
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:39,050
Fuck me, man.

795
00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:40,570
What's wrong?

796
00:42:40,610 --> 00:42:42,050
I can't believe I've got three man shantons.

797
00:42:42,330 --> 00:42:42,810
It's all right.

798
00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:46,310
It's because it's because someone didn't change their name.

799
00:42:48,130 --> 00:42:49,950
Well, honestly, it's probably the longbow charge label.

800
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:52,590
That's a clear indicator.

801
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:53,270
All right.

802
00:42:53,430 --> 00:42:54,510
We're in seven.

803
00:42:55,810 --> 00:43:00,370
All I'm saying is if somebody changed their name.

804
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:04,250
I don't know.

805
00:43:04,770 --> 00:43:05,710
My god.

806
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:09,230
Maybe I should have made a just nice rigged thief.

807
00:43:09,430 --> 00:43:10,510
You know, seven plays.

808
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:12,570
We just need to have good consistent games.

809
00:43:13,010 --> 00:43:17,310
It would be so sad if this is the fucking week we get
knocked out first round.

810
00:43:17,790 --> 00:43:19,950
And we get the easiest.

811
00:43:20,430 --> 00:43:21,270
Oh, they imagine.

812
00:43:22,170 --> 00:43:22,570
Jesus.

813
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:26,070
First round would be really bad.

814
00:43:26,390 --> 00:43:28,930
Technically, this is like better.

815
00:43:29,850 --> 00:43:32,150
Technically, this is supposed to be easier.

816
00:43:32,170 --> 00:43:39,130
year for us to see no no first round is harder for us round
two is gonna be the easiest round three yeah yeah round

817
00:43:39,130 --> 00:43:45,790
three will be around two will be normal so yeah i meant like
i meant like for this this this this round one should be

818
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:56,910
easier than last week's round one so it'll be very fucking
awkward if you know we did not make it through yeah that'll

819
00:43:56,910 --> 00:44:07,010
be so awkward we are in oh awkward we're in seven seven oh
yeah yeah all right we're fine yeah we're so good guys

820
00:44:07,010 --> 00:44:13,530
literally we have to like actually be the worst to knock
wall and like no offense like we're bad we're not what if

821
00:44:13,530 --> 00:44:26,430
what if 11 12 and 13 are watching your stream right now huh
yeah yeah we got a lot of work somebody okay 11 12th and

822
00:44:26,430 --> 00:44:32,490
13th place are watching your stream and they just feel sad

How's that confidence up?

838
00:46:02,530 --> 00:46:03,470
You little shithead?

839
00:46:07,070 --> 00:46:09,370
Too bad you don't have a chat to the fact checkers.

840
00:46:10,670 --> 00:46:11,170
Not now.

841
00:46:11,230 --> 00:46:11,710
Not now.

842
00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:12,730
In 10 minutes, I will.

843
00:46:12,810 --> 00:46:14,310
You can wait 10 minutes for it.

844
00:46:14,390 --> 00:46:15,110
Yeah, in 10 minutes.

845
00:46:15,330 --> 00:46:18,310
But you don't even know where that's supposed to be about.

846
00:46:19,410 --> 00:46:20,810
Wiggin' tempo is so serious.

847
00:46:20,950 --> 00:46:22,090
Doki shoots in the air.

848
00:46:22,270 --> 00:46:22,770
Cracked four.

849
00:46:23,610 --> 00:46:24,010
What?

850
00:46:24,530 --> 00:46:24,930
What?

851
00:46:26,490 --> 00:46:30,050
She missed like 75 shots and she's like cracked three.

852
00:46:30,630 --> 00:46:31,810
Oh my god.

853
00:46:32,510 --> 00:46:33,770
I watched the team she was shooting.

854
00:46:34,010 --> 00:46:35,870
I was hitting them and she hit zero shots.

855
00:46:38,230 --> 00:46:40,550
I watched it all happen in front of me, dude.

856
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:43,990
I know, no, no, they were, it was cracked.

857
00:46:44,170 --> 00:46:45,190
You know that.

858
00:46:46,110 --> 00:46:49,030
You don't have the POV on my screen.

859
00:46:49,670 --> 00:46:50,610
Yeah, I'll get it in 10 minutes.

860
00:46:50,910 --> 00:46:51,990
10 minutes.

861
00:46:52,510 --> 00:46:54,350
I'm pretty sure jokes on you.

862
00:46:54,390 --> 00:46:55,730
There's no rewind on my screen.

863
00:46:55,750 --> 00:47:06,250

00:47:13,570 --> 00:47:22,650

i did not know there was a zip there i'm gonna be honest bro

866
00:47:22,650 --> 00:47:25,410
i knew the zip was there but I just had no idea they're the
floor underneath us.

867
00:47:25,410 --> 00:47:26,030
That's my bad.

868
00:47:26,170 --> 00:47:27,370
I didn't know that either.

869
00:47:28,630 --> 00:47:29,910
You're the bloodhound man.

870
00:47:30,170 --> 00:47:31,870
I didn't scan there.

871
00:47:32,190 --> 00:47:33,110
I didn't know.

872
00:47:33,890 --> 00:47:35,250
I didn't have my scan.

873
00:47:35,870 --> 00:47:37,870
Bro, we should have, like, those tag names.

874
00:47:38,010 --> 00:47:39,870
You see those people at the AES9?

875
00:47:40,750 --> 00:47:41,570
You know, do you see those?

876
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:42,330
Oh, my God.

877
00:47:42,870 --> 00:47:43,490
Before, let's do that.

878
00:47:43,790 --> 00:47:47,010
For the third game, let's all change our name to TSM
underscore.

879
00:47:47,010 --> 00:47:47,410
Oh, my God.

880
00:47:47,410 --> 00:47:48,070
It's so funny.

881
00:47:48,410 --> 00:47:48,570
It's so funny.

882
00:47:48,890 --> 00:47:52,710
And then people are like, people on the competitive, like,
apex, right?

883
00:47:53,430 --> 00:47:54,010
That's great.

884
00:47:54,170 --> 00:47:55,550
We got signed to TSN.

885
00:47:55,990 --> 00:47:59,830
Wait, did you see the post about us like a couple weeks ago
when we first announced it?

886
00:48:00,150 --> 00:48:01,930
They were like, this team's going to do awful.

887
00:48:03,350 --> 00:48:06,750
If you all thought we were playing like these serious
styles, like dude, there's no way people think we're

888
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:07,190
serious.

889
00:48:07,270 --> 00:48:08,910
Dude, what the fuck?

890
00:48:09,270 --> 00:48:11,310
I mean, who's going to, they're like, who's going to IGL?

891
00:48:11,490 --> 00:48:13,130
Like, I understand how this team thinks they're going to do
well.

892
00:48:13,290 --> 00:48:14,710
I'm like, bro, why are they participating?

893
00:48:14,790 --> 00:48:15,650
They're not going to win.

894
00:48:15,810 --> 00:48:16,390
They're going to throw it.

895
00:48:16,890 --> 00:48:22,750
I remember I saw someone tweeted something like, these
people are making fun of the competitive integrity of TSN.

896
00:48:23,410 --> 00:48:27,670
Yeah, we are yes, we are They're not gonna take it
seriously.

897
00:48:28,010 --> 00:48:29,350
Why are they joining the CC?

898
00:48:30,210 --> 00:48:33,450
Yeah, that just proves that if we do better than you then
what the fuck?

899
00:48:33,630 --> 00:48:34,830
What are you doing?

900
00:48:35,410 --> 00:48:37,330
Yeah, what the fuck are you doing?

901
00:48:38,470 --> 00:48:39,050
That's what I'm saying.

902
00:48:39,570 --> 00:48:44,350
Yeah, the last time I touched a- okay, that's- I know I
played Apex yesterday.

903
00:48:44,710 --> 00:48:49,930
The last time I touched Apex competitive was the last- You

904
00:48:50,390 --> 00:48:50,670

No, no, I actually didn't see those people.

00:49:38,090 --> 00:49:39,170
I really got to watch her back.

917
00:49:39,510 --> 00:49:40,510
Look at my POV.

918
00:49:40,810 --> 00:49:44,230

Uh, here's a 3x if anyone needs it.

928
00:50:32,670 --> 00:50:33,890
I'll actually take that.

929
00:50:34,850 --> 00:50:35,510
We won't take it over.

930
00:50:35,610 --> 00:50:36,210
Where's the zone now?

931
00:50:36,430 --> 00:50:37,110
Let's see.

932
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:44,220
Anyone finds a vault and not use it?

933
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:44,980
Let me know.

934
00:50:47,260 --> 00:50:49,300
There was a vault in my room somewhere.

935
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:51,480
Oh, I almost got run over by the...

936
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:52,960
Guys, I drank some coffee now.

937
00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:54,000
I'm so locked in.

938
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:56,500
My eyes are a little bit more open now.

939
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:01,860
Ooh, I got a blue helmet here for anybody.

940
00:51:02,620 --> 00:51:03,180
Oh, I was muted.

941
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:04,340
Anyone need a gold heavy mag?

942
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:05,400
Uh, yeah.

943
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:06,740
Me, me, me, me.

944
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:08,280
I'll bring it over to you.

945
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:09,300
Me, me, me, me, me.

946
00:51:09,620 --> 00:51:09,980
Backpack.

947
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:10,880
Backpack.

948
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:14,000
Oh, my God, there's another...

949
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:16,200
Is someone taking that gold energy mag or now?

950
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:16,940
If they are, it's dead.

951
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:18,420
Because I just found a ball.

952
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:18,940
Me, me, me, me, me.

953
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:22,020
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me.

954
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:25,260
Oh, nice.

955
00:51:26,340 --> 00:51:27,300
All right, where's the EVO cache?

956
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:29,260
I'll get the EVO cache just next to me.

957
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:29,980
Yeah, you're good.

958
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:32,440
And then I'll scan the people scanner.

959
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:33,620
There's a purple helmet.

960
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:34,420
Oh, here.

961
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:36,180
That'd be great.

962
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:36,980
Is that a charge rifle?

963
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:40,200
No, I haven't found a single charge rifle.

964
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:41,940
I haven't seen one either, buddy.

965
00:51:44,260 --> 00:51:45,520
I know it's tough for you out here, bud.

966
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:46,320
I know.

967
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:49,620
Where you can deal with your life when you don't have your
charge rifle.

968
00:51:50,620 --> 00:51:52,600
I have all the stuff for a charge rifle.

969
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:53,980
I just don't have the charge rifle.

970
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:57,440
Wait, I found it.

971
00:51:57,580 --> 00:51:58,240
Oh, nice.

972
00:51:58,620 --> 00:52:00,660
I'm trying to find him.

973
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:01,140
He found it.

974
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:04,200
Um, okay.

975
00:52:04,340 --> 00:52:05,920
That's gonna be a Skyhook zone for sure, obviously.

976
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:09,800
I think it's gonna pull probably towards like the back of
Skyhook around that area.

977
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:11,720
We had zero kills last game?

978
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:12,440
Yeah.

979
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:13,220
Seven, seven, seven.

980
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:13,980
Seven plays though.

981
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:15,180
We had zero kills?

982
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:17,100
Oh, kill smells.

983
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:17,580
Don't even matter.

984
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:18,040
Oh my God.

985
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:21,660
I cracked all those people just for zero kills.

986
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:23,220
Just to get nothing out of this.

987
00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:27,480
Now, how would people know I actually cracked them if you
guys didn't?

988
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:30,120
Yeah, I think that actually might be our fault.

989
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:33,560
Wait, I got a golden ball here.

990
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:35,380

00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:26,320
Oh, my God, bro.

1163
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:27,760
Their setup is crazy scary.

1164
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:30,580
They're diabolical over there.

1165
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:33,780
I can only shoot this team now because the other team has a
bloody rampart.

1166
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:35,680
Yeah, I'm scared of that team.

1167
00:58:35,820 --> 00:58:36,600
Not going to lie.

1168
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:38,940
Yeah, it's like a team that we can't even do anything
against.

1169
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:39,280
Yeah.

1170
00:58:40,220 --> 00:58:40,920
I'm scared.

1171
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:43,360
I don't even want to fucking peek that shit.

1172
00:58:43,580 --> 00:58:44,940
Does someone want my charge rifle after?

1173
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:45,420
Oh, nope.

1174
00:58:45,620 --> 00:58:46,200
I already got purple.

1175
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:47,420
Graber over there?

1176
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:48,300
Can I get that, Graber?

1177
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:51,320
That's really far.

1178
00:58:51,980 --> 00:58:53,540
That's really close to this team.

1179
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:55,420
I know, but fuck me.

1180
00:58:55,900 --> 00:58:56,320
Do it.

1181
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:57,600
No, I can't.

1182
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:57,900
Do it.

1183
00:58:58,340 --> 00:59:00,060
If I die, then we are so fucked.

1184
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:00,920
Okay, yeah, don't do it.

1185
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:01,680
Don't do it.

1186
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:03,400
No, respond.

1187
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:04,960
I mean, you can get the beacon, but you can't.

1188
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:05,900
You can't have a banner though.

1189
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:07,500
It's just chalked.

1190
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:09,120
Shoot, fuck off, charge rifle guy.

1191
00:59:10,140 --> 00:59:12,520
I'm just gonna hang out here.

1192
00:59:13,860 --> 00:59:14,800
I have a 55.

1193
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:16,860
I got my purple up now too, which is good.

1194
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:18,980
How did you get your purple?

1195
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:21,860
I scanned a package and then I got a shot.

1196
00:59:22,620 --> 00:59:24,380
Oh, I need like 50 shots.

1197
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:30,540
I don't know who to shoot at because it's just that team and
then the team, the rampart team.

1198
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:33,400
There's like no one else for me to shoot at.

1199
00:59:33,580 --> 00:59:34,260
I'm gonna chug another.

1200
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:35,800
I'm gonna chug this coffee.

1201
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:37,880
I said that kid 106 and I knocked this kid?

1202
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:38,820
No, he's not picking me, bitch.

1203
00:59:40,260 --> 00:59:41,580
Oh, bitch.

1204
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:42,680
No.

1205
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:44,080
Okay.

1206
00:59:45,380 --> 00:59:48,540
Let's try and get this one shot in for that 50.

1207
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:50,320
Come on.

1208
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:51,160
Somebody peek.

1209
00:59:51,740 --> 00:59:52,960
Somebody open that door.

1210
00:59:54,860 --> 00:59:56,660
Just think about me for a sec, team.

1211
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:58,720
All right, let's see where the sound's going.

1212
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:02,000
All right, well, I think I kind of want to move right, but I
don't know.

1213
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:03,120
I think we just stay here for right now.

1214
01:00:04,220 --> 01:00:04,720
Oh, my God.

1215
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:05,800
I'm literally five.

1216
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:06,860
I'm five away.

1217
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:09,760
Is there any way to get under these guys on the roof?

1218
01:00:10,060 --> 01:00:10,600
In the middle?

1219
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:11,520
I don't think so, right?

1220
01:00:11,540 --> 01:00:12,040
Under these?

1221
01:00:12,260 --> 01:00:13,100
Oh, in the middle.

1222
01:00:13,580 --> 01:00:13,780
Yeah.

1223
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:16,320
Without dying, I don't know if we could right now.

1224
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:18,680
It may be could, honestly.

1225
01:00:19,020 --> 01:00:19,560
It just depends.

1226
01:00:19,780 --> 01:00:21,400
I just have no... We have no smokes, which sucks.

1227
01:00:21,940 --> 01:00:23,400
Yeah, we only have the scans.

1228
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:24,640
Yeah.

1229
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:25,660
And there's nobody.

1230
01:00:26,460 --> 01:00:27,300
There's no one on there?

1231
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:27,860
They left?

1232
01:00:28,260 --> 01:00:28,480
What?

1233
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:29,240
Which one?

1234
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:30,460
The middle.

1235
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:31,040
You scanned the middle.

1236
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:31,600
You didn't get anything.

1237
01:00:32,660 --> 01:00:33,640
No, they're there.

1238
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:33,840
They're there.

1239
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:34,260
I just didn't...

1240
01:00:34,260 --> 01:00:35,280
I'm going on a zip somewhere?

1241
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:36,260
I did not hit...

1242
01:00:36,260 --> 01:00:37,660
My rage wasn't in the middle.

1243
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:39,940
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1244
01:00:41,140 --> 01:00:41,760
It's okay.

1245
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:42,840
I'm going to use my bat.

1246
01:00:43,460 --> 01:00:45,360
I wasn't paying attention, but it's okay.

1247
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:46,380
I'm paying attention now.

1248
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:47,440
You're doing great.

1249
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:47,920
You're doing great.

1250
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:48,300
Thank you.

1251
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:52,360
See, positive reaffirmation improves the player.

1252
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:52,760
Yeah.

1253
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:53,700
Oh, you're so right.

1254
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:55,780
You should do that to me more often.

1255
01:00:56,180 --> 01:00:57,980
Well, like, it only works for certain players.

1256
01:00:58,360 --> 01:00:59,480
Oh, so I'm not one of those.

1257
01:01:01,180 --> 01:01:03,500
I do better if you have a sub through, actually.

1258
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:04,060
You're so right.

1259
01:01:05,780 --> 01:01:07,260
My role model.

1260
01:01:07,540 --> 01:01:16,580
It works for certain players If it works for, I don't know
if it works for TSM, who's the number one team?

1261
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:17,180
I don't know.

1262
01:01:20,020 --> 01:01:20,920
You're so right.

1263
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:25,940
Oh my god, stop looking at me through the rampart wall, you
freak.

1264
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:28,260
I need five damage.

1265
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:30,280
I'm gonna scan the top.

1266
01:01:30,580 --> 01:01:32,440
Yeah, see, they're still there.

1267
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:33,320
Yeah, they are.

1268
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:34,160
There's playing really weird.

1269
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:34,760
Oh, there's a pack.

1270
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:35,400
When he pops his head?

1271
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:38,080
I want to get this care pack in front of us.

1272
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:38,420
What is it?

1273
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:41,100
It's a fucking crazy.

1274
01:01:41,100 --> 01:01:42,540
I don't need to shoot any more!

1275
01:01:43,140 --> 01:01:43,280
Nice.

1276
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:43,700
I got you.

1277
01:01:43,860 --> 01:01:44,020
I got you.

1278
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:45,840
I kind of want to see how he's trying.

1279
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:46,400
How did you get purple?

1280
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:48,780
It's like he's scanning another package.

1281
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:50,660
I'm going to try to get this one.

1282
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:51,660
Let's see if I can do it.

1283
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:52,220
Oh.

1284
01:01:53,060 --> 01:01:54,340
It's going to be really risky actually.

1285
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:54,760
Bro.

1286
01:01:54,900 --> 01:01:55,780
Can you guys shoot this building?

1287
01:01:55,980 --> 01:01:56,220
Yeah.

1288
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:57,040
We're shooting.

1289
01:01:58,200 --> 01:01:59,160
We're looking at them.

1290
01:01:59,180 --> 01:02:01,040
Looking at them, but I don't see any of them.

1291
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:02,520
Yeah, they're not looking at us.

1292
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:03,940
I think they're here.

1293
01:02:04,020 --> 01:02:05,000
I think they're on this fence right now.

1294
01:02:05,060 --> 01:02:05,880
They're trying to get us back to.

1295
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:06,960
Someone just opened this door.

1296
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:07,880
No, they're not.

1297
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:08,740
They're still over there.

1298
01:02:08,740 --> 01:02:10,780
Why don't you guys look over here, too, and shoot this team
if you guys can.

1299
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:11,740
Okay, I'll go shoot.

1300
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:13,760
I'm shooting left.

1301
01:02:14,260 --> 01:02:15,040
I'll do that.

1302
01:02:15,620 --> 01:02:17,300
All right, we need to get underneath these guys, by the way.

1303
01:02:17,740 --> 01:02:18,060
It's okay.

1304
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:18,980
I closed this door.

1305
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:19,640
We're good.

1306
01:02:19,940 --> 01:02:20,320
Oh, we...

1307
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:21,300
Okay, where do we have to go?

1308
01:02:21,660 --> 01:02:23,260
We need to get underneath them right now on the second
floor.

1309
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:24,300
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1310
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:25,720

I want to see if there's anyone in the driver's car.

So we could easily get in there if we need to.

I'm ready.

1334
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:14,940
They're taking first floor.

They're about to fight, they're about to fight over here.

We're just putting barrels down here and start shooting
them.

1473
01:06:44,660 --> 01:06:45,700
They're gonna start swinging us on the bottom side.

01:06:45,900 --> 01:06:46,040
We're good.

1475
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:48,140
They lost their cossack.

1476
01:06:48,820 --> 01:06:50,220

1477
01:06:51,260 --> 01:06:51,400

1481
01:06:55,120 --> 01:06:55,740
No, no one here.

1482
01:06:55,800 --> 01:06:56,580
No way to draw on the side.

1483
01:06:56,700 --> 01:06:57,360
They're right here now.

1484
01:06:57,860 --> 01:06:59,160

I would say we need to wipe these guys.

1490
01:07:07,660 --> 01:07:09,200
They need to walk out first floor before we did jump off.

1491
01:07:09,420 --> 01:07:09,820
Wait right here.

1492
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:10,500

01:07:10,980 --> 01:07:11,800

01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,220
Take space, take space, come with me, come with me.

1511
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:34,680
That's a walk.

1512
01:07:34,860 --> 01:07:35,440
Oh, you have your ulti, right?

1513
01:07:35,540 --> 01:07:35,760
You have your ulti?

1514
01:07:36,660 --> 01:07:37,600
No, no, I don't.

1515
01:07:37,860 --> 01:07:38,480
temple Tammu's.

1516
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:38,860
Oh, tell me you do.

1517
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:40,580
Two teams fighting here, yes, I do.

1518
01:07:40,980 --> 01:07:42,740
Ta-man, you're gonna hold these kids off, you're gonna hold
this kid off right now.

1519
01:07:43,540 --> 01:07:44,380
I'm with Nate, I'm needing.

1520
01:07:45,080 --> 01:07:45,960
Yeah, go with our grenades.

1521
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:47,140
One team here?

1522
01:07:47,820 --> 01:07:48,700
Yeah, but just play my staircase.

1523
01:07:48,860 --> 01:07:49,460
We're good, play near me.

1524
01:07:50,220 --> 01:07:52,440
Tempo, jump down, come right onto me because you're gonna
die when you jump off.

1525
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:54,960
I'm safe here.

1526
01:07:55,360 --> 01:07:55,900
Well, wait, no, no, I'm not.

1527
01:07:55,900 --> 01:07:56,920
Yeah, I'm safe here.

1528
01:07:56,980 --> 01:07:57,700
I'm safe here for now.

1529
01:07:57,800 --> 01:07:58,500
Yeah, back up with it.

1530
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:01,840
Gotta get some barrels down, tempo, and try to ulti forward
if we need to.

1531
01:08:02,660 --> 01:08:03,140
They're right here.

1532
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:03,540
They're right here.

1533
01:08:04,220 --> 01:08:04,720
They're right here.

1534
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:04,920
They're right here.

1535
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:05,580
There you go.

1536
01:08:05,580 --> 01:08:07,200
I'm going to scan them, needing.

1537
01:08:08,980 --> 01:08:09,200
Yeah, yeah.

1538
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:10,460
Tempo, throw your ulti on these kids again.

1539
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:10,920
Throw it.

1540
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:11,180
Throw it.

1541
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:11,340
Throw it.

1542
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:15,280
Oh, they're not there.

1543
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:16,120
Oh, I know.

1544
01:08:16,120 --> 01:08:16,760
I know, but you need to throw it out.

1545
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:18,040
We saw on the one side of the right side over here.

1546
01:08:18,340 --> 01:08:18,520
Somewhere.

1547
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,040
These kids have no angles on the right side.

1548
01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:20,780
You need to just pressure them.

1549
01:08:20,860 --> 01:08:22,420
You need to throw this ulti right here in this corner.

1550
01:08:23,420 --> 01:08:23,560
Oh.

1551
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:24,660
That's fine.

1552
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:25,760
I hit the wall.

1553
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:27,200
Oh my god.

1554
01:08:28,180 --> 01:08:29,380
There's no fucking way.

1555
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:30,140
You just hit the wall.

1556
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:31,260
We're fine.

1557
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:31,880
We're fine.

1558
01:08:32,060 --> 01:08:32,460
We're fine.

1559
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:33,660
We're good.

1560
01:08:34,840 --> 01:08:35,280
There's no shot.

1561
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:38,200
That guy's a rat.

1562
01:08:38,420 --> 01:08:39,100
That's the last second.

1563
01:08:39,320 --> 01:08:39,600
That is a rat.

1564
01:08:40,380 --> 01:08:40,520
That is a rat.

1565
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:40,720
That's right.

1566
01:08:40,740 --> 01:08:41,700
Keep him barrels forward.

1567
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:42,600
Tempo, keep him barrels forward.

1568
01:08:42,840 --> 01:08:43,200
We're good.

1569
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:44,460
There's a rat right here.

1570
01:08:44,540 --> 01:08:45,340
We want to rush that.

1571
01:08:45,420 --> 01:08:45,940
They're costing us.

1572
01:08:46,220 --> 01:08:47,540
They're costing us.

1573
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:49,420
Oh, I didn't realize that was your third costing us.

1574
01:08:49,700 --> 01:08:49,880
No.

1575
01:08:50,380 --> 01:08:50,920
Oh my god.

1576
01:08:51,700 --> 01:08:52,580
Tempo, you hat.

1577
01:08:52,620 --> 01:08:52,840
Fuck.

1578
01:08:56,040 --> 01:08:57,360
We just needed to...

1579
01:08:57,360 --> 01:08:58,480
I didn't see the wall.

1580
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:00,500
I didn't see the wall and I hit it by mistake.

1581
01:09:00,520 --> 01:09:02,560
Oh my god!

1582
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:09,040
We were just waiting for Tempo to do his thing.

1583
01:09:10,140 --> 01:09:11,600
No, okay, okay, wait, wait, wait.

1584
01:09:11,780 --> 01:09:12,660
That's real life, dude.

1585
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:13,300
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1586
01:09:13,300 --> 01:09:14,160
It didn't hit the wall.

1587
01:09:14,680 --> 01:09:16,540
It hit Wig's gigantic head.

1588
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:19,560
Wait, you're gonna flavor IGL?

1589
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:21,260
Yeah!

1590
01:09:21,960 --> 01:09:23,480
Yeah, Wig, your head was in the way.

1591
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:25,560
Are you fucking kidding me?

1592
01:09:26,660 --> 01:09:27,100
Me!

1593
01:09:33,420 --> 01:09:34,740
Oh my god.

1594
01:09:35,080 --> 01:09:37,320
That was so bad if we had that ulti.

1595
01:09:38,220 --> 01:09:39,460
My heart hurts.

1596
01:09:39,860 --> 01:09:40,880
Great game, guys.

1597
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:41,680
Great game out of us.

1598
01:09:41,860 --> 01:09:42,460
We got third.

1599
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:43,660
We got so many kills.

1600
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:44,740
Yeah, we're good.

1601
01:09:44,820 --> 01:09:46,240
We qualify for next round, 100%.

1602
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:47,500
Good job.

1603
01:09:47,540 --> 01:09:47,860
Wait, wait.

1604
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:49,000
Good job, Tempo.

1605
01:09:50,020 --> 01:09:51,420
Staying alive and take that evac tower.

1606
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:51,800
Good job.

1607
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:54,000
Don't nervous.

1608
01:09:54,240 --> 01:09:55,420
You got a good call on the evac.

1609
01:09:55,620 --> 01:09:57,180
Wait, how did you get up there, Doki?

1610
01:09:57,440 --> 01:09:58,720
It was a Horizon Q.

1611
01:09:59,020 --> 01:09:59,800
I just took the Q.

1612
01:10:02,260 --> 01:10:04,680
Where the fuck did a Horizon Q come from?

1613
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:04,960
I don't know.

1614
01:10:05,020 --> 01:10:05,960
It just showed up.

1615
01:10:06,020 --> 01:10:06,860
I was like, yay.

1616
01:10:07,640 --> 01:10:09,480
I was like, okay, Doki's with me.

1617
01:10:09,560 --> 01:10:11,240
At least we can wrap around and do something.

1618
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:13,600
And I was like, oh, someone came in to kill me.

1619
01:10:13,660 --> 01:10:14,840
And I'm like, where did you go?

1620
01:10:15,580 --> 01:10:17,080
I can't believe that Q.

1621
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:18,100
Change name.

1622
01:10:18,240 --> 01:10:18,760
Change name.

1623
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:19,880
We got to.

1624
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:20,720
We got to unite.

1625
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:22,540
It's not going to let me.

1626
01:10:22,540 --> 01:10:23,000
It's going to do that.

1627

Yeah, that's crazy.

That's, okay, please don't, okay, Tempo.

1635

Wait, what am I?

Watson?

1638
01:11:08,820 --> 01:11:10,740
I think I can still play Cossack on this.

1639
01:11:11,060 --> 01:11:11,740
You could, yeah.

1640
01:11:11,820 --> 01:11:12,680
You might want to be honest.

1641
01:11:12,820 --> 01:11:13,220
Fuck it.

1642
01:11:14,460 --> 01:11:15,200
Let's see.

1643
01:11:16,160 --> 01:11:17,640
We're going to be...

1644
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:19,040
Where do we want to go?

1645
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:20,880
Oh, lightning rod.

1646
01:11:21,060 --> 01:11:21,920
Everyone can...

1647
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:23,260
I'm down, actually.

1648
01:11:23,780 --> 01:11:24,600
I know, right?

1649
01:11:24,740 --> 01:11:25,480
Am I doing the same?

1650
01:11:25,580 --> 01:11:26,560
Am I playing Bloodhound still?

1651
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:27,840
Oh, yeah.

1652
01:11:27,940 --> 01:11:31,200
I mean, if you want to, are you more comfortable on, are you
more comfortable on Bangalore here?

1653
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:32,040
Because Bangalore is pretty good.

1654
01:11:32,100 --> 01:11:32,700
I can do either.

1655
01:11:33,460 --> 01:11:34,000
We can do the...

1656
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:34,460
I can do Bang.

1657
01:11:34,620 --> 01:11:34,840
Yeah.

1658
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:36,200

01:11:36,260 --> 01:11:36,660
We'll see how it goes.

1660
01:11:37,940 --> 01:11:39,060
We're experimenting now.

1661
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:39,720
We're going to...

1662
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:41,700

Okay.

01:16:13,260 --> 01:16:14,500
All right, we're going we're going lightning rod.

1722
01:16:14,920 --> 01:16:17,200
If there's anyone there I don't really know what to say if
I'm being completely honest.

1723
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:20,580
We we we deviate to Zeus Yeah, probably actually.

1724
01:16:22,360 --> 01:16:25,220
Yeah Probably I think we're good.

1725
01:16:25,460 --> 01:16:28,540
Yeah All right, well, let's see what happens.

1726
01:16:28,900 --> 01:16:30,060
You know your jump master, right?

1727
01:16:30,180 --> 01:16:30,780
No, I had no idea.

1728
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:30,960
Okay.

1729
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:34,780
Sorry guys Uh, there might be a team there actually now
because I jump late in there.

1730
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:36,020
Yeah, it's okay.

1731
01:16:36,040 --> 01:16:37,320
I think that might be called it.

1732
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:40,320
Yeah, I think those two are just teams.

1733
01:16:40,440 --> 01:16:43,340
There's no way they would contest two teams are fighting at
a new site.

1734
01:16:43,340 --> 01:16:43,620
Yeah, we're fine.

1735
01:16:43,780 --> 01:16:43,940
We're fine.

1736
01:16:44,460 --> 01:16:45,100
Where's the beacon?

1737
01:16:45,560 --> 01:16:46,980
Why the fuck are they contesting?

1738
01:16:47,540 --> 01:16:49,200
There's like 13 teams.

1739
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:50,460
I don't know why you would.

1740
01:16:50,580 --> 01:16:50,940
It's so...

1741
01:16:50,940 --> 01:16:51,900
Unless you really don't like a team.

1742
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:53,120
I'm just gonna go here.

1743
01:16:53,260 --> 01:16:54,420
There's no beacon at Lightning Rod.

1744
01:16:54,820 --> 01:16:55,460
Okay, I'm gonna land here.

1745
01:16:55,900 --> 01:16:56,440
I'll land backside.

1746
01:17:00,980 --> 01:17:03,240
Just in case that team decides to come this way.

1747
01:17:04,240 --> 01:17:05,820
After realizing they're being contested.

1748
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:09,580
I feel like they would realize you're being contested like
very early.

1749
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:14,200
The fact that they're still committed to it is actually
crazy though.

1750
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:25,620
low key I think they saw that too oh god I have the buster
sword on this character I look ridiculous the balk sword I

1751
01:17:25,620 --> 01:17:33,220
wrote in chat like went during the whole cost of seeing that
guys don't worry you're gonna watch tempo carry and then

1752
01:17:33,220 --> 01:17:39,040
people thought that was like the moment where like the the
whole he got that one kill and they're like this is it this

1753
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:53,140
is where tempo carries little do they know yeah what do you

I did not loot that.

1788
01:18:59,880 --> 01:19:00,380
No, no, no.

1789
01:19:00,500 --> 01:19:01,980
Oh, Jesus, someone's here.

1790
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:03,140
I did not loot that.

1791
01:19:03,240 --> 01:19:04,080
I looted this.

1792
01:19:04,860 --> 01:19:07,320
Well, someone looted that, so I'm running away.

1793
01:19:07,700 --> 01:19:08,880

You got the wrong upgrade?

1801
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,800
Was it the tactical cooldown or the ultimate tactical?

1802
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:48,440
Yeah, it was tactical.

1803
01:19:49,060 --> 01:19:50,400
I got the eater.

01:19:51,940 --> 01:19:52,080
Okay.

1806
01:19:52,500 --> 01:19:52,740
It's fine.

1807
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:53,220
All right.

1808
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:53,660
Let's go.

1809
01:19:53,700 --> 01:19:54,600
We're gonna take this cannon.

1810
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:55,300
To be honest.

1811
01:19:55,640 --> 01:19:56,600
I'm ready.

1812
01:19:56,960 --> 01:19:57,620
Oh, wait.

1813
01:19:57,860 --> 01:19:58,320
There is a band.

1814
01:19:59,020 --> 01:20:00,840
I'm checking it out.

1815
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:01,400
There's someone there.

1816
01:20:01,540 --> 01:20:01,820
Don't take.

1817
01:20:01,900 --> 01:20:02,220
Don't take.

1818
01:20:02,260 --> 01:20:02,560
Don't take.

1819
01:20:02,680 --> 01:20:03,080
There's someone there.

1820
01:20:03,740 --> 01:20:04,660
I kind of want to...

1821
01:20:04,660 --> 01:20:09,380
I think we go back to me and go into command and maybe hit
the beacon scan.

1822
01:20:09,480 --> 01:20:10,740
But we need to hit a fucking beacon.

1823
01:20:10,780 --> 01:20:11,620
Actually, fuck that.

1824
01:20:11,720 --> 01:20:12,520
Let's go back towards Zeus.

1825
01:20:12,660 --> 01:20:12,920
Let's go.

1826
01:20:13,160 --> 01:20:14,920
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1827
01:20:15,220 --> 01:20:16,420
We go back towards Zeus and go from there.

1828
01:20:16,700 --> 01:20:18,280
I feel like we were supposed to take the car.

1829
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:20,440
I should ask Raven what we were supposed to do here.

1830
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:21,060
Oh, oh, yeah.

1831
01:20:21,080 --> 01:20:21,780
Oh, we probably should have.

1832
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:22,240
Yeah, 100%.

1833
01:20:22,240 --> 01:20:22,460
It's okay.

1834
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:22,940
That's not what it is.

1835
01:20:23,420 --> 01:20:23,960
Just walk it.

1836
01:20:25,740 --> 01:20:26,580
They just left Zeus.

1837
01:20:26,740 --> 01:20:27,140
So we should be fine.

1838
01:20:27,800 --> 01:20:27,980
They did?

1839
01:20:28,380 --> 01:20:28,880
Yeah, they did.

1840
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:29,560
They just left there now.

1841
01:20:30,940 --> 01:20:32,680
So we should be fine on the rotation then.

1842
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:40,840
All right, we'll hit the circle scan and then we'll come
back down and see where we have to go from there.

1843
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:44,940
We can, yeah, that, that, and then boom.

1844
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:45,260
Okay.

1845
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:48,520
I'm going to craft one battery as well, because I have only
one.

1846
01:20:48,820 --> 01:20:50,380
So I'm going to craft one up.

1847
01:20:50,760 --> 01:20:51,780
I have three bats.

1848
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:54,640
Tempo, go hit that circle scan whenever you can.

1849
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:55,720
Yep.

01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:34,680
You just arc stick one while they're resing, and then you
just spitfire them to death, and then we win.

1999
01:29:35,060 --> 01:29:36,120
Oh, I don't know.

2000
01:29:36,160 --> 01:29:36,640

handle thingy.

01:31:02,160 --> 01:31:03,160
I blame the servers.

2022
01:31:03,460 --> 01:31:05,240
We're literally in East Coast.

I don't know what you guys are talking about.

2026
01:31:14,100 --> 01:31:16,180
Guys, we need a reset here.

2027
01:31:16,440 --> 01:31:17,160
We need...

2028
01:31:17,860 --> 01:31:19,100
I mean, what's top six?

2029
01:31:19,140 --> 01:31:19,720
How many points is that?

2030
01:31:19,740 --> 01:31:20,000
Three?

2031
01:31:21,580 --> 01:31:22,220
Three, right?

2032
01:31:22,500 --> 01:31:22,860

2033
01:31:23,620 --> 01:31:23,980
Yeah.

2034
01:31:24,220 --> 01:31:24,580
All right.

2035
01:31:24,720 --> 01:31:25,080
It's not bad.

2036
01:31:25,140 --> 01:31:26,720
I mean, 17 is not going to be awful for us.

2037
01:31:26,760 --> 01:31:27,960
We're definitely qualified for sure.

2038
01:31:28,180 --> 01:31:29,220
Yeah, we're definitely qualified.

2039
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:31,820
There's no way one team's going to fucking kick.

2040
01:31:32,020 --> 01:31:34,200
I do like making the end games, guys.

Nice.

2051
01:31:46,300 --> 01:31:47,060
I blame Doki.

2052
01:31:47,460 --> 01:31:48,440
How do you blame me?

2053
01:31:48,440 --> 01:31:48,780
No, fair.

2054
01:31:48,880 --> 01:31:49,260
No, it's fine.

2055
01:31:49,900 --> 01:31:50,260
I'm down.

2056
01:31:50,300 --> 01:31:51,400
I'm so down for that.

2057
01:31:51,440 --> 01:31:51,700
That's fine.

2058
01:31:53,520 --> 01:31:54,160
Yeah, yeah.

2059
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:55,080
It's two against one.

2060
01:31:55,260 --> 01:31:55,800
We can't lose.

2061
01:31:55,920 --> 01:31:56,820
Yeah, it's two against one.

2062
01:31:56,940 --> 01:31:57,340
You lose.

2063
01:31:57,340 --> 01:31:58,380
I made it.

2064
01:31:58,620 --> 01:31:59,940
Wait, what happened?

2065
01:32:02,160 --> 01:32:03,820
Our pact is over now.

2066
01:32:04,540 --> 01:32:05,600
He's going to play aggressive.

2067
01:32:06,080 --> 01:32:08,540
Oh, what are they looking at?

2068
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:10,460
Why are they playing so aggressive or a duo?

2069
01:32:10,460 --> 01:32:11,660
I love that.

2070
01:32:11,780 --> 01:32:12,000
Yeah.

2071
01:32:13,380 --> 01:32:14,380
I'm going to be honest, bro.

2072
01:32:14,400 --> 01:32:15,100
I didn't know right that kid.

2073
01:32:15,160 --> 01:32:16,480
I think I could have killed him.

2074
01:32:16,740 --> 01:32:18,400
Yeah, but then his duo is going to kill you.

2075
01:32:18,920 --> 01:32:20,140
No, he would have made it out.

2076
01:32:20,640 --> 01:32:22,280
I would have, I would have got a battle off, to be honest.

2077
01:32:22,320 --> 01:32:23,500
That was crazy how bad that lag was.

2078

Where was our luck here?

We're good to go.

2374
01:49:36,640 --> 01:49:37,220
Let's see what goes on.

2375
01:49:37,280 --> 01:49:39,420
And we're gonna go towards...

2376
01:49:40,860 --> 01:49:41,300
Let's see.

2377
01:49:41,480 --> 01:49:41,680
First.

2378
01:49:43,280 --> 01:49:45,180
Ooh, that's a really good knowledge for us to have.

2379
01:49:45,280 --> 01:49:45,420
Okay.

2380
01:49:45,720 --> 01:49:46,420
We're gonna go get...

2381
01:49:46,420 --> 01:49:48,620
We're gonna go out this left side over here.

2382
01:49:48,700 --> 01:49:50,360
We're gonna go get the people scan, then we're gonna go.

2383
01:49:50,440 --> 01:49:51,100
We're gonna go right to zone.

2384
01:49:51,120 --> 01:49:51,800
Right behind you?

2385
01:49:52,400 --> 01:49:53,120
Yeah, we're good.

2386
01:49:53,260 --> 01:49:53,520
All right.

2387
01:49:53,560 --> 01:49:54,480
We're playing this right, guys.

2388
01:49:54,500 --> 01:49:56,160
This is the way we should play it in the actual game, too.

2389
01:49:56,660 --> 01:49:58,540
I can't believe we're actually doing it.

2390
01:49:58,840 --> 01:50:00,200
We're learning from our mistakes.

2391
01:50:00,700 --> 01:50:02,180
Yeah, we're slowly but surely learning.

2392
01:50:02,440 --> 01:50:07,120
Yeah, it's like if we actually did scripts, we might have
No, actually though.

2393
01:50:09,120 --> 01:50:10,980
We could have done something with our lives guys.

2394
01:50:11,120 --> 01:50:14,600
I feel like if we actually sort of practiced for this, we
could have, you know, made it pretty far.

2395
01:50:15,400 --> 01:50:15,400
Yeah.

2396
01:50:15,580 --> 01:50:15,580
Yeah.

2397
01:50:16,260 --> 01:50:18,740
Hey, we're past first round guys, it's all that matters.

2398
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:20,460
Yeah, yeah, we're past first round.

2399
01:50:20,480 --> 01:50:22,760
We didn't do worse than we did last week, which is right.

2400
01:50:22,960 --> 01:50:23,760
Should I grab the skin?

2401
01:50:24,280 --> 01:50:24,520
Why?

2402
01:50:24,540 --> 01:50:24,960
What thing?

2403
01:50:25,200 --> 01:50:25,680
I have a cashier.

2404
01:50:25,800 --> 01:50:26,000
Go for it.

2405
01:50:26,080 --> 01:50:26,360
Yeah, 100%.

2406
01:50:26,380 --> 01:50:29,100
Well, I mean, if we place below top five...

2407
01:50:30,020 --> 01:50:31,760
Oh, okay.

2408
01:50:31,880 --> 01:50:32,220
I know where to go.

2409
01:50:32,380 --> 01:50:33,940
Let's go into zone when you guys are ready.

2410
01:50:34,180 --> 01:50:35,820
No one knows right now.

2411
01:50:36,320 --> 01:50:36,480
Yeah.

2412
01:50:36,700 --> 01:50:37,000
Cut to me.

01:50:37,040 --> 01:50:37,260
Cut to me.

2414
01:50:37,720 --> 01:50:39,820
Yeah, we have three Rita ploys, too, by the way.

2415
01:50:40,180 --> 01:50:40,580
That's fine.

2416
01:50:40,760 --> 01:50:41,120
Just come to me.

2417
01:50:41,180 --> 01:50:41,660
We're going to beat them.

2418
01:50:42,220 --> 01:50:42,860
We should at least.

2419
01:50:43,020 --> 01:50:43,140
We'll see.

2420
01:50:43,900 --> 01:50:45,240
We have three Rita ploys.

2421
01:50:45,460 --> 01:50:45,940

2427
01:50:54,630 --> 01:51:05,110
All I'm going to say is that if we place below top five, in
last week i agree i fully agree with with 13 teams instead

2428
01:51:05,110 --> 01:51:05,910

01:51:59,030 --> 01:52:00,530
Our safe space is the staircase, by the way.

2440
01:52:00,670 --> 01:52:00,750
Okay.

2441
01:52:02,030 --> 01:52:02,910
Those guys are red.

01:52:04,070 --> 01:52:05,770
That team is red, by the way.

2443
01:52:06,090 --> 01:52:06,250
That's fine.

2444
01:52:06,450 --> 01:52:07,190
What the fuck?

2445
01:52:11,730 --> 01:52:13,110
They're so scared of you right now.

2446
01:52:13,270 --> 01:52:14,250
Let's go.

2447
01:52:14,970 --> 01:52:16,910
Eat this four to ten charge rifle.

2448
01:52:18,870 --> 01:52:20,110
You're welcome, by the way.

2449
01:52:20,270 --> 01:52:21,270
That was my opening.

2450
01:52:22,770 --> 01:52:23,410
Oh, I have to reload.

2451
01:52:23,550 --> 01:52:23,930
That sucks.

2452
01:52:24,650 --> 01:52:26,610
There's a sniper ammo right here if you need it.

2453
01:52:26,870 --> 01:52:27,710
They might be like, oh.

2454
01:52:29,310 --> 01:52:31,370
They might be like, yo, that's a charge level and a fucking
lumbar.

2455
01:52:31,530 --> 01:52:32,770
That's definitely minus tempo in team.

2456
01:52:32,870 --> 01:52:33,590
We're going to fight this much.

2457
01:52:34,550 --> 01:52:36,210
That's so far, right?

2458
01:52:36,490 --> 01:52:37,290
No, stop moving.

2459
01:52:37,670 --> 01:52:38,590
Wait, I would fight them immediately.

2460
01:52:38,770 --> 01:52:41,150
For round two, are we all changing our full names?

2461
01:52:41,750 --> 01:52:42,390
I'm down if we want to.

2462
01:52:42,610 --> 01:52:43,510
Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay, okay.

2463
01:52:43,750 --> 01:52:44,510
I got a name.

2464
01:52:44,590 --> 01:52:45,390
I got a name already.

2465
01:52:46,390 --> 01:52:47,190
What are you going to name yourself?

2466
01:52:47,670 --> 01:52:48,230
Don't worry.

2467
01:52:48,310 --> 01:52:48,950
It'll be a secret.

2468
01:52:49,250 --> 01:52:52,650
We can't say it aloud because what's the point of saying?

2469
01:52:53,150 --> 01:52:54,410
Well, no, it's going to be on screen anyway.

2470
01:52:54,510 --> 01:52:55,430
They're going to know in 10 minutes.

2471
01:52:56,870 --> 01:53:07,270
after the first game you know true they won't know until
after the first game one two three four one more here we're

2472
01:53:07,270 --> 01:53:12,570
in such a good spot right now by the way are we okay where
is everyone this team behind us they're gonna be on outside

2473
01:53:12,570 --> 01:53:17,970
of jurassic there's not many spots to play in jurassic if i
push for this i'm looking i'm looking for us right now onto

2474
01:53:17,970 --> 01:53:23,970
kramer kramer on the front side oh that's not oh you want to
play kramer versus charge rifle kramer no we don't

2475
01:53:27,470 --> 01:53:31,870
Oh, you wanna, who will win a charge rifle or a Kramer?

2476
01:53:32,330 --> 01:53:33,490
My charge rifle is a Kramer.

2477
01:53:33,950 --> 01:53:38,710
Respectfully the tempo, charge rifle would not beat that,
even if she's the best charge rifle player in the world.

2478
01:53:40,710 --> 01:53:44,070
What kind of fucking comparison is that?

2479
01:53:45,370 --> 01:53:46,930
Yeah, you wanna go toe to toe with me?

2480
01:53:47,030 --> 01:53:48,250
It's like, God damn right, I do.

2481
01:53:48,350 --> 01:53:48,770
What's fucking?

2482
01:53:49,850 --> 01:53:50,790
You guys got a charge rifle.

2483
01:53:51,850 --> 01:53:52,530
Oh, wait, why you guys are up?

2484

Why you guys are down here?

2485
01:53:53,110 --> 01:53:54,170
I'll make a mistake, maybe.

2486
01:53:54,530 --> 01:53:55,090
It's like, play there.

2487
01:53:55,470 --> 01:53:56,410
You're gonna get a stake?

2488
01:53:56,870 --> 01:54:02,590
to make a mistake he's gonna make a mistake he's gonna do
something wrong potentially what is he doing person or

2489
01:54:02,590 --> 01:54:05,910
they're fighting over in power i'm trying to see if i get

2665
01:58:53,010 --> 01:58:53,870
Yo, you guys want to smoke.

2666
01:58:53,870 --> 01:58:54,410
So long, I left.

2667
01:58:55,090 --> 01:58:56,170
I mean, now it's good smoke.

2668
01:58:56,270 --> 01:58:56,910
We're gonna get underneath them.

2669
01:58:56,950 --> 01:58:57,390
Just get underneath them.

2670
01:58:57,550 --> 01:58:58,070
We're gonna look backwards, okay?

2671
01:58:58,390 --> 01:58:59,450
Go now, go now, go now, go now.

2672
01:58:59,810 --> 01:59:00,270
I'm gonna left.

2673
01:59:00,410 --> 01:59:01,010
Oh my god.

2674
01:59:01,170 --> 01:59:02,670
This solo is gonna turn off to the solo.

2675
01:59:02,670 --> 01:59:03,910
Let's shoot the solo, shoot the solo.

2676
01:59:04,310 --> 01:59:04,790
We're dead.

2677
01:59:04,930 --> 01:59:05,230
We can't do it.

2678
01:59:05,490 --> 01:59:06,410
No, there's no way.

2679
01:59:06,530 --> 01:59:08,290
There's not enough people alive for us to do it, I think.

2680
01:59:08,450 --> 01:59:08,850
GG's.

2681
01:59:08,950 --> 01:59:09,290
John.

2682
01:59:10,110 --> 01:59:10,830
Hey, we'll take that.

2683
01:59:10,950 --> 01:59:11,550
We literally can't do it.

2684
01:59:11,970 --> 01:59:12,450
Yeah, we'll take that.

2685
01:59:12,450 --> 01:59:12,750
We'll take that.

2686
01:59:14,590 --> 01:59:15,510
I didn't know.

2687
01:59:15,910 --> 01:59:15,990
Yeah.

2688
01:59:16,370 --> 01:59:19,930
I mean, we got so many kills though for four, we're
definitely qualified.

2689
01:59:20,310 --> 01:59:20,570
Oh, no.

2690
01:59:20,730 --> 01:59:21,850
We definitely good job, guys.

2691
01:59:22,410 --> 01:59:22,930
That was good.

2692
01:59:23,070 --> 01:59:23,950
We played that really good.

2693
01:59:24,090 --> 01:59:25,430
That 3v3, like really well.

2694
01:59:25,910 --> 01:59:26,030
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2695
01:59:26,630 --> 01:59:27,970
We got so many kills.

2696
01:59:28,330 --> 01:59:29,710
That, that 410?

2697
01:59:30,430 --> 01:59:31,230
Yeah, Falken.

2698
01:59:31,530 --> 01:59:32,330
10 helps.

2699
01:59:32,670 --> 01:59:33,430
so much.

2700
01:59:33,730 --> 01:59:34,210
Yeah, I bet.

2701
01:59:34,370 --> 01:59:35,430
Welcome, that assault.

2702
01:59:35,810 --> 01:59:36,710
Everyone's just smoking.

2703
01:59:36,970 --> 01:59:38,590
I'm just like, not today, bitches.

2704
01:59:39,290 --> 01:59:40,490
Assaulting on me.

2705
01:59:47,020 --> 01:59:48,040
Yeah, there was, I don't think.

2706
01:59:48,080 --> 01:59:50,760
We had such a poor rotation into the zone.

2707
01:59:52,160 --> 01:59:55,240
I mean, that's so difficult for us because there's not
enough teams alive.

2708
01:59:55,360 --> 01:59:55,700
You know what I mean?

2709
01:59:55,760 --> 01:59:57,580
Yeah, yeah, to help us for the rotation.

2710
01:59:58,180 --> 01:59:58,480
Exactly.

2711
01:59:58,940 --> 01:59:59,020
Yeah.

2712
01:59:59,340 --> 02:00:01,200
You back from behind or something?

2713
02:00:01,420 --> 02:00:02,800
Do we have a behind to even up front?

2714
02:00:02,840 --> 02:00:03,740
No, I think we died.

2715
02:00:03,800 --> 02:00:05,360
No, I don't think we did, yeah.

2716
02:00:06,340 --> 02:00:10,960
i think we should just maybe smoke that team off and swung
the sun though i got the kps my bad i just didn't think that

2717
02:00:10,960 --> 02:00:16,080

That is crazy.

2725
02:00:43,600 --> 02:00:45,180
We need the content.

2726
02:00:46,320 --> 02:00:48,560
We're here to content farm.

2727
02:00:49,100 --> 02:00:50,460
Yeah, they fucking farm that endgame.

2728
02:00:50,600 --> 02:00:50,920
Holy shit.

2729
02:00:53,520 --> 02:00:54,520
What's fourth place for?

2730
02:00:54,620 --> 02:00:55,740
That's what's, um, nine points?

2731
02:00:55,960 --> 02:00:56,420
Nine points.

2732
02:00:56,640 --> 02:00:57,300
That's pretty good.

2733
02:00:57,580 --> 02:00:57,900
Nine points?

2734
02:00:58,040 --> 02:00:58,420
Wait a minute.

2735
02:00:58,560 --> 02:00:59,260
Yeah, we'll take that.

2736
02:00:59,260 --> 02:00:59,940
That's great game for us.

2737
02:01:00,040 --> 02:01:00,320
Yeah.

2738
02:01:00,940 --> 02:01:04,900
If, if, uh, three, four and five fucked up, then we might be
in third.

2739
02:01:05,380 --> 02:01:06,020
Oh shit.

2740
02:01:06,200 --> 02:01:06,540

No, I don't think they I don't think they died.

2742
02:01:08,200 --> 02:01:12,900

His head is in the direction.

2793
02:04:43,140 --> 02:04:43,720
Five meters.

2794
02:04:44,660 --> 02:04:46,360
It's the Doki GPS.

2795
02:04:47,220 --> 02:04:48,780
Literally, oh my God, that'd be awful.

2796
02:04:49,100 --> 02:04:50,640
What do you mean, awful?

2797
02:04:50,900 --> 02:04:55,760
You telling me how to drive somewhere sounds like the closer
you are, the louder the laugh gets.

2798
02:04:56,080 --> 02:04:57,260
Oh my god.

2799
02:04:58,980 --> 02:05:04,640
You know, you know, you know, there's, uh, you know, there's
things you can, there's like a mod, a mod that you can put

2800
02:05:04,640 --> 02:05:09,320
on your Google Maps that you can replace with other people's
voices.

2801
02:05:09,640 --> 02:05:10,060
Oh, I love that.

2802
02:05:10,140 --> 02:05:10,420

Oh, my God.

2814
02:05:25,320 --> 02:05:27,260
Imagine the content.

2815
02:05:27,940 --> 02:05:29,740
You know how the cars beep when you're closer?

2816
02:05:29,980 --> 02:05:30,060
Yeah.

2817
02:05:30,240 --> 02:05:34,340
When you're like parking and you're closer to a wall, you
just hear Doki yelling, beep, beep.

2818
02:05:36,780 --> 02:05:38,540
I can't believe you got two kills, bro.

2819
02:05:38,640 --> 02:05:39,160
You're the goat.

2820
02:05:39,580 --> 02:05:40,740
Oh my god.

2821
02:05:41,160 --> 02:05:41,820
Here's the school bus.

2822
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:44,200
But remember who helped him get those two kills.

2823
02:05:44,420 --> 02:05:46,300
We're all spitting though, spitting.

2824
02:05:46,820 --> 02:05:47,780
Let him go.

2825
02:05:47,900 --> 02:05:49,700
I love the school bus charge.

east that's not my right what are you saying that's not top

2831
02:06:13,620 --> 02:06:22,740
east that's not to say northeast you broke my brain just
then with that statement like you actually there's no way

2832
02:06:22,740 --> 02:06:26,020
you guys okay i'm looking at I'm looking at that compass
thingy.

2833
02:06:26,480 --> 02:06:27,860
You guys actually use that?

2834
02:06:28,360 --> 02:06:28,700
Yes.

2835
02:06:29,520 --> 02:06:29,820
Yes.

2836
02:06:30,400 --> 02:06:31,020
Of course.

2837
02:06:31,920 --> 02:06:34,580
I have to learn to use it for a competitive.

2838
02:06:35,060 --> 02:06:35,380
What do you?

2839
02:06:35,600 --> 02:06:35,800
Yeah.

2840
02:06:36,340 --> 02:06:37,980
Quite frequently I use that actually.

2841
02:06:39,640 --> 02:06:40,200
Tempo.

2842
02:06:40,600 --> 02:06:42,520
People in competitive use the compass.

2843
02:06:43,160 --> 02:06:43,800
All the time.

2844
02:06:44,380 --> 02:06:44,440
Yes.

2845
02:06:44,900 --> 02:06:45,340
Yeah.

2846
02:06:45,420 --> 02:06:48,500
I have trouble using the compass when I'm not playing
competitive.

2847
02:06:48,800 --> 02:06:50,640
TSM fucking always uses a...

2848
02:06:50,640 --> 02:06:51,680
What do you mean?

2849
02:06:52,680 --> 02:06:54,000
I've never met a human.

2850
02:06:54,020 --> 02:07:02,420
like this i gotta go i gotta go you know that never eat
never and never eat shredded shredded wheat or never enter

2851
02:07:02,420 --> 02:07:12,040
never enter a stinky washroom no that's how you tell like
which way the compass goes around what you go you go n e s

2852
02:07:12,040 --> 02:07:18,140
and then w and then and then you go over in a circle and
then you're like yeah yeah yeah i gotta do that every time

2853
02:07:18,140 --> 02:07:20,140
someone tells me directions in that sense

2854
02:07:24,800 --> 02:07:27,700
person that's not a real human he's a real person

2855
02:07:34,220 --> 02:07:40,680
country songs right now to smooth me out a little take the
stress off this is great it could have been the drink dude

02:07:40,680 --> 02:07:47,760
what did we tell tempo when we said we'll buy him a another
free meal or you'll buy him oh yeah i didn't go on a roof i

2857
02:07:47,760 --> 02:07:57,540

top five was it top five no me was it top five or was it top

2858
02:07:57,540 --> 02:08:05,480

don't have it you need to pop all the excels like

2862
02:08:22,820 --> 02:08:29,520
immediately like you and donky are probably just more
important than me my brain was trying to figure out how to

I asked you like three times, do you need the alt Excel?

2867
02:08:55,340 --> 02:08:57,620
And I didn't get zero responses.

2868
02:08:59,880 --> 02:09:00,140
Okay.

2869
02:09:00,280 --> 02:09:02,660
To be fair, Chrono knows this very well.

2870
02:09:02,980 --> 02:09:05,280
When I'm playing Apex, my brain is not all there.

2871
02:09:06,720 --> 02:09:08,340
Bro, my chat got support.

2872
02:09:08,420 --> 02:09:09,980
Even my chat, it's 10 minutes late.

2873
02:09:10,100 --> 02:09:12,300
And they're like, she asked like three times.

2874
02:09:17,120 --> 02:09:17,560
Christmas.

2875
02:09:18,760 --> 02:09:20,480
No one saw anything, okay?

2876
02:09:20,660 --> 02:09:21,400
I'm deleting this.

2877
02:09:21,520 --> 02:09:23,340
I'm deleting.

2878
02:09:24,960 --> 02:09:31,520
I just open my chat and the first thing I hear is, the first
thing I see is he's still looting for some reason.

2879
02:09:32,260 --> 02:09:33,500
That is not believable, bro.

2880
02:09:35,900 --> 02:09:36,640
Oh, fuck.

2881
02:09:37,200 --> 02:09:38,060
VOD's deleted.

2882
02:09:38,520 --> 02:09:40,380
I don't know what anyone's talking about.

Oh my gosh.

2884
02:09:43,020 --> 02:09:44,920
Deleting the VOD off that is crazy.

2885
02:09:45,860 --> 02:09:49,160
That was the moment you had to delete the VOD.

2886
02:09:50,020 --> 02:09:51,060

02:10:42,680 --> 02:10:44,120
It's like control and lockdown.

2900
02:10:44,960 --> 02:10:46,280
There's no way I'm playing control.

2901
02:10:47,100 --> 02:10:47,800
Yeah, no shot.

2902
02:10:48,160 --> 02:10:48,300

I'm jumping right now.

2929
02:12:21,990 --> 02:12:22,550
I'm jumping right now in my game.

2930
02:12:23,510 --> 02:12:27,550
I understand if you see my POV, you'd understand.

2931
02:12:27,910 --> 02:12:28,610
Yeah, I would have got it.

2932
02:12:28,810 --> 02:12:29,410
A minute later.

2933
02:12:31,310 --> 02:12:31,670
All right.

2934
02:12:32,130 --> 02:12:36,370
Yeah, just wait 10 minutes later and you'll understand why I
said that.

2935
02:12:38,550 --> 02:12:39,970
Got my triple take.

2936
02:12:40,110 --> 02:12:41,450
We have eight kills.

2937
02:12:41,750 --> 02:12:43,250
Wait, how many kills did we have last time?

2938
02:12:44,510 --> 02:12:45,430
Definitely not eight.

2939
02:12:45,710 --> 02:12:49,970
But we did have like several second places and we haven't
had a second place yet.

2940
02:12:50,130 --> 02:12:52,130
How do I even see what we did last time?

2941
02:12:53,490 --> 02:12:56,310
And so no guy is the most wannabe movement player in the
world.

2942
02:12:56,490 --> 02:12:57,230
What is this guy doing?

2943
02:12:58,390 --> 02:12:59,870
What are you fucking doing?

2944
02:13:01,010 --> 02:13:03,190
Watching this kid just tap straight everything in these
games.

2945
02:13:03,330 --> 02:13:12,330
It hasn't hit a shot yet Look he's trying his best They
should laugh And there's just me on pretty little roller

2946
02:13:12,330 --> 02:13:18,860
you're like you don't need that The fuck who shot me?

2947
02:13:20,080 --> 02:13:28,340
Oh my goodness I found it found what We had 10 kills last
time.

2948
02:13:29,460 --> 02:13:30,940
Oh, so we didn't improve.

2949
02:13:31,620 --> 02:13:33,400
No, we moved from the placements, you know?

2950
02:13:34,080 --> 02:13:34,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2951
02:13:34,780 --> 02:13:36,200
Overall, placements had to be better this time.

2952
02:13:36,440 --> 02:13:37,580
Yeah, yeah, overall was better.

2953
02:13:38,060 --> 02:13:38,980
Yeah, had to be.

2954
02:13:39,700 --> 02:13:40,060
Nice.

2955
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:43,540
Oh, it says go to round two.

2956
02:13:44,400 --> 02:13:45,160
Go to round one?

2957
02:13:45,600 --> 02:13:45,720
Go to round two.

2958
02:13:46,160 --> 02:13:47,300
I thought it said go to round two.

2959
02:13:47,420 --> 02:13:48,380
I was looking at the wrong page.

2960
02:13:48,560 --> 02:13:49,040
They're good, they're good.

2961
02:13:50,920 --> 02:13:53,700
They got the first place got 102 points.

2962
02:13:53,760 --> 02:13:54,480
Yeah, they did.

2963
02:13:55,820 --> 02:13:57,320
My god damn.

2964
02:13:58,480 --> 02:14:01,040
Yeah, we're definitely not that part of the league.

2965
02:14:01,860 --> 02:14:02,960
No, we're not there yet.

2966
02:14:03,260 --> 02:14:05,560
We're in the part where we try to sneak by.

2967
02:14:05,640 --> 02:14:07,180
Yeah, we're the low key.

2968
02:14:07,180 --> 02:14:09,060
We're just low key existing, you know.

2969
02:14:09,340 --> 02:14:10,200
We're just there.

2970
02:14:10,700 --> 02:14:13,080
We're just trying to get on by with anyone really
recognizing us.

2971
02:14:13,280 --> 02:14:15,860
Yeah, we're like, just let us pass through, you know.

2972
02:14:19,960 --> 02:14:21,080

2973
02:14:21,380 --> 02:14:21,580
Oh, wait.

2982
02:15:09,760 --> 02:15:11,440
You have to tell me how to do it.

2983
02:15:11,660 --> 02:15:13,520
I actually, I'd buy it.

2984
02:15:13,580 --> 02:15:14,700
I'd 100 per cent buy it for you.

2985
02:15:15,660 --> 02:15:16,300
I would buy it this far.

2986
02:15:17,400 --> 02:15:21,060
I would never use it because it would drive me actually
insane, but I would do it.

2987
02:15:21,820 --> 02:15:23,860
You have to use it for like a vlog.

2988
02:15:25,280 --> 02:15:26,880
I would try it, I would try it just for you.

2989

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2990
02:15:30,360 --> 02:15:34,280
I would literally spend my entire day voice acting that.

2991
02:15:34,920 --> 02:15:35,960
Yeah, I mean, that's fire.

2992
02:15:36,200 --> 02:15:36,980
That's actually such a good idea.

2993

i'll go from here and go the back but just leave all you

3227
02:28:54,740 --> 02:29:04,640

02:29:09,760 --> 02:29:17,720
it we should be fine yeah as of right now it looks like we
are uncontested for sure really as of right now yes it does

3230
02:29:17,720 --> 02:29:23,880

3301
02:34:47,760 --> 02:34:48,420

02:34:57,150 --> 02:34:57,810
Where were you shooting?

3307
02:34:58,090 --> 02:34:58,930
I want to.

3308
02:34:59,370 --> 02:34:59,530
Yeah.

3309
02:34:59,530 --> 02:35:00,110
Yeah, it was a team.

3310
02:35:00,170 --> 02:35:01,070
It was a team in Taiwan, yeah.

3311
02:35:01,270 --> 02:35:02,210
Looking behind us.

3312
02:35:02,290 --> 02:35:03,010
Yeah, they're fighting someone else.

3313
02:35:03,590 --> 02:35:03,810
That's good.

3314
02:35:04,350 --> 02:35:05,990
Just get shots down, go for it.

3315
02:35:06,070 --> 02:35:06,990
We're going to put people up here.

3316
02:35:07,190 --> 02:35:07,490
Team here.

3317
02:35:08,090 --> 02:35:09,090
Okay, I'm going to leave after this.

3318
02:35:09,290 --> 02:35:09,590
You shoot at, too.

3319
02:35:10,370 --> 02:35:10,650
Yeah, yeah.

3320
02:35:10,910 --> 02:35:11,530
I'm going to leave right now.

3321
02:35:11,610 --> 02:35:12,490
I'm going to go get these bins.

3322
02:35:14,230 --> 02:35:15,850
He's behind that box.

3323
02:35:16,410 --> 02:35:17,410
Yeah, he's not peeing though.

3324
02:35:17,430 --> 02:35:18,930
Like I said, though, there's a lot of people that are coming
over here.

3325
02:35:18,930 --> 02:35:19,930
I think it might actually end your us.

3326
02:35:20,670 --> 02:35:21,590
Should we be here then?

3327
02:35:21,830 --> 02:35:23,010
There's another team fighting here.

3328
02:35:23,790 --> 02:35:25,670
Yeah, we should definitely play hide if it's going to end
here for sure.

3329
02:35:25,870 --> 02:35:27,010
We can evac hide if we need as well.

3330
02:35:27,190 --> 02:35:27,810
It's a really good spot.

3331
02:35:28,990 --> 02:35:30,150
I'm just trying to find a scrap.

3332
02:35:30,190 --> 02:35:31,710
There's another team fighting here, Tempo.

3333
02:35:31,910 --> 02:35:32,450
You want to shoot?

3334
02:35:33,650 --> 02:35:35,390
I'm going to look behind us still.

3335
02:35:36,210 --> 02:35:37,830
Yeah, there's a team now walking into Launchpad backside.

3336
02:35:37,970 --> 02:35:39,190
I think we're in a really good spot, guys.

3337
02:35:39,430 --> 02:35:39,670
All right.

3338
02:35:40,510 --> 02:35:41,910
This is our new home now.

3339
02:35:42,970 --> 02:35:46,970
I could 100% 1 million, 1,000% be wrong, but let's just
check it out.

3340
02:35:47,070 --> 02:35:47,870

3351
02:37:13,070 --> 02:37:20,050
more teams to die yeah we have one more one more point teams
are stream sniping.

3352
02:37:20,190 --> 02:37:23,090
You want us to make it to the next round so you get content
and clout.

3353
02:37:23,910 --> 02:37:26,170
Also, also, we're easier to kill.

3354
02:37:26,410 --> 02:37:27,570
So it's like better to have us longer.

3355
02:37:27,670 --> 02:37:31,870
Better to have us longer in the lobby so you can get higher
placement just so you guys know.

3356
02:37:31,890 --> 02:37:32,330
You're so smart.

3357
02:37:32,810 --> 02:37:35,610
So if you're stream sniping us at the moment, remember this.

3358
02:37:36,010 --> 02:37:36,930
Yeah, remember everything.

3359
02:37:37,430 --> 02:37:37,990
Remember me.

3360
02:37:38,290 --> 02:37:39,070
Remember us.

3361
02:37:39,970 --> 02:37:42,930
You'll become famous for being in our lobbies.

3362
02:37:43,710 --> 02:37:45,030
This is going to be your big break.

3363
02:37:46,990 --> 02:37:47,990
You're a big break.

3364
02:37:49,390 --> 02:37:51,250
Drake is crazy.

3365
02:37:51,370 --> 02:37:52,270
Oh my god.

3366
02:37:54,050 --> 02:37:55,670
This is your chance, guys.

3367
02:37:55,870 --> 02:37:56,690
This is your chance.

3368
02:37:56,810 --> 02:37:57,550
Let us in.

3369
02:37:59,810 --> 02:38:01,730
Just let us into round three.

3370
02:38:02,490 --> 02:38:03,030
You're going to be famous.

3371
02:38:04,410 --> 02:38:06,530
Okay, I'm going to shoot it with you.

3372
02:38:06,870 --> 02:38:06,930
I'm going to shoot it with you.

3373
02:38:06,930 --> 02:38:07,950
If we get any hits, I'll be so funny.

3374
02:38:08,110 --> 02:38:08,430
I hit one.

3375
02:38:09,390 --> 02:38:11,170
I can't even see where you're hitting it.

3376
02:38:11,430 --> 02:38:11,790
Good enough.

3377
02:38:12,590 --> 02:38:13,330
They're rotating left.

3378
02:38:13,430 --> 02:38:16,770
So I think I might pull a little more towards devastated,
but we're in a really good spot with an evac tower here.

3379
02:38:16,770 --> 02:38:22,410
it yeah they went yeah they went here that's fine they're
gonna hit the people scan i think that's what they want and

3380
02:38:22,410 --> 02:38:31,430
the ring console i see them up here yeah yeah they're right
here now oh they're finding someone 46 seconds we'll find

3381
02:38:31,430 --> 02:38:41,150
out good that's another team gone you need that oh my god
someone else has a someone else is also a caustic with a

3382
02:38:41,150 --> 02:38:41,750
charge rifle

3383
02:38:46,770 --> 02:38:54,910
person farm evil now actually i have to try i think it's my
least favorite part about it i was so useful back then yeah

3384
02:38:54,910 --> 02:39:02,430
because you were the evil farmer yeah i was the one guy with
the rifle yeah yeah give me your shoes guys what was it

3385
02:39:02,430 --> 02:39:12,210
what's it wait for i don't know uh charge or ammo what take
some bro i think i actually understood what you were saying

3386
02:39:12,210 --> 02:39:14,770
that's insane Yeah, I was like, what did he just say?

3387
02:39:14,910 --> 02:39:15,650
I agree exactly.

3388
02:39:15,750 --> 02:39:17,650
The fact that I understood that was unbelievable.

3389
02:39:18,350 --> 02:39:20,430
It's probably because I speak mumbo jumbo too.

3390
02:39:20,490 --> 02:39:22,290
I was going to pull towards Devastate.

3391
02:39:22,290 --> 02:39:23,090
We're in a really good spot though.

3392
02:39:23,150 --> 02:39:23,550
We just play up here.

3393
02:39:23,650 --> 02:39:23,870
We evac.

3394
02:39:23,910 --> 02:39:24,570
And then we evac.

3395
02:39:24,670 --> 02:39:24,950
Yeah.

3396
02:39:25,370 --> 02:39:25,990
Yeah, we're valid.

3397
02:39:26,370 --> 02:39:27,350
We have how many evacs do we have?

3398
02:39:27,830 --> 02:39:28,210
Either one.

3399
02:39:28,350 --> 02:39:28,530
You guys?

3400
02:39:28,830 --> 02:39:29,250
I have one.

3401
02:39:29,350 --> 02:39:29,970
We have two.

3402
02:39:30,030 --> 02:39:31,030
We have two evacs.

3403
02:39:31,230 --> 02:39:31,770
Okay, we're going to pop.

3404
02:39:31,890 --> 02:39:32,890
We're probably going to have to do a double evac.

3405
02:39:33,130 --> 02:39:33,950
So our sources get shot out.

3406
02:39:34,050 --> 02:39:34,670
We just jumped.

3407
02:39:34,770 --> 02:39:35,850
Team just went on to the bridge.

3408
02:39:36,490 --> 02:39:36,810
Okay, nice.

3409
02:39:41,050 --> 02:39:41,830
We're doing great right now.

3410
02:39:42,410 --> 02:39:43,150
I believe in you.

3411
02:39:43,790 --> 02:39:57,070
yeah we're valid we're all we're safe we're so safe it would
be funny we like temple got like three three bad shot from

3412
02:39:57,070 --> 02:40:06,470
that if you just not if you pooped me and then i got just
triple small yeah like keep flying to my ubus my ubus okay

3414
02:40:14,130 --> 02:40:14,630
they landed on the right.

3415
02:40:14,750 --> 02:40:15,230
I don't think they moved us.

3416
02:40:15,450 --> 02:40:15,810
Okay, okay.

3417
02:40:16,030 --> 02:40:17,150
It sounded very scary though.

3418
02:40:17,230 --> 02:40:18,910
Yeah, I was like, I looked up and I got shot.

3419
02:40:19,490 --> 02:40:20,870
Yeah, it sounded very creepy.

3420
02:40:21,130 --> 02:40:22,250
Why did I get shot?

3421
02:40:22,370 --> 02:40:23,890
What the f- Shit on?

3422
02:40:24,310 --> 02:40:25,390
What the fuck?

3423
02:40:25,870 --> 02:40:26,830
That was my bet.

3424
02:40:27,930 --> 02:40:28,950
Where did they land?

3425
02:40:29,490 --> 02:40:30,070
I'm not sure.

3426
02:40:30,230 --> 02:40:31,170
I think it landed underneath the reds.

3427
02:40:31,270 --> 02:40:31,710
I got a scan right now.

3428
02:40:31,790 --> 02:40:32,110
Yeah, scan.

3429
02:40:32,350 --> 02:40:33,050
Yeah, they went red room.

3430
02:40:33,090 --> 02:40:33,370
Red room.

3431
02:40:33,730 --> 02:40:34,310
What's red room?

3432
02:40:34,990 --> 02:40:36,150
It's like between the toes.

3433
02:40:36,290 --> 02:40:37,550
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

3434
02:40:38,710 --> 02:40:39,510
Little red rooms.

3435
02:40:39,710 --> 02:40:40,070
I'm sad.

3436
02:40:40,150 --> 02:40:42,250
I can't be helpful because I only have a carbine.

3437
02:40:42,730 --> 02:40:43,130
That's okay.

3438
02:40:43,150 --> 02:40:44,270
I'm not really doing much either.

3439
02:40:44,370 --> 02:40:49,810
I don't have I don't have enough heals for us to do any shit
like that anyway We're doing we're doing pretty good for not

3440
02:40:49,810 --> 02:40:55,830

staircase in the back over here.

3463
02:42:17,070 --> 02:42:18,270
If we can make it that way.

3464
02:42:18,530 --> 02:42:19,890
We'll see if we can get the EVAC off.

3465
02:42:20,030 --> 02:42:21,010
We're going to go very late though.

3466
02:42:23,070 --> 02:42:25,310
We want other teams to die at first before we start rotating
in on this.

3467
02:42:25,690 --> 02:42:28,490
And other teams get focused because we just go early, our
EVACs can get absolutely rocked.

3468
02:42:28,690 --> 02:42:31,410
Yeah, I feel like everyone's going to shoot our EVACs at
that point.

3469
02:42:32,090 --> 02:42:32,370
100%.

3470
02:42:32,370 --> 02:42:34,830
We need this team on the left to start moving up and stuff
like that before we get rocked.

3471
02:42:35,070 --> 02:42:36,650
How much sniper ammo do you have, Tempo?

3472
02:42:36,770 --> 02:42:38,010
You've been charged rifling forever.

3473
02:42:39,010 --> 02:42:39,530
12 more.

3474
02:42:39,830 --> 02:42:40,990
Oh, okay, that's not a lot.

3475
02:42:41,670 --> 02:42:43,790
Towards the end of like 20 seconds until the zone closes in.

3476
02:42:43,910 --> 02:42:45,210
Make sure you guys have full HP, please.

3477
02:42:45,350 --> 02:42:45,570
Okay, okay.

3478
02:42:46,590 --> 02:42:47,030
I'll try.

3479
02:42:49,690 --> 02:42:50,970
All right, a couple of you guys started coming out.

3480
02:42:51,090 --> 02:42:52,350
All right, so you see my plane over here, guys?

3481
02:42:52,490 --> 02:42:52,950
Over on devastated.

3482
02:42:53,050 --> 02:42:53,510
This thing right here.

3483
02:42:53,730 --> 02:42:55,190
We're gonna land for those staircases probably, okay?

3484
02:42:55,230 --> 02:42:55,610
Okay, okay.

3485
02:42:56,210 --> 02:42:56,750
Backside of it.

3486
02:42:56,750 --> 02:42:57,290
All the way in the back.

3487
02:42:57,890 --> 02:42:58,610
Spamping this one.

3488
02:42:58,750 --> 02:42:59,070
I don't know, I will.

3489
02:42:59,130 --> 02:42:59,870
We're gonna go late again.

3490
02:42:59,930 --> 02:43:00,330
We're gonna go late.

3491
02:43:00,970 --> 02:43:01,090
Oh.

3492
02:43:01,970 --> 02:43:03,850
We need these kids on the left to fuck off, bro.

3493
02:43:03,910 --> 02:43:04,510
Like, we can leave.

3494
02:43:04,630 --> 02:43:05,530
What are they looking at?

3495
02:43:06,030 --> 02:43:07,250
I don't know why they're staring at us.

3496
02:43:07,590 --> 02:43:08,710
Why are they staring at us?

3497
02:43:08,750 --> 02:43:10,170
Are we like, did they know it's us?

3498
02:43:10,170 --> 02:43:10,710
I don't know.

3499
02:43:12,670 --> 02:43:13,470
Maybe, honestly.

3500
02:43:13,650 --> 02:43:14,430
Who the fuck knows at this point?

3501
02:43:14,870 --> 02:43:16,890
Like, is it 10 minutes past and they know we're here?

3502
02:43:17,030 --> 02:43:17,510
I have fallen.

3503
02:43:18,010 --> 02:43:19,010
What the fuck is wrong?

3504
02:43:19,130 --> 02:43:20,730
Are you gonna smoke this hide, I think, Doki?

3505
02:43:20,850 --> 02:43:21,530
You're gonna smoke these guys.

3506
02:43:21,710 --> 02:43:22,030
No?

3507
02:43:22,470 --> 02:43:23,750
No, wait like five more seconds.

3508
02:43:23,850 --> 02:43:24,190
We're gonna go.

3509
02:43:24,190 --> 02:43:25,110
Okay, let's call for it.

3510
02:43:25,450 --> 02:43:25,710
I will.

3511
02:43:25,850 --> 02:43:26,550
I'll let you know.

3512
02:43:27,470 --> 02:43:28,490
Oh, they smoked us.

3513
02:43:28,670 --> 02:43:28,830
Nice.

3514
02:43:29,070 --> 02:43:29,290
Okay.

3515
02:43:29,550 --> 02:43:29,890
All right, ready?

3516
02:43:29,930 --> 02:43:30,130
We're gonna go.

3517
02:43:30,250 --> 02:43:31,350
Come on, go, go, go, go.

3518
02:43:32,470 --> 02:43:33,230
Here's another one.

3519
02:43:33,370 --> 02:43:34,130
I can't put the other one.

3520
02:43:34,930 --> 02:43:35,090
That's fine.

3521
02:43:35,110 --> 02:43:35,910
I'm gonna hold these two and land.

3522
02:43:36,030 --> 02:43:36,470
We're good.

3523
02:43:36,850 --> 02:43:36,870
We're good.

3524
02:43:40,170 --> 02:43:41,090
Okay, just follow my pattern.

3525
02:43:41,630 --> 02:43:46,670
Just follow me, stay up height stay on height stay on height
as high as possible Oh, there's a team right above us by the

3526
02:43:46,670 --> 02:43:47,590

3527
02:43:47,590 --> 02:43:47,710
We're fine.

3528
02:43:47,830 --> 02:43:48,190
Just come here.

3529
02:43:48,410 --> 02:43:55,690
Yeah, we're gonna land right here on silo Okay, we'll land
right here We're good What are you gonna help?

3530
02:43:56,290 --> 02:43:59,590
Offed on someone's head wait what who the fuck is this guy?

3531
02:44:01,250 --> 02:44:04,390
Wait, Tommy Don't get shot in the corner to the corner to
the corner.

3532
02:44:04,590 --> 02:44:08,790
I couldn't the other team shot I got two I killed two
friends.

3533
02:44:09,010 --> 02:44:11,110
I killed two friends What the fuck?

3534
02:44:11,310 --> 02:44:12,170
Where do those guys have?

3535
02:44:12,210 --> 02:44:13,090
You guys see those guys?

3536
02:44:13,370 --> 02:44:14,850
No, I saw you got punched.

3537
02:44:15,030 --> 02:44:16,010
I was like, who's that?

3538
02:44:16,270 --> 02:44:17,970
Wait, what just happened?

3539
02:44:18,090 --> 02:44:19,150
Who the fuck was that?

3540
02:44:19,770 --> 02:44:20,510
It's okay.

3541
02:44:20,950 --> 02:44:23,190
I killed a ranked 56th friend.

3542
02:44:23,410 --> 02:44:23,930
No, good job.

3543
02:44:24,110 --> 02:44:24,750
You guys four points.

3544
02:44:24,910 --> 02:44:26,790
But what the fuck was that?

3545
02:44:27,410 --> 02:44:27,990
Oh, wait.

3546
02:44:28,510 --> 02:44:29,670
What the fuck?

3547
02:44:30,330 --> 02:44:31,970
I didn't see anyone there at all.

3548
02:44:32,350 --> 02:44:33,910
I didn't see anyone there at all.

3549
02:44:34,230 --> 02:44:35,110
Was that the team that even acted with us?

3550
02:44:35,450 --> 02:44:35,990
I don't know.

3551
02:44:36,850 --> 02:44:38,030
I just got punched.

3552
02:44:38,170 --> 02:44:39,230
I didn't hear a thing, bro.

3553
02:44:39,270 --> 02:44:40,010
I didn't hear that.

3554
02:44:40,170 --> 02:44:41,370
Oh, JK, I didn't kill a Pred.

3555
02:44:41,470 --> 02:44:42,570
It was some other fucking...

3556
02:44:43,530 --> 02:44:44,990
Some fucking 4K shitter.

3557
02:44:45,190 --> 02:44:46,010
I don't know who they are.

3558
02:44:46,810 --> 02:44:47,110
Hello?

3559
02:44:48,350 --> 02:44:49,110
4K shitter.

3560
02:44:51,550 --> 02:44:52,890
Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.

3561
02:44:52,930 --> 02:44:54,550
I like lost that pod back.

3562
02:44:54,710 --> 02:44:55,150
Me too.

3563
02:44:55,710 --> 02:44:57,250
You said someone landed storm, right?

3564
02:44:57,950 --> 02:44:58,290
Yeah.

3565
02:44:58,830 --> 02:44:59,110
Okay.

3566
02:44:59,910 --> 02:45:04,690
So right now we've got high line, down beast, and command
that we might be able to land at.

3567
02:45:04,930 --> 02:45:07,030
Man's not bad because we can evac out of there if we need
to.

3568
02:45:07,630 --> 02:45:10,150
Okay, do we want to just aim for command then for this one?

3569
02:45:10,170 --> 02:45:10,710
Yeah, I'm down.

3570
02:45:10,890 --> 02:45:11,310
Yeah, I'm down.

3571
02:45:11,670 --> 02:45:13,830
I still don't know where they came from.

3572
02:45:14,170 --> 02:45:14,950
I'm still lost.

3573
02:45:15,210 --> 02:45:16,810
I was so confused when you got punched.

3574
02:45:17,130 --> 02:45:18,930
And I was like, that's not tempo.

3575
02:45:19,430 --> 02:45:21,430
I was like, that's a rampart.

3576
02:45:22,430 --> 02:45:23,190
That makes no sense.

3577
02:45:23,390 --> 02:45:25,570
I'm so confused as to what the fuck just happened to me.

3578
02:45:25,910 --> 02:45:26,690
Me too.

3579
02:45:27,750 --> 02:45:28,830
That was so weird.

3580
02:45:29,670 --> 02:45:31,410
Because they definitely were not there when we landed.

3581
02:45:31,610 --> 02:45:32,450
They were 100%.

3582
02:45:32,450 --> 02:45:33,550
Yeah, there was nobody there.

3583
02:45:33,670 --> 02:45:36,670
They landed the moment we, like, landed, I think.

3584
02:45:36,710 --> 02:45:39,130
That's so shit, too, because that's so fucking winnable.

3585
02:45:40,170 --> 02:45:44,430
We might have got sent on by this team inside, but we got
absolutely sent on because of that team landing on us.

3586
02:45:44,530 --> 02:45:44,630
Yeah.

3587
02:45:46,290 --> 02:45:47,050
That's crazy.

3588
02:45:47,510 --> 02:45:49,450
There was no way I could live as a rat, too.

3589
02:45:49,670 --> 02:45:52,690
No, no, no, you got even such a good job against two points.

3590
02:45:52,950 --> 02:45:54,750
You got us four points when we would have gotten one.

3591
02:45:54,930 --> 02:45:56,390
Yeah, let's go.

3592
02:45:56,910 --> 02:45:58,090
I contributed.

3593
02:45:58,690 --> 02:45:59,810
No, you did more than contribute.

3594
02:45:59,990 --> 02:46:00,550
You carried good shit.

3595
02:46:00,810 --> 02:46:02,370
That's just that's just insane.

3596
02:46:02,530 --> 02:46:03,450
I cannot believe that just happened to me.

3597
02:46:03,610 --> 02:46:03,850
I know.

3598
02:46:04,010 --> 02:46:05,150
I was like, what the fuck?

3599
02:46:05,310 --> 02:46:06,450
I was like, where did they come from?

3600
02:46:07,310 --> 02:46:09,530
Getting punched is like the least expected way to die in
that situation.

3601
02:46:10,350 --> 02:46:10,710
Yes.

3602
02:46:11,570 --> 02:46:13,690
They literally teleported into us.

3603
02:46:14,030 --> 02:46:15,510
I think they were just as surprised.

3604
02:46:15,650 --> 02:46:16,670
He's like, I think the two.

3605
02:46:16,850 --> 02:46:18,630
Yeah, they were like, because they started punching.

3606
02:46:18,910 --> 02:46:20,530
They didn't even get their guns out.

3607
02:46:20,630 --> 02:46:21,930
How did you get two kills?

3608
02:46:22,290 --> 02:46:25,430
Wait, if they were punching, yeah, then they must have
landed right when we landed.

3609
02:46:25,670 --> 02:46:25,770
Yeah.

3610
02:46:25,770 --> 02:46:26,010
I do.

3611
02:46:26,410 --> 02:46:26,670
I do.

3612
02:46:26,810 --> 02:46:26,870
Yeah.

3613
02:46:27,250 --> 02:46:27,590
I do.

3614
02:46:28,650 --> 02:46:34,330
Because like, when Wig was getting shot at, I got one down
and then the other guy, I don't know why he didn't, I mean,

3615
02:46:34,350 --> 02:46:36,390
he shot at me, but he lost the 1v1.

3616
02:46:36,570 --> 02:46:36,890
Yeah.

3617
02:46:36,990 --> 02:46:37,790
I know, he got it.

3618
02:46:37,790 --> 02:46:39,310
It's still can't embarrass him that losing that too.

3619
02:46:40,170 --> 02:46:41,290
I can't believe he lost the one.

3620
02:46:41,490 --> 02:46:42,090
They're kind of goaded.

3621
02:46:42,330 --> 02:46:42,930
They're kind of goaded.

3622
02:46:47,150 --> 02:46:48,250
Oh my god.

3623
02:46:48,770 --> 02:46:49,510
Wow, they got four.

3624
02:46:49,630 --> 02:46:51,490
The team I'm watching right now is going to win.

3625
02:46:51,770 --> 02:46:52,670
They're just farming everyone.

3626
02:46:52,810 --> 02:46:53,590
Yeah, GG's.

3627
02:46:53,730 --> 02:46:54,650
That's the farmers.

3628
02:46:58,650 --> 02:46:59,350
Oh my god.

3629
02:46:59,490 --> 02:47:00,570
All right, I need to fucking pee so bad.

3630
02:47:00,670 --> 02:47:00,910
I'm going to be back.

3631
02:47:01,110 --> 02:47:01,370
All right.

3632
02:47:02,330 --> 02:47:02,730
GG's.

3633
02:47:02,950 --> 02:47:03,650
Got 10.

3634
02:47:03,990 --> 02:47:05,090
That's better than...

3635
02:47:05,090 --> 02:47:06,310
No, dude, good kills.

3636
02:47:06,610 --> 02:47:07,550
Seriously, really good kills.

3637
02:47:07,670 --> 02:47:09,050
Those four points are going to be huge for us.

3638
02:47:09,370 --> 02:47:09,590
Yeah.

3639
02:47:10,170 --> 02:47:14,770

game then we call yeah we're good i'm gonna be all right

02:53:08,810 --> 02:53:16,490
your b stream channel and anybody that watch parties your
stream they have to give you the revenue they make from that

3713
02:53:16,490 --> 02:53:23,830
stream they need to give half to you wow i'm rich because
because you had your song played it's just like youtube when

3714
02:53:23,830 --> 02:53:31,590
they strike you you have to give half of your you give
content wait wait someone said their command oh i'm command

3715
02:53:31,590 --> 02:53:38,670
someone else said their command the run the ransom perk oh i
know we could just go towards thunder watch we wanted okay

3716
02:53:38,670 --> 02:53:45,230
depending on where the ship goes yeah we can we can check we
can check to see if pylon is open too because that

3717
02:53:45,230 --> 02:53:50,270
technically i'm gonna be honest bro i definitely think
pylon's taken but we'll see i think well barometer is

3718
02:53:50,270 --> 02:53:57,230
technically still open too because why three one two six
seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen

3719
02:54:01,230 --> 02:54:09,830
my audio back up uh barometer and pylon should technically
be open but we'll see we'll see see how it goes

3720
02:54:14,980 --> 02:54:24,120
right we can't let doki's four points go to waste we got we
got these next three games i worked so hard for those fights

3721
02:54:24,120 --> 02:54:33,460
we got this no really good two kv i just watched it back
that makes no sense how they did not kill you okay we'll see

3722
02:54:33,460 --> 02:54:38,540
if anyone goes into command there's no lightning round right
now okay yeah yeah i think i think when i said i was gonna

3723
02:54:38,540 --> 02:54:46,020
ban them from all the tournaments they got scared and left
nice that's low-key horrible but i love it power this is the

3724
02:54:46,020 --> 02:54:51,980
reason why tempo is in my game abusive power you guys you
guys land here uh tempo go thunder and then i'll go get the

3725
02:54:51,980 --> 02:54:56,040
car i'll get the car over there this is the abusive power
man i'm gonna make sure that you're not getting landed on

3726
02:54:56,040 --> 02:55:00,860
though you're good you're good okay i'm letting everyone
here and now i'm gonna go up all right yeah we're good i'm

3727
02:55:00,860 --> 02:55:06,880
actually surprised they left oh my god i think they actually
you're serious that's done someone's gonna make a red post

3728
02:55:06,880 --> 02:55:14,000
about you i think what actually happened is i think they had
a worse game than us to be honest oh which is pretty tough

3729
02:55:14,000 --> 02:55:20,400
well we stole their car too so they're not really getting
anything out of it yeah they're just like they're just gonna

3730
02:55:20,400 --> 02:55:25,440
keep stealing our car we just might as well dip yeah i'm
literally taking the most important aspect of their gameplay

3731
02:55:25,440 --> 02:55:27,380
and just i gotta redeploy

3732
02:55:31,210 --> 02:55:35,790
so much so almost like i can't believe she got them a 4k
Yeah.

3733
02:55:37,030 --> 02:55:37,230
Yeah.

3734
02:55:37,530 --> 02:55:38,810
4k shitter is crazy awesome.

3735
02:55:40,230 --> 02:55:41,610
I love that out of you to be honest.

3736
02:55:44,770 --> 02:55:50,150
You can't if you have your 4k badge and you lose to my badge
right here with the fucking double bronze.

3737
02:55:50,330 --> 02:55:51,410

3738
02:55:51,750 --> 02:55:52,590
What are you doing?

3739
02:55:52,670 --> 02:55:56,410
I don't even have a 4k badge on this account with my
Bangalore.

3740
02:55:57,410 --> 02:55:58,490
That is so ridiculous.

3741
02:56:00,790 --> 02:56:01,970
All right, wait, is there a beacon for us to do?

3742
02:56:02,270 --> 02:56:02,950
No, there's not.

3743
02:56:05,490 --> 02:56:05,890
sucks.

3744
02:56:07,530 --> 02:56:09,810
We haven't had a single beacon here.

3745
02:56:10,730 --> 02:56:14,210
Yeah we have really bad luck when it comes to the really
important rounds to not get the really important stuff.

3746
02:56:14,910 --> 02:56:15,370
To be honest.

3747
02:56:15,490 --> 02:56:16,210
It's pretty sad.

3748
02:56:16,410 --> 02:56:16,830
I'm not going to that.

3749
02:56:16,930 --> 02:56:18,350
There's a really good at that.

3750
02:56:18,710 --> 02:56:20,470
Just not getting the things we need.

3751

I'm good.

3754
02:56:25,870 --> 02:56:27,610
There's no evo cash for me to take either.

3755
02:56:27,850 --> 02:56:28,910
Like this is fucking torch.

3756

3793
02:58:25,650 --> 02:58:27,630
I did not have a chance to get a lot of meds, though.

3794
02:58:28,150 --> 02:58:28,410
It's okay.

3795
02:58:28,510 --> 02:58:29,110
We don't really have most.

3796
02:58:29,190 --> 02:58:29,450
Yeah.

3797
02:58:29,590 --> 02:58:29,830
That's fine.

3798
02:58:30,050 --> 02:58:30,370
Good job.

3799
02:58:30,670 --> 02:58:31,690
We'll hit these Speekings, too.

3800
02:58:35,310 --> 02:58:36,370
extra meds anywhere.

3801
02:58:36,710 --> 02:58:38,050
I need like, I'm gonna try to find the last.

3802
02:58:38,590 --> 02:58:39,850
The last, let's go.

3803
02:58:40,490 --> 02:58:41,470
Not us.

3804
02:58:42,150 --> 02:58:42,450
We'll take it.

3805
02:58:42,530 --> 02:58:42,970
We'll take it.

3806
02:58:43,570 --> 02:58:44,730
Yeah, see a shield.

3807
02:58:44,770 --> 02:58:45,290
So let me know.

3808
02:58:45,590 --> 02:58:46,670
Hopefully, hopefully grab a bat.

3809
02:58:47,570 --> 02:58:48,990
Yeah, we should all craft the bat up for sure.

3810
02:58:50,950 --> 02:58:52,490
All right, I'm gonna craft a bat then.

3811
02:58:52,850 --> 02:58:53,910
Okay, they're on, they're on thunder.

3812
02:58:54,050 --> 02:58:54,490
They're on thunder.

3813
02:58:54,830 --> 02:58:55,170
That's fine.

3814
02:58:55,330 --> 02:58:55,990
I'm looking for him right now.

3815
02:58:59,070 --> 02:58:59,750
Kids are fucking idiots.

3816
02:59:00,450 --> 02:59:00,750
All right.

3817
02:59:01,230 --> 02:59:03,130
We probably can't hit the people scan, but craft the
battery.

3818
02:59:03,450 --> 02:59:04,810
I can like smoke it maybe.

3819
02:59:05,690 --> 02:59:06,810
Um, do it.

3820
02:59:09,350 --> 02:59:11,190
Yeah, they're running a far right.

3821
02:59:11,470 --> 02:59:11,790
We're good.

3822
02:59:11,910 --> 02:59:12,030
We're good.

3823
02:59:12,130 --> 02:59:14,190
Yeah, yeah, we should be able to now.

3824
02:59:15,270 --> 02:59:16,330
That's gonna be an echo HQ zone.

3825
02:59:18,690 --> 02:59:19,790
Yeah, they're running back there.

3826
02:59:20,450 --> 02:59:21,850
Oh, look at all these.

3827
02:59:22,530 --> 02:59:23,490

03:01:55,520 --> 03:01:55,740
Don't left.

3878
03:01:55,940 --> 03:01:56,100
We're good.

3879
03:01:56,480 --> 03:01:58,540
We should be close to us.

3880
03:01:58,600 --> 03:01:59,460
I heard something for sure.

3881
03:02:00,080 --> 03:02:01,000
I'm coming to you, Wade.

3882
03:02:01,160 --> 03:02:01,420
I hear him.

3883
03:02:01,420 --> 03:02:01,960
I hear him underneath it.

3884
03:02:02,020 --> 03:02:02,340
They're running away.

3885
03:02:02,420 --> 03:02:02,700
They're running away.

3886
03:02:02,700 --> 03:02:03,580
Okay, they are.

3887
03:02:03,900 --> 03:02:04,080
They are?

3888
03:02:04,080 --> 03:02:04,900
Yeah, you're good.

3889
03:02:04,980 --> 03:02:05,120
You're good.

3890
03:02:05,340 --> 03:02:06,120
I'm going to scan it.

3891
03:02:06,120 --> 03:02:08,200
Yeah, yeah, definitely scan it for sure.

3892
03:02:09,760 --> 03:02:10,860
Yeah, we might use your E-back tower.

3893
03:02:11,040 --> 03:02:12,140
I see them.

3894
03:02:12,800 --> 03:02:13,220
Little armor.

3895
03:02:14,140 --> 03:02:14,900
Yeah, they're a little armor.

3896
03:02:15,040 --> 03:02:15,380
Crack one?

3897
03:02:15,500 --> 03:02:15,980
She's on here too.

3898
03:02:17,280 --> 03:02:17,520
Hmm.

3899
03:02:18,220 --> 03:02:18,920
What is free?

3900
03:02:19,020 --> 03:02:20,500
Is there a player scan we can hit?

3901
03:02:20,660 --> 03:02:20,740
No.

3902
03:02:20,840 --> 03:02:21,860
We should just go over here and take a risk.

3903
03:02:21,940 --> 03:02:22,680
We're going to make a risk, okay?

3904
03:02:22,780 --> 03:02:23,060
All right.

3905
03:02:23,140 --> 03:02:24,040
I mean, we do have read a play.

3906
03:02:24,720 --> 03:02:25,760
Yeah, we're going to take a risk here.

3907
03:02:25,960 --> 03:02:27,580
I have no idea what's free, but we're going to find out.

3908
03:02:28,340 --> 03:02:29,060
19 squads up, though.

3909
03:02:29,100 --> 03:02:29,600
It's a little bit scary.

3910
03:02:29,720 --> 03:02:30,100
I can't lie.

3911
03:02:32,100 --> 03:02:32,420
All right.

3912
03:02:32,420 --> 03:02:32,700
You're good?

3913
03:02:33,020 --> 03:02:33,500
It's fine.

3914
03:02:33,620 --> 03:02:34,620
I could smoke us too.

3915
03:02:35,220 --> 03:02:35,700
Yeah, we should be good.

3916
03:02:35,800 --> 03:02:36,780
I don't think these guys will shoot us off.

3917
03:02:37,700 --> 03:02:39,440
Pretty stupid to waste their time doing this to us.

3918
03:02:40,500 --> 03:02:41,000
I'm ready.

3919
03:02:41,320 --> 03:02:42,180
Yeah, we're going to read a boy here.

3920
03:02:42,260 --> 03:02:43,600
I don't have one, so whenever you guys put it up.

3921
03:02:43,720 --> 03:02:44,100
Okay, ready?

3922
03:02:44,280 --> 03:02:45,180
All right, so wait, wait, wait, wait.

3923
03:02:45,760 --> 03:02:46,200
Yeah, yeah.

3924
03:02:46,200 --> 03:02:48,260
Okay, we're going to try to, we're going to try to land
something over here.

3925
03:02:48,680 --> 03:02:48,720
Okay.

3926
03:02:48,740 --> 03:02:49,620
Just follow my lead.

3927
03:02:49,720 --> 03:02:51,000
I have no idea what's for you and we're going to find out.

3928
03:02:51,560 --> 03:02:51,800
Yep.

3929
03:02:51,800 --> 03:02:52,780
We're going to find out.

3930
03:02:54,080 --> 03:02:54,620
Don't shoot me.

3931
03:02:54,620 --> 03:02:55,540
Wait, we can't go over this way.

3932
03:02:55,580 --> 03:02:55,920
It doesn't reach.

3933
03:02:56,100 --> 03:02:56,380
We're idiots.

3934
03:02:56,520 --> 03:02:56,920
Go this way.

3935
03:02:56,920 --> 03:03:06,140
ile go back down go back down go back down go back down go
straight back down yes right and then i'd rather wait for

3936
03:03:06,140 --> 03:03:17,580
the zone close and then we just play f9 one more time yes
yes for some reason i thought you could read a play over

3937
03:03:17,580 --> 03:03:28,220
there i swear to god i've watched people read a play i'm
just gonna wait for now i remember when We're doing hide and

3938

seek and then they they try to redeploy from there and it
didn't reach so one of the seekers died in zone Oh, really?

people fighting in the prowler section yeah that's actually
good though Yeah, because they're almost going to have to

3958
03:04:58,380 --> 03:04:59,260
come to us.

3959
03:04:59,500 --> 03:05:00,020
Yeah, that's fine.

3960
03:05:00,160 --> 03:05:02,480
I'm going to go down and get ready to scan.

3961
03:05:02,880 --> 03:05:03,380

3964
03:05:07,060 --> 03:05:07,540
I'll grab it.

3965
03:05:08,060 --> 03:05:08,580
Yeah, you're good.

3966
03:05:09,100 --> 03:05:09,420
Yeah, you're good.

3967
03:05:09,420 --> 03:05:10,220
Light ammo too if he has need.

3968
03:05:10,460 --> 03:05:10,700
I'm sure.

3969
03:05:11,420 --> 03:05:15,580
I'm looking at our east side still and also the north side a
little.

3970
03:05:15,840 --> 03:05:16,160
Okay.

3971
03:05:16,420 --> 03:05:17,900
The Wrangler alt at the north.

3972
03:05:18,480 --> 03:05:19,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3973
03:05:19,020 --> 03:05:19,960
I see them coming over.

3974
03:05:20,140 --> 03:05:20,940
They're starting to come over.

3975
03:05:21,260 --> 03:05:22,980
Yeah, they're definitely going to fight over there and just
come this way.

3976
03:05:23,100 --> 03:05:23,260
It's fine.

3977
03:05:23,360 --> 03:05:23,900
I think we just let them.

3978
03:05:24,020 --> 03:05:24,780
We can't get that quick enough.

3979
03:05:25,180 --> 03:05:26,640
All right, we see that sound, but I was straight echo.

3980
03:05:26,920 --> 03:05:27,920
100% are we going?

3981
03:05:28,400 --> 03:05:28,460
All right, definitely.

3982
03:05:28,640 --> 03:05:29,660
I need to go now for sure.

3983
03:05:29,880 --> 03:05:30,460
All right, I'm heading over.

3984
03:05:31,140 --> 03:05:32,480
We're going to back this way then.

3985
03:05:33,240 --> 03:05:34,260
Okay, we're going to evac around the mountain.

3986
03:05:34,520 --> 03:05:35,580
Evac around the brown tree.

3987
03:05:35,780 --> 03:05:36,720
Yeah, that's, that's what I was thinking.

3988
03:05:36,960 --> 03:05:37,120
Yeah, yeah.

3989
03:05:37,260 --> 03:05:38,620
We're gonna have to we're gonna have to this time.

3990
03:05:38,720 --> 03:05:39,860
I don't see anyone down below.

3991
03:05:40,040 --> 03:05:41,140
This is our last evac.

3992
03:05:41,460 --> 03:05:44,300
Well, I didn't see anyone here when you were looting the
pack.

3993
03:05:44,900 --> 03:05:45,140
Okay.

3994
03:05:46,420 --> 03:05:49,740
So I think so there's like this little corridor over here, I
want to try to get to.

3995
03:05:49,820 --> 03:05:50,320
You know what I'm talking about?

3996
03:05:50,380 --> 03:05:50,960
A little tunnel in there.

3997
03:05:51,060 --> 03:05:51,360
Yeah.

3998
03:05:51,700 --> 03:05:52,020
Yeah.

3999
03:05:52,180 --> 03:05:54,880
I want to try to land in that tunnel just put traps down and
smoke immediately.

4000
03:05:55,280 --> 03:05:55,600
Okay.

4001

It might there might be a team there, so I'm gonna find out
when we land in there Oh, they're shooting it back now, bro.

Yeah, no, that was our last one.

4011
03:06:17,960 --> 03:06:19,240
That's so bad for us.

I mean, we're technically Is there anyone is there anyone
over here?

4013
03:06:23,420 --> 03:06:25,000
I'm not sure our team just landed far right side.

03:06:49,680 --> 03:06:52,400
there's a team in pylon though they're gonna come over to
the side we're gonna have to try to kill these guys when

4019
03:06:52,400 --> 03:06:57,340
they rotate it okay really where i don't see them over here

4020
03:06:57,840 --> 03:06:58,940
They're gonna come this way though for sure.

4021
03:06:59,600 --> 03:07:01,200
I'll play down a little bit more and walk up to you guys.

4022
03:07:01,400 --> 03:07:03,760
I don't want these kids to get covered here.

4023
03:07:04,580 --> 03:07:05,120
Yeah, you're good, you're good.

4024
03:07:05,740 --> 03:07:06,380
They're gonna rotate over here.

4025
03:07:06,480 --> 03:07:07,360
They're gonna play just in pylon.

4026
03:07:08,300 --> 03:07:09,680
I saw one guy at least.

4027
03:07:09,840 --> 03:07:10,780
It might just be more than one.

4028
03:07:11,100 --> 03:07:11,920
But they're shooting your traps out right now.

4029
03:07:12,020 --> 03:07:12,380
They're top pylon.

4030
03:07:13,240 --> 03:07:14,700
I just hope I don't get shot from behind.

4031
03:07:14,760 --> 03:07:14,860
I see what I see.

4032
03:07:14,940 --> 03:07:15,560
They're running that's right.

4033
03:07:16,240 --> 03:07:16,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4034
03:07:18,800 --> 03:07:20,500
Yes, yes, yes.

4035
03:07:20,580 --> 03:07:21,060
We want to fight this.

4036
03:07:21,160 --> 03:07:21,900
We do not want these kids to live.

4037
03:07:22,500 --> 03:07:23,380
I'm looking now.

4038
03:07:23,660 --> 03:07:24,700
They just scanned Beacon?

4039
03:07:25,200 --> 03:07:25,460
That's fine.

4040
03:07:27,240 --> 03:07:33,880
so they're gonna rotate in on this right side temple you're
going out of zone by the way so yeah so that's enough we

4041
03:07:33,880 --> 03:07:38,160
need to try to get a knock when they cross right there
they're here yeah we're here yeah i see how much him i see

4042
03:07:38,160 --> 03:07:43,940
us too it's actually so bad for us just because this team on
the top canning could 100 rotate and kill us here yeah

4043
03:07:43,940 --> 03:07:51,620
they're on this box behind this car what color armor do you
know purple purple purple yeah okay we're gonna have to just

4044
03:07:51,620 --> 03:07:56,640
3v3 these guys i don't have an all-deep solar now um nope no
i don't This is so bad for us.

4045
03:07:56,840 --> 03:07:57,100
Fuck me.

4046
03:07:57,260 --> 03:07:58,320
I have all here, though.

4047
03:07:59,020 --> 03:07:59,520
Yeah, you're good.

4048
03:07:59,820 --> 03:08:00,480
Straight to the roof.

4049
03:08:02,720 --> 03:08:04,620
I think we just have to late rotate in the zone, boys.

4050
03:08:04,880 --> 03:08:05,360
I'm going to be honest.

4051
03:08:05,440 --> 03:08:05,900
I think we're just dying.

4052
03:08:05,940 --> 03:08:07,420
But they're getting shot at from another team.

4053
03:08:07,980 --> 03:08:08,740
Yeah, no team's holding them.

4054
03:08:09,000 --> 03:08:10,380
Yeah, another team shot them.

4055
03:08:11,000 --> 03:08:12,400
There's one guy behind that tree, though.

4056
03:08:12,480 --> 03:08:13,220
He's by himself.

4057
03:08:14,020 --> 03:08:14,280
Yep, yep.

4058
03:08:16,460 --> 03:08:17,500
Where's this other squad at?

4059
03:08:18,600 --> 03:08:20,120
Can we make it around the zone if we need to?

4060
03:08:20,400 --> 03:08:21,060
Yeah, we can.

4061
03:08:21,400 --> 03:08:23,860
I think we're going to have to, like, get late and just walk
in.

4062
03:08:23,980 --> 03:08:25,580
Hopefully all these guys just forgot about us, to be honest.

4063
03:08:26,700 --> 03:08:29,180
I don't know if they I think they finished the fight
already.

4064
03:08:29,280 --> 03:08:29,680
I don't know.

4065
03:08:29,760 --> 03:08:30,880
I don't know They're not shooting anymore.

4066
03:08:31,040 --> 03:08:31,860
They're not shooting each other.

4067
03:08:31,920 --> 03:08:32,540
I'm not sure.

4068
03:08:33,180 --> 03:08:34,740

Yeah, you're vibing.

4091
03:08:55,600 --> 03:09:07,820

sitting here man no way i'm getting ran off like this bro oh

4092
03:09:07,820 --> 03:09:14,680
my god if we have an evac this is not like playing valck man
we had three we had three evacs too that's the worst we are

4093
03:09:14,680 --> 03:09:21,680
we only used two what was the third one oh i'm not the day
yeah yeah yeah yeah they have an evac we should i think we

4094
03:09:21,680 --> 03:09:26,340
had the back here that was the corner well no they could
have got that they could have shot that out too they just

4095
03:09:26,340 --> 03:09:32,280
were too distracting on my loot box uh i just didn't expect
the team to be playing on the cannon right there man the

4096
03:09:32,280 --> 03:09:44,480
team no no no oh wait no wait unless oh they're dead yes
thank fucking god i hope you die honestly this is the team i

4097
03:09:44,480 --> 03:09:50,220
don't mind i wish to kind of live the other squads a bunch
of idiots all right so we got we got one point from that

4098
03:09:50,220 --> 03:09:59,480
though man oh my god look at all these needs jesus christ no
way no we're definitely we're definitely gonna play valke

4099
03:09:59,480 --> 03:10:06,600
though on world's edge okay okay we need some back up here
back there's in our chat swing

4100
03:11:22,040 --> 03:11:34,120
that's i'm back did you entertain our chat no what why not i
was commuted the whole time I'm so sad that team just played

4101
03:11:34,120 --> 03:11:40,520
cannon and shot an evac tower out instead of power toys and
rotate that's mind-blowing Yeah, and then they let the other

4102
03:11:40,520 --> 03:11:49,740
team behind us rotate Why can they rotate and not us they
had zero benefit of shooting our evac out?

4103
03:11:49,920 --> 03:11:54,600
They literally had nothing that was so dumb like fuck these
people I think we had more than one team shoot us because

4104
03:11:54,600 --> 03:11:56,160
the evac tower died so fast.

4105
03:11:56,420 --> 03:11:58,220
I was all three of them just shooting it.

4106
03:11:58,520 --> 03:12:04,140
Oh Which makes no sense because us evacking is better for
them like i don't understand why the fuck they're shooting

4107
03:12:04,140 --> 03:12:10,180
our evac out because they're like fuck that team and they
knew it was us they had what they actually said was what

4108
03:12:10,180 --> 03:12:13,540
shoot evac i have no idea how to play the game correctly i
think they said that

4109
03:12:20,260 --> 03:12:25,960
oh that's the specific words out of their mouth do we say
this is round two challenges i don't think anybody knows how

4110
03:12:25,960 --> 03:12:34,420
to play in during round two bro that's your wingman yeah it
is that's gun and he's whipping every shot he's missing

4111
03:12:34,420 --> 03:12:46,200
every shot with it my gosh bro bro i don't bro that's sad no
wonder he's still in challenger circuit damn yeah so are we

4112
03:12:46,200 --> 03:12:54,760
though so are we though guys so are we i mean we did i mean
we did die before them we did die before that first part is

4113
03:12:54,760 --> 03:13:03,180
we would have been so saving the spot i wanted to go to i'm
so sad every time every time that's just why Why we're

4114
03:13:03,180 --> 03:13:04,480
literally leaving your back.

4115
03:13:04,740 --> 03:13:06,100
Why do you not want us to rotate?

4116
03:13:06,420 --> 03:13:07,160
What are you doing?

4117
03:13:07,440 --> 03:13:10,840
They're like, what if we get that three extra KP though?

4118
03:13:11,840 --> 03:13:17,440
And they got literally none of it But like when it is when
it's all it's all about the possibilities

4119
03:13:21,740 --> 03:13:25,060
My chats got to the part where we fucked up our redeploy

4120
03:13:28,500 --> 03:13:32,840
I guess I'm just so easy you're still like fucking Valcoving
over the house.

4121
03:13:33,060 --> 03:13:36,960
Oh, there's no we were gonna i thought we were wrapping
around the mountain well to be fair we wouldn't have reached

4122
03:13:36,960 --> 03:13:41,800
the spot i wanted to if we had to wrap it on the mountain
side yeah but then we could have extra redeploy no we would

4123
03:13:41,800 --> 03:13:46,720
have fucking landed on somebody for sure i mean we could
have maybe we're made to work but yeah i thought we were

4124
03:13:46,720 --> 03:13:51,980
going around and i was i was like all right i'm ready to go
like halfway around and then i had to turn back to be fair

4125
03:13:51,980 --> 03:13:55,880
though there's just no world where that team would sure you
back out and i would just go past them we should have let

4126
03:13:55,880 --> 03:14:04,580
tempo be free and just see what happens we really need i
could i could have added to zone i could We should have let

4127
03:14:04,580 --> 03:14:06,100
him be free and just see what happens.

4128
03:14:06,380 --> 03:14:07,620
I would be in a tree right now.

4129
03:14:14,530 --> 03:14:15,250
Spit it.

4130
03:14:15,350 --> 03:14:18,150
Man, he should have climbed up a tree and then we would have
been top five.

4131
03:14:18,310 --> 03:14:19,230
That could have been us.

4132
03:14:20,110 --> 03:14:23,330
Like all these teams were fighting and then we were in that
top five.

4133
03:14:23,490 --> 03:14:25,130
Oh, these are an all-volar team.

4134
03:14:25,410 --> 03:14:25,610
What?

4135
03:14:25,970 --> 03:14:28,630
This is what we're in right now is actually exactly right
next to I want to go.

4136
03:14:28,710 --> 03:14:29,930
I'm so sad, man.

4137
03:14:30,190 --> 03:14:31,390
Oh, that could have been us.

4138
03:14:32,050 --> 03:14:32,670
I'm so...

4139
03:14:32,670 --> 03:14:33,590
I could have been us.

4140
03:14:35,170 --> 03:14:36,150
That could have been us.

4141
03:14:36,310 --> 03:14:37,210
I could have been us.

4142
03:14:40,690 --> 03:14:41,870
I'm so sad.

4143
03:14:43,630 --> 03:14:45,150
It's a horrible cat wall too.

4144
03:14:45,210 --> 03:14:46,090
What the fuck are we doing?

4145
03:14:47,590 --> 03:14:48,910
What if why is he playing cat?

4146
03:14:48,990 --> 03:14:49,690
Is cat metal?

4147
03:14:50,730 --> 03:14:51,710
Cat's on bad right now.

4148
03:14:52,190 --> 03:14:52,470
It's alright.

4149
03:14:52,810 --> 03:14:53,910
I don't know what's meta.

4150
03:15:00,430 --> 03:15:01,310
Oh, fish so dead.

4151
03:15:01,610 --> 03:15:03,050
Yeah, I don't think they're gonna live this.

4152
03:15:03,650 --> 03:15:04,290
Yeah, they're definitely not.

4153
03:15:04,850 --> 03:15:07,250
Yeah, they're definitely, that team definitely is not first.

4154
03:15:08,050 --> 03:15:08,450
GG's.

4155
03:15:08,770 --> 03:15:08,990
Yeah!

4156
03:15:09,330 --> 03:15:09,870
We're not second though.

4157
03:15:11,350 --> 03:15:12,250
Oh, man.

4158
03:15:12,790 --> 03:15:13,530
Love that for us.

4159
03:15:13,750 --> 03:15:14,630
We're doing it.

4160
03:15:15,370 --> 03:15:16,190
The one point.

4161
03:15:17,090 --> 03:15:18,450
We can pretend to be that team.

4162
03:15:19,190 --> 03:15:19,490
True.

4163
03:15:19,710 --> 03:15:19,970
Spent.

4164
03:15:23,130 --> 03:15:23,850
Spent and spend.

4165
03:15:24,210 --> 03:15:26,130
We are going to be.

4166
03:15:26,290 --> 03:15:27,250
We're going to be like 15th probably.

4167
03:15:27,410 --> 03:15:28,270
Probably in.

4168
03:15:28,690 --> 03:15:28,950
Yeah.

4169
03:15:28,950 --> 03:15:29,590
15th, 16th.

4170
03:15:29,630 --> 03:15:30,650
Yeah, somewhere around there.

4171
03:15:30,970 --> 03:15:31,950
Yeah, without a doubt.

4172
03:15:32,250 --> 03:15:33,190
Yeah, 100%.

4173
03:15:33,190 --> 03:15:36,170
We should really only be like five points ahead, so.

4174
03:15:36,530 --> 03:15:36,890
Yeah.

4175
03:15:37,170 --> 03:15:39,690
We just need a good last two games.

4176
03:15:39,750 --> 03:15:41,230
We just need to get to zone, bro.

4177
03:15:41,250 --> 03:15:47,030
Yeah, we need to be at the hardest thing about challenge
circuit is all the dumbasses that play edge That's the

4178
03:15:47,030 --> 03:15:47,630
hardest thing.

4179
03:15:48,310 --> 03:15:48,870
Yeah, a lot.

4180
03:15:48,930 --> 03:15:50,890
There's a lot of teams play edge in this one.

4181
03:15:51,510 --> 03:16:03,070
I think I left my team All right, I am waiting for this
person I don't know who this person I'm always worried I

4182
03:16:03,070 --> 03:16:09,790
accidentally rejected somebody to actually know because so
many people just randomly add me And like I don't reject I

4183
03:16:09,790 --> 03:16:16,070
just straight up block I blocked so much.

4184
03:16:16,330 --> 03:16:17,530
I blocked 100% friends.

4185
03:16:17,770 --> 03:16:18,990
Without a doubt, I definitely blocked friends.

4186
03:16:19,070 --> 03:16:23,670
I think somebody who was in my team for one of the
tournaments added me.

4187
03:16:23,970 --> 03:16:25,450
But I was like, who is this fucker?

4188
03:16:25,510 --> 03:16:26,550
And then I actually blocked.

4189
03:16:27,490 --> 03:16:30,810
And after I blocked them, I was like, wait, they were on my
team.

4190
03:16:31,370 --> 03:16:32,170
That's so funny.

4191
03:16:33,250 --> 03:16:34,070
That is so ridiculous.

4192
03:16:35,030 --> 03:16:35,430
All right.

4193
03:16:35,570 --> 03:16:37,030
We are, yep, exactly.

4194
03:16:37,890 --> 03:16:38,370
14.

4195
03:16:39,550 --> 03:16:41,150
And 10th is 4.

4196
03:16:41,250 --> 03:16:47,770
away from us exactly exactly what we thought we'd have
playing i'm playing i'm up world such i'm playing uh okay

4197
03:16:47,770 --> 03:16:56,470
okay not bloodhound i blood yeah yeah okay let me make sure
my banner represents correctly what i am as a player so i'm

4198
03:16:56,470 --> 03:17:02,850
gonna be honest where are we going on this map we don't even
know right yeah we'll figure it out don't even know oh the

4199
03:17:02,850 --> 03:17:12,230
badges we'll just type we'll just type ciphon to start with
the badges aren't fixed yet i will guarantee those No, we

4200
03:17:12,230 --> 03:17:13,530
can just, I can just type the thing again.

4201
03:17:13,710 --> 03:17:16,950
You won't play, you won't get invited to any tournaments.

4202
03:17:17,570 --> 03:17:18,030
That's cool.

4203
03:17:18,230 --> 03:17:18,550
That's good.

4204
03:17:18,710 --> 03:17:19,050
That's good.

4205
03:17:19,210 --> 03:17:19,950
It always works.

4206
03:17:20,230 --> 03:17:20,990
Feds always work.

4207
03:17:24,130 --> 03:17:24,690
That's good.

4208
03:17:24,990 --> 03:17:25,810
Threatening other people.

4209
03:17:26,030 --> 03:17:26,950
That's a good thing to do.

4210
03:17:27,750 --> 03:17:27,970
Yeah.

4211
03:17:29,370 --> 03:17:30,830
Are we good people, guys?

4212
03:17:31,030 --> 03:17:31,350
Let's start threatening more.

4213
03:17:31,590 --> 03:17:31,870
Yes.

4214
03:17:32,010 --> 03:17:32,510

Wait, what about me?

Yeah, maybe.

4223
03:17:40,050 --> 03:17:41,230
Maybe not you, but yes.

4224
03:17:41,250 --> 03:17:48,590
what what did i do it's got to be nicer man yeah wait you

4226
03:17:59,270 --> 03:18:18,400

someone's signing tissue tissue yay so far so good i believe

4227
03:18:18,400 --> 03:18:22,180
in us i always do

4228
03:18:27,490 --> 03:18:35,650
all righty what's the worst that could happen i mean we
should i think we're i think we might be free here i'm not

4229
03:18:35,650 --> 03:18:41,990
sure yeah we'll see not free though there's nowhere we can
really swerve that's the only problem we can swerve tree is

4230
03:18:41,990 --> 03:18:46,090
still open tree and harvester are still open i'm

4231
03:18:51,780 --> 03:18:58,400
crossing off as i see people post stuff is it still open yep
yay

4232
03:19:04,020 --> 03:19:13,000
okay we got this yeah we can we can we can still just in
case we can still swerve harvester and treat that's fair i'm

4233
03:19:13,000 --> 03:19:22,060
down for that actually that's pretty good we got this i
believe i totally believe in us this is this is where we got

4234
03:19:22,060 --> 03:19:34,540
all of our points yeah yeah yeah exactly world's edge is
where we got a lot of our points this is it which okay

4235
03:19:40,800 --> 03:19:46,260
so lava siphon and we swerved a tree it wouldn't be that bad
we can make that work we just really need to focus on

4236
03:19:46,260 --> 03:19:50,900
getting this fucking into zone We're literally just
guaranteed to fucking call just need a beacon.

4237
03:19:51,700 --> 03:19:56,380
It's just it's just avoiding the bullshit, man It's it's so
hard for us to do that sometimes and that situation We 100%

4238
03:19:56,380 --> 03:20:00,620
could have we had a Val can we get in the zone and probably
get top five But it's really fucking hard when the evax is

4239
03:20:00,620 --> 03:20:02,120
getting shot out for no reason that situation.

4240
03:20:02,320 --> 03:20:11,400
Yeah That's a lows We're better at world's edge than we are
on That we're a world's edge storm point.

4241
03:20:11,520 --> 03:20:12,580
Yeah, we're a world's edge team.

4242
03:20:12,720 --> 03:20:13,240
That's us.

4243
03:20:13,720 --> 03:20:21,320
We'll never we'll never figure out storm point But that's
okay all right for some reason we're a world-side squad

4244
03:20:21,320 --> 03:20:23,500
we're a world-side squad that's us

4245
03:20:26,720 --> 03:20:31,540
i love these guys are talking about these guys are talking
about fucking rainbow six dude bro i don't think they're

be better this time to the floor Are we supposed to be

4252
03:21:02,420 --> 03:21:04,820
better gamers this time around?

4253
03:21:05,620 --> 03:21:08,560
Uh, no, we're doing good.

03:21:08,660 --> 03:21:09,240
We're doing good.

4255
03:21:10,040 --> 03:21:11,760
We're actually in a pretty good.

4256
03:21:11,880 --> 03:21:15,160
We just got top 15 both games in a row That's pretty good
actually last week.

4257
03:21:15,220 --> 03:21:24,440
We got like 19th in the second game and then like 19th again
I think and then the last game we also got 19th last game

4258
03:21:24,440 --> 03:21:32,500
last week no okay no last week we got two games where where
we didn't place very well but we still got top 12 yeah yeah

4259
03:21:32,500 --> 03:21:38,780
until last game too we're good we're in a better we're in a
better streak already i thought we're 14th right now yep

4260
03:21:38,780 --> 03:21:44,640
yeah which is better but through two games last week we were
not at 14 we were at 14th only because of one game though oh

4261
03:21:44,640 --> 03:21:54,320
yeah yeah yeah we got second place and then we got like 19th
19th 19th okay we just need to repeat that we need to repeat

4262
03:21:54,320 --> 03:22:02,800
that exact scenario we need to go find our v we need to find
an rv guys guys yes you're understanding a little bit this

4263
03:22:02,800 --> 03:22:08,200
is good yes yeah yeah we figured it out where no one can
shoot us because we don't have the firepower for this

4264
03:22:08,200 --> 03:22:13,440
exactly we're a strategic team we're not a shooting team let
me let me go plug in evan's Hello.

4265
03:22:14,200 --> 03:22:15,720
Wait, what are you trying to say about his controller, bro?

You're plugging the house controller so you can get to the
store.

4269
03:22:24,840 --> 03:22:27,340
There's a special thing on there, you know?

4270
03:22:27,520 --> 03:22:28,500
Yeah, on the back of it.

4271
03:22:28,860 --> 03:22:29,080
Yeah.

4272
03:22:29,620 --> 03:22:31,680
I thought it was a rumble pack, but it wasn't.

4273
03:22:31,900 --> 03:22:33,440
He downloaded a program for it or what?

4274

All right.

4275
03:22:35,080 --> 03:22:35,620
Don't worry.

4276
03:22:35,680 --> 03:22:36,900
I'm ready for Bloodhound.

4277
03:22:37,920 --> 03:22:38,140
All right.

4278
03:22:38,260 --> 03:22:41,220
So siphon into tree or harvester if we need to spread.

4279
03:22:41,980 --> 03:22:42,340
Bro.

4280
03:22:42,900 --> 03:22:45,120
I can't believe my ring badge is still not back yet.

4281
03:22:45,120 --> 03:22:46,200
Or do we just contest Siphon?

4282
03:22:46,840 --> 03:22:47,080
You know?

4283
03:22:48,040 --> 03:22:48,780
TSM buff?

4284
03:22:49,060 --> 03:22:50,260
We have the TSM buff.

4285
03:22:50,580 --> 03:22:51,620
We contest Siphon, we win.

4286
03:22:51,860 --> 03:22:54,860
No, I don't think I want to do that.

4287
03:22:54,980 --> 03:22:57,020
I don't think I want...

4288
03:22:57,880 --> 03:23:00,500
Because I don't know if I want to contest anybody.

4289
03:23:01,480 --> 03:23:03,060
Why do we not have Beacon again?

4290
03:23:03,140 --> 03:23:03,900
I don't know.

4291
03:23:04,960 --> 03:23:06,500
Okay, so if we need...

4292
03:23:06,500 --> 03:23:08,840
If someone is going Siphon and we need to swerve...

4293
03:23:08,840 --> 03:23:09,380
I want to kill Tree.

4294
03:23:09,500 --> 03:23:09,940
Just kill Tree.

4295
03:23:10,360 --> 03:23:11,380
Tree has Beacon and everything.

4296
03:23:11,460 --> 03:23:12,120
Yeah, Tree has Beacons.

4297
03:23:13,120 --> 03:23:14,220
Someone's going tree.

4298
03:23:14,620 --> 03:23:15,240
I think there is.

4299
03:23:15,300 --> 03:23:15,540
Okay.

4300
03:23:15,920 --> 03:23:16,380
Is there?

4301
03:23:16,400 --> 03:23:17,640
No, there's no one here.

4302
03:23:17,680 --> 03:23:17,820
Okay.

4303
03:23:18,160 --> 03:23:19,280
I'm going to loot at the bottom.

4304
03:23:19,420 --> 03:23:20,660
Wait, actually, no, I should loot here.

4305
03:23:21,320 --> 03:23:23,180
I have to go loot the center because of the thing.

4306
03:23:23,480 --> 03:23:23,860
I'll loot the bottom.

4307
03:23:24,060 --> 03:23:24,580
I got bottom.

4308
03:23:24,780 --> 03:23:25,300
I got bottom.

4309
03:23:26,320 --> 03:23:26,640
Great.

4310
03:23:27,780 --> 03:23:31,180
Yo, I bet you no one went siphoned because they thought we
were going there.

4311
03:23:31,380 --> 03:23:32,200
I'm going to rotate through that.

4312
03:23:32,320 --> 03:23:32,540
That's fine.

4313
03:23:32,720 --> 03:23:33,640
Also, fuck them.

4314
03:23:33,760 --> 03:23:34,360
They don't get the damage.

4315
03:23:34,620 --> 03:23:35,060
I can do loot.

4316
03:23:35,200 --> 03:23:36,240
And nobody gets siphoned.

4317
03:23:36,480 --> 03:23:37,420
We're looting two POIs.

4318
03:23:38,040 --> 03:23:38,200
Yeah.

4319
03:23:38,500 --> 03:23:38,820
Oh, wait.

4320
03:23:38,940 --> 03:23:39,280
There's no point.

4321
03:23:39,360 --> 03:23:40,060
Streamer advantage.

4322
03:23:41,140 --> 03:23:41,960
Don't scan until it's done.

4323
03:23:43,500 --> 03:23:48,820
it's fine i'd actually rather just land tree anyway because
the beacons dude i'm not going to go lava siphon with no

4324
03:23:48,820 --> 03:23:54,080
beacon it's useless to us what is our luck though landing
lava siphon not getting a beacon why is your round two worse

4325
03:23:54,080 --> 03:24:01,120
than why our luck should be better round two than round one
never we actually have the worst round fucking the worst

4326
03:24:01,120 --> 03:24:12,460
round two ever and my loot is fucking awful oh my god devo

I want to get to Zone.

4406
03:28:26,580 --> 03:28:27,740
We're not gonna be able to get this zone from here.

4443
03:29:47,680 --> 03:29:48,440
They can 100% creep up.

4444
03:29:50,060 --> 03:29:51,220
Just play from here and we can evat.

4445

4447
03:29:53,580 --> 03:29:59,260

We hold these kids out no matter what that's for sure.

4453
03:30:25,540 --> 03:30:26,780
Wait, someone just hit a beacon.

4454
03:30:27,500 --> 03:30:28,140
How was that noise?

4455
03:30:28,300 --> 03:30:29,060
Someone just hit a ring console.

03:30:29,720 --> 03:30:30,460
Right here, what the fuck?

4457
03:30:31,140 --> 03:30:32,860
Wait, what the fuck?

Is he just in the open?

4459
03:30:34,500 --> 03:30:35,680
I don't know, he just hit a ring.

4460
03:30:35,760 --> 03:30:37,420
I just heard a ring console and a guy in front of me.

4461
03:30:37,560 --> 03:30:39,380
Careful temple where we backed up.

4462
03:30:39,820 --> 03:30:40,780
Blue armor, by the way.

4463
03:30:41,580 --> 03:30:42,740
Yeah, I don't know what the fuck that was.

4464
03:30:42,880 --> 03:30:44,740
I just heard a ring console and then that guy was in front
of me.

4465
03:30:45,460 --> 03:30:45,720
What?

4466
03:30:45,740 --> 03:30:47,140
What about a bug?

4467
03:30:48,280 --> 03:30:48,720
Yeah, you're good.

4468
03:30:49,940 --> 03:30:51,300
They're going through blue bit and we're fine.

4469
03:30:52,140 --> 03:30:52,180
Okay.

4470
03:30:52,840 --> 03:30:53,840
They're leaving us.

4471
03:30:54,620 --> 03:30:55,440
Are you still looking?

4472
03:30:55,520 --> 03:30:55,560
Okay.

4473
03:30:55,700 --> 03:30:56,540
You're still looking behind.

4474
03:30:58,360 --> 03:30:59,120
I see them.

4475
03:30:59,220 --> 03:30:59,320
Yeah.

4476
03:30:59,700 --> 03:31:01,080
I'm currently trying to fight us real quick.

4477
03:31:01,880 --> 03:31:03,520
Where the fuck is the spot you're trying to play, buddy?

4478

Leave us.

4480
03:31:05,720 --> 03:31:06,200
We're content.

4481
03:31:07,740 --> 03:31:08,940
I don't know why they're trying to hold you.

4482
03:31:09,020 --> 03:31:10,120
The spot's so bad.

4483
03:31:10,640 --> 03:31:12,620
Once they have the, unless they think the sound is on.

4484
03:31:12,640 --> 03:31:13,400
Remember, this is round three.

4485
03:31:13,820 --> 03:31:14,920
Oh my God.

4486
03:31:15,040 --> 03:31:15,140
Okay.

Temple, just hide in there.

4502

There's another team is pushing forward, too.

Just hide.

You don't exist.

4505
03:32:03,320 --> 03:32:04,440
You don't exist.

4506
03:32:05,080 --> 03:32:06,860
Why did we get creeped?

03:32:12,830 --> 03:32:14,970
No, genuinely, what the fuck am I playing, bro?

4508

Oh, my God.

4509
03:32:16,370 --> 03:32:16,690
I don't

4510
03:32:20,070 --> 03:32:20,330
know.

4511
03:32:20,710 --> 03:32:21,770
It's another time for it.

4512
03:32:21,810 --> 03:32:23,710
These kids are so fucking bad, man.

4513
03:32:23,890 --> 03:32:26,050
Bro, just stay in the house.

4514
03:32:26,170 --> 03:32:27,350
That's your home now, Tempo.

4515
03:32:27,890 --> 03:32:29,330
Oh, my God, bro.

4516
03:32:29,370 --> 03:32:30,070
This is the shit.

4517
03:32:30,090 --> 03:32:31,550
That tells me and just don't pay too much.

4518
03:32:31,770 --> 03:32:32,890
Oh my God.

4519
03:32:33,250 --> 03:32:33,950
I'm safe.

4520
03:32:34,730 --> 03:32:35,030
Don't worry, guys.

4521
03:32:35,150 --> 03:32:35,930
I can get your banner.

4522
03:32:36,170 --> 03:32:38,530
I can get your banner and then Evac Tower.

4523
03:32:39,770 --> 03:32:41,110
Banner, Evac, and I'm good.

4524
03:32:42,030 --> 03:32:43,170
And I have a Moby right here.

4525
03:32:43,550 --> 03:32:44,490
Just get us one point.

4526
03:32:44,770 --> 03:32:46,390
Just get us one point.

4527
03:32:47,110 --> 03:32:49,230
I actually cannot believe what I'm talking about.

4528
03:32:49,570 --> 03:32:52,570
How was that team able to push from Blue Bins?

4529
03:32:52,750 --> 03:32:54,130
Why are they pushing from Blue Bins?

4530
03:32:54,350 --> 03:32:55,270
What are you doing?

4531
03:32:55,810 --> 03:32:59,030
These are why these kids stay hard to challenge a circuit
for 98 years.

4532
03:33:00,150 --> 03:33:01,130
Holy fuck dude.

4533
03:33:01,130 --> 03:33:01,570
I agree.

4534
03:33:01,730 --> 03:33:02,130
98.

4535
03:33:02,610 --> 03:33:04,190
Oh my god.

4536
03:33:04,510 --> 03:33:07,190
Oh my god.

4537
03:33:07,210 --> 03:33:09,010
How is this possible?

4538
03:33:09,890 --> 03:33:12,510
Why in one world are they able to push up like that?

4539
03:33:12,630 --> 03:33:13,490
That is crazy.

4540
03:33:13,770 --> 03:33:13,830
Tempo.

4541
03:33:13,950 --> 03:33:15,790
Is that P20 I see in your hand?

4542
03:33:16,430 --> 03:33:16,610
Yeah.

4543
03:33:16,810 --> 03:33:17,670
Yeah, I was looking for a re.

4544
03:33:20,130 --> 03:33:21,350
No, I have hammer points.

4545
03:33:21,630 --> 03:33:21,930
It's okay.

4546
03:33:22,050 --> 03:33:22,430
I believe.

4547
03:33:22,570 --> 03:33:22,910
I believe.

4548
03:33:22,970 --> 03:33:24,110
No one's gonna go in your house.

4549
03:33:24,710 --> 03:33:25,870
There's no way.

4550
03:33:26,890 --> 03:33:27,630
Just stay there.

4551
03:33:27,750 --> 03:33:30,070
Don't even fucking get out of, don't even leave.

4552
03:33:30,090 --> 03:33:31,110
You just stayed.

4553
03:33:31,230 --> 03:33:31,870
There's no way.

4554
03:33:31,890 --> 03:33:32,330
Oh my god.

4555
03:33:32,470 --> 03:33:33,450
It's pulls right on top.

4556
03:33:34,570 --> 03:33:35,310
Does it pull on the choke?

4557
03:33:35,930 --> 03:33:36,550
Oh my god.

4558
03:33:36,710 --> 03:33:37,330
It does, bro.

4559
03:33:37,690 --> 03:33:38,470
It pulls out here.

4560
03:33:38,690 --> 03:33:40,430
And we just got grief so hard.

4561
03:33:40,510 --> 03:33:43,010
You know, you know, you know the old zone with the pills and
shit?

4562
03:33:43,150 --> 03:33:43,390
Yeah.

4563
03:33:43,730 --> 03:33:43,930
Exactly.

4564
03:33:44,650 --> 03:33:44,690
Yeah.

4565
03:33:44,830 --> 03:33:45,650
So it's going to be the blue bench one.

4566
03:33:46,170 --> 03:33:47,110
We literally called it perfectly.

4567
03:33:47,350 --> 03:33:49,030
And we just got grief from two fucking.

4568
03:33:49,610 --> 03:33:50,810
Oh my god.

4569
03:33:50,910 --> 03:33:52,730
We got grief so hard.

4570
03:33:52,750 --> 03:33:53,410
All right, guys.

4571
03:33:53,690 --> 03:33:54,770
I think it was a nade.

They saw you got nade in.

4573
03:33:56,170 --> 03:33:56,930
They're like, this is it.

4574
03:33:57,230 --> 03:33:58,090
This is it.

4575
03:33:58,530 --> 03:34:00,070
It's just in any good lobby.

03:34:00,090 --> 03:34:07,570
that team just cannot move they just cannot push from blue
bits like it doesn't mean yeah they got grief for that let's

4611
03:36:28,990 --> 03:36:30,210
Yeah, they're so stressed out.

4612
03:36:30,330 --> 03:36:31,330
These guys are running past.

4613
03:36:31,530 --> 03:36:32,470
You need ultis.

4614
03:36:32,470 --> 03:36:32,830
You need ultis.

4615
03:36:32,930 --> 03:36:33,950
You need to stay alive for top 12.

4616
03:36:34,090 --> 03:36:34,350
I don't know.

4617
03:36:34,770 --> 03:36:35,950
I think they're running past.

4618
03:36:36,530 --> 03:36:38,310
Um, they are not running past.

4619
03:36:38,490 --> 03:36:39,330
They are not running past.

4620
03:36:39,650 --> 03:36:40,230
They want that.

4621
03:36:40,230 --> 03:36:40,890
Oh, you bitch.

4622
03:36:41,330 --> 03:36:41,690
Yeah.

4623
03:36:41,790 --> 03:36:42,270
Fuck them up.

4624
03:36:42,330 --> 03:36:43,270

you here.

4633
03:37:46,470 --> 03:37:50,610
We got one team came up here, two teams came up here, and
then we just got fucking full-time.

4634
03:37:50,610 --> 03:37:51,450
That could have been you.

4635
03:37:52,230 --> 03:37:53,610
They stole your team back.

4636
03:37:53,630 --> 03:37:56,710
I think you're a really good spot where they landed, but I'm
not gonna lie, that's a good job.

4637
03:37:56,890 --> 03:37:58,250
That one could have been us, man.

4638
03:37:58,330 --> 03:37:59,730
That could have been fucking tempo.

4639
03:38:02,030 --> 03:38:02,970
We got top 10.

4640
03:38:03,070 --> 03:38:04,330
Was that two points for top 10?

4641
03:38:05,610 --> 03:38:06,390
I think so.

4642
03:38:06,770 --> 03:38:07,130
Nice.

4643
03:38:07,130 --> 03:38:08,070
We got plus 2.

4644
03:38:08,170 --> 03:38:09,210
Okay, last game, guys.

4645
03:38:09,290 --> 03:38:11,150
We need to have a really good game.

4646
03:38:11,190 --> 03:38:12,430
Yeah, that's for damn sure.

4647
03:38:12,930 --> 03:38:14,750
Or I don't think we're making it.

4648
03:38:15,450 --> 03:38:22,150
not going to get griefed in round two or what the fuck going
on our round two is never lucky we're lucky in round one the

4649
03:38:22,150 --> 03:38:31,010
fucking round that never matters like this is bullshit this
is bullshit dude it's that i call for a recount i demand a

4650
03:38:31,010 --> 03:38:38,290
revote yeah i would demand this particular game to be reset
i agree i think they i think they bring us back to the exact

4651
03:38:38,290 --> 03:38:44,710
same circle restart the game we go from there yeah yeah yeah
that's the only fair way to put you not want more content

4652
03:38:44,710 --> 03:38:48,310
We're literally boosting the Challenger Circuit views right
now

4653
03:38:52,750 --> 03:39:00,690
It's so crazy to say You guys like I Why do you want the
content to be good?

4654
03:39:00,970 --> 03:39:07,110
I bet you I have the most viewers on YouTube right now for
Challenger Circuit You need me for the YouTube

4655
03:39:07,110 --> 03:39:19,190
representation We need me for the viewership Come on Come
on, Tees, you gotta let us, we have to, we're here to save

4656
03:39:19,190 --> 03:39:19,630
Apex.

4657
03:39:19,910 --> 03:39:21,830
So we can go Siphon, by the way.

4658
03:39:22,350 --> 03:39:25,170
Yeah, I mean, yeah, we can, but if there's no beacon, I
don't even wanna go there.

4659
03:39:25,790 --> 03:39:26,770
That's true, all right.

4660
03:39:27,110 --> 03:39:27,350
Okay.

4661
03:39:27,490 --> 03:39:29,230
So we've got two POIs.

4662
03:39:29,230 --> 03:39:30,610
Yeah, we have two POIs.

4663
03:39:30,710 --> 03:39:31,810
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4664
03:39:32,550 --> 03:39:34,630
Realistically, this last game should be good for us.

4665
03:39:35,250 --> 03:39:39,090
All I'm saying, let us through the round three and we'll
give you more content.

4666
03:39:39,730 --> 03:39:41,510
Best case scenario, we're in 12.

4667
03:39:42,590 --> 03:39:44,470
Okay, that's definitely not gonna happen for sure.

4668
03:39:44,710 --> 03:39:50,970
gonna happen we will probably stay in 14 which means we need
like a 10 point game okay all right that's all right which

4669
03:39:50,970 --> 03:39:58,990
is doable that's that's second place and one kill that's
easy oh oh i you saw that conduit oh and then oh and then he

4670
03:39:58,990 --> 03:40:04,250
he still hit himself oh my god oh no

4671
03:40:07,890 --> 03:40:15,770
bro this guy's a 4k badge what the bro what the am i
watching oh yo you You know what I should have done?

4672
03:40:16,170 --> 03:40:19,250
I should have when that team was coming in, I should have
given them the evac.

4673
03:40:20,170 --> 03:40:20,890
Yeah, they would have left.

4674
03:40:21,310 --> 03:40:23,910
And then they would have left and now I would have been
like, all right, see you guys.

4675
03:40:24,370 --> 03:40:25,710
Yeah, but then you would have just died on the walk up.

4676
03:40:25,890 --> 03:40:27,230
Yeah, you would die on the walk.

4677
03:40:27,290 --> 03:40:28,090
I'm not going to lie.

4678
03:40:28,230 --> 03:40:29,150
You needed that evac.

4679
03:40:30,430 --> 03:40:31,730
Oh, no, no, I take it after them.

4680
03:40:31,850 --> 03:40:33,990
I pretend like we're four people on a team.

4681
03:40:34,810 --> 03:40:35,670
I should have colluded.

4682
03:40:35,970 --> 03:40:36,870
I feel like you'd be the one.

4683
03:40:36,890 --> 03:40:39,030
Yeah, we should have all four of us should have taken the
balloon.

4684
03:40:39,250 --> 03:40:42,750
I should have just thrown it out for them and then been
like, truest.

4685
03:40:43,270 --> 03:40:47,450
Yeah, but I think they just threw it out for them they the
other team would have shot the evac because there was there

4686
03:40:47,450 --> 03:40:53,090
was there was no way they would have fucking not shot it
yeah it would have been a truce what do you mean no i meant

4687
03:40:53,090 --> 03:41:00,290
the other team the other other team yeah but then they would
see four of us and get scared well no they'll see the evac

4688
03:41:00,290 --> 03:41:17,230
tower and shoot it down like what i'm confused okay jesus
this is it oh my god I'm so watching that conduit do some

4689
03:41:17,230 --> 03:41:18,070
amazing things.

4690
03:41:20,970 --> 03:41:21,930
Conduit 838326.

4691
03:41:22,490 --> 03:41:25,150
Guys, I thought that we're a world's edge team.

4692
03:41:25,290 --> 03:41:26,210
What happened to us?

4693
03:41:26,430 --> 03:41:27,010
We used to be...

4694
03:41:27,010 --> 03:41:28,530
I mean, we just got grief, guys.

4695
03:41:28,710 --> 03:41:29,550
We used to be such a good team.

4696
03:41:29,550 --> 03:41:31,070
Teams around us have no brain cells.

4697
03:41:31,350 --> 03:41:32,650
I called the zone perfectly.

4698
03:41:32,970 --> 03:41:34,730
I literally knew exactly where it was going.

4699
03:41:35,110 --> 03:41:40,470
And we had Geyser Choke doing a fucking team jerkoff instead
of fucking shooting the squad.

4700
03:41:41,390 --> 03:41:43,030
We should have been in the house.

4701
03:41:43,570 --> 03:41:44,290
It's true.

4702
03:41:44,610 --> 03:41:45,910
Temmix was probably through the roof for them, though, bro.

4703
03:41:45,970 --> 03:41:46,510
I'm going to be honest.

4704
03:41:48,270 --> 03:41:54,130
If that team that was on those boxes, the blue bins, lived,
I swear to God, I'd be so sad.

4705
03:41:54,170 --> 03:41:54,750
I'm pretty sure they did.

4706
03:41:55,150 --> 03:41:55,770
They did?

4707
03:41:55,970 --> 03:41:56,130
No.

4708
03:41:57,950 --> 03:41:59,410
Geyser Choke did nothing.

4709
03:41:59,570 --> 03:42:00,310
Those guys were awful.

4710
03:42:00,330 --> 03:42:01,310
Yeah, Geyser didn't do anything.

4711
03:42:01,770 --> 03:42:04,470
Yeah, but I'm thinking like the other team behind them.

4712
03:42:04,810 --> 03:42:05,570
That's what you would think.

4713
03:42:05,630 --> 03:42:05,970
For sure.

4714
03:42:06,030 --> 03:42:06,650
No, for sure.

4715
03:42:06,730 --> 03:42:07,290
They just don't.

4716
03:42:07,570 --> 03:42:08,230
They don't know what they're doing.

4717
03:42:08,530 --> 03:42:09,390
Yeah, that's right.

4718
03:42:09,770 --> 03:42:10,470
That's what he meant.

4719
03:42:11,450 --> 03:42:21,890

So yeah, yeah, yeah.

4729
03:43:16,980 --> 03:43:17,620
Oh, it's not bad at all.

4730

Seven points.

4731
03:43:18,240 --> 03:43:18,840
We had 10 point game.

4732
03:43:18,920 --> 03:43:19,880
We're definitely back in it.

4733
03:43:19,980 --> 03:43:20,080
Yeah.

4734
03:43:20,300 --> 03:43:21,660
I got rid of TSM.

4735
03:43:22,040 --> 03:43:22,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4736
03:43:23,320 --> 03:43:24,000
Yeah, yeah.

4737
03:43:24,000 --> 03:43:24,300
All right.

4738
03:43:26,040 --> 03:43:26,500
Let's go.

4739
03:43:26,500 --> 03:43:27,520
Guys, okay.

4740
03:43:27,920 --> 03:43:28,460
Wait, wait, wait.

4741
03:43:28,620 --> 03:43:29,160
12, 9, 7.

4742
03:43:29,220 --> 03:43:30,680
We need, we need third and three kills.

4743
03:43:31,620 --> 03:43:31,980
Easy.

4744
03:43:32,300 --> 03:43:32,540
Nice.

4745
03:43:32,740 --> 03:43:32,900
Yeah.

4746
03:43:33,320 --> 03:43:34,280
It's so easy, guys.

4747
03:43:34,380 --> 03:43:35,540
We have two POIs.

4748
03:43:35,700 --> 03:43:36,500
We can't fuck this up.

4749
03:43:37,860 --> 03:43:38,580
Yeah, exactly.

4750
03:43:39,360 --> 03:43:40,200
There's no way.

4751
03:43:41,560 --> 03:43:42,220
There's no way.

4752
03:43:43,400 --> 03:43:43,480
Yeah.

4753
03:43:43,500 --> 03:43:45,600
Oh, I'll just type code in chat.

4754
03:43:45,860 --> 03:43:47,120
Oh, I like that actually.

4755
03:43:47,320 --> 03:43:49,340
That would be so funny, but we will not.

4756
03:43:49,620 --> 03:43:51,020
Your loadout was crazy, bro.

4757
03:43:51,520 --> 03:43:53,220
P20 charge rifle is nuts.

4758
03:43:53,340 --> 03:43:54,360
Yeah, that's what I was saying.

4759
03:43:54,960 --> 03:43:56,160
I was like, is that P20?

4760
03:43:56,760 --> 03:43:58,480
I don't think that makes it better.

4761
03:43:58,920 --> 03:44:00,180
I don't think that makes it better.

4762
03:44:01,400 --> 03:44:05,020
There were so many big guns on the ground when I passed, it
was crazy.

4763
03:44:05,640 --> 03:44:07,000
Wait, hammer doesn't make it better.

4764
03:44:07,000 --> 03:44:07,780
No way that makes it better.

4765
03:44:08,840 --> 03:44:10,900
I was also looking for a read.

4766
03:44:11,780 --> 03:44:12,240
That's why.

03:44:14,160 --> 03:44:26,860

left me alone i feel like i could have flew and then landed

4772
03:45:06,800 --> 03:45:11,480
somewhere and just wrapped jammed all the way to the third
challenge your circuit no one no team actually thinks for

4773
03:45:11,480 --> 03:45:16,880
themselves They rely on feelings, not...

4774
03:45:16,880 --> 03:45:17,680
Yo, you know what?

4775
03:45:17,720 --> 03:45:18,440
They should make it.

4776
03:45:18,640 --> 03:45:20,800
And then we can play Pathfinder.

4777
03:45:20,960 --> 03:45:24,400
They should make it so Pathfinder can't be scanned because
he's a robot.

4778
03:45:24,640 --> 03:45:25,480
What the fuck?

4779
03:45:25,760 --> 03:45:26,040
True.

4780
03:45:26,560 --> 03:45:30,120
Yeah, because then we could just play Pathfinder and no one
would scan us.

4781
03:45:31,060 --> 03:45:33,440
Yeah, but then the rest of us can get scanned.

4782
03:45:33,900 --> 03:45:34,200
Oh, no.

4783
03:45:34,340 --> 03:45:35,040
When we're ratting.

4784
03:45:35,520 --> 03:45:38,080
Oh, when the rat has to rat.

4785
03:45:39,640 --> 03:45:42,580
Yeah, when the Pathfinder has to rat, basically.

4786
03:45:42,820 --> 03:45:43,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4787
03:45:43,660 --> 03:45:44,800
Oh, I see.

4788
03:45:45,020 --> 03:45:48,560
Great job fighting to that team who tried to fight us
leaving Geyser.

4789
03:45:49,480 --> 03:45:49,860
I got you.

4790
03:45:49,860 --> 03:45:51,260
Yeah, that means I think that's us.

4791
03:45:51,980 --> 03:45:52,660
Whoever Geyser.

4792
03:45:54,280 --> 03:45:55,000
Wait, what were you saying?

4793
03:45:55,120 --> 03:45:57,040
They were beating each other off in the Geyser room?

4794
03:45:57,320 --> 03:45:58,100
The Geyser choke?

4795
03:45:58,960 --> 03:45:59,120
Yeah.

4796
03:46:00,340 --> 03:46:01,400
Were we at the Geyser choke?

4797
03:46:01,640 --> 03:46:02,680
We were not at the Geyser choke.

4798
03:46:02,880 --> 03:46:05,860
Oh, no, but the team Geyser choke didn't shoot the Bluebeans
team at all.

4799
03:46:05,960 --> 03:46:06,940
I don't know what the fuck they were doing.

4800
03:46:08,100 --> 03:46:11,500
Like, in that situation, like, we were, like, definitely
made me need to show more presence in the front.

4801
03:46:11,600 --> 03:46:13,480
But that team on Geyser choke should be shooting that
Bluebeans.

4802
03:46:13,500 --> 03:46:26,180
the whole time as like the freest kills for both of us i
believe in us guys we can do this there's no way we just

4803
03:46:26,180 --> 03:46:36,620
need a really really really good last game no just a just a
semi three three and three isn't that that much of a stretch

4804
03:46:36,620 --> 03:46:43,840
this is literally our last game tempo we really need a good
game yeah yeah three and three 12 9 7 that's 10 that's 10

4805
03:46:43,840 --> 03:46:58,780
points you know teammate is duo do we just land on them no
yeah we get two free kills no what if another team thirds as

4806
03:46:58,780 --> 03:47:07,200
well we there's no way there's no way i bet you this team we
play we play three shooting people or three ability damage

4807
03:47:07,200 --> 03:47:10,380
There's no way we're not griefing our last game.

4808
03:47:11,360 --> 03:47:14,200
Maggie fuse and oh shoot stuff and Valk.

4809
03:47:14,520 --> 03:47:16,300
Maggie fuse and Valk and then we land on the duo.

4810
03:47:16,560 --> 03:47:18,080
He wants us to land on the duo.

4811
03:47:18,500 --> 03:47:25,460
Maggie, Maggie, Fuse and Valk and we just ability spam team
eight and land on them, late land on them and then get two

4812
03:47:25,460 --> 03:47:25,980
free points.

4813
03:47:26,800 --> 03:47:28,160
Where do we, where?

4814
03:47:30,140 --> 03:47:31,800

4820
03:47:50,900 --> 03:47:51,960
I don't think you.

4821
03:47:51,980 --> 03:47:53,300

What do we want?

4877
03:51:07,610 --> 03:51:08,470
Top thermal or?

4878
03:51:10,570 --> 03:51:12,970
Yeah, it's going to be thermal choke zone for sure.

4879
03:51:13,970 --> 03:51:16,050
Or yeah, there's an energy mag here.

4880
03:51:20,970 --> 03:51:22,250
I'm going to grab this.

4881
03:51:22,390 --> 03:51:24,230
Actually, no, I don't need a repeater anymore.

4882
03:51:24,430 --> 03:51:25,090
I have a carbide.

4883
03:51:25,590 --> 03:51:27,170
There's a purple heavy mag here.

4884
03:51:28,030 --> 03:51:29,210
Someone win thermal will be really good.

4885
03:51:29,270 --> 03:51:30,850
I think the two-story buildings will be really good for us.

4886
03:51:30,950 --> 03:51:32,110
So we should probably rush immediately if we can.

4887
03:51:32,290 --> 03:51:33,430

Good job, though.

4980
03:56:29,530 --> 03:56:31,830
Like, honestly, we just got grief last game.

4981
03:56:31,930 --> 03:56:33,330
We're actually calling zones, like, pretty good.

4982
03:56:33,430 --> 03:56:34,030
We're not doing anything wrong.

4983
03:56:34,230 --> 03:56:34,330
Yeah, yeah.

4984
03:56:34,410 --> 03:56:36,770
It's just other people ruining our game.

4985
03:56:37,870 --> 03:56:39,510
It seems like that's a very common trend for us.

4986
03:56:41,530 --> 03:56:42,950
We never do anything wrong.

4987
03:56:43,090 --> 03:56:44,290
No, we just need this to pull.

4988
03:56:44,330 --> 03:56:47,270

I can.

5086
04:01:52,030 --> 04:01:55,790
Look for these kills on the outside.

5087
04:01:56,170 --> 04:01:56,870
You want me to help shoot?

5088
04:01:57,750 --> 04:01:57,990
Yeah, sure.

5089
04:01:58,270 --> 04:01:58,490

Nice.

04:02:03,670 --> 04:02:07,750
I think they're full dead.

5098
04:02:07,970 --> 04:02:08,110
They're all dead.

5099
04:02:08,230 --> 04:02:08,430
They're all dead.

5100
04:02:08,430 --> 04:02:08,870
Everyone died over there.

I'm not even kidding.

5114
04:03:13,290 --> 04:03:14,630
How the fuck would he have got to the roof?

5115
04:03:14,750 --> 04:03:15,770
There's no way he would have lived.

5116
04:03:16,410 --> 04:03:17,350
I was like, tempo!

5117
04:03:18,390 --> 04:03:19,210

5118
04:03:19,530 --> 04:03:19,730
Okay.

5119
04:03:20,310 --> 04:03:21,890
That's the team on the roof though.

5120
04:03:24,790 --> 04:03:25,350
It's okay.

5121
04:03:25,950 --> 04:03:27,590
They will never remember me.

5122
04:03:28,250 --> 04:03:28,270
No.

5123
04:03:28,470 --> 04:03:30,270
Wait, is there a bolt up here that I can take for...

5124
04:03:30,270 --> 04:03:30,790
Dude, his mind is gonna fight.

5125
04:03:31,550 --> 04:03:32,450
His mind should fight.

5126
04:03:34,010 --> 04:03:34,790
We'll see what happens.

5127
04:03:34,850 --> 04:03:35,930
They're coming on the outside of us right now.

5128
04:03:36,070 --> 04:03:36,270
We're good.

5129
04:03:36,510 --> 04:03:36,730
Okay.

5130
04:03:37,010 --> 04:03:37,830
The fight underneath is the left.

5131
04:03:39,530 --> 04:03:40,710
Yeah, they're over there.

5132
04:03:41,050 --> 04:03:42,870
Then one team's behind and one team's up there.

5133
04:03:43,350 --> 04:03:44,510
It's safe, but like not really.

5134
04:03:44,650 --> 04:03:45,790
When the zone closes in, they should get...

5135
04:03:45,790 --> 04:03:47,250
Is there anyone still in that other house or no?

5136
04:03:47,270 --> 04:03:47,690
Yeah, there is.

5137
04:03:47,790 --> 04:03:48,730
They literally stand.

5138
04:03:48,990 --> 04:03:49,150
Yeah.

5139
04:03:49,390 --> 04:03:50,250
We need these two teams to fight.

5140
04:03:50,330 --> 04:03:50,690
That's what we need.

5141
04:03:51,330 --> 04:03:52,590
They're using us as a buffer.

5142
04:03:53,290 --> 04:03:53,710
Yeah, it's fine.

5143
04:03:53,830 --> 04:03:53,930
That's good.

5144
04:03:54,010 --> 04:03:54,530
We're the buffer.

5145
04:03:55,630 --> 04:03:56,430
It's fine with me.

5146
04:03:56,470 --> 04:03:56,790
Okay.

5147
04:03:56,990 --> 04:03:57,870
You want to push us to hide?

5148
04:03:57,950 --> 04:03:58,390
You want to be scared?

5149
04:03:58,690 --> 04:03:59,150
You can hide.

5150
04:03:59,690 --> 04:04:00,270
Tempo come first.

5151
04:04:00,390 --> 04:04:00,830
Come second fourth.

5152
04:04:01,010 --> 04:04:01,070
Temple.

5153
04:04:01,110 --> 04:04:02,230
They need a door.

5154
04:04:02,430 --> 04:04:07,450
They need to stand west or east.

5155
04:04:08,250 --> 04:04:09,210
I want to be honest.

5156
04:04:09,210 --> 04:04:10,550
So scan my side every time.

5157
04:04:11,490 --> 04:04:12,370
Scan this way.

5158
04:04:12,570 --> 04:04:12,710
Nice.

5159
04:04:13,190 --> 04:04:13,970
Oh, that team is gone.

5160
04:04:14,970 --> 04:04:15,330
That's fine.

5161
04:04:15,750 --> 04:04:15,890
Oh, wait.

5162
04:04:16,050 --> 04:04:16,470
Never mind.

5163
04:04:17,130 --> 04:04:17,250
Yeah.

5164
04:04:18,410 --> 04:04:18,790
They're going to play.

5165
04:04:18,890 --> 04:04:19,370
Face her hopefully.

5166
04:04:19,530 --> 04:04:20,010
They're on our first floor.

5167
04:04:20,190 --> 04:04:20,430
Come on.

5168
04:04:20,490 --> 04:04:20,790
Come on.

5169
04:04:21,310 --> 04:04:24,910
We're going to fight soon.

5170
04:04:25,210 --> 04:04:26,270
They're going to fight soon.

5171
04:04:26,650 --> 04:04:27,330
I'm scanning five.

5172
04:04:28,450 --> 04:04:28,550
Yeah.

5173
04:04:28,650 --> 04:04:29,330
We're zones on us still.

5174
04:04:29,490 --> 04:04:29,550
We're good.

5175
04:04:29,670 --> 04:04:31,250
We just hold our second floor with everything we have.

5176
04:04:31,750 --> 04:04:33,150
I should have met like 50 gifted.

5177
04:04:33,370 --> 04:04:33,730
What the fuck?

5178
04:04:33,950 --> 04:04:34,270
Don't care.

5179
04:04:34,370 --> 04:04:34,610
Don't care.

5180
04:04:34,830 --> 04:04:35,110
Don't care.

5181
04:04:36,410 --> 04:04:36,770
Don't care.

5182
04:04:37,070 --> 04:04:37,170
Don't care.

5183
04:04:39,330 --> 04:04:40,890
Tempo, come over here, get another barrel in the balcony.

5184
04:04:41,050 --> 04:04:41,670
Get another barrel in the balcony.

5185
04:04:42,070 --> 04:04:42,850
You have the shootouts, okay.

5186
04:04:43,370 --> 04:04:44,130
It's worth it.

5187
04:04:44,470 --> 04:04:45,430
They can't really shoot out that easily.

5188
04:04:46,490 --> 04:04:46,750
Okay.

5189
04:04:47,550 --> 04:04:48,790
I'm watching the window down here.

5190
04:04:49,210 --> 04:04:49,470
Okay.

5191
04:04:50,510 --> 04:04:51,450
We're staying up here.

5192
04:04:51,930 --> 04:04:53,390
Are they on the roof right now or now?

5193
04:04:53,910 --> 04:04:54,170
No.

5194
04:04:54,610 --> 04:04:55,130
Okay, good.

5195
04:04:55,210 --> 04:04:55,810
That's great for us.

5196
04:04:55,930 --> 04:04:56,130
Let's go ahead.

5197
04:04:56,310 --> 04:04:57,990
I don't need it.

5198
04:04:58,070 --> 04:04:58,690
I'm good.

5199
04:04:58,870 --> 04:04:59,070
I'm good.

5200
04:04:59,070 --> 04:04:59,230
I'm good.

5201
04:04:59,410 --> 04:04:59,470
I'm good.

5202
04:05:00,990 --> 04:05:01,790
Oh, yeah.

5203
04:05:03,670 --> 04:05:04,890
We just stay inside.

5204
04:05:05,070 --> 04:05:06,130
We literally just don't want to stay inside.

5205
04:05:07,050 --> 04:05:08,610
Tempo, can you move this barrel?

5206
04:05:08,830 --> 04:05:09,090
This one?

5207
04:05:09,210 --> 04:05:11,690
and put it right actually the door right here.

5208
04:05:11,690 --> 04:05:12,270
Around the corner.

5209
04:05:12,490 --> 04:05:12,570
Nice.

5210
04:05:12,790 --> 04:05:13,090
Right here.

5211
04:05:13,290 --> 04:05:14,050
A lot of blood.

5212
04:05:14,330 --> 04:05:14,910
Yeah, let them do it.

5213
04:05:14,950 --> 04:05:15,310
Let them do it.

5214
04:05:15,390 --> 04:05:15,830
We're good guys.

5215
04:05:15,990 --> 04:05:16,390
Let them do it.

5216
04:05:17,690 --> 04:05:17,870
Oh!

5217
04:05:18,270 --> 04:05:18,770
Yeah, we're getting knocked.

5218
04:05:18,870 --> 04:05:19,170
You're getting knocked.

5219
04:05:19,350 --> 04:05:19,850
Don't go out.

5220
04:05:19,910 --> 04:05:20,430
Don't knock go out.

5221
04:05:20,510 --> 04:05:20,870
Let them die.

5222
04:05:21,050 --> 04:05:23,630
Yeah, there's literally no reason to kill.

5223
04:05:23,730 --> 04:05:24,330
We have two Kp.

5224
04:05:24,930 --> 04:05:25,630
Let them fight everything.

5225
04:05:25,990 --> 04:05:26,230
We're good.

5226
04:05:27,010 --> 04:05:27,630
We're doing it.

5227
04:05:27,630 --> 04:05:29,230
We're doing it right now.

5228
04:05:29,310 --> 04:05:29,730
We're doing great.

5229
04:05:30,050 --> 04:05:30,910
Really phenomenal guys.

5230
04:05:34,190 --> 04:05:34,990
They put a barrel on the boat.

5231
04:05:35,110 --> 04:05:36,770
I'm still staring first floor just before.

5232
04:05:37,250 --> 04:05:38,190
They put a barrel on the roof.

5233
04:05:38,490 --> 04:05:38,870
I got it.

5234
04:05:39,210 --> 04:05:40,010
I broke it.

5235
04:05:40,210 --> 04:05:41,350
I'm about syringes here, I think.

5236
04:05:41,750 --> 04:05:42,170
It's fine.

5237
04:05:42,370 --> 04:05:43,190
Do you need syringes?

5238
04:05:43,270 --> 04:05:43,950
Because I have some.

5239
04:05:44,130 --> 04:05:44,690
No, I'm good.

5240
04:05:44,810 --> 04:05:45,090
I'm playing.

5241
04:05:46,330 --> 04:05:48,210
I have two alt excels for you.

5242
04:05:49,430 --> 04:05:49,750
Okay.

5243
04:05:50,470 --> 04:05:51,450
Yeah, we're going to need your alt.

5244
04:05:51,610 --> 04:05:51,970
I do not.

5245
04:05:52,290 --> 04:05:53,070
I am full.

5246
04:05:53,470 --> 04:05:53,810
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5247
04:05:53,830 --> 04:05:54,110
No, no.

5248
04:05:54,190 --> 04:05:54,490
Don't worry.

5249
04:05:54,490 --> 04:05:55,990
I've not used my alt once.

5250
04:05:56,430 --> 04:05:56,570
Yeah.

5251
04:05:57,530 --> 04:05:58,450
There's just a random.

5252
04:05:58,550 --> 04:06:00,250
Oh, there's two guys right outside this door.

5253
04:06:00,650 --> 04:06:00,770
Yeah.

You're fine.

We just hold this.

5257
04:06:02,570 --> 04:06:02,590
It's fine.

5258
04:06:03,290 --> 04:06:05,610
It must be so confused with me staying up here.

5259
04:06:08,010 --> 04:06:09,030

04:06:24,270 --> 04:06:28,730
one up there yeah there's probably someone on the right for
sure yeah definitely there's one up there i see them wait

5264
04:06:28,730 --> 04:06:35,170
top five what do we need three top three probably oh maybe a
little bit more to be honest okay it's okay i'm just gonna

5265
04:06:35,170 --> 04:06:40,170
look for more kp on the outside we're good yeah there's two
two guys on the outside I mean, the zone's gonna end right

5266
04:06:40,170 --> 04:06:40,470
in front of us.

5267
04:06:40,550 --> 04:06:41,230
We're good right now.

5268
04:06:41,830 --> 04:06:47,010
Yeah, the whole team on the roof and then and then there's a
team on that door.

5269
04:06:47,470 --> 04:06:47,610
Okay.

5270
04:06:48,270 --> 04:06:51,130
Do we try to grab roof and then buckle?

5271
04:06:51,350 --> 04:06:52,230
No, no, they're on roof.

5272
04:06:52,390 --> 04:06:52,610
They're on roof.

5273
04:06:52,910 --> 04:06:54,750
There's a full three man in this costume here.

5274
04:06:54,750 --> 04:06:55,450
How do we get out of here?

5275
04:06:55,910 --> 04:06:57,450
We're gonna jump down and go left.

5276
04:06:57,630 --> 04:06:57,810
That's it.

5277
04:06:57,990 --> 04:06:58,210
Okay.

5278
04:06:58,930 --> 04:07:00,550
Once I just stand up there, I'm gonna break barrels out of
here.

5279
04:07:00,650 --> 04:07:00,810
One sec.

5280
04:07:02,090 --> 04:07:02,410
Step there.

5281
04:07:03,050 --> 04:07:04,670
Oh, this is nerve wracking.

5282
04:07:05,330 --> 04:07:06,910
We're going to jump down and go left on the staircase.

5283
04:07:07,250 --> 04:07:07,350
Right here.

5284
04:07:07,350 --> 04:07:07,910
There's that one rat.

5285
04:07:08,010 --> 04:07:08,910
There's a rat right here.

5286
04:07:10,830 --> 04:07:14,570
We can just rush that rat and then we could get in three
kills.

5287
04:07:15,130 --> 04:07:17,610
You're gonna have to jump out and play this fucking fence
line over here on the left side, okay?

5288
04:07:18,910 --> 04:07:20,210
We're gonna have a smoke where they just ulti are.

5289
04:07:20,270 --> 04:07:21,370
I don't know, he sees me.

5290
04:07:22,470 --> 04:07:22,790
It's okay.

5291
04:07:23,650 --> 04:07:25,070
We need this team to die on the right, bro.

5292
04:07:25,130 --> 04:07:26,850
This team down below on us is really fucking us, to be
honest.

5293
04:07:26,950 --> 04:07:27,250
Right here?

5294
04:07:27,710 --> 04:07:29,710
Yeah, this team is fucking us, but it's gonna be really hard
to do anything.

5295
04:07:29,810 --> 04:07:30,150
They're right here.

5296
04:07:31,390 --> 04:07:32,470
They're putting barrels on us.

5297
04:07:33,130 --> 04:07:34,150
They're trying to trap us inside.

5298
04:07:34,370 --> 04:07:35,690
They're gonna probably call StiglDS here late game.

5299
04:07:36,130 --> 04:07:36,830
They'll be smart if they did.

5300
04:07:37,510 --> 04:07:38,070
What balcony?

5301
04:07:38,490 --> 04:07:40,130
Yeah, no, yeah, tell me you need to start bringing these
barrels outside.

5302
04:07:40,270 --> 04:07:41,050
They're putting barrels on your balcony.

5303
04:07:41,170 --> 04:07:41,590
You need to do it.

5304
04:07:41,650 --> 04:07:42,590
I can't.

5305
04:07:43,350 --> 04:07:43,990
It's on the outside.

5306
04:07:44,150 --> 04:07:44,230
I'm left.

5307
04:07:44,450 --> 04:07:44,690
Far left.

5308
04:07:45,070 --> 04:07:46,070
Just walk out, peek on the outside.

5309
04:07:47,270 --> 04:07:47,850
Right the barrels.

5310
04:07:48,030 --> 04:07:48,150
Nice.

5311
04:07:48,290 --> 04:07:48,730
That's your job.

5312
04:07:49,370 --> 04:07:50,750
We just jump out of your left side late.

5313
04:07:50,910 --> 04:07:51,690
So let's see what these guys do.

5314
04:07:51,790 --> 04:07:52,810
They have to leave before us.

5315
04:07:53,490 --> 04:07:54,250
Let's see what these guys do.

5316
04:07:54,930 --> 04:07:55,670
I'm playing my life.

5317
04:07:55,790 --> 04:07:56,230
No matter what.

5318
04:07:56,330 --> 04:07:56,430
Okay.

5319
04:07:56,670 --> 04:07:56,910
Me too.

5320
04:07:58,770 --> 04:07:59,650
We stay alive here.

5321
04:08:00,250 --> 04:08:00,810
Good ulti.

5322
04:08:01,150 --> 04:08:01,430
Or grenade.

5323
04:08:03,050 --> 04:08:04,930
Can you scan underneath us and see what they are on the left
side?

5324
04:08:05,030 --> 04:08:05,470
I don't know.

5325
04:08:06,030 --> 04:08:06,510
It's still there.

5326
04:08:06,630 --> 04:08:06,730
Okay.

5327
04:08:07,990 --> 04:08:09,270
So yeah, stay inside late.

5328
04:08:09,490 --> 04:08:09,770
Stay inside late.

5329
04:08:09,850 --> 04:08:10,570
We're going to swing out left.

5330
04:08:11,550 --> 04:08:12,970
We're going to cost you all these kids too late.

5331
04:08:13,010 --> 04:08:13,270
Right side.

5332
04:08:14,030 --> 04:08:14,370
Okay.

5333
04:08:14,370 --> 04:08:14,730
Play here slow.

5334
04:08:15,230 --> 04:08:17,290
Need them on the right side.

5335
04:08:17,330 --> 04:08:18,010
Oh, just kill them on the right.

5336
04:08:18,690 --> 04:08:19,030
Okay.

5337
04:08:19,310 --> 04:08:19,530
Okay.

5338
04:08:19,530 --> 04:08:19,650
All right.

5339
04:08:19,850 --> 04:08:20,250
Kill these kids.

5340
04:08:20,250 --> 04:08:20,290
Kill them.

5341
04:08:20,410 --> 04:08:21,110
Kill them.

5342
04:08:21,430 --> 04:08:21,850
Kill them.

5343
04:08:23,590 --> 04:08:24,270
Kill them.

5344
04:08:24,270 --> 04:08:25,110
Kill them.

5345
04:08:25,110 --> 04:08:32,110
Top three with four kills.

5346
04:08:32,290 --> 04:08:32,510
I don't know.

5347
04:08:32,550 --> 04:08:32,830
I don't know.

5348
04:08:33,390 --> 04:08:35,330
11 points.

5349
04:08:35,490 --> 04:08:35,710
I don't know.

5350
04:08:35,830 --> 04:08:36,330
We needed to do that.

5351
04:08:37,350 --> 04:08:38,630
That was our only play.

5352
04:08:39,190 --> 04:08:40,510
I have no idea if it's enough or not.

5353
04:08:40,750 --> 04:08:43,070
11 points is a lot of points.

5354
04:08:44,130 --> 04:08:45,870
Oh my god, I have no idea.

5355
04:08:46,110 --> 04:08:47,270
I have no idea.

5356
04:08:47,550 --> 04:08:48,470
It's gonna be so close.

5357
04:08:50,230 --> 04:08:50,770
That was our only play.

5358
04:08:51,250 --> 04:08:51,970
That was...

5359
04:08:51,970 --> 04:08:52,670
Okay.

5360
04:08:53,970 --> 04:08:55,430
Oh my god.

5361
04:08:55,490 --> 04:08:56,850
That was so stressful.

5362
04:08:56,910 --> 04:08:57,990
That was a miracle play.

5363
04:08:59,930 --> 04:09:00,450
No!

5364
04:09:01,670 --> 04:09:02,190
No!

5365
04:09:02,750 --> 04:09:03,690
One point.

5366
04:09:09,870 --> 04:09:17,770
fucking kidding me wait oh my god wait is it are we actually
one

5367
04:09:24,010 --> 04:09:40,950
we got one more point we would have tied 10th place but we
win the tiebreaker oh Oh my God.

5368
04:09:40,950 --> 04:09:43,630
That's so hard, Frankie.

5369
04:09:43,890 --> 04:09:44,550
VG's, man.

5370
04:09:44,670 --> 04:09:45,210
It's all good.

5371
04:09:45,370 --> 04:09:46,690
Hey, listen, listen, we did a good job.

5372
04:09:46,890 --> 04:09:47,910
We did a good job.

5373
04:09:48,630 --> 04:09:49,230
Oh my God.

5374
04:09:49,230 --> 04:09:51,050
Dude, that was the one, man.

5375
04:09:51,330 --> 04:09:53,370
That was the fucking one, bro.

5376
04:09:53,790 --> 04:09:56,230
We even tempo your calculations.

5377
04:09:57,270 --> 04:09:57,870
No, tempo.

5378
04:09:57,990 --> 04:09:58,850
No, tempo was low key.

5379
04:09:59,170 --> 04:09:59,750
Almost right, though.

5380
04:09:59,830 --> 04:10:00,170
Yeah.

5381
04:10:00,170 --> 04:10:03,630
I mean, that was the, we really only just needed to get a
fucking snag of KP somewhere else.

5382
04:10:03,630 --> 04:10:04,410
Where are we going to look at?

5383
04:10:04,550 --> 04:10:04,810
You know what I mean?

5384
04:10:05,030 --> 04:10:06,350
Yeah, there was no way.

5385
04:10:06,490 --> 04:10:07,590
We're so broke.

5386
04:10:07,590 --> 04:10:18,330
and the the 10th place team will will randomly what did 10th
place get last game oh they got like oh oh no they got they

5387
04:10:18,330 --> 04:10:31,050
got three points last game if we get griefed last game we
quote oh my god we have grieved so high i can't believe they

5388
04:10:31,050 --> 04:10:38,230
got rid of the content team but wait wait better though we
did better we did better we always next year.

5389
04:10:38,630 --> 04:10:39,990
Yeah, I'll see you guys next year.

5390
04:10:40,110 --> 04:10:40,970
All right, we'll return.

5391
04:10:42,230 --> 04:10:43,130
What is the next one?

5392
04:10:43,230 --> 04:10:44,490
Is it after split one playoffs?

5393
04:10:45,650 --> 04:10:46,090
Actually.

5394
04:10:47,570 --> 04:10:48,450
When's the next one?

5395
04:10:48,590 --> 04:10:49,910
Yeah, yeah, it would be after.

5396
04:10:50,050 --> 04:10:53,030
It would be like whenever so land is May.

5397
04:10:53,630 --> 04:10:53,630
Okay.

5398
04:10:54,410 --> 04:11:01,150
And then split one would start somewhere around the end of
May or early June.

5399
04:11:01,310 --> 04:11:03,010
So I guess that would be when it is.

5400
04:11:03,250 --> 04:11:06,450
End of May or early June is when CC1 should be.

5401
04:11:06,990 --> 04:11:07,430
Okay.

5402
04:11:07,590 --> 04:11:16,710
because they have a pro league qualifiers next week oh my
god i can't believe it we were so close we're literally one

5403
04:11:16,710 --> 04:11:26,810
point no i'm so bad we win the tiebreaker off of that too oh
my god we did one more kp bro oh we did so good you guys did

5404
04:11:26,810 --> 04:11:34,510
so good dropping down we got the oh my god we got both kp
too yeah no we got it all we got both that those kills there

5405
04:11:34,510 --> 04:11:38,090
was no way we could get third Yeah.

5406
04:11:38,510 --> 04:11:40,470
There's no way we can even get third place there.

5407
04:11:40,570 --> 04:11:40,950
We're just dead.

5408
04:11:41,150 --> 04:11:41,970
Yeah, there's no way.

5409
04:11:41,990 --> 04:11:43,450
No, we did get third place.

5410
04:11:43,650 --> 04:11:44,090
That's the thing.

5411
04:11:44,210 --> 04:11:45,510
I mean, I mean, second, my bad, my bad.

5412
04:11:45,950 --> 04:11:47,230
Yeah, it was the only way.

5413
04:11:47,590 --> 04:11:50,270
There's no way we could have got like second place.

5414
04:11:50,490 --> 04:11:51,490
I can't believe it.

5415
04:11:51,610 --> 04:11:56,770
If we didn't get grief last game, remember those names,
remember those names last game that creep.

5416
04:11:58,630 --> 04:11:59,430
That's on you.

5417
04:11:59,630 --> 04:12:00,010
Remember those.

5418
04:12:00,550 --> 04:12:04,130
I will write those names in my death, death note book.

5419
04:12:04,850 --> 04:12:06,470
Well, end game, end game.

5420
04:12:06,790 --> 04:12:06,970
End game.

5421
04:12:07,230 --> 04:12:07,270
End game.

5422
04:12:07,590 --> 04:12:17,270
that we're not writing any names in anything like that
because we missed like maybe one or two kp on that team

5423
04:12:17,270 --> 04:12:22,210
fighting in that show we got two of them but there's like
one more we could have got yeah the stars were aligning to

5424
04:12:22,210 --> 04:12:32,170
oh my god what a heartbreaker oh shit we're improving we're
improving i'll see you guys next challenge i get a lot i had

5425
04:12:32,170 --> 04:12:37,410
a lot of fun this week though that was good that was fun one
month break and then we run it back yeah oh i'm so down you

5426
04:12:37,410 --> 04:12:41,410
know the lives if we make it past day one you're all proud
of us i'll be that was that was actually way big improvement

5427
04:12:41,410 --> 04:12:48,470
though yeah we improved so much i feel like we should have
been able to get that type of game every game okay so here's

5428
04:12:48,470 --> 04:12:54,770
the thing though we're gonna ruin valcon 99 of the time okay
if we're on storm point two then yes if we avoid all the

5429
04:12:54,770 --> 04:13:00,310
bullshit bro we just we just get top threes like we just
literally because i could call zones teams won't feed you

5430
04:13:00,310 --> 04:13:05,370
inside feed face inside of a house because it's hard to push
the cost like we just need to avoid the the really sketchy

5431
04:13:05,370 --> 04:13:10,210
spots i guess at all costs like you can think there's a
slight chance a dumb team will push you guess what that team

5432
04:13:10,210 --> 04:13:16,710
is done and they are exactly yeah so like now we know though
like we just need to play inside spots where they there's

5433
04:13:16,710 --> 04:13:22,290
just no way they push us yeah we need to play costing and
just get inside we can't be pinched anyway or nothing yeah

5434
04:13:22,290 --> 04:13:29,670
there's like no they'll fucking run out of yeah pretty
pretty fucking evident i guess all right we got we're

round three we're gonna make it What did they get this game?

5436
04:13:36,250 --> 04:13:37,590
It must have got a lot of points.

5437
04:13:37,890 --> 04:13:40,610
They died in, they died in 10th with zero.

5438
04:13:40,970 --> 04:13:41,470
Oh my God.

5439
04:13:42,030 --> 04:13:45,270
If they died in 11th, one more place earlier.

5440
04:13:46,330 --> 04:13:47,430
That actually is unbelievable.

5441
04:13:49,090 --> 04:13:49,730
All right.

5442
04:13:49,730 --> 04:13:50,890
Well, we improved.

5443
04:13:51,190 --> 04:13:52,610
I'm happy we improved though.

5444
04:13:52,730 --> 04:13:53,290

We got so much better.

5447
04:13:56,410 --> 04:13:59,090
And we didn't have like some team that's purposely griefing
us.

5448
04:13:59,210 --> 04:13:59,530
We landed.

5449
04:13:59,690 --> 04:14:00,250
That was good.

5450
04:14:00,670 --> 04:14:01,010
We landed.

5451
04:14:01,130 --> 04:14:02,510
Lightning Rod and Siphon too.

5452
04:14:02,790 --> 04:14:03,130

5454
04:14:11,690 --> 04:14:16,610
way more locked in this week like breaking barrel or putting
barrels down we just looked like way better yeah getting

actually, yeah.

5458
04:14:32,450 --> 04:14:34,450
We need a, we all need, we need a liquidakedia too.

5459
04:14:34,770 --> 04:14:35,410
Yeah, we're official.

5460
04:14:35,710 --> 04:14:36,190
We're official.

5461
04:14:36,370 --> 04:14:38,050
We're an official team signed by TSM.

5462
04:14:38,650 --> 04:14:40,170
Yeah, low key sexist, she doesn't have one yet.

5463
04:14:40,270 --> 04:14:40,850
I don't want to say it.

5464
04:14:41,230 --> 04:14:41,550
Wait a minute.

5465
04:14:42,030 --> 04:14:43,150
We took out, wait, wait a minute.

5466
04:14:43,310 --> 04:14:43,930
We took off the 10.

5467
04:14:44,410 --> 04:14:45,110
Yeah, no, no, no.

5468
04:14:45,190 --> 04:14:47,390
And then we got let go by TSM cause we failed.

5469
04:14:47,870 --> 04:14:48,570
We've got it.

5470
04:14:49,430 --> 04:14:51,170
We only get signed while we're playing.

5471
04:14:51,350 --> 04:14:52,390
And then we got let go in between.

5472
04:14:52,690 --> 04:14:54,370
Yeah, we got let go cause we didn't make it.

5473
04:14:54,770 --> 04:14:56,450
So we're free agents now.

5474
04:14:56,670 --> 04:14:57,410
We're free agents.

5475
04:14:57,610 --> 04:14:58,810
Look, it's so good.

5476
04:14:59,330 --> 04:14:59,930
It's okay.

5477
04:15:00,050 --> 04:15:00,890
Next challenge is circuit.

5478
04:15:00,910 --> 04:15:06,590
we're going to run it back yes 100 i wonder what the meta
will be then who knows what's saying yeah yeah okay we'll

5479
04:15:06,590 --> 04:15:16,310
stick with this i don't know we are not i don't know we
might need this constant blood all the time okay it's okay

5480
04:15:16,310 --> 04:15:22,550
that's why we're like we're not going to do the nh trap
where after one bad tournament we break up no no no no we're

5481
04:15:22,550 --> 04:15:31,070
yeah i mean that means we're staying together for every
rivals too right yeah okay um yeah yeah i mean it's If I

5482
04:15:31,070 --> 04:15:33,590
need to win money one month to pay a mortgage, I'm sorry
about that.

5483
04:15:34,110 --> 04:15:39,330
Hey, hey, hey, hey, every, I mean, it's, yeah, all right,
this Twitch rivals might be random.

5484
04:15:39,470 --> 04:15:40,110
We don't know that.

5485
04:15:40,570 --> 04:15:42,330
This Twitch rivals was an anomaly.

5486
04:15:42,550 --> 04:15:46,210
Every other Twitch rivals we played, we've been like middle
of the pack.

5487
04:15:46,970 --> 04:15:48,230
We've done one.

5488
04:15:49,610 --> 04:15:50,730
What do you mean?

5489
04:15:50,950 --> 04:15:53,930
Every other, this is our, that last one was our second.

5490
04:15:54,510 --> 04:15:55,910
What is this data pool?

5491
04:15:56,010 --> 04:15:57,630
We have two Twitch rivals together.

5492
04:15:57,850 --> 04:16:05,110
I remember playing like four Twitch rivals and i kept
getting in the middle i played one two twitch rivals with

5493
04:16:05,110 --> 04:16:10,370
you guys not four yeah i might have played two i might have
played two without you yeah probably done better than the

5494
04:16:10,370 --> 04:16:19,470
two with us oh yeah so so donkey was the one that was like
oh no what do you mean money's on the line we play someone

5495
04:16:19,470 --> 04:16:33,910
else but i plays better oh whoa whoa wow i've placed higher
definitely before i've I think Doki has more earnings than

5496
04:16:33,910 --> 04:16:34,150
TEPO.

5497
04:16:34,330 --> 04:16:34,870
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

5498
04:16:35,230 --> 04:16:35,650
I'm pretty sure.

5499
04:16:35,710 --> 04:16:37,090
My liquipedia is out there.

5500
04:16:37,390 --> 04:16:38,310
I definitely have more.

5501
04:16:38,410 --> 04:16:39,310
All right, that's it.

5502
04:16:40,370 --> 04:16:40,770
Liquipedia.

5503
04:16:41,310 --> 04:16:42,950
I don't have a liquipedia.

5504
04:16:43,210 --> 04:16:43,610
That's the thing.

5505
04:16:43,630 --> 04:16:44,330
Wait, don't what?

5506
04:16:44,590 --> 04:16:46,350
I don't have one because they removed it.

5507
04:16:46,350 --> 04:16:47,050
Not even under.

5508
04:16:47,410 --> 04:16:49,170
Oh, wait, they removed it.

5509
04:16:49,170 --> 04:16:50,090
They got removed.

5510
04:16:50,190 --> 04:16:52,030
They removed it because they were like, there's not.

5511
04:16:52,050 --> 04:16:53,730
So you had one, but then they removed it.

5512
04:16:53,750 --> 04:16:56,930
Yeah, because they were like, it's not, the tournaments
aren't official enough.

5513
04:16:57,350 --> 04:16:58,730
So they removed my liquipedia.

5514
04:16:59,290 --> 04:17:00,890
Yeah, but they still don't make it.

5515
04:17:00,910 --> 04:17:09,270
for me the moderators hate me because i'm an anime girl
money from an official tournament that means we have to that

5516
04:17:09,270 --> 04:17:17,030
means we have to get into pro league and then get i
literally win more money in unofficial tournaments for sure

5517
04:17:17,030 --> 04:17:24,970
you definitely do without a unofficial apex turn i can
unofficial apex tournaments pay more than a without a doubt

5518
04:17:24,970 --> 04:17:34,450
oh 100 100 that's your show right i deserve it ggs guys

than like nine other teams that's on them that's no we did
