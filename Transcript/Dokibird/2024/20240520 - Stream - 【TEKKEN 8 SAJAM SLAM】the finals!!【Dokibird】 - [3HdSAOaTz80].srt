1
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:56,100
I had to take 20 hits because at the swap scenes.

2
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:01,540
He gets a free win!

3
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,360
Round 3.

4
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:09,440
Please.

5
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:12,700
Please.

6
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,380
Please.

7
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,020
Leave me alone.

8
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,080
I'm playing quick play.

9
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,160
because I don't want to lose Shinri.

10
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:27,560
I didn't want to lose Shinri before this stream.

11
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,100
Round 4.

12
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:31,320
Fight!

13
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,960
To be alone!

14
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,100
Yay!

15
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:41,950
I'm blocked.

16
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:43,170
Goodbye.

17
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:49,250
I won a quick play game.

18
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:50,010
Let's go.

00:03:53,190 --> 00:04:10,650

21
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,470
I'm like two rings.

22
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:26,610
Oh, Shinri-yu.

23
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:30,210
Shinri-yu.

24
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:31,290
It's the same.

25
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:34,770
Okay, I'm going into the main menu now.

26
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:36,230
I didn't forget.

27
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:43,850
Hey, hey, hey.

28
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:44,970
Not feeling good today?

29
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:46,470
I feel so good.

30
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:47,510
I'm not going to throw up.

31
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:48,170
Ready to go.

32
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:49,430
Yeah, totally.

33
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:50,090
I didn't already.

34
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,230
I feel so good.

35
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:53,250
Did you throw up from the pressure already?

36
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:54,610
No, no, no.

37
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:54,930
Yeah.

38
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:57,290
How are you feeling pressured?

39
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,010
You literally got coached, Matt.

40
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:02,070
You actually got coached this time.

41
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:04,430
I'm always pressured.

42
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:07,390
It's Sunday.

43
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:09,430
You rise again on Sunday.

44
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:14,150
Okay, I'm ready.

45
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:15,730
I'm ready for you.

46
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:17,350
Where's slime?

47
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:24,130
The reason I was going to come here earlier and warm up, but
I was just watching the melee restream with slime all

48
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:24,550
morning.

49
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:25,330
What?

50
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:27,750
Yeah, I was watching Gommel 2.

51
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:29,050
I can't believe it.

52
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,910
You guys are not serious.

53
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:32,030
Dude, don't worry.

54
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:33,130
I was...

55
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:33,750
Okay, that's okay.

56
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:34,390
I was practicing.

57
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:39,770
Me, slime, or Kony just needs to lose one so we can force
Brawl Pro to play a game.

58
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:41,110
Why do you want to force that?

59
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:42,190
Why are we forcing it?

60
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:44,530
Because somebody didn't take it seriously.

61
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:45,450
Because you got to earn it.

62
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:46,950
You got to earn it.

63
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:52,270
You fucking watched a different stream instead of help
coaching us.

64
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:55,230
You're going to slide off me, Doki, and slime.

65
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:57,430
Yeah, you got mooch off of us?

66
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:00,390
I'm going to make sure Groomey hits every shot.

67
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:03,890
I'm just going to throw him.

68
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:06,750
He's just going to throw him on purpose.

69
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:10,550
Mine will be, oh, such a sad accident.

70
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:11,890
All the funny moves.

71
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:14,430
Key charge in front of them.

72
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:18,570
Dude, I was playing Jack in Quick Play yesterday.

73
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:20,590
That character is so fucking funny.

74
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:24,790
He just, he has so many stupid moves that you would never
do.

75
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:27,010
I love him.

76
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:28,410
Yeah, he's goofy.

77
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:29,810
Maybe that could be your number two.

78
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:32,270
I think I would like him more than Paul.

79
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:36,570
I played a little bit of Paul, and he's good, but I think
you have to be good at the game.

80
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:39,190
I think I could just do done on the shit with Jack.

81
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:39,930
You know?

82
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:41,050
And that'd be good.

83
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:43,850
I wish there were hero bands in Tekken.

84
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:45,090
Hero bands.

85
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:47,910
God, I've got that overarching ring rod.

86
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:49,190
I know that's you.

87
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:54,350
Could you imagine the level of play in this tournament if
there were, it would all just be like one twos.

88
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:55,410
People would just be hitting one twos.

89
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:56,210
over and over.

90
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:00,070
See?

91
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:00,690
Oh, wait.

92
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:02,450
What?

93
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:04,130
While standing.

94
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:05,150
There you go.

95
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:08,290
And then remember, Gumi's gonna mash after two.

96
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:11,350
So you gotta forward two one after.

97
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:12,450
Remember?

98
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:15,010
Okay.

99
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:17,410
I matched it.

100
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:20,110
Remember your forward two one after?

101
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:20,870
Yeah.

102
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:21,990
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

103
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:22,570
Two elbow.

104
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:23,130
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

105
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:24,470
Because she'll mash after your Punisher.

106
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:26,490
Oh shit.

107
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:27,790
What the fuck?

108
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:28,910
No slimes here but then.

109
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:29,630
Yes.

110
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:30,770
Just like that.

111
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:32,530
And from a distance.

112
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:37,670
It's okay.

113
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:38,130
It's okay.

114
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:38,990
That's why we're here.

115
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:42,790
No!

116
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:44,570
Okay.

117
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:45,390
No!

118
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:50,270
See, this is why I knew this before our game.

119
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:54,030
She's grunting like she's getting hit in real life.

120
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:56,210
Yeah.

121
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:58,990
Oh, come on!

122
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:00,530
How come I couldn't get that?

123
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:02,430
There you go.

124
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:04,070
There you go.

125
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:05,630
Fucking warm up right here.

126
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:07,310
Yeah, see, see, I'm warming up the fingers.

127
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:09,890
Okay, this is not fair.

128
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:16,490
All right, and then she also does that a lot.

129
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:17,410
Yeah!

130
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:20,030
That's right!

131
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:22,470
Okay, that's not right.

132
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:23,690
I think she'll do it again after meeting you.

133
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:26,370
That's not right.

134
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:27,090
That's not right.

135
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:28,910
No, they don't stream every match.

136
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:29,290
Not?

137
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:29,590
Okay.

138
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:31,870
Yeah, so it's gonna be one side of the bracket.

139
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:32,910
I don't know.

140
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:33,790
I'll have to chat, I guess.

141
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:34,190
Oh.

142
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:35,730
Oh.

143
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:38,010
While setting four after you duck it and the back three.

144
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:38,770
Okay.

145
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:39,510
Or, yeah.

146
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,890
Just while setting four and then back three.

147
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:42,710
Alright.

148
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:44,270
Do you know while setting four?

149
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:45,870
The one you're doing to punish this with.

150
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:46,570
Yeah.

151
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:49,950
Um, when you dug, just do it again.

152
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:51,270
Okay.

153
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:51,910
Or that.

154
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:54,870
I mean, you can do that if you want to.

155
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,930
if you're up for it.

156
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:00,370
That.

157
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:02,830
Okay.

158
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:06,670
What?

159
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:08,150
I mashed, though.

160
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:11,550
Sometimes it doesn't register when I mash.

161
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:13,270
Okay, do it far.

162
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:14,110
Yeah.

163
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:15,170
Hell yeah.

164
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:16,070
Hell yeah.

165
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:21,950
And remember that step, too.

166
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:23,270
That's a good way to make space.

167
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:24,030
Yeah.

168
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:31,930
see i can learn do it again do it again the jaguar step and
then it's back three plus four yeah and that then that's

169
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:37,210
what sets up for your running knee gumi will duck a lot when
you're running up on earth so you gotta do that knee into

170
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:47,550
the into the shoulder okay into your l3 or whatever that
yeah that one just hold forward and just mash that out yeah

175
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:27,640
There's no way!

176
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,000
It's only on block that you can mash it though.

177
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:36,820
Yes, yes, Agumi will mash after so you can forward to one
her right away.

178
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,160
Boom, boom, yeah, she's gonna get hit by that.

179
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:43,880
And then remember after that, then you can run up into all
your bullshit.

180
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:46,840
And yeah, your meat stuff, everything.

181
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:47,340
Okay.

Okay.

185
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:00,220
Oh my god.

186
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,460
What's up, Matt?

187
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,520
Are they starting?

188
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:05,860
Should be starting.

189
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:06,960
Oh, they didn't, yeah.

190
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:12,640
I'm just saying, because we gotta figure out, uh, where
we're gonna fight, and then check the engines.

191
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:13,360
She'll do it again.

192
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,460
Oh my god.

193
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,740
Oh my god, no!

194
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,700
I got confused.

195
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,400
Why are you streaming Tekken and not Tekken A?

196
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,160
She'll do it again.

197
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:25,140
in one?

198
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,800
Yeah, you're streaming Tekken.

199
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:27,480
No caps.

200
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,280
Just Tekken.

201
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:29,040
Okay.

202
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:31,900
I got it.

203
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,160
Okay.

204
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,040
Theme, we might be cooked.

205
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:36,700
What do you mean?

206
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,120
That's okay.

207
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:37,840
You know what?

208
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,660
I accept my fate.

209
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:39,620
I'm just kidding, dude.

210
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:41,020
I'm just joking.

211
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,940
I'm trying my best.

212
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:47,400
You gotta mix it up.

213
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,700
You gotta mix it up because now I'm thinking about the spin.

214
00:11:53,840 --> 00:12:07,120
You can't just keep doing the same thing see now i can't
block this now you you're doing fine you gotta mix it up see

215
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,980
now yeah oh my god

216
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:34,120
all right okay all right no no you got this oh no now i
don't feel that god anymore oh yeah and remember when we

217
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:39,960
talked about how to wake up off the floor too yeah like one
or two and instead of don't roll forward or you can just

218
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:47,540
hold back sometimes but generally just hit one or two to get
up and then when you get up hold back after okay yeah yeah

219
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:51,600
just like that that's a good way to get up wait why can't
luck okay

220
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:15,210
yeah good job i'm doing it don't i i i i panicked okay okay
don't if you duck this do the same thing the while standing

221
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:33,080
four the same okay after you duck let's see my fingers
reflexively go to three Yeah, but I'll go for it.

222
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,300
I'll try four again.

223
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,100
Okay.

224
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:38,820
Standing four.

225
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,880
So, can you do while standing four just in a neutral?

226
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:43,480
Like, if you crouch and like that?

227
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,240
Yeah?

228
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,120
That, yeah, that.

229
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:46,520
Yeah.

230
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,960
That's after we duck, that's what you basically let go
crouch and you hit.

231
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:50,300
Yeah.

232
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:50,680
Basically.

233
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:51,280
Okay.

234
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,780
And then after that, you can do back three.

235
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:56,420
If you hop kick after it, sometimes it's not going to work.

236
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:57,120
Okay.

237
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,720
And then you can back three there.

238
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,200
Okay.

239
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:10,620
your tornado oh no i honestly yeah yeah even if you don't
get the full punish as long as you're not getting hit by

240
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:21,440
that it's still yeah still pretty good yeah and she'll
always do it again remember every time so block after she

241
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,620
heat engages and then duck

242
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:38,320
you can even back three off of standing forward too even if
you get that kick yeah or yeah you can do that too

243
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:49,460
yeah and then you do the jaguar bomb the ender yeah there
you go oh fuck okay and you can take your time with the

244
00:14:49,460 --> 00:15:00,140
ender yeah you don't have to you know yes yes yeah oh god no

245
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,220
Here we go.

246
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:13,780
Alright.

247
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:22,420
And then remember, you have, in this range right here, you
have a good whiff punish that's a forward two one.

248
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:27,820
If you see them whiffing shit, yeah, it's a good move in
like a mid range at this level.

249
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,940
And then again, she's gonna start doing this from afar.

250
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:31,400
Okay, okay.

251
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:34,560
My mind didn't process it.

252
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:35,480
Okay, I'm ready.

253
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,040
It's three things.

254
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:37,400
Yeah.

255
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:38,240
Pop kick.

256
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,560
Pop kick before you think you have to.

257
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:41,980
Okay.

258
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,260
Okay.

259
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:48,720
It's not easy.

260
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,000
Fuck this, I'm doing this.

261
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,180
This is easier.

262
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,720
And then you can do the two kicks after and then back three.

263
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:57,740
Okay, try it.

264
00:15:58,660 --> 00:15:59,400
It's easier.

265
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,540
That's easier.

266
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:03,520
Yeah.

267
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:04,820
Yeah.

268
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,620
Oh, what?

269
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:17,910
Okay, whatever.

270
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:22,990
Oh, that didn't work.

271
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:24,710
What?

272
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,790
Yeah, that move sucks, and I'm not gonna lie.

273
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:30,810
So much!

274
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:33,790
You're doing good against it.

275
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:36,210
Yes.

276
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:37,430
Yes.

277
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:40,490
Oh, are you on your new PC now?

278
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:41,950
We didn't lag at all.

279
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:44,470
Um, I fixed it.

280
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:47,530
Wait, what?

281
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:48,930
IT, don't see.

282
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:50,070
I fixed it.

283
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:53,630
Oh, yeah.

284
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:57,290
And remember, you got the back three one plus two.

285
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:59,770
Pretend it's like a string and hit that.

286
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:01,450
Back three one plus two, remember?

287
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:03,570
Okay, back three one plus two.

288
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:03,990
Okay.

289
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:05,670
2-1.

290
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:08,290
Pretend it's a string and it should work or match it out.

291
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:09,710
Oh, no, that's not it.

292
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:17,150
You know that back three and it leads into the leg drop,
remember?

293
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:18,510
Yeah.

294
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:21,070
Try that.

295
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:23,810
Okay.

296
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:26,850
Okay.

297
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:27,970
No.

298
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:30,410
No.

299
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:31,790
No.

300
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,960
You can just hold one position.

301
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:44,540
two afterwards try that doki if you back three one plus two
and you just hold it after back three maybe it's easy yeah

just be like, please fight me.

309
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,880
Streams like Gumi, she's too low Elo to fight me.

00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:51,720
I'm sorry, this has to mean, like, like in the rank.

311
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,000
I can't fucking get into her rank matches.

312
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,660
Unless she does, like, I do plus, I do minus plus two.

313
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:01,140
And I'm Shinri-U right now.

314
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:11,800
So, like, I play against Vanquisher and which one is it i
like because i have a i strictly do like only within two of

315
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:18,900
my ranks and i don't think she's within two of my ranks at
the moment it's not toxic i can't literally catch stream

316
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:36,640
state the rank is goomy she's on destroyer okay she's on
destroyer oh she's playing now all right let's It's not

00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,840
I literally can't stream Snipe her in rank.

319
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,280
But I'm watching it right now.

320
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,340
I'm watching how...

321
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:45,320
Oh my gosh.

322
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,460
Amore's being the shit out of Agumi.

323
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,640
Like, what is she doing?

324
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:55,580
Because, like, I always... The only thing that she fucks me
up on is the spin.

325
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:56,660
That's literally it.

326
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:59,160
It's the fucking spin.

327
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,340
Doki, yeah, you gotta play one of these two.

328
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,360
Yeah, I'm surprised.

329
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,980
Like, what is Amore doing?

330
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:10,300
That's different from what I was doing.

331
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Oh, she knows combos.

332
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:12,960
That's what's different.

333
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,960
She actually knows combos.

334
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:19,920
Damn!

335
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,820

My god, why can't I do that?

337
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:30,460
She's not doing the spin?

338
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:31,200
Wait, what?

339
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:38,310
She is.

340
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:39,570
Wait, Amore's going crazy.

341
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:40,330
Oh.

342
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:48,910

combo she did kony doesn't even do that one what the fuck

343
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:52,670

344
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:00,750

That's all I need to know.

348
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:22,850
Okay, maybe not.

349
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:23,550
Maybe not.

350
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:24,290
I'm so sorry.

351
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:25,650
That's not all I need to know.

352
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:26,310
You're right.

353
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:28,830
You're right.

354
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:31,170
Oh, my God.

355
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:32,570

Okay, that's fine.

365
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:02,410
It's not fair.

366
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:04,150
How do all these players know combos?

367
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:17,010
Like, how do you stay in tenure knowing all these combos
when I can abuse certain stuff to shin you all i'm saying is

368
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:30,070
like i don't know if i don't know combos and i can get to
this rank in one week maybe these players are oh yeah

369
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:38,550
yesterday in rank i bumped into a in rank i had to fight a
purple and like they were like a ttv so then i looked at

370
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:47,330

it took them like uh one month of playing because they were

371
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:57,090
like hard stuck like red for like so long and then and then
they recently like yesterday got to purple and it took them

372
00:22:57,090 --> 00:23:04,030
like a month straight of playing Tekken to get there and I'm
like bro what it took me one week to get to red

373
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:14,490
I feel like if I commit a another week, maybe I'll learn how
to get to... Because they were... I was like looking at

and she was... I was just like...

375
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:28,670
I was like, they would play rank every day for a month
straight from red to purple.

376
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:32,790
Playing... Bro, that guy was a king player!

00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:36,830
Don't you definitely stay aggressive against her?

That guy was a king player so i was like watching because i
was like oh hey a fellow king who's in purple let me see

405
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:15,390
They don't know.

406
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:15,930
I can't play.

407
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:17,430
I literally cannot play on this side.

408
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:19,210
Like, it's actually so bad.

409
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:21,290
If they put me on this side, I'm helpless.

410
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:22,750
I'm like a sheep.

411
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:28,690
They don't know.

412
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:29,610
They don't know.

413
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:31,310
On this side, I'm scared.

414
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:39,870
The right side is where things go down.

415
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:45,470
I just don't know how to Like, okay, like my brain can't
fucking reverse the input.

416
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:48,230
That's the thing.

417
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:51,470
I have to reverse the input, and I don't know how to do
that.

418
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:54,270
Get ready for the next battle.

419
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:56,890
I don't know how to reverse inputs.

420
00:26:58,170 --> 00:26:59,830
Well, I say that before.

421
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:02,690
Because then they have to take me to the other side.

422
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:05,910
They gotta figure out how to put me on the other side.

423
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:12,310
They gotta figure it out first.

424
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:26,170
how to put me there because it's usually i put myself there
that's the thing i put myself out on the other side it's

425
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:37,110
usually not like usually not the enemy team that does it

This is my first fighting game.

433
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:23,490
You've been playing fighting games your whole fucking life.

434
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:29,330
Oh, oh, what the?

435
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:31,490
I'm just a silly joke.

436
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:32,310

437
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:35,510

440
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:46,510
How do you know that?

441
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:48,370
You can tell.

442
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:50,370
Because he knows combos.

443
00:28:52,530 --> 00:29:02,790
The most- New fighting players don't know what- People who
never play fighting games barely register your combos we

444
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:05,730
just fucking click we just press the buttons that we know
works

445
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:22,620
we just learn combos no that's just you no no all i'm saying
is if you know combos and you're still in shinri then like

446
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:31,220
you've been a fighting player for so long because like
because you just do the you just listen to what let all the

447
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:37,880
guides tell you to you know what i mean you're you don't
come up with your own strategies to climb the ranks you like

448
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:45,080
follow what the sheep you're like a sheep so you follow what
they tell you to do because it's what's right it's what's

449
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:51,300
always been but like those who are new to fighting games
they like see and don't like have like don't have like

450
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:58,840
background in fighting games we basically we come up with
our own strategies that we see that works and then abuse it

451
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:05,120
until it stops working and then we have to come up our new
with new strategies but people with fighting game experience

452
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:12,260
they just come in doing the same combos over and over and
over again and like doing the like the foundation stuff

453
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:19,160
because they're taught from fighting game experience that
that is how to do like that is like what you have to do to

454
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:28,940
climb and if i can just abuse simple buttons and just not
knowing what the fuck i'm doing and get to this elo that

455
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:31,660
means i'm not from this i'm not from this community

486
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:25,890
Wait, what?

00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:35,110
Look this is the tech in a community's fault for putting me

Yeah, never need to learn throw text if I'm doing the
throwing.

512
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:02,130
That is so true.

513
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:06,210
That is so fucking true.

514
00:35:06,890 --> 00:35:07,650
I don't know any throw.

515
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:09,470
Like, I don't know how to do any tech stuff.

516
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:12,250
All I do is grapple.

517
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:16,130
Grapple.

518
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:22,150

Accept your throws.

521
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:25,830
Accept your fate.

522
00:35:26,770 --> 00:35:28,050
You know what you're getting into.

523
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:31,870
Just lie back and think of Paris.

524
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:36,430
While I throw you to the fucking ground.

525
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:40,760

lifetime opportunity yay stay on the ground why is she
getting away with it that's what i'm saying a lot of these

539
00:36:51,660 --> 00:37:00,440
fighting players in this elo they have the sheep tell them
to do and because of that they don't know what to do when

540
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:10,860
someone does something different as in five alley kicks in a
row it's just so up they're just they're they're so confused

541
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:21,100
they're like what how is she letting you get away with this
you just don't know they're so confused when people do that

542
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:30,020
because it's so unorthodox so i just like abuse the stuff
that they don't are not used to watching in turn this kind

543
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:42,780
of oh he does that same move over and over again get let me
let me breathe let me breathe let me breathe oh my god

544
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:51,440
that's right oh you counted that that's not fair oh you
counted that too That's fine.

545
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:52,820
Oh, shit.

546
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:53,880
It's not fine.

547
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:54,520
Question?

548
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:55,380
Whoa.

549
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,600
That's my move.

550
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:01,000
Okay.

551
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:04,940
He does that all the time.

552
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:06,160
Whoa.

553
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,100
Nice.

554
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:10,440
And then I do that.

555
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:12,400
And then I rush in.

556
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:13,300
Wait, what?

557
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:17,780
There you go.

558
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:18,180
See that?

559
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:19,180
You like that little spin?

560
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,220
I did.

561
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:20,820
Oh, shit.

562
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,220
Whoops.

563
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:23,400
Oh, I still have this.

564
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:26,240
I didn't even realize I still have my heat.

565
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:28,440
Oh, no.

566
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:29,560
No.

567
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:31,540
I pressed the wrong button.

568
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:33,940
Oh, it's fine.

569
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,740
He pressed the wrong button, too.

570
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:37,320
Oh, my God.

571
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:38,740
It's so fucked up.

572
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:44,220
It would be a shame if he died like this.

573
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:44,960
Goodbye.

574
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:47,400
Fucking go back to yellow rank.

575
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,800
And you don't get a rematch.

576
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:04,700
Get outplayed.

577
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:07,360
Yay!

578
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:09,560
Yay!

579
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:09,920
Yippee!

580
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:12,320
Yay!

581
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,160
Okay.

582
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:18,880
Ugh!

583
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:19,440
Ugh!

584
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:20,540
Ugh!

585
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:20,560
Ugh!

586
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:20,580
Ugh!

587
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,140
Not toxic at all.

588
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:23,720
Oh my god, a fellow king player.

589
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:25,260
Show me.

590
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,800
This is going to be a king player to actually know his
combos.

591
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,040
Oh my god.

592
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:38,980
He actually knows how to do that.

593
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:39,980
Oh, he jumped.

594
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:40,460
I should have.

595
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,540
I need to know how to remember to.

596
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:45,500
Oh my god.

597
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:46,620
He did that thing.

598
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:48,320
My coach keeps telling me to do.

599
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:50,100
My god.

600
00:39:55,470 --> 00:39:56,650
That's fucking right.

601
00:39:56,850 --> 00:40:00,650
You should learn how to do that too Oh shit.

602
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:01,630
Oh shit.

603
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:02,130
Never mind.

604
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:02,890
I'm a king player.

605
00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:06,910
I don't know how to tech I don't know how to tech that

606
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:21,170
Oh, is he doing That sidestep he fucking knows It's not
fair.

607
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:27,790
You're also a king You know what I want to do That's fucking
right.

608
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:29,190
Oh, that's not right.

609
00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:30,110
He threw me away

610
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:49,850
Oh my god He's doing he's doing all the kick stuff I would
do back to me Who is he?

611
00:40:54,590 --> 00:41:02,230
He's in my mind What the fuck is actually in my mind?

612
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:06,970
Oh my god!

613
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:10,750
Oh my god!

614
00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:13,750
He's fucking rock paper scissoring me correctly!

615
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:18,090
That's actually crazy!

616
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:23,830
See, this is a king player that knows this shit.

617
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:27,170
But yeah, it's still an vanquisher, so that's embarrassing.

618
00:41:32,050 --> 00:41:34,050
You clearly know what you're doing!

619
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:35,790
How are you in this Elo?

620
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:41,430
You're losing it.

621
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:45,770
I don't know how he's in this vanquisher.

622
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:51,870
If he can do all that and he's still stuck in vanquisher.

623
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:01,000
Bad matchup exists too.

624
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:05,180
Okay, if bad matchup exists, how would they let me into this
Elo?

625
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:08,540
I could not get all good matchups for this.

626
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:12,640
That's all I'm saying.

627
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:14,340
That's all I'm saying, guys.

628
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:18,420
Boop.

629
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:19,260
Boop.

630
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:23,860
I lost, therefore, you should be embarrassed.

631
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:29,640
If you could do all of that, and you're still here, you're
still in vanquishing?

632
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,040
That's probably like his second...

633
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:36,020
Why would you create Smurf accounts for this?

634
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:40,880
Don't you need to pay for it?

635
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:42,920
Don't you need to buy more Tekken?

636
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:45,180
Oh, I guess if you play on console, you don't have to.

637
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:46,920
That makes sense.

638
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:50,600
If you play on console, you don't have to create new Smurf
accounts.

639
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:54,460
I was just thinking like, that's crazy.

640
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:58,500
To still win.

641
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:10,120
that's true his power level was like 145 he must have been
like a god or something in his main character and this was

642
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:11,360
just his side project

643
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:28,980
okay i know like this move and then and then i've tried to
do this correctly but i always fuck it up because it's like

644
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:37,600
there's no scenario where people would let me do that I
don't know when I can do this.

645
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:39,100
It's not fair.

646
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:44,420
Boom.

647
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:47,920
Like, this is a...

648
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,120
Oh, and then I can do this.

649
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:49,940
Yay!

650
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:56,840
Remember your training?

651
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:57,720
I am.

652
00:43:57,780 --> 00:43:58,880
I'm trying my best.

653
00:43:59,140 --> 00:43:59,860
I'm scared.

654
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:05,840
I haven't been nervous at all throughout this event until
now.

655
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:11,880
This is where I've never been so nervous before.

656
00:44:16,310 --> 00:44:16,770
Yay!

657
00:44:21,490 --> 00:44:23,690
No, because now that it matters.

658
00:44:26,810 --> 00:44:29,150
Before it didn't really matter, now it matters.

659
00:44:33,610 --> 00:44:35,270
Remember to block with one.

660
00:44:35,290 --> 00:44:36,450
What, my 30 fucking block?

661
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:37,330
Watch this.

662
00:44:38,390 --> 00:44:38,610
Oh!

663
00:44:39,170 --> 00:44:40,390
Oh, he blocked too.

664
00:44:42,470 --> 00:44:44,970
It was cool for a second, though.

665
00:44:49,130 --> 00:44:52,610
Not gonna lie, it was pretty cool when I did make it work,
though.

666
00:44:58,180 --> 00:44:58,680
Oh, God.

667
00:45:04,090 --> 00:45:05,510
Oh, my God.

668
00:45:06,250 --> 00:45:08,650
I don't know his fucking moose!

669
00:45:09,830 --> 00:45:10,150
Oh.

670
00:45:11,390 --> 00:45:29,230
here get over here oh shit let me back on the other side oh
oh no oh no he punished me oh no he punished me no let me

671
00:45:29,230 --> 00:45:45,580
back up let me back up no okay bye I think he blocks that
yeah I was gonna say I'm pretty sure he would like

672
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:46,100
fucking...

673
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,180
That's right!

674
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:52,080
Ellie kick, Ellie kick, Ellie kick!

675
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:52,660

678

I'm sorry!

679
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:04,420
I didn't mean to Ellie kick you 20 times!

680
00:46:10,850 --> 00:46:13,000
But what if I do it again?

681
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,080
Oh shit, I'm sorry.

685
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:49,200
I have a strategic way of doing my buttons.

686
00:46:55,790 --> 00:46:57,450
Oh, mashing can't get me this.

687
00:46:59,990 --> 00:47:02,610
Oh, I can't remember he's faster than me always.

688
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:08,800
He's always faster than me.

689
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:09,840
So it sucks.

690
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:10,980
Oh.

691
00:47:16,230 --> 00:47:17,770

There you go.

694
00:47:22,810 --> 00:47:23,970
I didn't fuck this up.

695
00:47:29,990 --> 00:47:30,870
Goodbye.

696
00:47:32,170 --> 00:47:33,570
Wait, he's Keishan?

697
00:47:34,510 --> 00:47:36,330
You're fucking trash.

698
00:47:39,410 --> 00:47:43,470
If you can be Keishan, I can be Keishan too.

699
00:47:45,890 --> 00:47:50,850
I got That was fucking blue?

700
00:47:51,870 --> 00:47:52,850
Imagine losing.

701
00:47:56,010 --> 00:47:57,190
Oh my god.

702
00:47:57,550 --> 00:47:59,510
I beat all fucking blue.

703
00:48:01,950 --> 00:48:02,630
Embarrassing.

704
00:48:03,290 --> 00:48:04,990
You should uninstall the game, bro.

705
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:10,110
If your whole life was Tekken 8 and you let that happen to
you, you should uninstall.

706
00:48:13,430 --> 00:48:17,030
My OG can't be this tough thing.

707
00:48:19,390 --> 00:48:42,360

absolutely destroyed by the better king player.

709
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:08,000
Yeah, I had a feeling he knew about our...

710
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,880
He would know about the fucking...

711
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:14,440
Wait, what the fuck?

712
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:18,720
Oh my god, he's an actual king player!

713
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:20,940
Boop!

714
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:27,960
He should uninstall Tekken now!

715
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:29,580
Oh, he did that thing.

716
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:30,640
I can do that, too.

717
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:32,760
Oh, I want to do that.

718
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:35,500
Oh, see, I can mirror you.

719
00:49:36,820 --> 00:49:38,440
Oh, that was an accident.

720
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:41,320
But, oh, my God, I teched it.

721
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:41,920
How?

722
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:43,280
Good question.

723
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:44,540
Yeah.

724
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:48,060
Oh, no, I teched it, too.

725
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:50,480
No, I didn't tech that.

726
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:52,460
Boop.

727
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:56,800
Bro, this is, like, the slowest fucking king player ever.

728
00:49:56,940 --> 00:49:57,660
I swear to God.

729
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:05,800
get this i had a feeling yeah i swear this is the slow i've
never seen a king player play this slow

730
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:13,560
it's actually crazy how how slow of a king player he is

731
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:21,200
a king player that thinks no way

732
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:26,340
no way

733
00:50:30,580 --> 00:50:33,420
That's actually so rare, man.

734
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:40,020
He's doing his part.

735
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:41,940
That's what I'm saying.

736
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:46,180
I've never fucking seen a king player play this slow before.

737
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:50,500
Kings are always so...

738
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:53,800
Especially, like, mirror match kings, too.

739
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:54,800
I guess, like...

740
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:55,480
Oh, wait, no.

741
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:57,980
The Kony matchup was so fucking slow.

742
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:12,360
to be fair the kony matchup with what's his name g uh that
guy the the other king player that he played he that was

743
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:18,480

Yay.

747
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:43,360
Alright, here we go.

748
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:49,700
He's almost blue and cat tech shining wizard.

749
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:59,020
I swear, these purples and blue rings are fucking easier
than the red race.

750
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:03,880
I'm gonna say that I'm absolutely destroyed by these
purples.

751
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:09,320
Thank you for taking me back to the side.

752
00:52:11,140 --> 00:52:12,180
Oh, bro, you duck.

753
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:16,460
I'm going to say that.

754
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:19,040
And now I'm going to get absolutely destroyed by this guy.

755
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:21,640
Oh, no.

756
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:22,520
Oh, no.

757
00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:23,180
Leave me alone.

758
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:24,060
Leave me alone.

759
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:24,960
Leave me alone.

760
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:28,480
Oh, goodbye.

761
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:31,160
This guy actually knows what he's doing.

762
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:36,760
Oh no.

763
00:52:36,940 --> 00:52:37,520
I'm sorry.

764
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:38,400
I'm so sorry.

765
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:39,040
I didn't mean it.

766
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:40,040
Oh, he has four wins.

767
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:41,180
He's actually serious.

768
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:44,080
Whoa, he's actually serious.

769
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:49,200
Oh, he ducks everything!

770
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:51,060
But you can't duck this!

771
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:53,220
Oh god.

772
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:54,340
Oh god, never mind.

773
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:55,100
You don't need a duck.

774
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:56,440
You can just beat the shit out of me.

775
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:00,200
Understandable.

776
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:00,600
Understandable.

777
00:53:02,620 --> 00:53:03,220
Understandable.

778
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:08,080
Oh shit.

779
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:08,500
Okay.

780
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:09,220
Understandable.

781
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:09,780
Understandable.

782
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:11,380
You hate... You hate tigers.

783
00:53:11,540 --> 00:53:12,320
You hate jaguars.

784
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:20,200
Oh shit.

785
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:21,780
Goodbye.

786
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:23,760
I guess I'll go to the moon now.

787
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:25,720
My people need me.

788
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:30,920
Oh!

789
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:32,180
He fucking went first!

790
00:53:33,340 --> 00:53:34,240
I'm sorry.

791
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:35,220
I'm so sorry.

792
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:36,900
I'm so sorry.

793
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:39,120
This is my sorry punch.

794
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:40,660
I'm so sorry.

795
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:42,440
I didn't mean to.

796
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:43,140
Oh shit.

797
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:43,700
No.

798
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:44,760
I'm so sorry.

799
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:45,200
Please.

800
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:45,960
Have mercy.

801
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:50,380
Hey.

802
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:55,600
Okay, but will he expect this?

803
00:53:55,740 --> 00:53:56,700
Oh my god!

804
00:53:57,120 --> 00:53:58,260
Who are you?

805
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:03,120
Does he attack it?

806
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:04,000
No, he doesn't.

807
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:12,760
Oh, no, I've messed it up.

808
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:16,760
Boom!

809
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:21,380
JK.

810
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:23,740
You're right, maybe not again.

811
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:24,600
You're right, you're right.

812
00:54:24,860 --> 00:54:25,220
Maybe not.

813
00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:26,200
Maybe not.

814
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:27,780
Can I please get up?

815
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:28,260
Please, sir.

816
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:29,020
Please.

817
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:30,320
Please, please.

818
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:31,100
Please.

819
00:54:39,330 --> 00:54:41,130
All right, I deserve that.

820
00:54:41,210 --> 00:54:42,370
I'm sorry for...

821
00:54:42,510 --> 00:55:02,170
the 500 shining wizards I'm so sorry oh my god I'm so I'm
sorry for all those shining wizards I didn't mean to I'm so

822
00:55:02,170 --> 00:55:08,720
sorry what's my bad

823
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:19,140
I got so cocky.

824
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:22,200
Yeah.

825
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:24,540
I got humbled.

826
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:29,140
I mean, there's a reason why my block is at 30.

827
00:55:29,780 --> 00:55:32,000
Okay, I'm going to block in this one.

828
00:55:34,220 --> 00:55:34,520
All right.

829
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,620
I'm going to block on this one.

830
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:40,680
Oh, no.

831
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:42,480
She's a fast one, too.

832
00:55:42,820 --> 00:55:43,960
They always have that ghost.

833
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:50,440
How do you guys register the fact that I don't block those.

834
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:54,220
I guess when you abuse alley kicks, that's when you know.

835
00:55:56,260 --> 00:55:56,480
Oh.

836
00:55:58,020 --> 00:56:01,580
No, I even fucking... I even tried to block.

837
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:04,380
I was actually trying to block.

838
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:07,240
What?

839
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:09,520
No!

840
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:16,880
My chat told me to try blocking, and I always knew that was
a mistake!

841
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:25,460
I'll never block again.

842
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:28,400
My chat was fucking wrong.

843
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:37,120
Oh my god.

844
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:40,000
I think the issue is that I don't know what move is what.

845
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:42,440
What is low and what isn't.

846
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:44,200
That's definitely my issue.

847
00:56:45,020 --> 00:56:45,020
Oh,

848
00:56:51,170 --> 00:56:52,090
she doesn't block that though.

849
00:56:52,110 --> 00:56:53,530
Let's go.

850
00:56:55,950 --> 00:56:56,830
Does she do it again?

851
00:56:57,310 --> 00:56:57,570
Okay.

852
00:57:00,430 --> 00:57:00,570
Oh.

853
00:57:05,820 --> 00:57:06,300
Oh.

854
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:07,740
Unlucky.

855
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:10,960
Goodbye, she grabbed my nipples.

856
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:16,080
Goodbye.

857
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:19,200
See ya, block!

858
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:20,400
Oh.

859
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,180
Yo, we got a coach match.

860
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:27,520
No, I'm sorry.

861
00:57:27,780 --> 00:57:28,440
I'm sorry.

862
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:32,100
Both teams are playing Coach Mash.

863
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:36,520
I'm watching.

864
00:57:37,340 --> 00:57:37,860
Oh, God.

865
00:57:38,180 --> 00:57:38,620
Leave me alone.

866
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:39,340
That's crazy.

867
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:40,060
Shift your butt.

868
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:40,640
Yeah!

869
00:57:41,420 --> 00:57:42,000
Goodbye.

870
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:46,820
Oh, it's a Coach tiebreaker?

871
00:57:47,060 --> 00:57:47,680
Oh, shit.

872
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:51,240
I hope I don't forget everything.

873
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:55,420
No.

874
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:56,520
Nice.

875
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:58,740
I take that one point off of purple.

876
00:57:58,880 --> 00:57:59,440
You're a purple?

877
00:58:06,770 --> 00:58:09,030
That's embarrassing for you.

878
00:58:16,740 --> 00:58:18,000
That's so embarrassing.

879
00:58:18,180 --> 00:58:20,080
You should be blocking that if you're a purple.

880
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:26,440
Okay.

881
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:28,600
All right, I'm sorry.

882
00:58:29,060 --> 00:58:30,300
But you should be blocking that.

883
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:36,900
This is gonna be close, dude.

884
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:42,280
Oh No, no, I swear I was at a low.

885
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:43,640
I'm sorry.

886
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:44,940
I'm sorry for making fun of you.

887
00:58:45,060 --> 00:58:45,740
I'm so sorry.

888
00:58:46,220 --> 00:58:46,450
I'm not

889
00:58:54,850 --> 00:58:59,530
No Okay, I'll take those.

890
00:59:00,090 --> 00:59:01,830
Oh That's okay.

891
00:59:01,910 --> 00:59:07,470
I took two rounds off a fucking purple E-rank now you should
be in my E-Lo

892
00:59:10,910 --> 00:59:14,490
You should be be in my Ilo for making that too close.

893
00:59:26,490 --> 00:59:28,590
That's some fucking bullshit right now.

894
00:59:32,030 --> 00:59:33,190
Yeah, that's way too close.

895
00:59:34,570 --> 00:59:35,270
Yeah, like what?

896
00:59:35,350 --> 00:59:36,490
I actually have 50 hours.

897
00:59:38,590 --> 00:59:40,370
I was looking at how many hours I have.

898
00:59:40,450 --> 00:59:41,910
I have 50-ish hours.

899
00:59:47,190 --> 00:59:48,770
Yeah, I have very weak defense.

900
00:59:48,990 --> 00:59:55,310
The thing is, a lot of the characters I'm playing, like a
lot of people I'm playing against, like, the worst part is,

901
00:59:55,310 --> 01:00:01,650
like, it's because they're, like, such uncommon characters
in rank, so I barely play against these types of characters.

902
01:00:02,430 --> 01:00:04,970
I think that's, like, the worst part, honestly.

903
01:00:06,430 --> 01:00:07,090
Oh, hey, it's Leon.

904
01:00:11,310 --> 01:00:12,710
Because, like, I fucking...

905
01:00:12,710 --> 01:00:13,950
I saw, like, fucking...

906
01:00:13,970 --> 01:00:21,470
my entire time in those 50 hours getting to this elo like
all the fucking ranks i's like you know from from beginner

907
01:00:21,470 --> 01:00:35,810
to red i've saw three yoshis i saw only three yoshis but i
saw fucking 200 fucking uh reina so

908
01:00:39,330 --> 01:00:41,510
like that's the worst part

909
01:00:46,260 --> 01:00:48,020
Kings were also pretty rare.

910
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:49,460
I think kings were like...

911
01:00:49,460 --> 01:00:52,500
I think I've seen like maybe like in rank.

912
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:54,140
Maybe like...

913
01:00:54,740 --> 01:00:57,720
Oh, Chesto.

914
01:00:57,980 --> 01:00:58,140
Okay.

915
01:00:58,700 --> 01:00:59,420
I'm trying to like think.

916
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:02,980
I think I've seen like maybe like 8 king players.

917
01:01:03,220 --> 01:01:03,500
10?

918
01:01:03,900 --> 01:01:04,480
I think 10.

919
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:05,620
10 king players.

920
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:08,160
King shows up more later on.

921
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:08,500
Yeah.

922
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:10,940
I fucking see like 200 reynas.

923
01:01:11,540 --> 01:01:12,720
200 reynas.

924
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:15,700
Who else do I see a lot?

925
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:17,760
I see a lot of Alyssa's too.

926
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:23,600
Okay.

927
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:26,500
Oh, I fucked up the... I fucked that up.

928
01:01:26,980 --> 01:01:27,900
I can do it again.

929
01:01:28,860 --> 01:01:29,540
There you go.

930
01:01:31,460 --> 01:01:32,300
I'm ready to rock.

931
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:35,000
I got, um, blue three back.

932
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:37,300
I'm warmed up.

933
01:01:38,380 --> 01:01:40,600
The kings and the Yoshis are in the high rings.

934
01:01:41,180 --> 01:01:43,860
Yeah, but it sucks because I don't get a chance to practice.

935
01:01:45,380 --> 01:01:47,740
I see a lot of Azus too.

936
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:56,020

01:02:32,700 --> 01:02:35,220
You just get to see King and Yoshi.

944
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:37,680
You're standing there.

945
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:42,480
Well, he almost knows how to play against Kings.

946
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:44,280
Not that.

947
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:45,120
What was it?

948
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:46,500
Matching settings.

949
01:02:47,260 --> 01:02:47,380
All right.

950
01:02:47,620 --> 01:02:48,340
I'll be right, guys.

951
01:04:39,310 --> 01:04:40,050
All right.

952
01:04:41,730 --> 01:04:42,530
Who's here?

953
01:04:43,710 --> 01:04:44,510
What's up?

954
01:04:45,570 --> 01:04:47,090
We're fighting team NYK.

955
01:04:47,690 --> 01:04:50,270
They had to do a coach match tiebreaker for it.

956
01:04:50,390 --> 01:04:50,450
Yep.

957
01:04:50,790 --> 01:04:51,610
That's a five?

958
01:04:52,650 --> 01:04:52,850
No.

959
01:04:53,730 --> 01:04:55,130
Oh, that's crazy.

960
01:04:55,330 --> 01:04:56,670
I was saying you guys watching this, right?

961
01:04:56,830 --> 01:04:57,410
I just watched both.

962
01:04:57,430 --> 01:04:57,550
Yeah, yeah.

963
01:04:57,830 --> 01:04:58,610
I'm back.

964
01:04:58,870 --> 01:05:01,110
I wasn't watching the Lily mirror.

965
01:05:01,390 --> 01:05:02,070
I'm back.

966
01:05:02,650 --> 01:05:07,490
He had like crazy scaling, so it looked like he was going to
have to win one more interaction.

967
01:05:07,630 --> 01:05:07,930
All right.

968
01:05:08,030 --> 01:05:09,410
And then he got like a wall reset.

969
01:05:09,610 --> 01:05:10,530
I'm going to have to reset the scaling.

970
01:05:10,530 --> 01:05:16,290
and he just blew her up with one move i don't know what it
was but oh he was in heat was it like the mid where she

971
01:05:16,290 --> 01:05:24,830
spins in the air and i don't think so it looked like a like
a oh hold on watch punch someone someone linked it i'm

972
01:05:24,830 --> 01:05:31,410
watching it i i was like okay so the scaling means he can't
get the kill here and then he like bounced off wall it was

973
01:05:31,410 --> 01:05:40,390
like oh okay that's like 19 i think holy he came back like
this yeah dude all right hope kick do your thing do your

974
01:05:40,390 --> 01:05:42,410
thing Do your thing.

975
01:05:42,990 --> 01:05:43,850
Another hope kick.

976
01:05:45,050 --> 01:05:45,430
Oh, no.

977
01:05:47,710 --> 01:05:48,170
No.

978
01:05:49,530 --> 01:05:51,050
Oh, what the hell?

979
01:05:51,870 --> 01:05:53,030
Miles got up incorrectly there.

980
01:05:53,190 --> 01:05:54,450
She could attack, but...

981
01:05:54,450 --> 01:05:55,070
That's what that was.

982
01:05:56,430 --> 01:05:57,910
I'm pretty... That's not guaranteed.

983
01:05:58,050 --> 01:05:58,870
Let me see it again.

984
01:05:59,430 --> 01:06:00,890
Yeah, she could attack right there.

985
01:06:03,550 --> 01:06:04,030
Okay.

986
01:06:04,150 --> 01:06:05,090
She could have got up.

987
01:06:07,010 --> 01:06:07,490
Okay.

988
01:06:07,650 --> 01:06:08,030
I think.

989
01:06:08,510 --> 01:06:08,910
I don't know.

990
01:06:08,970 --> 01:06:10,330
This game's still kind of new.

991
01:06:10,530 --> 01:06:20,250
i brought you on the sage amp thing too yeah it hits against
wall that's so weird that's a weird situation yeah yeah

992
01:06:20,250 --> 01:06:31,410
maybe it was guaranteed i'm not sure you can hold back i
think if she texts she could have got out of it all right um

993
01:06:31,410 --> 01:06:41,450
yeah the teams are playing kind of crazy i mean i believe in

Yeah, it's not as good.

1021
01:08:07,050 --> 01:08:09,470
Paying your own ticket is not as good as a free ticket.

1029
01:09:22,100 --> 01:09:24,860
Our friendship of eight years will be over for this match.

1030
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:26,640
It was time.

1031
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:29,120
It was a timer and this was it.

1032
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:31,120

01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:32,720

Wait, I know, dude.

1036
01:09:37,900 --> 01:09:39,000
It ran its course.

1037
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:41,880
It's time to end it on Tekken 8.

1038
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:49,800
I have never felt so nervous.

1039
01:09:49,820 --> 01:09:50,320
before.

1040
01:09:51,100 --> 01:09:51,560
I know, right?

1041
01:09:51,780 --> 01:09:53,120

1042
01:09:53,300 --> 01:09:53,500
Yeah.

1043

Wait, Doki, you said you've never been this nervous before?

1044
01:09:58,020 --> 01:09:59,800
No, I've never been this nervous before.

1045
01:10:00,180 --> 01:10:00,880
Never in your life.

1046
01:10:01,100 --> 01:10:04,400
No one has ever felt that way that I feel right now.

1047
01:10:05,820 --> 01:10:06,580
It's true.

1048
01:10:07,100 --> 01:10:07,640
It's true.

1049
01:10:07,740 --> 01:10:09,640
The science needs to study this new feeling.

1050
01:10:09,740 --> 01:10:10,800
Yeah, this new feeling.

1051
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:12,100
What is this feeling?

1052
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:16,400
Dude, this stage slam is pretty stressful, yeah.

1053
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:19,780
I mean, it's like really good and really bad.

1054
01:10:19,820 --> 01:10:26,220
all together like a roller coaster that we've heard of hey
we'd be feeling much worse if we didn't all have trips

1055
01:10:26,220 --> 01:10:31,200
obviously we want to get her a trip you know what i'm saying
yeah you guys should feel particularly bad if i don't get a

1056
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:42,180
trip yeah james praying for us to win so he doesn't have to
double up he should give i told him he should give like you

1057
01:10:42,180 --> 01:10:51,100
guys like a budget equivalent to the evo ticket yeah wait a

Good shit.

1124
01:13:58,020 --> 01:14:01,380

01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:03,920

1241
01:19:09,680 --> 01:19:10,360
Very close.

1242
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:11,000
Very close.

1243
01:19:12,340 --> 01:19:13,160
You ran your game.

1244
01:19:13,340 --> 01:19:14,240
You did great, honestly.

1245
01:19:14,660 --> 01:19:15,820
Oh, it's so close.

1246
01:19:16,120 --> 01:19:16,940
You did great, honestly.

1247
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:23,320
Yeah, I don't, I don't like to blow smoke, but that was
genuinely, that was good Tekken, and that's what happens.

1248
01:19:24,920 --> 01:19:27,340
And we'll clean this one up and then we'll go next.

1249
01:19:28,700 --> 01:19:29,280
Yeah, yeah.

1250
01:19:29,320 --> 01:19:32,900
At the evil run back, when Gumi is there, we'll all be lost.

1251
01:19:32,920 --> 01:19:33,260
Yeah.

1252
01:19:34,020 --> 01:19:35,560
be fucking loud in that room.

1253
01:19:35,560 --> 01:19:36,520
Yeah, I'll be like, no!

1254
01:19:37,980 --> 01:19:39,160
Fucking beat her ass!

1255
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:47,340
I don't like what I've done differently there.

1256
01:19:47,860 --> 01:19:50,120
I feel like she, like, adapted so fast, too.

1257
01:19:51,640 --> 01:19:56,880
Yeah, she hit you with the Hello Rage Arts, so, like, I
guess just block, you know, call it out, and then you get a

1258
01:19:56,880 --> 01:19:57,400
full launch.

1259
01:20:00,360 --> 01:20:02,900
Yeah, and you blocked her lows perfectly.

1260
01:20:03,140 --> 01:20:11,580
We just have to mash the four, and you ducked her three one
thing too but again yeah press the four yeah but it was good

1261
01:20:11,580 --> 01:20:22,420
you were uh defensively you were doing great i should have
kicked more maybe i should have alex next next match and for

1262
01:20:22,420 --> 01:20:29,940
the future just send it like i don't it's alex don't listen
to coach you don't know what i'm talking about this pickman

1263
01:20:29,940 --> 01:20:35,420
thing is the funniest thing i've ever seen in my life he's
immune to fire by the

1264
01:20:42,210 --> 01:20:43,330
Mm-hmm.

1265
01:20:44,050 --> 01:20:45,030
Mm-hmm.

1266
01:20:50,200 --> 01:20:51,180
Okay, it came down.

1267
01:20:57,160 --> 01:20:57,180
Nice.

1268
01:20:57,180 --> 01:20:58,820
Round two.

There you go.

01:21:54,030 --> 01:21:56,590
We are alley kick central.

1275
01:21:57,110 --> 01:21:57,410
Bro, what?

1276
01:21:57,850 --> 01:22:00,410
When you block a back one, two, back one, two, him back.

1277
01:22:00,730 --> 01:22:10,430
it's unsafe or you can even duck the second and hop kick him
sick also

1278
01:22:31,770 --> 01:22:37,270
if you jab jab he's gonna dog you can jab that pop kick him
also after running three he's gonna duck every time right

Yes!

1285
01:23:48,780 --> 01:23:50,080
He might stop now.

1286
01:23:50,240 --> 01:23:53,040
He might stop now, but it's up to you to recognize it.

1287
01:23:56,360 --> 01:23:56,840
Guaranteed.

1288
01:23:57,160 --> 01:23:57,680
Get up, bro.

1289
01:23:57,960 --> 01:23:58,760
Get up!

01:24:05,970 --> 01:24:07,390
He's doing it every time.

1291
01:24:07,550 --> 01:24:08,870
It's an easy break.

1292
01:24:11,610 --> 01:24:12,090
Fuck.

1293
01:24:12,890 --> 01:24:13,770

01:24:14,290 --> 01:24:15,770
It's okay, it's okay.

1295
01:24:16,010 --> 01:24:16,670
Walk in, goat.

1296
01:24:17,290 --> 01:24:18,250
That lean is for you.

1297
01:24:18,430 --> 01:24:18,930
Slurp it up.

1298
01:24:21,730 --> 01:24:24,090
There's no way.

1299
01:24:25,090 --> 01:24:25,850
Mep, meow.

1300
01:24:36,730 --> 01:24:37,370

Oh my god.

1306
01:24:53,170 --> 01:24:53,710
You can hold off of this.

1307
01:24:53,950 --> 01:24:54,810
Well, almost dead.

1308
01:24:58,890 --> 01:24:59,710
It's fine.

1309
01:25:07,540 --> 01:25:08,060
It's fine.

1310
01:25:11,900 --> 01:25:12,100
Nice.

1311
01:25:12,520 --> 01:25:12,980
Nice job.

1312
01:25:13,220 --> 01:25:16,240
I mean, Coney obviously mused, let's be honest here.

1313
01:25:16,420 --> 01:25:16,540
Yeah.

1314
01:25:17,100 --> 01:25:17,520
Man.

1315
01:25:19,380 --> 01:25:19,900
Yes.

1316
01:25:31,400 --> 01:25:31,920
Nice.

1317
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:32,860
I haven't gone for that yet.

1318
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:33,560
I haven't gone for that yet.

1319
01:25:38,160 --> 01:25:39,820
Let's fucking go, baby.

1320
01:25:40,360 --> 01:25:41,620
Oh, nice.

1321
01:25:41,960 --> 01:25:42,440
Nice.

1322
01:25:42,680 --> 01:25:42,960
Nice.

1323
01:25:45,580 --> 01:25:50,820
He wants to get off that stage.

1324
01:25:52,160 --> 01:25:55,020
Even though, yeah, it's a good king stage, but he's also
king.

1325
01:25:58,700 --> 01:26:00,040
Yeah, I'm going to pin this.

1326
01:26:00,180 --> 01:26:01,180
You got the reeds, man.

1327
01:26:03,240 --> 01:26:04,900
Remember, Cody, back one two.

1328
01:26:05,140 --> 01:26:06,240
You go back one, two, and back.

1329
01:26:06,520 --> 01:26:06,780
Right.

1330
01:26:07,260 --> 01:26:12,860
Yeah, that just, if he hits you twice and you block it, wop,
wop, and he explodes.

1331
01:26:12,980 --> 01:26:18,800
optimal punish is to duck the second hit and hop kick him
for it but yeah if we have him practice it just punish it oh

1332
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:22,980
good yeah and yeah he's still a ducker one one mid

1333
01:26:28,160 --> 01:26:30,880
boom baby nice

1334
01:26:40,440 --> 01:26:44,080

01:26:49,120 --> 01:26:51,840
Fuck, I tried to shiny wizard that.

That's bad.

1339
01:26:56,600 --> 01:26:57,060
I'm just mashing.

1340
01:26:57,420 --> 01:26:57,860
That's fine.

1341
01:26:58,080 --> 01:26:58,400
That's fine.

1342
01:26:59,000 --> 01:26:59,500
Reset.

1343
01:26:59,640 --> 01:27:00,820
Act like that didn't even happen.

1344
01:27:00,940 --> 01:27:02,640
That round did not happen.

1345
01:27:07,590 --> 01:27:08,870
He's not ducking anymore.

1346
01:27:11,810 --> 01:27:13,330
But now you poke, poke, grab.

1347
01:27:18,990 --> 01:27:19,750

Oh, it's okay.

1353

Round two.

1598
01:47:00,950 --> 01:47:01,310

01:47:14,430 --> 01:47:16,350
Throw him that fucking one.

1606
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:19,620
He's dead.

1607
01:47:21,860 --> 01:47:22,760
Oh, he's so good.

1608
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:23,460

1622
01:49:01,320 --> 01:49:03,000
Oh my god.

1623
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,760
If you taught me that, I could have beat Groome.

1624
01:49:07,180 --> 01:49:08,300
He said, get off that stage.

1625
01:49:08,640 --> 01:49:10,020
Get off that opulent mansion.

1626
01:49:10,180 --> 01:49:11,680
Get me out of King's house.

1627
01:49:12,280 --> 01:49:12,740
Characters.

1628
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:14,980

1629
01:49:15,480 --> 01:49:16,180
Big mistake.

1630

Get me out of that.

1631
01:49:16,900 --> 01:49:17,900
That's King's mansion.

01:49:18,360 --> 01:49:18,380

1638
01:49:26,400 --> 01:49:28,480
I don't think he's gonna play Steve again.

1639
01:49:29,840 --> 01:49:30,300
Yeah.

1640
01:49:30,960 --> 01:49:31,340

Nobody does it.

1675
01:52:47,500 --> 01:52:48,220

01:52:58,000 --> 01:52:59,400
He's trying to remind him the other day.

1682
01:52:59,480 --> 01:53:00,180
I know what you're doing.

1683
01:53:01,340 --> 01:53:06,460
And did you see how we worked that King's Gamma Hull against
the running bears?

We end right there, right?

1690
01:53:24,380 --> 01:53:24,780
That's what I'm doing.

1691
01:53:25,280 --> 01:53:25,480
We watch that.

1692
01:53:25,560 --> 01:53:26,480
Let us out of here.

1693
01:53:26,740 --> 01:53:27,340
I'm there.

1694
01:53:27,740 --> 01:53:28,500
I can't believe it.

1695
01:53:28,520 --> 01:53:29,280

1699
01:53:41,400 --> 01:53:42,540

And then we...

1704
01:53:47,020 --> 01:53:47,500
Locked, boxed.

Pissed it all out.

1706
01:53:48,520 --> 01:53:49,180

That was crazy.

1718
01:54:56,080 --> 01:54:57,540
I would like Tony to lose.

1719
01:54:58,280 --> 01:55:02,320
Actually, both of these guys have speed caves coaching them
how to beat me.

1720
01:55:02,480 --> 01:55:03,160
And it's annoying.

1721
01:55:04,520 --> 01:55:06,440
It doesn't even matter who wins.

1722
01:55:06,580 --> 01:55:08,100
What do they have against you?

1723
01:55:08,220 --> 01:55:09,440
What did you do to them?

1724
01:55:10,140 --> 01:55:11,560
I beat them in day one.

1725
01:55:13,880 --> 01:55:15,600
Dude, they're all they're talking mad shit.

1726
01:55:15,840 --> 01:55:17,260
They're like blood loss to Raidits.

1727
01:55:17,260 --> 01:55:24,900
and then everyone else lost the rateds and it's like dude oh
no no no kaiser kaiser kaiser yeah yeah yeah tony was like

1728
01:55:24,900 --> 01:55:32,040
yeah he was giving me shit for losing a kaiser and he gets
too owed and kaiser's like what do you say fuck me for

1729
01:55:35,460 --> 01:55:46,640
oh my actually the most nerve-wracking games so far i miss
round robbins i want tony to win because i want the josh

1730
01:55:46,640 --> 01:55:57,320
runback sure yeah and true fair enough don't did win i just
checked the ballad tone one the the coach match that's

1731
01:55:57,320 --> 01:56:07,020
happening right now oh yeah yeah it's a coach match tony fie
right now i'm stupid who do we want to win fie or tone i

1732
01:56:07,020 --> 01:56:13,460
think we want fie to win because tone's the strongest i
think it's easier yeah it's it's way easier for us if he

1733
01:56:13,460 --> 01:56:20,680
wins okay like like without you know respectfully cat is
tony's team is pretty like annoying like that's the esam

1734
01:56:20,680 --> 01:56:29,100
team i think right yeah yeah yeah tony's the esam like
literally no offense doki but esam no no 100 i agree so by

1735
01:56:29,100 --> 01:56:34,540
definition we want feed to win because that doesn't mean
that they get a guaranteed one win you know yeah and it's

1736
01:56:34,540 --> 01:56:45,480
about to happen oh my god let's go it's two two right now 10
fit combo hollywood fdx guys you guys want to watch isam is

1737
01:56:45,480 --> 01:56:53,940
auto one oh and then raid it's me up and like you know drag
is a huge issue for me so nice we're watching the fee match

1738
01:56:53,940 --> 01:57:05,220
right now chat this man oh my god fee fees downloaded to him
bounce good bounce oh that should have oh my god oh my

1739
01:57:05,220 --> 01:57:10,620
goodness that perfect one to zero with the cat true

1740
01:57:13,900 --> 01:57:18,940
that was a crazy counter hit Wait, but then if like...

1741
01:57:18,940 --> 01:57:20,860
Okay, but like...

1742
01:57:20,860 --> 01:57:25,420
That means Tone would be in loser bracket, so we might play
against Tone if Fee beats this.

1743
01:57:25,840 --> 01:57:26,400
Yeah, definitely.

1744
01:57:26,820 --> 01:57:28,760
If they lose, we could still play him again, yeah.

1745
01:57:29,280 --> 01:57:32,480
But we would rather fight Fee to get into Grades.

1746
01:57:32,900 --> 01:57:33,200
Yeah, okay.

1747
01:57:33,720 --> 01:57:35,760
We'd rather get that, because then we...

1748
01:57:35,760 --> 01:57:37,500
So right now, we're guaranteed at least third.

1749
01:57:37,820 --> 01:57:38,080
Yeah.

1750
01:57:38,140 --> 01:57:39,740
If we win again, we're guaranteed second.

1751
01:57:40,020 --> 01:57:44,000
Which means if we win one more set, we go to Evo,
theoretically.

1752
01:57:44,600 --> 01:57:45,980
No, it cancels out, dude.

1753
01:57:46,060 --> 01:57:46,460
Again.

1754
01:57:47,240 --> 01:57:49,740
If you win, then take your tickets away.

1755
01:57:49,760 --> 01:57:50,460
We also get home.

1756
01:57:57,450 --> 01:57:58,490
Oh, Amavi.

1757
01:58:00,790 --> 01:58:02,830
So we really want Fi to win.

1758
01:58:10,980 --> 01:58:12,780
Oh wow, that's a nice full combo.

1759
01:58:18,660 --> 01:58:19,760
Dude, Lily's broken.

1760
01:58:19,980 --> 01:58:20,500

on my part i get the vibe fee is like very what anxious

1766
01:58:45,380 --> 01:58:50,760
about his like because like he's the tech and youtube guy
and if he doesn't perform he thinks people are going to care

used to all the comments.

1772
01:59:31,060 --> 01:59:31,400
That's true.

1773
01:59:31,980 --> 01:59:32,000
Yeah.

1774
01:59:33,340 --> 01:59:36,160
It's something everyone who, like, kind of blows up has to
learn.

1775
01:59:39,100 --> 01:59:40,200
Unless you're already in the know.

1776
01:59:40,200 --> 01:59:41,180
Just turn off the monitor.

1777
01:59:41,380 --> 01:59:43,240
Oh, my God.

1778
01:59:45,880 --> 01:59:47,880

01:59:48,060 --> 01:59:48,540
Oh, my God.

1780
01:59:48,640 --> 01:59:50,180

02:07:15,140 --> 02:07:19,040
that last game and then yeah i got in my own head

1870
02:07:22,580 --> 02:07:30,960
I got into my own head and I fucked up, yeah I kept thinking
about block block block So then I forgot how to be

1871
02:07:30,960 --> 02:07:40,540
aggressive Because like that's how like I won like rounds
When I was more aggressive But oh my god I was like I was

02:07:40,540 --> 02:07:48,660
too nervous there Yeah I just gotta relax My hands, my
fingers during the round robins I was not, my fingers never

enjoying the rand robins but this is like the like the first

1874
02:07:56,180 --> 02:08:15,320
time i my hands actually were shaking i was actually shaking
and i was like yeah the pressure got to me but like um it

1875
02:08:15,320 --> 02:08:24,060
was still close it was so close i just ended up like not
punishing or doing damage i got defense i defended but i

1876
02:08:24,060 --> 02:08:32,900
didn't do anything after defending but maybe i purposely
lost so we can get that sick ass brawl pro match i don't

pro player.

1892
02:09:57,760 --> 02:09:59,580

Bro, I hate playing it.

1896
02:10:07,680 --> 02:10:10,560
We lose matches first before our match.

1897
02:10:10,800 --> 02:10:11,480
I thought they...

1898
02:10:11,480 --> 02:10:12,540
So, we got a little bit more.

1899
02:10:12,700 --> 02:10:13,420

Welcome back.

1923
02:12:44,690 --> 02:12:53,210
We gotta play against laws Not really Hey, I'm watching
stream round one.

1924
02:12:53,550 --> 02:12:54,030
I'm watching this.

1925
02:12:54,390 --> 02:13:04,390
I see you beat ESAM Yo, oh wait, he's purple wrecked just
like him Just like ESAM!

1926
02:13:04,630 --> 02:13:17,550
He's purple too Oh my god He's just like him Box box was
seven feet tall until yesterday.

1927
02:13:17,890 --> 02:13:24,910
That man is real by the way good shit in that set guys Yeah,
no matter what we're fucking top three.

1928
02:13:25,270 --> 02:13:26,970
Oh god.

1929
02:13:27,110 --> 02:13:27,710
We're in the money.

1930
02:13:28,370 --> 02:13:28,850
Oh god.

1931
02:13:28,890 --> 02:13:34,610
If this was a normal tournament I mean you just have to win
one more set whether it's winners or losers in the top two.

1932
02:13:35,070 --> 02:13:36,430
This happened to us in the first three.

1933
02:13:36,810 --> 02:13:50,350
So Yeah, we can do it bro Okay, here we go My biggest issue
with tournaments is like I know we can win like I know I can

1934
02:13:50,350 --> 02:13:54,190
beat anybody I know you guys can beat anybody, but will we
right there we go.

1935
02:13:54,350 --> 02:14:08,670
Yeah, that's that's the scary part like who's better today
Boom, boom, oh Yeah, I'm the head That's fucking right Isam

1936
02:14:10,570 --> 02:14:16,670
Go back to your original game Okay.

1937
02:14:18,210 --> 02:14:21,350
At least my company likes the game I play.

1938
02:14:22,450 --> 02:14:23,310
Wait, that's fucked up.

1939
02:14:24,050 --> 02:14:27,730
At least the game company likes it when I play their video
game.

1940
02:14:34,770 --> 02:14:36,970
You know it's true.

1941
02:14:39,050 --> 02:14:40,770
Apex never shut down anything.

1942
02:14:45,950 --> 02:14:49,890
That's like, that's why you have to use Tekken as a crutch!

1943
02:14:51,930 --> 02:14:54,910
I don't know, Isam, I don't know who you are.

1944
02:14:55,050 --> 02:14:55,870
It's just Tekken.

1945
02:15:01,030 --> 02:15:02,270
Oh, true.

1946
02:15:02,570 --> 02:15:04,930
They're talking about anti-Matman strats on Boxstream.

1947
02:15:05,610 --> 02:15:05,990
Why?

1948
02:15:06,330 --> 02:15:07,450
Okay, rematch.

1949
02:15:07,870 --> 02:15:10,610
He's not, he's not, he's just said he has it.

1950
02:15:11,650 --> 02:15:14,270
It's so funny that they're trying so hard to like...

1951
02:15:14,690 --> 02:15:23,110
prep for you specifically like why man i'm just trying to
play games because you are the nuclear weapon you are the oh

1952
02:15:23,110 --> 02:15:35,450
my god please i don't i don't adapt i'm sorry i don't just
send in the fucking weapon man i don't adapt they definitely

1953
02:15:35,450 --> 02:15:40,230
this might be the time where they've literally had enough
slams and enough time where they've labbed enough it gets

1954
02:15:40,230 --> 02:15:50,770
specifically like me style we'll see but you adapted a star
did though but you adapted with the gamma how that was the

1955
02:15:50,770 --> 02:16:00,170
biggest fuck you i've ever seen no i gotta watch i gotta
watch that back do this it's funny to see different styles

1956
02:16:00,170 --> 02:16:07,150
because like i kind of run over zintrea because i just put
on pressure but james is like slower which is better against

1957
02:16:07,150 --> 02:16:14,370
raided but worse against zintrea because he gives her more
opportunities to like get away from you yeah everyone's got

1958
02:16:14,370 --> 02:16:24,210
their own style it can work yeah yeah boom zentrea's up one
though yeah that was ugly cancans though she's popping too

1959
02:16:24,210 --> 02:16:34,730
much oh no you're not supposed to grab you just do kicks ah

1960
02:16:40,900 --> 02:16:50,020
that's all okay i did not think you would i thought you were
gonna duck please take me back to the other side please i

1961
02:16:50,020 --> 02:16:58,940
don't that's nasty man you should you should do it he does
the hop kick at the wall into the choke that's that's drop

1962
02:16:58,940 --> 02:17:05,340
kick i'm angry i'm fucking mad i don't know what else to do
with the wall i mean i'm doing the three kicks but maybe i

1963
02:17:05,340 --> 02:17:07,160
can't oh what no

1964
02:17:10,660 --> 02:17:23,320
let me leave let me get up what the fuck okay this is how
it's gonna go with me and esaf the future definitely it

1965
02:17:23,320 --> 02:17:30,920
shows the way he plays like traditional fighters you know
what i mean we saw the future yeah

1966
02:17:35,060 --> 02:17:42,460
just guessing right a lot well it's just block and then
maybe this if he starts sliding i just do this but like it's

1967
02:17:42,460 --> 02:17:54,000
so the timing is a lot his rage clip he never wants that to
happen again that's why he's just trying to stop that

1968
02:17:54,000 --> 02:18:12,550
forever yeah yeah so he plays very proper now if you take
one set from east to him he has to unplug i did as like uh

1969
02:18:12,550 --> 02:18:20,310
we talked about it yesterday the wizard is interesting i
didn't even think of oh my god he's doing that a lot fight

1970
02:18:20,310 --> 02:18:30,710
he counter hitter in her rage drive i think that was crazy i
don't know for some reason i thought it would work again i

1971
02:18:30,710 --> 02:18:32,890
was like that'd be funny if it works you know

1972
02:18:37,730 --> 02:18:46,530
i just thought it'd be funny if it worked again this one
might be done might be the end of kfm actually no they're

1973
02:18:46,530 --> 02:18:48,630
they're up one oh this should just make it one one

1974
02:18:53,090 --> 02:18:53,710
Okay, again.

1975
02:18:53,950 --> 02:18:54,490
This shit's stressful.

1976
02:18:55,330 --> 02:18:56,930
Stressful as fuck, dude.

1977
02:18:57,610 --> 02:18:59,670
I'd rather fight the rogue game than close to it.

1978
02:18:59,770 --> 02:19:00,650
Punish, though.

1979
02:19:01,810 --> 02:19:02,650
Good hop.

1980
02:19:04,930 --> 02:19:05,570
Okay.

1981
02:19:05,890 --> 02:19:06,010
There you go.

1982
02:19:06,090 --> 02:19:06,310
Okay.

1983
02:19:06,950 --> 02:19:08,290
Oh, I don't get this.

1984
02:19:09,310 --> 02:19:09,710
Please.

1985
02:19:10,050 --> 02:19:10,250
Oh.

1986
02:19:11,090 --> 02:19:11,730
Sorry.

1987
02:19:13,510 --> 02:19:13,650
No.

1988
02:19:17,060 --> 02:19:19,220
This scream that stress away.

1989
02:19:19,840 --> 02:19:19,940
Ah!

1990
02:19:22,380 --> 02:19:24,060

1991
02:19:24,540 --> 02:19:25,060
Isa!

1992
02:19:26,220 --> 02:19:27,620
Whoa, what the hell?

1993
02:19:30,700 --> 02:19:32,500
So you can duck that one.

1994
02:19:32,820 --> 02:19:33,400
Oh my gosh.

1995
02:19:33,860 --> 02:19:36,640
Okay, that dropped probably.

1996
02:19:37,060 --> 02:19:37,620
It bounced.

1997
02:19:37,960 --> 02:19:39,460
Wow, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1998
02:19:39,580 --> 02:19:42,280
Yeah, she's clutching it out.

1999
02:19:43,820 --> 02:19:45,160
Oh my god.

2000
02:19:45,220 --> 02:19:46,780
Bro, I watched some of her sets back.

2001
02:19:46,960 --> 02:19:47,740
What's the point of looking?

2002
02:19:48,480 --> 02:19:49,480
I can just smash!

2003
02:19:50,620 --> 02:19:51,920
Oh, fuck, he dropped.

2004
02:19:52,240 --> 02:19:53,180
She was toxic.

2005
02:19:53,380 --> 02:19:55,080
She was saying some shit, dude.

2006
02:19:55,540 --> 02:19:55,940
What?

2007
02:19:56,380 --> 02:19:57,880
She was being toxic.

2008
02:19:58,940 --> 02:20:02,680
She was like, get that spammer out of the fucking lobby,
spamming fucking cringe.

2009
02:20:02,760 --> 02:20:03,380
I was like, Jesus.

2010
02:20:03,820 --> 02:20:04,540
Like, oh my God.

2011
02:20:04,620 --> 02:20:05,360
Oh my God.

2012
02:20:05,420 --> 02:20:06,220
It was crazy.

2013
02:20:06,660 --> 02:20:08,560
That's just like you after you beat me, Rob.

2014
02:20:08,900 --> 02:20:10,080
I'm fucking better than you.

2015
02:20:10,240 --> 02:20:11,280
Well, I was better than you.

2016
02:20:11,280 --> 02:20:11,700
This is it.

2017
02:20:12,020 --> 02:20:12,520
Fuck this.

2018
02:20:12,960 --> 02:20:14,400

I was better though.

2020
02:20:15,320 --> 02:20:16,680
Fuck doing actual combos.

2021
02:20:16,760 --> 02:20:17,860
This is the way to go.

2022
02:20:18,260 --> 02:20:19,300
I was so annoyed, bro.

2023
02:20:19,460 --> 02:20:20,240
I was so annoyed.

2024
02:20:20,340 --> 02:20:21,760
He was just doing the same fuck.

2025
02:20:21,900 --> 02:20:23,220
I hate losing the bots, bro.

2026
02:20:23,320 --> 02:20:24,120

You fucking listen to people trying to block and everything
and do what got you into this Elo.

2035
02:21:06,180 --> 02:21:07,200
Do what's right.

2036
02:21:08,860 --> 02:21:11,900
Do fucking do what's fucking right.

2037
02:21:16,180 --> 02:21:19,200
Don't let them tell you what to do.

2038
02:21:20,680 --> 02:21:22,000
Just do what's fucking right.

2039
02:21:22,680 --> 02:21:24,060
If she finished that combo.

Oh, I'm behind.

2041
02:21:26,220 --> 02:21:27,180
Oh, she dropped it.

Do what comes naturally.

2043
02:21:37,400 --> 02:21:40,180
Yoki, you thought too much against Gumi.

2044
02:21:40,620 --> 02:21:41,800
You thought too much.

2045
02:21:42,180 --> 02:21:43,000
You were thinking.

2046
02:21:43,400 --> 02:21:44,400
And then you get it.

2047
02:21:44,600 --> 02:21:46,140
All you did was block.

2048
02:21:46,500 --> 02:21:51,200
You fucking, you were, you were not, you were known as 30
defense, Doki.

2049
02:21:51,620 --> 02:21:54,880
Not, it was not meant to be.

2050
02:21:54,880 --> 02:21:57,740
The moment I started attacking it was over.

2051
02:21:58,180 --> 02:21:58,900
He's not blocking me.

2052
02:21:59,020 --> 02:21:59,900
I was like, you're right.

2053
02:22:00,540 --> 02:22:01,440

02:23:38,360 --> 02:23:39,760
No, no, he broke my wall.

2080
02:23:39,860 --> 02:23:40,640
My floor!

2081
02:23:41,140 --> 02:23:42,140
That was mad close.

2082
02:23:42,560 --> 02:23:43,340
He broke my floor!

2083
02:23:43,880 --> 02:23:44,600
You see the chat?

2084
02:23:45,160 --> 02:23:45,940
My floor!

2085
02:23:46,440 --> 02:23:46,480
My floor!

2086
02:23:47,060 --> 02:23:47,720
My floor!

2087
02:23:48,640 --> 02:23:50,720
In the Discord chat!

2088
02:23:51,620 --> 02:23:52,520
Wait, what?

2089
02:23:52,940 --> 02:23:54,220
Look at stage one.

2090
02:23:54,500 --> 02:23:54,860
Block it.

2091
02:23:54,860 --> 02:23:55,980
is cringe.

2092
02:23:57,040 --> 02:23:58,640
Attacks are the only weakness.

2093
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:02,420
I see it, dude.

2094
02:24:02,880 --> 02:24:05,700
See, it's no blocking is fucking stupid.

2095
02:24:09,720 --> 02:24:11,100
Blocking is so fucking stupid.

2096
02:24:11,100 --> 02:24:13,540
I mean, those two elbows look like a good combo to me.

2097
02:24:13,780 --> 02:24:15,680
Blocking is so stupid.

2098
02:24:17,380 --> 02:24:19,760
A little bit of 1-2 action.

2099
02:24:20,080 --> 02:24:21,400
Still not Jack, Jesus.

2100
02:24:21,860 --> 02:24:24,240
Jack would have fucking...

2101
02:24:24,860 --> 02:24:33,660
not have would not have given me a round i'm just i just
wanted that's all i'm saying matt would not have given me

2102
02:24:33,660 --> 02:24:53,820
that round oh no oh adaption it's spamming oh no no oh my
god what did that kick bro jack jesus exactly not my jack

2103
02:24:53,820 --> 02:24:57,460
jesus Jack Jesus would have swept me so hard.

2104
02:24:58,720 --> 02:25:00,080
The Keck doesn't, like, move.

2105
02:25:00,280 --> 02:25:00,400
Hold on.

2106
02:25:00,500 --> 02:25:01,320
Let me see if I can...

2107
02:25:01,320 --> 02:25:01,740
There it goes.

2108
02:25:03,920 --> 02:25:04,960
But then...

2109
02:25:04,960 --> 02:25:08,820
Oh, my God.

2110
02:25:10,180 --> 02:25:11,880
Fighting games are funny, bro.

2111
02:25:11,980 --> 02:25:12,280
All right.

2112
02:25:13,100 --> 02:25:14,060
It's a good time.

2113
02:25:14,180 --> 02:25:15,540
It's, like, super stressful.

2114
02:25:15,560 --> 02:25:18,580
After this game, we're going to live watch with the homies.

2115
02:25:18,740 --> 02:25:20,360
The False Prophet.

2116
02:25:21,540 --> 02:25:24,520
Yeah, Matt would have gone four perfects out of this.

2117
02:25:27,120 --> 02:25:36,700
yeah if this was matt he wouldn't have let me stood up what
is wrong with you and you trying to learn jack if you can't

2118
02:25:36,700 --> 02:25:53,580
get three perfects in a row uninstall now roy shiato man he
should be the first scene oh my god dude fairlight is also i

2119
02:25:53,580 --> 02:26:01,140
knew i knew i knew but locking was never it but that guy is
he spams a lot of shoulder and he gets away with it uh in

2120
02:26:01,140 --> 02:26:10,400
his in his tier we gotta launch that like if he did it on
slime once like slime kills him like more like 80 if he has

2121
02:26:10,400 --> 02:26:17,080
heat and a wall oh roy beat fairlight apparently okay yes
you don't learn all the moves just learn like the moves you

2122
02:26:17,080 --> 02:26:23,260
can take it in feels like he's supposed to be like the shoto
right he's like the most basic character but he's got these

2123
02:26:23,260 --> 02:26:32,420
weird fucking corny like it doesn't feel like I'm losing to
a Shoto you know what I mean like it's hard to explain that

2124
02:26:32,420 --> 02:26:42,920
oh yeah he's like the weirdest Shoto I've ever seen in a
funny show no don't you wait trying to do blocking again

2125
02:26:42,920 --> 02:26:44,880
have you not learned

2126
02:26:48,060 --> 02:26:54,760
anything she must are really not comparable I just mean like
as like the default characters oh my god don't you look what

2127
02:26:54,760 --> 02:26:55,880
happened What happened to you?

2128
02:26:56,780 --> 02:26:57,220
Oh!

2129
02:27:00,420 --> 02:27:01,700
Guys, I need to stop blocking.

2130
02:27:01,920 --> 02:27:02,580
It's a good ending.

2131
02:27:04,660 --> 02:27:06,620
I need to stop blocking, guys.

2132
02:27:06,780 --> 02:27:08,100
It's actually messing me up.

2133
02:27:08,140 --> 02:27:09,040
It's a good timeline.

2134
02:27:09,220 --> 02:27:09,860
It all worked out.

2135
02:27:10,040 --> 02:27:10,580
It all worked out.

2136
02:27:10,860 --> 02:27:12,620
It's all, it actually is messing me up.

2137
02:27:13,580 --> 02:27:15,040
Stop learning blocking!

2138
02:27:16,500 --> 02:27:17,780
He knows what's in it.

2139
02:27:19,700 --> 02:27:20,280
Oh, shit.

2140
02:27:21,140 --> 02:27:22,820
I punched the wrong thing.

2141
02:27:23,060 --> 02:27:24,840
Tekken is weird because the poster boys in the heart.

2142
02:27:24,860 --> 02:27:30,500
character oh that's a good point yeah because the three
fighters like ken for you okay there you are kind of not

2143
02:27:30,500 --> 02:27:36,400
easy but like you know there you go is probably the most
demanding he's been the poster boy forever and now it's jinn

2144
02:27:36,400 --> 02:27:49,420
he's easier okay there you go oh my god oh my god let me
punch you let me punch you let me punch you maybe victor is

2145
02:27:49,420 --> 02:27:51,200
there like a legacy like this character

2146
02:27:54,860 --> 02:28:01,100
so low Paul has a high skill ceiling but I feel like new
players can pick him up though but I feel like that's really

2147
02:28:01,100 --> 02:28:06,580
good design when new players can pick him up but the ceiling
is still very high right they could stick I'm gonna step you

2148
02:28:06,580 --> 02:28:15,420
on the crouch oh I'm sorry I gotta thank King I don't
disagree bro King is not oh please good to pick up do my

2149
02:28:15,420 --> 02:28:22,300
thing in this game he's not the easiest to optimize though
you got to land all the your blue sparks nice okay right

2150
02:28:22,300 --> 02:28:28,420
stuff like you got to that i didn't mean to do that i didn't
mean at least let me get up at least let me get up bro can't

2151
02:28:28,420 --> 02:28:35,880
get carried away with the grabs because one grab is ducked
you lose half your life okay but what if i do that i

2152
02:28:35,880 --> 02:28:42,540
genuinely oh that's how you guys played so many grabs like
my brain can't like what it was doing to you like how does

2153
02:28:42,540 --> 02:28:49,780
your brain work that fast it's crazy it's just the pace of
the game really okay part of what makes it how was i too

2154
02:28:49,780 --> 02:28:58,180
slow for this look at the hands you look at the hand and you
can also that's crazy well you can judge the situation also

2155
02:28:58,180 --> 02:29:06,060
because giant swing comes out faster than the others so my
case that's right i punch you oh i don't punch you press the

2156
02:29:06,060 --> 02:29:12,840
wrong one so leave me alone and also habits oh what king
players like to go what grab they like to go for at what

2157
02:29:12,840 --> 02:29:19,400
distance i guess like if the wall i buffered it i buffer oh
i didn't buffer it because i'm go i'm not gaming anymore

2158
02:29:22,680 --> 02:29:30,060
I mean, I know that people have set up like, um, what a
block, people set up like training regiments for hand stuff.

2159
02:29:30,180 --> 02:29:33,080
And I feel like if you do that for like, you know, six
hours.

2160
02:29:33,940 --> 02:29:39,340
Maybe it'll be like, yeah, if you do it 15 minutes a day for
a week, I don't see you not getting tired of that.

2161
02:29:39,340 --> 02:29:40,880
Oh my god, how does he fucking just jab?

2162
02:29:41,080 --> 02:29:42,700
Such an easy tech to get used to.

2163
02:29:43,280 --> 02:29:44,280
Our reaction time is...

2164
02:29:44,280 --> 02:29:44,940
Okay, nice.

2165
02:29:45,080 --> 02:29:45,660
I got that.

2166
02:29:46,020 --> 02:29:46,700
I actually died.

2167
02:29:47,620 --> 02:29:48,060
Intentionally!

2168
02:29:51,200 --> 02:30:06,260
slime is doing it yesterday the day we were oh what the fuck
he just grabbed me that should be illegal oh no oh dude yeah

2169
02:30:06,260 --> 02:30:16,120
don't turn that it was funny but blocking is for fucking
pussies okay let's watch let's watch the match with

2170
02:30:16,120 --> 02:30:30,080
everybody all right let me grab the stream cool okay where
is the stream wow did my chat so much better now say jam

2171
02:30:31,300 --> 02:30:40,000
twitch all right here you go pin message

2172
02:30:44,560 --> 02:30:52,340
are they tied right now I'm watching it now look at the
bottom the check marks at the bottom they'll tell you oh

2173
02:30:52,340 --> 02:31:00,980
it's one to one yep yeah yeah this shit's close everything's
going final game it's unbelievable which is crazy dude who

2174
02:31:00,980 --> 02:31:13,100
do we want to win Roy Chiado is a nerd so the other team oh
okay well I think they brought us close the only person we

2175
02:31:13,100 --> 02:31:20,640
didn't on Roy's team didn't we only lose to Roy no I lost to
Logan Logan like Logan beat me once and then I lost to Logan

2176
02:31:20,640 --> 02:31:27,560
on the second because they he hard studied uh king yeah so
she beat him first time he beat her second time I'll beat

2177
02:31:27,560 --> 02:31:37,260
Zentrea probably I mean I assume um you know Roy's very good
I forget who the fourth seed on KFM's team is um uh did we

2178
02:31:37,260 --> 02:31:44,520
beat him yeah I know that's the guy yeah oh yeah he beat oh
yeah yeah he was the one that beat him yeah

2179
02:31:47,680 --> 02:31:59,580
actively play against hey best case scenario we fight scar's
team sure so we want nyk to win i don't want to fight james

2180
02:31:59,580 --> 02:32:13,480
chen again man yeah but like i i'm too low bro for the one
time you guys gotta carry my ass but looking hard studied

2181
02:32:17,680 --> 02:32:18,620
We got it.

2182
02:32:18,760 --> 02:32:22,580
We'll lock in I mean this isn't losers.

2183
02:32:22,800 --> 02:32:24,120
This is assuming we lose to Tony.

2184
02:32:24,280 --> 02:32:27,640
We could just win beat Tony in that That's funny.

2185
02:32:28,480 --> 02:32:33,980
I was just in replay system studying the fuck out of box box
It's their fucking fourth.

2186
02:32:34,360 --> 02:32:35,820
It's fucking ESAM dude.

2187
02:32:35,860 --> 02:32:36,720
It's so annoying.

2188
02:32:36,860 --> 02:32:38,040
What is he doing there?

2189
02:32:38,660 --> 02:32:45,660
Okay, if I take like one round off of him, I should just win
I know you should just tell him that I should just win.

2190
02:32:45,980 --> 02:32:53,860
That's not fair I told Seijam that after the whole thing is
done, I want to do an exhibition Tekken Ball.

2191
02:32:54,800 --> 02:32:56,840
An exhibition Tekken Ball?

2192
02:32:57,060 --> 02:33:00,540
I don't know who wants to Tekken Ball me, but someone's
going to get bald on.

2193
02:33:06,550 --> 02:33:08,150
Kaiser and Fear also won one.

2194
02:33:08,690 --> 02:33:09,750
That's crazy, dude.

2195
02:33:11,530 --> 02:33:14,970
Wait, who are we playing against if we lose to Tone?

2196
02:33:16,410 --> 02:33:17,790
I don't know if we know yet.

2197
02:33:18,190 --> 02:33:18,650
We don't know.

2198
02:33:20,590 --> 02:33:30,190
this bracket has to play a different person right i think so
i've honestly forgotten loser this gets uh fifth and are out

2199
02:33:30,190 --> 02:33:36,730
oh okay so then yeah it's gonna be them versus whoever
whoever wins the other loser bracket right and then we fight

2200
02:33:36,730 --> 02:33:45,910
then we fight then who's in the okay so out of all four
teams that hit the wall geez right i don't even know who is

2201
02:33:45,910 --> 02:33:56,770
in the losers right now i mean obviously fee if it's fee
guys on fee kaiser and then miles and yk right oh amaz is

2202
02:33:56,770 --> 02:34:09,850
like fucking destroying scar right now he's destroying this
man yeah alissa is a crack character like if when matt loses

2203
02:34:09,850 --> 02:34:17,510
to amaz that's supposed to be a 60 40 i think for jack but
that's why it hurts more when you lose and you got the

2204
02:34:17,510 --> 02:34:23,690
favorable matchup bit just a little bit yeah but i just
didn't know the matchup last time i've gone and studied oh

2205
02:34:23,690 --> 02:34:32,250
yeah brock pro actually coached him this time i saw it with
my own hands still lose i saw it at six four doki was there

2206
02:34:32,250 --> 02:34:42,770
she heard it yeah i'm the i'm the witness why is scar
getting hit by that hop kick like that because no one knows

2207
02:34:42,770 --> 02:34:50,870
alissa bro what the kind of character has a double hitting
hop kick why is she always in the air rip her wings out like

2208
02:34:50,870 --> 02:34:56,050
that shit happened to no one's played Tekken 7 before in
their life let's be real here everyone who's played Tekken 7

2209
02:34:56,050 --> 02:35:05,290
is old as fuck in your chat whoa who played Tekken 7
actually I played Tekken 7 oh okay so you're old as fuck I

2210
02:35:05,290 --> 02:35:12,490
played it for this is 100 hours this has got to hurt like
being the guy that like like if Scar loses this like the

2211
02:35:12,490 --> 02:35:18,630
code doesn't knock you out of the tournament you're out of
the you know what I mean yeah that's not a suck oh my god

2212
02:35:19,970 --> 02:35:30,130
that's oh I am telling you that team is fucking godlike no
yeah but then they still have to fight the other the other

2213
02:35:30,130 --> 02:35:40,930
two or like the other what team yeah I think I can think of
Oz now I know you can take him I should have lost this one

2214
02:35:40,930 --> 02:35:47,790
but yeah you can absolutely win he'll be a scar situation
where he fucks on me you know oh remember at the wall he

2215
02:35:47,790 --> 02:35:50,070
loves That down 4, 1 plus 2.

2216
02:35:51,190 --> 02:35:51,930
Scar doesn't know how to punish.

2217
02:35:52,110 --> 02:35:53,270
That sucks for him.

2218
02:35:53,910 --> 02:35:57,250
Wait, so how do I block the slide from Law again?

2219
02:35:57,470 --> 02:35:58,450
You just block.

2220
02:35:58,550 --> 02:36:02,090
When he's mid-range and crouching from mid-range, he's
probably going to do it.

2221
02:36:02,310 --> 02:36:03,710
Then you just down back.

2222
02:36:04,030 --> 02:36:04,610
Down back.

2223
02:36:04,810 --> 02:36:05,010
Okay.

2224
02:36:05,190 --> 02:36:09,430
Yeah, you block low and then you mash 4, just like Yoshi.

2225
02:36:10,070 --> 02:36:10,410
Okay.

2226
02:36:11,010 --> 02:36:13,530
And then he'll go in the air and then you can decide what to
do after.

2227
02:36:13,790 --> 02:36:15,170
It's not enough time to tell you.

2228
02:36:16,750 --> 02:36:18,630
But technically, that's supposed to lead into a con.

2229
02:36:18,650 --> 02:36:20,870
If you block slide, it's supposed to be a combo.

2230
02:36:22,310 --> 02:36:23,770
When you block it, it's spam alley kick.

2231
02:36:24,510 --> 02:36:25,190
If you want.

2232
02:36:25,570 --> 02:36:25,910
There you go.

2233
02:36:26,150 --> 02:36:26,390
Yeah, yeah.

2234
02:36:26,610 --> 02:36:27,290
Spam alley kick.

2235
02:36:27,550 --> 02:36:27,730
Okay.

2236
02:36:27,930 --> 02:36:29,330
All I do is just spam alley kicks.

2237
02:36:30,070 --> 02:36:30,070
Okay.

2238
02:36:30,170 --> 02:36:30,570
Yeah.

2239
02:36:30,770 --> 02:36:31,110
Block it.

2240
02:36:31,250 --> 02:36:32,470
When you block it, it's coming.

2241
02:36:33,310 --> 02:36:34,750
Block it if you think it's coming.

2242
02:36:34,930 --> 02:36:37,150
And then afterwards, spam the fuck out of alley kick.

2243
02:36:39,930 --> 02:36:41,730
Oh, he might win from this.

2244
02:36:41,890 --> 02:36:44,070
Dude, look how many times he does the fucking float low.

2245
02:36:44,270 --> 02:36:45,230
I'm telling you, man.

2246
02:36:45,570 --> 02:36:45,810
Yeah.

2247
02:36:45,930 --> 02:36:48,450
The most flow chart, Alyssa, I've ever seen in my life.

2248
02:36:48,650 --> 02:36:58,370
i wonder if they talk dude i'm sure they did because like
you and i were talking last night you know like i fucking

2249
02:36:58,370 --> 02:37:05,910
you know how i feel dude all this fucking jack does is spam
grabs like you know this i know they've said all i do is

2250
02:37:05,910 --> 02:37:14,990
spam grabs too at some point we're playing king you're king
we are talking mad shit i know everybody does

2251
02:37:18,650 --> 02:37:31,290
least like at least apex supports tournaments oh my god the
image dude victor oh the one one needs to be ducked look at

2252
02:37:31,290 --> 02:37:43,810
that gray life oh oh my god oh scott ride doesn't know he
blocked oh my goodness okay wait wait a minute wait a minute

2253
02:37:43,810 --> 02:37:47,530
signs of wait a minute signs of eight hours dream he's
waking up he's waking up

2254
02:37:52,080 --> 02:37:52,700
Almost.

2255
02:37:55,420 --> 02:37:57,160
Those are four highs in a row.

2256
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:01,340
That's minus 14.

2257
02:38:02,120 --> 02:38:03,060
That low mid.

2258
02:38:03,800 --> 02:38:05,020
That's like minus 30.

2259
02:38:05,980 --> 02:38:07,560
I went in the replay system.

2260
02:38:10,780 --> 02:38:11,560
Oh my god.

2261
02:38:11,860 --> 02:38:12,820
Goodbye, Skara.

2262
02:38:13,800 --> 02:38:14,540
Oh, good.

2263
02:38:14,720 --> 02:38:15,500
But it's over.

2264
02:38:16,060 --> 02:38:17,280
At least he knows how I felt.

2265
02:38:17,820 --> 02:38:19,220
It's over.

2266
02:38:19,600 --> 02:38:20,640
He knows how I felt.

2267
02:38:21,040 --> 02:38:21,340
Goodbye.

2268
02:38:22,280 --> 02:38:25,940
This is the first team where it's not a coach match, right?

2269
02:38:26,020 --> 02:38:26,600
Yeah, yeah.

2270
02:38:26,660 --> 02:38:27,500
They were able to 3-0.

2271
02:38:28,880 --> 02:38:31,340
To be fair, they had to play against Roy.

2272
02:38:32,680 --> 02:38:34,840
Roy Chata, which is a free win for them.

2273
02:38:35,340 --> 02:38:35,740
Yeah.

2274
02:38:37,340 --> 02:38:42,220
It feels like a lot of the tiers have a free win in their
tier.

2275
02:38:42,800 --> 02:38:43,200
Yeah.

2276
02:38:43,340 --> 02:38:43,620
You know what I mean?

2277
02:38:43,900 --> 02:38:45,380
Like they got the first seed.

2278
02:38:45,820 --> 02:38:47,340
Roy Chata, they got the third seed.

2279
02:38:47,880 --> 02:38:48,680
You guys got me.

2280
02:38:48,980 --> 02:38:51,020
Not eco, but you know, let's be real.

2281

2289
02:39:51,400 --> 02:39:52,120
Oh, Eddie, moment.

Oh, my God.

2292

All right.

02:39:55,860 --> 02:39:57,480
Well, we can all tap on this one.

2294
02:39:57,700 --> 02:39:57,840
Okay.

2295
02:39:58,100 --> 02:39:58,800
We have that.

2296
02:39:59,600 --> 02:39:59,640
Okay.

2297

Here, the bracket, I guess I can post it in our chat.

2298
02:40:04,240 --> 02:40:04,500
Okay.

2299
02:40:10,340 --> 02:40:11,180
There you go.

2300
02:40:15,080 --> 02:40:18,440
What's the score on the other loser bracket?

2301
02:40:20,640 --> 02:40:23,080
Does anyone know what the score is on the other loser
bracket?

02:40:23,320 --> 02:40:24,240

2303
02:40:24,260 --> 02:40:25,580
Oh, it's in the challenge.

2304
02:40:26,120 --> 02:40:26,360

Chalong.

2307
02:40:29,860 --> 02:40:32,060
I didn't know people used Chalong still.

2308
02:40:32,880 --> 02:40:34,780
They didn't even update it.

2309
02:40:36,960 --> 02:40:37,900
Womp, womp.

2310
02:40:38,420 --> 02:40:39,480

2311
02:40:40,940 --> 02:40:42,460
Chat, who's winning right now?

2312
02:40:43,060 --> 02:40:43,640
I don't know.

2313
02:40:43,780 --> 02:40:44,480
They don't have the overlay.

2314
02:40:44,480 --> 02:40:45,060
Fierke Kaiser.

2315
02:40:47,160 --> 02:40:48,920
Don't worry, my chat will stream tonight for me.

2316
02:40:49,900 --> 02:40:51,020
Oh, they pulled up the overlay.

2317
02:40:51,920 --> 02:40:52,400
Oh, nice.

2318
02:40:52,480 --> 02:40:53,300
Oh, wait, it's the wrong one.

pasta to be fair you have to have very high iq to press 3s

2329
02:42:28,600 --> 02:42:35,740
3d the timing is extremely subtle and with a solid grasp of
frame data most of the kicks will whiff there's also three

2330
02:42:35,740 --> 02:42:44,760
he's optimistic outlook which is definitely woven into his
kicks his personal philosophy draws heavily from Jose

2331
02:42:44,760 --> 02:42:54,820
literature, for instance, the fans understand this stuff,
the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the difficulty

2332
02:42:54,820 --> 02:42:58,580
of hitting the combo to realize that it's not just hard.

2333
02:43:02,790 --> 02:43:03,750
Okay, that's good.

2334
02:43:04,230 --> 02:43:05,170
Whoever wrote that.

2335
02:43:05,330 --> 02:43:09,530

off on me.

You know what I mean?

2347
02:44:08,710 --> 02:44:14,770
When he punches his teammate those are the alley kicks just
like I wanted to make it, but I didn't have time

2348
02:44:17,850 --> 02:44:19,190

02:50:12,570 --> 02:50:13,650
Kony just showed it.

2415
02:50:13,750 --> 02:50:14,250
Oh, my God.

2416
02:50:14,350 --> 02:50:15,750
If Kony just showed it, what's the point?

2417
02:50:18,950 --> 02:50:19,510
Okay.

2418
02:50:23,290 --> 02:50:24,350
What's the point?

2419
02:50:24,530 --> 02:50:25,550
He already showed it!

2420
02:50:31,210 --> 02:50:33,750
What the fuck is the point?

2421
02:50:35,730 --> 02:50:37,090
Thanks, Kony.

2422
02:50:39,610 --> 02:50:40,010
Alright.

2423
02:50:42,850 --> 02:50:43,090
Oh!

2424
02:50:44,070 --> 02:50:44,290
Ah!

2425
02:50:50,570 --> 02:50:51,570
Is everybody in?

2426
02:50:52,030 --> 02:50:53,670
Two, four, two, three.

2427
02:50:54,010 --> 02:50:54,430
Oh, wait.

2428
02:50:54,930 --> 02:50:57,590
We don't even have, like, majority of players in here.

2429
02:51:01,800 --> 02:51:02,820
Ah, ah.

2430
02:51:05,600 --> 02:51:07,620
Wait, that's not 543.

2431
02:51:08,080 --> 02:51:09,120
They changed it, guys.

2432
02:51:09,160 --> 02:51:10,620
They changed the passcode last minute.

2433
02:51:11,000 --> 02:51:15,420
It was 5434 when I was putting the password in, guys.

2434
02:51:15,580 --> 02:51:17,520
They just changed it last second, chat.

2435
02:51:17,600 --> 02:51:20,380
You just didn't see it because my screen was hidden.

2436
02:51:25,040 --> 02:51:27,140
It was such a fast passcode.

2437
02:51:27,160 --> 02:51:27,780
would change.

2438
02:51:27,900 --> 02:51:30,020
Because they're like, oh my god, Kony leaked the password.

2439
02:51:30,500 --> 02:51:32,080
So then they changed it, guys.

2440
02:51:34,360 --> 02:51:40,260
They changed it before we could, you know, before I could
tell you guys the new password.

2441
02:51:46,160 --> 02:51:46,740
I would never.

2442
02:51:47,360 --> 02:51:49,360
How dare you guys think I would lie?

2443
02:51:51,360 --> 02:51:53,180
Doki would never do that to you.

2444
02:51:54,800 --> 02:51:56,240
Doki is the way of life.

2445
02:51:57,040 --> 02:52:08,060
The first commandment in the Doki lore is that shall not lie
and by that i mean you guys shouldn't lie to me all right

2446
02:52:08,060 --> 02:52:21,260
here we go again let's get it fellows here we go they say
don't start oh oh okay it's okay guys i'm like the appetizer

2447
02:52:21,260 --> 02:52:23,340
before the main meal

2448
02:52:30,640 --> 02:52:31,360
Let's go.

2449
02:52:33,940 --> 02:52:38,320
Let's get Kony can watch me and just be like, okay, I should
not do that.

2450
02:52:38,580 --> 02:52:39,540
No, I'll be inspired.

2451
02:52:39,840 --> 02:52:42,240
More kicks, more kicks, more kicks.

2452
02:52:42,420 --> 02:52:42,880
Lots of kicks.

2453
02:52:43,400 --> 02:52:45,460
Now I beat James Chen, the Chen Destroyer, true.

2454
02:52:46,460 --> 02:52:47,280
Oh my gosh, wait.

2455
02:52:47,460 --> 02:52:49,120
You're right, our coach is in the interview.

2456
02:52:49,380 --> 02:52:50,600
He's not here to give us tips.

2457
02:52:50,620 --> 02:52:51,940
He's too busy in an interview.

2458
02:52:57,070 --> 02:52:58,610
Oh my god.

2459
02:52:58,650 --> 02:52:59,210
Wait, what the fuck?

2460
02:52:59,310 --> 02:53:00,370
This guy's labbing against me.

2461
02:53:00,490 --> 02:53:00,990
Hold on.

2462
02:53:01,010 --> 02:53:01,970
Get this guy.

2463
02:53:03,250 --> 02:53:07,470
Oh my god.

2464
02:53:13,090 --> 02:53:14,210
Can't believe it.

2465
02:53:14,850 --> 02:53:17,790
The coaches aren't even here to coach us.

2466
02:53:18,150 --> 02:53:19,050
What do I do?

2467
02:53:22,530 --> 02:53:24,030
Stop hitting a joint.

2468
02:53:24,390 --> 02:53:24,790
Never.

2469
02:53:26,870 --> 02:53:27,390
Never.

2470
02:53:28,730 --> 02:53:30,430
I'm gonna join forever.

2471
02:53:32,590 --> 02:53:33,570
It's not my fault.

2472
02:53:35,610 --> 02:53:37,070
I can't believe it.

2473
02:53:38,150 --> 02:53:39,110
They're doing an interview?

2474
02:53:39,350 --> 02:53:39,790
Stop!

2475
02:53:40,070 --> 02:53:42,570
It's not- I'm more important.

2476
02:53:49,190 --> 02:53:51,490
So how was the labbing going?

2477
02:53:52,250 --> 02:53:55,150
You like pulled up the replays I fought against him
yesterday.

2478
02:53:56,410 --> 02:53:58,170
You should pull up the replays too.

2479
02:53:58,290 --> 02:54:00,530
I did before he did, I'm actually...

2480
02:54:00,530 --> 02:54:00,690
Yeah!

2481
02:54:03,890 --> 02:54:04,430
Alright.

2482
02:54:04,750 --> 02:54:06,230
Does anyone know where Isam lives?

2483
02:54:06,350 --> 02:54:07,790
Can someone pull his plug?

2484
02:54:08,230 --> 02:54:08,530
Florida.

2485
02:54:10,040 --> 02:54:11,210
Don't talk, Isam.

2486
02:54:11,530 --> 02:54:13,870
This is a joke for legal reasons.

2487
02:54:14,330 --> 02:54:15,330
It's widely known.

2488
02:54:15,570 --> 02:54:16,170
Oh, okay.

2489
02:54:16,470 --> 02:54:19,690
For legal reasons, please don't go to Isam's place.

2490
02:54:21,850 --> 02:54:25,210
I just knew the right answer, so I want a teacher to pick
me.

2491
02:54:28,290 --> 02:54:28,670
That's okay.

2492
02:54:29,090 --> 02:54:36,110
But if suddenly there is a power outage in wherever Isam
lives in the district that he lives, we were not part of the

2493
02:54:36,110 --> 02:54:36,710
problem.

2494
02:54:37,190 --> 02:54:38,150
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2495
02:54:46,430 --> 02:54:47,550
Come on.

2496
02:54:54,120 --> 02:54:55,720
Are you still in the interview?

2497
02:54:56,340 --> 02:54:57,360
I guess they are.

2498
02:55:00,680 --> 02:55:03,080
For legal reasons, that was a joke.

2499
02:55:03,480 --> 02:55:05,240
And all I said was a power outage.

2500
02:55:05,760 --> 02:55:13,580
If God suddenly sent a power outage to florida then him
losing was meant to be

2501
02:55:19,000 --> 02:55:27,960
it was just meant to be true

2502
02:55:33,900 --> 02:55:36,860
jack jesus hear my prayers

2503
02:55:40,180 --> 02:55:51,480
have a rat chew the power cables hear my my prayers Jack
Jesus send that rat in amen

2504
02:55:55,540 --> 02:56:07,000
all right sorry they pulled me in for an interview that's
why I was gone what did you say about us good things right

2505
02:56:07,000 --> 02:56:14,680
uh they didn't ask me anything about in they just asked us
what they pulled you into interview and didn't even ask

2506
02:56:14,680 --> 02:56:15,720
about us

2507
02:56:20,100 --> 02:56:27,940
the kind of james bald james bald we talked about that by
the way just so you know we talked about like yeah for two

2512
02:57:14,740 --> 02:57:16,920
This guy really wants to go.

2513
02:57:17,520 --> 02:57:18,540
Okay, good try, good try.

2514
02:57:21,880 --> 02:57:23,900
You guys will deny it for me, right?

2515
02:57:24,920 --> 02:57:25,700
Yeah, of course.

2516
02:57:26,820 --> 02:57:27,680
Oh my god.

2517
02:57:28,400 --> 02:57:30,660
He's doing the down two, three, oh my god.

2518
02:57:30,820 --> 02:57:31,760
What does that mean?

2519
02:57:33,700 --> 02:57:34,140
Nothing.

2520
02:57:34,280 --> 02:57:34,900
Don't listen to me.

2521
02:57:35,020 --> 02:57:35,560
Don't listen to me.

2522
02:57:37,180 --> 02:57:38,260
He's very good.

2523
02:57:38,360 --> 02:57:39,180
It means he's very good.

2524
02:57:39,300 --> 02:57:40,380
Oh, that makes sense.

2525
02:57:40,480 --> 02:57:41,940
I could feel it right now.

2526
02:57:44,380 --> 02:57:47,040
It definitely... No, he's doing that thing!

2527
02:57:49,660 --> 02:57:50,990
Oh my god, please don't slide.

2528
02:57:54,100 --> 02:57:57,240
He is the online law player.

2529
02:57:58,880 --> 02:57:59,720
We found him.

2530
02:57:59,780 --> 02:58:00,280
He's real.

2531
02:58:02,540 --> 02:58:03,520
Oh my god.

2532
02:58:05,940 --> 02:58:08,040
Isam fights like you owe him hair.

2533
02:58:11,780 --> 02:58:13,000
That's pretty good.

2534
02:58:13,980 --> 02:58:14,860
Oh, back three!

2535
02:58:15,220 --> 02:58:15,520

2537
02:58:17,320 --> 02:58:18,000
Here we go!

2538
02:58:18,160 --> 02:58:18,800
Back three!

2539
02:58:20,140 --> 02:58:20,520
Boom!

2540
02:58:21,960 --> 02:58:22,840
Just down the kick, you get hit.

2541
02:58:24,140 --> 02:58:25,280
I did it!

2542
02:58:25,560 --> 02:58:26,100
It's over.

2543
02:58:26,340 --> 02:58:26,840
You got one!

2544
02:58:27,040 --> 02:58:28,320
Alright, it's over.

2545
02:58:28,720 --> 02:58:29,460
End this game now.

2546
02:58:29,560 --> 02:58:30,180
I won the round.

2547
02:58:30,480 --> 02:58:31,180
Oh, just to leave.

2548
02:58:31,480 --> 02:58:31,760
Just to leave.

2549
02:58:32,240 --> 02:58:33,980
Oh no, he's doing that now.

2550
02:58:37,600 --> 02:58:38,820
That's fucking right!

2551
02:58:39,780 --> 02:58:40,260
Fucking nerd.

2552
02:58:40,580 --> 02:58:41,480
Fucking nerd!

2553
02:58:41,740 --> 02:58:42,280
You slide!

2554
02:58:42,500 --> 02:58:43,840
Nobody likes it!

2555
02:58:45,980 --> 02:58:47,540
Get his ass!

2556
02:58:47,760 --> 02:58:48,240

2557
02:58:49,360 --> 02:58:49,840

2560
02:58:52,700 --> 02:58:52,900
Oh, shit!

2561
02:58:54,720 --> 02:58:55,960
Oh, no, he's doing that thing.

2562
02:58:57,080 --> 02:58:58,000
Oh, good dog.

2563

He's not dead.

2573
02:59:11,940 --> 02:59:12,800
He's not dead.

2574
02:59:12,900 --> 02:59:13,480
He's not dead.

2575

2578
02:59:52,120 --> 02:59:59,420

block that right if you hold back yeah does the slide no

2579
02:59:59,420 --> 03:00:07,700

just donkey honestly you played that extremely well oh my

2580
03:00:07,700 --> 03:00:11,740

a perfect

2581
03:00:15,920 --> 03:00:16,500
You win.

2582
03:00:16,900 --> 03:00:18,540
Like, yeah, like, kind of well...

2583
03:00:18,540 --> 03:00:19,060
I'm serious.

2584
03:00:19,460 --> 03:00:20,480
I'm gonna do that then.

2585
03:00:20,820 --> 03:00:21,700
Because that's all he's doing.

2586
03:00:22,120 --> 03:00:22,940
Like, King.

2587
03:00:23,260 --> 03:00:26,360
All I'm saying is it's very embarrassing that he let me win
two rounds.

2588
03:00:27,300 --> 03:00:30,480
Doki, remember we talked about you can low parry that slide
too?

2589
03:00:30,760 --> 03:00:31,560
We talked about that?

2590
03:00:31,900 --> 03:00:33,060
I mean, you can do that.

2591
03:00:33,160 --> 03:00:34,720
The down forward square?

2592
03:00:35,640 --> 03:00:37,660
No, no, just down forward is the low parry.

2593
03:00:37,700 --> 03:00:38,700
Oh, down forward, okay.

2594
03:00:40,400 --> 03:00:41,100
Down forward.

2595
03:00:41,100 --> 03:00:42,140
Down forward, not down forward.

2596
03:00:42,400 --> 03:00:43,220
I don't want to confuse.

2597
03:00:43,260 --> 03:00:44,540
Just hold down and you'll block it.

2598
03:00:44,920 --> 03:00:45,360
Yeah.

2599
03:00:45,460 --> 03:00:45,900
Yeah.

2600
03:00:45,920 --> 03:00:47,300
Just hold down, you'll block it.

2601
03:00:47,680 --> 03:00:50,460
You almost beat him when he got so much free damage off
that.

2602
03:00:50,560 --> 03:00:51,480
It was basically a free round.

2603
03:00:51,580 --> 03:00:52,000
Of course.

2604
03:00:52,560 --> 03:00:53,420
Dude, it's Pikachu.

2605
03:00:54,080 --> 03:00:54,860
Oh, my God, it is!

2606
03:00:55,440 --> 03:00:55,940
Mob kiss.

2607
03:00:56,240 --> 03:00:57,200
Oh, my God.

2608
03:00:57,540 --> 03:00:57,820
That's fine.

2609
03:00:57,980 --> 03:00:58,300
That's still damage.

2610
03:00:58,580 --> 03:00:58,840
His teeth?

2611
03:00:58,940 --> 03:00:59,580
That's fine, too.

2612
03:01:00,400 --> 03:01:01,240
Wait, what the fuck?

2613
03:01:01,740 --> 03:01:02,980
Wait, he's actually adapting.

2614
03:01:03,780 --> 03:01:04,840
What is wrong with him?

2615
03:01:05,920 --> 03:01:06,560
A lot of things.

2616
03:01:06,660 --> 03:01:07,700
No, this guy's fucking weird.

2617
03:01:08,640 --> 03:01:11,100
Who the fuck adapts in the fighting game?

2618
03:01:11,640 --> 03:01:12,220
What are we doing?

2619
03:01:12,500 --> 03:01:13,200
I know!

2620
03:01:13,800 --> 03:01:15,080
Oh, nice throw.

2621
03:01:16,640 --> 03:01:17,480
Does he duck?

2622
03:01:17,760 --> 03:01:19,100
Oh, he does duck now.

2623
03:01:19,460 --> 03:01:20,500
Duck Lord.

2624
03:01:21,220 --> 03:01:21,580
Chew.

2625
03:01:22,640 --> 03:01:23,180
Yawn.

2626
03:01:23,300 --> 03:01:24,020
I'm scared.

2627
03:01:24,860 --> 03:01:26,130
Yeah, you should be.

2628
03:01:27,360 --> 03:01:29,560
Losing two rounds to a B2B?

2629
03:01:29,700 --> 03:01:29,920
Boom!

2630
03:01:30,960 --> 03:01:32,880
Go back to Smash Bros.

2631
03:01:39,280 --> 03:01:40,360
Oh shit.

03:01:41,200 --> 03:01:41,260
Oh shit.

2633
03:01:41,260 --> 03:01:41,340
Oh shit.

2634
03:01:41,340 --> 03:01:42,520
I need to remember that he does.

2635
03:01:44,700 --> 03:01:45,760
Oh, he missed it.

2636
03:01:45,920 --> 03:02:06,260

cooked right now

2639
03:02:27,340 --> 03:02:35,180

felt it from his monitor yeah right you went last round last

2640
03:02:35,180 --> 03:02:44,220

embarrassing that he lost the two rounds there he had to he

2641
03:02:44,220 --> 03:02:48,700
had to change his stride not that much better Oh, it's
better.

2642
03:02:50,940 --> 03:02:51,640
Unironically, yeah.

2643
03:02:52,580 --> 03:02:53,840
I accidentally left the session.

2644
03:02:54,440 --> 03:02:54,960
Give me a sec.

2645
03:02:56,300 --> 03:03:00,520
Remember, Kony, if he ever does the spinny low on you, mash
four.

2646
03:03:01,020 --> 03:03:01,280
Right.

2647
03:03:01,700 --> 03:03:01,800
Yep.

2648
03:03:02,140 --> 03:03:05,020
Also, like, if you think he's going to do it, it's hop
kickable, you know.

2649
03:03:05,500 --> 03:03:05,780
Yep.

2650
03:03:06,820 --> 03:03:10,000
And back four to one is a high.

2651
03:03:10,080 --> 03:03:11,600
The third hit is a high, right, Kony?

2652
03:03:12,080 --> 03:03:13,560
A duck and a hop kick up.

2653
03:03:13,840 --> 03:03:14,600
But I'm going to have to wait.

2654
03:03:14,720 --> 03:03:16,420
This last time I got fucked up because I got countered.

2655
03:03:16,720 --> 03:03:17,940

Thank you.

2664
03:03:53,940 --> 03:03:54,480
He should be embarrassed.

2665
03:03:58,620 --> 03:04:01,420
He literally, I was looking at the Discord.

2666
03:04:01,940 --> 03:04:06,880
He was in the Seijam Slam Discord from morning to night
yesterday.

2667
03:04:07,380 --> 03:04:08,180
Fucking practicing.

2668
03:04:08,480 --> 03:04:10,000
It was actually crazy.

2669
03:04:12,360 --> 03:04:18,840
I was literally watching, like, I was looking at the server
and like, he was there just Tekken.

2670
03:04:18,860 --> 03:04:19,140
Okay.

2671
03:04:21,520 --> 03:04:23,100
Oh, there you go.

2672
03:04:23,600 --> 03:04:24,820
He went for the fucking stupid move.

2673
03:04:25,580 --> 03:04:26,380
You got that shit.

2674
03:04:29,160 --> 03:04:30,000
That's counter hit.

2675
03:04:30,440 --> 03:04:31,860
Oh, fuck.

2676
03:04:32,560 --> 03:04:32,760

Nice job.

Let's go.

2681
03:04:40,540 --> 03:04:41,620
Break his streak.

2682
03:04:42,140 --> 03:04:43,120
Oh, my God.

2683
03:04:43,800 --> 03:04:44,940
Oh, my God.

2684
03:04:45,080 --> 03:04:45,120
He's a dunker.

2685
03:04:45,120 --> 03:04:45,680
He's a dunker.

2686
03:04:49,260 --> 03:04:52,320
Oh, what a matter of hit, Cody.

2687
03:04:55,010 --> 03:04:56,410
Yeah, get the fuck up.

2688
03:04:58,130 --> 03:04:58,590
Okay.

2689
03:04:58,870 --> 03:04:59,510
Oh, nice.

2690
03:05:00,230 --> 03:05:01,130
Hold back to get up.

2691
03:05:02,490 --> 03:05:02,890
Nice.

2692
03:05:03,250 --> 03:05:03,490
Wake up.

2693
03:05:04,130 --> 03:05:05,630
I'm, like, five seconds behind.

2694
03:05:07,130 --> 03:05:07,930
Yeah, I'm pretty behind, too.

2695
03:05:08,090 --> 03:05:08,390
Nice.

2696
03:05:08,850 --> 03:05:09,450
Obviously, we left there.

2697
03:05:09,830 --> 03:05:10,750
Like, obviously, you got that.

2698
03:05:10,890 --> 03:05:13,190
We can only think about what's happening.

2699
03:05:13,530 --> 03:05:13,730
Yeah.

2700
03:05:13,930 --> 03:05:15,670
If I close my eyes, I can see it.

2701
03:05:16,930 --> 03:05:19,070
Just close your eyes and think about it.

2702
03:05:30,840 --> 03:05:31,440

03:06:29,910 --> 03:06:33,050
I remember, Kony, after that grab, if he grabs you, just
hold back to get up.

2710
03:06:33,170 --> 03:06:33,930
Those kicks won't hit you.

2711
03:06:34,510 --> 03:06:35,110
You got it.

2712
03:06:37,650 --> 03:06:38,010

Oh my fucking goodness.

2722
03:07:03,940 --> 03:07:05,600
That's the real counterplay to that.

2723

Does he get up correctly from shoulder?

2732
03:07:32,390 --> 03:07:33,210
He does not.

2733
03:07:33,950 --> 03:07:34,550

2737
03:07:41,150 --> 03:07:41,470
All right.

2738
03:07:42,730 --> 03:07:43,610
R1 start.

2739
03:07:46,010 --> 03:07:46,450
Nice.

2740
03:07:46,990 --> 03:07:48,070
That's such a good combo.

2741
03:07:49,250 --> 03:07:50,670
Coach, why didn't you teach me that combo?

2742
03:07:51,230 --> 03:07:52,190
I tried to.

2743
03:07:52,330 --> 03:07:53,470
You have trouble with it.

2744
03:07:54,370 --> 03:07:55,950
You can try hiding.

2745
03:07:56,330 --> 03:07:58,070
Oh my God, he's got a lot of giants.

2746
03:07:58,250 --> 03:07:58,770
Oh my God.

2747
03:07:59,190 --> 03:08:00,190
He can't do the wall.

2748
03:08:01,870 --> 03:08:08,070
let's go oh my god it's just a red pickman he's not even a
flower pickman yeah

2749
03:08:14,090 --> 03:08:20,890
after you're running three coney you can hop kick this guy
and also he's not ducking so you can do shining wizards now

2750
03:08:20,890 --> 03:08:28,430
because right right right yeah but again if you hit him with
a running three from long range he's gonna do down two every

2751
03:08:28,430 --> 03:08:33,990
time well that's what he's doing yeah yeah literally the
only time he didn't do it was that final final hit every

2752
03:08:33,990 --> 03:08:41,750
time you've hit plus frames he does down too my read is plus
frames hop kick but you know up to you of course get ready

2753
03:08:41,750 --> 03:08:48,990

really that's up to you to make the adjustment

2755
03:09:15,360 --> 03:09:21,460
clean oh okay okay okay yeah okay that means that he's
willing to rage art another time just keep that yes yeah

2756
03:09:21,460 --> 03:09:27,180
that means that he will kill himself later get

2757
03:09:32,490 --> 03:09:40,450
rage art here right fuck yeah I forgot yeah as soon as you
said that was like shit I know I know what I said wouldn't

Round four.

2771

That's okay.

2776
03:11:03,000 --> 03:11:06,400
It's all right.

2777
03:11:06,400 --> 03:11:06,580
Yeah.

2778
03:11:08,620 --> 03:11:10,800
My read is next time you're even a little bit enraged.

We believe in you.

2822
03:13:19,750 --> 03:13:22,790
How hard, how, how fast is your heart beating right now?

2823
03:13:24,550 --> 03:13:25,910
It's so frustrating.

2824
03:13:27,210 --> 03:13:28,590
I feel like you need it.

2825
03:13:28,710 --> 03:13:30,710
Dragon all this is so frustrating, bro.

2826
03:13:31,450 --> 03:13:34,030
I feel like you need a fucking drink after that.

2827
03:13:35,450 --> 03:13:36,430
Oh, I can't spectate.

2828
03:13:36,430 --> 03:13:38,590
All right, let's get it, Slon.

2829
03:13:39,090 --> 03:13:40,250
I'm going to restream Kony.

2830
03:13:41,070 --> 03:13:41,910
It's not letting me in the lobby.

2831
03:13:45,150 --> 03:13:46,970
Oh my god, no, it's Brian.

2832
03:13:50,270 --> 03:13:51,790
He's a dick punch man, right?

2833
03:13:56,060 --> 03:13:56,900
Uh, no.

2834
03:13:58,680 --> 03:14:00,400
He's the guy that goes dick, dick, dick, dick, dick.

2835
03:14:00,480 --> 03:14:01,700
Yeah, he's a dick punch man!

2836
03:14:02,520 --> 03:14:04,080
And he sometimes goes cock.

2837
03:14:06,300 --> 03:14:07,040
Oh, yeah.

2838
03:14:11,360 --> 03:14:12,320
Good shit.

2839
03:14:12,680 --> 03:14:13,140
Okay.

2840
03:14:14,340 --> 03:14:15,300
Good shit.

2841
03:14:15,740 --> 03:14:16,700
We wait for that.

2842
03:14:19,620 --> 03:14:20,440
We break it.

2843
03:14:20,880 --> 03:14:22,160
I'm sure there's another move.

2844
03:14:22,700 --> 03:14:23,120
It's all good.

2845
03:14:23,260 --> 03:14:23,680
It's all good.

2846
03:14:24,320 --> 03:14:24,800
We're still up.

2847
03:14:30,740 --> 03:14:31,660
Radar happens.

2848
03:14:31,900 --> 03:14:32,540
That's just knowledge.

2849
03:14:33,780 --> 03:14:35,180
Slime recognize the wall splats.

2850
03:14:35,440 --> 03:14:37,100
You could have won after your back one wall splats.

2851
03:14:37,720 --> 03:14:37,940
Okay.

2852
03:14:41,240 --> 03:14:45,200
If the wall is on that side and you're back one, just think
about it.

2853
03:14:47,320 --> 03:14:48,360
Very close.

2854
03:15:05,400 --> 03:15:06,180
Wow, what a block.

2855
03:15:11,740 --> 03:15:12,660
That was a crazy block.

2856
03:15:24,380 --> 03:15:26,720
Send the rage guard when he's about to win.

2857
03:15:26,860 --> 03:15:27,760
He's pressuring like that.

2858
03:15:27,820 --> 03:15:28,260
It will work.

2859
03:15:35,870 --> 03:15:36,390
Nice.

2860
03:15:36,750 --> 03:15:37,070
Nice.

2861
03:15:37,410 --> 03:15:37,590
Nice.

2862
03:16:03,420 --> 03:16:03,900
Nice!

2863
03:16:04,360 --> 03:16:05,220
Eat him!

2864
03:16:05,640 --> 03:16:06,680
Big dude!

2865
03:16:10,710 --> 03:16:11,570
Nice slime.

2866
03:16:20,980 --> 03:16:21,600
Nice slime.

2867
03:16:22,460 --> 03:16:26,480
What was the orbital fucking hit me there?

2868
03:16:38,460 --> 03:16:39,620
That's fine, that's fine, that's fine.

2869
03:16:39,800 --> 03:16:40,220
It's fine.

2870
03:16:40,500 --> 03:16:42,300
We have another set.

2871
03:16:42,640 --> 03:16:46,240
He does let the fucking rage art rip, and I think you should
rip it too.

2872
03:16:49,080 --> 03:16:50,020
You gotta set the tone.

2873
03:17:16,700 --> 03:17:17,780
Oh!

2874
03:17:19,480 --> 03:17:20,260
Insane!

2875
03:17:25,730 --> 03:17:27,230
That's crazy I apologize.

2876
03:17:29,070 --> 03:17:29,950
Yeah, that was a whiff punish.

2877
03:17:49,740 --> 03:17:50,820
Oh.

2878
03:17:50,820 --> 03:17:51,380
Round two.

2879
03:17:52,160 --> 03:17:52,740
Fight.

2880
03:18:05,620 --> 03:18:06,700
Oh.

2881
03:18:12,880 --> 03:18:13,960
Oh.

2882
03:18:13,960 --> 03:18:14,060
Oh.

2883
03:18:14,060 --> 03:18:14,640

2887
03:19:08,640 --> 03:19:09,220
It's all good.

2888
03:19:09,400 --> 03:19:09,700
Let it go.

2889
03:19:09,700 --> 03:19:10,100
It's okay.

2890
03:19:10,140 --> 03:19:10,400
It's okay.

2891
03:19:11,660 --> 03:19:12,260
It's okay.

2892
03:19:55,070 --> 03:19:55,870
Nice try.

2893
03:19:56,030 --> 03:19:56,350
Nice try.

2894
03:19:56,390 --> 03:19:56,450
Nice try, dude.

2895
03:19:56,630 --> 03:19:56,890
Nice try.

2896
03:19:59,690 --> 03:20:00,490
All right.

2897
03:20:00,730 --> 03:20:02,170
I'm going to try a bit.

2898
03:20:03,410 --> 03:20:06,270
Honestly, last night, Boxbox beat the fuck out of me, so.

2899
03:20:06,850 --> 03:20:08,430
Use what he got you with, though.

2900
03:20:08,530 --> 03:20:09,430
Use what he got you with.

2901
03:20:09,770 --> 03:20:09,970
Yeah.

2902
03:20:10,530 --> 03:20:11,650
You got it this time, dude.

2903
03:20:12,250 --> 03:20:12,650
Yeah.

2904
03:20:12,950 --> 03:20:15,970
He showed his cards, so now you know exactly his moves.

2905
03:20:17,010 --> 03:20:18,250
Until he starts adapting.

2906
03:20:18,490 --> 03:20:19,230
I'll be right back.

2907
03:20:28,330 --> 03:20:30,050
The one in the last coaches.

2908
03:20:30,310 --> 03:20:32,570
Did Brawl Pro 1 or did their coach 1?

2909
03:20:33,330 --> 03:20:34,190
During Round Robins.

2910
03:20:34,350 --> 03:20:35,430
One 1 between the two of them.

2911
03:20:35,470 --> 03:20:35,990
Oh, okay.

2912
03:20:36,410 --> 03:20:36,810
Yeah.

2913
03:20:42,860 --> 03:20:43,640
It's time.

2914
03:20:43,760 --> 03:20:45,380
Make it to the coaches match.

2915
03:20:46,980 --> 03:20:48,800
Bring us to the coaches match.

2916
03:20:50,420 --> 03:20:50,700
Oh.

I believe in you, Matt.

2919
03:20:59,640 --> 03:21:02,080
I will try.

2920
03:21:02,460 --> 03:21:03,060
Don't throw up.

2921
03:21:04,580 --> 03:21:05,620
I will also try.

2922
03:21:05,860 --> 03:21:08,960
A lot of things I'm trying here.

2923
03:21:37,130 --> 03:21:37,530
Shit.

2924
03:21:37,830 --> 03:21:37,990
Okay.

2925
03:21:38,630 --> 03:21:39,810
That's how we started back up.

2926
03:21:40,330 --> 03:21:41,290
Still have heat, too.

2927
03:21:41,930 --> 03:21:42,330
Nice.

2928
03:21:45,390 --> 03:21:45,990
Good shit.

2929
03:21:46,090 --> 03:21:46,770
It's a lot of damage.

2930
03:21:51,780 --> 03:21:52,420
He got up, run.

2931
03:21:54,500 --> 03:21:55,100
Good shit.

2932
03:21:55,340 --> 03:21:55,860

2933
03:21:56,640 --> 03:21:56,980
Okay.

2934
03:21:57,160 --> 03:21:58,460
I'm gonna see this in...

2935
03:21:58,460 --> 03:21:58,560
Jesus Christ.

2936
03:21:58,900 --> 03:22:00,220
I'm gonna see this in five seconds.

2937
03:22:00,360 --> 03:22:00,600

2939
03:22:04,260 --> 03:22:05,700
Oh, we gotta launch those four twos.

2940
03:22:06,140 --> 03:22:06,640
Yeah, I bet.

2941
03:22:13,960 --> 03:22:14,480
Nice.

2942
03:22:14,480 --> 03:22:16,340
Keep it going.

2943
03:22:17,700 --> 03:22:18,220
Nice.

2944
03:22:20,640 --> 03:22:22,560
I cannot believe that's safe.

2945
03:22:23,160 --> 03:22:24,120
I cannot believe that's safe.

2946
03:22:25,300 --> 03:22:26,340
Ha ha!

2947
03:22:28,000 --> 03:22:28,520

Jack it real good.

2957
03:22:52,600 --> 03:22:55,300
And you were worried!

2958
03:23:00,940 --> 03:23:03,140
I gotta pull up my Tony notes.

2959
03:23:03,540 --> 03:23:07,040
I gotta pull them up right now.

2960
03:23:07,480 --> 03:23:08,220
Sorry, coach.

2961
03:23:08,600 --> 03:23:09,220
Sorry, coach.

2962
03:23:09,240 --> 03:23:10,780
Hey, are you going in?

2963
03:23:11,400 --> 03:23:12,120
Are you going to death it?

2964
03:23:12,260 --> 03:23:13,480
Are you going to...

2965
03:23:13,480 --> 03:23:15,460
No, we'll let her rock.

2966
03:23:16,380 --> 03:23:17,020
You gotta do.

2967
03:23:17,160 --> 03:23:17,820
It's winners.

2968
03:23:18,060 --> 03:23:18,720
We'll let her rock.

2969
03:23:19,080 --> 03:23:21,340
You try to ice me like fucking Goichi, man.

2970
03:23:23,440 --> 03:23:24,840
It's Dragon Ball Fighters all over again.

2971
03:23:24,900 --> 03:23:25,420
Why'd you go bad?

2972
03:23:25,600 --> 03:23:26,880
He's on his Goichi shit, bro!

2973
03:23:27,280 --> 03:23:28,400
Like, what the fuck?

2974
03:23:28,960 --> 03:23:30,160
He wants the switch sides.

2975
03:23:30,200 --> 03:23:31,280
He wants the switch sides.

2976
03:23:31,400 --> 03:23:31,940
I can't.

2977
03:23:32,060 --> 03:23:32,760
I can't.

2978
03:23:35,320 --> 03:23:36,120

Nice!

2983
03:24:14,460 --> 03:24:15,360
Okay, release.

03:24:16,240 --> 03:24:16,780
That's fine.

2985
03:24:17,640 --> 03:24:18,920
Oh no, I took 30.

2986
03:24:20,220 --> 03:24:20,880

2989
03:24:23,860 --> 03:24:25,480

all the life is back and she's dead?

2993
03:24:44,800 --> 03:24:45,680
Oh my god.

Look, look, Matt, there's a reason why you're not the coach.

3094
03:34:09,150 --> 03:34:09,610
Yes.

3095
03:34:10,190 --> 03:34:11,150
Oh my god.

3096
03:34:11,350 --> 03:34:12,610
What a crazy two hit.

3097
03:34:12,970 --> 03:34:13,070
Jesus.

3098
03:34:13,630 --> 03:34:14,650
Oh my god.

3099
03:34:15,930 --> 03:34:16,290
Watch it.

3100
03:34:16,350 --> 03:34:16,730
The RDC?

3101
03:34:17,110 --> 03:34:17,290
Oh, okay.

3102
03:34:17,430 --> 03:34:18,230
Break is fucking on.

3103
03:34:18,490 --> 03:34:19,030
Oh my god.

3104
03:34:19,110 --> 03:34:19,670
Look at that break.

3105
03:34:20,030 --> 03:34:20,210
Oh.

3106
03:34:20,590 --> 03:34:22,590
Somebody needs to talk to the coach.

3107
03:34:23,210 --> 03:34:23,710
Oh!

3108
03:34:26,410 --> 03:34:28,150
Get up, Freaky Brian.

3109
03:34:29,690 --> 03:34:30,730
Fine, it's a little bit.

3110
03:34:49,460 --> 03:34:50,140
Yes!

3111
03:34:55,540 --> 03:34:57,000
Oh my goodness.

3112
03:34:58,560 --> 03:34:59,960
Let's go, dude!

3113
03:35:00,420 --> 03:35:00,740
Yes!

3114
03:35:00,980 --> 03:35:01,600
Let's go!

3115
03:35:03,500 --> 03:35:04,020
Maybe.

3116
03:35:10,810 --> 03:35:12,710
I'm gonna close my eyes.

3117
03:35:14,570 --> 03:35:15,070
Come on.

3118
03:35:25,580 --> 03:35:26,700
Oh, he's him.

3119
03:35:27,300 --> 03:35:28,520
Wait, what the fuck?

3120
03:35:29,800 --> 03:35:30,880
He's doing magic tricks.

3121
03:35:32,040 --> 03:35:35,000
Oh my goodness, back at the wall you go.

3122
03:35:37,060 --> 03:35:37,120
What?

3123
03:35:37,120 --> 03:35:37,160
What?

3124
03:35:37,360 --> 03:35:38,180
Oh my god.

3125
03:35:38,500 --> 03:35:38,640
Oh my god.

3126
03:35:38,640 --> 03:35:39,660
That's a fucking bait.

3127
03:35:40,000 --> 03:35:40,820
Are you serious?

3128
03:35:41,500 --> 03:35:42,880
What a fucking bait.

3129
03:35:42,880 --> 03:35:42,920
What a fucking bait.

3130
03:35:42,920 --> 03:35:43,420
What do you see?

3131
03:35:43,440 --> 03:35:44,160
What do you see?

3132
03:35:44,940 --> 03:35:46,100
What a babe!

3133
03:35:46,320 --> 03:35:47,360
What is that background?

3134
03:35:49,360 --> 03:35:50,940
He's a fucking beast, dude.

3135
03:35:51,160 --> 03:35:51,900
Back out if you have to.

3136
03:35:52,140 --> 03:35:52,800
Back out if you have to.

3137
03:35:53,080 --> 03:35:53,660
That's our coach!

3138
03:35:53,880 --> 03:35:54,600
That's our coach!

3139
03:35:54,840 --> 03:35:56,160
Good fucking shit, dude.

3140
03:35:57,320 --> 03:35:58,380
I'm just running it back.

3141
03:35:58,480 --> 03:36:00,580
He's backing out to switch stages each time.

3142
03:36:00,920 --> 03:36:02,560
But I mean, I'm cool with it.

3143
03:36:03,160 --> 03:36:04,740
Let's just make sure he doesn't pick.

3144
03:36:05,120 --> 03:36:05,880
Make sure he doesn't pick.

3145
03:36:06,020 --> 03:36:06,740
It has to say random.

3146
03:36:07,580 --> 03:36:11,040
You did it before you could do it again.

3147
03:36:11,320 --> 03:36:12,480
If it doesn't say random, call him out.

3148
03:36:12,600 --> 03:36:12,940
Disqualified.

3149
03:36:13,400 --> 03:36:14,240
You know you can fight.

Let's go, dude.

3156
03:37:04,800 --> 03:37:05,940
Go, coach!

3157
03:37:06,480 --> 03:37:06,840

3158
03:37:07,880 --> 03:37:08,800
Fuck him up!

3159
03:37:11,620 --> 03:37:12,500

03:37:13,140 --> 03:37:13,980
You're straight up better.

3161
03:37:16,600 --> 03:37:17,580
You're a fucking better face.

3162
03:37:18,700 --> 03:37:19,400
Be scared of you.

3163
03:37:19,800 --> 03:37:20,740
He is scared shitless.

3164
03:37:21,520 --> 03:37:22,260
Make him depressed.

3165
03:37:23,180 --> 03:37:24,220
And who wouldn't be?

3166
03:37:24,220 --> 03:37:25,220
Who wouldn't be scared?

3167
03:37:25,380 --> 03:37:26,000
I'd be pretty scared.

3168
03:37:26,160 --> 03:37:26,900

03:38:08,200 --> 03:38:09,080

Oh my god.

3184
03:38:31,500 --> 03:38:31,980

3187
03:38:34,380 --> 03:38:34,960
Let's go!

3188
03:38:35,540 --> 03:38:36,560
You are my god!

3189
03:38:36,580 --> 03:38:38,380
Oh my god!

3190
03:38:38,380 --> 03:38:40,020
He's going to Evo!

3191
03:38:40,340 --> 03:38:41,780
He's going to Evo!

3192
03:38:41,960 --> 03:38:43,300
He's going to Evo!

3193
03:38:44,480 --> 03:38:45,780
That's so funny!

3194
03:38:46,100 --> 03:38:46,920
The good time!

3195
03:38:47,380 --> 03:38:49,940
It's strong for me!

3196
03:38:50,420 --> 03:38:51,200
Oh my god!

3197
03:38:51,820 --> 03:38:53,340
You literally have a smash!

3198
03:38:53,920 --> 03:38:54,860
Oh my god!

3199
03:38:54,980 --> 03:38:57,820
The second go!

3200
03:38:59,160 --> 03:38:59,960
The word!

3201
03:39:01,020 --> 03:39:02,240
I fucking love this guy.

3202
03:39:03,320 --> 03:39:05,000
He's doing it every time!

3203
03:39:05,160 --> 03:39:06,560
Every time he does it!

3204
03:39:06,580 --> 03:39:07,060
How?

3205
03:39:07,320 --> 03:39:09,080
How does he do it every time?

3206
03:39:10,100 --> 03:39:11,280
Oh my god!

3207
03:39:11,420 --> 03:39:11,940
I'm shivering.

3208
03:39:12,280 --> 03:39:13,000
You tripping me, bro!

3209
03:39:13,560 --> 03:39:16,640
I didn't think it was possible for me to have this feeling
since last slam.

3210
03:39:16,800 --> 03:39:17,880
It's again, it's all over again.

3211
03:39:17,980 --> 03:39:18,560
Oh my god!

3212
03:39:18,580 --> 03:39:19,100
Keep two trips, baby!

3213
03:39:19,280 --> 03:39:20,340
Keep two trips!

3214
03:39:22,440 --> 03:39:24,020
You might have ESAM.

3215
03:39:24,020 --> 03:39:24,320
I don't care.

3216
03:39:24,620 --> 03:39:25,580
Like, put us in second.

3217
03:39:25,680 --> 03:39:26,280
I don't fucking care.

3218
03:39:26,460 --> 03:39:26,880
I don't care.

3219
03:39:27,920 --> 03:39:31,360
You might have ESAM, but you can't even beat our coach!

3220
03:39:31,680 --> 03:39:34,280
They have to win two sets now if they get to it.

3221
03:39:34,420 --> 03:39:35,520
Anybody has to win two sets.

3222
03:39:35,600 --> 03:39:36,420
We fucking got it, dude.

3223
03:39:36,580 --> 03:39:37,120
Yeah!

3224
03:39:39,460 --> 03:39:39,860
I...

3225
03:39:39,860 --> 03:39:41,060
I do not care.

3226
03:39:41,140 --> 03:39:42,280
Play your losers, come back.

3227
03:39:42,600 --> 03:39:43,380
Who the fuck cares?

3228
03:39:43,500 --> 03:39:44,360
That was Tekken.

3229
03:39:44,460 --> 03:39:45,260
It's literally guaranteed.

3230
03:39:45,380 --> 03:39:47,100
Why do you want to fight me again, Boxbox?

3231
03:39:49,640 --> 03:39:50,500
No, dude.

3232
03:39:50,600 --> 03:39:51,360
I might fight you later.

3233
03:39:51,580 --> 03:39:51,880
I can't.

3234
03:39:53,580 --> 03:39:54,320
He's about to adapt.

3235
03:39:54,540 --> 03:39:54,960
Oh my god.

3236
03:39:55,460 --> 03:39:56,080
Oh my god.

3237
03:39:56,260 --> 03:39:56,780
What a thrill.

3238
03:39:56,960 --> 03:39:57,280
I'm done.

3239
03:39:57,360 --> 03:39:58,620
He's so fucking good, dude.

3240
03:39:58,700 --> 03:40:00,000
He's so fucking good, man.

3241
03:40:00,040 --> 03:40:01,220
That was insane.

3242
03:40:02,180 --> 03:40:03,000
Good shit, everybody.

3243
03:40:03,180 --> 03:40:04,160
I'm shaking, man.

3244
03:40:04,360 --> 03:40:04,780
Let's go.

3245
03:40:05,000 --> 03:40:05,300
Let's go.

3246
03:40:06,580 --> 03:40:07,380
Everybody here.

3247
03:40:07,600 --> 03:40:08,260
Good shit, man.

3248
03:40:08,260 --> 03:40:09,440
Oh my god.

3249
03:40:12,720 --> 03:40:13,760
Holy shit.

3250
03:40:14,020 --> 03:40:15,060
Fucking wow.

3251
03:40:15,360 --> 03:40:16,660
Oh, I'm sweating.

3252
03:40:17,020 --> 03:40:19,980
I had to close my eyes during some of those moments.

3253
03:40:20,220 --> 03:40:21,660
That was so fucking scary.

3254
03:40:22,260 --> 03:40:24,240
By definition, too hard to watch.

3255
03:40:24,720 --> 03:40:26,340
Oh, it's so tense.

3256
03:40:27,520 --> 03:40:29,780
Now imagine being the one who had to play that.

3257
03:40:31,260 --> 03:40:33,180
I, dude, it happened again.

3258
03:40:33,360 --> 03:40:34,880
We are the goats once more.

3259
03:40:35,040 --> 03:40:36,280
We are so fucking awesome.

3260
03:40:37,620 --> 03:40:39,040
Bro, bro, how did you feel?

3261
03:40:39,220 --> 03:40:40,660
How did you feel, bro, bro?

3262
03:40:41,020 --> 03:40:41,940
What do you mean?

3263
03:40:42,260 --> 03:40:43,460
It feels good.

3264
03:40:43,960 --> 03:40:46,300
It feels good now, but what do you mean?

3265
03:40:46,820 --> 03:40:48,640
I'm shaking the whole time.

3266
03:40:48,860 --> 03:40:50,680
I'm having like a seizure the whole thing.

3267
03:40:51,520 --> 03:40:52,720
You're fucking different, bro.

3268
03:40:52,900 --> 03:40:53,440
You're different.

3269
03:40:53,740 --> 03:40:54,160
You're different, bro.

3270
03:40:54,440 --> 03:40:54,680
Seriously.

3271
03:40:54,980 --> 03:40:56,520
He was so scared at the end.

3272
03:40:56,580 --> 03:40:57,800
You had him backing up, dude.

3273
03:40:58,020 --> 03:40:58,420
Yeah.

3274
03:40:58,900 --> 03:41:02,340
Yeah, the pressure fucking, you changed the tide.

3275
03:41:02,500 --> 03:41:02,960
You really did.

3276
03:41:03,020 --> 03:41:03,980
You can see it.

3277
03:41:04,080 --> 03:41:04,880

made it without all of us we would not have had that buy we

3314
03:44:24,160 --> 03:44:31,060
coffee so proud of you guys man seriously this Could you
imagine the timeline when we were on different teams?

3315
03:44:31,240 --> 03:44:31,820
I wouldn't have cared.

3316
03:44:32,280 --> 03:44:34,420
No, I really wouldn't have been the same vibes.

3317
03:44:34,560 --> 03:44:34,980
It would not.

3318
03:44:35,300 --> 03:44:36,520
I told you guys this.

3319
03:44:36,700 --> 03:44:39,240
Like, when I entered this one, they said we probably
wouldn't be together.

3320
03:44:39,380 --> 03:44:40,820
And I was like, alright, I'm not really going to try.

3321
03:44:41,100 --> 03:44:43,040
But, like, dude, I fucking cared.

3322
03:44:43,660 --> 03:44:45,240
I'm 100% the same.

3323
03:44:45,380 --> 03:44:49,460
Like, if I had any different teammates, like, I had a
different team, I would have been like, yeah, okay.

3324
03:44:49,720 --> 03:44:51,220
I'll try, but, you know, we cared.

3325
03:44:51,380 --> 03:44:52,620
But now it's just not the same.

3326
03:44:52,760 --> 03:44:54,200
And it really meant something.

3327
03:44:54,480 --> 03:44:56,340
And now Doki's here to fucking experience it.

3328
03:44:56,340 --> 03:44:56,640
Yeah.

3329
03:44:56,640 --> 03:44:57,360
One of the best teammates I've had.

3330
03:44:58,880 --> 03:45:02,000
I think if I was in any other team, I wouldn't be as hyped
for sure.

3331
03:45:02,140 --> 03:45:03,660
I would have voted in.

3332
03:45:06,100 --> 03:45:10,560
Seriously, unironically, we could have gotten somebody that
didn't vibe like you're in the family.

3333
03:45:11,080 --> 03:45:11,900
Seriously, you're in the family.

3334
03:45:12,720 --> 03:45:13,560
Oh, my God.

3335
03:45:14,160 --> 03:45:15,080
I'm in the family.

3336
03:45:15,280 --> 03:45:19,340
I'm talking about our team the fucking most because the
vibes fucking are insane.

3337
03:45:19,460 --> 03:45:21,980
Honestly, yeah, all the fans are like, oh, my God, team
brawl pros.

3338
03:45:22,280 --> 03:45:23,620
I'd love watching the content.

3339
03:45:23,900 --> 03:45:24,980
There are comms and everything.

3340
03:45:26,140 --> 03:45:27,180
Yeah, because we're just gamers.

3341
03:45:27,360 --> 03:45:28,400
Yeah, we're just vibing.

3342
03:45:28,880 --> 03:45:30,520
We're just gamers as well.

3343
03:45:32,160 --> 03:45:35,600
All these other teams are like sweating and analyzing and
trying hard.

3344
03:45:35,820 --> 03:45:36,240
Bro, it's five.

3345
03:45:37,040 --> 03:45:38,300
It's five's over here, bro.

3346
03:45:38,500 --> 03:45:40,380
He's Sam doing his damn, you know what I'm saying?

3347
03:45:40,740 --> 03:45:41,040
Yeah.

3348
03:45:41,600 --> 03:45:43,760
You said he's so hard, but you still lost two rounds.

3349
03:45:43,920 --> 03:45:45,520
So if you two were like, what the fuck is?

3350
03:45:47,140 --> 03:45:47,960
Unironically true.

3351
03:45:48,120 --> 03:45:51,320
I know you're joking, but like, unironically, that's true.

3352
03:45:51,340 --> 03:45:54,200
From a person that has 30 in defense, like, what's wrong?

3353
03:45:54,800 --> 03:45:57,340
I got 58 same z's.

3354
03:45:59,020 --> 03:46:00,740

3356
03:46:01,480 --> 03:46:01,560

I have 54.

3360
03:46:09,160 --> 03:46:10,980
I was like, how do you have 30?

3361
03:46:11,560 --> 03:46:11,960
All offense.

3362
03:46:13,440 --> 03:46:13,600
All offense.

3363
03:46:13,600 --> 03:46:14,340

I showed my chat mod.

3365
03:46:16,360 --> 03:46:19,220
You're like, how did you get the red with 30 defense?

3366
03:46:19,500 --> 03:46:21,120
I'm like, I don't know.

3421
03:50:05,570 --> 03:50:12,630
fucking hyped though oh my god i certainly never been this
nervous before and i'm not even playing some of these games

3422
03:50:14,930 --> 03:50:15,850
actually crazy

3423
03:50:19,340 --> 03:50:23,700
it's actually crazy though guys I can't believe it we made
it to the final

3424
03:50:26,780 --> 03:50:30,260
we made it to the finals guys

3425
03:50:33,980 --> 03:50:41,460
that's insane I did not expect it I felt like I had like the
least experience out of everybody here and then I get to be

3426
03:50:41,460 --> 03:50:45,600
in the finals on this yeah i was the moral support

3427
03:50:49,020 --> 03:50:57,940
yeah i'm happy i like specifically requested brawl pro too
to be my coach so i'm really happy that like i decided to

3428
03:50:57,940 --> 03:51:07,660
play king you know i i don't know i don't even know how we
got into me becoming a king player but like um the fact that

3429
03:51:07,660 --> 03:51:16,200
like uh i i like just randomly decide king will be my my
character to play in this tournament and then because of

3430
03:51:16,200 --> 03:51:23,960
that i specifically requested a brawl pro for uh for like my
coach because i was like oh he's a king player that would

3431
03:51:23,960 --> 03:51:33,120
make sense yeah and then it's destiny it was wait so we have
a hell of a time to chill now yeah yeah they gotta do kfm

3432
03:51:33,120 --> 03:51:37,980
versus vdx then whoever wins that fights tone then they
fight us yeah yeah so we have to wait

3433
03:51:41,200 --> 03:51:49,980
hanging out i'm mad chilling i'm gonna watch that box box
match and see how much i smoked him ego boost myself i'm so

3434
03:51:49,980 --> 03:51:56,120
scared of him though like he's so solid now he got so much
oh my god it's actually crazy yeah and he requested me too

3435
03:51:56,120 --> 03:52:08,760
apparently bra pro like requested for me as well because i
was fucking around on king and and it's just it's just crazy

3436
03:52:08,760 --> 03:52:15,700
i'm very i'm really happy i got this team and like and happy
that because they were there for the first stage i'm slammed

3437
03:52:15,700 --> 03:52:23,520
they got all got together and i was like the plus the what
plus one and i'm just really happy to be able to meet these

3438
03:52:23,520 --> 03:52:31,080
guys it's been such cool vibes i haven't grinding this hard
in the in a game in a long time like last night i was just

3439
03:52:31,080 --> 03:52:36,800
playing rink and i was so toxic to uh because i was just
like i want to

3440
03:52:44,060 --> 03:52:51,600
I think I think the reason why people like even though I'm
in red rank and getting like sort of demolished is also

3441
03:52:51,600 --> 03:53:05,660
because I feel like um I feel like they actually analyze how
I play and then I'm just like I go rank I do allocate I

3442
03:53:05,660 --> 03:53:21,840
think that is like my biggest weakness I don't adapt is
adapting and I'm just like Ali kick good old but then what

3443
03:53:21,840 --> 03:53:28,140
do I do what do I do when they learn the when they learn the
analyze

3444
03:53:31,580 --> 03:53:40,000
what do I do and that's when I get absolutely demolished I'm
actually surprised I still took two rounds off Isam and then

3445
03:53:40,000 --> 03:53:42,180
he adapted and then I don't adapt.

3446
03:53:42,820 --> 03:53:45,720
I just go Ungabungo, but what if it works again?

3447
03:53:50,660 --> 03:53:56,320
I was like, okay, but what if this works again and he
doesn't adapt?

3448
03:53:56,660 --> 03:53:57,960
I was just like, oh, okay.

3449
03:53:59,540 --> 03:54:02,400
Wow, this guy actually knows what he's doing.

3450
03:54:09,230 --> 03:54:14,130
Yeah, I think definitely the 30 defense defense did not help

3451
03:54:17,310 --> 03:54:28,530
the 30 defense was definitely here in my counter there uh
yeah i'm happy that i managed to i feel like i don't know i

3452
03:54:28,530 --> 03:54:34,710
know like because like i feel really happy to be able to
make it to red rank um it was just i think like it says how

3453
03:54:34,710 --> 03:54:40,630
many hours i have in this game how many well to be fair a
lot of it is just buffer where we're waiting but it says

3454
03:54:40,630 --> 03:54:52,350
here how many hours i have right yeah 53 hours in like 53
hours i uh i got like well i want to say like fifth forward

3455
03:54:52,350 --> 03:55:01,710
50 less than 50 50 hours because we've spent a lot on just
waiting so i think like maybe like 50 hours or less to red

3456
03:55:01,710 --> 03:55:18,470
rank i feel like that's really good in general um and like
for my very first uh for my first uh uh 45 yeah maybe 45 i'd

3457
03:55:18,470 --> 03:55:28,570
say 45 hours not counting like all the the waiting and the
practice and the just the practice range and the crashes i

3458
03:55:28,570 --> 03:55:35,290
feel like that's really good for a new player anyway that's
my ego boost today the fact that i got to this rank with

3459
03:55:35,290 --> 03:55:45,150
with like 50 hours i feel like i improved a lot um and like
i basically kept so many actual fight like fighting play

3460
03:55:45,150 --> 03:55:56,270
fighting game players too um because of the bullshit i do
because i know there's like so many people that are like

3461
03:55:56,270 --> 03:56:03,250
actual hardcore grind fighting games and like they're like
hard stuck in like lower eels like that fucking king player

3462
03:56:03,250 --> 03:56:09,210
i bumped into that made it to purple rank and it took him
like one and a half months and i'm like That's sad.

3463
03:56:09,590 --> 03:56:14,890
I'm sorry if you guys I'm not talking about you guys chat Of
course, it's not you guys, but the ones that had like TTV in

3464
03:56:14,890 --> 03:56:20,930
their names and they Have the streaming tag and then I Like
looked at their stream and I just see like Just made it a

3465
03:56:20,930 --> 03:56:27,410
purple rank and I Like looked at a one and a half months ago
They were hard stuck red for one And a half months and I'm

3466
03:56:27,410 --> 03:56:31,350
like that's so Sad I'm literally like two ranks away From
purple

3467
03:56:36,790 --> 03:56:43,530

3469
03:56:56,550 --> 03:56:57,730

I don't know.

3488
03:58:12,190 --> 03:58:18,270
Maybe I'll touch Tekken until I make it to Purple Ring just
to flex a little and then never touch it again.

3489
03:58:24,190 --> 03:58:29,070
Make it to Purple Ring just to be like it's sad that you
guys can't be in this ring.

3490
03:58:32,430 --> 03:58:34,110
No, please continue.

3491
03:58:35,090 --> 03:58:39,470
If Seijam invites me to another Seijam Slam, I'll 100% say
yes.

3492
03:58:40,110 --> 03:58:41,550
Or for any fighting game.

3493
03:58:42,030 --> 03:58:46,410
If Seijam invites me to any fighting game Slam, I'll
participate.

3494
03:58:46,690 --> 03:58:48,870
I'll say yes 100%.

3495
03:58:54,930 --> 03:58:56,930
Peek purple and then start flexing.

3496
03:58:57,090 --> 03:58:57,470
I should.

3497
03:58:57,590 --> 03:59:00,830
I should just peek purple and be like, oh, imagine not being
purple.

3498
03:59:03,750 --> 03:59:05,070
He said my...

3499
03:59:05,090 --> 03:59:11,550
Oh, I never played well like I said never played any
fighting game before so like like like I never played Street

3500
03:59:11,550 --> 03:59:13,690
Fighter before I told well, that's a lie.

3501
03:59:13,730 --> 03:59:20,870
I played like, you know the arcade arcade machines or the
Street Fighter Or the Street Fighter with Marvel characters?

3502
03:59:21,450 --> 03:59:27,010
I would go to I got went to the arcade and I just button
matched for that So like that was my I was like super young

3503
03:59:27,010 --> 03:59:33,630
too, but if Seijam invites me to the Street Fighter The
Street Fighter Say Jam Slam.

3504
03:59:34,110 --> 03:59:34,690
I'll say yes.

3505
03:59:34,830 --> 03:59:37,610
I mean, I'll message him and be like, I'm totally down to
joining in.

3506
03:59:38,090 --> 03:59:39,250
But please put me in newbies.

3507
03:59:40,670 --> 03:59:42,350
And give me actual newbies.

3508
03:59:44,810 --> 03:59:47,090
I want to be the next ESAM.

3509
03:59:50,690 --> 03:59:52,930
Make me the next ESAM.

3510
03:59:53,990 --> 03:59:56,390
I want to know what it feels like.

3511
04:00:02,290 --> 04:00:03,370
Wishful thinking

3512
04:00:08,090 --> 04:00:17,570
No, I'm still a newbie You can't say that I'm not a newbie
anymore I still don't know how to block Wait, that's not

3513
04:00:17,570 --> 04:00:25,550
fair Connor was supposed to Connor was supposed to be in the
say jam slab And he was in the last say jam slab And he was

3514
04:00:25,550 --> 04:00:34,950
categorized as a newbie it's not fair I should be like the
next Connor he was categorized as a newbie even though he

3515
04:00:34,950 --> 04:00:45,810
like couldn't commit it's not fair I should be a newbie
because my blocking stats are still like the newbie tier

3516
04:00:45,810 --> 04:00:57,450
like my attack might be red but my block is definitely like
beginner or first down or some shit my My block is

3517
04:00:57,450 --> 04:00:59,730
definitely in first down.

3518
04:01:03,610 --> 04:01:04,090
True.

3519
04:01:07,030 --> 04:01:10,150
Yeah, so like, I am a newbie.

3520
04:01:11,050 --> 04:01:12,570
I am a newbie, guys.

3521
04:01:12,730 --> 04:01:13,590
It's not fair.

3522
04:01:14,390 --> 04:01:15,570
Look, it's not fair.

3523
04:01:15,970 --> 04:01:17,270
This is my first fighting game.

3524
04:01:17,390 --> 04:01:19,470
I should still be in, like, the last seed.

3525
04:01:19,730 --> 04:01:20,710
Or, what is it, first seed?

3526
04:01:20,770 --> 04:01:21,210
What is it called?

3527
04:01:21,270 --> 04:01:21,890
The last seed?

3528
04:01:27,790 --> 04:01:35,470
um yeah i think i learned really fast i'm really happy that
i learned so fucking fast though who's winning at the moment

3529
04:01:35,470 --> 04:01:43,430
guys you guys know who's winning at the moment oh team fee
team fee oh but then they have like roy who roy is

3530
04:01:43,430 --> 04:01:54,670
apparently really good too um so oh my god it's dragon ball
Wait, Roy is getting his...

3531
04:01:54,670 --> 04:01:55,310
Wait, Roy is...

3532
04:01:55,310 --> 04:01:57,490
Yeah, Roy has to win that because Roy...

3533
04:01:58,390 --> 04:01:59,750
Roy is definitely not...

3534
04:01:59,750 --> 04:02:00,950
Does not belong in this...

3535
04:02:00,950 --> 04:02:01,630
In that seed.

3536
04:02:04,110 --> 04:02:06,950
Roy definitely doesn't belong in the seed.

3537
04:02:07,530 --> 04:02:08,250
It's okay, guys.

3538
04:02:08,330 --> 04:02:10,630
I will represent the VTubers.

3539
04:02:11,410 --> 04:02:11,810
I...

3540
04:02:15,330 --> 04:02:20,510
I will represent the VTubers in the finals.

3541
04:02:24,250 --> 04:02:25,610
it's okay

3542
04:02:30,380 --> 04:02:39,340
wait does no I meant like if they don't win if they don't
get into the finals I will be the vtuber representative

3543
04:02:45,840 --> 04:02:56,000
I said if I didn't say when guys I didn't say when I said if
so I'm giving them them a chance

3544
04:03:01,800 --> 04:03:08,840
I'm so excited also the rare Zaxedon because we haven't had
a chance to actually talk together for a while guys because

3545
04:03:08,840 --> 04:03:16,020
like last week or like this week if you want to say Sunday
is the start of the new week or the end of the week it was

3546
04:03:16,020 --> 04:03:25,360
like my technically it was my chill week where I like
basically play Tekken so it's nice to be able to finally

3547
04:03:25,360 --> 04:03:32,940
like actually talk to you guys and everything um but oh my
god what an eventful week even though like it was

3548
04:03:32,940 --> 04:03:40,220
technically chill week being able to participate in stage m
slam and like uh having stage m invite me to participate i'm

3549
04:03:40,220 --> 04:03:49,160
so happy that he invited me to participate because like i
honestly i i had no expectations i guess about it like i was

3550
04:03:49,160 --> 04:04:00,840
just like oh i'm so bad at fighting games i'm i'm gonna drag
my team down I was so scared then it like like being in the

3551
04:04:00,840 --> 04:04:12,380
team got me super motivated to like get better and improve
and stuff and being able to to just like playing fighting

3552
04:04:12,380 --> 04:04:17,560
games for real for the first time and actually learning
combos was really fun it was really fun I think it wasn't

3553
04:04:17,560 --> 04:04:26,100
with any other team I wouldn't feel as passionate as I did
so I'm just happy I got it Included.

3554
04:04:26,480 --> 04:04:26,600
Oh.

3555
04:04:29,320 --> 04:04:29,800
Yeah.

3556
04:04:30,560 --> 04:04:30,860
Yeah.

3557
04:04:31,060 --> 04:04:35,020
I think if I wasn't so nervous when I was playing against
Gumi, I think I could have won that.

3558
04:04:35,360 --> 04:04:36,460
I was so nervous.

3559
04:04:36,680 --> 04:04:38,840
I was, because like, I, I was thinking.

3560
04:04:39,280 --> 04:04:40,940
I need to remember to stop thinking.

3561
04:04:41,140 --> 04:04:41,540
Yeah.

3562
04:04:41,740 --> 04:04:43,280
Because that's what got me here.

3563
04:04:45,940 --> 04:04:49,160
I need to remember to stop thinking.

3564
04:04:51,340 --> 04:04:53,720
Because I got all the punishes correct.

3565
04:04:53,720 --> 04:04:58,360
I got all the blocks correct, but I did nothing afterwards.

3566
04:05:01,680 --> 04:05:05,020
I forgot how to kill afterwards.

3567
04:05:07,340 --> 04:05:10,880
Yeah, the tournament nerds definitely got me in that game,
but we still clutch.

3568
04:05:11,160 --> 04:05:20,560
Guys, but if I did it, if I won that game, we would not have
got, we wouldn't have got a fucking insane coach game,

3569
04:05:20,660 --> 04:05:20,920
though.

3570
04:05:20,920 --> 04:05:22,520
So I'm happy I lost.

3571
04:05:22,900 --> 04:05:27,280
So we got the sickest coach game ever with the fucking wall
jump.

3572
04:05:27,620 --> 04:05:29,120
That shit was crazy.

3573
04:05:32,100 --> 04:05:33,240
Oh my god.

3574
04:05:33,460 --> 04:05:34,560
The coach plays out.

3575
04:05:34,640 --> 04:05:37,080
We would have missed out, guys.

3576
04:05:37,640 --> 04:05:43,900
We would have 100% missed out on the fucking jump.

3577
04:05:48,120 --> 04:05:50,900
Bro, the fucking wall jump was out.

3578
04:05:50,920 --> 04:05:52,420
actually crazy.

3579
04:05:56,060 --> 04:05:57,520
Oh my god.

3580
04:05:59,300 --> 04:06:00,040
That's fun.

3581
04:06:00,120 --> 04:06:00,840
That's so fun.

3582
04:06:00,960 --> 04:06:01,420
I love...

3583
04:06:01,420 --> 04:06:03,220
I was looking at the...

3584
04:06:03,940 --> 04:06:05,120
I was actually...

3585
04:06:05,120 --> 04:06:06,560
I was looking at the tags.

3586
04:06:07,820 --> 04:06:08,740
That's the tag.

3587
04:06:08,900 --> 04:06:10,140
The birdseater tag.

3588
04:06:10,300 --> 04:06:13,000
And I like posted it in our team chat.

3589
04:06:13,420 --> 04:06:14,920
But I love the...

3590
04:06:15,880 --> 04:06:18,420
Doki versus Esam was closer.

3591
04:06:20,100 --> 04:06:20,780
But...

3592
04:06:20,920 --> 04:06:31,180
wait the jack the jack versus the jack versus asuka that was
fucking brutal

3593
04:06:34,720 --> 04:06:41,380
oh my god oh yeah great time

3594
04:06:46,020 --> 04:06:51,640
oh hey jack sorry that was the freaking massacre.

3595
04:06:53,840 --> 04:06:54,720
I'm happy.

3596
04:06:54,820 --> 04:06:55,860
I'm so happy, though.

3597
04:06:56,000 --> 04:06:58,100
What are your favorite moments chat so far?

3598
04:06:58,460 --> 04:07:01,840
I think like first or second, I really don't care if we get
first or second.

3599
04:07:01,960 --> 04:07:08,000
I think like like no matter what first and second is sort of
like the same prize.

3600
04:07:08,160 --> 04:07:15,420
It's the same prize because we made it to the finals and
like honestly I don't really care if we get first or second

3601
04:07:15,420 --> 04:07:18,840
just because like I had so much fun with my team in the end.

3602
04:07:19,720 --> 04:07:22,340
Um Yeah!

3603
04:07:25,420 --> 04:07:34,600
Bro, it's like the- I swear, like the- The Kony King Mirror
was like the slowest king fight I've ever seen.

3604
04:07:34,760 --> 04:07:41,640
It's so- It's like actually it's like the two kings just
fucking thinking about what to do.

3605
04:07:41,840 --> 04:07:43,440
It's- It's so slow!

3606
04:07:44,360 --> 04:07:45,600
I was like, please!

3607
04:07:45,700 --> 04:07:47,040
I can't take it!

3608
04:07:47,120 --> 04:07:49,360
I can't take such slow king fights!

3609
04:07:51,480 --> 04:08:01,220
it was so intense it's literally rock paper scissors yeah i
would never be that patient if a king made me wait that long

3610
04:08:01,220 --> 04:08:07,900
i i fucking you can have it you deserve it like you deserve
that matchup

3611
04:08:11,780 --> 04:08:20,420
yeah it was a chess match it was honestly all right yeah roy
won their fight i mean it was obvious that Roy was going to

3612
04:08:20,420 --> 04:08:21,240
win that fight.

3613
04:08:21,580 --> 04:08:22,360
Not going to lie.

3614
04:08:22,680 --> 04:08:29,140
It was so like, Roy is really good at... Was that character,
the main character buff?

3615
04:08:29,860 --> 04:08:31,880
He literally has the main character buff.

3616
04:08:33,000 --> 04:08:34,480
But FD wins this.

3617
04:08:35,640 --> 04:08:37,100
Oh wait, FD might win this.

3618
04:08:37,180 --> 04:08:38,020
So it's Team FD.

3619
04:08:41,140 --> 04:08:43,040
Gin buff is real.

3620
04:08:43,320 --> 04:08:46,180
Yeah, but how well are you going to do against Tone's team?

3621
04:08:46,280 --> 04:08:51,920
I feel like Tone's team is definitely like... I think it was
like has to be the major upset because Tone's team is

3622
04:08:51,920 --> 04:08:53,880
actually, it is so fucking good.

3623
04:08:54,380 --> 04:09:00,060
I feel like Tone's team has, like Tone's team was supposed
to be in the flatness because none of us, all of us was

3624
04:09:00,060 --> 04:09:05,100
like, oh yeah, we're definitely going to go to the loser
brackets after winning, winning that.

3625
04:09:05,600 --> 04:09:08,100
We were like, oh yeah, definitely, we're not going to win
against Tone.

3626
04:09:08,260 --> 04:09:13,360
So the fact that we did was definitely has to be a huge
upset for Tone.

3627
04:09:15,360 --> 04:09:17,220
Uh, yeah.

3628
04:09:17,440 --> 04:09:18,980
I was so surprised.

3629
04:09:22,040 --> 04:09:30,980
yeah their team is really fucking good so i feel like like
fee versus tone i don't know unless they didn't study fee's

3630
04:09:30,980 --> 04:09:41,260
team and just heavily studied our team i feel like tone's
team would win uh yeah it had it had to be a major upset

3631
04:09:41,260 --> 04:09:49,400
like even our team was like oh yeah we're not gonna we're
not gonna we're gonna be in the loser brackets though They

3632
04:09:49,400 --> 04:09:50,480
were the favorites.

3633
04:09:52,560 --> 04:09:53,820
No, 100%.

3634
04:09:53,820 --> 04:09:58,120
I feel that we're going to play against ESAM again.

3635
04:09:58,960 --> 04:10:00,000
And ESAM will...

3636
04:10:00,000 --> 04:10:01,640
ESAM will adapt.

3637
04:10:02,540 --> 04:10:04,540

Nothing yet.

3691
04:16:41,030 --> 04:16:43,970
He said, I thought he said that Eva wants to send everyone
no matter what.

3692
04:16:45,010 --> 04:16:45,610
Is that what he said?

3693
04:16:46,070 --> 04:16:47,370
Oh my god, it's me!

3694
04:16:47,970 --> 04:16:48,690
With those shoes?

3695
04:16:49,110 --> 04:16:50,910
I was trying to see what Tony was saying about me.

3696
04:16:51,130 --> 04:16:51,590
What the fuck?

3697
04:16:51,790 --> 04:16:52,710
What's wrong with you?

3698
04:16:53,210 --> 04:16:54,130
What's wrong with you?

3699
04:16:54,190 --> 04:16:55,710
You're bad from the Doki Council.

3700
04:16:56,610 --> 04:16:57,490
So talented.

3701
04:16:57,810 --> 04:16:59,530
You're bad from the Doki Council.

3702
04:17:00,450 --> 04:17:01,890
Doki's need to wear shoes.

3703
04:17:05,110 --> 04:17:09,370
The Doki Prime declares that all Doki's need to wear shoes.

3704
04:17:09,670 --> 04:17:11,150
What's wrong with you?

3705
04:17:11,270 --> 04:17:16,070
Matt, I think he said he might send the third place or
something?

3706
04:17:16,070 --> 04:17:16,730
What the fuck?

3707
04:17:17,410 --> 04:17:18,590
I said send us next year.

3708
04:17:18,790 --> 04:17:20,210
But I mean, I'm just kidding.

3709
04:17:20,730 --> 04:17:21,410
We're free?

3710
04:17:21,970 --> 04:17:22,390
Exactly!

3711
04:17:23,210 --> 04:17:26,930
How dare you give this for free and not monetize it?

3712
04:17:27,590 --> 04:17:29,070
What's wrong with you, Doki?

3713
04:17:31,210 --> 04:17:31,970
This is it.

3714
04:17:32,030 --> 04:17:33,370
You get the alley kick special.

04:18:35,030 --> 04:18:36,930
And then PDX was like, he's for real.

04:22:00,910 --> 04:22:02,750
Guys, you can tell I fixed my PC.

3758
04:22:04,250 --> 04:22:06,010
So nobody can complain anymore.

3759
04:22:06,650 --> 04:22:08,970
I had to underclock my PC hard.

3760
04:22:15,750 --> 04:22:17,170
I fixed it, though.

3761
04:22:23,800 --> 04:22:35,440
the solution that's not fixing it is nobody noticed people
were like oh my god she's on her new PC and I was like yeah

3762
04:22:36,260 --> 04:22:40,280
but now I had to confess because like I can't lie

3763
04:22:43,400 --> 04:22:51,900
I had to confess to you guys because I would never lie to
you guys about it you know oh my god what the fuck

3764
04:22:55,080 --> 04:22:57,440
You guys did not know shit.

Don't lie.

3766
04:22:59,460 --> 04:23:03,040
You guys did not know that I was using my old PC.

3767
04:23:03,180 --> 04:23:04,240
Because it looked good.

3768
04:23:07,100 --> 04:23:08,880
It looked so good.

3769
04:23:09,460 --> 04:23:13,080
Okay, somebody has to fucking stop.

3770
04:23:15,320 --> 04:23:15,560
Nope.

3771
04:23:16,000 --> 04:23:17,980
This is why your environment's dying.

3772
04:23:19,980 --> 04:23:20,620
Bro.

3773
04:23:21,720 --> 04:23:22,500

3775
04:23:24,840 --> 04:23:26,340
We're hunting you down.

3776
04:23:27,220 --> 04:23:28,420
You'll have nowhere to live.

3777
04:23:30,080 --> 04:23:31,140
What is he doing?

3778
04:23:35,980 --> 04:23:37,220

3781
04:23:48,980 --> 04:23:50,400
Oh, I shouldn't say that.

3782
04:23:52,780 --> 04:23:56,620
He's a good teammate because I also lost every game today.

3783
04:24:03,910 --> 04:24:05,530

04:24:39,350 --> 04:24:40,370
I'm so sorry.

3788
04:24:42,650 --> 04:24:45,550
Whenever I'm at a...

3789
04:24:45,550 --> 04:24:48,570
When I play Tekken, it's hard to stop.

3790
04:24:49,470 --> 04:24:51,070
Like, there's nobody safe.

3791
04:24:51,710 --> 04:24:53,090
Nobody's safe from me.

3792
04:24:54,450 --> 04:24:55,030
That's why.

3793
04:24:57,570 --> 04:24:58,290
Nice.

3794
04:24:58,650 --> 04:24:58,950
Okay.

3795
04:25:00,850 --> 04:25:02,710
Just nobody is safe.

3796
04:25:03,190 --> 04:25:04,130
Everybody gets hurt.

3797
04:25:09,690 --> 04:25:11,490
Losing to a first done?

3798
04:25:11,810 --> 04:25:14,470
You know that guy was not actually a first done.

3799
04:25:14,610 --> 04:25:16,070
This guy fucking played before.

3800
04:25:16,510 --> 04:25:18,370
This is not their first fighting game.

3801
04:25:21,390 --> 04:25:23,830
This guy was not their first one.

3802
04:25:26,730 --> 04:25:28,970
Learn a combo first before.

3803
04:25:29,190 --> 04:25:31,310
I don't need to learn a combo.

3804
04:25:33,790 --> 04:25:35,530
I could get it away with you.

3805
04:25:35,550 --> 04:25:44,490
it until i can't okay if i don't know combos it's because my
coach didn't coach me hard enough all right

3820
04:27:48,030 --> 04:27:49,910
I stopped learning.

3821
04:27:50,530 --> 04:27:54,350
There's like a point where I just suddenly stopped learning
because it's like too much.

3822
04:27:54,450 --> 04:27:58,410
You know, like pay a subscription to start learning more,
guys?

3823
04:27:58,730 --> 04:28:00,130
I used up all my data.

3824
04:28:00,830 --> 04:28:02,890
I used up my subscription data.

3825
04:28:05,590 --> 04:28:08,310
I used up my subscription data.

3826
04:28:08,770 --> 04:28:12,490
It was like 5 gigabytes and all that 5 gigabytes was gone.

3827
04:28:13,690 --> 04:28:15,070
Let me back in.

3828
04:28:15,630 --> 04:28:27,230
back in the free sample has ended your monthly your free
monthly subscription has ended okay this is the last one

3829
04:28:27,230 --> 04:28:37,550
it's very possible that we play team PDX I mean SK and Isam
are tied they're tied oh shit oh my god they're tied SK is

3830
04:28:37,550 --> 04:28:45,310

blocking it then she's doing while standing for she's

3831
04:28:46,850 --> 04:28:47,450
Blocking?

3832
04:28:47,770 --> 04:28:49,130
For real.

3833
04:28:52,050 --> 04:28:54,290
Poppro, why didn't you teach me that?

3834
04:28:54,890 --> 04:28:59,350
I literally tried for like two days straight.

3835
04:29:01,330 --> 04:29:04,130
This is why my defense is at 30.

3836
04:29:08,850 --> 04:29:10,050
Oh my.

3837
04:29:10,670 --> 04:29:11,610
It's a fear.

3838
04:29:11,690 --> 04:29:13,390
How is she blocking?

3839
04:29:13,410 --> 04:29:15,610
Just so we can say we beat all the other teams.

3840
04:29:15,630 --> 04:29:38,770
maybe I don't know I would love to not play Josh again I'll
say that much I mean you'd have to fight by freaking

3846
04:30:16,550 --> 04:30:17,810
I need you to know that, okay?

3847
04:30:17,910 --> 04:30:19,110
It's not anything else.

3848
04:30:19,230 --> 04:30:20,270
I was not paying attention.

3849
04:30:26,030 --> 04:30:26,950

You're a good example of how I farm all of you.

We, I think we three-tued a different day.

3911
04:34:26,920 --> 04:34:27,660
Like we three-tued.

3912
04:34:27,680 --> 04:34:33,140
than them for one but yeah i see i think mix

3913
04:34:36,810 --> 04:34:46,070
nice no way she went for that giant maiden at work that's
sick she got a round off uh we went three two day one

3914
04:34:46,070 --> 04:34:52,650
against them then four one yeah yeah i'm way more confident
against them i mean we can't beat tony obviously but

3915
04:34:56,400 --> 04:35:04,680
tony's team is just tiny is just stressful i feel like it
went two sets so i think it's because their team all like

3916
04:35:04,680 --> 04:35:13,620
analyzed us but they didn't really analyze each other sure I
feel like possible because I know a lot of them were

3917
04:35:13,620 --> 04:35:15,280
hard-grinding against our

3918
04:35:21,240 --> 04:35:31,080
characters wait why is he deep hacking her oh yeah that's so
toxic I didn't see it I saw it man maybe Riz just annoyed

3919
04:35:31,080 --> 04:35:39,240
that you beat him it's taking out his anger somewhere else
that's true he's like I was very disrespectful in my shit.

3920
04:35:39,320 --> 04:35:39,980
I feel bad.

3921
04:35:40,960 --> 04:35:43,580
I was so annoyed after we watched those tapes last night,
dude.

3922
04:35:43,980 --> 04:35:45,940
Like, I was like, dude, he's doing one thing.

3923
04:35:46,940 --> 04:35:47,400
Yeah.

3924
04:35:47,780 --> 04:35:50,480
You lost to the Hayachi gatekeeper.

3925
04:35:50,800 --> 04:35:52,000
Hayachi gatekeeper?

3926
04:35:52,820 --> 04:35:55,160
I'm about to fight Hayachi and Dragonel walks in for it.

3927
04:35:55,240 --> 04:35:55,460
Wait.

3928
04:35:57,460 --> 04:35:58,400
He's a bot.

3929
04:35:58,680 --> 04:36:01,100
Dude, that's mad disrespectful to say about him.

3930
04:36:01,100 --> 04:36:01,620
I know.

3931
04:36:01,740 --> 04:36:04,060
I know, but I was so fucking mad, dude.

3932
04:36:04,300 --> 04:36:04,560
Oh.

3933
04:36:07,060 --> 04:36:07,880
Oh, man.

3934
04:36:10,360 --> 04:36:10,820
Oh, my God.

3935
04:36:11,080 --> 04:36:11,960
She's kind of...

3936
04:36:11,960 --> 04:36:13,180
She's going crazy.

3937
04:36:13,780 --> 04:36:14,160
She's kind of...

3938
04:36:14,580 --> 04:36:16,000
Are we sure we want to bend this team?

3939
04:36:16,380 --> 04:36:16,680
We blocked this.

3940
04:36:16,720 --> 04:36:17,260
We blocked this.

3941
04:36:26,340 --> 04:36:29,400
I'm way more confident against Kat than Reed.

3942
04:36:29,620 --> 04:36:33,160
It's because Kat kind of gets scrambled against pressure.

3943
04:36:33,600 --> 04:36:36,340
Yeah, she gets really flustered against a lot of offense.

3944
04:36:37,440 --> 04:36:38,520
Remember the last thing he thought?

3945
04:36:38,520 --> 04:36:39,220
Oh, good break.

3946
04:36:39,460 --> 04:36:39,840
Fucked on her.

3947
04:36:40,020 --> 04:36:41,340
Not going to lie.

3948
04:36:41,380 --> 04:36:41,680
Wait.

3949
04:36:41,780 --> 04:36:42,300
Oh, my God.

3950
04:36:42,460 --> 04:36:43,460
Oh, no, wait.

3951
04:36:43,500 --> 04:36:43,740
No.

3952
04:36:44,000 --> 04:36:45,700
What if I tackle you back?

3953
04:36:46,400 --> 04:36:47,200
That's crazy.

3954
04:36:49,620 --> 04:36:50,120
Oh,

3955
04:37:01,410 --> 04:37:02,590
Bro's got his bowl out.

3956
04:37:03,110 --> 04:37:05,410
That's a really nice wig.

3957
04:37:08,530 --> 04:37:10,270
He can't even tell, bro.

3958
04:37:11,390 --> 04:37:13,130
Goes into the sideburns too.

3959
04:37:13,270 --> 04:37:13,890
That looks nice.

3960
04:37:14,410 --> 04:37:16,690
The technology is kind of crazy.

3961
04:37:17,930 --> 04:37:19,110
It's all that Chipotle money.

3962
04:37:19,250 --> 04:37:20,110
It's all that Chipotle money.

3963
04:37:20,690 --> 04:37:32,830
He's got it out because he knows he's saving money now that
horse hair what is that horse hair that looks good slime

3964
04:37:35,540 --> 04:37:45,220
truth i've had slime truth pinned all his dreams at the top
that's the best i've ever seen in my life dude you had to

3965
04:37:45,220 --> 04:37:54,300
watch it when he made that in real time that was the funny
dude the photoshop like ai i asked it to make him bald and

3966
04:37:54,300 --> 04:37:58,180
it delivered me so good I mean, maybe AI isn't so bad, bro.

3967
04:37:58,500 --> 04:38:00,200
I literally was like, you know what?

3968
04:38:00,680 --> 04:38:02,000
This is a good application of this.

3969
04:38:02,000 --> 04:38:03,180
We worked with the machines.

3970
04:38:03,600 --> 04:38:04,500
Dude, slime.

3971
04:38:04,620 --> 04:38:05,300
It's a utopia.

3972
04:38:06,280 --> 04:38:08,560
At first, you were like, you were like, make him bald.

3973
04:38:08,760 --> 04:38:11,440
And then they turned him into a stock image, shrugging.

3974
04:38:11,580 --> 04:38:12,700
And he was still crazy.

3975
04:38:13,160 --> 04:38:14,160
Yeah, it's funny.

3976
04:38:14,380 --> 04:38:17,900
And then to fix it, you said, make his head bald.

3977
04:38:18,360 --> 04:38:19,500
Oh, and it fixed it.

3978
04:38:19,620 --> 04:38:21,460
I'm like, what the fuck is this?

3979
04:38:22,000 --> 04:38:23,300
It's an imperfect technology.

3980
04:38:23,660 --> 04:38:33,440
If it comes to it specifically, making sayjam bald i support
it only for that make his head bald it's so redundant but it

3981
04:38:33,440 --> 04:38:42,760
works yeah come on cat if cat wins this they only need one
more set yeah yeah he's gonna send it oh no way she could

3982
04:38:42,760 --> 04:38:54,720
have just oh he's dead that's it dude oh no way no way she
chokes oh no way no way she could have won that she's

3983
04:38:54,720 --> 04:39:02,520
probably i mean super stressed you know what i mean yeah i
mean like they're the underdogs you know so tone's team

3984
04:39:02,520 --> 04:39:08,620
might be on tilt from from what happened with our arms on
tail the tones on tilt 100 i was definitely on tail with the

3985
04:39:08,620 --> 04:39:16,700
way he was trying to like you could see it to lose yeah i
think the team is on till after what what we demolished them

3986
04:39:16,700 --> 04:39:29,120
demolished last yeah yeah that's three to two demolish
that's a lot i'll call it out is rage art yeah that was the

3987
04:39:29,120 --> 04:39:36,380
most obvious rage he just pops it raiders just lets it go
hey if it worked it worked right that gives the set i mean i

3988
04:39:36,380 --> 04:39:41,440
let her rock too yeah yeah no i'm not saying there's
anything wrong with it it's like it's great especially with

3989
04:39:41,440 --> 04:39:49,720
how much pressure cat like just keeps running up but it's a
good spot yeah the the harder you go and second the more

3990
04:39:49,720 --> 04:39:57,040
it'll be like plus frames dashed up wait you know because
you're afraid of the rage art yeah you know then the mind

3991
04:39:57,040 --> 04:40:10,480
games start and it gets fucking scary yeah please fee please
dude that Chipotle unironically looks good did you guys

3992
04:40:10,480 --> 04:40:18,400
already use your free code dude I used my code for lunch
today and I just saw a text message from my wife she was

3993
04:40:18,400 --> 04:40:24,860
like hey I got you a Chipotle burrito it's on the stove we
didn't even talk like she just got it so now I got another

3994
04:40:24,860 --> 04:40:37,320
one ready what the fuck that's lunch tomorrow you need to
fully sponsored your wife no oh I love this stage shit nice

3995
04:40:37,320 --> 04:40:45,960
the last round lol dude the moment he didn't fucking take
muscle buster I was like oh it's over did you hear yeah dude

3996
04:40:45,960 --> 04:40:54,120
no it was an offense yeah it's relentless there's gaps
though everything he's doing except for that move everything

3997
04:40:54,120 --> 04:41:02,440
else he's doing there's a gap jeez dick jab is your fan
against ravers like that he's doing four four yeah you can

3998
04:41:02,440 --> 04:41:09,540
back three him in between or you can jab to float him what's
four you can duck that point it out when you see it i don't

3999
04:41:09,540 --> 04:41:18,480
know what it is okay sure he did it on you a few times if i
can yeah see his one-to-one worked after because the third

4000
04:41:18,480 --> 04:41:22,160
hit is uh that's a high it's plus if you block it she's
fumbling

4001
04:41:25,880 --> 04:41:26,580
That's good.

4002
04:41:27,180 --> 04:41:31,640
Yeah, so the thing about Ray is, you see, he does like that
double hammer down, right?

4003
04:41:31,640 --> 04:41:33,420
And it's he plus and he kind of fucks on you.

4004
04:41:33,740 --> 04:41:39,160
Like he always does something that is not still real
afterwards.

4005
04:41:39,320 --> 04:41:41,100
Like he'll take an extra, extra long move.

4006
04:41:41,380 --> 04:41:44,360
So just dick jab after you see that, honestly, and you
fucking, you beat him.

4007
04:41:44,640 --> 04:41:46,060
Because he takes too many turns.

4008
04:41:46,540 --> 04:41:47,600
He's like, oh, I'm hella plus.

4009
04:41:47,720 --> 04:41:49,560
Let me do an even more slower move.

4010
04:41:49,840 --> 04:41:51,360
But it's not airtight, you know?

4011
04:41:51,660 --> 04:41:55,080
That's my issue is I don't know how to take my turn back
consistently against him.

4012
04:41:55,560 --> 04:42:03,320
it's like if i can't land the power push he's just oh my god
mix oh my god mix he's just down two dude we gotta block

4013
04:42:03,320 --> 04:42:08,480
that we can't let him win with that stupid move it's
literally all he's doing that's the most fraudulent drag

4014
04:42:08,480 --> 04:42:14,660
i've ever seen oh my god that was tight though but she's
crazy because that's what we talked about is like anytime i

4015
04:42:14,660 --> 04:42:24,480
get hit while standing for and then i just forget like when
i'm in game i'm like uh yeah minus on hit yeah i mean if he

4016
04:42:24,480 --> 04:42:29,820
again if he notices you're doing the while setting four
after he can counter plate but is rated to doing that you

4017
04:42:29,820 --> 04:42:36,580
know no not not at this he's not gonna he's not gonna he's
not in grand finals like he's been getting away with it so

4018
04:42:36,580 --> 04:42:45,280
long you know yeah just match four if you just see the move
at all you know block or hit block you get a punish hit you

4019
04:42:45,280 --> 04:42:53,880
probably get a punish who does josh have to play did he beat
this guy last time uh josh uh fairlight thanks yeah fair

4020
04:42:54,060 --> 04:42:54,800
Fairlight's strong.

4021
04:42:55,120 --> 04:42:56,380
This is in favor of Fee, I think.

4022
04:42:57,400 --> 04:42:58,560
I don't have the things.

4023
04:42:58,960 --> 04:43:01,840
So it'd be Fee, Tony, which... Which is a...

4024
04:43:01,840 --> 04:43:03,760
They played earlier, and then...

4025
04:43:03,760 --> 04:43:05,640
Oh, and then Tony had sent him to losers.

4026
04:43:06,040 --> 04:43:06,300
Yeah.

4027
04:43:06,620 --> 04:43:07,040
At the tournament.

4028
04:43:07,540 --> 04:43:09,820
Wait, how did we 4-1 this team?

4029
04:43:09,820 --> 04:43:10,700
Oh, but Boxbox, though.

4030
04:43:12,400 --> 04:43:14,600
Slime... Slime beat Fairlight?

4031
04:43:15,320 --> 04:43:15,580
No.

4032
04:43:15,940 --> 04:43:16,380
No.

4033
04:43:16,500 --> 04:43:17,660
No, that fang is nasty.

4034
04:43:18,660 --> 04:43:19,920
Wait, then we did it 4-1.

4035
04:43:19,920 --> 04:43:20,620
I beat Kat.

4036
04:43:21,000 --> 04:43:22,040
She beat...

4037
04:43:22,040 --> 04:43:23,200
I didn't beat S.

4038
04:43:23,200 --> 04:43:23,980
She beat S-Gay.

4039
04:43:24,060 --> 04:43:25,020
No, I didn't BSK.

4040
04:43:25,720 --> 04:43:26,200
Oh, you didn't?

4041
04:43:26,520 --> 04:43:26,960
No, no.

4042
04:43:27,080 --> 04:43:28,080
I only bait Logan.

4043
04:43:28,300 --> 04:43:29,320
I'm just straight up lies.

4044
04:43:29,440 --> 04:43:30,140
Logan and Amour.

4045
04:43:30,160 --> 04:43:30,960
Maybe we just three-twoed them.

4046
04:43:31,860 --> 04:43:32,100
Okay.

4047
04:43:32,480 --> 04:43:33,540
Because I know you beat Fee.

4048
04:43:33,700 --> 04:43:34,380
He beat FD.

4049
04:43:34,480 --> 04:43:35,160
And I beat Cat Link.

4050
04:43:35,480 --> 04:43:35,840
Oh, okay.

4051
04:43:35,940 --> 04:43:37,020
So we just three-three-two.

4052
04:43:37,400 --> 04:43:38,260
Might be three-two's.

4053
04:43:38,360 --> 04:43:39,500
Slime can beat Fairlight.

4054
04:43:39,600 --> 04:43:40,580
Is this Slime paying attention?

4055
04:43:41,060 --> 04:43:42,660
Slime, are you even paying attention, Slime?

4056
04:43:42,780 --> 04:43:44,060
His ass better be watching, true.

4057
04:43:44,520 --> 04:43:45,620
He's watching more melee.

4058
04:43:45,860 --> 04:43:46,520
I respect it.

4059
04:43:46,820 --> 04:43:47,900
Is he actually...

4060
04:43:47,900 --> 04:43:48,620
Okay, I'm like...

4061
04:43:48,620 --> 04:43:49,600

not look like brian this skin is disarming like that's a

4092
04:47:00,440 --> 04:47:06,160
normal guy you know about magic the gathering commercial in
like the 90s where they're like what's this about and

they're like cool rad dudes uh i'll link it he looks like
that he looks like one of that those guys i mean i could

4094
04:47:12,720 --> 04:47:20,500
such a specific reference he looks like a guy from a mentos
commercial is that you're gonna instantly get it i i feel

4095
04:47:20,500 --> 04:47:27,720
like i can already imagine the commercial based on what
saying what oh my god these guys are gaming they're just

4096
04:47:27,720 --> 04:47:36,320
punching each other oh my god he looks like the guy from
streets of rage oh axel kind of that's just a white shirt

4097
04:47:36,320 --> 04:47:44,600
who's he supposed to be isn't he supposed to be someone is
he leon leon but like leon the weird streetwear leon 90s

4098
04:47:44,600 --> 04:47:54,060
leon what the is this commercial it's like a uh it's like an
mtv spot actually for magic the gathering dude i'm gonna

have experience knowing that that's safe if charges like

4120
04:50:50,420 --> 04:51:00,940

like evo's on the line here so like this guy this is what we

4122
04:51:08,100 --> 04:51:17,560
were experiencing right yeah this is this is now right yeah
i feel like pro mk match yeah i i feel like total team

4123
04:51:17,560 --> 04:51:27,120
didn't at all box box doki i don't think you're wrong man i
i think seriously people like trained for us because that

4124
04:51:27,120 --> 04:51:34,240
happened last time too so yeah because i did not expect
tone's team to not do that well against v's team yeah

4125
04:51:34,240 --> 04:51:47,820
because they knew all our share i was like what the yeah
nice dude and box box really wanted the win yeah don't don't

4126
04:51:47,820 --> 04:51:52,700
don't play one more set one more set for the boys and they
spin that shit

4127
04:51:57,360 --> 04:52:10,400
damn so maybe they just focused on us yeah yeah do we know
how to fight against fees team like we won three two which

4128
04:52:10,400 --> 04:52:19,320
means it was a coach match all right bro bro you ready
that's assuming i beat fd and last time that was shit was

4129
04:52:19,560 --> 04:52:20,580
Literally one hit.

4130
04:52:22,620 --> 04:52:23,280
We'll see.

4131
04:52:25,120 --> 04:52:26,660
But I know the matchup better now.

4132
04:52:26,980 --> 04:52:31,660
And so, in the end, the fans will remember us as first place
winners.

4133
04:52:33,180 --> 04:52:34,860
We will rewrite history again.

05:21:11,200 --> 05:21:11,360
Oh my god.

4548
05:21:11,560 --> 05:21:12,060
That's right.

4549
05:21:12,240 --> 05:21:13,020
And you hit him with a break.

4550
05:21:13,280 --> 05:21:13,720
Give me the point.

4551
05:21:14,060 --> 05:21:15,560
Give me your points.

4552
05:21:16,100 --> 05:21:16,540
Yes.

4553
05:21:17,340 --> 05:21:18,700
Sweet the team.

4554
05:21:19,340 --> 05:21:20,240
She's scared now.

4555
05:21:20,460 --> 05:21:21,240
Now we run up grab.

4556
05:21:23,400 --> 05:21:24,800
Oh my god.

4557
05:21:24,800 --> 05:21:25,460
She's so scared.

4558
05:21:25,520 --> 05:21:26,980
You're predicting you're alive.

4559
05:21:28,320 --> 05:21:28,420
Oh my goodness.

4560
05:21:29,660 --> 05:21:30,040
No!

4561
05:21:30,620 --> 05:21:31,520
Counter hit everywhere.

4562
05:21:32,520 --> 05:21:34,080
Never let her get up!

4563
05:21:34,600 --> 05:21:35,760
Nice punish, Cody.

4564
05:21:35,940 --> 05:21:36,520
That's a punish.

4565
05:21:36,740 --> 05:21:37,320
The one, two?

4566
05:21:37,760 --> 05:21:38,520
That was a punish.

4567
05:21:38,620 --> 05:21:39,280
Now we fight.

4568
05:21:39,600 --> 05:21:40,640
Yeah, now we fight every time.

4569
05:21:40,860 --> 05:21:41,320
I get it.

4570
05:21:41,360 --> 05:21:42,320
I know how this game works.

4571
05:21:42,720 --> 05:21:43,300
Now we go.

4572
05:21:44,300 --> 05:21:44,780
Now we go.

4573
05:21:46,740 --> 05:21:47,700
Who is he?

4574
05:21:49,480 --> 05:21:50,560
He's starting to believe.

4575
05:21:50,740 --> 05:21:52,040
He moves like they do.

4576
05:21:53,080 --> 05:21:54,340
He's in her mind.

4577
05:21:54,640 --> 05:21:54,780
Good shit.

4578
05:21:54,960 --> 05:21:55,780
I hate this stage.

4579
05:21:57,160 --> 05:21:58,860

Just grab and stagger on.

05:22:39,820 --> 05:22:40,420
I caught it.

4589
05:22:40,880 --> 05:22:41,960

Oh.

4593
05:22:44,940 --> 05:22:45,140
What else?

4594
05:22:45,640 --> 05:22:51,040
You still have smash though.

4595
05:22:51,700 --> 05:22:51,860
Yeah.

4596
05:22:52,140 --> 05:22:52,600
That's a win con.

4597
05:22:52,740 --> 05:22:52,920
That's a win con.

4598
05:22:53,340 --> 05:22:54,100
And she's burning rage.

4599
05:22:54,340 --> 05:22:55,220
You don't have to worry about it.

4600
05:22:55,520 --> 05:22:55,700
Yeah.

4601
05:22:56,520 --> 05:22:58,020
She had a lot of gray life though.

4602
05:22:58,040 --> 05:22:58,960
So it's going to take that.

4603
05:22:59,100 --> 05:23:00,840
But other than that, you don't have to worry about it.

4604
05:23:01,020 --> 05:23:01,360
Okay.

4605
05:23:01,500 --> 05:23:01,680
Okay.

4606
05:23:06,260 --> 05:23:07,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4607
05:23:07,440 --> 05:23:07,720
There you go.

4608
05:23:07,780 --> 05:23:08,320
One more mix.

4609
05:23:08,520 --> 05:23:09,260
She was in the air.

4610
05:23:13,220 --> 05:23:15,240
Oh, what a block by her.

4611
05:23:16,340 --> 05:23:17,000
Oh, my God.

4612
05:23:18,100 --> 05:23:19,300
Oh, I go to alley kick.

4613
05:23:19,800 --> 05:23:20,800
I went to alley kick.

4614
05:23:21,000 --> 05:23:21,880
I did down back three.

4615
05:23:22,400 --> 05:23:23,000
Oh, nice try.

4616
05:23:23,120 --> 05:23:23,520
Nice try.

05:23:23,640 --> 05:23:23,860
Nice try.

4618
05:23:24,040 --> 05:23:24,320
Nice try.

4619
05:23:24,540 --> 05:23:25,600
I got to get off that stage.

4620
05:23:25,920 --> 05:23:26,640
I'm getting off there.

4621
05:23:27,580 --> 05:23:27,740
Very close.

4622
05:23:27,740 --> 05:23:28,460
Very close.

4623
05:23:28,820 --> 05:23:29,640
Oh, it was a close.

4624
05:23:29,840 --> 05:23:29,920
It was close.

4625
05:23:30,160 --> 05:23:30,300
It was close.

4626
05:23:31,140 --> 05:23:32,360
She's playing a lot, bro.

4627
05:23:32,480 --> 05:23:33,100
She got better.

4628
05:23:34,000 --> 05:23:34,940
Yeah, 100%.

4629
05:23:34,940 --> 05:23:36,280
Yeah, she's playing County King.

4630
05:23:36,360 --> 05:23:37,740
I just got to grab more.

4631
05:23:38,060 --> 05:23:38,760
I know the timing.

4632
05:23:39,840 --> 05:23:39,840
Yeah.

4633
05:23:40,160 --> 05:23:41,020
She doesn't tech.

4634
05:23:41,800 --> 05:23:42,940
She's barely been ducking either.

4635
05:23:43,260 --> 05:23:43,720
No, yeah.

4636
05:23:44,340 --> 05:23:45,140
All right, I got it.

4637
05:23:45,400 --> 05:23:45,720
I got it.

4638
05:23:45,860 --> 05:23:45,860
I got it.

4639
05:23:45,860 --> 05:23:50,140
You just wanted to be a pretty king for a third round.

4640
05:23:50,940 --> 05:23:53,040
I got a good, uh, I got a good stage here.

4641
05:23:53,100 --> 05:23:54,500
Get ready for the next battle.

4642
05:23:54,940 --> 05:23:56,020
Oh, nice.

4643
05:23:56,940 --> 05:23:57,260
Okay.

4644
05:23:58,080 --> 05:23:58,880
Come on, baby.

4645
05:23:59,020 --> 05:24:00,300
Is she scared at the start again?

4646
05:24:01,220 --> 05:24:01,960
That would be hilarious.

4647
05:24:01,960 --> 05:24:03,420
I could have just done the fucking pedigree again.

4648
05:24:03,980 --> 05:24:04,420
Okay.

4649
05:24:09,300 --> 05:24:10,200
Drop his wallet.

05:24:10,480 --> 05:24:10,820
That's okay.

4651
05:24:11,560 --> 05:24:12,900
Oh, fuck, man.

05:24:17,680 --> 05:24:19,340
Dude, that just locks me in.

King sweep!

4694
05:26:06,840 --> 05:26:08,100
She wasn't playing really good.

4695
05:26:08,240 --> 05:26:10,920
Her composure has gotten so much better, dude.

4696
05:26:11,160 --> 05:26:15,860
I like, I kind of steamrolled her at certain points, but
like, there are other times that she took the game back from

4697
05:26:15,860 --> 05:26:16,400
me.

4698
05:26:17,420 --> 05:26:20,180
Okay, hey, bro, you're at PDX because I'm going to lose the
FT.

05:26:23,620 --> 05:26:24,300

I think I know what I have to do.

4711
05:26:45,440 --> 05:26:46,940
Like, taunts while rage-guarding.

Bro, slime, I'm going to tell you the truth, dude.

I think he knows he has to win.

He's food.

He's insane.

He's food.

4724
05:28:26,390 --> 05:28:29,730
He's going to be missing in the forest lady.

4725
05:28:31,650 --> 05:28:32,510
He's so scared.

4726
05:28:32,750 --> 05:28:33,750
He doesn't want to lose it.

4727
05:28:35,810 --> 05:28:38,390
Yeah, he wants to put the pressure on the other guy.

4728
05:28:38,630 --> 05:28:39,050

4740
05:29:01,250 --> 05:29:02,010
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4741
05:29:03,870 --> 05:29:04,790
Damn, that's a lot, though.

4742

That one is a lot.

4743
05:29:10,670 --> 05:29:12,790

05:29:33,400 --> 05:29:34,860
What the fuck is that?

4750
05:29:35,280 --> 05:29:36,140
I can't believe he didn't turn it.

4751
05:29:36,260 --> 05:29:48,980
That's actually crazy He's desperate as fuck He's so
desperate slime Give us that live coaching bra bro He's

4752
05:29:48,980 --> 05:29:51,060
gonna shoulder you every time you do back one, you have to
stop.

4753
05:29:54,380 --> 05:29:59,320
Unless you think he's gonna hit, unless you think he's gonna
pressure you, then you have to do it, but he has the punish.

4754
05:30:02,020 --> 05:30:03,880
Yeah, back one as long as you don't think he's gonna block.

4755
05:30:13,270 --> 05:30:13,510
Nice.

4756
05:30:17,520 --> 05:30:18,580
Oh, that life's back.

4757
05:30:19,360 --> 05:30:20,260
That's a wall combo.

4758
05:30:21,560 --> 05:30:21,920
Nice!

4759
05:30:23,100 --> 05:30:23,460
Oh.

4760
05:30:25,080 --> 05:30:26,060
Get off the ground!

4761
05:30:27,120 --> 05:30:27,460
Fish!

4762
05:30:28,740 --> 05:30:29,220
Pressure.

4763
05:30:29,480 --> 05:30:30,140
Mix, mix, mix!

4764
05:30:33,840 --> 05:30:34,400
What's that?

4765
05:30:40,390 --> 05:30:40,990
Rage art!

4766
05:30:41,150 --> 05:30:41,330
Rage art!

4767
05:30:43,550 --> 05:30:44,030
That's...

4768
05:30:44,290 --> 05:30:44,930
That's so close.

4769
05:30:44,930 --> 05:30:45,550
That's just gonna kill you.

4770
05:30:46,350 --> 05:30:47,530
Oh, it's so close.

4771
05:30:48,330 --> 05:30:54,490
In that situation, the hunter hunting bear stance 1 plus 2
would have worked, where you're in hunting and you back off.

4772
05:30:54,810 --> 05:30:55,530
It would have worked.

4773
05:30:57,510 --> 05:30:57,710
Yeah.

4774
05:30:57,710 --> 05:30:59,030
And if you did your wall...

4775
05:30:59,030 --> 05:31:00,390
When I said wall combo, you did it.

4776
05:31:00,410 --> 05:31:08,490
the wall combo there i mean he was dead yeah i thought i
couldn't because i blew my like i thought i blew something

4777
05:31:08,490 --> 05:31:15,990
that's fine you did your heat burst but that's fine they can
still do it and also when you got a wall spot you did g clef

4778
05:31:15,990 --> 05:31:21,910
and then you tried to do the back three plus four that's not
going to work because g clef counts as my tornado yeah so if

4779
05:31:21,910 --> 05:31:32,670
you g class at one if you g clef tornado then you can do
down back one plus two spam okay uh that the wall combo you

4780
05:31:32,670 --> 05:31:41,910
got this dude you already know what to do also when you get
mid-range he's free to while running one plus two round one

4781
05:31:41,910 --> 05:31:47,900
fight where's hot kick set

4782
05:31:58,460 --> 05:32:18,780
stop that's crazy man i can't believe that's crazy you got
this dude yeah only back one for the for the moves to nice

4783
05:32:20,080 --> 05:32:31,540

again after the tornado that's fine too yeah whatever smack

4784
05:32:31,540 --> 05:32:48,960
edge nice nice that's a reset you can back to one do you
regular combo yeah a forward to ray burst of heat

05:41:00,430 --> 05:41:01,150
Do it for the family.

4897
05:41:01,610 --> 05:41:01,750
No pressure.

4898
05:41:01,990 --> 05:41:02,690
Not that just.

4899
05:41:03,090 --> 05:41:03,830
Let's get it.

4900
05:41:06,550 --> 05:41:07,990
The after party, bro.

4901
05:41:09,970 --> 05:41:10,370
King.

4902
05:41:10,570 --> 05:41:11,970
They want to ban King.

4903
05:41:12,490 --> 05:41:13,590
I'm just right on it.

4904
05:41:14,230 --> 05:41:16,110
Well, three kings winning.

4905
05:41:17,490 --> 05:41:18,150
Well, well, well.

4906
05:41:18,510 --> 05:41:19,390
What up team Brawl Pro?

4907
05:41:20,050 --> 05:41:20,110
Hi.

What's good?

4911
05:41:23,930 --> 05:41:27,390
Can I just say congratulations to Doki for winning a trophy?

4912
05:41:27,630 --> 05:41:28,290
Let's fucking.

4913
05:41:28,770 --> 05:41:29,990
Oh, true.

4914
05:41:30,390 --> 05:41:31,190
That's for one person.

4915
05:41:31,730 --> 05:41:33,690
I have a 30 on defense.

4916
05:41:36,330 --> 05:41:39,010
Wait, you actually clutched up big time against us.

4917
05:41:39,010 --> 05:41:40,090
She did really well.

4918
05:41:40,370 --> 05:41:40,890
She did.

4919
05:41:41,170 --> 05:41:42,570
She really fucking did, dude.

4920
05:41:42,570 --> 05:41:48,050
That was on how many I feel like you've been putting in the
night shift is that is that the case like Doki's the late

4921
05:41:48,050 --> 05:41:50,730
night tech and grinder Yeah, I'm the late night tech and
grinder.

4922
05:41:50,910 --> 05:41:54,410
I only play tech in that night I look it's like 2 a.m.

4923

well I'm impressed with your performance Uh, first time that

4926
05:42:11,290 --> 05:42:17,350
we didn't see brawl pro have the clutch it up too i know
that's wrong actually because i had to get stony you

4927
05:42:17,350 --> 05:42:23,390

man that guy knows i'll just leave him alone like he leaves

4932
05:42:55,310 --> 05:43:00,650
me alone he thinks i'll figure it out myself i don't
understand but you know what he was right so he must be

4936
05:43:17,370 --> 05:43:23,870
every single set that I saw you play so yeah I played Tekken
until 7 a.m last minute because I was like there's no way

4937
05:43:23,870 --> 05:43:34,490
I'm fucking losing yeah and we covered like Alyssa and stuff
but not Zaf I don't think I I encountered a Zafina a Supreme

4938
05:43:34,490 --> 05:43:40,090
Zafina who I was just doing like a ranked grind like I kept
queuing into her at 7 a.m.

asking for a coach match if you guys want to pull up do it

4942

you're cool with it and evo doesn't mind if you want to pass

4943
05:44:15,770 --> 05:44:26,250
your trip down to second place i will fly out third place

Can I still go?

4947
05:44:44,530 --> 05:44:48,630
No, they said it would have been down to until Tony said, at
your ass.

4948
05:44:48,870 --> 05:44:50,690
So no, the orphans, no, not them either.

4949
05:44:50,850 --> 05:44:51,590
The orphans can't come.

4950
05:44:51,730 --> 05:44:52,030
Yeah, sorry.

4951
05:44:52,270 --> 05:44:53,570
So I got off the phone with Tony.

4952
05:44:54,910 --> 05:44:55,630
Seems understandable.

4953
05:44:56,010 --> 05:44:56,810
I'm down with that.

4954
05:44:57,010 --> 05:44:58,730
I guess I lost it for all of us, guys.

4955
05:44:58,890 --> 05:44:59,910
None of us are going to evil.

4956
05:44:59,990 --> 05:45:00,550
This is so sad.

4957
05:45:01,290 --> 05:45:02,130
Sorry, guys.

4958
05:45:02,590 --> 05:45:05,090
So, you know, thanks to all of you for playing, by the way.

05:45:05,930 --> 05:45:06,450
Thanks for having us.

4961
05:45:06,930 --> 05:45:08,370
Yeah, I'd love to do another.

4962
05:45:08,450 --> 05:45:11,450
If you ever do another Seijab slam, I'd love to join again.

4963
05:45:11,610 --> 05:45:12,250
It's been so fun.

4964
05:45:12,570 --> 05:45:13,510
No way.

4965
05:45:13,570 --> 05:45:14,090
Yeah, absolutely.

4966
05:45:14,510 --> 05:45:16,030
Good luck in your coaches match.

4967
05:45:16,190 --> 05:45:17,230
Why the fuck are you on Kuma?

4968
05:45:18,410 --> 05:45:19,170
Wait, he's playing Kuma.

4969
05:45:19,650 --> 05:45:21,230
Why the hell is this dude on Kuma?

4970
05:45:22,330 --> 05:45:23,430
Because Kuma's the goat.

4971
05:45:23,950 --> 05:45:25,270
Uh oh, big ass bear.

4972
05:45:25,630 --> 05:45:26,070
Watch out.

4973
05:45:26,170 --> 05:45:27,070
Oh my god.

4974
05:45:27,570 --> 05:45:28,090
Uh oh.

4975
05:45:29,970 --> 05:45:34,630
I played Fee with King twice already in both round robins.

4976
05:45:35,150 --> 05:45:35,550
Get him on.

4977
05:45:35,650 --> 05:45:36,970
He wouldn't expect it.

4978
05:45:39,170 --> 05:45:41,070
Broke him play a cat and a bear.

4979
05:45:41,070 --> 05:45:41,930
He's got a destruction bear, man.

4980
05:45:42,890 --> 05:45:43,330
joke.

4981
05:45:44,590 --> 05:45:46,190
Jesus Christ, that sounded like it hurt.

4982
05:45:47,950 --> 05:45:49,270
Yeah, you heard that shit?

4983
05:45:49,450 --> 05:45:50,430
Like a gunshot.

4984
05:45:50,730 --> 05:45:51,970
Spike to the ground, man.

4985
05:45:52,470 --> 05:45:52,550
Uh-oh.

4986
05:45:54,730 --> 05:45:56,530
Hit him with a cool move, coach.

4987
05:45:57,030 --> 05:45:57,330
Oh.

4988
05:45:58,230 --> 05:45:59,130
Do a cool move.

4989
05:45:59,830 --> 05:46:00,950
Yeah, do a cool move.

4990
05:46:01,310 --> 05:46:01,810
Coach, get up.

4991
05:46:01,870 --> 05:46:03,310
Do it.

4992
05:46:03,490 --> 05:46:04,050
Come on.

4993
05:46:04,130 --> 05:46:04,870
Do the move.

4994
05:46:05,390 --> 05:46:05,570
No.

4995
05:46:08,530 --> 05:46:10,450
Maybe we should have gone kick, coach.

4996
05:46:12,570 --> 05:46:13,750
Where's the king?

4997
05:46:13,970 --> 05:46:14,130
Go Paul.

4998
05:46:14,290 --> 05:46:14,510
Go Paul.

4999
05:46:15,170 --> 05:46:15,550
Go Paul.

5000
05:46:15,850 --> 05:46:16,550
Oh my god.

5001
05:46:16,550 --> 05:46:17,870
Please go Paul.

5002
05:46:18,830 --> 05:46:19,270
Oh my god.

5003
05:46:19,610 --> 05:46:20,130
Oh shit.

5004
05:46:20,310 --> 05:46:21,330
Congress in the universe.

5005
05:46:22,170 --> 05:46:22,690
Yeah.

5006
05:46:25,830 --> 05:46:27,970
I haven't played Paul in like two months.

5007
05:46:28,290 --> 05:46:29,130
I don't care bro.

5008
05:46:29,370 --> 05:46:29,850
Kick his ass.

5009
05:46:30,030 --> 05:46:30,150
Yeah.

5010
05:46:30,290 --> 05:46:31,270
Kick his ass.

5011
05:46:33,150 --> 05:46:35,010
He's only taking God supreme.

5012
05:46:35,530 --> 05:46:36,350
Let's do a cool move.

5013
05:46:37,070 --> 05:46:37,330
Yeah.

5014
05:46:37,670 --> 05:46:38,170
Oh.

5015
05:46:39,430 --> 05:46:41,610
Dude the alley kicks up before Kuma.

5016
05:46:44,350 --> 05:46:48,050
Oh, that's good.

5017
05:46:48,470 --> 05:46:50,050
Oh, that's good.

5018
05:46:50,050 --> 05:46:54,590
Oh, that's a fast move.

5019
05:46:59,570 --> 05:47:00,990
No way we go.

5020
05:47:01,810 --> 05:47:02,050
Okay.

5021
05:47:07,040 --> 05:47:08,020
Oh, got one move.

5022
05:47:08,700 --> 05:47:10,000
Oh, got one move.

5023
05:47:10,280 --> 05:47:10,560
He does.

5024
05:47:10,940 --> 05:47:11,640
What the fuck?

5025
05:47:13,740 --> 05:47:14,300
Yeah.

5026
05:47:14,300 --> 05:47:14,560
Yeah.

5027
05:47:14,800 --> 05:47:15,360
Yeah.

5028
05:47:15,380 --> 05:47:16,580
Coach, come on!

5029
05:47:16,640 --> 05:47:17,440
Oh, that's kind of pretty.

5030
05:47:17,540 --> 05:47:18,460
I like that.

5031
05:47:18,560 --> 05:47:18,940
Got her.

5032
05:47:19,060 --> 05:47:19,880
She got flowers on her shoulder.

5033
05:47:20,260 --> 05:47:20,780
Oh, nice!

5034
05:47:21,740 --> 05:47:22,700
Timing missile.

5035
05:47:25,340 --> 05:47:27,160
Do you think that thing tastes good?

5036
05:47:28,460 --> 05:47:29,620
We're gonna roast that.

5037
05:47:32,000 --> 05:47:33,040
Watch this mix.

5038
05:47:33,260 --> 05:47:33,920
Maybe I'm just hungry.

5039
05:47:35,140 --> 05:47:37,540
We've been playing Tekken for six hours.

5040
05:47:38,160 --> 05:47:39,440
Actually, I'm fucking starving.

5041
05:47:39,740 --> 05:47:40,980
What the fuck?

5042
05:47:43,200 --> 05:47:45,040

Come on.

5052
05:48:49,120 --> 05:48:50,920
You have to play until we get another set.

5053
05:48:51,060 --> 05:48:52,840
You gotta play king so we can get another set.

5054
05:48:54,020 --> 05:48:56,000
There's nothing wrong with bear.

5055
05:48:57,920 --> 05:48:59,180
You could play the bear.

5056
05:48:59,460 --> 05:49:00,460
I'll let you play bear.

5057
05:49:00,600 --> 05:49:01,460
Come on.

5058
05:49:01,760 --> 05:49:03,420
I do support bear, to be fair.

5059
05:49:03,580 --> 05:49:04,620
I'll support bear.

5060
05:49:04,920 --> 05:49:05,860
You've earned it, bro.

5061
05:49:05,960 --> 05:49:06,460
You've earned it.

5062
05:49:06,480 --> 05:49:07,360
Play who you want, bro.

5063
05:49:08,180 --> 05:49:08,540
Play who you want.

5064
05:49:08,540 --> 05:49:12,440
You're asking for a Paul, but I would, but I just haven't
played him like two months.

5065
05:49:12,640 --> 05:49:14,240
Make them play a different character.

5066
05:49:14,760 --> 05:49:15,360
He's so scared.

5067
05:49:15,380 --> 05:49:18,820
You are scared to play ball.

5068
05:49:20,000 --> 05:49:22,380
And that's, dare I say, pathetic.

5069
05:49:24,440 --> 05:49:25,280
That's a moral failing.

5070
05:49:25,960 --> 05:49:26,040
Yeah.

5071
05:49:28,520 --> 05:49:29,380

He's fun.

5073
05:49:31,280 --> 05:49:31,860
There you go.

5074
05:49:32,040 --> 05:49:33,260
Sit up your cell phone.

5075
05:49:38,140 --> 05:49:39,440
But we blocked that.

5076
05:49:39,980 --> 05:49:41,380
What's the cool combo?

5077
05:49:41,500 --> 05:49:43,300
Do the really cool showcase combo.

5078
05:49:44,620 --> 05:49:45,960
Kind of boring, coach.

5079
05:49:46,500 --> 05:49:46,960
Mm-hmm.

5080
05:49:47,520 --> 05:49:48,360

Oh, my God.

5264
06:00:20,590 --> 06:00:28,530
I, honestly, I did not expect to win against SK because SK
won against ESAM.

5265
06:00:29,230 --> 06:00:33,790
And then I did not know what the fuck ESAM was doing with
ESAM.

5266
06:00:34,050 --> 06:00:36,350
So I was so surprised.

5267
06:00:36,570 --> 06:00:38,910
I can't believe I won against SK.

5268
06:00:41,050 --> 06:00:49,870
I told guys I told you all I need to do was just nothing the
moment I stopped thinking like it works it just works my

5269
06:00:49,870 --> 06:00:56,830
brain I don't know what if I don't know what I'm doing she
doesn't know what I'm doing so she's confused and I'm

5270
06:00:56,830 --> 06:01:11,690
confused and then I won oh my god I can't believe it we
clutched it We might have lost the other games today, but we

5271
06:01:11,690 --> 06:01:18,590
won the finals match, which matters the most, because that
meant Brawl Pro didn't have to do the final coach in the

5272
06:01:18,590 --> 06:01:18,810
fight.

5273
06:01:22,610 --> 06:01:25,830
Once I relaxed, I started fucking.

5274
06:01:28,930 --> 06:01:31,530
Oh my god, I'm so happy.

5275
06:01:32,270 --> 06:01:33,950
I'm so, so, so happy, guys.

5276
06:01:34,070 --> 06:01:35,730
I'm really happy with this team.

5277
06:01:35,950 --> 06:01:38,490
It was such a great team.

5278
06:01:38,910 --> 06:01:43,930
Brawl Pro was actually, despite how much we roast Brawl Pro,
it was a great coach.

5279
06:01:45,030 --> 06:01:51,630
He taught me those six moves, the six most important moves
ever to get me here.

5280
06:01:55,970 --> 06:02:01,590
If it weren't for those six moves and that alley kick, I
would not have been here.

5281
06:02:03,950 --> 06:02:06,570
But thank you guys for cheering us on.

5282
06:02:08,910 --> 06:02:15,630

couldn't have asked for a better group of people to vibe

5283
06:02:15,630 --> 06:02:25,850

fucking arc for me fighting game arc we had there um the

day.

5288
06:02:54,910 --> 06:03:06,190
Like, my PC was so fucked until I fixed it today for just
this tournament, and we managed to clutch it.

5289
06:03:06,530 --> 06:03:07,250
