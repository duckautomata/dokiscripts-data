1
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:55,400
I had to take 20 hits because at the swap scenes!

2
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:01,000
He gets a free win!

3
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:09,220
Please.

4
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:12,580
Please.

5
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,280
Please!

6
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,640
Leave me alone!

7
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,940
I'm playing quick play because I don't want to lose Shinri.

8
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,280
I didn't want to lose Shinri before this stream.

9
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:52,350
I'm playing quick play because I don't want to lose Shinri.

10
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:41,690
I'm blocked!

11
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:42,930
Goodbye!

12
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:49,010
I won a quick play game.

13
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:49,730
Let's go!

14
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:53,870
Alright.

15
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:55,230
Nice.

16
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:56,030
Okay.

17
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,670
Yes, I am now Shinri!

18
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:00,510
Alright.

19
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:03,330
Okay.

20
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:05,150
Alright.

21
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:05,910
I'm ready.

22
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:07,390
I'm ready for the Yoshi.

23
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:10,510
I'm ready.

24
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:17,550
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, I didn't forget.

25
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:20,430
I got to Shinri!

26
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:22,530
I'm rigged up!

27
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,590
I'm like two rings...

28
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:26,190
Oh, Shinryu.

29
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:31,010
Shinri, Shinryu, it's the same.

30
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:34,550
Okay, I'm going into the main menu now.

31
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:35,950
I didn't forget.

32
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,520
Hey, hey, hey.

33
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,820
Not feeling good today?

34
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,400
I feel so good.

35
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:47,520
I'm not going to throw up.

36
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:47,940
You're ready to go.

37
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,240
Yeah, totally.

38
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:49,860
I didn't already.

39
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:53,040
Did you throw up from the pressure already?

40
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,360
No, no, no.

41
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,020
How are you feeling pressured?

42
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,840
You literally got coached, Matt!

43
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,620
You actually got coached this time!

44
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,200
I'm always pressured.

45
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,120
It's Sunday!

46
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,080
You rise again on Sunday!

47
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:09,980
I'm not!

48
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,040
Okay, I'm ready.

49
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:15,120
I'm ready for you.

50
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,400
Where's Slime?

51
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:24,380
The reason I was going to come here earlier and warm up, but I was just watching the Melee Restream with Slime the whole morning.

52
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:25,380
What?!

53
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,520
Yeah, I was watching Gommel too.

54
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,740
I can't believe it.

55
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,240
You guys are not serious.

56
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:33,060
Don't worry, I was practicing.

57
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:33,720
Okay, that's okay.

58
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:39,620
Me, Slime, or Coney just needs to lose one so we can force BrawlPro to play a game.

59
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:40,920
Why do you want to force that?

60
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,020
Why are we forcing it?

61
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,480
Because somebody didn't take it seriously.

62
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:45,340
Because you gotta earn it!

63
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:45,800
You gotta earn it!

64
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:45,820
Coach!

65
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:46,860
Yeah, you gotta earn it!

66
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:51,940
You fucking watched a different stream instead of help coaching us?

67
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:55,120
You're gonna slide off me, Doki, and Slime?

68
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:55,520
Yeah!

69
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,080
You gonna mooch off of us?

70
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:59,940
I'm gonna make sure Gommel hits every shot.

71
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:03,920
I'm just gonna throw up, bro.

72
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,100
You're just gonna...

73
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,540
On purpose.

74
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,180
Mine will be... Oh, such a sad accident.

75
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,680
I'm gonna blow all the funny moves.

76
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,240
Key charge in front of them.

77
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,340
Dude, I was playing Jack in Quick Play yesterday.

78
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,440
That character is so fucking funny.

79
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:24,600
He just... He has so many stupid moves that you would never do.

80
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,900
I love him.

81
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,260
Yeah, he's goofy.

82
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,600
Maybe that could be your number two.

83
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,140
I think I would like him more than Paul.

84
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:34,660
I played a little bit of Paul, and he's good.

85
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,400
But I think you have to be good at the game.

86
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,980
I think I could just do dumb funny shit with Jack.

87
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:39,820
You know?

88
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,960
And that'd be good.

89
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,600
I wish there were hero bans in Tekken.

90
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,000
Hero bans?

91
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:45,980
God.

92
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,780
Got that over-aught Gringotts.

93
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:48,960
I know that's you.

94
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:52,600
Could you imagine the level of play in this tournament if there were...

95
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,260
It would all just be like one-twos.

96
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,040
People would just be hitting one-twos over and over.

97
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,160
Okay.

98
00:06:59,460 --> 00:06:59,940
See?

99
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:00,500
Oh, wait.

100
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:02,300
What?

101
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:03,840
While standing.

102
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,060
There you go.

103
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:07,960
And then remember, Goomy's gonna mash after too.

104
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,200
So you gotta forward two-one after.

105
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:12,140
Remember?

106
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:14,860
Okay.

107
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,200
I mashed it!

108
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,860
Remember your forward two-one after?

109
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:20,800
Yeah.

110
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:21,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

111
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,380
Your two-elbow?

112
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

113
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,520
Because she'll mash after you punish her.

114
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,040
Oh, shit.

115
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:27,020
What the fuck?

116
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:28,500
Yes.

117
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:29,900
Nice.

118
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:30,660
Just like that.

119
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,420
And from a distance.

120
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,160
Okay.

121
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,540
It's okay.

122
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,000
It's okay.

123
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:38,780
That's why we're here.

124
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,480
No!

125
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,260
Oh, no.

126
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,400
Okay.

127
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:45,140
No!

128
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,980
See, this is why I knew this before our game.

129
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,840
She's grunting like she's getting hit in real life.

130
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:56,020
Yeah.

131
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,660
Oh, come on!

132
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,240
How come I couldn't get that?

133
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:02,020
There you go.

134
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:03,780
There you go.

135
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,420
Fucking warm up right here.

136
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:05,640
Yeah.

137
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:05,860
See?

138
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:06,120
See?

139
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,020
I'm warming up the fingers.

140
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:08,720
Okay.

141
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,640
This is not fair.

142
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:14,120
All right.

143
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:16,220
And then she also does that a lot.

144
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,140
Yeah!

145
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:17,980
Oh, shit.

146
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,220
Oh, shit.

147
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:19,620
That's right!

148
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:21,700
Okay.

149
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,420
That's not right.

150
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:23,400
And then she'll do it again after me.

151
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,200
That's not right.

152
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,000
That's not right.

153
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:27,840
No.

154
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:28,660
They're not gonna show me every mash.

155
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:29,180
Not?

156
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:29,480
Okay.

157
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,100
Yeah.

158
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,680
So it's gonna be one side of the bracket.

159
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:32,860
I don't know.

160
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:33,580
I'll have to chat, I guess.

161
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:33,960
Oh.

162
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:35,480
Oh.

163
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,860
Maybe while setting four after you duck it and then back three.

164
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:38,660
Okay.

165
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,760
Or, yeah, just while setting four and then back three.

166
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:42,580
All right.

167
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,640
Do you know while setting four the one you're doing to punish this one?

168
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:46,360
Yeah.

169
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,720
When you duck, just do it again.

170
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:51,100
Okay.

171
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:51,740
Or that.

172
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:56,280
I mean, you can do that if you want to if you're up for it.

173
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:00,140
That.

174
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:02,340
Okay.

175
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:04,380
Diane huh!

176
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,480
Zero.

177
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:06,620
What?!

178
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,060
It mashed the...

179
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,380
Sometimes, it doesn't register when I mash.

180
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:13,080
Okay, do it fire.

181
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:13,840
Yeah!

182
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:14,960
Hell, yeah.

183
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:15,840
Hell, yeah!

184
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:16,380
Yeah!

185
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:17,840
That's what's important.

186
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,040
Oh!

187
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,860
And remember that step, too.

188
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,080
That's a good way to make space.

189
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:23,760
Yeah.

190
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,040
Yeah!

191
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,340
See, I can learn!

192
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,060
Do it again, do it again.

193
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,600
The Jaguar step and then it's back 3 plus 4.

194
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,960
Yeah, and that's what sets up for your running knee.

195
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:38,060
Gumi will duck a lot when you're running up on her, so you gotta do that knee into the shoulder.

196
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:39,460
Okay.

197
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,880
Into your L3 or whatever that... yeah, that one.

198
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:45,340
Just hold forward and just mash that out.

199
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,160
Yeah!

200
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:49,860
I'm learning!

201
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:51,840
Wait, why are you BMing me?

202
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,320
Did you two...

203
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,600
Wait, no, no way!

204
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:57,640
I would never... I would never do that to the coach.

205
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,180
I would never.

206
00:09:58,580 --> 00:09:59,620
Yeah, exactly.

207
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:00,460
Wait, what?

208
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:01,520
How come I can't do that?

209
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:02,740
Okay.

210
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:10,290
How did you get yours over mine?

211
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:18,290
You have to just... right when you block, you don't even have to block and just yeah, just mash once more.

212
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,030
I smashed it!

213
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:23,630
Yeah.

214
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:24,270
It's an OS.

215
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:26,250
I MASHED IT!

216
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:27,210
THERE'S NO WAY!

217
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:30,750
It's only on block that you can mash it though.

218
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:33,430
Yes, yes.

219
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:36,570
Gumi will mash after so you can forward to 1-er right away.

220
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:38,870
Boom, boom.

221
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:40,050
Yeah, she's gonna get hit by that.

222
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:43,750
And then remember after that, then you can run up into all your bullshit.

223
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:46,610
And yeah, your heat stuff, everything.

224
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:47,190
Okay.

225
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:52,710
No, come on!

226
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:53,670
No!

227
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:55,110
Okay.

228
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,120
Oh my god.

229
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,340
What's up Matt?

230
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,440
Are they starting?

231
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,720
Should be starting.

232
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:06,680
Oh, they didn't.

233
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:06,840
Yeah.

234
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:11,200
I'm just saying because we gotta figure out where we're gonna fight.

235
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,540
Check the engines.

236
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:13,180
Chill dude again.

237
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,320
Oh my god.

238
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:16,520
Oh my god, no!

239
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:19,540
I got confused.

240
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:22,280
Why are you streaming Tekken and not Tekken 8?

241
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:23,960
Chill dude again.

242
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:24,900
I'm doing Tekken 1?

243
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,680
Yeah, you're streaming Tekken.

244
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,120
No caps, just Tekken.

245
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:28,900
Okay.

246
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,660
I got it.

247
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:32,980
Okay.

248
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,860
Team, we might be cooked.

249
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,420
What do you mean?

250
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:36,940
That's okay.

251
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:37,640
You know what?

252
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,480
I accept my fate.

253
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,340
I'm just kidding dude.

254
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,820
I'm just joking.

255
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,640
I'm trying my best.

256
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,160
You gotta mix it up!

257
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,240
You gotta mix it up because now I'm thinking about the spin!

258
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,880
You can't just keep going.

259
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,000
You can't just keep doing the same thing!

260
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,540
See, now I can block this now!

261
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,020
Dude, you're doing fine.

262
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,060
You gotta mix it up!

263
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,780
See, now I can...

264
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:11,420
Oh my god.

265
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:16,640
Alright.

266
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:18,020
Okay.

267
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:19,660
Alright.

268
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:20,940
No!

269
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:26,130
No.

270
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:26,270
No.

271
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:26,410
No.

272
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:26,430
No.

273
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:26,890
I forgot this.

274
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:32,050
Oh no, now I don't feel that confident anymore.

275
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:35,990
Oh yeah, and remember when we talked about how to wake up off the floor too?

276
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:36,390
Yeah.

277
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:40,910
Like one or two instead of... don't roll forward or you can just hold back sometimes.

278
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:43,130
But generally just hit one or two to get up.

279
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:45,010
And then when you get up, hold back after.

280
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:46,130
Okay.

281
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:48,130
Yeah, just like that.

282
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:49,030
That's a good way to get up.

283
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:51,030
Wait, why can't I lock?

284
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:51,490
Okay.

285
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:57,350
Yes!

286
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:57,910
Yes!

287
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:58,430
I'm doing it!

288
00:12:58,650 --> 00:12:59,290
I'm doing it!

289
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:02,510
Yeah, good job!

290
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:03,470
I'm doing it!

291
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:03,690
No!

292
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:06,550
I panicked.

293
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:09,630
Okay.

294
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:14,530
Okay, Dokie, if you duck this, do the same thing.

295
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:15,410
The while standing 4.

296
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:18,110
The same thing after you duck.

297
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:26,370
Let's see.

298
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:29,910
My fingers reflexively go to 3.

299
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:31,290
I see.

300
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:31,770
I see.

301
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:32,890
Yeah, but I'll go 4.

302
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:33,750
I'll try 4 again.

303
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:38,630
Standing 4.

304
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:41,710
So, can you do while standing 4 just in a neutral?

305
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:43,170
Like if you crouch and like that?

306
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:45,110
Yeah.

307
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:45,690
That, yeah.

308
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:46,270
That, yeah.

309
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:50,450
That's... after we duck, that's what... you basically let go, crouch and you hit 4 basically.

310
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:51,010
Yeah.

311
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:51,110
Okay.

312
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:53,670
And then after that, you can do back 3.

313
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:56,170
If you hop kick after it, sometimes it's not gonna work.

314
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:56,870
Okay.

315
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:00,490
And then you can back 3 there.

316
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:01,010
Okay.

317
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:02,290
And do your tornado.

318
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:04,030
Oh, no!

319
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:04,410
Fuck!

320
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:05,010
I... I...

321
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,410
Honestly, even... yeah, yeah.

322
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:11,250
Even if you don't get the full punish, as long as you're not getting hit by that, it's still...

323
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:11,470
Yeah.

324
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:12,410
...still pretty good.

325
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:14,810
Okay.

326
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:17,090
Fuck!

327
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:17,530
Bye.

328
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:18,730
And she'll always do it again, remember?

329
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:19,350
Yeah.

330
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:19,930
Every time.

331
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:23,450
So, block after she heat engages and then duck.

332
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:24,130
Okay.

333
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:25,330
Okay.

334
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:28,550
Yeah.

335
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:34,230
You can even back 3 off of standing 4 too even if you get that kick.

336
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:34,650
Okay.

337
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:37,290
Or, yeah.

338
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:38,150
You could do that too.

339
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:38,510
Okay.

340
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:39,850
You could back 3 by itself.

341
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:41,890
Yeah.

342
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:44,310
And then you do the jaguar bomb, the ender.

343
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:46,030
Yeah.

344
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:46,630
There you go.

345
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:47,070
Fuck it.

346
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:47,370
Fuck.

347
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:47,730
Okay.

348
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:48,250
Yeah.

349
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:49,770
And you can take your time with the ender.

350
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:50,050
Yeah.

351
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:51,150
You don't have to, you know.

352
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:53,210
Yes.

353
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:54,430
Yes!

354
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:55,310
Yes!

355
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:58,390
Yeah!

356
00:14:58,390 --> 00:14:58,730
Oh god!

357
00:14:59,230 --> 00:14:59,710
No!

358
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:05,640
Here we go.

359
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:22,230
And then remember, in this range right here, you have a good whiff punish that's a forward 2-1.

360
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:24,270
You see them whiffing?

361
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:27,730
Yeah, it's a good move in the mid-range at this level.

362
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:29,690
And then again, she's gonna start doing this from afar.

363
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:31,270
Okay, okay.

364
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:34,230
My mind didn't process it.

365
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:35,390
Okay, I'm ready.

366
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:36,830
There's three things.

367
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:38,090
Yeah, hopkick.

368
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:41,250
Hopkick before you think you have to.

369
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:41,850
Okay.

370
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:44,050
Okay.

371
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:48,470
It's not easy.

372
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:50,750
Fuck this, I'm doing this.

373
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:52,050
This is easier.

374
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:55,950
And then you can do the two kicks after and then back three, remember?

375
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:56,890
Okay, try it.

376
00:15:58,410 --> 00:15:59,210
It's easier.

377
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:01,370
That's easier!

378
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:03,310
Yeah.

379
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:12,670
What?!

380
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,560
Okay, whatever.

381
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,860
Well, that didn't work.

382
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:25,420
What?!

383
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,540
Yeah, that move sucks.

384
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:28,580
I'm not gonna lie.

385
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,520
I hate this move so much!

386
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,680
You're doing good against it.

387
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:36,520
Yes.

388
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:36,980
Yes.

389
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,340
Oh, are you on your new PC now?

390
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,540
We didn't lag at all.

391
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:42,360
Um...

392
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,300
I fixed it.

393
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:47,360
Wait, what?

394
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:48,900
IT Dosey?

395
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:49,780
I fixed it.

396
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:53,520
Oh, yeah.

397
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:57,140
And remember, you got the back three 1 plus 2.

398
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:59,520
Pretend it's like a string and hit that.

399
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,360
Back three 1 plus 2, remember?

400
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,440
Okay, back three 1 plus 2.

401
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:03,800
Okay.

402
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:05,540
The 1 plus 2 button.

403
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:07,920
Pretend it's a string and it should work or match it up.

404
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:09,180
Oh, no, that's not it.

405
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:16,940
You know that back three and it leads into the leg drop, remember?

406
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:17,400
Yeah.

407
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:18,460
Yeah.

408
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:19,820
Try that.

409
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,160
Oh!

410
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:23,600
Okay.

411
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,400
Ah!

412
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:26,800
Okay.

413
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:27,720
No!

414
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,200
No!

415
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:31,540
No!

416
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,440
You can just hold 1 plus 2 afterwards.

417
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:41,980
Try that, Dokie, if you back three 1 plus 2 and you just hold it after.

418
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:42,760
Back three...

419
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,340
Oh, maybe it's easy.

420
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,440
Okay.

421
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,000
Yeah, what's your...

422
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,560
Okay, they're starting now.

423
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,500
Okay, there you go.

424
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,480
And the shoulder after, remember?

425
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:51,060
Yeah.

426
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,200
Yeah, that thing.

427
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,720
It's gonna destroy people.

428
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:57,520
I just can't get it the timing correctly.

429
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,500
Okay, now put me on the other side.

430
00:17:59,500 --> 00:17:59,940
Put me on the other side, please.

431
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:01,020
Thank you.

432
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:03,060
Oh.

433
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:03,440
Alright.

434
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:06,160
Are they starting the matches now?

435
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:07,180
Yeah.

436
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:09,700
Okay, I'm gonna watch...

437
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:10,980
Who are we watching?

438
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,760
Um, we're gonna watch the main channel.

439
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:18,560
Who is playing on the main channel?

440
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,400
The Stay Jam stream.

441
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,320
You can watch that.

442
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,560
I'm gonna do warm-up games with my other monitor.

443
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,940
I guess I'll pull up the matches for my stream.

444
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:29,400
Alright.

445
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:30,680
Who do...

446
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,420
I don't know.

447
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,920
Who do we watch, guys?

448
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,620
While I practice too.

449
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:38,080
It sucks because no one fucking plays Yoshi.

450
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:39,940
I literally...

451
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:44,280
Every time I rank when I find a Yoshi player, I just be like, please fight me.

452
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:47,640
Stream's like, Gumi, she's too low elo to fight me.

453
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:48,740
I'm sorry.

454
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:49,420
Is that mean?

455
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,540
Like in the rank.

456
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,700
I can't fucking get into rank matches.

457
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,400
Unless she does like...

458
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,020
I do plus...

459
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:57,320
I do minus plus two.

460
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:58,640
And I'm...

461
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,280
Senior...

462
00:18:59,280 --> 00:18:59,820
Senior...

463
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,020
Right now.

464
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:04,820
So like I play against Vanquisher and...

465
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,680
Which one is it?

466
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:07,400
I like...

467
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,160
Because I have a...

468
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:12,180
I strictly do like only within two of my ranks.

469
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:15,620
And I don't think she's within two of my ranks at the moment.

470
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,100
It's not toxic!

471
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:17,740
I can't...

472
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,060
Literally can't stream stay.

473
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:26,880
Rank is Gumi.

474
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,050
She's on Destroyer.

475
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:28,920
Okay.

476
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:29,340
Okay.

477
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,580
She's on Destroyer.

478
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,040
Oh, she's playing now.

479
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,580
All right, let's see.

480
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,020
It's not toxic!

481
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,620
I literally can't stream snipe her in rank.

482
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:42,020
I'm watching it right now.

483
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,240
I'm watching how...

484
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,060
Oh my gosh.

485
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:47,320
Amore's being the shit out of Gumi.

486
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,420
Like what is she doing?

487
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,100
Cause like...

488
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,100
I always...

489
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,420
The only thing that she fucks me up on is the spin.

490
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:56,440
That's literally it.

491
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:58,420
It's the fucking spin.

492
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,200
Yeah, you gotta play one of these two.

493
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:06,080
Yeah, I'm surprised.

494
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:07,720
Like what is Amore doing?

495
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,080
That's different from what I was doing.

496
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:11,820
Oh, she knows combos.

497
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:12,680
That's what's different.

498
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,760
She actually knows combos.

499
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:19,720
Damn!

500
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:21,400
Oh my God.

501
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,120
My God, why can't I do that?

502
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:29,340
Wait.

503
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:29,800
She's not doing anything.

504
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,300
Is she doing a spin?

505
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:30,780
Wait, what?

506
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,220
She is.

507
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,480
Wait, Amore's going crazy.

508
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:40,760
Oh my God.

509
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,200
She actually knows combos.

510
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,620
Dude, did you see that combo she did?

511
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:46,440
Kony doesn't even do that one.

512
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,540
What the fuck?

513
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,080
She knows combos.

514
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,280
That's fucking crazy.

515
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,520
How is that possible?

516
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:53,560
Hahaha!

517
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:55,620
Hahaha!

518
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,000
Round one.

519
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,480
Fight.

520
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,120
In.

521
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:05,820
Oh my gosh.

522
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:06,580
Wait, what?

523
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,600
I wish I know combos.

524
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:16,020
I know this though.

525
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:16,620
Yeah!

526
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,280
That's all I need to know.

527
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,700
Okay, maybe not.

528
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:23,460
Maybe not.

529
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,100
I'm so sorry.

530
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,560
That's not all I need to know.

531
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:26,100
You're right.

532
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:27,000
You're right.

533
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,820
Oh my God.

534
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:32,220
Maybe not.

535
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,560
Maybe I need to know more of that.

536
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,440
Oh, goodbye.

537
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,000
Oh wait, what?

538
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:41,880
Okay.

539
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:45,900
Okay.

540
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:46,900
I'm surprised.

541
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,040
Oh my God.

542
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,280
He low parries that.

543
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,580
It's like he knows.

544
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:51,680
Hahaha.

545
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:53,040
He's the champ.

546
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,520
Round two.

547
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,080
Fight.

548
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:58,760
Okay.

549
00:21:59,080 --> 00:21:59,840
That's fine.

550
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:00,800
That's fine.

551
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,780
That's fine.

552
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:02,200
It's not fair.

553
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,780
How do all these players know combos?

554
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:11,800
Like, how do you stay in tenure knowing all these combos when I can abuse certain stuff to Shinryu?

555
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:12,960
Hahaha.

556
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,940
All I'm saying is like, I don't know.

557
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:25,280
If I don't know combos and I can get to this rank in one week, maybe these players are...

558
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:25,920
Hahaha.

559
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:26,700
Hahaha.

560
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:35,160
Oh yeah, yesterday in rank, I bumped into a... in rank, I had to fight a purple.

561
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,480
And they were like a TTV-er.

562
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:40,820
So then I looked at their TTV, and I was like...

563
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:46,660
And then I looked at their VODs, and it took them like one month of playing.

564
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:51,660
Because they were like hard stuck red for like so long.

565
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:56,040
And then they recently like yesterday got to purple.

566
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:00,360
And it took them like a month straight of playing Tekken to get there.

567
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,880
And I'm like, bro, what?

568
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,800
It took me one week to get to red.

569
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:12,860
I feel like if I commit another week, maybe I'll learn how to get to...

570
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:16,500
Because they were... I was like looking at their VODs, and I was like, oh shit, they're...

571
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:20,820
They're... I was just like...

572
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:28,380
I was like, they've been playing rank every day for a month straight from red to purple.

573
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,540
Playing... Bro, that guy was a king player!

574
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,840
You can't say that!

575
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,620
Don't you definitely stay aggressive against her?

576
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,880
That guy was a king player, so I was like watching.

577
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,040
Because I was like, oh hey, a fellow king.

578
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:45,460
Who's in purple?

579
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:47,280
Let me see your fucking thing.

580
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:59,540
Getting to purple is the one Tekken...

581
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:01,960
He's playing king wrong.

582
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:06,400
Bro, I fucking hate fighting all the...

583
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,260
Okay, this one's new.

584
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:07,560
Okay.

585
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:12,240
I swear, every time I see an arena player, I'm just like, I'm done.

586
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:12,980
I'm tired.

587
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:13,900
I'm so tired.

588
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:20,600
I'm so tired of playing against all the arenas!

589
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,640
Thank god this is quick play.

590
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,240
I really don't want to play rank right now.

591
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,680
I grinded rank a lot yesterday and I'm tired.

592
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:33,840
That's good!

593
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,100
I'm so happy I can play someone else that's...

594
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:43,960
I'm tired of playing against all the fucking arenas and paws and fucking dragon elves and laws.

595
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:45,520
Like, I'm tired.

596
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:46,180
I'm so tired.

597
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,120
And Alyssa's too.

598
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,700
I want to play new characters.

599
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:51,560
I'm fine with playing against Claudio if he's someone new.

600
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:54,300
I'm... God, get away from me!

601
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:55,140
I'm streaming!

602
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:01,100
I'm streaming!

603
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,480
Okay.

604
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,160
So glad I played against him.

605
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,000
Yeah, because like, his moves aren't fucking bullshit.

606
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:17,300
Like, I can actually get out of the moves later.

607
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:21,100
I say... Like, look, see, I can actually get up.

608
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:23,740
When I play against Reyna, I like fucking...

609
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:26,340
Like, just not play for like 20 minutes.

610
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:28,720
Say he's the king player, to be fair.

611
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:34,120
Say he's the king player.

612
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,260
Look, I'm just done.

613
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:38,860
Yeah!

614
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,300
Now we're at the other wall!

615
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,200
No, my other wall!

616
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:46,940
Yeah!

617
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:48,320
Timed correctly!

618
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:51,840
Oh.

619
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:54,360
Okay.

620
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:56,440
Nice.

621
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:57,280
Goodbye.

622
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,120
Oh, no!

623
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:07,220
No!

624
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:07,660
No!

625
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,020
Please!

626
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:08,820
Leave me alone!

627
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,200
Leave me alone!

628
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:10,900
No!

629
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,280
Take me back to the other side!

630
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,220
I don't like being on this side!

631
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:17,260
They don't know I can't play... I literally cannot play on this side.

632
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,060
Like, it's actually so bad.

633
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,100
If they put me on this side, I'm helpless.

634
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,600
I'm like a sheep.

635
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:28,520
They don't know.

636
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,960
They don't know on this side I'm scared.

637
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:39,500
The right side is where... where things go down.

638
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:45,200
I just don't know how to... Like, okay, like my brain can't fucking reverse the input.

639
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:48,060
That's the thing.

640
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:51,100
I have to reverse the input and I don't know how to do that.

641
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:54,140
Get ready for the next battle!

642
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:56,440
I don't know how to reverse inputs.

643
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:59,860
Why say that before...

644
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:02,160
Cause then they have to take me to the other side!

645
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:05,440
They gotta figure out how to put me on the other side!

646
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:13,220
They gotta figure it out first how to put me there.

647
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,540
Cause it's usually I put myself there.

648
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,700
That's the thing.

649
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,680
I put myself out on the other side.

650
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:29,660
It's usually not like... Usually not the enemy team that does it.

651
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:30,080
It's me.

652
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:31,680
Oh my god, please.

653
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,720
I'm so sorry.

654
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,780
Yeah, I saw Goomy at one.

655
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:38,900
Yo, Matt.

656
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,320
Yeah, what's up, dude?

657
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,420
Um, are you watching?

658
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:45,180
Not really.

659
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:48,660
What's going on?

660
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,660
It's kinda crazy.

661
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:51,620
What?

662
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:52,040
What happened?

663
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:53,600
Fight!

664
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:54,640
I don't know.

665
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:57,620
These two girls just now were fucking insane.

666
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,840
Oh, Goomy versus Amore?

667
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:00,880
I have no way of the monitor.

668
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:01,440
Yeah.

669
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:02,220
Oh, please!

670
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:03,720
Please!

671
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:04,800
Leave me alone!

672
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:07,520
Please!

673
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,480
Just a helpless King player!

674
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,120
Leave me alone!

675
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,640
I don't know what I'm doing!

676
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,720
This is my first fighting game!

677
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:23,020
You've been playing fighting games your whole fucking life!

678
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,760
I'm just a silly jaguar!

679
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:33,960
Oh, fuck.

680
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:34,600
I missed it.

681
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:38,700
I'm streaming!

682
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:39,560
Leave me alone!

683
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,180
How do you know that?

684
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:48,160
You can tell.

685
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,020
Because he knows combos.

686
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,760
The most...

687
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,120
The most...

688
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,340
New fighting players don't know what...

689
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:01,720
People who never play fighting games barely register combos.

690
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:05,320
We just fucking play... We just press the buttons that we know works.

691
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:11,380
Wheeee!

692
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,020
Just learn combos.

693
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,300
No, that's just you?

694
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:16,640
No.

695
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:17,860
No.

696
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:24,340
All I'm saying is if you know combos and you're still in Shinri, then like you've been a fighting player for so long.

697
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:26,420
Because like...

698
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,600
Because you just do the...

699
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,260
You just listen to what...

700
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:32,280
That all the guides tell you to.

701
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:33,280
You know what I mean?

702
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,860
You like... You don't come up with your own strategies to climb the ranks.

703
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,740
You like follow...

704
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,220
What the sheep... You're like a sheep.

705
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:44,420
So you follow what they tell you to do because it's what's right.

706
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,560
It's what's always been.

707
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:48,080
But like those who are new to fighting games...

708
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,580
They like see and don't like have like...

709
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,640
Don't have like background in fighting games.

710
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:54,320
We basically...

711
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:59,980
We come up with our own strategies that we see that works and then abuse it until it stops working.

712
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,840
And then we have to come up with our new...

713
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:02,720
With new strategies.

714
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:05,220
But people with fighting game experience...

715
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:09,300
They just come in doing the same combos over and over and over again.

716
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,920
And like doing the like...

717
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:11,940
The foundation stuff.

718
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:16,800
Because they're taught from fighting game experience that that is how to do.

719
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:19,320
Like that is like what you have to do to climb.

720
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,680
And if I can just abuse simple buttons...

721
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:27,920
And just not knowing what the fuck I'm doing and get to this elo...

722
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,240
That means I'm not from this...

723
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,420
I'm not from this community.

724
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:40,930
Okay.

725
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:42,090
No!

726
00:30:47,810 --> 00:30:48,410
Nice.

727
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:48,810
Goodbye.

728
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:49,870
Goodbye!

729
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:54,670
Oh shit.

730
00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:55,930
Goodbye to me.

731
00:30:57,570 --> 00:30:58,410
Oh boy!

732
00:30:58,410 --> 00:30:58,510
Oh please!

733
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:01,750
I haven't registered pattern yet.

734
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:09,550
You can get stuck playing a certain...

735
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:10,310
You can get stuck?

736
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:11,850
Yeah but the thing is...

737
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:13,050
I just need to learn a new...

738
00:31:13,050 --> 00:31:14,110
New cheese.

739
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:14,830
That's it.

740
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:17,870
Every time I learn a new cheese like I climb.

741
00:31:18,930 --> 00:31:21,310
Like and I just need to learn a new cheese.

742
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:22,830
In this elo.

743
00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:26,750
It just works!

744
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:30,190
Okay.

745
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:32,890
Oh fuck.

746
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:33,170
Oh.

747
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:33,770
Whoops.

748
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:36,590
Stop.

749
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:38,950
Stop.

750
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:39,690
Stop.

751
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:43,370
Oh fuck!

752
00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:44,110
He didn't stop.

753
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:45,630
Why didn't you stop?

754
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:48,110
I don't understand.

755
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:49,310
Why didn't you stop?

756
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:50,930
Oh!

757
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:53,170
Stop!

758
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:55,950
Fight.

759
00:31:59,160 --> 00:31:59,440
Fight.

760
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,020
Fight.

761
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:00,620
Fight.

762
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:00,800
Oh.

763
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:02,060
Nice.

764
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,140
Got that.

765
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,560
Boom!

766
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:06,540
Boom!

767
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:08,920
Okay.

768
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,200
Yeah!

769
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,480
Stop!

770
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:14,260
Stop!

771
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:20,120
It's true.

772
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,040
I just need to...

773
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:21,360
Whoa!

774
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:23,860
But does that stop from there?

775
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:24,800
No!

776
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:25,580
Wait what?

777
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:26,500
How?

778
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:28,740
Whoa!

779
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:30,600
Yeah!

780
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:30,720
Whoa!

781
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:30,740
Get away!

782
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,220
Go away!

783
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,160
Whoa!

784
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:33,060
He ducked!

785
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:35,440
Cat duck forever!

786
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:37,200
Bam!

787
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,700
Because I play King!

788
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,720
That's fucking right!

789
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:44,980
Stay on the ground!

790
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,060
Nobody likes you!

791
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,200
Not even your mom.

792
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,720
Not get ally kicked to death.

793
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,920
I don't even earn elo for that.

794
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:57,800
I tried because I hate you.

795
00:32:59,260 --> 00:32:59,780
There.

796
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:11,020
Okay guys, look at... look at like... we were checking our play data.

797
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,000
Look at my defense guys.

798
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,940
Wait, where is it?

799
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:18,860
Performance stats.

800
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,160
Look at my...

801
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:35,240
It's so bad.

802
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:38,180
It's so bad.

803
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:52,460
We were comparing our D's... our stats... our stats to people.

804
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:55,500
And it's so bad.

805
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:02,420
I don't fucking...

806
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:08,200
How the fuck do people... How the fuck do people let me get away with this?

807
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:11,160
How do people let me climb to this?

808
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:23,420
Look, this is the Tekken 8 community's fault for putting me... for letting me climb this high.

809
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:33,700
Exactly.

810
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:39,700
Why do I need defense if... if I could just kill them?

811
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:43,820
You have been enabled.

812
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,920
Look at that.

813
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,580
It's just that easy.

814
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:51,260
Look at that.

815
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:51,260
It's just that easy.

816
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:52,220
Woooo!

817
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:58,780
Yeah, never need to learn throw techs if I'm doing the throwing.

818
00:34:59,160 --> 00:34:59,260
Yeah, never need to learn throw techs if I'm doing the throwing.

819
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,720
That is so true.

820
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:05,980
That is so fucking true.

821
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:09,200
I don't know any throws... like I don't know how to do any tech stuff.

822
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,140
All I do is... grapple.

823
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:15,800
Crap.

824
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:22,140
Only cowards.

825
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:24,340
Yeah, accept your throws.

826
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:25,560
Accept your fate.

827
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,760
You know what you're getting into.

828
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:31,400
Just lie back and think of Paris.

829
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:36,020
While I throw you to the fucking ground.

830
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:40,500
Exactly.

831
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,080
Take the throw!

832
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:46,380
Oh shit.

833
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:47,180
Sir.

834
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:47,820
Sir.

835
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:48,860
Please.

836
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:51,800
All I know, I don't know how to D.

837
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:53,260
Take this.

838
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,060
That's fucking right.

839
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:55,920
Yeah, that's right.

840
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:56,760
And this!

841
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:58,020
And this!

842
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:58,720
Oh shit!

843
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,280
Okay, you actually... you don't block.

844
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:01,180
Okay, so...

845
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:03,900
Okay, so that's good to know.

846
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:05,700
That's good to know you don't duck.

847
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:06,820
Like, I like that.

848
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,500
That's the king's dream right there.

849
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:16,600
Take my throw!

850
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:17,980
Yeah!

851
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:20,060
And again!

852
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,380
Oh wait, sorry.

853
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:23,840
Oh shit, sorry.

854
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:25,380
He doesn't want me to throw him.

855
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:26,440
I don't know why.

856
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:29,800
Why won't you want me to fucking throw you?

857
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,140
People fucking line up for that.

858
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:36,200
Oh my god, he's staying on the ground now.

859
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:39,540
It's like...

860
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,540
A lifetime opportunity.

861
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,080
Yay.

862
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:44,820
Stay on the ground.

863
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:49,320
Why is she getting away with it?

864
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:50,300
That's what I'm saying.

865
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:54,020
A lot of these fighting players in this elo, they have like...

866
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:57,640
They just follow what the sheep tell them to do.

867
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:01,580
And because of that, they don't know what to do when someone does something different.

868
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,100
As in five alley kicks in a row.

869
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,120
It's just so fucked up.

870
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,420
They're just... they're so confused.

871
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:12,300
They're like, what?

872
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:15,340
How is she letting you get away with this?

873
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,800
You just don't know.

874
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,840
They're so confused when people do that.

875
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,360
Because it's so unorthodox.

876
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:28,320
So I just like abuse the stuff that they don't... are not used to.

877
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:35,640
Oh, he does that same move over and over again.

878
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:37,780
Yeah, let me... let me breathe.

879
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,480
Let me breathe.

880
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:39,100
Let me breathe.

881
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:42,440
Oh my god.

882
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,260
That's fucking right.

883
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:46,420
Oh, you fucking counted that?

884
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:47,660
That's not fair!

885
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:48,980
Oh, you counted that too.

886
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:51,220
That's fine.

887
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,560
Oh shit, it's not fine?

888
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:54,420
Question?

889
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:55,080
Whoa!

890
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,040
That's my move.

891
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:00,780
Okay.

892
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,760
He does that all the time.

893
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:06,880
Nice.

894
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,120
And then I do that.

895
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,900
And then I rush in!

896
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,020
Wait, what?

897
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:17,420
Oh, I'm not even...

898
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:17,740
There you go.

899
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:18,060
See that?

900
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:18,940
You like that little spin?

901
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,700
I did... oh shit.

902
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:21,020
Whoops.

903
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,260
Oh, I still have this.

904
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:26,000
I didn't even realize I still have my heat.

905
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:28,120
Oh, no.

906
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:28,680
No!

907
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:29,540
No!

908
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:31,400
I pressed the wrong button!

909
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,700
Oh, it's fine.

910
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,560
He pressed the wrong button too.

911
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:37,080
Oh my god!

912
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,360
That's so fucked up!

913
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,980
It would be a shame if he died like this.

914
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:44,680
Goodbye.

915
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:47,200
Fucking go back to yellow rank.

916
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,660
And you don't get a rematch.

917
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,080
Get outplayed.

918
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,200
Yay!

919
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:09,560
Yippee!

920
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,120
Yay!

921
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:15,940
Okay.

922
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,900
Not toxic at all.

923
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:22,560
Oh my god.

924
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:23,440
A fellow King player.

925
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:25,020
Show me.

926
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:27,660
This is going to be a King player to actually know his combos.

927
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:36,860
Oh my god!

928
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:38,660
He actually knows how to do that!

929
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:39,840
Oh, he jumped.

930
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:40,520
I should have...

931
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:41,760
I need to know how...

932
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,640
Remember to...

933
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:46,340
Oh my god, he did that thing!

934
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,140
My coach keeps telling me to do!

935
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:49,760
My god!

936
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,520
That's fucking right!

937
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,280
You should learn how to do that too!

938
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:00,400
Oh shit.

939
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:01,480
Oh shit.

940
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,000
Never mind.

941
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:02,820
I'm a king player.

942
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:03,520
I don't know how to tech.

943
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:06,240
I don't know how to tech that.

944
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:17,140
Oh, that sidestep.

945
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:17,900
He fucking knows.

946
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:20,820
It's not fair.

947
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:22,180
You're also a king.

948
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,060
You know what I want to do.

949
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:27,560
That's fucking right.

950
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,000
Oh, that's not right.

951
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:29,920
He threw me away.

952
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:41,760
Oh my god.

953
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:45,620
He's doing all the king stuff I would do!

954
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:46,580
Back to me!

955
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:49,160
Who is he?

956
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,040
He's in my mind!

957
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:59,160
What the fuck!

958
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,400
He's actually in my mind!

959
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,600
Oh my god!

960
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,340
Oh my god!

961
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:13,380
He's fucking rock, paper, scissoring me correctly!

962
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,820
That's actually crazy!

963
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:23,620
See, this is a king player that knows his shit.

964
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:26,880
But yet, he's still in Vanquisher, so that's embarrassing.

965
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:33,840
You clearly know what you're doing!

966
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:35,460
How are you in this elo?

967
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,180
You're losing it.

968
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:45,600
I don't know how he's in this... in Vanquisher.

969
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:52,040
If he can do all that and he's still stuck in Vanquisher...

970
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:01,140
Bad matchup exists, Doki.

971
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:05,040
If bad matchup exists, how would they let me into this elo?

972
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:08,280
I cannot get all good matchups for this.

973
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,440
That's all I'm saying.

974
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:14,020
That's all I'm saying, guys.

975
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:18,380
Boop.

976
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:19,020
Boop.

977
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:23,400
I lost, therefore you should be embarrassed.

978
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:27,540
If you could do all that and you're still here?

979
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:29,500
You're still in Vanquisher?

980
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,880
That's probably like his second...

981
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,720
Why would you create smurf accounts for this?

982
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:40,580
Don't you need to pay for it?

983
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:43,000
Don't you need to buy more tech in the...

984
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,060
Oh, I guess if you play on console, you don't have to.

985
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:46,640
That makes sense.

986
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:50,240
If you play on console, you don't have to create new smurf accounts.

987
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:53,980
I was just thinking like, that's crazy.

988
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,220
To still win.

989
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:02,260
That's true.

990
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:04,740
His power level was like 145.

991
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:08,880
He must have been like a god or something in his main character.

992
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:11,100
And this was just his side project.

993
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:16,070
Boop.

994
00:43:16,830 --> 00:43:17,390
Okay.

995
00:43:17,550 --> 00:43:19,190
I know like this move.

996
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:20,870
And then...

997
00:43:20,870 --> 00:43:21,230
Boop.

998
00:43:22,110 --> 00:43:22,870
And then...

999
00:43:22,870 --> 00:43:24,370
I try to do this correctly.

1000
00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:25,870
But I always fuck it up.

1001
00:43:27,810 --> 00:43:28,950
Because it's like...

1002
00:43:28,950 --> 00:43:31,950
There's no scenario where people would let me do that.

1003
00:43:33,910 --> 00:43:34,770
I don't...

1004
00:43:34,770 --> 00:43:37,250
I don't know when I can do this.

1005
00:43:37,350 --> 00:43:38,290
It's not fair.

1006
00:43:43,590 --> 00:43:44,150
Boom.

1007
00:43:45,970 --> 00:43:47,510
Like this is a...

1008
00:43:47,510 --> 00:43:48,750
Oh, and then I can do this.

1009
00:43:49,150 --> 00:43:49,610
Yeah.

1010
00:43:55,330 --> 00:43:56,650
Remember your training?

1011
00:43:56,850 --> 00:43:57,650
I am.

1012
00:43:57,650 --> 00:43:58,810
I'm trying my best.

1013
00:43:58,930 --> 00:43:59,410
I'm scared.

1014
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:05,610
I haven't been nervous at all throughout this event until now.

1015
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:11,590
This is where I've never been so nervous before.

1016
00:44:11,670 --> 00:44:12,170
I'm nervous.

1017
00:44:15,730 --> 00:44:16,270
I'm nervous.

1018
00:44:16,270 --> 00:44:16,510
Yeah.

1019
00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:23,170
No, because now it matters.

1020
00:44:25,970 --> 00:44:27,930
Before it didn't really matter.

1021
00:44:27,990 --> 00:44:28,850
Now it matters.

1022
00:44:33,450 --> 00:44:35,310
Remember to block with what?

1023
00:44:35,330 --> 00:44:36,310
My 30 fucking block?

1024
00:44:36,430 --> 00:44:36,850
Watch this.

1025
00:44:38,330 --> 00:44:39,970
Oh, he blocked too.

1026
00:44:42,370 --> 00:44:44,450
It was cool for a second though.

1027
00:44:48,670 --> 00:44:52,330
Not gonna lie, it was pretty cool when I did make it work though.

1028
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:58,460
Oh God.

1029
00:44:59,420 --> 00:44:59,940
Oh.

1030
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:05,340
Oh my God.

1031
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:08,700
I don't know his fucking moveset.

1032
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:11,700
Get over here.

1033
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:12,440
Get over here.

1034
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:12,920
Oh shit.

1035
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:14,680
Let me back on the other side.

1036
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:15,860
Hahahaha.

1037
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:18,900
Fight.

1038
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:21,400
Oh.

1039
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:21,500
Oh.

1040
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:24,620
Oh no!

1041
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:25,780
Oh no, he punished me!

1042
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,640
Oh no, he punished me!

1043
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:28,600
No!

1044
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:29,640
Let me back up!

1045
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:30,320
Let me back up!

1046
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:31,060
No!

1047
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:32,860
Okay.

1048
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:34,800
Bye.

1049
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:41,900
I think he blocks that.

1050
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:42,800
Yeah, I was gonna say.

1051
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:46,420
I'm pretty sure he would like fucking...

1052
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:48,860
That's right!

1053
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:50,560
Alley kick!

1054
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:51,080
Alley kick!

1055
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:51,540
Alley kick!

1056
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:52,540
Alley kick!

1057
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:52,860
Oh!

1058
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:54,120
I'm sorry!

1059
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:00,600
I'm sorry!

1060
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:03,940
It didn't mean to alley kick you 20 times!

1061
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:12,780
But what if I do it again?

1062
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:14,000
Oh shit, I'm sorry.

1063
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:17,100
Oh my god, please leave me alone.

1064
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:19,480
Wait, what?

1065
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:20,460
I don't slam that?

1066
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:22,480
Oh.

1067
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:25,480
Oh, he blocks it.

1068
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:29,000
Oh, I should have RROC'd him or RDK'd him.

1069
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:31,360
Does he block?

1070
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:33,940
What?!

1071
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:35,860
How is he so fast?!

1072
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:38,680
Someone check this man's system!

1073
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:39,920
Make him pee in the cup!

1074
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:45,360
I'm not mashing.

1075
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:49,080
I have a strategic way of doing my buttons.

1076
00:46:55,410 --> 00:46:55,890
Ooh!

1077
00:46:55,890 --> 00:46:57,110
Mashing can't get me down.

1078
00:46:57,130 --> 00:46:57,310
This!

1079
00:46:57,450 --> 00:46:57,550
Oh.

1080
00:47:00,030 --> 00:47:02,330
Oh, I can't remember if he's faster than me always.

1081
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,620
He's always faster than me.

1082
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:09,660
So it sucks.

1083
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:11,000
Uuugh!

1084
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:16,620
No!

1085
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:17,580
I fucked it up!

1086
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:18,840
Ah!

1087
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:19,900
I fucked that up too!

1088
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:22,480
There you go.

1089
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:23,640
I didn't fuck this up.

1090
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:27,000
Yay!

1091
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:30,400
Goodbye.

1092
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:33,780
Wait, he's Keeshan?!

1093
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:36,000
You fucking trash.

1094
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:43,080
If you can be Keeshan, I can be Keeshan too.

1095
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:50,540
That guy was fucking blue.

1096
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:52,380
Imagine losing.

1097
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:56,980
Oh my god.

1098
00:47:57,100 --> 00:47:58,960
I beat all fucking blue.

1099
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:02,500
Embarrassing.

1100
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:04,740
You should uninstall the game, bro.

1101
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:09,960
If your whole life was Tekken 8 and you let that happen to you, you should uninstall.

1102
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:16,880
My OG can't beat this fucking thing.

1103
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:21,300
All I'm saying...

1104
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:22,760
All I'm saying...

1105
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:24,160
I don't know.

1106
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:29,840
I don't know.

1107
00:48:34,310 --> 00:48:35,650
Yeah, beat up blue.

1108
00:48:37,110 --> 00:48:39,470
Stop making me feel cool.

1109
00:48:40,490 --> 00:48:42,470
I should rename my name.

1110
00:48:42,570 --> 00:48:44,590
Doh King uninstalled now.

1111
00:48:48,450 --> 00:48:49,750
Oh no.

1112
00:48:51,530 --> 00:48:55,930
Oh, this is where I get absolutely destroyed by the better King player.

1113
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:07,680
Yeah, I have a feeling he knew about our...

1114
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:09,800
He would know about the fucking...

1115
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:14,260
Wait, what the fuck?

1116
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:16,260
Oh my god.

1117
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:18,260
He's an actual King player!

1118
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:20,780
Boop.

1119
00:49:25,550 --> 00:49:27,610
He should uninstall Tekken now.

1120
00:49:28,230 --> 00:49:29,430
Oh, he did that thing.

1121
00:49:29,490 --> 00:49:30,350
I can do that too.

1122
00:49:31,110 --> 00:49:32,510
Oh, I want to do that.

1123
00:49:32,770 --> 00:49:35,090
Oh, see, I can mirror you.

1124
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:38,250
That was an accident.

1125
00:49:39,170 --> 00:49:40,770
But, oh my god, I Tekked it.

1126
00:49:41,230 --> 00:49:41,690
How?

1127
00:49:42,210 --> 00:49:43,130
Good question.

1128
00:49:43,670 --> 00:49:44,130
Yeah.

1129
00:49:45,830 --> 00:49:46,730
Oh, no.

1130
00:49:46,850 --> 00:49:47,790
I Tekked it too.

1131
00:49:48,550 --> 00:49:50,010
No, I didn't Tek that.

1132
00:49:51,930 --> 00:49:52,450
Boop.

1133
00:49:53,750 --> 00:49:56,650
Bro, this is like the slowest fucking King player ever.

1134
00:49:56,750 --> 00:49:57,530
I swear to god.

1135
00:49:57,630 --> 00:49:58,490
I don't get this.

1136
00:49:58,930 --> 00:49:59,950
I had a feeling.

1137
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:00,350
Yeah.

1138
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:02,770
I swear, this is the slowest...

1139
00:50:02,770 --> 00:50:05,530
I've never seen a King player play this slow.

1140
00:50:09,290 --> 00:50:13,310
It's actually crazy how slow of a King player he is.

1141
00:50:17,410 --> 00:50:19,290
A King player that thinks?

1142
00:50:19,710 --> 00:50:20,650
No way.

1143
00:50:24,790 --> 00:50:25,990
No way.

1144
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:29,710
That's so fucking rare.

1145
00:50:30,310 --> 00:50:32,790
That's actually so rare, man.

1146
00:50:37,610 --> 00:50:39,690
He's doing his part.

1147
00:50:40,570 --> 00:50:41,730
That's what I'm saying.

1148
00:50:41,850 --> 00:50:45,710
I've never fucking seen a King player play this slow before.

1149
00:50:46,130 --> 00:50:46,970
Round four.

1150
00:50:47,790 --> 00:50:48,490
Fight.

1151
00:50:48,490 --> 00:50:53,610
Kings are always so... especially like mirror match kings too.

1152
00:50:53,870 --> 00:50:55,270
I guess like... oh wait no.

1153
00:50:55,490 --> 00:50:57,750
The Kony matchup was so fucking slow.

1154
00:50:59,330 --> 00:50:59,930
Hey!

1155
00:51:02,910 --> 00:51:05,950
To be fair, the Kony matchup with... what's his name?

1156
00:51:06,070 --> 00:51:07,750
G... uh...

1157
00:51:07,750 --> 00:51:10,690
That guy... the other king player that he played?

1158
00:51:11,250 --> 00:51:13,770
That was such a slow king matchup.

1159
00:51:13,770 --> 00:51:14,750
Oh I won!

1160
00:51:15,010 --> 00:51:15,890
I'm the better king.

1161
00:51:16,110 --> 00:51:17,750
You play too slow man.

1162
00:51:21,490 --> 00:51:24,650
You played... yeah, Jinxen yeah yeah.

1163
00:51:26,470 --> 00:51:29,090
You played way too fucking slow.

1164
00:51:35,740 --> 00:51:36,080
Yay!

1165
00:51:41,950 --> 00:51:43,050
Alright, here we go.

1166
00:51:45,870 --> 00:51:49,390
He's almost blue in cat tech shining wizard.

1167
00:51:49,770 --> 00:51:50,210
Hey hey hey hey.

1168
00:51:53,270 --> 00:51:58,750
I swear these purples and blue rings are fucking easier than the red rings.

1169
00:52:01,030 --> 00:52:03,790
I'm gonna say that I'm gonna be absolutely destroyed by these purples.

1170
00:52:06,610 --> 00:52:08,970
Thank you for taking me back to the side!

1171
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:11,910
Oh bro, you duck.

1172
00:52:15,350 --> 00:52:18,890
I'm gonna say that and now I'm gonna get absolutely destroyed by this guy.

1173
00:52:20,670 --> 00:52:21,450
Oh no.

1174
00:52:21,750 --> 00:52:22,910
Oh no, leave me alone!

1175
00:52:23,190 --> 00:52:23,930
Leave me alone!

1176
00:52:24,130 --> 00:52:24,630
Leave me alone!

1177
00:52:27,350 --> 00:52:28,190
Oh, goodbye.

1178
00:52:29,050 --> 00:52:30,970
This guy actually knows what he's doing.

1179
00:52:33,810 --> 00:52:37,350
Oh no, I'm sorry.

1180
00:52:37,510 --> 00:52:38,970
I'm so sorry I didn't mean it.

1181
00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:40,810
Oh he has four wins, he's actually serious.

1182
00:52:41,530 --> 00:52:43,650
Woah, he's actually serious!

1183
00:52:47,370 --> 00:52:48,930
Oh, he ducks everything!

1184
00:52:49,290 --> 00:52:50,530
But you can't duck this!

1185
00:52:52,310 --> 00:52:53,050
Oh god.

1186
00:52:53,210 --> 00:52:53,730
Oh god.

1187
00:52:53,810 --> 00:52:55,050
Nevermind, you don't need a duck.

1188
00:52:55,090 --> 00:52:56,270
You can just beat the shit out of me.

1189
00:52:57,770 --> 00:52:58,210
Understandable.

1190
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:00,450
Understandable.

1191
00:53:02,490 --> 00:53:02,930
Understandable!

1192
00:53:07,110 --> 00:53:08,310
Oh shit, okay.

1193
00:53:08,710 --> 00:53:09,150
Understandable.

1194
00:53:09,270 --> 00:53:09,710
Understandable.

1195
00:53:09,730 --> 00:53:11,210
You hate... you hate tigers.

1196
00:53:11,330 --> 00:53:12,090
You hate Jaguars.

1197
00:53:13,650 --> 00:53:15,850
You hate... you hate...

1198
00:53:15,850 --> 00:53:16,590
You hate...

1199
00:53:16,590 --> 00:53:16,590
you hate...

1200
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:20,100
Oh shit.

1201
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:21,560
Oh, goodbye.

1202
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:23,560
I guess I'll go to the moon now.

1203
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:25,440
My people need me.

1204
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:31,980
Oh, he fucking went first!

1205
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:34,100
I'm sorry.

1206
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:35,040
I'm so sorry.

1207
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:36,680
I'm so sorry.

1208
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:38,800
This is my sorry punch.

1209
00:53:39,260 --> 00:53:40,440
I'm so sorry.

1210
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:42,160
I didn't mean to.

1211
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:42,980
Oh shit.

1212
00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:43,540
No.

1213
00:53:43,660 --> 00:53:44,660
I'm so sorry.

1214
00:53:44,740 --> 00:53:45,800
Please, have mercy.

1215
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:50,180
Okay.

1216
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:55,460
Okay, but will he expect this?

1217
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:56,440
Oh my god!

1218
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:57,820
Who are you?

1219
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:02,960
Does he tech it?

1220
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:03,840
No, he doesn't.

1221
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:10,680
Oh.

1222
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:11,880
No, I've messed up.

1223
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:12,660
Messed it up.

1224
00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:16,440
Boom!

1225
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:16,860
Boom!

1226
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:21,200
JK.

1227
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:22,900
You're right.

1228
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:23,560
Maybe not again.

1229
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:24,100
You're right.

1230
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:24,520
You're right.

1231
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:25,080
Maybe not.

1232
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:26,080
Maybe not.

1233
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:27,700
Can I please... Can I please get up?

1234
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:28,180
Please, sir.

1235
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:28,860
Please.

1236
00:54:29,380 --> 00:54:29,860
Please.

1237
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:30,480
Please.

1238
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:30,980
Please.

1239
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:32,200
Ah!

1240
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:40,980
I deserve that.

1241
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:44,460
I'm sorry for doing the 500 shining wizards.

1242
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:45,980
I'm so sorry.

1243
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:50,000
Oh my god.

1244
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:57,740
I'm so... I'm sorry for all the shining wizards.

1245
00:54:57,760 --> 00:54:59,040
I didn't mean to.

1246
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:02,460
I'm so sorry.

1247
00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:07,920
It's my bad.

1248
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:10,780
I got cocky.

1249
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:18,480
I got so cocky.

1250
00:55:21,580 --> 00:55:22,020
Yeah.

1251
00:55:23,380 --> 00:55:24,400
I got humbled.

1252
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:28,900
I mean, there's a reason why my block is at 30.

1253
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:31,320
Okay, I'm gonna block in this one.

1254
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:34,980
Alright.

1255
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:36,340
I'm gonna block on this one.

1256
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:40,520
Oh no.

1257
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:42,240
She's a fast one too.

1258
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:43,740
They always have that ghost.

1259
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:50,120
How do you guys register the fact that I don't block lows?

1260
00:55:51,820 --> 00:55:53,920
I guess when you abuse ally kickstats, that's when you know.

1261
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:56,360
Oh.

1262
00:55:57,420 --> 00:55:58,020
Oh.

1263
00:55:58,100 --> 00:56:01,420
No, I even fucking... I even tried to block.

1264
00:56:01,660 --> 00:56:04,180
I was actually trying to block.

1265
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:06,260
What?

1266
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:09,160
No!

1267
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:13,100
My chat told me to try blocking!

1268
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:16,340
And I always knew that was a mistake!

1269
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:17,820
.

1270
00:56:17,820 --> 00:56:18,320
.

1271
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:25,100
I'll never block again.

1272
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:27,540
My chat was fucking wrong.

1273
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:28,960
.

1274
00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:36,920
Oh my god.

1275
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:39,740
I think the issue is that I don't know what move is what.

1276
00:56:40,420 --> 00:56:42,280
What is low and what isn't.

1277
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:44,040
That's definitely my issue.

1278
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:44,840
.

1279
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:46,280
Oh,

1280
00:56:51,100 --> 00:56:52,120
she doesn't block that though.

1281
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:52,720
.

1282
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:56,580
Does she do it again?

1283
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:57,360
Okay.

1284
00:57:00,140 --> 00:57:00,620
.

1285
00:57:00,620 --> 00:57:00,740
.

1286
00:57:00,740 --> 00:57:01,540
.

1287
00:57:01,540 --> 00:57:01,760
.

1288
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:02,340
.

1289
00:57:02,340 --> 00:57:02,380
.

1290
00:57:06,970 --> 00:57:07,450
.

1291
00:57:07,450 --> 00:57:07,610
.

1292
00:57:07,610 --> 00:57:07,650
.

1293
00:57:09,750 --> 00:57:10,230
.

1294
00:57:10,230 --> 00:57:10,290
.

1295
00:57:10,290 --> 00:57:10,750
I'm gonna go get my nipples.

1296
00:57:11,030 --> 00:57:11,370
.

1297
00:57:11,370 --> 00:57:12,090
.

1298
00:57:12,090 --> 00:57:12,790
.

1299
00:57:12,790 --> 00:57:12,850
.

1300
00:57:12,850 --> 00:57:13,070
.

1301
00:57:13,070 --> 00:57:13,310
.

1302
00:57:13,310 --> 00:57:13,670
.

1303
00:57:13,670 --> 00:57:14,010
.

1304
00:57:16,650 --> 00:57:17,270
.

1305
00:57:17,270 --> 00:57:17,390
.

1306
00:57:17,390 --> 00:57:17,510
.

1307
00:57:18,330 --> 00:57:18,950
.

1308
00:57:18,950 --> 00:57:18,970
.

1309
00:57:19,850 --> 00:57:26,870
I'm gonna go get my nipples.

1310
00:57:26,890 --> 00:57:26,910
.

1311
00:57:27,690 --> 00:57:28,330
.

1312
00:57:28,330 --> 00:57:29,330
.

1313
00:57:29,330 --> 00:57:30,030
.

1314
00:57:30,030 --> 00:57:30,110
.

1315
00:57:30,110 --> 00:57:30,270
.

1316
00:57:30,270 --> 00:57:30,350
.

1317
00:57:30,350 --> 00:57:30,930
.

1318
00:57:30,930 --> 00:57:31,190
.

1319
00:57:31,190 --> 00:57:38,690
I'm gonna go get my nipples.

1320
00:57:38,690 --> 00:57:39,390
.

1321
00:57:39,390 --> 00:57:39,950
.

1322
00:57:39,950 --> 00:57:40,470
.

1323
00:57:40,470 --> 00:57:40,670
.

1324
00:57:40,670 --> 00:57:41,050
.

1325
00:57:41,050 --> 00:57:41,170
.

1326
00:57:41,170 --> 00:57:41,290
.

1327
00:57:41,290 --> 00:57:41,330
.

1328
00:57:41,330 --> 00:57:43,270
.

1329
00:57:43,270 --> 00:57:44,030
.

1330
00:57:44,030 --> 00:57:46,010
.

1331
00:57:46,010 --> 00:57:46,070
.

1332
00:57:46,070 --> 00:57:46,090
.

1333
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:50,210
.

1334
00:57:50,210 --> 00:57:50,970
Oh, don't forget everything.

1335
00:57:54,910 --> 00:57:55,470
No...

1336
00:57:55,470 --> 00:57:56,010
Nice.

1337
00:57:56,790 --> 00:57:58,650
I take that one point off the purple.

1338
00:57:58,770 --> 00:57:59,690
You are a purple?!

1339
00:57:59,690 --> 00:58:00,050
.

1340
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:08,700
That's embarrassing for you.

1341
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:09,660
.

1342
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:19,220
That's so embarrassing, you should be blocking that.

1343
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:19,860
You're a purple.

1344
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:21,560
.

1345
00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:26,270
Okay.

1346
00:58:27,290 --> 00:58:28,690
Alright, I'm sorry...

1347
00:58:28,690 --> 00:58:30,210
...but you should be blocking that.

1348
00:58:30,330 --> 00:58:30,610
.

1349
00:58:30,610 --> 00:58:31,110
.

1350
00:58:31,110 --> 00:58:31,110
...but you should be blocking that.

1351
00:58:31,110 --> 00:58:31,110
.

1352
00:58:34,770 --> 00:58:36,790
This is gonna be close, dude.

1353
00:58:38,270 --> 00:58:39,090
Oh no.

1354
00:58:39,810 --> 00:58:42,210
No, I swear I was at a low.

1355
00:58:42,750 --> 00:58:45,530
I'm sorry, I'm sorry for making fun of you, I'm so sorry!

1356
00:58:45,910 --> 00:58:46,390
I'm not!

1357
00:58:54,670 --> 00:58:55,190
No.

1358
00:58:57,370 --> 00:58:58,710
Okay, I'll take those.

1359
00:59:00,690 --> 00:59:01,170
Oh!

1360
00:59:01,170 --> 00:59:03,630
It's okay, I took two rounds off of fucking purple.

1361
00:59:04,350 --> 00:59:05,310
E-rank now.

1362
00:59:05,850 --> 00:59:07,270
You should be in my elo.

1363
00:59:10,790 --> 00:59:14,250
You should be in my elo for making that too close.

1364
00:59:20,130 --> 00:59:20,610
Wow!

1365
00:59:26,470 --> 00:59:28,370
That's some fucking bullshit right now.

1366
00:59:31,670 --> 00:59:33,030
Yeah, that was way too close.

1367
00:59:34,270 --> 00:59:35,130
Yeah, like what?

1368
00:59:35,230 --> 00:59:36,270
I actually have 50 hours.

1369
00:59:38,350 --> 00:59:40,250
I was looking at how many hours I have.

1370
00:59:40,310 --> 00:59:41,710
I have 50-ish hours.

1371
00:59:47,130 --> 00:59:48,590
Yeah, I have very weak defense.

1372
00:59:48,730 --> 00:59:49,770
The thing is...

1373
00:59:49,770 --> 00:59:53,790
A lot of the characters I'm playing... like a lot of the people I'm playing against...

1374
00:59:53,790 --> 00:59:57,950
Like, the worst part is like... it's cause they're like such uncommon characters in ranked.

1375
00:59:58,070 --> 01:00:00,610
So I barely play against these...

1376
01:00:00,750 --> 01:00:01,430
Types of characters.

1377
01:00:01,890 --> 01:00:03,750
I think that's like the worst part.

1378
01:00:04,270 --> 01:00:04,810
Honestly.

1379
01:00:05,910 --> 01:00:06,930
Oh hey, it's Leon.

1380
01:00:11,050 --> 01:00:12,550
Cause like I fucking...

1381
01:00:12,550 --> 01:00:13,870
I saw like fucking...

1382
01:00:13,870 --> 01:00:17,470
My entire time in those 50 hours getting to this elo...

1383
01:00:17,470 --> 01:00:19,410
Like all the fucking ranks I...

1384
01:00:19,410 --> 01:00:20,330
Like you know from...

1385
01:00:20,330 --> 01:00:22,510
From beginner to red...

1386
01:00:22,510 --> 01:00:24,630
I saw three Yoshis.

1387
01:00:27,350 --> 01:00:30,610
I saw only three Yoshis.

1388
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:32,630
But I saw fucking 200 fucking...

1389
01:00:34,370 --> 01:00:35,350
Reinas though.

1390
01:00:39,310 --> 01:00:41,290
Like that's the worst part.

1391
01:00:41,690 --> 01:00:41,870
Like that's the worst part.

1392
01:00:45,420 --> 01:00:46,180
Like that's the worst part.

1393
01:00:46,220 --> 01:00:47,860
Kings were also pretty rare.

1394
01:00:48,020 --> 01:00:49,280
I think kings were like...

1395
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:50,780
I think I've seen like...

1396
01:00:50,780 --> 01:00:52,240
Maybe like in ranked?

1397
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:53,940
Maybe like...

1398
01:00:53,940 --> 01:00:54,740
Uh...

1399
01:00:56,780 --> 01:00:57,660
Oh Chester.

1400
01:00:57,800 --> 01:00:58,040
Okay.

1401
01:00:58,420 --> 01:00:59,300
I'm trying to like think.

1402
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:01,360
I think I've seen like maybe like...

1403
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:02,820
8 king players?

1404
01:01:03,020 --> 01:01:03,300
10?

1405
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:04,340
I think 10.

1406
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:05,400
10 king players.

1407
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:07,920
Can you show us up more later on?

1408
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:08,320
Yeah.

1409
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:09,540
I fucking see like...

1410
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:10,740
200 Reinas.

1411
01:01:11,420 --> 01:01:12,300
200 Reinas?

1412
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:13,740
Uh...

1413
01:01:13,740 --> 01:01:15,540
Who else do I see a lot?

1414
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:17,440
I see a lot of Alyssas too.

1415
01:01:23,670 --> 01:01:24,110
Okay.

1416
01:01:24,110 --> 01:01:25,370
Oh I fucked up the...

1417
01:01:25,370 --> 01:01:26,330
I fucked that up.

1418
01:01:27,130 --> 01:01:27,690
I can do it again.

1419
01:01:28,490 --> 01:01:29,290
There you go.

1420
01:01:31,350 --> 01:01:32,430
I'm like fucked it up.

1421
01:01:32,470 --> 01:01:34,870
I got blue 3 back.

1422
01:01:36,290 --> 01:01:37,130
I'm warmed up.

1423
01:01:38,030 --> 01:01:40,450
The kings and the Yoshis are in the high ranks?

1424
01:01:40,690 --> 01:01:41,330
The kings and the Yoshis are in the high ranks?

1425
01:01:41,330 --> 01:01:43,550
Yeah but it sucks because I don't get a chance to practice.

1426
01:01:45,210 --> 01:01:47,510
I still have Azus too.

1427
01:01:47,750 --> 01:01:48,210
I'm feeling solid.

1428
01:01:48,530 --> 01:01:51,550
I'm feeling like let's just fucking play some video games.

1429
01:01:51,710 --> 01:01:52,950
Let's play some video games.

1430
01:01:53,470 --> 01:01:54,030
That's it.

1431
01:01:54,730 --> 01:01:56,190
Take me back to the other side.

1432
01:01:57,130 --> 01:01:57,590
I think we have to do.

1433
01:01:57,870 --> 01:01:58,390
Nice.

1434
01:01:59,470 --> 01:01:59,990
Yeah.

1435
01:02:01,630 --> 01:02:03,130
Oh wait you fucking rose?

1436
01:02:03,430 --> 01:02:04,870
Oh this guy knows how to play against kings.

1437
01:02:06,250 --> 01:02:08,390
This guy knows how to play against kings.

1438
01:02:08,530 --> 01:02:09,110
Holy shit.

1439
01:02:11,570 --> 01:02:13,030
He actually rose.

1440
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:19,120
Yeah.

1441
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:20,400
Goodbye.

1442
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:23,000
I need to use the bathroom.

1443
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:24,320
I'll be right back chat.

1444
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:26,060
You win.

1445
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:28,740
I'll be right back.

1446
01:02:28,860 --> 01:02:29,960
I need to use the bathroom.

1447
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:34,860
You just get to see King and Yoshi.

1448
01:02:36,060 --> 01:02:37,340
You're standing there.

1449
01:02:38,020 --> 01:02:38,740
You're standing there.

1450
01:02:38,740 --> 01:02:42,220
Well he almost knows how to play against kings.

1451
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:43,500
Well he almost knows how to play against kings.

1452
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:44,200
Not that.

1453
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:44,840
What was it?

1454
01:02:45,100 --> 01:02:45,960
Matching settings.

1455
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:48,160
I'll be back guys.

1456
01:04:39,190 --> 01:04:39,830
Alright.

1457
01:04:41,110 --> 01:04:41,950
Who's here?

1458
01:04:43,110 --> 01:04:43,650
What's up?

1459
01:04:45,490 --> 01:04:46,870
We're fighting team NYK.

1460
01:04:47,210 --> 01:04:49,630
They had to do a coach match tiebreaker for it.

1461
01:04:49,950 --> 01:04:50,370
Yup.

1462
01:04:50,770 --> 01:04:51,470
That's a five?

1463
01:04:52,290 --> 01:04:52,710
No.

1464
01:04:54,130 --> 01:04:54,790
That's crazy.

1465
01:04:55,210 --> 01:04:56,550
I was saying you guys watching this right?

1466
01:04:56,850 --> 01:04:58,390
I'm back.

1467
01:04:58,750 --> 01:05:00,210
I wasn't watching the lily mirror.

1468
01:05:02,590 --> 01:05:04,730
He had like crazy scaling.

1469
01:05:04,810 --> 01:05:07,250
So it looked like he was going to have to win one more interaction.

1470
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:09,270
And then he got like a wall reset.

1471
01:05:09,910 --> 01:05:12,090
And he just blew her up with one move.

1472
01:05:12,090 --> 01:05:13,210
I don't know what it was.

1473
01:05:13,290 --> 01:05:14,750
Oh he was in heat?

1474
01:05:14,830 --> 01:05:17,370
Was it like the mid where she spins in the air and shit?

1475
01:05:17,490 --> 01:05:18,970
I don't think so.

1476
01:05:19,230 --> 01:05:21,570
It looked like a hole punch.

1477
01:05:22,010 --> 01:05:24,130
Someone linked it.

1478
01:05:24,310 --> 01:05:25,110
I'm watching it.

1479
01:05:26,550 --> 01:05:29,470
I was like okay so the scaling means he can't get the kill here.

1480
01:05:29,630 --> 01:05:31,110
And then he like bounced off wall.

1481
01:05:31,250 --> 01:05:31,850
I was like oh okay.

1482
01:05:32,350 --> 01:05:34,490
It's like 19 I think.

1483
01:05:34,510 --> 01:05:36,130
Holy shit he came back like this?

1484
01:05:36,510 --> 01:05:37,090
Yeah dude.

1485
01:05:37,750 --> 01:05:38,990
Alright do your thing.

1486
01:05:38,990 --> 01:05:40,430
Do your thing.

1487
01:05:41,150 --> 01:05:42,090
Do your thing.

1488
01:05:42,430 --> 01:05:43,530
Another hope kick?

1489
01:05:44,550 --> 01:05:45,330
Oh no.

1490
01:05:47,390 --> 01:05:47,870
No.

1491
01:05:49,310 --> 01:05:50,770
Oh what the hell.

1492
01:05:51,290 --> 01:05:52,990
Miles got up incorrectly there.

1493
01:05:52,990 --> 01:05:53,970
She could have teched but.

1494
01:05:54,230 --> 01:05:54,910
That's what that was?

1495
01:05:56,950 --> 01:05:57,850
That's not guaranteed.

1496
01:05:57,990 --> 01:05:58,650
Let me see it again.

1497
01:05:59,130 --> 01:06:00,790
Yeah she could have teched right there.

1498
01:06:03,430 --> 01:06:03,910
Okay.

1499
01:06:04,010 --> 01:06:04,710
She could have got up.

1500
01:06:06,830 --> 01:06:07,590
I think.

1501
01:06:08,990 --> 01:06:10,270
This game is still kind of new.

1502
01:06:10,550 --> 01:06:12,310
I'm watching on the Sage Jam thing too.

1503
01:06:12,810 --> 01:06:13,710
Hits against wall.

1504
01:06:16,490 --> 01:06:17,410
That's so weird.

1505
01:06:17,630 --> 01:06:18,410
What a weird situation.

1506
01:06:18,670 --> 01:06:21,230
Yeah maybe it was guaranteed.

1507
01:06:21,430 --> 01:06:21,870
I'm not sure.

1508
01:06:22,350 --> 01:06:22,750
Ugh.

1509
01:06:24,210 --> 01:06:25,370
You can hold back.

1510
01:06:25,630 --> 01:06:27,310
I think if she teched she could have got out of it.

1511
01:06:30,190 --> 01:06:30,590
Alright.

1512
01:06:30,990 --> 01:06:31,590
Um yeah.

1513
01:06:31,750 --> 01:06:33,370
The teams are playing kind of crazy.

1514
01:06:34,710 --> 01:06:35,790
I mean I believe in you guys.

1515
01:06:36,570 --> 01:06:37,550
So am I.

1516
01:06:38,990 --> 01:06:39,790
You are also.

1517
01:06:39,930 --> 01:06:41,790
You didn't play with us yesterday.

1518
01:06:42,170 --> 01:06:43,490
We had a big session.

1519
01:06:43,950 --> 01:06:47,590
I had to fucking clock in for my other job.

1520
01:06:48,570 --> 01:06:49,950
What a sad day.

1521
01:06:50,110 --> 01:06:51,090
I feel good.

1522
01:06:51,150 --> 01:06:51,530
I feel good.

1523
01:06:52,130 --> 01:06:53,210
I just got up.

1524
01:06:53,270 --> 01:06:54,750
I ranked up again just now.

1525
01:06:55,810 --> 01:06:57,690
Everything is fucking nice man.

1526
01:06:58,010 --> 01:06:59,210
Big Raijin.

1527
01:06:59,990 --> 01:07:01,230
I'm a big Raijin.

1528
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:01,750
Gaming.

1529
01:07:02,210 --> 01:07:03,130
It was good.

1530
01:07:03,230 --> 01:07:05,350
You kept Josh from practicing though.

1531
01:07:05,370 --> 01:07:05,750
That was good.

1532
01:07:05,750 --> 01:07:06,910
I actually did.

1533
01:07:06,990 --> 01:07:07,370
I know.

1534
01:07:10,230 --> 01:07:11,030
Makes sense.

1535
01:07:11,210 --> 01:07:12,590
He needed to talk about me.

1536
01:07:13,770 --> 01:07:16,310
I mean you also kept me from practicing too.

1537
01:07:16,470 --> 01:07:17,250
I'm not gonna lie.

1538
01:07:17,410 --> 01:07:18,290
That's not my fault.

1539
01:07:18,410 --> 01:07:20,330
You watching my stream is not my fault.

1540
01:07:20,330 --> 01:07:20,790
It is your fault.

1541
01:07:20,930 --> 01:07:21,510
You guys.

1542
01:07:21,570 --> 01:07:23,010
I'm like I gotta go practice.

1543
01:07:23,090 --> 01:07:24,390
And you're like practice?

1544
01:07:25,030 --> 01:07:26,710
You pay your editor in Tripoli.

1545
01:07:27,850 --> 01:07:29,630
Guys what's the move set for it?

1546
01:07:29,810 --> 01:07:30,070
So there.

1547
01:07:33,930 --> 01:07:34,430
What's the.

1548
01:07:34,430 --> 01:07:36,030
Do you guys know the move set for it?

1549
01:07:36,230 --> 01:07:36,390
Oh.

1550
01:07:36,750 --> 01:07:37,610
I'm Kishin.

1551
01:07:37,870 --> 01:07:38,450
Oh no.

1552
01:07:38,750 --> 01:07:39,570
Kishin cousin.

1553
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:41,470
It's fine.

1554
01:07:41,590 --> 01:07:43,090
Do you even wanna go to Evo?

1555
01:07:44,890 --> 01:07:45,310
Who?

1556
01:07:45,370 --> 01:07:45,610
Me?

1557
01:07:48,330 --> 01:07:49,170
Oh Dokie.

1558
01:07:49,310 --> 01:07:49,690
Yeah!

1559
01:07:50,470 --> 01:07:51,030
You do?

1560
01:07:51,230 --> 01:07:51,530
Okay.

1561
01:07:51,770 --> 01:07:52,190
Yeah!

1562
01:07:52,370 --> 01:07:53,650
So you guys better win.

1563
01:07:53,950 --> 01:07:54,430
Her ass is not going to Evo.

1564
01:07:55,730 --> 01:07:56,150
What?

1565
01:07:56,710 --> 01:07:58,150
What's the best way?

1566
01:07:58,630 --> 01:07:59,650
I don't know how you do it.

1567
01:07:59,710 --> 01:08:00,650
Is it like a super chat?

1568
01:08:01,910 --> 01:08:04,090
No I want free tickets here.

1569
01:08:04,650 --> 01:08:05,130
Yeah.

1570
01:08:05,250 --> 01:08:06,430
It's not as good.

1571
01:08:06,730 --> 01:08:09,310
Paying your own ticket is not as good as a free ticket.

1572
01:08:09,630 --> 01:08:10,370
It's true.

1573
01:08:10,590 --> 01:08:10,890
Yeah.

1574
01:08:13,190 --> 01:08:15,950
Getting comped from Seijin like it's the fucking Aria.

1575
01:08:16,250 --> 01:08:16,490
Mm.

1576
01:08:18,390 --> 01:08:20,670
Run me my $40 spare flight.

1577
01:08:20,850 --> 01:08:21,530
Run me that shit.

1578
01:08:21,530 --> 01:08:21,530
Yeah.

1579
01:08:21,530 --> 01:08:21,650
Wait.

1580
01:08:21,770 --> 01:08:23,790
Are they actually paying for plane tickets too?

1581
01:08:24,630 --> 01:08:25,110
Yeah.

1582
01:08:25,310 --> 01:08:26,090
Oh wait.

1583
01:08:26,170 --> 01:08:26,650
And hotels?

1584
01:08:27,330 --> 01:08:27,810
Yeah.

1585
01:08:27,950 --> 01:08:28,290
Yeah.

1586
01:08:28,290 --> 01:08:28,750
What the fuck?

1587
01:08:28,770 --> 01:08:29,630
Win this for me.

1588
01:08:30,050 --> 01:08:30,870
Run me my.

1589
01:08:32,130 --> 01:08:32,970
We're trapped.

1590
01:08:34,430 --> 01:08:35,670
I'm trying to run you your middle seat.

1591
01:08:35,770 --> 01:08:36,650
That you deserve.

1592
01:08:37,530 --> 01:08:38,870
I deserve this.

1593
01:08:41,190 --> 01:08:42,510
I love free stuff.

1594
01:08:52,730 --> 01:08:55,850
I'm seeing a lot of discourse on the timeline about throwing chairs.

1595
01:08:56,970 --> 01:08:57,710
Dude he...

1596
01:08:57,710 --> 01:09:00,050
It was a big throw.

1597
01:09:00,350 --> 01:09:01,290
I saw it.

1598
01:09:01,350 --> 01:09:02,550
I thought he broke the stage.

1599
01:09:02,670 --> 01:09:04,250
Because it was all folded and shit.

1600
01:09:04,490 --> 01:09:05,710
But apparently it was like that.

1601
01:09:05,730 --> 01:09:07,810
Are we supposed to get on the...

1602
01:09:07,810 --> 01:09:10,510
Get on to the room now or no?

1603
01:09:10,510 --> 01:09:10,770
Yeah.

1604
01:09:11,190 --> 01:09:13,630
They're making a lobby in a second.

1605
01:09:13,750 --> 01:09:14,310
I'm gonna go pee.

1606
01:09:14,390 --> 01:09:14,790
Alright.

1607
01:09:18,450 --> 01:09:21,770
He's like I'm ripping off this shirt if I lose a round.

1608
01:09:21,890 --> 01:09:24,610
Our friendship of 8 years will be over for this match.

1609
01:09:25,450 --> 01:09:26,390
It was time.

1610
01:09:27,130 --> 01:09:28,930
It was a timer and this was it.

1611
01:09:30,870 --> 01:09:32,590
Yo he fucked that chair up dude.

1612
01:09:32,690 --> 01:09:33,250
Oh my god.

1613
01:09:33,450 --> 01:09:34,510
I know dude.

1614
01:09:37,590 --> 01:09:38,810
It ran its course.

1615
01:09:38,870 --> 01:09:40,010
It's time to end it.

1616
01:09:40,110 --> 01:09:40,490
I'm gonna go pee.

1617
01:09:40,510 --> 01:09:41,710
On Tekken 8.

1618
01:09:46,830 --> 01:09:47,310
Ohhhhh.

1619
01:09:48,210 --> 01:09:50,170
I've never felt so nervous before.

1620
01:09:50,590 --> 01:09:51,450
I know right.

1621
01:09:51,530 --> 01:09:52,970
Like why is this so weird.

1622
01:09:52,970 --> 01:09:53,390
Yeah.

1623
01:09:54,850 --> 01:09:57,550
Wait Doki you said you've never been this nervous before?

1624
01:09:57,830 --> 01:09:59,650
No I've never been this nervous before.

1625
01:09:59,890 --> 01:10:00,710
Never in your life?

1626
01:10:00,810 --> 01:10:02,710
No one has ever felt that way.

1627
01:10:02,790 --> 01:10:04,010
That feel right now.

1628
01:10:05,710 --> 01:10:06,430
It's true.

1629
01:10:06,730 --> 01:10:07,470
It's true.

1630
01:10:07,670 --> 01:10:09,530
Science needs to study this new feeling.

1631
01:10:09,650 --> 01:10:10,670
Yeah this new feeling.

1632
01:10:10,810 --> 01:10:11,790
What is this feeling?

1633
01:10:13,070 --> 01:10:16,210
Dude this Stajam Slam is pretty stressful yeah.

1634
01:10:16,270 --> 01:10:20,390
I mean it's like really good and really bad all together.

1635
01:10:20,630 --> 01:10:21,890
Like a rollercoaster.

1636
01:10:22,150 --> 01:10:22,730
Like a rollercoaster.

1637
01:10:22,730 --> 01:10:23,470
Like a rollercoaster.

1638
01:10:23,470 --> 01:10:26,010
Hey we'd be feeling much worse if we didn't all have trips.

1639
01:10:26,190 --> 01:10:27,730
Obviously we want to get her a trip.

1640
01:10:27,790 --> 01:10:28,390
You know what I'm saying?

1641
01:10:28,410 --> 01:10:31,350
Yeah you guys should feel particularly bad if I don't get a trip.

1642
01:10:32,330 --> 01:10:32,850
Yeah you guys should feel particularly bad if I don't get a trip.

1643
01:10:33,150 --> 01:10:33,570
Yeah.

1644
01:10:36,370 --> 01:10:38,990
Stajam's praying for us to win so he doesn't have to double up.

1645
01:10:39,230 --> 01:10:39,430
Stajam's praying for us to win so he doesn't have to double up.

1646
01:10:39,450 --> 01:10:40,370
He should give...

1647
01:10:40,370 --> 01:10:42,950
I told him he should give like you guys like a budget.

1648
01:10:43,050 --> 01:10:45,110
The equivalent to the evo ticket.

1649
01:10:45,450 --> 01:10:45,750
A per diem.

1650
01:10:45,750 --> 01:10:47,070
Dude wait a minute.

1651
01:10:47,630 --> 01:10:50,790
That's kind of... yeah give us 500 for the tables.

1652
01:10:50,930 --> 01:10:51,410
Yeah.

1653
01:10:51,950 --> 01:10:52,430
Exactly.

1654
01:10:54,890 --> 01:10:56,710
I mean how much is it?

1655
01:10:56,730 --> 01:10:58,810
How much is like hotel, flight, and ticket?

1656
01:10:58,990 --> 01:10:59,790
Add that all together.

1657
01:10:59,870 --> 01:11:00,850
Each of us gets a budget.

1658
01:11:02,130 --> 01:11:03,530
Yeah we get a per diem.

1659
01:11:03,530 --> 01:11:05,630
A lobster dinner every night.

1660
01:11:05,970 --> 01:11:07,270
Oh true true true.

1661
01:11:07,270 --> 01:11:08,130
That shit ain't sweet dude.

1662
01:11:08,310 --> 01:11:10,570
The hotel room has to be an up...

1663
01:11:10,570 --> 01:11:14,790
If you guys win we should upgrade our hotel rooms to a suite.

1664
01:11:15,170 --> 01:11:15,830
Oh yeah.

1665
01:11:15,990 --> 01:11:19,250
I want the heart tub and I want a captain's hat.

1666
01:11:19,250 --> 01:11:20,090
The heart tub?

1667
01:11:20,630 --> 01:11:23,250
I'll get in the heart tub with the champagne glass.

1668
01:11:24,750 --> 01:11:31,540
Oh shit this is the S's ain't enough.

1669
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:32,780
We're in.

1670
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:37,960
Now we're drawing right after this match.

1671
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:41,640
Oh.

1672
01:11:46,870 --> 01:11:48,710
I've never been this stressed before.

1673
01:11:49,270 --> 01:11:49,950
I know.

1674
01:11:51,250 --> 01:11:51,730
Scary.

1675
01:11:52,310 --> 01:11:54,430
The first one was really bad too.

1676
01:11:54,970 --> 01:11:55,990
It's okay though.

1677
01:11:56,530 --> 01:11:57,290
It's fun though.

1678
01:11:58,450 --> 01:12:02,270
Yeah and we'll do a little food drive donation drive thing for you.

1679
01:12:02,350 --> 01:12:02,750
Okay.

1680
01:12:02,790 --> 01:12:03,650
Alright guys.

1681
01:12:03,870 --> 01:12:06,650
If I lose this it's because of my coach.

1682
01:12:07,070 --> 01:12:10,850
Yeah the box in front of the grocery store will put like canned pumpkin in there.

1683
01:12:11,050 --> 01:12:11,530
Yeah.

1684
01:12:11,530 --> 01:12:12,570
And I don't get to eat it either.

1685
01:12:13,630 --> 01:12:15,930
My coach just didn't coach me hard enough.

1686
01:12:16,130 --> 01:12:16,850
It's his fault.

1687
01:12:18,010 --> 01:12:19,090
It's not my fault.

1688
01:12:19,410 --> 01:12:19,830
He's a king player too.

1689
01:12:20,130 --> 01:12:20,930
Yeah I know.

1690
01:12:21,030 --> 01:12:22,070
That's like the worst part.

1691
01:12:22,210 --> 01:12:24,310
A king player couldn't fucking help me.

1692
01:12:25,130 --> 01:12:26,390
Oh he deafened himself.

1693
01:12:26,550 --> 01:12:27,090
He doesn't want to.

1694
01:12:28,050 --> 01:12:28,730
He did.

1695
01:12:29,470 --> 01:12:30,630
His ass is just trying to hear that.

1696
01:12:30,990 --> 01:12:31,490
Not today.

1697
01:12:31,790 --> 01:12:32,970
Not today.

1698
01:12:42,210 --> 01:12:44,270
100% blaming the coach on this.

1699
01:12:46,450 --> 01:12:47,190
Oh my god.

1700
01:12:47,270 --> 01:12:48,630
He's just gonna beat me up guys.

1701
01:12:49,530 --> 01:12:51,030
Just remember the spinny shit.

1702
01:12:51,930 --> 01:12:52,910
I'm gonna try.

1703
01:12:53,670 --> 01:12:54,410
You got it.

1704
01:12:54,470 --> 01:12:54,790
You got it.

1705
01:12:54,950 --> 01:12:55,930
We believe in you.

1706
01:12:56,050 --> 01:12:59,510
Oh shit.

1707
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:12,840
Oh what?

1708
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:15,480
Yes.

1709
01:13:15,480 --> 01:13:15,880
Yes.

1710
01:13:16,160 --> 01:13:16,880
Good stuff.

1711
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:20,480
Nice.

1712
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:21,220
I'm coming.

1713
01:13:21,540 --> 01:13:22,720
Oh god.

1714
01:13:22,900 --> 01:13:23,660
She's doing that thing.

1715
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:27,280
Okay.

1716
01:13:27,720 --> 01:13:28,240
Okay.

1717
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:28,800
Full screen reset.

1718
01:13:30,260 --> 01:13:31,500
She's doing that thing.

1719
01:13:32,260 --> 01:13:33,500
The spinny thing.

1720
01:13:34,020 --> 01:13:34,540
Okay.

1721
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:35,460
I die here.

1722
01:13:38,740 --> 01:13:39,340
It's alright.

1723
01:13:39,900 --> 01:13:41,200
Just one round.

1724
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:42,500
We lock in.

1725
01:13:43,580 --> 01:13:44,620
Good shit.

1726
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:45,920
Let's fucking go.

1727
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:47,820
Yeah but it didn't register.

1728
01:13:48,280 --> 01:13:48,820
It's okay.

1729
01:13:49,020 --> 01:13:50,020
As long as you're not getting hit.

1730
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:54,160
Oh shit.

1731
01:13:54,180 --> 01:13:54,580
She like...

1732
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:56,800
Yes.

1733
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:57,540
Good shit.

1734
01:13:57,680 --> 01:13:59,540
Yeah it doesn't matter if you're not punishing.

1735
01:13:59,680 --> 01:14:01,160
As long as you're blocking and not taking damage.

1736
01:14:02,380 --> 01:14:03,480
Oh my god.

1737
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:05,360
Don't tell me.

1738
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:12,640
Yup.

1739
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:13,600
I love the delay.

1740
01:14:13,900 --> 01:14:15,240
Oh my god you're a genius.

1741
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:15,800
Okay.

1742
01:14:18,920 --> 01:14:19,400
Okay.

1743
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:20,360
Good stuff.

1744
01:14:23,810 --> 01:14:24,910
Is this it?

1745
01:14:25,330 --> 01:14:25,810
Nice.

1746
01:14:25,810 --> 01:14:26,090
That's it.

1747
01:14:26,790 --> 01:14:27,270
Genius.

1748
01:14:28,790 --> 01:14:29,370
Good job.

1749
01:14:29,430 --> 01:14:30,030
That was sick.

1750
01:14:30,350 --> 01:14:30,750
Yup.

1751
01:14:32,030 --> 01:14:32,830
Good shit.

1752
01:14:33,890 --> 01:14:34,950
That's a round in the bank.

1753
01:14:36,430 --> 01:14:38,070
You probably can hit that every round.

1754
01:14:38,190 --> 01:14:39,590
Because Goomy's not respecting it.

1755
01:14:40,090 --> 01:14:41,330
Yeah just fucking rip it.

1756
01:14:42,930 --> 01:14:43,330
Okay.

1757
01:14:43,690 --> 01:14:44,090
Nice.

1758
01:14:46,090 --> 01:14:46,750
Good shit.

1759
01:14:48,270 --> 01:14:48,810
It's cool.

1760
01:14:48,950 --> 01:14:49,650
Oh good check.

1761
01:14:49,790 --> 01:14:50,630
I love the dick jab.

1762
01:14:50,810 --> 01:14:51,290
Good job.

1763
01:14:52,350 --> 01:14:52,910
Oh no.

1764
01:14:55,730 --> 01:14:56,450
Good stuff.

1765
01:14:56,510 --> 01:14:56,770
Genius.

1766
01:15:01,070 --> 01:15:01,610
That's okay.

1767
01:15:01,710 --> 01:15:01,990
That's cool.

1768
01:15:02,470 --> 01:15:03,530
That was a great round.

1769
01:15:03,590 --> 01:15:04,390
I know you lost it.

1770
01:15:04,510 --> 01:15:05,550
But it's a good round.

1771
01:15:05,830 --> 01:15:07,190
You played that round very well.

1772
01:15:07,690 --> 01:15:08,090
Yeah.

1773
01:15:09,350 --> 01:15:09,750
Nice.

1774
01:15:12,190 --> 01:15:12,710
It's cool.

1775
01:15:21,700 --> 01:15:22,100
Oh.

1776
01:15:22,340 --> 01:15:23,420
I keep forgetting that.

1777
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:25,480
Helicopter will grab you like that.

1778
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:26,840
I think she hits me.

1779
01:15:26,860 --> 01:15:27,260
Oh huge.

1780
01:15:28,780 --> 01:15:29,800
And you have heat.

1781
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:31,560
Run up.

1782
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:32,800
Yeah actually that's big.

1783
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:33,460
Okay.

1784
01:15:34,980 --> 01:15:37,020
She'll duck after she blocks it.

1785
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:38,100
So you can hit her with the square.

1786
01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:40,540
Okay.

1787
01:15:41,580 --> 01:15:42,000
Okay.

1788
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:42,340
Yes!

1789
01:15:43,100 --> 01:15:43,520
No.

1790
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:47,580
No I don't think I buffered it though.

1791
01:15:47,720 --> 01:15:48,040
Nice try.

1792
01:15:48,100 --> 01:15:50,100
I didn't buffer it.

1793
01:15:51,140 --> 01:15:51,980
Before yeah.

1794
01:15:52,100 --> 01:15:53,420
Very close though.

1795
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:53,740
Yeah.

1796
01:15:54,280 --> 01:15:55,220
That was a good match.

1797
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:56,520
You played your game play.

1798
01:15:56,680 --> 01:15:57,300
You played it well.

1799
01:15:57,640 --> 01:15:58,780
It just you know.

1800
01:15:58,780 --> 01:15:59,780
She got a couple more hits.

1801
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:00,300
Yeah.

1802
01:16:01,720 --> 01:16:03,580
This is actually so doable.

1803
01:16:04,160 --> 01:16:04,320
Yeah.

1804
01:16:09,250 --> 01:16:09,710
Ah!

1805
01:16:12,830 --> 01:16:13,550
It's all good.

1806
01:16:13,670 --> 01:16:13,970
It's all good.

1807
01:16:14,430 --> 01:16:15,090
Gamer time.

1808
01:16:15,570 --> 01:16:16,250
Gamers only.

1809
01:16:16,390 --> 01:16:17,170
From here on out.

1810
01:16:17,230 --> 01:16:17,890
Only gamers.

1811
01:16:18,190 --> 01:16:18,930
It's all for gamers.

1812
01:16:19,030 --> 01:16:19,330
Don't worry.

1813
01:16:21,170 --> 01:16:21,910
Good stuff.

1814
01:16:22,110 --> 01:16:22,530
Okay.

1815
01:16:23,670 --> 01:16:24,130
Unlucky.

1816
01:16:28,030 --> 01:16:28,490
Nice!

1817
01:16:29,510 --> 01:16:30,430
Good grab.

1818
01:16:36,820 --> 01:16:38,800
Oh he wants to press buttons so bad.

1819
01:16:40,580 --> 01:16:41,380
This Yoshimitsu.

1820
01:16:41,560 --> 01:16:41,740
Nice.

1821
01:16:42,940 --> 01:16:43,340
Okay.

1822
01:16:44,540 --> 01:16:45,180
Good stuff.

1823
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:45,840
Good weight.

1824
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:47,240
Excellent patience.

1825
01:16:47,680 --> 01:16:48,600
I don't hit this.

1826
01:16:48,920 --> 01:16:49,260
Oh I do!

1827
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:50,840
Yeah I think you win.

1828
01:16:50,920 --> 01:16:52,140
Yeah that's too much damage.

1829
01:16:52,220 --> 01:16:52,780
I'm a little lamb.

1830
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:54,300
Hell yeah.

1831
01:16:57,140 --> 01:16:57,540
Nice.

1832
01:17:00,100 --> 01:17:02,820
Wait no she counter blocked it.

1833
01:17:03,080 --> 01:17:03,740
That's fine.

1834
01:17:03,780 --> 01:17:04,120
That's fine.

1835
01:17:04,200 --> 01:17:04,680
You got the hit.

1836
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:14,560
Nice.

1837
01:17:14,580 --> 01:17:15,240
Another one.

1838
01:17:16,660 --> 01:17:17,220
Nice.

1839
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:18,260
Good wizard.

1840
01:17:21,320 --> 01:17:21,880
Yes!

1841
01:17:21,980 --> 01:17:23,500
Just bring it back.

1842
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:24,800
Oh my god no!

1843
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:26,640
Okay.

1844
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:27,960
Okay.

1845
01:17:30,820 --> 01:17:31,520
Blast him!

1846
01:17:31,740 --> 01:17:32,640
Bring it home.

1847
01:17:32,720 --> 01:17:33,060
Bring it home.

1848
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:33,740
Okay.

1849
01:17:35,640 --> 01:17:36,960
You're in your fucking element.

1850
01:17:37,580 --> 01:17:38,140
Okay.

1851
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:40,000
Good stuff!

1852
01:17:48,860 --> 01:17:49,740
Oh no.

1853
01:17:49,940 --> 01:17:50,340
Great.

1854
01:17:50,520 --> 01:17:51,220
Great block.

1855
01:17:51,460 --> 01:17:52,260
Patience is great here.

1856
01:17:52,260 --> 01:17:52,300
It's fine.

1857
01:17:52,300 --> 01:17:52,840
Great block.

1858
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:54,400
Yes!

1859
01:17:55,860 --> 01:17:57,520
You're doing so fucking awesome.

1860
01:17:57,840 --> 01:17:58,360
Nice!

1861
01:18:00,720 --> 01:18:01,500
Good blocks!

1862
01:18:05,320 --> 01:18:05,840
Ahhhh.

1863
01:18:06,240 --> 01:18:06,760
Alright.

1864
01:18:06,860 --> 01:18:07,040
It's alright.

1865
01:18:07,260 --> 01:18:07,580
It's cool.

1866
01:18:07,700 --> 01:18:08,100
It's one round.

1867
01:18:08,380 --> 01:18:10,000
This is Tekken.

1868
01:18:10,300 --> 01:18:10,820
Yeah.

1869
01:18:11,260 --> 01:18:13,020
This is learning Tekken 100%.

1870
01:18:13,020 --> 01:18:13,220
Yeah.

1871
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:17,000
Oh.

1872
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:21,520
She realized I know her counter.

1873
01:18:26,830 --> 01:18:28,770
What the fuck was that?

1874
01:18:29,430 --> 01:18:30,490
They didn't juke you?

1875
01:18:31,690 --> 01:18:32,370
Nice try.

1876
01:18:32,470 --> 01:18:32,670
Okay.

1877
01:18:33,010 --> 01:18:34,110
Some Naruto shit.

1878
01:18:34,230 --> 01:18:34,530
What the fuck?

1879
01:18:34,550 --> 01:18:34,830
That's alright.

1880
01:18:34,970 --> 01:18:35,310
That's alright.

1881
01:18:36,890 --> 01:18:38,070
Just run your shit.

1882
01:18:38,630 --> 01:18:39,510
Try your best.

1883
01:18:39,510 --> 01:18:39,810
Here we go.

1884
01:18:41,590 --> 01:18:42,350
Love that.

1885
01:18:43,490 --> 01:18:44,010
Yes.

1886
01:18:45,990 --> 01:18:46,970
Oh my god.

1887
01:18:48,550 --> 01:18:49,070
Nice.

1888
01:18:53,560 --> 01:18:54,080
Nice.

1889
01:18:58,560 --> 01:18:59,080
Nice.

1890
01:18:59,080 --> 01:18:59,080
What?

1891
01:18:59,280 --> 01:18:59,980
The hits?

1892
01:19:00,100 --> 01:19:00,620
Alright.

1893
01:19:02,860 --> 01:19:03,380
Nice.

1894
01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:03,880
Good grab.

1895
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:05,280
Oh no.

1896
01:19:05,380 --> 01:19:05,980
She got me.

1897
01:19:06,140 --> 01:19:07,140
I didn't heal it.

1898
01:19:07,480 --> 01:19:07,920
Oh.

1899
01:19:09,300 --> 01:19:10,140
Very close.

1900
01:19:11,460 --> 01:19:13,040
You ran your game.

1901
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:13,660
You did great.

1902
01:19:13,740 --> 01:19:14,080
Honestly.

1903
01:19:14,440 --> 01:19:15,520
That was so close.

1904
01:19:15,820 --> 01:19:16,280
Yeah.

1905
01:19:17,300 --> 01:19:19,100
I don't like to blow smoke.

1906
01:19:19,100 --> 01:19:20,660
But that was genuinely...

1907
01:19:20,660 --> 01:19:22,200
That was good Tekken.

1908
01:19:22,340 --> 01:19:23,200
And that's what happens.

1909
01:19:23,340 --> 01:19:23,540
Ahhh.

1910
01:19:25,080 --> 01:19:27,120
And we'll clean this one up and then we'll go next.

1911
01:19:28,420 --> 01:19:28,860
That was so close.

1912
01:19:28,860 --> 01:19:28,860
Yeah.

1913
01:19:28,980 --> 01:19:29,100
Yeah.

1914
01:19:29,100 --> 01:19:30,580
At the evil run back.

1915
01:19:30,860 --> 01:19:31,880
When Gumi is there.

1916
01:19:32,080 --> 01:19:32,720
We'll all be laughing.

1917
01:19:32,720 --> 01:19:33,080
Yeah.

1918
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:35,380
We'll be fucking loud in that room.

1919
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:35,660
Yeah.

1920
01:19:35,660 --> 01:19:38,800
I'll be like, Fucking beat her ass.

1921
01:19:40,360 --> 01:19:40,800
Oh.

1922
01:19:45,240 --> 01:19:47,140
I don't know what I could have done differently there.

1923
01:19:47,420 --> 01:19:49,780
I feel like she adapted so fast too.

1924
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:51,680
Yeah.

1925
01:19:51,780 --> 01:19:52,980
She hit you with the hella rage arts.

1926
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:53,600
So like.

1927
01:19:53,660 --> 01:19:54,660
I guess just block.

1928
01:19:54,940 --> 01:19:55,440
You know.

1929
01:19:55,480 --> 01:19:56,060
Call it out.

1930
01:19:56,160 --> 01:19:57,260
And then you get a full launch.

1931
01:20:00,180 --> 01:20:00,580
Yeah.

1932
01:20:00,620 --> 01:20:02,640
And you blocked her lows perfectly.

1933
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:04,160
We just have to mash the four.

1934
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:07,180
And you ducked her the three one thing too.

1935
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:08,080
But again.

1936
01:20:08,120 --> 01:20:08,400
Yeah.

1937
01:20:08,680 --> 01:20:09,080
Yeah.

1938
01:20:10,420 --> 01:20:11,440
But it was good.

1939
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:11,940
You were...

1940
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:14,000
Defensively you were doing great.

1941
01:20:14,140 --> 01:20:15,560
I should have alley kicked more.

1942
01:20:17,160 --> 01:20:17,560
Maybe.

1943
01:20:17,820 --> 01:20:18,880
I should have alley kicked.

1944
01:20:19,780 --> 01:20:19,880
Alright.

1945
01:20:19,940 --> 01:20:19,940
Alright.

1946
01:20:20,100 --> 01:20:20,180
Alright.

1947
01:20:20,180 --> 01:20:20,520
Next.

1948
01:20:20,760 --> 01:20:21,560
Next match.

1949
01:20:21,780 --> 01:20:22,860
And for the future.

1950
01:20:23,080 --> 01:20:24,540
Just fucking send it.

1951
01:20:24,680 --> 01:20:26,240
Just alley kick.

1952
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:27,300
Don't listen to coach.

1953
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:28,080
You don't know what I'm talking about.

1954
01:20:29,080 --> 01:20:31,560
This Pikmin thing is the funniest thing I've ever seen.

1955
01:20:31,640 --> 01:20:32,140
In my life.

1956
01:20:34,100 --> 01:20:35,520
He's immune to fire by the way.

1957
01:20:42,670 --> 01:20:43,070
Mmhmm.

1958
01:20:50,030 --> 01:20:50,430
Okay.

1959
01:20:50,430 --> 01:20:50,930
King battle.

1960
01:20:51,250 --> 01:20:51,650
Nice.

1961
01:20:57,190 --> 01:20:57,630
Nice.

1962
01:20:57,630 --> 01:20:58,350
Round two.

1963
01:21:37,980 --> 01:21:38,420
Nice.

1964
01:21:47,560 --> 01:21:48,000
Oh.

1965
01:21:48,180 --> 01:21:48,540
Nice.

1966
01:21:50,520 --> 01:21:50,960
Oh.

1967
01:21:50,980 --> 01:21:51,080
Nice.

1968
01:21:51,080 --> 01:21:51,080
Yes!

1969
01:21:51,540 --> 01:21:51,880
Yes!

1970
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:56,500
We are alley kick central.

1971
01:21:56,640 --> 01:21:57,320
We are alley kick central.

1972
01:21:57,320 --> 01:21:59,180
When you block a back one two.

1973
01:21:59,300 --> 01:22:00,180
Back one two and back.

1974
01:22:00,680 --> 01:22:01,320
It's unsafe.

1975
01:22:02,180 --> 01:22:05,060
Or you can even duck the second and hop kick him.

1976
01:22:07,220 --> 01:22:07,660
Sick.

1977
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:08,120
Sick.

1978
01:22:31,250 --> 01:22:33,250
Also if you jab jab he's gonna duck.

1979
01:22:33,350 --> 01:22:34,590
You can jab jab hop kick him.

1980
01:22:34,690 --> 01:22:37,570
Also after running three he's gonna duck every time right now too.

1981
01:22:49,470 --> 01:22:49,910
See?

1982
01:23:02,780 --> 01:23:03,440
Yeah, yeah.

1983
01:23:03,540 --> 01:23:04,440
He's autopiloting.

1984
01:23:24,220 --> 01:23:25,500
I just noticed you're a pig.

1985
01:23:27,180 --> 01:23:28,780
We know what he's doing.

1986
01:23:29,260 --> 01:23:33,520
Jab jab mid and then running three mid.

1987
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:34,440
That's what you gotta do.

1988
01:23:35,100 --> 01:23:36,780
You got this brother.

1989
01:23:48,310 --> 01:23:49,950
He might stop now.

1990
01:23:50,070 --> 01:23:52,810
He might stop now but it's up to you to recognize it.

1991
01:23:56,270 --> 01:23:56,750
Guaranteed.

1992
01:23:57,870 --> 01:23:58,110
Get up.

1993
01:24:05,870 --> 01:24:07,290
He's doing it every time.

1994
01:24:07,350 --> 01:24:08,190
It's an ice break.

1995
01:24:11,390 --> 01:24:11,890
Fuck.

1996
01:24:12,670 --> 01:24:13,610
I got anxious.

1997
01:24:14,570 --> 01:24:15,190
It's okay.

1998
01:24:15,470 --> 01:24:15,590
It's okay.

1999
01:24:15,790 --> 01:24:16,410
Fuckin' go.

2000
01:24:16,850 --> 01:24:18,070
That lean is for you.

2001
01:24:18,190 --> 01:24:18,790
Slurp it up.

2002
01:24:21,730 --> 01:24:23,310
There's no way.

2003
01:24:24,670 --> 01:24:25,390
Mop mop.

2004
01:24:36,690 --> 01:24:37,190
Okay.

2005
01:24:38,450 --> 01:24:39,230
There's a strike.

2006
01:24:40,050 --> 01:24:41,830
Fuckin' Mug'd Giga chad.

2007
01:24:41,950 --> 01:24:42,550
Like, jeez.

2008
01:24:45,980 --> 01:24:46,790
Fuck yeah.

2009
01:24:48,510 --> 01:24:49,050
Dude.

2010
01:24:50,630 --> 01:24:51,170
Oh!

2011
01:24:51,330 --> 01:24:52,190
He's dead Kony.

2012
01:24:52,270 --> 01:24:52,870
Oh my god.

2013
01:24:52,930 --> 01:24:53,530
You can mild walk for this.

2014
01:24:53,670 --> 01:24:54,610
Well almost dead.

2015
01:24:58,830 --> 01:24:59,570
It's fine.

2016
01:24:59,750 --> 01:24:59,990
It's fine.

2017
01:25:07,700 --> 01:25:08,240
Fuck.

2018
01:25:11,670 --> 01:25:12,260
Nice job.

2019
01:25:12,260 --> 01:25:12,820
Nice job.

2020
01:25:12,980 --> 01:25:15,140
I mean, Kony obviously mused, let's be honest here.

2021
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:32,000
Nice punish.

2022
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:32,700
I haven't gone for that yet.

2023
01:25:33,140 --> 01:25:34,280
Nice punish though.

2024
01:25:38,160 --> 01:25:39,620
Let's fucking go, baby!

2025
01:25:40,640 --> 01:25:41,120
Nice!

2026
01:25:42,140 --> 01:25:43,000
KJM is bald!

2027
01:25:43,620 --> 01:25:44,500
KJM is bald!

2028
01:25:45,360 --> 01:25:46,640
I agree with it.

2029
01:25:49,300 --> 01:25:50,640
He wants to get off that stage.

2030
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:55,320
Even though, yeah, it's a good King stage, but he's also King, so...

2031
01:25:58,920 --> 01:26:00,280
I'm gonna pin this KJM.

2032
01:26:03,040 --> 01:26:04,800
Remember Kony, back went two.

2033
01:26:04,940 --> 01:26:05,960
You go back went two and back.

2034
01:26:06,300 --> 01:26:06,700
Right.

2035
01:26:06,780 --> 01:26:07,060
Yeah.

2036
01:26:07,300 --> 01:26:10,340
Yeah, that just... if he hits you twice and you block it...

2037
01:26:10,820 --> 01:26:11,540
Wop, wop.

2038
01:26:11,640 --> 01:26:12,540
And he explodes.

2039
01:26:12,900 --> 01:26:18,140
The optimal punish is to duck the second hit and hopkick him for it, but yeah, if we haven't practiced it, just punish it.

2040
01:26:18,340 --> 01:26:18,840
All good.

2041
01:26:18,920 --> 01:26:19,260
Yeah.

2042
01:26:20,660 --> 01:26:21,380
And yeah, he's dead.

2043
01:26:21,400 --> 01:26:22,000
He's still a ducker.

2044
01:26:22,060 --> 01:26:22,860
1-1 mid.

2045
01:26:27,180 --> 01:26:27,980
Boom, baby!

2046
01:26:30,180 --> 01:26:30,580
Nice!

2047
01:26:40,440 --> 01:26:41,300
Damn, that was good.

2048
01:26:43,480 --> 01:26:43,880
Yeah.

2049
01:26:49,170 --> 01:26:50,810
Fuck, I tried to Shiny Wizard that.

2050
01:26:52,730 --> 01:26:53,490
Nice Sprinkler.

2051
01:26:53,990 --> 01:26:54,790
Oh, fuck.

2052
01:26:54,790 --> 01:26:55,250
I already broke that.

2053
01:26:55,410 --> 01:26:56,270
That was bad.

2054
01:26:56,390 --> 01:26:57,030
You just mash him.

2055
01:26:57,070 --> 01:26:57,210
That's fine.

2056
01:26:57,310 --> 01:26:57,790
That's fine.

2057
01:26:57,910 --> 01:26:58,270
That's fine.

2058
01:26:59,050 --> 01:26:59,450
Reset.

2059
01:26:59,450 --> 01:27:00,650
Act like that didn't even happen.

2060
01:27:00,850 --> 01:27:00,910
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2061
01:27:00,910 --> 01:27:01,970
That round did not happen.

2062
01:27:11,780 --> 01:27:13,100
So, now you poke, poke, grab.

2063
01:27:18,840 --> 01:27:19,580
Nice hop.

2064
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:21,400
Nice.

2065
01:27:38,370 --> 01:27:38,770
Fuck!

2066
01:27:40,630 --> 01:27:41,290
That's all good.

2067
01:27:41,350 --> 01:27:41,890
You got it.

2068
01:27:42,250 --> 01:27:42,650
Oh, that's okay.

2069
01:27:42,650 --> 01:27:43,230
He's got this.

2070
01:27:43,230 --> 01:27:43,690
He's got this.

2071
01:27:43,830 --> 01:27:44,230
You got it.

2072
01:27:44,230 --> 01:27:44,550
Hit them.

2073
01:27:44,570 --> 01:27:44,930
Come on, baby.

2074
01:27:45,230 --> 01:27:46,070
Ah, yo.

2075
01:27:46,450 --> 01:27:47,050
It's all right.

2076
01:28:05,050 --> 01:28:05,450
Yo.

2077
01:28:05,950 --> 01:28:06,570
Well done.

2078
01:28:07,210 --> 01:28:08,050
Come on, baby!

2079
01:28:08,270 --> 01:28:09,030
Oh, nice go!

2080
01:28:09,170 --> 01:28:09,190
Nice!

2081
01:28:17,500 --> 01:28:19,440
Oh my god, he smashed Punisher.

2082
01:28:19,540 --> 01:28:20,280
Look at that damage.

2083
01:28:20,740 --> 01:28:21,180
Nooooo!

2084
01:28:24,260 --> 01:28:25,320
Oh my god!

2085
01:28:28,360 --> 01:28:29,620
He didn't take it!

2086
01:28:31,940 --> 01:28:32,380
Let's go!

2087
01:28:32,980 --> 01:28:33,900
Wrap it up!

2088
01:28:34,140 --> 01:28:35,020
Wrap this shit!

2089
01:28:35,020 --> 01:28:35,480
Wrap it up, baby!

2090
01:28:35,540 --> 01:28:35,840
Keep that momentum!

2091
01:28:36,160 --> 01:28:37,020
Oh my gosh!

2092
01:28:55,960 --> 01:28:56,720
Nice grab.

2093
01:28:57,940 --> 01:28:58,980
You have heal.

2094
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:10,480
Holy shit!

2095
01:29:10,540 --> 01:29:11,120
Oh my god!

2096
01:29:11,540 --> 01:29:12,220
What else?

2097
01:29:13,360 --> 01:29:14,880
Oh my god!

2098
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:15,960
He got it!

2099
01:29:16,360 --> 01:29:16,460
No!

2100
01:29:17,120 --> 01:29:17,600
No!

2101
01:29:18,620 --> 01:29:19,360
You're hit!

2102
01:29:19,460 --> 01:29:19,920
You're hit!

2103
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:20,220
You're hit!

2104
01:29:20,220 --> 01:29:21,420
This is so cool!

2105
01:29:21,540 --> 01:29:22,560
There's no way!

2106
01:29:22,740 --> 01:29:23,160
You're just different.

2107
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:23,860
You're just different.

2108
01:29:24,240 --> 01:29:25,780
I can't believe it.

2109
01:29:25,800 --> 01:29:26,840
He's so much better!

2110
01:29:27,080 --> 01:29:27,560
You're just different.

2111
01:29:27,660 --> 01:29:28,380
You're just different.

2112
01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:29,400
You're just different.

2113
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:29,780
Yes!

2114
01:29:30,440 --> 01:29:31,120
Hold on.

2115
01:29:32,980 --> 01:29:33,780
Holy fuck.

2116
01:29:34,400 --> 01:29:34,840
Alley Cat Strike.

2117
01:29:34,840 --> 01:29:35,260
Alley Cat Strike.

2118
01:29:35,260 --> 01:29:36,100
That's a new team name.

2119
01:29:36,300 --> 01:29:37,520
I can't believe it, dude.

2120
01:29:37,780 --> 01:29:39,000
That was incredible.

2121
01:29:39,300 --> 01:29:40,000
That was...

2122
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:40,520
That was...

2123
01:29:40,520 --> 01:29:41,000
That...

2124
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:42,020
Oh my god!

2125
01:29:42,200 --> 01:29:42,420
Alley Cat Strike.

2126
01:29:42,540 --> 01:29:43,920
That King matchup!

2127
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:47,720
How is it?

2128
01:29:47,800 --> 01:29:49,460
I just wasn't alley kicking enough!

2129
01:29:49,780 --> 01:29:51,260
I shouldn't have left my Origen!

2130
01:29:51,260 --> 01:29:53,200
Next match, let's just send it.

2131
01:29:53,260 --> 01:29:53,660
That's what...

2132
01:29:53,660 --> 01:29:55,160
If it speaks to you, that's what I'll do.

2133
01:29:55,760 --> 01:29:57,260
I gotta put the cuff back on.

2134
01:29:57,680 --> 01:29:58,640
Holy fuck!

2135
01:29:58,720 --> 01:29:59,560
Oh my god.

2136
01:29:59,560 --> 01:29:59,920
God, dude.

2137
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:00,880
It's so fucking...

2138
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:01,040
Okay.

2139
01:30:01,780 --> 01:30:02,300
Let's go.

2140
01:30:02,440 --> 01:30:02,560
Dude.

2141
01:30:02,680 --> 01:30:03,060
All right.

2142
01:30:03,140 --> 01:30:03,540
All right.

2143
01:30:03,580 --> 01:30:03,880
All right.

2144
01:30:03,880 --> 01:30:04,120
All right.

2145
01:30:04,220 --> 01:30:05,980
A little bit too nerve-wracking.

2146
01:30:06,140 --> 01:30:06,980
Holy shit.

2147
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:09,140
No, these are hard to watch.

2148
01:30:09,180 --> 01:30:10,020
For sure, man.

2149
01:30:10,240 --> 01:30:10,260
Yeah.

2150
01:30:11,780 --> 01:30:12,980
World's hardest watch.

2151
01:30:14,480 --> 01:30:15,260
That was...

2152
01:30:15,260 --> 01:30:15,880
Oh my god.

2153
01:30:15,920 --> 01:30:18,480
That was like the slowest King matchup I've ever seen.

2154
01:30:19,900 --> 01:30:20,800
It's so like...

2155
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:22,120
It's like a chess game.

2156
01:30:23,340 --> 01:30:24,140
Yeah, dude.

2157
01:30:24,620 --> 01:30:26,660
They were playing so like defensive.

2158
01:30:27,140 --> 01:30:28,420
Oh, Kony, you gotta press the...

2159
01:30:28,420 --> 01:30:28,620
Yeah.

2160
01:30:28,720 --> 01:30:29,320
Oh, I'm sorry.

2161
01:30:29,400 --> 01:30:29,700
I thought...

2162
01:30:29,700 --> 01:30:30,120
Yeah.

2163
01:30:30,300 --> 01:30:30,800
You're good, dude.

2164
01:30:30,820 --> 01:30:30,860
Yeah.

2165
01:30:30,860 --> 01:30:32,060
I think I pressed it twice.

2166
01:30:32,100 --> 01:30:32,360
Sorry.

2167
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:34,040
God.

2168
01:30:34,180 --> 01:30:35,280
That's what I'm talking about.

2169
01:30:35,700 --> 01:30:36,600
I'm so G'd up right now.

2170
01:30:36,600 --> 01:30:38,600
They played so defensive and like...

2171
01:30:38,600 --> 01:30:38,860
Yeah.

2172
01:30:38,860 --> 01:30:39,260
Oh, man.

2173
01:30:39,260 --> 01:30:39,700
Yeah.

2174
01:30:39,780 --> 01:30:40,680
That was incredible.

2175
01:30:41,580 --> 01:30:42,120
All right.

2176
01:30:42,140 --> 01:30:42,360
Hold on.

2177
01:30:42,420 --> 01:30:42,640
I'm gonna...

2178
01:30:42,640 --> 01:30:44,140
He's definitely studied us.

2179
01:30:44,420 --> 01:30:45,520
You got this, Kline.

2180
01:30:46,060 --> 01:30:46,500
All right.

2181
01:30:49,300 --> 01:30:51,960
I wonder what his heart rate was during that match.

2182
01:30:52,040 --> 01:30:53,000
Real shit.

2183
01:30:53,100 --> 01:30:53,480
Yeah.

2184
01:30:54,440 --> 01:30:57,760
Oh, they gotta get heart rate monitors for a Sage Jam Slam 3.

2185
01:31:00,720 --> 01:31:01,860
Bro has pop off.

2186
01:31:01,920 --> 01:31:02,720
You gotta see it.

2187
01:31:04,180 --> 01:31:05,280
Oh, my God.

2188
01:31:05,380 --> 01:31:06,900
That was like so close too.

2189
01:31:07,460 --> 01:31:08,440
You got this, Kline.

2190
01:31:08,440 --> 01:31:08,500
All right.

2191
01:31:08,500 --> 01:31:09,200
Time to lock in, brother.

2192
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:10,160
You got this.

2193
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:11,520
Easy.

2194
01:31:11,620 --> 01:31:12,080
Kishin.

2195
01:31:12,200 --> 01:31:12,980
I believe.

2196
01:31:29,540 --> 01:31:31,500
I miss round robin day.

2197
01:31:45,760 --> 01:31:47,880
He continues to get up incorrectly.

2198
01:31:53,020 --> 01:31:53,540
Nice.

2199
01:31:53,740 --> 01:31:54,160
Nice.

2200
01:31:55,440 --> 01:31:56,000
Oh, my God.

2201
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:56,780
Round two.

2202
01:31:57,800 --> 01:31:58,280
Fight!

2203
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:02,420
Fucking go slime!

2204
01:32:03,460 --> 01:32:04,720
Put her at the fucking wall!

2205
01:32:05,020 --> 01:32:05,780
Good shit!

2206
01:32:08,440 --> 01:32:10,380
Oosh, oosh, oosh, oosh!

2207
01:32:10,760 --> 01:32:12,160
What's the answer, young lady?

2208
01:32:12,420 --> 01:32:12,980
Eat her up!

2209
01:32:13,960 --> 01:32:15,140
It's fine, it's fine, it's fine.

2210
01:32:15,220 --> 01:32:15,680
Give it a second.

2211
01:32:17,400 --> 01:32:18,320
Side walling him.

2212
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:20,560
Counter hit.

2213
01:32:20,780 --> 01:32:21,920
We went neutral though.

2214
01:32:22,080 --> 01:32:24,200
You got strength, but we went neutral, Drew.

2215
01:32:25,140 --> 01:32:26,440
Oh, we got a spring kick.

2216
01:32:26,480 --> 01:32:28,740
We got a spring kick to get any damage.

2217
01:32:29,580 --> 01:32:31,640
We got to do the destroyer shit.

2218
01:32:31,760 --> 01:32:32,100
Okay.

2219
01:32:32,420 --> 01:32:33,360
Oh, damn!

2220
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:34,800
Any damage.

2221
01:32:34,860 --> 01:32:35,960
We need orange threats.

2222
01:32:36,040 --> 01:32:36,760
Oh, shit!

2223
01:32:38,240 --> 01:32:39,040
Round three.

2224
01:32:40,060 --> 01:32:40,460
Fight!

2225
01:32:40,460 --> 01:32:40,960
We get up here.

2226
01:32:41,520 --> 01:32:42,100
Good shit.

2227
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:43,400
Nice!

2228
01:32:48,350 --> 01:32:49,050
Oh, wow.

2229
01:32:49,090 --> 01:32:49,390
Interesting.

2230
01:32:55,290 --> 01:32:56,430
Okay, this is fine.

2231
01:32:56,430 --> 01:32:56,510
We got a spring kick.

2232
01:32:56,530 --> 01:32:56,830
It's all good.

2233
01:32:56,910 --> 01:32:57,470
It's one round.

2234
01:32:57,650 --> 01:32:59,070
Yeah, you just give him one.

2235
01:33:09,560 --> 01:33:10,520
Slap her in the face.

2236
01:33:17,350 --> 01:33:18,690
Big whiff punish slide.

2237
01:33:24,220 --> 01:33:24,660
Nice!

2238
01:33:33,010 --> 01:33:33,870
Is that real?

2239
01:33:34,430 --> 01:33:34,870
Yes.

2240
01:33:34,870 --> 01:33:35,810
Why doesn't it lead into stuff?

2241
01:33:37,550 --> 01:33:40,110
If you block the low, you can launch her for it.

2242
01:33:40,270 --> 01:33:40,670
Mmm.

2243
01:33:43,970 --> 01:33:44,410
Oh.

2244
01:33:46,690 --> 01:33:47,570
Josh is in here.

2245
01:33:47,690 --> 01:33:47,830
Final round.

2246
01:33:48,610 --> 01:33:49,330
Fight!

2247
01:33:56,400 --> 01:33:57,120
Incredible.

2248
01:33:57,620 --> 01:33:58,520
Good shoot.

2249
01:34:02,200 --> 01:34:03,180
Wall combo.

2250
01:34:04,620 --> 01:34:05,340
Okay.

2251
01:34:05,880 --> 01:34:06,240
Okay.

2252
01:34:06,780 --> 01:34:07,820
A-doom!

2253
01:34:11,160 --> 01:34:12,640
Yeah, I come out sometimes!

2254
01:34:15,240 --> 01:34:16,460
Oh, no.

2255
01:34:18,180 --> 01:34:18,900
Oh!

2256
01:34:24,610 --> 01:34:25,330
Oh!

2257
01:34:25,790 --> 01:34:26,050
Oh, close.

2258
01:34:26,390 --> 01:34:26,610
Close.

2259
01:34:26,670 --> 01:34:27,110
Very close.

2260
01:34:27,250 --> 01:34:28,770
I'm delay a little bit.

2261
01:34:28,990 --> 01:34:29,950
Crazy good match.

2262
01:34:30,070 --> 01:34:30,590
Crazy good match.

2263
01:34:30,810 --> 01:34:31,090
Very good.

2264
01:34:33,790 --> 01:34:34,310
Aw.

2265
01:34:35,630 --> 01:34:36,590
You win.

2266
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:48,800
Round one.

2267
01:34:49,800 --> 01:34:50,320
Fight!

2268
01:34:50,700 --> 01:34:52,300
That's what I'm talking about, baby.

2269
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:53,520
Flipper!

2270
01:34:54,800 --> 01:34:55,320
Nice.

2271
01:34:55,320 --> 01:34:56,200
Oh, my gosh.

2272
01:34:57,020 --> 01:34:57,540
But...

2273
01:34:57,540 --> 01:34:58,580
Oh, my gosh.

2274
01:34:59,420 --> 01:34:59,800
Nice.

2275
01:35:08,240 --> 01:35:09,260
Oh, I fucked up bad.

2276
01:35:10,120 --> 01:35:10,640
It's okay.

2277
01:35:11,120 --> 01:35:11,500
Composure.

2278
01:35:15,220 --> 01:35:16,020
Back the slime.

2279
01:35:21,490 --> 01:35:21,990
Damn it.

2280
01:35:23,670 --> 01:35:24,490
Um, you're alive.

2281
01:35:25,250 --> 01:35:28,610
Keep in mind, if he's gonna rage art once, he'll probably send it again.

2282
01:35:31,330 --> 01:35:31,790
All right.

2283
01:35:31,830 --> 01:35:32,550
I have my mix up.

2284
01:35:32,590 --> 01:35:32,770
You ready?

2285
01:35:33,430 --> 01:35:33,810
Yes.

2286
01:35:33,850 --> 01:35:34,110
What?

2287
01:35:34,550 --> 01:35:35,450
Why couldn't I get away?

2288
01:35:36,290 --> 01:35:36,670
I'm so close.

2289
01:35:36,670 --> 01:35:37,170
Oh.

2290
01:35:37,750 --> 01:35:38,230
Whatever.

2291
01:35:38,950 --> 01:35:39,690
It's all good.

2292
01:35:39,830 --> 01:35:40,230
Okay.

2293
01:35:56,750 --> 01:35:57,490
I'm panicking.

2294
01:36:01,240 --> 01:36:01,720
Oh.

2295
01:36:01,920 --> 01:36:02,460
Nice job.

2296
01:36:02,780 --> 01:36:04,080
No more G+.

2297
01:36:04,080 --> 01:36:05,160
I think she kills me.

2298
01:36:05,900 --> 01:36:06,600
Raging shit.

2299
01:36:13,610 --> 01:36:15,090
You could've won that.

2300
01:36:15,170 --> 01:36:16,050
You ducked that high.

2301
01:36:16,050 --> 01:36:16,350
She did.

2302
01:36:16,710 --> 01:36:18,030
You could've launched him for it.

2303
01:36:21,810 --> 01:36:22,290
Good.

2304
01:36:22,510 --> 01:36:23,110
Fucking hell.

2305
01:36:23,130 --> 01:36:23,270
Sweet.

2306
01:36:23,670 --> 01:36:24,430
Y'all are so good.

2307
01:36:24,430 --> 01:36:24,670
I'm gonna...

2308
01:36:39,540 --> 01:36:39,980
Nice.

2309
01:36:44,880 --> 01:36:46,780
Okay, so I can't G-Club that, it doesn't matter.

2310
01:36:48,700 --> 01:36:50,340
I just got outmatched.

2311
01:36:51,200 --> 01:36:52,560
Good try, good try.

2312
01:36:53,260 --> 01:36:53,620
That's fine, dude.

2313
01:36:54,260 --> 01:36:56,900
Alright, Propo, are you ready for your matchup soon?

2314
01:36:57,240 --> 01:36:58,100
What the fuck do you mean?

2315
01:36:58,120 --> 01:36:58,700
I could lose!

2316
01:36:59,080 --> 01:37:00,400
Matt, don't say that!

2317
01:37:07,740 --> 01:37:09,480
I'm always ready, yes.

2318
01:37:09,480 --> 01:37:11,980
You ready to play against another bear?

2319
01:37:13,840 --> 01:37:16,300
This could be a legendary fucking comeback by this guy.

2320
01:37:18,440 --> 01:37:21,500
You gotta get out of the lobby, Slime, my friend.

2321
01:37:25,480 --> 01:37:26,620
Alright, I'll try.

2322
01:37:27,400 --> 01:37:28,920
Yup, just play your best.

2323
01:37:29,940 --> 01:37:31,280
Training is already complete.

2324
01:37:31,980 --> 01:37:33,960
Oh, if you're wondering, I did throw up by the way.

2325
01:37:34,580 --> 01:37:35,500
Oh no!

2326
01:37:37,680 --> 01:37:39,380
I guess that's just life.

2327
01:37:39,700 --> 01:37:41,260
It's just part of me.

2328
01:37:41,520 --> 01:37:45,020
At least one throw up per slam.

2329
01:37:47,820 --> 01:37:52,500
My read is down back one, and then I'm gonna do the fucking sweep.

2330
01:37:52,920 --> 01:37:53,840
You got this, bro.

2331
01:37:54,120 --> 01:37:55,460
Oh, into the stratosphere?

2332
01:37:55,640 --> 01:37:56,940
Hold on, I'm gonna hit a funny combo.

2333
01:37:57,080 --> 01:37:57,720
Nothing else matters.

2334
01:38:01,760 --> 01:38:02,940
Depends how funny it is.

2335
01:38:03,120 --> 01:38:03,980
It's pretty funny, dude.

2336
01:38:03,980 --> 01:38:05,360
It better be pretty fucking funny.

2337
01:38:06,320 --> 01:38:07,220
My read is complete.

2338
01:38:08,580 --> 01:38:09,420
I'm gonna

2339
01:38:13,090 --> 01:38:14,810
hit a funny combo.

2340
01:38:14,810 --> 01:38:14,830
Nothing else matters.

2341
01:38:14,830 --> 01:38:15,170
I'm gonna hit a funny combo.

2342
01:38:19,290 --> 01:38:25,770
Nothing else matters.

2343
01:38:31,530 --> 01:38:33,350
Nice kala, man.

2344
01:38:33,350 --> 01:38:34,550
Well done.

2345
01:38:34,670 --> 01:38:35,410
Oh

2346
01:38:38,890 --> 01:38:41,390
my.

2347
01:38:41,590 --> 01:38:41,950
Love gnat.

2348
01:38:44,230 --> 01:38:45,430
American reset.

2349
01:38:49,490 --> 01:38:50,330
Oh, I hit one plus two.

2350
01:39:04,370 --> 01:39:05,850
When he's in heat, he's gonna run in.

2351
01:39:06,730 --> 01:39:07,550
Maybe walk around.

2352
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:31,660
Oh, fuck.

2353
01:39:31,720 --> 01:39:32,320
I didn't notice that.

2354
01:39:32,320 --> 01:39:32,500
Okay.

2355
01:39:32,620 --> 01:39:33,000
Skara.

2356
01:39:41,650 --> 01:39:42,030
Alright.

2357
01:39:42,030 --> 01:39:42,410
Upgrades.

2358
01:39:43,030 --> 01:39:43,910
Skara got some upgrades.

2359
01:39:44,250 --> 01:39:44,970
Yeah, Skara analyzed.

2360
01:39:44,970 --> 01:39:47,770
Yeah, you're blocked and if you just punish those things...

2361
01:39:47,770 --> 01:39:48,410
Oh, I know.

2362
01:39:48,470 --> 01:39:49,490
Let's fuck the launch too.

2363
01:39:49,630 --> 01:39:49,930
Hold on.

2364
01:40:02,280 --> 01:40:04,360
Oh my god, I just got fucking told.

2365
01:40:05,640 --> 01:40:06,200
That's okay.

2366
01:40:06,540 --> 01:40:07,460
Own them for it.

2367
01:40:09,920 --> 01:40:10,320
Nice.

2368
01:40:14,320 --> 01:40:15,500
He has his potion.

2369
01:40:15,860 --> 01:40:16,140
He has it.

2370
01:40:18,620 --> 01:40:19,260
Oh, fuck.

2371
01:40:19,360 --> 01:40:19,540
Okay.

2372
01:40:19,680 --> 01:40:20,100
Oh, man.

2373
01:40:20,120 --> 01:40:20,520
Okay.

2374
01:40:20,860 --> 01:40:21,260
Upgrades.

2375
01:40:22,640 --> 01:40:23,960
I'm just keeping it close.

2376
01:40:25,600 --> 01:40:26,580
That was a warm up.

2377
01:40:26,660 --> 01:40:27,120
That was a warm up.

2378
01:40:34,870 --> 01:40:35,490
Round one.

2379
01:40:36,450 --> 01:40:36,890
Fight.

2380
01:40:54,560 --> 01:40:55,440
Good shit.

2381
01:40:55,740 --> 01:40:56,180
Nice.

2382
01:40:56,360 --> 01:40:57,040
I'm gonna take him.

2383
01:40:57,340 --> 01:40:58,540
Does that hurt, Victor?

2384
01:40:58,740 --> 01:40:58,960
Good shit.

2385
01:40:59,100 --> 01:40:59,780
Good shit, dude.

2386
01:41:01,940 --> 01:41:03,920
He doesn't need to have any kids anymore.

2387
01:41:07,500 --> 01:41:08,660
Send that, dude.

2388
01:41:08,860 --> 01:41:09,520
Good launch.

2389
01:41:18,050 --> 01:41:18,490
Punish.

2390
01:41:18,490 --> 01:41:19,070
Hell it.

2391
01:41:19,070 --> 01:41:19,890
Oh, he's...

2392
01:41:20,730 --> 01:41:21,770
He's... Okay.

2393
01:41:22,190 --> 01:41:22,210
Oh.

2394
01:41:22,370 --> 01:41:23,530
Bon appétit.

2395
01:41:25,890 --> 01:41:27,070
Send that.

2396
01:41:27,110 --> 01:41:27,530
Nice.

2397
01:41:28,190 --> 01:41:29,350
He's back online.

2398
01:41:29,650 --> 01:41:30,650
He's back online.

2399
01:41:30,730 --> 01:41:31,130
He's risen.

2400
01:41:31,830 --> 01:41:32,670
We adapt.

2401
01:41:33,030 --> 01:41:34,170
He is fucking risen.

2402
01:41:34,390 --> 01:41:34,790
Fight.

2403
01:41:49,940 --> 01:41:50,700
It's okay.

2404
01:41:52,560 --> 01:41:52,920
No.

2405
01:41:52,920 --> 01:41:53,100
He's dead.

2406
01:41:53,720 --> 01:41:54,260
He's dead.

2407
01:41:55,600 --> 01:41:55,960
Clean.

2408
01:41:57,540 --> 01:41:57,900
No.

2409
01:41:57,900 --> 01:41:58,160
Nice.

2410
01:41:58,540 --> 01:41:58,900
He's dead.

2411
01:41:59,640 --> 01:42:00,820
I need to boost heat.

2412
01:42:01,280 --> 01:42:02,480
Bounce is still on the table.

2413
01:42:02,920 --> 01:42:04,600
That was his heat smash he went for too.

2414
01:42:06,620 --> 01:42:07,580
He still got bounce on the table.

2415
01:42:07,580 --> 01:42:09,180
Yeah, the floor blast is still on.

2416
01:42:11,720 --> 01:42:12,940
Oh, I try to heat boost.

2417
01:42:13,140 --> 01:42:13,320
Aw.

2418
01:42:14,580 --> 01:42:15,100
Nice try.

2419
01:42:15,160 --> 01:42:15,380
Nice try.

2420
01:42:15,420 --> 01:42:15,680
Nice try.

2421
01:42:15,980 --> 01:42:16,340
NTT.

2422
01:42:16,480 --> 01:42:16,720
NTT.

2423
01:42:17,200 --> 01:42:17,560
One round.

2424
01:42:17,880 --> 01:42:18,580
Still got time.

2425
01:42:19,040 --> 01:42:19,400
Fight.

2426
01:42:19,440 --> 01:42:19,680
Fight.

2427
01:42:20,280 --> 01:42:20,640
Final round.

2428
01:42:20,640 --> 01:42:20,680
NTT.

2429
01:42:29,410 --> 01:42:31,450
Oh my god, he's outplaying me, I'm sorry.

2430
01:42:32,570 --> 01:42:33,470
It's all good, it's all good.

2431
01:42:33,830 --> 01:42:36,210
Just keep it solid man, just play your game.

2432
01:42:41,520 --> 01:42:43,380
What the fuck, Skarra?!

2433
01:42:48,560 --> 01:42:48,980
Nice.

2434
01:42:48,980 --> 01:42:49,540
Oh yeah!

2435
01:42:50,260 --> 01:42:51,140
He has rage.

2436
01:42:53,540 --> 01:42:54,380
He's dead.

2437
01:42:54,940 --> 01:42:55,740
We blocked that.

2438
01:42:55,740 --> 01:42:56,380
Nice!

2439
01:42:57,020 --> 01:42:57,860
Good shit!

2440
01:42:58,000 --> 01:42:59,180
Oh my god.

2441
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:01,480
Go Matco, come on Matco!

2442
01:43:01,900 --> 01:43:04,620
Fucking young man, back to you.

2443
01:43:04,740 --> 01:43:06,480
Make him retire!

2444
01:43:07,400 --> 01:43:08,500
Change stage if you want.

2445
01:43:09,020 --> 01:43:09,960
No, I want him.

2446
01:43:11,740 --> 01:43:12,180
Yes,

2447
01:43:24,130 --> 01:43:24,550
that's right.

2448
01:43:33,330 --> 01:43:33,870
Nice!

2449
01:43:33,870 --> 01:43:34,210
Nice launch.

2450
01:43:34,210 --> 01:43:35,090
That's it.

2451
01:43:35,250 --> 01:43:35,550
Yeah!

2452
01:43:37,150 --> 01:43:38,270
Fucking go Jack!

2453
01:43:38,590 --> 01:43:39,110
Let's go.

2454
01:43:44,330 --> 01:43:44,870
One!

2455
01:43:45,490 --> 01:43:47,510
Oh my god, what are these combos?

2456
01:43:47,630 --> 01:43:47,950
Good morning.

2457
01:43:48,250 --> 01:43:49,590
That's how many sets he's getting.

2458
01:43:56,850 --> 01:43:57,930
Fuck you!

2459
01:43:58,470 --> 01:43:59,690
That's fucking right!

2460
01:44:00,590 --> 01:44:01,470
My god.

2461
01:44:02,510 --> 01:44:02,890
This kills, this kills.

2462
01:44:03,330 --> 01:44:04,930
Jesus is omnipresent.

2463
01:44:05,290 --> 01:44:05,810
Omniscience.

2464
01:44:05,810 --> 01:44:08,570
He knows what lies in your heart!

2465
01:44:08,710 --> 01:44:11,190
He can see what's in your heart and your mind!

2466
01:44:11,350 --> 01:44:12,330
You have sinned!

2467
01:44:15,450 --> 01:44:17,270
That was the biggest fuck you ever.

2468
01:44:17,430 --> 01:44:17,810
Oh he's dead.

2469
01:44:18,230 --> 01:44:21,710
Have you confessed to our lord and savior, Jack Jesus?

2470
01:44:23,010 --> 01:44:24,330
He cries for you.

2471
01:44:27,790 --> 01:44:29,370
Turns water to blood.

2472
01:44:30,650 --> 01:44:31,850
That move is so dumb.

2473
01:44:32,930 --> 01:44:33,530
Shining!

2474
01:44:34,810 --> 01:44:35,410
Nice!

2475
01:44:36,230 --> 01:44:37,310
Send the bomb.

2476
01:44:38,050 --> 01:44:39,390
That's the cause for heaven.

2477
01:44:39,650 --> 01:44:40,250
The satellite.

2478
01:44:42,750 --> 01:44:44,110
Message from God.

2479
01:44:44,330 --> 01:44:45,830
You can launch that one.

2480
01:44:45,930 --> 01:44:46,570
Kill him.

2481
01:44:46,710 --> 01:44:47,270
Kill him.

2482
01:44:47,330 --> 01:44:47,630
No!

2483
01:44:47,670 --> 01:44:48,610
What are we doing?

2484
01:44:51,150 --> 01:44:51,910
That's right!

2485
01:44:52,670 --> 01:44:53,270
Boom!

2486
01:44:53,690 --> 01:44:54,270
Yeah!

2487
01:44:54,270 --> 01:44:56,410
Good job, man.

2488
01:44:56,450 --> 01:44:57,550
What are you doing?

2489
01:44:57,790 --> 01:44:58,510
Did his break?

2490
01:44:58,530 --> 01:44:59,810
Oh my god!

2491
01:44:59,910 --> 01:45:00,430
Nice job.

2492
01:45:00,910 --> 01:45:02,290
I feel like his- Nice job.

2493
01:45:02,290 --> 01:45:03,990
We're fucking tilted off.

2494
01:45:03,990 --> 01:45:04,970
What the fuck?

2495
01:45:05,270 --> 01:45:06,710
Let's fucking go!

2496
01:45:07,930 --> 01:45:11,850
His higher decision making part of his brain just melted off.

2497
01:45:11,950 --> 01:45:13,550
He was screaming like an orange.

2498
01:45:13,650 --> 01:45:14,870
What the fuck was that, man?

2499
01:45:15,150 --> 01:45:17,370
He threw a rod and the engine seized.

2500
01:45:18,310 --> 01:45:18,830
Alright.

2501
01:45:19,470 --> 01:45:22,730
Bro, pro, are you gonna stay deafened to Fubby Focus?

2502
01:45:23,370 --> 01:45:25,590
Brother, we're sorry that we put you in this spot.

2503
01:45:25,850 --> 01:45:28,070
You should be.

2504
01:45:28,150 --> 01:45:30,490
This is crazy mental right here.

2505
01:45:30,490 --> 01:45:31,710
You could've coached me better.

2506
01:45:31,890 --> 01:45:33,090
Why does it always come down to this?

2507
01:45:36,710 --> 01:45:37,810
This could be...

2508
01:45:38,570 --> 01:45:39,570
This could be legendary.

2509
01:45:39,690 --> 01:45:40,250
You got this, brother.

2510
01:45:40,310 --> 01:45:40,770
Come on, baby.

2511
01:45:40,970 --> 01:45:41,910
I believe in you.

2512
01:45:41,990 --> 01:45:42,970
If I lose, I mean, it's okay.

2513
01:45:42,970 --> 01:45:44,450
It would lose if we rematch them again.

2514
01:45:44,450 --> 01:45:44,910
It's fine.

2515
01:45:44,930 --> 01:45:46,830
Look, real shit, it's fine if you lose.

2516
01:45:46,850 --> 01:45:47,130
No.

2517
01:45:47,650 --> 01:45:49,790
Just treat it like a fucking rank set, bro.

2518
01:45:50,270 --> 01:45:52,970
It's literally ranked and you're just farming points off of my cake.

2519
01:45:53,110 --> 01:45:53,810
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2520
01:45:53,830 --> 01:45:55,310
You bump into him in rank.

2521
01:45:55,650 --> 01:45:56,050
Steve!

2522
01:45:56,110 --> 01:46:00,050
I probably just donated you like a thousand bits and it's just talking to you like it's just any other day.

2523
01:46:00,150 --> 01:46:00,470
Wait, wait, wait.

2524
01:46:00,490 --> 01:46:01,290
He's on Steve?

2525
01:46:02,710 --> 01:46:03,230
Yeah.

2526
01:46:14,920 --> 01:46:15,660
Oh, nice.

2527
01:46:17,160 --> 01:46:18,180
Oh, that's new.

2528
01:46:42,200 --> 01:46:43,240
Oh, nice.

2529
01:46:43,340 --> 01:46:43,640
Oh.

2530
01:46:45,440 --> 01:46:46,380
Oh my god.

2531
01:46:46,480 --> 01:46:46,760
Got it.

2532
01:46:49,300 --> 01:46:49,820
Nice!

2533
01:46:50,140 --> 01:46:50,660
Yeah!

2534
01:46:52,760 --> 01:46:53,260
That's fucking right.

2535
01:46:53,440 --> 01:46:54,360
Round two.

2536
01:46:55,280 --> 01:46:55,840
Fight.

2537
01:47:01,380 --> 01:47:01,940
Oh.

2538
01:47:04,900 --> 01:47:05,600
Bounce him.

2539
01:47:06,760 --> 01:47:07,720
Oh, nice.

2540
01:47:08,140 --> 01:47:08,980
He's in the corner.

2541
01:47:09,820 --> 01:47:10,540
Uh-oh.

2542
01:47:10,540 --> 01:47:11,700
What a combo!

2543
01:47:11,980 --> 01:47:12,260
Steven!

2544
01:47:14,320 --> 01:47:15,940
Throw him that fucking wand!

2545
01:47:18,610 --> 01:47:19,410
He's dead.

2546
01:47:19,570 --> 01:47:19,850
Unbelievable.

2547
01:47:19,910 --> 01:47:21,710
Un-fucking-lievable, dude.

2548
01:47:21,830 --> 01:47:22,610
Oh, he's so good.

2549
01:47:22,750 --> 01:47:23,250
Holy shit!

2550
01:47:23,250 --> 01:47:24,290
All right.

2551
01:47:24,330 --> 01:47:24,850
Okay, okay, okay.

2552
01:47:24,850 --> 01:47:25,650
There we go, baby.

2553
01:47:25,690 --> 01:47:26,870
I was like, isn't that a lepick?

2554
01:47:26,870 --> 01:47:27,710
Oh my goodness.

2555
01:47:28,350 --> 01:47:28,790
Oh.

2556
01:47:30,530 --> 01:47:30,970
Oh.

2557
01:47:33,680 --> 01:47:33,900
Over here.

2558
01:47:34,160 --> 01:47:34,580
Mm.

2559
01:47:34,760 --> 01:47:35,200
Come on.

2560
01:47:35,360 --> 01:47:35,860
Come on.

2561
01:47:36,120 --> 01:47:36,880
He's dead.

2562
01:47:36,880 --> 01:47:37,220
Oh, he's dead.

2563
01:47:37,580 --> 01:47:38,020
Smash.

2564
01:47:38,780 --> 01:47:39,440
It's over.

2565
01:47:39,760 --> 01:47:40,200
Smash.

2566
01:47:48,300 --> 01:47:48,740
Woo!

2567
01:47:48,760 --> 01:47:49,020
Yes!

2568
01:47:49,380 --> 01:47:49,860
That's wall.

2569
01:47:50,140 --> 01:47:50,380
Ooh.

2570
01:47:50,500 --> 01:47:51,980
It's this big into the shins.

2571
01:47:51,980 --> 01:47:52,720
Oh my god.

2572
01:47:52,720 --> 01:47:53,360
That's gonna hurt.

2573
01:47:53,460 --> 01:47:53,580
That's the handles.

2574
01:47:55,300 --> 01:47:55,740
Nice.

2575
01:47:59,660 --> 01:48:00,680
Oh, that's right.

2576
01:48:00,940 --> 01:48:01,740
Oh, wow.

2577
01:48:01,820 --> 01:48:02,460
True, true.

2578
01:48:02,660 --> 01:48:02,880
Yeah.

2579
01:48:02,880 --> 01:48:03,580
Oh, that's crazy.

2580
01:48:03,920 --> 01:48:05,180
Oh my god.

2581
01:48:05,740 --> 01:48:06,880
Oh, that kick missed.

2582
01:48:17,770 --> 01:48:20,050
Oh, you fucking beat his ass, hunk.

2583
01:48:20,710 --> 01:48:21,730
Put him on the wall.

2584
01:48:21,830 --> 01:48:22,570
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2585
01:48:32,730 --> 01:48:34,290
Make sure he never leaves.

2586
01:48:35,870 --> 01:48:36,390
Next!

2587
01:48:37,110 --> 01:48:37,890
Come on.

2588
01:48:38,370 --> 01:48:39,790
Isn't that a big counter hit?

2589
01:48:39,830 --> 01:48:40,210
What else?

2590
01:48:44,390 --> 01:48:45,690
Oh my god.

2591
01:48:45,830 --> 01:48:47,550
Oh my goodness.

2592
01:48:47,990 --> 01:48:48,330
What is that?

2593
01:48:48,330 --> 01:48:49,490
You just rolled it.

2594
01:48:49,530 --> 01:48:49,610
Oh my god.

2595
01:48:49,610 --> 01:48:51,770
Oh my goodness.

2596
01:48:52,790 --> 01:48:56,590
I think there's a reason we're the top team, dude.

2597
01:48:56,670 --> 01:48:57,090
Oh my god.

2598
01:48:57,090 --> 01:48:59,030
I think there's a fucking reason we're the favorites.

2599
01:48:59,510 --> 01:48:59,970
How?

2600
01:49:00,970 --> 01:49:02,650
Oh my god.

2601
01:49:02,850 --> 01:49:04,850
If you taught me that, I could've beat you.

2602
01:49:04,850 --> 01:49:05,830
Spider -Man, push him from the top rope.

2603
01:49:06,790 --> 01:49:08,250
He's like, get off that stage.

2604
01:49:08,330 --> 01:49:09,710
Get off that up-heel-ing mansion.

2605
01:49:10,050 --> 01:49:11,590
He's like, get me out of the king's house.

2606
01:49:11,710 --> 01:49:12,490
I'm changing characters.

2607
01:49:12,830 --> 01:49:12,930
I'm changing characters.

2608
01:49:12,930 --> 01:49:14,630
He's like, you're gonna put me against the wall?

2609
01:49:15,050 --> 01:49:15,870
Big mistake.

2610
01:49:16,130 --> 01:49:16,770
Get me out of that.

2611
01:49:16,790 --> 01:49:17,710
That's king's mansion.

2612
01:49:17,830 --> 01:49:19,070
No, get me out of there.

2613
01:49:19,170 --> 01:49:19,590
Yeah.

2614
01:49:20,170 --> 01:49:21,950
Oh my god, dude.

2615
01:49:22,230 --> 01:49:23,550
The keys to the kingdom.

2616
01:49:23,830 --> 01:49:24,390
Oh my god.

2617
01:49:24,390 --> 01:49:25,170
Oh my god.

2618
01:49:25,210 --> 01:49:26,090
I've never seen that.

2619
01:49:26,250 --> 01:49:28,090
I don't think he's gonna play Steve again.

2620
01:49:30,250 --> 01:49:30,930
Bear time.

2621
01:49:31,130 --> 01:49:31,490
Bear time.

2622
01:49:31,890 --> 01:49:32,590
Dude, you got it.

2623
01:49:32,830 --> 01:49:34,290
Alright, you're on a training ground.

2624
01:49:34,370 --> 01:49:35,090
You got some walls here.

2625
01:49:35,570 --> 01:49:36,150
Mm-hmm.

2626
01:49:36,250 --> 01:49:36,690
Alright.

2627
01:49:36,870 --> 01:49:37,610
Good luck, dude.

2628
01:49:37,930 --> 01:49:38,450
Let's go.

2629
01:49:40,210 --> 01:49:40,650
Bear.

2630
01:49:53,240 --> 01:49:54,440
Wait, what character is this?

2631
01:49:58,710 --> 01:49:59,530
It's a bear.

2632
01:50:00,890 --> 01:50:01,330
It's a bear.

2633
01:50:01,330 --> 01:50:02,470
It's a bear.

2634
01:50:02,470 --> 01:50:02,670
It's a bear.

2635
01:50:02,670 --> 01:50:04,390
Slime, it's time for you to take some notes.

2636
01:50:04,830 --> 01:50:07,110
Okay, not these notes, though, because he's getting destroyed.

2637
01:50:15,240 --> 01:50:15,680
Nice.

2638
01:50:18,940 --> 01:50:19,380
Oh.

2639
01:50:19,420 --> 01:50:19,840
Yes.

2640
01:50:20,060 --> 01:50:20,700
Nice job.

2641
01:50:20,800 --> 01:50:21,240
Nice.

2642
01:50:23,260 --> 01:50:24,360
He's so fucking...

2643
01:50:24,360 --> 01:50:25,340
I mean, he's like...

2644
01:50:25,340 --> 01:50:26,100
Oh my god.

2645
01:50:26,320 --> 01:50:27,180
That's our coach.

2646
01:50:27,540 --> 01:50:27,980
Nice job.

2647
01:50:27,980 --> 01:50:28,840
It's just, it's beautiful.

2648
01:50:29,080 --> 01:50:30,280
The things that I see today.

2649
01:50:30,480 --> 01:50:30,860
Yeah.

2650
01:50:30,900 --> 01:50:31,100
It's gold.

2651
01:50:32,220 --> 01:50:34,600
I lost on purpose so we could see this.

2652
01:50:35,780 --> 01:50:36,980
Is it still worth it?

2653
01:50:37,100 --> 01:50:37,380
Yeah.

2654
01:50:39,120 --> 01:50:40,660
I sandbagged on purpose.

2655
01:50:45,170 --> 01:50:45,950
Good shit.

2656
01:50:46,170 --> 01:50:46,570
Nice.

2657
01:50:56,860 --> 01:50:57,660
Do it again.

2658
01:50:57,940 --> 01:50:58,360
Nice.

2659
01:51:03,440 --> 01:51:04,420
These guys are gaming.

2660
01:51:05,860 --> 01:51:08,660
There's some fucking rock, paper, scissors right now.

2661
01:51:08,900 --> 01:51:10,580
He chose rock and he's winning.

2662
01:51:18,700 --> 01:51:19,780
Any rock mains?

2663
01:51:19,840 --> 01:51:21,040
Oh, rock mains.

2664
01:51:22,740 --> 01:51:24,100
Rock beats everything.

2665
01:51:26,540 --> 01:51:27,620
Let's go, baby.

2666
01:51:32,070 --> 01:51:32,650
Yes.

2667
01:51:34,750 --> 01:51:35,890
Let's fucking go.

2668
01:51:36,050 --> 01:51:37,850
Why can't you just always throw rock?

2669
01:51:38,510 --> 01:51:39,090
Exactly.

2670
01:51:39,430 --> 01:51:39,710
Oh my god, dude.

2671
01:51:39,750 --> 01:51:40,990
Like, what can paper do?

2672
01:51:41,290 --> 01:51:43,170
Rock can just be sharper than paper.

2673
01:51:43,550 --> 01:51:44,170
That's legendary.

2674
01:51:45,690 --> 01:51:47,850
That float was also legendary, honestly.

2675
01:51:47,850 --> 01:51:48,190
Oh.

2676
01:51:51,010 --> 01:51:51,950
Oh my god.

2677
01:51:52,050 --> 01:51:52,830
That punish.

2678
01:51:52,950 --> 01:51:52,990
Oh my god.

2679
01:52:13,610 --> 01:52:16,410
That's the same way you ended it last time.

2680
01:52:16,450 --> 01:52:17,770
Blocked on rock in hopkick.

2681
01:52:17,890 --> 01:52:18,590
Succeeded training.

2682
01:52:18,730 --> 01:52:19,290
Ground punish.

2683
01:52:19,710 --> 01:52:20,750
Oh my god.

2684
01:52:20,750 --> 01:52:21,110
That is...

2685
01:52:22,250 --> 01:52:24,250
That's the exact same way you won.

2686
01:52:24,310 --> 01:52:26,470
You're welcome that I lost and won't get this game.

2687
01:52:26,490 --> 01:52:26,910
He does it every time, Ian.

2688
01:52:27,950 --> 01:52:29,110
He does it every time.

2689
01:52:29,110 --> 01:52:29,270
He does it every time.

2690
01:52:29,290 --> 01:52:29,950
He does it every time.

2691
01:52:30,570 --> 01:52:31,190
He does it every time.

2692
01:52:31,190 --> 01:52:32,290
He dropped his combo off the doria.

2693
01:52:32,410 --> 01:52:33,170
He could've killed him.

2694
01:52:33,250 --> 01:52:34,450
Oh my god.

2695
01:52:34,470 --> 01:52:35,130
He dropped it.

2696
01:52:37,270 --> 01:52:39,190
Swappy stages does nothing.

2697
01:52:39,850 --> 01:52:41,130
Good fucking shit, dude.

2698
01:52:41,150 --> 01:52:41,430
Seriously.

2699
01:52:41,750 --> 01:52:42,210
Unbelievable.

2700
01:52:43,390 --> 01:52:44,710
Nobody does it like him.

2701
01:52:44,790 --> 01:52:45,470
Nobody does it.

2702
01:52:47,170 --> 01:52:48,070
That was sick.

2703
01:52:48,150 --> 01:52:48,730
Oh man.

2704
01:52:48,770 --> 01:52:49,530
My heart is pumping.

2705
01:52:52,590 --> 01:52:55,230
I saw you go for that cheeky exploder.

2706
01:52:55,310 --> 01:52:56,110
I'm like bro thing.

2707
01:52:56,190 --> 01:53:06,610
He's trying to blow him up And did you see how we worked that the Kings gamma howl against the running bear thing?

2708
01:53:06,790 --> 01:53:13,290
Yo, yeah doing that move because King absorbed it and then punched him upside the head Good fucking shit dude.

2709
01:53:13,690 --> 01:53:14,910
Yeah, let's go.

2710
01:53:15,070 --> 01:53:15,630
Let's go.

2711
01:53:15,750 --> 01:53:16,530
Oh my god.

2712
01:53:16,610 --> 01:53:17,470
Let's fucking go.

2713
01:53:17,470 --> 01:53:18,450
So fucking proud of you dude.

2714
01:53:18,650 --> 01:53:19,890
So fucking proud of you.

2715
01:53:19,950 --> 01:53:20,450
Good shit.

2716
01:53:20,610 --> 01:53:21,790
I'm fucking shivering.

2717
01:53:21,910 --> 01:53:25,410
I can't believe we watched that.

2718
01:53:25,430 --> 01:53:26,370
Let us out of here.

2719
01:53:27,110 --> 01:53:28,190
I can't believe it.

2720
01:53:28,210 --> 01:53:29,130
We farmed the content.

2721
01:53:29,330 --> 01:53:30,050
Sejam's happy.

2722
01:53:32,490 --> 01:53:33,690
I'm not happy yet.

2723
01:53:37,190 --> 01:53:38,710
I'm not happy yet.

2724
01:53:41,070 --> 01:53:42,450
I'm bringing up the other match.

2725
01:53:42,530 --> 01:53:42,930
Let me see.

2726
01:53:43,350 --> 01:53:44,570
Alright, I got it.

2727
01:53:44,750 --> 01:53:45,650
Oh my god.

2728
01:53:46,930 --> 01:53:48,290
Piss it all out.

2729
01:53:48,950 --> 01:53:50,770
And then we play against Tone.

2730
01:53:51,790 --> 01:53:53,130
FD just beat boxbox.

2731
01:53:53,150 --> 01:53:54,870
You know, you're on the way Brawl Pro.

2732
01:53:55,030 --> 01:53:56,910
Dude, everything's going to coach's match.

2733
01:53:57,130 --> 01:53:57,730
This one is too.

2734
01:53:58,370 --> 01:54:00,850
This slam is so much more fucking scary.

2735
01:54:03,450 --> 01:54:05,690
The teams are a little too close.

2736
01:54:06,210 --> 01:54:06,850
They are.

2737
01:54:07,090 --> 01:54:07,990
Oh my god.

2738
01:54:08,710 --> 01:54:09,730
He's just bringing it up.

2739
01:54:09,770 --> 01:54:10,970
I don't know if it's like nerves or anything.

2740
01:54:11,430 --> 01:54:12,730
But like, holy shit.

2741
01:54:14,210 --> 01:54:16,890
Who won against Tone and V?

2742
01:54:17,690 --> 01:54:18,570
Probably Tone.

2743
01:54:18,770 --> 01:54:20,410
Oh, they're about to play right now.

2744
01:54:20,590 --> 01:54:20,890
Oh shit.

2745
01:54:21,530 --> 01:54:22,410
Oh wow.

2746
01:54:22,810 --> 01:54:25,230
Oh, so we are streaming that.

2747
01:54:25,430 --> 01:54:26,470
So they were just watching us.

2748
01:54:26,670 --> 01:54:27,270
Were we on stream?

2749
01:54:27,910 --> 01:54:28,510
Were we?

2750
01:54:29,030 --> 01:54:30,230
I fucking hope so.

2751
01:54:31,210 --> 01:54:34,350
I hope the people get to look at what just occurred.

2752
01:54:34,350 --> 01:54:37,230
No, it was Signify versus Boxbox on stream.

2753
01:54:38,130 --> 01:54:38,690
Oh, okay.

2754
01:54:38,710 --> 01:54:38,990
Okay, okay.

2755
01:54:40,310 --> 01:54:44,830
I guess I'll restream Boxbox's POV.

2756
01:54:44,910 --> 01:54:46,670
Oh my god, this should have been streamed.

2757
01:54:47,890 --> 01:54:49,410
Yeah, I don't know what they were cooking.

2758
01:54:49,510 --> 01:54:50,450
What were they thinking?

2759
01:54:50,450 --> 01:54:50,510
But they got fucked.

2760
01:54:50,510 --> 01:54:52,210
Yeah, how much we were fucking doing.

2761
01:54:52,650 --> 01:54:53,890
Oh my god.

2762
01:54:54,870 --> 01:54:55,910
That was crazy.

2763
01:54:55,950 --> 01:54:57,350
I would like Tony to lose.

2764
01:54:57,990 --> 01:55:02,210
Actually, both of these guys have speedkicks coaching them how to beat me.

2765
01:55:02,270 --> 01:55:02,890
And it's annoying.

2766
01:55:04,350 --> 01:55:06,230
It doesn't even matter who wins.

2767
01:55:06,230 --> 01:55:07,950
What do they have against you?

2768
01:55:08,070 --> 01:55:09,150
What did you do to them?

2769
01:55:09,950 --> 01:55:11,330
I beat them day one.

2770
01:55:13,810 --> 01:55:15,490
Dude, they're all talking mad shit.

2771
01:55:15,630 --> 01:55:17,170
They're like, blood loss to Raiditz.

2772
01:55:17,230 --> 01:55:19,150
And then everyone else lost to Raiditz.

2773
01:55:19,270 --> 01:55:20,170
And it's like, dude...

2774
01:55:20,170 --> 01:55:20,850
Oh, no, no, no.

2775
01:55:20,950 --> 01:55:21,750
Kaiser, Kaiser.

2776
01:55:22,110 --> 01:55:23,130
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2777
01:55:24,170 --> 01:55:27,330
Tony was like, yeah, he was giving me shit for losing to Kaiser.

2778
01:55:27,450 --> 01:55:28,610
And he gets too owed.

2779
01:55:30,070 --> 01:55:31,830
And Kaiser's like, what did you say fuck me for?

2780
01:55:32,630 --> 01:55:32,990
Yeah.

2781
01:55:35,210 --> 01:55:36,090
Oh my.

2782
01:55:37,990 --> 01:55:41,450
Actually the most nerve-wracking games so far.

2783
01:55:42,350 --> 01:55:43,790
I miss round robins.

2784
01:55:44,510 --> 01:55:46,950
I want Tony to win because I want the Josh run back.

2785
01:55:47,710 --> 01:55:48,150
Sure.

2786
01:55:48,310 --> 01:55:48,810
Yeah, true.

2787
01:55:49,370 --> 01:55:50,090
Fair enough.

2788
01:55:50,350 --> 01:55:51,170
Tony did win.

2789
01:55:51,310 --> 01:55:52,030
I just checked the bot.

2790
01:55:54,610 --> 01:55:55,250
Tony won?

2791
01:55:55,510 --> 01:55:56,610
The coach match.

2792
01:55:56,770 --> 01:55:58,350
The coach match is going on right now.

2793
01:55:58,550 --> 01:55:59,970
Yeah, yeah, it's a coach match.

2794
01:56:03,950 --> 01:56:05,190
Who do we want to win?

2795
01:56:05,330 --> 01:56:06,090
Fi or Tone?

2796
01:56:06,550 --> 01:56:08,410
I think we want Fi to win.

2797
01:56:08,670 --> 01:56:10,230
Because Tone's the strongest.

2798
01:56:10,410 --> 01:56:11,130
I think it's easier, yeah.

2799
01:56:11,390 --> 01:56:13,550
It's way easier for us if Fi wins.

2800
01:56:14,530 --> 01:56:17,450
Like, without, you know, respectfully, Kat is new.

2801
01:56:17,530 --> 01:56:19,630
Tony's team is pretty annoying.

2802
01:56:19,850 --> 01:56:21,410
Like, that's the ESAM team, I think, right?

2803
01:56:21,610 --> 01:56:22,170
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2804
01:56:22,250 --> 01:56:22,850
Tone's the ESAM team.

2805
01:56:23,110 --> 01:56:25,610
Literally no offense, Doki, but ESAM will smoke every person.

2806
01:56:25,610 --> 01:56:27,150
No, 100%.

2807
01:56:27,150 --> 01:56:27,910
I agree.

2808
01:56:28,730 --> 01:56:30,490
By definition, we want Fi to win.

2809
01:56:30,490 --> 01:56:32,970
Because that doesn't mean that they get a guaranteed one win, you know?

2810
01:56:33,030 --> 01:56:33,230
Yeah.

2811
01:56:33,770 --> 01:56:35,190
And it's about to fucking happen.

2812
01:56:35,310 --> 01:56:35,810
Oh my god.

2813
01:56:35,970 --> 01:56:36,930
Let's fucking go, Fi!

2814
01:56:38,090 --> 01:56:39,490
It's 2-2 right now!

2815
01:56:40,170 --> 01:56:41,010
10-fit combo.

2816
01:56:41,650 --> 01:56:42,450
Hollywood, FiDX.

2817
01:56:43,550 --> 01:56:45,010
Guys, you guys want to watch it?

2818
01:56:45,110 --> 01:56:50,830
ESAM is auto 1-0, and then Raidit's fucked me up, and like, you know, drag is a huge issue for me, so...

2819
01:56:50,830 --> 01:56:51,370
Nice!

2820
01:56:52,230 --> 01:56:54,330
We're watching the Fi match right now, chat.

2821
01:56:54,370 --> 01:56:55,150
He's cooking this, man, dude.

2822
01:56:55,910 --> 01:56:57,730
Oh my god, Fi!

2823
01:56:57,730 --> 01:56:59,310
Fi's downloaded him!

2824
01:56:59,670 --> 01:56:59,750
Good outs!

2825
01:57:01,270 --> 01:57:02,310
Oh, that should've worked.

2826
01:57:02,310 --> 01:57:03,830
Oh my god!

2827
01:57:05,830 --> 01:57:08,410
That perfect 1-0!

2828
01:57:08,990 --> 01:57:10,330
With the cat, Drew!

2829
01:57:15,160 --> 01:57:17,020
That was a crazy counter hit.

2830
01:57:17,240 --> 01:57:18,720
Wait, but then if like...

2831
01:57:18,720 --> 01:57:20,160
Okay, but like...

2832
01:57:20,160 --> 01:57:24,960
That means Tone would be in loser bracket, so we might play against Tone if Fi beats us.

2833
01:57:25,480 --> 01:57:26,140
Yeah, definitely.

2834
01:57:26,640 --> 01:57:28,580
If they lose, we could still play him again, yeah.

2835
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:31,000
But we would rather fight Fi than...

2836
01:57:31,020 --> 01:57:32,440
Fi to get into Grants.

2837
01:57:32,480 --> 01:57:33,060
Yeah, okay.

2838
01:57:33,560 --> 01:57:35,580
We'd rather get that, cause then we...

2839
01:57:35,580 --> 01:57:37,360
So right now we're guaranteed at least third.

2840
01:57:37,580 --> 01:57:39,520
If we win again, we're guaranteed second.

2841
01:57:39,760 --> 01:57:42,880
Which means if we win one more set, we go to EVO.

2842
01:57:43,040 --> 01:57:43,740
Uh, theoretically.

2843
01:57:44,420 --> 01:57:45,920
No one cancels out, dude.

2844
01:57:46,220 --> 01:57:48,600
If you win, then take your tickets away!

2845
01:57:48,600 --> 01:57:49,580
If you win, then take your tickets away!

2846
01:57:49,600 --> 01:57:50,280
We all stay home.

2847
01:57:57,400 --> 01:57:58,280
Oh, MaV!

2848
01:58:00,500 --> 01:58:02,020
So we really want Fi to win.

2849
01:58:02,860 --> 01:58:03,080
Alright.

2850
01:58:04,020 --> 01:58:04,460
Oh

2851
01:58:11,020 --> 01:58:12,580
wow, that's a full combo.

2852
01:58:12,860 --> 01:58:13,280
Nice.

2853
01:58:18,530 --> 01:58:19,330
Dude, Lili's...

2854
01:58:19,330 --> 01:58:20,250
Oh, what a man.

2855
01:58:20,530 --> 01:58:22,150
Dude, Lili is fucking insane.

2856
01:58:23,270 --> 01:58:26,210
I think the damage is just absurdly high on her.

2857
01:58:26,990 --> 01:58:28,970
That's the EVO Japan character, man.

2858
01:58:29,210 --> 01:58:32,090
Was Fi sandbagging and turning round robins?

2859
01:58:32,150 --> 01:58:32,750
Like, what?

2860
01:58:32,810 --> 01:58:33,650
Where was this?

2861
01:58:33,870 --> 01:58:35,870
He just analyzed and studied.

2862
01:58:35,970 --> 01:58:36,770
Oh, okay.

2863
01:58:36,990 --> 01:58:38,290
I was like, where the fuck was this?

2864
01:58:38,890 --> 01:58:41,230
This is, you know, just kind of a read on my part.

2865
01:58:41,330 --> 01:58:42,490
I get the vibe Fi is...

2866
01:58:43,450 --> 01:58:43,930
very...

2867
01:58:44,950 --> 01:58:46,490
anxious about his...

2868
01:58:46,490 --> 01:58:48,290
Because he's the Tekken YouTube guy.

2869
01:58:48,510 --> 01:58:51,110
And if he doesn't perform, he thinks people are gonna care about that.

2870
01:58:51,230 --> 01:58:53,190
Like, oh, if you're so good, why aren't you...

2871
01:58:53,190 --> 01:58:53,690
You know what I mean?

2872
01:58:53,830 --> 01:58:55,230
I think he takes that seriously.

2873
01:58:55,750 --> 01:58:57,850
He hasn't learned...

2874
01:58:57,850 --> 01:59:01,550
He hasn't fully embraced the skill of don't look at comments yet.

2875
01:59:02,090 --> 01:59:02,670
It's hard.

2876
01:59:03,090 --> 01:59:04,350
It is hard.

2877
01:59:04,550 --> 01:59:07,230
You can revel in it.

2878
01:59:07,370 --> 01:59:07,990
You can get lost.

2879
01:59:08,370 --> 01:59:09,450
Also, sponsor curse.

2880
01:59:09,450 --> 01:59:10,410
Sponsor curse.

2881
01:59:10,510 --> 01:59:10,630
True.

2882
01:59:11,730 --> 01:59:13,790
He just got sponsored too.

2883
01:59:13,990 --> 01:59:14,710
Like, everyone's looking.

2884
01:59:15,590 --> 01:59:17,370
Wait, who did he get sponsored by?

2885
01:59:18,350 --> 01:59:18,830
DSP?

2886
01:59:19,210 --> 01:59:20,870
Yeah, this guy's Toku.

2887
01:59:20,910 --> 01:59:21,350
Oh!

2888
01:59:24,210 --> 01:59:27,650
He got to 100k within 4 or 5 months.

2889
01:59:27,870 --> 01:59:30,690
That's why it was maybe hard to get used to all the comments.

2890
01:59:30,810 --> 01:59:31,290
Yeah.

2891
01:59:33,130 --> 01:59:35,990
It's something everyone who kind of blows up has to learn.

2892
01:59:38,830 --> 01:59:40,170
Unless you're already in the know.

2893
01:59:40,170 --> 01:59:41,070
Just turn off the monitor.

2894
01:59:41,650 --> 01:59:43,050
Oh my god.

2895
01:59:43,990 --> 01:59:44,510
Good block!

2896
01:59:45,690 --> 01:59:47,730
Tone's been analyzing the wrong coach.

2897
01:59:47,850 --> 01:59:48,430
Oh my god.

2898
01:59:48,430 --> 01:59:49,670
Tone's fucking desperate.

2899
01:59:49,910 --> 01:59:52,670
I mean, he did a 1-2-4 there too.

2900
01:59:52,750 --> 01:59:53,430
You could've ducked it.

2901
01:59:53,950 --> 01:59:54,690
Good shit.

2902
01:59:54,770 --> 01:59:55,010
One more.

2903
01:59:55,070 --> 01:59:55,430
Nice!

2904
01:59:56,270 --> 01:59:59,210
Why is Lily allergic to this glowing Bryan?

2905
02:00:01,830 --> 02:00:03,190
Oh my god.

2906
02:00:03,230 --> 02:00:04,250
Oh, that's gonna break the floor.

2907
02:00:11,440 --> 02:00:12,220
Come on, Fii.

2908
02:00:12,260 --> 02:00:12,680
One more.

2909
02:00:12,940 --> 02:00:13,160
Come on, Fii.

2910
02:00:13,160 --> 02:00:13,160
One more.

2911
02:00:14,620 --> 02:00:15,620
Tone with the wall is so scary, dude.

2912
02:00:15,620 --> 02:00:16,280
Oh, that was a jet upper.

2913
02:00:16,300 --> 02:00:16,900
He fucked up.

2914
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:17,800
He could've won.

2915
02:00:19,960 --> 02:00:21,720
No, these guys have a lot of pressure too.

2916
02:00:22,100 --> 02:00:22,840
Yeah, they're scared.

2917
02:00:24,540 --> 02:00:25,920
I'll say no matter what.

2918
02:00:26,520 --> 02:00:29,580
Tone's like the super top seed, so he's got all the eyes on him.

2919
02:00:29,660 --> 02:00:32,200
And I think Tone wants to win this more than anybody else.

2920
02:00:32,780 --> 02:00:34,560
Yeah, he wanted me on his team and shit.

2921
02:00:34,680 --> 02:00:36,660
He was like, hey Matt, you wanna fucking...

2922
02:00:37,040 --> 02:00:39,040
Why does Tone wanna win so badly?

2923
02:00:39,660 --> 02:00:43,940
I was hanging out in his Twitch chat and he was like, yo, you wanna be part of my team?

2924
02:00:44,220 --> 02:00:45,260
I was like, uh...

2925
02:00:45,260 --> 02:00:47,800
He tried to poach you from the team?

2926
02:00:47,900 --> 02:00:48,580
Oh my god!

2927
02:00:49,060 --> 02:00:51,360
If he was trying to poach, he should've offered money.

2928
02:00:52,120 --> 02:00:53,440
I mean, respect, but like...

2929
02:00:54,160 --> 02:00:55,360
It's respect, for sure.

2930
02:00:56,580 --> 02:00:57,540
You're a commodity.

2931
02:00:58,160 --> 02:00:59,840
Yeah, you should've taken bribes.

2932
02:00:59,840 --> 02:01:00,520
You're a hot commodity.

2933
02:01:00,540 --> 02:01:00,960
I'm a free agent.

2934
02:01:01,140 --> 02:01:02,700
Bro is Otani of the slims.

2935
02:01:05,480 --> 02:01:06,520
Sign him up.

2936
02:01:07,860 --> 02:01:08,720
Oh my god.

2937
02:01:08,720 --> 02:01:09,660
Heat battle, heat battle.

2938
02:01:09,900 --> 02:01:10,940
Is this captain left?

2939
02:01:11,400 --> 02:01:12,660
Oh my fucking god!

2940
02:01:12,780 --> 02:01:14,200
Did he do it?

2941
02:01:14,300 --> 02:01:14,820
No way!

2942
02:01:18,020 --> 02:01:19,500
Oh my god!

2943
02:01:19,740 --> 02:01:20,720
That's so close!

2944
02:01:21,920 --> 02:01:23,940
Fuck, man.

2945
02:01:23,960 --> 02:01:25,480
Fiend needs to win for us, man.

2946
02:01:26,240 --> 02:01:26,720
Yeah.

2947
02:01:27,760 --> 02:01:28,980
Oh my god.

2948
02:01:30,340 --> 02:01:30,820
Yo.

2949
02:01:32,680 --> 02:01:34,680
Why are the slims so close though?

2950
02:01:36,960 --> 02:01:40,000
Dude, every game going to coach match, bro.

2951
02:01:40,180 --> 02:01:40,600
Yeah.

2952
02:01:40,600 --> 02:01:41,300
This is insane.

2953
02:01:41,540 --> 02:01:44,300
Coach match, final finals, like, except for you, you dominated.

2954
02:01:45,120 --> 02:01:45,620
No, that would be stupid.

2955
02:01:47,060 --> 02:01:50,320
If it's a coach match to get first, that would be dumb.

2956
02:01:50,480 --> 02:01:51,420
I would just walk off.

2957
02:01:53,440 --> 02:01:54,540
Y'all got it.

2958
02:01:54,700 --> 02:01:56,500
I'm not putting myself through that.

2959
02:01:56,680 --> 02:01:56,880
What?

2960
02:01:57,240 --> 02:01:58,240
Not for me?

2961
02:01:59,300 --> 02:02:00,460
For my ticket!

2962
02:02:01,980 --> 02:02:05,200
Guys, coach doesn't care.

2963
02:02:05,820 --> 02:02:06,440
Is this tournament rules just a rant?

2964
02:02:06,520 --> 02:02:07,360
Is this a random stage selection?

2965
02:02:07,800 --> 02:02:09,280
Yeah, that's TWT rules.

2966
02:02:09,440 --> 02:02:10,380
You can't counter pick stage.

2967
02:02:10,600 --> 02:02:11,240
It has to be random.

2968
02:02:11,520 --> 02:02:12,300
That's insane.

2969
02:02:13,320 --> 02:02:15,640
As a Smash player, that's absurd.

2970
02:02:16,060 --> 02:02:16,380
Yeah.

2971
02:02:17,460 --> 02:02:18,480
That's what I was going to say.

2972
02:02:18,860 --> 02:02:19,820
Because of you two.

2973
02:02:20,860 --> 02:02:24,660
But then again, Kony, Jack8 and Big Guy, good at the game.

2974
02:02:25,340 --> 02:02:26,460
Yeah, it's a different world.

2975
02:02:26,480 --> 02:02:27,500
I'm all adapting now.

2976
02:02:27,500 --> 02:02:27,960
He's my boss.

2977
02:02:30,900 --> 02:02:32,460
Fiend's playing mad defensive now.

2978
02:02:33,020 --> 02:02:33,620
Oh, man.

2979
02:02:34,340 --> 02:02:34,800
Fuck.

2980
02:02:34,960 --> 02:02:35,600
Oh my god.

2981
02:02:35,620 --> 02:02:36,500
This is so nerve-wracking.

2982
02:02:36,520 --> 02:02:38,640
I'm watching this and I'm scared.

2983
02:02:38,760 --> 02:02:40,240
Yeah, I'm not slaying.

2984
02:02:40,440 --> 02:02:40,960
Yeah.

2985
02:02:41,560 --> 02:02:42,780
Imagine how they feel.

2986
02:02:44,380 --> 02:02:46,700
Look, Fiend needs to duck that 1-2-4.

2987
02:02:46,820 --> 02:02:47,820
Tony keeps spamming.

2988
02:02:48,540 --> 02:02:49,060
Nice.

2989
02:02:53,110 --> 02:02:54,250
Oh, he's dead.

2990
02:02:54,410 --> 02:02:54,790
No!

2991
02:02:55,090 --> 02:02:57,770
He's panicking.

2992
02:02:57,910 --> 02:02:58,430
No!

2993
02:02:58,430 --> 02:02:58,830
Really?

2994
02:03:01,910 --> 02:03:02,590
Damn it.

2995
02:03:02,630 --> 02:03:04,950
They're making mistakes now.

2996
02:03:05,350 --> 02:03:06,110
They're scared.

2997
02:03:06,210 --> 02:03:07,130
Lock in, Fiend.

2998
02:03:07,150 --> 02:03:08,010
Lock in, dude.

2999
02:03:08,850 --> 02:03:11,850
How long you've been playing, how professional you are, nerves will change.

3000
02:03:11,930 --> 02:03:12,710
Oh, man.

3001
02:03:19,040 --> 02:03:19,520
Nice.

3002
02:03:21,100 --> 02:03:22,120
Oh my god.

3003
02:03:22,180 --> 02:03:22,860
Why is that hitting?

3004
02:03:29,980 --> 02:03:30,640
Oh, no.

3005
02:03:30,780 --> 02:03:32,320
This might be a done deal.

3006
02:03:32,420 --> 02:03:33,340
Oh, I think...

3007
02:03:33,340 --> 02:03:35,560
He's playing so defensively now.

3008
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:38,580
I think when he's like...

3009
02:03:38,580 --> 02:03:41,400
kind of tilted, he reverts back to Tekken 7 style.

3010
02:03:42,140 --> 02:03:43,340
What's Tekken 7 style?

3011
02:03:43,800 --> 02:03:45,660
Very defensive, back dashing.

3012
02:03:46,120 --> 02:03:47,140
Tekken 8 is very aggressive.

3013
02:03:47,160 --> 02:03:49,400
You have to go in if you want to win.

3014
02:03:50,140 --> 02:03:50,620
Nice.

3015
02:03:50,800 --> 02:03:51,700
Counter hit Fiend.

3016
02:03:51,760 --> 02:03:52,880
Let's fucking go, dude.

3017
02:03:53,060 --> 02:03:53,300
Oh.

3018
02:03:56,960 --> 02:03:57,440
Voila.

3019
02:03:58,600 --> 02:03:59,080
Oh!

3020
02:03:59,860 --> 02:04:00,340
Oh!

3021
02:04:00,440 --> 02:04:01,160
Cook this man!

3022
02:04:01,380 --> 02:04:03,320
Oh, that is minus 13.

3023
02:04:03,520 --> 02:04:04,400
Punish that, Fiend.

3024
02:04:07,020 --> 02:04:08,160
Okay, nice power crush.

3025
02:04:08,380 --> 02:04:09,920
It ain't over till it's over.

3026
02:04:09,920 --> 02:04:10,860
Bring it back.

3027
02:04:11,160 --> 02:04:14,220
I cannot imagine what their team is going through right now.

3028
02:04:14,220 --> 02:04:14,500
Yeah.

3029
02:04:16,260 --> 02:04:18,360
This rock, paper, scissors, man.

3030
02:04:21,640 --> 02:04:22,120
No.

3031
02:04:22,360 --> 02:04:22,780
No.

3032
02:04:23,300 --> 02:04:25,320
Tone is winning the rock, paper, scissors.

3033
02:04:26,380 --> 02:04:28,000
Oh, my fucking god.

3034
02:04:29,940 --> 02:04:30,440
Oh, my fucking god.

3035
02:04:30,440 --> 02:04:30,840
I'm so scared.

3036
02:04:30,900 --> 02:04:32,540
Oh, my fucking god.

3037
02:04:32,620 --> 02:04:33,700
I want to close my eyes.

3038
02:04:34,420 --> 02:04:35,400
I'm closing my eyes.

3039
02:04:36,500 --> 02:04:37,160
It's over.

3040
02:04:37,280 --> 02:04:37,960
If he didn't punish...

3041
02:04:38,440 --> 02:04:38,680
No!

3042
02:04:39,980 --> 02:04:42,720
If he didn't punish that, he's going to tilt himself.

3043
02:04:42,980 --> 02:04:43,900
He needs to get away from the wall.

3044
02:04:44,500 --> 02:04:45,040
It's over, GG.

3045
02:04:45,240 --> 02:04:45,640
It's over.

3046
02:04:46,920 --> 02:04:47,400
That's it.

3047
02:04:47,780 --> 02:04:49,060
Goodbye, Fee.

3048
02:04:49,860 --> 02:04:50,260
Goodbye.

3049
02:04:52,780 --> 02:04:53,180
Okay.

3050
02:04:53,860 --> 02:04:55,480
Well, time to fight Tone.

3051
02:04:55,780 --> 02:05:00,980
Well, all that means is that we get smoked by Tony's team and then we fight FeeDX's team and lose next time.

3052
02:05:01,120 --> 02:05:03,720
Wait a minute.

3053
02:05:03,860 --> 02:05:04,420
Hold on.

3054
02:05:04,600 --> 02:05:05,180
We could win.

3055
02:05:05,780 --> 02:05:07,560
We need some... Oh, god.

3056
02:05:08,860 --> 02:05:09,780
We're in need of a vehicle, man.

3057
02:05:09,780 --> 02:05:11,000
He said, oh, god.

3058
02:05:11,240 --> 02:05:12,200
Oh, god.

3059
02:05:15,020 --> 02:05:15,740
I see.

3060
02:05:16,040 --> 02:05:19,080
Brian is cheap as fuck, dude.

3061
02:05:19,180 --> 02:05:19,820
At the wall.

3062
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:20,720
Oh, my god.

3063
02:05:20,960 --> 02:05:21,940
Oh, my god.

3064
02:05:22,020 --> 02:05:23,120
This is truly...

3065
02:05:24,260 --> 02:05:25,380
so nerve-wracking.

3066
02:05:26,960 --> 02:05:28,480
Hey, we got at least third, though.

3067
02:05:28,560 --> 02:05:29,060
That's big.

3068
02:05:29,300 --> 02:05:30,260
Yeah, that's pretty good.

3069
02:05:30,600 --> 02:05:31,200
Hey, I'm...

3070
02:05:31,980 --> 02:05:38,620
I told BrawlPro last night, we were talking, I was like, as long as I do my job, like, I can... that's all I can focus on, right?

3071
02:05:38,700 --> 02:05:40,020
All we can focus on are our sets.

3072
02:05:40,200 --> 02:05:44,560
And obviously, we want to win for everybody, but it's like, all you can do is work it about your game.

3073
02:05:44,660 --> 02:05:45,160
You know what I mean?

3074
02:05:45,220 --> 02:05:46,360
We're trying to do it as a team.

3075
02:05:46,560 --> 02:05:47,980
So... For real?

3076
02:05:48,080 --> 02:05:48,360
For real?

3077
02:05:48,360 --> 02:05:49,360
We all gotta do it together.

3078
02:05:51,780 --> 02:05:52,180
Yeah.

3079
02:05:54,560 --> 02:05:56,920
Do we get, like, an intermission going straight in?

3080
02:05:58,140 --> 02:05:58,820
I don't know.

3081
02:05:58,960 --> 02:06:00,940
I'mma tell them, let us run to the bathroom.

3082
02:06:01,160 --> 02:06:02,580
Because I'm at the ghost at NYK's.

3083
02:06:03,480 --> 02:06:05,340
But I wanted to watch that set.

3084
02:06:05,520 --> 02:06:06,600
I'm about to piss his pants.

3085
02:06:07,200 --> 02:06:07,600
Oh.

3086
02:06:09,060 --> 02:06:09,460
Oh.

3087
02:06:09,460 --> 02:06:13,140
Oh, they are going to the losers right now, on the mainstream though.

3088
02:06:13,300 --> 02:06:13,600
Oh.

3089
02:06:14,660 --> 02:06:18,140
So we're most likely, we might have to join the lobby soon.

3090
02:06:20,360 --> 02:06:20,900
Yeah.

3091
02:06:24,650 --> 02:06:25,030
Oh.

3092
02:06:25,930 --> 02:06:26,370
Oh.

3093
02:06:27,970 --> 02:06:29,370
I don't even play Tekken.

3094
02:06:29,370 --> 02:06:29,790
Four straight coach matches.

3095
02:06:29,790 --> 02:06:29,930
I don't even play Tekken.

3096
02:06:30,110 --> 02:06:30,370
Four straight coach matches.

3097
02:06:30,450 --> 02:06:31,390
I'm just as nervous.

3098
02:06:36,360 --> 02:06:36,900
Oh.

3099
02:06:39,280 --> 02:06:39,820
Damn.

3100
02:06:41,960 --> 02:06:43,200
I'm freaking it.

3101
02:06:43,320 --> 02:06:43,600
I'm freaking it.

3102
02:06:46,640 --> 02:06:48,620
Alright, I will be right back, fellas.

3103
02:06:53,070 --> 02:06:53,670
Alright, I will be right back, fellas.

3104
02:06:53,670 --> 02:06:54,270
Oh my god.

3105
02:06:54,350 --> 02:06:55,610
That was so nervous.

3106
02:06:55,750 --> 02:06:56,810
I think, like...

3107
02:06:56,810 --> 02:06:59,990
I think I definitely, like...

3108
02:06:59,990 --> 02:07:03,970
Against Gumi, I definitely hesitated so much.

3109
02:07:04,190 --> 02:07:06,190
Because I started thinking too much.

3110
02:07:06,410 --> 02:07:08,110
I think it's because, like...

3111
02:07:08,790 --> 02:07:09,390
Uh...

3112
02:07:09,990 --> 02:07:10,590
Uh...

3113
02:07:10,590 --> 02:07:12,510
I was, like...

3114
02:07:12,510 --> 02:07:15,870
I was just thinking too much in that last game.

3115
02:07:16,210 --> 02:07:17,370
And then, yeah.

3116
02:07:18,190 --> 02:07:18,750
I got into my own head.

3117
02:07:19,110 --> 02:07:24,350
I got into my own head.

3118
02:07:24,510 --> 02:07:24,630
I got into my own head.

3119
02:07:24,630 --> 02:07:25,330
And I fucked up.

3120
02:07:25,510 --> 02:07:25,710
Yeah.

3121
02:07:26,610 --> 02:07:29,130
I kept thinking about block, block, block.

3122
02:07:29,310 --> 02:07:31,310
So then I forgot how to be aggressive.

3123
02:07:32,290 --> 02:07:34,990
Because, like, that's how I won rounds.

3124
02:07:35,230 --> 02:07:36,810
When I was more aggressive.

3125
02:07:37,290 --> 02:07:38,630
But, oh my god.

3126
02:07:38,850 --> 02:07:39,610
I was, like...

3127
02:07:39,610 --> 02:07:41,930
I was too nervous there.

3128
02:07:42,390 --> 02:07:42,870
Yeah.

3129
02:07:43,110 --> 02:07:44,090
I just gotta relax.

3130
02:07:44,090 --> 02:07:44,810
My hands...

3131
02:07:44,810 --> 02:07:46,950
My fingers during the round robins...

3132
02:07:46,950 --> 02:07:48,870
My fingers never shook.

3133
02:07:49,330 --> 02:07:50,330
I was so, like...

3134
02:07:50,330 --> 02:07:54,010
I was technically, like, relaxed during the round robins.

3135
02:07:54,170 --> 02:07:56,260
But this is, like, the first time...

3136
02:07:56,610 --> 02:07:58,550
My hands actually were shaking.

3137
02:07:58,830 --> 02:07:59,290
Like...

3138
02:08:02,730 --> 02:08:05,630
I was actually shaking.

3139
02:08:05,810 --> 02:08:06,890
And I was, like...

3140
02:08:08,030 --> 02:08:08,690
Yeah.

3141
02:08:10,150 --> 02:08:10,730
Yeah.

3142
02:08:10,870 --> 02:08:12,610
The pressure got to me.

3143
02:08:12,790 --> 02:08:13,470
But, like...

3144
02:08:14,650 --> 02:08:15,950
It was still close.

3145
02:08:16,230 --> 02:08:17,190
It was still close.

3146
02:08:17,290 --> 02:08:20,130
I just ended up, like, not punishing or doing damage.

3147
02:08:20,510 --> 02:08:22,010
I got defense.

3148
02:08:22,150 --> 02:08:22,950
I defended.

3149
02:08:23,230 --> 02:08:26,070
But I didn't do anything after defending.

3150
02:08:26,390 --> 02:08:26,830
But!

3151
02:08:27,810 --> 02:08:32,090
Maybe I purposely lost so we can get that sick-ass brawl pro match.

3152
02:08:32,330 --> 02:08:32,850
I don't know.

3153
02:08:35,050 --> 02:08:36,170
If I...

3154
02:08:36,170 --> 02:08:37,650
If I won...

3155
02:08:37,650 --> 02:08:40,590
We wouldn't have saw the match we saw today.

3156
02:08:40,990 --> 02:08:41,810
I'm just saying.

3157
02:08:42,010 --> 02:08:42,570
Guys.

3158
02:08:42,690 --> 02:08:43,550
I'm just saying.

3159
02:08:43,690 --> 02:08:47,590
We wouldn't have been able to see some sick-ass Tekken if we...

3160
02:08:48,830 --> 02:08:49,470
The...

3161
02:08:50,110 --> 02:08:51,830
The wall jumps and everything?

3162
02:08:52,130 --> 02:08:52,850
Come on!

3163
02:08:54,250 --> 02:08:57,050
We wouldn't have that content, guys.

3164
02:08:57,250 --> 02:08:58,250
It was fate.

3165
02:08:58,410 --> 02:08:58,770
Yeah.

3166
02:08:59,310 --> 02:09:04,470
I sandbagged so we could see that sick-ass Tekken.

3167
02:09:04,850 --> 02:09:06,150
I sandbagged so we could see that sick-ass Tekken.

3168
02:09:08,550 --> 02:09:10,890
That wall jump was fucking sick!

3169
02:09:11,150 --> 02:09:12,010
Come on, guys!

3170
02:09:12,350 --> 02:09:14,150
If I won, we wouldn't see that.

3171
02:09:15,810 --> 02:09:17,430
It was for the content.

3172
02:09:19,710 --> 02:09:20,910
Focus on trying to win.

3173
02:09:20,970 --> 02:09:21,590
Okay, guys.

3174
02:09:21,610 --> 02:09:23,230
We're not winning against ESAM.

3175
02:09:23,790 --> 02:09:25,750
I'm like the resident punching bag.

3176
02:09:29,490 --> 02:09:32,150
I'm the punching bag for the team.

3177
02:09:32,370 --> 02:09:33,350
Like, we're not...

3178
02:09:33,350 --> 02:09:33,990
Bro!

3179
02:09:34,270 --> 02:09:35,530
ESAM is a fucking...

3180
02:09:35,530 --> 02:09:36,150
Who the fuck is ESAM?

3181
02:09:36,170 --> 02:09:40,350
Fuck, let this fucking Super Smash Bros Pro play fourth seed.

3182
02:09:40,650 --> 02:09:43,690
Like, who the fuck allowed this to happen?

3183
02:09:46,910 --> 02:09:51,210
This person is a Smash Bros Pro player.

3184
02:09:57,310 --> 02:09:59,370
It's just Smash.

3185
02:10:00,530 --> 02:10:02,510
Just think it's right.

3186
02:10:02,850 --> 02:10:05,250
Oh, do the cheesy stuff I do in ranked.

3187
02:10:06,170 --> 02:10:08,130
Bro, I hate playing against Laws.

3188
02:10:08,130 --> 02:10:10,450
Hey, did we lose matches first before our match?

3189
02:10:10,590 --> 02:10:11,230
I thought they...

3190
02:10:11,230 --> 02:10:12,290
So, we got a little...

3191
02:10:12,290 --> 02:10:15,410
Oh, there you go.

3192
02:10:15,470 --> 02:10:16,770
I'll pretend this is...

3193
02:10:16,770 --> 02:10:19,210
Bro, this is ESAM right here.

3194
02:10:21,350 --> 02:10:23,650
Oh my god, perfect ESAM.

3195
02:10:25,370 --> 02:10:26,610
He doesn't slide.

3196
02:10:26,750 --> 02:10:27,530
It's not him.

3197
02:10:27,790 --> 02:10:28,770
He doesn't slide.

3198
02:10:30,630 --> 02:10:31,910
He needs to slide.

3199
02:10:32,210 --> 02:10:33,110
Round 2.

3200
02:10:34,010 --> 02:10:34,610
Fight.

3201
02:10:36,170 --> 02:10:38,210
The moment he starts sliding, then it's ESAM.

3202
02:10:38,670 --> 02:10:41,210
Because ESAM fucking abuses that shit.

3203
02:10:41,830 --> 02:10:43,050
So much.

3204
02:10:43,430 --> 02:10:44,250
It's actually crazy.

3205
02:10:46,390 --> 02:10:47,170
Goodbye.

3206
02:10:47,870 --> 02:10:48,650
Boom.

3207
02:10:49,530 --> 02:10:50,590
Oh shit.

3208
02:10:50,770 --> 02:10:51,830
He actually...

3209
02:10:51,830 --> 02:10:52,950
No!

3210
02:10:53,250 --> 02:10:54,250
ESAM, please!

3211
02:10:55,250 --> 02:10:56,030
ESAM!

3212
02:10:58,390 --> 02:10:59,170
Okay.

3213
02:10:59,370 --> 02:11:00,350
Leave me alone.

3214
02:11:01,030 --> 02:11:01,530
Hahaha.

3215
02:11:02,890 --> 02:11:03,470
Hahaha.

3216
02:11:07,430 --> 02:11:07,990
Okay.

3217
02:11:09,550 --> 02:11:11,490
If he abuses it, he's predictable.

3218
02:11:11,830 --> 02:11:12,830
But he knows!

3219
02:11:12,990 --> 02:11:13,890
That's the thing!

3220
02:11:14,150 --> 02:11:16,450
He knows if I start blocking, he fucking...

3221
02:11:16,450 --> 02:11:18,550
He swaps these...

3222
02:11:18,550 --> 02:11:19,970
He actually adapts!

3223
02:11:20,370 --> 02:11:22,310
Because he comes from fighting games!

3224
02:11:22,610 --> 02:11:23,970
And they actually adapt!

3225
02:11:24,390 --> 02:11:25,110
I don't adapt!

3226
02:11:26,170 --> 02:11:27,150
That's the thing!

3227
02:11:27,370 --> 02:11:28,370
I'll be like, what?

3228
02:11:28,530 --> 02:11:30,630
You mean I have to change my moveset?

3229
02:11:32,990 --> 02:11:33,550
What?

3230
02:11:33,890 --> 02:11:35,310
What do you mean?

3231
02:11:36,170 --> 02:11:37,710
I have to change how I play.

3232
02:11:39,450 --> 02:11:40,450
I lose that.

3233
02:11:41,530 --> 02:11:42,050
Attack!

3234
02:11:42,550 --> 02:11:46,430
I can block.

3235
02:11:46,510 --> 02:11:46,730
See?

3236
02:11:47,410 --> 02:11:48,110
I blocked.

3237
02:11:48,690 --> 02:11:50,710
But what does blocking do for me?

3238
02:11:51,650 --> 02:11:52,490
Look at that.

3239
02:11:52,590 --> 02:11:54,450
I blocked and I started getting shit on.

3240
02:11:55,090 --> 02:11:55,610
Hahaha.

3241
02:11:58,690 --> 02:11:59,210
Guys!

3242
02:11:59,590 --> 02:12:01,090
Who told me to block?

3243
02:12:05,700 --> 02:12:06,680
Look, I blocked.

3244
02:12:06,760 --> 02:12:07,020
See?

3245
02:12:07,720 --> 02:12:08,760
I blocked.

3246
02:12:08,800 --> 02:12:09,340
I blocked.

3247
02:12:10,260 --> 02:12:11,080
I blocked.

3248
02:12:12,300 --> 02:12:13,200
There we go.

3249
02:12:13,920 --> 02:12:15,460
Why the fuck did you do that?

3250
02:12:17,440 --> 02:12:18,020
What?

3251
02:12:18,140 --> 02:12:18,960
I was low!

3252
02:12:21,260 --> 02:12:22,380
Oh my god.

3253
02:12:23,340 --> 02:12:24,940
Get away from me!

3254
02:12:25,240 --> 02:12:26,140
Get away from me!

3255
02:12:26,160 --> 02:12:27,240
Go back to Smash Brothers!

3256
02:12:29,420 --> 02:12:30,320
Go back!

3257
02:12:30,420 --> 02:12:31,560
You're fucking bald!

3258
02:12:35,300 --> 02:12:35,880
Yay.

3259
02:12:39,360 --> 02:12:39,880
Alright, back.

3260
02:12:39,980 --> 02:12:40,500
Sorry about that.

3261
02:12:40,580 --> 02:12:40,940
Hahaha.

3262
02:12:42,360 --> 02:12:43,100
Welcome back.

3263
02:12:44,200 --> 02:12:46,240
Alright, we gotta play against Lars.

3264
02:12:48,440 --> 02:12:49,220
Not really.

3265
02:12:50,640 --> 02:12:51,080
Alright.

3266
02:12:51,080 --> 02:12:51,940
I'm watching this stream now.

3267
02:12:53,060 --> 02:12:54,380
I'm watching this FG versus Topp.

3268
02:12:54,380 --> 02:12:56,100
C U P E S M!

3269
02:12:56,560 --> 02:12:56,680
Hahaha.

3270
02:12:58,220 --> 02:13:00,020
Oh wait, he's purple, man!

3271
02:13:00,020 --> 02:13:00,700
Just like him!

3272
02:13:02,320 --> 02:13:03,860
Just like E S M!

3273
02:13:04,300 --> 02:13:05,340
He's purple too!

3274
02:13:05,940 --> 02:13:07,580
He just came from a local, so I know he's playing more than me.

3275
02:13:07,580 --> 02:13:09,120
He got the local buff.

3276
02:13:10,380 --> 02:13:11,480
Oh my god.

3277
02:13:12,580 --> 02:13:13,960
He's just like him!

3278
02:13:14,920 --> 02:13:17,320
Box was seven feet tall until yesterday.

3279
02:13:17,720 --> 02:13:18,320
That matters.

3280
02:13:18,320 --> 02:13:19,420
For real, by the way, good shit.

3281
02:13:19,520 --> 02:13:20,580
In that set, guys.

3282
02:13:21,480 --> 02:13:21,920
Yeah.

3283
02:13:23,320 --> 02:13:24,760
We're fucking top three.

3284
02:13:25,080 --> 02:13:26,860
Oh god.

3285
02:13:26,980 --> 02:13:27,480
We're in the money.

3286
02:13:27,880 --> 02:13:28,600
Oh god.

3287
02:13:29,320 --> 02:13:30,060
I'm sorry!

3288
02:13:30,980 --> 02:13:34,460
I mean, we just have to win one more set, whether it's winners or losers in the top two.

3289
02:13:34,460 --> 02:13:36,180
This happened to us in the first lane.

3290
02:13:36,460 --> 02:13:38,100
So... yeah.

3291
02:13:38,240 --> 02:13:39,140
We can do it, bro.

3292
02:13:41,380 --> 02:13:41,820
Okay.

3293
02:13:41,980 --> 02:13:42,400
Here we go.

3294
02:13:44,180 --> 02:13:44,620
Boom!

3295
02:13:45,420 --> 02:13:48,760
My biggest issue with tournaments is like, I know we can win.

3296
02:13:49,140 --> 02:13:50,680
Like, I know I can beat anybody.

3297
02:13:50,760 --> 02:13:52,540
I know you guys can beat anybody, but will we?

3298
02:13:52,540 --> 02:13:52,900
Right?

3299
02:13:53,060 --> 02:13:53,880
There we go.

3300
02:13:54,420 --> 02:13:55,840
That's the scary part.

3301
02:13:56,460 --> 02:13:57,340
Who's better today?

3302
02:13:59,600 --> 02:14:00,040
Boom!

3303
02:14:01,020 --> 02:14:01,460
Boom!

3304
02:14:02,560 --> 02:14:03,000
Boom!

3305
02:14:05,980 --> 02:14:07,000
That's fucking right!

3306
02:14:08,080 --> 02:14:08,640
ESEM!

3307
02:14:10,340 --> 02:14:12,700
Go back to your original game!

3308
02:14:15,860 --> 02:14:16,420
Okay.

3309
02:14:17,680 --> 02:14:20,840
At least my company likes the game I play.

3310
02:14:21,920 --> 02:14:23,060
Wait, that's fucked up.

3311
02:14:23,480 --> 02:14:27,000
At least the game company likes it when I play their video game.

3312
02:14:35,260 --> 02:14:36,520
You know it's true.

3313
02:14:38,600 --> 02:14:40,460
Apex never shut down anything.

3314
02:14:45,880 --> 02:14:49,600
That's why you have to use Tekken as a crutch!

3315
02:14:51,880 --> 02:14:55,560
I don't know, Ysab, I don't know who you are, it's just Tekken.

3316
02:15:01,680 --> 02:15:04,680
They are talking about anti-MATMAN strats on Boxstream.

3317
02:15:05,100 --> 02:15:05,660
Why?

3318
02:15:06,120 --> 02:15:07,240
Okay, rematch.

3319
02:15:07,540 --> 02:15:10,420
He just said he has it.

3320
02:15:11,280 --> 02:15:15,840
It's so funny that they are trying so hard to prep for you specifically.

3321
02:15:16,840 --> 02:15:17,840
Why man?

3322
02:15:18,020 --> 02:15:19,080
I'm just trying to play games.

3323
02:15:19,380 --> 02:15:20,680
Because you are the nuclear weapon!

3324
02:15:21,680 --> 02:15:22,780
You are the bomb!

3325
02:15:22,800 --> 02:15:25,140
Oh my god, please, I don't want to die!

3326
02:15:25,720 --> 02:15:26,240
I'm sorry.

3327
02:15:27,360 --> 02:15:29,180
I don't adapt!

3328
02:15:30,780 --> 02:15:32,360
I don't adapt!

3329
02:15:32,460 --> 02:15:32,620
I don't adapt!

3330
02:15:34,820 --> 02:15:39,580
This might be the time where they have literally had enough slams and enough time where they have latched on.

3331
02:15:39,700 --> 02:15:41,340
Again, specifically me.

3332
02:15:43,260 --> 02:15:44,920
Specifically me and my playstyle.

3333
02:15:45,500 --> 02:15:47,680
But you adapted as far as I did though.

3334
02:15:47,820 --> 02:15:50,160
You adapted with the gamma howl.

3335
02:15:50,160 --> 02:15:52,180
That was the biggest fuck you I have ever seen.

3336
02:15:52,900 --> 02:15:53,420
No!

3337
02:15:54,260 --> 02:15:54,840
Fuck you.

3338
02:15:55,700 --> 02:15:56,900
I gotta watch that back.

3339
02:15:58,180 --> 02:16:04,560
It's funny to see different styles because I kind of run over Zentreya because I just put on pressure.

3340
02:16:04,740 --> 02:16:10,440
But James is slower, which is better against Raiditz but worse against Zentreya because he gives her more opportunities to...

3341
02:16:11,320 --> 02:16:12,400
Get away from me.

3342
02:16:13,280 --> 02:16:14,900
Yeah, everyone has their own style.

3343
02:16:15,040 --> 02:16:15,460
It can work.

3344
02:16:16,340 --> 02:16:16,780
Yeah.

3345
02:16:18,900 --> 02:16:19,340
Boom!

3346
02:16:20,160 --> 02:16:21,340
Zentreya is up one though.

3347
02:16:21,740 --> 02:16:23,300
Yeah, that was ugly can-can style.

3348
02:16:23,400 --> 02:16:24,300
She is popping it too much.

3349
02:16:27,360 --> 02:16:28,160
Oh, she has to engage her Holy No!

3350
02:16:28,540 --> 02:16:30,140
You are not supposed to grab.

3351
02:16:31,240 --> 02:16:32,580
You just do kicks.

3352
02:16:42,070 --> 02:16:42,870
That's all fuck.

3353
02:16:42,950 --> 02:16:44,350
Ok, I did not think you would.

3354
02:16:44,610 --> 02:16:45,850
I thought you are gonna duck.

3355
02:16:47,030 --> 02:16:48,790
Please take me back to the other side.

3356
02:16:49,290 --> 02:16:49,690
Please.

3357
02:16:49,710 --> 02:16:51,090
I don't know how to play this.

3358
02:16:52,010 --> 02:16:53,190
That's nasty man.

3359
02:16:53,770 --> 02:16:54,390
You should.

3360
02:16:54,430 --> 02:16:55,070
You should do it.

3361
02:16:55,410 --> 02:16:57,370
He does the hop kick into the wall, into the choke.

3362
02:16:57,670 --> 02:16:58,430
That's fucked up.

3363
02:16:58,550 --> 02:16:59,150
That's a drop kick.

3364
02:16:59,150 --> 02:16:59,970
I'm angry.

3365
02:17:00,590 --> 02:17:02,070
I'm fucking mad.

3366
02:17:04,750 --> 02:17:06,070
Oh what?

3367
02:17:06,290 --> 02:17:06,770
No!

3368
02:17:10,370 --> 02:17:11,750
Let me leave!

3369
02:17:12,030 --> 02:17:13,070
Let me get up!

3370
02:17:13,750 --> 02:17:15,310
What the fuck is this?

3371
02:17:15,370 --> 02:17:18,690
This is how it's gonna go with me and Ysab.

3372
02:17:18,930 --> 02:17:21,330
It is just the future.

3373
02:17:21,790 --> 02:17:22,330
Definitely.

3374
02:17:22,650 --> 02:17:24,650
It shows the way he plays.

3375
02:17:24,750 --> 02:17:25,810
Like traditional fighters.

3376
02:17:25,810 --> 02:17:26,550
You know what I mean?

3377
02:17:27,510 --> 02:17:29,110
We saw the future.

3378
02:17:35,870 --> 02:17:38,630
Well it's just block and then maybe this.

3379
02:17:39,230 --> 02:17:41,450
If he starts sliding I just do this.

3380
02:17:41,710 --> 02:17:44,610
But like it's so... the timing is a lot.

3381
02:17:47,070 --> 02:17:48,470
His rage clip.

3382
02:17:48,670 --> 02:17:49,990
He never wants that to happen again.

3383
02:17:52,390 --> 02:17:54,170
He's just trying to stop that forever.

3384
02:17:55,930 --> 02:18:00,510
If you take one set from Ysab he has to unplug.

3385
02:18:10,560 --> 02:18:11,320
I did.

3386
02:18:11,420 --> 02:18:13,680
We talked about it yesterday.

3387
02:18:13,980 --> 02:18:15,160
The wizard is interesting.

3388
02:18:15,540 --> 02:18:17,500
I didn't even think of... Oh my god.

3389
02:18:18,040 --> 02:18:18,980
He's doing that a lot.

3390
02:18:21,340 --> 02:18:23,920
He counter hit her in between her rage drive.

3391
02:18:24,140 --> 02:18:24,600
I think.

3392
02:18:24,660 --> 02:18:25,500
That was crazy.

3393
02:18:25,820 --> 02:18:26,560
I don't know.

3394
02:18:26,580 --> 02:18:27,840
For some reason I thought it worked.

3395
02:18:28,040 --> 02:18:28,180
I don't think it.

3396
02:18:29,920 --> 02:18:32,340
I was like that would be funny if it works.

3397
02:18:32,360 --> 02:18:32,700
You know?

3398
02:18:37,480 --> 02:18:40,240
I just thought it would be funny if it worked again.

3399
02:18:40,940 --> 02:18:42,040
This one might be done.

3400
02:18:44,020 --> 02:18:45,440
Might be the end of KFM.

3401
02:18:45,540 --> 02:18:46,060
Actually no.

3402
02:18:46,180 --> 02:18:47,300
They are up 1-0.

3403
02:18:47,540 --> 02:18:48,500
This would just make it 1-1.

3404
02:18:49,320 --> 02:18:49,720
No!

3405
02:18:51,080 --> 02:18:51,940
I'm sorry!

3406
02:18:51,960 --> 02:18:53,580
I'd rather not fight in 1K again.

3407
02:18:53,700 --> 02:18:54,320
This shit is stressful.

3408
02:18:54,580 --> 02:18:54,820
AHHHH!

3409
02:18:55,400 --> 02:18:56,380
Stressful as fuck.

3410
02:18:56,380 --> 02:18:56,980
Yeah.

3411
02:18:57,260 --> 02:18:59,420
I'd rather fight in 1K than lose 2K.

3412
02:18:59,420 --> 02:19:00,200
Punish though.

3413
02:19:01,460 --> 02:19:02,340
Good hop.

3414
02:19:04,940 --> 02:19:05,500
Okay.

3415
02:19:05,600 --> 02:19:05,980
There you go.

3416
02:19:06,020 --> 02:19:06,220
Okay.

3417
02:19:06,540 --> 02:19:07,800
Oh I don't get this.

3418
02:19:08,940 --> 02:19:09,500
Please.

3419
02:19:09,780 --> 02:19:10,040
Oh.

3420
02:19:10,780 --> 02:19:11,340
Sorry.

3421
02:19:17,650 --> 02:19:19,010
Scream that stress away.

3422
02:19:22,030 --> 02:19:25,010
I have to fight Ysab!

3423
02:19:26,250 --> 02:19:26,690
Woah!

3424
02:19:26,850 --> 02:19:27,690
Oh I missed.

3425
02:19:28,370 --> 02:19:28,810
Oh.

3426
02:19:28,910 --> 02:19:29,350
Oh.

3427
02:19:29,510 --> 02:19:29,550
Oh.

3428
02:19:31,050 --> 02:19:32,350
So you can duck that one.

3429
02:19:32,470 --> 02:19:33,150
Oh my gosh.

3430
02:19:34,170 --> 02:19:34,610
Okay.

3431
02:19:34,610 --> 02:19:36,450
That dropped probably.

3432
02:19:36,550 --> 02:19:37,330
It bounced.

3433
02:19:37,770 --> 02:19:38,050
Wow.

3434
02:19:38,210 --> 02:19:38,550
Yeah.

3435
02:19:38,550 --> 02:19:38,730
Yeah.

3436
02:19:38,730 --> 02:19:38,850
Yeah.

3437
02:19:39,210 --> 02:19:39,650
Therapy.

3438
02:19:39,650 --> 02:19:40,050
Yeah.

3439
02:19:40,350 --> 02:19:41,870
She's clutching it out.

3440
02:19:42,090 --> 02:19:42,530
Yup.

3441
02:19:43,750 --> 02:19:44,830
Oh my god.

3442
02:19:45,130 --> 02:19:45,250
Bro.

3443
02:19:45,290 --> 02:19:46,730
I watched some of her sets back.

3444
02:19:46,750 --> 02:19:47,150
What the fuck?

3445
02:19:47,150 --> 02:19:47,610
I'm blocking!

3446
02:19:48,090 --> 02:19:49,390
I can just smash!

3447
02:19:49,470 --> 02:19:49,990
I was just saying.

3448
02:19:50,350 --> 02:19:50,790
Fuck.

3449
02:19:51,070 --> 02:19:51,750
He blocked.

3450
02:19:51,850 --> 02:19:52,130
Okay.

3451
02:19:52,190 --> 02:19:52,350
Yeah.

3452
02:19:52,350 --> 02:19:52,950
She was toxic.

3453
02:19:52,950 --> 02:19:55,030
Jintrae was saying some shit dude.

3454
02:19:55,710 --> 02:19:56,070
What?

3455
02:19:56,070 --> 02:19:56,430
Really?

3456
02:19:56,490 --> 02:19:57,610
She was being toxic.

3457
02:19:57,750 --> 02:19:58,110
Really?

3458
02:19:58,110 --> 02:19:58,150
Yes.

3459
02:19:58,910 --> 02:20:01,190
She was like get that spammer out of the fucking lobby.

3460
02:20:01,470 --> 02:20:02,550
Spamming fucking cringe.

3461
02:20:02,670 --> 02:20:03,150
I was like Jesus.

3462
02:20:03,490 --> 02:20:04,350
Like oh my god.

3463
02:20:04,530 --> 02:20:04,910
Oh my god.

3464
02:20:05,190 --> 02:20:05,790
That was crazy.

3465
02:20:06,470 --> 02:20:08,470
That's just like you after you beat Eerop.

3466
02:20:08,670 --> 02:20:09,030
True.

3467
02:20:09,350 --> 02:20:09,710
True.

3468
02:20:09,870 --> 02:20:10,090
I'm fucking better than you dude.

3469
02:20:10,090 --> 02:20:11,110
Well I was better than you though.

3470
02:20:11,110 --> 02:20:11,570
This is it.

3471
02:20:11,870 --> 02:20:12,390
Fuck this.

3472
02:20:12,730 --> 02:20:14,370
Fuck doing actual combos.

3473
02:20:14,390 --> 02:20:15,250
I was better though.

3474
02:20:15,250 --> 02:20:16,530
Fuck doing actual combos.

3475
02:20:16,630 --> 02:20:17,690
This is the way to go.

3476
02:20:17,890 --> 02:20:18,650
I was so annoyed.

3477
02:20:18,990 --> 02:20:20,130
I was so annoyed.

3478
02:20:20,230 --> 02:20:21,630
You were just doing the same fucking.

3479
02:20:21,730 --> 02:20:22,090
Fuck doing this.

3480
02:20:22,090 --> 02:20:22,790
I hate losing the box.

3481
02:20:22,790 --> 02:20:24,030
Actual combos.

3482
02:20:26,390 --> 02:20:27,210
But she did.

3483
02:20:27,270 --> 02:20:28,670
She came back around after a second.

3484
02:20:28,690 --> 02:20:29,990
She was like I was you know.

3485
02:20:29,990 --> 02:20:31,550
It was just like a release of tension.

3486
02:20:32,030 --> 02:20:32,790
She won.

3487
02:20:33,790 --> 02:20:34,530
One more.

3488
02:20:34,650 --> 02:20:34,890
Okay.

3489
02:20:35,690 --> 02:20:36,390
This is.

3490
02:20:36,410 --> 02:20:37,030
Fuck this.

3491
02:20:37,270 --> 02:20:40,270
I don't need combos to sound like this.

3492
02:20:40,470 --> 02:20:42,030
I think James is better than him dude.

3493
02:20:42,210 --> 02:20:43,950
I think James gets nervous bro.

3494
02:20:44,090 --> 02:20:44,490
Like.

3495
02:20:44,750 --> 02:20:45,190
Bro.

3496
02:20:45,610 --> 02:20:46,350
I don't know.

3497
02:20:46,350 --> 02:20:47,630
Who cares about combos.

3498
02:20:47,810 --> 02:20:49,290
Why am I trying new things.

3499
02:20:49,630 --> 02:20:50,330
Do what you.

3500
02:20:50,490 --> 02:20:51,270
Do what you.

3501
02:20:51,310 --> 02:20:52,770
What you did to get to this Eerop.

3502
02:20:52,770 --> 02:20:55,830
When the alligator can sue you.

3503
02:20:55,830 --> 02:20:56,030
He's pressure now.

3504
02:20:56,250 --> 02:20:56,670
Oh yeah.

3505
02:20:56,930 --> 02:20:57,910
More pressure.

3506
02:20:58,070 --> 02:20:58,570
Doki it.

3507
02:20:58,670 --> 02:21:00,630
You fucking listen to people.

3508
02:21:00,850 --> 02:21:02,850
Trying to block and everything.

3509
02:21:03,190 --> 02:21:05,310
Do what got you into this Eerop.

3510
02:21:05,490 --> 02:21:06,830
Do what's right.

3511
02:21:08,110 --> 02:21:09,330
Do fucking.

3512
02:21:09,330 --> 02:21:11,270
Do what's fucking right.

3513
02:21:16,050 --> 02:21:18,870
Don't let them tell you what to do.

3514
02:21:19,950 --> 02:21:21,910
Just do what's fucking right.

3515
02:21:21,990 --> 02:21:22,070
Oh my god.

3516
02:21:22,270 --> 02:21:22,750
I just.

3517
02:21:22,770 --> 02:21:23,850
I just want to see if she finished that combo.

3518
02:21:24,790 --> 02:21:25,310
Oh.

3519
02:21:25,350 --> 02:21:25,490
Oh.

3520
02:21:25,490 --> 02:21:25,890
I'm behind.

3521
02:21:26,070 --> 02:21:26,170
Oh.

3522
02:21:26,290 --> 02:21:26,970
She dropped it.

3523
02:21:27,050 --> 02:21:27,190
Oh.

3524
02:21:27,530 --> 02:21:28,050
Okay.

3525
02:21:29,010 --> 02:21:31,310
Do what comes naturally.

3526
02:21:37,350 --> 02:21:37,870
Doki.

3527
02:21:37,990 --> 02:21:39,230
You thought too much.

3528
02:21:39,230 --> 02:21:40,030
Against Gumi.

3529
02:21:40,190 --> 02:21:41,610
You thought too much.

3530
02:21:41,670 --> 02:21:42,830
You were thinking.

3531
02:21:43,010 --> 02:21:44,270
And then you didn't.

3532
02:21:44,310 --> 02:21:45,870
All you did was block.

3533
02:21:45,970 --> 02:21:46,890
You fucking.

3534
02:21:46,910 --> 02:21:47,590
You were.

3535
02:21:47,830 --> 02:21:48,830
You were not.

3536
02:21:48,890 --> 02:21:50,950
You were known as 30 defense Doki.

3537
02:21:51,190 --> 02:21:51,710
Not.

3538
02:21:52,870 --> 02:21:54,570
It was not meant to be.

3539
02:21:54,710 --> 02:21:57,530
The moment I started attacking it was over.

3540
02:21:57,710 --> 02:21:59,790
I was like, you're right.

3541
02:22:00,190 --> 02:22:01,410
My ass is getting twirled.

3542
02:22:01,510 --> 02:22:01,990
Oh my god.

3543
02:22:03,470 --> 02:22:05,510
My ass is getting twirled.

3544
02:22:06,410 --> 02:22:07,530
Oh my god.

3545
02:22:07,910 --> 02:22:09,570
He wishes he was mad.

3546
02:22:09,870 --> 02:22:10,950
You need a punish here!

3547
02:22:11,490 --> 02:22:12,050
Zen!

3548
02:22:12,110 --> 02:22:13,710
Oh my god, dude.

3549
02:22:13,750 --> 02:22:14,470
There's no way.

3550
02:22:14,470 --> 02:22:16,610
He wishes he was just like him!

3551
02:22:16,690 --> 02:22:17,350
There's no way, dude.

3552
02:22:17,530 --> 02:22:18,890
You're not like Jack!

3553
02:22:18,930 --> 02:22:19,390
Jesus!

3554
02:22:19,390 --> 02:22:20,550
You're cooking this man.

3555
02:22:21,570 --> 02:22:23,750
You're so fucking bad!

3556
02:22:24,290 --> 02:22:25,370
Get alley kicked!

3557
02:22:26,390 --> 02:22:29,310
I'm watching if he goes up to like...

3558
02:22:29,310 --> 02:22:32,010
No one needs defense!

3559
02:22:32,550 --> 02:22:34,830
Defense is for losers!

3560
02:22:36,970 --> 02:22:40,390
You got to win with my different defending!

3561
02:22:43,250 --> 02:22:44,870
Get fucked off!

3562
02:22:46,370 --> 02:22:47,850
No one needs defense!

3563
02:22:50,750 --> 02:22:52,890
I didn't know Zen got this good this quickly.

3564
02:22:53,390 --> 02:22:54,670
She's in Garu, dude!

3565
02:22:54,890 --> 02:22:55,210
Bro!

3566
02:22:56,190 --> 02:22:56,830
Yeah, yeah.

3567
02:22:57,010 --> 02:22:58,750
Okay, he's starting to do a little parry.

3568
02:22:58,750 --> 02:22:59,610
I guess they haven't been playing ranked.

3569
02:22:59,690 --> 02:23:00,570
He's just been practicing.

3570
02:23:00,610 --> 02:23:00,810
Yeah.

3571
02:23:01,550 --> 02:23:01,990
Yes.

3572
02:23:02,170 --> 02:23:03,130
Damn, James Cook.

3573
02:23:03,250 --> 02:23:03,510
Wow.

3574
02:23:03,610 --> 02:23:04,230
Final game.

3575
02:23:04,270 --> 02:23:04,790
Final round.

3576
02:23:05,030 --> 02:23:05,470
No.

3577
02:23:06,070 --> 02:23:07,430
Bro, why are you defending?

3578
02:23:10,730 --> 02:23:11,790
Can-can there.

3579
02:23:11,910 --> 02:23:14,170
He goes for burning knuckle.

3580
02:23:14,250 --> 02:23:16,630
James is like... disrespectful.

3581
02:23:17,070 --> 02:23:17,330
Okay.

3582
02:23:17,330 --> 02:23:18,430
He's an animal, dude.

3583
02:23:18,490 --> 02:23:19,090
He did that fucking...

3584
02:23:19,090 --> 02:23:19,390
Leave me alone.

3585
02:23:19,650 --> 02:23:20,390
Leave me alone.

3586
02:23:20,510 --> 02:23:21,030
Leave me alone!

3587
02:23:21,050 --> 02:23:21,510
No way.

3588
02:23:21,690 --> 02:23:22,450
He's spamming.

3589
02:23:23,070 --> 02:23:25,390
He's... Oh my god.

3590
02:23:25,670 --> 02:23:26,110
Bam!

3591
02:23:26,350 --> 02:23:27,070
They didn't laugh at that.

3592
02:23:27,950 --> 02:23:28,610
Fuck off!

3593
02:23:29,590 --> 02:23:30,030
Crazy.

3594
02:23:30,290 --> 02:23:31,170
That's fucking right.

3595
02:23:31,350 --> 02:23:32,370
He's such a nerd.

3596
02:23:32,650 --> 02:23:34,290
Freaking James Chensor.

3597
02:23:34,810 --> 02:23:36,930
Elbow, elbow, elbow, elbow, elbow, elbow.

3598
02:23:38,130 --> 02:23:38,810
No, no.

3599
02:23:38,850 --> 02:23:40,250
He broke my wall... my floor!

3600
02:23:40,670 --> 02:23:41,850
That was mad close.

3601
02:23:42,150 --> 02:23:43,270
He broke my floor!

3602
02:23:43,430 --> 02:23:44,470
Did you see the chat?

3603
02:23:44,610 --> 02:23:45,230
My floor!

3604
02:23:46,210 --> 02:23:46,410
Jesus.

3605
02:23:46,410 --> 02:23:47,550
My floor!

3606
02:23:47,790 --> 02:23:49,110
The main one?

3607
02:23:49,230 --> 02:23:50,450
In the Discord chat.

3608
02:23:51,570 --> 02:23:52,090
Wait...

3609
02:23:52,090 --> 02:23:54,150
Look at stage one.

3610
02:23:54,470 --> 02:23:55,370
Blocking is cringe.

3611
02:23:55,390 --> 02:23:56,610
The trades have learned from combos.

3612
02:23:56,750 --> 02:23:57,170
Jesus.

3613
02:23:57,290 --> 02:23:58,410
The tag's only weakness.

3614
02:23:58,750 --> 02:23:59,130
Oh my god.

3615
02:24:00,710 --> 02:24:02,010
I see it, dude.

3616
02:24:02,590 --> 02:24:05,330
See, it's not- Blocking is fucking stupid.

3617
02:24:09,750 --> 02:24:10,930
Blocking is so fucking stupid.

3618
02:24:10,930 --> 02:24:13,210
Those two elbows look like a good combo to me.

3619
02:24:13,430 --> 02:24:14,390
Blocking is so stupid.

3620
02:24:14,390 --> 02:24:15,830
That looked like a combo.

3621
02:24:17,410 --> 02:24:19,590
A little bit of 1-2 action.

3622
02:24:20,150 --> 02:24:23,230
Jack wouldn't have fucking...

3623
02:24:23,910 --> 02:24:27,590
Matt would not have given me a round.

3624
02:24:28,050 --> 02:24:29,890
That's all I'm saying.

3625
02:24:31,830 --> 02:24:33,950
Matt would not have given me that round.

3626
02:24:38,010 --> 02:24:39,130
Oh, adaption.

3627
02:24:39,230 --> 02:24:40,290
It's spamming.

3628
02:24:40,350 --> 02:24:41,070
Oh no!

3629
02:24:41,070 --> 02:24:41,310
No!

3630
02:24:43,050 --> 02:24:43,650
No!

3631
02:24:44,550 --> 02:24:46,130
Oh my god, what is that?

3632
02:24:46,710 --> 02:24:48,130
What's that kek, bro?

3633
02:24:50,290 --> 02:24:51,830
Jack Jesus, exactly.

3634
02:24:52,310 --> 02:24:54,150
Not my Jack Jesus.

3635
02:24:54,390 --> 02:24:57,290
Jack Jesus would have swept me so hard.

3636
02:24:57,650 --> 02:24:57,710
You know what's funny?

3637
02:24:57,710 --> 02:24:59,670
If you don't have the window selected, the kek doesn't move.

3638
02:24:59,990 --> 02:25:01,070
Hold on, let me see if I can...

3639
02:25:01,070 --> 02:25:01,630
There it goes.

3640
02:25:02,470 --> 02:25:03,590
But then...

3641
02:25:06,990 --> 02:25:08,490
Oh my god.

3642
02:25:09,750 --> 02:25:11,050
Fighting games are fun.

3643
02:25:11,070 --> 02:25:11,690
Funny, bro.

3644
02:25:12,950 --> 02:25:13,910
It's a good time.

3645
02:25:14,130 --> 02:25:16,250
It's like super stressful, but super fun too.

3646
02:25:16,250 --> 02:25:18,470
After this game, we're gonna live watch with the homies.

3647
02:25:18,590 --> 02:25:19,870
The false prophet.

3648
02:25:21,150 --> 02:25:24,490
Yeah, Matt would have gotten 4 perfects out of there.

3649
02:25:24,490 --> 02:25:25,870
My chat is out of there.

3650
02:25:26,750 --> 02:25:31,130
Yeah, if this was Matt, he would have let me start up.

3651
02:25:31,390 --> 02:25:33,090
What is wrong with you?

3652
02:25:33,310 --> 02:25:35,230
And you trying to learn Jack?

3653
02:25:35,590 --> 02:25:38,990
If you can't get 3 perfects in a row, uninstall now.

3654
02:25:40,850 --> 02:25:41,910
Royciato, man.

3655
02:25:43,170 --> 02:25:45,030
He should be the first seed.

3656
02:25:49,730 --> 02:25:50,910
Oh my god.

3657
02:25:51,630 --> 02:25:53,330
Dude, Fairlight is also nuts.

3658
02:25:53,330 --> 02:25:56,090
I knew blocking was never it.

3659
02:25:56,470 --> 02:25:57,790
But that guy is...

3660
02:25:57,790 --> 02:26:00,250
He spams a lot of shoulder and he gets away with it.

3661
02:26:00,410 --> 02:26:01,830
In his tier.

3662
02:26:02,150 --> 02:26:03,530
We gotta launch that shit.

3663
02:26:04,630 --> 02:26:08,190
Like if he did it on slime once, slime kills him.

3664
02:26:08,330 --> 02:26:08,970
Like more than once.

3665
02:26:08,990 --> 02:26:11,030
Like 80% if he has heat and a wall.

3666
02:26:11,850 --> 02:26:13,410
Oh, Roy beat Fairlight apparently.

3667
02:26:13,630 --> 02:26:13,790
Okay.

3668
02:26:14,390 --> 02:26:15,630
Don't learn all the moves.

3669
02:26:15,710 --> 02:26:17,930
Just learn the moves you can take it in.

3670
02:26:18,190 --> 02:26:20,710
Feels like he's supposed to be the shoto, right?

3671
02:26:20,790 --> 02:26:21,870
He's like the most basic character.

3672
02:26:22,070 --> 02:26:24,390
But he's got these weird fucking...

3673
02:26:25,730 --> 02:26:26,170
corny...

3674
02:26:26,170 --> 02:26:28,670
It doesn't feel like I'm losing to a shoto.

3675
02:26:28,770 --> 02:26:29,370
You know what I mean?

3676
02:26:30,190 --> 02:26:31,210
It's hard to explain.

3677
02:26:33,670 --> 02:26:37,170
Yeah, he's like the weirdest shoto I've ever seen in a funny show.

3678
02:26:37,570 --> 02:26:38,010
No!

3679
02:26:40,210 --> 02:26:42,510
Doki, why are you trying to do blocking again?

3680
02:26:43,190 --> 02:26:45,190
Have you not learned anything?

3681
02:26:47,050 --> 02:26:47,930
Have you not learned anything?

3682
02:26:47,930 --> 02:26:48,130
Have you not learned anything?

3683
02:26:48,790 --> 02:26:50,090
Ishimas are really not comparable.

3684
02:26:50,390 --> 02:26:52,810
I just mean like as the default characters.

3685
02:26:53,030 --> 02:26:53,190
I just mean like as the default characters.

3686
02:26:53,190 --> 02:26:54,170
Oh my god, Doki!

3687
02:26:54,250 --> 02:26:55,270
Look what happened to you!

3688
02:26:56,410 --> 02:26:56,850
Oh!

3689
02:27:00,030 --> 02:27:01,490
Guys, I need to stop blocking.

3690
02:27:01,750 --> 02:27:02,430
It's a good ending.

3691
02:27:04,550 --> 02:27:06,530
I need to stop blocking, guys.

3692
02:27:06,570 --> 02:27:07,990
It's actually messing me up.

3693
02:27:08,030 --> 02:27:08,710
The good timeline.

3694
02:27:08,990 --> 02:27:09,750
It all worked out.

3695
02:27:10,430 --> 02:27:12,610
It's all... it actually is messing me up.

3696
02:27:13,030 --> 02:27:14,670
Stop learning blocking!

3697
02:27:16,650 --> 02:27:17,570
He knows what's up.

3698
02:27:18,130 --> 02:27:18,270
He knows what's up.

3699
02:27:19,350 --> 02:27:20,150
Oh shit.

3700
02:27:20,990 --> 02:27:22,630
I punched the wrong thing.

3701
02:27:22,930 --> 02:27:25,190
Tekken is weird because the poster boys are the hard characters.

3702
02:27:25,570 --> 02:27:26,470
Oh, that's a good point.

3703
02:27:26,750 --> 02:27:28,990
Because it's Free Fighter like Ken for you.

3704
02:27:29,050 --> 02:27:29,930
Okay, there you go.

3705
02:27:30,030 --> 02:27:31,470
Not easy, but like...

3706
02:27:31,470 --> 02:27:33,930
Yeah, Kaze is probably the most demanding.

3707
02:27:33,970 --> 02:27:35,330
He's been the poster boy forever.

3708
02:27:35,330 --> 02:27:36,130
And now it's Jin.

3709
02:27:36,490 --> 02:27:38,050
He's easier but still.

3710
02:27:38,590 --> 02:27:39,470
Okay, there you go.

3711
02:27:40,450 --> 02:27:41,290
Oh my god.

3712
02:27:41,470 --> 02:27:43,190
He's like the easiest Tekken character.

3713
02:27:43,810 --> 02:27:45,250
Come on, let me punch you.

3714
02:27:45,310 --> 02:27:45,830
Let me punch you!

3715
02:27:47,510 --> 02:27:48,390
Maybe Victor.

3716
02:27:48,910 --> 02:27:50,970
Is there like a legacy like this character?

3717
02:27:51,090 --> 02:27:51,530
Boom!

3718
02:27:51,690 --> 02:27:57,210
Paul has a high skill ceiling.

3719
02:27:57,310 --> 02:27:59,630
But I feel like new players can pick him up though.

3720
02:27:59,950 --> 02:28:00,390
That's fucking right!

3721
02:28:00,390 --> 02:28:01,590
But I feel like that's a really good design.

3722
02:28:01,590 --> 02:28:04,410
When new players can pick him up but the ceiling is still very high.

3723
02:28:04,930 --> 02:28:05,290
I ducked!

3724
02:28:05,290 --> 02:28:07,090
I'm gonna fucking step you on the crouch!

3725
02:28:07,950 --> 02:28:08,870
Oh, I'm sorry.

3726
02:28:09,170 --> 02:28:11,450
I don't disagree bro.

3727
02:28:11,590 --> 02:28:12,490
King is not...

3728
02:28:13,210 --> 02:28:13,910
No, please.

3729
02:28:14,010 --> 02:28:15,550
Do my thing.

3730
02:28:16,870 --> 02:28:17,590
He's good to pick up.

3731
02:28:17,590 --> 02:28:19,210
He's not the easiest to optimize though.

3732
02:28:19,270 --> 02:28:21,130
You gotta land all your blue sparks and stuff.

3733
02:28:21,290 --> 02:28:21,650
Okay.

3734
02:28:22,030 --> 02:28:25,070
Oh, I didn't mean to do that!

3735
02:28:25,170 --> 02:28:25,950
I didn't mean to do that!

3736
02:28:26,090 --> 02:28:27,170
I didn't mean to pick it up!

3737
02:28:27,790 --> 02:28:29,290
I can't get carried away with the grabs.

3738
02:28:33,810 --> 02:28:34,250
I don't know what I'm doing.

3739
02:28:34,250 --> 02:28:35,330
Okay, but what if I do that?

3740
02:28:35,470 --> 02:28:39,170
I genuinely can't fathom how you guys play so many grabs.

3741
02:28:39,290 --> 02:28:40,270
My brain can't...

3742
02:28:40,270 --> 02:28:43,310
Like, how does your brain work that fast?

3743
02:28:43,510 --> 02:28:44,310
It's crazy to me.

3744
02:28:44,590 --> 02:28:46,230
It's just the pace of the game, really.

3745
02:28:47,070 --> 02:28:47,510
Okay.

3746
02:28:48,470 --> 02:28:50,270
How was I too slow for this?

3747
02:28:50,330 --> 02:28:51,010
Look at the hands.

3748
02:28:53,950 --> 02:28:54,690
That's crazy.

3749
02:28:55,770 --> 02:28:57,890
Well, you can judge the situation also.

3750
02:28:58,090 --> 02:29:00,410
Because Giant Swing comes out faster than the others.

3751
02:29:00,530 --> 02:29:01,570
So, MYK, you're the best.

3752
02:29:01,590 --> 02:29:02,150
I'm sorry.

3753
02:29:02,170 --> 02:29:02,970
I punch you!

3754
02:29:03,450 --> 02:29:04,530
Oh, I don't punch you!

3755
02:29:05,210 --> 02:29:06,410
I pressed the wrong one!

3756
02:29:07,110 --> 02:29:08,190
Leave me alone!

3757
02:29:08,510 --> 02:29:09,210
And also habits.

3758
02:29:09,490 --> 02:29:12,250
What grab do they like to go for?

3759
02:29:12,310 --> 02:29:14,110
At what distance, I guess?

3760
02:29:14,230 --> 02:29:17,930
Oh, I didn't buffer it because I'm...

3761
02:29:17,930 --> 02:29:19,230
Oh, I'm not gaming anymore!

3762
02:29:22,650 --> 02:29:23,950
I mean, I know that...

3763
02:29:23,950 --> 02:29:24,430
There you go.

3764
02:29:26,850 --> 02:29:29,950
...people set up training regiments for hand stuff.

3765
02:29:30,050 --> 02:29:31,310
And I feel like you can do that for like...

3766
02:29:32,050 --> 02:29:32,770
...six hours.

3767
02:29:33,610 --> 02:29:35,010
Maybe you'll be locked in, but...

3768
02:29:35,010 --> 02:29:39,070
Yeah, if you do it 15 minutes a day for a week, I don't see you not getting better at that.

3769
02:29:39,070 --> 02:29:40,710
Oh my god, how does he fucking just jab?

3770
02:29:40,850 --> 02:29:42,490
Such an easy tech to get used to.

3771
02:29:42,950 --> 02:29:44,150
Our reaction time is...

3772
02:29:44,150 --> 02:29:44,770
Okay, nice.

3773
02:29:44,870 --> 02:29:45,510
I got that.

3774
02:29:45,710 --> 02:29:47,750
I actually died...intentionally!

3775
02:29:51,330 --> 02:29:53,010
Slime was doing it yesterday, the day we were here.

3776
02:29:56,810 --> 02:29:57,730
Oh, what the fuck?

3777
02:29:57,770 --> 02:29:58,470
He just grabbed me.

3778
02:29:58,850 --> 02:29:59,810
That should be illegal.

3779
02:30:01,310 --> 02:30:01,730
Yeah, 1-1.

3780
02:30:01,890 --> 02:30:04,350
Oh, no!

3781
02:30:05,070 --> 02:30:06,830
Oh, dude, yeah, don't turn that.

3782
02:30:06,870 --> 02:30:10,130
It was funny, but chat makes it so much fun.

3783
02:30:11,570 --> 02:30:13,450
Blocking is for fucking pussies.

3784
02:30:13,590 --> 02:30:14,690
Okay, let's watch...

3785
02:30:14,690 --> 02:30:16,370
Let's watch the match with everybody.

3786
02:30:21,050 --> 02:30:23,750
Alright, let me grab the stream.

3787
02:30:24,110 --> 02:30:24,470
Cool.

3788
02:30:24,850 --> 02:30:26,310
Okay, where is the stream?

3789
02:30:26,610 --> 02:30:28,210
Wow, my chat's so much better now.

3790
02:30:28,810 --> 02:30:29,630
Say jam.

3791
02:30:30,150 --> 02:30:30,670
Twitch.

3792
02:30:35,870 --> 02:30:36,790
Alright, here you go.

3793
02:30:38,030 --> 02:30:38,530
Alright, here you go.

3794
02:30:38,530 --> 02:30:38,870
Alright, here you go.

3795
02:30:38,870 --> 02:30:39,610
Pin message.

3796
02:30:40,250 --> 02:30:40,350
Pin message.

3797
02:30:44,580 --> 02:30:46,000
Are they tied right now?

3798
02:30:46,320 --> 02:30:47,460
I'm watching it now.

3799
02:30:48,080 --> 02:30:49,120
Look at the bottom.

3800
02:30:49,240 --> 02:30:50,320
The check mark's at the bottom.

3801
02:30:50,440 --> 02:30:51,360
They'll tell you...

3802
02:30:51,360 --> 02:30:52,860
Oh, it's 1-1.

3803
02:30:54,460 --> 02:30:55,920
Yeah, this shit's close.

3804
02:30:56,360 --> 02:30:57,960
Everything's going final game.

3805
02:30:58,080 --> 02:30:58,660
It's unbelievable.

3806
02:30:59,060 --> 02:31:00,380
Which is crazy, dude!

3807
02:31:00,380 --> 02:31:01,780
Who do we want to win?

3808
02:31:03,320 --> 02:31:03,800
Uh...

3809
02:31:03,800 --> 02:31:06,440
Roy Chiotto's a nerd, so the other team.

3810
02:31:06,740 --> 02:31:07,200
Oh, okay.

3811
02:31:07,420 --> 02:31:08,320
Wait, Team NYK?

3812
02:31:08,560 --> 02:31:09,040
Well...

3813
02:31:09,560 --> 02:31:10,800
NYK brought us close.

3814
02:31:11,920 --> 02:31:13,440
The only person we didn't...

3815
02:31:13,440 --> 02:31:16,040
On Roy's team, didn't we only lose to Roy?

3816
02:31:16,260 --> 02:31:17,660
No, I lost to Logan.

3817
02:31:17,900 --> 02:31:21,160
Logan beat me once, and then I lost to Logan on the second.

3818
02:31:21,260 --> 02:31:22,540
Because he hard studied King.

3819
02:31:23,480 --> 02:31:23,720
Oh, I see.

3820
02:31:24,080 --> 02:31:26,900
So she beat him first time, he beat her second time.

3821
02:31:27,040 --> 02:31:28,220
I'll beat Zentrea probably.

3822
02:31:28,220 --> 02:31:29,180
I mean, I assume.

3823
02:31:30,720 --> 02:31:32,340
You know, Roy's very good.

3824
02:31:32,500 --> 02:31:34,800
I forget who the fourth seed on KFM's team is.

3825
02:31:36,580 --> 02:31:37,580
Did we beat him?

3826
02:31:38,020 --> 02:31:38,640
That's Amaz.

3827
02:31:39,940 --> 02:31:41,760
Yeah, oh yeah, he beat...

3828
02:31:41,760 --> 02:31:43,920
Yeah, he was the one that beat him.

3829
02:31:44,060 --> 02:31:44,180
Yeah.

3830
02:31:44,740 --> 02:31:48,760
Because they have King players to actively play against.

3831
02:31:49,500 --> 02:31:51,400
Hey, best case scenario...

3832
02:31:51,400 --> 02:31:52,620
We fight...

3833
02:31:53,200 --> 02:31:53,940
Scar's team.

3834
02:31:55,340 --> 02:31:57,260
So we want NYK to win?

3835
02:31:57,460 --> 02:31:57,600
Yeah.

3836
02:31:58,220 --> 02:32:00,600
I don't want to fight James Chen again, man.

3837
02:32:00,680 --> 02:32:01,900
Yeah, but like...

3838
02:32:02,780 --> 02:32:04,040
I'm 2-0, bro.

3839
02:32:04,240 --> 02:32:04,660
Alright, alright.

3840
02:32:06,100 --> 02:32:09,000
For the one time, you guys gotta carry my ass.

3841
02:32:11,000 --> 02:32:11,400
But...

3842
02:32:11,400 --> 02:32:11,500
But...

3843
02:32:11,500 --> 02:32:13,340
Logan hard studied.

3844
02:32:13,440 --> 02:32:14,860
For the one time, I really need you guys.

3845
02:32:17,180 --> 02:32:18,540
Yeah, we got it.

3846
02:32:18,580 --> 02:32:19,040
We'll lock in.

3847
02:32:21,080 --> 02:32:22,380
I mean, this isn't losers.

3848
02:32:22,560 --> 02:32:24,020
This is assuming we lose to Tony.

3849
02:32:24,100 --> 02:32:25,340
We could just win and beat Tony.

3850
02:32:26,620 --> 02:32:27,380
That's funny.

3851
02:32:28,420 --> 02:32:31,800
I was just in replay system studying the fuck out of BoxBox.

3852
02:32:32,200 --> 02:32:33,470
It's their fucking fourth...

3853
02:32:34,120 --> 02:32:35,680
It's fucking ESAM, dude.

3854
02:32:35,780 --> 02:32:36,580
It's so annoying.

3855
02:32:36,720 --> 02:32:37,840
What is he doing there?

3856
02:32:38,360 --> 02:32:41,680
Okay, if I take like one round off of him, I should just win.

3857
02:32:42,100 --> 02:32:42,740
I know.

3858
02:32:42,880 --> 02:32:44,300
You should just tell him that.

3859
02:32:44,340 --> 02:32:45,540
I should just win.

3860
02:32:45,540 --> 02:32:46,480
That's not fair.

3861
02:32:48,660 --> 02:32:53,660
I told Sajam that after the whole thing is done, I want to do an exhibition Tekken Ball.

3862
02:32:54,420 --> 02:32:55,320
An exhibition Tekken Ball?

3863
02:32:55,340 --> 02:32:56,680
An exhibition Tekken Ball.

3864
02:32:56,760 --> 02:33:00,140
I don't know who wants to Tekken Ball me, but someone's gonna get balled on.

3865
02:33:00,320 --> 02:33:06,960
I don't know who wants to Tekken Ball me, but someone's gonna get balled on.

3866
02:33:06,960 --> 02:33:07,880
Kaiser and Fear also won one.

3867
02:33:08,360 --> 02:33:09,600
That's crazy, dude.

3868
02:33:09,740 --> 02:33:10,160
Dude.

3869
02:33:11,360 --> 02:33:14,860
Who are we playing against if we lose to Tone?

3870
02:33:16,080 --> 02:33:17,600
I don't know if we know yet.

3871
02:33:17,840 --> 02:33:18,500
We don't know.

3872
02:33:19,520 --> 02:33:22,420
The winner of this bracket has to play a different person, right?

3873
02:33:23,900 --> 02:33:24,820
I think so.

3874
02:33:24,820 --> 02:33:25,940
So I've almost forgotten.

3875
02:33:27,160 --> 02:33:29,940
Loser this gets fifth and are out.

3876
02:33:30,180 --> 02:33:30,980
Oh, okay.

3877
02:33:31,080 --> 02:33:33,240
So then yeah, it's gonna be them versus whoever.

3878
02:33:33,500 --> 02:33:35,640
Whoever wins the other loser bracket, right?

3879
02:33:35,760 --> 02:33:36,900
And then we fight them.

3880
02:33:36,920 --> 02:33:37,720
And then we fight them.

3881
02:33:37,780 --> 02:33:38,400
Who's in the...

3882
02:33:38,400 --> 02:33:41,080
Okay, so out of all four teams...

3883
02:33:41,080 --> 02:33:41,720
I cannot believe that hit the wall.

3884
02:33:41,940 --> 02:33:42,240
Jeez.

3885
02:33:43,100 --> 02:33:43,560
Right?

3886
02:33:43,700 --> 02:33:47,780
I don't even know who is in losers right now.

3887
02:33:47,980 --> 02:33:49,280
I mean, obviously Fii.

3888
02:33:49,460 --> 02:33:50,500
It's Fii versus Kaiser.

3889
02:33:52,040 --> 02:33:55,040
Fii, Kaiser, and then Miles and MYK.

3890
02:33:55,560 --> 02:33:59,160
Oh, and Maz is like fucking destroying Scar right now.

3891
02:33:59,920 --> 02:34:01,700
He's destroying this man, yeah.

3892
02:34:01,980 --> 02:34:03,200
Fucking hate him, Maz.

3893
02:34:04,940 --> 02:34:07,300
Alyssa is a crack character.

3894
02:34:07,720 --> 02:34:13,580
Like, when Matt loses to Maz, that's supposed to be a 60-40, I think, for Jack.

3895
02:34:14,180 --> 02:34:16,300
But that's why it hurts more when you lose.

3896
02:34:16,580 --> 02:34:18,780
And you got the favorable matchup a little bit.

3897
02:34:18,820 --> 02:34:19,400
Just a little bit.

3898
02:34:19,740 --> 02:34:20,220
Yeah.

3899
02:34:20,500 --> 02:34:22,160
But I just didn't know the matchup last time.

3900
02:34:22,260 --> 02:34:23,220
I've gone and studied.

3901
02:34:23,440 --> 02:34:24,040
Oh, yeah, yeah.

3902
02:34:24,200 --> 02:34:24,940
But now we do, so we win.

3903
02:34:25,060 --> 02:34:26,820
Bro Pro actually coached him this time.

3904
02:34:26,960 --> 02:34:28,120
I saw it with my own hands.

3905
02:34:28,120 --> 02:34:28,900
Parentheses, I will still lose.

3906
02:34:29,180 --> 02:34:29,900
I saw it.

3907
02:34:31,260 --> 02:34:32,180
Doki was there.

3908
02:34:32,220 --> 02:34:32,740
She heard it.

3909
02:34:32,740 --> 02:34:33,060
Yeah, I'm the witness.

3910
02:34:33,060 --> 02:34:33,520
Oh, my God.

3911
02:34:33,740 --> 02:34:34,580
Fucking explosion.

3912
02:34:38,360 --> 02:34:41,420
Why is Scar getting hit by that hop kick like that?

3913
02:34:41,620 --> 02:34:43,300
Because no one knows Alyssa, bro.

3914
02:34:43,440 --> 02:34:46,540
What the fuck kind of character has a double-hitting hop kick?

3915
02:34:47,120 --> 02:34:48,660
Why is she always in the air?

3916
02:34:48,800 --> 02:34:49,780
Rip her wings out.

3917
02:34:50,340 --> 02:34:53,480
Like that shit happened to... no one's played Tekken 7 before in their life.

3918
02:34:53,600 --> 02:34:54,120
Let's be real here.

3919
02:34:54,400 --> 02:34:57,300
Everyone who's played Tekken 7 is old as fuck in your chat.

3920
02:34:57,580 --> 02:34:59,620
Whoa, who played Tekken 7?

3921
02:35:00,580 --> 02:35:01,760
Actually, I played Tekken 7.

3922
02:35:01,780 --> 02:35:02,200
Oh, okay.

3923
02:35:02,300 --> 02:35:03,100
So you're old as fuck.

3924
02:35:04,780 --> 02:35:06,780
I played it for like a hundred hours.

3925
02:35:07,080 --> 02:35:08,000
This has got to hurt.

3926
02:35:08,140 --> 02:35:11,120
Like being the guy that like... like if Scar loses this...

3927
02:35:11,120 --> 02:35:11,160
Oh, whoa.

3928
02:35:11,680 --> 02:35:13,940
Like the cup doesn't knock you out of the tournament.

3929
02:35:14,120 --> 02:35:15,400
You're out of... you know what I mean?

3930
02:35:15,480 --> 02:35:15,820
Yeah.

3931
02:35:16,300 --> 02:35:17,080
That's got to suck.

3932
02:35:17,520 --> 02:35:18,220
Oh, my God.

3933
02:35:18,460 --> 02:35:18,860
Oh, my God.

3934
02:35:19,880 --> 02:35:20,820
That's... uh-oh.

3935
02:35:20,940 --> 02:35:24,680
Dude, I am telling you that team is fucking godlike.

3936
02:35:24,940 --> 02:35:25,300
No.

3937
02:35:26,980 --> 02:35:30,220
Yeah, but then they still have to fight the other... the other two.

3938
02:35:31,080 --> 02:35:32,060
Or like the other what?

3939
02:35:32,220 --> 02:35:32,580
Team.

3940
02:35:33,740 --> 02:35:34,100
Yeah.

3941
02:35:35,080 --> 02:35:36,500
I think I can take a Moz now.

3942
02:35:37,880 --> 02:35:39,020
I know you can take him.

3943
02:35:39,500 --> 02:35:41,260
I shouldn't have lost the first one, but...

3944
02:35:42,420 --> 02:35:43,600
Yeah, you can absolutely win.

3945
02:35:43,760 --> 02:35:46,240
Could be a Scar situation where he fucks on me, you know?

3946
02:35:46,240 --> 02:35:49,920
Oh, remember at the wall, he loves that down four one plus two.

3947
02:35:50,720 --> 02:35:52,640
Scar doesn't know how to punish, so that sucks for him.

3948
02:35:53,580 --> 02:35:56,960
Wait, so how do I block the slide from Law again?

3949
02:35:57,360 --> 02:36:01,980
You just block... when he's mid-range and crouching from mid-range, he's probably going to do it.

3950
02:36:02,060 --> 02:36:03,460
Then you just... you just down back.

3951
02:36:03,720 --> 02:36:04,340
Down back.

3952
02:36:04,540 --> 02:36:04,900
Okay.

3953
02:36:05,060 --> 02:36:07,620
Yeah, you block low and then you mash four.

3954
02:36:07,820 --> 02:36:09,280
Just like Yoshi.

3955
02:36:09,920 --> 02:36:10,280
Okay.

3956
02:36:10,780 --> 02:36:13,360
And then he'll go in the air and then you can decide what to do after.

3957
02:36:13,360 --> 02:36:14,980
It's not enough time to tell you.

3958
02:36:16,660 --> 02:36:18,620
But technically that's supposed to lead into a combo.

3959
02:36:18,860 --> 02:36:20,620
If you block the slide, it's supposed to be a combo.

3960
02:36:21,040 --> 02:36:21,360
Alley kick will punish it.

3961
02:36:21,840 --> 02:36:23,620
When you block it, spam alley kick.

3962
02:36:24,240 --> 02:36:24,600
Oh.

3963
02:36:24,600 --> 02:36:25,020
If you want.

3964
02:36:25,220 --> 02:36:25,800
There you go.

3965
02:36:25,920 --> 02:36:26,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3966
02:36:26,400 --> 02:36:27,140
Spam alley kick.

3967
02:36:27,340 --> 02:36:27,620
Okay.

3968
02:36:27,660 --> 02:36:29,580
All I do is just spam alley kick, so okay.

3969
02:36:29,960 --> 02:36:30,380
Yeah, yeah.

3970
02:36:30,440 --> 02:36:30,760
Block it.

3971
02:36:30,760 --> 02:36:32,340
Oh, when you block it, it's coming?

3972
02:36:33,200 --> 02:36:37,080
Block it if you think it's coming, and then afterwards, spam the fuck out of alley kick.

3973
02:36:39,920 --> 02:36:41,500
Oh, he might win from this.

3974
02:36:41,760 --> 02:36:43,260
Dude, look how many times he does the fucking...

3975
02:36:43,720 --> 02:36:44,940
I'm telling you, man.

3976
02:36:45,220 --> 02:36:45,600
Yeah.

3977
02:36:45,760 --> 02:36:48,340
It's the most flow chart Alyssa I've ever seen in my life.

3978
02:36:51,420 --> 02:36:52,220
I wonder if they talk shit.

3979
02:36:52,220 --> 02:36:53,220
Isn't it annoying when you...

3980
02:36:53,220 --> 02:36:54,720
Dude, I'm sure they do.

3981
02:36:54,800 --> 02:36:57,080
Because like you and I were talking last night, you know?

3982
02:36:57,140 --> 02:36:58,400
Like I fucking...

3983
02:36:58,400 --> 02:36:59,640
You know how I feel.

3984
02:36:59,800 --> 02:37:02,780
Dude, all this fucking jackdaws and spam grabs, like you got...

3985
02:37:03,680 --> 02:37:07,180
I know they said all I do is spam grabs too at some point.

3986
02:37:07,320 --> 02:37:08,480
But we're playing King.

3987
02:37:08,480 --> 02:37:09,060
You're King!

3988
02:37:09,200 --> 02:37:09,480
That's all we do.

3989
02:37:10,160 --> 02:37:11,420
That's fucking mad shit.

3990
02:37:11,740 --> 02:37:13,120
We are talking mad shit.

3991
02:37:13,120 --> 02:37:13,580
I know.

3992
02:37:13,760 --> 02:37:14,100
100%.

3993
02:37:14,100 --> 02:37:14,780
Everybody does.

3994
02:37:16,140 --> 02:37:21,140
I already told my chat that like at least like... at least Apex supports tournaments.

3995
02:37:23,140 --> 02:37:24,940
Oh my god, the damage, dude.

3996
02:37:26,520 --> 02:37:27,280
Victory is insane.

3997
02:37:27,280 --> 02:37:28,920
Oh, the 1-1 needs to be ducked.

3998
02:37:30,580 --> 02:37:31,860
Look at that gray life.

3999
02:37:32,640 --> 02:37:33,160
Oh!

4000
02:37:33,680 --> 02:37:34,200
Oh!

4001
02:37:35,020 --> 02:37:35,880
Oh my god.

4002
02:37:35,920 --> 02:37:37,060
Oh, Skarad doesn't know.

4003
02:37:37,160 --> 02:37:37,920
He blocked.

4004
02:37:39,240 --> 02:37:40,200
Oh my goodness.

4005
02:37:40,480 --> 02:37:41,180
Okay, he got it.

4006
02:37:41,180 --> 02:37:41,400
Wait.

4007
02:37:41,400 --> 02:37:42,400
Signs of life.

4008
02:37:42,400 --> 02:37:42,840
Wait a minute.

4009
02:37:42,840 --> 02:37:43,580
Wait a minute.

4010
02:37:44,000 --> 02:37:44,640
Signs of life.

4011
02:37:44,640 --> 02:37:45,020
8 hours!

4012
02:37:45,760 --> 02:37:46,700
He's waking up!

4013
02:37:46,740 --> 02:37:47,200
He's waking up!

4014
02:37:52,030 --> 02:37:52,490
Almost.

4015
02:37:55,150 --> 02:37:56,830
Those are four highs in a row.

4016
02:38:00,050 --> 02:38:01,010
That's minus 14.

4017
02:38:01,870 --> 02:38:02,790
That low mid.

4018
02:38:03,630 --> 02:38:04,830
That's like minus 30.

4019
02:38:05,950 --> 02:38:07,210
I went in the replay system.

4020
02:38:10,250 --> 02:38:11,350
Oh my god.

4021
02:38:11,590 --> 02:38:12,830
Goodbye, Skarad.

4022
02:38:13,470 --> 02:38:13,930
Oh.

4023
02:38:13,930 --> 02:38:14,450
Goodbye.

4024
02:38:14,570 --> 02:38:15,190
It's over.

4025
02:38:15,550 --> 02:38:16,130
It's over.

4026
02:38:16,130 --> 02:38:17,190
At least he knows how I felt.

4027
02:38:17,950 --> 02:38:18,750
It's over.

4028
02:38:19,330 --> 02:38:20,570
He knows how I felt.

4029
02:38:21,610 --> 02:38:22,410
Goodbye, MYK.

4030
02:38:22,530 --> 02:38:25,410
This is the first team where it's not a coach match, right?

4031
02:38:25,750 --> 02:38:26,290
Yeah, yeah.

4032
02:38:26,390 --> 02:38:27,350
They were able to 3-0.

4033
02:38:28,410 --> 02:38:29,350
Damn, that's gotta hurt.

4034
02:38:29,370 --> 02:38:31,130
To be fair, they had to play against... what's his name?

4035
02:38:31,190 --> 02:38:31,370
Roy?

4036
02:38:32,530 --> 02:38:34,510
Roy Chihata, which is a free win for them.

4037
02:38:35,090 --> 02:38:35,490
Yeah.

4038
02:38:37,230 --> 02:38:41,990
It feels like a lot of like... a lot of the tiers have a free win in their tier.

4039
02:38:42,510 --> 02:38:42,910
Yeah.

4040
02:38:42,910 --> 02:38:43,550
You know what I mean?

4041
02:38:43,610 --> 02:38:45,170
Like they got the first seed.

4042
02:38:45,450 --> 02:38:47,110
Roy Chihata, they got the third seed.

4043
02:38:47,510 --> 02:38:48,370
You guys got me.

4044
02:38:48,710 --> 02:38:50,150
Not Zico, but you know.

4045
02:38:50,290 --> 02:38:50,870
Let's be real.

4046
02:38:51,190 --> 02:38:51,790
Talk your shit.

4047
02:38:52,050 --> 02:38:52,790
Let's be real.

4048
02:38:57,690 --> 02:38:58,410
All right.

4049
02:38:58,510 --> 02:39:00,050
And we're playing next, right?

4050
02:39:00,890 --> 02:39:02,110
No, I think it's them.

4051
02:39:02,250 --> 02:39:06,030
The person who just won, KawaiiFaceMiles versus whoever won FDX.

4052
02:39:06,250 --> 02:39:08,830
Oh, so it was two loser brackets and then us.

4053
02:39:08,870 --> 02:39:09,250
I don't know.

4054
02:39:09,350 --> 02:39:09,810
Is it?

4055
02:39:09,810 --> 02:39:10,710
Oh, they're going all the way up?

4056
02:39:10,770 --> 02:39:11,070
Okay.

4057
02:39:11,350 --> 02:39:11,890
Oh, okay.

4058
02:39:12,030 --> 02:39:12,390
I'm not sure.

4059
02:39:12,390 --> 02:39:12,430
I'm not sure.

4060
02:39:12,430 --> 02:39:12,450
I'm not sure.

4061
02:39:12,450 --> 02:39:12,510
I'm not sure.

4062
02:39:13,710 --> 02:39:14,570
Is this a bracket?

4063
02:39:14,770 --> 02:39:15,250
Yeah, yeah.

4064
02:39:15,310 --> 02:39:15,530
Okay.

4065
02:39:15,590 --> 02:39:16,450
So KFM just won.

4066
02:39:16,550 --> 02:39:18,750
FDX versus Kaiser is going to happen and then we're fighting them.

4067
02:39:19,270 --> 02:39:19,650
Okay.

4068
02:39:23,150 --> 02:39:24,170
Or... or not.

4069
02:39:24,190 --> 02:39:24,670
No, wait.

4070
02:39:24,710 --> 02:39:25,730
We have to wait for all the streams.

4071
02:39:25,830 --> 02:39:25,970
They were playing at the same time.

4072
02:39:26,050 --> 02:39:28,010
Both loser brackets, we're playing at the same time.

4073
02:39:28,450 --> 02:39:29,730
I'm just fucking stupid.

4074
02:39:29,970 --> 02:39:30,730
They're playing...

4075
02:39:30,730 --> 02:39:32,230
We're going to fight Tone's, right?

4076
02:39:32,290 --> 02:39:33,130
We're fighting Tone's team.

4077
02:39:33,290 --> 02:39:33,450
Yeah.

4078
02:39:33,450 --> 02:39:35,590
After that, we'll fight whoever wins this.

4079
02:39:36,650 --> 02:39:37,790
Assuming we lose quarter.

4080
02:39:37,790 --> 02:39:39,550
Assuming we lose, which we shouldn't.

4081
02:39:40,050 --> 02:39:40,430
Yeah.

4082
02:39:40,610 --> 02:39:42,490
Because Kony is going to clutch it for us.

4083
02:39:42,490 --> 02:39:43,910
I might.

4084
02:39:44,750 --> 02:39:45,810
I mean, I might.

4085
02:39:46,290 --> 02:39:46,750
True?

4086
02:39:47,530 --> 02:39:49,990
FDX versus Monkey D Animal.

4087
02:39:50,990 --> 02:39:51,970
Oh, Eddie, moment.

4088
02:39:52,130 --> 02:39:52,550
Oh my God.

4089
02:39:53,890 --> 02:39:54,790
Oh my God.

4090
02:39:55,070 --> 02:39:55,690
All right.

4091
02:39:55,730 --> 02:39:57,310
Well, we can all tap out of this one.

4092
02:39:57,550 --> 02:39:57,770
Okay.

4093
02:39:57,890 --> 02:39:58,670
We have that.

4094
02:39:59,110 --> 02:39:59,570
Okay.

4095
02:40:00,730 --> 02:40:03,630
Here, the bracket, I guess I can post it in our chat.

4096
02:40:03,910 --> 02:40:04,330
Okay.

4097
02:40:10,250 --> 02:40:10,970
There you go.

4098
02:40:14,650 --> 02:40:17,310
What's the score on the other...

4099
02:40:17,310 --> 02:40:17,610
The other...

4100
02:40:17,630 --> 02:40:18,250
Loser bracket.

4101
02:40:20,310 --> 02:40:22,830
Does anyone know what the score is on the other loser bracket?

4102
02:40:23,110 --> 02:40:24,010
Or is it in the...

4103
02:40:24,010 --> 02:40:25,290
Oh, it's in the challenge.

4104
02:40:25,710 --> 02:40:26,150
Okay.

4105
02:40:26,350 --> 02:40:26,610
Yeah.

4106
02:40:26,730 --> 02:40:27,250
The challenge.

4107
02:40:27,570 --> 02:40:28,010
Challenge.

4108
02:40:28,090 --> 02:40:28,530
Challenge.

4109
02:40:29,550 --> 02:40:31,890
I didn't know people used challenge still.

4110
02:40:32,610 --> 02:40:33,390
They didn't even update it.

4111
02:40:33,390 --> 02:40:34,490
They didn't even update it.

4112
02:40:36,850 --> 02:40:37,710
Womp womp.

4113
02:40:38,030 --> 02:40:39,250
I don't know who's winning.

4114
02:40:40,650 --> 02:40:41,990
Chat, who's winning right now?

4115
02:40:42,730 --> 02:40:43,550
I don't know.

4116
02:40:43,670 --> 02:40:44,250
They don't have the over rank.

4117
02:40:44,250 --> 02:40:44,770
V or Kaiser.

4118
02:40:46,810 --> 02:40:47,370
Don't worry.

4119
02:40:47,410 --> 02:40:47,610
My chat is winning.

4120
02:40:47,610 --> 02:40:48,690
Chat will stream snipe for me.

4121
02:40:49,690 --> 02:40:50,830
Oh, they pulled up the overlay.

4122
02:40:51,670 --> 02:40:52,250
Oh, nice.

4123
02:40:52,410 --> 02:40:52,590
Oh, wait.

4124
02:40:52,630 --> 02:40:53,150
It's the wrong one.

4125
02:40:53,310 --> 02:40:53,450
Oh.

4126
02:40:53,450 --> 02:40:54,350
Oh, what the fuck?

4127
02:40:55,310 --> 02:40:58,810
Yo, FD6 is on Eddy, not Zaf.

4128
02:40:59,730 --> 02:41:01,810
Yeah, but he was Zaf against BoxBox.

4129
02:41:01,990 --> 02:41:03,230
I think it's just literally a toss up.

4130
02:41:03,230 --> 02:41:04,090
Oh, V is winning apparently.

4131
02:41:04,490 --> 02:41:04,650
Dude.

4132
02:41:05,810 --> 02:41:06,170
V is team.

4133
02:41:06,170 --> 02:41:07,170
Do you know about the 3-3-3?

4134
02:41:07,670 --> 02:41:08,030
Yeah.

4135
02:41:08,170 --> 02:41:08,610
Not really.

4136
02:41:09,210 --> 02:41:11,150
What the fuck do you mean not really, dude?

4137
02:41:11,810 --> 02:41:12,850
What the fuck do you mean?

4138
02:41:12,910 --> 02:41:13,630
What the fuck do you mean?

4139
02:41:13,690 --> 02:41:14,490
We never went over it.

4140
02:41:15,670 --> 02:41:17,270
Bro, but you've watched the thread.

4141
02:41:17,270 --> 02:41:18,110
That three guy.

4142
02:41:18,290 --> 02:41:19,070
No, I did not.

4143
02:41:19,130 --> 02:41:21,370
I watched him for like five seconds.

4144
02:41:21,510 --> 02:41:22,050
I was like, oh, no.

4145
02:41:22,270 --> 02:41:23,090
And then I fucking clicked off.

4146
02:41:23,090 --> 02:41:24,310
That's all you need, bro.

4147
02:41:24,470 --> 02:41:24,990
That's all you need.

4148
02:41:24,990 --> 02:41:25,850
No, it is not.

4149
02:41:25,930 --> 02:41:26,470
Look at him go.

4150
02:41:26,550 --> 02:41:27,890
He's fucking going nasty with it.

4151
02:41:30,290 --> 02:41:30,990
Is he really?

4152
02:41:31,130 --> 02:41:32,770
No, he's not spamming threes anymore.

4153
02:41:33,130 --> 02:41:33,690
Oh, God.

4154
02:41:38,340 --> 02:41:39,200
He's so fly.

4155
02:41:40,540 --> 02:41:43,120
Isn't it like there's a fucking high somewhere or some shit?

4156
02:41:48,680 --> 02:41:49,420
No punish.

4157
02:41:49,920 --> 02:41:51,380
This guy just doesn't know the matchup.

4158
02:41:51,720 --> 02:41:52,100
I'm not gonna play.

4159
02:41:52,100 --> 02:41:53,460
Rest in peace, shifter.

4160
02:42:10,530 --> 02:42:16,430
We're currently just watching the Sagem stream because we're not playing yet.

4161
02:42:17,530 --> 02:42:18,630
We're not playing yet.

4162
02:42:18,690 --> 02:42:23,790
So we're just watching who's going to win up this matchup.

4163
02:42:24,170 --> 02:42:25,450
What a copy past it.

4164
02:42:25,490 --> 02:42:28,870
To be fair, you have to have very high IQ to press 3S3D.

4165
02:42:29,070 --> 02:42:32,510
The timing is extremely subtle and with a solid grasp of frame data.

4166
02:42:32,710 --> 02:42:34,250
Most of the kicks were with.

4167
02:42:34,470 --> 02:42:35,790
There's also 3D.

4168
02:42:35,790 --> 02:42:40,570
He's optimistic outlook, which is definitely woven into his kicks.

4169
02:42:40,750 --> 02:42:45,550
His personal philosophy draws heavily from Jose literature.

4170
02:42:45,850 --> 02:42:49,010
For instance, the fans understand this stuff.

4171
02:42:49,150 --> 02:42:58,350
The intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the difficulty of hitting the combo to realize that it's not just hard.

4172
02:43:02,320 --> 02:43:03,520
Okay, that's good.

4173
02:43:03,740 --> 02:43:04,960
Whoever wrote that.

4174
02:43:05,100 --> 02:43:08,100
Sorry, I had to go watch a clip of MYK going home.

4175
02:43:08,120 --> 02:43:08,760
The whole thing was going off on me.

4176
02:43:10,300 --> 02:43:11,420
It was funny.

4177
02:43:11,880 --> 02:43:12,520
It's not...

4178
02:43:12,520 --> 02:43:13,060
It's just not hard.

4179
02:43:13,060 --> 02:43:14,000
I feel so bad for MYK.

4180
02:43:14,520 --> 02:43:16,060
Getting third in the last one.

4181
02:43:16,420 --> 02:43:16,860
Going...

4182
02:43:16,860 --> 02:43:18,060
Fighting you again.

4183
02:43:18,240 --> 02:43:18,940
Losing again.

4184
02:43:19,060 --> 02:43:19,400
Now out.

4185
02:43:19,520 --> 02:43:20,540
Like, fuck man.

4186
02:43:21,780 --> 02:43:23,180
Guys, you just don't understand.

4187
02:43:23,300 --> 02:43:23,440
Yeah.

4188
02:43:23,440 --> 02:43:24,380
Hey, it's on Skara.

4189
02:43:24,500 --> 02:43:25,340
It's not even on me.

4190
02:43:25,520 --> 02:43:26,640
Skara let him down.

4191
02:43:27,200 --> 02:43:28,020
Drew, Drew, Drew?

4192
02:43:29,020 --> 02:43:30,840
He's a very difficult character.

4193
02:43:31,140 --> 02:43:32,340
You guys are just jealous.

4194
02:43:34,860 --> 02:43:37,340
Well, they made new fan art for us.

4195
02:43:37,400 --> 02:43:38,100
That one is pretty good.

4196
02:43:38,100 --> 02:43:38,540
This is pretty cool too.

4197
02:43:38,720 --> 02:43:39,040
Damn.

4198
02:43:39,280 --> 02:43:40,260
These guys are crazy.

4199
02:43:40,680 --> 02:43:41,420
They retweeted it.

4200
02:43:42,220 --> 02:43:43,140
There's another one.

4201
02:43:43,560 --> 02:43:44,640
I have to find it.

4202
02:43:44,680 --> 02:43:45,540
There's new Fanheart?

4203
02:43:46,040 --> 02:43:47,840
Yeah, this one's really cool too.

4204
02:43:48,000 --> 02:43:49,080
Oh, they retweeted it already.

4205
02:43:49,260 --> 02:43:52,340
Oh, the one where we were wearing the Jaguar hats.

4206
02:43:53,980 --> 02:43:54,420
Yeah!

4207
02:43:55,380 --> 02:43:58,340
If I had more time, I wanted to make one of those...

4208
02:43:58,340 --> 02:44:01,300
Have you guys seen that LeBron James scream if you love...

4209
02:44:01,300 --> 02:44:02,420
I want to do that.

4210
02:44:02,480 --> 02:44:04,200
Scream if you love Team Brawl Pro.

4211
02:44:04,380 --> 02:44:06,600
When he points up, that's the Jack Jesus throw.

4212
02:44:06,600 --> 02:44:07,560
You know what I mean?

4213
02:44:08,340 --> 02:44:10,800
When he punches his teammate, those are the alley kicks.

4214
02:44:11,040 --> 02:44:12,060
Just boom, boom, boom.

4215
02:44:12,600 --> 02:44:14,680
I wanted to make it, but I didn't have time.

4216
02:44:14,800 --> 02:44:15,940
It would have been so fucking good.

4217
02:44:17,760 --> 02:44:21,080
I'm not uploading tomorrow because this is too much stress.

4218
02:44:22,840 --> 02:44:25,220
You're taking your first day off in two years.

4219
02:44:25,400 --> 02:44:25,660
Oh my god.

4220
02:44:26,320 --> 02:44:28,460
All it took was techin' A.

4221
02:44:28,460 --> 02:44:28,820
Finally!

4222
02:44:30,500 --> 02:44:33,020
I took a day off the first LAMP too, like afterwards.

4223
02:44:35,880 --> 02:44:36,580
Oh my god.

4224
02:44:36,600 --> 02:44:36,840
Oh dude.

4225
02:44:38,320 --> 02:44:41,240
Why did they just tune into him getting smoked?

4226
02:44:41,480 --> 02:44:41,640
Yeah.

4227
02:44:47,360 --> 02:44:51,840
Oh man, if you do make it, the scream for Scream if you love Team Brawl Pro is Doki.

4228
02:44:52,080 --> 02:44:52,500
Yeah!

4229
02:44:53,940 --> 02:44:54,460
That's the one.

4230
02:44:55,720 --> 02:44:56,620
That's my shit, bro.

4231
02:45:03,620 --> 02:45:04,460
We've been added.

4232
02:45:04,620 --> 02:45:05,700
It's time to play.

4233
02:45:05,700 --> 02:45:06,240
It's time?

4234
02:45:06,340 --> 02:45:08,240
But what about the other loser bracket?

4235
02:45:08,920 --> 02:45:10,060
Let's fucking get it.

4236
02:45:10,560 --> 02:45:10,980
Oh!

4237
02:45:12,120 --> 02:45:13,400
Okay, we gotta wait for the lobby.

4238
02:45:21,010 --> 02:45:23,090
Alright guys, it's almost time.

4239
02:45:38,460 --> 02:45:40,100
Guys, today I'm gonna learn...

4240
02:45:40,100 --> 02:45:41,640
Will Super be featured in the Brawl Pro edit?

4241
02:45:41,780 --> 02:45:43,260
We could do something about cutting him.

4242
02:45:44,280 --> 02:45:45,140
Cutting Super?

4243
02:45:45,320 --> 02:45:45,600
I don't know.

4244
02:45:45,820 --> 02:45:48,480
Did you see when Super was trying to help the ops?

4245
02:45:48,540 --> 02:45:49,280
He was helping SK.

4246
02:45:49,460 --> 02:45:49,980
Just like...

4247
02:45:49,980 --> 02:45:50,520
No, really?

4248
02:45:50,520 --> 02:45:51,360
You know like his moments?

4249
02:45:51,840 --> 02:45:54,940
I told him he's uninvited to the EVO party if he's the reason.

4250
02:45:55,500 --> 02:45:56,380
That's insane.

4251
02:45:56,820 --> 02:45:58,680
No, during his moments, just like...

4252
02:45:58,680 --> 02:46:02,000
Like, crop my picture and put it on his face.

4253
02:46:02,260 --> 02:46:03,460
Yeah, just everywhere you go.

4254
02:46:03,640 --> 02:46:03,740
Yeah.

4255
02:46:05,480 --> 02:46:06,760
That's insane, dude.

4256
02:46:08,480 --> 02:46:09,920
He's not going to dinner with us.

4257
02:46:10,020 --> 02:46:10,480
Fuck that.

4258
02:46:11,280 --> 02:46:12,060
That's crazy.

4259
02:46:13,940 --> 02:46:14,960
Yeah, we saw him.

4260
02:46:15,020 --> 02:46:15,540
There's VODs.

4261
02:46:15,720 --> 02:46:16,680
He was training SK.

4262
02:46:21,710 --> 02:46:22,950
I was like, how dare you?

4263
02:46:23,270 --> 02:46:25,010
But then it didn't actually end up mattering.

4264
02:46:25,030 --> 02:46:26,170
Yeah, cause...

4265
02:46:26,630 --> 02:46:29,010
You know, that SK might come in and fight us.

4266
02:46:29,570 --> 02:46:30,770
If we lose to Toad.

4267
02:46:31,430 --> 02:46:32,230
Oh shit.

4268
02:46:32,330 --> 02:46:34,150
Yeah, if we lose to Toad and they win.

4269
02:46:34,550 --> 02:46:35,650
Alright, he's uninvited.

4270
02:46:43,310 --> 02:46:45,330
Yeah, Fia and KFM are fighting.

4271
02:46:45,450 --> 02:46:47,850
So if Fia wins, then I have to fight SK.

4272
02:46:48,910 --> 02:46:50,490
What is exclamation mark snack?

4273
02:46:50,810 --> 02:46:51,410
Do I get one?

4274
02:46:52,370 --> 02:46:53,430
Is that the snack box?

4275
02:46:54,270 --> 02:46:54,950
I don't know.

4276
02:46:55,110 --> 02:46:55,610
I can't...

4277
02:46:55,610 --> 02:46:56,050
I mean...

4278
02:46:56,050 --> 02:46:57,150
I got one for free.

4279
02:46:58,730 --> 02:46:59,130
Yeah.

4280
02:47:00,070 --> 02:47:01,750
I don't even know the prizes for this one.

4281
02:47:01,970 --> 02:47:03,750
Honestly, other than the top two, I don't know.

4282
02:47:03,750 --> 02:47:04,030
I don't...

4283
02:47:04,030 --> 02:47:04,950
Like, what do we get for third?

4284
02:47:06,270 --> 02:47:07,110
A controller?

4285
02:47:07,290 --> 02:47:07,950
I think a controller.

4286
02:47:08,830 --> 02:47:09,710
I'm pretty sure.

4287
02:47:24,200 --> 02:47:25,960
Guys, I'm ready to get my ass kicked.

4288
02:47:26,120 --> 02:47:26,520
Guys.

4289
02:47:28,120 --> 02:47:31,840
I'm ready to be shown that...

4290
02:47:33,280 --> 02:47:37,100
I'm ready, I'm ready to fucking be on the floor.

4291
02:47:39,760 --> 02:47:41,600
Try to get one round.

4292
02:47:41,860 --> 02:47:42,600
Goal, guys.

4293
02:47:42,720 --> 02:47:46,140
Our goal today is to get one round off of SK.

4294
02:47:49,680 --> 02:47:51,980
That's the dream right there.

4295
02:47:57,880 --> 02:47:59,040
Wait, can I get that?

4296
02:47:59,500 --> 02:48:02,440
Wait, what do you text?

4297
02:48:08,070 --> 02:48:08,670
Alright.

4298
02:48:14,460 --> 02:48:16,820
Oh, they're texting something for a prize.

4299
02:48:17,140 --> 02:48:18,720
We're just waiting for a lobby right now.

4300
02:48:19,120 --> 02:48:19,720
Chat.

4301
02:48:25,100 --> 02:48:26,620
I only kick ease.

4302
02:48:27,300 --> 02:48:29,080
If I can get to him.

4303
02:48:33,320 --> 02:48:35,980
If I can fucking reach him.

4304
02:48:40,220 --> 02:48:42,000
He's so fucking fast.

4305
02:48:42,160 --> 02:48:44,520
I don't even know if I can reach him in time.

4306
02:48:46,900 --> 02:48:48,600
Don't think, feel, true, true.

4307
02:48:48,820 --> 02:48:50,020
That was my issue.

4308
02:48:50,120 --> 02:48:51,020
I kept thinking.

4309
02:48:51,960 --> 02:48:53,180
Like, when I win...

4310
02:48:53,200 --> 02:48:55,240
Don't think I win every game.

4311
02:48:55,460 --> 02:48:56,620
It's actually crazy.

4312
02:48:57,140 --> 02:48:59,080
I just need to fucking...

4313
02:48:59,080 --> 02:48:59,760
Stop.

4314
02:49:03,440 --> 02:49:04,400
I need...

4315
02:49:05,040 --> 02:49:06,420
Like, no thoughts.

4316
02:49:06,540 --> 02:49:07,120
Head empty.

4317
02:49:07,220 --> 02:49:09,040
That's how I win my games.

4318
02:49:09,340 --> 02:49:10,160
I literally...

4319
02:49:10,160 --> 02:49:11,260
How I won.

4320
02:49:16,830 --> 02:49:17,810
No brain.

4321
02:49:17,990 --> 02:49:18,730
Only grab.

4322
02:49:18,870 --> 02:49:19,270
True.

4323
02:49:20,050 --> 02:49:20,650
True.

4324
02:49:22,050 --> 02:49:23,590
I just need to do that.

4325
02:49:29,240 --> 02:49:29,840
Oh.

4326
02:49:30,060 --> 02:49:31,540
There's the lobby code.

4327
02:49:32,840 --> 02:49:33,780
Alright guys.

4328
02:49:33,900 --> 02:49:35,400
I will hide my screen.

4329
02:49:37,860 --> 02:49:41,000
Because they're doing that thing where there's a password.

4330
02:49:41,320 --> 02:49:43,200
So you can't complain that I leaked.

4331
02:49:45,340 --> 02:49:46,020
Ummm.

4332
02:49:47,260 --> 02:49:47,940
Okay.

4333
02:49:48,320 --> 02:49:48,500
It's...

4334
02:49:51,580 --> 02:49:52,260
It's...

4335
02:49:53,460 --> 02:49:54,140
It's...

4336
02:49:54,140 --> 02:49:54,360
It's...

4337
02:49:54,360 --> 02:49:55,400
It's 5 4 3 4.

4338
02:49:55,700 --> 02:49:56,220
Guys.

4339
02:49:56,220 --> 02:49:58,040
If you wanna join the lobby.

4340
02:49:58,160 --> 02:49:59,760
That is the code.

4341
02:50:00,500 --> 02:50:01,260
So true.

4342
02:50:03,920 --> 02:50:04,600
I'm in.

4343
02:50:06,480 --> 02:50:07,980
I'm ready to get destroyed.

4344
02:50:12,320 --> 02:50:13,560
Kony just showed it.

4345
02:50:13,660 --> 02:50:14,140
Oh my god.

4346
02:50:14,200 --> 02:50:15,100
If Kony just showed it.

4347
02:50:15,140 --> 02:50:15,580
What's the point?

4348
02:50:23,400 --> 02:50:24,220
What's the point?

4349
02:50:24,320 --> 02:50:25,280
He already showed it.

4350
02:50:31,460 --> 02:50:33,560
What the fuck is the point?

4351
02:50:35,480 --> 02:50:36,760
Thanks Kony.

4352
02:50:39,080 --> 02:50:39,760
Alright.

4353
02:50:42,480 --> 02:50:43,160
Ohhhhh.

4354
02:50:43,860 --> 02:50:44,540
AHHHHHHHH.

4355
02:50:50,160 --> 02:50:51,360
Is everybody in?

4356
02:50:51,640 --> 02:50:53,520
2 4 2 3.

4357
02:50:53,800 --> 02:50:54,300
Oh wait.

4358
02:50:54,520 --> 02:50:57,420
We don't even have like majority of players in here.

4359
02:51:01,100 --> 02:51:01,780
Ah.

4360
02:51:02,140 --> 02:51:02,820
Ahhhhh.

4361
02:51:05,260 --> 02:51:05,940
Wait.

4362
02:51:06,020 --> 02:51:07,440
That's not 5 4 3.

4363
02:51:07,440 --> 02:51:09,020
They changed it guys.

4364
02:51:09,080 --> 02:51:10,480
They changed the passcode last minute.

4365
02:51:10,600 --> 02:51:12,440
It was 5 4 3 4.

4366
02:51:12,500 --> 02:51:15,160
When I was putting the password in guys.

4367
02:51:15,300 --> 02:51:17,280
They just changed it last second chat.

4368
02:51:17,460 --> 02:51:18,540
You just didn't see it.

4369
02:51:18,700 --> 02:51:20,120
Cause my screen was hidden.

4370
02:51:21,940 --> 02:51:22,440
Hahahaha.

4371
02:51:25,280 --> 02:51:27,500
It was such a fast password change.

4372
02:51:27,800 --> 02:51:28,160
Cause they're like.

4373
02:51:28,280 --> 02:51:28,760
Oh my god.

4374
02:51:28,820 --> 02:51:29,880
Kony leaked the password.

4375
02:51:30,160 --> 02:51:31,740
So then they changed it guys.

4376
02:51:34,060 --> 02:51:35,220
They changed it.

4377
02:51:35,260 --> 02:51:35,960
Before we could.

4378
02:51:36,060 --> 02:51:36,360
You know.

4379
02:51:37,900 --> 02:51:40,000
Before I could tell you guys the new password.

4380
02:51:45,680 --> 02:51:46,480
I would never.

4381
02:51:46,940 --> 02:51:49,100
How dare you guys think I would lie.

4382
02:51:51,020 --> 02:51:52,940
Doki would never do that to you.

4383
02:51:54,500 --> 02:51:56,020
Doki is the way of life.

4384
02:51:56,600 --> 02:51:59,460
The first commandment in the Doki lore.

4385
02:51:59,760 --> 02:52:01,300
Is thou shalt not lie.

4386
02:52:02,940 --> 02:52:04,180
And by that I mean.

4387
02:52:04,220 --> 02:52:05,440
You guys shouldn't lie to me.

4388
02:52:06,120 --> 02:52:06,620
Hahahaha.

4389
02:52:07,240 --> 02:52:07,740
Alright.

4390
02:52:08,580 --> 02:52:09,620
Here we go again.

4391
02:52:10,180 --> 02:52:10,680
AHHHHHHHH.

4392
02:52:10,680 --> 02:52:10,900
Let's go.

4393
02:52:10,920 --> 02:52:11,440
Let's get it fellows.

4394
02:52:11,940 --> 02:52:12,460
Here we go.

4395
02:52:13,020 --> 02:52:14,540
They said don't start.

4396
02:52:14,840 --> 02:52:15,140
Oh.

4397
02:52:15,280 --> 02:52:15,840
Okay.

4398
02:52:18,740 --> 02:52:19,720
It's okay guys.

4399
02:52:19,820 --> 02:52:21,080
I'm like the appetizer.

4400
02:52:21,220 --> 02:52:22,840
Before the main meal.

4401
02:52:23,460 --> 02:52:24,020
Hahahaha.

4402
02:52:28,560 --> 02:52:29,120
Uhhhh.

4403
02:52:30,320 --> 02:52:31,000
Let's go.

4404
02:52:32,060 --> 02:52:32,620
Uhhhh.

4405
02:52:33,860 --> 02:52:34,520
It's okay.

4406
02:52:34,660 --> 02:52:36,340
Kony can watch me and just be like.

4407
02:52:36,420 --> 02:52:37,840
Okay I should not do that.

4408
02:52:37,840 --> 02:52:39,380
No I'll be inspired.

4409
02:52:39,580 --> 02:52:39,960
More kicks.

4410
02:52:41,760 --> 02:52:42,720
Lots of kicks.

4411
02:52:43,120 --> 02:52:44,180
I'll be James Chen.

4412
02:52:44,340 --> 02:52:45,160
The Chen destroyer.

4413
02:52:45,160 --> 02:52:45,320
True.

4414
02:52:46,140 --> 02:52:46,820
Oh my gosh.

4415
02:52:46,880 --> 02:52:47,120
Wait.

4416
02:52:47,260 --> 02:52:48,920
You're right our coach is in the interview.

4417
02:52:49,220 --> 02:52:50,500
He's not here to give us tips.

4418
02:52:50,580 --> 02:52:51,780
He's too busy in an interview.

4419
02:52:53,240 --> 02:52:53,640
Hahahaha.

4420
02:52:53,640 --> 02:52:53,780
Hahahaha.

4421
02:52:57,620 --> 02:52:58,820
Oh my god coach.

4422
02:52:58,860 --> 02:52:59,080
Wait what the fuck.

4423
02:52:59,260 --> 02:53:00,280
This guy is labbing against me.

4424
02:53:00,280 --> 02:53:00,560
Hold on.

4425
02:53:00,740 --> 02:53:01,700
Get this guy.

4426
02:53:02,060 --> 02:53:02,460
Hahahaha.

4427
02:53:05,920 --> 02:53:07,080
Oh my god.

4428
02:53:08,060 --> 02:53:08,460
Oh my god.

4429
02:53:12,780 --> 02:53:13,980
I can't believe it.

4430
02:53:14,530 --> 02:53:16,220
The coaches aren't even here.

4431
02:53:16,500 --> 02:53:17,500
To coach us.

4432
02:53:17,820 --> 02:53:18,680
What do I do?

4433
02:53:19,260 --> 02:53:19,920
Hahahaha.

4434
02:53:21,120 --> 02:53:21,780
Hahahaha.

4435
02:53:22,440 --> 02:53:23,700
Stop hitting join.

4436
02:53:23,940 --> 02:53:24,600
Never.

4437
02:53:26,560 --> 02:53:27,220
Never.

4438
02:53:28,580 --> 02:53:30,020
I'm gonna join forever.

4439
02:53:32,040 --> 02:53:33,280
It's not my fault.

4440
02:53:35,060 --> 02:53:36,700
I can't believe it.

4441
02:53:37,520 --> 02:53:38,960
You're doing an interview.

4442
02:53:39,040 --> 02:53:39,340
Stop.

4443
02:53:40,740 --> 02:53:42,220
I'm more important.

4444
02:53:43,180 --> 02:53:43,760
Hahahaha.

4445
02:53:45,340 --> 02:53:45,920
Hahahaha.

4446
02:53:45,920 --> 02:53:45,960
Hahahaha.

4447
02:53:49,080 --> 02:53:51,200
So how was the labbing going?

4448
02:53:51,720 --> 02:53:54,960
He like pulled up the replays I fought against him yesterday.

4449
02:53:55,300 --> 02:53:55,460
Hahahaha.

4450
02:53:56,180 --> 02:53:57,920
You should pull up the replays too.

4451
02:53:58,300 --> 02:53:59,860
I did before he did actually.

4452
02:54:00,400 --> 02:54:00,980
Hahahaha.

4453
02:54:03,060 --> 02:54:03,640
Hahahaha.

4454
02:54:03,660 --> 02:54:04,240
Alright.

4455
02:54:04,440 --> 02:54:06,100
Does anyone know where Yisam lives?

4456
02:54:06,220 --> 02:54:07,540
Can someone pull his plug?

4457
02:54:07,900 --> 02:54:08,440
Florida.

4458
02:54:08,940 --> 02:54:09,520
Hahahaha.

4459
02:54:09,540 --> 02:54:11,300
Don't talk Yisam.

4460
02:54:11,340 --> 02:54:12,540
This is a joke.

4461
02:54:12,780 --> 02:54:13,600
For legal reasons.

4462
02:54:14,100 --> 02:54:15,220
It's widely known.

4463
02:54:15,360 --> 02:54:19,520
For legal reasons, please don't go to Yisam's place.

4464
02:54:19,840 --> 02:54:20,340
No.

4465
02:54:20,340 --> 02:54:20,340
No.

4466
02:54:20,340 --> 02:54:20,340
No.

4467
02:54:20,340 --> 02:54:20,560
Hahahaha.

4468
02:54:22,180 --> 02:54:24,920
I just knew the right answer so I want a teacher to pick me.

4469
02:54:25,440 --> 02:54:25,940
Hahahaha.

4470
02:54:27,860 --> 02:54:28,500
It's okay.

4471
02:54:28,680 --> 02:54:36,380
But if suddenly there is a power outage in wherever Yisam lives in the district that he lives, we were not part of the problem.

4472
02:54:36,820 --> 02:54:37,320
Yeah.

4473
02:54:37,380 --> 02:54:37,560
Yeah.

4474
02:54:37,680 --> 02:54:38,180
Yeah.

4475
02:54:38,740 --> 02:54:39,240
Hahahaha.

4476
02:54:46,000 --> 02:54:47,060
Come on.

4477
02:54:53,880 --> 02:54:55,500
Are they still in the interview?

4478
02:54:55,860 --> 02:54:56,980
I guess they are.

4479
02:55:00,330 --> 02:55:02,950
For legal reasons, that was a joke.

4480
02:55:03,110 --> 02:55:05,170
And all I said was a power outage.

4481
02:55:05,170 --> 02:55:13,050
If God suddenly sent a power outage to Florida, then him losing was meant to be.

4482
02:55:14,090 --> 02:55:14,770
Hahahaha.

4483
02:55:16,070 --> 02:55:16,750
Hahahaha.

4484
02:55:17,470 --> 02:55:17,530
Hahahaha.

4485
02:55:17,910 --> 02:55:18,590
Hahahaha.

4486
02:55:18,930 --> 02:55:19,230
Hahahaha.

4487
02:55:19,330 --> 02:55:20,010
Hahahaha.

4488
02:55:22,440 --> 02:55:23,100
Hahahaha.

4489
02:55:23,260 --> 02:55:24,720
It was just meant to be.

4490
02:55:26,780 --> 02:55:27,640
True.

4491
02:55:28,060 --> 02:55:28,500
Hahahaha.

4492
02:55:33,320 --> 02:55:36,760
Jack Jesus, hear my prayers.

4493
02:55:38,040 --> 02:55:38,900
Hahahaha.

4494
02:55:39,340 --> 02:55:39,400
Hahahaha.

4495
02:55:39,660 --> 02:55:40,520
Hahahaha.

4496
02:55:40,520 --> 02:55:43,240
Have a rat chew the power cables.

4497
02:55:43,520 --> 02:55:44,380
Hahahaha.

4498
02:55:44,380 --> 02:55:46,780
Hear my prayers, Jack Jesus.

4499
02:55:47,240 --> 02:55:49,280
Send that rat in.

4500
02:55:50,220 --> 02:55:50,650
Amen.

4501
02:55:56,970 --> 02:55:57,830
Hahahaha.

4502
02:55:57,830 --> 02:55:58,430
Hahahaha.

4503
02:55:58,890 --> 02:55:59,490
Hahahaha.

4504
02:55:59,930 --> 02:56:01,670
Alright, sorry they pulled me in for an interview.

4505
02:56:02,830 --> 02:56:03,830
That's why I was gone.

4506
02:56:03,990 --> 02:56:05,150
What did you say about us?

4507
02:56:05,190 --> 02:56:06,010
Good things, right?

4508
02:56:07,590 --> 02:56:09,490
Uh, they didn't ask me anything about...

4509
02:56:10,430 --> 02:56:11,550
They just asked us some...

4510
02:56:11,550 --> 02:56:12,150
What?

4511
02:56:12,450 --> 02:56:15,230
They pulled you into an interview and didn't even ask about us?

4512
02:56:15,670 --> 02:56:15,970
What?

4513
02:56:16,210 --> 02:56:18,370
I mean, they kind of did.

4514
02:56:20,170 --> 02:56:20,950
They kind of did.

4515
02:56:20,950 --> 02:56:21,430
J.J.M is bald.

4516
02:56:22,330 --> 02:56:24,490
We talked about that, by the way.

4517
02:56:24,650 --> 02:56:25,730
Just so you know, Sly.

4518
02:56:26,030 --> 02:56:26,430
Really?

4519
02:56:27,010 --> 02:56:28,150
Yeah, for two minutes.

4520
02:56:29,630 --> 02:56:30,570
The truth.

4521
02:56:31,550 --> 02:56:32,070
Yup.

4522
02:56:32,890 --> 02:56:34,410
They can't censor us.

4523
02:56:34,890 --> 02:56:35,750
Alright, guys.

4524
02:56:37,030 --> 02:56:39,210
Let's see if I can pull a round off of this man.

4525
02:56:41,050 --> 02:56:41,750
Let's go.

4526
02:56:41,930 --> 02:56:44,470
He went to last game, last round against SK.

4527
02:56:45,270 --> 02:56:49,170
Yeah, but I feel like SK actually fucking trained...

4528
02:56:49,170 --> 02:56:50,050
Hahahaha.

4529
02:56:51,470 --> 02:56:55,370
Oh my god, I forgot everything you taught me about ducking.

4530
02:56:55,830 --> 02:56:56,650
Mid-range?

4531
02:56:56,870 --> 02:56:57,990
Or down and back?

4532
02:57:01,450 --> 02:57:02,850
Guys, I forgot everything.

4533
02:57:03,050 --> 02:57:04,170
I forgot everything!

4534
02:57:04,830 --> 02:57:06,130
That's okay, no thoughts!

4535
02:57:07,970 --> 02:57:09,450
That's how it always works.

4536
02:57:10,410 --> 02:57:11,210
Until today.

4537
02:57:11,590 --> 02:57:13,310
Wow, he really wants to go to EVO.

4538
02:57:13,350 --> 02:57:14,310
This guy really wants to go.

4539
02:57:14,530 --> 02:57:16,690
This guy really wants to go.

4540
02:57:17,290 --> 02:57:18,330
Good try, good try.

4541
02:57:19,110 --> 02:57:19,550
Hahaha.

4542
02:57:21,730 --> 02:57:23,730
You guys will deny it for me, right?

4543
02:57:24,710 --> 02:57:25,510
Yeah, of course.

4544
02:57:26,450 --> 02:57:27,450
Oh my god.

4545
02:57:28,130 --> 02:57:29,750
He's doing the down 2-3.

4546
02:57:29,850 --> 02:57:30,430
Oh my god.

4547
02:57:30,430 --> 02:57:31,390
What does that mean?

4548
02:57:33,530 --> 02:57:34,810
Nothing, don't listen to me.

4549
02:57:37,150 --> 02:57:38,090
He's very good.

4550
02:57:38,230 --> 02:57:39,070
It means he's very good.

4551
02:57:39,230 --> 02:57:40,150
Oh, that makes sense.

4552
02:57:40,350 --> 02:57:41,670
I can feel it right now.

4553
02:57:42,190 --> 02:57:42,650
Hahaha.

4554
02:57:44,350 --> 02:57:46,770
No, he's doing that thing.

4555
02:57:49,130 --> 02:57:50,790
Oh my god, please don't slide.

4556
02:57:52,130 --> 02:57:52,590
Hahaha.

4557
02:57:53,150 --> 02:57:53,550
Hahaha.

4558
02:57:54,390 --> 02:57:56,890
He is the online law player.

4559
02:57:57,210 --> 02:57:57,570
Hahaha.

4560
02:57:58,430 --> 02:57:59,990
We found him, he's real.

4561
02:58:01,910 --> 02:58:03,210
Oh my god.

4562
02:58:05,590 --> 02:58:07,750
ESAM fights like you owe him hair.

4563
02:58:08,370 --> 02:58:09,010
Hahaha.

4564
02:58:09,510 --> 02:58:10,150
Hahaha.

4565
02:58:11,710 --> 02:58:12,850
That's pretty good.

4566
02:58:13,710 --> 02:58:15,390
Back 3, back 3.

4567
02:58:15,410 --> 02:58:17,630
Back 3, here we go, here we go!

4568
02:58:17,850 --> 02:58:18,570
Back 3!

4569
02:58:19,610 --> 02:58:20,250
Boom!

4570
02:58:20,250 --> 02:58:20,590
Boom!

4571
02:58:24,110 --> 02:58:25,190
I did it!

4572
02:58:25,290 --> 02:58:25,910
It's over.

4573
02:58:26,430 --> 02:58:28,090
Alright, it's over.

4574
02:58:28,290 --> 02:58:29,990
End this game now, I won the round.

4575
02:58:30,290 --> 02:58:31,590
Just believe, just believe.

4576
02:58:31,930 --> 02:58:33,610
Oh no, he's doing that now.

4577
02:58:34,030 --> 02:58:34,410
Hahaha.

4578
02:58:37,450 --> 02:58:38,450
That's fucking right!

4579
02:58:39,130 --> 02:58:40,130
Fucking nerd.

4580
02:58:40,310 --> 02:58:41,850
Fucking nerd, he's not!

4581
02:58:42,230 --> 02:58:43,590
Nobody likes it!

4582
02:58:45,710 --> 02:58:47,010
Get his ass!

4583
02:58:47,370 --> 02:58:47,830
Leave!

4584
02:58:49,110 --> 02:58:49,730
Leave!

4585
02:58:49,730 --> 02:58:49,970
Leave!

4586
02:58:51,270 --> 02:58:51,750
Nobody!

4587
02:58:52,110 --> 02:58:52,790
Oh shit!

4588
02:58:54,210 --> 02:58:55,690
Oh no, he's doing that thing.

4589
02:58:56,950 --> 02:58:58,210
Oh no, no.

4590
02:58:58,510 --> 02:58:59,550
Oh, I like the idea.

4591
02:58:59,910 --> 02:59:00,550
Thank you.

4592
02:59:01,170 --> 02:59:02,170
I'm glad you do.

4593
02:59:02,330 --> 02:59:05,230
Oh shit.

4594
02:59:05,370 --> 02:59:06,490
Hey, I'm back on the side!

4595
02:59:06,870 --> 02:59:07,310
That's clean!

4596
02:59:07,930 --> 02:59:08,390
That's clean!

4597
02:59:10,010 --> 02:59:12,670
He's not dead, he's not dead.

4598
02:59:12,910 --> 02:59:13,410
He's not dead.

4599
02:59:14,290 --> 02:59:15,550
We need one more mix.

4600
02:59:15,970 --> 02:59:18,170
Oh, he's dead!

4601
02:59:19,730 --> 02:59:20,210
Oh my goodness.

4602
02:59:21,670 --> 02:59:22,810
You got it, you got it.

4603
02:59:22,890 --> 02:59:23,770
You can do this, you can do this, Doki.

4604
02:59:24,630 --> 02:59:25,430
It's not a fluke.

4605
02:59:26,330 --> 02:59:27,050
Are you sure?

4606
02:59:27,990 --> 02:59:29,170
I'm sure, I swear to god.

4607
02:59:29,890 --> 02:59:31,290
He took me back to the other side.

4608
02:59:31,390 --> 02:59:31,950
No, he knows!

4609
02:59:32,290 --> 02:59:33,610
Oh, he took me back to the side!

4610
02:59:33,710 --> 02:59:34,130
Thank god!

4611
02:59:39,680 --> 02:59:40,920
Let's fucking go, good shit!

4612
02:59:41,060 --> 02:59:41,860
Oh no, but...

4613
02:59:42,820 --> 02:59:43,500
Let's go, Ally.

4614
02:59:43,600 --> 02:59:46,000
No, he grabbed me!

4615
02:59:46,260 --> 02:59:49,320
Guys, I think he analyzed the situation.

4616
02:59:50,200 --> 02:59:50,940
Oh my god.

4617
02:59:51,680 --> 02:59:52,420
It doesn't matter.

4618
02:59:52,520 --> 02:59:53,860
I took two rounds!

4619
02:59:54,280 --> 02:59:55,900
You can block that, right?

4620
02:59:55,980 --> 02:59:56,740
If you hold back.

4621
02:59:57,040 --> 02:59:58,440
Does the slide?

4622
02:59:59,020 --> 03:00:00,540
No, it's guaranteed if he's faster.

4623
03:00:00,900 --> 03:00:01,700
Oh, is it?

4624
03:00:01,780 --> 03:00:02,280
Alright, nevermind.

4625
03:00:03,380 --> 03:00:03,920
Guys...

4626
03:00:03,920 --> 03:00:06,820
Honestly, you played that extremely well.

4627
03:00:06,980 --> 03:00:07,900
Oh my god.

4628
03:00:08,660 --> 03:00:10,360
Honestly, it's embarrassing for him.

4629
03:00:10,580 --> 03:00:11,740
Because he didn't get a perfect...

4630
03:00:13,450 --> 03:00:16,220
Honestly, I think if you just hold down, you win.

4631
03:00:16,700 --> 03:00:17,240
Really?

4632
03:00:18,200 --> 03:00:18,880
I'm serious.

4633
03:00:18,880 --> 03:00:20,260
I'm gonna do that then.

4634
03:00:20,500 --> 03:00:21,580
That's all he's doing.

4635
03:00:22,580 --> 03:00:26,340
All I'm saying is it's very embarrassing that he let me win two rounds.

4636
03:00:27,100 --> 03:00:30,180
Doki, remember we talked about you can low parry that slide too?

4637
03:00:30,240 --> 03:00:31,440
We talked about that.

4638
03:00:31,520 --> 03:00:32,860
You can do that.

4639
03:00:33,100 --> 03:00:34,500
The down forward square?

4640
03:00:35,360 --> 03:00:37,620
No, no, just down forward is the low parry.

4641
03:00:37,700 --> 03:00:38,580
Oh, down forward, okay.

4642
03:00:40,140 --> 03:00:42,100
Down forward, not down forward.

4643
03:00:42,280 --> 03:00:43,240
I don't wanna confuse you.

4644
03:00:43,240 --> 03:00:44,420
Just hold down and you'll block it.

4645
03:00:45,480 --> 03:00:47,040
Just hold down and you'll block it.

4646
03:00:47,040 --> 03:00:50,380
You almost beat him when he got so much free damage off that.

4647
03:00:50,440 --> 03:00:51,360
It was basically a free round.

4648
03:00:51,520 --> 03:00:51,860
Of course.

4649
03:00:52,480 --> 03:00:53,280
Dude, it's Pikachu!

4650
03:00:53,680 --> 03:00:54,620
Oh my god, it is!

4651
03:00:55,560 --> 03:00:57,460
Oh my god, Gary!

4652
03:00:57,460 --> 03:00:58,280
That's fine, it's still damage.

4653
03:00:58,600 --> 03:01:01,180
Wait, what the fuck?

4654
03:01:01,460 --> 03:01:02,660
Wait, he's actually adapting?

4655
03:01:03,460 --> 03:01:04,720
What is wrong with him?

4656
03:01:05,660 --> 03:01:06,440
A lot of things.

4657
03:01:08,220 --> 03:01:10,760
Who the fuck adapts in a fighting game?

4658
03:01:11,340 --> 03:01:12,180
What do we know?

4659
03:01:12,440 --> 03:01:12,960
I know!

4660
03:01:13,980 --> 03:01:14,860
Nice throw.

4661
03:01:17,040 --> 03:01:17,400
Does he duck?

4662
03:01:17,480 --> 03:01:18,560
Oh, he does duck now.

4663
03:01:19,240 --> 03:01:20,240
Duck lord.

4664
03:01:20,860 --> 03:01:21,360
Choo!

4665
03:01:22,800 --> 03:01:23,760
I'm scared!

4666
03:01:24,760 --> 03:01:25,980
Yeah, you should be.

4667
03:01:27,160 --> 03:01:29,400
Losing two rounds to a B2B?

4668
03:01:29,540 --> 03:01:29,820
Boom!

4669
03:01:30,740 --> 03:01:32,400
Go back to Smash Bros!

4670
03:01:35,280 --> 03:01:35,920
Close.

4671
03:01:39,260 --> 03:01:40,260
Oh shit.

4672
03:01:40,600 --> 03:01:42,600
I need to remember that he does...

4673
03:01:44,560 --> 03:01:45,640
Oh, he missed it.

4674
03:01:47,040 --> 03:01:48,020
Oh, okay.

4675
03:01:48,700 --> 03:01:50,840
Oh no, I wanted to rage art.

4676
03:01:53,200 --> 03:01:55,280
Oh, he hits me first.

4677
03:01:55,640 --> 03:01:56,360
Yeah!

4678
03:01:56,760 --> 03:01:57,160
Nice try.

4679
03:01:57,700 --> 03:01:58,620
It's a good shot.

4680
03:01:58,720 --> 03:01:59,140
Oh.

4681
03:02:05,120 --> 03:02:05,840
Oh.

4682
03:02:06,620 --> 03:02:07,960
He ducked it.

4683
03:02:08,840 --> 03:02:09,580
Oh, what?

4684
03:02:10,280 --> 03:02:11,480
I'm a dragon.

4685
03:02:11,480 --> 03:02:13,440
What is that move?

4686
03:02:14,120 --> 03:02:14,840
Grab.

4687
03:02:14,840 --> 03:02:15,100
Grab.

4688
03:02:16,300 --> 03:02:18,480
I've never seen it before in my life.

4689
03:02:18,780 --> 03:02:19,760
Oh, he gets that off?

4690
03:02:20,600 --> 03:02:23,660
If DSS was still hard to do, this man would be cooked right now.

4691
03:02:26,360 --> 03:02:26,800
Oh!

4692
03:02:27,400 --> 03:02:27,840
You know what?

4693
03:02:28,000 --> 03:02:32,580
I mean, like the fact that you even made him sweat, I felt it from his monitor.

4694
03:02:33,440 --> 03:02:34,600
You went last round.

4695
03:02:34,720 --> 03:02:35,360
Last round.

4696
03:02:35,420 --> 03:02:36,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4697
03:02:39,020 --> 03:02:40,140
You know what?

4698
03:02:40,740 --> 03:02:43,160
It's just embarrassing that he lost the two rounds there.

4699
03:02:43,160 --> 03:02:44,960
He had to change his stride.

4700
03:02:44,980 --> 03:02:45,940
He's not that much better.

4701
03:02:46,840 --> 03:02:48,000
Oh, I left the session!

4702
03:02:48,680 --> 03:02:49,480
Oops, okay.

4703
03:02:50,800 --> 03:02:51,460
Unironically, yeah.

4704
03:02:52,080 --> 03:02:53,660
I accidentally left the session.

4705
03:02:54,080 --> 03:02:54,520
No!

4706
03:02:56,060 --> 03:03:00,220
Remember, Kony, if he ever does the spinny low on you, mash four.

4707
03:03:00,760 --> 03:03:01,200
Right.

4708
03:03:01,420 --> 03:03:04,840
Also, if you think he's gonna do it, it's hop kickable, you know?

4709
03:03:05,280 --> 03:03:05,720
Yup.

4710
03:03:06,640 --> 03:03:09,920
And back 4-2-1 is a high.

4711
03:03:09,980 --> 03:03:11,480
The third hit is a high, right, Kony?

4712
03:03:11,760 --> 03:03:12,200
Mm-hmm.

4713
03:03:13,420 --> 03:03:14,440
But I'm gonna have to wait.

4714
03:03:14,580 --> 03:03:16,360
This is the last time I got fucked up because I got countered.

4715
03:03:16,380 --> 03:03:19,000
And we watched how Chensor beat him.

4716
03:03:19,220 --> 03:03:19,820
He did like...

4717
03:03:20,260 --> 03:03:22,740
He did like dick jabs into a down back 3.

4718
03:03:23,140 --> 03:03:24,400
He did shit like that.

4719
03:03:24,620 --> 03:03:25,400
Yeah, dick jab him.

4720
03:03:25,500 --> 03:03:25,900
Hella.

4721
03:03:26,000 --> 03:03:26,360
He'll win.

4722
03:03:27,200 --> 03:03:28,580
Oh, I didn't mean to pick this skin.

4723
03:03:28,800 --> 03:03:29,160
Hold on.

4724
03:03:30,660 --> 03:03:31,720
I don't think you can...

4725
03:03:31,720 --> 03:03:35,720
You can go back to the menu after.

4726
03:03:35,980 --> 03:03:36,640
Nah, it's cool.

4727
03:03:37,100 --> 03:03:38,580
Guys, it doesn't matter!

4728
03:03:38,880 --> 03:03:40,720
The other team leaked it already!

4729
03:03:41,060 --> 03:03:42,840
All the other teams leaked the code!

4730
03:03:44,240 --> 03:03:47,780
One reg Supa for every round you take off East Town!

4731
03:03:48,020 --> 03:03:50,520
Thank you for the Akahaka Supa reg!

4732
03:03:51,080 --> 03:03:52,300
Thank you!

4733
03:03:53,020 --> 03:03:54,620
He should be embarrassed.

4734
03:03:58,900 --> 03:04:01,240
He literally... I was looking at the Discord.

4735
03:04:01,440 --> 03:04:06,540
He was in the Sajam Slam Discord from morning to night yesterday.

4736
03:04:06,880 --> 03:04:07,880
Fucking practicing.

4737
03:04:07,880 --> 03:04:09,520
It was actually crazy.

4738
03:04:11,620 --> 03:04:13,140
It was actually crazy.

4739
03:04:13,140 --> 03:04:14,880
I was literally watching...

4740
03:04:14,880 --> 03:04:18,540
I was looking at the server and he was there just playing Tekken.

4741
03:04:18,720 --> 03:04:18,940
Okay.

4742
03:04:21,440 --> 03:04:22,220
What the fuck?

4743
03:04:22,220 --> 03:04:22,940
Oh, there you go.

4744
03:04:23,040 --> 03:04:23,200
See?

4745
03:04:23,360 --> 03:04:24,660
Went for the fucking stupid low.

4746
03:04:24,660 --> 03:04:25,040
Nice.

4747
03:04:25,220 --> 03:04:26,260
You got that shit.

4748
03:04:28,860 --> 03:04:29,900
That counter hit.

4749
03:04:30,020 --> 03:04:31,580
Oh, fuck.

4750
03:04:34,480 --> 03:04:35,320
Let's go Cody!

4751
03:04:35,760 --> 03:04:36,240
Nice.

4752
03:04:36,740 --> 03:04:37,420
Nice job.

4753
03:04:37,500 --> 03:04:37,880
Let's go.

4754
03:04:38,280 --> 03:04:38,760
Yeah!

4755
03:04:40,400 --> 03:04:41,500
Break his streak!

4756
03:04:41,680 --> 03:04:42,840
Oh my god.

4757
03:04:43,840 --> 03:04:45,000
Oh my god.

4758
03:04:45,000 --> 03:04:45,540
He's a dunker.

4759
03:04:49,100 --> 03:04:49,800
Oh my god.

4760
03:04:49,800 --> 03:04:50,760
What a counter hit, Cody.

4761
03:04:55,000 --> 03:04:56,240
Yeah, get the fuck up.

4762
03:04:57,040 --> 03:04:57,520
Nice.

4763
03:04:57,900 --> 03:04:58,380
Okay!

4764
03:04:58,700 --> 03:04:59,200
Oh, nice!

4765
03:05:00,100 --> 03:05:01,060
Hold back to get up.

4766
03:05:02,180 --> 03:05:02,660
Nice.

4767
03:05:02,780 --> 03:05:03,340
Wake up.

4768
03:05:03,800 --> 03:05:05,340
I'm like five seconds behind.

4769
03:05:06,680 --> 03:05:07,820
Yeah, I'm pretty behind too.

4770
03:05:07,900 --> 03:05:08,260
Nice.

4771
03:05:08,320 --> 03:05:09,440
Obviously he was left there.

4772
03:05:09,460 --> 03:05:10,040
Like obviously.

4773
03:05:10,600 --> 03:05:11,920
Oh, you got that.

4774
03:05:11,920 --> 03:05:13,000
I can only think about what's happening.

4775
03:05:13,260 --> 03:05:15,600
If I close my eyes I can see it.

4776
03:05:15,680 --> 03:05:18,980
Just close your eyes and think about it.

4777
03:05:19,840 --> 03:05:19,840
Just

4778
03:05:26,010 --> 03:05:30,890
close your eyes and think about it.

4779
03:05:30,890 --> 03:05:31,250
Oh.

4780
03:05:35,320 --> 03:05:36,620
Oh, what a hopkick!

4781
03:05:38,400 --> 03:05:39,360
I saw it!

4782
03:05:39,460 --> 03:05:40,360
It was cool!

4783
03:05:41,960 --> 03:05:43,700
It was fucking dope.

4784
03:05:43,940 --> 03:05:44,640
Oh my god.

4785
03:05:44,780 --> 03:05:46,420
If only I could see that live.

4786
03:05:46,840 --> 03:05:47,380
Oh!

4787
03:05:49,720 --> 03:05:50,120
Yeah.

4788
03:05:50,440 --> 03:05:51,560
When he does that low.

4789
03:05:52,060 --> 03:05:54,460
Yes, yes, yes, you're right.

4790
03:05:54,640 --> 03:05:54,660
Oh.

4791
03:06:00,860 --> 03:06:02,140
Free fucking time, man.

4792
03:06:04,740 --> 03:06:05,580
Back to get up.

4793
03:06:07,060 --> 03:06:07,820
That's free inhale.

4794
03:06:08,080 --> 03:06:08,280
Nope.

4795
03:06:11,440 --> 03:06:11,840
Yeah.

4796
03:06:12,100 --> 03:06:12,500
Fuck!

4797
03:06:12,540 --> 03:06:13,220
That's okay, that's okay.

4798
03:06:13,540 --> 03:06:15,440
Know what the fuck he's doing!

4799
03:06:15,660 --> 03:06:16,680
Way, way, way closer.

4800
03:06:17,940 --> 03:06:20,440
Yeah, definitely you have to play him a few times.

4801
03:06:20,440 --> 03:06:21,700
To get used to it, yeah.

4802
03:06:22,020 --> 03:06:22,420
Yeah.

4803
03:06:22,700 --> 03:06:26,320
Just like, even on hit, on block, just match forward once you see the move.

4804
03:06:26,320 --> 03:06:26,700
Right, yeah.

4805
03:06:27,000 --> 03:06:29,560
I'm not thinking fast enough.

4806
03:06:29,700 --> 03:06:32,980
Remember, Kony, after that grab, if he grabs you, just hold back to get up.

4807
03:06:33,000 --> 03:06:34,800
You got it.

4808
03:06:37,520 --> 03:06:37,920
Nice.

4809
03:06:38,160 --> 03:06:39,520
I mean, like, what a fucking move.

4810
03:06:41,820 --> 03:06:43,040
And he doesn't know how to get up right.

4811
03:06:43,340 --> 03:06:44,460
And he just fucking ducks.

4812
03:06:46,680 --> 03:06:47,840
Agent Kony Banks.

4813
03:06:49,240 --> 03:06:51,100
Oh, Kony!

4814
03:06:56,220 --> 03:06:57,020
Nice.

4815
03:06:57,420 --> 03:06:57,920
Nice.

4816
03:07:00,340 --> 03:07:01,140
Nice kick!

4817
03:07:01,140 --> 03:07:01,660
What a hop kick!

4818
03:07:01,700 --> 03:07:03,200
Oh my fucking goodness.

4819
03:07:03,540 --> 03:07:04,940
That's the real counterplay to that.

4820
03:07:05,180 --> 03:07:06,100
Let's go.

4821
03:07:06,300 --> 03:07:07,820
Let's go, Kony!

4822
03:07:09,600 --> 03:07:11,600
Get my revenge!

4823
03:07:17,020 --> 03:07:17,820
Nice.

4824
03:07:20,940 --> 03:07:21,540
Nice.

4825
03:07:21,540 --> 03:07:22,540
He's ducking hella.

4826
03:07:26,660 --> 03:07:27,640
Yeah, that wall.

4827
03:07:28,680 --> 03:07:29,280
Nice.

4828
03:07:29,660 --> 03:07:31,220
Does he get up correctly from shoulder?

4829
03:07:31,820 --> 03:07:32,860
He does not!

4830
03:07:33,780 --> 03:07:34,480
What's that make?

4831
03:07:34,560 --> 03:07:35,280
That's so low!

4832
03:07:36,400 --> 03:07:37,600
You're insane!

4833
03:07:38,940 --> 03:07:39,540
Fight!

4834
03:07:41,100 --> 03:07:41,700
Alright.

4835
03:07:41,700 --> 03:07:42,780
R1 start!

4836
03:07:45,620 --> 03:07:46,220
Nice!

4837
03:07:46,720 --> 03:07:47,820
That's such a good combo.

4838
03:07:48,620 --> 03:07:50,480
Coach, why didn't you teach me that combo?

4839
03:07:51,440 --> 03:07:52,060
I tried to.

4840
03:07:52,100 --> 03:07:53,380
You have trouble with it.

4841
03:07:54,200 --> 03:07:55,800
You can try hiding!

4842
03:07:56,140 --> 03:07:56,880
Oh my god!

4843
03:07:56,900 --> 03:07:58,560
He's got a giant swing at the wall!

4844
03:07:58,780 --> 03:07:59,180
Oh my god!

4845
03:07:59,180 --> 03:08:00,120
Take him to the wall!

4846
03:08:02,020 --> 03:08:04,480
Oh my god!

4847
03:08:05,120 --> 03:08:06,140
It's just a red Pikmin.

4848
03:08:06,240 --> 03:08:07,420
He's not even a flower Pikmin.

4849
03:08:07,560 --> 03:08:07,760
Yeah.

4850
03:08:13,920 --> 03:08:16,800
After you're running 3, Kony, you can hop kick this guy.

4851
03:08:16,900 --> 03:08:18,940
And also, he's not ducking.

4852
03:08:18,940 --> 03:08:20,600
So you can do Shining Wizards now.

4853
03:08:21,300 --> 03:08:22,340
Right, right, right.

4854
03:08:22,400 --> 03:08:22,600
Yeah.

4855
03:08:23,900 --> 03:08:28,660
But again, if you hit him with a running 3 from long range, he's gonna do d2 every time.

4856
03:08:28,680 --> 03:08:29,600
Well, that's what he's doing.

4857
03:08:29,860 --> 03:08:33,540
Yeah, literally the only time he didn't do it was that final, final hit.

4858
03:08:33,600 --> 03:08:36,140
Every time you hit plus frames, he does d2.

4859
03:08:37,720 --> 03:08:39,580
My read is plus frames hop kick.

4860
03:08:39,660 --> 03:08:40,740
But, you know, up to you, of course.

4861
03:08:41,000 --> 03:08:42,780
Get ready for the next battle!

4862
03:08:45,980 --> 03:08:47,300
Stone Kony Steve Austin.

4863
03:08:47,560 --> 03:08:48,780
Oh my god, look at him go.

4864
03:08:49,980 --> 03:08:50,340
Oh!

4865
03:08:51,560 --> 03:08:51,920
One.

4866
03:08:56,020 --> 03:08:58,560
Yeah, I mean, just fucking, it's as simple as that, really.

4867
03:08:59,640 --> 03:09:00,000
Oh my god.

4868
03:09:00,000 --> 03:09:00,800
That's up to you to make the adjustment.

4869
03:09:11,900 --> 03:09:12,260
Clean.

4870
03:09:15,700 --> 03:09:16,060
Oh.

4871
03:09:16,260 --> 03:09:16,920
Okay, okay, okay.

4872
03:09:17,080 --> 03:09:17,740
Yeah, okay.

4873
03:09:17,980 --> 03:09:20,280
That means that he's willing to rage art another time.

4874
03:09:20,340 --> 03:09:20,760
Just keep that in mind.

4875
03:09:20,760 --> 03:09:20,980
Yes.

4876
03:09:20,980 --> 03:09:21,280
Yeah.

4877
03:09:22,940 --> 03:09:24,640
That means that he will kill himself later.

4878
03:09:32,050 --> 03:09:32,930
Get a rage art here.

4879
03:09:34,410 --> 03:09:34,770
Right.

4880
03:09:34,770 --> 03:09:35,130
Fuck.

4881
03:09:35,370 --> 03:09:36,110
Yeah, I forgot.

4882
03:09:36,310 --> 03:09:36,590
Yeah.

4883
03:09:37,950 --> 03:09:38,410
That was like shit.

4884
03:09:38,490 --> 03:09:38,810
I know.

4885
03:09:38,870 --> 03:09:39,150
I know.

4886
03:09:39,150 --> 03:09:41,050
What I said wouldn't have worked, actually.

4887
03:09:41,210 --> 03:09:41,690
Oh, really?

4888
03:09:43,890 --> 03:09:44,550
Let's go, baby.

4889
03:09:48,270 --> 03:09:50,150
That low always beats my power crush.

4890
03:09:54,010 --> 03:09:54,830
Let's go, Kony!

4891
03:09:55,290 --> 03:09:56,130
Come on, Kony.

4892
03:10:00,170 --> 03:10:00,610
Yes!

4893
03:10:00,610 --> 03:10:02,010
Look at him go, man.

4894
03:10:02,090 --> 03:10:02,270
Yes!

4895
03:10:02,390 --> 03:10:05,130
Oh my god, nice jump kick!

4896
03:10:05,690 --> 03:10:07,090
Force that 50-50 in the corner.

4897
03:10:07,090 --> 03:10:08,490
Look, he's literally back to the corner.

4898
03:10:08,570 --> 03:10:08,930
What can he do?

4899
03:10:10,250 --> 03:10:10,650
Yes!

4900
03:10:10,810 --> 03:10:11,110
Yes!

4901
03:10:11,110 --> 03:10:11,890
Oh, look at him.

4902
03:10:11,950 --> 03:10:12,390
Look at him.

4903
03:10:12,510 --> 03:10:13,710
Yes for your life!

4904
03:10:13,850 --> 03:10:14,230
Oh, he's scheming!

4905
03:10:17,330 --> 03:10:18,430
Stop fucking running.

4906
03:10:19,250 --> 03:10:19,650
Fight.

4907
03:10:20,230 --> 03:10:20,630
Kill him.

4908
03:10:22,250 --> 03:10:22,650
No!

4909
03:10:22,950 --> 03:10:24,050
My goodness!

4910
03:10:24,550 --> 03:10:24,550
Kill him!

4911
03:10:25,650 --> 03:10:26,050
Oh!

4912
03:10:26,250 --> 03:10:27,710
I saw it now.

4913
03:10:27,750 --> 03:10:27,930
Yeah, baby!

4914
03:10:32,760 --> 03:10:33,560
Nice, Kony!

4915
03:10:33,560 --> 03:10:34,180
One alley for the fans.

4916
03:10:34,360 --> 03:10:35,100
He's mad.

4917
03:10:35,160 --> 03:10:35,360
Oh!

4918
03:10:35,360 --> 03:10:35,520
Oh!

4919
03:10:36,560 --> 03:10:37,080
What the fuck?

4920
03:10:37,280 --> 03:10:38,040
You are unreal.

4921
03:10:38,980 --> 03:10:40,120
That was insane!

4922
03:10:43,400 --> 03:10:45,460
I couldn't... Oh my god.

4923
03:10:47,060 --> 03:10:48,580
Guys, this is a real King play.

4924
03:10:57,660 --> 03:10:58,180
Oh!

4925
03:11:00,220 --> 03:11:01,120
Hey, baby!

4926
03:11:02,100 --> 03:11:02,740
It's okay.

4927
03:11:02,860 --> 03:11:03,200
It's alright.

4928
03:11:06,300 --> 03:11:06,820
Yeah.

4929
03:11:06,820 --> 03:11:07,340
Okay.

4930
03:11:07,920 --> 03:11:11,680
My read is next time you're even a little bit enraged, just mash it.

4931
03:11:11,740 --> 03:11:12,080
Fuck it.

4932
03:11:12,100 --> 03:11:12,620
Send it, dude.

4933
03:11:12,720 --> 03:11:12,800
Sure.

4934
03:11:13,000 --> 03:11:13,800
Yes, Kony.

4935
03:11:14,100 --> 03:11:15,720
Oh, I can't watch.

4936
03:11:15,800 --> 03:11:16,440
I'm so scared.

4937
03:11:17,640 --> 03:11:18,980
I'm closing my eyes.

4938
03:11:22,980 --> 03:11:24,300
Oh my god.

4939
03:11:24,420 --> 03:11:24,780
That's...

4940
03:11:24,780 --> 03:11:26,020
That swing is incredible.

4941
03:11:31,380 --> 03:11:32,080
That's fine.

4942
03:11:32,160 --> 03:11:32,640
Burned it easy.

4943
03:11:35,580 --> 03:11:36,540
There's no way.

4944
03:11:36,580 --> 03:11:37,480
My god!

4945
03:11:39,820 --> 03:11:41,280
Did he do it?

4946
03:11:47,490 --> 03:11:48,050
Yeah!

4947
03:11:49,370 --> 03:11:50,750
Fart folks!

4948
03:11:50,910 --> 03:11:53,070
A fag game!

4949
03:11:55,010 --> 03:11:56,690
Raid It's the Frog on...

4950
03:11:56,690 --> 03:11:59,370
Fuck Me String!

4951
03:11:59,430 --> 03:12:00,670
Over and over!

4952
03:12:00,830 --> 03:12:01,910
Over and over!

4953
03:12:02,050 --> 03:12:03,370
Get the fuck out of here!

4954
03:12:04,070 --> 03:12:06,810
Level 9 computer bullshit!

4955
03:12:07,210 --> 03:12:08,530
Raid It's the Frog on...

4956
03:12:08,530 --> 03:12:09,070
Dragon On?

4957
03:12:13,990 --> 03:12:18,290
Arcade Mode Last Fight Before Heihachi Bullshit!

4958
03:12:19,330 --> 03:12:20,470
I am better!

4959
03:12:23,330 --> 03:12:26,290
Oh my fucking god dude.

4960
03:12:26,470 --> 03:12:28,370
Oh my goodness gracious.

4961
03:12:34,110 --> 03:12:36,390
Holy shit man that was frustrating.

4962
03:12:36,750 --> 03:12:38,090
Speak your truth, Kony.

4963
03:12:38,890 --> 03:12:40,150
Yell it to the world!

4964
03:12:40,590 --> 03:12:43,370
Dude you are the gold for the adaptation man.

4965
03:12:43,610 --> 03:12:44,550
Holy shit.

4966
03:12:44,630 --> 03:12:46,610
I mean I've never seen something more beautiful in my life.

4967
03:12:47,170 --> 03:12:48,070
It's so hot.

4968
03:12:48,150 --> 03:12:51,590
Dude the last set that I lost was because of that thing you told me where I was getting counter hit.

4969
03:12:51,670 --> 03:12:52,870
If I just didn't get counter hit.

4970
03:12:53,330 --> 03:12:53,730
Yes.

4971
03:12:54,070 --> 03:12:56,570
I lost so much shit off that because I was trying too hard to implement it.

4972
03:12:57,870 --> 03:12:58,630
Fuck man.

4973
03:13:01,450 --> 03:13:02,010
Here we go.

4974
03:13:02,090 --> 03:13:02,750
You are actually crazy.

4975
03:13:07,000 --> 03:13:07,400
Namaste.

4976
03:13:08,660 --> 03:13:09,880
Let's fucking go slime dude.

4977
03:13:10,440 --> 03:13:11,540
Oh my god.

4978
03:13:11,840 --> 03:13:12,620
Let's fucking get it.

4979
03:13:12,840 --> 03:13:13,860
Go slime go.

4980
03:13:14,580 --> 03:13:15,660
We believe in you.

4981
03:13:19,470 --> 03:13:20,190
How hard was that?

4982
03:13:20,210 --> 03:13:22,290
How fast is your heart beating right now?

4983
03:13:24,390 --> 03:13:25,690
It's so frustrating.

4984
03:13:28,590 --> 03:13:30,610
Dragging all this is so frustrating bro.

4985
03:13:31,030 --> 03:13:33,670
I feel like you need a fucking drink after that.

4986
03:13:34,910 --> 03:13:36,330
I can't spectate.

4987
03:13:37,690 --> 03:13:38,470
Let's get it slime.

4988
03:13:38,850 --> 03:13:40,030
I'm gonna restream Kony.

4989
03:13:40,690 --> 03:13:41,810
It's not letting me in the lobby?

4990
03:13:41,930 --> 03:13:42,090
Okay.

4991
03:13:45,070 --> 03:13:46,710
Oh my god no it's Brian.

4992
03:13:50,210 --> 03:13:51,610
He's a dick punch man right?

4993
03:13:55,800 --> 03:13:56,720
Uh no.

4994
03:13:58,540 --> 03:14:00,320
He's the guy that goes dick dick dick dick dick.

4995
03:14:00,340 --> 03:14:01,480
Yeah he's a dick punch man.

4996
03:14:02,360 --> 03:14:03,820
And he sometimes goes cock.

4997
03:14:05,940 --> 03:14:06,860
Oh yeah.

4998
03:14:11,220 --> 03:14:12,140
Good shit.

4999
03:14:12,520 --> 03:14:12,980
Okay.

5000
03:14:14,100 --> 03:14:15,020
Good shit.

5001
03:14:15,460 --> 03:14:16,480
We wait for that.

5002
03:14:16,560 --> 03:14:16,920
Yeah.

5003
03:14:19,380 --> 03:14:20,240
We break it.

5004
03:14:20,240 --> 03:14:21,900
I forgot there was another move.

5005
03:14:22,320 --> 03:14:23,000
It's all good.

5006
03:14:23,100 --> 03:14:23,560
It's all good.

5007
03:14:23,980 --> 03:14:24,640
We're still up.

5008
03:14:30,760 --> 03:14:31,480
Radar happens.

5009
03:14:31,620 --> 03:14:32,300
That's just knowledge.

5010
03:14:33,520 --> 03:14:35,160
Slime recognize the wall splats.

5011
03:14:35,240 --> 03:14:36,960
You could have won after your back one wall splat.

5012
03:14:37,440 --> 03:14:37,840
Okay.

5013
03:14:41,620 --> 03:14:43,700
If the wall is on that side and your back one.

5014
03:14:43,820 --> 03:14:44,720
Just think about it.

5015
03:14:46,500 --> 03:14:47,180
Very close.

5016
03:14:47,180 --> 03:14:47,300
Oh shit.

5017
03:14:58,180 --> 03:14:58,660
Wow.

5018
03:15:05,200 --> 03:15:06,080
What a block.

5019
03:15:11,140 --> 03:15:12,460
That was a crazy block.

5020
03:15:24,320 --> 03:15:26,640
Send the rage art when he's about to win.

5021
03:15:26,700 --> 03:15:27,620
He's pressuring like that.

5022
03:15:27,700 --> 03:15:28,160
It will work.

5023
03:15:30,400 --> 03:15:30,880
Nice.

5024
03:16:03,280 --> 03:16:03,760
Nice.

5025
03:16:04,000 --> 03:16:04,640
Eat him.

5026
03:16:05,440 --> 03:16:06,400
Big dude.

5027
03:16:06,500 --> 03:16:06,700
Good.

5028
03:16:10,630 --> 03:16:11,390
Nice slime.

5029
03:16:11,390 --> 03:16:11,990
Good shit.

5030
03:16:24,710 --> 03:16:26,290
What was the orbital fucking hit me there?

5031
03:16:38,470 --> 03:16:39,030
That's fine.

5032
03:16:39,110 --> 03:16:39,310
That's fine.

5033
03:16:39,310 --> 03:16:39,570
That's fine.

5034
03:16:39,630 --> 03:16:40,010
That's fine.

5035
03:16:41,870 --> 03:16:44,550
Remember he does let the fucking rage art rip.

5036
03:16:44,670 --> 03:16:46,090
And I think you should rip it too.

5037
03:16:48,850 --> 03:16:49,950
You gotta set the tone.

5038
03:17:17,050 --> 03:17:17,450
Oh.

5039
03:17:18,290 --> 03:17:18,690
Nice.

5040
03:17:19,630 --> 03:17:20,030
Insane.

5041
03:17:25,760 --> 03:17:26,340
That's crazy.

5042
03:17:26,460 --> 03:17:26,860
That palm.

5043
03:17:26,940 --> 03:17:27,240
That shit.

5044
03:17:29,040 --> 03:17:29,840
Yeah it was a whiff punish.

5045
03:18:16,320 --> 03:18:17,200
Good shit.

5046
03:18:17,760 --> 03:18:18,200
Nice.

5047
03:18:18,400 --> 03:18:19,560
Damn that does a lot.

5048
03:18:19,720 --> 03:18:20,700
Oh my god.

5049
03:18:20,920 --> 03:18:22,240
That was such a good combo.

5050
03:18:22,660 --> 03:18:23,000
Fuck me.

5051
03:18:40,650 --> 03:18:41,050
Nice.

5052
03:18:47,680 --> 03:18:48,480
Good shit.

5053
03:18:48,760 --> 03:18:49,460
Good punish.

5054
03:18:53,920 --> 03:18:54,320
Nice!

5055
03:19:01,960 --> 03:19:03,280
Should have done an easier low.

5056
03:19:04,020 --> 03:19:05,060
Hellsweep was really dumb there.

5057
03:19:05,100 --> 03:19:05,560
He just reacted.

5058
03:19:06,980 --> 03:19:08,200
I don't know why I Hellsweeped.

5059
03:19:08,540 --> 03:19:09,140
It's all good.

5060
03:19:09,240 --> 03:19:09,500
Let it go.

5061
03:19:09,640 --> 03:19:10,040
It's okay.

5062
03:19:10,060 --> 03:19:10,140
It's okay.

5063
03:19:10,140 --> 03:19:10,620
It's all crushed down.

5064
03:19:10,620 --> 03:19:11,080
Forward one.

5065
03:19:11,160 --> 03:19:11,520
Slime.

5066
03:19:11,520 --> 03:19:12,140
Crushed down.

5067
03:19:12,220 --> 03:19:12,540
Forward one.

5068
03:19:12,600 --> 03:19:12,860
It's okay.

5069
03:19:54,630 --> 03:19:55,090
That's okay.

5070
03:19:55,210 --> 03:19:55,410
Nice try.

5071
03:19:55,410 --> 03:19:55,850
Nice try.

5072
03:19:55,930 --> 03:19:56,430
Good try, dude.

5073
03:19:56,430 --> 03:19:56,790
Nice try.

5074
03:19:56,910 --> 03:19:57,370
Nice try.

5075
03:19:59,930 --> 03:20:00,310
Alright.

5076
03:20:00,690 --> 03:20:01,690
I'm gonna try a bit.

5077
03:20:03,190 --> 03:20:05,830
Honestly, last night BoxBox beat the fuck out of me.

5078
03:20:06,130 --> 03:20:08,310
Use what he got you with, though.

5079
03:20:08,370 --> 03:20:09,290
Use what he got you with.

5080
03:20:09,470 --> 03:20:09,790
Yeah.

5081
03:20:10,470 --> 03:20:11,510
You got it this time, dude.

5082
03:20:11,930 --> 03:20:12,310
Yeah.

5083
03:20:12,890 --> 03:20:15,790
He showed his cards, so now you know exactly his moves.

5084
03:20:17,070 --> 03:20:18,130
Until he starts attacking.

5085
03:20:18,130 --> 03:20:18,970
I'll be right back.

5086
03:20:19,810 --> 03:20:20,190
Sorry.

5087
03:20:27,570 --> 03:20:29,950
Who won in the last coaches?

5088
03:20:30,130 --> 03:20:32,270
Did BrawlPro won or did their coach won?

5089
03:20:32,930 --> 03:20:34,090
During round robins.

5090
03:20:34,210 --> 03:20:35,330
I think it's 1-1 between the two of them.

5091
03:20:35,450 --> 03:20:35,790
Oh, okay.

5092
03:20:36,130 --> 03:20:36,610
Yeah.

5093
03:20:42,820 --> 03:20:43,520
It's time.

5094
03:20:43,660 --> 03:20:44,960
Make it to the coaches match.

5095
03:20:46,740 --> 03:20:48,400
Bring us to the coaches match.

5096
03:20:52,180 --> 03:20:52,860
Let's try.

5097
03:20:57,600 --> 03:20:59,200
I believe in you, Matt.

5098
03:21:01,040 --> 03:21:01,860
I will try.

5099
03:21:02,100 --> 03:21:02,880
Don't throw up.

5100
03:21:04,200 --> 03:21:05,180
I will also try.

5101
03:21:07,440 --> 03:21:08,860
There's a lot of things I'm trying here.

5102
03:21:36,710 --> 03:21:37,450
Good shit.

5103
03:21:37,590 --> 03:21:37,890
Okay.

5104
03:21:38,250 --> 03:21:39,370
That's how we started back up.

5105
03:21:40,230 --> 03:21:41,170
Still have heat, too.

5106
03:21:41,690 --> 03:21:42,090
Nice.

5107
03:21:45,230 --> 03:21:45,890
Good shit.

5108
03:21:45,970 --> 03:21:46,530
That's a lot of damage.

5109
03:21:51,500 --> 03:21:52,300
He got uprun.

5110
03:21:54,340 --> 03:21:55,100
Good shit.

5111
03:21:55,300 --> 03:21:55,700
Yeah.

5112
03:21:56,420 --> 03:21:56,820
Okay.

5113
03:21:56,820 --> 03:21:58,180
I'm gonna see this in... Jesus Christ.

5114
03:21:58,600 --> 03:22:00,060
I'm gonna see this in five seconds.

5115
03:22:00,240 --> 03:22:00,460
Whoa!

5116
03:22:00,580 --> 03:22:01,240
I saw it, too!

5117
03:22:02,160 --> 03:22:03,040
Round two.

5118
03:22:04,040 --> 03:22:05,740
Oh, we gotta launch those four two-stars.

5119
03:22:05,980 --> 03:22:06,580
Yeah, I know that.

5120
03:22:13,760 --> 03:22:14,240
Nice, two.

5121
03:22:15,540 --> 03:22:16,220
Keep it going.

5122
03:22:17,500 --> 03:22:17,940
Nice.

5123
03:22:19,820 --> 03:22:20,700
Round three.

5124
03:22:20,960 --> 03:22:22,400
I cannot believe that's saved.

5125
03:22:23,460 --> 03:22:23,760
Fight.

5126
03:22:26,020 --> 03:22:26,460
Fight.

5127
03:22:29,860 --> 03:22:30,760
What is this?

5128
03:22:30,760 --> 03:22:30,840
What is this?

5129
03:22:32,740 --> 03:22:34,120
What is this match?

5130
03:22:42,470 --> 03:22:43,410
Kill the Jack.

5131
03:22:44,110 --> 03:22:45,370
Keep on jacking it!

5132
03:22:46,490 --> 03:22:47,490
Jack it so good.

5133
03:22:48,790 --> 03:22:49,710
Jack it harder.

5134
03:22:49,930 --> 03:22:50,790
Jack it real good.

5135
03:22:51,210 --> 03:22:51,870
I'll do a sheet.

5136
03:22:53,390 --> 03:22:54,910
And you were worried.

5137
03:23:00,960 --> 03:23:02,820
I gotta pull up my Tony notes.

5138
03:23:05,020 --> 03:23:06,820
I gotta pull them up right now.

5139
03:23:07,140 --> 03:23:07,820
Sorry, coach.

5140
03:23:08,420 --> 03:23:09,200
Sorry, coach.

5141
03:23:09,320 --> 03:23:09,440
Sorry, coach.

5142
03:23:09,440 --> 03:23:09,800
Sorry, coach.

5143
03:23:09,800 --> 03:23:09,800
Sorry, coach.

5144
03:23:09,820 --> 03:23:10,380
Are you going in?

5145
03:23:11,040 --> 03:23:12,580
Are you gonna death fit or are you gonna...

5146
03:23:13,540 --> 03:23:15,260
No, we'll let her rock.

5147
03:23:15,940 --> 03:23:16,940
You got it, dude.

5148
03:23:17,080 --> 03:23:17,660
It's winners.

5149
03:23:17,840 --> 03:23:18,580
We'll let her rock.

5150
03:23:18,840 --> 03:23:21,080
You try to ice me like fucking Goichi, man.

5151
03:23:23,240 --> 03:23:24,780
Dragon Ball FighterZ all over again.

5152
03:23:24,840 --> 03:23:25,160
What'd you go back?

5153
03:23:25,160 --> 03:23:26,600
He's on his Goichi shit, bro!

5154
03:23:29,600 --> 03:23:30,980
He wants the switch sides.

5155
03:23:31,300 --> 03:23:31,840
I can't.

5156
03:23:31,860 --> 03:23:32,480
I can't.

5157
03:23:35,160 --> 03:23:35,840
That's crazy.

5158
03:23:58,880 --> 03:24:02,360
I'm gonna go back to the Okay.

5159
03:24:10,220 --> 03:24:11,180
Two more rounds.

5160
03:24:11,360 --> 03:24:11,880
Nice.

5161
03:24:14,600 --> 03:24:15,260
Okay, release.

5162
03:24:15,940 --> 03:24:16,680
That's fine.

5163
03:24:17,240 --> 03:24:18,000
Oh, no.

5164
03:24:18,060 --> 03:24:18,740
I took 30.

5165
03:24:20,460 --> 03:24:21,420
Oh, no.

5166
03:24:21,560 --> 03:24:22,960
I'm not to do 90.

5167
03:24:23,500 --> 03:24:24,960
Jack, Jesus, no.

5168
03:24:25,860 --> 03:24:26,680
Oh, shit.

5169
03:24:30,080 --> 03:24:31,000
Bouncer Jack.

5170
03:24:34,820 --> 03:24:35,800
We break it.

5171
03:24:35,820 --> 03:24:36,440
Oh, my God.

5172
03:24:36,460 --> 03:24:36,840
He's desperate.

5173
03:24:37,420 --> 03:24:43,680
Isn't it crazy how this round started with a 30% combo and all the life is back and she's dead?

5174
03:24:44,420 --> 03:24:45,500
Oh, my God.

5175
03:24:45,700 --> 03:24:46,900
Has anyone noticed?

5176
03:24:47,340 --> 03:24:49,580
Someone called the funeral to ask you.

5177
03:24:49,700 --> 03:24:49,960
Flash.

5178
03:24:49,960 --> 03:24:51,580
Oh, this is...

5179
03:24:51,580 --> 03:24:53,460
That's some rope.

5180
03:24:53,980 --> 03:24:56,280
You should just stand still.

5181
03:24:56,480 --> 03:24:57,420
It's sad now.

5182
03:24:57,780 --> 03:24:58,720
He's getting foolish.

5183
03:24:59,100 --> 03:25:00,440
No way.

5184
03:25:00,640 --> 03:25:02,340
The FD signifier slayer.

5185
03:25:02,560 --> 03:25:03,880
The slayer.

5186
03:25:04,280 --> 03:25:05,760
The skull crusher.

5187
03:25:06,140 --> 03:25:07,340
The Bart Simpson.

5188
03:25:07,980 --> 03:25:09,960
It's your own fault.

5189
03:25:10,020 --> 03:25:10,560
Oh, my God.

5190
03:25:11,120 --> 03:25:12,460
Oh, my God.

5191
03:25:12,880 --> 03:25:14,760
Get her off the phone.

5192
03:25:15,700 --> 03:25:16,420
Oh.

5193
03:25:17,220 --> 03:25:18,960
The Sharks are hungry.

5194
03:25:19,960 --> 03:25:20,440
The Sharks.

5195
03:25:20,440 --> 03:25:20,660
Stop the party.

5196
03:25:21,000 --> 03:25:22,580
Let's go to the Eiffel Tower instead.

5197
03:25:23,200 --> 03:25:24,040
Wait, wait, wait.

5198
03:25:26,320 --> 03:25:29,340
Matt, please don't try the wall run, brother.

5199
03:25:30,560 --> 03:25:32,480
He wants to do what you did, coach.

5200
03:25:32,560 --> 03:25:32,580
No.

5201
03:25:32,780 --> 03:25:33,240
Okay.

5202
03:25:34,780 --> 03:25:36,800
Maybe we got it too cocky here.

5203
03:25:37,020 --> 03:25:37,380
A little too cute.

5204
03:25:40,720 --> 03:25:41,640
Look, Matt.

5205
03:25:41,740 --> 03:25:43,360
There's a reason why you're not the coach.

5206
03:25:43,740 --> 03:25:44,660
He's a bonehead.

5207
03:25:45,480 --> 03:25:46,680
I really am.

5208
03:25:46,680 --> 03:25:47,120
I'm a cut.

5209
03:25:47,460 --> 03:25:48,040
I'm a donate.

5210
03:25:50,500 --> 03:25:51,180
He's stuck.

5211
03:25:51,800 --> 03:25:53,420
Flew too close to the sun.

5212
03:25:54,140 --> 03:25:54,620
Oh.

5213
03:25:54,820 --> 03:25:56,380
He's swinging, man.

5214
03:25:57,800 --> 03:25:58,740
I like the idea.

5215
03:26:05,890 --> 03:26:07,150
Oh, that's true.

5216
03:26:07,350 --> 03:26:10,750
My chat was like, we're just giving the coaches time to review his notes, you know?

5217
03:26:11,190 --> 03:26:13,810
We need proper needs for reading time.

5218
03:26:14,990 --> 03:26:15,750
Alright, my bad.

5219
03:26:17,350 --> 03:26:18,310
Fuck you.

5220
03:26:19,070 --> 03:26:19,630
Alright.

5221
03:26:19,810 --> 03:26:21,030
Well done, dude.

5222
03:26:21,850 --> 03:26:24,190
Fucking anchor of the fucking team, man.

5223
03:26:24,790 --> 03:26:25,870
He's just betting.

5224
03:26:26,290 --> 03:26:27,190
He's just betting.

5225
03:26:27,690 --> 03:26:31,630
Me and Koki with the water wings on in the kiddie pool, we're like, yay!

5226
03:26:36,050 --> 03:26:37,250
He did it!

5227
03:26:37,310 --> 03:26:37,650
Yippee!

5228
03:26:40,690 --> 03:26:42,490
Coach, coach, coach, coach!

5229
03:26:43,450 --> 03:26:44,010
Yeah.

5230
03:26:44,310 --> 03:26:45,330
Let's get it.

5231
03:26:46,230 --> 03:26:47,070
Get it, baby.

5232
03:26:48,310 --> 03:26:48,470
Let's get it, bro.

5233
03:26:48,690 --> 03:26:50,310
Let's get it, coach.

5234
03:26:50,750 --> 03:26:51,510
I love you, bro.

5235
03:26:51,690 --> 03:26:54,070
We love you.

5236
03:26:55,290 --> 03:26:56,750
Win or lose, we love you, brother.

5237
03:26:57,570 --> 03:26:58,710
That's all I needed to hear.

5238
03:27:00,190 --> 03:27:01,950
We love you win or lose, straight up.

5239
03:27:03,430 --> 03:27:04,170
Let's go, gamers.

5240
03:27:11,800 --> 03:27:13,560
What if he just doesn't pick Brian?

5241
03:27:14,660 --> 03:27:15,640
That would be freaky.

5242
03:27:15,920 --> 03:27:16,480
That would be a throw.

5243
03:27:23,050 --> 03:27:24,910
I'm gonna use the bathroom to help your back.

5244
03:27:30,730 --> 03:27:32,730
Get ready for the next battle.

5245
03:27:42,270 --> 03:27:42,630
Fight.

5246
03:28:16,150 --> 03:28:16,510
Oh!

5247
03:28:30,050 --> 03:28:30,810
What a comeback.

5248
03:28:30,810 --> 03:28:31,950
You're at one HP, by the way.

5249
03:28:32,050 --> 03:28:33,570
Just to be clear, you're at one HP.

5250
03:28:34,050 --> 03:28:35,170
You're fucking him, dude.

5251
03:28:35,250 --> 03:28:35,590
You're fucking him, dude.

5252
03:28:35,590 --> 03:28:36,030
Round two.

5253
03:28:36,850 --> 03:28:37,490
Fight.

5254
03:28:54,980 --> 03:28:55,620
Yup.

5255
03:28:55,720 --> 03:28:56,380
It's clean.

5256
03:28:57,320 --> 03:28:58,220
Good shit.

5257
03:28:58,320 --> 03:28:59,160
Turn that shit back.

5258
03:29:00,080 --> 03:29:00,800
Good shit.

5259
03:29:11,020 --> 03:29:11,660
Okay.

5260
03:29:11,840 --> 03:29:12,640
It's all good.

5261
03:29:14,340 --> 03:29:14,980
Ugh.

5262
03:29:19,100 --> 03:29:19,740
Fight.

5263
03:29:21,460 --> 03:29:22,100
Caw!

5264
03:29:24,060 --> 03:29:24,700
Heheheheh!

5265
03:29:24,800 --> 03:29:25,320
Caw!

5266
03:29:27,400 --> 03:29:28,040
Caw!

5267
03:29:41,000 --> 03:29:41,640
Caw!

5268
03:29:44,800 --> 03:29:45,580
He's a good job.

5269
03:29:46,620 --> 03:29:47,180
He's a good job.

5270
03:29:50,570 --> 03:29:50,970
Oops.

5271
03:29:54,510 --> 03:29:55,570
Hey, it's okay, BrawlPro.

5272
03:29:55,630 --> 03:29:55,910
It's okay.

5273
03:29:56,250 --> 03:29:57,050
I said oh.

5274
03:29:59,910 --> 03:30:01,510
Just making it close for content.

5275
03:30:02,670 --> 03:30:03,070
Fight.

5276
03:30:03,630 --> 03:30:03,750
Fight.

5277
03:30:05,250 --> 03:30:05,650
Caw!

5278
03:30:06,430 --> 03:30:06,830
Heheheheh!

5279
03:30:07,770 --> 03:30:08,490
Yeah, that's right.

5280
03:30:08,550 --> 03:30:09,410
Play that Tekken 8, dude.

5281
03:30:11,610 --> 03:30:12,010
Nice.

5282
03:30:13,370 --> 03:30:13,770
Yeah.

5283
03:30:14,030 --> 03:30:14,630
Driver's seat.

5284
03:30:15,030 --> 03:30:15,430
Yeah.

5285
03:30:15,430 --> 03:30:15,430
Driver's seat.

5286
03:30:18,150 --> 03:30:18,770
Driver's seat.

5287
03:30:18,870 --> 03:30:19,010
Driver's seat.

5288
03:30:19,010 --> 03:30:19,610
There you go, bro.

5289
03:30:20,350 --> 03:30:20,810
Nice.

5290
03:30:20,810 --> 03:30:20,990
Okay.

5291
03:30:23,810 --> 03:30:24,270
Oh!

5292
03:30:24,270 --> 03:30:25,570
You gotta step that.

5293
03:30:27,250 --> 03:30:27,710
Oh!

5294
03:30:28,150 --> 03:30:28,170
Oh!

5295
03:30:31,700 --> 03:30:32,500
Let's go, baby.

5296
03:30:32,880 --> 03:30:33,580
Nice job.

5297
03:30:33,640 --> 03:30:33,920
Nice job.

5298
03:30:34,200 --> 03:30:35,000
Good shit.

5299
03:30:35,180 --> 03:30:35,400
Yup.

5300
03:30:35,420 --> 03:30:36,160
We hold back here.

5301
03:30:36,420 --> 03:30:36,880
Boom.

5302
03:30:36,980 --> 03:30:37,580
Good shit.

5303
03:30:38,640 --> 03:30:40,200
He's so freaky.

5304
03:30:40,760 --> 03:30:41,220
Nice!

5305
03:30:41,260 --> 03:30:43,080
Five seconds behind, but nice!

5306
03:30:44,300 --> 03:30:44,760
Fight.

5307
03:30:45,840 --> 03:30:46,300
Caw!

5308
03:30:49,750 --> 03:30:50,810
I'm closing my eyes.

5309
03:30:59,970 --> 03:31:00,690
Nice, dog.

5310
03:31:20,140 --> 03:31:20,500
Okay.

5311
03:31:20,700 --> 03:31:21,220
That's alright.

5312
03:31:21,360 --> 03:31:21,900
Hey, that was close.

5313
03:31:22,400 --> 03:31:22,760
Okay.

5314
03:31:23,120 --> 03:31:23,860
Very close.

5315
03:31:24,100 --> 03:31:24,880
Very close, dude.

5316
03:31:24,980 --> 03:31:25,420
You can do it.

5317
03:31:27,100 --> 03:31:27,980
Just play your shit.

5318
03:31:28,820 --> 03:31:30,160
What advice can I give you?

5319
03:31:31,580 --> 03:31:31,940
Heheheheh!

5320
03:31:33,620 --> 03:31:35,280
Guys, you're so evenly matched.

5321
03:31:35,600 --> 03:31:35,900
Guys, you're so evenly matched.

5322
03:31:45,920 --> 03:31:47,960
Oh, that tone is extra sweaty.

5323
03:31:51,200 --> 03:31:51,580
Oh, that tone is extra sweaty.

5324
03:31:51,780 --> 03:31:53,060
Yeah, he got no wall there.

5325
03:31:53,200 --> 03:31:53,300
Yeah, he got no wall there.

5326
03:31:53,300 --> 03:31:54,180
So, I feel like you back out.

5327
03:31:55,000 --> 03:31:57,000
Get ready for the next battle.

5328
03:31:59,400 --> 03:32:00,320
I love you, BroPro!

5329
03:32:01,180 --> 03:32:02,920
God, it would be so funny if you accidentally picked the wrong key.

5330
03:32:02,920 --> 03:32:02,980
God, it would be so funny if you accidentally picked the wrong key.

5331
03:32:02,980 --> 03:32:03,740
Come on, BrotherBear.

5332
03:32:04,000 --> 03:32:04,740
This is easy.

5333
03:32:04,900 --> 03:32:05,980
It's actually honestly easy.

5334
03:32:06,180 --> 03:32:06,560
Yeah!

5335
03:32:08,160 --> 03:32:09,200
That's how we start the game!

5336
03:32:09,200 --> 03:32:11,180
Hands weren't on the controller yet!

5337
03:32:28,020 --> 03:32:28,980
Dick punch.

5338
03:32:29,540 --> 03:32:30,020
Okay!

5339
03:32:30,960 --> 03:32:31,920
That's a wall, right?

5340
03:32:32,700 --> 03:32:33,180
Jesus.

5341
03:32:33,760 --> 03:32:34,860
Wow, what a block.

5342
03:32:36,200 --> 03:32:40,250
Oh, that kills him here.

5343
03:32:41,810 --> 03:32:43,070
I mean, that was a good block.

5344
03:32:43,190 --> 03:32:44,470
That was a very good block.

5345
03:32:44,570 --> 03:32:44,650
Yeah.

5346
03:33:00,340 --> 03:33:01,300
Round two.

5347
03:33:02,320 --> 03:33:02,800
Fight.

5348
03:33:05,820 --> 03:33:06,300
Nice.

5349
03:33:06,600 --> 03:33:07,080
Nice.

5350
03:33:07,220 --> 03:33:07,700
Nice.

5351
03:33:34,210 --> 03:33:34,970
Oh, wow.

5352
03:33:35,610 --> 03:33:36,050
Oh, wow.

5353
03:33:36,110 --> 03:33:36,550
Oh, wow.

5354
03:33:36,550 --> 03:33:37,170
It's okay, dude.

5355
03:33:37,270 --> 03:33:37,890
You got it.

5356
03:33:38,110 --> 03:33:38,130
It's okay, dude.

5357
03:33:38,130 --> 03:33:38,130
You got it.

5358
03:33:40,210 --> 03:33:40,930
Let's go, baby!

5359
03:33:44,470 --> 03:33:44,910
Nice.

5360
03:33:45,070 --> 03:33:45,910
What a ducker.

5361
03:33:46,050 --> 03:33:46,610
Good kick.

5362
03:33:46,870 --> 03:33:47,070
What a noob.

5363
03:33:48,250 --> 03:33:49,110
Going through floor?

5364
03:33:54,150 --> 03:33:55,150
Put him on the wall?

5365
03:33:55,330 --> 03:33:55,670
Yeah!

5366
03:33:56,670 --> 03:33:58,270
There's another area?

5367
03:34:02,450 --> 03:34:04,010
Boom, boom, boom, boom.

5368
03:34:04,030 --> 03:34:04,070
Boom, boom, boom, boom.

5369
03:34:04,110 --> 03:34:06,290
I've never seen this area before.

5370
03:34:06,530 --> 03:34:07,310
Good shit, dude.

5371
03:34:07,450 --> 03:34:07,770
Yeah!

5372
03:34:09,130 --> 03:34:09,530
Yes!

5373
03:34:10,210 --> 03:34:10,990
Oh my god.

5374
03:34:11,010 --> 03:34:12,450
What a crazy two hit.

5375
03:34:12,570 --> 03:34:12,970
Jesus.

5376
03:34:13,230 --> 03:34:13,850
That's how we start it back up.

5377
03:34:13,890 --> 03:34:14,490
Oh my god.

5378
03:34:14,570 --> 03:34:14,970
Nice!

5379
03:34:15,690 --> 03:34:16,210
Watch it.

5380
03:34:16,250 --> 03:34:16,670
The RDC.

5381
03:34:16,830 --> 03:34:17,190
Oh, okay.

5382
03:34:17,270 --> 03:34:17,470
For sure.

5383
03:34:17,690 --> 03:34:18,930
Oh my god.

5384
03:34:18,990 --> 03:34:19,530
Look at that break.

5385
03:34:20,710 --> 03:34:22,310
Somebody needs to talk to the coach.

5386
03:34:22,970 --> 03:34:23,370
Oh.

5387
03:34:26,410 --> 03:34:27,630
Get up, Freaky Brian.

5388
03:34:29,430 --> 03:34:29,950
Fine.

5389
03:34:29,950 --> 03:34:30,570
It's a little bit.

5390
03:34:31,090 --> 03:34:31,610
Fine.

5391
03:34:35,410 --> 03:34:35,930
It's a little bit.

5392
03:34:49,340 --> 03:34:49,860
Yes!

5393
03:34:55,480 --> 03:34:56,780
Oh my goodness.

5394
03:34:57,060 --> 03:34:57,280
Oh my goodness.

5395
03:34:57,280 --> 03:34:57,400
Yes!

5396
03:34:58,680 --> 03:34:59,720
Let's go, dude!

5397
03:35:00,180 --> 03:35:01,280
Let's go!

5398
03:35:02,380 --> 03:35:03,320
Come on, baby!

5399
03:35:07,440 --> 03:35:07,960
Fight.

5400
03:35:11,220 --> 03:35:12,420
I'm gonna close my eyes.

5401
03:35:25,510 --> 03:35:26,410
Oh, he's him.

5402
03:35:26,890 --> 03:35:28,390
Wait, what the fuck?

5403
03:35:29,330 --> 03:35:30,630
He's doing magic tricks.

5404
03:35:31,450 --> 03:35:33,070
Oh my goodness.

5405
03:35:33,230 --> 03:35:34,350
Back at the wall you go.

5406
03:35:35,050 --> 03:35:35,570
What?

5407
03:35:36,410 --> 03:35:37,390
What the fuck?

5408
03:35:37,390 --> 03:35:38,050
What's wrong with that guy?

5409
03:35:38,230 --> 03:35:39,610
What the fucking bait?

5410
03:35:39,610 --> 03:35:40,410
Are you serious?

5411
03:35:41,070 --> 03:35:42,610
What a fucking bait!

5412
03:35:43,330 --> 03:35:44,990
What a bait!

5413
03:35:46,250 --> 03:35:47,170
What is that background?

5414
03:35:49,090 --> 03:35:50,850
He's a fucking beast, dude.

5415
03:35:50,850 --> 03:35:51,770
Back out if you have to.

5416
03:35:52,810 --> 03:35:53,550
That's our coach!

5417
03:35:54,530 --> 03:35:55,930
Good fucking shit, dude.

5418
03:35:57,050 --> 03:35:58,210
I'm just running it back.

5419
03:35:58,330 --> 03:36:00,390
He's backing out to switch stages each time.

5420
03:36:00,630 --> 03:36:01,930
But I mean, I'm cool with it.

5421
03:36:02,890 --> 03:36:04,570
Let's just make sure he doesn't pick.

5422
03:36:04,790 --> 03:36:05,770
Make sure he doesn't pick.

5423
03:36:05,850 --> 03:36:06,570
It has to say random.

5424
03:36:07,490 --> 03:36:08,390
You did it before.

5425
03:36:08,650 --> 03:36:10,890
You can do it again.

5426
03:36:11,050 --> 03:36:12,390
If it doesn't say random, call him out.

5427
03:36:12,450 --> 03:36:12,830
Disqualified.

5428
03:36:13,090 --> 03:36:14,750
You know you can fucking do it, man.

5429
03:36:17,130 --> 03:36:19,070
Get ready for the next battle.

5430
03:36:20,990 --> 03:36:21,770
Let's get it.

5431
03:36:21,970 --> 03:36:22,830
I love you.

5432
03:36:22,850 --> 03:36:23,230
You got this.

5433
03:36:24,710 --> 03:36:25,830
Round one.

5434
03:36:26,790 --> 03:36:27,350
Fight!

5435
03:36:33,740 --> 03:36:34,620
Oh my god.

5436
03:36:34,620 --> 03:36:35,480
He swapped costumes.

5437
03:36:35,540 --> 03:36:36,160
He's serious.

5438
03:36:40,340 --> 03:36:41,740
Oh, he brought a gun?

5439
03:36:42,280 --> 03:36:43,900
Oh, he

5440
03:36:47,180 --> 03:36:47,180
brought a gun?

5441
03:36:47,180 --> 03:36:47,660
Nice.

5442
03:36:47,880 --> 03:36:48,600
So smooth.

5443
03:36:49,040 --> 03:36:49,600
Nice.

5444
03:36:52,100 --> 03:36:53,060
You're faster!

5445
03:36:53,420 --> 03:36:53,560
Jesus.

5446
03:37:01,460 --> 03:37:02,660
Let's go, dude.

5447
03:37:02,900 --> 03:37:03,420
Yes!

5448
03:37:04,340 --> 03:37:05,320
Go, coach!

5449
03:37:06,140 --> 03:37:06,620
Pressure!

5450
03:37:07,600 --> 03:37:08,460
Fuck him up!

5451
03:37:11,640 --> 03:37:12,420
You're better.

5452
03:37:12,900 --> 03:37:13,680
Straight up better.

5453
03:37:16,320 --> 03:37:17,480
You're a fucking better player.

5454
03:37:18,360 --> 03:37:19,280
He's scared of you.

5455
03:37:19,420 --> 03:37:20,560
He is scared shitless.

5456
03:37:21,220 --> 03:37:22,080
Make him depressed!

5457
03:37:22,980 --> 03:37:24,000
And who wouldn't be?

5458
03:37:24,200 --> 03:37:25,100
Who wouldn't be scared?

5459
03:37:25,280 --> 03:37:25,940
I'd be pretty scared.

5460
03:37:26,020 --> 03:37:26,580
I'd be so scared.

5461
03:37:31,380 --> 03:37:32,600
Smoke and mirrors, baby.

5462
03:37:32,900 --> 03:37:33,460
Let's go.

5463
03:37:33,720 --> 03:37:34,680
Smoke and mirrors.

5464
03:37:34,860 --> 03:37:35,780
That's all it is, dude.

5465
03:37:36,240 --> 03:37:38,240
Let's close it out.

5466
03:37:38,340 --> 03:37:38,860
Be solid.

5467
03:37:38,940 --> 03:37:39,700
You fucking got it.

5468
03:37:39,740 --> 03:37:40,900
Solid play.

5469
03:37:40,940 --> 03:37:41,760
You gotta bounce here.

5470
03:37:42,680 --> 03:37:43,640
Round three.

5471
03:37:44,740 --> 03:37:45,220
Fight.

5472
03:37:45,800 --> 03:37:46,280
Go!

5473
03:37:46,660 --> 03:37:47,520
That bounce!

5474
03:37:50,680 --> 03:37:51,840
That's the stage you wanted.

5475
03:37:51,960 --> 03:37:52,920
You wanted to switch stages.

5476
03:37:53,160 --> 03:37:54,740
You asked for this!

5477
03:37:54,820 --> 03:37:56,420
You wanted this!

5478
03:37:58,580 --> 03:37:59,560
Oh, shit.

5479
03:37:59,740 --> 03:38:00,700
We might have smoked too soon.

5480
03:38:02,380 --> 03:38:03,520
Stop kicking!

5481
03:38:05,300 --> 03:38:06,020
What?

5482
03:38:06,600 --> 03:38:07,220
What?

5483
03:38:07,280 --> 03:38:07,980
Did he dunk it?

5484
03:38:08,040 --> 03:38:11,780
I think he sidesteps.

5485
03:38:12,300 --> 03:38:13,740
Please be wall.

5486
03:38:14,000 --> 03:38:14,980
Oh my god, is it wall?

5487
03:38:15,140 --> 03:38:15,920
Is it wall?

5488
03:38:16,160 --> 03:38:16,880
No.

5489
03:38:30,050 --> 03:38:31,470
Oh my fuck.

5490
03:38:32,450 --> 03:38:33,190
Let's go!

5491
03:38:34,050 --> 03:38:34,870
Let's go!

5492
03:38:34,990 --> 03:38:36,830
You are my yordle!

5493
03:38:37,290 --> 03:38:38,470
He's gone!

5494
03:38:38,470 --> 03:38:39,170
He's gone!

5495
03:38:39,190 --> 03:38:39,730
He's going to Evo!

5496
03:38:39,910 --> 03:38:41,690
He's going to Evo!

5497
03:38:42,730 --> 03:38:43,890
Oh god!

5498
03:38:44,550 --> 03:38:46,770
The good times!

5499
03:38:47,730 --> 03:38:48,970
Oh my god!

5500
03:38:48,990 --> 03:38:49,810
He's strong for me!

5501
03:38:49,930 --> 03:38:50,930
Oh my god!

5502
03:38:51,190 --> 03:38:54,350
You might have a smack, but we have pro-pros!

5503
03:38:54,350 --> 03:38:57,630
Once again, team bro-pro.

5504
03:38:57,630 --> 03:38:57,790
Second gun!

5505
03:38:58,850 --> 03:38:59,830
The whore!

5506
03:39:00,810 --> 03:39:02,110
I fucking love this guy.

5507
03:39:02,810 --> 03:39:04,890
How does he do it every time?

5508
03:39:04,930 --> 03:39:06,570
Every time he does it.

5509
03:39:06,610 --> 03:39:06,850
How?

5510
03:39:07,070 --> 03:39:08,630
How does he do it every time?

5511
03:39:09,490 --> 03:39:10,830
Oh my god!

5512
03:39:11,210 --> 03:39:11,790
I'm suffering.

5513
03:39:12,010 --> 03:39:16,490
I didn't think it was possible for me to have this feeling since last slam.

5514
03:39:16,630 --> 03:39:17,730
It's all over again.

5515
03:39:17,870 --> 03:39:18,930
Team two trips, baby!

5516
03:39:19,130 --> 03:39:19,970
Team two trips!

5517
03:39:22,290 --> 03:39:23,890
You might have E-sum.

5518
03:39:24,490 --> 03:39:25,490
Put us in second.

5519
03:39:25,630 --> 03:39:26,150
I don't fucking care.

5520
03:39:27,610 --> 03:39:31,050
You might have E-sum, but you can't even beat our coach!

5521
03:39:31,510 --> 03:39:32,050
You might have E-sum, but you can't even beat our coach!

5522
03:39:32,050 --> 03:39:33,290
They have to win two sets now.

5523
03:39:33,450 --> 03:39:35,410
If they give it to us, anybody has to win two sets.

5524
03:39:35,490 --> 03:39:36,250
We fucking got it.

5525
03:39:36,250 --> 03:39:36,490
Yeah!

5526
03:39:39,570 --> 03:39:40,950
I do not care.

5527
03:39:41,050 --> 03:39:42,070
Play your losers, come back.

5528
03:39:42,290 --> 03:39:43,270
Who the fuck cares?

5529
03:39:43,350 --> 03:39:44,150
That was Tekken.

5530
03:39:44,870 --> 03:39:46,890
Why do you want to fight me again, Boxbox?

5531
03:39:49,510 --> 03:39:50,330
No, dude.

5532
03:39:50,450 --> 03:39:51,270
I might fight you later.

5533
03:39:51,330 --> 03:39:51,590
I can't.

5534
03:39:53,310 --> 03:39:54,090
He's about to adapt.

5535
03:39:54,470 --> 03:39:54,870
Oh my god.

5536
03:39:55,770 --> 03:39:56,670
What a thrill.

5537
03:39:56,790 --> 03:39:57,170
I'm done.

5538
03:39:57,270 --> 03:39:58,530
He's so fucking good, dude.

5539
03:39:59,490 --> 03:40:00,590
That was insane.

5540
03:40:01,910 --> 03:40:02,830
Good shit, everybody.

5541
03:40:02,830 --> 03:40:04,030
I'm shaking, man.

5542
03:40:04,150 --> 03:40:05,950
Good shit, everybody.

5543
03:40:06,170 --> 03:40:07,250
Everybody here.

5544
03:40:07,370 --> 03:40:07,730
Good shit.

5545
03:40:08,110 --> 03:40:09,190
Oh my god.

5546
03:40:12,630 --> 03:40:13,530
Holy shit.

5547
03:40:13,830 --> 03:40:14,710
Fucking wow.

5548
03:40:15,370 --> 03:40:16,390
I'm sweating.

5549
03:40:16,790 --> 03:40:19,830
I had to close my eyes during some of those moments.

5550
03:40:19,990 --> 03:40:21,250
That was so fucking scary.

5551
03:40:21,850 --> 03:40:24,030
By definition, too hard to watch.

5552
03:40:24,830 --> 03:40:25,930
It's so tense.

5553
03:40:27,050 --> 03:40:29,350
Now imagine being the one that had to play that.

5554
03:40:30,970 --> 03:40:32,810
Dude, it happened to me.

5555
03:40:32,830 --> 03:40:34,790
And again, we are the GOATS once more.

5556
03:40:34,870 --> 03:40:36,050
We are so fucking awesome.

5557
03:40:37,670 --> 03:40:38,950
BrawlPro, how did you feel?

5558
03:40:39,010 --> 03:40:40,450
How did you feel, BrawlPro?

5559
03:40:40,790 --> 03:40:41,730
What do you mean?

5560
03:40:41,910 --> 03:40:43,210
It feels good.

5561
03:40:43,690 --> 03:40:45,530
What do you mean?

5562
03:40:46,710 --> 03:40:48,430
I'm shaking the whole time.

5563
03:40:48,470 --> 03:40:50,450
I'm having like a seizure the whole time.

5564
03:40:51,250 --> 03:40:52,570
You're fucking different, bro.

5565
03:40:52,690 --> 03:40:53,310
You're different.

5566
03:40:53,470 --> 03:40:53,890
You're different.

5567
03:40:54,050 --> 03:40:54,530
Seriously.

5568
03:40:54,790 --> 03:40:56,430
He was so scared at the end.

5569
03:40:56,450 --> 03:40:57,690
You had him backing up, dude.

5570
03:40:57,830 --> 03:41:00,690
Yeah, the pressure fucking...

5571
03:41:00,690 --> 03:41:02,190
You changed the tide.

5572
03:41:02,330 --> 03:41:02,810
You really did.

5573
03:41:02,830 --> 03:41:03,850
You could see it.

5574
03:41:03,950 --> 03:41:04,790
You saw it in the game.

5575
03:41:04,890 --> 03:41:06,210
He was just anxious.

5576
03:41:06,330 --> 03:41:08,830
The Coliseum, it felt like it was the opposite.

5577
03:41:09,030 --> 03:41:09,690
It was the opposite.

5578
03:41:10,110 --> 03:41:11,690
He should not have changed.

5579
03:41:12,370 --> 03:41:14,010
You could tell the momentum shifted.

5580
03:41:16,010 --> 03:41:16,790
Oh my god.

5581
03:41:16,830 --> 03:41:18,690
Look at this tweet somebody made.

5582
03:41:18,690 --> 03:41:19,130
I don't know what happened anymore.

5583
03:41:19,550 --> 03:41:20,970
I seriously don't fucking care.

5584
03:41:22,730 --> 03:41:23,910
What a clutch, man.

5585
03:41:25,310 --> 03:41:25,930
Oh, hold on.

5586
03:41:26,190 --> 03:41:29,130
Bro, we gotta tweet to retweet.

5587
03:41:29,190 --> 03:41:29,570
Hold on.

5588
03:41:29,570 --> 03:41:30,990
I gotta retweet this.

5589
03:41:31,010 --> 03:41:32,430
I gotta farm my content recall.

5590
03:41:32,690 --> 03:41:35,490
Mr. Two Trips.

5591
03:41:37,150 --> 03:41:39,090
Mr. Two Trips.

5592
03:41:39,310 --> 03:41:42,290
Mr. Two Trips.

5593
03:41:42,290 --> 03:41:42,650
Mr. Two Trips.

5594
03:41:42,650 --> 03:41:44,770
I go to Evo two times.

5595
03:41:49,190 --> 03:41:50,910
Send me again, man.

5596
03:41:53,210 --> 03:41:54,170
Two Spirit Plays.

5597
03:41:54,710 --> 03:41:55,550
Yeah.

5598
03:41:55,550 --> 03:41:56,730
Two Spirit Plays.

5599
03:41:56,730 --> 03:41:58,150
I want the big seat on the plane.

5600
03:41:58,850 --> 03:42:00,650
I wanna ride with the pilot.

5601
03:42:00,810 --> 03:42:01,830
Put me in the cockpit, bro.

5602
03:42:03,870 --> 03:42:04,810
Give me the wings.

5603
03:42:07,450 --> 03:42:09,010
We did it for Doki Bird.

5604
03:42:09,270 --> 03:42:09,670
Yeah.

5605
03:42:10,810 --> 03:42:12,030
Oh my god.

5606
03:42:12,530 --> 03:42:14,050
We did it for Doki.

5607
03:42:14,170 --> 03:42:16,350
We are all getting dinner.

5608
03:42:16,510 --> 03:42:17,830
Imagine Super how he's feeling right now.

5609
03:42:20,910 --> 03:42:21,790
But it didn't matter.

5610
03:42:21,790 --> 03:42:22,270
He's done with you.

5611
03:42:22,270 --> 03:42:25,670
He does get to come to dinner because it didn't matter.

5612
03:42:25,750 --> 03:42:26,410
We got to two anyway.

5613
03:42:26,690 --> 03:42:30,050
My rule was if he didn't, then he's uninvited.

5614
03:42:30,290 --> 03:42:30,310
Wait.

5615
03:42:30,310 --> 03:42:32,090
With me, you guys got a better record.

5616
03:42:32,170 --> 03:42:34,110
Because you have to go to loser bracket because last time.

5617
03:42:34,270 --> 03:42:36,210
But we're straight up into the winner bracket.

5618
03:42:36,390 --> 03:42:36,450
Yeah, we're better.

5619
03:42:36,590 --> 03:42:37,030
Yeah.

5620
03:42:38,990 --> 03:42:40,410
We have first or second guarantee.

5621
03:42:40,770 --> 03:42:42,830
We literally brain off.

5622
03:42:42,950 --> 03:42:43,650
I'm playing Pikmin.

5623
03:42:43,670 --> 03:42:43,850
Bye.

5624
03:42:45,970 --> 03:42:46,710
Pikmin time.

5625
03:42:49,250 --> 03:42:50,310
I've been playing four.

5626
03:42:50,310 --> 03:42:51,470
That game is so good.

5627
03:42:51,850 --> 03:42:52,810
It's very good.

5628
03:42:55,610 --> 03:42:58,250
That was my second favorite game of last year.

5629
03:42:58,370 --> 03:42:59,390
That game is so fucking good.

5630
03:42:59,390 --> 03:43:01,390
Out of all the Pikmins, which one did you like the most?

5631
03:43:03,490 --> 03:43:05,010
I like one I think.

5632
03:43:05,090 --> 03:43:05,650
One or four.

5633
03:43:05,890 --> 03:43:07,170
Because one is super...

5634
03:43:07,170 --> 03:43:09,050
I didn't like two because I didn't like the cave system.

5635
03:43:09,390 --> 03:43:12,310
Wasn't two the one with the water enemy thing?

5636
03:43:13,130 --> 03:43:13,710
Yeah, that's the one.

5637
03:43:14,910 --> 03:43:15,590
That's the one.

5638
03:43:16,070 --> 03:43:18,230
What are you playing for right now?

5639
03:43:18,810 --> 03:43:19,210
Yeah.

5640
03:43:20,310 --> 03:43:22,010
I was like, hmmm, should I play all of them?

5641
03:43:22,090 --> 03:43:23,210
Because everyone is talking about four.

5642
03:43:23,370 --> 03:43:26,110
And I tried one and the age got to me.

5643
03:43:26,270 --> 03:43:27,630
So I was like, fuck it, I'm just going to try four.

5644
03:43:28,030 --> 03:43:34,930
But once I played a modern version of Pikmin that was made for modern audiences, I fell in love.

5645
03:43:35,030 --> 03:43:37,050
I'm like, this is highly fucking good.

5646
03:43:37,290 --> 03:43:39,150
It might be my favorite game franchise.

5647
03:43:39,450 --> 03:43:40,870
It's so goddamn good, dude.

5648
03:43:41,130 --> 03:43:42,270
Yeah, I became a Pikmin fan.

5649
03:43:42,670 --> 03:43:47,090
And I am a fan of you because you fucking are crazy today, dude.

5650
03:43:47,650 --> 03:43:49,290
Holy shit, you are nasty.

5651
03:43:49,590 --> 03:43:50,290
I just want to say that.

5652
03:43:50,310 --> 03:43:52,390
You are impossible because you won, dude.

5653
03:43:52,570 --> 03:43:54,550
That's the only way this was possible, dude.

5654
03:43:54,890 --> 03:43:58,450
And I didn't mash while standing for one time, bro.

5655
03:43:58,590 --> 03:43:59,930
I didn't even do the right thing.

5656
03:44:00,130 --> 03:44:03,550
You had to adapt to a guy who beat you twice and you did.

5657
03:44:03,790 --> 03:44:04,710
Yeah, you did it.

5658
03:44:06,030 --> 03:44:06,910
Shit was stressful.

5659
03:44:07,070 --> 03:44:08,730
I didn't want to be the reason we didn't make it, bro.

5660
03:44:08,810 --> 03:44:09,450
I was just anxious.

5661
03:44:10,650 --> 03:44:12,310
We're all the reason we made it.

5662
03:44:12,310 --> 03:44:15,250
Without all of us, we would not have had that buy.

5663
03:44:15,510 --> 03:44:16,430
We wouldn't have had the buy.

5664
03:44:16,430 --> 03:44:17,410
We would have had this game.

5665
03:44:17,970 --> 03:44:19,290
We all deserve it.

5666
03:44:20,290 --> 03:44:21,470
Good shit, everybody.

5667
03:44:21,870 --> 03:44:22,610
Oh my god.

5668
03:44:23,450 --> 03:44:24,370
I like this coffee.

5669
03:44:24,470 --> 03:44:25,630
I'm so proud of you guys, man.

5670
03:44:25,730 --> 03:44:26,070
Seriously.

5671
03:44:26,650 --> 03:44:28,030
I'm so glad we're back, dude.

5672
03:44:28,690 --> 03:44:30,930
Could you imagine the timeline when we were on different teams?

5673
03:44:31,050 --> 03:44:31,610
I wouldn't have cared.

5674
03:44:32,550 --> 03:44:34,250
It would not have been the same vibes.

5675
03:44:34,430 --> 03:44:36,390
I told you guys this.

5676
03:44:36,610 --> 03:44:39,110
When I entered this one, they said we probably wouldn't be together.

5677
03:44:39,330 --> 03:44:40,630
And I was like, alright, I'm not really going to try.

5678
03:44:40,870 --> 03:44:42,810
But, dude, I fucking cared.

5679
03:44:42,810 --> 03:44:45,130
I'm 100% the same.

5680
03:44:45,230 --> 03:44:49,870
If I had any different teammates, like a different team, I would have been like, yeah, okay, Tekken.

5681
03:44:49,870 --> 03:44:51,010
I'll try, but who cares?

5682
03:44:51,290 --> 03:44:52,570
But now it's not the same.

5683
03:44:52,570 --> 03:44:54,010
And it really meant something.

5684
03:44:54,210 --> 03:44:56,150
And now Doki is here to fucking experience it.

5685
03:44:56,490 --> 03:44:58,470
Honestly, yeah.

5686
03:44:58,630 --> 03:45:01,190
I think if I was in any other team, I wouldn't be as hyped.

5687
03:45:02,290 --> 03:45:03,430
Doki, you fit right in.

5688
03:45:06,050 --> 03:45:06,850
Seriously, unironically.

5689
03:45:06,950 --> 03:45:08,950
We could have gotten somebody that didn't vibe.

5690
03:45:09,250 --> 03:45:10,410
You're in the family.

5691
03:45:10,930 --> 03:45:11,670
You're in the family.

5692
03:45:12,810 --> 03:45:13,390
Oh my god.

5693
03:45:14,010 --> 03:45:14,930
I'm in the family.

5694
03:45:15,130 --> 03:45:19,190
The vibes fucking are insane.

5695
03:45:19,330 --> 03:45:19,570
Honestly, yeah.

5696
03:45:19,570 --> 03:45:21,790
All the fans are like, oh my god, team Brawl pros.

5697
03:45:22,150 --> 03:45:24,670
I love watching the content, the comms and everything.

5698
03:45:25,930 --> 03:45:27,010
Yeah, because we're just gamers.

5699
03:45:27,230 --> 03:45:28,370
Yeah, we're just vibing.

5700
03:45:28,470 --> 03:45:29,790
At the end of the day, we're just gamers.

5701
03:45:32,110 --> 03:45:35,450
All these other teams are like sweating and analyzing and trying hard.

5702
03:45:35,570 --> 03:45:36,110
Bro, it's vibes.

5703
03:45:36,810 --> 03:45:37,950
It's vibes over here, bro.

5704
03:45:37,950 --> 03:45:38,270
It's vibes over here, bro.

5705
03:45:38,270 --> 03:45:39,670
E-Sam doing his damn thing.

5706
03:45:39,770 --> 03:45:40,250
You know what I'm saying?

5707
03:45:40,430 --> 03:45:40,830
Yeah.

5708
03:45:42,810 --> 03:45:44,330
So last two rounds to a VTuber?

5709
03:45:44,470 --> 03:45:45,490
Like, what the fuck is...

5710
03:45:47,110 --> 03:45:47,730
Unironically true.

5711
03:45:47,910 --> 03:45:48,670
I know you're joking.

5712
03:45:49,370 --> 03:45:51,030
But like, unironically, that's true.

5713
03:45:51,050 --> 03:45:52,970
From a person that has 30 in defense?

5714
03:45:53,130 --> 03:45:53,790
Like, what's wrong?

5715
03:45:55,010 --> 03:45:57,250
I got 58 same Zs.

5716
03:45:57,250 --> 03:45:58,530
Holy fuck, I hate defense.

5717
03:45:59,090 --> 03:46:00,590
We all shared our stats, bro.

5718
03:46:00,690 --> 03:46:01,190
We all shared our stats.

5719
03:46:02,710 --> 03:46:03,970
I'm showing my stream now.

5720
03:46:04,090 --> 03:46:06,010
I got 54 defense.

5721
03:46:07,250 --> 03:46:08,750
I have 54, yeah.

5722
03:46:09,170 --> 03:46:09,610
I have no defense.

5723
03:46:09,610 --> 03:46:10,930
I was like, how do you have 30?

5724
03:46:11,430 --> 03:46:11,830
All offense.

5725
03:46:13,010 --> 03:46:14,230
We all shared our shit.

5726
03:46:14,690 --> 03:46:18,950
I showed my chat mod here like, how did you get to red with 30 defense?

5727
03:46:19,230 --> 03:46:20,970
I'm like, I don't know.

5728
03:46:21,270 --> 03:46:23,170
I'm that fucking... I'm that dude.

5729
03:46:23,310 --> 03:46:24,030
I don't know what to tell you.

5730
03:46:24,030 --> 03:46:25,930
I don't know what to tell you.

5731
03:46:26,030 --> 03:46:27,310
I just got there.

5732
03:46:27,670 --> 03:46:28,250
I punch.

5733
03:46:28,350 --> 03:46:28,950
I kick.

5734
03:46:29,330 --> 03:46:30,190
Yeah, you fight.

5735
03:46:33,670 --> 03:46:35,510
$70 just to not play the game?

5736
03:46:35,630 --> 03:46:36,150
Get out of here.

5737
03:46:36,910 --> 03:46:38,170
That's what I'm saying, man.

5738
03:46:40,010 --> 03:46:41,290
We fighting this motherfucker.

5739
03:46:41,490 --> 03:46:43,310
Take your sensitive ass back to Street Fighter.

5740
03:46:44,050 --> 03:46:46,770
Wow, what a fucking dopamine rush.

5741
03:46:46,850 --> 03:46:47,790
They do damage, bro.

5742
03:46:50,150 --> 03:46:51,190
What's going on?

5743
03:46:51,310 --> 03:46:52,630
Something about like they're fighting on...

5744
03:46:52,630 --> 03:46:53,530
I don't fucking care.

5745
03:46:53,710 --> 03:46:54,510
Yeah, I'm watching CJ.

5746
03:46:54,710 --> 03:46:55,390
Bro, bro, bro.

5747
03:46:55,630 --> 03:46:58,150
Dude, the fact that you keep getting put in these situations...

5748
03:46:59,110 --> 03:47:01,090
He just keeps doing it.

5749
03:47:01,230 --> 03:47:02,410
Literally, it's remarkable.

5750
03:47:02,670 --> 03:47:04,110
Like, you're due for a loss.

5751
03:47:04,290 --> 03:47:04,930
It's unbelievable.

5752
03:47:07,290 --> 03:47:07,690
Crazy.

5753
03:47:07,770 --> 03:47:09,370
And they studied you, too.

5754
03:47:09,610 --> 03:47:11,370
And you still beat their ass.

5755
03:47:11,910 --> 03:47:16,130
I'm gonna enter online tourneys now because that pressure is nothing like this pressure.

5756
03:47:17,830 --> 03:47:18,650
Seriously, man.

5757
03:47:18,890 --> 03:47:20,390
This is the second time you've done it.

5758
03:47:20,430 --> 03:47:21,170
You're getting used to it.

5759
03:47:21,930 --> 03:47:23,490
Yeah, that's like free content now.

5760
03:47:23,570 --> 03:47:24,550
Let me just enter those.

5761
03:47:24,710 --> 03:47:25,250
Win or lose.

5762
03:47:25,370 --> 03:47:26,910
It's nothing like this.

5763
03:47:28,210 --> 03:47:29,370
There's no pressure, bro.

5764
03:47:29,410 --> 03:47:29,890
You got it.

5765
03:47:30,930 --> 03:47:37,510
It's like I don't even think like EVO would be as much pressure because the thing is, with this, there's an expectation to win.

5766
03:47:37,590 --> 03:47:39,070
I don't expect to win EVO, right?

5767
03:47:39,230 --> 03:47:41,430
But like here, we could fucking win.

5768
03:47:41,710 --> 03:47:43,090
That's what we fucking did.

5769
03:47:44,170 --> 03:47:44,610
Well...

5770
03:47:46,150 --> 03:47:51,270
To be fair, first or second, we know the fans will remember us only.

5771
03:47:51,470 --> 03:47:51,650
Yeah, yeah.

5772
03:47:51,750 --> 03:47:53,190
That's the last time.

5773
03:47:53,330 --> 03:47:54,810
The fans will remember us.

5774
03:47:55,090 --> 03:47:56,310
They'll remember us.

5775
03:47:56,390 --> 03:47:57,650
We can rewrite history.

5776
03:48:00,790 --> 03:48:05,090
Alright, don't tell me I gotta fight Amaz though because we won't go second.

5777
03:48:07,870 --> 03:48:10,610
Oh, nice.

5778
03:48:11,470 --> 03:48:11,950
Alright.

5779
03:48:12,750 --> 03:48:14,750
Oh, SK got a round off.

5780
03:48:14,910 --> 03:48:15,390
Logan.

5781
03:48:18,190 --> 03:48:18,890
Oh my god.

5782
03:48:18,910 --> 03:48:19,950
SK got to 10-year-old?

5783
03:48:22,470 --> 03:48:23,150
Alright, fellas.

5784
03:48:23,250 --> 03:48:24,430
I'm gonna def him for a little bit.

5785
03:48:24,570 --> 03:48:25,250
Yeah, yeah.

5786
03:48:25,390 --> 03:48:26,110
Talk your shit.

5787
03:48:37,820 --> 03:48:40,440
I am so sweaty right now.

5788
03:48:41,360 --> 03:48:43,200
The AC is on full blast.

5789
03:48:43,200 --> 03:48:43,940
I know, right?

5790
03:48:44,120 --> 03:48:45,440
My temperature increased.

5791
03:48:46,460 --> 03:48:46,780
Yeah.

5792
03:48:47,000 --> 03:48:47,720
I feel it.

5793
03:48:47,740 --> 03:48:48,380
My bloodstream.

5794
03:48:49,400 --> 03:48:50,700
I gotta go turn that up.

5795
03:48:50,880 --> 03:48:52,020
Make the temperature lower.

5796
03:48:52,320 --> 03:48:52,920
Holy shit.

5797
03:48:54,760 --> 03:48:57,680
I could feel the sweat coming from both coaches.

5798
03:48:57,920 --> 03:48:58,160
Yeah.

5799
03:48:58,420 --> 03:48:59,780
You know Oli, right?

5800
03:49:00,640 --> 03:49:01,760
He came in my chat.

5801
03:49:01,820 --> 03:49:04,760
He was like, I just asked him, hey, are you going to EVO?

5802
03:49:04,780 --> 03:49:06,020
Because I know he snipes you all the time.

5803
03:49:06,140 --> 03:49:07,380
You guys are like buddy, buddy, whatever.

5804
03:49:07,480 --> 03:49:08,640
Fuck, I don't really know lore, but whatever.

5805
03:49:08,960 --> 03:49:11,020
And obviously, I already have a ticket.

5806
03:49:11,520 --> 03:49:13,180
So I said, hey, you're going to EVO?

5807
03:49:13,200 --> 03:49:13,600
He said no.

5808
03:49:13,720 --> 03:49:17,360
So I said, hey, if we win, or get top two, I give you mine.

5809
03:49:18,280 --> 03:49:19,860
You're gonna see he's going to EVO.

5810
03:49:21,240 --> 03:49:23,280
If his parents let him, he's 19.

5811
03:49:24,620 --> 03:49:29,480
Alright, well, that's also, I mean, like, I was not told this information.

5812
03:49:31,640 --> 03:49:34,680
Dude, he's in, well, I mean, Chicago's a big place.

5813
03:49:34,740 --> 03:49:35,400
He's in Chicago.

5814
03:49:35,440 --> 03:49:38,040
He can't go to Combo Breaker because his parents.

5815
03:49:38,320 --> 03:49:39,540
So I don't fucking know.

5816
03:49:39,640 --> 03:49:40,860
I don't know the lore.

5817
03:49:40,860 --> 03:49:42,160
Maybe they've talked it out.

5818
03:49:42,260 --> 03:49:42,700
I don't know.

5819
03:49:42,920 --> 03:49:47,180
If he's allowed to, I'll, I mean, I'll, you know, I'll give him my ticket.

5820
03:49:47,320 --> 03:49:51,140
If Sajam allows it, of course, you know, there's, there's quote unquote...

5821
03:49:51,140 --> 03:49:52,160
We'll demand for it.

5822
03:49:52,660 --> 03:49:53,600
We'll fight for you.

5823
03:49:53,660 --> 03:49:57,520
I do want to, I want to send, I want to send him to EVO.

5824
03:49:57,540 --> 03:49:57,920
Fuck it.

5825
03:49:57,940 --> 03:49:59,180
Because what else am I going to do with my ticket?

5826
03:50:03,640 --> 03:50:04,360
Holy shit.

5827
03:50:04,420 --> 03:50:06,360
This tournament has been so fucking hype, though.

5828
03:50:06,600 --> 03:50:07,460
Oh my god.

5829
03:50:07,920 --> 03:50:09,800
I swear, I've never been this nervous before.

5830
03:50:09,880 --> 03:50:12,300
And I'm not even playing some of these games.

5831
03:50:14,400 --> 03:50:15,320
It's like crazy.

5832
03:50:19,240 --> 03:50:21,060
It's actually crazy, though, guys.

5833
03:50:21,140 --> 03:50:22,240
I can't believe it.

5834
03:50:22,300 --> 03:50:23,480
We made it to the finals.

5835
03:50:23,840 --> 03:50:24,760
That's fucking nice.

5836
03:50:26,400 --> 03:50:29,920
We made it to the fucking finals, guys.

5837
03:50:33,880 --> 03:50:34,560
That's insane.

5838
03:50:34,940 --> 03:50:36,480
I did not expect it.

5839
03:50:36,520 --> 03:50:39,800
I felt like I had like the least experience out of everybody here.

5840
03:50:39,800 --> 03:50:42,080
And then I get to be in the finals.

5841
03:50:42,300 --> 03:50:42,680
Yeah!

5842
03:50:43,460 --> 03:50:45,100
I was the moral support.

5843
03:50:47,540 --> 03:50:47,820
Yeah.

5844
03:50:49,660 --> 03:50:50,540
I'm happy.

5845
03:50:50,640 --> 03:50:54,380
I like specifically requested BrawlPro2 to be my coach.

5846
03:50:54,580 --> 03:50:58,380
So I'm really happy that like I decided to play King.

5847
03:50:58,620 --> 03:50:59,960
You know, I don't know.

5848
03:51:00,060 --> 03:51:03,740
I don't even know how we got into me becoming a King player.

5849
03:51:04,180 --> 03:51:05,020
But like...

5850
03:51:06,180 --> 03:51:09,780
The fact that like I... I...

5851
03:51:09,800 --> 03:51:14,620
I just randomly decided King would be my character to play in this tournament.

5852
03:51:15,020 --> 03:51:23,300
And then because of that, I specifically requested BrawlPro for for like my coach because I was like, oh, he's a King player.

5853
03:51:23,560 --> 03:51:24,280
That would make sense.

5854
03:51:24,560 --> 03:51:24,780
Yeah!

5855
03:51:24,900 --> 03:51:25,920
And then it's Destiny!

5856
03:51:26,540 --> 03:51:27,220
It was!

5857
03:51:27,720 --> 03:51:29,040
Wait, so we have a hell of a time to chill now.

5858
03:51:30,220 --> 03:51:30,660
Yeah.

5859
03:51:30,660 --> 03:51:31,100
Yeah.

5860
03:51:31,220 --> 03:51:33,740
They gotta do KFM versus PDX.

5861
03:51:33,820 --> 03:51:35,100
Then whoever wins that fights Tone.

5862
03:51:35,180 --> 03:51:36,120
Then they fight us.

5863
03:51:36,340 --> 03:51:36,940
Yeah, yeah.

5864
03:51:36,980 --> 03:51:38,680
So we have to wait for two games.

5865
03:51:39,800 --> 03:51:40,020
Alright.

5866
03:51:40,140 --> 03:51:41,720
I'm just chilling, hanging out.

5867
03:51:42,100 --> 03:51:43,040
I'm mad chilling.

5868
03:51:43,100 --> 03:51:46,240
I'm gonna watch that Box box match and see how much I smoked him.

5869
03:51:46,440 --> 03:51:47,260
Ego boost myself.

5870
03:51:49,300 --> 03:51:49,740
Yeah.

5871
03:51:49,740 --> 03:51:50,560
I was so scared of him though.

5872
03:51:50,600 --> 03:51:51,600
Like he's so solid now.

5873
03:51:51,640 --> 03:51:52,480
He got so much better.

5874
03:51:52,500 --> 03:51:53,100
Oh my god.

5875
03:51:53,340 --> 03:51:54,260
It's actually crazy.

5876
03:51:54,580 --> 03:51:56,000
Yeah and he requested me too.

5877
03:51:56,080 --> 03:52:00,140
Apparently BrawlPro like requested from me as well because I was fucking around on King.

5878
03:52:05,300 --> 03:52:06,680
And it's just...

5879
03:52:07,540 --> 03:52:08,440
It's just crazy.

5880
03:52:08,720 --> 03:52:10,980
I'm really happy I got this team.

5881
03:52:11,360 --> 03:52:15,460
And happy that... because they were there for the first day jam slam.

5882
03:52:15,640 --> 03:52:16,660
They all got together.

5883
03:52:17,000 --> 03:52:18,680
And I was like the plus one.

5884
03:52:20,280 --> 03:52:23,720
And I'm just really happy to be able to meet these guys.

5885
03:52:24,200 --> 03:52:25,500
It's been such cool vibes!

5886
03:52:26,000 --> 03:52:29,160
I haven't grinded this hard in a game in a long time.

5887
03:52:29,660 --> 03:52:32,940
Like last night I was just playing rank and I was so toxic too.

5888
03:52:35,060 --> 03:52:37,620
Because I was just like, I wanna be in Shinryuu!

5889
03:52:43,700 --> 03:52:50,600
I think the reason why people... even though I'm in red rank and getting sort of demolished.

5890
03:52:50,720 --> 03:52:56,300
Is also because I feel like they actually analyze how I play.

5891
03:52:56,540 --> 03:52:59,520
And then I'm just like... I go rank.

5892
03:52:59,780 --> 03:53:00,860
I do allocate.

5893
03:53:05,020 --> 03:53:07,780
I think that is like my biggest weakness.

5894
03:53:07,920 --> 03:53:08,620
I don't adapt.

5895
03:53:09,680 --> 03:53:12,500
Everybody else is adapting.

5896
03:53:12,740 --> 03:53:14,460
And I'm just like...

5897
03:53:15,400 --> 03:53:16,360
Ali kick.

5898
03:53:19,300 --> 03:53:22,540
Good old... but then what do I do?

5899
03:53:22,880 --> 03:53:27,220
What do I do when they learn the... when they analyze?

5900
03:53:31,460 --> 03:53:32,920
What do I do?

5901
03:53:32,920 --> 03:53:36,020
And that's when I get absolutely demolished.

5902
03:53:36,120 --> 03:53:38,480
I'm actually surprised I still took two rounds off Esam.

5903
03:53:38,800 --> 03:53:40,480
And then he adapted.

5904
03:53:40,640 --> 03:53:41,860
And then I don't adapt.

5905
03:53:42,300 --> 03:53:43,980
I just go unga bunga.

5906
03:53:43,980 --> 03:53:45,260
But what if it works again?

5907
03:53:50,560 --> 03:53:55,960
I was like okay but what if this works again and he doesn't adapt?

5908
03:53:56,400 --> 03:53:57,820
And I was just like oh okay.

5909
03:53:59,300 --> 03:54:02,040
Wow this guy actually knows what he's doing.

5910
03:54:14,680 --> 03:54:21,880
And it worked.

5911
03:54:22,480 --> 03:54:27,080
I don't know.

5912
03:54:28,860 --> 03:54:30,100
Yeah.

5913
03:54:30,120 --> 03:54:31,840
What has happened to your golf?

5914
03:54:31,900 --> 03:54:32,520
Dude.

5915
03:54:32,520 --> 03:54:35,980
It was just... I think like... it says how many hours I have in this game.

5916
03:54:36,260 --> 03:54:38,980
How many... well to be fair, a lot of it is just buffer where we're waiting.

5917
03:54:39,400 --> 03:54:42,480
But it says here how many hours I have, right?

5918
03:54:42,860 --> 03:54:44,520
Yeah, 53 hours.

5919
03:54:44,980 --> 03:54:47,320
In like 53 hours, I...

5920
03:54:48,340 --> 03:54:51,200
I got like... well I wanna say like...

5921
03:54:52,600 --> 03:54:56,540
50... less than 50 hours because we've spent a lot on just waiting.

5922
03:54:57,620 --> 03:55:01,800
So I think like maybe like 50 hours or less to Red Rank.

5923
03:55:01,800 --> 03:55:04,700
I feel like that's really good in general.

5924
03:55:07,700 --> 03:55:10,040
And like for my very first...

5925
03:55:11,320 --> 03:55:13,020
For my very first...

5926
03:55:15,580 --> 03:55:16,180
45?

5927
03:55:16,420 --> 03:55:17,460
Yeah, maybe 45.

5928
03:55:17,700 --> 03:55:22,840
I'd say 45 hours not counting like all the waiting and the practice...

5929
03:55:22,840 --> 03:55:25,040
and just the practice range and the crashes.

5930
03:55:28,320 --> 03:55:30,480
I feel like that's really good for a new player.

5931
03:55:31,100 --> 03:55:33,020
Anyway, that's my ego boost today.

5932
03:55:33,180 --> 03:55:36,550
The fact that I got to this rank with like 50 hours...

5933
03:55:37,040 --> 03:55:39,000
I feel like I improved a lot.

5934
03:55:40,140 --> 03:55:46,440
And like I basically gate kept so many actual fighting game players too.

5935
03:55:46,980 --> 03:55:48,600
Because of the bullshit I do.

5936
03:55:53,400 --> 03:55:58,520
Because I know there's like so many people that are like actual hardcore grind fighting games.

5937
03:55:58,840 --> 03:56:00,460
And like they're like hard-scoring.

5938
03:56:00,460 --> 03:56:02,020
And they're like like stuck in like lower elos.

5939
03:56:02,060 --> 03:56:05,680
Like that fucking King player I bumped into that made it to purple rank.

5940
03:56:05,800 --> 03:56:07,820
And it took him like one and a half months.

5941
03:56:07,960 --> 03:56:08,880
And I'm like that's sad.

5942
03:56:09,240 --> 03:56:10,440
I'm sorry if you guys...

5943
03:56:10,440 --> 03:56:11,700
I'm not talking about you guys chat.

5944
03:56:11,960 --> 03:56:13,220
Of course it's not you guys.

5945
03:56:13,280 --> 03:56:15,280
But the ones that had like TTB in their names.

5946
03:56:15,440 --> 03:56:17,280
And they have the streaming tag.

5947
03:56:17,580 --> 03:56:19,320
And then I like looked at their stream.

5948
03:56:19,520 --> 03:56:21,420
And I just see like just made it to purple rank.

5949
03:56:21,640 --> 03:56:24,080
And I like looked at a one and a half months ago.

5950
03:56:24,180 --> 03:56:26,960
They were hard stuck red for one and a half months.

5951
03:56:27,140 --> 03:56:28,580
And I'm like that's so sad.

5952
03:56:28,800 --> 03:56:30,440
I'm literally like two ranks away from that.

5953
03:56:30,440 --> 03:56:30,800
From purple.

5954
03:56:36,440 --> 03:56:37,780
But not you guys.

5955
03:56:37,860 --> 03:56:39,000
I'm not talking about you guys.

5956
03:56:39,060 --> 03:56:41,660
I'm talking about one random purple king I saw.

5957
03:56:42,400 --> 03:56:42,880
Yesterday.

5958
03:56:45,600 --> 03:56:47,800
They're just like me.

5959
03:56:56,060 --> 03:56:57,480
But I'm so happy.

5960
03:56:57,700 --> 03:56:59,380
We made it to the grand finals.

5961
03:56:59,380 --> 03:57:00,440
We're currently waiting.

5962
03:57:00,880 --> 03:57:02,560
Let me put the text out.

5963
03:57:02,720 --> 03:57:03,840
I'll put a text out.

5964
03:57:03,920 --> 03:57:04,820
So people would know.

5965
03:57:05,000 --> 03:57:06,020
We are...

5966
03:57:06,020 --> 03:57:07,620
We made it to finals.

5967
03:57:08,700 --> 03:57:10,180
Waiting for our game.

5968
03:57:12,720 --> 03:57:13,800
Right now.

5969
03:57:14,960 --> 03:57:15,500
Okay.

5970
03:57:15,540 --> 03:57:16,800
I'll put that text up.

5971
03:57:16,860 --> 03:57:17,680
So people will know.

5972
03:57:18,420 --> 03:57:18,960
Yeah.

5973
03:57:21,560 --> 03:57:23,380
So people will know we're just waiting.

5974
03:57:24,920 --> 03:57:26,420
We made it to finals.

5975
03:57:27,860 --> 03:57:29,360
The grand finals.

5976
03:57:29,380 --> 03:57:29,800
Okay.

5977
03:57:30,120 --> 03:57:30,280
Yeah.

5978
03:57:30,340 --> 03:57:30,660
You're right.

5979
03:57:30,720 --> 03:57:31,380
Grand finals.

5980
03:57:31,420 --> 03:57:33,260
We made it to grand...

5981
03:57:34,940 --> 03:57:35,380
Finals.

5982
03:57:37,780 --> 03:57:38,580
There you go.

5983
03:57:38,680 --> 03:57:39,760
So people will know.

5984
03:57:41,300 --> 03:57:42,980
So people will know...

5985
03:57:42,980 --> 03:57:44,120
I should put it in the middle.

5986
03:57:44,140 --> 03:57:44,940
That makes more sense.

5987
03:57:45,380 --> 03:57:45,820
Actually.

5988
03:57:47,080 --> 03:57:47,520
Boom.

5989
03:57:48,800 --> 03:57:49,240
Wait.

5990
03:57:49,340 --> 03:57:51,380
Let me format it better too.

5991
03:57:52,520 --> 03:57:52,960
Yeah.

5992
03:57:56,860 --> 03:57:57,680
There you go.

5993
03:57:58,540 --> 03:57:58,980
Yay.

5994
03:57:59,100 --> 03:57:59,360
I'm so happy.

5995
03:57:59,360 --> 03:58:00,540
We made it.

5996
03:58:01,120 --> 03:58:03,440
I will be your new fighting game Oshii.

5997
03:58:03,780 --> 03:58:05,940
As I never touch Tekken after this.

5998
03:58:10,780 --> 03:58:11,620
I don't know.

5999
03:58:11,660 --> 03:58:14,900
Maybe I'll touch Tekken until I make it to purple rank.

6000
03:58:15,020 --> 03:58:16,200
Just to flex a little.

6001
03:58:16,300 --> 03:58:17,660
And then never touch it again.

6002
03:58:24,120 --> 03:58:25,440
Make it to purple rank.

6003
03:58:25,520 --> 03:58:26,380
Just to be like...

6004
03:58:26,380 --> 03:58:28,680
It's sad that you guys can't be in this rank.

6005
03:58:30,780 --> 03:58:31,340
No.

6006
03:58:32,600 --> 03:58:33,720
Please continue.

6007
03:58:34,340 --> 03:58:34,840
Okay.

6008
03:58:34,880 --> 03:58:39,260
If Sajam invites me to another Sajam Slam, I'll 100% say yes.

6009
03:58:39,500 --> 03:58:41,320
Or for any fighting game.

6010
03:58:41,560 --> 03:58:46,060
If Sajam invites me to any fighting game Slam, I'll participate.

6011
03:58:46,220 --> 03:58:48,220
I'll say yes 100%.

6012
03:58:54,880 --> 03:58:56,800
Peek purple and then start flexing?

6013
03:58:56,860 --> 03:58:57,220
I should.

6014
03:58:57,420 --> 03:58:58,580
I should just peek purple.

6015
03:58:58,680 --> 03:58:59,300
And be like...

6016
03:58:59,300 --> 03:59:00,620
Imagine not being purple.

6017
03:59:03,840 --> 03:59:05,240
He said it might be...

6018
03:59:05,240 --> 03:59:06,120
Oh, I never played...

6019
03:59:06,120 --> 03:59:08,500
Well, like I said, I never played any fighting game before.

6020
03:59:08,780 --> 03:59:09,540
So like...

6021
03:59:09,540 --> 03:59:10,140
Like...

6022
03:59:10,500 --> 03:59:12,020
I never played Street Fighter before.

6023
03:59:12,060 --> 03:59:13,520
Well, that's a lie.

6024
03:59:13,640 --> 03:59:14,120
I played...

6025
03:59:14,120 --> 03:59:15,720
Like, you know the arcade machines?

6026
03:59:15,920 --> 03:59:16,760
With the Street Fighter?

6027
03:59:17,460 --> 03:59:20,380
With the Street Fighter with Marvel characters?

6028
03:59:20,900 --> 03:59:21,740
I would go...

6029
03:59:21,740 --> 03:59:24,100
I went to the arcade and I just button mashed for that.

6030
03:59:24,460 --> 03:59:25,640
So like that was my...

6031
03:59:25,640 --> 03:59:27,180
But I was like super young too.

6032
03:59:27,180 --> 03:59:30,740
But if Sajam invites me to the Street Fighter...

6033
03:59:30,740 --> 03:59:34,580
The Street Fighter Sajam Slam, I'll say yes.

6034
03:59:34,720 --> 03:59:37,360
I mean, I'll message him and be like, I'm totally down to joining in.

6035
03:59:37,540 --> 03:59:39,080
But please put me in newbies.

6036
03:59:39,920 --> 03:59:42,120
And give me actual newbies.

6037
03:59:44,200 --> 03:59:46,740
I wanna be the next E-Sam.

6038
03:59:50,260 --> 03:59:52,760
Make me the next E-Sam.

6039
03:59:53,360 --> 03:59:55,900
I wanna know what it feels like.

6040
03:59:57,180 --> 03:59:57,500
Hahaha.

6041
04:00:00,700 --> 04:00:01,900
Wishful thinking.

6042
04:00:03,960 --> 04:00:04,560
Hahaha.

6043
04:00:05,780 --> 04:00:06,680
Uh-huh.

6044
04:00:08,120 --> 04:00:08,720
Uh...

6045
04:00:08,720 --> 04:00:10,240
No, I'm still a newbie.

6046
04:00:10,540 --> 04:00:12,760
You can't say that I'm not a newbie anymore.

6047
04:00:12,980 --> 04:00:14,740
I still don't know how to block.

6048
04:00:15,220 --> 04:00:15,820
Haha.

6049
04:00:16,300 --> 04:00:17,660
Wait, that's not fair.

6050
04:00:17,760 --> 04:00:19,320
Connor was supposed to...

6051
04:00:19,320 --> 04:00:27,160
Connor was supposed to be in the Sajam Slam and he was in the last Sajam Slam and he was categorized as a newbie.

6052
04:00:27,160 --> 04:00:27,760
I'm a newbie.

6053
04:00:27,940 --> 04:00:29,000
It's not fair.

6054
04:00:29,060 --> 04:00:30,660
I should be like the next Connor.

6055
04:00:32,120 --> 04:00:35,600
He was categorized as a newbie even though he couldn't commit.

6056
04:00:39,760 --> 04:00:40,780
It's not fair.

6057
04:00:41,080 --> 04:00:45,580
I should be a newbie because my blocking stats are still like the newbie tier.

6058
04:00:45,940 --> 04:00:53,620
My attack might be red, but my block is definitely like beginner or first down or some shit.

6059
04:00:56,020 --> 04:00:59,380
My block is definitely in first down.

6060
04:01:03,380 --> 04:01:03,860
True.

6061
04:01:06,720 --> 04:01:09,980
Yeah, so like... I am a newbie.

6062
04:01:10,560 --> 04:01:12,220
I am a newbie, guys.

6063
04:01:12,580 --> 04:01:13,120
It's not fair.

6064
04:01:14,060 --> 04:01:15,260
Look, it's not fair.

6065
04:01:15,520 --> 04:01:17,140
This is my first fighting game.

6066
04:01:17,240 --> 04:01:19,240
I should still be in like the last seed.

6067
04:01:19,520 --> 04:01:20,640
Or was it first seed?

6068
04:01:20,720 --> 04:01:21,100
What is it called?

6069
04:01:21,180 --> 04:01:21,740
The last seed?

6070
04:01:27,200 --> 04:01:29,940
Yeah, I think I learned really fast.

6071
04:01:30,100 --> 04:01:32,460
I'm really happy that I learned so fucking fast though.

6072
04:01:34,020 --> 04:01:35,720
Who's winning at the moment, guys?

6073
04:01:36,000 --> 04:01:37,560
You guys know who's winning at the moment?

6074
04:01:37,820 --> 04:01:38,880
Oh, Team Phi.

6075
04:01:39,160 --> 04:01:39,800
Team Phi.

6076
04:01:40,680 --> 04:01:42,600
Oh, but then they have like Roy.

6077
04:01:42,740 --> 04:01:44,560
Roy is apparently really good too.

6078
04:01:48,400 --> 04:01:49,880
So... Oh my god.

6079
04:01:49,960 --> 04:01:51,280
It's Dragon Ball.

6080
04:01:52,160 --> 04:01:52,680
Wait.

6081
04:01:52,680 --> 04:01:52,800
Wait.

6082
04:01:52,800 --> 04:01:54,020
Roy is getting his...

6083
04:01:54,440 --> 04:01:54,740
Wait.

6084
04:01:54,780 --> 04:02:01,380
Roy is... Yeah, Roy has to win that because Roy is definitely not... does not belong in that seed.

6085
04:02:04,060 --> 04:02:06,740
Roy definitely doesn't belong in the seed.

6086
04:02:07,000 --> 04:02:08,100
It's okay, guys.

6087
04:02:08,160 --> 04:02:10,440
I will represent the VTubers.

6088
04:02:10,800 --> 04:02:20,320
I will represent the VTubers in the finals.

6089
04:02:24,140 --> 04:02:25,160
It's okay.

6090
04:02:25,280 --> 04:02:25,600
It's okay.

6091
04:02:30,520 --> 04:02:31,700
It's okay.

6092
04:02:32,340 --> 04:02:33,060
It's okay.

6093
04:02:34,260 --> 04:02:34,980
It's okay.

6094
04:02:35,520 --> 04:02:35,600
It's okay.

6095
04:02:36,500 --> 04:02:37,160
It's okay.

6096
04:02:45,880 --> 04:02:46,680
It's okay.

6097
04:02:46,980 --> 04:02:47,800
It's okay.

6098
04:02:48,460 --> 04:02:49,380
It's okay.

6099
04:02:49,660 --> 04:02:50,560
It's okay.

6100
04:02:51,280 --> 04:02:52,220
It's okay.

6101
04:02:52,320 --> 04:02:52,980
It's okay.

6102
04:02:52,980 --> 04:02:53,520
It's okay.

6103
04:02:54,140 --> 04:02:54,700
It's okay.

6104
04:02:54,700 --> 04:02:54,720
It's okay.

6105
04:02:54,720 --> 04:02:54,940
It's okay.

6106
04:02:55,080 --> 04:02:55,760
It's okay.

6107
04:03:01,720 --> 04:03:02,820
I'm so excited.

6108
04:03:03,200 --> 04:03:08,200
Also the rare Zaxxedon because we haven't had a chance to actually talk together for a while guys.

6109
04:03:08,560 --> 04:03:14,520
Because like last week or like this week if you want to say Sunday is the start of the new week or the end of the week.

6110
04:03:15,260 --> 04:03:21,800
It was like my technically it was my chill week where I like basically play Tekken.

6111
04:03:23,240 --> 04:03:27,740
So it's nice to be able to finally like actually talk to you guys and everything.

6112
04:03:28,640 --> 04:03:34,020
But oh my god what an eventful week even though like it was technically chill week.

6113
04:03:34,200 --> 04:03:39,800
Being able to participate in SageM Slam and like having SageM invite me to participate.

6114
04:03:39,880 --> 04:03:42,520
I'm so happy that he invited me to participate.

6115
04:03:42,920 --> 04:03:48,100
Because like I honestly I had no expectations I guess about it.

6116
04:03:48,220 --> 04:03:51,700
Like I was just like oh I'm so bad at fighting.

6117
04:03:51,800 --> 04:03:52,020
I'm so bad at fighting games.

6118
04:03:53,320 --> 04:03:55,680
I'm gonna drag my team down.

6119
04:03:56,120 --> 04:03:57,080
I was so scared.

6120
04:03:57,340 --> 04:04:06,640
Then it like like being in the team got me super motivated to like get better and improve and stuff.

6121
04:04:06,860 --> 04:04:15,760
And being able to just like playing fighting games for real for the first time and actually learning combos was really fun.

6122
04:04:15,880 --> 04:04:16,460
It was really fun.

6123
04:04:16,640 --> 04:04:18,760
I think it wasn't with any other team.

6124
04:04:18,760 --> 04:04:21,900
I wouldn't feel as passionate as I did.

6125
04:04:22,580 --> 04:04:25,080
So I'm just happy I got included.

6126
04:04:29,080 --> 04:04:29,640
Yeah.

6127
04:04:30,180 --> 04:04:30,740
Yeah.

6128
04:04:30,780 --> 04:04:34,780
I think if I wasn't so nervous when I was playing against Goomy I think I could have won that.

6129
04:04:35,000 --> 04:04:36,180
I was so nervous.

6130
04:04:36,540 --> 04:04:38,520
I was cause like I was thinking.

6131
04:04:38,820 --> 04:04:40,620
I need to remember to stop thinking.

6132
04:04:41,180 --> 04:04:42,880
Cause that's what got me here.

6133
04:04:45,520 --> 04:04:48,660
I need to remember to stop thinking.

6134
04:04:50,740 --> 04:04:53,540
Cause I got all the punishes correct.

6135
04:04:53,840 --> 04:04:55,480
I got all the blocks correct.

6136
04:04:55,680 --> 04:04:57,720
But I did nothing afterwards.

6137
04:05:01,460 --> 04:05:04,360
I forgot how to kill afterwards.

6138
04:05:06,900 --> 04:05:09,680
Yeah, Determined Nerds definitely got me in that game.

6139
04:05:09,860 --> 04:05:10,720
But we still clutch.

6140
04:05:10,860 --> 04:05:14,180
Guys, but if I didn't, if I won that game.

6141
04:05:14,580 --> 04:05:16,260
We would not have got.

6142
04:05:16,360 --> 04:05:17,900
We wouldn't have got.

6143
04:05:17,900 --> 04:05:20,680
Our fucking insane coach game though.

6144
04:05:20,900 --> 04:05:22,280
So I'm happy I lost.

6145
04:05:22,540 --> 04:05:25,100
So we got the sickest coach game ever.

6146
04:05:25,320 --> 04:05:27,120
With the fucking wall jump.

6147
04:05:27,180 --> 04:05:28,540
That shit was crazy.

6148
04:05:31,840 --> 04:05:33,140
Oh my god.

6149
04:05:33,180 --> 04:05:34,380
The coach plays though.

6150
04:05:34,500 --> 04:05:36,740
We would have missed out guys.

6151
04:05:37,200 --> 04:05:43,740
We would have 100% missed out on the fucking like jump.

6152
04:05:47,900 --> 04:05:51,720
Bro, the fucking wall jump was actually crazy.

6153
04:05:55,760 --> 04:05:57,240
Oh my god.

6154
04:05:58,860 --> 04:05:59,920
That was fun.

6155
04:06:00,020 --> 04:06:00,620
That was so fun.

6156
04:06:00,860 --> 04:06:01,180
I love.

6157
04:06:01,260 --> 04:06:02,280
I was looking at the.

6158
04:06:03,640 --> 04:06:04,920
I was actually.

6159
04:06:04,980 --> 04:06:06,420
I was looking at the tags.

6160
04:06:07,400 --> 04:06:08,440
The tag.

6161
04:06:08,640 --> 04:06:09,860
The birdseeder tag.

6162
04:06:10,140 --> 04:06:12,740
And I like posted it in our team chat.

6163
04:06:13,000 --> 04:06:14,200
But I love the.

6164
04:06:15,600 --> 04:06:17,300
Doki versus Esam.

6165
04:06:17,300 --> 04:06:18,200
Was closer.

6166
04:06:19,880 --> 04:06:21,700
The tag.

6167
04:06:21,780 --> 04:06:23,220
The tag versus.

6168
04:06:23,600 --> 04:06:27,140
The tag versus Asuka.

6169
04:06:27,460 --> 04:06:29,940
That shit was fucking brutal.

6170
04:06:34,220 --> 04:06:35,940
Oh my god.

6171
04:06:37,760 --> 04:06:39,680
Oh yeah.

6172
04:06:39,960 --> 04:06:40,840
Great time.

6173
04:06:45,440 --> 04:06:46,400
Oh.

6174
04:06:46,500 --> 04:06:46,860
Oh.

6175
04:06:46,860 --> 04:06:47,280
Oh.

6176
04:07:17,300 --> 04:07:18,720
I had so much fun with my team in the end.

6177
04:07:19,540 --> 04:07:20,180
Uh...

6178
04:07:21,320 --> 04:07:21,960
Yeah!

6179
04:07:25,220 --> 04:07:26,840
Bro, it's like the...

6180
04:07:26,840 --> 04:07:28,180
I swear, the...

6181
04:07:28,180 --> 04:07:30,660
The Kony-King mirror...

6182
04:07:30,660 --> 04:07:34,380
was like the slowest King fight I've ever seen.

6183
04:07:34,580 --> 04:07:35,720
It's so...

6184
04:07:36,000 --> 04:07:37,060
It's like actually...

6185
04:07:37,060 --> 04:07:41,380
It's like the two Kings just fucking thinking about what to do.

6186
04:07:41,620 --> 04:07:43,380
It's so slow!

6187
04:07:44,060 --> 04:07:45,140
I was like, please!

6188
04:07:45,140 --> 04:07:46,840
I can't take it!

6189
04:07:47,000 --> 04:07:49,000
I can't take such slow King fights!

6190
04:07:51,120 --> 04:07:52,880
It was so intense!

6191
04:07:53,080 --> 04:07:54,680
It was literally rock, paper, scissors!

6192
04:07:56,520 --> 04:07:58,700
Yeah, I would never be that patient.

6193
04:07:59,000 --> 04:08:01,440
If a King made me wait that long, I...

6194
04:08:01,440 --> 04:08:02,280
I fucking...

6195
04:08:02,280 --> 04:08:03,020
You can have it.

6196
04:08:03,080 --> 04:08:03,760
You deserve it.

6197
04:08:04,000 --> 04:08:04,560
Like...

6198
04:08:05,140 --> 04:08:07,300
You deserve that matchup.

6199
04:08:11,580 --> 04:08:13,580
Yeah, it was a chess match.

6200
04:08:13,780 --> 04:08:14,900
It was, honestly.

6201
04:08:16,020 --> 04:08:16,840
Alright, yeah.

6202
04:08:16,900 --> 04:08:18,200
Roy won their fight.

6203
04:08:18,480 --> 04:08:20,980
I mean, it was obvious that Roy was gonna win that fight.

6204
04:08:21,280 --> 04:08:22,060
Not gonna lie.

6205
04:08:22,380 --> 04:08:23,480
It was so...

6206
04:08:23,480 --> 04:08:24,340
Like...

6207
04:08:24,340 --> 04:08:26,860
Roy is really good at...

6208
04:08:26,860 --> 04:08:28,960
Was that character the main character buff?

6209
04:08:29,560 --> 04:08:31,660
He literally has the main character buff.

6210
04:08:32,540 --> 04:08:34,220
But FD wins this.

6211
04:08:35,220 --> 04:08:35,940
Oh, wait!

6212
04:08:35,940 --> 04:08:37,020
FD might win this.

6213
04:08:37,020 --> 04:08:37,860
So it's Team Phi.

6214
04:08:40,260 --> 04:08:40,800
Uh...

6215
04:08:40,800 --> 04:08:42,880
Jin's buff is real.

6216
04:08:43,080 --> 04:08:45,120
Yeah, but how well are you gonna do against...

6217
04:08:45,120 --> 04:08:45,980
Tone's team?

6218
04:08:46,180 --> 04:08:48,200
I feel like Tone's team is definitely like...

6219
04:08:48,200 --> 04:08:49,360
I think it was like...

6220
04:08:49,360 --> 04:08:52,240
It has to be the major upset because Tone's team is actually...

6221
04:08:52,240 --> 04:08:53,560
It is so fucking good.

6222
04:08:53,920 --> 04:08:55,700
I feel like Tone's team has...

6223
04:08:55,700 --> 04:08:58,140
Like, Tone's team was supposed to be in the flatness.

6224
04:08:58,200 --> 04:08:59,160
Because none of us...

6225
04:08:59,160 --> 04:09:00,360
All of us was like...

6226
04:09:00,360 --> 04:09:00,740
Oh, yeah.

6227
04:09:00,800 --> 04:09:03,800
We're definitely gonna go to loser brackets after winning...

6228
04:09:04,260 --> 04:09:04,800
Winning that.

6229
04:09:05,420 --> 04:09:06,100
We're like...

6230
04:09:06,100 --> 04:09:06,440
Oh, yeah.

6231
04:09:06,480 --> 04:09:08,000
Definitely, we're not gonna win against Tone.

6232
04:09:08,080 --> 04:09:09,520
So the fact that we did...

6233
04:09:09,520 --> 04:09:10,940
Was definitely...

6234
04:09:10,940 --> 04:09:13,200
Has to be a huge upset for Tone.

6235
04:09:13,340 --> 04:09:14,960
I think...

6236
04:09:14,960 --> 04:09:15,100
I think...

6237
04:09:16,000 --> 04:09:18,620
Yeah, I was so surprised.

6238
04:09:21,960 --> 04:09:24,020
Yeah, their team is really fucking good.

6239
04:09:24,240 --> 04:09:25,520
So I feel like...

6240
04:09:25,520 --> 04:09:27,980
Like, Fee versus Tone...

6241
04:09:27,980 --> 04:09:28,560
I don't know.

6242
04:09:28,600 --> 04:09:33,340
Unless they didn't study Fee's team and just heavily studied our team...

6243
04:09:33,340 --> 04:09:36,120
I feel like Tone's team would win.

6244
04:09:38,740 --> 04:09:41,160
Yeah, it had to be a major upset.

6245
04:09:41,240 --> 04:09:42,540
Like, even our team was like...

6246
04:09:42,540 --> 04:09:42,780
Oh, yeah.

6247
04:09:42,820 --> 04:09:43,540
We're not gonna...

6248
04:09:43,860 --> 04:09:44,820
We're not gonna win.

6249
04:09:45,100 --> 04:09:46,800
We're gonna be in loser brackets though.

6250
04:09:48,340 --> 04:09:50,100
Yeah, they were the favorites.

6251
04:09:52,620 --> 04:09:53,580
No, 100%.

6252
04:09:53,580 --> 04:09:57,760
I feel that we're gonna play against ESAM again.

6253
04:09:58,360 --> 04:09:59,580
And ESAM will...

6254
04:10:00,300 --> 04:10:01,260
ESAM will adapt.

6255
04:10:01,760 --> 04:10:02,260
All right.

6256
04:10:02,380 --> 04:10:04,380
You guys wanna play some couple of games while we wait?

6257
04:10:05,080 --> 04:10:06,000
I mean...

6258
04:10:06,000 --> 04:10:07,400
We don't really...

6259
04:10:07,400 --> 04:10:07,640
All right.

6260
04:10:08,240 --> 04:10:10,180
Let's do some games with the goons.

6261
04:10:12,180 --> 04:10:13,300
All right, guys.

6262
04:10:13,400 --> 04:10:14,180
Boot up the Tekken.

6263
04:10:14,180 --> 04:10:16,260
Guys, it's time to boot up some Tekken.

6264
04:10:17,120 --> 04:10:18,200
Create session.

6265
04:10:22,090 --> 04:10:24,730
Beating up goon.

6266
04:10:25,690 --> 04:10:26,670
Oh, wait.

6267
04:10:30,450 --> 04:10:31,890
Okay, wait.

6268
04:10:31,930 --> 04:10:32,550
Maybe not.

6269
04:10:38,490 --> 04:10:39,210
Meaning...

6270
04:10:39,210 --> 04:10:41,150
Beating up people.

6271
04:10:41,510 --> 04:10:42,210
There you go.

6272
04:10:42,450 --> 04:10:43,110
All right.

6273
04:10:43,170 --> 04:10:44,290
Beating up people.

6274
04:10:44,470 --> 04:10:44,910
Okay.

6275
04:10:44,910 --> 04:10:48,010
Connection 3 or better.

6276
04:10:48,530 --> 04:10:49,450
Any.

6277
04:10:50,790 --> 04:10:52,570
We're one and done-ing people, guys.

6278
04:10:53,050 --> 04:10:53,310
All right.

6279
04:10:53,330 --> 04:10:54,070
This is the...

6280
04:10:54,070 --> 04:10:54,710
All right.

6281
04:10:56,970 --> 04:10:58,810
Doing custom...

6282
04:10:58,810 --> 04:11:03,190
Doing customs until...

6283
04:11:03,190 --> 04:11:05,810
Maybe this is funny.

6284
04:11:05,890 --> 04:11:09,210
Doing customs until our game...

6285
04:11:09,490 --> 04:11:10,750
Our final...

6286
04:11:10,750 --> 04:11:12,730
Our grand final starts.

6287
04:11:14,910 --> 04:11:15,450
Okay.

6288
04:11:21,540 --> 04:11:22,440
Let's see.

6289
04:11:23,020 --> 04:11:23,760
Name...

6290
04:11:24,800 --> 04:11:25,540
Uh...

6291
04:11:26,420 --> 04:11:28,340
Beating up people.

6292
04:11:29,540 --> 04:11:32,560
Password will be one, zero, zero, zero.

6293
04:11:33,460 --> 04:11:34,340
Let's see.

6294
04:11:34,460 --> 04:11:34,840
Where's...

6295
04:11:34,840 --> 04:11:36,400
Advanced settings.

6296
04:11:38,780 --> 04:11:39,520
Passcode.

6297
04:11:40,080 --> 04:11:40,820
One.

6298
04:11:41,100 --> 04:11:42,080
There you go.

6299
04:11:42,180 --> 04:11:43,180
Nobody will know.

6300
04:11:43,540 --> 04:11:44,900
How would they know?

6301
04:11:47,760 --> 04:11:48,320
Alright.

6302
04:11:50,440 --> 04:11:51,000
Create.

6303
04:11:53,620 --> 04:11:58,980
Alright, I'm gonna watch- I'm gonna use the bathroom so you guys can like fight each other first.

6304
04:11:59,640 --> 04:12:00,740
I'll be right back.

6305
04:13:03,130 --> 04:13:04,130
Alright, let's go!

6306
04:13:06,110 --> 04:13:07,490
Alright, who's gonna win this?

6307
04:13:08,230 --> 04:13:09,830
The- the king player?

6308
04:13:10,550 --> 04:13:13,110
Or the- the fucking victor crutch?

6309
04:13:16,090 --> 04:13:20,750
Alright, if you don't win this, you better fucking win this with an alley kick or you're not a true king main.

6310
04:13:21,090 --> 04:13:22,870
You better end this with an alley kick.

6311
04:13:23,650 --> 04:13:26,550
Give us- give the people WHAT?!

6312
04:13:27,830 --> 04:13:29,490
Okay, that was sick though.

6313
04:13:30,790 --> 04:13:32,470
That was pretty sick.

6314
04:13:33,490 --> 04:13:35,610
Give the people what they want!

6315
04:13:38,510 --> 04:13:40,810
Where is my alley kick?!

6316
04:13:43,750 --> 04:13:44,790
Entertain us.

6317
04:13:45,690 --> 04:13:47,430
Okay, yeah, that was fucking sick.

6318
04:13:47,490 --> 04:13:48,330
The dunk though?

6319
04:13:50,070 --> 04:13:53,050
The dunk was pretty fucking sick, not gonna lie.

6320
04:13:54,250 --> 04:13:55,930
The dunk was pretty fucking

6321
04:14:01,040 --> 04:14:01,040
sick, not gonna lie.

6322
04:14:01,140 --> 04:14:02,840
The dunk was pretty fucking sick, not gonna lie.

6323
04:14:03,460 --> 04:14:04,060
Oh!

6324
04:14:07,740 --> 04:14:08,580
Okay, go.

6325
04:14:10,820 --> 04:14:12,160
Cass is going crazy?

6326
04:14:12,460 --> 04:14:13,360
Oh no.

6327
04:14:13,640 --> 04:14:17,920
This king- This king might be like me, 30 defense.

6328
04:14:19,340 --> 04:14:20,100
This king might be like me, 30 defense.

6329
04:14:20,100 --> 04:14:24,940
This could be a- This could be a- I should be a 30 defense king!

6330
04:14:29,720 --> 04:14:31,060
Oh, just Team Phi won?

6331
04:14:34,160 --> 04:14:35,000
I'm not surprised.

6332
04:14:37,240 --> 04:14:38,500
Hell yeah, the Alligators.

6333
04:14:39,500 --> 04:14:41,620
They're the 30 defense...

6334
04:14:41,620 --> 04:14:43,440
Oh, Team Phi got eliminated!

6335
04:14:44,160 --> 04:14:44,360
Oh!

6336
04:14:45,660 --> 04:14:48,800
Okay, so Team Phi got eliminated, so it's...

6337
04:14:48,800 --> 04:14:50,480
So I have to fight Logan.

6338
04:14:50,860 --> 04:14:53,060
If Kauai team wins.

6339
04:14:56,540 --> 04:14:57,120
Oh no!

6340
04:14:57,660 --> 04:14:58,260
KFM.

6341
04:14:58,280 --> 04:14:59,020
Sorry, not Phi.

6342
04:14:59,120 --> 04:14:59,740
God damn it!

6343
04:14:59,820 --> 04:15:01,100
I got confused!

6344
04:15:01,620 --> 04:15:04,440
Okay, Phi won, so it's SKC.

6345
04:15:09,490 --> 04:15:12,730
Wait, is Amaz... Amaz is on...

6346
04:15:13,830 --> 04:15:15,370
Which team is Amaz on?

6347
04:15:22,130 --> 04:15:24,070
There's so many names!

6348
04:15:24,230 --> 04:15:25,230
There's so many names!

6349
04:15:30,450 --> 04:15:33,750
Okay, because I know they said they didn't...

6350
04:15:33,750 --> 04:15:34,390
Oh, that's good.

6351
04:15:34,490 --> 04:15:34,890
That's good.

6352
04:15:34,950 --> 04:15:36,590
Because my team didn't want to fight Amaz.

6353
04:15:41,930 --> 04:15:42,730
Alright, nice.

6354
04:15:43,290 --> 04:15:44,910
You didn't even end it with an alley kick.

6355
04:15:45,110 --> 04:15:46,130
You're not a real king player.

6356
04:15:46,830 --> 04:15:47,710
Alright, let me in.

6357
04:15:47,910 --> 04:15:48,530
I'm ready.

6358
04:15:49,330 --> 04:15:50,090
Let me in.

6359
04:15:50,810 --> 04:15:53,290
Somebody let me in, because you leave now.

6360
04:15:54,930 --> 04:15:56,710
Kaz, don't make me kick you out.

6361
04:15:58,570 --> 04:16:00,150
Because I will do it.

6362
04:16:01,110 --> 04:16:02,030
Kaz... Oh wait, no.

6363
04:16:02,050 --> 04:16:02,990
You guys didn't fight me.

6364
04:16:03,250 --> 04:16:03,770
Wait, no.

6365
04:16:03,790 --> 04:16:04,970
I fought you, Kaz.

6366
04:16:05,350 --> 04:16:05,690
Leave!

6367
04:16:05,750 --> 04:16:06,950
I already fought you in members.

6368
04:16:10,770 --> 04:16:12,450
You think I don't remember?

6369
04:16:12,850 --> 04:16:15,570
I already fought you in members... and you lost anyway.

6370
04:16:15,810 --> 04:16:16,850
Losers have to leave.

6371
04:16:17,050 --> 04:16:18,390
If you lose, you leave.

6372
04:16:21,810 --> 04:16:23,150
It's the way of the law.

6373
04:16:23,470 --> 04:16:26,770
It's the way of the Tekken... Tekken lad.

6374
04:16:29,790 --> 04:16:30,230
Bro.

6375
04:16:30,790 --> 04:16:32,530
It's the public humiliation.

6376
04:16:34,030 --> 04:16:36,810
Wait, what did Sejam say about the Tekken?

6377
04:16:38,530 --> 04:16:39,750
Alright, here you go.

6378
04:16:39,770 --> 04:16:40,190
Nothing yet.

6379
04:16:40,670 --> 04:16:43,630
He said... I thought he said that Evo wants to send everyone no matter what.

6380
04:16:44,590 --> 04:16:45,430
Is that what he said?

6381
04:16:45,710 --> 04:16:46,850
Oh my god, it's me!

6382
04:16:47,570 --> 04:16:48,610
With those shoes?

6383
04:16:49,170 --> 04:16:50,670
I was trying to see what Tony was saying about me.

6384
04:16:50,710 --> 04:16:52,530
Who the fuck... what's wrong with you?

6385
04:16:52,890 --> 04:16:54,050
What's wrong with you?

6386
04:16:54,070 --> 04:16:55,490
You're banned from the Doki council.

6387
04:16:56,190 --> 04:16:57,130
So talented.

6388
04:16:57,390 --> 04:16:59,330
You're banned from the Doki council!

6389
04:17:00,190 --> 04:17:01,330
Dokis need to wear shoes!

6390
04:17:05,530 --> 04:17:08,990
Doki Prime declares that all Dokis need to wear shoes!

6391
04:17:09,350 --> 04:17:10,590
What's wrong with you?

6392
04:17:10,990 --> 04:17:16,070
I think he said he might send third placers to Evo.

6393
04:17:16,070 --> 04:17:16,650
What the fuck?

6394
04:17:16,870 --> 04:17:20,050
I said send us next year, but I mean I'm just kidding.

6395
04:17:20,330 --> 04:17:21,410
We're free?!

6396
04:17:21,410 --> 04:17:22,010
Exactly!

6397
04:17:22,750 --> 04:17:26,630
How dare you give this for free and not monetize it!

6398
04:17:27,250 --> 04:17:29,310
What's wrong with you Doki?!

6399
04:17:31,090 --> 04:17:33,190
This is it, you get the alley kick special.

6400
04:17:40,010 --> 04:17:41,530
I can't believe it.

6401
04:17:41,610 --> 04:17:44,230
This is why all the other Dokis don't like you.

6402
04:17:44,510 --> 04:17:45,130
Hell yeah.

6403
04:17:48,090 --> 04:17:49,190
That's fucking right.

6404
04:17:49,470 --> 04:17:50,490
Remember this!

6405
04:17:51,090 --> 04:17:52,090
Remember this!

6406
04:17:53,610 --> 04:17:55,750
That's fucking right and you get alley kicked.

6407
04:17:55,990 --> 04:17:57,190
Oh wait I did that wrong.

6408
04:17:57,370 --> 04:17:58,270
And you get alley kicked.

6409
04:17:59,050 --> 04:17:59,530
Goodbye.

6410
04:18:00,010 --> 04:18:00,670
Wait what?

6411
04:18:02,190 --> 04:18:06,670
Oh, a free registration to anyone who has entered.

6412
04:18:06,990 --> 04:18:08,570
So that's, I mean that's 200 bucks.

6413
04:18:08,770 --> 04:18:11,070
That's still really solid but I was like wait what?

6414
04:18:11,210 --> 04:18:13,270
You just get to go for free no matter what?

6415
04:18:13,450 --> 04:18:14,110
I was confused.

6416
04:18:14,510 --> 04:18:15,690
Okay, that makes more sense.

6417
04:18:16,710 --> 04:18:17,270
Leave.

6418
04:18:17,470 --> 04:18:18,030
Leave.

6419
04:18:18,030 --> 04:18:18,210
Maddie.

6420
04:18:19,170 --> 04:18:21,110
Leave or I kick you.

6421
04:18:21,990 --> 04:18:23,270
Where is he?

6422
04:18:23,590 --> 04:18:25,070
Yeah we have zero wins.

6423
04:18:25,670 --> 04:18:26,970
Fucking good luck man.

6424
04:18:29,570 --> 04:18:32,530
I can't believe Brawl Pro plays like that.

6425
04:18:34,710 --> 04:18:36,770
And then PDX was like he's for real.

6426
04:18:36,950 --> 04:18:37,790
Like what do you mean?

6427
04:18:40,050 --> 04:18:41,030
Plays like what?

6428
04:18:41,370 --> 04:18:42,190
Let me know when.

6429
04:18:42,490 --> 04:18:43,010
Okay.

6430
04:18:43,150 --> 04:18:43,310
When?

6431
04:18:44,030 --> 04:18:46,350
I don't know we should watch the last one.

6432
04:18:46,490 --> 04:18:48,050
Let me know when the last one starts.

6433
04:18:48,150 --> 04:18:52,910
I'll play, I'll fight like three more people and then we're gonna see the final match.

6434
04:18:53,310 --> 04:18:53,530
Yeah.

6435
04:18:53,830 --> 04:18:56,270
I mean I'll still play my heart out but like...

6436
04:18:56,270 --> 04:18:57,330
Wait what?

6437
04:18:58,190 --> 04:19:00,230
I'm ready to play something.

6438
04:19:00,250 --> 04:19:01,230
Alright, King versus King.

6439
04:19:01,270 --> 04:19:01,890
Don't be slow.

6440
04:19:03,490 --> 04:19:05,130
I can't do this no more.

6441
04:19:05,210 --> 04:19:07,990
Alright we... I can't deal with slow King fights.

6442
04:19:08,170 --> 04:19:08,910
I really can't.

6443
04:19:08,950 --> 04:19:10,130
I'm too impatient for that.

6444
04:19:10,330 --> 04:19:11,950
Are you gonna play Thousand Year Door?

6445
04:19:12,670 --> 04:19:13,150
Okay.

6446
04:19:13,850 --> 04:19:14,570
That's in a week.

6447
04:19:14,570 --> 04:19:14,870
Nice.

6448
04:19:15,770 --> 04:19:17,270
Oh I told you that helped.

6449
04:19:17,350 --> 04:19:18,150
Like I had it on my chip.

6450
04:19:18,230 --> 04:19:20,650
Oh wait you actually... Oh my god.

6451
04:19:20,850 --> 04:19:21,450
No please.

6452
04:19:22,010 --> 04:19:22,490
Please.

6453
04:19:22,750 --> 04:19:22,930
Try it.

6454
04:19:23,610 --> 04:19:24,930
Remember we had that conversation.

6455
04:19:26,170 --> 04:19:26,710
Don't block.

6456
04:19:27,890 --> 04:19:28,850
Chat would you watch this?

6457
04:19:28,850 --> 04:19:29,250
No!

6458
04:19:30,790 --> 04:19:32,190
I said don't block.

6459
04:19:32,490 --> 04:19:33,810
What's wrong with you?

6460
04:19:34,350 --> 04:19:34,830
Fight.

6461
04:19:34,970 --> 04:19:35,450
No.

6462
04:19:36,590 --> 04:19:38,330
What's wrong with you?

6463
04:19:39,330 --> 04:19:40,730
Well there's your fucking answer.

6464
04:19:40,730 --> 04:19:41,790
Am I not your Oshii?

6465
04:19:41,950 --> 04:19:42,530
You can play it for yourself.

6466
04:19:42,890 --> 04:19:43,510
That's right.

6467
04:19:43,570 --> 04:19:44,810
This is what you get for blocking.

6468
04:19:45,050 --> 04:19:48,210
Why am I playing a fucking cat and goat and god of destruction dragon off in quick match?

6469
04:19:48,470 --> 04:19:48,950
I can't do that!

6470
04:19:49,170 --> 04:19:50,110
We'll play ranked man.

6471
04:19:51,930 --> 04:19:53,870
Real King players don't block.

6472
04:19:54,130 --> 04:19:55,570
What is wrong with you?

6473
04:19:59,610 --> 04:20:02,170
Where's your fucking 30 defense King?

6474
04:20:03,870 --> 04:20:04,770
Like what?

6475
04:20:07,790 --> 04:20:08,470
What's wrong?

6476
04:20:09,450 --> 04:20:10,250
Banish him!

6477
04:20:10,350 --> 04:20:12,410
Banish him from the King Council as well!

6478
04:20:16,210 --> 04:20:18,870
You block and you're still in Garyu rank?

6479
04:20:19,090 --> 04:20:20,330
Like bro that's embarrassing.

6480
04:20:21,430 --> 04:20:23,930
You should be like higher rank right now.

6481
04:20:24,030 --> 04:20:27,750
How am I higher rank than you when you actually know how to play this character?

6482
04:20:28,330 --> 04:20:30,110
Like that's so embarrassing.

6483
04:20:33,690 --> 04:20:34,810
That's all I'm saying.

6484
04:20:38,810 --> 04:20:39,930
I don't know.

6485
04:20:40,430 --> 04:20:42,730
Is this first day?

6486
04:20:44,910 --> 04:20:47,870
No, this does not seem like a first day King.

6487
04:20:51,870 --> 04:20:54,750
He can defense but no Shinryu?

6488
04:20:54,870 --> 04:20:55,390
Exactly.

6489
04:20:55,890 --> 04:20:57,290
Where the fuck is your Shinryu?

6490
04:21:01,590 --> 04:21:04,390
Alright, leave.

6491
04:21:05,330 --> 04:21:05,970
Leave!

6492
04:21:08,470 --> 04:21:10,990
Alright, so one of you guys has to let me in.

6493
04:21:11,470 --> 04:21:14,010
One of you guys has to let me in.

6494
04:21:14,150 --> 04:21:14,490
Guys!

6495
04:21:15,590 --> 04:21:17,550
What are you guys at?

6496
04:21:18,190 --> 04:21:19,110
Are you watching?

6497
04:21:19,730 --> 04:21:21,070
Oh no, I'm playing Clique match.

6498
04:21:21,210 --> 04:21:21,450
What's happening?

6499
04:21:21,710 --> 04:21:23,250
The tracking is insane.

6500
04:21:24,270 --> 04:21:25,610
Tony's watching I think.

6501
04:21:25,750 --> 04:21:28,010
Sorry, I only played Rink for two days.

6502
04:21:28,050 --> 04:21:29,890
Oh now he's fucking flexing.

6503
04:21:31,810 --> 04:21:34,650
Oh yeah, I played Rink for only one day.

6504
04:21:36,090 --> 04:21:36,950
Never lied.

6505
04:21:40,290 --> 04:21:41,410
I never lied.

6506
04:21:44,930 --> 04:21:47,130
Oh, ESAM versus SK is starting?

6507
04:21:47,570 --> 04:21:49,390
Okay, we'll beat up this bear.

6508
04:21:51,210 --> 04:21:52,210
What the fuck?

6509
04:21:52,270 --> 04:21:53,390
Are you actually new?

6510
04:21:55,390 --> 04:21:56,470
We'll find out.

6511
04:21:57,710 --> 04:21:58,230
Alright.

6512
04:21:58,450 --> 04:21:59,310
We'll find out.

6513
04:21:59,330 --> 04:22:00,470
Oh, he doesn't know how to skip cutscenes.

6514
04:22:00,730 --> 04:22:02,590
Guys, you can tell I fixed my PC.

6515
04:22:04,090 --> 04:22:05,810
So nobody can complain anymore.

6516
04:22:05,810 --> 04:22:08,370
I had to underclock my PC hard.

6517
04:22:15,610 --> 04:22:16,970
I fixed it though.

6518
04:22:23,800 --> 04:22:24,760
The solution?

6519
04:22:25,700 --> 04:22:27,060
That's not fixing.

6520
04:22:27,540 --> 04:22:28,480
It is!

6521
04:22:28,620 --> 04:22:29,720
Nobody noticed!

6522
04:22:30,060 --> 04:22:32,580
People were like, oh my god, she's on her new PC.

6523
04:22:33,000 --> 04:22:34,980
And I was like, yeah.

6524
04:22:34,980 --> 04:22:37,880
But now I had to confess.

6525
04:22:38,320 --> 04:22:39,860
Because like, I can't lie.

6526
04:22:43,360 --> 04:22:45,260
I had to confess to you guys.

6527
04:22:46,380 --> 04:22:49,040
Because I would never lie to you guys about it.

6528
04:22:49,240 --> 04:22:49,760
You know?

6529
04:22:49,960 --> 04:22:50,700
Oh my god!

6530
04:22:50,780 --> 04:22:51,700
What the fuck?

6531
04:22:55,200 --> 04:22:57,140
You guys did not know shit.

6532
04:22:57,420 --> 04:22:58,180
Don't lie.

6533
04:22:58,920 --> 04:23:02,940
You guys did not know that I was using my old PC.

6534
04:23:03,060 --> 04:23:03,860
Because it looked good.

6535
04:23:04,440 --> 04:23:04,960
I was using my old PC.

6536
04:23:07,020 --> 04:23:08,540
It looked so good.

6537
04:23:08,940 --> 04:23:12,740
Okay, somebody has to fucking stop.

6538
04:23:14,920 --> 04:23:15,520
Nope.

6539
04:23:15,580 --> 04:23:17,680
This is why your environment is dying.

6540
04:23:19,820 --> 04:23:20,420
Bro.

6541
04:23:21,640 --> 04:23:22,640
This is why.

6542
04:23:24,780 --> 04:23:26,120
We're hunting you down.

6543
04:23:26,620 --> 04:23:28,140
You have nowhere to live.

6544
04:23:29,660 --> 04:23:30,760
What is he doing?

6545
04:23:35,830 --> 04:23:36,990
I ducked!

6546
04:23:46,480 --> 04:23:47,940
Can't be like Slime.

6547
04:23:48,040 --> 04:23:48,920
He lost every...

6548
04:23:48,920 --> 04:23:49,680
Oh, I shouldn't say that.

6549
04:23:52,760 --> 04:23:53,920
He's a good teammate.

6550
04:23:54,000 --> 04:23:56,340
Because I also lost every game today.

6551
04:24:03,550 --> 04:24:06,150
I also lost every game today.

6552
04:24:07,950 --> 04:24:09,130
I'm no better.

6553
04:24:09,870 --> 04:24:10,990
I'm no better.

6554
04:24:11,650 --> 04:24:13,050
Slime is a great teammate.

6555
04:24:14,030 --> 04:24:14,310
Oh.

6556
04:24:16,370 --> 04:24:17,390
Oh, Slime.

6557
04:24:17,390 --> 04:24:18,090
You get your run back.

6558
04:24:18,730 --> 04:24:19,290
Maybe.

6559
04:24:19,490 --> 04:24:20,550
Now with Johnny.

6560
04:24:20,830 --> 04:24:21,230
Oh.

6561
04:24:23,350 --> 04:24:24,170
Wait, did I?

6562
04:24:25,210 --> 04:24:25,770
Nice.

6563
04:24:26,330 --> 04:24:26,890
No!

6564
04:24:26,990 --> 04:24:27,570
Not nice!

6565
04:24:28,250 --> 04:24:29,110
Not nice!

6566
04:24:29,690 --> 04:24:30,090
No!

6567
04:24:30,690 --> 04:24:31,570
I failed!

6568
04:24:33,130 --> 04:24:34,230
Slime, catch me.

6569
04:24:34,290 --> 04:24:34,910
I'm sorry.

6570
04:24:35,010 --> 04:24:38,850
I got into a headspace that made me just wanted to roast everybody.

6571
04:24:39,070 --> 04:24:39,950
I'm so sorry.

6572
04:24:41,390 --> 04:24:41,950
Whatever.

6573
04:24:42,470 --> 04:24:43,030
Whatever.

6574
04:24:43,030 --> 04:24:44,750
Whenever I'm at a...

6575
04:24:44,750 --> 04:24:48,270
When I play Tekken, it's hard to stop.

6576
04:24:49,170 --> 04:24:50,790
Like, there's nobody safe.

6577
04:24:51,190 --> 04:24:52,870
Nobody safe from me.

6578
04:24:53,930 --> 04:24:54,730
That's why.

6579
04:24:57,610 --> 04:24:58,290
Nice.

6580
04:24:58,290 --> 04:24:58,670
Okay.

6581
04:25:00,770 --> 04:25:02,490
Just nobody is safe.

6582
04:25:02,570 --> 04:25:03,930
Everybody gets hurt.

6583
04:25:09,830 --> 04:25:11,190
Losing to a first...

6584
04:25:11,190 --> 04:25:13,010
You know that guy was not...

6585
04:25:13,010 --> 04:25:14,350
Actually a first on.

6586
04:25:14,450 --> 04:25:15,890
This guy fucking played before.

6587
04:25:16,010 --> 04:25:17,890
This is not their first fighting game.

6588
04:25:20,810 --> 04:25:23,230
This guy was not their first one.

6589
04:25:26,710 --> 04:25:28,750
Learned a combo first before.

6590
04:25:28,910 --> 04:25:31,050
I don't need to learn a combo!

6591
04:25:33,650 --> 04:25:35,850
I can get away with it.

6592
04:25:36,470 --> 04:25:38,090
Until I can't.

6593
04:25:38,630 --> 04:25:39,170
Okay.

6594
04:25:39,190 --> 04:25:42,730
If I don't know combos, it's because my coach didn't coach me hard enough.

6595
04:25:43,570 --> 04:25:44,130
Alright.

6596
04:25:53,840 --> 04:25:54,400
Alright!

6597
04:25:55,340 --> 04:25:55,840
Oh, you're right!

6598
04:25:55,920 --> 04:25:57,200
I know one combo!

6599
04:25:57,480 --> 04:25:59,040
I know one combo!

6600
04:25:59,920 --> 04:26:00,480
Guys...

6601
04:26:01,200 --> 04:26:02,900
That's all I need to do.

6602
04:26:09,740 --> 04:26:11,660
I know one combo.

6603
04:26:11,740 --> 04:26:12,840
That's all I need.

6604
04:26:14,100 --> 04:26:15,560
I just need to know one.

6605
04:26:16,980 --> 04:26:18,100
What the fuck?

6606
04:26:18,360 --> 04:26:20,280
Oh my god, fucking Viktor crutch.

6607
04:26:22,580 --> 04:26:23,720
Using a crutch.

6608
04:26:26,640 --> 04:26:27,820
That's fucking... Wow!

6609
04:26:28,160 --> 04:26:29,080
That's not right!

6610
04:26:30,100 --> 04:26:31,280
What the fuck?

6611
04:26:33,760 --> 04:26:35,060
Okay, this is not fair.

6612
04:26:35,160 --> 04:26:36,180
He's literally blue ring.

6613
04:26:36,540 --> 04:26:37,520
That's not fair.

6614
04:26:37,700 --> 04:26:38,100
Stop!

6615
04:26:38,760 --> 04:26:39,280
Stop!

6616
04:26:41,100 --> 04:26:42,580
I'm just right!

6617
04:26:44,300 --> 04:26:44,820
Bro!

6618
04:26:47,900 --> 04:26:49,320
Get away from me.

6619
04:26:49,620 --> 04:26:51,360
Get away from me.

6620
04:26:52,700 --> 04:26:54,560
Oh, and you just got a roll?

6621
04:26:55,360 --> 04:26:56,520
Fucking bitch.

6622
04:27:01,100 --> 04:27:02,460
Yeah, you're a bitch.

6623
04:27:04,700 --> 04:27:05,600
Fuck you.

6624
04:27:12,700 --> 04:27:13,980
Get out.

6625
04:27:13,980 --> 04:27:14,060
Get out.

6626
04:27:14,800 --> 04:27:16,360
Using a Viktor crutch.

6627
04:27:16,480 --> 04:27:17,280
Get out.

6628
04:27:17,380 --> 04:27:18,220
Get out.

6629
04:27:25,070 --> 04:27:27,510
Oh shit, I need to remember that he does that.

6630
04:27:28,870 --> 04:27:29,790
Oh my god!

6631
04:27:30,470 --> 04:27:32,350
I knew that was an easy low!

6632
04:27:32,750 --> 04:27:33,850
I'm learning.

6633
04:27:34,470 --> 04:27:35,710
I'm learning.

6634
04:27:37,670 --> 04:27:39,930
Oh please, I'm not learning anymore.

6635
04:27:40,250 --> 04:27:41,950
I'm not learning anymore.

6636
04:27:44,190 --> 04:27:45,990
I'm not learning anymore.

6637
04:27:45,990 --> 04:27:47,270
I'm not learning anymore.

6638
04:27:47,270 --> 04:27:47,730
I'm not learning anymore.

6639
04:27:47,730 --> 04:27:49,450
I stopped learning.

6640
04:27:50,070 --> 04:27:58,050
There's like a point where I just suddenly stopped learning because it's like too much, you know like pay a subscription To start learning more guys.

6641
04:27:58,350 --> 04:27:59,890
I used up all my data.

6642
04:28:00,310 --> 04:28:02,270
I use up my subscription data.

6643
04:28:04,710 --> 04:28:08,070
I Used up my subscription data.

6644
04:28:08,310 --> 04:28:14,910
It was like five gigabytes and all that five gigabytes was gone that Let me back in!

6645
04:28:15,010 --> 04:28:16,210
Let me back in!

6646
04:28:19,630 --> 04:28:21,730
The free sample has ended.

6647
04:28:21,930 --> 04:28:25,550
Your free monthly subscription has ended.

6648
04:28:25,690 --> 04:28:26,730
Okay, this is the last one.

6649
04:28:27,990 --> 04:28:31,010
It's very possible that we play Team PDX.

6650
04:28:31,170 --> 04:28:33,070
I mean, SK and ESM are tied.

6651
04:28:33,550 --> 04:28:34,350
They're tied?

6652
04:28:34,610 --> 04:28:35,210
Oh, shit.

6653
04:28:35,230 --> 04:28:36,350
Oh my god, they're tied?

6654
04:28:36,650 --> 04:28:38,590
SK is punishing the slide.

6655
04:28:38,690 --> 04:28:40,130
How did she do it?

6656
04:28:41,530 --> 04:28:44,870
I mean, she's blocking it, then she's doing while standing 4.

6657
04:28:44,870 --> 04:28:45,550
She's blocking?

6658
04:28:51,910 --> 04:28:53,930
Popro, why didn't you teach me that?

6659
04:28:54,590 --> 04:28:55,990
I've literally tried.

6660
04:28:57,170 --> 04:28:59,130
For like 2 days straight.

6661
04:29:00,870 --> 04:29:03,690
This is why my defense is at 30.

6662
04:29:10,430 --> 04:29:11,590
It's a fear.

6663
04:29:11,630 --> 04:29:13,110
How is she blocking?

6664
04:29:13,130 --> 04:29:14,550
Just so we can say we...

6665
04:29:14,870 --> 04:29:15,930
Beat all the other teams, maybe.

6666
04:29:16,210 --> 04:29:16,590
I don't know.

6667
04:29:17,250 --> 04:29:18,610
Oh, that Rage Art is clean.

6668
04:29:23,890 --> 04:29:25,950
Oh, my team is all in ranked.

6669
04:29:26,130 --> 04:29:27,050
Trying to level up.

6670
04:29:27,210 --> 04:29:27,810
Oh, okay.

6671
04:29:28,490 --> 04:29:28,890
Hello.

6672
04:29:29,930 --> 04:29:30,730
I'm chillin'.

6673
04:29:30,730 --> 04:29:31,490
Quick match here.

6674
04:29:31,950 --> 04:29:33,790
I would love to not play Josh again.

6675
04:29:33,990 --> 04:29:34,950
I'll say that much.

6676
04:29:36,430 --> 04:29:39,630
I mean, you'd have to fight freaking Fairlight, dude.

6677
04:29:39,830 --> 04:29:40,190
Good.

6678
04:29:40,290 --> 04:29:40,890
Fuck it.

6679
04:29:40,950 --> 04:29:41,290
Yes.

6680
04:29:41,770 --> 04:29:42,950
I'll play FreakyPingway.

6681
04:29:44,430 --> 04:29:44,830
FreakyPingway?

6682
04:29:44,870 --> 04:29:46,770
If you launch his shoulder, man.

6683
04:29:47,070 --> 04:29:47,790
I mean...

6684
04:29:48,510 --> 04:29:49,390
I can't!

6685
04:29:49,390 --> 04:29:50,590
I'm on the wrong side!

6686
04:29:52,210 --> 04:29:55,670
SK is probably gonna take this, maybe.

6687
04:29:55,830 --> 04:29:56,670
Oh, my God.

6688
04:29:56,810 --> 04:29:58,010
I don't know if you guys are watching this.

6689
04:29:58,070 --> 04:29:59,690
I'm on the wrong side!

6690
04:30:00,010 --> 04:30:01,130
She's doing the matrix and stuff.

6691
04:30:02,970 --> 04:30:03,410
Alright.

6692
04:30:03,410 --> 04:30:03,850
Alright.

6693
04:30:03,910 --> 04:30:04,850
After... Make this quick!

6694
04:30:05,050 --> 04:30:06,750
We need to watch the SK match!

6695
04:30:07,230 --> 04:30:08,110
Make this quick!

6696
04:30:09,830 --> 04:30:10,270
Okay.

6697
04:30:10,290 --> 04:30:11,230
I'm watching in the side.

6698
04:30:11,910 --> 04:30:12,350
Sorry.

6699
04:30:12,470 --> 04:30:13,850
I'm watching this on the side right now.

6700
04:30:13,990 --> 04:30:14,150
Okay.

6701
04:30:14,150 --> 04:30:15,770
If I lose, it's because I wasn't paying attention.

6702
04:30:16,110 --> 04:30:17,230
I need you to know that.

6703
04:30:17,430 --> 04:30:17,710
Okay?

6704
04:30:17,830 --> 04:30:19,010
It's not anything else.

6705
04:30:19,050 --> 04:30:20,090
I was not paying attention.

6706
04:30:21,110 --> 04:30:21,650
Alright.

6707
04:30:26,230 --> 04:30:26,770
Nice.

6708
04:30:28,450 --> 04:30:30,770
Now that's embarrassing for you.

6709
04:30:37,730 --> 04:30:38,810
Oh, please!

6710
04:30:39,310 --> 04:30:40,670
Why aren't you winning?

6711
04:30:42,230 --> 04:30:44,110
This is how I farm the reds.

6712
04:30:47,190 --> 04:30:49,550
You're a good example of how I farm all of you.

6713
04:30:53,910 --> 04:30:55,590
Thank you for demonstrating.

6714
04:30:59,590 --> 04:31:00,270
Oh, shit.

6715
04:31:00,350 --> 04:31:00,670
I'm sorry.

6716
04:31:00,770 --> 04:31:01,430
I did not mean that.

6717
04:31:02,190 --> 04:31:02,590
JK.

6718
04:31:02,930 --> 04:31:03,950
I meant it.

6719
04:31:06,810 --> 04:31:07,210
Yeah!

6720
04:31:11,190 --> 04:31:12,470
I meant it all.

6721
04:31:16,820 --> 04:31:17,320
I just didn't mean it.

6722
04:31:21,640 --> 04:31:22,140
Hurry.

6723
04:31:24,100 --> 04:31:24,720
Oh, shit.

6724
04:31:24,780 --> 04:31:25,300
Don't hurry.

6725
04:31:25,760 --> 04:31:26,260
Wait.

6726
04:31:26,760 --> 04:31:28,000
She didn't hit that.

6727
04:31:30,100 --> 04:31:30,780
Oh, no.

6728
04:31:31,140 --> 04:31:31,900
Oh, no.

6729
04:31:32,600 --> 04:31:35,620
Guys, I'm not paying attention because I have to watch the game.

6730
04:31:36,060 --> 04:31:36,560
Ah!

6731
04:31:38,960 --> 04:31:39,720
There you go.

6732
04:31:40,300 --> 04:31:40,800
Ugh!

6733
04:31:41,300 --> 04:31:41,800
Ugh!

6734
04:31:43,820 --> 04:31:44,780
No, please.

6735
04:31:46,680 --> 04:31:47,980
I'm not paying attention.

6736
04:31:48,720 --> 04:31:52,020
Alright, Jake, I lost on purpose so I can watch the game.

6737
04:31:52,340 --> 04:31:53,680
Wait, SK won?

6738
04:31:55,180 --> 04:31:56,600
Okay, SK just won.

6739
04:31:56,660 --> 04:31:58,260
She just destroyed each team.

6740
04:31:58,320 --> 04:31:58,640
What?

6741
04:31:59,900 --> 04:32:02,540
She freaking destroyed him last round though.

6742
04:32:02,580 --> 04:32:03,000
Last round.

6743
04:32:03,300 --> 04:32:04,320
Oh, it's last round.

6744
04:32:05,740 --> 04:32:08,560
Alright guys, we're leaving to watch now.

6745
04:32:11,890 --> 04:32:13,030
We're gonna watch.

6746
04:32:13,430 --> 04:32:14,850
Where is... okay.

6747
04:32:16,490 --> 04:32:17,370
Let's see.

6748
04:32:22,130 --> 04:32:22,770
Watching...

6749
04:32:25,720 --> 04:32:27,780
To see who we fight.

6750
04:32:36,100 --> 04:32:37,120
In finals.

6751
04:32:37,360 --> 04:32:37,780
Okay.

6752
04:32:38,440 --> 04:32:39,080
Nice.

6753
04:32:39,540 --> 04:32:40,180
Replace.

6754
04:32:40,880 --> 04:32:43,260
Alright, sorry we couldn't play a lot of customs.

6755
04:32:46,660 --> 04:32:48,820
Wait, did SK win for her team?

6756
04:32:48,920 --> 04:32:49,200
Or did SK just...

6757
04:32:49,220 --> 04:32:49,860
Dude, I have to do one more.

6758
04:32:51,600 --> 04:32:52,920
I think she just won.

6759
04:32:53,000 --> 04:32:54,480
She won the first game.

6760
04:32:54,540 --> 04:32:55,260
She beat ESAM.

6761
04:32:57,000 --> 04:32:57,860
What's good fellas?

6762
04:32:57,940 --> 04:32:58,200
We back?

6763
04:32:59,560 --> 04:33:00,860
They're still gaming.

6764
04:33:01,180 --> 04:33:01,860
Yeah, yeah.

6765
04:33:02,760 --> 04:33:04,900
I want Fii to win so bad, bro.

6766
04:33:07,060 --> 04:33:08,920
I definitely could take FD, I think.

6767
04:33:09,220 --> 04:33:09,660
Yeah.

6768
04:33:10,780 --> 04:33:11,220
Okay.

6769
04:33:12,080 --> 04:33:12,960
What was...

6770
04:33:12,960 --> 04:33:15,540
What was SK's weakness?

6771
04:33:21,450 --> 04:33:24,810
Because I had no... I did not realize I was gonna be fighting SK.

6772
04:33:27,970 --> 04:33:29,770
If you have no idea, then you know what?

6773
04:33:29,810 --> 04:33:30,730
Just run your shit.

6774
04:33:30,970 --> 04:33:31,750
Okay, ally kick.

6775
04:33:33,330 --> 04:33:33,730
Maybe.

6776
04:33:35,030 --> 04:33:35,430
Yes.

6777
04:33:37,130 --> 04:33:38,270
Nope, ally kick it is.

6778
04:33:38,710 --> 04:33:39,750
Breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

6779
04:33:40,630 --> 04:33:41,230
Yes, sir.

6780
04:33:41,250 --> 04:33:42,130
Coach, what do I do?

6781
04:33:42,250 --> 04:33:43,890
You never prepared me for SK.

6782
04:33:47,110 --> 04:33:47,510
Um...

6783
04:33:49,170 --> 04:33:49,890
Hold on.

6784
04:33:49,890 --> 04:33:51,490
Let me watch some tapes.

6785
04:33:53,870 --> 04:33:55,570
Wait, Raidus is going crazy.

6786
04:33:56,630 --> 04:33:57,150
Whoa.

6787
04:33:57,150 --> 04:33:57,670
Yeah.

6788
04:34:00,050 --> 04:34:01,330
Does anyone have the...

6789
04:34:03,010 --> 04:34:03,850
Oh, never mind.

6790
04:34:03,890 --> 04:34:04,250
I got it.

6791
04:34:04,270 --> 04:34:05,010
The chart.

6792
04:34:06,450 --> 04:34:09,410
How did we do against Team Fii two days ago?

6793
04:34:09,710 --> 04:34:10,250
4-1.

6794
04:34:10,630 --> 04:34:11,410
4-1.

6795
04:34:11,410 --> 04:34:12,190
It was me.

6796
04:34:13,090 --> 04:34:15,750
So we're way better off against them.

6797
04:34:15,950 --> 04:34:16,370
Yeah.

6798
04:34:17,330 --> 04:34:19,390
Wait, only Doki lost?

6799
04:34:19,630 --> 04:34:19,790
Yeah.

6800
04:34:19,890 --> 04:34:20,950
I lost to SK.

6801
04:34:21,550 --> 04:34:23,590
I got like one round off her.

6802
04:34:24,210 --> 04:34:26,410
I think we 3-2'd a different day.

6803
04:34:26,610 --> 04:34:28,270
Like we 3-2'd and then 4-1'd.

6804
04:34:28,290 --> 04:34:28,870
I see.

6805
04:34:29,790 --> 04:34:30,310
I think.

6806
04:34:36,200 --> 04:34:36,640
Mix.

6807
04:34:37,360 --> 04:34:38,240
No way.

6808
04:34:38,300 --> 04:34:40,140
She went for that giant mid and it worked.

6809
04:34:40,240 --> 04:34:40,700
That's sick.

6810
04:34:42,460 --> 04:34:43,700
She got a round off.

6811
04:34:44,580 --> 04:34:47,200
We went 3-2 day one against them, then 4-1.

6812
04:34:47,300 --> 04:34:47,520
Yeah.

6813
04:34:47,620 --> 04:34:47,920
Yeah.

6814
04:34:48,860 --> 04:34:50,660
I'm way more confident against them.

6815
04:34:50,780 --> 04:34:52,060
I mean, we can beat Tony, obviously.

6816
04:34:52,060 --> 04:34:52,440
But...

6817
04:34:56,240 --> 04:34:57,680
Tony's team is just crap.

6818
04:34:57,680 --> 04:34:59,000
Tony is just stressful.

6819
04:34:59,900 --> 04:35:00,520
I feel like...

6820
04:35:00,520 --> 04:35:01,460
But they do have to win two sets.

6821
04:35:01,760 --> 04:35:02,200
So...

6822
04:35:02,200 --> 04:35:07,260
I think it's because like their team all like analyzed us, but they didn't really analyze each other.

6823
04:35:07,700 --> 04:35:08,260
Sure.

6824
04:35:08,580 --> 04:35:09,760
I feel like...

6825
04:35:09,760 --> 04:35:10,040
It's possible.

6826
04:35:11,940 --> 04:35:15,580
Because I know a lot of them were hard grinding against our characters.

6827
04:35:21,680 --> 04:35:23,900
Wait, why is he D-Packing her?

6828
04:35:24,340 --> 04:35:24,900
Whoa!

6829
04:35:24,900 --> 04:35:25,420
Did he?

6830
04:35:26,200 --> 04:35:26,760
Yeah.

6831
04:35:26,780 --> 04:35:27,620
That's so toxic.

6832
04:35:27,620 --> 04:35:28,380
I didn't see it.

6833
04:35:28,400 --> 04:35:29,380
That's fucked up, man.

6834
04:35:29,680 --> 04:35:31,880
Maybe Raze just annoyed that you beat him.

6835
04:35:32,620 --> 04:35:34,660
He's taking out his anger somewhere else.

6836
04:35:35,700 --> 04:35:36,400
That's true.

6837
04:35:36,480 --> 04:35:37,600
He's like, I shouldn't be...

6838
04:35:37,600 --> 04:35:39,140
Dude, I was very disrespectful in my shit.

6839
04:35:39,180 --> 04:35:39,780
I feel bad.

6840
04:35:39,940 --> 04:35:43,420
I was so annoyed after we watched those tapes last night, dude.

6841
04:35:43,560 --> 04:35:43,940
Like...

6842
04:35:44,420 --> 04:35:45,740
I was like, dude, he's doing one thing.

6843
04:35:46,620 --> 04:35:47,060
Yeah.

6844
04:35:47,400 --> 04:35:50,340
You lost to the Heihachi gatekeeper.

6845
04:35:50,740 --> 04:35:51,880
Heihachi gatekeeper?

6846
04:35:52,600 --> 04:35:55,280
I'm about to fight Heihachi and Dragunov walks in front... wait.

6847
04:35:57,420 --> 04:35:58,260
He's a bot?

6848
04:35:58,440 --> 04:36:01,080
Dude, that's mad disrespectful to say about him.

6849
04:36:01,080 --> 04:36:03,980
I know, I know, but I was so fucking mad, dude.

6850
04:36:04,080 --> 04:36:07,520
Oh, man.

6851
04:36:09,880 --> 04:36:11,680
Oh my god, she's kinda...

6852
04:36:11,680 --> 04:36:13,100
She's going crazy.

6853
04:36:13,100 --> 04:36:13,980
She's kinda...

6854
04:36:13,980 --> 04:36:15,280
Oh, she's steady.

6855
04:36:15,600 --> 04:36:16,000
Are we sure we want to beat this team?

6856
04:36:16,020 --> 04:36:16,500
We blocked this.

6857
04:36:16,640 --> 04:36:17,100
We blocked this.

6858
04:36:17,620 --> 04:36:18,080
Okay.

6859
04:36:26,230 --> 04:36:29,270
I'm way more confident against Cat than Reed.

6860
04:36:29,330 --> 04:36:31,310
It's because Cat kind of gets scrambled.

6861
04:36:31,310 --> 04:36:33,010
Scrambled against pressure.

6862
04:36:33,190 --> 04:36:36,130
Yeah, she gets really flustered against a lot of offense.

6863
04:36:37,150 --> 04:36:38,510
Remember the last time you saw her?

6864
04:36:38,510 --> 04:36:39,030
Oh, good break.

6865
04:36:39,250 --> 04:36:40,290
I fucked on her, not gonna lie.

6866
04:36:41,130 --> 04:36:41,570
Wait.

6867
04:36:41,650 --> 04:36:42,190
Oh my god.

6868
04:36:42,250 --> 04:36:43,370
Oh, no way.

6869
04:36:43,370 --> 04:36:43,570
No.

6870
04:36:43,710 --> 04:36:45,350
What if I tackle you back?

6871
04:36:45,930 --> 04:36:46,650
That's crazy.

6872
04:36:49,470 --> 04:36:49,910
Sheesh.

6873
04:37:01,070 --> 04:37:02,270
Obro's got his bowl out.

6874
04:37:02,930 --> 04:37:05,130
That's a really nice wig.

6875
04:37:08,190 --> 04:37:08,890
I know, right?

6876
04:37:08,890 --> 04:37:10,170
You can't even tell, bro.

6877
04:37:10,990 --> 04:37:12,910
Goes into the sideburns too.

6878
04:37:13,130 --> 04:37:13,630
That looks nice.

6879
04:37:13,970 --> 04:37:16,510
The technology is kinda crazy.

6880
04:37:17,470 --> 04:37:18,990
It's all that Chipotle money.

6881
04:37:19,150 --> 04:37:20,470
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6882
04:37:20,570 --> 04:37:23,050
He's got it out because he knows he's saving money now.

6883
04:37:23,350 --> 04:37:24,430
That horse hair.

6884
04:37:24,550 --> 04:37:24,930
What is that?

6885
04:37:26,010 --> 04:37:26,930
Horse hair?

6886
04:37:28,850 --> 04:37:29,790
That looks good.

6887
04:37:35,000 --> 04:37:35,780
Slime Truth.

6888
04:37:37,940 --> 04:37:41,580
I've had Slime Truth pinned all stream at the time.

6889
04:37:41,600 --> 04:37:43,680
That's the best fucking email I've ever seen in my life.

6890
04:37:44,120 --> 04:37:47,100
Dude, you had to watch it when he made that in real time.

6891
04:37:47,280 --> 04:37:48,900
That was the funniest thing ever.

6892
04:37:49,200 --> 04:37:51,480
Dude, the fucking Photoshop AI.

6893
04:37:52,160 --> 04:37:55,560
I asked it to make him bald and it delivered me so good.

6894
04:37:56,140 --> 04:37:58,000
Maybe AI isn't so bad, bro.

6895
04:37:58,160 --> 04:38:00,000
I literally was like, you know what?

6896
04:38:00,180 --> 04:38:02,040
This is a good application of the Slime.

6897
04:38:02,040 --> 04:38:02,900
We work with the machines.

6898
04:38:03,580 --> 04:38:04,460
Dude, Slime.

6899
04:38:04,480 --> 04:38:05,200
It's a utopia.

6900
04:38:06,080 --> 04:38:10,760
At first, you were like, make him bald and then they turned him into a stock image shrugging.

6901
04:38:10,760 --> 04:38:12,320
And he was still bald.

6902
04:38:12,320 --> 04:38:12,600
It was crazy.

6903
04:38:12,780 --> 04:38:14,020
Yeah, it was funny.

6904
04:38:14,260 --> 04:38:17,700
And then to fix it, you said, make his head bald.

6905
04:38:18,100 --> 04:38:19,360
Oh, and it fixed it.

6906
04:38:19,440 --> 04:38:21,320
I'm like, what the fuck is this?

6907
04:38:21,740 --> 04:38:22,920
It's an imperfect technology.

6908
04:38:23,420 --> 04:38:27,320
If it comes to specifically making Sejam bald, I support it.

6909
04:38:27,400 --> 04:38:28,120
Only for that.

6910
04:38:29,600 --> 04:38:31,360
Make his head bald.

6911
04:38:31,900 --> 04:38:33,400
It's so redundant, but it works.

6912
04:38:33,620 --> 04:38:34,060
Can we go further?

6913
04:38:34,140 --> 04:38:34,400
Yeah.

6914
04:38:34,420 --> 04:38:35,180
Come on, Cat.

6915
04:38:36,420 --> 04:38:38,400
If Cat wins this, they only need one more set.

6916
04:38:38,580 --> 04:38:38,860
Yeah.

6917
04:38:39,580 --> 04:38:40,740
Yeah, he's gonna send us.

6918
04:38:40,760 --> 04:38:41,720
Oh, no way.

6919
04:38:42,160 --> 04:38:43,120
She could have just...

6920
04:38:43,120 --> 04:38:43,560
Oh, he's dead.

6921
04:38:43,640 --> 04:38:43,820
That's it.

6922
04:38:45,300 --> 04:38:45,700
Dude.

6923
04:38:45,760 --> 04:38:46,400
Oh, no way.

6924
04:38:46,440 --> 04:38:47,160
No way she chose.

6925
04:38:47,420 --> 04:38:48,640
Oh, no way.

6926
04:38:49,580 --> 04:38:50,380
No way.

6927
04:38:50,420 --> 04:38:50,920
That's unfortunate.

6928
04:38:51,900 --> 04:38:53,680
She could have won that.

6929
04:38:54,220 --> 04:38:54,960
She's probably...

6930
04:38:54,960 --> 04:38:56,140
I mean, they're probably super stressed.

6931
04:38:56,140 --> 04:38:56,640
You know what I mean?

6932
04:38:56,800 --> 04:38:57,100
Yeah.

6933
04:38:57,400 --> 04:38:58,980
I mean, like they're the underdogs, you know?

6934
04:39:01,600 --> 04:39:04,640
Tone's team might be on tilt from what happened with...

6935
04:39:04,640 --> 04:39:05,600
Tone's on tilt?

6936
04:39:05,880 --> 04:39:07,080
Tone's on tilt 100%.

6937
04:39:07,080 --> 04:39:08,220
Oh, yeah, yeah.

6938
04:39:08,860 --> 04:39:09,680
You can see it.

6939
04:39:09,680 --> 04:39:10,720
I did not expect this.

6940
04:39:10,740 --> 04:39:11,040
Yeah.

6941
04:39:11,580 --> 04:39:15,780
Yeah, I think your team is on tilt after what we fucking demolished them.

6942
04:39:17,360 --> 04:39:17,740
Demolished.

6943
04:39:18,340 --> 04:39:18,720
Demolished?

6944
04:39:18,720 --> 04:39:19,440
Demolished last day.

6945
04:39:19,540 --> 04:39:20,080
Yeah, yeah.

6946
04:39:20,140 --> 04:39:21,080
That's three to two.

6947
04:39:21,440 --> 04:39:21,820
Demolished.

6948
04:39:23,680 --> 04:39:24,680
Ah, it's a lot.

6949
04:39:24,920 --> 04:39:25,300
Shit.

6950
04:39:25,300 --> 04:39:25,580
Hey, I'll stay.

6951
04:39:25,680 --> 04:39:26,600
I'll call it how it is.

6952
04:39:27,760 --> 04:39:28,300
Rage Art?

6953
04:39:28,400 --> 04:39:28,520
Yeah.

6954
04:39:28,640 --> 04:39:30,000
That was the most obvious Rage Art.

6955
04:39:30,000 --> 04:39:30,200
Oh, that was a good one.

6956
04:39:30,200 --> 04:39:31,060
Dude, he just pops it.

6957
04:39:31,160 --> 04:39:32,200
Rage just lets it go.

6958
04:39:33,120 --> 04:39:34,600
Hey, if it worked, it worked, right?

6959
04:39:34,660 --> 04:39:35,440
And that gives us a set.

6960
04:39:35,480 --> 04:39:37,420
I mean, I let her rock too, you know?

6961
04:39:37,420 --> 04:39:37,800
Yeah.

6962
04:39:37,800 --> 04:39:37,940
Yeah.

6963
04:39:37,940 --> 04:39:39,740
No, I'm not saying there's anything wrong with it.

6964
04:39:39,780 --> 04:39:40,240
It's like...

6965
04:39:40,240 --> 04:39:43,700
It's great, especially with how much pressure Cat just keeps running up, but...

6966
04:39:44,280 --> 04:39:45,060
It's a good spot.

6967
04:39:46,120 --> 04:39:46,560
Yeah.

6968
04:39:47,760 --> 04:39:53,260
The harder you go in Tekken, the more it'll be like, plus frames, dash up, wait, you know, because you're afraid of the rage art.

6969
04:39:53,400 --> 04:39:53,720
Yeah.

6970
04:39:53,920 --> 04:39:58,320
Then the mind games start and it gets fucking scary.

6971
04:39:59,880 --> 04:40:00,320
Yeah.

6972
04:40:02,320 --> 04:40:03,520
Please, Fi, please.

6973
04:40:05,340 --> 04:40:06,760
I'm fucking repairing that.

6974
04:40:06,880 --> 04:40:08,520
Dude, that Chipotle unironically looks good.

6975
04:40:09,640 --> 04:40:11,920
Did you guys already use your free code?

6976
04:40:12,380 --> 04:40:13,480
Dude, I used my code.

6977
04:40:13,900 --> 04:40:18,000
I used my code for lunch today and I just saw a text message from my wife.

6978
04:40:18,060 --> 04:40:20,160
She was like, hey, I got you a Chipotle burrito.

6979
04:40:20,180 --> 04:40:20,780
It's on the stove.

6980
04:40:21,000 --> 04:40:21,820
We didn't even talk.

6981
04:40:22,020 --> 04:40:23,900
Like, she just, she just got it.

6982
04:40:23,980 --> 04:40:25,160
So now I got another one ready.

6983
04:40:26,220 --> 04:40:27,140
What the fuck?

6984
04:40:28,100 --> 04:40:29,060
That's lunch tomorrow.

6985
04:40:29,380 --> 04:40:31,220
Maybe Chipotle sponsored your wife.

6986
04:40:31,640 --> 04:40:32,080
No.

6987
04:40:34,520 --> 04:40:35,600
Oh, I love this stage.

6988
04:40:36,200 --> 04:40:36,640
Shit.

6989
04:40:36,700 --> 04:40:37,100
Nice.

6990
04:40:37,400 --> 04:40:38,340
The last round.

6991
04:40:38,340 --> 04:40:38,600
Lol.

6992
04:40:38,960 --> 04:40:42,900
Dude, the moment he didn't fucking take muscle buster, I was like, oh, it's over.

6993
04:40:43,020 --> 04:40:43,320
Did you hear?

6994
04:40:43,540 --> 04:40:43,840
Yeah.

6995
04:40:44,020 --> 04:40:44,220
Yeah.

6996
04:40:45,680 --> 04:40:46,980
No, it was an offense.

6997
04:40:47,900 --> 04:40:48,300
Yeah.

6998
04:40:48,360 --> 04:40:49,560
It's relentless.

6999
04:40:50,700 --> 04:40:51,620
There's gaps though.

7000
04:40:51,800 --> 04:40:55,200
Everything he's doing, except for that move, everything else he's doing, there's a gap.

7001
04:40:55,620 --> 04:40:56,020
Jeez.

7002
04:40:56,720 --> 04:40:58,720
Dick jab is your friend against ravenous.

7003
04:40:58,720 --> 04:40:59,180
Like that?

7004
04:40:59,340 --> 04:41:00,220
He's doing four, four.

7005
04:41:00,300 --> 04:41:06,280
You can back three him in between, or you can jab to float him.

7006
04:41:06,740 --> 04:41:07,420
What's four, four?

7007
04:41:07,420 --> 04:41:07,920
You can duck that.

7008
04:41:07,920 --> 04:41:09,140
Point it out when you see it.

7009
04:41:09,220 --> 04:41:09,820
I don't know what it is.

7010
04:41:09,900 --> 04:41:10,280
Okay, sure.

7011
04:41:10,360 --> 04:41:11,520
He did it on you a few times.

7012
04:41:12,820 --> 04:41:13,780
If I can back your hat.

7013
04:41:13,780 --> 04:41:14,440
There's that three string.

7014
04:41:16,180 --> 04:41:19,800
Yeah, see his one, two, one worked after because the third hit is that's a high.

7015
04:41:19,900 --> 04:41:21,120
It's plus if you block it.

7016
04:41:21,320 --> 04:41:22,440
She's fumbling now.

7017
04:41:23,100 --> 04:41:23,840
That was good.

7018
04:41:25,420 --> 04:41:26,360
Oh, that's good.

7019
04:41:26,780 --> 04:41:27,140
Yeah.

7020
04:41:27,160 --> 04:41:31,520
So the thing about Ray is you see he does like that double hammer down, right?

7021
04:41:31,600 --> 04:41:33,300
And it's plus and he kind of fucks on you.

7022
04:41:33,420 --> 04:41:37,900
Like he always does something that is not still.

7023
04:41:37,900 --> 04:41:39,040
Real afterwards.

7024
04:41:39,140 --> 04:41:40,960
Like he'll take an extra, extra long move.

7025
04:41:41,100 --> 04:41:45,800
So just dick jab after you see that honestly, and you fucking you beat him because he takes too many turns.

7026
04:41:46,280 --> 04:41:47,480
He's like, oh, I'm hella plus.

7027
04:41:47,620 --> 04:41:50,860
Let me do an even more slower move, but it's not airtight.

7028
04:41:51,000 --> 04:41:55,000
You know, that's my issue is I don't know how to take my turn back consistently against them.

7029
04:41:55,420 --> 04:41:58,360
It's like if I can't land the power, he's just oh my God.

7030
04:41:58,380 --> 04:41:58,680
Mix.

7031
04:41:58,800 --> 04:41:59,200
Oh my God.

7032
04:41:59,240 --> 04:41:59,500
Mix.

7033
04:41:59,540 --> 04:42:01,600
He's just oh, dude.

7034
04:42:02,340 --> 04:42:04,560
We got a block that we can't let him win with that.

7035
04:42:04,700 --> 04:42:05,420
Stupid move.

7036
04:42:05,580 --> 04:42:07,320
It's literally all he's doing, man.

7037
04:42:07,400 --> 04:42:07,720
That's the most.

7038
04:42:07,720 --> 04:42:08,800
Rodulent drag I've ever seen.

7039
04:42:08,820 --> 04:42:09,600
Oh my God.

7040
04:42:10,380 --> 04:42:11,680
That's tight, though.

7041
04:42:11,860 --> 04:42:21,540
But that's crazy because that's what we talked about is like anytime I get hit while standing for and then I just forget like when I'm in game, I'm like, uh, yeah, minus on hit.

7042
04:42:22,760 --> 04:42:29,900
Yeah, I mean, if he again, if he notices you're doing the while setting for after he can counter plate, but is rated to doing that, you know?

7043
04:42:29,900 --> 04:42:31,300
No, not not at this point.

7044
04:42:31,360 --> 04:42:32,140
He's not gonna.

7045
04:42:32,160 --> 04:42:32,800
He's not gonna.

7046
04:42:33,260 --> 04:42:34,940
He's not a grand finals.

7047
04:42:35,060 --> 04:42:37,020
He's been getting away with it so long, you know?

7048
04:42:37,720 --> 04:42:44,740
Yeah, just match for if you just see the move at all, you know, block or hit block, you get a punish hit.

7049
04:42:44,920 --> 04:42:45,860
You probably get a punish.

7050
04:42:47,020 --> 04:42:48,340
Who does Josh have to play?

7051
04:42:48,400 --> 04:42:49,600
Did he beat this guy last time?

7052
04:42:51,580 --> 04:42:52,380
Josh Fairlight.

7053
04:42:52,740 --> 04:42:54,460
Yeah, Fairlight Strong.

7054
04:42:54,780 --> 04:42:56,300
This is in favor of Fee, I think.

7055
04:42:57,240 --> 04:42:58,360
I don't have the things.

7056
04:42:58,500 --> 04:43:05,440
So it'd be Fee Tony, which which is like they played earlier and then all and then Tony had sent him to losers.

7057
04:43:05,760 --> 04:43:06,960
Yeah, at the turn.

7058
04:43:06,960 --> 04:43:10,300
Oh, wait, how did we for one box box?

7059
04:43:11,700 --> 04:43:14,480
The slime slime beat Fairlight?

7060
04:43:15,380 --> 04:43:16,640
No, no, no.

7061
04:43:16,640 --> 04:43:17,400
That's kind of nasty.

7062
04:43:18,600 --> 04:43:20,380
Wait, then we did it for I beat Kat.

7063
04:43:20,760 --> 04:43:23,240
She beat I didn't be asking.

7064
04:43:23,780 --> 04:43:24,900
No, I didn't BSK.

7065
04:43:25,500 --> 04:43:26,320
Oh, you didn't know.

7066
04:43:26,460 --> 04:43:27,960
No, I only beat Logan.

7067
04:43:28,020 --> 04:43:29,020
Just straight up lies.

7068
04:43:29,280 --> 04:43:30,040
So get in a more.

7069
04:43:31,900 --> 04:43:33,440
Okay, because I know you beat fee.

7070
04:43:33,540 --> 04:43:35,060
He beat FD and I beat Kat link.

7071
04:43:35,180 --> 04:43:35,760
Oh, okay.

7072
04:43:35,800 --> 04:43:36,720
So we just three, three, two.

7073
04:43:36,960 --> 04:43:38,060
Might be three twos.

7074
04:43:38,200 --> 04:43:39,420
Slime can be Fairlight.

7075
04:43:39,540 --> 04:43:40,400
Is this slime paying attention?

7076
04:43:40,720 --> 04:43:42,240
So I'm even paying attention.

7077
04:43:42,280 --> 04:43:43,940
Slime has better be watching true.

7078
04:43:44,300 --> 04:43:45,480
He's watching more melee.

7079
04:43:45,640 --> 04:43:46,400
I respect it.

7080
04:43:46,440 --> 04:43:47,920
Is he actually okay?

7081
04:43:48,220 --> 04:43:54,420
I'm fine ranked.

7082
04:43:55,340 --> 04:43:56,020
All right.

7083
04:43:56,060 --> 04:43:56,400
All right.

7084
04:43:56,580 --> 04:43:56,680
All right.

7085
04:43:56,740 --> 04:43:57,000
All right.

7086
04:43:57,000 --> 04:43:59,520
Yeah, he's fighting a Xiao Yu right now.

7087
04:43:59,740 --> 04:44:00,320
Oh, yeah.

7088
04:44:00,360 --> 04:44:01,400
Don't don't worry about Xiao Yu.

7089
04:44:01,460 --> 04:44:02,900
The fucking character is stupid.

7090
04:44:03,780 --> 04:44:05,000
Oh, I know.

7091
04:44:05,760 --> 04:44:06,920
I hate that guy.

7092
04:44:08,500 --> 04:44:10,860
You might have to play Fairlight slime.

7093
04:44:11,600 --> 04:44:14,780
I mean, to be fair, FD box box is a mix up.

7094
04:44:14,860 --> 04:44:16,900
Their games are so close every time.

7095
04:44:17,020 --> 04:44:17,220
Right.

7096
04:44:17,540 --> 04:44:18,820
Oh, I see.

7097
04:44:19,040 --> 04:44:20,140
We don't know how it'll go.

7098
04:44:20,320 --> 04:44:20,800
Yeah.

7099
04:44:20,840 --> 04:44:22,180
I'm just you know what?

7100
04:44:22,240 --> 04:44:23,120
I'm just enjoying the matches.

7101
04:44:23,220 --> 04:44:24,100
I'm taking my break.

7102
04:44:25,440 --> 04:44:26,400
Holy fair.

7103
04:44:27,280 --> 04:44:29,920
Like guy is goofy with these combos.

7104
04:44:32,060 --> 04:44:32,540
Compose?

7105
04:44:33,780 --> 04:44:34,260
Snake?

7106
04:44:35,200 --> 04:44:36,160
Snake edge.

7107
04:44:36,360 --> 04:44:36,840
Jumping.

7108
04:44:36,840 --> 04:44:37,440
Catch the roll.

7109
04:44:37,440 --> 04:44:38,140
What is this shit?

7110
04:44:38,560 --> 04:44:41,020
These Raijin like strats are crazy.

7111
04:44:41,220 --> 04:44:42,800
I like the shit that I see working.

7112
04:44:45,120 --> 04:44:46,340
Oh, my God.

7113
04:44:46,460 --> 04:44:47,780
He just cooked this man.

7114
04:44:48,000 --> 04:44:48,840
The slime.

7115
04:44:48,860 --> 04:44:50,220
You gotta watch your roommate.

7116
04:44:50,480 --> 04:44:52,200
He cannot tell a lie.

7117
04:44:52,280 --> 04:44:53,760
A old honest Abe.

7118
04:44:54,400 --> 04:44:55,920
Doing very honest strings.

7119
04:44:56,360 --> 04:44:57,460
Mr. President.

7120
04:44:57,760 --> 04:44:59,420
Very honest strings indeed.

7121
04:45:00,380 --> 04:45:02,580
This guy definitely does not know bang.

7122
04:45:02,920 --> 04:45:04,740
What the fuck is this?

7123
04:45:04,780 --> 04:45:05,300
What the fuck?

7124
04:45:05,320 --> 04:45:06,380
Let him get up.

7125
04:45:06,380 --> 04:45:07,080
Oh, he did.

7126
04:45:07,220 --> 04:45:09,160
That's so nice of him just to beat him up again.

7127
04:45:09,260 --> 04:45:09,480
Okay.

7128
04:45:10,400 --> 04:45:11,380
Oh, no, he's about to.

7129
04:45:11,400 --> 04:45:11,660
Okay.

7130
04:45:11,740 --> 04:45:12,460
He did the good pose.

7131
04:45:12,620 --> 04:45:12,900
All right.

7132
04:45:14,820 --> 04:45:16,400
I thought he was about to do something.

7133
04:45:16,440 --> 04:45:17,560
I had to turn the camera off.

7134
04:45:17,560 --> 04:45:18,840
What's the other pose, Kony?

7135
04:45:19,320 --> 04:45:20,460
Oh, you know the other one.

7136
04:45:20,560 --> 04:45:21,140
You've seen it.

7137
04:45:21,200 --> 04:45:22,060
I don't like that one.

7138
04:45:22,600 --> 04:45:24,020
The double L's is fine.

7139
04:45:24,260 --> 04:45:25,180
The other one is fine.

7140
04:45:25,960 --> 04:45:26,660
Is it over?

7141
04:45:26,740 --> 04:45:26,920
Wait.

7142
04:45:27,140 --> 04:45:29,100
Is it all over?

7143
04:45:29,240 --> 04:45:29,940
Or is it just one?

7144
04:45:29,940 --> 04:45:30,100
Not yet.

7145
04:45:30,200 --> 04:45:30,380
No.

7146
04:45:30,700 --> 04:45:31,020
No.

7147
04:45:31,020 --> 04:45:31,560
There's still one.

7148
04:45:31,660 --> 04:45:32,900
He just won one round.

7149
04:45:33,980 --> 04:45:34,280
Yeah.

7150
04:45:34,800 --> 04:45:35,120
Yeah.

7151
04:45:35,120 --> 04:45:35,300
Yeah.

7152
04:45:35,300 --> 04:45:36,200
But that was a three-oh though.

7153
04:45:36,200 --> 04:45:36,780
No.

7154
04:45:36,980 --> 04:45:37,820
Yeah, that was a three-oh.

7155
04:45:38,020 --> 04:45:38,320
Yeah.

7156
04:45:38,460 --> 04:45:40,140
I don't think Josh knows Feng at all.

7157
04:45:40,220 --> 04:45:41,080
So it's probably gonna be a while.

7158
04:45:41,600 --> 04:45:42,420
Oh, I see.

7159
04:45:42,480 --> 04:45:42,660
Rune.

7160
04:45:42,720 --> 04:45:42,900
Okay.

7161
04:45:42,940 --> 04:45:46,340
But Slime, you can see the things that the Fairlight is doing.

7162
04:45:46,480 --> 04:45:48,000
And he's the same rank as you.

7163
04:45:48,120 --> 04:45:48,900
I mean...

7164
04:45:48,900 --> 04:45:49,620
Yeah.

7165
04:45:49,780 --> 04:45:50,180
...doable.

7166
04:45:50,340 --> 04:45:54,340
And Slime, you never do while running one plus two into bear stance into the grab.

7167
04:45:54,500 --> 04:45:55,200
You never...

7168
04:45:55,200 --> 04:45:55,460
Yeah.

7169
04:45:55,820 --> 04:46:01,560
I got into matchmaking to practice that, to get used to that because I realized it is not something I've been doing.

7170
04:46:01,760 --> 04:46:02,540
We got more...

7171
04:46:02,540 --> 04:46:04,260
I did it to that Chao Yu twice.

7172
04:46:05,280 --> 04:46:05,700
Got her.

7173
04:46:05,700 --> 04:46:06,060
And remember...

7174
04:46:06,060 --> 04:46:06,620
Got her ass.

7175
04:46:06,740 --> 04:46:07,580
Back one plus two.

7176
04:46:07,640 --> 04:46:09,160
Bear stance one plus two.

7177
04:46:09,280 --> 04:46:09,680
It's...

7178
04:46:09,680 --> 04:46:10,580
You can just throw it up.

7179
04:46:11,020 --> 04:46:12,460
I actually want Josh to win so bad.

7180
04:46:12,900 --> 04:46:15,480
I don't want to play him, but I can't...

7181
04:46:15,480 --> 04:46:16,600
I can't root against him here.

7182
04:46:16,780 --> 04:46:17,100
Yeah.

7183
04:46:17,180 --> 04:46:17,460
Yeah.

7184
04:46:17,620 --> 04:46:17,980
Of course.

7185
04:46:18,020 --> 04:46:20,040
I mean, I want Josh to win, bro.

7186
04:46:21,580 --> 04:46:21,980
Yeah.

7187
04:46:22,020 --> 04:46:25,660
I mean, I want Josh to lose, but you know...

7188
04:46:27,120 --> 04:46:27,860
He's a sweetheart.

7189
04:46:27,880 --> 04:46:29,260
I love the guy, but...

7190
04:46:29,260 --> 04:46:31,800
I just hope as many people come to EVO as possible.

7191
04:46:32,000 --> 04:46:33,460
Win or lose, whoever, you know.

7192
04:46:33,460 --> 04:46:33,800
Absolutely.

7193
04:46:33,880 --> 04:46:34,060
Yeah.

7194
04:46:34,100 --> 04:46:35,260
He's a sweetheart, dude.

7195
04:46:35,260 --> 04:46:39,880
Dude, when he first saw me in Slime's chat, he's like, oh, Slime, that's the dick writer.

7196
04:46:40,040 --> 04:46:40,820
Bro, bro.

7197
04:46:40,880 --> 04:46:41,500
I'm like, what?

7198
04:46:43,700 --> 04:46:46,020
I was like, that's my student brother.

7199
04:46:46,200 --> 04:46:47,000
What do you mean?

7200
04:46:47,100 --> 04:46:48,800
I got to hype him up.

7201
04:46:50,280 --> 04:46:50,680
Yeah.

7202
04:46:50,780 --> 04:46:51,180
He's...

7203
04:46:51,180 --> 04:46:53,420
He barks a lot, but it's zero bite.

7204
04:46:53,460 --> 04:46:55,660
That does not look like Brian.

7205
04:46:56,120 --> 04:46:58,200
This skin is disarming.

7206
04:46:58,500 --> 04:47:00,900
Like, that's a normal guy.

7207
04:47:01,240 --> 04:47:02,680
He looks like...

7208
04:47:02,680 --> 04:47:05,920
I think he was in the Gathering commercial in like the 90s where they're like, what's this about?

7209
04:47:05,980 --> 04:47:07,100
And they're like cool rad dudes.

7210
04:47:07,740 --> 04:47:08,780
I'll link it to you guys.

7211
04:47:08,980 --> 04:47:09,200
No.

7212
04:47:09,200 --> 04:47:10,200
He looks like that.

7213
04:47:10,220 --> 04:47:11,800
He looks like one of those guys.

7214
04:47:12,100 --> 04:47:14,060
That is such a specific reference.

7215
04:47:14,440 --> 04:47:16,500
He looks like a guy from a Mentos commercial.

7216
04:47:16,860 --> 04:47:17,480
Is that the one?

7217
04:47:17,480 --> 04:47:18,520
You're going to instantly get it.

7218
04:47:19,560 --> 04:47:22,920
I feel like I can already imagine the commercial based on what you're saying.

7219
04:47:22,960 --> 04:47:23,080
What?

7220
04:47:24,720 --> 04:47:25,640
Oh my God.

7221
04:47:25,740 --> 04:47:26,720
These guys are gaming.

7222
04:47:27,020 --> 04:47:29,120
They're just fucking punching each other.

7223
04:47:30,100 --> 04:47:31,320
Oh my God.

7224
04:47:31,520 --> 04:47:31,940
Oh my God.

7225
04:47:31,940 --> 04:47:33,680
He looks like the guy from Streets of Rage.

7226
04:47:33,780 --> 04:47:34,340
Oh, Axel?

7227
04:47:34,440 --> 04:47:34,720
Kinda.

7228
04:47:35,280 --> 04:47:36,480
That's just a white shirt and jeans.

7229
04:47:36,600 --> 04:47:37,160
Who's he supposed to be?

7230
04:47:37,280 --> 04:47:38,380
Isn't he supposed to be someone?

7231
04:47:38,720 --> 04:47:39,480
Is he Leon?

7232
04:47:39,840 --> 04:47:41,600
Leon, but like Leon the weird.

7233
04:47:43,040 --> 04:47:43,780
Streetwear Leon.

7234
04:47:44,060 --> 04:47:44,720
90s Leon.

7235
04:47:45,340 --> 04:47:46,900
What the fuck is this commercial?

7236
04:47:48,340 --> 04:47:49,220
It's like a...

7237
04:47:49,220 --> 04:47:52,740
It's like an MTV spot actually for Magic the Gathering.

7238
04:47:53,000 --> 04:47:55,160
Dude, I'm going to keep it $100 with you.

7239
04:47:55,220 --> 04:47:56,140
I've never seen this.

7240
04:47:56,760 --> 04:47:57,560
This is insane.

7241
04:47:57,640 --> 04:47:57,820
Yeah.

7242
04:47:57,880 --> 04:48:01,800
I didn't know it either until I started watching Magic the Gathering YouTube, which I don't know if it's a game.

7243
04:48:02,220 --> 04:48:03,140
Pony Young confirmed?

7244
04:48:03,600 --> 04:48:04,120
I feel like Tony...

7245
04:48:04,120 --> 04:48:06,180
Slime, I have a question because you're as old as me.

7246
04:48:06,220 --> 04:48:10,500
Did you used to watch like MTV Spring Break and be like, hell yeah, that's going to be me someday.

7247
04:48:11,000 --> 04:48:11,940
No, I used to.

7248
04:48:11,960 --> 04:48:12,700
No, you know what?

7249
04:48:12,760 --> 04:48:13,240
I used to watch it.

7250
04:48:13,240 --> 04:48:14,040
I wanted to be so cool.

7251
04:48:14,860 --> 04:48:16,720
I watched it and I said, I hate this.

7252
04:48:16,760 --> 04:48:18,100
I wanted to go back to normal MTV.

7253
04:48:19,260 --> 04:48:20,640
Barely won by the way.

7254
04:48:20,880 --> 04:48:23,020
You didn't watch like Singled Out and were like, hell yeah.

7255
04:48:23,140 --> 04:48:24,320
No, I thought it was cringe.

7256
04:48:24,380 --> 04:48:27,260
Except my friend's sister who had a crush on, she liked Blink 182.

7257
04:48:27,580 --> 04:48:29,440
So we would watch MTV together.

7258
04:48:29,780 --> 04:48:30,720
She'd be like, oh my God.

7259
04:48:30,760 --> 04:48:31,420
Let's watch MTV.

7260
04:48:31,440 --> 04:48:31,940
TV Spring Break.

7261
04:48:32,000 --> 04:48:32,960
I'm like, yeah, of course.

7262
04:48:33,080 --> 04:48:33,540
I love that.

7263
04:48:36,280 --> 04:48:39,460
I used to watch that shit with like, you know, the big stage.

7264
04:48:39,520 --> 04:48:44,080
I was like, damn, one day I'm going to be a cool 21 year old on Spring Break.

7265
04:48:44,140 --> 04:48:45,420
And like, it just never happened.

7266
04:48:45,460 --> 04:48:46,000
And what happened?

7267
04:48:46,360 --> 04:48:46,820
You know what I mean?

7268
04:48:47,040 --> 04:48:48,340
I played Brawl and spit.

7269
04:48:49,460 --> 04:48:49,840
Yeah.

7270
04:48:50,880 --> 04:48:53,820
I think you went in the exact opposite direction.

7271
04:48:54,320 --> 04:48:54,700
Yeah.

7272
04:48:54,860 --> 04:48:55,140
Yeah.

7273
04:48:55,260 --> 04:48:55,540
I...

7274
04:48:55,540 --> 04:48:58,080
The hardest opposite direction you possibly could have.

7275
04:48:58,280 --> 04:48:58,660
Yeah.

7276
04:48:59,020 --> 04:49:00,300
Besides becoming Amish.

7277
04:49:06,600 --> 04:49:07,080
Wow.

7278
04:49:07,200 --> 04:49:09,960
Feze team is all streaming in discord.

7279
04:49:10,140 --> 04:49:10,660
It's so weird.

7280
04:49:10,800 --> 04:49:14,620
Oh, they're, they're hard, like coaching, like live coaching, maybe.

7281
04:49:15,100 --> 04:49:16,360
That's all I took it.

7282
04:49:16,520 --> 04:49:17,720
There is no delay.

7283
04:49:18,320 --> 04:49:19,640
I'll play against Freaky Bryan.

7284
04:49:19,860 --> 04:49:21,520
You hear nothing from brawl pro.

7285
04:49:23,700 --> 04:49:27,420
I hear crickets from him, dude.

7286
04:49:27,480 --> 04:49:28,180
Are you serious?

7287
04:49:28,240 --> 04:49:28,620
I don't want to.

7288
04:49:30,080 --> 04:49:30,800
Freaky Bryan.

7289
04:49:30,860 --> 04:49:31,000
Freaky Bryan.

7290
04:49:31,000 --> 04:49:31,420
He's too freaky bro.

7291
04:49:31,420 --> 04:49:31,560
Freaky!

7292
04:49:31,680 --> 04:49:33,760
I want freaky answers and I get nothing.

7293
04:49:34,660 --> 04:49:35,300
Freaky answers!

7294
04:49:36,680 --> 04:49:39,680
I wanna say so much but I don't wanna throw you off dude.

7295
04:49:39,840 --> 04:49:41,180
Play the Goosebumps theme bro.

7296
04:49:41,280 --> 04:49:42,940
If you jump that high you'll get a freaky launcher.

7297
04:49:45,800 --> 04:49:47,360
Just say it like that?

7298
04:49:47,460 --> 04:49:48,720
Yeah, send it man.

7299
04:49:50,120 --> 04:49:51,080
Freaky launcher!

7300
04:49:53,240 --> 04:49:54,620
Shit go extra high!

7301
04:49:56,180 --> 04:49:57,300
Wait, pay attention Matt.

7302
04:49:57,800 --> 04:49:59,120
What do you mean pay attention?

7303
04:49:59,840 --> 04:50:01,200
Dude, this is Freaky Eddy.

7304
04:50:01,300 --> 04:50:01,860
What do you mean?

7305
04:50:02,060 --> 04:50:03,920
Oh yeah, he's gonna pull an Eddy on you!

7306
04:50:04,260 --> 04:50:05,980
Yeah bro, we're talking freaks!

7307
04:50:06,400 --> 04:50:08,420
Like dude, you're gonna fight this shit bro.

7308
04:50:08,460 --> 04:50:09,740
None of us trained for this!

7309
04:50:11,240 --> 04:50:13,260
Sicko mode combos and stuff.

7310
04:50:13,520 --> 04:50:13,920
Damage.

7311
04:50:14,540 --> 04:50:15,180
Oh my god.

7312
04:50:16,820 --> 04:50:18,000
Eddy's freaky too man.

7313
04:50:18,220 --> 04:50:19,620
When he gets it on his hands...

7314
04:50:19,620 --> 04:50:22,820
If he feels a little freaky he goes with the two.

7315
04:50:26,680 --> 04:50:28,820
Eddy players be like, I wanna mix this up today.

7316
04:50:29,380 --> 04:50:29,820
Two!

7317
04:50:30,700 --> 04:50:31,900
How about a punch?

7318
04:50:33,800 --> 04:50:34,840
Oh my god, armor.

7319
04:50:35,100 --> 04:50:36,960
Let me use my hands for one second.

7320
04:50:37,140 --> 04:50:37,460
To the mid.

7321
04:50:38,640 --> 04:50:39,880
Bro, I love this stage.

7322
04:50:40,120 --> 04:50:43,140
I think if she does it, it goes low 7 billion times.

7323
04:50:43,240 --> 04:50:43,640
Is that real?

7324
04:50:44,500 --> 04:50:46,000
No, but does he know...

7325
04:50:46,000 --> 04:50:49,860
I was gonna say, does he have experience knowing that that's safe if she charges?

7326
04:50:50,280 --> 04:50:51,940
It's not just safe, it's plus.

7327
04:50:51,940 --> 04:50:53,300
It's unfair to her.

7328
04:50:53,460 --> 04:50:54,360
Oh, okay, shit.

7329
04:50:55,020 --> 04:50:55,460
Boom.

7330
04:50:55,460 --> 04:50:56,360
It's her turn.

7331
04:50:57,520 --> 04:50:59,000
I don't know why he did that.

7332
04:50:59,000 --> 04:51:00,240
If he wins this, then they...

7333
04:51:01,200 --> 04:51:02,680
Then we fight them, yeah.

7334
04:51:03,000 --> 04:51:05,860
This is gonna hurt so bad because like, EVO's on the line here.

7335
04:51:06,040 --> 04:51:07,040
So like, this guy...

7336
04:51:07,040 --> 04:51:09,060
This is what we were experiencing, right?

7337
04:51:09,300 --> 04:51:09,580
Yeah.

7338
04:51:11,560 --> 04:51:12,680
Now you're right.

7339
04:51:13,020 --> 04:51:14,160
I feel like...

7340
04:51:14,160 --> 04:51:18,800
I feel like T0ke's team didn't train for this team.

7341
04:51:19,100 --> 04:51:19,760
At all.

7342
04:51:21,660 --> 04:51:22,340
Bucks, bucks.

7343
04:51:22,340 --> 04:51:23,780
T0ke, I don't think you're wrong, man.

7344
04:51:23,900 --> 04:51:26,380
I think, seriously, people trained for us.

7345
04:51:26,520 --> 04:51:26,820
Yeah.

7346
04:51:26,820 --> 04:51:28,100
Because that happened last time too.

7347
04:51:28,780 --> 04:51:33,180
Yeah, because I did not expect T0ne's team to not do that well against V's team.

7348
04:51:33,620 --> 04:51:34,060
Yeah.

7349
04:51:36,420 --> 04:51:37,980
Because they knew all our shit.

7350
04:51:38,140 --> 04:51:39,800
I was like, what the fuck?

7351
04:51:40,380 --> 04:51:40,580
Yeah.

7352
04:51:42,660 --> 04:51:43,100
Nice.

7353
04:51:43,280 --> 04:51:45,160
Dude, and BoxBox really wanted to win.

7354
04:51:45,540 --> 04:51:45,980
Yeah.

7355
04:51:47,920 --> 04:51:49,680
One more set, one more set.

7356
04:51:50,600 --> 04:51:51,640
For the boys of Rio.

7357
04:51:53,300 --> 04:51:54,180
For the boys of Rio.

7358
04:51:55,800 --> 04:51:56,320
Damn.

7359
04:51:58,020 --> 04:52:00,440
So maybe they just focused on us.

7360
04:52:00,520 --> 04:52:00,740
Yeah.

7361
04:52:01,980 --> 04:52:04,720
Do we know how to fight against V's team?

7362
04:52:05,080 --> 04:52:05,400
Like...

7363
04:52:06,580 --> 04:52:07,100
Well...

7364
04:52:07,720 --> 04:52:12,640
We won 3-2, which means it was a coach match.

7365
04:52:13,400 --> 04:52:15,200
Alright, bro, bro, you ready?

7366
04:52:15,840 --> 04:52:16,620
Alright, bro, bro, you ready?

7367
04:52:16,620 --> 04:52:17,700
That's assuming I beat FD.

7368
04:52:17,860 --> 04:52:20,340
And last time that shit was literally one hit.

7369
04:52:21,100 --> 04:52:21,620
Yeah.

7370
04:52:22,340 --> 04:52:23,080
We'll see.

7371
04:52:24,640 --> 04:52:26,340
But I know the matchup better now.

7372
04:52:26,660 --> 04:52:31,420
In the end, the fans will remember us as first place winners.

7373
04:52:32,560 --> 04:52:34,480
We will rewrite history again.

7374
04:52:35,080 --> 04:52:36,900
We will rewrite history again.

7375
04:52:36,900 --> 04:52:37,420
Ugh.

7376
04:52:37,780 --> 04:52:39,180
Another silver medal, eh?

7377
04:52:39,340 --> 04:52:40,540
I can't take it.

7378
04:52:43,140 --> 04:52:47,540
You better be watching the farlight fight then.

7379
04:52:47,960 --> 04:52:48,400
You better be watching the farlight fight then.

7380
04:52:48,400 --> 04:52:49,360
I really actually should.

7381
04:52:49,580 --> 04:52:52,320
I really actually should.

7382
04:52:52,320 --> 04:52:53,680
I'm not stupid fucking, uh...

7383
04:52:54,160 --> 04:52:55,040
Like, while standing for this.

7384
04:52:55,180 --> 04:52:55,840
Fake as shit, right?

7385
04:52:56,000 --> 04:52:56,540
He just did?

7386
04:52:57,260 --> 04:52:58,480
He just did it twice, right?

7387
04:52:59,560 --> 04:53:00,500
Bro, bro, coach!

7388
04:53:01,900 --> 04:53:02,480
I'm here.

7389
04:53:02,600 --> 04:53:03,360
I'm sorry, dude.

7390
04:53:03,440 --> 04:53:03,720
I'm sorry.

7391
04:53:03,980 --> 04:53:05,900
Coach, the one time I asked you a question...

7392
04:53:05,900 --> 04:53:07,680
Coach, is it real or is it not real?

7393
04:53:09,260 --> 04:53:09,860
Young man.

7394
04:53:09,960 --> 04:53:13,880
I asked you one question throughout the entire Sajam Slam and the first one and you're not here.

7395
04:53:14,280 --> 04:53:17,280
If FD's fire did it, it's not real, bro.

7396
04:53:17,520 --> 04:53:18,400
Oh my goodness.

7397
04:53:20,780 --> 04:53:22,120
Coach, do something.

7398
04:53:22,880 --> 04:53:25,760
Dude, they're posting ASCII art and I had to ban them.

7399
04:53:25,860 --> 04:53:26,040
Sorry.

7400
04:53:26,240 --> 04:53:26,900
Oh my goodness.

7401
04:53:27,060 --> 04:53:28,820
Wasn't it bald Mario smoking a cigarette?

7402
04:53:29,400 --> 04:53:30,880
No, it was just titties.

7403
04:53:33,100 --> 04:53:33,680
Keep it up.

7404
04:53:33,680 --> 04:53:34,740
Old stand-by's, honestly.

7405
04:53:35,180 --> 04:53:35,620
Classic.

7406
04:53:37,060 --> 04:53:39,460
Oh my god, what is that?

7407
04:53:39,520 --> 04:53:40,200
Crazy rage art.

7408
04:53:40,200 --> 04:53:41,340
What did he do, Matt?

7409
04:53:41,720 --> 04:53:46,200
He was doing the stupid down back three and then while standing four.

7410
04:53:46,660 --> 04:53:50,080
And you were like, that's minus five and he's taking his turn at the launch.

7411
04:53:50,260 --> 04:53:50,660
Right?

7412
04:53:50,780 --> 04:53:51,040
You remember?

7413
04:53:52,520 --> 04:53:52,880
Yes.

7414
04:53:53,380 --> 04:53:55,200
No, it wasn't because he still had his heat.

7415
04:53:56,000 --> 04:53:56,740
Oh, got you.

7416
04:53:56,940 --> 04:53:59,060
Also, Matt, he stopped doing it.

7417
04:53:59,100 --> 04:54:00,780
I haven't seen him do that shit one time yet.

7418
04:54:01,140 --> 04:54:02,380
He just did it twice.

7419
04:54:03,060 --> 04:54:03,780
That's not...

7420
04:54:03,780 --> 04:54:05,540
That right there, that's fake as fuck.

7421
04:54:05,980 --> 04:54:06,880
That's what I'm saying.

7422
04:54:07,220 --> 04:54:09,200
Yeah, down forward two if he hits you with that low.

7423
04:54:10,080 --> 04:54:13,620
But he is finishing that string sometimes, which he gets a free crouch throw after.

7424
04:54:14,100 --> 04:54:16,320
Dude, Pox, get me the fuck out of here.

7425
04:54:16,480 --> 04:54:16,960
I don't want to play.

7426
04:54:17,060 --> 04:54:17,620
Get me out.

7427
04:54:17,680 --> 04:54:17,920
Help.

7428
04:54:18,940 --> 04:54:19,900
He's too freaky.

7429
04:54:20,840 --> 04:54:22,000
Freaky Eddy is real.

7430
04:54:22,180 --> 04:54:26,200
Eddy is like that guy you find in Sekiro in the really small area with the claws.

7431
04:54:26,400 --> 04:54:27,380
Like the centipede guy.

7432
04:54:27,640 --> 04:54:29,080
That's how I feel when I watch him.

7433
04:54:29,980 --> 04:54:31,980
The guy you got to parry eight million times.

7434
04:54:32,400 --> 04:54:32,740
Yeah.

7435
04:54:33,140 --> 04:54:34,320
Oh, I hate that guy.

7436
04:54:34,520 --> 04:54:35,600
Oh my god, what a parry.

7437
04:54:35,780 --> 04:54:37,200
Oh my god.

7438
04:54:38,580 --> 04:54:39,640
Oh my god.

7439
04:54:39,780 --> 04:54:42,380
Oh, did he miss?

7440
04:54:42,540 --> 04:54:43,260
Damn, dude.

7441
04:54:44,480 --> 04:54:47,020
Well, we're playing against Fii's team.

7442
04:54:47,720 --> 04:54:49,580
What a way to lose, man.

7443
04:54:49,620 --> 04:54:50,040
That sucks.

7444
04:54:50,280 --> 04:54:51,180
Damn, dude.

7445
04:54:51,420 --> 04:54:52,280
We gatekept.

7446
04:54:52,280 --> 04:54:55,540
We did what we said we were going to do.

7447
04:54:55,580 --> 04:54:57,080
We actually gatekept Toto the fuck again.

7448
04:54:57,100 --> 04:54:58,660
We did what we said we were going to do.

7449
04:54:58,720 --> 04:54:59,860
We gatekept.

7450
04:55:00,840 --> 04:55:02,500
Oh, Evo for E-Sam.

7451
04:55:03,720 --> 04:55:06,140
No, Evo for E-Sam.

7452
04:55:06,260 --> 04:55:06,680
Yo.

7453
04:55:07,720 --> 04:55:09,020
We actually gatekept.

7454
04:55:11,080 --> 04:55:13,920
We are the most toxic team I know in here.

7455
04:55:14,160 --> 04:55:16,080
That's what you get for smurfing.

7456
04:55:16,480 --> 04:55:17,000
That's what you get for smurfing.

7457
04:55:17,020 --> 04:55:18,220
Yeah, fucking E-Sam.

7458
04:55:18,540 --> 04:55:20,920
Yeah, that's what you get for wanting it so bad, dude.

7459
04:55:21,020 --> 04:55:21,300
Yeah.

7460
04:55:21,480 --> 04:55:23,180
Just wait.

7461
04:55:23,300 --> 04:55:24,660
Just let it come to your lap.

7462
04:55:25,680 --> 04:55:27,200
We have Jack Jesus.

7463
04:55:27,340 --> 04:55:31,520
Jack Jesus is the most valuable ore found in any mine ever.

7464
04:55:33,040 --> 04:55:33,800
It's Mithril.

7465
04:55:34,420 --> 04:55:36,140
Yeah, it's like...

7466
04:55:38,040 --> 04:55:43,180
I just watched that big robot get on the screen and I'm like, it's just going to be a good day.

7467
04:55:44,820 --> 04:55:46,260
He's so fun to watch.

7468
04:55:47,020 --> 04:55:47,500
That's true.

7469
04:55:48,880 --> 04:55:53,700
You like, you like look at, look away for one second and then 80% of the health is gone.

7470
04:55:54,180 --> 04:55:56,520
I'm considering bringing out the Kossack kicks.

7471
04:55:56,820 --> 04:55:57,300
BrawlPro.

7472
04:55:57,860 --> 04:55:58,340
Thoughts?

7473
04:56:00,100 --> 04:56:02,540
And once again, once again, follow here.

7474
04:56:02,820 --> 04:56:04,280
No, no, I'm done with you.

7475
04:56:04,420 --> 04:56:04,700
I'm done.

7476
04:56:04,760 --> 04:56:06,360
He any kicks with real kicks.

7477
04:56:06,420 --> 04:56:06,700
Bro, bro, bro.

7478
04:56:07,920 --> 04:56:10,080
If we lose, actually your fault.

7479
04:56:10,120 --> 04:56:12,620
Bro, do not Kossack kick, brother.

7480
04:56:12,720 --> 04:56:13,240
There it is.

7481
04:56:13,360 --> 04:56:14,060
Don't do it.

7482
04:56:14,440 --> 04:56:17,360
Do that move where you sit on your butt and then you swing your arms a lot.

7483
04:56:17,420 --> 04:56:18,680
That's what I was gonna do.

7484
04:56:18,880 --> 04:56:20,400
Oh my god, yes, there's more fan art.

7485
04:56:21,140 --> 04:56:21,820
Try that.

7486
04:56:22,380 --> 04:56:23,840
Oh my god, that fan art's sick.

7487
04:56:23,940 --> 04:56:24,820
I'm retweeting this one too.

7488
04:56:25,940 --> 04:56:27,460
There's a lot of good fan art, bro.

7489
04:56:27,620 --> 04:56:28,720
Wait, we got more fan art?

7490
04:56:28,780 --> 04:56:29,040
Yeah.

7491
04:56:30,320 --> 04:56:31,700
There's like four to the one.

7492
04:56:32,200 --> 04:56:33,420
Oh, new ones?

7493
04:56:33,700 --> 04:56:34,220
Oh shit.

7494
04:56:34,380 --> 04:56:35,580
Hold on, I gotta check them out.

7495
04:56:36,020 --> 04:56:37,820
Damn, these are sick, dude.

7496
04:56:38,240 --> 04:56:39,260
That's good, man.

7497
04:56:39,940 --> 04:56:41,020
Unironically pulling up.

7498
04:56:42,080 --> 04:56:43,040
What the?

7499
04:56:43,180 --> 04:56:45,140
That is crazy, bro.

7500
04:56:45,400 --> 04:56:46,540
Oh my god, nice.

7501
04:56:46,880 --> 04:56:47,960
You're in the limo, bro?

7502
04:56:48,320 --> 04:56:53,480
Bro, look at slime just fucking chilling up there on top of the limo.

7503
04:56:55,980 --> 04:56:58,940
They have the costumes we're using too.

7504
04:56:59,000 --> 04:57:00,440
Because I always use that color.

7505
04:57:01,860 --> 04:57:02,820
Wow, that's sick.

7506
04:57:05,700 --> 04:57:07,580
This is us pulling up to Evo.

7507
04:57:08,820 --> 04:57:10,380
We should rent a limo.

7508
04:57:12,440 --> 04:57:12,860
Wow.

7509
04:57:12,900 --> 04:57:14,360
I'm fucking down.

7510
04:57:16,580 --> 04:57:18,720
I'm currently on top of the world.

7511
04:57:19,160 --> 04:57:20,540
Alright, fellas, one more set.

7512
04:57:20,780 --> 04:57:21,200
Alright.

7513
04:57:21,940 --> 04:57:22,640
Perhaps two.

7514
04:57:22,880 --> 04:57:24,320
One more, perhaps two.

7515
04:57:24,380 --> 04:57:25,160
We're on top.

7516
04:57:25,300 --> 04:57:26,180
Let's just finish up.

7517
04:57:26,280 --> 04:57:27,500
Oh shit, they're about to do the interview.

7518
04:57:27,680 --> 04:57:28,240
Let's get them, coach.

7519
04:57:28,480 --> 04:57:29,260
Alright, yeah, coach.

7520
04:57:29,980 --> 04:57:30,820
Gas us up.

7521
04:57:31,120 --> 04:57:34,260
Tell them how we feel, bro.

7522
04:57:34,340 --> 04:57:34,800
Tell them how we feel.

7523
04:57:34,800 --> 04:57:36,440
Wait, how do I counter SK?

7524
04:57:38,060 --> 04:57:39,400
Where are my notes?

7525
04:57:39,780 --> 04:57:41,000
This fucking coach is...

7526
04:57:42,180 --> 04:57:43,120
I'm here, I'm here.

7527
04:57:43,460 --> 04:57:45,300
Where are my notes against SK?

7528
04:57:46,000 --> 04:57:48,400
He's more preoccupied with the interview, bro.

7529
04:57:48,500 --> 04:57:49,660
He's up here for the clout.

7530
04:57:49,780 --> 04:57:50,200
It's Hollywood.

7531
04:57:51,260 --> 04:57:52,800
Everyone says he's Hollywood now.

7532
04:57:53,000 --> 04:57:53,960
He switched off.

7533
04:57:54,760 --> 04:57:56,280
He thinks he's too good for us.

7534
04:57:56,280 --> 04:57:57,680
I get to be on SageM stream?

7535
04:57:58,140 --> 04:57:58,820
He let us go.

7536
04:57:59,920 --> 04:58:00,700
Come on now.

7537
04:58:01,680 --> 04:58:02,480
He's too Hollywood.

7538
04:58:02,480 --> 04:58:03,740
He's actually too Hollywood.

7539
04:58:03,820 --> 04:58:07,020
He said he'd give us notes and then he didn't.

7540
04:58:07,020 --> 04:58:07,980
It's true.

7541
04:58:08,080 --> 04:58:08,960
The video's real.

7542
04:58:09,060 --> 04:58:09,780
He's too Hollywood.

7543
04:58:10,820 --> 04:58:13,200
I knew something was up when he got all handsome.

7544
04:58:13,340 --> 04:58:14,000
I see that now.

7545
04:58:16,080 --> 04:58:17,980
That fame came got to his head.

7546
04:58:18,200 --> 04:58:22,200
He won two coaches matches and now he thinks he's better than us.

7547
04:58:22,600 --> 04:58:23,380
He won two coaches matches and now he thinks he's better than us.

7548
04:58:23,380 --> 04:58:23,400
Hold on.

7549
04:58:23,580 --> 04:58:26,500
I will DM SK, ask her to throw.

7550
04:58:26,700 --> 04:58:27,620
Maybe it will help.

7551
04:58:29,460 --> 04:58:31,280
I mean, they're already going to EVO.

7552
04:58:31,280 --> 04:58:32,200
What do they care, right?

7553
04:58:32,600 --> 04:58:33,040
Yeah.

7554
04:58:33,040 --> 04:58:36,380
Hello, can you throw for God's sake?

7555
04:58:37,960 --> 04:58:40,740
It would be like the biggest character arc for me.

7556
04:58:40,860 --> 04:58:41,780
It would be so good.

7557
04:58:41,900 --> 04:58:43,480
Imagine the clips.

7558
04:58:44,980 --> 04:58:47,580
Say that we'll win trade.

7559
04:58:48,540 --> 04:58:49,540
Say we'll win trade.

7560
04:58:49,540 --> 04:58:52,540
Give Doki the win and I'll trade my FD win.

7561
04:58:56,160 --> 04:59:00,440
Tell to the world while all of us are streaming that we'll win trade.

7562
04:59:00,900 --> 04:59:02,640
Give Doki the win.

7563
04:59:03,300 --> 04:59:04,460
That will throw.

7564
04:59:04,760 --> 04:59:07,140
I swear, I cross my heart.

7565
04:59:07,200 --> 04:59:07,720
I hope to die.

7566
04:59:07,800 --> 04:59:09,960
I will literally I will play like shit.

7567
04:59:10,040 --> 04:59:10,820
Brain off moment.

7568
04:59:11,220 --> 04:59:13,480
We're doing business at the table.

7569
04:59:13,500 --> 04:59:14,360
We're running it twice.

7570
04:59:14,720 --> 04:59:16,900
All of this is for content, right?

7571
04:59:17,120 --> 04:59:18,980
Just think about the clips.

7572
04:59:20,900 --> 04:59:23,780
He fucking proposed showing it on stream.

7573
04:59:28,000 --> 04:59:29,700
I'm definitely going to hear this interview.

7574
04:59:30,840 --> 04:59:38,700
All I'm saying is that if I win against SK, just imagine the amount of views we're going to get for both of us.

7575
04:59:44,920 --> 04:59:45,640
Lobby's up.

7576
04:59:46,640 --> 04:59:47,640
Oh, alright.

7577
04:59:48,860 --> 04:59:49,520
Lobby's up.

7578
04:59:53,370 --> 04:59:55,450
Don't worry, we'll edit this out during post, guys.

7579
04:59:55,690 --> 04:59:56,550
They'll never know.

7580
04:59:59,960 --> 05:00:01,860
They'll never know there was match fixing.

7581
05:00:10,230 --> 05:00:12,330
I like how the passwords are so complicated.

7582
05:00:12,590 --> 05:00:13,950
But we're all showing it on stream.

7583
05:00:17,170 --> 05:00:19,190
I don't have the elements like BrawlPro.

7584
05:00:20,450 --> 05:00:22,750
I don't have a PNG to cover it.

7585
05:00:23,650 --> 05:00:25,570
Wait, is BrawlPro actually covering it?

7586
05:00:26,610 --> 05:00:28,430
No, no, he said I don't have the elements.

7587
05:00:28,450 --> 05:00:29,390
Oh, yeah, it's true.

7588
05:00:29,450 --> 05:00:30,170
I cannot cover it.

7589
05:00:30,610 --> 05:00:30,750
Me too.

7590
05:00:30,870 --> 05:00:32,310
We can't cover it, guys.

7591
05:00:32,810 --> 05:00:34,810
I don't have enough hard drive space to make a PNG.

7592
05:00:34,970 --> 05:00:35,310
Yeah.

7593
05:00:35,310 --> 05:00:37,250
I don't know how to open up PNG.

7594
05:00:45,310 --> 05:00:49,050
Oh my god, people are saying Tone actually looks depressed.

7595
05:00:50,350 --> 05:00:50,830
Bro.

7596
05:00:50,830 --> 05:00:51,310
No.

7597
05:00:52,250 --> 05:00:53,210
No, Tone.

7598
05:00:53,810 --> 05:00:56,710
You should have studied up other people, not just us.

7599
05:01:00,230 --> 05:01:09,030
It's funny, you think about like when you get really good at the game, you're like, oh, they don't like complain about like cheese or matchups or like they're like iron will.

7600
05:01:09,250 --> 05:01:14,330
And then you just watch high level people play each other and they're just like fucking dog shit.

7601
05:01:14,370 --> 05:01:15,450
Who plays like that?

7602
05:01:16,030 --> 05:01:18,090
Who fucking, who grabs there?

7603
05:01:18,810 --> 05:01:20,010
It's so funny.

7604
05:01:21,050 --> 05:01:22,350
You're like, they're just like us.

7605
05:01:22,570 --> 05:01:23,450
They're just like us.

7606
05:01:30,810 --> 05:01:31,870
I don't know where it is.

7607
05:01:31,910 --> 05:01:32,970
Oh, yeah, we're waiting for our coaches.

7608
05:01:34,970 --> 05:01:36,150
Oh, this is cute.

7609
05:01:37,190 --> 05:01:38,410
This is cute art.

7610
05:01:42,870 --> 05:01:43,350
It's...

7611
05:01:44,690 --> 05:01:45,530
Three kings.

7612
05:01:49,110 --> 05:01:50,170
Oh my God, guys.

7613
05:01:50,530 --> 05:01:51,370
It's time.

7614
05:01:52,230 --> 05:01:53,230
The finals!

7615
05:01:53,550 --> 05:01:54,830
We made it!

7616
05:01:56,430 --> 05:01:57,990
Doesn't matter what happens.

7617
05:01:58,170 --> 05:01:59,310
We made it, guys.

7618
05:01:59,590 --> 05:02:01,110
We made it to the finals.

7619
05:02:01,290 --> 05:02:02,830
And that's all that matters.

7620
05:02:05,350 --> 05:02:09,250
No matter what, chat, everybody will remember us.

7621
05:02:12,970 --> 05:02:13,710
We will.

7622
05:02:13,830 --> 05:02:17,990
If we don't win, we gaslight all the fans into thinking we won.

7623
05:02:18,210 --> 05:02:19,090
And that's it.

7624
05:02:19,110 --> 05:02:19,410
That's all that.

7625
05:02:19,470 --> 05:02:20,250
I thought they...

7626
05:02:20,250 --> 05:02:21,870
I thought this team won last time.

7627
05:02:22,070 --> 05:02:23,970
I actually just thought this team won last time.

7628
05:02:24,190 --> 05:02:25,990
So, like, the gaslighting worked.

7629
05:02:26,110 --> 05:02:26,930
We can do it again.

7630
05:02:27,230 --> 05:02:29,150
Because I'm a professional at this.

7631
05:02:29,490 --> 05:02:29,970
I...

7632
05:02:34,370 --> 05:02:34,990
Don't worry.

7633
05:02:35,530 --> 05:02:37,830
If we don't win, we won.

7634
05:02:37,970 --> 05:02:41,330
Guys, remember, no matter what, we won the finals.

7635
05:02:41,790 --> 05:02:42,630
Okay, guys?

7636
05:02:43,230 --> 05:02:44,610
Always remember that.

7637
05:02:44,970 --> 05:02:46,350
We won the finals.

7638
05:02:55,050 --> 05:02:55,830
It's forgotten.

7639
05:03:02,720 --> 05:03:04,680
Well, well, well, well, well, well, well.

7640
05:03:07,580 --> 05:03:08,920
I'm not that nervous, though.

7641
05:03:09,000 --> 05:03:10,200
Because, like, I know my place.

7642
05:03:10,700 --> 05:03:11,700
How does she do it?

7643
05:03:11,720 --> 05:03:12,260
Guys, I can't...

7644
05:03:12,260 --> 05:03:13,240
Guys, we did it!

7645
05:03:13,340 --> 05:03:14,120
We won the tournament!

7646
05:03:15,180 --> 05:03:15,580
Guys!

7647
05:03:17,340 --> 05:03:18,360
We did it!

7648
05:03:19,280 --> 05:03:20,980
Okay, let's practice that, chat.

7649
05:03:21,140 --> 05:03:21,900
We gotta practice.

7650
05:03:22,000 --> 05:03:22,240
Okay.

7651
05:03:22,340 --> 05:03:28,160
When we... Obviously, no matter what, when we win, how are you guys gonna react, guys?

7652
05:03:33,040 --> 05:03:34,800
Oh my god, guys!

7653
05:03:35,080 --> 05:03:36,080
We did it!

7654
05:03:38,740 --> 05:03:39,260
Yeah!

7655
05:03:40,360 --> 05:03:42,120
Yeah, we gotta practice our celebration.

7656
05:03:42,380 --> 05:03:44,480
Because we're gonna celebrate winning.

7657
05:03:44,580 --> 05:03:46,080
No matter what happens, chat.

7658
05:03:46,640 --> 05:03:47,500
We won?

7659
05:03:47,600 --> 05:03:48,420
No way!

7660
05:03:50,080 --> 05:03:51,020
Reaction practice.

7661
05:03:51,600 --> 05:03:53,240
Guys, I need you guys to be more hype.

7662
05:03:53,600 --> 05:03:55,980
I need you guys to rewrite history for me.

7663
05:03:56,180 --> 05:03:56,660
Chat.

7664
05:03:56,780 --> 05:03:59,520
How are you gonna rewrite history if you're not as hype?

7665
05:04:03,700 --> 05:04:04,820
How are you gonna rewrite history if you're not as hype?

7666
05:04:09,600 --> 05:04:10,380
Let's go!

7667
05:04:12,340 --> 05:04:13,060
Let's go!

7668
05:04:13,420 --> 05:04:13,900
Let's go!

7669
05:04:13,900 --> 05:04:14,400
We're just waiting.

7670
05:04:14,620 --> 05:04:15,160
We're just waiting.

7671
05:04:15,160 --> 05:04:16,140
We're waiting on...

7672
05:04:16,140 --> 05:04:17,620
We're waiting on...

7673
05:04:18,760 --> 05:04:21,620
our coaches to come back to us.

7674
05:04:21,900 --> 05:04:22,720
to us.

7675
05:04:23,420 --> 05:04:24,160
Um...

7676
05:04:25,640 --> 05:04:26,380
And...

7677
05:04:26,380 --> 05:04:28,100
And then we can start.

7678
05:04:29,040 --> 05:04:29,780
Yay!

7679
05:04:31,260 --> 05:04:33,000
That's all we need to do.

7680
05:04:37,360 --> 05:04:41,720
We just need to wait for our coaches to come back to us.

7681
05:04:42,880 --> 05:04:43,620
Yay!

7682
05:04:56,190 --> 05:04:57,170
Doki's tired.

7683
05:04:57,390 --> 05:04:58,690
Guys, it's been five hours.

7684
05:04:59,130 --> 05:05:01,490
We've been techening.

7685
05:05:01,690 --> 05:05:04,230
Whoa, we've been techening for five hours.

7686
05:05:05,130 --> 05:05:05,750
Alright, alright.

7687
05:05:08,210 --> 05:05:08,830
Yay!

7688
05:05:12,170 --> 05:05:13,810
When are we starting?

7689
05:05:14,610 --> 05:05:17,530
They're having some giveaways before they get started.

7690
05:05:17,830 --> 05:05:20,470
Oh, so they're still doing the giveaway stuff.

7691
05:05:23,090 --> 05:05:26,190
My chat's practicing on celebrating no matter what.

7692
05:05:27,330 --> 05:05:27,990
That's good.

7693
05:05:28,110 --> 05:05:28,730
Good community.

7694
05:05:29,830 --> 05:05:33,830
They're gonna... if we lose, they're gonna make sure everybody knows we won.

7695
05:05:34,890 --> 05:05:36,310
If we lose, we win.

7696
05:05:36,430 --> 05:05:37,190
If we win, we win.

7697
05:05:37,310 --> 05:05:39,310
It's literally impossible, so...

7698
05:05:39,310 --> 05:05:40,750
Let's just finish up.

7699
05:05:41,870 --> 05:05:42,410
Yeah!

7700
05:06:11,730 --> 05:06:12,790
I'm so happy.

7701
05:06:13,030 --> 05:06:14,250
I'm like, relaxed.

7702
05:06:14,650 --> 05:06:16,110
I'm not nervous at all anymore.

7703
05:06:16,290 --> 05:06:17,630
I'm just relaxed and chill.

7704
05:06:17,650 --> 05:06:17,870
Now.

7705
05:06:20,190 --> 05:06:22,490
I got what we wanted.

7706
05:06:23,350 --> 05:06:24,730
We made it so far.

7707
05:06:25,150 --> 05:06:27,270
So I'm not as... I'm not nervous anymore.

7708
05:06:27,590 --> 05:06:29,550
I'm just here to vibe with my team.

7709
05:06:30,810 --> 05:06:31,990
I'm just happy!

7710
05:06:32,930 --> 05:06:33,570
Yippee!

7711
05:06:34,770 --> 05:06:36,070
And a little eepy.

7712
05:06:36,230 --> 05:06:36,530
I am.

7713
05:06:37,890 --> 05:06:39,850
I said I'll...

7714
05:06:39,850 --> 05:06:41,190
She wants something.

7715
05:06:41,550 --> 05:06:43,690
I said she can have my Chipotle code.

7716
05:06:45,550 --> 05:06:49,490
What if she's like... what if she's manipulating you?

7717
05:06:50,330 --> 05:06:51,310
She's tricking you!

7718
05:06:52,210 --> 05:06:52,610
No.

7719
05:06:52,610 --> 05:06:53,790
I'm too smart for that.

7720
05:06:54,670 --> 05:06:55,070
Okay.

7721
05:06:58,130 --> 05:07:00,010
We gotta get a final answer soon.

7722
05:07:00,090 --> 05:07:01,090
We're gonna get an answer soon.

7723
05:07:01,410 --> 05:07:03,190
We can see it based on how she plays.

7724
05:07:03,190 --> 05:07:03,870
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

7725
05:07:04,050 --> 05:07:05,630
She gotta make it look real though.

7726
05:07:06,050 --> 05:07:06,890
Yeah, make it look real.

7727
05:07:07,010 --> 05:07:08,450
Like how I'll make my loss look real.

7728
05:07:08,490 --> 05:07:09,170
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

7729
05:07:09,270 --> 05:07:10,650
She's gotta make it look real.

7730
05:07:12,250 --> 05:07:15,570
Like, if she starts beating shit out of me, then take that code back.

7731
05:07:17,850 --> 05:07:20,010
And the world will know she's a liar.

7732
05:07:22,390 --> 05:07:24,570
That she wouldn't match fixeress.

7733
05:07:24,650 --> 05:07:25,250
How could she?

7734
05:07:30,620 --> 05:07:32,080
What does heated tone say?

7735
05:07:34,000 --> 05:07:35,160
GG's I hate you.

7736
05:07:38,500 --> 05:07:40,120
Sorry tone, listen man.

7737
05:07:40,780 --> 05:07:41,760
GG's I hate you.

7738
05:07:44,420 --> 05:07:44,960
Listen.

7739
05:07:45,800 --> 05:07:48,540
Yo, look at my chat Matt, if you see it.

7740
05:07:48,980 --> 05:07:50,860
I'm sure she'll stream open.

7741
05:07:53,440 --> 05:07:53,960
Ha!

7742
05:07:57,720 --> 05:08:00,080
Sorry, there was a copy pasta, bro.

7743
05:08:00,480 --> 05:08:01,880
Hold that tone.

7744
05:08:02,120 --> 05:08:02,980
I'll see you at EVA.

7745
05:08:09,130 --> 05:08:10,950
Do the giveaway faster.

7746
05:08:14,410 --> 05:08:15,550
Matt, your ass.

7747
05:08:15,830 --> 05:08:17,670
I didn't drop a single game.

7748
05:08:20,450 --> 05:08:21,910
Where is he typing this?

7749
05:08:21,910 --> 05:08:23,010
He's already rewriting history.

7750
05:08:23,530 --> 05:08:24,210
Do I read your chat?

7751
05:08:24,250 --> 05:08:27,950
He said, Matt, your ass.

7752
05:08:28,010 --> 05:08:29,010
Bro pro, you're carried.

7753
05:08:29,250 --> 05:08:29,610
Damn.

7754
05:08:32,590 --> 05:08:32,950
Damn.

7755
05:08:33,650 --> 05:08:35,030
Can your lips say that to you?

7756
05:08:35,390 --> 05:08:35,830
It's okay.

7757
05:08:37,030 --> 05:08:39,190
I just, I can't hear you all the way down there at third.

7758
05:08:50,810 --> 05:08:52,370
I hope you have to edit for six days.

7759
05:08:52,430 --> 05:08:53,990
Nope, I am taking a break.

7760
05:08:54,710 --> 05:08:55,070
I...

7761
05:08:56,070 --> 05:08:57,570
Where's the lobby?

7762
05:08:57,910 --> 05:08:58,830
Whose lobby is it?

7763
05:08:59,830 --> 05:09:00,930
It's in stage one.

7764
05:09:01,370 --> 05:09:02,470
Phoebe posted it.

7765
05:09:03,190 --> 05:09:03,910
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

7766
05:09:05,230 --> 05:09:06,830
Wait, he posted that a while ago.

7767
05:09:07,090 --> 05:09:08,090
I'm not in there yet.

7768
05:09:08,370 --> 05:09:09,390
Yeah, I didn't ready up.

7769
05:09:09,450 --> 05:09:10,170
Don't worry, coach.

7770
05:09:10,450 --> 05:09:12,090
I'm keeping them hostage for you.

7771
05:09:12,590 --> 05:09:13,430
Let's get it, team.

7772
05:09:15,110 --> 05:09:18,630
If you win and it seems obvious, I will throw.

7773
05:09:18,790 --> 05:09:20,490
But if it seems like... No!

7774
05:09:20,510 --> 05:09:21,170
What the fuck?

7775
05:09:23,170 --> 05:09:24,710
Shut up, shut up, shut up.

7776
05:09:26,290 --> 05:09:26,730
Shit.

7777
05:09:27,390 --> 05:09:29,150
We got second last time, bro.

7778
05:09:29,230 --> 05:09:30,150
I'm not trying to lose again.

7779
05:09:30,850 --> 05:09:33,770
We're trying to get some match fixing going on here.

7780
05:09:34,670 --> 05:09:35,730
For the content.

7781
05:09:36,050 --> 05:09:36,990
Alright, I'm readied up.

7782
05:09:37,170 --> 05:09:39,330
I saw brah pro and I'm fucking in.

7783
05:09:40,370 --> 05:09:41,090
Yeah, I'm in there.

7784
05:09:41,150 --> 05:09:43,010
The content is my thumbnail that says that I won.

7785
05:09:43,110 --> 05:09:44,190
Don't fuck this up for me.

7786
05:09:45,070 --> 05:09:46,430
Get the fuck out of here.

7787
05:09:46,910 --> 05:09:48,630
You pre-made your...

7788
05:09:48,630 --> 05:09:50,830
You pre-made your thumbnail?

7789
05:09:51,050 --> 05:09:52,350
Yeah, I'm gonna have to pay for another thumbnail.

7790
05:09:52,350 --> 05:09:52,990
You gotta post that regardless.

7791
05:09:54,170 --> 05:09:55,170
I got money like that.

7792
05:09:55,270 --> 05:09:55,670
Come on.

7793
05:09:55,890 --> 05:09:58,430
Regardless of what happens, you gotta post that thumbnail.

7794
05:09:58,990 --> 05:10:00,290
I won, parentheses.

7795
05:10:00,670 --> 05:10:01,150
Kinda.

7796
05:10:02,490 --> 05:10:02,970
Almost.

7797
05:10:05,770 --> 05:10:07,830
I won, bracket baited.

7798
05:10:10,010 --> 05:10:11,130
On the thumbnail?

7799
05:10:11,350 --> 05:10:12,510
Like they didn't even click it yet?

7800
05:10:12,710 --> 05:10:14,130
Yeah, yeah, they didn't click.

7801
05:10:14,370 --> 05:10:14,990
Please click.

7802
05:10:15,050 --> 05:10:15,810
I won, I swear.

7803
05:10:16,010 --> 05:10:18,370
You couldn't... You wouldn't believe this, guys.

7804
05:10:18,630 --> 05:10:19,110
I won.

7805
05:10:21,250 --> 05:10:22,170
Alright, let's see.

7806
05:10:22,590 --> 05:10:23,530
Alright, let's see.

7807
05:10:23,590 --> 05:10:24,690
Let's see how she plays.

7808
05:10:25,350 --> 05:10:27,690
Coach, you never told me like how to...

7809
05:10:28,290 --> 05:10:29,810
like what to do about SK.

7810
05:10:29,970 --> 05:10:31,050
You never told me anything.

7811
05:10:31,450 --> 05:10:32,290
Just grip her up.

7812
05:10:32,730 --> 05:10:33,170
Really?

7813
05:10:33,630 --> 05:10:34,830
Oh my god, you're right!

7814
05:10:35,330 --> 05:10:36,430
Just grip her up.

7815
05:10:37,070 --> 05:10:37,990
She's scared, bro.

7816
05:10:38,010 --> 05:10:38,390
Just grab.

7817
05:10:39,130 --> 05:10:39,570
Oh!

7818
05:10:39,570 --> 05:10:40,710
Oh my god, you're right!

7819
05:10:41,330 --> 05:10:41,770
Yup.

7820
05:10:42,570 --> 05:10:43,010
Wait!

7821
05:10:43,650 --> 05:10:44,470
Is this true?

7822
05:10:45,730 --> 05:10:46,670
Oh my goodness.

7823
05:10:48,330 --> 05:10:48,990
Oh, what?

7824
05:10:49,070 --> 05:10:49,570
Maybe not.

7825
05:10:49,650 --> 05:10:50,190
Never mind.

7826
05:10:50,750 --> 05:10:51,490
Oh, what?

7827
05:10:51,490 --> 05:10:51,510
Maybe not.

7828
05:10:51,510 --> 05:10:51,510
Never mind.

7829
05:10:51,510 --> 05:10:52,250
Now you can just punch.

7830
05:10:53,130 --> 05:10:53,870
Maybe not.

7831
05:10:53,970 --> 05:10:54,490
Maybe not.

7832
05:10:56,710 --> 05:10:57,430
Let's go!

7833
05:10:57,890 --> 05:10:58,470
Let's go!

7834
05:11:00,010 --> 05:11:02,010
Oh my god, she's making it look real!

7835
05:11:05,250 --> 05:11:07,850
Oh wait, what the f- Oh, guys?

7836
05:11:08,830 --> 05:11:09,310
Guys?

7837
05:11:10,450 --> 05:11:12,250
Guys, she's not playing anymore.

7838
05:11:13,770 --> 05:11:15,310
She's like, Fuck it, I don't want this.

7839
05:11:15,590 --> 05:11:18,830
I hate that shit.

7840
05:11:19,930 --> 05:11:22,010
We were just fucking with you.

7841
05:11:22,770 --> 05:11:24,510
Oh my god, what a soul attack.

7842
05:11:25,310 --> 05:11:26,170
Oh my god.

7843
05:11:26,170 --> 05:11:28,190
We were just messing about.

7844
05:11:28,990 --> 05:11:29,510
Doki!

7845
05:11:29,510 --> 05:11:30,030
Doki!

7846
05:11:30,310 --> 05:11:30,830
Wait!

7847
05:11:31,430 --> 05:11:33,750
Maybe she is making it look real!

7848
05:11:34,150 --> 05:11:35,970
She's making it look so real!

7849
05:11:36,910 --> 05:11:37,430
No!

7850
05:11:38,270 --> 05:11:39,190
The fix?

7851
05:11:39,370 --> 05:11:40,530
The fix is in?

7852
05:11:40,710 --> 05:11:41,550
Wait, is it true?

7853
05:11:41,550 --> 05:11:43,610
Bro, did you actually do it?

7854
05:11:43,610 --> 05:11:44,130
For us?

7855
05:11:44,310 --> 05:11:46,050
No, she's playing for real.

7856
05:11:46,230 --> 05:11:46,670
You got this.

7857
05:11:46,970 --> 05:11:47,370
Oh my goodness.

7858
05:11:47,510 --> 05:11:50,550
Are you sure?

7859
05:11:50,670 --> 05:11:52,230
I thought you were throwing to be honest.

7860
05:11:56,110 --> 05:11:57,850
Guys, I don't know what happened.

7861
05:11:57,910 --> 05:11:59,570
I don't know what to do when she does that.

7862
05:12:02,650 --> 05:12:03,550
Do that.

7863
05:12:04,930 --> 05:12:05,890
Holy shit.

7864
05:12:09,590 --> 05:12:10,070
Adlata.

7865
05:12:10,070 --> 05:12:11,590
She's so scared of you.

7866
05:12:11,690 --> 05:12:12,210
Why?

7867
05:12:13,150 --> 05:12:14,270
Because you're good!

7868
05:12:14,470 --> 05:12:15,370
You're fucking good!

7869
05:12:15,710 --> 05:12:16,250
Oh my.

7870
05:12:17,770 --> 05:12:18,410
Oh fuck.

7871
05:12:19,070 --> 05:12:20,850
Guys, guys.

7872
05:12:21,130 --> 05:12:21,890
Wait, do I hit that?

7873
05:12:22,050 --> 05:12:22,850
No way.

7874
05:12:22,890 --> 05:12:24,870
No fucking way!

7875
05:12:25,310 --> 05:12:27,630
No fucking way!

7876
05:12:28,710 --> 05:12:30,290
Can I get a yay in the chat?

7877
05:12:30,690 --> 05:12:31,330
Yay!

7878
05:12:31,910 --> 05:12:32,250
Yay!

7879
05:12:36,750 --> 05:12:38,530
What the fuck?

7880
05:12:40,070 --> 05:12:41,490
The ESAM Slayer is down!

7881
05:12:41,570 --> 05:12:42,230
Oh my god!

7882
05:12:43,270 --> 05:12:44,470
One more, one more, one more.

7883
05:12:44,590 --> 05:12:44,970
Let's get it.

7884
05:12:45,830 --> 05:12:46,890
It's okay, it's over.

7885
05:12:47,210 --> 05:12:47,830
We're done.

7886
05:12:47,890 --> 05:12:48,450
I'm the best in the tournament.

7887
05:12:49,510 --> 05:12:50,650
You're killing it.

7888
05:12:50,650 --> 05:12:51,630
One more, one more.

7889
05:12:52,850 --> 05:12:53,890
Just keep it up.

7890
05:12:53,930 --> 05:12:54,570
Keep it up.

7891
05:12:54,670 --> 05:12:56,070
Send that Chipotle code!

7892
05:12:57,150 --> 05:12:57,910
No ground taken.

7893
05:13:00,470 --> 05:13:01,050
Let's go.

7894
05:13:01,570 --> 05:13:03,510
It's time to send in that Chipotle code.

7895
05:13:04,090 --> 05:13:04,770
Thank you.

7896
05:13:13,200 --> 05:13:13,860
One more.

7897
05:13:13,860 --> 05:13:14,560
One more, one more.

7898
05:13:14,640 --> 05:13:16,440
I already got my one win.

7899
05:13:16,500 --> 05:13:17,460
I don't care anymore.

7900
05:13:17,820 --> 05:13:18,660
No, you care.

7901
05:13:18,700 --> 05:13:19,620
You care a lot.

7902
05:13:19,700 --> 05:13:20,780
You care a lot.

7903
05:13:22,200 --> 05:13:23,480
Wait, what's in it for me?

7904
05:13:24,680 --> 05:13:25,220
A win?

7905
05:13:27,520 --> 05:13:28,860
I got a set!

7906
05:13:29,540 --> 05:13:30,860
We're gonna fucking win!

7907
05:13:31,420 --> 05:13:32,860
But I got a set though!

7908
05:13:37,160 --> 05:13:39,820
I tried to do that thing you did, but it didn't work.

7909
05:13:41,380 --> 05:13:43,160
Guys, I think she like...

7910
05:13:43,860 --> 05:13:46,820
You only told her to do one set, and she wasn't...

7911
05:13:46,820 --> 05:13:49,300
Oh yeah, didn't you say throw a set?

7912
05:13:49,520 --> 05:13:49,960
Damn it.

7913
05:13:50,160 --> 05:13:51,480
God damn it!

7914
05:13:52,600 --> 05:13:53,160
Pro!

7915
05:13:53,320 --> 05:13:53,520
Pro!

7916
05:13:58,240 --> 05:14:00,240
You promised a whole set!

7917
05:14:03,440 --> 05:14:04,640
Oh, you're cooking.

7918
05:14:05,380 --> 05:14:06,280
Am I?

7919
05:14:06,760 --> 05:14:08,860
Am I?

7920
05:14:08,940 --> 05:14:09,960
No fucking way!

7921
05:14:10,800 --> 05:14:12,080
Let's fucking go.

7922
05:14:13,860 --> 05:14:15,480
You're actually a better player!

7923
05:14:15,660 --> 05:14:16,320
Am I?

7924
05:14:16,960 --> 05:14:18,600
Yes, you are.

7925
05:14:21,360 --> 05:14:22,620
She's so scared, Doki.

7926
05:14:23,240 --> 05:14:25,440
Dude, Josh is in the living room.

7927
05:14:25,540 --> 05:14:26,820
He just said, let's go Doki.

7928
05:14:27,160 --> 05:14:28,360
Oh, yay!

7929
05:14:30,340 --> 05:14:31,300
Let's go Doki!

7930
05:14:31,780 --> 05:14:33,640
SK, please, the content would be so funny!

7931
05:14:34,060 --> 05:14:34,800
It really would!

7932
05:14:35,340 --> 05:14:36,560
It would be so good!

7933
05:14:36,680 --> 05:14:37,940
SK, just think about it!

7934
05:14:39,680 --> 05:14:40,800
Oh my god, the mid.

7935
05:14:41,460 --> 05:14:42,760
Oh my god.

7936
05:14:44,080 --> 05:14:44,780
Oh shit!

7937
05:14:46,220 --> 05:14:47,480
There's no way!

7938
05:14:48,340 --> 05:14:48,420
Oh, no!

7939
05:14:50,400 --> 05:14:50,840
Nooooooo!

7940
05:14:51,700 --> 05:14:52,140
Ah!

7941
05:14:52,440 --> 05:14:52,820
Goodbye.

7942
05:14:53,580 --> 05:14:54,560
She's dead, right?

7943
05:14:54,660 --> 05:14:55,180
Pro, yeah.

7944
05:14:55,280 --> 05:14:55,740
I'm dead.

7945
05:14:55,840 --> 05:14:57,160
No, I'm 100% dead.

7946
05:14:57,300 --> 05:14:58,420
Hey, you had that, Doki.

7947
05:14:58,460 --> 05:15:00,540
That was all you.

7948
05:15:01,080 --> 05:15:01,840
Oh, you're alive!

7949
05:15:01,980 --> 05:15:02,340
No, wait!

7950
05:15:02,500 --> 05:15:02,880
No!

7951
05:15:05,140 --> 05:15:05,860
There was nothing.

7952
05:15:07,120 --> 05:15:08,260
Close them, close them.

7953
05:15:09,360 --> 05:15:09,800
Fight!

7954
05:15:11,460 --> 05:15:12,320
Oh, hello.

7955
05:15:13,320 --> 05:15:14,200
Oh, hello.

7956
05:15:16,460 --> 05:15:17,920
Oh, she ducks now!

7957
05:15:18,160 --> 05:15:18,980
That's fine, that's fine.

7958
05:15:19,100 --> 05:15:20,160
It's a running me now.

7959
05:15:20,420 --> 05:15:20,900
Okay.

7960
05:15:22,420 --> 05:15:22,900
Goodbye.

7961
05:15:25,020 --> 05:15:25,500
Okay.

7962
05:15:26,540 --> 05:15:27,020
Goodbye.

7963
05:15:27,420 --> 05:15:27,900
Goodbye.

7964
05:15:29,020 --> 05:15:29,340
Goodbye.

7965
05:15:29,640 --> 05:15:33,280
How do you get up?

7966
05:15:33,360 --> 05:15:34,260
How are you getting up?

7967
05:15:36,360 --> 05:15:36,840
Goodbye.

7968
05:15:36,840 --> 05:15:37,240
Goodbye.

7969
05:15:37,240 --> 05:15:37,520
Yes!

7970
05:15:37,520 --> 05:15:38,400
For one start.

7971
05:15:38,600 --> 05:15:39,380
Come on.

7972
05:15:39,440 --> 05:15:39,800
Yay!

7973
05:15:40,020 --> 05:15:41,760
Oh my, a Kolean hit.

7974
05:15:43,000 --> 05:15:43,480
No!

7975
05:15:43,940 --> 05:15:45,640
I forgot to do that mid thing.

7976
05:15:45,640 --> 05:15:46,380
It's cool, it's cool.

7977
05:15:46,580 --> 05:15:47,740
It's cool, you're cooking her.

7978
05:15:47,980 --> 05:15:48,520
Am I?

7979
05:15:49,180 --> 05:15:50,600
Yes, you are, yes.

7980
05:15:50,660 --> 05:15:51,700
You truly are.

7981
05:15:51,740 --> 05:15:52,400
The Doki!

7982
05:15:52,540 --> 05:15:57,000
Oh, that got her hit!

7983
05:15:57,000 --> 05:15:57,700
Oh, that got her hit!

7984
05:15:57,840 --> 05:15:58,560
Finish her!

7985
05:16:01,080 --> 05:16:03,020
I got a point!

7986
05:16:03,540 --> 05:16:04,980
Let's fucking go!

7987
05:16:05,400 --> 05:16:06,760
Let's go Doki!

7988
05:16:07,660 --> 05:16:08,460
Unbelievable.

7989
05:16:10,280 --> 05:16:11,720
Are you kidding me?

7990
05:16:11,940 --> 05:16:12,660
Yeah!

7991
05:16:13,200 --> 05:16:14,320
Oh, yeah!

7992
05:16:15,800 --> 05:16:16,920
Let's go!

7993
05:16:17,120 --> 05:16:17,860
Let's go Doki!

7994
05:16:17,900 --> 05:16:19,160
We did it!

7995
05:16:20,140 --> 05:16:21,860
The Alley Kicks!

7996
05:16:22,700 --> 05:16:23,980
Oh my god!

7997
05:16:23,980 --> 05:16:28,840
Since I beat SK and SK beat Xezeb, I'm better than Ezeb!

7998
05:16:29,120 --> 05:16:30,120
It's actually true.

7999
05:16:30,240 --> 05:16:30,900
It's actually true.

8000
05:16:31,100 --> 05:16:33,880
We call that the Armada number in Melee.

8001
05:16:37,340 --> 05:16:37,900
Yes!

8002
05:16:37,900 --> 05:16:38,700
We win these!

8003
05:16:38,780 --> 05:16:39,540
Holy shit.

8004
05:16:41,500 --> 05:16:43,200
That's actually insane.

8005
05:16:43,520 --> 05:16:44,380
That is actually...

8006
05:16:44,380 --> 05:16:46,720
I told you we don't need defense!

8007
05:16:48,620 --> 05:16:50,100
I told you we don't need defense!

8008
05:16:50,260 --> 05:16:51,400
I can't believe it.

8009
05:16:51,520 --> 05:16:51,600
I can't believe it.

8010
05:17:00,780 --> 05:17:01,900
Do we have any defense?

8011
05:17:02,860 --> 05:17:03,340
No.

8012
05:17:05,120 --> 05:17:06,080
We don't.

8013
05:17:06,080 --> 05:17:06,220
No?

8014
05:17:06,460 --> 05:17:06,520
I'm active!

8015
05:17:12,430 --> 05:17:12,590
Yes yes.

8016
05:17:12,590 --> 05:17:17,510
Oh, yes!

8017
05:17:17,590 --> 05:17:24,170
The Damn Ice Freeze.

8018
05:17:24,170 --> 05:17:24,970
That's my goat.

8019
05:17:25,050 --> 05:17:25,690
That's my goat.

8020
05:17:26,450 --> 05:17:27,290
That's my goat.

8021
05:17:27,690 --> 05:17:29,470
Oh my god, he almost did a combo.

8022
05:17:34,380 --> 05:17:35,240
Nice dude.

8023
05:17:35,680 --> 05:17:36,400
Oh my god.

8024
05:17:42,590 --> 05:17:44,030
Oh my god.

8025
05:17:45,710 --> 05:17:46,250
Nice.

8026
05:17:46,990 --> 05:17:47,530
Nice!

8027
05:17:50,470 --> 05:17:51,330
King sweet!

8028
05:17:51,550 --> 05:17:52,130
King sweet!

8029
05:17:54,390 --> 05:17:54,930
Nice.

8030
05:17:54,990 --> 05:17:55,610
Good shit.

8031
05:17:55,850 --> 05:17:56,670
That was good.

8032
05:18:02,480 --> 05:18:03,540
Oh my nesto.

8033
05:18:03,700 --> 05:18:04,800
What a duck, Kony.

8034
05:18:05,940 --> 05:18:06,420
Nice.

8035
05:18:15,550 --> 05:18:16,670
Don't hold forward after that.

8036
05:18:16,910 --> 05:18:17,370
No.

8037
05:18:18,670 --> 05:18:19,550
Oh shit.

8038
05:18:19,870 --> 05:18:20,610
She doesn't know.

8039
05:18:23,690 --> 05:18:25,850
That's a failure of these by the way.

8040
05:18:26,210 --> 05:18:27,610
What the fuck?

8041
05:18:27,750 --> 05:18:29,670
You didn't teach that on you buddy.

8042
05:18:29,810 --> 05:18:30,670
That's on you buddy.

8043
05:18:31,230 --> 05:18:34,290
We got three king players and you didn't teach them how to get up properly?

8044
05:18:38,510 --> 05:18:38,990
Nice.

8045
05:18:41,470 --> 05:18:42,190
Freaky king.

8046
05:18:42,350 --> 05:18:42,890
Freaky king!

8047
05:18:45,630 --> 05:18:46,550
Oh my god.

8048
05:18:46,550 --> 05:18:46,930
That's crazy.

8049
05:18:49,730 --> 05:18:50,210
Yes!

8050
05:18:50,310 --> 05:18:50,790
Here we go.

8051
05:18:55,330 --> 05:18:55,810
Oh!

8052
05:18:55,950 --> 05:18:56,650
Good shit!

8053
05:18:56,810 --> 05:18:57,710
I tried to alley kick.

8054
05:18:57,890 --> 05:18:58,270
That was good.

8055
05:18:58,350 --> 05:18:59,210
That was good.

8056
05:18:59,350 --> 05:18:59,510
Yeah.

8057
05:18:59,670 --> 05:19:00,150
That was good.

8058
05:19:01,130 --> 05:19:02,050
Strong player.

8059
05:19:03,190 --> 05:19:04,650
This is truly finals.

8060
05:19:05,030 --> 05:19:05,510
Fight!

8061
05:19:07,110 --> 05:19:07,450
Got it bro.

8062
05:19:08,670 --> 05:19:09,710
Yeah she saw it.

8063
05:19:11,430 --> 05:19:11,830
Nice.

8064
05:19:11,990 --> 05:19:12,550
Good mid.

8065
05:19:13,230 --> 05:19:13,630
Okay.

8066
05:19:14,650 --> 05:19:15,050
Alright.

8067
05:19:15,110 --> 05:19:15,730
Lock in.

8068
05:19:15,750 --> 05:19:16,610
She's in my head.

8069
05:19:16,690 --> 05:19:17,750
Oh my god.

8070
05:19:18,850 --> 05:19:19,450
She's exactly.

8071
05:19:19,570 --> 05:19:19,970
Alright.

8072
05:19:19,970 --> 05:19:20,190
Alright.

8073
05:19:20,230 --> 05:19:20,390
Alright.

8074
05:19:20,450 --> 05:19:21,110
I gotta lock in.

8075
05:19:21,230 --> 05:19:22,410
She's kinda killing it now.

8076
05:19:22,510 --> 05:19:22,750
Okay.

8077
05:19:22,750 --> 05:19:23,130
Okay.

8078
05:19:23,430 --> 05:19:24,850
That's why I'm making it close.

8079
05:19:24,910 --> 05:19:25,450
Making it close.

8080
05:19:27,010 --> 05:19:27,810
Good low.

8081
05:19:36,650 --> 05:19:37,970
She's gonna get up correctly now.

8082
05:19:37,970 --> 05:19:38,630
They're live coaching.

8083
05:19:38,670 --> 05:19:38,850
Yeah.

8084
05:19:38,850 --> 05:19:38,930
Yeah.

8085
05:19:38,930 --> 05:19:39,070
Yeah.

8086
05:19:39,070 --> 05:19:39,170
No.

8087
05:19:39,250 --> 05:19:39,550
You're right.

8088
05:19:39,590 --> 05:19:39,910
You're right.

8089
05:19:40,010 --> 05:19:40,450
I'm live coaching.

8090
05:19:42,230 --> 05:19:42,630
Yeah.

8091
05:19:42,730 --> 05:19:43,650
So hit the alley kick after.

8092
05:19:43,890 --> 05:19:44,290
Yeah.

8093
05:19:44,370 --> 05:19:44,990
Oh my goodness.

8094
05:19:45,090 --> 05:19:45,650
He's dead.

8095
05:19:45,750 --> 05:19:46,330
That's counter hits.

8096
05:19:46,470 --> 05:19:47,110
Is he alive?

8097
05:19:47,910 --> 05:19:48,310
Nice.

8098
05:19:48,730 --> 05:19:49,070
Nice.

8099
05:19:49,070 --> 05:19:49,390
Nice.

8100
05:19:49,390 --> 05:19:49,690
Nice.

8101
05:19:49,770 --> 05:19:50,170
Yes!

8102
05:19:50,290 --> 05:19:50,690
Yes!

8103
05:19:50,690 --> 05:19:51,010
Yes!

8104
05:19:51,070 --> 05:19:51,910
Go Coyne!

8105
05:19:51,910 --> 05:19:52,410
Go Coyne!

8106
05:19:52,490 --> 05:19:52,590
Go!

8107
05:19:53,410 --> 05:19:53,810
Nice.

8108
05:19:55,490 --> 05:19:57,970
What is that?

8109
05:19:58,890 --> 05:19:59,590
What is that?

8110
05:19:59,890 --> 05:20:00,550
He lost bro!

8111
05:20:00,770 --> 05:20:01,590
That's Stone Cold!

8112
05:20:01,970 --> 05:20:02,990
That's Stone Cold?

8113
05:20:03,330 --> 05:20:04,710
It's cold like Sajan.

8114
05:20:04,710 --> 05:20:04,850
That's what Sajan is.

8115
05:20:06,090 --> 05:20:06,790
It's Slam Truth!

8116
05:20:07,350 --> 05:20:09,490
That's Stone Cold Steve Austin bro!

8117
05:20:16,040 --> 05:20:19,040
Looks like he has like a fucking pimple on his head.

8118
05:20:19,540 --> 05:20:21,460
The Looney Tunes injury.

8119
05:20:21,900 --> 05:20:22,540
The anvil.

8120
05:20:25,500 --> 05:20:28,200
Y'all don't know about Coyne's PM Wario dude.

8121
05:20:28,200 --> 05:20:29,220
Get ready for the next battle.

8122
05:20:29,540 --> 05:20:30,700
Oh PM Wario.

8123
05:20:30,720 --> 05:20:31,640
Yeah we got Wario here.

8124
05:20:31,800 --> 05:20:32,000
Yeah.

8125
05:20:32,900 --> 05:20:34,100
PM Wario bro.

8126
05:20:34,300 --> 05:20:34,640
Wah.

8127
05:20:35,300 --> 05:20:35,840
Wah.

8128
05:20:41,210 --> 05:20:41,750
Okay.

8129
05:20:43,250 --> 05:20:43,790
Okay.

8130
05:20:43,790 --> 05:20:44,310
Lock in brother.

8131
05:20:45,270 --> 05:20:45,810
Again!

8132
05:20:48,710 --> 05:20:50,030
She needs to do a crowd.

8133
05:20:50,230 --> 05:20:51,290
She got a death.

8134
05:20:51,430 --> 05:20:51,690
Wario!

8135
05:20:54,570 --> 05:20:55,110
Wario!

8136
05:20:56,030 --> 05:20:56,550
Wario!

8137
05:20:59,260 --> 05:20:59,800
Oh!

8138
05:21:03,120 --> 05:21:04,440
Okay she's waiting now.

8139
05:21:04,540 --> 05:21:05,440
Which means...

8140
05:21:06,040 --> 05:21:06,740
Love battle.

8141
05:21:07,740 --> 05:21:08,480
That's right.

8142
05:21:09,680 --> 05:21:10,180
That's what it takes brother.

8143
05:21:10,660 --> 05:21:12,200
Death by a mystery.

8144
05:21:13,520 --> 05:21:15,380
Give me your points!

8145
05:21:15,720 --> 05:21:16,300
Yes!

8146
05:21:17,280 --> 05:21:18,420
Sweep the team!

8147
05:21:18,920 --> 05:21:20,060
She's scared now.

8148
05:21:20,220 --> 05:21:21,100
Now we run up grab.

8149
05:21:21,760 --> 05:21:22,880
Oh my god.

8150
05:21:24,220 --> 05:21:25,320
She's so scared.

8151
05:21:25,360 --> 05:21:26,880
You're predicting her life!

8152
05:21:27,900 --> 05:21:28,360
Oh my fucking goodness.

8153
05:21:29,360 --> 05:21:29,960
Oh!

8154
05:21:29,960 --> 05:21:31,120
Counter hit everywhere.

8155
05:21:32,240 --> 05:21:33,800
Never let her get up!

8156
05:21:34,200 --> 05:21:35,560
Nice punish Cody!

8157
05:21:35,720 --> 05:21:36,420
That's a punish.

8158
05:21:36,520 --> 05:21:37,160
The one two.

8159
05:21:37,360 --> 05:21:38,460
That was a punish.

8160
05:21:38,460 --> 05:21:39,160
Now we fight.

8161
05:21:39,680 --> 05:21:39,680
Yeah!

8162
05:21:39,740 --> 05:21:40,600
Now we fight at the start.

8163
05:21:40,760 --> 05:21:41,220
I get it.

8164
05:21:41,260 --> 05:21:42,180
I know how this game works.

8165
05:21:42,380 --> 05:21:43,240
Now we fight.

8166
05:21:44,060 --> 05:21:44,960
He is unreal.

8167
05:21:46,360 --> 05:21:47,320
Who is he?

8168
05:21:49,580 --> 05:21:50,500
Starting to believe.

8169
05:21:50,560 --> 05:21:51,820
He moves like they do.

8170
05:21:53,100 --> 05:21:54,160
He's in her mind.

8171
05:21:54,340 --> 05:21:54,720
Good shit.

8172
05:21:54,780 --> 05:21:55,600
I hate this stage.

8173
05:21:57,120 --> 05:21:58,720
We just have to give her one you know.

8174
05:21:59,220 --> 05:21:59,900
Good mid.

8175
05:22:01,100 --> 05:22:03,680
Not these fuck... How many walls are in this fucking...

8176
05:22:04,760 --> 05:22:05,560
Holy shit!

8177
05:22:06,040 --> 05:22:06,640
It's like seven.

8178
05:22:08,020 --> 05:22:08,960
It's a temple.

8179
05:22:09,220 --> 05:22:09,700
It's okay.

8180
05:22:09,820 --> 05:22:11,220
Two of them are gone now.

8181
05:22:11,340 --> 05:22:12,120
So it's okay.

8182
05:22:13,980 --> 05:22:15,300
It's a bit bigger now.

8183
05:22:21,230 --> 05:22:21,710
Nice.

8184
05:22:21,850 --> 05:22:22,330
Nice.

8185
05:22:22,950 --> 05:22:23,550
We're good.

8186
05:22:23,670 --> 05:22:24,010
We're good.

8187
05:22:24,110 --> 05:22:24,630
It's fine.

8188
05:22:26,450 --> 05:22:27,430
Oh I pressed.

8189
05:22:27,770 --> 05:22:28,090
It's fine.

8190
05:22:28,850 --> 05:22:29,330
Okay.

8191
05:22:30,370 --> 05:22:30,970
It's fine.

8192
05:22:30,990 --> 05:22:31,250
It's fine.

8193
05:22:31,250 --> 05:22:31,690
Good adaptation.

8194
05:22:33,230 --> 05:22:33,710
Alright.

8195
05:22:33,890 --> 05:22:34,610
I know what to do.

8196
05:22:34,730 --> 05:22:35,570
I just stagger offense.

8197
05:22:36,630 --> 05:22:37,110
Nice.

8198
05:22:37,750 --> 05:22:38,190
Nice.

8199
05:22:38,430 --> 05:22:40,230
Oh my god.

8200
05:22:40,290 --> 05:22:41,610
Oh my god.

8201
05:22:42,090 --> 05:22:42,530
Oh!

8202
05:22:44,270 --> 05:22:45,390
What else my goat?

8203
05:22:46,050 --> 05:22:47,030
What else my goat?

8204
05:22:49,410 --> 05:22:50,910
You still have smash though.

8205
05:22:51,790 --> 05:22:52,530
That's a wincon.

8206
05:22:52,570 --> 05:22:54,010
And she's burning rage.

8207
05:22:54,090 --> 05:22:57,930
He had a lot of gray life though.

8208
05:22:58,010 --> 05:22:58,810
So it's gonna take that.

8209
05:22:58,930 --> 05:23:00,670
But other than that you don't have to worry about it.

8210
05:23:00,870 --> 05:23:01,170
Okay.

8211
05:23:06,130 --> 05:23:06,570
Yeah.

8212
05:23:06,630 --> 05:23:06,850
Yeah.

8213
05:23:06,890 --> 05:23:07,010
Yeah.

8214
05:23:07,130 --> 05:23:08,210
One more mix.

8215
05:23:08,270 --> 05:23:09,130
She was in the air.

8216
05:23:13,140 --> 05:23:13,580
Oh!

8217
05:23:13,960 --> 05:23:15,060
What a block by her.

8218
05:23:15,900 --> 05:23:16,980
Oh my god!

8219
05:23:17,900 --> 05:23:19,160
I got an alley kick!

8220
05:23:19,360 --> 05:23:20,640
I got an alley kick!

8221
05:23:20,740 --> 05:23:21,740
I got a down back three!

8222
05:23:22,140 --> 05:23:22,860
Nice try.

8223
05:23:22,980 --> 05:23:23,440
Nice try.

8224
05:23:23,540 --> 05:23:23,840
Nice try.

8225
05:23:23,920 --> 05:23:25,380
I gotta get off that stage.

8226
05:23:25,440 --> 05:23:26,380
I'm getting off there.

8227
05:23:27,380 --> 05:23:28,260
Very close.

8228
05:23:28,740 --> 05:23:29,540
It was close.

8229
05:23:29,720 --> 05:23:29,940
It was close.

8230
05:23:30,960 --> 05:23:32,260
She's playing a lot bro.

8231
05:23:32,340 --> 05:23:32,960
She got better.

8232
05:23:33,140 --> 05:23:33,580
Fuck.

8233
05:23:33,820 --> 05:23:34,040
Yeah.

8234
05:23:34,300 --> 05:23:34,740
100%.

8235
05:23:34,740 --> 05:23:35,120
Yeah.

8236
05:23:35,140 --> 05:23:36,240
She's playing county king.

8237
05:23:36,420 --> 05:23:37,580
I just gotta grab more.

8238
05:23:37,720 --> 05:23:38,660
I know the timing.

8239
05:23:39,220 --> 05:23:39,660
Yeah.

8240
05:23:39,840 --> 05:23:40,940
She doesn't tech.

8241
05:23:41,520 --> 05:23:42,780
She's barely been ducking either.

8242
05:23:43,000 --> 05:23:43,220
No.

8243
05:23:43,320 --> 05:23:43,540
Yeah.

8244
05:23:44,180 --> 05:23:45,020
I got it.

8245
05:23:45,320 --> 05:23:45,600
I got it.

8246
05:23:45,700 --> 05:23:49,980
You just wanted to be a pretty king for a third round.

8247
05:23:50,480 --> 05:23:52,860
I got a good stage here.

8248
05:23:53,900 --> 05:23:54,600
Let's get it.

8249
05:23:54,720 --> 05:23:55,580
Oh nice.

8250
05:23:56,720 --> 05:23:57,140
Okay.

8251
05:23:58,000 --> 05:23:58,780
Come on baby.

8252
05:23:58,940 --> 05:24:00,080
Is she scared at the start again?

8253
05:24:01,160 --> 05:24:01,980
That would be hilarious.

8254
05:24:01,980 --> 05:24:03,280
I could have just done the fucking pedigree again.

8255
05:24:09,010 --> 05:24:10,050
Drop his wallet.

8256
05:24:10,210 --> 05:24:10,650
That's okay.

8257
05:24:11,390 --> 05:24:12,690
Oh fuck man.

8258
05:24:12,690 --> 05:24:14,670
I didn't know it was that punishable.

8259
05:24:14,810 --> 05:24:15,290
No.

8260
05:24:16,670 --> 05:24:17,630
Nice dude.

8261
05:24:17,710 --> 05:24:18,830
That just locks me in.

8262
05:24:19,230 --> 05:24:19,870
It's okay.

8263
05:24:20,030 --> 05:24:20,110
It's okay.

8264
05:24:23,090 --> 05:24:23,570
Nice.

8265
05:24:23,650 --> 05:24:24,730
Nice hog kick bro.

8266
05:24:33,080 --> 05:24:33,960
Guaranteed at the wall.

8267
05:24:34,000 --> 05:24:34,220
Uh oh.

8268
05:24:35,280 --> 05:24:35,760
Wow.

8269
05:24:37,760 --> 05:24:39,140
What an alley kick.

8270
05:24:39,260 --> 05:24:39,580
Nice.

8271
05:24:40,020 --> 05:24:41,400
The fuck I'm talking about dude.

8272
05:24:41,520 --> 05:24:42,440
Three alley kicks.

8273
05:24:42,440 --> 05:24:43,420
Three kings.

8274
05:24:47,300 --> 05:24:47,940
Nice.

8275
05:24:48,760 --> 05:24:49,720
Good shit.

8276
05:24:49,860 --> 05:24:50,600
I tried to go low.

8277
05:24:55,000 --> 05:24:55,640
Wow.

8278
05:24:55,820 --> 05:24:56,520
That break.

8279
05:24:56,900 --> 05:24:57,940
Holy shit.

8280
05:24:58,720 --> 05:24:59,360
Okay.

8281
05:25:04,120 --> 05:25:05,400
Nice option.

8282
05:25:05,720 --> 05:25:06,340
She's anxious.

8283
05:25:08,120 --> 05:25:08,760
Nice.

8284
05:25:08,820 --> 05:25:09,340
Got up wrong.

8285
05:25:10,220 --> 05:25:10,960
More mix.

8286
05:25:10,980 --> 05:25:11,620
More grabs.

8287
05:25:12,600 --> 05:25:14,160
She got up way wrong.

8288
05:25:14,540 --> 05:25:15,820
You got up wrong dude.

8289
05:25:16,040 --> 05:25:16,180
Oh nice.

8290
05:25:16,180 --> 05:25:16,260
Nice.

8291
05:25:16,260 --> 05:25:16,400
Nice.

8292
05:25:16,420 --> 05:25:17,240
Oh.

8293
05:25:17,800 --> 05:25:18,700
End it.

8294
05:25:18,940 --> 05:25:19,660
End it.

8295
05:25:19,860 --> 05:25:21,580
Come on Kony.

8296
05:25:21,640 --> 05:25:22,360
You got this Kony.

8297
05:25:22,380 --> 05:25:23,660
Muscle Buster breaks the floor.

8298
05:25:23,980 --> 05:25:25,060
Lil B is watching.

8299
05:25:27,440 --> 05:25:28,540
Oh we fucked it up.

8300
05:25:28,580 --> 05:25:28,840
It's okay.

8301
05:25:29,740 --> 05:25:30,800
Oh my goodness.

8302
05:25:36,800 --> 05:25:37,280
Dude.

8303
05:25:37,840 --> 05:25:39,420
Oh my god.

8304
05:25:39,660 --> 05:25:40,220
Oh my god.

8305
05:25:40,560 --> 05:25:41,800
Hold on.

8306
05:25:41,860 --> 05:25:41,960
Hold on.

8307
05:25:42,080 --> 05:25:42,920
He's a bus ass.

8308
05:25:43,180 --> 05:25:43,900
He's a bus ass.

8309
05:25:45,820 --> 05:25:47,220
Oh he's fucking a muscle busker.

8310
05:25:47,220 --> 05:25:47,340
Fucking.

8311
05:25:49,640 --> 05:25:50,200
Nice!

8312
05:25:50,200 --> 05:25:50,680
End it!

8313
05:25:50,840 --> 05:25:51,580
End it!

8314
05:25:51,740 --> 05:25:52,360
Great game!

8315
05:25:53,080 --> 05:25:53,640
Explode!

8316
05:25:54,300 --> 05:25:54,860
Nice!

8317
05:25:56,820 --> 05:25:58,660
Oh, fuck yeah, man.

8318
05:25:59,220 --> 05:26:00,060
Cody wins!

8319
05:26:01,020 --> 05:26:02,200
Cody let's go!

8320
05:26:02,720 --> 05:26:04,880
She got very good.

8321
05:26:05,160 --> 05:26:05,900
King sweep!

8322
05:26:06,340 --> 05:26:07,980
She was playing really good.

8323
05:26:08,160 --> 05:26:10,820
Her composure has gotten so much better, dude.

8324
05:26:10,920 --> 05:26:15,940
I like... I kind of steamrolled her at certain points, but like, there were other times that she took the game back from me.

8325
05:26:16,400 --> 05:26:16,920
Phew!

8326
05:26:16,920 --> 05:26:17,500
That's crazy.

8327
05:26:18,920 --> 05:26:20,080
PDX, because I'm going to lose to FD.

8328
05:26:21,140 --> 05:26:21,940
Dude, relax.

8329
05:26:22,280 --> 05:26:23,100
You've got this.

8330
05:26:23,440 --> 05:26:23,920
Slime's turn.

8331
05:26:24,920 --> 05:26:26,380
Slime, you've got this!

8332
05:26:26,760 --> 05:26:28,820
You could just end it right now.

8333
05:26:28,940 --> 05:26:29,920
I could end it right now.

8334
05:26:37,300 --> 05:26:39,920
Do you want live coaching slime?

8335
05:26:40,340 --> 05:26:41,780
I mean, just tell me right now.

8336
05:26:42,000 --> 05:26:42,220
Yes.

8337
05:26:42,260 --> 05:26:43,660
Let's try it in the first game.

8338
05:26:43,740 --> 05:26:45,280
I think I know what I have to do.

8339
05:26:45,380 --> 05:26:46,860
Like taunts while rage-guarding.

8340
05:26:57,050 --> 05:26:57,830
I think I know what I have to do.

8341
05:26:57,830 --> 05:26:57,850
I think I know what I have to do.

8342
05:26:58,030 --> 05:27:00,190
Here we go.

8343
05:27:01,130 --> 05:27:02,350
What a day, man.

8344
05:27:03,270 --> 05:27:04,370
I know, dude.

8345
05:27:04,810 --> 05:27:07,770
I'm going to drink after this.

8346
05:27:07,890 --> 05:27:08,130
I'm going to drink after this.

8347
05:27:08,590 --> 05:27:10,750
I actually need to chill the brain.

8348
05:27:16,080 --> 05:27:16,600
Jesus.

8349
05:27:17,080 --> 05:27:18,380
Who needs defense?

8350
05:27:18,820 --> 05:27:22,080
I'm here to represent all the King players that don't block.

8351
05:27:22,800 --> 05:27:24,260
I'm here to represent all the King players that don't block.

8352
05:27:24,260 --> 05:27:25,000
She's a real one.

8353
05:27:26,380 --> 05:27:27,020
Alright, brother.

8354
05:27:39,490 --> 05:27:40,050
Let's go.

8355
05:27:42,310 --> 05:27:43,270
Round one.

8356
05:27:44,330 --> 05:27:44,810
Fight.

8357
05:27:48,110 --> 05:27:48,590
Six.

8358
05:27:48,850 --> 05:27:49,270
Nice.

8359
05:27:50,270 --> 05:27:51,410
Stay composed, slime.

8360
05:27:51,450 --> 05:27:52,250
You can do these combos.

8361
05:27:54,150 --> 05:27:55,270
What the fuck?

8362
05:27:55,270 --> 05:27:55,750
Good shit!

8363
05:28:01,740 --> 05:28:03,680
This guy's free to running 1 plus 2.

8364
05:28:03,720 --> 05:28:04,820
He doesn't do anything at that range.

8365
05:28:15,740 --> 05:28:16,540
Oh, nice!

8366
05:28:16,660 --> 05:28:19,340
Bro, slime, I'm going to tell you the truth, dude.

8367
05:28:19,440 --> 05:28:20,920
I think he knows he has to win.

8368
05:28:21,660 --> 05:28:22,380
He's food.

8369
05:28:22,500 --> 05:28:23,580
He's fucking food!

8370
05:28:23,900 --> 05:28:24,420
He's food!

8371
05:28:24,460 --> 05:28:29,380
He's going to be missing in the forest later.

8372
05:28:31,340 --> 05:28:32,260
He's so scared.

8373
05:28:32,500 --> 05:28:33,600
He doesn't want to lose it.

8374
05:28:35,800 --> 05:28:38,080
Yeah, he wants to put the pressure on the other guy.

8375
05:28:38,400 --> 05:28:39,180
That's right, slime.

8376
05:28:39,360 --> 05:28:40,200
Yes, slime!

8377
05:28:43,100 --> 05:28:44,240
Oh, my God!

8378
05:28:44,340 --> 05:28:44,680
Eat him!

8379
05:28:44,860 --> 05:28:45,260
Eat him!

8380
05:28:45,400 --> 05:28:46,300
Eat the bird, too!

8381
05:28:46,500 --> 05:28:47,740
Eat the fucking bird!

8382
05:28:48,160 --> 05:28:53,600
I thought this guy was nice, bro.

8383
05:28:53,700 --> 05:28:54,680
What the fuck?

8384
05:28:58,820 --> 05:29:00,080
We let him get one.

8385
05:29:00,740 --> 05:29:01,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

8386
05:29:03,640 --> 05:29:04,700
Damn, that's a lot, though.

8387
05:29:05,280 --> 05:29:06,480
That one is a lot.

8388
05:29:10,370 --> 05:29:10,790
Bro!

8389
05:29:10,870 --> 05:29:11,530
No, we ducked that one.

8390
05:29:11,670 --> 05:29:12,650
We ducked that, actually.

8391
05:29:12,790 --> 05:29:13,610
Oh, my God!

8392
05:29:14,370 --> 05:29:16,570
Oh, my God!

8393
05:29:16,830 --> 05:29:18,810
I think somebody really wants to win.

8394
05:29:19,610 --> 05:29:20,670
You have heat, slime.

8395
05:29:20,950 --> 05:29:22,010
Oh, big grab!

8396
05:29:22,910 --> 05:29:23,390
Dragon!

8397
05:29:24,230 --> 05:29:25,030
Dragon booty!

8398
05:29:31,130 --> 05:29:32,730
The fuck is that?

8399
05:29:32,930 --> 05:29:34,750
What the fuck is that?

8400
05:29:34,850 --> 05:29:36,030
I can't believe he didn't attend it.

8401
05:29:36,050 --> 05:29:36,730
That's actually crazy.

8402
05:29:38,390 --> 05:29:39,610
He's desperate as fuck.

8403
05:29:41,350 --> 05:29:42,710
He's so desperate, slime.

8404
05:29:45,070 --> 05:29:46,890
Give us that lag coaching, bro!

8405
05:29:48,570 --> 05:29:50,410
He's gonna shoulder you every time you do back one.

8406
05:29:50,470 --> 05:29:50,950
You have to stop.

8407
05:29:53,870 --> 05:29:55,170
Unless you think he's gonna hit you.

8408
05:29:55,210 --> 05:29:57,770
Unless you think he's gonna pressure you, then you have to do it.

8409
05:29:57,850 --> 05:29:59,090
But he has the punish.

8410
05:29:59,530 --> 05:29:59,890
Jesus!

8411
05:30:01,970 --> 05:30:03,750
Yeah, back one as long as you don't think he's gonna block.

8412
05:30:13,050 --> 05:30:13,410
Nice.

8413
05:30:17,450 --> 05:30:18,370
Oh, that lag stack.

8414
05:30:19,310 --> 05:30:20,050
That's a wall combo.

8415
05:30:21,350 --> 05:30:21,710
Nice!

8416
05:30:21,710 --> 05:30:21,990
Nice!

8417
05:30:22,770 --> 05:30:23,830
Oh my god.

8418
05:30:24,770 --> 05:30:25,890
Get off the ground!

8419
05:30:26,770 --> 05:30:27,290
Fish!

8420
05:30:28,450 --> 05:30:28,970
Mix!

8421
05:30:29,410 --> 05:30:29,690
Mix!

8422
05:30:29,690 --> 05:30:29,890
Mix!

8423
05:30:30,070 --> 05:30:30,330
Oh!

8424
05:30:33,970 --> 05:30:34,490
That's...

8425
05:30:40,280 --> 05:30:40,880
Rage art!

8426
05:30:40,980 --> 05:30:41,180
Rage art!

8427
05:30:41,280 --> 05:30:41,440
Aww.

8428
05:30:44,100 --> 05:30:45,240
That's gonna kill you.

8429
05:30:45,900 --> 05:30:47,340
Aww, it's so close.

8430
05:30:47,860 --> 05:30:54,100
In that situation, the hunting bear stance 1 plus 2 would have worked where you were in hunting and you could have just back off.

8431
05:30:54,460 --> 05:30:55,400
It would have worked.

8432
05:30:57,260 --> 05:30:58,880
And if you did your wall...

8433
05:30:58,880 --> 05:31:01,220
When I said wall combo, you did the wall combo there.

8434
05:31:01,380 --> 05:31:02,280
I mean, he was dead.

8435
05:31:03,380 --> 05:31:06,600
Yeah, I thought I couldn't because I blew my like...

8436
05:31:06,600 --> 05:31:08,220
I thought I blew something.

8437
05:31:08,460 --> 05:31:11,280
You did your heat burst, but that's fine.

8438
05:31:11,860 --> 05:31:12,720
Yeah, you can still do it.

8439
05:31:12,960 --> 05:31:17,580
And also, when you got a wall spike, you did G clef and then you tried to do the back 3 plus 4.

8440
05:31:17,720 --> 05:31:19,860
That's not gonna work because G clef counts as a tornado.

8441
05:31:19,860 --> 05:31:20,520
I'm using my tornado, yeah.

8442
05:31:21,320 --> 05:31:22,580
So if you G clef...

8443
05:31:23,940 --> 05:31:24,980
Yeah, it's just one set.

8444
05:31:25,100 --> 05:31:27,280
Then you can do down back 1 plus 2 spam.

8445
05:31:27,920 --> 05:31:28,320
Okay.

8446
05:31:28,940 --> 05:31:30,820
That will work after that as a wall combo.

8447
05:31:32,200 --> 05:31:33,100
You got this, dude.

8448
05:31:33,260 --> 05:31:34,400
You already know what to do.

8449
05:31:37,200 --> 05:31:40,440
Also, when you get mid range, he's free to wall running 1 plus 2.

8450
05:31:41,500 --> 05:31:41,900
Fight!

8451
05:31:46,860 --> 05:31:47,800
Where's Hopkick's at?

8452
05:31:48,440 --> 05:31:48,840
Yeah!

8453
05:31:49,720 --> 05:31:50,120
Yeah!

8454
05:31:56,400 --> 05:31:56,800
Ha!

8455
05:32:02,700 --> 05:32:03,180
Stop.

8456
05:32:04,080 --> 05:32:04,560
Stop.

8457
05:32:05,260 --> 05:32:05,580
Stop.

8458
05:32:07,920 --> 05:32:09,040
That's crazy, man.

8459
05:32:09,300 --> 05:32:10,660
I can't believe that's 3 steps.

8460
05:32:11,200 --> 05:32:11,680
That's crazy.

8461
05:32:12,180 --> 05:32:13,240
You got this, dude.

8462
05:32:13,380 --> 05:32:15,940
Yeah, only back 1 for the moves.

8463
05:32:16,440 --> 05:32:16,620
Yeah, only back 1 for the moves.

8464
05:32:17,220 --> 05:32:17,700
Nice!

8465
05:32:19,980 --> 05:32:20,820
Good shit!

8466
05:32:21,380 --> 05:32:22,300
Back 2-2-1!

8467
05:32:22,800 --> 05:32:24,540
And then do it again after the tornado.

8468
05:32:25,680 --> 05:32:26,480
That's fine too.

8469
05:32:27,200 --> 05:32:27,940
Yeah, whatever.

8470
05:32:30,900 --> 05:32:31,620
Right there.

8471
05:32:37,160 --> 05:32:37,920
Nice slime.

8472
05:32:38,480 --> 05:32:38,960
Nice!

8473
05:32:40,240 --> 05:32:41,700
You can back to one.

8474
05:32:43,740 --> 05:32:44,960
Up forward to Rayshard.

8475
05:32:45,120 --> 05:32:45,960
Up forward to Rayshard.

8476
05:32:54,270 --> 05:32:54,750
Nice!

8477
05:32:56,830 --> 05:32:57,310
Nice!

8478
05:32:57,430 --> 05:32:57,950
Good shit!

8479
05:32:57,950 --> 05:32:58,230
Oh!

8480
05:33:07,040 --> 05:33:07,480
Nice.

8481
05:33:07,520 --> 05:33:07,780
Beautiful.

8482
05:33:28,360 --> 05:33:29,140
That's okay dude.

8483
05:33:29,300 --> 05:33:29,880
Just focus.

8484
05:33:30,000 --> 05:33:30,340
You got it.

8485
05:33:33,400 --> 05:33:35,220
I mean like... Good shit!

8486
05:33:35,560 --> 05:33:36,960
You are the bear player.

8487
05:33:37,760 --> 05:33:38,640
Nice slime!

8488
05:33:39,100 --> 05:33:39,540
We believe!

8489
05:33:40,080 --> 05:33:42,080
What the micro... I didn't mean to do that dude.

8490
05:33:42,160 --> 05:33:42,640
This lag sucks.

8491
05:33:43,420 --> 05:33:43,940
It's okay.

8492
05:33:44,020 --> 05:33:44,180
It's okay.

8493
05:33:56,340 --> 05:33:57,720
It's just so fucking laggy.

8494
05:33:57,740 --> 05:33:58,420
Yeah, team lag.

8495
05:33:58,500 --> 05:33:58,860
Team lag.

8496
05:33:59,040 --> 05:33:59,780
That's the joke of the game dude.

8497
05:34:01,040 --> 05:34:01,500
That's okay.

8498
05:34:01,640 --> 05:34:01,960
That's okay.

8499
05:34:02,780 --> 05:34:04,520
I'm about to fight FD on the microwave.

8500
05:34:05,080 --> 05:34:05,780
It's like why...

8501
05:34:07,880 --> 05:34:08,320
It's okay.

8502
05:34:08,420 --> 05:34:09,080
They just needed one.

8503
05:34:09,120 --> 05:34:09,600
They needed one.

8504
05:34:09,720 --> 05:34:10,040
It's okay.

8505
05:34:11,160 --> 05:34:12,880
MatPat is gonna fucking take it home.

8506
05:34:13,380 --> 05:34:13,820
For us.

8507
05:34:14,080 --> 05:34:16,280
Three straight would have been a little embarrassing for them.

8508
05:34:16,360 --> 05:34:17,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

8509
05:34:17,400 --> 05:34:18,020
That's true.

8510
05:34:22,380 --> 05:34:24,160
Save me 58 defense.

8511
05:34:24,900 --> 05:34:25,140
Save me.

8512
05:34:25,400 --> 05:34:27,400
Save me 58 defense Jack.

8513
05:34:27,720 --> 05:34:28,900
I will try dude.

8514
05:34:29,420 --> 05:34:30,280
Get his ass.

8515
05:34:30,600 --> 05:34:31,860
He's got three characters.

8516
05:34:32,040 --> 05:34:32,620
Well he's got two.

8517
05:34:32,700 --> 05:34:34,740
He's not gonna play Jack but... He's going Eddy brother.

8518
05:34:35,300 --> 05:34:35,740
Yeah.

8519
05:34:36,380 --> 05:34:37,300
I will try.

8520
05:34:37,400 --> 05:34:38,220
I don't know bro.

8521
05:34:38,440 --> 05:34:39,840
Just get ready to play Fee Fee Fee.

8522
05:34:39,940 --> 05:34:40,960
Shut up bro.

8523
05:34:41,300 --> 05:34:42,520
Win the tournament now.

8524
05:34:42,600 --> 05:34:43,040
Yeah.

8525
05:34:43,060 --> 05:34:44,060
We got this.

8526
05:34:44,420 --> 05:34:46,400
This guy plays on a DS.

8527
05:34:46,560 --> 05:34:47,300
I swear to god.

8528
05:34:47,440 --> 05:34:49,120
I feel the fringe.

8529
05:34:50,920 --> 05:34:52,320
This guy is playing Eddy bro.

8530
05:34:52,320 --> 05:34:54,160
Pray to Jack Jesus right now.

8531
05:34:54,260 --> 05:34:54,640
Chat.

8532
05:34:55,080 --> 05:34:56,660
Get the prayers going in.

8533
05:34:57,120 --> 05:34:57,140
Uh oh.

8534
05:34:57,800 --> 05:35:00,680
You just have to be offensive until you think he's gonna power crash.

8535
05:35:00,800 --> 05:35:01,480
Then you have to launch that.

8536
05:35:03,720 --> 05:35:04,280
Offend him.

8537
05:35:04,780 --> 05:35:05,540
Round one.

8538
05:35:06,700 --> 05:35:07,100
Fight.

8539
05:35:20,390 --> 05:35:20,790
Infinite.

8540
05:35:20,930 --> 05:35:21,770
He hasn't learned.

8541
05:35:21,850 --> 05:35:22,230
Oh.

8542
05:35:22,330 --> 05:35:25,330
He doesn't know how to get up there.

8543
05:35:25,950 --> 05:35:26,830
I would have taught him.

8544
05:35:29,330 --> 05:35:30,270
I would have taught him.

8545
05:35:30,270 --> 05:35:30,810
I would have taught him bro.

8546
05:35:31,530 --> 05:35:32,630
If he was on the squad.

8547
05:35:48,100 --> 05:35:48,880
He's so freaky.

8548
05:35:49,700 --> 05:35:51,200
I don't know what character he does dude.

8549
05:35:51,360 --> 05:35:52,500
I'm literally just playing out feel.

8550
05:35:52,620 --> 05:35:55,000
Got it.

8551
05:35:55,380 --> 05:35:55,980
All good.

8552
05:35:56,120 --> 05:35:56,720
It's only one.

8553
05:35:57,960 --> 05:35:58,360
Wow.

8554
05:36:01,140 --> 05:36:01,540
Beautiful.

8555
05:36:02,820 --> 05:36:03,220
Fight.

8556
05:36:05,660 --> 05:36:06,840
That's a third hit.

8557
05:36:06,900 --> 05:36:07,060
Yeah.

8558
05:36:09,200 --> 05:36:09,720
Nice.

8559
05:36:13,320 --> 05:36:14,920
He's got guns in his hands.

8560
05:36:15,160 --> 05:36:15,860
It's fine.

8561
05:36:16,020 --> 05:36:16,140
It's fine.

8562
05:36:19,080 --> 05:36:20,020
It's still alive.

8563
05:36:21,500 --> 05:36:22,920
I know that's fucking launch.

8564
05:36:23,320 --> 05:36:24,760
What a block man.

8565
05:36:25,100 --> 05:36:26,540
Good fucking block.

8566
05:36:26,960 --> 05:36:28,020
What a read.

8567
05:36:28,320 --> 05:36:29,080
Come on baby.

8568
05:36:30,040 --> 05:36:30,560
Oh.

8569
05:36:33,220 --> 05:36:33,540
Oh fuck.

8570
05:36:33,700 --> 05:36:34,500
I wanted to dump for two.

8571
05:36:34,760 --> 05:36:35,320
It's okay.

8572
05:36:35,420 --> 05:36:36,180
You got the set.

8573
05:36:37,460 --> 05:36:37,860
Fight.

8574
05:36:41,480 --> 05:36:42,080
It's over.

8575
05:36:43,500 --> 05:36:43,900
It's over.

8576
05:36:44,560 --> 05:36:45,160
That's launch.

8577
05:36:45,700 --> 05:36:46,300
Scarecrow three.

8578
05:36:52,390 --> 05:36:52,910
Great job.

8579
05:36:53,330 --> 05:36:53,730
Great job.

8580
05:36:55,930 --> 05:36:56,610
That's launch.

8581
05:36:57,730 --> 05:36:58,390
He's dead.

8582
05:36:58,670 --> 05:36:59,070
Maybe.

8583
05:37:00,710 --> 05:37:01,290
Uh oh.

8584
05:37:01,290 --> 05:37:02,010
Maybe.

8585
05:37:03,030 --> 05:37:03,930
They're doing wall carry.

8586
05:37:05,370 --> 05:37:07,090
Why did I get the god wall?

8587
05:37:07,230 --> 05:37:07,630
I don't know.

8588
05:37:07,650 --> 05:37:07,970
Thank you.

8589
05:37:08,410 --> 05:37:08,850
No.

8590
05:37:11,010 --> 05:37:12,570
Oh my god.

8591
05:37:12,650 --> 05:37:13,750
Wall to wall?

8592
05:37:14,330 --> 05:37:15,650
Oh my god.

8593
05:37:16,410 --> 05:37:17,910
God wanted us to win.

8594
05:37:17,930 --> 05:37:18,810
God's first son.

8595
05:37:19,150 --> 05:37:20,170
God's favorite player.

8596
05:37:20,670 --> 05:37:21,710
God's favorite player.

8597
05:37:21,790 --> 05:37:22,410
He gave it to you.

8598
05:37:22,810 --> 05:37:24,270
Jack got mad freaky.

8599
05:37:25,950 --> 05:37:27,170
Happy Sunday everybody.

8600
05:37:27,350 --> 05:37:28,330
It is his day.

8601
05:37:29,810 --> 05:37:31,270
I can't believe he got it.

8602
05:37:32,250 --> 05:37:32,770
I was thinking about that wall.

8603
05:37:33,290 --> 05:37:34,970
I was thinking about it.

8604
05:37:35,350 --> 05:37:36,010
And dude.

8605
05:37:37,050 --> 05:37:38,810
I was like okay.

8606
05:37:39,050 --> 05:37:40,230
Maybe he's gonna stay on the ground.

8607
05:37:40,390 --> 05:37:41,210
Cause this is gonna whiff.

8608
05:37:41,230 --> 05:37:42,010
I gotta plant the seed.

8609
05:37:42,090 --> 05:37:43,950
It's not just clean splat.

8610
05:37:44,190 --> 05:37:45,210
That's crazy.

8611
05:37:47,830 --> 05:37:49,990
Get ready for the next battle.

8612
05:37:50,170 --> 05:37:50,590
Phew.

8613
05:37:57,050 --> 05:37:57,890
Round one.

8614
05:37:58,870 --> 05:37:59,390
Fight.

8615
05:38:02,650 --> 05:38:03,890
Oh my god.

8616
05:38:03,910 --> 05:38:04,410
He doesn't know that.

8617
05:38:05,830 --> 05:38:06,070
Eddie.

8618
05:38:07,110 --> 05:38:07,590
Boom.

8619
05:38:08,790 --> 05:38:09,270
One.

8620
05:38:10,990 --> 05:38:12,170
4-1-1.

8621
05:38:12,230 --> 05:38:12,630
He won.

8622
05:38:13,110 --> 05:38:14,050
1-1.

8623
05:38:15,970 --> 05:38:16,790
That's my goat.

8624
05:38:17,630 --> 05:38:18,470
Come on Eddie.

8625
05:38:18,550 --> 05:38:20,230
You have to use other numbers.

8626
05:38:20,710 --> 05:38:21,010
Fight.

8627
05:38:21,830 --> 05:38:22,310
Oh.

8628
05:38:24,250 --> 05:38:25,590
Get the fuck out of here.

8629
05:38:25,630 --> 05:38:26,150
Kick man.

8630
05:38:26,710 --> 05:38:28,490
That dodge though in the beginning.

8631
05:38:29,190 --> 05:38:30,230
Where's the dizzy meter?

8632
05:38:31,950 --> 05:38:34,210
I know his ass is dizzy as hell.

8633
05:38:34,310 --> 05:38:35,010
He's nauseous.

8634
05:38:35,150 --> 05:38:35,810
No way.

8635
05:38:35,830 --> 05:38:36,510
He's gonna kick.

8636
05:38:38,310 --> 05:38:39,150
Oh my god.

8637
05:38:39,150 --> 05:38:39,710
That's clean.

8638
05:38:39,710 --> 05:38:40,270
Nice punish.

8639
05:38:40,990 --> 05:38:41,890
Oh my god.

8640
05:38:42,530 --> 05:38:43,630
That was a nice punish.

8641
05:38:43,630 --> 05:38:44,390
Send the rocket.

8642
05:38:44,710 --> 05:38:46,110
Drop the fucking got him.

8643
05:38:46,370 --> 05:38:47,290
Drop the fucking.

8644
05:38:47,930 --> 05:38:49,050
I fucking got him.

8645
05:38:49,090 --> 05:38:50,190
The cross from space.

8646
05:38:52,530 --> 05:38:53,410
Pray chat.

8647
05:38:53,510 --> 05:38:53,930
Pray.

8648
05:38:56,430 --> 05:38:57,850
I swear to god it lagged.

8649
05:38:57,910 --> 05:38:58,690
I swear to god it lagged.

8650
05:38:59,650 --> 05:39:00,530
It's cool bro.

8651
05:39:00,530 --> 05:39:01,310
We bouncing here.

8652
05:39:02,890 --> 05:39:03,630
Oh my god.

8653
05:39:03,650 --> 05:39:03,990
Your feet.

8654
05:39:05,830 --> 05:39:06,490
It was fate.

8655
05:39:06,670 --> 05:39:08,190
We had to end the tournament this way.

8656
05:39:08,970 --> 05:39:10,170
Put him away Jack.

8657
05:39:10,650 --> 05:39:11,630
Come on Jack.

8658
05:39:11,670 --> 05:39:12,110
Oh my god.

8659
05:39:12,210 --> 05:39:12,410
No.

8660
05:39:13,830 --> 05:39:15,270
It's fine bro.

8661
05:39:15,550 --> 05:39:16,710
We believe in you.

8662
05:39:18,290 --> 05:39:19,330
Oh shit.

8663
05:39:19,910 --> 05:39:20,630
Come on.

8664
05:39:20,650 --> 05:39:21,070
It's Sunday.

8665
05:39:21,770 --> 05:39:22,570
It's Sunday.

8666
05:39:23,890 --> 05:39:25,070
This is your day.

8667
05:39:25,510 --> 05:39:27,790
Oh that's a punish.

8668
05:39:27,950 --> 05:39:28,650
But he's not dead.

8669
05:39:28,950 --> 05:39:30,130
Oh it's counter hit though.

8670
05:39:30,130 --> 05:39:33,230
No way the tournament ends here.

8671
05:39:33,230 --> 05:39:34,470
That'd be insane.

8672
05:39:35,550 --> 05:39:37,250
Alright chat.

8673
05:39:37,350 --> 05:39:38,470
Oh my goodness.

8674
05:39:41,210 --> 05:39:42,270
That's it.

8675
05:39:42,770 --> 05:39:43,790
It's an end.

8676
05:39:43,790 --> 05:39:44,230
It's an end.

8677
05:39:44,350 --> 05:39:44,950
Oh.

8678
05:39:47,030 --> 05:39:47,970
Jesus.

8679
05:39:50,010 --> 05:39:51,650
Jack Jesus.

8680
05:39:52,800 --> 05:39:53,810
My savior.

8681
05:39:55,190 --> 05:39:56,670
My ass.

8682
05:39:56,730 --> 05:39:58,310
This is a new fucking game.

8683
05:40:00,010 --> 05:40:01,550
Uninstall now.

8684
05:40:01,990 --> 05:40:03,070
Uninstall now.

8685
05:40:04,330 --> 05:40:06,070
Holy shit man.

8686
05:40:06,210 --> 05:40:07,030
Oh my god.

8687
05:40:07,030 --> 05:40:07,610
Many blessings.

8688
05:40:08,370 --> 05:40:09,470
Fuck yeah.

8689
05:40:09,870 --> 05:40:12,450
Many blessings upon all chats.

8690
05:40:12,730 --> 05:40:14,410
He is risen once more.

8691
05:40:16,350 --> 05:40:17,890
Oh my god.

8692
05:40:17,890 --> 05:40:18,030
Oh my dude.

8693
05:40:18,130 --> 05:40:19,010
We got first.

8694
05:40:19,430 --> 05:40:20,910
We fucking did it.

8695
05:40:20,930 --> 05:40:22,070
We fucking did it man.

8696
05:40:22,950 --> 05:40:24,070
The Doki Diff.

8697
05:40:24,070 --> 05:40:25,310
The Doki Diff.

8698
05:40:25,410 --> 05:40:27,510
Oh my god.

8699
05:40:27,510 --> 05:40:29,450
I clutched it when it matters.

8700
05:40:32,470 --> 05:40:33,930
I can't believe that.

8701
05:40:34,010 --> 05:40:35,050
I can't believe it.

8702
05:40:35,170 --> 05:40:36,830
Ball pool did not have to play.

8703
05:40:38,550 --> 05:40:40,850
It's just like the first slam all over again.

8704
05:40:41,050 --> 05:40:41,770
You can rest.

8705
05:40:42,070 --> 05:40:42,850
He can rest.

8706
05:40:42,850 --> 05:40:43,970
That's asking for an exhibition.

8707
05:40:44,470 --> 05:40:45,350
I'm about to say no.

8708
05:40:45,710 --> 05:40:46,910
That's the profit bro.

8709
05:40:46,990 --> 05:40:47,470
Come on.

8710
05:40:47,470 --> 05:40:48,030
Do an exhibition.

8711
05:40:48,770 --> 05:40:49,770
Let's do take a ball.

8712
05:40:49,910 --> 05:40:50,310
Take a ball.

8713
05:40:50,370 --> 05:40:50,750
Take a ball.

8714
05:40:50,830 --> 05:40:51,450
Do it.

8715
05:40:51,470 --> 05:40:51,950
Do it.

8716
05:40:52,430 --> 05:40:53,370
It's worth nothing.

8717
05:40:54,350 --> 05:40:55,870
Your team already won.

8718
05:40:56,250 --> 05:40:57,490
I want to see you play.

8719
05:40:57,510 --> 05:40:58,590
I want to see you play again for the road.

8720
05:40:58,690 --> 05:41:00,270
For the homies.

8721
05:41:00,270 --> 05:41:01,010
Do it for the family.

8722
05:41:01,410 --> 05:41:01,530
No pressure.

8723
05:41:01,810 --> 05:41:02,130
Nothing.

8724
05:41:02,270 --> 05:41:03,530
Just let's get it.

8725
05:41:06,270 --> 05:41:07,810
It's the after party bro.

8726
05:41:10,090 --> 05:41:11,710
They want to ban King.

8727
05:41:12,350 --> 05:41:13,370
I'm just going on.

8728
05:41:14,430 --> 05:41:15,950
Three Kings win it.

8729
05:41:15,950 --> 05:41:16,250
True.

8730
05:41:16,950 --> 05:41:17,870
Well, well, well.

8731
05:41:18,110 --> 05:41:19,190
What up team Brawl Pro?

8732
05:41:19,390 --> 05:41:19,870
Hi.

8733
05:41:20,470 --> 05:41:20,990
Hey.

8734
05:41:22,610 --> 05:41:23,230
What's good?

8735
05:41:23,230 --> 05:41:27,350
Can I just say congratulations to Doki for winning a tripping game?

8736
05:41:27,350 --> 05:41:28,330
Let's fucking go.

8737
05:41:29,450 --> 05:41:29,930
True.

8738
05:41:29,990 --> 05:41:33,230
I have a 30 on defense.

8739
05:41:35,030 --> 05:41:35,510
Wait.

8740
05:41:36,710 --> 05:41:38,930
You actually clutched up big time against us.

8741
05:41:38,950 --> 05:41:39,570
You did.

8742
05:41:39,870 --> 05:41:42,390
You really fucking did dude.

8743
05:41:42,770 --> 05:41:43,430
That was on.

8744
05:41:43,450 --> 05:41:43,890
How many.

8745
05:41:43,950 --> 05:41:45,790
I feel like you've been putting in the night shift.

8746
05:41:45,970 --> 05:41:46,930
Is that the case?

8747
05:41:47,050 --> 05:41:48,730
Like Doki is the late night Tekken grinder.

8748
05:41:48,770 --> 05:41:49,070
Yeah.

8749
05:41:49,070 --> 05:41:50,510
I'm the late night Tekken grinder.

8750
05:41:50,510 --> 05:41:52,470
I only play Tekken at night.

8751
05:41:52,890 --> 05:41:53,490
I look.

8752
05:41:53,570 --> 05:41:55,590
It's like 2 AM and you're like yo BP you up?

8753
05:41:55,730 --> 05:41:58,190
Like yo what's good?

8754
05:41:58,350 --> 05:42:00,190
And then he's just like I'll get out of bed.

8755
05:42:00,370 --> 05:42:01,070
Like I'll pull up.

8756
05:42:01,150 --> 05:42:01,490
What's good?

8757
05:42:01,570 --> 05:42:02,830
So I'm very impressed.

8758
05:42:04,970 --> 05:42:06,930
But I was going to say congrats to all of your team.

8759
05:42:07,070 --> 05:42:08,350
You all played very, very well.

8760
05:42:08,470 --> 05:42:09,570
I'm impressed with your performance.

8761
05:42:10,350 --> 05:42:13,190
First time that we didn't see Brawl Pro have to clutch it up too.

8762
05:42:13,710 --> 05:42:14,050
I know.

8763
05:42:14,130 --> 05:42:15,490
No, that's wrong actually.

8764
05:42:15,670 --> 05:42:16,990
Cause I had to against Tony.

8765
05:42:17,190 --> 05:42:17,410
Remember?

8766
05:42:18,150 --> 05:42:18,950
Oh, I know.

8767
05:42:19,010 --> 05:42:19,410
That's what I'm saying.

8768
05:42:19,470 --> 05:42:20,490
You didn't have to play that game.

8769
05:42:20,510 --> 05:42:21,290
It's the first time you did.

8770
05:42:21,350 --> 05:42:26,290
He had to win so many high pressure sets dude.

8771
05:42:26,410 --> 05:42:27,890
He had to get us to the finals.

8772
05:42:28,110 --> 05:42:29,770
But then we finish it off for him.

8773
05:42:30,450 --> 05:42:31,470
Memories of Slam 1.

8774
05:42:31,750 --> 05:42:32,150
Yeah.

8775
05:42:32,550 --> 05:42:33,470
I was going to say.

8776
05:42:33,530 --> 05:42:34,770
I was going to ask for all of you.

8777
05:42:36,210 --> 05:42:37,810
How is his coaching style?

8778
05:42:37,910 --> 05:42:39,810
What do you like about being on Brawl Pro's team?

8779
05:42:40,050 --> 05:42:41,450
Dude, I say what is this?

8780
05:42:41,530 --> 05:42:43,350
And then he doesn't fucking answer me.

8781
05:42:45,250 --> 05:42:47,550
I don't know why he does that to Matt only.

8782
05:42:48,330 --> 05:42:49,190
That's kind of weird.

8783
05:42:49,490 --> 05:42:49,810
I swear to God.

8784
05:42:50,510 --> 05:42:50,870
Is that personal?

8785
05:42:51,710 --> 05:42:53,230
That guy knows how to play Slam 2.

8786
05:42:53,350 --> 05:42:53,990
I'll just leave him alone.

8787
05:42:54,230 --> 05:42:55,570
He leaves me alone.

8788
05:42:55,810 --> 05:42:57,390
He thinks I'll figure it out myself.

8789
05:42:57,610 --> 05:42:58,170
I don't understand.

8790
05:42:58,430 --> 05:42:59,130
But you know what?

8791
05:42:59,170 --> 05:42:59,650
He was right.

8792
05:42:59,710 --> 05:43:00,850
He must be goaded.

8793
05:43:00,970 --> 05:43:02,110
You're the oldest child.

8794
05:43:02,370 --> 05:43:03,910
You don't need as much help as us.

8795
05:43:04,110 --> 05:43:04,970
Yeah, that's true.

8796
05:43:04,990 --> 05:43:06,250
He just gives you your own designs.

8797
05:43:06,670 --> 05:43:07,470
You're the oldest.

8798
05:43:07,750 --> 05:43:08,550
You have to take care of us.

8799
05:43:08,650 --> 05:43:09,210
You need more help man.

8800
05:43:09,950 --> 05:43:11,190
I was going to say also.

8801
05:43:11,530 --> 05:43:13,110
You look like you locked in Matt.

8802
05:43:13,250 --> 05:43:14,150
You played really well.

8803
05:43:14,750 --> 05:43:18,850
Today especially I feel like you were pretty solid looking in every single set that I saw you play.

8804
05:43:18,850 --> 05:43:24,970
I played Tekken until 7am last minute because I was like there's no way I'm fucking losing.

8805
05:43:25,970 --> 05:43:30,450
We covered like Alyssa and stuff but not Zaf I don't think.

8806
05:43:31,590 --> 05:43:37,450
I encountered a Zafina, a supreme Zafina who I was just doing like a ranked grind.

8807
05:43:37,710 --> 05:43:40,570
Like I kept kewing into her at 7am like constantly.

8808
05:43:40,690 --> 05:43:41,570
And that was my practice.

8809
05:43:41,650 --> 05:43:42,050
I got lucky.

8810
05:43:42,930 --> 05:43:44,430
I was also going to say.

8811
05:43:44,570 --> 05:43:46,450
So Dokia are you coming to EVO?

8812
05:43:47,230 --> 05:43:47,750
Maybe.

8813
05:43:50,150 --> 05:43:51,270
I'm just checking.

8814
05:43:51,470 --> 05:43:51,950
I'm just checking.

8815
05:43:51,950 --> 05:43:56,350
I really appreciate you playing in the tournament regardless.

8816
05:43:56,710 --> 05:43:58,390
It's very nice of you to do so.

8817
05:43:58,470 --> 05:43:59,430
If you want to come.

8818
05:44:00,210 --> 05:44:01,310
You know let me know.

8819
05:44:01,390 --> 05:44:02,070
I'd appreciate it.

8820
05:44:02,090 --> 05:44:04,170
They are asking for a coach match if you guys want to play.

8821
05:44:04,510 --> 05:44:05,910
Do it do it do it bro.

8822
05:44:06,290 --> 05:44:07,470
I was going to say.

8823
05:44:08,510 --> 05:44:10,710
EVO offered to fly the first place team out.

8824
05:44:11,190 --> 05:44:12,370
If you guys want.

8825
05:44:12,870 --> 05:44:14,710
And you're cool with it and EVO doesn't mind.

8826
05:44:14,910 --> 05:44:16,310
If you want to pass your trip down.

8827
05:44:16,710 --> 05:44:17,670
To second place.

8828
05:44:18,850 --> 05:44:19,690
And you guys want to pass third place instead.

8829
05:44:21,010 --> 05:44:22,230
Well I don't know.

8830
05:44:23,790 --> 05:44:25,730
We got to think about it.

8831
05:44:25,910 --> 05:44:26,570
You know what I mean.

8832
05:44:26,770 --> 05:44:29,010
We're talking about a per diem lobster dinner.

8833
05:44:29,310 --> 05:44:31,090
Yeah I think we get a per diem instead.

8834
05:44:31,310 --> 05:44:32,650
What about our budget?

8835
05:44:33,170 --> 05:44:34,430
Our EVO budget.

8836
05:44:35,430 --> 05:44:36,250
Okay let me just.

8837
05:44:36,330 --> 05:44:38,570
Tony they said.

8838
05:44:38,570 --> 05:44:39,630
They said go fuck yourself.

8839
05:44:39,910 --> 05:44:43,770
I can still go right?

8840
05:44:43,930 --> 05:44:47,630
It would have been down to 1 until Tony said.

8841
05:44:47,630 --> 05:44:47,730
Yeah.

8842
05:44:48,490 --> 05:44:49,630
No the orphans.

8843
05:44:49,650 --> 05:44:50,610
No not them either.

8844
05:44:50,730 --> 05:44:51,510
The orphans can't come.

8845
05:44:51,610 --> 05:44:53,310
Yeah sorry so I got off the phone with Tony.

8846
05:44:54,750 --> 05:44:55,470
Seems understandable.

8847
05:44:55,850 --> 05:44:56,670
I'm down with that.

8848
05:44:56,870 --> 05:44:58,590
I guess I lost it for all of us guys.

8849
05:44:58,710 --> 05:44:59,810
None of us are going to EVO.

8850
05:45:01,130 --> 05:45:01,850
Sorry guys.

8851
05:45:02,610 --> 05:45:03,530
So you know.

8852
05:45:03,610 --> 05:45:05,050
Thanks to all of you for playing by the way.

8853
05:45:05,150 --> 05:45:05,670
I really really appreciate it.

8854
05:45:05,670 --> 05:45:06,530
Thanks for having us man.

8855
05:45:06,530 --> 05:45:08,290
Yeah I'd love to do another.

8856
05:45:08,430 --> 05:45:10,150
If you ever do another Sajab Slam.

8857
05:45:10,270 --> 05:45:11,290
I'd love to join again.

8858
05:45:11,530 --> 05:45:12,190
It's been so fun.

8859
05:45:12,450 --> 05:45:15,670
Good luck in your coaches match.

8860
05:45:15,950 --> 05:45:17,130
Why the fuck are you on Kuma?

8861
05:45:17,990 --> 05:45:19,130
Wait he's playing Kuma?

8862
05:45:19,330 --> 05:45:21,190
Why the hell is this dude on Kuma?

8863
05:45:21,930 --> 05:45:23,370
Because Kuma is the GOAT.

8864
05:45:23,590 --> 05:45:25,790
Uh oh big ass bear watch out.

8865
05:45:25,910 --> 05:45:26,810
Oh my god.

8866
05:45:29,610 --> 05:45:32,730
I played Fii with King twice already.

8867
05:45:32,870 --> 05:45:34,430
In both round robins.

8868
05:45:35,110 --> 05:45:36,270
He wouldn't expect.

8869
05:45:36,530 --> 05:45:36,970
Oh!

8870
05:45:39,110 --> 05:45:39,950
Broken plate.

8871
05:45:39,990 --> 05:45:40,990
A cat and a bear.

8872
05:45:41,670 --> 05:45:42,530
This is no joke.

8873
05:45:43,970 --> 05:45:46,030
Jesus Christ that sounded like it hurt.

8874
05:45:47,810 --> 05:45:49,150
Yeah you heard that shit?

8875
05:45:49,270 --> 05:45:51,770
Like a gunshot bite to the ground man.

8876
05:45:52,010 --> 05:45:52,270
Uh oh.

8877
05:45:54,550 --> 05:45:56,170
Hit him with a cool move coach.

8878
05:45:57,550 --> 05:45:58,990
Do a cool move.

8879
05:45:59,470 --> 05:46:00,750
Yeah do a cool move.

8880
05:46:01,030 --> 05:46:01,610
Coach get up.

8881
05:46:02,470 --> 05:46:03,790
Do it come on.

8882
05:46:03,830 --> 05:46:04,550
Do the move.

8883
05:46:06,530 --> 05:46:10,290
Maybe we should have gone kick coach.

8884
05:46:11,870 --> 05:46:13,210
Coach where is the king?

8885
05:46:13,350 --> 05:46:13,550
Go Paul.

8886
05:46:13,630 --> 05:46:14,110
Go Paul.

8887
05:46:14,110 --> 05:46:14,770
Go Paul please.

8888
05:46:15,010 --> 05:46:16,690
Oh go Paul.

8889
05:46:16,870 --> 05:46:19,170
Oh my god.

8890
05:46:19,210 --> 05:46:20,010
Oh shit.

8891
05:46:20,190 --> 05:46:27,690
I haven't played Paul in like two months.

8892
05:46:28,070 --> 05:46:29,670
I don't care bro kick his ass.

8893
05:46:29,850 --> 05:46:30,810
Yeah kick his ass.

8894
05:46:33,010 --> 05:46:34,770
He's only Tekken God Supreme.

8895
05:46:34,770 --> 05:46:36,530
Let's do a cool move coach.

8896
05:46:36,790 --> 05:46:37,270
What the?

8897
05:46:37,530 --> 05:46:41,470
Oh dude the alley kicks up before Kuma.

8898
05:46:46,830 --> 05:46:48,010
Oh that's good.

8899
05:46:48,170 --> 05:46:48,470
Yeah.

8900
05:46:48,750 --> 05:46:48,870
Oh that's good.

8901
05:46:49,910 --> 05:46:50,950
Oh that's good.

8902
05:46:50,950 --> 05:46:52,790
Oh that's good.

8903
05:46:53,370 --> 05:46:54,370
That's a fast move.

8904
05:46:55,550 --> 05:46:56,070
Fight.

8905
05:46:59,930 --> 05:47:00,890
No wait we go.

8906
05:47:01,450 --> 05:47:01,970
Okay.

8907
05:47:06,700 --> 05:47:07,560
Hook our ass.

8908
05:47:07,560 --> 05:47:07,920
One moves.

8909
05:47:08,240 --> 05:47:10,220
He does.

8910
05:47:10,480 --> 05:47:11,500
What the fuck.

8911
05:47:15,060 --> 05:47:16,160
Coach come on.

8912
05:47:16,540 --> 05:47:17,840
Oh that's kind of pretty I like that.

8913
05:47:18,260 --> 05:47:18,880
Got it.

8914
05:47:18,880 --> 05:47:20,400
Oh nice.

8915
05:47:21,620 --> 05:47:22,580
Setting missile.

8916
05:47:25,720 --> 05:47:27,040
You think that thing tastes good?

8917
05:47:28,220 --> 05:47:29,420
Bro roast that.

8918
05:47:31,880 --> 05:47:32,880
Watch this mix.

8919
05:47:33,100 --> 05:47:33,760
Maybe I'm just hungry.

8920
05:47:34,940 --> 05:47:37,380
We've been playing Tekken for six hours.

8921
05:47:37,660 --> 05:47:39,240
Actually I'm fucking starving.

8922
05:47:39,580 --> 05:47:40,760
What the fuck.

8923
05:47:41,020 --> 05:47:41,380
Fight.

8924
05:47:43,060 --> 05:47:44,980
Respectfully coach I'm gonna need you to lock in.

8925
05:47:45,040 --> 05:47:46,600
Yeah coach.

8926
05:47:47,000 --> 05:47:48,920
There we go yeah.

8927
05:47:49,580 --> 05:47:50,080
Yeah.

8928
05:47:50,640 --> 05:47:53,020
That move is silly.

8929
05:47:54,500 --> 05:47:56,020
Such good wall running inputs.

8930
05:47:56,300 --> 05:47:57,360
He does it on a lever too.

8931
05:47:57,840 --> 05:47:58,880
How does he do it?

8932
05:47:59,060 --> 05:47:59,980
Let's see Paul Allen's lever.

8933
05:48:02,440 --> 05:48:03,400
Uh oh.

8934
05:48:03,800 --> 05:48:07,060
Oh no way they gave him that one.

8935
05:48:07,100 --> 05:48:09,060
That wall is hunking me pretty hard.

8936
05:48:09,240 --> 05:48:10,400
It's the fee difference.

8937
05:48:12,320 --> 05:48:14,160
Back to one perfectly planned.

8938
05:48:14,520 --> 05:48:15,660
Are you kidding me?

8939
05:48:17,280 --> 05:48:17,980
Oh no.

8940
05:48:18,060 --> 05:48:18,660
Oh no.

8941
05:48:18,860 --> 05:48:20,140
Hit her one time coach.

8942
05:48:20,400 --> 05:48:21,640
Hit her one time coach.

8943
05:48:21,840 --> 05:48:23,520
Come on coach just put it in.

8944
05:48:24,260 --> 05:48:24,740
No.

8945
05:48:25,060 --> 05:48:25,540
No.

8946
05:48:27,760 --> 05:48:29,960
Well actually this isn't even your main so you have to go.

8947
05:48:29,980 --> 05:48:30,840
Yeah yeah that's fine.

8948
05:48:30,920 --> 05:48:32,000
You almost beat her.

8949
05:48:32,620 --> 05:48:33,960
You almost beat them.

8950
05:48:34,980 --> 05:48:35,500
Exactly.

8951
05:48:36,960 --> 05:48:38,900
That's just embarrassing for them.

8952
05:48:39,460 --> 05:48:41,120
He tried so hard.

8953
05:48:41,440 --> 05:48:42,960
That shit was so close on Kuma.

8954
05:48:43,980 --> 05:48:45,120
I wanna stay bear.

8955
05:48:46,040 --> 05:48:47,000
Stay bear?

8956
05:48:47,660 --> 05:48:48,620
Come on.

8957
05:48:48,680 --> 05:48:50,840
You have to play until we get another set.

8958
05:48:50,940 --> 05:48:52,620
You gotta play king so we can get another set.

8959
05:48:53,680 --> 05:48:55,740
There's nothing wrong with bear.

8960
05:48:57,660 --> 05:48:59,060
You can play the bear.

8961
05:49:00,000 --> 05:49:00,920
Come on.

8962
05:49:01,200 --> 05:49:03,380
I do support bear to be fair.

8963
05:49:03,420 --> 05:49:04,340
I'll support bear.

8964
05:49:04,700 --> 05:49:05,660
What about Paul?

8965
05:49:07,760 --> 05:49:10,240
You're asking for Paul but I would.

8966
05:49:10,420 --> 05:49:12,200
I just haven't played him in like two months.

8967
05:49:12,460 --> 05:49:14,060
Make them play a different character.

8968
05:49:14,600 --> 05:49:15,400
He's so scared.

8969
05:49:16,840 --> 05:49:18,380
You are scared to play Paul.

8970
05:49:18,680 --> 05:49:19,000
Yeah.

8971
05:49:19,480 --> 05:49:20,380
And that's...

8972
05:49:21,120 --> 05:49:22,160
dare I say pathetic.

8973
05:49:23,940 --> 05:49:25,100
That's a moral failing.

8974
05:49:27,740 --> 05:49:29,340
No I wanna play king.

8975
05:49:29,340 --> 05:49:29,680
He's fine.

8976
05:49:30,780 --> 05:49:31,720
There you go.

8977
05:49:31,840 --> 05:49:32,080
True.

8978
05:49:37,950 --> 05:49:39,270
We blocked that.

8979
05:49:39,270 --> 05:49:39,430
Nice.

8980
05:49:39,870 --> 05:49:41,190
What's the cool combo?

8981
05:49:41,410 --> 05:49:43,050
Do the really cool showcase combo.

8982
05:49:44,430 --> 05:49:45,710
It's kinda boring coach.

8983
05:49:47,090 --> 05:49:48,190
Let's do a cool thing.

8984
05:49:52,140 --> 05:49:53,460
Oh that was a cool step.

8985
05:49:54,360 --> 05:49:54,880
Beautiful.

8986
05:49:56,340 --> 05:49:56,860
Okay.

8987
05:49:58,740 --> 05:49:59,460
Did he bounce?

8988
05:49:59,500 --> 05:49:59,980
What did we do?

8989
05:50:00,860 --> 05:50:02,220
We did something cool.

8990
05:50:02,380 --> 05:50:03,500
Fuck optimization.

8991
05:50:04,360 --> 05:50:05,420
That was optimal.

8992
05:50:06,120 --> 05:50:08,140
That was fucking...

8993
05:50:08,140 --> 05:50:09,320
I'm saying you...

8994
05:50:09,320 --> 05:50:10,140
Fuck optimization.

8995
05:50:10,240 --> 05:50:11,300
Show me some cool shit.

8996
05:50:11,440 --> 05:50:12,720
Yeah show me all the cool combos.

8997
05:50:13,200 --> 05:50:14,260
That can never do.

8998
05:50:16,200 --> 05:50:16,900
Oh wow.

8999
05:50:17,020 --> 05:50:17,400
Time out?

9000
05:50:17,640 --> 05:50:18,460
Woah woah.

9001
05:50:18,680 --> 05:50:19,580
This is chess.

9002
05:50:21,900 --> 05:50:22,460
Oh.

9003
05:50:23,420 --> 05:50:24,080
Let's go.

9004
05:50:24,500 --> 05:50:25,060
Yes!

9005
05:50:25,640 --> 05:50:28,840
3% 3% dip.

9006
05:50:31,000 --> 05:50:32,400
Bro do the wall jump again.

9007
05:50:32,500 --> 05:50:33,320
That was so cool.

9008
05:50:33,500 --> 05:50:35,420
That was not happening again.

9009
05:50:35,680 --> 05:50:36,900
Do the wall jump bro.

9010
05:50:36,900 --> 05:50:38,240
Do the wall jump coach.

9011
05:50:38,280 --> 05:50:39,160
Hit the spider man.

9012
05:50:44,380 --> 05:50:45,140
Uh oh.

9013
05:50:45,460 --> 05:50:47,520
No way he does it 3 times right?

9014
05:50:49,380 --> 05:50:50,240
She's mad easy.

9015
05:50:50,560 --> 05:50:53,080
Can you giant swing PDX 3 times?

9016
05:50:53,360 --> 05:50:54,300
Yeah yeah can you do that?

9017
05:50:54,300 --> 05:50:54,980
In a row.

9018
05:50:55,080 --> 05:50:56,800
Like don't do anything else but giant swing.

9019
05:50:57,600 --> 05:50:58,200
Yeah yeah.

9020
05:50:58,260 --> 05:50:58,880
Now do it again.

9021
05:50:58,880 --> 05:51:00,740
I don't think he's gonna live.

9022
05:51:00,940 --> 05:51:01,680
Poor PDX bro.

9023
05:51:02,220 --> 05:51:04,060
Bro he's trying his hardest out right now.

9024
05:51:04,180 --> 05:51:05,920
Lily isn't gonna be able to talk after this.

9025
05:51:06,020 --> 05:51:07,760
Her brain is just pasting to her skull.

9026
05:51:08,360 --> 05:51:09,320
Round 3.

9027
05:51:10,360 --> 05:51:10,840
Fight.

9028
05:51:11,380 --> 05:51:13,680
Bro is being audio terrorized.

9029
05:51:17,660 --> 05:51:18,760
Oh he took damage.

9030
05:51:20,120 --> 05:51:21,100
Oh he took damage.

9031
05:51:21,100 --> 05:51:21,100
Okay.

9032
05:51:21,240 --> 05:51:21,900
Oh nice.

9033
05:51:22,080 --> 05:51:24,880
Alright I see coach we condition 2 to then do 1.

9034
05:51:25,040 --> 05:51:25,360
True.

9035
05:51:27,480 --> 05:51:28,220
Oh wow.

9036
05:51:31,280 --> 05:51:32,120
Oh wow.

9037
05:51:34,000 --> 05:51:34,420
Oh wow.

9038
05:51:34,420 --> 05:51:35,560
Bro Fee might be the GOAT.

9039
05:51:36,800 --> 05:51:38,400
I might have a new coach next slim.

9040
05:51:38,780 --> 05:51:38,800
I might have a new coach next slim.

9041
05:51:39,120 --> 05:51:39,540
Wait.

9042
05:51:41,700 --> 05:51:42,560
He's kinda not.

9043
05:51:42,660 --> 05:51:43,540
I wonder if he can teach me.

9044
05:51:43,560 --> 05:51:43,780
Lily!

9045
05:51:44,980 --> 05:51:47,420
Bro bro you really got led coach Cody?

9046
05:51:47,420 --> 05:51:48,080
What are you aiming at?

9047
05:51:49,380 --> 05:51:49,800
Oh!

9048
05:51:50,860 --> 05:51:52,060
Oh this is it.

9049
05:51:53,240 --> 05:51:54,540
Tony you made him mad.

9050
05:51:54,580 --> 05:51:55,340
You made our coach mad.

9051
05:51:55,360 --> 05:51:55,940
Look at him.

9052
05:51:56,000 --> 05:51:57,460
Now he's taking it out on her.

9053
05:51:57,680 --> 05:51:59,580
Not mad coach you're the only one for me.

9054
05:52:00,720 --> 05:52:02,180
Oh staying up with the spring kick?

9055
05:52:02,260 --> 05:52:02,840
Are you crazy?

9056
05:52:03,200 --> 05:52:04,860
I don't know why that worked.

9057
05:52:08,260 --> 05:52:09,460
Right garage coach.

9058
05:52:10,220 --> 05:52:11,000
Death Cater.

9059
05:52:11,120 --> 05:52:11,620
Death Cater.

9060
05:52:12,320 --> 05:52:13,580
Okay how long is this?

9061
05:52:13,700 --> 05:52:14,200
That's the last.

9062
05:52:14,340 --> 05:52:15,900
Actually go for RDC I'm not kidding.

9063
05:52:16,020 --> 05:52:16,460
Do the RDC.

9064
05:52:16,740 --> 05:52:18,220
They would never expect it.

9065
05:52:18,540 --> 05:52:19,640
Show me something cool coach.

9066
05:52:20,460 --> 05:52:22,820
You made me remove my RDC binds.

9067
05:52:23,340 --> 05:52:24,200
Or K-Pitch.

9068
05:52:25,880 --> 05:52:26,760
RDC binds?

9069
05:52:26,920 --> 05:52:28,560
Yeah I had RDC binds.

9070
05:52:28,660 --> 05:52:29,880
He made me remove it.

9071
05:52:30,000 --> 05:52:30,780
Cause I kept accident.

9072
05:52:30,780 --> 05:52:31,220
He wants it.

9073
05:52:31,280 --> 05:52:31,960
I can see it.

9074
05:52:32,120 --> 05:52:33,380
I see him fishing.

9075
05:52:33,600 --> 05:52:34,560
He wants it so bad.

9076
05:52:36,980 --> 05:52:38,440
How do we lock it in?

9077
05:52:38,960 --> 05:52:39,400
Oh.

9078
05:52:39,600 --> 05:52:40,040
Oh.

9079
05:52:40,280 --> 05:52:40,380
Oh.

9080
05:52:40,500 --> 05:52:41,220
What the fuck?

9081
05:52:41,260 --> 05:52:41,520
Wow!

9082
05:52:45,620 --> 05:52:46,820
Let him go!

9083
05:52:48,040 --> 05:52:49,340
Oh that's a lot of kicks.

9084
05:52:49,800 --> 05:52:50,620
Lock in brother.

9085
05:52:50,760 --> 05:52:51,060
Ouch.

9086
05:52:51,520 --> 05:52:51,960
Ouch.

9087
05:52:51,960 --> 05:52:52,560
Ouch.

9088
05:52:53,200 --> 05:52:53,640
Oh.

9089
05:52:55,680 --> 05:52:56,560
That plays king.

9090
05:52:56,560 --> 05:52:58,240
That is how true champion fights.

9091
05:52:58,540 --> 05:53:00,040
For the one time hit the RDC though.

9092
05:53:00,120 --> 05:53:00,900
Yeah yeah yeah.

9093
05:53:01,120 --> 05:53:05,280
His ass will break it.

9094
05:53:05,760 --> 05:53:06,480
Come on.

9095
05:53:06,540 --> 05:53:07,740
It's got the new hole too.

9096
05:53:09,560 --> 05:53:10,880
You think he knows that?

9097
05:53:11,180 --> 05:53:13,160
Yeah but he won it for the content.

9098
05:53:14,180 --> 05:53:15,660
But what if he's trying to break something else?

9099
05:53:15,740 --> 05:53:17,360
Cause he's like there's no way he can RDC.

9100
05:53:17,360 --> 05:53:20,540
If he gets rolling death cradle, FDX will never live that down.

9101
05:53:20,660 --> 05:53:21,440
Even for content.

9102
05:53:21,960 --> 05:53:23,900
There's no way he's not pressing 2.

9103
05:53:24,080 --> 05:53:25,660
He's taking kicked off this guys.

9104
05:53:25,960 --> 05:53:28,200
Like he's gonna get his drop sponsor.

9105
05:53:28,380 --> 05:53:29,560
They're gonna call him out.

9106
05:53:29,560 --> 05:53:31,060
It's in his contract.

9107
05:53:31,260 --> 05:53:33,860
He's like never get RDC'd.

9108
05:53:34,300 --> 05:53:35,640
You had to press 2 dude.

9109
05:53:36,020 --> 05:53:37,940
He's hit 2 once bro.

9110
05:53:38,460 --> 05:53:38,820
Fire!

9111
05:53:40,260 --> 05:53:41,200
That war.

9112
05:53:41,220 --> 05:53:41,680
That war.

9113
05:53:41,900 --> 05:53:44,060
Can't stop me.

9114
05:53:45,620 --> 05:53:46,660
All right.

9115
05:53:46,660 --> 05:53:48,120
Painting sausage I do.

9116
05:53:48,440 --> 05:53:50,060
I'm not New York City.

9117
05:53:51,120 --> 05:53:51,940
He's a.

9118
05:53:51,960 --> 05:53:52,140
Smart.

9119
05:53:54,360 --> 05:53:56,860
There's a fucking cheater in town square.

9120
05:53:59,060 --> 05:54:01,600
This bloody cheater is harassing me.

9121
05:54:01,940 --> 05:54:03,060
Where's the bobbies?

9122
05:54:05,840 --> 05:54:08,100
Just can't put a chicken pie in the pub.

9123
05:54:09,420 --> 05:54:10,940
Where's the bobbies in this lot?

9124
05:54:11,140 --> 05:54:13,000
This bloke just poked me in my toes.

9125
05:54:16,220 --> 05:54:18,080
I'll have the fucking chips after this.

9126
05:54:18,080 --> 05:54:18,340
I will.

9127
05:54:19,900 --> 05:54:21,560
Oh, she's playing it!

9128
05:54:22,380 --> 05:54:24,380
Oh, that cheeky cat!

9129
05:54:24,720 --> 05:54:26,120
That cheeky cat!

9130
05:54:26,260 --> 05:54:26,680
Help me!

9131
05:54:30,040 --> 05:54:31,760
Oh, bloody hell!

9132
05:54:31,980 --> 05:54:32,720
Me back!

9133
05:54:34,980 --> 05:54:36,900
Why are you mashing, Fi?

9134
05:54:37,000 --> 05:54:37,820
What are you doing?

9135
05:54:37,860 --> 05:54:38,700
That's meaty!

9136
05:54:41,900 --> 05:54:42,580
RDC!

9137
05:54:42,580 --> 05:54:43,260
RDC!

9138
05:54:44,500 --> 05:54:45,180
RDC!

9139
05:54:46,060 --> 05:54:46,540
RDC!

9140
05:54:46,540 --> 05:54:48,960
At least go for it, coach!

9141
05:54:48,980 --> 05:54:50,100
Come on, go for it!

9142
05:54:50,320 --> 05:54:51,000
Keep him honest.

9143
05:54:51,200 --> 05:54:52,500
You gotta keep him honest about it.

9144
05:54:53,960 --> 05:54:56,680
Oh, he wants... I see it!

9145
05:54:56,800 --> 05:54:57,600
Yeah, he sees it.

9146
05:54:57,640 --> 05:54:57,920
He's like...

9147
05:54:58,500 --> 05:54:58,720
Okay!

9148
05:54:59,000 --> 05:54:59,320
Two!

9149
05:54:59,820 --> 05:55:00,260
Okay!

9150
05:55:00,560 --> 05:55:00,980
Two!

9151
05:55:01,340 --> 05:55:01,680
Two!

9152
05:55:02,840 --> 05:55:03,720
He's like, no!

9153
05:55:03,720 --> 05:55:05,600
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

9154
05:55:05,800 --> 05:55:06,140
He knows.

9155
05:55:06,240 --> 05:55:06,640
He knows.

9156
05:55:06,660 --> 05:55:07,080
He knows.

9157
05:55:07,340 --> 05:55:08,940
Hey, you tried!

9158
05:55:09,080 --> 05:55:09,440
You tried!

9159
05:55:09,460 --> 05:55:10,380
We take those!

9160
05:55:10,380 --> 05:55:10,400
We take those!

9161
05:55:10,400 --> 05:55:11,620
I mean, you got the image out of that.

9162
05:55:11,660 --> 05:55:11,980
You're welcome.

9163
05:55:13,880 --> 05:55:14,320
Oh!

9164
05:55:14,320 --> 05:55:14,760
Oh!

9165
05:55:16,540 --> 05:55:17,480
With the bare feet, dude?

9166
05:55:17,560 --> 05:55:19,280
Should have let him RDC'd, bro!

9167
05:55:19,980 --> 05:55:21,360
Oh, we dodged that!

9168
05:55:21,480 --> 05:55:22,240
Oh, we dodged that!

9169
05:55:24,900 --> 05:55:25,740
Round three.

9170
05:55:25,820 --> 05:55:27,000
Oh my god, dude.

9171
05:55:27,160 --> 05:55:27,380
Fight!

9172
05:55:30,520 --> 05:55:32,800
Bro, he should have let you RDC'd.

9173
05:55:34,540 --> 05:55:35,940
I would have let it happen.

9174
05:55:36,300 --> 05:55:36,720
Yeah!

9175
05:55:36,740 --> 05:55:37,340
Finish it all!

9176
05:55:39,620 --> 05:55:41,580
It's okay, you don't need that Chipotle sponsor.

9177
05:55:42,200 --> 05:55:43,860
That is absurd!

9178
05:55:44,560 --> 05:55:45,380
Chip, dude.

9179
05:55:45,560 --> 05:55:46,340
That is crazy!

9180
05:55:46,540 --> 05:55:47,140
Oh my god!

9181
05:55:47,200 --> 05:55:48,300
Yeah, that's crazy.

9182
05:55:48,760 --> 05:55:49,260
Jesus, dude.

9183
05:55:49,340 --> 05:55:51,060
Round four.

9184
05:55:51,600 --> 05:55:52,680
One, two, three.

9185
05:55:53,780 --> 05:55:55,680
At least Ali could kick to the end.

9186
05:55:56,760 --> 05:55:57,540
Oh my god.

9187
05:55:57,780 --> 05:55:59,640
Oh, that was... What move was that?

9188
05:56:00,020 --> 05:56:02,120
How come he knew that, but he didn't teach the players?

9189
05:56:02,380 --> 05:56:02,680
Yeah!

9190
05:56:03,320 --> 05:56:05,140
He didn't teach nobody that.

9191
05:56:05,200 --> 05:56:06,440
He's saving it for Nationals.

9192
05:56:06,840 --> 05:56:08,780
Well, he just did a jump in like he's Ryu.

9193
05:56:09,320 --> 05:56:11,140
That was literally an anime fighter.

9194
05:56:11,220 --> 05:56:11,560
What the fuck?

9195
05:56:11,720 --> 05:56:13,420
What the fu- Oh my god!

9196
05:56:13,480 --> 05:56:13,920
Ali kick!

9197
05:56:14,060 --> 05:56:14,500
Ali kick!

9198
05:56:14,580 --> 05:56:15,420
Ali kick!

9199
05:56:15,420 --> 05:56:15,440
Ali kick!

9200
05:56:15,640 --> 05:56:15,900
Ali kick!

9201
05:56:17,700 --> 05:56:18,620
He's dead.

9202
05:56:19,020 --> 05:56:19,620
Goodbye!

9203
05:56:22,480 --> 05:56:23,080
Sayonara!

9204
05:56:23,460 --> 05:56:24,340
I'm in the cop car!

9205
05:56:24,620 --> 05:56:25,940
Take him away, boys!

9206
05:56:27,720 --> 05:56:28,600
Well done.

9207
05:56:29,000 --> 05:56:30,760
We dominated, everyone.

9208
05:56:31,060 --> 05:56:31,660
We win.

9209
05:56:31,760 --> 05:56:32,400
We're the best.

9210
05:56:32,400 --> 05:56:33,020
We're the ghosts.

9211
05:56:33,040 --> 05:56:33,680
Best team.

9212
05:56:34,380 --> 05:56:35,380
Best team.

9213
05:56:35,420 --> 05:56:36,060
Best vibes.

9214
05:56:36,460 --> 05:56:38,740
Best fan art.

9215
05:56:38,840 --> 05:56:39,540
Best fan art.

9216
05:56:39,620 --> 05:56:40,560
Best fan art.

9217
05:56:40,600 --> 05:56:41,400
Best fans.

9218
05:56:41,400 --> 05:56:42,160
Best team.

9219
05:56:44,440 --> 05:56:45,000
Best fan art.

9220
05:56:45,000 --> 05:56:45,000
Best fans.

9221
05:56:45,000 --> 05:56:45,880
We actually did it, guys.

9222
05:56:46,180 --> 05:56:49,760
We didn't have to go to the coach's match for the tiebreaker.

9223
05:56:50,560 --> 05:56:51,720
Tech kid ball.

9224
05:56:51,900 --> 05:56:52,720
Tech kid ball.

9225
05:56:53,020 --> 05:56:54,300
Tech kid ball.

9226
05:56:54,300 --> 05:56:55,620
Tech kid ball.

9227
05:56:55,780 --> 05:56:57,060
World Finals.

9228
05:56:59,740 --> 05:57:00,300
Woo!

9229
05:57:00,500 --> 05:57:01,240
Good shit, guys.

9230
05:57:03,080 --> 05:57:03,820
GG's, everybody.

9231
05:57:03,820 --> 05:57:04,660
We fucking did it, man!

9232
05:57:04,960 --> 05:57:06,140
We fucking did it!

9233
05:57:06,180 --> 05:57:07,920
We got first place!

9234
05:57:07,980 --> 05:57:08,860
I love you guys, dude!

9235
05:57:09,060 --> 05:57:09,520
Seriously!

9236
05:57:10,300 --> 05:57:11,360
Unbelievable, man.

9237
05:57:12,160 --> 05:57:15,180
I want the ghost of Super to come, like, Anakin's dad.

9238
05:57:15,460 --> 05:57:17,580
I'm gonna go on Super Chat and be like, guess what?

9239
05:57:17,660 --> 05:57:18,120
We got first.

9240
05:57:22,760 --> 05:57:23,920
Unbelievable, man.

9241
05:57:24,580 --> 05:57:25,540
Good shit, guys.

9242
05:57:25,660 --> 05:57:26,260
Straight up.

9243
05:57:26,500 --> 05:57:26,940
Wow.

9244
05:57:27,520 --> 05:57:28,720
Oh my god.

9245
05:57:28,820 --> 05:57:30,400
We got little Sayjam controllers again.

9246
05:57:30,820 --> 05:57:31,220
Yeah!

9247
05:57:31,220 --> 05:57:35,180
We got the first place ones this time.

9248
05:57:35,960 --> 05:57:36,400
Yeah, look at that.

9249
05:57:36,400 --> 05:57:37,120
True, bro!

9250
05:57:37,200 --> 05:57:38,060
We got two controllers!

9251
05:57:38,520 --> 05:57:38,960
Wait!

9252
05:57:39,780 --> 05:57:40,760
Oh my god.

9253
05:57:41,180 --> 05:57:43,500
My chat is saying, all five of you raid Super.

9254
05:57:44,920 --> 05:57:45,440
No.

9255
05:57:45,440 --> 05:57:45,960
No.

9256
05:57:46,020 --> 05:57:47,420
That would be really funny.

9257
05:57:49,120 --> 05:57:50,580
Hey, Lil Bro, where were you?

9258
05:57:51,660 --> 05:57:52,500
Why were...

9259
05:57:52,500 --> 05:57:54,720
I... Weren't you training SK earlier?

9260
05:57:56,020 --> 05:57:56,800
Oh, true.

9261
05:58:01,020 --> 05:58:02,160
Oh my god.

9262
05:58:02,940 --> 05:58:03,820
GG's, guys.

9263
05:58:05,340 --> 05:58:05,860
GG's.

9264
05:58:05,940 --> 05:58:07,200
First fucking place.

9265
05:58:07,740 --> 05:58:10,400
Team Brawl Pro continues to be on top, no matter what.

9266
05:58:11,600 --> 05:58:14,560
No one expected us to take it to the first.

9267
05:58:14,860 --> 05:58:15,580
But here we are.

9268
05:58:17,360 --> 05:58:20,700
Dude, Tony's team, because they beat us 4-1, right?

9269
05:58:21,000 --> 05:58:21,400
Yeah.

9270
05:58:22,100 --> 05:58:23,000
It was bad.

9271
05:58:23,120 --> 05:58:23,920
It was brutal.

9272
05:58:24,060 --> 05:58:26,960
But you guys put in so much freaking work, man.

9273
05:58:27,340 --> 05:58:29,280
Yeah, we literally put them on tilt, too.

9274
05:58:29,580 --> 05:58:29,860
Yeah!

9275
05:58:30,700 --> 05:58:33,260
We put them on tilt so we get the free PDX win.

9276
05:58:33,440 --> 05:58:34,980
No offense, but let's be honest.

9277
05:58:36,920 --> 05:58:37,660
Let's be honest.

9278
05:58:37,720 --> 05:58:38,600
That shit was kind of easy.

9279
05:58:39,720 --> 05:58:40,700
No, well, I mean, look.

9280
05:58:40,760 --> 05:58:41,760
Feng Wei...

9281
05:58:41,760 --> 05:58:42,380
No, no.

9282
05:58:42,380 --> 05:58:43,560
Your seed is fucked.

9283
05:58:43,640 --> 05:58:45,000
Honestly, like, I don't blame you.

9284
05:58:45,260 --> 05:58:46,180
Dude, yeah.

9285
05:58:46,260 --> 05:58:48,140
You had Roy, you had that Feng player.

9286
05:58:48,360 --> 05:58:51,700
You had your roommate, your best friend, whatever.

9287
05:58:52,100 --> 05:58:53,480
That shit was fucked up, dude.

9288
05:58:53,740 --> 05:58:55,780
Yeah, the third seed was literally fucked up.

9289
05:58:55,860 --> 05:58:57,360
Like, it was insane.

9290
05:58:57,740 --> 05:58:59,520
Not a you issue, genuinely.

9291
05:59:00,820 --> 05:59:01,980
We did it, bro.

9292
05:59:02,160 --> 05:59:03,660
Well, I...

9293
05:59:03,660 --> 05:59:07,620
Yeah, I'm actually gonna... Well, they said that you can stay in the Discord and we're gonna hang out, so...

9294
05:59:07,620 --> 05:59:08,440
I would stay in the Discord.

9295
05:59:08,580 --> 05:59:09,500
Yeah, you know how...

9296
05:59:09,720 --> 05:59:12,360
late night in the Discord, people are hanging out and playing better?

9297
05:59:12,780 --> 05:59:13,320
Oh, really?

9298
05:59:13,920 --> 05:59:17,060
Yeah, come check out the Discord, because we literally just sit and we just talk.

9299
05:59:17,160 --> 05:59:18,000
Like, everyone comes in.

9300
05:59:18,260 --> 05:59:19,500
Oh, that sounds neat.

9301
05:59:19,960 --> 05:59:21,020
I'll probably pop in.

9302
05:59:21,100 --> 05:59:21,820
I'm hungry, bro.

9303
05:59:22,000 --> 05:59:22,800
Yeah, I got it.

9304
05:59:22,960 --> 05:59:25,900
I'm gonna fucking smoke a doobie and then get some Jack in the Box.

9305
05:59:26,140 --> 05:59:27,100
Good fucking night.

9306
05:59:27,120 --> 05:59:27,260
You earned it, bro.

9307
05:59:27,400 --> 05:59:28,180
You earned it.

9308
05:59:29,080 --> 05:59:30,180
That's an American reset.

9309
05:59:31,060 --> 05:59:31,540
I'm actually...

9310
05:59:31,540 --> 05:59:33,240
I'm literally American resetting my brain right now.

9311
05:59:33,240 --> 05:59:33,440
You earned it, man.

9312
05:59:33,440 --> 05:59:34,680
Six hours of Tekken.

9313
05:59:34,780 --> 05:59:35,980
You deserve it, man.

9314
05:59:36,540 --> 05:59:37,200
You all...

9315
05:59:37,880 --> 05:59:39,500
You're all fucking amazing, GG.

9316
05:59:39,640 --> 05:59:40,660
I could not ask for a better team.

9317
05:59:40,780 --> 05:59:41,360
Once again.

9318
05:59:41,860 --> 05:59:42,260
Unbelievable.

9319
05:59:43,020 --> 05:59:43,740
GG's, everybody.

9320
05:59:43,900 --> 05:59:45,100
Have a great time.

9321
05:59:45,700 --> 05:59:46,540
I'm so happy to be part of the team.

9322
05:59:46,540 --> 05:59:47,620
I'll see you guys at EVO, man!

9323
05:59:47,800 --> 05:59:48,060
Yeah!

9324
05:59:48,880 --> 05:59:50,020
Let's get fucking food!

9325
05:59:50,260 --> 05:59:51,020
Good shit, guys.

9326
05:59:51,140 --> 05:59:51,760
Good shit.

9327
05:59:52,160 --> 05:59:52,820
See you guys.

9328
05:59:53,360 --> 05:59:54,740
We gotta... Oh, god.

9329
05:59:54,840 --> 05:59:55,500
I'm sad it's over.

9330
05:59:55,620 --> 05:59:56,400
Over the school year.

9331
05:59:56,960 --> 05:59:57,680
Stay in touch.

9332
05:59:57,780 --> 05:59:58,660
It's so sad, man!

9333
05:59:58,840 --> 05:59:59,580
Alright, alright.

9334
06:00:00,200 --> 06:00:01,600
Next stage at Slam, guys.

9335
06:00:01,800 --> 06:00:02,360
Street Fighter.

9336
06:00:02,460 --> 06:00:03,760
We all get together again.

9337
06:00:05,220 --> 06:00:05,880
I'm in there.

9338
06:00:05,940 --> 06:00:06,840
I'll med train that shit.

9339
06:00:07,200 --> 06:00:07,460
For sure.

9340
06:00:07,800 --> 06:00:08,320
Same.

9341
06:00:08,440 --> 06:00:09,140
Same, dude.

9342
06:00:09,800 --> 06:00:11,120
Alright, I'll see you later, guys.

9343
06:00:11,160 --> 06:00:11,940
Alright, bye, guys.

9344
06:00:12,320 --> 06:00:13,000
Bye-bye.

9345
06:00:13,140 --> 06:00:13,340
Bye -bye.

9346
06:00:13,480 --> 06:00:14,660
See you at Slam.

9347
06:00:15,200 --> 06:00:17,200
Oh, my god!

9348
06:00:17,400 --> 06:00:31,850
I... Honestly, I did not expect to win against SK because SK won against ESAM and then I did not know what the fuck ESAM was...

9349
06:00:31,850 --> 06:00:33,610
I was doing with ESAM.

9350
06:00:33,810 --> 06:00:36,030
So, I was so surprised.

9351
06:00:36,130 --> 06:00:38,670
I can't believe I won against SK.

9352
06:00:41,090 --> 06:00:41,870
I told...

9353
06:00:41,870 --> 06:00:42,970
Guys, I told you.

9354
06:00:43,010 --> 06:00:44,910
All I needed to do was just not think.

9355
06:00:45,030 --> 06:00:48,150
The moment I stopped thinking, like, it works.

9356
06:00:48,250 --> 06:00:49,030
It just works.

9357
06:00:49,330 --> 06:00:50,430
My brain...

9358
06:00:50,430 --> 06:00:52,150
I don't know what... I don't know what I'm doing.

9359
06:00:52,350 --> 06:00:54,030
She doesn't know what I'm doing.

9360
06:00:54,250 --> 06:00:55,390
So, she's confused.

9361
06:00:55,810 --> 06:00:57,130
And I'm confused.

9362
06:00:57,470 --> 06:00:58,810
And then I won!

9363
06:01:03,030 --> 06:01:04,350
Oh, my god!

9364
06:01:04,830 --> 06:01:05,290
Oh, my god!

9365
06:01:05,290 --> 06:01:05,290
Oh, my god!

9366
06:01:05,290 --> 06:01:06,410
I can't believe it!

9367
06:01:06,450 --> 06:01:07,330
We clutched it!

9368
06:01:07,370 --> 06:01:08,170
That's the one that matters!

9369
06:01:08,630 --> 06:01:13,050
We might have lost the other games today, but we won the finals match.

9370
06:01:13,410 --> 06:01:18,550
Which matters the most, because that meant Brawl Pro didn't have to do the final coaching fight.

9371
06:01:22,350 --> 06:01:25,590
Once I relaxed, I started... I started fucking.

9372
06:01:28,730 --> 06:01:29,890
Oh, my god!

9373
06:01:30,190 --> 06:01:31,330
I'm so happy!

9374
06:01:31,950 --> 06:01:33,810
I'm so, so, so happy, guys!

9375
06:01:33,910 --> 06:01:35,450
I'm really happy with this team.

9376
06:01:35,450 --> 06:01:38,230
It was... it was such a great team.

9377
06:01:38,530 --> 06:01:43,710
Brawl Pro was actually... despite how much we roast Brawl Pro, it was a great coach.

9378
06:01:44,430 --> 06:01:47,110
He taught me those six moves.

9379
06:01:47,270 --> 06:01:51,190
The six most important moves ever to get me here.

9380
06:01:55,650 --> 06:02:01,110
If it weren't for those six moves and that alley kick, I would not have been here.

9381
06:02:03,950 --> 06:02:06,310
Thank you, guys, for cheering us on!

9382
06:02:06,610 --> 06:02:08,810
I'll miss this team, honestly.

9383
06:02:09,130 --> 06:02:10,750
This was such a great team.

9384
06:02:10,810 --> 06:02:12,170
I love this team so much.

9385
06:02:12,570 --> 06:02:15,710
I couldn't have asked for a better group of people to vibe with.

9386
06:02:17,570 --> 06:02:20,170
Honestly, thank you guys for cheering us on.

9387
06:02:20,290 --> 06:02:22,370
What a fucking arc for me.

9388
06:02:22,570 --> 06:02:24,510
Fighting game arc we had there.

9389
06:02:25,230 --> 06:02:30,830
The fact that we went from zero fighting game experience with only like 50 hours played.

9390
06:02:31,810 --> 06:02:34,030
Started off... started training late.

9391
06:02:34,090 --> 06:02:35,350
Later than all the others.

9392
06:02:35,450 --> 06:02:37,210
Gamers that were on.

9393
06:02:37,730 --> 06:02:40,410
All the other gamers that were in my seed.

9394
06:02:40,510 --> 06:02:41,150
I trained...

9395
06:02:41,150 --> 06:02:42,890
I started training a week late.

9396
06:02:43,190 --> 06:02:44,550
Because I was so busy.

9397
06:02:46,070 --> 06:02:46,670
So...

9398
06:02:47,330 --> 06:02:54,270
And then had the... and then had the fucked up PC until I fixed it the last day.

9399
06:02:57,110 --> 06:03:03,290
My PC was so fucked until I fixed it today for just this tournament.

9400
06:03:03,630 --> 06:03:05,430
And we managed to...

9401
06:03:05,450 --> 06:03:06,070
clutch it.

9402
06:03:06,150 --> 06:03:07,110
I'm so happy.

9403
06:03:07,230 --> 06:03:08,250
I'm really, really happy.

9404
06:03:08,910 --> 06:03:09,710
But yes!

9405
06:03:09,790 --> 06:03:10,570
Thank you everybody.

9406
06:03:10,790 --> 06:03:11,690
I'm gonna rest now.

9407
06:03:11,750 --> 06:03:12,710
Haven't had dinner yet.

9408
06:03:12,950 --> 06:03:14,890
And we trained for six hours.

9409
06:03:15,030 --> 06:03:17,330
And we grind... we played Tekken for six hours.

9410
06:03:17,510 --> 06:03:20,430
And I trained yesterday for so long too.

9411
06:03:20,710 --> 06:03:22,990
I mean I got... I ranked up last night.

9412
06:03:23,070 --> 06:03:25,090
Cause I was just training and rank.

9413
06:03:25,390 --> 06:03:28,030
And I'm just so happy it's over.

9414
06:03:28,510 --> 06:03:30,210
Thank you everybody for watching!

9415
06:03:30,470 --> 06:03:32,710
As always everyone stay hydrated.

9416
06:03:33,010 --> 06:03:33,630
Posture check.

9417
06:03:33,670 --> 06:03:35,350
Get up and move around to get that blood flow.

9418
06:03:35,450 --> 06:03:37,490
And if you did that for me, head to bed.

9419
06:03:37,590 --> 06:03:38,770
Cause you deserve it!

9420
06:03:38,870 --> 06:03:40,090
I'll see you guys next time everybody!

9421
06:03:40,970 --> 06:03:41,710
Bye guys!

9422
06:03:42,810 --> 06:03:43,210
Bye!
