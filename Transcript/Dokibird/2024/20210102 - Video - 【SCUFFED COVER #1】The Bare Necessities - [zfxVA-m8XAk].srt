1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,460
But um...

2
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:12,670
So, if you guys do not know, for those new here, I am not a singer.

3
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:14,390
I am a terrible singer.

4
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:22,030
This is like a little warning, a little disclaimer for those of you who don't want to have their ears bleed out.

5
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:29,610
I am not very good at singing, but this year, my resolution, I'm starting singing lessons this year.

6
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:30,690
Let's go.

7
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:06,170
It's jazz time guys.

8
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:10,490
It's time to jazz.

9
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:38,910
Wherever I roam, I couldn't be fonder of my big home.

10
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:44,550
The bees are buzzing in the trees to make some honey just for me.

11
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:49,730
Then you look under the rocks and plants and take a glance at a fancy ant.

12
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:51,710
Then maybe try a few.

13
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:04,370
The bare necessities of life will come to you.

14
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:06,630
They'll come to you.

15
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:08,610
Look for them.

16
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:10,610
The bare necessities.

17
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:12,930
The simple bare necessities.

18
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:16,090
Forget about your worries and your strife.

19
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:19,870
I mean the bare necessities.

20
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:22,350
That's why a bare can rest at ease.

21
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:25,350
With just the bare necessities of life.

22
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:34,930
Now when you pick a paw paw, or a prickly pear, and you prick a raw paw, well next time, beware.

23
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:38,070
Don't pick the prickly pear by the paw.

24
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:40,290
When you pick a pear, try to use the claw.

25
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:45,630
But you don't need to use the claw when you pick a pear with a big paw paw.

26
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,650
Have I given you a clue?

27
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:49,390
I don't even know what the fuck I'm saying.

28
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:00,280
The bare necessities of life will come to you.

29
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,620
They'll come to you.

30
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,540
Yo, it's jazz!

31
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,800
Jazz solo!

32
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:13,100
Buh dum buh dum buh dum.

33
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,860
Buh dum buh dum.

34
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,340
Oh shit!

35
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:24,460
Maracas time!

36
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:31,030
Woo!

37
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:33,870
Maracas!

38
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:35,950
I'm jazzing!

39
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:41,540
Oh!

40
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,120
I'm jazzing!

41
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:03,140
Oh man, this is really living.

42
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,460
So...

43
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,660
Try and relax.

44
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:09,800
Yeah...

45
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,560
Cool it.

46
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:14,760
Fall apart in my backyard.

47
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:18,700
Cause let me tell you something, little britches.

48
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:21,820
If you act like that bee's acting, uh uh.

49
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,240
You're working too hard.

50
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,900
And don't spend your time looking around...

51
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,260
for something you want...

52
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:33,260
that can be found.

53
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,180
When you find out...

54
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:38,040
you can live without and go along.

55
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:41,200
Not thinking about and tell you something true.

56
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,980
The bare necessities of life will come to you.

57
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:48,260
Woo!

58
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,940
Look for the bare necessities.

59
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,340
The simple life.

60
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:58,900
Bare necessities.

61
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,400
Forget about your worries and your strife.

62
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,160
I mean the bare necessities.

63
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:08,640
That's why a bear can rest at ease.

64
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,700
With just the bare necessities of life.

65
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:16,320
With just the bare necessities of life.

66
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:17,700
Woo!

67
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,040
Woo!

68
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:20,660
Jazz!

69
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,440
And that's how you jazz guys.

70
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,400
That's how you fucking jazz.

71
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,220
Alright, that's why I told you guys.

72
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,080
I'm very bad at singing.

73
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,360
That is...

74
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,320
This is the first song.

75
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,320
The first song of the...

76
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,460
of the year.

77
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,880
And we're not gonna have a song...

78
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,380
until I get better at singing.

79
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:43,920
Thank you everyone.

80
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:45,380
We're listening.

81
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:45,820
Hahaha!

82
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,580
Thank you desktop.

83
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:47,420
Sh
