1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,180
but um so

2
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:17,990
you guys do not know um for those new here i am not a singer
i'm a terrible singer uh this is like a little warning a

3
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:24,590
little disclaimer for those of you who don't want to you
know have their ears bleed blight out uh i am not very good

4
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:31,250
at singing but this year my resolution i'm starting singing
lessons this year let's go

5
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:06,570
It's jazz time, guys.

6
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:10,950
It's time to jazz.

7
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:17,250
Look for the bare necessities, the simple bare necessities.

8
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:20,330
Forget about your worries and your strife.

9
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:29,630
I mean the bare necessities, old Mother Nature's recipes
that bring the bare necessities of life.

10
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:44,090
I wonder wherever I roam I couldn't be fonder of my big home
the bees are buzzing in the trees to make some honey just

11
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:55,810
for me then you look under the rocks and plants and take a
glance at a fancy ants then maybe try a few the

12
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:04,850
bare necessities of life will come to you.

13
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:07,590
They'll come to you.

14
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:13,130
Look for the bare necessities, the simple bare necessities.

15
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:16,210
Forget about your worries and your strides.

16
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:20,050
I mean the bare necessities.

17
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:25,510
That's why a bear can rest at ease with just the bare
necessities of life.

18
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:35,250
Now when you pick a paw-paw, or a prickly pear, and you
prick a raw paw, well next time beware.

19
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:40,490
Don't pick the prickly pear by the paw when you pick a pear
try to use the claw.

20
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:45,850
But you don't need to use the claw when you pick a pair of
the big paw-paw.

21
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:47,770
Have I given you a clue?

22
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:49,650
I don't even know what the fuck I'm seeing!

23
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,360
They'll come to you.

24
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,220
They'll come to you.

25
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:05,620
Yo!

26
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,020
It's jazz!

27
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,400
Boo!

28
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,140
Jazz solo!

29
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,980
Ba-da-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.

30
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,980
Ba-da-ba-ba.

31
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,580
Oh shit!

32
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,900
Maracas time!

33
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:26,960
Oh!

34
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:33,550
Maracas!

35
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:36,250
I'm jazzing!

36
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:37,150
I'm jazzing!

37
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,360
Oh, I'm jazzing!

38
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:01,820
Oh, man.

39
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,320
This is really living.

40
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:08,160
So, just try and relax.

41
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:09,740
Yeah.

42
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,860
Cool it.

43
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:15,060
Fall apart in my backyard.

44
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,820
Because let me tell you something, little britches.

45
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:22,000
If you act like that bees act, uh-uh.

46
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,500
You're working too hard.

47
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:37,880
spend your time looking around for something you want that
can be found when you find out you can live about and go

48
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:48,040
along not thinking about it and tell you something true the
bare necessities of life will come to you

49
00:04:51,520 --> 00:05:02,520
look for the bare necessities the simple life bare
necessities for about your worries and your strife.

50
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,340
I mean the bare necessities.

51
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,880
That's why a bear can rest at ease.

52
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:12,300
But just the bare necessities of life.

53
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,900
With just the bare necessities of life.

54
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,120
Woo!

55
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:20,800
Jazz!

56
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,780
And that's how you jazz, guys.

57
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,620
That's how you fucking jazz.

58
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,300
Alright, that's why I told you guys.

59
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,240
I'm very bad at singing.

60
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:35,640
That is, this is the first song, the first song of the year.

61
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:39,700
And we're not going to have a song until I get better at
singing.

62
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,360
Thank you, everyone.

63
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,580
We're listening.
