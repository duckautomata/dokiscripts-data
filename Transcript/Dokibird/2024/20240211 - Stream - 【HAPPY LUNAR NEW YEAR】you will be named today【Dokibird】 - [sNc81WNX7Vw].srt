1
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:53,010
Oh my god!

2
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:54,290
Hello everybody!

3
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:56,650
Happy Lunar New Year!

4
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:58,890
Woo!

5
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:06,670
Three streams and she still hasn't gamed yet for winning gamer of the year.

6
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:09,710
She still hasn't done any gaming.

7
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:17,670
We are on Day 3 of... Ok, not Day 3... This is like, Day 4?

8
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:18,910
Day 5?

9
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:19,830
Day 5.

10
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:20,830
Day 5?

11
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:22,530
I fucking lost count.

12
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:24,930
But three streams, still no gaming.

13
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:26,990
Still no gaming.

14
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:28,390
Don't worry!

15
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:30,170
That's gonna be next week.

16
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:32,070
That will be next week, guys.

17
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:35,450
I have my schedule all fully planned out.

18
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:39,130
We will be gaming for real next week.

19
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:39,690
But...

20
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:41,110
But yes, Happy Lunar New Year!

21
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,670
恭喜發財!大家帶來身體健康!

22
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:45,730
恭喜發財!

23
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:48,550
But yeah!

24
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,710
Oh my gosh, I swear to God.

25
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:51,050
Okay.

26
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:59,710
I feel like I've been like speedrunning VTuber prep in six days.

27
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:05,250
Like this, all of this would be like, you know, three to four months of prep time.

28
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:09,710
And I'm trying to get everything done in under a week.

29
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:12,610
Like I'm already uploading shorts.

30
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:15,190
I have a TikTok account now.

31
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:20,510
I got my old thumbnail maker, making thumbnails and stuff.

32
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:25,890
I'm... oh my God, like every day is just like, alright, gotta do...

33
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:28,570
Here's a list of things I can do this time.

34
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:32,030
Here's a list of things I can do on the other day.

35
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:34,590
And then today I like...

36
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:35,230
I like woke up.

37
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:40,010
I like woke up at like six in the morning.

38
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:41,990
I was like, alright, I can do this.

39
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:46,570
I can stay up all the way till my stream time.

40
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:48,990
And then I was doing work.

41
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:53,410
I was doing work all the way till like 12 p.m.

42
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:55,950
And then... and then I was like, I'm EP.

43
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,570
I was just like, oh no.

44
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:01,530
How am I tired already?

45
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:04,690
Oh, oh no.

46
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:06,030
This is not good.

47
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:09,530
So then... so then I was like, okay, okay.

48
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:12,750
I will take... I will take a one hour...

49
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:13,470
Sorry, like...

50
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:19,430
My... okay, I have my giant ass fucking tablet in front of me.

51
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:23,230
So like tracking wise is not... not so great right now.

52
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:26,390
My mouth be a little bit laggy today.

53
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:28,490
Okay.

54
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:31,690
So like I was like, okay, I'll take an one hour nap.

55
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:34,670
Well, guess who woke up at four?

56
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:35,490
4.30.

57
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:38,970
Also, yes.

58
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:42,970
I almost said the wrong name.

59
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:44,290
Memberships.

60
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:48,590
I was like hesitating because like it's... it's so ingrained.

61
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:51,570
Because I've been saying this other word for three years.

62
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:52,730
Almost three years.

63
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:55,690
I was like, wait, no, that's not what it's called now.

64
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:58,150
That is not what it's called now.

65
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:01,090
But yes, memberships are open now.

66
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:03,670
Welcome to the tomato farm.

67
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:04,430
Yeah.

68
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:10,570
I've only... I grabbed that sub-batch of tomatoes from an artist.

69
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:11,390
I retweeted the artist.

70
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:13,250
I don't have it pulled up at the moment.

71
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:13,890
But...

72
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:18,210
But shout out to that artist for the tomato batch.

73
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:19,190
I have no idea.

74
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:21,510
All of these are like placeholders right now.

75
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:27,330
Because like I'm gonna be having a new mama not very soon.

76
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:28,190
So...

77
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:33,650
So like I don't even know what like my new skin suit's gonna look like.

78
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:37,590
You know, when I shed out this old skin suit and hop into the other one.

79
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,310
I have no idea.

80
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:43,550
Like there's no... no plan going on inside right now.

81
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:47,830
So like all we know is that deep within all of us there's a tomato.

82
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:50,310
And I was like, that's the safest thing.

83
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:55,130
Because... and that's why there's all like placeholder emotes as well.

84
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:59,530
Because I... I don't wanna like commission all these emotes.

85
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:03,010
And then like be like, okay, can you retry?

86
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:04,090
Can you retry all of these later?

87
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:08,030
Can you... I'll just be like, okay, um...

88
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:10,210
Can you like, um...

89
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:14,130
Redraw all of these for my new... new skin suit?

90
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:17,170
And then... so that would be very fucking awkward.

91
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:18,770
So I was like...

92
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:23,030
So like for now, we're just gonna have a bunch of placeholder emotes.

93
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:27,490
I'll just be like, I don't know, I'll just MS Paint some fucking placeholder emotes for all of us.

94
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:28,990
Um...

95
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:31,990
It might be just like all different pictures of like...

96
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:33,650
Doki Amber Doge there.

97
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:35,330
Uh... our resident dad.

98
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:36,630
So like...

99
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:40,310
I'll just be like Photoshop pictures of dad.

100
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:42,570
Also thank you all for the super chats!

101
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:44,390
Thank you for all the Akas and Magentas!

102
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,350
Thank you and all the other colors!

103
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:49,530
Um... Blue, I think, is one of them.

104
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,550
Um... but thank you everybody.

105
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:53,230
I really, really do appreciate it.

106
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:53,530
Thank you.

107
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:55,550
I hope you guys have a good Lunar New Year, guys.

108
00:06:56,130 --> 00:07:00,090
Um... I feel a little bad because like I was supposed to have...

109
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:05,310
A... uh... you know, a traditional like, you know, Lunar New Year like lunch...

110
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:06,830
Uh... with my parents.

111
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:08,970
But then I passed out at 12!

112
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:10,830
So they're like, well...

113
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:11,870
I guess...

114
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:14,370
Will happen another day!

115
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:16,030
And I'm like, oops!

116
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:16,890
I'm sorry.

117
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:18,730
I was so fucking... I was so tired.

118
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:21,290
I didn't even... I just felt like I didn't like...

119
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:22,390
I didn't like...

120
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:25,270
I like slept in... I felt like I slept enough.

121
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:26,790
I did not stay up at all.

122
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:30,070
I like went to bed at like fucking 10 PM or some shit.

123
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:33,090
And it was just like... I'm... I'm just... I just died.

124
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:37,290
I'll just... I'll just fucking sleep, I guess.

125
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:40,050
And I'm like, why am I so fucking tired?

126
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:40,870
I'm still...

127
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:42,610
Oh my god!

128
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:43,130
I don't know.

129
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:46,390
I guess it's like I'm not used to streaming anymore.

130
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:50,250
I'm not... I... I'm just like not used to streaming.

131
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:52,070
So like my energy...

132
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:53,530
Look...

133
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:56,310
During that past month and a half...

134
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,330
Or like month...

135
00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:00,050
I would just like play video games...

136
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:00,870
And stuff...

137
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:01,930
And I won't talk...

138
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:03,050
I really talk to people.

139
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:03,610
Like...

140
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:04,030
I...

141
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:06,350
Like even when I played games with my friends...

142
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:08,490
Like I didn't really talk a lot.

143
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:10,670
I would just be like...

144
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:11,530
Like...

145
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:14,090
I guess we would have like sort of a conversation.

146
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:16,090
But like I was mostly like...

147
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:18,270
Hibernation mode for most of it.

148
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:21,750
So like I was not ready to like talk.

149
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:22,990
And...

150
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:23,790
And like okay...

151
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:24,750
And also I was like...

152
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:25,350
You know...

153
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:29,350
Super fucking low energy when I'm talking to people.

154
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:31,370
Because I was just like...

155
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:33,890
Super low energy when I'm talking to people.

156
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:35,430
So I was just not ready.

157
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:39,930
I was not ready in life to like use all my energy here.

158
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:41,130
Um...

159
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:42,070
But yeah...

160
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:43,070
Anyway...

161
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:43,750
Anyway...

162
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,830
Today is the day...

163
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:48,870
We will name all of you.

164
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:52,150
And you will finally have a name.

165
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:55,190
And you will have a form.

166
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:57,210
So today is the day.

167
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,210
It will be the day...

168
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:02,130
You guys will finally not be nameless.

169
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:03,070
Uh...

170
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:06,090
No more arguing about what kind of name...

171
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:08,810
Oh I forgot to change the gifting fucking picture.

172
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:09,530
God damn...

173
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:09,830
Okay...

174
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:14,610
I knew I forgot to do something.

175
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:15,750
Um...

176
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:16,710
And we will...

177
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:20,610
You will finally have some fucking form to all of you.

178
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:21,710
But for now...

179
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:22,410
Not yet though.

180
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:22,990
Not yet.

181
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:24,470
We will get to that later.

182
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:25,590
We will get to that later.

183
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:26,490
Um...

184
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:28,170
We are not one name.

185
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:30,790
I am absolutely vetoing...

186
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:32,030
Is Freebirds.

187
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:33,710
Cause fuck that song.

188
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:37,970
It's a good song.

189
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:39,470
I will admit.

190
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:41,170
It's a good song.

191
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:44,770
But fuck that song for demonetizing my...

192
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:45,850
I like how like...

193
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:47,130
Before I was like...

194
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:47,470
Oh...

195
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:49,180
I don't care if it demonetize...

196
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:51,070
It's not even monetize.

197
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:53,170
And then I got monetize.

198
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:53,910
And I'm like...

199
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:54,510
Oh...

200
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:56,790
That's awkward.

201
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:00,790
But it's like...

202
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:01,270
I'm not even monetize.

203
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:01,570
Yeah...

204
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:02,670
I don't have to worry.

205
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:04,010
I won't even...

206
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:05,430
I'm not even monetize.

207
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:06,370
Well...

208
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:08,630
Joke's on you dokey.

209
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:11,750
You got monetize right after.

210
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:15,210
Oh my god...

211
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:15,530
Okay.

212
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:18,650
You know like the sudden realization that I had.

213
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:19,950
Um...

214
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:26,550
I had like a sudden realization today because if you guys didn't know.

215
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:27,670
Uh...

216
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:28,150
Wonder Woman.

217
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:32,230
Wonderfest is going on right now!

218
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:34,450
And then some of you guys are like, wait, what's Wonderfest?

219
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:42,870
And well, Wonderfest is basically like the, you know, all the Nendoroids and the Good Smile Company, shit like that.

220
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:50,550
It's like they're showcasing all the new products that they're releasing.

221
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:54,650
And I... did you guys know that?

222
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:57,130
I did not know this.

223
00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:03,430
But they're gonna be releasing Freddy Fazbear Nendoroid.

224
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:11,290
And then I realized, I was like, wait a minute, I can actually show that on stream!

225
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:18,050
I was like, oh my god!

226
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:21,350
Whatever I talk about...

227
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:22,090
I can actually show that on stream!

228
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:22,090
I was like, oh my god!

229
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:22,090
Whatever I talk about...

230
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:25,030
I can actually show that on stream!

231
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:28,950
I can show the picture on stream!

232
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,050
It blew my mind!

233
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:34,830
I was like, I don't have to link the images anymore!

234
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:38,590
Or be like, alright, just Google it.

235
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:41,770
I can actually show it on stream!

236
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:44,110
Oh my god!

237
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:44,990
Anyway...

238
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:47,430
Oh my god, I need to show you guys this.

239
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:48,790
I knew I downloaded it.

240
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:51,970
I was like, where the fuck did I download this picture of Freddy?

241
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:54,110
Freddy Fazbear Nendoroid.

242
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:56,150
I was like, where is it?

243
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:57,210
Oh my god, look at this.

244
00:11:57,890 --> 00:11:59,630
Look... oh my god!

245
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:06,110
I can't believe there's a Freddy... holy shit!

246
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:10,190
I can't believe there's a Freddy Faz...

247
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:13,870
Don't worry, this is transformative work right now.

248
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:18,710
So like, I can't put a picture of Freddy Fazbear next to me.

249
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:21,130
I was like... it just makes me wonder, like...

250
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:24,590
What are the interchangeable faceplates to?

251
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:25,970
Like, wait!

252
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:27,630
Does that mean I can put like...

253
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:30,990
You can put like a head of like...

254
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:33,490
You can put like the head of a different Nendoroid.

255
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:35,230
On top of Freddy Fazbear's head.

256
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:40,210
Like... you can put Freddy Fazbear's head on different Nendoroids!

257
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:41,370
Oh my gosh.

258
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:43,930
The possibilities are endless.

259
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:45,230
I was so surprised.

260
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:46,230
I did not realize.

261
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:50,150
I can't believe Freddy Fazbear has a fucking Nendoroid.

262
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:51,770
But yet he is not on Fortnite.

263
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:53,230
I'm so mad.

264
00:12:58,790 --> 00:12:59,970
We can do the...

265
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:01,450
We can do the bite of 87!

266
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:07,690
Oh my god.

267
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:09,150
I can't believe it though.

268
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:11,470
Where the fuck is my Freddy Fazbear on Fortnite?

269
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:17,890
Like, they have a Nendoroid but not like a fucking Freddy Fazbear on fucking Fortnite.

270
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:19,870
Just... it pisses me off.

271
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:21,850
It pisses me off.

272
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:25,410
But yes, thank you everyone again for the memberships.

273
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:26,690
I really do appreciate it.

274
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:29,670
For those who are wondering, who are new here that don't know...

275
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:34,890
Usually what entails in a membership...

276
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:38,630
Basically, membership streams will include like...

277
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:40,750
You know, like gaming with me.

278
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:45,890
So like I would open like servers and stuff where you guys can like play video games with me.

279
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:47,530
Like for example, I'm planning on...

280
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:50,130
For next week, we're going to be doing Garfield Kart next week.

281
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:52,570
So in the member stream.

282
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:56,990
And also like there will be like other types of gaming servers that I might host in the future.

283
00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:01,750
Like maybe a custom PAL World server or like custom Minecraft server.

284
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:07,330
Usually Minecraft server, I hope when I do get it established, I want to make that super long term.

285
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:13,550
Other servers tend to be short term because like in the past, I've done like one month of Rust.

286
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:18,610
Like a Rust server for members, like for one month and stuff like that.

287
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:19,630
So it really...

288
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:25,070
And then other things would be like, you know, like sometimes members get to decide like the schedule.

289
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:26,830
Or like they get to decide...

290
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:29,490
They get to vote on the schedule and stuff of what to do.

291
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:35,850
Also, I will be including like, you know, exclusive wallpapers that will be released in members.

292
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:41,410
And like, you know, like we used to do this thing called...

293
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:44,690
Okay, I used to call it like average movie watch alongs.

294
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:48,990
But now, now that I'm in indie, I can finally call it shitty...

295
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:55,670
Shitty slash bad movies watch alongs.

296
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:57,370
Now I can call them shit.

297
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:58,790
So now...

298
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:00,210
It will be like...

299
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:01,650
Sorry, bad movie...

300
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:07,310
Okay, shitty slash bad movies watch alongs in members.

301
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:08,890
So we can...

302
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:13,210
We usually do that as well.

303
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:14,690
So...

304
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:16,410
So...

305
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:19,470
We don't have to be like quote unquote average.

306
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:22,390
Now I can actually be like, no, they're actually terrible movies.

307
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:24,910
They're actually terrible movies.

308
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:26,370
So...

309
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:28,330
So...

310
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:33,610
So we can do like terrible like bad movie watch alongs.

311
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:34,850
And that's really it.

312
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:36,930
Like members is just like...

313
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:39,310
It's just a lot of like...

314
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:42,350
I think like the most fun part is like the bad movie watch alongs.

315
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:43,950
And also the like...

316
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:45,910
The gaming streams.

317
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:49,030
Like if I do like streams where I play video games.

318
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:49,890
With you guys.

319
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:52,330
It's usually reserved in members.

320
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:55,070
Unless it's like something like a...

321
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:59,470
Like an Apex server where there's like a lot of people or something like that.

322
00:15:59,590 --> 00:15:59,930
Like...

323
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:04,110
Like I think like the one time I made it public gaming was...

324
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:06,370
Was Apex or something.

325
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:07,390
I think that was the one time.

326
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:08,370
I don't remember.

327
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:09,030
So...

328
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:10,850
And there were a lot of streams blurred together.

329
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:13,270
But yeah.

330
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:14,810
Anyway, oh my gosh.

331
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:16,110
Little life update.

332
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:17,030
I contacted...

333
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:18,430
Um...

334
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:20,250
A Twitch staff today.

335
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:21,490
Um...

336
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:23,530
And I was so...

337
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:25,290
I was very like...

338
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:26,090
What's so weird?

339
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:27,470
I was very grateful.

340
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:28,730
Because...

341
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:31,510
The Twitch staff still loves me.

342
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:35,690
And he was like...

343
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:36,490
Oh yeah.

344
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:37,230
Yeah Doki.

345
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:39,410
If you still want to do like Twitch rivals.

346
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:41,430
Or like anything like that.

347
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:42,750
Like we will still support you.

348
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:45,050
And we will still invite you to Twitch rivals and stuff.

349
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:45,890
And like...

350
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:48,350
I think they thought that I signed like an exclusive...

351
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:50,330
Contract with YouTube.

352
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:51,170
Because they were like...

353
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:53,050
We thought you moved to YouTube forever.

354
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:54,150
I was like...

355
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:56,350
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

356
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:57,990
It's the same thing.

357
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:00,810
I like do YouTube and Twitch sometimes.

358
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:02,390
It's the same thing.

359
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:04,090
I'm just Doki now.

360
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:06,190
I'm just...

361
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:09,730
I was like...

362
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:10,790
No, no, no, no.

363
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:12,190
I'm just Doki.

364
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:13,690
That's the only thing different.

365
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:15,950
I'm just Doki now.

366
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:20,170
So yeah.

367
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:22,050
And then like the Twitch staff was like...

368
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:22,330
Yeah, yeah.

369
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:24,290
We have like this event actually coming up.

370
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:26,770
Obviously I can't say what the fuck the event is.

371
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:27,630
And they're like...

372
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:30,070
Yeah, we can like get you in on this next Twitch rivals.

373
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:30,510
I'm like...

374
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:30,870
Yay!

375
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:32,550
Yippee!

376
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:33,950
Thank you!

377
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:35,250
I'm like...

378
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,230
Thank you so much!

379
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:38,090
I can still be like...

380
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:39,370
I don't even go here.

381
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:40,490
And I'm participating.

382
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,090
I can still say that!

383
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:42,990
Yay!

384
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:47,630
So that was really nice.

385
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:48,450
I was like...

386
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:49,010
Oh my god.

387
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:49,850
Thank fucking god.

388
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:51,670
I can still do...

389
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:53,330
I can still do Twitch rivals.

390
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:55,150
Oh my god.

391
00:17:55,790 --> 00:18:01,710
But yeah, like every day is just another thing to do on my checklist of like...

392
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:03,880
All the other...

393
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:04,800
Of like...

394
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:06,410
Of like...

395
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:07,390
Like just be like...

396
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:07,590
Alright.

397
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:10,650
So usually a VTuber would have...

398
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:11,170
You know...

399
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:11,670
Would...

400
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:14,150
It would take a VTuber like maybe like...

401
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:17,510
Six plus months to like get this done.

402
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:18,550
In their career.

403
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:19,970
And then I'm like...

404
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:20,170
Alright.

405
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:22,010
Gotta finish this in one day.

406
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:25,930
Gotta get all these editors down in one day.

407
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:29,010
Make a server for them.

408
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:33,210
So they can work together on clipping my stuff for my channel.

409
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:34,190
Alright.

410
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:35,890
Gotta contact like...

411
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:37,550
Like overlay people.

412
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:39,030
Shit like that.

413
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:39,530
Boom.

414
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:40,750
One day done.

415
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:41,810
Alright.

416
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:42,910
Set up the store.

417
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:43,990
Boom.

418
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:44,990
One day done.

419
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:47,490
Contacting artists to make my channel.

420
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:48,370
Make future merch.

421
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:48,930
Boom.

422
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:50,310
Another day gone.

423
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:53,830
Holy fuck.

424
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:56,170
Speaking of speedrunning.

425
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:57,270
I have to...

426
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:59,330
I have to make a new...

427
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:00,210
God damn it!

428
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:01,990
You think they'll let me change?

429
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:05,070
Guys.

430
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:06,390
Can you...

431
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:10,730
Can you like name change your speedrun?

432
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:13,710
Your speedrun.com username?

433
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:15,730
Guys.

434
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:16,170
Guys.

435
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:16,550
Guys.

436
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:16,890
Guys.

437
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:16,910
Guys.

438
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:18,550
Can you like name change your speedrun?

439
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:20,870
These are still my records!

440
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:23,630
Those are still my records!

441
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:27,590
I swear.

442
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:28,130
I am...

443
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:28,770
You know what?

444
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:29,290
I'll...

445
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:30,250
I'll check that out later.

446
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:33,750
I'm gonna see if I can name change my speedrun.com.

447
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:36,410
speedrun.com username.

448
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:38,610
For those who don't know...

449
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:41,370
In the past...

450
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:47,470
In the past, I've submitted speedruns on speedrun.com.

451
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:52,790
They're not necessarily speedruns, but like...

452
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:57,890
They're so ridiculous that...

453
00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:01,870
They still accept my runs.

454
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:04,570
So it'll be like something like, you know...

455
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:15,950
If there's like 30 submitted runs and then like the 29th run would be like some like one hour or something something to complete and then the 30th run will be me.

456
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:21,910
And it'll be like five hours and then the mods there would be like, you know what?

457
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:24,910
It's still... she submitted it.

458
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:30,490
She's... she's still the 30th person to submit it.

459
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:33,230
So like I guess we accept it.

460
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:36,870
I guess we accept... except for one.

461
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:47,450
There was only one time I got fucking rejected and it was for fucking Peppa Pig because...

462
00:20:47,450 --> 00:21:04,430
Out of all the games I've submitted Peppa Pig was the only time someone... one of the mods rejected it because the mod was like, this is serious.

463
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:15,210
Of course the Peppa Pig mods were the ones that told me that.

464
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:17,030
They told me this is serious.

465
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:19,150
This is clearly not a speed run.

466
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:22,330
And I was just like why Peppa Pig.

467
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:27,250
Why Peppa Pig of all the games, Why was it Peppa Pig?

468
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:44,230
I was like I would, I was like, I know I'm like, you know what reasonable that Reasonable that like they would reject me but the fact that the other moderators were like, hee hee ha ha like this anime girl.

469
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:47,730
Let this girl- ah- This anime girl will make a fool of herself.

470
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:53,050
But the Peppa Pig speedrunning community is very serious indeed.

471
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:57,470
So don't submit joke runs in the Peppa Pig community.

472
00:21:57,850 --> 00:22:00,590
They do not take that kindly.

473
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:03,070
They are not here to fuck around.

474
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:05,470
It's a very serious speedrunning community.

475
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:07,310
Um... but...

476
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:14,230
I still couldn't believe that they rejected me there.

477
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:15,090
But yeah...

478
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:16,430
Yep.

479
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:17,670
Don't worry.

480
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:24,270
I, Doki, will continue on the tradition of submitting runs for fucking stupid games.

481
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:32,690
I saw someone chat was like, Peppa Pig isn't just a game, Doki.

482
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:34,190
You don't understand.

483
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:39,830
There are like 0.001 like, uh...

484
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:41,350
There's like...

485
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:43,810
buttons.

486
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:44,770
Button teleporting...

487
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:46,150
Okay guys, you can tell I...

488
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:48,430
Sorry, I'm like a professional speedrunner.

489
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:51,410
I do have like records on speedrun.com.

490
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:53,210
But like, uh...

491
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:55,490
I like invent my own terms, okay?

492
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:56,850
That's what professionals do.

493
00:22:56,990 --> 00:23:01,170
We don't use the established terms that you normies out there use.

494
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:04,230
We have our own specific personalized terms.

495
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:08,090
Um... that only people within the speedrun community uses.

496
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:09,030
So...

497
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:09,810
Hahahaha...

498
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:14,150
Oh my god.

499
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:15,870
Uh...

500
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:17,870
But that reminds me that I do have...

501
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:18,250
I should...

502
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:18,650
I should...

503
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:20,870
I should make a new speedrun.com account.

504
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:22,410
Okay, guys.

505
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:23,530
Alright, so...

506
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:26,170
Um... later on, I'll be showing you guys...

507
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:28,050
Uh... the Lunar New Year merch.

508
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:29,350
That'll be releasing...

509
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:32,570
Not today, because that'll be fucking crazy.

510
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:33,190
Hahaha...

511
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:34,270
Me...

512
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:35,430
Like...

513
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:37,790
I already have a lot of things to do.

514
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:38,350
So...

515
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:40,330
It will not be released today.

516
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:41,350
Even though...

517
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:43,610
You know, it would be the perfect time to release it.

518
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:44,430
But like...

519
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:44,770
We...

520
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:45,590
Me...

521
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:47,710
Mr. Man...

522
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:48,650
Little Man...

523
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:51,670
Have a lot of work to do with our current orders.

524
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:54,610
And our current...

525
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:56,010
And our...

526
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:56,450
Um...

527
00:23:57,210 --> 00:23:57,810
Uh...

528
00:23:57,810 --> 00:23:58,690
Our current...

529
00:23:58,690 --> 00:23:59,250
Like...

530
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:00,690
Workload that we have to do.

531
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:01,930
So they'll be released...

532
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:03,070
Much later.

533
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:04,370
But like...

534
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:05,130
Oh my gosh.

535
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:07,070
So there was this one artist...

536
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:07,930
I...

537
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:08,810
Uh...

538
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:10,390
Contacted.

539
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:11,990
How much merch are we buying?

540
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:12,950
Double merch?

541
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:13,870
Look guys.

542
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:17,450
Rebuilding a shrine is a lot of work.

543
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:20,510
Also I don't mind if you guys like...

544
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:21,210
Uh...

545
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:22,790
Merch shrines and stuff.

546
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:24,050
Because you know...

547
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:25,130
It was still me.

548
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:28,750
And this current time is still me inside.

549
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:29,990
So...

550
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:30,490
Uh...

551
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:33,210
No matter what form I take...

552
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:34,570
We all know...

553
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:35,490
Within...

554
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:36,590
Inside me...

555
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:37,770
Was still a tomato.

556
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:39,230
So like...

557
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:39,770
Like...

558
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:41,890
You might not have seen a tomato...

559
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:42,930
Inside me.

560
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:43,790
The other...

561
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:44,610
The other one.

562
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:46,450
But there was a tomato inside...

563
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:47,310
Inside of it.

564
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:47,910
So...

565
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:52,230
So...

566
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:53,050
So...

567
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:54,290
In the end...

568
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:55,090
If you want...

569
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:56,850
Merch forms...

570
00:24:56,850 --> 00:24:57,990
Merch shrines...

571
00:24:57,990 --> 00:24:59,190
That's cool by me.

572
00:24:59,390 --> 00:24:59,850
Yeah.

573
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:01,550
It's cool by me.

574
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:03,110
Like in the end...

575
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:04,330
There was always a tomato.

576
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:05,750
Um...

577
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:07,010
But yeah.

578
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:07,670
Oh my gosh.

579
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:08,450
Speaking of...

580
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:09,890
I did not realize...

581
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:11,870
My tomato mama...

582
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:12,930
Was the person...

583
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:14,630
That made the shrimp Miku.

584
00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:16,150
Because that shit like...

585
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:17,010
I saw that when...

586
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:18,790
That comic went viral.

587
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:20,130
And I was like...

588
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:20,490
What the...

589
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:20,750
Who...

590
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:21,010
Wait...

591
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:21,490
Who's this?

592
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:21,890
Wait...

593
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:22,650
Was this the person?

594
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:23,570
Because like...

595
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:24,230
I...

596
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:24,560
I...

597
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:25,530
I...

598
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:28,250
I remember...

599
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,150
I remember the day...

600
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:31,270
I asked them...

601
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:33,090
To make me a tome...

602
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:33,870
Make my...

603
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:34,910
True form...

604
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:36,070
My tomato form.

605
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:38,410
And it was like...

606
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:38,790
Um...

607
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:39,810
It was like...

608
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:40,630
On Tumblr...

609
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,300
Like...

610
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:46,020
I never...

611
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:49,520
I never realized what their Twitter was.

612
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:52,640
I like asked on Tumblr.

613
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:55,060
So I was just like...

614
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:55,900
Oh my god.

615
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:57,980
It's the shrimp Miku artist.

616
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:58,620
So who...

617
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:01,620
Those who don't know who the shrimp Miku artist was...

618
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:02,920
Um...

619
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:05,180
The shrimp Miku artist...

620
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:07,640
Was the one that did the shrimp Miku.

621
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,580
I know.

622
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:09,380
It's...

623
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:10,140
It's so...

624
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,460
The...

625
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:13,860
The shrimp cooking Miku.

626
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:14,680
Um...

627
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:17,900
That was you know like the Hatsune Miku contest that they...

628
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:20,220
That they like host every winter.

629
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,440
So like...

630
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,000
Um...

631
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,220
Like their design went viral.

632
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:26,560
And then like everybody really liked it.

633
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,860
Because the shrimp Miku was holding a knife.

634
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,440
Like you know...

635
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,400
They were like...

636
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:33,080
No.

637
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,040
Miku does not hold knives.

638
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:37,800
I think...

639
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:38,280
I don't know.

640
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,860
It's like the funniest reasons why I never went to the finals.

641
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:41,900
Because they're like...

642
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:42,560
No.

643
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:43,580
No.

644
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:44,280
No.

645
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:45,860
No knives for Miku.

646
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:47,360
It's like how they're like...

647
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,160
Mickey Mouse must never hold a knife.

648
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:51,920
Mickey Mouse must always be PG.

649
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,160
Mickey Mouse must never have a purse.

650
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,640
I know like you can be like the...

651
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,020
The recent Mickey cartoons with the really funky art style.

652
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:01,520
That show was really good.

653
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,060
That was a really good cartoon show.

654
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:03,880
But like...

655
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,120
If you guys didn't know...

656
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:07,120
Like the...

657
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,700
The handling of Mickey Mouse was...

658
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:10,400
Oh my god!

659
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,280
I can literally pick up...

660
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,020
Put a picture of...

661
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:16,340
Of Mickey Mouse on my screen if I wanted to.

662
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:19,000
Also the fact that it's public domain anyway.

663
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,400
So like the...

664
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:20,940
The...

665
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:22,580
Steamboat Willy Mickey.

666
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:23,100
But anyway.

667
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,360
But like...

668
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,180
Like the...

669
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:29,460
The thing about Mickey Mouse is that on the guidelines about Mickey...

670
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:31,720
Is that he must not have a personality.

671
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:35,660
Or like his personality must be generic as fuck.

672
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:38,560
So that anyone can like...

673
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,180
So that...

674
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:40,260
So that like...

675
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,560
He doesn't...

676
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:43,000
Like he doesn't have...

677
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:46,120
Any ideals that you can imprint on him.

678
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:50,340
So he has to be like...

679
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:53,120
Super generic with like...

680
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,580
So that he does not offend anybody.

681
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:59,840
So that's why Mickey cannot hold it.

682
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:03,560
Mickey cannot do any of those bad things.

683
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:08,960
Mickey is a self-insert.

684
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,560
I mean even if it was a self-insert.

685
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,000
If it was a self-insert...

686
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:14,680
At least he would have a personality.

687
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:17,920
But Mickey Mouse is meant to have no personality.

688
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,420
Or like the most generic fucking personality out there.

689
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:22,700
Um...

690
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:25,100
Because they don't wanna like...

691
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:28,400
Cause like he's now just a mascot of like Disney.

692
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,220
He's not like an actual like...

693
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:31,280
He's not real.

694
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,220
I mean he...

695
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:32,920
I'm sorry.

696
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:33,940
He was never real.

697
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:35,060
But like...

698
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:35,360
He...

699
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:39,720
He's just like the face of the company type deal.

700
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,760
Like a little puppet for everybody.

701
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,000
He's not like an actual...

702
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:43,680
Like...

703
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,440
Per...

704
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,600
Like a actual personality anymore.

705
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:48,020
Um...

706
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:50,520
He's a JRPG protagonist.

707
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:51,980
That...

708
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,180
Oh my god.

709
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,240
Oh yeah.

710
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,040
A little fun fact.

711
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:58,960
Also another fucking fun fact.

712
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,060
You know like those...

713
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:01,420
That time when I like...

714
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:05,040
All I did to pass the time was either play video games.

715
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,260
He's real to me.

716
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:08,280
Hehehehehe.

717
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:12,980
What's it like to have the most fucking generic character as your friend?

718
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:14,500
Your favorite Disney character?

719
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:15,940
Hehehehehe.

720
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:17,420
Hehehehehe.

721
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,400
I swear.

722
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:22,180
Even though like Mickey is like the face of Disney.

723
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:24,340
He's never the most...

724
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:25,600
He's never the favorite.

725
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,480
He's just like...

726
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,340
He's never the fucking favorite.

727
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,760
If you ask people like...

728
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,020
Who's your favorite Disney character?

729
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:32,840
I...

730
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:36,380
More people would say Donald Duck than fucking Mickey.

731
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:41,280
Because like at least Donald has an actual personality and shit.

732
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,900
Like at least like people like...

733
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:43,960
Fucking relates...

734
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:44,980
Relates to him.

735
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:45,660
Because you're like...

736
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:45,900
Wow!

737
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:47,720
My god!

738
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:48,600
He's like...

739
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,740
He's like somebody that has a personality.

740
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:52,500
Uh...

741
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:55,620
No one will ever really say Mickey Mouse.

742
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:59,760
Unless you wanna buy like his Mickey ears that are like...

743
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,320
$30 over price.

744
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:02,180
Hehehehehe.

745
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,660
I can say all that.

746
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,140
I mean I feel like I used to say this stuff too.

747
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:10,600
But like I wouldn't be as harsh.

748
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,460
But now I'm like...

749
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:15,520
Well I can sort of be harsher now.

750
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:17,960
Unless!

751
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,200
Disney!

752
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,520
If you wanna sponsor me...

753
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,380
Um...

754
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:23,800
I didn't mean all that.

755
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:24,540
I swear.

756
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:25,520
I swear to god.

757
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,440
I still love Disney.

758
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,480
I still love Disney.

759
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:32,620
Just not...

760
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:34,740
Mickey's just not my thing.

761
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,500
I still love Disney.

762
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,300
Just not Mickey.

763
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,700
Mickey is just not my favorite.

764
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,840
I think my favorite Disney character is...

765
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,040
Uhhhh...

766
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,060
Uhhhh...

767
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:47,720
I think it is sort of...

768
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:50,840
Donald was my favorite.

769
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,980
I'm not sure if current Disney is still Donald.

770
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:54,680
You know what?

771
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,840
Cause I haven't...

772
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,900
I think we all know...

773
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,500
Disney movies...

774
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,040
So far...

775
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:05,120
Haven't been doing so hot.

776
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:09,740
Like it hasn't been like doing that well lately.

777
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,520
Including Pixar.

778
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,980
Because like...

779
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:14,400
The thing about Disney...

780
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,580
I like how this is like Happy Lunar New Year.

781
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:18,840
But I'm just going off these like...

782
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:22,800
Random fucking tangents that are unrelated to Lunar New Year.

783
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:24,660
Um...

784
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:25,640
But like...

785
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,660
Recently so far...

786
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:29,460
Recently so far...

787
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:30,300
Uh...

788
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:34,640
A lot of like movies from Disney and Pixar...

789
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,340
Are like...

790
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:37,580
And all the franchises that Disney owns...

791
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:38,920
Which is a lot of them...

792
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,960
Have been like set to like...

793
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,460
Made so much money...

794
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:45,760
And they're so scared to fail now...

795
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,520
That they go through the same...

796
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,600
Fucking formula.

797
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:52,340
Over and over and over again.

798
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,700
And they're too scared...

799
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:56,720
Of making a new IP...

800
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,400
Because they don't want to fail even more.

801
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:02,040
Because the last time they tried to make new IPs...

802
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,960
Now like the last five years...

803
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,600
Is the fact that like...

804
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,120
Um...

805
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,640
It didn't do so well.

806
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:08,880
So now...

807
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,940
They're banking on nostalgia factor.

808
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,560
And making five to ten...

809
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:14,840
Plus sequels now.

810
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:16,540
Like what do they say?

811
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:18,040
These are like this year...

812
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:20,080
They're gonna be working on Toy Story...

813
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,000
Like a sequel for Toy Story...

814
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,440
For Cars...

815
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,120
For like...

816
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,580
There's like so many...

817
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:26,460
Fuck Toy Story...

818
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:29,200
Why the fuck does Toy Story need another sequel?

819
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:30,760
It ended perfectly.

820
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:32,920
Also please...

821
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:36,300
Tom Hanks and the other guy...

822
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:40,860
I'm sorry.

823
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,100
But like...

824
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,460
Not gonna lie...

825
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:46,440
The other guy that plays Buzz Lightyear...

826
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,460
He's really only...

827
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:50,140
He's really...

828
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:53,100
His only like work right now is Toy Story.

829
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:54,080
Uh...

830
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:56,740
Tim Allen!

831
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,240
You guys can be like...

832
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:58,960
I know you guys are like...

833
00:32:58,960 --> 00:32:59,380
But Doki!

834
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:02,180
Tim Allen has done this and this...

835
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,600
Yes in the 90's.

836
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,660
I don't know if you guys know...

837
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:12,640
But like...

838
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,820
I feel like...

839
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:15,060
If you ask like...

840
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:16,060
A zoomer...

841
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:17,440
Right now...

842
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,180
Who the fuck is Tim Allen?

843
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,480
They would be like...

844
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:21,820
What?

845
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,440
They would be like...

846
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,580
Who is Tim Allen?

847
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,580
I don't think any zoomer right now...

848
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,520
Would know who Tim Allen is.

849
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:40,620
Just know it was the 2010's.

850
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:41,360
Just know it was the 2010's.

851
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:41,780
Um...

852
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:43,940
Yeah anyway...

853
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,840
Michael Theodore Mouse?

854
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:47,820
Is it real?

855
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:51,260
I know like Mickey was like based off of something...

856
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:53,280
Walt Disney wanted to like...

857
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:53,920
I don't remember.

858
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:54,660
I just know like...

859
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:57,020
It was something related to Walt Disney.

860
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:59,100
Somebody related to Walt Disney.

861
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,480
But yeah... Oh yeah.

862
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:02,100
The Wish.

863
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:02,940
Yeah.

864
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,340
You know like...

865
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:06,360
The music...

866
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:10,060
Okay I feel like everybody talked about the music of the Wish.

867
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:10,980
But like...

868
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:14,600
The composers they got to write the Wish...

869
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,060
Like the music wise...

870
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:16,960
Were like...

871
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,880
Top 100 like pop song music.

872
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:21,020
And like...

873
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:22,520
That's fine and all.

874
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:27,140
But like Disney music is not meant to be a pop song.

875
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:28,340
It's not.

876
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:29,400
Because like...

877
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,800
Also like pop songs are like...

878
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,460
Usually about like...

879
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,160
You know...

880
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:37,260
Like romance and like love and like...

881
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:39,620
Girl crushes or boy crush...

882
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:40,880
Mostly girl crushes.

883
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:41,460
They would be like...

884
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:45,400
I mean girls crushing on boys for like tweens and stuff.

885
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:46,460
And...

886
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,180
And like...

887
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:51,960
So they weren't writing it as if the song has a story.

888
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:54,180
That builds up to the...

889
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:56,580
Because like they are trying to write a top hit song.

890
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:57,440
Per song.

891
00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:00,220
So like none of the songs connected to each other.

892
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:01,860
Because normally pop songs...

893
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:03,040
You know...

894
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:03,960
They don't connect...

895
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,700
Like if you have an album full of pop songs from an artist.

896
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,600
They don't connect to one another.

897
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:09,760
They like...

898
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,580
There's no story behind it.

899
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:13,300
Each song itself is a story.

900
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:15,180
But not like...

901
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:19,740
Like a story from one story to another story.

902
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,600
That leads up and connects to each other.

903
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,780
It's literally like...

904
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:24,960
Here's it's own story.

905
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,160
That doesn't fucking make sense.

906
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,360
Because it's supposed to...

907
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,080
They want to have like a trendy song.

908
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,160
And then here's another story.

909
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,040
That doesn't fucking make sense.

910
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:38,000
Because they wanted to try and get like a top 10 billboard pop song.

911
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:40,360
And then...

912
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,240
And then...

913
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:45,060
And then she becomes a fucking fairy godmother.

914
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:47,580
And then she becomes a fucking fairy godmother.

915
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:49,520
Alright spoiler alert.

916
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:52,420
Because I know for sure none of you guys are going to watch Wish anyway.

917
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:53,560
Because I know for sure none of you guys are going to watch Wish anyway.

918
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,480
Neither am I.

919
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:56,180
I just watched someone else.

920
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:58,600
So like this information you're getting from me.

921
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:00,120
Is basically...

922
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,860
I got it from another video.

923
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:03,220
So now I'm regurg...

924
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:05,060
You're basically getting a name.

925
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:07,260
Researched that by going to 3Ders.

926
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:10,300
So like this information is like...

927
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:11,440
Forth hand.

928
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,680
You're getting...

929
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,080
Forth hand information.

930
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:16,600
So...

931
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:19,580
Because I'm not fucking paying money to watch Wish.

932
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:21,340
But basically...

933
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:24,420
And I don't think any of you guys are going to watch Wish in the end.

934
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,100
Unless like... I don't know.

935
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:27,660
I don't know.

936
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,320
You're like a Disney completionist or something.

937
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:31,860
But basically...

938
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:34,200
Wish ends it.

939
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:36,600
Because it's supposed to be a celebration of like...

940
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,920
100 years of Disney.

941
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,420
So like it's not meant to be...

942
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:42,040
It doesn't have it's own identity.

943
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:43,660
It's mostly...

944
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:45,140
It's like a nostalgia factor.

945
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,480
Based off of like it's own IP.

946
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,540
So you're trying to instill nostalgia.

947
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:51,700
Also...

948
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:53,740
Fuck the live action Pinocchio.

949
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,320
Because they did that too.

950
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:56,920
I watched it with my friend.

951
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:59,160
Like they had a scene where it's like...

952
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:02,220
Look at all these Disney IPs that we own.

953
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,680
That we show.

954
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,000
With the clocks.

955
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:08,340
And I was like why the fuck is this all Disney?

956
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:09,360
They're like...

957
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:12,180
You want to see how much IPs we own?

958
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,300
And it's like...

959
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:15,640
And you see like...

960
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:17,660
Like hundreds of like...

961
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:20,400
Like miniature Disney IPs.

962
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,360
In like form of clocks and stuff.

963
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:23,680
So they keep doing that.

964
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:25,300
So...

965
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:27,840
Um...

966
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:30,100
Anyway...

967
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:32,240
Sorry I got a little pissed off.

968
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:35,320
Because I can't believe I watched live action Pinocchio.

969
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:36,380
But like...

970
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:36,860
It was...

971
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:39,060
I watched it for 15 to 20 minutes.

972
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:41,940
And it was 15 to 20 minutes too fucking long.

973
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,320
Anyway...

974
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:47,060
At the end of Wish.

975
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:48,620
They were like...

976
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:50,320
Like the main character...

977
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,900
Becomes the fairy...

978
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:52,380
The...

979
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:52,900
What is it?

980
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:54,700
Cinderella's godmother or something?

981
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:57,960
They implied that she becomes...

982
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,180
The godmother...

983
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:02,740
The fairy godmother.

984
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:03,460
In Cinderella.

985
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:04,740
And I was like...

986
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:05,640
What the fuck?

987
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:10,760
And then they imply that all these people...

988
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,420
Like the main antagonist...

989
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:16,580
Becomes the mirror in Snow White.

990
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:17,860
And I'm like...

991
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:18,260
Why?

992
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:20,560
What the...

993
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,340
Why?

994
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:25,440
Why did they retcon their entire Disney line up?

995
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:26,980
Why did they retcon their entire Disney line up?

996
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:28,440
It doesn't make sense.

997
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:30,740
They retconned the entire...

998
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:31,060
They retconned the entire...

999
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:33,900
Past of Disney to be like...

1000
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,360
Wish was the OG.

1001
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,140
It was the original.

1002
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:38,920
It was the original.

1003
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:41,960
It was the original.

1004
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,020
So yeah.

1005
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:49,040
That's why I'm like...

1006
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,180
I don't know if you guys noticed this.

1007
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,260
But I'm definitely...

1008
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:52,700
Oh yeah.

1009
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:55,100
They made it cinematic.

1010
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:58,200
As if we don't have...

1011
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:00,820
Enough cinematic universes...

1012
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:02,300
In the fucking world.

1013
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,400
They basically made the...

1014
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,940
Disney animation cinematic universe.

1015
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:08,800
I was like...

1016
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,460
Really?

1017
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:12,300
So anyway...

1018
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,000
I saved you guys like...

1019
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,700
I don't know how long Wish is.

1020
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:18,360
But I saved you guys enough time...

1021
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,720
To never watch Wish.

1022
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:22,260
Because it is absolutely...

1023
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:23,500
It sounds terrible.

1024
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,740
And like...

1025
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:27,160
I don't want to put myself through watching it.

1026
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,060
Because I feel like I already know...

1027
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:30,060
It sounds terrible.

1028
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:33,240
And I listen to the songs and the lyrics make...

1029
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,600
No fucking sense.

1030
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,660
The DCAU.

1031
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:39,700
The DCAU.

1032
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,460
But like...

1033
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:42,380
Like okay.

1034
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:43,360
If you ever listen...

1035
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,920
I listen to one Wish song.

1036
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:47,780
And the lyrics don't make fucking sense.

1037
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:50,120
Like not even like grammar wise.

1038
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:51,220
Because it's like...

1039
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:53,740
It's like a very deep lyric.

1040
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:56,800
But there was like one part where they're like...

1041
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,500
It's like they use R.

1042
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,640
Instead of like...

1043
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,420
I don't know... is or something.

1044
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:05,060
And it did not make fucking sense.

1045
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,480
I was like...

1046
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,880
What the fuck is going on?

1047
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:11,680
What the fuck is going on?

1048
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:12,340
Excuse me.

1049
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:14,100
Um...

1050
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:15,580
But yes.

1051
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:18,140
Okay we might watch Wish's members maybe.

1052
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:21,000
So we can actually like figure out...

1053
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,360
What the fuck is going on.

1054
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:25,500
Like...

1055
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:26,580
It's...

1056
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:27,660
And then like Pix...

1057
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:29,840
I don't even remember the last Pixar movie.

1058
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:31,640
Like...

1059
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:34,220
It's so soulless now.

1060
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,120
That's why I don't...

1061
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:35,600
Like a lot...

1062
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,480
For those who don't know...

1063
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:40,680
A lot of the Pixar staff and stuff got restructured.

1064
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:43,400
And they left to Sony Animation.

1065
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:46,560
Which is why Sony Animation is very...

1066
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:46,940
Um...

1067
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:49,740
Sony Animation is like incredibly...

1068
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:52,520
Uh... Like... It's like doing...

1069
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:54,600
Well... Because...

1070
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,240
Sony and Dreamworks.

1071
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:58,420
Because a lot of old Pixar...

1072
00:40:58,420 --> 00:40:59,760
Okay Elemental.

1073
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,600
Not gonna lie.

1074
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:02,180
Um...

1075
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:04,460
Elemental...

1076
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:07,260
Despite how fucked up the...

1077
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:08,820
Marketing was...

1078
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:11,140
It was actually a good movie.

1079
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:12,780
Like...

1080
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:15,600
For some fucking reason...

1081
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,400
They fucked up the...

1082
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,280
Marketing of Elemental.

1083
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:21,120
Because for some reason...

1084
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:21,960
They tried to like...

1085
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,900
Advertise the wrong thing.

1086
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:26,760
For Elemental.

1087
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,520
So like a lot of people...

1088
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,640
Were like criticizing it.

1089
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:31,480
And stuff.

1090
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:33,320
And then when I finally watched it...

1091
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,320
I watched it on a plane.

1092
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,020
By the way.

1093
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,180
Most movies now...

1094
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:37,480
I just watch it on planes.

1095
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,900
Because like... I can't...

1096
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:43,100
I don't have the patience to like...

1097
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:43,940
Sit...

1098
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:46,100
Sit down on my PC.

1099
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:47,680
Because I don't go to the theaters.

1100
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,640
To stream a movie.

1101
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:52,360
Because I'm always like...

1102
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,120
Working and stuff.

1103
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,040
But like...

1104
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:56,920
I actually cried in like...

1105
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:57,600
Some parts.

1106
00:41:57,940 --> 00:41:58,840
But like...

1107
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,020
They had like a...

1108
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:03,340
A fake movie... For those who don't know...

1109
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:04,680
Elemental...

1110
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:07,080
Had a fake movie reaction...

1111
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,280
Scene...

1112
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:09,820
As a marketing thing.

1113
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:10,420
Because...

1114
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:12,180
There was this rock boy...

1115
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:14,820
Or this like... Was it this grass boy...

1116
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:16,460
And like they tried to make him like...

1117
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:18,180
The funniest character ever.

1118
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:20,360
Like he's like... Tried to make him a...

1119
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:21,260
Thief.

1120
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:22,520
Even though he was in the film.

1121
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:24,920
For like... Two minutes.

1122
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:27,620
This little boy...

1123
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:29,020
Was in the...

1124
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:29,960
Claude!

1125
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,580
Yeah this little boy...

1126
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:33,500
Was in the film...

1127
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:35,240
For like two to five...

1128
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:35,760
Minutes.

1129
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,020
But they tried to...

1130
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:39,160
Make him like the funniest shit...

1131
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:40,160
Ever for marketing.

1132
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:41,600
Because like they...

1133
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:44,260
The official Disney...

1134
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:46,860
Like TikTok account or something...

1135
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:48,880
The Elemental TikTok account...

1136
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,500
Posted a fake...

1137
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:52,160
Movie reaction...

1138
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,260
To when Claude came on...

1139
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:56,160
Screen... Sorry...

1140
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,660
Came on screen...

1141
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:00,340
And it's like... You know like the...

1142
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:02,180
Big Bang Theory laughs and stuff...

1143
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:04,520
They inserted like... Big Bang Theory...

1144
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:06,040
Laugh tracks and stuff...

1145
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:07,040
And be like...

1146
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:09,380
And like...

1147
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:12,280
Whenever Claude came on...

1148
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:14,100
And like... Oh my Claude!

1149
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:15,040
And I'm like...

1150
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:18,140
And then move... And it's like...

1151
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,240
Movie theater...

1152
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:22,640
And then like quote on quote...

1153
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,600
Movie theater as like a...

1154
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:27,060
Fake reaction marketing...

1155
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:27,640
And...

1156
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:30,480
And like... They pushed...

1157
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,760
Him so fucking hard...

1158
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:34,580
And I was like... Why the fuck...

1159
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:35,960
Is he... Why?

1160
00:43:36,550 --> 00:43:38,840
But then like the movie itself wasn't...

1161
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:40,380
Bad... It was pretty...

1162
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:42,640
Decent... It was really good...

1163
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,680
But like they made everybody...

1164
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:46,680
Be like... Whoa don't watch...

1165
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:48,680
Elemental it sounds awful...

1166
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,980
Because of the Claude marketing...

1167
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:53,960
Laugh tracks and stuff...

1168
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:54,740
Like yeah...

1169
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:56,400
It's so...

1170
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,820
It was like the weirdest...

1171
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:00,360
Shit ever... Anyway...

1172
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,620
As much as like...

1173
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:05,160
I shit on... New Disney...

1174
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:06,780
Old Disney was pretty...

1175
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:08,720
Great... I still like Disney...

1176
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,880
Just not really... New Disney...

1177
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:12,840
New Disney is just...

1178
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:14,260
Too fucking...

1179
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:16,300
Um... Formulaic now...

1180
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:18,720
Um... I always felt it... I knew it was like...

1181
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,280
Getting super formulaic from...

1182
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:21,720
I don't like Marvel movies...

1183
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:24,900
This is my... Uh... Controversial take...

1184
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:27,080
Of... Controversial take...

1185
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:28,980
Number 530...

1186
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:29,600
Today...

1187
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,320
Laugh tracks and stuff...

1188
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:34,080
I find...

1189
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:36,200
I never really liked...

1190
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:37,800
The Marvel Universe...

1191
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:40,480
Because it was... It was just...

1192
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,380
I like... You know... You can be like...

1193
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:45,100
No... No... But what about this movie...

1194
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:45,920
It's just...

1195
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,520
If you look into the...

1196
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,620
Plotline... Like the...

1197
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:52,270
Story structure... Of the Marvel Universe...

1198
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:53,560
It's...

1199
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:56,120
It's the same thing... It's like...

1200
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:57,800
It's... It's literally the...

1201
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:59,220
Same story...

1202
00:44:59,770 --> 00:45:01,380
Spanned into like...

1203
00:45:01,530 --> 00:45:03,280
20 different movies...

1204
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:05,880
It's...

1205
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:07,680
It's so predictable...

1206
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,500
It's so...

1207
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:12,100
It's so... I will admit...

1208
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:13,620
Like the first... You know...

1209
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:15,900
The first 2 or 3 of the Marvel movies...

1210
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:17,560
Other than Guardians of the Galaxy...

1211
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:19,960
But that is because... James Gunn...

1212
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:21,620
Is a very talented director...

1213
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:22,980
But then...

1214
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:25,960
But then James Gunn became formulaic too...

1215
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:27,680
They like... Try to follow the...

1216
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:29,660
James Gunn formula...

1217
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:30,900
Cause they're like...

1218
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:33,340
Cause they're like... Oh my god...

1219
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:36,220
Guardians of the Galaxy did so well...

1220
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:38,380
Because it never felt like a Marvel movie...

1221
00:45:38,380 --> 00:45:39,720
It didn't feel like a fucking...

1222
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:40,840
Marvel movie...

1223
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:42,880
So then they were like... Oh my god...

1224
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:44,660
We need to copy this now...

1225
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:48,000
And every fucking movie started becoming...

1226
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,620
Like Guardians of the Galaxy...

1227
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:51,600
And it's like they add humor...

1228
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:53,860
When it wasn't supposed to be meant to be humor...

1229
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:55,340
And it's like...

1230
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:57,820
That is my rant of the day...

1231
00:45:57,820 --> 00:45:59,020
That is...

1232
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:05,960
That is...

1233
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:06,680
That is...

1234
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,720
That is...

1235
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:09,000
That is...

1236
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:09,840
That is my rant...

1237
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:10,980
Oh yeah also like...

1238
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:13,560
Tidy or whatever was his name...

1239
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:15,520
He's also a good director too...

1240
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:17,600
He's also like...

1241
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:18,240
A...

1242
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:20,600
A really decent director...

1243
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:23,060
But then like... Disney tried to fucking...

1244
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:25,220
It's like... I don't... They're like... You did so well...

1245
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:27,000
Let's copy that... And then it's like... No...

1246
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,180
The thing that they did so well...

1247
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:30,900
Was what made it super unique...

1248
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:32,680
If you keep fucking copying it...

1249
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:35,000
It's not gonna be unique anymore...

1250
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,760
Like that's the thing... If you keep copying it...

1251
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:38,880
It's not gonna be...

1252
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:41,760
Good... Because it's the same thing...

1253
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:42,460
...

1254
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:48,220
Oh my god...

1255
00:46:48,220 --> 00:46:48,780
Oh my god...

1256
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:49,000
Oh my god... Anyway...

1257
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,540
I'm speaking my... I'm speaking my truth...

1258
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:52,300
Right now...

1259
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:55,460
I had like one month build up...

1260
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:57,520
Of things I wanted to complain about...

1261
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:58,720
And I'm getting out...

1262
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:01,340
On Lunar New Year by the way...

1263
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:03,880
But Doki...

1264
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:06,040
Are we supposed to have a name and a form...

1265
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:07,760
Guys let me speak my truth...

1266
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:09,200
Then I'll name you guys...

1267
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:11,560
Then I will name all you guys...

1268
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:13,440
I need to speak my truth...

1269
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:14,360
Right now...

1270
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:17,260
Um...

1271
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:19,480
Um...

1272
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:21,660
If it sells... It sells...

1273
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:23,380
Yeah... But like... It's so...

1274
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:25,740
I'm trying to remember... There was this director...

1275
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:27,420
That was like... I fucking hate...

1276
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:28,620
Superhero movies...

1277
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:31,800
I forgot which director said that...

1278
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:34,040
But like... There was a director...

1279
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:35,620
Anyway... If Marvel wants...

1280
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:37,660
To sponsor me... I love...

1281
00:47:37,660 --> 00:47:39,400
Marvel movies... By the way...

1282
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:44,640
Just saying...

1283
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:45,540
Just saying...

1284
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:47,620
Disregard everything I said earlier...

1285
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:49,540
I was... It was just a joke...

1286
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:51,100
I love Marvel movies...

1287
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:53,160
Anyway... Um... Um...

1288
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:55,460
There was like this one director...

1289
00:47:55,460 --> 00:47:56,700
Cause like he said like...

1290
00:47:57,260 --> 00:47:59,260
There's like no more soul...

1291
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:00,900
It's all about making money...

1292
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:03,060
At that point... Um...

1293
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:04,940
And that's why this director was like...

1294
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:06,980
I hate superhero movies... Because I...

1295
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:09,460
They don't care about filmmaking anymore...

1296
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:10,760
It's just all about...

1297
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:12,800
Movies that make money...

1298
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:15,420
So like... And which I agree... I agree...

1299
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:17,480
Every superhero movie is all about...

1300
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:19,240
Like trying to... Trying to...

1301
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:21,920
Not be like good... Story wise...

1302
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:23,540
But like... Good enough...

1303
00:48:23,540 --> 00:48:25,920
To make millions of dollars...

1304
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:27,360
Like...

1305
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:30,720
Which is...

1306
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:31,880
Um...

1307
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:33,100
Um... Which I...

1308
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:35,560
I 100% agree... I'm not even like a big...

1309
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:37,520
Movie person... Um...

1310
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:39,240
But like... I... I just...

1311
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:41,200
I just... Don't really enjoy...

1312
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:42,840
Enjoy superhero movies...

1313
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:44,680
Except if it's DC animated...

1314
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:47,500
Cause the funny thing about animated...

1315
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:48,780
D... DC movies...

1316
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:50,960
Is that they don't fucking care...

1317
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:53,400
About... About being...

1318
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:55,880
Like... Morally correct...

1319
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:56,920
Like...

1320
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:57,300
Like...

1321
00:48:57,300 --> 00:49:00,460
Like... But...

1322
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:03,610
They don't care about being morally correct...

1323
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:06,140
They actually go to places...

1324
00:49:06,140 --> 00:49:07,440
With their story...

1325
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,440
And... For the DC animated...

1326
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:10,980
Um...

1327
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:12,960
Movies... They actually like...

1328
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:15,740
Care to like... Do stuff with their stories...

1329
00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:18,180
And like... Surprise you...

1330
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:19,280
With like... What they...

1331
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:21,460
Wanna talk about... Um...

1332
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:23,260
Comics wise...

1333
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:25,380
I will admit like... Recent DC...

1334
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:27,000
Like... Even like...

1335
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,820
Comic wise... Recent DC comics...

1336
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:31,200
Fucking... Not great... Uh...

1337
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,020
The old ones were... Like...

1338
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:34,660
The ones in like 10 years ago...

1339
00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:36,740
Were so much better versus recent...

1340
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:38,680
Uh... Uh...

1341
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:41,420
But yeah... That's... My truth of the day...

1342
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:42,720
I... Sorry... I went through...

1343
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:45,020
A long tangent regarding...

1344
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:46,200
That...

1345
00:49:47,660 --> 00:49:49,360
You know what's cool though?

1346
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:50,680
I recently found out that...

1347
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:52,780
Santa Claus is like an X-Men...

1348
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:54,820
In... In...

1349
00:49:54,820 --> 00:49:55,920
Yeah... Like...

1350
00:49:56,740 --> 00:49:58,920
I was like... In like...

1351
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:00,680
Marvel Universe... Like...

1352
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:02,160
In the... Did you guys know that?

1353
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:04,680
Like... I saw like a YouTube short...

1354
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:06,820
Being like... Santa Claus is considered a...

1355
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:08,940
Mutant... And... And that's why...

1356
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:10,760
He can live for... He can teleport...

1357
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:12,800
To like... Houses all the time...

1358
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:14,940
And stuff like that... Yeah... He's like...

1359
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:16,680
Yeah... I was like... What the fuck?

1360
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:18,640
They made Santa Claus an...

1361
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:19,200
X-Men?

1362
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:20,860
I was like... Oh my god...

1363
00:50:20,860 --> 00:50:22,660
What the... What the...

1364
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:25,440
Fuck... Um...

1365
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:27,040
I mean... That makes sense...

1366
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:28,640
Also... Speaking of superheroes...

1367
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:31,400
I heard like the Suicide Squad...

1368
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:32,920
Um... Very...

1369
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:34,960
Poor timing with the name word that I just...

1370
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:35,820
Said out loud...

1371
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:36,540
I just...

1372
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:42,560
Said it out loud... I was like... Oh yeah...

1373
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:43,860
That's what they're called...

1374
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:46,580
Anyway... I heard the new game...

1375
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:48,120
For that...

1376
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:50,480
Was... Um...

1377
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:51,880
Was like...

1378
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:53,760
Because they're built off of like the...

1379
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:56,400
Arkham Asylum... The Arkham...

1380
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:58,960
Asylum games... And like...

1381
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:00,440
Apparently I heard...

1382
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:01,240
That like...

1383
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:04,960
If it wasn't in the same universe...

1384
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:06,760
As Arkham Asylum...

1385
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:08,040
It would have been like...

1386
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:10,740
An okay game... The fact that it was...

1387
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:12,480
Like... The fact that...

1388
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:14,780
It built off of like...

1389
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:16,960
Batman Arkham Asylum...

1390
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:18,360
And was also like...

1391
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:20,280
Kevin... Kevin Conroy?

1392
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:21,200
That's his name?

1393
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:22,400
The voice actor of Batman?

1394
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:23,940
That's been a voice actor of Batman?

1395
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:26,480
For like... Um...

1396
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:28,240
For like...

1397
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:30,840
A long, long, long, long time...

1398
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:32,460
And that was like his last...

1399
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:33,860
Fucking role...

1400
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:36,460
And they did him incredibly dirty...

1401
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:38,160
For his last role...

1402
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:40,820
To be fair... They did the entire Justice League...

1403
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:41,920
Very dirty...

1404
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:49,000
And like...

1405
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:49,780
And like...

1406
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:50,540
And like... I read...

1407
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:52,920
That like... If it wasn't connected...

1408
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:54,660
To Arkham Asylum...

1409
00:51:54,660 --> 00:51:55,540
It would...

1410
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:57,500
It would have been like...

1411
00:51:57,500 --> 00:51:59,380
As bad as...

1412
00:51:59,380 --> 00:52:01,880
And so the fact that they fucked over Kevin Conroy...

1413
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:04,700
Over there... It would have been as bad...

1414
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:06,520
As of the reception...

1415
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:08,380
And I heard they might be...

1416
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:10,140
Deleting Steam reviews... So I don't know...

1417
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:12,300
I don't know which is true...

1418
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:14,280
I don't know...

1419
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:16,060
Who it is...

1420
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:18,080
Oh...

1421
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:22,100
They lied about it being his last role?

1422
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:22,600
They lied about it being his last role?

1423
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:23,880
That's fucked up...

1424
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:26,160
That's actually fucked up...

1425
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:27,780
They like... They knew...

1426
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:30,740
They knew exactly... Okay, let's spoil it...

1427
00:52:30,740 --> 00:52:32,560
They kill off Batman...

1428
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:34,780
In like the middle of the game...

1429
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:36,100
They kill him off...

1430
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:37,160
And it was like the...

1431
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:40,240
It was like done very terribly...

1432
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:41,700
It was done incredibly...

1433
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:44,380
Terribly how they kill him off...

1434
00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:46,160
It's like... It's really weird...

1435
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:47,720
Um...

1436
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:48,680
So like...

1437
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:51,960
So like... So then they were like...

1438
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:53,360
This is gonna be his last role...

1439
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:54,940
And they knew... Alright...

1440
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:57,220
They knew how fucked up...

1441
00:52:57,220 --> 00:52:59,120
They're gonna kill him off...

1442
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:01,980
And then like... Why the fuck would they advertise it...

1443
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:03,960
As his last role... Knowing that like...

1444
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:05,320
In hindsight... I guess like in hindsight...

1445
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:07,480
They didn't know how bad the reception was...

1446
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:09,760
But like... I feel like if I was in the marketing room...

1447
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:12,780
And I was like... We're gonna kill off Kevin Conroy...

1448
00:53:12,780 --> 00:53:13,920
And we're gonna tell everybody...

1449
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:15,240
That's his last role...

1450
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:17,980
People are gonna fucking love that...

1451
00:53:17,980 --> 00:53:18,700
Like...

1452
00:53:23,630 --> 00:53:24,230
Like...

1453
00:53:24,230 --> 00:53:26,610
Why the... Why the fuck...

1454
00:53:26,610 --> 00:53:28,710
Who thought people would love that...

1455
00:53:28,710 --> 00:53:29,570
Like...

1456
00:53:30,610 --> 00:53:31,990
Like... People are gonna...

1457
00:53:31,990 --> 00:53:34,570
Fucking love that shit...

1458
00:53:36,430 --> 00:53:37,030
Like...

1459
00:53:37,030 --> 00:53:37,150
Like...

1460
00:53:39,270 --> 00:53:39,870
Um...

1461
00:53:40,390 --> 00:53:41,690
But like... Anyway...

1462
00:53:42,390 --> 00:53:43,650
Uh... What was I gonna say?

1463
00:53:43,790 --> 00:53:44,390
Oh yeah...

1464
00:53:44,390 --> 00:53:46,290
Uh... That's what I was like...

1465
00:53:46,290 --> 00:53:47,770
I heard they're deleting...

1466
00:53:47,770 --> 00:53:49,810
Negative Steam reviews too...

1467
00:53:49,810 --> 00:53:52,230
But like... I don't know if that's true...

1468
00:53:52,230 --> 00:53:54,130
I don't know if that's possible...

1469
00:53:54,130 --> 00:53:57,110
Cause like... If you could delete negative Steam reviews...

1470
00:53:57,110 --> 00:53:58,210
I feel like...

1471
00:53:58,210 --> 00:54:00,870
Knowing... I feel like Overwatch 2...

1472
00:54:00,870 --> 00:54:02,570
Would have done that a lot earlier...

1473
00:54:07,530 --> 00:54:09,050
I was like...

1474
00:54:09,050 --> 00:54:11,810
Like if that was possible...

1475
00:54:11,810 --> 00:54:13,290
I feel like... A lot...

1476
00:54:13,390 --> 00:54:15,310
A lot of games would have done it...

1477
00:54:15,310 --> 00:54:17,150
It is...

1478
00:54:17,150 --> 00:54:19,530
It is... Wow...

1479
00:54:19,530 --> 00:54:21,510
Honestly... You should... You might as well...

1480
00:54:21,510 --> 00:54:23,550
Own it... Like... If you're gonna...

00:54:23,550 --> 00:54:25,270
Have... Like... Cause then like...

1482
00:54:25,270 --> 00:54:27,550
At least people would like... Because like...

00:54:28,190 --> 00:54:29,290
You can get a...

1484
00:54:29,290 --> 00:54:31,030
Refund in two hours...

1485
00:54:31,030 --> 00:54:32,410
Like... Why...

1486
00:54:32,410 --> 00:54:35,690
Why are you tricking people to buy your game...

1487
00:54:35,690 --> 00:54:38,410
When you can get a refund in two hours...

1488
00:54:38,410 --> 00:54:39,670
When you can get a refund in two hours...

1489
00:54:40,390 --> 00:54:41,090
When you can get a refund in two hours...

1490
00:54:43,390 --> 00:54:44,090
Like...

1491
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:46,070
Wait... They did?

1492
00:54:46,990 --> 00:54:49,410
Oh my... I love Overwatch by the way...

1493
00:54:49,410 --> 00:54:51,370
But I... Like... Any big...

1494
00:54:51,370 --> 00:54:53,610
The thing is... Any big...

1495
00:54:53,610 --> 00:54:54,910
Multiplayer...

1496
00:54:54,910 --> 00:54:57,370
Game... Will have negative...

1497
00:54:57,370 --> 00:54:59,610
Reviews... On Steam...

1498
00:54:59,610 --> 00:55:01,230
Cause you cannot make...

1499
00:55:01,230 --> 00:55:03,390
Anyone happy... Like...

1500
00:55:03,390 --> 00:55:05,350
It's... It is... 100%...

1501
00:55:05,350 --> 00:55:07,450
If you look up any big...

1502
00:55:07,450 --> 00:55:09,390
Multiplayer game...

1503
00:55:09,390 --> 00:55:10,750
With like...

1504
00:55:10,750 --> 00:55:12,890
With like a ranked competitive system...

1505
00:55:13,530 --> 00:55:14,890
Nobody is...

1506
00:55:14,890 --> 00:55:16,490
Fucking happy... And...

1507
00:55:16,490 --> 00:55:18,770
Somebody will complain...

1508
00:55:22,550 --> 00:55:24,590
It's... Like... Like...

1509
00:55:24,590 --> 00:55:26,930
I swear people will be like... No... You can't say...

1510
00:55:26,930 --> 00:55:28,550
No... That's not true...

1511
00:55:28,550 --> 00:55:30,090
I love... Blah... Blah... Blah...

1512
00:55:30,090 --> 00:55:32,370
If that game is on Steam...

1513
00:55:32,370 --> 00:55:34,770
There is 100%...

1514
00:55:34,770 --> 00:55:37,090
That the reviews would either be like...

1515
00:55:37,090 --> 00:55:38,590
Negative... Or...

1516
00:55:38,590 --> 00:55:40,730
Mix... Because people would be...

1517
00:55:40,750 --> 00:55:41,670
Like... Okay...

1518
00:55:41,670 --> 00:55:45,090
Team Fortress 2 never had a ranked system...

1519
00:55:45,090 --> 00:55:46,470
It never had...

1520
00:55:46,470 --> 00:55:48,470
It never had an actual...

1521
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:50,550
Ranked system... It had like...

1522
00:55:50,550 --> 00:55:52,570
Fun moments... Funny... Ha... Ha...

1523
00:55:52,570 --> 00:55:54,670
Things to do there... But it never...

1524
00:55:54,670 --> 00:55:56,830
Really had a ranked system...

1525
00:55:56,830 --> 00:55:58,930
And... When Team Fortress 2...

1526
00:55:58,930 --> 00:56:00,730
Came on Steam... People...

1527
00:56:00,730 --> 00:56:02,910
Were a lot nicer back then...

1528
00:56:02,910 --> 00:56:04,330
Ha... Ha... Ha...

1529
00:56:05,910 --> 00:56:07,650
Ha... Ha... Ha...

1530
00:56:07,650 --> 00:56:08,830
Ha... Ha... Ha...

1531
00:56:08,830 --> 00:56:10,130
People...

1532
00:56:10,750 --> 00:56:12,330
People were...

1533
00:56:12,330 --> 00:56:14,690
When... People were a lot...

1534
00:56:14,690 --> 00:56:16,810
Nicer... When it came to...

1535
00:56:16,810 --> 00:56:18,650
Like... Online reviews...

1536
00:56:18,650 --> 00:56:20,530
And also they had hats...

1537
00:56:20,530 --> 00:56:22,750
Nobody would complain about a game...

1538
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:24,810
That has hats... Like...

1539
00:56:24,810 --> 00:56:27,030
Ha... Ha... Ha...

1540
00:56:27,030 --> 00:56:27,930
Ha... Ha...

1541
00:56:28,750 --> 00:56:30,250
Like... Apex have...

1542
00:56:30,250 --> 00:56:32,650
Oh... No... When Apex...

1543
00:56:32,650 --> 00:56:34,450
First came on Steam...

1544
00:56:34,450 --> 00:56:36,690
Like... Those reviews were...

1545
00:56:36,690 --> 00:56:38,050
Not great... Like...

1546
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:40,310
I... I... No... No... No...

1547
00:56:40,750 --> 00:56:42,710
I remember... Cause I remember...

1548
00:56:42,710 --> 00:56:44,290
Having forced to...

1549
00:56:44,290 --> 00:56:46,150
Download... Uh...

1550
00:56:46,750 --> 00:56:48,790
Apex... On Steam...

1551
00:56:48,790 --> 00:56:50,790
And it was like... Extremely...

1552
00:56:50,790 --> 00:56:53,230
Negative... The reviews...

1553
00:56:53,230 --> 00:56:54,550
Cause everyone...

1554
00:56:54,550 --> 00:56:56,830
That got fucked over in rank...

1555
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:59,030
Is right there... Ready to complain about it...

1556
00:56:59,030 --> 00:57:00,810
On Steam... Cause if you give people...

1557
00:57:00,810 --> 00:57:02,670
A chance to complain... I.E.

1558
00:57:02,670 --> 00:57:04,550
Me... A platform... Right now...

1559
00:57:04,550 --> 00:57:06,650
Cause we literally spent an hour complaining...

1560
00:57:06,650 --> 00:57:07,650
About everything...

1561
00:57:07,650 --> 00:57:11,950
Ha... Ha... Ha... Ha...

1562
00:57:12,870 --> 00:57:14,150
We will fucking...

1563
00:57:14,150 --> 00:57:16,250
Complain... Like... We will...

1564
00:57:16,250 --> 00:57:18,090
We will complain...

1565
00:57:19,710 --> 00:57:20,270
Um...

1566
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:21,890
But yes... Well... Anyway...

1567
00:57:21,890 --> 00:57:24,230
Welcome to the Tomato Farm everybody...

1568
00:57:24,230 --> 00:57:26,030
Thank you... Thank you for...

1569
00:57:26,030 --> 00:57:28,310
Joining the membership... I really appreciate...

1570
00:57:28,310 --> 00:57:30,270
You guys... Welcome to the farm... And thank you...

1571
00:57:30,270 --> 00:57:32,450
Everybody for the Akasupas... I really...

1572
00:57:32,450 --> 00:57:34,150
I have so many Super Chats...

1573
00:57:34,150 --> 00:57:35,990
To catch up on... I'm so sorry...

1574
00:57:35,990 --> 00:57:38,270
I... I'm so sorry if I didn't...

1575
00:57:38,270 --> 00:57:39,970
Read your... I haven't read a single...

1576
00:57:39,970 --> 00:57:40,870
Super Chat... You know what?

1577
00:57:40,910 --> 00:57:41,910
The next person...

1578
00:57:42,310 --> 00:57:43,110
That gets Super Chats...

1579
00:57:43,110 --> 00:57:46,070
You won the Gotcha... I'm gonna read off...

1580
00:57:46,070 --> 00:57:48,390
Your fucking Super Chat... Right here...

1581
00:57:48,390 --> 00:57:49,730
Right now...

1582
00:57:49,730 --> 00:57:52,210
Give me Titanfall 3... I am so sorry...

1583
00:57:52,210 --> 00:57:53,790
To tell you... But I feel like...

1584
00:57:53,790 --> 00:57:56,270
At this point... It's easier...

1585
00:57:56,270 --> 00:57:58,070
To get a million dollars...

1586
00:57:58,070 --> 00:58:00,550
Than it is to get... To get Titanfall 3...

1587
00:58:00,550 --> 00:58:01,050
Like...

1588
00:58:01,050 --> 00:58:04,270
It's easier to win a lottery...

1589
00:58:04,270 --> 00:58:06,550
Than the other one... Because like...

1590
00:58:06,550 --> 00:58:08,270
I... As long as...

1591
00:58:08,270 --> 00:58:10,250
Apex still makes money... Like...

1592
00:58:10,250 --> 00:58:12,030
I'm sorry... Also... Oh!

1593
00:58:12,310 --> 00:58:14,230
Thank you for the Super Chat...

1594
00:58:14,230 --> 00:58:16,070
Thank you... Thank you... Hi...

1595
00:58:16,070 --> 00:58:18,530
Too bad for the guy below him...

1596
00:58:20,290 --> 00:58:22,110
He did not win...

1597
00:58:22,110 --> 00:58:23,490
The Gotcha...

1598
00:58:24,910 --> 00:58:26,630
Fastest fingers in the West...

1599
00:58:26,630 --> 00:58:27,730
Oh my god... Jenny!

1600
00:58:27,950 --> 00:58:30,510
Thank you for the Akasupa... Thank you... Thank you...

1601
00:58:30,510 --> 00:58:32,410
Alright... This person also won the Gotcha...

1602
00:58:32,410 --> 00:58:34,440
Thank you guys... I really appreciate it...

1603
00:58:35,910 --> 00:58:36,490
Um...

1604
00:58:36,490 --> 00:58:37,730
But yes... Unless...

1605
00:58:37,730 --> 00:58:39,550
You buy EA...

1606
00:58:39,550 --> 00:58:40,910
I apologize...

1607
00:58:40,910 --> 00:58:43,770
But I really don't think we're ever getting Titanfall 3...

1608
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:48,620
Because Apex just makes...

1609
00:58:48,620 --> 00:58:50,940
Way too much money at that point...

1610
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:51,620
Like...

1611
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:54,560
It just...

1612
00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:56,780
As long as it keeps making money...

1613
00:58:56,780 --> 00:58:59,240
As long as you keep buying those skins...

1614
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:00,520
I don't know...

1615
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:02,820
I don't know... Um...

1616
00:59:02,820 --> 00:59:04,980
Because I was a fool...

1617
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:06,740
I was a fool too...

1618
00:59:06,740 --> 00:59:09,180
I used to buy Heirlooms back then...

1619
00:59:09,180 --> 00:59:10,340
Um...

1620
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:13,080
And then like... I realized like...

1621
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:15,060
The Heirlooms were so distracting...

1622
00:59:15,060 --> 00:59:16,720
I... I... I for me...

1623
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:19,000
Like... Because I play Rank a lot...

1624
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,180
I don't like equipping Heirlooms...

1625
00:59:21,180 --> 00:59:23,180
Because like... It's just so...

1626
00:59:23,180 --> 00:59:24,860
Distracting for me... And they're so...

1627
00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:26,500
Fucking... Big...

1628
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:28,960
But... Apex...

1629
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:30,700
If you wanna make a...

1630
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:32,700
Doki Heirloom themed...

1631
00:59:32,700 --> 00:59:35,520
I would equip... I would buy all your Heirlooms...

1632
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:37,160
I would just give back your money...

1633
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:38,480
Hahahaha...

1634
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:40,400
Hahahaha...

1635
00:59:41,780 --> 00:59:42,900
Alright... Anyway...

1636
00:59:43,900 --> 00:59:44,460
Anyway...

1637
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:47,520
Before I give you guys a name...

1638
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:48,600
And a form...

1639
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:50,920
I wanna show you guys the Lunar New Year Merch...

1640
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:53,080
That will be released TM soon...

1641
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:55,560
I don't know when we're gonna be putting it...

1642
00:59:55,560 --> 00:59:57,440
Up on the store...

1643
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:58,820
But like... Um...

1644
00:59:58,820 --> 01:00:00,700
I really really wanna show you guys...

1645
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:01,560
What it is...

1646
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:04,680
But anyway... So...

1647
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:06,540
One of the artists...

1648
01:00:06,540 --> 01:00:08,900
The one of the artists I reached out to...

1649
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:10,780
Like... They didn't know who I was...

1650
01:00:10,780 --> 01:00:12,560
Before... Cause they're like... You know...

1651
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:14,480
Cause they're like... Who the fuck...

1652
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:16,820
Who the fuck...

1653
01:00:16,820 --> 01:00:18,000
Is Doki...

1654
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,860
Um... And then they're like...

1655
01:00:19,860 --> 01:00:20,100
Wait!

1656
01:00:20,180 --> 01:00:22,120
I used to watch your streams...

1657
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:24,560
And they're like... Oh please come to Bilibili...

1658
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:25,960

1771
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:48,360
And like... Oh my God...

1772
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:50,600
They were so fast...

1773
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:52,900

1774
01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:54,360

One singular keycap design...

1840
01:06:01,540 --> 01:06:03,500
So it's not a keyboard set...

1841
01:06:03,740 --> 01:06:04,700
Or a keycap set...

1842
01:06:04,700 --> 01:06:06,940

01:06:11,240 --> 01:06:12,800
Where it's like laser engraved...

1846
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:15,520
So that light will... It'll be like my face...

1847
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:17,640
And then like light can shine...

1848
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:19,500
Through it... Past the line...

1849
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:20,960
Alright... So stuff like that...

1850
01:06:21,980 --> 01:06:23,200
Um... So yeah...

1851
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:26,160
Artisan keycap... It'll be one artisan keycap...

1852
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:27,680
Design that I'm working on...

1853
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:29,620
Right now... Um... Trying to find a...

1854
01:06:29,620 --> 01:06:32,020
Manufacturer... Also like all these...

1855
01:06:32,020 --> 01:06:33,540
Stuff... All these merch...

1856
01:06:33,740 --> 01:06:35,460
I personally find the...

1857
01:06:35,460 --> 01:06:37,260
Manufacturers... And...

1858
01:06:37,260 --> 01:06:39,560
I personally reach out to... Like...

1859
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:41,480
Research like manufacturers and stuff...

1860
01:06:41,480 --> 01:06:43,340
Or like samples and everything...

1861
01:06:43,340 --> 01:06:45,480
And also... Um... I...

1862
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:47,740
Reach out to artists that... That would...

1863
01:06:47,740 --> 01:06:49,760
I think would make these... Like...

1864
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:51,960
I reach out to artists that I think...

1865
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:53,420
Would do it justice...

1866
01:06:53,420 --> 01:06:55,740
Type deal... But yeah... I'm doing the next merch...

1867
01:06:55,740 --> 01:06:57,920
Drop... Drop... Not anytime...

1868
01:06:57,920 --> 01:06:59,660
Soon by the way... Will be an...

1869
01:06:59,660 --> 01:07:01,800
Artisan keycap... Which is something I've always...

1870
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:03,620
Wanted to get... That made...

1871
01:07:03,740 --> 01:07:05,280
Um... And...

1872
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:08,080
I'm super... Super duper excited...

1873
01:07:08,080 --> 01:07:09,660
And everything... So yeah...

1874
01:07:09,660 --> 01:07:12,020
Just something to look forward to... Very slowly...

1875
01:07:12,020 --> 01:07:13,620
And honestly like doing this...

1876
01:07:13,620 --> 01:07:16,140
Is also like... Stuff I want...

1877
01:07:16,140 --> 01:07:17,120
Of myself... So...

1878
01:07:17,350 --> 01:07:17,760
Hahahaha...

1879
01:07:21,100 --> 01:07:21,920
Hahahaha...

1880
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:23,460
You know...

1881
01:07:23,460 --> 01:07:25,620
I like... I wanna look...

1882
01:07:25,620 --> 01:07:27,960
At myself more... So then I was like...

1883
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:29,580
These are things I want...

1884
01:07:29,580 --> 01:07:31,340
Personally... So like...

1885
01:07:31,340 --> 01:07:33,460
So I... These are...

1886
01:07:33,740 --> 01:07:35,720
Um... But usually... You can...

1887
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:37,160
You have to buy... Like...

1888
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:40,040
You have to buy a minimum amount of stock...

1889
01:07:40,040 --> 01:07:41,740
So like... It's a good benefit...

1890
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:43,840
Because I can...

1891
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:44,820
Hahahaha...

1892
01:07:45,620 --> 01:07:47,920
I can... Acquire...

1893
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:49,300
These items...

1894
01:07:49,300 --> 01:07:51,700
Um... And not have to worry...

1895
01:07:51,700 --> 01:07:53,640
About the extra stock...

1896
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:54,520
Like... I can...

1897
01:07:54,520 --> 01:07:57,720
Hahahaha... Because when you get things...

1898
01:07:57,720 --> 01:07:59,640
Manufactured... Usually...

1899
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:01,680
It's a minimum amount that...

1900
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:03,660
You need to order... Because I remember...

1901
01:08:03,740 --> 01:08:05,380
When I was trying to order... Like...

1902
01:08:05,380 --> 01:08:07,180
I was talking to manufacturers...

1903
01:08:07,180 --> 01:08:09,260
For like... Red pocket envelopes...

1904
01:08:09,260 --> 01:08:11,000
They were like... Um...

1905
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,120
Yeah... But you have... I was like...

1906
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:15,240
Can you like... Make like...

1907
01:08:15,240 --> 01:08:17,620
A hundred... And they were like...

1908
01:08:17,620 --> 01:08:20,020
Minimum order... A thousand...

1909
01:08:20,020 --> 01:08:21,060
Hahahaha...

1910
01:08:25,990 --> 01:08:27,790
I was like... Oh...

1911
01:08:27,790 --> 01:08:29,690
Thank god... Thank god...

1912
01:08:29,690 --> 01:08:31,550
I have an audience now...

1913
01:08:31,550 --> 01:08:34,090
So I can get away with that...

1914
01:08:34,090 --> 01:08:36,150
I was like... They're like... Minimum order...

1915
01:08:36,150 --> 01:08:38,470
One thousand...

1916
01:08:38,470 --> 01:08:39,730
I'm like... What the fuck?

1917
01:08:40,390 --> 01:08:42,090
Wow... Oh god...

1918
01:08:42,090 --> 01:08:43,730
That's a lot...

1919
01:08:45,350 --> 01:08:45,910
Um...

1920
01:08:45,910 --> 01:08:47,870
Um... So yeah... I was just like...

1921
01:08:47,870 --> 01:08:49,250
Oh thank fucking god...

1922
01:08:49,250 --> 01:08:52,530
At least I can sell my extra stock...

1923
01:08:52,530 --> 01:08:53,790
That I'm not gonna keep...

1924
01:08:54,570 --> 01:08:55,130
Hahahaha...

1925
01:08:56,690 --> 01:08:57,250
Hahahaha...

1926
01:08:57,250 --> 01:08:59,590
No... It's not like... It's not about like...

1927
01:08:59,590 --> 01:09:01,050
I can afford it... It's more like...

1928
01:09:01,050 --> 01:09:03,970
If I didn't... You know... If I didn't...

1929
01:09:03,970 --> 01:09:05,930
Have a fan base... Or if I didn't...

1930
01:09:06,150 --> 01:09:07,810
Have an audience... I was like...

1931
01:09:07,810 --> 01:09:09,410
What the fuck am I gonna do...

1932
01:09:09,410 --> 01:09:11,910

I'm super excited to like...

1971
01:10:24,070 --> 01:10:26,330
Work with other distributors... You know...

01:10:26,330 --> 01:10:28,310

1973
01:10:28,310 --> 01:10:30,350

1975
01:10:32,110 --> 01:10:34,250
You know... The one thing...

01:10:36,830 --> 01:10:38,150
I'm gonna tweet... Wait where's my...

1978
01:10:38,150 --> 01:10:39,770
I'm gonna tweet that out... But...

1979
01:10:39,770 --> 01:10:41,550
I'm gonna add Funko Pop and...

1980
01:10:47,030 --> 01:10:48,070
Alright guys...

1981
01:10:48,070 --> 01:10:50,290
My dream collab...

1982
01:10:50,290 --> 01:10:52,590
Would be a Funko Pop...

1983
01:10:53,850 --> 01:10:55,910
And an android... But like...

1984
01:10:55,910 --> 01:10:58,290
I feel like it's more... It's easier...

1985
01:10:58,310 --> 01:11:00,590
Maybe... To get a Funko Pop...

1986
01:11:00,590 --> 01:11:02,310
Than it is to get a nendoroid...

1987
01:11:02,310 --> 01:11:04,290
Okay... Hear me out...

1988
01:11:04,290 --> 01:11:06,050
Hear me out...

1989
01:11:06,050 --> 01:11:08,790
Why I would wanna get a Funko Pop...

1990
01:11:08,790 --> 01:11:10,710
You have to think of it...

1991
01:11:10,850 --> 01:11:12,330
Business wise...

1992
01:11:12,950 --> 01:11:14,030
Just think of...

1993
01:11:14,030 --> 01:11:16,710
Think about it... Business wise...

1994
01:11:16,710 --> 01:11:17,690
Why...

1995
01:11:18,030 --> 01:11:20,730
A Funko Pop would be so funny...

1996
01:11:20,730 --> 01:11:22,170
But basically...

1997
01:11:22,170 --> 01:11:24,150
The thing about...

1998
01:11:24,150 --> 01:11:26,150
Funko Pop collectors...

1999
01:11:26,150 --> 01:11:27,510
Is that...

2000
01:11:28,310 --> 01:11:28,610
They...

2001
01:11:28,610 --> 01:11:30,710
Will fucking buy...

2002
01:11:30,710 --> 01:11:33,410
Every single Funko Pop...

2003
01:11:33,410 --> 01:11:35,730
To complete their collection...

2004
01:11:35,730 --> 01:11:37,390
It doesn't matter...

2005
01:11:37,390 --> 01:11:40,770
If they don't know who that person is...

2006
01:11:40,770 --> 01:11:42,230
They are...

2007
01:11:42,230 --> 01:11:44,550
Insane collectors...

2008
01:11:44,550 --> 01:11:45,790
That will collect...

2009
01:11:45,930 --> 01:11:48,350
Every fucking Funko Pop...

2010
01:11:48,350 --> 01:11:49,210
Out there...

2011
01:11:49,210 --> 01:11:52,530
So then... They're gonna see a Doki Funko Pop...

2012
01:11:52,530 --> 01:11:53,970
And then they'll be like...

2013
01:11:53,970 --> 01:11:56,110
Who the fuck is Doki Bird?

2014
01:11:56,110 --> 01:11:58,250
I must have her in my collection...

2015
01:11:58,730 --> 01:11:59,470
And then...

2016
01:12:00,070 --> 01:12:00,530
Normies...

2017
01:12:00,530 --> 01:12:02,130
My OBS disconnected...

2018
01:12:02,130 --> 01:12:06,110
Holy shit...

2019
01:12:08,010 --> 01:12:11,010
My OBS disconnected...

2020
01:12:11,010 --> 01:12:13,350
While I was talking about...

2021
01:12:13,350 --> 01:12:14,590
Funko Pop...

2022
01:12:18,570 --> 01:12:19,490
Anyway...

2023
01:12:20,650 --> 01:12:21,570
Anyway...

2024
01:12:21,570 --> 01:12:23,110
As I was saying...

2025
01:12:23,110 --> 01:12:25,430
As I was saying...

2026
01:12:25,430 --> 01:12:26,090
As I was saying...

2027
01:12:26,110 --> 01:12:27,770
You have to understand...

2028
01:12:27,770 --> 01:12:29,770
Like... Normies...

2029
01:12:29,770 --> 01:12:31,890
Would be like... Would see that...

2030
01:12:31,890 --> 01:12:34,490
At like... Fucking GameStop...

2031
01:12:34,490 --> 01:12:36,170
Because who the fuck buys games...

2032
01:12:36,170 --> 01:12:37,090
At GameStop...

2033
01:12:37,090 --> 01:12:37,490
Like...

2034
01:12:40,910 --> 01:12:42,350
Every fucking...

2035
01:12:42,750 --> 01:12:44,590
And conventions...

2036
01:12:44,590 --> 01:12:46,010
There's always...

2037
01:12:46,010 --> 01:12:48,110
10 to 20...

2038
01:12:48,110 --> 01:12:48,930
Sellers...

2039
01:12:48,930 --> 01:12:50,850
Selling Funko Pops...

2040
01:12:50,850 --> 01:12:53,010
And only Funko Pops...

2041
01:12:53,010 --> 01:12:53,450
So...

2042
01:12:53,450 --> 01:12:56,070
A Doki Funko Pop...

2043
01:12:56,070 --> 01:12:57,910
Would be everywhere...

2044
01:12:57,910 --> 01:12:59,870
It'll be mainstream...

2045
01:12:59,870 --> 01:13:01,690
It'll be a hot topic...

2046
01:13:01,690 --> 01:13:04,430
Imagine going to a hot topic store...

2047
01:13:04,430 --> 01:13:06,790
And seeing a Doki Funko Pop...

2048
01:13:06,790 --> 01:13:09,030
Like... You barely find anime stores...

2049
01:13:09,030 --> 01:13:11,150
Because like... People just order online...

2050
01:13:11,150 --> 01:13:13,090
People don't really order online...

2051
01:13:13,090 --> 01:13:14,550
For Funko Pops...

2052
01:13:14,550 --> 01:13:16,790
They fucking go to Hot Topic...

2053
01:13:16,790 --> 01:13:17,910
Or Walmart...

2054
01:13:17,910 --> 01:13:19,870
I could be in Walmart...

2055
01:13:19,870 --> 01:13:21,610
I could be...

2056
01:13:24,530 --> 01:13:27,130
I could be in fucking Walmart...

2057
01:13:27,130 --> 01:13:28,270
I could be in fucking Walmart...

2058
01:13:28,270 --> 01:13:30,490
A Walmart exclusive...

2059
01:13:30,490 --> 01:13:31,550
Just like think about...

2060
01:13:31,550 --> 01:13:34,670
The Doki flocked version...

2061
01:13:34,670 --> 01:13:36,870
I could have like multiple versions...

2062
01:13:36,870 --> 01:13:38,010
Of myself...

2063
01:13:38,010 --> 01:13:39,470
In Funko Pop...

2064
01:13:39,470 --> 01:13:41,010
And like...

2065
01:13:41,010 --> 01:13:44,370
It could be like the Doki Metallic...

2066
01:13:44,370 --> 01:13:46,250
Walmart exclusive...

2067
01:13:46,250 --> 01:13:48,390
Just... Business wise...

2068
01:13:48,390 --> 01:13:50,930
It is the smartest thing I can ever do...

2069
01:13:50,930 --> 01:13:51,750
Like...

2070
01:13:54,830 --> 01:13:55,270
Like...

2071
01:13:55,710 --> 01:13:57,390
Think about it...

2072
01:13:57,590 --> 01:13:58,730
No... The Doki...

2073
01:13:58,730 --> 01:14:00,010
The original Doki...

2074
01:14:00,010 --> 01:14:01,810
Would be... Oh my god...

2075
01:14:01,810 --> 01:14:04,470
Thank you for the 50 conditions...

2076
01:14:04,750 --> 01:14:05,670
Thank you...

2077
01:14:05,670 --> 01:14:07,950
Thank you so much...

2078
01:14:07,950 --> 01:14:10,810
Like... I kept different exclusives...

2079
01:14:10,810 --> 01:14:12,490
In different stores...

2080
01:14:12,490 --> 01:14:15,290
So like... The Doki Metallic version...

2081
01:14:15,290 --> 01:14:16,890
Will be in Spencer's...

2082
01:14:16,890 --> 01:14:19,390
The Doki flocked version...

2083
01:14:19,690 --> 01:14:21,290
Will be at Toys R Us...

2084
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:22,450
Only in Canada...

2085
01:14:23,010 --> 01:14:24,290
Because Toys R Us is apparently...

2086
01:14:25,010 --> 01:14:26,450
Bankrupt in America...

2087
01:14:27,450 --> 01:14:28,210
I...

2088
01:14:28,210 --> 01:14:30,050
The fucking...

2089
01:14:30,730 --> 01:14:31,110
The...

2090
01:14:32,170 --> 01:14:34,430
The 2 feet tall...

2091
01:14:34,690 --> 01:14:36,210
Doki Funko Pop...

2092
01:14:36,990 --> 01:14:37,370
Exclusive...

2093
01:14:37,370 --> 01:14:39,890
At Target...

2094
01:14:39,890 --> 01:14:42,450
Just imagine the possibility...

2095
01:14:42,450 --> 01:14:45,270
And then they can make different outfits...

2096
01:14:45,270 --> 01:14:47,350
Normies will have to collect me...

2097
01:14:47,350 --> 01:14:48,450
Because they need to collect...

2098
01:14:48,450 --> 01:14:50,850
All the fucking Funko Pops in the world...

2099
01:14:50,850 --> 01:14:51,650
So like...

2100
01:14:53,010 --> 01:14:54,170
To look at me...

2101
01:14:54,170 --> 01:14:55,810
And then maybe they'll look me up...

2102
01:14:55,810 --> 01:14:56,130
You know...

2103
01:14:56,130 --> 01:14:59,510
Maybe I'm not just a Funko Pop in their collection...

2104
01:14:59,510 --> 01:15:02,010
Maybe they'll just look me up as well...

2105
01:15:02,010 --> 01:15:03,930
And then they become fans of me...

2106
01:15:03,930 --> 01:15:04,550
Um...

2107
01:15:06,750 --> 01:15:09,050
And that is why...

2108
01:15:09,050 --> 01:15:10,530
Funko Pop...

2109
01:15:10,530 --> 01:15:12,890
Is my dream collaboration...

2110
01:15:12,890 --> 01:15:14,370
And also Nendoroids...

2111
01:15:14,370 --> 01:15:15,090
Because like...

2112
01:15:15,090 --> 01:15:17,030
That's obviously a better thing...

2113
01:15:17,930 --> 01:15:18,490
But...

2114
01:15:20,330 --> 01:15:21,650
And the thing is...

2115
01:15:23,010 --> 01:15:25,510
Because Nendoroids are very picky on who they pick...

2116
01:15:25,510 --> 01:15:27,090
To make into a figure...

2117
01:15:27,090 --> 01:15:28,450
Funko Pop...

2118
01:15:28,630 --> 01:15:31,390
They love making Funko Pops...

2119
01:15:31,530 --> 01:15:33,890
They love making Funko Pops...

2120
01:15:33,890 --> 01:15:36,250
So there is a higher chance...

2121
01:15:36,250 --> 01:15:37,110
There is a...

2122
01:15:37,110 --> 01:15:38,850
Higher chance...

2123
01:15:38,850 --> 01:15:40,010
Of me...

2124
01:15:40,010 --> 01:15:42,910
Being picked up by Funko Pop...

2125
01:15:42,910 --> 01:15:45,090
Than it is to be picked up...

2126
01:15:45,090 --> 01:15:47,010
By Nendoroids...

2127
01:15:48,810 --> 01:15:51,030
Because they love making...

2128
01:15:51,570 --> 01:15:52,470
They love...

2129
01:15:53,010 --> 01:15:54,410
The things...

2130
01:15:54,830 --> 01:15:55,210
So...

2131
01:15:55,210 --> 01:15:57,210
That's my TED Talk...

2132
01:15:57,210 --> 01:15:59,210
That is my...

2133
01:15:59,210 --> 01:16:02,610
That is my TED Talk...

2134
01:16:02,610 --> 01:16:04,310
For Funko Pop of the day...

2135
01:16:04,310 --> 01:16:04,770
Anyway...

2136
01:16:04,770 --> 01:16:06,850
I'm going to tweet at Funko Pop real quick...

2137
01:16:06,850 --> 01:16:07,650

I tweeted at Funko Pop...

2156
01:17:03,770 --> 01:17:05,690
I hope that maybe they'll...

2157
01:17:05,690 --> 01:17:07,970
Maybe they'll see this and be like...

2158
01:17:07,970 --> 01:17:09,390
Who the fuck is she?

2159
01:17:13,890 --> 01:17:15,490
Oh my god...

2160
01:17:16,250 --> 01:17:16,950
Anyway...

2161
01:17:16,950 --> 01:17:17,910

Wait no...

I'm not even their first Vtuber...

2170
01:17:29,390 --> 01:17:30,590

2172
01:17:33,110 --> 01:17:34,450
I don't even know...

2173
01:17:34,450 --> 01:17:36,410
They have so many Funko Pops...

2174
01:17:36,410 --> 01:17:37,870
That I don't even know...

2175
01:17:37,870 --> 01:17:41,290
If they already made a Funko Pop...

2176
01:17:41,290 --> 01:17:43,510

01:17:43,510 --> 01:17:45,650

That is why...

2197
01:18:23,070 --> 01:18:25,890
Funko Pop is my dream collab...

2198
01:18:26,150 --> 01:18:26,930
Anyway...

01:18:26,930 --> 01:18:29,010

01:18:29,010 --> 01:18:31,010
I was supposed to...

2201
01:18:32,150 --> 01:18:32,950

01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:01,300
We'll have four...

2403
01:26:01,300 --> 01:26:03,500
Four choices for the polls.

2404
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:07,920
What is the third option you guys want to add in?

2405
01:26:10,100 --> 01:26:10,620
Tomotori?

2406
01:26:11,940 --> 01:26:12,460
Tomotori?

2407
01:26:12,640 --> 01:26:13,160
Tomotori?

2408
01:26:13,420 --> 01:26:14,080
Hello Tomotori.

2409
01:26:14,140 --> 01:26:15,380
No, I'm vetoing Tomotori.

2410
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:16,620
I like two syllables.

2411
01:26:16,980 --> 01:26:17,800
Alright, guys.

2412
01:26:18,240 --> 01:26:19,700
I'm going to be real with you.

2413
01:26:19,780 --> 01:26:20,580
Two syllables.

2414
01:26:21,120 --> 01:26:22,180
Oh, damn it.

2415
01:26:25,300 --> 01:26:32,680
I feel like two syllables is like the perfect amount of syllables when it comes to like names.

2416
01:26:32,940 --> 01:26:34,080
Like Doki.

2417
01:26:34,360 --> 01:26:35,020
You know?

2418
01:26:35,580 --> 01:26:37,500
And the other one.

2419
01:26:37,820 --> 01:26:40,680
Like two syllables is like the best.

2420
01:26:43,640 --> 01:26:44,280
Nesties?

2421
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:45,120
Oh my god.

2422
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:47,200
We are not going to be nest...

2423
01:26:47,200 --> 01:26:47,420
Okay.

2424
01:26:47,700 --> 01:26:48,340
Guys.

2425
01:26:48,960 --> 01:26:49,280
Alright.

2426
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:50,720
Alright.

2427
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:52,960
I'm going to put the poll up.

2428
01:26:53,040 --> 01:26:54,700
I mean, how do I put the poll up?

2429
01:26:54,780 --> 01:26:55,340
It's been a while.

2430
01:26:55,460 --> 01:26:55,720
Okay.

2431
01:26:55,780 --> 01:26:56,060
Poll.

2432
01:26:56,480 --> 01:26:56,960
Alright.

2433
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:58,960
Add option.

2434
01:26:59,080 --> 01:26:59,880
Add option.

2435
01:27:00,120 --> 01:27:00,360
Okay.

2436
01:27:00,440 --> 01:27:00,820
Here we go.

2437
01:27:03,400 --> 01:27:03,880
Naming.

2438
01:27:03,900 --> 01:27:04,380
Okay.

2439
01:27:04,440 --> 01:27:08,480
I might like start moving weirdly because I don't know where my bindings are.

2440
01:27:08,620 --> 01:27:09,560
Naming ceremony.

2441
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:15,040
Okay.

2442
01:27:16,100 --> 01:27:16,580
Okay.

2443
01:27:17,640 --> 01:27:19,720
The first one is...

2444
01:27:20,220 --> 01:27:20,700
I'm going to be...

2445
01:27:23,320 --> 01:27:23,880
Suspects.

2446
01:27:24,220 --> 01:27:24,780
Right?

2447
01:27:26,320 --> 01:27:27,700
Suspects with a K.

2448
01:27:27,760 --> 01:27:28,660
Ends with a K.

2449
01:27:28,660 --> 01:27:29,120
I think.

2450
01:27:29,560 --> 01:27:30,480
Oh my god.

2451
01:27:30,500 --> 01:27:33,160
The chat is so laggy when it comes to typing.

2452
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:34,220
There's so many.

2453
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:39,160
Thank you everybody for watching little old me.

2454
01:27:40,060 --> 01:27:40,940
Oh my god.

2455
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:41,840
Thank you everyone.

2456
01:27:43,720 --> 01:27:44,460
Let's see.

2457
01:27:44,980 --> 01:27:45,540
Okay.

2458
01:27:46,100 --> 01:27:46,820
Let's see.

2459
01:27:47,400 --> 01:27:47,960
Liberties.

2460
01:27:48,780 --> 01:27:49,340
Liberties.

2461
01:27:49,340 --> 01:27:50,060
Look guys.

2462
01:27:50,060 --> 01:27:52,400
As much as I love to be like America.

2463
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:54,240
I'm not American.

2464
01:27:57,320 --> 01:27:58,040
Robins.

2465
01:27:58,900 --> 01:28:00,080
Hello Robins.

2466
01:28:00,760 --> 01:28:02,120
Hello Robins.

2467
01:28:02,180 --> 01:28:03,740
My little Robin.

2468
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:04,920
God.

2469
01:28:04,940 --> 01:28:05,920
That name is just like Batman.

2470
01:28:06,600 --> 01:28:07,900
I'm just...

2471
01:28:07,900 --> 01:28:08,980
I'm just...

2472
01:28:08,980 --> 01:28:11,800
Then it just goes into Batman and Robin.

2473
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:13,040
Doki and Robin.

2474
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:16,640
Okay.

2475
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:19,960
Tori Bird.

2476
01:28:20,060 --> 01:28:22,420
So you guys can be like Bird Bird.

2477
01:28:22,940 --> 01:28:24,160
Tori Birb.

2478
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:25,700
Tori Birbs.

2479
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:28,080
Okay.

2480
01:28:28,340 --> 01:28:29,120
Let's see.

2481
01:28:29,480 --> 01:28:30,640
It should be a capital T.

2482
01:28:30,840 --> 01:28:31,560
All right.

2483
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:35,640
Nest...

2484
01:28:35,640 --> 01:28:37,320
We're not going to be Nesticles.

2485
01:28:37,680 --> 01:28:38,700
I am...

2486
01:28:38,700 --> 01:28:41,360
I have like unlimited veto power.

2487
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:46,360
And definitely one of my unlimited veto power is fucking Nesticles.

2488
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:49,060
And also Free Bird.

2489
01:28:49,400 --> 01:28:50,040
Oh my god.

2490
01:28:50,040 --> 01:28:50,280
Oh my god.

2491
01:28:50,280 --> 01:28:50,420
Uh...

2492
01:28:50,420 --> 01:28:51,640
Toma Tori.

2493
01:28:52,060 --> 01:28:53,180
Toma Tori.

2494
01:28:53,480 --> 01:28:55,460
Hello Tomatori's Hooters.

2495
01:28:55,580 --> 01:28:56,100
We're not...

2496
01:28:56,100 --> 01:28:56,660
I am...

2497
01:28:56,660 --> 01:28:59,720
I know that put Hooters in the poll as a fucking joke.

2498
01:29:03,160 --> 01:29:06,600
I'm not gonna call you guys my little hooters.

2499
01:29:06,720 --> 01:29:17,420
I am not gonna call you guys my little hooters because that has a different implication.

2500
01:29:17,800 --> 01:29:21,580
Funko Pop will never sponsor me if I call you guys hooters.

2501
01:29:22,740 --> 01:29:25,040
Think of the Funko Pop, guys.

2502
01:29:25,880 --> 01:29:27,500
Think of the Funko Pop.

2503
01:29:34,260 --> 01:29:35,560
Let's see...

2504
01:29:40,760 --> 01:29:44,480
Eagles, Nightwing... today is such a sad day.

2505
01:29:44,660 --> 01:29:51,240
Just because you don't get Nesticles or Hooters doesn't mean it's a sad day, guys.

2506
01:29:51,760 --> 01:29:54,600
There are other options here.

2507
01:29:56,120 --> 01:29:57,480
There are other options here.

2508
01:29:57,500 --> 01:29:57,960
There are other options.

2509
01:29:58,380 --> 01:29:59,840
Okay, I see a lot of Tomotories.

2510
01:30:00,040 --> 01:30:00,980
Okay, I'll put that in.

2511
01:30:01,580 --> 01:30:04,160
Tomotory, Tomotory...

2512
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:05,260
And then...

2513
01:30:05,260 --> 01:30:08,540
For the surprise fourth option...

2514
01:30:08,540 --> 01:30:11,500
I thought about it a very long time.

2515
01:30:11,740 --> 01:30:13,700
And to be fair...

2516
01:30:16,200 --> 01:30:18,020
This is the surprise option.

2517
01:30:18,560 --> 01:30:21,580
I thought about it for a very long time.

2518
01:30:22,300 --> 01:30:24,240
But I realized...

2519
01:30:24,240 --> 01:30:25,920
Wait a minute...

2520
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:27,480
You can't come...

2521
01:30:27,500 --> 01:30:28,860
Copyright the word...

2522
01:30:28,860 --> 01:30:29,660
Dragoons.

2523
01:30:33,980 --> 01:30:36,280
Because it's a real word.

2524
01:30:38,960 --> 01:30:40,040
And...

2525
01:30:40,040 --> 01:30:42,540
If Dragoons win...

2526
01:30:42,540 --> 01:30:45,420
It's like crocodiles and alligators.

2527
01:30:45,740 --> 01:30:46,600
You know?

2528
01:30:46,640 --> 01:30:50,220
A crocodile was still called a crocodile...

2529
01:30:50,220 --> 01:30:52,400
Millions of years ago.

2530
01:30:55,260 --> 01:30:58,840
It was still called a crocodile...

2531
01:30:59,700 --> 01:31:01,300
Millions of years ago.

2532
01:31:01,640 --> 01:31:03,680
But it just evolved.

2533
01:31:04,080 --> 01:31:04,520
You know?

2534
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:09,420
It evolved.

2535
01:31:11,620 --> 01:31:14,580
So all I'm saying is that...

2536
01:31:14,580 --> 01:31:18,160
What I'm thinking of when it comes to Dragoons...

2537
01:31:18,160 --> 01:31:20,820
It's like a military unit.

2538
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:27,040
And honestly, you know...

2539
01:31:27,040 --> 01:31:27,760
Obviously...

2540
01:31:27,760 --> 01:31:29,980
Why did I think about Dragoons?

2541
01:31:30,080 --> 01:31:32,120
Because I was like...

2542
01:31:32,120 --> 01:31:32,920
Oh my god!

2543
01:31:33,500 --> 01:31:35,120
It's like Starcraft.

2544
01:31:35,440 --> 01:31:35,800
You know?

2545
01:31:35,980 --> 01:31:37,740
Starcraft is my favorite game.

2546
01:31:39,820 --> 01:31:40,460
Anyway...

2547
01:31:40,460 --> 01:31:42,600
Obviously, it's a surprise fourth option.

2548
01:31:42,980 --> 01:31:45,740
It's like a surprise fourth option.

2549
01:31:47,160 --> 01:31:47,800
Okay.

2550
01:31:49,580 --> 01:31:50,780
Alright, here we go.

2551
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:55,780
Alright, here's the pull.

2552
01:31:57,120 --> 01:31:58,580
Here's the pull.

2553
01:32:02,620 --> 01:32:05,500
Nesticles is officially out and running.

2554
01:32:08,660 --> 01:32:09,780
Nesticles is officially...

2555
01:32:10,420 --> 01:32:11,120
Oh my god!

2556
01:32:11,180 --> 01:32:12,460
It's so laggy in chat.

2557
01:32:12,540 --> 01:32:16,360
I felt like it took an entire minute for this to load.

2558
01:32:22,120 --> 01:32:26,400
nesticles presidente el tiempo Juanita Salom très So...

2559
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:30,780
So, here we go.

2560
01:32:31,120 --> 01:32:33,680
Fight, fight, fight for your name!

2561
01:32:34,340 --> 01:32:36,240
Fight for your name!

2562
01:32:37,040 --> 01:32:39,340
No, Nesticles, my beloved!

2563
01:32:39,660 --> 01:32:42,960
Look, you guys had like...

2564
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:43,520
Oh my god!

2565
01:32:51,450 --> 01:32:54,670
Oh my god, you guys like fought so hard.

2566
01:32:56,530 --> 01:33:01,070
For those that wanted to be Nesticles, look guys...

2567
01:33:02,250 --> 01:33:07,610
Nesticles, you guys could have pretended to be Nesticles when you guys had no name, okay?

2568
01:33:07,730 --> 01:33:08,890
That's not my fault.

2569
01:33:08,990 --> 01:33:13,730
You had the freedom to be a Nesticle for like six days now, okay?

2570
01:33:16,250 --> 01:33:20,150
You guys all had the freedom to be a Nesticle for six days!

2571
01:33:20,530 --> 01:33:23,050
Those might have been the best six days of your life.

2572
01:33:23,250 --> 01:33:25,950
But now it's time to be renamed, okay?

2573
01:33:26,390 --> 01:33:26,910
Now...

2574
01:33:26,910 --> 01:33:29,070
Now it's time to be renamed.

2575
01:33:29,330 --> 01:33:32,590
Everyone had six days to...

2576
01:33:34,140 --> 01:33:37,210
Had six days to be whatever the fuck they are.

2577
01:33:39,030 --> 01:33:40,790
Oh my god.

2578
01:33:45,010 --> 01:33:46,370
I love...

2579
01:33:46,370 --> 01:33:48,410
I love how...

2580
01:33:48,410 --> 01:33:51,530
Like, I could have just said Dragoons in the very beginning.

2581
01:33:51,950 --> 01:33:53,950
But I made you guys...

2582
01:33:53,950 --> 01:33:56,490
That's typical Doki version.

2583
01:33:56,490 --> 01:34:06,130
I made you guys fight amongst yourselves for like six plus days, deciding a new fan name for yourself.

2584
01:34:06,530 --> 01:34:08,890
And then I'm like, J.K.

2585
01:34:09,870 --> 01:34:11,530
Dragoons is an actual word.

2586
01:34:18,610 --> 01:34:29,730
I strung you along for six days, yelling at each other, trying to figure out what your new name was going to be.

2587
01:34:30,150 --> 01:34:31,870
But don't worry guys.

2588
01:34:32,890 --> 01:34:34,570
Dragoons can evolve.

2589
01:34:35,130 --> 01:34:36,870
Like all dinosaurs...

2590
01:34:36,870 --> 01:34:40,890
All dinosaurs eventually evolved into birds.

2591
01:34:41,210 --> 01:34:42,630
Which is, you know...

2592
01:34:43,530 --> 01:34:44,690
It was...

2593
01:34:44,690 --> 01:34:45,650
It was like...

2594
01:34:45,650 --> 01:34:48,910
It was like we wrote three pages of names.

2595
01:34:53,210 --> 01:34:54,390
I guess we're done.

2596
01:34:54,390 --> 01:34:55,390
Somebody was like...

2597
01:34:55,390 --> 01:35:00,990
It was like, Doki, we worked so hard coming up with all these names.

2598
01:35:06,170 --> 01:35:06,910
We worked...

2599
01:35:06,910 --> 01:35:13,110
We worked so hard coming up with all of these names, Doki.

2600
01:35:18,130 --> 01:35:20,150
I can't believe it.

2601
01:35:20,230 --> 01:35:22,610
Alright, I'll do one more poll for you guys.

2602
01:35:22,610 --> 01:35:26,490
I'll do one more poll for you guys.

2603
01:35:26,690 --> 01:35:31,230
Because obviously, we'll have the two finalists fight each other.

2604
01:35:31,370 --> 01:35:33,290
For like, the true winner.

2605
01:35:33,490 --> 01:35:34,630
The true winner.

2606
01:35:35,630 --> 01:35:36,890
We'll have...

2607
01:35:37,610 --> 01:35:38,390
Naming ceremony.

2608
01:35:39,950 --> 01:35:40,750
Naming...

2609
01:35:41,530 --> 01:35:41,930
Ceremony.

2610
01:35:43,950 --> 01:35:44,750
Alright.

2611
01:35:47,090 --> 01:35:47,890
Dragoons...

2612
01:35:48,610 --> 01:35:49,470
Versus...

2613
01:35:49,470 --> 01:35:50,570
Suspects.

2614
01:35:52,610 --> 01:35:54,290
We just all evolved, you know?

2615
01:35:54,570 --> 01:35:55,550
We just...

2616
01:35:55,550 --> 01:35:56,370
We're just evolving.

2617
01:35:58,630 --> 01:36:02,050
The closest ancestor to dinos...

2618
01:36:02,290 --> 01:36:03,810
If you guys didn't know...

2619
01:36:03,810 --> 01:36:04,990
Are birds.

2620
01:36:05,710 --> 01:36:06,610
It's just...

2621
01:36:06,610 --> 01:36:08,330
We're just evolving, everyone.

2622
01:36:08,350 --> 01:36:09,470
We're just evolving.

2623
01:36:11,090 --> 01:36:15,170
Enough years have passed by for evolution to take in its effect.

2624
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:22,200
Alright, here we go.

2625
01:36:22,380 --> 01:36:25,580
Give us a fact that I refuse to vote.

2626
01:36:25,580 --> 01:36:28,700
I will only vote if it's nesticles.

2627
01:36:28,920 --> 01:36:30,300
Well then, he's gotta...

2628
01:36:30,300 --> 01:36:31,400
He's gotta be...

2629
01:36:31,400 --> 01:36:32,380
Well...

2630
01:36:32,380 --> 01:36:34,160
Thank god for that.

2631
01:36:34,480 --> 01:36:36,860
Thank god we vetoed nesticles.

2632
01:36:39,460 --> 01:36:41,480
Oh, this is really close though.

2633
01:36:41,760 --> 01:36:45,320
This is actually really, really close.

2634
01:36:45,380 --> 01:36:48,020
When you close your eyes...

2635
01:36:48,020 --> 01:36:52,320
Does it always feel like nothing has changed?

2636
01:36:54,060 --> 01:36:55,200
Oh my god.

2637
01:36:55,460 --> 01:36:57,400
That's actually a lot closer.

2638
01:36:58,040 --> 01:37:00,280
A lot closer than I expected.

2639
01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:02,400
I know that you guys would be like...

2640
01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:07,320
But Doki, didn't you say you don't wanna have goon as the last part?

2641
01:37:07,760 --> 01:37:08,500
Because of...

2642
01:37:08,500 --> 01:37:11,120
Because of what they did to goons?

2643
01:37:12,860 --> 01:37:15,800
Dragoons would be like my only exception, to be fair.

2644
01:37:16,300 --> 01:37:20,460
Like, I don't think I could ever adopt a new name with goon in it.

2645
01:37:20,540 --> 01:37:20,940
But...

2646
01:37:20,940 --> 01:37:24,680
I just have a particular attachment to dragoons.

2647
01:37:24,760 --> 01:37:26,760
That it would be my only exception...

2648
01:37:26,760 --> 01:37:28,320
If it wins the poll.

2649
01:37:29,820 --> 01:37:31,240
If we win...

2650
01:37:31,240 --> 01:37:33,460
If it wins...

2651
01:37:33,460 --> 01:37:35,420
The rule says you cannot vote...

2652
01:37:35,420 --> 01:37:37,300
Because then it would be confusing!

2653
01:37:38,120 --> 01:37:39,320
That's the rule!

2654
01:37:40,180 --> 01:37:42,740
It would be way too confusing.

2655
01:37:43,080 --> 01:37:45,300
If there's two names.

2656
01:37:46,540 --> 01:37:48,720
I guess like for suspects...

2657
01:37:48,720 --> 01:37:49,640
Because I still want...

2658
01:37:49,640 --> 01:37:51,280
Four different forms.

2659
01:37:51,380 --> 01:37:52,040
So like...

2660
01:37:52,040 --> 01:37:53,040
Chonky Peck.

2661
01:37:54,080 --> 01:37:54,940
Chonky Sus.

2662
01:37:55,340 --> 01:37:56,160
Oh my god.

2663
01:37:56,220 --> 01:37:57,100
How would it be...

2664
01:37:57,100 --> 01:37:57,900
How do we say it?

2665
01:37:58,020 --> 01:37:59,420
Would it be Chonky Sus?

2666
01:38:00,410 --> 01:38:02,200
Or Chonky Specks?

2667
01:38:02,920 --> 01:38:04,100
Chonky Pecks?

2668
01:38:04,640 --> 01:38:06,120
Chonky Sus Specks?

2669
01:38:06,200 --> 01:38:07,120
Chonky Speck?

2670
01:38:07,120 --> 01:38:07,980
Chonky Specks?

2671
01:38:08,430 --> 01:38:09,400
Long Specks?

2672
01:38:10,350 --> 01:38:11,200
Long Sus?

2673
01:38:13,460 --> 01:38:14,160
Uhh...

2674
01:38:16,220 --> 01:38:17,460
Egg Specks?

2675
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:27,200
It was this one design that...

2676
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:28,680
Like some people were submitting designs.

2677
01:38:29,080 --> 01:38:34,360
And there was one design that I would really like that gave me some ideas.

2678
01:38:34,580 --> 01:38:36,880
And like why I was like thinking maybe we...

2679
01:38:36,880 --> 01:38:38,560
If Dragoons wins.

2680
01:38:39,480 --> 01:38:40,040
Um...

2681
01:38:40,040 --> 01:38:44,220
There's like this idea on how to like this idea.

2682
01:38:44,220 --> 01:38:45,020
Wanted to do.

2683
01:38:47,680 --> 01:38:48,460
Uh...аки Susqu.

2684
01:38:48,760 --> 01:38:49,800
Oh god...

2685
01:38:49,800 --> 01:38:50,540
You two both almost gave up my idea.

2686
01:38:50,540 --> 01:38:50,620
They don't JUST ASrese程 Waiting here.

2687
01:38:50,660 --> 01:38:50,980
Yes Rick thing

2688
01:38:56,260 --> 01:39:01,640
I'm trying to sing like, chonky peck, chonky sus, long peck.

2689
01:39:04,760 --> 01:39:08,060
Sorry, long peck sounds so fucking weird.

2690
01:39:09,680 --> 01:39:12,720
Because then I can think about it as like pecks, you know?

2691
01:39:12,920 --> 01:39:13,920
And then...

2692
01:39:13,920 --> 01:39:18,960
Then long peck, egg peck.

2693
01:39:20,180 --> 01:39:21,300
That's a word.

2694
01:39:22,280 --> 01:39:26,380
Is it like, people are now voting more for dragoons?

2695
01:39:26,420 --> 01:39:29,740
Because like, no, actually, I don't think I want to be called that.

2696
01:39:30,080 --> 01:39:30,760
I don't like it.

2697
01:39:34,540 --> 01:39:38,700
Sus goons, please, I want to be a dragoonier.

2698
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:42,960
Where is... there's no free bird!

2699
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:46,900
They lost their voting power after the first stream.

2700
01:39:49,420 --> 01:39:52,100
Doki bros, because every time we see...

2701
01:39:53,720 --> 01:39:54,280
Alright.

2702
01:39:58,190 --> 01:40:00,450
Oh my god, okay, so like...

2703
01:40:00,450 --> 01:40:02,470
I forgot to tell you guys this story.

2704
01:40:02,970 --> 01:40:05,750
But like, when I was playing...

2705
01:40:07,090 --> 01:40:11,310
Apex, so like, obviously I've been playing Apex a lot during that one month.

2706
01:40:11,570 --> 01:40:13,630
But like, one of them was...

2707
01:40:13,630 --> 01:40:14,210
Hahaha!

2708
01:40:16,650 --> 01:40:17,570
I'm so...

2709
01:40:18,230 --> 01:40:18,750
So...

2710
01:40:20,250 --> 01:40:20,770
Okay.

2711
01:40:21,790 --> 01:40:23,010
Oh, wait, never mind.

2712
01:40:23,130 --> 01:40:24,150
I can't say it.

2713
01:40:24,290 --> 01:40:26,290
I can't say it.

2714
01:40:26,750 --> 01:40:28,870
God, sorry, I'm gonna like...

2715
01:40:28,870 --> 01:40:30,590
You're just gonna be like...

2716
01:40:30,590 --> 01:40:32,770
You're gonna get blue balled for the rest of the stream.

2717
01:40:32,890 --> 01:40:34,210
Because I'll never say what it was.

2718
01:40:34,470 --> 01:40:34,990
Sorry.

2719
01:40:35,070 --> 01:40:35,470
Hahaha!

2720
01:40:39,130 --> 01:40:41,370
I guess you'll never know the story.

2721
01:40:41,770 --> 01:40:42,890
You'll never know.

2722
01:40:42,910 --> 01:40:44,130
Something funny happened.

2723
01:40:44,350 --> 01:40:45,370
But you'll never know.

2724
01:40:45,370 --> 01:40:46,310
You'll never know the story.

2725
01:40:47,100 --> 01:40:48,110
Very unfortunate.

2726
01:40:49,040 --> 01:40:50,490
Very unfortunate.

2727
01:40:51,310 --> 01:40:52,030
Alright.

2728
01:40:52,250 --> 01:40:54,470
I'm gonna give you guys one more minute.

2729
01:40:54,910 --> 01:40:59,410
Suspects, rise up if you wanna defeat the old.

2730
01:40:59,670 --> 01:41:01,930
And bring in a new generation.

2731
01:41:02,610 --> 01:41:03,750
It's like a dynasty.

2732
01:41:05,040 --> 01:41:06,070
You wanna overthrow.

2733
01:41:06,710 --> 01:41:08,110
Overthrow the old.

2734
01:41:08,270 --> 01:41:10,170
And bring in your new dynasty.

2735
01:41:11,210 --> 01:41:11,950
Suspects.

2736
01:41:11,950 --> 01:41:14,090
Are you strong enough, suspects?

2737
01:41:15,350 --> 01:41:18,110
To kick those boomers out?

2738
01:41:18,350 --> 01:41:18,870
Hahaha!

2739
01:41:21,650 --> 01:41:24,270
Suspects installed the bots.

2740
01:41:24,830 --> 01:41:27,550
New name for the new year.

2741
01:41:28,190 --> 01:41:31,470
Suspects rallied the undecided voters.

2742
01:41:31,790 --> 01:41:33,150
This is it.

2743
01:41:33,870 --> 01:41:36,410
Rally the undecided voters.

2744
01:41:37,130 --> 01:41:37,930
Hahaha!

2745
01:41:40,450 --> 01:41:42,550
If you want to win.

2746
01:41:42,750 --> 01:41:44,070
You have to rally the undecided voters.

2747
01:41:44,090 --> 01:41:44,910
Rally up!

2748
01:41:45,170 --> 01:41:48,870
And kick those old boomers out of office!

2749
01:41:49,450 --> 01:41:53,450
They would have... they would have lost in Nesticle.

2750
01:41:54,250 --> 01:42:02,990
You know, honestly like 100% if Nesticles was in there, I would 100% agree that...

2751
01:42:02,990 --> 01:42:06,450
that they would have won over Dragoons.

2752
01:42:06,690 --> 01:42:08,390
Come on, suspects!

2753
01:42:08,970 --> 01:42:09,850
You're young!

2754
01:42:10,250 --> 01:42:11,670
There's more of you!

2755
01:42:11,670 --> 01:42:19,870
You really got to let a bunch of old Dragoons out there take away what you believe in?

2756
01:42:21,850 --> 01:42:22,610
Come on!

2757
01:42:25,010 --> 01:42:26,790
How long are you gonna make us dance?

2758
01:42:27,030 --> 01:42:29,650
I just want to see if I can get 50-50 right now.

2759
01:42:34,590 --> 01:42:36,190
Come on, Dragoons!

2760
01:42:36,250 --> 01:42:37,290
Hold the line!

2761
01:42:37,930 --> 01:42:41,370
Don't let those youngins take our office!

2762
01:42:42,670 --> 01:42:44,730
Dragoons will be in office forever!

2763
01:42:48,410 --> 01:42:49,050
Suspects!

2764
01:42:49,250 --> 01:42:51,350
Rally up the other ones!

2765
01:42:51,530 --> 01:42:54,350
Rally the Nesticles to vote for you!

2766
01:42:54,650 --> 01:42:55,790
Oh my god, wait a minute.

2767
01:42:55,810 --> 01:42:57,010
Suspects are actually winning.

2768
01:42:57,150 --> 01:42:57,650
Holy fuck.

2769
01:42:57,890 --> 01:42:59,750
I didn't expect that to happen.

2770
01:43:02,910 --> 01:43:05,270
Guys, come on!

2771
01:43:05,670 --> 01:43:08,250
It's new year, new us!

2772
01:43:08,610 --> 01:43:10,950
If Doki can change their names...

2773
01:43:11,670 --> 01:43:12,650
We can too!

2774
01:43:15,730 --> 01:43:17,550
Doki... Dragoons... Really?

2775
01:43:17,830 --> 01:43:23,910
You're gonna let a bunch of like... young... young birds tell you what to do?

2776
01:43:24,330 --> 01:43:25,390
Come on!

2777
01:43:25,930 --> 01:43:27,690
You're a military unit!

2778
01:43:27,910 --> 01:43:31,110
You're really gonna let birds tell you what to do?

2779
01:43:31,570 --> 01:43:32,490
They're like, Connie!

2780
01:43:32,970 --> 01:43:34,730
We fucking eat birds!

2781
01:43:35,310 --> 01:43:35,550
Like...

2782
01:43:35,550 --> 01:43:35,950
Like...

2783
01:43:39,870 --> 01:43:42,930
New era suspects, come on!

2784
01:43:43,590 --> 01:43:46,350
Dragoons, today we reclaim our legacy!

2785
01:43:48,990 --> 01:43:52,550
If it's 50-50, we should pick Nesticles.

2786
01:43:52,850 --> 01:43:57,810
Alright, Nesticles is like the third party that has like only one person in office.

2787
01:43:58,130 --> 01:44:00,510
And even then, they can't really do much.

2788
01:44:01,590 --> 01:44:04,950
It's like... it's like 50... it's like...

2789
01:44:04,950 --> 01:44:08,910
Suspects versus Dragoons have like majority of the seats.

2790
01:44:09,110 --> 01:44:11,530
And then, Nesticles is that one guy.

2791
01:44:11,730 --> 01:44:15,990
Like the one... the one person in there that has power there.

2792
01:44:18,590 --> 01:44:21,730
Where their votes don't really count, but they're there!

2793
01:44:21,990 --> 01:44:23,650
They're in the office!

2794
01:44:26,590 --> 01:44:28,090
Push the 50-50.

2795
01:44:28,330 --> 01:44:29,190
Alright, Suspects.

2796
01:44:29,190 --> 01:44:31,150
I feel like I gave you guys...

2797
01:44:31,150 --> 01:44:34,930
Like... so much time to like... fight for what you put in.

2798
01:44:34,930 --> 01:44:35,430
And what you believe in.

2799
01:44:35,570 --> 01:44:36,650
But like...

2800
01:44:36,650 --> 01:44:40,970
Just like the real world, Boomers are always in charge.

2801
01:44:41,550 --> 01:44:41,970
So...

2802
01:44:46,310 --> 01:44:46,950
Suspects.

2803
01:44:46,950 --> 01:44:51,210
I feel like this is a harsh lesson of reality.

2804
01:44:51,470 --> 01:44:54,030
Of what the real world is like.

2805
01:44:54,210 --> 01:44:57,750
Where even though you have a cool new idea.

2806
01:44:58,070 --> 01:45:02,230
No matter what, in the end, the Boomers always win.

2807
01:45:02,390 --> 01:45:03,970
Because they refuse to die.

2808
01:45:07,610 --> 01:45:09,790
They'll be 90 years old.

2809
01:45:09,930 --> 01:45:11,470
And still in office.

2810
01:45:11,650 --> 01:45:15,510
And you can't do a damn thing about it.

2811
01:45:17,690 --> 01:45:19,030
So like...

2812
01:45:19,030 --> 01:45:20,310
As a young one.

2813
01:45:20,410 --> 01:45:22,870
As a little baby Suspects.

2814
01:45:24,030 --> 01:45:26,230
As a little baby Suspects.

2815
01:45:26,350 --> 01:45:28,810
Watching an anime girl...

2816
01:45:28,810 --> 01:45:30,990
Show you the harsh reality.

2817
01:45:31,230 --> 01:45:33,250
And give you a simulation...

2818
01:45:33,250 --> 01:45:35,890
Of what that was like in the real world.

2819
01:45:36,390 --> 01:45:36,550
But now...

2820
01:45:37,330 --> 01:45:39,270
I reject change.

2821
01:45:40,090 --> 01:45:42,550
Thank you for the magenta soupa, Alan.

2822
01:45:42,690 --> 01:45:43,710
Thank you, thank you.

2823
01:45:44,110 --> 01:45:44,910
Like I say.

2824
01:45:45,210 --> 01:45:46,890
Alan is one of those...

2825
01:45:47,090 --> 01:45:48,190
Old goons.

2826
01:45:48,610 --> 01:45:56,250
He- He- He- He- You have to overthrow goons like that.

2827
01:45:56,430 --> 01:45:57,910
To get what you want.

2828
01:45:59,570 --> 01:46:03,130
Can we be suspects on April Fools?

2829
01:46:06,510 --> 01:46:09,270
Anyway... I'm sorry Suspex.

2830
01:46:09,410 --> 01:46:14,470
I gave you enough time to try and overthrow the old power.

2831
01:46:14,930 --> 01:46:26,490
But it seems like... it seems like the dragoons have evolved and kept... they're birds now.

2832
01:46:32,110 --> 01:46:37,870
There was a ten minute... I gave you guys ten minutes to fight for what you believe in.

2833
01:46:38,010 --> 01:46:47,610
And if you can't fucking fight for what you believe in within ten minutes of me giving you extra time to rally for it...

2834
01:46:47,610 --> 01:46:49,130
That's not on me.

2835
01:46:53,290 --> 01:46:55,670
That's just reality at that point.

2836
01:46:56,490 --> 01:47:03,030
Because in the real world, you have like almost a whole year to figure this shit out.

2837
01:47:03,370 --> 01:47:10,270
Not even a year, but you have multiple years to try and not let the old people win.

2838
01:47:10,590 --> 01:47:17,030
But in the end, not even just in like... in like... I guess like policies wise...

2839
01:47:17,030 --> 01:47:19,450
It's also like business wise too.

2840
01:47:20,590 --> 01:47:25,950
That's why you need to overthrow any CEO that's eight years old.

2841
01:47:31,370 --> 01:47:32,970
I'm talking about you.

2842
01:47:34,210 --> 01:47:35,910
CEO's name I don't remember.

2843
01:47:36,210 --> 01:47:41,970
Who's literally like fucking deleting movies for tax reasons.

2844
01:47:42,510 --> 01:47:43,930
Like what the fuck?

2845
01:47:44,490 --> 01:47:47,170
Okay, I know I talked about it yesterday.

2846
01:47:47,270 --> 01:47:48,890
But I have to talk about this again.

2847
01:47:49,170 --> 01:47:53,910
Like this guy, the CEO of like Warner Brothers.

2848
01:47:53,910 --> 01:47:56,050
Fucking deleted Wile E.

2849
01:47:56,090 --> 01:47:57,690
Coyote for a tax break.

2850
01:47:57,950 --> 01:48:00,790
And like other studios offered money.

2851
01:48:01,010 --> 01:48:03,810
And he's like, no, not enough.

2852
01:48:04,510 --> 01:48:06,330
Like what the fuck?

2853
01:48:07,390 --> 01:48:13,850
Like other studios are like, hey, I'm willing to buy your movie.

2854
01:48:14,170 --> 01:48:15,430
And they're like, no.

2855
01:48:15,730 --> 01:48:18,750
But it's basically like Coyote versus Acme.

2856
01:48:18,890 --> 01:48:20,310
And it's like this like mockumentary...

2857
01:48:20,310 --> 01:48:22,130
I think it's like a mockumentary style thing.

2858
01:48:22,130 --> 01:48:25,310
About Wile E.

2859
01:48:25,370 --> 01:48:29,830
Coyote trying to like in a court case against Acme Inc.

2860
01:48:30,070 --> 01:48:34,850
And like apparently the test screenings was actually really nice.

2861
01:48:35,030 --> 01:48:36,830
Really did really well received.

2862
01:48:38,070 --> 01:48:44,830
But like Warner Brothers CEO was like, we need more tax breaks because we're losing money.

2863
01:48:45,050 --> 01:48:46,850
And I'm just like...

2864
01:48:48,850 --> 01:48:49,190
What?

2865
01:48:56,370 --> 01:49:00,230
Yeah, those poor actors and those poor...

2866
01:49:00,230 --> 01:49:04,190
Those poor actors and like the production company.

2867
01:49:04,290 --> 01:49:07,990
They leaked the production company video of...

2868
01:49:09,950 --> 01:49:11,990
The production company video.

2869
01:49:12,090 --> 01:49:14,250
They like leaked the...

2870
01:49:14,770 --> 01:49:16,390
I guess like the cast party.

2871
01:49:16,590 --> 01:49:18,570
Like the behind the scenes of everything.

2872
01:49:18,990 --> 01:49:21,790
So you could even see like all the set designs.

2873
01:49:22,130 --> 01:49:23,390
And everything that was built.

2874
01:49:25,670 --> 01:49:27,690
All the stuff that was built for it.

2875
01:49:27,770 --> 01:49:29,950
And it looks like so much time and effort was built.

2876
01:49:30,010 --> 01:49:30,330
Anyway.

2877
01:49:31,050 --> 01:49:31,490
Anyway.

2878
01:49:32,050 --> 01:49:33,910
Sorry, I need to get that out of my chest.

2879
01:49:34,010 --> 01:49:36,050
Because I still can't believe they fucking shelved that movie.

2880
01:49:36,450 --> 01:49:36,890
Anyway.

2881
01:49:37,950 --> 01:49:39,230
Happy Lunar New Year.

2882
01:49:40,290 --> 01:49:40,730
Congratulations.

2883
01:49:41,350 --> 01:49:42,410
You've been named.

2884
01:49:42,950 --> 01:49:45,330
It's sad that suspects couldn't win the poll.

2885
01:49:49,550 --> 01:49:50,770
Put another poll.

2886
01:49:50,770 --> 01:49:52,310
Hooters versus...

2887
01:49:52,310 --> 01:49:53,290
I like how someone was like...

2888
01:49:53,290 --> 01:49:55,690
Hooters versus dragoons.

2889
01:49:55,830 --> 01:49:57,310
We will win.

2890
01:49:57,870 --> 01:49:59,110
We will win.

2891
01:50:00,110 --> 01:50:01,430
Nesticles poll.

2892
01:50:02,130 --> 01:50:02,850
No.

2893
01:50:03,010 --> 01:50:04,650
Alright, I'll humor you guys.

2894
01:50:04,890 --> 01:50:06,090
I'll humor you guys.

2895
01:50:06,450 --> 01:50:08,090
I'll humor you guys.

2896
01:50:08,290 --> 01:50:08,530
Alright?

2897
01:50:09,950 --> 01:50:10,710
Alright.

2898
01:50:11,090 --> 01:50:13,730
Just for those who are like...

2899
01:50:13,730 --> 01:50:15,150
No, you don't understand.

2900
01:50:15,950 --> 01:50:17,430
Nesticles can...

2901
01:50:17,430 --> 01:50:20,090
Nesticles will beat dragoons.

2902
01:50:20,770 --> 01:50:20,970
We got you!

2903
01:50:25,830 --> 01:50:26,570
Alright.

2904
01:50:26,850 --> 01:50:27,470
Anyway.

2905
01:50:28,710 --> 01:50:32,090
It's time to give you guys a form.

2906
01:50:32,350 --> 01:50:35,750
So, there was this one artist from Thin.

2907
01:50:35,810 --> 01:50:36,730
Like, her name is...

2908
01:50:37,490 --> 01:50:39,590
Their name is...

2909
01:50:40,890 --> 01:50:41,630
...thinen.

2910
01:50:41,630 --> 01:50:44,010
And Thin...

2911
01:50:44,010 --> 01:50:45,510
They've like...

2912
01:50:45,510 --> 01:50:47,430
They've done this concept.

2913
01:50:49,890 --> 01:50:51,550
Okay, fuck you guys.

2914
01:50:51,670 --> 01:50:52,590
We're not gonna be...

2915
01:50:57,730 --> 01:51:05,750
So like, they did this concept design for you guys.

2916
01:51:05,910 --> 01:51:12,830
And that's what got me an idea of maybe perhaps we stay with dragoons.

2917
01:51:12,970 --> 01:51:14,730
Also, Joe, thank you for the 50 conditions!

2918
01:51:15,030 --> 01:51:15,350
Thank you!

2919
01:51:17,730 --> 01:51:19,290
Oh shit, what the fuck?

2920
01:51:19,470 --> 01:51:19,650
Okay.

2921
01:51:21,230 --> 01:51:23,110
There was like something that came on my screen.

2922
01:51:23,390 --> 01:51:27,130
And I thought it was showing up on stream as well, like my drawing program.

2923
01:51:27,510 --> 01:51:34,270
But then I was like, oh no, that's just like on the... that was just covering up my YouTube previews.

2924
01:51:34,270 --> 01:51:35,890
So it looks like it was on screen.

2925
01:51:38,930 --> 01:51:41,270
So let me show you guys this picture.

2926
01:51:41,470 --> 01:51:44,630
So I really liked this concept.

2927
01:51:44,970 --> 01:51:47,090
But obviously I'm gonna tweak it a little bit.

2928
01:51:47,430 --> 01:51:49,030
To make it work more.

2929
01:51:49,190 --> 01:51:50,730
But I'll show you guys here, yeah.

2930
01:51:52,410 --> 01:51:53,450
Alright, so...

2931
01:51:53,450 --> 01:51:54,730
Now we're here.

2932
01:51:54,850 --> 01:51:56,830
I love how it says like sub gold top donation.

2933
01:51:57,150 --> 01:52:00,230
I... Sorry, that was like Twitch meta.

2934
01:52:00,650 --> 01:52:05,530
And all my overlays I'm using are like old Twitch stuff.

2935
01:52:06,010 --> 01:52:10,910
So that's why it's like... what the fuck?

2936
01:52:10,910 --> 01:52:12,690
Why is there that stuff?

2937
01:52:13,510 --> 01:52:15,210
So, wait, let me show you guys.

2938
01:52:15,210 --> 01:52:17,690
So this is the reason why I thought about it.

2939
01:52:17,710 --> 01:52:22,090
Thought about... cause I really... I liked how... oops, sorry.

2940
01:52:22,270 --> 01:52:24,450
I liked how it was like...

2941
01:52:25,750 --> 01:52:29,950
It felt like the dragoon was evolving.

2942
01:52:30,370 --> 01:52:31,150
You know?

2943
01:52:32,050 --> 01:52:36,730
This... it looked like an evolution of a dragoon.

2944
01:52:36,750 --> 01:52:38,890
We're not gonna be called nesticas!

2945
01:52:39,090 --> 01:52:40,950
I was humoring you!

2946
01:52:47,450 --> 01:52:50,910
So, I... it's gonna... I wanna take like certain...

2947
01:52:50,910 --> 01:52:52,570
We're not gonna have cheek dots too.

2948
01:52:52,770 --> 01:52:55,550
We're not... we're not gonna have cheek dots!

2949
01:52:56,110 --> 01:52:58,870
I told you, we're not devolving!

2950
01:52:59,610 --> 01:53:01,910
We're evolving, okay?

2951
01:53:02,770 --> 01:53:03,990
We are...

2952
01:53:04,970 --> 01:53:07,970
We are evolving, okay guys?

2953
01:53:15,530 --> 01:53:19,390
So... so that's why I really enjoyed this concept.

2954
01:53:19,570 --> 01:53:20,730
And that's what got me thinking.

2955
01:53:20,890 --> 01:53:24,810
Because obviously, uh, dinosaurs evolved into birds.

2956
01:53:25,090 --> 01:53:31,390
So I liked how like, it's like a semi-evolution of... of like a dinosaur.

2957
01:53:31,850 --> 01:53:34,510
And I thought that was a really neat concept.

2958
01:53:34,610 --> 01:53:37,930
And then the fact that it has like... you know...

2959
01:53:37,930 --> 01:53:39,410
I guess like, what do you say?

2960
01:53:39,570 --> 01:53:41,730
The long... long goon?

2961
01:53:41,830 --> 01:53:43,030
The chonky goon?

2962
01:53:43,150 --> 01:53:44,930
And then I don't know which one's the chonky goon.

2963
01:53:44,930 --> 01:53:45,650
Not to be fair.

2964
01:53:45,750 --> 01:53:46,370
I don't...

2965
01:53:46,370 --> 01:53:49,950
I hate my little nest... nesticles.

2966
01:53:50,610 --> 01:53:51,870
Doki, you don't understand!

2967
01:53:52,110 --> 01:53:53,330
It rolls off your tongue!

2968
01:53:53,610 --> 01:53:54,870
I hate my little nesticles!

2969
01:53:54,970 --> 01:53:57,090
We're not going to be nesticles!

2970
01:53:59,670 --> 01:54:03,070
Thank you for the akasupa, Pancho.

2971
01:54:03,070 --> 01:54:04,230
Thank you, thank you.

2972
01:54:04,510 --> 01:54:06,490
I love democracy.

2973
01:54:10,550 --> 01:54:11,070
Alright.

2974
01:54:12,630 --> 01:54:14,270
Alright, so that's what I was thinking.

2975
01:54:14,390 --> 01:54:14,830
So like...

2976
01:54:14,930 --> 01:54:16,230
I was thinking of like...

2977
01:54:16,230 --> 01:54:18,930
I'm trying to like think of like the default base design.

2978
01:54:19,250 --> 01:54:20,790
Because I do think like...

2979
01:54:20,790 --> 01:54:21,550
That's...

2980
01:54:22,050 --> 01:54:22,930
Really cute.

2981
01:54:23,010 --> 01:54:24,130
Like the...

2982
01:54:24,130 --> 01:54:25,050
Uh...

2983
01:54:25,050 --> 01:54:27,490
I like how there was somebody that was like...

2984
01:54:27,490 --> 01:54:29,210
And I like how this is like...

2985
01:54:29,210 --> 01:54:30,790
You know how it was like this?

2986
01:54:31,730 --> 01:54:32,210
The...

2987
01:54:32,210 --> 01:54:33,750
But then it went up?

2988
01:54:33,850 --> 01:54:36,870
Because I don't know your fucking head evolved...

2989
01:54:37,350 --> 01:54:38,670
Fucking weirdly, I guess.

2990
01:54:42,520 --> 01:54:43,360
So like...

2991
01:54:43,360 --> 01:54:44,900
Instead of the side...

2992
01:54:44,900 --> 01:54:46,080
It went up.

2993
01:54:46,260 --> 01:54:47,580
So it stood...

2994
01:54:47,580 --> 01:54:48,820
Fucking went up.

2995
01:54:50,740 --> 01:54:51,220
Um...

2996
01:54:51,880 --> 01:54:52,360
Um...

2997
01:54:52,360 --> 01:54:52,660
What?

2998
01:54:52,740 --> 01:54:53,760
Thank you for the akasupa!

2999
01:54:53,960 --> 01:54:54,920
Thank you, thank you!

3000
01:54:56,660 --> 01:54:57,380
Satisfying this.

3001
01:54:57,920 --> 01:54:58,720
What did you say?

3002
01:54:58,920 --> 01:55:01,780
I supan my first ever supa to you a while back.

3003
01:55:02,020 --> 01:55:04,160
This is my first akasupa ever!

3004
01:55:04,520 --> 01:55:07,740
What a perfect day to give you a red rectangle with my...

3005
01:55:07,740 --> 01:55:09,580
Thank you, thank you for the akasupa!

3006
01:55:09,680 --> 01:55:11,040
Thank you, thank you!

3007
01:55:12,380 --> 01:55:12,860
I...

3008
01:55:12,860 --> 01:55:14,240
This was not enough, guys.

3009
01:55:14,380 --> 01:55:14,880
It was not enough.

3010
01:55:14,880 --> 01:55:15,280
This was not official.

3011
01:55:15,640 --> 01:55:18,460
I said I will humor you guys.

3012
01:55:21,880 --> 01:55:27,920
I did say it was out of humor.

3013
01:55:28,200 --> 01:55:31,760
And I like how, you know, there's like still horns and stuff too.

3014
01:55:32,100 --> 01:55:33,540
But I don't know if like...

3015
01:55:33,540 --> 01:55:36,440
I'm trying to figure out like...

3016
01:55:36,440 --> 01:55:38,040
The proportion wise.

3017
01:55:38,360 --> 01:55:40,220
We're like a normal goon.

3018
01:55:40,280 --> 01:55:41,480
So I don't know if I should like...

3019
01:55:41,480 --> 01:55:42,400
You guys should have a body.

3020
01:55:42,560 --> 01:55:44,200
Or you guys just be all head.

3021
01:55:44,200 --> 01:55:46,540
Like I can't tell.

3022
01:55:47,960 --> 01:55:52,800
I can't tell if I want you guys to be all head.

3023
01:55:53,540 --> 01:55:54,180
Or...

3024
01:55:54,180 --> 01:55:55,760
Or like...

3025
01:55:55,760 --> 01:55:57,280
Or like have a body.

3026
01:55:57,400 --> 01:55:59,540
Because then what would the chonky goon look like?

3027
01:55:59,760 --> 01:56:02,640
What would the chonky goon look like if it's like...

3028
01:56:02,640 --> 01:56:04,020
If you guys...

3029
01:56:04,020 --> 01:56:04,680
If it's...

3030
01:56:04,680 --> 01:56:05,540
If it's all head.

3031
01:56:06,380 --> 01:56:07,460
Or the...

3032
01:56:10,100 --> 01:56:12,160
One year Neste goes...

3033
01:56:12,160 --> 01:56:12,360
No!

3034
01:56:12,440 --> 01:56:13,100
Because then...

3035
01:56:14,200 --> 01:56:19,380
It would be confusing if I changed the fan name a year after all head.

3036
01:56:19,640 --> 01:56:20,580
No way.

3037
01:56:23,010 --> 01:56:24,960
So you want to make it look like...

3038
01:56:24,960 --> 01:56:26,920
The thing is I was like wondering...

3039
01:56:26,920 --> 01:56:29,540
How to like distinguish you guys too.

3040
01:56:29,800 --> 01:56:30,520
You know?

3041
01:56:30,700 --> 01:56:32,220
So like there's the tail.

3042
01:56:37,410 --> 01:56:39,390
Like that and then...

3043
01:56:39,390 --> 01:56:40,630
And then...

3044
01:56:42,930 --> 01:56:43,630
There.

3045
01:56:43,750 --> 01:56:44,890
It's just...

3046
01:56:48,550 --> 01:56:50,470
You guys look like a fucking tomato.

3047
01:56:52,650 --> 01:56:57,670
Oh my god.

3048
01:56:57,710 --> 01:56:59,090
I don't know if you guys should have wings.

3049
01:56:59,310 --> 01:57:00,170
I don't know...

3050
01:57:00,170 --> 01:57:02,430
I don't know if you guys should have wings or not.

3051
01:57:03,550 --> 01:57:05,610
Looking pretty nesticle here.

3052
01:57:06,250 --> 01:57:07,370
I don't know guys.

3053
01:57:07,610 --> 01:57:09,030
I don't know if you guys deserve wings.

3054
01:57:10,510 --> 01:57:11,470
You guys haven't...

3055
01:57:11,470 --> 01:57:14,090
I feel like you guys just haven't evolved into wings yet.

3056
01:57:14,230 --> 01:57:14,590
Like...

3057
01:57:20,250 --> 01:57:22,510
I want to edit this a little bit though.

3058
01:57:23,750 --> 01:57:27,450
Okay, so if it has wings, you guys would look like...

3059
01:57:28,970 --> 01:57:30,730
You guys would look like...

3060
01:57:32,050 --> 01:57:33,970
Like basically like a raptor.

3061
01:57:34,110 --> 01:57:36,450
Like the original concept was like that.

3062
01:57:36,690 --> 01:57:40,430
But I feel like it would be cuter if you just have like...

3063
01:57:42,270 --> 01:57:45,970
Like if it's just a potato arms.

3064
01:57:50,150 --> 01:57:52,590
It'll look very stupid.

3065
01:57:52,810 --> 01:57:55,110
We need small wings.

3066
01:57:55,310 --> 01:57:56,550
So you want to look like this?

3067
01:57:59,530 --> 01:58:03,510
I don't think I want like the bows and stuff though.

3068
01:58:03,670 --> 01:58:05,130
I was like thinking like...

3069
01:58:06,250 --> 01:58:09,530
You'll still keep number...

3070
01:58:09,530 --> 01:58:09,750
I...

3071
01:58:09,750 --> 01:58:13,670
I've always liked that concept but I don't think we can do that.

3072
01:58:13,790 --> 01:58:15,050
You know what I mean?

3073
01:58:16,790 --> 01:58:18,190
Let us fly.

3074
01:58:18,490 --> 01:58:20,310
Okay, we'll let you fly.

3075
01:58:22,450 --> 01:58:23,490
And then...

3076
01:58:32,160 --> 01:58:33,900
Alright, so it'll be like...

3077
01:58:33,900 --> 01:58:35,020
Boom, boom, boom.

3078
01:58:36,200 --> 01:58:37,540
I feel like...

3079
01:58:37,540 --> 01:58:38,240
I don't know.

3080
01:58:38,320 --> 01:58:40,060
I'm just like thinking like...

3081
01:58:40,060 --> 01:58:41,020
Uh...

3082
01:58:42,200 --> 01:58:45,260
Like what is a way to...

3083
01:58:45,800 --> 01:58:47,600
What is like a way to...

3084
01:58:47,840 --> 01:58:49,400
differentiate all of you?

3085
01:58:50,140 --> 01:58:52,280
We obviously can't put a number anymore.

3086
01:58:57,360 --> 01:58:58,880
Arms and wings?

3087
01:58:59,600 --> 01:59:01,260
Guys, now you're demanding.

3088
01:59:04,080 --> 01:59:05,800
We should be flightless?

3089
01:59:06,080 --> 01:59:07,120
Okay, alright.

3090
01:59:07,260 --> 01:59:08,080
We're gonna have a poll.

3091
01:59:08,580 --> 01:59:10,900
No either wings or no wings.

3092
01:59:11,240 --> 01:59:11,840
Either...

3093
01:59:14,120 --> 01:59:17,220
Either you guys have no wings and you're like this.

3094
01:59:17,240 --> 01:59:17,820
Either you guys have no wings and you're like this.

3095
01:59:19,500 --> 01:59:19,940
Or...

3096
01:59:19,940 --> 01:59:20,620
Oh my god.

3097
01:59:22,840 --> 01:59:24,780
Wings or no wings?

3098
01:59:29,760 --> 01:59:31,880
Wings, arms or no arms?

3099
01:59:32,020 --> 01:59:33,280
The arms would be like that.

3100
01:59:33,380 --> 01:59:34,400
But then wings...

3101
01:59:34,400 --> 01:59:35,800
I feel like arms would be better.

3102
01:59:36,440 --> 01:59:37,760
Arms would be so funny.

3103
01:59:43,280 --> 01:59:45,500
I like how somebody was like...

3104
01:59:45,500 --> 01:59:47,160
I don't know who it was but like...

3105
01:59:47,160 --> 01:59:48,520
Please, I don't wanna be a bird.

3106
01:59:49,940 --> 01:59:51,280
So this is like the next...

3107
01:59:51,280 --> 01:59:51,860
Next best thing!

3108
01:59:54,070 --> 01:59:55,460
We're not gonna have cheek dots.

3109
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,560
I know you guys really want...

3110
01:59:58,560 --> 01:59:59,240
I mean...

3111
01:59:59,240 --> 02:00:01,660
It does look really cute though.

3112
02:00:02,300 --> 02:00:04,680
It does look really cute though.

3113
02:00:05,060 --> 02:00:05,680
The...

3114
02:00:06,190 --> 02:00:06,500
The...

3115
02:00:07,210 --> 02:00:08,460
Boneless or boneless?

3116
02:00:13,010 --> 02:00:14,540
Okay, wait.

3117
02:00:14,580 --> 02:00:15,100
Give me a sec.

3118
02:00:15,280 --> 02:00:17,660
Let me check this out real fast.

3119
02:00:18,540 --> 02:00:20,240
Let me see what it looks like.

3120
02:00:25,170 --> 02:00:28,270
Let me see what it looks like without cheek dots.

3121
02:00:29,790 --> 02:00:30,610
Let's see.

3122
02:00:33,170 --> 02:00:33,870
I don't know.

3123
02:00:34,910 --> 02:00:36,610
I'm trying to think right now.

3124
02:00:37,610 --> 02:00:38,930
I'm trying to think.

3125
02:00:39,110 --> 02:00:40,770
I feel like...

3126
02:00:41,310 --> 02:00:42,930
I feel like...

3127
02:00:43,770 --> 02:00:47,030
Give us those we deserve.

3128
02:00:53,350 --> 02:00:54,450
I'm trying to think.

3129
02:00:54,450 --> 02:00:57,630
I'm trying to think if you guys deserve to have cheek dots or not.

3130
02:00:58,110 --> 02:00:59,950
Bone in or bone out.

3131
02:01:00,030 --> 02:01:00,850
No cheek dots.

3132
02:01:00,950 --> 02:01:03,110
Dot cheeks will rise again.

3133
02:01:06,770 --> 02:01:09,250
I feel like no cheek dots is better.

3134
02:01:10,270 --> 02:01:11,710
Just cause like...

3135
02:01:12,390 --> 02:01:15,170
Just cause I think it's cuter without it.

3136
02:01:19,260 --> 02:01:20,680
I feel like...

3137
02:01:20,680 --> 02:01:24,120
I feel like it's just cuter without it though.

3138
02:01:27,290 --> 02:01:28,350
Pull please.

3139
02:01:28,510 --> 02:01:29,050
Okay.

3140
02:01:29,870 --> 02:01:30,570
Maybe...

3141
02:01:30,570 --> 02:01:32,190
Cheek dots for me.

3142
02:01:32,350 --> 02:01:34,610
I don't want to be cute.

3143
02:01:37,450 --> 02:01:38,150
I...

3144
02:01:39,430 --> 02:01:40,130
Sorry.

3145
02:01:40,230 --> 02:01:42,270
That one guy does not want cheek dots.

3146
02:01:42,330 --> 02:01:44,790
He does not want to be cute, guys.

3147
02:01:45,050 --> 02:01:47,990
He doesn't want to be cute.

3148
02:01:51,850 --> 02:01:52,910
It's like...

3149
02:01:52,910 --> 02:01:55,490
A real man doesn't have...

3150
02:01:55,490 --> 02:01:56,050
Cheek dots.

3151
02:01:59,890 --> 02:02:00,570
Okay.

3152
02:02:03,290 --> 02:02:03,970
Okay.

3153
02:02:04,230 --> 02:02:04,910
Anyway.

3154
02:02:06,410 --> 02:02:08,590
I want to be cute though.

3155
02:02:09,510 --> 02:02:11,190
I want to be cute.

3156
02:02:11,650 --> 02:02:12,930
Fuck that guy.

3157
02:02:13,310 --> 02:02:14,870
I think like merchant...

3158
02:02:14,870 --> 02:02:15,730
Like plush wise.

3159
02:02:16,110 --> 02:02:18,350
I think it's easier to...

3160
02:02:18,350 --> 02:02:19,010
I think it's...

3161
02:02:19,010 --> 02:02:20,530
It's better...

3162
02:02:20,530 --> 02:02:22,930
For them to not have cheek dots.

3163
02:02:23,070 --> 02:02:24,630
Because like plush wise.

3164
02:02:24,630 --> 02:02:27,490
I personally think plush wise.

3165
02:02:27,610 --> 02:02:28,510
No cheek dots.

3166
02:02:29,250 --> 02:02:30,330
Look better.

3167
02:02:31,930 --> 02:02:32,810
Versus like...

3168
02:02:33,750 --> 02:02:34,290
When...

3169
02:02:34,290 --> 02:02:36,550
You look at stuff like...

3170
02:02:36,550 --> 02:02:37,630
In real life.

3171
02:02:37,990 --> 02:02:40,090
Because it's hard to make cheek dots work.

3172
02:02:40,850 --> 02:02:41,950
On a plush.

3173
02:02:42,090 --> 02:02:43,630
On a plush.

3174
02:02:45,210 --> 02:02:45,750
No!

3175
02:02:45,890 --> 02:02:46,670
Give it back!

3176
02:02:49,030 --> 02:02:49,570
Alright.

3177
02:02:51,110 --> 02:02:51,650
Alright.

3178
02:02:51,690 --> 02:02:53,070
And to make things easier.

3179
02:02:53,310 --> 02:02:53,490
Oh.

3180
02:02:53,490 --> 02:02:54,030
Okay.

3181
02:02:54,690 --> 02:02:55,210
Me.

3182
02:02:55,690 --> 02:02:56,430
I hope...

3183
02:02:56,430 --> 02:02:58,430
I hope it's okay if I edit the artwork a little bit.

3184
02:02:58,470 --> 02:02:59,750
Just to help me get an idea.

3185
02:03:00,370 --> 02:03:00,890
Alright.

3186
02:03:00,970 --> 02:03:01,710
Let's see.

3187
02:03:02,130 --> 02:03:03,310
And to help it...

3188
02:03:04,610 --> 02:03:05,130
Sinking.

3189
02:03:05,270 --> 02:03:06,630
Maybe like...

3190
02:03:10,780 --> 02:03:11,620
Like this.

3191
02:03:14,600 --> 02:03:16,660
I think maybe like a belly.

3192
02:03:16,780 --> 02:03:17,540
A white belly.

3193
02:03:22,600 --> 02:03:24,700
You want a white belly or nah?

3194
02:03:28,870 --> 02:03:29,630
Let's see.

3195
02:03:32,710 --> 02:03:34,030
A little white belly.

3196
02:03:34,310 --> 02:03:35,590
Maybe look like this.

3197
02:03:36,830 --> 02:03:38,090
For the white belly.

3198
02:03:44,340 --> 02:03:45,080
Like that?

3199
02:03:46,340 --> 02:03:47,960
It's not just all yellow.

3200
02:03:47,980 --> 02:03:48,880
At that point.

3201
02:03:49,120 --> 02:03:50,680
Like there's more colors to it.

3202
02:03:51,600 --> 02:03:52,100
Hat?

3203
02:03:52,280 --> 02:03:52,520
No!

3204
02:03:52,740 --> 02:03:53,400
What the fuck?

3205
02:03:53,420 --> 02:03:54,240
This is my hat.

3206
02:03:54,560 --> 02:03:55,560
Find your own hat.

3207
02:04:00,800 --> 02:04:02,100
What the fuck?

3208
02:04:02,180 --> 02:04:03,360
Find your own hat!

3209
02:04:04,580 --> 02:04:06,660
You're not gonna have hats!

3210
02:04:07,880 --> 02:04:10,600
You're like, team fortress gives you hats.

3211
02:04:10,940 --> 02:04:11,340
Yeah!

3212
02:04:11,560 --> 02:04:14,000
Then fucking go Oshi team fortress too!

3213
02:04:15,060 --> 02:04:15,700
Okay.

3214
02:04:18,060 --> 02:04:18,700
Alright.

3215
02:04:18,980 --> 02:04:20,060
I have an idea.

3216
02:04:20,320 --> 02:04:20,740
Alright.

3217
02:04:20,780 --> 02:04:22,100
This is a default form.

3218
02:04:22,620 --> 02:04:23,500
Right here.

3219
02:04:23,580 --> 02:04:25,120
This is gonna be default guy.

3220
02:04:25,380 --> 02:04:26,680
And then...

3221
02:04:28,140 --> 02:04:28,780
Long...

3222
02:04:28,780 --> 02:04:31,500
Longoon would be like...

3223
02:04:31,500 --> 02:04:32,160
Yeah.

3224
02:04:34,550 --> 02:04:35,190
Yeah.

3225
02:04:35,190 --> 02:04:36,450
This is Longoon.

3226
02:04:39,900 --> 02:04:41,380
Just like that.

3227
02:04:41,600 --> 02:04:44,060
Longoon has evolved to...

3228
02:04:50,240 --> 02:04:51,560
He's like a little...

3229
02:04:51,560 --> 02:04:52,480
How the fuck do I...

3230
02:04:52,480 --> 02:04:53,700
Do like...

3231
02:04:53,700 --> 02:04:54,560
The shape.

3232
02:04:54,960 --> 02:04:56,180
I can't.

3233
02:05:07,180 --> 02:05:09,160
And then Longoon.

3234
02:05:09,360 --> 02:05:10,040
Longoon!

3235
02:05:11,540 --> 02:05:14,120
Oh my gosh!

3236
02:05:20,840 --> 02:05:21,340
I'm sorry.

3237
02:05:22,660 --> 02:05:24,780
My god, it's like...

3238
02:05:25,840 --> 02:05:27,200
Okay, maybe...

3239
02:05:27,360 --> 02:05:28,200
Okay.

3240
02:05:28,700 --> 02:05:31,120
The little R's.

3241
02:05:35,560 --> 02:05:36,580
The little...

3242
02:05:36,580 --> 02:05:39,520
The little R's.

3243
02:05:40,540 --> 02:05:41,640
It's so good.

3244
02:05:42,380 --> 02:05:43,500
Oh my god.

3245
02:05:44,360 --> 02:05:45,960
It's so good.

3246
02:05:46,040 --> 02:05:49,640
I love the little R's.

3247
02:05:51,040 --> 02:05:52,260
Oh my god.

3248
02:05:52,680 --> 02:05:53,280
Alright.

3249
02:05:53,680 --> 02:05:54,840
The arms.

3250
02:05:54,940 --> 02:05:56,320
It's so good.

3251
02:05:56,800 --> 02:05:59,500
And the 60 eyes on this one.

3252
02:05:59,580 --> 02:06:02,980
I think that's why it's been bothering me for the longest time.

3253
02:06:06,380 --> 02:06:07,540
Oh my god.

3254
02:06:07,600 --> 02:06:08,120
I'm sorry.

3255
02:06:08,280 --> 02:06:11,820
The long goons arms are so funny.

3256
02:06:14,080 --> 02:06:15,140
Oh my god.

3257
02:06:15,200 --> 02:06:16,040
I can't fucking...

3258
02:06:16,040 --> 02:06:16,840
I hate this.

3259
02:06:17,060 --> 02:06:18,280
I'm trying to do the eyes.

3260
02:06:18,980 --> 02:06:19,580
Alright.

3261
02:06:20,880 --> 02:06:21,780
That's so...

3262
02:06:21,780 --> 02:06:22,260
Sorry.

3263
02:06:25,480 --> 02:06:26,240
Alright.

3264
02:06:26,340 --> 02:06:27,700
And then the chon...

3265
02:06:27,700 --> 02:06:29,340
I'm thinking about like chonky goon.

3266
02:06:29,800 --> 02:06:32,320
The chonky goon is like...

3267
02:06:32,840 --> 02:06:33,980
No legs.

3268
02:06:34,560 --> 02:06:37,180
Why is the chonky goon is just...

3269
02:06:37,660 --> 02:06:39,700
It's just no legs.

3270
02:06:39,840 --> 02:06:40,960
It's just...

3271
02:06:46,560 --> 02:06:47,320
Alright.

3272
02:06:47,560 --> 02:06:49,980
The chonky goon is just...

3273
02:06:51,740 --> 02:06:54,640
I'm trying to think how the chonky goon would look like.

3274
02:06:54,820 --> 02:06:55,760
Is it just that?

3275
02:06:57,260 --> 02:06:59,280
Just the head?

3276
02:07:00,680 --> 02:07:01,320
Okay.

3277
02:07:01,800 --> 02:07:02,920
Okay you guys.

3278
02:07:03,180 --> 02:07:05,360
Evolution didn't do you so well.

3279
02:07:05,660 --> 02:07:08,820
Evolution didn't do you so well.

3280
02:07:10,860 --> 02:07:13,640
You don't even have legs or arms.

3281
02:07:13,680 --> 02:07:14,540
You're just...

3282
02:07:14,540 --> 02:07:15,920
You're just a head.

3283
02:07:17,880 --> 02:07:19,940
You don't even have legs or arms.

3284
02:07:19,940 --> 02:07:22,540
Or maybe I could do like...

3285
02:07:25,620 --> 02:07:28,240
Just like... tiny...

3286
02:07:29,600 --> 02:07:31,680
Tiny head... no, just that.

3287
02:07:31,980 --> 02:07:33,200
You're just a head.

3288
02:07:34,280 --> 02:07:36,260
I love... I'm sorry, Longoon...

3289
02:07:36,260 --> 02:07:39,060
I love Longoon the most!

3290
02:07:39,580 --> 02:07:40,900
Oh my god!

3291
02:07:42,040 --> 02:07:43,060
Oh my god!

3292
02:07:45,680 --> 02:07:46,080
Hello.

3293
02:07:46,840 --> 02:07:47,640
Wait!

3294
02:07:51,200 --> 02:07:51,800
Wait!

3295
02:07:52,360 --> 02:07:53,380
Wait a minute!

3296
02:07:54,340 --> 02:07:56,160
Wait, okay, but wait...

3297
02:07:57,020 --> 02:07:58,100
Wait a minute.

3298
02:07:58,260 --> 02:07:59,320
Okay, okay, guys.

3299
02:07:59,560 --> 02:08:00,160
Okay.

3300
02:08:01,100 --> 02:08:03,300
Should this be Chonky Goon?

3301
02:08:04,800 --> 02:08:07,800
Should this be Chonky Goon?

3302
02:08:09,660 --> 02:08:11,520
Why did we just do all head?

3303
02:08:11,740 --> 02:08:12,940
I can't tell.

3304
02:08:14,280 --> 02:08:15,900
The missing link.

3305
02:08:16,060 --> 02:08:18,040
The missing link.

3306
02:08:19,940 --> 02:08:22,460
I can't tell if we should have this...

3307
02:08:22,460 --> 02:08:23,500
Or...

3308
02:08:23,500 --> 02:08:25,600
Wait, what if this is the normal form?

3309
02:08:25,740 --> 02:08:27,320
We could have this as the normal...

3310
02:08:27,320 --> 02:08:28,080
I can't tell!

3311
02:08:28,800 --> 02:08:29,400
That's...

3312
02:08:29,660 --> 02:08:30,440
Make that...

3313
02:08:30,440 --> 02:08:31,440
Yeah, this...

3314
02:08:31,440 --> 02:08:32,740
What is the base?

3315
02:08:33,160 --> 02:08:34,100
This should...

3316
02:08:34,100 --> 02:08:38,060
I don't...

3317
02:08:38,060 --> 02:08:41,500
I don't know if this is the base design.

3318
02:08:42,500 --> 02:08:43,700
I can't tell!

3319
02:08:43,840 --> 02:08:44,940
It's so good!

3320
02:08:46,180 --> 02:08:47,300
The stick...

3321
02:08:47,300 --> 02:08:48,680
The stick legs...

3322
02:08:48,680 --> 02:08:49,060
Were...

3323
02:08:49,330 --> 02:08:50,740
Were just all head.

3324
02:08:51,510 --> 02:08:53,040
It just goes back.

3325
02:08:53,480 --> 02:08:55,860
The twig legs are so good though!

3326
02:08:57,820 --> 02:09:00,040
Oh yeah, I forgot the horns for each too.

3327
02:09:00,400 --> 02:09:02,200
No, the Longu didn't have horns.

3328
02:09:02,440 --> 02:09:03,660
Longu never had horns.

3329
02:09:04,400 --> 02:09:05,600
It was...

3330
02:09:06,400 --> 02:09:07,140
Only...

3331
02:09:07,410 --> 02:09:07,780
Uh...

3332
02:09:08,840 --> 02:09:09,580
Uh...

3333
02:09:09,580 --> 02:09:12,600
Stick legs with no horns.

3334
02:09:13,470 --> 02:09:15,600
We're never gonna win wars!

3335
02:09:17,600 --> 02:09:18,660
I can't...

3336
02:09:18,660 --> 02:09:19,040
I can't tell!

3337
02:09:19,180 --> 02:09:21,400
I can't tell if I want you guys to...

3338
02:09:21,400 --> 02:09:22,520
I don't...

3339
02:09:22,520 --> 02:09:24,900
If I want you guys to be all head...

3340
02:09:24,900 --> 02:09:25,780
Or...

3341
02:09:25,780 --> 02:09:27,000
Or like...

3342
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:27,860
With the little legs...

3343
02:09:28,320 --> 02:09:29,520
Because it's so funny.

3344
02:09:29,740 --> 02:09:31,360
It's so funny.

3345
02:09:32,900 --> 02:09:33,500
Bro...

3346
02:09:33,500 --> 02:09:36,160
Both legs that help hold up the chunk.

3347
02:09:36,500 --> 02:09:37,360
It's like...

3348
02:09:37,360 --> 02:09:38,080
It's like...

3349
02:09:38,080 --> 02:09:39,540
I stand up.

3350
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:40,940
It's like...

3351
02:09:40,940 --> 02:09:43,620
You know like those memes where it's like...

3352
02:09:43,620 --> 02:09:44,220
Oh, he's...

3353
02:09:44,220 --> 02:09:45,420
He's so fucking weak.

3354
02:09:45,500 --> 02:09:46,100
And then...

3355
02:09:46,100 --> 02:09:47,280
And he gets up.

3356
02:09:47,300 --> 02:09:47,660
It's like...

3357
02:09:47,660 --> 02:09:48,520
What'd you say?

3358
02:09:48,560 --> 02:09:48,640
And then...

3359
02:09:49,740 --> 02:09:50,220
He's like...

3360
02:09:50,220 --> 02:09:51,080
What'd you say?

3361
02:09:51,200 --> 02:09:51,460
He's like...

3362
02:09:51,460 --> 02:09:52,920
He's not gonna catch me.

3363
02:09:52,960 --> 02:09:53,920
He has no legs!

3364
02:09:54,860 --> 02:09:57,000
And then he just stands up and he's like...

3365
02:09:57,000 --> 02:09:58,280
Say it to my face!

3366
02:10:02,400 --> 02:10:03,820
They look like...

3367
02:10:04,400 --> 02:10:04,880
Nesticles.

3368
02:10:06,580 --> 02:10:07,900
How would the plush work?

3369
02:10:08,120 --> 02:10:08,580
It's like...

3370
02:10:08,580 --> 02:10:09,440
A tiny line.

3371
02:10:09,680 --> 02:10:10,900
It's like a tiny...

3372
02:10:10,900 --> 02:10:11,860
Legs are...

3373
02:10:11,860 --> 02:10:12,300
Okay.

3374
02:10:12,400 --> 02:10:12,700
Okay.

3375
02:10:12,760 --> 02:10:13,080
Okay.

3376
02:10:13,260 --> 02:10:13,920
All right.

3377
02:10:15,160 --> 02:10:16,120
Chonky goons.

3378
02:10:16,220 --> 02:10:17,940
You have a secret power.

3379
02:10:17,940 --> 02:10:19,540
We're like...

3380
02:10:19,540 --> 02:10:21,720
Your legs are retractable.

3381
02:10:22,320 --> 02:10:22,900
Okay?

3382
02:10:23,580 --> 02:10:24,160
Okay.

3383
02:10:29,100 --> 02:10:30,240
Not gonna lie.

3384
02:10:30,500 --> 02:10:33,400
I sort of want this to be the base form now.

3385
02:10:33,540 --> 02:10:33,840
Wait.

3386
02:10:33,920 --> 02:10:34,380
I can't.

3387
02:10:34,420 --> 02:10:37,820
I feel like this as the base form is so good.

3388
02:10:38,680 --> 02:10:39,840
So good.

3389
02:10:40,360 --> 02:10:44,180
Guys, I feel like this should be the original form.

3390
02:10:44,420 --> 02:10:44,960
Okay.

3391
02:10:47,420 --> 02:10:48,000
Bye.

3392
02:10:49,300 --> 02:10:53,340
I just think... I think this should... guys, I'm sorry.

3393
02:10:53,540 --> 02:10:55,520
I'm sorry for this guy.

3394
02:10:57,700 --> 02:11:00,680
But... this guy is so funny.

3395
02:11:01,720 --> 02:11:05,880
Okay, this is gonna be the origin.

3396
02:11:08,940 --> 02:11:13,820
Oh my god.

3397
02:11:15,340 --> 02:11:17,720
I don't even think you... you know what?

3398
02:11:17,840 --> 02:11:19,060
You guys don't need horns.

3399
02:11:19,340 --> 02:11:21,380
I feel like no horns is fine.

3400
02:11:21,820 --> 02:11:22,920
You just gotta tail.

3401
02:11:23,340 --> 02:11:24,640
You just gotta tail.

3402
02:11:29,900 --> 02:11:32,200
I feel like... I don't know.

3403
02:11:32,280 --> 02:11:36,020
Looking at it... I think it just looks so good like this.

3404
02:11:36,560 --> 02:11:40,020
It's just so... bring back my leg, boy.

3405
02:11:40,660 --> 02:11:41,220
Alright.

3406
02:11:42,580 --> 02:11:43,140
Alright.

3407
02:11:43,260 --> 02:11:43,520
Alright.

3408
02:11:43,820 --> 02:11:47,280
Here is... the long goon.

3409
02:11:47,520 --> 02:11:50,560
Long goon, you have real legs.

3410
02:11:50,800 --> 02:11:52,220
You have real legs.

3411
02:11:52,600 --> 02:11:56,860
And then... honestly, I like the first one.

3412
02:11:57,180 --> 02:12:00,080
Alright, how about we make that one the chonk goons.

3413
02:12:00,220 --> 02:12:01,980
Oh, but this one is the chonk goon.

3414
02:12:01,980 --> 02:12:02,920
Makes more sense.

3415
02:12:07,820 --> 02:12:09,040
Oh my god.

3416
02:12:09,120 --> 02:12:10,660
That's why he has legs!

3417
02:12:11,400 --> 02:12:13,040
Okay, chonk goons.

3418
02:12:13,820 --> 02:12:15,260
Base form, no horns.

3419
02:12:15,320 --> 02:12:17,640
Cause you guys evolved out of the horns.

3420
02:12:17,960 --> 02:12:19,900
So, this is the base.

3421
02:12:20,200 --> 02:12:21,660
We're gonna redo all this.

3422
02:12:21,880 --> 02:12:23,020
This is...

3423
02:12:23,820 --> 02:12:31,460
This is... base form... chonk... long.

3424
02:12:35,440 --> 02:12:40,380
This is the evil level 1 versus...

3425
02:12:42,380 --> 02:12:43,580
And then...

3426
02:12:44,320 --> 02:12:47,440
So, you can draw the base form with no legs.

3427
02:12:47,540 --> 02:12:48,420
If you want.

3428
02:12:50,040 --> 02:12:53,680
This can... so you can draw a base with no legs or arms.

3429
02:12:53,820 --> 02:12:55,960
So, base form has no horns.

3430
02:12:56,500 --> 02:12:57,900
He has no horns.

3431
02:12:58,160 --> 02:13:00,680
He has evolved out of horns.

3432
02:13:01,200 --> 02:13:02,980
Just like the long one.

3433
02:13:03,240 --> 02:13:04,480
Just like the long boy.

3434
02:13:05,760 --> 02:13:07,300
Chonk... the chonk one.

3435
02:13:07,560 --> 02:13:08,820
The chonky guy.

3436
02:13:08,820 --> 02:13:11,660
He's still going through evolution right now.

3437
02:13:11,820 --> 02:13:13,740
He's still going through evolution.

3438
02:13:15,020 --> 02:13:16,320
And then...

3439
02:13:16,320 --> 02:13:18,600
And then, obviously...

3440
02:13:18,600 --> 02:13:20,120
There's the eggs.

3441
02:13:20,680 --> 02:13:22,140
Eggs still exist.

3442
02:13:24,740 --> 02:13:26,560
The eggs still exist.

3443
02:13:28,640 --> 02:13:30,440
It's just you have different legs now.

3444
02:13:32,780 --> 02:13:34,840
And now you have weak ass legs.

3445
02:13:35,920 --> 02:13:38,480
I'm gonna have to do my own...

3446
02:13:38,480 --> 02:13:39,360
Alright!

3447
02:13:40,320 --> 02:13:42,800
Alright, let me draw this a little better.

3448
02:13:43,120 --> 02:13:44,700
Let me draw this.

3449
02:13:44,700 --> 02:13:45,920
I love this guy.

3450
02:13:46,280 --> 02:13:49,540
I love this guy so much.

3451
02:13:51,400 --> 02:13:52,960
Oh my god.

3452
02:13:53,300 --> 02:13:55,340
We're still the fresh eggs.

3453
02:13:56,400 --> 02:13:57,820
He's so funny.

3454
02:13:58,160 --> 02:14:00,480
He's just so fucking funny.

3455
02:14:01,020 --> 02:14:02,320
Alright, let me...

3456
02:14:03,300 --> 02:14:05,140
Let me do a better...

3457
02:14:05,140 --> 02:14:07,020
A better line art.

3458
02:14:09,020 --> 02:14:09,560
Okay.

3459
02:14:10,800 --> 02:14:11,340
Alright.

3460
02:14:12,560 --> 02:14:13,500
Let me...

3461
02:14:20,070 --> 02:14:21,150
I can't.

3462
02:14:21,150 --> 02:14:21,830
There's so...

3463
02:14:21,830 --> 02:14:22,630
Little...

3464
02:14:22,630 --> 02:14:23,890
Dead eyes.

3465
02:14:29,680 --> 02:14:30,780
Oh my god.

3466
02:14:30,860 --> 02:14:32,740
When he like fucking stands up.

3467
02:14:32,900 --> 02:14:33,920
And was like, what do you say?

3468
02:14:34,780 --> 02:14:35,820
What do you say?

3469
02:14:37,580 --> 02:14:38,500
Oh my god.

3470
02:14:38,520 --> 02:14:38,940
Let me...

3471
02:14:38,940 --> 02:14:40,220
Badden this guy up.

3472
02:14:41,060 --> 02:14:41,600
Alright.

3473
02:14:43,040 --> 02:14:43,780
The death stare.

3474
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:45,220
I mean he can...

3475
02:14:45,220 --> 02:14:46,740
You can do different st...

3476
02:14:46,740 --> 02:14:46,940
Eyes.

3477
02:14:47,180 --> 02:14:48,380
You can do this eye.

3478
02:14:49,700 --> 02:14:50,300
Two.

3479
02:14:50,960 --> 02:14:52,920
So there's different eyes you can do.

3480
02:14:53,080 --> 02:14:54,880
The non I'm gonna kill you.

3481
02:14:55,020 --> 02:14:55,980
Ha ha ha ha.

3482
02:14:58,000 --> 02:14:58,600
Okay.

3483
02:14:59,040 --> 02:15:01,220
You guys have two different eyes.

3484
02:15:01,640 --> 02:15:04,060
The I'm not gonna fucking kill you one.

3485
02:15:04,240 --> 02:15:07,240
And then the I've seen some stuff.

3486
02:15:07,480 --> 02:15:09,180
I've seen things.

3487
02:15:10,360 --> 02:15:10,960
So...

3488
02:15:11,640 --> 02:15:13,020
There's two sets of eyes.

3489
02:15:13,020 --> 02:15:18,660
Guys... I've seen things and I'm not gonna... I'm okay now.

3490
02:15:20,760 --> 02:15:21,760
And I'm okay.

3491
02:15:22,540 --> 02:15:24,260
But this will be default.

3492
02:15:24,440 --> 02:15:26,760
Just in case, this is gonna be default.

3493
02:15:33,040 --> 02:15:35,580
I just love the fucking...

3494
02:15:37,800 --> 02:15:39,700
I just love the legs.

3495
02:15:39,700 --> 02:15:41,140
Alright, base.

3496
02:15:41,660 --> 02:15:42,940
The base one.

3497
02:15:43,060 --> 02:15:43,660
And then...

3498
02:15:44,560 --> 02:15:45,740
The giant one.

3499
02:15:46,380 --> 02:15:49,220
Or maybe this can have dot eyes.

3500
02:15:50,320 --> 02:15:52,360
No, we'll do... okay.

3501
02:15:52,680 --> 02:15:55,760
And then... the giant one here.

3502
02:15:56,020 --> 02:15:57,840
The head empty inside.

3503
02:15:59,860 --> 02:16:02,160
And then here's the other one.

3504
02:16:05,360 --> 02:16:06,960
And then he's like...

3505
02:16:09,840 --> 02:16:10,940
And then...

3506
02:16:14,340 --> 02:16:18,680
And let me draw this chonky ass...

3507
02:16:19,560 --> 02:16:21,440
This chonky ass form.

3508
02:16:23,320 --> 02:16:24,440
He's like...

3509
02:16:24,440 --> 02:16:25,340
Big.

3510
02:16:26,820 --> 02:16:27,900
He's a big boy.

3511
02:16:28,140 --> 02:16:30,940
And he has the horns cause he's taking a little bit...

3512
02:16:30,940 --> 02:16:32,720
He's taking a little bit to evolve.

3513
02:16:35,580 --> 02:16:38,480
Taking a little bit to evolve right now.

3514
02:16:39,700 --> 02:16:41,400
Sorry, it's incredibly sketchy.

3515
02:16:42,060 --> 02:16:42,700
Cause...

3516
02:16:43,760 --> 02:16:46,160
I'm not ready to really art today.

3517
02:16:46,600 --> 02:16:47,820
It's so...

3518
02:16:47,820 --> 02:16:51,040
It's a little bit very... It's very sketchy.

3519
02:16:51,100 --> 02:16:55,580
But I'm pretty sure somebody will be able to draw this better than me.

3520
02:16:56,740 --> 02:16:57,380
Alright.

3521
02:16:58,020 --> 02:17:00,940
But I'm giving you guys the base design right now.

3522
02:17:01,100 --> 02:17:03,020
And then... his legs.

3523
02:17:03,680 --> 02:17:04,980
His little legs.

3524
02:17:04,980 --> 02:17:05,400
His little legs.

3525
02:17:05,720 --> 02:17:06,940
His little legs.

3526
02:17:07,080 --> 02:17:08,920
That credit here to...

3527
02:17:10,660 --> 02:17:13,140
To Tinn for doing...

3528
02:17:13,140 --> 02:17:15,500
For giving this concept and making me go like...

3529
02:17:15,500 --> 02:17:15,740
Whoa!

3530
02:17:16,780 --> 02:17:17,740
Really like it.

3531
02:17:17,780 --> 02:17:18,700
I really like the concept.

3532
02:17:18,920 --> 02:17:19,900
I wonder if I should give you guys a now.

3533
02:17:20,140 --> 02:17:21,140
And then...

3534
02:17:21,140 --> 02:17:22,680
That's the chonky go.

3535
02:17:23,140 --> 02:17:24,740
I feel like he should be...

3536
02:17:25,560 --> 02:17:26,440
Maybe like...

3537
02:17:26,440 --> 02:17:26,780
Round.

3538
02:17:33,110 --> 02:17:33,590
Okay.

3539
02:17:34,330 --> 02:17:34,810
Okay.

3540
02:17:35,190 --> 02:17:35,670
But...

3541
02:17:35,670 --> 02:17:37,190
What if...

3542
02:17:37,190 --> 02:17:46,050
What if... what if guys... he's like... this big... you know?

3543
02:17:46,570 --> 02:17:54,850
He's like...

3544
02:17:59,890 --> 02:18:02,930
big...

3545
02:18:04,910 --> 02:18:09,350
But like what if he's like... huge... okay?

3546
02:18:12,230 --> 02:18:13,290
He needs to run...

3547
02:18:15,150 --> 02:18:18,370
I feel like I can adjust his chonkiness a little bit more.

3548
02:18:18,430 --> 02:18:18,950
Give me a sec.

3549
02:18:20,690 --> 02:18:22,750
I feel like I can adjust the chonkiness.

3550
02:18:23,630 --> 02:18:25,010
Just a little bit more.

3551
02:18:25,730 --> 02:18:26,890
I feel like it's possible.

3552
02:18:27,130 --> 02:18:29,970
I feel like I can do... make him like more egg shape.

3553
02:18:30,250 --> 02:18:30,910
Oh yes!

3554
02:18:31,630 --> 02:18:31,990
YES!

3555
02:18:36,630 --> 02:18:37,730
Oh yeah, there we go.

3556
02:18:37,910 --> 02:18:39,470
I just need it to be... I just want it to be wider.

3557
02:18:40,310 --> 02:18:40,910
There we go.

3558
02:18:40,910 --> 02:18:42,950
Oh maybe it's like a little bit too wide.

3559
02:18:43,030 --> 02:18:45,990
Let me just... maybe it's a little bit too wide.

3560
02:18:46,530 --> 02:18:47,450
There we go.

3561
02:18:47,450 --> 02:18:47,970
Middle.

3562
02:18:48,750 --> 02:18:50,930
I think we can settle with the middle wide.

3563
02:18:51,230 --> 02:18:51,830
There we go.

3564
02:18:53,190 --> 02:18:54,790
Because he has to be chonk!

3565
02:18:54,850 --> 02:18:55,510
You know?

3566
02:18:56,150 --> 02:18:57,190
He's chonky.

3567
02:18:57,890 --> 02:18:59,530
He's a wide goon.

3568
02:18:59,750 --> 02:19:02,090
And then... long goon time.

3569
02:19:02,290 --> 02:19:06,050
Long goon has evolved away from... has always never had horns.

3570
02:19:07,270 --> 02:19:08,570
So... he's fine.

3571
02:19:13,620 --> 02:19:15,040
They've always been fine.

3572
02:19:15,320 --> 02:19:15,760
So...

3573
02:19:16,620 --> 02:19:17,620
And then...

3574
02:19:21,140 --> 02:19:22,120
And then... boop!

3575
02:19:28,040 --> 02:19:28,640
Yep.

3576
02:19:28,720 --> 02:19:29,820
And then...

3577
02:19:31,820 --> 02:19:32,700
There we go.

3578
02:19:32,860 --> 02:19:33,960
And then finally!

3579
02:19:35,240 --> 02:19:35,840
Finally!

3580
02:19:36,620 --> 02:19:37,220
Egg.

3581
02:19:39,820 --> 02:19:41,820
Now you don't have spots anymore.

3582
02:19:42,600 --> 02:19:45,000
Because birds don't have spots on their...

3583
02:19:47,820 --> 02:19:49,100
On their eggs.

3584
02:19:49,240 --> 02:19:50,000
I mean some birds.

3585
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:51,600
This... this bird doesn't.

3586
02:19:54,700 --> 02:19:56,520
Maybe... actually... I don't know.

3587
02:19:56,740 --> 02:19:57,260
No.

3588
02:19:57,340 --> 02:19:57,740
No spots.

3589
02:19:57,880 --> 02:19:59,860
Because you're not... you're not dinosaurs anymore.

3590
02:20:00,720 --> 02:20:01,760
You're an egg.

3591
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:05,640
It's just... it's just a white egg.

3592
02:20:05,900 --> 02:20:07,840
It's just a white egg.

3593
02:20:11,100 --> 02:20:16,280
Oh cracks in the... no I think... if you want cracks, that's your own egg.

3594
02:20:16,680 --> 02:20:18,060
That's your own egg.

3595
02:20:18,220 --> 02:20:18,440
Alright.

3596
02:20:18,520 --> 02:20:19,980
So there's the base design.

3597
02:20:19,980 --> 02:20:23,920
Obviously you can draw the base design as just a head.

3598
02:20:24,700 --> 02:20:26,560
Because you were just born like that.

3599
02:20:26,700 --> 02:20:32,060
You can either be a headless... headless version or the stick one.

3600
02:20:32,380 --> 02:20:33,960
When you're just sitting down.

3601
02:20:34,180 --> 02:20:38,800
So like when you're sitting down, you guys have no legs, you know?

3602
02:20:39,760 --> 02:20:42,080
And then it's like you retract it.

3603
02:20:42,180 --> 02:20:43,460
You like extract it.

3604
02:20:43,820 --> 02:20:44,340
Hahahaha.

3605
02:20:46,160 --> 02:20:46,680
Hahahaha.

3606
02:20:47,020 --> 02:20:47,480
Hahahaha.

3607
02:20:47,480 --> 02:20:49,660
When you sit down, you look like this.

3608
02:20:49,940 --> 02:20:52,940
And then when I'll be like, alright dragons, come over here.

3609
02:20:53,040 --> 02:20:53,800
You go like, huh?

3610
02:20:54,140 --> 02:20:54,580
Hahahaha.

3611
02:20:55,000 --> 02:20:56,400
You're like, huh?

3612
02:21:02,160 --> 02:21:02,600
So...

3613
02:21:04,460 --> 02:21:07,720
So when you're like, oh my god, Doki's calling for me.

3614
02:21:07,780 --> 02:21:12,860
Okay, normally... normally... it's like either no legs...

3615
02:21:13,640 --> 02:21:15,740
And you're just like... you're just a head.

3616
02:21:16,660 --> 02:21:17,460
This is static.

3617
02:21:17,460 --> 02:21:18,020
Standby mode.

3618
02:21:18,240 --> 02:21:21,400
Standby mode versus not standby mode.

3619
02:21:21,700 --> 02:21:23,600
Go catch it, Kun.

3620
02:21:23,820 --> 02:21:24,820
Okay.

3621
02:21:26,120 --> 02:21:28,140
Stand by...

3622
02:21:31,560 --> 02:21:32,560
Legs.

3623
02:21:32,620 --> 02:21:33,620
Hahahaha.

3624
02:21:38,640 --> 02:21:39,640
So...

3625
02:21:40,460 --> 02:21:41,260
Um...

3626
02:21:42,040 --> 02:21:43,180
So like...

3627
02:21:43,180 --> 02:21:46,040
That is the... that is the evolution line.

3628
02:21:46,240 --> 02:21:47,280
Energy saving.

3629
02:21:47,460 --> 02:21:48,160
Yeah, yeah.

3630
02:21:48,220 --> 02:21:49,380
So this is the base form.

3631
02:21:50,540 --> 02:21:55,020
This is regular... regular mode of dragoons.

3632
02:21:55,220 --> 02:22:03,240
And then... and then this is Chonky Goon, where you guys have not really evolved quite so far.

3633
02:22:03,560 --> 02:22:04,040
Hahahaha.

3634
02:22:05,660 --> 02:22:06,300
Hahahaha.

3635
02:22:07,380 --> 02:22:11,700
You guys haven't really evolved so far.

3636
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:14,540
So you're still just a little bit...

3637
02:22:14,540 --> 02:22:17,400
Little bit behind in the...

3638
02:22:17,400 --> 02:22:18,320
The evolution line.

3639
02:22:18,760 --> 02:22:19,860
And then...

3640
02:22:20,400 --> 02:22:23,080
And then there's the long goons.

3641
02:22:23,240 --> 02:22:24,780
Where you're still long.

3642
02:22:25,260 --> 02:22:27,180
And the Tokimons.

3643
02:22:28,220 --> 02:22:29,380
And then the...

3644
02:22:29,380 --> 02:22:32,400
And then the egg goons are still there.

3645
02:22:32,560 --> 02:22:33,680
They're still there.

3646
02:22:34,500 --> 02:22:35,180
Alright.

3647
02:22:35,360 --> 02:22:36,760
I like this idea.

3648
02:22:37,020 --> 02:22:37,720
Alright, anyway.

3649
02:22:39,220 --> 02:22:41,660
Anyway, let's me color this real quick.

3650
02:22:41,880 --> 02:22:42,320
So...

3651
02:22:43,520 --> 02:22:47,040
Alright, so the colors are gonna be pretty easy.

3652
02:22:47,040 --> 02:22:48,300
It's gonna be...

3653
02:22:48,300 --> 02:22:50,420
We're not gonna have cheek dots at all.

3654
02:22:51,060 --> 02:22:51,640
So...

3655
02:22:51,640 --> 02:22:53,740
It's gonna be yellow.

3656
02:22:55,720 --> 02:22:56,300
Here.

3657
02:22:57,900 --> 02:22:59,720
This is gonna be so fucking rough.

3658
02:23:03,520 --> 02:23:06,040
I swear it looks so much better.

3659
02:23:06,200 --> 02:23:07,040
I'll do...

3660
02:23:07,040 --> 02:23:08,680
I'll like recolor all...

3661
02:23:08,680 --> 02:23:11,420
I'll redraw this a little bit better.

3662
02:23:11,700 --> 02:23:12,960
I swear.

3663
02:23:17,900 --> 02:23:19,780
But these are the colors.

3664
02:23:19,880 --> 02:23:21,000
I like the colors in the background.

3665
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:22,580
I like the colors that this artist chose.

3666
02:23:22,760 --> 02:23:23,780
Because I think it's really cute.

3667
02:23:24,080 --> 02:23:25,760
I always like the little pastel.

3668
02:23:25,900 --> 02:23:27,520
I mean, I could make it a little bit lighter.

3669
02:23:27,700 --> 02:23:28,100
Maybe.

3670
02:23:28,520 --> 02:23:28,960
No.

3671
02:23:29,160 --> 02:23:30,840
Actually, I like this yellow.

3672
02:23:31,120 --> 02:23:32,080
And then...

3673
02:23:36,780 --> 02:23:37,660
Here's like...

3674
02:23:38,260 --> 02:23:40,740
I don't know if I want the little belly now.

3675
02:23:41,300 --> 02:23:44,180
I feel like it looks better with no belly.

3676
02:23:47,640 --> 02:23:48,580
Oh my god.

3677
02:23:48,760 --> 02:23:49,300
But yes.

3678
02:23:49,480 --> 02:23:51,720
Like previous Evolution line.

3679
02:23:51,720 --> 02:23:52,420
You can...

3680
02:23:52,420 --> 02:23:53,680
You don't have to be yellow.

3681
02:23:54,500 --> 02:23:56,360
You guys don't have to be yellow.

3682
02:23:56,440 --> 02:23:58,840
You can be different colors if you really want to.

3683
02:23:58,920 --> 02:23:59,980
So you can be a...

3684
02:23:59,980 --> 02:24:01,240
A green...

3685
02:24:01,240 --> 02:24:02,560
A green goon.

3686
02:24:02,820 --> 02:24:04,480
But like yellow is the default.

3687
02:24:04,900 --> 02:24:06,180
No belly or belly?

3688
02:24:06,280 --> 02:24:08,320
I can't tell if I want a belly or not.

3689
02:24:08,900 --> 02:24:10,260
I can't tell yet.

3690
02:24:11,160 --> 02:24:11,680
Honestly.

3691
02:24:13,180 --> 02:24:14,220
Keep the belly.

3692
02:24:15,040 --> 02:24:17,420
Or maybe we can use like white instead.

3693
02:24:17,860 --> 02:24:18,380
Maybe.

3694
02:24:19,520 --> 02:24:21,360
Maybe white would look better than the...

3695
02:24:21,360 --> 02:24:22,760
Pale yellow.

3696
02:24:23,040 --> 02:24:24,240
But it's true pale.

3697
02:24:26,140 --> 02:24:26,700
Maybe...

3698
02:24:29,660 --> 02:24:32,220
I don't know if I want the belly or not.

3699
02:24:32,800 --> 02:24:33,900
Can't tell yet.

3700
02:24:34,200 --> 02:24:35,420
I need to see.

3701
02:24:37,920 --> 02:24:42,000
Maybe if I put the belly like this.

3702
02:24:42,800 --> 02:24:43,960
Maybe it'll look better.

3703
02:24:44,920 --> 02:24:46,000
I can't tell.

3704
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:49,300
I can't tell if I want the belly or not.

3705
02:24:55,220 --> 02:24:56,580
I can't tell if I want the belly or not.

3706
02:24:56,580 --> 02:24:57,340
Let's see.

3707
02:24:58,780 --> 02:25:00,360
Belly or no belly.

3708
02:25:00,460 --> 02:25:01,040
Belly.

3709
02:25:01,380 --> 02:25:03,040
Belly or no belly.

3710
02:25:03,220 --> 02:25:04,640
So hard to pick.

3711
02:25:04,700 --> 02:25:05,480
I'm so indecisive.

3712
02:25:06,180 --> 02:25:06,860
I'm so indecisive.

3713
02:25:09,140 --> 02:25:10,220
Yes belly?

3714
02:25:11,660 --> 02:25:12,540
Belly good?

3715
02:25:15,140 --> 02:25:17,140
Okay, we'll keep the belly.

3716
02:25:17,480 --> 02:25:18,040
Okay, we'll keep the belly.

3717
02:25:18,040 --> 02:25:21,560
All right, if you guys think belly good we'll keep it.

3718
02:25:21,680 --> 02:25:21,760
All right, if you guys think belly good we'll keep it.

3719
02:25:23,300 --> 02:25:24,620
Let me see...

3720
02:25:26,820 --> 02:25:28,620
Alright, and then...

3721
02:25:31,910 --> 02:25:34,090
Just gonna give you guys the beak and stuff.

3722
02:25:35,950 --> 02:25:38,370
Beaks are always orange, just so you guys know.

3723
02:25:39,190 --> 02:25:40,690
It's always orange.

3724
02:25:42,670 --> 02:25:43,790
And then...

3725
02:25:46,690 --> 02:25:47,250
Like...

3726
02:25:48,950 --> 02:25:50,310
It looks like this.

3727
02:25:50,970 --> 02:25:51,770
There you go.

3728
02:25:52,450 --> 02:25:54,190
This looks like fucking Big Bird.

3729
02:25:57,190 --> 02:25:58,190
I just realized...

3730
02:25:58,190 --> 02:26:01,130
I just realized he looks like fucking Big Bird.

3731
02:26:03,970 --> 02:26:05,190
Oh my god.

3732
02:26:05,550 --> 02:26:07,850
We're in Sesame Street right now.

3733
02:26:08,980 --> 02:26:11,030
Alright, so this one looks like Belly and Noble.

3734
02:26:11,230 --> 02:26:12,750
I guess...

3735
02:26:13,550 --> 02:26:14,430
There you go.

3736
02:26:15,690 --> 02:26:17,770
Or maybe a tinier Belly, I don't know.

3737
02:26:19,700 --> 02:26:20,010
Alright.

3738
02:26:20,680 --> 02:26:22,110
This is the official designs.

3739
02:26:23,170 --> 02:26:25,430
The official Dragoons.

3740
02:26:25,430 --> 02:26:26,870
Big Bird-y balloons.

3741
02:26:27,190 --> 02:26:27,390
Big Bird-y balloons.

3742
02:26:29,890 --> 02:26:34,270
You guys can clearly draw this a lot better than what I did.

3743
02:26:36,510 --> 02:26:37,730
My friendly neighborhood.

3744
02:26:38,250 --> 02:26:38,910
Look at that!

3745
02:26:38,990 --> 02:26:41,130
Longoon evolved into having legs!

3746
02:26:42,990 --> 02:26:43,670
Congratulations!

3747
02:26:45,850 --> 02:26:46,530
Longoon.

3748
02:26:47,190 --> 02:26:49,130
You now have legs!

3749
02:26:49,330 --> 02:26:51,370
I mean you had... I mean arms, sorry.

3750
02:26:51,490 --> 02:26:53,030
You now have arms!

3751
02:26:53,430 --> 02:26:54,110
Congratulations!

3752
02:26:55,970 --> 02:26:56,650
Longoon.

3753
02:26:57,190 --> 02:26:58,450
You have arms now!

3754
02:26:58,730 --> 02:27:05,050
Let's give a warm welcome to the official Dragoon evolution line.

3755
02:27:05,670 --> 02:27:09,750
This is honestly my favorite because of the legs activation.

3756
02:27:15,080 --> 02:27:19,280
I love the legs activation.

3757
02:27:22,540 --> 02:27:24,460
You can grab now!

3758
02:27:25,600 --> 02:27:27,700
You can grab things!

3759
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:28,820
Congratulations!

3760
02:27:28,820 --> 02:27:29,520
Congratulations!

3761
02:27:29,880 --> 02:27:31,340
Oh my god!

3762
02:27:31,680 --> 02:27:32,440
Congratulations!

3763
02:27:32,560 --> 02:27:34,500
I'm so proud of all of you.

3764
02:27:35,460 --> 02:27:36,220
I'm...

3765
02:27:36,820 --> 02:27:38,660
Incredibly proud of all of you.

3766
02:27:38,960 --> 02:27:39,420
Anyway.

3767
02:27:40,400 --> 02:27:41,160
So...

3768
02:27:42,960 --> 02:27:43,720
Egg...

3769
02:27:43,720 --> 02:27:46,480
We all start off as eggs.

3770
02:27:48,060 --> 02:27:50,400
Then, we go here.

3771
02:27:50,920 --> 02:27:56,080
And then, these guys are like awkward in between cousins.

3772
02:27:56,420 --> 02:27:58,340
And the awkward...

3773
02:27:58,820 --> 02:28:02,060
The awkward cousins of the bunch.

3774
02:28:04,120 --> 02:28:09,720
Wouldn't it be funny though if like, okay this is a little dumb, but like you would think that...

3775
02:28:10,080 --> 02:28:15,180
You would think the chonky guy is like the biggest one, but like what if they're like...

3776
02:28:15,180 --> 02:28:19,740
What if like the chonky guys are like this size?

3777
02:28:25,680 --> 02:28:27,740
They're chonky but small.

3778
02:28:28,620 --> 02:28:35,460
Anyway, no, I think like all size... actually I feel like maybe chonky goon would be like this.

3779
02:28:37,020 --> 02:28:41,740
Because like, you know, when you're evolving... when you're evolving you get...

3780
02:28:41,740 --> 02:28:48,480
Okay, so like my logic here is that, you know, like dinosaurs they evolve smaller and smaller.

3781
02:28:48,940 --> 02:28:49,720
But like...

3782
02:28:49,740 --> 02:28:54,080
The chonky goons, you know, because they're going into...

3783
02:28:54,620 --> 02:28:56,300
They're like birds, right?

3784
02:28:56,480 --> 02:28:58,560
So they're still big, you know?

3785
02:28:58,580 --> 02:28:59,880
They're still big!

3786
02:29:02,020 --> 02:29:04,500
So we're gonna go by that logic.

3787
02:29:04,580 --> 02:29:05,800
So next to like...

3788
02:29:06,320 --> 02:29:09,980
Next to them they're like double their size, you know?

3789
02:29:11,240 --> 02:29:12,960
It's just like... just like evolution.

3790
02:29:13,500 --> 02:29:18,060
Their chonky goons are bigger than the base size.

3791
02:29:18,440 --> 02:29:19,720
The base goons are...

3792
02:29:19,740 --> 02:29:20,060
They're small.

3793
02:29:22,260 --> 02:29:22,980
They be...

3794
02:29:22,980 --> 02:29:23,620
They be...

3795
02:29:23,620 --> 02:29:24,200
So yeah.

3796
02:29:24,660 --> 02:29:27,260
There's not much going on in the chonky goons head.

3797
02:29:27,520 --> 02:29:28,460
Just so you guys know.

3798
02:29:28,540 --> 02:29:30,040
If you guys are like, I'm a chonky goon!

3799
02:29:30,260 --> 02:29:31,140
Lore wise!

3800
02:29:31,540 --> 02:29:32,420
There's much not...

3801
02:29:32,420 --> 02:29:33,680
There's not a lot going on.

3802
02:29:33,860 --> 02:29:38,080
And the horns are like sort of like poking into their brains right now.

3803
02:29:38,280 --> 02:29:40,560
So they're still a little bit...

3804
02:29:40,560 --> 02:29:41,540
They're still...

3805
02:29:41,540 --> 02:29:42,540
They're still getting there.

3806
02:29:42,780 --> 02:29:43,300
You know?

3807
02:29:43,320 --> 02:29:43,680
They're...

3808
02:29:43,680 --> 02:29:45,020
They're getting there.

3809
02:29:45,280 --> 02:29:45,760
They're getting there.

3810
02:29:46,640 --> 02:29:47,120
They're getting there.

3811
02:29:48,920 --> 02:29:49,660
They're getting there.

3812
02:29:50,660 --> 02:29:51,500
So...

3813
02:29:51,500 --> 02:29:54,500
So you know, just like cavemen, you know?

3814
02:29:54,580 --> 02:29:56,760
Like the cavemen they are.

3815
02:29:57,260 --> 02:29:57,680
Like...

3816
02:29:58,480 --> 02:29:59,320
Like...

3817
02:29:59,320 --> 02:30:01,340
Base form goon is...

3818
02:30:02,600 --> 02:30:05,700
Is like the 2020s right now.

3819
02:30:05,820 --> 02:30:07,380
Base goons are 2020s.

3820
02:30:08,040 --> 02:30:12,360
And then chonky goon is still 500 BC.

3821
02:30:13,160 --> 02:30:14,000
So...

3822
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:15,140
So...

3823
02:30:15,140 --> 02:30:16,540
So...

3824
02:30:16,540 --> 02:30:18,080
So...

3825
02:30:18,080 --> 02:30:18,380
So...

3826
02:30:18,380 --> 02:30:18,400
So...

3827
02:30:18,400 --> 02:30:21,180
Base goon is like the future.

3828
02:30:21,360 --> 02:30:22,580
Who we strive to be.

3829
02:30:22,740 --> 02:30:24,820
Long and have...

3830
02:30:25,260 --> 02:30:26,440
And a bit thick.

3831
02:30:26,700 --> 02:30:28,980
Long and a bit thick.

3832
02:30:29,300 --> 02:30:30,760
I was thinking if the...

3833
02:30:30,760 --> 02:30:31,900
No, I feel like...

3834
02:30:32,560 --> 02:30:33,400
I think like...

3835
02:30:33,400 --> 02:30:36,140
I don't know if we should have like legs for the...

3836
02:30:36,140 --> 02:30:39,080
Someone was like, what about the stick legs for eggs?

3837
02:30:39,480 --> 02:30:41,180
Alright, let me see.

3838
02:30:41,660 --> 02:30:42,800
The stick legs.

3839
02:30:42,920 --> 02:30:44,440
What would stick legs look like?

3840
02:30:48,180 --> 02:30:48,740
No.

3841
02:30:49,020 --> 02:30:49,580
No!

3842
02:30:50,340 --> 02:30:52,020
Wait, actually...

3843
02:30:52,020 --> 02:30:53,040
Wait, actually...

3844
02:30:59,050 --> 02:31:02,450
Okay, do we give the eggs stick legs?

3845
02:31:02,770 --> 02:31:03,330
Or...

3846
02:31:04,050 --> 02:31:04,490
Guys...

3847
02:31:04,490 --> 02:31:05,270
Do we...

3848
02:31:05,270 --> 02:31:07,690
Do we give them real legs?

3849
02:31:07,690 --> 02:31:09,110
Or stick legs?

3850
02:31:10,290 --> 02:31:11,090
Like...

3851
02:31:12,870 --> 02:31:14,090
Do we...

3852
02:31:16,490 --> 02:31:17,970
What do you guys want?

3853
02:31:18,170 --> 02:31:19,770
The stick legs?

3854
02:31:19,870 --> 02:31:20,970
Or the...

3855
02:31:20,970 --> 02:31:21,790
Or the...

3856
02:31:21,790 --> 02:31:23,370
Or real legs?

3857
02:31:24,990 --> 02:31:27,310
Okay, you guys get stick legs.

3858
02:31:27,530 --> 02:31:29,950
Because you're from the base form.

3859
02:31:31,690 --> 02:31:32,970
Alright, there we go.

3860
02:31:33,170 --> 02:31:34,610
This is the evolution line.

3861
02:31:36,090 --> 02:31:37,210
We've all...

3862
02:31:37,210 --> 02:31:39,450
We've all like grew as...

3863
02:31:39,450 --> 02:31:40,290
Grew...

3864
02:31:42,870 --> 02:31:44,450
We all grew, guys.

3865
02:31:44,910 --> 02:31:47,030
All of us have evolved.

3866
02:31:47,510 --> 02:31:49,250
We are all birds now.

3867
02:31:49,510 --> 02:31:51,130
We're all birds now.

3868
02:31:52,770 --> 02:31:55,070
Looks scuffed but lower I guess.

3869
02:31:58,010 --> 02:31:59,370
Alright, here we go.

3870
02:31:59,570 --> 02:32:00,490
Here's the lore.

3871
02:32:02,010 --> 02:32:03,510
You have been named.

3872
02:32:03,970 --> 02:32:07,110
You have all been officially named.

3873
02:32:07,510 --> 02:32:11,110
And given a vision of what you all look like.

3874
02:32:11,190 --> 02:32:14,050
I hope you guys are happy with your new form.

3875
02:32:14,390 --> 02:32:16,450
I love the little stick legs.

3876
02:32:16,530 --> 02:32:17,310
Me too.

3877
02:32:17,570 --> 02:32:19,390
It's so fucking stupid.

3878
02:32:19,970 --> 02:32:21,330
I love it.

3879
02:32:22,310 --> 02:32:26,270
You can be any color for the birds.

3880
02:32:26,530 --> 02:32:29,350
You can be any different types of color if you want.

3881
02:32:31,290 --> 02:32:34,510
But yellow is the default because I'm yellow.

3882
02:32:35,010 --> 02:32:36,490
Yellow is the default.

3883
02:32:36,650 --> 02:32:39,390
But you can be any different colors.

3884
02:32:41,290 --> 02:32:44,430
Reject evolution, remain a dinosaur.

3885
02:32:45,050 --> 02:32:46,950
LordCroesus, thank you for the super chat.

3886
02:32:47,070 --> 02:32:48,030
Thank you, thank you.

3887
02:32:49,190 --> 02:32:50,670
Nesticles, let's go!

3888
02:32:51,410 --> 02:32:53,310
We're not nesticles!

3889
02:32:53,750 --> 02:32:55,550
We're dragoons!

3890
02:32:56,370 --> 02:32:59,590
I mean, if you want pants, you can have pants.

3891
02:32:59,990 --> 02:33:04,370
Like, I'm not going to like... I'm not going to say no.

3892
02:33:05,450 --> 02:33:06,970
It's your vision.

3893
02:33:08,190 --> 02:33:11,450
Anyway, huge shoutout to Tin for the concept.

3894
02:33:11,910 --> 02:33:13,990
I might be lazy and I might...

3895
02:33:13,990 --> 02:33:14,330
Tin!

3896
02:33:14,570 --> 02:33:16,630
If you're watching this right now...

3897
02:33:16,630 --> 02:33:18,010
I might commission you to do this.

3898
02:33:18,030 --> 02:33:22,310
To make a better reference sheet of this.

3899
02:33:22,470 --> 02:33:25,450
Because this is just me fucking sketching it out.

3900
02:33:25,530 --> 02:33:27,630
And I feel like it's so dirty right now.

3901
02:33:27,690 --> 02:33:29,270
It's so rough.

3902
02:33:32,090 --> 02:33:37,470
I feel like Tin will do a better job and put much more effort.

3903
02:33:37,730 --> 02:33:40,530
And I should repay you for such a neat concept.

3904
02:33:40,630 --> 02:33:43,710
I really did like the concept that they did.

3905
02:33:44,050 --> 02:33:48,010
What will happen if Long Agoon is just a nesticle?

3906
02:33:51,510 --> 02:33:54,950
I wonder what it would be like if it just has no arms.

3907
02:33:55,510 --> 02:33:57,490
Oh no, that looks so bad.

3908
02:34:00,850 --> 02:34:02,790
Long Agoon needs arms.

3909
02:34:02,990 --> 02:34:03,170
Alright!

3910
02:34:04,390 --> 02:34:05,410
This is it.

3911
02:34:05,970 --> 02:34:08,670
This is the evolution line.

3912
02:34:10,270 --> 02:34:14,290
Size-wise, Chonky Agoon is much bigger.

3913
02:34:14,650 --> 02:34:17,090
It's bigger than Base...

3914
02:34:17,090 --> 02:34:18,510
Base Goons.

3915
02:34:18,870 --> 02:34:19,550
Default Goons.

3916
02:34:19,810 --> 02:34:21,330
The Chonky Goon is...

3917
02:34:22,610 --> 02:34:25,330
GINORMOUS compared to the Default Goons.

3918
02:34:25,490 --> 02:34:27,210
And then Long Goons is like...

3919
02:34:27,210 --> 02:34:28,030
Just long.

3920
02:34:29,370 --> 02:34:32,850
The body is very similar to the Default Goon.

3921
02:34:33,310 --> 02:34:35,830
He just has a very long neck.

3922
02:34:36,490 --> 02:34:37,550
That's really it.

3923
02:34:37,650 --> 02:34:40,050
And then there's Agoon with his fucking stick legs.

3924
02:34:40,430 --> 02:34:40,790
Alright!

3925
02:34:41,030 --> 02:34:42,210
I think we did it!

3926
02:34:42,410 --> 02:34:43,330
We named it!

3927
02:34:43,330 --> 02:34:45,010
We named and gave you guys a form!

3928
02:34:45,630 --> 02:34:46,650
Oh my god.

3929
02:34:46,650 --> 02:34:49,810
This should have been done on like day 2.

3930
02:34:50,190 --> 02:34:51,030
But like...

3931
02:34:51,030 --> 02:34:53,810
There should have been a lot of things done.

3932
02:34:54,150 --> 02:34:58,190
But I did my best!

3933
02:34:59,130 --> 02:34:59,470
Alright.

3934
02:35:01,130 --> 02:35:01,830
I...

3935
02:35:02,650 --> 02:35:07,910
I hope you guys liked the little naming ceremony for all of you.

3936
02:35:08,670 --> 02:35:13,650
And also for the naming ceremony and your true form.

3937
02:35:13,950 --> 02:35:15,410
Your true form.

3938
02:35:15,410 --> 02:35:17,450
My little dragoons.

3939
02:35:18,170 --> 02:35:21,170
My little dragoons that are now...

3940
02:35:21,170 --> 02:35:24,550
That are based off of a military unit by the way.

3941
02:35:24,730 --> 02:35:26,210
Just so you all know.

3942
02:35:29,110 --> 02:35:34,850
It's all based off of my love for Starcraft and military units.

3943
02:35:36,970 --> 02:35:39,410
But now you're now full birds.

3944
02:35:39,730 --> 02:35:42,070
Now you have evolved into little birds.

3945
02:35:42,510 --> 02:35:43,210
But yeah!

3946
02:35:43,410 --> 02:35:43,930
Anyway!

3947
02:35:43,930 --> 02:35:44,830
That was fun!

3948
02:35:45,030 --> 02:35:46,050
I hope you guys had a lot of fun.

3949
02:35:46,190 --> 02:35:47,930
I had a fun time hanging out with all of you.

3950
02:35:48,590 --> 02:35:53,130
I'll be posting my schedule either tonight or tomorrow.

3951
02:35:53,530 --> 02:35:53,970
Monday.

3952
02:35:54,070 --> 02:35:55,790
Tomorrow there will be no stream.

3953
02:35:56,490 --> 02:35:58,250
No stream on Sunday.

3954
02:35:59,770 --> 02:36:00,650
So yeah.

3955
02:36:01,310 --> 02:36:03,690
Most likely I'll post the schedule tomorrow or tonight.

3956
02:36:03,930 --> 02:36:06,550
So we'll see how it goes.

3957
02:36:06,810 --> 02:36:08,150
We'll see how it goes.

3958
02:36:09,110 --> 02:36:11,270
I hope you guys have a great Lunar New Year.

3959
02:36:12,750 --> 02:36:17,570
Can't wait to have my dinner with my family.

3960
02:36:17,910 --> 02:36:20,470
And I want to say again...

3961
02:36:22,030 --> 02:36:22,630
恭喜發財大家大禮身體健康!

3962
02:36:22,910 --> 02:36:23,530
To everybody!

3963
02:36:24,510 --> 02:36:26,490
Happy Lunar New Year everyone!

3964
02:36:26,810 --> 02:36:30,550
I hope you guys have a really fun time with your family and friends.

3965
02:36:30,890 --> 02:36:31,730
Or with me!

3966
02:36:32,170 --> 02:36:33,970
Because I'm your family now!

3967
02:36:37,570 --> 02:36:40,770
You guys have a fun time celebrating with me guys.

3968
02:36:41,270 --> 02:36:42,550
I'm going to call it over here.

3969
02:36:42,630 --> 02:36:45,330
But thank you everybody for joining the membership.

3970
02:36:45,730 --> 02:36:48,490
I really appreciate it everybody for joining the membership.

3971
02:36:48,590 --> 02:36:49,470
All the gifted ships.

3972
02:36:49,730 --> 02:36:51,890
And all the super chats today.

3973
02:36:51,950 --> 02:36:57,490
All the akas, yellows, magentas, and insert other colors.

3974
02:36:59,330 --> 02:37:00,950
I hope you guys have a fun time hanging out.

3975
02:37:01,070 --> 02:37:01,970
I'm going to call it here.

3976
02:37:02,170 --> 02:37:04,730
As always everybody stay hydrated.

3977
02:37:05,090 --> 02:37:05,730
Posture check.

3978
02:37:05,850 --> 02:37:07,990
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

3979
02:37:08,110 --> 02:37:10,510
And if you stay up for me, head to bed.

3980
02:37:10,510 --> 02:37:12,030
Because you deserve it!

3981
02:37:12,090 --> 02:37:13,290
I'll see you guys next time everyone.

3982
02:37:13,570 --> 02:37:14,430
Bye guys!

3983
02:37:14,830 --> 02:37:15,390
Bye!
