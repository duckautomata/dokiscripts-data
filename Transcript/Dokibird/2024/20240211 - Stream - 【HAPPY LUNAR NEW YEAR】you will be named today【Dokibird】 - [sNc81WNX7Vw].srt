00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:55,910

52
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:10,630
I've only, I grabbed that sub-bash of tomatoes from an
artist.

53
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:11,530
I retweeted the artist.

54
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:17,530
I don't have it pulled up at the moment, but shout out to
that artist for the...

55
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:24,150
tomato badge i have no idea all of these are like
placeholders right now because like i'm gonna be having a

56
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:34,530
new mama not very soon so so like i don't even know what
like my new skin suit's gonna look like you know when i shed

57
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:44,230
out this old skin suit and hop into the other one i have no
idea like there's no no no plan going on inside right now so

58
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:51,610
like all we know is that deep within all of us tomato and i
was like that's the safest thing because and that's why

59
00:05:51,610 --> 00:06:00,730
there's all like placeholder emotes as well because i i
don't want to like commission all these emotes and then like

60
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:13,110
be like okay can you reach out later can you i'll just be
like okay um can you like um redraw all of these for my new

61
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:21,490
new skin suit and then so that would be very fucking awkward
So I was like, so like for now, we're just gonna have a

62
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:23,090
bunch of placeholder emotes.

63
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:27,610
I'll just be like, I don't know, I'll just MS Paint some
fucking placeholder emotes for all of us.

64
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:35,670
It might be just like all different pictures of like Doki
Amberdoge there, our resident dad.

65
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:40,570

I will admit, it's a good song.

96
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:44,410
But fuck that song for demonetizing.

97
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:49,650
I like how like before I was like, oh, I don't care if it
demonetized.

00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,390
I's not even monetized.

99
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:57,090
And then I got monetized and I'm like, oh, that's awkward.

100
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:02,570
I was like, yeah, I don't have the word.

101
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:16,410

dokey you got monetized right after oh my okay you know like

102
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:28,250
the sudden realization that I had um I had like a sudden
realization today because if you guys didn't know uh wonder

103
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:34,670
fest is uh one one fest is going on right now Some of you
guys are like, wait, what's Wonderfest?

104
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:42,710
And well, Wonderfest is basically like the, like the, you
know, all the Nendroids and the Good Smile Company shit like

105
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:43,150
that.

106
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:50,830
Um, it's like they're really, they're showing, showcasing
all the new like products that they're releasing.

107
00:10:51,550 --> 00:11:02,310
And I, did you guys know that I did not know this, but
they're going to be releasing pretty fast there.

108
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:03,410
Nendroid.

109
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:11,510
And then I realized I was like, wait a minute, I can
actually show that on stream.

110
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:25,470
I was like, oh my god, whatever I talk about, I can actually
show it on stream.

111
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:29,190
I can show the picture on stream.

112
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:31,230
It blew my mind.

113
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:41,350
I was like, I don't have to link the image anymore or be
like all right just google it i can actually show it on

119
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:34,510
make a put like, you can put like a head of like a, you can

120
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:35,590
Fazbear's head.

121
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:40,330
Like, you can put Freddy Fazbear's head on different
nendroids.

122
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:44,170
Oh my gosh, the possibilities are endless.

123
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:45,390
I was so surprised.

124
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:51,950
I did not realize, I can't believe Freddy Fazbear has a
fucking nendroid, but yet he is not on Fortnite.

125
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:53,550
I'm so mad.

126
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:01,830
We can do the We can do the bite of 87

127
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:14,210
Oh my god I can't believe it though Where the fuck is my
Freddy Fazbear on Fortnite Like they have an android but not

128
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:24,190
Like a fucking Freddy Fazbear On fucking Fortnite It just
pisses me off It pisses me off But yes thank you every one

129
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:32,350
again For the memberships I really do appreciate who are
wondering who are new here that don't know um usually what

130
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:42,050
uh entails in a membership uh basically membership streams
will include like uh you know like gaming with me uh so like

131
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:47,630
i would open like servers and stuff where you guys can like
play video games with me like for example i'm planning on

132
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:54,630
for next week we're going to be doing garfield card next
week uh so in the member stream and also like uh there'll be

133
00:13:54,630 --> 00:14:01,130
like other types of gaming servers that i might host in the
future like maybe a custom PAL world server or like custom

134
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:07,550
Minecraft server usually a Minecraft server I hope when I do
get it established I want to make that a super long term

135
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:15,910
other servers are tend to be short term because like in the
past I've done like one month of rust like a like a rust

136
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:21,890
server for members like for one month and stuff like that so
it really and then other things will be like you know like

137
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:29,070
sometimes members get to get to decide like the schedule or
like they they get to vote on the schedule and stuff or what

138
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:30,370
to do later on.

139
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:36,150
Also, I would be including, you know, exclusive wallpapers
that would be released in members.

140
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:43,910
And, uh, and like, you know, like, we used to do this thing
called, okay, I used to call it like average movie

141
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:44,570
watchalongs.

142
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:51,330
But now, now that I'm in indie, I can finally call it shitty
movies watchalongs.

143
00:14:55,510 --> 00:15:07,670
Now I can call them shit so they'll be like sorry bad movie
okay shitty slash bad movies watch alongs in in in members

144
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:20,350
so we can we can we usually we usually do that as well so so
we don't have to be like quote-unquote average now i can

145
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:22,710
actually be like no they're actually terrible movies

146
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:38,290
um so so we can do like terrible like bad movie watchalongs
and that's really it like uh members is just like um it's

147
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:45,310
just a lot of like i think like the more fun part is like
the bad movie watchalongs and also the like uh the the

148
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:53,350
gaming streams like if i do like streams where i play video
games with you guys it's usually reserved in members um

149
00:15:53,350 --> 00:16:01,270
unless it's like something like a where there's like a lot
of people or something like that like uh like i think like

150
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:09,170
the one time i made it public gaming was um was apex or
something i think that was the one time i don't remember so

151
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:20,050
there's a lot of streams blur together um but yeah anyway oh
my gosh little life update i contacted um a twitch staff

152
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:31,990
today um and i was so i was very like oh it's so weird I was
very grateful because the Twitch staff still loves me.

153
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:42,130
And he was like, oh yeah, yeah, Doki, if you still wanna do
Twitch rivals or like anything like that, like we will still

154
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:45,150
support you and we will still invite you to Twitch rivals
and stuff.

155
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:51,370
And like, I think they thought that I signed like an
exclusive contract with YouTube because they were like, we

156
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:53,350
thought you moved to YouTube forever.

157
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:56,250
I was like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

158
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:58,190
It's the same thing.

159
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:01,130
I, like, do YouTube and Twitch sometimes.

160
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:02,630
It's the same thing.

161
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:04,430
I'm just dokey now.

162
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:06,830
I'm just...

163
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,890
I was like, no, no, no, no.

164
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,190
I'm just dokey.

165
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:13,870
That's the only thing different.

166
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:16,230
I'm just dokey now.

167
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:20,310
So, yeah.

168
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:24,430
And then, like, the Twitch staff was like, yeah, yeah, we
have, like, this event actually coming up.

169
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:26,350
Obviously, I can't say what the fuck they've...

170
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:30,210
And they're like, yeah, we can, like, get you in on this
next Twitch arrivals.

171
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:31,150
I'm like, yay!

172
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:32,830
Yippee!

173
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:34,350
Thank you!

174
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:36,670
I'm like, thank you so much!

175
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:40,910
I can still be like, I don't even go here, and I'm
participating.

176
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:42,550
I can still say that!

177
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:43,190
Yay!

178
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,830
So that was really nice.

179
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:50,070
I was like, oh my god, thank fucking god.

180
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:51,770
I could still do...

181
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:53,690
I could still do Twitch arrivals.

182
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:55,350
Oh my god.

183
00:17:56,830 --> 00:18:07,430
Like, every day is just another thing to do on my checklist
of, like, all the other of, like, of, like, just be like,

184
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:16,470

would take a VTuber, like, maybe, like, six plus months to,

185
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:24,150
like, get this done in their career, and then I'm like,
alright, gotta finish this in one day, gotta get all these

186
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:26,250

name change your speed run speedrun.com username I these are

191
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:23,270
still my records those are still my

192
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:30,350
I swear, I am, you know what, I'll check that out later.

193
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:36,890
I'm going to see if I can name change my speedrun.com,
speedrun.com username.

194
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:48,270
For those who don't know, in the past, in the past, I've
submitted speedruns on speedrun.com.

195
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:56,610
They're not necessarily speedruns, but like, they're so,
they're so ridiculous.

196
00:19:57,390 --> 00:20:06,590
that uh that like they still accept my runs so it'll be like
something like you know um if there's like there's like 30

197
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:14,410
submitted runs and then like the 29th run would be like some
like one hour something something to complete and then the

198
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:24,230
30th run will be me and it'll be like five hours and then
the mods there would be like you know what it's still she

199
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:30,730
submitted it She's still the 30th person to submit it.

200
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:33,510
So, like, I guess we accept it.

201
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:36,150
I guess we accept.

202
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:37,170
Except for one.

203
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:43,230
There was only one time I got fucking rejected.

204
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:46,730
And it was for fucking Peppa Pig.

205
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:47,830
Because the...

206
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:56,810
Out of all the games I've submitted, Peppa Pig was the only
time...

207
00:20:56,830 --> 00:21:04,810
someone one of the mods rejected it because the mod was like
this is serious

208
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:20,330
like of course the pep the pig mods were the ones that told
me this is serious this is clearly not a speed run and I was

209
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:27,450
just like why why pep the pig of all the games why was it
Peppa Pig.

210
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:30,630
I was like, I would always like, I know.

211
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:31,530
I'm like, you know what?

212
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:38,990
Reasonable that, um, reasonable, uh, that, like, they would
reject me.

213
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:47,290
But the fact that the other moderators were like, he, he, ha
ha, let this anime girl, let this anime girl, like, make a

214
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:48,070
fool of herself.

215
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:53,270
But the Peppa Pig speedrunning community is very serious
indeed.

216
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:56,810
So don't submit, like, joke runs in the Peppa Pig.

217
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:58,090
a big community.

218
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:00,910
They do not take that kindly.

219
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:03,330
They are not here to fuck around.

220
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:05,790
It's a very serious speedrunning community.

221
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:14,430
I still couldn't believe that was that they rejected me
there.

222
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:15,170
But yep.

223
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:16,730
Yep.

224
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:17,870
Don't worry.

225
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:24,730
I Doki will continue on the tradition of submitting runs for
fucking stupid skitties.

226
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:40,750
like how someone chat was like peppa pig isn't just a game
dokey you don't understand there are like 0.001 like uh what

227
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:47,910

okay guys you can tell sorry I'm like a professional

228
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:56,710
speedrunner I do have like records on speedrun.com but like
uh I like invent my own terms okay that's what professionals

229
00:22:56,830 --> 00:23:05,370
do we don't use the established terms that you normies out
there use we have our own specific personalized terms um

230
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:08,970
that only people within the speedrun community uses so

231
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:22,630
oh my god uh but that reminds me that i do have i should i
should i should make a new speedrun.com account okay guys

232
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:30,670
all right so um later on i'll be showing you guys uh The
Lunar New Year merch that'll be recently seen not today

233
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:41,130
because that'll be fucking crazy Me like I already have a
lot of things to do so it will not be released today even

234
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:50,450
though You know it would be the perfect time to release it
but like we me Mr. Man little man have a lot of work to do

235
00:23:50,450 --> 00:24:01,350
with our current orders and our current and our um uh our
current like workload that we have to do so they'll be

236
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:12,250
released much later but like oh my gosh so there was this
one artist i uh contacted how much merch are we buying

237
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:22,690
double merch look guys rebuilding a shrine is a lot of work
also i don't mind if you guys like uh merge shrines and

238
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:34,610
stuff because you know it was so me and this current time is
still me inside so no matter what form i take we all know

239
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:45,190
within side me was still a tomato so like like you might not
have seen a tomato inside the other the other one but there

240
00:24:45,190 --> 00:25:00,390
was a tomato inside inside of it so this is so in the end if
you want merge forms more shrines that's cool by me that's

241
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:11,690
cool by me like in the end there was always a tomato um but
yeah oh yeah speaking of i did not realize my tomato mama

242
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:20,110
was the person that made the shrimp miku because that shit
like i saw that what that comic went viral and i was like

243
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:32,650
what the wait who's this wait was this the person because
like i I remember I remember the day I asked them to make me

244
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:41,250
a to make my true for my tomato for him and it was like um
it was like on tumblr

245
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:56,720
that's why never I never realized what their twitter was I
like asked on tumblr so I was just like oh my god it's a

246
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:06,640
shrimp Miku so who those who don't know who the shrimp miku
artist was um the shrimp miku artist was the one that did

247
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:17,640
the shrimp miku i know it's it's so the the shrimp cooking
miku um that was you know like the hatsune miku contest that

248
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:26,700
they that they like host every winter so like um like their
design went viral and then like everybody really liked it

249
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:30,060
because the shrimp miku Miku was holding a knife.

250
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:35,340
Like, you know, they were like, no, Miku does not hold
knives.

251
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:42,860
I think that was like the funniest reasons why I never went
into the finals because they're like, no.

252
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,840
No knives for Miku.

253
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,260
It's like how they're like, Mickey Mouse must never hold a
knife.

254
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,440
Mickey Mouse must always be PG.

255
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,360
Mickey Mouse must never have a purse.

256
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:58,120
I know that you can be like the recent Mickey cartoon.

257
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:04,780
with the really funky art style that show was really good
that was a really good cartoon show but like if you guys

258
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:14,540
didn't know like the the handling of mickey mouse was oh my
god i can literally pick up put a picture of of mickey mouse

259
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:24,840
on my screen also the fact that it's public domain anyway so
like the the steamboat willy mickey but anyway but like like

260
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:34,500
the the thing about headlines about Mickey is that he must
not have a personality or like his personality must be

261
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:45,260
generic as fuck so that anyone can like so that so that like
he doesn't like he doesn't have any ideals that you can

262
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:54,520
imprint on him so he has to be like super generic with like
so that he does not

263
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,000
why Mickey cannot hold it.

264
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:04,340
Mickey cannot do any of those bad things.

265
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:09,000
Mickey is a self-insert.

266
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:14,980
I mean, even if it was a self-insert, if it was a
self-insert, at least he would have a personality.

267
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:21,700
But Mickey Mouse is meant to have no personality or like the
most generic fucking personality out there.

268
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:30,100
Um, because they don't want to like, because like he's now
just a mascot of like disney he's not like an actual like

269
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:40,620
he's not real i mean he i'm sorry he was never real but like
he he's just like the face of the company type deal like a

270
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:51,160
little puppet for everybody he's not like an actual like per
like a actual personality anymore um he's a jrpg protagonist

271
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:55,560
that Oh my god.

272
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,260
Oh yeah, a little fun fact.

273
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,200
Also another fucking fun fact.

274
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:05,360
You know like those that time when I like all I did to pass
the time was either play video games.

275
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,860
He's real to me.

276
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:14,960
What's it like to have the most fucking generic character as
your favorite Disney character?

277
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:18,560
I swear.

278
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:24,860
Even though like Mickey is like the face of Disney, he's
never the most he's never.

279
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:32,460
the favorite he's just like he's never the fucking favorite
if you ask people like who's your favorite Disney character

280
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:41,160
I more people would say Donald Duck then fucking Mickey
because like at least Donald has an actual personality and

281
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:49,260
shit like at least like people like fucking relates relates
to him because you're like wow my god he's like he's like

282
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:50,360
somebody that has a

283
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,000
Mickey Mouse.

284
00:29:56,620 --> 00:30:01,780
Unless you want to buy, like, his Mickey ears that are,
like, $30 over price.

285
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,820
I can say all that.

286
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:08,340
I mean, I feel like I used to say this stuff, too.

287
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:10,800
But, like, I wouldn't be as harsh.

288
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:15,880
But now I'm like, now I'm like, well, I can sort of be
harsher now.

289
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:24,020
Unless Disney, if you want to sponsor me, I didn't mean all
that.

290
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:24,660
I swear.

291
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,740
I swear to God, I still love Disney.

292
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,060
I still love Disney.

293
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:34,900
Just not, not, Mickey's just not my thing.

294
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,800
I still, I still love Disney.

295
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:38,560
Just, just not Mickey.

296
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,740
Mickey is just not my favorite.

297
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:47,640
I think my favorite Disney character is, uh, uh, I think it
is, sorry.

298
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,900
I think it, isn't Donald, Donald was my favorite.

299
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,140
I'm not sure if current Disney is still Donald.

300
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:54,860
You know what?

301
00:30:54,880 --> 00:31:05,420
Because I haven't, I think we all know, Disney movies, so
far, haven't been doing so hot.

302
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:11,940
Like, it hasn't been, like, doing that well lately,
including Pixar.

303
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:16,800
Because, like, the thing about Disney, I like how this is,
like, happy Lunar New Year.

304
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:22,980
But I'm just going off these, like, random fucking tangents
that are unrelated to Lunar New Year.

305
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:36,500
But, like, recently so far, recently so far, a lot of, like,
movies from Disney and Pixar are, like, all the franchises

306
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:43,980
that Disney owns, which is a lot of them, have been, like,
set to, like, they've, like, made so much money, and they're

307
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:52,620
so scared to fail now, that they go through the same fucking
formula over and over and over again.

308
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:59,700
making a new IP because they don't want to fail even more.

309
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:07,460
Because the last time they tried to make new IPs now, like
the last five years, is the fact that like, it didn't do so

310
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:07,860
well.

311
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:15,120
So now they're banking on nostalgia factor and making 5 to
10 plus sequels now.

312
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,680
Like, what did they say?

313
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:18,000
These are like this year.

314
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:26,200
They're going to be working on Toy Story, like a sequel for
Toy Story, for cars, for like, there's like so many fuck toy

315
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:36,340
story why the fuck does toy story need another sequel like
it ended perfectly also please tom hanks and the other guy

316
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:51,200
i'm sorry but like not gonna lie the other guy that plays
buzz light year he's really only he's really had his only

317
00:32:51,200 --> 00:33:01,320
like work right now is toy story uh Tim Allen You guys can
be like I know you guys are like But Doki Tim Allen has done

318
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,860
this and this Yes in the 90s

319
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:20,680
I don't know if you guys No But like I feel like If you ask
like A zoomer Right now Who the fuck is Tim Allen They would

320
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:23,520
be like What What

321
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:38,620
it would be like who who is tim allen i don't think any
zoomer right now would know who tim allen is just know it

322
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:50,920
was the 2010s um yeah anyway uh michael theodore mouse is it
really i know like mickey mickey was like based off of

323
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:57,200
something walt disney wanted to like i don't remember i just
They're like, it was something related to Walt Disney.

324
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,380
Somebody related to Walt Disney.

325
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:02,380
But yeah, oh yeah, the Wish.

326
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:03,940
Yeah, that.

327
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,200
You know, like, the music?

328
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:10,260
Okay, I feel like everybody talked about the music of the
Wish.

329
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:20,140
But, like, the composers they got to write the Wish, like,
the music-wise, were, like, top 100, like, pop-song music.

330
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,780
And, like, that's fine and all.

331
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:34,860
music is not meant to be a pop song it's because like also
like pop songs are like usually about like you know like

332
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:42,940
romance and like love and like girl crushes or boy crush
mostly girl crushes they would be like oh my or like i mean

333
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:51,480
girls crushing on boys for like tweens and stuff and and
like and like so they weren't writing it as if the song has

334
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:57,820
a story that builds up to the Because, like, they're trying
to write a top-hit song per song.

335
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:00,360
So, like, none of the songs connected to each other.

336
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:04,020
Because normally, pop songs, you know, they don't connect.

337
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:08,860
Like, if you have an album full of pop songs from an artist,
they don't connect to one another.

338
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:11,680
They're like, there's no story behind it.

339
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,560
Each song itself, it's a story.

340
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:22,760
But not, like, not like a story from one story to another
story that leads up and connects to each other.

341
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:31,080
its own story that doesn't fucking make sense because it's
supposed to they want to have like a trendy song and then

342
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:38,580
here's another story that doesn't fucking make sense because
they wanted to try and get like a top 10 billboard pop song

343
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:50,860
and then um and then she becomes a fucking fairy god mother
i was like all right spoiler because i know for sure none of

344
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:59,520
you guys are gonna fucking My I just watched like someone
else so like this information you're getting from me is

345
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:06,760
basically I got it from another video so now I'm regurgit
you're basically getting a name researched that by going to

346
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:17,480
the theaters or so like this information is like fourth hand
you're getting fourth hand information so because I'm not

347
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:24,100
fucking watching paying money to watch wish uh but basically
and i don't think any of you guys are gonna watch wish in

348
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:34,340
the end unless like i don't know i don't know you're like a
disney completionist or something but basically wish ends it

349
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:41,120
because it's supposed to be a celebration of like a hundred
years of disney so like it's not meant to be it doesn't have

350
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:48,800
its own identity it's mostly it's like a nostalgia factor
based off of like its own IP.

351
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:51,040
So they tried to instill nostalgia.

352
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:55,520
Also, fuck the live action Pinocchio because they did that
too.

353
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:57,100
The one that I watched with my friend.

354
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:05,200
Like they had a scene where it's like, look at all these
Disney IPs that we own that we show with the clocks.

355
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:08,540
And I was like, why the fuck is this all Disney?

356
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:12,400
They're like, they're like, you want to see how much IPs we
own?

357
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:21,340
And it's like, cuckoo cuckoo And then you see like 10 like
hundreds of like Like miniature Disney IPs in like form of

358
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:33,300
Clocks and stuff So they keep doing that So So Um Anyway
Sorry I got a little pissed off because I can't believe I

359
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:41,780
watched Live Action Pinocchio For like it was I watched it
for 15 to 20 minutes And it was 15 to 20 minutes too fucking

360
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:53,800
long At the end of Wish, they were like, like the main
character becomes the fairy, the, what was it, Cinderella's

361
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,820
godmother or something?

362
00:37:55,020 --> 00:38:03,820
They implied that she becomes the godmother, like the, the,
the godmother, the fairy godmother in Cinderella.

363
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,900
And I was like, what the fuck?

364
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:16,860
And then, and then they implied that all these people, like
the, the main antagonist, becomes the mirror in snow white

365
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:28,720
and I'm like why what the why like did they just retcon
their entire Disney lineup like I just it doesn't make sense

366
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:38,500
they retcon like the entire past of like Disney to be like
wish was the OG it was the original

367
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:53,380
So yeah, that's why I'm like, I'm not a huge, I don't know
if you guys noticed this, but I'm definitely, oh yeah, they

368
00:38:53,380 --> 00:39:03,560
made, they made it a cinematic, as if we don't have enough
cinematic universes in the fucking world, they basically

369
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:07,880
made the Disney animation cinematic universe.

370
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:09,680
I was like, really?

371
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:17,580
So, anyway, I saved you guys, like, I don't know how long
wishes, but like, I saved you guys.

372
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:26,580
enough time to never watch wish because it is absolutely it
sounds terrible and like i don't want to put myself through

373
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:33,840
watching it because i feel like i already know it sounds
terrible and i listen to the songs and the lyrics make no

374
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:46,720
sense the dcau the dcau but like like okay Have you ever
listened I listened to one wish song and the lyrics don't

375
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:54,560
make fucking sense Like not even like grammar wise because
it's like they I don't remember the exact lyric But there

376
00:39:54,560 --> 00:40:03,660
was like one part where they're like it's like they use our
a re instead of like I don't know is or something and it did

377
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:10,380
not make fucking sense at all I was like what what the fuck
is going on

378
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:22,660
um but yes okay we might watch wishes members maybe so we
can actually like figure out what the fuck is going on in

379
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:34,960
that movie like it's and then like pix i don't even remember
the last pixar movie like it's so soulless now that's what i

380
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:43,180
don't like a lot for those who don't know a lot of the pixar
staff and stuff got restructured and they left to Sony

381
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:53,880
animation, which is why Sony animation is very Sony
animation is like incredibly like, it's like doing very well

382
00:40:53,880 --> 00:41:05,800
because Sony and DreamWorks, because a lot of old Pixar
okay, Elemental, not gonna lie, Elemental, despite how

383
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:11,320
fucked up the marketing was, it was actually a good movie.

384
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:21,820
like they for some fucking reason they fucked up the
marketing of elemental because for some reason they try to

385
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:32,160
like advertise the wrong thing for elemental so like a lot
of people were like criticizing it and stuff and then when i

386
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:40,060
finally watched it i watched it on a plane by the way most
movies now i just watched it on planes because like i can't

387
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:51,700
i i i don't have the patience to like sit sit down on my pc
because i don't go to the theaters to stream a movie because

388
00:41:51,700 --> 00:42:01,680
i'm always like working and stuff but like it was i actually
cried in like some parts and but like they had like a a fake

389
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:11,180
movie for those who don't know elemental had a fake movie
reaction scene as a marketing thing because there was this

390
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:19,320
rock boy or this like was it this grass boy and like they
try to make him like the funniest character ever like he's

391
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:29,120
like try to make him a comic relief even though he was in
the film for like two minutes this little boy was in the

392
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:38,860
clawed yeah this little boy was in the film we're like two
to five minutes but they try to make him like the funniest

393
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:47,720
shit ever for marketing because like they the official
disney like tick-tock account or something the elemental

394
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:59,320
tick-tock account posted a fake movie reaction to when
claude came on screen screen sorry came on screen and there

395
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:02,180
it's like you know like Big Band Theory laughs and stuff.

396
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:05,960
They inserted like Big Band Theory laugh tracks and stuff.

397
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:07,760
Like, and be like, whoa!

398
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,400
And like, ah-ha-ha-ha!

399
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:12,220
Whatever Claude came on.

400
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:14,320
And like, oh my Claude!

401
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:16,160
And I'm like, what the...

402
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,540
And the movie...

403
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:19,980
And it was like, in a movie theater.

404
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:26,960
And then, like, quote-unquote, movie theater as, like, a
fake reaction marketing.

405
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:39,720
And, like, him so fucking hard and I was just like what the
fuck is he why but then like the movie itself wasn't bad it

406
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:48,800
was pretty decent it was really good but like they made
everybody be like whoa don't watch Elemental it sounds awful

407
00:43:48,800 --> 00:44:03,160
because of the Claude marketing like yeah it's so it was
like the weirdest shit ever anyway um as much as like i shit

408
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:13,400
on new disney old disney was pretty great i still like
disney just not really new disney new disney is just too

409
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:21,740
fucking um formulaic now um i always felt it i knew it was
like getting super formulaic from i don't like marvel movies

410
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:37,000
this is my uh controversial take of controversial take
number 530 today uh I find I never really liked the Marvel

411
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:46,540
Universe because it was it was just this I like you know you
can be like no no but what about this movie it's just if you

412
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:57,240
look into the plot line like the story structure of the
Marvel Universe it's it's the same thing it's like it's it's

413
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:12,940
literally the into like 20 different movies it's so
predictable it's so it's so pretty I will admit like the

414
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:18,320
first you mean like the first two or three of the Marvel
movies other than Guardians of the Galaxy but that is

415
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:27,340
because James Gunn is a very talented director but then but
then James Gunn became formulaic too they like try to follow

416
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:36,500
the james gun formula because they're like because they're
like oh my god guardians of the galaxy did so well because

417
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:43,220
it never felt like a marvel movie it didn't feel like a
fucking marvel movie so then they were like oh my god we

418
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:51,500
gotta copy this now and every fucking movie started becoming
like guardians of the galaxy and it's like they add humor

419
00:45:51,500 --> 00:46:04,240
when it wasn't supposed to be meant to be humor and it's
like that is my that is my rant of the day that is that is

420
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:14,600
that is that is um that is to my rant oh yeah also like
tight tight tight tidy or whatever his name he's also a good

421
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:23,100
director too he he's also like a uh a really decent Then,
like, then Disney tried to fucking...

422
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:25,240
It's like, I don't... They're like, you did so well.

423
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:26,200
Let's copy that.

424
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:30,880
And then it's like, no, the thing that they did so well was
what made it super unique.

425
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,920
If you keep fucking copying it, it's not gonna be unique
anymore.

426
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:36,420
Like, that's the thing.

427
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:41,940
If you keep copying it, it's not gonna be good because it's
the same thing.

428
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:48,260
Oh my god.

429
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:50,200
Anyway, I'm speaking my...

430
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:59,460
truth right now here i need i had like one month build up of
things i wanted to complain about and i'm getting out on

431
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:07,480
lunar new year by the way you're like but donky are we
supposed to have a name in the form guys let me speak my

432
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:21,600
truth then i'll name you guys then i will name all you guys
i need to speak my truth right now um if it sells it's sells

433
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:29,320
yeah but like it's so i i'm trying to remember there was
this director that was like i fucking hate superhero i

434
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:37,680
forgot which director said that but like there was a
director anyway if marvel wants to sponsor me i i love

435
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:51,080
marvel movies by the way just saying disregard everything i
said earlier i was it was just a joke i love marvel movies

436
00:47:51,080 --> 00:48:00,340
anyway um um there was like this one director because like
he said like there's like no more soul it's all about making

437
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:08,320
money at that point um and that's why this director was like
i hate superhero movies because they don't care about

438
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:16,460
filmmaking anymore it's just all about movies that make
money so like and which i agree i agree every superhero

439
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:25,260
movie is all about like trying to trying to not be like good
story wise but like a good enough to make millions of

440
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:39,500
dollars like which is uh uh which i i hundred percent agree
i'm not even like a big movie person uh but like i i just i

441
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:48,700
just don't really enjoy joy superhero movies except if it's
dc animated because the funny thing about animated dc movies

442
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:49,620
is that they don't

443
00:48:53,480 --> 00:49:07,360
like morally correct like they don't care about being
morally correct they actually go to places with their story

444
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:18,600
and for the DC animated movies they actually like care to
like do stuff with their stories and like surprise you with

445
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:28,460
like what they want to talk about um comics wise i will
admit like recent dc like even like comic wise recent dc

446
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:38,540
comics fucking not great uh the old ones were like the ones
in like 10 years ago were so much better versus recent uh uh

447
00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:49,540
but yeah that's my truth of the day i sorry i went through a
long tangent regarding that you know what's cool though i

448
00:49:49,540 --> 00:50:01,460
recently found out that santa claus is like an in in yeah
like in i was like in like marvel universe like in the did

449
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:08,980
you guys know that like i saw like a youtube short being
like santa claus is considered a mutant and and that's why

450
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:16,920
he can live for he can teleport to like houses all the time
and stuff like that yeah he's like i was like what the fuck

451
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:27,880
they made santa claus an x-men i was like oh my god what the
what the fuck um i mean that makes sense also speaking of

452
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:40,900
superheroes i heard like the suicide squad um very poor
timing with the name that i just said out loud okay i just

453
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:51,780
said it out loud i was like oh yeah that's what they're
called anyway i heard the new game for that was um was like

454
00:50:51,780 --> 00:51:02,880
because they're built off of like the Arkham Asylum, the
Arkham Asylum games and like apparently I heard that like if

455
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:09,360
it wasn't in the same universe as Arkham Asylum it would
have been like an okay game.

456
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:20,400
The fact that it was like the fact that it was it built off
of like Batman Arkham Asylum and was also like Kevin Conroy

457
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:22,320
that's his name the voice actor of Batman.

458
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:33,640
that's been a voice actor of Batman for like um for like a
long long long time and that was like his last fucking role

459
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:49,000
and they did him incredibly dirty for his last role to be
fair they did the entire Justice League very dirty and like

460
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:57,980
like I read that like if it wasn't connected to Arkham
Asylum, it would, it would, it wouldn't have been like as

461
00:51:57,980 --> 00:52:05,640
bad as, and so the fact that they fucked over Kevin Conroy
over there, it wouldn't have been as bad as of the

462
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:06,280
reception.

463
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:10,100
And I heard they might be deleting Steam Reviews, so I don't
know.

464
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:12,340
I don't know which is true.

465
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:16,020
I don't know who it is.

466
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,240
Oh, they lied about it being his last role.

467
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:31,480
that's fucked up that's actually fucked up they like they
knew they they knew exactly okay let's spoil it they kill

468
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:40,920
off batman in like the middle of the game they kill him off
and it was like the it was like done very terribly it was

469
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:51,700
done incredibly terribly how they kill him off it's it's
like it's really weird um so like uh so like so then they

470
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:58,380
were like this is going to be his last role and they knew
all right they if they knew how fucked up they're gonna kill

471
00:52:58,380 --> 00:53:05,040
him off and then like why the fuck would they advertise it
as his last role knowing that like in high i guess like in

472
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:10,640
hindsight they didn't know how bad the reception was but
like i feel like if i was in the marketing room and i was

473
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:17,420
like we're gonna kill off kevin conroy i'm gonna tell
everybody that's his last role people are gonna fucking love

474
00:53:17,420 --> 00:53:18,700
that like

475
00:53:25,330 --> 00:53:26,630
Why the fuck?

476
00:53:26,830 --> 00:53:28,710
Who thought people would love that?

477
00:53:30,470 --> 00:53:34,550
Like, people are gonna fucking love that shit.

478
00:53:37,430 --> 00:53:43,790
Like, um, but like, anyway, uh, what was I gonna say?

479
00:53:43,910 --> 00:53:44,330
Oh, yeah.

480
00:53:44,730 --> 00:53:49,730
Uh, that's why I was like, I heard they're deleting negative
Steam reviews, too.

481
00:53:50,170 --> 00:53:52,190
But, like, I don't know if that's true.

482
00:53:52,330 --> 00:53:53,930
I don't know if that's possible.

483
00:53:55,250 --> 00:54:08,530
delete negative steam reviews i feel like knowing i feel
like overwatch 2 would have done that a lot really i was

484
00:54:08,530 --> 00:54:21,270
like if that was possible i feel like a lot of games would
have done it it is it is wow honestly you should you might

485
00:54:21,270 --> 00:54:29,390
as well own it like if you're gonna have nick because then
like at least people would like because like you can get a

486
00:54:29,390 --> 00:54:44,090
refund in two hours like why why are you tricking people to
buy your game when you can get a refund in two hours like

487
00:54:44,090 --> 00:54:56,910
wait they did oh like i love overwatch by the way but i'm
like any big the thing is any big multiplayer game will have

488
00:54:56,910 --> 00:55:06,650
negative reviews on steam because you cannot make anyone
happy like it's it is a hundred percent if you look up any

489
00:55:06,650 --> 00:55:17,690
big multiplayer game with like with like a ranked
competitive system nobody is fucking happy and somebody will

490
00:55:17,690 --> 00:55:31,650
complain like like i swear people be like no you can't say
no that's not true i love blah blah blah if that game is on

491
00:55:31,650 --> 00:55:42,530
steam there is 100 that the reviews would either be like
negative or mixed because people would be like okay team

492
00:55:42,530 --> 00:55:52,670
fortune 2 never had a rank system it never had it never had
an actual rank system it had like fun moments funny ha ha

493
00:55:52,670 --> 00:56:02,110
things to do there but it never really had a rank system and
when team fortress 2 came on steam people were a lot nicer

494
00:56:02,110 --> 00:56:20,510
back then people people were when people were a lot nicer
when it came to like online reviews and also they had hats

495
00:56:20,510 --> 00:56:24,390
nobody would complain about a game that has hats like

496
00:56:28,430 --> 00:56:41,650
like apex i've good oh no when apex first came on steam like
those reviews were not great like i i no no no i remember

497
00:56:41,650 --> 00:56:53,730
because i remember have been forced to download Apex on
Steam and it was like extremely negative the reviews because

498
00:56:53,730 --> 00:57:01,010
everyone that got fucked over and rank is right there ready
to complain about it on Steam because if you give people a

499
00:57:01,010 --> 00:57:02,730
chance to complain i.e.

500
00:57:02,870 --> 00:57:07,550

506
00:57:53,570 --> 00:58:03,570

it is to get to get titan fall three like it's easier to win

507
00:58:03,570 --> 00:58:13,730
a lottery than the other one because like I as long as apex

508
00:58:13,730 --> 00:58:14,250
super chat.

509
00:58:14,510 --> 00:58:15,230
Thank you, thank you.

510
00:58:15,570 --> 00:58:18,610
Hi, too bad for the guy below him.

511
00:58:21,070 --> 00:58:23,450
He did not win the gotcha.

512
00:58:25,050 --> 00:58:26,590
Fastest fingers in the West.

513
00:58:26,890 --> 00:58:27,390
Oh, my God.

514
00:58:27,590 --> 00:58:29,370
Jenny, thank you for the akasupa.

515
00:58:29,730 --> 00:58:30,570
Thank you, thank you.

516
00:58:30,650 --> 00:58:32,410
All right, this person also won the gotcha.

517
00:58:32,570 --> 00:58:33,130
Thank you, guys.

518
00:58:33,210 --> 00:58:35,070
I really appreciate it.

519
00:58:36,270 --> 00:58:40,890
But yes, unless you buy EA, I apologize.

520
00:58:41,290 --> 00:58:43,690
But I really don't think we're ever getting Titanfall 3.

521
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:50,900
Because Apex just makes way too much money at that point.

522
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:59,140
Like, it just, as long as it keeps making money, as long as
you keep buying those skins.

523
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:00,400
I don't know.

524
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:01,760
I don't know.

525
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:04,960
Because I was a fool.

526
00:59:05,060 --> 00:59:06,800
I was a fool too.

527
00:59:06,820 --> 00:59:09,180
I used to buy heirlooms back then.

528
00:59:10,940 --> 00:59:12,860
And then, like, I realized.

529
00:59:12,940 --> 00:59:14,940
Like, the heirlooms were so distracting.

530
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:23,220
I, I, I, for me, like, because I play rank a lot, I don't
like equipping heirlooms because, like, it's just so

531
00:59:23,220 --> 00:59:24,320
distracting for me.

532
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:26,480
And they're so fucking big.

533
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:35,460
But, Apex, if you want to make a Doki heirloom themed, I
would equip, I would buy all your heirlooms.

534
00:59:35,860 --> 00:59:37,100
I'll just give back your money.

535
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:42,640
All right, anyway.

Yes, the Red Pocket Envelopes will be sold as a set.

And there'll be five envelopes per design.

587
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:37,180
So it'll be, like, five envelopes per design.

588
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:47,980
Um, and uh but yeah anyway what was i gonna say fuck guys oh
yeah sneak peek but the one thing i'm um currently working

589
01:05:47,980 --> 01:06:00,320
on now um is a uh i contacted an artist to do like one
singular you know like those like um like a one singular

590
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:11,820
keycap design so it's not a keyboard set or a keycap set but
it's like one keycap um that has like uh uh where where it's

591
01:06:11,820 --> 01:06:19,780
like laser engraved so that light will it'll be like my face
and then like light can shine through it past the line all

592
01:06:19,780 --> 01:06:28,380
right so stuff like that um so yeah artist in keycap it'll
be one artist in keycap design that i'm working on right now

593
01:06:28,380 --> 01:06:37,760
um trying to find a manufacturer also like all these stuff
all these merch uh i personally find the manufacturers and i

594
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:45,480
personally reached out to like research like manufacturers
and stuff for like samples and everything and also um i

595
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:52,860
reached out to artists that that would i think would make
these like i reach out to artists that i think will do it

596
01:06:52,860 --> 01:07:00,620
justice type deal but yeah i'm doing the next merch drop
drop not anytime soon by the way will be an artist in keycap

597
01:07:00,620 --> 01:07:09,680
which is something i've always wanted to get that made um
and i'm super super duper excited and everything so yeah

598
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:17,320
just something to look forward to very slowly and honestly
like doing this is also like stuff i want of myself so

599
01:07:22,020 --> 01:07:32,860
you know i like i want to look at myself more so then i was
like these are things i want personally so like so i think

600
01:07:32,860 --> 01:07:41,440
these are um but usually you can you have to buy like you
have to buy a minimum amount of stock so like it's a good

601
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:57,160
benefit because i can i can acquire these items um and not
have to worry about the extra stock i can because when you

602
01:07:57,160 --> 01:08:04,820
get things manufactured usually it's a minimum amount that
you need to order because I remember when I was trying to

603
01:08:04,820 --> 01:08:13,040
order like I was talking to manufacturers for like red
pocket envelopes they were like um yeah but you have I was

604
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:20,100
like can you like make like a hundred and they're like
minimum order a thousand

605
01:08:25,910 --> 01:08:36,810
I was like oh my god thank god I have an audience now so I
can't get away with that like they're like minimum order

606
01:08:36,810 --> 01:08:50,470
1000 i'm like what the fuck wow oh god that's a lot um um so
yeah i was just like oh thank fucking god at least i can

607
01:08:50,470 --> 01:08:53,850
sell my extra stock that i'm not gonna keep

608
01:08:57,190 --> 01:09:05,950
no it's not like i it's not about like i can afford it's
more like if i didn't you know if i fan base or if i didn't

609
01:09:05,950 --> 01:09:17,450
have an audience i was like what the fuck am i gonna do with
950 of them like what am i like what am i gonna do with all

610
01:09:17,450 --> 01:09:24,570
of these like what and i'm like oh thank god people will
actually buy it this time i'm like oh thank god because i'm

611
01:09:24,570 --> 01:09:34,650
not like a licensed character you know it's not like i'm
fucking sonic or something sonic the hedgehog we're like I'm

612
01:09:34,650 --> 01:09:35,390
gonna buy it.

613
01:09:35,690 --> 01:09:36,910
I'm just me.

614
01:09:37,390 --> 01:09:39,490
So I was just like, oh my god.

615
01:09:40,170 --> 01:09:47,670
Like, think I'm so happy you guys love me enough to buy, buy
the extra stock.

616
01:09:48,090 --> 01:09:49,390
And then I got it.

617
01:09:50,230 --> 01:09:51,170
Why you need this?

618
01:09:51,230 --> 01:10:00,590
So I can use it and look at my, I can use it and look at
myself because I love myself a little bit more now.

619
01:10:04,530 --> 01:10:11,610
thank you for the magenta soup but thank you thank you uh
yes so many options awesome things plan tons of stuff for us

620
01:10:11,610 --> 01:10:15,230
to look forward to thank you thank you thank you for the
magenta soup but thank you thank you i mean i also not just

621
01:10:15,230 --> 01:10:24,450
like merch of like you know merch i get of myself like made
by me but also like i'm super excited to like work with

622
01:10:24,450 --> 01:10:30,890
other like distributors you know like being like like other
companies that want to make merch of me and stuff and that

623
01:10:30,890 --> 01:10:36,750
would be super exciting you know the one thing I'm gonna
tweet, actually I'm gonna tweet that out later.

624
01:10:37,030 --> 01:10:41,550
I'm gonna tweet, wait, where's my, I'm gonna tweet that out,
but I'm gonna add Funko Pop and

625
01:10:47,010 --> 01:10:58,830
Alright guys, my dream collab would be a Funko Pop and a
Nendroid, but like, I feel like it's more, it's easier maybe

626
01:10:58,830 --> 01:11:02,230
to get a Funko Pop than it is to get a Nendroid.

627
01:11:02,670 --> 01:11:08,750
Okay, hear me out hear me out why I would want to get a
Funko Pop.

628
01:11:09,170 --> 01:11:12,950
You had to think of it business wise.

629
01:11:13,530 --> 01:11:16,710
Just think about it business wise.

630
01:11:17,690 --> 01:11:20,650
Why Funko Pop would be so funny.

631
01:11:21,350 --> 01:11:34,730
But basically the thing about Funko Pop collectors is that
they will fucking buy every single Funko Pop to their

632
01:11:34,730 --> 01:11:46,650
collection it doesn't matter if they don't know who that
person is they are insane collectors that will collect every

633
01:11:46,650 --> 01:11:56,210
funky Funko pop out there so then they're gonna see a Doki
Funko pop and then they'll be like who the fuck is Doki bird

634
01:11:56,210 --> 01:12:01,670
I must have her in my collection and then normies my OBS
just

635
01:12:05,970 --> 01:12:14,190
Holy shit My OBS disconnected While I was talking about Fuck
off

636
01:12:17,830 --> 01:12:32,610
Anyway Anyway as I was saying As I was saying You have to
understand Like Normies would be like Would see that at like

637
01:12:32,610 --> 01:12:37,070
Fucking game stuff because who the fuck buys games at
GameStop?

638
01:12:41,250 --> 01:12:44,370
Every fucking and conventions.

639
01:12:45,210 --> 01:12:52,970
There's always 10 to 20 sellers selling Funko Pops and only
Funko Pops.

640
01:12:53,630 --> 01:12:57,650
So a Doki Funko Pops would be everywhere.

641
01:12:58,250 --> 01:12:59,590
It'll be mainstream.

642
01:13:00,150 --> 01:13:01,710
It'll be a hot topic.

643
01:13:02,130 --> 01:13:10,030
Imagine going to a hot topic store and seeing a doki funko
pop like you barely find anime stores because like people

644
01:13:10,030 --> 01:13:18,330
just order online people don't really order online and funko
for funko pops they fucking go to hot topic or walmart i

645
01:13:18,330 --> 01:13:33,190
could be in walmart i could be in fucking walmart i could be
a walmart exclusive Just like think about like the dokey

646
01:13:33,190 --> 01:13:43,090
flocked version I could have like multiple versions of
myself in Funko pop And like and like it could be like the

647
01:13:43,090 --> 01:13:58,110
dokey metallic Walmart exclusive Just business wise it is
the smartest thing I can ever do Like like think about it No

648
01:13:58,110 --> 01:14:00,930
the dokey the original dokey Would be...

649
01:14:00,930 --> 01:14:01,810
Oh my god!

650
01:14:02,130 --> 01:14:04,650
Yodgy, thank you for the 50 gift dishes!

651
01:14:05,410 --> 01:14:05,990
Thank you.

652
01:14:06,210 --> 01:14:08,270
Thank you so much.

653
01:14:08,710 --> 01:14:12,430
Like, I kept different exclusives in different stores.

654
01:14:12,870 --> 01:14:16,970
So, like, the Doki Metallic version will be in Spencer's.

655
01:14:17,250 --> 01:14:22,450
The Doki Flocked version will be at Toys R Us only in
Canada.

656
01:14:22,850 --> 01:14:26,370
Because Toys R Us is apparently bankrupt in America.

657
01:14:27,990 --> 01:14:28,710
I...

658
01:14:28,710 --> 01:14:30,270
The fucking...

659
01:14:30,350 --> 01:14:44,030
the um the two feet tall dokey funco pop exclusive at at
target just imagine the possibility and then they can make

660
01:14:44,030 --> 01:14:50,210
different outfits peep normies will have to collect me
because they need to collect all the fucking funco pops in

661
01:14:50,210 --> 01:14:57,970
the world so like they are forced to look at me and then
maybe they'll look me up you know maybe it's i'm not just a

662
01:14:57,970 --> 01:15:08,430
funco pop in their collection maybe it's they'll just look
me up as well and then they become fans of me and that is

663
01:15:08,430 --> 01:15:21,430
why Funko Pop is my dream collaboration and also Nendoroids
because like that's obviously a better figure and the thing

664
01:15:21,430 --> 01:15:26,990
is unlike Nendoroids because Nendoroids are very picky on
who they pick to make into a figure

665
01:15:30,350 --> 01:15:31,450
Funko Pops.

666
01:15:31,890 --> 01:15:33,850
They love making Funko Pops.

667
01:15:34,170 --> 01:15:36,210
So there is a higher chance.

668
01:15:36,610 --> 01:15:47,570
There is a higher chance of me being picked up by Funko Pops
than it is to be picked up by Nendoroid.

669
01:15:49,290 --> 01:15:54,470
Because they love making, they love licensing things.

670
01:15:55,230 --> 01:15:57,110
So that's, well, that's my TED Talk.

671
01:15:58,250 --> 01:16:04,190
That is my, That is my TED talk for Funko Pop of the day.

672
01:16:04,750 --> 01:16:07,130
Anyway, let me, I'm going to tweet at Funko Pop real quick,
guys.

673
01:16:07,250 --> 01:16:07,770

693
01:17:43,890 --> 01:17:45,730

Jesus Christ.

729
01:23:09,010 --> 01:23:10,990
There's so many.

730
01:23:12,050 --> 01:23:13,850
Oh my god.

731
01:23:14,550 --> 01:23:15,050
All right.

732
01:23:15,810 --> 01:23:23,750
So which one fucking, like, like hit that note for you guys
the most, chat?

733
01:23:24,290 --> 01:23:28,810

01:23:31,050 --> 01:23:46,190

free birds I will not have you guys be free birds that song

736
01:23:57,270 --> 01:24:00,730
is fucking cursed now Oh, that's odd.

737
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:08,200
Anyway, what I was thinking of was, like, Tori Bird.

738
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:10,080
So you guys would be called Bird Bird.

739
01:24:11,060 --> 01:24:12,920
Hello, my Tori Birds.

740
01:24:14,060 --> 01:24:15,460
My little Bird Bird.

741
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:18,620
Okay, I see a lot of...

742
01:24:18,620 --> 01:24:19,720
We're not going to be...

743
01:24:19,720 --> 01:24:22,600
We are not going to be fucking Nesticles.

744
01:24:23,260 --> 01:24:23,860
Alright.

745
01:24:27,260 --> 01:24:32,160
No, I will never let you guys be Nesticles or Free Birds.

746
01:24:32,320 --> 01:24:34,140
I see a lot of suspects.

747
01:24:36,040 --> 01:24:36,560
Hello, suspects.

748
01:24:37,580 --> 01:24:39,300
Welcome to the stream, suspects.

749
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:42,240
Alright, let's see.

750
01:24:42,500 --> 01:24:43,980
Bird Bird is pretty cute.

751
01:24:44,060 --> 01:24:45,340
I like Tori Birds.

752
01:24:45,960 --> 01:24:46,900
Hello, Tori Burbs.

753
01:24:49,020 --> 01:24:51,840
Or Tori Burbs with a B at the end.

754
01:24:52,420 --> 01:24:53,860
So, like, Bird Burbs.

755
01:24:54,520 --> 01:24:55,700
Alright, do you guys like Tori?

756
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:57,060
Okay, we're not... We're gonna have a poll.

757
01:24:57,400 --> 01:24:59,320
But, like, if I put Tori Bird...

758
01:25:00,280 --> 01:25:02,300
Tori Bird or Tori Burbs...

759
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:10,500
Um, in the, in the poll, would you prefer tory bird or tory
burbs or tory burbs?

760
01:25:11,560 --> 01:25:15,520
Do you want to be bird burb or a bird bird?

761
01:25:20,680 --> 01:25:24,260
Is either bird burb or bird bird?

762
01:25:24,940 --> 01:25:26,060
Tory burbs.

763
01:25:26,900 --> 01:25:28,180
Hello, my tory burbs.

764
01:25:29,080 --> 01:25:29,660

766
01:25:31,020 --> 01:25:31,520

767
01:25:31,860 --> 01:25:32,220

01:26:06,020 --> 01:26:08,160

772
01:26:10,380 --> 01:26:10,840
Tomatori.

773
01:26:12,080 --> 01:26:12,640
Tomatori.

774
01:26:12,900 --> 01:26:13,340
Tomatori.

775
01:26:13,580 --> 01:26:14,140
Hello, Tomatori.

776
01:26:14,280 --> 01:26:15,420
No, I'm vetoing Tomatori.

777
01:26:16,040 --> 01:26:16,800
I like two syllables.

778
01:26:17,260 --> 01:26:18,140
All right, guys.

779
01:26:18,620 --> 01:26:19,840
I'm going to be real with you.

780
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:20,800
Two syllables.

781
01:26:21,400 --> 01:26:22,320
Oh, damn it.

782
01:26:25,480 --> 01:26:36,500
I feel like two syllables is like the perfect amount of
syllables when it comes to like names like doki you know and

783
01:26:36,500 --> 01:26:40,750
the other one like two syllables is like the best

Okay, I might like start moving weirdly because I don't know
where my bindings are.

788
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:10,060
Naming ceremony.

789
01:27:14,620 --> 01:27:15,260
Okay.

790
01:27:16,180 --> 01:27:16,820
Okay.

791
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:24,940
The first one is suspects, right?

792
01:27:26,320 --> 01:27:29,300
Suspects with a K ends with a K, I think.

793

799
01:28:31,540 --> 01:28:31,960
All right.

800
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:37,560
We're not going to be nesticles.

801
01:28:38,340 --> 01:28:46,560
I am, I have like unlimited veto power and definitely one of
my unlimited veto power is fucking nesticles.

802
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:49,560
And also free bird.

803
01:28:51,060 --> 01:28:51,740
Tomatori.

804
01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:53,140
Tomatori.

805
01:28:53,680 --> 01:28:55,500
Hello, Tomatori's hooter.

806
01:28:55,640 --> 01:29:00,040
We're not, I am, I know I put hooters in the poll as a
fucking joke.

807
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:03,420
You guys will still, you will vote for Hooters.

808
01:29:03,660 --> 01:29:06,780
And I would, I'm not going to call you guys, my little
Hooters.

809
01:29:06,860 --> 01:29:07,900
Like, I'm not going to.

810
01:29:10,900 --> 01:29:15,520
I am not going to call you guys, my little Hooters.

811
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:17,700
Because that has a different implication.

812
01:29:18,260 --> 01:29:21,720
Funko Pop will never sponsor me if I call you guys Hooters.

813
01:29:23,060 --> 01:29:25,440
Think of a Funko Pop, guys.

814
01:29:26,220 --> 01:29:27,680
Think of the Funko Pop.

815
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:35,500
Um, let's see.

816
01:29:40,160 --> 01:29:42,400
Eagles, night wings.

817
01:29:42,620 --> 01:29:44,700
Today is such a sad day.

818
01:29:45,220 --> 01:29:51,820
Just because you don't get nesticles or hooters doesn't mean
it's a sad day, guys.

819
01:29:52,500 --> 01:29:54,780
There are other options here.

820
01:29:56,660 --> 01:29:58,320
There are other options.

821
01:29:58,640 --> 01:29:59,980
Okay, I see a lot of tomatories.

822
01:30:00,160 --> 01:30:01,400
Okay, I'll put that in.

823
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:02,440
Tomatory.

824
01:30:03,280 --> 01:30:04,120
Tomatory.

825
01:30:04,560 --> 01:30:11,760
And then for the surprise fourth option, I thought about it
a very long time.

826
01:30:12,280 --> 01:30:18,380
And to be fair, this is a surprise option.

827
01:30:19,120 --> 01:30:22,040
I thought about it for a very long time.

828
01:30:22,440 --> 01:30:29,480
But I realized, wait a minute, you can't copyright the word
dragon.

829
01:30:33,800 --> 01:30:36,860
Because it's a real word.

830
01:30:40,020 --> 01:30:45,580
And if dragoons win, it's like crocodiles and alligators.

831
01:30:46,440 --> 01:30:52,860
You know, a crocodile was still called a crocodile millions
of years ago.

832
01:30:56,060 --> 01:31:01,680
It was still called a crocodile millions of years ago.

833
01:31:02,100 --> 01:31:05,000
But it just evolved, you know?

834
01:31:05,640 --> 01:31:09,920
It evolved.

835
01:31:12,300 --> 01:31:21,240
So all I'm saying is that what I'm thinking of when it comes
to dragoons, it's like a military unit.

836
01:31:25,040 --> 01:31:30,120
And honestly, you know, obviously, why did I think about
dragoons?

837
01:31:32,100 --> 01:31:36,060
Oh my god, it's like StarCraft, you know?

838
01:31:36,300 --> 01:31:38,240
StarCraft's my favorite game.

839
01:31:40,080 --> 01:31:42,920
Anyway, obviously, it's a surprise fourth option.

840
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:46,020
It's like a surprise fourth option.

841
01:31:47,680 --> 01:31:48,000
Okay.

842
01:31:49,960 --> 01:31:51,300
All right, here we go.

843
01:31:53,540 --> 01:31:56,080
All right, here's the pull.

844
01:31:57,280 --> 01:31:58,700
Here's the pull.

845
01:32:02,860 --> 01:32:05,940
Nesticles is officially out in the running.

846
01:32:09,060 --> 01:32:10,500
Nesticles is officially...

847
01:32:10,500 --> 01:32:13,480
Oh my god, it's so laggy in chat that it took like...

848
01:32:13,480 --> 01:32:16,660
I felt like it took like an entire minute for this to load.

849
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:26,560
So...

850
01:32:29,340 --> 01:32:31,100
So, here you go.

851
01:32:32,100 --> 01:32:32,460
Fight.

852
01:32:32,620 --> 01:32:34,200
Fight for your name.

853
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:36,960
Fight for your name.

854
01:32:37,380 --> 01:32:39,660
No, Nesticles, my beloved.

855
01:32:40,280 --> 01:32:43,860
Look, you guys had, like, oh my god.

856
01:32:51,750 --> 01:32:52,690
Oh, my god.

857
01:32:52,870 --> 01:32:55,130
You guys, like, fought so high.

858
01:32:55,610 --> 01:33:01,070
For those that wanted to be Nesticles, look, guys.

859
01:33:02,470 --> 01:33:06,710
Nesticles, you guys could have pretended to be Nesticles
when you guys had no.

860
01:33:06,730 --> 01:33:17,850
name okay that's not my fault you had the freedom to be a
nesticle for like six days now okay you guys all had the

861
01:33:17,850 --> 01:33:24,790
freedom to be a nesticle for six days those might have been
the best six days of your life but now it's time to be

862
01:33:24,790 --> 01:33:39,590
renamed okay now now it's time to be renamed everyone had
six days to had six days to be whatever the they are to me

863
01:33:39,590 --> 01:33:55,290
oh my god i love i love how like i could have just said
dragoons in the very beginning but i made you guys that's

864
01:33:55,290 --> 01:34:05,690
typical dokey versions i made you guys fight amongst
yourselves for like six plus days deciding a new fan name

865
01:34:05,690 --> 01:34:11,990
for yourself And then I'm like, JK, Dragoon's an actual
word.

866
01:34:12,350 --> 01:34:12,690
Like,

867
01:34:19,350 --> 01:34:30,070
I strung you along for six days yelling at each other,
trying to figure out what your new name was going to be.

868
01:34:30,750 --> 01:34:32,250
But don't worry, guys.

869
01:34:33,010 --> 01:34:34,950
Dragoons can evolve.

870
01:34:36,950 --> 01:34:48,750
all dinosaurs eventually evolved into birds which is you
know it was like we wrote three pages of

871
01:34:52,330 --> 01:35:01,770
names i like how somebody was like i was like dokey we
worked so hard coming up with all these days

872
01:35:06,930 --> 01:35:13,510
We worked so hard coming up with all of these names, Doki.

873
01:35:18,470 --> 01:35:20,290
I can't believe it.

874
01:35:20,390 --> 01:35:22,870
All right, I'll do one more poll for you guys.

875
01:35:23,650 --> 01:35:26,750
I'll do one more poll for you guys.

876
01:35:26,970 --> 01:35:33,470
Because obviously, we'll have the two finalists fight each
other for, like, the true winner.

877
01:35:33,790 --> 01:35:34,950
The true winner.

878
01:35:37,410 --> 01:35:56,090
naming ceremony naming ceremony all right dragoons versus
suspects we just all evolved you know we just we're just

879
01:35:56,090 --> 01:36:07,990
evolving the closest ancestor to the dynos if you guys
didn't know our birds is just the And we're just evolving,

880
01:36:08,150 --> 01:36:08,550
everyone.

881
01:36:08,850 --> 01:36:10,070
We're just evolving.

882
01:36:11,730 --> 01:36:15,470
Enough years have passed by for evolution to take in its
effect.

883
01:36:21,560 --> 01:36:22,400
All right, here we go.

884
01:36:22,560 --> 01:36:25,800
Give us a fact that I refuse to vote.

885
01:36:26,300 --> 01:36:29,000
I will only vote if it's nesticles.

886
01:36:29,380 --> 01:36:32,060
Well, then, he's got to be...

887
01:36:32,060 --> 01:36:34,480
Well, thank God for that.

888
01:36:34,740 --> 01:36:37,060
Thank God we vetoed nesticles.

889
01:36:39,480 --> 01:36:40,560
Oh, this is really...

890
01:36:40,580 --> 01:36:51,260
really close though this is actually really really close
when you close your eyes does it always feel like nothing

891
01:36:51,260 --> 01:37:02,400
has changed oh my god that's actually a lot closer a lot
closer than I expected I know like you guys would be like

892
01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:09,880
but Doki didn't you say didn't you say you don't want to
have Goon as the as the last part because of because of what

893
01:37:09,880 --> 01:37:19,540
they did to goons Dragoons would be like my only exception
to be fair Like I don't think I could ever adopt a new name

894
01:37:19,540 --> 01:37:28,220
with goon in it But I just have a particular attachment to
dragoons that it will be my only exception If it wins the

895
01:37:28,220 --> 01:37:43,440
poll If we win If it wins book because then it'll be
confusing that's the rule it'll be way too confusing if

896
01:37:43,440 --> 01:37:54,880
there's two names i can i guess like for suspects because i
still want four different forms so like chonky peck chonky

897
01:37:54,880 --> 01:38:01,660
sus oh my god how would be how do we say it would be chonky

Chonky specks.

Chonky specks.

01:38:08,700 --> 01:38:09,600
Long specks.

Egg specks.

905
01:38:21,140 --> 01:38:24,440
You're the only... Yeah, but like, you know, we're gonna
have four forums.

906
01:38:24,860 --> 01:38:31,760
I... There was this one design that... Like, some people
were submitting designs, and there was one design that I

907
01:38:31,760 --> 01:38:34,580
would really liked that gave me some ideas.

908
01:38:34,720 --> 01:38:36,280
And, like, why I was, like, thinking maybe...

909
01:38:36,300 --> 01:38:48,960
we if dragoons wins um there's like this idea on how to like
this idea i wanted to do uh sus goons

911
01:39:10,120 --> 01:39:13,220

you know?

912
01:39:13,580 --> 01:39:27,080
And then Long peck Egg peck That's a word Is it like People
are now voting for for track goods Because like, no,

913
01:39:27,120 --> 01:39:30,880

914
01:39:34,380 --> 01:39:39,240
Suss goons, please, I want to be a dragoon here.

915
01:39:41,180 --> 01:39:42,060
Where is...

916
01:39:42,060 --> 01:39:43,160
There's no free bird!

917
01:39:44,100 --> 01:39:47,380
They lost their voting power after the first stream.

918
01:39:49,760 --> 01:39:52,060
Doki bros, because every time we see...

919
01:39:53,780 --> 01:39:54,440
Alright.

920
01:39:58,320 --> 01:40:08,530
Oh my god, okay, so like, I forgot to tell you guys this
story, But, like, when I was playing Apex, so, like,

921
01:40:08,710 --> 01:40:11,470
obviously, I've been playing Apex a lot during that one
month.

922
01:40:11,830 --> 01:40:14,050
But, like, one of them was...

923
01:40:17,210 --> 01:40:18,090
That's so...

924
01:40:20,470 --> 01:40:20,910
Okay.

925
01:40:22,030 --> 01:40:23,150
Oh, wait, never mind.

926
01:40:23,270 --> 01:40:24,370
I can't say it.

927
01:40:24,430 --> 01:40:26,450
I can't say it.

928
01:40:27,090 --> 01:40:27,850
God, sorry.

929
01:40:27,990 --> 01:40:33,430
I'm gonna, like, you're just gonna be, like, you're gonna
get blueballed for the rest of the stream because I'll never

930
01:40:33,430 --> 01:40:33,510
see.

931
01:40:33,530 --> 01:40:34,590
say what it was.

932
01:40:39,810 --> 01:40:41,710
I guess you'll never know the story.

933
01:40:42,270 --> 01:40:46,710
You'll never know something funny happened, but you'll never
know the story.

934
01:40:47,330 --> 01:40:48,370
Very unfortunate.

935
01:40:49,050 --> 01:40:50,570
Very unfortunate.

936
01:40:51,850 --> 01:40:54,670
All right, I'm gonna give you guys one more minute.

937
01:40:55,210 --> 01:41:02,370
Suspects rise up if you want to defeat the old and bring in
a new generation.

938
01:41:03,530 --> 01:41:16,810
dynasty you'll overthrow overthrow the old and bring in your
new dynasty suspects are you strong enough suspects to kick

939
01:41:16,810 --> 01:41:32,670
those boomers out yeah suspects installed the bots new name
for the new year suspects rallied the undecided voters this

940
01:41:32,670 --> 01:41:36,990
is it Rally the undecided voters.

941
01:41:40,510 --> 01:41:49,270
If you want to win, you have to rally up and kick those old
boomers out of office.

942
01:41:50,350 --> 01:41:53,610
They would have lost a nesticle.

943
01:41:55,110 --> 01:41:58,230
You know, honestly, like 100%.

944
01:41:58,230 --> 01:42:03,430
If nesticles was in there, I would 100% agree that...

945
01:42:03,530 --> 01:42:06,670
That they would have one-offer dragoons.

946
01:42:07,310 --> 01:42:07,990
Come on!

947
01:42:08,730 --> 01:42:09,370
Suspects!

948
01:42:09,370 --> 01:42:10,170
You're young?

949
01:42:10,570 --> 01:42:11,930
There's more of you?

950
01:42:12,470 --> 01:42:20,270
You really gotta let a bunch of old dragoons out there take
away what you believe in?

951
01:42:22,070 --> 01:42:23,130
Come on!

952
01:42:24,870 --> 01:42:26,950
How long are you gonna make us dance?

953
01:42:27,190 --> 01:42:29,930
I just wanna see if I can get a 50-50 right now.

954
01:42:34,450 --> 01:42:36,370
Come on, Dragoons.

955
01:42:36,590 --> 01:42:37,790
Hold the line.

956
01:42:38,450 --> 01:42:41,570
Don't let those youngins take our office.

957
01:42:43,130 --> 01:42:45,530
Dragoons will be in office forever.

958
01:42:48,930 --> 01:42:51,570
Suspects rally up the other ones.

959
01:42:52,030 --> 01:42:54,670
Rally the nesticles to vote for you.

960
01:42:54,890 --> 01:42:57,190
Oh my god, wait, suspects are actually winning.

961
01:42:57,450 --> 01:42:57,910
Holy fuck.

962
01:42:58,290 --> 01:42:59,930
I didn't expect that to happen.

963
01:43:00,250 --> 01:43:02,210
I didn't expect that.

964
01:43:03,530 --> 01:43:18,190
this move guys come on with new year new us if doki can
change their names we can too doki dragoons really you're

965
01:43:18,190 --> 01:43:29,290
gonna let a bunch of like young young birds tell you what to
do come on you're a military unit you're really gonna let

966
01:43:29,290 --> 01:43:35,530
birds tell you what to do fucking eat birds like

967
01:43:39,950 --> 01:43:54,310
new era suspects come on dragons today we reclaim our legacy
if it's 50 50 we should pick nesticles alright nesticles is

968
01:43:54,310 --> 01:44:03,290
like the third party that has like only one person in office
and even then they can't really do much it's like it's like

969
01:44:03,530 --> 01:44:11,790
50 it's it's like suspects versus dragoons have like
majority of the seats and then nesticles is that one guy

970
01:44:11,790 --> 01:44:22,050
like the one the one person in there that has a power there
where their boats don't really count but they're there

971
01:44:22,050 --> 01:44:34,250
they're in the office push the 50 50 all right suspects i
feel like i gave you guys like so much time to like fight

972
01:44:34,250 --> 01:44:48,730
for what you believe in but like just like the real world
boomers are always in charge so suspects i feel like this is

973
01:44:48,730 --> 01:44:59,910
a harsh lesson of reality of what the real world is like
where even though you have a cool new idea no matter what in

974
01:44:59,910 --> 01:45:03,030
the end the boomers always win because they

975
01:45:07,570 --> 01:45:15,990
They'll be 90 years old and still in office and you can't do
a damn thing about it.

976
01:45:18,290 --> 01:45:30,330
So like as a young one, as a little baby suspect, as a
little baby suspect, watching an anime girl show you the

977
01:45:30,330 --> 01:45:34,970
harsh reality and give you a simulation of what that was
like.

978
01:45:34,990 --> 01:45:36,370
in the real world.

979
01:45:37,590 --> 01:45:39,850
I reject change.

980
01:45:40,330 --> 01:45:42,670
Thank you for the magenta soup, Alan.

981
01:45:42,890 --> 01:45:43,210
Thank you.

982
01:45:43,550 --> 01:45:43,910
Thank you.

983
01:45:44,350 --> 01:45:48,590
Like I say, Alan is one of those old goons.

984
01:45:49,610 --> 01:45:50,330
He...

985
01:45:52,610 --> 01:45:58,350
You have to overthrow goons like that to get what you want.

986
01:46:00,070 --> 01:46:03,430
Can we be suspects on April Fool's?

987
01:46:06,810 --> 01:46:09,230
Anyway, I'm sorry, I suspect.

988
01:46:09,530 --> 01:46:14,810
I gave you enough time to try and overthrow the old power.

989
01:46:15,490 --> 01:46:21,910
But it seems like the dragoons have evolved.

990
01:46:22,830 --> 01:46:23,810
And kept...

991
01:46:25,150 --> 01:46:27,030
There's birds now.

992
01:46:27,350 --> 01:46:34,430
There was a 10 minute...

993
01:46:34,430 --> 01:46:38,090
I gave you guys 10 minutes to fight for what you believe in.

994
01:46:38,470 --> 01:46:47,310
And if you can't fucking fight for what you believe in
within 10 minutes of me giving you extra time to rally for

995
01:46:47,310 --> 01:46:49,650
it, that's not on me.

996
01:46:53,390 --> 01:46:55,970
That's just reality at that point.

997
01:46:57,130 --> 01:47:03,290
Because in the real world, you'll have like almost a whole
year to figure this shit out.

998
01:47:04,430 --> 01:47:14,710
a year but you have multiple years to try and not let the
old people win but in the end not even just in like in like

999
01:47:14,710 --> 01:47:26,470
I guess like policies wise it's also like business wise too
that's why you need to overthrow any CEO that's 80 years old

1000
01:47:31,210 --> 01:47:40,910
I'm talking about you CEO's name I don't remember who
literally are who's literally like fucking deleting movies

1001
01:47:40,910 --> 01:47:49,910
for tax reasons like what the fuck okay I know I talked
about it yesterday but I have to talk about this again like

1002
01:47:49,910 --> 01:47:59,870
this this guy the CEO of like Warner Brothers fucking
deleted Wally Coyote for a tax break and like other studios

1003
01:47:59,870 --> 01:48:13,390
offered money and he's like no not enough like what the fuck
like other studios are like hey i'm willing to buy your your

1004
01:48:13,390 --> 01:48:20,890
movie and like no but it's basically like coyote versus acne
and it's like this like mockument i think it's like a

1005
01:48:20,890 --> 01:48:31,610
mockumentary style thing about uh wally coyote trying to
like uh in a court case against acne ink and like and like

1006
01:48:31,610 --> 01:48:40,570
apparently the test screenings was actually really nice
really did really well received um but like uh water

1007
01:48:40,570 --> 01:48:49,470
brothers ceo was like we need more tax breaks because we're
losing money and i'm just like what

1008
01:48:57,530 --> 01:49:06,110
those poor actors and those poor those poor actors and like
the the production company they leaked the production

1009
01:49:06,110 --> 01:49:17,690
company video of um the production company video they like
leaked the uh i guess like the cast party like the behind

1010
01:49:17,690 --> 01:49:26,650
the scenes of everything so you could even see like all the
set designs and everything that was built uh of all the

1011
01:49:26,650 --> 01:49:33,310
stuff that was built for it and it looks like so much time
and effort was built anyway anyway sorry i need to get that

1012
01:49:33,310 --> 01:49:39,770
out of my chest because i still can't believe they fucking
shelved that movie anyway uh happy lunar new year

1013
01:49:39,770 --> 01:49:50,550
congratulations you've been named it's sad that suspects
couldn't win the poll there it's sad let's say put another

1014
01:49:50,550 --> 01:50:04,470

concept art of your okay fuck you guys we're not gonna be

1019
01:50:58,070 --> 01:51:10,370
so like they they did this um concept design for for you
guys and that's what got me an idea of maybe perhaps uh we

1020
01:51:10,370 --> 01:51:19,510
keep we stay with dragoons also joe thank you for the 50
give the shins thank you thank you um oh shit what the fuck

1021
01:51:19,510 --> 01:51:26,890
okay um there was like something that came on my screen and
i thought it was showed up on stream as well like my drawing

1022
01:51:26,890 --> 01:51:31,590
program But then I was like, oh no, that just wasn't like on
the...

1023
01:51:31,590 --> 01:51:34,130
That was just covering up my YouTube preview.

1024
01:51:34,330 --> 01:51:36,150
So it looks like it was on screen.

1025
01:51:39,390 --> 01:51:41,450
So let me show you guys this picture.

1026
01:51:41,950 --> 01:51:44,930
So I really liked this concept.

1027
01:51:45,390 --> 01:51:49,170
But obviously I'm going to tweak it a little bit to make it
work more.

1028
01:51:49,630 --> 01:51:50,630
But I'll show you guys here.

1029
01:51:52,070 --> 01:51:52,590
Alright.

1030
01:51:53,090 --> 01:51:54,850
So now we're here.

1031
01:51:54,970 --> 01:51:56,990
I love how it says like subgold top donation.

1032
01:51:58,210 --> 01:52:10,110
sorry that was like twitch meta and all my overlays i'm
using are like old twitch stuff so so that's why it's like

1033
01:52:10,110 --> 01:52:17,750
what the fuck why is there that stuff so wait let me show
you guys so this is the reason why i thought about it

1034
01:52:17,750 --> 01:52:29,450
thought about uh because i really i liked how oops sorry i
liked how it was like um it felt like the dragoon was

1035
01:52:29,450 --> 01:52:41,690
evolving you know this it looked like an evolution of a drag
we're not gonna be called nesticas i was humoring you

1036
01:52:47,250 --> 01:52:55,370
so i is gonna i want to take like certain we're not gonna
have cheek dots too we're not we're not gonna have cheek

1037
01:52:55,370 --> 01:53:17,990
dots i told you we're not devolving we're evolving okay we
are we are evolving okay guys so so that's why i really

1038
01:53:17,990 --> 01:53:27,350
enjoyed this concept and that's what got me thinking because
into her birds so i liked how like it's like a semi

1039
01:53:27,350 --> 01:53:37,630
evolution of of like a dinosaur and i thought that was a
really neat concept and then the fact that it has like you

1040
01:53:37,630 --> 01:53:45,250
know i guess like what i say the long long goon the chunky
goon and then i don't know which one's the chunky goon not

1041
01:53:45,250 --> 01:53:55,650
to be fair i don't hate my little nesticles donkey don't
understand it rolls off your tongue nesticles we're not

1042
01:53:55,650 --> 01:54:07,230
going to be nesticles thank you for the akasupa poncho thank
you thank you I love democracy

1043
01:54:10,570 --> 01:54:17,390
all right all right so that's what I was thinking so like I
was thinking of like I'm trying to like think of like the

1044
01:54:17,390 --> 01:54:27,510
default base design because I do think like that's really

1045
01:54:27,510 --> 01:54:35,130

like this the but then it went up because i don't know your

1046
01:54:35,130 --> 01:54:52,780
fucking head evolved fucking weirdly i guess so like instead
of the side it went up so it's it fucking went up um uh what

1047
01:54:52,780 --> 01:54:53,160
thank you for

1048
01:54:56,920 --> 01:54:57,400
Satisfiness.

1049
01:54:58,080 --> 01:54:59,060
What do you say?

1050
01:54:59,360 --> 01:55:02,000
I supered my first ever super to you a while back.

1051
01:55:02,240 --> 01:55:04,360
This is my first Akasupa ever.

1052
01:55:04,960 --> 01:55:07,880
What a perfect day to give you a red, red tangle with my...

1053
01:55:07,880 --> 01:55:09,760
Thank you, thank you for the Akasupa.

1054
01:55:10,100 --> 01:55:11,460
Thank you, thank you.

1055
01:55:12,640 --> 01:55:13,120
I...

1056
01:55:13,120 --> 01:55:14,380
This was not enough, guys.

1057
01:55:14,540 --> 01:55:15,600
It was not official.

1058
01:55:16,060 --> 01:55:18,780
I said I will humor you guys.

1059
01:55:23,980 --> 01:55:24,940
I don't...

1060
01:55:25,660 --> 01:55:34,400
did say it was out of humor and i like how you know there's
like still horns and stuff too but i don't know if like i'm

1061
01:55:34,400 --> 01:55:41,900
trying to figure out like the proportion wise we're like a
normal goon so i don't know if i should like you guys should

1062
01:55:41,900 --> 01:55:55,640
have a body or you guys just be all head like i can't tell i
i can't tell if i want you guys to be all ahead or or like

1063
01:55:55,660 --> 01:55:57,720
Or like have a body of...

1064
01:55:57,720 --> 01:55:59,720
Kazen, what would the Chonky-goon look like?

1065
01:56:00,040 --> 01:56:02,880
What would the Chonky-goon look like if it's like...

1066
01:56:02,880 --> 01:56:04,400
If you guys...

1067
01:56:04,400 --> 01:56:05,710
If it's all head...

1068
01:56:07,200 --> 01:56:08,440
Or the...

1069
01:56:10,280 --> 01:56:12,260
One year nest it goes...

1070
01:56:12,260 --> 01:56:13,060
No, Kazen!

1071
01:56:13,440 --> 01:56:19,660
Kazen, it'll be confusing if I change the fan name a year
after all head.

1072
01:56:20,140 --> 01:56:20,940
No way.

1073
01:56:22,820 --> 01:56:25,520
So you want to make it look like...

1074
01:56:25,660 --> 01:56:29,780
The thing is, I was, like, wondering how to, like,
distinguish you guys, too.

1075
01:56:30,340 --> 01:56:30,700
You know?

1076
01:56:31,140 --> 01:56:32,460
So, like, there's the tail.

1077
01:56:37,970 --> 01:56:38,590
Like that.

1078
01:56:38,730 --> 01:56:39,330
And then...

1079
01:56:40,850 --> 01:56:41,650
And then...

1080
01:56:43,350 --> 01:56:43,750
There.

1081
01:56:43,950 --> 01:56:45,330
It's just...

1082
01:56:48,830 --> 01:56:50,770
It's like a fucking tomato.

1083
01:56:56,910 --> 01:56:57,710
Oh, yeah.

1084
01:56:57,830 --> 01:56:59,310
I don't know if you guys should have wings.

1085
01:56:59,330 --> 01:57:00,330
I don't know.

1086
01:57:00,410 --> 01:57:00,950
I don't know.

1087
01:57:01,050 --> 01:57:02,970
You guys should have wings or not.

1088
01:57:03,990 --> 01:57:05,870
Looking pretty nesticle here.

1089
01:57:06,630 --> 01:57:07,610
I don't know, guys.

1090
01:57:07,770 --> 01:57:09,430
I don't know if you guys deserve wings.

1091
01:57:11,030 --> 01:57:11,510
You guys haven't.

1092
01:57:11,610 --> 01:57:14,330
I feel like you guys just haven't evolved into wings yet.

1093
01:57:14,710 --> 01:57:22,750
Like, I want to edit this a little bit, though.

1094
01:57:24,210 --> 01:57:28,750
Okay, so if it has wings, you guys would look like...

1095
01:57:29,330 --> 01:57:31,330
You guys would look like...

1096
01:57:32,050 --> 01:57:34,190
Like, basically like a raptor.

1097
01:57:34,490 --> 01:57:36,710
Like, the original concept was like that.

1098
01:57:37,010 --> 01:57:40,830
But I feel like it would be cuter if you just have, like...

1099
01:57:42,550 --> 01:57:44,330
Like, if it's just...

1100
01:57:44,330 --> 01:57:46,210
There's a potato arm.

1101
01:57:50,390 --> 01:57:52,750
It'll be... It'll look very stupid.

1102
01:57:53,030 --> 01:57:55,270
We need small wings.

1103
01:57:55,610 --> 01:57:56,910
So you want to look like this?

1104
01:57:59,830 --> 01:58:03,730
I don't think I want, like, the bows and stuff, though.

1105
01:58:04,050 --> 01:58:09,490
I was, like, thinking, like, you'll still keep number.

1106
01:58:10,210 --> 01:58:13,850
I've always liked that concept, but I don't think we can do
that.

1107
01:58:14,170 --> 01:58:16,170
I don't think we can do that.

1108
01:58:17,190 --> 01:58:18,590
Let us fly.

1109
01:58:19,210 --> 01:58:20,710
Okay, we'll let you fly.

1110
01:58:22,990 --> 01:58:23,470
And

1111
01:58:31,560 --> 01:58:32,040
then...

1112
01:58:32,040 --> 01:58:35,200
All right, so it'll be like, boom, boom, boom.

1113
01:58:37,420 --> 01:58:41,420
I don't know, I'm just like thinking like, uh...

1114
01:58:41,960 --> 01:58:45,740
Like, what is a way to...

1115
01:58:45,740 --> 01:58:49,680
What is like a way to differentiate all of you?

1116
01:58:50,760 --> 01:58:52,780
We obviously can't put a number anymore.

1117
01:58:57,480 --> 01:58:59,160
Arms and wings?

1118
01:58:59,720 --> 01:59:01,760
Guys, now you're demanding.

1119
01:59:04,080 --> 01:59:06,040
We should be flightless.

1120
01:59:06,040 --> 01:59:16,760
Okay, all right, we're gonna have a pull No either wings or
no wings Either Either you guys have no wings And you're

1121
01:59:16,760 --> 01:59:25,260
like this Or oh my god Wings Or no wings

1122
01:59:29,580 --> 01:59:37,500
Wings Arms or no arms The arms would be like that But then
wings I feel like arms would be better Arms would be so

1123
01:59:37,500 --> 01:59:50,900
funny I like how somebody was like I don't know who it was
but like please I don't want to be a bird so this is like

1124
01:59:50,900 --> 02:00:02,020
the next best thing we're not gonna have cheek dots I know
you guys really want I mean it does look really cute though

1125
02:00:02,020 --> 02:00:08,280
it does look really cute though the the bone lizard bone

1126
02:00:13,200 --> 02:00:20,480
oh okay wait give me a sec let me if let me check this out
real fast let me see what it looks like

1127
02:00:25,350 --> 02:00:39,750
let me see what it looks like without cheek dots let's see
oh no i'm trying to think right now i'm trying to think i

1128
02:00:39,750 --> 02:00:48,110
feel like i feel like uh give us those we deserve it

1129
02:00:53,410 --> 02:01:00,990
i'm trying to think i'm trying to think if you guys deserve
to have cheek dots or not bone in or bone out no cheek dots

1130
02:01:00,990 --> 02:01:03,530
dot cheeks will rise again

1131
02:01:06,890 --> 02:01:15,330
i see like no cheek dots is better just because like Just
because I think it's cuter about it.

1132
02:01:19,960 --> 02:01:21,400
I feel like...

1133
02:01:21,400 --> 02:01:24,460
I feel like it's just cuter without it, though.

1134
02:01:27,850 --> 02:01:28,690
Pull, please?

1135
02:01:28,970 --> 02:01:29,230
Okay.

1136
02:01:30,130 --> 02:01:30,670
Maybe...

1137
02:01:30,670 --> 02:01:32,390
The cheek dots for me.

1138
02:01:32,830 --> 02:01:34,830
I don't want to be cute.

1139
02:01:39,210 --> 02:01:39,850
I...

1140
02:01:39,850 --> 02:01:42,430
Sorry, that one guy does not want cheek dots.

1141
02:01:42,470 --> 02:01:45,170
He does not want to be cute, guys.

1142
02:01:45,490 --> 02:01:46,890
He doesn't want...

1143
02:01:46,910 --> 02:01:48,510
to be cute

1144
02:01:51,630 --> 02:02:12,490
it's like a real man doesn't have dogs it is okay okay
anyway um I want to be cute though I want to be cute fuck

1145
02:02:12,490 --> 02:02:22,470
that guy I think like merchant like plush was I think think
it's easier to i think it's it's better for them to not have

1146
02:02:22,470 --> 02:02:33,750
cheek dots because like plush wise um i personally think
plush wise no cheek dots look better um versus like i like

1147
02:02:33,750 --> 02:02:43,550
when you look at stuff like uh in real life because it's
hard to make cheek dots work on a plush I don't know, I

1148
02:02:43,550 --> 02:02:45,030
don't know, but...

1149
02:02:45,550 --> 02:02:46,970
No, give it back!

1150
02:02:49,150 --> 02:02:49,750
Alright.

1151
02:02:51,150 --> 02:02:53,450
Alright, and to make things easier...

1152
02:02:53,450 --> 02:02:54,290
Ooh, okay.

1153
02:02:55,090 --> 02:02:55,450
Me.

1154
02:02:55,910 --> 02:02:59,950
I hope it's okay if I edit the artwork a little bit just to
help me get an idea.

1155
02:03:00,770 --> 02:03:02,070
Alright, let's see.

1156
02:03:02,270 --> 02:03:04,030
And to help it...

1157
02:03:04,730 --> 02:03:07,450
Sinking, maybe like...

1158
02:03:10,640 --> 02:03:11,860
Like this.

1159
02:03:15,220 --> 02:03:37,470
maybe like a belly a white belly you want what white belly
or no let's see the white belly would be look like this for

1160
02:03:37,470 --> 02:03:40,790
the white belly like

1161
02:03:44,940 --> 02:03:55,060
that it's not just all yellow at that point like there's
more colors to it hat no what the fuck this is my hat find

1162
02:03:55,060 --> 02:03:56,060
your own hat

1163
02:04:00,420 --> 02:04:12,220
what the fuck find your own hat you're not gonna have hats
you're like team fortress gives you hats yeah they're

1164
02:04:12,220 --> 02:04:14,480
fucking go Oshi team fortress too

1165
02:04:17,520 --> 02:04:25,460
okay alright I have an idea alright this is a default form
right here this is going to be default guy.

1166
02:04:26,120 --> 02:04:31,520
And then Long Goon would be like

1167
02:04:34,970 --> 02:04:36,750
this is Long Goon

1168
02:04:40,180 --> 02:04:41,800
just like that.

1169
02:04:42,200 --> 02:04:44,060
Long Goon has evolved to

1170
02:04:50,020 --> 02:04:54,900
he's like a little how the fuck do I do like the shape?

1171
02:05:08,260 --> 02:05:09,960
And then Long Goon Long Goon

1172
02:05:18,880 --> 02:05:21,680
I'm sorry

chunky goon is just it's just no legs it's just

1178
02:06:46,600 --> 02:06:58,460

1184
02:08:12,320 --> 02:08:13,360
I can't tell.

1185
02:08:14,860 --> 02:08:16,280
The missing link.

1186
02:08:16,840 --> 02:08:18,520
The missing link.

1187
02:08:20,020 --> 02:08:22,400
I can't tell if we should have this.

1188
02:08:23,420 --> 02:08:24,060
Or...

1189
02:08:24,060 --> 02:08:25,740
Wait, what if this is the normal form?

1190
02:08:25,900 --> 02:08:27,280
We could have this as the normal.

1191
02:08:27,380 --> 02:08:28,380
I can't tell.

1192
02:08:29,140 --> 02:08:29,740
That's...

1193
02:08:29,740 --> 02:08:30,580
Make that...

1194
02:08:30,580 --> 02:08:31,640
Yeah, this...

1195
02:08:31,640 --> 02:08:33,060
What is the face?

1196
02:08:33,640 --> 02:08:34,580
This should...

1197
02:08:37,140 --> 02:08:38,420
I don't...

1198
02:08:38,420 --> 02:08:39,040
I don't...

1199
02:08:39,400 --> 02:08:41,840
This is the base design.

1200
02:08:42,580 --> 02:08:43,940
I can't tell.

1201
02:08:44,180 --> 02:08:45,340
It's so good.

1202
02:08:46,660 --> 02:08:47,320
The stick.

1203
02:08:47,440 --> 02:08:48,640
The stick legs.

1204
02:08:49,680 --> 02:08:51,080
Or just all head.

1205
02:08:51,860 --> 02:08:53,380
It just goes back.

1206
02:08:53,920 --> 02:08:56,320
The twig legs are so good though.

1207
02:08:58,360 --> 02:08:58,700
Oh yeah.

1208
02:08:58,740 --> 02:09:00,300
I forgot the horns for each too.

1209
02:09:00,740 --> 02:09:00,880
No.

1210
02:09:01,060 --> 02:09:02,420
The longu didn't have horns.

1211
02:09:02,560 --> 02:09:04,000
Longu never had horns.

1212
02:09:04,980 --> 02:09:05,540
It was.

1213
02:09:06,280 --> 02:09:06,920
Only.

1214
02:09:07,320 --> 02:09:07,720
Uh.

1215
02:09:10,260 --> 02:09:13,180
It's ticklings with no heart.

1216
02:09:13,780 --> 02:09:16,200
We're never gonna win wars.

1217
02:09:18,380 --> 02:09:19,280
I can't tell.

1218
02:09:19,420 --> 02:09:21,450
I can't tell if I want you guys to...

1219
02:09:22,040 --> 02:09:24,900
I don't know if I want you guys to be all head.

1220
02:09:25,480 --> 02:09:28,280
Or like with the little legs.

1221
02:09:28,520 --> 02:09:29,840
Because it's so funny.

1222
02:09:30,200 --> 02:09:31,820
It's so funny.

1223
02:09:33,220 --> 02:09:33,540
Bro.

1224
02:09:33,800 --> 02:09:36,380
Buff legs to help hold up the chunk.

1225
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:37,560
It's like...

1226
02:09:37,560 --> 02:09:38,360
It's like...

1227
02:09:38,360 --> 02:09:39,380
I stand up.

1228
02:09:39,400 --> 02:09:48,160
up it's like you know like those memes or it's like oh he's
he's so fucking weak and then and he gets out it's like what

1229
02:09:48,160 --> 02:09:57,620
do you say what do you say like he's not gonna catch me he
has no legs and then he just stands up and is like say it to

1230
02:09:57,620 --> 02:10:09,760
my face they look like nesticles how would the plush work
It's like a tiny line.

1231
02:10:09,980 --> 02:10:11,300
It's like a tiny...

1232
02:10:11,300 --> 02:10:12,060
Legs are...

1233
02:10:12,060 --> 02:10:13,180
Okay, okay, okay.

1234
02:10:13,840 --> 02:10:14,020
Alright.

1235
02:10:15,120 --> 02:10:16,180
Chonky goons.

1236
02:10:16,680 --> 02:10:22,180
You have a secret power where, like, your legs are
retractable.

1237
02:10:22,780 --> 02:10:23,040
Okay.

1238
02:10:23,260 --> 02:10:24,560
What is this?

1239
02:10:28,920 --> 02:10:30,540
Okay, not gonna lie.

1240
02:10:30,780 --> 02:10:33,600
I sort of want this to be the base form now.

1241
02:10:33,740 --> 02:10:34,580
Wait, I can't...

1242
02:10:34,580 --> 02:10:37,960
I feel like this as the base form is so good.

1243
02:10:38,300 --> 02:10:39,500
It is so good.

1244
02:10:39,520 --> 02:10:55,340
good guys I feel like this should be the original for I just
think I think this should guys I'm sorry I'm sorry for this

1245
02:10:55,340 --> 02:11:06,100
guy but this guy is so funny okay this This is going to be
the original.

1246
02:11:06,960 --> 02:11:07,820
The original.

1247
02:11:12,900 --> 02:11:14,140
Oh my god.

1248
02:11:15,040 --> 02:11:15,360
Oh.

1249
02:11:16,060 --> 02:11:17,280
I don't even think you...

1250
02:11:17,280 --> 02:11:17,900
You know what?

1251
02:11:18,060 --> 02:11:19,320
You guys don't need horns.

1252
02:11:19,500 --> 02:11:21,660
I feel like no horns is fine.

1253
02:11:22,140 --> 02:11:23,200
You just got a tail.

1254
02:11:23,800 --> 02:11:24,960
You just got a tail.

1255
02:11:30,040 --> 02:11:31,740
I feel like...

1256
02:11:31,740 --> 02:11:32,380
I don't know.

1257
02:11:32,520 --> 02:11:33,400
Looking at it.

1258
02:11:33,420 --> 02:11:36,600
I think it just looks so good like this.

1259
02:11:36,980 --> 02:11:40,220
It's just so bring back my leg, boy.

1260
02:11:41,040 --> 02:11:41,380
Alright.

1261
02:11:42,920 --> 02:11:43,360
Alright.

1262
02:11:43,840 --> 02:11:47,180
Here is the Longoon.

1263
02:11:48,380 --> 02:11:50,820
Longoon, you have real legs.

1264
02:11:50,980 --> 02:11:52,520
You have real legs.

1265
02:11:53,100 --> 02:11:57,080
And then, honestly, I like the first one.

1266
02:11:57,360 --> 02:12:00,280
Alright, how about we make that one the Chonkun's?

1267
02:12:00,340 --> 02:12:02,840
Oh, but this one is the Chonkun X-Mercet.

1268
02:12:06,920 --> 02:12:19,480
oh my god that's why he has legs okay chonkun's base form no
horns because you guys evolved out of the horns so this is

1269
02:12:19,480 --> 02:12:31,520
the base we're gonna redo all this this is this is base form
chonk long

1270
02:12:35,340 --> 02:12:51,440
this is the evil level one versus um and then um so you can
draw the base form with no legs if you want this can so you

1271
02:12:51,440 --> 02:13:01,920
can draw a base with no legs or arms so base form has no
horns he has no horns he he has evolved out of horns just

1272
02:13:01,920 --> 02:13:04,840
like the long one Just like the long boy.

1273
02:13:06,240 --> 02:13:06,420
Chonk.

1274
02:13:06,560 --> 02:13:07,540
The chonk one.

1275
02:13:08,040 --> 02:13:09,120
The chonky guy.

1276
02:13:09,580 --> 02:13:11,900
He's still going through evolution right now.

1277
02:13:12,020 --> 02:13:14,300
He's still going through evolution.

1278
02:13:15,760 --> 02:13:16,480
And then.

1279
02:13:16,920 --> 02:13:17,540
And then.

1280
02:13:17,820 --> 02:13:18,340
Obviously.

1281
02:13:19,440 --> 02:13:20,400
There's the eggs.

1282
02:13:21,160 --> 02:13:22,580
Eggs still exist.

1283
02:13:24,820 --> 02:13:26,940
The eggs still exist.

1284
02:13:28,700 --> 02:13:30,640
It's just you have different legs now.

1285
02:13:33,420 --> 02:13:35,320
And now you have weak-ass legs.

1286
02:13:36,280 --> 02:13:38,700
I mean, I did you all along.

1287
02:13:39,260 --> 02:13:39,560
Alright!

1288
02:13:40,180 --> 02:13:43,060
Alright, let me draw this a little better.

1289
02:13:43,320 --> 02:13:44,860
Let me draw this.

1290
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:46,120
I just love this guy.

1291
02:13:46,880 --> 02:13:49,900
I love this guy so much.

1292
02:13:51,720 --> 02:13:53,240
Oh my god.

1293
02:13:53,680 --> 02:13:55,620
We're still the fresh eggs.

1294
02:13:56,320 --> 02:13:58,040
Oh, he's so funny.

1295
02:13:58,680 --> 02:14:00,840
He's just so fucking funny.

1296
02:14:01,500 --> 02:14:03,320
Alright, let me...

1297
02:14:03,420 --> 02:14:05,680
Let me do a better...

1298
02:14:05,680 --> 02:14:07,680
A better line art.

1299
02:14:09,180 --> 02:14:09,840
Okay.

1300
02:14:11,160 --> 02:14:11,640
Alright.

1301
02:14:17,250 --> 02:14:18,570
Let me...

1302
02:14:18,570 --> 02:14:21,170
I can't.

1303
02:14:21,270 --> 02:14:23,230
There's so little...

1304
02:14:23,230 --> 02:14:24,310
dead eyes.

1305
02:14:29,720 --> 02:14:30,960
Oh my god.

1306
02:14:31,080 --> 02:14:34,120
When he like fucking stands up and was like, what do you
say?

1307
02:14:34,780 --> 02:14:36,060
What do you say?

1308
02:14:37,980 --> 02:14:47,800
oh my god let me badden this guy up all right the death
stare i mean he can you can do different eyes you can do

1309
02:14:47,800 --> 02:14:55,060
this eye too so there's different eyes you can do the non
i'm gonna kill you

1310
02:14:58,480 --> 02:15:09,700
okay you guys have two different eyes the i'm not gonna kill
you one and then the i've seen some stuff i've seen things

1311
02:15:09,700 --> 02:15:24,460
so there's two sets of eyes i've seen things and i'm not
gonna i'm okay now and i'm okay but this will be default

1312
02:15:24,460 --> 02:15:27,020
just in case this is gonna be default

1313
02:15:33,620 --> 02:15:39,980
i just love the fucking Just lower the legs.

1314
02:15:40,800 --> 02:15:41,520
Alright, base.

1315
02:15:42,280 --> 02:15:43,160
The base one.

1316
02:15:43,300 --> 02:15:46,020
And then the giant one.

1317
02:15:47,140 --> 02:15:49,540
Or maybe this can have dot eyes.

1318
02:15:50,920 --> 02:15:52,320
No, we'll do...

1319
02:15:52,320 --> 02:15:52,600
Okay.

1320
02:15:53,360 --> 02:15:56,020
And then the giant one here.

1321
02:15:56,620 --> 02:15:58,200
The head empty inside.

1322
02:15:59,860 --> 02:16:02,480
And then here's the other one.

1323
02:16:05,080 --> 02:16:07,640
And then he's like...

1324
02:16:09,920 --> 02:16:11,080
And then

1325
02:16:14,160 --> 02:16:30,520
And let me Draw his chunky His chunky ass form He's like Big
He's a big boy He has the horns because he's taking a little

1326
02:16:30,520 --> 02:16:44,720
bit He's taking a little bit to evolve He's taking a little
bit right now sorry it's incredibly sketchy because i'm not

1327
02:16:44,720 --> 02:16:53,320
ready to really art today it's so it's a little bit very
it's very sketchy but i'm pretty sure somebody will be able

1328
02:16:53,320 --> 02:17:04,640
to draw this better than me all right but i'm giving you
guys the base design right now and then his legs his little

1329
02:17:04,640 --> 02:17:17,900
legs it here to um to tin for for doing for giving this
concept and making me go like whoa i really like you i

1330
02:17:17,900 --> 02:17:26,100
really like the concept i wonder if i should do you know and
then that's the chonky you go i feel like he should be maybe

1331
02:17:26,100 --> 02:17:30,500
like round okay

1332
02:17:33,790 --> 02:17:46,490
okay but what if what if guys He's like this big, you know?

1333
02:17:48,990 --> 02:17:50,070
He's...

1334
02:17:51,690 --> 02:17:52,770
And...

1335
02:17:55,680 --> 02:17:58,180
He's like...

1336
02:18:03,810 --> 02:18:04,350
Big...

1337
02:18:04,890 --> 02:18:08,410
Like, but like, what if he's like...

1338
02:18:08,410 --> 02:18:09,550
Huge, okay?

1339
02:18:11,050 --> 02:18:13,330
You need some run?

1340
02:18:13,810 --> 02:18:14,010
Okay.

1341
02:18:14,830 --> 02:18:16,290
I feel like I can...

1342
02:18:16,310 --> 02:18:26,150
adjust his chunkiness a little bit more give me a sec i feel
like i can adjust the chunkiness just a little bit more i

1343
02:18:26,150 --> 02:18:32,590
feel like it's possible i feel like you do make him like
more egg shape oh yes yes

1344
02:18:36,870 --> 02:18:42,710
oh yeah there you go i just needed to be i just wanted to be
wider there we go Oh, maybe it's, like, a little bit too

1345
02:18:42,710 --> 02:18:43,070
wide.

1346
02:18:43,230 --> 02:18:44,430
Let me just...

1347
02:18:44,430 --> 02:18:46,250
Maybe it's a little bit too wide.

1348
02:18:47,250 --> 02:18:47,550
There we go.

1349
02:18:49,250 --> 02:18:51,190
I think we can settle with the middle wide.

1350
02:18:51,530 --> 02:18:51,910
There we go.

1351
02:18:53,490 --> 02:18:54,830
Because he has to be chonk.

1352
02:18:55,310 --> 02:18:55,710
You know?

1353
02:18:56,190 --> 02:18:57,370
He's chonky.

1354
02:18:58,290 --> 02:18:59,410
He's a wide goon.

1355
02:19:00,230 --> 02:19:01,290
And then...

1356
02:19:01,290 --> 02:19:02,310
Long goon time.

1357
02:19:02,370 --> 02:19:04,430
Long goon has evolved away from...

1358
02:19:04,430 --> 02:19:05,370
Has always...

1359
02:19:05,370 --> 02:19:06,330
Never had horns.

1360
02:19:07,330 --> 02:19:07,850
So...

1361
02:19:07,850 --> 02:19:08,830
He's fine.

1362
02:19:13,320 --> 02:19:13,840
There are...

1363
02:19:13,860 --> 02:19:22,540
they've always been fine so and then and poop

1364
02:19:26,600 --> 02:19:44,460
yep and then there you go and then finally finally egg now
you don't have spots anymore because birds don't have spots

1365
02:19:44,460 --> 02:19:58,120
on their on their eggs i mean some birds this this bird
doesn't maybe actually I don't know no no spots because

1366
02:19:58,120 --> 02:20:12,480
you're not you're not dinosaurs anymore you're an egg it's
just it's just a white egg it's just a white egg oh cracks

1367
02:20:12,480 --> 02:20:20,460
in the no I think if you want cracks that's your own egg
that's your own egg all right so there's the base design

1368
02:20:20,460 --> 02:20:28,360
obviously you can draw the base design as just a head
because you were just born like that you could either be a

1369
02:20:28,360 --> 02:20:37,440
headless headless version or the stick when you're just
sitting down so like when you're sitting down you guys have

1370
02:20:37,440 --> 02:20:43,800
no legs you know and then it's like you retract it you like
extract it

1371
02:20:47,580 --> 02:20:53,100
but you sit down you look like this and then when I'll be
like Alright, dragons, come over here.

1372
02:20:53,180 --> 02:20:54,060
You go, like, huh?

1373
02:20:55,160 --> 02:20:56,600
You're like, huh?

1374
02:21:01,960 --> 02:21:07,800
So, so, when you're like, oh my god, Doki's calling for me.

1375
02:21:08,060 --> 02:21:12,740
Okay, normally, normally, it's like either no legs.

1376
02:21:14,060 --> 02:21:16,000
And you're just like, you're just ahead.

1377
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:18,260
This is standby mode.

1378
02:21:18,640 --> 02:21:21,500
Standby mode versus not standby mode.

1379
02:21:21,520 --> 02:21:24,840
Go go catch it Kune now.

1380
02:21:25,660 --> 02:21:25,680
Okay.

1381
02:21:26,800 --> 02:21:27,520
Stand by

1382
02:21:31,880 --> 02:21:32,560
legs.

1383
02:21:38,720 --> 02:21:46,340
So, um, so, like, that is the, that is the evolution line.

1384
02:21:46,700 --> 02:21:47,740
Energy saving mode.

1385
02:21:47,880 --> 02:21:48,240
Yeah, yeah.

1386
02:21:48,320 --> 02:21:49,560
So this is the base form.

1387
02:21:50,600 --> 02:22:01,520
This is regular regular mode of dragoons and then and then
this is chonky goon where you guys have not really evolved

1388
02:22:01,520 --> 02:22:17,480
quite so far you guys haven't really evolved so far so
you're still just a little bit a little bit behind in the

1389
02:22:17,480 --> 02:22:29,480
evolution line and then and then there's the long goons
where you're still lying and the tokey moins and then the

1390
02:22:29,480 --> 02:22:40,700
and then the iggoons are still there they're still there all
right i like this idea all right anyway anyway let's me

1391
02:22:40,700 --> 02:22:50,100
color this real quick so all right so the colors are gonna
be pretty easy it's gonna be we're not gonna have cheek dots

1392
02:22:50,100 --> 02:22:54,020
at all so it's gonna be yellow

1393
02:22:57,200 --> 02:23:00,140
here this is gonna be so fucking rough

1394
02:23:03,520 --> 02:23:19,220
i swear it looks so much better i'll do i'll like recolor
all i'll redraw this a little bit better i swear but these

1395
02:23:19,220 --> 02:23:24,080
are the colors i like the colors that this artist chose
because I think it's really cute.

1396
02:23:24,600 --> 02:23:25,840
I always like the little pastel.

1397
02:23:26,040 --> 02:23:28,240
I mean, I could make it a little bit lighter, maybe?

1398
02:23:28,880 --> 02:23:29,140
No.

1399
02:23:29,420 --> 02:23:30,980
Actually, I like this yellow.

1400
02:23:31,520 --> 02:23:32,320
And then

1401
02:23:37,160 --> 02:23:38,280
here's like...

1402
02:23:38,280 --> 02:23:41,020
I don't know if I want the little belly now.

1403
02:23:41,680 --> 02:23:44,400
I feel like it looks better with no belly.

1404
02:23:47,700 --> 02:23:48,760
Oh my god.

1405
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:53,900
But yes, like previous evolution line, you don't have to be
yellow.

1406
02:23:54,940 --> 02:23:56,500
You guys don't have to be yellow.

1407
02:23:56,620 --> 02:23:59,000
You can be different colors if you really want to.

1408
02:23:59,100 --> 02:24:02,720
So you can be a green goon.

1409
02:24:03,300 --> 02:24:04,720
But like yellow is the default.

1410
02:24:05,240 --> 02:24:06,300
No belly or belly.

1411
02:24:06,380 --> 02:24:08,600
I can't tell if I want a belly or not.

1412
02:24:09,400 --> 02:24:10,640
I can't tell yet.

1413
02:24:11,560 --> 02:24:12,080
Honestly.

1414
02:24:13,560 --> 02:24:14,360
Keep the belly.

1415
02:24:15,500 --> 02:24:17,720
But maybe we can use like white instead.

1416
02:24:18,260 --> 02:24:18,560
Maybe.

1417
02:24:19,740 --> 02:24:23,000
Maybe white would look better than the pale yellow.

1418
02:24:23,260 --> 02:24:24,460
Oh It's true, pal.

1419
02:24:26,200 --> 02:24:26,540
Maybe.

1420
02:24:29,700 --> 02:24:32,460
I don't know if I want the belly or not.

1421
02:24:33,300 --> 02:24:34,180
Can't tell yet.

1422
02:24:34,780 --> 02:24:35,580
P-H-C.

1423
02:24:36,900 --> 02:24:37,320
Uh.

1424
02:24:40,060 --> 02:24:42,420
Maybe I put the belly like this.

1425
02:24:43,220 --> 02:24:44,100
Maybe it'll look better.

1426
02:24:45,380 --> 02:24:46,220
I can't tell.

1427
02:24:47,040 --> 02:24:49,480
I can't tell if I want the belly or not.

1428
02:24:50,340 --> 02:24:50,940
Uh.

1429
02:24:54,780 --> 02:24:55,420
Uh.

1430
02:24:56,820 --> 02:24:57,900
Let's see.

1431
02:24:59,440 --> 02:25:00,480
Belly or no belly?

1432
02:25:00,840 --> 02:25:03,160
Belly or no belly?

1433
02:25:03,880 --> 02:25:04,820
So hard to pick.

1434
02:25:04,900 --> 02:25:06,440
I'm so indecisive.

1435
02:25:09,340 --> 02:25:10,460
Yes, belly?

1436
02:25:11,640 --> 02:25:12,800
Belly good?

1437
02:25:15,180 --> 02:25:17,280
Okay, we'll keep the belly.

1438
02:25:18,160 --> 02:25:21,740
Alright, if you guys think belly good, we'll keep it.

1439
02:25:23,440 --> 02:25:24,500
Let's see.

1440
02:25:26,800 --> 02:25:40,310
all right and then let me give you guys the beak and stuff
beaks are always orange just so you guys know it's always

1441
02:25:40,310 --> 02:25:42,390
orange and then

1442
02:25:46,490 --> 02:26:00,390
like yeah it looks like this there you go this looks like
fucking big bird I didn't see my last he looks like fucking

1443
02:26:00,390 --> 02:26:01,210
Big Bird.

1444
02:26:04,110 --> 02:26:05,470
Oh my god.

1445
02:26:06,090 --> 02:26:08,370
We're in Sesame Street right now.

1446
02:26:09,330 --> 02:26:11,250
Alright, so this one looks like Bellia Nobell.

1447
02:26:11,290 --> 02:26:12,330
I guess...

1448
02:26:14,010 --> 02:26:14,610
There you go.

1449
02:26:16,110 --> 02:26:18,390
Or maybe a tiny or Bellia there you go.

1450
02:26:20,810 --> 02:26:22,630
This is the official designs.

1451
02:26:23,490 --> 02:26:25,590
The official Dragoons.

1452
02:26:25,830 --> 02:26:27,230
Big Bird Evolution.

1453
02:26:28,450 --> 02:26:29,090
Okay.

1454
02:26:29,330 --> 02:26:34,950
You guys can clearly draw this a lot better than what I did.

1455
02:26:36,250 --> 02:26:38,010
My friendly neighborhood.

1456
02:26:38,630 --> 02:26:39,050
Look at that.

1457
02:26:39,130 --> 02:26:41,810
Longoon evolved into having legs.

1458
02:26:43,510 --> 02:26:44,250
Congratulations.

1459
02:26:46,010 --> 02:26:46,750
Longoon.

1460
02:26:46,910 --> 02:26:49,590
You now have legs.

1461
02:26:50,090 --> 02:26:51,470
I mean, you had, I mean, arms, sorry.

1462
02:26:51,770 --> 02:26:53,350
You now have arms.

1463
02:26:54,070 --> 02:26:54,810
Congratulations.

1464
02:26:56,070 --> 02:26:56,770
Longoon.

1465
02:26:57,270 --> 02:26:58,790
You have arms now.

1466
02:26:59,330 --> 02:27:05,510
Give a warm welcome to the official Dragoon Evolution Line.

1467
02:27:06,650 --> 02:27:10,010
This is honestly my favorite because of the liggs
activation.

1468
02:27:15,520 --> 02:27:19,760
I love the liggs activation.

1469
02:27:22,020 --> 02:27:25,000
You can grab now.

1470
02:27:26,440 --> 02:27:28,280
You can grab things.

1471
02:27:28,540 --> 02:27:29,380
Congratulations.

1472
02:27:30,660 --> 02:27:31,560
Oh my god.

1473
02:27:32,040 --> 02:27:34,720
Congratulations, I'm so proud of all of you.

1474
02:27:35,960 --> 02:27:38,940
I am incredibly proud of all of you.

1475
02:27:39,640 --> 02:27:41,800
Anyway, so...

1476
02:27:42,820 --> 02:27:43,620
Egg.

1477
02:27:44,400 --> 02:27:46,800
We all start off as eggs.

1478
02:27:48,720 --> 02:27:50,800
Then we go here.

1479
02:27:51,600 --> 02:27:56,400
And then these guys are like awkward in between cousins.

1480
02:27:57,300 --> 02:28:02,020
The awkward cousins of the bun.

1481
02:28:02,040 --> 02:28:12,020
would it be funny though if like okay this is a little dumb
but like you would think that you would think the chunky guy

1482
02:28:12,020 --> 02:28:20,340
is like the biggest one but like what if they're like what
if like the chunky guys are like this size next

1483
02:28:25,860 --> 02:28:32,040
they're chunky but small Anyway, no, I think, like, they're
all size act.

1484
02:28:32,140 --> 02:28:35,800
Actually, I feel like, maybe Chonky-goon would be like this.

1485
02:28:37,620 --> 02:28:42,160
Because, like, you know, when you're evolving, when you're
evolving, you get...

1486
02:28:42,160 --> 02:28:51,340
Okay, so, like, my logic here is, like, you know, like,
dinosaurs, they evolve smaller and smaller, but, like, the

1487
02:28:51,340 --> 02:28:54,560
Chonky-goons, you know, because they're going into...

1488
02:28:54,560 --> 02:28:56,480
They're, like, birds, right?

1489
02:28:56,700 --> 02:28:58,060
So they're still big.

1490
02:28:58,160 --> 02:29:09,900
you know they're so big so we're gonna go by that logic so
next to like next to them they're like double their size you

1491
02:29:09,900 --> 02:29:22,920
know it's just like just like evolution their chonky goons
are bigger than the base size the base goons are small maybe

1492
02:29:22,920 --> 02:29:29,820
maybe so yeah there's not much going on in the chonky goons
head just so you guys know if you guys are like i'm a chonky

1493
02:29:29,820 --> 02:29:37,660
goon lore wise there's much not there's not a lot going on
and the horns are like sort of like poking into their brains

1494
02:29:37,660 --> 02:29:44,100
right now so they're still a little bit they're they're
still they're still getting there you know they're they're

1495
02:29:44,100 --> 02:29:45,320
getting there

1496
02:29:51,320 --> 02:30:04,340
so so you know just like cavemen you know like the the
cavemen they are like like base form goon is is like the

1497
02:30:04,340 --> 02:30:21,880
2020s right now base goons are 2020s and then chonky goon is
still 500 bc so long goon is like um the future who we

1498
02:30:21,880 --> 02:30:33,980
strive to be long and have in a bit thick big thick i was
thinking if the no i feel like i think like i don't know if

1499
02:30:33,980 --> 02:30:43,100
we should have like legs for the someone was like what about
the stick legs for eggs all right let me see the stick legs

1500
02:30:43,100 --> 02:31:06,290
what would stick legs look like no no wait wait actually
wait wait okay do we give the stick legs or guys do we do we

1501
02:31:06,290 --> 02:31:26,530
give them real legs or stick legs like do we what do you
guys want the stick legs or the or real legs okay you guys

1502
02:31:26,530 --> 02:31:33,230
get stick legs because you're you're from the base for
Alright, there we go.

1503
02:31:33,470 --> 02:31:34,950
This is the evolution line.

1504
02:31:36,730 --> 02:31:37,390
We've all...

1505
02:31:37,390 --> 02:31:39,890
We've all, like, grew as...

1506
02:31:41,570 --> 02:31:42,210
grew...

1507
02:31:42,990 --> 02:31:44,730
We all grew, guys.

1508
02:31:45,510 --> 02:31:47,470
All of us have evolved.

1509
02:31:48,110 --> 02:31:49,570
We are all birds now.

1510
02:31:49,790 --> 02:31:51,570
We're all birds now.

1511
02:31:53,150 --> 02:31:55,390
Looks scuffed, but lore, I guess.

1512
02:31:58,170 --> 02:31:59,590
Alright, here we go.

1513
02:31:59,950 --> 02:32:00,710
Here's the lore.

1514
02:32:02,030 --> 02:32:03,750
You have been named.

1515
02:32:04,530 --> 02:32:11,270
You have all been officially named and given a vision of
what you all look like.

1516
02:32:11,470 --> 02:32:14,290
I hope you guys are happy with your new form.

1517
02:32:15,010 --> 02:32:17,530
I love the little signalings me too.

1518
02:32:17,870 --> 02:32:19,850
It's so fucking stupid.

1519
02:32:20,410 --> 02:32:21,570
I love it.

1520
02:32:22,610 --> 02:32:26,530
You can be any color for the birds.

1521
02:32:26,690 --> 02:32:29,570
You can be any different types of color if you want.

1522
02:32:30,310 --> 02:32:34,730
Um, But yellow is the default because I'm yellow.

1523
02:32:35,790 --> 02:32:36,690
Yellow is the default.

1524
02:32:37,390 --> 02:32:39,650
But you can see any different colors.

1525
02:32:41,770 --> 02:32:42,790
Reject evolution.

1526
02:32:43,470 --> 02:32:44,710
Remain a dinosaur.

1527
02:32:45,170 --> 02:32:47,110
Lord Kurosus, thank you for the super chat.

1528
02:32:47,370 --> 02:32:47,530
Thank you.

1529
02:32:47,910 --> 02:32:48,390
Thank you.

1530
02:32:49,450 --> 02:32:49,750
Nesticles.

1531
02:32:50,230 --> 02:32:51,070
Let's go.

1532
02:32:51,890 --> 02:32:53,710
We're not nesticles.

1533
02:32:54,170 --> 02:32:55,930
We're dragoons.

1534
02:32:56,970 --> 02:32:59,990
I mean, if you want pants, you can have pants.

1535
02:33:00,110 --> 02:33:01,550
Like, I'm not going to.

1536
02:33:01,570 --> 02:33:13,710
like I'm not going to say no you it's your vision anyway
huge shout out to tin for the concept I might be lazy and I

1537
02:33:13,710 --> 02:33:21,590
might tin if you're watching this right now I might
commission you to do the rep to make a better reference

1538
02:33:21,590 --> 02:33:29,250
sheet of this because this is just me fucking sketching it
out and I feel like it's so dirty right now it's so it's so

1539
02:33:29,250 --> 02:33:37,670
rough I feel like Tim will do a better job and put much more
effort.

1540
02:33:37,850 --> 02:33:40,710
And I should repay you for such a neat concept.

1541
02:33:40,890 --> 02:33:43,990
I really did like the concept that they did.

1542
02:33:44,610 --> 02:33:48,450
What would happen if Long-A-Goon is just a nesticle?

1543
02:33:51,830 --> 02:33:52,390
Okay.

1544
02:33:52,810 --> 02:33:55,350
I wonder what it would be like if it just has no arms.

1545
02:33:56,050 --> 02:33:56,570
Oh, no.

1546
02:33:56,670 --> 02:33:57,810
That looks so bad.

1547
02:33:58,070 --> 02:33:58,410
It's like...

1548
02:33:59,350 --> 02:34:00,650
You need arms.

1549
02:34:01,570 --> 02:34:03,010
Long Goon needs arms.

1550
02:34:04,790 --> 02:34:05,610
This is it.

1551
02:34:06,470 --> 02:34:09,050
This is the evolution line.

1552
02:34:11,110 --> 02:34:11,750
Size-wise.

1553
02:34:12,130 --> 02:34:14,670
Chunky Goon is much bigger.

1554
02:34:15,190 --> 02:34:18,630
It's bigger than base Goons.

1555
02:34:18,850 --> 02:34:19,770
Default Goons.

1556
02:34:20,110 --> 02:34:25,490
The Chunky Goon is ginormous compared to the Default Goons.

1557
02:34:25,690 --> 02:34:28,370
And then Long Goons is like just long.

1558
02:34:29,470 --> 02:34:31,550
The body is very similar.

1559
02:34:31,570 --> 02:34:39,390
to the default goon um he just has a very long neck that's
really it and then there's eight goons with his fucking

1560
02:34:39,390 --> 02:34:48,510
stick legs hey i think we did it we named we named and gave
you guys a form oh my god this should have been on done on

1561
02:34:48,510 --> 02:35:03,450
like day two but like there should have been a lot of things
done i did my best all right i did my best all right I hope

1562
02:35:03,450 --> 02:35:08,570
you guys liked the little naming ceremony for all of you.

1563
02:35:09,670 --> 02:35:13,910
And also for all the naming ceremony and your true form.

1564
02:35:14,510 --> 02:35:15,570
Your true form.

1565
02:35:16,230 --> 02:35:17,590
My little dragoons.

1566
02:35:18,530 --> 02:35:24,750
My little dragoons that are now based off of a military
unit, by the way.

1567
02:35:24,950 --> 02:35:26,450
Just so you all know.

1568
02:35:29,210 --> 02:35:31,550
It's all based off of my love.

1569
02:35:31,570 --> 02:35:35,250
for Starcraft and military units.

1570
02:35:37,250 --> 02:35:39,750
But now you're now full birds.

1571
02:35:40,070 --> 02:35:42,310
Now you have evolved into little birds.

1572
02:35:43,070 --> 02:35:43,450
But yeah.

1573
02:35:43,670 --> 02:35:45,010
