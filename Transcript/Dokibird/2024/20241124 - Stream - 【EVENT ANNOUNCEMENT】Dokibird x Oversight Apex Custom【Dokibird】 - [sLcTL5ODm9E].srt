1
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:15,440
Okay, oh my god, I'm very sorry.

2
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,620
This took so long.

3
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:21,340
I just realized our BGM stopped.

4
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,140
I don't have a BGM, everybody.

5
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:26,260
I forgot one thing.

6
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:26,880
Everything.

7
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,880
This, okay, I need to tell you guys.

8
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:31,400
I'm very sorry for all of you.

9
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:32,540
Thank you for staying up.

10
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,220
I'm so sorry.

11
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,720
There's a lot of technical difficulties, but thank you so much for staying up.

12
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:47,020
I really appreciate it, and I'm very sorry if you're like, Please, Doki, I fucking waited for so long.

13
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:52,540
Thank you, everybody, for waiting.

14
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,900
I don't have a BGM right now.

15
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,260
I mean, technically, you know what?

16
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,660
Let's grab something.

17
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:00,400
Maybe I can grab something real quick.

18
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,220
Give me a sec.

19
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:06,600
Maybe I can find something for us.

20
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:14,500
Oh my gosh, just so you guys know, I am a mess right now.

21
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:21,860
Everything that could sort of go wrong, sort of went wrong.

22
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:33,240
Everything went wrong throughout the planning of this entire thing.

23
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:39,940
So, that's why, like, you know, I've just been, like, going, doing, there's been so much stuff.

24
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,700
There's honestly, like, maybe this music.

25
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,200
I don't know what this sounds like.

26
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:45,640
Maybe this would fit.

27
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:47,260
Let's see, where is it?

28
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,800
Oh, I'm sorry if this was really loud.

29
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,460
I'm really sorry.

30
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,580
I can't even hear it.

31
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:51,580
What is this?

32
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:52,520
Media Source 7?

33
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,160
Okay, this works.

34
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:56,480
This...

35
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,100
This works.

36
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:11,100
Yes, alright.

37
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:11,960
You know what?

38
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,640
This works.

39
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,060
Hello, everybody.

40
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:22,840
So, if you guys didn't know, I've been organizing this ApeDokiBird X Oversight Apex Custom.

41
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:31,760
And it has been, we've gone through a lot for this.

42
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:41,880
There's, we had, like, we had an issue the day before where we were missing one JP pro player.

43
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:44,660
Because we found out on, actually, no, two.

44
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:48,720
We found out on the, like, we were missing a JP pro player.

45
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,700
Because their manager got back and was like, sorry, our schedules just don't align.

46
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,680
But we found out the day before.

47
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,660
So we were scrambling to get a replacement.

48
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,460
Because we put all in on those pro players.

49
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:04,040
Because Tempo was like, don't worry, they'll say yes.

50
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,260
They didn't say yes.

51
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:12,320
So we were like, fuck, okay, we can find one more.

52
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:20,800
So, not only that, but I also had to find replacements for other players, too.

53
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:26,760
So, like, at one point, we had two teams that wanted to merge together.

54
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,660
Because, from the forum.

55
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:33,680
So, this whole custom, there's gonna be people I've personally invited.

56
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,940
People that asked me for an invitation.

57
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:40,000
And people that applied via the forum.

58
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,280
Unlucky for me, there were some people who applied from the forum that I invited via the forum.

59
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:52,800
And they wanted to merge teams together because they couldn't get another plus one.

60
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,620
So I was like, yeah, sure.

61
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:00,560
But then I had to do, because of the merging of the teams, it was like super last minute.

62
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:07,580
And then I had to, in 24 hours, find an entire team replacement.

63
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:09,640
And I'm like, ah!

64
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,740
So I was like, ah!

65
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,060
It would've been 24 hours, because, you know, today I had to announce it.

66
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:27,800
So, yeah, so, luckily, an entire team is just two players.

67
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,280
Because Temple got me on the pro player.

68
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,940
Sorry, okay, I'll turn it down.

69
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,020
Temple got me in the pro player.

70
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:35,860
You know how?

71
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:42,520
Because I asked, okay, by the way, I was like, Temple, how the fuck do you, this is the hardest thing I've ever organized.

72
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:51,840
I've organized so many events, but this right here has to be anything that could go wrong has went wrong.

73
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,980
And this is 60 players.

74
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:58,760
To be fair, this is the most amount of players in an event that I've hosted.

75
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,940
So, like, I had to coordinate with 60 fucking players.

76
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,260
By the, me and Temple.

77
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,760
Temple got the pro players down.

78
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,580
He was like, he's got that shit down.

79
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,940
I had to deal with the others.

80
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,680
I had to find the others.

81
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:21,080
So, like, at one point, like, I would invite people.

82
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,100
Like, not invite, but like, some people have captains.

83
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:27,220
We'll have a captain slot, because I was like, you go find the other player.

84
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,440
And they'll come back to me and be like, I don't know who to get.

85
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:33,980
And I'll be like, okay, you play with this person.

86
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,600
You're going to play with this person.

87
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,640
I would message, like, six plus people.

88
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:45,620
Like, one of them, literally, I had an emergency replacement that I had to find.

89
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:51,940
I had to find an emergency replacement three hours ago.

90
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:58,380
Three hours ago, I got an emergency replacement.

91
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,500
Because they were like, we couldn't get a plus.

92
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,700
We couldn't find a plus one.

93
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:06,140
So, I was like, I messaged, like, six plus people.

94
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,600
And I was like, by the way, I'm messaging a lot of people.

95
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,640
So, like, whoever responds first, you're in.

96
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:12,500
You're in.

97
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:16,100
You're fucking in.

98
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:21,980
By the way, because of all of this that's going on, I have emergency backup subs now.

99
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:22,920
Just in case.

100
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:25,380
I was like, I'm sorry, we finally filled the slot.

101
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:27,320
But, like, don't worry.

102
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:34,980
If anybody drops out on the 30th, are you okay to be an emergency backup?

103
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,300
And they're like, yeah, we can.

104
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,380
So, I was like, oh, thank God.

105
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,140
And then I asked Tempo.

106
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,580
I asked Tempo.

107
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:45,400
I was like, how the fuck do you do this every day?

108
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:57,340
I was like, how the fuck do you fucking coordinate with 60 people every fucking day of your life?

109
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:00,400
And he was like, I'm just used to it.

110
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,680
He was like, you don't understand, Doki.

111
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:13,120
As being in charge of oversight, if any pro player pisses me off, they will get blacklisted.

112
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:18,760
And I, and oversight, is in charge of majority of the tournaments in NA.

113
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:19,900
So...

114
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:25,200
So, he was like, so...

115
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:35,420
So, because of that, they do not want to piss him off.

116
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,680
I do not have that power, sadly.

117
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:49,660
He was also like, he was like telling me, he was telling me, he was like, oh, yeah.

118
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,420
I also dealt with kids before, because he used to be a teacher.

119
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,220
So, to him, Apex players are like children to him.

120
00:08:56,660 --> 00:09:01,120
So, he's like, he was a teacher before.

121
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,180
So, he knows how to handle children.

122
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,520
I don't.

123
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,520
So, he's like, if anything...

124
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,240
He's dealt with worse and everything.

125
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:19,080
So, he's just like, you get used to it.

126
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,880
And I'm like, I don't know, I don't know if I can.

127
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:26,560
This was honestly the most, one of the most frustrating things I've ever planned.

128
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,980
Like coordinating with 60 people, it has to be...

129
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:32,900
By the way, I need you guys to know, it's me and Tempo.

130
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,340
Doing all of this.

131
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,920
I don't have management helping me out with this, because...

132
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,640
I like organizing events myself, because I like full control on things.

133
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,760
Because it's the only way I can feel control.

134
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:49,440
But, oh my gosh, that was a little bit of a mistake.

135
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,500
Oh my god.

136
00:09:54,680 --> 00:10:00,080
The roadblocks I had to go through to get all of this put together.

137
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,240
Like, everything together and everything.

138
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,900
I'm a very big professionist either, so...

139
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:09,220
Everything sort of came down, like, last minute.

140
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,080
And everything, and...

141
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,480
I'm just glad we're here now.

142
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:22,360
I'm so glad we're here now.

143
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:26,000
Oh my god, I wish I could like...

144
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,760
Like, I'm just like re-reading my messages.

145
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:36,240
I'm re-reading my messages to Tempo.

146
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:39,380
And I'm just like, how do you do it?

147
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:44,660
It's just me screaming into the void.

148
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,800
And the void is...

149
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,920
The void is literally Tempo.

150
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:55,840
Because the last two weeks was just me fucking screaming.

151
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,420
Oh my god.

152
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:08,820
Anyway.

153
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,300
Let us...

154
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:14,360
Let us give you guys, if you guys don't know the time.

155
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,200
Here is the time for the entire event.

156
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,720
I'm sorry, I know the BGM is a little bit weird.

157
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:21,900
Because it's like...

158
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:24,640
I was desperate to... I don't have a BGM.

159
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,360
That was like the one thing I forgot to do.

160
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:27,620
So, if you guys didn't see the time.

161
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,160
You guys are not gonna hear me too.

162
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,600
It's gonna be silent, by the way.

163
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:31,780
Actually...

164
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:32,230
No, I can put...

165
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,880
I can like, put the picture.

166
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,900
Sorry, I'm like coughing too.

167
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:40,500
My... Everything's going...

168
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:41,320
Everything.

169
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:43,740
So...

170
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:44,060
Wow!

171
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:46,360
I was gonna swap it.

172
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,380
But then I was like...

173
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,160
Ah, fuck it.

174
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:48,740
Yeah!

175
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,160
November 30th!

176
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:53,220
Which is December 1st in Japan.

177
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,120
6pm PST.

178
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,620
11am JST.

179
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,180
Ooh, logo!

180
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,620
Why you look at this?

181
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:03,900
I might need to get cough drops.

182
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:04,680
I'm sorry.

183
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,880
Everything came together.

184
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,440
I need a cough drop.

185
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:27,470
Professional event announcements I've ever done.

186
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:28,610
I'm very sorry.

187
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:29,770
Um...

188
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:34,790
Actually, the most professional event announcement.

189
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:35,930
This is...

190
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:37,370
Alright, so...

191
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:39,170
Literally, it is next week.

192
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:40,370
It is next week.

193
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:45,750
So, it's gonna be on a Saturday for NA.

194
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:47,650
And now you're wondering...

195
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:50,530
Why are you organizing this custom?

196
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:52,190
Well...

197
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:54,150
Let me head off to...

198
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:56,350
The slides real quick.

199
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:57,390
It's slide time!

200
00:12:57,730 --> 00:12:58,030
It's...

201
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:59,390
I mean, you guys already knew the time.

202
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:00,650
Like, it was on the forum.

203
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:01,330
But!

204
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:03,750
It's slides time!

205
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:04,830
For the information!

206
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:10,950
Oh my god, here we go!

207
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:12,150
Alright!

208
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:15,130
Sorry, the music stopped instantly.

209
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:19,970
But I'll add it back in.

210
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:20,690
Don't worry.

211
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:22,510
I think it was source 7.

212
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:23,350
I think it was this one.

213
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:24,170
Yes, there we go.

214
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:24,850
Alright!

215
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:26,510
So...

216
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:28,110
I'm gonna be calling our...

217
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:29,490
Our JP guy.

218
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:30,550
Real quick.

219
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:31,450
So...

220
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:33,310
When we get to the Japanese slides...

221
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:37,310
We're gonna call our JP translator to read it out in Japanese for those who are here.

222
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:41,690
Because we do have JP participants in this custom.

223
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,230
For those who don't know...

224
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:45,650
This custom is not a serious custom!

225
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:46,890
It's not like...

226
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:50,510
It's not like a really serious custom regarding...

227
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,490
I mean, there is prize money.

228
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,590
But I'll talk about that more later.

229
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:57,630
But...

230
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:59,350
This is more so...

231
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:01,470
Something where there's fun game modes.

232
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:02,850
There's a lot of players in here.

233
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:04,510
They're not Apex players.

234
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:06,110
Or like...

235
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:06,770
They're not pro.

236
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:07,770
They're more casual.

237
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:11,350
They never hit like Diamond or maybe like Plat or anything.

238
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:14,030
But they really like playing Apex.

239
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:16,410
So...

240
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:18,770
Because of that...

241
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:20,450
This is actually my very first time...

242
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:21,530
Not first time, but like...

243
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:22,270
As Jokey.

244
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:26,250
Organizing a more competitive esport-ish...

245
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,550
Esport type of...

246
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:29,450
Event.

247
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:31,310
And...

248
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:35,110
Because of this.

249
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:36,450
This is like a pilot episode.

250
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:40,270
This is essentially like a pilot.

251
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:41,590
Regarding like...

252
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:42,530
How...

253
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:43,450
How...

254
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,210
How...

255
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:46,690
How is...

256
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:47,530
No, no, okay.

257
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:52,410
How difficult is it to organize NA VTubers to come together?

258
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:56,170
And I learned today.

259
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:58,530
It is very difficult.

260
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:00,770
Not even today.

261
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:02,570
The last month...

262
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:04,990
Is incredibly difficult.

263
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:11,710
So...

264
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:12,710
Yes, we're...

265
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,110
We're trying our best here.

266
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:17,150
Anyway.

267
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:18,470
So, by the way.

268
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:20,470
This is not just NA VTubers.

269
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:23,070
They're VTubers in Asia.

270
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:24,510
In different parts of Asia.

271
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:27,770
And we slip in some Europeans in here.

272
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:29,150
Because like...

273
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:30,190
You know, it's my custom.

274
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:31,690
Like, it's my rules.

275
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:33,010
Literally, we told them.

276
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:34,590
Are you cool playing with three...

277
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:36,170
They're like, we want to play with this person.

278
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:37,990
Like, the captain would be like...

279
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:39,730
I know you said no Europeans.

280
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:41,610
But like...

281
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:43,930
I really want to play with this person.

282
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:45,230
And I was like...

283
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:46,950
Okay, let me ask Tempo.

284
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:48,270
Let me ask Oversight.

285
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:50,790
And Oversight was like...

286
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:52,330
They're gonna get 300 ping.

287
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:55,030
So then, I went back and I was like...

288
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:56,330
They're gonna play with 300 ping.

289
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:56,870
Are you sure?

290
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:58,130
And they're like...

291
00:15:58,130 --> 00:15:59,270
Yeah, they're cool with that.

292
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:01,930
So, if they fucking complain about the ping.

293
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:03,550
That's on them.

294
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:09,070
We warned them.

295
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:11,150
We were very clear.

296
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:14,570
About the ping situation.

297
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:20,150
So, I weaved the rules regarding...

298
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:24,350
Regarding, like, allowing European players.

299
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:26,990
If the captains wanted to play with a European player.

300
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:28,250
Then fine.

301
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:29,310
You got this.

302
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:31,150
If you're wondering if there's any European pros.

303
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:32,970
Nope, because they're smarter than that.

304
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:34,410
They're...

305
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:38,030
The European pro players.

306
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:40,830
That are currently in active ALGS.

307
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:43,590
They were like...

308
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:43,650
No.

309
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:47,610
They're like...

310
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:48,610
You know...

311
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:49,350
If anybody...

312
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:51,250
Pro players would definitely complain about the ping.

313
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:53,090
So, they're just like...

314
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:54,110
No, fuck that shit.

315
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:55,330
Anyway.

316
00:16:56,750 --> 00:17:00,890
This is a collaboration with Oversight.

317
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:02,510
For those who don't know what Oversight is.

318
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:03,510
They're basically...

319
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:06,510
The official organizers of...

320
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:10,910
Majority of the well-known scrims going on.

321
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:12,530
With ALGS and BLGS.

322
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:15,210
So, like, international scrims and everything.

323
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:17,650
That's why Tempo was like...

324
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:19,470
Yeah, like, if they are not...

325
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:20,590
They're afraid of me.

326
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:23,310
It was so smooth sailing.

327
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:25,130
Getting NA pros in here, by the way.

328
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:28,150
It was actually, like, one of the fucking easiest things.

329
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:29,650
Throughout the entire thing.

330
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,390
Because, like...

331
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:32,610
He was just like...

332
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:33,130
You want in?

333
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:34,870
Yeah, fucking get in here.

334
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:40,550
So...

335
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:43,410
They're very well-known within the Apex Legends scene.

336
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:45,950
And they helped us with getting...

337
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:48,610
Lots of well-known pros you might recognize.

338
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:50,210
In this custom.

339
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:52,390
So, yes.

340
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:53,750
We're gonna see that later on.

341
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:57,510
This will be officially sponsored.

342
00:17:58,570 --> 00:17:59,430
I can't say it yet.

343
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:00,810
Because I'm still negotiating.

344
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:03,290
We're...

345
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:06,130
Still in the middle of negotiations.

346
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:07,790
With our sponsor.

347
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:10,790
So, we'll be announcing the sponsor at a later time.

348
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:12,550
At a later time.

349
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:14,090
During the custom.

350
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:15,590
So...

351
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:17,030
It's actually...

352
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:18,090
It's a really big deal.

353
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:19,250
So...

354
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:21,050
We were originally not gonna have any sponsors.

355
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:23,430
But...

356
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:25,890
In the end, we managed to...

357
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:26,750
They were like...

358
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:27,050
You know what?

359
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:29,010
We wanna do something with you and your custom.

360
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:30,050
And so...

361
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:31,730
But we're still in negotiations right now.

362
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:32,330
So...

363
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:33,710
I can't reveal who it is.

364
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:36,210
I can't reveal what they're gonna be helping out with.

365
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:37,590
But...

366
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:39,410
You'll find out at a later date.

367
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:40,190
Because I was like...

368
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:41,630
Are you guys actually gonna do it?

369
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:42,070
And they were like...

370
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:42,550
Yeah, we will.

371
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:43,950
We just need to like...

372
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:44,690
Talk with like...

373
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:44,950
Legal.

374
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:49,190
So...

375
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:50,830
They will be helping out.

376
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:51,470
Just...

377
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:52,430
We haven't...

378
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:53,830
We haven't like...

379
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:54,610
You know...

380
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:55,670
Finished negotiating.

381
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:57,090
And it will be done soon.

382
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:01,490
Anyway...

383
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:02,470
For also...

384
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:03,370
Another point...

385
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:04,350
Is that...

386
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:05,610
Nicewig and Greek...

387
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:08,010
Who are very well known in the scene...

388
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:09,870
For casting the BLGS...

389
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:10,670
And regarding like...

390
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:11,690
The B-Stream...

391
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:12,890
Within ALGS...

392
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:13,800
They will be casting...

393
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:14,790
The custom.

394
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:17,850
They will also be doing interviews.

395
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:20,930
So I thought this would be a great idea.

396
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:21,820
Because especially...

397
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,690
Especially with the sake...

398
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:27,330
With a lot of JP players.

399
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:28,330
A lot of JP VTubers...

400
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:30,370
Are gonna have a chance...

401
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:32,210
To talk to Nicewig and Greek.

402
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:33,550
They're gonna...

403
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:35,150
We're gonna be bringing them in...

404
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:36,570
To my voice channel.

405
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:37,550
And we're gonna...

406
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:38,130
Whoever...

407
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:39,370
People who win the custom...

408
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:40,130
Like each game...

409
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:40,930
Each game is a winner.

410
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:43,470
So each winner of each game...

411
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:44,790
Within the custom...

412
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:45,750
Will have a chance...

413
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:48,370
To be able to talk to the official casters...

414
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:49,530
Of ALGS.

415
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:50,910
So...

416
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:53,670
That was an opportunity I thought...

417
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:55,330
Would be amazing opportunity...

418
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:57,250
For people.

419
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:59,330
And I figured like...

420
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:02,330
For those who really wanted to meet Nicewig...

421
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:03,390
And Greek.

422
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:04,750
Especially when there's language...

423
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:05,770
Language differences.

424
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:08,310
We will have a translator there.

425
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:09,250
For them.

426
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:11,310
To help translate the conversation.

427
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:14,270
And that was like an opportunity I wanted to offer to people.

428
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:15,770
Especially with the language differences.

429
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:17,710
Not a lot of people get to talk to Wig.

430
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,350
Not a lot of people get to talk to Greek.

431
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:20,530
When it comes to like...

432
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:21,090
You know...

433
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:22,510
VTubers and casual streamers.

434
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,190
A lot of pros get to talk to him.

435
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:26,030
I talk to Wig all the fucking time.

436
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:27,070
But like...

437
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:28,250
That's just favoritism.

438
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:30,110
Like...

439
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:33,430
So...

440
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:36,310
But like...

441
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:38,230
I'm trying to give this opportunity to others.

442
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:39,350
Who maybe like you know...

443
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:40,930
Idolize Wig and Greek.

444
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:43,050
Be able to actually talk to them.

445
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:43,830
And stuff.

446
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:47,450
Yeah, that's called being friends.

447
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:51,050
Bestie privileges.

448
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:54,550
Anyway...

449
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:55,250
So...

450
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,470
The reason why I organized this custom.

451
00:20:58,050 --> 00:20:59,410
Was because...

452
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:00,690
You guys didn't know.

453
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:02,210
The champions.

454
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:03,970
The ALGS champs.

455
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:05,530
Is being currently hosted.

456
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:06,690
In Japan.

457
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:07,870
So...

458
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:08,210
So...

459
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:10,610
Basically like you know...

460
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:11,330
I heard that...

461
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:13,110
I heard that like...

462
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:15,550
Tickets already sold out really fast.

463
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:18,210
For the ALGS champs lan.

464
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:18,950
So...

465
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:19,670
Which was crazy.

466
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:20,770
Cause like you know...

467
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:21,030
It was supposed to be like...

468
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,470
It sold out really fast and everything.

469
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:25,570
And...

470
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:27,690
I also wanted a chance to unite...

471
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:29,510
Vtubers from around the world.

472
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:31,510
Whether they're indie or corporate.

473
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:33,070
Or they're pro or casual.

474
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:34,530
Or even if like you know...

475
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:36,350
They're big streamers or small streamers.

476
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:37,630
It was very hard.

477
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:39,850
I tried to balance out this custom.

478
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:41,470
With small streamers.

479
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:42,570
Big streamers.

480
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:44,150
Indies.

481
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:44,810
Companies.

482
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:46,070
So like when people...

483
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:46,930
When I had like you know...

484
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:47,950
People dropping out.

485
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:49,150
And stuff.

486
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:50,930
Or like they weren't allowed to participate.

487
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:51,590
Or something.

488
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:54,970
I tried to match it with...

489
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:56,470
Somebody that's similar.

490
00:21:57,330 --> 00:21:58,990
That's similar numbers.

491
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:00,150
Similar like...

492
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:03,650
Like NA or APAC.

493
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:04,170
Or anything.

494
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:04,730
Just like...

495
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:06,170
Just to make sure.

496
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:07,890
That it's sort of balanced and everything.

497
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:10,650
And...

498
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:11,510
It was very difficult.

499
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:14,270
I have like...

500
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:16,030
Three fucking emergency backups.

501
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:17,650
Just in case this happens again.

502
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:20,810
Like...

503
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:23,150
I had...

504
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:25,270
Like at that point.

505
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:26,610
I was just like...

506
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:27,190
Bro fuck.

507
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:28,670
Fuck.

508
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:31,570
When I had to grab like...

509
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:32,030
Somebody.

510
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:33,030
Confirm somebody.

511
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:34,810
Like three hours ago.

512
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:36,370
Or like four hours ago.

513
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:37,990
I was just like...

514
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:38,890
Oh fuck this.

515
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:40,440
I'm gonna get like...

516
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:43,110
Three extra backups.

517
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:45,870
Just in case something happens.

518
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:47,170
On the 30th.

519
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:48,050
So...

520
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:51,510
Yeah.

521
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:52,950
So like...

522
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:53,650
I have like a lot back.

523
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:53,910
Anyway.

524
00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:54,450
Like I said.

525
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:55,670
This is...

526
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:56,910
We wanna create like a funny event.

527
00:22:56,970 --> 00:22:58,350
We don't get a lot of these types of events.

528
00:22:58,650 --> 00:22:59,130
In NA.

529
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:01,010
Or English speaking events by the way.

530
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:02,710
You know.

531
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:04,650
We see a lot of that in Japan.

532
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:06,430
We...

533
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:09,850
We see a lot of these types of events in Japan and everything.

534
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:11,290
And...

535
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:13,310
But we don't see this a lot in NA.

536
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:14,870
So this is like...

537
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:15,610
Since like...

538
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:15,990
You know.

539
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:19,130
I thought APEX would be...

540
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:20,050
This would have been the easiest.

541
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:21,490
But silly me.

542
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:23,390
I need to fucking get 60 players.

543
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,050
I was like...

544
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:28,170
This is gonna be my test run.

545
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:29,130
To see if like...

546
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:31,290
To see if I can do it.

547
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:33,270
See if I can organize these types of events.

548
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:36,350
I chose APEX as the first one.

549
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:37,530
As my first pilot episode.

550
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:39,230
Because I thought...

551
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:39,570
You know.

552
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:41,350
Since I came from an APEX background.

553
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:42,250
And like...

554
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:42,410
You know.

555
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:45,350
I have Temple here to help me regarding finding pro players.

556
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:46,910
It wouldn't be that bad.

557
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:47,690
But then...

558
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:49,870
This was one of the hardest things I ever organized.

559
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:50,630
I...

560
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:54,470
Literally don't think I've done something as stressful as this before.

561
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:59,130
Because you would think...

562
00:23:59,130 --> 00:23:59,790
That...

563
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:00,650
When you invite a captain.

564
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:02,550
They do the rest of the work.

565
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:05,290
That was not the case for some of the...

566
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:06,190
Some of the...

567
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:07,450
Some of the things that happened.

568
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:09,910
I had to like...

569
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:11,070
Piece teams together.

570
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:11,810
And be like...

571
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:12,750
Meet your new friend.

572
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:18,290
Because sometimes I had people that were like...

573
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,290
I can't get a plus one.

574
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:20,370
And I'd be like...

575
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:21,510
This is your new friend now.

576
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:26,870
You're gonna be playing with them for three to four hours on Saturday.

577
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:28,150
Good luck.

578
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:34,350
So...

579
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:34,950
Yeah.

580
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:36,650
So I had to do that a lot.

581
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:40,170
It wasn't that easy when you give like somebody a captain spot.

582
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:41,270
And like...

583
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:42,070
They get...

584
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:42,350
You know.

585
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:43,650
They get the plus one.

586
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:46,170
Sometimes I had to get the plus one.

587
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:46,590
So...

588
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:50,570
So...

589
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:51,070
There's that.

590
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:51,530
Anyway.

591
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:53,070
This one goes okay.

592
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:56,950
I'd love to organize more customs themed around competitive games.

593
00:24:57,210 --> 00:24:58,350
It's a lot easier...

594
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:00,230
Um...

595
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:03,350
Doing events that are not based off competitive.

596
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:04,610
Because...

597
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:05,070
Like even...

598
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:05,630
I won't...

599
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:08,250
I won't categorize as Minecraft events as competitive.

600
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:09,210
Because that's something I'm...

601
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:10,690
I'm planning on in 2025.

602
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:11,390
Like a...

603
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:12,790
A big Minecraft event.

604
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:13,810
Um...

605
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:14,770
Because like...

606
00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:15,790
Everybody plays Minecraft.

607
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:18,630
And you can divide it by skill level very easily.

608
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:19,850
And like you don't...

609
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:21,770
It doesn't have to be like very competitively.

610
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:23,390
Apex on the other hand...

611
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:25,670
Not everybody plays Apex.

612
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:26,610
And...

613
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:28,410
Not everyone would...

614
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:28,690
Um...

615
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:29,970
Especially in NA.

616
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:31,890
It's very limited.

617
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:34,310
When it comes to like...

618
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:34,590
Um...

619
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:37,630
People who are interested in these types of events.

620
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:38,710
So...

621
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:40,090
It was incredibly hard...

622
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:42,050
Much harder to find participants.

623
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:44,130
And I had to find like...

624
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:45,010
Well not 60.

625
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:46,330
Because we do have...

626
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:47,610
I had to find like...

627
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:48,470
You know...

628
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:49,830
30 other players.

629
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:50,950
Because I assumed...

630
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:52,050
No actually 40 players.

631
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:53,730
Because like 20 of them were pro players.

632
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:54,390
Um...

633
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:55,310
Because each team...

634
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:55,830
Not even...

635
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:56,270
Not even...

636
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:56,430
No.

637
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:56,750
No.

638
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:57,610
It's like 50.

639
00:25:57,910 --> 00:25:59,550
Because like not every team...

640
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:01,150
Not every team wanted a pro player.

641
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:03,350
Some teams are full VTuber teams by the way.

642
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:04,530
Um...

643
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:05,210
So...

644
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:06,390
There's also that too.

645
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:08,030
Um...

646
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:08,530
So yes.

647
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:09,490
It was very difficult.

648
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:10,850
And...

649
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:11,970
Through this...

650
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:12,590
I will see...

651
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:16,770
How we go about organizing more competitive ones.

652
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:18,470
I'm actually in talks...

653
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:20,830
Regarding organizing a...

654
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:22,950
Maybe an FGC type thing.

655
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:23,810
So like...

656
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:25,250
From this...

657
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,010
I'm learning from this right now.

658
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:29,870
On how to make something better for FGC.

659
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:31,210
So...

660
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:37,070
So I'm learning from this at the moment.

661
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:41,630
Won't be 60 players though.

662
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:46,330
At least...

663
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:47,670
In that area...

664
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:49,270
It won't be 60 players.

665
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:50,090
Um...

666
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:51,230
Because FGC...

667
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:52,170
Especially Street Fighter...

668
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:53,530
Is incredibly popular in Japan...

669
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:55,170
In the VTubing sphere right now.

670
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:56,490
So I noticed that.

671
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:57,290
So like...

672
00:26:57,290 --> 00:26:58,590
I'm using this as like...

673
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:00,470
To figure out how the fuck to...

674
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:01,410
Do something similar.

675
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:05,390
Anyway...

676
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:06,250
Let's...

677
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,250
Get our...

678
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,590
I'm sorry...

679
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:08,870
JP...

680
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:10,010
JP bro...

681
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:10,510
I'm sorry.

682
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:12,270
I know like...

683
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:13,250
Um...

684
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:14,570
I'm gonna call you now.

685
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:20,490
I'm gonna call our translator now.

686
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:23,790
By the way...

687
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:24,510
He's gonna be like...

688
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:25,830
Translating this on his phone.

689
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:26,570
Hey.

690
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:27,370
Hey Dash.

691
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:29,890
Wait a sec.

692
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:30,390
Wait a sec.

693
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:33,230
Yeah, I got the summary up.

694
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:36,110
By the way, this is Dash.

695
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:37,850
He's our official translator guy.

696
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:39,310
If you guys don't know him...

697
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:42,510
He was the sub for RPR's BLGS team.

698
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:44,610
And he translates a lot for other...

699
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:45,830
Apex tournaments.

700
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:47,890
So yeah.

701
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:48,890
That's Dash.

702
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:52,050
Hello, hello, hello.

703
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:52,890
Do you guys hear me?

704
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:54,150
Oh my god.

705
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:56,910
He's on his phone right now.

706
00:27:58,250 --> 00:27:58,930
I'm sorry.

707
00:27:59,070 --> 00:27:59,850
Okay, let me explain.

708
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:00,810
Let me explain first.

709
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:01,690
Let me explain first.

710
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:05,270
I didn't know that I have to explain...

711
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:05,830
Stream.

712
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:07,250
Wait, I told you!

713
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:08,750
Okay, that's a miscommunication.

714
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:10,950
That was like a miscommunication, right?

715
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:11,490
Yeah, yeah.

716
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:12,510
So yeah, I know, I know.

717
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:13,490
That was my bad.

718
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:14,710
But like, I didn't know that.

719
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:17,070
So I'm in the friend's house in the toilet.

720
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:18,790
Oh, you're in the...

721
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:20,430
So yeah.

722
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:24,190
And my friend's literally playing the BLGS right now.

723
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:25,530
Oh shit!

724
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:27,610
Wait, he's playing BLGS right now?

725
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:28,490
How is he doing?

726
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:30,810
I don't know.

727
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:33,090
He's like in round 3 or something.

728
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:34,870
He looks like he's doing great, I guess.

729
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:36,070
Oh shit, sweet.

730
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:39,070
Yes, and so I'm on the phone.

731
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:41,630
I'm using my wireless earbuds.

732
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:44,410
And that sounds really bad, I'm sorry.

733
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:45,910
But yeah, I'm...

734
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:52,870
I literally translated this...

735
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:55,710
Yeah, he translated this when he got back.

736
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:57,150
And he was like, shit, I didn't realize.

737
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:59,990
And I was like, what do you think the slides are for?

738
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:04,090
I had to do this like this morning.

739
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:04,890
I woke up.

740
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:05,750
I see this part.

741
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:06,450
Oh shit!

742
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:06,970
You know?

743
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:11,650
Alright, so...

744
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:13,990
Alright, Japanese listeners.

745
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:15,370
I really apologize.

746
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:17,870
I hope you're able to hear what he says.

747
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:21,350
But yes, you go do your thing, Dash.

748
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:22,650
Okay.

749
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:23,870
Konnichiwa.

750
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:24,490
I'm Dash.

751
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:28,230
This time, I'm going to be translating.

752
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:30,110
Okay.

753
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:31,870
So, this is a documentary.

754
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:34,590
It's a collaboration between BLGS and ALGS.

755
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:40,190
It's a collaboration between the two organizations.

756
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:47,090
We don't have any official sponsors.

757
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:51,290
We'll announce the sponsors when we get to them.

758
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:06,970
Okay.

759
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:42,090
Yay!

760
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:44,150
Yay!

761
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:44,730
Yay!

762
00:30:47,810 --> 00:30:48,030
Yay!

763
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:49,730
Yay!

764
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:50,250
Yay!

765
00:30:50,250 --> 00:31:11,230
This is a test event, so there will be other events besides Apex, like Valorant, Street Fighter, League of Legends, and other competitive eSports titles, so please look forward to it.

766
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:25,150
Do I just call you after I'm done for each slide, or will you just be listening?

767
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:29,310
Am I supposed to hit the toilet for entry time, or what?

768
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:30,230
Wait, what?

769
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:34,950
Am I supposed to stay in the bathroom for whole time?

770
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:35,370
Okay.

771
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:41,270
Sorry, we have our translator in the bathroom.

772
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:43,710
Toilet live translation.

773
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:49,950
Guys, like I said, everybody, like, we had a lot of issues.

774
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:58,490
Like her said, we missing like two pro players, right?

775
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:00,910
Yeah, yeah, I told them that story.

776
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:07,530
Yeah, and Dash, we found our final pro player literally like five hours ago.

777
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:12,930
Yeah, yeah, for your warning, we found the last pro player like five hours ago.

778
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:23,450
So like, anything that could go wrong sort of went wrong, so like, we have our translator in the fucking bathroom.

779
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:25,270
Exactly.

780
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:27,550
That's one of the problems.

781
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:33,470
Because of unfortunate miscommunication there.

782
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:42,190
Sorry, I didn't realize that you were at your friend's place.

783
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:48,250
I don't want anyone to like, what, hold these tournaments or even, you know?

784
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:51,350
Yeah, yeah, yeah, he's getting paid by the way, guys.

785
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:52,850
He's not doing it for free.

786
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:55,810
He's like, I'm getting paid, right?

787
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:56,670
And I was like...

788
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:03,450
But yes, by the way, here's the hashtag too, by the way.

789
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:08,270
It's gonna be DokiOversight2024.

790
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:10,250
I just realized I forgot to include the hashtag.

791
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:12,310
But thank you, Dash.

792
00:33:12,810 --> 00:33:16,110
You can, I'll call you when, you can go to the bathroom whenever.

793
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:17,610
I don't know which is easier for you.

794
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:21,210
Do I call you whenever I'm ready for you or you want to stay in the bathroom?

795
00:33:23,290 --> 00:33:26,110
Um, should I just mute in here?

796
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:28,890
Yeah, sure, you can mute in the bathroom, yeah.

797
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:36,390
Alright, yeah, he's gonna be muted in the bathroom until I call him in.

798
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:38,830
Anyway, so, sorry.

799
00:33:39,170 --> 00:33:41,550
That should say rules, by the way, not nerfs.

800
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:49,290
But I hope for those who are JP listeners, I know I'm speaking in English.

801
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:58,210
But, like, for those who know Japanese and English, I hope that the translation has been okay so far.

802
00:33:58,430 --> 00:34:00,570
And that you guys are able to hear it.

803
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:03,590
Anyway, this is supposed to say rules.

804
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:09,250
Anyway, like I said, there will be four fun game modes and two regular matches.

805
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:14,230
We're gonna start off with the normal games on World's Edge.

806
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:16,550
Melee abilities only on Stormpoint.

807
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:19,150
Protect the princess in E-District.

808
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:22,390
Hide and seek on Broken Moon.

809
00:34:22,930 --> 00:34:24,830
Sniper only in E-District.

810
00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:27,830
And Launch Royale on King's Canyon.

811
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:29,990
These are our six games.

812
00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:35,390
Now, teams, for the landmarks, we're not gonna be doing the landmarks on stream.

813
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:38,170
Like, deciding landmarks.

814
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:40,150
That takes too much time.

815
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:44,210
So, I'm gonna fucking spin the wheel off stream.

816
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:50,490
And then whatever happens to them happens.

817
00:34:51,370 --> 00:34:57,650
We're gonna have the official Apex server code because Oversight organizes scrims very regularly.

818
00:34:58,010 --> 00:35:07,870
So, for those who've never watched tournaments in Apex Legends, teams don't drop off and then they have to fly to the landmarks.

819
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:10,190
They spawn into the landmark.

820
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:14,970
So, like, you know, they just spawn in and everything.

821
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:25,030
And what we can do is that for the four fun game modes, you're just gonna spawn in randomly.

822
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:29,390
Like, you can do that with an official Apex server code.

823
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:33,610
So, we literally click randomize and we don't know who's gonna get what.

824
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:40,750
We don't know who's gonna be getting what landmark.

825
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:43,330
Not even me because we're doing it live.

826
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:52,550
But the normal game modes, which is gonna be number one and six, we're gonna have assigned landmarks.

827
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:53,550
But we're gonna spin the wheel.

828
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:56,590
So, at least they know where it's gonna be.

829
00:35:59,070 --> 00:35:59,950
Anyway, prizes.

830
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:02,670
I know a lot of you guys are freaking out about the prizes.

831
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:10,270
So, the reason I am personally funding this custom.

832
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:14,170
Yes, it is $30,000 of my own money.

833
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:16,410
That's not from the sponsor.

834
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:21,610
It might even be more if the sponsor, like, after negotiations with the sponsor.

835
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:27,870
But it is $30,000 of my own money.

836
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:33,060
It's not like I'm fucking bathing in money right now.

837
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:39,810
But the reason why is that I wanted to encourage people.

838
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:44,370
I never really was public about, like, what the prizes were when people were invited.

839
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:49,870
Literally, people found out what the prizes were when they joined the server.

840
00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:52,470
So, it was a little, like, surprise, you know.

841
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:56,150
Actually, the only people that knew were the pros.

842
00:36:57,090 --> 00:37:04,110
Because money is... the pros would only really join due to the money.

843
00:37:05,350 --> 00:37:10,410
So, only the pros knew about the money prizes.

844
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:16,070
Because it was the way to incentivize the pros to join as well.

845
00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:29,430
Because of that, we wanted to give this opportunity.

846
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:33,830
Especially, a lot of these players are giving up their own time to participate.

847
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:35,850
This is why I always wanted an event.

848
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:41,030
I just wanted, you know, a way to, like, have, like, memories from the event.

849
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:46,990
And being able to, you know, get something physical from it.

850
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:47,870
If you do really well.

851
00:37:47,970 --> 00:37:49,110
Because, like, you know, I get it.

852
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:50,190
You did well.

853
00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:51,070
You can brag about it.

854
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:52,890
But it's all, like, you know, that's really it.

855
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:54,270
You got the stream memories from it.

856
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:57,670
But I always wanted, like, something physical that you can look back on physically.

857
00:37:57,670 --> 00:37:58,830
If you can look at something.

858
00:38:00,370 --> 00:38:07,310
So, I contacted Gamersubs if they were interested in providing medals to the winners.

859
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:09,210
At first, I was like, I'll pay you guys.

860
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:13,610
Because I knew they've made me, like, the enamel pins in the past.

861
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:14,530
Like, memorabilia.

862
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:19,390
So, like, for WrestleTuber, I think I've shown you guys this before in the past.

863
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:24,350
But for WrestleTuber, they made...

864
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:27,930
I actually showed this in the official server.

865
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:30,270
The custom server.

866
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:32,150
But for those who don't know.

867
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:38,370
Everybody that participates is gonna get a pin that's based off of the logo.

868
00:38:38,370 --> 00:38:40,510
And for those who don't know what it looks like.

869
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:42,590
I'm gonna pull it up real quick, guys.

870
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:45,030
I have to save it.

871
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:46,430
Because I just realized that's like...

872
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:49,550
So, this is what it looks like that they've made for me.

873
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:50,550
For WrestleTuber.

874
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:56,350
So, everybody that participated basically received this pin.

875
00:38:56,930 --> 00:39:00,590
Some people didn't receive it because, like, they never replied back to me.

876
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:03,070
So, like...

877
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:04,810
So, it would be like this.

878
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:07,890
But with the logo for this custom.

879
00:39:07,890 --> 00:39:11,870
So, every player, all 60 players will receive something like this.

880
00:39:11,930 --> 00:39:14,730
If they reply back to me and my management and Gamersubs.

881
00:39:14,930 --> 00:39:16,930
So, like, some people might not receive it.

882
00:39:17,210 --> 00:39:19,870
Because, you know, they never replied back.

883
00:39:19,910 --> 00:39:20,970
Or they never filled in the form.

884
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:24,890
We tried to, like, make sure everybody filled it in.

885
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:27,210
But, like, you know, if they didn't get it.

886
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:29,190
Like, we can't wait forever.

887
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:36,490
So, I asked Gamersubs if they could do something like this again.

888
00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:37,830
And I was willing to pay for it.

889
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:38,470
Because, like, you know.

890
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:41,910
I actually asked them, like, two to three weeks.

891
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:43,210
Two weeks ago, I believe.

892
00:39:43,310 --> 00:39:45,810
I asked them two weeks ago if they could.

893
00:39:45,870 --> 00:39:49,950
Because we were trying to look for, like, ways to create more memories for people who participate.

894
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:51,630
And they were like...

895
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:53,710
At first, I was like, I can pay you guys.

896
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:55,390
But then they were like, no, we'll do it for free.

897
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:56,730
Like, we can do it for free for you.

898
00:39:57,110 --> 00:40:01,350
And so, they'll be producing medals for all the teams that win first place.

899
00:40:01,450 --> 00:40:04,310
Every individual that wins first place will get medals and prize money.

900
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:11,650
And second place will also receive physical prizes from our sponsor.

901
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:13,810
So, they might not receive the money.

902
00:40:14,170 --> 00:40:16,770
But they'll receive some physical prizes.

903
00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:18,290
So, at least they get something.

904
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:19,470
So, it's not just first place.

905
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:20,990
But, yeah.

906
00:40:21,610 --> 00:40:23,370
That's basically the rules.

907
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:26,410
Yes, huge thank you to Gamersubs.

908
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:29,650
Did you guys know my Gamersub drop is out now?

909
00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:36,750
And you can support me with me funding more events like this.

910
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:41,910
Also, by the way, the prize money thing, it's not gonna be a thing.

911
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:45,650
It's not gonna be something common throughout my events.

912
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:50,210
The biggest reason why I have a prize money is for the pros.

913
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:55,690
Because, like, the pros, you know, they're giving up their own time.

914
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:58,330
And they don't make a lot of money in general.

915
00:40:58,330 --> 00:40:59,330
So, like...

916
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:05,610
Really, that prize money was, like, for them.

917
00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:06,670
For participating.

918
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:13,270
That's why.

919
00:41:17,530 --> 00:41:18,490
That's why.

920
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:20,490
Because, you know, they have to, like...

921
00:41:20,490 --> 00:41:22,450
So, that's why I did it for them.

922
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:24,550
Just to incentivize them to join.

923
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:27,250
But, yeah.

924
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:28,070
Anyway...

925
00:41:32,610 --> 00:41:39,890
But, I feel like, you know, I really wanted to help out in the community and everything.

926
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:47,750
Anyway, but yes, if you guys didn't know, I do have a Gamersub drop out right now.

927
00:41:47,890 --> 00:41:50,930
Yes, oh my god, yes, Cactus, that's right.

928
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:53,090
Can you post that again so I can pin that message?

929
00:41:53,830 --> 00:41:54,910
We actually found it.

930
00:41:55,210 --> 00:41:56,610
Alright, here you go, guys.

931
00:41:56,610 --> 00:41:58,730
Make sure to use my code, by the way.

932
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:00,970
It actually helps out a lot more.

933
00:42:02,290 --> 00:42:02,690
Anyway...

934
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:05,150
Anyway, Dash, go get in here.

935
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:07,050
We need you to do your bathroom translation.

936
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:10,670
Yeah, if I'm back, toilet Dash is there.

937
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:12,430
Oh, look, there's rules right there, by the way.

938
00:42:12,490 --> 00:42:13,130
There it is.

939
00:42:14,130 --> 00:42:14,750
Oh, wait.

940
00:42:15,130 --> 00:42:15,690
I forgot to...

941
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:18,070
Let me add the JP version.

942
00:42:21,990 --> 00:42:22,790
Thank you.

943
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:25,570
Thanks for staying in the bathroom.

944
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:27,650
Yes.

945
00:42:29,310 --> 00:42:30,830
Alright, wait, which one is it?

946
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:31,510
Is it this one?

947
00:42:31,570 --> 00:42:32,670
Oh, it's this one, I found it.

948
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:34,990
Alright, let me move it up.

949
00:42:35,710 --> 00:42:37,290
What happened to my JP slide?

950
00:42:38,310 --> 00:42:39,890
Well, we'll never know.

951
00:42:40,970 --> 00:42:41,790
There we go.

952
00:42:42,590 --> 00:42:44,630
We're trying our best here with what we got.

953
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:45,670
There, we got it.

954
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:51,590
Wait, it's...

955
00:42:51,590 --> 00:42:52,250
Oh, there we go.

956
00:42:52,330 --> 00:42:52,830
Yeah, that's it.

957
00:42:54,230 --> 00:42:54,650
Alright.

958
00:43:22,830 --> 00:43:24,230
Alright.

959
00:43:24,870 --> 00:43:31,130
Basically, it's random, so I don't think the winning rate will change that much.

960
00:43:32,590 --> 00:43:33,890
And the prize is...

961
00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:35,130
I wonder what it is.

962
00:43:35,550 --> 00:43:40,030
It's $3, so in Japanese yen, it's about 4.65 million yen.

963
00:43:42,810 --> 00:43:43,410
30K!

964
00:43:43,850 --> 00:43:44,350
Yeah!

965
00:43:44,890 --> 00:43:45,470
30K!

966
00:43:46,070 --> 00:43:46,410
Yeah!

967
00:43:46,610 --> 00:43:47,430
Let's go!

968
00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:49,710
I was weak!

969
00:43:49,990 --> 00:43:50,510
Let's go!

970
00:43:50,730 --> 00:43:51,410
Let's go!

971
00:43:51,810 --> 00:43:52,830
Only if you win, though.

972
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:53,890
Only if you win.

973
00:43:53,890 --> 00:43:56,230
But don't worry, they all have 6 chances to win.

974
00:43:58,090 --> 00:43:58,650
Anyway...

975
00:43:59,310 --> 00:44:01,650
Alright, so, there's gonna be nerfs!

976
00:44:02,130 --> 00:44:02,510
Yes!

977
00:44:02,950 --> 00:44:03,510
Nerfs!

978
00:44:03,890 --> 00:44:05,110
So, because...

979
00:44:05,110 --> 00:44:07,010
We literally told them there's no rank limit.

980
00:44:07,150 --> 00:44:08,190
Because, like...

981
00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:10,930
The thing about NA is that...

982
00:44:10,930 --> 00:44:12,830
There's not a lot of, like...

983
00:44:12,830 --> 00:44:14,890
There's not a lot of, like...

984
00:44:16,430 --> 00:44:19,590
NA Apex VTubers that are well-known.

985
00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:21,910
Especially in the higher ELO.

986
00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:23,310
So, like...

987
00:44:23,310 --> 00:44:25,090
When you ask, like...

988
00:44:25,090 --> 00:44:26,380
People for captain spots...

989
00:44:27,890 --> 00:44:29,530
It's a lot difficult.

990
00:44:29,950 --> 00:44:30,830
Because, like...

991
00:44:30,830 --> 00:44:32,730
For them, they're like, who do I get?

992
00:44:33,770 --> 00:44:38,310
Especially if the restriction is VTubers.

993
00:44:38,870 --> 00:44:42,430
So, because of that, we were like, no rank limit.

994
00:44:42,950 --> 00:44:45,790
But, if you stack up your fucking team...

995
00:44:45,790 --> 00:44:47,990
They have a decision to stack it up or not.

996
00:44:48,430 --> 00:44:51,590
But we realized, a lot of the teams...

997
00:44:51,590 --> 00:44:54,650
They decided not to stack up their team.

998
00:44:54,770 --> 00:44:56,290
They just wanted to play for fun.

999
00:44:56,630 --> 00:44:58,670
So, because of that, we were like...

1000
00:44:59,290 --> 00:45:00,790
If you hit any...

1001
00:45:00,790 --> 00:45:03,490
If you hit master in any season...

1002
00:45:03,490 --> 00:45:04,590
Yes, there's teams that...

1003
00:45:04,590 --> 00:45:05,930
There's actually, like...

1004
00:45:05,930 --> 00:45:08,830
A team or two that doesn't really play...

1005
00:45:08,830 --> 00:45:09,970
Like, doesn't...

1006
00:45:09,970 --> 00:45:11,790
Are, like, casual Apex players.

1007
00:45:12,050 --> 00:45:13,950
So, like, they were like, we don't want a pro.

1008
00:45:14,070 --> 00:45:16,450
But they're all, like, casual Apex players.

1009
00:45:16,770 --> 00:45:19,590
So, we were like, if you fucking stack up your team...

1010
00:45:19,590 --> 00:45:23,890
And have all your team is, like, a pro and two master players...

1011
00:45:24,270 --> 00:45:26,810
We're fucking slapping you down.

1012
00:45:29,050 --> 00:45:31,970
Because we want everybody to have fun.

1013
00:45:32,390 --> 00:45:36,610
So, because of that, if you are a master plus player...

1014
00:45:37,190 --> 00:45:40,790
You're gonna have to only use one gun.

1015
00:45:41,170 --> 00:45:43,750
So, each player has one gun.

1016
00:45:44,110 --> 00:45:48,090
Because we want the more casual teams to have fun, you know?

1017
00:45:49,030 --> 00:45:53,310
So, and if game one...

1018
00:45:53,310 --> 00:45:54,830
You fucking kill half the lobby.

1019
00:45:55,010 --> 00:45:59,330
If I see a team kill, like, ten plus people...

1020
00:45:59,330 --> 00:46:04,450
Like, if one person gets, like, so many fucking kills where half the lobby is down...

1021
00:46:04,450 --> 00:46:06,650
The lobby will decide their fate.

1022
00:46:07,110 --> 00:46:09,450
So, after the games...

1023
00:46:09,450 --> 00:46:12,430
After game one, if a lobby was like...

1024
00:46:12,430 --> 00:46:13,350
We're gonna fuck...

1025
00:46:13,350 --> 00:46:17,110
We want this team to get absolutely stuffed down.

1026
00:46:17,110 --> 00:46:20,350
And then we all decide as a lobby together...

1027
00:46:20,350 --> 00:46:23,330
On what restrictions we're gonna place on them...

1028
00:46:23,330 --> 00:46:24,410
On game six.

1029
00:46:24,690 --> 00:46:26,770
So, that's how the nerfs are gonna...

1030
00:46:26,770 --> 00:46:28,230
I mean, if they win first...

1031
00:46:28,230 --> 00:46:30,970
Like, if they already won first place...

1032
00:46:30,970 --> 00:46:33,370
Like, in game six, like, at that point...

1033
00:46:33,370 --> 00:46:35,790
We all decide in game six, like, how it's gonna be.

1034
00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:36,750
So,

1035
00:46:40,630 --> 00:46:42,670
we're all gonna pass judgment.

1036
00:46:47,750 --> 00:46:50,210
Like, especially if they won...

1037
00:46:50,210 --> 00:46:52,350
And they killed the majority of the lobby...

1038
00:46:52,350 --> 00:46:53,790
We're slapping you down.

1039
00:46:56,050 --> 00:46:58,370
But it'll be affect only game six.

1040
00:46:58,430 --> 00:46:59,770
It's not like it's gonna affect every game.

1041
00:46:59,870 --> 00:47:01,130
It's just gonna be for game six.

1042
00:47:01,490 --> 00:47:01,950
So, yeah.

1043
00:47:02,070 --> 00:47:03,470
That's basically the nerf.

1044
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:05,490
Whoops.

1045
00:47:05,750 --> 00:47:07,050
Oh, that's where the rules went.

1046
00:47:07,150 --> 00:47:08,030
Where the fuck?

1047
00:47:08,370 --> 00:47:09,630
How in the... Okay, sorry.

1048
00:47:11,610 --> 00:47:14,950
I realized I named my slides wrong.

1049
00:47:18,170 --> 00:47:19,170
Sorry, Dash.

1050
00:47:19,370 --> 00:47:22,350
Let me grab the actual nerf.

1051
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:24,250
Wait, did I even saved it?

1052
00:47:24,370 --> 00:47:25,550
I must have, right?

1053
00:47:26,650 --> 00:47:27,530
Oh, no.

1054
00:47:28,250 --> 00:47:28,650
Wait.

1055
00:47:29,390 --> 00:47:30,730
Dash, can you just read off...

1056
00:47:30,730 --> 00:47:32,450
Wait, I don't have it saved.

1057
00:47:32,530 --> 00:47:33,410
I forgot to...

1058
00:47:33,410 --> 00:47:34,810
I knew I forgot one thing.

1059
00:47:35,270 --> 00:47:36,150
Wait, is it this one?

1060
00:47:36,730 --> 00:47:38,250
Wait, I can't read it.

1061
00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:39,530
No, no, no.

1062
00:47:39,650 --> 00:47:42,210
No, I got another one, but I can't read it...

1063
00:47:42,210 --> 00:47:43,390
Because it's all in Japanese.

1064
00:47:48,130 --> 00:47:49,350
Wait, is it this one?

1065
00:47:49,350 --> 00:47:50,270
I think I found it.

1066
00:47:50,310 --> 00:47:51,690
I think I found it, Dash.

1067
00:47:52,070 --> 00:47:52,950
Is it this one?

1068
00:47:53,210 --> 00:47:54,230
It's in Japanese.

1069
00:47:54,430 --> 00:47:55,070
I can't tell.

1070
00:47:55,150 --> 00:47:55,690
Is it this?

1071
00:47:56,430 --> 00:47:57,630
Come on, come on.

1072
00:47:58,190 --> 00:47:58,850
Is it this?

1073
00:48:00,590 --> 00:48:01,470
Oh, that one.

1074
00:48:01,550 --> 00:48:01,990
There we go.

1075
00:48:02,110 --> 00:48:03,250
Yeah, we did it.

1076
00:48:03,370 --> 00:48:04,810
Sorry, I can't read this.

1077
00:48:04,890 --> 00:48:07,290
This is why I have a Japanese translator.

1078
00:48:08,370 --> 00:48:09,510
Alright, there you go.

1079
00:48:11,590 --> 00:48:12,910
It's exactly why.

1080
00:48:12,910 --> 00:48:13,270
Alright.

1081
00:49:11,090 --> 00:49:12,490
Alright.

1082
00:49:21,430 --> 00:49:26,550
Yeah, thank you, bathroom translator.

1083
00:49:26,750 --> 00:49:28,090
I really appreciate it.

1084
00:49:28,470 --> 00:49:29,130
Alright, so...

1085
00:49:29,990 --> 00:49:30,990
Alright, anyway.

1086
00:49:31,330 --> 00:49:32,910
Next up, we have...

1087
00:49:34,070 --> 00:49:35,190
Match 1.

1088
00:49:35,410 --> 00:49:37,010
Alright, this is really easy.

1089
00:49:37,170 --> 00:49:38,330
Match 1, it's a regular match.

1090
00:49:38,410 --> 00:49:39,630
I don't have to talk much details.

1091
00:49:39,630 --> 00:49:41,090
It's gonna be World's Edge.

1092
00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:42,910
Toll kills do not matter.

1093
00:49:43,070 --> 00:49:44,770
It's about the end result.

1094
00:49:45,110 --> 00:49:51,650
So, whatever happens at the end, where there's one winner, that's the team that's winning $5,000.

1095
00:49:52,270 --> 00:49:54,250
And you have to divide it by three people, by the way.

1096
00:49:54,570 --> 00:49:58,250
So, like, each person gets $1,600 and a medal.

1097
00:49:58,670 --> 00:50:05,550
And the second place will get prizes that will be decided later after negotiations are over with the sponsor.

1098
00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:07,690
So, we have that.

1099
00:50:07,690 --> 00:50:13,770
Anyway, if they do too well in this match, the winner, they will get slapped in match 6.

1100
00:50:14,070 --> 00:50:15,970
So, that's what's gonna happen.

1101
00:50:16,110 --> 00:50:17,490
They're gonna get fucking slapped down.

1102
00:50:17,930 --> 00:50:21,010
Master Plus players can only carry one gun each.

1103
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:27,970
And I know somebody was like, what about the akimbo, the dual P20 and mozamb?

1104
00:50:28,090 --> 00:50:30,330
We're trying to make sure people have fun here.

1105
00:50:32,550 --> 00:50:42,290
And if you ask any Apex player if they enjoy getting shot down by dual mozambs or dual P20s, you will all get the same answer.

1106
00:50:42,470 --> 00:50:44,010
And you guys all know that answer.

1107
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:52,220
Anyway, alright, Dash.

1108
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:57,360
Dash?

1109
00:50:58,620 --> 00:50:59,500
Were you peeing?

1110
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:03,260
No, I'm not.

1111
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:06,360
I'm literally standing here.

1112
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:11,860
It's match 1.

1113
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:14,160
Alright, there we go.

1114
00:51:35,780 --> 00:51:39,440
Like I said, only one player can carry a gun.

1115
00:51:40,540 --> 00:51:48,420
And if the team is too strong, like if they are a champion or a premix, there will be restrictions on the number of guns.

1116
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:54,920
And if you win, you will receive $5000 plus medals.

1117
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:59,800
For the second place team, we are still looking at the details, but you will get a prize from the sponsor.

1118
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:02,060
Alright.

1119
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:03,960
Alright, thank you Dash.

1120
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:05,600
Alright, match 2.

1121
00:52:06,580 --> 00:52:07,440
Thank you.

1122
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:09,480
By the way guys, was he loud enough?

1123
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:13,020
I know I should have asked this when we first started having him translate.

1124
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:14,360
But is he okay?

1125
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:19,520
Is the volume okay?

1126
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:22,180
Is his volume okay guys?

1127
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:23,780
Uh, no idea.

1128
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:25,420
I don't know Japanese.

1129
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:28,320
Alright, for those who understand Japanese, he's good?

1130
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:29,620
Yeah.

1131
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:30,880
Anyway, match 2.

1132
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:32,120
It's gonna be on Stormpoint.

1133
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:34,400
It's gonna be melee abilities only.

1134
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:38,700
So, um, we're gonna have people fisting and using abilities.

1135
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:40,760
But, you cannot use grenades.

1136
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:42,240
You cannot use grenades.

1137
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:45,540
And it can't be damaging abilities or ults.

1138
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:55,980
Um, so, um, apparently, um, I didn't realize this, but Dash was like, cause he's like an Apex translator.

1139
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:58,560
He was like, what about Newcastle?

1140
00:52:58,660 --> 00:53:00,940
And I was like, what the fuck do you mean what about Newcastle?

1141
00:53:00,940 --> 00:53:02,200
Just don't use your ult.

1142
00:53:02,620 --> 00:53:04,900
But then he was like, yeah, but what about his Q?

1143
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:06,780
And I got really confused.

1144
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:08,840
I was like, what do you mean by his Q?

1145
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:11,300
You mean that mobile shield that moves around?

1146
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:22,780
And apparently, if you guys didn't, I didn't know this, but if you throw his fucking mobile shield at somebody before it lands, it does damage.

1147
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:26,300
Right, you cunt?

1148
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:28,380
I didn't know that.

1149
00:53:30,450 --> 00:53:31,610
That happened.

1150
00:53:31,950 --> 00:53:34,450
Apparently, it's been there since launch.

1151
00:53:36,030 --> 00:53:39,090
It's been there since launch.

1152
00:53:39,490 --> 00:53:42,470
So, I was like, you know what?

1153
00:53:42,890 --> 00:53:43,470
Fuck it.

1154
00:53:43,650 --> 00:53:47,470
You can play, you can use Newcastle's Q.

1155
00:53:47,870 --> 00:53:51,490
Because I think it would be really funny if you died to his shield.

1156
00:53:51,490 --> 00:53:56,550
That's really it.

1157
00:53:56,690 --> 00:53:58,650
So, I was like, that's fine.

1158
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:00,490
Just don't ult.

1159
00:54:01,210 --> 00:54:02,190
I don't care.

1160
00:54:02,290 --> 00:54:07,290
If you throw his fucking Q at people, that's pretty funny if you die from it.

1161
00:54:11,070 --> 00:54:12,710
So, Newcastle is allowed.

1162
00:54:12,830 --> 00:54:14,630
Somebody would be like, what about Bangalore's smoke?

1163
00:54:14,890 --> 00:54:16,650
You see, I thought about that too.

1164
00:54:16,950 --> 00:54:18,410
But I also got called out on that.

1165
00:54:18,450 --> 00:54:19,770
Because that was in the rules initially.

1166
00:54:19,770 --> 00:54:23,050
And Dash was like, you know they patched that out, right?

1167
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:25,970
So, for those who are like, what about Bangalore's smoke?

1168
00:54:26,090 --> 00:54:27,710
You revealed yourself today.

1169
00:54:30,170 --> 00:54:33,950
As not keeping up with the patches, just like me.

1170
00:54:36,670 --> 00:54:38,230
So, that's patched out.

1171
00:54:38,250 --> 00:54:40,290
So, you can use Bangalore's smoke too.

1172
00:54:40,750 --> 00:54:43,410
Anyway, the last surviving team is the winner.

1173
00:54:43,550 --> 00:54:44,610
And the prizes are the same.

1174
00:54:44,610 --> 00:54:47,610
5,000 divided by 3 players.

1175
00:54:48,030 --> 00:54:50,050
And medals plus second place prizes.

1176
00:54:50,630 --> 00:54:51,810
Alright, Dash, your turn.

1177
00:54:54,070 --> 00:54:55,970
Wait, why does that say King's Canyon?

1178
00:54:56,390 --> 00:54:58,090
Sorry, that's supposed to be Stormpoint.

1179
00:54:59,810 --> 00:55:00,410
Sorry.

1180
00:55:01,270 --> 00:55:03,530
That's supposed to be Stormpoint, guys.

1181
00:55:11,550 --> 00:55:14,230
Oh, that's 20?

1182
00:55:15,250 --> 00:55:16,130
Bro, what?

1183
00:55:16,350 --> 00:55:16,990
I thought it was 10.

1184
00:55:17,610 --> 00:55:22,470
In the kill feed, it shows your castle kills somebody with the mobile skill.

1185
00:55:22,930 --> 00:55:23,810
Which is kind of crazy.

1186
00:55:24,210 --> 00:55:25,190
But, yeah, okay.

1187
00:55:25,550 --> 00:55:25,750
Anyway.

1188
00:55:27,030 --> 00:55:28,030
Match 2.

1189
00:55:29,050 --> 00:55:30,330
I'm playing King's Canyon.

1190
00:55:30,730 --> 00:55:31,750
And this is Stormpoint.

1191
00:55:33,110 --> 00:55:38,710
In this match 2, only melee attacks and abilities are allowed.

1192
00:55:41,670 --> 00:55:44,390
Weapons are not allowed.

1193
00:55:44,390 --> 00:55:49,410
Only melee attacks and abilities are allowed.

1194
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:53,070
Damage is limited to abilities.

1195
00:55:53,190 --> 00:55:54,470
For example, Valkyrie's Curse.

1196
00:55:55,450 --> 00:55:57,050
Or Corsica's Curse.

1197
00:55:57,710 --> 00:55:59,810
Those are basically not allowed.

1198
00:56:01,110 --> 00:56:03,010
However, you can use Newcastle's Curse.

1199
00:56:04,310 --> 00:56:06,590
Newcastle's Curse deals 20 damage to the enemy before the shield appears.

1200
00:56:10,390 --> 00:56:12,990
You can throw it.

1201
00:56:12,990 --> 00:56:15,070
If you defeat the enemy, you can throw it.

1202
00:56:16,250 --> 00:56:17,130
However, you can't use the ultimate skill.

1203
00:56:17,670 --> 00:56:18,410
You'll get knocked back.

1204
00:56:19,090 --> 00:56:20,150
You can't use the ultimate skill.

1205
00:56:21,110 --> 00:56:22,810
And this is the same as the last match.

1206
00:56:22,990 --> 00:56:24,770
It doesn't matter how many kills you get.

1207
00:56:24,930 --> 00:56:26,830
The last survivor is the winner.

1208
00:56:27,490 --> 00:56:29,170
The prize is the same as the last match.

1209
00:56:29,830 --> 00:56:31,290
1st place is $5,000.

1210
00:56:32,150 --> 00:56:32,590
And the medal.

1211
00:56:33,570 --> 00:56:34,710
2nd place is the prize.

1212
00:56:35,630 --> 00:56:36,890
I won't tell you the details.

1213
00:56:38,090 --> 00:56:38,770
That's it.

1214
00:56:39,170 --> 00:56:39,450
Yeah!

1215
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:41,370
Thank you, Dash.

1216
00:56:41,370 --> 00:56:43,730
Time for match number 3.

1217
00:56:44,110 --> 00:56:47,130
Yes, modern problems require modern solutions, guys.

1218
00:56:47,290 --> 00:56:48,250
Thank God we're live.

1219
00:56:49,270 --> 00:56:50,170
Match 3.

1220
00:56:50,410 --> 00:56:51,350
Sniper only.

1221
00:56:52,310 --> 00:56:55,210
We're going to make sure that it's going to be on E-District.

1222
00:56:55,570 --> 00:56:57,170
The fucking land of snipers.

1223
00:56:59,910 --> 00:57:01,410
We all love E-District.

1224
00:57:01,410 --> 00:57:02,030
Anyway.

1225
00:57:07,530 --> 00:57:11,590
We're going to have it so that nobody's going to attack each other.

1226
00:57:11,890 --> 00:57:15,470
Until after the ring closes for round 1.

1227
00:57:15,730 --> 00:57:20,630
So the moment the ring hits that circle, we're fucking attacking each other.

1228
00:57:20,990 --> 00:57:22,390
So that's how it's going to go.

1229
00:57:22,470 --> 00:57:26,630
So people are going to be able to find sniper and sniper ammo in time.

1230
00:57:26,690 --> 00:57:27,550
Before it hits.

1231
00:57:28,250 --> 00:57:33,790
If you are masters plus, you're not allowed to melee anybody.

1232
00:57:34,270 --> 00:57:35,550
And can only use one sniper.

1233
00:57:36,290 --> 00:57:40,610
But, if you're below masters, you can melee.

1234
00:57:41,330 --> 00:57:46,850
Because in my head, I thought it'd be so funny if we see three people fucking...

1235
00:57:49,930 --> 00:57:59,310
I hope we would see three people run up to a sniper and just start punching.

1236
00:58:02,750 --> 00:58:07,690
So, that's why I was like, okay, that'll be really funny.

1237
00:58:12,630 --> 00:58:16,930
So, that's why, if you're masters plus, you can't do that.

1238
00:58:17,030 --> 00:58:22,090
But if you're below masters, I mean, if you have a team filled with master players.

1239
00:58:23,690 --> 00:58:26,110
You should be able to kill them, right?

1240
00:58:26,210 --> 00:58:27,390
Before they get to you.

1241
00:58:27,730 --> 00:58:29,550
Like, they're going to be running straight at you.

1242
00:58:29,650 --> 00:58:30,550
Unless they actually...

1243
00:58:30,550 --> 00:58:33,990
It'd be funny to see somebody, like three people hide in the corner.

1244
00:58:34,470 --> 00:58:37,670
Waiting for a sniper to show up and then just beat the shit out of them.

1245
00:58:37,670 --> 00:58:40,510
I thought it would be really funny.

1246
00:58:45,350 --> 00:58:46,550
But anyway.

1247
00:58:48,730 --> 00:58:51,590
But grenades are not allowed.

1248
00:58:52,090 --> 00:58:53,830
And there's no wingman.

1249
00:58:54,330 --> 00:58:56,410
And you can use the Kraber.

1250
00:58:57,110 --> 00:59:01,870
And abilities and ults can be used, but we're not allowing rampart.

1251
00:59:02,430 --> 00:59:04,650
Because, like, that's just cheating.

1252
00:59:05,690 --> 00:59:08,830
If you put your pro player on rampart.

1253
00:59:09,050 --> 00:59:13,730
Like, that's just, you know, that's just not here to have fun anymore.

1254
00:59:14,670 --> 00:59:17,210
Anyway, you can carry and use healing items.

1255
00:59:17,430 --> 00:59:19,890
And like I said, total kills do not matter.

1256
00:59:20,230 --> 00:59:22,830
And winner is the last team alive who wins champions.

1257
00:59:23,270 --> 00:59:27,530
Yes, I do have rules that I think would just be funny, okay?

1258
00:59:27,610 --> 00:59:29,270
Like, this is a content custom.

1259
00:59:29,410 --> 00:59:30,670
We're not here for that.

1260
00:59:30,870 --> 00:59:32,850
Like, it's each game is winning.

1261
00:59:36,030 --> 00:59:38,870
Each game, you have a chance to win something.

1262
00:59:39,410 --> 00:59:42,790
It's not like an overall ALGS shit.

1263
00:59:42,910 --> 00:59:47,030
I just think it's... I make rules based off of will it be funny.

1264
00:59:50,170 --> 00:59:53,890
Because, like, if anything, I could see that, like...

1265
00:59:54,270 --> 00:59:58,170
I could see, like, three people from the teams with no pros.

1266
00:59:58,290 --> 01:00:00,630
They'll just hide in a corner waiting for somebody.

1267
01:00:01,570 --> 01:00:05,010
Waiting for maybe a pro player to walk in.

1268
01:00:05,090 --> 01:00:08,970
I thought it'd be really funny if they all just started crawling on it.

1269
01:00:13,410 --> 01:00:14,010
Anyway...

1270
01:00:15,150 --> 01:00:18,230
Anyway, that is the third match.

1271
01:00:18,970 --> 01:00:19,610
Prizes are the same.

1272
01:00:19,730 --> 01:00:20,930
Prizes are the same throughout it.

1273
01:00:21,010 --> 01:00:24,970
So, 5,000 plus medals and TBD prizes.

1274
01:00:26,550 --> 01:00:28,410
Yes, Vantage is okay.

1275
01:00:28,410 --> 01:00:30,250
Bocek is not a sniper.

1276
01:00:30,690 --> 01:00:32,610
It's... We just said, yes, Kraber.

1277
01:00:34,050 --> 01:00:35,190
That's really it.

1278
01:00:35,590 --> 01:00:37,470
Alright, your turn, Dash.

1279
01:00:39,110 --> 01:00:39,430
Alright.

1280
01:00:40,770 --> 01:00:44,270
I just realized that I didn't add...

1281
01:00:44,270 --> 01:00:44,670
Oh, wait.

1282
01:00:44,710 --> 01:00:44,930
No more.

1283
01:00:45,010 --> 01:00:45,290
No more.

1284
01:00:45,410 --> 01:00:46,150
It's actually fine.

1285
01:00:46,590 --> 01:00:46,750
Okay.

1286
01:00:50,290 --> 01:00:50,850
Oh,

1287
01:00:55,290 --> 01:00:56,530
it's E-District, by the way.

1288
01:00:58,750 --> 01:00:59,250
Sorry.

1289
01:01:00,430 --> 01:01:01,410
That's my bad.

1290
01:01:01,550 --> 01:01:05,030
I forgot to change the map in the JP translation, but we'll do it live.

1291
01:01:29,310 --> 01:01:33,610
The players in E-District are not allowed to use melee attacks.

1292
01:01:34,510 --> 01:01:36,210
You can only use melee attacks on snipers.

1293
01:01:37,650 --> 01:01:40,270
However, players under Master can use melee attacks.

1294
01:01:43,230 --> 01:01:47,190
You can also surround Master players and beat them up.

1295
01:01:50,210 --> 01:01:50,690
You can't use grenades.

1296
01:01:52,550 --> 01:01:56,910
You can't use Wingman, Lampard, or Seer.

1297
01:01:59,510 --> 01:02:03,350
You can only use Kraber, Ability, and Lampard's Ultimate.

1298
01:02:04,410 --> 01:02:06,890
Other than Lampard's Ultimate, you can't use anything else.

1299
01:02:07,330 --> 01:02:07,930
You can't use Phase either.

1300
01:02:09,010 --> 01:02:09,630
You can only use Recovery.

1301
01:02:11,530 --> 01:02:13,090
It doesn't matter how many times you use it.

1302
01:02:13,690 --> 01:02:15,470
The last one you can use is the Champion.

1303
01:02:16,310 --> 01:02:19,410
The prize is $5,000 plus a medal.

1304
01:02:19,410 --> 01:02:21,890
$5,000 plus a medal.

1305
01:02:23,210 --> 01:02:44,710
$5,000 plus a medal.

1306
01:02:51,030 --> 01:02:52,850
Rules for Hiders.

1307
01:02:53,190 --> 01:02:59,610
Hiders are not allowed to hurt and damage other Hiders or Seekers.

1308
01:03:00,070 --> 01:03:04,010
There are no weapons, melees, grenades, or damaging abilities.

1309
01:03:04,930 --> 01:03:08,370
However, you can carry and use healing items.

1310
01:03:08,750 --> 01:03:10,950
The Seekers will be my team.

1311
01:03:11,310 --> 01:03:14,250
It will be me, Altair, and Jen Burden.

1312
01:03:14,830 --> 01:03:17,290
I don't think Jen is going to watch this stream.

1313
01:03:17,290 --> 01:03:21,590
When we asked, they were like, which pro do you want?

1314
01:03:21,670 --> 01:03:23,050
And I was like, how about Verhulst?

1315
01:03:23,170 --> 01:03:28,230
But I forgot because I figured it would be like a reunion.

1316
01:03:29,430 --> 01:03:32,570
But then, apparently, next week is American Thanksgiving.

1317
01:03:33,010 --> 01:03:34,390
And he's not going to be here.

1318
01:03:34,730 --> 01:03:37,550
So, I was like, let's get Jen Burden in here.

1319
01:03:38,250 --> 01:03:40,930
And I was like, alright, cool.

1320
01:03:41,190 --> 01:03:42,690
And then Tempo asked Jen.

1321
01:03:43,070 --> 01:03:45,770
Jen was like, aw man, I'm still in Australia.

1322
01:03:46,090 --> 01:03:47,050
I don't think I can do it.

1323
01:03:47,050 --> 01:03:48,730
And then, so he was like, nah.

1324
01:03:49,010 --> 01:03:52,170
And then I told Tempo, tell him it's on my team.

1325
01:03:59,050 --> 01:04:02,870
Because I was like, did you tell him it would be on my team that I requested Jen?

1326
01:04:03,410 --> 01:04:04,330
And he was like, no.

1327
01:04:04,470 --> 01:04:06,290
Alright, tell him it would be on my team.

1328
01:04:06,590 --> 01:04:09,050
And then later on, Tempo was like, yeah, Jen's going to be playing.

1329
01:04:15,670 --> 01:04:19,850
So, I'm going to fucking, I don't think he's watching this right now.

1330
01:04:19,950 --> 01:04:22,170
But on the day, I'm going to call him out on that.

1331
01:04:22,230 --> 01:04:24,170
I don't think he knows that I knew he rejected first.

1332
01:04:30,730 --> 01:04:39,230
Anyway, we are not going to be allowed to play Pathfinder, Bloodhound, Seer, Valkyrie, or Crypto.

1333
01:04:39,230 --> 01:04:45,010
And the last Hider team that survives this is going to win, basically.

1334
01:04:45,250 --> 01:04:48,430
So, like I said, these prizes are going to be for the Hiders.

1335
01:04:48,870 --> 01:04:51,650
The Seekers, we're going to have our little own competition.

1336
01:04:52,150 --> 01:04:54,630
What I'm thinking right now, I'm fucking trying to think of this live.

1337
01:04:54,990 --> 01:05:02,090
Is that Altair and I are going to compete against Jen on who is going to find the most Hiders.

1338
01:05:02,630 --> 01:05:05,710
And whoever is going to win, is going to win something.

1339
01:05:05,970 --> 01:05:08,290
Why is it Altair and I combined versus Jen?

1340
01:05:08,290 --> 01:05:10,170
Literally, he's a fucking pro player.

1341
01:05:10,290 --> 01:05:11,090
Like, what do you want?

1342
01:05:12,510 --> 01:05:14,150
What do you want from us?

1343
01:05:14,350 --> 01:05:15,470
He's literally pro.

1344
01:05:15,610 --> 01:05:17,010
We have to work together.

1345
01:05:17,270 --> 01:05:20,330
Like, we have to work together.

1346
01:05:20,830 --> 01:05:23,770
So, Altair and I, it's going to be Altair and I versus Jen.

1347
01:05:24,030 --> 01:05:25,890
And we'll see who can kill the most Hiders.

1348
01:05:28,090 --> 01:05:29,750
So, that's how it's going to be.

1349
01:05:30,370 --> 01:05:33,910
These prizes, same prizes, 5000 plus medals.

1350
01:05:34,130 --> 01:05:36,530
And then second place will be to be decided.

1351
01:05:36,530 --> 01:05:40,010
Alright, Dash.

1352
01:05:43,460 --> 01:05:45,400
Yup, yup, yup, yup.

1353
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:47,500
Okay, match 4.

1354
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,120
You got the slide?

1355
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:50,640
Yeah, it's right here.

1356
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:53,160
By the way, it says King's Canyon again, but I'm going to change it.

1357
01:05:54,840 --> 01:05:58,560
It's supposed to be Broken Moon.

1358
01:05:59,240 --> 01:06:00,060
Let's go.

1359
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:03,660
Alright, game 4.

1360
01:06:03,660 --> 01:06:04,820
So, the first game is Hide and Seek.

1361
01:06:06,540 --> 01:06:08,600
It's going to be in Broken Moon.

1362
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:16,220
In Broken Moon, the Hiding Team and the Demon Team are going to be in Team 1.

1363
01:06:16,780 --> 01:06:19,980
Team 1 is Altair, Jen, Dash, and Rokka.

1364
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:26,900
These three are going to be looking for the Hiding Team.

1365
01:06:28,540 --> 01:06:35,400
As for the Hiding Team, the Hiding Team is not allowed to attack or deal damage to other Hiding Team or Seeking Team.

1366
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:42,820
Weapons, melee attacks, grenades, damage-dealing abilities, and ultimate skills are also not allowed.

1367
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:48,380
However, you can get healing items, so you can heal and run away.

1368
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:49,860
You can also heal and run away after taking damage.

1369
01:06:53,300 --> 01:06:59,980
As for the Demon Team, you are not allowed to scan enemy characters such as Pathfinder, Bloodhound, Seer, Valkyrie, and Priestess.

1370
01:07:03,940 --> 01:07:15,460
As for the winning conditions, the winning team will receive $5,000, a medal, and a prize.

1371
01:07:16,820 --> 01:07:21,420
As for the Demon Team, as Doki just said,

1372
01:07:25,060 --> 01:07:34,580
Altair and Doki's total number of kills and Jen's total number of kills will be decided by the three of them.

1373
01:07:34,580 --> 01:07:36,320
The reason is that Jen's total number of kills is close.

1374
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:38,720
And that's about it.

1375
01:07:46,020 --> 01:07:47,460
Next slide.

1376
01:07:48,080 --> 01:07:49,360
Game 5.

1377
01:07:49,980 --> 01:07:51,480
It's not Broken Moon, guys.

1378
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:53,580
It's another E-District.

1379
01:07:54,100 --> 01:07:58,620
Because Game 5 is Protect the Princess.

1380
01:07:59,180 --> 01:08:00,380
What do you mean by that?

1381
01:08:00,740 --> 01:08:05,760
Well, basically, like I said, Master Plus players can only carry one gun.

1382
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:15,780
Pro players, if you have a pro player on your team, you will be a mandatory princess.

1383
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:17,080
Because I thought it would be funny.

1384
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:25,240
Anyway, you know, just like neuter them, basically.

1385
01:08:28,720 --> 01:08:31,720
You're like, I'm a pro, but I can't do anything.

1386
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:40,740
Anyway, so the princess cannot carry...

1387
01:08:40,740 --> 01:08:43,620
And I thought it would be funny to call them princesses too.

1388
01:08:43,860 --> 01:08:45,080
We're like, protect the princess.

1389
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:51,260
Anyway, the princess cannot carry any guns or use grenades.

1390
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:56,480
But they can carry grenades for their teammates.

1391
01:08:57,200 --> 01:09:01,700
And they can use their abilities, including damaging abilities.

1392
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:06,000
So, the princess cannot play Rampart or Vantage.

1393
01:09:06,540 --> 01:09:11,720
If the princess full dies, if they get knocked, they're fine.

1394
01:09:12,020 --> 01:09:12,900
You just revive them.

1395
01:09:13,680 --> 01:09:18,680
But if they're full killed, as in they're dead, dead, you can't revive them at all.

1396
01:09:19,020 --> 01:09:20,660
You can't rez them too, by the way.

1397
01:09:20,740 --> 01:09:22,000
No rezes are allowed.

1398
01:09:24,460 --> 01:09:29,040
So, they have to be like, full death, your fucking team's out.

1399
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:33,660
You drop all your weapons, you go W key over there with nothing.

1400
01:09:34,280 --> 01:09:35,860
Because you failed your job.

1401
01:09:36,180 --> 01:09:38,380
So, basically, total kills do not matter.

1402
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:41,180
And the winner is the last team alive, who wins champion.

1403
01:09:42,100 --> 01:09:45,460
So, yeah, that's basically protect the princess.

1404
01:09:46,100 --> 01:09:48,380
You gotta make sure your player doesn't die.

1405
01:09:48,460 --> 01:09:52,560
If you don't have a pro on your team, you can pick whoever your princess is.

1406
01:09:53,020 --> 01:09:57,700
But, if you have a designated pro player on your team, it's your pro player.

1407
01:09:57,700 --> 01:10:00,400
So, you gotta protect them, basically.

1408
01:10:02,440 --> 01:10:04,260
Alright, Dash, your turn.

1409
01:10:04,460 --> 01:10:07,700
And while you're talking... Oh, it's King's Canyon again, but it's not, by the way.

1410
01:10:11,580 --> 01:10:13,180
It's E-District.

1411
01:10:14,140 --> 01:10:16,500
It's just all King's Canyon, by the way, guys.

1412
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:18,360
It's literally just all King's Canyon.

1413
01:10:23,180 --> 01:10:26,000
If you translate this, I'm gonna...

1414
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,780
Alright, I'm kinda sure.

1415
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:57,420
If you have a designated pro player on your team, you can only use one weapon.

1416
01:11:01,900 --> 01:11:05,100
You can't do any damage to your princess.

1417
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:07,500
Basically, you can't even fly with Valkyrie.

1418
01:11:09,660 --> 01:11:15,600
If you have a team without a pro player on your team, you can pick whoever your princess is.

1419
01:11:16,220 --> 01:11:19,060
But, if you have a designated pro player on your team, you can only use one weapon.

1420
01:11:19,580 --> 01:11:21,140
So, you gotta protect the other two VTubers.

1421
01:11:21,140 --> 01:11:22,320
So, you gotta protect the other two VTubers.

1422
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:25,560
You can't even play Valkyrie with Valkyrie or Vantage.

1423
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:29,100
You can't even play Valkyrie with Valkyrie or Vantage.

1424
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:33,480
If your princess is completely defeated, the entire team is defeated.

1425
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:36,400
The reason is that you've already failed the mission.

1426
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:41,980
If your princess is completely defeated, the entire team is defeated.

1427
01:11:41,980 --> 01:11:44,800
This is also the same.

1428
01:11:45,420 --> 01:11:47,920
The last survivor is the champion.

1429
01:11:50,580 --> 01:11:53,720
The prize is $5000 and a medal.

1430
01:11:54,300 --> 01:11:56,660
The prize is sponsored by the sponsor.

1431
01:11:58,560 --> 01:11:59,500
That's it.

1432
01:12:12,020 --> 01:12:14,360
You have no power here.

1433
01:12:14,860 --> 01:12:17,480
Thank you, Dash.

1434
01:12:17,580 --> 01:12:19,240
We have one last slide.

1435
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:21,180
It's the easiest one.

1436
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:23,580
It's actually King's Canyon.

1437
01:12:24,740 --> 01:12:25,540
Finally.

1438
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:31,080
This is gonna be Launch Royale.

1439
01:12:31,220 --> 01:12:36,180
For those who don't know what Launch Royale is, it's basically Apex Season 0-1.

1440
01:12:36,700 --> 01:12:40,340
It'll be the beginning season where it all started.

1441
01:12:40,340 --> 01:12:42,540
We're actually on King's Canyon this time.

1442
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:45,260
The nerfs are in place from game 1.

1443
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:48,480
If your team gets targeted by the lobby...

1444
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:52,340
If the entire lobby was down with this team...

1445
01:12:55,160 --> 01:12:57,320
You're gonna be affected by the nerfs.

1446
01:12:57,440 --> 01:13:00,400
Like always, Masters Plus players can only carry one gun.

1447
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:03,880
Plus additional nerfs coming into place depending on what the lobby decides.

1448
01:13:05,180 --> 01:13:07,780
Yes, it is available in Custom Lobby.

1449
01:13:08,160 --> 01:13:10,000
Tempo was the one that brought it up to me.

1450
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,660
So that's why we're like, it'll be fun to end it off.

1451
01:13:12,820 --> 01:13:14,680
Bring back the memories and everything.

1452
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:17,140
Like I said, total kills do not matter.

1453
01:13:17,300 --> 01:13:19,520
And the winner is the last team alive who wins Champion.

1454
01:13:21,560 --> 01:13:23,000
Alright, Dash.

1455
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:24,800
The last translation from the bathroom.

1456
01:13:24,920 --> 01:13:26,780
And then you can cheer on your friend.

1457
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:30,180
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

1458
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:34,240
This is Game 6.

1459
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:35,920
This is the last match.

1460
01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:38,800
This rule is Launch Royale.

1461
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:42,860
If you're playing Apex, I'm sure you've already played Launch Royale.

1462
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:49,180
For those of you who don't know what it is, Launch Royale is a game mode that's currently being played in Apex.

1463
01:13:49,700 --> 01:13:52,240
In Launch Royale, you go back to Season 0.

1464
01:13:53,540 --> 01:13:55,320
All weapons, characters, etc.

1465
01:13:55,480 --> 01:13:57,140
All of them go back to their original state.

1466
01:13:58,580 --> 01:14:01,320
In this rule, you can only carry one weapon.

1467
01:14:01,320 --> 01:14:02,280
If you're a Master or above.

1468
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:05,040
You can only carry one weapon.

1469
01:14:06,340 --> 01:14:12,500
For teams that are too strong, like Match 1, there is a chance that you will be penalized by the lobby.

1470
01:14:16,680 --> 01:14:18,000
This also has nothing to do with total kills.

1471
01:14:18,820 --> 01:14:20,100
The last team to survive is the winner.

1472
01:14:21,620 --> 01:14:22,760
The prize is $5,000.

1473
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:23,940
And the medal.

1474
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:26,460
The winner will receive the prize from the sponsor.

1475
01:14:28,860 --> 01:14:29,420
Alright.

1476
01:14:31,860 --> 01:14:32,480
Yay!

1477
01:14:35,160 --> 01:14:37,120
We did it!

1478
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:38,340
Alright, Dash.

1479
01:14:38,860 --> 01:14:40,040
You can leave now.

1480
01:14:40,240 --> 01:14:43,440
Thanks for being here.

1481
01:14:43,560 --> 01:14:45,560
I really appreciate the live translation.

1482
01:14:46,620 --> 01:14:47,540
It helps a lot.

1483
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:47,800
It's fine.

1484
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:48,540
It's totally fine.

1485
01:14:49,200 --> 01:14:50,780
Call me out anytime.

1486
01:14:53,900 --> 01:14:57,660
I'm gonna make sure there's no more mistranslations this time.

1487
01:15:00,420 --> 01:15:01,460
It's okay.

1488
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:02,220
It's my fan.

1489
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:03,520
Alright, thank you.

1490
01:15:04,300 --> 01:15:05,680
Thank you, Dash.

1491
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:07,160
Alright, goodbye.

1492
01:15:07,740 --> 01:15:09,720
Say goodbye to Dash for us, guys.

1493
01:15:09,940 --> 01:15:11,420
Say goodbye to Dash, everybody.

1494
01:15:12,140 --> 01:15:14,520
He's gonna leave the bathroom now.

1495
01:15:14,980 --> 01:15:15,820
Yes, finally.

1496
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:16,940
I'm opening the door.

1497
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:18,800
Alright, bye, Dash.

1498
01:15:19,260 --> 01:15:19,500
Bye.

1499
01:15:20,820 --> 01:15:21,200
Alright.

1500
01:15:21,620 --> 01:15:22,060
Yay!

1501
01:15:22,220 --> 01:15:23,340
Thanks, Dash.

1502
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:25,040
Really appreciate it.

1503
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:26,520
Alright, anyway.

1504
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:30,640
It is time to announce the teams.

1505
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:35,800
Alright.

1506
01:15:36,940 --> 01:15:37,940
Okay, so.

1507
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:40,560
We sort of spoiled the first team already.

1508
01:15:40,820 --> 01:15:43,920
So, let me add the music back in.

1509
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:45,820
Because I didn't add the music for this one.

1510
01:15:48,240 --> 01:15:51,680
By the way, I don't know if you guys realized this.

1511
01:15:51,780 --> 01:15:56,500
It might be very obvious that I sort of came up with the team name.

1512
01:15:56,500 --> 01:15:59,380
Literally after a collab.

1513
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:05,600
Because I thought it fit very well.

1514
01:16:05,740 --> 01:16:10,160
What I was going through that day.

1515
01:16:10,740 --> 01:16:13,640
So, we are...

1516
01:16:14,020 --> 01:16:15,500
My team is...

1517
01:16:16,220 --> 01:16:17,700
The IRS.

1518
01:16:20,340 --> 01:16:26,420
So, it's gonna be me, Altair, and Jen Burton from 100 Thieves.

1519
01:16:27,180 --> 01:16:28,620
So, yeah.

1520
01:16:28,940 --> 01:16:30,180
By the way, guys.

1521
01:16:30,440 --> 01:16:32,900
Not everybody has...

1522
01:16:32,900 --> 01:16:35,240
Yes, we're here to fucking take your taxes.

1523
01:16:35,500 --> 01:16:36,840
Taxman is here now.

1524
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:41,880
The taxman is here.

1525
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:43,840
Anyway.

1526
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:46,660
What was I gonna say?

1527
01:16:48,140 --> 01:16:49,660
Oh my gosh, I lost my train of thought.

1528
01:16:49,660 --> 01:16:50,480
Okay, I remember.

1529
01:16:50,860 --> 01:16:52,320
Not everybody is gonna have a team name.

1530
01:16:53,100 --> 01:16:54,060
I told them.

1531
01:16:54,760 --> 01:16:57,820
Not everybody gave me their team name in time.

1532
01:16:58,280 --> 01:16:59,620
I didn't wanna poke them.

1533
01:17:00,720 --> 01:17:02,120
It was three strikes.

1534
01:17:02,680 --> 01:17:06,100
If I poke them three times regarding team names...

1535
01:17:06,100 --> 01:17:08,040
And I don't get a team name...

1536
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:09,600
You're not getting a team name.

1537
01:17:13,730 --> 01:17:16,150
I have other stuff to do.

1538
01:17:18,470 --> 01:17:20,370
Also, same with images.

1539
01:17:21,210 --> 01:17:22,970
For some of them, I did like...

1540
01:17:22,970 --> 01:17:24,370
Forgot to like...

1541
01:17:24,370 --> 01:17:27,370
I forgot to ask Altair for like his PNG.

1542
01:17:27,830 --> 01:17:29,410
For others, I asked every captain.

1543
01:17:30,390 --> 01:17:31,310
For key visuals.

1544
01:17:31,730 --> 01:17:34,490
If you don't give me your key visuals...

1545
01:17:34,490 --> 01:17:35,490
I get to pick.

1546
01:17:39,210 --> 01:17:41,330
I get to pick the key visuals.

1547
01:17:41,330 --> 01:17:42,870
So like...

1548
01:17:42,870 --> 01:17:44,810
That's all I'm saying.

1549
01:17:48,510 --> 01:17:50,550
Anyway, team 2.

1550
01:17:50,870 --> 01:17:52,770
We have...

1551
01:17:53,230 --> 01:17:54,470
You will see their logos.

1552
01:17:54,750 --> 01:17:56,050
What org they're from.

1553
01:17:56,150 --> 01:17:57,310
What company they're from.

1554
01:17:57,730 --> 01:17:58,710
I thought it was a nice...

1555
01:17:58,710 --> 01:18:01,810
I had somebody design all these graphics.

1556
01:18:02,270 --> 01:18:06,390
But I did decide the composition and everything.

1557
01:18:08,070 --> 01:18:08,670
So...

1558
01:18:10,790 --> 01:18:11,390
Basically...

1559
01:18:11,390 --> 01:18:13,510
I thought it was a nice touch to show...

1560
01:18:13,510 --> 01:18:14,470
Like...

1561
01:18:14,470 --> 01:18:17,490
What company they're part of and everything.

1562
01:18:17,970 --> 01:18:19,230
So we have...

1563
01:18:19,230 --> 01:18:23,150
Ditto, Amatsuki, and Yuris for team 2.

1564
01:18:23,470 --> 01:18:25,070
And their name is Team Ditto.

1565
01:18:27,570 --> 01:18:29,650
She gave me key visuals though.

1566
01:18:29,950 --> 01:18:32,210
She did give me team visuals.

1567
01:18:32,910 --> 01:18:34,490
She just didn't give me the team name.

1568
01:18:34,490 --> 01:18:35,650
So they're called Team Ditto.

1569
01:18:40,810 --> 01:18:43,650
But yes, this is team number 2.

1570
01:18:44,250 --> 01:18:44,970
Team 3.

1571
01:18:45,470 --> 01:18:46,810
We have...

1572
01:18:47,250 --> 01:18:47,970
Nasi Goren.

1573
01:18:49,550 --> 01:18:50,590
We have...

1574
01:18:50,590 --> 01:18:52,430
Akemi from Aka Virtual.

1575
01:18:52,630 --> 01:18:54,390
By the way, like I said...

1576
01:18:54,390 --> 01:18:56,090
A lot of these teams are worldwide.

1577
01:18:56,270 --> 01:18:59,450
I tried to balance it as best as I could with APAC and NA.

1578
01:18:59,670 --> 01:19:01,590
And the two EU players that slipped in.

1579
01:19:03,150 --> 01:19:04,270
We have...

1580
01:19:04,270 --> 01:19:08,270
Akemi, Fonzy, and FunFPS from NRG.

1581
01:19:08,850 --> 01:19:13,990
A lot of these are also like...

1582
01:19:13,990 --> 01:19:15,610
We tried to balance with...

1583
01:19:15,610 --> 01:19:16,830
By the way, I know...

1584
01:19:17,370 --> 01:19:18,690
We did have like...

1585
01:19:18,690 --> 01:19:19,970
We weaved some...

1586
01:19:19,970 --> 01:19:22,850
We did weave some rules.

1587
01:19:23,010 --> 01:19:25,790
I know Fonzy might not be a VTuber.

1588
01:19:26,550 --> 01:19:29,170
But they were the last minute team I literally got yesterday.

1589
01:19:29,170 --> 01:19:29,730
So...

1590
01:19:31,890 --> 01:19:33,270
I was like...

1591
01:19:33,270 --> 01:19:35,750
Thank you for clutching it Akemi.

1592
01:19:36,210 --> 01:19:37,230
Because Akemi was like...

1593
01:19:37,230 --> 01:19:38,250
Can I bring Fonzy?

1594
01:19:38,390 --> 01:19:39,230
And I was like...

1595
01:19:39,230 --> 01:19:41,530
Look, I need a team in here.

1596
01:19:43,330 --> 01:19:45,470
Yes, Fonzy the piano guy.

1597
01:19:45,970 --> 01:19:47,790
Yes, FunFPS was already here.

1598
01:19:48,350 --> 01:19:48,870
Pros...

1599
01:19:48,870 --> 01:19:50,190
Pros we did great.

1600
01:19:50,630 --> 01:19:52,850
Pros was the easiest part for some reason.

1601
01:19:53,830 --> 01:19:56,010
Except for the last JP pro.

1602
01:19:56,310 --> 01:19:58,030
Trying to find the last JP pro.

1603
01:19:58,030 --> 01:19:58,970
Because like...

1604
01:19:58,970 --> 01:20:01,750
Timing wise was all over the place.

1605
01:20:02,110 --> 01:20:03,110
But like...

1606
01:20:03,110 --> 01:20:05,070
Rest of the pros we did great.

1607
01:20:05,430 --> 01:20:06,850
But it was just...

1608
01:20:06,850 --> 01:20:08,730
Trying to coordinate the others.

1609
01:20:10,570 --> 01:20:11,170
Anyway...

1610
01:20:11,170 --> 01:20:12,670
Yes, Fonzy is a VTuber now.

1611
01:20:13,150 --> 01:20:14,750
We weaved the rule because...

1612
01:20:14,750 --> 01:20:15,670
I was like...

1613
01:20:15,670 --> 01:20:17,110
24 hours to find a team.

1614
01:20:20,150 --> 01:20:21,650
He's the piano man.

1615
01:20:21,930 --> 01:20:23,950
And we got Akemi from...

1616
01:20:23,950 --> 01:20:24,830
Aka Virtual.

1617
01:20:24,830 --> 01:20:25,550
Yeah!

1618
01:20:26,690 --> 01:20:27,890
That's team 3.

1619
01:20:28,430 --> 01:20:31,290
This is a full 20 team lobby by the way.

1620
01:20:31,370 --> 01:20:32,910
We have full 20 teams.

1621
01:20:33,570 --> 01:20:35,310
I was serious when I said...

1622
01:20:35,310 --> 01:20:36,790
We got 60 players.

1623
01:20:38,350 --> 01:20:39,550
Team 4!

1624
01:20:39,930 --> 01:20:40,910
We have...

1625
01:20:40,910 --> 01:20:42,130
Yes, team Bao.

1626
01:20:42,930 --> 01:20:45,650
Bao, Uto, and...

1627
01:20:45,650 --> 01:20:46,050
Lia.

1628
01:20:46,550 --> 01:20:47,590
From FaZe Connect.

1629
01:20:48,650 --> 01:20:51,230
Yes, we have team Bao.

1630
01:20:52,530 --> 01:20:53,990
They want to make a full VTuber team.

1631
01:20:53,990 --> 01:20:56,350
I suggested if...

1632
01:20:56,350 --> 01:20:58,450
Originally, Uto was gonna be...

1633
01:20:58,450 --> 01:21:00,090
Her own captain.

1634
01:21:00,750 --> 01:21:01,950
But then...

1635
01:21:01,950 --> 01:21:04,490
We merged...

1636
01:21:04,490 --> 01:21:06,090
It was decided early on though.

1637
01:21:06,230 --> 01:21:07,310
It wasn't like...

1638
01:21:07,310 --> 01:21:08,750
Last minute merging or everything.

1639
01:21:09,230 --> 01:21:11,230
We just thought Bao really wanted to play with Uto.

1640
01:21:11,810 --> 01:21:13,250
And I was like...

1641
01:21:13,250 --> 01:21:14,390
Uto is a captain.

1642
01:21:15,490 --> 01:21:17,850
If you guys really want to play together...

1643
01:21:17,850 --> 01:21:18,450
That's fine.

1644
01:21:18,530 --> 01:21:21,630
So Uto gave up her captain slot...

1645
01:21:21,630 --> 01:21:22,950
To play with...

1646
01:21:24,170 --> 01:21:25,430
Bao and Lia.

1647
01:21:26,490 --> 01:21:27,010
Anyway...

1648
01:21:27,010 --> 01:21:27,990
That's team 4!

1649
01:21:28,850 --> 01:21:30,090
Team 5!

1650
01:21:30,890 --> 01:21:32,050
We have...

1651
01:21:32,050 --> 01:21:35,270
ChibiDoki, Nangs, and Ruben.

1652
01:21:35,650 --> 01:21:36,210
Yes!

1653
01:21:36,370 --> 01:21:38,270
This is a one VTuber team.

1654
01:21:40,290 --> 01:21:41,130
But...

1655
01:21:41,630 --> 01:21:43,650
ChibiDoki was like...

1656
01:21:43,650 --> 01:21:45,070
Ruben can be a VTuber.

1657
01:21:45,390 --> 01:21:46,210
And I said...

1658
01:21:46,210 --> 01:21:49,690
If Ruben puts on a VTuber model...

1659
01:21:49,690 --> 01:21:52,010
He can join in.

1660
01:21:52,430 --> 01:21:53,810
Nangs is...

1661
01:21:53,810 --> 01:21:55,450
Considered the pro player on their team.

1662
01:21:55,570 --> 01:21:56,790
Because I was like...

1663
01:21:56,790 --> 01:21:59,890
Chibi really wanted these two players on her team.

1664
01:22:00,250 --> 01:22:01,170
I'm the organizer.

1665
01:22:01,610 --> 01:22:03,190
So I was just like...

1666
01:22:03,190 --> 01:22:03,950
Fuck it.

1667
01:22:05,090 --> 01:22:08,290
I made a lot of exceptions by the way guys.

1668
01:22:09,450 --> 01:22:10,030
I...

1669
01:22:10,870 --> 01:22:12,030
He was...

1670
01:22:12,030 --> 01:22:13,370
Nangs was the pro.

1671
01:22:14,190 --> 01:22:16,070
Was the pro in their team.

1672
01:22:16,330 --> 01:22:18,730
She categorized him as the pro.

1673
01:22:19,490 --> 01:22:20,750
Because I was like...

1674
01:22:20,750 --> 01:22:22,730
Either a team of 3 VTubers...

1675
01:22:23,390 --> 01:22:24,330
Or you get a pro.

1676
01:22:24,490 --> 01:22:25,390
And she was like...

1677
01:22:25,390 --> 01:22:26,430
Can Nangs be the pro?

1678
01:22:26,610 --> 01:22:27,310
And I was like...

1679
01:22:27,310 --> 01:22:27,690
Sure.

1680
01:22:28,010 --> 01:22:29,630
But you gotta get another VTuber.

1681
01:22:29,790 --> 01:22:30,490
And she was like...

1682
01:22:30,490 --> 01:22:31,490
Can I get Ruben?

1683
01:22:31,590 --> 01:22:32,290
And I was like...

1684
01:22:32,290 --> 01:22:33,390
He'll use a PNG.

1685
01:22:34,010 --> 01:22:35,250
And I was like...

1686
01:22:35,250 --> 01:22:35,730
Okay.

1687
01:22:35,730 --> 01:22:36,570
But like...

1688
01:22:36,570 --> 01:22:39,470
What about he uses a VTuber model?

1689
01:22:39,830 --> 01:22:40,790
And she was like...

1690
01:22:40,790 --> 01:22:41,130
Okay.

1691
01:22:41,610 --> 01:22:44,130
So like...

1692
01:22:44,130 --> 01:22:44,870
Yeah.

1693
01:22:49,070 --> 01:22:50,270
Good enough.

1694
01:22:53,770 --> 01:22:54,530
So...

1695
01:22:54,530 --> 01:22:55,410
Like I said...

1696
01:22:55,410 --> 01:22:57,390
Usually I just gave them cactus slots.

1697
01:22:57,450 --> 01:22:59,590
And they just get the team together.

1698
01:23:00,170 --> 01:23:02,550
So this is team number 5.

1699
01:23:02,550 --> 01:23:03,850
And we have team 6.

1700
01:23:04,170 --> 01:23:08,210
We have Billion, NecroLina, and Monsoon.

1701
01:23:09,390 --> 01:23:11,370
Trying to find a pro...

1702
01:23:11,370 --> 01:23:14,530
By the way, their team name is Katnado.

1703
01:23:15,130 --> 01:23:17,430
By the way, trying to find a pro...

1704
01:23:17,430 --> 01:23:18,550
To match...

1705
01:23:19,110 --> 01:23:20,830
The rest of this team...

1706
01:23:20,830 --> 01:23:21,990
Was very hard.

1707
01:23:22,610 --> 01:23:24,970
We had to interview a few pros...

1708
01:23:24,970 --> 01:23:26,510
To be like...

1709
01:23:27,210 --> 01:23:28,570
Who can match...

1710
01:23:29,430 --> 01:23:30,250
This team?

1711
01:23:31,230 --> 01:23:31,750
Apparently...

1712
01:23:31,750 --> 01:23:33,370
From what I was told...

1713
01:23:34,090 --> 01:23:37,690
Monsoon is known as one of the crazier pros.

1714
01:23:37,910 --> 01:23:39,190
Not like crazy crazy.

1715
01:23:39,770 --> 01:23:40,490
But like...

1716
01:23:40,490 --> 01:23:41,970
Chaotic type deal.

1717
01:23:42,130 --> 01:23:44,330
Like a lot of pros were vouching...

1718
01:23:44,330 --> 01:23:46,250
That Monsoon...

1719
01:23:46,830 --> 01:23:47,750
Can like...

1720
01:23:47,750 --> 01:23:48,830
Match their freak.

1721
01:23:49,270 --> 01:23:50,590
And that he is pretty chaotic.

1722
01:23:51,170 --> 01:23:53,130
So Monsoon is the babysitter.

1723
01:23:53,130 --> 01:23:54,530
I don't know if he is going to be the babysitter.

1724
01:23:54,850 --> 01:23:57,230
But Monsoon from Complexity...

1725
01:23:57,230 --> 01:23:59,010
Is going to be playing with...

1726
01:23:59,010 --> 01:24:01,430
Fillion and Nekrolina.

1727
01:24:01,690 --> 01:24:03,410
On team Katnado.

1728
01:24:03,650 --> 01:24:04,850
And that's team 6.

1729
01:24:06,130 --> 01:24:07,070
Team 7.

1730
01:24:07,830 --> 01:24:08,630
Representing...

1731
01:24:08,950 --> 01:24:10,350
Billy Billy side.

1732
01:24:10,650 --> 01:24:12,050
I got Hiro.

1733
01:24:12,850 --> 01:24:13,650
Nachen.

1734
01:24:14,150 --> 01:24:16,150
And LD.

1735
01:24:16,430 --> 01:24:17,850
I'm sorry, I don't know the last character.

1736
01:24:18,030 --> 01:24:18,770
It's like...

1737
01:24:18,770 --> 01:24:21,430
I can't read that character.

1738
01:24:23,590 --> 01:24:24,390
But...

1739
01:24:25,070 --> 01:24:25,670
Hiro...

1740
01:24:26,190 --> 01:24:28,250
And her team is going to be...

1741
01:24:28,250 --> 01:24:30,110
Representing on Billy Billy's team.

1742
01:24:30,290 --> 01:24:32,330
Like I said, I wanted like...

1743
01:24:32,330 --> 01:24:34,570
I wanted this custom to be...

1744
01:24:35,810 --> 01:24:36,410
Everywhere.

1745
01:24:38,390 --> 01:24:40,610
And I wanted...

1746
01:24:40,610 --> 01:24:42,670
Everybody to like...

1747
01:24:42,670 --> 01:24:44,270
A lot of places to be represented.

1748
01:24:45,170 --> 01:24:45,770
So...

1749
01:24:45,770 --> 01:24:48,850
We have Hiro's Neko Punch.

1750
01:24:48,970 --> 01:24:49,970
Is their team name.

1751
01:24:50,530 --> 01:24:52,670
I'm sorry, I can't read that character.

1752
01:24:52,670 --> 01:24:53,870
I don't know what that says.

1753
01:24:54,030 --> 01:24:56,690
My Chinese is like...

1754
01:24:56,690 --> 01:24:58,890
Primary school level when it comes to reading.

1755
01:24:59,030 --> 01:25:00,210
But I can read...

1756
01:25:00,790 --> 01:25:02,050
That's all I can remember.

1757
01:25:03,450 --> 01:25:04,830
But he is a...

1758
01:25:04,830 --> 01:25:07,150
Pro player from...

1759
01:25:07,890 --> 01:25:08,850
From APAC.

1760
01:25:09,330 --> 01:25:09,810
So...

1761
01:25:11,130 --> 01:25:12,090
More catgirls.

1762
01:25:12,090 --> 01:25:12,610
That's right.

1763
01:25:12,790 --> 01:25:16,230
It wasn't supposed to be back to back catgirls.

1764
01:25:16,310 --> 01:25:17,350
But it just...

1765
01:25:18,190 --> 01:25:19,110
Happened that way.

1766
01:25:22,670 --> 01:25:23,510
Team 8.

1767
01:25:23,650 --> 01:25:25,490
We have from Holostars.

1768
01:25:25,730 --> 01:25:27,670
We have Team Armus.

1769
01:25:28,350 --> 01:25:28,930
So...

1770
01:25:28,930 --> 01:25:30,730
We have...

1771
01:25:30,730 --> 01:25:32,750
Gerard Goldbullet.

1772
01:25:33,190 --> 01:25:35,450
And CrimsonRuse.

1773
01:25:36,450 --> 01:25:38,210
That is Team 8.

1774
01:25:38,870 --> 01:25:40,270
They were like...

1775
01:25:40,270 --> 01:25:41,510
I was asking them.

1776
01:25:41,570 --> 01:25:42,430
I was like...

1777
01:25:42,430 --> 01:25:44,430
Do you guys need a pro player?

1778
01:25:46,490 --> 01:25:48,550
Gerard asked to join this custom.

1779
01:25:48,850 --> 01:25:49,230
And I was like...

1780
01:25:49,230 --> 01:25:50,410
Yeah, no problem man.

1781
01:25:51,870 --> 01:25:53,330
And I was like...

1782
01:25:53,330 --> 01:25:54,150
Do you want a pro player?

1783
01:25:54,790 --> 01:25:56,150
And he was like...

1784
01:25:56,150 --> 01:25:57,130
No, we are not going to win.

1785
01:25:57,170 --> 01:25:58,270
We just want to have fun.

1786
01:25:58,630 --> 01:25:59,570
And I was like...

1787
01:25:59,570 --> 01:26:00,850
Good for you.

1788
01:26:06,890 --> 01:26:07,450
So...

1789
01:26:07,450 --> 01:26:09,230
We have...

1790
01:26:10,470 --> 01:26:11,590
Gerard Goldbullet.

1791
01:26:11,630 --> 01:26:12,410
And CrimsonRuse.

1792
01:26:12,510 --> 01:26:14,450
In here on Team 8.

1793
01:26:16,110 --> 01:26:17,230
From Holostars.

1794
01:26:18,190 --> 01:26:19,390
Next up...

1795
01:26:19,390 --> 01:26:21,010
We have Team Kuro.

1796
01:26:21,850 --> 01:26:23,170
Ah yes, you see...

1797
01:26:23,170 --> 01:26:24,550
Our first...

1798
01:26:25,230 --> 01:26:26,550
One of our first...

1799
01:26:26,550 --> 01:26:27,450
Not first star.

1800
01:26:27,490 --> 01:26:29,650
We have a lot of rules exception here.

1801
01:26:32,250 --> 01:26:32,890
But...

1802
01:26:32,890 --> 01:26:35,490
We have Kuro and Michi.

1803
01:26:35,710 --> 01:26:36,670
From Vshojo.

1804
01:26:37,250 --> 01:26:38,450
And IPN.

1805
01:26:38,750 --> 01:26:41,070
The guy that is going to play on 300 ping.

1806
01:26:41,510 --> 01:26:42,730
And said he will be okay.

1807
01:26:42,850 --> 01:26:44,310
If this guy complains...

1808
01:26:44,310 --> 01:26:45,590
About the ping.

1809
01:26:50,450 --> 01:26:51,410
Anyway...

1810
01:26:51,410 --> 01:26:53,650
This is Team 9.

1811
01:26:54,770 --> 01:26:57,470
With Kuro, Michi and IPN.

1812
01:26:58,250 --> 01:26:59,890
Alright, Team 10.

1813
01:27:01,210 --> 01:27:02,130
We have...

1814
01:27:02,130 --> 01:27:03,250
Team FaZe Connect.

1815
01:27:03,910 --> 01:27:06,350
We have representing FaZe Connect.

1816
01:27:06,830 --> 01:27:07,830
We have...

1817
01:27:07,830 --> 01:27:09,650
Lumi and Ember.

1818
01:27:10,150 --> 01:27:12,310
And we got...

1819
01:27:12,310 --> 01:27:12,990
Lulu Lovely.

1820
01:27:13,290 --> 01:27:15,170
For those who don't know who Lulu Lovely is.

1821
01:27:15,250 --> 01:27:18,530
Lulu is very well known in the NA Apex scene.

1822
01:27:20,630 --> 01:27:21,670
She is...

1823
01:27:21,670 --> 01:27:24,350
She actually has her own gun skin in Apex.

1824
01:27:24,450 --> 01:27:24,810
If you don't know.

1825
01:27:24,890 --> 01:27:27,530
She is one of the most well known female players within NA.

1826
01:27:29,590 --> 01:27:30,110
And...

1827
01:27:30,110 --> 01:27:31,450
It was great to...

1828
01:27:31,450 --> 01:27:34,030
That she was open to joining this custom.

1829
01:27:34,950 --> 01:27:36,650
It was great about it.

1830
01:27:37,190 --> 01:27:37,710
Anyway...

1831
01:27:38,210 --> 01:27:40,350
Yes, Lulu will be on this team.

1832
01:27:40,350 --> 01:27:42,530
We assigned her to this team.

1833
01:27:43,930 --> 01:27:46,010
Alright, next up.

1834
01:27:46,150 --> 01:27:47,250
Team 11.

1835
01:27:49,230 --> 01:27:50,650
We have...

1836
01:27:50,650 --> 01:27:52,250
Kohaku's team.

1837
01:27:52,650 --> 01:27:54,050
So, we have Kohaku.

1838
01:27:54,390 --> 01:27:56,250
From Project Kawaii.

1839
01:27:56,470 --> 01:27:58,270
And she brought in...

1840
01:27:58,270 --> 01:27:59,350
Shiosaki.

1841
01:27:59,930 --> 01:28:02,630
And also, we have a Japanese pro.

1842
01:28:03,770 --> 01:28:05,110
His name is...

1843
01:28:05,110 --> 01:28:05,590
Sisu.

1844
01:28:06,530 --> 01:28:08,930
I can't remember what team he is from.

1845
01:28:08,930 --> 01:28:11,810
Dash helped us in getting him.

1846
01:28:11,930 --> 01:28:13,110
He is from XFC.

1847
01:28:13,490 --> 01:28:14,350
So, X Factor.

1848
01:28:14,830 --> 01:28:15,550
In Japan.

1849
01:28:16,190 --> 01:28:17,770
So, yes.

1850
01:28:18,010 --> 01:28:19,770
This is team 11.

1851
01:28:20,370 --> 01:28:23,310
Kohaku really wanted to play with a...

1852
01:28:23,310 --> 01:28:24,410
JP pro.

1853
01:28:24,850 --> 01:28:27,090
And we are happy to be able to...

1854
01:28:27,090 --> 01:28:28,150
Get the...

1855
01:28:28,150 --> 01:28:29,990
Get Sisu for them.

1856
01:28:30,430 --> 01:28:31,070
So, yes.

1857
01:28:31,130 --> 01:28:32,370
This is team 11.

1858
01:28:33,030 --> 01:28:33,690
Team 11.

1859
01:28:34,690 --> 01:28:35,850
Team 12.

1860
01:28:35,850 --> 01:28:38,270
We have...

1861
01:28:38,270 --> 01:28:39,610
Team Monster Lovers.

1862
01:28:39,950 --> 01:28:42,030
So, in Monster Lovers, we have...

1863
01:28:42,610 --> 01:28:43,270
Amelie.

1864
01:28:43,450 --> 01:28:45,670
And her friend, Miss Shadow Lovely.

1865
01:28:46,150 --> 01:28:47,630
And then, we assigned...

1866
01:28:47,630 --> 01:28:48,490
Albert Lele.

1867
01:28:48,850 --> 01:28:51,290
Who is also a VTuber now.

1868
01:28:51,790 --> 01:28:54,150
So, I couldn't find...

1869
01:28:54,150 --> 01:28:55,470
By the way...

1870
01:28:55,470 --> 01:28:57,850
This is me Googling their images.

1871
01:28:58,510 --> 01:28:59,170
And...

1872
01:28:59,170 --> 01:29:01,710
Mac does not have his...

1873
01:29:01,710 --> 01:29:03,830
I was tempted to just...

1874
01:29:03,830 --> 01:29:05,950
Go find his stream and then screenshot it.

1875
01:29:06,030 --> 01:29:07,730
Because I can't find it on...

1876
01:29:07,730 --> 01:29:09,870
Like, I couldn't find it on Google.

1877
01:29:10,270 --> 01:29:12,390
But like, he did post his reference sheet.

1878
01:29:12,510 --> 01:29:13,270
Which was great.

1879
01:29:13,670 --> 01:29:15,910
But I was so disclosed...

1880
01:29:15,910 --> 01:29:18,570
To just go to his stream and screenshot a picture of him.

1881
01:29:18,670 --> 01:29:21,330
Because you cannot find his VTuber model anywhere.

1882
01:29:23,770 --> 01:29:25,170
Like, not on Google.

1883
01:29:26,670 --> 01:29:28,330
Not on Google Images.

1884
01:29:29,390 --> 01:29:29,910
So...

1885
01:29:30,730 --> 01:29:31,250
Anyway.

1886
01:29:31,250 --> 01:29:33,430
So that is Team Monster Lovers.

1887
01:29:34,570 --> 01:29:36,010
Of Amelie, Miss Shadow Lovely...

1888
01:29:36,010 --> 01:29:36,590
And Albert Lele.

1889
01:29:37,170 --> 01:29:39,250
Next up, we have...

1890
01:29:40,590 --> 01:29:41,110
Uh...

1891
01:29:41,110 --> 01:29:41,850
Melizande.

1892
01:29:43,290 --> 01:29:44,330
We have...

1893
01:29:44,330 --> 01:29:46,650
For those who don't know who Meli is...

1894
01:29:46,650 --> 01:29:48,210
I'm sorry if I'm pronouncing your name wrong.

1895
01:29:48,570 --> 01:29:49,090
Melizande.

1896
01:29:51,510 --> 01:29:53,390
I think one of them worked.

1897
01:29:53,470 --> 01:29:55,110
I'm really sorry if I pronounced it wrong.

1898
01:29:55,150 --> 01:29:56,550
But if you guys don't know...

1899
01:29:57,210 --> 01:29:59,690
She is the voice actress...

1900
01:29:59,690 --> 01:30:00,690
For Catalyst.

1901
01:30:01,270 --> 01:30:03,910
So for those in JP...

1902
01:30:03,910 --> 01:30:05,690
She plays Catalyst.

1903
01:30:05,890 --> 01:30:07,330
Yes, she's in our custom.

1904
01:30:09,030 --> 01:30:12,690
LOL Yeah, so...

1905
01:30:13,690 --> 01:30:14,710
And then...

1906
01:30:14,710 --> 01:30:16,750
Her teammate is Prisma.

1907
01:30:17,290 --> 01:30:19,910
And the assigned pro is...

1908
01:30:19,910 --> 01:30:21,870
I'm Madness from Furia.

1909
01:30:22,490 --> 01:30:24,250
That is their pro player.

1910
01:30:24,290 --> 01:30:25,890
That was assigned to them.

1911
01:30:26,470 --> 01:30:26,870
Um...

1912
01:30:27,690 --> 01:30:29,790
By the way, for the pro assignments...

1913
01:30:29,790 --> 01:30:30,570
Um...

1914
01:30:30,570 --> 01:30:32,930
We basically try to cater to what they requested.

1915
01:30:33,330 --> 01:30:36,350
So, when we gave them the captain slot...

1916
01:30:36,350 --> 01:30:37,890
We'd be like, which pro would you like?

1917
01:30:38,090 --> 01:30:39,730
Some of them requested no pros.

1918
01:30:39,810 --> 01:30:40,850
We were like, do you want a pro?

1919
01:30:40,950 --> 01:30:42,170
You don't have to have a pro.

1920
01:30:42,370 --> 01:30:43,950
You can just have three Vtubers.

1921
01:30:44,290 --> 01:30:45,710
Or choose a friend.

1922
01:30:45,850 --> 01:30:47,110
And we're like, that's fine.

1923
01:30:47,510 --> 01:30:50,030
And some choose to have a pro assigned.

1924
01:30:50,390 --> 01:30:52,210
And some have specific requests.

1925
01:30:52,210 --> 01:30:54,570
Others might not have any requests at all.

1926
01:30:54,630 --> 01:30:55,970
So we could get any pro we want.

1927
01:30:56,230 --> 01:30:56,750
Um...

1928
01:30:56,750 --> 01:30:59,010
So that's basically how the whole thing worked.

1929
01:30:59,970 --> 01:31:02,030
But yeah, that is...

1930
01:31:02,030 --> 01:31:03,290
Team 13.

1931
01:31:04,190 --> 01:31:05,350
Team 14.

1932
01:31:05,750 --> 01:31:07,930
We have Nia's team.

1933
01:31:08,090 --> 01:31:09,370
Nia Mokcha's team.

1934
01:31:09,690 --> 01:31:10,550
Team 14.

1935
01:31:10,770 --> 01:31:13,490
So, we have Nia and Annie.

1936
01:31:13,870 --> 01:31:16,110
And Nocturno from NRG.

1937
01:31:16,850 --> 01:31:17,490
Um...

1938
01:31:17,490 --> 01:31:18,770
Huge shoutout to Annie.

1939
01:31:18,770 --> 01:31:25,050
Annie was literally the person we got an hour before the stream started.

1940
01:31:29,290 --> 01:31:30,050
Um...

1941
01:31:30,050 --> 01:31:34,530
She was down to join as an emergency backup.

1942
01:31:35,150 --> 01:31:36,230
So, um...

1943
01:31:36,230 --> 01:31:43,330
Huge shoutout to Annie for wanting to join the custom and wanting to be part of it and everything.

1944
01:31:44,630 --> 01:31:45,450
Really great.

1945
01:31:45,450 --> 01:31:46,710
Um...

1946
01:31:46,710 --> 01:31:49,870
But yes, this is team 14.

1947
01:31:50,430 --> 01:31:51,550
That we have here.

1948
01:31:53,470 --> 01:31:54,190
Um...

1949
01:31:54,190 --> 01:31:55,530
Anyway...

1950
01:31:55,530 --> 01:31:56,870
Team 15.

1951
01:31:57,230 --> 01:31:59,510
We have Restia's team.

1952
01:31:59,690 --> 01:32:02,350
In Restia's team, we have Restia.

1953
01:32:03,270 --> 01:32:03,630
KSP.

1954
01:32:04,790 --> 01:32:08,970
And I'm really sorry, but can anybody tell me how to pronounce this name?

1955
01:32:09,210 --> 01:32:11,610
I was very scared of pronouncing it wrong.

1956
01:32:16,050 --> 01:32:16,610
Um...

1957
01:32:16,610 --> 01:32:16,790
Um...

1958
01:32:16,790 --> 01:32:18,330
Yes, Restia, the cat girl.

1959
01:32:18,730 --> 01:32:19,290
Hakuzen?

1960
01:32:19,870 --> 01:32:20,430
Hakuzen.

1961
01:32:20,530 --> 01:32:23,710
So it's Restia, KSP, and Hakuzen.

1962
01:32:24,530 --> 01:32:25,950
Um... for team 15.

1963
01:32:26,190 --> 01:32:26,830
Thank you guys.

1964
01:32:26,950 --> 01:32:30,130
I'm really happy that people here actually knows how to read compared to me.

1965
01:32:30,370 --> 01:32:31,630
Um... thank you so much.

1966
01:32:31,670 --> 01:32:32,590
I appreciate it.

1967
01:32:32,850 --> 01:32:33,150
Um...

1968
01:32:33,150 --> 01:32:35,210
But yes, we have Restia's team.

1969
01:32:35,490 --> 01:32:36,690
Team 16.

1970
01:32:37,930 --> 01:32:39,870
We have RPR.

1971
01:32:40,710 --> 01:32:47,030
Um... RPR with Kewpie and Tsuna from VSPO-JP.

1972
01:32:47,410 --> 01:32:49,130
Will be joining us.

1973
01:32:49,530 --> 01:32:52,390
This is RPR's team, guys.

1974
01:32:53,490 --> 01:32:54,930
There's not a lot of team names.

1975
01:32:56,810 --> 01:32:57,490
There's...

1976
01:32:57,490 --> 01:33:01,870
I just need you guys to know that we...

1977
01:33:01,870 --> 01:33:04,110
Not a lot of people gave us team names.

1978
01:33:07,630 --> 01:33:08,310
So...

1979
01:33:08,310 --> 01:33:09,890
It's just a captain's name.

1980
01:33:13,150 --> 01:33:13,830
So...

1981
01:33:13,830 --> 01:33:15,730
You guys are saying this is gonna be a stack team.

1982
01:33:15,910 --> 01:33:17,610
Remember, we have nerves here.

1983
01:33:21,370 --> 01:33:22,050
Alright.

1984
01:33:22,650 --> 01:33:23,710
Team 17.

1985
01:33:24,370 --> 01:33:26,510
We have Sakuno's team.

1986
01:33:26,990 --> 01:33:32,730
So we have Sakuno, Miss Doctor, and it's Timmy.

1987
01:33:32,730 --> 01:33:37,090
Yes, we got Timmy here from 100 Thieves.

1988
01:33:37,270 --> 01:33:37,690
Yes.

1989
01:33:38,250 --> 01:33:39,170
Timmy's gonna be playing.

1990
01:33:39,670 --> 01:33:46,210
Guys, you guys should know we had so many people request Timmy.

1991
01:33:50,450 --> 01:33:51,250
We're sorry.

1992
01:33:51,650 --> 01:33:56,410
If we could split Timmy into 10 different teams, we could.

1993
01:33:56,730 --> 01:33:59,990
But sadly, we had to...

1994
01:34:00,870 --> 01:34:04,910
Sadly, we can only assign him to one team.

1995
01:34:08,350 --> 01:34:09,870
But yes.

1996
01:34:10,430 --> 01:34:11,650
We have...

1997
01:34:11,650 --> 01:34:12,510
It's Timmy.

1998
01:34:13,070 --> 01:34:20,410
I thought it was funny because apparently there's a thing where people always confuse between Sakuno and Timmy.

1999
01:34:20,570 --> 01:34:21,830
They think they're the same person.

2000
01:34:22,730 --> 01:34:22,990
So...

2001
01:34:23,990 --> 01:34:25,830
So that's why...

2002
01:34:25,830 --> 01:34:27,890
There's also...

2003
01:34:27,890 --> 01:34:29,250
It was requested as well.

2004
01:34:29,870 --> 01:34:32,010
Well, he requested Nice Wig.

2005
01:34:32,490 --> 01:34:34,690
And I was like, Nice Wig's fucking casting.

2006
01:34:37,630 --> 01:34:39,710
So I was like, I'm sorry, Sakuno.

2007
01:34:40,110 --> 01:34:42,510
I can't get you, Nice Wig.

2008
01:34:43,970 --> 01:34:45,150
But yes, anyway.

2009
01:34:46,390 --> 01:34:49,430
This is Sakuno's team for Team 17.

2010
01:34:51,610 --> 01:34:52,690
Team 18!

2011
01:34:53,510 --> 01:34:55,870
Yes, we have the entire 100 Thieves roster.

2012
01:34:55,870 --> 01:35:02,190
Guys, like me, it really is beneficial when you have your best friends with Nice Wig.

2013
01:35:04,230 --> 01:35:06,090
When you're besties.

2014
01:35:07,670 --> 01:35:11,630
But we have basically the entire 100 Thieves roster in here.

2015
01:35:12,110 --> 01:35:13,750
We have...

2016
01:35:13,750 --> 01:35:17,030
Tenjin and his friend Reruzenski.

2017
01:35:17,610 --> 01:35:18,950
And Designful.

2018
01:35:20,370 --> 01:35:22,350
That from 100 Thieves.

2019
01:35:22,350 --> 01:35:25,670
And they are called The Fools.

2020
01:35:26,170 --> 01:35:27,190
For Team 18.

2021
01:35:27,990 --> 01:35:30,470
Oh, last two teams, guys.

2022
01:35:30,750 --> 01:35:32,930
Last two teams are left.

2023
01:35:33,430 --> 01:35:34,290
Team 19!

2024
01:35:35,330 --> 01:35:36,390
Team 19!

2025
01:35:36,950 --> 01:35:40,010
We have Tsukumo's team.

2026
01:35:40,450 --> 01:35:42,850
Yes, we also got reps in here!

2027
01:35:43,070 --> 01:35:45,630
So TSM is part of this custom.

2028
01:35:46,350 --> 01:35:47,790
And we have...

2029
01:35:47,790 --> 01:35:50,710
From Neoport, we have...

2030
01:35:50,710 --> 01:35:52,410
Three Kohakus, by the way, I realized.

2031
01:35:52,990 --> 01:35:58,870
I think we have like three different Kohakus in this custom alone.

2032
01:35:59,250 --> 01:36:10,590
So we have Tsukumo from Neoport, Kohaku from Sony V, and we have reps from TSM.

2033
01:36:11,330 --> 01:36:13,810
Tsukumo requested...

2034
01:36:13,810 --> 01:36:14,710
It was from the forum.

2035
01:36:16,250 --> 01:36:21,110
They requested Hal, Timmy,

2036
01:36:24,810 --> 01:36:30,890
but we couldn't get Hal, and we couldn't cut up Timmy into 10 parts.

2037
01:36:33,250 --> 01:36:36,330
Hal was unfortunately busy on that day.

2038
01:36:37,330 --> 01:36:39,850
We don't want to cut up Timmy into 10 parts.

2039
01:36:40,990 --> 01:36:42,930
So we were like, what about reps?

2040
01:36:44,090 --> 01:36:47,070
And at first we were like, are you sure?

2041
01:36:47,730 --> 01:36:52,590
Because like, will you be okay with communicating with like an NA pro?

2042
01:36:52,870 --> 01:36:55,410
And they were like, we really want to play with an NA pro.

2043
01:36:55,650 --> 01:37:00,510
Because we were like, we could get you JP, and they were like, no, we really want an NA pro, and we're like, okay.

2044
01:37:01,850 --> 01:37:03,290
And I was like, how's communication?

2045
01:37:03,810 --> 01:37:06,870
And then they were like, the management...

2046
01:37:06,870 --> 01:37:13,810
Because we were talking to the manager, and then the manager was like, oh, yo, I'm a pro, why am I?

2047
01:37:13,850 --> 01:37:15,970
You gotta run the server, Tempo!

2048
01:37:20,090 --> 01:37:22,650
And yeah, they were like, we have passion.

2049
01:37:23,390 --> 01:37:25,870
And then I was like, you know what, that's good enough.

2050
01:37:29,370 --> 01:37:31,670
They really wanted an NA pro.

2051
01:37:32,730 --> 01:37:35,450
So, and we had reps, too.

2052
01:37:35,590 --> 01:37:49,490
So, we had reps on standby, we haven't assigned reps yet, and they both, they really wanted an NA professional player, so we assigned them reps, because good luck, reps.

2053
01:37:49,910 --> 01:37:57,350
I hope you enjoy, I hope you get to, I cannot wait for you to experience the passion.

2054
01:37:57,710 --> 01:37:58,570
It's actually really fun.

2055
01:37:58,950 --> 01:38:04,670
I love playing with passion English, because it's like, actually a really fun experience.

2056
01:38:05,470 --> 01:38:09,130
But yes, it's gonna be really interesting how they communicate together.

2057
01:38:10,630 --> 01:38:13,130
Yeah, so yeah, good luck, reps.

2058
01:38:13,830 --> 01:38:14,910
It'll be really fun to see.

2059
01:38:16,030 --> 01:38:18,790
So yes, this is team 19.

2060
01:38:19,550 --> 01:38:20,150
Finally!

2061
01:38:20,610 --> 01:38:22,850
The final team.

2062
01:38:23,830 --> 01:38:28,430
It will be Aoharu.

2063
01:38:29,430 --> 01:38:32,710
We have Kohaku, another Kohaku, by the way.

2064
01:38:32,810 --> 01:38:34,530
Remember I said we had three Kohakus?

2065
01:38:34,530 --> 01:38:36,550
Like, this is the third Kohaku.

2066
01:38:36,970 --> 01:38:45,790
We have Kohaku Tito from Neoport, Aoharu from Realize, and we have one Tappy, my fucking favorite pro player!

2067
01:38:48,680 --> 01:38:50,700
I was so happy that we got Tappy.

2068
01:38:51,120 --> 01:38:53,200
I was so fucking happy.

2069
01:38:54,460 --> 01:38:58,280
Literally, I was like, bro, we could get Tappy in here?

2070
01:38:58,820 --> 01:39:00,960
My day is fucking made.

2071
01:39:05,460 --> 01:39:13,600
From the very first time we spectated Tappy and, like, rigged the votes to get him voted as, like, MVP.

2072
01:39:13,960 --> 01:39:16,400
We tried to rig the votes and it would never happen.

2073
01:39:16,520 --> 01:39:17,920
I was so upset by that.

2074
01:39:18,060 --> 01:39:28,020
I don't know if you guys remembered, but one of the ALGS watchalongs, we can rig the votes to be, like, use the hashtag to tell people who your favorite who's the MVP pro is.

2075
01:39:28,440 --> 01:39:30,860
And then all the dragoons kept voting for Tappy.

2076
01:39:30,860 --> 01:39:35,040
And then we found out they don't even look at that hashtag.

2077
01:39:37,900 --> 01:39:47,080
That's when we found out it was fucking rigged because the entire hashtag was just us voting for Tappy.

2078
01:39:50,500 --> 01:39:56,200
So, I'm so happy that we managed to get Tappy in here.

2079
01:39:56,980 --> 01:40:01,840
Huge shoutout to Dash for getting Tappy in.

2080
01:40:02,200 --> 01:40:10,180
We had, like, one day to find some JP pros because the JP pros weren't able to do the scheduling.

2081
01:40:10,780 --> 01:40:12,680
So they had to, like, drop out, do the scheduling.

2082
01:40:12,900 --> 01:40:14,340
So we were like, who do we get?

2083
01:40:14,840 --> 01:40:17,000
And then Dash was like, wait, I know Tappy.

2084
01:40:17,200 --> 01:40:19,100
And I was like, fucking get him!

2085
01:40:22,440 --> 01:40:24,280
We have to get him!

2086
01:40:26,860 --> 01:40:33,180
So, I'm super happy that, you know, it feels like a circle.

2087
01:40:33,980 --> 01:40:38,560
We spectated Tappy in ALGS and now he's part of my custom.

2088
01:40:39,100 --> 01:40:43,960
So it feels like, you know, we all made it here.

2089
01:40:48,540 --> 01:40:58,840
But yes, that is all 20 teams for those who wanted to see, I'll just scroll past all the teams real quick for all of you guys.

2090
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:03,320
So we have a lot of pros, a lot of players all around the world.

2091
01:41:03,480 --> 01:41:12,820
A lot of different pro players, a lot of different VTubers from different backgrounds, from different regions, different skill levels, indie, corporate.

2092
01:41:13,640 --> 01:41:21,100
It was very, okay, so I'll talk about this real quick while we get to the end real quick though.

2093
01:41:23,880 --> 01:41:27,480
While we make it to the end of this here.

2094
01:41:27,900 --> 01:41:34,180
Let me go back to the chatting screen real fast.

2095
01:41:35,440 --> 01:41:46,140
Alright, so if you're like wondering, oh, why isn't this person or why isn't that person or why isn't this VTuber in here?

2096
01:41:46,300 --> 01:41:49,800
Why isn't this VTuber from this company not part of the custom?

2097
01:41:50,320 --> 01:41:54,380
Or this VTuber from this other smaller VTuber company not in this custom?

2098
01:41:55,560 --> 01:41:56,820
It's very simple.

2099
01:41:57,580 --> 01:42:01,340
They didn't apply or ask to be invited most likely.

2100
01:42:01,860 --> 01:42:11,340
Because regarding like smaller companies, I did try to I did try to like allow, not allow, sorry.

2101
01:42:11,420 --> 01:42:12,300
That's not the right word.

2102
01:42:12,580 --> 01:42:24,420
Include them in and like majority of the small, like, I think I invited all the smaller VTuber companies that wanted to be a part of the custom.

2103
01:42:25,160 --> 01:42:26,760
To be part of it.

2104
01:42:27,600 --> 01:42:29,760
And why VTubers?

2105
01:42:30,680 --> 01:42:33,840
This is a VTuber custom.

2106
01:42:37,080 --> 01:42:46,280
So, and also, I wanted to make sure we balanced out NA and APAC plus the two EU players that slipped in.

2107
01:42:46,280 --> 01:42:46,780
Oh.

2108
01:42:48,380 --> 01:42:58,300
So, we try to balance, make sure that the NA players and APAC players is not like one is more NA over the other.

2109
01:42:58,540 --> 01:43:14,000
We try to like make sure there is a balance because it is the main reason why I'm organizing this is to celebrate the fact that LGS is in is in Japan this, or next year in 2025.

2110
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:19,220
And I know I was also very lenient regarding players too.

2111
01:43:20,140 --> 01:43:39,080
And basically this is really really it was very hard balancing it because if somebody dropped out, I try to find a team or a person that like matches the person that couldn't play it or wasn't allowed to play it.

2112
01:43:39,140 --> 01:43:46,060
So like, I try to match people up to be similar just so it would be balanced.

2113
01:43:47,280 --> 01:43:49,560
In terms of what it is.

2114
01:43:50,580 --> 01:44:07,920
This is like a pilot episode and it was very, like I said anything that could happen, anything that fucked up like stuff that would mess with organizing this did happen.

2115
01:44:08,700 --> 01:44:11,320
So, it was very stressful.

2116
01:44:18,520 --> 01:44:26,160
And basically like I'm hoping, when a pilot costs $30,000 I know a lot of people are like, that's a lot of money.

2117
01:44:26,440 --> 01:44:32,500
The thing is, the first event is also like one of the most important events to kickstart something.

2118
01:44:32,880 --> 01:45:04,880
Like I might invest $30,000 on it now, but in the future maybe it will attract sponsors that want to you know, sponsor these events more and then be able to provide something similar or be able to organize these without having to use my own money and being able to provide people like a chance being able to provide people like a chance to get something out of it being able to get prizes out of it,

2119
01:45:04,960 --> 01:45:14,020
get memorabilia out of it Like it's an investment on something I really want to do in the future regarding planning more events similar to this.

2120
01:45:14,560 --> 01:45:19,080
And this doesn't mean like every event I'm going to do has a fucking insane type of prize money.

2121
01:45:19,740 --> 01:45:44,340
This is also because due to some players that are involved obviously it's more so of like, you know I have to establish something here and this is like me establishing like a custom that I want to try and organize and potentially do more of these in the future and being able to do more types of events similar to these in the future.

2122
01:45:44,800 --> 01:46:11,900
But, uh, and anyway for more VTuber-centric events, uh, this is like my first time doing like a competitive ish VTuber event but also making sure that there is a balance in between like the fun and game modes and the more like fun game modes and as well as like pew pew pew pew So,

2123
01:46:11,900 --> 01:46:17,500
um, it was just to, um, it's like an experiment, uh, per se.

2124
01:46:17,740 --> 01:46:23,540
It's definitely like an experiment on like a more competitive side because we don't get that a lot in NA as well.

2125
01:46:23,840 --> 01:46:37,260
If I try to organize like, um, if I try to organize it specifically in, um, NA, uh, um, it's a lot harder.

2126
01:46:39,640 --> 01:46:48,180
Because we don't get a lot of these like, uh, events, um, within like NA type deal.

2127
01:46:48,520 --> 01:46:52,540
So, this is more so of a way to experiment and see what we can do.

2128
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:53,120
Yeah.

2129
01:46:54,600 --> 01:46:59,020
Especially if we're like, you know, like, look, I didn't say it guys.

2130
01:46:59,300 --> 01:47:00,580
I didn't say it.

2131
01:47:00,700 --> 01:47:05,380
Literally, I was screaming into our DMs being like, how the fuck do you do this?

2132
01:47:05,480 --> 01:47:08,940
And then Tempo was like, like, it's Apex players.

2133
01:47:12,500 --> 01:47:14,580
He's just like, you get used to it.

2134
01:47:15,300 --> 01:47:22,580
And I was just like screaming into the void being like, this is the hardest thing I've ever fucking done!

2135
01:47:27,750 --> 01:47:30,230
And he was like, you'll get used to it.

2136
01:47:30,250 --> 01:47:32,710
And I was like, I DON'T WANNA GET USED TO IT!

2137
01:47:35,090 --> 01:47:40,590
I've never, oh my god, I've never been so frustrated before organizing an event.

2138
01:47:41,110 --> 01:47:47,430
Like, the amount of things I went through the last two weeks, I was screaming at it.

2139
01:47:53,610 --> 01:47:57,470
But yes, it is a...

2140
01:47:57,470 --> 01:48:03,650
Um, this is basically, this is a trial run of sorts.

2141
01:48:03,910 --> 01:48:07,470
And, you know, like I said, there is, like, uh...

2142
01:48:08,690 --> 01:48:09,170
Uh...

2143
01:48:09,170 --> 01:48:12,130
I am very excited to be able to do something like this.

2144
01:48:12,190 --> 01:48:21,510
I hope to be able to do something more like this in the future, but also like, maybe not be fully in charge of this in the future and maybe get management to help me out.

2145
01:48:21,790 --> 01:48:24,550
Because my management team was like, are you fucking stupid?

2146
01:48:25,070 --> 01:48:26,490
And I was like, yes, um...

2147
01:48:29,070 --> 01:48:32,410
My management team was like, yeah, maybe don't.

2148
01:48:32,550 --> 01:48:36,230
Like, cause I was like, you know, screaming into the void, as in the void was tempo.

2149
01:48:36,510 --> 01:48:45,930
And then I started screaming at management being like, why do I have to find a team within 24 hours?!

2150
01:48:48,930 --> 01:48:51,450
And I'm like, oh my god!

2151
01:48:56,140 --> 01:48:59,440
And I was like, I have to find another person?!

2152
01:49:02,040 --> 01:49:09,660
And then, my management was like, if you do something like that again, um...

2153
01:49:10,680 --> 01:49:15,360
Maybe like, you should let us handle this, we should let us...

2154
01:49:16,780 --> 01:49:17,380
Hahahaha...

2155
01:49:18,600 --> 01:49:38,120
Anyway, also I wanna say, um, we do, I'll show you one of our emergency backup subs, because um, she can, she can speak both Japanese and So if something happens, we have someone that covers both languages that we need the most right now.

2156
01:49:38,220 --> 01:49:41,360
So, we have Eileen.

2157
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:45,640
For those who don't know her, she is a very talented VTuber.

2158
01:49:45,880 --> 01:49:47,280
She speaks a lot of languages.

2159
01:49:47,280 --> 01:49:50,920
And her name is Eileen Noir.

2160
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:58,540
And she is our emergency backup that can speak English and Japanese.

2161
01:49:59,160 --> 01:50:04,900
So, if anything happens in any team, we have Eileen here.

2162
01:50:05,040 --> 01:50:06,630
This is one of our emergency subs.

2163
01:50:06,630 --> 01:50:20,790
She's gonna be an emergency sub for a team that was gonna be an emergency sub for a different team, but then we got a person.

2164
01:50:21,110 --> 01:50:25,790
So then I was like, if anything happens, are you free on the 30th to be there?

2165
01:50:25,830 --> 01:50:26,750
And she said, yeah.

2166
01:50:27,170 --> 01:50:32,990
So, she's one of our three emergency backup subs in case something happens.

2167
01:50:32,990 --> 01:50:36,470
Now I have backups because I don't know what's gonna happen anymore.

2168
01:50:39,330 --> 01:50:41,730
I don't know what's gonna happen.

2169
01:50:41,950 --> 01:50:43,590
I can't take chances anymore.

2170
01:50:43,810 --> 01:50:49,990
The thing is, I never had an issue where I had to find so many backups.

2171
01:50:50,450 --> 01:50:54,190
But I don't trust myself anymore.

2172
01:50:58,010 --> 01:51:00,930
I don't trust myself anymore.

2173
01:51:01,290 --> 01:51:08,830
So, I'm so thankful for Eileen for being there to help us.

2174
01:51:11,930 --> 01:51:17,390
Yeah, I figured out that backups is a really good idea because we still have the 30th.

2175
01:51:17,470 --> 01:51:18,910
We have 60 players.

2176
01:51:19,690 --> 01:51:20,910
Something might happen.

2177
01:51:24,290 --> 01:51:25,570
60 players!

2178
01:51:26,110 --> 01:51:28,370
Probability-wise, I don't know.

2179
01:51:28,550 --> 01:51:30,690
Doesn't seem quite well for me.

2180
01:51:34,410 --> 01:51:42,230
So, what I learned so far is that it's very stressful.

2181
01:51:42,530 --> 01:51:45,370
Like I said, I've never organized something as stressful as this before.

2182
01:51:45,370 --> 01:51:49,790
So, I'm hoping that this goes well.

2183
01:51:50,090 --> 01:51:54,010
We'll see you guys next week to see if it does go well.

2184
01:51:54,270 --> 01:51:55,470
Anyway, guys!

2185
01:51:55,890 --> 01:51:57,210
That's the custom!

2186
01:51:57,790 --> 01:52:02,950
The Doki Bird X Oversight Custom 2024!

2187
01:52:03,910 --> 01:52:11,170
We hope you enjoy this announcement and I'll see you next week for the actual event.

2188
01:52:11,170 --> 01:52:16,110
Like I said, you're wondering why isn't this person, why isn't that person.

2189
01:52:16,730 --> 01:52:19,310
Usually, like I said, it's a balance.

2190
01:52:19,770 --> 01:52:32,570
It was basically, there's people that I personally invited, people that applied on the forum, people that messaged me to get invited.

2191
01:52:34,030 --> 01:52:36,070
And that's basically it.

2192
01:52:36,150 --> 01:52:39,290
So, it was a balance of all three of these.

2193
01:52:39,290 --> 01:52:43,310
And I wanted to have a lot of different skill levels participating.

2194
01:52:45,490 --> 01:52:51,110
And like I said, usually when I look for personal invites, these are the things I look at.

2195
01:52:51,530 --> 01:52:54,550
I look at, have they played Apex before on stream?

2196
01:52:55,190 --> 01:52:56,610
Do they follow me?

2197
01:52:56,870 --> 01:52:58,250
So I can message them.

2198
01:52:59,070 --> 01:53:00,830
Very important, by the way!

2199
01:53:01,450 --> 01:53:08,050
Annie was one of those I messaged because she follows me and she used to play Apex.

2200
01:53:08,190 --> 01:53:11,550
So I was like, do you want to be a, we need somebody right now.

2201
01:53:12,010 --> 01:53:13,470
And she was like, yeah!

2202
01:53:13,890 --> 01:53:15,870
So it was very easy!

2203
01:53:16,710 --> 01:53:23,390
Because mostly for me, it was like, am I able to message them if I want to invite somebody?

2204
01:53:26,290 --> 01:53:32,390
Because usually for DMs, a lot of YouTubers close their DMs.

2205
01:53:33,750 --> 01:53:40,230
And like the only, including me, but like, well, I do have like, there's one way to contact me.

2206
01:53:40,310 --> 01:53:41,430
You just have to have Twitter blue.

2207
01:53:42,230 --> 01:53:48,990
But like, even then I don't see those DMs unless like I follow you or like unless like, yeah, unless I follow you, then it shows up there.

2208
01:53:49,050 --> 01:53:52,590
But if you have Twitter blue and you try to DM me, because I get a lot of DMs.

2209
01:53:52,590 --> 01:53:53,770
I had to turn on Twitter blue.

2210
01:53:54,790 --> 01:54:08,510
It's more so of like, it goes to the thing where like, I don't know, the other category where, where it's like, you don't know who's actually DMing you, but you can check it type deal.

2211
01:54:08,850 --> 01:54:10,170
So there's that.

2212
01:54:10,610 --> 01:54:18,030
So the easiest way is that and sometimes, you know, you have to, they have the option where they follow this person so you can DM them.

2213
01:54:18,030 --> 01:54:20,710
Basically, yeah, the pending requests, that type of shit.

2214
01:54:21,250 --> 01:54:23,470
But yeah, that's basically it.

2215
01:54:23,530 --> 01:54:27,150
Those are basically what I looked at for like personal invites.

2216
01:54:27,290 --> 01:54:28,310
Do they follow me?

2217
01:54:28,490 --> 01:54:34,550
So I can send them a DM and ask them if they want to join or and like, have they played Apex before?

2218
01:54:36,030 --> 01:54:39,170
And that's really it for like personal invites.

2219
01:54:39,270 --> 01:54:46,430
Then I had people that asked me to be or do I have them on Discord or is there a way to contact them on Discord?

2220
01:54:46,430 --> 01:54:55,130
Also that too, the Discord option, which sometimes they, you know, if I already have them on Discord on server, like if I share server with them, fucking easy.

2221
01:54:55,650 --> 01:55:05,490
And then I had lots of people that asked me to be invited to be part of the custom, like Gerard asked if he could be part of the custom and I was like, sure, fucking let's go!

2222
01:55:05,770 --> 01:55:08,670
Like RPR asked if he could be in the custom, fucking come in!

2223
01:55:09,030 --> 01:55:09,790
Stuff like that.

2224
01:55:10,110 --> 01:55:12,570
So we had people asking and then I looked at the forums.

2225
01:55:12,570 --> 01:55:19,050
We had around, I believe, like Neoport actually applied via the forums.

2226
01:55:19,290 --> 01:55:23,810
I was very surprised to see a member from Neoport wanting to join in.

2227
01:55:23,910 --> 01:55:26,290
And I saw Neoport in there and I was like, yeah, of course!

2228
01:55:28,270 --> 01:55:34,410
Yeah, it would be a great honor to have JP.org to be part of it.

2229
01:55:34,410 --> 01:55:37,790
So Neoport applied via the forum and I was like, join in!

2230
01:55:38,110 --> 01:55:41,050
Project Kawaii applied via the forum, fucking let's go!

2231
01:55:41,270 --> 01:55:44,230
Akka Virtual applied via the forum, come right in!

2232
01:55:44,850 --> 01:55:50,330
Majority of people from companies that applied via the forum, I let them in.

2233
01:55:50,790 --> 01:55:51,510
It's that easy.

2234
01:55:53,690 --> 01:55:55,050
That's really it.

2235
01:55:56,170 --> 01:55:58,630
Anyway guys, that's it.

2236
01:55:58,810 --> 01:55:59,650
That's all to say.

2237
01:56:00,090 --> 01:56:04,750
Hope you enjoy this announcement for this custom.

2238
01:56:05,530 --> 01:56:06,670
Hope it goes okay.

2239
01:56:07,030 --> 01:56:08,490
We'll see next week.

2240
01:56:09,530 --> 01:56:10,550
We'll see!

2241
01:56:10,750 --> 01:56:12,510
I don't know, anything can happen.

2242
01:56:13,190 --> 01:56:17,690
From this custom, organizing it alone, yeah, anything can fucking happen.

2243
01:56:19,210 --> 01:56:22,210
Anyway, here's our hashtag for the event.

2244
01:56:22,550 --> 01:56:23,450
We'll see what happens.

2245
01:56:23,850 --> 01:56:26,730
Main broadcast, casting-wise, will be on Wig's channel.

2246
01:56:26,930 --> 01:56:30,010
On my channel, we'll have the interviews still on my channel.

2247
01:56:30,130 --> 01:56:34,730
I mean, Wig's gonna be streaming it as well, so you'll be able to hear that too.

2248
01:56:34,810 --> 01:56:42,670
But if you wanna watch it on YouTube, I'll have the interviews, I'll talk about the rules, we'll talk about the winners per game, we'll talk about the rules and everything.

2249
01:56:43,310 --> 01:56:47,770
So, like, explanations of everything will be on my channel, where we explain everything.

2250
01:56:48,230 --> 01:56:54,190
I will be starting earlier than the custom, so I can talk to Wig in Greek before the custom starts.

2251
01:56:55,990 --> 01:56:56,790
That's it.

2252
01:56:57,230 --> 01:56:59,410
Anyway guys, thank you all for coming.

2253
01:56:59,690 --> 01:57:03,270
Thank you to every- oh shit, forgot to say, credits-wise.

2254
01:57:04,130 --> 01:57:04,630
Credits!

2255
01:57:04,670 --> 01:57:07,350
I'm sorry, I didn't have time to finish the credits scene.

2256
01:57:07,350 --> 01:57:11,470
But we have me!

2257
01:57:12,270 --> 01:57:13,550
Hello, it's me.

2258
01:57:13,790 --> 01:57:22,370
I'll post the actual finished credits on Twitter, because I didn't finish the graphics for it.

2259
01:57:22,570 --> 01:57:26,410
No, it's stupid, because the graphics designer was like, are you sure you can do all of this?

2260
01:57:26,530 --> 01:57:31,790
You can give me the information, and then I'll just put everything in.

2261
01:57:31,850 --> 01:57:33,370
And I was like, don't worry, I got this.

2262
01:57:33,410 --> 01:57:35,670
But obviously, I don't have my shit together right now.

2263
01:57:41,400 --> 01:57:43,440
So, that's one of the things I forgot to do.

2264
01:57:43,580 --> 01:57:46,720
I'm so- I'm so sorry, that's one of the things I forgot.

2265
01:57:47,040 --> 01:57:47,940
I'm really sorry.

2266
01:57:48,260 --> 01:57:52,360
Anyway, I'm sorry, there's like empty space, because I forgot to put the graphics in there.

2267
01:57:52,540 --> 01:57:55,620
But I want you to know who fucking made the graphics.

2268
01:57:59,580 --> 01:58:02,840
So, Sugartype made the graphics.

2269
01:58:03,720 --> 01:58:06,900
Gamersubs will be handling the medals and the memorabilia.

2270
01:58:07,520 --> 01:58:10,660
Oversight is our partnership who helped us with the pros.

2271
01:58:10,660 --> 01:58:11,940
Um, Caster!

2272
01:58:12,300 --> 01:58:13,320
Nice wig and greek!

2273
01:58:13,460 --> 01:58:14,740
I could do it live!

2274
01:58:15,420 --> 01:58:19,860
If you really- Guys, don't make me do it live, because I will.

2275
01:58:20,260 --> 01:58:25,700
I- Nice wig, greek.

2276
01:58:28,080 --> 01:58:29,200
There we go.

2277
01:58:29,560 --> 01:58:32,800
Anyway, casters, we have nice wig and greek.

2278
01:58:32,800 --> 01:58:39,560
And then for our live translator, we have Dash.

2279
01:58:40,760 --> 01:58:41,600
There we go.

2280
01:58:42,260 --> 01:58:44,060
We'll just be like, here.

2281
01:58:44,700 --> 01:58:46,020
Dash, okay.

2282
01:58:46,720 --> 01:58:48,580
Um, he has no face.

2283
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:51,420
That's just him.

2284
01:58:52,060 --> 01:58:53,540
Dash, there we go.

2285
01:58:56,400 --> 01:58:58,160
Um, that's basically it.

2286
01:58:58,300 --> 01:59:04,520
This was basically a team of me, Dash, and Tempo, slash Oversight.

2287
01:59:04,640 --> 01:59:05,760
Tempo works on Oversight.

2288
01:59:06,160 --> 01:59:08,500
And Sugartype for the logo and the graphics.

2289
01:59:08,660 --> 01:59:11,260
Huge shoutout to Sugartype for creating all the graphics for us.

2290
01:59:11,260 --> 01:59:15,760
Um, but yes, me, Dash, and Tempo.

2291
01:59:15,860 --> 01:59:18,720
We managed to fucking put all of this together.

2292
01:59:18,900 --> 01:59:19,380
Us three.

2293
01:59:19,760 --> 01:59:20,500
Nobody else.

2294
01:59:20,680 --> 01:59:27,480
Just literally us just fucking hammer and nail and some superglue and hope everything will work out.

2295
01:59:32,220 --> 01:59:34,260
So, yes, huge shoutout.

2296
01:59:34,560 --> 01:59:37,000
And potential sponsor negotiation.

2297
01:59:37,420 --> 01:59:39,120
We're negotiating potential sponsor.

2298
01:59:39,660 --> 01:59:43,200
We'll announce it later this week when it happens.

2299
01:59:43,620 --> 01:59:44,760
But yes, thank you everybody.

2300
01:59:45,240 --> 01:59:46,400
Anyway, we're gonna call it here.

2301
01:59:46,700 --> 01:59:48,580
Thank you everybody for coming to the announcement.

2302
01:59:48,580 --> 01:59:53,520
Um, we'll see you, uh, we'll see you next week.

2303
01:59:53,820 --> 01:59:56,400
Um, this is a pilot, guys.

2304
01:59:56,800 --> 01:59:57,840
It feels like a pilot.

2305
01:59:58,620 --> 02:00:03,060
It really does feel like a pilot episode.

2306
02:00:03,240 --> 02:00:04,600
Nothing is ironed out yet.

2307
02:00:07,620 --> 02:00:10,580
And yes, as always everybody, stay hydrated.

2308
02:00:10,840 --> 02:00:11,400
Posture check.

2309
02:00:11,800 --> 02:00:13,920
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

2310
02:00:14,380 --> 02:00:17,940
And if you stayed up for me, head to bed cause you deserve it.

2311
02:00:18,020 --> 02:00:19,380
I'll see you guys next time everybody.

2312
02:00:19,800 --> 02:00:20,660
Bye guys.

2313
02:00:20,940 --> 02:00:21,420
Bye!
