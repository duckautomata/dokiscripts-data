That was awkward.

44
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:45,150

quiet.

45
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:46,290
Okay, I'll push it up.

46
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:50,210
Oh, it's because like, oh, it's because it reset itself.

47
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:53,610
It's because it reset itself when my OBS crashed.

48
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:54,830
All right, we're back.

49
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:10,750

52
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:21,630

All right, here you go.

59
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:17,430
I'm gonna be a mighty king So enemies beware Oh, that's mean
I'm gonna be the main event Like no king was before up on

Yeah, I'm the king.

64
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:59,210
I think it's time that you and I arrange the heart to heart.

65
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:04,250
Kings don't need advice from little hornbills for a start.

66
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:08,650
If this is where the monarchy is headed, call me out.

67
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:10,950
Out of service, out of the hour.

68
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:11,750
It's monarchy.

69
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:13,410
I wouldn't hide about.

70
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:17,170
This child is getting widely all the way.

71
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:17,970
That's me.

72
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:23,590
Oh, I just can't wait to be king.

73
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:25,630
Ba da, ba, ba, ba, ba.

74
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:27,050
Bam.

75
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:34,090
Hum.

76
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:37,270
Everybody look left.

77
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:39,910
Everybody look right.

78
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:42,210
Everybody look right.

79
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:44,690
Saturn's spotlight!

80
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:45,670
Not yet!

81
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:50,730
Yeah!

82
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:51,510
Let's hear it

83
00:10:56,050 --> 00:11:12,010
again You'd see the finest king Oh, I just can't wait to be
king Oh, I just can't wait to be king Oh, I just can't wait

84
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:16,730
To be king

85
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:26,570
That's me

86
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:33,250
That's me That's me I'm the king

87
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:50,070
I went with the The safest choice For the first song Because
I know that This was a song I sang a lot as a little as a

88
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:59,130
little bird so like that is why I decided to go with like
the safest choice that's the first song because I know that

89
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:06,510
like um I say I know the song like really really really
really well because I've listened to the song on repeat ever

90
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:12,010
since I was little so I was like all right this is this is
gonna be the first song I'll sing then because I and I know

91
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:20,310
this it's a good it's a it's a good warm-up song because
it's like oh man every song i know this one is the one that

92
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:31,390
like i have like the most confident so yeah the very first
song um but yes if you guys i don't know never heard of

93
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:42,230
disney before the very first song i sang was i just can't
wait to be king from lion king where's my little there it is

94
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:53,390
this is my set list the very first song i sang i just can't
wait to be king yes there is gonna be a lot i'm gonna warn

95
00:12:53,390 --> 00:13:02,890
you guys right now there's gonna be a lot of disney songs
because like uh disney songs is like the songs i'm most

96
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:13,870
confident in when it comes to singing uh so that's why i
decided it's majority disney uh majority of the stuff in

97
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:23,230
here is is disney so just just a little warning um give me a
sec i'm trying to grab my set list right now i think i'd

98
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:31,670
realize what's causing the the crashing a little bit and
it's because of uh i use uh i use caravan for like my

99
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:40,050
karaoke stuff and it's so fucking i guess it overloads
overloads my discord for some fucking reason which doesn't

100
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:44,250
make much sense because I'm like why does care fun overload
my discord?

101
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:48,990
So I'm just gonna grab my set list off of because I wrote my
set list off of discord.

102
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:53,990
So I'm gonna grab my set list and put it somewhere else so I
know where it is.

103
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,950
So I know which to go next.

104
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:00,370
Okay.

105
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:08,570
Let me let me make sure I can let me post this somewhere so
I can look at my set list whenever because like it's awkward

106
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:17,150
because like I was like forgot what to say next I'm so
nervous I'm so nervous right now and I'm forgetting things

107
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:27,250
at the moment oh okay I remember now guys this one this one
is also a classic that I like to uh let me all right you

108
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:37,490
guys might know what it is judging from what I'm wearing
soon very soon uh okay now you know what it is okay if you

109
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:44,870
guys can if you guys can recognize you know the first two
notes of that song, you might know what it is.

110
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:52,470
This is also a classic that...

111
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:57,150
I don't sing this as often, but I do like it very, very
much.

112
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:03,310
Okay.

113
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,380
Can I be?

114
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,840
I'm just doing what comes naturally.

115
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,280
How bad can I be?

116
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,560
I'm just following my destiny.

117
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,220
can I be?

118
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:21,640
I'm just doing what comes naturally.

119
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,020
How bad can I be?

120
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,320
How bad can I possibly be?

121
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,260
Something of principle in nature.

122
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,460
That almost every creature knows.

123
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,400
Call survival the fittest.

124
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:36,240
And chickens is how it goes.

125
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:41,160
The animal that wins is going to scratch and fight and claw
and fight and punch.

126
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:45,340
And the animal that does it, well the animal that does it,
well without someone

127
00:15:50,060 --> 00:16:01,260
I'm just saying how bad can I be I'm just doing what comes
naturally how bad can I be I'm just following my destiny how

128
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:12,340
bad can I be I'm just doing what comes naturally how bad can
I be how bad can I possibly be as a principal in business

129
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:17,400
that everybody knows the sound Instead of people with the
money.

130
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,200
Make this everworld go around.

131
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:25,060
So I'm figuring my companies, I'm figuring my factory, I'm
figuring my corporate sign.

132
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,560
Everybody out there, you take care of yours and me.

133
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:32,600
I'll take care of mine, mine, mine, mine, mine.

134
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,700
Let me hear you say smogulent smoke.

135
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,040
Slippily stop.

136
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:41,400
Complain all you at once.

137
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,680
It's never, ever, ever gonna stop.

138
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,320
Come on!

139
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,560
How bad can I possibly be?

140
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:52,320
I'm just building economy.

141
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,660
How bad, I, I, I, can I be?

142
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:57,160
Just look at me paying this puppy.

143
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,740
How bad, I, I, I, I can't be?

144
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:02,060
Come on.

145
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,500
How bad, I, I, I, I, can't I be?

146
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,680
How bad can I possibly be?

147
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,060
Let's see.

148
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:11,760
All the customers are buying.

149
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:35,460
multiplying and a PR people are lying and the lawyers are
denying who cares if a few trees are dying this is all so

150
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:41,280
gratifying how bad that can this possibly

151
00:17:46,660 --> 00:18:00,380
I'm a good person I don't know I think I'm a pretty good
person guys

152
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:20,760
anyway that was how bad can I be from Mr. Ed Helms himself
it's one of the one of the og tumblr boys out there what

153
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:31,840
capitalism does to a tomato um shout out to shout out to the
onesler the the og tumblr boy

154
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:47,380
let me take these off uh but it's how bad can i possibly be
of these songs I chose are like super in my vocal range

155
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:59,980
because or like I forced it to be in my vocal range because

244
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:26,510
one i've always i've been wanting to sing for a very very
very very very very long time um i never ever had a chance

245
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:35,430
to sing this song because it's sort of it's not really
obscure it's more like internet stuff it's like um um it's

246
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:42,050
sort of like if you were on the internet when this come came
out like it was everywhere and like it was it's based off of

247
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:49,370
a it's like a a mini project starring a lot of like really
big celebrities back then but it was like a fucking passion

248
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:58,790
project and but like um it was like you know it didn't
really have like actual music rights or anything so i never

249
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:04,750
had a chance to really sing this song and this is like a
song i really really really wanted to sing for for a while

250
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:17,930
now anyway so i think um the best way to do this is if i is
if i got the spotlight on put this on and you'll realize why

251
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:28,230
you'll realize why i put the spotlight on for this song all

342
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:38,160
the original singer Okay, I like the original singer But
like I don't like, I prefer this version more so than the

343
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:46,500
original singer's version so you might know because i've
sang this before but i still love it because i feel like the

344
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:54,360
message is like really powerful you

345
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:08,210
can never know what it's like your blood like winter freeze
is just like ice and there's a cold lonely night that shines

346
00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:17,230
from you you'll whine unlike the wreck you hide behind that
mask you use And did you think that girl couldn't ever win?

347
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:19,910
Well, look at me, I'm coming back again.

348
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:22,590
I got a taste of love in a simple way.

349
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:24,810
And you need to know I'm still standing.

350
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:27,030
You just fade away.

351
00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:32,430
Well, don't you know I'm still standing better than I ever
did?

352
00:39:33,410 --> 00:39:37,910
Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid.

353
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:43,610
And I'm still standing after all this time.

354
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:49,490
Faking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind.

355
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:54,170
I'm still standing, yeah, yeah, yeah.

356
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:58,730
I'm still standing, yeah, yeah.

357
00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:06,490
Once I never could hope to win, you staring down the roads
leaving me again.

358
00:40:06,770 --> 00:40:09,210
The threats you made were meant to cut me down.

359
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:13,570
If our love was just a circus, you'd be a clown by now.

360
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:26,050
Don't you know I'm still standing better than I ever did
Looking like a true survivor Feeling like a little kid And

361

I'm still standing after all this time Taking out the pieces
of my life without you on my mind I'm still standing, yeah,

362
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:45,530
yeah Yeah, yeah, yeah.

363
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:50,010
Pio, pio, pio, pio, pio.

00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:56,150
Pio, pio, pio, pio, pio, pio.

366
00:40:58,210 --> 00:41:00,090
It's an electric piano.

367

Don't you know, I'm still standing better than I ever did?

368
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:08,490
Looking like a true survivor.

369
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:11,130
Feeling like a little kid.

370

was, uh, I'm still standing.

373
00:41:51,530 --> 00:41:52,010
I don't know.

374
00:41:52,290 --> 00:41:59,690
For those who still don't know what that is, who would have
known, that was, I'm still standing by Elton John, but also,

375
00:41:59,810 --> 00:42:07,270
but I didn't sing Elton John's version because I like the
sing, the movie, movie sing version from Terran Eagerton,

376
00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:11,630
um, who also played Elton John on his like biopic movie.

377
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:20,970
I honestly prefer his version so much more especially in the
sing one when he's a gorilla and it's been one of my

378
00:42:20,970 --> 00:42:30,810
favorite songs like for a very long time so I am very happy

Prider sells on service.

419
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:00,940
You're the boss, the king, the shah.

420
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:03,720
Say what you wish, it's yours trudish.

421

Can your friends do that?

430
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:31,840
Do your friends pull this?

431
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:34,300
On their little hat.

432
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:36,560
Can your friends go poop?

433

Never had a friend.

448
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:22,660
You ain't never had a friend like me.

449
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:24,440
Ha ha ha.

450
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:31,020
You ain't never had a friend like me.

451
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:37,980
Yes.

452
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:44,100
That was also by...

453
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:56,580
shad huge shout out to shad for this amazing video edit um i
gave him some of the ideas to do you know i used to do this

454
00:47:56,580 --> 00:48:02,800
all by myself manually but then i was like why am i doing
this all by myself manually when i can like actually have

455
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:08,620
like you know when it can just play automatically for me
instead of me pressing on these buttons

456
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:15,540
But yes, huge shout out.

457
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:23,320
For those who don't know, it's never, sorry, never a friend
like me from Aladdin, the 1992 version with Robin Williams.

458
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:35,560
Because I'm sorry, Will Smith, but you can never live up to
Robin Williams version, the original genie.

459
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:41,840
So this was the original Robin Williams version of Friend
Like Me.

460
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:43,720
It's also one of my favorite songs as well.

461

479
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:47,780
the seed weed is always green now and somebody else is like
you dream about going there but that is a big mistake just

480
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:56,160
look at the world around you right here on the ocean floor
such wonderful things surround you what more is you looking

481
00:51:56,160 --> 00:52:08,460
for under the sea under the sea darling it's better
downwards wet to take it from me up on the shore they work

482
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:15,320
all day out in the sun to slave away while we devoting full
time to floating under the sea.

483
00:52:19,580 --> 00:52:24,380
Down here all the fish is happy as all through the waves
they roll.

484
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:26,840
The fish on the land ain't happy.

485
00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:29,080
They sad cause they're in their bowl.

486
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:31,600
But fish in the bowl is lucky.

487
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:33,780
They in for a worse fate.

488
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:38,520
One day when the boss gets hungry, guess who's coming on
that play?

489
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:40,520
Uh-oh, under the sea.

490
00:52:42,060 --> 00:52:47,880
Under the sea, nobody beat us, fry us and eat us in
fricassee.

491
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:53,420
We what the land folks loves to cook, under the sea we off
the hook.

492
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:56,220
We got no troubles, life is the bubbles.

493
00:52:56,680 --> 00:53:04,360
Under the sea, under the sea, since life is sweet here, we
got the beat here, naturally.

494
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:10,360
Even the surgeon and the rave, they get the urge to start to
play.

495
00:53:12,060 --> 00:53:14,240
You've got to hear it under the sea.

496
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:20,540
The newt play the flute, the carp play the harp, the place
play the bass and they sounding sharp.

497
00:53:20,860 --> 00:53:22,940
The bass play the brass and the chub play the tub.

498
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:24,820
The fluke is the duke of soul.

499
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:27,780
The right he can play, the lings on the string.

500
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:30,140
The trout rocking out, the blackfish he sings.

501
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:32,500
The smell and the sprite, they know where it's at.

502
00:53:32,860 --> 00:53:34,760
And oh, that blowfish blow!

503
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:50,180
I hope you're not drowning in water now, dragons, Water!

504
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:53,000
Yeah!

505
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:02,300
Under the sea!

506
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:04,760
Under the sea!

507
00:54:06,140 --> 00:54:09,560
When the sardine begin to begin, this music to me!

508
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:11,600
What do they say?

509
00:54:11,860 --> 00:54:12,800
A lot of sand!

510
00:54:13,220 --> 00:54:15,380
We got a hot crustacean fan!

511
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:18,980
Each little clam here know how to jam here under the sea!

512
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:23,860
Each little slug here, caught in a rug here, under the sea.

513
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:27,460
Each little snail here, do you know how to wail here?

514
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:29,840
That's why it's hot here, under the water.

515
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:33,740
Yeah, we're lucky, down in the muck here, under the sea.

516
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:37,860
Woo!

517
00:54:39,260 --> 00:54:45,640

science We do what we must because we can For the good of

529
00:56:58,230 --> 00:57:08,230
all of us Except the ones who are dead But there's no sense
crying over every mistake You just keep on trying till you

530
00:57:08,230 --> 00:57:16,790
run out of cake And the science gets done And you make a
neat gun For the people who are still alive

531
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:31,660
I swear I'm being so sincere right now.

532
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:37,060
Even though you broke my heart and killed me.

533
00:57:37,660 --> 00:57:38,340
I swear I'm not angry.

534
00:57:39,220 --> 00:57:40,800
And tore me to pieces.

535
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:46,600
And threw every piece into a fire.

536
00:57:48,220 --> 00:57:53,480
As they burned it hurt because I was so happy for you.

537
00:57:54,520 --> 00:58:04,680
of data make a beautiful line and we're out of beta we're
releasing on time so I'm glad I got burned think of all the

538
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:16,320
things we've learned we're the people who are still alive
and there's people still alive guys don't worry go ahead and

539
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:28,920
leave me I think I prefer to stay inside Maybe you'll find
someone else to help you.

540
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:32,760
Maybe Black Mesa.

541
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:36,600
That was a joke.

542
00:58:36,820 --> 00:58:38,620
Ha ha, fat chance.

543
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:43,540
Anyway, this cake is great.

544
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:45,480
It's so delicious and moist.

545
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:49,480
Look at me still talking when there's science to do.

546
00:58:49,820 --> 00:58:53,500
When I look out there, it makes me glad I'm not here.

547
00:58:54,600 --> 00:59:00,740
There is research to be done on the people who are still
alive.

548
00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:04,660
And believe me, I am still alive.

549
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:08,780
I'm doing science and I'm still alive.

550
00:59:09,660 --> 00:59:10,680
I feel fantastic.

551
00:59:11,020 --> 00:59:12,800
And I'm still alive.

552
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:16,600
While you're dying, I'll be still alive.

553
00:59:17,580 --> 00:59:20,880
And when you're dead, I'll be still alive.

554
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:22,760
Still alive.

555
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:26,340
Because I'm virtual.

556
00:59:26,940 --> 00:59:27,880
I don't know if you know that.

557
00:59:34,620 --> 00:59:36,180
Just so you guys know.

558
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:37,360
I'm just, I'm virtual.

559
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:38,660
And that's why I'm still be alive.

560
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:42,000
Anyway, you don't get the cake.

561
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:46,940
No, my immersion!

562
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:48,560

563
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,500

564
00:59:55,860 --> 01:00:01,320
no kick for you guys sorry because i'm the one that's still
alive all right guys i'm gonna like undownload myself from

565
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:11,320
the tv now and for those who don't know that song was still
alive from portal um uh honestly uh i remember like

566
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:16,820
listening to that song on repeat when i was like a little
little dokey so i was like you know what let's do it also

567
01:00:16,820 --> 01:00:23,660
like i wanted to sing this for a while too but like
obviously like still alive has like a weird song like when

568
01:00:23,660 --> 01:00:26,720
it comes to When it comes to like berms and stuff.

569
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:32,000
Yes, I downloaded a cake into the TV.

570
01:00:32,220 --> 01:00:33,000
So it's now mine.

571
01:00:33,260 --> 01:00:35,360
So I'm glad I'm able to actually sing this song.

572
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:36,520
It was a little scuffed.

573
01:00:36,700 --> 01:00:39,260
I mean, to be fair, this entire karaoke was a little
scuffed.

574
01:00:39,540 --> 01:00:40,820
But it's not about how well I sing.

575
01:00:40,980 --> 01:00:42,360
It's about how good it looks.

576
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:45,560
It's all about the visuals.

577
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:52,400
It's all about the visuals.

578
01:00:52,820 --> 01:00:54,300
Not about how I sing.

579
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:56,740
Just look at how pretty everything looks.

580
01:00:56,880 --> 01:01:02,560
All right, time to go back to the venue, guys.

581
01:01:02,940 --> 01:01:03,500
Move along.

582
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:04,160
Move along.

583
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:05,460
Back to the concert hall.

584
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:07,640
Back to the concert hall, everybody.

585
01:01:08,860 --> 01:01:09,840
All right, we're back here.

586
01:01:10,260 --> 01:01:11,360
I don't think I'm going to update the list.

587
01:01:11,460 --> 01:01:12,800
I'm getting lazier, so we're going to...

588
01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:19,700
I'm getting a little lazier, so I'm just going to get rid of
the list right now.

589
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:23,040
Anyway, guys, anyway, this one is a classic, too.

590
01:01:25,300 --> 01:01:26,500
It's Christmas now.

591
01:01:28,140 --> 01:01:28,580
Oh my god.

592
01:01:28,660 --> 01:01:30,840
Do you know at this point with global warming, it might as
well be?

593
01:01:31,140 --> 01:01:35,380
You know, it might as well be like...

594
01:01:35,380 --> 01:01:36,240
It might as well...

595
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:38,920
It might as well still be snowing.

596
01:01:39,140 --> 01:01:41,520
It might as well...

597
01:01:43,580 --> 01:01:44,540
Okay, let me...

598
01:01:45,060 --> 01:01:46,060
Let me second pull this.

602
01:01:52,180 --> 01:01:52,960

Oh yeah, I...

627
01:03:54,380 --> 01:04:03,880
this song okay like i have like a favorite cover version of
this song and it's from like it's like a female version of

628
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:12,200
this and like she's so good like she sounds like spinel from
like that the the the that's even universe movie she sounds

629
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:19,340
just like her and like she did like a female version cover
of uh snow miser and that song's been stuck in my head ever

630
01:04:19,340 --> 01:04:26,780
since um huge shout out to her though because she is
actually so fucking talented and like she honestly like

631
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:36,560
inspired like not inspire me but like she actually like made
me uh made me like really like this song in general because

632
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:45,000
of the the english cover of i think if you look up female
cover uh snow mazer uh you might be able to find it like it

633
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:55,400
it's sort of it has like uh like i i'm basically sort of
emulating her voice when i sing this yeah like when you hear

634
01:04:55,400 --> 01:05:05,660
the cover you're like oh yeah she's definitely trying to
like emulate her voice yes this is uh this one was uh snow

635
01:05:05,660 --> 01:05:14,520
miser from something something the year of santa claus uh
the original version i don't like it as much to be fair uh i

636
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:16,320
don't really like Heat miser song.

637
01:05:16,860 --> 01:05:20,220
Heat miser is like way too fucking slow for me.

638
01:05:20,740 --> 01:05:27,580
Um so but like Snow miser is like I don't I don't know I I
never like thought much about the Snow miser song until like

639
01:05:27,580 --> 01:05:39,140
I heard the female cover of it and it was just so um um that
is like that's why like it's I like remember it so well um

640
01:05:39,140 --> 01:05:40,980
because like the female cover was just so good.

641
01:05:41,380 --> 01:05:52,300
Anyway it's snowy stopped everything no more snow

try my best disappear as a moral dilemma because at first it

649
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:14,300
was weird though i swore to eliminate the worst of the
plague that devour where humanity it's true i was vague on

I'm going to find the lyrics version so I know how to sing
it.

764
01:19:43,680 --> 01:19:45,600
Okay, here we go.

765
01:19:46,760 --> 01:19:52,920
All right, so the reason why is because I thought this song
really fits me really well.

766
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:07,360
To be fair, this is like the most skeptical wait this is
actually sort of like the rest after that i haven't no other

767
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:12,880
songs after this i'll just like are not like prepared
there's no like sets for anything for it but i just went

768
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:21,060
after this song actually no after the welcome to the
internet songs after that there's actual no no like sets or

769
01:20:21,060 --> 01:20:27,240
props for the songs after that but so like you could take
welcome to the internet as like the finale but we're still

770
01:20:27,240 --> 01:20:29,020
going on we're gonna still go on

771
01:20:35,780 --> 01:20:37,680

01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,060
There's no need to disguise.

780
01:21:49,300 --> 01:21:49,620
Really?

781
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,020
We're doing a sequel.

782
01:21:52,120 --> 01:21:54,000
The Dragoons once more.

783
01:21:54,220 --> 01:21:57,780
Now they wait for Tom Hanks to make Toy Story 4.

784
01:21:58,440 --> 01:22:02,960
It was the end, but no, my friends, this is when we do, do

01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:36,040

789
01:22:37,700 --> 01:22:42,060
My friends, this is it, we get to do it all again!

790
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:50,100
We got another goal to show that we can do it all again!

791
01:22:51,400 --> 01:22:53,440
The Tocky World Tour!

792
01:22:54,760 --> 01:22:55,600
But it's again!

793
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:57,700
It's a Tocky again!

794
01:22:58,940 --> 01:23:01,760
It's the Tocky!

795
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:03,880
Again!

796
01:23:04,260 --> 01:23:06,340
Okay, I just stopped there.

797
01:23:10,580 --> 01:23:13,300
This is like, I really wanted to sing this song.

798
01:23:13,420 --> 01:23:16,380
Even though I had no karaoke, I really wanted to sing.

799
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:17,460
It just ends like that.

800
01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:22,980
The abrupt cut.

801
01:23:23,380 --> 01:23:26,780
I really wanted to sing because I was like, this is so, this
feels so me.

802
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:29,980
The Doki World Tour.

803
01:23:33,080 --> 01:23:35,640
It just, it actually just stops there.

804
01:23:36,160 --> 01:23:37,300
I was like, wait, what?

805
01:23:39,200 --> 01:23:40,480
I was so surprised.

806
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:41,600
I thought there'd be more.

807
01:23:42,100 --> 01:23:43,840
But I guess this was the movie version.

808
01:23:44,020 --> 01:23:45,900
I got the movie version, by the way.

809
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:53,480
Um, I was like, all right, this must be the right video, I
think, because it's like, but there's actually a four minute

810
01:23:53,480 --> 01:23:56,260
video, but I was like, you know what, the short version is
good enough.

811
01:23:56,600 --> 01:23:58,860
The short version is, is good enough for us.

812
01:23:59,060 --> 01:24:04,520
Uh, but it's, we're doing a sequel God this relates to me.

813
01:24:05,400 --> 01:24:08,400
This relates to me so hard.

814
01:24:08,860 --> 01:24:14,020
So I was like we're gonna we're gonna do it all again guys

Nope.

827
01:25:11,220 --> 01:25:12,660
Good thing you guys didn't hear that.

Okay.

831
01:25:26,840 --> 01:25:27,140
Guys, ready?

832
01:25:28,820 --> 01:25:29,300
Alright.

833
01:25:30,340 --> 01:25:36,520
So, the only way to get what you want is to become a human
yourself.

834
01:25:39,080 --> 01:25:41,540
My dear, sweet child.

835
01:25:42,140 --> 01:25:43,200
That's what I do.

836
01:25:43,960 --> 01:25:45,680
It's what I live for.

837
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:49,680
To help unfortunate dragoons like yourself.

838
01:25:50,580 --> 01:25:53,920
Poor souls with no one else to turn.

839
01:25:53,940 --> 01:25:54,600
too.

840
01:25:57,060 --> 01:26:02,740
I admit that in the past I've been a nasty they weren't
kidding when they called me well a witch.

841
01:26:03,560 --> 01:26:06,840
But you'll find that nowadays I mended all my ways.

842
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:09,520
Repent to seem the light and made a switch.

843
01:26:10,280 --> 01:26:10,280
True?

844
01:26:10,700 --> 01:26:11,240
Yes.

845
01:26:12,180 --> 01:26:15,240
And I fortunately know a little magic.

846
01:26:15,980 --> 01:26:18,380
It's a talent that I've always had possessed.

847
01:26:19,260 --> 01:26:20,940
And dear lady please don't laugh.

848
01:26:21,220 --> 01:26:35,100
I use it on behalf of the miserable lonely and depressed
pathetic poor unfortunate souls in pain and nude this one's

849
01:26:35,100 --> 01:26:45,620
lying to be thinner that one wants to get the girl and do I
help them yes indeed those poor unfortunate souls so sad so

850
01:26:45,620 --> 01:26:55,340
true they come flocking to my cauldron crying spells are so
pleased and I help them yes I do let's happen once or twice.

851
01:26:56,100 --> 01:26:57,560
Someone couldn't pay the price.

852
01:26:58,040 --> 01:27:01,400
And I'm afraid I had to rake and cross the coals.

853
01:27:02,320 --> 01:27:04,620
Yes, I've had beyond complaint.

854
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:12,520
But on the whole, I've been a saint to those poor
unfortunate souls.

855
01:27:15,880 --> 01:27:18,080
Have we got a deal, Dragons?

856
01:27:18,540 --> 01:27:21,800
If you become human, I'll never be with my father and
sisters again.

857
01:27:22,220 --> 01:27:23,920
But you'll have you.

858
01:27:23,940 --> 01:27:25,240
You're Doki!

859
01:27:27,380 --> 01:27:30,240
Life's full of tough choices, isn't it?

860
01:27:32,380 --> 01:27:33,060
Oh.

861
01:27:33,780 --> 01:27:35,360
And there is one more thing.

862
01:27:36,100 --> 01:27:36,320
Hmm.

863
01:27:36,940 --> 01:27:39,540
We haven't discussed the subject of payment.

864
01:27:40,760 --> 01:27:41,660
I'm not asking much.

865
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:43,020
Just a token, really?

866
01:27:43,680 --> 01:27:44,380
An Akasupa?

867
01:27:44,940 --> 01:27:48,380
What I want from you is your voice.

868
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:52,640
You'll have your looks?

869
01:27:54,260 --> 01:28:04,980
beak and don't underestimate the importance of body language
the men out there don't like a lot of blabber they think a

870
01:28:04,980 --> 01:28:11,900
girl who gossips as a boy yes I'm Lannis Pritch preferred
for ladies not to say a word and after all dear what is idle

871
01:28:11,900 --> 01:28:19,920
Pratt for come on they're not that impressed with
conversation true gentlemen avoid it when they can but they

872
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:24,780
don't ensue in fun on a lady who's withdrawn is she who
holds her tongue who gets a man.

873
01:28:25,180 --> 01:28:28,560
Come on, you poor and fortunate soul.

874
01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:30,020
Go ahead.

875
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:31,700
Make your choice.

876
01:28:32,100 --> 01:28:33,640
I'm a very busy woman.

877
01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:35,120
I haven't got all day.

878
01:28:35,240 --> 01:28:36,300
It won't cost much.

879
01:28:36,620 --> 01:28:37,660
Just your voice.

880
01:28:38,080 --> 01:28:40,420
You poor and fortunate soul.

881
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:41,840
It's sad.

882
01:28:42,200 --> 01:28:42,900
But true.

883
01:28:43,560 --> 01:28:46,200
If you want to cross the bridge, my sweet, you've got to pay
the toll.

884
01:28:46,420 --> 01:28:49,140
Take a gulp and take a breath and go ahead and sign the
scroll.

885
01:28:49,460 --> 01:28:50,200
Floss them, Jessam.

886
01:28:50,300 --> 01:28:51,500
Now I've got it, boys.

887
01:28:51,620 --> 01:28:53,440
The boss is on a roll.

888
01:28:54,720 --> 01:28:59,940
This poor, unfortunate soul!

889
01:29:06,660 --> 01:29:10,940
Beluga, Saruga, come winds of the Caspian Seas.

890
01:29:12,840 --> 01:29:17,860
Larissa glass, this is Latin, I cannot say la voce to me.

891
01:29:20,340 --> 01:29:21,760
Now super chat.

892
01:29:25,560 --> 01:29:28,360

Thank you.

895
01:30:10,290 --> 01:30:12,350
That is the longest fucking outro.

896
01:30:13,110 --> 01:30:13,970
I forgot.

897
01:30:17,550 --> 01:30:19,750
Thank you for all the super chats, everybody.

898
01:30:19,890 --> 01:30:21,430
Oh my god, did I got Jesus Christ?

899

Thank you, Jesus, for the super chat.

900

Thank you, thank you.

901
01:30:30,030 --> 01:30:30,850
That was funny.

902
01:30:31,030 --> 01:30:35,670
I forgot how long the outro was for this fucking song.

903
01:30:38,770 --> 01:30:46,790

Thank you, thank you.

908
01:31:10,790 --> 01:31:11,150
All right.

909
01:31:11,410 --> 01:31:13,270
You know, let me...

910
01:31:13,270 --> 01:31:14,390
All right, we'll do this one.

911
01:31:14,430 --> 01:31:15,770
I actually do have props for this.

912
01:31:16,050 --> 01:31:16,990
So, give me a sec.

913
01:31:17,250 --> 01:31:18,770
Let me...

914
01:31:20,430 --> 01:31:21,090
Actually, I don't.

915
01:31:21,110 --> 01:31:21,930
I don't know where it is.

916
01:31:22,030 --> 01:31:24,210
I didn't prepare this prop because this was a bonus song.

917
01:31:24,430 --> 01:31:25,690
But this is another Disney song.

918
01:31:26,070 --> 01:31:27,830
I'll sing another Disney song for all you guys.

919
01:31:29,650 --> 01:31:32,990
And it will end it with a encore of a song I did before.

920
01:31:35,630 --> 01:31:36,830
I forgot to hydrate.

921
01:31:41,490 --> 01:31:44,470
You might recognize this because it's on my channel.

922
01:31:46,570 --> 01:31:52,690
It's also one of the easiest Disney songs out there, so
there's no way I can fuck it up, right?

923
01:31:54,050 --> 01:31:54,650
Bam.

924
01:31:57,670 --> 01:31:58,270
Hello.

925
01:32:06,670 --> 01:32:11,270
Look for the bare necessities, the simple bare necessities.

926
01:32:11,290 --> 01:32:15,190
Forget about your worries and your strife.

927
01:32:15,770 --> 01:32:16,170
That's right.

928
01:32:16,510 --> 01:32:24,670
I mean the bare necessities, old mother nature's recipes
that bring the bare necessities of life.

929
01:32:26,210 --> 01:32:34,030
Wherever I wonder, wherever I roam, I couldn't be fonder of
my big home.

930
01:32:35,090 --> 01:32:39,770
The bees are buzzing in the trees and make some honey just
for me.

931
01:32:41,290 --> 01:32:47,530
under the rocks and plants and take a glance at the fancy
ants and maybe try a few.

932
01:32:55,620 --> 01:32:59,680
The bare necessities of life will come to you.

933
01:33:00,720 --> 01:33:02,480
They'll come to you.

934
01:33:03,220 --> 01:33:08,060
Look for the bare necessities, the simple bare necessities.

935
01:33:08,460 --> 01:33:11,140
Forget about your worries and your strife.

936
01:33:11,320 --> 01:33:11,920
That's right!

937
01:33:12,340 --> 01:33:15,040
I mean the bare necessities.

938
01:33:16,980 --> 01:33:20,600
at ease with just the bare necessities of life.

939
01:33:21,760 --> 01:33:31,760
Now, when you pick a paw paw, or a prickly pear, and you
prick a raw paw, well, next time, beware, don't pick that

940
01:33:31,760 --> 01:33:39,440
prickly pear by the paw, when you pick a pear, try to use
the claw, but you don't need to use the claw when you pick a

941
01:33:39,440 --> 01:33:42,680
pair of the big paw paw, have by giving you a clue.

942
01:33:45,200 --> 01:33:45,400
Hmm?

943
01:33:45,960 --> 01:33:46,520
You understand?

944
01:33:51,980 --> 01:33:55,740
The bare necessities of life will come to you.

945
01:33:56,720 --> 01:33:57,780
They'll come to you.

946
01:33:59,560 --> 01:33:59,740
Alright.

947
01:34:00,140 --> 01:34:01,700
Pretend I have a trumpet solo.

948
01:34:02,180 --> 01:34:05,380
I have a trumpet right now.

949
01:34:06,860 --> 01:34:07,580
Oh, wait.

950
01:34:07,700 --> 01:34:08,120
I know.

951
01:34:08,660 --> 01:34:09,620
My piano trumpet.

952
01:34:10,420 --> 01:34:12,180
Pretend my piano's playing the trumpet.

953
01:34:14,180 --> 01:34:16,020
It's like those electric pianos.

954
01:34:17,180 --> 01:34:20,120
Oh my god, now I'm doing margaritas on my electric piano.

955
01:34:20,120 --> 01:34:27,580
Oh my god.

956
01:34:27,680 --> 01:34:27,680
Oh,

957
01:34:35,540 --> 01:34:40,680
look at my fingers go on the piano.

958
01:34:41,620 --> 01:34:41,820
Oh.

959
01:34:46,080 --> 01:34:50,880
How does she do it on the electric piano?

960
01:34:52,860 --> 01:34:54,540
Chucked it off.

961
01:34:56,060 --> 01:34:58,300
Ah, man, that was really living.

962
01:35:00,220 --> 01:35:04,200
So just try and relax.

963
01:35:04,920 --> 01:35:06,980
Yeah, cool it.

964
01:35:07,340 --> 01:35:10,000
Fall apart in my backyard.

965
01:35:11,060 --> 01:35:13,860
Because let me tell you something, little britches.

966
01:35:13,880 --> 01:35:16,380
You act like that bees act.

967
01:35:16,700 --> 01:35:19,640
Uh, uh, uh, you're working too hard.

968
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:28,720
And don't spend your time looking around for something you
want that can't be found.

969
01:35:30,200 --> 01:35:33,280
When you find out you can live without it and go along.

970
01:35:33,580 --> 01:35:34,800
Not thinking about it.

971
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:36,600
I'll tell you something true.

972
01:35:37,720 --> 01:35:41,200
The bare necessities of life will come to you.

973
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:43,520
They'll come to you.

974
01:35:48,500 --> 01:35:54,380
Look for the fair necessities, the simple fair necessities.

975
01:35:54,780 --> 01:35:57,500
Forget about your worries and your strife.

976
01:35:57,740 --> 01:36:01,280
Damn right, I mean the fair necessities.

977
01:36:01,520 --> 01:36:06,900
That's why a bear can rest at ease with just the bare
necessities of life.

978
01:36:08,500 --> 01:36:11,580
With just the bare necessities of life.

979
01:36:11,900 --> 01:36:12,960
Yeah, man!

980
01:36:15,880 --> 01:36:21,500
Did you know this is the easiest Disney song out there in
the world?

981
01:36:24,220 --> 01:36:25,660
There's no way I could fuck it up.

982
01:36:25,800 --> 01:36:27,740
It's literally the one that easiest Disney songs out there.

983
01:36:28,340 --> 01:36:29,740
Praise for bare necessities.

984
01:36:34,260 --> 01:36:36,940
Yeah, it's literally the easiest one.

985
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:42,220
Out of all the Disney songs out there, if you look it up,
the bare necessities is the easiest because it has like a

986
01:36:42,220 --> 01:36:43,520
very small vocal range.

My son could've been a doctor or a lawyer rich and true.

1020
01:39:35,420 --> 01:39:38,260
Instead he burned up like a piggy on a barbecue.

1021
01:39:41,080 --> 01:39:42,880
This is Canada's fault.

1022

like honestly used the program care fun program instead of

1071
01:43:35,520 --> 01:43:42,340
like the um instead of like the web version and it was the
word version that was causing all my crashes and the moment

1072
01:43:42,340 --> 01:43:56,740
i swapped um the moment i i swapped to to to like the the
actual um the the program is stopped crashing and i'm like

1073
01:43:56,740 --> 01:44:04,140
no i wish i'd done that in the beginning and then we would
have been scutted we would have been crashing

this karaoke a lot more I feel like I definitely could have

1087
01:46:00,940 --> 01:46:05,920
worked on it a lot more um and gave myself more time but it
was definitely harder to balance everything that was going

1088

on and I definitely could have practiced the songs a lot
more um um um but next time i'll make sure it's even all
