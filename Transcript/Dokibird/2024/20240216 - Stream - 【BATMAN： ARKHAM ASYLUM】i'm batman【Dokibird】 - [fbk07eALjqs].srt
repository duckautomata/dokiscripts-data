1
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,660
Hello everybody!

2
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:51,580
Hello, we're gonna start off by, whoa, Batman.

3
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:58,020
Okay, this like pan up all the way.

4
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,920
Yeah, let's just end it off on his pecs, I guess.

5
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:05,300
Damn, no face.

6
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,280
We're not here to look at Batman's fucking face.

7
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:17,240
We know his real assets right there.

8
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:20,100
Wow, Batman!

9
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:21,700
Damn!

10
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,420
Oh my god.

11
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,720
Well, hello, everybody.

12
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:29,500
Yeah, surprise!

13
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,460
A Batman stream!

14
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,480
I just, you know, his eyes are...

15
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,960
Yeah, his eyes are up here.

16
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:37,500
Yes!

17
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:46,420
If the game knows where it's supposed to end, Then, all I'm
trying to do is, like, you know, I'm trying to, whoa, see,

18
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,160
look at that.

19
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,840
Why is it never showing me his face?

20
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:58,740
But, yeah, anyway, as I was saying, surprise stream, I
really wanted to play Batman.

21
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:04,740
Yeah, like, I just, I just really wanted to play Batman.

22
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:13,580
We weren't able to earlier, so I was like, ah, I don't want
to be like, you know, The only gaming streams we had was

23
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:15,060
literally Apex.

24
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:20,540
I was like, I don't really want to have, like, back-to-back
Apex.

25
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:25,200
So, um, surprise, double stream.

26
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,940
We're going to start off with Batman.

27
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,480
And then later on, transition over to Apex.

28
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:34,060
Because I just thought it was, I don't know.

29
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:38,680
I thought it was a little weird to have, like, back-to-back
Apex.

30
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:44,900
I know you're like, but Doki, it's all, you're all about
Apex.

31
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:50,480
Guys, it's not just, I'm more, I'm more than just Apex.

32
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:55,380
Oh my God, Sam, thank you for the 50 Gifted Chips.

33
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:56,640
Thank you, thank you.

34
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:02,360
Guys, just like Batman, I'm more than just the Pax.

35
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,500
Just like Batman, there's more to me.

36
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:19,340
than just pecs guys there's more than me than just apex
there's more and that is why we're playing batman i'm a

37
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:30,940
variety streamer exactly anyway i've never played um i've
never played batman before um i've never played that like

38
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:40,380
okay i'm okay i've never played this type of batman game
before I've actually, I remember the, I remember, uh, my dad

39
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:47,660
playing, um, the Batman Arkham Asylum, like the Batman
series from the Arkham Asylum series.

40
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,200
Um, a long time ago.

41
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,160
Did you guys know this game is 10 years old?

42
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:57,960
Yes, I, I know a lot of dragoons are going to be incredibly
old.

43
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:00,240
Feel very old right now.

44
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:04,600
But this game is like more than 14 years old now.

45
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:19,140
it is almost 14 years oh no it's not even almost it is 14
years old now and um but yes I remember 14 years ago I

46
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:28,880
watched my dad play this game um and I don't really remember
much I know it's like voiced by Mark Hamill and Kevin Conroy

47
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:38,920
um who are like sort of like the OG like voice actors and
like the voice actors for like Batman um so it's gonna be

48
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:45,920
very very exciting I've always loved DC comics and I always
loved DC characters I've always loved like why don't we like

49
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:57,300
Batman per se I like Joker as a character I think Batman I
was just not like like you know he's just Batman but

50
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:03,800
honestly I feel I would I liked Joker more than Batman
because I felt like Joker was much of an interesting

51
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:13,620
character than he is he's just you know he's like a
billionaire depressed man who just you know number one rule

52
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:21,720
we don't kill anybody but i'll beat you up so hard that
you're you you'll have to deal with like millions of dollars

53
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:31,060
of hospital bills and on at least at the okay not gonna lie
his one rule being like i can't kill anybody but like i feel

54
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:43,560
like it's much worse being like ridden with like hospital
debt medical debt versus like you know like honestly for him

55
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:51,760
he doesn't care he's a fucking billionaire he doesn't have
to live through medical debt but like medical bills but but

56
00:07:51,760 --> 00:08:01,820
an average criminal dealing with crippling medical debt is a
lot worse than just being dead and i feel like that you know

57
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:10,140
can be like wow batman that's so kind of you to not kill
them but i'm like at this point they might as well be dead

58
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:22,380
like he might as he owns the hot wait you're right that's so
fucked up batman if he owns the hospital that's pretty

59
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:34,180
fucked up oh my god this goes so deep anyway let's fucking
play Okay, I'll say, okay, what's the difficulty?

60
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,040
We'll do normal.

61
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:35,880
I'm going to do tough.

62
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,820
Oh, my God.

63
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:39,080
No, I don't want to deal with bullet sponges.

64
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,860
They should only be a type I hurt.

65
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,240
Expert, bro, okay.

66
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,200
This is not an FPS.

67
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,760
This is not an FPS.

68
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,300
I don't want to deal with bullet sponges right now.

69
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,600
This game isn't old.

70
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,940
The Xbox 360.

71
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,160
Oh, my God.

72
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,900
I can't believe you're trying to bring up the Xbox right
now.

73
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,920
Now to...

74
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,280
Batman.

75
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,720
Okay, I'm gonna say it.

76
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:14,400
A lot of like the DC heroes, character-wise, they're pretty
bland.

77
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:17,100
Like, not just, sorry, not just DC heroes.

78
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:23,480
Marvel and DC heroes, some of them are incredibly bland when
it comes to like personality.

79
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:26,900
I feel like the villains are much more interesting.

80
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,840
Is this a Batman that uses guns?

81
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,500
There's a lot of them.

82
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:36,120
There's a lot of them.

83
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:38,400
Whoa.

84
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,500
Oh, the volume's not too loud.

85
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:43,700
Sound check guy.

86
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:44,740
Help me.

87
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,080
Arkham.

88
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:55,730
There he is.

89
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:56,470
Oh.

90
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,920
Oh, joker.

91
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,920
Oh, a little quiet.

92
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,460
On the quiet side?

93
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:09,820
Oh, don't worry.

94
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:18,200
As long as the intro over oh my god you know the graphics
didn't age quite well for something that was 14 years ago i

95
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:26,600
think like okay hot take i think like a lot of the older
games look a lot better than the newer games because they

96
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:36,160
were not pressured to like make games a lot like they're not
pressured to make games in time for the holidays versus a

97
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,560
lot of the more recent games coming out

98
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,180
More camels!

99
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,680
That's warden shop to you.

100
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,280
Holes!

101
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,140
Yo, Frankie!

102
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:50,360
How's the wife?

103
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:54,660
It was before capitalism decided to take over the world.

104
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,260
Whoa!

105
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:02,040
Intensive treatment!

106
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,080
Not so tight, boys.

107
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,340
You'll crease the suit.

108
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,900
Get that filthy degenerate out of here.

109
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:12,840
Warden, something's not right.

110
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,420
I'm going with him.

111
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,680
I don't know.

112
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,980
I feel like, Batman, you're a billionaire.

113
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:21,860
I don't know.

114
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,500
I feel like this should be, like, better.

115
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,320
I feel like...

116
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,840
Should this be better funded?

117
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:27,760
I can't...

118
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:29,500
Whoa.

119
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:31,980
Okay, let me fix the...

120
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,540
Let me fix the...

121
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:35,940
Or...

122
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:36,800
Where the fuck...

123
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,080
Where's the sensitivity?

124
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,600
Is this it?

125
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:41,060
Oh my god.

126
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:51,020
were so much simple when it came to settings this is it what
the fuck that's it those are all my settings oh my god those

127
00:11:51,020 --> 00:12:03,200
are all my settings holy shit okay i did not expect my
settings to be like not that much holy shit yeah i feel like

128
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:12,820
there's a lot of like uh like funding wise it feels like is
like Arkham Asylum.

129
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:17,340
Someone is taking too much of the funding from Arkham
Asylum.

130
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:19,600
Oh my god.

131
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:22,140
Okay, turn down voices by like 40.

132
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:25,220
Oh, turn down music by 40%.

133
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:30,740
And then 100% on the sound.

134
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,340
Okay, thank you soundcheck guy.

135
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,400
Just use your mod powers to tell me things.

136
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:37,360
Alright.

137
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,140
Alright, here we go.

138
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,240
That's crazy.

139
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:47,940
I didn't realize there was like these were all the settings
and yeah, I forgot I forgot games were a lot simpler back

140
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,860
then there was like six things

141
00:12:54,660 --> 00:13:05,200
Whoa Okay, not gonna lie If we were going to talk about
budget cuts This was this would be one of the things I would

142
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:20,960
cut Do we really need a picture of you Curing him will
cement my reputation Informed Dr. Young Curing him It's the

143
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:32,860

145
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:48,700
Do we really need this elevator?

146
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,280
Stairs would work.

147
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:57,300
That is such a small elevator.

148
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,720
Stairs would actually work.

149
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,380
Or like a ramp.

150
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,700
We could have had a ramp.

151
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:04,680
Oh my god.

152
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:05,160
Okay.

153
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:06,440
Batman.

154
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:07,780
Financial wise.

155
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,900
This building is terrible.

156
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,780
Financial wise.

157
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,760
He's on it.

158
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,220
That's what ramps are for!

159
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,900
That was like barely one meter.

160
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,800
Oh, zoom.

161
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:29,240
Nice.

162
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,580
What am I zooming in for?

163
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,520
Oh, him?

164
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:41,600
This actually, the graphics actually age so well.

165
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,460
It's called tax cuts.

166
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,340
I want weapons on him at all times.

167
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,560
Do not let him out of your sight.

168
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:53,280
There'll be time enough for you later, Cash.

169
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:58,400
Tick tock, tick tock.

00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,760
When can I run?

176
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:13,200

177
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:17,240

run.

181
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,700
This is...

182
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,220
No, this is...

183
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:52,680
This is...

184
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,320
Oh, now there's stairs.

185
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:00,600
I like how, like, now there's...

186
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,420
Now there's a use for stairs.

187
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:03,640
Satisfactory condition.

188
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:08,140
Looks like he suffered minor lacerations, probably in the
last two hours.

189
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:10,300
There seems to be...

190
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:10,740
Whoa.

191
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,400
Need to take my temperature?

192
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,980
I'd be happy to drop my pants.

193
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,500
I mean, I did just capture him.

194
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:23,680
But that's why there's like minor lacerations.

195
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,220
Wait, how's the sound now?

196
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,160
Soundcheck guy.

197
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,980
He ran out.

198
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,180
Was that Seabloom?

199
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:30,940
Oh my god.

200
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,260
I love Seabloom.

201
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:34,520
He's like, he has the best IMO.

202
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,060
I think he is the best Starscream voice actor.

203
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,500
You heard the lady.

204
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,340
We got another psycho on the way.

205
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:42,860
It's another psycho?

206
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,280
You hear that, Joker?

207
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,640
You're not fucking special.

208
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,260
What the fuck is that?

209
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,840
It must have been one of the guards then.

210
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,280
Is that in their elevator?

211
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,640
What the fuck is that?

212
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,460
Wait, who the fuck is that?

213
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,020
Is that Kroc?

214
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:03,280
Get ready.

215
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,220
What the fuck?

216
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:06,440
Where's his guard?

217
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:11,420
They let him in the elevator unsupervised?

218
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:16,440
Okay, Joker has like 10 guards on him, but Kroc has zero.

219
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:30,440
don't know priorities wise killer croc what's it doing yeah
how did he get here i've got your scent batman who the fuck

220
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:44,920

stop me from killing you batman and rip you apart eat your

221
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:59,880
bones hell i okay okay now he gets two guards okay the guy
that's like you know not restrained gets two cards okay i

222
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:07,740
mean would you be in an elevator with i don't know i feel
like it's very dangerous to like have a villain by himself

223
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:15,740
on an elevator for that long unsupervised in general i feel
like that's like in hindsight that doesn't sound very smart

224
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:26,220
is young bats i still have a trick or two up my sleeve i
mean don't you think it's a little bit funny how a fire at

225
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:37,120
blackgate caused hundreds of my crew to be moved here i
thought i told you to stay quiet yeah frankie you really

226
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:46,600
you're not right here also i really don't think you should
antagonize joker tell me something you've never let me catch

227
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,420
you this easily What are you really after?

228
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,700
Well, nothing much.

229
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,820
Why second elevator?

230
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,680
There's a lot of... Why two TV screens?

231
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:04,660
You're asking about second elevator, but why are there two
TV screens?

232
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:12,660
I think, guys, there's a lot more questions to ask here.

233
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,220
What's he doing?

234
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:16,780
Stay where you are.

235
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,900
Guys, maybe we shouldn't have two TV.

236
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:21,640
What?

237
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,580
Course not, you're fucking Joker.

238
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:39,680
Batman literally was like, I've never caught you this easily
before.

239
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:45,450
Oh, hey, look.

240
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:46,470
See more guards.

241
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:47,110
You're back.

242
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:50,770
You killed three of my crew when you Busted out of here.

243
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:53,190
Okay, wait, let me bring up the overall sound first.

244
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:56,290
We gotta do justice to Mark Hamma.

245
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:59,410
Let me boost up the sound a little bit more.

246
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:00,270
Alright.

247
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:03,430
I hope this is a better sound guy.

248
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:08,190
The budget went to the TVs.

249
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:10,550
Oh?

250
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:12,790
Gordon?

251
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:15,570
Is this Commissioner Gordon?

252
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:16,470
Long night, Jim.

253
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:19,570
Joker invades City Hall and holds the mayor.

254
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:28,210
hostage leaving it to me to juggle swat teams the media and
you yeah it's been a hell of a night hopefully the last one

255
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:37,610

batman arkham staff only i assure you if anyone's qualified

256
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:45,950

the more violent inmates i think he's talking about you bats

257
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:56,250
don't be a stranger fair they are right I mean I'm pretty
sure Batman put all these criminals in the asylum okay he

258
00:20:56,250 --> 00:21:06,310
surrendered almost without a fight I don't like it at least
he's back where he belongs yeah for like I don't know the

259
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:15,190
50th time he's in the asylum I feel like Joker it should be
like one of the villains that should just Just be like, be

260
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:17,470
in a prison just built for him.

261
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:21,250
Batman, there's a door!

262
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:37,010
Oh fuck!

263
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:39,010
There's a door!

264
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:45,510
I set a track and you sprang it gloriously!

265
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:49,270
Get this party started.

266
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:52,490
Alright.

267
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:56,450
Easy.

268
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,310
Wait, are normal grunts in the asylum too?

269
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:13,750
Okay, honestly, I don't know what the grunts were thinking
if that was smart.

270
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:15,550
Alright, I know you were- No!

271
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:18,780
Not done!

272
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,120
I'm not satisfied.

273
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:24,960
Oh, there we go.

274
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:25,400
Thanks.

275
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,020
I'm not satisfied.

276
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:31,220
Get over here.

277
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,860
Avoid damage by countering incoming.

278
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,540
Who needs to counter when I could just beat up everybody?

279
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,800
There's no need to counter when they're all dead.

280
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,120
The bug sapper.

281
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,320
I feel like it's more like the bat sapper.

282
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,140
Alright.

283
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:49,780
Nice.

284
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:50,800
How did I run?

285
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:51,640
No.

286
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:52,000
Oh.

287
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,220
Oh.

288
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,240
Alright.

289
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:04,680
I honestly feel like the asylum should not have like regular
guys in here.

290
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:07,000
Is there a way to run?

291
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,280
Batman, please!

292
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,220
Can you only fucking walk?

293
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:11,540
Oh, okay.

294
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,680
Apparently prowling is faster.

295
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:16,020
Okay.

296
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:19,280
Wait, I could have literally had the door!

297
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:22,600
What the fuck did I smash the window?

298
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,440
They had keys!

299
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:26,480
Wait.

300
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,520
Oh, I can walk.

301
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:30,900
I can run as A.

302
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:33,020
Oh.

303
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:35,300
Why didn't you just come find me?

304
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:35,920
Alright.

305
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:38,460
Oh, okay.

306
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:46,780
Sorry, I had to I had to, like, test that out for a sec.

307
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,280
What's the bio?

308
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:54,320
Police Commissioner James Gordon dedicated his career to
cleaning up the corruption in the Gothen City Police

309
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:54,760
Department.

310
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:58,060
A goal he has come long towards accomplishing.

311
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:04,840
He has been equally tough on crime and in pursuit of making
Gotham City safe for all his citizens.

312
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:13,360
Gordon has forged an uneasy alliance with Gotham's other top
crime fighter, the mysterious vigilante known as Batman.

313
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:15,840
Oh, shit.

314
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,140
Oh, there's a warden.

315
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:18,900
Wait, what are his facts?

316
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,340
Oh, shit, I'm going to dox him.

317
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:22,220
James W.

318
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:22,980

Yeah, this guy definitely looks like a guy that money
launders and bezels money.

325
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:10,740
Everywhere that madman goes, death is sure to follow.

326
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:11,380
Are they okay?

327
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:12,460
They can't be dead.

328
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:14,580
No one kills.

329
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:16,480
Oh, now they tell me how to run.

330
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:20,180

Security breach in level B3.

332
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:23,680
There's no security.

333
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,760
I'm Batman.

334
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:26,640
Security breach.

335
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:29,080
How can there be security breach if I'm Batman?

336
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,320
Nice.

337
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:34,500
Alright.

338
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,380

00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,220
Oh, shit!

Goodbye.

342
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,600
Not gonna lie, these guys have, like, zero armor.

343
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,880
They should not be like...

344
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,860
They should not take this long to beat up.

345
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,560
The Oracle.

346
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:58,700
He's running free in Arkham.

347
00:25:59,020 --> 00:25:59,780
Do you need anything?

348
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,660
Is my dad still there?

349
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,600
Commissioner Gordon is safe.

350
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:05,000
Joker's not far ahead.

351
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:06,460
Wait, then where's this way?

352
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:07,820
Okay.

353
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,460
Which way is the right way?

354
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:11,560
Alright, where's this?

355
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:12,380
This goes.

356
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:14,780
Pacification chamber.

357
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,360
Where does this go?

358
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:18,860
Need contamination.

359
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,320
Oh shit.

360
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,380
Are you a good guy?

361
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:23,540
Hey Batman!

362
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:24,480
Over here!

363
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:25,260
Hello?

364
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:27,620
Eddie!

365
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,480
Why do you have a name?

366
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:31,140
I'm not supposed to humanize you.

367
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:32,060
You're just an NPC.

368
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:33,980
What happened?

369
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,600
Joker happened.

370
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:37,100
You're lucky to be alive.

371
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:38,620
He must have gone this way.

372
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:39,680
Doors jammed.

373
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:40,640
I'll try and get it open.

374
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,380
We need help in pacification.

375
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,300
Oh yeah, I know.

376
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,120
I know she can't walk anymore.

377
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,080
Can you hear me?

378
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,020
I'm with Batman.

379
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:49,580
Hello?

380
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,880
Where are they?

381
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,300
Back down there.

382
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:53,080
Do you need help?

383
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:53,880
No.

384
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:55,380
I work better alone.

385
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:56,060
Yeah.

386
00:26:57,040 --> 00:27:03,520
I work better alone, and also the 500 adopted sons and one
and two adopted daughters.

387
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:10,980
I always, okay, so if you guys don't know, okay, Robin is
not the original Robin.

388
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,240
Dick is not the original Robin.

389
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:18,520
They, like, retconned and was, like, there was actually one
more.

390
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:24,840
I forgot her name, but she was, there was a female Robin
before Dick Robin.

391
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:32,640
And so now now there's two adopted daughters and 500 adopted
sons.

392
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:46,240
He works alone Third there's three adopted daughters Wait

393
00:27:46,240 --> 00:28:01,740

a bat and this guy We can just get another guard.

394
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:03,060
He doesn't have a name.

395
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:06,220
What happens if I just run up?

396
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:06,620
Oh.

397
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,160
Okay.

398
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:10,240
All right, that happens.

399
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:10,860
Okay.

400
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,000
All right.

401
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,160
But he's nameless.

402
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,300
It doesn't matter.

403
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,640
He has no name.

404
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:19,520
Does it really matter what happens to him?

405
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:21,800
There's three?

406
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,440

I could compensate his family.

412
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:17,430
One, one, just one guy.

413
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:19,670
I'm a billionaire.

414
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:22,790
I could just compensate.

415
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:25,010
I could just raise his family.

gargoyles provide a suitable vantage point from which to

00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:12,740
Oh shit, it's the fucking embezzler.

426
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:19,720
Old Sharp has never been happier.

427
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:26,740
In case you ain't figured it out, today is the Joker's big
homecoming and you're the guest of honor.

428
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,980
You have one chance to surrender, Quinn.

429
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,440
Tempting best, but no dice.

430
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:32,220
Now the...

431
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:37,220
Okay.

432
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:44,530
Oh, how is it you're going to give me more updates?

433
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:48,790
Harley Quinn.

434
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:50,910
This is Harleen Quinzel.

435
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:54,870
An Arkham Asylum psychiatrist assigned to treat the Joker.

436
00:31:55,090 --> 00:32:01,250
Dr. Harleen Quinzel instead became obsessively fixated on
her patient, believing herself to be in love with him.

437
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:04,150
She helped him escape confinement and took on her...

438
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:05,830
I can fix her.

439
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:10,390
I took on her own criminal identity as Harley Quinn.

440
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:20,270
Quinn is a violent unprotectual villain who's only not the
fucking $500,000 TVs that we fucking funded for the asylum

441
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:30,550
no don't worry that's why we have four TVs per room because
Quinn nature doesn't sell way mixture just another of his

442
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:38,090
victim a bit of very dangerous one I'm here Arkham Asylum
just vanished off the network he's in control of the

443
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:42,410
security system he's probably Isolated it from the grid
that's not all

444
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:56,620
one sets foot on the fuck now they figured out Also, who the
fuck wants to live in Gotham anymore?

445
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:09,080
I swear to God, I feel like Gotham City has like the
cheapest properties Because like it feels so depressing to

446
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,480
live in Gotham City at this point

447
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:25,000
I don't know After, like, I feel like the average death rate
in Gotham City is, like, at least, like, 500.

448
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:25,820
What the fuck?

449
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:26,540
I'm so fast.

450
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:30,280
It's, like, 500 per day.

451
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:34,160
Where the fuck are they still there?

452
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:38,180
At this point, I just...

453
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:40,200
I just live where Superman lives.

454
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:41,800
Like...

455
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:44,040
At least he can kill.

456
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:48,280
I live in a city where superheroes actually kill.

457
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:50,760
Yeah.

458
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:54,780
That's like a no kill bullshit.

459
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,500
It's just Chicago.

460
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:01,420
I'll live wherever.

461
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,540
I'll be like, do you kill?

462
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:04,780
Alright, nice.

463
00:34:09,930 --> 00:34:11,590
Oh shit, are they dead?

464
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:14,890
Oh no, it's a laughing gas.

465
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:18,450
You can't afford him to travel.

466
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:19,730
What is that stuff?

467
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:23,730
Listen, the room is full of poison gas.

468
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:24,770
Anyone caught in there?

469
00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:25,930
Anyway, let's open it.

470
00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:27,250
Get in there and help them, Batman.

471
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:31,690
All right, how do I do this?

472
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:33,370
Oh, grapple.

473
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:33,910
Where?

474
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:38,140
Whoops.

475
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,020
Sucks to read them, I guess.

476
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:46,040
I can still see people alive in the room.

477
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:48,780
What happens if they all...

478
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:49,900
Can they actually all die?

479
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:51,120
Oh, God.

480
00:34:53,810 --> 00:34:55,310
Just walk away!

481
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:03,960
Just stop looking!

482
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:06,780
Sir, look away!

483
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:12,760
Stop!

484
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:14,820
It's just trauma!

485
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:18,580
You don't have to look!

486
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,380
Oh, they can?

487
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,020
Oh, shit.

488
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,260
I was looking too hard.

489
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:25,580
Joker's been planning this.

490
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:26,820
You can't.

491
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:29,180
You're gonna let Steve die.

492
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,220
Who gives a fuck about?

493
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:48,260
Steve you're gonna be fine she doesn't even have a name he's
literally guard oh shit how the fuck do I get up here oh

Trophy?

496
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:05,500
Steve!

497
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:09,700
Steve, look, I'm sorry, but there is important matters.

498
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,140
Like, how do I get this trophy?

499
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:14,500
Okay, we gotta go downstairs.

500
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:19,280
But then there's laughing gas, so we gotta figure out how to
not get laughing gas.

501
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,240
Look up.

502
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:24,160
Look, I need to figure out the gas!

503
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:25,280
Oh, there's Steve!

504
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,380
There he is.

505
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:29,140
Trophy over Steve.

506
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:34,080
Yes, I'm I've never been a completionist, but today's the
day I changed.

507
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:38,240
You're the worst Batman ever?

508
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:43,780
Look, Batman has already been the worst Batman ever because
he doesn't kill.

509
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:45,200
Okay.

510
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:52,660
If he killed Joker 10 years ago, we would not be here.

511
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:58,860
So no matter what I do, Batman is already the worst Batman
he can be.

512
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:02,800
Yay!

513
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,140

514
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,460

00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:08,300
Okay, I cut over here.

516
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:12,270
Oh!

517
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:13,150
God!

518
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:14,510
I don't kill!

519
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:16,750
But I do give brain damage.

520
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:20,470
Clearly...

521
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:22,310
Clearly that's the best alternative.

522
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:24,590
Use to remove toxins...

523
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:26,750
Okay, but how do I remove it?

524
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:29,050
Terminal use...

525
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:30,750
There's the extractor control point.

526
00:37:31,370 --> 00:37:31,870
Oh fuck!

527
00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:32,410
Oh fuck!

528
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:34,190
Oh, shit!

529
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:38,810
Okay.

530
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:40,650
Sorry, I tripped.

531
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:41,310
I tripped.

532
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:43,110
Everything's okay.

533
00:37:43,330 --> 00:37:43,670
I tripped.

534
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:45,050
Okay.

535
00:37:46,450 --> 00:37:50,050
You did a bad smash glass to activate it.

536
00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:51,730
Can I just smash it like this?

537
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:52,950
Nice.

538
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:00,620
Sorry.

539
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:01,140
Okay.

540
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,320
I tripped.

541
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:07,580
Yay!

542
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:08,600
I did it!

543
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:12,540
The casualty's not that bad.

544
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:21,280
Alright, now I can get the trophy.

545
00:38:24,850 --> 00:38:25,630
I did it!

546
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:27,350
Nobody doesn't stand a chance.

547
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:28,370
Yeah!

548
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:30,190
Look at that.

549
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:33,110
Sucks for all those other guys that died.

550
00:38:33,350 --> 00:38:33,790
But, woo!

551
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:34,950
I did it!

552
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:36,690
Yeah!

553
00:38:37,330 --> 00:38:39,070
Okay, how the fuck do I get the trophy?

554
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:40,530

Plus 50?

563
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:20,320
Is that my currency?

564
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,760
You need a gadget that you don't have yet?

565
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,100
I'm Batman.

566
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,580
What do you mean I don't have yet?

567
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:28,640
I have money.

568
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:32,340
I can fix all my problems with money.

569
00:39:36,410 --> 00:39:36,930
Oh, wait.

570
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:37,650
There's another one.

571
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:39,130
Oh.

572
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:40,710

573
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:41,670
Oh, I did.

574
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:44,390
Nice.

575
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:44,910
Okay.

576
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:47,510
I wish I knew that earlier.

577
00:39:47,610 --> 00:39:48,170
Backseaters!

578
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:49,910
You could have told me this earlier!

579
00:39:53,870 --> 00:39:54,430
Slender.

580
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:56,910
Those are the bat bugs.

581
00:39:57,830 --> 00:39:58,490
Wait, what's this?

582
00:39:59,210 --> 00:40:00,210
Oh, is that the laughing gas?

583
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:02,210
Okay, causing a slow and painful death.

584
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:03,010
Oops.

585
00:40:04,270 --> 00:40:04,850
Ha ha.

586
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:06,610
What the fuck gave him?

587
00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:07,770
Paint cans.

588
00:40:10,810 --> 00:40:11,990
Oh, bat teeth.

589
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:13,870
Oops.

590
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:14,610
Okay.

591
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:14,910
Sorry.

592
00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:15,710
Sorry.

593
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:19,190
Thank God they're unlimited.

594
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:20,650
My budget.

595
00:40:20,810 --> 00:40:22,830
50 million on Battle Rags.

596
00:40:25,930 --> 00:40:26,550
Alright, guys.

597
00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:28,010
Someone help me budget this.

00:40:28,450 --> 00:40:28,970
What the fuck?

599
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:29,970
Where did you come from?

600
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:33,330
I wish Batman has guns.

601
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:37,410
There we go.

602
00:40:38,290 --> 00:40:38,690
He's dead?

603
00:40:40,850 --> 00:40:42,150
Oh, he is definitely dead.

604
00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:43,110
Oh, fuck.

605
00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:44,030
He is definitely dead.

606
00:40:47,560 --> 00:41:00,380

00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,740
After 200 years.

610
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:28,700
Who's that?

611
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:32,320
What the fuck is that?

612
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:39,860
What the fuck is this guy?

613
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:47,770
Boom.

614
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:48,690
Boom.

615
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:52,690
Double tap direction to evade.

616
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:53,790
Holy shit!

617
00:41:53,930 --> 00:41:55,310
You can just throw people?

618
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:56,030
Ow!

619
00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:02,110
Okay, evade.

620
00:42:03,430 --> 00:42:04,330
Where the fuck?

621
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:06,910
What do I do?

622
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:09,210
What do I do?

623
00:42:12,350 --> 00:42:13,410
Oh, shit!

624
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:18,550
Okay, don't worry.

625
00:42:19,390 --> 00:42:20,690
I'm unlimited veterans!

626
00:42:21,870 --> 00:42:22,990

627
00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:25,910
Fucking punch me?

628
00:42:27,490 --> 00:42:27,950
Okay.

when I can throw better eggs oh shit how the fuck is my fist

630
00:42:40,890 --> 00:42:50,790
stronger than metal like you're right just call Superman
honestly I feel like all my problems could just be fixed if

631
00:42:50,790 --> 00:42:58,190
I call Superman like I need to make sure like pride and ego
should not be wait was Is that it?

632
00:43:04,090 --> 00:43:05,410
Oh, fuck.

633
00:43:14,910 --> 00:43:19,170
How is my fist stronger than fucking metal?

634
00:43:21,230 --> 00:43:25,470
From sheer physics, my battle run should be stronger.

635
00:43:26,910 --> 00:43:28,590
Physics w- that's a blade!

636
00:43:32,350 --> 00:43:35,570
Oh, you're getting too predictable bats.

637
00:43:36,330 --> 00:43:39,570
Well, I'd love to stay in chat, but I have a party to
organize.

638
00:43:39,770 --> 00:43:40,830
Throw your bat rings!

639
00:43:41,590 --> 00:43:43,070
Bat-bat, what are you doing?

640
00:43:43,390 --> 00:43:44,790
He can't dodge five!

641
00:43:45,910 --> 00:43:50,510
He got the money punch.

642
00:43:52,810 --> 00:43:54,770
That is a bat run.

643
00:43:56,210 --> 00:43:57,610
Yeah, this does not look nice.

644
00:44:00,090 --> 00:44:00,650
Yeah.

645
00:44:01,610 --> 00:44:03,150
It's not natural.

646
00:44:04,970 --> 00:44:05,490
Oh, shit.

647
00:44:06,130 --> 00:44:07,010
I can upgrade.

648
00:44:07,730 --> 00:44:07,950
All right.

649
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:11,290
You have unlocked a Wayne Tech upgrade.

650
00:44:12,870 --> 00:44:14,970
Batman ignores physics.

651
00:44:20,070 --> 00:44:21,610
Bad Tokyo's backseat.

652
00:44:21,910 --> 00:44:23,350
Yes, because it's stupid.

653
00:44:23,810 --> 00:44:26,190
What did he throw his batter eggs?

654
00:44:26,950 --> 00:44:28,270
He could have ended it all.

655
00:44:28,330 --> 00:44:29,650
I don't know if he doesn't want to kill it.

656
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:31,590
Fucking throw it at his fucking leg or something.

657
00:44:31,610 --> 00:44:42,010
some shit like it doesn't have to be lethal okay fill the xp

662
00:45:21,270 --> 00:45:27,730
control bataran sorry apparently fucking physics sucks in
this game that bat arounds mean nothing.

663
00:45:29,550 --> 00:45:30,670
Invert takedown.

664
00:45:30,950 --> 00:45:35,770
Okay, allows Batman to swoop down and grab a stainless as
they pass under gargoyles and leave them.

665
00:45:36,110 --> 00:45:36,170
Oh!

666
00:45:36,430 --> 00:45:37,230
Wait, that's so cool.

667
00:45:37,850 --> 00:45:38,170
Okay.

668
00:45:38,830 --> 00:45:42,510
I can just, like, be up top and not have to worry.

669
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:47,930
Nice.

670
00:45:49,370 --> 00:45:51,690
Alright, pick up the Riddler trophy.

671
00:45:52,090 --> 00:45:53,150
Is there anything else here?

672
00:45:54,010 --> 00:45:55,090
Detective mode.

673
00:45:55,390 --> 00:45:56,450
Anything else I'm missing?

674
00:45:56,490 --> 00:45:57,710
Who is this?

675
00:45:59,090 --> 00:45:59,570
Is this Eddie?

676
00:46:00,570 --> 00:46:00,690
Eddie?

677
00:46:01,010 --> 00:46:03,050
Oh, sorry, you don't matter too.

678
00:46:03,370 --> 00:46:05,230
Wait, he literally has Eddie's eyes!

679
00:46:08,130 --> 00:46:09,910
Oh, Jerry has a name.

680
00:46:10,370 --> 00:46:11,370
Joker went through that door.

681
00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:12,950
What's on the other side?

682
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:14,990
We call it extreme isolation.

683
00:46:15,570 --> 00:46:17,450
Only way in is via the transport system.

684
00:46:17,590 --> 00:46:20,990
I love how they gave Jerry a name, but not guard number 20.

685
00:46:24,310 --> 00:46:25,470
Alright, nice.

686
00:46:26,490 --> 00:46:37,570

joker just in case you were planning on a range

689
00:46:59,630 --> 00:47:00,250
No!

690
00:47:01,550 --> 00:47:02,170
No!

691
00:47:02,890 --> 00:47:04,590
Officer Balls is corrupt?

692
00:47:05,410 --> 00:47:08,050
Gordon, your whole job was to deal with corruption!

693
00:47:12,010 --> 00:47:14,290
Have you tried to follow me?

694
00:47:14,310 --> 00:47:15,150
He dies.

695
00:47:15,310 --> 00:47:16,150
Jesus Christ.

696
00:47:16,850 --> 00:47:18,770
Okay, Gordon's terrible at his job, too.

697
00:47:19,950 --> 00:47:23,250
I should go back to the holding cells.

698
00:47:23,750 --> 00:47:24,830
Balls wasn't too smart.

699
00:47:25,410 --> 00:47:28,870
Gordon, your one fucking job was to deal with of corruption!

700
00:47:29,390 --> 00:47:30,690
How did this happen?

701
00:47:35,230 --> 00:47:39,490
Alright, we gotta go locate and analyze the holding cells
for evidence.

702
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:39,890
Alright.

703
00:47:40,550 --> 00:47:42,090
I gotta look at that map a lot.

704
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:42,810
Where's the teeth?

705
00:47:44,250 --> 00:47:44,870
No, my XP.

706
00:47:45,150 --> 00:47:45,570
Joker's escaped.

707
00:47:45,850 --> 00:47:46,850
He sealed himself off.

708
00:47:47,310 --> 00:47:48,470
He's got your father.

709
00:47:48,950 --> 00:47:49,390
Dad.

710
00:47:49,890 --> 00:47:51,250
Don't worry, I'm getting him back.

711
00:47:51,390 --> 00:47:52,290
He's doing his best.

712
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:55,270
At this point, I feel like we have to hire another
commissioner.

713
00:47:55,630 --> 00:47:56,330
Joker will not win.

714
00:47:56,830 --> 00:47:57,470
I won't let him.

715
00:47:57,950 --> 00:48:12,670
I'm starting where he was taken if he was a good cop He
would not be stationed at Gotham City If you think about it

716
00:48:13,550 --> 00:48:21,310
You think about it, he would have 100% been promoted outside
of Gotham City Wait, do I have like enough to upgrade for

717
00:48:21,310 --> 00:48:21,970
anything else?

718
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:32,330
No, I know Like he would have been stationed in metropolis I
bet you're wondering how I did it How do you do it?

719
00:48:36,350 --> 00:48:37,370
Not gonna lie.

720
00:48:38,130 --> 00:48:39,510
Batman should never...

721
00:48:39,510 --> 00:48:42,850
I should not have the title of Great Detective with my track
record.

722
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:48,560

This is a bigger issue than it should be.

Oh, throw about until the end time.

736
00:49:49,330 --> 00:49:49,970

00:53:06,050 --> 00:53:07,150
Oh my god, Joker.

778
00:53:07,670 --> 00:53:09,250
He's a computer engineer, too.

779
00:53:09,350 --> 00:53:10,090
He can hack things.

780
00:53:10,110 --> 00:53:12,870
Oh my god, he can do everything.

781
00:53:14,330 --> 00:53:15,910
Oh, enemy?

782
00:53:16,910 --> 00:53:17,630
Are you a good guy?

783
00:53:17,750 --> 00:53:18,070
I can't see.

784
00:53:18,170 --> 00:53:19,470
I'm in detective mode.

785
00:53:22,790 --> 00:53:23,430
Jury,

00:53:26,830 --> 00:53:27,430

787
00:53:28,970 --> 00:53:29,650
Be quiet.

788
00:53:29,870 --> 00:53:30,810
I'm detectiving.

789
00:53:31,150 --> 00:53:33,170
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, B-Man.

790
00:53:33,450 --> 00:53:36,650
Mr. J doesn't want you following us just yet.

791
00:53:38,530 --> 00:53:39,570
I missed teeth?

792
00:53:39,810 --> 00:53:40,270
No!

793
00:53:40,870 --> 00:53:41,370
No!

794
00:53:42,530 --> 00:53:43,450
Not the teeth!

795
00:53:51,610 --> 00:53:52,850
Oh, shit.

796
00:54:00,450 --> 00:54:02,230
I can fix her.

797
00:54:07,350 --> 00:54:08,250
Where's the teeth?

798
00:54:09,110 --> 00:54:09,570
Oh, teeth!

799
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:11,650
Give me a sec, Harley.

800
00:54:16,550 --> 00:54:18,790
Harley, I literally have grapple!

801
00:54:19,970 --> 00:54:23,370
If I want to follow them, I'll need to do this the
old-fashioned way.

802
00:54:26,150 --> 00:54:28,070
Harley, I literally have grappling.

803
00:54:30,310 --> 00:54:34,030
Like, how is that going to stop me, Harley?

804
00:54:35,510 --> 00:54:37,370
Wait, wait, where the stairs goes?

805
00:54:37,550 --> 00:54:38,330
Wait, there's stairs?

806
00:54:38,830 --> 00:54:40,010
Harley, there's stairs!

807
00:54:44,690 --> 00:54:46,130
Oh my god, you have a name!

808
00:54:46,270 --> 00:54:46,970
Henry Smith!

809
00:54:47,130 --> 00:54:48,310
This is Joker's doing.

810
00:54:49,250 --> 00:54:49,930
Who else?

811
00:54:50,430 --> 00:54:51,970
I told him he's a monster.

812
00:54:52,650 --> 00:54:54,370
It's slower, though.

813
00:54:58,510 --> 00:55:07,850
all right let's see you know what let's try to grapple first
it's it's faster than stairs i feel like that is a lot

814
00:55:07,850 --> 00:55:19,770
faster unless wait are you trying to tell me there's no more
else to grapple no then what's the point what well shimmy oh

I know you can hear me.

817
00:55:27,690 --> 00:55:30,030
I've got a little something for you to listen to.

818
00:55:30,330 --> 00:55:30,990
What is a joker?

819
00:55:38,660 --> 00:55:40,800
Let's have a listen, shall we?

820
00:55:41,260 --> 00:55:42,660
Hey, Frank, breathe in.

821
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:44,680
Joker's got more men on the way.

822
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:46,360
They're coming around the front of the asylum.

823
00:55:46,620 --> 00:55:47,180
Gotta stop them.

824
00:55:47,340 --> 00:55:47,500
Get in.

825
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:48,580
Quick, get over there.

826
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:50,360
Come on, everyone.

827
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:51,280
Cover the main entrance.

828
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:52,280
Oh.

829
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:54,900
This is important.

830
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:56,140
Oh!

831
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:57,320
Bulls!

832
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:58,460
Frank, what are you doing?

833
00:55:58,580 --> 00:55:59,020
Bulls!

834
00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:00,100
No, the corruption!

835
00:56:04,660 --> 00:56:05,540
Wait,

836
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:25,640
is Joker a cop?

837
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:28,840
No!

838
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:30,940
Oh, I'm alive!

839
00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:34,000
Okay, everything's fine.

840
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:36,520
Yay!

841
00:56:37,020 --> 00:56:38,600
They're dancing!

842
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:40,340
They're cute!

843
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:40,420
No!

844
00:56:40,420 --> 00:56:40,540
No!

845
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:40,560
Okay, everything's fine.

846
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:40,940
No!

847
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:45,060
Okay,

848
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:51,240
let's see.

849
00:56:52,820 --> 00:56:55,360
Oh, let's shoot me again, Joker guy.

850
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:00,880
I'm gonna say...

851
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:05,900
That's a little...

852
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:06,780
A little awkward.

853
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:11,680
Alright, how the fuck do I get to the fucking...

854
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:22,840
Riddler trophy doesn't really matter okay guys under for
under for achievements what does the trophy get me what what

855
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:27,660
does the trophy get me other than achievements I need a no

856
00:57:32,580 --> 00:57:41,500
just for unlocks what does it unlock nothing okay I'll never
look at another true oh XP oh fuck okay I need XP actually

857
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:47,900
never mind XP is nice run towards low walls or fences to
climb them Oh, like this?

858
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:49,060
Nice.

859
00:57:56,730 --> 00:57:57,610
Let's see.

860
00:57:58,910 --> 00:58:00,750
God, I'm so confused right now.

861
00:58:01,530 --> 00:58:03,090
There's too many entrances.

862
00:58:05,450 --> 00:58:07,130
The feeling of accomplishment.

863
00:58:09,010 --> 00:58:11,730
Look, I'm already doing it for the achievements.

864
00:58:12,050 --> 00:58:13,330
I mean, for the XP, okay?

865
00:58:13,430 --> 00:58:14,310
Is that not enough?

866
00:58:18,030 --> 00:58:18,790
Actually, I don't know.

867
00:58:18,850 --> 00:58:19,450
I'm going to go through.

868
00:58:19,650 --> 00:58:21,150
There's so many areas to go to.

869
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:28,560
Okay.

870
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:32,300
Where the fuck do I go?

871
00:58:33,340 --> 00:58:34,500
Holly, why the fuck did you...

872
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:35,540
I should have taken the stairs.

873
00:58:36,260 --> 00:58:37,420
I should have taken the stairs.

874
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:44,120
God fucking damn it.

875
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:47,500
The stairs would have been easier.

876
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:50,120
The stairs would have been 100% easier.

877
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:51,520
Where am I?

878
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:52,920
Where?

879
00:58:54,180 --> 00:58:55,020

I don't have the upgrades, guys.

885
00:59:32,700 --> 00:59:33,580
I'm poor, apparently.

886
00:59:35,820 --> 00:59:36,080
Escape?

887
00:59:37,860 --> 00:59:38,280
Oh.

888
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:39,920
I did it.

889
00:59:46,070 --> 00:59:47,350
Mine, uh...

890
00:59:47,350 --> 00:59:49,370
I did not do it.

891
00:59:49,770 --> 00:59:52,150
I did not do it.

892
00:59:52,990 --> 00:59:55,870
Oh, shit.

893
00:59:56,170 --> 00:59:57,310
No, they're alive.

894
00:59:57,870 --> 00:59:58,270
Okay.

895
01:00:00,190 --> 01:00:01,310
Where the fuck?

896
01:00:03,070 --> 01:00:04,270
Where do I go?

897
01:00:05,270 --> 01:00:05,790
Shimmy?

898
01:00:06,290 --> 01:00:07,270
Wait, oh, shimmy!

899
01:00:08,330 --> 01:00:09,390
Oh my god, there's a shimmy!

900
01:00:10,970 --> 01:00:11,890
I'm learning.

901
01:00:12,190 --> 01:00:13,310
Guys, I'm getting better.

902
01:00:16,150 --> 01:00:20,590
Why didn't they appoint fucking Superman in Gotham City?

903
01:00:23,110 --> 01:00:26,050
I feel like I'm just in the wrong city at this point.

904
01:00:28,350 --> 01:00:37,790
I feel like if the crime rate is like 80 i think i'm doing i
think my i'm not doing a very good job i don't think i was

905
01:00:37,790 --> 01:00:52,700

Warning.

907
01:01:04,740 --> 01:01:07,520
Arkham intensive treatment is under emergency law.

908
01:01:09,810 --> 01:01:11,550
But don't give Harley is evil.

909
01:01:12,570 --> 01:01:12,570
Why?

910
01:01:12,990 --> 01:01:15,250
Because only evil people are hot.

911
01:01:19,130 --> 01:01:20,270
Let's see.

912
01:01:21,430 --> 01:01:22,330
Oh, there it is.

913
01:01:23,450 --> 01:01:24,390
Jesus Christ.

914
01:01:24,750 --> 01:01:25,090
Sometimes.

915
01:01:30,410 --> 01:01:30,690
Alright.

916
01:01:31,070 --> 01:01:31,490
I got it.

917
01:01:31,530 --> 01:01:32,290
I figured it out.

918
01:01:33,890 --> 01:01:35,510

921
01:02:11,010 --> 01:02:11,150
Oh, shit.

922
01:02:11,150 --> 01:02:14,590
Where my own curse is to forever remain in the shadows.

923
01:02:15,410 --> 01:02:18,950
My story is carved into the very soul of Arkham.

924
01:02:19,790 --> 01:02:24,470
And will only be revealed to those dedicated enough to
discover it.

925
01:02:25,510 --> 01:02:26,230
Oh, shit.

926
01:02:27,430 --> 01:02:28,830
All right, where is it?

927
01:02:28,910 --> 01:02:30,230
Backseaters, it's your time.

928
01:02:33,030 --> 01:02:33,710
Okay.

929
01:02:34,890 --> 01:02:35,570
Hello.

930
01:02:36,950 --> 01:02:37,910
All right.

931
01:02:38,730 --> 01:02:40,790
Time to beat up goo number five.

932
01:02:41,390 --> 01:02:41,490
Oh.

933
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:45,740
All right.

934
01:02:46,140 --> 01:02:46,740
Hey, look.

935
01:02:47,660 --> 01:02:50,140
Billionaires are not supposed to be, like, good fighters.

936
01:02:50,540 --> 01:02:51,820
We just throw money at things.

937
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:52,600
Oh, shit.

938
01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:54,080
All right.

939
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:55,420
Don't let him hit you, you idiot.

940
01:02:56,340 --> 01:02:56,760
Goodbye.

941
01:02:57,960 --> 01:02:59,340
Where's my gun update?

942
01:03:04,980 --> 01:03:05,460
Nope.

943
01:03:05,780 --> 01:03:07,280
Not yet, but I'm getting close.

944
01:03:08,260 --> 01:03:09,440
Twain tried to slow me down.

945
01:03:09,940 --> 01:03:11,100
Dropped an elevator on me.

946
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:11,780
Did it work?

947
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:13,620
Of course not.

948
01:03:13,900 --> 01:03:15,600
I'll get back to you when I reach the end of the trail.

949
01:03:17,020 --> 01:03:17,240
Alright.

950
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:17,820
Teeth.

951
01:03:23,810 --> 01:03:24,810
Oh, bent.

952
01:03:26,190 --> 01:03:29,050
There's like so many passageways around here.

953
01:03:29,570 --> 01:03:31,070
I'm getting so confused.

954
01:03:31,550 --> 01:03:34,430
I mean, there's a lie.

955
01:03:36,470 --> 01:03:38,330
Okay, locked, locked.

956
01:03:39,830 --> 01:03:40,750
Nice alcohol.

957
01:03:42,310 --> 01:03:44,310
All right, we have to go to the event then.

958
01:03:46,190 --> 01:03:46,430
Oh, no.

959
01:03:46,550 --> 01:03:48,470
I feel like I'm going to get more lost later.

960
01:03:49,170 --> 01:03:50,370
I have a feeling.

961
01:03:52,270 --> 01:03:52,970
Whoa, shit!

962
01:03:53,670 --> 01:03:54,670
Wait, he has a gun?

963
01:03:54,970 --> 01:03:57,770
Wait, who's that?

964
01:04:02,290 --> 01:04:03,370
That's not fair.

965
01:04:05,750 --> 01:04:06,230
Batman!

966
01:04:07,010 --> 01:04:09,730
Is it people are dying and you don't want to use a gun?

967
01:04:11,810 --> 01:04:12,290
Okay.

968
01:04:12,310 --> 01:04:15,430
It should be a life for a life if they get to kill two
people.

969
01:04:15,570 --> 01:04:19,390
I get to kill two people like I feel like no I can run.

970
01:04:19,470 --> 01:04:20,170
Oh shit.

971
01:04:20,230 --> 01:04:20,890
I cannot run.

972
01:04:21,110 --> 01:04:22,370
I'm not faster than a bullet

973
01:04:29,770 --> 01:04:38,690
Guys I found out Batman's not faster than bullets I know
I'll calibrate the cowls vision mode to isolate great.

Oh shit!

979
01:05:17,230 --> 01:05:17,490
No!

980
01:05:17,590 --> 01:05:18,310
That's not silent!

981
01:05:21,910 --> 01:05:24,410
Okay, but what if I do this?

982
01:05:25,050 --> 01:05:25,230
Oh!

983
01:05:27,050 --> 01:05:29,130
I don't think they like that.

984
01:05:29,790 --> 01:05:32,410
I don't think...

985
01:05:32,410 --> 01:05:33,790
Okay.

986
01:05:34,150 --> 01:05:36,070
Wait, they're not... God damn it.

987
01:05:36,270 --> 01:05:38,290
That's so fucking weak.

988
01:05:39,150 --> 01:05:39,750
No!

989
01:05:40,470 --> 01:05:41,550
What the...

990
01:05:42,310 --> 01:05:43,810
Okay.

991
01:05:52,180 --> 01:05:53,820
They will never know.

992
01:05:58,340 --> 01:06:02,560
But they'll never know.

993
01:06:04,220 --> 01:06:04,620
They'll never know.

994
01:06:05,860 --> 01:06:06,360
Stuff.

995
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:09,660
Hey.

996
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:12,960
I wonder where Batman is.

997
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:17,760
Okay.

998
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:18,380
Oh, she!

999
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:19,080
Ah!

1000
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:22,640
Sorry.

1001
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:25,720
I got a little cocky there.

1002
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:30,000
Okay.

1003
01:06:33,100 --> 01:06:34,660
That's a little stupid.

1004
01:06:35,640 --> 01:06:36,860
I'm gonna lie.

1005
01:06:39,300 --> 01:06:41,000
That's a little fucking stupid.

1006
01:06:42,120 --> 01:06:43,260
Wait, there's a person there.

1007
01:06:44,020 --> 01:06:44,620
No problem.

1008
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:45,920
They'll never know.

1009
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:47,020
They'll never know.

1010
01:06:56,180 --> 01:06:58,700
Yes, we need to set a trap.

1011
01:07:02,260 --> 01:07:04,820
I suppose I better warn my boy.

1012
01:07:09,290 --> 01:07:10,690
It'll be a nice surprise.

1013
01:07:12,470 --> 01:07:14,310
I know I think they'll enjoy it too.

1014
01:07:14,850 --> 01:07:16,510
I mean, they already have guns.

1015
01:07:17,150 --> 01:07:18,330
Don't worry, they'll be fine.

1016
01:07:18,990 --> 01:07:19,510
Wayne Tech.

1017
01:07:19,670 --> 01:07:20,870
Wait, does this develop by me?

1018
01:07:21,590 --> 01:07:22,830
Are you considered hack proof?

1019
01:07:23,290 --> 01:07:23,770
Currently inactive.

1020
01:07:24,090 --> 01:07:25,710
That is a fucking lie.

1021
01:07:26,130 --> 01:07:28,890
The Joker literally hacked several things.

1022
01:07:29,550 --> 01:07:30,910
What do you mean?

1023
01:07:31,730 --> 01:07:32,670
Wayne Tech.

1024
01:07:33,730 --> 01:07:34,710
Wayne Tech!

1025
01:07:34,890 --> 01:07:36,970
You are not, I'm not a great billionaire.

1026
01:07:40,590 --> 01:07:46,090
To be fair, I feel like I like as Bruce Wayne, I definitely
outsource everything.

1027
01:07:47,990 --> 01:07:57,930
There's no way I have enough time to run a company if I'm
out here doing all this all right what do we need to upgrade

1028
01:07:57,930 --> 01:08:09,770

Where is that?

1032
01:08:25,730 --> 01:08:30,290
What we've learned is that batter heads don't fucking work.

1033
01:08:33,410 --> 01:08:34,590
Which one's the best one?

1034
01:08:36,590 --> 01:08:36,810
Army?

1035
01:08:38,390 --> 01:08:39,410
Critical strikes?

1036
01:08:39,670 --> 01:08:40,550

1037
01:08:41,210 --> 01:08:42,010
Oh, there you go.

1038
01:08:42,710 --> 01:08:43,870
Wait, I don't have enough.

1039
01:08:44,410 --> 01:08:45,190
How much is that?

1040
01:08:46,150 --> 01:08:46,990
I'm broke?

1041
01:08:47,330 --> 01:08:49,190
How the fuck do I up on the deck?

1042
01:08:51,010 --> 01:08:54,210
Sorry guys, I don't have enough money apparently.

1043
01:08:58,670 --> 01:09:01,170
How much XP are this?

1044
01:09:05,710 --> 01:09:08,650
There's no- I- I have a thousand bat bucks!

1045
01:09:09,270 --> 01:09:13,510
$1,000 is- okay, what the fuck is the exchange rate of bat
bucks?

1046
01:09:14,690 --> 01:09:18,730
Apparently the bat bucks exchange rate is pretty fucking
poor right now.

1047
01:09:19,110 --> 01:09:22,820
Uncle Jay!

1048
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:24,860
We have an escaped patient!

1049
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:35,360
Oh my dangerous, I don't even have a gun!

1050
01:09:39,690 --> 01:09:42,190
I don't even- okay, I don't even kill.

1051
01:09:43,790 --> 01:09:46,670
I should not be dangerous at all if I can't even kill.

1052
01:09:47,910 --> 01:09:49,110
Boop, boop, boop, boop.

1053
01:09:51,370 --> 01:09:51,550
Oh.

1054
01:09:56,810 --> 01:09:59,750
I just slap him once and that's good.

1055
01:10:00,610 --> 01:10:01,950
But let's see.

1056
01:10:12,230 --> 01:10:14,390
All right, how do I kill this guy?

1057
01:10:14,610 --> 01:10:15,130
Inverted takedown.

1058
01:10:15,350 --> 01:10:15,810
There it is!

1059
01:10:16,570 --> 01:10:16,790
Oh!

1060
01:10:17,930 --> 01:10:18,230
Nice.

1061
01:10:22,610 --> 01:10:25,310
Okay, not gonna lie, this can actually kill a person.

1062
01:10:27,170 --> 01:10:28,690
Batman, you idiot!

1063
01:10:29,650 --> 01:10:36,970
If they leave hanging way too long, the blood will go all
the way to the head, and then he'll die!

1064
01:10:38,350 --> 01:10:38,790
Batman!

1065
01:10:39,930 --> 01:10:41,190
Oh, shit.

1066
01:10:43,290 --> 01:10:45,910
It's just a slower death, Pepe!

1067
01:10:48,490 --> 01:10:49,970
Don't you understand?

1068
01:10:52,490 --> 01:10:53,730
Oh, he doesn't look up.

1069
01:10:53,970 --> 01:10:55,130
Gamers don't look up.

1070
01:10:55,810 --> 01:10:57,230
No, no, it'll be fine.

1071
01:10:57,530 --> 01:10:58,330
Don't worry.

1072
01:11:01,610 --> 01:11:02,950
PimD doesn't look up, right?

1073
01:11:03,230 --> 01:11:03,890
Ooh, glad kick.

1074
01:11:05,990 --> 01:11:06,870
It's fine.

1075
01:11:07,130 --> 01:11:08,150
It's Oscar.

1076
01:11:10,030 --> 01:11:11,970
But who's gonna let him down?

1077
01:11:12,110 --> 01:11:14,010
There's no guards here.

1078
01:11:19,690 --> 01:11:22,750
Batman's gonna get up, his heart's gonna stop Batman!

1079
01:11:27,390 --> 01:11:30,150
Gravity killed him, not Batman!

1080
01:11:33,570 --> 01:11:34,490
That's true.

1081
01:11:35,010 --> 01:11:36,990
It's not my fault, it's gravity's fault.

1082
01:11:38,510 --> 01:11:39,490
Gamish, don't look up!

1083
01:11:42,510 --> 01:11:43,230
Oh

1084
01:11:46,610 --> 01:11:51,990
Oh, shit, please I'm still beating someone out please no

1085
01:11:56,190 --> 01:11:58,430

I have to listen to him?

1094
01:12:36,430 --> 01:12:37,190
It's fine.

1095
01:12:37,950 --> 01:12:41,150
There's no way he'll hear this That's fine.

1096
01:12:41,290 --> 01:12:42,010
He doesn't hear this.

1097
01:12:42,390 --> 01:12:42,550
Don't worry.

1098
01:12:42,650 --> 01:12:54,210

Is this supposed to do a stealth section?

1104
01:14:06,330 --> 01:14:10,590
No, we don't stealth here if we've learned how Doki plays.

1105
01:14:11,050 --> 01:14:11,690
There's no...

1106
01:14:11,690 --> 01:14:12,950
Wait, why am I not on the gargoyle?

1107
01:14:14,530 --> 01:14:16,510
There's no such thing as stealth.

1108
01:14:19,730 --> 01:14:21,150
All right, let's see.

1109
01:14:21,170 --> 01:14:24,550

These are hardcore psychotics.

Most would rather kill you than speak to you.

1151
01:17:18,160 --> 01:17:20,420
One or two of them will enjoy it too.

1152
01:17:21,580 --> 01:17:22,580
Be careful.

1153
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:27,080
Oh shit, the Riddler.

Don't cut yourself on this sharply observed portrait.

1181
01:19:52,230 --> 01:19:53,050
Object detected?

1182
01:19:53,730 --> 01:19:54,390

1183
01:19:54,850 --> 01:19:58,590

Oh, shit.

01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:18,460
The Riddler broke the screen, but don't worry, we're back.

01:20:19,100 --> 01:20:20,360
Oh, isn't this portrait?

I would have expected a child to work that one out, let
alone the world's greatest detective.

1201
01:20:34,020 --> 01:20:34,820
Where did I win?

1202
01:20:37,100 --> 01:20:38,660
What the fuck did I win?

1203
01:20:41,820 --> 01:20:45,080
Whereas you don't know Jack about the utility corridor.

1204
01:20:45,560 --> 01:20:47,240
Jack, about Gotham.

1208
01:20:55,220 --> 01:20:56,560
What the fuck did I win?

1209
01:20:57,640 --> 01:20:58,600
Okay, let's see.

1210
01:20:58,680 --> 01:21:00,100
Do I have enough for upgrades yet?

1211
01:21:01,080 --> 01:21:02,600
Oh, I need like $20.

1212
01:21:03,880 --> 01:21:04,480
Oh,

1213
01:21:08,750 --> 01:21:09,010
XP?

1214
01:21:09,470 --> 01:21:10,230
I love XP.

1215
01:21:11,290 --> 01:21:12,910
Anything else I can do?

1216
01:21:14,290 --> 01:21:14,650
Hello.

1217
01:21:14,870 --> 01:21:15,770
Do you have a name?

1218
01:21:17,370 --> 01:21:18,250
Oh my god, William!

1219
01:21:18,370 --> 01:21:20,030
There was a massacre.

1220
01:21:20,930 --> 01:21:23,510
Balls came walking in telling everyone to cover the front
entrance.

1221
01:21:25,390 --> 01:21:28,090
Said something about Joker's army coming through the main
gate.

1222
01:21:29,030 --> 01:21:31,810
Two of my guys moved to the exit and Frank shot him dead.

1223
01:21:32,510 --> 01:21:33,670
They never stood a chance.

1224
01:21:34,210 --> 01:21:35,250
Was Balls alone?

1225
01:21:35,770 --> 01:21:36,410
Thought he was.

1226
01:21:36,970 --> 01:21:38,410
Then I saw Harley Quinn.

1227
01:21:39,170 --> 01:21:41,270
She was surrounded by Black Gate prisoners.

1228
01:21:41,970 --> 01:21:43,310
They were just killing everyone.

1229
01:21:44,410 --> 01:21:45,670
I had no choice.

1230
01:21:45,830 --> 01:21:46,510
I got in here.

1231
01:21:46,630 --> 01:21:47,310
Lock the door.

1232
01:21:47,570 --> 01:21:48,330

1240
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:38,340
I don't think he would want you to take care of her.

1241
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:41,060

01:22:49,620 --> 01:22:50,060
Anything here?

1245
01:22:50,420 --> 01:22:50,720
No.

1246
01:22:52,720 --> 01:22:53,320

01:22:56,580 --> 01:22:57,860
No, John!

1250
01:22:58,300 --> 01:22:59,360
You're dead!

1251
01:23:01,180 --> 01:23:01,780
Anyway...

1252
01:23:01,780 --> 01:23:04,360
Now I feel like he wanted him to be dead.

1253
01:23:12,040 --> 01:23:13,480
What the fuck is Jack Rider?

1254
01:23:13,720 --> 01:23:14,840
I'm going to go in the Gotham Bay.

1255
01:23:33,780 --> 01:23:34,200
Scan.

1256
01:23:35,460 --> 01:23:36,440
No scan.

1257
01:23:37,660 --> 01:23:38,140
Scan.

1258
01:23:51,730 --> 01:23:52,570
Call his bluff.

1259
01:23:52,810 --> 01:23:54,450
He's not crazy enough to do it.

1260
01:23:55,750 --> 01:23:56,710
Call the

1261
01:24:00,280 --> 01:24:00,600
bluff.

1262
01:24:00,980 --> 01:24:02,680
No one lives in that mansion anyway.

1263
01:24:03,480 --> 01:24:04,220
Just Alfred.

1264
01:24:04,660 --> 01:24:05,620
It's just one guy.

1265
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:20,840
The audio keeps cutting in and out.

1266
01:24:20,980 --> 01:24:21,760
Wait, is that true?

1267
01:24:24,100 --> 01:24:25,700
Or is it just your YouTube?

1268
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:27,300
Is it just your YouTube?

1269
01:24:27,960 --> 01:24:29,660
All right, we need the critical combo.

1270
01:24:31,460 --> 01:24:32,020
No, not.

1271
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:32,380
Alfred.

1272
01:24:32,680 --> 01:24:37,160
Did you know in the comic series, he's been dead for five
years now?

1273
01:24:37,620 --> 01:24:38,020
Apparently.

1274
01:24:38,700 --> 01:24:39,840
Oh, it's just that guy.

1275
01:24:40,540 --> 01:24:41,880
Yeah, you got, I got one guy.

1276
01:24:42,200 --> 01:24:43,060
One guy.

1277
01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:44,700
I think you gotta check your PC.

1278
01:24:45,320 --> 01:24:47,000
Tell that one guy to check his PC.

1279
01:24:52,840 --> 01:24:53,540
One guy.

1280
01:24:54,340 --> 01:24:57,280
I think you gotta upgrade your PC, sir.

1281
01:24:59,140 --> 01:25:00,460
Oh, I can open doors.

1282
01:25:01,660 --> 01:25:02,120
Spoilers?

1283
01:25:02,300 --> 01:25:03,140
It's not a spoiler.

1284
01:25:03,180 --> 01:25:03,900
It's a, okay.

1285
01:25:04,140 --> 01:25:13,480

You, you are not gonna change.

1290
01:25:41,580 --> 01:25:44,400
You're the reason why the comic industry is dying.

1291
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:47,420
I'm the reason why the comic industry is dying.

1292
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:51,860
I literally, I literally just watched YouTube shorts to get
by comic lore.

1293
01:25:53,240 --> 01:25:59,180
Oh, people read the, read the, it's sad, but it's true.

No.

1304
01:27:35,900 --> 01:27:37,160
He doesn't matter, apparently.

1305
01:27:38,120 --> 01:27:39,280

01:27:39,500 --> 01:27:40,360

1313
01:27:50,080 --> 01:27:50,840
I saw the alert.

1314
01:27:51,020 --> 01:27:51,480

1316
01:27:52,580 --> 01:27:54,100
I'm outside the Arkham Mansion.

1317
01:27:54,940 --> 01:27:56,540
Harley Quinn probably triggered the alarm.

1318
01:27:57,180 --> 01:27:59,360
If she still got Gordon with her, he could get hurt.

1319
01:27:59,580 --> 01:28:00,180
Okay, done.

1328
01:28:43,560 --> 01:28:45,380
I didn't even have to read your riddle.

1329
01:28:45,580 --> 01:28:46,420
I have backseaters.

1330
01:28:46,900 --> 01:28:49,020
I can look up about myself.

1331
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:51,360
Okay.

1332
01:28:51,780 --> 01:28:52,560
Where's my bio?

1333
01:28:53,440 --> 01:28:55,420
Where is my billionaire bio?

1334
01:28:56,100 --> 01:28:56,720
Bruce Wayne.

1335
01:28:57,900 --> 01:28:59,800
Born into a wealthy Wayne family.

1336
01:28:59,960 --> 01:29:01,740
Bruce Wayne had an idyllic childhood.

1337
01:29:01,820 --> 01:29:06,480
Although he was giving me strong Have I... Has Bruce Wayne
ever graduated a university?

1338
01:29:07,020 --> 01:29:09,560
Does he even have a master's degree in business?

1339
01:29:11,360 --> 01:29:18,620
But his moral alistic and philophtrap parents, Thomas and
Martha.

1340
01:29:19,320 --> 01:29:26,600
After their violent murder at Crime Alley, Bruce dedicated
his life.

1341
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:30,640
He bought one to palling the cruel element that took their
lives.

1342
01:29:31,360 --> 01:29:32,980
Yeah, it hasn't really helped much.

1343
01:29:33,320 --> 01:29:38,480
left Gotham for many years to train his mental and physical
abilities across the globe.

1344
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:42,300
Before final returning, take up the mantle of the Dark
Knight.

1345
01:29:43,100 --> 01:29:45,060
It doesn't say he even has an education.

1346
01:29:47,900 --> 01:29:51,560
Why do you think he... Because he's running a fucking
billionaire company.

1347
01:29:52,500 --> 01:29:57,160
I feel like you should have some sense of business sense.

1348
01:29:57,640 --> 01:29:58,040
You know?

1349
01:29:59,420 --> 01:30:00,480
I don't know.

1350
01:30:00,620 --> 01:30:02,420
Am I crazy to think that?

1351
01:30:02,620 --> 01:30:03,160
I'm not...

1352
01:30:05,080 --> 01:30:18,260
is that too out of line to ask him to see if he has a
business a master's degree he signs paper they're here

1353
01:30:18,260 --> 01:30:28,580
expecting too much he just signs the papers they give him
the documents and then that is it yeah but don't you think

1354
01:30:28,580 --> 01:30:47,940

gonna sign it he has to read it too right like right he has

The dead guy has a name!

1359
01:31:16,580 --> 01:31:18,160
That's so fucked up.

1360
01:31:20,460 --> 01:31:20,880

Oh shit!

1363
01:31:25,740 --> 01:31:26,840
Where's the gun?

1364
01:31:28,660 --> 01:31:32,240
Sorry, I didn't have my fucking detective mode on

01:32:05,480 --> 01:32:07,580
Jackson has been a pen.

1369
01:32:14,980 --> 01:32:16,040
Bro, my car is...

1370
01:32:16,040 --> 01:32:16,900
I have no insurance.

1371
01:32:19,380 --> 01:32:21,220
There's a lot of cutbacks here.

1372
01:32:21,680 --> 01:32:23,080
Why don't I get my car to work?

1373
01:32:24,140 --> 01:32:24,480
Hello.

1374
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:27,060
Oh, they don't have guns.

1375
01:32:27,200 --> 01:32:28,220
Wait, they don't have guns.

1376
01:32:28,920 --> 01:32:29,420
This is good.

1377
01:32:31,040 --> 01:32:33,240
I guess I'll just beat them up.

1378
01:32:34,100 --> 01:32:34,780
It's okay, guys.

1379
01:32:35,340 --> 01:32:35,940
No gun!

1380
01:32:37,660 --> 01:32:38,480
Oh, shit.

1381
01:32:40,120 --> 01:32:41,520
Give me a sec.

1382
01:32:46,160 --> 01:32:46,660

01:32:47,620 --> 01:32:48,200
Oh, fuck.

01:32:49,200 --> 01:32:49,960
Oh, I'm disoriented.

1385
01:32:50,100 --> 01:32:51,160
I'm disoriented right now.

1386
01:32:51,760 --> 01:32:52,080
It's fine.

1387
01:32:52,180 --> 01:32:52,440
It's fine.

1388
01:32:52,600 --> 01:32:52,900
It's fine.

1389
01:32:54,060 --> 01:32:55,060
Just take his pipe.

1390
01:32:56,840 --> 01:32:57,180
Oh, shit.

1391
01:32:57,260 --> 01:32:57,560
Nice.

1392
01:32:59,120 --> 01:32:59,800
All right.

1393
01:32:59,980 --> 01:33:00,920
Punch him in the dick.

1394
01:33:01,620 --> 01:33:01,980
All right.

1395
01:33:02,240 --> 01:33:03,180
Punch him in the head.

1396
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:05,500
Easy.

1397
01:33:11,280 --> 01:33:11,780
Nice.

1398
01:33:12,200 --> 01:33:13,080
That was easy.

1399
01:33:13,400 --> 01:33:15,360
There's a supply of explosive gel.

1400
01:33:15,900 --> 01:33:16,480
Oh my god.

1401
01:33:18,920 --> 01:33:19,320
Well.

1402
01:33:22,480 --> 01:33:23,840
Rest in peace, my car.

1403
01:33:25,040 --> 01:33:26,540
Collect explosive gel.

1404
01:33:31,380 --> 01:33:32,860
Can we use this destroy structure?

1405
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:34,180
Oh, shit, nice.

1406
01:33:34,780 --> 01:33:36,840
I can finally destroy walls now.

1407
01:33:37,880 --> 01:33:39,060
Explosives may harm.

1408
01:33:39,380 --> 01:33:39,680
May.

1409
01:33:40,340 --> 01:33:43,140
Okay, but like, we don't care about that, right?

insurance no there could be a clue as to where she took

1411
01:33:55,100 --> 01:34:00,820

fuck would you insure a batmobile because like what's the

1412
01:34:00,820 --> 01:34:06,340
point because then what's the point of having a secret
identity we try insuring a batmobile

1413
01:34:10,980 --> 01:34:13,900

1414
01:34:19,360 --> 01:34:20,240

01:34:23,400 --> 01:34:25,980
Wait, does do I even have a license plate?

1416
01:34:29,500 --> 01:34:31,240
My god, I don't even have it licensed.

1417
01:34:34,710 --> 01:34:36,710
Okay, this evidence scanner.

1418
01:34:36,970 --> 01:34:37,950
All right, backseaters.

01:34:41,910 --> 01:34:43,550
Okay, but where the...

1421
01:34:43,550 --> 01:34:46,770
Where am I supposed to scan?

1422
01:34:53,260 --> 01:34:54,720
Do I own an insurance company?

1423
01:34:57,220 --> 01:35:10,440

1426
01:35:30,900 --> 01:35:33,160
need to detect anything when I have these fists.

1427
01:35:33,840 --> 01:35:35,140
How do I destroy this?

1428
01:35:42,600 --> 01:35:43,860
What's that rule, Joker?

1429
01:35:50,860 --> 01:35:52,320
It's a secret.

1430
01:35:55,880 --> 01:35:58,320
Did I not have the explosive gel already?

1431
01:35:59,180 --> 01:35:59,720

1432
01:36:00,100 --> 01:36:00,420

Oh, okay.

1434
01:36:01,960 --> 01:36:02,860

1435
01:36:03,200 --> 01:36:03,500
Boop.

Okay, LT to prepare explosive gel.

They're not prepared it.

1440
01:36:16,460 --> 01:36:17,680
They're not prepared enough.

1441
01:36:22,140 --> 01:36:22,540
Oh!

1442
01:36:23,140 --> 01:36:23,500

Oh, they are definitely not good guys.

01:41:41,540 --> 01:41:42,300
Don't worry.

1475
01:41:42,500 --> 01:41:45,860
They won't be able to see me when I walk very slow up to
them, right?

1476
01:41:48,100 --> 01:41:48,600
Hello.

1477
01:41:54,170 --> 01:41:55,710
Yeah, he's too busy working.

1478
01:41:58,610 --> 01:41:59,510
He won't know.

1479
01:41:59,530 --> 01:42:00,230
No either.

1480
01:42:00,710 --> 01:42:01,710
Wait, what are they building?

1481
01:42:02,590 --> 01:42:03,430
What is this?

1482
01:42:04,290 --> 01:42:08,010
Are they trying to improve the structural integrity of this
building?

1483
01:42:08,530 --> 01:42:10,080
And why am I silencing them?

1484
01:42:11,410 --> 01:42:11,890
Did it?

1485
01:42:12,350 --> 01:42:12,350
Why?

1486
01:42:14,950 --> 01:42:17,990
They just carpenters, Doki.

1487
01:42:18,550 --> 01:42:19,850
What the fuck is wrong?

1488
01:42:20,270 --> 01:42:20,890
What are you?

1489
01:42:24,710 --> 01:42:28,010
They're just trying to fix the structure.

1490
01:42:30,790 --> 01:42:32,410
I can't believe it.

1491
01:42:32,490 --> 01:42:34,010
We gotta cancel, Batman.

1492
01:42:36,250 --> 01:42:37,230
Is he okay?

1493
01:42:38,190 --> 01:42:38,710
Are you okay?

1494
01:42:39,370 --> 01:42:40,610
Batman, what's going on?

1495
01:42:41,130 --> 01:42:42,770
The crazies are moving towards the medical facility.

1496
01:42:42,910 --> 01:42:44,530
Yeah, but I want to talk to this one guy.

1497
01:42:45,130 --> 01:42:47,490
He's trying to take over the island piece by piece.

1498
01:42:48,230 --> 01:42:49,890
It looks like medical is his next target.

1499
01:42:50,530 --> 01:42:51,950
Has anyone got out of the building?

1500
01:42:52,570 --> 01:42:53,470
I saw a doctor try.

1501
01:42:53,470 --> 01:42:54,290
Can't believe it.

1502
01:42:54,430 --> 01:42:57,210
Batman's against fucking handyman.

1503
01:42:58,270 --> 01:42:59,010
He's a chance.

1504
01:42:59,530 --> 01:43:00,870
Against trade schools.

1505
01:43:02,270 --> 01:43:04,490
I want to talk to this one guy.

1506
01:43:05,750 --> 01:43:06,770
I want to see he has a name.

1507
01:43:08,990 --> 01:43:09,350
Alright.

1508
01:43:09,950 --> 01:43:10,870
I'll go inside.

1509
01:43:12,190 --> 01:43:12,970
What?

1510
01:43:19,340 --> 01:43:19,580
Me?

1511
01:43:20,080 --> 01:43:20,740
No.

1512
01:43:21,300 --> 01:43:22,180
Wait, go inside.

1513
01:43:22,340 --> 01:43:22,860
What's inside?

1514
01:43:26,140 --> 01:43:26,920
Hello?

1515
01:43:28,260 --> 01:43:29,040
Hello?

1516
01:43:36,610 --> 01:43:37,390
Whoa.

1517
01:43:37,590 --> 01:43:37,710
Whoa.

1518
01:43:39,470 --> 01:43:40,810
Take off your mask.

1519
01:43:41,970 --> 01:43:43,830
So, Bats, I was thinking.

1520
01:43:44,330 --> 01:43:46,730
You really could use a friend in here.

1521
01:43:47,690 --> 01:43:49,170
Someone to talk to.

1522
01:43:49,870 --> 01:43:51,110
There's any friends.

1523
01:43:51,210 --> 01:43:52,810
That's why he adopts kids.

1524
01:43:53,190 --> 01:43:55,070
To fill that hole in his heart.

1525
01:43:55,570 --> 01:43:57,510
Who is that behind the mask?

1526
01:43:58,090 --> 01:44:02,310
Why do you feel the need to go out into the world and fight
people like me?

1527
01:44:02,750 --> 01:44:05,310
Do you really think you could win?

1528
01:44:06,150 --> 01:44:07,210
We'll see.

1529
01:44:13,200 --> 01:44:15,320
Wait, this is first-person now.

1530
01:44:15,540 --> 01:44:16,280
That's interesting.

1531
01:44:18,820 --> 01:44:20,060
Where do I go, though?

1532
01:44:23,970 --> 01:44:24,350
Huh?

1533
01:44:32,600 --> 01:44:34,200
Can't do anything here.

1534
01:44:39,520 --> 01:44:41,180
Oh, is it only this building?

1535
01:44:43,600 --> 01:44:44,200
Is that it?

1536
01:44:44,640 --> 01:44:45,320
Do I leave?

1537
01:44:46,200 --> 01:44:46,800
Okay.

1538
01:44:48,280 --> 01:44:48,980
Joker?

1539
01:44:52,810 --> 01:44:53,160
Joker?

1540
01:44:54,160 --> 01:44:55,500
Oh, you come back later.

1541
01:44:55,660 --> 01:44:57,500
Oh, it's an Easter egg.

1542
01:45:00,300 --> 01:45:01,960
It's just to talk to Joker.

1543
01:45:04,600 --> 01:45:05,840
I was gonna say.

1544
01:45:07,020 --> 01:45:10,140
I was gonna say, like, what do I do next?

1545
01:45:10,380 --> 01:45:11,180
That's interesting.

1546
01:45:11,960 --> 01:45:14,040
That's, that's, like, first person.

1547
01:45:16,040 --> 01:45:17,620
Go back inside later.

1548
01:45:18,720 --> 01:45:20,900
Is it trying to turn into, like, some fucking horror film?

1549
01:45:21,760 --> 01:45:22,840
Alright, where's the tobacco?

1550
01:45:23,080 --> 01:45:23,740
Oh, there it is.

1551
01:45:24,460 --> 01:45:26,680
There's six hostiles, six unarmed.

1552
01:45:26,740 --> 01:45:27,220
Oh, they're unarmed!

1553
01:45:27,320 --> 01:45:27,940
They don't have guns!

1554
01:45:28,360 --> 01:45:29,560
It's time to beat them up.

1555
01:45:30,700 --> 01:45:31,540
They don't have guns.

1556
01:45:31,660 --> 01:45:32,280
This is perfect.

1557
01:45:33,300 --> 01:45:34,400
Wait, what's over there?

1558
01:45:34,580 --> 01:45:35,100
Oh, shit.

1559
01:45:35,300 --> 01:45:36,280
That's a lot of dead people.

1560
01:45:39,140 --> 01:45:42,740
Joki, you already said that again.

1561
01:45:42,860 --> 01:45:44,440
It wasn't funny the first time.

1562
01:45:45,460 --> 01:45:46,540
It wasn't cool.

1563
01:45:48,260 --> 01:45:48,660
Wait.

1564
01:45:49,020 --> 01:45:49,340
You know what?

1565
01:45:49,340 --> 01:45:50,580
I'm just gonna beat them up for XP.

1566
01:45:51,880 --> 01:45:52,560
Oh, shit.

1567
01:45:52,960 --> 01:45:53,560
It's fine.

1568
01:45:54,160 --> 01:45:54,580
guns.

1569
01:45:55,360 --> 01:45:55,920
I ain't scared.

1570
01:45:56,880 --> 01:45:57,720
You don't have guns.

1571
01:45:58,020 --> 01:45:58,800
Oh, shit, you have teeth.

1572
01:45:59,920 --> 01:46:00,660
Give me a sec.

1573
01:46:02,960 --> 01:46:03,520
Nice.

1574
01:46:04,420 --> 01:46:05,920
I love body mashing.

1575
01:46:06,880 --> 01:46:07,340
Alright, no!

1576
01:46:07,440 --> 01:46:07,940
Fuck, okay.

1577
01:46:08,520 --> 01:46:09,380
Oh, shit.

1578
01:46:09,740 --> 01:46:09,820
No!

1579
01:46:12,020 --> 01:46:13,060
Alright, we're fine.

1580
01:46:13,900 --> 01:46:14,440
Dick punch.

1581
01:46:17,680 --> 01:46:18,240
Alright.

1582
01:46:19,260 --> 01:46:20,200
Brain damage.

1583
01:46:21,860 --> 01:46:22,640
It's fine.

1584
01:46:24,160 --> 01:46:25,880
I might get a little bit of brain damage, too.

1585
01:46:26,780 --> 01:46:29,200
But I'm a streamer, so it's, like, part of the job.

1586
01:46:29,320 --> 01:46:29,580
Okay.

1587
01:46:34,580 --> 01:46:35,300
Alright, nice.

1588
01:46:39,960 --> 01:46:40,860
Wait, where's the other one?

1589
01:46:41,620 --> 01:46:42,420
Where's the other teeth?

1590
01:46:43,840 --> 01:46:45,340
Oh my gosh, so hard to see the teeth.

1591
01:46:46,640 --> 01:46:48,380
You can't see thank you for the Akasupa.

1592
01:46:48,620 --> 01:46:49,020
Thank you!

1593
01:46:49,020 --> 01:46:49,780
Thank you!

1594
01:46:50,060 --> 01:46:50,420
Potato.

1595
01:46:51,380 --> 01:46:51,980
That's me.

1596
01:46:54,160 --> 01:47:05,900
god like honestly i feel like i should have like a a life to
life a life to life exchange if they get to kill two people

1597
01:47:05,900 --> 01:47:16,340
i get to kill two people because like i'm pretty sure this
is like 10 families already just in this geno vicinity i

1598
01:47:16,340 --> 01:47:20,480
like i have to like pay for 10 extra families

1599
01:47:24,160 --> 01:47:25,320
Open door.

1600
01:47:29,970 --> 01:47:31,010
Harley!

1601
01:47:32,790 --> 01:47:33,410
Hey there.

1602
01:47:33,990 --> 01:47:34,570
Hey there, girl.

1603
01:47:38,990 --> 01:47:39,930
Where's Gordon?

1604
01:47:40,850 --> 01:47:41,570
Wouldn't you like to go?

1605
01:47:42,690 --> 01:47:43,010
Oh.

1606
01:47:44,150 --> 01:47:45,910
Wait, where is he?

1607
01:47:48,450 --> 01:47:48,970
Pudding!

1608
01:47:53,420 --> 01:47:55,840
I can fix her.

1609
01:48:02,050 --> 01:48:03,450
Oh, they're definitely...

1610
01:48:03,470 --> 01:48:05,970
They definitely like to have a warrior, too.

1611
01:48:06,790 --> 01:48:07,830
Oh, yeah, they're freaky.

1612
01:48:09,870 --> 01:48:10,850
They're definitely freaky.

1613
01:48:13,510 --> 01:48:15,250
Yeah, it's Tara Strong.

1614
01:48:17,210 --> 01:48:18,970
Before she got super weird.

1615
01:48:26,330 --> 01:48:26,930
Okay.

1616
01:48:27,610 --> 01:48:31,990
The one of the weirdest shit about her is that, like...

1617
01:48:31,990 --> 01:48:33,450
Okay, this is what's my gripe.

1618
01:48:33,470 --> 01:48:42,830
about Tara strong oh it's not it's not her oh shit it's not
okay but anyway there is like there's the one of the weird

1619
01:48:42,830 --> 01:48:53,090
shit about what her is that she was like no AI voices so
because it hurts the voice acting industry and then later on

1620
01:48:53,090 --> 01:49:06,330
she was like but AI art is okay I thought I thought that was
like pretty weird not I can't pick and choose that.

1621
01:49:09,770 --> 01:49:12,930
I just thought that was fucking weird.

1622
01:49:18,130 --> 01:49:19,190
I don't know about you.

1623
01:49:21,360 --> 01:49:27,820
I feel like if you have any stats regarding a certain thing,
I feel like you shouldn't pick and choose.

1624
01:49:32,020 --> 01:49:32,980
That's Arlene.

1625
01:49:33,520 --> 01:49:36,660
I thought that was Tyra's job because like, usually they get
Tyra's job.

1626
01:49:36,680 --> 01:49:39,480
for Harley Quinn.

1627
01:49:48,220 --> 01:49:48,960
Alright, let's see.

1628
01:49:53,100 --> 01:49:55,780
Search for a structural weakness in the exterior.

1629
01:49:57,240 --> 01:50:01,040
At this point, everything should be a structural weakness in
this fucking city.

1630
01:50:02,660 --> 01:50:04,080
Alright, let's see.

1631
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:08,800
But now 14 years ago.

1632
01:50:09,080 --> 01:50:13,640
Wasn't Tyra Strong like the original voice actor actress for
Harley Quinn?

1633
01:50:14,700 --> 01:50:22,360
I thought she was when the original animated series or was
it or was it Arlene oh Arlene was the original?

1634
01:50:22,900 --> 01:50:29,620
Oh okay I didn't know that.

1635
01:50:32,990 --> 01:50:33,850
That's Arlene.

1636
01:50:34,110 --> 01:50:35,890
Why is Arlene not as popular?

1637
01:50:39,770 --> 01:50:41,290
Okay Batman.

1638
01:50:43,130 --> 01:50:44,130
Alright dead neat.

1639
01:50:44,710 --> 01:50:45,110
Nice.

1640
01:50:50,220 --> 01:50:56,340
Oh, she's She passed away Okay, that makes a lot more sense
I didn't know that

1641
01:51:03,500 --> 01:51:12,520
I think I like how Like Mark Hamill like retired Joker When
Kevin Conroy Passed away Because like that's very respectful

1642
01:51:12,520 --> 01:51:17,920
Can I break this

1643
01:51:28,400 --> 01:51:35,440
That's fucked up Being a doctor is very hard Joker He spent
like at least 10 years to get that degree, man.

1644
01:51:36,100 --> 01:51:37,940
We don't have enough people, Joker.

1645
01:51:39,680 --> 01:51:45,540
If we don't have doctors in Gotham City, then, like, who the
fuck is gonna patch you up?

1646
01:51:45,620 --> 01:51:47,640
There's not enough veterinarians for that.

1647
01:51:52,260 --> 01:51:52,700
Yeah.

1648
01:51:53,060 --> 01:51:54,080
Oh, this way.

1649
01:51:55,380 --> 01:51:55,740
Wait.

1650
01:51:56,140 --> 01:51:58,000
How am I supposed to get the fucking trophy?

1651
01:52:00,820 --> 01:52:01,960
Where am I going?

1652
01:52:02,440 --> 01:52:03,820
He said...

1653
01:52:03,820 --> 01:52:05,800
He said death, Joker.

1654
01:52:07,080 --> 01:52:07,920
Oh, nice.

1655
01:52:08,300 --> 01:52:08,740
Trophy time.

1656
01:52:12,680 --> 01:52:12,980
Veteranarians?

1657
01:52:13,120 --> 01:52:14,000
Yeah, you don't know that?

1658
01:52:14,240 --> 01:52:15,420
I learned this from a movie.

1659
01:52:16,060 --> 01:52:23,180
But, like, sometimes the mob used the veterinarians to patch
them up illegally, so they don't have to go through a real

1660
01:52:23,180 --> 01:52:23,760
doctor.

1661
01:52:24,520 --> 01:52:26,220
Obviously, movies are true.

1662
01:52:32,660 --> 01:52:36,420
Obviously, what you see in the movies is what's actually
going on.

1663
01:52:36,440 --> 01:52:37,500
Who's that guy?

1664
01:52:38,600 --> 01:52:39,180
Is that a doctor?

1665
01:52:40,460 --> 01:52:41,920
Why does he need the doctor?

1666
01:52:42,620 --> 01:52:44,220
I've got to save them.

1667
01:52:45,440 --> 01:52:45,980
We do.

1668
01:52:46,740 --> 01:52:46,940
True.

1669
01:52:52,540 --> 01:52:56,540
Oh, inverted takedown.

1670
01:52:57,780 --> 01:52:58,480
Whoa, shit!

1671
01:53:00,080 --> 01:53:00,520
You don't see it!

1672
01:53:00,580 --> 01:53:00,940
They don't see it!

1673
01:53:01,040 --> 01:53:01,400
They don't see!

1674
01:53:02,280 --> 01:53:02,760
Whoa!

1675
01:53:04,040 --> 01:53:05,360
Don't worry, I'm too fast.

1676
01:53:06,440 --> 01:53:07,000
Too fast.

1677
01:53:09,500 --> 01:53:10,140
Oh, wait.

1678
01:53:10,200 --> 01:53:11,980
And we should not have done that, actually.

1679
01:53:15,100 --> 01:53:16,060
Oh, hey.

1680
01:53:17,360 --> 01:53:17,980
He doesn't know.

1681
01:53:18,060 --> 01:53:19,400
Oh, that's a lot of people.

1682
01:53:19,880 --> 01:53:20,780
Oh, okay.

1683
01:53:20,880 --> 01:53:21,980
That is a lot of people.

1684
01:53:22,900 --> 01:53:24,500
Can I do more than one person?

1685
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:27,520
Wait, where's the doctor?

1686
01:53:28,200 --> 01:53:30,020
What if I actually kill the doctor?

1687
01:53:31,920 --> 01:53:32,600
Can I?

1688
01:53:34,100 --> 01:53:35,920
Okay, this is science reasons.

1689
01:53:37,400 --> 01:53:37,880
Okay.

1690
01:53:37,900 --> 01:53:38,980
Okay, no, she's safe.

1691
01:53:40,760 --> 01:53:42,120
I just wanted to know.

1692
01:53:42,400 --> 01:53:44,260
Because what if I accidentally kill her?

1693
01:53:44,900 --> 01:53:45,380
You know?

1694
01:53:47,680 --> 01:53:51,020
I'm just trying to make sure I don't accidentally kill
anybody.

1695
01:53:52,880 --> 01:53:56,080
Alright, I'm totally gonna get shot at when I do this.

1696
01:53:57,340 --> 01:53:58,320
Stealth mission.

1697
01:53:58,720 --> 01:54:00,720
I'm in pretty stealthy like this, right?

1698
01:54:01,280 --> 01:54:02,000
Come on.

1699
01:54:02,240 --> 01:54:03,500
Get over here.

1700
01:54:05,580 --> 01:54:06,140
Wait.

1701
01:54:06,300 --> 01:54:06,920
Oh, there you go.

1702
01:54:07,460 --> 01:54:07,880
Yay.

1703
01:54:10,020 --> 01:54:12,180
Don't worry, I'll just fly.

1704
01:54:12,820 --> 01:54:13,540
Just keep flying.

1705
01:54:14,620 --> 01:54:15,240
He doesn't know.

1706
01:54:17,720 --> 01:54:17,980
Okay.

1707
01:54:21,640 --> 01:54:22,680
Yeah, after.

1708
01:54:23,720 --> 01:54:25,020
It's all about after.

1709
01:54:26,860 --> 01:54:27,900
Okay, maybe I...

1710
01:54:30,500 --> 01:54:32,280
Can I make them go over there?

1711
01:54:33,680 --> 01:54:35,520
Can I make them walk over there?

1712
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:37,260
Oh, I can!

1713
01:54:38,620 --> 01:54:39,740
He's not going to look up.

1714
01:54:40,020 --> 01:54:40,300
Trust me.

1715
01:54:41,840 --> 01:54:42,880
Come on.

1716
01:54:42,960 --> 01:54:43,960
Head down here.

1717
01:54:44,020 --> 01:54:44,980
You know you want to.

1718
01:54:46,060 --> 01:54:46,580
Come on.

1719
01:54:47,080 --> 01:54:47,880
Come on.

1720
01:54:48,600 --> 01:54:49,260
Oh, yeah.

1721
01:54:49,540 --> 01:54:50,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1722
01:54:50,800 --> 01:54:51,500
Come on.

1723
01:54:52,600 --> 01:54:53,220
Come on.

1724
01:54:53,260 --> 01:54:54,420
It's just two more steps.

1725
01:54:56,840 --> 01:54:57,160
Wait.

1726
01:54:57,600 --> 01:54:58,200
Wait a minute.

1727
01:55:01,340 --> 01:55:02,540
Wait a minute.

1728
01:55:03,100 --> 01:55:03,620
Oh, okay.

1729
01:55:03,700 --> 01:55:04,380
I can do it here.

1730
01:55:04,680 --> 01:55:07,240
I was going to be like, that's fucked up.

1731
01:55:07,980 --> 01:55:09,640
I got lied to.

1732
01:55:11,560 --> 01:55:11,780
Okay.

1733
01:55:12,360 --> 01:55:13,540
I might hit it here.

1734
01:55:13,980 --> 01:55:14,820
Yeah, come over here.

1735
01:55:15,500 --> 01:55:16,600
You know you want to.

1736
01:55:17,860 --> 01:55:20,120
You know you want to walk over there.

1737
01:55:21,640 --> 01:55:22,700
Come on.

1738
01:55:28,340 --> 01:55:29,320
Come on.

1739
01:55:29,980 --> 01:55:30,560
Oh, fuck it.

1740
01:55:30,620 --> 01:55:30,900
I can't.

1741
01:55:30,900 --> 01:55:32,360
I'm not patient enough for this.

1742
01:55:33,020 --> 01:55:33,420
Fuck this.

1743
01:55:34,660 --> 01:55:36,880
His teammate's not going to be helping him anyway.

1744
01:55:39,100 --> 01:55:39,680
Oh, shit!

1745
01:55:40,260 --> 01:55:41,540
Oh, shit!

1746
01:55:41,860 --> 01:55:42,820
Okay.

1747
01:55:44,460 --> 01:55:45,840
Now he's not gonna...

1748
01:55:45,840 --> 01:55:46,660
Wait, is it?

1749
01:55:47,060 --> 01:55:47,840
Is he gonna shoot me?

1750
01:55:48,320 --> 01:55:49,640
No, he can't tell.

1751
01:55:50,440 --> 01:55:51,160
Is that the last guy?

1752
01:55:51,400 --> 01:55:51,620
Alright.

1753
01:55:52,120 --> 01:55:52,450
Wee!

1754
01:55:55,540 --> 01:55:57,520
Get over here.

1755
01:56:01,070 --> 01:56:01,730
Nice.

1756
01:56:04,060 --> 01:56:05,330
I did it.

1757
01:56:09,050 --> 01:56:09,710
Doctors!

1758
01:56:10,410 --> 01:56:11,650
What is going on?

1759
01:56:12,170 --> 01:56:13,610
I did it, doctors!

1760
01:56:15,270 --> 01:56:27,030

harley quinn did they have anyone with them they took

1761
01:56:27,030 --> 01:56:33,150
someone into the elevator i couldn't tell who it was they
obviously didn't want to be followed the elevator appears to

1762
01:56:33,150 --> 01:56:40,350
have been powered down you're going to be okay here we'll be
fine what about the others we heard gunfire they could be

1763
01:56:40,350 --> 01:56:45,970
dead we should go and help oh no i forgot Harley's blonde?

1764
01:56:46,690 --> 01:56:48,510
Okay, I'm thinking about red hair, Harley.

1765
01:56:50,270 --> 01:56:55,170
Oh, no, I'm thinking about poison ivy hair.

1766
01:56:56,030 --> 01:56:56,810
Okay, sorry.

1767
01:56:57,070 --> 01:57:02,350
I was watching Harley Quinn earlier and, like, my hair
colors got mixed up.

1768
01:57:02,370 --> 01:57:07,370
I was thinking about poison ivy.

1769
01:57:09,850 --> 01:57:15,010
I'm gonna say newest season of Harley Quinn Pretty fucking
shit.

1770
01:57:17,990 --> 01:57:21,630
The writing for that was got fucking weird.

1771
01:57:27,420 --> 01:57:29,140
Oh, interview tape.

1772
01:57:31,340 --> 01:57:31,800
Fake fat.

1773
01:57:32,120 --> 01:57:38,660
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. I didn't know Alfred died five years ago
and was never brought back.

1774
01:57:41,500 --> 01:57:44,940
Patience name is Edward Nichol, also known as the Riddler.

1775
01:57:45,940 --> 01:57:56,160
So Edward in threatening riddles scrawled on the asylum
walls one would have to be severely paranoid to read threats

1776
01:58:02,220 --> 01:58:07,640
What is it that walks on four legs then two legs and finally
three legs?

1777
01:58:08,800 --> 01:58:10,220
A human being old man.

1778
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:11,280
Yeah.

1779
01:58:11,760 --> 01:58:12,140
Oh, sorry.

1780
01:58:12,340 --> 01:58:12,920
Yeah, human.

1781
01:58:13,160 --> 01:58:20,660
Yeah Oh, yeah, I'm so fucking smart Good try but the answer
to all three is a baby

1782
01:58:23,860 --> 01:58:26,040
What the fuck

1783
01:58:30,550 --> 01:58:44,770

I'm so close to leveling up dad I I mean, if you think about

1785
01:59:01,070 --> 01:59:03,070
it, it works with old elderly, too.

1786
01:59:07,040 --> 01:59:07,980
Oh, there's...

1787
01:59:07,980 --> 01:59:08,520
Oh, I can't...

1788
01:59:08,520 --> 01:59:09,840
I don't have to upgrade yet, right?

1789
01:59:10,720 --> 01:59:12,380
Oh, no, that's just a gargoyle.

1790
01:59:23,770 --> 01:59:25,250
It's the simple things.

1791
01:59:26,210 --> 01:59:26,770
Oh, shit.

1792
01:59:26,850 --> 01:59:27,790
Look at his packs, though.

1793
01:59:28,330 --> 01:59:29,410
From that angle.

1794
01:59:31,050 --> 01:59:31,370
Alright.

1795
01:59:32,770 --> 01:59:34,030
Where am I supposed to go?

1796
01:59:34,450 --> 01:59:36,070
Locate and rescue Dr. Young.

1797
01:59:36,210 --> 01:59:38,350
Locate and rescue Dr. Kellerman.

1798
01:59:38,530 --> 01:59:39,310
Locate and rescue...

1799
01:59:39,330 --> 01:59:40,070
Dr. Chen.

1800
01:59:40,190 --> 01:59:40,710
Oh, it's Chen.

1801
01:59:40,830 --> 01:59:41,450
It's all the doctors.

1802
01:59:42,030 --> 01:59:42,470
Alright.

1803
01:59:42,970 --> 01:59:44,210
Does it really matter, though?

1804
01:59:45,130 --> 01:59:47,430
Do we really need to rescue all these doctors?

1805
01:59:49,090 --> 01:59:49,910
2 is enough.

1806
01:59:53,670 --> 01:59:55,410
Wouldn't 2 be enough, guys?

1807
01:59:57,830 --> 01:59:59,670
I'm so confused where to go.

1808
02:00:02,290 --> 02:00:06,910
Yeah, I don't like... The only thing I don't like is when
you go from detective mode... Oh, shit.

1809
02:00:07,090 --> 02:00:07,310
Nice.

1810
02:00:09,190 --> 02:00:20,230
When you go from detective mode, to like uh to like normal

02:00:59,990 --> 02:01:08,630

risk everything.

1815
02:01:12,860 --> 02:01:14,360
Where the fuck is the elevator?

1816
02:01:15,560 --> 02:01:15,760
Okay.

1817
02:01:16,780 --> 02:01:18,660
Wait, how do I open that door?

1818
02:01:19,040 --> 02:01:20,040
Can I open doors?

1819
02:01:20,640 --> 02:01:21,860
Oh, I just pressed...

1820
02:01:22,520 --> 02:01:24,600
How did I open...

1821
02:01:24,600 --> 02:01:26,360
God, I'm so...

1822
02:01:27,700 --> 02:01:30,440
How do I open this door?

1823
02:01:31,400 --> 02:01:31,920
Alright.

1824
02:01:32,420 --> 02:01:34,320
Wait, how do we save this game?

1825
02:01:34,860 --> 02:01:35,900
Where's the checkpoint?

1826
02:01:36,420 --> 02:01:38,460
Oh my god, where's the checkpoint in this game?

1827
02:01:39,280 --> 02:01:42,600
work of our new head of research, Dr. Panamika.

1828
02:01:43,400 --> 02:01:51,160
Since joining our team two years ago, Arkham is now at the
forefront of research into understanding the human mind.

1829
02:01:52,060 --> 02:01:53,060
Good afternoon, Arkham.

1830
02:01:53,400 --> 02:01:54,820
Let's talk about the mind.

1831
02:01:55,340 --> 02:01:59,580
How can such a complex entity be understood and eventually
treated when it breaks?

1832
02:02:00,020 --> 02:02:00,740
How, indeed?

1833
02:02:01,880 --> 02:02:09,260
Project Titan's goal is to create a test bed to fully probe
our special cases in a safe, risk-free manner.

1834
02:02:10,720 --> 02:02:17,640
Our goal is to cure the more unfortunate specimens, the
weak, those not physically up to the challenge that our

1835
02:02:17,640 --> 02:02:19,040
medical practices present.

1836
02:02:20,360 --> 02:02:25,020
Project Titan will make us a world-class facility, an
award-winning facility.

1837
02:02:25,840 --> 02:02:31,620
When you or someone you know is seriously distressed, there
are few institutions where they can be taken and where you

1838
02:02:31,620 --> 02:02:35,520
can be reassured that they are safe and undergoing the
finest care available.

1839
02:02:39,280 --> 02:02:41,320
packages can be found at the front desk.

1840
02:02:41,500 --> 02:02:42,420
Is that a real site?

1841
02:02:43,040 --> 02:02:45,200
I had to be like 14 years ago.

1842
02:02:45,300 --> 02:02:46,300
Slash prices.

1843
02:02:46,800 --> 02:02:49,580
We accept most major HMOs.

1844
02:02:50,080 --> 02:02:53,700
Let me introduce you all to the sterling work of our new
head of research.

1845
02:02:53,900 --> 02:02:55,160
Wait, let me open this door.

1846
02:02:55,460 --> 02:02:57,080
Is there no, I'll say when I open this door?

1847
02:02:57,260 --> 02:02:58,000
Let's try.

1848
02:02:58,360 --> 02:03:00,240
Does it tell me an icon?

1849
02:03:01,060 --> 02:03:01,620
Is that an icon?

1850
02:03:01,800 --> 02:03:02,720
How do I know?

1851
02:03:05,360 --> 02:03:06,140
How do I...

1852
02:03:06,140 --> 02:03:08,380
How do I know if that auto's saved?

1853
02:03:09,280 --> 02:03:10,000
