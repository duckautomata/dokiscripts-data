1
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:46,680
Hello!

2
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:47,700
Oh, where am I?

3
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,100
Oh, hey!

4
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,280
Magic trick.

5
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:51,160
Abracadabra.

6
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,020
Hello everybody!

7
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:57,280
Hello, hello.

8
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:58,440
Welcome.

9
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,000
I wasn't supposed to stream today.

10
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:08,460
I was gonna take today off because I was gonna be like, you know, I'll only stream during the round robins because like, I don't want people to know.

11
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:22,360
I mean like, they can see my progress on other people's streams, but like, I didn't want to make it easy for people to see where I'm at skill level wise.

12
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:26,980
I didn't want to make it easy for people to know how bad I am.

13
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:34,040
They have to actively find me on other people's streams.

14
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:45,420
Anyway, um, I decided to, um, I decided to stream today because today we have a very special coach today.

15
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:48,440
Uh, we have, yes, Jaewon.

16
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:58,540
He is famous and infamous for many moments and, uh, classic moments in the FGC community.

17
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,400
Yes, let's go Justin!

18
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,540
Let's go Justin!

19
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,340
I swear to God.

20
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,440
If I hear any of you guys go, let's go Tokie.

21
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,480
I swear to fucking God, you don't want me to win.

22
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:17,660
Anyway.

23
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,200
Um, I, okay.

24
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,920
I legitimately did not know that was him.

25
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,380
Like, that was him and in EVO Moment 37.

26
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:34,380
I, I actually didn't realize that was him in EVO Moment 37 until people kept like linking it, I was like that's him?

27
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,860
Oh my God.

28
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:39,260
That's him?

29
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:39,540
That's him?

30
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:40,380
I was like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

31
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:51,180
I thought, the one I, the clip I do know where Justin came from was the, cause that, that clip I know very well, um, the, the Mortal Kombat clip.

32
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,360
That was actually, like, my very first introduction to, to, to Jaewon.

33
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,100
And that was, that was the, the clip I actually knew where he's from.

34
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,620
And, uh, you're gonna learn today.

35
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:04,920
Like, I quote that sometimes.

36
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:11,160
So, like, when I found out, I was like, wait, Jaewon is, is you gonna learn today, guy?

37
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,980
I, I didn't realize that was him.

38
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,840
Until, like, I was like, oh my god, it's him.

39
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,960
He's, you gotta learn today, man.

40
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:19,820
That's him.

41
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:28,400
Anyway, um, I saw that he is apparently, um, really good at modern gif.

42
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:34,140
And, um, he offered his, like, expertise as an assistant coach.

43
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,660
To any of the Sajam Slammers.

44
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,220
So, I was like, I'm playing modern gif.

45
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,520
He plays modern gif.

46
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:44,860
So, like, I was like, you know, I'm just gonna ask him if he's free.

47
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:55,060
Like, I'm just gonna ask him if he's, like, free and if he's, like, open to, like, coaching me on some modern gif, zen gif.

48
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,920
Because, like, he did offer.

49
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,500
So, I hit him up and I was like, oh yeah, can you, like, coach me?

50
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,100
Like, I don't know what I'm doing.

51
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:11,280
Like, um, and he was like, yeah, sure.

52
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,700
And that's why today we have a stream.

53
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,560
Because I thought, might as well.

54
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:24,400
I mean, I am collaborating with one of the, uh, most well-known FGC competitors, um, in the scene.

55
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:28,000
I mean, that man has, like, what, nine EVO champion titles?

56
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:28,840
Which is a lot.

57
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:32,100
That's actually a lot, now that I think about it.

58
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:43,980
Um, um, one of the most well-known, um, FGC, uh, competitors in the community.

59
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:47,100
So, I was like, yeah, I should stream.

60
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,420
I was like, I should stream.

61
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:55,120
Is it fucked that I haven't had a stream with my actual coach, but have a stream?

62
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:57,440
My first stream.

63
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:02,480
My first coaching session stream isn't even with, like, my actual coach.

64
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:08,360
Hey, I was at my coach's stream earlier today.

65
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:09,300
Chat.

66
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:14,260
I was at... if you checked Brian F's VODs, I was there.

67
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,360
I was there.

68
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,460
I just didn't stream it on my own channel.

69
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:23,380
But like, you're gonna see Brian in like, for like three other streams.

70
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:28,020
Guys, there's round robin one, there's round robin two, and there's finals.

71
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:31,580
But there's only one J1 stream, okay?

72
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:35,440
Like, in the end, in the end, it balances out.

73
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,340
It balances out everybody.

74
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,960
I was at two Brian streams, okay.

75
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:45,300
I was at two of his streams.

76
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,260
I just didn't stream it myself.

77
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,900
Hey, thank you.

78
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:49,300
Super chat.

79
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:49,600
Thank you.

80
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:50,000
Thank you.

81
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,040
You have an actual coach.

82
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:51,400
Yes.

83
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:55,380
I finally like got coaching yesterday

84
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:04,980
It was actually pretty good, because like I I finally know like the fundamentals, because I have no idea what I'm doing.

85
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,400
I still don't know what I'm doing.

86
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,680
I'll let you know right now.

87
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:08,600
I...

88
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:13,240
I like Tekken more than Street Fighter after learning both games.

89
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,400
The number one reason why...

90
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,700
Let me explain.

91
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,060
Let me explain.

92
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:26,600
The number one reason why is that in Tekken, I don't have to block.

93
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:33,860
I can just be aggressive throughout it as a grappler.

94
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:39,140
But in Street Fighter, I actually have to block and it's not fun.

95
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:42,440
It's so frustrating.

96
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,560
I've never been so angry before.

97
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:49,680
Like I've actually never been so fucking mad.

98
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:56,010
Like playing Street Fighter is...

99
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,120
Exactly!

100
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:02,660
I did not pay $70 to fucking block, but I have to.

101
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,840
It's so bullshit.

102
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:08,060
Like it's so fucking bullshit that I have to block.

103
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,440
And like...

104
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:18,200
And I found out that like in Street Fighter, like I have to like use my brain.

105
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,260
Because I can't button mash in Street Fighter.

106
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:23,340
It's... I'm so mad.

107
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,580
I actually... I can't button mash.

108
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,120
I can't button mash in Street Fighter.

109
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:29,800
Like because it doesn't...

110
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,300
It doesn't do anything.

111
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,520
It punishes you more than like...

112
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:37,780
It punishes you more than like...

113
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,600
Than like Tekken.

114
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:43,240
So... I don't know if you guys know this but in...

115
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,360
Okay maybe you do.

116
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:45,700
It's sort of very noticeable.

117
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,020
But in Tekken I like do moves that I sort of know how to do.

118
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:54,440
And I also like mix in button mashing at the same time.

119
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,460
So like...

120
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,560
I do have moves that I can do.

121
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:08,520
I know what I'm doing, but I also mix in button mashing to keep myself random and unpredictable, so now I'm like, no, now I am predictable, because I can't button mash!

122
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,400
So, it's so frustrating.

123
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:25,640
Anyway, I know I am not the best player in my division, 100%, I know for sure.

124
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,380
Like, everybody was fucking grinding.

125
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:36,880
Like, I think, like, I've been playing Street Fighter the last three days, but like, I know I'm very behind.

126
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:50,640
I'm currently Silver 1 at the moment, and like, I know I'm not the best player in my division, but like, I'm gonna try so fucking hard to not be the worst player.

127
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:55,600
Like, my goal, my goal is to be better.

128
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,520
Better than one person.

129
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,720
That's all I care about.

130
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:01,780
That's...

131
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:03,360
That's actually...

132
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,860
As long as I'm...

133
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:09,880
Sorry, I had Jwon stream on, just because I want to know if he's, like, what he's doing right now.

134
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,800
So, if you heard, like, you heard her sound in the background, I was like, okay, what is he talking about?

135
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:20,560
Anyway, I told Jwon I just want to talk to you guys first before, like, I'm ready...

136
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,800
I'm ready to be in the call.

137
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:30,400
But yeah, basically, like, just not the worst.

138
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,700
That's, like, all I care about.

139
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:37,260
As long as, like, I'm not the worst player in my division, like, I'm happy.

140
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,980
And that's why I need...

141
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,800
I need Justin to, like...

142
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,480
I need him to fix me.

143
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:45,660
I literally...

144
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:51,760
I literally changed my Street Fighter schedule just so I could be coached by him.

145
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,000
Because, like, when it...

146
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,260
When...

147
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:55,880
Even when Bryan had, like, you know, a real...

148
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,740
A natural life.

149
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,160
Like, an actual life where he...

150
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,780
He couldn't coach after, like, 8pm.

151
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,280
Like, I didn't care.

152
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:09,480
Like, I was just like, alright, I'm willing to, like, have fun, like, secondhand coaching.

153
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,520
Like, trickle-down coaching from Brawl Pro.

154
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:12,580
Like, I...

155
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,280
Because I was just like...

156
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,820
I was like, I don't want to...

157
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:21,300
I don't want to play Street Fighter so early.

158
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:22,960
But then...

159
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,620
But I changed my schedule.

160
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,400
I changed...

161
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,000
I changed my...

162
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,700
My...

163
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:33,660
My Street Fighter schedule so I could get coached by Justin.

164
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:34,840
I'm sorry, Bryan.

165
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,580
Like, I didn't change it for you.

166
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:37,820
I changed it for Justin.

167
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:42,580
I...

168
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:46,940
Guys!

169
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,500
You would have done the same thing.

170
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,560
Don't fucking...

171
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,580
You would have done the same...

172
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:53,220
Thing.

173
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:54,180
Like...

174
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,860
You guys...

175
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,280
Like, don't fucking judge me.

176
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:05,440
Because I know all of you would have done the same thing if you were getting coached by Justin Wong.

177
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:06,220
Like...

178
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,880
Justin won 9 EVOs.

179
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,580
Bryan has won...

180
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,720
Bryan's a great coach, by the way.

181
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,040
Great content.

182
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,140
Great guys.

183
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,600
Great Street Fighter guys.

184
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,560
But he's not EVO.

185
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,580
He's...

186
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,500
He did great, though.

187
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,340
Bryan did great.

188
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:32,640
He taught me the fundamentals.

189
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:39,060
He taught me the fundamentals on Street Fighter for GEEF.

190
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:39,980
He was great.

191
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,300
But he's not Justin.

192
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,020
That's crazy.

193
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:53,740
I'm saying...

194
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,500
Ohh, RIP Bryan.

195
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,500
Guys, I'm saying...

196
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,460
He was great.

197
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,380
He actually helped me a lot.

198
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,180
Look, Bryan did the impossible.

199
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:04,260
He like...

200
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:07,000
He made me learn how to block, guys.

201
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,320
Guys, all I'm saying...

202
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,720
Bryan actually did the impossible.

203
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,660
And he taught me how to block.

204
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:15,740
I don't like it.

205
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:16,440
But like...

206
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,040
I fucking hate it.

207
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,160
But...

208
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,140
But...

209
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,480
But...

210
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:22,540
But...

211
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:30,100
But, Brian actually made sure I learned how to block and forced me to block and everything.

212
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:37,640
So, in the end, you know, like, people can fix me.

213
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:49,140
Like, my defense is definitely higher now than Tekken, that's for sure.

214
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:57,480
I think I am a better player, because I actually use my brain, in Street Fighter than in Tekken, because in Tekken I was basically head empty, unga bunga.

215
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,760
But in Street Fighter I actually have to think about what I'm doing.

216
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:12,900
And because I have to think, I have to be like, okay, I have to block this, and then he's gonna do that, and I have to read, like, what he might do next and everything.

217
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:15,060
And I'm just like, I fucking hate this.

218
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:20,870
Bro, bro, I hate this!

219
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:23,490
It's like I was I was hard-stuck.

220
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:33,130
I was hard-stuck Bronze for four no, I was hard-stuck bronze five for four fucking hours.

221
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:34,330
I was

222
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:56,810
Brawl pro and this I literally wrote I hate Street Fighter

223
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:16,980
I'm silver one now, by the way, I'm silver I'm silver one now, but it was not a good time

224
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:27,240
It was so fucking, I'm so, I'm so done.

225
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:29,420
I'm so fucking done

226
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:37,940
This is at 547 a.m.

227
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:50,880
Oh my god, it was just it's just not a great time for me

228
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:54,980
It's not a great time.

229
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:08,100
I guess I just I need to like understand I don't know how to do, I still don't know how to do combos guys Is getting silver in three days good or is it that bad?

230
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:09,000
You know what?

231
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:23,080
No There's so many bronze and silver players while I was queuing if they've been silver for like fucking Five plus months and they're still in silver you're fucking dog shit.

232
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:23,640
I'm sorry

233
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:30,880
I'm just trying to make myself feel better.

234
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:31,680
I'm sorry you guys

235
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:50,880
Hey, it took me three days to get to silver it took me three days I Was very miserable, but it took me three days

236
00:16:54,980 --> 00:17:09,980
No, you don't understand I hate so I blocked so many people like Like any time when I queue up a rank and I get anybody that was like a thousand plus points above me I blocked them afterwards.

237
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:28,320
I was like fuck you Why am I fighting you and it one game block Why block because I found help if you block them afterwards you don't get them again You know you don't get them again.

238
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:37,060
I was like fuck off Why am I against you you have a thousand plus points above me?

239
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,320
Why are you fighting me?

240
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:40,500
You don't?

241
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:46,260
I don't know what I'm doing I blocked everybody though.

242
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:51,000
I I am blocked everybody right after don't worry.

243
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:58,420
I I made sure I'm not sure to unblock everybody before the stream so that you guys won't see my block list.

244
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:02,340
You guys won't see the people I blocked.

245
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:11,140
I blocked everybody that like pissed me off and had like a thousand plus points above me.

246
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,980
And I just didn't want to fight them again.

247
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:14,800
I was like, no, get out of my queue.

248
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:19,000
I am so tired.

249
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,560
I'm trying to learn and I'm so tired.

250
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:34,080
I'm getting fucking demolished by people who actually know what they're doing.

251
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,260
I'm so tired.

252
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,360
Oh yeah, I won and done to everybody by the way.

253
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:42,300
It doesn't matter.

254
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:49,340
It doesn't matter that like I beat them or not.

255
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,620
I won and done to everybody.

256
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,580
Like I had... I like...

257
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,820
I treated everybody equally by the way.

258
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,360
I treated everybody the same.

259
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,300
I do one game and I'm done.

260
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,540
I don't want to see you again.

261
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,000
I don't want to see you again.

262
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:05,380
A win is a win and I don't want to see you again.

263
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,400
I already had a miserable time fighting you.

264
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:14,060
I already had a terrible time fighting you.

265
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:14,720
No matter what.

266
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,760
Even if I won, I didn't have fun.

267
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:17,600
Blocked.

268
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:18,660
Oh wait, not blocked.

269
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:19,620
Um, quit.

270
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:22,720
Blocking was only reserved.

271
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:26,380
For people above 1000 points above me.

272
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:27,360
That's...

273
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:31,280
No disrespect on an elite level.

274
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,260
This way.

275
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,360
Anyway, alright.

276
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:43,560
I'll message...

277
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:45,500
I'll message...

278
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,060
Justin that I'm ready.

279
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,560
By the way...

280
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:54,260
By the way, Brian made me fight people more than once.

281
00:19:56,220 --> 00:20:02,760
Also, the reason why I won and done is because it makes me so happy.

282
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:07,400
Especially when I won and done people with a winning streak.

283
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,560
Because I know how much that pisses them off.

284
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:15,700
If they lose to me and they had a winning streak...

285
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:18,880
I don't even give them... I won and done...

286
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,100
Oh my god, it made me feel so good inside.

287
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:22,300
Won and done-ing that.

288
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:29,880
I was like, 6th winning streak...

289
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,220
Wow, it would be a shame if you lose that.

290
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,720
Anyway, quit.

291
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:37,840
Now you're actually just evil.

292
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,680
But yeah.

293
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,660
I don't let people fire me.

294
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,780
And I don't fire people.

295
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,420
That's how I am.

296
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:56,960
Please don't promote this behavior, Doki.

297
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,240
Guys, it's okay.

298
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,440
Guys, I don't know...

299
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:03,320
I'm new here in the FGC community.

300
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,920
Guys, I'm just ignorant.

301
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:09,860
I'm just ignorant and I'll still be ignorant.

302
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:10,600
Like...

303
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,920
Please, dude.

304
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,740
It's pretty messed up.

305
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,780
It's my first day.

306
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,700
It's my first day, guys.

307
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:26,460
Okay.

308
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,640
Anyway, I didn't won and done when I was on Brian's stream.

309
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,140
I actually played my games out.

310
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,920
Because my coach judged me.

311
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,140
And like...

312
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:37,500
I only won and done...

313
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:38,660
Twice.

314
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,980
I only won and done twice.

315
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,880
During Brian's stream.

316
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,460
Because I ruined some...

317
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:47,840
I ruined a Marisa's 7th game winning streak.

318
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,120
And I was like...

319
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:49,560
No, you...

320
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:49,960
You're...

321
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,140
I was like...

322
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:53,660
You're not getting a rematch.

323
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,760
You lost your...

324
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,080
You lost your bonus?

325
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,580
Oh my gosh.

326
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:01,300
What a shame.

327
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,360
You lost your bonus rank XP from me?

328
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,300
What a shame.

329
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,480
Guess we'll never see each other again.

330
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:12,420
And I won and done on stream.

331
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:16,140
And I also did it to...

332
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,720
The last game I did on the stream.

333
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,020
Just because I was like...

334
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:20,840
I won.

335
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,200
I was like...

336
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:22,900
This was my LG.

337
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,180
I won.

338
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,080
Okay, bye.

339
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:30,720
Anyway.

340
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,800
I'll message Justin for real now.

341
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:35,440
I'll message Justin for real.

342
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,100
I'm not that toxic.

343
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:37,500
Right?

344
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:38,460
Alright.

345
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:39,560
Alright.

346
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,260
I'm in the...

347
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,100
Sajam Slam Discord.

348
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:46,740
VC.

349
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,760
All right.

350
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,160
Let me make sure my Discord thing is...

351
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:52,520
Okay.

352
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:54,140
All right.

353
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,340
I'm gonna make sure I have everything set up for this.

354
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,420
Oh my god.

355
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,000
Guys, I think I played...

356
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,540
I think I played Street Fighter for like...

357
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:05,980
Ugh.

358
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,140
10 hours today.

359
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:09,200
I'm not okay.

360
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:10,120
Like not...

361
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:10,940
I think 8 hours?

362
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:12,060
No, I'll say 8 hours.

363
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,040
I did 5 hours of rank.

364
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:14,880
Yeah.

365
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:15,500
And then I did...

366
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,720
2 to 3 hours.

367
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,040
I think 2 hours of...

368
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:18,620
Ryan?

369
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:19,900
7 hours.

370
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,620
7 hours of Street Fighter.

371
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:23,780
And I guess we'll get to 10 today.

372
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:24,760
We'll get to 10.

373
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,120
We'll get to 10 today.

374
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,280
That sounds...

375
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,620
Guys, why did you think I...

376
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,540
Guys, why do you think I wrote this?

377
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,320
That sounds terrible.

378
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,940
This was my mental.

379
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,300
This is how I felt.

380
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:42,800
Like this is how I was mentally at that time.

381
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:46,620
It was not okay.

382
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:46,700
I'm sorry.

383
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,080
Okay.

384
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:55,060
They hate me...

385
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:58,320
They hate me by playing Modern Geek as much as I just...

386
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,180
As I hate them.

387
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:05,460
Alright!

388
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:06,760
Let's see.

389
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:08,440
Let's see.

390
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,100
I got a message.

391
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:10,300
Ohhh.

392
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,080
Okay, I'll just call him.

393
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:15,640
I didn't notice he has no perms.

394
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:16,340
Hahaha.

395
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:24,000
He doesn't have perms in the voice chat.

396
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:24,980
Like what the fuck?

397
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,400
He's the assistant coach.

398
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:28,560
I was in the public PC.

399
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:29,440
Oh hey!

400
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:31,200
I didn't realize you had no perms.

401
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,680
I got nothing.

402
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,120
I just have access.

403
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,380
I just can view.

404
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:35,860
That's it.

405
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,800
But you're the assistant coach!

406
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:41,380
How do you have zero access as an assistant coach?

407
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,100
Maybe they forgot.

408
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:43,740
I don't know.

409
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:47,000
Oh my god, they forgot the Justin Wong?

410
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:48,400
That's fucked.

411
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:49,660
That means you're washed now.

412
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:55,040
Yeah, you know, I think they were upset that I turned down the coaching role.

413
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,200
They were upset.

414
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,080
I was like, I can help, but I don't want to full-time it.

415
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:03,040
Damn.

416
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:04,360
Damn.

417
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,720
And then they're like, alright, permission revoked.

418
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,380
You can only get FOMO and just look from the outside.

419
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:13,340
You can just watch everybody else have fun.

420
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:13,720
You're like, I don't know.

421
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:15,680
You're like that Squidward meme where you're inside.

422
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,260
You're just looking out the window.

423
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:17,840
Oh yeah, it's house and everything.

424
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,480
That's a good one right there.

425
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:24,540
I can definitely see myself just staring outside.

426
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,260
Everybody at TwitchCon having fun.

427
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,180
Wait, why couldn't you coach anyway?

428
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:30,580
What took your time?

429
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,360
Just busy.

430
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:36,980
My daughter, she's five and she's going to kindergarten.

431
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:38,100
Yeah, yeah.

432
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:40,400
So I'm not going to have time to be able to...

433
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,700
Yeah, you gotta spend time with your kid.

434
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:43,700
You know?

435
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:43,940
Yeah.

436
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:44,840
Yeah, yeah.

437
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,640
You gotta make sure that...

438
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,540
Okay, I shouldn't say it.

439
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,580
I was going to say something.

440
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,760
Out of respect, I wouldn't.

441
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,120
I won't say it.

442
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:00,400
Are you online?

443
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:01,740
Yeah, yeah.

444
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:02,180
I'm online.

445
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:02,620
Yeah.

446
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,440
Oh, I got the invitation.

447
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,080
Wait, is that your invitation?

448
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:06,380
Like, Chaeyoung?

449
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:06,980
Yeah, that's me.

450
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:07,800
Okay, okay.

451
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:09,160
Yeah, that's me.

452
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:09,860
All right.

453
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:10,600
I'm heading over.

454
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:12,500
All right.

455
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:12,680
I'm heading over.

456
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:22,050
Okay, so I want to go into the training mode and see what do you know?

457
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:24,570
Oh, that's a good question.

458
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:27,310
I watched the last three of your matches.

459
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:27,710
Yeah.

460
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:31,310
And you had really good reactions with the level three.

461
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:32,930
So I was really impressed with that one.

462
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:33,390
Oh, yeah, yeah.

463
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:34,370
Oh, really?

464
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:36,490
Everyone keeps going, whoa, when I do it.

465
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:39,110
But it's like, what's the easiest out of everything?

466
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:41,490
That was because you were aware.

467
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:42,990
That's the most important part.

468
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:43,950
Yeah.

469
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:44,050
Yeah.

470
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:45,110
I have eyes.

471
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:50,790
Trust me, people's eyes sometimes a little bit slow, so I'm not sure.

472
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:52,090
Okay.

473
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:52,850
All right.

474
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:53,190
Let me...

475
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:54,050
All right.

476
00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:55,930
I'm just adjusting the volume real quick.

477
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:56,350
All right.

478
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:57,390
Yeah.

479
00:26:57,870 --> 00:26:58,630
All right.

480
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:04,350
I saw that when you do drive impact, right?

481
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:04,690
Yeah.

482
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:07,890
You go for just this, right?

483
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:08,330
Yeah.

484
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:08,510
Yeah.

485
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:09,030
The yeehaw.

486
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:10,470
The yeehaw.

487
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:10,890
Yeah.

488
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:14,870
I would say sometimes if you get the drive impact...

489
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:17,310
Let's say, can you drive impact me?

490
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:18,030
Yeah.

491
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:18,610
Okay.

492
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:22,510
And you could do this as well, too.

493
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:23,990
You probably know this.

494
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:26,870
Yeah.

495
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:27,090
Yeah.

496
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:27,430
The...

497
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:29,410
The auto heavy combo.

498
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:29,770
Yeah.

499
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:35,830
I feel like that's really good as well.

500
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:38,350
I know you like to use this move.

501
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:39,750
Yeah, I do.

502
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:42,610
It's like I use this and then the heavy punch.

503
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:43,570
Yeah.

504
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:44,370
This move...

505
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:45,690
Have you used this move at all?

506
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:45,910
Yeah.

507
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:46,650
I have used the slap.

508
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:48,630
The slap.

509
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:48,950
Yeah.

510
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:49,250
I would say...

511
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:53,430
I would say use that more because especially if you're like here, it's like really...

512
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:57,410
It's going to be really hard for people to punish that from the silver level.

513
00:27:58,650 --> 00:27:59,050
Yeah.

514
00:27:59,050 --> 00:27:59,110
Right?

515
00:27:59,390 --> 00:27:59,790
Yeah.

516
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:00,470
Like see...

517
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:04,150
Because if it says counter hit, you get the guaranteed three hits.

518
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:05,310
Okay.

519
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:08,430
But I guess like the range...

520
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:09,290
Which range is better?

521
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:12,530
Is the range for the cartwheel more or...

522
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:13,970
Or just that?

523
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:14,630
So it's because...

524
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,130
It's because let's say you do the cartwheel.

525
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:17,790
Yeah.

526
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:19,110
I can...

527
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:21,370
I can literally go to the...

528
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:25,390
To the bathroom, come back and still punish you for doing that.

529
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:27,210
You know?

530
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:27,490
All right.

531
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:28,330
Do it.

532
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:30,490
So like I...

533
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:31,690
So like it's good.

534
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:33,390
But that would say if...

535
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:34,950
People would be like, oh look.

536
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:35,550
Yeah.

537
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:36,770
Like just block high.

538
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:38,330
Like just block high.

539
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:39,770
And then you're like kind of like...

540
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:40,510
Okay.

541
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:41,130
In a bad situation.

542
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:42,730
So just do this instead.

543
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:43,810
Okay.

544
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:46,350
I would say don't do it as much.

545
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:47,990
You know, you change it up a little bit.

546
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:48,170
Right?

547
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:48,450
Yeah.

548
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:48,690
Yeah.

549
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:48,830
Yeah.

550
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:51,390
And when you jump like...

551
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:52,830
What button do you like to use for jumping?

552
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:54,390
I just...

553
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:55,650
I like to do the down X.

554
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:56,710
Yeah.

555
00:28:57,650 --> 00:28:58,870
And then what do you do after that?

556
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:02,150
I do this and then poke, poke, poke.

557
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:03,950
And then smash.

558
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:06,450
So what you could do if they block this.

559
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:07,790
Like yeah.

560
00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:08,190
Just block it.

561
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:08,290
Yeah.

562
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:10,710
Just go to grab right away.

563
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:11,350
Oh, okay.

564
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:12,150
Just grab right away.

565
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:12,530
Okay.

566
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:13,470
Yeah.

567
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:14,850
Okay.

568
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:15,310
Yep.

569
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:18,310
And then now let's say if they know...

570
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:22,170
If they think you're going to grab, that's when you go poke, poke, poke.

571
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:25,350
So think of it as like when you put me...

572
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:26,650
When you make somebody block.

573
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:27,410
Yeah.

574
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:29,450
You choose heads or tails.

575
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:30,230
Yeah.

576
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:31,010
So your head...

577
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:33,070
Think of like your head is the command throw.

578
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:33,950
Uh-huh.

579
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:37,630
And then your tails is poke, poke, poke.

580
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:38,270
Okay.

581
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:38,570
Okay.

582
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:39,590
Right.

583
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:49,490
So it's like you constantly get the people guessing and then that will help you like in terms of like making more... getting more damage on the table, I would say.

584
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:49,990
Okay.

585
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:50,970
I see.

586
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:51,150
I see.

587
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:52,130
Because if somebody is like...

588
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:57,110
Let's say somebody coaches the other person when you're fighting and they're like, yeah, she only just does grab.

589
00:29:57,210 --> 00:29:58,290
So just hold up.

590
00:29:58,650 --> 00:29:59,090
Okay.

591
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:03,690
So then every time you will go for a grab, they just hold up and your grab will never work.

592
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:04,610
Yeah.

593
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:05,230
Right.

594
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:07,710
So then you have to put the tails option.

595
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:19,950
Where like, okay, if they hold up, let's say you do that string, like jump in and press the light and then do that one.

596
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:21,970
Yeah.

597
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:22,770
Just press it right away.

598
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:26,170
You see, I can't hold up there.

599
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:26,410
Yeah.

600
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:27,610
I get hit.

601
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:34,830
So then now after you do two, two of the lights, like two of that after.

602
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:35,430
Yeah.

603
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:35,630
Yeah.

604
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:39,650
Go into the OD.

605
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:40,470
Okay.

606
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:40,770
Okay.

607
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:42,250
Yeah.

608
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:42,810
So try that.

609
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:45,530
Okay.

610
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:49,970
So don't can't don't press it right away.

611
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:50,390
Okay.

612
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:51,150
Just wait a little bit.

613
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:53,310
No.

614
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:53,750
Okay.

615
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:54,490
That's just reflex.

616
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:55,590
Yeah.

617
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:55,850
Yeah.

618
00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:55,970
Yeah.

619
00:30:57,170 --> 00:30:58,050
Oh my God.

620
00:30:58,130 --> 00:30:59,430
So you have to do the OD.

621
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:00,750
Okay.

622
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:05,190
There you go.

623
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:05,410
Oh my God.

624
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:05,530
Okay.

625
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:07,250
I'm getting it.

626
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:07,730
I'm learning.

627
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:09,010
Yeah.

628
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:11,390
And then do you use this move at all?

629
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:15,830
Oh, not a lot, but sometimes.

630
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:17,690
Okay.

631
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:21,750
I think like when I'm like head empty and I don't think I bring it out.

632
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:24,910
So this is also a very strong button.

633
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:33,450
So if you do, so if you do jump in with this, the medium, you can also go into that.

634
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:33,970
Okay.

635
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:34,570
As well.

636
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:41,570
And that really is strong because think of this as like they can't press a button afterwards.

637
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:42,670
Uh huh.

638
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:49,110
So like for example, I want you to do head butt and then into this button right away.

639
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:50,030
Okay.

640
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:51,790
All right.

641
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:55,670
You see, you see how it says counter hit?

642
00:31:55,770 --> 00:31:56,030
Yeah.

643
00:31:56,090 --> 00:31:56,990
I try to press the button.

644
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:58,630
I can't win there.

645
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:00,310
Okay.

646
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:03,750
And then.

647
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:03,950
Okay.

648
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:09,290
And so now once you do that, you can go for the command throw.

649
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:10,410
Command throw.

650
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:11,030
Okay.

651
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:16,570
So after the head butt, square square and then command throw.

652
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:16,910
The OD.

653
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:17,430
Yeah.

654
00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:18,190
The OD SPD.

655
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:19,650
Okay.

656
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:24,710
Right.

657
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:32,770
Or, or let's say you, you know, they're not going to press a button because they're, they, they're scared of you doing this after the head butt.

658
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:33,870
Yeah.

659
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:34,990
And then you, uh, can you block for me?

660
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:35,370
Yeah.

661
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:38,910
And you just go into the command throw.

662
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:39,390
Okay.

663
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:40,670
Yeah.

664
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:45,770
Oh, you're okay.

665
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:46,090
Okay.

666
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:47,550
That was too fast.

667
00:32:47,610 --> 00:32:49,470
At least you're, at least you're good at canceling.

668
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:50,950
Most people are not good at canceling.

669
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:55,110
I'm trying my best.

670
00:32:55,530 --> 00:32:55,910
Oh.

671
00:32:57,990 --> 00:32:58,390
Oh.

672
00:32:58,690 --> 00:32:58,950
You do.

673
00:32:58,990 --> 00:32:59,150
Yeah.

674
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:00,250
You just have to wait.

675
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:00,650
Yeah.

676
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:01,150
And then you do it.

677
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:02,550
I'm very impatient.

678
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:03,510
Yeah.

679
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:03,850
I'm trying my best.

680
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:06,350
Another thing that's really good as well too.

681
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:07,550
So can you block low?

682
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:08,110
Yeah.

683
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:11,930
It's just doing, cause I want to teach you like sequences.

684
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:12,670
Cool.

685
00:33:12,770 --> 00:33:16,410
So you just follow a sequence and then you just literally, it's like reading a book.

686
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:20,830
Like it's like reading, like how to, how to, how to cook a scramble egg.

687
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:24,310
You know, you watch a YouTube video and you're like, okay, step one, step two, step three.

688
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:24,670
Okay.

689
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:25,790
Right.

690
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:32,370
So you do auto heavy crouching, crouching light, auto heavy crouching light.

691
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:33,150
Oh my God.

692
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:33,890
Okay.

693
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:34,910
That's.

694
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:38,650
All right.

695
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:40,090
Okay.

696
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:40,870
I can do this.

697
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:41,890
Yeah.

698
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:42,690
Yeah.

699
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:43,410
There you go.

700
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:43,770
See?

701
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:44,530
Uh huh.

702
00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:44,970
Whoops.

703
00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:46,010
Yeah.

704
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:46,970
Just don't match it.

705
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:47,870
Just don't match it like that.

706
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:49,070
Look at that.

707
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:50,290
Oh, nice.

708
00:33:50,770 --> 00:33:51,170
Yeah.

709
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:52,730
So you can do up to three times.

710
00:33:54,010 --> 00:33:54,410
Okay.

711
00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:55,790
And then now.

712
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:57,310
After the third time, what do we do?

713
00:33:58,050 --> 00:34:00,630
So after the third time you do.

714
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:01,870
Okay.

715
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:03,130
Okay.

716
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:04,850
Back special.

717
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:06,670
Oh, that's my favorite.

718
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:07,570
Yeah.

719
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:07,930
I know.

720
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:08,250
I saw.

721
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:12,130
It's my knowledge check.

722
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:14,230
If they don't check it, I'll just do it.

723
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:15,890
Okay.

724
00:34:15,890 --> 00:34:16,290
Now do it.

725
00:34:16,490 --> 00:34:16,890
Yeah.

726
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:19,930
You got sequences.

727
00:34:20,170 --> 00:34:20,810
You got sequences.

728
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:21,250
Right?

729
00:34:21,330 --> 00:34:21,570
Okay.

730
00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:26,510
And let's say in the middle of it, you're like, okay, they're going to keep blocking it.

731
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:27,190
So now block.

732
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:28,130
Okay.

733
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:29,970
Tick, tick.

734
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:32,610
I am almighty.

735
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:33,130
Oh my God.

736
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:34,450
Oh, and then it's throw time.

737
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:35,390
Yeah.

738
00:34:35,470 --> 00:34:39,710
Cause you're in range to go for the throw after the headbutt every single time.

739
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:40,670
Okay.

740
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:42,430
Okay.

741
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:42,950
I see.

742
00:34:43,910 --> 00:34:44,990
Oh my God.

743
00:34:46,530 --> 00:34:46,970
Yep.

744
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:48,690
Yep.

745
00:34:48,930 --> 00:34:49,650
There you go.

746
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:54,270
So if you, if you mix that up a lot, that helps a lot.

747
00:34:54,490 --> 00:34:55,710
Another good sequence.

748
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:57,230
Yeah.

749
00:34:58,390 --> 00:34:58,830
Yeah.

750
00:34:58,930 --> 00:34:59,790
You have to press it one time.

751
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:00,710
Don't press it two times.

752
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:02,190
That's all.

753
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:05,030
Oh, whoops.

754
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:07,770
I'm so used to button mashing.

755
00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:11,730
It's hard to button mash in this game.

756
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:12,390
I know.

757
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:13,870
I learned that the hard way.

758
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:18,870
Nice.

759
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:22,250
So another one you can do is, uh, could you block low for me?

760
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:22,590
Yeah.

761
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:31,770
Cause if you do three, uh, the crouching lights like this and afterwards do forward medium.

762
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:32,670
Okay.

763
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:35,630
Yeah.

764
00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:38,850
Oh.

765
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:40,990
Yep.

766
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:43,870
Yep.

767
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:49,930
So now the reason why you do that is, um, can you, can you press start?

768
00:35:50,330 --> 00:35:54,250
Um, and can you hit right bumper or what are you, what are you playing on?

769
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:55,530
I'm playing on a leverless.

770
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:56,630
Okay.

771
00:35:57,430 --> 00:35:59,730
With PlayStation symbols on it.

772
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:00,790
Okay.

773
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:02,570
Does it say right bumper?

774
00:36:02,770 --> 00:36:03,110
Yeah.

775
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:04,930
Right bumper.

776
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:08,070
When you press, when you press start, you know how there's like three settings.

777
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:10,910
It's like basic settings, screen display settings.

778
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:13,190
Oh, basic settings.

779
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:13,390
R1.

780
00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:13,530
R1.

781
00:36:13,850 --> 00:36:14,870
Oh, basic settings.

782
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:16,370
Uh, what do you mean by that?

783
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:20,330
Oh, like if you hit, if you hit start, you got that purple menu that come up.

784
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:20,490
Yeah.

785
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:20,790
Yeah.

786
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:21,030
Yeah.

787
00:36:21,410 --> 00:36:22,950
R1 and L1.

788
00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:23,890
Yeah.

789
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:26,530
Can you hit R1 to go to screen display settings?

790
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:28,050
Screen display.

791
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:28,310
Yeah.

792
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:30,930
And can you turn on the frame meter?

793
00:36:31,370 --> 00:36:31,770
Okay.

794
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:33,090
Okay.

795
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:33,250
Yeah.

796
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:34,830
Now you see this.

797
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:36,250
Have you seen this bar before?

798
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:36,790
Oh yeah.

799
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:39,050
Everybody else, all the professionals have it.

800
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:39,890
Yeah.

801
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:40,210
Okay.

802
00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:41,950
And all the same jam slammers, except for me.

803
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:43,130
Until now.

804
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:44,330
All right.

805
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:46,650
I don't know how to read this.

806
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:48,170
Blue means...

807
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:48,690
So just know this.

808
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:49,810
So blue means good.

809
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:50,650
Red means bad.

810
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:51,410
Okay.

811
00:36:52,270 --> 00:36:52,710
Okay.

812
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:56,150
So now, for example, do the, do your cartwheel.

813
00:36:58,130 --> 00:36:58,570
Oh.

814
00:36:58,670 --> 00:36:59,550
You see that number?

815
00:36:59,730 --> 00:36:59,970
Yeah.

816
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:00,630
The seven.

817
00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:01,070
Seven.

818
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:02,030
Yeah.

819
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:03,070
So that's, it's red.

820
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:03,490
It's red for you.

821
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:04,010
So it's bad.

822
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:04,670
Yeah.

823
00:37:04,850 --> 00:37:04,950
Yeah.

824
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:05,350
Right.

825
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:07,470
So now do the headbutt.

826
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:08,670
The headbutt.

827
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:08,890
Okay.

828
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:11,150
You see?

829
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:12,370
That's blue for you.

830
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:13,490
It says four frames.

831
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:13,790
Yeah.

832
00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:14,730
Yeah.

833
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:16,930
So that means, that means...

834
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:22,730
Do you remember like simple math, like negative one, negative two?

835
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:25,510
I'll have you know, I almost failed math, but like, yeah.

836
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:32,670
We can try.

837
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:33,750
We can try together.

838
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:34,970
Okay.

839
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:35,810
Okay.

840
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:35,970
Okay.

841
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:36,790
All right.

842
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:37,890
So this button, right?

843
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:42,590
This is, this is, um, I, I'm not, I'm not trying to, I don't want you to remember the map.

844
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:43,630
I just want to give you an example.

845
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:43,830
Yeah.

846
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:44,350
Yeah.

847
00:37:44,650 --> 00:37:44,970
Yeah.

848
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:47,710
So this button is six frames.

849
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:48,410
Okay.

850
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:50,010
Just say the number six.

851
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:51,110
Okay.

852
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:51,650
Okay.

853
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:52,690
Why does it say eight?

854
00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:53,410
What?

855
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:54,790
No, no, no.

856
00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:55,370
Don't look at that.

857
00:37:55,410 --> 00:37:56,030
Don't look at that.

858
00:37:56,050 --> 00:37:56,230
Okay.

859
00:37:56,410 --> 00:37:56,730
Okay.

860
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:58,470
Just look at the number of startup.

861
00:37:58,470 --> 00:37:59,590
Look at the startup number.

862
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:00,050
Okay.

863
00:38:00,050 --> 00:38:00,170
Okay.

864
00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:00,310
Okay.

865
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:01,430
Okay.

866
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:02,570
It's just six, right?

867
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:03,430
Yeah.

868
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:03,830
Yeah.

869
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:04,170
Yes.

870
00:38:04,570 --> 00:38:05,090
Okay.

871
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:07,710
You play like card games.

872
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:10,310
What type?

873
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:11,110
Goldfish?

874
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:12,770
Solitaire?

875
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:14,750
That's not the type of card game.

876
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:15,870
I'm talking about like, all right.

877
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:16,290
You know what?

878
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:16,590
Alright.

879
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:18,050
Like what?

880
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:18,490
TFT?

881
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:20,750
Like Pokemon.

882
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:21,530
Yu-Gi-Oh.

883
00:38:21,730 --> 00:38:22,130
Oh.

884
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:23,970
That's outside of the...

885
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:25,370
I collected them.

886
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:28,430
Cause it looked pretty.

887
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:30,030
Really?

888
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:30,870
They were pretty.

889
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:32,630
Alright.

890
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:33,470
So now...

891
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:34,990
Could you block low for me?

892
00:38:36,870 --> 00:38:37,350
So...

893
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:39,650
The headbutt is...

894
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:40,150
Right?

895
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:42,030
Hold down back.

896
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:42,630
Hold down back.

897
00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:45,910
So this is plus four.

898
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:46,890
Meaning...

899
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:48,950
I get the four frames.

900
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:49,630
I got the blue.

901
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:50,730
And you got the red.

902
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:53,770
So that means you have the red four.

903
00:38:54,610 --> 00:38:55,090
Okay?

904
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:57,590
So if you have red four...

905
00:38:57,590 --> 00:38:59,830
And you press your...

906
00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:02,290
Your six...

907
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:03,010
Your six...

908
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:05,190
Your six frame button.

909
00:39:05,330 --> 00:39:06,130
Which is this one.

910
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:07,950
That means...

911
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:10,190
That means you add on to that.

912
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:11,750
So that means it's...

913
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:14,390
That means it's number ten down.

914
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:15,050
Right?

915
00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:16,750
Yeah.

916
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:19,870
So that's why you lose.

917
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:20,750
Okay.

918
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:23,710
Just know that anytime you do something...

919
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:25,530
That's blue and you're blue...

920
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:27,230
You can keep...

921
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:27,970
Attacking.

922
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:29,330
If you're red...

923
00:39:29,330 --> 00:39:31,730
You cannot press any button.

924
00:39:32,330 --> 00:39:32,970
Okay.

925
00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:34,290
Okay?

926
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:34,950
Yeah.

927
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:36,910
So if you do...

928
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:39,490
You press this three times...

929
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:40,670
Into forward medium.

930
00:39:43,370 --> 00:39:43,690
Right?

931
00:39:43,830 --> 00:39:44,150
Yeah.

932
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:47,010
So keep doing that.

933
00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:51,210
Yeah.

934
00:39:51,310 --> 00:39:52,890
So you see if you wait...

935
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:55,110
If you do that sequence...

936
00:39:56,350 --> 00:39:57,070
Hold on.

937
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:57,390
Like...

938
00:39:57,590 --> 00:39:58,010
If you block low for me.

939
00:39:58,090 --> 00:39:58,330
Yeah.

940
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:01,330
Like if you...

941
00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:02,490
If you time it right...

942
00:40:02,490 --> 00:40:04,590
This will give you advantage.

943
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:06,030
Meaning like...

944
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:07,690
Like you'll turn blue.

945
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:11,510
Right?

946
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:11,670
Okay.

947
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:15,750
So let's see.

948
00:40:15,810 --> 00:40:16,310
Yeah like...

949
00:40:17,330 --> 00:40:18,890
I was able to turn blue earlier.

950
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:23,370
But like you could turn blue...

951
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:25,410
When you use this sequence.

952
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:27,290
So when you do this...

953
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:29,350
You can go into this right away.

954
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:30,070
Oh yeah.

955
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:34,030
Oh no see.

956
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:36,350
Oh my god I'm on the right side.

957
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:40,890
I don't play on this side.

958
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:44,010
No!

959
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:48,110
Don't do this to me.

960
00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:50,790
I'll just grapple into the other side.

961
00:40:51,890 --> 00:40:53,470
It doesn't work like that.

962
00:40:54,770 --> 00:40:55,630
I'll just...

963
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:56,910
No I'll do this.

964
00:40:57,290 --> 00:40:58,250
And then I'll...

965
00:40:58,250 --> 00:40:59,110
Oh wait not that side.

966
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:00,630
I'll do this.

967
00:41:00,970 --> 00:41:01,810
And then...

968
00:41:04,490 --> 00:41:05,390
I'll do this.

969
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:07,170
Okay.

970
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:08,590
Okay.

971
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:10,470
So I'll do this.

972
00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:13,230
And then I'll be on this side.

973
00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:16,190
And then I can do this.

974
00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:18,990
So you don't understand.

975
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:19,930
I can't.

976
00:41:19,930 --> 00:41:22,510
I don't understand the other side.

977
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:24,150
I don't understand the other side.

978
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:24,830
What if...

979
00:41:24,830 --> 00:41:27,510
What if they call for like...

980
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:29,150
What if you start as P2?

981
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:31,130
I'll just be like guys I'm...

982
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:33,430
Guys I'm really bad at...

983
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:35,190
I'm really bad at P1.

984
00:41:35,290 --> 00:41:36,150
Can I get P2?

985
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:37,390
And then they'll put me on P1.

986
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:41,690
That's the trick huh?

987
00:41:41,850 --> 00:41:42,930
Yeah that's the trick.

988
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:46,030
Yeah I'll be like oh guys can I please have P2?

989
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,490
I'm so bad at P1.

990
00:41:47,490 --> 00:41:48,710
And then...

991
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:50,310
Give me P1.

992
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:52,730
Okay okay.

993
00:41:53,230 --> 00:41:53,570
Alright.

994
00:41:54,810 --> 00:41:57,150
Try this sequence again.

995
00:41:57,250 --> 00:41:57,570
Okay.

996
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:01,210
Yeah so...

997
00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:02,610
Do it one time.

998
00:42:02,830 --> 00:42:04,050
And after that...

999
00:42:04,050 --> 00:42:06,210
Do the OD SPD.

1000
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:07,030
Okay okay.

1001
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:12,890
We have to do the OD part.

1002
00:42:13,290 --> 00:42:15,170
Yeah do the OD part.

1003
00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:16,550
Because the reason why...

1004
00:42:17,490 --> 00:42:18,270
We have to do this one...

1005
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:20,510
Is like let's say you're right here.

1006
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:21,010
Yeah.

1007
00:42:21,730 --> 00:42:23,970
My OD SPD will hit here.

1008
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:25,390
Okay.

1009
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:27,430
But if I do...

1010
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:31,070
If I do the OD one...

1011
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:33,550
Oh I didn't know that's the longer range.

1012
00:42:34,370 --> 00:42:34,790
And...

1013
00:42:35,210 --> 00:42:37,610
Yeah it's a very long range.

1014
00:42:37,770 --> 00:42:38,750
So like even from...

1015
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:39,730
Maybe from here.

1016
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:40,550
You see?

1017
00:42:41,110 --> 00:42:43,890
We should use that like earlier.

1018
00:42:46,170 --> 00:42:47,070
Because I'm...

1019
00:42:47,490 --> 00:42:47,990
Look you see?

1020
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:49,670
It's gonna miss.

1021
00:42:51,810 --> 00:42:52,790
So like yeah.

1022
00:42:52,850 --> 00:42:54,250
Right here your heavy SPD.

1023
00:42:54,470 --> 00:42:55,130
If you press special move.

1024
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:56,430
It will not grab me.

1025
00:42:56,550 --> 00:42:56,930
Okay.

1026
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:02,290
Yeah there you go.

1027
00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:02,930
Oh I'm doing it.

1028
00:43:04,050 --> 00:43:04,850
There you go.

1029
00:43:05,410 --> 00:43:08,110
Alright so now I want you to practice that on the right side.

1030
00:43:11,570 --> 00:43:15,130
I think I'm just a prodigy at this point.

1031
00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:18,150
Oh first try right there.

1032
00:43:18,150 --> 00:43:18,850
First try.

1033
00:43:18,890 --> 00:43:20,650
First try on this side.

1034
00:43:20,770 --> 00:43:23,370
I told you I'm so bad at...

1035
00:43:23,370 --> 00:43:24,270
Alright.

1036
00:43:25,230 --> 00:43:26,850
What do you do if I...

1037
00:43:26,850 --> 00:43:29,490
If you do drive impact to me when I'm in the corner?

1038
00:43:29,790 --> 00:43:30,690
Drive impact?

1039
00:43:30,910 --> 00:43:31,610
I'm in the corner.

1040
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:34,530
Yeah what do you do here?

1041
00:43:34,770 --> 00:43:36,430
Oh I could do that or...

1042
00:43:36,430 --> 00:43:38,350
Was it this and then...

1043
00:43:39,030 --> 00:43:39,590
Sorry.

1044
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:42,450
And then oh no.

1045
00:43:42,630 --> 00:43:44,310
It was like this.

1046
00:43:45,530 --> 00:43:46,670
Oh you want this?

1047
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:47,790
Yeah.

1048
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:52,210
So what you could do.

1049
00:43:53,410 --> 00:43:55,130
If it's easier for you.

1050
00:43:55,270 --> 00:43:55,810
Yeah.

1051
00:43:55,970 --> 00:43:57,410
Just mash, auto, medium.

1052
00:43:57,890 --> 00:43:59,990
Hold the assist and press medium, medium.

1053
00:44:00,310 --> 00:44:01,270
Oh okay.

1054
00:44:02,850 --> 00:44:05,390
Yeah so do that when I'm...

1055
00:44:05,390 --> 00:44:06,950
When you drive impact me in the corner.

1056
00:44:07,210 --> 00:44:08,070
Oh whoops sorry.

1057
00:44:09,950 --> 00:44:10,490
Okay.

1058
00:44:15,130 --> 00:44:16,050
Oh I see.

1059
00:44:16,890 --> 00:44:18,210
No so don't...

1060
00:44:18,210 --> 00:44:20,510
Just press it two times.

1061
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:21,510
Press it two times.

1062
00:44:21,770 --> 00:44:22,010
Okay.

1063
00:44:26,450 --> 00:44:28,150
Yeah so you could do that.

1064
00:44:28,330 --> 00:44:30,590
And right after that when I get up.

1065
00:44:30,690 --> 00:44:32,010
Go for heavy...

1066
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:33,830
Go for the special move grab.

1067
00:44:34,090 --> 00:44:35,170
Special move grab?

1068
00:44:35,370 --> 00:44:37,230
Yeah just press special.

1069
00:44:37,350 --> 00:44:37,630
Okay.

1070
00:44:41,590 --> 00:44:42,670
Oh whoops.

1071
00:44:43,210 --> 00:44:43,830
Oh yeah.

1072
00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:44,970
Don't mash.

1073
00:44:46,670 --> 00:44:47,590
Two times.

1074
00:44:49,870 --> 00:44:50,330
No.

1075
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:53,670
There you go.

1076
00:44:54,930 --> 00:44:56,530
And then wait for me to get up.

1077
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:56,930
Okay.

1078
00:44:57,430 --> 00:44:58,850
And then you just grab right away.

1079
00:45:00,290 --> 00:45:00,750
Okay.

1080
00:45:02,310 --> 00:45:03,670
Almost, almost, almost.

1081
00:45:03,850 --> 00:45:04,190
Don't worry.

1082
00:45:06,950 --> 00:45:07,630
Get up.

1083
00:45:08,650 --> 00:45:09,110
Hahaha.

1084
00:45:11,650 --> 00:45:12,210
Alright.

1085
00:45:15,470 --> 00:45:16,810
Alright get up.

1086
00:45:17,010 --> 00:45:18,790
Alright I just say that to myself.

1087
00:45:19,370 --> 00:45:20,530
Yeah that's a good timing.

1088
00:45:20,530 --> 00:45:20,610
Hahaha.

1089
00:45:21,710 --> 00:45:23,170
Yeah that's a good timing.

1090
00:45:25,010 --> 00:45:25,790
Get up.

1091
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:27,450
Hahaha.

1092
00:45:29,530 --> 00:45:30,090
You...

1093
00:45:30,890 --> 00:45:32,450
So instead of saying get up.

1094
00:45:32,530 --> 00:45:32,950
Yeah.

1095
00:45:34,010 --> 00:45:37,770
Like obviously do that because the timing when you say it's very good.

1096
00:45:37,890 --> 00:45:38,230
Yeah.

1097
00:45:39,290 --> 00:45:39,890
So instead of saying get up.

1098
00:45:39,890 --> 00:45:42,850
Replace get up with drive impact again.

1099
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:44,890
Drive impact again.

1100
00:45:45,050 --> 00:45:45,490
Okay.

1101
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:46,050
Yeah.

1102
00:45:46,090 --> 00:45:47,070
Okay okay.

1103
00:45:49,990 --> 00:45:52,210
Drive impact again.

1104
00:45:52,510 --> 00:45:53,110
Hahaha.

1105
00:45:53,310 --> 00:45:54,510
No no I mean like.

1106
00:45:54,590 --> 00:45:56,410
So when I mean drive impact again.

1107
00:45:56,470 --> 00:45:57,590
Do drive impact again.

1108
00:45:57,730 --> 00:45:58,070
Hahaha.

1109
00:45:58,510 --> 00:46:00,050
I was like wait.

1110
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:02,530
Okay you want me to say that.

1111
00:46:02,530 --> 00:46:03,510
That's the get up.

1112
00:46:03,590 --> 00:46:04,290
That's the way.

1113
00:46:04,790 --> 00:46:05,430
Hahaha.

1114
00:46:08,270 --> 00:46:09,070
Get up.

1115
00:46:09,230 --> 00:46:09,850
Hahaha.

1116
00:46:10,070 --> 00:46:12,310
Do a little bit faster.

1117
00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:15,110
Let me show you what.

1118
00:46:15,150 --> 00:46:15,650
Hahaha.

1119
00:46:16,550 --> 00:46:16,830
Haha.

1120
00:46:20,350 --> 00:46:21,630
I see.

1121
00:46:22,170 --> 00:46:24,570
Oh so you can like spam it.

1122
00:46:24,710 --> 00:46:25,730
Until you are tired.

1123
00:46:26,310 --> 00:46:27,550
Yeah until you are tired.

1124
00:46:27,930 --> 00:46:29,990
But obviously they can react.

1125
00:46:29,990 --> 00:46:31,230
We are back with Drive Impact back.

1126
00:46:31,510 --> 00:46:33,830
But they have to be quick with it.

1127
00:46:33,990 --> 00:46:34,290
Okay.

1128
00:46:37,330 --> 00:46:42,490
Remember how I mentioned to you earlier that I want something to always be heads or tails?

1129
00:46:42,770 --> 00:46:42,990
Yeah.

1130
00:46:43,590 --> 00:46:46,890
So think of this as another situation with heads or tails.

1131
00:46:47,270 --> 00:46:58,190
Where you do Drive Impact, do the combo, and then you can do Drive Impact again, keep doing it, and then I'll say this time they go for the Drive Impact back, you go for the throw.

1132
00:46:58,190 --> 00:46:59,450
Oh, I see.

1133
00:46:59,910 --> 00:47:00,650
I see.

1134
00:47:00,930 --> 00:47:01,070
Yeah, yeah.

1135
00:47:01,450 --> 00:47:01,950
Okay.

1136
00:47:02,830 --> 00:47:03,330
Alright.

1137
00:47:03,550 --> 00:47:04,430
I understand.

1138
00:47:06,450 --> 00:47:07,430
Alright, get up.

1139
00:47:11,290 --> 00:47:11,790
No!

1140
00:47:11,990 --> 00:47:13,330
I didn't say get up!

1141
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:15,850
You didn't say it!

1142
00:47:15,910 --> 00:47:16,190
I didn't say it!

1143
00:47:16,190 --> 00:47:17,090
You forgot to say clap!

1144
00:47:17,650 --> 00:47:18,150
Okay.

1145
00:47:19,330 --> 00:47:20,170
Oh shit.

1146
00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:20,550
Whoops.

1147
00:47:23,050 --> 00:47:23,550
Alright.

1148
00:47:23,690 --> 00:47:24,470
I got this.

1149
00:47:28,190 --> 00:47:28,490
Get up.

1150
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:32,490
Get up.

1151
00:47:34,470 --> 00:47:34,830
Yeah.

1152
00:47:34,830 --> 00:47:41,070
So the only thing I would say is that you need to do the Drive Impact, the second one, a little bit faster.

1153
00:47:41,130 --> 00:47:42,010
A little bit faster, yeah.

1154
00:47:42,030 --> 00:47:42,190
Okay.

1155
00:47:42,470 --> 00:47:42,830
Yeah.

1156
00:47:42,910 --> 00:47:44,410
So I'll tell you when and you press it.

1157
00:47:44,530 --> 00:47:45,050
Okay, okay.

1158
00:47:45,770 --> 00:47:46,670
Yep, go for it.

1159
00:47:49,670 --> 00:47:50,250
Press it.

1160
00:47:53,510 --> 00:47:53,870
Goodbye.

1161
00:47:55,950 --> 00:47:56,830
Yeah, don't do that.

1162
00:47:56,950 --> 00:47:57,770
That is a goodbye.

1163
00:47:58,190 --> 00:47:58,630
Yeah.

1164
00:47:58,870 --> 00:47:59,810
Try again.

1165
00:48:03,310 --> 00:48:04,030
Press it.

1166
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:05,510
Yeah.

1167
00:48:05,590 --> 00:48:05,930
Yeah.

1168
00:48:07,550 --> 00:48:08,010
Grab.

1169
00:48:08,190 --> 00:48:08,610
No!

1170
00:48:09,150 --> 00:48:09,610
Almost.

1171
00:48:09,990 --> 00:48:10,450
Almost.

1172
00:48:11,130 --> 00:48:14,790
But I feel like you understand Yeah.

1173
00:48:14,790 --> 00:48:16,510
what the situation is, right?

1174
00:48:16,550 --> 00:48:17,370
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1175
00:48:17,450 --> 00:48:20,350
So now I want you to see Yeah.

1176
00:48:22,050 --> 00:48:23,890
Do the same thing.

1177
00:48:23,970 --> 00:48:24,430
Drive Impact.

1178
00:48:24,590 --> 00:48:25,430
Go for the combo.

1179
00:48:25,590 --> 00:48:29,030
And this time I'm going to think you're going to Drive Impact me.

1180
00:48:29,350 --> 00:48:34,210
So I'm going to Drive Impact on my wake up, but I want you to grab instead.

1181
00:48:34,590 --> 00:48:34,970
Okay.

1182
00:48:35,310 --> 00:48:35,750
Okay.

1183
00:48:35,870 --> 00:48:36,070
Yeah.

1184
00:48:36,090 --> 00:48:36,770
I got this.

1185
00:48:37,210 --> 00:48:37,650
Yeah.

1186
00:48:42,770 --> 00:48:43,210
Yeah!

1187
00:48:43,210 --> 00:48:43,830
You see?

1188
00:48:43,930 --> 00:48:45,230
So you beat my Drive Impact.

1189
00:48:45,310 --> 00:48:45,490
Yeah.

1190
00:48:45,990 --> 00:48:46,670
I did.

1191
00:48:46,830 --> 00:48:47,090
Right?

1192
00:48:48,230 --> 00:48:48,890
I did.

1193
00:48:48,910 --> 00:48:49,710
So that's...

1194
00:48:49,710 --> 00:48:58,830
Yeah, so that's going to... I feel like if you can do those type of sequences, like the one we just did there, this one, right?

1195
00:48:58,910 --> 00:48:59,610
And go into that.

1196
00:49:00,550 --> 00:49:03,930
That would just give you more like layers for offense.

1197
00:49:04,190 --> 00:49:10,770
Because like when I watched your matches, like you normally kind of just go for like this move all day.

1198
00:49:12,010 --> 00:49:12,890
My favorite!

1199
00:49:12,970 --> 00:49:14,310
This is your move.

1200
00:49:15,570 --> 00:49:17,050
It's my knowledge check!

1201
00:49:17,430 --> 00:49:18,130
It is.

1202
00:49:18,210 --> 00:49:18,450
It is.

1203
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:23,230
So think of this like, let's say think of this when you're doing this.

1204
00:49:23,410 --> 00:49:24,990
You can also do it from this way.

1205
00:49:25,270 --> 00:49:25,710
Yeah.

1206
00:49:25,710 --> 00:49:29,950
You can do it from the jump in button that you like to use.

1207
00:49:31,030 --> 00:49:31,610
Okay.

1208
00:49:32,350 --> 00:49:32,930
Alright.

1209
00:49:34,530 --> 00:49:35,110
Oops.

1210
00:49:39,230 --> 00:49:39,810
Alright.

1211
00:49:39,890 --> 00:49:40,450
Yeah, one jab.

1212
00:49:42,410 --> 00:49:42,990
Okay.

1213
00:49:45,350 --> 00:49:45,930
Oops.

1214
00:49:46,570 --> 00:49:47,370
You're okay.

1215
00:49:47,590 --> 00:49:47,990
You're okay.

1216
00:49:49,610 --> 00:49:51,890
You say lag?

1217
00:49:52,210 --> 00:49:53,490
I lagged there mentally.

1218
00:49:53,930 --> 00:49:54,510
Oh, okay.

1219
00:49:55,750 --> 00:49:56,190
Nice.

1220
00:49:57,810 --> 00:50:00,570
See, you could do more of it in the corner, obviously.

1221
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:00,970
Yeah.

1222
00:50:03,390 --> 00:50:04,890
So that's gonna be really good.

1223
00:50:06,650 --> 00:50:07,090
Now...

1224
00:50:07,090 --> 00:50:07,670
Alright.

1225
00:50:08,170 --> 00:50:09,410
Do you know how to drive rush?

1226
00:50:10,050 --> 00:50:10,770
Drive rush?

1227
00:50:10,910 --> 00:50:11,090
Yeah.

1228
00:50:11,730 --> 00:50:12,490
Is that right?

1229
00:50:12,750 --> 00:50:13,010
Yeah.

1230
00:50:13,490 --> 00:50:14,770
Do you know how to do...

1231
00:50:14,770 --> 00:50:17,530
I know you like to do this.

1232
00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:18,210
Hold on.

1233
00:50:18,330 --> 00:50:18,510
Oops.

1234
00:50:18,650 --> 00:50:19,190
Wrong button.

1235
00:50:19,590 --> 00:50:20,030
This.

1236
00:50:20,270 --> 00:50:20,710
That.

1237
00:50:20,990 --> 00:50:24,490
So I want you to do drive rush into that.

1238
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:25,170
Ooh.

1239
00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:25,270
Ooh.

1240
00:50:25,710 --> 00:50:28,830
Because look, from here, it goes really far.

1241
00:50:29,010 --> 00:50:29,230
Yeah.

1242
00:50:30,350 --> 00:50:33,250
But that's really good to use as well.

1243
00:50:34,650 --> 00:50:35,130
That?

1244
00:50:35,290 --> 00:50:35,490
Okay.

1245
00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:39,070
So do it as early as possible because the momentum will carry you.

1246
00:50:39,190 --> 00:50:39,470
Okay.

1247
00:50:40,170 --> 00:50:41,010
Yeah, I like that.

1248
00:50:42,290 --> 00:50:43,150
Yeah, you see?

1249
00:50:45,630 --> 00:50:47,410
Yeah, it will just carry you.

1250
00:50:47,730 --> 00:50:48,210
Ooh.

1251
00:50:49,430 --> 00:50:52,490
And you can also do this as well too.

1252
00:50:52,630 --> 00:50:55,070
Like you do drive rush or charge it.

1253
00:50:56,010 --> 00:50:56,490
Ooh.

1254
00:50:56,750 --> 00:50:57,650
Sorry, that's my dog.

1255
00:50:57,930 --> 00:50:58,690
Yeah, you're fine.

1256
00:50:58,830 --> 00:50:59,310
Yeah.

1257
00:51:01,550 --> 00:51:02,930
Oh, like, yeah, just charge it.

1258
00:51:04,990 --> 00:51:05,890
Yeah, like that.

1259
00:51:05,970 --> 00:51:06,130
Alright.

1260
00:51:06,210 --> 00:51:09,370
Because let's say somebody tries to attack you when you turn green.

1261
00:51:09,530 --> 00:51:09,930
Yeah.

1262
00:51:10,630 --> 00:51:12,230
Like, this will happen.

1263
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:14,170
Oh, yeah.

1264
00:51:14,210 --> 00:51:15,530
Like, do it to me.

1265
00:51:16,290 --> 00:51:17,270
Oh, nice.

1266
00:51:17,810 --> 00:51:18,290
Yeah.

1267
00:51:19,730 --> 00:51:20,210
Whoa!

1268
00:51:21,590 --> 00:51:22,070
Yep.

1269
00:51:23,710 --> 00:51:24,190
Yep.

1270
00:51:24,190 --> 00:51:24,430
Okay.

1271
00:51:24,950 --> 00:51:25,590
You see?

1272
00:51:25,710 --> 00:51:26,590
So that's really good.

1273
00:51:26,670 --> 00:51:26,970
Yeah.

1274
00:51:27,130 --> 00:51:31,170
So now let's say you think they're going to block it.

1275
00:51:31,650 --> 00:51:34,310
Like, block this button or block this button.

1276
00:51:34,730 --> 00:51:38,490
Then you change it up with drive rush that one.

1277
00:51:38,850 --> 00:51:39,330
Okay.

1278
00:51:39,890 --> 00:51:41,590
Because that's your low option.

1279
00:51:43,450 --> 00:51:43,930
Yep.

1280
00:51:47,810 --> 00:51:48,290
Yep.

1281
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:55,570
So think of that as like this like this into this or into this.

1282
00:51:55,750 --> 00:51:57,130
That's like your rock, paper, scissors.

1283
00:51:57,370 --> 00:51:57,730
Okay.

1284
00:51:59,090 --> 00:52:00,970
I'm going to see if I can remember all that.

1285
00:52:01,550 --> 00:52:02,230
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1286
00:52:05,410 --> 00:52:06,710
It's all heavy buttons.

1287
00:52:06,910 --> 00:52:08,390
It's always the heavy buttons.

1288
00:52:08,510 --> 00:52:08,690
Yeah.

1289
00:52:08,690 --> 00:52:09,770
Don't press any other buttons.

1290
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:13,550
Yep.

1291
00:52:14,450 --> 00:52:14,870
Oops.

1292
00:52:14,870 --> 00:52:15,290
Oops.

1293
00:52:20,990 --> 00:52:21,510
Yep.

1294
00:52:22,150 --> 00:52:24,190
You just choose between that three.

1295
00:52:24,270 --> 00:52:29,450
Because your goal is to get them like knocked down close to the corner as possible.

1296
00:52:29,450 --> 00:52:29,890
Yeah.

1297
00:52:30,130 --> 00:52:30,270
Right?

1298
00:52:30,910 --> 00:52:35,150
Because then you can go for the drive impact thing that I showed you.

1299
00:52:36,430 --> 00:52:40,990
So, do you know how to do press a button into drive rush?

1300
00:52:41,470 --> 00:52:43,410
Press a button into drive rush?

1301
00:52:43,970 --> 00:52:44,590
Like this.

1302
00:52:46,150 --> 00:52:46,750
What?

1303
00:52:47,790 --> 00:52:50,030
How did you do that?

1304
00:52:50,130 --> 00:52:51,630
Press standing light kick.

1305
00:52:51,810 --> 00:52:52,910
Standing light attack.

1306
00:52:53,230 --> 00:52:54,710
Oh, okay.

1307
00:52:54,950 --> 00:52:55,430
Hit that button.

1308
00:52:55,590 --> 00:52:55,890
Yeah.

1309
00:52:56,370 --> 00:52:59,290
And then you tap forward, forward.

1310
00:53:00,610 --> 00:53:01,210
What?

1311
00:53:01,630 --> 00:53:02,530
That's a move?

1312
00:53:04,250 --> 00:53:09,170
Or you can press parry button right away.

1313
00:53:09,210 --> 00:53:10,690
The parry button will do it automatically.

1314
00:53:11,330 --> 00:53:12,610
Oh my god.

1315
00:53:12,890 --> 00:53:14,410
I could've been doing that?

1316
00:53:14,550 --> 00:53:14,850
Yeah.

1317
00:53:15,770 --> 00:53:18,350
It's very That's what I want you to do, actually.

1318
00:53:18,470 --> 00:53:19,310
That's the perfect thing.

1319
00:53:19,650 --> 00:53:22,450
I want you literally to do this.

1320
00:53:22,550 --> 00:53:26,630
If you can do this, this will help your chances so much more.

1321
00:53:27,150 --> 00:53:28,030
Oh my god.

1322
00:53:28,070 --> 00:53:28,510
Exactly.

1323
00:53:29,050 --> 00:53:31,070
That is literally how you get free grabs.

1324
00:53:31,350 --> 00:53:31,450
I could've been doing this.

1325
00:53:32,310 --> 00:53:32,750
Yes.

1326
00:53:32,810 --> 00:53:33,370
I'm glad.

1327
00:53:33,450 --> 00:53:34,430
I didn't have to tell you.

1328
00:53:34,490 --> 00:53:36,730
You already knew what you needed to do.

1329
00:53:37,190 --> 00:53:38,070
Oh my god.

1330
00:53:39,170 --> 00:53:43,410
The only bad part about this is that you can only do it two times.

1331
00:53:44,110 --> 00:53:47,670
Because you'll get tired after two times.

1332
00:53:48,210 --> 00:53:48,690
Okay.

1333
00:53:49,250 --> 00:53:50,530
So you just have to be careful.

1334
00:53:51,690 --> 00:53:52,170
Alright.

1335
00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:54,390
Actually, you can do it three times if you think about it.

1336
00:53:54,730 --> 00:53:56,410
Yeah, they'd be dead by then, right?

1337
00:53:57,430 --> 00:53:58,610
Almost, almost dead.

1338
00:53:58,810 --> 00:54:00,090
Yeah, almost dead.

1339
00:54:01,190 --> 00:54:04,770
Yeah, because you can even do like if you're feeling funky with it.

1340
00:54:05,770 --> 00:54:06,250
Right?

1341
00:54:06,350 --> 00:54:07,630
You can even do this.

1342
00:54:09,770 --> 00:54:10,250
Oh!

1343
00:54:10,870 --> 00:54:11,670
Level three.

1344
00:54:12,170 --> 00:54:12,650
Yeah.

1345
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:19,740
So you could do that as well.

1346
00:54:20,620 --> 00:54:21,520
Oh, I see.

1347
00:54:22,340 --> 00:54:22,840
Yeah, yeah.

1348
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:23,860
So you could try it.

1349
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:25,180
Okay.

1350
00:54:26,420 --> 00:54:27,100
Oh, whoops.

1351
00:54:28,660 --> 00:54:29,020
Okay.

1352
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:32,360
Yup.

1353
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:34,040
Oh my god.

1354
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:34,800
He won't expect it.

1355
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:36,100
Yup.

1356
00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:42,040
So, so, so.

1357
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:45,060
But like literally if you could just get this down like...

1358
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:46,720
10 out of 10.

1359
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:48,060
Every single time.

1360
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:52,100
This will help you get so many more options of grabs.

1361
00:54:52,420 --> 00:54:53,420
Oh, I see.

1362
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:55,400
Oh my god.

1363
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:57,420
This is gonna be my new favorite move.

1364
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:58,500
Yeah.

1365
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:04,260
Even at the highest level, this, like, that works.

1366
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:06,680
Oh my god.

1367
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:08,560
Yeah, don't press down.

1368
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:10,960
It's so easy now.

1369
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:12,680
It is very easy.

1370
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:13,400
Oops.

1371
00:55:18,260 --> 00:55:18,860
All right.

1372
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:21,600
Yeah, you can also do this as well too.

1373
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:23,980
Let's say you're like from really far.

1374
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:30,720
You could drive rush into the back, into the into the back throw.

1375
00:55:31,060 --> 00:55:31,500
Yeah.

1376
00:55:31,540 --> 00:55:31,980
Like this.

1377
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:39,000
Cause you know how like, do you know like from here it's fast, from here it's slow.

1378
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:40,160
Uh huh.

1379
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:41,420
Yeah, yeah.

1380
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:43,980
Like he like lifts his hands up.

1381
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:44,360
Yeah.

1382
00:55:47,660 --> 00:55:50,640
And you, let's say, you see this line right here I'm stepping on?

1383
00:55:50,740 --> 00:55:51,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1384
00:55:51,820 --> 00:55:53,600
So if I drive rush to the line.

1385
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:59,460
You see how it looks like it was I was still running, but I go into a throw.

1386
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:00,200
Yeah.

1387
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:03,780
So that can really catch people off guard.

1388
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:06,400
Okay.

1389
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:07,440
Yeah.

1390
00:56:08,460 --> 00:56:09,280
Yep, exactly.

1391
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:11,380
Oh, I see.

1392
00:56:13,060 --> 00:56:13,460
Yep.

1393
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:19,260
All right.

1394
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:20,160
Yeah.

1395
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:23,540
So that could be a thing as well too.

1396
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:25,840
If you want to keep going for more throws, right?

1397
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:26,540
Uh huh.

1398
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:30,680
And let's see, I like the fact that you do this move a lot.

1399
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:33,020
I saw you like air one.

1400
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:33,680
Yeah, this.

1401
00:56:34,420 --> 00:56:34,820
Yeah.

1402
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:38,240
So if somebody jumps at you, what do you do?

1403
00:56:38,740 --> 00:56:38,860
Yeah.

1404
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:41,040
Oh, this one jumps?

1405
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:41,360
This?

1406
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:42,440
Yeah.

1407
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:44,860
Okay.

1408
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:45,260
Nice.

1409
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:46,020
All right, all right.

1410
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:54,660
You can also you can also, let's say let's say if you it's too late to do this move, because sometimes it's a little bit too late to do it.

1411
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:56,760
Oops, sorry.

1412
00:56:58,360 --> 00:56:59,440
Let's go for parry.

1413
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:00,660
Parry, okay.

1414
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:01,700
Yeah.

1415
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:03,620
Yes.

1416
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:05,800
Have you tried to do perfect parry before?

1417
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:08,400
Um, yes and no.

1418
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:10,480
Sometimes it happens.

1419
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:12,100
Like it happens, right?

1420
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:12,880
Yeah, like this.

1421
00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:17,060
So what do you do when you get that perfect parry?

1422
00:57:17,060 --> 00:57:18,040
I don't know.

1423
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:23,020
Just press press the special move button right away.

1424
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:23,360
Okay.

1425
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:24,340
Okay.

1426
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:25,560
Oh, no.

1427
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:27,240
No.

1428
00:57:27,940 --> 00:57:28,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1429
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:34,120
So only do it when you get perfect parry.

1430
00:57:34,620 --> 00:57:36,260
Okay, this is going to take a while.

1431
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:38,660
I'm just kidding.

1432
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:41,180
I'm trying to time it to your hit.

1433
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:44,820
But my hit is random.

1434
00:57:45,740 --> 00:57:46,180
Okay.

1435
00:57:48,060 --> 00:57:48,760
Oh, nice.

1436
00:57:48,820 --> 00:57:49,480
You did it.

1437
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:51,920
Teamwork.

1438
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:53,240
Yeah.

1439
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:56,120
So that's also really good.

1440
00:57:56,460 --> 00:57:58,240
But let's say if you're in the corner.

1441
00:57:58,400 --> 00:57:58,680
Yeah.

1442
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:03,960
So I'm going to knock you down like this and I want you to wake up with parry.

1443
00:58:04,060 --> 00:58:04,820
Oh, wake up with parry.

1444
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:05,180
Oh, okay.

1445
00:58:05,340 --> 00:58:06,060
Wake up with parry.

1446
00:58:06,060 --> 00:58:06,300
Okay.

1447
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:09,280
Oh!

1448
00:58:10,140 --> 00:58:10,840
Oh, I'm sorry.

1449
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:16,060
So when that happens, I want you to back throw me.

1450
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:20,120
Okay.

1451
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:27,400
Try again.

1452
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:30,580
Not the special back throw.

1453
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:31,560
The regular back throw.

1454
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:33,200
Like this one.

1455
00:58:33,540 --> 00:58:34,320
Oh, okay.

1456
00:58:34,460 --> 00:58:34,920
The regular.

1457
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:35,360
Okay.

1458
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:37,880
Oh, whoops.

1459
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:39,040
Yeah, yeah.

1460
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:39,760
Try again.

1461
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:42,820
Yeah, it has to be perfect parry.

1462
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:44,340
If it's regular parry, don't go for that.

1463
00:58:44,540 --> 00:58:44,840
Okay.

1464
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:45,020
Alright.

1465
00:58:48,820 --> 00:58:49,460
Don't worry.

1466
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:50,340
Eventually it will happen.

1467
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:54,260
It looks so cool on stream when it does happen, right?

1468
00:58:54,620 --> 00:58:55,340
It does.

1469
00:58:55,540 --> 00:58:56,660
It looks so cool.

1470
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:01,500
It'll happen, guys.

1471
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:04,660
On one of the round robins, it's going to happen.

1472
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:10,200
Because this is your best defense.

1473
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:11,340
Yeah, okay.

1474
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:11,720
Okay.

1475
00:59:11,940 --> 00:59:15,060
So you should always wake up with it.

1476
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:15,840
Okay.

1477
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:17,480
Anytime.

1478
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:18,940
Don't worry.

1479
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:24,180
Oh my god.

1480
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:25,440
No, I fucking...

1481
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:27,980
You didn't expect it.

1482
00:59:28,220 --> 00:59:30,020
I didn't expect it at all.

1483
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:30,840
Okay, okay, okay.

1484
00:59:31,420 --> 00:59:33,560
This time you were expecting it.

1485
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:34,120
Yeah, yeah.

1486
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:35,280
This time.

1487
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:37,220
Okay.

1488
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:40,320
There you go.

1489
00:59:40,380 --> 00:59:41,100
There you go.

1490
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:42,480
No, wrong throw.

1491
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:42,920
No!

1492
00:59:44,780 --> 00:59:46,460
We can do this.

1493
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:52,440
Oh my god.

1494
00:59:53,900 --> 00:59:55,720
But it looks so cool, guys.

1495
00:59:56,620 --> 00:59:57,180
Back.

1496
00:59:58,800 --> 00:59:59,140
Back.

1497
01:00:00,980 --> 01:00:01,800
It's okay.

1498
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:02,160
It's okay.

1499
01:00:04,940 --> 01:00:07,100
I'm just practicing the perfect parry.

1500
01:00:07,100 --> 01:00:08,560
That's really it.

1501
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:09,660
Back throw, back throw.

1502
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:12,000
Okay, we did it!

1503
01:00:13,140 --> 01:00:16,160
Now, after the back throw.

1504
01:00:16,340 --> 01:00:16,780
Yeah.

1505
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:20,380
You do the ODSPD right away.

1506
01:00:20,660 --> 01:00:21,220
Okay.

1507
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:23,560
Because it'll look like this.

1508
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:23,920
Watch.

1509
01:00:24,540 --> 01:00:26,180
So if I do it.

1510
01:00:26,340 --> 01:00:27,320
You get up.

1511
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:29,000
Whoa!

1512
01:00:31,860 --> 01:00:33,020
That's a lot of damage.

1513
01:00:33,540 --> 01:00:35,180
Yeah, so try that.

1514
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:36,320
Okay.

1515
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:37,560
You got it.

1516
01:00:38,020 --> 01:00:39,620
When did we get there?

1517
01:00:45,140 --> 01:00:45,840
Oh, god.

1518
01:00:55,120 --> 01:00:55,940
Oh, I see.

1519
01:00:56,100 --> 01:01:01,040
Also, when you're going for the parries, make sure you're holding down back at the same time.

1520
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:01,900
Oh, okay.

1521
01:01:02,620 --> 01:01:03,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1522
01:01:04,380 --> 01:01:06,280
So if you mess up the parry, you'll be...

1523
01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:07,360
blocked.

1524
01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:09,580
Okay.

1525
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:12,200
Oh, god.

1526
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:14,660
Oh, my god.

1527
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:15,260
Back throw?

1528
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:16,440
That's okay.

1529
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:17,720
ODSPD?

1530
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:18,160
ODSPD?

1531
01:01:18,380 --> 01:01:18,940
We did it!

1532
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:23,740
Guys, I'm totally gonna do this stream.

1533
01:01:26,260 --> 01:01:27,000
It's gonna work.

1534
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:27,680
You know what it is?

1535
01:01:27,820 --> 01:01:28,720
If you...

1536
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:32,560
So the hard part about it is obviously like all the stuff that we're...

1537
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:34,960
I'm showing you, it's like remembering it, right?

1538
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:35,620
Yeah, yeah.

1539
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:39,420
I'll be surprised if I retain 50% of this after.

1540
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:50,060
So think of it like this, it's like when you go, when you play your matches like online, like when you're practicing, think about, okay, I wanna land this one thing that I learned.

1541
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:51,700
I wanna land this other thing.

1542
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:53,240
Don't think about winning the match.

1543
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:57,360
Think about like, okay, I'm going to do this.

1544
01:01:58,420 --> 01:02:01,840
And if you land that, then think of that as the win.

1545
01:02:03,140 --> 01:02:03,580
Okay.

1546
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:05,240
Yeah.

1547
01:02:08,140 --> 01:02:09,340
What was that?

1548
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:09,740
What happened?

1549
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:11,820
I think we're still in.

1550
01:02:11,820 --> 01:02:12,640
Wait, you left the room.

1551
01:02:13,220 --> 01:02:14,300
Where did you go?

1552
01:02:15,340 --> 01:02:16,460
Are you still in?

1553
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:17,400
Yeah, I'm still in.

1554
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:18,280
Where did you go?

1555
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:20,660
Oh, I got kicked off.

1556
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:25,700
Is this Steam?

1557
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:27,980
Today's Tuesday?

1558
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:30,400
No, it's Monday.

1559
01:02:30,980 --> 01:02:32,020
It's a long weekend.

1560
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:34,340
It is a long weekend.

1561
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:35,480
Yeah, it's Monday.

1562
01:02:36,340 --> 01:02:37,520
Are you playing on PC?

1563
01:02:37,900 --> 01:02:38,340
Yeah.

1564
01:02:40,060 --> 01:02:41,840
Why my game is wrong?

1565
01:02:46,380 --> 01:02:47,920
Why is your game wrong?

1566
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:49,600
Why is your game wrong?

1567
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:53,980
It's saying I can't log in.

1568
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:54,820
What the?

1569
01:02:54,900 --> 01:02:56,080
Did you get hacked?

1570
01:02:56,220 --> 01:02:56,740
Live?

1571
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:58,560
Imagine.

1572
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:02,720
Justin Wong gets hacked live on stream.

1573
01:03:07,510 --> 01:03:08,090
Let's see.

1574
01:03:08,570 --> 01:03:09,190
Wait, wait.

1575
01:03:09,270 --> 01:03:10,110
I think I'm back in.

1576
01:03:12,330 --> 01:03:13,230
It's like loading.

1577
01:03:13,390 --> 01:03:14,230
It didn't give me the error.

1578
01:03:14,950 --> 01:03:15,930
Yes, we're back in.

1579
01:03:15,930 --> 01:03:15,930
That's weird.

1580
01:03:15,930 --> 01:03:16,510
That's spooky.

1581
01:03:17,190 --> 01:03:18,730
I'll wait for your custom room.

1582
01:03:20,130 --> 01:03:21,270
Capcom wasn't feeling it.

1583
01:03:23,450 --> 01:03:25,650
You used up your modern gif credits.

1584
01:03:26,070 --> 01:03:26,690
I did.

1585
01:03:27,270 --> 01:03:29,330
Ban for Sajam slam collusion.

1586
01:03:31,490 --> 01:03:34,930
If you were going to coach one person, you should coach them all.

1587
01:03:36,350 --> 01:03:37,670
I coached a few people.

1588
01:03:38,430 --> 01:03:39,690
Wait, who else did you coach?

1589
01:03:42,830 --> 01:03:43,230
Amore.

1590
01:03:43,310 --> 01:03:44,670
Oh, yeah.

1591
01:03:47,350 --> 01:03:47,750
Boxbox.

1592
01:03:47,830 --> 01:03:51,050
We had a thing this past weekend at PAX.

1593
01:03:52,750 --> 01:03:54,450
I had to coach him as well too.

1594
01:03:54,850 --> 01:03:56,350
I know Sfan hit me up.

1595
01:03:56,470 --> 01:03:58,250
So I got to talk to him as well.

1596
01:03:59,570 --> 01:04:03,470
As long as none of them are in my division, that's fine with me.

1597
01:04:03,910 --> 01:04:05,950
Who's in your division?

1598
01:04:06,330 --> 01:04:06,790
Wait, wait.

1599
01:04:07,210 --> 01:04:11,350
If I bribe you, can you not coach me?

1600
01:04:13,090 --> 01:04:15,470
My division is...

1601
01:04:15,470 --> 01:04:18,610
That sounds like a corrupt coach.

1602
01:04:20,310 --> 01:04:33,490
I mean, if you want a modern gif to win the beginner division and to represent all modern gifs out there, I feel like it's in your favor to not let them beat me.

1603
01:04:35,350 --> 01:04:36,130
Oh, okay.

1604
01:04:36,270 --> 01:04:39,790
So are you the Division 1?

1605
01:04:39,930 --> 01:04:40,790
I'm the beginner.

1606
01:04:42,630 --> 01:04:45,010
I am the very, very beginner.

1607
01:04:48,130 --> 01:04:51,290
Silver is pretty good for that first level.

1608
01:04:52,230 --> 01:04:52,910
Is it?

1609
01:04:53,110 --> 01:04:58,170
I was expecting maybe Iron and Bronze to be the first level, but Silver is pretty good.

1610
01:04:59,010 --> 01:05:01,670
I'm pretty sure a lot of the beginners are already in Silver.

1611
01:05:02,470 --> 01:05:03,170
Oh, maybe.

1612
01:05:03,910 --> 01:05:09,410
But if you learn everything that I showed you, you can get to Gold at least.

1613
01:05:09,670 --> 01:05:10,110
Oh.

1614
01:05:11,210 --> 01:05:12,770
Okay, I'll try my best.

1615
01:05:13,690 --> 01:05:14,990
Did you get my invite?

1616
01:05:15,370 --> 01:05:16,270
Let me check.

1617
01:05:17,990 --> 01:05:18,770
I did.

1618
01:05:18,870 --> 01:05:19,570
Yeah, I'm coming in.

1619
01:05:22,130 --> 01:05:25,610
Maybe by the end of the day I'll be close to Gold.

1620
01:05:25,970 --> 01:05:28,490
Okay, you're fighting against Blanka, right?

1621
01:05:28,610 --> 01:05:34,330
I'm fighting against Blanka, Bison, Lily, Cammy, and Aki.

1622
01:05:35,730 --> 01:05:36,170
Okay.

1623
01:05:36,690 --> 01:05:41,130
So I'm gonna show you probably what moves they're probably gonna be spamming.

1624
01:05:42,070 --> 01:05:44,430
And what you can do against them.

1625
01:05:44,690 --> 01:05:44,950
Okay.

1626
01:05:45,870 --> 01:05:46,310
Alright.

1627
01:05:47,490 --> 01:05:49,150
So now, it's probably this move.

1628
01:05:49,150 --> 01:05:49,610
Oh my god, you look like a tomato.

1629
01:05:50,830 --> 01:05:51,750
Oh yeah, that's my color.

1630
01:05:53,010 --> 01:05:54,390
It's probably this move right here.

1631
01:05:54,510 --> 01:05:54,710
Yeah.

1632
01:05:56,470 --> 01:06:03,730
So what you can do is you can press down special when it gets close to you.

1633
01:06:03,910 --> 01:06:04,190
Okay.

1634
01:06:06,870 --> 01:06:07,190
Yep.

1635
01:06:14,740 --> 01:06:18,140
Yeah, so like, that's gonna be the main thing for you to counter.

1636
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:22,280
So if you can do that every time, then he can't do that anymore.

1637
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:24,080
Then they have to have a different game plan, right?

1638
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:24,720
Yeah.

1639
01:06:24,780 --> 01:06:26,880
The other thing they'll do is obviously jump.

1640
01:06:27,300 --> 01:06:29,240
So you gotta be ready, because the jump is super fast.

1641
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:31,880
Yeah, so you just have to be ready with the Lariat.

1642
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:33,720
Okay.

1643
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:35,480
Oh.

1644
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:38,380
Yep.

1645
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:42,040
Another thing is that, can you block low for me?

1646
01:06:43,340 --> 01:06:45,100
Oh yeah, that move.

1647
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:54,040
So if you block, so you can try to tap parry before the electricity hits you.

1648
01:06:58,430 --> 01:06:59,010
Yeah.

1649
01:06:59,150 --> 01:06:59,650
Okay.

1650
01:06:59,790 --> 01:07:03,810
So you can obviously get, if the timing hits, perfect parry.

1651
01:07:06,650 --> 01:07:09,250
But also, yeah, you see, and then you go for the throw.

1652
01:07:09,390 --> 01:07:09,630
Yeah.

1653
01:07:11,970 --> 01:07:25,770
Also, what you can do as well is that if you block it, right, so like block low for me again, you can press you can press a button after that.

1654
01:07:27,870 --> 01:07:29,690
So press like your fastest button.

1655
01:07:30,150 --> 01:07:30,310
Oh.

1656
01:07:30,970 --> 01:07:31,490
Yeah.

1657
01:07:31,630 --> 01:07:33,950
Yeah, like that move.

1658
01:07:34,170 --> 01:07:34,590
Okay.

1659
01:07:37,010 --> 01:07:39,490
Yeah, see, I can't press a button there.

1660
01:07:39,990 --> 01:07:41,990
Oh, you pressed the button.

1661
01:07:42,610 --> 01:07:43,130
Yeah.

1662
01:07:44,190 --> 01:07:45,550
It was a missed time.

1663
01:07:45,750 --> 01:07:46,070
Okay.

1664
01:07:48,570 --> 01:07:55,450
So what you can do here, do two of the crouching lights you did into back special.

1665
01:07:55,930 --> 01:07:56,450
Okay.

1666
01:07:57,130 --> 01:07:57,630
Oops.

1667
01:08:02,610 --> 01:08:06,050
Yeah, so just remember to do that.

1668
01:08:06,250 --> 01:08:06,490
Okay.

1669
01:08:07,570 --> 01:08:08,490
That, okay.

1670
01:08:10,110 --> 01:08:10,610
Or...

1671
01:08:11,210 --> 01:08:12,770
Okay, yeah, what was it?

1672
01:08:14,210 --> 01:08:15,190
You mean this move?

1673
01:08:15,290 --> 01:08:16,210
Yeah, that move.

1674
01:08:16,530 --> 01:08:17,850
You have to block it low.

1675
01:08:18,970 --> 01:08:21,290
Sorry, I got up.

1676
01:08:21,750 --> 01:08:22,370
Yeah, yeah.

1677
01:08:23,350 --> 01:08:26,150
Think of this as the same move as your forward heavy.

1678
01:08:26,450 --> 01:08:26,690
Yeah.

1679
01:08:26,730 --> 01:08:31,810
Where it just, you can literally walk around the park and punish it.

1680
01:08:31,950 --> 01:08:32,430
Okay.

1681
01:08:33,010 --> 01:08:39,310
So if you block it, you do you do the command throw.

1682
01:08:39,410 --> 01:08:40,390
Oh, okay.

1683
01:08:41,930 --> 01:08:43,130
Oh, that's easy.

1684
01:08:44,590 --> 01:08:45,790
It's a punish counter.

1685
01:08:46,550 --> 01:08:48,450
Meaning you do more damage.

1686
01:08:48,610 --> 01:08:49,110
So look, watch.

1687
01:08:50,730 --> 01:08:52,730
See, like if you do the throw regularly.

1688
01:08:53,730 --> 01:08:54,210
Yeah.

1689
01:08:56,690 --> 01:09:00,910
Right, it takes that much, a little bit over the C on my letter, right?

1690
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:01,530
The life.

1691
01:09:01,930 --> 01:09:04,830
But now, watch, block low and then do the command throw.

1692
01:09:06,430 --> 01:09:06,990
You're fine.

1693
01:09:08,510 --> 01:09:09,490
And look at the life.

1694
01:09:11,030 --> 01:09:12,490
It's a bit more.

1695
01:09:12,690 --> 01:09:13,610
Yeah, yeah.

1696
01:09:14,390 --> 01:09:14,830
Right.

1697
01:09:16,750 --> 01:09:19,570
Can you block this again and don't do anything, actually?

1698
01:09:20,050 --> 01:09:21,090
Oh, don't do anything, okay.

1699
01:09:21,450 --> 01:09:23,090
Yeah, I just want to see the number.

1700
01:09:25,490 --> 01:09:26,290
Okay, 18.

1701
01:09:26,470 --> 01:09:28,530
Can you press your auto heavy?

1702
01:09:28,970 --> 01:09:29,590
Auto heavy?

1703
01:09:29,770 --> 01:09:29,950
Okay.

1704
01:09:30,530 --> 01:09:31,170
That's 14.

1705
01:09:31,330 --> 01:09:32,630
Alright, so you can even do that.

1706
01:09:32,750 --> 01:09:36,010
So block low and just do auto heavy target combo.

1707
01:09:37,570 --> 01:09:38,690
Yeah, just do it faster.

1708
01:09:41,010 --> 01:09:41,410
Yeah.

1709
01:09:41,730 --> 01:09:42,550
So that works.

1710
01:09:42,630 --> 01:09:45,530
So if you have level 3, you can combo into it.

1711
01:09:47,030 --> 01:09:47,430
Okay.

1712
01:09:48,210 --> 01:09:48,610
Yeah.

1713
01:09:48,690 --> 01:09:51,210
So that will punish it really hard.

1714
01:09:52,390 --> 01:09:52,930
Let's go!

1715
01:09:54,670 --> 01:09:55,150
Yay!

1716
01:09:56,570 --> 01:09:58,810
So now, you probably see this move.

1717
01:09:59,110 --> 01:10:00,730
Oh yeah, this guy.

1718
01:10:02,330 --> 01:10:03,830
So what would you do against that?

1719
01:10:03,950 --> 01:10:04,190
Jump?

1720
01:10:05,410 --> 01:10:06,770
Just hold parry.

1721
01:10:06,830 --> 01:10:07,510
Oh, okay.

1722
01:10:08,830 --> 01:10:11,230
Because even if I'm coming towards you, you know what I mean?

1723
01:10:12,570 --> 01:10:14,210
So go back, watch.

1724
01:10:15,250 --> 01:10:19,010
And if I activate it, yeah, just hold parry the whole entire time.

1725
01:10:21,350 --> 01:10:23,310
You see, you just parry the attack.

1726
01:10:24,710 --> 01:10:27,090
So the only thing...

1727
01:10:27,750 --> 01:10:28,130
Hold on.

1728
01:10:28,290 --> 01:10:29,490
Let me reset here.

1729
01:10:32,730 --> 01:10:35,350
How does Blanka get his dolls back?

1730
01:10:35,630 --> 01:10:36,370
I don't know.

1731
01:10:38,410 --> 01:10:40,010
Chat, it's time to backseat.

1732
01:10:40,070 --> 01:10:40,890
Any Blanka players?

1733
01:10:43,450 --> 01:10:45,370
Any Blanka players in chat?

1734
01:10:45,530 --> 01:10:46,810
Which taunt is it?

1735
01:10:48,230 --> 01:10:49,010
Oh, there we go.

1736
01:10:49,090 --> 01:10:49,350
That?

1737
01:10:50,690 --> 01:10:51,190
Yeah.

1738
01:10:52,270 --> 01:10:52,770
Alright.

1739
01:10:52,930 --> 01:11:00,230
So now, the only thing that he can do while you're holding parry is if I grab you.

1740
01:11:00,450 --> 01:11:02,770
Oh yeah, Blanka players love that.

1741
01:11:03,510 --> 01:11:03,930
Yeah.

1742
01:11:04,050 --> 01:11:05,410
And that's okay.

1743
01:11:05,530 --> 01:11:11,030
It's better to take the grab compared to taking the more bigger damage in the future.

1744
01:11:11,070 --> 01:11:11,490
Oh, okay.

1745
01:11:12,890 --> 01:11:18,650
So if you just see this, I feel like most of the time if it's like a low...

1746
01:11:19,130 --> 01:11:24,430
If it's like a beginning Blanka player, they'll probably just do this all day.

1747
01:11:24,570 --> 01:11:24,790
Yeah.

1748
01:11:25,770 --> 01:11:28,370
I've seen a lot of Blankas that did that, yeah.

1749
01:11:29,030 --> 01:11:30,330
Yeah, so let's see.

1750
01:11:30,510 --> 01:11:31,210
If you...

1751
01:11:31,210 --> 01:11:33,430
Let me get that doll again.

1752
01:11:33,710 --> 01:11:34,930
So hold parry for me.

1753
01:11:35,110 --> 01:11:36,370
So if I do that...

1754
01:11:39,550 --> 01:11:46,450
And then they do the second slide, then you would be able to get the big punish that you just learned.

1755
01:11:48,070 --> 01:11:48,790
Which one?

1756
01:11:49,370 --> 01:11:50,610
The auto heavy.

1757
01:11:50,790 --> 01:11:50,990
Oh.

1758
01:11:51,770 --> 01:11:53,490
We learned so many.

1759
01:11:53,650 --> 01:11:55,190
I had to be specific.

1760
01:11:55,450 --> 01:11:55,970
The auto heavy?

1761
01:11:56,150 --> 01:11:56,570
Yeah.

1762
01:11:57,450 --> 01:11:59,250
Let's try to do it a little bit faster.

1763
01:11:59,290 --> 01:12:00,070
Okay, okay.

1764
01:12:06,290 --> 01:12:07,390
There you go.

1765
01:12:08,450 --> 01:12:12,570
You just have to let go of parry right away after you parry the third hit.

1766
01:12:26,340 --> 01:12:27,140
Yeah, there you go.

1767
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:27,520
Yeah!

1768
01:12:28,580 --> 01:12:29,480
There you go.

1769
01:12:29,820 --> 01:12:31,480
This is your last ride!

1770
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:32,600
We did it!

1771
01:12:35,220 --> 01:12:36,060
Look at that.

1772
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:36,640
That's big damage.

1773
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,600
Okay, that's half.

1774
01:12:40,260 --> 01:12:42,000
So now this move is very annoying.

1775
01:12:42,260 --> 01:12:42,540
Yeah.

1776
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:47,460
So what you want to do is obviously you can parry everything.

1777
01:12:47,660 --> 01:12:48,000
Yeah.

1778
01:12:48,460 --> 01:12:53,440
But if they come at you, you could do Larry or you could do jump command throw.

1779
01:12:54,380 --> 01:12:55,380
Oh, okay.

1780
01:12:55,460 --> 01:12:56,960
Like the jump special grab.

1781
01:12:57,320 --> 01:12:58,540
I did time that.

1782
01:12:58,980 --> 01:12:59,500
Yeah.

1783
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:04,820
So you could do that.

1784
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:08,140
Yeah, you just have to be a little fast with it.

1785
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:08,520
Yeah.

1786
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:08,840
Whoa.

1787
01:13:10,280 --> 01:13:10,800
No.

1788
01:13:11,460 --> 01:13:15,020
You can even do the OD one to do more damage if you want.

1789
01:13:15,740 --> 01:13:16,260
Okay.

1790
01:13:19,680 --> 01:13:22,580
Yeah, this is probably the most annoying.

1791
01:13:25,300 --> 01:13:25,780
Yeah.

1792
01:13:25,940 --> 01:13:27,960
His thing is faster than the other jumps.

1793
01:13:28,980 --> 01:13:29,460
Yeah.

1794
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:35,440
So if it's from here, then you go for the jump throw.

1795
01:13:35,700 --> 01:13:36,340
Yeah, okay.

1796
01:13:36,660 --> 01:13:40,180
If it's from here, then it's much harder, obviously.

1797
01:13:40,780 --> 01:13:43,320
Then you can do Larry or hold parry.

1798
01:13:45,100 --> 01:13:48,020
So it's between those two options on whatever you feel comfortable with.

1799
01:13:49,740 --> 01:13:50,860
Oh, it still hits.

1800
01:13:51,080 --> 01:13:51,480
Yeah.

1801
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:52,320
Yeah.

1802
01:13:52,440 --> 01:13:56,360
As long as it comes out, it will always hit.

1803
01:13:56,460 --> 01:13:56,840
Okay.

1804
01:13:58,660 --> 01:14:04,140
But like obviously the thing is that he can kind of change the trajectory to not come at you.

1805
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:04,640
Yeah.

1806
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:06,440
Right?

1807
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:07,520
If you wanted to.

1808
01:14:07,640 --> 01:14:09,620
So that's the one thing you have to be careful about.

1809
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:11,660
Oh, yeah.

1810
01:14:11,740 --> 01:14:12,840
And then you bait me.

1811
01:14:12,980 --> 01:14:15,240
But that's okay.

1812
01:14:15,340 --> 01:14:21,600
I think even if they baited you, I think it's fine because it's only from far away that they can bait you.

1813
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:22,240
Yeah.

1814
01:14:22,260 --> 01:14:24,840
If I do it from like right here, I can't bait you.

1815
01:14:25,220 --> 01:14:26,920
Like the Larry will always hit.

1816
01:14:28,060 --> 01:14:30,580
And you can probably do the level one super.

1817
01:14:30,680 --> 01:14:32,160
Do you use the level one super at all?

1818
01:14:32,340 --> 01:14:33,180
Oh, no.

1819
01:14:33,340 --> 01:14:34,840
I just save it for level three.

1820
01:14:35,700 --> 01:14:36,100
Okay.

1821
01:14:36,340 --> 01:14:42,680
So against Blanka, it's not necessary, but Lily is very necessary that you have to use the level one.

1822
01:14:43,820 --> 01:14:44,340
Let's see.

1823
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:44,720
Let's go.

1824
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:46,000
I'm going to pick Lily.

1825
01:14:53,250 --> 01:14:53,650
Yeah.

1826
01:14:53,690 --> 01:14:57,850
This is actually Zangief's hardest matchup.

1827
01:14:59,630 --> 01:15:00,710
Like no joke.

1828
01:15:04,210 --> 01:15:04,910
No joke.

1829
01:15:07,030 --> 01:15:09,390
The reason why is because of this move.

1830
01:15:11,950 --> 01:15:13,950
Like this move is just very, very annoying.

1831
01:15:14,070 --> 01:15:14,170
Oh, yeah.

1832
01:15:14,170 --> 01:15:15,650
No, I'm having PTSD right now.

1833
01:15:16,750 --> 01:15:17,250
Yeah.

1834
01:15:19,030 --> 01:15:20,890
Was that what you learned?

1835
01:15:22,730 --> 01:15:23,130
Yeah.

1836
01:15:23,130 --> 01:15:24,870
I have some PTSD from this guy.

1837
01:15:25,670 --> 01:15:26,070
Okay.

1838
01:15:26,110 --> 01:15:26,290
Okay.

1839
01:15:26,430 --> 01:15:31,470
So now, when you see this move, do the level one super.

1840
01:15:31,650 --> 01:15:32,690
Just, you know, press the...

1841
01:15:33,990 --> 01:15:35,490
I don't remember what it was.

1842
01:15:36,090 --> 01:15:36,910
Special move heavy.

1843
01:15:37,190 --> 01:15:37,930
Special move heavy?

1844
01:15:39,090 --> 01:15:39,490
Okay.

1845
01:15:39,490 --> 01:15:39,890
Yeah.

1846
01:15:40,550 --> 01:15:41,170
So watch.

1847
01:15:41,830 --> 01:15:43,110
We're going to go one, two, three.

1848
01:15:43,130 --> 01:15:43,310
Okay.

1849
01:15:43,390 --> 01:15:44,710
One, two, three.

1850
01:15:46,970 --> 01:15:47,630
Let's try again.

1851
01:15:48,110 --> 01:15:49,710
I'm going to do the slow one first.

1852
01:15:49,890 --> 01:15:50,090
Yeah.

1853
01:15:51,670 --> 01:15:52,110
Okay.

1854
01:15:52,770 --> 01:15:54,230
Is there a slower version?

1855
01:15:55,690 --> 01:15:56,870
That is a slow version.

1856
01:15:56,990 --> 01:15:57,210
Okay.

1857
01:15:57,230 --> 01:15:58,690
I'm going to start from far.

1858
01:15:58,710 --> 01:15:59,090
Okay.

1859
01:15:59,470 --> 01:16:00,670
I'm going to start from far.

1860
01:16:01,630 --> 01:16:02,430
This is...

1861
01:16:02,430 --> 01:16:03,270
Oh, shit.

1862
01:16:03,310 --> 01:16:03,750
The range.

1863
01:16:04,370 --> 01:16:04,790
Yeah.

1864
01:16:04,830 --> 01:16:05,030
Yeah.

1865
01:16:05,050 --> 01:16:05,190
Yeah.

1866
01:16:07,590 --> 01:16:08,030
Oh.

1867
01:16:08,310 --> 01:16:09,530
That was too fast.

1868
01:16:09,710 --> 01:16:14,290
It still works, but you want to do it when you see it come out.

1869
01:16:16,330 --> 01:16:16,970
You see?

1870
01:16:17,070 --> 01:16:20,050
Because you don't want to preemptively do it.

1871
01:16:21,510 --> 01:16:21,950
Okay.

1872
01:16:24,230 --> 01:16:24,990
There you go.

1873
01:16:25,030 --> 01:16:25,370
Good job.

1874
01:16:25,550 --> 01:16:25,990
Yay!

1875
01:16:27,250 --> 01:16:28,110
Get down.

1876
01:16:28,190 --> 01:16:29,910
Now I'm going to do the fast one.

1877
01:16:30,130 --> 01:16:30,490
Okay.

1878
01:16:32,530 --> 01:16:32,970
Nice.

1879
01:16:34,790 --> 01:16:35,870
Down, little girl.

1880
01:16:36,490 --> 01:16:36,930
Yeah.

1881
01:16:37,030 --> 01:16:40,830
So that is like your saving grace of that one.

1882
01:16:40,950 --> 01:16:41,250
Okay.

1883
01:16:41,370 --> 01:16:41,770
Okay.

1884
01:16:42,010 --> 01:16:43,990
So now the other one that you have...

1885
01:16:44,550 --> 01:16:47,670
players like to do is obviously this is their favorite button in the world.

1886
01:16:48,070 --> 01:16:48,910
Oh, yeah.

1887
01:16:49,470 --> 01:16:49,870
Alright.

1888
01:16:50,770 --> 01:16:54,470
So what you want to do is you want to block block it, like block low.

1889
01:16:56,190 --> 01:16:57,390
And they're going to do this.

1890
01:16:58,010 --> 01:16:58,410
Okay.

1891
01:16:58,590 --> 01:16:58,910
They're right.

1892
01:16:59,090 --> 01:16:59,930
They're going to do this.

1893
01:17:00,350 --> 01:17:04,330
So what you do is you just, when you see this move, you drive impact.

1894
01:17:06,370 --> 01:17:08,830
So drive impact before this move hits you.

1895
01:17:08,930 --> 01:17:09,230
Okay.

1896
01:17:09,310 --> 01:17:11,830
So you drive impact after the two hits.

1897
01:17:12,030 --> 01:17:12,290
Alright.

1898
01:17:15,110 --> 01:17:15,790
There you go.

1899
01:17:17,810 --> 01:17:18,330
Okay.

1900
01:17:19,730 --> 01:17:25,890
Because the Lily players will always go for this because this is like her best way to get wins.

1901
01:17:26,070 --> 01:17:26,490
Yeah.

1902
01:17:26,670 --> 01:17:27,690
Get down, child.

1903
01:17:30,030 --> 01:17:31,330
But the only thing...

1904
01:17:31,330 --> 01:17:34,430
I don't know if the other Lily player will learn this.

1905
01:17:35,150 --> 01:17:42,830
Is that if they do the fake one like this and you drive impact, I can drive impact back.

1906
01:17:44,710 --> 01:17:45,750
Oh, yeah.

1907
01:17:46,410 --> 01:17:46,930
Yeah.

1908
01:17:46,990 --> 01:17:49,790
So I'm not sure if they will do that.

1909
01:17:49,870 --> 01:17:54,110
But if you do see that, just know that I told you and don't blame me if that happens.

1910
01:17:57,090 --> 01:17:59,830
I will 100% blame you.

1911
01:18:01,270 --> 01:18:03,090
That's all I'm going to say because like...

1912
01:18:03,650 --> 01:18:06,910
Now that you say it out loud, she's going to know now.

1913
01:18:07,510 --> 01:18:08,910
How do you know?

1914
01:18:08,950 --> 01:18:10,010
What if she watches my fun?

1915
01:18:10,670 --> 01:18:14,910
What if they're like scouting us out?

1916
01:18:15,430 --> 01:18:16,850
I got to cover the bases.

1917
01:18:19,810 --> 01:18:21,970
I don't want to be on record.

1918
01:18:22,150 --> 01:18:27,110
Justin Wong has told me to when I see this move, drive impact every single time.

1919
01:18:32,910 --> 01:18:36,150
If I don't make it to the finals, Justin Wong coached me.

1920
01:18:40,770 --> 01:18:42,510
Changing the words up a little bit.

1921
01:18:44,590 --> 01:18:45,430
So now...

1922
01:18:45,430 --> 01:18:48,710
So now the last thing is that let's say...

1923
01:18:49,950 --> 01:18:51,230
Can you block low?

1924
01:18:51,370 --> 01:18:51,790
Yeah.

1925
01:18:52,330 --> 01:18:54,730
Let's say you block this.

1926
01:18:55,690 --> 01:18:56,130
Yeah.

1927
01:18:56,350 --> 01:19:03,510
And you remember how the headbutt if you press headbutt if I block headbutt, you press button, I press button, I lose.

1928
01:19:03,650 --> 01:19:04,050
Remember that?

1929
01:19:05,090 --> 01:19:06,970
So this is the same thing with her.

1930
01:19:07,210 --> 01:19:10,010
If you block this move, you can't press button.

1931
01:19:10,010 --> 01:19:10,650
Okay.

1932
01:19:11,630 --> 01:19:12,070
Right?

1933
01:19:12,730 --> 01:19:13,170
So...

1934
01:19:13,170 --> 01:19:15,730
What you want to do is...

1935
01:19:15,730 --> 01:19:16,770
There's two ways.

1936
01:19:16,850 --> 01:19:18,590
Let's say you're like I don't like the pressure.

1937
01:19:18,870 --> 01:19:20,210
I don't want to deal with it.

1938
01:19:20,290 --> 01:19:25,910
Just do hold forward and while you're blocking hold forward and press drive impact back.

1939
01:19:27,890 --> 01:19:29,170
So like do it while blocking.

1940
01:19:29,170 --> 01:19:30,110
The kickoff thing.

1941
01:19:30,210 --> 01:19:30,470
Okay.

1942
01:19:30,570 --> 01:19:31,750
Yeah, the kickoff.

1943
01:19:32,750 --> 01:19:35,270
So you do that to get off of me.

1944
01:19:35,910 --> 01:19:36,350
Or...

1945
01:19:37,070 --> 01:19:38,170
If you think...

1946
01:19:38,170 --> 01:19:41,650
Because what they can do also is they can go for...

1947
01:19:42,290 --> 01:19:43,270
Let's say you don't do that, right?

1948
01:19:43,370 --> 01:19:43,510
Okay.

1949
01:19:44,350 --> 01:19:45,690
They can go for...

1950
01:19:46,330 --> 01:19:46,830
Oh yeah, that.

1951
01:19:47,230 --> 01:19:48,190
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1952
01:19:48,690 --> 01:19:54,870
So what you do is if you think that move is coming you hold up right away.

1953
01:19:55,470 --> 01:19:55,950
Okay.

1954
01:19:58,330 --> 01:19:59,010
You see?

1955
01:19:59,110 --> 01:19:59,550
It misses.

1956
01:19:59,850 --> 01:20:00,210
Yeah.

1957
01:20:00,210 --> 01:20:05,930
So then you come down press heavy and press auto heavy right away.

1958
01:20:10,610 --> 01:20:11,090
Oh.

1959
01:20:11,670 --> 01:20:12,150
Yeah.

1960
01:20:12,410 --> 01:20:16,330
So you can do all... you can come down and press your heavy button and then you do auto heavy.

1961
01:20:18,490 --> 01:20:18,970
Yeah.

1962
01:20:20,190 --> 01:20:20,670
Yep.

1963
01:20:21,690 --> 01:20:23,050
Goodbye little girl.

1964
01:20:23,690 --> 01:20:24,170
Yep.

1965
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:32,700
So that's pretty much you're going to be your big counterpicks against... Uh huh.

1966
01:20:33,700 --> 01:20:34,460
Against Lily.

1967
01:20:35,380 --> 01:20:35,860
Okay.

1968
01:20:35,880 --> 01:20:36,340
So...

1969
01:20:37,380 --> 01:20:40,040
So I'm going to ask you what do you remember?

1970
01:20:40,520 --> 01:20:41,000
Okay.

1971
01:20:41,580 --> 01:20:42,720
I remember...

1972
01:20:42,720 --> 01:20:44,680
the get off button.

1973
01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:45,960
Uh huh.

1974
01:20:46,500 --> 01:20:50,000
So when you do the thing and then...

1975
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:54,600
Okay, when you do the thing now...

1976
01:20:55,350 --> 01:20:56,240
I do this.

1977
01:20:57,100 --> 01:20:57,680
Okay.

1978
01:20:58,840 --> 01:21:01,360
And then the other thing.

1979
01:21:02,780 --> 01:21:03,360
Okay.

1980
01:21:03,660 --> 01:21:04,660
This one, right?

1981
01:21:04,840 --> 01:21:05,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1982
01:21:05,580 --> 01:21:06,540
What do you do on this one?

1983
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:08,980
Um...

1984
01:21:08,980 --> 01:21:09,560
Give me a sec.

1985
01:21:11,640 --> 01:21:12,220
That's okay.

1986
01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:14,280
Give me a sec.

1987
01:21:14,360 --> 01:21:14,820
Drive impact.

1988
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:15,500
Drive impact.

1989
01:21:15,700 --> 01:21:16,300
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

1990
01:21:16,440 --> 01:21:16,960
Drive impact.

1991
01:21:21,340 --> 01:21:23,960
Yeah, remember before the third hit hits you.

1992
01:21:25,260 --> 01:21:25,700
Yeah.

1993
01:21:26,360 --> 01:21:26,800
This one.

1994
01:21:28,140 --> 01:21:28,580
Okay.

1995
01:21:29,300 --> 01:21:32,720
And what do you do when she does this move?

1996
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:34,160
From far?

1997
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:34,620
Oh.

1998
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:36,360
Like let's say before...

1999
01:21:36,900 --> 01:21:37,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2000
01:21:38,980 --> 01:21:39,880
Oh no, I'm on the other side.

2001
01:21:40,920 --> 01:21:42,620
You still only press two buttons.

2002
01:21:45,860 --> 01:21:47,300
You don't need any direction.

2003
01:21:47,580 --> 01:21:48,620
You just press the two buttons.

2004
01:21:49,660 --> 01:21:50,780
It's not that one.

2005
01:21:50,980 --> 01:21:52,020
It throws me off.

2006
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:53,800
It throws me off.

2007
01:21:54,440 --> 01:21:56,160
Left hand, left hand, left hand.

2008
01:21:56,320 --> 01:21:56,840
I know, I know.

2009
01:21:58,240 --> 01:22:00,700
It just, it throws me off.

2010
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:03,660
Are you ready?

2011
01:22:03,900 --> 01:22:04,440
Yeah, yeah.

2012
01:22:07,100 --> 01:22:09,600
Okay, I'm actually ready for real, okay?

2013
01:22:09,740 --> 01:22:10,740
I'm ready for real.

2014
01:22:11,060 --> 01:22:11,800
Okay, okay, okay.

2015
01:22:12,020 --> 01:22:14,420
This is tournament on the life right here, okay?

2016
01:22:14,440 --> 01:22:15,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2017
01:22:15,260 --> 01:22:18,560
If you do, if you land this you win the tournament for your whole team.

2018
01:22:18,660 --> 01:22:18,880
Okay.

2019
01:22:21,260 --> 01:22:22,120
There you go.

2020
01:22:22,720 --> 01:22:23,720
Oh my god!

2021
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:25,280
I won Twitch Rivals!

2022
01:22:25,480 --> 01:22:25,940
Let's go!

2023
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:29,740
And with the tea bag too, huh?

2024
01:22:29,780 --> 01:22:30,220
Yeah!

2025
01:22:32,140 --> 01:22:32,580
Okay.

2026
01:22:33,700 --> 01:22:41,060
So now let's say if you don't want to spend the drive reversal and you block it and Lily goes for a command throw, what do you do after this?

2027
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:42,520
Oh, what the fuck?

2028
01:22:42,720 --> 01:22:43,060
Okay!

2029
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:44,400
Remember?

2030
01:22:44,820 --> 01:22:45,880
Oh, you gotta block it.

2031
01:22:45,880 --> 01:22:46,240
Block low.

2032
01:22:46,360 --> 01:22:46,900
Okay, okay, he's alright.

2033
01:22:48,920 --> 01:22:49,400
Woo!

2034
01:22:49,660 --> 01:22:49,980
Oops.

2035
01:22:51,220 --> 01:22:53,540
Or the, uh, heavy, auto-heavy.

2036
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:54,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2037
01:22:57,760 --> 01:22:58,620
There you go.

2038
01:23:00,900 --> 01:23:01,380
Yeah!

2039
01:23:01,380 --> 01:23:02,420
We're doing it!

2040
01:23:03,300 --> 01:23:03,780
Boom!

2041
01:23:06,300 --> 01:23:09,000
Alright, I'm going to teach you a very scrubby strategy.

2042
01:23:09,460 --> 01:23:10,320
Oh my god!

2043
01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:11,580
I love scrubby strategies!

2044
01:23:15,800 --> 01:23:18,700
Because I think this will work a few times.

2045
01:23:19,020 --> 01:23:19,720
So we'll see.

2046
01:23:19,860 --> 01:23:20,340
Oh my god.

2047
01:23:20,600 --> 01:23:23,260
I'll only use it in the finals so they won't train for it.

2048
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:30,420
Alright, I'm going to do it and see how you deal with it.

2049
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:31,200
I'm going to do this.

2050
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:33,220
Oh yeah, this!

2051
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:34,880
Yeah, yeah!

2052
01:23:35,300 --> 01:23:36,180
You know about this?

2053
01:23:36,340 --> 01:23:38,240
Yeah, I try to do it in ranked.

2054
01:23:38,380 --> 01:23:40,040
I failed spectacularly.

2055
01:23:43,720 --> 01:23:45,080
What the fuck, man?

2056
01:23:46,140 --> 01:23:48,840
I don't even know how to deal with it from other characters.

2057
01:23:51,100 --> 01:23:53,260
I mean, you have the right idea with the parry.

2058
01:23:53,400 --> 01:23:53,600
Yeah.

2059
01:23:55,180 --> 01:23:59,740
So that's something that you can probably do for like a few extra hits.

2060
01:23:59,960 --> 01:24:00,580
Do you know how to do that move?

2061
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:02,120
Yeah, I do, but like...

2062
01:24:02,640 --> 01:24:03,400
Yeah, there you go.

2063
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:06,260
I try to do it in ranked, but I got fucked up.

2064
01:24:14,080 --> 01:24:21,160
So what you can do is after you... let's say you land that, go to the special move right away.

2065
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:21,680
Okay.

2066
01:24:25,300 --> 01:24:27,000
Yeah, wait a little bit.

2067
01:24:27,700 --> 01:24:28,440
There you go.

2068
01:24:31,160 --> 01:24:32,940
So you can do that as well too.

2069
01:24:37,340 --> 01:24:40,060
Or you can do auto heavy as well too.

2070
01:24:40,180 --> 01:24:41,480
Remember, the heads or tails.

2071
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:42,280
Yeah.

2072
01:24:52,980 --> 01:24:53,540
Yeah.

2073
01:24:53,780 --> 01:24:54,340
Yeah!

2074
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:56,840
My loyal fan.

2075
01:24:58,500 --> 01:24:59,680
Okay, and what other...

2076
01:24:59,680 --> 01:25:01,440
You said Cammy or Bison.

2077
01:25:01,660 --> 01:25:02,600
Yeah, Bison.

2078
01:25:03,720 --> 01:25:04,820
Who's playing Bison?

2079
01:25:05,940 --> 01:25:06,460
Canna.

2080
01:25:08,260 --> 01:25:09,300
Another VTuber.

2081
01:25:10,620 --> 01:25:12,480
Do you know if she's playing Modern or Classic?

2082
01:25:12,700 --> 01:25:13,000
Modern.

2083
01:25:13,560 --> 01:25:20,060
I know that Blanka, Bison are playing Modern.

2084
01:25:20,240 --> 01:25:22,680
I think Cammy, Aki, and Lily are Classic.

2085
01:25:23,580 --> 01:25:24,740
Okay, yeah, okay.

2086
01:25:25,260 --> 01:25:26,320
Let's go to Bison.

2087
01:25:27,560 --> 01:25:28,440
Where's Bison?

2088
01:25:28,660 --> 01:25:29,780
Bison just has scissor kick.

2089
01:25:29,960 --> 01:25:30,380
Scissor kick.

2090
01:25:30,660 --> 01:25:31,900
That little tornado shit.

2091
01:25:33,060 --> 01:25:35,640
That little tornado thingy that they do.

2092
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:36,940
That shit's fucked.

2093
01:25:37,020 --> 01:25:37,260
What, this move?

2094
01:25:37,540 --> 01:25:38,000
Hold on.

2095
01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:39,340
No, the...

2096
01:25:40,240 --> 01:25:41,220
Yeah, that shit.

2097
01:25:41,260 --> 01:25:41,860
That's so fucked.

2098
01:25:42,720 --> 01:25:43,880
Like you don't like this move?

2099
01:25:44,160 --> 01:25:44,860
Oh, fuck that.

2100
01:25:45,780 --> 01:25:47,580
If you block it, they die.

2101
01:25:47,940 --> 01:25:48,400
Oh.

2102
01:25:50,140 --> 01:25:50,620
Yeah.

2103
01:25:51,800 --> 01:25:52,600
It's just...

2104
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:54,420
It's so fast.

2105
01:25:56,380 --> 01:25:57,740
No, just sit there.

2106
01:25:58,080 --> 01:25:58,960
Just sit there, okay.

2107
01:25:59,560 --> 01:26:06,020
Yeah, because I think with your match, like when you play, you hold forward a lot.

2108
01:26:06,240 --> 01:26:06,900
Oh, yeah.

2109
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:10,120
No, I didn't pay $70 to block.

2110
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:12,060
But now I am blocking.

2111
01:26:12,100 --> 01:26:12,960
I'm blocking now.

2112
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:13,440
Okay.

2113
01:26:14,240 --> 01:26:16,360
So what I want you to do, think of it like this.

2114
01:26:17,160 --> 01:26:19,020
Like 1, 2, 3, down back.

2115
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:20,440
1, 2, 3, down back.

2116
01:26:20,580 --> 01:26:21,580
1, 2, 3, down back.

2117
01:26:21,700 --> 01:26:23,280
Just a little bit more of that.

2118
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:25,800
Yeah, exactly.

2119
01:26:26,140 --> 01:26:32,840
If you move around like that, there's less chance of you getting hit by this by just off of random.

2120
01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:35,860
This move is really good.

2121
01:26:39,820 --> 01:26:49,680
So what you want to do, if you block this move and let's say they do it from this close like that, you do OD SPD.

2122
01:26:50,480 --> 01:26:51,460
Yeah, okay.

2123
01:26:52,220 --> 01:26:54,420
So do the OD special grab.

2124
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:55,040
Alright.

2125
01:26:57,620 --> 01:26:58,140
Yeah.

2126
01:26:58,960 --> 01:26:59,260
That's a punish.

2127
01:26:59,680 --> 01:27:00,860
I can't avoid that.

2128
01:27:00,860 --> 01:27:01,300
That's a punish.

2129
01:27:03,180 --> 01:27:03,620
Okay.

2130
01:27:04,420 --> 01:27:05,700
I can avoid that one.

2131
01:27:06,700 --> 01:27:09,040
That has to be the regular one that you just did.

2132
01:27:10,900 --> 01:27:11,820
Yep, that one.

2133
01:27:12,100 --> 01:27:12,400
Yay!

2134
01:27:14,180 --> 01:27:16,420
So I think this move is also annoying.

2135
01:27:17,580 --> 01:27:20,540
So this move, if you block this, you can't press a button.

2136
01:27:21,300 --> 01:27:22,120
I'm blue here.

2137
01:27:22,460 --> 01:27:22,760
Okay.

2138
01:27:25,640 --> 01:27:26,080
Yeah.

2139
01:27:26,080 --> 01:27:28,060
So what you want to do is try the lariat.

2140
01:27:28,380 --> 01:27:28,780
Okay.

2141
01:27:29,660 --> 01:27:30,060
Oops.

2142
01:27:32,180 --> 01:27:32,580
Yep.

2143
01:27:37,630 --> 01:27:38,030
Yep.

2144
01:27:40,310 --> 01:27:40,710
Okay.

2145
01:27:41,450 --> 01:27:49,110
And now, this move, if you block this move right here, you can press...

2146
01:27:50,910 --> 01:27:53,170
Let's see if you can press auto heavy after this.

2147
01:27:54,510 --> 01:27:55,550
Yeah, there you go.

2148
01:27:55,550 --> 01:27:56,770
So that works too.

2149
01:27:56,970 --> 01:27:57,450
Yay!

2150
01:28:02,660 --> 01:28:08,700
So now, the tricks, some of the tricks you have to respect when you're fighting against Bison.

2151
01:28:08,720 --> 01:28:08,960
Okay.

2152
01:28:10,120 --> 01:28:11,240
So don't block.

2153
01:28:14,240 --> 01:28:15,720
Have you seen this move?

2154
01:28:15,780 --> 01:28:16,720
The little thing on your stomach?

2155
01:28:16,720 --> 01:28:17,500
Yeah, I have.

2156
01:28:17,860 --> 01:28:18,980
Oh yes, I have.

2157
01:28:20,220 --> 01:28:22,260
What do you do against this move?

2158
01:28:22,580 --> 01:28:23,460
I don't remember.

2159
01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:24,840
It just disappears.

2160
01:28:24,840 --> 01:28:25,100
It just disappears.

2161
01:28:26,660 --> 01:28:30,300
Once you see it like glow, especially purple, like it's about to blow up.

2162
01:28:30,420 --> 01:28:30,800
Yeah.

2163
01:28:31,320 --> 01:28:32,500
Just hold parry.

2164
01:28:33,020 --> 01:28:34,340
Like wait, wait for it.

2165
01:28:35,780 --> 01:28:38,120
I don't want you to hold it like right away.

2166
01:28:38,200 --> 01:28:41,740
I want you to hold it when it's like, when you see that like, oh, it's about to blow up.

2167
01:28:44,480 --> 01:28:44,860
Okay.

2168
01:28:45,620 --> 01:28:46,260
Just wait.

2169
01:28:48,080 --> 01:28:48,460
Go.

2170
01:28:48,820 --> 01:28:49,200
Yay!

2171
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:52,840
So that's one way to stop it.

2172
01:28:52,940 --> 01:28:59,120
Another way is, if I overextend, if you hit me, like just press any button, it goes away.

2173
01:28:59,240 --> 01:29:00,740
Oh yeah, that's what happens for me.

2174
01:29:00,980 --> 01:29:01,940
It just disappears.

2175
01:29:03,920 --> 01:29:11,040
So now, the other thing is, let's say you, I have this move and you block and start blocking.

2176
01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:11,600
Yeah.

2177
01:29:15,860 --> 01:29:17,100
Yeah, so block.

2178
01:29:17,220 --> 01:29:17,900
Put a virus.

2179
01:29:18,980 --> 01:29:19,460
Yeah.

2180
01:29:19,500 --> 01:29:22,780
I automatically blow that move up.

2181
01:29:23,020 --> 01:29:23,500
Okay.

2182
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:31,360
So that means, anytime I blow that move up on my terms, never press a button.

2183
01:29:31,700 --> 01:29:32,240
Okay.

2184
01:29:32,820 --> 01:29:33,940
Never press a button.

2185
01:29:35,960 --> 01:29:36,820
Just block.

2186
01:29:37,180 --> 01:29:37,720
Woo!

2187
01:29:38,220 --> 01:29:41,060
Yeah, you just have to block.

2188
01:29:41,220 --> 01:29:41,780
Yeah, yeah.

2189
01:29:41,800 --> 01:29:43,560
Just remember that.

2190
01:29:44,140 --> 01:29:50,960
This move right here, if you block this move, don't press a button.

2191
01:29:51,320 --> 01:29:51,760
Okay.

2192
01:29:52,540 --> 01:29:59,440
Yeah, it's just one of those things that you just, like if you see this move, okay, they can still keep attacking.

2193
01:29:59,920 --> 01:30:00,700
Oh, okay.

2194
01:30:01,440 --> 01:30:03,520
Yeah, so it's kind of like your headbutt, right?

2195
01:30:03,660 --> 01:30:04,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2196
01:30:04,680 --> 01:30:07,800
If I block the headbutt, then you can keep attacking.

2197
01:30:09,900 --> 01:30:11,760
So it's very simple.

2198
01:30:11,800 --> 01:30:12,140
Don't mash.

2199
01:30:12,680 --> 01:30:13,600
Yeah, there you go.

2200
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:13,860
Yeah, yeah.

2201
01:30:18,640 --> 01:30:21,920
Yep, and then you go for the grab, right?

2202
01:30:21,960 --> 01:30:22,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2203
01:30:22,540 --> 01:30:24,520
Whenever you feel like it.

2204
01:30:25,460 --> 01:30:26,180
I mashed.

2205
01:30:32,780 --> 01:30:37,640
I would say that's pretty much that's pretty much Bison in a nutshell.

2206
01:30:37,640 --> 01:30:39,120
Oh, there's also this move right here.

2207
01:30:39,980 --> 01:30:40,340
Um...

2208
01:30:41,020 --> 01:30:42,160
Have you seen this super before?

2209
01:30:47,330 --> 01:30:47,730
Sometimes.

2210
01:30:47,890 --> 01:30:49,710
Not a lot, though, for this one.

2211
01:30:49,910 --> 01:30:50,730
Yeah, okay.

2212
01:30:50,890 --> 01:30:57,470
Just in case, if they somehow, if you see Bison go in the air, they can choose either left or right.

2213
01:30:57,630 --> 01:30:58,210
Uh-huh.

2214
01:30:59,030 --> 01:31:04,090
So it's kind of, you know, sometimes it's hard to block, like, oh, it's going to be on this side, so I have to block it, right?

2215
01:31:04,390 --> 01:31:07,690
So if you see this super ever, just hold parry.

2216
01:31:07,830 --> 01:31:09,230
Because it blocks both sides.

2217
01:31:11,450 --> 01:31:11,850
Yeah.

2218
01:31:12,730 --> 01:31:15,030
It will literally just block both sides.

2219
01:31:16,130 --> 01:31:24,110
And any time you block a super or you parry a super, you just do auto-heavy right away.

2220
01:31:26,690 --> 01:31:27,170
Yep.

2221
01:31:27,750 --> 01:31:28,230
Yay!

2222
01:31:29,790 --> 01:31:33,110
Yeah, you'll be able to punish every super with that, just like that.

2223
01:31:33,270 --> 01:31:33,590
Okay.

2224
01:31:34,930 --> 01:31:41,710
And even if you don't have three bars, you'll get the auto-heavy times two.

2225
01:31:41,810 --> 01:31:43,010
Like, do auto-heavy times two.

2226
01:31:43,010 --> 01:31:43,510
Okay.

2227
01:31:44,830 --> 01:31:45,230
Wait.

2228
01:31:45,650 --> 01:31:46,530
Yeah, you'll get that.

2229
01:31:46,650 --> 01:31:46,970
Okay.

2230
01:31:48,170 --> 01:31:51,410
Yeah, so if you don't have three bars, you'll just get that one.

2231
01:31:51,650 --> 01:31:52,050
Okay.

2232
01:31:52,870 --> 01:31:56,310
Which is still pretty good damage, regardless, you know?

2233
01:31:56,490 --> 01:31:57,110
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2234
01:31:57,770 --> 01:32:00,310
I mean, I got a hit on a Bison.

2235
01:32:01,230 --> 01:32:02,410
Dude, you got a hit.

2236
01:32:02,650 --> 01:32:03,050
Yeah.

2237
01:32:04,470 --> 01:32:06,190
And then Cammy...

2238
01:32:08,330 --> 01:32:09,950
Cammy and Aki.

2239
01:32:13,010 --> 01:32:14,070
Oh my god, I hate fighting.

2240
01:32:14,530 --> 01:32:15,690
I hate fighting Cammy.

2241
01:32:16,090 --> 01:32:16,650
Why?

2242
01:32:16,970 --> 01:32:18,190
Is you too fast?

2243
01:32:18,690 --> 01:32:22,070
It's the... it's also similar to tornado shit.

2244
01:32:22,390 --> 01:32:23,390
It throws me off.

2245
01:32:23,930 --> 01:32:27,170
Yeah, I hate that move so much.

2246
01:32:27,470 --> 01:32:41,030
I think once you learn, once you start doing like walk, block, walk, block, walk, block instead of just walk, then I think you'll you won't mind that move too much, because then you'll just block, right?

2247
01:32:41,170 --> 01:32:41,450
Okay.

2248
01:32:41,530 --> 01:32:46,690
So instead of doing this, like what you're doing, you walk, down, back.

2249
01:32:46,870 --> 01:32:47,950
Walk, down, back.

2250
01:32:48,030 --> 01:32:48,890
Walk, down, back.

2251
01:32:52,450 --> 01:32:53,150
Yeah, see?

2252
01:32:53,310 --> 01:32:54,350
So it should be like that.

2253
01:32:55,830 --> 01:32:56,430
You see?

2254
01:32:56,570 --> 01:33:00,630
And then anytime you block Spiral Arrow, do special move.

2255
01:33:07,010 --> 01:33:07,470
Right?

2256
01:33:07,470 --> 01:33:08,290
So there's that.

2257
01:33:08,830 --> 01:33:10,650
The only other move... so the...

2258
01:33:10,650 --> 01:33:13,830
If you block this move, don't press button.

2259
01:33:17,260 --> 01:33:18,300
Yeah, don't press the button.

2260
01:33:18,400 --> 01:33:22,660
But if you see that move coming, you can press your crouching light.

2261
01:33:23,240 --> 01:33:23,640
Okay.

2262
01:33:25,320 --> 01:33:27,300
So try to press it before I hit you.

2263
01:33:27,580 --> 01:33:29,460
Oh, okay.

2264
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:33,520
And then do it two times, and then go for the command throw.

2265
01:33:34,260 --> 01:33:34,660
Okay.

2266
01:33:36,740 --> 01:33:37,140
Oops.

2267
01:33:37,580 --> 01:33:38,420
So do it before.

2268
01:33:39,960 --> 01:33:40,500
Yeah, see?

2269
01:33:40,840 --> 01:33:42,240
Don't press button if you block.

2270
01:33:42,320 --> 01:33:43,500
If you block, don't press button.

2271
01:33:44,380 --> 01:33:46,360
But press button before it hits you.

2272
01:33:48,640 --> 01:33:53,620
And then, yup, and then go for the throw after you hit it.

2273
01:33:55,300 --> 01:33:55,820
No!

2274
01:33:56,800 --> 01:33:57,320
Yeah.

2275
01:34:03,620 --> 01:34:04,140
There.

2276
01:34:04,160 --> 01:34:05,580
Go for the special move button.

2277
01:34:05,820 --> 01:34:08,600
Do one, two, special move.

2278
01:34:08,760 --> 01:34:09,020
Okay.

2279
01:34:09,860 --> 01:34:10,660
Oh, shit.

2280
01:34:11,080 --> 01:34:11,980
Yeah, you're fine.

2281
01:34:13,180 --> 01:34:13,660
No!

2282
01:34:14,380 --> 01:34:15,720
Yeah, not a cancel.

2283
01:34:17,180 --> 01:34:18,140
There you go.

2284
01:34:20,320 --> 01:34:22,040
So that's how you stop that move.

2285
01:34:22,200 --> 01:34:24,760
But remember, if you block it, don't press button.

2286
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:25,340
Okay.

2287
01:34:26,340 --> 01:34:30,120
You can also, if you see this move coming, you can drive impact it.

2288
01:34:31,660 --> 01:34:32,140
Alright.

2289
01:34:33,940 --> 01:34:34,920
A little faster.

2290
01:34:36,480 --> 01:34:36,960
Yup.

2291
01:34:38,940 --> 01:34:39,420
Yeehaw!

2292
01:34:41,960 --> 01:34:42,400
Yeah.

2293
01:34:42,500 --> 01:34:44,080
Yeah, that's gonna be really good as well, too.

2294
01:34:45,100 --> 01:34:47,420
And then there's this move, the dive kick.

2295
01:34:48,560 --> 01:34:49,160
Oh, yeah.

2296
01:34:49,300 --> 01:34:51,920
This is really hard to stop with Zangief.

2297
01:34:52,040 --> 01:34:54,020
Like, sometimes the lariat won't work here.

2298
01:34:54,200 --> 01:34:54,900
Yeah, yeah.

2299
01:34:55,400 --> 01:35:03,020
Yeah, so it's just kinda hard, but if you do it early, like you see, it'll sometimes happen like that, right?

2300
01:35:03,160 --> 01:35:03,460
Yeah.

2301
01:35:04,200 --> 01:35:07,340
But if you land the lariat early, then you'll win.

2302
01:35:07,940 --> 01:35:12,520
But let's say if it's a little bit too late, you always just, you can just try to parry it.

2303
01:35:12,760 --> 01:35:13,240
Okay.

2304
01:35:17,260 --> 01:35:19,880
Yeah, and then think of the parry as like an auto block.

2305
01:35:21,800 --> 01:35:24,120
Yeah, it's just like blocking for you.

2306
01:35:24,300 --> 01:35:24,780
Okay.

2307
01:35:26,060 --> 01:35:26,540
Yeah.

2308
01:35:26,540 --> 01:35:27,020
Understand.

2309
01:35:27,040 --> 01:35:30,560
The other thing is block low.

2310
01:35:30,840 --> 01:35:31,880
They might do this.

2311
01:35:35,570 --> 01:35:45,930
So what you wanna do is press your crouching light or press standing light before, after two hits.

2312
01:35:46,090 --> 01:35:46,610
Okay.

2313
01:35:47,570 --> 01:35:48,750
Yeah, like that.

2314
01:35:48,910 --> 01:35:49,130
Oh!

2315
01:35:50,750 --> 01:35:51,570
That's right.

2316
01:35:52,850 --> 01:35:53,750
That's fucking right.

2317
01:35:55,710 --> 01:35:58,610
There's so many camis and silver and bronze.

2318
01:36:05,830 --> 01:36:08,410
Try to press um...

2319
01:36:09,690 --> 01:36:10,910
Try to press crouching light.

2320
01:36:12,610 --> 01:36:14,130
Like after just two hits.

2321
01:36:14,290 --> 01:36:14,470
Okay.

2322
01:36:15,110 --> 01:36:15,790
Oops, sorry.

2323
01:36:17,910 --> 01:36:18,390
Yep.

2324
01:36:19,050 --> 01:36:23,590
So what I want you to try to do is do crouching light into down special.

2325
01:36:23,950 --> 01:36:24,430
Like right away.

2326
01:36:24,430 --> 01:36:25,330
Crouching light down special.

2327
01:36:25,490 --> 01:36:25,710
Okay.

2328
01:36:27,270 --> 01:36:27,750
Oh!

2329
01:36:27,750 --> 01:36:28,010
No!

2330
01:36:30,610 --> 01:36:31,370
There you go.

2331
01:36:33,390 --> 01:36:34,450
Oh, come on!

2332
01:36:35,250 --> 01:36:35,810
It's fine.

2333
01:36:38,470 --> 01:36:39,110
There you go.

2334
01:36:39,210 --> 01:36:41,490
So that's like your two hit combo for a punish.

2335
01:36:41,690 --> 01:36:42,090
Uh-huh.

2336
01:36:42,810 --> 01:36:43,210
Right.

2337
01:36:43,290 --> 01:36:45,770
So that's gonna be like your answer if you see them.

2338
01:36:46,610 --> 01:36:49,010
Because the thing is if you block the whole thing.

2339
01:36:49,090 --> 01:36:49,470
Yeah.

2340
01:36:49,750 --> 01:36:52,490
Let's say you block you can't press a button.

2341
01:36:52,670 --> 01:36:52,930
Yeah.

2342
01:36:54,470 --> 01:36:56,890
So you just have to remember that.

2343
01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:05,660
So if they like let's say you they do it to you in the match or on rank.

2344
01:37:05,820 --> 01:37:05,920
Uh-huh.

2345
01:37:05,920 --> 01:37:07,280
And you see them do it the first time.

2346
01:37:07,420 --> 01:37:08,960
Just be like oh I'm okay.

2347
01:37:09,080 --> 01:37:09,480
I remember.

2348
01:37:10,680 --> 01:37:11,240
That's not.

2349
01:37:11,380 --> 01:37:12,200
You can't do that.

2350
01:37:12,280 --> 01:37:13,220
I can press a button there.

2351
01:37:13,300 --> 01:37:13,880
You don't have to like.

2352
01:37:13,980 --> 01:37:14,300
Yeah.

2353
01:37:14,440 --> 01:37:16,120
Try to challenge it right away.

2354
01:37:16,240 --> 01:37:21,000
But it's just something for you to know that there is an answer to something like this.

2355
01:37:21,200 --> 01:37:21,380
Yeah.

2356
01:37:21,400 --> 01:37:21,600
Yeah.

2357
01:37:21,680 --> 01:37:21,840
Yeah.

2358
01:37:22,440 --> 01:37:23,300
Which is good.

2359
01:37:25,020 --> 01:37:25,820
Thank God.

2360
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:30,640
Everybody please Cammy.

2361
01:37:32,060 --> 01:37:33,340
Cammy is a very popular character.

2362
01:37:37,210 --> 01:37:37,570
Alright.

2363
01:37:38,330 --> 01:37:39,410
This is Aki.

2364
01:37:40,050 --> 01:37:40,410
Aki.

2365
01:37:40,670 --> 01:37:41,230
I mean.

2366
01:37:42,230 --> 01:37:44,030
I'm actually surprised somebody is playing Aki.

2367
01:37:44,830 --> 01:37:46,250
I don't see a lot of Akis.

2368
01:37:46,410 --> 01:37:48,670
I don't see a lot of Akis or what the fuck.

2369
01:37:48,710 --> 01:37:50,130
I've never seen that costume before.

2370
01:37:51,010 --> 01:37:51,910
Oh that's costume.

2371
01:37:52,070 --> 01:37:52,590
You should have it.

2372
01:37:52,650 --> 01:37:53,150
It's costume too.

2373
01:37:53,230 --> 01:37:53,550
I don't know.

2374
01:37:53,690 --> 01:37:56,890
If you got the deluxe I think it comes with it.

2375
01:37:56,990 --> 01:37:57,670
Oh my God.

2376
01:37:59,710 --> 01:38:00,070
So.

2377
01:38:01,710 --> 01:38:02,970
What do you do against fireballs?

2378
01:38:05,430 --> 01:38:15,710
So what I want you to do when you fight against any fireball character is you do back back special move and heavy.

2379
01:38:17,470 --> 01:38:17,950
Oh.

2380
01:38:19,830 --> 01:38:21,370
It's like doing the level 2 super.

2381
01:38:21,610 --> 01:38:22,090
Oh.

2382
01:38:22,090 --> 01:38:22,510
Okay.

2383
01:38:23,290 --> 01:38:23,770
Yeah.

2384
01:38:23,890 --> 01:38:26,390
So when you see the fireball do that super.

2385
01:38:26,730 --> 01:38:27,210
Okay.

2386
01:38:29,670 --> 01:38:30,630
Oh shit.

2387
01:38:30,670 --> 01:38:31,450
What the fuck.

2388
01:38:32,590 --> 01:38:34,470
So what I want you to do is don't hold.

2389
01:38:34,690 --> 01:38:37,610
When you do the level 2 super let go.

2390
01:38:37,770 --> 01:38:38,750
Don't hold it.

2391
01:38:41,630 --> 01:38:42,350
Oh my God.

2392
01:38:42,370 --> 01:38:43,810
I didn't even realize it sucks people in.

2393
01:38:44,430 --> 01:38:46,370
That's how little I use the super.

2394
01:38:47,070 --> 01:38:47,470
Yeah.

2395
01:38:47,470 --> 01:38:47,670
Yeah.

2396
01:38:47,730 --> 01:38:47,890
Yeah.

2397
01:38:48,370 --> 01:38:49,830
So anytime you see it.

2398
01:38:51,050 --> 01:38:51,850
Not that one.

2399
01:38:52,010 --> 01:38:52,410
Yup.

2400
01:38:56,490 --> 01:39:00,570
And it will do a chunk of damage if you don't hold it.

2401
01:39:00,610 --> 01:39:03,270
If you hold it it will do like that little Yeah.

2402
01:39:03,690 --> 01:39:17,670
A little cyclone thing where it doesn't do that much damage because you're supposed to combo afterwards but if you want to do something like that you can hold it and then right after I start flying in the air you do your level 1 super.

2403
01:39:18,050 --> 01:39:18,530
Okay.

2404
01:39:22,770 --> 01:39:24,130
Now do the level 1 super.

2405
01:39:24,310 --> 01:39:30,190
I am coming for you So it will look like that.

2406
01:39:30,430 --> 01:39:30,910
Okay.

2407
01:39:31,170 --> 01:39:34,130
But that's if you feel like wanting to do that but Yeah.

2408
01:39:34,270 --> 01:39:34,430
Yeah.

2409
01:39:34,490 --> 01:39:36,770
I want to clip a stream moment.

2410
01:39:37,930 --> 01:39:39,090
Clip a stream moment.

2411
01:39:39,390 --> 01:39:40,210
That's the one.

2412
01:39:41,430 --> 01:39:42,830
That is the one.

2413
01:39:43,430 --> 01:39:44,770
That's the one in game.

2414
01:39:47,010 --> 01:39:51,230
So Aki is really good at doing like moving forward like this.

2415
01:39:51,430 --> 01:39:51,790
Yeah.

2416
01:39:52,410 --> 01:39:56,750
So what do you do when you see players do this?

2417
01:39:56,850 --> 01:39:57,650
Do this.

2418
01:39:58,390 --> 01:39:59,410
Like drive impact?

2419
01:39:59,730 --> 01:39:59,910
Yeah.

2420
01:40:01,810 --> 01:40:03,330
So let's say do it again.

2421
01:40:06,250 --> 01:40:07,850
That's like why you have to be careful right?

2422
01:40:07,970 --> 01:40:08,130
Yeah.

2423
01:40:08,250 --> 01:40:19,310
What you can do is if you so remember how I mentioned in the beginning that some of your level 3's are like really good because you're using your eye and you're just doing it right?

2424
01:40:19,550 --> 01:40:19,830
Yeah.

2425
01:40:20,030 --> 01:40:24,290
So if you see the green come to you use the eye.

2426
01:40:24,590 --> 01:40:25,070
Alright.

2427
01:40:28,610 --> 01:40:30,250
I use my eyes.

2428
01:40:30,490 --> 01:40:30,990
Yeah.

2429
01:40:31,190 --> 01:40:36,290
So anytime somebody turns green and runs at you Yeah.

2430
01:40:37,030 --> 01:40:37,550
Right?

2431
01:40:38,650 --> 01:40:39,530
They cannot.

2432
01:40:40,150 --> 01:40:41,770
They cannot get out of it.

2433
01:40:41,930 --> 01:40:43,130
They cannot get out of this.

2434
01:40:43,170 --> 01:40:44,910
This is guaranteed every single time.

2435
01:40:45,170 --> 01:40:45,710
I see.

2436
01:40:45,790 --> 01:40:46,090
I see.

2437
01:40:49,350 --> 01:40:52,130
So you just have to remember that.

2438
01:40:52,270 --> 01:40:53,710
That's like the rule of thumb.

2439
01:40:54,670 --> 01:40:56,750
Also let's see there's this move.

2440
01:40:59,090 --> 01:41:02,050
So if you block let's say yeah just hold back.

2441
01:41:03,190 --> 01:41:06,070
If you block this you can press a button.

2442
01:41:06,550 --> 01:41:06,850
Okay.

2443
01:41:08,750 --> 01:41:10,110
You have to press.

2444
01:41:10,350 --> 01:41:13,450
When I mean press a button means press your fastest button.

2445
01:41:13,710 --> 01:41:14,110
Oh okay.

2446
01:41:16,210 --> 01:41:16,730
Yeah.

2447
01:41:17,450 --> 01:41:17,970
Yep.

2448
01:41:22,850 --> 01:41:26,710
Right and then now if you if you block this one.

2449
01:41:28,170 --> 01:41:28,710
Let's see.

2450
01:41:28,770 --> 01:41:29,070
Go back.

2451
01:41:29,150 --> 01:41:29,310
Yeah.

2452
01:41:30,750 --> 01:41:32,170
You cannot press a button.

2453
01:41:32,650 --> 01:41:33,130
Okay.

2454
01:41:33,250 --> 01:41:33,950
When you're yellow.

2455
01:41:33,970 --> 01:41:34,450
So she turns.

2456
01:41:34,590 --> 01:41:35,070
Yeah.

2457
01:41:35,170 --> 01:41:35,850
She turns yellow.

2458
01:41:36,010 --> 01:41:36,750
Don't press button.

2459
01:41:37,730 --> 01:41:41,030
But any other version you press button.

2460
01:41:41,390 --> 01:41:41,870
Okay.

2461
01:41:45,850 --> 01:41:46,330
Yep.

2462
01:41:47,810 --> 01:41:53,470
So now since you like to do the re-crouching punches right?

2463
01:41:54,230 --> 01:41:59,670
And then normally you don't have something like right now you have nothing to do after that.

2464
01:41:59,790 --> 01:41:59,970
Yeah.

2465
01:42:00,110 --> 01:42:03,530
So what I want you to do is when you see your three punches hit.

2466
01:42:04,190 --> 01:42:04,630
Okay.

2467
01:42:05,070 --> 01:42:08,970
Do three punches and then into drive rush.

2468
01:42:09,190 --> 01:42:10,290
Oh okay.

2469
01:42:12,150 --> 01:42:12,590
Right.

2470
01:42:12,590 --> 01:42:13,350
Oh no.

2471
01:42:13,610 --> 01:42:16,250
Yeah just tap the so you have to let go.

2472
01:42:16,330 --> 01:42:16,550
Yeah.

2473
01:42:16,550 --> 01:42:17,250
Let go.

2474
01:42:19,310 --> 01:42:19,750
No.

2475
01:42:21,670 --> 01:42:22,390
Come on.

2476
01:42:24,270 --> 01:42:24,910
Try again.

2477
01:42:24,990 --> 01:42:25,270
Try again.

2478
01:42:28,150 --> 01:42:28,550
Yeah.

2479
01:42:28,670 --> 01:42:30,070
So do one, two, three.

2480
01:42:30,130 --> 01:42:30,470
Let go.

2481
01:42:30,710 --> 01:42:31,770
One, two, three.

2482
01:42:31,810 --> 01:42:32,170
Let go.

2483
01:42:32,610 --> 01:42:33,930
One, two, three.

2484
01:42:34,370 --> 01:42:34,770
No.

2485
01:42:35,050 --> 01:42:35,450
Yeah.

2486
01:42:35,570 --> 01:42:35,750
Okay.

2487
01:42:39,410 --> 01:42:39,810
Yeah.

2488
01:42:39,810 --> 01:42:46,090
So what I want you to do after you do drive rush is go into the command throw.

2489
01:42:46,150 --> 01:42:46,690
The special move.

2490
01:42:46,790 --> 01:42:46,970
Okay.

2491
01:42:49,030 --> 01:42:49,690
There you go.

2492
01:42:49,990 --> 01:42:50,390
Yay!

2493
01:42:51,410 --> 01:42:53,830
So now let's try it again.

2494
01:42:57,450 --> 01:42:58,110
Oh shit.

2495
01:42:58,170 --> 01:43:00,150
I just wanted to kick you.

2496
01:43:02,070 --> 01:43:02,590
Oh.

2497
01:43:05,830 --> 01:43:06,350
No!

2498
01:43:06,590 --> 01:43:07,170
Come on!

2499
01:43:09,940 --> 01:43:10,760
What the fuck?

2500
01:43:10,980 --> 01:43:11,040
That's okay.

2501
01:43:16,380 --> 01:43:17,860
A little bit there.

2502
01:43:17,960 --> 01:43:19,400
We could definitely get more cleaner.

2503
01:43:19,740 --> 01:43:20,140
Yeah.

2504
01:43:20,640 --> 01:43:21,160
Oops.

2505
01:43:24,840 --> 01:43:25,360
No!

2506
01:43:25,360 --> 01:43:25,860
Come on!

2507
01:43:28,800 --> 01:43:29,320
Oops.

2508
01:43:35,380 --> 01:43:35,860
Boom.

2509
01:43:35,920 --> 01:43:36,660
That was the cleanest.

2510
01:43:37,220 --> 01:43:37,700
Yeah.

2511
01:43:37,700 --> 01:43:38,220
That was the cleanest.

2512
01:43:38,220 --> 01:43:39,140
That was the cleanest so far.

2513
01:43:39,280 --> 01:43:42,960
You can even do two if you want to do it faster.

2514
01:43:43,100 --> 01:43:43,700
Like that.

2515
01:43:43,940 --> 01:43:44,420
Okay.

2516
01:43:44,680 --> 01:43:45,160
Okay.

2517
01:43:49,080 --> 01:43:51,100
That one was almost perfect.

2518
01:43:52,400 --> 01:43:52,880
Oops.

2519
01:43:56,360 --> 01:43:57,200
There you go.

2520
01:43:57,560 --> 01:43:58,040
Yay!

2521
01:43:59,520 --> 01:44:00,000
Woo!

2522
01:44:00,380 --> 01:44:03,020
So that's really good as well.

2523
01:44:03,880 --> 01:44:04,500
Let's see.

2524
01:44:04,660 --> 01:44:09,160
The only other thing with Baki is probably this move.

2525
01:44:09,420 --> 01:44:09,920
Oh yeah.

2526
01:44:10,020 --> 01:44:10,740
Fuck that move.

2527
01:44:11,420 --> 01:44:12,380
The little slide.

2528
01:44:12,900 --> 01:44:13,900
You don't like this move?

2529
01:44:14,800 --> 01:44:15,280
No.

2530
01:44:15,280 --> 01:44:16,000
That's shit.

2531
01:44:16,860 --> 01:44:20,760
So if you see, let's say I'm going to use this move to get out.

2532
01:44:20,940 --> 01:44:21,360
Yeah.

2533
01:44:21,360 --> 01:44:26,240
If you think I'm going to use this move, just press when you see me turn yellow, press special move.

2534
01:44:26,460 --> 01:44:26,840
Okay.

2535
01:44:28,440 --> 01:44:29,600
A little faster.

2536
01:44:30,840 --> 01:44:31,680
Oh, okay.

2537
01:44:32,040 --> 01:44:32,560
Yeah.

2538
01:44:32,700 --> 01:44:34,960
Because it loses to grabs.

2539
01:44:36,040 --> 01:44:37,020
Oh, thank god.

2540
01:44:37,600 --> 01:44:38,120
Yeah.

2541
01:44:38,360 --> 01:44:39,820
So try to do this.

2542
01:44:39,960 --> 01:44:41,020
Try to do...

2543
01:44:42,920 --> 01:44:45,200
Let's say you do the down forward heavy.

2544
01:44:45,440 --> 01:44:45,840
Okay.

2545
01:44:46,700 --> 01:44:47,540
And then...

2546
01:44:47,540 --> 01:44:48,540
Not that one.

2547
01:44:48,620 --> 01:44:49,460
Down forward heavy.

2548
01:44:49,640 --> 01:44:49,840
Yeah.

2549
01:44:50,640 --> 01:44:53,800
And then press crouching light afterwards.

2550
01:44:56,220 --> 01:44:58,580
Yeah, like on my wake up.

2551
01:44:58,980 --> 01:45:01,840
Like when I wake up, I'll try to use crouching light.

2552
01:45:01,980 --> 01:45:02,420
Okay.

2553
01:45:05,880 --> 01:45:06,860
Yeah, keep doing this.

2554
01:45:07,100 --> 01:45:07,340
Yeah.

2555
01:45:08,080 --> 01:45:08,920
Smash it.

2556
01:45:10,060 --> 01:45:11,780
So it'll be something like that, right?

2557
01:45:11,920 --> 01:45:12,100
Yeah.

2558
01:45:12,840 --> 01:45:15,400
So once you see me turn yellow, you go for the throw.

2559
01:45:15,980 --> 01:45:16,420
Okay.

2560
01:45:20,540 --> 01:45:20,980
No!

2561
01:45:20,980 --> 01:45:22,000
Get back here!

2562
01:45:25,340 --> 01:45:25,780
Yeah!

2563
01:45:25,900 --> 01:45:26,340
Nice!

2564
01:45:26,340 --> 01:45:26,600
Nice!

2565
01:45:28,900 --> 01:45:30,240
So that works.

2566
01:45:31,020 --> 01:45:31,520
Yeah.

2567
01:45:31,640 --> 01:45:32,220
So if you could...

2568
01:45:32,220 --> 01:45:36,700
So if you think they're gonna try to slither their way out, always go for the throw.

2569
01:45:37,200 --> 01:45:37,720
Okay.

2570
01:45:37,980 --> 01:45:39,100
Just grab the...

2571
01:45:39,100 --> 01:45:40,080
Yeah.

2572
01:45:40,420 --> 01:45:44,240
Another thing you just have to watch out for is this... this stance.

2573
01:45:44,580 --> 01:45:45,900
What the fuck?

2574
01:45:46,080 --> 01:45:46,740
What is that?

2575
01:45:47,260 --> 01:45:47,540
Yeah.

2576
01:45:47,540 --> 01:45:50,660
Oh shit!

2577
01:45:50,820 --> 01:45:53,160
I think this is the first time I've ever seen that.

2578
01:45:53,160 --> 01:45:54,700
What the fuck?

2579
01:45:55,440 --> 01:45:59,720
So let's say, if you see them... if you see them do this, just hold up.

2580
01:45:59,860 --> 01:46:01,500
What the fuck is that?

2581
01:46:01,500 --> 01:46:04,220
Like, it's like Lily's command throw.

2582
01:46:04,340 --> 01:46:04,640
Oh, okay.

2583
01:46:05,260 --> 01:46:07,320
I swear I've never seen this before.

2584
01:46:08,720 --> 01:46:09,680
Just in case.

2585
01:46:09,880 --> 01:46:10,140
Yeah.

2586
01:46:10,620 --> 01:46:11,680
Just hold up.

2587
01:46:11,740 --> 01:46:12,080
Hold up.

2588
01:46:12,200 --> 01:46:12,680
Okay.

2589
01:46:12,920 --> 01:46:13,700
Hold up.

2590
01:46:13,700 --> 01:46:14,080
Okay.

2591
01:46:15,260 --> 01:46:15,940
Yeah, hold on.

2592
01:46:16,020 --> 01:46:17,360
When you block first...

2593
01:46:17,360 --> 01:46:17,720
It's just so creepy.

2594
01:46:17,860 --> 01:46:19,420
Yeah, block first and hold up.

2595
01:46:20,020 --> 01:46:21,180
Holy shit.

2596
01:46:21,300 --> 01:46:21,520
Yeah.

2597
01:46:25,920 --> 01:46:26,340
Yeah.

2598
01:46:26,400 --> 01:46:26,800
Yeah.

2599
01:46:26,900 --> 01:46:28,560
Hold up and not a direction.

2600
01:46:30,260 --> 01:46:33,560
And then remember the punish that you did against Lily's command throw?

2601
01:46:35,960 --> 01:46:36,380
Yes.

2602
01:46:36,380 --> 01:46:36,800
Yes.

2603
01:46:37,560 --> 01:46:37,980
Yeah.

2604
01:46:38,600 --> 01:46:39,580
Sorry, I buffed you.

2605
01:46:41,140 --> 01:46:42,540
Do the same thing.

2606
01:46:42,700 --> 01:46:43,120
Okay.

2607
01:46:49,680 --> 01:46:51,340
So you could do that as well too.

2608
01:46:51,420 --> 01:46:52,120
That's the same thing.

2609
01:46:55,680 --> 01:46:57,800
Alright, now we're gonna do the hardest thing.

2610
01:47:00,440 --> 01:47:01,480
What is it?

2611
01:47:02,240 --> 01:47:02,640
What is it?

2612
01:47:03,440 --> 01:47:04,840
We are going to do a review.

2613
01:47:05,560 --> 01:47:05,960
Oh.

2614
01:47:08,240 --> 01:47:10,140
I just wanna see how much...

2615
01:47:11,980 --> 01:47:12,380
No.

2616
01:47:15,500 --> 01:47:17,240
No, not the surprise quiz.

2617
01:47:19,340 --> 01:47:19,960
Alright, alright.

2618
01:47:20,920 --> 01:47:24,460
So, what do you do with the... what do you do with the headbutt?

2619
01:47:29,080 --> 01:47:29,500
That.

2620
01:47:30,100 --> 01:47:30,520
Yeah.

2621
01:47:31,020 --> 01:47:31,440
Or...

2622
01:47:33,200 --> 01:47:33,840
Or that.

2623
01:47:33,940 --> 01:47:34,380
There you go.

2624
01:47:34,540 --> 01:47:34,900
Yeah!

2625
01:47:35,960 --> 01:47:38,460
Alright, that's one.

2626
01:47:39,440 --> 01:47:42,560
Now, what do you do if you drive and impact me in the corner?

2627
01:47:44,160 --> 01:47:44,580
Oh!

2628
01:47:46,020 --> 01:47:47,040
I'm coming over.

2629
01:47:47,120 --> 01:47:47,700
I'm coming over.

2630
01:47:52,280 --> 01:47:52,740
I'm coming over.

2631
01:47:52,740 --> 01:47:52,860
Yeah.

2632
01:47:53,220 --> 01:47:53,680
Or...

2633
01:47:53,680 --> 01:47:55,180
Or I could do this.

2634
01:47:56,960 --> 01:47:57,700
Wrong button.

2635
01:48:00,500 --> 01:48:01,300
Get up.

2636
01:48:03,520 --> 01:48:03,980
Okay.

2637
01:48:04,520 --> 01:48:05,160
Get up.

2638
01:48:05,260 --> 01:48:05,480
No!

2639
01:48:05,800 --> 01:48:06,960
The time they're on!

2640
01:48:08,860 --> 01:48:09,580
You got it.

2641
01:48:09,620 --> 01:48:10,360
No, but you're right though.

2642
01:48:10,400 --> 01:48:10,800
You got it.

2643
01:48:11,100 --> 01:48:11,840
Get up.

2644
01:48:12,360 --> 01:48:13,340
There you go.

2645
01:48:14,140 --> 01:48:14,600
Yeah!

2646
01:48:14,600 --> 01:48:15,020
Yeah!

2647
01:48:16,360 --> 01:48:16,920
Alright.

2648
01:48:17,060 --> 01:48:22,280
Now, what do you do with this button into drive rush?

2649
01:48:24,760 --> 01:48:25,320
Oh.

2650
01:48:25,860 --> 01:48:26,420
Oh.

2651
01:48:27,700 --> 01:48:28,260
Wait.

2652
01:48:28,440 --> 01:48:29,100
Let me see.

2653
01:48:30,980 --> 01:48:31,540
Yeah!

2654
01:48:31,540 --> 01:48:32,180
There you go.

2655
01:48:32,420 --> 01:48:32,860
Yeah!

2656
01:48:33,880 --> 01:48:34,700
Okay, okay.

2657
01:48:36,880 --> 01:48:37,540
Let's see.

2658
01:48:39,860 --> 01:48:40,420
Boom.

2659
01:48:40,740 --> 01:48:41,300
Learning.

2660
01:48:41,420 --> 01:48:42,220
Do you remember...

2661
01:48:42,980 --> 01:48:44,580
Do you remember this one?

2662
01:48:44,600 --> 01:48:48,100
If you do three punches, then what?

2663
01:48:51,950 --> 01:48:52,590
Oh, wait, wait.

2664
01:48:54,130 --> 01:48:54,550
What?

2665
01:48:56,510 --> 01:48:57,270
Give me a sec.

2666
01:49:00,190 --> 01:49:01,430
What do I do after that?

2667
01:49:02,090 --> 01:49:03,790
What's the button that you press after that?

2668
01:49:04,070 --> 01:49:05,790
What's the button that I press after that?

2669
01:49:05,930 --> 01:49:06,510
Give me a sec.

2670
01:49:06,510 --> 01:49:06,890
The little...

2671
01:49:07,970 --> 01:49:08,910
The little knee?

2672
01:49:09,570 --> 01:49:10,390
Oh, shit!

2673
01:49:10,450 --> 01:49:10,710
Okay.

2674
01:49:11,570 --> 01:49:12,190
Oh, shit.

2675
01:49:12,230 --> 01:49:12,630
Wait.

2676
01:49:14,070 --> 01:49:14,490
Wait.

2677
01:49:14,590 --> 01:49:14,910
Give me a sec.

2678
01:49:16,350 --> 01:49:16,530
Medium.

2679
01:49:16,530 --> 01:49:16,670
Medium.

2680
01:49:18,730 --> 01:49:20,670
And then what do you do after the knee?

2681
01:49:21,210 --> 01:49:22,090
And then...

2682
01:49:22,090 --> 01:49:23,890
Oh, not that, but it's also yellow.

2683
01:49:25,270 --> 01:49:25,710
Okay.

2684
01:49:26,090 --> 01:49:26,890
Yeah, that's right.

2685
01:49:27,030 --> 01:49:27,490
You're not wrong.

2686
01:49:29,050 --> 01:49:29,870
And then...

2687
01:49:29,870 --> 01:49:30,590
Yeah.

2688
01:49:32,070 --> 01:49:32,910
There you go.

2689
01:49:33,090 --> 01:49:33,810
There you go.

2690
01:49:34,290 --> 01:49:34,730
Alright.

2691
01:49:34,970 --> 01:49:36,530
So now...

2692
01:49:37,330 --> 01:49:38,430
Yeah, I think...

2693
01:49:38,430 --> 01:49:38,970
I think that...

2694
01:49:38,970 --> 01:49:43,790
Yeah, that's literally the four things with Zangief.

2695
01:49:43,790 --> 01:49:45,130
Definitely, I think the...

2696
01:49:45,650 --> 01:49:47,210
Your favorite one is probably just...

2697
01:49:47,790 --> 01:49:48,510
Oh, yeah.

2698
01:49:49,430 --> 01:49:51,070
Alright, now I know...

2699
01:49:51,070 --> 01:49:51,770
That's like your favorite one.

2700
01:49:52,210 --> 01:49:54,370
Now I know how to do this.

2701
01:49:55,770 --> 01:49:56,290
Okay.

2702
01:49:56,350 --> 01:49:56,890
Oh, that's right.

2703
01:49:57,010 --> 01:49:57,470
There's one more.

2704
01:49:57,710 --> 01:49:59,050
What do you do...

2705
01:49:59,590 --> 01:50:01,150
If you just do dry brush?

2706
01:50:01,930 --> 01:50:03,270
What are you pressing?

2707
01:50:04,390 --> 01:50:05,390
I'm pressing...

2708
01:50:05,390 --> 01:50:06,490
Just dry brush?

2709
01:50:07,350 --> 01:50:09,490
If you do, let's say from here...

2710
01:50:09,490 --> 01:50:10,670
Dry brush...

2711
01:50:10,670 --> 01:50:11,970
Oh, I know.

2712
01:50:12,070 --> 01:50:13,010
I know, I know.

2713
01:50:13,050 --> 01:50:13,990
I fucked up, but I know.

2714
01:50:14,510 --> 01:50:15,050
Yeah, yeah.

2715
01:50:15,390 --> 01:50:16,530
Wait, I fucked up again.

2716
01:50:17,410 --> 01:50:18,590
Don't worry, I got this.

2717
01:50:19,310 --> 01:50:20,790
Don't press a button.

2718
01:50:20,930 --> 01:50:22,350
Just hold parry and then dry brush.

2719
01:50:22,930 --> 01:50:23,490
Oh, shit.

2720
01:50:23,630 --> 01:50:24,830
It's rock, paper, scissors.

2721
01:50:25,610 --> 01:50:26,690
Rock, paper, scissors.

2722
01:50:26,970 --> 01:50:27,990
Rock, paper, scissors.

2723
01:50:28,170 --> 01:50:28,570
Whoops.

2724
01:50:32,030 --> 01:50:33,370
Yeah, and then...

2725
01:50:34,610 --> 01:50:36,910
That, and then...

2726
01:50:38,130 --> 01:50:38,650
Oh, wait.

2727
01:50:38,710 --> 01:50:38,910
Sorry.

2728
01:50:39,010 --> 01:50:39,990
I did scissors again.

2729
01:50:41,890 --> 01:50:43,250
There you go.

2730
01:50:43,330 --> 01:50:43,630
Yeah.

2731
01:50:45,870 --> 01:50:48,030
See, you do remember.

2732
01:50:48,330 --> 01:50:49,010
Yeah, I remember.

2733
01:50:49,950 --> 01:50:51,370
Yeah, you remember this.

2734
01:50:51,810 --> 01:50:53,170
That's the most important part.

2735
01:50:53,450 --> 01:50:57,410
Okay, so now you have these five things that you learned from Zangief, right?

2736
01:50:57,490 --> 01:50:59,230
The five sequences of Doom.

2737
01:50:59,390 --> 01:50:59,730
Yeah.

2738
01:51:00,710 --> 01:51:07,470
So now, when you play online, you have to land at least three of them.

2739
01:51:07,890 --> 01:51:08,490
Okay.

2740
01:51:09,370 --> 01:51:10,650
At least three of them.

2741
01:51:10,670 --> 01:51:15,870
You have to land three of them, I would say, a few times, so it's in your muscle memory.

2742
01:51:16,350 --> 01:51:16,750
Right?

2743
01:51:16,850 --> 01:51:17,170
Because...

2744
01:51:18,070 --> 01:51:23,830
You know, like, if you know how to do this in training mode, it doesn't mean it applies in a real match.

2745
01:51:24,050 --> 01:51:25,590
Yeah, I agree.

2746
01:51:28,230 --> 01:51:28,630
Right?

2747
01:51:28,770 --> 01:51:30,390
So that's like the most important part.

2748
01:51:32,390 --> 01:51:37,690
So if you can do it in an actual match, I think that's going to help you a lot.

2749
01:51:38,350 --> 01:51:38,830
Okay.

2750
01:51:39,810 --> 01:51:42,210
I hope I can do two of them at least.

2751
01:51:43,050 --> 01:51:44,330
Yeah, I think two or three.

2752
01:51:44,390 --> 01:51:52,630
I think the standing light drive rush into the command throw, I think you'll do that pretty well.

2753
01:51:52,850 --> 01:51:59,270
I think even the heavy, the auto-heavy light, auto-heavy light, you were pretty consistent as well, too.

2754
01:51:59,530 --> 01:52:00,010
Yeah.

2755
01:52:00,090 --> 01:52:00,570
Yeah.

2756
01:52:00,990 --> 01:52:01,710
I think.

2757
01:52:02,350 --> 01:52:02,830
Yeah.

2758
01:52:04,130 --> 01:52:08,450
Do you remember what to do against the other characters?

2759
01:52:08,850 --> 01:52:10,470
Do you remember those a little bit?

2760
01:52:11,350 --> 01:52:12,510
I think so.

2761
01:52:12,990 --> 01:52:13,590
I...

2762
01:52:14,630 --> 01:52:16,930
Like if Lily flies at you?

2763
01:52:17,090 --> 01:52:18,090
Oh, yeah, yeah.

2764
01:52:18,150 --> 01:52:26,650
Level one or like, uh, level one or there's the drive rush or the jump and then heavy.

2765
01:52:27,790 --> 01:52:28,530
Yeah, yeah.

2766
01:52:28,550 --> 01:52:29,210
Level one.

2767
01:52:29,670 --> 01:52:35,330
Level one or block and then jump up if you think she will command throw you.

2768
01:52:35,830 --> 01:52:36,270
Okay.

2769
01:52:36,870 --> 01:52:37,310
Alright.

2770
01:52:37,430 --> 01:52:42,530
And then you go for the jump coming down, heavy, auto-heavy big combo.

2771
01:52:43,210 --> 01:52:43,650
Okay.

2772
01:52:44,290 --> 01:52:44,730
Alright.

2773
01:52:45,490 --> 01:52:47,950
And then, remember walk and block.

2774
01:52:48,390 --> 01:52:49,110
Walk, block.

2775
01:52:50,210 --> 01:52:52,050
Count, count, count two seconds.

2776
01:52:52,770 --> 01:52:54,410
Count two seconds, block low.

2777
01:52:54,570 --> 01:52:55,010
Okay.

2778
01:52:55,350 --> 01:52:56,430
I gotta time myself.

2779
01:52:57,190 --> 01:52:57,890
Yeah, count.

2780
01:52:58,030 --> 01:53:00,610
It's like how you were doing your sequence of like, get up.

2781
01:53:00,710 --> 01:53:01,150
Yeah.

2782
01:53:01,190 --> 01:53:01,490
It's the same thing.

2783
01:53:01,530 --> 01:53:02,830
Count two seconds, block low.

2784
01:53:02,910 --> 01:53:03,530
Count two seconds.

2785
01:53:03,530 --> 01:53:03,810
Yeah.

2786
01:53:03,810 --> 01:53:04,610
I'll be like, walk.

2787
01:53:05,350 --> 01:53:05,830
Walk.

2788
01:53:09,470 --> 01:53:11,030
At least it's not dash.

2789
01:53:11,170 --> 01:53:12,090
That's the most important part.

2790
01:53:12,090 --> 01:53:12,390
Yeah.

2791
01:53:16,710 --> 01:53:18,130
But yeah, I think.

2792
01:53:18,350 --> 01:53:19,030
How do you feel?

2793
01:53:19,810 --> 01:53:20,530
I feel.

2794
01:53:20,610 --> 01:53:25,610
I definitely feel like I gained more knowledge on how to cheese on Gief.

2795
01:53:26,430 --> 01:53:26,910
Yeah.

2796
01:53:26,910 --> 01:53:27,970
I definitely gained more.

2797
01:53:27,970 --> 01:53:31,110
That was the goal was teaching you how to cheese with Gief.

2798
01:53:31,270 --> 01:53:31,630
Yeah.

2799
01:53:32,350 --> 01:53:33,930
That was the most important part.

2800
01:53:34,010 --> 01:53:35,210
I just need to apply it.

2801
01:53:35,850 --> 01:53:36,390
Okay.

2802
01:53:38,070 --> 01:53:38,610
Alright.

2803
01:53:39,650 --> 01:53:40,190
Yeah.

2804
01:53:40,290 --> 01:53:42,510
I think that's it.

2805
01:53:42,930 --> 01:53:44,570
That's it for now.

2806
01:53:44,710 --> 01:53:46,510
I don't want to give you too much information.

2807
01:53:46,510 --> 01:53:47,810
I think like That's a good idea.

2808
01:53:48,050 --> 01:53:50,010
It's a good amount.

2809
01:53:51,670 --> 01:53:56,290
I'll definitely, if you have any questions, obviously you know how to reach me.

2810
01:53:56,410 --> 01:53:56,730

01:54:10,270 --> 01:54:11,130

We can't stop the headbutt.

2885
01:56:29,390 --> 01:56:30,290
We can't stop the headbutt.

2886
01:56:30,870 --> 01:56:31,670

Don't let me go, please.

2891
01:56:44,330 --> 01:56:45,050

Kill her.

2894
01:56:49,410 --> 01:56:49,690
Kill her.

2895
01:56:49,690 --> 01:56:50,310
Yeah!

2896
01:56:50,870 --> 01:56:52,210
Oh, I could have done the other thing.

2897
01:56:52,350 --> 01:56:52,590
Don't worry.

2898
01:56:52,650 --> 01:56:53,030
I'll bait her.

2899
01:56:53,170 --> 01:56:53,470
Don't worry.

2900
01:56:53,570 --> 01:56:53,970
Watch this.

2901
01:56:54,750 --> 01:56:55,510
Oh, you got it.

2902
01:56:55,610 --> 01:56:56,010
Don't worry.

2903
01:56:56,090 --> 01:56:56,590
Watch this.

2904
01:56:56,990 --> 01:56:57,730

2908
01:57:04,210 --> 01:57:05,170
I approve of that.

2909
01:57:05,230 --> 01:57:06,530
That's the stuff I like to do.

2910
01:57:08,830 --> 01:57:10,870
I'm getting her a false sense of security.

2911
01:57:12,330 --> 01:57:13,870
You made her feel like, Oh, look.

2912
01:57:13,990 --> 01:57:15,270
I can go in.

2913
01:57:15,950 --> 01:57:17,070
I have to think about it.

2914
01:57:17,070 --> 01:57:17,550
Yeah.

2915
01:57:18,670 --> 01:57:19,950
You're about to be silver too.

2916
01:57:20,270 --> 01:57:20,830
Oh shit.

2917
01:57:20,890 --> 01:57:21,930
I'm gonna be silver too?

2918
01:57:22,270 --> 01:57:23,910
Oh, she wants a rematch?

2919
01:57:24,030 --> 01:57:24,310
Nah.

2920
01:57:27,270 --> 01:57:28,430
Oh, that's toxic.

2921
01:57:30,730 --> 01:57:31,930
She said nah.

2922
01:57:33,590 --> 01:57:36,590
You're like, I don't want those free points.

2923
01:57:36,770 --> 01:57:39,630
I want a harder opponent to get my points.

2924
01:57:39,690 --> 01:57:40,790
That's why you did it.

2925
01:57:42,570 --> 01:57:47,350
I wanted her to see my rejection too after she asked for a request.

2926
01:57:47,890 --> 01:57:49,450
Oh shit.

2927
01:57:49,590 --> 01:57:50,510
Mirror match.

2928
01:57:51,150 --> 01:57:52,550
Alright, this is a test.

2929
01:57:52,910 --> 01:57:53,430
Oh, fuck.

2930
01:57:53,610 --> 01:57:53,850
Okay.

2931
01:57:53,970 --> 01:57:54,330
No.

2932
01:57:54,750 --> 01:57:56,350
No, he's silver.

2933
01:57:56,550 --> 01:57:56,870
Please.

2934
01:57:58,450 --> 01:58:00,110
He played Modern too.

2935
01:58:00,270 --> 01:58:03,330
He might have your guides open right now.

2936
01:58:04,390 --> 01:58:05,090
He might.

2937
01:58:05,290 --> 01:58:07,670
He might be watching your stream right now.

2938
01:58:08,070 --> 01:58:11,230
I have brought a lot of Modern Zangiefers.

2939
01:58:11,570 --> 01:58:12,830
Oh, you caused this?

2940
01:58:13,310 --> 01:58:13,870
Yeah.

2941
01:58:13,990 --> 01:58:14,910
Oh my god.

2942
01:58:14,930 --> 01:58:15,770
He's doing a thing.

2943
01:58:17,070 --> 01:58:17,930
Holy shit.

2944
01:58:18,450 --> 01:58:19,930
He did what I showed you.

2945
01:58:20,110 --> 01:58:20,450
Oh, fuck.

2946
01:58:20,530 --> 01:58:21,650
He's throwing me off.

2947
01:58:23,050 --> 01:58:23,670
It's okay.

2948
01:58:24,030 --> 01:58:25,490
It's a mirror of yourself.

2949
01:58:26,610 --> 01:58:27,870
It's a mirror of yourself.

2950
01:58:27,990 --> 01:58:28,790
Don't worry about it.

2951
01:58:28,910 --> 01:58:29,330
Okay.

2952
01:58:29,490 --> 01:58:29,670
Yeah.

2953
01:58:30,050 --> 01:58:31,050
Oh my god.

2954
01:58:31,050 --> 01:58:31,750
He's doing it.

2955
01:58:32,670 --> 01:58:33,550
Don't mash though.

2956
01:58:33,590 --> 01:58:34,110
Remember, don't mash.

2957
01:58:34,250 --> 01:58:34,730
Okay, it's fine.

2958
01:58:34,790 --> 01:58:35,090
He's dead.

2959
01:58:39,290 --> 01:58:40,310
Oh my god.

2960
01:58:40,370 --> 01:58:42,250
He has your stream open right now.

2961
01:58:42,310 --> 01:58:46,010
It's like, I just learned this from I just learned this from his stream.

2962
01:58:47,670 --> 01:58:48,110
Okay.

2963
01:58:48,230 --> 01:58:48,750
No, you got it.

2964
01:58:48,810 --> 01:58:49,230
You're up at the window.

2965
01:58:50,270 --> 01:58:51,830
Wouldn't this be funny if it works again?

2966
01:58:52,430 --> 01:58:52,870
Yeah.

2967
01:58:53,250 --> 01:58:54,190
Wouldn't this be funny?

2968
01:58:54,290 --> 01:58:54,730
Oh, fuck.

2969
01:58:54,750 --> 01:58:55,030
Okay.

2970
01:58:55,450 --> 01:58:56,230
You were close.

2971
01:58:57,310 --> 01:58:57,910
Don't mash.

2972
01:59:01,010 --> 01:59:02,150
Oh, that's a key right.

2973
01:59:04,190 --> 01:59:04,630
Yeehaw.

2974
01:59:04,630 --> 01:59:06,430
I'm fucked too, but that's alright.

2975
01:59:07,310 --> 01:59:07,750
It's okay.

2976
01:59:10,030 --> 01:59:10,910
Oh shit.

2977
01:59:10,910 --> 01:59:12,810
I'm putting false sense of security.

2978
01:59:12,990 --> 01:59:13,310
Let's go.

2979
01:59:13,850 --> 01:59:14,430
Let's go.

2980
01:59:14,590 --> 01:59:16,350
He could do the same thing.

2981
01:59:17,570 --> 01:59:18,590
Wait, no, he jumped.

2982
01:59:18,690 --> 01:59:19,430
No, he jumped!

2983
01:59:19,430 --> 01:59:20,510
You fucker!

2984
01:59:21,670 --> 01:59:22,110
No!

2985
01:59:23,130 --> 01:59:24,210
You're still alive.

2986
01:59:24,310 --> 01:59:24,530
Don't worry.

2987
01:59:24,670 --> 01:59:25,110
You're still alive.

2988
01:59:26,030 --> 01:59:26,910
He jumped.

2989
01:59:27,230 --> 01:59:28,210
That's so fucked.

2990
01:59:29,670 --> 01:59:31,450
What kind of side people are you?

2991
01:59:31,550 --> 01:59:32,510
We don't jump.

2992
01:59:33,610 --> 01:59:34,450
We don't jump.

2993
01:59:34,490 --> 01:59:35,370
We hold forward.

2994
01:59:36,190 --> 01:59:38,470
Alright, you have to jump.

2995
01:59:38,530 --> 01:59:38,950
You have to jump.

2996
01:59:40,910 --> 01:59:41,430
Nice!

2997
01:59:41,430 --> 01:59:42,010
Good job!

2998
01:59:42,170 --> 01:59:42,370
Nice!

2999
01:59:42,510 --> 01:59:43,710
I did that!

3000
01:59:43,930 --> 01:59:44,510
Yeehaw!

3001
01:59:47,210 --> 01:59:48,930
That was a really good reaction.

3002
01:59:49,210 --> 01:59:50,530
That's a key right!

3003
01:59:53,330 --> 01:59:55,490
Alright, I'll let you rematch me.

3004
01:59:56,640 --> 01:59:57,170
That's right.

3005
01:59:57,570 --> 01:59:59,490
Yeah, he gets the honor.

3006
01:59:59,850 --> 02:00:01,230
He gets the honor.

3007
02:00:01,430 --> 02:00:02,690
Oh, is he gonna quit?

3008
02:00:03,010 --> 02:00:04,270
You fucking pussy!

3009
02:00:07,250 --> 02:00:08,690
He was thinking about it.

3010
02:00:09,090 --> 02:00:09,670
Nice.

3011
02:00:11,630 --> 02:00:13,910
Wait, this move is actually so good.

3012
02:00:14,030 --> 02:00:14,730
What the fuck?

3013
02:00:14,730 --> 02:00:15,650
I told you, yeah.

3014
02:00:15,730 --> 02:00:16,890
That's the button.

3015
02:00:17,270 --> 02:00:18,650
He has an iron head.

3016
02:00:18,970 --> 02:00:19,510
What the fuck?

3017
02:00:20,510 --> 02:00:21,190
That's funny.

3018
02:00:21,650 --> 02:00:23,410
I didn't realize how good this move was.

3019
02:00:24,070 --> 02:00:26,470
Remember, blue is good, red is bad.

3020
02:00:26,670 --> 02:00:28,990
That move is always blue for you.

3021
02:00:29,250 --> 02:00:29,550
Okay.

3022
02:00:33,030 --> 02:00:34,490
Oh no, this guy's...

3023
02:00:34,490 --> 02:00:36,330
Maybe I shouldn't have accepted everybody.

3024
02:00:37,530 --> 02:00:38,190
Don't worry.

3025
02:00:38,310 --> 02:00:38,790
Akuma...

3026
02:00:39,750 --> 02:00:40,190
Oh.

3027
02:00:40,470 --> 02:00:41,450
Oh, that's why.

3028
02:00:41,490 --> 02:00:42,870
Because you accepted Wi-Fi probably.

3029
02:00:42,890 --> 02:00:43,290
Yeah!

3030
02:00:45,470 --> 02:00:46,350
Oh no.

3031
02:00:46,490 --> 02:00:48,590
His internet's not letting him play.

3032
02:00:50,090 --> 02:00:50,530
Alright.

3033
02:00:50,590 --> 02:00:51,250
You have to win this.

3034
02:00:51,290 --> 02:00:52,190
It's the rank up opportunity.

3035
02:00:52,510 --> 02:00:52,970
Oh god.

3036
02:00:54,850 --> 02:00:55,730
He bleeds.

3037
02:00:55,730 --> 02:00:56,890
He doesn't have much life.

3038
02:00:57,250 --> 02:00:59,190
So if you grab him like three times, he dies.

3039
02:01:00,050 --> 02:01:01,050
Please let me grab you.

3040
02:01:01,530 --> 02:01:03,810
My coach is asking me to grab you.

3041
02:01:04,030 --> 02:01:04,710
Oh god.

3042
02:01:06,870 --> 02:01:07,270
Oh god.

3043
02:01:07,270 --> 02:01:07,930
Remember, hold parry.

3044
02:01:08,010 --> 02:01:08,330
Yeah.

3045
02:01:10,550 --> 02:01:11,450
That's fucking right.

3046
02:01:11,610 --> 02:01:11,650
Okay.

3047
02:01:13,230 --> 02:01:14,430
Let me headbutt you.

3048
02:01:16,430 --> 02:01:16,830
No!

3049
02:01:18,690 --> 02:01:19,510
It's okay, it's okay.

3050
02:01:21,170 --> 02:01:21,690
Alright, yeah.

3051
02:01:21,770 --> 02:01:24,350
If you hold parry, you get back drive gauge as well too.

3052
02:01:24,950 --> 02:01:25,350
Yeah.

3053
02:01:26,810 --> 02:01:27,610
Mm, nice.

3054
02:01:27,810 --> 02:01:28,290
Oh no.

3055
02:01:28,310 --> 02:01:28,930
Don't do that though.

3056
02:01:29,170 --> 02:01:29,570
Yeah.

3057
02:01:30,150 --> 02:01:31,310
You're spending bar for that.

3058
02:01:33,630 --> 02:01:34,510
Oh my god.

3059
02:01:34,710 --> 02:01:35,530
He's fucking me up.

3060
02:01:36,230 --> 02:01:36,790
Alright.

3061
02:01:37,610 --> 02:01:38,610
New strategy.

3062
02:01:38,850 --> 02:01:39,170
Okay.

3063
02:01:39,270 --> 02:01:41,070
Jumping medium into auto heavy.

3064
02:01:41,510 --> 02:01:43,230
Jumping medium to auto heavy.

3065
02:01:43,630 --> 02:01:44,190
Fuck!

3066
02:01:44,250 --> 02:01:44,810
Oh shit!

3067
02:01:45,010 --> 02:01:45,970
Okay, I looked down.

3068
02:01:46,310 --> 02:01:47,610
Yeah, so you can get it started.

3069
02:01:49,190 --> 02:01:49,750
Oh.

3070
02:01:51,850 --> 02:01:52,410
Okay.

3071
02:01:53,470 --> 02:01:54,030
Oh.

3072
02:01:55,190 --> 02:01:55,750
Oh.

3073
02:01:55,750 --> 02:01:56,730
Almost, almost.

3074
02:01:57,750 --> 02:01:58,310
Oh!

3075
02:01:59,350 --> 02:01:59,910
Okay.

3076
02:02:00,290 --> 02:02:00,590
Okay.

3077
02:02:00,850 --> 02:02:01,350
Oh.

3078
02:02:01,950 --> 02:02:02,310
Oh.

3079
02:02:02,730 --> 02:02:05,810
Yeah, anytime you get a knockdown, you can go for the auto heavy stuff.

3080
02:02:06,210 --> 02:02:07,290
Oh no, now I'm tired.

3081
02:02:07,930 --> 02:02:09,170
Alright, wait for the fireball.

3082
02:02:09,450 --> 02:02:10,050
Or not.

3083
02:02:11,670 --> 02:02:12,030
Okay.

3084
02:02:12,030 --> 02:02:12,810
I'll wait now.

3085
02:02:13,550 --> 02:02:14,510
I'm forced to wait.

3086
02:02:15,050 --> 02:02:15,570
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3087
02:02:15,810 --> 02:02:18,750
Remember, when he throws fireball, you can do your level 2 back, right?

3088
02:02:19,070 --> 02:02:19,430
Yeah.

3089
02:02:20,290 --> 02:02:20,950
Oh my god.

3090
02:02:21,310 --> 02:02:22,210
Yeah, just wait for it.

3091
02:02:22,270 --> 02:02:22,990
He's gonna throw it.

3092
02:02:23,370 --> 02:02:23,730
Please.

3093
02:02:25,410 --> 02:02:26,690
Come on, don't you wanna throw it?

3094
02:02:26,770 --> 02:02:27,390
Throw it, throw it!

3095
02:02:29,230 --> 02:02:29,710
That's fucking...

3096
02:02:29,710 --> 02:02:30,330
That might be a little too late.

3097
02:02:30,390 --> 02:02:30,530
No!

3098
02:02:31,050 --> 02:02:32,450
He just watched!

3099
02:02:36,250 --> 02:02:36,730
Please.

3100
02:02:37,110 --> 02:02:38,310
My coach saw that.

3101
02:02:38,310 --> 02:02:38,590
Okay, jump.

3102
02:02:38,770 --> 02:02:40,290
Jump medium.

3103
02:02:41,310 --> 02:02:42,170
You're almost there.

3104
02:02:42,290 --> 02:02:43,030
No panic.

3105
02:02:43,390 --> 02:02:44,370
I feel so embarrassed.

3106
02:02:44,950 --> 02:02:45,710
No panic.

3107
02:02:45,850 --> 02:02:46,950
I feel so embarrassed now.

3108
02:02:47,250 --> 02:02:48,370
No panic, no panic!

3109
02:02:52,250 --> 02:02:52,730
No!

3110
02:02:58,520 --> 02:02:59,160
It's okay.

3111
02:03:02,340 --> 02:03:04,180
We were just learning Ray.

3112
02:03:04,320 --> 02:03:06,060
We were just learning Ray.

3113
02:03:06,060 --> 02:03:07,940
We just wanted to fight him again.

3114
02:03:09,080 --> 02:03:11,820
We just wanted to fight him again.

3115
02:03:12,700 --> 02:03:13,340
Whoa.

3116
02:03:13,540 --> 02:03:14,460
Hello there, sir.

3117
02:03:14,820 --> 02:03:15,460
Okay.

3118
02:03:17,180 --> 02:03:23,180
Yeah, if you block that double kick when you're blocking low, the second hit misses.

3119
02:03:23,500 --> 02:03:24,000
Okay.

3120
02:03:25,260 --> 02:03:30,040
Oh my god.

3121
02:03:31,460 --> 02:03:32,620
This guy knows what he's doing.

3122
02:03:34,660 --> 02:03:35,440
There you go.

3123
02:03:35,660 --> 02:03:36,120
Alright.

3124
02:03:36,680 --> 02:03:38,160
Yeah, you just have to block.

3125
02:03:38,500 --> 02:03:40,600
He's not grabbing you, so you shouldn't worry.

3126
02:03:42,200 --> 02:03:44,840
If you block, eventually an opening will come to you.

3127
02:03:45,060 --> 02:03:45,360
Okay.

3128
02:03:46,940 --> 02:03:47,740
That's fucking right.

3129
02:03:47,780 --> 02:03:48,160
Get closer.

3130
02:03:48,540 --> 02:03:49,280
Get closer.

3131
02:03:51,920 --> 02:03:53,340
You can't run forever!

3132
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:55,160
Yeah, there you go.

3133
02:03:56,340 --> 02:03:56,800
Yeehaw!

3134
02:03:57,880 --> 02:03:58,340
Alright.

3135
02:03:58,340 --> 02:03:58,580
Alright.

3136
02:04:00,960 --> 02:04:06,100
Don't forget about the standing light attack into the command row.

3137
02:04:06,100 --> 02:04:06,280
Please!

3138
02:04:06,940 --> 02:04:09,840
That's actually what I was trying to do, but now I'm running into fireballs.

3139
02:04:10,200 --> 02:04:10,680
Alright.

3140
02:04:10,940 --> 02:04:11,760
You can't parry.

3141
02:04:11,920 --> 02:04:12,400
I know.

3142
02:04:12,480 --> 02:04:13,040
Jump over.

3143
02:04:13,400 --> 02:04:13,880
Oh.

3144
02:04:16,620 --> 02:04:17,580
Round two.

3145
02:04:18,780 --> 02:04:19,260
Okay.

3146
02:04:19,820 --> 02:04:20,980
I can do this.

3147
02:04:21,480 --> 02:04:21,960
Okay.

3148
02:04:23,060 --> 02:04:23,940
I like this.

3149
02:04:24,020 --> 02:04:25,240
Oh, I forgot my cage!

3150
02:04:25,240 --> 02:04:26,600
What happened?

3151
02:04:27,520 --> 02:04:29,420
You spent a lot there.

3152
02:04:30,520 --> 02:04:31,040
Slap!

3153
02:04:32,180 --> 02:04:33,480
I didn't realize.

3154
02:04:35,660 --> 02:04:36,560
Get closer.

3155
02:04:37,140 --> 02:04:37,660
Fireball.

3156
02:04:37,780 --> 02:04:38,140
Level two.

3157
02:04:39,940 --> 02:04:40,460
Alright.

3158
02:04:40,720 --> 02:04:41,080
Ooh, nice!

3159
02:04:41,880 --> 02:04:42,700
That's fucking right.

3160
02:04:42,700 --> 02:04:43,120
Just block.

3161
02:04:43,200 --> 02:04:43,960
Hold back.

3162
02:04:44,020 --> 02:04:45,180
Never mind.

3163
02:04:47,740 --> 02:04:48,260
Alright.

3164
02:04:54,940 --> 02:04:56,320
Jesus Christ, please.

3165
02:04:56,960 --> 02:04:57,600
It's okay.

3166
02:04:57,700 --> 02:04:58,180
Level two.

3167
02:04:58,240 --> 02:04:58,600
Don't forget.

3168
02:04:59,080 --> 02:04:59,480
Alright.

3169
02:05:00,540 --> 02:05:01,560
Oh, not there.

3170
02:05:01,660 --> 02:05:02,780
What the fuck?

3171
02:05:03,260 --> 02:05:04,140
Okay, buddy.

3172
02:05:05,340 --> 02:05:05,740
Okay.

3173
02:05:09,900 --> 02:05:10,300
Almost!

3174
02:05:12,540 --> 02:05:14,500
You just need to get into the headbutt range.

3175
02:05:15,300 --> 02:05:15,700
Yeah!

3176
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:19,300
A little bit faster.

3177
02:05:19,860 --> 02:05:20,800
It was a counter hit.

3178
02:05:21,720 --> 02:05:22,120
Alright.

3179
02:05:22,520 --> 02:05:23,200
Just do it a little faster.

3180
02:05:25,300 --> 02:05:25,700
Okay.

3181
02:05:25,740 --> 02:05:26,460
You got level two again.

3182
02:05:27,300 --> 02:05:27,700
Okay.

3183
02:05:27,700 --> 02:05:28,340
Wait for it.

3184
02:05:28,820 --> 02:05:29,080
Oh my god!

3185
02:05:31,200 --> 02:05:34,680
I heard level two and my instinct went...

3186
02:05:34,680 --> 02:05:35,680
Press button.

3187
02:05:37,120 --> 02:05:37,880
It's okay.

3188
02:05:38,040 --> 02:05:38,160
It's okay.

3189
02:05:40,460 --> 02:05:41,460
Oh, Jesus Christ.

3190
02:05:41,820 --> 02:05:43,860
Just walk and block.

3191
02:05:44,560 --> 02:05:46,480
And jump over the fireball like Mario.

3192
02:05:47,840 --> 02:05:48,520
Okay.

3193
02:05:50,380 --> 02:05:51,400
Jesus Christ.

3194
02:05:51,400 --> 02:05:52,320
Oh my god!

3195
02:05:52,760 --> 02:05:53,440
Please!

3196
02:05:53,560 --> 02:05:53,920
No!

3197
02:05:54,080 --> 02:05:55,980
I'm so fucked up!

3198
02:05:58,620 --> 02:05:59,860
You almost had it though.

3199
02:06:00,740 --> 02:06:02,300
I think if you...

3200
02:06:02,300 --> 02:06:04,400
The only thing...

3201
02:06:04,400 --> 02:06:06,420
I think that there's no Akuma's.

3202
02:06:06,940 --> 02:06:07,380
Yeah.

3203
02:06:07,520 --> 02:06:13,280
The only thing you messed up was if you leveled two at the right time, then you would have won both of those matches.

3204
02:06:13,460 --> 02:06:13,700
Yeah.

3205
02:06:14,420 --> 02:06:14,860
Right?

3206
02:06:15,860 --> 02:06:22,780
It's just more you just have to get used to just seeing the fireball and then doing level two like in accordance.

3207
02:06:23,240 --> 02:06:23,780
Uh-huh.

3208
02:06:24,380 --> 02:06:24,820
Okay.

3209
02:06:24,860 --> 02:06:25,500
It's the same thing.

3210
02:06:25,980 --> 02:06:26,580
Yeah, yeah.

3211
02:06:28,040 --> 02:06:28,920
I'm ready.

3212
02:06:29,980 --> 02:06:32,060
I'm ready to fight the Pope.

3213
02:06:34,140 --> 02:06:36,480
Okay, but wouldn't it be funny if he doesn't block this?

3214
02:06:38,840 --> 02:06:39,860
We can't block it.

3215
02:06:39,860 --> 02:06:40,160
It's a grab.

3216
02:06:41,920 --> 02:06:42,540
Sorry, man.

3217
02:06:42,740 --> 02:06:43,500
Oh, shit.

3218
02:06:43,520 --> 02:06:44,360
I'm sorry, Ken.

3219
02:06:46,140 --> 02:06:46,940
I'm sorry.

3220
02:06:47,580 --> 02:06:49,260
I thought it'd be funny.

3221
02:06:49,280 --> 02:06:49,680
There you go.

3222
02:06:52,560 --> 02:06:53,300
No mash.

3223
02:06:53,460 --> 02:06:53,720
No mash.

3224
02:06:53,880 --> 02:06:54,140
Okay.

3225
02:06:54,200 --> 02:06:54,660
No more.

3226
02:06:54,660 --> 02:06:55,040
No more.

3227
02:07:03,560 --> 02:07:04,220
Oh, shit.

3228
02:07:04,260 --> 02:07:04,560
Okay.

3229
02:07:04,620 --> 02:07:04,940
Oh, shit.

3230
02:07:04,940 --> 02:07:04,940
Okay.

3231
02:07:04,940 --> 02:07:05,200
Oh, shit.

3232
02:07:05,200 --> 02:07:05,200
Okay.

3233
02:07:05,200 --> 02:07:05,620
Yep, yep.

3234
02:07:07,800 --> 02:07:09,600
Please, let me get closer.

3235
02:07:11,240 --> 02:07:12,660
You don't have to get close every time.

3236
02:07:12,800 --> 02:07:13,340
You can just wait.

3237
02:07:13,440 --> 02:07:13,920
Yeah, armor.

3238
02:07:14,100 --> 02:07:15,200
Remember the Drive Rush armor?

3239
02:07:16,020 --> 02:07:17,020
Drive Rush RPS.

3240
02:07:17,160 --> 02:07:17,260
Okay.

3241
02:07:18,160 --> 02:07:18,780
That's five.

3242
02:07:20,300 --> 02:07:20,980
You are safe.

3243
02:07:21,500 --> 02:07:22,240
You are safe.

3244
02:07:23,200 --> 02:07:23,580
Yeah!

3245
02:07:24,860 --> 02:07:25,240
Yeah!

3246
02:07:25,240 --> 02:07:25,940
Good job!

3247
02:07:25,940 --> 02:07:26,580
Yeah!

3248
02:07:26,800 --> 02:07:27,840
I did it!

3249
02:07:28,680 --> 02:07:29,520
It sucked!

3250
02:07:33,740 --> 02:07:34,880
Let's fucking go!

3251
02:07:36,920 --> 02:07:37,720
Oh, oh.

3252
02:07:37,940 --> 02:07:38,580
Oh, shit.

3253
02:07:39,460 --> 02:07:40,860
Spy, you're in grab range.

3254
02:07:41,600 --> 02:07:43,040
What if I do it again?

3255
02:07:43,880 --> 02:07:44,800
Keep doing it.

3256
02:07:45,220 --> 02:07:46,580
What if I do it again?

3257
02:07:46,640 --> 02:07:47,100
Oh, shit!

3258
02:07:47,260 --> 02:07:48,940
I should have rock, paper, scissors it.

3259
02:07:49,860 --> 02:07:51,200
Don't forget the Drive Impact.

3260
02:07:51,460 --> 02:07:52,100
In the corner.

3261
02:07:53,520 --> 02:07:53,960
Alright.

3262
02:07:54,280 --> 02:07:55,300
Alright, level one super.

3263
02:07:55,560 --> 02:07:58,560
Yeah, if it's airborne like that, you have to do level one super.

3264
02:07:58,860 --> 02:07:59,480
What the fuck?

3265
02:08:00,160 --> 02:08:00,740
It's okay.

3266
02:08:00,820 --> 02:08:01,800
You got level two again.

3267
02:08:02,320 --> 02:08:03,220
Oh, never mind.

3268
02:08:03,400 --> 02:08:03,840
You're good.

3269
02:08:03,960 --> 02:08:07,280
Yeah, the slap is really good.

3270
02:08:07,560 --> 02:08:08,500
Yeah, get out.

3271
02:08:09,400 --> 02:08:10,740
Oh, he didn't want to fight you.

3272
02:08:11,960 --> 02:08:12,400
Good.

3273
02:08:13,460 --> 02:08:14,340
Get embarrassed.

3274
02:08:14,920 --> 02:08:15,780
He was mad.

3275
02:08:16,820 --> 02:08:17,320
That's right.

3276
02:08:17,540 --> 02:08:19,020
I hope he finds this stream.

3277
02:08:28,560 --> 02:08:29,360
Oh, shit.

3278
02:08:29,380 --> 02:08:29,760
Oh, shit.

3279
02:08:29,880 --> 02:08:30,280
Oh, shit.

3280
02:08:30,280 --> 02:08:30,880
Oh, shit.

3281
02:08:30,880 --> 02:08:30,920
Oh, shit.

3282
02:08:30,920 --> 02:08:31,040
Oh, shit.

3283
02:08:31,040 --> 02:08:31,340
No,

3284
02:08:35,810 --> 02:08:36,450
it's a different person.

3285
02:08:36,570 --> 02:08:38,310
Yeah, his name is Copper Moth.

3286
02:08:38,750 --> 02:08:40,250
You got to take his streak.

3287
02:08:40,890 --> 02:08:42,230
Alright, Copper Moth.

3288
02:08:44,570 --> 02:08:44,970
Alright.

3289
02:08:45,330 --> 02:08:46,010
Oh, shit.

3290
02:08:46,390 --> 02:08:48,490
Oh my god, he's slapping.

3291
02:08:49,170 --> 02:08:50,610
Yeah, that's a good button.

3292
02:08:51,010 --> 02:08:51,410
Yeah.

3293
02:08:53,210 --> 02:08:53,730
No.

3294
02:08:53,910 --> 02:08:56,730
You pressed the wrong button.

3295
02:08:56,930 --> 02:08:58,950
Yeah, but I did it now.

3296
02:08:59,310 --> 02:09:00,410
That's fucking right.

3297
02:09:03,290 --> 02:09:03,810
Yeah.

3298
02:09:08,290 --> 02:09:09,410
That's fucking right.

3299
02:09:09,430 --> 02:09:09,750
Nice.

3300
02:09:09,890 --> 02:09:11,030
Yeehaw, get out.

3301
02:09:14,350 --> 02:09:14,870
Yeah.

3302
02:09:20,710 --> 02:09:21,230
.

3303
02:09:25,170 --> 02:09:25,690
.

3304
02:09:25,710 --> 02:09:26,310
That's fucking right.

3305
02:09:26,330 --> 02:09:26,770
I'm faster.

3306
02:09:27,470 --> 02:09:28,950
My APM is faster.

3307
02:09:30,330 --> 02:09:31,070
Not that one.

3308
02:09:31,110 --> 02:09:31,650
That's so slow.

3309
02:09:31,810 --> 02:09:32,150
Yeah.

3310
02:09:33,070 --> 02:09:34,010
That's a slow one.

3311
02:09:34,090 --> 02:09:34,750
No, shit.

3312
02:09:36,070 --> 02:09:36,810
That's your move.

3313
02:09:37,470 --> 02:09:38,230
That's my move.

3314
02:09:38,810 --> 02:09:41,620
I was on pause.

3315
02:09:42,640 --> 02:09:43,680
He's doing the thing.

3316
02:09:43,740 --> 02:09:44,980
The driving back in the corner.

3317
02:09:46,220 --> 02:09:47,840
Oh my god, he's just slapping.

3318
02:09:48,720 --> 02:09:49,900
You got to block the three hits.

3319
02:09:50,460 --> 02:09:51,720
Oh my god, he's doing the thing.

3320
02:09:51,780 --> 02:09:52,220
Look at him.

3321
02:09:52,740 --> 02:09:53,180
It's okay.

3322
02:09:53,180 --> 02:09:53,680
It's okay.

3323
02:09:53,680 --> 02:09:54,060
Okay, it's okay.

3324
02:09:55,740 --> 02:09:57,340
We're just both okay.

3325
02:09:59,300 --> 02:10:01,140
Oh my god, he definitely has your guide out.

3326
02:10:03,420 --> 02:10:03,820
What?

3327
02:10:05,020 --> 02:10:05,620
No, you're good.

3328
02:10:05,740 --> 02:10:05,820
You're good.

3329
02:10:05,920 --> 02:10:06,400
That's not going to work.

3330
02:10:07,220 --> 02:10:07,960
That's fucking right.

3331
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:09,560
You're right.

3332
02:10:09,640 --> 02:10:10,920
I let you watch too.

3333
02:10:11,360 --> 02:10:12,380
Get over here.

3334
02:10:12,540 --> 02:10:13,080
Oh, shit.

3335
02:10:14,480 --> 02:10:15,340
But not now.

3336
02:10:15,420 --> 02:10:16,020
Get over here.

3337
02:10:16,020 --> 02:10:16,560
I'm going to bait you.

3338
02:10:16,720 --> 02:10:17,600
Get over here.

3339
02:10:19,160 --> 02:10:20,780
Do some more damage for him.

3340
02:10:21,600 --> 02:10:23,180
Okay, now get over here.

3341
02:10:26,040 --> 02:10:27,560
Now get over here.

3342
02:10:27,580 --> 02:10:28,380
You know you want to.

3343
02:10:29,120 --> 02:10:31,140
Oh, he's so scared.

3344
02:10:31,840 --> 02:10:32,560
No, I don't make it do.

3345
02:10:32,560 --> 02:10:33,680
No, I don't make it do.

3346
02:10:35,600 --> 02:10:36,800
You have to be close.

3347
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:39,620
I played around with my food a bit too much.

3348
02:10:39,820 --> 02:10:41,080
I was just fucking around.

3349
02:10:41,580 --> 02:10:43,020
I was just fucking around.

3350
02:10:43,020 --> 02:10:43,640
I'm sorry.

3351
02:10:44,400 --> 02:10:45,180
It's okay.

3352
02:10:47,620 --> 02:10:48,980
Don't forget about the drive rush.

3353
02:10:49,620 --> 02:10:50,380
Oh no.

3354
02:10:50,780 --> 02:10:51,660
R.P.S.

3355
02:10:51,680 --> 02:10:52,080
No.

3356
02:10:53,380 --> 02:10:55,500
You chose Spock instead of R.P.S.

3357
02:10:55,920 --> 02:10:56,680
It's fine.

3358
02:10:56,780 --> 02:10:57,140
I won.

3359
02:10:57,600 --> 02:10:58,460
Okay, you did.

3360
02:10:58,580 --> 02:10:58,780
Slap.

3361
02:10:59,480 --> 02:11:02,860
I slapped harder than I ever slapped before.

3362
02:11:04,340 --> 02:11:05,540
That's fucking right.

3363
02:11:10,440 --> 02:11:11,000
No!

3364
02:11:12,180 --> 02:11:14,000
He fucking pressed triangle.

3365
02:11:14,740 --> 02:11:15,720
Yeah, right jump.

3366
02:11:15,760 --> 02:11:16,300
Oh, shit.

3367
02:11:17,540 --> 02:11:18,100
Remember.

3368
02:11:20,780 --> 02:11:21,980
You do the auto heavy.

3369
02:11:22,080 --> 02:11:22,560
Yeah.

3370
02:11:23,460 --> 02:11:25,100
Get the big combo.

3371
02:11:25,640 --> 02:11:26,440
Oh, fuck.

3372
02:11:26,620 --> 02:11:27,220
Okay, stop.

3373
02:11:27,700 --> 02:11:29,440
Stop slapping because I'll do it back.

3374
02:11:33,300 --> 02:11:33,780
Nice.

3375
02:11:33,780 --> 02:11:33,920
Nice.

3376
02:11:33,920 --> 02:11:34,540
Yeah, I'm faster.

3377
02:11:34,780 --> 02:11:36,400
I have faster APM.

3378
02:11:37,020 --> 02:11:37,720
Oh, shit.

3379
02:11:38,100 --> 02:11:39,620
Yeah, the range.

3380
02:11:40,120 --> 02:11:40,600
ODSPD.

3381
02:11:40,880 --> 02:11:41,800
We'll grab there.

3382
02:11:42,460 --> 02:11:42,940
Okay.

3383
02:11:45,040 --> 02:11:45,520
Nice.

3384
02:11:45,960 --> 02:11:46,440
Okay.

3385
02:11:46,620 --> 02:11:47,420
One more hit.

3386
02:11:48,380 --> 02:11:48,820
No.

3387
02:11:49,520 --> 02:11:50,420
Oh, shit.

3388
02:11:50,640 --> 02:11:51,080
No.

3389
02:11:51,820 --> 02:11:53,320
I couldn't get out.

3390
02:11:54,220 --> 02:11:54,660
Dropkick.

3391
02:11:54,740 --> 02:11:57,340
He fucking dropkicked me against the wall.

3392
02:11:58,580 --> 02:11:59,620
Remember the lariat.

3393
02:12:01,060 --> 02:12:01,800
Yeah, that's right.

3394
02:12:01,940 --> 02:12:02,360
If he jumps at you.

3395
02:12:03,380 --> 02:12:04,320
That's fucking right.

3396
02:12:04,400 --> 02:12:04,980
Do it again.

3397
02:12:06,700 --> 02:12:07,500
Do it again.

3398
02:12:08,780 --> 02:12:09,660
Oh, goodbye.

3399
02:12:09,980 --> 02:12:10,180
It's okay.

3400
02:12:11,220 --> 02:12:11,820
It's okay.

3401
02:12:12,940 --> 02:12:13,380
Yeah.

3402
02:12:18,760 --> 02:12:19,200
Yeah.

3403
02:12:19,620 --> 02:12:20,440
The lariat.

3404
02:12:20,520 --> 02:12:21,340
Don't forget about the lariat.

3405
02:12:21,480 --> 02:12:21,880
Yeah.

3406
02:12:24,800 --> 02:12:25,440
That's fucking right.

3407
02:12:25,500 --> 02:12:25,720
Do it.

3408
02:12:25,780 --> 02:12:26,260
Keep jumping.

3409
02:12:26,600 --> 02:12:27,420
Keep jumping.

3410
02:12:27,620 --> 02:12:28,540
You know you want to.

3411
02:12:29,720 --> 02:12:31,140
You could jump at him too.

3412
02:12:32,900 --> 02:12:33,340
Nice.

3413
02:12:33,820 --> 02:12:34,020
Nice.

3414
02:12:35,440 --> 02:12:35,880
Idiot.

3415
02:12:37,320 --> 02:12:38,320
That's fucking right.

3416
02:12:38,480 --> 02:12:39,380
Get destroyed.

3417
02:12:39,900 --> 02:12:40,380
Yeah.

3418
02:12:40,560 --> 02:12:42,660
Rock, paper, scissors next time when you land that.

3419
02:12:42,860 --> 02:12:43,340
Okay.

3420
02:12:48,240 --> 02:12:48,720
Okay.

3421
02:12:48,780 --> 02:12:49,520
But what if he doesn't...

3422
02:12:49,520 --> 02:12:49,680
Okay.

3423
02:12:51,280 --> 02:12:53,300
It won't work one day.

3424
02:12:53,680 --> 02:12:55,620
If it's the fast one, I believe it.

3425
02:12:55,660 --> 02:12:56,500
Not the slow one.

3426
02:12:57,660 --> 02:12:58,460
I'm throwing.

3427
02:12:59,000 --> 02:12:59,480
No.

3428
02:13:01,500 --> 02:13:01,980
Alright.

3429
02:13:03,180 --> 02:13:04,280
This is the comeback time.

3430
02:13:04,420 --> 02:13:04,700
Okay.

3431
02:13:04,700 --> 02:13:06,480
I won't throw this time.

3432
02:13:06,480 --> 02:13:06,880
I swear.

3433
02:13:07,660 --> 02:13:08,140
No.

3434
02:13:09,380 --> 02:13:09,780
Oh my god.

3435
02:13:10,020 --> 02:13:11,100
Holy shit.

3436
02:13:11,800 --> 02:13:12,620
Wrong button.

3437
02:13:12,820 --> 02:13:13,780
We gotta wait.

3438
02:13:13,900 --> 02:13:14,440
Oh no.

3439
02:13:14,560 --> 02:13:14,780
No!

3440
02:13:16,660 --> 02:13:18,660
The whole time I throw.

3441
02:13:18,900 --> 02:13:20,160
He thinks it's tactical.

3442
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:25,580
Okay.

3443
02:13:25,700 --> 02:13:27,080
I won't throw for real.

3444
02:13:27,440 --> 02:13:28,020
Alright.

3445
02:13:28,160 --> 02:13:28,280
Alright.

3446
02:13:28,520 --> 02:13:29,180
Oh shit.

3447
02:13:34,160 --> 02:13:34,740
Alright.

3448
02:13:35,960 --> 02:13:36,540
Please.

3449
02:13:36,540 --> 02:13:37,680
I can't throw anymore.

3450
02:13:37,980 --> 02:13:39,520
My coach says I shouldn't.

3451
02:13:40,220 --> 02:13:41,020
You guys jump.

3452
02:13:44,020 --> 02:13:44,460
Nice.

3453
02:13:44,540 --> 02:13:45,100
I like that.

3454
02:13:45,980 --> 02:13:48,520
You have like the read on what to do though.

3455
02:13:48,600 --> 02:13:48,740
Yeah.

3456
02:13:49,780 --> 02:13:51,040
When you do drive rush.

3457
02:13:51,140 --> 02:13:51,740
Oh that was great.

3458
02:13:51,980 --> 02:13:53,880
Drive rush into RPS not grab.

3459
02:13:54,280 --> 02:13:54,720
Oh.

3460
02:13:55,680 --> 02:13:57,360
Please stop slapping me.

3461
02:13:57,840 --> 02:13:58,280
Jump.

3462
02:13:58,560 --> 02:13:59,000
No.

3463
02:14:00,120 --> 02:14:00,840
That's your move.

3464
02:14:01,280 --> 02:14:03,960
That's my move but he confuses me.

3465
02:14:04,080 --> 02:14:05,140
I think you win.

3466
02:14:05,280 --> 02:14:05,640
Yeah.

3467
02:14:06,540 --> 02:14:07,580
Cause I'm like wait.

3468
02:14:07,800 --> 02:14:09,020
You can't use that.

3469
02:14:10,160 --> 02:14:12,100
That's the move I use.

3470
02:14:14,600 --> 02:14:15,480
Oh my god.

3471
02:14:15,520 --> 02:14:16,560
I hate when he does that.

3472
02:14:17,060 --> 02:14:17,500
Lariat.

3473
02:14:17,660 --> 02:14:17,900
Lariat.

3474
02:14:18,140 --> 02:14:18,480
Yeah.

3475
02:14:20,160 --> 02:14:21,100
Do that again.

3476
02:14:21,260 --> 02:14:22,080
Do that jump again.

3477
02:14:22,620 --> 02:14:23,140
Jump.

3478
02:14:23,140 --> 02:14:23,660
Nice.

3479
02:14:24,980 --> 02:14:26,460
Get predicted bitch.

3480
02:14:27,280 --> 02:14:28,080
Oh shit.

3481
02:14:28,160 --> 02:14:28,360
Okay.

3482
02:14:31,560 --> 02:14:32,340
Oh shit.

3483
02:14:32,720 --> 02:14:33,240
Okay.

3484
02:14:33,560 --> 02:14:34,200
Kill him.

3485
02:14:34,800 --> 02:14:35,320
Yeehaw.

3486
02:14:37,480 --> 02:14:38,020
Okay.

3487
02:14:39,960 --> 02:14:40,980
I'm scared now.

3488
02:14:43,780 --> 02:14:45,240
Wait that hits right?

3489
02:14:45,640 --> 02:14:46,180
Yes.

3490
02:14:48,160 --> 02:14:50,020
Told you I'd stop throwing.

3491
02:14:52,960 --> 02:14:54,300
Told you I'd stop.

3492
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:57,520
That was a good level 3.

3493
02:14:59,380 --> 02:14:59,920
Almost.

3494
02:15:00,460 --> 02:15:03,540
Like one more match away from dying to silver 2.

3495
02:15:06,740 --> 02:15:08,860
I think I could've got it if I didn't throw.

3496
02:15:09,480 --> 02:15:10,340
Yeah probably.

3497
02:15:10,660 --> 02:15:12,380
Two goals.

3498
02:15:13,160 --> 02:15:14,540
You gotta do the RPS.

3499
02:15:15,340 --> 02:15:17,840
And then the drive rush.

3500
02:15:18,160 --> 02:15:18,360
Oh.

3501
02:15:18,880 --> 02:15:22,000
The drive rush and you choose either Rock Paper Scissors.

3502
02:15:22,200 --> 02:15:22,560
Oh okay.

3503
02:15:23,100 --> 02:15:24,020
It's him again.

3504
02:15:24,500 --> 02:15:24,820
Hey.

3505
02:15:24,880 --> 02:15:25,600
It is him again.

3506
02:15:26,580 --> 02:15:27,580
Hey there.

3507
02:15:29,100 --> 02:15:30,720
Why are we still here?

3508
02:15:35,160 --> 02:15:35,720
Oh.

3509
02:15:36,860 --> 02:15:37,980
A little too fast.

3510
02:15:39,060 --> 02:15:39,540
Okay.

3511
02:15:41,380 --> 02:15:41,860
Oh.

3512
02:15:41,940 --> 02:15:42,280
Almost.

3513
02:15:42,800 --> 02:15:42,840
Oh.

3514
02:15:44,120 --> 02:15:46,440
I have to be back to neutral.

3515
02:15:48,180 --> 02:15:49,260
Trying to do it.

3516
02:15:51,200 --> 02:15:51,680
Nice.

3517
02:15:52,100 --> 02:15:52,640
Let's go.

3518
02:15:53,380 --> 02:15:53,960
It's okay.

3519
02:15:54,240 --> 02:15:55,240
It doesn't matter.

3520
02:15:55,400 --> 02:15:56,240
You did it though.

3521
02:15:56,360 --> 02:15:57,380
He knows though.

3522
02:15:58,640 --> 02:16:00,140
Alright go for the splash right here.

3523
02:16:00,220 --> 02:16:01,080
Jump over and splash.

3524
02:16:02,200 --> 02:16:03,080
Oh shit no.

3525
02:16:03,080 --> 02:16:04,360
That's not what I wanted.

3526
02:16:04,440 --> 02:16:05,520
The splash would've hit.

3527
02:16:06,700 --> 02:16:07,120
Slap.

3528
02:16:07,120 --> 02:16:07,540
Slap.

3529
02:16:08,640 --> 02:16:09,720
Oh shit no.

3530
02:16:09,900 --> 02:16:10,880
Oh that's gonna hurt.

3531
02:16:10,960 --> 02:16:11,280
Oh my god.

3532
02:16:12,140 --> 02:16:13,100
I'm fucked up.

3533
02:16:16,080 --> 02:16:16,920
Sir please.

3534
02:16:18,700 --> 02:16:19,120
Alright.

3535
02:16:19,240 --> 02:16:20,220
On wake up.

3536
02:16:20,320 --> 02:16:21,540
If you ever get knocked down.

3537
02:16:21,680 --> 02:16:22,640
I want you to just wake up.

3538
02:16:22,700 --> 02:16:23,300
And jump.

3539
02:16:23,500 --> 02:16:23,900
And don't.

3540
02:16:24,080 --> 02:16:25,220
It's that wake up button.

3541
02:16:25,580 --> 02:16:26,000
Okay.

3542
02:16:28,620 --> 02:16:29,640
I think he learned.

3543
02:16:29,860 --> 02:16:31,740
I think he was learning.

3544
02:16:33,080 --> 02:16:33,680
You're not supposed to learn.

3545
02:16:34,500 --> 02:16:35,280
Oh my god.

3546
02:16:35,360 --> 02:16:35,800
It's okay.

3547
02:16:36,180 --> 02:16:36,660
You're good.

3548
02:16:36,780 --> 02:16:37,560
You still got this.

3549
02:16:38,100 --> 02:16:39,680
You just need like three big hits.

3550
02:16:43,820 --> 02:16:45,100
Woah woah woah woah woah.

3551
02:16:46,640 --> 02:16:48,560
Don't forget about your headbutts.

3552
02:16:49,340 --> 02:16:50,540
But he also has modern.

3553
02:16:50,640 --> 02:16:51,980
He might look for the level 3 too.

3554
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:53,400
Wait.

3555
02:16:53,640 --> 02:16:55,360
The guy I played last time was classic.

3556
02:16:55,500 --> 02:16:55,940
Who is he?

3557
02:16:57,140 --> 02:16:58,940
This is the first thing if you thought.

3558
02:16:59,080 --> 02:17:00,160
Oh the first one.

3559
02:17:00,320 --> 02:17:00,940
Oh shit.

3560
02:17:01,080 --> 02:17:01,420
Okay.

3561
02:17:01,660 --> 02:17:02,140
Yeah yeah yeah.

3562
02:17:03,080 --> 02:17:03,860
I was like wait a minute.

3563
02:17:04,460 --> 02:17:06,700
There's like three Zangiefs that you fought.

3564
02:17:06,840 --> 02:17:07,580
So far.

3565
02:17:07,700 --> 02:17:08,400
And they're all different.

3566
02:17:08,840 --> 02:17:09,580
Oh my god.

3567
02:17:10,360 --> 02:17:12,680
I thought they were all just one giant Zangief.

3568
02:17:13,160 --> 02:17:14,020
No no no.

3569
02:17:14,540 --> 02:17:16,600
No wonder he played different.

3570
02:17:16,660 --> 02:17:17,580
I was like why don't you jump?

3571
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:20,700
Why aren't you doing the dropkick?

3572
02:17:20,920 --> 02:17:21,200
Yeah.

3573
02:17:21,420 --> 02:17:23,380
Why are you doing the stuff I did before?

3574
02:17:24,440 --> 02:17:25,660
I was like did you like...

3575
02:17:26,260 --> 02:17:27,340
Took my knowledge?

3576
02:17:28,040 --> 02:17:28,520
Oh yeah.

3577
02:17:29,820 --> 02:17:30,620
Oh yeah.

3578
02:17:30,640 --> 02:17:32,280
He's the guy that followed our guide.

3579
02:17:32,600 --> 02:17:33,200
Yeah.

3580
02:17:33,380 --> 02:17:35,680
He did everything that we were doing.

3581
02:17:36,120 --> 02:17:36,720
Okay.

3582
02:17:36,980 --> 02:17:37,580
RPS.

3583
02:17:38,380 --> 02:17:38,980
Okay.

3584
02:17:40,300 --> 02:17:40,600
No.

3585
02:17:41,860 --> 02:17:42,460
No.

3586
02:17:42,700 --> 02:17:45,540
Jump out.

3587
02:17:45,660 --> 02:17:46,340
There you go.

3588
02:17:46,420 --> 02:17:46,920
What?

3589
02:17:46,980 --> 02:17:48,080
Holy shit.

3590
02:17:48,480 --> 02:17:49,360
He's better.

3591
02:17:49,700 --> 02:17:51,540
He's just better I guess.

3592
02:17:52,100 --> 02:17:52,700
Alright.

3593
02:17:53,720 --> 02:17:56,040
You have to do level 2 on reaction.

3594
02:17:56,920 --> 02:17:57,360
No.

3595
02:17:57,680 --> 02:17:59,140
That would have worked.

3596
02:17:59,300 --> 02:17:59,620
Yeah.

3597
02:17:59,660 --> 02:18:00,280
That would have worked too.

3598
02:18:07,640 --> 02:18:08,080
Yes.

3599
02:18:08,160 --> 02:18:08,960
That was me.

3600
02:18:09,080 --> 02:18:10,280
I was like what color am I again?

3601
02:18:11,440 --> 02:18:12,480
You're the default.

3602
02:18:13,880 --> 02:18:15,560
I couldn't tell for a sec.

3603
02:18:17,160 --> 02:18:17,760
That's right.

3604
02:18:17,860 --> 02:18:18,480
Keep slapping.

3605
02:18:18,580 --> 02:18:19,160
Keep slapping.

3606
02:18:19,520 --> 02:18:20,720
That button is so good.

3607
02:18:20,740 --> 02:18:21,080
Get slapped.

3608
02:18:21,340 --> 02:18:21,920
Get slapped.

3609
02:18:23,120 --> 02:18:23,560
It's okay.

3610
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:24,660
That's fine.

3611
02:18:26,860 --> 02:18:29,080
If you get knocked down, just jump up.

3612
02:18:29,320 --> 02:18:30,000
Just hold up.

3613
02:18:30,080 --> 02:18:30,500
Okay.

3614
02:18:32,600 --> 02:18:35,060
Every time you press buttons, you always get hit on the window.

3615
02:18:35,660 --> 02:18:36,100
Okay.

3616
02:18:36,180 --> 02:18:36,720
Just jump.

3617
02:18:37,260 --> 02:18:37,700
Okay.

3618
02:18:39,120 --> 02:18:39,560
Oh.

3619
02:18:40,740 --> 02:18:41,180
Alright.

3620
02:18:42,160 --> 02:18:43,360
You have your level 3.

3621
02:18:44,120 --> 02:18:44,480
My.

3622
02:18:44,600 --> 02:18:44,920
No.

3623
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:45,980
He slapped me.

3624
02:18:46,400 --> 02:18:46,840
No.

3625
02:18:46,960 --> 02:18:47,440
He jumped.

3626
02:18:47,660 --> 02:18:48,340
You fucker.

3627
02:18:50,880 --> 02:18:51,320
Okay.

3628
02:18:52,540 --> 02:18:54,200
I already don't have energy left.

3629
02:18:54,340 --> 02:18:55,180
I might as well.

3630
02:18:55,600 --> 02:18:56,040
No.

3631
02:18:56,080 --> 02:18:56,340
You have.

3632
02:18:56,420 --> 02:18:56,560
You have.

3633
02:18:56,800 --> 02:18:57,240
Oh.

3634
02:18:58,420 --> 02:18:58,860
My.

3635
02:19:00,600 --> 02:19:01,120
That's...

3636
02:19:01,120 --> 02:19:01,440
What?

3637
02:19:02,980 --> 02:19:03,920
It's the armor.

3638
02:19:04,160 --> 02:19:05,620
It's the fucking armor.

3639
02:19:06,320 --> 02:19:08,840
How did you learn so fast?

3640
02:19:09,200 --> 02:19:10,440
I beat him before.

3641
02:19:10,480 --> 02:19:10,880
That's the button that you...

3642
02:19:12,240 --> 02:19:13,840
That's the button that you use.

3643
02:19:14,040 --> 02:19:15,420
That's the special move that you use.

3644
02:19:15,560 --> 02:19:16,000
No.

3645
02:19:16,480 --> 02:19:18,220
He used it against me.

3646
02:19:19,080 --> 02:19:20,820
You just have to...

3647
02:19:20,820 --> 02:19:22,860
When you see the arms go up, you just gotta jump.

3648
02:19:23,140 --> 02:19:23,640
Alright.

3649
02:19:24,720 --> 02:19:25,240
Oh.

3650
02:19:25,300 --> 02:19:25,460
My.

3651
02:19:25,640 --> 02:19:25,900
God.

3652
02:19:25,900 --> 02:19:28,240
Where did all these Zankeeps come from?

3653
02:19:28,840 --> 02:19:31,180
I guess they've been watching the last two hours.

3654
02:19:31,740 --> 02:19:32,740
They're like, wow.

3655
02:19:32,820 --> 02:19:35,200
I gotta put this into motion now.

3656
02:19:36,500 --> 02:19:37,500
Now that we...

3657
02:19:37,500 --> 02:19:38,280
I watched...

3658
02:19:39,100 --> 02:19:42,280
Justin teach Doki how to play Zankeep.

3659
02:19:42,380 --> 02:19:43,600
I'm gonna go into rank now.

3660
02:19:44,020 --> 02:19:47,320
You did get the standing light attack and drive rush into...

3661
02:19:47,320 --> 02:19:48,500
I did.

3662
02:19:48,740 --> 02:19:49,160
SPD.

3663
02:19:49,600 --> 02:19:55,880
So now you just gotta do the RPS where you just drive rush from full screen and just choose what you want to do.

3664
02:19:55,900 --> 02:19:57,140
Whichever heavy you want to choose.

3665
02:19:59,500 --> 02:19:59,900
Yeah.

3666
02:20:00,020 --> 02:20:01,240
I need to figure that out.

3667
02:20:02,640 --> 02:20:03,040
Yeah.

3668
02:20:03,160 --> 02:20:04,560
Just rotate it.

3669
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:05,960
Don't do it like that.

3670
02:20:06,100 --> 02:20:07,080
It has to be raw drive rush.

3671
02:20:09,020 --> 02:20:09,620
Oh wait.

3672
02:20:10,280 --> 02:20:10,680
Yeah.

3673
02:20:10,720 --> 02:20:11,560
Just raw drive rush.

3674
02:20:11,640 --> 02:20:12,120
There you go.

3675
02:20:13,840 --> 02:20:14,240
Alright.

3676
02:20:15,500 --> 02:20:16,580
Fight me opponents.

3677
02:20:20,940 --> 02:20:23,800
My chat is like Justin is mass producing Zankeeps.

3678
02:20:29,960 --> 02:20:31,020
That's a charge heavy.

3679
02:20:32,800 --> 02:20:33,560
That's good too.

3680
02:20:33,680 --> 02:20:34,880
You can use that as well if you want.

3681
02:20:37,460 --> 02:20:38,460
Get out of here.

3682
02:20:40,040 --> 02:20:40,660
Get out of here.

3683
02:20:40,660 --> 02:20:41,000
Get out of here.

3684
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:41,780
Get out of here.

3685
02:20:42,360 --> 02:20:42,800
Yeah.

3686
02:20:44,780 --> 02:20:45,700
That's the RPS.

3687
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:48,260
Get that RPS going.

3688
02:20:48,760 --> 02:20:48,780
Get that RPS going.

3689
02:20:48,780 --> 02:20:49,100
Get that RPS going.

3690
02:20:51,020 --> 02:20:51,460
Okay.

3691
02:20:51,600 --> 02:20:53,020
I gotta remember this too.

3692
02:20:53,600 --> 02:20:54,040
Yeah.

3693
02:20:54,120 --> 02:20:54,560
Three times.

3694
02:20:55,900 --> 02:20:56,540
And don't mash it.

3695
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:03,440
Yay!

3696
02:21:06,120 --> 02:21:06,560
Yeah.

3697
02:21:07,060 --> 02:21:10,460
All the games you won previously were all like from the headbutt.

3698
02:21:10,760 --> 02:21:15,060
I feel like the last few games you didn't go for too many headbutts.

3699
02:21:15,340 --> 02:21:15,780
Yeah.

3700
02:21:15,880 --> 02:21:18,560
I think I was just scared of the other geef grappling me.

3701
02:21:20,040 --> 02:21:21,880
I was like no don't do that.

3702
02:21:23,460 --> 02:21:28,680
The thing is if they block the headbutt and they try to go for the the grapple.

3703
02:21:29,580 --> 02:21:30,800
Your button will still win.

3704
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:31,440
Okay.

3705
02:21:32,040 --> 02:21:34,700
The only time you'll lose if they do level three.

3706
02:21:34,800 --> 02:21:35,520
Oh god.

3707
02:21:35,760 --> 02:21:36,720
It's a Blanka.

3708
02:21:37,140 --> 02:21:37,580
Alright.

3709
02:21:37,620 --> 02:21:38,620
Just wait for the Blanka ball.

3710
02:21:38,760 --> 02:21:41,600
Wait for Blanka ball.

3711
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:42,440
Lariat.

3712
02:21:46,760 --> 02:21:47,640
Oh shit.

3713
02:21:48,220 --> 02:21:48,660
Okay.

3714
02:21:51,180 --> 02:21:52,280
There you go.

3715
02:21:52,400 --> 02:21:53,220
Just wait for it.

3716
02:21:54,380 --> 02:21:55,240
And block low.

3717
02:21:55,380 --> 02:21:56,580
You can just always hold down back.

3718
02:21:56,580 --> 02:21:57,560
Remember hold parry.

3719
02:21:59,600 --> 02:22:00,060
Alright.

3720
02:22:01,220 --> 02:22:01,680
Oh.

3721
02:22:01,680 --> 02:22:02,660
Oh missed the armor.

3722
02:22:02,920 --> 02:22:03,220
Alright.

3723
02:22:03,280 --> 02:22:03,580
There we go.

3724
02:22:03,660 --> 02:22:03,940
Nice.

3725
02:22:04,560 --> 02:22:05,220
Play time.

3726
02:22:05,880 --> 02:22:06,340
Okay.

3727
02:22:07,800 --> 02:22:08,260
RPS.

3728
02:22:09,160 --> 02:22:09,620
Oh.

3729
02:22:10,140 --> 02:22:10,600
Alright.

3730
02:22:10,700 --> 02:22:11,040
Yep.

3731
02:22:11,120 --> 02:22:11,580
Hold parry.

3732
02:22:15,900 --> 02:22:16,360
Oh.

3733
02:22:19,620 --> 02:22:20,540
Oh no.

3734
02:22:21,860 --> 02:22:22,780
Get out of here.

3735
02:22:23,180 --> 02:22:24,200
Get out of here.

3736
02:22:24,420 --> 02:22:24,780
Okay.

3737
02:22:25,340 --> 02:22:25,800
Alright.

3738
02:22:25,880 --> 02:22:26,320
There you go.

3739
02:22:26,820 --> 02:22:27,560
Wait for it.

3740
02:22:28,040 --> 02:22:28,420
No.

3741
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:32,060
Oh my god.

3742
02:22:35,820 --> 02:22:36,300
No.

3743
02:22:36,300 --> 02:22:37,080
Get out.

3744
02:22:37,140 --> 02:22:37,540
Stop.

3745
02:22:37,800 --> 02:22:38,140
Stop.

3746
02:22:39,280 --> 02:22:39,940
It's okay.

3747
02:22:40,040 --> 02:22:40,240
It's okay.

3748
02:22:45,150 --> 02:22:46,210
Oh my god.

3749
02:22:46,830 --> 02:22:47,530
He's blue.

3750
02:22:47,590 --> 02:22:48,190
He's blue there.

3751
02:22:48,350 --> 02:22:50,490
If you block the rainbow ball, you cannot press the button.

3752
02:22:53,410 --> 02:22:54,210
Oh my god.

3753
02:22:54,230 --> 02:22:54,950
That was so slow.

3754
02:22:55,170 --> 02:22:55,990
I think I'm tired.

3755
02:22:56,670 --> 02:22:57,430
Are you okay?

3756
02:22:57,470 --> 02:22:58,130
I'm tired.

3757
02:23:01,710 --> 02:23:02,890
It's hitting me now.

3758
02:23:03,710 --> 02:23:05,290
It's hitting me now.

3759
02:23:05,870 --> 02:23:10,310
After two thank yous, I realized I was like, I'm tired.

3760
02:23:13,630 --> 02:23:14,590
Oh my god.

3761
02:23:14,590 --> 02:23:14,710
Yeah.

3762
02:23:14,730 --> 02:23:15,550
This is the last game.

3763
02:23:16,230 --> 02:23:16,750
No.

3764
02:23:16,870 --> 02:23:17,190
Yeah.

3765
02:23:20,130 --> 02:23:21,170
It's okay.

3766
02:23:21,290 --> 02:23:22,330
You learned a lot.

3767
02:23:22,530 --> 02:23:22,710
It's okay.

3768
02:23:22,710 --> 02:23:22,710
You learned a lot.

3769
02:23:22,710 --> 02:23:22,710
Yeah.

3770
02:23:22,890 --> 02:23:24,670
The fatigue hit me hard.

3771
02:23:24,790 --> 02:23:26,210
I was like, oh man.

3772
02:23:26,290 --> 02:23:28,150
Now I'm definitely too tired.

3773
02:23:31,050 --> 02:23:31,690
Slap.

3774
02:23:31,690 --> 02:23:31,990
Slap.

3775
02:23:32,470 --> 02:23:33,110
Alright.

3776
02:23:33,890 --> 02:23:34,210
Hey.

3777
02:23:35,930 --> 02:23:44,770
Just remember that like before the last three games when you were applying the stuff, you cooked those people.

3778
02:23:45,030 --> 02:23:45,250
Yeah.

3779
02:23:45,850 --> 02:23:46,170
Yeah.

3780
02:23:46,530 --> 02:23:48,090
Before the fatigue hit.

3781
02:23:48,230 --> 02:23:50,250
I think my coffee wore off there.

3782
02:23:50,430 --> 02:23:51,070
No.

3783
02:23:51,850 --> 02:23:54,330
I forgot to quit the match.

3784
02:23:54,910 --> 02:23:55,550
Okay.

3785
02:23:55,550 --> 02:23:56,950
This is the last game.

3786
02:23:57,110 --> 02:23:57,970
For real.

3787
02:23:58,890 --> 02:24:01,270
Maybe this person deserves the rank up.

3788
02:24:01,630 --> 02:24:01,890
No.

3789
02:24:02,290 --> 02:24:04,430
You deny the rank up.

3790
02:24:07,130 --> 02:24:07,650
Alright.

3791
02:24:07,730 --> 02:24:10,570
Just jump in splash and just go for the headbutt.

3792
02:24:11,370 --> 02:24:12,170
Oh shit.

3793
02:24:14,350 --> 02:24:15,110
Oh no.

3794
02:24:15,190 --> 02:24:16,130
I didn't check my gauge.

3795
02:24:16,450 --> 02:24:17,190
That's okay.

3796
02:24:17,310 --> 02:24:17,790
That is bad.

3797
02:24:18,950 --> 02:24:19,870
Jump splash.

3798
02:24:21,430 --> 02:24:21,950
Yup.

3799
02:24:22,250 --> 02:24:22,910
Uh huh.

3800
02:24:24,230 --> 02:24:25,130
Wrong button.

3801
02:24:25,250 --> 02:24:25,630
Yeah.

3802
02:24:27,270 --> 02:24:27,970
That's okay.

3803
02:24:28,470 --> 02:24:29,290
Hold up.

3804
02:24:30,130 --> 02:24:31,130
Just hold up.

3805
02:24:31,930 --> 02:24:32,490
No.

3806
02:24:33,690 --> 02:24:34,250
Stop.

3807
02:24:35,950 --> 02:24:37,770
I'm definitely so tired.

3808
02:24:41,070 --> 02:24:42,710
The fatigue has hit.

3809
02:24:46,990 --> 02:24:47,550
Yeah.

3810
02:24:47,610 --> 02:24:51,470
Anytime you jump up and they didn't jump up, don't go for the command throw.

3811
02:24:51,650 --> 02:24:52,150
Okay.

3812
02:24:52,910 --> 02:24:54,870
Only do it when they meet you in the sky.

3813
02:24:58,070 --> 02:24:58,830
I have enough.

3814
02:24:58,950 --> 02:24:59,170
Yes.

3815
02:25:00,810 --> 02:25:01,670
I had enough.

3816
02:25:01,810 --> 02:25:02,050
Alright.

3817
02:25:02,270 --> 02:25:03,170
Just wait for it.

3818
02:25:06,030 --> 02:25:06,390
Okay.

3819
02:25:06,390 --> 02:25:07,150
That's a good combo.

3820
02:25:07,690 --> 02:25:08,050
Yeah.

3821
02:25:08,850 --> 02:25:09,210
Oh.

3822
02:25:09,210 --> 02:25:09,610
Missed it.

3823
02:25:09,750 --> 02:25:10,350
Oh no.

3824
02:25:10,570 --> 02:25:10,730
Remember.

3825
02:25:11,070 --> 02:25:11,630
Hold up.

3826
02:25:12,310 --> 02:25:12,670
Oh.

3827
02:25:15,530 --> 02:25:16,030
Oh no.

3828
02:25:16,230 --> 02:25:16,710
Hold up.

3829
02:25:17,810 --> 02:25:18,170
No.

3830
02:25:18,170 --> 02:25:18,530
No.

3831
02:25:19,470 --> 02:25:20,070
I'm still alive.

3832
02:25:20,130 --> 02:25:20,390
I'm still alive.

3833
02:25:20,430 --> 02:25:20,790
One more chance.

3834
02:25:20,850 --> 02:25:21,270
One more chance.

3835
02:25:21,370 --> 02:25:21,450
I'm still alive.

3836
02:25:24,590 --> 02:25:26,190
I pressed triangle.

3837
02:25:27,170 --> 02:25:27,610
Yeah.

3838
02:25:27,610 --> 02:25:28,470
You have to press circle.

3839
02:25:28,610 --> 02:25:29,310
You pressed circle.

3840
02:25:29,430 --> 02:25:29,930
You would have been good.

3841
02:25:30,010 --> 02:25:30,930
I pressed triangle.

3842
02:25:33,410 --> 02:25:35,830
You have to ban triangle in the air.

3843
02:25:37,270 --> 02:25:38,970
It's because I was tired.

3844
02:25:40,410 --> 02:25:40,850
Excuse me.

3845
02:25:41,810 --> 02:25:43,450
Ban triangle in the air.

3846
02:25:45,950 --> 02:25:46,830
Ban triangle.

3847
02:25:47,050 --> 02:25:48,130
The fatigue hit.

3848
02:25:50,010 --> 02:25:52,270
I think you learned a lot though.

3849
02:25:52,330 --> 02:25:52,610
Yeah.

3850
02:25:52,910 --> 02:25:56,470
It obviously showed before you got tired.

3851
02:25:56,670 --> 02:25:57,130
Yeah.

3852
02:25:57,730 --> 02:25:59,650
It hit like a truck.

3853
02:26:02,310 --> 02:26:06,010
Those two Zankees back to back took me out.

3854
02:26:08,630 --> 02:26:09,190
Okay.

3855
02:26:09,590 --> 02:26:10,710
Oh my god.

3856
02:26:10,830 --> 02:26:13,650
But that was a very informative coaching session.

3857
02:26:13,850 --> 02:26:15,070
I definitely learned a lot.

3858
02:26:15,650 --> 02:26:16,390
Oh yeah.

3859
02:26:16,430 --> 02:26:17,070
It was really fun.

3860
02:26:17,130 --> 02:26:17,330
Yeah.

3861
02:26:17,430 --> 02:26:18,350
I had a great time.

3862
02:26:18,490 --> 02:26:20,350
Thank you so much for coaching me.

3863
02:26:20,710 --> 02:26:21,490
Of course.

3864
02:26:21,550 --> 02:26:21,890
Anytime.

3865
02:26:22,110 --> 02:26:24,490
And good luck.

3866
02:26:24,610 --> 02:26:26,310
I think it was Wednesday, right?

3867
02:26:26,450 --> 02:26:26,690
Yeah.

3868
02:26:26,690 --> 02:26:26,990
Yeah.

3869
02:26:27,030 --> 02:26:27,670
First round.

3870
02:26:27,890 --> 02:26:28,330
Alright.

3871
02:26:29,170 --> 02:26:29,610
Alright.

3872
02:26:29,650 --> 02:26:30,110
Good luck.

3873
02:26:30,290 --> 02:26:31,190
Thank you.

3874
02:26:31,270 --> 02:26:31,910
Thank you.

3875
02:26:31,970 --> 02:26:32,290
No problem.

3876
02:26:32,510 --> 02:26:36,450
Now we have a great time coaching everybody but the other beginner division players.

3877
02:26:36,830 --> 02:26:37,190
Okay.

3878
02:26:37,310 --> 02:26:37,750
Alright.

3879
02:26:39,630 --> 02:26:41,850
I will be watching anyway.

3880
02:26:41,950 --> 02:26:42,730
I'll talk to you later.

3881
02:26:42,930 --> 02:26:43,250
Yeah.

3882
02:26:43,250 --> 02:26:43,450
Yeah.

3883
02:26:43,830 --> 02:26:44,270
GG's.

3884
02:26:44,470 --> 02:26:44,910
