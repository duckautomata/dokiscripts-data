00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,160
Hello

2
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:29,680
Let us know it how are how our mic sounds everything is really everything we have no intro I didn't realize I brought in I forgot I brought a Laptop and then because it's a we're in my hotel room because it's a new sorry It's Atlanta.

3
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:33,620
What the... what is going on guys?

4
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,200
That's not...

5
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:37,920
Okay, if our mic is too loud, let us know.

6
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:40,780
Or too quiet.

7
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:41,640
Or too quiet.

8
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:42,980
Oh, is it lagging?

9
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:44,420
Oh my god, is it lagging already?

10
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,000
There's no way.

11
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:47,320
Are we actually lagging?

12
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:48,340
I think we're fine.

13
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:48,860
I don't know.

14
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:49,620
Everybody's saying hello.

15
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,040
Hello.

16
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:50,620
They are.

17
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,260
They are.

18
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:54,020
Oh, they're like Atlanta Internet.

19
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:56,420
Wait, how bad is it guys?

20
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:57,600
How bad is the internet?

21
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:58,700
Are we buffering?

22
00:00:59,500 --> 00:00:59,840
Guys?

23
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,280
Are we actually lagging?

24
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:03,780
It's good now?

25
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:04,760
Okay, that's good.

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,600
It's quiet.

27
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:06,940
Okay, we're using...

28
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:14,640
We didn't realize that like, um, this hotel room had no Ethernet port at all.

29
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:17,040
So we were like, what the fuck do we do?

30
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,160
We just...

31
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,360
It's a slight buffer.

32
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,580
Okay, well, we can...

33
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:24,160
We're gonna...

34
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,020
Oh, it died?

35
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:26,040
We'll lower the buff.

36
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:27,100
We're gonna lower the bitrate.

37
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,420
We will lower...

38
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,120
We will lower bitrate.

39
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:33,380
LMAO.

40
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:34,020
LMAO.

41
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,260
I'll lower the bitrate right now.

42
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,640
What if we do 2000?

43
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,140
Is that good?

44
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,740
Why am I getting an ad for a stream if it's that bad?

45
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:45,740
I don't know.

46
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:49,340
Wait, if I lower the bitrate now, does it affect it?

47
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,640
I don't know.

48
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:55,100
Does it affect it if I lower the bitrate on stream?

49
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:56,380
Or do I need to restart stream?

50
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:57,420
I don't know.

51
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:58,860
I have fucking no idea.

52
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,220
Okay, I'll do 1500.

53
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:04,640
Guys, you don't need us to be super quality, visually, because there's nothing going on.

54
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:07,380
It's alright.

55
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,860
So, basically, like we said...

56
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:12,940
No, it's just spinning.

57
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:13,880
It's just spinning.

58
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:14,960
Yeah, it goes from zero.

59
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:16,020
Yeah.

60
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,340
It goes like zero from that.

61
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:20,820
Alright, guys, what if I do 500 bitrate?

62
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:27,720
Wait, what would our stream be if I do like 500?

63
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:30,000
What would the stream quality be?

64
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,540
Would our voice be distorted too?

65
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,420
Would our voice be distorted with 500?

66
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,000
Guys, our bitrate's at 500.

67
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:38,880
I'm curious.

68
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:42,340
I'm curious as to see like what...

69
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:46,440
What if I streamed at the studio?

70
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,680
At the venue.

71
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,360
Do you think it's going down because of the bitrate?

72
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:00,500
No.

73
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:04,020
Because the bitrate's the one that's keeping everything together.

74
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:05,560
Okay.

75
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,420
I'm on my dick now.

76
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,020
Let's see if I'm on my dick now.

77
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,120
Let's see if it works.

78
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:15,840
Okay, guys, we're... that... we are back.

79
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:16,920
We're not back.

80
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:17,940
We are back.

81
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,140
We are not back.

82
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,300
That means consistent now.

83
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,120
Maybe just keep it.

84
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,120
We'll keep it here.

85
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:29,900
We're back.

86
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,940
We're not back.

87
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:31,480
We're back.

88
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,300
We're not back.

89
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:32,800
We're back.

90
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:33,600
We're not back.

91
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,160
We're back.

92
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:34,540
We're back.

93
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:34,940
We're not back.

94
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,260
We're so back.

95
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,420
We're so back!

96
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,780
Oh, it's so over!

97
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,280
It's nooo!

98
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,980
This is gonna be the fucking weirdest VOD.

99
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:43,520
I know!

100
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,560
It's gonna be like us, we'll be like...

101
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,060
Oh, we're not back!

102
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,520
I'm on my data now, guys.

103
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:52,740
We're on my data.

104
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:56,320
We're also on 500 bitrate too, so we'll see how this goes.

105
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,940
I bet you the visual is gonna be so funny.

106
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:00,880
How crunchy are we, guys?

107
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,200
Are we crunchy, guys?

108
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,240
I mean, it's consistent and stable now, because I'm on my data.

109
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,240
I think we just have to be on my data.

110
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,640
We're back, we're perfect.

111
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,140
Okay, so...

112
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:14,380
By the way, we're on my data, so I don't know how fucking...

113
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:15,820
Is it really crunchy?

114
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,000
It's...

115
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,120
It looks...

116
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,120
How does it look like?

117
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:21,920
Oh, I'm too...

118
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,820
Let's see.

119
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,920
How does it look like?

120
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:24,960
How crunchy is it?

121
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,660
Oh, it's fine!

122
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,580
It's okay now.

123
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:31,520
No...

124
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,580
Wait, there's no way.

125
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,080
I'm getting an ad.

126
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,400
Oh, you're getting an ad?

127
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,540
It's not bad.

128
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,960
Oh, I think you just fucking...

129
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,800
Audio's good though?

130
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:42,100
Oh, yeah.

131
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:42,740
Oh, that's fine.

132
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,340
Okay, guys.

133
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:43,560
It's not bad.

134
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:44,360
It's not bad.

135
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:44,880
It's not bad.

136
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,120
Well, you're looking at your phone too, so...

137
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,520
So, I'm on my data now.

138
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,300
I hope my cellular plan doesn't throttle me.

139
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,820
But Minthe's tired, I'm tired, we danced.

140
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,360
I'm so tired.

141
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:59,300
We danced, I played Marvel Rivals.

142
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,600
I'm not.

143
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:06,660
Yeah.

144
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:11,860
I played Marvel Rivals in the concert.

145
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:14,060
Just slapping my back like a baby.

146
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,120
Cop, baby, cop.

147
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,840
Yes, I won.

148
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:22,540
I won.

149
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,540
Minthe had to watch that entire game.

150
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:25,440
Good job.

151
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,640
Thank you.

152
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:27,760
Thank you.

153
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,760
Shout out to the animators...

154
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:39,260
Ramen and Tito for doing the animation together in two days.

155
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,640
Because I was like, hey, can I play Marvel Rivals on stage?

156
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,820
To feed my addiction.

157
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:49,010
And then...

158
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:56,960
And then they actually let me...

159
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,320
Put the animation stuff together.

160
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,960
Oh, there's the latency.

161
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:08,120
Wait, what?

162
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:09,100
What latency?

163
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:10,400
It keeps lagging, apparently.

164
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:11,620
Wait, is it lagging?

165
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:12,080
Is it?

166
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:12,920
I don't know.

167
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:14,280
I don't know.

168
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,500
I don't know if it's...

169
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,300
It's keeping everything...

170
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:20,560
What?

171
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:21,940
I don't even know what they're saying.

172
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,300
Only four seconds?

173
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,520
Wait, what does that mean?

174
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,940
It's stable now.

175
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,500
Just a bit choppy.

176
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:29,760
It's fine now.

177
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:30,600
Yeah, sorry.

178
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,600
We didn't realize how bad the hotel...

179
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,360
We didn't have a lot of time to do anything.

180
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:35,260
No.

181
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,080
We didn't have time to test anything.

182
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,660
Sorry, we went straight from the venue to here.

183
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,060
Yeah, because we were like, let's just do it at the hotel room.

184
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,560
What is Rice not saying?

185
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,480
I don't know.

186
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,940
There is...

187
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:52,520
So yeah, I'm on my phone data.

188
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:55,420
Anyway...

189
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,520
Just so you guys know...

190
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:01,140
Last cup of coffee was Mint's suggestion.

191
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:05,600
There was another song we wanted to do, but we couldn't.

192
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,400
I don't remember what that song was.

193
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:09,580
I think we were thinking...

194
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,480
We were trying to think of another duo and I was like...

195
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:16,040
Yeah, but then we wanted to do this one song, but then we couldn't because of the licensing.

196
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,280
I think it was Bad Apple.

197
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,840
Oh yeah, we wanted to do Bad...

198
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,480
Yeah, we were going to do Bad Apple.

199
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,080
But we couldn't because of licensing.

200
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,760
And Mint was like, I know this is crazy, but why don't we do Last Cup of Coffee?

201
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:30,160
And I was like, oh my god, fuck it.

202
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,060
You're welcome, I guess.

203
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:35,920
It was her suggestion.

204
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:37,460
Everyone was like, I can't believe...

205
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:38,200
Oh my god, Doki.

206
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,980
That's so fucking wild that you actually...

207
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,360
And I was like, I didn't even pick that song.

208
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,000
I wanted to make you guys cry.

209
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,740
And then right after...

210
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:55,200
I was dying when you were doing that because I was just like, it is the absolute most whiplash.

211
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:57,740
Yeah, the most emotional song ever.

212
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,500
That was also...

213
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,520
When you chose that, it was my first time hearing that song.

214
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:12,900
And I would sometimes want to sing that one and also the...

215
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:19,060
Because it would be stuck in my head, so I wanted to sing it on stream and I was like, no, I can't.

216
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:22,440
Because people would be like, why is Minto suddenly singing these songs?

217
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,860
I already forgot.

218
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:33,920
Our brains are mush.

219
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,180
Our brains are so fried now.

220
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:40,060
I also like...

221
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:41,260
Oh, yeah.

222
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:45,420
No, when we were...

223
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:50,720
When we met up last time for the tech stuff, we were just like...

224
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,520
The whole time we were just sitting around, we would be like...

225
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,120
Oh,

226
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,280
my God.

227
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:12,660
Yeah, so we will be posting videos of two performances, each of us.

228
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,400
Like, solo, duet.

229
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,040
And then, so each of us, my first...

230
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,320
I'll tell you guys which ones I'm posting.

231
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:21,640
I'm posting Last Cup of Coffee and FNAF.

232
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,140
I'm hearing the FNAF.

233
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,560
The emotional whiplash.

234
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:27,360
Yeah, yeah.

235
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:30,360
And then, Min hasn't decided hers.

236
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:30,740
No.

237
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:36,620
And then, we asked if Doobie could post the song she did with us.

238
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:37,080
Yeah.

239
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:37,820
And like...

240
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,120
Because we requested that, too.

241
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:39,720
Yeah.

242
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,980
Because we figured that should be a song to be posted online.

243
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,660
I was the one that suggested the song.

244
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:44,980
Yeah.

245
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,600
I remember when we gave them the song choice for the trio.

246
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,080
And then, they thought Min suggested it.

247
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:52,260
I was like, no, I...

248
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,040
Because it was like...

249
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:53,840
Yeah, you had a couple.

250
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:56,300
And I was just like, we should do the Sugar song.

251
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:57,420
Yeah, because it was like...

252
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:58,580
I was like, it's so...

253
00:09:58,580 --> 00:09:59,200
It's so good.

254
00:09:59,200 --> 00:09:59,800
Yeah, it was such a...

255
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,420
It was a good suggestion.

256
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,080
Yeah, yeah.

257
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,500
And then, it was surprising because I...

258
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,040
Because at first, it was going to be the regular stage.

259
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,360
And I requested the red curtains.

260
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:08,800
Yeah.

261
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,160
And then, I was envisioning how it would look like.

262
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,140
So, I was like, we do the red curtains to simulate the anime.

263
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,080
And then, do the spotlight thing.

264
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,200
And then, one by one, it's like spotlight, spotlight, spotlight.

265
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,280
No, it will not be up...

266
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:24,740
What?

267
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:32,200
I want to do break stuff.

268
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,940
I haven't decided the other song.

269
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:35,060
Yeah, yeah.

270
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,840
So, we're just figuring...

271
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,420
What if I do the sex song?

272
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:40,840
I mean, you can if you want.

273
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,420
Like, literally, it's your choice.

274
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,300
It's your channel.

275
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:45,120
Okay, guys.

276
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:46,180
I'll do the sex song.

277
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,480
You're actually gonna...

278
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,420
You're welcome.

279
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:50,720
Oh, hey.

280
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,720
Didn't see you there.

281
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:52,640
Look who I just did.

282
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,040
Had sex, undressed, saw her boobies in the rest.

283
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,120
Sure, nice of her to let you do that.

284
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,620
I like how I remember that song.

285
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,020
I know.

286
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,180
Versus all the other songs we just sang.

287
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,500
I remember during rehearsal, you're like, how the fuck do you keep remembering?

288
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:06,640
Because I would just...

289
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,300
Like, just easily rap it.

290
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:11,420
Yeah.

291
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:15,820
I won't do any of my cutie songs, I guess.

292
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:16,760
She kept looking...

293
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,900
Yeah, you should have done Maid of Dreaming.

294
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:23,240
Upload the cat one.

295
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:23,940
No, we have two.

296
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,060
We get two.

297
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:25,300
Two.

298
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,600
And I want to upload FNAF.

299
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,660
You can't stop me.

300
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,820
By the way, there's...

301
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:34,160
I don't know if you guys remember, but when we tweeted out the concert, I did an emoji of the tombstone.

302
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:36,240
That was the day I decided to...

303
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:38,980
I didn't even notice that.

304
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,920
We were like, why did people...

305
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,280
Why did she post the tombstone?

306
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:43,500
Because I was tweeting out about the living tombstones.

307
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,760
And that was the day I decided we were gonna do FNAF.

308
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:47,900
Oh my god.

309
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:52,360
And originally, Doki was just like, hey, you gotta choose another FNAF.

310
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,560
Oh no, you want me to do Discord.

311
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:56,860
Yeah, I was like, I'm gonna do FNAF and you'll do Discord.

312
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,160
And then she fucking baited me.

313
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:58,600
I was like, no.

314
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,120
No, you said you were gonna do it.

315
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,620
I wasn't serious.

316
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,080
You were like, okay.

317
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,020
And then I literally put that in my set list.

318
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,620
Yeah, because it suits you.

319
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:07,960
And then you didn't put Discord.

320
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:09,760
I was so betrayed.

321
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,380
I was so betrayed.

322
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,420
I literally put that in because she said she would put Discord.

323
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:14,780
No.

324
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,100
Discord, but...

325
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,380
I don't even know that song.

326
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:18,960
You literally suggested it.

327
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:19,100
I don't even know that.

328
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:19,640
I didn't suggest it.

329
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:20,740
You suggested Discord.

330
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,880
I don't know that song.

331
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:22,220
You did.

332
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,600
You did know that song.

333
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,620
You suggested that song to us.

334
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,280
Okay, I guess we need another revenge concert.

335
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,580
We just need another concert.

336
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,080
Sponsor us for another concert.

337
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,580
Don't know Discord.

338
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,800
Put it in West Coast though, please.

339
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:37,860
Yeah, we gotta go somewhere else.

340
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,960
If you sponsor us for another concert, she will do Discord.

341
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:42,220
Discord.

342
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,600
I told you my set list was pretty good.

343
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:46,180
I don't know that song.

344
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:46,760
Yes, you do.

345
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,100
I don't know Discord.

346
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,640
You're the one that suggested it.

347
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,040
I did.

348
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,400
I think you suggested it.

349
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:51,900
I was just like...

350
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:52,740
I know the name.

351
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,500
Like, I know the song, but I don't know it.

352
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,940
Like, I only know the name of it.

353
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,980
Yeah, but I'm glad when we saw, like, people...

354
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:02,740
Because we had a feed of the audience while we were doing the concert.

355
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:03,060
Yeah.

356
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:08,320
It was so cool just, like, seeing everybody just waving their penlights and just dancing.

357
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,180
By the way, guys, merch sold out.

358
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,040
All the merch.

359
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:11,920
Apparently.

360
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:18,280
Yeah, we were told that all the merch that was being sold at the concert sold out.

361
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:18,780
That's crazy.

362
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:19,260
By the end.

363
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:22,080
Like, people were still lining up, but it was just all sold out.

364
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,140
We didn't realize.

365
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,740
We were, like, so surprised.

366
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,020
Yeah.

367
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,020
Because they got a lot of stock.

368
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:26,460
Yeah.

369
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,200
They brought a lot.

370
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,460
The fact that...

371
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:30,080
But we still have online orders, though.

372
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,780
Like, we requested...

373
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:33,200
Because at first, they weren't going to do online orders.

374
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:36,340
But, like, I was like, can we please have them online?

375
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:36,580
Yeah.

376
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:39,200
Because I know we saw a lot of fans that really wanted it.

377
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:44,880
And, you know, if we did sell out, then people can still get the merch, even if it was sold out and everything.

378
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:46,740
There was a pit during break stuff?

379
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:48,200
Oh, my God.

380
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:48,720
There was a mosh...

381
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,600
I heard there was a mosh pit.

382
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:50,040
No way!

383
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,140
I heard people were moshing.

384
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,520
So we hope we're not too loud, because we see it goes red sometimes.

385
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:57,100
Oh, yeah.

386
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:57,800
Yeah, yeah.

387
00:13:59,320 --> 00:13:59,640
So...

388
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,520
But if we are peaking, let us know.

389
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,860
Or if it's too quiet, let us know.

390
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:05,180
Because we're sharing one mic.

391
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:09,360
By the way, like I said, I had one hour to pack before I went to Atlanta.

392
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:10,940
So I didn't bring anything.

393
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:11,960
Oh, that's your fault.

394
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,320
Yeah, I know.

395
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,300
I had a lot of other...

396
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:17,700
We had so much stuff to do the day before.

397
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:18,640
I know.

398
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,640
The day before.

399
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:19,920
Yeah.

400
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,640
So I literally, like...

401
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,880
So I literally was just, like...

402
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,280
I know, there was a lot of stuff.

403
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:26,660
There was so much stuff.

404
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,180
What other stuff that we wanted to talk about?

405
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:32,640
That...

406
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,200
Oh, yeah, when Doobie did the worm.

407
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,000
She told us, she was like, I'm gonna do the worm.

408
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:39,720
Yeah, she's like...

409
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,420
And she actually did it.

410
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:42,100
She was like, do you think I can do the worm?

411
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,740
I was like, oh my god, I'm gonna go for it.

412
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,660
She did the worm.

413
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,540
She did the...

414
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:51,320
She did the fucking worm.

415
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,400
We just here lied down.

416
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,280
She was so cute.

417
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,000
Yeah, yeah.

418
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:59,320
Did you guys recognize we did her move during the instrumental?

419
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:00,020
Oh, yeah.

420
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,580
We wanted to...

421
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:02,440
We wanted to circle around her.

422
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:06,360
Like, do her infamous Doobie move, too.

423
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,120
You guys recognized it?

424
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,980
Shake It was really rough for me.

425
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,240
It's so rough.

426
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,200
You did your best.

427
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:20,240
Okay, when we were trying to learn...

428
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,440
When I was trying to learn Shake It...

429
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,200
That was the last song we did.

430
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,120
Yeah, that was the last song.

431
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:31,080
When I was trying to learn Shake It, like, literally when I was listening to it, the guy was saying gibberish to me.

432
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:34,560
Like, there was a specific part in the line that was just gibberish.

433
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,080
And I was like, someone please give me a phonetic...

434
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:46,340
I, like, I literally... I listened to the song on, like, 0.25 speed and, like, listened to each syllable.

435
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:55,820
I had... I spent, like, what was it, three hours for one specific line trying to figure out how the fuck do I phonetically say this.

436
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,640
And it was so bad for me.

437
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:09,040
And then, like, Min had to get out of bed and, like, record the line for me so I could, like, listen to it and just repeat it.

438
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,000
Like, over and over.

439
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,120
Because I was like, I don't know what he's saying at that...

440
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,280
That song, I was really surprised.

441
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:17,940
I was just like, this is really...

442
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:21,820
No, I gave you a list because I was like, what do I do at a fucking husband hotel?

443
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,740
I remember, I was like, here's a list of songs we could do.

444
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:28,740
And one of them was husband hotel.

445
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:32,960
And then she looked at my list and then she picked...

446
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,580
Oh, no, my data.

447
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:36,440
Oh, no!

448
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:36,680
No!

449
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,000
Oh, we're back, we're back.

450
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,040
We're back.

451
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:40,960
Wait, no, it says...

452
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:41,860
It's...

453
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:42,400
We're back.

454
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:43,540
We're back.

455
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:45,280
Are we back?

456
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,380
We should be.

457
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:46,960
Sorry.

458
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,960
It's gonna be cutting in and out.

459
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,360
We're sorry, we're using my...

460
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:50,920
We won't...

461
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,220
It won't be a super long stream.

462
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:52,860
Yeah, yeah.

463
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:53,680
Sorry, guys.

464
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,400
It's...

465
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,380
It's really scuffed.

466
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,860
I can't tell if it's up or not.

467
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,220
They're saying we're back.

468
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:58,580
Oh, okay.

469
00:16:58,660 --> 00:16:59,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

470
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,320
Where did we stop the story?

471
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:01,860
I don't know where we stopped the story.

472
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,620
No, it's, like, going back to red.

473
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,100
I think there's...

474
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,120
I'm getting throttled now because I used up a lot.

475
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:06,680
Yeah.

476
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,040
Do you have...

477
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,400
Is your data unlimited or no?

478
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:08,720
No.

479
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:09,160
Oh.

480
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:10,920
It's not unlimited.

481
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:12,700
It's not...

482
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:16,380
It's, like, going from red to...

483
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:22,500
It's going from, like, green to yellow.

484
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:23,860
So we don't know where...

485
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:25,220
Are we actually back, though?

486
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:29,500
We can't tell because it goes back and forth a lot for us.

487
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:32,200
What were we going to say?

488
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,440
What were we in the story?

489
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,140
Where were we in the story?

490
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,680
Yeah, where are we cut out?

491
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:37,620
Uh-oh.

492
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,180
They're saying, uh-oh.

493
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:40,480
Oh, right.

494
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,340
Has been hotel.

495
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:42,500
Oh, yeah.

496
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:43,760
Okay, so we want to do...

497
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,900
Okay, I gave her a list.

498
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:47,340
In the list was, like, two has been hotel songs.

499
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:52,360
We can't finish the concert on has been hotel.

500
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,820
Yes, we can.

501
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,000
Oh, my gosh!

502
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,780
We just...

503
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:57,220
No!

504
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,900
Or shake it.

505
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,080
And then she chose shake it.

506
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,060
I was like, shake it is, like, a good feeling.

507
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:04,580
You could have suggested some songs, too.

508
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:08,480
I did my part suggesting songs.

509
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:11,980
You could have suggested your own song.

510
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:15,120
You did not have to fucking pick...

511
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:20,280
The has been hotel song I wanted to do was the one with Alistair and the TV guy.

512
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:21,540
What was it?

513
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,080
That's not a closing song!

514
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,640
That's a good closing song.

515
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:24,980
No, it's not!

516
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:29,600
But I also suggested shake it.

517
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:32,360
Yeah, like, shake it is a good feeling song.

518
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:34,260
Well, it's because my...

519
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,040
I only know idol shit, okay?

520
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:36,620
So...

521
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:37,840
Yeah, and I know how...

522
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,820
I know meme songs.

523
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:41,400
Yeah, so together we...

524
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,920
We somehow created a set list.

525
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,160
Oh, yeah, we saw the guy that brought his 3DS to record.

526
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:52,900
Yeah!

527
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,860
We saw that, we saw the ring camera.

528
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:57,260
Yeah, we saw the ring camera, we saw the 3DS.

529
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:59,120
I saw... I think I saw PSP, too.

530
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,480
Wait, somebody brought their PSP, that's funny.

531
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:01,900
Yeah.

532
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:02,600
That's funny.

533
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:05,820
We were looking at the...

534
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:06,840
We were looking...

535
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:07,260
We had...

536
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,500
We had Decompress.

537
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:10,060
After.

538
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:12,340
And we were watching the live tweet.

539
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:13,280
Like, not the...

540
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,460
Not the live shoots, but like, what you guys were live tweeting.

541
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:19,580
I loved how the JP bros were like...

542
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:21,960
They were like...

543
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,020
They were like...

544
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:25,840
When we were saying the more dumb...

545
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,960
When I was saying the more dumb songs.

546
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,680
They were like, what the fuck is going on?

547
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:34,640
But then when they talk about Mint, they're like, oh my god, what an idol.

548
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,640
And then there's me.

549
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:37,340
And there's you.

550
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:38,460
And there's me.

551
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,700
And that's so funny.

552
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:44,520
Yeah.

553
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:47,620
And you guys got to do the Hamtaro circle.

554
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:48,660
Oh, yeah, we saw...

555
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:49,600
Yes, we saw that.

556
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,080
I was worried.

557
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:54,460
I was just like, oh, like, at the beginning of the night, I was like, oh, there's so much room in there.

558
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:57,100
Like, they're gonna do it so easily.

559
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:00,580
But then, like, there just kept getting more and more and more people.

560
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:06,780
Yeah, and then I saw someone said that people who were in the front became the back because they did the same thing.

561
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,520
Sorry, that's just how it goes.

562
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,140
You had your time in the front.

563
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:11,800
Yeah.

564
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:12,880
Oh, yeah.

565
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:15,640
Also, like, what was funny was...

566
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,580
Oh my god.

567
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:22,740
Okay, so you can sort of tell which songs I took dance lessons for and which one I didn't.

568
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:32,000
Because, like, during the rehearsals, like, during the rehearsals, like, Min was doing... which one was it?

569
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:33,020
The...

570
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,440
Oh, yeah, yeah.

571
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:35,760
And I was, like, laughing at her.

572
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:37,160
I was laughing at her.

573
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:41,600
It's like, you were just shimmying around with you and the Doraemon one.

574
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:42,200
Oh, yeah.

575
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:44,580
I was just like, girl, like, move around some.

576
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:48,260
Come on.

577
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,920
Yeah, Doki took dance lessons.

578
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,920
Yeah, I took dance lessons.

579
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,880
It was painful.

580
00:20:53,500 --> 00:21:01,220
You can tell... you can tell exactly which one I was, like, winging it and which one I actually had, like, choreo that I did for dance lessons because...

581
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:01,940
The first one.

582
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:02,640
The first...

583
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,260
Our first song.

584
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,120
Our first song.

585
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,720
Yeah, that one.

586
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:14,680
But you can tell exactly because when I didn't have dance lessons, I was literally, like, winging it and just, like, shimmying around and just going with the flow of the song.

587
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:17,380
And what are you also gonna do for that, for the Doraemon one?

588
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:18,420
I don't know, that's the thing.

589
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:24,320
Like, how do you do... I was trying to look up for established choreo, and then, like, it was just kids.

590
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,540
It's just children doing, like, it was... it looked really stupid.

591
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:31,240
And you also did learn to meow.

592
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,500
Oh, learn to meow, I took dance lessons for it.

593
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:47,360
Yeah.

594
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,000
Yeah.

595
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:52,000
Learn to meow.

596
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:52,940
Learn to meow.

597
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:55,400
It's been, like, fun, though, that concert.

598
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,540
Like, for my... this is my first concert.

599
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:58,900
So, like, for me...

600
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:03,080
And also my first time, like, actually being able to do 3D.

601
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:04,260
So, like...

602
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:04,320
Yeah.

603
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:07,120
It's such a great experience in general.

604
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:11,480
It's very tiring putting those 3D suits on.

605
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,680
And then, like...

606
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:16,840
Because, like, dancing without the suits versus dancing in the suits is such a different experience.

607
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:17,400
Yeah.

608
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:19,380
Especially, like, yeah.

609
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:21,640
It's a lot limiting, and it's...

610
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,440
Yeah, yeah.

611
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:23,720
But it's good.

612
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:24,340
And...

613
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:25,780
You know.

614
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:27,720
Our first concert together.

615
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:28,140
Yeah!

616
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,400
It was really good.

617
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,720
I hope, like... I hope we can do more in the future.

618
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:34,480
Yeah, I hope we can do more 3D stuff in the future.

619
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,220
Yeah, me too.

620
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:37,880
I mean, we both have our...

621
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:40,220
I mean, we both have the models now, so...

622
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:41,940
We can, technically.

623
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,260
Right, right.

624
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:49,540
We can, but if anyone else wants to sponsor us for another concert, we're totally down.

625
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:53,720
We're marketable.

626
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:55,000
Look how many people there were.

627
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,260
Yeah, and then we'll do Discord.

628
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:57,880
No!

629
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,120
You said you would!

630
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:00,300
No!

631
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,620
You literally said it on stream!

632
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,080
I'm not gonna do it!

633
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,060
You said on stream that if we get another Revenge concert, you would do it.

634
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,860
No, I just said, I guess we need another Revenge concert.

635
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:08,900
Yeah, so then you'll do it.

636
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:09,440
No, I'm not.

637
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,720
Why are you not doing it?

638
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,940
If we get another Revenge concert.

639
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:13,080
I don't wanna...

640
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,920
Isn't that a My Little Pony song?

641
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:16,660
No, it's not.

642
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:17,560
Wait, what is it?

643
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:18,940
Okay, it is.

644
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,440
What the hell?

645
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,840
But it's a really good one.

646
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:24,000
It's a really good one.

647
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:24,920
Oh my god.

648
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:25,860
Discord.

649
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:26,860
See, they want you.

650
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:27,880
They want you to do it.

651
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,440
I don't know it.

652
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:34,100
Discord.

653
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:35,640
But, but...

654
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:40,800
Also, like, fuck the stans being, like, in accurate height.

655
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:43,820
When I saw it...

656
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:44,440
Yeah, you were so tiny.

657
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:49,060
When I saw it, because we had to sign it, I was like, why the fuck am I shorter?

658
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,260
You were like a little baby.

659
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:54,360
I was, like, smaller, like, dimension-wise, too.

660
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:59,760
Like, my face was basically the size of your fucking hand and everything.

661
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,220
No, you were so tiny.

662
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:05,700
I was tinier than her, because they made both stans the same size.

663
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,420
No, I think it's, um, they...

664
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,440
Yeah, no, my dad.

665
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,060
Dad resized and everything.

666
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,820
Yeah, they made you to dad size.

667
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,040
Yeah, so I was like, what the...

668
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:15,920
I was tall.

669
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:20,360
I was so tall.

670
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,660
Short King Doki.

671
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:32,900
Um, but yeah, I mean, like, it was a lot of work for both of us.

672
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:38,420
For, like, such a short amount of time, because we can say how long the concert prep was, right?

673
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:39,660
I think so.

674
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:40,320
Can we say it?

675
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,860
I mean, when we announced it, we said it was very last minute, too.

676
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:44,300
True.

677
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:44,700
Yeah.

678
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:49,800
We had three months to get all of this.

679
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:51,080
All of this and all the dances.

680
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:54,120
This was a three-month journey.

681
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,700
Learning all the songs.

682
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:01,200
But, like, we learned the songs and the dances within two months.

683
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:01,840
Yeah.

684
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,620
So, like, um, so yeah.

685
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,960
It was a lot to put together.

686
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:13,520
For, like, yeah, that's why I was, like, I had, like, I was so stressed out for it.

687
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:16,520
I was so behind in a lot of work, and then I played Marvel Rivals.

688
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,220
And that was even more...

689
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:20,440
For, like, 15 hours.

690
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:30,500
I was, like, Marvel Rivals is the only thing that gives me joy.

691
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:33,220
Oh, my God.

692
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:43,000
So, like, there was three months of prep, but technically, Mitten and I had two months to prep for all of this, because we had to decide songs and everything.

693
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:45,960
Well, we only had the one time to practice, like...

694
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:46,220
Together.

695
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:47,120
Together, yeah.

696
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,380
Yeah, we had one time to practice together in rehearsals.

697
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:49,880
Yeah.

698
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,120
And then, uh, two months to, uh, get everything together.

699
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:55,640
Yeah.

700
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,760
Individually-wise.

701
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:57,580
And then...

702
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:58,000
This song.

703
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,080
So, it was, like...

704
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,720
And it's hard learning a duet with, without...

705
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,220
Without the duet partner.

706
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,780
Without your duet partner.

707
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:08,260
Yeah, that was really difficult, too.

708
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,460
So, like, it was definitely, like, a journey.

709
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:13,620
It was 20 hours.

710
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,080
Oh, my bad.

711
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,360
It was 20 plus hours.

712
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:16,060
Shut up.

713
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:18,180
Shut up.

714
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:25,860
Um, but I didn't get to do much in Atlanta, not gonna lie.

715
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:27,120
I just existed.

716
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:29,660
Just for the...

717
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:31,420
I came just for the concert.

718
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:34,740
Did you get to go around the con at all?

719
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,520
Not really, not that much.

720
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:38,380
Yeah, not that much.

721
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:39,200
Um...

722
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,420
I didn't realize your schedule was gonna be so tight.

723
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:42,340
Yeah.

724
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:43,900
I wanted to go to the aquarium.

725
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:44,980
I did a lot...

726
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:45,560
Wait, really?

727
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,900
You could have said something!

728
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,680
I could have stayed an extra day.

729
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,280
I didn't know what your schedule was.

730
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:50,800
You didn't?

731
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:51,560
You didn't ask?

732
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,960
You could have asked me!

733
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,280
I didn't know what was going on.

734
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:56,180
I just assumed.

735
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:57,640
I assumed.

736
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,600
I didn't know what was going on.

737
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,640
Oh yeah, I found out what grits are today.

738
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,120
But what?

739
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:03,860
What grits are.

740
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,920
I never had grits before.

741
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:06,660
Oh, grits.

742
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:07,760
I've never had it either.

743
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,780
Yeah, and I was like, what the fuck is... I don't like grits.

744
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:11,580
I ordered grits and I was like, I don't like grits.

745
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:15,300
And I was like, I don't know if I googled what they are before.

746
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,180
I don't even know.

747
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:18,640
It's like, I don't know.

748
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:21,220
It's like, it's like a porridge taste.

749
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:22,360
It's like, I don't know.

750
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:23,080
I like oatmeal.

751
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:27,020
It's some wet... oh, not enough memory there.

752
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:27,740
Oh, okay.

753
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:28,580
We just got refreshed.

754
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:29,060
Don't worry.

755
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:32,240
We couldn't see chat, so we got refreshed our chat.

756
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:35,800
It's like congee.

757
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:36,540
Yeah, I guess.

758
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:36,840
Yeah.

759
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,100
Yeah, I can say it like that.

760
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:38,900
Oh, it's like congee.

761
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:39,640
Yeah, yeah.

762
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:40,420
It's like corn.

763
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,620
Corn, but not rice.

764
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,380
It's not rice, but corn.

765
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,540
I didn't like it.

766
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:46,720
It was not pleasant for me.

767
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,300
I think it's an acquired taste.

768
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:50,020
Yeah, I think.

769
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:55,060
No, guys, I'm technically leaving tomorrow.

770
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,720
Yeah, she literally came just for the congee.

771
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:00,580
Yeah, yeah.

772
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,820
I was like, I'm gonna be the weekend.

773
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:02,780
I'm gonna, you know.

774
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,540
Yeah, so I just...

775
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:09,900
I didn't know.

776
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:12,080
I didn't know you wanted me to stay longer.

777
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:13,440
I didn't know.

778
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:14,740
You didn't tell me your schedule.

779
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:17,960
On stream, I was like, what can we do, guys?

780
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,580
You didn't say that to me.

781
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,980
You told your chat.

782
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:26,220
I might be terminally online, but I don't keep track of everything going on.

783
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:30,340
She hates us.

784
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:31,980
She hates me.

785
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,680
Not you guys, but me.

786
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,220
I hate... She hates me.

787
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:40,420
It was like, oh, it's the booty call.

788
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:41,700
What?

789
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:43,220
A booty call.

790
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,780
I had to do the concert leaves.

791
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:46,920
Oh, my God.

792
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:52,940
That's crazy.

793
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:57,820
Yeah, like, my chat was like, you guys can go to the aquarium and to the ferris...

794
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:59,000
Oh, wait, we saw the ferris wheel.

795
00:28:59,120 --> 00:28:59,960
It was right next to the venue.

796
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:00,780
Yeah, we saw it.

797
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,540
That's so cool.

798
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,140
That's cool.

799
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:03,300
That's a nice venue.

800
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:04,580
Yeah, yeah.

801
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:05,240
That's really nice.

802
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:05,680
That's nice.

803
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:14,460
I think my favorite is, like, seeing the two, the giant drag moon and the giant whisk on the side, and then they got deflated.

804
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,360
They murdered them.

805
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:19,080
They murdered those guys.

806
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:20,060
That's funny.

807
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,260
That was pretty good.

808
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:26,220
Yeah, I bought a lot of clothes from the convention.

809
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:27,220
Oh, really?

810
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:27,720
Yeah.

811
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:28,320
What'd you get?

812
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:29,200
I got some hoodies.

813
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:31,580
Yeah, because I need new hoodies.

814
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,880
So I bought a lot of hoodies and stuff.

815
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:36,660
It was such a big convention.

816
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:39,920
I was, like, so overwhelmed, so I didn't do much there.

817
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:43,920
Yeah, I haven't really had time to walk around.

818
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:49,280
Yeah, I was just, like, I, like, checked out a few of the tables with them.

819
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:50,560
Like, I had time to leave.

820
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:52,360
Gotta go do rehearsals.

821
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:56,740
And we didn't stay... I didn't stay for... I don't know about you, but I didn't stay for too long.

822
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:07,000
We didn't go together because, like, we thought that if we went together, it would be a lot harder.

823
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,340
So we were, like, separated.

824
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,180
I had, like, a chauffeur, too.

825
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:14,160
Oh, yeah.

826
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:15,300
Yeah, I had a chauffeur.

827
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,020
You're a chauffeur.

828
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:16,660
So fancy.

829
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:18,960
My chauffeur that drove me everywhere.

830
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:19,780
So fancy.

831
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:24,860
Yeah, and then Mint didn't know you could have a chauffeur, so she took Ubers.

832
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:26,800
I took Ubers everywhere.

833
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,060
I spent all my money on Ubers.

834
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:36,620
And I was, like... because I was, like, waiting for her during... at the venue for rehearsals and stuff before the concert started.

835
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:38,200
I was like, where are you?

836
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,960
And she's like, oh, I'm waiting for my Uber.

837
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:44,820
And I was like, you know, you could ask the staff to drive you here.

838
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:53,180
Yeah, I spent all my money on Ubers.

839
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:56,980
Because I was like, can I... can I get someone to drive me to places?

840
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:01,740
So that's Mint's fault.

841
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,920
I didn't know that they would do that.

842
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:18,660
Um, but yeah, um, yeah, it was... I didn't stay for too long just because of the fact that um, we still had to practice and stuff there.

843
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,220
Oh, yeah.

844
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:21,200
And, like, get stuff ready and everything.

845
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:22,420
Get all set up and...

846
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:26,980
Yeah, so it was a lot of... I'm just glad it's over.

847
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:29,900
Like, we're... I'm so glad it's over.

848
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:30,380
I know.

849
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,240
That was so much stress.

850
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:36,060
I was so behind on a lot of work because I was just putting all my focus on the concert.

851
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:39,080
Yeah, we saw the Doki Mint Hoppies.

852
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:40,440
We got some.

853
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:41,700
Yeah, we got them too.

854
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:42,820
Yeah, someone gave them to us.

855
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:44,800
We got the blue one.

856
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,060
Yeah, the Phantom Thief one.

857
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:46,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

858
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:47,620
That's the one we got.

859
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:48,000
Yeah.

860
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:49,880
I think the yellow one is because they didn't have any left.

861
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:50,920
But...

862
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,080
That's the earlier one.

863
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:52,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

864
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:56,060
They asked us if we wanted them and we're like, yes!

865
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:00,380
So we got a lot of stuff.

866
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,960
We got all our merch stuff too.

867
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:03,600
And everything.

868
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,240
And we're happy to...

869
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:11,160
Oh, we saw a lot of like... What's the fans for Doobie's called?

870
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,220
Oh, what are Doobie's fans called?

871
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,400
Yeah, what are Doobie's fans called?

872
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:16,240
Does she have like an official fan name?

873
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,180
Yeah, yeah.

874
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,420
I don't remember.

875
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:24,580
What's the official name for the Doobers?

876
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:25,560
I like that, Doobers.

877
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,080
Dooberts?

878
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:29,420
Doobers?

879
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:30,300
Are they Doobers?

880
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,340
We saw a lot like some Doobers and stuff.

881
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:35,540
Yeah, there was someone like in a Doobie cosplay.

882
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:36,160
Yeah, yeah.

883
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:41,900
I sent it over to Doobie when I saw it because I thought it was really cute.

884
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:43,940
The Fortniter.

885
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:45,720
No official one yet.

886
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:47,060
Oh, you guys don't have an official one yet?

887
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:50,600
Oh, yeah, because I was like thinking I feel like if it wasn't an official one, we would know.

888
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,760
Self-proclaimed Doobers, got it.

889
00:32:54,760 --> 00:33:02,420
So like I sent Doobie like some of the cosplay photos that were in the tags and stuff.

890
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,660
Yeah, so she saw some of them.

891
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:09,780
And yeah, that was crazy.

892
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:12,920
Oh, yeah, guys, thanks for voting for me for FPSN.

893
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:13,440
Yay!

00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:16,620
And fanbase.

895
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:17,600
Dedicated fanbase.

896
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:19,860
Yeah, you guys deserve that award.

897
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:20,860
Good job, guys.

898
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:21,400
Good job.

899
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:23,000
Yeah, there's so many people there.

900
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:23,860
There's so many.

901
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:29,820
When we saw how many people like that was at the venue, we were like, oh my god, it was like so packed.

902
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:30,340
I know.

903
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:30,820
Yeah.

904
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:31,800
Yeah, it was crazy.

905
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:38,100
We were like, we knew like how many tickets were sold, but we didn't realize like how...

906
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,020
The scale of it.

907
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:39,280
The scale.

908
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,820
Like we were like, oh my god, it's a lot of people.

909
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:43,960
But then when we saw it, we were like, oh my god, that is a lot of people.

910
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:46,980
People were saying that it was like the line was wrapped around the building or something.

911
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:51,280
Yeah, and it took like hours, like not hours, but like a really long time to...

912
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,480
And then, by the way, guys, you know what's funny?

913
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:55,240
I knew...

914
00:33:55,240 --> 00:34:04,080
I knew what exactly I won because I had to send the pre-recorded video.

915
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:11,400
I knew exactly like...

916
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:14,140
Because like I said, I had to send the pre-recorded video over.

917
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:14,820
I only recorded...

918
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:20,820
But I had to pretend like, whoa, who's gonna win?

919
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:22,780
That's so messed up.

920
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:25,300
She doesn't ask everybody to do it.

921
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:29,500
And then, okay, so like during like when...

922
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:35,380
Like when we were there, I was like, oh yeah, like, did you record it?

923
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:37,180
Yeah, and I was like, no.

924
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,900
I was like, oh, I'm sorry.

925
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:44,440
It's fine, I voted for Kiara and they won, so...

926
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:51,540
Okay.

927
00:34:54,100 --> 00:35:04,220
I was like, because like, I think like if we can't be there live because we were like, you can't be there for the interviews and stuff.

928
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:07,900
So that's why they're like, oh, we really want to pre-record a video just to...

929
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:08,900
I mean, literally say it.

930
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:12,240
This is pre-recorded Doki because I'm literally doing concert right now.

931
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:13,040
Like...

932
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:22,760
So yeah, that's why like, I was told beforehand.

933
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,860
Just so I could get the video out to you guys.

934
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:29,000
Also like, I asked if we could change clip.

935
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:29,920
I don't even know what...

936
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,880
I didn't even know what the clip was that they showed.

937
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:35,640
Because like I said, like, I wasn't like, I had to do this.

938
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,620
So like, I don't even know.

939
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:42,820
But like, I remember like, today, this morning, I messaged and I was like, can I change the clip?

940
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:46,200
But they're like, if you messaged us earlier, yeah, but we can't now.

941
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:47,680
Because it's literally in a few hours.

942
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:51,760
Because I wanted to replace the clip for the shot that ended the war.

943
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,840
I really...

944
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:58,380
Oh, it was still the fucking horse clip.

945
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:01,180
Oh my god, they didn't pick anything new.

946
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:02,660
What's the horse clip?

947
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,200
It's the one...

948
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:07,480
Oh, it's the one where I died to a mine.

949
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,660
I died to...

950
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:11,940
Wait, how does that show your FPS?

951
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:12,940
Exactly!

952
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:14,860
Oh,

953
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:19,400
they also showed a deadlock.

954
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,800
A deadlock clip, really?

955
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:25,300
They couldn't even pick Marvel Rivals.

956
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:31,920
They didn't even pick Marvel Rivals.

957
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:35,980
They picked the MOBA game.

958
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,080
That's funny.

959
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:41,600
That's actually pretty funny.

960
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:46,320
They literally should have just been at the concert and taken the...

961
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,620
The Marvel Rivals clip from the concert.

962
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,940
That's pretty funny though.

963
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:58,600
The funniest thing is that it's not even first person.

964
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:02,240
Deadlock's a third-person shooter because the F stands for first.

965
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,880
Yeah, that's funny.

966
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,520
What else do we want to talk about for the concert?

967
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,320
My brain is mush.

968
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,220
I know, her brain is really mushy right now.

969
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:19,200
I enjoyed the concert.

970
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:20,360
Yeah, it was so much fun.

971
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:23,280
If we had to do it again, I would love for more time.

972
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:27,000
The three months was intense.

973
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,120
I think it all worked out really well.

974
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,500
We were worried.

975
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:32,840
We were really worried.

976
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:37,660
I'm glad that in the end it actually worked out.

977
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:38,900
Everything worked out.

978
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:41,140
We do have everything.

979
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:45,180
They were recording everything as it was going on.

980
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:55,180
We were wondering if things are okay, then maybe in the future we could release the full thing in the future.

981
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:58,820
With the audience POV stuff too.

982
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:07,040
What you guys didn't see is that when we were performing, we got a feed of cameras with a drone.

983
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:08,320
It's not a drone.

984
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:08,920
It was not a drone.

985
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:14,040
It was just him holding it or whatever.

986
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:18,760
There were several cameras.

987
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:19,800
There was a lot.

988
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:21,180
I feel like they had enough footage.

989
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:22,300
We had views of the audience too.

990
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,500
It was really crazy.

991
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,040
Not promising anything.

992
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:32,600
Not promising anything, but always the potential for something in the future.

993
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:39,400
I would love to do this again.

994
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:43,780
Openers were great.

995
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,600
I know, everyone was so good.

996
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:47,040
Yeah, everyone was really good.

997
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:49,200
What was that song?

998
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,340
The one that Juna did.

999
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:53,660
When Juna did that song, I had my hands on my head.

1000
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,280
Oh, the golden shower one.

1001
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,520
I was like, no fucking way.

1002
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,900
I had my hands on my head.

1003
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:04,900
I was like, I was not okay.

1004
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:10,020
I was like, not in front of the wisps.

1005
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,220
Okay, so like, yeah.

1006
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:18,920
And then Mint showed me a tweet of how one of the wisps is going to bring his entire family to the concert.

1007
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:20,440
Oh, yeah, I saw a tweet.

1008
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:23,360
I don't know if it was a wisp, but I saw someone before.

1009
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,900
No, they added you.

1010
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,780
So it has to be a wisp because they added you.

1011
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:28,600
Did they add me?

1012
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,360
Yeah, they specifically added you.

1013
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,920
Before the concert, like a couple, like, I don't know, like last week or something.

1014
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:34,480
I'm like, I'm gonna bring my whole family.

1015
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,220
And I was like, oh, no.

1016
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:44,480
And then I was like, a child saw that.

1017
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,380
Or their mom.

1018
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:49,480
It's either a child or a mom.

1019
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:57,820
We didn't realize that they had advertised the concert as family friendly until like a couple days ago.

1020
00:39:57,820 --> 00:40:01,800
I was like, I was like, oh, well, you know, we just have the one song.

1021
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:05,020
They're just I had just had sex, like the Lonely Violet song.

1022
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,660
And then Brickstuff chose us.

1023
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:09,320
And then I was like, oh, yeah, I chose Brickstuff.

1024
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,240
Sorry.

1025
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,040
Sorry, parents.

1026
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:16,840
Sorry.

1027
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:22,600
We also didn't know their setlist, the opener setlist until like today.

1028
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:26,540
Yeah, we found out about the setlist until today, basically.

1029
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:27,020
Yeah.

1030
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:30,440
And I was like, I was like, what's Golden Shower?

1031
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:35,920
And then like the organizers were like, oh, you're gonna see because they were like rehearsing to the organizers.

1032
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:37,140
And we didn't know.

1033
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,980
We didn't know anything about the opening acts.

1034
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:42,120
We know who, of course, we know who was performing the opening act.

1035
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:43,860
We didn't know what songs they picked.

1036
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,360
So we saw the list and we're like, the fuck is that?

1037
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:47,240
What is that?

1038
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:48,900
Thanks, Juna.

1039
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:52,260
What were your favorite songs?

1040
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,260
What were your favorites?

1041
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,580
Yeah, during the concerts.

1042
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:56,700
What was your favorite?

1043
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:57,400
Yeah.

1044
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,220
What was it?

1045
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:00,460
What were your favorite?

1046
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:06,600
Yeah, I think my favorite is when like, regarding like not song, but the experience was when the audience sang with us.

1047
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,060
And that's my favorite.

1048
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,940
Okay, not the openings, like ours.

1049
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:14,060
Damn.

1050
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:16,140
Our songs.

1051
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,960
Like, oh, I don't know anything.

1052
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,860
A lot of people said last cup of coffee was their favorite.

1053
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:28,900
I'm not, I want to upload last cup of coffee.

1054
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:39,540
I'm planning on doing last, for those who just came in, I want to do, I'm planning on uploading last cup of coffee and Five Nights at Freddy's.

1055
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:40,120
Yeah.

1056
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:43,140
Yeah, I'm sorry for learn to meow people.

1057
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:48,880
My dance for Five Nights at Freddy's was so good.

1058
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:49,840
What the fuck?

1059
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:55,620
You're just like, oh, I put so much effort into this.

1060
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:59,200
They're just like, oh, meow, meow, meow.

1061
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,420
It's because we got the cat ears.

1062
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:02,500
And the cat tail, that's why.

1063
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,120
It's literally because of that.

1064
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:07,100
But that's like, because I want to do like a slow song and then a fast song too.

1065
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:07,740
Oh, that's fair.

1066
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:09,780
Too, and everything.

1067
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:14,100
And what about, what's your favorite songs from it?

1068
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:18,240
What was your favorite songs, guys?

1069
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,380
No, I want to see Dokey Cat.

1070
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:24,500
We have Dokefield at home.

1071
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,320
Bring Dokefield back!

1072
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:34,780
Break Stuff, New Romantic Cellars and Break Stuff.

1073
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:35,840
I mean, they were really good.

1074
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:37,820
I had a lot of fun doing Break Stuff.

1075
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:38,520
Yeah, yeah.

1076
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:42,100
And New Romantic Cellar, the choreo for that was crazy.

1077
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:46,220
Like watching you do the choreo for New Romantic Cellar.

1078
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:50,200
I just had to, I couldn't remember what the official dance was.

1079
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:54,640
So I would just have to like, I was like, oh, improvise.

1080
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:55,840
Yeah.

1081
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:56,960
Improvise.

1082
00:42:57,340 --> 00:42:59,440
Oh, wait, hey, guess who's in, who awkward?

1083
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:00,840
LeWood!

1084
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:02,800
We saw your stream!

1085
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:03,800
You know what's funny?

1086
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:05,540
The fact that we both retweeted it.

1087
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:11,000
We would like, we would like, we saw that it got really high.

1088
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:12,460
Like during, in between.

1089
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:14,540
The opening acts.

1090
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:18,040
No, like in between your set and like, we would like, check it.

1091
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:20,860
And like, I was like, I was like, holy shit.

1092
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:23,240
It's like, he's like that guy in the movie theater.

1093
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:28,140
That's like, sneakily, like, but then like, the actors retweeted it.

1094
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:32,800
We're like, we endorsed it.

1095
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:34,640
I got insane.

1096
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:36,720
It was like up to 60k or something.

1097
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:38,200
Yeah, 69, nice.

1098
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:38,760
69?

1099
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:41,100
No, I thought I saw that.

1100
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:42,240
60, yeah, yeah.

1101
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:43,820
I saw 60, 60 something.

1102
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:44,960
Yeah, that's crazy.

1103
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:45,800
That's crazy.

1104
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:50,500
Especially like, um, you know, from just us retweeting it on Twitter.

1105
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:53,260
And yet, like, we wanted everybody to know.

1106
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:54,120
I've never even had that many viewers before.

1107
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:56,700
I want people, I want, sorry.

1108
00:43:58,400 --> 00:43:59,820
What the hell, man?

1109
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:00,900
I can't even say that.

1110
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:04,540
I'm a failure of a YouTuber.

1111
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:05,040
No!

1112
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:09,200
You were part of the concert, so you now, now you can say it.

1113
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:10,580
Now you can say it.

1114
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:12,660
You're not a failure, man.

1115
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:14,780
You're not a failure.

1116
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:23,180
We literally just had a successful concert where all our merch sold out.

1117
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:28,080
I think that's the craziest part, that all our merch sold out.

1118
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:30,560
And like, people were still lining up for merch.

1119
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:35,740
Like, we had four items sold out before the concert even started.

1120
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:36,620
Yeah, they were there.

1121
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,060
And they cut off the line, too.

1122
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:38,740
They cut the line.

1123
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:40,560
They had to cut the line early.

1124
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:46,180
And even then, like, four things sold out before it, like, started.

1125
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:55,160
So the fact that we sold everything afterward, like, when the concert was over, it was really crazy to think about.

1126
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:57,420
Someone said I literally only got a postcard.

1127
00:44:57,620 --> 00:45:00,140
I'm glad you were able to get something, but we're gonna have online orders.

1128
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:07,620
So if you weren't able to get anything, if you wanted something, we're gonna have online orders, too, that's coming up after the concert.

1129
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:10,600
I think you can just, we'll post a link for it on Twitter.

1130
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:16,380
And like, also, like, I guess on our YouTube community post and stuff, too.

1131
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:18,700
I'm happy.

1132
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:19,640
I'm happy it was successful.

1133
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:20,540
We were so worried.

1134
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:21,720
We were pretty worried.

1135
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:23,380
We'd be like, how many tickets sold?

1136
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:27,520
Every other day, we'd be like, how many tickets sold?

1137
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:34,180
I remember when they told us the venue, I was like, oh, shit.

1138
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:36,300
Like, this place has a really big capacity.

1139
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:40,520
Min was telling me how, like, yesterday, there was a K-pop group there.

1140
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:46,100
Yeah, there was apparently, like, some K-pop group at the same venue yesterday.

1141
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:48,300
Yeah, so we were, like, super surprised.

1142
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:53,980
And then, like, I think, like, they never, like, had VTubers at the concert before.

1143
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,100
They never had VTubers there before.

1144
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:59,320
So they were like, what the fuck is going on?

1145
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:02,960
Yeah.

1146
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:07,720
Oh, yeah, she explained to me what ORA no white girl is.

1147
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:10,140
I was so happy she finally explained it to me.

1148
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:13,960
I was like, the fuck is ORA no white girl?

1149
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:16,860
Oh, wait, she didn't explain it to me.

1150
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:20,560
I asked, and she never bothered to explain it to me.

1151
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:24,960
And then someone else asked, and then she started explaining to them without hesitation.

1152
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:25,620
Yeah.

1153
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:28,320
So I had to, like, learn it via, like, a third party.

1154
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:31,920
Whatever, you still learn.

1155
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:32,700
I still learn.

1156
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:35,580
I'm gonna forget about it and just be like, what the fuck is ORA no white girl?

1157
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:36,600
I'm not gonna explain it again.

1158
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:40,560
Well, I'm gonna wait for a third person to come in and be like, what's ORA no white girl?

1159
00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:41,580
You'll never know.

1160
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:47,440
I'm happy.

1161
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:48,440
I'm happy.

1162
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:49,480
Me too.

1163
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:51,540
We're both tired.

1164
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:52,460
I might...

1165
00:46:52,460 --> 00:46:53,080
Are you gonna...

1166
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:54,440
Are you gonna take a break or are you gonna...

1167
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:57,520
I'm gonna take a break when I come back.

1168
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:00,280
Because I'm really tired.

1169
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:01,740
No, I'm just gonna...

1170
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:03,660
You're just gonna keep going?

1171
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:04,620
Yeah, I'll take...

1172
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:05,500
Gas, gas, gas, gas.

1173
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:10,560
Well, I go home until the day after tomorrow, so I will...

1174
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:13,500
You're just gonna use that day as, like, your rest day?

1175
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:15,680
Yeah, I don't know yet.

1176
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:17,040
For me, I'm definitely gonna...

1177
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:20,900
Well, I'm gonna be playing Marble Rivals, but it doesn't mean I'm gonna be streaming it.

1178
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:24,780
Just streaming, no talk.

1179
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:27,060
Streaming Marble Rivals.

1180
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:29,940
I just get angry and then start talking.

1181
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:37,120
But I'm definitely gonna take a couple of day break.

1182
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:38,580
I don't have a tournament on...

1183
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:41,500
I have a tournament on Saturday next week.

1184
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:44,080
Yeah, take a break before then.

1185
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:44,840
Yeah, no, that's what I'm saying.

1186
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:45,500
Rest your voice, please.

1187
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:50,280
I'm taking a break before Saturday for the tournament.

1188
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:52,460
I was like, are you gonna be able to sing tonight?

1189
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:53,300
Your voice is...

1190
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:54,820
Oh yeah, my voice was so bad.

1191
00:47:54,820 --> 00:48:01,560
I had so much cough drops and stuff going in, but it was worth it because I got top 500 in Marble Rivals.

1192
00:48:07,450 --> 00:48:09,330
I think it was worth it.

1193
00:48:09,590 --> 00:48:12,250
I lost it in five hours, by the way.

1194
00:48:12,710 --> 00:48:12,990
Really?

1195
00:48:14,210 --> 00:48:18,750
Because everybody's climbing every day, so I got it and then I lost it in five hours.

1196
00:48:18,750 --> 00:48:19,670
Oh my god!

1197
00:48:20,150 --> 00:48:20,870
Worth it.

1198
00:48:20,950 --> 00:48:23,650
It was so worth it because I can say I touched top 500.

1199
00:48:27,890 --> 00:48:29,450
It was very important.

1200
00:48:29,650 --> 00:48:34,590
It was so worth it, you guys.

1201
00:48:34,710 --> 00:48:35,510
You don't understand.

1202
00:48:38,510 --> 00:48:41,390
Yeah, when I get back, it's time to grind again.

1203
00:48:42,490 --> 00:48:43,530
Oh, you're so tired.

1204
00:48:43,850 --> 00:48:44,730
I'm so sleepy.

1205
00:48:44,730 --> 00:48:45,450
You're so sleepy.

1206
00:48:46,830 --> 00:48:48,650
Is there anything else you want to talk about from the concert?

1207
00:48:49,210 --> 00:48:50,470
Nothing I can think about.

1208
00:48:51,270 --> 00:48:52,570
I'm thinking right now...

1209
00:48:57,070 --> 00:49:01,590
We talked about how the set list was done and then the choreo and stuff like that.

1210
00:49:01,690 --> 00:49:02,590
Yeah, I think we talked about that.

1211
00:49:03,630 --> 00:49:05,370
What our day was like.

1212
00:49:05,450 --> 00:49:07,450
I think that, yeah, they were like, I want to sleep too.

1213
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:08,950
EP time!

1214
00:49:09,010 --> 00:49:09,910
EP time!

1215
00:49:11,430 --> 00:49:12,310
EP time!

1216
00:49:12,430 --> 00:49:13,510
We didn't eat dinner.

1217
00:49:13,890 --> 00:49:14,510
No, we didn't eat dinner.

1218
00:49:15,330 --> 00:49:21,350
We didn't want to eat something before the concert because of our stomachs and stuff.

1219
00:49:21,350 --> 00:49:24,850
And we were so tired.

1220
00:49:24,970 --> 00:49:28,170
We just went straight here to do a post-concert off-collab.

1221
00:49:28,310 --> 00:49:28,610
Yeah.

1222
00:49:28,670 --> 00:49:29,850
Oh, yeah, by my Nendoroid guys.

1223
00:49:29,950 --> 00:49:30,190
I forgot.

1224
00:49:32,210 --> 00:49:35,670
I was like, hey man, can I do the off-collab?

1225
00:49:36,090 --> 00:49:39,950
Because I want to show my Nendoroid too.

1226
00:49:40,430 --> 00:49:41,710
And then she's like, yeah.

1227
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:43,430
And then we forgot all about it.

1228
00:49:43,910 --> 00:49:47,730
I thought, well, we did the last off-collab on my channel.

1229
00:49:47,810 --> 00:49:50,170
I was just like, I just figured you would do the next one.

1230
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:54,840
And then by my Nendoroid, I don't have the picture up, but like, you can sort of...

1231
00:49:56,210 --> 00:49:58,570
Google Dookie for Nendoroid.

1232
00:49:59,450 --> 00:50:02,610
Google the work yourself, guys, guys.

1233
00:50:03,010 --> 00:50:08,070
If I try to Google something, the stream might go...

1234
00:50:08,070 --> 00:50:08,630
The stream will crash.

1235
00:50:09,490 --> 00:50:11,050
The stream will be...

1236
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:12,130
The stream will die.

1237
00:50:13,190 --> 00:50:17,430
The stream would be like, what's this new stuff you're trying to search up for?

1238
00:50:19,070 --> 00:50:21,370
I just realized it's almost 1am.

1239
00:50:21,470 --> 00:50:23,030
Oh my god, you're right.

1240
00:50:23,170 --> 00:50:28,260
My laptop is set to West Coast still, so I forgot that it's like...

1241
00:50:29,150 --> 00:50:30,550
It's dead hours.

1242
00:50:30,830 --> 00:50:31,190
Yeah.

1243
00:50:31,410 --> 00:50:32,990
Oh yeah, Waffle House is still open.

1244
00:50:33,550 --> 00:50:34,470
Waffle House is still open.

1245
00:50:35,210 --> 00:50:37,090
I'm gonna go back and I'm gonna go...

1246
00:50:37,090 --> 00:50:38,230
You're going back to your own hotel?

1247
00:50:38,530 --> 00:50:39,830
Yeah, I'm gonna go sleep.

1248
00:50:40,150 --> 00:50:40,470
Yeah.

1249
00:50:42,110 --> 00:50:44,270
I'm not gonna ever get this hotel.

1250
00:50:44,830 --> 00:50:46,030
No, now we know.

1251
00:50:46,670 --> 00:50:47,650
Now we know.

1252
00:50:50,050 --> 00:50:51,010
That's still...

1253
00:50:51,010 --> 00:50:52,350
Oh yeah, almost...

1254
00:50:52,350 --> 00:50:57,630
By the way, guys, I almost couldn't fly to Atlanta.

1255
00:50:57,990 --> 00:50:58,210
What?

1256
00:50:58,450 --> 00:51:02,150
Because like, my passport expires in five days.

1257
00:51:04,130 --> 00:51:05,830
Oh my god, you didn't...

1258
00:51:05,830 --> 00:51:07,870
Oh my god, that would have been a disaster.

1259
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:09,590
Yeah, okay, so like...

1260
00:51:09,590 --> 00:51:10,670
That would have been so bad.

1261
00:51:10,970 --> 00:51:13,850
People were like, your passport expires in five days.

1262
00:51:13,890 --> 00:51:16,010
Are you even allowed to go to another country?

1263
00:51:16,030 --> 00:51:20,330
And then I was like, well, I was in America like two weeks, two or three weeks ago.

1264
00:51:20,470 --> 00:51:21,430
So like, I thought...

1265
00:51:21,430 --> 00:51:24,310
And then they're like, your passport has to be like valid within six months.

1266
00:51:24,430 --> 00:51:28,570
And I was like, apparently Canadians don't have to follow that rule for now.

1267
00:51:28,690 --> 00:51:35,450
Oh my god, guys, you guys, if the concert was cancelled, you can blame Doki.

1268
00:51:36,210 --> 00:51:36,910
Oh my god.

1269
00:51:36,910 --> 00:51:41,810
Because I thought it was okay because I was able to go to America like a couple of weeks ago.

1270
00:51:42,050 --> 00:51:44,730
So I was just like, oh, it will be all right as long as I come back.

1271
00:51:44,730 --> 00:51:51,950
And then they have to like call people and then the person came down and was like, no, she's okay to go as long as she comes back before the passport expires.

1272
00:51:52,450 --> 00:51:56,470
Because they like put me in a separate area and they're like, we're gonna ask somebody about this.

1273
00:51:58,750 --> 00:52:01,610
Guys, the concert almost didn't happen.

1274
00:52:03,230 --> 00:52:04,770
The concert almost...

1275
00:52:04,770 --> 00:52:06,090
I did not know this.

1276
00:52:07,130 --> 00:52:09,290
I revealed it on the street.

1277
00:52:10,270 --> 00:52:12,490
I'm glad you didn't say anything before.

1278
00:52:12,490 --> 00:52:14,710
I would have been stressed out.

1279
00:52:15,190 --> 00:52:18,250
I would have been so stressed out.

1280
00:52:18,290 --> 00:52:20,870
So anyway, I'm gonna renew my passport when I come back.

1281
00:52:22,350 --> 00:52:23,450
I'm leaving now.

1282
00:52:24,450 --> 00:52:25,470
I'm going.

1283
00:52:26,490 --> 00:52:28,770
I'm leaving this curse.

1284
00:52:28,790 --> 00:52:30,230
But hey, I got it.

1285
00:52:30,410 --> 00:52:32,510
I got a year.

1286
00:52:33,530 --> 00:52:34,910
Oh my god.

1287
00:52:35,230 --> 00:52:36,990
It's like wild.

1288
00:52:38,690 --> 00:52:40,830
Like, when you're coming back, I was like...

1289
00:52:40,830 --> 00:52:42,670
Imagine doing all this work.

1290
00:52:42,670 --> 00:52:45,770
And then you're like, hey guys, my passport is expired.

1291
00:52:46,030 --> 00:52:47,470
No, it's not expired yet.

1292
00:52:47,670 --> 00:52:48,410
But like, it's not.

1293
00:52:48,970 --> 00:52:49,910
It's not bad.

1294
00:52:49,930 --> 00:52:52,170
I've always heard this month thing though.

1295
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:55,150
Yeah, but only if you're only if you're like going outside of NA.

1296
00:52:56,750 --> 00:53:01,890
So like, because I'm Canadian, I'm allowed to like, go to your country.

1297
00:53:02,690 --> 00:53:05,970
Despite whatever the fuck my passport dated, as long as it's not expired.

1298
00:53:06,430 --> 00:53:08,430
Because like, for now, we have a good relationship.

1299
00:53:09,130 --> 00:53:09,830
For now?

1300
00:53:12,110 --> 00:53:13,030
For now.

1301
00:53:13,250 --> 00:53:13,910
For now.

1302
00:53:14,350 --> 00:53:16,870
Well, it's a good thing that you also didn't stay here longer.

1303
00:53:17,130 --> 00:53:17,590
You know what?

1304
00:53:18,970 --> 00:53:20,770
Maybe it's good, you know?

1305
00:53:21,790 --> 00:53:22,350
Nevermind.

1306
00:53:24,330 --> 00:53:26,010
So we'll see how it goes.

1307
00:53:27,170 --> 00:53:28,290
Get a new passport.

1308
00:53:28,370 --> 00:53:29,930
Renew your passport, please.

1309
00:53:30,330 --> 00:53:30,950
I will.

1310
00:53:31,170 --> 00:53:31,970
I will.

1311
00:53:32,750 --> 00:53:34,550
When I come back.

1312
00:53:36,010 --> 00:53:37,710
Okay, I'm gonna go.

1313
00:53:38,190 --> 00:53:40,990
Thank you everybody for coming.

1314
00:53:41,970 --> 00:53:43,890
Thank you for those who came to the concert.

1315
00:53:44,350 --> 00:53:48,590
And like, I know like, a lot of you guys were planning on like, grabbing dinner right after the concert.

1316
00:53:48,710 --> 00:53:50,490
But then you're like, we gotta watch the Off Colab!

1317
00:53:50,890 --> 00:53:52,230
And then thank you guys for staying.

1318
00:53:52,790 --> 00:53:54,190
A lot of people flew in too.

1319
00:53:54,210 --> 00:53:56,050
Yeah, a lot of people flew in from everywhere.

1320
00:53:56,450 --> 00:54:01,230
We saw so many like, JP fans coming over.

1321
00:54:01,590 --> 00:54:02,110
I think like...

1322
00:54:04,770 --> 00:54:08,230
I think like, I thought it was like, really cool.

1323
00:54:08,550 --> 00:54:11,690
Was that there were like, fans who've like, never even heard of us.

1324
00:54:11,770 --> 00:54:13,930
Yeah, people that were coming for other...

1325
00:54:13,930 --> 00:54:16,730
Yeah, for the guests and stuff who have never heard of us.

1326
00:54:16,910 --> 00:54:18,290
And like, came for some of the guests.

1327
00:54:18,530 --> 00:54:21,930
And they were like, they really like, learned about us and enjoyed us.

1328
00:54:22,530 --> 00:54:25,230
Enjoyed our content from the concert, which was really cool.

1329
00:54:27,250 --> 00:54:31,210
Yeah, but thank you to everybody that like, flew in from everywhere, basically.

1330
00:54:31,830 --> 00:54:34,850
From different countries just to see us.

1331
00:54:34,950 --> 00:54:35,890
Because it's very expensive.

1332
00:54:36,130 --> 00:54:36,670
It's not cheap.

1333
00:54:36,830 --> 00:54:36,870
I know.

1334
00:54:37,230 --> 00:54:38,030
It's not cheap at all.

1335
00:54:38,270 --> 00:54:40,750
I mean, the concert wasn't very cheap either.

1336
00:54:41,090 --> 00:54:42,210
So, you know, thank you guys.

1337
00:54:42,230 --> 00:54:46,090
Yeah, and then there's hotels and like, flights and like, money.

1338
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:49,310
Hopefully you guys all got to meet up and like, see each other.

1339
00:54:49,310 --> 00:54:51,950
Yeah, I saw like, people made like, new friends and stuff.

1340
00:54:52,070 --> 00:54:53,210
Yeah, that's really sweet.

1341
00:54:53,310 --> 00:54:56,390
New dragons and like, wisps like, becoming friends with each other.

1342
00:54:56,950 --> 00:54:58,810
And now they're all gonna go have sex together.

1343
00:55:04,570 --> 00:55:07,790
And then they're gonna make wisp goons and they're gonna subscribe to us.

1344
00:55:08,730 --> 00:55:11,590
Oh, I just had sex.

1345
00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:13,790
Woo!

1346
00:55:14,410 --> 00:55:15,850
I really felt good.

1347
00:55:16,390 --> 00:55:17,910
Felt so good.

1348
00:55:18,410 --> 00:55:19,950
Oh, hey, didn't see you there.

1349
00:55:20,070 --> 00:55:23,470
Look what I just did, had sex, undressed, saw her boobies and the rest.

1350
00:55:23,990 --> 00:55:25,450
Oh, sure, nice of her to let you do that thing.

1351
00:55:25,450 --> 00:55:26,310
Don't you do that thing.

1352
00:55:26,370 --> 00:55:28,490
Nice of any girl ever now saying.

1353
00:55:29,070 --> 00:55:31,850
Okay, thanks guys!

1354
00:55:31,850 --> 00:55:32,890
Thank you everybody!

1355
00:55:33,970 --> 00:55:35,350
Thank you, thank you!

1356
00:55:36,350 --> 00:55:38,990
We're gonna leave now.

1357
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:41,010
But thank you everybody for coming.

1358
00:55:41,510 --> 00:55:45,850
We really appreciate it for this like, impromptu off collab.

1359
00:55:47,870 --> 00:55:49,870
Thank you everyone, it was a great experience.

1360
00:55:51,310 --> 00:55:52,590
Definitely unforgettable.

1361
00:55:52,910 --> 00:55:54,410
I'm gonna go to sleep now.

1362
00:55:55,450 --> 00:56:00,130
And I'm glad that, you know, I got to share a stage with Mint for this.

1363
00:56:01,670 --> 00:56:02,950
So thank you everybody.

1364
00:56:03,070 --> 00:56:04,650
We're sorry this one was really...

1365
00:56:04,650 --> 00:56:07,150
I didn't plan...

1366
00:56:07,150 --> 00:56:08,530
I didn't prepare anything for this.

1367
00:56:08,830 --> 00:56:09,050
No.

1368
00:56:10,170 --> 00:56:11,650
Literally, I thought...

1369
00:56:11,650 --> 00:56:13,610
YouTube is like the stream's bitrate.

1370
00:56:15,450 --> 00:56:18,270
If it works, it works, YouTube!

1371
00:56:18,910 --> 00:56:19,530
Yeah, shut up.

1372
00:56:19,870 --> 00:56:21,170
They're judging our...

1373
00:56:21,970 --> 00:56:23,610
They're size-queening us.

1374
00:56:23,690 --> 00:56:26,570
They're like, the size of your bitrate is not big enough.

1375
00:56:26,610 --> 00:56:30,050
Yeah, so we hope you all enjoyed the concert.

1376
00:56:30,990 --> 00:56:33,750
And seeing us dance and everything in 3D.

1377
00:56:34,230 --> 00:56:38,270
And can't wait to have our actual official 3D debut.

1378
00:56:38,590 --> 00:56:38,990
Yeah!

1379
00:56:39,850 --> 00:56:41,630
And then maybe in the future we do another concert.

1380
00:56:41,870 --> 00:56:43,290
I would love it for it to be...

1381
00:56:43,290 --> 00:56:44,910
There will be like, streaming tickets too.

1382
00:56:45,010 --> 00:56:45,630
I know, right?

1383
00:56:45,990 --> 00:56:46,350
Hopefully.

1384
00:56:46,630 --> 00:56:50,990
Whoever wants to sponsor us for our next concert, we'll do it if there's streaming tickets too.

1385
00:56:51,090 --> 00:56:51,910
Because there's potential.

1386
00:56:53,050 --> 00:56:54,590
Alright, we're gonna go for real now.

1387
00:56:54,770 --> 00:56:55,490
Goodnight everybody!

1388
00:56:56,050 --> 00:56:56,810
Bye bye!

1389
00:56:56,810 --> 00:56:57,730
Bye bye!

1390
00:56:59,070 --> 00:57:02,190
Wait, do it on OBS so it like, syncs up.

1391
00:57:02,590 --> 00:57:03,050
Oh, okay.

1392
00:57:03,390 --> 00:57:03,770
Bye!

1393
00:57:04,770 --> 00:57:06,810
Wait, does it sync up if I do that?

1394
00:57:06,830 --> 00:57:11,970
If you end it, so if you end it through OBS first, it'll like, finish playing what you say.

1395
00:57:12,230 --> 00:57:12,490
Okay.

1396
00:57:13,510 --> 00:57:14,350
And then, stop it.

1397
00:57:14,350 --> 00:57:17,190
How do I know if the stream ends correctly?

1398
00:57:18,490 --> 00:57:20,710
But if you end it on YouTube, it just cuts it.

1399
00:57:20,890 --> 00:57:21,370
Oh, okay.

1400
00:57:21,570 --> 00:57:22,650
So just stop streaming, and cut it out.

1401
00:57:22,650 --> 00:57:23,010
Oh, okay.
