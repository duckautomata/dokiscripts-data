1
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,500
Hey buddy!

2
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,700
Yeah!

3
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:01,960
I am so fucking tired right now.

4
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:05,560
As you guys know, I haven't slept yet.

5
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,400
I checked down two coffees, but I'm here.

6
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,440
I need to update you guys on life.

7
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,000
What the fuck do you mean you haven't slept?

8
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:19,440
Okay.

9
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,200
Okay, first off, there's two reasons.

10
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:28,380
I had to reset my sleep schedule again, because I fucked it up by working.

11
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:33,500
And then, two, I had a lot of work.

12
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:42,440
So, it's like, you know, you know, you know, when you're, you know, if you were like, you know, pre-debut VTuber...

13
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:54,540
you usually get, you know, a couple of months... I didn't get... I didn't have the luxury of a couple of months to come back here.

14
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:04,520
I had like, I don't know, you know, a couple of days... so I'm like... I'm like speedrunning stuff right now.

15
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,400
So, yeah, there's a lot.

16
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,420
But hey, it's crazy!

17
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,140
We have like...

18
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:16,100
We hit monetize- I was so surprised that we hit monetization.

19
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:22,780
We actually- okay, I didn't tell the story because like, we actually hit monetization.

20
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:30,140
Like, um, like, like being applicable to apply for monetization before my first stream.

21
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,520
Also, oh my god, thank you all for the super chats!

22
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:37,360
Holy shit, thank you everybo- my chat died.

23
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,580
There you- what the fuck?

24
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:45,560
Okay, um, oh my god, thank you!

25
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,220
Oh, my chat's fucking dead.

26
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,700
There- there's just too much stuff going on.

27
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,460
My chat has died now, okay.

28
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,220
Alright, okay, whatever.

29
00:04:54,420 --> 00:05:04,560
Anyway, um, but yes, so like, I was applicable to apply for monetization before I even started my first stream.

30
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:09,180
And then after my first stream- okay, not even first, sorry.

31
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,560
My return stream.

32
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:14,780
I forgot there's other videos on this channel.

33
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:26,140
But anyway, after my return stream was done, like an hour or two later, um, I hit the, uh, they're like, you're monetized!

34
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,120
I was like, yay!

35
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,400
But there was a fucking catch.

36
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:40,560
Because whoever you were that fucking played Freebird in the middle of my stream!

37
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:47,340
Anyway, all proceeds of my return stream now goes to Freebird.

38
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:51,980
So, you know what?

39
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:58,460
Alright, to be fair, I had the option to mute Freebird.

40
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:07,240
But I had to- it was basically, like, if I mute Freebird, uh, we won't have the live chat replay.

41
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,560
I felt like, okay, this is good.

42
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,940
This is my first stream... return stream back.

43
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:19,980
So if I have a return stream back, I feel like we need to chat replay.

44
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:25,880
Because I figured... I found out... I was like, what the fuck is... where's my live chat replay?

45
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:33,980
So basically, if you try to mute... I thought it was like if you edit the vibe, you lose your live chat.

46
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:44,880
But apparently, if you mute your vibe or like anything regarding muting or replacing the audio, it counts as removing the live chat.

47
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:50,800
So I was just like, alright, we'll just... alright, you know what?

48
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,720
You deserve the money.

49
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:53,340
It's fine.

50
00:06:53,680 --> 00:07:00,800
You deserve... I was just like, it's fine.

51
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,080
You deserve it.

52
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:03,800
How did it...

53
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,080
play?

54
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:08,580
Well, I haven't touched the settings on my stream labs for a very long time.

55
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:15,100
And I forgot when I used to stream on Twitch, I had people submit like audio... like they can submit audio clips.

56
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:20,820
Or you guys can't do that here now because I replaced my alert box to my YouTube now.

57
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:27,220
So the alert box is not connected to my stream... like not connected to my Twitch stream labs anymore.

58
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,820
So now you can't fucking play Freebirds on stream anymore.

59
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,380
So this bot...

60
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:35,220
won't get demonetized.

61
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,360
I hope.

62
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:41,020
So we don't have to worry about demonetization via Freebirds.

63
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:41,940
So yeah.

64
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:48,860
I can't believe I got... this is exactly why I am fu... we were never gonna be Freebirds.

65
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:52,180
We're never going to be fucking Freebirds.

66
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:56,840
Because my return stream is demonetized.

67
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,600
Um...

68
00:07:59,060 --> 00:07:59,560
But yeah.

69
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,520
Oh my god.

70
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,260
There has been... I've been doing...

71
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:04,660
so much stuff.

72
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,200
Okay.

73
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,040
So...

74
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:09,080
It was a little bit naive of me to think...

75
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,980
That like... I was like...

76
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:13,140
Man... 50 orders...

77
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:14,520
is going to be a lot.

78
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,780
I was like... Oh my god.

79
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:18,760
If I get like...

80
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,240
just a little above 50 orders...

81
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,500
in the merch store...

82
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,340
That would be good enough for me.

83
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,600
Little do I know...

84
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,080
It was a little bit over 50.

85
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:32,680
You know?

86
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:33,740
I was like...

87
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,160
I literally...

88
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,540
put up the limited bundle...

89
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:41,420
for like...

90
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:43,300
less than 5 minutes...

91
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,960
and it was just gone.

92
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:47,600
I was like...

93
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,760
What?

94
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,600
I refreshed it.

95
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,700
I was like...

96
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:51,960
Huh?

97
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:53,480
Wait...

98
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:57,360
And then...

99
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,960
By the way...

100
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,840
Sorry I shot myself in the foot there.

101
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,120
Because like... the...

102
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:04,360
personalized messages...

103
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,520
I was going to write...

104
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,500
each postcard was going to be like...

105
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,800
a unique message for me.

106
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,320
And now I'm like... Okay.

107
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,660
It's 100 postcards.

108
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:13,560
That'll be fine.

109
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,560
I can just do this like...

110
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,900
It'll be a build up.

111
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,760
Now it's 200.

112
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,780
Now it's 200.

113
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,660
Oh my god.

114
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,520
Okay.

115
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,060
We'll make it through.

116
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:28,680
But yes.

117
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,660
This is like my first time opening...

118
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,240
my own big store.

119
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:33,520
So like...

120
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:36,360
It was so fucking naive of me...

121
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,520
to think that...

122
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,780
I was like... Okay.

123
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,700
We can open a store...

124
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,280
within like...

125
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,760
Because you know how you guys might think...

126
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,180
Oh she must have been planning on opening a store...

127
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:49,660
like... since like... 5 days.

128
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:50,180
I don't know.

129
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,060
When did I lost my job?

130
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:54,980
Sorry.

131
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,880
You know like...

132
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,540
You know...

133
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:00,340
That day.

134
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,480
But no.

135
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:02,280
It was...

136
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:04,580
2 hours.

137
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:06,740
2 hours...

138
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:08,140
before...

139
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,040
Uh...

140
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,400
2 hours before my return stream.

141
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,860
I was like... Mr. Man!

142
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,660
I don't have time to prep for my return stream...

143
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:18,800
and do my store.

144
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,580
Can you do the store?

145
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,940
And Mr. Man was like... Yeah.

146
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,380
I think I can do it.

147
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:26,120
And I was like... Mr. Man!

148
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,600
Do you think you can get it done while I'm streaming?

149
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,380
And he was like... Yeah.

150
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,340
And little did we know...

151
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,100
Running a store...

152
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,380
and getting a...

153
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:40,020
Running a store...

154
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:41,000
was...

155
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,020
Not knowing how many people were...

156
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,620
actually buying...

157
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:47,420
the products...

158
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:50,000
It was... It took longer...

159
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,460
than... you know...

160
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,800
It definitely took much longer...

161
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,200
than 4 hours to set...

162
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:56,980
everything up.

163
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:58,180
In fact...

164
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,900
It's crazy that we...

165
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:02,260
didn't manage to set all of this up...

166
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,680
within 3 days.

167
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:04,900
So...

168
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,540
So like... Okay.

169
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:07,920
So...

170
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,360
When we launched it...

171
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,480
For some reason... The shipping thing...

172
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:12,740
Yeah.

173
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,700
How hard could it be?

174
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:14,200
You know?

175
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:15,980
How hard could it be?

176
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,640
It was...

177
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,160
It was pretty difficult.

178
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:19,780
I...

179
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,320
It was...

180
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,240
It was pretty difficult.

181
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,560
Like... Yeah.

182
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,940
It was...

183
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:26,460
Okay.

184
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:27,140
So...

185
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:30,020
You know... Store launched...

186
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:32,240
And then we realized... The shipping...

187
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,340
was like... connected...

188
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:34,920
to...

189
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:38,860
Like... The shipp... When you buy a sticker...

190
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,700
For some fucking reason...

191
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,600
The shipping for stickers...

192
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,020
was like... $20.

193
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,620
And I was like...

194
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,880
Wait... That's not right...

195
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,500
I was like... I was like...

196
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,920
Uh... Mr. Man...

197
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,380
I'm getting reports that... Shipping is...

198
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,220
$20...

199
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:58,060
For a sticker...

200
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,280
And then...

201
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:01,680
It was...

202
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,140
My decision...

203
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,780
To pull the store down...

204
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,600
Immediately after we figured...

205
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,260
Found out... Because like... Mr. Man was like...

206
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:11,400
Oh yeah... We can try and fix it while the store is still up...

207
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,220
I was like... No...

208
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:15,580
Shut it down... Now... We need to fix this...

209
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:18,880
Cause like... I think like... At first we thought it was gonna be a quick fix...

210
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,400
But then like... We realized...

211
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,640
Wait... This is not a quick fix...

212
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,640
And I didn't wanna...

213
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,380
I really... Like... I really didn't wanna like...

214
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:27,700
Um...

215
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,400
Overcharge people...

216
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,500
On shipping as well...

217
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,220
Because like... Um...

218
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,300
I know how much shipping costs...

219
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,700
And... I just... I just didn't wanna...

220
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,600
Overcharge you guys for like...

221
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,540
These items... Cause like... You know...

222
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:43,700
You're willing to buy from me...

223
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,060
And you're willing to like...

224
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:47,160
Spend your money on me and everything...

225
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,580
And like... I don't wanna fucking... Like...

226
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:50,820
Um...

227
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:53,820
Overcharge you on the shipping... I want like... A fair price...

228
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,620
And then... Mr. Man was like...

229
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,980
You might have a loss if you don't know exactly...

230
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,780
Like... Like the shipping...

231
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,360
Thing... And I was like... I rather...

232
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,760
I rather take a tiny loss...

233
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,380
In shipping...

234
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:08,060
Um... Or instead of like...

235
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:10,020
Overcharging all of you guys...

236
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,220
Uh... In shipping...

237
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,860
And getting like... A... Like... A necessary profit...

238
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,120
From the shipping itself...

239
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,320
Um... So I wanted to make it...

240
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,040
As fair as possible...

241
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,480
Because I've like... Shipped pro...

242
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,960
I shipped products...

243
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:24,900
Uh...

244
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,680
Since I was a middle schooler...

245
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,380
And like... I've sold things since I was a middle schooler...

246
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:31,880
So I know like... The exact prices...

247
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,480
Of actual like...

248
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,360
Uh... Postal cost and everything...

249
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,380
So like... Cause like... Um...

250
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,000
Sometimes like... The weight...

251
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,140
Doesn't really correlate with like...

252
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:44,000
How much it actually costs at the post office...

253
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,820
So... I knew like...

254
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,560
Like... I... Because I had experience...

255
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,360
Shipping things... I knew like...

256
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,040
Yeah... That's not the actual...

257
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:53,500
Like... Price with the weight...

258
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,020
And like... I... Cause like...

259
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,460
Charms... It was like...

260
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:59,820
One charm... Like on the website...

261
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,260
One charm...

262
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:03,850
It... It made it... For Canadian shipping...

263
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,060
It was like...

264
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:06,880
$19...

265
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,020
Canadian...

266
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:11,640
And I was like... Okay... That's not right...

267
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,280
I was just like...

268
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:17,120
I was just like...

269
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,860
Wait a minute...

270
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:21,300
It should not be $19...

271
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,680
For one charm...

272
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,420
I was like... Okay... Wait...

273
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:27,200
A minute... But then...

274
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,660
I was like... Yeah...

275
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,100
That's a problem...

276
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,760
Originally... The... Um...

277
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,320
The bundles...

278
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,600
Was like... $60...

279
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,000
I was like... Wait a minute...

280
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,440
I know...

281
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,580
For sure...

282
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:46,000
It is not $60...

283
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,500
I was like...

284
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,760
In the United States... Cause like...

285
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,180
It's like... A...

286
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,960
Dokimakura cover...

287
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,660
With like... A quick charm...

288
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:55,880
And a quick stand...

289
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,060
I was like... There's no fucking way...

290
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:01,180
It's $60 to the United States...

291
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,960
I was like... I've shipped these before...

292
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,080
I... There's no...

293
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,820
Unless... Canadian...

294
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,340
Canada Post is like...

295
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,900
Fucking bankrupt...

296
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:12,400
Like... Inflation...

297
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,860
In the past 2-3 years...

298
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:17,020
Like... Okay... The Canadian dollar is...

299
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,140
Fucking garbage...

300
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:20,120
But it's not that bad...

301
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,280
Where it takes $60 fucking dollars...

302
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,920
To send to America...

303
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,020
Like... At that point...

304
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:29,120
Why the fuck are we living in Canada?

305
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:30,680
Like... At that point...

306
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,700
We should like... Not even sell anything...

307
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:35,060
To the States... Cause it's not even worth it...

308
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:37,940
Um...

309
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,060
Um...

310
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,740
But yeah... Anyway...

311
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,140
So... We had all...

312
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:44,080
So that's why it took us like...

313
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,440
4 to...

314
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,740
4 to 5 hours...

315
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,140
Cause we have to go through like...

316
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:52,380
Individually... Of like all...

317
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,840
The items to make sure...

318
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,940
Um...

319
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:58,120
To make sure...

320
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,640
Everything was like... Reasonable?

321
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,740
Um... Everyth...

322
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:04,800
No stop insulting...

323
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,920
Canada...

324
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:08,660
Look...

325
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:10,260
Look all Canadians...

326
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,540
Including myself will agree with me...

327
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,920
Um... Anyway...

328
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,260
So... Like...

329
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,660
We've accepted our...

330
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:20,020
We've accepted our place...

331
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,700
In the world... Um... But yeah...

332
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,120
So like... I tried really hard...

333
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,900
And then... And then after the shop...

334
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:29,340
Went back live... My mom came in and was like...

335
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:30,660
Was like...

336
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,720
Your shipping is too cheap...

337
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:38,770
My mom came in...

338
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:40,450
And was like... What are you doing?

339
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:41,790
What if...

340
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:43,470
What if it's too cheap?

341
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:45,890
And I was like... No... Don't worry...

342
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:48,050
I... Don't worry...

343
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:53,210
Um...

344
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,830
But yes... So... We've...

345
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:57,610
Expanded... Uh...

346
00:16:57,610 --> 00:16:59,690
We've expanded our team...

347
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:02,250
Our... Uh... Mr. Man team...

348
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,630
So now we have...

349
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:06,110
Mr. Man... Little Man...

350
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:07,630
And Consult Man...

351
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:09,570
So like... We... At first...

352
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,730
So it was gonna be Mr. Man...

353
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:13,970
And Little Man... And Little Man was...

354
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:15,990
Recruited... Uh... Because they have...

355
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:17,810
Experience running... Uh... Shopify...

356
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:19,130
Um...

357
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:21,610
And so... And they...

358
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:23,910
Wrote... Like all the terms of service...

359
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:25,810
And are doing customer support...

360
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:27,590
And... Like the...

361
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:29,910
Privacy policy... They wrote all of that...

362
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:31,930
And then... So then... But then when we...

363
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:34,090
Did our first... Launch...

364
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:36,090
Uh... The first launch... That was at...

365
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:38,030
12... Uh... We realized...

366
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:39,830
That like... There were problems...

367
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:41,910
There were issues with like... Worldwide shipping...

368
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:43,650
And... Um...

369
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:45,690
And everything... So then we...

370
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,570
Uh... Mr. Man recruited...

371
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:49,670
Consult Man... So...

372
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:51,990
Consult Man... Um... Is also...

373
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:53,910
Used to work at Shopify...

374
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:56,290
And they also like... Was helping us figure out...

375
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:58,170
Why we weren't doing... We weren't...

376
00:17:58,170 --> 00:17:59,350
Able to have worldwide shipping...

377
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:02,230
As well as like... Like you know... Like the credit card issue...

378
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:04,050
Apparently... Uh... For those who are...

379
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:05,510
Wondering why your...

380
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:08,290
Your country isn't in... Um...

381
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:09,850

00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:12,150
In like the shipping stuff...

383
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:14,310
Yet... It's like... It's like a gradual thing...

384
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:16,150
So later on... They'll like...

385
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:17,930
You'll... It's like a Shopify thing...

386
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:19,870
So later on... More and more countries...

Will be like... Eligible... Um...

388
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:24,390
So it just takes a gradual time...

389
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:26,050
Um... And I wanna say like...

390
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:27,570
A huge thank you to the team...

But like... We refunded like... 480 orders...

420
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:27,890
Um...

421
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:30,210
That accidentally paid way too much...

422
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,930

423
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:33,630

00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,270
For those who are wondering why I haven't opened up...

427
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:42,050

Wondering why I haven't opened...

Amberships yet...

432
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:51,730
Um... It is because... Um...

433
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:54,010
I had to do this...

434
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:55,210
I had to do the...

435
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:57,450
Merch stuff... So...

436
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,990
Uh... There's a lot of work into like...

437
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,790
Getting everything for the...

438
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:04,090
Amberships... So I couldn't...

439
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:06,090
Uh... I didn't really have the time to...

440
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:07,530
Because you have to write a lot of stuff...

441
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:09,170
And I was like... Oh my god...

442
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:11,190
There's not enough time...

443
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:13,910
There's not enough time right now... But anyway...

444
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:15,430
Um...

445
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:17,530
Fuck... What was the story before?

446
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:20,350
Fuck... Okay... Anyway... Regarding the story...

447
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:22,090
Uh... The funny thing...

448
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:24,190
Is that... Oh no... It's not funny...

449
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:25,590
But like... Okay... It's a little funny...

450
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:28,350
I was like... Freaking out... Because I am a huge...

451
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:30,190
Perfectionist... So I was like...

452
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:31,930
What the fuck is going on?

453
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:34,210
And I was like... Why are they...

454
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:35,690
Paying $20...

455
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:37,770
For shipping... For a...

456
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:39,430
Fucking sticker...

457
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:41,850
And then like... I was like...

458
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:43,790
Take the site down... Now...

459
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:45,270
I don't wanna scam... I don't wanna...

460
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:48,090
Scam anybody... Like...

461
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:49,830
Um... They gave so much to me...

462
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:52,070
I don't wanna... I wanna make sure everything is...

463
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:53,810
Fair... And then...

464
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:55,630
Um... And then I was like...

465
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:57,670
I was like... Like... I'm sorry...

466
00:20:57,670 --> 00:21:00,070
Mr. Man... For... For being...

467
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:01,690
So harsh... Like...

468
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:04,230
I was just very overwhelmed...

469
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:05,590
And... I also...

470
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:08,270
Did not sleep... At all...

471
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:09,990
And then... Um...

472
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:11,350
You know what Mr. Man said?

473
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:13,330
Mr. Man was like...

474
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:15,610
Don't worry... I've managed...

475
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:16,710
XQC...

476
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:19,630
This is nothing...

477
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,460
He was like...

478
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:28,200
No matter what... I'll never...

479
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,140
Reach that level...

480
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:34,060
So I was just like...

481
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,660
Oh shit... You know what?

482
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,300
You're right... No matter what I say...

483
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,320
To you... You've already been...

484
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,180
Hardened by your time...

485
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,480
Managing...

486
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:45,960
XQC... He doesn't manage...

487
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:48,100
Him anymore... He used to be...

488
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,520
His manager...

489
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,600
So I was just like...

490
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,260
I was just like... You know what?

491
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:54,120
You're right...

492
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,100
No matter what... I would...

493
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,400
Never... I would...

494
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,700
Never be as bad...

495
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,880
When it comes to that...

496
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,500
Um... So...

497
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,300
I was like... Oh thank god...

498
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,640
Anyway... The team...

499
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,960
I'm just really thankful... Because Mr. Man has like...

500
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,920
A lot of experience...

501
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,820
And a lot of like...

502
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:15,780
Uh... A lot of like...

503
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,900
I guess like experience and connections...

504
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,080
And everything... Because...

505
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,520
When we brought in Consult Man...

506
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,540
Because I was like...

507
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:26,080
No the shipping... The shipping has to be...

508
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,620
Cheaper... I can't deal with...

509
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:29,960
I know... Because at first...

510
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:32,240
After we got rid of $20...

511
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,060
We went with $17...

512
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:35,400
And then I was like... No!

513
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,200
That is still too expensive!

514
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,580
But it was on the...

515
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:41,400
Shopify thing... Like the...

516
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,500
Shopify was like...

517
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:45,840
Defaulting to that... And then...

518
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:46,620
Um...

519
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,900
And then... I was... And then they were like...

520
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,180
But it's gonna be a lot... So I was like... No!

521
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:51,720
I know...

522
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,500
Stickers are not fucking...

523
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,140
$17...

524
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,060
Because it's literally paper...

525
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,260
Where the fuck...

526
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:01,980
Is the weight in fucking...

527
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,820
Paper... So then...

528
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:06,260
Um... Consult Man was helping with like...

529
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:08,300
The Shopify thing... And then they were like...

530
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:10,020
No you have... Like... And then...

531
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:12,400
When I had so many questions and stuff like that...

532
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,940
And then... Uh...

533
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:16,120
Consult Man... Um... Actually...

534
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:17,860
It works for Ludwig...

535
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:20,060
Um... And...

536
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:21,760
Uh... They were like...

537
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,440
Don't worry... Consult Man has experience...

538
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,800
And then I was like... Yeah...

539
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,140
But Ludwig doesn't sell VTuber...

540
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:28,680
Products...

541
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,460
I was like...

542
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:34,040
I was like...

543
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:36,620
I don't think Ludwig sells VTuber...

544
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:37,400
Products...

545
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,900
And I know paper is not...

546
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,440
$17...

547
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:44,400
So...

548
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:45,820
Um...

549
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,780
So like...

550
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:49,440
I was like... Please...

551
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:52,180
Trust me on this... Like... I know...

552
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,780

00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:13,980
Tomorrow, we will be celebrating Lunar New Year.

740
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:16,920
I think it's going to be like at 5pm PST tomorrow.

741
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,060
We're going to be celebrating Lunar New Year.

742
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:23,360
And then, I think I'll be opening my membership tomorrow as well.

743
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,760
Because I want to do Garfield Cart next week.

744
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:34,420
I want to do Garfield Cart next week in members.

745
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:39,220
So I really want to open my membership by then.

746
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:39,760
So we can...

747
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:40,880
We can play Garfield Cart.

748
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,200
Um...

749
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:43,680
And...

750
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,760
Yeah, like...

751
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,620
There's just...

752
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:48,100
There's so many things going on.

753
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:50,740
But yes, thank you everybody for the super chat.

754
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:51,660
Thank you.

755
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:54,340
Thank you everyone for the support.

756
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:56,780
And thank you everybody for just...

757
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:59,160
Ah, it's just crazy.

758
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,100
It's still...

759
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:02,360
It's still super surreal and everything.

760
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:03,780
Um...

761
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:04,700
That's going on.

762
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:08,080
And also for those who are like, Are we getting our names yet?

763
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:09,240
Are we going to...

764
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,400
Are we going to be finally named?

765
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:12,600
Um...

766
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,140
No.

767
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:19,720
I'm sort of enjoying guys like battle royaling out right now.

768
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:25,200
And like fighting each other on which is the best name to represent you guys.

769
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:29,240
And also like I feel like I'm way too tired to pick a name today.

770
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,960
I did not...

771
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:35,380
I did not really have a chance to like actually look through all the names.

772
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:38,540
So I'm going to give you guys one more day.

773
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:42,100
And tomorrow on Lunar New Year.

774
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:45,040
Yes, you guys are nameless for another day.

775
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:47,800
So you guys are nameless for another day.

776
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:50,500
You guys still have to fight each other for one more day.

777
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:54,080
Because by God, I love seeing you all fight.

778
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:54,720
And...

779
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:57,680
Um...

780
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:03,020
But tomorrow we're going to not only decide the name.

781
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,760
But also we are going to be...

782
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,520
Finally I'm going to draw you guys.

783
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,640
We're going to draw a mascot.

784
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:15,280
A fan mascot to represent all of you tomorrow as well.

785
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:18,440
So that's what to look forward to.

786
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:18,820
You know what?

787
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:19,820
I'll tell you guys my schedule.

788
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:22,680
I fucking worked all night on it yesterday night.

789
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:25,700
So I might as well tell you guys my schedule.

790
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:27,120
Anyway, so...

791
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,200
Um...

792
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:32,860
Obviously, we're going to have Neopets on...

793
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:34,320
I'm taking Sunday off.

794
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:36,820
Because holy fuck.

795
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,500
I hope I reset my schedule by then.

796
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:42,780
But Monday is going to be Neopets at 5pm PST.

797
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:47,920
Tuesday will be the new season Apex launch.

798
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,840
I actually play tested this!

799
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:51,680
Oh my God!

800
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:54,600
Keeping that a secret for so long.

801
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,920
And like I also saw...

802
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:57,320
I was...

803
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:59,120
They invited me to see...

804
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,820
Like look at like the updates and everything.

805
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,860
So I actually...

806
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:05,880
I waited so long to be like...

807
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:06,640
I was there!

808
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:07,840
I play tested!

809
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,320
I tested...

810
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:09,400
Um...

811
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:12,040
All the updates for the new season.

812
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,000
Um...

813
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:14,960
And...

814
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:15,840
That was...

815
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:16,380
I'm...

816
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:17,780
It's going to be great.

817
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:18,520
It's going to be...

818
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:18,880
Haha!

819
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:20,080
It's like...

820
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,680
It's like...

821
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,320
They were...

822
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,000
Wait, did they...

823
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,300
Okay, I don't actually know what's actually been announced.

824
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,160
On what...

825
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:26,420
Okay.

826
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,520
The actual...

827
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,360
The Apex players out there.

828
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:30,500
What did they announce?

829
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:31,780
Because I didn't read any articles.

830
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:36,400
I know they announced some stuff of what's going to be in the new season.

831
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,260
But like...

832
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:38,600
I don't know how to read.

833
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:39,620
That's my...

834
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:40,840
Mr. Man's job.

835
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:41,700
Uh...

836
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:42,920
So like...

837
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,740
What did they already tell you guys?

838
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:45,660
Because I don't want...

839
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:46,180
Like...

840
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:46,820
Oh no!

841
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:47,540
Doki...

842
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:49,960
We can't invite Doki anymore.

843
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:51,500
Because...

844
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:52,780
Because she...

845
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:53,560
She...

846
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:59,080
She leaked the fucking Apex patches before it came out.

847
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,360
Oh, they showed the perks?

848
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:00,840
Yeah!

849
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,320
So it's like MOBA-ish.

850
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:02,900
Okay.

851
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:03,520
So...

852
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,300
It's basically like...

853
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:05,840
Uh...

854
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:06,380
The MOBA...

855
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:08,380
Like MOBA stuff.

856
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:09,880
So like you didn't get to pick the...

857
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,980
The upgrades and stuff like that.

858
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:12,920
And it's...

859
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:13,580
It's like...

860
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:14,560
Um...

861
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,060
It's...

862
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:15,760
It's very fun.

863
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:16,920
It's very interesting.

864
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:17,760
And very fun.

865
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:19,540
Um...

866
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:21,500
I was able to test that out.

867
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:22,180
Playtest that.

868
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:24,480
And I'm so happy it's finally live.

869
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:25,860
Uh...

870
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:29,620
Because I've been waiting to see that on live for so long.

871
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:30,440
Anyway!

872
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:31,420
But also!

873
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:32,760
The best part!

874
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:36,100
I can finally play Warner Brothers.

875
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:36,360
I can finally play Warner Brothers.

876
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:36,600
I can finally play these games.

877
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:38,000
Because...

878
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,580
What can they do to me?

879
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:45,260
Which means!

880
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:51,120
I can finally play Batman Arkham Asylum!

881
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:55,220
Which is a game I've been wanting to play for fucking ever!

882
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:58,180
I've never played any...

883
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:58,660
I actually...

884
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:00,100
I very much...

885
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:02,320
Very much enjoy like DC.

886
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,180
Like I am a...

887
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:04,760
Like...

888
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:08,320
I'm sorry for all you like Marvel fanboys out there.

889
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:10,880
But like I'm not like a...

890
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:14,400
I don't really like Marvel lore much.

891
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:16,560
I very much enjoy...

892
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,040
I always...

893
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:17,840
I talked about this before.

894
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:21,880
But I enjoy like DC comics and the DC movies.

895
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:23,120
The anime ones.

896
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:24,480
Like not the live action.

897
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:24,900
That...

898
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:26,880
That shit was just a little too sad.

899
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:34,480
Because Warner Brothers is now owned by someone that doesn't really give a fuck about good movies.

900
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:34,740
Like...

901
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:36,200
So...

902
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:37,980
The new...

903
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:39,000
I can say it now!

904
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,000
The new...

905
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,280
What is he gonna do?

906
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,580
What is he gonna do?

907
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:48,460
Try and delete my channel like they did to Wile E.

908
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:48,920
Coyote?

909
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,040
But anyway...

910
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,360
For tax breaks?

911
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:00,620
But anyway, yeah like...

912
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:03,960
I really do enjoy the anime.

913
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:04,560
The animated...

914
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:09,000
The animated DC movies and the...

915
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,500
And like just the comics from DC as well.

916
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:12,960
So...

917
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:13,740
I'm so happy!

918
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:16,860
I can finally play Backman Arkham Asylum.

919
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:20,120
It's actually one of the games I've been dying to play for the longest time.

920
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:21,660
No!

921
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,640
Who can stop me?

922
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:26,520
He's too busy dealing with like real matters.

923
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,820
Like finding ways to...

924
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:30,180
To get more tax breaks.

925
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:33,220
Like who the fuck cares about this random anime girl?

926
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:37,420
Um...

927
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:39,600
Um...

928
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,580
Anyway...

929
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:41,300
Uh...

930
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:43,320
Yeah, that's gonna be on Tuesday.

931
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:47,660
So it's gonna be like the Apex launch and also Batman Arkham Asylum.

932
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:48,720
And...

933
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,220
Uh...

934
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:51,680
And then!

935
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:57,220
On February 14th, it's time to celebrate a very important holiday.

936
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:59,920
I hope you guys did not forget.

937
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,260
But it is...

938
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:03,200
Happy Anniversary!

939
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:03,880
It's Amber's Day!

940
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,760
It's gonna be his birthday!

941
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,340
Because that's the most important holiday.

942
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:14,000
So February 14th is Amber's birthday.

943
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:20,420
And then on the 15th, we are going to have an Apex collab with Ditto.

944
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:23,680
And question mark, question mark, question mark third.

945
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:25,020
Um...

946
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:26,560
It might be Uto.

947
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:28,300
I'm not sure yet.

948
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:29,220
So...

949
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:29,800
Uh...

950
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,340
We're confirming that today.

951
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,980
And then Friday...

952
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:37,160
We're gonna be doing Inside the Backrooms with Usan.

953
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:38,480
Um...

954
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,240
And finally, Saturday is...

955
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:41,720
Members Garfield Card!

956
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:43,220
Yay!

957
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,260
The one to look forward to the most!

958
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:48,080
Yeah!

959
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,440
Um...

960
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,160
So...

961
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,360
It's a packed week.

962
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:53,980
I've...

963
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:57,300
I fucking miss streaming so much.

964
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,000
So...

965
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,880
I was so ready to like...

966
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,660
Pack it up with everything.

967
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:04,280
And...

968
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:04,940
Uh...

969
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:05,700
I'm just...

970
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,040
I'm just so happy to be streaming again.

971
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,060
It's actually...

972
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:10,900
I'm just really, really, really, really happy...

973
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,660
To stream again.

974
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:13,560
And...

975
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,200
Just talk to you guys.

976
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,140
Um...

977
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:16,660
And everything.

978
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:20,040
You guys have no idea how much I miss this.

979
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:21,160
Holy shit.

980
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,060
I...

981
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:22,620
It's just...

982
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:25,340
I'm just so happy to be able to do this again.

983
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:26,560
Um...

984
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,340
And I'm so tired too.

985
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,160
I'm so...

986
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,300
I'm on like...

987
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:32,120
I don't know if it's like noticeable.

988
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,440
But like...

989
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:36,040
I'm on two cans of coffee right now.

990
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,060
I'm so fucked up right now.

991
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:40,940
I'm actually so fucked up right now.

992
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:42,120
Oh my god.

993
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:43,100
I'm...

994
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:44,420
Oh my god!

995
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:47,300
I can play so many stupid fucking games too.

996
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:48,220
Holy shit.

997
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:48,720
It's...

998
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:49,020
It's...

999
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:50,180
I can actually just be like...

1000
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:51,160
What do I wanna play today?

1001
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,060
And it'd be like...

1002
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:52,360
Whoa!

1003
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,600
This game...

1004
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,300
Or that game...

1005
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,420
Is actually crazy.

1006
00:38:58,460 --> 00:38:59,020
I...

1007
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:01,600
Knowing what I can play now...

1008
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,100
I...

1009
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:02,920
How do I play later?

1010
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,340
And then...

1011
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:07,220
Oh my gosh.

1012
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:12,660
I'm planning where in my channel is gonna be heading to.

1013
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:13,460
Like...

1014
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:15,200
Recently I've been like...

1015
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,980
Hitting up some animators and stuff like that.

1016
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:19,220
And...

1017
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:23,120
Like I said like shorts are coming back very very very very soon.

1018
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:24,700
Just...

1019
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:28,020
Just setting up the server for my editors.

1020
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:29,340
And...

1021
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:29,660
Ah!

1022
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,080
There's so much to look forward to and then I have to...

1023
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:42,060
I have to fucking make a proposal thing for Mr. Man on like all the tournaments and projects and events I want to do as well.

1024
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:43,820
So I have to do that too.

1025
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:47,020
It's like every day there's so much work.

1026
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:53,620
And honestly I... oh my gosh I'm the happiest when I get to just work.

1027
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:56,820
I am just such a workaholic and it's crazy.

1028
00:39:57,120 --> 00:40:01,260
I can't believe my therapist is gonna be like, Wow Doki you're...

1029
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:13,820
My therapist is gonna enjoy hearing this because before all of this, all my therapist heard was me being like, I'm so fucking sad.

1030
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:27,760
Before all this, all he heard was just me being like, I'm sad, I'm angry, I'm empty inside.

1031
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,020
And now...

1032
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:29,320
NOW!

1033
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:29,740
Now!

1034
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,440
Now it's gonna be different!

1035
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,980
Instead it's gonna be like, I'm stressed.

1036
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:36,060
There's so much work.

1037
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,820
I haven't been sleeping.

1038
00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:49,360
Oh my god.

1039
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:51,780
But thank you everybody.

1040
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:57,940
Thank you everyone for all the super chats guys and all the people that ordered merch.

1041
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,560
Oh I can't...

1042
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:00,220
I'm so...

1043
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:00,680
I'm just...

1044
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:01,860
I'm just so excited.

1045
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:02,800
Um...

1046
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,100
And I...

1047
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:04,840
I...

1048
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:05,520
Like I...

1049
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,620
I know I keep saying it but...

1050
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:11,500
You guys just give me so much hope right now.

1051
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:12,600
And...

1052
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,700
It's just...

1053
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:14,480
It's just crazy.

1054
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:17,820
I never expected to see all this support.

1055
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:23,580
And I know I keep saying it but like I need to say it again and again because...

1056
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:27,680
It feels so fucking surreal right now and...

1057
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,520
I'm just so happy.

1058
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:29,960
I...

1059
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:32,380
I haven't been happy for a long time.

1060
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:33,960
And I'm...

1061
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,000
I'm happy.

1062
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,420
I'm happy right now.

1063
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:39,080
But also I have an underlying fear or two.

1064
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,400
I do.

1065
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:45,920
I do have an underlying fear.

1066
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:48,240
And I'm like, what if I fail?

1067
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:49,840
That's scary.

1068
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:51,440
That's scary.

1069
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:53,520
Oh my god.

1070
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:55,520
Um...

1071
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:56,520
But yeah.

1072
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:57,400
Anyway.

1073
00:41:58,760 --> 00:41:59,360
Anyway.

1074
00:41:59,360 --> 00:41:59,500
Anyway.

1075
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:00,760
I was so...

1076
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,920
I was just so...

1077
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,540
So surprised like...

1078
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:06,790
Uh...

1079
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,020
Like all the people...

1080
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:12,160
Like just the talented team that's helping me too.

1081
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:15,580
It's actually insane and how on top of things they are.

1082
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:17,640
Oh...

1083
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:19,860
Thank you everyone.

1084
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:21,480
Anyway.

1085
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:23,320
Anyway.

1086
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:25,920
That's really all I want to say.

1087
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:41,160
I really just wanted to update you guys on like what the fuck is going on right now.

1088
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:46,260
And like I felt really bad that like I didn't like really...

1089
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:50,020
I know like I just got back and then I was like I need a stream.

1090
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:52,680
I really fucking need to stream.

1091
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:55,940
And then I was like okay I finished the store.

1092
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:58,980
Okay now I can stream because like I was like...

1093
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:00,120
I thought...

1094
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:02,660
I didn't know when the store was actually going to come back.

1095
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:04,520
So I was just like okay we got...

1096
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:07,040
We gotta figure all this out before I put a stream time.

1097
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:10,520
Because I'm worried that we're gonna still be working on the store afterwards.

1098
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,300
But now it's done.

1099
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,620
And I was like okay I need to give them a life update.

1100
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:18,860
I need to let them know like what's going on in my life now.

1101
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:20,020
Um...

1102
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:24,300
But yes I know on the other side of the world there's also Lunar New Year right now.

1103
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:24,880
Yeah!

1104
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:26,800
Congratulations everyone.

1105
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:28,280
See you soon.

1106
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:32,260
But yes Happy Lunar New Year on the other side of the world.

1107
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:33,020
Um...

1108
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:35,580
I'll be celebrating Lunar New Year on my end.

1109
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:36,120
Uh...

1110
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:39,000
For tomorrow because that's when it's Lunar New Year tomorrow.

1111
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:40,720
So um...

1112
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,780
I can't wait to celebrate all of that with you guys.

1113
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:45,840
And that's also when we are uh...

1114
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:48,500
Deciding on finally the name.

1115
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:51,140
And also what you guys look like.

1116
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:54,160
So I'm gonna be drawing you guys as well for tomorrow.

1117
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:55,300
Um...

1118
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:55,880
And everything.

1119
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:58,180
So that's what to look forward to.

1120
00:43:58,300 --> 00:43:58,600
But yes.

1121
00:43:58,660 --> 00:43:59,400
Thank you again.

1122
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,820
I know this is such a super duper uh...

1123
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:03,440
Super duper short stream.

1124
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:05,920
Um...

1125
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:06,820
But...

1126
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:08,920
I'm gonna fucking pass out.

1127
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:11,160
We're not going to fucking...

1128
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:14,060
I'm gonna fucking pass out.

1129
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:17,800
Because those two cups of coffee...

1130
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:19,240
It's hitting...

1131
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:19,780
The...

1132
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:23,500
The crash is hitting very very soon.

1133
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:28,520
It's hitting very very soon.

1134
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:29,000
I could...

1135
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,180
I could feel it right now.

1136
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:31,120
And like...

1137
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:31,900
I need you guys to know...

1138
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:33,960
We are not fucking being freebirds.

1139
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:38,960
Because of what the fu- Because of what freebirds did to my stream.

1140
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:40,060
But...

1141
00:44:40,490 --> 00:44:41,200
I was...

1142
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:42,560
At first I was like...

1143
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:42,940
Mmm...

1144
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:45,020
Maybe we won't be freebirds.

1145
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:46,160
But now...

1146
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:48,840
Definitely not freebirds.

1147
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:50,860
Um...

1148
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:51,560
But yes.

1149
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:52,200
Thank you everybody.

1150
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:54,540
I'm so sorry this is like an incredibly short stream.

1151
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:57,740
I did want to do a longer one today.

1152
00:44:57,860 --> 00:44:58,740
But like...

1153
00:44:59,000 --> 00:44:59,780
You know...

1154
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:01,960
Me drinking two cups of coffee...

1155
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:02,760
To be like...

1156
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:03,580
No I'll be fine.

1157
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:06,700
The truth is...

1158
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:08,020
It was not funny.

1159
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:09,180
It was not...

1160
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:10,880
It was not a good idea.

1161
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:13,020
But thank you everyone.

1162
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:14,940
Thank you again for all the super chats everybody.

1163
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:15,800
Thank you.

1164
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:18,480
I wish I could thank you guys individually.

1165
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:19,740
But thank you all.

1166
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:22,920
And thank you all for purchasing the merch as well.

1167
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:25,120
I really...

1168
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:27,080
Really do appreciate it.

1169
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:28,600
Um...

1170
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:28,980
And...

1171
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:29,280
Yeah.

1172
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:30,940
Happy Lunar New Year.

1173
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:33,600
For those who are celebrating it right now.

1174
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:34,680
And thank you.

1175
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:35,260
Thank you.

1176
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:35,600
Thank you.

1177
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:35,920
Thank you.

1178
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:36,340
Thank you.

1179
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:36,520
Thank you.

1180
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:37,960
I really...

1181
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:42,400
I feel like every time I say thank you, it would never be enough.

1182
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:43,660
But I just want you guys to know.

1183
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:44,520
Like...

1184
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:45,520
Thank you.

1185
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:48,980
Anyway guys.

1186
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:51,180
I'm gonna fucking pass out now.

1187
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:52,760
As always everyone.

1188
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:53,980
Stay hydrated.

1189
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:55,460
Posture check.

1190
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:58,200
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

1191
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:00,360
And if you stayed up for me.

1192
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:01,640
Head to bed.

1193
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:03,560
Cause you deserve it.

1194
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:05,000
I'll see you guys next time everybody.

1195
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:06,600
Bye guys.

1196
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:07,800
Bye.
