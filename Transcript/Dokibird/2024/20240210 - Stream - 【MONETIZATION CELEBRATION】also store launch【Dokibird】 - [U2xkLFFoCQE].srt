Oh my chat's fucking dead.

20
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,280
There's just too much stuff going on My chat has died now.

21
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:52,680
Okay.

22
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:53,620
All right.

23
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,040
Okay.

24
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:54,420
Whatever.

25
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:55,160
Anyway.

26
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,500
Um, but yes.

27
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:04,820
So like I was applicable to apply for monetization before I
even started my first stream.

28
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,620
And then after my first stream.

29
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:08,020
Okay.

30
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:08,840
Not even first.

31
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:09,400
Sorry.

32
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:10,840
My return stream.

33
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:12,780
I forgot.

34
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,980
There's other videos on this channel.

35
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:16,080
But anyway.

36
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,160
After my return stream was done.

37
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:20,000
Like an hour.

38
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:33,160
two later um i hit the uh they're like you're monetized i
was like yay but there was a fucking catch because whoever

39
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:46,860
you were that fucking played free bird in the middle of my
stream anyway all proceeds of my return stream now goes to

40
00:05:46,860 --> 00:06:02,880
free bird zone you know what all right to be fair i had the
option to mute freebird but i had to it was basically like

41
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:14,940
if i mute freebird uh we won't have the live chat replay i
felt like okay this is my first stream return stream back so

42
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:23,920
if i have a return stream back i feel like we need to chat
replay because I figured I found out I was like what a fuck

43
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:32,780
is where's my live chat replay so basically if you try to
mute even I thought it was like if you edit the vibe you

44
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:42,480
lose your live chat but apparently if you mute your vibe or
like anything regarding muting or replacing the audio it

45
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:51,100
counts as removing the live chat so I was just like all
right we'll just You know what?

46
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,880
Oh, you deserve the money.

47
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:53,600
It's fine.

48
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,420
You deserve it.

49
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:01,260
I was just like, it's fine.

50
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,240
You deserve it.

51
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,260
How did it play?

52
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:08,760
Well, I haven't touched the settings on my stream labs for a
very long time.

53
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:15,340
And I forgot when I used to stream on Twitch, I had people
submit like audio, they can submit audio clips.

54
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:23,060
Or you guys can't do that here now because I replaced my
alert box to my my youtube now so the alert box is not

55
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:30,400
connected to my stream like not connected to my twitch
stream labs anymore so now you can't fucking play free birds

56
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:40,940
on stream anymore so this bot won't get demonetized i hope
so we don't have to worry about demonetization via free

57
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:51,060
birds so yeah i can't believe i got this is exactly why i am
but we were never gonna be free birds we're going to be

58
00:07:51,060 --> 00:08:04,420
fucking free birds because my return stream is demonetized
um but yeah oh my god there has been i've been doing so much

59
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:15,460
stuff okay so it was a little bit naive of me to think that
like i was like man 50 orders is going to be a lie i was

60
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:30,380
like oh my god if i get like just a 50 orders in the merch
store that'll be good enough for me little do i know it was

61
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:44,060
a little bit over 50 you know it was like i literally put up
the limited bundle for like less than five minutes and it

62
00:08:44,060 --> 00:09:00,540
was just gone I was like what I refreshed it I was like huh
wait wait what and then by the way it was I sorry I've like

63
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:07,680
shot myself in the foot there because like the personalized
messages is that I was I was gonna write like each postcard

64
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:14,900
was gonna be like a unique message from me and then now I'm
like okay it's a hundred postcards be fine i can just do

65
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:26,900
this like like it'll be a build-up but then i'm loud now
it's 200 so now it's 200 oh my god okay we'll make it

66
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:37,020
through um but yes this is like my first time opening my own
big store so like it was so fucking naive of me to think

67
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:46,740
that i was like okay um we can Because you know how you guys
might think, oh, she must have been planning on opening a

68
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:49,820
store, like, since, like, five days.

69
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:50,300
I don't know.

70
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,280
When did I lost my job?

71
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,100
Sorry.

72
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,640
You know, like, you know, that day.

73
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:05,020
But no, it was literally two hours.

74
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:07,640
Two hours before...

75
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:12,760
Two hours before my return stream.

76
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:19,080
Um, I was like, Mr. Man, I don't have time to prep for my
return stream and do my store.

77
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:20,840
Can you do the store?

78
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,480
And Mr. Man was like, yeah, I think I can do it.

79
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,880
And I was like, Mr. Man, do you think you can get it done
while I'm streaming?

80
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,640
And he was like, yeah.

81
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,520
And little did we know running a store and getting a...

82
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:39,900
Running a store?

83
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:43,180
Well, not knowing how...

84
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,340
How many people are actually buying the products?

85
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:57,140
It was, it took longer than, you know, it definitely took
much longer than four hours to set everything up.

86
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:04,160
In fact, it's crazy that we even managed to set all of this
up within three days.

87
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:13,180
So, um, so like, okay, so when we launched it, for some
reason, the shipping thing, yeah, how hard.

88
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:28,660
could it be you know it was it was pretty difficult I it was
it was pretty difficult like yeah it was it was okay so you

89
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:39,320
know store launched and then we realized the shipping was
like connected to like the ship when you buy a sticker for

90
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:50,340
some fucking reason the shipping for stickers was like 20
and i was like wait that's not right i was like i was like

91
00:11:50,340 --> 00:12:04,820
uh mr man i'm getting reports that shipping is 20 for a
sticker and then it was my decision to pull the story down

92
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:11,180
immediately after we figured found out because like mr man
was like oh yeah we can try and fix it while the story is

93
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:17,680
still up I was like no shut it down now we need to fix this
because like I think like at first we thought it was gonna

94
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:25,980
be a quick fix but then like we realized wait this is not a
quick fix and I didn't want to I really like I really didn't

95
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:37,080
want to like um overcharge people on shipping as well
because like uh I know how much shipping costs and I just I

96
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:44,040
just didn't want to overcharge you guys for like these items
because like you know you're willing to buy from me and

97
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:51,900
you're willing to like spend your money on me and everything
and like I don't want to fucking like um overcharge you on

98
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,920
the shipping I wanted like a fair price and then mr.

99
00:12:55,080 --> 00:13:02,100
man was like you might have a loss if you don't know exactly
like like the shipping thing and I was like I rather I'd

100
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:12,160
rather take a tiny loss in shipping um or instead of like
overcharging all of you guys uh in shipping and getting like

101
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:20,980
a like a necessary profit from the shipping itself um so I
wanted to make it as fair as possible because I've like

102
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:29,980
shipped props I should yeah I shipped products uh since I
was a middle schooler and like I've sold things middle

103
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:37,440
school or so i know like the exact prices of actual like uh
postal costs and everything so like because like um

104
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:45,780
sometimes like the weight doesn't really correlate with like
how much it actually costs at the post office so i knew like

105
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:54,080
like i because i had experience shipping things i knew like
yeah that's not the actual like price with the weight and

106
00:13:54,080 --> 00:14:04,500
like i cause like the charms It was like one charm like on
the website one charm it made it for Canadian shipping it

107
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:20,580
was like $19 Canadian and I was like okay that's not right I
was just like I was just like wait a minute it should not be

108
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:35,340
$19 for one charm I was like okay wait a minute but then I
was like yeah that's a problem originally the um the bundles

109
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:48,880
was like sixty dollars I was like wait a minute I know for
sure it is not sixty dollars I was like in the United States

110
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:57,180
because like it's like a don't keep a crew cover with like
an acrylic charm and acrylic stand I was like, there's no

111
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:01,220
fucking way it's $60 to the United States.

112
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,420
I was like, I've shipped these before.

113
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:09,860
I, there's no, unless Canadian Canada Post is like fucking
bankrupt.

114
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:19,080
Like, like inflation in the past two to three years, like,
okay, the Canadian dollar is fucking garbage, but it's not

115
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:24,860
that bad where it takes 60 fucking dollars to send to
America.

116
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:29,280
Like, at that point, why the fuck are we living in Canada?

117
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:35,340
Like, at that point, we should, like, not even sell anything
to the States because it's not even worth it.

118
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:49,040
Um, uh, but yeah, anyway, so we had all, so that's why it
took us, like, four to, uh, four to five hours, because we

119
00:15:49,040 --> 00:16:00,020
have to go through, like, individually of, like, all, all
the items to make sure um to make sure everything was like

120
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:14,960
reasonable um everything no stop insulting canada look look
all canadians including myself will agree with me um anyways

121
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:25,040
so like we've accepted we've accepted our place in the world
um but yeah so like i tried really hard and then And then

122
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:32,300
after the shop went back live, my mom came in and was like,
was like, you're shipping is too cheap.

123
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:38,830
My mom came in.

124
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:40,610
I was like, what are you doing?

125
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:43,790
What if, what if it's too cheap?

126
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:45,770
And I was like, no, don't worry.

127
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:47,790
I don't worry.

128
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:56,590
Um, but yes, so we've expanded.

129
00:16:56,610 --> 00:17:10,210
uh we've expanded our team our uh mr man team so now we have
mr man little man and consult man so like we at first so it

130
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:19,150
was gonna be mr man and little man and little man was
recruited because they have experience running uh shopify um

131
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:29,390
and so and they wrote like all the terms of and are doing
customer support and like the privacy policy they wrote all

132
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:38,150
of that and then so then but then when we did our first
launch uh the first launch that was at 12 uh we realized

133
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:46,610
that like there were problems there were issues with like
worldwide shipping and um and everything so then we uh mr

134
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:56,330
man recruited consult man so consult man um is also used to
work at Shopify and they also like was helping us figure out

135
00:17:56,330 --> 00:18:01,930
why we weren't doing we weren't able to have worldwide
shipping as well as like like you know like the credit card

136
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:12,530
issue apparently for those who are wondering why your your
country isn't in um isn't uh in like the shipping stuff yet

137
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:19,350
it's like it's like a gradual thing so later on they'll like
you'll it's like a Shopify thing so later on more and more

138
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:26,970
countries will be like eligible um so it just takes a
gradual time um and i want to say like a huge thank you to

139
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:35,470
the team because they're working incredibly hard and they're
like updating everybody on um they're like updating

140
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:43,010
everybody uh on uh twitter as well like emails for anyone
that had questions like and anything and they're like

141
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:50,290
updating on like on real time too So, they're trying to make
sure everybody receives their order and everything.

142
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:59,490
And also, like, during those times, they, like, refunded
everybody that accidentally paid the $20 shipping for one

143
00:18:59,490 --> 00:18:59,970
sticker.

144
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:04,350
They, like, refunded, oh, my God.

145
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:10,750
They, like, refunded, like, oh, my gosh, wait, actually, I
can see it right now, how many orders they had to refund.

146
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:13,170
Because, like, we didn't want to, like, scam anybody.

147
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:14,890
I know some of you guys are like, no, take my...

148
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,570
Overpriced fucking shipping.

149
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:17,270
No, please.

150
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:20,210
I realize, no, don't do that to yourself.

151
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:23,390
Please love yourself like I eventually did.

152
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:32,850
But like we refunded like 480 orders that accidentally paid
way too much than it should be and everything.

153
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:37,110
By the way, I also thank you again, everybody, for the super
chat.

154
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:38,290
I can't believe it.

155
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:42,050
For those who are wondering why I haven't opened up
memberships yet.

156
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:42,610
Oh, sorry.

157
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:43,310
Ambership.

158
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:49,170
Sorry, for those who are wondering why I haven't opened
Amber Ships yet.

159
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:54,030
It is because I had to do this.

160
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:56,710
I had to do the merch stuff.

161
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:02,710
So there's a lot of work into getting everything for the
Amber Ships.

162
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:07,530
So I couldn't, I didn't really have the time to because I
had to write a lot of stuff.

163
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:11,170
And I was like, oh my god, there's not enough time.

164
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:13,050
There's not enough time right now.

165
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:13,730
But anyway.

166
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:16,410
Um, fuck.

167
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:17,730
What was the story before?

168
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:18,090
Fuck.

169
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:18,390
Okay.

170
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:25,570
Anyway, regarding the story, uh, the funny thing is that,
oh, no, he's not funny, but like, okay, it's a little funny.

171
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:29,290
I was like freaking out because I am a huge perfectionist.

172
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:32,270
So I was like, what the fuck is going on?

173
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:39,290
And I was like, why are they paying $20 for shipping for a
fucking sticker?

174
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:43,370
And then like, I was like, take the site down.

175
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:44,730
Now I don't want to scam.

176
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:51,090
I don't want to want to I don't want to scam anybody like um
they gave so much to me I don't want I want to make sure

177
00:20:51,090 --> 00:21:01,690
everything is fair and then um and then I was like I was
like like like I'm sorry Mr. Man for for being so harsh like

178
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:13,310
I was just very overwhelmed and I also did not sleep at all
and then um you know what Mr. Man said Mr. Man was like

179
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:19,430
don't worry I managed xqc this is nothing

180
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:37,540
he's like no matter what i'll never reach that level so i
was just like oh shit you know what you're right no matter

181
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:47,680
what i say to you you've already been hardened by your time
managing xqc he doesn't manage him anymore he used he used

182
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:57,400
to be his manager so i was just like i was just like you
know what you're right no matter what i would never i would

183
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:08,840
never be as bad when it comes to that um so so i was like oh
thank god anyway uh the team i'm just really thankful

184
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:17,500
because mr match has like a lot of experience and a lot of
like uh a lot of like i guess like experience and

185
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:24,860
connections and everything because uh when we brought in
consult man because i was like i was like no the shipping

186
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:34,620
the shipping has to be cheaper i can't deal with i know
because at first after we got rid of 20 we went with 17 and

187
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:44,400
then i was like no that is still too expensive but it was on
the shopify thing like the the shopify was like defaulting

188
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:52,720
to that and then um and then i was and then they're like but
it's gonna be a loss i was like no i know stickers are not

189
00:22:52,720 --> 00:23:05,020
fucking 17 dollars because it's literally paper where the
fuck is the weight in fucking paper so then um consultant

190
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:11,000
man was helping with like the shopify thing and then they're
like no you have like and then when like i had so many

191
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:23,500
questions and stuff like Consultman actually works for
Ludwig And they're like Don't worry, Consultman has

192
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:28,760
experience And now it's like, yeah But Ludwig doesn't sell
VTuber products

193
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:40,980
I was like I don't think Ludwig sells VTuber products And I
know paper is not $17

194
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:55,840
so um like so like i was like please trust me on this like i
know you work for ludwig but please trust me on this it has

195
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:00,240
to be two or three dollars because like it's paper

196
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:18,520
um so that's why now like uh the stickers are for shipping
is uh what could it be was based ah yes the ludwig daki

197
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:31,740
makura that i don't know i don't know about that um so yes
the it is it is a team but i really do appreciate i really

198
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:43,260
do appreciate the man team being made and uh and mr man
recruiting uh to very very very talented individuals that

199
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:54,760
definitely know what they're doing they fucking open a store
in three days that's like despite some scuff um and like you

200
00:24:54,760 --> 00:25:04,700
know some bugs and stuff um this is the first time we like
open like for me i open something like this so um like i've

201
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:16,040
done like small scale so like i've never done something this
big and like yes graphic design is mr man's passion uh but i

202
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:27,640
swear it will look like a real website soon we just didn't
have the time to set that up um so like at first uh mr man

203
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:40,260
made the header and it just says no head because the the er
got cut off and then my my friend One of my friends sent me

204
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:42,900
a screenshot and was like, what the fuck?

205
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,320
Why does this seem real bad?

206
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,820

actually i waited so long to be like i was there i play

00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:22,360
tested um all the updates for the new season um and that was
i'm it's gonna be great It's like, it's like, they were,

278
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:28,880
wait, did they, okay, I don't actually know what's actually
been announced on what, okay, the actual, the Apex players

279
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:35,300
out there, what did they announce, because I didn't read any
articles, I know they announced some stuff of what's going

280
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:44,380
to be in the new season, but like, I don't know how to read,
that's my Mr. Man's job, so like, what did they already tell

281
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:49,460
you guys, because I don't want, like, oh no, Doki, we can't
invite Doki.

282
00:33:49,480 --> 00:34:01,360
anymore because because she she she leaked the fucking apex
patches before it came out oh they showed the perks yeah so

283
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:10,600
it's like moba ish okay so it's basically like uh the moba
like moba stuff so like you didn't get to pick the the

284
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:20,680
upgrades and stuff like that and it's it's like um it's it's
very fun it's very interesting and very fun um i was able to

285
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:29,440
test that uh play test that and i'm so happy it's finally
live uh because i've been waiting to see that on live for so

286
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:40,100
long anyway but also the best part i can finally play warner
brothers games because what can they do to me

287
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:57,060
means I can finally play Batman Arkham Asylum which is a
game I've been wanting to play for fucking ever I've never

288
00:34:57,060 --> 00:35:07,860
played any I actually I very much very much enjoy like DC
like I am a like I'm sorry for all you like Marvel fanboys

289
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:19,320
out there but like I'm not like a I don't really like very
much enjoy I always I talked about this before but I enjoy

290
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:27,160
like DC comics and the DC movies the animated ones like not
the live action that that shit was just a little too sad

291
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:38,880
