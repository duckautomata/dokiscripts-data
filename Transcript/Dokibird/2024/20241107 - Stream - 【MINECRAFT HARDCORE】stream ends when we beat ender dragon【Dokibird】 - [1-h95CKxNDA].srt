1
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,040
Hello, everybody!

2
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:46,480
Hello!

3
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:46,820
Hello!

4
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:48,480
Buddy!

5
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:49,580
Welcome!

6
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:50,960
Oh, welcome!

7
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,760
So, um...

8
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:56,720
We have a server dedicated to our...

9
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,100
By the way, the sun is setting, by the way.

10
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:58,860
So...

11
00:01:58,860 --> 00:01:59,060
Oh!

12
00:01:59,100 --> 00:01:59,800
I'm going in!

13
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:00,900
I'm going in!

14
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:06,710
Oh my God.

15
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:07,730
Why are you out here?

16
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:08,350
Oh, thank God.

17
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:09,930
Because there were zombies around!

18
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:14,520
I'm literally...

19
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,560
I ate some zombie meat, so now I have...

20
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:16,980
Wait, what do you mean?

21
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:17,400
Now I'm okay.

22
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,600
I can't see your heart!

23
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:19,400
Yeah, you're right, you're right.

24
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:21,780
So, um...

25
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:22,100
Yeah.

26
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,260
So, this might be the fastest death, because it's already night.

27
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,160
I mean, we could dig a hole.

28
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:27,800
In the water?

29
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,620
I mean, we're literally right...

30
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:30,320
Oh, wait, what the fuck?

31
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,420
I'm in cinematic mode here.

32
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,160
Okay.

33
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:33,480
We gotta find a hole.

34
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:34,580
We gotta find...

35
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:34,820
Okay.

36
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:35,440
We'll find...

37
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,020
We could find a village, I'm sure.

38
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,220
Just avoid the zombies and everything.

39
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:41,940
Hey, guys!

40
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:45,280
Welcome to our hardcore Minecraft playthrough.

41
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:45,660
Yay!

42
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:47,100
So, midnight, we're talking...

43
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:51,440
Min apparently didn't realize what it meant when I said, like, hardcore Minecraft.

44
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,240
We stream until we beat that.

45
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,160
I knew what you meant.

46
00:02:55,160 --> 00:03:00,360
No, no, you were like, so what do we do if we die during the ender dragon fight?

47
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:00,640
No, no, no, I was just like...

48
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,980
And I was like, we restart.

49
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,300
Like, what do you mean, what do we do?

50
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:07,600
What do we do when we die in the ender dragon fight?

51
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,980
I was just like, you know, I was just like, oh my gosh, oh my god, I found a village!

52
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,040
Oh my god, there's a village!

53
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,880
Okay, okay, okay, I knew we were gonna find a village.

54
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:14,320
See, I told you.

55
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,000
I knew we were gonna find...

56
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,840
I told you.

57
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,880
Gamer instinct, I'm literally eating away.

58
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:23,040
No, you were like, this is literally 50-50, it was a life or death.

59
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,540
You were like, well, we die, we die.

60
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,500
No, I was totally... I know I did not say that.

61
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,160
I'm asleep, get your own bed, go...

62
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,780
I'm shutting the door, this is my home and I'm living here.

63
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,100
Okay, okay, I'm sleeping now too.

64
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,300
Oh my god, we already found beds, guys!

65
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,280
Yeah, we're doing so well.

66
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:44,560
It's so easy.

67
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,500
We already got our beds for the Minecraft.

68
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:49,560
Hardcore.

69
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,200
Yeah, easy.

70
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:53,560
So, we were inspired by...

71
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,440
Oh shit, I refreshed my game.

72
00:03:55,580 --> 00:04:03,400
We were inspired by the Kai and Spice Show Speed playthrough they did months ago where they...

73
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,340
I don't know, have you watched the playthrough, Mint?

74
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,420
No, I just... I don't even know who those people are.

75
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:13,240
Okay, so I was inspired by them and then I told Mint, let's do it.

76
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,240
Anyway, so I was inspired, I was watching a bit of it.

77
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:19,500
And it took them like 20 plus days, by the way, Mint.

78
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:21,520
It took them 20 plus...

79
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,520
In real time?

80
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,360
Yes, in real time.

81
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:28,360
They literally, like, they would go to bed, wake up, play Minecraft, and then die.

82
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:31,800
Go to bed, wake up, play Minecraft, die.

83
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:34,360
And then they kept doing it until they beat the...

84
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:35,760
I think we're better than them.

85
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:36,720
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

86
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,240
I was like, we must be better.

87
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:41,220
Like, we have to be better than them.

88
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,280
There's no way it's gonna take us...

89
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,920
That's why we gave ourselves one extra day.

90
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:58,420
We gave ourselves one extra day to see if we could beat Minecraft.

91
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,900
I think we could beat... Okay, like, where...

92
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,220
Do they even play Minecraft?

93
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:03,940
Do they even know anything?

94
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:06,720
Like, I don't... I don't know, that's the thing.

95
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:12,320
I just saw that it took them 20 fucking days to be there.

96
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,060
Wait, I need food.

97
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:15,900
Is there not food in this village?

98
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:19,560
Like, where are the food in this village?

99
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,200
Did you take all the food?

100
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:23,860
I'm looting!

101
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,240
What have you been doing this entire time?

102
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:26,840
I'm dying.

103
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,480
I'm literally dying right now.

104
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,860
What have you been doing this entire time?

105
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:33,140
I was trying to introduce the rules!

106
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:37,120
I was introducing what's going on.

107
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,060
Oh my god, how am I... I'm dying from fire.

108
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,600
Oh my god, wait, I could actually die in a sec.

109
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,960
You just spiked some damn food!

110
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:44,540
I'm fine, I'm fine.

111
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,260
You didn't even loot everything.

112
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,880
You're not even that great at looting.

113
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,840
I left you one house.

114
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:50,880
Oh, thank you.

115
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:52,980
Wow, I'm so fortunate.

116
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,380
Yeah, I left you a house for you, you know.

117
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:56,940
Wow.

118
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,040
Do you have any more food?

119
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,260
I only have two potatoes.

120
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,440
Oh, that's all they had?

121
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:06,800
Yeah, they have two potatoes and two bread.

122
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:07,480
I need more.

123
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:07,880
Trade me.

124
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:08,860
Trade me.

125
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,620
No, I'm gonna go here.

126
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,620
I have twelve emeralds.

127
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,320
I have a pumpkin seed.

128
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,380
How am I missing a health?

129
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,020
How are... because I don't fucking know.

130
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:19,780
What did you do?

131
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:20,960
I don't know.

132
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,040
Give me the fucking bread!

133
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:24,340
I'm eating!

134
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:25,760
This is a team game!

135
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:26,920
Get your own!

136
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,700
The moment I go kill myself, you have to restart the server.

137
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,000
And you lose everything!

138
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:33,280
You lose everything!

139
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,500
Look, just for yourself!

140
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,500
You can't eat the berries!

141
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,460
You cannot eat the berries!

142
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:37,620
Yes, you can!

143
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,500
You can eat the berries!

144
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,020
What do you mean you can't eat the berries?

145
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:41,500
Oh, wait, you can.

146
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,020
I told you!

147
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:48,280
I realized I just needed a piece of sky.

148
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:51,180
Yes!

149
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:51,660
See?

150
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:54,060
What are you collecting men in here for?

151
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,020
Collecting men?

152
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,080
What are you doing?

153
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,680
What the fuck are you doing?

154
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,880
Why are you collecting them like that?

155
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,840
People can see my stream and what I was doing.

156
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,760
They know I was not doing any of that.

157
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,960
Wait, can they actually... wait, did they do this themselves?

158
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:13,700
I think so.

159
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:17,680
Wait, oh, those are some freaky... freaky men.

160
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,060
This is a freaky village.

161
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:21,400
Yeah, this is a freaky village that you found.

162
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,980
Also, take their torches.

163
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,340
Oh, yeah, you're right, you're right.

164
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:27,960
Okay, so how do we... I forgot how to do the Ender Dragon.

165
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:28,940
It's been a while.

166
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,800
You're like the Minecraft expert.

167
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:34,040
I've beaten them like twice.

168
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,240
I was there too.

169
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,240
Actually, I watched a guide.

170
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,380
You watched a guide?

171
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:45,920
It was like, so you want to survive in Minecraft hardcore.

172
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,940
Kind of guide, and I watched that.

173
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:52,400
Oh my god, why am I lagging a little?

174
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,000
It's Minecraft.

175
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,060
Oh, it might be my resource packs.

176
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,240
Oh my god.

177
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,120
It could be.

178
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:05,660
It could be.

179
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,100
I don't know.

180
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:11,240
It could be the resource packs that I downloaded.

181
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,760
So I wanted to download...

182
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:20,820
The reason why we were waiting was because I was downloading resource packs to try and replace...

183
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:21,580
Yeah, it was always Doki's fault.

184
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,900
To try and...

185
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,620
Okay, that is not true.

186
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:26,580
That is not true.

187
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:29,140
When has it not been true?

188
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,900
No, no, that is not true.

189
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:37,300
The last time we had a collab, I knew I wasn't the reason why we're late.

190
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,640
What, like yesterday?

191
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,420
Yeah, that was not my fault.

192
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:44,560
I was actually on time.

193
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,060
Why were we late?

194
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:47,740
I don't even remember.

195
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,300
Because some people...

196
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:49,960
Because of the...

197
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,140
Oh wait, it was my fault because I chose the Tuesday.

198
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,960
I chose Tuesday at 3pm.

199
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:02,040
Also, the sound doesn't sound okay now.

200
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,380
You're over here, okay.

201
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:07,240
Alright, so what's the plan?

202
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,900
Should we start mining for diamonds?

203
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,960
No, Doki, no!

204
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:13,660
Why not?

205
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,620
We have to first start...

206
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,840
I'm trying to steal their ore.

207
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,760
Are you lagging that bad?

208
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,900
No, I'm trying to fucking...

209
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,900
Cut a tree so I can get stuff.

210
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,440
Oh my gosh, you should have looted better.

211
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,620
I thought you were a gamer.

212
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:30,900
I was freaking telling...

213
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,940
Oh, I cared about our fans.

214
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,340
Because I was worried that they were confused.

215
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:39,600
You have to be able to explain things and game at the same time.

216
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,020
No, no, no, no, no, no.

217
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:43,280
Because I wanted to be like...

218
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,760
Okay, my god, I didn't even put music on.

219
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,760
That's how angry I am.

220
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,360
That's why I'm angry.

221
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,480
There was no BGM.

222
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,780
It was just other silence.

223
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:00,060
I had to listen to her fucking voice.

224
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,820
Get used to it!

225
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:07,240
Oh my god, to fucking play this for like hours.

226
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,200
I'm literally gonna see you in like three days.

227
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,960
What do you mean three days?

228
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,920
However many days it is.

229
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,040
Yeah, I was gonna say.

230
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,860
So people thought that like...

231
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:26,400
You know you were on your schedule like Saturday.

232
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,980
People thought that we were actually gonna meet up on Saturday.

233
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:34,220
And then on my schedule it's like three different things.

234
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:41,640
How the fuck is she gonna do an off clap while she has this, this, this and that.

235
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:48,500
Sorry everybody, I made this a little whoopsie poopsie on my schedule.

236
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,560
Wait, so what are we supposed to do?

237
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:58,360
Okay, so first we gotta like get regular iron.

238
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:03,920
So basically, I think the best bet would be if we go into the mountains...

239
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,500
And we get the iron.

240
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,340
And we like...

241
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:10,160
Like the ones that aren't in the...

242
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,400
You know how you can find iron?

243
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,360
Not in the caves?

244
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

245
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,220
Oh, so you're scared then.

246
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,040
I'm not scared.

247
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:19,720
You're scared.

248
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:20,400
You don't wanna...

249
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:20,600
I'm literally trying to survive.

250
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,120
You don't wanna dig down.

251
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:22,940
You're scared.

252
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,340
I'm not scared.

253
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,160
We need the...

254
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:25,900
Then dig down.

255
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:28,000
Straight down?

256
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:28,880
Yeah, straight down.

257
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:29,920
Why don't we need to find a mountain?

258
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,220
Just dig down.

259
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:31,380
Okay.

260
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:32,840
Okay, I'll dig down right now.

261
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,460
Yeah, do it.

262
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:34,340
Alright, hold on.

263
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:35,280
Let me make a little...

264
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,320
Let me make a... Hold on.

265
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,320
I gotta make a shovel.

266
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:38,880
Yeah, let me help you.

267
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:39,080
You want me to dig down?

268
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:39,440
Okay.

269
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,520
Yeah, yeah, dig down.

270
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:41,440
I'm going.

271
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:41,840
Hold on.

272
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,320
Come on, are you fucking scared?

273
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:44,180
I'm not.

274
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:44,760
I'm trying to...

275
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:44,840
Are you scared?

276
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,620
Let me make a... Wait.

277
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:45,820
Are you scared?

278
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:46,880
Oh, there it is.

279
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,120
Where's my shovel?

280
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,040
Oh, wait.

281
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,320
I need sticks too.

282
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:51,360
How do I make sticks?

283
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,040
Oh, there we go.

284
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,440
Alright, come on.

285
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:54,160
Alright, dig down.

286
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:54,480
You too.

287
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,920
I'm hoping you...

288
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,480
Hey, what are you doing?

289
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,100
Come on.

290
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:00,500
Come on.

291
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:01,420
Come on.

292
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,440
Come on.

293
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:03,920
Come on.

294
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:04,400
Come on.

295
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,220
Dig down.

296
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:05,800
Your turn.

297
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:06,620
We're digging down.

298
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,380
We're digging down.

299
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:07,940
We're digging down.

300
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,700
Wait, I need to make a shovel too.

301
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,700
Oh, now you need a shovel.

302
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:12,340
Oh, yeah.

303
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,100
No, I don't.

304
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:13,700
I don't.

305
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,620
We'll just use your shovel.

306
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,500
Yeah, yeah, no, no.

307
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:15,860
You dig.

308
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:16,380
You dig.

309
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:16,900
You have a shovel.

310
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:17,640
Yeah, go.

311
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:18,400
Yeah, okay.

312
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:18,820
Let's go.

313
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,360
Yeah, okay.

314
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,720
While you do that, I'm gonna raise your volume a little bit more.

315
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:22,740
Okay, okay.

316
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,700
I'll talk louder.

317
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:24,860
Alright.

318
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:26,500
Keep going.

319
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:27,940
Alright.

320
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:28,580
Alright.

321
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:29,840
Oops.

322
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,540
Sorry, accident.

323
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:34,020
I don't have a pickaxe either because somebody was like...

324
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,060
Oh, I have one.

325
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:35,720
I have one.

326
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:35,920
I have two actually.

327
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,700
You wanna make me a pickaxe then?

328
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,780
You wanna make me one?

329
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:39,620
I don't think so.

330
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:40,180
I don't think so.

331
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:40,500
Oh, okay.

332
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,320
So, I guess I don't need to dig then.

333
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,320
I guess I'll just use the crafting table.

334
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:44,900
You'll just use your hands.

335
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,380
Yeah, I'll just use my hands.

336
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:47,100
That's fine.

337
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:47,820
Use your hands.

338
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,540
Use your hands.

339
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:48,980
That's fine.

340
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,220
Oh, oh, oh.

341
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,820
That must have been an accident too, right?

342
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:52,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

343
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,000
Oh, you're so clumsy.

344
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,500
I know, I know.

345
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,040
You're so, so clumsy.

346
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:58,860
Oh, I can't reach anymore.

347
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,640
I can't reach anymore.

348
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:04,980
Oh.

349
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:06,140
Oh.

350
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,260
I think we're safe down here.

351
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:09,940
Oh, what the hell?

352
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:10,580
How'd you get there?

353
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:11,300
I don't know.

354
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,080
I guess you didn't dig hard enough.

355
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:14,560
I'm digging down.

356
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,100
You keep digging my blocks and...

357
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,140
Yeah, sure, I will help.

358
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:19,060
It shows that you're too afraid to dig down.

359
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:22,420
No, no, because somebody won't let me fucking make a pickaxe.

360
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:24,180
Come here, come here, come here.

361
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,500
No, I'm making a pickaxe right now.

362
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,300
No, no, no, I'm making...

363
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:26,440
Oh, you are?

364
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,500
Oh, how are you making one?

365
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:28,460
How are you making one?

366
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:30,120
Because I don't...

367
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:30,160
Come here, come here.

368
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,660
No, I don't remember the recipe!

369
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:34,460
There you go.

370
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,200
I just gave you one.

371
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,080
I just gave you one, okay?

372
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:36,760
There you go.

373
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:37,220
No!

374
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:38,260
No, you did.

375
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:38,940
Oh, wait, you did.

376
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,860
I'm trying to make a fucking...

377
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:42,990
A stone pickaxe.

378
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,220
Why are you giving me a...

379
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:47,900
Oh, because I didn't have stone, because all I had was wood.

380
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,760
Come on, dig down, little baby.

381
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:50,620
I'm gonna make...

382
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:51,720
Why aren't you digging down?

383
00:13:53,500 --> 00:14:03,500
I'm gonna make a stone pickaxe, because I wanna win Minecraft, but somebody here is playing around.

384
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,000
Wait, how do you make a...

385
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:05,400
Oh, there it is.

386
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:05,580
Okay.

387
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:06,480
Oh, how do you make what?

388
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,620
A stone pickaxe?

389
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:08,980
Dig down.

390
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:09,680
Come on, keep digging.

391
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:10,700
I'm literally catching up.

392
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:11,840
I'm making a stone pickaxe.

393
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,060
I'm making a stone pickaxe right now.

394
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:15,400
I'm literally catching up to you.

395
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:19,040
Okay, I'm already further, way further down than you.

396
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:19,800
Oh, yeah?

397
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:20,600
Yeah.

398
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,920
I hope you drop right into lava.

399
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,140
I hear a zombie.

400
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,200
Oh, we're close, yeah.

401
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,380
I'm gonna go right into that first.

402
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:26,980
Oh, hey.

403
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:31,420
We literally had like a perfect run so far, and we're just ruining it.

404
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:36,200
By the way, I already got iron.

405
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,480
I'm done here.

406
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:39,520
Oh, you got iron?

407
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,540
Oh, me too.

408
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,340
Oh, I got a whole...

409
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,320
I got a whole bunch of it.

410
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:46,440
I'm already done with my job.

411
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,700
Alright, so furnace.

412
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:49,420
We need more iron.

413
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:50,480
Oh, not diamond.

414
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:51,960
How do I...

415
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,300
Oh, wait.

416
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,120
There's the...

417
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,160
We do need this though.

418
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,220
We need to eventually be able to craft.

419
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:58,000
Yeah, I'm making furnaces.

420
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:58,400
Oh, wait.

421
00:14:58,420 --> 00:14:58,920
We need coal.

422
00:14:59,060 --> 00:14:59,380
I forgot.

423
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,560
I forgot coal existed.

424
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:02,460
Yeah, idiot.

425
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:06,020
She doesn't know about logs, you guys.

426
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:06,640
Oh, my God.

427
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:07,920
Oh, my God.

428
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:08,680
Now, I do.

429
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,180
So now, I don't need to get coal.

430
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,280
Are you out?

431
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,060
Did you leave?

432
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,860
I have what I needed.

433
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:17,760
Why are you still doing that?

434
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:18,220
Why are you...

435
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:20,000
Why are you not digging down with me?

436
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,100
I thought we were gonna go find some...

437
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,180
I already got...

438
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:22,500
Oh, wait.

439
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,100
No, that's copper.

440
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,220
You said you wanna go find diamonds.

441
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,040
You didn't even get iron.

442
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:28,100
You got copper.

443
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:53,790
I guess we gotta reset the run.

444
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:56,490
Alright.

445
00:15:57,130 --> 00:15:58,550
Wait, do I need to leave first?

446
00:15:58,650 --> 00:15:59,650
No, I just...

447
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:00,250
I'm dying.

448
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:01,750
I'm resetting the server.

449
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:05,590
I forgot that you were...

450
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,750
You were down there.

451
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:09,110
Why would you forget?

452
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:11,490
Because I covered up the hole.

453
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:16,730
You tried to kill me.

454
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:18,830
And then, you literally fell into your own trap.

455
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:19,010
No, I didn't try to kill you.

456
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:20,890
I was trying to make stuff.

457
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:23,790
I was trying to make something.

458
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:28,190
So, I covered up your hole because I had to make something.

459
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:31,910
And I forgot you existed down there.

460
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:32,830
Can I go in now?

461
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:34,970
No, I need to restart the server.

462
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:36,050
Oh my god.

463
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:36,990
It's gonna take forever.

464
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:39,450
Okay, okay.

465
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:40,790
I'm okay now.

466
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:41,490
I'm okay.

467
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:44,690
That was a test run, guys.

468
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:46,250
Yeah, it was just a test run.

469
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,950
Even though we had a perfect setup, it would've been so good.

470
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:51,390
I had, like, the starts of iron.

471
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:52,390
I had...

472
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:54,930
We found a village that had everything we needed.

473
00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:58,710
It was just too good.

474
00:16:58,790 --> 00:16:59,630
It was just too easy.

475
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:00,310
I got...

476
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:03,610
I just wanted to make it a little bit more exciting.

477
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:04,850
Now, where are we?

478
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:06,230
Now, where are we?

479
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:07,150
Oh, I'm in a tree.

480
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:07,670
What the hell?

481
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:08,670
We're in a tree.

482
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:09,470
Where are you?

483
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:10,850
Oh, I see you.

484
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:11,610
There's sheep here.

485
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:12,730
Wait, where are you?

486
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:13,550
Kill him, kill him.

487
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:14,810
Alright, let's go.

488
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:16,270
I don't know if I fall.

489
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:17,290
I'm afraid of falling.

490
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:18,370
Just fucking fall.

491
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:19,710
I'm gonna...

492
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:20,770
No, I'm gonna jump into the water.

493
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:24,170
I'm gonna fucking beat up the tree real quick.

494
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:24,350
Oh my God, I'm a gamer.

495
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:25,490
Oh my God, you guys.

496
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:30,350
Oh my God, parkour civilization right here.

497
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:33,970
I jumped for the beef and I made it.

498
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:37,750
I'm gaming, I didn't lose a single heart.

499
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:39,510
Oh my God, me too.

500
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:41,270
I didn't lose a single heart either.

501
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:42,890
This is our first run, guys.

502
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:46,230
This is like the actual start of the run.

503
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:47,850
Yeah, yeah, this is where we started.

504
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:50,490
The last one, we were testing the server out.

505
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:51,090
Exactly.

506
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:52,590
She was lagging, you guys.

507
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:54,590
Yeah, I was lagging, I was lagging.

508
00:17:54,670 --> 00:18:00,410
I chose a server that's closer to Mint because I figured she needed more.

509
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:03,870
So because of that, I'm ticked, sadly, I have to...

510
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:04,370
She's closer to Mint.

511
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:06,870
It's an America server.

512
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:08,850
It's so far from Canada.

513
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:11,070
Oh my God, it's so far.

514
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:11,550
It's like an ocean.

515
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:12,370
They're not even connected.

516
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:16,930
Yeah, there's like an ocean that divides me from America.

517
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:18,850
That's how far she is from me.

518
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:21,130
What the hell?

519
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:23,430
There's a jungle over here.

520
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:24,490
Wait, where are you?

521
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:25,750
In the jungle.

522
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:27,890
The mighty jungle.

523
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:31,610
The lion sleeps tonight.

524
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:32,890
Do you know the lyrics?

525
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:34,450
Yeah, it's from Lion King.

526
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:35,170
What do you mean?

527
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:38,710
Why are you just following every time I say it?

528
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:40,450
Where are you?

529
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,210
Wait, Doki, can we get a parrot?

530
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,370
What are you gonna do with the parrot?

531
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:45,370
It's just gonna die.

532
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:46,270
No, it's not.

533
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:47,290
Not if we protect it.

534
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:48,310
Oh, there's a drown here.

535
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:50,130
Wait, is this like a monument thing?

536
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:51,530
Oh, it might be.

537
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:52,230
Be careful.

538
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:53,850
Wait, what is this?

539
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:55,270
Where are you?

540
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:57,210
It's like... There's like a thing here.

541
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:00,750
Oh, I see a pirate ship!

542
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:02,890
That's where we can get iron.

543
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:04,770
What's over here?

544
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:09,450
Oh, dig for treasure?

545
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:10,010
Okay.

546
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:12,530
Wait, you found a map?

547
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:14,690
No, the people were like, dig for treasure.

548
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:18,430
I don't think they know what they're talking about.

549
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:19,270
Oh, I see a drown.

550
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:21,170
I think he's gonna come and get me.

551
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:23,810
He said this for me... possible treasure.

552
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:27,850
Oh my God, wait, maybe I can get diamond before you.

553
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:30,010
Oh, I found a buried treasure map.

554
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:31,810
It might be where mine is.

555
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:33,550
Maybe, actually.

556
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:36,310
Am I gonna die?

557
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:37,590
I'm gonna die here.

558
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:39,370
I'm not gonna do this.

559
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:40,890
Wait, where even are you?

560
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:41,730
Where did you go?

561
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:44,170
I'm at a pirate ship.

562
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:44,850
I just said.

563
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:47,070
Where is the pirate ship?

564
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:48,470
Oh, ship.

565
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:48,970
Sorry.

566
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:50,670
Oh, wait, there you are.

567
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:51,850
Okay, you were just there.

568
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:53,530
I'm in the pirate ship.

569
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:55,030
The pirate trip.

570
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:56,930
Is there anything here?

571
00:19:57,770 --> 00:19:58,530
Not really.

572
00:19:59,150 --> 00:19:59,710
Did you get anything?

573
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:01,230
I got some carrots.

574
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:02,170
That's good.

575
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:03,010
We need food.

576
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:04,850
Oh, whoops.

577
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:05,890
I'm gonna die.

578
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:07,090
I'm dying.

579
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:08,410
You're fine.

580
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:09,450
Don't be a pussy.

581
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:10,930
I'm dying.

582
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:13,150
I literally lost a heart.

583
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:17,550
Oh my god, this is literally a chest filled with moss and rotten meat.

584
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:19,090
I know, it's terrible.

585
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:19,930
That is terrible.

586
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:22,430
Look at this bad pirate ship you found.

587
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:23,890
This pirate ship sucks.

588
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:24,710
I know, right?

589
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:27,490
Why did you choose this spawn, Doki?

590
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,150
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

591
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:31,490
Let me Google a seed for us.

592
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:38,450
Best hardcore Minecraft.

593
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:39,730
Is that what you want?

594
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:40,950
I think I'm actually gonna die.

595
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:44,290
Does the little baby want an actual... Wait, how many hearts do you have?

596
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:47,590
None of your business.

597
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:50,310
There's a drown literally next to us, by the way.

598
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:51,270
Yeah, I know.

599
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:51,890
I saw him.

600
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:53,850
You're fine.

601
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:55,630
See, he even had carrots.

602
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:56,790
Punch me.

603
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:57,390
See if I live.

604
00:20:58,630 --> 00:20:59,150
Oh, shit.

605
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:00,450
I'm gonna die again.

606
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:09,070
Wow, man.

607
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:11,310
How could you just die like that?

608
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:12,210
Wow.

609
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:14,510
I thought you were a gamer.

610
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:16,010
Oh, my gosh.

611
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,430
I can go down below now.

612
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:19,910
Now you can check.

613
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,850
Wait, there's bees here.

614
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:24,450
Wouldn't it be funny if there was a village right next to us?

615
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:25,150
Oh, my God.

616
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:26,010
Wait, I'm gonna see.

617
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:28,770
Wait, is there an actual village anywhere near us?

618
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:31,930
Um...

619
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:33,490
Not that I see.

620
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:35,610
Oh, so this was a bad spot anyway.

621
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:37,670
It was a bad spot.

622
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:38,450
You guys, we need a better seed than us.

623
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:40,590
That's why we died.

624
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:41,390
We were like, you know what?

625
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:42,530
This seed was pretty bad.

626
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:43,630
New seed.

627
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:44,370
New seed.

628
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:44,970
New seed.

629
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:45,450
New seed.

630
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:54,710
We just keep dying until we get some fucking village and those ender portals next to us.

631
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:56,550
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

632
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:58,130
Oh, my God.

633
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:01,490
Someone in my chat was just like, VOD gang, you can skip this stream.

634
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:06,770
On to the next stream, part two.

635
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:09,570
You just go to part two at that point.

636
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:13,090
Alright, restarting the server.

637
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:15,010
Restarting.

638
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:16,310
You know, I'm gonna put text here.

639
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:18,390
How many deaths?

640
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:20,890
Is that what you're putting?

641
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:23,050
Yeah.

642
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:27,210
You're putting how many deaths for each of us, right?

643
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:29,470
Like, Doki one death, Mint one death.

644
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:29,890
Yeah.

645
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:32,810
But my death was caused by you, so...

646
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:33,350
No, no.

647
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:34,970
I guess it was Doki two deaths, honestly.

648
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:38,970
Oh, my death was caused by you, so technically it's one-to-one then.

649
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:40,070
It's one-to-one.

650
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:42,850
It's one-to-one.

651
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:43,850
Alright, you can save the server.

652
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:49,770
It was one-to-one, technically, if you think about it, because my death was caused by you.

653
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:51,610
What are you talking about?

654
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:55,450
That is the ultimate cope I've ever heard of in my entire life.

655
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:56,450
Oh, yeah?

656
00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:59,610
Says the person that was like, hit me, see if I die.

657
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:02,770
Who said that?

658
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:03,890
Who said that?

659
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:06,350
I didn't think you'd actually do it.

660
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:09,930
What do you mean?

661
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:12,190
You said hit you, so I was like, alright, okay.

662
00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:14,450
Yeah, but like, you were really impressive.

663
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:16,110
If Mint says jump, I jump.

664
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:17,270
If Mint says...

665
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:25,470
If she tells me to jump off the cliff, I'll jump off the cliff.

666
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:28,550
If she tells me to hit her, I'll hit her until she dies.

667
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:33,770
Oh, another similar one.

668
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:36,550
Alright, got me by some logs.

669
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:38,690
Now I understand why it took them 20 days.

670
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:44,610
Wait, I see... I see a plains.

671
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:48,250
A savanna, that's a good place to find a village.

672
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:49,630
Oh, we can have a desert village.

673
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:51,190
Okay, I'm grabbing some wood again.

674
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:54,490
How many times will I have to grab wood for us?

675
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:55,990
For us?

676
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:57,270
Yeah, for us.

677
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:59,190
This is a team game.

678
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:03,530
I am playing Minecraft 2.

679
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:06,270
Okay, where are you?

680
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:07,910
Oh my god, there's a baby horse.

681
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:09,110
Wait, where are you?

682
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:09,670
Where did that sheep go?

683
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:11,610
Where is the savanna?

684
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:13,430
Over here.

685
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:14,710
Where's over here?

686
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:15,750
Use your eyes.

687
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:17,310
I am literally using my eyes.

688
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:19,050
I'm climbing up a fucking mountain right now.

689
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:20,170
Why are you climbing?

690
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:21,270
That's the opposite direction.

691
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:23,170
Oh, you could have said that.

692
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:24,750
You could have actually said that.

693
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:27,350
I have eyes, so I was able to see it.

694
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:30,030
Well, clearly we weren't spawning in the same... Oh, I see the savanna.

695
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:35,950
Oh, you know how I saw the savanna?

696
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:37,310
I climbed a mountain.

697
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:39,930
Yeah, but I didn't have to climb a mountain because I have better eyes than you.

698
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:42,850
Well, clearly you spawned in a better location where you could see the savanna.

699
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:46,910
Because I spawned on a tree where it was covered up by all the other trees.

700
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:49,510
I spawned in a tree too.

701
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:51,170
We have equal rights.

702
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:53,810
I don't think so.

703
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:54,470
I live in Canada.

704
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:07,190
In Minecraft, everyone is equal except the server mod.

705
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:18,050
Let me get some food for us.

706
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:19,410
Yeah, I'm killing sheep.

707
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:20,970
Me too.

708
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:22,450
I'm killing sheep and pigs.

709
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:25,850
I wish that was a taffy bar.

710
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:27,410
I'm about to kill a pig.

711
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:27,830
Oh, there he goes.

712
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:28,530
I see you.

713
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:29,910
I see you.

714
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:33,970
Let's get a yoink your crafting table.

715
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:35,130
No, you won't.

716
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:41,390
Okay, usually there's villages in this area.

717
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:43,950
Okay, I'm killing the sheep now.

718
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:46,970
I mean, what good does this mean if we can't cook it?

719
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:50,710
We can literally burn trees for that.

720
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:51,710
That's the whole point.

721
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:58,350
MrBeast is now controversial, so we have to burn all the trees that he planted.

722
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:02,450
Take back what once he planted.

723
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:04,890
Take it all back.

724
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:12,070
Take it all back.

725
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:13,030
Take it all back.

726
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:16,210
Oh, I see another portal, actually.

727
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:18,570
Oh shit, you see another portal?

728
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:21,370
Yeah, I'm really good at seeing things.

729
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:25,170
I'm pretty sure you just have better... Oh, there's chickens!

730
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:27,250
I literally even told you my FOB...

731
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:28,830
There's so many chickens!

732
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:31,990
She asked for my FOB, guys, and I was like...

733
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:33,810
Yeah, you guys wanna know what her FOB was?

734
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:34,450
You guys wanna know?

735
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:37,850
It was at 75, and that's default.

736
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:39,110
Is it default?

737
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:40,430
Yeah, that's default.

738
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:42,810
Well, that's good.

739
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:43,230
What is yours then?

740
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:43,970
No, it's not!

741
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:44,850
I'm on 85.

742
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:49,550
I was like wondering... I was wondering if I should do it higher or not.

743
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:54,110
My chat was like, damn, lol, your FOB.

744
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:55,030
Does mine look bad?

745
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:57,510
Guys, what does your chat say about your FOB?

746
00:26:58,270 --> 00:26:59,510
Oh, is it bad?

747
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:00,370
90 minimum?

748
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:01,950
I think I used to have it at that.

749
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:04,690
I think you just forgot to change it.

750
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:06,630
I think I forgot to change it when I...

751
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:07,910
Yeah, when you re-bought Minecraft.

752
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:10,170
Oh, I found an armadillo!

753
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:11,470
Wait, is this copper?

754
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:12,470
Yeah, that's copper.

755
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:13,950
Why didn't you say anything?

756
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:16,430
That's my chat's fault for not saying that.

757
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:19,130
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's your chat's fault.

758
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:21,430
Oh, you're gonna blame your chat?

759
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:22,650
Yeah.

760
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:23,710
That's fucked.

761
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:24,090
Of course I would.

762
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:24,850
That's fucked.

763
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:27,090
I would never drag loons.

764
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:28,230
I would never blame you guys.

765
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:30,470
Uh-oh, there might not be a village here.

766
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:33,910
Okay, I'm making... Oh, wait, this is not it.

767
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:35,430
I'm gonna make some sticks.

768
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:38,850
I'm making progress.

769
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:40,830
You're making sticks and I'm making progress.

770
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:41,410
Come on, Doki.

771
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:42,170
Oh, yeah, what are you doing?

772
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:42,710
What are you doing?

773
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:43,290
What are you doing?

774
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:43,990
Tell me, please.

775
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:43,990
I'm searching.

776
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:44,810
I found a village.

777
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:46,550
I literally just found a village!

778
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:47,090
Oh, please.

779
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:48,810
Enlighten me.

780
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:50,450
I'm stuck in a cave.

781
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:51,830
Oh, really?

782
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:53,470
I thought you found a village.

783
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:54,350
That doesn't sound...

784
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:54,390
I did.

785
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:55,510
Okay, I'm good now.

786
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:57,350
Alright.

787
00:27:58,490 --> 00:27:59,190
Look at that.

788
00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:00,310
I made an advancement.

789
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:02,310
Have you made an advancement?

790
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:03,510
Okay, caveman.

791
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:05,550
You're literally the one in the cave.

792
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:08,230
I have a bed now.

793
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:09,110
What do you have?

794
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:10,890
What are beds for?

795
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:12,950
Like, you can't respond.

796
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:13,930
It's the day.

797
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:14,970
It's literally the day.

798
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:16,270
We can sleep through the night.

799
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:21,510
I accidentally... I lost my stuff because I forgot...

800
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:26,210
Like, if you mine copper and iron with a wooden pickaxe, you don't get anything.

801
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:30,290
Are you bragging?

802
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:31,350
I don't know what you did.

803
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:37,670
No, I'm blaming you for my shortcomings.

804
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:44,730
Okay, now I can craft.

805
00:28:45,610 --> 00:28:47,350
Now I got copper.

806
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:49,610
Why are all the doors open?

807
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:50,310
This is weird.

808
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:52,150
Maybe they can open their own doors.

809
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:53,890
No, they don't do that.

810
00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:54,790
Yes, they do.

811
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:58,590
They have their own free will.

812
00:28:58,810 --> 00:29:00,850
Are you trying to say the villagers don't have rights?

813
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:02,630
Yeah.

814
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:03,870
Wow.

815
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:08,830
I need better food.

816
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:09,770
Oh wait, I have an apple.

817
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:14,270
I like how you don't even tell me where the village is.

818
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:15,330
You just left.

819
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:16,990
Oh yeah, the hay bales.

820
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:17,770
Yeah, for food.

821
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:19,550
Yeah, you gotta make the bread.

822
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:21,450
I told you I made progress.

823
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:25,450
Yeah, but this is literally a team game.

824
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:28,170
We have to make progress to get there.

825
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:28,810
Is this a team game?

826
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:30,570
I can't tell anymore.

827
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:32,010
What do you mean?

828
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:34,830
We're trying to work together to get to the fucking...

829
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:35,590
Whoa, what's that?

830
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:37,850
Oh, I saw the armadillo you found earlier.

831
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:39,750
The worthless piece of shit.

832
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:41,650
What do you mean?

833
00:29:41,930 --> 00:29:42,870
What do you do with an armadillo?

834
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:44,210
What can you do with an armadillo?

835
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:46,710
You can make dog armor.

836
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:47,250
Yeah?

837
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:47,770
Yeah?

838
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:50,330
The dog is still gonna die if you take it out to...

839
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:51,770
No, he's not if he has the armor.

840
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:55,390
Oh wow, there's also a jungle over there.

841
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:58,910
Alright, let's see.

842
00:29:59,230 --> 00:29:59,510
I think it's a jungle.

843
00:29:59,810 --> 00:30:02,890
I passed your armadillo, but I still don't see you.

844
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:04,470
Just keep going.

845
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:05,970
It's pretty far actually.

846
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:07,870
Oh, I see the village.

847
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:08,650
I see it.

848
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:10,090
Oh, my food galore.

849
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:11,750
There's so many pigs.

850
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:16,870
There's so many of them.

851
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:19,630
Alright,

852
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:24,790
nice.

853
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:30,450
Well, this village is not great just because it doesn't have like a...

854
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:32,410
That's fine.

855
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:34,700
I'm just trying to get meat right now.

856
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:41,790
It doesn't have any stuff like the wood or the stonesmith people.

857
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:43,450
I'm just gonna grab some wood.

858
00:30:44,330 --> 00:30:45,750
Wait, why do I need stairs for?

859
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:48,210
I'm just gonna grab wood.

860
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:50,010
I'm gonna destroy this home.

861
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:53,290
Where are you?

862
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:55,210
I'm destroying this one man's house.

863
00:30:55,910 --> 00:30:57,470
He'll never be safe again.

864
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:01,490
I'm grabbing... I'm stealing their food supply.

865
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:03,410
This village is literally gonna die out.

866
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:04,170
Nice.

867
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:05,370
We deserve it.

868
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:07,930
Why would you build a village here?

869
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:10,210
Yeah, this is a terrible location.

870
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:10,770
You know what?

871
00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:11,570
If I had... Do I flint?

872
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:12,350
No, I don't.

873
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:13,570
That was my previous life.

874
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:13,750
Oh, I do.

875
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:13,970
I do.

876
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:15,930
I have flint and steel.

877
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:17,390
You know what to do.

878
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:23,610
For some reason, I feel like we've done this before.

879
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:26,770
Death to the village!

880
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:27,890
Death to the village!

881
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:29,150
Raid the village!

882
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:30,890
Raid it!

883
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:33,410
Oh shit!

884
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:34,250
I'm inside!

885
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:38,190
Oh my god.

886
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:39,530
You fucking... We're gonna die.

887
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:40,630
I'm actually gonna die.

888
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:41,670
You fucking whore.

889
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:42,710
I'm gonna die.

890
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:44,670
Oh my god.

891
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:45,530
I almost died too.

892
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:45,530
Wait.

893
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:46,830
Wait.

894
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:52,870
Oh my god.

895
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:55,670
I'm actually... I'm like one and a half hearts.

896
00:31:56,130 --> 00:31:56,350
Here.

897
00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:57,010
I'll give you some.

898
00:31:57,130 --> 00:31:57,250
Here.

899
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:57,590
Here's some.

900
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:58,630
I can't even get up.

901
00:31:58,710 --> 00:31:59,870
I can't even...

902
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:03,910
Use the pickaxe you made.

903
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:07,050
I can't even... I can't even get out.

904
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:07,890
Hold on.

905
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:08,270
Hold on.

906
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:08,690
Hold on.

907
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:10,230
Dig this part.

908
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:11,370
I just need you to dig...

909
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:12,670
There you go.

910
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:12,910
Okay.

911
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:13,270
Nice.

912
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:14,150
You know, you could just...

913
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:16,550
I don't have any tools.

914
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:17,730
I don't have any tools.

915
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:19,370
Oh my god.

916
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:20,250
Alright.

917
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:21,570
Let me fucking...

918
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:25,330
Let me grab some trees and build a furnace real quick.

919
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:27,350
Let me...

920
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:28,150
You can just sleep.

921
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:29,010
It's fine.

922
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:30,550
What do you mean?

923
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:31,590
I can just sleep.

924
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:35,090
Sleeping doesn't do anything regarding health.

925
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:37,110
It doesn't... Oh.

926
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:38,450
I thought I gave you food.

927
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:38,810
Hold on.

928
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:39,170
Come here.

929
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:39,890
Okay.

930
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:40,070
Wait.

931
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:40,710
Do you have bread?

932
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:42,890
You can make your own bread.

933
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:43,890
Oh, wow.

934
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:44,490
Wow.

935
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:46,070
How fortunate of me.

936
00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:48,090
I gave you half of what I have.

937
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:53,730
How fortunate that I was given the privilege to make my own bread.

938
00:32:54,170 --> 00:32:54,830
Time to go to sleep.

939
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:58,450
Sleep, ducky, so we don't die.

940
00:32:59,190 --> 00:32:59,490
Alright.

941
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:00,130
Okay.

942
00:33:00,290 --> 00:33:00,930
I'm sleeping.

943
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:02,650
Yeah.

944
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:05,010
I'm sleeping now.

945
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:06,290
Alright.

946
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:06,810
Nice.

947
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:08,010
Nice.

948
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:08,790
Alright.

949
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:10,530
Let me make my bread.

950
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:12,290
Good morning, Minto.

951
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:13,470
Okay.

952
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:14,430
There you go.

953
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:16,150
I got 64 bread.

954
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:16,850
Let's go.

955
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:17,470
Wow.

956
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:17,990
See?

957
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:19,150
It's still burning.

958
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:20,870
How do you make the bread?

959
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:22,790
Wait.

960
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:23,510
There's more hay here.

961
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:25,010
You didn't finish farming all of this.

962
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:25,650
Oh.

963
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:26,290
Whoops.

964
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:29,170
Oh, it's my bread now.

965
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:29,770
Yeah.

966
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:30,550
It's your bread now.

967
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:33,370
Alright.

968
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:33,710
Nice.

969
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:34,050
Okay.

970
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:34,550
Okay.

971
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:35,150
We can't die.

972
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:36,390
This is actually a good run.

973
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:37,210
We can't die now.

974
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:38,790
Is this a good run?

975
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:39,890
Yeah.

976
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:43,990
We have all the bread in the world.

977
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:45,070
We can't die now.

978
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:48,110
Food was like the one thing I was most afraid of.

979
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:54,630
So now that we have all the food in the world, we should be good now.

980
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:56,590
Okay.

981
00:33:57,710 --> 00:33:57,930
Alright.

982
00:33:57,990 --> 00:33:58,410
I'm ready.

983
00:33:58,550 --> 00:33:59,690
I'm ready to find a cave.

984
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:02,270
I have so much food.

985
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:03,050
Dig down.

986
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:03,230
Alright.

987
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:03,490
Fine.

988
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:04,050
I'll dig down.

989
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:04,950
Yeah.

990
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:05,510
Where are you?

991
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:06,610
We're gonna dig down together.

992
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:07,710
We are?

993
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:08,230
Yeah.

994
00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:08,770
What do you mean?

995
00:34:08,890 --> 00:34:11,430
You said you were going to go explore and I am the bread maker.

996
00:34:11,430 --> 00:34:12,990
When did I say explore?

997
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:16,570
When did I say those exact words?

998
00:34:16,810 --> 00:34:20,930
I am the one who does everything above ground and you do everything below ground.

999
00:34:21,390 --> 00:34:21,690
Oh.

1000
00:34:22,390 --> 00:34:25,990
You know it'd be faster if we both did stuff together, right?

1001
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:28,930
You know that would be faster, right?

1002
00:34:28,970 --> 00:34:31,870
We could protect each other from dying.

1003
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:34,450
Alright.

1004
00:34:34,650 --> 00:34:34,690
Here.

1005
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:35,370
Let's sit down.

1006
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:36,110
Wait.

1007
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:36,650
Where are you?

1008
00:34:36,930 --> 00:34:38,170
I'm right behind you.

1009
00:34:38,170 --> 00:34:38,550
Oh.

1010
00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:38,890
Hello.

1011
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:40,810
I need stone.

1012
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:42,050
Let me get some stone.

1013
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:42,670
Let me...

1014
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:43,450
Alright.

1015
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:45,970
While you do that, I'm gonna get some cough drops real quick.

1016
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:46,610
I'll be right back.

1017
00:34:46,970 --> 00:34:47,570
Are you good?

1018
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:51,210
She's coughing, guys.

1019
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:52,570
She's coughing baby.

1020
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:55,810
She's like a freaking coughing baby.

1021
00:34:56,290 --> 00:34:57,090
Don't steal this.

1022
00:34:57,650 --> 00:35:00,490
What the fuck?

1023
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:03,570
She can't believe she stole that from me.

1024
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:07,250
She's literally AFK and she's still stealing from me.

1025
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:09,250
This is messed up.

1026
00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:13,970
How is it possible?

1027
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:15,410
What were you doing?

1028
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:18,070
Why were you saying it was messed up?

1029
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:19,410
I'm stealing.

1030
00:35:19,610 --> 00:35:21,510
I'm stealing the stone from the people.

1031
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:22,150
First time?

1032
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:23,690
No.

1033
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:26,030
It's still messed up though.

1034
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:28,350
You literally burned somebody's house down.

1035
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:29,830
And this is your lie.

1036
00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:30,650
This is your lie?

1037
00:35:30,770 --> 00:35:33,010
You burned someone's house down and this is your lie?

1038
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:35,230
Yeah.

1039
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:44,030
You cared about, like, somebody's stone.

1040
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:47,510
Rather than a villager burning to death.

1041
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:48,470
I'm having a change of heart.

1042
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:50,090
I'm literally having like a...

1043
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:50,390
You're changing?

1044
00:35:51,830 --> 00:35:55,610
What's that movie where that guy goes through the Christmas ghosts?

1045
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:57,550
Oh my gosh.

1046
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:58,350
A Christmas story?

1047
00:35:58,690 --> 00:35:59,590
A Christmas story.

1048
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:01,270
Yeah, it's happening to me.

1049
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:04,250
Yeah, but these are Scrooge and, like, the villagers are Little Timmy.

1050
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:09,330
Yeah, the ghosts of Christmas past, present, future are all coming to me.

1051
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:10,430
Oh my god.

1052
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:11,630
You're stealing the stone.

1053
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:15,610
And Little Timmy is not gonna make it for Christmas.

1054
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:17,950
Oh, it's a Christmas carol.

1055
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:22,030
You didn't correct me on... Yeah, it's sad.

1056
00:36:22,730 --> 00:36:26,990
Which is... Well, there's... Okay, well, Christmas people need to be more original then.

1057
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:30,430
Oh, but... Christmas, so, like, are we wrong?

1058
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:31,490
Yeah, it's basically the same.

1059
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:33,130
Yeah, it's literally the same thing.

1060
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:35,870
Can I make anything out of the mossy tree?

1061
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:37,610
A Christmas story is the one with the leg lamp?

1062
00:36:37,690 --> 00:36:39,030
What the fuck is... What?

1063
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:39,870
The what?

1064
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:42,170
Someone was like, that's the leg lamp.

1065
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:43,750
I'm like, what the fuck does that mean?

1066
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:44,990
A leg lamp?

1067
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:46,010
Leg.

1068
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:47,370
They said leg.

1069
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:49,930
Leg... Leg mod?

1070
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:56,750
Someone was like, why don't you have a mini map mod?

1071
00:36:56,830 --> 00:36:59,070
I was like, I'm not making this game easy.

1072
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:01,330
No, what are you talking about?

1073
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:01,970
We're gaming.

1074
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:02,890
Yeah, we're gaming.

1075
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:04,050
Alright, I'm ready.

1076
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:04,810
Are you ready now?

1077
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:07,090
Uh, yeah, probably.

1078
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:07,890
Alright, let's go.

1079
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:14,830
I'm gonna actually cut the... Get more wood just in case something happens to us.

1080
00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:16,730
I wanna go see the jungle.

1081
00:37:17,650 --> 00:37:19,310
That's not part of the plan, Mint.

1082
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:22,150
The jungle has nothing to do with the Ender Dragon.

1083
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:23,190
What if there's pandas?

1084
00:37:23,210 --> 00:37:26,550
The jungle has nothing to do with the dig.

1085
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:27,530
It's time to dig.

1086
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:28,870
You know your place.

1087
00:37:31,010 --> 00:37:31,630
Alright, we dig.

1088
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:33,110
Okay, we're digging for real though, right?

1089
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:34,650
Yeah, yeah, for real this time.

1090
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:35,730
No more...

1091
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:39,630
I think we have to find a way to... We have to dig in like a ladder.

1092
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:40,710
No, we don't.

1093
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:41,590
Or like a staircase.

1094
00:37:41,850 --> 00:37:41,950
No, we don't.

1095
00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:43,190
We have to come back out.

1096
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:46,550
We can just... We need... We're not gonna go back to the same area.

1097
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:48,610
We get our stuff and then fucking dig up.

1098
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:51,790
Oh, typical Mint.

1099
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:54,390
Letting me do all the work.

1100
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:55,850
Hold on, I don't have a shovel.

1101
00:37:56,330 --> 00:37:57,290
We don't need a shovel.

1102
00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:58,210
No, we don't.

1103
00:37:58,370 --> 00:37:59,030
Just jump down.

1104
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:02,390
You have a compass.

1105
00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:03,750
You dig mine and I'll dig yours.

1106
00:38:04,130 --> 00:38:04,470
Alright.

1107
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:08,490
We're so efficient.

1108
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:10,690
We're so efficient.

1109
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:12,610
This is teamwork.

1110
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:14,050
This is real teamwork, guys.

1111
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:17,810
I feel like digging our own hole is a lot faster than what we're doing.

1112
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:18,430
Oh, hold on.

1113
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:19,310
Mine just broke.

1114
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:19,910
Oh my God.

1115
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:21,750
Here, let me make here...

1116
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:23,570
Here, put your crafting table here.

1117
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:24,370
Okay, thank you.

1118
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:27,690
Wow, it feels like...

1119
00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:28,830
Oh, hey, coal.

1120
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:29,250
Nice.

1121
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:29,610
Okay.

1122
00:38:29,830 --> 00:38:30,330
We got coal.

1123
00:38:30,330 --> 00:38:31,030
Nice, nice.

1124
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:31,290
We got coal.

1125
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:32,670
Okay, we got coal now.

1126
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:35,330
Oh my God, this is a lot of coal.

1127
00:38:36,610 --> 00:38:37,530
Nice, you have a...

1128
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:39,530
Oh, hey, what about digging my hole?

1129
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:43,290
I'm sorry, coal is just much more important.

1130
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:46,070
I'm still digging coal out right now.

1131
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:47,190
Okay, I'm digging coal.

1132
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:47,970
I'm digging coal.

1133
00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:49,810
We're digging coal.

1134
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:50,690
We're digging coal.

1135
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:51,610
We're making progress.

1136
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:51,950
Alright.

1137
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:52,890
Great job.

1138
00:38:53,610 --> 00:38:53,910
Alright.

1139
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:55,710
Oh, wait, we're synced.

1140
00:38:55,810 --> 00:38:56,570
Oh, never mind.

1141
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:57,450
We're synced almost.

1142
00:38:58,210 --> 00:38:59,870
We're almost synced.

1143
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:03,690
Why is yours a little faster than mine?

1144
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:05,310
I don't know.

1145
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:06,870
Maybe I'm just more efficient than you.

1146
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:09,290
It's because I'm like...

1147
00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:09,490
Oh.

1148
00:39:09,490 --> 00:39:11,150
It's because I'm clicking you.

1149
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:12,750
I'm clicking you instead of holding.

1150
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:14,950
Yeah, I'm still...

1151
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:16,810
Oh, there we go.

1152
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:17,550
Yeah.

1153
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:18,470
Come on, come on.

1154
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:19,110
Dig me.

1155
00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:21,690
Oh, that's what it's called.

1156
00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:22,330
That's copy.

1157
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:23,410
Yeah.

1158
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:24,310
Alright.

1159
00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:27,870
Hey, don't hop.

1160
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:31,810
Oh yeah, what's going on?

1161
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:33,270
Oh, we're synced up again.

1162
00:39:33,290 --> 00:39:34,150
Where's our cave?

1163
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:34,830
Where's our cave?

1164
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:36,370
Where the fuck is our cave?

1165
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:39,910
There has to be at least one cave.

1166
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:40,230
I hear a zombie.

1167
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:41,750
Oh.

1168
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:43,510
We could get the diamonds.

1169
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:44,250
Oh.

1170
00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:46,950
Wait, I think we might be close to that.

1171
00:39:46,990 --> 00:39:48,190
Oh, I hear a zombie to our left.

1172
00:39:48,330 --> 00:39:49,130
I hear a zombie, yeah.

1173
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:50,390
Yeah, maybe we should dig left.

1174
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:51,390
Our left?

1175
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:52,310
Wait, that's our right?

1176
00:39:52,610 --> 00:39:53,150
Are your earbuds on there?

1177
00:39:53,510 --> 00:39:54,570
There you go, there you go, there you go.

1178
00:39:54,570 --> 00:39:56,310
No, I think your earbuds is wrong.

1179
00:39:56,570 --> 00:39:57,230
This is left.

1180
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:00,990
Kill him!

1181
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:02,050
Kill him!

1182
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:03,030
Where is he?

1183
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:04,210
Oh my God, I can't even tell.

1184
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:05,530
Oh my God, I might die, I might die.

1185
00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:06,630
You gotta kill him, I might die.

1186
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:07,810
I actually might die, I actually might die.

1187
00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:08,510
You have to kill him.

1188
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:09,210
You have to!

1189
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:21,680
I'm bleeding you.

1190
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:23,620
What do you mean you bled me?

1191
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,480
You did not did it!

1192
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,940
I was literally fighting him.

1193
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,020
You were in front of me.

1194
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:31,040
What do you mean I was fighting him?

1195
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:33,560
If I had attacked him, I would have killed you.

1196
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:34,660
You hesitated.

1197
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:35,400
No, I didn't.

1198
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:37,040
You literally had to kill me.

1199
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:40,200
If I had attacked him, I would have attacked you and you would have died faster.

1200
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:46,280
You literally had a chance to fucking hit.

1201
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:47,340
I saw you hesitate.

1202
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:49,180
I saw you look at him.

1203
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,160
I was attacking!

1204
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,900
You looked at him before you attacked him.

1205
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:55,500
That was your fault.

1206
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:56,340
That was your...

1207
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:57,480
I'm blaming that on you.

1208
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:00,120
That's a mid-death number three right there.

1209
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:05,140
Wait, are you saying mid-death number three?

1210
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,660
Why am I at three?

1211
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:09,960
You know why.

1212
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:10,360
You...

1213
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:11,700
Doki 2.

1214
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:15,860
What do you mean Doki 2?

1215
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:17,900
Doki is coping.

1216
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,540
What do you mean Doki 2?

1217
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:20,440
You literally...

1218
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,960
You literally...

1219
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,100
I've never explored...

1220
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:25,140
Okay, you go first then.

1221
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:27,200
When we're at a cave, you go first.

1222
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:28,820
I...

1223
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:29,360
What are you talking about?

1224
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,060
You go first.

1225
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:33,520
I literally went first and then I attracted the baby zombie.

1226
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:36,360
We didn't even have any iron for a shield.

1227
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:37,160
I went first.

1228
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:38,060
It's all on you.

1229
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:39,680
It's all on you.

1230
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:40,900
How is that on me?

1231
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,720
I went first and I was like...

1232
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:45,180
Alright, there's the cave.

1233
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:46,420
I could hear it because I was like...

1234
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:46,980
Oh, turn left.

1235
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:48,320
There's a cave on the left side.

1236
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:49,220
And then I turned...

1237
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:50,720
I dug the cave hole for us.

1238
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,900
And then I went to explore first.

1239
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,860
I went to brave the wild for you.

1240
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,120
All I hear is...

1241
00:41:59,340 --> 00:41:59,780
Okay.

1242
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:04,020
Anyway, you log in now.

1243
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:04,860
Okay.

1244
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,140
This is good.

1245
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,920
This is a good biome.

1246
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,920
Alright, time to hit the trees again.

1247
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:15,020
Hit the trees.

1248
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,080
Hitting the trees.

1249
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:17,940
Hit the trees.

1250
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:18,740
Hit the trees.

1251
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:20,460
Hitting the trees.

1252
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:23,080
Hitting the trees.

1253
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:26,880
Alright, what if we get a shield before we dig down?

1254
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:27,600
Okay, yeah.

1255
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:29,260
That sounds like a better idea.

1256
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:31,140
Why didn't you come up with the idea earlier?

1257
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:32,500
I...

1258
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:35,320
You know, my genius hits me in funny ways.

1259
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:36,940
Did chat tell you that?

1260
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:38,200
No.

1261
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:41,960
I knew that because I watched the video on how to prepare for...

1262
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:42,800
How to prepare for Minecraft hardcore.

1263
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:43,980
Oh, so you cheated.

1264
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:47,440
So you cheated before the stream.

1265
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:48,680
How is research cheating?

1266
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:50,260
So you researched...

1267
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:50,660
Oh, no.

1268
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:51,660
It is cheating.

1269
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:52,160
It is.

1270
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:57,080
You're trying to find the most optimal route instead of, you know, letting it happen.

1271
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:58,740
No, did I still have to do it all on my own?

1272
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:00,820
It's still my own skill work.

1273
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:02,020
Yeah, Ms...

1274
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:03,140
Let's go to the jungle.

1275
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:06,860
Yeah, the jungle probably wouldn't have killed us.

1276
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:08,840
Yeah, did the video tell you to go to the jungle?

1277
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:11,360
Did it tell you to go to the jungle with the most optimal route?

1278
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:15,020
The jungle probably has really great secrets.

1279
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:15,640
Like what?

1280
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:16,680
Like what?

1281
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:16,820
I don't know.

1282
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:17,460
That's why we...

1283
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:18,580
I don't know their secrets.

1284
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:19,440
We could've gone to...

1285
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:20,800
You don't fucking know the secrets.

1286
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:21,860
You watched the video.

1287
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,400
The video was not gonna tell us everything.

1288
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,520
The video does not hold your hand.

1289
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:28,520
Then what the point was the video for?

1290
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:29,780
It's a video guide.

1291
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:30,960
Where are...

1292
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:31,360
Oh, there you are.

1293
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:31,960
Come over here.

1294
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:32,480
I see you.

1295
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:33,840
Oh, there's a fucking cow.

1296
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:35,100
This is the first time I saw a cow.

1297
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:37,220
Fucking...

1298
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:38,260
Eat up this cow.

1299
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:40,160
In my hands.

1300
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:43,680
I'm so tired of chopping trees.

1301
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:45,000
I'm so...

1302
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:45,520
It's Minecraft.

1303
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:47,160
It's literally Minecraft.

1304
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:48,240
Just get used to it.

1305
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:48,520
I'm so...

1306
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:51,000
I'm so tired of punching trees.

1307
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:51,740
This is literally what you do in Minecraft.

1308
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:53,200
I'm so...

1309
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,500
I'm so over this...

1310
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:55,760
These fucking trees.

1311
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:57,400
This wasn't your idea.

1312
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:01,860
This wasn't your idea.

1313
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:05,640
So it's been 44 minutes, but Min's volume okay so far.

1314
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:12,060
Okay, I just didn't think that Min would cause me to die so many times.

1315
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:14,080
Guys, can you believe this?

1316
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:18,580
This coping is absolutely ridiculous.

1317
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:21,580
I think the fall really did her in.

1318
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:22,780
She's just...

1319
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:24,600
Oh, I just killed this sheep's...

1320
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:27,500
Killed this sheep's mom right in front of him.

1321
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:29,180
Oh my god.

1322
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:30,140
Alright.

1323
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:33,240
Little baby sheep just ran up to his dead mom.

1324
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:34,120
It's so sad.

1325
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:34,560
Oh my god.

1326
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:36,440
It's like a Disney movie right there.

1327
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:37,080
I know.

1328
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:38,420
I just caused...

1329
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:39,100
I just made the Lion King.

1330
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:39,880
You just caused Bambi.

1331
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:40,700
You're welcome, everybody.

1332
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:41,840
Oh, the Lion King?

1333
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:44,200
Yeah, because it's a better movie.

1334
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:45,380
No, it's a better movie.

1335
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,180
Are you trying to say Bambi is not a good movie?

1336
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:48,660
I'm just saying...

1337
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:51,700
Can we agree that the Lion King is a better movie than Bambi?

1338
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:55,920
I guess if you're a furry.

1339
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:03,680
Yeah, I'm in.

1340
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:07,760
That's your opinion.

1341
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,640
That's your opinion.

1342
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:13,380
That's a certified Doki Bird opinion.

1343
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:18,240
I wonder if there's any villages.

1344
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:23,060
I'm searching.

1345
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:25,440
I'm getting...

1346
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,260
Alright, there has to be another village, right?

1347
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:30,120
Usually, this biome is good.

1348
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:31,680
Yeah.

1349
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:33,860
Oh my gosh, you know about all that, too?

1350
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:37,480
Wow, she's a game.

1351
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:39,320
Yeah, she played a lot.

1352
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:42,780
Alright.

1353
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:44,360
I'm digging.

1354
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:47,220
I'm punching more trees.

1355
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:49,400
I'm punching so many trees.

1356
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:52,940
Alright, I'm gonna look for a village, too.

1357
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:56,220
I'm running out of...

1358
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:58,200
We need to get food soon, too.

1359
00:45:58,200 --> 00:45:59,220
I know.

1360
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:00,380
Well, I have...

1361
00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:01,440
I have...

1362
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:02,940
Some raw meat.

1363
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:04,040
Yeah, I do, too.

1364
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:06,700
But I think I'd rather just find a village and, like...

1365
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:08,020
Get, uh...

1366
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:08,980
Steal their food and pillage them.

1367
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:10,680
Yeah, just steal the food and pillage them.

1368
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:11,080
It's just...

1369
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:14,140
Why do our own work when we can rob others of their work?

1370
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:14,700
I know!

1371
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:16,600
They already did the hard part.

1372
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:17,380
Yeah, exactly!

1373
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:19,040
That's what pillaging is for.

1374
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:19,940
Yeah.

1375
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:21,440
Yeah, I mean, look at the Vikings.

1376
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:24,400
Oh, there's some coal here.

1377
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:26,780
I mean, the Vikings knew what's up.

1378
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:27,980
We just...

1379
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:30,120
Let's just ignore all the other bad stuff they've done.

1380
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:32,140
But, like, other than that, they thrived.

1381
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:33,900
They had the right idea.

1382
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:35,440
They had the right idea.

1383
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:36,680
Yeah, exactly.

1384
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:39,280
Oh, I'm advancing.

1385
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:41,900
Are you sure there's...

1386
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:44,220
I'm fucking trying to find a village.

1387
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:47,760
So am I, and I found other things along the way.

1388
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:49,060
And you dug a fucking rock.

1389
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:49,920
Congratulations.

1390
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:55,860
I got coal for us so we could cook our meal.

1391
00:46:55,860 --> 00:46:57,380
I mean, we have trees.

1392
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:03,100
Trees do the same thing with less resources.

1393
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:05,400
No, it's actually more resources.

1394
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:08,480
With less effort getting the resources.

1395
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:10,840
We're at the end of the...

1396
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:12,280
There's a really big cave here.

1397
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:12,820
Oh, shoot!

1398
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:14,180
It's okay, you'll be fine.

1399
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:17,540
I am trying to find a village.

1400
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:18,540
I don't think I'm gonna be fine.

1401
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:19,040
Oh, shit.

1402
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:22,040
Okay, Mint, just die now so we can restart this.

1403
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:26,020
All I wanted was the coal.

1404
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:31,860
I will know she lives here now while I try to find a village.

1405
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:35,800
I think I'm good.

1406
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:36,760
Okay, good.

1407
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:38,360
I'm far, far.

1408
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:40,380
What is far, far?

1409
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:42,040
I kept going forward.

1410
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:44,260
You went into the cave, I went forward.

1411
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:46,500
Wait, did you see me go into the cave?

1412
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:47,300
No.

1413
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:50,880
Then how do you know where I am?

1414
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:53,400
Because I saw you and then you disappeared.

1415
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:58,600
I assumed something happened to you.

1416
00:47:58,620 --> 00:47:59,720
I'm almost out of food.

1417
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:01,220
Or out of... wait.

1418
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:03,400
Okay, I'm gonna have to eat the raw beef.

1419
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:04,480
Eat it.

1420
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:06,200
Just cook the raw beef.

1421
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:07,240
You have the coal.

1422
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:08,880
You have rock.

1423
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:10,600
Where is the...

1424
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:11,300
Oh, you're right.

1425
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:12,300
What do you mean?

1426
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:15,440
You literally advanced to the stone age.

1427
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:17,040
What do you mean?

1428
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:19,020
Is this terracotta?

1429
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:21,360
I think I'm the luckiest gamer ever.

1430
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:23,140
Wait, why are we at terracotta?

1431
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:24,200
Where?

1432
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:25,040
It's terracotta.

1433
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:25,760
Wait, no.

1434
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:26,960
What is this yellow sand?

1435
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:27,880
Red sand?

1436
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:30,060
Yeah, it's terracotta sand.

1437
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:30,480
Yeah.

1438
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:33,660
Why is there fucking terracotta?

1439
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:37,200
I don't know.

1440
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:38,740
Or mesa.

1441
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:40,360
Oh, the mesa biome.

1442
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:44,420
Not ideal.

1443
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:47,760
Not ideal, because I'm here for the fucking village.

1444
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,080
Bad spawn.

1445
00:48:49,580 --> 00:48:50,120
Bad seed.

1446
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:50,940
Hate this seed.

1447
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:57,680
If only somebody didn't fucking protect me from the zombie... the baby zombie.

1448
00:48:58,080 --> 00:48:59,740
Did you say didn't protect you?

1449
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:00,940
If only somebody...

1450
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:02,160
If only someone did not protect you.

1451
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:02,320
Oh yeah, sorry.

1452
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:04,840
I mean somebody did protect me from the baby...

1453
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:06,000
I'm already delusional.

1454
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:07,460
It's been like an hour already.

1455
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:08,940
I'm already... I'm already done.

1456
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:12,660
We haven't made... We've made zero progress.

1457
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:14,520
We haven't even...

1458
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:19,200
We can't get past to the... to the... to the cave section yet.

1459
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:24,900
Where is the village?

1460
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:28,220
I'm still... I'm still...

1461
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:29,020
Oh, it's okay.

1462
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:32,000
I found... I found like a corrupted nether portal.

1463
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:33,480
At least we got that.

1464
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:35,800
That's good.

1465
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:37,280
We're gonna die.

1466
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:39,700
The sun's gonna go down and we're gonna die for real.

1467
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:41,760
We mean we're gonna die.

1468
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:43,700
Oh, okay.

1469
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:45,860
Actually, I am gonna build my furnace.

1470
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:48,020
I'm gonna have real food.

1471
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:51,700
I don't... It's not even... The sun is still up still.

1472
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:53,060
Nevermind, I don't have enough stone.

1473
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:56,980
Okay, I found a... There's stone all around you!

1474
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:58,720
Where are you?

1475
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:00,100
How do you know there's stone all around me?

1476
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:01,680
I thought you said you dropped into a cave.

1477
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:04,260
No, I've... I've got out of there.

1478
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:05,620
I've been searching for a village.

1479
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:08,060
Oh my God, at least I got golden carrots.

1480
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:09,920
How the hell?

1481
00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:10,780
Oh, from the...

1482
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:12,700
The corrupted portal, yeah.

1483
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:13,600
Oh my God.

1484
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:17,000
Yeah, well, I got my food.

1485
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:19,100
I'm gonna create my house in here.

1486
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:19,840
Maybe.

1487
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:21,500
Okay, furnace.

1488
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:24,260
Furnace.

1489
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:26,420
Is that your new house?

1490
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:27,500
Is this where you're gonna live now?

1491
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:29,700
Yeah.

1492
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:31,460
Why do you act like you know where I am?

1493
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:32,480
It's freaking me out.

1494
00:50:32,820 --> 00:50:33,720
I mean, I can see you.

1495
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:34,960
Where?

1496
00:50:36,740 --> 00:50:38,500
Yeah, I can see you right now.

1497
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:40,080
Where?

1498
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:40,940
What am I doing?

1499
00:50:41,420 --> 00:50:42,780
You're freaking trying to make a furnace.

1500
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:45,120
No, I made the furnace.

1501
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:46,780
Give me a CV, you're full of shit.

1502
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,920
No, I saw you make that furnace.

1503
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:50,200
No, you didn't.

1504
00:50:50,220 --> 00:50:51,060
Yes, I did.

1505
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:53,280
Okay, what am I doing right now?

1506
00:50:53,580 --> 00:50:54,180
Right now?

1507
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:55,000
Yeah.

1508
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:56,720
You're just walking around.

1509
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:58,020
No, I'm not.

1510
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:01,500
You're so full of shit.

1511
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:03,540
You're so full of shit.

1512
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:05,980
You...

1513
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:07,760
You got paranoid for a second.

1514
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:08,840
You got paranoid.

1515
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:12,940
Yeah, but you are just a liar.

1516
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:16,020
You can't gaslight me for too long.

1517
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:16,920
I call you out.

1518
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:20,020
What are you doing then, huh?

1519
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:23,760
I'm making food and I'm preparing for the night.

1520
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:28,120
The sun is... Oh, it's going down.

1521
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:28,660
Oh, wait.

1522
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:30,960
Yeah, it's going really way down.

1523
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:32,640
It's going way down.

1524
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:35,520
Oh, this is a little bad.

1525
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:36,180
Yeah.

1526
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:39,040
What do you mean one of us, huh?

1527
00:51:39,060 --> 00:51:39,920
What are you doing?

1528
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:42,400
I'm digging.

1529
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:44,280
I'm making a little hole.

1530
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:46,780
What are you doing?

1531
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:48,680
I'm doing the same thing.

1532
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:50,060
Uh -huh.

1533
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:51,900
I doubt it for some reason.

1534
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:55,140
It's because I'm in the water now.

1535
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:57,140
I'm doing the same thing.

1536
00:51:57,460 --> 00:51:59,320
Are we just going to spend the night in the hole?

1537
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:00,580
Is that what we're...

1538
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:01,580
Is that what we're...

1539
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:02,580
I don't want to.

1540
00:52:02,860 --> 00:52:05,040
I think I can make a bed because I got some...

1541
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:05,440
Wait, let's see.

1542
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:07,440
Oh, I can make a bed.

1543
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:09,240
Wait, how many do you need for a bed?

1544
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:10,000
I forgot.

1545
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:12,680
Three wool.

1546
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:16,440
Okay, let's see if I can do this in time before the...

1547
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:17,620
Before they come in.

1548
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:21,060
I'm asleep.

1549
00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:22,260
I'm ready for bed.

1550
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:23,600
Okay, I'm asleep too.

1551
00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:24,380
Okay.

1552
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:28,560
Before the zombies get here, do it before the zombies come up.

1553
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:29,280
I'm asleep.

1554
00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:29,720
I'm asleep.

1555
00:52:29,820 --> 00:52:30,100
I'm asleep.

1556
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:30,920
Okay, thank God.

1557
00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:35,040
Alright, everything is fine, guys.

1558
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:36,060
Everything is fine, guys.

1559
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:37,380
Everything is fine.

1560
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:38,680
We know what we're doing.

1561
00:52:40,020 --> 00:52:40,420
Yeah.

1562
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:42,660
One of us knows what we're doing.

1563
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:44,560
Guess which one it is.

1564
00:52:46,060 --> 00:52:46,860
I made a bed first.

1565
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:47,440
I'm just saying.

1566
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:50,180
But your initial plan was to dig a fucking hole.

1567
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:52,400
You literally was like, I'm going to dig a hole.

1568
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:54,300
I made a hole in the mountain.

1569
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:55,640
In the side of the mountain.

1570
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:57,460
What are we going to do in the side of the mountain?

1571
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:58,820
What are we going to do there?

1572
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:00,120
What does it benefit?

1573
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:02,360
I'm finding coal.

1574
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:04,120
I already have coal.

1575
00:53:04,820 --> 00:53:05,340
How many?

1576
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:08,340
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

1577
00:53:08,340 --> 00:53:09,500
You have to count your coal.

1578
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:12,320
Because I'm in front of coal right

1579
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:17,800
now in the blocks in front of me.

1580
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:19,180
You can't just count what's in your inventory?

1581
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:20,760
Oh my God.

1582
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:23,260
I'm literally in front of coal right now.

1583
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:24,360
Okay.

1584
00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:27,540
I'm got to be in the stone age so I can farm this.

1585
00:53:32,030 --> 00:53:33,190
Oh yeah, watch this.

1586
00:53:33,410 --> 00:53:34,370
We should probably meet up.

1587
00:53:35,190 --> 00:53:35,630
Coal.

1588
00:53:36,670 --> 00:53:37,110
Woah.

1589
00:53:38,730 --> 00:53:39,170
Coal.

1590
00:53:39,330 --> 00:53:42,110
Look at all this coal in front of me.

1591
00:53:42,430 --> 00:53:42,870
Wow.

1592
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:45,870
Guys.

1593
00:53:46,490 --> 00:53:47,610
How do I get out of this?

1594
00:53:48,450 --> 00:53:51,630
Alright, first one to find the village has to tell the coordinates to the other person.

1595
00:53:52,170 --> 00:53:52,570
Okay.

1596
00:53:54,170 --> 00:53:55,670
I'm going to be lazy then.

1597
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:56,450
I'm not going to do anything.

1598
00:53:56,690 --> 00:53:58,290
Oh yeah, you're going to have to travel to me.

1599
00:54:03,570 --> 00:54:04,610
Yeah, okay.

1600
00:54:05,290 --> 00:54:06,390
Would you rather travel?

1601
00:54:08,270 --> 00:54:09,210
I could just...

1602
00:54:09,210 --> 00:54:11,030
If I find the village...

1603
00:54:11,030 --> 00:54:12,230
I might find it first.

1604
00:54:12,350 --> 00:54:15,710
If I find the village first, you have to fucking find me.

1605
00:54:15,770 --> 00:54:18,130
And I could just sit on my ass just waiting for you at the village.

1606
00:54:18,310 --> 00:54:20,630
No, you would have to gather everything at the village.

1607
00:54:21,470 --> 00:54:22,710
No, I don't have to.

1608
00:54:23,010 --> 00:54:23,490
No, I don't.

1609
00:54:23,870 --> 00:54:24,510
Why do I have to?

1610
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:26,210
This is a team effort.

1611
00:54:26,690 --> 00:54:28,010
Why did you find the village?

1612
00:54:29,090 --> 00:54:29,850
What do you mean?

1613
00:54:29,970 --> 00:54:32,390
Is it only my job to find villages?

1614
00:54:33,010 --> 00:54:34,110
Yes, it's a team.

1615
00:54:34,190 --> 00:54:34,850
Oh, what happened?

1616
00:54:34,990 --> 00:54:35,670
It's a team game.

1617
00:54:36,050 --> 00:54:37,650
We got to find the village together.

1618
00:54:38,090 --> 00:54:40,270
Oh, and now you want to find it together, huh?

1619
00:54:40,390 --> 00:54:41,030
Oh yeah.

1620
00:54:41,270 --> 00:54:43,890
No, I said the first person to find a village...

1621
00:54:43,890 --> 00:54:46,290
gets to make the other person travel all the way there.

1622
00:54:47,490 --> 00:54:47,850
Okay.

1623
00:54:49,150 --> 00:54:50,610
Oh my gosh, I found so much coal.

1624
00:54:50,930 --> 00:54:51,930
Me too, I found a lot of coal.

1625
00:54:52,030 --> 00:54:52,870
I've just been mining coal.

1626
00:54:53,230 --> 00:54:56,730
It would be a shame if one of us dies after all this hard coal I just mined.

1627
00:54:57,630 --> 00:54:58,990
We're gonna live, we're gonna live.

1628
00:54:59,070 --> 00:54:59,510
Right, everybody?

1629
00:54:59,990 --> 00:55:01,470
Oh shit, I almost died.

1630
00:55:07,890 --> 00:55:09,250
We're all gonna live, right?

1631
00:55:09,330 --> 00:55:10,190
We're all gonna live!

1632
00:55:10,230 --> 00:55:10,990
We're all gonna live!

1633
00:55:11,990 --> 00:55:13,890
We're all gonna live!

1634
00:55:15,010 --> 00:55:16,730
I think if we die...

1635
00:55:19,310 --> 00:55:19,770
Someone...

1636
00:55:19,770 --> 00:55:21,710
We have to have a chat sacrifice.

1637
00:55:22,750 --> 00:55:23,690
We ban one person?

1638
00:55:23,690 --> 00:55:25,410
We ban a person, yeah.

1639
00:55:27,590 --> 00:55:29,030
For every death.

1640
00:55:29,270 --> 00:55:30,450
You can't unban them though.

1641
00:55:31,330 --> 00:55:32,070
Oh, shoot.

1642
00:55:34,250 --> 00:55:35,390
Oh, I found some iron!

1643
00:55:38,510 --> 00:55:39,530
Oh my god, please.

1644
00:55:39,710 --> 00:55:41,770
Oh my god, where am I anymore?

1645
00:55:41,910 --> 00:55:44,030
I don't even know where I am anymore.

1646
00:55:44,590 --> 00:55:46,710
I don't even know where I am.

1647
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:48,510
Oh, I found iron, but it's in the water.

1648
00:55:49,150 --> 00:55:50,610
So that's too much effort.

1649
00:55:51,910 --> 00:55:52,750
Hey, come on.

1650
00:55:53,190 --> 00:55:54,750
Come on, you gotta put in the effort.

1651
00:55:55,350 --> 00:55:58,030
I'm gonna mine something that's not in the water.

1652
00:55:58,950 --> 00:55:59,630
Did I get it?

1653
00:56:00,030 --> 00:56:01,910
Oh my god, I'm walking backwards now.

1654
00:56:02,010 --> 00:56:04,510
I'm back to the mesa biome.

1655
00:56:04,530 --> 00:56:06,030
Where is the mesa biome anyway?

1656
00:56:06,150 --> 00:56:06,890
Oh my god, I'm gonna die.

1657
00:56:07,330 --> 00:56:08,850
Well, guess you'll never know.

1658
00:56:10,910 --> 00:56:14,590
Okay, I made it out with one single iron.

1659
00:56:14,890 --> 00:56:15,690
Oh, I found a village.

1660
00:56:16,410 --> 00:56:16,970
What, really?

1661
00:56:16,970 --> 00:56:19,050
I don't believe you.

1662
00:56:19,370 --> 00:56:20,590
No, I literally found a village.

1663
00:56:21,070 --> 00:56:22,150
I don't believe you.

1664
00:56:22,510 --> 00:56:24,270
I literally see it right...

1665
00:56:24,270 --> 00:56:25,150
Wait, is that a village?

1666
00:56:25,650 --> 00:56:26,450
Or is that a temple?

1667
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:27,990
Oh, it's a temple.

1668
00:56:28,590 --> 00:56:30,150
I found a temple, yeah.

1669
00:56:31,630 --> 00:56:32,850
Wait, is the temple better?

1670
00:56:34,110 --> 00:56:35,850
No, well, I mean...

1671
00:56:35,850 --> 00:56:36,870
You can get stuff in there.

1672
00:56:37,230 --> 00:56:38,650
Oh wait, there's like traps there.

1673
00:56:40,290 --> 00:56:40,730
Right?

1674
00:56:40,950 --> 00:56:42,310
Yeah, well, there's... Okay.

1675
00:56:43,450 --> 00:56:46,270
I wanna... I have to show you how to do it, or else you'll die.

1676
00:56:46,270 --> 00:56:47,650
Yeah, I think I'm gonna die.

1677
00:56:48,330 --> 00:56:49,750
Oh, you are gonna die?

1678
00:56:49,870 --> 00:56:50,010
Okay.

1679
00:56:50,010 --> 00:56:51,350
I think I'm gonna die from TNT.

1680
00:56:52,130 --> 00:56:54,450
Well, I guess, good luck trying to find this temple.

1681
00:56:55,330 --> 00:56:56,750
I don't even know where you are.

1682
00:56:56,930 --> 00:56:57,290
Exactly.

1683
00:56:58,730 --> 00:57:00,050
I think I'm far away from you.

1684
00:57:00,830 --> 00:57:02,330
I think you went a different direction than me.

1685
00:57:02,490 --> 00:57:03,190
I think so, too.

1686
00:57:03,230 --> 00:57:04,970
You never saw the Mesa biome.

1687
00:57:05,410 --> 00:57:05,690
No.

1688
00:57:06,230 --> 00:57:07,910
I'm still in the... What's it called, biome?

1689
00:57:08,370 --> 00:57:09,350
The what biome?

1690
00:57:09,470 --> 00:57:10,230
The sand?

1691
00:57:10,330 --> 00:57:10,650
The desert?

1692
00:57:12,090 --> 00:57:13,830
I never... Wait, there's a desert biome?

1693
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:15,330
Oh my god, I went too far.

1694
00:57:15,330 --> 00:57:17,270
It's not a temple, guys.

1695
00:57:17,690 --> 00:57:18,490
It's not a temple.

1696
00:57:19,930 --> 00:57:21,350
Wait, you never...

1697
00:57:21,350 --> 00:57:23,530
Okay, I definitely went too far.

1698
00:57:24,290 --> 00:57:25,370
Where did you go?

1699
00:57:25,490 --> 00:57:26,190
I don't know.

1700
00:57:26,530 --> 00:57:29,970
I went to a place where there's a desert biome, and I never left.

1701
00:57:32,270 --> 00:57:33,890
How do I get around this?

1702
00:57:34,290 --> 00:57:34,830
Okay.

1703
00:57:35,890 --> 00:57:37,650
We should have just died.

1704
00:57:38,110 --> 00:57:40,590
Our other seas were so much better.

1705
00:57:41,030 --> 00:57:41,610
We had...

1706
00:57:41,610 --> 00:57:44,450
We had actual villages, like, within seconds.

1707
00:57:45,270 --> 00:57:50,690
We had actual good seed, and then Mint fucked it up.

1708
00:57:50,870 --> 00:57:55,230
And then she fucked it up for the rest of...

1709
00:57:56,930 --> 00:57:57,790
Yeah, you!

1710
00:57:59,130 --> 00:58:00,450
Oh, I found a jungle.

1711
00:58:00,730 --> 00:58:01,890
Did you ever find a jungle?

1712
00:58:02,650 --> 00:58:03,130
No.

1713
00:58:03,770 --> 00:58:07,130
I found, like, an above-ground mineshaft.

1714
00:58:07,690 --> 00:58:09,030
Oh, yeah, you're definitely in the Mesa.

1715
00:58:09,130 --> 00:58:09,830
Don't go in there.

1716
00:58:10,010 --> 00:58:10,570
Don't do it.

1717
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:11,390
Don't go in there.

1718
00:58:11,730 --> 00:58:13,030
Don't go in there.

1719
00:58:13,110 --> 00:58:16,290
Don't go in there.

1720
00:58:16,290 --> 00:58:17,690
I found a real village.

1721
00:58:17,870 --> 00:58:19,670
I found...

1722
00:58:19,670 --> 00:58:22,030
Now I'm actually for real.

1723
00:58:22,150 --> 00:58:22,910
I found a village.

1724
00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:24,550
It's in front of the...

1725
00:58:24,550 --> 00:58:26,890
It's in front of the above-ground mineshaft.

1726
00:58:28,370 --> 00:58:31,690
Wait, what's the key to find coordinates?

1727
00:58:33,170 --> 00:58:33,650
What?

1728
00:58:34,050 --> 00:58:34,970
To show coordinates.

1729
00:58:35,090 --> 00:58:35,630
What is it?

1730
00:58:35,770 --> 00:58:37,810
Alright, I'll give you my coordinates.

1731
00:58:37,810 --> 00:58:38,190
Wait.

1732
00:58:38,390 --> 00:58:39,350
Okay, there you go.

1733
00:58:40,550 --> 00:58:41,630
Oh, I got obsidian!

1734
00:58:42,750 --> 00:58:43,170
Oh, nice.

1735
00:58:44,350 --> 00:58:44,630
Okay.

1736
00:58:46,650 --> 00:58:48,150
Alright, you gotta come over to me.

1737
00:58:48,250 --> 00:58:49,190
You gotta leave that jungle.

1738
00:58:49,770 --> 00:58:50,490
A deal's a deal.

1739
00:58:50,790 --> 00:58:51,610
You gotta leave.

1740
00:58:51,710 --> 00:58:52,730
A deal's a deal.

1741
00:58:52,930 --> 00:58:54,590
A deal's a deal!

1742
00:58:55,070 --> 00:58:55,470
No!

1743
00:58:56,650 --> 00:58:57,470
I don't want chocolate!

1744
00:58:57,610 --> 00:58:59,150
I wanna fucking kill the ender dragon!

1745
00:59:01,330 --> 00:59:03,950
What if that includes...

1746
00:59:03,950 --> 00:59:05,410
Oh, yeah, the two-for-one deal.

1747
00:59:05,410 --> 00:59:06,950
You get chocolate and an ender dragon.

1748
00:59:07,170 --> 00:59:08,190
Yeah, exactly.

1749
00:59:08,430 --> 00:59:12,730
I would be surprised if we would make it to the ender dragon on this seed.

1750
00:59:14,110 --> 00:59:15,650
I think we can do it.

1751
00:59:16,030 --> 00:59:17,010
Alright, get over here!

1752
00:59:17,110 --> 00:59:18,390
Get out of the fucking jungle!

1753
00:59:19,090 --> 00:59:20,910
Hold on, and I'm looking around.

1754
00:59:21,070 --> 00:59:22,610
Uh-oh, this goes to a dark wood.

1755
00:59:22,790 --> 00:59:25,210
I swear to God, if you die after I try...

1756
00:59:25,210 --> 00:59:26,710
I've worked so hard getting here.

1757
00:59:26,790 --> 00:59:27,490
I swear to God.

1758
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:28,630
Wait, where are you at?

1759
00:59:28,910 --> 00:59:30,730
You didn't even send me your coordinates, you idiot!

1760
00:59:30,730 --> 00:59:33,410
My coordinates is...

1761
00:59:33,410 --> 00:59:34,510
Type it in the chat!

1762
00:59:35,190 --> 00:59:38,970
X -471.3 I'm not gonna pay attention to this.

1763
00:59:38,970 --> 00:59:40,750
Alright, someone in the chat's gonna type this out.

1764
00:59:41,130 --> 00:59:50,110
X-471.336 X-471.336 X -471.336 Alright, someone in the chat will type that out.

1765
00:59:50,390 --> 00:59:51,430
Your chat's smart.

1766
00:59:52,590 --> 00:59:54,570
Oh, she's quite smart, you guys.

1767
00:59:56,630 --> 00:59:57,890
I'm getting more...

1768
00:59:57,890 --> 00:59:59,910
Oh, this is actually good if I can get some bamboo.

1769
01:00:00,350 --> 01:00:01,070
Bamboos are good.

1770
01:00:01,070 --> 01:00:02,670
Where the fuck are you gonna do a bamboo?

1771
01:00:03,350 --> 01:00:03,910
It's wood!

1772
01:00:04,050 --> 01:00:04,570
It's wood!

1773
01:00:05,050 --> 01:00:05,890
You don't need wood!

1774
01:00:05,970 --> 01:00:07,330
There's so much wood around us!

1775
01:00:07,410 --> 01:00:09,010
Like, what do you need more wood for?

1776
01:00:09,330 --> 01:00:10,350
It's easy wood!

1777
01:00:10,850 --> 01:00:12,530
Oh my God, you don't need more wood.

1778
01:00:12,930 --> 01:00:13,650
You don't.

1779
01:00:13,710 --> 01:00:14,190
You don't.

1780
01:00:14,350 --> 01:00:15,690
I watch the video.

1781
01:00:20,750 --> 01:00:24,170
And how come after watching the video, we died four times?

1782
01:00:24,790 --> 01:00:25,770
Or three times?

1783
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:28,310
Okay, what are the secrets?

1784
01:00:28,310 --> 01:00:30,250
Aren't you supposed to tell me what the secrets are?

1785
01:00:30,370 --> 01:00:32,790
Aren't you supposed to help as a teammate?

1786
01:00:33,490 --> 01:00:35,310
We have to make shields.

1787
01:00:36,030 --> 01:00:37,230
So we gotta get iron.

1788
01:00:37,430 --> 01:00:37,890
Okay.

1789
01:00:40,350 --> 01:00:42,990
Find iron in the village.

1790
01:00:43,930 --> 01:00:45,150
Loot them for all they're worth.

1791
01:00:45,870 --> 01:00:47,650
I am trying to find iron.

1792
01:00:48,370 --> 01:00:49,350
What was the coordinates, guys?

1793
01:00:49,550 --> 01:00:56,030
Oh my God, the little babies are fighting.

1794
01:00:56,030 --> 01:00:57,170
471.

1795
01:00:57,810 --> 01:00:58,450
471?

1796
01:00:59,270 --> 01:00:59,910
Seriously?

1797
01:01:00,630 --> 01:01:01,270
Oh my God.

1798
01:01:02,070 --> 01:01:02,710
411.

1799
01:01:03,250 --> 01:01:05,970
Your chat isn't even typing the right coordinates.

1800
01:01:06,790 --> 01:01:08,030
Negative 411.

1801
01:01:11,730 --> 01:01:13,570
Oh my God, I took a fucking screenshot.

1802
01:01:14,010 --> 01:01:14,650
411.

1803
01:01:15,490 --> 01:01:16,930
Oh wait, it was 71 because I moved.

1804
01:01:17,490 --> 01:01:18,370
Oh my God.

1805
01:01:22,150 --> 01:01:24,030
Negative 410.744.

1806
01:01:28,550 --> 01:01:29,510
278.330.

1807
01:01:29,910 --> 01:01:31,850
I forgot I can move.

1808
01:01:32,510 --> 01:01:34,030
Oh, X is negative?

1809
01:01:34,310 --> 01:01:34,910
Oh my God.

1810
01:01:36,890 --> 01:01:38,690
That's like the first coordinate.

1811
01:01:39,310 --> 01:01:41,510
How did you get confused with the X?

1812
01:01:43,510 --> 01:01:45,290
It's the first thing I read.

1813
01:01:45,630 --> 01:01:46,550
You have a bed, right?

1814
01:01:46,950 --> 01:01:48,070
Yeah, I have several beds.

1815
01:01:48,690 --> 01:01:49,930
I'm literally in a village.

1816
01:01:52,190 --> 01:01:53,470
Type in chat, it's easier.

1817
01:01:53,470 --> 01:01:54,670
No, she has to work for it.

1818
01:01:55,330 --> 01:01:56,810
Oh, there's a cat here.

1819
01:01:57,230 --> 01:01:59,470
She doesn't want to work as a team, you guys.

1820
01:01:59,590 --> 01:02:00,650
If I die, it's all Doki's fault.

1821
01:02:00,810 --> 01:02:04,890
Yeah, I fucking found the village for us.

1822
01:02:05,050 --> 01:02:05,670
And we had a deal.

1823
01:02:05,670 --> 01:02:07,630
I found the village before and you blamed me.

1824
01:02:07,730 --> 01:02:10,270
So I guess whoever finds the village first is the person...

1825
01:02:10,270 --> 01:02:14,450
No, I blamed you for not fucking protecting me.

1826
01:02:17,410 --> 01:02:19,490
I hope we die in this run.

1827
01:02:24,090 --> 01:02:25,830
I'm going to fucking jump off the cliff right now.

1828
01:02:25,910 --> 01:02:26,590
And we're going to restart this.

1829
01:02:28,410 --> 01:02:31,150
You're going to get to the village.

1830
01:02:31,630 --> 01:02:33,030
You're going to get to the village.

1831
01:02:33,370 --> 01:02:34,810
And I'm going to get that cork gun.

1832
01:02:37,350 --> 01:02:38,590
You'll make it a spectacle.

1833
01:02:38,890 --> 01:02:40,470
All the villagers will be watching you.

1834
01:02:41,750 --> 01:02:43,470
Don't do it, don't do it, don't do it.

1835
01:02:44,210 --> 01:02:45,930
Wait, you guys, what was the coordinates again?

1836
01:02:48,790 --> 01:02:49,710
What were the coordinates again?

1837
01:02:49,710 --> 01:02:52,930
I got us a ton of hit.

1838
01:02:54,910 --> 01:02:56,810
I'm eating, I'm having dinner.

1839
01:02:57,290 --> 01:02:57,950
At twilight.

1840
01:02:59,570 --> 01:03:00,690
471, 304.

1841
01:03:02,190 --> 01:03:05,710
I have so much worthless shit in my inventory.

1842
01:03:07,410 --> 01:03:08,850
Let's sleep, can we sleep?

1843
01:03:09,310 --> 01:03:12,810
Sleep, please, before the zombies come.

1844
01:03:15,110 --> 01:03:16,670
You're not asleep, you're not asleep.

1845
01:03:16,670 --> 01:03:17,150
You're not asleep.

1846
01:03:21,070 --> 01:03:25,050
Maya, I'm working so hard for this group.

1847
01:03:26,210 --> 01:03:28,430
I have so much resources right now.

1848
01:03:28,430 --> 01:03:29,010
Oh yeah, what?

1849
01:03:29,070 --> 01:03:30,110
What do you have?

1850
01:03:30,450 --> 01:03:32,490
I have meat.

1851
01:03:32,710 --> 01:03:35,370
I have lots of stone.

1852
01:03:35,530 --> 01:03:36,590
I have lots of food.

1853
01:03:36,890 --> 01:03:40,090
I have lots of coal.

1854
01:03:40,450 --> 01:03:41,130
Yeah, do you have iron?

1855
01:03:41,970 --> 01:03:42,830
I have one iron.

1856
01:03:44,330 --> 01:03:45,850
Lots of resources.

1857
01:03:46,190 --> 01:03:47,550
Well, how many iron do you have?

1858
01:03:48,330 --> 01:03:49,150
I don't need iron.

1859
01:03:51,030 --> 01:03:53,030
I have a golden...

1860
01:03:53,030 --> 01:03:54,770
I have a golden pickaxe.

1861
01:03:54,790 --> 01:03:55,670
I have a golden pickaxe.

1862
01:03:55,670 --> 01:03:59,570
I have a golden pickaxe with mending on it.

1863
01:04:01,110 --> 01:04:02,530
I have a golden...

1864
01:04:02,530 --> 01:04:04,030
It's literally the same as iron.

1865
01:04:04,150 --> 01:04:05,170
It's the same as iron.

1866
01:04:06,850 --> 01:04:08,450
It's the same as iron.

1867
01:04:08,610 --> 01:04:10,690
It has the same stats as iron.

1868
01:04:10,690 --> 01:04:12,530
No, it doesn't.

1869
01:04:12,730 --> 01:04:13,550
It breaks sooner.

1870
01:04:14,070 --> 01:04:16,490
Not mine, because it has mending on it.

1871
01:04:17,790 --> 01:04:19,590
Okay, you're going to get experience.

1872
01:04:19,990 --> 01:04:21,790
I want to see that happen.

1873
01:04:24,550 --> 01:04:28,370
I bet it's going to last longer than your fucking iron pickaxe.

1874
01:04:28,390 --> 01:04:29,730
It actually will.

1875
01:04:30,570 --> 01:04:32,410
It actually will.

1876
01:04:34,290 --> 01:04:37,130
I want to see you dig down with that thing and be like...

1877
01:04:37,130 --> 01:04:39,610
Oh no, it has mending though.

1878
01:04:42,490 --> 01:04:43,010
It does.

1879
01:04:43,010 --> 01:04:43,990
That's right, it does.

1880
01:04:46,070 --> 01:04:48,390
Yeah, the mending doesn't do shit unless you have...

1881
01:04:48,390 --> 01:04:51,270
It doesn't do shit unless you have ways to...

1882
01:04:51,270 --> 01:04:53,070
Like an experience bar.

1883
01:04:53,190 --> 01:04:53,610
Exactly.

1884
01:04:54,090 --> 01:04:55,310
I'll wait until it's night time.

1885
01:04:57,870 --> 01:04:59,190
In the cave, huh?

1886
01:04:59,270 --> 01:05:00,930
In the cave, exactly.

1887
01:05:02,250 --> 01:05:03,750
Where the fuck are you?

1888
01:05:04,270 --> 01:05:06,010
I'm in the mesa biome.

1889
01:05:06,090 --> 01:05:07,130
I'm almost there.

1890
01:05:07,130 --> 01:05:08,250
Oh my god.

1891
01:05:08,310 --> 01:05:11,450
I'm going to make sure you get here, and then I'm going to jump off this roof.

1892
01:05:11,950 --> 01:05:13,230
I think I went too far.

1893
01:05:13,630 --> 01:05:14,610
You were at 400?

1894
01:05:15,170 --> 01:05:17,110
Yeah, negative 410.

1895
01:05:19,230 --> 01:05:20,510
But it was like 300.

1896
01:05:20,770 --> 01:05:21,630
I think I went too far.

1897
01:05:23,290 --> 01:05:25,310
Oh my god, chill out.

1898
01:05:25,450 --> 01:05:27,270
We are just stuck together as a team.

1899
01:05:27,870 --> 01:05:29,850
You walked away first!

1900
01:05:31,030 --> 01:05:34,290
You can't say that when you literally walked away first.

1901
01:05:34,290 --> 01:05:35,630
You literally...

1902
01:05:35,630 --> 01:05:39,330
You started off by walking away from me.

1903
01:05:40,830 --> 01:05:42,290
No, I'm just...

1904
01:05:42,290 --> 01:05:43,470
I get things done.

1905
01:05:43,670 --> 01:05:44,790
I'm ready to go.

1906
01:05:45,050 --> 01:05:46,770
Oh yeah, you get things done?

1907
01:05:46,930 --> 01:05:48,970
Where was the village that you found?

1908
01:05:49,290 --> 01:05:52,930
I have found two villages so far, and you found literally one.

1909
01:05:53,050 --> 01:05:54,350
Okay, get off your high horse.

1910
01:05:54,630 --> 01:05:56,450
You didn't find that village.

1911
01:05:56,770 --> 01:05:57,750
Yes, I did!

1912
01:05:58,790 --> 01:06:02,850
I found all villages so far, except this one.

1913
01:06:02,850 --> 01:06:04,170
Yeah, the hardest one.

1914
01:06:04,350 --> 01:06:06,030
You got the easy...

1915
01:06:06,030 --> 01:06:10,370
Yeah, because you wandered off first, so of course you'd find the easy villages first.

1916
01:06:10,630 --> 01:06:13,190
That's like, you know, when you kill a level 1 player...

1917
01:06:13,190 --> 01:06:15,710
You basically did like a level 1 strat.

1918
01:06:15,890 --> 01:06:16,470
And I...

1919
01:06:16,470 --> 01:06:19,170
I was doing a level 30 area.

1920
01:06:19,470 --> 01:06:20,030
Oh yeah, yeah.

1921
01:06:20,270 --> 01:06:23,790
Who told you that this biome would have a village?

1922
01:06:24,130 --> 01:06:26,470
Oh, every biome has a village.

1923
01:06:26,730 --> 01:06:27,470
Except for snow.

1924
01:06:28,570 --> 01:06:29,790
No, actually no, snow does.

1925
01:06:29,850 --> 01:06:30,330
Never mind.

1926
01:06:32,850 --> 01:06:34,190
Every biome has a village.

1927
01:06:34,710 --> 01:06:37,530
Yeah, but this one usually has a village.

1928
01:06:38,510 --> 01:06:39,810
Yeah, what's the percentage?

1929
01:06:40,350 --> 01:06:41,210
What's the percentage?

1930
01:06:42,050 --> 01:06:45,250
I don't know, I just have a magic mind.

1931
01:06:46,390 --> 01:06:47,290
Oh, so you're just...

1932
01:06:47,290 --> 01:06:49,250
You're basing it off of...

1933
01:06:49,250 --> 01:06:51,090
Not even science, off of magic.

1934
01:06:51,430 --> 01:06:52,510
That's not even science.

1935
01:06:53,050 --> 01:06:55,010
You're not even basing it off of science.

1936
01:06:55,210 --> 01:06:56,310
It's off of belief.

1937
01:06:57,350 --> 01:06:58,910
Yeah, my belief is what I know.

1938
01:06:58,910 --> 01:07:00,270
You believe in the Minecraft gods.

1939
01:07:03,170 --> 01:07:05,170
I believe in magic.

1940
01:07:05,490 --> 01:07:07,030
In a young girl's heart.

1941
01:07:08,130 --> 01:07:10,510
She believes in the heart of the cards, guys.

1942
01:07:10,530 --> 01:07:11,390
The heart of the cards.

1943
01:07:12,330 --> 01:07:14,870
I literally own Exodia, okay?

1944
01:07:15,150 --> 01:07:17,570
Oh my god, where the fuck are you?

1945
01:07:17,890 --> 01:07:18,630
I'm coming!

1946
01:07:19,330 --> 01:07:20,510
No you're not!

1947
01:07:20,990 --> 01:07:22,170
I'm just waiting here.

1948
01:07:22,410 --> 01:07:24,770
I don't even need to do anything anymore.

1949
01:07:25,430 --> 01:07:26,710
Did you get everything from the village?

1950
01:07:26,710 --> 01:07:27,830
Yes, I got everything.

1951
01:07:28,070 --> 01:07:29,150
Did you get all the torches?

1952
01:07:29,150 --> 01:07:31,130
Yes, I got all the torches, yes.

1953
01:07:31,890 --> 01:07:32,530
What else did you get?

1954
01:07:32,750 --> 01:07:33,670
I got all the hay.

1955
01:07:34,490 --> 01:07:35,370
What else was there?

1956
01:07:35,590 --> 01:07:37,230
What was in the boxes?

1957
01:07:37,770 --> 01:07:38,490
It was nothing.

1958
01:07:38,750 --> 01:07:40,630
It was books, it was...

1959
01:07:41,630 --> 01:07:42,430
Books and...

1960
01:07:42,430 --> 01:07:43,150
What's in my inventory?

1961
01:07:43,350 --> 01:07:43,870
I don't even know.

1962
01:07:44,010 --> 01:07:45,830
Oh my god, it's not even this biome.

1963
01:07:46,310 --> 01:07:48,430
What do you mean it's not even this biome?

1964
01:07:48,530 --> 01:07:49,310
It's a sand biome one.

1965
01:07:50,510 --> 01:07:54,990
Oh, did you go to that nether thing?

1966
01:07:55,510 --> 01:07:56,110
Yeah, I did.

1967
01:07:57,030 --> 01:07:57,830
I did.

1968
01:07:58,450 --> 01:07:58,970
Okay.

1969
01:08:00,730 --> 01:08:02,110
Is she telling the truth, chat?

1970
01:08:02,350 --> 01:08:03,030
I did.

1971
01:08:03,850 --> 01:08:05,190
I want a different bed.

1972
01:08:05,470 --> 01:08:06,290
I want a green one.

1973
01:08:06,570 --> 01:08:07,430
There's greens here.

1974
01:08:07,830 --> 01:08:08,850
I know, I'm grabbing them.

1975
01:08:08,990 --> 01:08:09,530
Oh, you're here?

1976
01:08:10,110 --> 01:08:10,410
Yeah.

1977
01:08:11,190 --> 01:08:12,070
Oh my god.

1978
01:08:13,390 --> 01:08:14,390
I see you.

1979
01:08:17,270 --> 01:08:18,290
Alright, are you ready?

1980
01:08:19,390 --> 01:08:21,090
I left some hay for you.

1981
01:08:21,170 --> 01:08:23,090
Oh my god, this guy is fucking the sheep.

1982
01:08:23,630 --> 01:08:24,150
What?

1983
01:08:25,450 --> 01:08:26,770
Oh, okay, they're done.

1984
01:08:29,370 --> 01:08:31,810
I'm glad I wasn't here to witness that.

1985
01:08:32,610 --> 01:08:33,650
We're in New Zealand.

1986
01:08:34,690 --> 01:08:35,190
What?

1987
01:08:39,370 --> 01:08:40,650
I'm sorry, New Zealand.

1988
01:08:41,170 --> 01:08:43,510
Hey, you didn't get all the torches.

1989
01:08:43,930 --> 01:08:45,990
There's literally torches in here.

1990
01:08:46,150 --> 01:08:47,330
There's torches all around.

1991
01:08:47,570 --> 01:08:48,810
I left them for you.

1992
01:08:48,870 --> 01:08:49,710
I left them for you.

1993
01:08:49,710 --> 01:08:50,970
I left them for you.

1994
01:08:52,270 --> 01:08:53,810
Did you get all the torches?

1995
01:08:53,990 --> 01:08:55,430
And you said, yep, I got all the torches.

1996
01:08:55,490 --> 01:08:56,910
I left them for you.

1997
01:08:57,270 --> 01:08:58,170
You're a liar.

1998
01:09:00,410 --> 01:09:01,090
You're lazy.

1999
01:09:01,730 --> 01:09:02,490
You were here for so long.

2000
01:09:02,530 --> 01:09:04,010
No, I was not lazy.

2001
01:09:04,190 --> 01:09:07,070
I left them because I was being a considerate teammate.

2002
01:09:07,570 --> 01:09:08,630
I was like, you know what?

2003
01:09:08,730 --> 01:09:10,230
I'm gonna leave these torches for a minute.

2004
01:09:10,330 --> 01:09:11,670
I bet she'll need them too.

2005
01:09:13,410 --> 01:09:15,110
You didn't get any of them, did you?

2006
01:09:15,690 --> 01:09:16,470
No, I did.

2007
01:09:16,470 --> 01:09:19,030
I have 50 torches in my inventory.

2008
01:09:20,270 --> 01:09:21,070
50 torches?

2009
01:09:21,390 --> 01:09:21,650
Yeah.

2010
01:09:23,110 --> 01:09:24,050
I have 51.

2011
01:09:25,570 --> 01:09:25,850
Chat, is this real?

2012
01:09:27,310 --> 01:09:28,110
52, 53.

2013
01:09:28,290 --> 01:09:30,230
You don't deserve any of these torches.

2014
01:09:30,350 --> 01:09:31,130
I'm taking them back.

2015
01:09:33,990 --> 01:09:35,670
I'm taking all of them back now.

2016
01:09:36,010 --> 01:09:36,730
You deserve them.

2017
01:09:36,770 --> 01:09:39,250
You can put all of them in the caves then.

2018
01:09:39,930 --> 01:09:41,990
We gotta get iron before we go into the caves.

2019
01:09:42,330 --> 01:09:42,790
No, we don't.

2020
01:09:42,850 --> 01:09:44,070
We just go in the cave to get iron.

2021
01:09:44,070 --> 01:09:45,610
Don't we need to get the iron so that...

2022
01:09:45,610 --> 01:09:46,150
No, we don't.

2023
01:09:46,230 --> 01:09:47,770
I believe in us.

2024
01:09:48,090 --> 01:09:49,090
I don't.

2025
01:09:49,190 --> 01:09:50,370
We died two times.

2026
01:09:50,830 --> 01:09:52,810
One time was in the cave.

2027
01:09:53,250 --> 01:09:53,690
One time.

2028
01:09:53,730 --> 01:09:54,790
The other time I slipped.

2029
01:09:55,770 --> 01:09:56,770
You slipped?

2030
01:09:58,170 --> 01:10:00,210
Oh, so finally it's her fault.

2031
01:10:00,470 --> 01:10:01,430
She finally took the blame.

2032
01:10:01,430 --> 01:10:05,810
I slipped because you didn't warn me about the giant...

2033
01:10:12,170 --> 01:10:14,610
I think we gotta get some iron.

2034
01:10:15,150 --> 01:10:16,110
Where are you?

2035
01:10:16,190 --> 01:10:17,050
Where did you go?

2036
01:10:17,730 --> 01:10:18,930
Kill the iron golem?

2037
01:10:18,990 --> 01:10:19,970
He'll kill us first.

2038
01:10:20,530 --> 01:10:21,090
We're too...

2039
01:10:21,090 --> 01:10:21,490
Wait, no.

2040
01:10:21,570 --> 01:10:23,390
Not if we stand up and kill him.

2041
01:10:23,850 --> 01:10:25,230
Like, stand on these pillars.

2042
01:10:25,950 --> 01:10:26,990
We need...

2043
01:10:26,990 --> 01:10:28,010
What's it called?

2044
01:10:29,210 --> 01:10:29,730
What?

2045
01:10:30,350 --> 01:10:31,390
We need armor.

2046
01:10:32,110 --> 01:10:33,570
No, we don't.

2047
01:10:33,710 --> 01:10:34,930
Yes, we do.

2048
01:10:35,310 --> 01:10:35,750
No, we don't.

2049
01:10:36,310 --> 01:10:38,710
We'll find armor in the fucking caves.

2050
01:10:39,070 --> 01:10:40,330
Why are you so scared?

2051
01:10:40,790 --> 01:10:41,950
Why do you mean we need...

2052
01:10:41,950 --> 01:10:43,170
We'll find it in the caves.

2053
01:10:43,230 --> 01:10:44,970
Do you think armor just grows in caves?

2054
01:10:44,990 --> 01:10:49,350
No, we find the iron to make the armor in the caves.

2055
01:10:51,010 --> 01:10:52,210
Why are you so scared?

2056
01:10:53,510 --> 01:10:55,500
Because we've died three times.

2057
01:10:57,070 --> 01:10:59,090
Yeah, but that's not my fault.

2058
01:11:05,630 --> 01:11:06,310
You guys...

2059
01:11:06,310 --> 01:11:07,590
You guys...

2060
01:11:07,590 --> 01:11:08,210
I think we...

2061
01:11:08,210 --> 01:11:09,730
I feel like we need like a poll.

2062
01:11:11,070 --> 01:11:12,490
Who's in the right here?

2063
01:11:12,650 --> 01:11:13,590
What kind of poll?

2064
01:11:18,710 --> 01:11:19,670
I feel...

2065
01:11:19,670 --> 01:11:20,730
You feel...

2066
01:11:20,730 --> 01:11:21,870
This is the...

2067
01:11:21,870 --> 01:11:22,670
This is the run.

2068
01:11:23,470 --> 01:11:25,790
If we die in this run...

2069
01:11:25,790 --> 01:11:29,910
Everyone will make fun of us.

2070
01:11:29,910 --> 01:11:30,790
We...

2071
01:11:31,270 --> 01:11:33,910
I don't want them to make fun of us.

2072
01:11:34,570 --> 01:11:36,570
It will take us 20 days.

2073
01:11:36,870 --> 01:11:38,130
Where are you?

2074
01:11:38,610 --> 01:11:39,590
Where did you go?

2075
01:11:39,590 --> 01:11:40,930
I'm gathering...

2076
01:11:40,930 --> 01:11:42,330
I'm gathering torches.

2077
01:11:42,530 --> 01:11:43,210
Okay, are you ready?

2078
01:11:44,070 --> 01:11:46,790
Okay, we can head straight and see if we bump into a mountain.

2079
01:11:47,450 --> 01:11:48,710
Does that satisfy you?

2080
01:11:48,830 --> 01:11:49,510
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2081
01:11:49,610 --> 01:11:50,670
Do you need bread?

2082
01:11:52,510 --> 01:11:52,970
Eventually.

2083
01:11:53,730 --> 01:11:54,710
No, just take the bread now.

2084
01:11:54,710 --> 01:11:55,870
Here, I'm gonna throw it at you.

2085
01:11:55,910 --> 01:11:56,710
I'm gonna make it ring.

2086
01:12:02,540 --> 01:12:03,920
Make it ring!

2087
01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:04,880
Oh, oh, oh.

2088
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:06,620
Wait, wait, wait.

2089
01:12:06,720 --> 01:12:09,900
Wait, did you not mean to throw it at me?

2090
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:13,760
I accidentally threw like the entire...

2091
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:14,400
That's fine.

2092
01:12:14,820 --> 01:12:16,080
I have another stack.

2093
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:17,900
Yeah, don't worry about it, everybody.

2094
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:18,340
We're good.

2095
01:12:18,860 --> 01:12:19,160
Okay.

2096
01:12:20,580 --> 01:12:21,720
I believe in us.

2097
01:12:21,720 --> 01:12:22,480
This is the run.

2098
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:24,620
This is the run.

2099
01:12:24,740 --> 01:12:26,380
Wouldn't it be funny if we find...

2100
01:12:26,380 --> 01:12:27,440
If we find...

2101
01:12:27,980 --> 01:12:29,840
Frogs before we find...

2102
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:30,300
Iron?

2103
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:36,620
Oh, that's the temple you were talking about, right?

2104
01:12:36,660 --> 01:12:37,800
No, that's a different temple.

2105
01:12:38,820 --> 01:12:39,040
Oh.

2106
01:12:39,380 --> 01:12:41,300
Oh, yeah, teach me how to do this.

2107
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:42,500
Yeah, yeah, I can teach you.

2108
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:45,780
Okay, it's really delicate though, okay?

2109
01:12:46,020 --> 01:12:46,340
Okay.

2110
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:49,020
Do you want me to be in there?

2111
01:12:49,020 --> 01:12:51,500
Do you want me to go inside?

2112
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:54,060
You can watch from a distance.

2113
01:12:54,160 --> 01:12:55,320
Oh, I can watch from above.

2114
01:12:55,820 --> 01:12:57,520
There might be someone in here, so...

2115
01:12:57,520 --> 01:12:58,340
Get your stuff out.

2116
01:12:59,260 --> 01:13:00,240
Alright, I'll watch from here.

2117
01:13:00,980 --> 01:13:02,780
I'm giving you cinematic mode right now.

2118
01:13:03,240 --> 01:13:04,460
Alright, hold on, I need my torches.

2119
01:13:05,980 --> 01:13:08,060
Okay, I'm gonna torch this up a little bit.

2120
01:13:08,140 --> 01:13:08,480
Alright.

2121
01:13:09,180 --> 01:13:09,580
Okay.

2122
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:10,760
I'm watching.

2123
01:13:11,900 --> 01:13:13,960
Okay, I like to start from the one over here.

2124
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:14,380
Can you see?

2125
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:15,480
Yeah, yeah, I can see.

2126
01:13:15,480 --> 01:13:16,520
You can?

2127
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:21,800
Alright, so I like to come in slowly.

2128
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:24,080
Okay, so this is where...

2129
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:24,320
Yeah.

2130
01:13:24,460 --> 01:13:27,480
You have to start making your...

2131
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:29,620
Okay.

2132
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:32,180
And what happens?

2133
01:13:33,140 --> 01:13:34,920
And then I get to the bottom and I win.

2134
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:36,640
And I get all the treasure.

2135
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:37,600
Okay.

2136
01:13:37,700 --> 01:13:40,200
But you have to disable the button before you do anything.

2137
01:13:40,620 --> 01:13:42,280
Did you get the button?

2138
01:13:42,760 --> 01:13:44,600
No, I'm making my way to the bottom.

2139
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:46,860
Wait, can you dig some of the parts above us?

2140
01:13:46,900 --> 01:13:47,980
So I can have a better view?

2141
01:13:48,820 --> 01:13:50,260
No, I can't do that.

2142
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:52,260
No, I can't do that.

2143
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:54,040
No, I can't do that.

2144
01:13:54,040 --> 01:13:55,480
But I can't see anything.

2145
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:56,780
You'll see.

2146
01:13:57,460 --> 01:13:58,380
Hold on, can you see?

2147
01:13:59,240 --> 01:14:00,180
Wait, I'm almost there.

2148
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:01,060
I'm almost there.

2149
01:14:01,180 --> 01:14:01,780
No, I can't.

2150
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:03,900
There's literally...

2151
01:14:03,900 --> 01:14:04,320
Okay!

2152
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:06,920
Oh, yeah, you can't see.

2153
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:07,860
Hold on, I'll come back up.

2154
01:14:07,860 --> 01:14:10,460
Okay, just dig around here.

2155
01:14:10,460 --> 01:14:12,120
So I can have like a view.

2156
01:14:12,500 --> 01:14:13,740
You can come in now, actually.

2157
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,160
Oh wait, did you get it?

2158
01:14:15,420 --> 01:14:16,760
So we need to put a bed in here.

2159
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:18,720
Oh, armor trim!

2160
01:14:26,330 --> 01:14:28,310
Okay, so a zombie might fall here.

2161
01:14:28,390 --> 01:14:29,730
So I'm gonna...

2162
01:14:29,730 --> 01:14:31,150
What do you mean a zombie might fall?

2163
01:14:31,230 --> 01:14:33,710
Because it's night time.

2164
01:14:34,210 --> 01:14:35,330
Okay, I'm asleep.

2165
01:14:37,230 --> 01:14:40,170
A zombie might have fallen into our heads.

2166
01:14:43,450 --> 01:14:44,410
Oh, enchanted!

2167
01:14:44,590 --> 01:14:45,330
Oh, a sata!

2168
01:14:46,110 --> 01:14:47,270
Oh, we need gunpowder.

2169
01:14:47,550 --> 01:14:49,790
I'm just gonna grab gunpowder for the sake of it.

2170
01:14:51,110 --> 01:14:52,290
Oh, we need string?

2171
01:14:53,250 --> 01:14:54,630
Um, I don't know.

2172
01:14:55,250 --> 01:14:56,410
I'll grab some bones.

2173
01:14:57,270 --> 01:14:58,010
Actually, we do.

2174
01:14:58,250 --> 01:15:01,430
We need to make a bow and arrows, probably.

2175
01:15:01,610 --> 01:15:02,790
We don't need copper, right?

2176
01:15:03,610 --> 01:15:04,090
No.

2177
01:15:04,470 --> 01:15:05,790
Okay, I'm getting that out.

2178
01:15:08,310 --> 01:15:08,790
Uh...

2179
01:15:08,790 --> 01:15:09,310
I'll take the string.

2180
01:15:10,850 --> 01:15:11,750
I'll take the string.

2181
01:15:13,430 --> 01:15:15,350
Alright, I think I have too much stuff.

2182
01:15:15,670 --> 01:15:16,870
What's the fire charge for?

2183
01:15:16,950 --> 01:15:17,710
Will we need that?

2184
01:15:18,710 --> 01:15:19,150
No.

2185
01:15:19,590 --> 01:15:20,690
I don't think so.

2186
01:15:22,070 --> 01:15:23,830
Okay, I'm gonna dig my way out of here.

2187
01:15:26,490 --> 01:15:27,370
There's stairs.

2188
01:15:27,590 --> 01:15:28,390
There's literal stairs.

2189
01:15:28,830 --> 01:15:29,590
I've created.

2190
01:15:29,830 --> 01:15:30,170
Where?

2191
01:15:30,950 --> 01:15:31,790
Actual stairs.

2192
01:15:31,910 --> 01:15:32,530
No, you didn't.

2193
01:15:32,530 --> 01:15:33,610
Yes, I did.

2194
01:15:33,990 --> 01:15:34,470
You didn't.

2195
01:15:34,610 --> 01:15:36,130
You have to keep creating them.

2196
01:15:36,230 --> 01:15:36,510
Exactly.

2197
01:15:37,370 --> 01:15:39,730
I'm trying to create the stairs for us.

2198
01:15:40,110 --> 01:15:41,510
Just place blocks.

2199
01:15:42,090 --> 01:15:43,130
Oh my God.

2200
01:15:44,470 --> 01:15:45,450
Like that.

2201
01:15:46,030 --> 01:15:47,650
I did it.

2202
01:15:47,990 --> 01:15:48,910
Yeah, you did it.

2203
01:15:49,730 --> 01:15:50,610
Thank you.

2204
01:15:51,770 --> 01:15:53,030
Taking my torches back.

2205
01:15:54,250 --> 01:15:56,310
There's a creeper in front of us, by the way.

2206
01:15:58,270 --> 01:15:58,870
No.

2207
01:16:00,350 --> 01:16:00,710
No.

2208
01:16:00,710 --> 01:16:01,890
And he's like, oh wait, he disappeared.

2209
01:16:01,990 --> 01:16:02,590
Oh no, he's over there.

2210
01:16:02,650 --> 01:16:03,250
He walked away.

2211
01:16:04,050 --> 01:16:05,230
Alright, get over here.

2212
01:16:05,290 --> 01:16:05,610
Come on.

2213
01:16:05,690 --> 01:16:06,730
We gotta find your iron.

2214
01:16:07,250 --> 01:16:08,210
Where's the creeper?

2215
01:16:09,770 --> 01:16:10,810
That's a cactus, idiot.

2216
01:16:12,430 --> 01:16:13,330
Looking for you.

2217
01:16:14,110 --> 01:16:14,690
Looking for you.

2218
01:16:16,370 --> 01:16:17,970
Yeah, you wanna call me an idiot again?

2219
01:16:18,130 --> 01:16:19,930
You wanna go up to this cactus?

2220
01:16:20,510 --> 01:16:21,450
Go up to the cactus.

2221
01:16:21,610 --> 01:16:21,950
Come on.

2222
01:16:22,090 --> 01:16:22,990
Go up to the cactus.

2223
01:16:24,710 --> 01:16:25,430
Kill him.

2224
01:16:25,430 --> 01:16:26,250
Kill him.

2225
01:16:26,370 --> 01:16:27,570
Kill him.

2226
01:16:28,210 --> 01:16:30,090
Why are you not doing anything?

2227
01:16:31,670 --> 01:16:32,850
He's aggravated.

2228
01:16:33,850 --> 01:16:35,130
Good job.

2229
01:16:35,390 --> 01:16:36,130
You did nothing.

2230
01:16:36,670 --> 01:16:38,150
You did absolutely nothing.

2231
01:16:38,630 --> 01:16:39,450
You're a coward.

2232
01:16:39,610 --> 01:16:40,310
You're a little chicken.

2233
01:16:40,650 --> 01:16:41,910
A coward would've ran away.

2234
01:16:42,010 --> 01:16:42,770
I was there.

2235
01:16:45,850 --> 01:16:48,990
I'm taking two steps back every two seconds.

2236
01:16:49,090 --> 01:16:50,470
I was a journalist.

2237
01:16:50,730 --> 01:16:51,650
I'm here to record.

2238
01:16:51,650 --> 01:16:53,070
I mean, I...

2239
01:16:53,650 --> 01:16:55,210
I covered wars, you know.

2240
01:16:57,590 --> 01:16:58,370
What war?

2241
01:16:58,470 --> 01:16:59,350
What was your favorite war?

2242
01:16:59,650 --> 01:17:00,770
The war...

2243
01:17:00,770 --> 01:17:03,210
The Great Creeper War of 2024.

2244
01:17:06,630 --> 01:17:08,250
That was my favorite.

2245
01:17:08,790 --> 01:17:09,650
I think that's the temple.

2246
01:17:10,650 --> 01:17:11,810
A mini temple, right?

2247
01:17:12,350 --> 01:17:14,230
There's no such thing as a mini temple.

2248
01:17:14,430 --> 01:17:15,790
Wait, but you could dig under that.

2249
01:17:16,570 --> 01:17:17,670
Oh, that thing.

2250
01:17:18,010 --> 01:17:19,390
That is just a water fountain.

2251
01:17:19,390 --> 01:17:21,150
I think this is another temple.

2252
01:17:24,810 --> 01:17:25,410
Let's see.

2253
01:17:26,330 --> 01:17:27,270
You know what would be easier?

2254
01:17:27,370 --> 01:17:28,170
We just dig down.

2255
01:17:30,770 --> 01:17:32,670
Wait, what's wrong with this one?

2256
01:17:33,690 --> 01:17:34,470
I think that's the door.

2257
01:17:34,650 --> 01:17:36,150
I think you just spawned in incorrectly.

2258
01:17:36,590 --> 01:17:37,210
Dig down.

2259
01:17:37,390 --> 01:17:38,810
You want us to restart to succeed?

2260
01:17:40,670 --> 01:17:42,870
You're the one who suggested it!

2261
01:17:44,470 --> 01:17:46,330
You're the ones like, you know what's easier?

2262
01:17:46,550 --> 01:17:47,450
Digging down.

2263
01:17:48,510 --> 01:17:49,530
Why don't you go in?

2264
01:17:50,550 --> 01:17:51,010
What do you mean?

2265
01:17:51,090 --> 01:17:51,870
Do you want to do that?

2266
01:17:51,930 --> 01:17:53,410
There's nothing important there.

2267
01:17:53,670 --> 01:17:54,250
Yes, there is.

2268
01:17:54,310 --> 01:17:55,470
I'm going to watch you do it now.

2269
01:17:59,550 --> 01:18:00,710
Let's restart to succeed.

2270
01:18:00,830 --> 01:18:01,310
That's fine.

2271
01:18:01,650 --> 01:18:03,450
No, you have no confidence in yourself.

2272
01:18:03,450 --> 01:18:04,410
Let's restart to succeed.

2273
01:18:06,170 --> 01:18:08,330
You think I saw what you were doing?

2274
01:18:08,630 --> 01:18:10,310
You think I saw what you were doing?

2275
01:18:10,530 --> 01:18:11,410
What are you talking about?

2276
01:18:11,450 --> 01:18:12,690
I was doing the same exact thing.

2277
01:18:15,030 --> 01:18:16,650
I couldn't see what you were doing.

2278
01:18:16,650 --> 01:18:18,150
All I could see was this.

2279
01:18:18,970 --> 01:18:20,390
Oh, you said you could see.

2280
01:18:20,790 --> 01:18:22,890
I could see until you went down.

2281
01:18:23,030 --> 01:18:24,330
Come on, scaredy cat.

2282
01:18:24,550 --> 01:18:26,210
Come on, come on.

2283
01:18:26,410 --> 01:18:27,370
You know what?

2284
01:18:27,590 --> 01:18:29,690
This run was going on for too long anyway.

2285
01:18:32,250 --> 01:18:33,510
No, you got this.

2286
01:18:33,770 --> 01:18:35,010
Just dig stairs.

2287
01:18:35,150 --> 01:18:37,030
Dig stairs and make sure nothing touches the button.

2288
01:18:37,270 --> 01:18:38,010
That's all you got to do.

2289
01:18:38,590 --> 01:18:39,770
Yeah, yeah.

2290
01:18:40,010 --> 01:18:41,530
Are you scared?

2291
01:18:41,650 --> 01:18:42,450
No, I'm not scared.

2292
01:18:42,550 --> 01:18:45,010
I just think that I know I'm going to fuck it up.

2293
01:18:45,010 --> 01:18:46,970
There might be iron in there.

2294
01:18:51,210 --> 01:18:51,370
What are you doing?

2295
01:18:51,910 --> 01:18:52,850
I'm digging stairs.

2296
01:18:53,030 --> 01:18:54,210
What do you think I'm doing?

2297
01:18:54,590 --> 01:18:55,090
Oh, okay.

2298
01:18:55,350 --> 01:18:56,050
I couldn't tell.

2299
01:18:56,310 --> 01:18:57,530
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2300
01:18:57,590 --> 01:19:00,490
Because that was what my perspective was too.

2301
01:19:03,150 --> 01:19:04,490
Oh, you disappeared.

2302
01:19:04,890 --> 01:19:06,230
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2303
01:19:06,310 --> 01:19:09,250
Now you know how I felt when I...

2304
01:19:09,750 --> 01:19:11,230
I'm too far from the hole.

2305
01:19:11,930 --> 01:19:12,810
Should it be like here?

2306
01:19:13,350 --> 01:19:15,030
Yeah, you got to like...

2307
01:19:15,030 --> 01:19:16,610
Kind of be on the inside of it.

2308
01:19:16,610 --> 01:19:18,350
Kind of remember how my stairs were?

2309
01:19:18,950 --> 01:19:18,970
No.

2310
01:19:22,390 --> 01:19:23,430
Good guys.

2311
01:19:23,950 --> 01:19:25,230
This is what I have to deal with.

2312
01:19:27,650 --> 01:19:29,390
My gold pickaxe died.

2313
01:19:33,910 --> 01:19:35,770
Okay, come back up, Doki.

2314
01:19:35,990 --> 01:19:37,850
My gold pickaxe broke.

2315
01:19:38,350 --> 01:19:40,270
Let's just keep going.

2316
01:19:42,450 --> 01:19:44,390
How long did it last, Doki?

2317
01:19:44,390 --> 01:19:46,210
It lasted...

2318
01:19:46,210 --> 01:19:48,730
Like 10...

2319
01:19:48,730 --> 01:19:49,750
Yeah, I know.

2320
01:19:52,930 --> 01:19:53,310
Oh,

2321
01:20:01,090 --> 01:20:06,270
we found a village.

2322
01:20:06,470 --> 01:20:07,090
Okay, nice.

2323
01:20:08,530 --> 01:20:10,150
Oh, there's a cave next to it.

2324
01:20:10,190 --> 01:20:11,910
Yeah, I was going to say, it's right next to a cave.

2325
01:20:12,110 --> 01:20:13,570
Yeah, we could just...

2326
01:20:13,570 --> 01:20:15,270
Oh my god, we could.

2327
01:20:15,410 --> 01:20:16,750
If we can find some iron.

2328
01:20:18,410 --> 01:20:19,870
That's all we need, right?

2329
01:20:20,410 --> 01:20:22,010
That's all we need, yep.

2330
01:20:24,090 --> 01:20:25,350
These villages suck.

2331
01:20:25,370 --> 01:20:27,690
I know, these sand villages are so poor.

2332
01:20:28,410 --> 01:20:29,790
No wonder they live in the desert.

2333
01:20:30,310 --> 01:20:31,650
I got nothing here.

2334
01:20:31,750 --> 01:20:32,890
I just get bread and books.

2335
01:20:32,890 --> 01:20:36,010
It's like they're focused more on like survival and water.

2336
01:20:36,150 --> 01:20:36,710
I know.

2337
01:20:37,230 --> 01:20:38,210
Than actually having anything.

2338
01:20:42,570 --> 01:20:47,170
It's like they hate items, but they just, you know, only think about...

2339
01:20:47,170 --> 01:20:50,750
Like, you know, the bare necessities to win.

2340
01:20:51,210 --> 01:20:52,070
Yeah, exactly.

2341
01:20:52,350 --> 01:20:52,990
It's ridiculous.

2342
01:20:53,150 --> 01:20:54,130
Oh, I got a lot of bread though.

2343
01:20:54,590 --> 01:20:56,170
Yeah, there's a lot of bread in this village.

2344
01:20:56,470 --> 01:20:57,210
That's all they do.

2345
01:20:57,270 --> 01:20:58,170
They just want food.

2346
01:20:58,790 --> 01:20:59,910
Yeah, what is up with that?

2347
01:20:59,910 --> 01:21:01,410
What's wrong with them and food?

2348
01:21:01,550 --> 01:21:02,130
I don't understand.

2349
01:21:02,610 --> 01:21:03,390
I don't get it.

2350
01:21:03,490 --> 01:21:04,210
It's like they're losing...

2351
01:21:06,930 --> 01:21:08,190
Oh wait, there's sheep too.

2352
01:21:08,190 --> 01:21:10,330
Okay, there are two sheeps.

2353
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:14,200
There's two sheeps.

2354
01:21:16,840 --> 01:21:18,140
There's one sheep.

2355
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:19,720
Oh, I didn't think that way.

2356
01:21:19,780 --> 01:21:21,200
Oh wait, I have a saddle.

2357
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:22,960
Oh, you got it.

2358
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:23,280
Nice.

2359
01:21:23,960 --> 01:21:24,720
Where's the camel?

2360
01:21:26,580 --> 01:21:27,160
He's around.

2361
01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:27,660
There he is.

2362
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:28,240
Okay.

2363
01:21:30,620 --> 01:21:32,040
Can we both ride it?

2364
01:21:32,460 --> 01:21:33,320
Oh my god, we can.

2365
01:21:33,960 --> 01:21:34,760
We can.

2366
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:35,180
Wait.

2367
01:21:36,280 --> 01:21:37,480
Do we have to befriend the camel?

2368
01:21:37,480 --> 01:21:39,760
No, we can just ride it.

2369
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:41,460
Alright.

2370
01:21:42,540 --> 01:21:42,900
Oh yeah.

2371
01:21:43,220 --> 01:21:43,980
You're driving it.

2372
01:21:44,360 --> 01:21:47,560
Wait, how do we change POV again?

2373
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:48,620
F5.

2374
01:21:50,260 --> 01:21:51,480
Oh my god, look at us.

2375
01:21:52,580 --> 01:21:53,000
Alright.

2376
01:21:53,300 --> 01:21:55,480
We don't need a water bucket.

2377
01:21:55,620 --> 01:21:57,740
We can just use a boat and drop into the cave.

2378
01:21:57,740 --> 01:21:58,820
Oh, that's true.

2379
01:21:59,000 --> 01:21:59,740
But what about a camel?

2380
01:22:01,560 --> 01:22:02,540
He would die.

2381
01:22:02,760 --> 01:22:04,260
Wait, jump down the cave with a camel.

2382
01:22:04,360 --> 01:22:05,060
Will we die with him?

2383
01:22:05,660 --> 01:22:06,400
Okay, time.

2384
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:07,940
This is a science experiment, everybody.

2385
01:22:08,240 --> 01:22:09,500
Does he act like a boat?

2386
01:22:09,980 --> 01:22:10,900
Does he act like a boat?

2387
01:22:12,460 --> 01:22:14,220
This is a really important question, everybody.

2388
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:16,360
This is a really important question.

2389
01:22:16,860 --> 01:22:18,360
This is really important.

2390
01:22:20,700 --> 01:22:22,200
Don't land on the lava.

2391
01:22:22,660 --> 01:22:26,360
Do not land on the lava.

2392
01:22:28,920 --> 01:22:31,220
You guys, all I see is 07s.

2393
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:33,380
I'm not seeing anyone telling me an answer.

2394
01:22:33,380 --> 01:22:34,840
Yeah, we need to know.

2395
01:22:35,240 --> 01:22:36,960
Is the camel like a boat?

2396
01:22:39,480 --> 01:22:42,480
What if we jump down with a camel?

2397
01:22:42,720 --> 01:22:45,880
And we do MLG gaming and we get off the camel before it hits?

2398
01:22:46,220 --> 01:22:47,540
Do we get the same fault?

2399
01:22:47,780 --> 01:22:48,920
Does physics work?

2400
01:22:50,600 --> 01:22:51,820
Camel is not a boat.

2401
01:22:52,760 --> 01:22:54,060
Camel is not boat.

2402
01:22:56,540 --> 01:22:59,260
You know we would've done it if they didn't say anything.

2403
01:22:59,260 --> 01:22:59,820
Whoa!

2404
01:23:01,260 --> 01:23:04,340
They all wanted to watch the science experiment.

2405
01:23:04,860 --> 01:23:10,760
They were all curious about the science experiment we're doing.

2406
01:23:13,940 --> 01:23:16,620
This camel is so fucking slow.

2407
01:23:16,760 --> 01:23:19,360
Why did we waste our saddle on this camel?

2408
01:23:21,040 --> 01:23:22,720
Because we wouldn't ever get a...

2409
01:23:22,720 --> 01:23:24,900
Let's be honest, we would never get a...

2410
01:23:24,900 --> 01:23:25,960
Oh wait, I can jump.

2411
01:23:25,960 --> 01:23:26,460
They're like a horse.

2412
01:23:26,840 --> 01:23:28,800
Yeah, they're pretty nifty.

2413
01:23:29,100 --> 01:23:30,700
Oh my god, I can jump.

2414
01:23:31,020 --> 01:23:33,460
What's the point of having camels in Minecraft?

2415
01:23:34,840 --> 01:23:36,360
They're cute, I think.

2416
01:23:36,680 --> 01:23:37,680
Do they do anything?

2417
01:23:39,800 --> 01:23:41,100
Oh, they can swim.

2418
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:42,180
They cannot swim.

2419
01:23:43,500 --> 01:23:44,180
No, they cannot.

2420
01:23:44,440 --> 01:23:45,880
The camel was gonna drown.

2421
01:23:46,540 --> 01:23:48,300
I'm going over to this nether portal.

2422
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:50,220
I'll be back.

2423
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:51,600
I'm taking the camel with me.

2424
01:23:52,340 --> 01:23:53,740
To the nether portal?

2425
01:23:54,100 --> 01:23:54,540
Yeah.

2426
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:56,900
The camel keeps running away.

2427
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:00,840
He doesn't want to go.

2428
01:24:00,980 --> 01:24:01,620
He doesn't want to go.

2429
01:24:02,940 --> 01:24:04,140
I'm heading over.

2430
01:24:05,580 --> 01:24:06,620
Here I am.

2431
01:24:06,760 --> 01:24:08,140
I thought we were trying to find a mountain.

2432
01:24:09,240 --> 01:24:10,480
Yeah, we need to find one.

2433
01:24:10,640 --> 01:24:11,900
We just need to find iron.

2434
01:24:13,080 --> 01:24:14,280
We might as well go this way.

2435
01:24:14,540 --> 01:24:16,180
Follow me and the camel.

2436
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:17,860
Hold on, I'm making bread.

2437
01:24:17,860 --> 01:24:19,280
I have so much bread.

2438
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:20,300
Why do you need more bread?

2439
01:24:21,240 --> 01:24:22,580
I just want to make bread.

2440
01:24:22,860 --> 01:24:24,100
I'm running out of space.

2441
01:24:24,420 --> 01:24:25,320
Wait, don't push me.

2442
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:25,780
Don't push me.

2443
01:24:26,020 --> 01:24:28,160
Don't push me.

2444
01:24:32,780 --> 01:24:34,720
I have all the power.

2445
01:24:37,020 --> 01:24:37,900
Look at this.

2446
01:24:38,660 --> 01:24:39,740
What is that?

2447
01:24:40,460 --> 01:24:41,900
I got golden armor now.

2448
01:24:42,180 --> 01:24:43,380
I thought you said gold sucks.

2449
01:24:43,380 --> 01:24:45,360
It does, but it's all I got.

2450
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,160
Let's go onward.

2451
01:24:48,320 --> 01:24:49,560
You know you can run.

2452
01:24:49,820 --> 01:24:51,400
Just run with the camel.

2453
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:52,140
Okay, you do it.

2454
01:24:53,740 --> 01:24:55,520
Come on, here we go.

2455
01:24:55,880 --> 01:24:56,680
That's running?

2456
01:24:57,560 --> 01:24:59,480
Actually, he's pretty fast for a camel.

2457
01:24:59,940 --> 01:25:00,820
That's running?

2458
01:25:02,900 --> 01:25:04,080
Wait, he can't swim.

2459
01:25:04,100 --> 01:25:04,560
No, he can.

2460
01:25:05,120 --> 01:25:05,840
Just walk.

2461
01:25:07,160 --> 01:25:09,060
And then we just climb back on.

2462
01:25:10,080 --> 01:25:11,400
What do you mean climb back on?

2463
01:25:11,400 --> 01:25:12,640
You climb back on.

2464
01:25:12,700 --> 01:25:13,760
Oh my god.

2465
01:25:14,040 --> 01:25:16,180
Just keep climbing back on.

2466
01:25:16,700 --> 01:25:17,420
Keep going.

2467
01:25:17,580 --> 01:25:21,580
We're almost there.

2468
01:25:21,640 --> 01:25:22,820
Okay, we need to sleep.

2469
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:24,560
Time to sleep.

2470
01:25:24,720 --> 01:25:25,360
Good night everybody.

2471
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:27,020
Why is the camel walking back?

2472
01:25:28,020 --> 01:25:29,080
He'll be fine.

2473
01:25:29,220 --> 01:25:30,220
He's in the water.

2474
01:25:32,260 --> 01:25:34,640
That's right, you can never leave camel.

2475
01:25:37,380 --> 01:25:39,820
You're part of our gang now.

2476
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:41,800
That's a mountain.

2477
01:25:42,540 --> 01:25:43,980
We're still in the desert.

2478
01:25:45,080 --> 01:25:48,020
We might find some though, let's go check.

2479
01:25:48,600 --> 01:25:49,180
In the desert?

2480
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:51,580
Maybe, I don't know.

2481
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:53,220
Oh my god.

2482
01:25:54,040 --> 01:25:57,580
We're never gonna leave this god forsaken land.

2483
01:26:00,660 --> 01:26:02,160
There's no iron here.

2484
01:26:02,460 --> 01:26:03,960
There isn't, it's just sand.

2485
01:26:04,760 --> 01:26:07,220
I see, I saw some other stuff in there.

2486
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:08,620
No you didn't, it's just sand.

2487
01:26:08,620 --> 01:26:09,620
Come here, come here.

2488
01:26:10,200 --> 01:26:12,340
I saw, I really did.

2489
01:26:12,420 --> 01:26:15,000
No you didn't, you're just seeing things.

2490
01:26:15,100 --> 01:26:15,780
I don't see it.

2491
01:26:15,900 --> 01:26:16,980
You gotta take your meds again.

2492
01:26:17,080 --> 01:26:18,200
You haven't taken your meds.

2493
01:26:21,320 --> 01:26:22,620
Get over here.

2494
01:26:22,640 --> 01:26:23,900
We can look at the side of this mountain.

2495
01:26:24,220 --> 01:26:26,600
It's not even a mountain, it's just sand.

2496
01:26:27,040 --> 01:26:28,520
It's a car, I saw a car.

2497
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:30,680
We gotta get out of sand land.

2498
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:31,760
Okay, okay.

2499
01:26:31,860 --> 01:26:33,540
Well if you would slow down.

2500
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:36,300
Oh my god, you're literally faster than this camel.

2501
01:26:36,300 --> 01:26:38,320
You're literally...

2502
01:26:38,320 --> 01:26:39,780
Wait I wonder, you should run.

2503
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:41,540
Run as the camel and see if I can catch up.

2504
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:42,620
Wait, how do I run?

2505
01:26:42,720 --> 01:26:43,900
Do I just press space bar?

2506
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:46,200
No, it's...

2507
01:26:46,200 --> 01:26:47,800
Like, you're running.

2508
01:26:48,500 --> 01:26:49,820
Like, you're normal running.

2509
01:26:51,380 --> 01:26:52,160
No, that's shift.

2510
01:26:52,220 --> 01:26:52,800
Why can't you run?

2511
01:26:53,380 --> 01:26:53,940
Yeah, shift.

2512
01:26:54,700 --> 01:26:56,140
No, shift is crouch.

2513
01:26:57,020 --> 01:26:58,720
Oh, no I have my keybinds different.

2514
01:26:58,860 --> 01:27:01,360
Oh my god, he's sitting down for me.

2515
01:27:02,540 --> 01:27:03,460
He's just surfing.

2516
01:27:03,460 --> 01:27:05,760
You know, he's like surfing on the land.

2517
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:07,160
Wait, what?

2518
01:27:07,380 --> 01:27:08,500
I'm on top of him.

2519
01:27:09,080 --> 01:27:13,900
He's like sitting down while surfing on the land right now.

2520
01:27:14,140 --> 01:27:14,700
What?

2521
01:27:17,100 --> 01:27:18,620
Oh my god, it's like we're surfing.

2522
01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:20,820
What are you talking about?

2523
01:27:20,860 --> 01:27:21,740
I think you're lagging.

2524
01:27:23,060 --> 01:27:25,620
No, we're literally surfing.

2525
01:27:25,900 --> 01:27:26,780
We're sand surfing.

2526
01:27:29,940 --> 01:27:32,420
What are you talking about?

2527
01:27:32,420 --> 01:27:35,480
Okay, speaking of someone taking meds...

2528
01:27:35,480 --> 01:27:37,420
No, I think I accidentally ate something wrong.

2529
01:27:39,340 --> 01:27:42,420
I might have ate some of the wild mushrooms up here.

2530
01:27:43,900 --> 01:27:46,480
Oh, you ate the beef, but it wasn't cooked.

2531
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:49,840
You have like probably a cow brain disease or something.

2532
01:27:50,020 --> 01:27:51,200
Oh, there's coal up there.

2533
01:27:52,900 --> 01:27:53,640
We don't need coal.

2534
01:27:54,180 --> 01:27:54,960
Yes, we do.

2535
01:27:55,480 --> 01:27:56,380
We don't need it.

2536
01:27:56,680 --> 01:27:57,640
Yes, we do.

2537
01:27:57,640 --> 01:27:58,960
We don't need it.

2538
01:27:58,960 --> 01:27:59,920
I'm panning out.

2539
01:28:00,980 --> 01:28:01,500
Why?

2540
01:28:01,660 --> 01:28:02,500
Don't leave me.

2541
01:28:02,600 --> 01:28:03,480
We need the coal.

2542
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:04,800
I'm panning out.

2543
01:28:04,960 --> 01:28:05,980
It's a lot of coal.

2544
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:08,180
Oh, it was the rotten meat.

2545
01:28:08,500 --> 01:28:10,140
Oh no.

2546
01:28:11,060 --> 01:28:11,960
Get back here.

2547
01:28:14,260 --> 01:28:15,900
When's the last time you hydrated?

2548
01:28:16,760 --> 01:28:18,080
Oh, that's a good question.

2549
01:28:19,380 --> 01:28:21,220
Look at her go in the water.

2550
01:28:21,500 --> 01:28:22,160
Look at her go.

2551
01:28:22,340 --> 01:28:24,720
I'm gonna drink the water in this ocean.

2552
01:28:24,720 --> 01:28:26,140
I'm gonna drink all the salt.

2553
01:28:26,280 --> 01:28:26,960
All the salt water.

2554
01:28:28,120 --> 01:28:29,900
You can go crazy with that, you know.

2555
01:28:30,380 --> 01:28:30,820
I know.

2556
01:28:31,780 --> 01:28:33,300
Yeah, sure.

2557
01:28:34,860 --> 01:28:36,100
Yeah, we should do that off the collab.

2558
01:28:37,440 --> 01:28:38,760
Off the collab.

2559
01:28:40,700 --> 01:28:42,060
I love it.

2560
01:28:42,060 --> 01:28:43,380
Until we go crazy.

2561
01:28:45,120 --> 01:28:46,860
Viewer's discretion is advised.

2562
01:28:48,020 --> 01:28:50,000
Don't try this at home.

2563
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:50,520
Don't try this at home.

2564
01:28:52,640 --> 01:28:53,120
Wait.

2565
01:28:53,440 --> 01:28:54,680
How do I make this?

2566
01:28:56,140 --> 01:28:58,180
Wait, I think we're getting out of the sand land.

2567
01:29:00,740 --> 01:29:02,160
Oh, I can only make one.

2568
01:29:02,300 --> 01:29:04,760
Why is there more sand in front of me?

2569
01:29:09,590 --> 01:29:11,250
How is there more sand?

2570
01:29:15,490 --> 01:29:16,550
Oh my god.

2571
01:29:16,990 --> 01:29:18,490
By the way, I went forward.

2572
01:29:19,310 --> 01:29:19,970
Yeah, I know.

2573
01:29:20,050 --> 01:29:20,850
I saw where you went.

2574
01:29:20,850 --> 01:29:21,510
Okay.

2575
01:29:21,710 --> 01:29:24,170
Yeah, I'm just gonna keep going forward until the sand stops.

2576
01:29:24,310 --> 01:29:27,710
You could wait like two seconds for me to catch up.

2577
01:29:29,130 --> 01:29:33,330
I'm pretty sure the camel is slower than actually walking.

2578
01:29:35,310 --> 01:29:36,230
It might be.

2579
01:29:36,730 --> 01:29:37,630
Where are you?

2580
01:29:37,850 --> 01:29:38,730
Did you go in the water?

2581
01:29:39,450 --> 01:29:40,490
I crossed the ocean.

2582
01:29:41,330 --> 01:29:42,510
Wait, how did you do that?

2583
01:29:42,890 --> 01:29:43,370
I don't know.

2584
01:29:43,910 --> 01:29:44,650
Yeah, I just keep walking.

2585
01:29:44,650 --> 01:29:45,930
I told you the strat.

2586
01:29:46,030 --> 01:29:47,630
We keep walking until...

2587
01:29:47,630 --> 01:29:48,130
I'm here.

2588
01:29:48,310 --> 01:29:48,530
Okay.

2589
01:29:49,690 --> 01:29:50,590
What do you mean you're here?

2590
01:29:50,990 --> 01:29:52,210
I crossed another area.

2591
01:29:53,070 --> 01:29:55,150
Wait, I don't think you know where I am.

2592
01:29:56,190 --> 01:29:57,270
Am I going the right way, guys?

2593
01:29:59,470 --> 01:30:00,650
I am at...

2594
01:30:04,090 --> 01:30:05,530
195 and counting.

2595
01:30:06,610 --> 01:30:07,490
Negative 195.

2596
01:30:08,370 --> 01:30:09,670
Yeah, I'm going up.

2597
01:30:09,770 --> 01:30:10,210
I'm going up.

2598
01:30:10,710 --> 01:30:12,790
Oh, did you hit a jungle?

2599
01:30:12,790 --> 01:30:14,310
Wait, what?

2600
01:30:15,590 --> 01:30:16,670
There's a jungle?

2601
01:30:17,690 --> 01:30:19,370
Oh, you went the wrong way.

2602
01:30:19,570 --> 01:30:21,010
No, I'm going towards 195.

2603
01:30:21,910 --> 01:30:23,110
I'm at negative 195.

2604
01:30:24,310 --> 01:30:25,970
You're at the wrong way.

2605
01:30:26,030 --> 01:30:27,610
There is no jungle here.

2606
01:30:28,350 --> 01:30:30,370
Why am I always finding jungles?

2607
01:30:31,830 --> 01:30:33,950
I'm at negative 20...

2608
01:30:33,950 --> 01:30:34,590
20...

2609
01:30:36,430 --> 01:30:37,030
04350.

2610
01:30:37,610 --> 01:30:40,130
Okay, but you know what happens when someone is lost?

2611
01:30:40,210 --> 01:30:41,690
You literally stop moving, okay?

2612
01:30:42,790 --> 01:30:44,290
Why don't you ever stop moving?

2613
01:30:44,350 --> 01:30:46,270
You're the one that's lost, not me.

2614
01:30:46,930 --> 01:30:48,010
Are you still on the camera?

2615
01:30:48,490 --> 01:30:48,810
Yeah.

2616
01:30:49,830 --> 01:30:52,030
I've never stopped being on the camera.

2617
01:30:52,350 --> 01:30:55,270
What's your Z position?

2618
01:30:55,890 --> 01:30:56,370
350.

2619
01:30:58,410 --> 01:30:58,890
321.

2620
01:30:59,890 --> 01:31:00,090
Okay.

2621
01:31:01,890 --> 01:31:02,850
Stop laughing!

2622
01:31:06,690 --> 01:31:08,270
I have to go in like a diagonal.

2623
01:31:08,490 --> 01:31:09,290
Oh my god!

2624
01:31:09,330 --> 01:31:10,690
Okay, I'm gonna make a peepee tower.

2625
01:31:10,690 --> 01:31:12,010
I'm gonna do it.

2626
01:31:12,290 --> 01:31:13,630
Okay, make a peepee tower.

2627
01:31:13,870 --> 01:31:14,170
Do it.

2628
01:31:14,250 --> 01:31:15,470
No, that's a waste of my resources.

2629
01:31:15,930 --> 01:31:18,290
You can destroy the peepee tower.

2630
01:31:18,710 --> 01:31:19,970
Once you make something.

2631
01:31:21,130 --> 01:31:22,790
Okay, I made the peepee tower.

2632
01:31:22,890 --> 01:31:24,450
What if I fall over the peepee tower?

2633
01:31:25,490 --> 01:31:26,050
Hold on.

2634
01:31:26,470 --> 01:31:27,770
I'll find you first.

2635
01:31:27,790 --> 01:31:28,990
I made a peepee tower.

2636
01:31:29,070 --> 01:31:29,790
Where are you?

2637
01:31:30,170 --> 01:31:30,910
What's your coordinate?

2638
01:31:31,510 --> 01:31:32,830
I didn't move.

2639
01:31:34,110 --> 01:31:36,210
Tell me your coordinate.

2640
01:31:36,210 --> 01:31:38,450
Your chat can retell you the coordinates.

2641
01:31:41,250 --> 01:31:42,370
Chat, what's the coordinates?

2642
01:31:47,110 --> 01:31:48,670
What's the coordinates now?

2643
01:31:49,110 --> 01:31:50,130
Oh, your chat was listening.

2644
01:31:50,990 --> 01:31:52,690
My chat says no, we cannot.

2645
01:31:52,890 --> 01:31:53,770
They're not helping me.

2646
01:31:56,410 --> 01:31:56,890
Minus...

2647
01:31:58,370 --> 01:31:58,850
2003...

2648
01:31:58,850 --> 01:32:00,910
and 327.

2649
01:32:02,810 --> 01:32:03,290
327?

2650
01:32:03,390 --> 01:32:03,770
Oh, shoot.

2651
01:32:03,870 --> 01:32:04,070
Okay.

2652
01:32:04,710 --> 01:32:06,190
Alright, I'm on my way.

2653
01:32:06,950 --> 01:32:07,870
Which side are you on?

2654
01:32:07,950 --> 01:32:08,570
Left or right?

2655
01:32:08,570 --> 01:32:10,950
I'm coming probably...

2656
01:32:10,950 --> 01:32:12,550
Well, probably from your left.

2657
01:32:12,750 --> 01:32:13,170
Okay.

2658
01:32:13,910 --> 01:32:15,070
I'm looking left.

2659
01:32:15,390 --> 01:32:16,790
I'm looking for the peepee tower.

2660
01:32:19,010 --> 01:32:20,250
I'm looking left.

2661
01:32:20,410 --> 01:32:24,230
Thank god these birds aren't real so they don't swoop in and fucking stab me.

2662
01:32:24,510 --> 01:32:25,950
What birds are you talking about?

2663
01:32:25,950 --> 01:32:27,590
I have birds in my resource packs.

2664
01:32:28,310 --> 01:32:29,150
Oh, what?

2665
01:32:32,070 --> 01:32:33,430
What are you playing?

2666
01:32:33,730 --> 01:32:35,270
I gotta eat.

2667
01:32:36,410 --> 01:32:37,910
What do you see around you?

2668
01:32:37,990 --> 01:32:38,530
Is it all sand?

2669
01:32:38,530 --> 01:32:39,230
I see birds.

2670
01:32:41,490 --> 01:32:42,810
It's all sand.

2671
01:32:43,270 --> 01:32:44,650
It's all sand.

2672
01:32:45,450 --> 01:32:46,550
You don't see any trees?

2673
01:32:46,870 --> 01:32:48,470
No, I see cactuses.

2674
01:32:49,630 --> 01:32:51,490
Where the fuck did you go?

2675
01:32:52,470 --> 01:32:53,470
Wait, you're at 20...

2676
01:32:53,810 --> 01:32:54,890
You're at 2000 what?

2677
01:32:55,210 --> 01:32:57,630
Negative 2003...

2678
01:32:58,730 --> 01:32:59,210
327.

2679
01:33:00,050 --> 01:33:00,610
Oh, shoot.

2680
01:33:01,070 --> 01:33:02,610
I'm not even at 2300.

2681
01:33:09,220 --> 01:33:09,580
Okay.

2682
01:33:10,220 --> 01:33:11,480
I see trees to my right.

2683
01:33:11,620 --> 01:33:12,680
Wait, are you still in the forest?

2684
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:15,360
No.

2685
01:33:15,700 --> 01:33:16,660
What was the other one?

2686
01:33:17,800 --> 01:33:18,160
327.

2687
01:33:18,180 --> 01:33:19,020
I'm gonna go to the forest.

2688
01:33:19,920 --> 01:33:21,020
I went the wrong way.

2689
01:33:21,460 --> 01:33:23,160
I got rid of the peepee tower.

2690
01:33:23,380 --> 01:33:23,960
You're on your own.

2691
01:33:25,180 --> 01:33:26,200
I'm going to the forest.

2692
01:33:26,600 --> 01:33:27,400
I'll meet you there.

2693
01:33:27,400 --> 01:33:28,840
Wait, oh, the jungle?

2694
01:33:29,820 --> 01:33:31,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2695
01:33:34,360 --> 01:33:36,140
The jungle...

2696
01:33:36,140 --> 01:33:38,460
The mighty jungle...

2697
01:33:38,460 --> 01:33:40,680
The lion sleeps at night...

2698
01:33:42,260 --> 01:33:43,140
All the

2699
01:33:46,520 --> 01:33:48,800
way...

2700
01:33:48,800 --> 01:33:55,480
All the way...

2701
01:33:55,480 --> 01:33:56,640
All the way...

2702
01:33:56,640 --> 01:33:56,820
All the way...

2703
01:33:56,820 --> 01:33:57,040
All the way...

2704
01:33:57,040 --> 01:33:58,760
We're not okay anymore.

2705
01:33:59,840 --> 01:34:02,020
It hasn't even been two hours.

2706
01:34:02,600 --> 01:34:04,880
We've made zero progress.

2707
01:34:04,880 --> 01:34:06,680
We still don't have iron!

2708
01:34:07,440 --> 01:34:08,680
Yeah, we don't have any iron.

2709
01:34:08,680 --> 01:34:12,340
I'm at 460, negative 2077 now.

2710
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:14,120
460?

2711
01:34:14,580 --> 01:34:16,700
Yeah, negative 20...

2712
01:34:17,260 --> 01:34:18,300
Oh, I see you!

2713
01:34:18,920 --> 01:34:20,020
Wait, where are you?

2714
01:34:20,460 --> 01:34:21,000
I'm swimming.

2715
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:21,720
Hold on.

2716
01:34:22,480 --> 01:34:23,420
Oh, I see you.

2717
01:34:23,420 --> 01:34:24,680
I'm gonna go to this other side anyway.

2718
01:34:25,360 --> 01:34:25,760
Okay.

2719
01:34:26,300 --> 01:34:27,140
Go back.

2720
01:34:28,600 --> 01:34:29,380
Keep going.

2721
01:34:29,960 --> 01:34:32,020
This camel is so fucking slow!

2722
01:34:32,680 --> 01:34:33,520
Okay, I'm going.

2723
01:34:33,820 --> 01:34:34,500
Oh my god.

2724
01:34:34,780 --> 01:34:36,080
Get over here, camel.

2725
01:34:36,420 --> 01:34:37,080
I'm going ahead.

2726
01:34:37,540 --> 01:34:38,280
Alright, fuck this.

2727
01:34:38,420 --> 01:34:39,220
We're leaving this camel.

2728
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:40,920
We're leaving him.

2729
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:42,120
I'm taking my saddle back.

2730
01:34:42,380 --> 01:34:43,800
You can take your saddle back?

2731
01:34:44,340 --> 01:34:45,800
He's not in his biome.

2732
01:34:45,920 --> 01:34:46,600
He's gonna die.

2733
01:34:48,740 --> 01:34:52,240
I took him to the forest and now he's not in the sand anymore.

2734
01:34:52,440 --> 01:34:52,900
He's gonna die!

2735
01:34:53,820 --> 01:34:56,120
Oh my god, it's gonna be too cold.

2736
01:34:56,460 --> 01:34:57,840
It's like...

2737
01:34:57,840 --> 01:34:59,340
It's gonna be like the winter nights.

2738
01:35:02,540 --> 01:35:03,460
He deserved it.

2739
01:35:03,480 --> 01:35:04,280
He should've been faster.

2740
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:06,100
He should've been faster.

2741
01:35:06,220 --> 01:35:07,240
He was pretty fast.

2742
01:35:07,360 --> 01:35:08,020
No, he wasn't.

2743
01:35:08,100 --> 01:35:10,060
We're literally traveling faster than him.

2744
01:35:10,440 --> 01:35:11,700
You just don't know how to run.

2745
01:35:12,820 --> 01:35:13,940
I know how to run with him.

2746
01:35:14,200 --> 01:35:15,320
Go back.

2747
01:35:15,360 --> 01:35:15,620
Go back.

2748
01:35:15,660 --> 01:35:16,220
Grab the camel.

2749
01:35:16,460 --> 01:35:17,160
I'll give you the saddle.

2750
01:35:17,520 --> 01:35:18,880
Oh, now.

2751
01:35:19,740 --> 01:35:21,600
Oh, you're just gonna leave him like Mario?

2752
01:35:21,860 --> 01:35:22,600
To his Yoshi?

2753
01:35:23,520 --> 01:35:24,660
You're just like...

2754
01:35:26,380 --> 01:35:28,500
You're the one who rode him all the way here.

2755
01:35:28,500 --> 01:35:32,780
If anything, he thought that you were his mother and you're abandoning him now.

2756
01:35:33,680 --> 01:35:35,700
Yeah, it's because he had daddy issues.

2757
01:35:37,180 --> 01:35:38,300
You're the mother!

2758
01:35:39,500 --> 01:35:41,300
You literally said I was the mother!

2759
01:35:41,820 --> 01:35:43,860
You literally said I was the mother!

2760
01:35:44,200 --> 01:35:44,900
Okay, okay.

2761
01:35:44,940 --> 01:35:45,600
Where are you?

2762
01:35:46,760 --> 01:35:47,440
Oh, I'm right here.

2763
01:35:47,900 --> 01:35:51,560
Another thing we can do is we can find a...

2764
01:35:51,560 --> 01:35:52,360
A pirate.

2765
01:35:52,540 --> 01:35:53,100
A sunken ship.

2766
01:35:53,460 --> 01:35:54,860
And then...

2767
01:35:54,860 --> 01:35:55,360
We should sleep.

2768
01:35:56,140 --> 01:35:56,820
Oh, yeah.

2769
01:35:57,480 --> 01:35:58,740
We should sleep.

2770
01:36:00,200 --> 01:36:00,640
Alright.

2771
01:36:01,060 --> 01:36:02,440
I'm gonna get rid of this bed.

2772
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:04,620
Alright, yeah.

2773
01:36:04,660 --> 01:36:05,280
We just need one bed.

2774
01:36:05,320 --> 01:36:06,260
It doesn't matter anyway.

2775
01:36:06,560 --> 01:36:08,220
Because we can't respawn.

2776
01:36:09,040 --> 01:36:09,400
Yeah.

2777
01:36:09,880 --> 01:36:14,140
Alright, I'm ready.

2778
01:36:14,680 --> 01:36:17,120
So, let's be on the lookout for sunken ships.

2779
01:36:17,260 --> 01:36:19,200
And we can find iron and stuff in there.

2780
01:36:19,300 --> 01:36:20,720
Why don't we just find a mountain?

2781
01:36:22,200 --> 01:36:23,900
I feel like a mountain would be easier.

2782
01:36:25,100 --> 01:36:25,500
Okay.

2783
01:36:25,880 --> 01:36:27,860
Well, we can use the boat to get to the mountain.

2784
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:29,560
Can we get in the water too for iron?

2785
01:36:30,760 --> 01:36:31,500
I don't think...

2786
01:36:31,500 --> 01:36:33,920
I feel like a ship, we can see it easily.

2787
01:36:33,980 --> 01:36:34,700
Just go forward.

2788
01:36:34,840 --> 01:36:35,380
Straight forward.

2789
01:36:35,820 --> 01:36:36,080
Okay.

2790
01:36:36,640 --> 01:36:37,320
Forward ho!

2791
01:36:38,020 --> 01:36:38,660
We'll find...

2792
01:36:38,660 --> 01:36:40,720
We'll clearly find a mountain, right?

2793
01:36:41,400 --> 01:36:43,240
Okay, ship or mountain first.

2794
01:36:43,300 --> 01:36:44,220
Which do you think will come?

2795
01:36:44,420 --> 01:36:45,140
I think a mountain.

2796
01:36:45,900 --> 01:36:46,300
Okay.

2797
01:36:49,740 --> 01:36:50,400
I'm ready.

2798
01:36:50,400 --> 01:36:51,880
This is peaceful.

2799
01:36:52,320 --> 01:36:52,620
Yeah.

2800
01:36:53,100 --> 01:36:53,860
You know what?

2801
01:36:54,040 --> 01:36:55,580
Maybe we should work together more often.

2802
01:36:56,560 --> 01:36:58,400
Somebody here keeps, you know...

2803
01:36:59,200 --> 01:37:00,440
Doing it's own thing.

2804
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:02,820
I think...

2805
01:37:02,820 --> 01:37:04,780
Honestly, it's been...

2806
01:37:04,780 --> 01:37:06,420
Our chats that are pitting us against each other.

2807
01:37:06,420 --> 01:37:07,440
That's so true.

2808
01:37:07,960 --> 01:37:10,340
Especially like...

2809
01:37:10,340 --> 01:37:11,080
Dragoons.

2810
01:37:11,340 --> 01:37:11,860
Wow!

2811
01:37:13,060 --> 01:37:13,740
Wow!

2812
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:19,360
Especially...

2813
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:20,560
I don't wanna name names.

2814
01:37:21,420 --> 01:37:23,360
I know a couple of wisps.

2815
01:37:23,900 --> 01:37:25,820
That were doing some things too.

2816
01:37:26,720 --> 01:37:26,940
Oh yeah.

2817
01:37:27,200 --> 01:37:28,440
Weren't your wisps being like...

2818
01:37:28,440 --> 01:37:30,020
I'm not gonna tell you where the coordinates are.

2819
01:37:30,240 --> 01:37:32,840
My dragoons would tell me the coordinates if I asked them.

2820
01:37:34,900 --> 01:37:35,840
Actually, they probably...

2821
01:37:35,840 --> 01:37:36,940
I think wisps hate me.

2822
01:37:39,560 --> 01:37:40,480
Suckin' ship!

2823
01:37:40,480 --> 01:37:40,700
What?

2824
01:37:43,120 --> 01:37:43,920
Wait here.

2825
01:37:46,260 --> 01:37:47,300
Is that a suckin' ship?

2826
01:37:48,040 --> 01:37:50,000
Yeah, but it's not very big.

2827
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:51,100
So you don't need to come in.

2828
01:37:52,340 --> 01:37:54,340
But you just wanna keep all the iron to yourself.

2829
01:37:54,900 --> 01:37:55,960
There is no iron.

2830
01:37:56,060 --> 01:37:56,900
You just wanna keep all the iron.

2831
01:37:57,160 --> 01:37:59,360
You literally said, suckin' ships have iron.

2832
01:37:59,900 --> 01:38:01,040
Not always, sometimes.

2833
01:38:01,180 --> 01:38:02,080
Oh my God.

2834
01:38:02,740 --> 01:38:03,520
Get in here.

2835
01:38:05,100 --> 01:38:05,880
Get in here.

2836
01:38:05,880 --> 01:38:06,540
Get on your new shoes.

2837
01:38:07,140 --> 01:38:09,620
Get on your new shoes.

2838
01:38:10,040 --> 01:38:12,860
Alright, you have to keep on lookout of the suckin' ships.

2839
01:38:12,920 --> 01:38:13,460
I'm not looking.

2840
01:38:13,900 --> 01:38:15,600
Okay, I'm on the lookout.

2841
01:38:16,540 --> 01:38:18,200
Oh hey, there's a drown area here.

2842
01:38:18,720 --> 01:38:19,520
Oh yeah.

2843
01:38:20,060 --> 01:38:22,340
Wait, do those areas have...

2844
01:38:22,340 --> 01:38:23,680
Yeah, do they have like stuff?

2845
01:38:24,540 --> 01:38:26,060
That's like a hidden temple thing.

2846
01:38:27,060 --> 01:38:27,800
Those are...

2847
01:38:27,800 --> 01:38:29,060
Oh, there's a drown there though.

2848
01:38:29,320 --> 01:38:30,700
I don't think we have enough...

2849
01:38:30,700 --> 01:38:33,300
We wouldn't be able to stay under the water for long enough.

2850
01:38:33,300 --> 01:38:34,020
It's not worth it.

2851
01:38:34,080 --> 01:38:34,540
Oh, okay.

2852
01:38:35,560 --> 01:38:37,360
You have to like dig for the chest.

2853
01:38:38,220 --> 01:38:40,440
Oh, I see.

2854
01:38:40,840 --> 01:38:42,900
It's like treasure hunting and stuff.

2855
01:38:43,180 --> 01:38:44,860
I wanna give them just dig down.

2856
01:38:45,800 --> 01:38:46,840
We could do that.

2857
01:38:47,240 --> 01:38:48,240
I feel like...

2858
01:38:48,240 --> 01:38:49,080
Oh hey, there's turtles.

2859
01:38:50,360 --> 01:38:51,640
Look at the baby turtles!

2860
01:38:51,660 --> 01:38:54,440
Oh my God, that's so cute!

2861
01:38:54,460 --> 01:38:56,020
Oh my God, he's shambling.

2862
01:38:57,060 --> 01:38:59,800
Oh my God, a seagull's gonna come in and fucking eat him.

2863
01:39:00,420 --> 01:39:00,920
Oh no.

2864
01:39:03,300 --> 01:39:04,100
Yeah, that's true.

2865
01:39:04,320 --> 01:39:05,900
We can't touch him, it's mother nature.

2866
01:39:06,340 --> 01:39:07,920
Yeah, we can't touch him.

2867
01:39:08,080 --> 01:39:09,620
It's like those like...

2868
01:39:09,620 --> 01:39:12,840
nature documentaries who like...

2869
01:39:12,840 --> 01:39:14,380
let things happen...

2870
01:39:14,380 --> 01:39:15,740
despite what happens.

2871
01:39:16,380 --> 01:39:19,240
Yeah, cause they're like, oh, we can't...

2872
01:39:19,240 --> 01:39:20,000
interfere.

2873
01:39:20,540 --> 01:39:21,160
That's us.

2874
01:39:21,280 --> 01:39:22,140
We're not bad people.

2875
01:39:22,340 --> 01:39:23,540
It's literally in the rules.

2876
01:39:24,180 --> 01:39:25,800
We're not bad people?

2877
01:39:26,960 --> 01:39:28,920
It's called circle of life.

2878
01:39:29,320 --> 01:39:29,780
Yeah.

2879
01:39:30,400 --> 01:39:32,780
There's a lot of drowned around here, so just go.

2880
01:39:33,380 --> 01:39:34,300
I'm going, I'm going.

2881
01:39:34,400 --> 01:39:36,820
Even though we've lost like 70% of like...

2882
01:39:36,820 --> 01:39:37,780
some of the species.

2883
01:39:38,220 --> 01:39:40,180
Why are you staying against the...

2884
01:39:40,180 --> 01:39:42,000
Cause I'm trying to find a mountain!

2885
01:39:42,800 --> 01:39:45,420
We're also trying to find treasure ships, right?

2886
01:39:46,400 --> 01:39:47,820
I mean, I guess.

2887
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:50,080
Look, I just had a dragoon come into my chest!

2888
01:39:50,120 --> 01:39:52,160
And I'm a dragoon and I'm sabotaging Mint.

2889
01:39:53,800 --> 01:39:55,080
What do you have to say about that?

2890
01:39:56,320 --> 01:39:57,980
I bet he's not even a dragoon.

2891
01:39:57,980 --> 01:39:58,440
Who was it?

2892
01:39:58,620 --> 01:39:59,080
Call him out.

2893
01:39:59,420 --> 01:40:00,420
What's his name?

2894
01:40:01,320 --> 01:40:02,460
What's his name?

2895
01:40:03,720 --> 01:40:04,620
What's his name?

2896
01:40:04,740 --> 01:40:05,880
I remember every dragoon.

2897
01:40:06,520 --> 01:40:08,140
You know every single one?

2898
01:40:08,220 --> 01:40:10,120
Yeah, I know every single one.

2899
01:40:12,240 --> 01:40:13,380
Their name is...

2900
01:40:13,380 --> 01:40:14,520
You're just making up a name now.

2901
01:40:14,880 --> 01:40:16,320
Quantum Twin Spark.

2902
01:40:16,480 --> 01:40:18,120
No, that is definitely a dragoon name.

2903
01:40:18,180 --> 01:40:20,060
No, no, no.

2904
01:40:20,200 --> 01:40:21,740
Quantum Twin Spark?

2905
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:23,040
Sounds like it.

2906
01:40:26,100 --> 01:40:28,980
If they're really a dragoon, they're gonna cry.

2907
01:40:29,140 --> 01:40:29,820
Hey, come back.

2908
01:40:30,700 --> 01:40:35,480
Oh yeah, Quantum Twin Spark literally came to my chat...

2909
01:40:35,480 --> 01:40:36,560
and said...

2910
01:40:36,560 --> 01:40:38,580
Did he super chat you too?

2911
01:40:39,100 --> 01:40:39,580
Yes.

2912
01:40:39,780 --> 01:40:42,360
I'm a wisp and I'm sabotaging Doki.

2913
01:40:42,720 --> 01:40:44,200
He's playing both teams!

2914
01:40:44,240 --> 01:40:45,780
He's playing, he's not even...

2915
01:40:45,780 --> 01:40:48,400
Oh, he's a wisp-goon.

2916
01:40:49,700 --> 01:40:50,900
Wisp-goon!

2917
01:40:51,800 --> 01:40:53,500
Maybe it's not dragoons or wisps.

2918
01:40:53,600 --> 01:40:55,020
It's the wisp-goons.

2919
01:40:56,760 --> 01:40:58,460
I wanna watch us both fail.

2920
01:40:58,580 --> 01:41:00,780
They want this stream to go on forever.

2921
01:41:01,020 --> 01:41:02,840
Yeah, they want it to go on for two...

2922
01:41:02,840 --> 01:41:04,000
They want it to go on for a month.

2923
01:41:04,160 --> 01:41:05,480
They want us to break their record.

2924
01:41:06,880 --> 01:41:08,300
The longest Minecraft?

2925
01:41:09,320 --> 01:41:11,080
The longest hardcore Minecraft.

2926
01:41:12,340 --> 01:41:13,640
Okay, we have to...

2927
01:41:13,640 --> 01:41:14,840
We can't die.

2928
01:41:14,960 --> 01:41:17,120
We've been on the seed for way too long.

2929
01:41:17,200 --> 01:41:18,540
For how little we've done.

2930
01:41:18,540 --> 01:41:21,380
How little progress we've made.

2931
01:41:22,380 --> 01:41:24,660
It's time to dig into a mountain.

2932
01:41:24,820 --> 01:41:25,300
It's time.

2933
01:41:25,740 --> 01:41:27,400
I'm getting off this boat.

2934
01:41:27,900 --> 01:41:30,880
Why is my...

2935
01:41:35,310 --> 01:41:38,770
Damn, two hours in and still no iron?

2936
01:41:39,030 --> 01:41:40,210
That's a record!

2937
01:41:40,790 --> 01:41:43,070
Because somebody refused to dig down!

2938
01:41:46,570 --> 01:41:49,730
Someone here doesn't want to dig down!

2939
01:41:49,730 --> 01:41:52,950
I was advocating to dig down.

2940
01:41:53,030 --> 01:41:54,130
There's a mountain in front of me.

2941
01:41:54,270 --> 01:41:55,350
There's a mountain in front of me.

2942
01:41:55,410 --> 01:41:58,290
Every time we've dig down, we've died.

2943
01:41:58,730 --> 01:41:59,730
That's two times!

2944
01:42:00,470 --> 01:42:01,810
That's two times!

2945
01:42:02,990 --> 01:42:03,690
Where'd you go?

2946
01:42:04,970 --> 01:42:05,870
I am at...

2947
01:42:06,950 --> 01:42:08,810
Minus three, three, seven, six...

2948
01:42:08,810 --> 01:42:09,750
One, five, nine, eight.

2949
01:42:11,070 --> 01:42:12,630
What the hell did you just say?

2950
01:42:13,110 --> 01:42:14,250
Your chat must've heard.

2951
01:42:18,010 --> 01:42:19,350
Let's just go to the mountain.

2952
01:42:20,450 --> 01:42:22,050
I'm literally at the mountain!

2953
01:42:22,750 --> 01:42:23,150
Already?

2954
01:42:23,630 --> 01:42:25,370
Yeah, there's a mountain in front of me.

2955
01:42:26,450 --> 01:42:27,690
I'm good in there, I'm walking.

2956
01:42:28,850 --> 01:42:29,770
Oh my God, I hope we're...

2957
01:42:29,770 --> 01:42:33,510
I hope we're looking at the same mountain right now.

2958
01:42:33,670 --> 01:42:34,510
What the...

2959
01:42:34,510 --> 01:42:38,080
How did that...

2960
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:39,520
How is there just coal on the ground?

2961
01:42:39,840 --> 01:42:40,480
Oh, because...

2962
01:42:40,480 --> 01:42:44,060
I didn't have room in my inventory, that's the stuff I dug.

2963
01:42:44,060 --> 01:42:44,400
Oh.

2964
01:42:45,920 --> 01:42:47,100
I was like, that's weird.

2965
01:42:47,820 --> 01:42:48,500
That is weird.

2966
01:42:48,680 --> 01:42:53,100
I'm on this mountain.

2967
01:42:54,040 --> 01:42:55,460
I see you, I see you.

2968
01:42:55,640 --> 01:42:57,780
No, no, no, stop, stop, stop!

2969
01:42:57,980 --> 01:42:58,400
Freeze!

2970
01:42:59,300 --> 01:42:59,740
Stop!

2971
01:43:00,940 --> 01:43:03,880
In the name of...

2972
01:43:07,660 --> 01:43:09,180
You don't know the words.

2973
01:43:09,480 --> 01:43:11,480
No, I know the words, but I don't want to bait people.

2974
01:43:11,480 --> 01:43:13,060
Oh, so true.

2975
01:43:13,440 --> 01:43:15,280
I know exactly who you're talking about.

2976
01:43:19,360 --> 01:43:21,640
I think I'll try harder to get that out of me.

2977
01:43:22,320 --> 01:43:24,700
Hey, hey, I'm digging a hole, I'm digging a hole.

2978
01:43:24,740 --> 01:43:26,640
Oh, you're gonna dig a hole?

2979
01:43:27,040 --> 01:43:28,380
Yeah, we're digging into the mountain.

2980
01:43:30,600 --> 01:43:32,760
I thought we're supposed to...

2981
01:43:32,760 --> 01:43:35,020
Fucking farm around the mountain.

2982
01:43:35,960 --> 01:43:38,040
This isn't the right kind of mountain, but it's okay.

2983
01:43:38,060 --> 01:43:38,980
We can dig inside.

2984
01:43:38,980 --> 01:43:40,960
Oh, my God.

2985
01:43:41,080 --> 01:43:42,280
Come on in, come on in.

2986
01:43:42,400 --> 01:43:43,160
Where are you?

2987
01:43:44,020 --> 01:43:45,500
Hey, hey, look over here.

2988
01:43:45,520 --> 01:43:46,520
Okay, okay, I'm here.

2989
01:43:47,100 --> 01:43:48,260
I'm putting a little torch there.

2990
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:49,420
Alright.

2991
01:43:51,480 --> 01:43:52,420
It's time.

2992
01:43:53,200 --> 01:43:54,340
I'm digging this side.

2993
01:43:56,020 --> 01:43:57,600
I'm gonna dig the other side.

2994
01:43:58,180 --> 01:43:58,740
What side?

2995
01:43:59,240 --> 01:43:59,940
This side.

2996
01:44:00,280 --> 01:44:02,660
Are we digging down or just digging around?

2997
01:44:04,320 --> 01:44:06,560
What is iron usually at, guys?

2998
01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:07,580
I don't know.

2999
01:44:08,080 --> 01:44:09,220
I'll put torches, too.

3000
01:44:12,380 --> 01:44:12,640
Oops.

3001
01:44:13,300 --> 01:44:14,780
My thing broke.

3002
01:44:16,020 --> 01:44:17,600
We're surrounded by stone.

3003
01:44:18,320 --> 01:44:18,680
Hey.

3004
01:44:19,380 --> 01:44:19,720
Lower?

3005
01:44:19,860 --> 01:44:20,520
We gotta go lower?

3006
01:44:20,760 --> 01:44:21,160
Oh, okay.

3007
01:44:21,780 --> 01:44:22,980
Okay, we gotta go way lower.

3008
01:44:23,560 --> 01:44:24,480
Here, I'm gonna start.

3009
01:44:24,640 --> 01:44:25,620
Here, come to my hole.

3010
01:44:25,940 --> 01:44:27,740
And we'll start digging the hole.

3011
01:44:27,980 --> 01:44:28,800
My head...

3012
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:30,160
My head right now.

3013
01:44:30,240 --> 01:44:30,860
Okay, give me a sec.

3014
01:44:30,960 --> 01:44:32,560
I'm trying to remember how to make sticks right now.

3015
01:44:32,560 --> 01:44:33,260
I'm...

3016
01:44:35,680 --> 01:44:36,440
Two planks.

3017
01:44:36,600 --> 01:44:37,820
I'm struggling at the moment.

3018
01:44:38,240 --> 01:44:39,660
Planks on top of each other.

3019
01:44:39,680 --> 01:44:41,280
This has been too much Minecraft.

3020
01:44:42,300 --> 01:44:43,040
Two planks.

3021
01:44:43,320 --> 01:44:44,060
This was your idea.

3022
01:44:44,280 --> 01:44:45,100
I'm just reminding you.

3023
01:44:45,140 --> 01:44:46,480
This was both our ideas.

3024
01:44:46,620 --> 01:44:47,800
You were like, that's a great idea.

3025
01:44:48,440 --> 01:44:49,720
That's a great idea, Doki.

3026
01:44:49,780 --> 01:44:50,420
Let's do it.

3027
01:44:51,280 --> 01:44:51,660
You...

3028
01:44:53,080 --> 01:44:54,660
Said that you wanted...

3029
01:44:54,660 --> 01:44:55,400
We're inspired.

3030
01:44:55,540 --> 01:44:56,380
You were the one inspired.

3031
01:44:56,600 --> 01:44:58,420
Yeah, and then you were like, wow, that's a great idea.

3032
01:44:58,480 --> 01:44:59,420
We should totally do it.

3033
01:44:59,420 --> 01:45:00,860
Oh shit, there's so much.

3034
01:45:01,660 --> 01:45:03,180
Wait, do we keep going down?

3035
01:45:03,840 --> 01:45:05,020
Yeah, keep going down.

3036
01:45:05,260 --> 01:45:05,960
What's the coordinates?

3037
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:08,180
We gotta get to five.

3038
01:45:08,720 --> 01:45:09,480
Where are we at?

3039
01:45:10,480 --> 01:45:11,340
Like 70.

3040
01:45:12,600 --> 01:45:13,660
I'm gonna dig down.

3041
01:45:14,040 --> 01:45:17,360
I'm digging down.

3042
01:45:17,520 --> 01:45:18,100
I can't.

3043
01:45:18,100 --> 01:45:19,020
I'm gonna dig down.

3044
01:45:19,220 --> 01:45:20,040
I can't.

3045
01:45:20,140 --> 01:45:21,400
You're digging a stair though, right?

3046
01:45:23,580 --> 01:45:24,700
Don't fall down.

3047
01:45:24,840 --> 01:45:25,660
Don't fall down.

3048
01:45:27,380 --> 01:45:29,320
Okay, how do you get back up?

3049
01:45:29,900 --> 01:45:30,600
I'm at 50.

3050
01:45:30,980 --> 01:45:32,100
We'll find out later.

3051
01:45:32,540 --> 01:45:33,220
Okay.

3052
01:45:36,020 --> 01:45:38,080
I'm still getting more...

3053
01:45:38,080 --> 01:45:38,540
Cold.

3054
01:45:38,920 --> 01:45:40,520
I hear...

3055
01:45:40,520 --> 01:45:42,340
Is that a creeper sound?

3056
01:45:43,280 --> 01:45:44,420
There's a creeper.

3057
01:45:45,260 --> 01:45:46,740
Creepers don't make sound though.

3058
01:45:46,880 --> 01:45:47,500
What's...

3059
01:45:47,500 --> 01:45:48,960
What's that?

3060
01:45:49,440 --> 01:45:52,360
What does...

3061
01:45:52,360 --> 01:45:52,620
What does that mean?

3062
01:45:54,200 --> 01:45:55,080
Oh, it's an Enderman.

3063
01:45:55,340 --> 01:45:56,340
We found an Enderman.

3064
01:45:57,040 --> 01:45:58,020
Oh, we need those.

3065
01:45:58,200 --> 01:45:58,940
Yeah, yeah.

3066
01:46:00,360 --> 01:46:02,200
Oh my God, there's so much coal here.

3067
01:46:02,320 --> 01:46:03,380
Do you have a lot of wood?

3068
01:46:05,220 --> 01:46:06,260
Yeah, I do.

3069
01:46:09,040 --> 01:46:10,080
Let's throw this away.

3070
01:46:10,140 --> 01:46:10,880
We don't need this.

3071
01:46:14,730 --> 01:46:15,530
What are you throwing?

3072
01:46:17,630 --> 01:46:18,030
Sandstone.

3073
01:46:18,630 --> 01:46:19,630
Oh yeah, we don't need that.

3074
01:46:21,610 --> 01:46:22,210
Oh!

3075
01:46:22,810 --> 01:46:23,690
What did you find?

3076
01:46:23,870 --> 01:46:25,510
Oh, thank God I didn't dig down.

3077
01:46:26,670 --> 01:46:28,030
What did you find?

3078
01:46:28,310 --> 01:46:31,290
I found a very, very deep cave.

3079
01:46:32,930 --> 01:46:35,110
I picked the right...

3080
01:46:35,110 --> 01:46:36,450
Oh my God!

3081
01:46:36,510 --> 01:46:39,450
If I dug down one more time...

3082
01:46:47,350 --> 01:46:49,510
Guys, my duty is the stairs.

3083
01:46:50,590 --> 01:46:51,750
I'm stair duty.

3084
01:46:52,490 --> 01:46:54,850
There's only one more.

3085
01:46:55,370 --> 01:46:56,550
If I dug one...

3086
01:46:58,290 --> 01:46:59,730
This is good enough.

3087
01:46:59,970 --> 01:47:03,670
Oh my gosh, I almost just fell into your hole.

3088
01:47:04,090 --> 01:47:04,750
Wait, am I...

3089
01:47:04,750 --> 01:47:05,990
There's no way, guys.

3090
01:47:06,830 --> 01:47:07,730
There's no way.

3091
01:47:07,790 --> 01:47:09,490
What biome am I in right now?

3092
01:47:09,670 --> 01:47:11,230
No, it's the dripstone cave.

3093
01:47:11,590 --> 01:47:13,310
Someone was like, oh my God, you're in the deep dark.

3094
01:47:13,410 --> 01:47:14,250
That's the dripstone.

3095
01:47:15,110 --> 01:47:16,290
Oh, no, yeah.

3096
01:47:16,530 --> 01:47:17,910
You know when you're in the deep dark.

3097
01:47:18,110 --> 01:47:19,870
It's got the glowy stuff.

3098
01:47:20,010 --> 01:47:20,730
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3099
01:47:22,570 --> 01:47:23,870
I can't believe it.

3100
01:47:23,870 --> 01:47:27,230
I literally stopped just at the right time.

3101
01:47:27,530 --> 01:47:28,670
You guys, no sabotaging.

3102
01:47:28,910 --> 01:47:30,870
My chat is trying to have me sabotage you.

3103
01:47:34,580 --> 01:47:34,980
What?

3104
01:47:35,160 --> 01:47:35,940
Why did you go silent?

3105
01:47:36,580 --> 01:47:38,700
No, I'm just curious on how you're gonna do this.

3106
01:47:39,720 --> 01:47:40,560
I'm building stairs.

3107
01:47:41,200 --> 01:47:41,480
Yeah?

3108
01:47:47,040 --> 01:47:47,780
It's fine.

3109
01:47:49,460 --> 01:47:50,520
You messed this up.

3110
01:47:50,620 --> 01:47:52,440
How did I mess it up?

3111
01:47:52,460 --> 01:47:52,720
There.

3112
01:47:53,020 --> 01:47:53,480
Oh my God.

3113
01:47:53,480 --> 01:47:54,560
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

3114
01:47:54,700 --> 01:47:56,300
It's literally one more block.

3115
01:47:57,900 --> 01:48:02,560
If I did one more block, I would have died.

3116
01:48:06,640 --> 01:48:08,500
Oh, it looks so easy.

3117
01:48:10,320 --> 01:48:11,240
Oh, no.

3118
01:48:11,440 --> 01:48:13,640
What will happen if you just...

3119
01:48:13,640 --> 01:48:14,220
Oh, no.

3120
01:48:14,220 --> 01:48:17,040
Let's keep going and we'll find iron eventually.

3121
01:48:18,020 --> 01:48:19,280
Should I cover this up?

3122
01:48:19,960 --> 01:48:20,900
Oh, never mind.

3123
01:48:20,960 --> 01:48:21,540
Don't go this way.

3124
01:48:21,540 --> 01:48:22,680
Let's go this way.

3125
01:48:23,680 --> 01:48:26,160
Why does it keep getting more and more dangerous?

3126
01:48:28,260 --> 01:48:30,000
Because we're living on the edge.

3127
01:48:30,700 --> 01:48:32,640
I don't like the edge anymore.

3128
01:48:33,060 --> 01:48:35,180
I feel like if we dig down, we're gonna...

3129
01:48:35,180 --> 01:48:37,060
This is what happens when you dig down.

3130
01:48:38,300 --> 01:48:39,780
This is what you wanted.

3131
01:48:40,140 --> 01:48:42,240
You wanted to dig in the mountain.

3132
01:48:45,500 --> 01:48:47,280
Oh, there's so many endermen.

3133
01:48:47,660 --> 01:48:49,920
There's so many endermen near us.

3134
01:48:49,920 --> 01:48:51,780
Why is there so much copper?

3135
01:48:52,680 --> 01:48:54,200
Where are the fucking iron?

3136
01:48:54,580 --> 01:48:55,580
Where is the iron?

3137
01:48:56,020 --> 01:48:56,580
What are we at?

3138
01:48:56,780 --> 01:48:58,160
Oh, we need to go further down.

3139
01:48:58,560 --> 01:49:00,220
Yeah, but down is death.

3140
01:49:00,740 --> 01:49:01,960
This isn't the right mountain.

3141
01:49:03,160 --> 01:49:04,720
We need to go to the mountain.

3142
01:49:05,120 --> 01:49:07,080
Wait, I can make another stair here.

3143
01:49:07,440 --> 01:49:07,800
Oh, okay.

3144
01:49:07,880 --> 01:49:08,260
Go, go, go.

3145
01:49:08,320 --> 01:49:09,900
I need to throw some stuff away.

3146
01:49:10,420 --> 01:49:11,360
Too much copper.

3147
01:49:14,740 --> 01:49:15,940
Cobble, cobble, cobble.

3148
01:49:16,960 --> 01:49:17,360
Okay.

3149
01:49:19,920 --> 01:49:22,440
We can't sabotage each other because we want to get out of here.

3150
01:49:22,620 --> 01:49:22,680
No, we can't.

3151
01:49:22,900 --> 01:49:24,620
You guys, this is the real thing.

3152
01:49:25,060 --> 01:49:26,540
We're not restarting.

3153
01:49:26,660 --> 01:49:28,300
This is where we're gonna...

3154
01:49:28,300 --> 01:49:29,040
make it.

3155
01:49:30,840 --> 01:49:31,680
Oh my God.

3156
01:49:32,200 --> 01:49:33,760
He's like right next to us.

3157
01:49:36,480 --> 01:49:37,620
He's like right here.

3158
01:49:37,840 --> 01:49:38,180
Oh, that was me.

3159
01:49:38,480 --> 01:49:40,060
He was like literally right here.

3160
01:49:40,480 --> 01:49:40,780
Yeah.

3161
01:49:42,980 --> 01:49:44,440
What corner are we on now?

3162
01:49:45,820 --> 01:49:46,720
Don't worry about it.

3163
01:49:46,740 --> 01:49:47,380
Just keep going down.

3164
01:49:50,340 --> 01:49:53,340
I feel like we're gonna be going down forever.

3165
01:49:56,260 --> 01:49:59,380
I told you it's not the right type of mountain, but it's okay.

3166
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:01,440
Why didn't we just find a hole?

3167
01:50:02,260 --> 01:50:03,560
Wouldn't a hole be easier?

3168
01:50:05,880 --> 01:50:07,680
Mint, wouldn't a hole be easier?

3169
01:50:07,840 --> 01:50:08,960
Why didn't we just find a hole?

3170
01:50:09,020 --> 01:50:10,340
Why did you make me dig a mountain?

3171
01:50:13,640 --> 01:50:14,080
Okay.

3172
01:50:15,480 --> 01:50:17,000
I got an eerie noise.

3173
01:50:17,640 --> 01:50:19,500
Yeah, I think that was the Enderman.

3174
01:50:20,140 --> 01:50:21,160
No, it was not.

3175
01:50:23,080 --> 01:50:24,980
Okay, we're almost close to where Iron...

3176
01:50:24,980 --> 01:50:26,600
Okay, now I think we can...

3177
01:50:26,600 --> 01:50:27,620
just like tunnel.

3178
01:50:28,080 --> 01:50:29,820
Alright, your turn.

3179
01:50:30,900 --> 01:50:32,600
Time to go forward.

3180
01:50:32,820 --> 01:50:34,500
Wouldn't monsters spawn behind us?

3181
01:50:34,500 --> 01:50:37,200
Because we just left it, you know...

3182
01:50:37,200 --> 01:50:38,640
Yeah, that's a potential risk.

3183
01:50:38,720 --> 01:50:40,100
Okay, you know what?

3184
01:50:40,280 --> 01:50:41,380
We like it risky.

3185
01:50:42,700 --> 01:50:45,360
Oh, I hear a skelly man right next to me.

3186
01:50:45,360 --> 01:50:46,880
Oh, that means we're like...

3187
01:50:46,880 --> 01:50:47,320
Okay.

3188
01:50:48,360 --> 01:50:49,840
How does that mean we're okay?

3189
01:50:50,020 --> 01:50:53,220
That means we're like closer to the ground now.

3190
01:50:53,300 --> 01:50:54,600
You know, we won't fall to our deaths.

3191
01:50:54,700 --> 01:50:55,640
Okay, I'll go right side.

3192
01:50:56,360 --> 01:50:57,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3193
01:50:58,300 --> 01:50:59,400
I hear dripping.

3194
01:51:00,200 --> 01:51:02,020
Oh, Iron!

3195
01:51:02,380 --> 01:51:03,000
You found Iron?

3196
01:51:03,800 --> 01:51:04,520
I found one.

3197
01:51:06,320 --> 01:51:06,780
Iron!

3198
01:51:09,480 --> 01:51:10,360
I found one.

3199
01:51:11,500 --> 01:51:12,740
I mean, you know...

3200
01:51:12,740 --> 01:51:14,260
One is something, I guess.

3201
01:51:14,980 --> 01:51:15,200
Yeah.

3202
01:51:16,360 --> 01:51:18,960
I'm tired of these stone pickaxes.

3203
01:51:19,840 --> 01:51:20,900
We'll get there soon.

3204
01:51:21,560 --> 01:51:23,860
I'm tired of these stone pickaxes.

3205
01:51:24,160 --> 01:51:25,060
When will we...

3206
01:51:25,060 --> 01:51:27,040
When will we hit it big?

3207
01:51:27,260 --> 01:51:28,680
When will we hit it big?

3208
01:51:28,980 --> 01:51:31,020
When will our streamer luck kick in?

3209
01:51:31,060 --> 01:51:33,820
When will our streamer luck kick in?

3210
01:51:33,840 --> 01:51:35,600
When will our streamer luck kick in?

3211
01:51:35,600 --> 01:51:36,760
Oh wait, I already made a furnace.

3212
01:51:36,940 --> 01:51:38,160
Okay, well, I have an extra one.

3213
01:51:39,700 --> 01:51:40,020
Oh.

3214
01:51:40,020 --> 01:51:40,820
Oh.

3215
01:51:41,240 --> 01:51:42,980
For when we wanna cook the Iron.

3216
01:51:43,120 --> 01:51:44,500
Actually, I could probably cook the Iron.

3217
01:51:45,920 --> 01:51:46,600
What's that?

3218
01:51:47,140 --> 01:51:47,560
Nothing.

3219
01:51:48,940 --> 01:51:50,100
We'll go this way now.

3220
01:51:51,680 --> 01:51:53,280
Why is that boarded up, huh?

3221
01:51:53,580 --> 01:51:54,780
Why don't you check it out?

3222
01:51:54,880 --> 01:51:56,400
Come over here.

3223
01:51:57,240 --> 01:51:59,080
You wonder why it's boarded up?

3224
01:51:59,400 --> 01:52:00,680
Alright, come over here.

3225
01:52:01,780 --> 01:52:02,320
Dig it.

3226
01:52:06,230 --> 01:52:07,350
Oh, there's nothing here.

3227
01:52:07,730 --> 01:52:08,810
Come on, dig another one.

3228
01:52:08,810 --> 01:52:10,130
Oh, I see.

3229
01:52:10,450 --> 01:52:11,810
Did you...

3230
01:52:13,090 --> 01:52:14,870
That's your torch.

3231
01:52:16,130 --> 01:52:16,770
You see it?

3232
01:52:17,310 --> 01:52:18,410
It was your torch.

3233
01:52:18,810 --> 01:52:20,270
Are you just gonna abandon it?

3234
01:52:20,590 --> 01:52:21,270
Oh my God, creeper!

3235
01:52:27,840 --> 01:52:30,780
Now you know why I abandoned it.

3236
01:52:31,120 --> 01:52:32,740
Yeah, but I got your torch back.

3237
01:52:34,420 --> 01:52:35,680
Oh, thank you.

3238
01:52:36,060 --> 01:52:38,280
My 53rd torch.

3239
01:52:38,280 --> 01:52:39,060
Insane.

3240
01:52:39,900 --> 01:52:40,720
It's important.

3241
01:52:41,560 --> 01:52:42,620
Every torch matters.

3242
01:52:43,380 --> 01:52:44,120
This is hardcore.

3243
01:52:44,960 --> 01:52:46,980
Every material is precious.

3244
01:52:47,860 --> 01:52:49,460
I'm in another area.

3245
01:52:50,060 --> 01:52:51,640
What do you mean another area?

3246
01:52:54,160 --> 01:52:55,340
Where are you going?

3247
01:52:57,200 --> 01:52:58,300
What does that mean?

3248
01:52:59,380 --> 01:53:00,180
Nice.

3249
01:53:00,500 --> 01:53:02,320
Just one?

3250
01:53:02,920 --> 01:53:04,560
No, I found four.

3251
01:53:08,280 --> 01:53:09,960
Four whole irons.

3252
01:53:10,320 --> 01:53:10,740
Okay.

3253
01:53:11,440 --> 01:53:12,720
Yeah, where's your four iron?

3254
01:53:13,340 --> 01:53:15,400
I have currently in my inventory...

3255
01:53:16,040 --> 01:53:18,280
Five, six...

3256
01:53:21,220 --> 01:53:21,860
Seven...

3257
01:53:21,860 --> 01:53:22,280
Eight...

3258
01:53:24,340 --> 01:53:24,980
Nine...

3259
01:53:26,300 --> 01:53:26,940
Ten...

3260
01:53:27,940 --> 01:53:28,580
Eleven...

3261
01:53:28,580 --> 01:53:30,200
Oh my God, no, I had to count past ten.

3262
01:53:32,860 --> 01:53:33,840
Thanks, Elmo.

3263
01:53:34,100 --> 01:53:36,360
Did you see the Sesame Street Twitter account?

3264
01:53:36,360 --> 01:53:38,420
Got super...

3265
01:53:39,400 --> 01:53:40,120
Like...

3266
01:53:40,120 --> 01:53:41,240
Emo?

3267
01:53:42,340 --> 01:53:42,940
Emo?

3268
01:53:44,160 --> 01:53:46,520
Cookie Monster and like...

3269
01:53:46,520 --> 01:53:48,680
All the Sesame Street accounts were like...

3270
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:50,340
It's okay, guys.

3271
01:53:50,340 --> 01:53:52,280
If you're having a bad day...

3272
01:53:52,280 --> 01:53:54,320
They were being like those...

3273
01:53:54,320 --> 01:53:55,760
Self-help Twitter accounts.

3274
01:53:56,580 --> 01:53:56,720
Oh.

3275
01:53:57,340 --> 01:54:00,120
I found an area.

3276
01:54:00,220 --> 01:54:01,100
Oh, I found Lapis.

3277
01:54:01,960 --> 01:54:02,660
Yeah, me too.

3278
01:54:02,660 --> 01:54:03,980
Wait, hold on.

3279
01:54:08,970 --> 01:54:10,230
I'll make sure I don't die.

3280
01:54:11,190 --> 01:54:12,930
Is Lapis important to us?

3281
01:54:14,530 --> 01:54:15,050
Um...

3282
01:54:15,050 --> 01:54:16,330
Actually, yeah.

3283
01:54:16,430 --> 01:54:17,950
I think we should get it...

3284
01:54:17,950 --> 01:54:19,310
For when we need to enchant stuff.

3285
01:54:19,490 --> 01:54:19,770
Okay.

3286
01:54:19,990 --> 01:54:20,550
Oh, you're right.

3287
01:54:21,030 --> 01:54:22,110
We should get that.

3288
01:54:22,350 --> 01:54:25,190
Yeah, they were doing like self-help tweets and stuff.

3289
01:54:25,870 --> 01:54:29,690
And like super encouraging stuff too.

3290
01:54:30,070 --> 01:54:31,870
I like Elmo's Twitter though.

3291
01:54:32,110 --> 01:54:33,130
Yeah, Elmo...

3292
01:54:33,130 --> 01:54:35,630
Yeah, but it was like all the Sesame Street.

3293
01:54:35,630 --> 01:54:35,690
All of them?

3294
01:54:35,730 --> 01:54:36,350
Yeah, all of them.

3295
01:54:36,410 --> 01:54:37,450
It was like Cookie Monster too.

3296
01:54:37,630 --> 01:54:39,130
And then like... Sesame Street, okay.

3297
01:54:39,510 --> 01:54:39,710
Yeah.

3298
01:54:40,550 --> 01:54:42,190
Sesame Street's going through it.

3299
01:54:45,530 --> 01:54:45,970
Wow!

3300
01:54:46,970 --> 01:54:48,070
Did you almost fall?

3301
01:54:48,270 --> 01:54:48,530
No.

3302
01:54:49,290 --> 01:54:50,130
There's a...

3303
01:54:50,130 --> 01:54:52,190
There's a little zombie cutting over.

3304
01:54:52,490 --> 01:54:53,070
He's not happy.

3305
01:54:53,610 --> 01:54:54,310
Little zombie.

3306
01:54:54,570 --> 01:54:54,810
Okay.

3307
01:54:55,330 --> 01:54:55,850
I'm gonna get a sword.

3308
01:54:55,870 --> 01:54:57,910
Why is there so much copper in here?

3309
01:54:57,910 --> 01:54:59,130
Oh, he's blocked by the...

3310
01:55:00,310 --> 01:55:00,750
Sword.

3311
01:55:00,750 --> 01:55:03,550
He's blocked by my little torch.

3312
01:55:04,370 --> 01:55:04,590
Oh.

3313
01:55:04,750 --> 01:55:06,030
I found a big area.

3314
01:55:08,570 --> 01:55:08,990
Alright.

3315
01:55:10,070 --> 01:55:10,490
Nice.

3316
01:55:10,630 --> 01:55:10,850
Okay.

3317
01:55:11,090 --> 01:55:12,870
I'm gonna grab Lapis.

3318
01:55:13,070 --> 01:55:13,470
Oh, look.

3319
01:55:13,530 --> 01:55:14,530
I killed my first monster.

3320
01:55:15,130 --> 01:55:16,330
I'm gonna get the Lapis too.

3321
01:55:18,670 --> 01:55:20,050
Can you get it with the stone?

3322
01:55:21,050 --> 01:55:21,270
Huh?

3323
01:55:21,470 --> 01:55:21,910
Oh, okay.

3324
01:55:21,910 --> 01:55:22,210
Nice.

3325
01:55:22,910 --> 01:55:24,990
I didn't know if you could get Lapis with the stone or not.

3326
01:55:25,070 --> 01:55:25,570
Yeah, I can.

3327
01:55:26,390 --> 01:55:26,810
Wait.

3328
01:55:26,950 --> 01:55:27,870
No, I can't.

3329
01:55:27,870 --> 01:55:28,570
Oh.

3330
01:55:29,210 --> 01:55:29,550
Yes, you can.

3331
01:55:30,910 --> 01:55:31,830
Oh, wait, wait.

3332
01:55:31,930 --> 01:55:33,550
Okay, I didn't use... I didn't...

3333
01:55:33,550 --> 01:55:34,330
I have too much in my inventory.

3334
01:55:34,490 --> 01:55:35,230
We don't need raw rabbit.

3335
01:55:36,830 --> 01:55:37,870
Uh... I'm gonna...

3336
01:55:38,430 --> 01:55:39,690
Actually, that's food though.

3337
01:55:40,110 --> 01:55:40,990
That's true.

3338
01:55:41,270 --> 01:55:42,490
I need to clean my inventory.

3339
01:55:43,470 --> 01:55:44,310
Should I make a shield?

3340
01:55:44,650 --> 01:55:46,570
Can you eat glow berries or no?

3341
01:55:47,250 --> 01:55:48,270
Yeah, you can eat them.

3342
01:55:48,490 --> 01:55:48,790
Okay.

3343
01:55:49,130 --> 01:55:50,390
I'll just eat the glow berries.

3344
01:55:51,910 --> 01:55:53,630
We don't need copper, right?

3345
01:55:54,270 --> 01:55:55,390
No, we don't need copper.

3346
01:55:55,390 --> 01:55:56,930
Okay, so I can throw those away.

3347
01:55:57,570 --> 01:56:00,470
Alright, I'm gonna start smelting my stuff.

3348
01:56:00,610 --> 01:56:01,110
Me too.

3349
01:56:02,430 --> 01:56:04,470
I need to start smelting these as well.

3350
01:56:04,970 --> 01:56:06,290
I have a lot of iron.

3351
01:56:07,390 --> 01:56:07,770
Alright.

3352
01:56:08,210 --> 01:56:09,150
Let's make a shield.

3353
01:56:09,510 --> 01:56:10,830
And we'll make a good sword.

3354
01:56:11,310 --> 01:56:13,330
Alright, and I can make armor.

3355
01:56:15,130 --> 01:56:16,170
Okay, let's...

3356
01:56:16,170 --> 01:56:16,830
I mean...

3357
01:56:17,950 --> 01:56:20,110
Where's my... Okay, there's my chest.

3358
01:56:20,570 --> 01:56:21,910
There's my crafting table.

3359
01:56:22,470 --> 01:56:22,990
Furnace.

3360
01:56:22,990 --> 01:56:25,090
Get rid of this bamboo.

3361
01:56:25,510 --> 01:56:26,990
And then...

3362
01:56:28,730 --> 01:56:29,730
Iron age happening.

3363
01:56:29,950 --> 01:56:31,170
Oh my god, we're doing it.

3364
01:56:31,290 --> 01:56:32,870
Oh my god, we're in the...

3365
01:56:33,730 --> 01:56:34,530
We're expanding!

3366
01:56:35,790 --> 01:56:36,810
We're doing it!

3367
01:56:36,810 --> 01:56:37,730
It was worth it!

3368
01:56:38,830 --> 01:56:40,170
We're doing it!

3369
01:56:40,510 --> 01:56:43,470
I don't need this gravel.

3370
01:56:43,890 --> 01:56:45,150
Oh my god.

3371
01:56:45,610 --> 01:56:47,490
We're actually...

3372
01:56:47,490 --> 01:56:50,010
We're actually doing it.

3373
01:56:50,430 --> 01:56:52,970
We're gonna make it out of here!

3374
01:56:52,970 --> 01:56:54,950
We're gonna make it out of here!

3375
01:56:55,630 --> 01:56:55,970
Maybe.

3376
01:56:56,690 --> 01:56:58,430
They didn't believe us.

3377
01:56:58,670 --> 01:56:59,270
I know.

3378
01:56:59,290 --> 01:57:00,850
They thought we were gonna die here.

3379
01:57:01,610 --> 01:57:03,170
This is literally the run.

3380
01:57:03,790 --> 01:57:04,450
This is the run.

3381
01:57:07,470 --> 01:57:09,430
I knew that was gonna happen.

3382
01:57:10,030 --> 01:57:10,790
Alright, we're safe.

3383
01:57:10,830 --> 01:57:11,450
We're still safe.

3384
01:57:12,490 --> 01:57:14,690
Okay, uh, where...

3385
01:57:14,690 --> 01:57:16,350
Okay, um...

3386
01:57:16,350 --> 01:57:19,030
I'm gonna make my shield first.

3387
01:57:19,870 --> 01:57:20,130
Okay.

3388
01:57:21,970 --> 01:57:24,210
Where did I put my crafting table?

3389
01:57:24,550 --> 01:57:25,430
Did I leave it over there?

3390
01:57:25,570 --> 01:57:26,270
I don't know.

3391
01:57:27,010 --> 01:57:28,350
Okay, I can fight him.

3392
01:57:29,110 --> 01:57:29,610
Shield!

3393
01:57:30,130 --> 01:57:30,470
Yeah!

3394
01:57:30,990 --> 01:57:32,330
I have my shield too.

3395
01:57:32,690 --> 01:57:33,730
We're gonna make it.

3396
01:57:34,010 --> 01:57:34,910
We're gonna make it.

3397
01:57:35,410 --> 01:57:37,090
Okay, I'm gonna make a sword.

3398
01:57:38,850 --> 01:57:41,270
Okay, this skeleton needs to fucking be able to aim.

3399
01:57:42,870 --> 01:57:44,030
I did it!

3400
01:57:45,330 --> 01:57:46,350
Wait, what did you get?

3401
01:57:46,370 --> 01:57:47,550
I killed a skelly!

3402
01:57:47,550 --> 01:57:49,730
Oh, you got the thingy.

3403
01:57:50,270 --> 01:57:52,490
I got the shield, yeah.

3404
01:57:52,770 --> 01:57:53,570
Okay, nice.

3405
01:57:53,970 --> 01:57:55,870
Alright, now...

3406
01:57:55,870 --> 01:57:57,190
Now I'm gonna make armor.

3407
01:57:58,010 --> 01:58:00,430
I'm making... oh, I should make armor first.

3408
01:58:02,070 --> 01:58:03,630
I want the iron pickaxe.

3409
01:58:04,750 --> 01:58:06,650
Actually, I should get iron pickaxe first.

3410
01:58:06,690 --> 01:58:07,090
You're right.

3411
01:58:07,750 --> 01:58:08,230
No, no.

3412
01:58:08,370 --> 01:58:09,090
Get armor first.

3413
01:58:09,350 --> 01:58:09,830
No.

3414
01:58:11,190 --> 01:58:12,090
It's too late.

3415
01:58:12,390 --> 01:58:12,870
I didn't listen.

3416
01:58:15,470 --> 01:58:17,470
Iron pickaxe.

3417
01:58:17,690 --> 01:58:20,170
Wait, do I not...

3418
01:58:20,530 --> 01:58:23,070
Wait, what?

3419
01:58:24,810 --> 01:58:25,510
Why is it not working?

3420
01:58:25,610 --> 01:58:26,610
Do I have too much stuff in my inventory?

3421
01:58:26,850 --> 01:58:27,370
I do.

3422
01:58:28,390 --> 01:58:29,090
There we go.

3423
01:58:32,230 --> 01:58:34,010
Oh my god, I have too much stuff in my inventory.

3424
01:58:34,110 --> 01:58:34,830
What do I not want?

3425
01:58:34,930 --> 01:58:35,850
What do I not need?

3426
01:58:36,810 --> 01:58:39,050
I don't know, but they're all important to me!

3427
01:58:40,270 --> 01:58:41,470
Oh wait, why do I have another bed?

3428
01:58:43,350 --> 01:58:43,990
I don't know.

3429
01:58:43,990 --> 01:58:44,390
I don't know.

3430
01:58:46,530 --> 01:58:47,890
You went down here.

3431
01:58:47,970 --> 01:58:48,570
Oh, I see your name.

3432
01:58:48,750 --> 01:58:49,610
You're very far away.

3433
01:58:49,650 --> 01:58:51,550
I don't know where I go to.

3434
01:58:51,610 --> 01:58:52,970
I go to too many places.

3435
01:58:53,130 --> 01:58:53,790
I don't know.

3436
01:58:54,150 --> 01:58:54,690
Oh, I see you.

3437
01:58:54,950 --> 01:58:55,310
I'm here.

3438
01:58:56,150 --> 01:58:56,450
No!

3439
01:58:56,610 --> 01:58:57,530
Oh yeah, the copper!

3440
01:58:57,710 --> 01:58:58,230
Okay, oh hey.

3441
01:58:58,910 --> 01:58:59,990
I'm gonna throw away the copper.

3442
01:59:00,210 --> 01:59:00,970
I have like 31.

3443
01:59:01,150 --> 01:59:01,870
Oh look, there's more lapis here.

3444
01:59:02,990 --> 01:59:04,890
Yeah, I'm trying to make armor right now.

3445
01:59:05,750 --> 01:59:06,150
Okay.

3446
01:59:06,830 --> 01:59:08,610
Okay, I don't need my golden hoe.

3447
01:59:09,330 --> 01:59:10,750
I have my hoe here.

3448
01:59:10,910 --> 01:59:11,890
Will this kill me?

3449
01:59:11,890 --> 01:59:12,270
Yeah.

3450
01:59:14,250 --> 01:59:14,770
Okay.

3451
01:59:15,870 --> 01:59:17,370
I need an iron sword.

3452
01:59:17,930 --> 01:59:20,370
And I'm gonna throw away my stone sword.

3453
01:59:22,030 --> 01:59:24,390
And I'll throw this here too.

3454
01:59:24,630 --> 01:59:25,590
I don't need the emerald.

3455
01:59:25,590 --> 01:59:27,890
And then...

3456
01:59:29,530 --> 01:59:30,870
Yeah, you don't need that emerald.

3457
01:59:31,070 --> 01:59:32,030
There's more to our left.

3458
01:59:33,090 --> 01:59:33,590
More over here?

3459
01:59:34,090 --> 01:59:34,410
Yeah.

3460
01:59:35,010 --> 01:59:39,990
Oh yeah, I can make... No, I feel like I'm wasting wheat... Wasting space.

3461
01:59:40,890 --> 01:59:41,690
For the wheat?

3462
01:59:42,170 --> 01:59:47,210
Yeah, they're saying, oh, you can make like wheat off of the hay and stuff, but I waste too much space there already.

3463
01:59:47,750 --> 01:59:50,030
Well, if you have the...

3464
01:59:50,030 --> 01:59:56,030
If you have it turned into bread, then it's, you know... Yeah, but then I'll get too much bread.

3465
01:59:57,470 --> 01:59:58,690
It's good to have bread.

3466
01:59:58,850 --> 01:59:59,690
No, it's too much bread.

3467
02:00:00,670 --> 02:00:02,410
There's a limit to how much bread you can have.

3468
02:00:02,490 --> 02:00:02,990
There's a limit.

3469
02:00:04,450 --> 02:00:07,570
Okay, I need shoes and... Alright, let's get iron.

3470
02:00:07,570 --> 02:00:09,570
I need shoes and...

3471
02:00:10,270 --> 02:00:12,410
I already have a lot of armor.

3472
02:00:14,670 --> 02:00:15,910
Let's see, where's my bread?

3473
02:00:16,030 --> 02:00:17,190
Wait, where did I put my bread?

3474
02:00:17,870 --> 02:00:18,650
Oh, there it is.

3475
02:00:19,450 --> 02:00:20,270
Wait, did you go down?

3476
02:00:20,910 --> 02:00:21,170
Yeah.

3477
02:00:24,590 --> 02:00:25,390
Alright, I'm here.

3478
02:00:26,310 --> 02:00:27,230
Wait, what was the purpose?

3479
02:00:28,670 --> 02:00:30,170
The dripstone makes it so annoying.

3480
02:00:30,350 --> 02:00:30,750
That's true.

3481
02:00:30,810 --> 02:00:32,290
What was the purpose of going down here?

3482
02:00:33,470 --> 02:00:34,630
I don't know, to find iron?

3483
02:00:34,630 --> 02:00:34,670
Here?

3484
02:00:36,430 --> 02:00:37,750
Do we need more iron?

3485
02:00:38,370 --> 02:00:38,770
Yeah.

3486
02:00:39,610 --> 02:00:40,110
We do?

3487
02:00:40,530 --> 02:00:45,050
We have to have a plethora of shields and... We just need one.

3488
02:00:45,570 --> 02:00:46,390
No, you don't.

3489
02:00:46,430 --> 02:00:47,170
It'll break.

3490
02:00:47,870 --> 02:00:48,390
It will?

3491
02:00:49,290 --> 02:00:49,690
Yes.

3492
02:00:50,170 --> 02:00:50,490
Oh.

3493
02:00:52,410 --> 02:00:53,570
Oh, I should make a bucket.

3494
02:00:54,790 --> 02:00:55,730
Oh yeah, you can.

3495
02:00:55,870 --> 02:00:56,850
Oh yeah, I'm gonna go make a bucket.

3496
02:00:57,110 --> 02:00:57,470
Yeah, make a bucket.

3497
02:00:58,150 --> 02:00:59,410
Did you leave all your stuff up there?

3498
02:00:59,690 --> 02:01:00,010
Yeah.

3499
02:01:00,510 --> 02:01:01,890
We're gonna come back to it, right?

3500
02:01:02,990 --> 02:01:03,650
We're not?

3501
02:01:04,470 --> 02:01:04,850
Are we?

3502
02:01:05,130 --> 02:01:05,530
I don't know.

3503
02:01:05,650 --> 02:01:05,970
Okay, you're right.

3504
02:01:06,010 --> 02:01:07,550
I'll bring it back to me.

3505
02:01:08,270 --> 02:01:11,330
I'm gonna wait until it cooks and then I'll come back.

3506
02:01:11,350 --> 02:01:14,390
We also gotta get to the diamond, so I guess we can start diamond hunting.

3507
02:01:14,470 --> 02:01:16,470
Oh yeah, we might as well start now.

3508
02:01:16,890 --> 02:01:17,250
Yeah.

3509
02:01:17,490 --> 02:01:19,430
Okay, I'm gonna bring this out here.

3510
02:01:19,670 --> 02:01:20,450
Wait, where are we at?

3511
02:01:20,490 --> 02:01:20,850
25.

3512
02:01:21,470 --> 02:01:21,670
Okay.

3513
02:01:22,430 --> 02:01:24,290
So if we find iron...

3514
02:01:24,290 --> 02:01:26,290
I'm gonna strip mine for iron a little bit more.

3515
02:01:26,750 --> 02:01:29,030
Okay, what's the coordinates for diamond?

3516
02:01:31,030 --> 02:01:31,850
It's like...

3517
02:01:31,850 --> 02:01:33,030
Wait, it's like negative...

3518
02:01:33,670 --> 02:01:34,370
Alright, let's go.

3519
02:01:34,430 --> 02:01:35,150
Let's dig down.

3520
02:01:35,290 --> 02:01:35,710
It's time.

3521
02:01:35,730 --> 02:01:37,410
Hold on, I need more iron.

3522
02:01:37,510 --> 02:01:39,690
We can get iron while we're digging down.

3523
02:01:40,870 --> 02:01:42,730
It stops showing up though.

3524
02:01:42,770 --> 02:01:43,590
No, it doesn't.

3525
02:01:44,150 --> 02:01:45,550
It shows up with the diamond.

3526
02:01:46,330 --> 02:01:47,530
No, it doesn't.

3527
02:01:47,590 --> 02:01:48,110
It doesn't?

3528
02:01:48,150 --> 02:01:49,250
When did it change that?

3529
02:01:49,410 --> 02:01:50,410
It used to.

3530
02:01:51,410 --> 02:01:53,410
No, it stops showing up.

3531
02:01:53,450 --> 02:01:54,190
No, it doesn't.

3532
02:01:54,290 --> 02:01:54,590
No.

3533
02:01:55,250 --> 02:01:57,050
Oh, well then, I'm...

3534
02:01:57,050 --> 02:01:58,870
Alright, let's start digging down.

3535
02:01:59,130 --> 02:01:59,430
Alright.

3536
02:02:01,110 --> 02:02:02,650
Also, I don't know why you're listening to me.

3537
02:02:02,770 --> 02:02:04,610
I know less about Minecraft than you.

3538
02:02:05,110 --> 02:02:06,990
I don't know, I'm just...

3539
02:02:06,990 --> 02:02:08,070
I'm just vulnerable, maybe.

3540
02:02:09,870 --> 02:02:10,930
Wait, where did...

3541
02:02:10,930 --> 02:02:11,930
Where did you go from?

3542
02:02:12,770 --> 02:02:14,530
I don't know, I'm trying to find where you are.

3543
02:02:15,150 --> 02:02:15,990
Did you go...

3544
02:02:15,990 --> 02:02:18,230
Did you keep going forward?

3545
02:02:18,310 --> 02:02:19,070
Where did you go?

3546
02:02:19,770 --> 02:02:20,390
Where are you?

3547
02:02:21,050 --> 02:02:21,730
Did you go down?

3548
02:02:22,390 --> 02:02:25,050
I see you.

3549
02:02:25,050 --> 02:02:25,890
I see you.

3550
02:02:26,030 --> 02:02:27,050
I'm heading back to you.

3551
02:02:28,610 --> 02:02:29,470
Oh, I see you.

3552
02:02:29,790 --> 02:02:30,890
Why did you go all the way over there?

3553
02:02:30,950 --> 02:02:31,650
Why would I go there?

3554
02:02:32,110 --> 02:02:33,290
Where did your name go?

3555
02:02:33,770 --> 02:02:34,390
Oh, nevermind.

3556
02:02:34,470 --> 02:02:34,810
I'm here.

3557
02:02:35,090 --> 02:02:37,530
Okay, we can go down, and then we can just...

3558
02:02:37,530 --> 02:02:37,570
Alright.

3559
02:02:38,890 --> 02:02:39,630
Oh, there's more.

3560
02:02:39,710 --> 02:02:39,970
Hold on.

3561
02:02:40,070 --> 02:02:42,750
Alright, they said it was less of a chance, but that doesn't mean we won't get it.

3562
02:02:42,810 --> 02:02:43,570
We might as well.

3563
02:02:44,610 --> 02:02:46,910
Okay, I'm grabbing coal.

3564
02:02:47,390 --> 02:02:48,370
Alright, I'm digging down.

3565
02:02:50,550 --> 02:02:51,250
Oh my gosh.

3566
02:02:51,510 --> 02:02:53,150
I forgot to look at my computer yesterday.

3567
02:02:53,150 --> 02:02:54,510
Wait, it's starting to rattle again.

3568
02:02:54,930 --> 02:02:56,550
Wait, what?

3569
02:02:58,170 --> 02:03:00,170
My fan is like all messed up.

3570
02:03:00,350 --> 02:03:00,810
Oh, look.

3571
02:03:00,850 --> 02:03:01,010
See?

3572
02:03:01,170 --> 02:03:01,650
I told you.

3573
02:03:01,810 --> 02:03:02,590
I am right here.

3574
02:03:03,590 --> 02:03:04,710
It's just that easy.

3575
02:03:04,810 --> 02:03:05,290
Where are you?

3576
02:03:05,350 --> 02:03:06,190
I just dug down.

3577
02:03:07,130 --> 02:03:08,870
Are you like actually digging down?

3578
02:03:09,030 --> 02:03:09,310
Yeah.

3579
02:03:10,150 --> 02:03:11,270
I dug down.

3580
02:03:11,390 --> 02:03:12,950
I dug down next to you.

3581
02:03:13,310 --> 02:03:14,630
Wait, where am I?

3582
02:03:15,050 --> 02:03:17,970
I dug down right next to you.

3583
02:03:19,330 --> 02:03:21,150
Okay, I'm digging down again.

3584
02:03:21,150 --> 02:03:22,930
Okay, I'm digging down.

3585
02:03:23,930 --> 02:03:25,290
I'm digging down.

3586
02:03:25,650 --> 02:03:26,770
What's the coordinates for diamond?

3587
02:03:27,770 --> 02:03:29,250
Like, negative 50.

3588
02:03:29,910 --> 02:03:30,890
Okay, just...

3589
02:03:30,890 --> 02:03:32,370
We are at...

3590
02:03:32,370 --> 02:03:33,510
We are at 14.

3591
02:03:34,190 --> 02:03:36,810
Yeah, we gotta go.

3592
02:03:37,130 --> 02:03:37,790
We gotta dig.

3593
02:03:38,130 --> 02:03:40,950
Alright, how bad would it be if I...

3594
02:03:40,950 --> 02:03:43,750
If I just dug straight down?

3595
02:03:44,170 --> 02:03:45,450
Like, is it worth the risk?

3596
02:03:46,670 --> 02:03:47,270
Um...

3597
02:03:47,270 --> 02:03:47,990
Is it worth it?

3598
02:03:47,990 --> 02:03:52,650
A seasoned Minecraft person would probably say don't do it.

3599
02:03:52,790 --> 02:03:53,370
But...

3600
02:03:53,370 --> 02:03:55,230
Are we seasoned?

3601
02:03:55,930 --> 02:03:56,350
No.

3602
02:03:56,770 --> 02:03:59,990
Get over here.

3603
02:04:00,630 --> 02:04:01,970
Are you willing to risk this ride?

3604
02:04:02,390 --> 02:04:02,550
Yeah.

3605
02:04:03,450 --> 02:04:04,370
Get over here.

3606
02:04:04,770 --> 02:04:07,390
You know what that means.

3607
02:04:08,230 --> 02:04:08,530
Oh my God.

3608
02:04:08,930 --> 02:04:09,330
Alright.

3609
02:04:11,630 --> 02:04:12,370
Wait, that's an Enderman.

3610
02:04:12,990 --> 02:04:14,610
That's an Enderman next to you.

3611
02:04:14,610 --> 02:04:17,390
I think down is like an actual death pit.

3612
02:04:17,530 --> 02:04:18,610
Wait, let's...

3613
02:04:19,170 --> 02:04:19,510
Okay, wait.

3614
02:04:19,610 --> 02:04:20,830
Let me double check.

3615
02:04:22,030 --> 02:04:24,850
Wait, I think there's lava next to us.

3616
02:04:28,860 --> 02:04:30,420
I think I heard lava.

3617
02:04:32,860 --> 02:04:34,140
No, I hear the Enderman.

3618
02:04:34,460 --> 02:04:35,000
No, no.

3619
02:04:37,360 --> 02:04:37,840
It's...

3620
02:04:37,840 --> 02:04:38,800
Is this my music?

3621
02:04:39,140 --> 02:04:40,720
Is it my music?

3622
02:04:40,940 --> 02:04:41,660
I can't tell.

3623
02:04:41,740 --> 02:04:42,620
There's no lava.

3624
02:04:42,620 --> 02:04:43,400
There's no lava.

3625
02:04:44,440 --> 02:04:45,860
Okay, it might be my music.

3626
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:47,700
Alright, you ready then?

3627
02:04:48,880 --> 02:04:50,200
To risk this entire run?

3628
02:04:50,360 --> 02:04:51,620
I dig yours, you dig mine.

3629
02:04:52,140 --> 02:04:53,540
Alright, ready?

3630
02:04:56,300 --> 02:04:57,720
Wait, I need a head start.

3631
02:05:00,240 --> 02:05:01,980
My pickaxe is gonna die.

3632
02:05:02,680 --> 02:05:04,400
My pickaxe is gonna die.

3633
02:05:05,640 --> 02:05:07,900
No, I'm gonna be the one who dies first.

3634
02:05:08,280 --> 02:05:10,160
It'll be your fault if I die.

3635
02:05:10,160 --> 02:05:11,860
You're the one who's digging mine.

3636
02:05:11,860 --> 02:05:12,800
I agreed to this.

3637
02:05:12,920 --> 02:05:14,160
You agreed to it.

3638
02:05:14,240 --> 02:05:15,880
You're the one who's digging my block.

3639
02:05:16,380 --> 02:05:17,300
You said...

3640
02:05:17,960 --> 02:05:19,920
Alright, you wanna just do it?

3641
02:05:20,140 --> 02:05:20,360
Yeah.

3642
02:05:22,440 --> 02:05:24,380
Yeah, I need to make...

3643
02:05:24,380 --> 02:05:24,820
Can I have some iron?

3644
02:05:28,120 --> 02:05:29,820
Do you not have any iron blocks?

3645
02:05:30,340 --> 02:05:31,200
I have one left.

3646
02:05:31,220 --> 02:05:32,500
Go make your own iron.

3647
02:05:35,010 --> 02:05:36,710
I only have one iron ingot.

3648
02:05:37,810 --> 02:05:39,710
Go grab your iron ingot.

3649
02:05:39,710 --> 02:05:41,130
It's already burned!

3650
02:05:41,570 --> 02:05:42,670
How much do you need?

3651
02:05:44,250 --> 02:05:45,970
How much is a pickaxe?

3652
02:05:46,930 --> 02:05:47,510
It's like two.

3653
02:05:48,170 --> 02:05:49,270
Okay, then give me one more.

3654
02:05:50,310 --> 02:05:51,630
Alright, that's an I.O.U.

3655
02:05:51,690 --> 02:05:52,150
right there.

3656
02:05:52,350 --> 02:05:53,730
Yeah, you need to give me two more.

3657
02:05:54,250 --> 02:05:55,190
Oh my God.

3658
02:05:56,150 --> 02:05:57,130
That's an I.O.U.

3659
02:05:57,190 --> 02:05:57,810
right there.

3660
02:05:58,810 --> 02:05:59,530
Sure, yeah.

3661
02:06:02,830 --> 02:06:03,270
Alright.

3662
02:06:04,430 --> 02:06:05,230
Okay, one second.

3663
02:06:05,690 --> 02:06:06,290
It's almost done.

3664
02:06:06,870 --> 02:06:08,290
We are at...

3665
02:06:09,530 --> 02:06:10,390
Minus ten.

3666
02:06:10,730 --> 02:06:13,370
We still have 40 more.

3667
02:06:14,150 --> 02:06:16,650
Again, I'm making my pickaxe.

3668
02:06:16,730 --> 02:06:18,190
I'm gonna eat real fast.

3669
02:06:18,990 --> 02:06:20,070
Yum yum yum yum.

3670
02:06:20,250 --> 02:06:21,310
Yum yum yum yum.

3671
02:06:21,990 --> 02:06:22,970
Oh yeah, me too.

3672
02:06:22,970 --> 02:06:26,650
What if a creeper just falls on our head because we didn't put any torches above us?

3673
02:06:27,110 --> 02:06:28,050
I don't think they...

3674
02:06:28,050 --> 02:06:28,910
I think they're smarter.

3675
02:06:29,030 --> 02:06:30,670
I don't think they fall like that, right?

3676
02:06:34,110 --> 02:06:35,750
I don't know anymore.

3677
02:06:36,470 --> 02:06:37,690
I don't know.

3678
02:06:38,190 --> 02:06:39,290
We're at negative 11.

3679
02:06:39,390 --> 02:06:40,690
What if we just strip mine from here?

3680
02:06:40,930 --> 02:06:42,710
No, it has to be negative 50.

3681
02:06:44,110 --> 02:06:45,470
It said negative 50, right?

3682
02:06:46,510 --> 02:06:47,490
I think so.

3683
02:06:48,530 --> 02:06:50,290
They do fall in harder difficulties.

3684
02:06:50,770 --> 02:06:52,190
Well, we're at hardcore.

3685
02:06:53,790 --> 02:06:54,710
Hey, what the hell?

3686
02:06:54,790 --> 02:06:55,890
You're trying to sabotage me.

3687
02:06:55,890 --> 02:06:56,570
No, I'm not.

3688
02:06:56,650 --> 02:06:58,950
I'm literally trying to fucking dig.

3689
02:06:58,950 --> 02:07:01,010
You literally attacked me.

3690
02:07:01,110 --> 02:07:02,070
No, I didn't.

3691
02:07:02,090 --> 02:07:02,730
I was digging.

3692
02:07:02,990 --> 02:07:04,990
You just stood in front of the hitbox.

3693
02:07:05,950 --> 02:07:06,830
That's why...

3694
02:07:06,830 --> 02:07:07,790
You stood in front of the hitbox.

3695
02:07:07,850 --> 02:07:08,550
I didn't move.

3696
02:07:08,650 --> 02:07:09,750
I literally just left click.

3697
02:07:09,850 --> 02:07:10,590
I didn't move.

3698
02:07:10,690 --> 02:07:12,570
That's why I didn't attack this audience.

3699
02:07:12,610 --> 02:07:13,630
I didn't move.

3700
02:07:15,110 --> 02:07:15,510
Okay.

3701
02:07:16,970 --> 02:07:17,850
Where are we at?

3702
02:07:18,050 --> 02:07:19,170
We're at negative 29.

3703
02:07:20,570 --> 02:07:20,810
Hey.

3704
02:07:20,810 --> 02:07:23,310
I don't get an extra one.

3705
02:07:23,370 --> 02:07:25,370
I don't get an extra one.

3706
02:07:25,370 --> 02:07:28,190
Why are you so scared?

3707
02:07:28,890 --> 02:07:31,710
Why are you so scared?

3708
02:07:32,470 --> 02:07:33,530
Why are you so scared?

3709
02:07:33,530 --> 02:07:34,150
Jump down.

3710
02:07:34,270 --> 02:07:34,730
Jump down.

3711
02:07:34,850 --> 02:07:35,190
Come on.

3712
02:07:35,470 --> 02:07:36,010
What are you doing?

3713
02:07:36,090 --> 02:07:36,610
What happened?

3714
02:07:36,730 --> 02:07:38,570
I thought you wanted to...

3715
02:07:38,570 --> 02:07:40,410
You're such a fucker.

3716
02:07:40,650 --> 02:07:42,690
You're actually such a...

3717
02:07:42,690 --> 02:07:45,170
You're such a fucker.

3718
02:07:45,430 --> 02:07:49,290
I hope it is a hole and we have to do this all over again.

3719
02:07:49,290 --> 02:07:50,310
I hope...

3720
02:07:50,310 --> 02:07:51,750
I hope it's a hole.

3721
02:07:51,870 --> 02:07:54,410
I hope it's a fucking hole.

3722
02:08:01,930 --> 02:08:05,190
I hope it's a hole and then we actually dig to lava.

3723
02:08:05,570 --> 02:08:06,370
We're at negative 50.

3724
02:08:06,870 --> 02:08:07,590
Oh shit, are we?

3725
02:08:08,030 --> 02:08:10,430
Oh shit, we went too far.

3726
02:08:11,990 --> 02:08:12,950
No, we're good.

3727
02:08:13,590 --> 02:08:15,490
No, now I'm negative 50.

3728
02:08:16,270 --> 02:08:18,470
It's not exactly negative 50.

3729
02:08:18,470 --> 02:08:20,010
Yes, it is.

3730
02:08:20,570 --> 02:08:21,610
That's the whole point.

3731
02:08:21,810 --> 02:08:22,870
That's the whole point, yeah.

3732
02:08:23,110 --> 02:08:24,170
Oh no.

3733
02:08:24,690 --> 02:08:25,550
What happened?

3734
02:08:28,870 --> 02:08:29,750
There might...

3735
02:08:30,290 --> 02:08:31,170
What happened?

3736
02:08:31,770 --> 02:08:33,990
Okay, we need to do this one together.

3737
02:08:34,150 --> 02:08:35,010
We need to do this one together.

3738
02:08:35,090 --> 02:08:35,210
Why?

3739
02:08:37,570 --> 02:08:38,910
It's a mine shaft.

3740
02:08:39,450 --> 02:08:42,810
Oh my God, okay.

3741
02:08:42,850 --> 02:08:44,610
Let me make staircases real fast.

3742
02:08:48,750 --> 02:08:49,250
Yeah.

3743
02:08:49,670 --> 02:08:52,730
We gotta actually work together here.

3744
02:08:52,850 --> 02:08:54,030
Oh my God, okay.

3745
02:08:54,090 --> 02:08:55,470
We're gonna die in that mine shaft.

3746
02:08:55,710 --> 02:08:56,130
No, we're not.

3747
02:08:56,330 --> 02:08:59,030
We're gonna die in this mine shaft.

3748
02:08:59,310 --> 02:09:01,010
I fucking believe in our deaths.

3749
02:09:01,850 --> 02:09:03,410
We need redstone?

3750
02:09:04,390 --> 02:09:04,690
No.

3751
02:09:05,970 --> 02:09:06,470
Okay.

3752
02:09:08,270 --> 02:09:09,850
I'm never gonna find a dog in mine.

3753
02:09:10,070 --> 02:09:10,830
Do you have a good sword?

3754
02:09:11,030 --> 02:09:12,690
I have an iron sword, yeah.

3755
02:09:13,810 --> 02:09:15,530
Alright, let's go.

3756
02:09:17,690 --> 02:09:18,770
And let's loot.

3757
02:09:19,350 --> 02:09:19,750
Alright.

3758
02:09:20,310 --> 02:09:21,430
Do you want me to come with you?

3759
02:09:21,990 --> 02:09:23,290
Yeah, no, we gotta stick together.

3760
02:09:24,070 --> 02:09:25,610
We gotta watch each other's backs.

3761
02:09:26,250 --> 02:09:27,130
We gotta watch each other's backs.

3762
02:09:27,130 --> 02:09:28,110
You're scared.

3763
02:09:29,530 --> 02:09:30,330
Um, maybe.

3764
02:09:31,250 --> 02:09:33,950
I like how you're saying, yeah, we gotta work together and you disappeared.

3765
02:09:34,450 --> 02:09:35,110
Wait, wait a minute.

3766
02:09:35,910 --> 02:09:37,970
You gotta keep up with me.

3767
02:09:38,990 --> 02:09:40,670
I'm trying to put torches for us.

3768
02:09:41,150 --> 02:09:42,650
Oh, I got a lot of that.

3769
02:09:42,670 --> 02:09:43,310
Oh, there's some iron.

3770
02:09:43,310 --> 02:09:44,750
Yeah, there's iron right here, nice.

3771
02:09:45,990 --> 02:09:46,930
Um, I'll get rid of that.

3772
02:09:47,150 --> 02:09:48,730
I'll keep the little berries for food.

3773
02:09:49,030 --> 02:09:50,250
I'm gonna name time.

3774
02:09:51,230 --> 02:09:53,250
I'm putting some stuff away from this area.

3775
02:09:54,550 --> 02:09:55,770
Uh, you know what?

3776
02:09:55,850 --> 02:09:58,270
Since we're here, we have to go back to the same area anyway.

3777
02:09:58,350 --> 02:09:59,710
I'm gonna put a furnace here.

3778
02:10:00,210 --> 02:10:00,510
Okay.

3779
02:10:00,650 --> 02:10:01,850
And start making some stuff.

3780
02:10:03,170 --> 02:10:03,510
Alright.

3781
02:10:04,490 --> 02:10:05,870
Oh, hey, nice.

3782
02:10:07,950 --> 02:10:09,090
Oh, wait, gold.

3783
02:10:09,210 --> 02:10:09,930
We don't need gold.

3784
02:10:09,930 --> 02:10:10,890
Wait, we do need gold.

3785
02:10:11,090 --> 02:10:13,230
For the piggies.

3786
02:10:15,510 --> 02:10:18,490
Wait, why do people give gold to the piggies again?

3787
02:10:18,610 --> 02:10:19,750
What do you get?

3788
02:10:19,810 --> 02:10:23,130
You can trade with them and sometimes they give you potions.

3789
02:10:23,330 --> 02:10:24,690
We need like potions of fire.

3790
02:10:24,730 --> 02:10:25,110
Potions?

3791
02:10:25,330 --> 02:10:28,050
Can they give like ender pearls?

3792
02:10:28,270 --> 02:10:29,130
Yeah, they give pearls.

3793
02:10:29,750 --> 02:10:32,910
They can give pearls, they can give potions and then they can give...

3794
02:10:33,590 --> 02:10:34,750
Wait, did we come this way?

3795
02:10:35,210 --> 02:10:36,150
Oh, this is the way we came from.

3796
02:10:36,150 --> 02:10:38,650
Wait, there's one over here.

3797
02:10:39,930 --> 02:10:40,750
Right here.

3798
02:10:42,910 --> 02:10:44,370
Yeah, we gotta get down here.

3799
02:10:44,650 --> 02:10:44,890
Cool.

3800
02:10:46,210 --> 02:10:47,630
You could make a staircase.

3801
02:10:48,970 --> 02:10:49,950
Yeah, but...

3802
02:10:49,950 --> 02:10:50,630
But what?

3803
02:10:50,710 --> 02:10:50,930
Yeah?

3804
02:10:51,830 --> 02:10:52,570
Why didn't you?

3805
02:10:53,130 --> 02:10:55,110
I wanted to do it the cool way.

3806
02:10:56,170 --> 02:10:57,050
The harder way?

3807
02:10:57,750 --> 02:10:59,410
You mean the harder way?

3808
02:10:59,850 --> 02:11:00,850
The cooler way?

3809
02:11:01,390 --> 02:11:02,490
The harder way.

3810
02:11:02,490 --> 02:11:03,670
The cool way.

3811
02:11:04,070 --> 02:11:05,910
Where I look cool, like I'm fearless.

3812
02:11:06,110 --> 02:11:07,570
Chat, did you think she looked cool?

3813
02:11:08,330 --> 02:11:08,670
Yeah!

3814
02:11:12,930 --> 02:11:14,210
Did she look cool?

3815
02:11:14,270 --> 02:11:15,330
Just jumping down?

3816
02:11:16,050 --> 02:11:16,430
Yeah!

3817
02:11:18,430 --> 02:11:19,890
She looked so...

3818
02:11:19,890 --> 02:11:22,490
Oh no, there's a spider!

3819
02:11:22,670 --> 02:11:23,610
She looked so cool!

3820
02:11:24,030 --> 02:11:25,350
Wait, where are you, Doki?

3821
02:11:26,070 --> 02:11:27,390
I went up.

3822
02:11:27,890 --> 02:11:30,490
This is the entrance to the mineshaft.

3823
02:11:31,270 --> 02:11:32,150
The coolest.

3824
02:11:33,590 --> 02:11:34,470
Yeah, see?

3825
02:11:34,810 --> 02:11:35,850
I think I look cool.

3826
02:11:36,430 --> 02:11:37,690
Oh, maybe that's the spider I'm hearing.

3827
02:11:38,010 --> 02:11:38,450
Diamond!

3828
02:11:42,690 --> 02:11:44,490
Let's see if there's more...

3829
02:11:47,970 --> 02:11:50,730
Congratulations on your one diamond.

3830
02:11:50,910 --> 02:11:51,850
You needed that.

3831
02:11:52,830 --> 02:11:54,070
Oh wait, I ran out of torches.

3832
02:11:54,610 --> 02:11:55,930
Two diamonds, actually.

3833
02:11:57,670 --> 02:11:59,070
Wait, why do I have two chests?

3834
02:11:59,070 --> 02:12:00,890
Did I accidentally grab your chest?

3835
02:12:01,730 --> 02:12:02,770
You grabbed my chest?

3836
02:12:02,850 --> 02:12:03,050
Yeah.

3837
02:12:03,250 --> 02:12:04,150
Oh sorry, there's none.

3838
02:12:05,250 --> 02:12:05,670
I forgot.

3839
02:12:06,030 --> 02:12:07,510
I forgot you got nerfed.

3840
02:12:09,450 --> 02:12:10,370
Says you!

3841
02:12:11,270 --> 02:12:12,170
Oh my god!

3842
02:12:12,350 --> 02:12:14,230
Calling the kettle black?

3843
02:12:14,430 --> 02:12:15,250
For real?

3844
02:12:17,010 --> 02:12:18,230
Says you!

3845
02:12:20,790 --> 02:12:24,230
I remember when somebody was spamming Doki.

3846
02:12:24,290 --> 02:12:26,070
Laughing at Doki board.

3847
02:12:26,070 --> 02:12:28,010
I fucking remembered.

3848
02:12:28,310 --> 02:12:32,050
You know, someone at a fan meet gave me a cutting board.

3849
02:12:32,290 --> 02:12:34,030
Literally with your face drawn on it.

3850
02:12:34,050 --> 02:12:35,310
Wait, what?!

3851
02:12:36,310 --> 02:12:38,770
And the letter said, don't tell Doki.

3852
02:12:38,950 --> 02:12:39,710
But you know what?

3853
02:12:40,150 --> 02:12:40,970
I think I will!

3854
02:12:41,210 --> 02:12:42,430
But you told!

3855
02:12:43,710 --> 02:12:45,310
Yeah, I think I will!

3856
02:12:45,590 --> 02:12:47,410
Because it's my ammunition now.

3857
02:12:47,930 --> 02:12:49,390
You can't trust her, guys.

3858
02:12:49,490 --> 02:12:51,030
You can't trust her, guys.

3859
02:12:51,350 --> 02:12:52,470
Look at that, she told.

3860
02:12:52,470 --> 02:12:53,390
Where'd you go?

3861
02:12:53,910 --> 02:12:54,590
I don't fucking know!

3862
02:12:54,990 --> 02:12:57,050
Says the guy who owns an actual...

3863
02:12:57,050 --> 02:12:59,910
Why did you give it to Mint and not me?

3864
02:13:02,730 --> 02:13:04,990
That's the thing I'm wondering about.

3865
02:13:05,130 --> 02:13:06,830
Why did you give it to her?

3866
02:13:07,110 --> 02:13:09,530
If it has my face on it?

3867
02:13:10,290 --> 02:13:11,310
I don't know.

3868
02:13:12,070 --> 02:13:13,810
Control your words, you goons!

3869
02:13:16,090 --> 02:13:17,850
Was that a mending book?

3870
02:13:17,930 --> 02:13:19,410
Oh yeah, we need to do...

3871
02:13:19,410 --> 02:13:21,830
Like, actual things, don't we?

3872
02:13:22,550 --> 02:13:23,390
No, sweeping it.

3873
02:13:23,470 --> 02:13:24,550
Actually, this might be good to have.

3874
02:13:25,230 --> 02:13:26,150
Where'd you go?

3875
02:13:26,230 --> 02:13:26,910
I'm scared!

3876
02:13:28,170 --> 02:13:28,850
I don't know, actually.

3877
02:13:28,870 --> 02:13:29,710
I'm all by myself!

3878
02:13:30,230 --> 02:13:32,410
Actually, I think I fucked up.

3879
02:13:32,890 --> 02:13:34,450
What do you mean you fucked up?

3880
02:13:34,470 --> 02:13:36,010
I don't know where I am!

3881
02:13:36,090 --> 02:13:39,010
Where can I go even deeper?

3882
02:13:39,490 --> 02:13:40,650
No, don't go deeper!

3883
02:13:43,750 --> 02:13:44,630
I'm scared!

3884
02:13:44,870 --> 02:13:46,390
What happened to sticking together?

3885
02:13:46,390 --> 02:13:48,490
I don't know, you walked off the other way.

3886
02:13:48,590 --> 02:13:49,210
Oh, I see you.

3887
02:13:51,130 --> 02:13:52,590
Oh, let's go down here then.

3888
02:13:53,670 --> 02:13:54,210
No, I went there.

3889
02:13:54,310 --> 02:13:55,910
I went all the way... I explored all that.

3890
02:13:55,970 --> 02:13:56,670
Oh, all of it?

3891
02:13:56,730 --> 02:13:56,950
Okay.

3892
02:13:57,410 --> 02:13:59,010
Did you explore all of this way?

3893
02:13:59,830 --> 02:14:00,810
I mean, there's torches here.

3894
02:14:01,610 --> 02:14:03,830
I didn't go any further than this though.

3895
02:14:05,110 --> 02:14:05,470
Okay.

3896
02:14:06,850 --> 02:14:08,650
We gotta find our original way back.

3897
02:14:08,670 --> 02:14:09,750
Because I put a furnace there.

3898
02:14:11,330 --> 02:14:12,510
I know where to go.

3899
02:14:12,650 --> 02:14:15,070
I would like to have my furnace back.

3900
02:14:15,070 --> 02:14:17,170
I have another furnace.

3901
02:14:17,410 --> 02:14:18,830
I know, but I put furnaces.

3902
02:14:19,030 --> 02:14:20,670
I was making stuff from there.

3903
02:14:21,190 --> 02:14:23,030
There's a spider in here.

3904
02:14:23,390 --> 02:14:24,170
I can hear him.

3905
02:14:24,250 --> 02:14:24,910
Alright, let's go.

3906
02:14:30,310 --> 02:14:32,910
It must be like a... what is it called?

3907
02:14:33,410 --> 02:14:34,310
A spawner then.

3908
02:14:35,270 --> 02:14:36,190
Oh my god, that's a bat.

3909
02:14:37,070 --> 02:14:38,590
Oh, I'm out of torches.

3910
02:14:39,530 --> 02:14:41,130
I've been out of torches for a while.

3911
02:14:41,850 --> 02:14:42,230
What?

3912
02:14:42,390 --> 02:14:42,970
Why did you do something?

3913
02:14:42,970 --> 02:14:44,570
Yeah, but I've been...

3914
02:14:44,570 --> 02:14:46,470
I've been using my one torch to light my way.

3915
02:14:48,330 --> 02:14:49,770
I have more torches.

3916
02:14:51,910 --> 02:14:53,150
Where am I?

3917
02:14:54,930 --> 02:14:55,810
Oh, diamond!

3918
02:14:58,570 --> 02:15:00,510
Actually, where am I?

3919
02:15:02,050 --> 02:15:02,990
Oh, diamond!

3920
02:15:05,330 --> 02:15:06,970
What is this role reversal here?

3921
02:15:06,970 --> 02:15:07,030
Wait.

3922
02:15:14,460 --> 02:15:18,220
I've waited for this moment for a long time.

3923
02:15:20,280 --> 02:15:21,720
Oh, there's a creeper over here.

3924
02:15:22,060 --> 02:15:22,640
You wanna get him?

3925
02:15:23,560 --> 02:15:23,860
Sure.

3926
02:15:25,700 --> 02:15:26,760
Hit and run.

3927
02:15:27,520 --> 02:15:29,180
I like how you ran so far.

3928
02:15:30,120 --> 02:15:31,960
Well, I'm giving you extra room.

3929
02:15:32,280 --> 02:15:35,160
Yeah, sure, sure.

3930
02:15:36,660 --> 02:15:37,840
Oh, I'm stuck.

3931
02:15:38,040 --> 02:15:39,580
I can't...

3932
02:15:40,360 --> 02:15:41,560
I hear a spider.

3933
02:15:41,760 --> 02:15:42,660
Yeah, I hear him.

3934
02:15:43,100 --> 02:15:44,680
I think he's like somewhere in here.

3935
02:15:44,780 --> 02:15:45,660
There's a spawner here.

3936
02:15:45,920 --> 02:15:46,260
Here, hold on.

3937
02:15:46,500 --> 02:15:48,700
Watch my back and I'll make more torches.

3938
02:15:48,840 --> 02:15:49,060
Alright.

3939
02:15:51,240 --> 02:15:52,140
Oh, nice.

3940
02:15:55,140 --> 02:15:57,420
I'm gonna start putting stuff away.

3941
02:15:57,780 --> 02:15:58,220
I'm right here.

3942
02:15:58,460 --> 02:15:59,720
What happened to watching my back?

3943
02:16:00,120 --> 02:16:01,080
Take some torches.

3944
02:16:01,080 --> 02:16:02,160
I was.

3945
02:16:02,760 --> 02:16:03,600
Take these.

3946
02:16:03,840 --> 02:16:04,440
Alright, nice.

3947
02:16:04,840 --> 02:16:07,960
Put that here.

3948
02:16:10,160 --> 02:16:11,300
Oh, what was in here?

3949
02:16:12,200 --> 02:16:14,660
I feel like we don't really need a torch or anything.

3950
02:16:18,760 --> 02:16:21,250
Oh my god, where the fuck...

3951
02:16:21,250 --> 02:16:23,350
I have five whole diamonds.

3952
02:16:24,230 --> 02:16:25,430
Only five?

3953
02:16:26,510 --> 02:16:29,810
Well, we don't have fortune pickaxes anymore.

3954
02:16:33,670 --> 02:16:34,670
This is bad.

3955
02:16:35,590 --> 02:16:36,490
I think if we...

3956
02:16:36,490 --> 02:16:39,230
If we mine to the left, we'll find the spawn...

3957
02:16:39,230 --> 02:16:39,830
Maybe it's here.

3958
02:16:39,970 --> 02:16:41,370
Maybe that's where the spiders are spawning.

3959
02:16:42,810 --> 02:16:44,490
The spawner is... Oh, yeah.

3960
02:16:45,510 --> 02:16:46,730
Oh, that's where I found diamonds.

3961
02:16:47,570 --> 02:16:48,090
To here?

3962
02:16:49,430 --> 02:16:51,130
Are we... No, we have gone down here.

3963
02:16:51,190 --> 02:16:51,850
See, there's a torch.

3964
02:16:52,750 --> 02:16:53,790
Wait, hold on.

3965
02:16:56,710 --> 02:16:58,870
Have we gone across before?

3966
02:16:59,490 --> 02:17:00,850
No, it doesn't look like it.

3967
02:17:00,850 --> 02:17:02,770
But I wanna check the...

3968
02:17:02,770 --> 02:17:03,450
Oh, hey, wait.

3969
02:17:03,570 --> 02:17:03,830
Look.

3970
02:17:05,870 --> 02:17:07,870
See, that's where the spiders are.

3971
02:17:08,410 --> 02:17:10,010
I don't know if we have gone down here.

3972
02:17:10,130 --> 02:17:10,730
I'm sure we have.

3973
02:17:10,730 --> 02:17:11,730
Look over here.

3974
02:17:13,410 --> 02:17:15,050
Look over here where I am.

3975
02:17:17,170 --> 02:17:18,570
Oh, what the fuck?

3976
02:17:18,910 --> 02:17:20,250
Where did he come from?

3977
02:17:20,530 --> 02:17:21,130
Over here.

3978
02:17:21,490 --> 02:17:22,550
What the fuck?

3979
02:17:24,070 --> 02:17:25,350
I didn't kill him though.

3980
02:17:25,390 --> 02:17:26,090
He's still down there.

3981
02:17:26,150 --> 02:17:26,690
That's fine.

3982
02:17:27,630 --> 02:17:29,210
Get your shields up.

3983
02:17:29,490 --> 02:17:30,170
What is he gonna do?

3984
02:17:30,230 --> 02:17:30,930
Climb up?

3985
02:17:33,290 --> 02:17:35,210
I'll be very impressed if he does that.

3986
02:17:36,730 --> 02:17:38,670
I'll be very impressed.

3987
02:17:38,790 --> 02:17:40,910
I still hear the spider, but I don't...

3988
02:17:40,910 --> 02:17:41,510
There's nothing here.

3989
02:17:42,690 --> 02:17:44,850
I'm pretty sure the spider is like...

3990
02:17:44,850 --> 02:17:45,930
Oh, there's a zombie here.

3991
02:17:46,510 --> 02:17:48,050
I hear a zombie too, yeah.

3992
02:17:48,230 --> 02:17:49,350
Yeah, I just killed him.

3993
02:17:50,130 --> 02:17:51,330
No, there's a different one.

3994
02:17:51,970 --> 02:17:53,310
Wait, I can actually go down?

3995
02:17:53,310 --> 02:17:53,890
Oh my god.

3996
02:17:53,890 --> 02:17:57,290
Did he climb up?

3997
02:17:57,670 --> 02:17:58,770
My turn.

3998
02:17:59,130 --> 02:17:59,930
Oh my god.

3999
02:18:00,590 --> 02:18:02,290
Where did he come from?

4000
02:18:03,750 --> 02:18:04,590
Wait, why are you laughing?

4001
02:18:04,590 --> 02:18:05,670
Oh, I found the spider.

4002
02:18:06,650 --> 02:18:09,310
He was guarding the diamonds.

4003
02:18:09,870 --> 02:18:11,170
All I'm saying is...

4004
02:18:11,170 --> 02:18:12,310
I have four now too.

4005
02:18:15,070 --> 02:18:16,370
Oh my god.

4006
02:18:16,530 --> 02:18:18,650
I have five, not four.

4007
02:18:18,890 --> 02:18:24,150
But you had to mine several times for five.

4008
02:18:25,270 --> 02:18:28,710
If this is a team effort, it doesn't matter how many we have as long as we...

4009
02:18:28,710 --> 02:18:32,290
I mined one square for that diamond.

4010
02:18:34,690 --> 02:18:36,130
I think there's more spider here.

4011
02:18:37,470 --> 02:18:38,530
Or... Oh yeah, there is.

4012
02:18:39,670 --> 02:18:40,090
Spider!

4013
02:18:42,550 --> 02:18:43,670
There's nothing here.

4014
02:18:44,410 --> 02:18:45,030
I got him.

4015
02:18:45,790 --> 02:18:47,190
Is this where the zombie was?

4016
02:18:47,530 --> 02:18:49,030
Alright, I think we...

4017
02:18:49,030 --> 02:18:50,610
We got all the mine...

4018
02:18:50,610 --> 02:18:52,370
I think we explored the mineshaft fully.

4019
02:18:52,850 --> 02:18:53,330
I'm pretty sure.

4020
02:18:54,670 --> 02:18:57,010
Wait, where are you?

4021
02:18:58,370 --> 02:18:59,890
I'm exploring the mineshaft.

4022
02:18:59,970 --> 02:19:00,970
Wait, where did you go?

4023
02:19:02,010 --> 02:19:02,550
Where are you?

4024
02:19:02,850 --> 02:19:03,370
I don't know.

4025
02:19:04,630 --> 02:19:05,770
Well, find me.

4026
02:19:06,550 --> 02:19:07,550
Oh, I see you.

4027
02:19:08,990 --> 02:19:10,410
How do I find you?

4028
02:19:11,110 --> 02:19:11,570
Oh my god.

4029
02:19:12,350 --> 02:19:13,750
Oh yeah, we haven't gotten here.

4030
02:19:14,270 --> 02:19:14,990
I'm gonna die.

4031
02:19:15,130 --> 02:19:15,950
Hold on, I gotta eat.

4032
02:19:15,950 --> 02:19:18,070
Why are you so close to dying?

4033
02:19:19,450 --> 02:19:20,810
We don't need gold.

4034
02:19:21,150 --> 02:19:21,890
Yes we do!

4035
02:19:22,150 --> 02:19:23,790
We can get enderpearls!

4036
02:19:24,010 --> 02:19:25,450
I swear, if we get...

4037
02:19:25,450 --> 02:19:27,330
I swear to god, if we like...

4038
02:19:27,330 --> 02:19:30,010
If this clutches our run, I'm gonna remember this.

4039
02:19:30,350 --> 02:19:30,650
I'm...

4040
02:19:32,650 --> 02:19:33,430
I'm gonna...

4041
02:19:33,430 --> 02:19:36,090
I'm gonna remember this if this fucking clutches our run.

4042
02:19:37,130 --> 02:19:38,210
You're gonna remember this?

4043
02:19:38,270 --> 02:19:39,350
Yeah, I'm gonna remember this.

4044
02:19:39,470 --> 02:19:40,730
You're gonna remember this?

4045
02:19:41,950 --> 02:19:43,990
English is not my first language, so you're...

4046
02:19:47,410 --> 02:19:48,690
It's not a first language thing.

4047
02:19:48,730 --> 02:19:50,030
It's literally a mumbling thing!

4048
02:19:51,130 --> 02:19:52,230
Remember mumbling this?

4049
02:19:52,390 --> 02:19:53,430
Remember mumbling this?

4050
02:19:53,890 --> 02:19:55,030
There's more over here, by the way.

4051
02:19:55,030 --> 02:19:57,010
English is my first language, by the way.

4052
02:20:01,450 --> 02:20:03,050
But it made you feel bad.

4053
02:20:04,230 --> 02:20:05,770
Not even a little bit.

4054
02:20:05,910 --> 02:20:06,530
Because of you.

4055
02:20:08,750 --> 02:20:10,350
Should we just strip mine here, then?

4056
02:20:10,730 --> 02:20:11,050
I guess.

4057
02:20:11,150 --> 02:20:12,410
No, I need to go back to the furnace.

4058
02:20:12,930 --> 02:20:13,770
Oh my god.

4059
02:20:13,950 --> 02:20:15,990
Forget about your furnace, I have two furnaces!

4060
02:20:16,430 --> 02:20:16,430
No!

4061
02:20:16,650 --> 02:20:18,510
But it had meat in it!

4062
02:20:19,450 --> 02:20:20,670
It had all the coal!

4063
02:20:21,030 --> 02:20:24,850
It had all of it in there!

4064
02:20:24,950 --> 02:20:25,750
Okay, fine, let's go back.

4065
02:20:27,710 --> 02:20:29,430
You said you knew how to go back!

4066
02:20:29,790 --> 02:20:30,810
Not from here.

4067
02:20:31,090 --> 02:20:31,790
Shit, I don't know.

4068
02:20:32,070 --> 02:20:33,850
Wait, I think I do know.

4069
02:20:34,870 --> 02:20:35,870
Okay, from down here.

4070
02:20:35,990 --> 02:20:38,290
You said we were gonna go back!

4071
02:20:38,470 --> 02:20:39,970
And I believed in you!

4072
02:20:40,650 --> 02:20:42,690
I don't actually know where you left it, though.

4073
02:20:42,690 --> 02:20:44,230
I don't know either.

4074
02:20:45,450 --> 02:20:47,350
What do you mean you don't know either?

4075
02:20:49,210 --> 02:20:51,090
Was it before the mineshaft?

4076
02:20:51,170 --> 02:20:52,930
Yeah, no, it was the mineshaft.

4077
02:20:52,990 --> 02:20:55,030
But it was the first mineshaft area.

4078
02:20:57,550 --> 02:20:58,390
Oh, there it is!

4079
02:20:58,630 --> 02:21:00,550
See, I told you!

4080
02:21:01,490 --> 02:21:03,470
Okay, now we can leave.

4081
02:21:05,210 --> 02:21:05,950
Oh yeah, two, right?

4082
02:21:06,070 --> 02:21:06,990
Okay, I'll just wait for you two.

4083
02:21:08,130 --> 02:21:10,690
Actually, let me...

4084
02:21:10,690 --> 02:21:11,590
I'm gonna put some stuff...

4085
02:21:11,590 --> 02:21:13,670
We don't need gunpowder, because then we don't need TNT, right?

4086
02:21:15,230 --> 02:21:15,970
I mean...

4087
02:21:16,510 --> 02:21:17,950
I guess technically not.

4088
02:21:18,070 --> 02:21:20,810
Unless we want to get netherite, but...

4089
02:21:20,810 --> 02:21:21,110
No.

4090
02:21:22,550 --> 02:21:23,670
That's too much work.

4091
02:21:23,770 --> 02:21:26,650
Do we need netherite to fucking fight the ender dragon?

4092
02:21:27,270 --> 02:21:28,770
We can just fight them with diamond!

4093
02:21:30,750 --> 02:21:31,790
Yeah, I guess so.

4094
02:21:32,390 --> 02:21:33,870
We can just do it with diamond.

4095
02:21:36,030 --> 02:21:37,310
How do you open a book?

4096
02:21:38,690 --> 02:21:39,490
What do you mean?

4097
02:21:40,050 --> 02:21:41,170
How do you open a book?

4098
02:21:41,590 --> 02:21:43,070
You need a thingy for it.

4099
02:21:43,190 --> 02:21:43,950
You need a thingy?

4100
02:21:44,270 --> 02:21:46,290
Yeah, like a library thing.

4101
02:21:46,470 --> 02:21:49,270
So you have to have a thingy to open...

4102
02:21:49,270 --> 02:21:50,230
To write in it too?

4103
02:21:51,070 --> 02:21:53,430
Yeah, you can't open it or do anything with it.

4104
02:21:53,470 --> 02:21:55,730
Oh my god, I knew I can't read.

4105
02:21:56,750 --> 02:21:58,390
I'll never be able to read.

4106
02:21:58,530 --> 02:22:00,050
Okay, let's go back downstairs and do the strip mining.

4107
02:22:00,070 --> 02:22:01,190
Oh my god, you're scaring me!

4108
02:22:07,430 --> 02:22:08,930
Oh, this is where you got your diamond.

4109
02:22:09,070 --> 02:22:11,250
Well, let's go keep... This is a good diamond area then.

4110
02:22:11,330 --> 02:22:12,490
Yeah, yeah, so we just strip mine.

4111
02:22:13,050 --> 02:22:13,710
Strip mine.

4112
02:22:14,370 --> 02:22:15,170
Alright, nice.

4113
02:22:17,470 --> 02:22:18,310
This is it.

4114
02:22:18,670 --> 02:22:21,070
This is where we're gonna find all the diamonds.

4115
02:22:21,450 --> 02:22:23,690
We're gonna find diamond, we're gonna be so...

4116
02:22:23,690 --> 02:22:25,950
We're gonna be so rich and everything.

4117
02:22:26,090 --> 02:22:26,530
You know what?

4118
02:22:26,650 --> 02:22:31,390
I'm gonna use that diamond I have now...

4119
02:22:31,390 --> 02:22:31,590
I'm gonna use that diamond I have now...

4120
02:22:31,590 --> 02:22:33,410
And craft a diamond pickaxe.

4121
02:22:33,670 --> 02:22:34,250
I'm gonna do it.

4122
02:22:34,870 --> 02:22:35,990
That's such a waste.

4123
02:22:36,350 --> 02:22:37,110
What do you mean?

4124
02:22:37,230 --> 02:22:38,030
We literally...

4125
02:22:38,030 --> 02:22:38,990
That's the whole point.

4126
02:22:39,450 --> 02:22:42,090
The point is to have the diamond armor.

4127
02:22:42,190 --> 02:22:43,850
Why don't we just keep using the iron?

4128
02:22:48,830 --> 02:22:50,030
You crafted it, didn't you?

4129
02:23:11,680 --> 02:23:12,600
It's important!

4130
02:23:13,360 --> 02:23:14,680
It's gonna do...

4131
02:23:14,680 --> 02:23:16,860
It's gonna do so well.

4132
02:23:17,100 --> 02:23:18,320
It's gonna do so well.

4133
02:23:18,540 --> 02:23:21,680
I'm gonna find the remaining diamonds for you.

4134
02:23:21,880 --> 02:23:22,700
You'll see.

4135
02:23:22,860 --> 02:23:24,120
You're gonna see.

4136
02:23:24,320 --> 02:23:25,640
You'll see.

4137
02:23:25,880 --> 02:23:26,600
You'll see.

4138
02:23:27,640 --> 02:23:28,980
You're gonna see.

4139
02:23:30,420 --> 02:23:32,620
I'm gonna prove you wrong.

4140
02:23:34,760 --> 02:23:36,280
Prove me wrong.

4141
02:23:37,440 --> 02:23:38,500
You'll see.

4142
02:23:39,240 --> 02:23:41,340
I'm gonna show you all.

4143
02:23:41,800 --> 02:23:43,380
Show you all.

4144
02:23:45,280 --> 02:23:47,440
Didn't they add a new enemy?

4145
02:23:48,420 --> 02:23:49,380
They did?

4146
02:23:49,700 --> 02:23:50,960
No, they didn't.

4147
02:23:51,020 --> 02:23:51,900
I thought they did.

4148
02:23:51,920 --> 02:23:52,520
What did they add?

4149
02:23:53,560 --> 02:23:54,900
I don't remember what it's called.

4150
02:23:59,000 --> 02:23:59,960
I don't...

4151
02:23:59,960 --> 02:24:00,960
Chat, what was it called?

4152
02:24:02,200 --> 02:24:04,000
Oh, it's a new biome?

4153
02:24:04,360 --> 02:24:06,260
Yeah, like a slenderman thing, right?

4154
02:24:06,540 --> 02:24:06,880
What?

4155
02:24:09,120 --> 02:24:11,020
The fuck are you talking about?

4156
02:24:11,640 --> 02:24:12,460
Not the warden.

4157
02:24:12,500 --> 02:24:12,960
The creaking?

4158
02:24:14,880 --> 02:24:15,400
Yeah.

4159
02:24:15,560 --> 02:24:16,180
Is it in this?

4160
02:24:16,400 --> 02:24:19,100
A certain cave biome.

4161
02:24:19,860 --> 02:24:22,220
Wait, is it in this one?

4162
02:24:23,220 --> 02:24:24,620
What's this one?

4163
02:24:25,160 --> 02:24:26,260
Is it in this snapshot?

4164
02:24:27,200 --> 02:24:27,980
Or like...

4165
02:24:31,100 --> 02:24:32,080
Deep dark!

4166
02:24:32,160 --> 02:24:33,620
You got the deep dark?

4167
02:24:33,920 --> 02:24:35,300
I'm in the deep dark!

4168
02:24:35,560 --> 02:24:38,440
How the fuck did you find the deep dark?

4169
02:24:38,640 --> 02:24:39,500
It took us...

4170
02:24:42,160 --> 02:24:42,980
Well, I don't know.

4171
02:24:43,080 --> 02:24:44,220
It might not be a...

4172
02:24:44,220 --> 02:24:45,640
It might not be a city.

4173
02:24:46,340 --> 02:24:46,880
Wait, no.

4174
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:48,240
You can tell if it's a city.

4175
02:24:48,680 --> 02:24:49,020
F3.

4176
02:24:49,220 --> 02:24:50,100
It tells you the biome.

4177
02:24:50,560 --> 02:24:52,620
No, it says my biome is deep dark.

4178
02:24:53,280 --> 02:24:53,620
Oh.

4179
02:24:54,160 --> 02:24:55,700
If you dig down, that means we're in it.

4180
02:25:00,090 --> 02:25:01,290
Are you gonna dig down?

4181
02:25:01,930 --> 02:25:02,750
Should I dig down?

4182
02:25:04,290 --> 02:25:04,630
Okay.

4183
02:25:04,990 --> 02:25:05,790
Are you gonna do it?

4184
02:25:05,870 --> 02:25:08,210
If we find a warden, we are actually for sure in it.

4185
02:25:08,210 --> 02:25:08,830
What do you mean, we?

4186
02:25:10,690 --> 02:25:11,590
Oh, wait.

4187
02:25:11,670 --> 02:25:12,530
I'm at bedrock.

4188
02:25:12,650 --> 02:25:13,710
Wait, I'm at bedrock too.

4189
02:25:13,830 --> 02:25:14,930
I've been digging bedrock.

4190
02:25:15,890 --> 02:25:18,150
I was trying to dig bedrock.

4191
02:25:18,670 --> 02:25:20,430
I couldn't tell.

4192
02:25:20,710 --> 02:25:23,490
I couldn't tell that I was bedrock.

4193
02:25:24,890 --> 02:25:28,370
I was like, wow, this is some hard ass rock right here.

4194
02:25:29,310 --> 02:25:31,290
You're wasting your...

4195
02:25:31,950 --> 02:25:34,210
Your newly diamond pickaxe.

4196
02:25:35,110 --> 02:25:39,210
I was like, wow, this rock is so hard to dig.

4197
02:25:39,850 --> 02:25:41,070
This is really deep dark.

4198
02:25:41,150 --> 02:25:42,310
There's no skulk at all.

4199
02:25:43,570 --> 02:25:45,190
Maybe I dig down or above.

4200
02:25:45,410 --> 02:25:46,390
Maybe it's above us.

4201
02:25:46,610 --> 02:25:47,610
Maybe it's above us.

4202
02:25:47,630 --> 02:25:48,410
Yeah, I think it is.

4203
02:25:48,430 --> 02:25:50,510
Because we're too far deep for...

4204
02:25:50,510 --> 02:25:52,670
We're too far deep for it to be.

4205
02:25:53,290 --> 02:25:54,850
Yeah, it doesn't matter for us.

4206
02:25:55,030 --> 02:25:56,270
Yeah, we don't need...

4207
02:25:57,530 --> 02:25:59,630
I don't think we need it, so...

4208
02:25:59,630 --> 02:26:03,230
I don't think there was anything there that requires us to...

4209
02:26:04,990 --> 02:26:05,470
To...

4210
02:26:05,470 --> 02:26:05,950
What was it?

4211
02:26:06,030 --> 02:26:06,830
To use the deep dark.

4212
02:26:06,950 --> 02:26:10,210
It would probably just be a flex to say that we survived the deep dark.

4213
02:26:10,350 --> 02:26:11,570
Technically, I'm surviving the deep dark right now.

4214
02:26:11,570 --> 02:26:13,470
Survive the deep dark in hardcore.

4215
02:26:14,010 --> 02:26:14,770
I'm surviving...

4216
02:26:14,770 --> 02:26:15,470
Oh, diamond.

4217
02:26:18,150 --> 02:26:19,110
Oh, diamond.

4218
02:26:19,490 --> 02:26:19,970
Whoa.

4219
02:26:20,510 --> 02:26:21,970
Hey, I got diamond too.

4220
02:26:22,170 --> 02:26:23,630
See, I told you the investment.

4221
02:26:25,390 --> 02:26:26,210
Like, two.

4222
02:26:26,690 --> 02:26:28,590
Yeah, how many did you get?

4223
02:26:28,870 --> 02:26:30,190
I got like five.

4224
02:26:30,190 --> 02:26:30,950
Oh, okay.

4225
02:26:31,390 --> 02:26:32,770
I'm at eleven now.

4226
02:26:32,890 --> 02:26:33,590
I have eleven diamonds.

4227
02:26:33,870 --> 02:26:34,410
Oh, okay.

4228
02:26:35,010 --> 02:26:38,230
I mean, I got my diamond pickaxe.

4229
02:26:40,290 --> 02:26:42,470
Actually, I think we do need that for like obsidian.

4230
02:26:43,130 --> 02:26:43,510
Yeah.

4231
02:26:43,730 --> 02:26:44,430
Oh, yeah?

4232
02:26:44,630 --> 02:26:46,450
Oh, so my investment was like...

4233
02:26:46,450 --> 02:26:46,970
Corrected.

4234
02:26:48,090 --> 02:26:48,490
Barely.

4235
02:26:48,590 --> 02:26:49,850
I mean, we could have found obsidian.

4236
02:26:51,290 --> 02:26:54,010
We could have also like made it without the obsidian.

4237
02:26:54,250 --> 02:26:55,390
Sure, sure, sure.

4238
02:26:56,310 --> 02:26:57,250
Are you crying?

4239
02:26:57,370 --> 02:26:57,730
Are you okay?

4240
02:26:57,730 --> 02:26:58,070
Oh, man.

4241
02:26:59,130 --> 02:27:00,230
Why would I be crying?

4242
02:27:00,350 --> 02:27:01,950
I have my diamond pickaxe.

4243
02:27:02,110 --> 02:27:03,290
My good investment.

4244
02:27:07,150 --> 02:27:08,430
Wait, we could just use the bucket.

4245
02:27:08,590 --> 02:27:09,770
Wait, that's actually smart.

4246
02:27:09,770 --> 02:27:10,530
That's what I'm saying.

4247
02:27:10,690 --> 02:27:12,950
You use the bucket to like make it without...

4248
02:27:12,950 --> 02:27:14,070
Yeah, do you know how to do it?

4249
02:27:14,110 --> 02:27:14,870
Do you know how to do it?

4250
02:27:15,450 --> 02:27:16,750
I actually don't know how.

4251
02:27:16,810 --> 02:27:17,570
Yeah, exactly.

4252
02:27:20,950 --> 02:27:22,950
I actually think I'm stupid with that.

4253
02:27:23,270 --> 02:27:24,210
I never looked it up.

4254
02:27:24,770 --> 02:27:27,010
Wait, your video tutorial didn't tell you how to?

4255
02:27:27,650 --> 02:27:27,970
No.

4256
02:27:28,990 --> 02:27:30,710
I told you, they don't hold your hand.

4257
02:27:30,850 --> 02:27:32,670
They're like, you're gonna figure this out.

4258
02:27:32,770 --> 02:27:34,910
We'll just give you hints on what to do.

4259
02:27:36,410 --> 02:27:38,350
Wait, I need to go up.

4260
02:27:38,790 --> 02:27:39,510
Let's see.

4261
02:27:40,810 --> 02:27:42,890
How the turns of tables, right?

4262
02:27:42,970 --> 02:27:44,850
I feel like we need to be at...

4263
02:27:44,850 --> 02:27:46,810
Isn't 54 like the optimal?

4264
02:27:48,110 --> 02:27:49,090
I don't know.

4265
02:27:49,250 --> 02:27:50,290
I'm at negative 58.

4266
02:27:50,950 --> 02:27:51,970
You're at 58?

4267
02:27:51,970 --> 02:27:53,870
Is that almost better?

4268
02:27:55,190 --> 02:27:55,790
Yeah.

4269
02:27:58,410 --> 02:27:59,950
This sounds like Cope, huh?

4270
02:27:59,990 --> 02:28:01,950
Oh, I don't think I'm at the right level.

4271
02:28:03,830 --> 02:28:05,610
I'm gonna remember this.

4272
02:28:07,250 --> 02:28:08,450
I have!

4273
02:28:08,870 --> 02:28:11,050
I have remembered it!

4274
02:28:11,050 --> 02:28:13,970
These people are gonna remember what you...

4275
02:28:17,190 --> 02:28:19,530
We have remembered it!

4276
02:28:19,530 --> 02:28:22,090
At least mine went viral.

4277
02:28:27,750 --> 02:28:31,130
People always remember the first time, not the second.

4278
02:28:35,050 --> 02:28:36,850
This is my first time.

4279
02:28:47,590 --> 02:28:49,230
It's gonna haunt you for years.

4280
02:28:49,250 --> 02:28:53,230
How many diamonds do we need, guys, for a full armor set?

4281
02:28:57,070 --> 02:28:57,810
How many?

4282
02:28:58,630 --> 02:29:00,290
I'm surprised I haven't hit any of them.

4283
02:29:00,470 --> 02:29:01,630
Oh, I hate this eerie sound.

4284
02:29:01,730 --> 02:29:02,190
It's so creepy.

4285
02:29:03,370 --> 02:29:03,730
33?

4286
02:29:03,730 --> 02:29:06,970
I don't feel like I've been digging for the rest of my life.

4287
02:29:08,050 --> 02:29:09,330
We need 30.

4288
02:29:09,570 --> 02:29:10,650
Someone says 24.

4289
02:29:11,270 --> 02:29:13,410
Okay, people are gaslighting me.

4290
02:29:16,450 --> 02:29:22,830
You're whispered gaslighting you, but my dragoons instantly told me the correct amount.

4291
02:29:23,570 --> 02:29:25,930
Oh, but we also need a sword.

4292
02:29:26,370 --> 02:29:28,110
I think they meant it with also the sword.

4293
02:29:29,630 --> 02:29:30,190
Right?

4294
02:29:30,310 --> 02:29:31,430
We need the sword too.

4295
02:29:35,480 --> 02:29:35,760
Is that lava?

4296
02:29:41,480 --> 02:29:45,420
No, that was several people!

4297
02:29:46,660 --> 02:29:49,620
There were several dragoons that said it!

4298
02:29:50,020 --> 02:29:51,420
Oh, you don't even see my chat.

4299
02:29:51,580 --> 02:29:54,120
How are you gaslighting me when you don't even see my chat?

4300
02:29:55,520 --> 02:29:57,000
Wait, do you have a crafting table?

4301
02:29:57,340 --> 02:29:57,860
Yeah, I do.

4302
02:29:58,000 --> 02:29:58,400
I have two.

4303
02:29:59,180 --> 02:29:59,800
Can I have one?

4304
02:29:59,860 --> 02:30:00,780
Oh, I think you stole mine.

4305
02:30:01,220 --> 02:30:02,080
I didn't steal it.

4306
02:30:02,120 --> 02:30:03,140
You lost yours.

4307
02:30:03,740 --> 02:30:05,120
I'm running back to you.

4308
02:30:05,120 --> 02:30:06,100
I don't even know where I am.

4309
02:30:06,100 --> 02:30:06,780
How far are you?

4310
02:30:07,460 --> 02:30:09,480
You're going down one hole, right?

4311
02:30:09,680 --> 02:30:10,860
You're just going down a single hole?

4312
02:30:11,080 --> 02:30:14,240
Did you not hear when I said I hit bedrock?

4313
02:30:15,780 --> 02:30:17,740
You can keep going!

4314
02:30:18,180 --> 02:30:19,160
No, you can't!

4315
02:30:19,640 --> 02:30:21,080
I'm just going straight!

4316
02:30:22,460 --> 02:30:24,060
Is that incapable of you?

4317
02:30:24,120 --> 02:30:25,840
Are you incapable of going straight?

4318
02:30:26,700 --> 02:30:27,320
Oh, hey, look.

4319
02:30:27,400 --> 02:30:28,940
I found...

4320
02:30:28,940 --> 02:30:29,700
Whoa!

4321
02:30:32,420 --> 02:30:34,680
I found five diamonds.

4322
02:30:35,140 --> 02:30:36,280
That's right.

4323
02:30:36,900 --> 02:30:37,420
Five.

4324
02:30:38,900 --> 02:30:39,260
No.

4325
02:30:40,670 --> 02:30:42,340
No, you gotta find me first.

4326
02:30:42,840 --> 02:30:44,220
I'm literally right behind you.

4327
02:30:45,020 --> 02:30:45,340
Oh, hey.

4328
02:30:48,490 --> 02:30:51,440
You stupid crafting table.

4329
02:30:52,700 --> 02:30:57,860
That was a stack of six diamonds?

4330
02:30:58,940 --> 02:30:59,560
Look at that.

4331
02:30:59,720 --> 02:31:00,820
How many do you have?

4332
02:31:02,640 --> 02:31:03,160
Seven.

4333
02:31:03,660 --> 02:31:08,440
And if I include the three diamonds I used to make my diamond pickaxe...

4334
02:31:08,980 --> 02:31:10,540
That would be like ten.

4335
02:31:11,980 --> 02:31:12,320
Yeah.

4336
02:31:12,700 --> 02:31:14,000
That's rookies numbers.

4337
02:31:14,160 --> 02:31:14,720
Yeah, what do you have?

4338
02:31:14,780 --> 02:31:15,200
Eleven?

4339
02:31:15,420 --> 02:31:17,200
Like the plus one that's apparently better?

4340
02:31:18,200 --> 02:31:19,240
Yeah, eleven.

4341
02:31:20,260 --> 02:31:20,960
I didn't take it?

4342
02:31:22,340 --> 02:31:23,440
I didn't take it.

4343
02:31:24,340 --> 02:31:26,000
See, you lost yours.

4344
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:27,200
And you're like...

4345
02:31:28,320 --> 02:31:33,520
You stole my crafting table when you didn't even take your crafting table in the first place.

4346
02:31:33,880 --> 02:31:34,740
I can't see.

4347
02:31:34,900 --> 02:31:36,380
You don't put any torches down.

4348
02:31:36,460 --> 02:31:37,500
It's pitch black down here.

4349
02:31:37,800 --> 02:31:39,340
Yeah, I don't need torches.

4350
02:31:39,480 --> 02:31:41,560
I literally have a torch in my hand to light the way.

4351
02:31:42,060 --> 02:31:46,420
Why waste resources when I can just light the way with my torches in my hand?

4352
02:31:46,860 --> 02:31:49,460
I can't wait for a creeper to spawn right up behind you.

4353
02:31:53,240 --> 02:31:53,800
Oh, yeah?

4354
02:31:54,420 --> 02:31:55,420
Do it.

4355
02:31:55,660 --> 02:31:56,720
Do it now.

4356
02:31:58,200 --> 02:31:59,360
Spawn in now.

4357
02:31:59,500 --> 02:32:00,280
I ain't scared.

4358
02:32:01,600 --> 02:32:02,940
I ain't afraid of no ghost.

4359
02:32:03,060 --> 02:32:04,260
Yeah, I ain't afraid of no ghost.

4360
02:32:04,400 --> 02:32:06,020
There's literally a ghost right beside me.

4361
02:32:07,400 --> 02:32:07,780
I'm gone.

4362
02:32:07,780 --> 02:32:07,920
I'm long gone.

4363
02:32:07,920 --> 02:32:08,660
She's not scary.

4364
02:32:11,540 --> 02:32:12,600
I am scary.

4365
02:32:12,740 --> 02:32:13,260
You're not.

4366
02:32:13,660 --> 02:32:14,760
You're not fucking scary.

4367
02:32:14,860 --> 02:32:16,460
You've never scared anybody in your life.

4368
02:32:16,460 --> 02:32:17,300
Yes, I have.

4369
02:32:17,340 --> 02:32:17,900
No, you have.

4370
02:32:18,120 --> 02:32:18,420
Name one.

4371
02:32:18,560 --> 02:32:18,840
Yes, I have.

4372
02:32:18,940 --> 02:32:19,360
Name one.

4373
02:32:19,480 --> 02:32:19,820
Name one.

4374
02:32:20,240 --> 02:32:21,700
You want to watch me scare him right now?

4375
02:32:22,180 --> 02:32:22,460
Yeah.

4376
02:32:22,980 --> 02:32:23,900
I'm graduating.

4377
02:32:31,300 --> 02:32:32,460
Forever done worse.

4378
02:32:36,600 --> 02:32:37,400
That's it?

4379
02:32:38,120 --> 02:32:39,140
It's a joke, guys.

4380
02:32:39,200 --> 02:32:39,720
It's a joke.

4381
02:32:39,860 --> 02:32:40,900
They're all sad now.

4382
02:32:41,080 --> 02:32:42,420
They're all really spooked right now.

4383
02:32:42,540 --> 02:32:42,940
They're like, wow.

4384
02:32:42,940 --> 02:32:44,320
They're like PTSD.

4385
02:32:49,140 --> 02:32:50,740
Too far.

4386
02:32:50,800 --> 02:32:51,260
It's a joke.

4387
02:32:51,640 --> 02:32:52,040
Too far.

4388
02:32:52,060 --> 02:32:53,200
JK, JK.

4389
02:32:53,480 --> 02:32:55,240
She's a monster.

4390
02:33:00,920 --> 02:33:03,180
I scared you guys.

4391
02:33:04,880 --> 02:33:06,480
Halloween's over.

4392
02:33:11,390 --> 02:33:13,130
Am I getting redstone?

4393
02:33:13,630 --> 02:33:13,970
Okay.

4394
02:33:14,590 --> 02:33:15,070
Yeah.

4395
02:33:16,370 --> 02:33:19,230
When you get redstone, does it give you experience?

4396
02:33:19,410 --> 02:33:19,730
Yeah, it does.

4397
02:33:19,930 --> 02:33:21,210
Yeah, then mine it.

4398
02:33:21,370 --> 02:33:22,250
You don't have to take it.

4399
02:33:22,310 --> 02:33:22,870
Just mine it.

4400
02:33:24,030 --> 02:33:25,030
Why should I?

4401
02:33:25,350 --> 02:33:26,710
I'm already level 11.

4402
02:33:27,230 --> 02:33:29,830
Because we need it to enchant our stuff.

4403
02:33:29,950 --> 02:33:30,830
We need more experience.

4404
02:33:32,330 --> 02:33:32,810
Fine.

4405
02:33:34,030 --> 02:33:34,510
Fine.

4406
02:33:35,790 --> 02:33:36,270
Fine.

4407
02:33:37,170 --> 02:33:39,770
I guess I'll do it.

4408
02:33:40,150 --> 02:33:41,230
I'll do anything with this bamboo.

4409
02:33:42,210 --> 02:33:43,330
You can make sugar.

4410
02:33:44,330 --> 02:33:45,810
Wait, no, that's not...

4411
02:33:45,810 --> 02:33:46,590
That's sugar canes.

4412
02:33:46,670 --> 02:33:47,410
You can make paper.

4413
02:33:49,670 --> 02:33:50,610
I'm making sticks.

4414
02:33:54,500 --> 02:33:55,700
I'm making...

4415
02:33:55,700 --> 02:33:56,700
I'm strip mining.

4416
02:33:56,840 --> 02:33:58,460
I'm stripping.

4417
02:34:00,520 --> 02:34:01,640
I'm stripping.

4418
02:34:01,820 --> 02:34:03,660
That's like the short form for strip mining, right?

4419
02:34:04,280 --> 02:34:04,580
Yeah.

4420
02:34:05,520 --> 02:34:06,720
We're all stripping.

4421
02:34:07,260 --> 02:34:09,380
You're stripping, I'm stripping.

4422
02:34:09,380 --> 02:34:10,680
Will it be enough?

4423
02:34:10,960 --> 02:34:11,320
I wonder.

4424
02:34:13,380 --> 02:34:14,020
That's strip mining.

4425
02:34:14,200 --> 02:34:14,920
Is that what it means?

4426
02:34:15,440 --> 02:34:16,740
We're stripping.

4427
02:34:16,920 --> 02:34:17,740
We're doing it.

4428
02:34:19,120 --> 02:34:20,460
We're stripping so fast.

4429
02:34:23,640 --> 02:34:25,380
Oh my god, I'm gonna go crazy.

4430
02:34:25,560 --> 02:34:26,680
I swear, if we fucking...

4431
02:34:26,680 --> 02:34:29,540
If we die during this run, I swear to god...

4432
02:34:29,540 --> 02:34:31,840
I don't think I can do this again.

4433
02:34:32,760 --> 02:34:34,180
What are you talking about?

4434
02:34:34,380 --> 02:34:36,260
We're so much more experienced now.

4435
02:34:36,260 --> 02:34:39,400
I don't think I can start stripping again, man.

4436
02:34:39,480 --> 02:34:41,260
I hate this.

4437
02:34:42,010 --> 02:34:44,300
Actually, I don't mind the stripping, because...

4438
02:34:44,300 --> 02:34:45,580
You don't mind the stripping?

4439
02:34:45,980 --> 02:34:46,780
It's really...

4440
02:34:46,780 --> 02:34:49,900
It's kind of relaxing to just...

4441
02:34:49,900 --> 02:34:52,900
Yeah, especially when they give you super chats while you're stripping.

4442
02:34:53,900 --> 02:34:54,920
They don't do that.

4443
02:34:56,500 --> 02:34:57,920
So you're stripping for free?

4444
02:35:00,060 --> 02:35:01,260
It's like a hobby.

4445
02:35:02,520 --> 02:35:04,540
It's like a...

4446
02:35:04,540 --> 02:35:05,700
It's just...

4447
02:35:05,700 --> 02:35:07,340
It's just a stress reliever.

4448
02:35:10,300 --> 02:35:11,420
It's like a hobby.

4449
02:35:11,600 --> 02:35:12,440
I'm just like...

4450
02:35:12,440 --> 02:35:14,720
Do it for experience.

4451
02:35:15,700 --> 02:35:17,740
I lose myself in the stripping.

4452
02:35:19,260 --> 02:35:20,700
I don't think about it.

4453
02:35:20,740 --> 02:35:22,320
My mind just goes blank.

4454
02:35:28,600 --> 02:35:30,780
Before I know it...

4455
02:35:30,780 --> 02:35:30,880
Ah!

4456
02:35:31,840 --> 02:35:33,840
Mint, I swear to God.

4457
02:35:33,960 --> 02:35:34,400
Mint, please.

4458
02:35:34,520 --> 02:35:35,580
I swear to God, I can't...

4459
02:35:35,580 --> 02:35:37,040
I can't keep stripping, Mint.

4460
02:35:37,120 --> 02:35:38,400
I'm okay.

4461
02:35:41,040 --> 02:35:43,000
I've hit lava, but I'm okay.

4462
02:35:44,940 --> 02:35:46,780
Thanks, guys, for the dollar bills.

4463
02:35:47,160 --> 02:35:48,860
While I'm stripping.

4464
02:35:50,620 --> 02:35:52,120
Yeah, where's your dollar bills?

4465
02:35:53,480 --> 02:35:54,060
Oh, hey!

4466
02:35:54,200 --> 02:35:55,640
Have you hit diamond, Mint?

4467
02:35:55,980 --> 02:35:57,080
Have you hit diamond?

4468
02:35:57,080 --> 02:35:57,340
Have you hit diamond?

4469
02:35:58,080 --> 02:35:59,660
Have you hit diamond?

4470
02:36:01,100 --> 02:36:03,280
Everyone remembers the first time.

4471
02:36:03,400 --> 02:36:04,720
Nobody remembers the second time.

4472
02:36:05,180 --> 02:36:07,310
Yeah, that's why people always remember...

4473
02:36:07,940 --> 02:36:09,410
our first experience.

4474
02:36:11,640 --> 02:36:13,380
It wasn't my experience.

4475
02:36:13,860 --> 02:36:15,840
This is all original right here.

4476
02:36:18,360 --> 02:36:20,280
This never happened before.

4477
02:36:20,700 --> 02:36:22,340
Actually, you know...

4478
02:36:22,340 --> 02:36:24,760
I never played Minecraft, you know.

4479
02:36:24,760 --> 02:36:27,260
Yeah, you never played Minecraft before.

4480
02:36:27,360 --> 02:36:28,820
Then how come you knew so much...

4481
02:36:29,320 --> 02:36:29,880
about stripping?

4482
02:36:31,740 --> 02:36:33,140
Thanks for the dollar bills, guys.

4483
02:36:33,240 --> 02:36:34,220
I really appreciate it.

4484
02:36:34,260 --> 02:36:34,960
I worked so hard.

4485
02:36:35,260 --> 02:36:37,880
Thank you, guys.

4486
02:36:38,160 --> 02:36:39,960
Thank you for the dollar bills.

4487
02:36:41,380 --> 02:36:42,280
I'm stripping.

4488
02:36:43,260 --> 02:36:45,000
Well, it's not a hobby anymore.

4489
02:36:45,100 --> 02:36:45,980
They're paying you.

4490
02:36:47,020 --> 02:36:48,120
No, it's...

4491
02:36:49,080 --> 02:36:50,620
What is it called then?

4492
02:36:51,640 --> 02:36:52,680
It's called...

4493
02:36:53,360 --> 02:36:53,800
Oh, I don't know.

4494
02:36:55,160 --> 02:36:56,480
Do I need to get a...

4495
02:36:56,480 --> 02:36:58,340
Oh no, do I need to LLC this strip?

4496
02:36:59,020 --> 02:37:00,400
Oh no, now you gotta...

4497
02:37:00,400 --> 02:37:02,500
make sure it's taxed properly.

4498
02:37:03,980 --> 02:37:06,520
Gotta add the GMT taxes, guys.

4499
02:37:06,740 --> 02:37:07,860
That's the Canadian tax.

4500
02:37:08,060 --> 02:37:09,500
YouTube's not gonna like this.

4501
02:37:14,430 --> 02:37:17,230
They're already pressing the button...

4502
02:37:17,230 --> 02:37:19,390
on banning our accounts at this very moment.

4503
02:37:19,510 --> 02:37:20,090
Banning accounts?

4504
02:37:20,170 --> 02:37:20,970
What did we do wrong?

4505
02:37:21,010 --> 02:37:21,710
We're just stripping.

4506
02:37:22,650 --> 02:37:24,150
Yeah, we're stripping.

4507
02:37:24,150 --> 02:37:25,450
We're stripping for ore.

4508
02:37:26,050 --> 02:37:26,570
For money.

4509
02:37:26,730 --> 02:37:28,490
For money, guys.

4510
02:37:28,910 --> 02:37:29,550
It's not legal.

4511
02:37:30,010 --> 02:37:30,950
We're just strip mining.

4512
02:37:35,290 --> 02:37:37,110
It's not legal, guys.

4513
02:37:37,670 --> 02:37:39,210
It's not against your TOS.

4514
02:37:39,890 --> 02:37:41,450
Did you just say it's not legal?

4515
02:37:41,590 --> 02:37:42,530
It's not illegal.

4516
02:37:42,970 --> 02:37:43,810
Oh, not illegal.

4517
02:37:44,250 --> 02:37:45,210
Yeah, yeah.

4518
02:37:47,550 --> 02:37:49,490
We're just strip mining.

4519
02:37:50,170 --> 02:37:51,510
Oh my gosh.

4520
02:37:52,190 --> 02:37:53,570
Did you see like the...

4521
02:37:53,570 --> 02:37:55,030
Twitch TOS about like...

4522
02:37:55,030 --> 02:37:55,850
VTuber hips?

4523
02:37:56,810 --> 02:37:58,450
I thought that was funny.

4524
02:37:59,170 --> 02:38:01,250
Well, I mean, it fucking sucks, but like...

4525
02:38:01,250 --> 02:38:03,490
I thought that was funny because like...

4526
02:38:03,490 --> 02:38:05,550
I played like Nikkei.

4527
02:38:05,610 --> 02:38:07,350
I got sponsored for Nikkei.

4528
02:38:07,510 --> 02:38:09,530
And then I was like, you know, the girls.

4529
02:38:13,230 --> 02:38:15,370
But it's not a bad...

4530
02:38:15,370 --> 02:38:17,390
It's like a game character.

4531
02:38:18,270 --> 02:38:19,150
Yeah, yeah.

4532
02:38:19,270 --> 02:38:20,690
We're not real, though.

4533
02:38:20,950 --> 02:38:21,790
We're not real.

4534
02:38:22,910 --> 02:38:24,390
What if we were in a game?

4535
02:38:24,410 --> 02:38:25,290
I made a game.

4536
02:38:25,510 --> 02:38:26,390
And we were in a game, too.

4537
02:38:26,910 --> 02:38:28,570
Technically, we're video game characters.

4538
02:38:28,910 --> 02:38:29,810
Yeah, we are video game characters.

4539
02:38:30,350 --> 02:38:33,710
I mean, we're not Twitch streamers, but like, technically, like...

4540
02:38:33,710 --> 02:38:35,190
If we were, we'd be fine.

4541
02:38:35,350 --> 02:38:36,030
Yeah, we'd be fine.

4542
02:38:36,070 --> 02:38:37,010
We'll be within TOS.

4543
02:38:38,170 --> 02:38:38,430
Yeah.

4544
02:38:39,030 --> 02:38:39,470
Yeah.

4545
02:38:40,110 --> 02:38:43,770
Someone was just like, my mom asked me what I am watching.

4546
02:38:43,770 --> 02:38:47,870
Because we keep saying we're stripping.

4547
02:38:49,710 --> 02:38:51,830
We're Minecraft friendly VTubers.

4548
02:38:52,890 --> 02:38:53,790
We're playing Minecraft.

4549
02:38:53,830 --> 02:38:54,950
Yeah, we're playing Minecraft.

4550
02:38:55,290 --> 02:38:55,730
Don't worry.

4551
02:38:55,870 --> 02:38:56,850
Just say like...

4552
02:38:56,850 --> 02:39:00,010
Just say it's like the new name for mining.

4553
02:39:00,710 --> 02:39:01,070
You know?

4554
02:39:01,290 --> 02:39:02,590
I don't know what strip mining is.

4555
02:39:03,530 --> 02:39:05,510
That's like not a Minecraft thing.

4556
02:39:05,630 --> 02:39:05,930
Yeah.

4557
02:39:06,290 --> 02:39:06,770
It's not.

4558
02:39:08,690 --> 02:39:12,350
Do you think mining was invented in Minecraft?

4559
02:39:12,350 --> 02:39:14,330
I can't believe it, guys.

4560
02:39:14,490 --> 02:39:16,410
Mining was invented in Minecraft, everybody.

4561
02:39:18,330 --> 02:39:19,570
Oh my god, you're right.

4562
02:39:20,370 --> 02:39:22,490
Oh my god, someone was saying I'm watching miners.

4563
02:39:22,770 --> 02:39:24,250
No, guys, don't say that.

4564
02:39:24,450 --> 02:39:27,330
No, no, no, no, no.

4565
02:39:27,330 --> 02:39:28,210
No, no, no.

4566
02:39:28,850 --> 02:39:30,370
No, no, no, no.

4567
02:39:30,810 --> 02:39:32,710
No, no, no, no.

4568
02:39:32,910 --> 02:39:33,150
Uh -oh.

4569
02:39:33,350 --> 02:39:35,850
The bit is getting too dangerous.

4570
02:39:36,370 --> 02:39:37,470
Okay, all right, guys.

4571
02:39:37,790 --> 02:39:39,550
All right, show's over.

4572
02:39:39,550 --> 02:39:40,770
Show's over.

4573
02:39:40,970 --> 02:39:42,110
We're closing down.

4574
02:39:42,130 --> 02:39:43,830
The bit is getting too dangerous.

4575
02:39:44,250 --> 02:39:47,630
We're changing businesses and hobbies.

4576
02:39:50,350 --> 02:39:51,190
Yeah.

4577
02:39:51,670 --> 02:39:52,690
Oh my god.

4578
02:39:53,230 --> 02:39:54,590
There's so much redstone.

4579
02:39:55,150 --> 02:39:56,650
How much do we need again?

4580
02:39:57,230 --> 02:39:58,110
For redstone?

4581
02:39:58,310 --> 02:39:59,990
No, like diamond.

4582
02:40:00,790 --> 02:40:02,390
Diamond was...

4583
02:40:03,190 --> 02:40:05,290
I hear zombies next to me.

4584
02:40:06,370 --> 02:40:07,210
27?

4585
02:40:07,970 --> 02:40:08,770
I think.

4586
02:40:09,350 --> 02:40:12,970
Well, 24 is for the armor and then it's 3 for...

4587
02:40:12,970 --> 02:40:17,590
Oh my gosh, I hate...

4588
02:40:17,590 --> 02:40:18,570
24 for armor.

4589
02:40:18,690 --> 02:40:19,790
Okay, I already have the boots.

4590
02:40:21,690 --> 02:40:22,670
You made boots?

4591
02:40:22,910 --> 02:40:23,890
Yeah, I already made the boots.

4592
02:40:24,650 --> 02:40:25,790
I'm almost done.

4593
02:40:27,370 --> 02:40:28,710
That's a bit of a stretch.

4594
02:40:29,630 --> 02:40:30,570
Well, I'm almost...

4595
02:40:30,570 --> 02:40:31,910
That's like 1 out of 4.

4596
02:40:34,070 --> 02:40:35,030
That's 25%.

4597
02:40:35,030 --> 02:40:36,070
It's not even 50%.

4598
02:40:36,070 --> 02:40:38,030
Do you have any boots?

4599
02:40:38,170 --> 02:40:38,830
I don't think so.

4600
02:40:39,450 --> 02:40:40,950
I don't think you have diamond boots.

4601
02:40:41,510 --> 02:40:43,090
I haven't made diamond anything.

4602
02:40:43,510 --> 02:40:45,830
I'm saving until I have the full...

4603
02:40:45,830 --> 02:40:46,550
Exactly.

4604
02:40:47,170 --> 02:40:48,510
Full set, baby.

4605
02:40:48,970 --> 02:40:51,710
And then a zombie is gonna get you.

4606
02:40:53,570 --> 02:40:55,450
Why are you wishing death upon me?

4607
02:40:55,650 --> 02:40:57,350
I'm not wishing death upon you.

4608
02:40:57,370 --> 02:41:00,770
I'm trying to tell you that you're not playing it safe.

4609
02:41:01,090 --> 02:41:02,810
I don't even have pants on right now.

4610
02:41:05,030 --> 02:41:05,410
Are you streaming in public?

4611
02:41:07,050 --> 02:41:07,990
I'm in a cave.

4612
02:41:08,210 --> 02:41:09,030
Are you streaming in public?

4613
02:41:11,690 --> 02:41:13,150
I mean, your wisp is here.

4614
02:41:13,370 --> 02:41:14,150
Surrounding you.

4615
02:41:15,230 --> 02:41:18,140
Where are the ghosts?

4616
02:41:18,580 --> 02:41:20,380
I mean, they're ghosts, so you can't see them.

4617
02:41:20,860 --> 02:41:22,500
Do you think ghosts can see other ghosts?

4618
02:41:23,120 --> 02:41:23,980
Yes, we can.

4619
02:41:24,140 --> 02:41:24,880
How do you know that?

4620
02:41:25,620 --> 02:41:26,680
Have you seen another ghost?

4621
02:41:28,480 --> 02:41:28,980
Yes, I have.

4622
02:41:31,000 --> 02:41:32,460
I've seen many ghosts.

4623
02:41:32,940 --> 02:41:33,340
Who?

4624
02:41:34,440 --> 02:41:35,860
I met George Washington.

4625
02:41:36,840 --> 02:41:37,520
Oh, yeah?

4626
02:41:37,780 --> 02:41:38,720
What does he look like?

4627
02:41:39,600 --> 02:41:40,360
He has...

4628
02:41:40,360 --> 02:41:41,240
What's his middle name?

4629
02:41:44,800 --> 02:41:47,300
Oh, so you didn't actually, like, meet him.

4630
02:41:47,540 --> 02:41:48,180
You didn't really...

4631
02:41:48,180 --> 02:41:50,500
Okay, Doki, what's my middle name, huh?

4632
02:41:51,320 --> 02:41:52,520
I don't know, I haven't met you.

4633
02:41:56,000 --> 02:41:56,960
That's next week.

4634
02:41:56,960 --> 02:41:58,640
I'll know your middle name next week.

4635
02:41:59,560 --> 02:42:01,680
This is like a phone call.

4636
02:42:01,920 --> 02:42:03,280
This is a phone call.

4637
02:42:03,280 --> 02:42:05,140
It's not like I actually met you.

4638
02:42:08,960 --> 02:42:10,040
It's like...

4639
02:42:10,040 --> 02:42:11,740
It's like a seance, you know?

4640
02:42:16,040 --> 02:42:19,480
Good amount of diamond and redstone all together.

4641
02:42:20,780 --> 02:42:22,200
Oh my god, I hit level 15.

4642
02:42:22,360 --> 02:42:22,760
Let's go.

4643
02:42:24,460 --> 02:42:25,620
Just level 15?

4644
02:42:26,240 --> 02:42:27,300
What level are you?

4645
02:42:27,480 --> 02:42:27,880
16.

4646
02:42:27,880 --> 02:42:28,720
I'm level 16.

4647
02:42:30,160 --> 02:42:30,760
Wow.

4648
02:42:32,200 --> 02:42:34,680
Remember when you were saying that about my...

4649
02:42:34,680 --> 02:42:37,080
When you had 11 diamonds and I had 10?

4650
02:42:38,500 --> 02:42:39,400
Okay, fine then.

4651
02:42:40,240 --> 02:42:40,840
Yeah.

4652
02:42:41,620 --> 02:42:42,220
I remember.

4653
02:42:42,500 --> 02:42:43,220
Now I'm level 16.

4654
02:42:43,700 --> 02:42:45,160
Wow, now I'm level 17.

4655
02:42:45,540 --> 02:42:46,120
Good for you.

4656
02:42:47,260 --> 02:42:48,300
No, you're not.

4657
02:42:48,620 --> 02:42:50,280
I'm level 16 plus infinity.

4658
02:42:50,500 --> 02:42:51,320
Oh, yeah?

4659
02:42:51,840 --> 02:42:54,580
I'm level...

4660
02:42:54,580 --> 02:42:57,180
I'm level 18 and my dad works at Nintendo.

4661
02:42:58,160 --> 02:42:59,300
This is Minecraft!

4662
02:43:03,260 --> 02:43:05,580
Who cares if your dad works at Nintendo?

4663
02:43:06,140 --> 02:43:07,120
I care!

4664
02:43:07,660 --> 02:43:09,160
Minecraft is on the Switch!

4665
02:43:09,780 --> 02:43:12,300
Your dad doesn't do anything with Minecraft.

4666
02:43:13,380 --> 02:43:14,440
You don't know that.

4667
02:43:14,920 --> 02:43:15,660
You don't know that.

4668
02:43:15,820 --> 02:43:19,980
What if he works in the Minecraft division for the Switch?

4669
02:43:20,280 --> 02:43:22,600
You're saying he works at the mines at Nintendo?

4670
02:43:22,600 --> 02:43:23,200
Yeah.

4671
02:43:23,760 --> 02:43:25,180
It must feel like it.

4672
02:43:30,100 --> 02:43:33,780
We know how JP companies are.

4673
02:43:34,480 --> 02:43:36,680
I think Nintendo is alright though.

4674
02:43:36,980 --> 02:43:38,000
Comparatively speaking.

4675
02:43:38,260 --> 02:43:38,560
Yeah.

4676
02:43:39,980 --> 02:43:41,800
No, was it Nintendo?

4677
02:43:41,980 --> 02:43:44,220
Wasn't there an article of one of the...

4678
02:43:44,220 --> 02:43:45,440
Wait, we need Lapis, right?

4679
02:43:46,040 --> 02:43:48,160
Yeah, and we also need sponsorship, so...

4680
02:43:48,160 --> 02:43:49,160
Okay, yeah, you're right.

4681
02:43:57,880 --> 02:43:58,940
I love Nintendo.

4682
02:44:01,100 --> 02:44:01,580
I love Nintendo.

4683
02:44:03,120 --> 02:44:04,100
Let's go, Nintendo!

4684
02:44:04,300 --> 02:44:06,260
I have like more than a stack of Lapis.

4685
02:44:06,320 --> 02:44:08,140
Do we need more than one stack of Lapis?

4686
02:44:08,700 --> 02:44:10,700
I have almost two stacks.

4687
02:44:11,000 --> 02:44:12,880
Okay, I have almost two stacks as well.

4688
02:44:13,000 --> 02:44:14,860
Yeah, so I think...

4689
02:44:14,860 --> 02:44:16,780
It really depends on our RNG.

4690
02:44:17,340 --> 02:44:18,980
I love Nintendo, guys.

4691
02:44:23,560 --> 02:44:25,440
Flip it and chip it.

4692
02:44:30,520 --> 02:44:32,700
Oh my gosh, I don't want to do this again.

4693
02:44:32,880 --> 02:44:33,980
Doki, we can't die.

4694
02:44:34,220 --> 02:44:35,780
Why are you saying that to me?

4695
02:44:36,340 --> 02:44:37,480
We have to make it.

4696
02:44:37,480 --> 02:44:38,740
Are you trying to imply something?

4697
02:44:39,500 --> 02:44:42,880
We have to make it to the Ender Dragon.

4698
02:44:43,200 --> 02:44:44,440
I don't think I can strip mine again.

4699
02:44:45,120 --> 02:44:45,620
I can't strip mine.

4700
02:44:45,620 --> 02:44:48,180
I can't go back to stripping, Min.

4701
02:44:48,420 --> 02:44:51,820
How did the other streamers that you were inspired by...

4702
02:44:51,820 --> 02:44:52,980
How did they do this?

4703
02:44:53,360 --> 02:44:55,120
It took them...

4704
02:44:55,120 --> 02:44:57,460
It took them 20 days, Min.

4705
02:44:57,520 --> 02:44:59,360
I don't think that they are the...

4706
02:44:59,360 --> 02:45:01,180
I don't think they are like the...

4707
02:45:01,180 --> 02:45:03,440
The goal of like...

4708
02:45:03,440 --> 02:45:05,000
Are we doing it right, chat?

4709
02:45:05,060 --> 02:45:05,880
Are we doing this right?

4710
02:45:06,400 --> 02:45:07,400
I don't think we are.

4711
02:45:07,500 --> 02:45:09,140
I don't think we're meant to even have diamond.

4712
02:45:09,400 --> 02:45:10,520
I think they're like...

4713
02:45:10,520 --> 02:45:12,280
Are we though?

4714
02:45:12,860 --> 02:45:14,480
We could do this with iron.

4715
02:45:16,620 --> 02:45:17,020
Wait!

4716
02:45:17,280 --> 02:45:18,740
What if we built snowmen?

4717
02:45:18,740 --> 02:45:19,540
Like, you remember?

4718
02:45:20,300 --> 02:45:20,780
Oh yeah!

4719
02:45:21,840 --> 02:45:24,620
We need to find the ice biome and just farm snow.

4720
02:45:25,240 --> 02:45:25,620
Okay.

4721
02:45:27,080 --> 02:45:30,000
That won't kill the Endermen, I think.

4722
02:45:30,060 --> 02:45:31,260
It won't kill anything else.

4723
02:45:32,700 --> 02:45:35,020
Yeah, no, it would hit the Ender Dragon as well.

4724
02:45:35,740 --> 02:45:36,240
Does it?

4725
02:45:37,800 --> 02:45:38,340
Yeah.

4726
02:45:40,860 --> 02:45:42,880
Make an army of snowmen?

4727
02:45:43,200 --> 02:45:44,220
Yeah, yeah.

4728
02:45:44,260 --> 02:45:45,280
Pretty sure that works.

4729
02:45:46,660 --> 02:45:48,020
Snowballs don't do damage.

4730
02:45:48,200 --> 02:45:50,820
Wait, what the point was to make snowmen?

4731
02:45:52,580 --> 02:45:53,760
Why did we do that?

4732
02:45:54,120 --> 02:45:55,160
Why did we do that?

4733
02:45:55,300 --> 02:45:56,320
Yeah, why did we do that?

4734
02:45:57,400 --> 02:45:58,520
Why did we do that then?

4735
02:45:58,760 --> 02:46:01,920
I think you're the one that suggested it too in the past.

4736
02:46:01,920 --> 02:46:02,580
No, it's not!

4737
02:46:02,740 --> 02:46:03,740
Don't put this on me!

4738
02:46:04,280 --> 02:46:05,220
Why did we do that?

4739
02:46:05,900 --> 02:46:07,320
Oh, it was to stagger?

4740
02:46:08,240 --> 02:46:09,280
They can only hurt...

4741
02:46:10,240 --> 02:46:10,600
Blazes.

4742
02:46:10,820 --> 02:46:12,160
But we didn't even do that for the Blazes.

4743
02:46:12,160 --> 02:46:14,740
Oh my god, we gotta find the fucking fortress.

4744
02:46:15,580 --> 02:46:18,580
No, we don't need a...

4745
02:46:18,580 --> 02:46:20,540
We need blaze rods.

4746
02:46:23,600 --> 02:46:26,020
It's fine, we did a fire resistance potions.

4747
02:46:26,100 --> 02:46:26,600
We'll be fine.

4748
02:46:26,900 --> 02:46:27,660
Will we though?

4749
02:46:29,080 --> 02:46:29,560
Probably.

4750
02:46:29,840 --> 02:46:30,840
Will we be fine?

4751
02:46:32,100 --> 02:46:32,580
Probably.

4752
02:46:37,100 --> 02:46:38,040
Where's your name?

4753
02:46:38,100 --> 02:46:39,260
I don't even see your name anymore.

4754
02:46:39,260 --> 02:46:39,900
I don't even know anymore.

4755
02:46:40,120 --> 02:46:42,640
I've been stripping for...

4756
02:46:42,640 --> 02:46:44,080
I've been stripping my...

4757
02:46:44,080 --> 02:46:47,180
I don't wanna go back to stripping.

4758
02:46:47,320 --> 02:46:48,460
Guys, I can't.

4759
02:46:48,460 --> 02:46:49,860
I can't do it again.

4760
02:46:52,780 --> 02:46:55,300
I need to turn down the music a little.

4761
02:46:55,500 --> 02:46:56,700
I'm going a little crazy.

4762
02:46:57,640 --> 02:46:58,340
What's your music?

4763
02:46:58,720 --> 02:47:01,680
It's just like a free BGM channel.

4764
02:47:01,880 --> 02:47:04,280
Called BGM present or some shit.

4765
02:47:04,820 --> 02:47:06,940
I think I ran into your...

4766
02:47:06,940 --> 02:47:08,480
It's in my...

4767
02:47:16,940 --> 02:47:19,220
It makes the fight easier.

4768
02:47:19,580 --> 02:47:20,960
Also, we weren't crazy.

4769
02:47:21,280 --> 02:47:22,720
We weren't crazy then.

4770
02:47:23,300 --> 02:47:23,560
Crazy?

4771
02:47:23,780 --> 02:47:24,640
I was crazy once.

4772
02:47:24,780 --> 02:47:25,820
They locked me in a strip mine.

4773
02:47:26,000 --> 02:47:31,040
A mine full of strippers.

4774
02:47:33,360 --> 02:47:34,480
I wish.

4775
02:47:35,560 --> 02:47:36,440
Oh my gosh.

4776
02:47:36,500 --> 02:47:38,200
What if we find the...

4777
02:47:38,200 --> 02:47:38,800
What's that thing?

4778
02:47:39,340 --> 02:47:40,120
That new thing.

4779
02:47:40,500 --> 02:47:42,520
The what?

4780
02:47:42,720 --> 02:47:43,300
The crippling?

4781
02:47:44,000 --> 02:47:44,500
The what?

4782
02:47:45,620 --> 02:47:46,300
The crinkler?

4783
02:47:46,560 --> 02:47:47,660
Whatever the fuck that was.

4784
02:47:49,720 --> 02:47:54,160
What's that thing?

4785
02:47:54,920 --> 02:47:55,960
The trials.

4786
02:47:56,140 --> 02:47:57,640
The trials?

4787
02:47:57,940 --> 02:47:59,060
The fuck is that?

4788
02:47:59,180 --> 02:48:01,500
How many things did they add since I last played?

4789
02:48:01,500 --> 02:48:03,040
It's crazy.

4790
02:48:03,300 --> 02:48:04,600
Minecraft is crazy now.

4791
02:48:05,900 --> 02:48:07,120
The scruggly?

4792
02:48:07,360 --> 02:48:09,060
The scruggly?

4793
02:48:10,440 --> 02:48:11,620
Oh, I hear a skelly.

4794
02:48:12,380 --> 02:48:13,440
Where am I?

4795
02:48:14,080 --> 02:48:14,940
No skelly, please.

4796
02:48:15,540 --> 02:48:16,660
What if I like...

4797
02:48:16,660 --> 02:48:20,520
What if like...

4798
02:48:20,520 --> 02:48:24,260
I grabbed that moment again and then redubbed it to like...

4799
02:48:24,260 --> 02:48:26,900
Change redubbed it to names.

4800
02:48:28,320 --> 02:48:28,740
What?

4801
02:48:28,740 --> 02:48:30,740
You know the first moment?

4802
02:48:31,680 --> 02:48:32,340
Oh, yeah.

4803
02:48:32,460 --> 02:48:35,360
And I redubbed a name so the moment can live on.

4804
02:48:36,300 --> 02:48:37,420
What if we...

4805
02:48:37,420 --> 02:48:42,260
We dub over the names and then we also refilm it.

4806
02:48:44,240 --> 02:48:46,860
Because our skins would be different.

4807
02:48:46,900 --> 02:48:48,880
No, we reanimate it.

4808
02:48:51,480 --> 02:48:55,780
We can make the whole environment look the exact same.

4809
02:48:55,800 --> 02:48:56,740
Oh my god, you're right.

4810
02:48:56,740 --> 02:48:59,140
We can just do it in creative mode.

4811
02:48:59,660 --> 02:49:01,640
Just react it.

4812
02:49:06,560 --> 02:49:11,060
We can do it.

4813
02:49:12,600 --> 02:49:13,880
What is it called?

4814
02:49:14,300 --> 02:49:16,680
The react videos?

4815
02:49:16,940 --> 02:49:17,740
When they...

4816
02:49:17,740 --> 02:49:19,280
It's fair use, guys.

4817
02:49:19,500 --> 02:49:20,160
Fair use.

4818
02:49:20,800 --> 02:49:22,580
We can just...

4819
02:49:22,580 --> 02:49:23,660
We're just like...

4820
02:49:23,660 --> 02:49:25,920
It's like a very famous moment that happened in Minecraft.

4821
02:49:25,920 --> 02:49:26,400
Yeah, yeah.

4822
02:49:27,400 --> 02:49:28,380
It's like a parody.

4823
02:49:29,180 --> 02:49:32,160
We're making a parody.

4824
02:49:37,860 --> 02:49:39,760
We're not claiming we own it.

4825
02:49:39,840 --> 02:49:42,160
We're just trying to parody it because it was such a...

4826
02:49:42,160 --> 02:49:45,380
It was such a famous moment in the internet.

4827
02:49:45,700 --> 02:49:46,840
It's so viral.

4828
02:49:47,620 --> 02:49:48,740
It's transformative.

4829
02:49:48,740 --> 02:49:49,880
It's transformative, exactly.

4830
02:49:50,220 --> 02:49:51,780
Like even...

4831
02:49:52,580 --> 02:49:53,380
What's it?

4832
02:49:53,420 --> 02:49:54,960
Squackity knows about that moment.

4833
02:49:55,720 --> 02:49:58,380
Everyone who plays Minecraft knows that moment.

4834
02:49:58,580 --> 02:49:59,820
What was it called?

4835
02:50:00,680 --> 02:50:03,300
Even ThomasInnit knows about it.

4836
02:50:03,760 --> 02:50:04,480
ThomasInnit.

4837
02:50:04,540 --> 02:50:06,200
Yeah, it was TommyInnit.

4838
02:50:09,860 --> 02:50:10,580
TommyInnit.

4839
02:50:11,040 --> 02:50:13,020
It's YouTube history.

4840
02:50:13,380 --> 02:50:14,380
It's literally...

4841
02:50:14,380 --> 02:50:15,780
It's a tribute we'd be making.

4842
02:50:15,780 --> 02:50:16,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4843
02:50:16,580 --> 02:50:18,180
We're making a tribute.

4844
02:50:19,460 --> 02:50:19,900
Exactly.

4845
02:50:21,820 --> 02:50:23,520
Oh my god, I'm going crazy.

4846
02:50:23,580 --> 02:50:24,040
I have 23.

4847
02:50:24,320 --> 02:50:25,060
I'm almost there.

4848
02:50:25,500 --> 02:50:26,820
Wait, actually, I have it.

4849
02:50:27,440 --> 02:50:28,840
I should be able to make a full army.

4850
02:50:28,960 --> 02:50:29,840
Wait, how many do you have?

4851
02:50:30,140 --> 02:50:31,220
I only have 15.

4852
02:50:33,020 --> 02:50:36,090
What the heck?

4853
02:50:37,450 --> 02:50:38,330
Nothing's changed.

4854
02:50:40,590 --> 02:50:42,650
Clearly, nothing has changed.

4855
02:50:42,650 --> 02:50:45,130
I'm at least finding more.

4856
02:50:45,330 --> 02:50:47,190
I didn't even acknowledge it.

4857
02:50:47,290 --> 02:50:48,830
Because I was like, surely...

4858
02:50:48,830 --> 02:50:51,430
Surely, she's finding stuff, right?

4859
02:50:52,030 --> 02:50:54,010
I'm not finding anything.

4860
02:50:56,110 --> 02:50:57,850
That's unfortunate for you.

4861
02:50:58,250 --> 02:51:00,910
I was finding it at first this whole time.

4862
02:51:01,170 --> 02:51:04,050
Okay, to be fair, you mine faster because you have a diamond pickaxe.

4863
02:51:04,090 --> 02:51:06,070
Are you trying to say that was a good investment?

4864
02:51:07,750 --> 02:51:09,010
Is that what you're trying to say?

4865
02:51:09,190 --> 02:51:10,650
I'm saying you invested...

4866
02:51:10,650 --> 02:51:17,450
Wait, what I did there, where I got a diamond pickaxe, and you're like, no, don't do it.

4867
02:51:17,470 --> 02:51:19,130
Good is subjective, okay?

4868
02:51:19,630 --> 02:51:20,730
Good is subjective.

4869
02:51:21,430 --> 02:51:24,450
I'm just slow because I have just only iron.

4870
02:51:24,710 --> 02:51:25,290
Are you calling me...

4871
02:51:25,290 --> 02:51:27,430
Okay, now you're making fun of me for being poor?

4872
02:51:27,690 --> 02:51:28,730
That's so messed up.

4873
02:51:31,690 --> 02:51:32,950
That's so messed up.

4874
02:51:34,370 --> 02:51:36,970
That's how the world works, baby.

4875
02:51:37,310 --> 02:51:40,650
I'm just trying to make my way through this damn poor world.

4876
02:51:40,950 --> 02:51:42,030
The rich gets richer!

4877
02:51:42,510 --> 02:51:43,650
The rich gets richer!

4878
02:51:44,270 --> 02:51:46,070
That's why you gotta learn now.

4879
02:51:53,410 --> 02:51:56,230
I can't believe you still don't have...

4880
02:51:56,230 --> 02:51:57,690
I can't believe you have 15.

4881
02:51:57,910 --> 02:51:59,190
Okay, well, you know what?

4882
02:51:59,310 --> 02:52:02,190
You're just gonna have to keep digging because you're gonna wait for me.

4883
02:52:02,510 --> 02:52:02,970
That's fine.

4884
02:52:02,970 --> 02:52:04,470
And then I'll get more...

4885
02:52:05,770 --> 02:52:06,190
Damn.

4886
02:52:10,630 --> 02:52:12,050
You can't break the cycle.

4887
02:52:13,570 --> 02:52:19,130
I swear to god, if you die after everything, I'm mine all the way till...

4888
02:52:19,130 --> 02:52:20,830
Till I have my full armor.

4889
02:52:21,150 --> 02:52:21,610
I swear to god.

4890
02:52:24,710 --> 02:52:25,550
Do it!

4891
02:52:26,210 --> 02:52:27,110
We'll do this again.

4892
02:52:27,350 --> 02:52:27,850
No, I'm fine.

4893
02:52:27,850 --> 02:52:28,310
I'm looking.

4894
02:52:28,470 --> 02:52:29,090
I'm doing it again.

4895
02:52:30,290 --> 02:52:31,570
I'm gonna use the bathroom.

4896
02:52:32,330 --> 02:52:34,370
Go kill yourself right now in Minecraft.

4897
02:52:34,510 --> 02:52:35,230
I'm gonna use the bathroom.

4898
02:52:47,650 --> 02:52:49,770
I'm gonna use the bathroom.

4899
02:52:50,230 --> 02:52:53,130
If I come back and you're still alive, I don't know.

4900
02:52:54,130 --> 02:52:54,510
Okay.

4901
02:52:54,510 --> 02:52:54,730
Okay.

4902
02:52:56,510 --> 02:52:57,370
Is she gone?

4903
02:52:59,110 --> 02:52:59,970
Is she gone?

4904
02:53:02,920 --> 02:53:03,660
What was that?

4905
02:53:07,480 --> 02:53:08,740
Guys, did you hear that running?

4906
02:53:11,820 --> 02:53:13,020
Guys, did you hear that running?

4907
02:53:18,060 --> 02:53:19,200
It was like a...

4908
02:53:19,200 --> 02:53:20,640
Wait, what was that?

4909
02:53:34,070 --> 02:53:35,270
Was it me mining that first?

4910
02:53:35,470 --> 02:53:36,170
Actually, I don't know.

4911
02:53:36,550 --> 02:53:37,570
Guys, I almost have enough.

4912
02:53:38,970 --> 02:53:40,130
I almost have enough diamonds.

4913
02:53:42,210 --> 02:53:43,090
The crinkler.

4914
02:53:45,490 --> 02:53:46,370
That wasn't...

4915
02:53:46,370 --> 02:53:47,130
That sounded different.

4916
02:53:47,230 --> 02:53:48,390
No, there's a skeleton right there.

4917
02:53:48,450 --> 02:53:49,670
I think he's on the other side.

4918
02:53:50,870 --> 02:53:52,030
Are you actually gonna die?

4919
02:53:53,130 --> 02:53:54,210
I heard running.

4920
02:53:55,010 --> 02:53:55,450
Running?

4921
02:53:57,430 --> 02:53:59,050
Wait, that's not in the game.

4922
02:53:59,570 --> 02:54:00,170
I don't know.

4923
02:54:00,290 --> 02:54:02,270
I think Herobrine's coming for me.

4924
02:54:02,470 --> 02:54:03,150
Oh, thank god.

4925
02:54:08,010 --> 02:54:09,970
I think Herobrine's here for me.

4926
02:54:09,970 --> 02:54:10,870
It's all...

4927
02:54:10,870 --> 02:54:13,710
You just had like a Halloween mod on.

4928
02:54:13,970 --> 02:54:15,130
This entire time.

4929
02:54:17,570 --> 02:54:17,990
Yeah.

4930
02:54:20,630 --> 02:54:21,930
Oh, skellies.

4931
02:54:22,110 --> 02:54:23,810
Okay, I think I'm about to hit...

4932
02:54:23,810 --> 02:54:26,390
Have you got any new diamonds since...

4933
02:54:26,390 --> 02:54:27,070
Since then?

4934
02:54:27,750 --> 02:54:28,430
Since 15?

4935
02:54:28,530 --> 02:54:29,450
Are you still at 15?

4936
02:54:30,890 --> 02:54:31,830
I'm... Yes.

4937
02:54:31,850 --> 02:54:32,670
Are you still at 15?

4938
02:54:32,870 --> 02:54:33,410
What happened?

4939
02:54:34,070 --> 02:54:34,530
What happened?

4940
02:54:34,710 --> 02:54:38,090
I'm strapping and also there's someone running after me.

4941
02:54:39,970 --> 02:54:41,210
Oh my god, what's that sound?

4942
02:54:42,770 --> 02:54:43,370
Eerie cave.

4943
02:54:48,170 --> 02:54:48,770
Eerie cave.

4944
02:54:50,250 --> 02:54:52,650
Where the fuck did I put my crafting table?

4945
02:54:52,690 --> 02:54:53,190
Oh, right here.

4946
02:54:53,250 --> 02:54:54,010
I didn't pick it up.

4947
02:54:56,830 --> 02:54:57,130
Scary.

4948
02:54:58,450 --> 02:54:58,910
Scary cave.

4949
02:55:00,290 --> 02:55:01,110
What do I wanna make?

4950
02:55:01,150 --> 02:55:02,450
Oh yeah, I wanna make an iron pickaxe.

4951
02:55:02,890 --> 02:55:04,110
My other pickaxe is almost dead.

4952
02:55:04,110 --> 02:55:05,290
How do we get to the crinkler?

4953
02:55:05,410 --> 02:55:06,290
What biome is he in?

4954
02:55:06,310 --> 02:55:08,430
Yeah, what is the crinkler?

4955
02:55:10,830 --> 02:55:11,910
I don't even know.

4956
02:55:12,210 --> 02:55:12,690
Yeah, I don't know.

4957
02:55:12,770 --> 02:55:15,250
The only thing I know about the crinkler is what you just told me.

4958
02:55:15,710 --> 02:55:16,230
He crinkles.

4959
02:55:16,910 --> 02:55:17,690
He crinkles.

4960
02:55:18,230 --> 02:55:19,650
He just crinkles.

4961
02:55:22,590 --> 02:55:23,490
He's behind me.

4962
02:55:23,490 --> 02:55:24,610
Wait, do I have one rail?

4963
02:55:24,750 --> 02:55:25,310
Oh, I do.

4964
02:55:25,570 --> 02:55:28,330
I have one singular rail track.

4965
02:55:29,170 --> 02:55:29,690
Wow.

4966
02:55:35,120 --> 02:55:36,260
I'm gonna go crazy.

4967
02:55:36,420 --> 02:55:38,980
I'm so mining because somebody still doesn't have 24.

4968
02:55:39,780 --> 02:55:40,360
I'm trying!

4969
02:55:40,360 --> 02:55:40,480
I'm mining!

4970
02:55:41,620 --> 02:55:42,820
Are you though?

4971
02:55:43,120 --> 02:55:44,360
Are you really trying?

4972
02:55:44,740 --> 02:55:44,740
I am!

4973
02:55:44,740 --> 02:55:45,840
I'm mining!

4974
02:55:46,540 --> 02:55:48,060
Oh, I'm gonna find your...

4975
02:55:48,060 --> 02:55:49,880
Okay, I'm gonna find where your hole is.

4976
02:55:50,120 --> 02:55:50,980
Then what?

4977
02:55:51,080 --> 02:55:52,280
You're gonna steal my diamonds?

4978
02:55:52,320 --> 02:55:54,000
No, I'm gonna help you!

4979
02:55:54,480 --> 02:55:57,520
You'll steal my diamonds from me and then you'll be like...

4980
02:55:57,520 --> 02:55:59,760
Oh, I have all the diamonds.

4981
02:56:02,700 --> 02:56:04,220
That's what you'll say.

4982
02:56:06,120 --> 02:56:08,780
I don't wanna be stuck in these mines anymore.

4983
02:56:08,780 --> 02:56:10,240
You're not welcome into my hole.

4984
02:56:10,340 --> 02:56:13,260
You're not consenting.

4985
02:56:15,740 --> 02:56:16,720
Stay out!

4986
02:56:17,860 --> 02:56:19,700
I better not see you.

4987
02:56:21,020 --> 02:56:21,980
I don't know where you are.

4988
02:56:22,100 --> 02:56:23,000
I don't know either.

4989
02:56:23,120 --> 02:56:26,460
I've been in this one area.

4990
02:56:28,940 --> 02:56:32,360
If you just keep going forever, you'll eventually get there.

4991
02:56:32,600 --> 02:56:37,180
My great-great-grandchildren are gonna be in this one mine.

4992
02:56:38,780 --> 02:56:41,600
Okay, but we gotta get more levels too, so...

4993
02:56:41,600 --> 02:56:42,520
I'm at level 18!

4994
02:56:42,720 --> 02:56:43,980
How many more levels do we need?

4995
02:56:44,480 --> 02:56:47,060
Do you know how much it costs to level up stuff?

4996
02:56:47,340 --> 02:56:49,080
I don't remember how much!

4997
02:56:49,720 --> 02:56:50,740
No, I don't!

4998
02:56:51,200 --> 02:56:52,060
Do you remember?

4999
02:56:52,780 --> 02:56:54,340
It costs a lot.

5000
02:56:54,680 --> 02:56:55,920
How much is a lot?

5001
02:56:56,820 --> 02:56:57,740
Like 50.

5002
02:56:59,260 --> 02:57:01,140
There's no way it's 50.

5003
02:57:01,840 --> 02:57:02,920
It's a lot, I promise.

5004
02:57:03,020 --> 02:57:03,740
There's no way.

5005
02:57:03,800 --> 02:57:04,720
It's not 50.

5006
02:57:09,080 --> 02:57:09,540
Fucking...

5007
02:57:09,540 --> 02:57:12,600
Having backseaters in my chat, telling me how to dig.

5008
02:57:12,920 --> 02:57:13,960
Oh my god, good.

5009
02:57:17,060 --> 02:57:18,260
I don't know, mid!

5010
02:57:18,280 --> 02:57:19,240
You're at 15!

5011
02:57:19,560 --> 02:57:21,060
I don't have these backseaters!

5012
02:57:21,180 --> 02:57:22,180
That's all I'm saying!

5013
02:57:22,640 --> 02:57:28,820
I got to 24, and I don't have these backseaters right now!

5014
02:57:28,840 --> 02:57:29,060
We don't!

5015
02:57:29,280 --> 02:57:30,640
We need more than 24!

5016
02:57:30,860 --> 02:57:31,180
Doki!

5017
02:57:32,040 --> 02:57:33,880
Oh my god, I want...

5018
02:57:33,880 --> 02:57:34,920
I want...

5019
02:57:40,420 --> 02:57:41,160
I want...

5020
02:57:41,160 --> 02:57:41,960
I have 3 extra.

5021
02:57:42,260 --> 02:57:43,900
What more do we need?

5022
02:57:45,540 --> 02:57:47,040
Wait, what do you mean you have 3 extra?

5023
02:57:47,160 --> 02:57:47,960
I have 3 more.

5024
02:57:48,080 --> 02:57:48,680
I have 3.

5025
02:57:49,640 --> 02:57:50,780
I made all my...

5026
02:57:50,780 --> 02:57:52,020
I had more than 24.

5027
02:57:52,540 --> 02:57:53,100
Oh, wait.

5028
02:57:53,140 --> 02:57:54,160
How much is a sword then?

5029
02:57:54,800 --> 02:57:56,360
Wait, I can make a sword right now.

5030
02:57:56,540 --> 02:57:58,260
I can literally make a sword right now.

5031
02:57:58,360 --> 02:57:59,980
You didn't say that!

5032
02:58:03,580 --> 02:58:04,280
I'm digging.

5033
02:58:05,080 --> 02:58:06,280
I'm digging too.

5034
02:58:06,280 --> 02:58:08,380
I might as well make another diamond pickaxe.

5035
02:58:09,120 --> 02:58:14,280
Might as well use the last 3 to make a diamond pickaxe.

5036
02:58:16,020 --> 02:58:16,580
Oh, fuck it.

5037
02:58:16,600 --> 02:58:17,200
I'm going to do it.

5038
02:58:17,780 --> 02:58:20,260
I don't know how long I'm going to be trapped in this mine.

5039
02:58:22,300 --> 02:58:23,920
I don't know how long I'm going to be trapped in here.

5040
02:58:24,000 --> 02:58:26,780
Might as well make another diamond pickaxe.

5041
02:58:26,900 --> 02:58:27,700
I'm going to go mad.

5042
02:58:27,800 --> 02:58:30,040
I'm going to get mad strip disease.

5043
02:58:32,000 --> 02:58:32,740
Are you done?

5044
02:58:33,860 --> 02:58:34,380
Yeah.

5045
02:58:39,240 --> 02:58:39,760
Yeah.

5046
02:58:41,080 --> 02:58:42,040
I'm done.

5047
02:58:44,840 --> 02:58:48,540
Guys, I know it's been like 3 hours, but whole Mint was not too quiet.

5048
02:58:49,300 --> 02:58:53,000
Because sometimes she hits the green instead of the yellow, so I got a little worried.

5049
02:58:54,940 --> 02:58:55,980
Oh, now...

5050
02:58:58,580 --> 02:58:59,340
Now what?

5051
02:58:59,600 --> 02:59:01,840
Now you finally made armor?

5052
02:59:01,840 --> 02:59:02,200
Yeah.

5053
02:59:08,810 --> 02:59:09,670
Gotta miss them.

5054
02:59:09,790 --> 02:59:11,310
Oh my gosh, I keep clicking the wrong thing.

5055
02:59:12,190 --> 02:59:12,790
I'm like auto...

5056
02:59:14,050 --> 02:59:15,110
Thank god I didn't.

5057
02:59:15,790 --> 02:59:16,670
Don't die!

5058
02:59:18,270 --> 02:59:18,930
Don't die!

5059
02:59:25,590 --> 02:59:27,630
Someone said you could be a little louder.

5060
02:59:27,950 --> 02:59:29,270
Oh my god, no, don't say that.

5061
02:59:29,450 --> 02:59:30,890
It's been 3 hours.

5062
02:59:33,170 --> 02:59:36,070
She could have been a little louder 3 hours ago.

5063
02:59:38,650 --> 02:59:39,430
I don't know.

5064
02:59:39,550 --> 02:59:40,550
I don't know what's wrong with my discord.

5065
02:59:40,730 --> 02:59:41,490
I really don't.

5066
02:59:41,590 --> 02:59:44,070
Yeah, like I have you like...

5067
02:59:44,710 --> 02:59:45,850
Oh my god.

5068
02:59:48,170 --> 02:59:50,210
You apparently could have been a little louder.

5069
02:59:52,550 --> 02:59:53,830
That's not my fault.

5070
02:59:53,950 --> 02:59:54,550
Yes it is.

5071
02:59:54,770 --> 02:59:56,190
There's something wrong with your discord.

5072
02:59:56,350 --> 02:59:57,270
You changed the setting.

5073
02:59:57,470 --> 02:59:59,490
I didn't change anything though.

5074
02:59:59,650 --> 03:00:01,970
I have to get the diamond pickaxe.

5075
03:00:08,490 --> 03:00:08,970
What?

5076
03:00:08,970 --> 03:00:10,130
I'm going fast now.

5077
03:00:11,670 --> 03:00:13,870
Okay, I upped her a bit more, guys.

5078
03:00:16,750 --> 03:00:18,670
So I hope it's a lot better now.

5079
03:00:24,940 --> 03:00:26,800
No, you're like barely in the yellow.

5080
03:00:27,080 --> 03:00:27,960
Am I like quiet on my stream?

5081
03:00:28,040 --> 03:00:28,760
No, you're not.

5082
03:00:28,860 --> 03:00:31,240
You're not quiet on your stream, it's just...

5083
03:00:31,240 --> 03:00:33,660
You did something to your discord...

5084
03:00:33,660 --> 03:00:34,960
That like...

5085
03:00:34,960 --> 03:00:36,660
Made it so that it's...

5086
03:00:36,660 --> 03:00:37,760
Like, I don't know what...

5087
03:00:37,760 --> 03:00:39,500
Something with your setup...

5088
03:00:39,500 --> 03:00:41,860
But all my settings are... I've sent you my settings.

5089
03:00:42,000 --> 03:00:42,680
They're all normal.

5090
03:00:43,120 --> 03:00:44,780
Yeah, but like...

5091
03:00:44,780 --> 03:00:48,540
There was a time where suddenly it was just different.

5092
03:00:48,780 --> 03:00:51,540
Where you're like super quiet for everybody on discord.

5093
03:00:51,820 --> 03:00:52,780
And I don't know what you did.

5094
03:00:52,860 --> 03:00:53,560
I don't know what?

5095
03:00:53,620 --> 03:00:54,660
I didn't do anything!

5096
03:00:55,600 --> 03:00:57,600
Discord's trying to sabotage me!

5097
03:00:58,220 --> 03:00:59,540
I don't know what you did.

5098
03:01:00,120 --> 03:01:01,000
I didn't do anything.

5099
03:01:01,020 --> 03:01:02,280
I don't know what you did.

5100
03:01:02,280 --> 03:01:03,500
That's what they all say.

5101
03:01:03,740 --> 03:01:05,460
That's what they all say.

5102
03:01:05,560 --> 03:01:08,180
That's what they all say.

5103
03:01:10,160 --> 03:01:10,680
Alright.

5104
03:01:12,580 --> 03:01:15,060
My diamond pickaxe is about to break.

5105
03:01:15,160 --> 03:01:17,280
This is how long we've been trip mining for.

5106
03:01:17,920 --> 03:01:18,120
Mint.

5107
03:01:18,660 --> 03:01:20,260
My diamond pick...

5108
03:01:20,260 --> 03:01:21,680
Yeah, I guess finally.

5109
03:01:21,840 --> 03:01:24,260
We've been mining for like an hour plus, I'm pretty sure.

5110
03:01:24,620 --> 03:01:26,620
I'm pretty sure I've been stuck in the...

5111
03:01:26,620 --> 03:01:29,280
I haven't seen daylight in like 20 years, Mint.

5112
03:01:29,660 --> 03:01:32,140
Wait, how do we get out of this?

5113
03:01:32,140 --> 03:01:34,260
We just make a fucking...

5114
03:01:34,260 --> 03:01:35,940
ladder staircase.

5115
03:01:37,480 --> 03:01:38,800
How did your bird take up?

5116
03:01:38,820 --> 03:01:40,240
We've always done that before.

5117
03:01:41,140 --> 03:01:41,400
Okay.

5118
03:01:44,590 --> 03:01:45,830
I wish we had fortune.

5119
03:01:46,370 --> 03:01:47,170
Me too.

5120
03:01:48,070 --> 03:01:49,810
I wish a lot of things, Mint.

5121
03:01:49,990 --> 03:01:52,910
I wish...

5122
03:01:52,910 --> 03:01:54,710
I wish you'd get more diamonds.

5123
03:01:55,270 --> 03:01:57,110
Like at this point, now it's just sad.

5124
03:02:04,170 --> 03:02:05,910
This is just sad now.

5125
03:02:07,070 --> 03:02:08,690
Hey, I'm doing my best, okay?

5126
03:02:08,970 --> 03:02:09,430
Are you?

5127
03:02:10,630 --> 03:02:12,830
You could've made a diamond...

5128
03:02:12,830 --> 03:02:15,610
If you were doing your best, you could've made a diamond pickaxe.

5129
03:02:16,830 --> 03:02:17,970
I made one!

5130
03:02:18,730 --> 03:02:21,650
Now, after an hour and a half...

5131
03:02:24,940 --> 03:02:26,620
It doesn't matter how long it took me.

5132
03:02:26,620 --> 03:02:27,280
Yes, it does!

5133
03:02:27,600 --> 03:02:28,300
Yes, it does!

5134
03:02:33,580 --> 03:02:34,980
It could've been over!

5135
03:02:39,480 --> 03:02:42,000
We would've been out of the mining stages!

5136
03:02:44,380 --> 03:02:45,860
Don't you want this to go?

5137
03:02:46,020 --> 03:02:47,600
How long do you want this stream to go?

5138
03:02:50,600 --> 03:02:52,460
I will cancel my other streams...

5139
03:02:52,460 --> 03:02:53,200
if you're gonna do this.

5140
03:02:59,120 --> 03:02:59,560
Wow.

5141
03:02:59,700 --> 03:03:01,080
That pickaxe is about to die?

5142
03:03:01,400 --> 03:03:04,400
Well, good thing I have enough for another pickaxe!

5143
03:03:04,440 --> 03:03:05,060
Oh my god, that was...

5144
03:03:05,780 --> 03:03:07,220
Oh my god, that was lava.

5145
03:03:10,440 --> 03:03:10,880
Okay.

5146
03:03:15,180 --> 03:03:17,380
YouTube streams can only go up to 12 hours.

5147
03:03:17,560 --> 03:03:19,180
That's why we'll make a part 2!

5148
03:03:20,320 --> 03:03:20,760
Yippee!

5149
03:03:23,000 --> 03:03:23,440
Yahoo!

5150
03:03:24,300 --> 03:03:24,720
Yahoo!

5151
03:03:24,720 --> 03:03:25,340
Yahoo!

5152
03:03:26,900 --> 03:03:28,500
Do you have a lot of iron?

5153
03:03:29,000 --> 03:03:30,140
I have...

5154
03:03:30,880 --> 03:03:31,540
20.

5155
03:03:32,520 --> 03:03:34,620
Okay, we might need more for...

5156
03:03:36,120 --> 03:03:36,780
Shields.

5157
03:03:36,860 --> 03:03:37,220
Okay.

5158
03:03:38,480 --> 03:03:39,280
That's 5.

5159
03:03:40,940 --> 03:03:41,380
Yeah.

5160
03:03:42,660 --> 03:03:45,160
Part 2 is still in the mines!

5161
03:03:46,040 --> 03:03:48,300
At one point, it doesn't turn into a joke.

5162
03:03:48,720 --> 03:03:52,480
It's not my fault that my luck is very bad!

5163
03:03:53,480 --> 03:03:54,700
It's not my fault that my luck is very bad!

5164
03:03:54,700 --> 03:03:56,750
If it was luck, you could have made a diamond pickaxe!

5165
03:03:59,360 --> 03:04:02,280
At that point, it's not luck, it's a skill issue.

5166
03:04:11,180 --> 03:04:14,700
Okay, time to make my fucking...

5167
03:04:15,320 --> 03:04:17,120
another diamond pickaxe!

5168
03:04:17,220 --> 03:04:18,080
Let's fucking go!

5169
03:04:22,140 --> 03:04:24,920
I don't even have fucking...

5170
03:04:24,920 --> 03:04:26,460
I need to make another stick.

5171
03:04:31,850 --> 03:04:33,450
Alright, here we go.

5172
03:04:34,110 --> 03:04:35,870
I'm going down a different direction now.

5173
03:04:36,270 --> 03:04:36,530
Alright.

5174
03:04:36,850 --> 03:04:38,150
I feel promising this way.

5175
03:04:38,270 --> 03:04:38,810
Good for you.

5176
03:04:38,870 --> 03:04:40,590
We don't need redstones, right?

5177
03:04:41,050 --> 03:04:43,150
No, we don't need redstones!

5178
03:04:43,190 --> 03:04:45,730
Okay, I've been in the mines for so long...

5179
03:04:45,730 --> 03:04:47,690
I keep forgetting what we need and what we don't need now.

5180
03:04:47,970 --> 03:04:49,730
All I see is just cobblestone.

5181
03:04:49,730 --> 03:04:51,810
What if this was beating Minecraft?

5182
03:04:52,250 --> 03:04:53,510
Like, what if the mine...

5183
03:04:53,510 --> 03:04:54,330
That's Minecraft!

5184
03:04:54,930 --> 03:04:56,550
Oh yeah, you're trying to say...

5185
03:04:56,550 --> 03:04:58,310
Do you know the worst part, Mint?

5186
03:04:59,570 --> 03:05:03,270
The nether is supposed to be the hardest part out of this.

5187
03:05:03,550 --> 03:05:06,250
The nether is supposed to be the hardest part.

5188
03:05:06,510 --> 03:05:07,430
Supposed to be.

5189
03:05:08,010 --> 03:05:09,650
All we need are...

5190
03:05:09,650 --> 03:05:12,530
We need some green mushrooms to get rid of the hogs.

5191
03:05:12,850 --> 03:05:13,730
We need some...

5192
03:05:14,570 --> 03:05:17,350
We need some lava to kill hogs.

5193
03:05:17,370 --> 03:05:17,870
Oh, we're good!

5194
03:05:17,870 --> 03:05:19,150
We need some potions.

5195
03:05:19,330 --> 03:05:22,190
We just gotta go find a village with a potion place thing.

5196
03:05:22,190 --> 03:05:22,890
And we're good.

5197
03:05:23,710 --> 03:05:24,170
Okay.

5198
03:05:27,370 --> 03:05:31,390
Yeah, and what if a ghastly comes up to us while we're crossing the...

5199
03:05:31,390 --> 03:05:31,730
A ghastly?

5200
03:05:31,970 --> 03:05:35,410
What game are we playing now?

5201
03:05:35,650 --> 03:05:37,590
Oh, sorry, I have a Cobblemon mod on.

5202
03:05:39,330 --> 03:05:40,710
What if, like...

5203
03:05:40,710 --> 03:05:43,690
What if, you know, the ghast comes in and goes...

5204
03:05:43,690 --> 03:05:45,950
And then, like, we fall into the lava.

5205
03:05:46,630 --> 03:05:47,390
What do we do?

5206
03:05:48,630 --> 03:05:50,490
What if we don't do the shields in time?

5207
03:05:51,310 --> 03:05:51,750
What happens?

5208
03:05:53,950 --> 03:05:55,450
What if I don't do it in time?

5209
03:05:55,590 --> 03:05:57,490
What if I don't do this in time?

5210
03:05:58,210 --> 03:05:59,050
I mean, I can't.

5211
03:05:59,090 --> 03:06:01,030
I don't know what's gonna happen if we die on this run.

5212
03:06:01,150 --> 03:06:02,650
I don't know what's gonna become of me.

5213
03:06:08,090 --> 03:06:10,310
I don't know what's gonna happen to me.

5214
03:06:10,370 --> 03:06:12,050
Because then we have to do this all over again.

5215
03:06:12,150 --> 03:06:13,950
This specific part of the run.

5216
03:06:14,910 --> 03:06:16,590
At that point, I'm not even gonna...

5217
03:06:16,590 --> 03:06:17,870
I don't even wanna...

5218
03:06:17,870 --> 03:06:19,610
At a point, we might as well just do it with Iron.

5219
03:06:19,710 --> 03:06:20,770
I don't care anymore.

5220
03:06:22,010 --> 03:06:23,590
She's really losing it, guys.

5221
03:06:23,870 --> 03:06:24,750
She's so weak!

5222
03:06:25,210 --> 03:06:26,830
It's only been hour three!

5223
03:06:27,510 --> 03:06:28,570
You're dead already!

5224
03:06:31,050 --> 03:06:31,730
You're weak!

5225
03:06:32,850 --> 03:06:33,730
You're dead!

5226
03:06:34,150 --> 03:06:35,750
You're literally a ghost!

5227
03:06:36,190 --> 03:06:37,610
So what does that have to do with it?

5228
03:06:38,010 --> 03:06:40,930
You don't care about dying, because you're already dead.

5229
03:06:40,930 --> 03:06:41,350
Yeah!

5230
03:06:43,290 --> 03:06:44,170
Join me!

5231
03:06:44,390 --> 03:06:46,170
What do you want me to say?

5232
03:06:46,510 --> 03:06:48,690
The strip madness is getting to me.

5233
03:06:49,330 --> 03:06:51,130
Oh, it's already hit.

5234
03:06:51,210 --> 03:06:51,950
It's already hitting.

5235
03:06:55,900 --> 03:06:57,660
How much more can you take?

5236
03:06:58,240 --> 03:07:00,320
Are you still at 15?

5237
03:07:02,640 --> 03:07:04,220
You're still at 15, aren't you?

5238
03:07:04,540 --> 03:07:06,480
You're still at 15, aren't you?

5239
03:07:06,580 --> 03:07:09,340
I just found three more diamonds!

5240
03:07:09,640 --> 03:07:10,400
And you're still...

5241
03:07:12,680 --> 03:07:14,620
I'm doing my best!

5242
03:07:16,080 --> 03:07:17,140
I'm gonna find your hole.

5243
03:07:17,340 --> 03:07:19,400
I'm gonna find your hole and dig that hole.

5244
03:07:20,120 --> 03:07:21,740
I'm fucking coming back.

5245
03:07:23,400 --> 03:07:24,720
Let me dig this.

5246
03:07:24,880 --> 03:07:25,040
Alright.

5247
03:07:26,260 --> 03:07:27,760
Give me your coordinates.

5248
03:07:28,720 --> 03:07:29,240
No!

5249
03:07:29,500 --> 03:07:30,200
Find my hole!

5250
03:07:30,440 --> 03:07:31,480
Give me your coordinates!

5251
03:07:31,960 --> 03:07:32,600
Find my hole!

5252
03:07:33,920 --> 03:07:35,640
I'm coming over.

5253
03:07:35,800 --> 03:07:37,360
I'm running over now.

5254
03:07:37,480 --> 03:07:38,520
You don't even know where I am.

5255
03:07:38,520 --> 03:07:40,580
Oh my god, there's so many holes.

5256
03:07:40,840 --> 03:07:41,620
There's so...

5257
03:07:41,620 --> 03:07:43,480
There's so many holes.

5258
03:07:43,900 --> 03:07:47,220
I'm surprised no monsters spawn into any of these holes that we've created.

5259
03:07:47,440 --> 03:07:48,800
Honestly, I'm surprised too.

5260
03:07:51,120 --> 03:07:51,960
Wait, but seriously.

5261
03:07:52,060 --> 03:07:53,260
How much more can you take?

5262
03:07:54,400 --> 03:07:55,760
I think this is your hole.

5263
03:07:56,020 --> 03:07:57,400
No, this is my hole?

5264
03:07:57,520 --> 03:07:58,920
Oh wait, this is the hole I dug with lava.

5265
03:08:00,020 --> 03:08:00,480
Okay.

5266
03:08:01,440 --> 03:08:02,820
Unless that's my hole with lava.

5267
03:08:03,700 --> 03:08:06,360
How many holes with lava did you find?

5268
03:08:06,360 --> 03:08:07,860
Wait, did you leave a...

5269
03:08:07,860 --> 03:08:08,280
I just need to know.

5270
03:08:08,380 --> 03:08:12,500
Did you leave a hole unattended with like lava?

5271
03:08:13,740 --> 03:08:14,100
Yeah.

5272
03:08:14,420 --> 03:08:15,540
Wait, what do you mean by that?

5273
03:08:15,900 --> 03:08:18,620
Like, did you leave a hole where like...

5274
03:08:18,620 --> 03:08:20,560
I could accidentally walk into?

5275
03:08:20,640 --> 03:08:21,260
Where there's...

5276
03:08:21,260 --> 03:08:22,140
Where it's a pit?

5277
03:08:23,920 --> 03:08:25,520
I don't think so.

5278
03:08:25,600 --> 03:08:26,520
Okay, alright.

5279
03:08:27,280 --> 03:08:28,440
Alright, that's good to know.

5280
03:08:31,100 --> 03:08:31,780
Okay, thank you.

5281
03:08:31,780 --> 03:08:33,380
I think I want to just find one more.

5282
03:08:35,140 --> 03:08:35,680
Okay.

5283
03:08:35,940 --> 03:08:38,140
I'm gonna try and find you right now.

5284
03:08:38,180 --> 03:08:40,380
Oh my god, how long have I been digging?

5285
03:08:41,000 --> 03:08:42,560
This does not stop.

5286
03:08:42,620 --> 03:08:42,980
What?

5287
03:08:43,680 --> 03:08:44,060
This...

5288
03:08:44,060 --> 03:08:46,660
This doesn't stop.

5289
03:08:47,140 --> 03:08:48,320
Holy shit.

5290
03:08:50,600 --> 03:08:51,460
I dug a lot.

5291
03:08:51,980 --> 03:08:53,720
No, I'm still at my hole.

5292
03:08:54,120 --> 03:08:54,300
Oh.

5293
03:08:55,200 --> 03:08:56,740
Damn, Doki, okay.

5294
03:08:57,420 --> 03:08:59,000
Okay, I found your hole.

5295
03:08:59,920 --> 03:09:01,240
I'm pretty sure you have torches.

5296
03:09:01,240 --> 03:09:01,580
Torches, okay.

5297
03:09:02,120 --> 03:09:03,360
Oh, you left this.

5298
03:09:03,940 --> 03:09:05,700
You left the redstone.

5299
03:09:06,300 --> 03:09:07,860
Yep, precious experience.

5300
03:09:08,380 --> 03:09:09,340
You need the experience!

5301
03:09:09,800 --> 03:09:11,120
Oh, the experience, yeah.

5302
03:09:11,380 --> 03:09:13,140
Okay, you put torches in your hole, right?

5303
03:09:13,940 --> 03:09:14,840
Not all of them.

5304
03:09:15,760 --> 03:09:17,760
Alright, this has to be your hole.

5305
03:09:18,160 --> 03:09:19,580
I didn't put any torches in mine.

5306
03:09:22,340 --> 03:09:22,840
Okay.

5307
03:09:23,800 --> 03:09:26,040
Oh my god, this is a long ass hole.

5308
03:09:26,040 --> 03:09:26,620
Oh.

5309
03:09:27,440 --> 03:09:28,740
Okay, you must have one.

5310
03:09:28,840 --> 03:09:31,820
Go into the right one, I've changed a couple times.

5311
03:09:38,680 --> 03:09:39,220
Okay.

5312
03:09:39,940 --> 03:09:41,020
Which one?

5313
03:09:41,160 --> 03:09:42,480
This is the one with lava.

5314
03:09:43,790 --> 03:09:45,780
What the fuck is this?

5315
03:09:46,360 --> 03:09:47,000
It's what?

5316
03:09:50,140 --> 03:09:52,040
Mine is so much more straightforward.

5317
03:09:52,040 --> 03:09:52,600
It's so straightforward.

5318
03:09:53,420 --> 03:09:55,020
Like, what are these?

5319
03:09:55,360 --> 03:09:57,200
Oh my god.

5320
03:09:57,740 --> 03:09:58,940
Oh, did you find my...

5321
03:09:58,940 --> 03:10:02,120
I found your cross section.

5322
03:10:03,500 --> 03:10:05,160
Oh, no, no.

5323
03:10:05,280 --> 03:10:06,740
I ran into your hole.

5324
03:10:07,640 --> 03:10:08,940
Ran into my hole?

5325
03:10:09,300 --> 03:10:11,080
Yeah, at one point I ran into your hole.

5326
03:10:11,720 --> 03:10:13,440
Yeah, but you were in the cross section.

5327
03:10:13,780 --> 03:10:15,140
Wait, why did you stop here?

5328
03:10:15,640 --> 03:10:17,280
Why did you go back here?

5329
03:10:18,660 --> 03:10:20,360
I just wasn't feeling it, I don't know.

5330
03:10:20,940 --> 03:10:21,780
Oh my god.

5331
03:10:21,860 --> 03:10:23,660
You stopped before you hit it big.

5332
03:10:23,800 --> 03:10:25,060
You're like those gamblers.

5333
03:10:26,400 --> 03:10:26,560
What?

5334
03:10:26,740 --> 03:10:27,600
Keep going then.

5335
03:10:27,740 --> 03:10:28,540
Did I hit it big there?

5336
03:10:28,740 --> 03:10:29,280
Did I miss out?

5337
03:10:29,300 --> 03:10:30,400
Alright, I'm gonna do it.

5338
03:10:32,000 --> 03:10:33,580
Wouldn't be funny if you missed out.

5339
03:10:34,160 --> 03:10:34,760
Maybe I did.

5340
03:10:34,860 --> 03:10:36,580
Wouldn't be so funny if you missed out.

5341
03:10:36,600 --> 03:10:37,120
I'm gonna keep digging.

5342
03:10:42,010 --> 03:10:44,330
I'm gonna dig this hole and see if you missed out.

5343
03:10:48,660 --> 03:10:49,040
Okay.

5344
03:10:49,480 --> 03:10:50,120
Yeah, I'm digging.

5345
03:10:50,340 --> 03:10:52,880
I'm digging the hole you fucking stopped at.

5346
03:10:52,880 --> 03:10:55,360
I mean, if you eventually get to something...

5347
03:10:55,360 --> 03:10:57,380
It has to be within like 5 hits.

5348
03:10:58,360 --> 03:10:59,380
5 hits?

5349
03:10:59,680 --> 03:11:00,100
Yeah.

5350
03:11:00,560 --> 03:11:02,860
5 hits, so you're like, you know...

5351
03:11:02,860 --> 03:11:04,500
You're like changing the rules then.

5352
03:11:05,740 --> 03:11:06,160
What?

5353
03:11:06,220 --> 03:11:07,120
No, because...

5354
03:11:07,120 --> 03:11:08,580
That's the meme.

5355
03:11:08,680 --> 03:11:11,780
You hit it big right before you get to it.

5356
03:11:12,020 --> 03:11:15,280
It's not like you hit it big after like 50 hits.

5357
03:11:15,320 --> 03:11:16,200
That's just anybody doing that.

5358
03:11:16,200 --> 03:11:17,220
No, no, no.

5359
03:11:17,340 --> 03:11:19,080
It means you gave up too early.

5360
03:11:20,560 --> 03:11:22,240
You just gave up so easily.

5361
03:11:23,660 --> 03:11:24,420
No, no.

5362
03:11:24,420 --> 03:11:25,280
That's not the meme.

5363
03:11:25,440 --> 03:11:27,920
That doesn't matter.

5364
03:11:28,120 --> 03:11:30,270
It doesn't matter because you're the one that gave up.

5365
03:11:31,300 --> 03:11:32,140
But anybody...

5366
03:11:32,140 --> 03:11:33,420
I didn't give up.

5367
03:11:33,880 --> 03:11:35,880
Who was the one that made the full set of armor?

5368
03:11:36,180 --> 03:11:37,660
Who was the one that made the...

5369
03:11:38,720 --> 03:11:41,440
I stopped digging because I finished my task.

5370
03:11:42,660 --> 03:11:43,240
Oh, what is this?

5371
03:11:43,280 --> 03:11:43,860
Among Us now?

5372
03:11:44,000 --> 03:11:44,980
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

5373
03:11:45,380 --> 03:11:46,960
At least I finished it.

5374
03:11:48,360 --> 03:11:49,880
I finished my goal.

5375
03:11:49,880 --> 03:11:52,120
Somebody hasn't finished their goal.

5376
03:11:52,180 --> 03:11:54,580
I just want to find one more stack.

5377
03:11:54,600 --> 03:11:54,900
Okay?

5378
03:11:55,540 --> 03:11:55,540
God.

5379
03:12:01,400 --> 03:12:02,720
Hello, Redstone Doe.

5380
03:12:03,000 --> 03:12:04,260
I'm almost at level 20.

5381
03:12:05,280 --> 03:12:05,880
Me too.

5382
03:12:06,900 --> 03:12:07,880
What's your level?

5383
03:12:08,520 --> 03:12:09,120
19.

5384
03:12:10,140 --> 03:12:11,840
Just like you said.

5385
03:12:12,140 --> 03:12:13,860
I'm almost at level 20.

5386
03:12:14,340 --> 03:12:15,820
I don't know.

5387
03:12:15,920 --> 03:12:16,820
It could be level 18.

5388
03:12:17,160 --> 03:12:17,640
I don't know.

5389
03:12:17,640 --> 03:12:19,500
Oh, so you're at level 18, huh?

5390
03:12:19,580 --> 03:12:20,760
No, I'm level 19.

5391
03:12:21,240 --> 03:12:23,520
I just thought you weren't good enough to be level 19.

5392
03:12:25,020 --> 03:12:25,420
Okay.

5393
03:12:26,120 --> 03:12:26,520
Yeah.

5394
03:12:33,550 --> 03:12:34,370
Oh my gosh.

5395
03:12:34,430 --> 03:12:35,530
How much more do I have to dig?

5396
03:12:35,670 --> 03:12:36,150
I don't know.

5397
03:12:36,250 --> 03:12:37,670
I'm digging your hole right now.

5398
03:12:37,770 --> 03:12:40,950
Why is it that I'm the one that's more sane than you?

5399
03:12:42,790 --> 03:12:44,350
Because I know we're gonna die.

5400
03:12:45,270 --> 03:12:46,070
I know.

5401
03:12:46,270 --> 03:12:48,190
No, we have to beat this eventually.

5402
03:12:48,190 --> 03:12:50,330
I know this is not the run.

5403
03:12:50,410 --> 03:12:51,790
I know I'm going...

5404
03:12:51,790 --> 03:12:52,970
What do you mean this is not the run?

5405
03:12:53,070 --> 03:12:55,430
You're still the young optimistic.

5406
03:12:56,390 --> 03:12:58,250
You're still young and optimistic.

5407
03:12:58,650 --> 03:12:59,470
But I know.

5408
03:12:59,930 --> 03:13:02,110
I know we're gonna be doing this all over again.

5409
03:13:02,430 --> 03:13:03,730
I know this isn't it.

5410
03:13:05,210 --> 03:13:08,570
Is it because I only have 15 diamonds?

5411
03:13:11,710 --> 03:13:15,270
I know that I have to repeat this all over again.

5412
03:13:15,270 --> 03:13:15,790
Right?

5413
03:13:16,610 --> 03:13:20,950
Well then you can find all the diamonds and just give them to me.

5414
03:13:21,650 --> 03:13:23,310
Since you have better luck.

5415
03:13:23,630 --> 03:13:25,150
I thought this was a team game.

5416
03:13:25,530 --> 03:13:26,550
I thought...

5417
03:13:26,550 --> 03:13:28,450
Clearly I'm not doing well enough.

5418
03:13:28,810 --> 03:13:29,930
I found diamonds.

5419
03:13:30,170 --> 03:13:31,410
I found diamonds in your hole.

5420
03:13:32,650 --> 03:13:35,530
Okay, but that was like 20 minutes later.

5421
03:13:36,250 --> 03:13:37,410
Oh my god.

5422
03:13:37,610 --> 03:13:38,830
It doesn't matter.

5423
03:13:39,150 --> 03:13:40,530
It was so long.

5424
03:13:46,360 --> 03:13:48,100
It was not right there.

5425
03:13:48,100 --> 03:13:48,980
Six.

5426
03:13:49,300 --> 03:13:52,100
Six diamonds in the hole you gave up on.

5427
03:13:53,360 --> 03:13:54,320
Six diamonds.

5428
03:13:57,380 --> 03:13:58,660
You gave up.

5429
03:13:59,240 --> 03:14:01,120
No, no, no.

5430
03:14:01,620 --> 03:14:03,760
This is to teach you a lesson to never give up.

5431
03:14:04,080 --> 03:14:04,640
You gave up.

5432
03:14:10,140 --> 03:14:10,960
I'm still going.

5433
03:14:10,960 --> 03:14:11,340
You gave up.

5434
03:14:12,740 --> 03:14:15,940
I didn't give up because I'm still here and I'm still digging.

5435
03:14:16,320 --> 03:14:18,060
How many times did you change?

5436
03:14:18,060 --> 03:14:19,020
How many times?

5437
03:14:19,820 --> 03:14:23,460
I'm going to go find another one of your pathways that you fucking gave up on.

5438
03:14:23,940 --> 03:14:24,960
Okay, do it.

5439
03:14:25,200 --> 03:14:26,560
Come find me.

5440
03:14:26,640 --> 03:14:27,940
You'll never find me.

5441
03:14:28,180 --> 03:14:29,580
I'll never find you.

5442
03:14:29,780 --> 03:14:31,140
I'll never find you.

5443
03:14:31,140 --> 03:14:32,240
I'm so fucking lost.

5444
03:14:32,340 --> 03:14:35,780
I don't even know which one was the hole I dug and which one was...

5445
03:14:35,780 --> 03:14:37,960
That could have even been your hole then.

5446
03:14:39,480 --> 03:14:41,400
It could have even been your hole.

5447
03:14:41,520 --> 03:14:43,020
No, it's your hole.

5448
03:14:43,460 --> 03:14:43,880
Hey, Min.

5449
03:14:44,380 --> 03:14:47,160
Why do I have some wisps ratting you out in my chat?

5450
03:14:50,020 --> 03:14:50,660
Hey, Min.

5451
03:14:50,720 --> 03:14:52,700
I'm going to dig up.

5452
03:14:52,760 --> 03:14:53,860
I'm going to start digging up.

5453
03:14:53,960 --> 03:14:55,300
Somebody has a full set.

5454
03:14:55,380 --> 03:14:56,080
I'm going to dig up.

5455
03:14:56,140 --> 03:14:58,000
I'll meet you up on the fucking surface.

5456
03:14:58,460 --> 03:15:02,040
I'm going to meet you on the fucking surface, you fucking whore.

5457
03:15:05,700 --> 03:15:07,780
Oh yeah, so loyal.

5458
03:15:09,060 --> 03:15:09,860
So loyal.

5459
03:15:10,920 --> 03:15:15,020
No, it has to be the dragoons coming over to see how much I have left.

5460
03:15:15,660 --> 03:15:18,680
It has to be the dragoons coming over to see how much I have left.

5461
03:15:18,680 --> 03:15:20,180
It has to be the dragoons.

5462
03:15:20,200 --> 03:15:20,920
I'm fucking going.

5463
03:15:21,120 --> 03:15:22,360
I'll see you up on the surface.

5464
03:15:22,520 --> 03:15:23,900
I'll see you up on the surface.

5465
03:15:24,760 --> 03:15:25,060
No!

5466
03:15:28,200 --> 03:15:30,160
I don't know where my... what's it called?

5467
03:15:32,480 --> 03:15:33,800
Dragoons would never...

5468
03:15:34,900 --> 03:15:37,820
No, the dragoons are the ones that ratted me out.

5469
03:15:37,900 --> 03:15:40,220
No, dragoons would never...

5470
03:15:40,220 --> 03:15:41,440
How dare you guys.

5471
03:15:42,080 --> 03:15:43,840
Dragoons would fucking never do that.

5472
03:15:44,260 --> 03:15:44,920
Who snitched?

5473
03:15:44,920 --> 03:15:46,540
Give me names.

5474
03:15:46,560 --> 03:15:47,700
Give me names right now.

5475
03:15:47,820 --> 03:15:49,420
I know all my wisps.

5476
03:15:49,620 --> 03:15:50,240
I'll be able to know.

5477
03:15:52,000 --> 03:15:53,460
I'll be able to...

5478
03:15:53,460 --> 03:15:54,380
Oh yeah?

5479
03:15:54,880 --> 03:15:55,460
Alright.

5480
03:15:57,020 --> 03:15:57,820
Let's see.

5481
03:15:58,880 --> 03:16:00,640
Who was it that snitched?

5482
03:16:01,120 --> 03:16:03,340
Who was it that snitched?

5483
03:16:03,440 --> 03:16:04,900
Eragon Battleborn.

5484
03:16:05,960 --> 03:16:07,220
That's a dragoon.

5485
03:16:07,340 --> 03:16:08,460
No, no, no.

5486
03:16:10,420 --> 03:16:10,940
You know what?

5487
03:16:10,940 --> 03:16:12,940
I bet it's even a wisp goon.

5488
03:16:13,900 --> 03:16:14,960
Oh, they're the worst.

5489
03:16:16,020 --> 03:16:16,960
You know what?

5490
03:16:17,460 --> 03:16:20,660
This person, they're not even a member.

5491
03:16:20,920 --> 03:16:22,180
But I bet they're a member in your chat.

5492
03:16:22,360 --> 03:16:23,380
Check if they're a member in your chat.

5493
03:16:24,300 --> 03:16:26,300
Eragon, show up on Mint's chat right now.

5494
03:16:27,000 --> 03:16:28,400
I want to see if you're a member.

5495
03:16:29,440 --> 03:16:30,580
I want to see.

5496
03:16:30,960 --> 03:16:33,040
I want to see.

5497
03:16:33,340 --> 03:16:35,460
Eragon was not a member in my chat.

5498
03:16:35,780 --> 03:16:36,700
They're not a member.

5499
03:16:36,700 --> 03:16:38,700
They're a gifted...

5500
03:16:38,700 --> 03:16:40,580
Oh my god, you have a gifted member?

5501
03:16:40,780 --> 03:16:42,180
Show yourself, Eragon.

5502
03:16:42,780 --> 03:16:43,680
I can't see them.

5503
03:16:44,340 --> 03:16:45,900
Stop gifting memberships.

5504
03:16:50,040 --> 03:16:52,760
They said I'm an SSRB.

5505
03:16:53,060 --> 03:16:53,380
What is that?

5506
03:16:54,760 --> 03:16:55,240
SSRB?

5507
03:16:55,940 --> 03:16:56,820
Are they a member?

5508
03:16:58,540 --> 03:16:59,600
No, they're not a member.

5509
03:17:00,020 --> 03:17:00,980
Okay, okay.

5510
03:17:03,060 --> 03:17:04,580
They're like an inside job.

5511
03:17:04,580 --> 03:17:07,400
Oh, they're a fan of Botan.

5512
03:17:07,520 --> 03:17:08,580
You're not even watching.

5513
03:17:11,660 --> 03:17:12,500
We're Indies.

5514
03:17:12,680 --> 03:17:13,360
Get out of here.

5515
03:17:14,100 --> 03:17:15,140
It was a Psycopse.

5516
03:17:15,220 --> 03:17:22,280
It was a Psycopse all along.

5517
03:17:25,920 --> 03:17:29,500
What's so sad is that they wouldn't even say like, Yeah, I'm a fan of you.

5518
03:17:32,700 --> 03:17:34,280
Not even for the bit.

5519
03:17:36,160 --> 03:17:38,880
Oh my god, we're at minus 26 right now.

5520
03:17:39,260 --> 03:17:40,260
You're at minus 26?

5521
03:17:40,560 --> 03:17:41,740
I think the worst part...

5522
03:17:41,740 --> 03:17:44,560
Oh my god, I hope we dig up to the fucking...

5523
03:17:44,560 --> 03:17:45,400
Not to the mountain.

5524
03:17:45,540 --> 03:17:47,720
I hope we got out of the mountain area.

5525
03:17:48,920 --> 03:17:50,500
Well, once you get to...

5526
03:17:50,500 --> 03:17:52,080
Something, just dig.

5527
03:17:52,760 --> 03:17:53,080
Over.

5528
03:17:53,700 --> 03:17:55,760
Okay, I don't know if I'm in the mountain, though.

5529
03:17:55,780 --> 03:17:56,300
That's the thing.

5530
03:17:56,300 --> 03:17:58,020
Oh wait, I'm gonna start taking my torches back.

5531
03:17:58,680 --> 03:18:00,140
Are you not digging up?

5532
03:18:00,700 --> 03:18:01,080
No.

5533
03:18:01,660 --> 03:18:03,620
I guess I could get some.

5534
03:18:03,700 --> 03:18:04,640
I could've done everything.

5535
03:18:05,220 --> 03:18:06,240
I'll dig eventually.

5536
03:18:07,940 --> 03:18:09,560
I'm waiting for you in the surface.

5537
03:18:11,800 --> 03:18:13,340
You're only prolonging your torture.

5538
03:18:14,620 --> 03:18:15,420
Your torture?

5539
03:18:15,540 --> 03:18:16,140
I'm fine.

5540
03:18:16,480 --> 03:18:17,260
You're only prolonging...

5541
03:18:17,260 --> 03:18:19,060
You think you're gonna be fine, Tia?

5542
03:18:20,220 --> 03:18:21,920
What do you mean by that?

5543
03:18:22,400 --> 03:18:23,960
You think you're gonna be fine.

5544
03:18:23,960 --> 03:18:26,060
And then we're gonna do like 20 more of this.

5545
03:18:26,140 --> 03:18:27,540
And then you're gonna be like...

5546
03:18:27,540 --> 03:18:29,540
Oh my god, Doki, why did I...

5547
03:18:31,240 --> 03:18:34,100
Okay, I'm getting to a safe spot.

5548
03:18:39,540 --> 03:18:40,560
What did they say?

5549
03:18:41,100 --> 03:18:41,900
What did they say?

5550
03:18:42,180 --> 03:18:44,500
Why are you saying LOL at them?

5551
03:18:45,180 --> 03:18:45,980
Wait, what?

5552
03:18:46,300 --> 03:18:47,140
I don't know.

5553
03:18:47,320 --> 03:18:50,460
Where did I dig to?

5554
03:18:50,760 --> 03:18:51,780
Is this another cave?

5555
03:18:53,680 --> 03:18:54,400
Don't die.

5556
03:18:54,920 --> 03:18:56,240
You better not die.

5557
03:18:56,340 --> 03:18:58,000
You have diamond armor.

5558
03:18:58,220 --> 03:18:58,620
You're good.

5559
03:18:59,700 --> 03:19:02,620
You don't want to prolong this?

5560
03:19:02,660 --> 03:19:03,340
What happened, man?

5561
03:19:03,420 --> 03:19:04,840
I thought you wanted to do more mining.

5562
03:19:05,040 --> 03:19:07,620
No, we're still playing.

5563
03:19:08,040 --> 03:19:10,520
I thought you loved mining.

5564
03:19:11,280 --> 03:19:12,260
Oh, you left some...

5565
03:19:12,260 --> 03:19:14,560
Some sweet, sweet...

5566
03:19:15,260 --> 03:19:15,720
Experience.

5567
03:19:17,140 --> 03:19:18,280
Oh wow, there's a lot here, actually.

5568
03:19:19,280 --> 03:19:20,610
You left all the redstone.

5569
03:19:20,610 --> 03:19:21,230
Redstone.

5570
03:19:21,990 --> 03:19:24,690
Oh no, not the fucking redstone.

5571
03:19:24,890 --> 03:19:25,930
Oh no.

5572
03:19:28,610 --> 03:19:29,150
Doki.

5573
03:19:29,710 --> 03:19:30,690
It's okay, I have diamond armor.

5574
03:19:31,170 --> 03:19:31,730
You're alive.

5575
03:19:33,590 --> 03:19:36,930
I just took a creeper hit in the face.

5576
03:19:37,170 --> 03:19:38,430
But like, I'm...

5577
03:19:38,430 --> 03:19:40,170
You have a shield?

5578
03:19:40,370 --> 03:19:41,210
You also have a shield?

5579
03:19:41,230 --> 03:19:43,610
Yeah, but I have my pickaxe and torches out.

5580
03:19:43,710 --> 03:19:44,390
But it's okay.

5581
03:19:46,370 --> 03:19:49,210
I'm scared to go up like this, man.

5582
03:19:49,210 --> 03:19:51,470
It's okay, everything is fine.

5583
03:19:51,770 --> 03:19:53,570
I took a...

5584
03:19:53,570 --> 03:19:54,890
Creeper shot to the face.

5585
03:19:54,990 --> 03:19:55,910
But it's okay.

5586
03:19:56,910 --> 03:19:58,710
You're fine, probably it's fine.

5587
03:20:04,050 --> 03:20:06,310
I took two creeper hits in the face, by the way.

5588
03:20:06,730 --> 03:20:08,610
Why don't you use your shield?

5589
03:20:11,790 --> 03:20:13,690
You know what, I'm not scared anymore.

5590
03:20:13,850 --> 03:20:14,830
I literally took two creeper...

5591
03:20:14,830 --> 03:20:17,870
I took two creeper hits in the face and I'm okay.

5592
03:20:19,210 --> 03:20:20,770
That's why we get the armor.

5593
03:20:20,770 --> 03:20:23,210
See, you were like, oh, I wanna do this with iron.

5594
03:20:23,430 --> 03:20:24,530
No, no, no.

5595
03:20:26,130 --> 03:20:27,050
Look at that.

5596
03:20:28,630 --> 03:20:30,170
Look at that.

5597
03:20:30,230 --> 03:20:33,110
This is why we do things with diamond armor.

5598
03:20:33,350 --> 03:20:33,710
Duh.

5599
03:20:34,110 --> 03:20:36,770
Oh my God, I thought that was a creeper again.

5600
03:20:36,970 --> 03:20:37,530
I don't know.

5601
03:20:38,090 --> 03:20:39,610
I'm seeing things now.

5602
03:20:40,190 --> 03:20:41,910
I'm seeing things, guys.

5603
03:20:42,730 --> 03:20:44,030
I wanna leave here.

5604
03:20:44,110 --> 03:20:45,090
I'm sick of mining.

5605
03:20:45,610 --> 03:20:47,590
Oh, now you're sick of mining.

5606
03:20:50,770 --> 03:20:54,210
Oh, you're so sick of mining now.

5607
03:20:54,410 --> 03:20:56,250
I hate mining, it's boring.

5608
03:21:02,170 --> 03:21:03,770
Oh my God.

5609
03:21:04,790 --> 03:21:06,370
I don't even know where I am.

5610
03:21:10,270 --> 03:21:11,250
Witch giggles?

5611
03:21:11,530 --> 03:21:12,050
Oh shit.

5612
03:21:12,190 --> 03:21:13,250
Okay, I might be in trouble.

5613
03:21:13,970 --> 03:21:15,970
Wait, do you have subtitles on?

5614
03:21:16,530 --> 03:21:17,190
Yeah, of course.

5615
03:21:17,190 --> 03:21:18,010
Oh, I should have that.

5616
03:21:19,350 --> 03:21:20,890
I should have that too.

5617
03:21:20,990 --> 03:21:22,150
Yeah, you should have that.

5618
03:21:22,830 --> 03:21:24,050
Where's the subtitles at?

5619
03:21:24,130 --> 03:21:24,710
Chat settings?

5620
03:21:25,350 --> 03:21:25,670
No.

5621
03:21:25,910 --> 03:21:27,790
I don't remember, guys.

5622
03:21:28,070 --> 03:21:28,510
Accessibility?

5623
03:21:28,710 --> 03:21:29,310
Oh, there we go.

5624
03:21:30,730 --> 03:21:31,790
That's a good idea.

5625
03:21:32,830 --> 03:21:34,330
Okay, I gotta get out of here.

5626
03:21:37,210 --> 03:21:38,510
I'm at negative 42.

5627
03:21:38,830 --> 03:21:40,330
You're at negative 42?

5628
03:21:40,730 --> 03:21:41,730
I'm at 33.

5629
03:21:43,110 --> 03:21:44,450
I'm in a bad spot.

5630
03:21:44,890 --> 03:21:46,850
Oh my God, there's a witch right next to me.

5631
03:21:46,950 --> 03:21:47,550
Oh shit.

5632
03:21:47,650 --> 03:21:50,570
Wait, am I like... Shouldn't I be in the surface now?

5633
03:21:51,170 --> 03:21:52,130
I'm at 33.

5634
03:21:52,290 --> 03:21:54,010
You're probably... We're in the mountains.

5635
03:21:54,290 --> 03:21:56,230
We're still in the fucking mountains?

5636
03:21:57,290 --> 03:21:57,650
Probably.

5637
03:21:57,650 --> 03:21:59,050
Just dig to the side.

5638
03:21:59,810 --> 03:22:00,590
I'm gonna dig to the side.

5639
03:22:00,610 --> 03:22:02,570
Actually, 33 is not very high.

5640
03:22:03,610 --> 03:22:03,970
Maybe...

5641
03:22:03,970 --> 03:22:05,810
Wait, I found... Wait, there's like...

5642
03:22:05,810 --> 03:22:08,290
Not found, there's like dirt in front of me.

5643
03:22:10,130 --> 03:22:10,770
Oh, see?

5644
03:22:10,910 --> 03:22:11,550
Then you might be good.

5645
03:22:11,550 --> 03:22:12,690
Might be close then.

5646
03:22:14,190 --> 03:22:15,350
Nevermind, the dirt stopped.

5647
03:22:16,050 --> 03:22:17,230
The dirt stopped.

5648
03:22:17,450 --> 03:22:18,970
Oh, surface is at 60 plus.

5649
03:22:19,050 --> 03:22:19,430
Keep going.

5650
03:22:19,570 --> 03:22:20,510
Oh, God.

5651
03:22:21,270 --> 03:22:21,990
Fucking... Okay.

5652
03:22:24,270 --> 03:22:25,390
I'll keep going then.

5653
03:22:25,450 --> 03:22:25,710
Maybe I'm good.

5654
03:22:28,210 --> 03:22:29,110
Maybe I'm okay.

5655
03:22:30,850 --> 03:22:31,590
Oh my God.

5656
03:22:34,310 --> 03:22:35,810
Oh, I'm gonna...

5657
03:22:36,370 --> 03:22:37,310
You're gonna what?

5658
03:22:37,770 --> 03:22:38,950
I'm gonna cry.

5659
03:22:41,890 --> 03:22:43,330
You won't like it...

5660
03:22:43,330 --> 03:22:44,090
When I cry.

5661
03:22:47,270 --> 03:22:48,270
That's so mean.

5662
03:22:48,850 --> 03:22:50,390
Then it'll be too real.

5663
03:22:51,350 --> 03:22:52,830
It'll be too real.

5664
03:22:54,850 --> 03:22:55,690
I'll cry.

5665
03:22:56,010 --> 03:22:57,190
Okay, that's another room.

5666
03:22:57,370 --> 03:22:58,190
Oh my God, no.

5667
03:22:58,790 --> 03:23:00,650
Get me out of these stupid ass rooms.

5668
03:23:04,850 --> 03:23:06,370
Oh my God, I hear the witch still.

5669
03:23:06,530 --> 03:23:08,970
How do you still hear the witch?

5670
03:23:09,990 --> 03:23:11,510
I'm trying to get out of here.

5671
03:23:13,690 --> 03:23:14,550
I'm digging around.

5672
03:23:14,730 --> 03:23:16,430
I'm strip mining again.

5673
03:23:17,950 --> 03:23:18,710
Oh, diamond.

5674
03:23:19,690 --> 03:23:21,950
You're still strip mining.

5675
03:23:23,230 --> 03:23:24,750
I'm trying to get out of here.

5676
03:23:25,370 --> 03:23:25,730
I'm trying.

5677
03:23:26,830 --> 03:23:29,150
Your grandchildren will live in these mines.

5678
03:23:29,850 --> 03:23:31,470
It's okay, I got a lot of diamond here.

5679
03:23:31,950 --> 03:23:33,630
It would be a shame if you died.

5680
03:23:38,570 --> 03:23:39,010
Maybe...

5681
03:23:39,010 --> 03:23:39,390
You know what?

5682
03:23:39,390 --> 03:23:40,470
I'm just gonna build a staircase.

5683
03:23:40,470 --> 03:23:42,390
Oh, yeah.

5684
03:23:42,670 --> 03:23:44,010
Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit.

5685
03:23:44,970 --> 03:23:46,150
Nevermind, nevermind, nevermind.

5686
03:23:48,290 --> 03:23:49,490
Oh, look at that.

5687
03:23:50,030 --> 03:23:51,530
I'll see you in the surface.

5688
03:23:52,210 --> 03:23:53,590
I'll see you on the surface.

5689
03:23:54,030 --> 03:23:54,850
I'm almost there.

5690
03:23:56,350 --> 03:23:57,770
I am at...

5691
03:23:58,370 --> 03:23:58,850
62.

5692
03:24:02,150 --> 03:24:04,630
I don't wanna be in here by myself.

5693
03:24:05,130 --> 03:24:07,030
Then maybe you shouldn't have been...

5694
03:24:07,030 --> 03:24:09,190
Maybe you shouldn't have fucked with me, man.

5695
03:24:09,190 --> 03:24:12,930
Maybe you should've pretended you didn't have any diamonds on you.

5696
03:24:14,270 --> 03:24:16,170
You should've come found me.

5697
03:24:16,330 --> 03:24:17,430
You said you were going to.

5698
03:24:17,730 --> 03:24:18,050
What happened?

5699
03:24:19,610 --> 03:24:20,490
You lied.

5700
03:24:24,900 --> 03:24:27,170
I keep hitting... I just keep hitting cave.

5701
03:24:27,610 --> 03:24:28,490
That's karma.

5702
03:24:28,830 --> 03:24:30,310
That's actually karma.

5703
03:24:34,510 --> 03:24:36,070
Little by little.

5704
03:24:36,070 --> 03:24:37,950
I can't always hit a cave.

5705
03:24:38,510 --> 03:24:39,650
Right, guys?

5706
03:24:42,030 --> 03:24:42,970
Little by little.

5707
03:24:44,970 --> 03:24:46,230
It'll be a shame.

5708
03:24:47,330 --> 03:24:48,030
What, you want me to die?

5709
03:24:48,170 --> 03:24:48,610
I will.

5710
03:24:49,350 --> 03:24:49,750
Do it.

5711
03:24:50,950 --> 03:24:52,190
I asked you.

5712
03:24:52,350 --> 03:24:52,690
Do it.

5713
03:24:54,950 --> 03:24:56,490
I don't want to.

5714
03:24:57,410 --> 03:24:59,170
I knew you wouldn't.

5715
03:24:59,670 --> 03:25:00,210
I'm a ghost.

5716
03:25:00,290 --> 03:25:00,870
I'm already dead.

5717
03:25:00,950 --> 03:25:02,230
I want to appreciate life.

5718
03:25:02,230 --> 03:25:03,670
You don't appreciate life.

5719
03:25:04,550 --> 03:25:06,870
You just want me to waste my...

5720
03:25:06,870 --> 03:25:09,350
I don't appreciate life.

5721
03:25:09,410 --> 03:25:10,490
I'm almost there.

5722
03:25:10,590 --> 03:25:11,590
Calm down.

5723
03:25:11,810 --> 03:25:12,470
What number?

5724
03:25:12,970 --> 03:25:13,490
20.

5725
03:25:19,060 --> 03:25:20,460
I'm at level 20.

5726
03:25:21,280 --> 03:25:22,580
Why are you at 20?

5727
03:25:22,760 --> 03:25:25,200
I'm at level... I'm talking about leveling.

5728
03:25:25,860 --> 03:25:27,160
No, I was talking about...

5729
03:25:27,860 --> 03:25:29,220
I'm at level 21.

5730
03:25:29,580 --> 03:25:30,160
Oh my God.

5731
03:25:32,140 --> 03:25:33,640
Well, I was testing you.

5732
03:25:33,640 --> 03:25:35,340
I was actually level 22.

5733
03:25:39,520 --> 03:25:41,860
Okay, let's from now on...

5734
03:25:41,860 --> 03:25:42,360
No lies.

5735
03:25:43,320 --> 03:25:45,520
That's a fucking lie already.

5736
03:25:46,020 --> 03:25:47,480
What do you mean?

5737
03:25:47,540 --> 03:25:48,420
No, we're teamwork.

5738
03:25:49,400 --> 03:25:50,120
We're teamwork.

5739
03:25:50,500 --> 03:25:51,560
Make the dream work.

5740
03:25:51,560 --> 03:25:53,640
Let's not lie, guys.

5741
03:25:55,000 --> 03:25:55,940
And I didn't lie.

5742
03:25:56,280 --> 03:25:57,940
I just didn't tell you...

5743
03:25:57,940 --> 03:25:59,220
how much I had.

5744
03:25:59,900 --> 03:26:01,540
You assumed every time.

5745
03:26:01,540 --> 03:26:03,700
I literally asked you.

5746
03:26:03,780 --> 03:26:04,360
I was like...

5747
03:26:04,360 --> 03:26:05,840
How many do you have?

5748
03:26:06,760 --> 03:26:08,740
And I was like...

5749
03:26:08,740 --> 03:26:09,820
Do you still have 15?

5750
03:26:10,080 --> 03:26:11,060
And you're like...

5751
03:26:12,160 --> 03:26:14,020
I'm in the surface now.

5752
03:26:14,760 --> 03:26:16,960
I'm at the surface.

5753
03:26:17,220 --> 03:26:18,300
I'm literally... I'm here.

5754
03:26:18,960 --> 03:26:19,760
I'm almost there.

5755
03:26:19,840 --> 03:26:20,480
Oh my God.

5756
03:26:20,560 --> 03:26:21,040
No, you're not.

5757
03:26:23,280 --> 03:26:24,120
What number?

5758
03:26:25,960 --> 03:26:27,080
I'm at...

5759
03:26:27,080 --> 03:26:27,740
2.

5760
03:26:27,740 --> 03:26:27,820
2.

5761
03:26:29,780 --> 03:26:31,760
Didn't you just say you were at 20 earlier?

5762
03:26:31,940 --> 03:26:33,940
Didn't you tell me so you lied and...

5763
03:26:33,940 --> 03:26:35,820
No, I said negative 20.

5764
03:26:36,180 --> 03:26:37,660
Oh, I hit not big rock.

5765
03:26:37,760 --> 03:26:37,900
Okay.

5766
03:26:39,080 --> 03:26:40,300
Or the regular rocks.

5767
03:26:41,220 --> 03:26:42,720
This will go so much faster now.

5768
03:26:43,000 --> 03:26:44,320
Do you have a bed on you?

5769
03:26:45,020 --> 03:26:45,500
A bed?

5770
03:26:45,880 --> 03:26:46,100
Yeah.

5771
03:26:46,620 --> 03:26:48,180
Okay, it's almost night.

5772
03:26:48,400 --> 03:26:49,600
Yeah, you gotta sleep now.

5773
03:26:50,020 --> 03:26:50,700
Okay, I'll sleep.

5774
03:26:50,880 --> 03:26:51,080
I'll sleep.

5775
03:26:52,760 --> 03:26:53,560
I'm sleeping.

5776
03:26:53,940 --> 03:26:54,760
Why aren't you sleeping?

5777
03:26:54,760 --> 03:26:56,760
Oh, there you go.

5778
03:26:57,280 --> 03:26:57,700
I'm sleeping.

5779
03:26:58,460 --> 03:27:00,540
Also, you didn't say negative 20, by the way.

5780
03:27:00,860 --> 03:27:01,860
You said 20.

5781
03:27:03,480 --> 03:27:05,200
You said 20.

5782
03:27:06,120 --> 03:27:06,680
W.

5783
03:27:07,080 --> 03:27:08,720
Might I remind you...

5784
03:27:08,720 --> 03:27:10,520
You wanted to do this collab with me.

5785
03:27:11,740 --> 03:27:13,360
Might I remind you...

5786
03:27:13,360 --> 03:27:15,020
Might I remind you...

5787
03:27:15,020 --> 03:27:17,360
That you were very excited to do this.

5788
03:27:17,740 --> 03:27:18,140
I am.

5789
03:27:18,200 --> 03:27:18,820
I'm still excited.

5790
03:27:19,260 --> 03:27:20,040
Are you not excited?

5791
03:27:21,340 --> 03:27:22,800
You're the one who's crying.

5792
03:27:22,800 --> 03:27:24,500
I'm so excited.

5793
03:27:25,240 --> 03:27:27,060
I'm so excited.

5794
03:27:29,360 --> 03:27:30,060
Let's see.

5795
03:27:30,160 --> 03:27:31,220
I'm at...

5796
03:27:31,220 --> 03:27:31,920
11.

5797
03:27:32,540 --> 03:27:33,220
I'm almost there.

5798
03:27:35,680 --> 03:27:36,800
I'm at...

5799
03:27:36,800 --> 03:27:38,860
I was at 101...

5800
03:27:38,860 --> 03:27:39,560
To get here.

5801
03:27:40,880 --> 03:27:41,980
We're on a mountain.

5802
03:27:43,120 --> 03:27:44,300
You might not be, actually.

5803
03:27:44,480 --> 03:27:47,220
You might have dug further away from me.

5804
03:27:47,320 --> 03:27:47,760
I think...

5805
03:27:47,760 --> 03:27:48,740
Wait.

5806
03:27:48,740 --> 03:27:48,860
Wait.

5807
03:27:49,340 --> 03:27:50,240
What's your...

5808
03:27:50,240 --> 03:27:50,900
What's your...

5809
03:27:54,100 --> 03:27:55,440
X and Z?

5810
03:27:56,560 --> 03:27:57,180
Hold on.

5811
03:27:57,640 --> 03:27:58,980
Oh, that was water dripping.

5812
03:27:59,440 --> 03:28:01,280
I'm at...

5813
03:28:03,200 --> 03:28:04,240
Negative 3558...

5814
03:28:04,240 --> 03:28:06,940
And 1771, but I'm having to change it.

5815
03:28:08,940 --> 03:28:09,460
3558.

5816
03:28:09,780 --> 03:28:10,960
Guys, remember that for me.

5817
03:28:11,780 --> 03:28:14,240
Well, I'm digging, like, not up up.

5818
03:28:14,660 --> 03:28:16,740
I'm digging through...

5819
03:28:16,740 --> 03:28:18,000
I'm digging, like, what's it called?

5820
03:28:18,600 --> 03:28:19,220
A staircase.

5821
03:28:20,140 --> 03:28:21,220
Wait, what's your Z again?

5822
03:28:22,300 --> 03:28:26,700
Guys, what's your Z, guys?

5823
03:28:26,900 --> 03:28:27,540
What's your Z?

5824
03:28:28,320 --> 03:28:28,920
My Z?

5825
03:28:29,420 --> 03:28:30,780
I don't know.

5826
03:28:30,880 --> 03:28:31,340
Hold on.

5827
03:28:34,420 --> 03:28:34,900
1771.

5828
03:28:35,480 --> 03:28:35,900
Okay.

5829
03:28:36,460 --> 03:28:37,540
I need to go this way then.

5830
03:28:38,600 --> 03:28:39,280
Yeah, you're far.

5831
03:28:40,520 --> 03:28:41,000
No!

5832
03:28:41,620 --> 03:28:43,700
I threw away my bombs!

5833
03:28:45,480 --> 03:28:46,660
Could've grabbed a dog.

5834
03:28:46,660 --> 03:28:48,220
You could've grabbed a dog.

5835
03:28:48,320 --> 03:28:50,520
I'm afraid I'm towering from here.

5836
03:28:51,120 --> 03:28:52,400
What if there's someone up there?

5837
03:28:52,540 --> 03:28:54,200
Oh my God, you're so far.

5838
03:28:56,300 --> 03:28:57,200
I'm scared.

5839
03:28:57,480 --> 03:28:58,480
Okay, I'll do a little bit.

5840
03:29:00,860 --> 03:29:01,080
Oh.

5841
03:29:01,660 --> 03:29:04,560
Yeah, you might not hit the mountain, because you're really far.

5842
03:29:05,100 --> 03:29:05,600
I am?

5843
03:29:06,020 --> 03:29:07,680
Yeah, you're far from where I dug up.

5844
03:29:08,040 --> 03:29:08,340
Okay.

5845
03:29:09,780 --> 03:29:10,740
Oh God.

5846
03:29:13,310 --> 03:29:14,590
I'm trying, I'm trying.

5847
03:29:14,590 --> 03:29:16,310
I'm just gonna...

5848
03:29:16,310 --> 03:29:17,970
It's fine, we can do here.

5849
03:29:18,870 --> 03:29:19,970
First, I'll grab the iron.

5850
03:29:20,930 --> 03:29:21,690
Alright, I'm heading over.

5851
03:29:21,970 --> 03:29:22,650
I can staircase from here.

5852
03:29:25,110 --> 03:29:26,350
I'm heading over.

5853
03:29:27,150 --> 03:29:29,350
I'm heading over to where you're gonna show up.

5854
03:29:29,650 --> 03:29:32,210
I might be different though, because I'm staircasing.

5855
03:29:32,650 --> 03:29:35,810
Are you not staircasing, like, the same direction?

5856
03:29:36,490 --> 03:29:39,030
I have to switch, because I just hit a big cave.

5857
03:29:39,230 --> 03:29:40,430
Okay, what's your number now?

5858
03:29:42,570 --> 03:29:44,470
I'm heading towards...

5859
03:29:45,690 --> 03:29:46,070
Numbers.

5860
03:29:46,790 --> 03:29:47,170
1767.

5861
03:29:48,390 --> 03:29:48,770
1767.

5862
03:29:49,010 --> 03:29:50,450
No, I'm still heading the right way.

5863
03:29:52,350 --> 03:29:53,110
1767, okay.

5864
03:29:54,410 --> 03:29:55,590
Okay, you might actually dig a mountain.

5865
03:29:55,710 --> 03:29:56,930
Oh, you are on top of a mountain.

5866
03:29:57,170 --> 03:30:00,430
You're in the mountain.

5867
03:30:01,390 --> 03:30:01,970
You're in the mountain.

5868
03:30:02,170 --> 03:30:04,330
You're in the big ass mountain.

5869
03:30:04,450 --> 03:30:05,390
I'm at 34.

5870
03:30:07,370 --> 03:30:09,310
I'm climbing, it's 99.

5871
03:30:09,310 --> 03:30:09,430
It's 99.

5872
03:30:12,690 --> 03:30:14,270
You might need to get out of that.

5873
03:30:15,450 --> 03:30:16,790
I'm climbing, I'm climbing too.

5874
03:30:17,170 --> 03:30:18,010
Oh, shit.

5875
03:30:18,950 --> 03:30:20,690
Stupid ass cave.

5876
03:30:23,150 --> 03:30:24,190
You're actually...

5877
03:30:24,930 --> 03:30:28,470
Oh, I see the surface, kind of.

5878
03:30:30,530 --> 03:30:33,250
Okay, yeah, you're literally on top of a mountain.

5879
03:30:34,810 --> 03:30:37,590
On top of a mountain.

5880
03:30:41,060 --> 03:30:41,460
Jesus.

5881
03:30:43,140 --> 03:30:45,060
By the way, you gotta dig 133.

5882
03:30:45,800 --> 03:30:46,940
If you wanna get it.

5883
03:30:47,820 --> 03:30:49,380
I'm at 47.

5884
03:30:49,680 --> 03:30:50,880
I'm close, I'm close.

5885
03:30:51,800 --> 03:30:52,980
I'm close, I'm close, I'm close.

5886
03:30:53,060 --> 03:30:55,280
I'll wait for you at the top of the mountain.

5887
03:30:55,640 --> 03:30:56,580
Okay, okay, okay.

5888
03:30:58,720 --> 03:31:00,260
Wait, where are you at?

5889
03:31:00,440 --> 03:31:02,200
I'm at 1757.

5890
03:31:05,040 --> 03:31:05,520
1757.

5891
03:31:06,280 --> 03:31:06,980
Let's see.

5892
03:31:07,100 --> 03:31:08,480
17, yeah, I'm at 17.

5893
03:31:08,480 --> 03:31:09,580
What's your X again?

5894
03:31:11,040 --> 03:31:11,900
What's your X?

5895
03:31:11,900 --> 03:31:12,900
I'm at 3579.

5896
03:31:14,640 --> 03:31:16,220
Are you right there?

5897
03:31:20,920 --> 03:31:22,500
Guys, what was the Z again?

5898
03:31:25,700 --> 03:31:26,760
What's the Z?

5899
03:31:29,760 --> 03:31:31,580
Are you right on top of me?

5900
03:31:33,740 --> 03:31:35,060
Oh, it's okay, I'm at 60.

5901
03:31:35,240 --> 03:31:35,880
I'm almost there.

5902
03:31:38,480 --> 03:31:39,660
I'm almost there.

5903
03:31:40,460 --> 03:31:41,560
I'm almost there.

5904
03:31:43,180 --> 03:31:45,960
Yeah, you're definitely almost there.

5905
03:31:46,340 --> 03:31:47,900
I'm playing the game.

5906
03:31:48,060 --> 03:31:48,940
Why does it get higher?

5907
03:31:49,880 --> 03:31:52,380
Wait, what's your X and Y?

5908
03:31:53,700 --> 03:31:55,060
I'm not telling you anymore.

5909
03:31:55,460 --> 03:31:56,560
What do you mean?

5910
03:31:57,600 --> 03:31:58,740
You're gonna make fun of me.

5911
03:32:05,120 --> 03:32:06,300
I'm almost there.

5912
03:32:06,300 --> 03:32:08,560
I can feel it.

5913
03:32:09,360 --> 03:32:10,800
I can feel it.

5914
03:32:10,880 --> 03:32:11,720
You can feel it?

5915
03:32:12,100 --> 03:32:13,520
I'm over halfway.

5916
03:32:13,940 --> 03:32:16,120
What's your Y?

5917
03:32:18,260 --> 03:32:21,960
If I keep stopping to tell you, I won't keep digging.

5918
03:32:26,200 --> 03:32:28,900
Nice, I got lots of coal.

5919
03:32:31,360 --> 03:32:33,360
This is a lot of coal.

5920
03:32:33,360 --> 03:32:34,540
Holy moly.

5921
03:32:35,140 --> 03:32:42,260
Oh my gosh, there's so much coal here.

5922
03:32:44,980 --> 03:32:46,240
That's insane.

5923
03:32:47,700 --> 03:32:49,000
There's so much coal.

5924
03:32:49,160 --> 03:32:50,520
Okay, I'm level 50 now.

5925
03:32:54,440 --> 03:32:55,140
What?

5926
03:32:57,300 --> 03:32:59,300
Okay, I'll give up.

5927
03:32:59,920 --> 03:33:00,260
What?

5928
03:33:00,400 --> 03:33:01,980
Why are you giving up?

5929
03:33:03,360 --> 03:33:03,620
What?

5930
03:33:05,300 --> 03:33:07,280
I don't even need to do what I was doing.

5931
03:33:07,540 --> 03:33:09,460
I still have a long way to go.

5932
03:33:10,640 --> 03:33:11,640
I'm almost there.

5933
03:33:13,080 --> 03:33:15,400
Oh yeah, that's why I'm not telling you my location.

5934
03:33:15,640 --> 03:33:16,980
Because that's what you'll fucking do.

5935
03:33:17,500 --> 03:33:18,420
Do what?

5936
03:33:18,720 --> 03:33:20,040
You'll sabotage me.

5937
03:33:20,060 --> 03:33:21,300
How would I sabotage you?

5938
03:33:21,320 --> 03:33:23,000
You already sabotaged yourself.

5939
03:33:23,600 --> 03:33:24,960
How would I sabotage myself?

5940
03:33:25,060 --> 03:33:26,480
You already sabotaged...

5941
03:33:26,480 --> 03:33:27,580
You'll find out.

5942
03:33:27,720 --> 03:33:29,900
You'll find out when you get to the top.

5943
03:33:29,900 --> 03:33:31,580
Oh, is it night time?

5944
03:33:32,420 --> 03:33:32,980
No.

5945
03:33:33,640 --> 03:33:34,800
That's not it.

5946
03:33:35,640 --> 03:33:36,200
What?

5947
03:33:37,440 --> 03:33:38,320
Oh, am I underwater?

5948
03:33:39,620 --> 03:33:40,820
You'll find out.

5949
03:33:41,960 --> 03:33:44,640
You'll find out when you get to the top.

5950
03:33:49,660 --> 03:33:52,080
How much are you adding to the top of the mountain?

5951
03:33:52,280 --> 03:33:53,580
I don't need to.

5952
03:33:55,660 --> 03:33:56,800
What do you mean?

5953
03:33:56,800 --> 03:33:58,500
You don't even know where I am.

5954
03:33:58,620 --> 03:33:59,440
Yes, I do.

5955
03:33:59,780 --> 03:34:00,680
No, you don't.

5956
03:34:00,740 --> 03:34:04,700
I don't need to.

5957
03:34:06,180 --> 03:34:08,040
You don't even know where I am.

5958
03:34:08,940 --> 03:34:10,340
Alright, what's your why?

5959
03:34:11,420 --> 03:34:12,620
I'm not telling you anything.

5960
03:34:12,620 --> 03:34:14,860
I can't do anything with a why.

5961
03:34:15,000 --> 03:34:16,620
I can't do anything with a why.

5962
03:34:17,000 --> 03:34:17,920
You have...

5963
03:34:17,920 --> 03:34:21,280
You have sneaky people who are telling me...

5964
03:34:21,280 --> 03:34:22,980
Telling you where I'm at.

5965
03:34:23,460 --> 03:34:25,860
I need you to tell me where your why is.

5966
03:34:25,860 --> 03:34:27,100
I just need to know your why.

5967
03:34:27,220 --> 03:34:28,160
The why is different.

5968
03:34:28,400 --> 03:34:30,860
The why is what level you are at.

5969
03:34:31,680 --> 03:34:32,860
I'm at 90.

5970
03:34:34,020 --> 03:34:34,500
Alright.

5971
03:34:38,220 --> 03:34:39,700
Gosh, I thought I was about to fall.

5972
03:34:45,240 --> 03:34:47,640
What trap have you set up for me?

5973
03:34:47,680 --> 03:34:48,920
I have no trap!

5974
03:34:49,380 --> 03:34:50,520
I actually...

5975
03:34:50,520 --> 03:34:54,040
I don't need to do any trap with what you're doing right now.

5976
03:34:54,040 --> 03:34:56,060
Someone came and snitched!

5977
03:34:56,240 --> 03:34:56,580
I

5978
03:35:02,850 --> 03:35:05,690
don't believe your lies.

5979
03:35:07,450 --> 03:35:10,430
I don't need to do any tricks.

5980
03:35:11,330 --> 03:35:12,390
Yes, you do.

5981
03:35:12,630 --> 03:35:13,230
No, I don't.

5982
03:35:13,450 --> 03:35:14,510
You wanna know why?

5983
03:35:14,930 --> 03:35:16,990
What I was doing?

5984
03:35:17,690 --> 03:35:21,290
I thought, well, it'd be funny if I placed more blocks above.

5985
03:35:21,610 --> 03:35:22,250
But like...

5986
03:35:22,250 --> 03:35:23,970
And then you told me you were at 30.

5987
03:35:24,230 --> 03:35:26,510
And do you know how high this fucking mountain is?

5988
03:35:27,410 --> 03:35:28,970
It's a lot more than 30.

5989
03:35:28,970 --> 03:35:30,810
It's like 130.

5990
03:35:31,250 --> 03:35:33,370
And I didn't even say I was at 30.

5991
03:35:33,650 --> 03:35:34,570
Yes, you did.

5992
03:35:34,670 --> 03:35:37,750
And that's when I knew I didn't even have to do anything.

5993
03:35:39,570 --> 03:35:42,490
I'm gonna come out and you won't know where I am.

5994
03:35:43,210 --> 03:35:44,830
Oh, I know where you are.

5995
03:35:45,190 --> 03:35:46,450
How do you know where I am?

5996
03:35:46,450 --> 03:35:47,610
I know what you are.

5997
03:35:48,070 --> 03:35:51,410
This entire mountain fucking covers a lot of blocks.

5998
03:35:52,390 --> 03:35:55,330
Yeah, but you don't know exactly where I'm gonna come out on the mountain.

5999
03:35:55,830 --> 03:35:56,810
Yes, I do.

6000
03:35:57,610 --> 03:35:59,110
Do you see my name?

6001
03:35:59,170 --> 03:35:59,850
I don't see you.

6002
03:36:00,930 --> 03:36:02,510
I don't even see your name.

6003
03:36:02,590 --> 03:36:05,590
Because you still have to dig!

6004
03:36:07,310 --> 03:36:08,230
I'm digging!

6005
03:36:10,550 --> 03:36:13,810
You still have a long way to go.

6006
03:36:14,270 --> 03:36:15,690
Guys, how much do I have to go?

6007
03:36:17,210 --> 03:36:18,050
What's the top?

6008
03:36:18,130 --> 03:36:18,710
Where are you at?

6009
03:36:20,070 --> 03:36:21,150
Where are you at?

6010
03:36:22,530 --> 03:36:24,750
You're the one who's just like...

6011
03:36:24,750 --> 03:36:27,290
I'm so tired of digging.

6012
03:36:28,490 --> 03:36:31,650
Please, why won't you just dig out?

6013
03:36:32,850 --> 03:36:34,530
Oh, and now look at you.

6014
03:36:35,330 --> 03:36:36,190
Look at you.

6015
03:36:37,350 --> 03:36:38,970
Oh, you're not even that high.

6016
03:36:39,110 --> 03:36:40,190
Oh my gosh.

6017
03:36:40,630 --> 03:36:41,990
You're so dramatic.

6018
03:36:43,450 --> 03:36:45,630
140 is not that...

6019
03:36:45,630 --> 03:36:47,170
I got out at 66.

6020
03:36:47,910 --> 03:36:53,570
I had to climb up this mountain to get to where you are.

6021
03:36:56,050 --> 03:36:56,530
Um...

6022
03:36:56,530 --> 03:36:58,030
Okay, we have an actual problem.

6023
03:36:58,550 --> 03:36:59,570
What's the problem?

6024
03:37:00,610 --> 03:37:01,090
Sleep.

6025
03:37:03,910 --> 03:37:04,390
So...

6026
03:37:04,390 --> 03:37:08,690
My pickaxe just broke and I don't have a crafting table.

6027
03:37:11,950 --> 03:37:13,170
Do you have a bed?

6028
03:37:15,210 --> 03:37:16,370
Yeah, I have a bed.

6029
03:37:16,610 --> 03:37:17,870
Okay, put that bed down.

6030
03:37:17,970 --> 03:37:19,050
We have to sleep in.

6031
03:37:19,570 --> 03:37:21,430
Oh, I can only sleep at night.

6032
03:37:22,130 --> 03:37:23,770
Yeah, it's sun is setting.

6033
03:37:24,090 --> 03:37:24,970
Sun is setting.

6034
03:37:25,250 --> 03:37:26,130
It won't let me sleep.

6035
03:37:26,250 --> 03:37:27,370
Not yet, it's setting.

6036
03:37:33,830 --> 03:37:36,670
It's not that high, she says.

6037
03:37:36,730 --> 03:37:37,550
By the way, I'm sleeping.

6038
03:37:38,230 --> 03:37:39,030
I did too.

6039
03:37:40,230 --> 03:37:41,070
Yeah, so...

6040
03:37:41,070 --> 03:37:41,950
I guess I'm stuck here.

6041
03:37:42,090 --> 03:37:43,350
Oh my God, give me your coordinates.

6042
03:37:45,930 --> 03:37:47,210
Oh, we're stuck here?

6043
03:37:47,310 --> 03:37:48,070
That's fine.

6044
03:37:48,070 --> 03:37:49,930
Hold on.

6045
03:37:53,690 --> 03:37:55,550
Saving private minutes.

6046
03:37:57,610 --> 03:37:59,010
Wait, hold on.

6047
03:38:00,610 --> 03:38:02,270
I'm pretty close.

6048
03:38:02,470 --> 03:38:03,770
I could punch my way to freedom.

6049
03:38:03,990 --> 03:38:05,610
Okay, do it.

6050
03:38:09,830 --> 03:38:11,950
There we go, guys.

6051
03:38:15,730 --> 03:38:17,950
I don't have a crafting table.

6052
03:38:17,950 --> 03:38:19,550
Oh my God.

6053
03:38:22,850 --> 03:38:24,550
Oh, I could've just put that in there.

6054
03:38:24,690 --> 03:38:25,130
Oh my gosh.

6055
03:38:25,310 --> 03:38:25,690
TNT?

6056
03:38:26,050 --> 03:38:27,750
Okay, I'm gonna do the TNT method.

6057
03:38:30,750 --> 03:38:31,370
Uh-oh.

6058
03:38:31,930 --> 03:38:32,590
Spooky sound.

6059
03:38:33,930 --> 03:38:35,790
Wait, how do I...

6060
03:38:35,790 --> 03:38:36,710
Oh, I have the flint.

6061
03:38:36,850 --> 03:38:38,350
I have the flint that will make it...

6062
03:38:38,350 --> 03:38:41,590
I swear to God, if you blow up...

6063
03:38:41,590 --> 03:38:44,410
and get knocked back into your fucking hole...

6064
03:38:44,410 --> 03:38:45,910
I might die.

6065
03:38:45,910 --> 03:38:47,130
Probably not.

6066
03:38:47,730 --> 03:38:49,610
Alright, 07s, get ready, guys.

6067
03:38:49,750 --> 03:38:50,230
07.

6068
03:38:52,350 --> 03:38:54,090
This might end up being her fucking...

6069
03:38:54,890 --> 03:38:56,390
gravestone at this rate.

6070
03:38:56,870 --> 03:38:57,090
Oh,

6071
03:39:00,160 --> 03:39:00,640
this sucks.

6072
03:39:04,760 --> 03:39:06,760
Do you need me to save you?

6073
03:39:07,000 --> 03:39:08,540
Do you need me to save you?

6074
03:39:08,740 --> 03:39:09,980
I have to punch into the wall.

6075
03:39:12,480 --> 03:39:14,640
Do you need me to dig down?

6076
03:39:16,220 --> 03:39:16,820
Um...

6077
03:39:16,820 --> 03:39:17,700
Yeah.

6078
03:39:18,200 --> 03:39:19,300
Alright, what are the coordinates?

6079
03:39:22,080 --> 03:39:23,280
Negative 3587.

6080
03:39:25,220 --> 03:39:26,640
And then 1693.

6081
03:39:30,300 --> 03:39:32,760
Oh my God, why did you...

6082
03:39:32,760 --> 03:39:33,860
Oh my God.

6083
03:39:36,660 --> 03:39:37,260
1693.

6084
03:39:39,500 --> 03:39:40,840
Yeah, I went a little far.

6085
03:39:40,840 --> 03:39:42,680
Okay, okay, and then negative 35...

6086
03:39:43,520 --> 03:39:45,080
Oh my God, okay.

6087
03:39:45,280 --> 03:39:47,140
It's just a couple blocks.

6088
03:39:47,440 --> 03:39:48,440
Okay, what's your why?

6089
03:39:49,480 --> 03:39:51,180
I see you, I literally see your name.

6090
03:39:51,300 --> 03:39:52,320
Oh my God.

6091
03:39:53,020 --> 03:39:54,080
What's your why?

6092
03:39:54,520 --> 03:39:55,380
What's your why?

6093
03:39:56,280 --> 03:39:58,220
Just look down, you'll see me.

6094
03:39:59,840 --> 03:40:01,420
I can hear you digging.

6095
03:40:01,680 --> 03:40:03,900
I just need to know how much I need to...

6096
03:40:03,900 --> 03:40:05,860
You can literally punch his dirt!

6097
03:40:06,240 --> 03:40:07,840
Oh my God, it's...

6098
03:40:07,840 --> 03:40:09,560
It's stone where I am!

6099
03:40:09,560 --> 03:40:10,720
Oh my God.

6100
03:40:11,220 --> 03:40:13,380
It's literally stone here!

6101
03:40:17,770 --> 03:40:18,870
Oh my God.

6102
03:40:21,630 --> 03:40:23,270
Dig up, dig up once.

6103
03:40:23,810 --> 03:40:25,570
Wait, can you come get me?

6104
03:40:27,070 --> 03:40:27,950
Can you come get me?

6105
03:40:28,450 --> 03:40:30,110
I made a deep hole, dig up once.

6106
03:40:30,210 --> 03:40:31,690
No, I'm stuck.

6107
03:40:31,910 --> 03:40:32,990
How are you stuck?

6108
03:40:33,030 --> 03:40:33,950
Just use your hands!

6109
03:40:34,190 --> 03:40:36,270
Use your hands and climb up.

6110
03:40:36,350 --> 03:40:37,190
I digged a hole.

6111
03:40:37,870 --> 03:40:38,670
I can't hold on.

6112
03:40:40,630 --> 03:40:41,170
Oh my God.

6113
03:40:41,170 --> 03:40:42,830
Wait, did you place it again?

6114
03:40:43,370 --> 03:40:43,950
What the heck?

6115
03:40:43,970 --> 03:40:46,550
I was gonna explode it so that I could get through.

6116
03:40:46,850 --> 03:40:47,990
Oh my God.

6117
03:40:49,410 --> 03:40:50,810
Oh my God.

6118
03:40:51,130 --> 03:40:52,390
Hold on, I'm coming through.

6119
03:40:52,510 --> 03:40:53,070
Hold on.

6120
03:40:54,090 --> 03:40:57,270
Oh, I see you, hi!

6121
03:40:59,030 --> 03:41:00,950
Oh my God.

6122
03:41:02,350 --> 03:41:03,850
Dig up, dig up.

6123
03:41:04,550 --> 03:41:05,530
Hold on, I'm going up.

6124
03:41:06,450 --> 03:41:07,490
Oh wait, hold on.

6125
03:41:07,730 --> 03:41:09,070
I guess I'll leave him.

6126
03:41:09,590 --> 03:41:11,150
Wait, where is it?

6127
03:41:11,530 --> 03:41:12,350
Is it night time?

6128
03:41:12,690 --> 03:41:12,910
No.

6129
03:41:14,950 --> 03:41:16,330
I'm going, I'm going.

6130
03:41:17,450 --> 03:41:18,970
This hole sucks.

6131
03:41:19,570 --> 03:41:20,730
Oh, I'm sorry.

6132
03:41:20,930 --> 03:41:22,530
Do you want me to make a better hole?

6133
03:41:25,590 --> 03:41:26,710
I'm sorry.

6134
03:41:27,150 --> 03:41:30,510
My rescue mission is not good enough for you.

6135
03:41:30,510 --> 03:41:32,390
Oh my God.

6136
03:41:32,790 --> 03:41:35,350
You wanna see how high this fucking mountain is?

6137
03:41:35,750 --> 03:41:36,750
Look down here.

6138
03:41:37,490 --> 03:41:38,710
Look down here.

6139
03:41:42,470 --> 03:41:43,330
Hey, you know what?

6140
03:41:43,390 --> 03:41:44,950
It's good that we dug a lot.

6141
03:41:45,170 --> 03:41:51,650
What if we found the place that we have to put the enderpearls in?

6142
03:41:53,410 --> 03:41:53,930
Alright.

6143
03:41:55,230 --> 03:41:57,310
Now we gotta get to the nether.

6144
03:41:57,870 --> 03:41:58,890
I have lots of gold.

6145
03:41:58,910 --> 03:42:00,230
Yeah, now we gotta get to the nether.

6146
03:42:00,230 --> 03:42:02,190
I have lots of gold too.

6147
03:42:04,210 --> 03:42:04,650
Alright.

6148
03:42:05,710 --> 03:42:06,390
Oh wait, hold on.

6149
03:42:06,450 --> 03:42:07,390
I'm gonna burn my stuff.

6150
03:42:07,830 --> 03:42:09,270
Do you have any obsidian?

6151
03:42:09,490 --> 03:42:10,170
I have three on me.

6152
03:42:11,110 --> 03:42:12,090
No, I don't have any.

6153
03:42:13,050 --> 03:42:16,070
Actually, I really need to punch trees.

6154
03:42:16,250 --> 03:42:18,050
I'm gonna go punch this tree over here.

6155
03:42:18,290 --> 03:42:19,590
I'm gonna get my furnace too.

6156
03:42:19,830 --> 03:42:21,750
I'm gonna make some gold as well.

6157
03:42:22,150 --> 03:42:23,710
I'm gonna punch this tree over here.

6158
03:42:25,950 --> 03:42:28,010
The single tree on this mountain.

6159
03:42:28,010 --> 03:42:31,850
I feel like we should make like a mini house.

6160
03:42:32,470 --> 03:42:33,690
Just to put our stuff.

6161
03:42:33,990 --> 03:42:38,490
When we find lava, we should make a mini house.

6162
03:42:41,390 --> 03:42:43,110
Make more than one furnace.

6163
03:42:44,270 --> 03:42:45,130
Wait, no.

6164
03:42:46,030 --> 03:42:47,670
Why do I have cobble?

6165
03:42:51,430 --> 03:42:53,630
Oh wait, I'm so stupid.

6166
03:42:55,030 --> 03:42:56,750
Wait, what happened to my crafting table?

6167
03:42:56,750 --> 03:42:59,030
Oh, I fucking broke it.

6168
03:42:59,110 --> 03:43:00,430
I never picked it up.

6169
03:43:00,890 --> 03:43:02,290
I'm about to make one.

6170
03:43:02,550 --> 03:43:04,770
I just want to make another furnace.

6171
03:43:05,810 --> 03:43:06,610
Oh, why?

6172
03:43:07,350 --> 03:43:10,810
Because I have a lot of stuff to burn.

6173
03:43:11,810 --> 03:43:12,790
Oh, me too.

6174
03:43:12,930 --> 03:43:14,590
I want to get rid of all of it now.

6175
03:43:18,310 --> 03:43:19,630
Alright, let's see.

6176
03:43:21,630 --> 03:43:24,510
I'm gonna throw away my iron stuff.

6177
03:43:25,150 --> 03:43:27,610
No, we need the iron stuff.

6178
03:43:27,710 --> 03:43:28,750
Yeah, you can throw away your stuff.

6179
03:43:28,890 --> 03:43:30,430
Yeah, I don't need my iron sword.

6180
03:43:31,210 --> 03:43:33,170
We need the actual iron though.

6181
03:43:34,310 --> 03:43:34,830
Why?

6182
03:43:35,530 --> 03:43:36,330
For shields.

6183
03:43:36,650 --> 03:43:37,590
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

6184
03:43:37,590 --> 03:43:38,250
And water buckets.

6185
03:43:39,350 --> 03:43:40,950
I'm planning on doing that.

6186
03:43:43,690 --> 03:43:45,590
Wow, the daylight.

6187
03:43:47,170 --> 03:43:48,290
Smells good out here.

6188
03:43:48,550 --> 03:43:51,190
Wow, I forgot what that looked like for a sec.

6189
03:43:52,430 --> 03:43:54,590
Someone just said a spawn point.

6190
03:43:54,690 --> 03:43:55,230
That's so funny.

6191
03:43:55,350 --> 03:43:56,070
That's so funny.

6192
03:43:56,150 --> 03:43:57,790
I think they forgot what hardcore meant.

6193
03:44:03,830 --> 03:44:05,790
We're never coming back here.

6194
03:44:10,550 --> 03:44:14,150
Oh, I can make a lapis blocker.

6195
03:44:14,210 --> 03:44:14,890
Right, guys?

6196
03:44:15,670 --> 03:44:16,970
Wait, I actually...

6197
03:44:16,970 --> 03:44:18,610
I have enough for a lapis blocker.

6198
03:44:18,610 --> 03:44:22,710
I have two stacks though, so it's not like...

6199
03:44:22,710 --> 03:44:23,510
Of lapis?

6200
03:44:23,550 --> 03:44:24,590
I have three stacks.

6201
03:44:24,730 --> 03:44:25,410
I have tons of lapis.

6202
03:44:25,410 --> 03:44:26,950
How much is a block?

6203
03:44:30,430 --> 03:44:31,170
Lapis block.

6204
03:44:31,230 --> 03:44:32,330
It still takes two.

6205
03:44:32,470 --> 03:44:34,850
I don't need these two lapis.

6206
03:44:35,370 --> 03:44:36,730
Here, give me the lapis.

6207
03:44:37,110 --> 03:44:38,350
Here, have the two.

6208
03:44:41,230 --> 03:44:42,870
Oh, wait, I still don't have enough either.

6209
03:44:43,410 --> 03:44:44,370
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

6210
03:44:44,610 --> 03:44:45,470
Oh, it's no point.

6211
03:44:48,910 --> 03:44:49,950
Are you okay?

6212
03:44:50,150 --> 03:44:50,430
No.

6213
03:44:54,450 --> 03:44:56,070
What else is around here?

6214
03:44:56,930 --> 03:44:58,170
I'm not okay.

6215
03:44:58,810 --> 03:45:00,690
Did you find any villages while...

6216
03:45:00,690 --> 03:45:02,810
No, I just waited on the mountain.

6217
03:45:04,550 --> 03:45:07,130
No, I didn't see any villages while I was waiting for you.

6218
03:45:07,530 --> 03:45:08,770
Oh, this isn't a house.

6219
03:45:08,870 --> 03:45:10,490
This is you trying to...

6220
03:45:10,490 --> 03:45:11,650
Trap me in the mountain.

6221
03:45:12,870 --> 03:45:14,190
Yeah, and then I gave up.

6222
03:45:14,210 --> 03:45:15,930
Because I realized how high up you were.

6223
03:45:18,770 --> 03:45:20,170
I was like, there's no point.

6224
03:45:20,270 --> 03:45:23,610
There's no point doing this.

6225
03:45:24,650 --> 03:45:26,350
There's a point to everything.

6226
03:45:26,770 --> 03:45:27,610
No, there's not.

6227
03:45:29,390 --> 03:45:29,790
Minecraft.

6228
03:45:30,230 --> 03:45:32,090
Oh my gosh, I almost fell in lava.

6229
03:45:32,890 --> 03:45:34,050
Oh, wait, we need that.

6230
03:45:34,170 --> 03:45:35,330
Okay, I'm gonna make a bucket then.

6231
03:45:36,190 --> 03:45:36,930
Oh, yeah, yeah.

6232
03:45:37,250 --> 03:45:38,250
There's some lava here.

6233
03:45:40,050 --> 03:45:41,890
Wait, actually, no, we don't need...

6234
03:45:41,890 --> 03:45:44,030
I mean, we can do it in the...

6235
03:45:44,510 --> 03:45:45,190
In the ocean.

6236
03:45:45,190 --> 03:45:46,030
In the ocean.

6237
03:45:47,290 --> 03:45:48,310
Actually, no.

6238
03:45:48,530 --> 03:45:50,350
Actually, I'll grab water.

6239
03:45:50,550 --> 03:45:51,730
Wouldn't it be easier to just get water?

6240
03:45:52,390 --> 03:45:54,570
So you have to make it...

6241
03:45:54,570 --> 03:45:55,810
It's like...

6242
03:45:55,810 --> 03:45:59,390
You have to make it a certain way so that it actually turns into obsidian...

6243
03:45:59,390 --> 03:46:01,610
And not into cobblestone.

6244
03:46:01,710 --> 03:46:03,190
Well, if it's like lava itself...

6245
03:46:04,730 --> 03:46:05,470
Where are you?

6246
03:46:05,590 --> 03:46:06,350
Are you gonna make the lava?

6247
03:46:06,350 --> 03:46:07,590
We need a lava pool.

6248
03:46:08,510 --> 03:46:11,610
So like, I need to get water and then...

6249
03:46:11,610 --> 03:46:13,150
I need two buckets of water, right?

6250
03:46:13,150 --> 03:46:13,550
Regardless.

6251
03:46:14,290 --> 03:46:15,450
We need to make like...

6252
03:46:15,450 --> 03:46:17,430
No, we can use the lava pool to do it.

6253
03:46:18,930 --> 03:46:20,170
So I just need the water.

6254
03:46:20,890 --> 03:46:23,030
Yeah, but we need lava for protection in the nether.

6255
03:46:24,210 --> 03:46:24,530
What?

6256
03:46:25,650 --> 03:46:27,910
Why don't we just mine the obsidian?

6257
03:46:29,450 --> 03:46:29,810
What?

6258
03:46:29,930 --> 03:46:32,230
I mean, if we get the pool, then we can mine the obsidian.

6259
03:46:32,450 --> 03:46:34,610
No, it'd be easier to just...

6260
03:46:34,610 --> 03:46:35,510
Make it...

6261
03:46:35,510 --> 03:46:38,430
We just pour water to get the bottom first.

6262
03:46:39,170 --> 03:46:41,260
And then mine and create the...

6263
03:46:45,150 --> 03:46:45,990
Okay, okay.

6264
03:46:46,110 --> 03:46:47,330
Let me grab water first.

6265
03:46:47,890 --> 03:46:48,470
And then...

6266
03:46:48,470 --> 03:46:50,370
I'll just pour water in it.

6267
03:46:50,790 --> 03:46:54,030
And then mine it and then we just build off the three blocks.

6268
03:46:54,510 --> 03:46:55,610
To make the thing.

6269
03:46:57,570 --> 03:46:59,670
Okay, you'll understand when I do it.

6270
03:47:02,730 --> 03:47:04,230
We need water first.

6271
03:47:06,670 --> 03:47:08,770
That's kinda hard to get on top of the mountain.

6272
03:47:09,930 --> 03:47:10,950
Yeah, but the lava pool is...

6273
03:47:10,950 --> 03:47:12,030
I can just climb back up.

6274
03:47:15,470 --> 03:47:16,490
What else do I need?

6275
03:47:16,790 --> 03:47:17,870
Oh, let me just get the...

6276
03:47:17,870 --> 03:47:19,710
Burn the rabbit meat now.

6277
03:47:21,950 --> 03:47:22,870
You know that if...

6278
03:47:22,870 --> 03:47:23,990
Okay, so...

6279
03:47:23,990 --> 03:47:26,550
You know how to make it stop being...

6280
03:47:26,550 --> 03:47:27,250
Blowing lava?

6281
03:47:27,630 --> 03:47:30,270
The lava block itself.

6282
03:47:30,430 --> 03:47:32,750
If the lava is like the main...

6283
03:47:32,750 --> 03:47:34,670
The main source, then it should be fine.

6284
03:47:35,670 --> 03:47:37,190
Why don't we just find a lava pool?

6285
03:47:37,290 --> 03:47:38,390
And then mine from it then.

6286
03:47:38,890 --> 03:47:39,970
Isn't that the lava pool?

6287
03:47:40,150 --> 03:47:41,690
Didn't you say there's a lava pool back there?

6288
03:47:41,690 --> 03:47:44,310
No, it was a little tiny thing of lava.

6289
03:47:44,610 --> 03:47:44,850
That's it.

6290
03:47:45,310 --> 03:47:46,470
Okay, nevermind.

6291
03:47:46,630 --> 03:47:48,510
Oh my gosh, you made it seem like...

6292
03:47:48,510 --> 03:47:50,310
I thought you meant...

6293
03:47:50,310 --> 03:47:52,510
No, this is...

6294
03:47:53,070 --> 03:47:55,390
Miscommunication from somebody.

6295
03:47:57,250 --> 03:47:58,990
I wonder who...

6296
03:48:00,170 --> 03:48:02,170
Fucking gave me the wrong information.

6297
03:48:04,910 --> 03:48:06,150
Who could it be?

6298
03:48:06,150 --> 03:48:06,210
Who could it be?

6299
03:48:09,510 --> 03:48:11,330
I mean, we could go back into the mines.

6300
03:48:11,750 --> 03:48:12,470
No, we're not going...

6301
03:48:14,230 --> 03:48:16,550
We're not going back into the mines.

6302
03:48:16,690 --> 03:48:17,850
Okay, we gotta sleep.

6303
03:48:18,250 --> 03:48:19,850
That's my bed!

6304
03:48:20,210 --> 03:48:20,850
No, it's not!

6305
03:48:21,230 --> 03:48:22,690
I don't have a bed now!

6306
03:48:23,450 --> 03:48:24,410
Get out of my bed!

6307
03:48:27,610 --> 03:48:28,530
There we go.

6308
03:48:30,890 --> 03:48:32,210
Why do you have a blue bed?

6309
03:48:32,870 --> 03:48:34,350
Because I wanted a blue bed.

6310
03:48:36,390 --> 03:48:39,230
Well, I called dibs on this color for...

6311
03:48:40,000 --> 03:48:41,990
I saw you take it!

6312
03:48:42,490 --> 03:48:46,790
I literally saw you take it!

6313
03:48:46,790 --> 03:48:49,530
I literally saw you take it!

6314
03:48:52,070 --> 03:48:54,550
This is why we can't have nice things.

6315
03:48:54,710 --> 03:48:58,590
This is exactly why we can't have nice things.

6316
03:48:58,610 --> 03:49:00,330
Okay, we're gonna go find...

6317
03:49:00,330 --> 03:49:02,850
We're gonna go find a lava pit.

6318
03:49:03,950 --> 03:49:04,430
Alright.

6319
03:49:04,750 --> 03:49:06,150
There's tons of them in this forest.

6320
03:49:06,330 --> 03:49:07,610
There should be, yeah.

6321
03:49:08,110 --> 03:49:08,590
Alright.

6322
03:49:09,890 --> 03:49:10,490
Oh, look!

6323
03:49:10,750 --> 03:49:12,030
That looks like lava down there.

6324
03:49:12,590 --> 03:49:12,890
Where?

6325
03:49:13,570 --> 03:49:15,130
In that big, big cave.

6326
03:49:15,790 --> 03:49:19,210
I'm not gonna go to the caves and make the fucking nether stuff.

6327
03:49:20,570 --> 03:49:21,150
Why not?

6328
03:49:21,930 --> 03:49:23,710
My god, do you wanna die?

6329
03:49:24,310 --> 03:49:27,450
What do you mean, why not?

6330
03:49:29,170 --> 03:49:30,350
Oh, don't go down.

6331
03:49:30,410 --> 03:49:31,530
That's how you die!

6332
03:49:35,820 --> 03:49:37,520
Oh my god, you're...

6333
03:49:37,520 --> 03:49:38,320
Just fall down.

6334
03:49:38,740 --> 03:49:40,860
We literally have diamond armor, just fall.

6335
03:49:41,100 --> 03:49:42,520
I don't wanna take any damage.

6336
03:49:42,720 --> 03:49:44,680
I don't wanna damage my armor at all.

6337
03:49:44,880 --> 03:49:47,060
Just fall down, we can repair it.

6338
03:49:47,100 --> 03:49:49,660
We have so much diamonds to repair it.

6339
03:49:50,540 --> 03:49:52,640
No, I'm not wasting my diamonds to repair it.

6340
03:49:52,660 --> 03:49:53,420
We gotta get mending.

6341
03:49:54,100 --> 03:49:54,380
Maybe.

6342
03:49:54,800 --> 03:49:56,800
We're not gonna have time to get mending!

6343
03:49:56,800 --> 03:49:58,060
Why not?

6344
03:49:58,700 --> 03:50:00,060
Oh my god, we're gonna have

6345
03:50:06,230 --> 03:50:06,430
to...

6346
03:50:06,750 --> 03:50:07,770
Okay, alright.

6347
03:50:08,350 --> 03:50:09,370
Alright, I'm calm.

6348
03:50:09,410 --> 03:50:11,890
We gotta get at least the projectile stuff.

6349
03:50:12,710 --> 03:50:15,290
And we gotta also get...

6350
03:50:15,290 --> 03:50:16,850
Slow falling potions.

6351
03:50:17,270 --> 03:50:18,450
And we gotta get here...

6352
03:50:18,450 --> 03:50:19,730
Oh, I left my bow.

6353
03:50:19,970 --> 03:50:22,450
Oh my god, there's trees everywhere.

6354
03:50:23,430 --> 03:50:24,730
There's trees everywhere.

6355
03:50:25,370 --> 03:50:27,190
There weren't trees in the caves.

6356
03:50:28,230 --> 03:50:30,130
There's trees everywhere right now.

6357
03:50:30,130 --> 03:50:31,850
I'm literally farming trees now.

6358
03:50:31,990 --> 03:50:33,810
I'm still in the caves, mentally.

6359
03:50:34,450 --> 03:50:36,430
Oh no, the cave madness.

6360
03:50:36,970 --> 03:50:38,230
She's just standing there.

6361
03:50:38,290 --> 03:50:40,530
Why is she just standing there?

6362
03:50:41,310 --> 03:50:42,690
I'm mentally in the caves.

6363
03:50:42,790 --> 03:50:44,190
I was switching my items.

6364
03:50:44,310 --> 03:50:44,790
My god!

6365
03:50:45,870 --> 03:50:47,570
Oh, there's pillagers here.

6366
03:50:48,330 --> 03:50:48,590
What?

6367
03:50:48,850 --> 03:50:49,470
Where?

6368
03:50:49,850 --> 03:50:50,890
Right behind me.

6369
03:50:51,610 --> 03:50:52,330
Where are you?

6370
03:50:53,990 --> 03:50:55,230
I'm literally...

6371
03:50:56,020 --> 03:50:57,050
Wait, where are you?

6372
03:50:57,050 --> 03:50:59,250
See, this is why we can't make a good team.

6373
03:50:59,350 --> 03:51:00,130
There you go.

6374
03:51:01,490 --> 03:51:03,190
Watch out, he's right behind you.

6375
03:51:03,410 --> 03:51:05,090
Just come at me here.

6376
03:51:05,410 --> 03:51:07,010
Just run, it doesn't matter.

6377
03:51:07,930 --> 03:51:08,910
He doesn't matter.

6378
03:51:09,150 --> 03:51:10,250
He literally does not matter.

6379
03:51:10,710 --> 03:51:11,230
Don't kill him.

6380
03:51:12,410 --> 03:51:13,850
Run away, don't kill him.

6381
03:51:13,890 --> 03:51:15,710
I know, he'll start the raid.

6382
03:51:16,370 --> 03:51:18,930
Yeah, we have to not have a raid happen.

6383
03:51:19,070 --> 03:51:20,050
Okay, wait, give me a second.

6384
03:51:20,250 --> 03:51:22,250
I need to put my shield on.

6385
03:51:24,070 --> 03:51:25,650
Where did my diamond sword go?

6386
03:51:25,650 --> 03:51:25,950
He's coming for me!

6387
03:51:26,390 --> 03:51:27,850
Oh my god, they're coming for me!

6388
03:51:28,010 --> 03:51:30,610
Wait, where did my...

6389
03:51:30,610 --> 03:51:33,010
Where did my diamond sword go?

6390
03:51:34,370 --> 03:51:35,370
Oh, I never...

6391
03:51:36,230 --> 03:51:37,250
Did you not make one?

6392
03:51:37,970 --> 03:51:38,870
No, I did.

6393
03:51:39,330 --> 03:51:40,570
Oh my god, they're still coming for me.

6394
03:51:43,250 --> 03:51:43,690
Wait...

6395
03:51:44,450 --> 03:51:45,910
Did I throw it away?

6396
03:51:46,490 --> 03:51:47,470
Did you throw it away?

6397
03:51:48,350 --> 03:51:49,510
I think I...

6398
03:51:49,510 --> 03:51:51,710
Oh, I never made one because I made my pickaxe.

6399
03:51:53,030 --> 03:51:54,030
I'm just gonna kill him.

6400
03:51:54,030 --> 03:51:54,950
I'll drink milk.

6401
03:51:55,410 --> 03:51:56,470
I'll drink milk.

6402
03:51:57,430 --> 03:51:58,650
He dropped something.

6403
03:51:58,790 --> 03:52:00,130
Wait, what was the potion he dropped?

6404
03:52:02,070 --> 03:52:04,010
Bad omen 3, you can drink that.

6405
03:52:06,090 --> 03:52:08,010
You have more experience with that.

6406
03:52:09,630 --> 03:52:11,210
Wait, you have a bad omen now?

6407
03:52:11,330 --> 03:52:12,570
No, I gave it to you.

6408
03:52:13,950 --> 03:52:15,070
Wait, you drink it?

6409
03:52:15,150 --> 03:52:16,690
Oh, it's not like automatic now?

6410
03:52:16,790 --> 03:52:17,150
Interesting.

6411
03:52:18,590 --> 03:52:20,490
You don't get bad omen from killing anymore.

6412
03:52:20,730 --> 03:52:20,930
What?

6413
03:52:20,930 --> 03:52:21,650
What?

6414
03:52:21,690 --> 03:52:22,730
That's crazy.

6415
03:52:23,050 --> 03:52:24,550
Yeah, yeah, you dropped it as a potion.

6416
03:52:25,270 --> 03:52:26,770
You're the one that killed it.

6417
03:52:27,090 --> 03:52:28,270
No, I saw that.

6418
03:52:28,370 --> 03:52:31,030
No, but you picked up the potion, that's why I asked you what did he drop.

6419
03:52:32,870 --> 03:52:34,370
What the heck?

6420
03:52:34,450 --> 03:52:35,330
Oh, interesting.

6421
03:52:36,790 --> 03:52:37,810
Wait, what was your plan again?

6422
03:52:37,970 --> 03:52:39,270
Oh yeah, to find lava pool.

6423
03:52:40,070 --> 03:52:40,470
Yeah.

6424
03:52:40,990 --> 03:52:42,430
Where's your fucking cocoa beans?

6425
03:52:44,350 --> 03:52:46,730
We'll go this way, I feel like...

6426
03:52:46,730 --> 03:52:48,410
Wait, where are you?

6427
03:52:48,410 --> 03:52:49,430
I'm in the water.

6428
03:52:49,570 --> 03:52:50,410
Wait, where did you go?

6429
03:52:50,530 --> 03:52:51,270
Did you go in the jungle?

6430
03:52:52,550 --> 03:52:53,870
I'm not in the jungle!

6431
03:52:54,650 --> 03:52:55,590
Oh, there I see you.

6432
03:52:55,670 --> 03:52:56,810
I was gonna go that way too.

6433
03:52:57,670 --> 03:52:58,790
That's why I was like, wait a second.

6434
03:52:59,590 --> 03:53:02,290
Apparently, it's for use in the tricky trial dungeon.

6435
03:53:02,710 --> 03:53:03,830
Whatever that means.

6436
03:53:04,650 --> 03:53:06,170
That's the trial dungeon, right?

6437
03:53:06,270 --> 03:53:07,230
The thing I talked about before?

6438
03:53:08,270 --> 03:53:09,210
Oh, it's that?

6439
03:53:09,350 --> 03:53:10,090
Wait, what is that?

6440
03:53:10,130 --> 03:53:10,870
I don't know what it is.

6441
03:53:13,690 --> 03:53:15,450
How do we use it in that?

6442
03:53:16,690 --> 03:53:18,150
Yeah, what does that even mean?

6443
03:53:18,490 --> 03:53:20,990
Oh my god, rip everybody's farms.

6444
03:53:21,210 --> 03:53:23,150
I see a village!

6445
03:53:23,790 --> 03:53:25,930
We don't need a village anymore, right?

6446
03:53:26,470 --> 03:53:27,690
Oh wait, nevermind, it's not a village.

6447
03:53:27,810 --> 03:53:28,570
It's a nether portal!

6448
03:53:28,810 --> 03:53:30,450
Oh, we can use that to make it!

6449
03:53:30,590 --> 03:53:32,170
Use that to make the thing.

6450
03:53:32,830 --> 03:53:34,430
Just take away the corrupted areas.

6451
03:53:34,970 --> 03:53:35,670
Yeah, yeah.

6452
03:53:36,090 --> 03:53:37,070
And you have your flint, right?

6453
03:53:38,090 --> 03:53:38,450
Yeah.

6454
03:53:39,530 --> 03:53:40,870
Okay, alright, we can do this.

6455
03:53:41,250 --> 03:53:41,610
Alright.

6456
03:53:41,930 --> 03:53:43,750
Oh wow, it's almost nearly complete too.

6457
03:53:43,890 --> 03:53:44,810
Okay, we can do this.

6458
03:53:44,890 --> 03:53:45,810
Get that corrupted.

6459
03:53:46,030 --> 03:53:47,010
Oh wait, we just need one!

6460
03:53:48,010 --> 03:53:49,750
I have one, I have one, I have one.

6461
03:53:51,070 --> 03:53:51,950
There you go.

6462
03:53:52,450 --> 03:53:54,410
I don't think there's any corrupted areas too.

6463
03:53:55,150 --> 03:53:56,290
Wait, I think it's not corrupted.

6464
03:53:57,510 --> 03:53:58,490
Yeah, I think we're good.

6465
03:53:58,670 --> 03:53:59,810
Okay, lighting up.

6466
03:54:02,930 --> 03:54:03,990
Okay, let's put...

6467
03:54:03,990 --> 03:54:05,250
I'm gonna make another chest.

6468
03:54:06,090 --> 03:54:06,770
I feel like...

6469
03:54:06,770 --> 03:54:09,030
Let's put away stuff we don't want to take to the nether.

6470
03:54:11,930 --> 03:54:15,370
I'm gonna put a crafting table here.

6471
03:54:15,710 --> 03:54:16,150
Chest.

6472
03:54:17,370 --> 03:54:19,330
I'm gonna make another chest for us.

6473
03:54:19,690 --> 03:54:20,570
Get rid of this.

6474
03:54:21,550 --> 03:54:22,890
Um, I don't think...

6475
03:54:22,890 --> 03:54:24,770
Okay, I'm gonna make some...

6476
03:54:25,410 --> 03:54:26,630
Oh, make a gold helmet?

6477
03:54:27,110 --> 03:54:28,270
Yeah, yeah, that's what I'm gonna make.

6478
03:54:28,290 --> 03:54:30,770
But I wanna make some...

6479
03:54:31,550 --> 03:54:32,790
I'm gonna make some bread.

6480
03:54:37,490 --> 03:54:37,850
Um...

6481
03:54:37,850 --> 03:54:38,670
There we go.

6482
03:54:42,610 --> 03:54:43,330
And then...

6483
03:54:43,710 --> 03:54:44,070
Helmet.

6484
03:54:45,170 --> 03:54:47,510
You can just put it in the chest.

6485
03:54:48,050 --> 03:54:48,350
Okay.

6486
03:54:49,170 --> 03:54:50,910
I'll put the stuff I don't need in the chest.

6487
03:54:51,010 --> 03:54:52,110
We don't need all that coal.

6488
03:54:52,930 --> 03:54:54,190
We don't need all this flint.

6489
03:54:54,430 --> 03:54:55,810
We don't need the lapis.

6490
03:54:56,730 --> 03:54:59,230
I don't trust you with my diamonds, so I'm gonna put it in my inventory.

6491
03:55:00,210 --> 03:55:00,570
Hey!

6492
03:55:02,670 --> 03:55:03,490
I mean, what?

6493
03:55:03,930 --> 03:55:05,390
What's gonna happen if we die?

6494
03:55:06,430 --> 03:55:07,150
We're not...

6495
03:55:07,150 --> 03:55:08,110
Don't say that.

6496
03:55:08,450 --> 03:55:09,370
That's what I'm saying, though.

6497
03:55:09,430 --> 03:55:11,390
You were like, oh, I'm just gonna put my diamond in my chest.

6498
03:55:11,530 --> 03:55:11,770
Why?

6499
03:55:11,910 --> 03:55:13,030
Because if we die, we die.

6500
03:55:13,050 --> 03:55:17,130
Because if we come back and then my diamond is gone, then I know why.

6501
03:55:17,750 --> 03:55:20,630
No, but the only reason you put your diamond away is if you die.

6502
03:55:21,490 --> 03:55:26,170
No, the only reason I put my diamond away is because I don't want you to fucking take it from this random chest that isn't locked.

6503
03:55:26,170 --> 03:55:26,790
Yeah, you're...

6504
03:55:26,790 --> 03:55:29,250
Donkey comprehension is not comprehending.

6505
03:55:30,630 --> 03:55:35,410
Alright, are you ready to go into the nether?

6506
03:55:36,810 --> 03:55:37,770
Yeah, I'm ready.

6507
03:55:38,890 --> 03:55:40,110
Get a pickaxe?

6508
03:55:40,310 --> 03:55:40,710
Wait, why?

6509
03:55:40,790 --> 03:55:43,750
I don't have one, actually.

6510
03:55:44,070 --> 03:55:46,170
What happened to your...

6511
03:55:47,110 --> 03:55:48,590
Oh, yeah, because you broke it.

6512
03:55:48,730 --> 03:55:49,830
Yeah, you broke a pickaxe.

6513
03:55:49,890 --> 03:55:50,970
Hey, I was using that.

6514
03:55:56,470 --> 03:55:56,950
Okay.

6515
03:55:57,590 --> 03:56:00,170
Alright, so from here, now we have to...

6516
03:56:02,230 --> 03:56:03,190
We find...

6517
03:56:03,190 --> 03:56:03,710
We survive.

6518
03:56:04,870 --> 03:56:05,870
We have to find a fortress.

6519
03:56:07,250 --> 03:56:09,650
Yeah, we gotta survive and...

6520
03:56:09,650 --> 03:56:10,870
Alright, I have some...

6521
03:56:10,870 --> 03:56:13,590
We gotta feed pigs too for enderpearls.

6522
03:56:13,850 --> 03:56:15,310
How many enderpearls do we need?

6523
03:56:18,250 --> 03:56:20,030
Um, we can...

6524
03:56:20,510 --> 03:56:21,510
Chat, how...

6525
03:56:21,510 --> 03:56:22,830
You know what, I didn't ask you.

6526
03:56:22,830 --> 03:56:24,130
Chat, how many...

6527
03:56:24,670 --> 03:56:27,990
Chat, how many enderpearls do we need, chat?

6528
03:56:28,270 --> 03:56:31,330
We need 12, but how many is it...

6529
03:56:31,330 --> 03:56:32,270
14 safe?

6530
03:56:34,810 --> 03:56:35,730
14, okay.

6531
03:56:35,850 --> 03:56:36,650
At least 12.

6532
03:56:36,910 --> 03:56:37,770
Make a diamond one?

6533
03:56:37,930 --> 03:56:38,090
Okay.

6534
03:56:38,830 --> 03:56:39,730
Diamond pickaxe.

6535
03:56:39,930 --> 03:56:40,650
Oh, wait, hold on.

6536
03:56:43,900 --> 03:56:44,960
Stop pushing me!

6537
03:56:45,060 --> 03:56:45,640
I know that.

6538
03:56:46,220 --> 03:56:47,980
I literally can see you pushing me.

6539
03:56:48,580 --> 03:56:48,840
Stop!

6540
03:56:49,220 --> 03:56:49,360
Ow!

6541
03:56:52,050 --> 03:56:53,110
Alright, are you ready?

6542
03:56:53,110 --> 03:56:53,990
Yeah.

6543
03:56:54,350 --> 03:56:55,510
Here I go.

6544
03:56:55,650 --> 03:56:56,310
I'm going in.

6545
03:56:56,930 --> 03:56:57,390
Alright.

6546
03:56:58,250 --> 03:56:59,610
I'm going in too.

6547
03:57:01,210 --> 03:57:02,330
Please don't be a jungle.

6548
03:57:02,510 --> 03:57:03,230
Please don't be a jungle.

6549
03:57:03,390 --> 03:57:04,690
Please don't be a jungle.

6550
03:57:07,910 --> 03:57:08,370
Okay.

6551
03:57:08,830 --> 03:57:09,950
Could be worse.

6552
03:57:10,310 --> 03:57:11,270
Not that bad.

6553
03:57:11,650 --> 03:57:12,570
This could be worse.

6554
03:57:12,750 --> 03:57:13,570
It's not that bad.

6555
03:57:13,630 --> 03:57:14,850
There's a pig on a chicken?

6556
03:57:15,110 --> 03:57:15,390
Chicken?

6557
03:57:16,030 --> 03:57:19,530
How did a chicken get in here?

6558
03:57:20,930 --> 03:57:22,690
Are you taking the court?

6559
03:57:22,830 --> 03:57:23,970
Yeah, I want the experience.

6560
03:57:23,990 --> 03:57:25,330
Oh, this is...

6561
03:57:25,330 --> 03:57:26,690
Okay, be careful.

6562
03:57:27,170 --> 03:57:27,730
Oh my god.

6563
03:57:28,010 --> 03:57:30,190
How did he get the chicken in here?

6564
03:57:30,530 --> 03:57:33,050
Wait, there's blue fires now?

6565
03:57:34,430 --> 03:57:34,990
Yeah.

6566
03:57:36,110 --> 03:57:37,750
What does blue fire mean?

6567
03:57:38,390 --> 03:57:39,610
That's like a different biome.

6568
03:57:40,550 --> 03:57:41,010
Oh.

6569
03:57:41,090 --> 03:57:43,130
That's the soul fire.

6570
03:57:43,190 --> 03:57:43,450
Oh!

6571
03:57:45,690 --> 03:57:46,250
Okay.

6572
03:57:46,250 --> 03:57:46,310
Okay.

6573
03:57:46,950 --> 03:57:48,990
There's no hoglins around here.

6574
03:57:49,690 --> 03:57:51,710
But we maybe should...

6575
03:57:51,710 --> 03:57:53,050
I don't know what to do first.

6576
03:57:53,070 --> 03:57:54,170
I'm just gonna go this way.

6577
03:57:54,930 --> 03:57:55,830
Where did you go?

6578
03:57:56,130 --> 03:57:56,390
Up?

6579
03:57:56,890 --> 03:57:57,410
Here, here.

6580
03:57:57,450 --> 03:57:59,870
Oh, you're going up that way?

6581
03:57:59,950 --> 03:58:00,070
Okay.

6582
03:58:01,890 --> 03:58:04,250
I don't know, I just feel safer going up.

6583
03:58:04,670 --> 03:58:05,910
Wait, that's the chicken.

6584
03:58:06,130 --> 03:58:06,590
Where are you?

6585
03:58:06,670 --> 03:58:07,290
Oh, no, I see you.

6586
03:58:07,510 --> 03:58:08,050
Yeah, I'm here.

6587
03:58:08,670 --> 03:58:10,310
I guess chickens were originally in hell.

6588
03:58:11,590 --> 03:58:12,490
Sounds about right.

6589
03:58:12,490 --> 03:58:14,950
Birds are from hell.

6590
03:58:15,490 --> 03:58:15,890
Yeah.

6591
03:58:16,510 --> 03:58:18,310
As a fellow bird, I agree.

6592
03:58:19,010 --> 03:58:19,350
I know.

6593
03:58:21,010 --> 03:58:22,170
Alright, I got the nugget.

6594
03:58:22,230 --> 03:58:23,970
Oh, there's a Shriner down there.

6595
03:58:25,450 --> 03:58:26,490
We don't need him.

6596
03:58:26,610 --> 03:58:27,310
We don't need him.

6597
03:58:27,970 --> 03:58:29,430
He can live here for all I care.

6598
03:58:29,830 --> 03:58:31,890
Yeah, I'm sure he wants to otherwise.

6599
03:58:31,990 --> 03:58:32,990
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

6600
03:58:33,030 --> 03:58:34,790
When you take him out...

6601
03:58:34,790 --> 03:58:35,230
Oh, there he is!

6602
03:58:35,530 --> 03:58:36,550
There's a pig!

6603
03:58:37,170 --> 03:58:38,510
It's time to feed you.

6604
03:58:38,510 --> 03:58:40,570
Okay, take...

6605
03:58:40,570 --> 03:58:41,250
Take the gold!

6606
03:58:42,470 --> 03:58:44,090
Let him observe, let him observe.

6607
03:58:44,310 --> 03:58:45,170
Observe, observe.

6608
03:58:45,950 --> 03:58:47,410
Oh, no, the guy's over there.

6609
03:58:47,870 --> 03:58:48,570
What did I get?

6610
03:58:48,650 --> 03:58:49,250
I got obsidian.

6611
03:58:49,410 --> 03:58:50,270
I got three obsidian.

6612
03:58:50,430 --> 03:58:50,870
That's cool.

6613
03:58:51,110 --> 03:58:52,550
It's not like we don't need that anymore.

6614
03:58:53,110 --> 03:58:54,470
Oh, he's taking it, he's taking it, he's taking it.

6615
03:58:55,010 --> 03:58:55,430
Feed him.

6616
03:58:55,450 --> 03:58:56,250
There's another guy up there.

6617
03:58:56,290 --> 03:58:56,910
I'll go to him.

6618
03:58:57,070 --> 03:58:57,770
Yeah, you go to him.

6619
03:58:57,830 --> 03:58:58,650
I'll feed this guy.

6620
03:59:00,390 --> 03:59:01,830
What the fuck did he...

6621
03:59:01,830 --> 03:59:02,790
He gave me gravel?

6622
03:59:03,290 --> 03:59:05,430
I gave you gold, sir!

6623
03:59:07,290 --> 03:59:09,190
And you gave me gravel?

6624
03:59:11,570 --> 03:59:12,970
He gave me fire...

6625
03:59:12,970 --> 03:59:14,090
Oh, my God, he's useless.

6626
03:59:16,390 --> 03:59:17,390
He's actually useless.

6627
03:59:17,730 --> 03:59:19,550
Oh, he's right near me.

6628
03:59:19,550 --> 03:59:21,010
He's next to me, he's next to me, he's next to me.

6629
03:59:21,070 --> 03:59:23,050
I try to ping, I try to ping.

6630
03:59:27,970 --> 03:59:29,790
I press middle mouse button.

6631
03:59:30,310 --> 03:59:31,750
Oh, he's looking at me.

6632
03:59:32,170 --> 03:59:33,210
Oh, God.

6633
03:59:33,270 --> 03:59:34,130
What do we do?

6634
03:59:34,130 --> 03:59:34,210
What do we do?

6635
03:59:37,230 --> 03:59:38,610
Oh, he's right by the...

6636
03:59:38,610 --> 03:59:39,310
By our...

6637
03:59:39,310 --> 03:59:42,650
By our portal, even.

6638
03:59:42,970 --> 03:59:43,630
What an asshole.

6639
03:59:44,090 --> 03:59:46,050
He gave me leather?

6640
03:59:47,830 --> 03:59:48,930
Your guy sucks.

6641
03:59:50,010 --> 03:59:51,510
Oh, did he give you anything good?

6642
03:59:51,630 --> 03:59:52,670
He gave me blackstone.

6643
03:59:52,690 --> 03:59:54,410
I haven't talked to him yet, because of the...

6644
03:59:54,410 --> 03:59:55,370
The gas.

6645
03:59:55,650 --> 03:59:56,470
Okay, come here.

6646
03:59:57,150 --> 03:59:57,870
Hey, come here.

6647
03:59:58,230 --> 03:59:58,630
Oh, my God.

6648
03:59:58,750 --> 04:00:00,670
He keeps giving me blackstone.

6649
04:00:02,850 --> 04:00:04,470
I keep getting...

6650
04:00:04,470 --> 04:00:05,810
I keep getting gravel and blackstone.

6651
04:00:06,290 --> 04:00:07,630
Oh, he gave me...

6652
04:00:07,630 --> 04:00:08,330
Boots.

6653
04:00:08,950 --> 04:00:09,690
Enchanted boots.

6654
04:00:11,270 --> 04:00:12,190
Oh, please.

6655
04:00:13,590 --> 04:00:14,310
I don't need this.

6656
04:00:18,400 --> 04:00:20,060
He just took my...

6657
04:00:20,060 --> 04:00:21,400
The boots and put them on.

6658
04:00:22,400 --> 04:00:24,120
He stole your...

6659
04:00:24,120 --> 04:00:25,380
He stole the boots.

6660
04:00:25,400 --> 04:00:28,120
Oh, I got nether... Oh, you don't need nether bricks either.

6661
04:00:28,300 --> 04:00:29,340
Hey, hey, hey, come here, come here.

6662
04:00:29,340 --> 04:00:31,640
Yeah, yeah, take that.

6663
04:00:31,740 --> 04:00:33,620
I got fucking... Oh, my God.

6664
04:00:33,740 --> 04:00:35,380
Give me something good.

6665
04:00:35,480 --> 04:00:37,640
I don't need blackstone or...

6666
04:00:37,640 --> 04:00:38,840
How is this big?

6667
04:00:39,920 --> 04:00:40,900
Special arrows.

6668
04:00:42,600 --> 04:00:43,680
I got that too.

6669
04:00:44,360 --> 04:00:46,600
This is the worst gacha I ever had.

6670
04:00:47,820 --> 04:00:48,860
Oh, I got iron boots.

6671
04:00:49,120 --> 04:00:50,800
He gave me fucking iron boots.

6672
04:00:51,300 --> 04:00:52,320
Soul speed, okay.

6673
04:00:52,720 --> 04:00:54,440
I'm just gonna give him the whole thing.

6674
04:00:54,520 --> 04:00:54,880
Here you go.

6675
04:00:55,160 --> 04:00:57,280
I'm losing the gacha right now.

6676
04:00:57,280 --> 04:00:59,460
I'm not doing well with this gacha.

6677
04:00:59,720 --> 04:01:01,420
I'm not...

6678
04:01:02,400 --> 04:01:03,800
I'm ditching this one.

6679
04:01:03,940 --> 04:01:04,680
I'll give it...

6680
04:01:04,680 --> 04:01:05,860
Do you have better gacha?

6681
04:01:07,440 --> 04:01:08,340
What did he just give me?

6682
04:01:08,960 --> 04:01:09,900
I can't tell.

6683
04:01:09,980 --> 04:01:11,160
My inventory is full.

6684
04:01:12,140 --> 04:01:13,460
You have better gacha?

6685
04:01:13,800 --> 04:01:15,320
You gave me string?

6686
04:01:16,860 --> 04:01:18,000
Here's my last gold.

6687
04:01:19,780 --> 04:01:22,180
Oh, I gave him a gold.

6688
04:01:22,640 --> 04:01:23,180
Oh, my gosh.

6689
04:01:23,180 --> 04:01:25,740
Did he just drop it?

6690
04:01:25,820 --> 04:01:27,220
What did he give me?

6691
04:01:28,020 --> 04:01:30,800
He gave me another stack of string.

6692
04:01:33,600 --> 04:01:35,600
This is kind of bad, Doki.

6693
04:01:35,680 --> 04:01:36,380
I think we're in trouble.

6694
04:01:37,440 --> 04:01:38,560
I got...

6695
04:01:38,560 --> 04:01:41,980
I got some soul sand.

6696
04:01:42,520 --> 04:01:43,240
Come here, come here.

6697
04:01:43,920 --> 04:01:44,940
Come here, come here.

6698
04:01:45,260 --> 04:01:46,700
I didn't get anything.

6699
04:01:48,780 --> 04:01:49,560
Oh, God.

6700
04:01:49,700 --> 04:01:50,900
I didn't get anything.

6701
04:01:50,900 --> 04:01:51,160
Oh, shit.

6702
04:01:58,970 --> 04:02:00,970
He came out of nowhere.

6703
04:02:01,530 --> 04:02:02,870
He came out of nowhere.

6704
04:02:03,670 --> 04:02:04,810
I see him.

6705
04:02:05,230 --> 04:02:06,430
I see him.

6706
04:02:06,750 --> 04:02:08,250
I see him.

6707
04:02:08,710 --> 04:02:09,570
Oh, my God.

6708
04:02:10,010 --> 04:02:11,730
Oh, my God.

6709
04:02:12,290 --> 04:02:13,610
Oh, there's two of them.

6710
04:02:15,030 --> 04:02:16,590
They're looking at you.

6711
04:02:16,710 --> 04:02:17,970
They're looking at you.

6712
04:02:18,410 --> 04:02:19,750
Sir, I have one more gold.

6713
04:02:19,970 --> 04:02:20,730
Sir, please.

6714
04:02:22,380 --> 04:02:24,230
I have one more gold.

6715
04:02:24,970 --> 04:02:25,790
Oh, my God.

6716
04:02:25,870 --> 04:02:27,170
I have one more gold.

6717
04:02:27,590 --> 04:02:28,090
Please.

6718
04:02:28,330 --> 04:02:31,910
Please, just one ender pearl.

6719
04:02:32,910 --> 04:02:35,290
I have my last...

6720
04:02:35,290 --> 04:02:36,730
Don't I have any?

6721
04:02:38,970 --> 04:02:39,970
Why gravel?

6722
04:02:40,230 --> 04:02:40,590
I don't have a bow.

6723
04:02:42,350 --> 04:02:43,350
Why gravel?

6724
04:02:44,490 --> 04:02:44,990
Why?

6725
04:02:46,070 --> 04:02:47,270
Do you think they'll see me if I go down there?

6726
04:02:49,850 --> 04:02:50,590
Oh, my God.

6727
04:02:50,590 --> 04:02:51,750
Wait, where are you?

6728
04:02:52,110 --> 04:02:53,010
I'm afraid to deflect.

6729
04:02:54,790 --> 04:02:55,790
Okay, um...

6730
04:02:55,790 --> 04:02:56,470
What's the plan?

6731
04:02:58,470 --> 04:02:59,970
I'm a little scared.

6732
04:03:00,970 --> 04:03:01,570
Of what?

6733
04:03:01,870 --> 04:03:02,930
I'm a little scared.

6734
04:03:03,590 --> 04:03:04,050
Of what?

6735
04:03:04,210 --> 04:03:04,870
Of dying.

6736
04:03:05,450 --> 04:03:05,930
Of the lava.

6737
04:03:06,550 --> 04:03:07,810
What do you mean?

6738
04:03:11,130 --> 04:03:13,010
Oh, he's looking at you.

6739
04:03:13,090 --> 04:03:13,430
Oh, my God.

6740
04:03:13,530 --> 04:03:14,010
I'm gonna die.

6741
04:03:14,650 --> 04:03:16,250
Doki, doki.

6742
04:03:16,250 --> 04:03:18,070
Doki, I think I'm dead.

6743
04:03:19,530 --> 04:03:20,130
Okay.

6744
04:03:21,130 --> 04:03:22,990
I'm just on fire a little bit.

6745
04:03:23,630 --> 04:03:24,030
Oh, God.

6746
04:03:25,090 --> 04:03:27,690
I would be so sad.

6747
04:03:29,610 --> 04:03:31,370
How do we deflect them again?

6748
04:03:31,850 --> 04:03:33,970
You just hit it with your sword.

6749
04:03:34,650 --> 04:03:34,970
Okay.

6750
04:03:36,690 --> 04:03:38,530
Like you're playing b-ball.

6751
04:03:38,810 --> 04:03:39,990
Alright, I got this.

6752
04:03:40,370 --> 04:03:41,010
I mean, baseball, not b-ball.

6753
04:03:41,410 --> 04:03:42,530
I can do this.

6754
04:03:43,290 --> 04:03:43,690
Alright.

6755
04:03:44,130 --> 04:03:45,570
Why are you scared of deflecting?

6756
04:03:46,470 --> 04:03:47,890
Because I'm not good at it.

6757
04:03:48,150 --> 04:03:49,250
I've only done it once.

6758
04:03:49,510 --> 04:03:50,270
Okay, I'm ready.

6759
04:03:51,110 --> 04:03:51,810
Look at me.

6760
04:03:51,890 --> 04:03:53,590
Why is he always looking at you and not me?

6761
04:03:54,050 --> 04:03:54,990
Where are you?

6762
04:03:55,110 --> 04:03:57,150
Yeah, he's right there.

6763
04:03:57,230 --> 04:03:58,470
But he's not looking at me.

6764
04:03:59,890 --> 04:04:00,890
I don't know.

6765
04:04:01,970 --> 04:04:03,110
Wait, we didn't get the portal.

6766
04:04:03,150 --> 04:04:04,190
Wait, wait, wait.

6767
04:04:04,270 --> 04:04:04,870
Portal coordinates.

6768
04:04:05,130 --> 04:04:07,150
No, I got the portal coordinates.

6769
04:04:07,370 --> 04:04:08,750
How do we wanna go?

6770
04:04:08,750 --> 04:04:09,630
Where do we go?

6771
04:04:10,390 --> 04:04:11,810
It's literally right down there.

6772
04:04:12,130 --> 04:04:15,050
No, I meant like where do we go to try to find the fortress?

6773
04:04:15,950 --> 04:04:16,850
Wherever we can.

6774
04:04:17,030 --> 04:04:17,670
I don't know.

6775
04:04:18,010 --> 04:04:19,370
Fortresses are random.

6776
04:04:19,710 --> 04:04:21,810
Wait, I think I see one right over there.

6777
04:04:21,890 --> 04:04:22,090
Wait, really?

6778
04:04:22,810 --> 04:04:24,810
Unless that's just built strangely.

6779
04:04:24,850 --> 04:04:25,410
Let's just go.

6780
04:04:25,530 --> 04:04:26,390
Let's just check it out.

6781
04:04:27,390 --> 04:04:30,190
Also get magma cubes because we need...

6782
04:04:30,710 --> 04:04:32,800
We need magma stuff for...

6783
04:04:33,550 --> 04:04:34,150
For what?

6784
04:04:34,950 --> 04:04:35,870
For potions.

6785
04:04:35,870 --> 04:04:36,430
Oh my gosh.

6786
04:04:36,570 --> 04:04:37,410
Get out of the way, Piggy.

6787
04:04:37,470 --> 04:04:39,130
I have a fire charge.

6788
04:04:39,710 --> 04:04:41,270
How many fire charges do we need?

6789
04:04:41,410 --> 04:04:42,330
No, it's magma.

6790
04:04:42,430 --> 04:04:43,250
It's not fire charge.

6791
04:04:43,350 --> 04:04:44,230
It's a magma slime.

6792
04:04:48,170 --> 04:04:49,230
Who hit me?

6793
04:04:49,730 --> 04:04:50,330
Not me.

6794
04:04:51,410 --> 04:04:53,490
I think it's the...

6795
04:04:53,490 --> 04:04:54,190
It's the magma.

6796
04:04:55,210 --> 04:04:57,190
Okay, I give up.

6797
04:04:57,370 --> 04:04:58,330
The guy is too close.

6798
04:04:59,510 --> 04:05:01,850
So if we go over this way...

6799
04:05:01,850 --> 04:05:02,390
Where did you go?

6800
04:05:02,390 --> 04:05:03,850
Where did you go?

6801
04:05:04,930 --> 04:05:05,410
Follow me.

6802
04:05:05,530 --> 04:05:06,330
Up here, up here.

6803
04:05:06,690 --> 04:05:08,730
We're going around this lava.

6804
04:05:10,550 --> 04:05:11,530
We're going around it.

6805
04:05:11,870 --> 04:05:13,710
Just go up it.

6806
04:05:14,250 --> 04:05:15,750
Be careful of the other lava though.

6807
04:05:16,490 --> 04:05:17,570
Here we go.

6808
04:05:18,010 --> 04:05:19,970
Why are we so close to that lava?

6809
04:05:20,790 --> 04:05:22,630
Why do we have to...

6810
04:05:22,630 --> 04:05:24,610
be right next to it?

6811
04:05:24,770 --> 04:05:25,270
I don't know.

6812
04:05:26,150 --> 04:05:26,690
I don't know.

6813
04:05:26,950 --> 04:05:28,890
We don't have to be next to it.

6814
04:05:28,890 --> 04:05:30,230
It's fun.

6815
04:05:31,090 --> 04:05:32,530
I don't think it's fun.

6816
04:05:32,690 --> 04:05:35,250
You're getting closer to the lava than me.

6817
04:05:36,190 --> 04:05:38,250
This pig is right on you.

6818
04:05:38,750 --> 04:05:40,130
Leave us alone.

6819
04:05:40,810 --> 04:05:41,950
He's our biggest fan.

6820
04:05:43,730 --> 04:05:44,990
Where are you going?

6821
04:05:45,350 --> 04:05:45,730
Here.

6822
04:05:46,270 --> 04:05:47,430
We're going up.

6823
04:05:47,770 --> 04:05:49,170
What do you mean?

6824
04:05:50,130 --> 04:05:51,030
I'm up.

6825
04:05:51,370 --> 04:05:52,130
What are you doing?

6826
04:05:52,390 --> 04:05:53,370
Where are you?

6827
04:05:55,030 --> 04:05:56,390
Just kidding.

6828
04:05:57,950 --> 04:06:00,390
I'm doing the wrong thing, I guess.

6829
04:06:03,430 --> 04:06:05,210
My fire texture looks really good.

6830
04:06:05,390 --> 04:06:08,210
I guess I was doing the wrong thing.

6831
04:06:08,510 --> 04:06:09,670
You were doing the wrong...

6832
04:06:09,670 --> 04:06:11,430
You're always doing the wrong thing.

6833
04:06:12,050 --> 04:06:13,930
I think I didn't actually see one.

6834
04:06:14,050 --> 04:06:15,490
Maybe it was just a strange texture.

6835
04:06:16,090 --> 04:06:18,110
No, I thought it was one in the distance.

6836
04:06:18,330 --> 04:06:19,110
Is that not it?

6837
04:06:20,290 --> 04:06:21,730
What is that over there?

6838
04:06:23,010 --> 04:06:23,490
What?

6839
04:06:23,490 --> 04:06:25,830
Oh, it's just like little...

6840
04:06:25,830 --> 04:06:26,610
little trees.

6841
04:06:27,390 --> 04:06:29,130
We don't want to go in there, though.

6842
04:06:29,530 --> 04:06:31,090
That's where the big pigs are, right?

6843
04:06:31,190 --> 04:06:32,370
Yeah, we hate those guys.

6844
04:06:33,870 --> 04:06:34,630
We'll just...

6845
04:06:34,630 --> 04:06:37,150
We'll just go back here.

6846
04:06:37,630 --> 04:06:38,030
Okay.

6847
04:06:38,850 --> 04:06:39,650
We might as well.

6848
04:06:41,390 --> 04:06:42,750
There's no other way to go.

6849
04:06:44,110 --> 04:06:45,690
We'll grab some mushrooms in case.

6850
04:06:46,190 --> 04:06:47,250
Is there any pigs around?

6851
04:06:47,490 --> 04:06:48,910
I'm gonna grab this gold.

6852
04:06:49,690 --> 04:06:50,710
I don't think I see any.

6853
04:06:53,790 --> 04:06:54,730
I'm checking.

6854
04:06:55,690 --> 04:06:56,670
Watch my back.

6855
04:06:57,790 --> 04:06:58,230
I'm watching.

6856
04:06:58,590 --> 04:06:59,510
There's nothing here.

6857
04:07:00,190 --> 04:07:01,850
There's literally nobody next to you.

6858
04:07:02,230 --> 04:07:02,530
Okay.

6859
04:07:02,810 --> 04:07:03,970
You're so safe.

6860
04:07:04,250 --> 04:07:05,950
You're so safe right now.

6861
04:07:06,150 --> 04:07:06,250
Okay.

6862
04:07:06,430 --> 04:07:06,630
Alright.

6863
04:07:07,130 --> 04:07:07,550
Cool.

6864
04:07:08,210 --> 04:07:09,330
What can I throw away?

6865
04:07:09,890 --> 04:07:10,970
Soul speed, go away.

6866
04:07:11,230 --> 04:07:12,610
Do we need soul sand?

6867
04:07:12,710 --> 04:07:13,370
We don't, right?

6868
04:07:13,770 --> 04:07:14,070
No.

6869
04:07:15,230 --> 04:07:17,150
I'm gonna throw away the gravel.

6870
04:07:18,790 --> 04:07:19,350
And...

6871
04:07:19,350 --> 04:07:20,610
The crying obsidian.

6872
04:07:20,610 --> 04:07:22,030
Hey, why were you so far away?

6873
04:07:22,110 --> 04:07:22,710
What the hell, man?

6874
04:07:22,710 --> 04:07:23,110
What do you mean?

6875
04:07:23,210 --> 04:07:24,850
I was scouting you out.

6876
04:07:26,270 --> 04:07:28,610
I had to be high ground.

6877
04:07:31,210 --> 04:07:32,250
Oh, there's gold right here.

6878
04:07:32,370 --> 04:07:32,670
Nice.

6879
04:07:33,070 --> 04:07:33,430
Watch out!

6880
04:07:33,570 --> 04:07:33,810
No, no, no.

6881
04:07:34,170 --> 04:07:34,950
Oh, okay.

6882
04:07:37,410 --> 04:07:38,930
The zombie guys are safe.

6883
04:07:39,730 --> 04:07:41,870
Wait, do they get mad if I farm their gold?

6884
04:07:42,430 --> 04:07:42,750
Yeah.

6885
04:07:43,070 --> 04:07:43,650
Wait, they do?

6886
04:07:44,210 --> 04:07:45,150
Yeah, they get jealous.

6887
04:07:46,190 --> 04:07:47,070
No, they don't.

6888
04:07:47,070 --> 04:07:49,070
Oh, we can get...

6889
04:07:49,890 --> 04:07:51,290
Hey, what the fuck, man?

6890
04:07:54,090 --> 04:07:55,950
Grab a blue mushroom.

6891
04:07:56,110 --> 04:07:56,630
Wait, what for?

6892
04:07:56,810 --> 04:07:58,630
And then, we can also probably...

6893
04:07:58,630 --> 04:07:59,990
They scare away the big hogs.

6894
04:08:00,210 --> 04:08:01,070
Oh, they do?

6895
04:08:02,430 --> 04:08:02,830
See?

6896
04:08:03,010 --> 04:08:04,410
You're a Minecraft expert.

6897
04:08:05,230 --> 04:08:07,530
We can also probably...

6898
04:08:07,530 --> 04:08:08,730
How do they scare them away?

6899
04:08:08,750 --> 04:08:10,690
Do we just take it out and be like...

6900
04:08:10,690 --> 04:08:11,810
Be gone.

6901
04:08:13,250 --> 04:08:13,850
Oh, really?

6902
04:08:13,850 --> 04:08:15,650
But Warp Forest is good.

6903
04:08:15,730 --> 04:08:16,870
This is where all the endermen are.

6904
04:08:16,950 --> 04:08:18,210
We can just farm endermen here.

6905
04:08:19,650 --> 04:08:20,570
Where are they?

6906
04:08:21,170 --> 04:08:21,990
I see one.

6907
04:08:22,910 --> 04:08:23,550
Look at it.

6908
04:08:23,590 --> 04:08:24,590
Look at it right now.

6909
04:08:25,610 --> 04:08:26,570
Look at him.

6910
04:08:27,050 --> 04:08:27,810
Where is he?

6911
04:08:27,850 --> 04:08:28,250
Where is he?

6912
04:08:28,290 --> 04:08:28,950
I'm gonna look at him.

6913
04:08:30,150 --> 04:08:30,830
Do you see him?

6914
04:08:31,270 --> 04:08:32,050
Yeah, I'm looking at him.

6915
04:08:33,430 --> 04:08:34,510
He's not angry.

6916
04:08:35,670 --> 04:08:36,730
Look at him closer.

6917
04:08:37,850 --> 04:08:38,210
Okay.

6918
04:08:42,470 --> 04:08:44,050
Maybe let's build a little house.

6919
04:08:44,050 --> 04:08:44,970
He's not angry.

6920
04:08:45,770 --> 04:08:46,950
I'm gonna build something.

6921
04:08:47,310 --> 04:08:48,730
Look at me.

6922
04:08:49,090 --> 04:08:52,270
Look at me right now.

6923
04:08:53,890 --> 04:08:55,290
Yeah, I'm looking at you.

6924
04:08:55,770 --> 04:08:57,750
Do you think this is good enough?

6925
04:08:57,950 --> 04:08:58,490
Oh my god.

6926
04:08:58,710 --> 04:08:59,390
Get under here, Doki.

6927
04:08:59,710 --> 04:09:00,230
Get under here.

6928
04:09:03,270 --> 04:09:04,470
He didn't like it.

6929
04:09:05,070 --> 04:09:09,370
Oh, I looked it in his eyes.

6930
04:09:09,510 --> 04:09:10,430
He was not happy.

6931
04:09:11,230 --> 04:09:13,730
Okay, you didn't drop anything.

6932
04:09:13,950 --> 04:09:14,830
You guys, I got the portal coordinates.

6933
04:09:14,990 --> 04:09:18,110
I don't know why you guys are like, rip the portal coordinates.

6934
04:09:18,210 --> 04:09:19,370
I literally got them.

6935
04:09:19,830 --> 04:09:20,950
Alright, we did it.

6936
04:09:22,790 --> 04:09:24,490
See, I ain't no coward.

6937
04:09:24,810 --> 04:09:25,610
I looked at it.

6938
04:09:26,650 --> 04:09:28,010
No, he didn't drop any.

6939
04:09:28,470 --> 04:09:29,210
Oh, shit.

6940
04:09:30,650 --> 04:09:31,910
He didn't drop any.

6941
04:09:32,970 --> 04:09:34,490
I don't think fortune would have mattered.

6942
04:09:35,110 --> 04:09:36,190
Don't fall here.

6943
04:09:36,390 --> 04:09:38,190
There was a hole right there.

6944
04:09:38,190 --> 04:09:38,630
I know.

6945
04:09:39,050 --> 04:09:40,250
This is kind of a bad spot.

6946
04:09:40,350 --> 04:09:41,810
Hold on, I'm gonna pick up shop.

6947
04:09:42,710 --> 04:09:43,890
Pick up shop?

6948
04:09:43,950 --> 04:09:44,810
We're gonna move shop.

6949
04:09:45,310 --> 04:09:46,310
Yeah, we're gonna move shop.

6950
04:09:47,910 --> 04:09:48,990
I'm gonna go this way.

6951
04:09:49,810 --> 04:09:52,590
Maybe we should have got fire resistance before we did this.

6952
04:09:53,110 --> 04:09:53,330
Maybe.

6953
04:09:54,110 --> 04:09:55,070
Oh, yeah.

6954
04:09:55,190 --> 04:09:56,390
I told you.

6955
04:09:56,750 --> 04:09:57,230
I told you.

6956
04:09:57,510 --> 04:09:58,470
Just a maybe.

6957
04:09:59,010 --> 04:09:59,630
Where did you go?

6958
04:10:00,630 --> 04:10:01,890
Make a shop.

6959
04:10:02,270 --> 04:10:03,590
There's so many endermans here.

6960
04:10:04,130 --> 04:10:04,450
Okay.

6961
04:10:05,370 --> 04:10:06,090
Shop where?

6962
04:10:07,330 --> 04:10:08,190
I see two.

6963
04:10:09,290 --> 04:10:10,090
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6964
04:10:10,850 --> 04:10:11,910
It's shop time.

6965
04:10:12,170 --> 04:10:12,910
Shop time.

6966
04:10:13,110 --> 04:10:13,470
This is it.

6967
04:10:13,710 --> 04:10:16,230
This is where we set up the family business.

6968
04:10:16,370 --> 04:10:17,370
Let me know when to look.

6969
04:10:17,650 --> 04:10:18,330
I'm ready.

6970
04:10:18,530 --> 04:10:19,410
Don't look yet.

6971
04:10:19,750 --> 04:10:20,710
I'm ready to look.

6972
04:10:20,990 --> 04:10:21,670
Don't look yet.

6973
04:10:22,130 --> 04:10:23,130
I'm gonna look.

6974
04:10:24,610 --> 04:10:25,570
That's your...

6975
04:10:25,990 --> 04:10:26,950
If you feel safe.

6976
04:10:27,650 --> 04:10:28,830
Where's the second one?

6977
04:10:29,750 --> 04:10:30,570
Oh, there he is.

6978
04:10:31,410 --> 04:10:32,350
Oh, I see one.

6979
04:10:32,350 --> 04:10:32,750
Oh.

6980
04:10:35,190 --> 04:10:35,770
Oh, my God.

6981
04:10:40,410 --> 04:10:41,130
Oh, God.

6982
04:10:41,590 --> 04:10:42,190
Where did he go?

6983
04:10:42,890 --> 04:10:43,430
He's dead.

6984
04:10:43,510 --> 04:10:43,770
He's dead.

6985
04:10:46,630 --> 04:10:48,550
Okay, I got a little worried.

6986
04:10:49,890 --> 04:10:51,930
Now we have to worry about a gas tool.

6987
04:10:52,230 --> 04:10:53,710
This is not the place to set up shop.

6988
04:10:54,290 --> 04:10:54,690
Oh, my God.

6989
04:10:54,690 --> 04:10:55,830
I hear him crying.

6990
04:10:56,070 --> 04:10:56,410
Oh, my God.

6991
04:10:56,410 --> 04:10:57,570
Why did you do it again?

6992
04:10:57,630 --> 04:10:59,190
There's literally a gas on the run.

6993
04:10:59,190 --> 04:11:00,210
I'm gonna look at him.

6994
04:11:00,350 --> 04:11:01,210
I'm gonna do it.

6995
04:11:02,110 --> 04:11:03,410
I'm gonna look at him.

6996
04:11:03,670 --> 04:11:04,750
Where is the gas?

6997
04:11:05,070 --> 04:11:06,510
He's like all the way over there.

6998
04:11:06,570 --> 04:11:07,770
How do we make a bow?

6999
04:11:07,870 --> 04:11:09,030
Do we have enough stuff for it?

7000
04:11:09,390 --> 04:11:10,230
I have string.

7001
04:11:11,030 --> 04:11:12,690
A boat or a bow?

7002
04:11:12,950 --> 04:11:13,690
A bow.

7003
04:11:15,130 --> 04:11:15,750
I can.

7004
04:11:16,170 --> 04:11:16,690
Oh, my gosh.

7005
04:11:16,710 --> 04:11:17,110
I can.

7006
04:11:17,230 --> 04:11:18,170
Oh, my God.

7007
04:11:18,430 --> 04:11:18,870
Yes.

7008
04:11:19,010 --> 04:11:19,930
Am I looking at him?

7009
04:11:20,430 --> 04:11:21,530
Am I looking at him?

7010
04:11:21,550 --> 04:11:22,410
Am I looking at him?

7011
04:11:23,070 --> 04:11:26,670
Okay, do something about it.

7012
04:11:26,670 --> 04:11:27,090
I don't know.

7013
04:11:27,090 --> 04:11:28,150
Where did he go?

7014
04:11:29,910 --> 04:11:31,330
Oh, he's not happy.

7015
04:11:32,250 --> 04:11:32,810
Kill him.

7016
04:11:33,550 --> 04:11:34,250
I don't know where he went.

7017
04:11:34,830 --> 04:11:35,890
Just stay under the rocks.

7018
04:11:36,130 --> 04:11:36,750
He'll come back.

7019
04:11:38,210 --> 04:11:39,050
He's just staring at me.

7020
04:11:39,050 --> 04:11:40,130
Oh, my spectral arrows.

7021
04:11:40,250 --> 04:11:40,670
That's right.

7022
04:11:40,970 --> 04:11:43,430
You guys are so smart.

7023
04:11:43,510 --> 04:11:43,750
Hello.

7024
04:11:44,010 --> 04:11:45,110
What you gonna do?

7025
04:11:45,590 --> 04:11:46,070
Pussy?

7026
04:11:46,510 --> 04:11:47,230
Yeah, that's right.

7027
04:11:48,010 --> 04:11:49,130
What you gonna do?

7028
04:11:49,450 --> 04:11:49,890
Nothing.

7029
04:11:51,190 --> 04:11:52,310
Yeah, that's right.

7030
04:11:52,910 --> 04:11:53,350
Nothing.

7031
04:11:53,590 --> 04:11:54,650
He's stuck there.

7032
04:11:55,170 --> 04:11:56,270
Was he actually stuck?

7033
04:11:56,350 --> 04:11:57,250
Yeah, he's stuck down there.

7034
04:11:58,570 --> 04:11:59,030
Dummy?

7035
04:11:59,570 --> 04:11:59,910
Yes.

7036
04:12:00,370 --> 04:12:00,830
Stupid.

7037
04:12:01,730 --> 04:12:02,370
Where did he go?

7038
04:12:02,810 --> 04:12:03,650
Where did he go?

7039
04:12:03,990 --> 04:12:05,570
He disappeared.

7040
04:12:06,610 --> 04:12:08,090
I hear the gas again.

7041
04:12:09,270 --> 04:12:10,070
I don't see him.

7042
04:12:10,490 --> 04:12:11,110
I don't either.

7043
04:12:11,510 --> 04:12:12,510
The guy has...

7044
04:12:12,510 --> 04:12:14,030
20-20 vision.

7045
04:12:14,770 --> 04:12:15,110
Oh, my God.

7046
04:12:15,130 --> 04:12:15,610
He's right here.

7047
04:12:16,850 --> 04:12:17,490
That's right.

7048
04:12:17,710 --> 04:12:18,670
What you gonna do?

7049
04:12:19,030 --> 04:12:19,490
Nothing.

7050
04:12:21,770 --> 04:12:24,430
Why aren't you under the...

7051
04:12:24,430 --> 04:12:26,210
Stay under the 2x2.

7052
04:12:26,230 --> 04:12:26,970
Oh, he's right here.

7053
04:12:27,490 --> 04:12:29,590
He's on it!

7054
04:12:38,350 --> 04:12:43,490
I got enderpearl.

7055
04:12:43,930 --> 04:12:45,170
Okay, nice.

7056
04:12:45,530 --> 04:12:47,930
First enderpearl, everybody.

7057
04:12:48,430 --> 04:12:50,010
We got a first enderpearl.

7058
04:12:51,090 --> 04:12:52,170
First enderpearl.

7059
04:12:53,370 --> 04:12:54,770
Oh, my God.

7060
04:12:54,890 --> 04:12:55,730
Let's figure this out.

7061
04:12:55,730 --> 04:12:57,430
People make this look so easy.

7062
04:12:57,790 --> 04:12:59,670
Let's figure this out.

7063
04:13:01,350 --> 04:13:03,630
I don't know where that ghastly is.

7064
04:13:03,730 --> 04:13:04,750
And it's scaring me.

7065
04:13:04,950 --> 04:13:06,550
Stop calling it ghastly.

7066
04:13:06,870 --> 04:13:07,910
I like ghastly.

7067
04:13:08,010 --> 04:13:09,070
I don't like these guys.

7068
04:13:09,770 --> 04:13:11,510
You see the minecraft...

7069
04:13:11,510 --> 04:13:13,490
The minecraft movie version of them?

7070
04:13:14,850 --> 04:13:15,250
No.

7071
04:13:15,730 --> 04:13:16,050
Oh, wait.

7072
04:13:16,130 --> 04:13:16,690
Maybe I did.

7073
04:13:16,830 --> 04:13:18,750
They have, like, hair.

7074
04:13:19,530 --> 04:13:20,030
Ew!

7075
04:13:22,550 --> 04:13:23,890
They're, like, made out of...

7076
04:13:23,890 --> 04:13:25,010
Skin and stuff.

7077
04:13:25,370 --> 04:13:26,570
Shut up, guys.

7078
04:13:26,670 --> 04:13:28,650
Wait, let me...

7079
04:13:29,150 --> 04:13:31,250
You can't pause the game in minecraft.

7080
04:13:31,530 --> 04:13:32,810
Don't use these blocks.

7081
04:13:32,950 --> 04:13:33,430
They suck.

7082
04:13:33,690 --> 04:13:34,110
Why not?

7083
04:13:34,350 --> 04:13:37,790
Because if a ghast gets us, they can blow them up.

7084
04:13:37,870 --> 04:13:38,990
They can't blow up other things.

7085
04:13:39,230 --> 04:13:40,590
They can't blow up clobble.

7086
04:13:41,230 --> 04:13:42,050
Yeah, clobble.

7087
04:13:42,590 --> 04:13:44,090
I have one.

7088
04:13:44,570 --> 04:13:46,030
Hey, what the hell?

7089
04:13:47,430 --> 04:13:49,470
I'm trying to find the ghast!

7090
04:13:51,870 --> 04:13:52,270
Mine...

7091
04:13:52,270 --> 04:13:53,850
Minecraft movie...

7092
04:13:53,850 --> 04:13:54,430
Ghast.

7093
04:13:55,910 --> 04:13:56,310
Ghast.

7094
04:13:59,570 --> 04:14:00,950
This is what they look like.

7095
04:14:01,390 --> 04:14:02,570
They look so ugly.

7096
04:14:02,810 --> 04:14:03,770
They're, like...

7097
04:14:04,470 --> 04:14:05,270
They're, like...

7098
04:14:05,270 --> 04:14:07,890
Made out of skin and, like, hair.

7099
04:14:08,050 --> 04:14:09,350
And it looks so weird.

7100
04:14:09,510 --> 04:14:10,210
Did you send it to me?

7101
04:14:10,510 --> 04:14:10,970
No, not yet.

7102
04:14:11,010 --> 04:14:11,810
I'm trying to find discord.

7103
04:14:13,390 --> 04:14:15,470
Where did my discord go?

7104
04:14:16,890 --> 04:14:17,870
Wait, where is it?

7105
04:14:17,870 --> 04:14:19,390
Oh my God, he sounds so close.

7106
04:14:19,530 --> 04:14:20,370
Oh wait, here it is.

7107
04:14:20,470 --> 04:14:21,530
Oh my God, I see him!

7108
04:14:21,930 --> 04:14:23,190
Oh my God, he's really close.

7109
04:14:23,330 --> 04:14:25,370
Oh my God, if we were still over there, we would've been dead.

7110
04:14:26,770 --> 04:14:28,350
Alright, this is what they look like.

7111
04:14:31,150 --> 04:14:32,850
Hold on, I'm trying to fight this guy.

7112
04:14:33,370 --> 04:14:34,370
Wait, you're fighting?

7113
04:14:35,970 --> 04:14:37,170
Oh, he's too far!

7114
04:14:37,390 --> 04:14:38,230
What the hell?

7115
04:14:38,890 --> 04:14:39,630
Wait, where are you?

7116
04:14:40,070 --> 04:14:40,730
I'm right here.

7117
04:14:40,770 --> 04:14:41,450
I'm right next to you.

7118
04:14:42,090 --> 04:14:42,630
You're not.

7119
04:14:44,290 --> 04:14:44,750
Ew!

7120
04:14:46,030 --> 04:14:47,490
Oh my God!

7121
04:14:48,970 --> 04:14:50,610
Why'd they make them look like that?

7122
04:14:50,710 --> 04:14:51,690
They're made of skin.

7123
04:14:53,150 --> 04:14:55,590
It's skin and there's like a little bit of hair on it.

7124
04:14:56,610 --> 04:14:58,910
Okay, so the gas is like...

7125
04:14:58,910 --> 04:14:59,770
where I'm looking.

7126
04:14:59,990 --> 04:15:01,370
It's like that direction.

7127
04:15:01,690 --> 04:15:02,890
Oh, we don't have to look there.

7128
04:15:02,930 --> 04:15:03,790
We can just go forward.

7129
04:15:04,990 --> 04:15:06,430
We made the bridge.

7130
04:15:07,390 --> 04:15:08,510
We might as well just go forward.

7131
04:15:11,390 --> 04:15:12,490
We'll find more Endermen.

7132
04:15:12,550 --> 04:15:13,650
Where are the Endermen?

7133
04:15:13,770 --> 04:15:14,630
Oh, I see one!

7134
04:15:14,930 --> 04:15:15,550
We're setting up shop!

7135
04:15:15,710 --> 04:15:16,710
Set up shop!

7136
04:15:18,450 --> 04:15:20,130
Wait, where do you see him?

7137
04:15:23,410 --> 04:15:24,130
Where is he?

7138
04:15:25,070 --> 04:15:26,150
They're all over there.

7139
04:15:26,990 --> 04:15:27,450
I'm looking!

7140
04:15:27,830 --> 04:15:28,190
I'm looking!

7141
04:15:31,410 --> 04:15:32,370
Do you see him?

7142
04:15:33,630 --> 04:15:34,350
He disappeared.

7143
04:15:34,830 --> 04:15:35,590
Oh no, he's right there.

7144
04:15:35,590 --> 04:15:36,550
I'm looking!

7145
04:15:37,150 --> 04:15:38,250
I'm looking right at him!

7146
04:15:39,090 --> 04:15:39,910
I think I got him.

7147
04:15:41,710 --> 04:15:42,570
Alright, nice.

7148
04:15:45,190 --> 04:15:46,310
This is so dumb.

7149
04:15:46,830 --> 04:15:47,690
Another one!

7150
04:15:48,990 --> 04:15:50,810
You said there's another one here?

7151
04:15:51,310 --> 04:15:52,350
I thought I saw one.

7152
04:15:52,510 --> 04:15:53,330
I thought I saw two.

7153
04:15:53,550 --> 04:15:54,230
No, there's one.

7154
04:15:54,630 --> 04:15:57,610
You guys wanna see the ugly thing?

7155
04:15:57,730 --> 04:15:58,130
Hold on.

7156
04:15:58,410 --> 04:16:00,410
Just google Minecraft movie gas.

7157
04:16:00,750 --> 04:16:01,930
Yeah, I'll save it.

7158
04:16:02,010 --> 04:16:03,530
I'll risk my life for you guys.

7159
04:16:03,530 --> 04:16:04,750
I'm destroying a shop.

7160
04:16:05,090 --> 04:16:07,070
I'm gonna go find another Enderman.

7161
04:16:07,290 --> 04:16:07,730
Oh!

7162
04:16:08,810 --> 04:16:09,250
What?

7163
04:16:10,690 --> 04:16:11,630
Setting up shop.

7164
04:16:12,890 --> 04:16:14,210
The shop is set up.

7165
04:16:14,810 --> 04:16:15,910
I found two.

7166
04:16:17,090 --> 04:16:18,330
I'm gonna eat meat before I look.

7167
04:16:18,950 --> 04:16:19,910
Gotta be hungry first.

7168
04:16:19,970 --> 04:16:20,750
Yeah, I'm looking at you.

7169
04:16:21,270 --> 04:16:21,850
Yeah, that's right.

7170
04:16:21,910 --> 04:16:22,910
I'm looking at you.

7171
04:16:23,230 --> 04:16:23,930
Yeah, that's right.

7172
04:16:24,010 --> 04:16:24,690
What you gonna do?

7173
04:16:25,730 --> 04:16:26,530
Yeah, what you gonna do?

7174
04:16:26,570 --> 04:16:27,670
I wanna look into your eyes.

7175
04:16:27,930 --> 04:16:28,610
I ain't scared.

7176
04:16:29,170 --> 04:16:30,630
I wanna look into your eyes.

7177
04:16:30,630 --> 04:16:31,150
Wait.

7178
04:16:31,790 --> 04:16:33,630
Why isn't it aggroing?

7179
04:16:35,630 --> 04:16:37,830
Alright guys, this is what they look like in the movie.

7180
04:16:38,110 --> 04:16:38,630
Wait, he...

7181
04:16:39,490 --> 04:16:40,050
Wait.

7182
04:16:41,150 --> 04:16:41,670
Nasty.

7183
04:16:42,170 --> 04:16:42,770
I'm looking.

7184
04:16:43,950 --> 04:16:44,830
I'm looking.

7185
04:16:45,610 --> 04:16:46,950
Yeah, I'm looking at you.

7186
04:16:47,090 --> 04:16:48,230
I think you're ugly.

7187
04:16:49,250 --> 04:16:50,150
That's right.

7188
04:16:51,750 --> 04:16:52,130
Oh, oh.

7189
04:16:53,590 --> 04:16:54,930
He baited me!

7190
04:16:55,230 --> 04:16:55,570
Wow!

7191
04:16:56,510 --> 04:16:57,390
There you go.

7192
04:16:57,390 --> 04:17:00,230
He ran away and then ran...

7193
04:17:00,230 --> 04:17:00,890
360.

7194
04:17:01,990 --> 04:17:04,610
He baited a 360 at me.

7195
04:17:05,070 --> 04:17:06,050
Oh, he dropped one too.

7196
04:17:06,090 --> 04:17:06,550
He dropped one.

7197
04:17:06,690 --> 04:17:07,090
I got three.

7198
04:17:07,870 --> 04:17:08,010
Okay.

7199
04:17:09,410 --> 04:17:12,430
I can't tell if I aggroed that one or if she did.

7200
04:17:12,830 --> 04:17:14,010
I can't tell either.

7201
04:17:14,910 --> 04:17:16,070
Wait, there was two.

7202
04:17:16,190 --> 04:17:17,610
The other guy despawned.

7203
04:17:17,830 --> 04:17:18,150
No.

7204
04:17:19,110 --> 04:17:19,830
I'll look around too.

7205
04:17:21,090 --> 04:17:21,950
There's two here.

7206
04:17:22,570 --> 04:17:23,030
Nice.

7207
04:17:23,550 --> 04:17:25,610
Okay, I'm gonna keep that shop.

7208
04:17:26,230 --> 04:17:26,910
Keep the...

7209
04:17:26,910 --> 04:17:27,830
Shop is set up.

7210
04:17:29,050 --> 04:17:30,430
It's like our little food truck.

7211
04:17:31,090 --> 04:17:31,330
Yeah.

7212
04:17:33,090 --> 04:17:34,610
As soon as you see one, just run.

7213
04:17:35,010 --> 04:17:36,250
Look and run back to shop.

7214
04:17:37,890 --> 04:17:38,850
Is he following me?

7215
04:17:38,910 --> 04:17:39,530
Is he following me?

7216
04:17:40,330 --> 04:17:42,090
I turned around!

7217
04:17:42,910 --> 04:17:43,970
Oh my God.

7218
04:17:43,970 --> 04:17:47,030
Oh my God, is he chasing me?

7219
04:17:47,070 --> 04:17:47,750
Never look back.

7220
04:17:48,190 --> 04:17:48,990
Never look back.

7221
04:17:51,310 --> 04:17:52,070
Did he drop one?

7222
04:17:52,070 --> 04:17:52,910
I got four.

7223
04:17:53,030 --> 04:17:53,690
Yeah, he dropped one.

7224
04:17:53,790 --> 04:17:54,370
Well, we're getting lucky.

7225
04:17:55,790 --> 04:17:57,510
We're getting lucky with him.

7226
04:18:03,590 --> 04:18:05,530
I don't know if he spawned.

7227
04:18:05,690 --> 04:18:05,950
Come here.

7228
04:18:06,490 --> 04:18:07,630
Drop your goods.

7229
04:18:08,090 --> 04:18:08,930
Drop your goods.

7230
04:18:09,410 --> 04:18:10,170
Drop your goods.

7231
04:18:10,650 --> 04:18:13,610
I don't know.

7232
04:18:13,630 --> 04:18:14,330
He didn't.

7233
04:18:15,190 --> 04:18:16,130
Oh, come on.

7234
04:18:16,150 --> 04:18:16,830
It's just me.

7235
04:18:17,970 --> 04:18:18,830
Oh my God.

7236
04:18:18,930 --> 04:18:22,210
That guy looked at me and then he like...

7237
04:18:22,210 --> 04:18:23,170
and then looked and then ran.

7238
04:18:24,050 --> 04:18:25,990
Oh, it's probably because he was aggroed on me.

7239
04:18:26,310 --> 04:18:27,290
No, no, the other guy.

7240
04:18:27,530 --> 04:18:28,710
I found another Enderman.

7241
04:18:34,250 --> 04:18:34,770
Don't look back.

7242
04:18:35,470 --> 04:18:35,650
Don't look back.

7243
04:18:35,950 --> 04:18:38,490
I look back.

7244
04:18:38,610 --> 04:18:39,150
I look back.

7245
04:18:40,630 --> 04:18:41,110
Oh!

7246
04:18:43,170 --> 04:18:44,590
Yeah, get him in the back!

7247
04:18:45,270 --> 04:18:45,750
Yeah!

7248
04:18:46,710 --> 04:18:48,310
You're in the wrong neighborhood!

7249
04:18:49,350 --> 04:18:50,430
We'll take you out.

7250
04:18:51,110 --> 04:18:52,530
No, he was broke.

7251
04:18:52,650 --> 04:18:54,390
Okay, I need to stop attacking him.

7252
04:18:54,510 --> 04:18:56,630
He was fucking broke.

7253
04:18:57,010 --> 04:18:57,810
It was a broke boy.

7254
04:18:57,810 --> 04:18:59,730
There's a really big drop here.

7255
04:19:00,970 --> 04:19:02,190
Look in the trees too.

7256
04:19:02,190 --> 04:19:04,210
I'm way too confident with jumping around.

7257
04:19:04,650 --> 04:19:05,670
I know.

7258
04:19:06,270 --> 04:19:08,950
I'm like, whoa, there's no holes here.

7259
04:19:13,970 --> 04:19:15,930
Oh, I think that's just a normal Skelly.

7260
04:19:16,170 --> 04:19:17,730
Oh wait, or is that an Enderman up there?

7261
04:19:17,730 --> 04:19:18,830
Oh, that's an Enderman.

7262
04:19:19,230 --> 04:19:20,690
Is it too far?

7263
04:19:21,290 --> 04:19:21,890
Look at him.

7264
04:19:22,010 --> 04:19:23,730
Look him in the eye and ask if it's too far.

7265
04:19:24,850 --> 04:19:26,130
Oh, he disappeared.

7266
04:19:26,470 --> 04:19:27,810
Oh, maybe it was too far.

7267
04:19:28,150 --> 04:19:28,970
He was really far.

7268
04:19:30,770 --> 04:19:32,870
It's a 50% chance to drop.

7269
04:19:34,030 --> 04:19:34,930
Oh wait, I see him!

7270
04:19:36,490 --> 04:19:36,850
Where?

7271
04:19:37,110 --> 04:19:37,890
Oh, I see him too!

7272
04:19:37,990 --> 04:19:39,230
He's really far.

7273
04:19:39,850 --> 04:19:41,030
Why is he all the way over there?

7274
04:19:42,030 --> 04:19:42,950
I think it's too far.

7275
04:19:42,990 --> 04:19:44,970
I don't think he wants to play with us.

7276
04:19:44,970 --> 04:19:45,570
No.

7277
04:19:47,150 --> 04:19:47,690
What is that?

7278
04:19:48,370 --> 04:19:50,810
Was that ambiance or was that an Enderman?

7279
04:19:50,990 --> 04:19:51,190
What?

7280
04:19:51,750 --> 04:19:53,010
I don't see any near us.

7281
04:19:54,230 --> 04:19:57,450
We should just move on from here and see if we can find a fortress.

7282
04:19:58,410 --> 04:19:59,910
But we need the Enderpearls.

7283
04:19:59,910 --> 04:20:02,330
Yeah, but we're gonna find more Endermans later!

7284
04:20:03,110 --> 04:20:04,350
We have 4 out of 12.

7285
04:20:05,490 --> 04:20:07,890
The fortress is the more harder...

7286
04:20:07,890 --> 04:20:10,950
Like, if we survive the fortress, then it's fine.

7287
04:20:11,730 --> 04:20:14,170
Like, if we spend all our time trying to get...

7288
04:20:14,170 --> 04:20:14,510
Look!

7289
04:20:14,810 --> 04:20:20,710
I think we need to leave and get the fire potions before we go to the fortress.

7290
04:20:27,670 --> 04:20:31,830
I think that's our best plan of action.

7291
04:20:32,070 --> 04:20:36,910
No, you're 100% right there.

7292
04:20:38,330 --> 04:20:40,470
I thought about it, I was like...

7293
04:20:40,470 --> 04:20:42,170
No, I think we're gonna fall into...

7294
04:20:42,170 --> 04:20:43,830
I think we're gonna fall in that lava.

7295
04:20:44,130 --> 04:20:45,690
Wait, what do we need for fire potions?

7296
04:20:46,590 --> 04:20:48,910
We need the magma cubes, but...

7297
04:20:48,910 --> 04:20:50,530
We might be able to, like...

7298
04:20:50,530 --> 04:20:51,830
We can leave that.

7299
04:20:52,330 --> 04:20:54,690
Wait, but how do we find the magma cubes?

7300
04:20:55,350 --> 04:20:56,510
Oh my God, there's a ghast.

7301
04:20:56,610 --> 04:20:56,970
Be careful.

7302
04:20:57,990 --> 04:20:58,770
I'm gonna deflect him.

7303
04:20:58,930 --> 04:20:59,490
Watch this.

7304
04:20:59,630 --> 04:21:00,290
Okay, do it.

7305
04:21:00,710 --> 04:21:01,570
I'm gonna watch this.

7306
04:21:03,430 --> 04:21:06,630
But if he hits you and, like, you don't deflect...

7307
04:21:06,630 --> 04:21:08,690
And, like, it explodes around you...

7308
04:21:08,690 --> 04:21:10,150
You might fall into the lava.

7309
04:21:10,150 --> 04:21:12,250
I won't watch this.

7310
04:21:12,510 --> 04:21:13,330
Do it.

7311
04:21:16,330 --> 04:21:17,370
Okay, um...

7312
04:21:19,430 --> 04:21:21,350
I thought you said just hit it!

7313
04:21:21,770 --> 04:21:22,310
You do!

7314
04:21:22,970 --> 04:21:24,230
I don't think so.

7315
04:21:25,970 --> 04:21:27,730
Okay, why don't we stand together...

7316
04:21:27,730 --> 04:21:28,730
And maybe one of us will hit it.

7317
04:21:29,530 --> 04:21:31,150
I don't wanna try that.

7318
04:21:32,210 --> 04:21:33,370
I wanna go.

7319
04:21:34,970 --> 04:21:35,770
You know what?

7320
04:21:35,930 --> 04:21:37,010
I think I can do it.

7321
04:21:37,010 --> 04:21:38,350
Just trade with the pigs?

7322
04:21:38,450 --> 04:21:40,190
Oh wait, I actually still have more gold.

7323
04:21:40,390 --> 04:21:41,090
Wait, I do too.

7324
04:21:41,650 --> 04:21:43,010
I can craft...

7325
04:21:47,570 --> 04:21:48,790
I'm gonna craft my gold.

7326
04:21:49,710 --> 04:21:50,350
Oh yeah, here.

7327
04:21:50,570 --> 04:21:51,410
I have 50.

7328
04:21:51,610 --> 04:21:52,410
Take these.

7329
04:21:52,710 --> 04:21:53,490
Yeah, I have some too.

7330
04:21:53,530 --> 04:21:54,310
I'm crafting too.

7331
04:21:54,570 --> 04:21:55,190
What did he give me?

7332
04:21:56,410 --> 04:21:57,150
I don't even know.

7333
04:21:57,170 --> 04:21:58,190
Oh, I think he gave me soul sand.

7334
04:22:00,950 --> 04:22:01,830
Here, take that.

7335
04:22:03,290 --> 04:22:03,650
Mister.

7336
04:22:03,650 --> 04:22:03,750
Mister.

7337
04:22:04,270 --> 04:22:04,530
Mister.

7338
04:22:11,550 --> 04:22:12,070
Blackstone.

7339
04:22:13,830 --> 04:22:14,870
I'm crafting.

7340
04:22:19,070 --> 04:22:20,470
Wait, did he steal the nuggets?

7341
04:22:20,790 --> 04:22:21,970
No, I got them.

7342
04:22:22,190 --> 04:22:24,070
Alright, gotcha time!

7343
04:22:24,610 --> 04:22:26,630
Wait, why didn't he...

7344
04:22:26,630 --> 04:22:27,990
He didn't give me anything.

7345
04:22:28,130 --> 04:22:29,730
Did I take it?

7346
04:22:29,870 --> 04:22:30,510
I don't know.

7347
04:22:30,510 --> 04:22:32,350
I don't know what I have in here.

7348
04:22:35,130 --> 04:22:36,170
Oh, I don't know.

7349
04:22:36,350 --> 04:22:37,030
I don't think it was that.

7350
04:22:37,790 --> 04:22:38,970
Okay, he's giving me gravel.

7351
04:22:40,190 --> 04:22:42,150
He's giving me fucking gravel.

7352
04:22:43,890 --> 04:22:44,690
Oh wait, wait, wait.

7353
04:22:44,810 --> 04:22:46,890
I got soul speed 3.

7354
04:22:46,970 --> 04:22:49,230
What the fuck am I gonna do with soul speed 3?

7355
04:22:49,810 --> 04:22:50,870
Yeah, he gave me that too.

7356
04:22:51,890 --> 04:22:52,510
This sucks.

7357
04:22:52,750 --> 04:22:54,170
Hey, throw them over here, mister.

7358
04:22:54,330 --> 04:22:55,170
Don't look that way.

7359
04:22:55,870 --> 04:22:57,730
Oh my god, I hear another guy.

7360
04:22:57,730 --> 04:22:59,910
He gave me more...

7361
04:23:00,810 --> 04:23:01,330
Oh shit!

7362
04:23:06,240 --> 04:23:07,500
Oh, you did it!

7363
04:23:07,900 --> 04:23:09,620
Was that cool or not?

7364
04:23:10,140 --> 04:23:11,440
That was pretty cool.

7365
04:23:11,680 --> 04:23:12,700
I can do it again.

7366
04:23:13,060 --> 04:23:14,040
Hold on, there's two of them.

7367
04:23:14,660 --> 04:23:15,600
Do it!

7368
04:23:17,280 --> 04:23:17,960
Do it!

7369
04:23:19,840 --> 04:23:20,900
Yeah, that's fucking right.

7370
04:23:21,020 --> 04:23:21,760
Oh, he can't aim.

7371
04:23:22,140 --> 04:23:23,100
He can't aim.

7372
04:23:26,820 --> 04:23:27,860
Oh, he's aiming at you.

7373
04:23:27,860 --> 04:23:28,700
That means I can gotcha.

7374
04:23:30,960 --> 04:23:31,880
What if I try?

7375
04:23:32,180 --> 04:23:32,820
I'm gonna gotcha.

7376
04:23:32,980 --> 04:23:33,440
Did you hit it?

7377
04:23:34,000 --> 04:23:35,200
Only you hit it.

7378
04:23:35,460 --> 04:23:36,140
I didn't.

7379
04:23:36,560 --> 04:23:39,120
What did he give me?

7380
04:23:39,740 --> 04:23:40,560
What did he give me?

7381
04:23:41,520 --> 04:23:42,460
Unless I can't see.

7382
04:23:43,500 --> 04:23:44,940
This is like all destroyed.

7383
04:23:45,980 --> 04:23:46,420
What is that?

7384
04:23:46,480 --> 04:23:47,580
Oh, it's iron nuggets.

7385
04:23:47,960 --> 04:23:49,160
I guess that's fine.

7386
04:23:49,920 --> 04:23:50,560
That's fine.

7387
04:23:52,480 --> 04:23:54,520
Oh wait, is that netherite bricks?

7388
04:23:55,760 --> 04:23:57,500
No, is it iron bricks?

7389
04:23:57,960 --> 04:23:58,520
Or the...

7390
04:23:59,780 --> 04:24:00,620
Just the...

7391
04:24:00,620 --> 04:24:01,240
What is that?

7392
04:24:01,880 --> 04:24:02,900
Oh, it's nether brick!

7393
04:24:03,020 --> 04:24:04,040
Wait, that's good!

7394
04:24:04,440 --> 04:24:05,780
Wait, he actually gave you nether brick?

7395
04:24:05,880 --> 04:24:06,300
Yeah!

7396
04:24:06,720 --> 04:24:08,280
Oh, I hit him big!

7397
04:24:08,540 --> 04:24:09,220
I gotcha!

7398
04:24:10,900 --> 04:24:12,120
Isn't nether bricks good?

7399
04:24:13,300 --> 04:24:14,140
Yeah, there's a...

7400
04:24:14,140 --> 04:24:15,500
That's what you need to make the netherite.

7401
04:24:15,680 --> 04:24:16,940
Yeah, isn't it?

7402
04:24:17,840 --> 04:24:18,820
Oh, no it's not.

7403
04:24:18,840 --> 04:24:19,640
You're fucking with me.

7404
04:24:20,280 --> 04:24:20,800
Oh, it's not.

7405
04:24:20,940 --> 04:24:21,980
It's nether brick.

7406
04:24:22,680 --> 04:24:23,140
Oh...

7407
04:24:23,140 --> 04:24:24,940
I thought you meant it was netherite brick.

7408
04:24:25,180 --> 04:24:26,940
Oh, I thought it was nether...

7409
04:24:26,940 --> 04:24:29,640
I thought that meant netherite.

7410
04:24:29,800 --> 04:24:31,360
Because it says nether in it.

7411
04:24:31,720 --> 04:24:33,560
So I was like, oh, that's cool.

7412
04:24:38,060 --> 04:24:39,500
You wanna find another guy?

7413
04:24:40,140 --> 04:24:40,540
Yeah.

7414
04:24:41,600 --> 04:24:44,560
His payout, his gotcha rates were a little too high.

7415
04:24:44,860 --> 04:24:45,800
A little too low.

7416
04:24:46,260 --> 04:24:46,960
A little too low.

7417
04:24:48,340 --> 04:24:50,480
It was like 0.01%.

7418
04:24:50,480 --> 04:24:50,960
Hey, hey, hey!

7419
04:24:51,780 --> 04:24:53,080
Yeah, that's right.

7420
04:24:53,140 --> 04:24:53,820
Come down here.

7421
04:24:55,500 --> 04:24:56,040
Go buy gravel.

7422
04:24:57,440 --> 04:24:58,480
Yeah, work for us.

7423
04:24:59,560 --> 04:25:00,040
Here.

7424
04:25:01,480 --> 04:25:02,620
Go, take the gold.

7425
04:25:02,900 --> 04:25:03,240
Yeah, take that.

7426
04:25:03,300 --> 04:25:03,860
Take that gold.

7427
04:25:08,750 --> 04:25:09,870
What did he give me?

7428
04:25:10,670 --> 04:25:11,910
Sometimes I don't know.

7429
04:25:12,490 --> 04:25:12,870
I know.

7430
04:25:13,970 --> 04:25:15,430
Sometimes I can't tell what I'm already doing.

7431
04:25:15,430 --> 04:25:16,230
That's gravel?

7432
04:25:16,550 --> 04:25:17,310
That's gravel?

7433
04:25:17,490 --> 04:25:18,270
I don't want that.

7434
04:25:18,750 --> 04:25:20,030
Oh, I got the nether brick.

7435
04:25:20,550 --> 04:25:22,430
Yeah, that's the one I threw away.

7436
04:25:22,910 --> 04:25:23,270
Yeah.

7437
04:25:23,910 --> 04:25:26,130
I got more gold here though.

7438
04:25:26,270 --> 04:25:26,750
Gold nuggets.

7439
04:25:27,810 --> 04:25:28,710
Oh, don't do it in front of him.

7440
04:25:28,830 --> 04:25:29,470
Don't do it in front of him.

7441
04:25:29,510 --> 04:25:29,950
He'll get angry.

7442
04:25:30,150 --> 04:25:30,690
No, he didn't.

7443
04:25:30,750 --> 04:25:31,590
He didn't look.

7444
04:25:31,750 --> 04:25:34,030
Oh, I think it's because he's busy with the...

7445
04:25:34,750 --> 04:25:36,690
Yeah, as long as I throw it...

7446
04:25:36,690 --> 04:25:38,030
in front of...

7447
04:25:39,370 --> 04:25:40,190
Alright, come on.

7448
04:25:42,630 --> 04:25:43,350
Come on.

7449
04:25:44,490 --> 04:25:46,210
I wanna kill him so bad.

7450
04:25:46,210 --> 04:25:49,290
Oh, I got...

7451
04:25:49,290 --> 04:25:50,170
Oh, I got fire resistance!

7452
04:25:51,170 --> 04:25:52,190
I got fire resistance!

7453
04:25:52,830 --> 04:25:53,210
Nice!

7454
04:25:53,990 --> 04:25:54,710
What did he give you?

7455
04:25:59,960 --> 04:26:01,160
It's more gravel.

7456
04:26:02,200 --> 04:26:03,580
Alright, we got fire resistance.

7457
04:26:05,000 --> 04:26:06,320
Alright, let's head back.

7458
04:26:07,060 --> 04:26:07,520
Okay, yeah.

7459
04:26:08,040 --> 04:26:09,800
So, we need to kill magma cubes, but how...

7460
04:26:09,800 --> 04:26:11,200
We can't kill them though.

7461
04:26:11,580 --> 04:26:14,140
We need to find magma cubes for more fire resistance.

7462
04:26:14,460 --> 04:26:15,920
Unless we find for more gold.

7463
04:26:16,940 --> 04:26:18,540
And just keep gacha-ing.

7464
04:26:19,120 --> 04:26:20,240
Can we just keep gacha?

7465
04:26:20,760 --> 04:26:22,080
That might be an option, yeah.

7466
04:26:22,260 --> 04:26:24,700
Because I feel like magma cubes are harder...

7467
04:26:24,700 --> 04:26:25,580
for fire resistance.

7468
04:26:26,540 --> 04:26:28,200
For where we spawned in?

7469
04:26:28,240 --> 04:26:28,760
Yeah, maybe.

7470
04:26:30,620 --> 04:26:31,180
Alright.

7471
04:26:32,660 --> 04:26:33,920
It's time to just gacha.

7472
04:26:35,380 --> 04:26:36,820
I love gacha.

7473
04:26:37,280 --> 04:26:38,420
I love gacha.

7474
04:26:38,540 --> 04:26:40,320
I love...

7475
04:26:40,320 --> 04:26:41,580
Wait, where did I leave my chest?

7476
04:26:42,140 --> 04:26:43,360
Oh, over here.

7477
04:26:43,360 --> 04:26:43,400
Over here.

7478
04:26:47,920 --> 04:26:49,080
I love...

7479
04:26:49,080 --> 04:26:49,760
gacha.

7480
04:26:55,000 --> 04:26:57,080
I threw away my mushrooms.

7481
04:26:59,740 --> 04:27:02,920
Wait, why did you throw away your mushrooms?

7482
04:27:03,400 --> 04:27:05,560
Because I didn't know we needed anymore.

7483
04:27:07,100 --> 04:27:08,400
We need them!

7484
04:27:08,500 --> 04:27:09,300
Okay, I'll go back in.

7485
04:27:10,080 --> 04:27:11,060
It's right there.

7486
04:27:11,060 --> 04:27:12,080
It's right there.

7487
04:27:12,160 --> 04:27:12,840
I'll go in.

7488
04:27:13,360 --> 04:27:16,560
It's right there.

7489
04:27:17,080 --> 04:27:18,020
I'll go in.

7490
04:27:18,080 --> 04:27:22,320
I might be able to kill some more endermen on the way.

7491
04:27:23,460 --> 04:27:24,120
Like that guy.

7492
04:27:24,360 --> 04:27:24,680
Come here.

7493
04:27:26,380 --> 04:27:28,660
Wait, did you get trapped down there?

7494
04:27:28,820 --> 04:27:29,620
Oh no, he's not.

7495
04:27:29,720 --> 04:27:32,700
I'm just throwing away stuff right now.

7496
04:27:35,300 --> 04:27:37,200
We don't need obsidian anymore, right?

7497
04:27:38,520 --> 04:27:39,500
I don't think so.

7498
04:27:39,500 --> 04:27:40,940
Okay, goodbye obsidian.

7499
04:27:41,360 --> 04:27:42,520
Wait, chat.

7500
04:27:42,900 --> 04:27:44,360
We don't need obsidian anymore, right?

7501
04:27:44,920 --> 04:27:46,660
I don't know why I asked you.

7502
04:27:49,760 --> 04:27:54,620
Oh my gosh, I'm not doing very well.

7503
04:27:54,680 --> 04:27:55,880
Oh, enchanting tables.

7504
04:27:56,160 --> 04:27:58,460
Wait, we need a chanting table for obsidian?

7505
04:27:59,660 --> 04:28:00,940
Oh yeah, that's true.

7506
04:28:01,540 --> 04:28:05,780
I knew I should listen to chat was a good idea.

7507
04:28:06,320 --> 04:28:07,620
I can't English anymore.

7508
04:28:07,620 --> 04:28:12,280
Every single enderman I've killed has not dropped anything!

7509
04:28:12,880 --> 04:28:14,060
I can't English anymore.

7510
04:28:14,640 --> 04:28:17,640
My mind is mush right now.

7511
04:28:19,820 --> 04:28:20,420
Alright.

7512
04:28:20,420 --> 04:28:21,680
Alright, Pikki.

7513
04:28:21,900 --> 04:28:22,320
It's time.

7514
04:28:22,460 --> 04:28:23,160
Let's go gambling!

7515
04:28:24,500 --> 04:28:25,620
Let's go gambling!

7516
04:28:27,480 --> 04:28:29,000
I don't know where it's at.

7517
04:28:29,740 --> 04:28:30,960
Let's go gambling!

7518
04:28:31,380 --> 04:28:31,980
Where?

7519
04:28:32,080 --> 04:28:32,320
Where?

7520
04:28:32,440 --> 04:28:32,560
Where?

7521
04:28:32,580 --> 04:28:35,260
I don't do this to me.

7522
04:28:36,200 --> 04:28:37,400
Why are you still pondering?

7523
04:28:38,340 --> 04:28:39,800
Oh my god, he's right there!

7524
04:28:39,880 --> 04:28:40,560
Are you kidding me?

7525
04:28:41,780 --> 04:28:42,920
Grab the gold.

7526
04:28:43,460 --> 04:28:44,700
Oh, what the fuck?

7527
04:28:44,780 --> 04:28:49,120
Oh my god, he just fucking keeled over in front of me.

7528
04:28:49,800 --> 04:28:51,100
I kill him.

7529
04:28:53,680 --> 04:28:56,260
We need soul sand because I'm throwing away soul sand.

7530
04:28:57,100 --> 04:28:58,160
I don't think so.

7531
04:28:58,320 --> 04:28:58,900
Do we, guys?

7532
04:28:59,700 --> 04:29:00,200
It's too late.

7533
04:29:00,320 --> 04:29:00,660
It's gone.

7534
04:29:01,660 --> 04:29:02,520
It's gone.

7535
04:29:02,520 --> 04:29:04,520
I hate... I hate...

7536
04:29:05,860 --> 04:29:07,060
Goodbye, gravel.

7537
04:29:07,740 --> 04:29:08,240
I hate ghasts.

7538
04:29:08,680 --> 04:29:09,520
I hate them.

7539
04:29:10,680 --> 04:29:10,920
Goodbye.

7540
04:29:11,900 --> 04:29:14,860
He gave me two stacks of gravel?!

7541
04:29:14,860 --> 04:29:16,320
This fucking bitch!

7542
04:29:18,660 --> 04:29:19,260
He sucks.

7543
04:29:19,360 --> 04:29:19,860
He sucks.

7544
04:29:24,480 --> 04:29:26,200
Oh, I'm out of space.

7545
04:29:26,420 --> 04:29:26,640
No!

7546
04:29:26,940 --> 04:29:27,380
Oh, okay.

7547
04:29:27,760 --> 04:29:28,140
There we go.

7548
04:29:28,760 --> 04:29:31,120
What if I just take this gold in front of you?

7549
04:29:32,520 --> 04:29:32,860
Come here.

7550
04:29:32,880 --> 04:29:33,040
Come here.

7551
04:29:33,140 --> 04:29:33,220
Come here.

7552
04:29:33,420 --> 04:29:35,040
I'm so sorry.

7553
04:29:35,100 --> 04:29:35,760
I'm so sorry.

7554
04:29:35,860 --> 04:29:36,580
I'm so sorry.

7555
04:29:36,700 --> 04:29:37,460
I'm so sorry.

7556
04:29:37,680 --> 04:29:39,240
Oh my god, you do get mad.

7557
04:29:39,600 --> 04:29:42,560
You do get mad when you take gold in front of them.

7558
04:29:42,580 --> 04:29:43,540
I told you!

7559
04:29:43,780 --> 04:29:46,280
I know, but I didn't believe you!

7560
04:29:46,620 --> 04:29:48,940
Oh my god, they're all gonna keep attacking us now.

7561
04:29:49,460 --> 04:29:49,860
No!

7562
04:29:51,500 --> 04:29:52,960
Just this one guy.

7563
04:29:54,400 --> 04:29:54,800
See?

7564
04:29:55,140 --> 04:29:57,620
I think if you kill them in front or not in front of other guys...

7565
04:29:57,620 --> 04:29:58,380
No, I didn't touch him.

7566
04:29:58,440 --> 04:29:59,260
I didn't touch him.

7567
04:29:59,260 --> 04:30:00,240
Okay, okay.

7568
04:30:00,360 --> 04:30:01,180
We should be good then.

7569
04:30:02,200 --> 04:30:04,600
I called your bluff and I was wrong.

7570
04:30:06,340 --> 04:30:07,620
Why would I be wrong?

7571
04:30:08,020 --> 04:30:08,860
I don't know.

7572
04:30:09,920 --> 04:30:11,140
Sometimes you're wrong.

7573
04:30:12,360 --> 04:30:12,920
Sometimes you're wrong.

7574
04:30:13,220 --> 04:30:14,580
That's a lie right there.

7575
04:30:17,700 --> 04:30:19,140
Okay, I have one more gotcha.

7576
04:30:19,320 --> 04:30:20,000
Oh wait, these are the wrong ones.

7577
04:30:20,140 --> 04:30:21,580
Okay, I need...

7578
04:30:21,580 --> 04:30:21,980
It's these guys?

7579
04:30:22,720 --> 04:30:24,800
Actually, it doesn't hurt to have more of them, I suppose.

7580
04:30:25,220 --> 04:30:26,620
Let's go gambling.

7581
04:30:27,180 --> 04:30:28,240
Let's go gambling.

7582
04:30:28,480 --> 04:30:29,960
Let's go gambling.

7583
04:30:32,000 --> 04:30:35,640
Okay, I'm gonna give it to that one guy that didn't like me.

7584
04:30:35,760 --> 04:30:36,680
Because I'm gonna bribe him.

7585
04:30:36,940 --> 04:30:37,780
So he'll like me.

7586
04:30:38,320 --> 04:30:38,780
Yeah, yeah.

7587
04:30:39,180 --> 04:30:39,960
Alright, here you go.

7588
04:30:40,040 --> 04:30:40,960
Do you like me now?

7589
04:30:42,740 --> 04:30:43,180
See?

7590
04:30:43,240 --> 04:30:44,280
He likes me now.

7591
04:30:44,440 --> 04:30:45,500
I see a magma cube.

7592
04:30:48,920 --> 04:30:50,040
I can get down there.

7593
04:30:50,500 --> 04:30:51,600
Oh no, he stopped.

7594
04:30:52,020 --> 04:30:53,300
Oh no, I'm sorry.

7595
04:30:53,380 --> 04:30:54,180
I'm so sorry.

7596
04:30:54,180 --> 04:30:55,360
I didn't know.

7597
04:30:55,540 --> 04:30:56,920
I knew I did it again.

7598
04:30:57,000 --> 04:30:57,780
I did it again.

7599
04:30:57,860 --> 04:30:58,800
I did it again.

7600
04:30:59,520 --> 04:31:00,940
I went gambling.

7601
04:31:02,820 --> 04:31:03,680
I'm sorry.

7602
04:31:03,780 --> 04:31:04,580
With your life.

7603
04:31:05,580 --> 04:31:06,580
Gambling with your life.

7604
04:31:06,620 --> 04:31:07,820
Oh, I got an enderpearl.

7605
04:31:08,160 --> 04:31:08,500
Yay!

7606
04:31:10,380 --> 04:31:12,080
I don't know why I keep gambling.

7607
04:31:12,700 --> 04:31:13,860
I have a problem.

7608
04:31:14,600 --> 04:31:15,520
I have a problem.

7609
04:31:16,840 --> 04:31:18,080
Okay, there's a bunch of...

7610
04:31:18,080 --> 04:31:19,700
little endermen around here now, so...

7611
04:31:20,440 --> 04:31:22,040
I'll keep getting them.

7612
04:31:22,040 --> 04:31:23,660
Okay, while you keep doing that, I'm gonna keep gambling.

7613
04:31:24,320 --> 04:31:25,460
Okay, I have some more gold.

7614
04:31:25,480 --> 04:31:26,580
I have a problem now.

7615
04:31:30,100 --> 04:31:31,100
I have enough.

7616
04:31:33,160 --> 04:31:34,220
Come here, come here.

7617
04:31:34,380 --> 04:31:34,640
You too.

7618
04:31:35,460 --> 04:31:36,120
Both of you.

7619
04:31:37,760 --> 04:31:38,420
Oh no!

7620
04:31:40,120 --> 04:31:41,040
Wait, what happened?

7621
04:31:41,580 --> 04:31:44,040
I knocked the enderman off the side...

7622
04:31:44,040 --> 04:31:46,000
and I think you fell into the lava.

7623
04:31:46,400 --> 04:31:47,060
You did this.

7624
04:31:47,140 --> 04:31:48,620
You killed somebody today.

7625
04:31:49,400 --> 04:31:50,720
Wait, it says enderman screams.

7626
04:31:50,840 --> 04:31:51,800
He's still around somewhere.

7627
04:31:52,520 --> 04:31:53,120
Okay.

7628
04:31:53,280 --> 04:31:53,540
Enderman?

7629
04:31:55,160 --> 04:31:56,340
Let's go gambling.

7630
04:31:57,080 --> 04:31:57,680
Enderman?

7631
04:31:58,160 --> 04:31:59,100
Let's go gambling.

7632
04:31:59,520 --> 04:32:01,700
Oh, he's down there yelling at me.

7633
04:32:02,220 --> 04:32:02,700
Oh my God.

7634
04:32:03,360 --> 04:32:05,140
He knows what you did last summer.

7635
04:32:05,700 --> 04:32:06,980
He knows what you did last summer.

7636
04:32:08,080 --> 04:32:10,140
I got a magma charge.

7637
04:32:12,520 --> 04:32:14,240
Come on, what else do you have?

7638
04:32:15,080 --> 04:32:15,800
I have...

7639
04:32:15,800 --> 04:32:17,640
Oh, it teleports before it hits lava.

7640
04:32:18,820 --> 04:32:19,600
That's what they said.

7641
04:32:19,600 --> 04:32:21,500
Okay, well come here.

7642
04:32:21,880 --> 04:32:23,300
I have one more gold piece.

7643
04:32:24,200 --> 04:32:25,540
Come on, I know you're rich.

7644
04:32:25,640 --> 04:32:26,780
I see what you're wearing.

7645
04:32:27,200 --> 04:32:28,680
I know you have the money.

7646
04:32:29,580 --> 04:32:30,280
Don't be...

7647
04:32:30,280 --> 04:32:32,140
Don't be holding out on me.

7648
04:32:32,240 --> 04:32:34,240
God damn it, he gave me fucking leather.

7649
04:32:34,840 --> 04:32:35,940
He held out on me.

7650
04:32:36,260 --> 04:32:38,060
Both of our gotcha luck is so bad.

7651
04:32:38,380 --> 04:32:42,020
Well, I did get fire resistance, so...

7652
04:32:42,020 --> 04:32:42,700
I don't know.

7653
04:32:43,480 --> 04:32:44,920
I got one pearl.

7654
04:32:45,140 --> 04:32:46,060
Here, I'm gonna give it to you.

7655
04:32:47,240 --> 04:32:48,300
Hold on to it.

7656
04:32:48,460 --> 04:32:48,960
Where are you?

7657
04:32:49,180 --> 04:32:50,680
Okay, we have five now.

7658
04:32:51,360 --> 04:32:51,820
Yeah.

7659
04:32:53,060 --> 04:32:54,340
Five out of how many?

7660
04:32:55,620 --> 04:32:57,460
Oh wait, I can use the leather to make books.

7661
04:32:57,660 --> 04:32:59,040
Oh, we don't need books.

7662
04:32:59,540 --> 04:33:03,080
Guys, we can just get it by farming the...

7663
04:33:03,080 --> 04:33:03,980
the fortress.

7664
04:33:04,480 --> 04:33:05,840
The big fortress.

7665
04:33:06,580 --> 04:33:07,660
What are you talking about?

7666
04:33:07,980 --> 04:33:10,020
They're saying we need books for enchanting table.

7667
04:33:10,160 --> 04:33:11,260
But we don't need it.

7668
04:33:11,820 --> 04:33:13,220
Actually, we kinda do.

7669
04:33:13,220 --> 04:33:15,600
Okay, well, I dropped like seven stacks of...

7670
04:33:15,600 --> 04:33:17,620
I think like a stack of leather.

7671
04:33:18,640 --> 04:33:19,420
Into the...

7672
04:33:19,420 --> 04:33:21,060
Into the flames.

7673
04:33:21,560 --> 04:33:22,520
So, we don't anymore.

7674
04:33:23,080 --> 04:33:25,280
We don't need them anymore.

7675
04:33:25,760 --> 04:33:26,600
I got another enderman.

7676
04:33:27,060 --> 04:33:27,920
I baited you.

7677
04:33:28,260 --> 04:33:29,760
I baited you into my trap.

7678
04:33:30,120 --> 04:33:31,320
Why did you have to fall?

7679
04:33:32,740 --> 04:33:33,980
Goodbye, soul sand.

7680
04:33:34,960 --> 04:33:36,060
Goodbye, soul sand.

7681
04:33:36,100 --> 04:33:37,080
I don't need you.

7682
04:33:39,260 --> 04:33:39,800
Let's see.

7683
04:33:39,800 --> 04:33:40,580
Stronghold library?

7684
04:33:40,920 --> 04:33:41,380
Oh, yeah.

7685
04:33:41,480 --> 04:33:42,560
That's what I mean.

7686
04:33:42,860 --> 04:33:45,920
We'll get the books from the stronghold.

7687
04:33:46,200 --> 04:33:46,440
True.

7688
04:33:47,420 --> 04:33:49,360
We don't need the leather for it.

7689
04:33:49,660 --> 04:33:50,880
Strongholds are not scary.

7690
04:33:51,360 --> 04:33:52,820
How long is your potion for?

7691
04:33:53,260 --> 04:33:53,900
Three minutes.

7692
04:33:55,460 --> 04:33:57,060
That should be enough.

7693
04:33:58,000 --> 04:33:59,380
Well, we still need...

7694
04:33:59,380 --> 04:34:02,280
What do we need for the slow falling, everybody?

7695
04:34:02,600 --> 04:34:04,760
What do we need for the slow falling?

7696
04:34:04,760 --> 04:34:04,960
Slow falling.

7697
04:34:09,440 --> 04:34:10,520
Oh, that guy disappeared.

7698
04:34:10,880 --> 04:34:11,320
For real.

7699
04:34:11,460 --> 04:34:12,080
What happened to him?

7700
04:34:13,580 --> 04:34:15,100
He gave me leather bricks again.

7701
04:34:17,040 --> 04:34:17,960
Oh, phantom!

7702
04:34:18,780 --> 04:34:20,580
Okay, so we have to not sleep.

7703
04:34:20,740 --> 04:34:21,500
Oh, okay.

7704
04:34:21,740 --> 04:34:22,180
That's fine.

7705
04:34:22,680 --> 04:34:23,540
Yeah, that's fine.

7706
04:34:24,220 --> 04:34:26,000
And we stay up for the enderman too.

7707
04:34:26,280 --> 04:34:28,060
Maybe we'll buy more enderman.

7708
04:34:28,720 --> 04:34:29,320
Maybe, yeah.

7709
04:34:29,540 --> 04:34:32,200
Or we die by skelly or creeper.

7710
04:34:32,300 --> 04:34:33,560
There's no way we die.

7711
04:34:33,560 --> 04:34:35,180
We have like...

7712
04:34:35,180 --> 04:34:36,940
We're full diamond...

7713
04:34:37,460 --> 04:34:38,680
We're full diamond...

7714
04:34:38,680 --> 04:34:39,980
Sorry, my brain is not working.

7715
04:34:40,320 --> 04:34:41,240
We're full diamond armor.

7716
04:34:43,200 --> 04:34:44,220
I'm not okay.

7717
04:34:44,740 --> 04:34:45,860
You're losing it.

7718
04:34:47,320 --> 04:34:48,680
I'm fucking losing it.

7719
04:34:48,700 --> 04:34:50,020
I'm gonna jump into the lava.

7720
04:34:50,260 --> 04:34:51,220
Someone stop me.

7721
04:34:51,280 --> 04:34:52,480
I'm fucking heading straight to the lava.

7722
04:34:52,640 --> 04:34:54,060
I'm gonna take the jump.

7723
04:34:55,160 --> 04:34:56,440
I'm gonna take the jump!

7724
04:34:56,740 --> 04:34:57,440
Don't do it!

7725
04:34:57,880 --> 04:34:58,360
Enderman!

7726
04:34:58,360 --> 04:34:58,740
Enderman!

7727
04:34:58,840 --> 04:34:59,860
For us!

7728
04:35:02,660 --> 04:35:03,560
And we're done.

7729
04:35:03,640 --> 04:35:04,720
It's over again!

7730
04:35:05,020 --> 04:35:10,640
Why can't I get any pearls?

7731
04:35:11,160 --> 04:35:12,340
How do we get home?

7732
04:35:12,840 --> 04:35:13,960
There's no pearls here.

7733
04:35:16,420 --> 04:35:18,120
Guys, why is my luck so bad?

7734
04:35:19,700 --> 04:35:21,200
This is why I don't gamba.

7735
04:35:21,720 --> 04:35:22,700
Let's go gambling.

7736
04:35:24,620 --> 04:35:25,920
Okay, I'm okay, guys.

7737
04:35:25,920 --> 04:35:27,200
It's been four...

7738
04:35:27,200 --> 04:35:28,080
Okay, five hours.

7739
04:35:28,280 --> 04:35:30,940
That's five hours too many for Minecraft.

7740
04:35:37,240 --> 04:35:38,820
What do you want me to do?

7741
04:35:38,880 --> 04:35:40,100
I'm waiting for you right now.

7742
04:35:41,020 --> 04:35:43,560
I'm waiting for this Enderman to come get me.

7743
04:35:43,660 --> 04:35:44,680
Alright, I'm heading over.

7744
04:35:46,020 --> 04:35:47,020
I'll help you.

7745
04:35:48,220 --> 04:35:50,640
All in all, this isn't the worst spawn, I suppose.

7746
04:35:51,200 --> 04:35:52,140
Come up here, buddy.

7747
04:35:52,140 --> 04:35:53,620
Come up here.

7748
04:35:54,580 --> 04:35:55,580
He's fallen.

7749
04:35:57,700 --> 04:35:58,260
Where is he?

7750
04:35:58,880 --> 04:35:59,780
He's down there.

7751
04:35:59,920 --> 04:36:00,760
What are you looking at?

7752
04:36:01,200 --> 04:36:02,300
He's down here.

7753
04:36:02,440 --> 04:36:02,800
Where?

7754
04:36:03,840 --> 04:36:05,260
Literally down here.

7755
04:36:06,300 --> 04:36:07,640
Oh my god.

7756
04:36:08,000 --> 04:36:12,240
I swear if he comes back up and smacks me into this lava pool...

7757
04:36:12,240 --> 04:36:13,820
No, he's aggroed on me.

7758
04:36:14,300 --> 04:36:15,560
I'm looking at him too.

7759
04:36:17,740 --> 04:36:19,020
Just use your arrow.

7760
04:36:20,120 --> 04:36:21,060
He'll dodge it.

7761
04:36:21,200 --> 04:36:23,500
You can't shoot an Enderman with an arrow.

7762
04:36:23,760 --> 04:36:24,960
I'm not gonna waste my arrow.

7763
04:36:25,320 --> 04:36:25,920
You don't know that.

7764
04:36:26,040 --> 04:36:27,980
How do you know that?

7765
04:36:29,200 --> 04:36:30,240
I've done it before.

7766
04:36:30,760 --> 04:36:32,680
Maybe it's just that one guy.

7767
04:36:34,620 --> 04:36:35,940
He'll dodge and TP up.

7768
04:36:37,220 --> 04:36:38,680
Yeah, do it.

7769
04:36:39,340 --> 04:36:40,160
Just TP up.

7770
04:36:41,640 --> 04:36:42,100
What?

7771
04:36:42,440 --> 04:36:42,700
Up?

7772
04:36:42,880 --> 04:36:44,260
Yeah, he'll dodge, but he'll TP.

7773
04:36:45,800 --> 04:36:46,200
Oh.

7774
04:36:47,440 --> 04:36:49,440
But it's a waste of a spectral arrow.

7775
04:36:49,680 --> 04:36:50,380
Oh, nevermind.

7776
04:36:50,620 --> 04:36:52,340
There you go.

7777
04:36:53,460 --> 04:36:54,560
What do you mean?

7778
04:36:54,740 --> 04:36:55,820
You were hitting me instead!

7779
04:36:56,900 --> 04:36:58,140
Yes, you were!

7780
04:36:58,580 --> 04:36:59,340
I don't get Ender Pearl.

7781
04:36:59,680 --> 04:37:00,760
You were hitting me instead!

7782
04:37:00,780 --> 04:37:04,220
It was the Enderman.

7783
04:37:05,300 --> 04:37:06,100
It was the Enderman.

7784
04:37:06,180 --> 04:37:08,220
Literally my thing was on the Enderman right here.

7785
04:37:08,300 --> 04:37:08,680
This is what I did.

7786
04:37:10,340 --> 04:37:11,320
That wasn't me.

7787
04:37:11,320 --> 04:37:12,100
That was not me.

7788
04:37:12,420 --> 04:37:15,120
That wasn't me.

7789
04:37:15,640 --> 04:37:16,780
Pull up the VOD!

7790
04:37:16,940 --> 04:37:17,900
Pull up the VOD!

7791
04:37:20,160 --> 04:37:21,440
After this stream is over!

7792
04:37:21,440 --> 04:37:22,300
We need the receipts!

7793
04:37:22,360 --> 04:37:25,660
After this stream is over, pull up the receipts right now!

7794
04:37:26,080 --> 04:37:26,780
Clip it!

7795
04:37:27,200 --> 04:37:28,520
Time stamp this moment!

7796
04:37:28,820 --> 04:37:30,080
Time stamp this moment!

7797
04:37:30,300 --> 04:37:31,480
And we'll know.

7798
04:37:32,460 --> 04:37:34,260
We'll know in 12 more hours.

7799
04:37:34,500 --> 04:37:36,400
We'll know in 12 hours.

7800
04:37:36,400 --> 04:37:41,180
We'll know in 12 hours.

7801
04:37:41,280 --> 04:37:42,240
We'll know in 12 hours if that happened.

7802
04:37:43,440 --> 04:37:44,820
How do we get back?

7803
04:37:45,740 --> 04:37:46,300
Where's home?

7804
04:37:47,160 --> 04:37:47,600
It's gotta be...

7805
04:37:47,600 --> 04:37:48,160
Okay, be careful.

7806
04:37:48,280 --> 04:37:48,820
Don't go that way.

7807
04:37:49,480 --> 04:37:50,740
It's gotta be this way.

7808
04:37:53,280 --> 04:37:53,720
Because...

7809
04:37:54,360 --> 04:37:55,600
We didn't go to the...

7810
04:37:55,600 --> 04:37:56,900
We came from the side.

7811
04:37:58,300 --> 04:38:00,680
Do you remember which side it was?

7812
04:38:00,760 --> 04:38:01,640
Because I don't.

7813
04:38:02,680 --> 04:38:04,800
I have the coordinates in case we need it.

7814
04:38:04,800 --> 04:38:08,120
I think this is the moment where we need it.

7815
04:38:08,140 --> 04:38:10,940
I remember that sand over there.

7816
04:38:11,260 --> 04:38:14,400
Why did we not put any torches to tell us where we went?

7817
04:38:15,040 --> 04:38:17,260
I did a little over...

7818
04:38:17,260 --> 04:38:17,800
Yeah?

7819
04:38:19,320 --> 04:38:20,720
There's a gas, be careful.

7820
04:38:21,540 --> 04:38:22,020
Where?

7821
04:38:22,180 --> 04:38:22,900
Oh, it's over there.

7822
04:38:23,000 --> 04:38:23,540
Oh my God!

7823
04:38:25,340 --> 04:38:26,640
No, don't say that.

7824
04:38:26,740 --> 04:38:27,620
Now I'm freaking out.

7825
04:38:27,700 --> 04:38:28,540
Now I'm panicking.

7826
04:38:28,900 --> 04:38:29,740
Now I'm panicking.

7827
04:38:30,300 --> 04:38:32,080
Now I'm panicking.

7828
04:38:32,080 --> 04:38:32,480
I'm panicking, Min.

7829
04:38:32,560 --> 04:38:34,220
I'm panicking right now.

7830
04:38:34,620 --> 04:38:35,100
I'm freaking out.

7831
04:38:37,240 --> 04:38:39,260
I'm freaking out right now, Min.

7832
04:38:39,400 --> 04:38:41,120
I don't know, I'm freaking out.

7833
04:38:41,120 --> 04:38:43,700
He's aggroed on me, you have no reason to freak out.

7834
04:38:46,100 --> 04:38:48,020
What if he looks at me?

7835
04:38:49,700 --> 04:38:51,200
Okay, I think he despawned.

7836
04:38:51,700 --> 04:38:52,600
Yeah, he definitely did.

7837
04:38:52,640 --> 04:38:54,120
He just disappeared on my screen.

7838
04:38:54,520 --> 04:38:55,060
Okay, cool.

7839
04:38:56,700 --> 04:38:58,200
Oh shit, where are we?

7840
04:39:00,680 --> 04:39:01,320
I don't know.

7841
04:39:01,320 --> 04:39:02,980
Oh, you have the coordinates.

7842
04:39:05,640 --> 04:39:06,720
Is it down here?

7843
04:39:06,980 --> 04:39:07,860
I'll get the coordinates.

7844
04:39:08,160 --> 04:39:09,120
Okay, I'll get the coordinates.

7845
04:39:10,020 --> 04:39:11,340
It's on the other side.

7846
04:39:11,380 --> 04:39:12,300
From here, I think.

7847
04:39:13,520 --> 04:39:15,260
Yeah, because it was past that lava.

7848
04:39:15,640 --> 04:39:17,120
Yeah, yeah, it was past this lava.

7849
04:39:17,780 --> 04:39:18,440
Yeah, yeah.

7850
04:39:18,760 --> 04:39:19,820
Is there any bees around here?

7851
04:39:20,740 --> 04:39:22,180
I'm mining, I'm mining.

7852
04:39:22,660 --> 04:39:24,160
I found the hole we made.

7853
04:39:25,600 --> 04:39:27,020
I'm not scouting, by the way.

7854
04:39:27,060 --> 04:39:28,400
I'm literally in our hole.

7855
04:39:31,460 --> 04:39:33,600
Alright, I'm going back to the portal.

7856
04:39:34,040 --> 04:39:34,780
Hold on.

7857
04:39:35,120 --> 04:39:36,300
I'm getting more gold.

7858
04:39:36,500 --> 04:39:37,500
This is for us.

7859
04:39:38,520 --> 04:39:39,960
I'm heading over.

7860
04:39:40,840 --> 04:39:42,320
I only got 17.

7861
04:39:43,300 --> 04:39:44,540
Oh my God, how do we...

7862
04:39:44,540 --> 04:39:46,080
How do we jump down from here?

7863
04:39:46,860 --> 04:39:47,980
How does this work?

7864
04:39:49,840 --> 04:39:51,120
I'm so...

7865
04:39:51,120 --> 04:39:51,820
I'm coming.

7866
04:39:52,940 --> 04:39:55,340
Oh, there's too many holes.

7867
04:39:57,140 --> 04:39:58,980
There's so many holes.

7868
04:40:01,800 --> 04:40:03,280
Alright, this is the right hole.

7869
04:40:03,820 --> 04:40:04,640
I'm just gonna fall.

7870
04:40:05,000 --> 04:40:05,780
I think I found it.

7871
04:40:07,360 --> 04:40:07,720
Oh.

7872
04:40:09,180 --> 04:40:11,680
If I get out of the nether and like...

7873
04:40:11,680 --> 04:40:13,120
And then I see...

7874
04:40:13,120 --> 04:40:14,780
Made Mint dies.

7875
04:40:15,600 --> 04:40:16,660
Are you out of the nether?

7876
04:40:17,220 --> 04:40:18,000
Yeah, I'm out.

7877
04:40:18,960 --> 04:40:20,960
I'm out, but it's night time and I'm gonna sleep.

7878
04:40:21,680 --> 04:40:23,380
Oh, I can't sleep, so...

7879
04:40:23,380 --> 04:40:24,000
Good luck with that.

7880
04:40:24,060 --> 04:40:26,220
You might... You actually would be safer probably in here.

7881
04:40:26,540 --> 04:40:27,200
Yeah, that's true.

7882
04:40:27,300 --> 04:40:28,320
Maybe it would be safer.

7883
04:40:28,740 --> 04:40:29,100
Maybe.

7884
04:40:29,660 --> 04:40:30,860
Until I'm out.

7885
04:40:32,100 --> 04:40:33,840
Back to the portal I go!

7886
04:40:34,900 --> 04:40:35,740
Oh shit!

7887
04:40:35,960 --> 04:40:36,320
Oh shit!

7888
04:40:36,480 --> 04:40:36,800
Oh shit!

7889
04:40:37,040 --> 04:40:37,600
Doki doki!

7890
04:40:39,240 --> 04:40:40,120
Where are you?

7891
04:40:40,360 --> 04:40:40,800
Where are you?

7892
04:40:40,800 --> 04:40:41,160
I'm okay!

7893
04:40:41,320 --> 04:40:41,940
I'm okay!

7894
04:40:42,120 --> 04:40:43,020
Where did you go?

7895
04:40:43,380 --> 04:40:43,520
Where are you?

7896
04:40:43,620 --> 04:40:45,140
Where are you, Mint?!

7897
04:40:45,140 --> 04:40:46,780
Where are you, Mint?!

7898
04:40:46,780 --> 04:40:47,500
Everything's fine!

7899
04:40:47,660 --> 04:40:49,640
That did not sound fine!

7900
04:40:50,320 --> 04:40:50,880
That's...

7901
04:40:50,880 --> 04:40:51,900
Okay!

7902
04:40:53,620 --> 04:40:54,400
I'm okay!

7903
04:40:55,000 --> 04:40:55,540
I'm okay!

7904
04:40:55,540 --> 04:40:56,640
I...

7905
04:40:57,680 --> 04:40:59,960
Things were not okay for like...

7906
04:40:59,960 --> 04:41:00,700
a good...

7907
04:41:00,700 --> 04:41:02,620
30 seconds, but I'm okay.

7908
04:41:02,840 --> 04:41:03,760
What happened?

7909
04:41:03,940 --> 04:41:04,720
What happened?

7910
04:41:06,620 --> 04:41:08,720
I was doing my...

7911
04:41:08,720 --> 04:41:10,820
job as the gold collector.

7912
04:41:11,360 --> 04:41:11,760
Yeah?

7913
04:41:11,940 --> 04:41:13,540
Oh, so you were being greedy.

7914
04:41:15,040 --> 04:41:15,740
What the heck?

7915
04:41:15,820 --> 04:41:16,360
What do you mean greedy?

7916
04:41:16,360 --> 04:41:17,460
This is for the gacha!

7917
04:41:18,060 --> 04:41:19,280
This is for the gacha!

7918
04:41:23,310 --> 04:41:24,430
What happened?

7919
04:41:25,670 --> 04:41:26,570
Oh shit!

7920
04:41:26,730 --> 04:41:27,050
I heard that.

7921
04:41:29,110 --> 04:41:30,650
Oh shit, it's fine.

7922
04:41:31,750 --> 04:41:32,130
Are you okay?

7923
04:41:32,410 --> 04:41:33,590
No, I'm not okay.

7924
04:41:33,710 --> 04:41:34,490
I can't do baseball.

7925
04:41:34,630 --> 04:41:35,410
I can't do baseball.

7926
04:41:35,530 --> 04:41:36,250
I can't do baseball.

7927
04:41:36,570 --> 04:41:38,110
I told you not to try the baseball.

7928
04:41:38,450 --> 04:41:39,010
Where's the...

7929
04:41:39,010 --> 04:41:42,490
I thought it'd be...

7930
04:41:42,490 --> 04:41:43,270
Bam!

7931
04:41:43,410 --> 04:41:43,910
No way!

7932
04:41:43,990 --> 04:41:44,710
How did I miss?

7933
04:41:46,890 --> 04:41:47,370
Bam!

7934
04:41:47,710 --> 04:41:47,890
What?

7935
04:41:50,530 --> 04:41:51,010
How?

7936
04:41:51,250 --> 04:41:51,670
How?

7937
04:41:56,110 --> 04:41:56,630
Go, go, go!

7938
04:41:57,670 --> 04:41:58,730
Go, go, go!

7939
04:42:00,490 --> 04:42:01,090
It's okay.

7940
04:42:01,190 --> 04:42:01,510
I'm okay.

7941
04:42:01,670 --> 04:42:02,550
Nothing bad happened.

7942
04:42:05,330 --> 04:42:07,030
That was literally what happened to me.

7943
04:42:09,190 --> 04:42:10,710
I'm not playing baseball again.

7944
04:42:10,930 --> 04:42:11,770
I'm not playing.

7945
04:42:12,010 --> 04:42:14,870
Oh, so you got greedy with the baseball.

7946
04:42:18,010 --> 04:42:20,550
You got greedy trying to play baseball.

7947
04:42:21,510 --> 04:42:22,510
How do I get over there?

7948
04:42:22,510 --> 04:42:23,690
Oh, I'm on the wrong side.

7949
04:42:23,690 --> 04:42:25,230
Are you still not here?

7950
04:42:25,790 --> 04:42:27,690
I'm over... I literally saw you...

7951
04:42:28,670 --> 04:42:29,390
Bouncing around.

7952
04:42:31,550 --> 04:42:34,390
Oh, he's on you.

7953
04:42:34,430 --> 04:42:34,890
He's on you.

7954
04:42:34,970 --> 04:42:35,650
Oh, thank God.

7955
04:42:35,830 --> 04:42:36,370
Oh, thank God.

7956
04:42:36,430 --> 04:42:37,690
I had PTSD right there.

7957
04:42:42,230 --> 04:42:43,950
Don't let him blow up our nether portal.

7958
04:42:43,950 --> 04:42:44,110
I might die.

7959
04:42:44,550 --> 04:42:45,110
I might die.

7960
04:42:46,010 --> 04:42:46,830
Or maybe not.

7961
04:42:47,510 --> 04:42:48,110
Maybe not.

7962
04:42:48,690 --> 04:42:49,690
Oh, he's still on me.

7963
04:42:49,710 --> 04:42:50,330
He's still on me.

7964
04:42:50,350 --> 04:42:50,730
Where is he?

7965
04:42:50,770 --> 04:42:51,210
Where is he?

7966
04:42:51,210 --> 04:42:52,210
I can't get him.

7967
04:42:52,290 --> 04:42:53,670
All I have is this sword.

7968
04:42:54,230 --> 04:42:54,630
I know.

7969
04:42:56,010 --> 04:42:57,790
Try to aggro him and I'll try to shoot him.

7970
04:42:57,810 --> 04:42:58,250
I'm looking at him.

7971
04:42:58,310 --> 04:43:00,310
I'm literally looking at him and he's not looking back.

7972
04:43:00,670 --> 04:43:02,410
That's not how it works.

7973
04:43:03,090 --> 04:43:04,990
Why do you want me to aggro him?

7974
04:43:05,290 --> 04:43:06,030
I don't know.

7975
04:43:06,910 --> 04:43:09,150
Okay, he's not looking at either of us now.

7976
04:43:09,210 --> 04:43:10,070
He's just chilling.

7977
04:43:10,850 --> 04:43:12,630
He's just waving his little feetsies.

7978
04:43:12,830 --> 04:43:13,550
It doesn't matter.

7979
04:43:13,650 --> 04:43:15,110
He's waving his feetsies.

7980
04:43:15,170 --> 04:43:16,150
Where are you?

7981
04:43:17,230 --> 04:43:18,170
I see an arrow.

7982
04:43:18,570 --> 04:43:19,270
I took one of it.

7983
04:43:19,910 --> 04:43:20,730
You did?

7984
04:43:21,170 --> 04:43:21,250
Yeah.

7985
04:43:21,370 --> 04:43:24,590
Okay, I'm running.

7986
04:43:25,230 --> 04:43:25,790
I'm coming over.

7987
04:43:25,850 --> 04:43:28,310
Come over here right now.

7988
04:43:28,750 --> 04:43:30,070
We're not fucking around no more.

7989
04:43:31,010 --> 04:43:32,790
We're not fucking around.

7990
04:43:35,350 --> 04:43:35,950
Alright.

7991
04:43:36,670 --> 04:43:37,730
It's night time.

7992
04:43:39,630 --> 04:43:41,970
He's like right behind us by the way.

7993
04:43:42,130 --> 04:43:43,210
He's literally right there.

7994
04:43:43,750 --> 04:43:44,530
The ghast.

7995
04:43:45,210 --> 04:43:46,890
Oh, I'm out of the nether.

7996
04:43:47,570 --> 04:43:48,670
I'm out too.

7997
04:43:49,150 --> 04:43:51,250
I mean, we wanted to be night anyway, right?

7998
04:43:52,570 --> 04:43:52,690
Oh.

7999
04:43:52,890 --> 04:43:54,010
For the phantoms, right?

8000
04:43:55,470 --> 04:43:59,350
Yeah, but ideally, we would have like a place to, you know, be safe at.

8001
04:43:59,770 --> 04:44:00,130
Okay.

8002
04:44:00,270 --> 04:44:01,770
Like there's skellies everywhere.

8003
04:44:01,830 --> 04:44:03,350
Alright, pussy, let's do it.

8004
04:44:03,970 --> 04:44:04,810
Yay, yay, yay.

8005
04:44:06,190 --> 04:44:07,510
Yay, yay, yay.

8006
04:44:08,410 --> 04:44:08,890
Alright.

8007
04:44:10,350 --> 04:44:12,710
Someone's a coward, so I'll do it.

8008
04:44:13,690 --> 04:44:14,170
Alright.

8009
04:44:14,170 --> 04:44:16,410
Alright, someone's a little coward.

8010
04:44:16,710 --> 04:44:17,610
That's all I'm saying.

8011
04:44:18,890 --> 04:44:20,330
Okay, we gotta do a marker.

8012
04:44:20,730 --> 04:44:20,890
Okay.

8013
04:44:22,710 --> 04:44:24,350
I don't know what you're talking about.

8014
04:44:24,370 --> 04:44:25,790
Okay, we'll make a peepee tower here.

8015
04:44:26,230 --> 04:44:26,530
Okay.

8016
04:44:26,850 --> 04:44:30,370
Okay, mark this coordinate because we have to come back here.

8017
04:44:32,590 --> 04:44:33,510
You mark it.

8018
04:44:34,070 --> 04:44:34,250
What?

8019
04:44:34,950 --> 04:44:36,490
Chat, mark it.

8020
04:44:37,050 --> 04:44:39,150
I feel like I'm gonna die.

8021
04:44:40,870 --> 04:44:41,790
I marked it.

8022
04:44:47,520 --> 04:44:49,420
Why didn't you jump into the water?

8023
04:44:49,880 --> 04:44:50,520
I'm scared.

8024
04:44:52,240 --> 04:44:52,760
Okay.

8025
04:44:53,160 --> 04:44:54,440
I'm scared I'll miss.

8026
04:44:55,100 --> 04:44:55,940
What if I...

8027
04:44:56,700 --> 04:44:57,660
Oh, I'm sorry.

8028
04:44:57,820 --> 04:45:00,760
I just didn't want to fucking die by fall damage.

8029
04:45:01,360 --> 04:45:07,960
That's even labor than wanting to not die by skeleton and creeper and enderman and literally everything.

8030
04:45:08,180 --> 04:45:09,100
Witches that come after us.

8031
04:45:09,120 --> 04:45:11,060
Literally, majority of our death was from fall damage.

8032
04:45:11,180 --> 04:45:12,800
Literally, that's the majority of our death.

8033
04:45:13,600 --> 04:45:14,120
Majority?

8034
04:45:14,120 --> 04:45:15,300
That's Jessie.

8035
04:45:15,600 --> 04:45:17,380
No, no, no, no.

8036
04:45:18,320 --> 04:45:20,000
Our death, guys.

8037
04:45:21,900 --> 04:45:22,980
Majority of...

8038
04:45:22,980 --> 04:45:24,200
Wait, what are we trying to find again?

8039
04:45:24,340 --> 04:45:24,640
I don't know.

8040
04:45:26,640 --> 04:45:29,780
Ideally, we want to find a village.

8041
04:45:30,340 --> 04:45:30,980
Wait, for what?

8042
04:45:31,560 --> 04:45:32,160
Armadillo.

8043
04:45:34,740 --> 04:45:36,400
It's so cute, isn't it?

8044
04:45:46,680 --> 04:45:47,280
What?

8045
04:45:48,040 --> 04:45:49,000
You hit me.

8046
04:45:49,000 --> 04:45:50,160
No, I didn't.

8047
04:45:50,240 --> 04:45:50,840
The armadillo did.

8048
04:45:53,600 --> 04:45:54,300
The VOD!

8049
04:45:54,860 --> 04:45:55,300
The VOD!

8050
04:45:56,100 --> 04:45:57,660
Check the VOD in 10 hours!

8051
04:46:04,820 --> 04:46:07,100
Wait, why do we need to find a village?

8052
04:46:07,460 --> 04:46:08,280
What was the point?

8053
04:46:10,580 --> 04:46:11,060
Well...

8054
04:46:12,680 --> 04:46:13,160
For...

8055
04:46:13,160 --> 04:46:13,480
Yeah?

8056
04:46:14,980 --> 04:46:16,180
What was it?

8057
04:46:16,540 --> 04:46:17,880
The brewing thing.

8058
04:46:17,940 --> 04:46:18,900
I don't know how to make it.

8059
04:46:18,900 --> 04:46:20,560
Oh, the brewing stand?

8060
04:46:21,620 --> 04:46:21,860
Yeah.

8061
04:46:22,080 --> 04:46:22,920
Wait, where did you go?

8062
04:46:24,140 --> 04:46:25,960
I'm where the armadillo...

8063
04:46:25,960 --> 04:46:26,980
Oh, you went far.

8064
04:46:27,280 --> 04:46:28,580
Wait, I didn't even go anywhere.

8065
04:46:29,040 --> 04:46:31,640
Why are you just taking off on your own?

8066
04:46:31,840 --> 04:46:33,200
I thought you were beside me.

8067
04:46:33,240 --> 04:46:34,180
Why aren't you moving?

8068
04:46:35,520 --> 04:46:36,500
I am moving.

8069
04:46:36,580 --> 04:46:37,280
What are you talking about?

8070
04:46:37,300 --> 04:46:39,040
Why were you still at the armadillo place?

8071
04:46:39,940 --> 04:46:42,380
No, I was looking at something in my inventory.

8072
04:46:44,000 --> 04:46:45,260
Stone and blaze rod.

8073
04:46:45,260 --> 04:46:46,560
Yeah, see?

8074
04:46:46,780 --> 04:46:49,260
I don't want to waste a blaze rod on the...

8075
04:46:49,920 --> 04:46:51,000
The potion stand.

8076
04:46:51,000 --> 04:46:52,280
Why do we need blaze rods again?

8077
04:46:53,160 --> 04:46:54,360
For the...

8078
04:46:54,360 --> 04:46:56,860
Things to activate the...

8079
04:46:56,860 --> 04:46:58,180
The end portal.

8080
04:46:58,620 --> 04:47:01,300
We actually do need them.

8081
04:47:04,000 --> 04:47:05,100
Let's go straight.

8082
04:47:06,640 --> 04:47:07,240
Straight?

8083
04:47:07,620 --> 04:47:07,940
Yeah.

8084
04:47:08,600 --> 04:47:09,900
Here, I'm gonna make a boat.

8085
04:47:10,200 --> 04:47:10,500
Alright.

8086
04:47:10,500 --> 04:47:10,600
Alright.

8087
04:47:17,280 --> 04:47:18,620
I have crafting table.

8088
04:47:19,300 --> 04:47:20,220
Oh, I just made one.

8089
04:47:20,740 --> 04:47:22,280
Oh, you could've asked.

8090
04:47:23,380 --> 04:47:24,940
You could've spoken up.

8091
04:47:25,060 --> 04:47:25,880
You could've asked.

8092
04:47:26,580 --> 04:47:29,540
Oh, you're not gonna bring the crafting table you made?

8093
04:47:30,420 --> 04:47:32,100
No, I am just thinking about it.

8094
04:47:32,120 --> 04:47:33,340
There's trees everywhere.

8095
04:47:34,680 --> 04:47:36,100
There's trees everywhere.

8096
04:47:36,100 --> 04:47:37,740
Oh yeah, and then you're gonna be like...

8097
04:47:37,740 --> 04:47:40,320
Oh Doki, I broke my pickaxe.

8098
04:47:40,360 --> 04:47:42,160
I need somebody to help me.

8099
04:47:42,220 --> 04:47:43,360
I don't have any wood.

8100
04:47:43,360 --> 04:47:43,460
What?

8101
04:47:44,700 --> 04:47:45,740
That's gonna happen.

8102
04:47:45,920 --> 04:47:49,100
That might happen.

8103
04:47:50,480 --> 04:47:51,500
If that happens...

8104
04:47:51,500 --> 04:47:52,880
I'll just die and then we'll restart.

8105
04:47:55,400 --> 04:47:57,040
What if we did a run...

8106
04:47:57,040 --> 04:47:59,040
Where it was not only hardcore...

8107
04:47:59,040 --> 04:48:01,360
But you could only make one of...

8108
04:48:01,960 --> 04:48:02,700
What the hell?

8109
04:48:03,760 --> 04:48:04,700
Does he have anything?

8110
04:48:04,920 --> 04:48:05,820
Yeah, he might have stuff.

8111
04:48:07,620 --> 04:48:09,080
He might have trading stuff.

8112
04:48:10,200 --> 04:48:11,560
No, he doesn't have anything.

8113
04:48:11,560 --> 04:48:13,600
Oh my god, you're actually worthless.

8114
04:48:15,860 --> 04:48:17,560
They're gonna spit on us now.

8115
04:48:17,720 --> 04:48:18,280
It's fine.

8116
04:48:19,360 --> 04:48:20,800
Now you have no owner.

8117
04:48:21,380 --> 04:48:21,720
Hey!

8118
04:48:22,820 --> 04:48:24,680
Now they'll just die here.

8119
04:48:25,380 --> 04:48:26,500
Yeah, they'll die here.

8120
04:48:26,560 --> 04:48:29,440
Yeah, they're domesticated so they can't live in the wild.

8121
04:48:29,460 --> 04:48:31,740
They're gonna come back like Alan Wake.

8122
04:48:32,680 --> 04:48:34,520
You killed my owner!

8123
04:48:34,520 --> 04:48:34,640
You killed my owner!

8124
04:48:39,020 --> 04:48:41,060
Oh yeah, this is a hit and run.

8125
04:48:41,180 --> 04:48:41,780
That's right.

8126
04:48:42,520 --> 04:48:43,560
What are you gonna do?

8127
04:48:43,700 --> 04:48:44,700
Fucking kill us?

8128
04:48:45,660 --> 04:48:46,360
They could.

8129
04:48:47,060 --> 04:48:49,460
They were just bad enough, maybe.

8130
04:48:50,100 --> 04:48:51,880
Oh, my chat is just so...

8131
04:48:52,500 --> 04:48:54,160
Sad, making me so sad right now.

8132
04:48:54,180 --> 04:48:54,620
Wait, why?

8133
04:48:55,400 --> 04:48:57,640
They just keep saying a hawk tour.

8134
04:48:59,080 --> 04:49:01,260
Yeah, they said that too and I ignored them.

8135
04:49:01,260 --> 04:49:03,940
I'm not here to encourage this behavior.

8136
04:49:04,060 --> 04:49:04,560
I know.

8137
04:49:06,820 --> 04:49:09,520
I don't understand why that meme is so popular.

8138
04:49:10,160 --> 04:49:10,900
I don't...

8139
04:49:10,900 --> 04:49:11,500
I don't...

8140
04:49:11,500 --> 04:49:13,900
I don't think it's funny.

8141
04:49:14,720 --> 04:49:19,280
I think it's one of those things where it's easy to get people to say it.

8142
04:49:19,400 --> 04:49:21,260
You know, like...

8143
04:49:22,000 --> 04:49:23,020
Like, you can...

8144
04:49:23,020 --> 04:49:27,860
Kind of like with the mic memes and all, you can get people to say them easily.

8145
04:49:27,860 --> 04:49:29,440
Yeah, but that's clever.

8146
04:49:30,080 --> 04:49:31,860
The other one's not as clever.

8147
04:49:32,160 --> 04:49:33,580
Like, it's just...

8148
04:49:33,580 --> 04:49:34,340
And then, like...

8149
04:49:34,340 --> 04:49:38,500
I admire the girl for milking that shit so hard.

8150
04:49:38,540 --> 04:49:39,040
Oh, my God.

8151
04:49:39,140 --> 04:49:40,900
She went crazy with it.

8152
04:49:41,240 --> 04:49:43,140
There's Halloween costumes.

8153
04:49:43,620 --> 04:49:44,760
I was like, how do you make Halloween?

8154
04:49:44,980 --> 04:49:46,240
You saw the Halloween costumes?

8155
04:49:46,380 --> 04:49:49,460
How the fuck do you make a Halloween costume?

8156
04:49:49,880 --> 04:49:50,840
You don't!

8157
04:49:51,060 --> 04:49:53,220
Yeah, but it's in spirit Halloween.

8158
04:49:53,940 --> 04:49:55,300
I saw pictures of it.

8159
04:49:55,520 --> 04:49:56,840
And then there's like podcasts.

8160
04:49:56,840 --> 04:49:58,100
There's videos.

8161
04:49:58,440 --> 04:50:00,140
There's like...

8162
04:50:00,140 --> 04:50:03,220
She got signed a million dollar kick contract.

8163
04:50:03,660 --> 04:50:04,220
And everything.

8164
04:50:04,940 --> 04:50:05,000
What?

8165
04:50:05,360 --> 04:50:08,600
Yeah, she signed a contract to stream exclusively on kick.

8166
04:50:09,280 --> 04:50:09,980
And like...

8167
04:50:09,980 --> 04:50:13,940
A lot of the contracts are a million dollars and stuff.

8168
04:50:14,400 --> 04:50:15,040
And like...

8169
04:50:15,040 --> 04:50:17,960
She is a business woman.

8170
04:50:18,540 --> 04:50:18,860
Right there.

8171
04:50:20,550 --> 04:50:21,600
I honestly...

8172
04:50:21,600 --> 04:50:23,240
I didn't know who her agent is.

8173
04:50:23,240 --> 04:50:23,460
Like...

8174
04:50:25,620 --> 04:50:27,220
I want a Halloween costume.

8175
04:50:27,220 --> 04:50:28,120
A spirit Halloween.

8176
04:50:28,580 --> 04:50:31,480
Yeah, but you have to lose all your dignity to get it.

8177
04:50:31,940 --> 04:50:32,920
Okay, like...

8178
04:50:32,920 --> 04:50:33,980
Not like that though.

8179
04:50:34,140 --> 04:50:38,160
You have to lose your dignity to gain the spirit Halloween costume.

8180
04:50:39,640 --> 04:50:40,820
Is it worth it?

8181
04:50:40,840 --> 04:50:43,560
I'm gonna email spirit Halloween and be like...

8182
04:50:44,380 --> 04:50:47,240
Do you want to make me a Halloween costume?

8183
04:50:48,220 --> 04:50:49,720
I'll say something dumb.

8184
04:50:50,560 --> 04:50:52,320
All you have to do is open your mouth.

8185
04:50:53,400 --> 04:50:54,600
That's everyday.

8186
04:50:55,000 --> 04:50:56,020
Yeah, it's everyday.

8187
04:50:56,620 --> 04:50:59,880
Do you think we'll ever go back to our nether portal?

8188
04:51:00,880 --> 04:51:01,800
I have the coordinates.

8189
04:51:02,020 --> 04:51:03,360
It's so far.

8190
04:51:05,500 --> 04:51:08,640
It's a five million dollar kick contract?

8191
04:51:08,820 --> 04:51:11,200
Not even a million dollars?

8192
04:51:11,980 --> 04:51:12,940
Five million?

8193
04:51:12,960 --> 04:51:14,220
Five million?

8194
04:51:15,120 --> 04:51:16,240
I've never like...

8195
04:51:16,240 --> 04:51:17,920
I don't think I even...

8196
04:51:17,920 --> 04:51:19,460
Oh no, I did watch the original video.

8197
04:51:19,780 --> 04:51:21,660
I watched the original, how she got popular.

8198
04:51:22,140 --> 04:51:23,900
I've never seen anything else about her.

8199
04:51:24,020 --> 04:51:24,920
Is she actually funny?

8200
04:51:25,100 --> 04:51:26,380
Is the podcast any good?

8201
04:51:26,440 --> 04:51:29,140
I think she just has a country accent.

8202
04:51:32,780 --> 04:51:33,740
She's like...

8203
04:51:33,740 --> 04:51:37,420
Yeah, she has like a very heavy southern...

8204
04:51:37,420 --> 04:51:38,380
Did we make that?

8205
04:51:39,000 --> 04:51:40,980
What is that?

8206
04:51:41,420 --> 04:51:42,360
Did you make that?

8207
04:51:42,580 --> 04:51:44,160
No, I didn't.

8208
04:51:44,160 --> 04:51:45,620
I broke my peepee tower.

8209
04:51:45,760 --> 04:51:47,220
What the fuck is that?

8210
04:51:47,660 --> 04:51:49,060
It's a false peepee tower.

8211
04:51:49,340 --> 04:51:49,920
Ignore, ignore.

8212
04:51:50,300 --> 04:51:51,400
Wait, what?

8213
04:51:51,840 --> 04:51:53,140
What is this spot?

8214
04:51:55,000 --> 04:51:56,380
Don't go towards the jungle.

8215
04:51:56,580 --> 04:51:57,100
I think there's not really...

8216
04:51:57,100 --> 04:51:59,400
I feel like she's just a...

8217
04:51:59,400 --> 04:52:01,540
Like an inside job.

8218
04:52:02,880 --> 04:52:04,160
Oh, one of those...

8219
04:52:04,800 --> 04:52:05,840
Like she's like a plant.

8220
04:52:06,380 --> 04:52:08,720
Yeah, she has to be an industry plant.

8221
04:52:09,320 --> 04:52:10,540
I don't think so.

8222
04:52:10,760 --> 04:52:11,980
I don't understand.

8223
04:52:11,980 --> 04:52:14,140
She's like mainstream, so it's like...

8224
04:52:14,140 --> 04:52:15,400
I don't understand.

8225
04:52:15,840 --> 04:52:16,960
Am I not normie enough?

8226
04:52:17,600 --> 04:52:19,520
Maybe I'm not normie enough.

8227
04:52:20,520 --> 04:52:21,320
Where do I go?

8228
04:52:21,540 --> 04:52:21,980
Your turn.

8229
04:52:26,560 --> 04:52:29,980
You were literally in the front seat.

8230
04:52:30,060 --> 04:52:33,080
They made a change where if somebody gets off, you're pushed to the front.

8231
04:52:34,000 --> 04:52:34,780
Oh, okay, okay.

8232
04:52:35,160 --> 04:52:37,960
I have no idea who you're talking about.

8233
04:52:38,820 --> 04:52:39,280
Google...

8234
04:52:39,280 --> 04:52:40,380
What is it?

8235
04:52:41,980 --> 04:52:43,840
It sounds French.

8236
04:52:44,080 --> 04:52:44,900
I'm not going to lie.

8237
04:52:47,380 --> 04:52:50,540
Make it sound like a grandpa explaining it.

8238
04:52:51,060 --> 04:52:52,200
We're going to get that.

8239
04:52:53,840 --> 04:52:55,580
You're going to get that.

8240
04:52:59,040 --> 04:53:00,420
It's actually quite elegant.

8241
04:53:00,780 --> 04:53:01,920
It's a simple thing.

8242
04:53:09,280 --> 04:53:09,900
It's a simple thing.

8243
04:53:20,480 --> 04:53:21,980
Anyway, google that.

8244
04:53:23,140 --> 04:53:24,260
She's everywhere.

8245
04:53:24,980 --> 04:53:26,900
Oh yeah, you can't miss her.

8246
04:53:27,740 --> 04:53:27,980
Yeah.

8247
04:53:30,220 --> 04:53:31,320
There's a savannah.

8248
04:53:32,100 --> 04:53:33,440
Yeah, maybe there will be a place.

8249
04:53:33,520 --> 04:53:37,240
But usually it's the plains ones that have the...

8250
04:53:37,840 --> 04:53:38,720
Actually, no.

8251
04:53:38,880 --> 04:53:40,280
There it is!

8252
04:53:41,680 --> 04:53:42,000
Village!

8253
04:53:42,820 --> 04:53:44,380
I knew it.

8254
04:53:44,940 --> 04:53:46,800
Someone's like, wait, I get it now.

8255
04:53:46,900 --> 04:53:47,780
It is funny.

8256
04:53:48,400 --> 04:53:49,680
No, it's not.

8257
04:53:50,620 --> 04:53:54,260
It's because we made an actual funny joke over it.

8258
04:53:55,780 --> 04:53:57,380
We fixed the joke, everybody.

8259
04:53:57,740 --> 04:53:59,100
We fixed it.

8260
04:53:59,260 --> 04:54:01,800
That's why you guys find it funny now.

8261
04:54:04,140 --> 04:54:06,840
It's not our fault that we're so funny.

8262
04:54:09,620 --> 04:54:11,560
Oh, there's another saddle here.

8263
04:54:12,020 --> 04:54:13,460
We're just natural comedians.

8264
04:54:17,340 --> 04:54:18,940
Oh, this village kind of sucks.

8265
04:54:18,960 --> 04:54:20,360
Yeah, this village does suck.

8266
04:54:20,500 --> 04:54:23,340
Oh my gosh, the people in the savannah don't know how to fucking cook.

8267
04:54:24,540 --> 04:54:26,300
I got some bread and that's it.

8268
04:54:26,960 --> 04:54:28,880
I don't think they have it in the savannah.

8269
04:54:29,040 --> 04:54:30,520
Well, we have to sleep in this village anyway.

8270
04:54:31,320 --> 04:54:31,680
Yeah.

8271
04:54:33,460 --> 04:54:34,180
There's melons.

8272
04:54:35,800 --> 04:54:36,160
Melons!

8273
04:54:38,320 --> 04:54:40,020
Oh, I see you're going over there.

8274
04:54:40,520 --> 04:54:42,220
Yeah, I'm just trying to see if there's any more chest.

8275
04:54:42,280 --> 04:54:43,300
There's bread, but that's it.

8276
04:54:43,380 --> 04:54:44,160
I'm in the bed now.

8277
04:54:44,220 --> 04:54:44,980
You can sleep now.

8278
04:54:45,380 --> 04:54:46,520
Okay, I'm getting in the bed.

8279
04:54:47,580 --> 04:54:48,320
Get up, mister.

8280
04:54:50,840 --> 04:54:51,560
Too small.

8281
04:54:51,680 --> 04:54:52,900
Too small of a village.

8282
04:54:53,300 --> 04:54:54,800
My 5 million dollar contract.

8283
04:54:55,660 --> 04:54:56,420
I won't take it.

8284
04:54:56,480 --> 04:54:57,960
I just like to have it offered.

8285
04:54:58,740 --> 04:54:59,040
Really?

8286
04:55:01,820 --> 04:55:02,220
Yeah.

8287
04:55:05,120 --> 04:55:06,580
I don't know, actually.

8288
04:55:07,520 --> 04:55:08,860
I don't know.

8289
04:55:09,000 --> 04:55:10,580
5 million dollars is a lot.

8290
04:55:11,040 --> 04:55:11,960
It is a lot.

8291
04:55:12,100 --> 04:55:13,120
It is a lot.

8292
04:55:13,640 --> 04:55:16,920
I don't think though I would want a contract to exclusively stream.

8293
04:55:16,960 --> 04:55:18,040
Yeah, I feel like...

8294
04:55:18,040 --> 04:55:18,980
No, I'd be like...

8295
04:55:18,980 --> 04:55:20,220
I'll take it, but like...

8296
04:55:20,220 --> 04:55:24,520
You know the xQc contract where he sometimes streams on kick, but not exclusively?

8297
04:55:25,520 --> 04:55:26,700
That's what he does.

8298
04:55:26,900 --> 04:55:27,060
Oh, I know.

8299
04:55:27,140 --> 04:55:29,200
But he got paid more than 5 million dollars.

8300
04:55:29,200 --> 04:55:32,560
He got paid like 50 million dollars or something.

8301
04:55:32,800 --> 04:55:34,140
I think we can leave this place.

8302
04:55:34,380 --> 04:55:35,160
Yeah, we can leave this.

8303
04:55:35,280 --> 04:55:35,700
Wait, wait, wait.

8304
04:55:35,920 --> 04:55:36,280
Back to the boat.

8305
04:55:36,600 --> 04:55:37,680
Yeah, boat time.

8306
04:55:38,460 --> 04:55:39,380
I don't know.

8307
04:55:39,740 --> 04:55:41,180
I know like...

8308
04:55:41,180 --> 04:55:45,600
I don't know if you got this offer on your YouTube channel, but like...

8309
04:55:45,600 --> 04:55:49,540
My YouTube partner manager was like emailing me and calling me...

8310
04:55:49,540 --> 04:55:50,660
Asking me if I wanted...

8311
04:55:51,080 --> 04:55:52,920
Yeah, no, they called me on my phone too.

8312
04:55:53,240 --> 04:55:53,360
Yeah.

8313
04:55:55,440 --> 04:55:57,200
And they were asking me...

8314
04:55:57,200 --> 04:55:59,500
If I wanted to...

8315
04:55:59,500 --> 04:56:01,480
Oh yeah, no, xQc was 100 million.

8316
04:56:01,680 --> 04:56:03,140
Yeah, sorry, I low-balled that.

8317
04:56:03,340 --> 04:56:03,380
What?

8318
04:56:03,380 --> 04:56:03,780
That's insane!

8319
04:56:04,000 --> 04:56:06,800
He got 100 million dollars to stream...

8320
04:56:06,800 --> 04:56:08,420
Not exclusively on Twitch.

8321
04:56:08,620 --> 04:56:09,360
I mean kick.

8322
04:56:09,620 --> 04:56:12,020
Basically, he can stream on kick sometimes.

8323
04:56:12,100 --> 04:56:12,940
Not all the time.

8324
04:56:14,600 --> 04:56:16,220
But he can keep his Twitch account.

8325
04:56:17,260 --> 04:56:18,280
Wait, am I going the right way?

8326
04:56:18,460 --> 04:56:19,000
I don't know.

8327
04:56:19,280 --> 04:56:20,760
But like...

8328
04:56:21,360 --> 04:56:23,160
They called me and was like...

8329
04:56:23,160 --> 04:56:25,520
Oh, for your VODs that got...

8330
04:56:25,520 --> 04:56:27,580
Restricted to R18...

8331
04:56:27,580 --> 04:56:29,720
Which was my one VOD, which was the FNAF VOD.

8332
04:56:30,020 --> 04:56:31,140
Because I was like...

8333
04:56:31,140 --> 04:56:33,180
Apparently I swore too much in that video.

8334
04:56:33,280 --> 04:56:35,020
And it got R18 gated.

8335
04:56:35,400 --> 04:56:36,600
And I think it's because I was like...

8336
04:56:36,600 --> 04:56:37,760
Hoar, hoar, hoar, hoar, hoar.

8337
04:56:38,020 --> 04:56:39,420
Oh, I heard about that!

8338
04:56:40,360 --> 04:56:43,040
Yeah, they thought you were saying...

8339
04:56:43,040 --> 04:56:44,100
They saw I was saying hoar.

8340
04:56:44,480 --> 04:56:45,880
And I was singing it a lot.

8341
04:56:48,640 --> 04:56:49,040
And...

8342
04:56:49,840 --> 04:56:51,600
Yeah, I'll grab the boat.

8343
04:56:52,260 --> 04:56:53,700
And so they were calling me.

8344
04:56:53,800 --> 04:56:54,320
They were like...

8345
04:56:55,040 --> 04:56:57,780
Oh, hey, we were wondering...

8346
04:56:57,780 --> 04:56:59,440
For your VODs that got R18...

8347
04:56:59,440 --> 04:57:00,380
We're trying this new thing.

8348
04:57:00,900 --> 04:57:02,840
And basically, it's like...

8349
04:57:04,320 --> 04:57:06,720
Since R18 are limited ads...

8350
04:57:06,720 --> 04:57:06,940
Yeah?

8351
04:57:07,360 --> 04:57:07,840
They're like...

8352
04:57:07,840 --> 04:57:11,620
Oh, can we put gambling and smoking and drinking ads on your videos?

8353
04:57:12,720 --> 04:57:14,460
For R18 videos?

8354
04:57:14,720 --> 04:57:15,460
I was like...

8355
04:57:15,460 --> 04:57:15,880
No.

8356
04:57:18,620 --> 04:57:21,020
Because apparently you can get a lot of money from that.

8357
04:57:21,020 --> 04:57:22,820
Because it's...

8358
04:57:22,820 --> 04:57:24,600
You know, casinos pay so much.

8359
04:57:24,740 --> 04:57:25,480
And I was like...

8360
04:57:25,480 --> 04:57:26,700
No, that's okay.

8361
04:57:27,080 --> 04:57:28,420
Do you get that money?

8362
04:57:31,120 --> 04:57:32,340
It's ad revenue.

8363
04:57:32,940 --> 04:57:35,860
But then you get ad revenue from...

8364
04:57:35,860 --> 04:57:38,420
Because when it's restricted, you get...

8365
04:57:38,420 --> 04:57:40,720
You tend to not get ads and stuff.

8366
04:57:41,340 --> 04:57:42,460
Oh, there's a preset!

8367
04:57:42,600 --> 04:57:43,400
There's a preset right here!

8368
04:57:43,520 --> 04:57:46,820
Oh my god, we did it.

8369
04:57:47,500 --> 04:57:48,040
Chat...

8370
04:57:48,580 --> 04:57:49,920
Reddit, we did it.

8371
04:57:50,580 --> 04:57:51,600
We did it.

8372
04:57:51,680 --> 04:57:54,080
This might be the shortest hardcore session...

8373
04:57:55,040 --> 04:57:56,020
That streamers have ever done.

8374
04:57:56,140 --> 04:57:56,660
Right here.

8375
04:57:57,880 --> 04:57:59,420
Right here, right now.

8376
04:58:00,340 --> 04:58:02,240
Okay, we still need the blaze rods.

8377
04:58:04,020 --> 04:58:05,620
Anything else they got here?

8378
04:58:06,880 --> 04:58:07,880
Just pillage them.

8379
04:58:08,100 --> 04:58:08,480
Loot them.

8380
04:58:10,280 --> 04:58:12,160
I think we looted everything.

8381
04:58:12,720 --> 04:58:14,620
Their villages are so terrible.

8382
04:58:14,760 --> 04:58:15,140
I don't know.

8383
04:58:15,320 --> 04:58:16,480
Maybe because they're poor.

8384
04:58:16,480 --> 04:58:17,320
Maybe...

8385
04:58:19,200 --> 04:58:21,180
Oh, they have a better furnace here.

8386
04:58:22,080 --> 04:58:22,620
Oh, that furnace?

8387
04:58:22,820 --> 04:58:23,180
Nice.

8388
04:58:24,260 --> 04:58:25,220
How did you get inside?

8389
04:58:25,280 --> 04:58:25,880
Oh, there you are.

8390
04:58:27,260 --> 04:58:28,520
What do I not need?

8391
04:58:29,000 --> 04:58:29,760
You wanna grab it?

8392
04:58:30,040 --> 04:58:30,460
Do you have room?

8393
04:58:31,960 --> 04:58:32,680
I do.

8394
04:58:32,840 --> 04:58:35,280
I can get rid of the one iron nugget.

8395
04:58:35,540 --> 04:58:36,660
And the sweet seed.

8396
04:58:38,140 --> 04:58:39,520
What else can I get rid of?

8397
04:58:41,020 --> 04:58:43,320
Okay, I'm gonna get rid of the nether break.

8398
04:58:44,620 --> 04:58:45,060
And...

8399
04:58:45,060 --> 04:58:45,500
This.

8400
04:58:48,340 --> 04:58:48,820
And...

8401
04:58:48,820 --> 04:58:50,660
We need an enchanting table.

8402
04:58:54,010 --> 04:58:55,950
I mean, I have obsidian for enchanting.

8403
04:58:56,130 --> 04:58:59,050
Yeah, we need books, but...

8404
04:58:59,050 --> 04:59:00,130
Why did...

8405
04:59:00,130 --> 04:59:01,110
I should've kept the leather.

8406
04:59:01,870 --> 04:59:03,950
Wait, no, it doesn't matter.

8407
04:59:03,990 --> 04:59:04,770
Because we don't have paper.

8408
04:59:06,130 --> 04:59:06,510
Yeah.

8409
04:59:11,730 --> 04:59:13,530
How do we wanna do this?

8410
04:59:13,530 --> 04:59:15,810
Do we go back into the nether?

8411
04:59:16,210 --> 04:59:17,670
And risk it now?

8412
04:59:19,290 --> 04:59:21,030
We have to find a...

8413
04:59:21,030 --> 04:59:21,650
I feel like...

8414
04:59:21,650 --> 04:59:23,690
I think at this point, we got...

8415
04:59:23,690 --> 04:59:24,690
Wait, how many...

8416
04:59:25,310 --> 04:59:26,490
How many enderpearls do we have?

8417
04:59:26,490 --> 04:59:28,170
I have 6 enderpearls.

8418
04:59:30,810 --> 04:59:31,550
I think...

8419
04:59:31,550 --> 04:59:35,950
I was gonna say it would be maybe more worth it to just go find a new ender portal.

8420
04:59:36,230 --> 04:59:36,710
But...

8421
04:59:36,710 --> 04:59:37,550
Or make a new one.

8422
04:59:37,610 --> 04:59:39,170
We left all our stuff back there.

8423
04:59:40,030 --> 04:59:41,450
I didn't leave my stuff.

8424
04:59:44,430 --> 04:59:47,050
I left a lot of my stuff in that chest.

8425
04:59:49,270 --> 04:59:51,810
Wait, I don't even know what I left there.

8426
04:59:52,750 --> 04:59:54,670
Then you won't miss it.

8427
04:59:54,970 --> 04:59:55,870
You won't even know.

8428
04:59:56,130 --> 04:59:57,330
What if it's important?

8429
04:59:57,810 --> 04:59:59,910
We can go back.

8430
05:00:00,190 --> 05:00:02,090
Chat, chat, was it important?

8431
05:00:02,570 --> 05:00:03,610
Chat, no, I have the boat.

8432
05:00:04,130 --> 05:00:05,390
Chat, was it important?

8433
05:00:05,590 --> 05:00:08,410
Because I don't remember if it was important.

8434
05:00:11,450 --> 05:00:11,970
Do we need sugar cane?

8435
05:00:12,130 --> 05:00:12,870
Do we need paper?

8436
05:00:16,050 --> 05:00:17,710
Yeah, that makes paper.

8437
05:00:18,110 --> 05:00:20,490
But we need a lot of it.

8438
05:00:20,730 --> 05:00:21,990
We're gonna need a ton of it.

8439
05:00:22,190 --> 05:00:25,170
Then it's easier for us to just find bookcases.

8440
05:00:25,910 --> 05:00:26,570
I think so.

8441
05:00:26,870 --> 05:00:27,830
More pillaging, maybe.

8442
05:00:29,890 --> 05:00:30,330
Alright.

8443
05:00:31,250 --> 05:00:31,950
Here we go.

8444
05:00:32,370 --> 05:00:32,950
Why are you swimming?

8445
05:00:33,070 --> 05:00:34,490
I literally put the boat down.

8446
05:00:34,590 --> 05:00:35,390
Oh, I didn't know.

8447
05:00:35,610 --> 05:00:36,150
I didn't see.

8448
05:00:36,150 --> 05:00:37,870
Oh my god.

8449
05:00:38,110 --> 05:00:39,230
Oh, it's lapis blocks.

8450
05:00:39,310 --> 05:00:40,910
I left all the lapis blocks there.

8451
05:00:41,250 --> 05:00:41,970
Oh, okay.

8452
05:00:42,010 --> 05:00:42,670
We do need this.

8453
05:00:42,690 --> 05:00:43,490
Yeah, we do need this.

8454
05:00:43,530 --> 05:00:46,110
It was like a stack of lapis.

8455
05:00:46,990 --> 05:00:47,250
Okay.

8456
05:00:47,710 --> 05:00:48,930
How do we get back?

8457
05:00:49,310 --> 05:00:49,590
I don't know.

8458
05:00:49,650 --> 05:00:50,730
You had the coordinates.

8459
05:00:51,150 --> 05:00:54,170
Doki, I'm gonna give you the coordinates, and you're gonna guide us, okay?

8460
05:00:54,470 --> 05:00:54,750
Okay.

8461
05:00:55,890 --> 05:00:57,350
Okay, I gotta get the polterpolter.

8462
05:00:57,370 --> 05:00:57,650
Okay.

8463
05:00:59,170 --> 05:01:02,530
Alright, so the first part, we weren't able to get that done.

8464
05:01:03,110 --> 05:01:03,390
Okay.

8465
05:01:03,390 --> 05:01:04,810
Okay, it's...

8466
05:01:06,890 --> 05:01:07,730
Okay, it's...

8467
05:01:07,730 --> 05:01:09,110
Negative four...

8468
05:01:09,110 --> 05:01:11,390
One, one, six...

8469
05:01:11,390 --> 05:01:13,390
Negative four, one, one, six...

8470
05:01:14,290 --> 05:01:15,670
Our chat, write that down.

8471
05:01:15,770 --> 05:01:16,710
Chat, write that down.

8472
05:01:17,150 --> 05:01:18,370
Why can't I send a message?

8473
05:01:18,570 --> 05:01:19,590
Why don't you just look at chat?

8474
05:01:21,790 --> 05:01:23,430
Why can't I send a chat message?

8475
05:01:23,690 --> 05:01:24,670
I don't fucking know.

8476
05:01:25,050 --> 05:01:26,050
This is your server.

8477
05:01:27,070 --> 05:01:28,310
Oh, maybe I didn't give you permission.

8478
05:01:29,410 --> 05:01:29,830
Lol.

8479
05:01:29,830 --> 05:01:29,910
Lol.

8480
05:01:30,570 --> 05:01:31,170
Lol.

8481
05:01:32,710 --> 05:01:35,330
Wait, what does it say when you try to send it?

8482
05:01:35,790 --> 05:01:38,350
It says, cannot send chat message.

8483
05:01:39,310 --> 05:01:39,910
Lol.

8484
05:01:40,010 --> 05:01:40,510
Lol.

8485
05:01:41,950 --> 05:01:42,550
Bad.

8486
05:01:43,210 --> 05:01:43,810
Unmuted.

8487
05:01:47,590 --> 05:01:49,730
Wait, why can I send chat message?

8488
05:01:50,170 --> 05:01:52,110
Oh, I think you have to...

8489
05:01:52,490 --> 05:01:53,830
Your account might be like...

8490
05:01:54,870 --> 05:01:55,850
It's like a...

8491
05:01:55,850 --> 05:01:57,350
It's not the server.

8492
05:01:57,350 --> 05:01:59,390
It's like...

8493
05:01:59,390 --> 05:02:01,130
Your account got marked...

8494
05:02:01,130 --> 05:02:03,350
Am I marked as a baby?

8495
05:02:03,550 --> 05:02:04,810
Yeah, you're marked as a baby.

8496
05:02:05,750 --> 05:02:06,050
No!

8497
05:02:06,850 --> 05:02:07,910
Why did that happen?

8498
05:02:08,970 --> 05:02:10,730
I think you're marked as a baby.

8499
05:02:11,810 --> 05:02:12,890
I don't know.

8500
05:02:14,270 --> 05:02:15,710
Wait, how are we gonna do this?

8501
05:02:15,830 --> 05:02:17,030
You have the coordinates.

8502
05:02:17,190 --> 05:02:17,850
I gave them to you.

8503
05:02:18,210 --> 05:02:19,850
What was the coordinates, chat?

8504
05:02:20,450 --> 05:02:21,050
Yeah, chat.

8505
05:02:21,910 --> 05:02:23,770
Chat never lies to her, apparently.

8506
05:02:27,690 --> 05:02:28,990
Chat, what was it?

8507
05:02:30,870 --> 05:02:31,950
I'm just gonna keep going.

8508
05:02:32,610 --> 05:02:33,790
Negative 4116.

8509
05:02:34,030 --> 05:02:34,550
And?

8510
05:02:35,470 --> 05:02:36,890
You never gave me the Z.

8511
05:02:37,190 --> 05:02:38,130
Yes, I did!

8512
05:02:38,150 --> 05:02:39,270
No, you didn't!

8513
05:02:39,370 --> 05:02:42,690
I remember you said the X only.

8514
05:02:42,830 --> 05:02:44,650
And then you were like, why can't I write it down?

8515
05:02:44,770 --> 05:02:46,450
Oh, because I was typing it.

8516
05:02:46,770 --> 05:02:49,470
Negative 4116.

8517
05:02:50,010 --> 05:02:51,750
And then 1576.

8518
05:02:52,690 --> 05:02:53,230
1576.

8519
05:02:53,590 --> 05:02:55,350
Okay, negative 4116.

8520
05:02:55,350 --> 05:02:56,130
Negative 4116.

8521
05:02:56,830 --> 05:02:57,670
Keep going.

8522
05:02:58,950 --> 05:02:59,650
I'm going.

8523
05:03:00,590 --> 05:03:01,550
Negative 4116.

8524
05:03:01,870 --> 05:03:03,550
Okay, you're the one navigating.

8525
05:03:03,830 --> 05:03:06,390
And then 1576.

8526
05:03:06,910 --> 05:03:08,130
Oh yeah, that's the fake one.

8527
05:03:08,550 --> 05:03:09,490
Yeah, we're close.

8528
05:03:10,690 --> 05:03:11,950
Okay, what do you need?

8529
05:03:12,730 --> 05:03:13,710
Is there anything else you need?

8530
05:03:13,850 --> 05:03:16,890
Okay, while you roll that boat, I'm gonna feed my dog.

8531
05:03:17,630 --> 05:03:17,990
What?

8532
05:03:18,210 --> 05:03:20,390
I gave you those coordinates so that you would guide me.

8533
05:03:20,390 --> 05:03:21,730
Negative 4116.

8534
05:03:21,730 --> 05:03:24,470
I gave you the coordinates so that you would guide me.

8535
05:03:25,050 --> 05:03:25,570
1576.

8536
05:03:25,790 --> 05:03:27,030
Negative 4116.

8537
05:03:27,430 --> 05:03:27,650
You're fine.

8538
05:03:28,470 --> 05:03:29,130
I'll be right back.

8539
05:03:35,870 --> 05:03:36,910
This is...

8540
05:03:36,910 --> 05:03:39,110
Who is pulling all the weight here, everybody?

8541
05:03:39,670 --> 05:03:41,510
I want everybody to remember...

8542
05:03:41,510 --> 05:03:42,990
That it is I...

8543
05:03:42,990 --> 05:03:45,390
Mint Phantom...

8544
05:03:45,390 --> 05:03:47,590
That has been pulling all the weight...

8545
05:03:48,010 --> 05:03:48,970
In this collab.

8546
05:03:49,710 --> 05:03:51,330
I'm getting us back to that.

8547
05:03:51,330 --> 05:03:53,650
I've been telling her all the information.

8548
05:03:53,930 --> 05:03:56,050
I'm getting us back to our tower.

8549
05:03:56,490 --> 05:03:58,190
And I'm doing all of this.

8550
05:03:59,330 --> 05:04:00,590
Should I break the boat?

8551
05:04:00,710 --> 05:04:01,310
Let her drown?

8552
05:04:02,030 --> 05:04:04,010
I don't think she'll be back in time to save herself.

8553
05:04:07,850 --> 05:04:11,670
I don't think she'll be back in time to save herself.

8554
05:04:13,670 --> 05:04:15,030
Guys, if we...

8555
05:04:15,030 --> 05:04:16,470
There's enough sabotage.

8556
05:04:16,530 --> 05:04:19,330
If we die, we die...

8557
05:04:19,330 --> 05:04:19,730
Natural causes.

8558
05:04:20,330 --> 05:04:22,470
Natural causes being...

8559
05:04:22,470 --> 05:04:23,610
Like a ghast.

8560
05:04:27,790 --> 05:04:30,910
Though, I will...

8561
05:04:30,910 --> 05:04:33,270
Build a...

8562
05:04:33,270 --> 05:04:34,370
A thing for me.

8563
05:04:34,590 --> 05:04:36,730
And have her face the...

8564
05:04:37,270 --> 05:04:38,950
Consequences of...

8565
05:04:38,950 --> 05:04:42,590
I think I'm going the right way.

8566
05:04:43,370 --> 05:04:46,030
She will have to fight for herself.

8567
05:04:46,470 --> 05:04:49,330
Against the night time terrors.

8568
05:04:51,610 --> 05:04:52,730
Drowning is natural.

8569
05:04:56,390 --> 05:04:57,830
It's beer o'clock.

8570
05:04:59,470 --> 05:05:01,650
Uh-oh, it's starting to get real dark.

8571
05:05:01,810 --> 05:05:02,050
Doki!

8572
05:05:03,550 --> 05:05:04,030
Doki!

8573
05:05:06,310 --> 05:05:06,790
Doki!

8574
05:05:08,170 --> 05:05:10,430
I don't know if I'm going the right way.

8575
05:05:11,190 --> 05:05:13,890
I haven't checked even a single one time.

8576
05:05:14,530 --> 05:05:16,730
Oh, so you're gonna try and kill me, huh?

8577
05:05:17,430 --> 05:05:18,550
I didn't say that.

8578
05:05:18,550 --> 05:05:20,150
Oh, you're gonna try and kill me.

8579
05:05:20,530 --> 05:05:22,890
I said that I will leave you to...

8580
05:05:23,690 --> 05:05:24,130
Yourself.

8581
05:05:24,450 --> 05:05:26,070
When the night time comes.

8582
05:05:26,250 --> 05:05:28,010
Oh, you're not even gonna try and protect me.

8583
05:05:28,110 --> 05:05:28,570
I see.

8584
05:05:30,370 --> 05:05:32,230
Am I in the right direction?

8585
05:05:32,490 --> 05:05:34,550
Wait, negative 4116?

8586
05:05:36,390 --> 05:05:37,090
Yeah, maybe.

8587
05:05:37,970 --> 05:05:38,570
What do you mean maybe?

8588
05:05:39,470 --> 05:05:40,670
Is that what it is?

8589
05:05:40,850 --> 05:05:42,110
What do you mean maybe?

8590
05:05:42,270 --> 05:05:45,350
Get off the boat, we need to sleep.

8591
05:05:45,350 --> 05:05:45,970
We need to sleep.

8592
05:05:46,490 --> 05:05:47,050
Okay.

8593
05:05:48,910 --> 05:05:51,450
The baby now about wanting to sleep, huh?

8594
05:05:52,030 --> 05:05:52,610
Oh, okay.

8595
05:05:52,830 --> 05:05:54,130
We don't need to sleep then.

8596
05:05:54,810 --> 05:05:57,130
Negative 4116, 1576.

8597
05:05:57,890 --> 05:05:58,670
I'm asleep.

8598
05:06:00,710 --> 05:06:02,350
And you still slept.

8599
05:06:05,690 --> 05:06:07,350
Alright, get over here.

8600
05:06:08,030 --> 05:06:08,770
Come on.

8601
05:06:09,070 --> 05:06:10,010
Hop on my boat.

8602
05:06:10,510 --> 05:06:12,850
So which way do I need to go?

8603
05:06:13,590 --> 05:06:15,130
1576 is the...

8604
05:06:15,130 --> 05:06:16,850
Negative 4116.

8605
05:06:19,030 --> 05:06:20,890
Do you think we can ask this guy for directions?

8606
05:06:21,950 --> 05:06:22,450
Sure.

8607
05:06:23,490 --> 05:06:25,330
Hello sir, do you...

8608
05:06:25,330 --> 05:06:28,230
Yes, Min was gonna drown you by breaking the boat.

8609
05:06:28,850 --> 05:06:31,190
I didn't say that, my chat suggested that.

8610
05:06:31,330 --> 05:06:32,230
You know who said that?

8611
05:06:33,030 --> 05:06:33,330
What?

8612
05:06:33,450 --> 05:06:34,750
Your favorite guy, Aragon.

8613
05:06:36,770 --> 05:06:39,110
This guy has no loyalty to anybody.

8614
05:06:40,190 --> 05:06:41,510
He's a professional snitch.

8615
05:06:41,510 --> 05:06:44,730
Oh my god.

8616
05:06:45,210 --> 05:06:46,710
He has no loyalty.

8617
05:06:47,950 --> 05:06:49,270
He's a professional snitch.

8618
05:06:56,670 --> 05:06:59,390
Guys, he's not even a wisp goon.

8619
05:07:00,350 --> 05:07:00,590
I know.

8620
05:07:00,590 --> 05:07:02,650
Is it an SSR?

8621
05:07:03,010 --> 05:07:03,650
Yeah.

8622
05:07:05,030 --> 05:07:05,950
SSRP.

8623
05:07:06,850 --> 05:07:07,450
SSRP?

8624
05:07:07,450 --> 05:07:08,050
What does that mean?

8625
05:07:08,610 --> 05:07:09,750
Supersized roleplay?

8626
05:07:12,010 --> 05:07:14,070
I can't believe supersized...

8627
05:07:14,070 --> 05:07:14,250
Am I going the right way?

8628
05:07:15,710 --> 05:07:16,910
Negative 144...

8629
05:07:16,910 --> 05:07:19,310
Stop telling me numbers and tell me directions.

8630
05:07:20,390 --> 05:07:22,070
I thought you were okay.

8631
05:07:22,670 --> 05:07:24,090
Oh my god, okay.

8632
05:07:24,330 --> 05:07:25,770
We're negative 49?

8633
05:07:33,010 --> 05:07:35,770
I thought you had your coordinates out.

8634
05:07:35,830 --> 05:07:37,770
No, that's why I gave them to you.

8635
05:07:37,850 --> 05:07:39,030
To be the navigator.

8636
05:07:39,030 --> 05:07:41,980
Get out.

8637
05:07:42,540 --> 05:07:44,520
Get off the fucking phone.

8638
05:07:44,700 --> 05:07:46,520
Get off the phone.

8639
05:07:46,960 --> 05:07:49,320
You're not allowed to speak.

8640
05:07:49,560 --> 05:07:52,140
Okay, while you direct, I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

8641
05:07:52,840 --> 05:07:53,480
Okay.

8642
05:07:55,260 --> 05:07:55,900
Okay.

8643
05:07:58,180 --> 05:08:02,660
Oh my god, we're way too ahead of going.

8644
05:08:04,340 --> 05:08:06,140
Oh my god, what was the coordinates?

8645
05:08:06,480 --> 05:08:09,480
Negative 4116.

8646
05:08:09,480 --> 05:08:11,100
Oh my god.

8647
05:08:11,140 --> 05:08:13,340
Where did she end up going?

8648
05:08:14,020 --> 05:08:15,480
Like, we're at 700.

8649
05:08:17,260 --> 05:08:19,740
Oh my god.

8650
05:08:20,100 --> 05:08:23,060
How do we get the 700?

8651
05:08:24,340 --> 05:08:26,960
How do I get out of here?

8652
05:08:27,180 --> 05:08:29,020
Okay, it's this one.

8653
05:08:29,880 --> 05:08:32,400
Try to reduce the numbers.

8654
05:08:32,560 --> 05:08:35,680
Oh my god.

8655
05:08:36,880 --> 05:08:37,160
Okay.

8656
05:08:37,160 --> 05:08:38,060
This...

8657
05:08:38,060 --> 05:08:42,700
How did she fucking get 600 coordinates away?

8658
05:08:44,840 --> 05:08:47,860
She just followed the coast.

8659
05:08:47,940 --> 05:08:50,080
What if I let her drown here?

8660
05:08:50,520 --> 05:08:52,500
What if I let her drown?

8661
05:08:54,940 --> 05:08:58,100
How's my GPU hitting 100 too?

8662
05:08:58,360 --> 05:08:59,820
Like, what is wrong with...

8663
05:08:59,820 --> 05:09:01,380
Oh, this Minecraft is too beautiful.

8664
05:09:01,900 --> 05:09:05,240
I think it's my resource pack.

8665
05:09:05,240 --> 05:09:06,240
Alright.

8666
05:09:07,000 --> 05:09:08,580
No, it's the right way.

8667
05:09:10,100 --> 05:09:11,220
Oh, 15...

8668
05:09:11,220 --> 05:09:13,360
Oh my god, it's 1576.

8669
05:09:13,680 --> 05:09:15,540
Oh my god, I'm fucking...

8670
05:09:15,540 --> 05:09:17,340
I'm losing it right now.

8671
05:09:17,620 --> 05:09:19,840
I'm reading them numbers wrong too.

8672
05:09:22,500 --> 05:09:24,380
Guys, no, you don't understand.

8673
05:09:24,520 --> 05:09:25,680
I'm losing it as well.

8674
05:09:26,840 --> 05:09:29,280
I'm losing it as well.

8675
05:09:29,280 --> 05:09:29,340
I'm losing it as well.

8676
05:09:32,780 --> 05:09:37,700
She took us so far that I fucking... I didn't even know where I was going at that point.

8677
05:09:38,000 --> 05:09:39,640
I've lost track as well.

8678
05:09:42,400 --> 05:09:44,040
Does this go down?

8679
05:09:44,960 --> 05:09:46,480
Which way goes down?

8680
05:09:48,240 --> 05:09:49,160
This way?

8681
05:09:56,170 --> 05:09:56,750
This way.

8682
05:09:57,010 --> 05:09:57,970
This goes down.

8683
05:09:58,410 --> 05:09:59,650
This way goes down.

8684
05:10:00,210 --> 05:10:00,810
Okay.

8685
05:10:04,920 --> 05:10:05,480
Okay.

8686
05:10:05,500 --> 05:10:06,000
Okay, that way.

8687
05:10:06,160 --> 05:10:07,360
Okay, we figured it out.

8688
05:10:07,860 --> 05:10:09,980
Sorry, I got, like, very lost.

8689
05:10:10,360 --> 05:10:15,020
She was getting further and further away from our destination.

8690
05:10:17,640 --> 05:10:21,160
Oh my god, what did I end up getting in my fucking inventory?

8691
05:10:25,950 --> 05:10:27,910
My god, where did she take us?

8692
05:10:28,550 --> 05:10:31,110
Where the fuck did she take us?

8693
05:10:31,870 --> 05:10:34,290
Where did you take us?

8694
05:10:36,330 --> 05:10:37,390
I'm following the edge of the world.

8695
05:10:37,590 --> 05:10:40,510
I thought me seeing the numbers was like...

8696
05:10:40,870 --> 05:10:43,190
I thought you had your M3 out.

8697
05:10:44,410 --> 05:10:45,890
No, that's why I gave you the numbers.

8698
05:10:46,370 --> 05:10:47,250
What do you want me to do?

8699
05:10:47,250 --> 05:10:47,550
Left?

8700
05:10:47,690 --> 05:10:47,910
Right?

8701
05:10:49,190 --> 05:10:49,670
Like...

8702
05:10:49,670 --> 05:10:50,730
Yeah, basically.

8703
05:10:51,630 --> 05:10:52,490
Oh my god.

8704
05:10:53,170 --> 05:10:55,650
I could hear you screaming while I was walking away.

8705
05:10:57,110 --> 05:10:58,090
From my headphones.

8706
05:11:00,910 --> 05:11:03,770
I don't even know where you took us anymore.

8707
05:11:03,770 --> 05:11:07,390
I'm trying to figure out this pathway.

8708
05:11:08,210 --> 05:11:11,170
Okay, I remember the savannah.

8709
05:11:12,970 --> 05:11:14,670
It's not the wrong way.

8710
05:11:14,730 --> 05:11:16,630
It's not the wrong way, guys.

8711
05:11:16,750 --> 05:11:21,750
I'm just trying to navigate this fucking hellhole that Mint took us through.

8712
05:11:22,250 --> 05:11:23,250
What were the coordinates again?

8713
05:11:25,190 --> 05:11:27,310
Negative 4, 1, 1, 6.

8714
05:11:27,670 --> 05:11:28,650
Alright, get off the boat.

8715
05:11:29,770 --> 05:11:30,970
Get off the boat.

8716
05:11:30,970 --> 05:11:32,050
Get off the boat.

8717
05:11:32,210 --> 05:11:32,730
We're fucking...

8718
05:11:32,730 --> 05:11:33,630
We're gonna walk now.

8719
05:11:35,270 --> 05:11:37,350
We've lost your...

8720
05:11:37,350 --> 05:11:38,290
Alright, here we go.

8721
05:11:39,830 --> 05:11:40,810
We're gonna walk.

8722
05:11:40,990 --> 05:11:42,970
4, 1, 1, 6 and...

8723
05:11:43,770 --> 05:11:44,490
What's the Z?

8724
05:11:46,170 --> 05:11:49,110
1, 4, 1, 5, 7, 6.

8725
05:11:49,330 --> 05:11:50,430
Oh, we're going the wrong way then.

8726
05:11:50,610 --> 05:11:51,290
Oh, this way.

8727
05:11:51,350 --> 05:11:51,950
Okay, this way.

8728
05:11:52,530 --> 05:11:53,190
We're not.

8729
05:11:54,970 --> 05:11:56,510
I was going the right way.

8730
05:11:57,270 --> 05:11:57,690
This way.

8731
05:11:58,510 --> 05:11:59,670
Yeah, my way.

8732
05:12:00,230 --> 05:12:01,110
Yeah, my way.

8733
05:12:01,310 --> 05:12:02,710
Oh my god, there's so many bunnies here.

8734
05:12:02,910 --> 05:12:03,290
My way.

8735
05:12:04,550 --> 05:12:05,450
No, my way.

8736
05:12:06,970 --> 05:12:07,750
Where are you?

8737
05:12:08,190 --> 05:12:10,910
I'm going my way.

8738
05:12:11,690 --> 05:12:13,850
We're both going the same direction, I assume.

8739
05:12:13,930 --> 05:12:15,390
Because we're both at the same coordinates.

8740
05:12:16,570 --> 05:12:16,890
Yeah.

8741
05:12:18,150 --> 05:12:19,950
Oh my god, are those cows on trees?

8742
05:12:20,810 --> 05:12:21,970
What are they doing up there?

8743
05:12:22,950 --> 05:12:23,870
I see you.

8744
05:12:23,970 --> 05:12:25,370
No, they're cows on the cliff.

8745
05:12:25,370 --> 05:12:27,030
They're cows on the cliff.

8746
05:12:27,730 --> 05:12:29,590
We're just having a good time.

8747
05:12:30,150 --> 05:12:30,590
Yeah.

8748
05:12:30,810 --> 05:12:31,990
Just like us.

8749
05:12:32,490 --> 05:12:32,830
Yeah.

8750
05:12:33,890 --> 05:12:34,370
Yeah.

8751
05:12:41,170 --> 05:12:44,190
Guys, she's gonna try and strangle me in a couple days.

8752
05:12:46,250 --> 05:12:47,970
Oh shit, I'm going the wrong way.

8753
05:12:48,790 --> 05:12:50,030
Why are you going the wrong way?

8754
05:12:50,930 --> 05:12:52,650
Oh my god, that was close!

8755
05:12:53,270 --> 05:12:54,650
I gamed over that.

8756
05:12:58,930 --> 05:12:59,410
Alright.

8757
05:13:01,310 --> 05:13:03,430
That's probably how I got lost in the first place.

8758
05:13:03,770 --> 05:13:06,350
Oh, now you have your F3 open.

8759
05:13:06,510 --> 05:13:10,030
Wow, when we're not using the boat, you have your F3 open.

8760
05:13:10,050 --> 05:13:12,450
Well, I can't drive and look at the F3 at the same time.

8761
05:13:12,470 --> 05:13:17,550
Oh yeah, guys, remember, don't Minecraft and drive at the same time, guys.

8762
05:13:18,250 --> 05:13:19,410
Don't read and drive.

8763
05:13:19,410 --> 05:13:19,450
Don't read and drive.

8764
05:13:20,570 --> 05:13:22,450
Aragon gave you a good report.

8765
05:13:24,710 --> 05:13:25,890
Oh yeah, what did he say?

8766
05:13:26,610 --> 05:13:27,750
He said you were good.

8767
05:13:28,310 --> 05:13:28,970
You were a good girl.

8768
05:13:29,230 --> 05:13:29,830
That's what he said.

8769
05:13:32,310 --> 05:13:33,810
Was I not a good girl?

8770
05:13:34,170 --> 05:13:35,890
What was your death threat against me?

8771
05:13:37,610 --> 05:13:39,370
I'm fucking taking the boat out.

8772
05:13:39,650 --> 05:13:41,590
I don't think you should phrase it like that.

8773
05:13:41,590 --> 05:13:42,010
Alright.

8774
05:13:47,630 --> 05:13:49,910
What was your death threat against me?

8775
05:13:50,090 --> 05:13:51,470
I'm taking the boat, goodbye.

8776
05:13:52,230 --> 05:13:53,690
Wait, what do you mean you're taking the boat?

8777
05:13:53,930 --> 05:13:55,750
I'm taking the boat, goodbye.

8778
05:13:56,370 --> 05:13:57,530
Why are you taking the boat?

8779
05:13:57,850 --> 05:13:58,530
Where are you?

8780
05:13:59,330 --> 05:14:02,710
We're gonna both be, make it to the same place anyway.

8781
05:14:03,550 --> 05:14:05,310
Okay, I'll just be a little longer.

8782
05:14:05,610 --> 05:14:06,970
Wait, what's the coordinates again?

8783
05:14:07,530 --> 05:14:14,270
4-1-1-6 1-5-7-6 1-5-7-6 So it's here.

8784
05:14:16,310 --> 05:14:18,190
1-5-7-6?

8785
05:14:18,390 --> 05:14:26,910
1-5-7-6 I thought it was 1-100-6 I thought it was 1-100-6 I thought it was 1-100-6 I was gonna...

8786
05:14:26,910 --> 05:14:27,790
I was gonna...

8787
05:14:30,750 --> 05:14:31,910
Well, we know.

8788
05:14:32,010 --> 05:14:33,250
Okay, alright.

8789
05:14:33,730 --> 05:14:35,350
Oh my god, can I take this bird home?

8790
05:14:36,770 --> 05:14:38,350
Did you go to the jungle?

8791
05:14:38,350 --> 05:14:41,030
Did you go to the jungle?

8792
05:14:41,210 --> 05:14:42,790
Are you at the jungle?

8793
05:14:43,350 --> 05:14:44,750
I'm about to leave the jungle.

8794
05:14:47,050 --> 05:14:49,770
I literally pulled a Patrick Star.

8795
05:14:55,890 --> 05:14:58,330
Why didn't you guys say something sooner?

8796
05:14:58,730 --> 05:14:59,930
I bet they were.

8797
05:15:00,210 --> 05:15:01,170
I bet they were.

8798
05:15:02,370 --> 05:15:04,330
Oh, I see the doggos again.

8799
05:15:04,950 --> 05:15:06,410
What was the coordinate?

8800
05:15:06,410 --> 05:15:11,470
Negative 4-1-1-6 I found the portal.

8801
05:15:12,170 --> 05:15:18,030
1-5-7-6 1-5-7-6 Oh, I'm a little far, okay.

8802
05:15:19,690 --> 05:15:20,530
I'll be there.

8803
05:15:20,650 --> 05:15:21,390
Oh my god.

8804
05:15:22,210 --> 05:15:22,890
Can I have the boat?

8805
05:15:25,530 --> 05:15:26,770
There's trees everywhere.

8806
05:15:28,070 --> 05:15:30,130
Was that something you said to me?

8807
05:15:30,230 --> 05:15:31,730
I was like, oh, you didn't get the boat.

8808
05:15:31,910 --> 05:15:33,390
Oh, there's trees everywhere.

8809
05:15:33,390 --> 05:15:36,390
That's literally what you told me.

8810
05:15:36,990 --> 05:15:39,190
I'm getting stuff to make books.

8811
05:15:39,390 --> 05:15:39,910
Just in case.

8812
05:15:41,690 --> 05:15:42,950
I'm doing my part.

8813
05:15:43,130 --> 05:15:44,550
I got my boat.

8814
05:15:46,510 --> 05:15:47,730
I was hungry.

8815
05:15:48,090 --> 05:15:49,530
I haven't had dinner.

8816
05:15:51,170 --> 05:15:52,030
I'm hungry.

8817
05:15:52,590 --> 05:15:54,710
We gotta sleep soon.

8818
05:15:55,450 --> 05:15:56,010
Okay.

8819
05:15:57,290 --> 05:15:59,630
Do we need to go back to the nether?

8820
05:16:03,430 --> 05:16:04,770
Probably to find a fortress.

8821
05:16:05,250 --> 05:16:07,230
Alright, I'm gonna put my stuff away then.

8822
05:16:07,410 --> 05:16:08,170
In this thing.

8823
05:16:09,330 --> 05:16:10,610
I'm gonna give you the spectral arrow.

8824
05:16:10,810 --> 05:16:12,570
I'm putting it in the chest so you can take it.

8825
05:16:12,930 --> 05:16:14,090
Okay, yeah, I'll use it.

8826
05:16:14,170 --> 05:16:15,690
You have the bow anyway.

8827
05:16:16,210 --> 05:16:17,230
Why don't you make a bow?

8828
05:16:17,530 --> 05:16:17,970
Just make one.

8829
05:16:19,770 --> 05:16:21,270
It becomes apex then.

8830
05:16:25,190 --> 05:16:25,990
I guess.

8831
05:16:27,390 --> 05:16:28,630
Oh my god.

8832
05:16:29,550 --> 05:16:30,550
Wait, okay.

8833
05:16:30,550 --> 05:16:31,990
I'm going to sleep.

8834
05:16:32,150 --> 05:16:33,230
I'm going to sleep too.

8835
05:16:34,390 --> 05:16:35,570
I'll go sleep.

8836
05:16:39,350 --> 05:16:39,930
Alright.

8837
05:16:43,230 --> 05:16:44,550
Where's my string?

8838
05:16:45,210 --> 05:16:46,350
Bow time.

8839
05:16:47,470 --> 05:16:48,970
Alright, I made my bow.

8840
05:16:49,970 --> 05:16:50,250
Nice.

8841
05:16:50,410 --> 05:16:52,270
I'm gonna put away...

8842
05:16:52,270 --> 05:16:53,450
I'm gonna put away some stuff.

8843
05:16:53,630 --> 05:16:56,950
Sugar cane, dirt, my water.

8844
05:16:57,750 --> 05:17:02,610
I don't need the water yet because the enderman hits the nether and water doesn't work.

8845
05:17:02,610 --> 05:17:04,070
Yeah, we only need it for the fight.

8846
05:17:04,970 --> 05:17:06,930
Yeah, and then...

8847
05:17:06,930 --> 05:17:08,050
I'll put the string away.

8848
05:17:08,570 --> 05:17:09,790
I'll put the soul speed.

8849
05:17:11,030 --> 05:17:12,010
I'm taking a bike.

8850
05:17:13,370 --> 05:17:14,750
Do we need the boat?

8851
05:17:14,950 --> 05:17:15,930
Do we need it?

8852
05:17:15,970 --> 05:17:16,730
I'll pick the boat.

8853
05:17:17,030 --> 05:17:17,770
Just in case we fall.

8854
05:17:18,990 --> 05:17:19,930
Just in case we fall.

8855
05:17:27,010 --> 05:17:28,530
Put the charge.

8856
05:17:29,390 --> 05:17:31,310
I took the blast furnace.

8857
05:17:32,370 --> 05:17:34,010
I put away the obsidian.

8858
05:17:39,210 --> 05:17:40,830
Oh, that sounds nice.

8859
05:17:41,330 --> 05:17:42,330
I haven't had dinner yet.

8860
05:17:44,010 --> 05:17:45,310
Let's have it later.

8861
05:17:46,130 --> 05:17:47,650
It's kind of late for dinner for me.

8862
05:17:47,830 --> 05:17:50,890
Oh yeah, you're not west coast.

8863
05:17:53,770 --> 05:17:55,130
What did I want to...

8864
05:17:55,130 --> 05:17:56,930
Oh, my brain is short circuiting.

8865
05:17:57,170 --> 05:17:57,910
Oh, I see the PP tower.

8866
05:17:58,370 --> 05:18:00,270
My brain isn't working anymore.

8867
05:18:00,390 --> 05:18:01,570
What did I want to make?

8868
05:18:01,810 --> 05:18:03,450
What did I want to make again?

8869
05:18:03,890 --> 05:18:06,030
No, I have the spectral arrows.

8870
05:18:06,390 --> 05:18:08,850
What did I want to make?

8871
05:18:11,110 --> 05:18:12,470
Guys, what was it?

8872
05:18:12,570 --> 05:18:14,090
I don't remember in my head.

8873
05:18:14,390 --> 05:18:16,810
There's a lot of sheep around here, so I'm going to murder them.

8874
05:18:17,670 --> 05:18:18,550
Oh, wait.

8875
05:18:18,670 --> 05:18:19,950
Gold bars.

8876
05:18:21,030 --> 05:18:21,210
Yes.

8877
05:18:21,210 --> 05:18:21,330
Yes.

8878
05:18:24,030 --> 05:18:25,510
Let's murder sheep.

8879
05:18:27,370 --> 05:18:29,230
Down with sheep.

8880
05:18:30,090 --> 05:18:31,310
Alright, I'm ready.

8881
05:18:31,550 --> 05:18:31,950
Why are you already dying?

8882
05:18:32,330 --> 05:18:32,890
I'm ready.

8883
05:18:35,190 --> 05:18:37,770
What do you mean already dying?

8884
05:18:38,250 --> 05:18:38,890
Hold on.

8885
05:18:39,890 --> 05:18:41,810
I'm going to put my stuff away first.

8886
05:18:42,130 --> 05:18:42,430
Alright.

8887
05:18:43,510 --> 05:18:44,890
You're not even here.

8888
05:18:45,590 --> 05:18:46,450
I am.

8889
05:18:46,450 --> 05:18:47,230
No, you're not.

8890
05:18:48,090 --> 05:18:48,850
I see you.

8891
05:18:49,270 --> 05:18:50,090
I don't see you.

8892
05:18:50,790 --> 05:18:53,130
Oh, I thought you meant next to me.

8893
05:18:53,190 --> 05:18:55,690
I thought you were at the chest.

8894
05:18:56,050 --> 05:18:56,750
Yeah, I'm here.

8895
05:18:58,190 --> 05:18:59,610
We're putting the lapis away, right?

8896
05:18:59,810 --> 05:19:01,290
Yeah, we don't need it now.

8897
05:19:03,390 --> 05:19:04,770
Oh, I guess I could've thrown that out.

8898
05:19:05,850 --> 05:19:07,050
Let's grab some food.

8899
05:19:07,110 --> 05:19:08,030
How much food do you have?

8900
05:19:08,110 --> 05:19:10,030
I have a lot of hay.

8901
05:19:11,210 --> 05:19:12,810
Bread is not fast.

8902
05:19:12,810 --> 05:19:14,550
I think we need something faster than hay.

8903
05:19:15,270 --> 05:19:15,990
We're fine.

8904
05:19:17,830 --> 05:19:18,490
It's fine.

8905
05:19:19,610 --> 05:19:20,410
It's fine.

8906
05:19:20,510 --> 05:19:21,110
I have golden carrots.

8907
05:19:21,950 --> 05:19:23,410
There's a bunch of sheep right here.

8908
05:19:23,430 --> 05:19:24,090
I have golden carrots.

8909
05:19:27,350 --> 05:19:27,890
How many?

8910
05:19:28,470 --> 05:19:29,310
Enough for me.

8911
05:19:29,890 --> 05:19:30,750
Okay, that's you.

8912
05:19:31,670 --> 05:19:34,210
I have lots of bread, but...

8913
05:19:34,210 --> 05:19:35,670
I need more substance.

8914
05:19:35,870 --> 05:19:36,810
I'm a growing girl.

8915
05:19:37,730 --> 05:19:39,070
I'm pretty sure you stopped growing.

8916
05:19:43,210 --> 05:19:45,710
Oh my god, I almost fell into this hole.

8917
05:19:45,910 --> 05:19:46,990
Careful of holes.

8918
05:19:47,950 --> 05:19:49,310
Oh no, I'm gonna fall in.

8919
05:19:52,830 --> 05:19:54,470
No response to that?

8920
05:20:03,610 --> 05:20:05,810
I'm taking my aggressions out on the sheep.

8921
05:20:06,350 --> 05:20:06,790
No.

8922
05:20:08,110 --> 05:20:09,350
I'm gonna get a mod.

8923
05:20:09,430 --> 05:20:11,130
I'm gonna get my own resource pack.

8924
05:20:11,130 --> 05:20:13,930
Where every sheep has a doki bird face on it.

8925
05:20:14,030 --> 05:20:17,110
There's some fucking Napoleon complex right there.

8926
05:20:19,130 --> 05:20:23,970
Sorry, some of us are not born to be stretched out.

8927
05:20:25,410 --> 05:20:26,430
Some of us...

8928
05:20:27,130 --> 05:20:30,050
Some of us have short moms and dads.

8929
05:20:30,250 --> 05:20:31,190
I'm 5'2".

8930
05:20:31,690 --> 05:20:32,930
What do you mean?

8931
05:20:35,170 --> 05:20:37,570
You're only 5'2".

8932
05:20:37,570 --> 05:20:39,750
And you're giving me shit.

8933
05:20:39,750 --> 05:20:41,530
Well, I...

8934
05:20:41,530 --> 05:20:44,130
I remember looking down.

8935
05:20:44,490 --> 05:20:51,130
I remember looking down.

8936
05:20:51,250 --> 05:20:53,370
That's all I'm gonna say.

8937
05:20:59,490 --> 05:21:01,570
I'm gonna wear my tallest shoes.

8938
05:21:02,010 --> 05:21:03,150
When I see you.

8939
05:21:12,660 --> 05:21:14,160
The blast furnace.

8940
05:21:14,380 --> 05:21:15,860
You want me to put it up now?

8941
05:21:16,420 --> 05:21:16,520
No.

8942
05:21:16,740 --> 05:21:19,700
The blast furnace only works for...

8943
05:21:19,700 --> 05:21:21,500
It only works for...

8944
05:21:22,320 --> 05:21:22,860
What's it called?

8945
05:21:22,880 --> 05:21:23,900
I have leather too.

8946
05:21:25,540 --> 05:21:26,700
Wanna use it?

8947
05:21:27,920 --> 05:21:28,220
What?

8948
05:21:28,520 --> 05:21:29,160
Blast furnace.

8949
05:21:29,980 --> 05:21:31,220
I'm putting a blast furnace here.

8950
05:21:31,460 --> 05:21:32,160
Just in case.

8951
05:21:36,310 --> 05:21:37,670
Wait, does it not work on me?

8952
05:21:37,830 --> 05:21:38,630
Oh, it doesn't.

8953
05:21:38,630 --> 05:21:40,890
Yeah, it only works on stuff.

8954
05:21:41,210 --> 05:21:42,330
Like I took all...

8955
05:21:42,330 --> 05:21:44,570
Oh wait, there's another furnace here.

8956
05:21:44,630 --> 05:21:45,110
I was gonna say.

8957
05:21:45,830 --> 05:21:46,690
I only took one.

8958
05:21:48,230 --> 05:21:49,850
I'll put the meat in here too.

8959
05:21:55,990 --> 05:21:57,850
Oh, the furnace is so slow.

8960
05:22:04,930 --> 05:22:05,930
You can...

8961
05:22:05,930 --> 05:22:09,670
Guys, this is not about how perfect the stacking is.

8962
05:22:09,750 --> 05:22:11,230
You already saw my inventory.

8963
05:22:11,610 --> 05:22:12,570
It's not great.

8964
05:22:15,050 --> 05:22:17,030
Yeah, we're here for...

8965
05:22:17,030 --> 05:22:18,130
For survival, not style.

8966
05:22:18,130 --> 05:22:19,170
Yeah, this is survival.

8967
05:22:19,330 --> 05:22:20,710
I put the ender pearl away too.

8968
05:22:21,290 --> 05:22:21,730
Okay.

8969
05:22:24,600 --> 05:22:26,200
Oh, it bothers you?

8970
05:22:27,740 --> 05:22:28,760
Don't worry.

8971
05:22:28,880 --> 05:22:29,820
I'll make it worse.

8972
05:22:33,100 --> 05:22:35,020
I can make it...

8973
05:22:35,020 --> 05:22:36,700
I can make it worse.

8974
05:22:38,120 --> 05:22:39,200
Oh my...

8975
05:22:39,200 --> 05:22:40,460
Oh yeah, my gold.

8976
05:22:44,260 --> 05:22:44,880
Gold.

8977
05:22:45,640 --> 05:22:46,580
More gold.

8978
05:22:47,120 --> 05:22:48,380
Gold, gold, gold.

8979
05:22:48,460 --> 05:22:50,080
How many gold nuggies do you have?

8980
05:22:50,120 --> 05:22:50,780
I have eight.

8981
05:22:51,060 --> 05:22:51,520
Do you have more?

8982
05:22:51,580 --> 05:22:53,920
I can make another gold bar.

8983
05:22:54,560 --> 05:22:54,960
Here you go.

8984
05:23:03,580 --> 05:23:05,300
Okay, I have four bars now.

8985
05:23:05,840 --> 05:23:06,140
Okay.

8986
05:23:08,580 --> 05:23:09,060
Nice.

8987
05:23:10,320 --> 05:23:11,140
Oh, sorry.

8988
05:23:11,420 --> 05:23:13,020
Oh my god, that sounded like...

8989
05:23:13,020 --> 05:23:15,540
That sounded like when the experience...

8990
05:23:15,540 --> 05:23:16,940
When you get the experience.

8991
05:23:26,730 --> 05:23:27,170
Alright.

8992
05:23:28,250 --> 05:23:29,370
One last meat.

8993
05:23:29,510 --> 05:23:30,490
Alright, nice.

8994
05:23:30,730 --> 05:23:31,410
Alright, I'm ready.

8995
05:23:32,370 --> 05:23:33,290
I'm ready to go to hell.

8996
05:23:34,730 --> 05:23:35,610
I'm ready.

8997
05:23:36,230 --> 05:23:39,350
Oh my god, my helmet is not doing so hot.

8998
05:23:39,370 --> 05:23:40,250
What are we doing again?

8999
05:23:40,410 --> 05:23:41,430
Find the fortress, right?

9000
05:23:42,930 --> 05:23:43,370
Right?

9001
05:23:43,750 --> 05:23:44,530
Is that our goal?

9002
05:23:46,030 --> 05:23:46,470
Yes.

9003
05:23:47,450 --> 05:23:47,890
Alright.

9004
05:23:48,730 --> 05:23:50,290
I'm gonna make another shield.

9005
05:23:51,050 --> 05:23:52,490
Okay, what's the...

9006
05:23:52,490 --> 05:23:53,250
Oh, my shield is okay.

9007
05:23:53,330 --> 05:23:54,350
I have not used it.

9008
05:23:55,410 --> 05:23:56,870
I'm just having one just in case.

9009
05:23:57,230 --> 05:23:59,870
Because, you know, there will be a lot of blocking from the...

9010
05:23:59,870 --> 05:24:00,570
What's it called?

9011
05:24:00,650 --> 05:24:01,230
As well.

9012
05:24:01,610 --> 05:24:02,250
For the gas?

9013
05:24:03,030 --> 05:24:05,550
Not the gas, the blazes.

9014
05:24:06,010 --> 05:24:07,350
Oh, you're right, you're right.

9015
05:24:08,510 --> 05:24:09,890
Are you farming trees?

9016
05:24:10,510 --> 05:24:12,870
Yeah, I'm gonna get another tree so I can...

9017
05:24:12,870 --> 05:24:13,250
Alright.

9018
05:24:13,910 --> 05:24:15,250
I'm gonna wait here.

9019
05:24:15,630 --> 05:24:17,310
And contemplate my life.

9020
05:24:18,830 --> 05:24:19,750
Good night!

9021
05:24:19,870 --> 05:24:21,010
How did I get here?

9022
05:24:25,150 --> 05:24:25,510
Alright.

9023
05:24:27,550 --> 05:24:28,550
Alright, I'm ready.

9024
05:24:29,110 --> 05:24:31,350
You don't get burned if you...

9025
05:24:31,350 --> 05:24:32,550
Block it with a shield?

9026
05:24:32,790 --> 05:24:34,110
I think so, yeah.

9027
05:24:34,470 --> 05:24:37,570
Unless they changed that in the update, but it didn't used to be that case.

9028
05:24:38,250 --> 05:24:40,310
It's been a while since we fought blazes.

9029
05:24:41,250 --> 05:24:43,130
I know, apparently they've changed so much.

9030
05:24:43,530 --> 05:24:45,310
Yeah, I mean, they have camels now.

9031
05:24:46,510 --> 05:24:47,570
That's fucking wild.

9032
05:24:48,950 --> 05:24:49,430
Okay.

9033
05:24:49,430 --> 05:24:51,430
I played during camels.

9034
05:24:52,270 --> 05:24:52,810
Oh, okay.

9035
05:24:53,050 --> 05:24:54,210
So you have no excuse.

9036
05:24:55,590 --> 05:24:57,670
What's some potions for the fire?

9037
05:24:58,310 --> 05:24:59,270
Do I have gold helmet?

9038
05:24:59,390 --> 05:24:59,950
Yes, nice.

9039
05:25:00,330 --> 05:25:01,170
Gotcha time!

9040
05:25:04,070 --> 05:25:05,350
There's some gotcha!

9041
05:25:06,710 --> 05:25:07,930
It's gotcha time!

9042
05:25:08,270 --> 05:25:10,350
This is a dangerous area to do gotcha.

9043
05:25:10,630 --> 05:25:11,670
What are you gonna do?

9044
05:25:11,770 --> 05:25:12,430
Kill me?

9045
05:25:13,050 --> 05:25:13,990
Oh my god.

9046
05:25:14,570 --> 05:25:15,010
Gotcha!

9047
05:25:15,010 --> 05:25:15,470
Gotcha!

9048
05:25:18,290 --> 05:25:19,790
Got more arrows.

9049
05:25:21,590 --> 05:25:22,030
Gotcha!

9050
05:25:23,570 --> 05:25:24,050
Nether wart?

9051
05:25:24,150 --> 05:25:25,130
Oh, I have a nether wart.

9052
05:25:25,530 --> 05:25:26,970
Oh no, sorry, I have warp fungus.

9053
05:25:27,170 --> 05:25:28,110
Oh, what's the nether wart?

9054
05:25:29,190 --> 05:25:30,270
Is that the brown one?

9055
05:25:30,630 --> 05:25:31,950
Oh my god.

9056
05:25:32,730 --> 05:25:34,510
Is it soul speed again?

9057
05:25:34,750 --> 05:25:35,670
God damn it.

9058
05:25:36,250 --> 05:25:37,730
It's soul speed again.

9059
05:25:38,510 --> 05:25:39,070
What the hell?

9060
05:25:39,130 --> 05:25:40,270
He gave me a water bottle.

9061
05:25:40,370 --> 05:25:40,950
This guy sucks.

9062
05:25:42,670 --> 05:25:43,630
Stay hydrated!

9063
05:25:44,070 --> 05:25:45,670
Stay hydrated, guys!

9064
05:25:49,450 --> 05:25:50,790
He gave you string.

9065
05:25:51,810 --> 05:25:52,850
He gave you string.

9066
05:25:53,490 --> 05:25:54,670
Yeah, and you're giving me string?

9067
05:25:55,310 --> 05:25:57,250
That's literally the string he gave you.

9068
05:26:01,430 --> 05:26:02,210
Oh my god.

9069
05:26:02,350 --> 05:26:03,130
He gave you gravel.

9070
05:26:04,370 --> 05:26:04,610
Yeah.

9071
05:26:05,370 --> 05:26:06,430
Come on, I have more.

9072
05:26:07,050 --> 05:26:07,550
Come on.

9073
05:26:09,410 --> 05:26:11,090
Wait, did I take it?

9074
05:26:11,090 --> 05:26:11,610
Let's go gambling.

9075
05:26:11,750 --> 05:26:12,670
Did you take it?

9076
05:26:12,790 --> 05:26:14,030
No, you took it.

9077
05:26:15,450 --> 05:26:16,610
Let's go gambling.

9078
05:26:17,410 --> 05:26:18,730
Pig snorts enviously.

9079
05:26:19,190 --> 05:26:21,390
Well, yeah, to be fair, water is rare in the nether.

9080
05:26:21,830 --> 05:26:22,870
That's like his diamond.

9081
05:26:24,510 --> 05:26:25,250
Oh, there's two.

9082
05:26:26,470 --> 05:26:28,890
You didn't give both of them at the same time.

9083
05:26:32,920 --> 05:26:33,640
Come on.

9084
05:26:34,140 --> 05:26:35,020
Oh, he gave me a firetruck.

9085
05:26:35,040 --> 05:26:36,240
A double whammy.

9086
05:26:38,320 --> 05:26:39,080
What did he give you?

9087
05:26:39,080 --> 05:26:40,600
Oh my god, I got leather at least.

9088
05:26:40,720 --> 05:26:41,460
Oh, that's good.

9089
05:26:42,840 --> 05:26:43,940
You have more gold?

9090
05:26:44,940 --> 05:26:45,460
Come here.

9091
05:26:45,680 --> 05:26:47,640
Yeah, I have three more.

9092
05:26:48,540 --> 05:26:49,820
Throw another one.

9093
05:26:49,920 --> 05:26:50,560
They're greedy.

9094
05:26:50,780 --> 05:26:54,380
Oh my god.

9095
05:26:59,280 --> 05:27:00,320
I missed.

9096
05:27:01,040 --> 05:27:02,840
I know, it's really easy to miss.

9097
05:27:03,380 --> 05:27:04,260
Oh my god.

9098
05:27:05,500 --> 05:27:06,680
What the fuck?

9099
05:27:06,760 --> 05:27:08,040
What's the drop off?

9100
05:27:09,160 --> 05:27:09,920
Oh my god.

9101
05:27:10,920 --> 05:27:12,120
What's the drop off?

9102
05:27:13,380 --> 05:27:14,180
Okay, there you go.

9103
05:27:14,180 --> 05:27:14,660
I got it.

9104
05:27:15,900 --> 05:27:17,420
Okay, I figured out the drop off.

9105
05:27:17,480 --> 05:27:19,380
I figured it out.

9106
05:27:20,020 --> 05:27:23,080
I don't even know what they gave us.

9107
05:27:23,540 --> 05:27:24,900
I figured out the drop off.

9108
05:27:25,740 --> 05:27:26,720
Blackstone and gravel.

9109
05:27:28,560 --> 05:27:29,220
Oh, okay.

9110
05:27:29,340 --> 05:27:30,020
Because I got it.

9111
05:27:30,940 --> 05:27:31,100
Boo!

9112
05:27:32,740 --> 05:27:33,140
Boo!

9113
05:27:33,840 --> 05:27:34,340
Boo!

9114
05:27:35,500 --> 05:27:37,320
I'm throwing it away.

9115
05:27:38,100 --> 05:27:38,600
Boo!

9116
05:27:39,520 --> 05:27:39,800
Okay.

9117
05:27:40,720 --> 05:27:43,180
Alright, let's find this fucking stupid fortress.

9118
05:27:44,160 --> 05:27:44,540
Okay.

9119
05:27:45,020 --> 05:27:45,880
Alright, you lead.

9120
05:27:46,680 --> 05:27:46,980
Me?

9121
05:27:47,540 --> 05:27:48,040
Yes.

9122
05:27:49,380 --> 05:27:50,240
Okay, hold on.

9123
05:27:51,900 --> 05:27:54,300
Yes, because if we die, I can blame it on you.

9124
05:27:54,680 --> 05:27:56,480
Sure, I knew that would be the case.

9125
05:27:56,700 --> 05:27:57,000
Yeah.

9126
05:27:57,880 --> 05:27:58,740
It's good that you know.

9127
05:27:58,740 --> 05:28:01,460
Wait, so these are the ones that we need.

9128
05:28:01,720 --> 05:28:02,380
Are these the ones?

9129
05:28:03,200 --> 05:28:04,860
They are red mushrooms.

9130
05:28:05,060 --> 05:28:05,400
No, they're not.

9131
05:28:05,480 --> 05:28:06,240
They're red mushrooms.

9132
05:28:06,680 --> 05:28:07,780
He's shooting at us.

9133
05:28:08,000 --> 05:28:08,380
Where?

9134
05:28:10,440 --> 05:28:11,760
I don't even see the guy.

9135
05:28:12,120 --> 05:28:12,620
Just go up.

9136
05:28:12,800 --> 05:28:13,720
He's right behind you.

9137
05:28:14,960 --> 05:28:15,860
He's right behind you.

9138
05:28:15,860 --> 05:28:16,840
That's fine, let's just go.

9139
05:28:18,460 --> 05:28:20,600
Oh my god, this area sucks.

9140
05:28:23,860 --> 05:28:25,180
Alright, I'm climbing up.

9141
05:28:25,720 --> 05:28:26,080
Me too.

9142
05:28:28,740 --> 05:28:29,940
What about these ones?

9143
05:28:31,540 --> 05:28:32,820
Those are the mushrooms?

9144
05:28:33,360 --> 05:28:34,620
Oh, they're not the mushrooms.

9145
05:28:34,720 --> 05:28:35,340
I'm confused.

9146
05:28:36,380 --> 05:28:37,140
What the?

9147
05:28:38,180 --> 05:28:39,120
I fucked up.

9148
05:28:42,660 --> 05:28:43,720
I fucked up.

9149
05:28:44,560 --> 05:28:46,660
Um, I can't help you.

9150
05:28:47,040 --> 05:28:48,120
Is he following me?

9151
05:28:48,480 --> 05:28:49,920
Oh, he's still following me.

9152
05:28:50,300 --> 05:28:51,680
Oh, I'm so sorry.

9153
05:28:51,820 --> 05:28:52,100
Please.

9154
05:28:52,800 --> 05:28:53,600
Oh, he stopped.

9155
05:28:53,720 --> 05:28:53,980
He stopped.

9156
05:28:54,040 --> 05:28:54,460
He stopped.

9157
05:28:55,180 --> 05:28:55,860
He stopped.

9158
05:28:56,040 --> 05:28:56,280
Okay.

9159
05:28:57,500 --> 05:28:58,980
Oh, let's just keep going, I guess.

9160
05:28:59,160 --> 05:29:00,200
It was just a prank, bro.

9161
05:29:00,460 --> 05:29:02,520
It was just a prank, bro.

9162
05:29:03,460 --> 05:29:04,960
I'm sorry, bro.

9163
05:29:05,400 --> 05:29:06,120
Maybe we should go back.

9164
05:29:06,840 --> 05:29:08,220
Oh, this is so bad.

9165
05:29:08,320 --> 05:29:10,040
What's the easiest way to find a fortress?

9166
05:29:10,160 --> 05:29:11,280
There's no easy way.

9167
05:29:11,620 --> 05:29:12,880
There's no easy way.

9168
05:29:14,380 --> 05:29:15,680
We just go.

9169
05:29:15,980 --> 05:29:17,440
Wait, is he still angry?

9170
05:29:17,600 --> 05:29:18,980
What did I do to you?

9171
05:29:19,580 --> 05:29:20,800
Did you take his gold?

9172
05:29:21,160 --> 05:29:21,600
No.

9173
05:29:22,360 --> 05:29:24,220
Here, let's just dig through here.

9174
05:29:25,200 --> 05:29:25,680
No.

9175
05:29:26,880 --> 05:29:27,700
You get lucky.

9176
05:29:28,020 --> 05:29:28,580
This sucks.

9177
05:29:28,860 --> 05:29:29,320
Okay, hold on.

9178
05:29:30,000 --> 05:29:31,380
It's all about luck, isn't it?

9179
05:29:31,920 --> 05:29:32,660
I think so.

9180
05:29:33,720 --> 05:29:34,740
I'm just gonna climb up.

9181
05:29:35,500 --> 05:29:36,720
I'm putting a thing here.

9182
05:29:38,040 --> 05:29:38,480
Oh my god.

9183
05:29:38,780 --> 05:29:39,380
I hear him.

9184
05:29:39,860 --> 05:29:40,400
I hear him.

9185
05:29:41,800 --> 05:29:43,840
What if we dig into lava?

9186
05:29:45,260 --> 05:29:46,340
We don't do that.

9187
05:29:46,560 --> 05:29:48,020
We be very careful.

9188
05:29:48,700 --> 05:29:49,760
We keep our distance.

9189
05:29:49,760 --> 05:29:50,880
We keep our distance.

9190
05:29:51,100 --> 05:29:53,080
What if I'm not lucky?

9191
05:29:54,660 --> 05:29:55,660
Where are you going?

9192
05:29:56,360 --> 05:29:56,860
Gold.

9193
05:29:59,760 --> 05:30:00,880
He doesn't know.

9194
05:30:02,120 --> 05:30:03,380
He's already aggroed.

9195
05:30:03,480 --> 05:30:04,400
How does he know?

9196
05:30:06,000 --> 05:30:06,900
Do we have to go up?

9197
05:30:07,760 --> 05:30:08,500
Go up?

9198
05:30:08,620 --> 05:30:09,720
Yeah, because it's a mountain.

9199
05:30:11,440 --> 05:30:12,440
It was a mountain.

9200
05:30:14,080 --> 05:30:14,780
I saw it.

9201
05:30:14,880 --> 05:30:15,480
We have to go up.

9202
05:30:16,060 --> 05:30:17,600
I don't think we have to go up.

9203
05:30:17,600 --> 05:30:19,360
I just went across.

9204
05:30:19,660 --> 05:30:20,620
I'm digging up.

9205
05:30:20,720 --> 05:30:21,620
You can go across.

9206
05:30:21,820 --> 05:30:22,440
I dig up.

9207
05:30:23,160 --> 05:30:23,880
Don't dig up.

9208
05:30:23,940 --> 05:30:24,520
Don't dig up.

9209
05:30:26,360 --> 05:30:27,420
It's a full lava.

9210
05:30:32,540 --> 05:30:33,020
Wow.

9211
05:30:33,020 --> 05:30:33,280
Wow.

9212
05:30:44,810 --> 05:30:51,010
I thought it was...

9213
05:30:51,010 --> 05:30:51,790
I don't know.

9214
05:30:51,930 --> 05:30:53,330
I thought it was a mountain.

9215
05:30:53,670 --> 05:30:54,990
I thought it was a...

9216
05:30:54,990 --> 05:30:56,050
Why are you down here?

9217
05:30:56,970 --> 05:30:58,310
Because we're going through.

9218
05:30:59,070 --> 05:30:59,470
Okay.

9219
05:30:59,890 --> 05:31:00,330
Hold on.

9220
05:31:01,290 --> 05:31:02,950
I learned my lesson from before.

9221
05:31:03,790 --> 05:31:04,850
I learned my lesson.

9222
05:31:04,950 --> 05:31:05,230
Hold on.

9223
05:31:06,050 --> 05:31:06,490
Wait.

9224
05:31:07,130 --> 05:31:08,170
Do you have nuggies?

9225
05:31:08,190 --> 05:31:08,590
Yeah.

9226
05:31:10,690 --> 05:31:11,970
I learned my lesson.

9227
05:31:13,090 --> 05:31:13,530
Okay.

9228
05:31:13,930 --> 05:31:15,190
Let's just keep going this way.

9229
05:31:15,490 --> 05:31:17,670
Because we're about to get to another soul area.

9230
05:31:17,930 --> 05:31:18,810
So it might be in here.

9231
05:31:19,330 --> 05:31:20,290
I heard like gas.

9232
05:31:21,570 --> 05:31:22,190
Hold on.

9233
05:31:22,290 --> 05:31:24,410
I'm going to put some torches down.

9234
05:31:25,790 --> 05:31:27,530
As a way to find our way home.

9235
05:31:28,810 --> 05:31:29,830
What's that sound?

9236
05:31:29,830 --> 05:31:31,090
Is that gas?

9237
05:31:31,770 --> 05:31:32,430
The meowing?

9238
05:31:32,610 --> 05:31:33,370
Yeah, it's a gas.

9239
05:31:34,610 --> 05:31:35,650
He's like...

9240
05:31:35,650 --> 05:31:37,170
Yeah, that's what he does.

9241
05:31:37,250 --> 05:31:37,790
He's nasty.

9242
05:31:38,550 --> 05:31:41,850
Yeah, now imagine him being all filled with skin and...

9243
05:31:43,030 --> 05:31:46,350
The skin and like little hairs coming out too.

9244
05:31:47,410 --> 05:31:49,050
Wait, where is my...

9245
05:31:49,850 --> 05:31:51,470
How did you get over there?

9246
05:31:52,030 --> 05:31:53,350
This is where my hole's at.

9247
05:31:55,210 --> 05:31:56,630
Why are you above me?

9248
05:31:57,470 --> 05:31:57,830
Hold on.

9249
05:31:57,830 --> 05:31:58,810
Don't follow me.

9250
05:31:59,630 --> 05:32:00,750
It's too late.

9251
05:32:01,130 --> 05:32:02,110
I'm going to not listen.

9252
05:32:02,450 --> 05:32:03,950
We're going down through here.

9253
05:32:11,970 --> 05:32:13,970
What if I dig up again?

9254
05:32:14,590 --> 05:32:15,670
You could die.

9255
05:32:16,790 --> 05:32:18,110
Wouldn't that be a shame?

9256
05:32:19,590 --> 05:32:22,430
It sounds like you want to not do this.

9257
05:32:22,730 --> 05:32:24,710
Or rather you want to do this forever.

9258
05:32:33,170 --> 05:32:35,830
It took us 5 hours to get to this point.

9259
05:32:35,910 --> 05:32:38,210
I don't know how many hours it's going to take us forever.

9260
05:32:38,210 --> 05:32:42,730
This is why it took other people literally 20 days.

9261
05:32:43,010 --> 05:32:43,730
20 days.

9262
05:32:44,370 --> 05:32:45,670
Oh, I'm in the soul sand.

9263
05:32:46,070 --> 05:32:47,070
This might be good.

9264
05:32:47,670 --> 05:32:48,610
Oh, I hear a gas.

9265
05:32:48,670 --> 05:32:49,490
Nevermind, that's not good.

9266
05:32:50,070 --> 05:32:50,790
We can fight him.

9267
05:32:51,570 --> 05:32:52,550
He'll disappear eventually.

9268
05:32:54,170 --> 05:32:55,010
Oh my god.

9269
05:32:55,990 --> 05:32:56,870
I hate them.

9270
05:32:57,710 --> 05:32:58,150
Meow.

9271
05:32:58,890 --> 05:32:59,330
Meow.

9272
05:33:00,210 --> 05:33:00,650
Meow.

9273
05:33:02,250 --> 05:33:03,270
Where is he?

9274
05:33:03,630 --> 05:33:04,870
Oh, there's the bones.

9275
05:33:05,110 --> 05:33:06,870
Look at all these bones.

9276
05:33:07,350 --> 05:33:08,490
Yeah, we're in the bone zone.

9277
05:33:13,700 --> 05:33:15,280
Who the fuck is this guy?

9278
05:33:16,300 --> 05:33:16,800
I don't know.

9279
05:33:16,820 --> 05:33:18,760
I hear him, but I don't see him anywhere.

9280
05:33:19,280 --> 05:33:20,500
He might be above us.

9281
05:33:25,070 --> 05:33:26,870
I don't want to leave until he's gone though.

9282
05:33:30,110 --> 05:33:31,970
I don't think he's going to go away.

9283
05:33:37,140 --> 05:33:38,640
I don't think...

9284
05:33:44,830 --> 05:33:46,510
I don't hear them anymore.

9285
05:33:46,910 --> 05:33:47,670
I don't either.

9286
05:33:47,950 --> 05:33:48,530
I think we're good.

9287
05:33:48,730 --> 05:33:49,270
Yeah, we're good.

9288
05:33:49,530 --> 05:33:50,430
Can we go down?

9289
05:33:51,150 --> 05:33:51,510
Yeah.

9290
05:33:52,470 --> 05:33:52,990
Okay.

9291
05:33:54,350 --> 05:33:54,870
No.

9292
05:33:55,570 --> 05:33:56,730
Go to the jump.

9293
05:33:57,110 --> 05:33:59,130
We can build a ladder.

9294
05:34:00,990 --> 05:34:01,510
Staircase.

9295
05:34:02,290 --> 05:34:02,990
We can try.

9296
05:34:04,030 --> 05:34:05,050
Oh, oh, oh.

9297
05:34:07,460 --> 05:34:08,160
Hold on.

9298
05:34:09,260 --> 05:34:09,980
There we go.

9299
05:34:10,140 --> 05:34:11,100
Okay, we can start from here.

9300
05:34:11,100 --> 05:34:12,300
Oh, okay.

9301
05:34:12,340 --> 05:34:13,120
We'll start from here.

9302
05:34:13,200 --> 05:34:13,480
Okay.

9303
05:34:13,620 --> 05:34:15,580
I was already making my own, but okay.

9304
05:34:15,760 --> 05:34:16,280
Oh, just kidding.

9305
05:34:16,460 --> 05:34:18,060
Alright, that's fine.

9306
05:34:23,050 --> 05:34:25,670
This is why you don't dig underneath you.

9307
05:34:31,730 --> 05:34:33,610
Did you see the ghast?

9308
05:34:34,010 --> 05:34:34,530
No.

9309
05:34:35,710 --> 05:34:37,010
Have your shield ready.

9310
05:34:37,790 --> 05:34:38,310
No.

9311
05:34:40,350 --> 05:34:42,150
I don't see him.

9312
05:34:42,150 --> 05:34:45,390
Have your shield ready for bone zones as well.

9313
05:34:45,550 --> 05:34:46,290
For bony fellas.

9314
05:34:47,310 --> 05:34:49,310
I learn sometimes, chat.

9315
05:34:50,690 --> 05:34:51,970
Bony fellas are on the...

9316
05:34:51,970 --> 05:34:53,790
I think he's actually above us.

9317
05:34:53,910 --> 05:34:55,170
Because I don't see him anywhere.

9318
05:34:55,790 --> 05:34:56,410
Hold on.

9319
05:34:56,590 --> 05:34:58,590
I want to put another...

9320
05:34:58,590 --> 05:34:59,350
Torch.

9321
05:35:00,170 --> 05:35:00,650
Oh!

9322
05:35:01,270 --> 05:35:02,070
Oh my god, double.

9323
05:35:02,130 --> 05:35:02,630
That's double?

9324
05:35:03,090 --> 05:35:04,130
That's so messed up.

9325
05:35:05,770 --> 05:35:07,030
Wait, I don't see him.

9326
05:35:07,130 --> 05:35:07,670
He's above us.

9327
05:35:07,690 --> 05:35:08,210
He's above us.

9328
05:35:08,210 --> 05:35:09,070
I knew it.

9329
05:35:09,130 --> 05:35:09,890
I fucking knew it.

9330
05:35:09,890 --> 05:35:10,150
Oh!

9331
05:35:10,410 --> 05:35:11,750
Are these the...

9332
05:35:11,750 --> 05:35:12,990
Where are these?

9333
05:35:14,050 --> 05:35:15,150
I don't know where you are.

9334
05:35:15,910 --> 05:35:17,530
Oh, they're the crimson roots.

9335
05:35:19,590 --> 05:35:20,370
Where are they?

9336
05:35:20,450 --> 05:35:22,370
There's so many white stuff above us.

9337
05:35:23,210 --> 05:35:25,170
I can't tell what is actually...

9338
05:35:25,590 --> 05:35:27,090
How do you not see them?

9339
05:35:27,290 --> 05:35:28,350
I don't see them.

9340
05:35:28,830 --> 05:35:29,750
I don't know where you are.

9341
05:35:29,870 --> 05:35:30,390
Where did you go?

9342
05:35:30,570 --> 05:35:31,170
I went straight.

9343
05:35:31,610 --> 05:35:32,110
I see you.

9344
05:35:32,230 --> 05:35:32,790
Look, I'm here.

9345
05:35:32,790 --> 05:35:33,010
I'm here.

9346
05:35:33,310 --> 05:35:36,430
We can't

9347
05:35:40,200 --> 05:35:41,100
run in this area.

9348
05:35:42,320 --> 05:35:43,100
That's right.

9349
05:35:43,240 --> 05:35:43,700
I'm better.

9350
05:35:44,640 --> 05:35:46,460
I know the drop-off.

9351
05:35:46,780 --> 05:35:48,880
I know the drop-off now.

9352
05:35:49,660 --> 05:35:51,280
That's fucking right, guys.

9353
05:35:53,140 --> 05:35:54,900
I know the drop-off.

9354
05:35:55,160 --> 05:35:56,660
It only took me...

9355
05:35:56,660 --> 05:35:58,040
A little bit.

9356
05:35:59,320 --> 05:36:01,020
Took me a little bit to learn.

9357
05:36:01,280 --> 05:36:02,260
The sand sucks.

9358
05:36:02,680 --> 05:36:03,200
Yeah, it does.

9359
05:36:03,240 --> 05:36:04,280
I'm gonna get the gold here though.

9360
05:36:04,280 --> 05:36:05,420
Okay.

9361
05:36:07,960 --> 05:36:09,280
Get over here.

9362
05:36:10,140 --> 05:36:11,680
Get over here.

9363
05:36:13,100 --> 05:36:15,860
Run, run, run, run!

9364
05:36:16,140 --> 05:36:16,800
Oh my god.

9365
05:36:19,570 --> 05:36:21,070
That didn't help much.

9366
05:36:21,630 --> 05:36:23,150
That's a lot of lava.

9367
05:36:24,090 --> 05:36:25,290
Just keep going.

9368
05:36:26,090 --> 05:36:29,150
You literally find one single thing.

9369
05:36:30,570 --> 05:36:32,550
That was such pain.

9370
05:36:32,550 --> 05:36:34,090
You were right!

9371
05:36:35,150 --> 05:36:35,250
Yay!

9372
05:36:36,670 --> 05:36:37,950
Gold time!

9373
05:36:40,290 --> 05:36:42,730
I put one block in attempt to help.

9374
05:36:43,990 --> 05:36:46,390
I can see that one block helping.

9375
05:36:47,050 --> 05:36:48,970
I was gonna do more, but...

9376
05:36:48,970 --> 05:36:50,070
It started coming out.

9377
05:36:50,150 --> 05:36:52,070
It started flowing faster than I expected.

9378
05:36:52,790 --> 05:36:53,530
What am I doing?

9379
05:36:53,650 --> 05:36:55,110
I just wanted the gold!

9380
05:36:55,350 --> 05:36:56,590
What am I doing?

9381
05:36:57,090 --> 05:36:57,530
Be careful.

9382
05:36:58,970 --> 05:37:00,070
Let's go back up.

9383
05:37:00,530 --> 05:37:02,030
Oh, there's one more gold here.

9384
05:37:02,390 --> 05:37:03,350
Nice, alright.

9385
05:37:08,390 --> 05:37:09,970
We can go from here.

9386
05:37:10,630 --> 05:37:12,410
We don't need the bones for anything, right?

9387
05:37:14,290 --> 05:37:15,450
I don't think so.

9388
05:37:15,830 --> 05:37:17,010
I wanna see if I can get a dog.

9389
05:37:18,650 --> 05:37:19,370
I'll grab one.

9390
05:37:20,630 --> 05:37:21,470
Oh wait, I already have...

9391
05:37:21,470 --> 05:37:22,390
I'll grab one.

9392
05:37:23,670 --> 05:37:25,130
Oh no, that's for bone meal.

9393
05:37:25,190 --> 05:37:26,370
I don't fucking need that.

9394
05:37:26,370 --> 05:37:28,410
Oh yeah, you can't turn the...

9395
05:37:28,410 --> 05:37:30,350
big bones into bone bone.

9396
05:37:31,330 --> 05:37:33,630
But what about bone town?

9397
05:37:34,250 --> 05:37:36,530
How am I gonna get to bone town?

9398
05:37:39,350 --> 05:37:40,690
Wait, how do we get down?

9399
05:37:43,590 --> 05:37:45,130
I don't know.

9400
05:37:46,670 --> 05:37:47,950
Wait, there's a fortress?

9401
05:37:48,810 --> 05:37:49,250
Where?

9402
05:37:50,750 --> 05:37:51,730
Is that it?

9403
05:37:52,290 --> 05:37:52,970
Is that a fortress?

9404
05:37:52,970 --> 05:37:53,030
Is that a fortress?

9405
05:37:54,890 --> 05:37:56,070
Oh, you could use the bow.

9406
05:37:56,230 --> 05:37:57,150
Wait, we have the bow.

9407
05:37:57,290 --> 05:37:57,990
Oh, you're right.

9408
05:37:58,990 --> 05:38:00,130
Use the bow, use the bow.

9409
05:38:02,850 --> 05:38:04,450
It won't sing, I'm blind.

9410
05:38:05,370 --> 05:38:06,810
What if below us is fire?

9411
05:38:07,210 --> 05:38:07,730
Can you check?

9412
05:38:08,410 --> 05:38:09,050
Wait, is...

9413
05:38:10,190 --> 05:38:11,230
We're good, we're good, we're good.

9414
05:38:15,990 --> 05:38:19,830
Oh, we got one guy.

9415
05:38:20,170 --> 05:38:20,490
Nevermind.

9416
05:38:20,490 --> 05:38:22,390
Oh, come on.

9417
05:38:22,650 --> 05:38:23,130
Nevermind.

9418
05:38:23,250 --> 05:38:24,490
I just saw somebody be like...

9419
05:38:25,210 --> 05:38:26,290
Can't believe she's blind.

9420
05:38:26,410 --> 05:38:28,530
And another guy was like, there's a fortress.

9421
05:38:28,730 --> 05:38:29,710
So I was like, oh what?

9422
05:38:31,070 --> 05:38:32,350
Did we get one guy?

9423
05:38:32,550 --> 05:38:34,230
Oh, I see this magma cube that's just...

9424
05:38:34,230 --> 05:38:35,530
Yeah, but it's so far.

9425
05:38:36,270 --> 05:38:36,690
Yeah.

9426
05:38:37,730 --> 05:38:39,070
I'm just gonna head straight.

9427
05:38:40,410 --> 05:38:41,670
Just gotta get lucky.

9428
05:38:42,670 --> 05:38:44,910
Wouldn't be fucked up if like...

9429
05:38:44,910 --> 05:38:45,410
Uh...

9430
05:38:45,410 --> 05:38:47,990
The fortress was like literally the other direction.

9431
05:38:49,150 --> 05:38:50,650
Yeah, that'd be kind of messed up.

9432
05:38:50,730 --> 05:38:52,050
That'd be so messed up.

9433
05:38:52,590 --> 05:38:53,610
Yeah, that would kind of suck.

9434
05:38:53,750 --> 05:38:55,310
Yeah, that would really suck, guys.

9435
05:38:55,830 --> 05:38:57,010
Oh, there's a ghastly.

9436
05:38:58,230 --> 05:38:59,430
No, why are they...

9437
05:38:59,430 --> 05:39:00,650
Why do they spawn everywhere?

9438
05:39:00,930 --> 05:39:04,450
I feel like the new update made them spawn...

9439
05:39:04,450 --> 05:39:05,230
Wait, what?

9440
05:39:05,350 --> 05:39:06,070
That should've hit.

9441
05:39:08,370 --> 05:39:09,170
Sometimes it's...

9442
05:39:09,170 --> 05:39:09,870
Oh, there you go.

9443
05:39:09,970 --> 05:39:10,650
Oh, yeah, it's hidden.

9444
05:39:12,350 --> 05:39:13,030
Oh, shoot.

9445
05:39:13,290 --> 05:39:13,510
Why?

9446
05:39:13,850 --> 05:39:14,030
Oh.

9447
05:39:14,930 --> 05:39:16,050
Oh, my gosh.

9448
05:39:16,110 --> 05:39:16,950
You got him?

9449
05:39:17,210 --> 05:39:17,470
No.

9450
05:39:17,730 --> 05:39:18,650
Oh, now I have, yeah.

9451
05:39:18,970 --> 05:39:20,770
Oh, I almost went forward.

9452
05:39:20,910 --> 05:39:22,550
Oh, my God, I almost fell in there, too.

9453
05:39:24,090 --> 05:39:24,570
Holy...

9454
05:39:24,570 --> 05:39:26,370
Oh, my God.

9455
05:39:26,790 --> 05:39:28,150
Oh, I almost went back.

9456
05:39:28,350 --> 05:39:29,690
Don't do it.

9457
05:39:29,910 --> 05:39:31,870
I almost jumped back in.

9458
05:39:31,990 --> 05:39:33,450
There's a skelly in there, too.

9459
05:39:33,470 --> 05:39:35,870
I felt extra wild today.

9460
05:39:37,750 --> 05:39:38,610
Only today.

9461
05:39:38,810 --> 05:39:39,970
Only today.

9462
05:39:39,970 --> 05:39:40,230
Only today.

9463
05:39:46,810 --> 05:39:50,870
I could've closed that hole up, but I decided not to.

9464
05:39:52,710 --> 05:39:54,550
I feel extra crazy.

9465
05:39:54,730 --> 05:39:55,490
Oh, my God.

9466
05:39:55,830 --> 05:39:57,330
She's crazy.

9467
05:39:57,690 --> 05:39:58,590
She's wild.

9468
05:39:59,030 --> 05:40:02,010
She's gonna do something wild, guys.

9469
05:40:05,870 --> 05:40:08,230
I think this is the worst part.

9470
05:40:09,150 --> 05:40:11,070
Trying to find...

9471
05:40:12,590 --> 05:40:13,010
Yeah.

9472
05:40:13,990 --> 05:40:16,090
How do people... How do speedrunners do it?

9473
05:40:17,070 --> 05:40:18,490
They just get lucky, I think.

9474
05:40:18,850 --> 05:40:19,370
Are you firing?

9475
05:40:19,510 --> 05:40:20,810
Oh, I see what you're going for.

9476
05:40:22,430 --> 05:40:25,390
Yeah, because I don't want him to fucking shoot his arrow and I go...

9477
05:40:26,830 --> 05:40:27,710
Set seed?

9478
05:40:28,310 --> 05:40:29,430
No, that's boring.

9479
05:40:29,870 --> 05:40:30,310
Yeah.

9480
05:40:31,430 --> 05:40:32,990
I know some of them don't do set seed.

9481
05:40:33,090 --> 05:40:37,470
I think they, like, reset over and over again until, like...

9482
05:40:37,470 --> 05:40:39,350
Oh, they know what they're getting.

9483
05:40:40,050 --> 05:40:41,350
Or, like, they get a good thing.

9484
05:40:41,350 --> 05:40:41,830
Yeah.

9485
05:40:42,570 --> 05:40:42,970
Oops.

9486
05:40:44,070 --> 05:40:44,630
I'm good.

9487
05:40:45,450 --> 05:40:46,870
I mean, that's what speedrunners do.

9488
05:40:46,930 --> 05:40:49,290
They do it, like, a million different times until it works.

9489
05:40:50,010 --> 05:40:51,010
Do you have more arrows?

9490
05:40:52,230 --> 05:40:53,710
Yeah, I have spectral arrows.

9491
05:40:53,830 --> 05:40:54,190
Do you want them?

9492
05:40:54,310 --> 05:40:55,730
Yeah, I'll take some.

9493
05:40:56,270 --> 05:40:57,290
Oh, there's another ghast over there.

9494
05:40:57,290 --> 05:40:58,230
Yeah, that's why, yeah.

9495
05:41:05,130 --> 05:41:06,170
Alright, nice.

9496
05:41:06,190 --> 05:41:07,490
I'm gonna eat some food.

9497
05:41:08,590 --> 05:41:09,330
Oh, IRL?

9498
05:41:09,930 --> 05:41:10,330
Yeah.

9499
05:41:10,330 --> 05:41:10,390
Yeah.

9500
05:41:13,610 --> 05:41:16,670
Holy shit, there's so many soul sand.

9501
05:41:17,290 --> 05:41:18,830
Oh my god, how are we gonna get it?

9502
05:41:18,890 --> 05:41:20,490
Oh, this is so scary to get across.

9503
05:41:21,030 --> 05:41:22,090
It's literally lava.

9504
05:41:22,510 --> 05:41:24,050
Straight up lava on the other side.

9505
05:41:24,630 --> 05:41:24,970
Oh.

9506
05:41:25,290 --> 05:41:26,670
I don't know if we should cross that.

9507
05:41:28,090 --> 05:41:29,850
I don't know, it's a little dangerous.

9508
05:41:31,950 --> 05:41:33,910
With ghast spawning, I wouldn't.

9509
05:41:35,030 --> 05:41:36,490
Yeah, so where should we go then?

9510
05:41:37,370 --> 05:41:38,290
I don't know.

9511
05:41:38,390 --> 05:41:39,730
Oh, I think we...through the walls.

9512
05:41:40,610 --> 05:41:41,900
I feel like maybe that direction?

9513
05:41:42,370 --> 05:41:43,030
The right side?

9514
05:41:44,530 --> 05:41:45,750
That's the way we came from.

9515
05:41:45,850 --> 05:41:46,270
Isn't that?

9516
05:41:46,390 --> 05:41:47,730
I thought we came from the back.

9517
05:41:50,070 --> 05:41:51,790
I don't remember where we came from.

9518
05:41:52,250 --> 05:41:53,910
Like, I think if we just dig this way.

9519
05:41:54,290 --> 05:41:54,590
Alright.

9520
05:41:57,710 --> 05:41:59,210
We can just dig on through.

9521
05:42:00,450 --> 05:42:02,850
I was like, it would be silly if we make a bridge across.

9522
05:42:02,970 --> 05:42:03,950
Yeah, it would be pretty silly.

9523
05:42:04,710 --> 05:42:07,630
It would be so silly if we did that.

9524
05:42:07,630 --> 05:42:09,450
Yeah, let's just dig.

9525
05:42:10,650 --> 05:42:12,110
Stand far away.

9526
05:42:14,050 --> 05:42:14,730
As you do.

9527
05:42:20,090 --> 05:42:22,230
Are we never making it back?

9528
05:42:22,370 --> 05:42:24,370
Oh yeah, that's probably a problem, right?

9529
05:42:24,390 --> 05:42:25,430
No, we'll get back.

9530
05:42:25,750 --> 05:42:26,470
We have the coordinates.

9531
05:42:26,930 --> 05:42:27,930
Oh yeah, we have the coordinates.

9532
05:42:29,590 --> 05:42:30,570
We're fine.

9533
05:42:31,070 --> 05:42:32,410
Yeah, we're fine.

9534
05:42:34,210 --> 05:42:34,730
Alright.

9535
05:42:34,730 --> 05:42:35,010
Alright.

9536
05:42:36,130 --> 05:42:37,250
Oh, you want me to dig?

9537
05:42:37,350 --> 05:42:39,010
You want me to do it?

9538
05:42:39,210 --> 05:42:40,030
Yeah, you can do it.

9539
05:42:41,150 --> 05:42:41,550
Switch.

9540
05:42:48,470 --> 05:42:50,590
Wait, hold on.

9541
05:42:50,630 --> 05:42:52,030
Let me set up my setup.

9542
05:42:52,490 --> 05:42:53,630
For optimal.

9543
05:42:53,970 --> 05:42:56,290
We don't have obsidian.

9544
05:42:57,210 --> 05:42:58,090
We don't have obsidian.

9545
05:42:58,350 --> 05:42:59,350
Oh my god, this gas.

9546
05:42:59,770 --> 05:43:01,010
There's so many.

9547
05:43:01,010 --> 05:43:01,970
I know.

9548
05:43:02,630 --> 05:43:04,450
Oh shit, watch out.

9549
05:43:08,970 --> 05:43:10,990
Nevermind, I didn't even need to warn you.

9550
05:43:14,150 --> 05:43:16,410
What do we do?

9551
05:43:17,450 --> 05:43:17,970
What do you mean?

9552
05:43:18,410 --> 05:43:19,250
Oh, okay.

9553
05:43:22,090 --> 05:43:23,730
I continue onward.

9554
05:43:24,210 --> 05:43:24,950
So brave.

9555
05:43:25,070 --> 05:43:26,270
She's so brave, guys.

9556
05:43:26,630 --> 05:43:27,050
I know.

9557
05:43:27,830 --> 05:43:29,330
I'm so brave.

9558
05:43:29,370 --> 05:43:29,970
Oh my god.

9559
05:43:30,310 --> 05:43:31,970
She knows what she's doing.

9560
05:43:32,150 --> 05:43:33,170
I'm tabbing out.

9561
05:43:34,650 --> 05:43:36,230
You're tabbing out?

9562
05:43:37,190 --> 05:43:40,290
I realized there hasn't been music for an hour.

9563
05:43:43,190 --> 05:43:47,510
I just realized music stopped for an hour.

9564
05:43:53,030 --> 05:43:55,010
Alright, I'm back.

9565
05:43:56,310 --> 05:43:57,090
Welcome back.

9566
05:43:57,710 --> 05:43:58,810
Where are my torches?

9567
05:43:58,950 --> 05:43:59,730
Oh, there it is.

9568
05:43:59,830 --> 05:44:01,110
My chat's probably going insane though.

9569
05:44:01,210 --> 05:44:02,670
It's been the same song for five hours.

9570
05:44:02,850 --> 05:44:04,950
You've been using the same song for...

9571
05:44:07,150 --> 05:44:08,810
Yeah, sorry guys.

9572
05:44:09,310 --> 05:44:10,030
Do you want a different song?

9573
05:44:11,430 --> 05:44:12,510
Sorry, too late.

9574
05:44:12,770 --> 05:44:14,090
They've already...

9575
05:44:15,730 --> 05:44:18,490
They've already Stockholm Syndrome'd themselves with this song.

9576
05:44:19,310 --> 05:44:19,830
Probably.

9577
05:44:21,070 --> 05:44:22,730
Oh, this is very dangerous.

9578
05:44:24,510 --> 05:44:25,650
Oh, skele-man?

9579
05:44:26,350 --> 05:44:26,830
Engassed.

9580
05:44:27,650 --> 05:44:28,130
Where?

9581
05:44:28,750 --> 05:44:30,110
Oh, that's a bastion.

9582
05:44:30,970 --> 05:44:32,110
That's not a skele-man.

9583
05:44:33,090 --> 05:44:34,010
Wait, that means we're close.

9584
05:44:34,110 --> 05:44:35,350
That's the fortress enemy.

9585
05:44:37,130 --> 05:44:39,050
Does it mean we're close to what?

9586
05:44:39,110 --> 05:44:40,230
Isn't that a fortress enemy?

9587
05:44:43,650 --> 05:44:45,850
I don't think we're going into the bastion.

9588
05:44:46,190 --> 05:44:47,670
I don't think it would be wise.

9589
05:44:48,130 --> 05:44:50,090
They will actually kick our asses.

9590
05:44:50,770 --> 05:44:51,170
What?

9591
05:44:54,430 --> 05:44:56,370
They will actually kick our asses.

9592
05:44:56,410 --> 05:44:58,030
They don't care that we're wearing gold.

9593
05:44:58,030 --> 05:45:00,330
Wait, aren't they the black skellies?

9594
05:45:01,470 --> 05:45:02,350
No, no, no.

9595
05:45:02,390 --> 05:45:03,370
Wait, what's a bastion?

9596
05:45:03,930 --> 05:45:05,730
That's like the stronger piggies.

9597
05:45:06,810 --> 05:45:07,210
Oh!

9598
05:45:09,250 --> 05:45:11,950
Oh, I thought you were talking about the black skellies.

9599
05:45:12,690 --> 05:45:13,750
No, please, not me.

9600
05:45:14,110 --> 05:45:14,830
Please, not me.

9601
05:45:15,010 --> 05:45:15,590
Oh, fuck.

9602
05:45:16,050 --> 05:45:17,470
Uh-oh, Doki, I'm in trouble.

9603
05:45:17,470 --> 05:45:19,170
Oh, wait.

9604
05:45:19,230 --> 05:45:20,030
That's not my thing.

9605
05:45:20,250 --> 05:45:23,810
I'm trying to figure out the drop-off.

9606
05:45:23,910 --> 05:45:25,870
I got it, I got it.

9607
05:45:25,990 --> 05:45:27,250
I gave all my arrows to you.

9608
05:45:27,350 --> 05:45:28,490
I was like, why isn't it shooting?

9609
05:45:31,990 --> 05:45:33,190
I'll give you some of the arrows.

9610
05:45:33,250 --> 05:45:34,770
Okay, let's split on this one.

9611
05:45:35,890 --> 05:45:36,750
Oh, my God.

9612
05:45:36,990 --> 05:45:39,490
I didn't realize you didn't have any arrows left.

9613
05:45:39,890 --> 05:45:42,850
I thought you were talking about the black skellies.

9614
05:45:43,510 --> 05:45:44,390
I thought that's what they're called.

9615
05:45:44,390 --> 05:45:47,710
I thought... No, I wish that that was them.

9616
05:45:49,650 --> 05:45:50,490
Where'd you go?

9617
05:45:50,730 --> 05:45:51,250
Right here.

9618
05:45:52,230 --> 05:45:53,590
Grab my sword.

9619
05:45:54,610 --> 05:45:55,310
Oh, shit.

9620
05:45:59,250 --> 05:46:00,510
That's right, shoot that arrow.

9621
05:46:00,950 --> 05:46:02,950
That's fucking right, you stupid idiot.

9622
05:46:03,330 --> 05:46:04,070
Where are you at?

9623
05:46:04,190 --> 05:46:04,730
Right here.

9624
05:46:05,970 --> 05:46:07,050
Look up, look up, look up.

9625
05:46:08,370 --> 05:46:08,910
Look up.

9626
05:46:09,190 --> 05:46:10,030
Oh, shit.

9627
05:46:11,950 --> 05:46:12,470
Oh, my God.

9628
05:46:12,930 --> 05:46:13,970
I got you.

9629
05:46:16,530 --> 05:46:17,490
There, I got you.

9630
05:46:18,390 --> 05:46:19,010
You hit any?

9631
05:46:19,490 --> 05:46:20,630
Is that the arrows you shot?

9632
05:46:20,750 --> 05:46:22,670
Are those the gold arrows you shot right there?

9633
05:46:23,090 --> 05:46:24,190
Is that...

9634
05:46:24,190 --> 05:46:25,730
Yeah, I'm gonna kick him.

9635
05:46:27,230 --> 05:46:28,250
Oh, there you are.

9636
05:46:28,910 --> 05:46:29,750
You know what?

9637
05:46:29,770 --> 05:46:30,450
You were closer.

9638
05:46:31,810 --> 05:46:33,010
Oh, it left a tear.

9639
05:46:33,550 --> 05:46:34,350
Oh, that's good.

9640
05:46:34,550 --> 05:46:35,670
What are the tears for again?

9641
05:46:35,910 --> 05:46:36,570
Potions, right?

9642
05:46:37,810 --> 05:46:38,890
Maybe, I don't remember.

9643
05:46:38,890 --> 05:46:39,430
I don't remember.

9644
05:46:39,490 --> 05:46:40,670
I know the tears were good for something.

9645
05:46:40,670 --> 05:46:41,930
Some sort of potion thing, yeah.

9646
05:46:49,130 --> 05:46:50,450
There's a scary sound.

9647
05:46:52,890 --> 05:46:54,210
Where did we go?

9648
05:46:54,570 --> 05:46:55,670
Oh, regen potion.

9649
05:46:57,870 --> 05:46:58,610
That's good.

9650
05:46:58,810 --> 05:46:59,770
That's a good thing to have.

9651
05:47:00,190 --> 05:47:01,510
Do we need soul soil?

9652
05:47:01,910 --> 05:47:02,590
Do we need that?

9653
05:47:03,070 --> 05:47:04,670
No, I don't think so.

9654
05:47:05,150 --> 05:47:07,110
So many things I don't know we need.

9655
05:47:08,010 --> 05:47:09,490
Where do we go, guys?

9656
05:47:09,510 --> 05:47:10,250
Where do we go?

9657
05:47:10,250 --> 05:47:11,710
Oh, unlucky.

9658
05:47:14,060 --> 05:47:16,030
We're in the fortress.

9659
05:47:16,830 --> 05:47:20,190
I don't even know where we are.

9660
05:47:21,210 --> 05:47:22,110
I'm gonna kill the skeleton.

9661
05:47:22,410 --> 05:47:23,450
This guy looked at me funny.

9662
05:47:25,810 --> 05:47:28,690
There we go.

9663
05:47:30,000 --> 05:47:30,410
Yeah.

9664
05:47:32,710 --> 05:47:34,650
Let's block on over.

9665
05:47:39,050 --> 05:47:40,770
Oh, there it goes.

9666
05:47:41,810 --> 05:47:43,750
Why did it fall?

9667
05:47:45,830 --> 05:47:46,390
Oh my god.

9668
05:47:46,410 --> 05:47:47,070
Oh my god.

9669
05:47:49,370 --> 05:47:52,810
Why is there so many of you?

9670
05:47:53,270 --> 05:47:54,250
I think they...

9671
05:47:54,250 --> 05:47:54,690
Oh my god.

9672
05:47:55,550 --> 05:47:59,490
Wait, what is...

9673
05:47:59,490 --> 05:48:01,670
I shot the pigs!

9674
05:48:01,930 --> 05:48:03,550
I shot the pigs!

9675
05:48:03,550 --> 05:48:06,350
Oh god, Doki, they're all coming for you!

9676
05:48:06,450 --> 05:48:09,150
I don't know how I shot them.

9677
05:48:09,590 --> 05:48:11,430
There's another ghast.

9678
05:48:11,470 --> 05:48:12,330
Watch out.

9679
05:48:12,910 --> 05:48:14,150
This can't be it.

9680
05:48:14,450 --> 05:48:15,510
There's two of them!

9681
05:48:16,990 --> 05:48:17,790
Oh my god.

9682
05:48:18,130 --> 05:48:20,110
This is so bad.

9683
05:48:20,570 --> 05:48:21,170
Just run.

9684
05:48:21,290 --> 05:48:22,590
I'll try to take care of the ghasts.

9685
05:48:23,210 --> 05:48:23,850
I got one.

9686
05:48:28,190 --> 05:48:28,930
Where are you?

9687
05:48:30,090 --> 05:48:32,610
I killed the other ghast.

9688
05:48:32,610 --> 05:48:33,450
Oh, you got him?

9689
05:48:33,770 --> 05:48:34,150
You're running?

9690
05:48:34,330 --> 05:48:35,490
Oh my god!

9691
05:48:43,230 --> 05:48:43,790
I'm okay.

9692
05:48:44,490 --> 05:48:46,370
No, I'm not.

9693
05:48:46,950 --> 05:48:48,210
I'm not okay.

9694
05:48:48,870 --> 05:48:51,150
I think all we have to do is kill these guys...

9695
05:48:51,150 --> 05:48:53,630
away from other pigs and we'll be fine.

9696
05:48:55,790 --> 05:48:56,870
I don't...

9697
05:48:56,870 --> 05:48:58,950
I don't...

9698
05:48:58,950 --> 05:48:59,570
Oh my god.

9699
05:49:07,210 --> 05:49:08,530
I don't know how...

9700
05:49:08,530 --> 05:49:10,570
I don't know how I aggroed him.

9701
05:49:10,870 --> 05:49:11,210
No!

9702
05:49:12,470 --> 05:49:13,530
There's another ghast.

9703
05:49:13,950 --> 05:49:15,670
There's a ghast in front of me!

9704
05:49:21,090 --> 05:49:23,410
I don't know if I can take them all.

9705
05:49:23,870 --> 05:49:24,530
Can I get them?

9706
05:49:25,390 --> 05:49:26,550
I'm gonna start shooting them.

9707
05:49:29,610 --> 05:49:30,010
Oh.

9708
05:49:31,790 --> 05:49:33,550
I'm gonna use up all my spectral arrow.

9709
05:49:33,670 --> 05:49:34,670
I'm just letting you know that.

9710
05:49:35,350 --> 05:49:36,430
Wait, wait, wait!

9711
05:49:36,490 --> 05:49:37,250
Don't do that!

9712
05:49:37,430 --> 05:49:38,850
I have 15 left!

9713
05:49:40,910 --> 05:49:42,350
Here I'll start attacking too.

9714
05:49:44,130 --> 05:49:44,530
Oh,

9715
05:49:47,690 --> 05:49:49,230
I hope...

9716
05:49:49,230 --> 05:49:49,830
Oh my god.

9717
05:49:52,770 --> 05:49:53,570
Use your shield!

9718
05:49:53,710 --> 05:49:54,130
Use your shield!

9719
05:49:54,350 --> 05:49:55,370
I am!

9720
05:49:55,370 --> 05:49:56,250
Oh my god.

9721
05:49:56,250 --> 05:49:56,850
I'm coming!

9722
05:49:57,050 --> 05:49:57,250
I'm coming!

9723
05:50:02,190 --> 05:50:03,210
Oh my god.

9724
05:50:03,270 --> 05:50:04,210
There's a ghast still.

9725
05:50:05,110 --> 05:50:06,590
There's a ghast still.

9726
05:50:08,510 --> 05:50:09,050
Oh my god.

9727
05:50:11,050 --> 05:50:15,130
Oh my gosh.

9728
05:50:15,490 --> 05:50:16,430
Eat, eat, eat.

9729
05:50:16,910 --> 05:50:18,610
Oh, there's two ghasts.

9730
05:50:19,970 --> 05:50:21,070
Oh my god, please.

9731
05:50:21,250 --> 05:50:22,330
Why are there so many ghasts?

9732
05:50:22,430 --> 05:50:23,170
What did they do?

9733
05:50:23,170 --> 05:50:25,550
Why did they up the nether so much?

9734
05:50:25,630 --> 05:50:27,430
This is so messed up.

9735
05:50:28,310 --> 05:50:29,430
Oh my god.

9736
05:50:29,510 --> 05:50:30,090
Watch out, Doki.

9737
05:50:30,190 --> 05:50:31,490
It's like literally right behind you.

9738
05:50:31,970 --> 05:50:32,470
Oh my god.

9739
05:50:32,710 --> 05:50:33,490
There's another one?

9740
05:50:33,850 --> 05:50:35,170
He's still spawning!

9741
05:50:36,610 --> 05:50:37,950
We need more arrows.

9742
05:50:38,090 --> 05:50:39,210
We don't have enough arrows.

9743
05:50:41,950 --> 05:50:42,290
Yeah.

9744
05:50:46,270 --> 05:50:48,390
I'm trying to figure out the drop-off for this guy.

9745
05:50:48,910 --> 05:50:49,410
Oh my god.

9746
05:50:49,450 --> 05:50:49,930
I can't item.

9747
05:50:49,930 --> 05:50:50,870
I can't.

9748
05:50:50,970 --> 05:50:51,990
Oh, I got him once.

9749
05:50:54,290 --> 05:50:55,470
Oh my god.

9750
05:50:55,510 --> 05:50:57,370
Is he closer than I expected?

9751
05:50:58,150 --> 05:50:59,390
Where is it?

9752
05:50:59,470 --> 05:51:05,770
Oh my god.

9753
05:51:05,830 --> 05:51:06,670
Let's just get out of here.

9754
05:51:09,090 --> 05:51:11,650
I hate this area, man.

9755
05:51:11,790 --> 05:51:13,530
I hate this area.

9756
05:51:14,290 --> 05:51:15,290
This area sucks.

9757
05:51:15,950 --> 05:51:17,150
Oh my god.

9758
05:51:17,270 --> 05:51:17,830
Get his ass.

9759
05:51:17,830 --> 05:51:22,410
This area apparently has more spawns for Ghastlies.

9760
05:51:22,690 --> 05:51:22,850
What?

9761
05:51:23,490 --> 05:51:23,930
Why?

9762
05:51:24,070 --> 05:51:24,490
I thought it was...

9763
05:51:24,490 --> 05:51:27,010
That's what they've been trying to tell us this entire time.

9764
05:51:27,110 --> 05:51:28,490
They're like, get out of there.

9765
05:51:28,750 --> 05:51:30,330
Ghastlies love this place.

9766
05:51:30,630 --> 05:51:32,570
But I thought they loved the red area.

9767
05:51:32,790 --> 05:51:34,970
Okay, we can't go that way because that's to the bastion.

9768
05:51:35,050 --> 05:51:36,930
And they will, like, mog us.

9769
05:51:37,370 --> 05:51:38,230
It'll be so bad.

9770
05:51:38,670 --> 05:51:39,070
Oh, here.

9771
05:51:39,730 --> 05:51:40,150
Oh my god.

9772
05:51:40,290 --> 05:51:41,190
Oh my god.

9773
05:51:41,270 --> 05:51:42,150
Another one!

9774
05:51:43,250 --> 05:51:44,410
We need to get out.

9775
05:51:44,410 --> 05:51:46,010
We need to get out.

9776
05:51:46,270 --> 05:51:47,850
It's so sad.

9777
05:51:48,030 --> 05:51:48,930
How do we get out of this?

9778
05:51:49,170 --> 05:51:52,430
I don't know how we got here in the first place.

9779
05:51:56,710 --> 05:51:58,170
Red area has the pigs.

9780
05:51:59,970 --> 05:52:00,850
I killed him.

9781
05:52:01,470 --> 05:52:01,870
Okay.

9782
05:52:05,110 --> 05:52:05,510
Alright.

9783
05:52:07,190 --> 05:52:08,310
We just gotta get out.

9784
05:52:09,030 --> 05:52:09,730
Just gotta get out.

9785
05:52:09,850 --> 05:52:10,190
Oh my god.

9786
05:52:10,210 --> 05:52:10,930
Another one spawned in.

9787
05:52:10,930 --> 05:52:12,750
I don't know how... Do you have the coordinates?

9788
05:52:13,790 --> 05:52:14,510
How do we get here?

9789
05:52:16,610 --> 05:52:17,510
Okay, hold on.

9790
05:52:17,970 --> 05:52:20,050
How do we get out of here?

9791
05:52:20,830 --> 05:52:22,230
Just run this way.

9792
05:52:23,330 --> 05:52:23,830
I don't know.

9793
05:52:23,950 --> 05:52:25,110
I think a bridge would be...

9794
05:52:25,510 --> 05:52:26,690
Maybe the easiest way.

9795
05:52:26,910 --> 05:52:28,270
A bridge in this area?

9796
05:52:28,610 --> 05:52:29,850
That's what I don't know!

9797
05:52:32,050 --> 05:52:32,750
We're in the red.

9798
05:52:38,130 --> 05:52:39,690
Let's just explore the red area.

9799
05:52:39,690 --> 05:52:40,590
Let's just explore.

9800
05:52:40,870 --> 05:52:43,210
Let's never go back.

9801
05:52:43,410 --> 05:52:44,210
Let's never go back.

9802
05:52:44,210 --> 05:52:47,290
Never go back.

9803
05:52:47,450 --> 05:52:48,170
We learned our lesson.

9804
05:52:48,570 --> 05:52:50,670
I don't wanna go back.

9805
05:52:51,510 --> 05:52:52,570
Red area is better.

9806
05:52:52,890 --> 05:52:54,450
Oh my god.

9807
05:52:55,030 --> 05:52:56,330
Oh my god.

9808
05:52:56,530 --> 05:52:58,550
Just leave.

9809
05:52:58,970 --> 05:53:00,130
Oh my gosh.

9810
05:53:01,490 --> 05:53:02,130
I can trade.

9811
05:53:03,950 --> 05:53:04,710
Trade.

9812
05:53:05,610 --> 05:53:06,110
Trade.

9813
05:53:10,510 --> 05:53:12,010
Just give me stuff.

9814
05:53:13,090 --> 05:53:14,190
Oh thank god.

9815
05:53:14,490 --> 05:53:15,210
Spectral arrows.

9816
05:53:15,470 --> 05:53:16,390
Oh thank god.

9817
05:53:17,690 --> 05:53:18,890
Maybe he'll give you more.

9818
05:53:19,190 --> 05:53:20,410
I have leather right here.

9819
05:53:20,450 --> 05:53:21,130
You have leather, right?

9820
05:53:21,630 --> 05:53:22,170
Oh yeah, yeah.

9821
05:53:22,190 --> 05:53:22,630
I'll take it.

9822
05:53:23,590 --> 05:53:24,690
Did he give you anything else?

9823
05:53:25,090 --> 05:53:26,510
No, they gave me spectral arrows.

9824
05:53:26,750 --> 05:53:28,530
There's more right here.

9825
05:53:28,890 --> 05:53:29,750
That they didn't pick up.

9826
05:53:30,010 --> 05:53:32,110
I like to only give them one at a time.

9827
05:53:32,250 --> 05:53:34,270
Because they end up missing a bunch.

9828
05:53:36,350 --> 05:53:37,350
Oh my god.

9829
05:53:37,350 --> 05:53:39,670
I would make him a hole if he...

9830
05:53:39,670 --> 05:53:42,150
I know, like, he takes it and then runs off.

9831
05:53:42,250 --> 05:53:42,650
I know.

9832
05:53:44,430 --> 05:53:45,670
Like, he's stupid.

9833
05:53:46,650 --> 05:53:47,890
Oh, they gave me more arrows.

9834
05:53:48,350 --> 05:53:48,670
Nice.

9835
05:53:48,830 --> 05:53:49,990
We both need that.

9836
05:53:51,730 --> 05:53:52,750
I'm gassed.

9837
05:53:52,890 --> 05:53:54,850
I'm going to become the Joker.

9838
05:53:55,270 --> 05:53:55,810
Leave us alone.

9839
05:53:56,410 --> 05:53:59,170
It only takes one bad day.

9840
05:54:05,130 --> 05:54:05,570
Yeah.

9841
05:54:05,570 --> 05:54:06,230
Oh, the fire resistance!

9842
05:54:06,390 --> 05:54:06,790
Fire resistance!

9843
05:54:06,990 --> 05:54:09,030
We have two now.

9844
05:54:10,850 --> 05:54:12,090
How much is that?

9845
05:54:12,490 --> 05:54:13,030
Three minutes.

9846
05:54:15,190 --> 05:54:16,390
You got it, right?

9847
05:54:16,530 --> 05:54:17,410
He gave another one!

9848
05:54:19,550 --> 05:54:20,290
Oh my god.

9849
05:54:20,350 --> 05:54:21,390
This is a lucky gacha.

9850
05:54:22,730 --> 05:54:24,390
I can only carry one fire resistance.

9851
05:54:24,610 --> 05:54:25,490
I can't stack up.

9852
05:54:25,490 --> 05:54:27,390
Oh, no, no, they don't stack up.

9853
05:54:27,490 --> 05:54:29,110
Unless that was the one he...

9854
05:54:29,110 --> 05:54:30,170
The one that you...

9855
05:54:30,170 --> 05:54:30,830
No, no, no.

9856
05:54:30,910 --> 05:54:32,390
I got the second one already.

9857
05:54:32,770 --> 05:54:34,810
He gave bricks.

9858
05:54:35,430 --> 05:54:36,230
Where did he go?

9859
05:54:37,650 --> 05:54:38,670
Uh, he's here.

9860
05:54:38,770 --> 05:54:39,630
I think he's all out.

9861
05:54:40,470 --> 05:54:40,990
Oh, nevermind.

9862
05:54:41,430 --> 05:54:42,170
No, I have more.

9863
05:54:43,610 --> 05:54:43,890
Okay.

9864
05:54:46,210 --> 05:54:48,070
What's that sound?

9865
05:54:49,170 --> 05:54:50,170
Do you hear that?

9866
05:54:50,590 --> 05:54:51,330
The gassed?

9867
05:54:51,590 --> 05:54:52,010
No.

9868
05:54:52,850 --> 05:54:54,230
Did you hear the sparkles sound?

9869
05:54:54,230 --> 05:54:55,590
Oh my god!

9870
05:54:55,910 --> 05:54:56,930
Are you fucking...

9871
05:54:56,930 --> 05:54:59,050
Are you fucking serious?

9872
05:54:59,890 --> 05:55:00,990
I hate them.

9873
05:55:01,110 --> 05:55:02,170
I hate these guys.

9874
05:55:02,170 --> 05:55:02,790
I hate them.

9875
05:55:03,190 --> 05:55:05,190
With every fiber of my being.

9876
05:55:05,190 --> 05:55:06,170
I hate them so much.

9877
05:55:07,950 --> 05:55:08,350
Oh my god.

9878
05:55:08,830 --> 05:55:10,050
Let's just leave.

9879
05:55:10,690 --> 05:55:12,250
Okay, okay.

9880
05:55:12,350 --> 05:55:14,430
I don't want to deal with them.

9881
05:55:14,710 --> 05:55:17,090
They can have this area.

9882
05:55:18,370 --> 05:55:19,790
They live here.

9883
05:55:19,870 --> 05:55:20,850
I don't care anymore.

9884
05:55:24,230 --> 05:55:25,850
I don't want to deal with them anymore.

9885
05:55:25,950 --> 05:55:27,050
It's a tactical retreat.

9886
05:55:27,830 --> 05:55:29,130
It's so tactical.

9887
05:55:31,470 --> 05:55:33,730
I don't see a fortress.

9888
05:55:34,170 --> 05:55:36,030
Oh, this is a different biome though.

9889
05:55:36,150 --> 05:55:36,470
Nice.

9890
05:55:37,630 --> 05:55:39,390
This one's not as bad.

9891
05:55:39,570 --> 05:55:42,650
There's just a lot of lava and sometimes magma cubes.

9892
05:55:43,950 --> 05:55:44,250
Yeah.

9893
05:55:45,730 --> 05:55:47,530
That's not that bad.

9894
05:55:47,890 --> 05:55:48,690
I hear him.

9895
05:55:49,750 --> 05:55:51,430
You always hear them.

9896
05:55:51,430 --> 05:55:53,650
You close your eyes and he's there.

9897
05:55:56,910 --> 05:56:00,650
You close your eyes and he'll always be there.

9898
05:56:01,710 --> 05:56:03,430
You guys hate the basalt ones?

9899
05:56:03,530 --> 05:56:03,850
Why?

9900
05:56:03,990 --> 05:56:05,330
Is it because they're annoying to get through?

9901
05:56:07,450 --> 05:56:08,690
But we need to go.

9902
05:56:08,830 --> 05:56:10,130
We need to venture forward.

9903
05:56:11,370 --> 05:56:12,830
We need to find the fortress!

9904
05:56:13,710 --> 05:56:15,290
We need to find the fortress!

9905
05:56:15,790 --> 05:56:16,610
But we're...

9906
05:56:16,610 --> 05:56:17,750
Which way?

9907
05:56:17,750 --> 05:56:17,890
Which way?

9908
05:56:18,990 --> 05:56:20,150
Which way?

9909
05:56:21,370 --> 05:56:22,190
Don't dig up!

9910
05:56:22,290 --> 05:56:23,170
What is wrong with you?

9911
05:56:23,250 --> 05:56:23,970
Don't dig up!

9912
05:56:24,150 --> 05:56:25,550
But there's gold.

9913
05:56:28,730 --> 05:56:30,190
Yeah, it's fair.

9914
05:56:31,490 --> 05:56:35,750
Someone's like basalt equals parkour nether supply station.

9915
05:56:35,750 --> 05:56:36,890
That's true, yes.

9916
05:56:39,670 --> 05:56:41,730
I don't think so.

9917
05:56:43,510 --> 05:56:44,530
I mean, we got the boat.

9918
05:56:44,530 --> 05:56:46,610
I think we gotta go through the basalt.

9919
05:56:49,890 --> 05:56:51,790
We're good at parkour.

9920
05:56:52,210 --> 05:56:53,290
Maybe we go down.

9921
05:56:55,490 --> 05:56:57,450
I'm drinking my lava resistance.

9922
05:56:57,930 --> 05:56:58,210
No!

9923
05:57:01,490 --> 05:57:03,170
The primal no.

9924
05:57:04,610 --> 05:57:05,710
Don't do it!

9925
05:57:06,090 --> 05:57:06,730
Not yet!

9926
05:57:07,550 --> 05:57:09,870
Okay, why don't we get boat and row down?

9927
05:57:10,310 --> 05:57:11,090
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

9928
05:57:11,170 --> 05:57:11,910
Boat and row down.

9929
05:57:11,910 --> 05:57:13,050
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

9930
05:57:13,070 --> 05:57:13,350
Okay.

9931
05:57:17,120 --> 05:57:19,420
Alright, my life is in your hands.

9932
05:57:19,600 --> 05:57:20,520
Wait, are we good?

9933
05:57:21,120 --> 05:57:22,040
Is there anything down there?

9934
05:57:22,080 --> 05:57:25,240
Oh shit, that's really close.

9935
05:57:25,620 --> 05:57:26,020
Wait!

9936
05:57:28,800 --> 05:57:30,280
I don't know if...

9937
05:57:30,280 --> 05:57:31,900
I'm drinking my fire resistance.

9938
05:57:32,540 --> 05:57:34,240
No, don't do it!

9939
05:57:34,400 --> 05:57:36,160
I don't think we should do it.

9940
05:57:36,920 --> 05:57:38,080
Do it, no balls.

9941
05:57:38,480 --> 05:57:40,960
I'm drinking it.

9942
05:57:46,180 --> 05:57:46,740
I'm drinking it.

9943
05:57:46,740 --> 05:57:48,020
Doki, we would've made it.

9944
05:57:48,280 --> 05:57:49,280
Doki, look at this!

9945
05:57:49,740 --> 05:57:50,900
You fucking idiot!

9946
05:57:51,120 --> 05:57:54,260
I didn't drink it, you fucking idiot!

9947
05:57:59,440 --> 05:58:00,660
Okay, then we're fine.

9948
05:58:01,240 --> 05:58:01,900
I take it back.

9949
05:58:02,780 --> 05:58:04,100
I retract my statement.

9950
05:58:04,700 --> 05:58:06,020
Does the baby give you gold?

9951
05:58:07,380 --> 05:58:09,320
Oh, he does!

9952
05:58:09,320 --> 05:58:11,000
What do you give us?

9953
05:58:11,120 --> 05:58:11,420
Baby?

9954
05:58:11,700 --> 05:58:12,280
Little baby?

9955
05:58:12,400 --> 05:58:14,980
What if he's stupid and gives us really great stuff?

9956
05:58:15,400 --> 05:58:16,860
He just took it!

9957
05:58:22,020 --> 05:58:22,900
Kill him.

9958
05:58:23,200 --> 05:58:24,520
No, don't kill him!

9959
05:58:25,220 --> 05:58:26,540
There's no other guys around.

9960
05:58:26,640 --> 05:58:27,300
We can kill him.

9961
05:58:27,620 --> 05:58:28,460
You do it.

9962
05:58:29,360 --> 05:58:30,360
Kill the child.

9963
05:58:30,560 --> 05:58:32,020
There's a guy right next to you.

9964
05:58:32,880 --> 05:58:33,740
He's a zombie.

9965
05:58:39,380 --> 05:58:40,400
I got it back.

9966
05:58:40,400 --> 05:58:41,580
There you go.

9967
05:58:41,640 --> 05:58:42,980
You killed a child.

9968
05:58:43,480 --> 05:58:45,740
I don't care, it's about survival in this mod.

9969
05:58:46,040 --> 05:58:49,840
He got scammed!

9970
05:58:51,840 --> 05:58:54,580
I took it, he just looked at me.

9971
05:58:56,260 --> 05:58:57,640
He was like, yeah.

9972
05:58:59,120 --> 05:59:00,080
Thanks for that.

9973
05:59:00,180 --> 05:59:01,120
The mean present.

9974
05:59:01,560 --> 05:59:06,320
I thought he was gonna be like, I don't know what's worth good stuff in this mod.

9975
05:59:06,440 --> 05:59:07,200
Since I'm a baby.

9976
05:59:07,200 --> 05:59:10,000
I thought that's what he was gonna do.

9977
05:59:10,200 --> 05:59:14,920
He was like, wow, these nice ladies gave me some money.

9978
05:59:16,780 --> 05:59:17,820
So sweet.

9979
05:59:18,100 --> 05:59:19,980
And then you just killed him.

9980
05:59:20,420 --> 05:59:22,400
Yeah, and I'll do it again if he steals your stuff.

9981
05:59:22,540 --> 05:59:23,100
Watch out.

9982
05:59:23,780 --> 05:59:25,060
Watch out, children.

9983
05:59:25,600 --> 05:59:26,640
She's gonna do it.

9984
05:59:27,740 --> 05:59:29,080
She's gonna do it.

9985
05:59:29,240 --> 05:59:30,860
She ain't afraid, there's a hole here.

9986
05:59:31,720 --> 05:59:36,100
Oh, I keep getting tricked and thinking I see a fortress.

9987
05:59:37,380 --> 05:59:39,460
We'll never find the fortress.

9988
05:59:41,660 --> 05:59:43,820
We'll never find the fortress.

9989
05:59:44,140 --> 05:59:44,660
No, we will.

9990
05:59:44,760 --> 05:59:46,680
We have to or else we don't beat the game.

9991
05:59:47,440 --> 05:59:49,040
This is our personal hell.

9992
05:59:49,120 --> 05:59:49,960
This is our nether.

9993
05:59:50,320 --> 05:59:54,220
This is our silent hill.

9994
05:59:55,220 --> 05:59:56,820
This is our silent hill.

9995
05:59:57,220 --> 05:59:58,640
I'm just looking for my wife.

9996
05:59:59,100 --> 06:00:00,360
I'm just looking for you.

9997
06:00:00,580 --> 06:00:01,980
I'm looking for the fortress.

9998
06:00:01,980 --> 06:00:02,140
The fortress.

9999
06:00:04,040 --> 06:00:06,100
The fortress for my wife.

10000
06:00:08,320 --> 06:00:11,540
What is that in front of me?

10001
06:00:12,680 --> 06:00:13,100
No.

10002
06:00:13,840 --> 06:00:17,080
How many fortresses are in the nether?

10003
06:00:21,110 --> 06:00:23,030
Alright, I'm going up.

10004
06:00:25,590 --> 06:00:29,310
Maybe we should go to the right to avoid the...

10005
06:00:29,310 --> 06:00:30,410
Avoid what?

10006
06:00:30,410 --> 06:00:32,110
The basalt area.

10007
06:00:32,850 --> 06:00:34,810
There's only basalt here.

10008
06:00:35,250 --> 06:00:36,870
No, I mean to the other direction.

10009
06:00:37,230 --> 06:00:37,690
This way?

10010
06:00:38,430 --> 06:00:39,030
Or this way?

10011
06:00:39,270 --> 06:00:40,890
Alright, let's do it.

10012
06:00:41,070 --> 06:00:41,990
I'm building up.

10013
06:00:44,110 --> 06:00:46,430
Nothing bad happens when you build up.

10014
06:00:47,330 --> 06:00:49,170
I don't know if that's true or not.

10015
06:00:50,390 --> 06:00:53,750
I like how everyone in my chat was like, I suggest you avoid Basalt.

10016
06:00:55,790 --> 06:00:57,490
Oh, he has all gold.

10017
06:00:57,490 --> 06:00:59,350
Surely he's rich.

10018
06:00:59,510 --> 06:01:01,250
Oh my gosh, royalty.

10019
06:01:01,990 --> 06:01:03,310
He's so fucking rich.

10020
06:01:03,450 --> 06:01:04,210
He's rich.

10021
06:01:07,650 --> 06:01:09,630
He gave me blackstone.

10022
06:01:12,650 --> 06:01:15,850
He gave me gravel.

10023
06:01:17,590 --> 06:01:18,270
There's more.

10024
06:01:18,790 --> 06:01:19,730
Oh, he gave me arrows.

10025
06:01:20,730 --> 06:01:22,090
Wait, me?

10026
06:01:22,210 --> 06:01:22,550
I took them?

10027
06:01:22,810 --> 06:01:24,390
Yeah, it's fine.

10028
06:01:26,350 --> 06:01:27,230
He gave...

10029
06:01:27,230 --> 06:01:28,130
Iron chunks.

10030
06:01:28,350 --> 06:01:29,070
Yeah, that's fine.

10031
06:01:29,170 --> 06:01:30,310
I'll take it.

10032
06:01:32,570 --> 06:01:33,330
Oh, more gravel.

10033
06:01:33,330 --> 06:01:34,270
I got an obsidian.

10034
06:01:34,470 --> 06:01:35,610
I took the obsidian just in case.

10035
06:01:35,610 --> 06:01:36,730
Yeah, we need obsidian.

10036
06:01:38,670 --> 06:01:40,170
And there's more obsidian here.

10037
06:01:40,370 --> 06:01:40,850
You can take this.

10038
06:01:43,070 --> 06:01:44,050
Almost went through that.

10039
06:01:44,810 --> 06:01:45,770
It's not deep, it's okay.

10040
06:01:46,870 --> 06:01:47,670
Okay, where do we go?

10041
06:01:48,790 --> 06:01:49,670
Okay, I'll...

10042
06:01:49,670 --> 06:01:50,770
Take the lead.

10043
06:01:51,510 --> 06:01:53,030
Take the lead.

10044
06:01:53,350 --> 06:01:54,330
Oh, hold on.

10045
06:01:54,450 --> 06:01:55,830
Can we go down here?

10046
06:01:55,910 --> 06:01:58,370
I think we might be able to boat this one.

10047
06:01:58,510 --> 06:01:59,270
Oh, maybe not.

10048
06:02:01,870 --> 06:02:02,830
Here's the boat.

10049
06:02:03,270 --> 06:02:04,250
No, no, not yet.

10050
06:02:04,950 --> 06:02:06,570
Here it is.

10051
06:02:06,750 --> 06:02:08,770
No, I don't think we can.

10052
06:02:09,010 --> 06:02:09,970
I don't think we can.

10053
06:02:10,310 --> 06:02:13,270
Let's dig through here and then we can probably dig out on the other side.

10054
06:02:14,290 --> 06:02:16,050
I think I need some gamer subs.

10055
06:02:16,490 --> 06:02:20,830
Guys, can you use my gamer sub code, Doki Bird, to get...

10056
06:02:21,650 --> 06:02:22,210
Stop digging!

10057
06:02:22,550 --> 06:02:23,490
Stop it, please!

10058
06:02:24,670 --> 06:02:28,510
...to get 15% off of your next order.

10059
06:02:28,610 --> 06:02:29,330
Or is it 10%?

10060
06:02:29,470 --> 06:02:30,030
I don't remember.

10061
06:02:30,130 --> 06:02:31,190
You remember it, right?

10062
06:02:32,250 --> 06:02:33,250
I don't remember.

10063
06:02:33,270 --> 06:02:35,890
It's either 10% or 15%, but it works.

10064
06:02:36,470 --> 06:02:39,130
Do you still get sent stuff by them?

10065
06:02:39,210 --> 06:02:39,930
Yeah, yeah.

10066
06:02:40,070 --> 06:02:41,010
Oh my god.

10067
06:02:41,170 --> 06:02:42,150
I get so much stuff.

10068
06:02:44,690 --> 06:02:46,350
Every promotion they do.

10069
06:02:46,350 --> 06:02:49,090
I think that's for all creators, too.

10070
06:02:49,490 --> 06:02:50,310
We get everything.

10071
06:02:50,590 --> 06:02:52,770
We get the clothes, the...

10072
06:02:52,770 --> 06:02:53,170
Okay.

10073
06:02:54,410 --> 06:02:58,210
The clothes and the gamer subs.

10074
06:02:59,610 --> 06:03:00,370
Everything.

10075
06:03:01,130 --> 06:03:01,550
Yeah.

10076
06:03:02,650 --> 06:03:03,410
Yeah.

10077
06:03:03,510 --> 06:03:05,230
No, I haven't withdrawn my money.

10078
06:03:05,410 --> 06:03:06,250
I have to do that.

10079
06:03:08,350 --> 06:03:15,330
Guys, use the creator code, Doki Bird, Doki Bird, to get 10% off.

10080
06:03:15,330 --> 06:03:17,530
But you guys know what we both have?

10081
06:03:17,650 --> 06:03:18,890
That's the same thing.

10082
06:03:19,030 --> 06:03:20,990
Our Phantom Thief concert!

10083
06:03:21,010 --> 06:03:21,610
Concert!

10084
06:03:22,450 --> 06:03:26,710
We have...

10085
06:03:26,710 --> 06:03:29,070
I almost said...

10086
06:03:30,330 --> 06:03:33,410
Did you almost say that person?

10087
06:03:35,630 --> 06:03:41,070
We have some special guests that are still unannounced.

10088
06:03:44,690 --> 06:03:45,910
Special guests.

10089
06:03:46,030 --> 06:03:47,230
Special guests that are unannounced.

10090
06:03:49,670 --> 06:03:51,670
They are definitely unannounced.

10091
06:03:52,170 --> 06:03:54,230
Very unannounced, very secretive.

10092
06:03:54,390 --> 06:03:56,290
I can't say it.

10093
06:04:01,510 --> 06:04:03,010
Oh my god.

10094
06:04:03,110 --> 06:04:04,330
I'm like the Tom Holland.

10095
06:04:04,330 --> 06:04:04,430
Tom Holland.

10096
06:04:06,850 --> 06:04:08,270
But it'll be fun.

10097
06:04:08,430 --> 06:04:10,150
We'll be in full 3D.

10098
06:04:10,610 --> 06:04:12,590
Oh my god, how did you know I was gonna say Jerma?

10099
06:04:12,770 --> 06:04:13,550
Oh my god.

10100
06:04:16,970 --> 06:04:19,830
Isn't this the big picky area?

10101
06:04:20,630 --> 06:04:21,150
Yes.

10102
06:04:21,630 --> 06:04:23,570
This is the big picky area.

10103
06:04:23,810 --> 06:04:24,930
Your favorite area.

10104
06:04:25,190 --> 06:04:26,350
I don't see any of them.

10105
06:04:27,190 --> 06:04:27,910
I do.

10106
06:04:28,050 --> 06:04:29,150
I see one right there.

10107
06:04:29,250 --> 06:04:30,850
Oh, I see him.

10108
06:04:30,850 --> 06:04:31,790
That'll be fun.

10109
06:04:32,630 --> 06:04:33,770
No, I see him.

10110
06:04:33,850 --> 06:04:34,570
He's on the far right.

10111
06:04:34,670 --> 06:04:35,370
I saw him.

10112
06:04:35,810 --> 06:04:37,430
I looked him in the eye.

10113
06:04:37,650 --> 06:04:39,970
Maybe the fortress is across that.

10114
06:04:41,070 --> 06:04:42,850
Oh, we're gonna be really...

10115
06:04:43,670 --> 06:04:44,030
Maybe.

10116
06:04:45,750 --> 06:04:49,150
Our shields will be super needy here.

10117
06:04:49,270 --> 06:04:51,170
Okay, I believe in us.

10118
06:04:51,530 --> 06:04:52,610
Let's go in.

10119
06:04:53,330 --> 06:04:54,850
We gotta make sacrifices.

10120
06:04:56,150 --> 06:04:57,190
And I have warped fungus.

10121
06:04:58,590 --> 06:05:02,790
Okay, I'll just say that there's a lot of lava over there.

10122
06:05:02,810 --> 06:05:04,810
What if that's above us?

10123
06:05:07,250 --> 06:05:08,050
We're at 91.

10124
06:05:08,210 --> 06:05:09,170
That's kind of high, right?

10125
06:05:09,510 --> 06:05:10,650
Oh, that is high.

10126
06:05:10,710 --> 06:05:11,450
I don't know.

10127
06:05:12,350 --> 06:05:13,610
Oh, we climbed the trees.

10128
06:05:14,010 --> 06:05:14,490
Parkour.

10129
06:05:15,670 --> 06:05:17,510
Wait, we can just go around it, right?

10130
06:05:18,710 --> 06:05:19,870
I'm on the tree.

10131
06:05:21,430 --> 06:05:24,070
Oh, why are you going inside?

10132
06:05:24,490 --> 06:05:26,410
Oh, you left a bunch of...

10133
06:05:26,410 --> 06:05:27,950
You left so much gold here.

10134
06:05:28,070 --> 06:05:28,510
Did I?

10135
06:05:28,910 --> 06:05:29,430
Yeah.

10136
06:05:29,790 --> 06:05:31,730
Oh, I have 64.

10137
06:05:32,030 --> 06:05:32,610
That's why.

10138
06:05:32,790 --> 06:05:33,670
Okay, I'm grabbing it.

10139
06:05:33,710 --> 06:05:35,510
I'm gonna make some gold then.

10140
06:05:36,550 --> 06:05:37,750
Okay, I grabbed it.

10141
06:05:40,370 --> 06:05:41,090
Come back.

10142
06:05:42,310 --> 06:05:43,310
Give me a sec.

10143
06:05:43,350 --> 06:05:44,170
I'm making gold.

10144
06:05:45,370 --> 06:05:46,770
I don't see anyone around.

10145
06:05:47,450 --> 06:05:47,890
Alright.

10146
06:05:49,070 --> 06:05:50,230
Is there anyone up here?

10147
06:05:50,570 --> 06:05:50,810
Hello?

10148
06:05:51,530 --> 06:05:52,010
No?

10149
06:05:52,210 --> 06:05:52,450
Okay.

10150
06:05:53,110 --> 06:05:53,630
Alright.

10151
06:05:56,510 --> 06:05:57,310
Where are we going?

10152
06:05:58,190 --> 06:05:59,870
I think we can go around it.

10153
06:06:00,270 --> 06:06:00,590
Alright.

10154
06:06:01,290 --> 06:06:03,030
Oh, the fortress is across that.

10155
06:06:03,750 --> 06:06:05,370
Well, we'll go around it.

10156
06:06:05,390 --> 06:06:06,250
Here, hold on.

10157
06:06:06,570 --> 06:06:07,870
I have more gold nuggies for you.

10158
06:06:07,910 --> 06:06:08,750
Alright, yeah, I need some.

10159
06:06:08,990 --> 06:06:09,870
Oh my god, that guy.

10160
06:06:10,090 --> 06:06:10,870
You didn't notice, right?

10161
06:06:10,930 --> 06:06:11,410
You didn't see anything?

10162
06:06:12,230 --> 06:06:13,550
Well, does he... No, he's okay.

10163
06:06:14,010 --> 06:06:15,370
I mean, we can give him the gold now.

10164
06:06:15,870 --> 06:06:16,850
Yeah, give him the gold now.

10165
06:06:17,770 --> 06:06:18,310
Go over there.

10166
06:06:18,770 --> 06:06:19,810
Give us stuff, please.

10167
06:06:20,690 --> 06:06:21,610
We're so desperate.

10168
06:06:21,630 --> 06:06:23,410
This is a safe area, so...

10169
06:06:26,810 --> 06:06:27,810
It's quartz.

10170
06:06:30,390 --> 06:06:31,970
This guy is snorting enviously.

10171
06:06:32,310 --> 06:06:33,950
Piglet snorts enviously.

10172
06:06:34,050 --> 06:06:35,890
Oh, the child is jealous.

10173
06:06:36,930 --> 06:06:39,530
I was like, what the fuck is that sound?

10174
06:06:39,730 --> 06:06:39,810
Why did he make all those noises?

10175
06:06:39,810 --> 06:06:40,530
Yeah, I was like, what?

10176
06:06:41,310 --> 06:06:43,510
I was like...

10177
06:06:43,510 --> 06:06:46,770
I was like, that happens?

10178
06:06:47,550 --> 06:06:48,650
What was that?

10179
06:06:48,970 --> 06:06:49,670
That was impressive.

10180
06:06:50,090 --> 06:06:51,910
I've never heard that sound before.

10181
06:06:52,030 --> 06:06:53,290
Oh, he gave me more arrows?

10182
06:06:55,390 --> 06:06:57,010
So if you need some, let me know.

10183
06:06:57,610 --> 06:06:58,370
Oh my god.

10184
06:06:58,530 --> 06:07:00,670
Only does the nether bring us together.

10185
06:07:01,010 --> 06:07:03,290
This is the only time we wanna work together.

10186
06:07:03,290 --> 06:07:05,870
We're finally working together in the nether.

10187
06:07:08,470 --> 06:07:11,050
We've never worked together until now.

10188
06:07:12,410 --> 06:07:14,950
We have one common enemy, and it's the nether.

10189
06:07:15,270 --> 06:07:16,450
Oh my god.

10190
06:07:16,850 --> 06:07:19,570
I just realized my game volume might be really loud.

10191
06:07:23,290 --> 06:07:25,070
Has my game volume been very loud?

10192
06:07:25,150 --> 06:07:25,950
I don't know.

10193
06:07:29,310 --> 06:07:31,330
She gave us two ender pearls!

10194
06:07:32,490 --> 06:07:33,010
Let's go!

10195
06:07:33,350 --> 06:07:34,450
Three ender pearls!

10196
06:07:35,850 --> 06:07:36,110
Whoa!

10197
06:07:38,530 --> 06:07:39,690
Oh, it was okay?

10198
06:07:39,970 --> 06:07:41,290
Okay, that's good to know.

10199
06:07:41,830 --> 06:07:42,830
I was scared there.

10200
06:07:43,770 --> 06:07:45,470
I saw it, I was like, wait, that's a lot.

10201
06:07:45,590 --> 06:07:46,250
That's really high.

10202
06:07:46,270 --> 06:07:47,310
How's my audio been?

10203
06:07:47,550 --> 06:07:48,150
Is it quiet?

10204
06:07:48,270 --> 06:07:48,790
Is it loud?

10205
06:07:49,130 --> 06:07:49,870
I don't know anyway.

10206
06:07:49,930 --> 06:07:50,970
Is this obsidian over there?

10207
06:07:50,970 --> 06:07:52,190
Or blackstone?

10208
06:07:53,090 --> 06:07:53,450
Where?

10209
06:07:55,690 --> 06:07:56,810
Oh, I think it's blackstone.

10210
06:07:57,130 --> 06:07:57,130
I picked up something.

10211
06:07:57,410 --> 06:07:58,630
I don't know what I picked up.

10212
06:08:00,310 --> 06:08:01,690
I don't know anymore.

10213
06:08:03,610 --> 06:08:04,330
I don't...

10214
06:08:04,790 --> 06:08:05,150
Okay.

10215
06:08:06,530 --> 06:08:08,050
No, I don't want blackstone.

10216
06:08:08,150 --> 06:08:09,310
Oh, they're freaking out again.

10217
06:08:09,430 --> 06:08:10,150
They're freaking out.

10218
06:08:10,210 --> 06:08:11,090
They're jealous again.

10219
06:08:11,470 --> 06:08:12,290
Oh, what are they?

10220
06:08:12,370 --> 06:08:12,830
What the hell?

10221
06:08:12,910 --> 06:08:13,950
They're dropping like...

10222
06:08:13,950 --> 06:08:14,530
What is this?

10223
06:08:15,730 --> 06:08:16,450
Soul speed?

10224
06:08:16,530 --> 06:08:17,330
We don't need that.

10225
06:08:17,330 --> 06:08:18,430
Oh, we don't need that.

10226
06:08:19,110 --> 06:08:19,670
What's the other one?

10227
06:08:19,710 --> 06:08:20,330
That's iron.

10228
06:08:20,970 --> 06:08:21,850
Oh, that's my iron?

10229
06:08:25,090 --> 06:08:26,730
Are they both soul speed?

10230
06:08:27,150 --> 06:08:27,970
I think so.

10231
06:08:28,110 --> 06:08:29,650
I think they always bring out soul speed.

10232
06:08:30,750 --> 06:08:32,110
Is this also soul speed?

10233
06:08:32,550 --> 06:08:34,310
Yeah, it's both soul speed.

10234
06:08:34,770 --> 06:08:35,150
Alright.

10235
06:08:35,850 --> 06:08:37,450
I'm ready to leave.

10236
06:08:37,870 --> 06:08:38,390
Onwards.

10237
06:08:39,290 --> 06:08:39,810
Onwards.

10238
06:08:41,570 --> 06:08:42,090
Onwards.

10239
06:08:42,090 --> 06:08:42,290
Onwards.

10240
06:08:44,410 --> 06:08:46,140
Alright, let's try and go around this...

10241
06:08:47,690 --> 06:08:48,610
heckin' forest.

10242
06:08:48,750 --> 06:08:49,690
I hate this thing.

10243
06:08:51,250 --> 06:08:51,590
Okay.

10244
06:08:53,330 --> 06:08:53,790
Yay.

10245
06:08:55,350 --> 06:08:58,370
What's the song that they've been listening to 24-7?

10246
06:08:59,370 --> 06:09:01,590
It's my original song, so they better like it.

10247
06:09:05,210 --> 06:09:05,670
Uh...

10248
06:09:05,670 --> 06:09:08,090
Actually, we can probably build a bridge over this way.

10249
06:09:08,270 --> 06:09:08,570
Alright.

10250
06:09:09,370 --> 06:09:10,210
Oh, never mind.

10251
06:09:10,330 --> 06:09:11,230
I just heard a gas.

10252
06:09:11,410 --> 06:09:12,270
Never mind!

10253
06:09:12,410 --> 06:09:13,710
I thought we were safe!

10254
06:09:15,070 --> 06:09:15,990
They're to our left.

10255
06:09:16,270 --> 06:09:17,990
The gas, it's above us to the left.

10256
06:09:18,350 --> 06:09:19,690
Oh, you know what that means.

10257
06:09:19,810 --> 06:09:21,610
It's time to go through your favorite forest.

10258
06:09:22,570 --> 06:09:25,230
It's time to go through your favorite forest.

10259
06:09:28,050 --> 06:09:29,010
Where is it?

10260
06:09:29,990 --> 06:09:32,030
He literally spawned inside.

10261
06:09:32,450 --> 06:09:32,850
He...

10262
06:09:37,070 --> 06:09:38,170
He's right there.

10263
06:09:38,370 --> 06:09:39,290
He's right there.

10264
06:09:39,610 --> 06:09:41,470
He's right there in the cubby hole.

10265
06:09:42,850 --> 06:09:43,770
There's a cubby hole?

10266
06:09:43,850 --> 06:09:44,530
What are you talking about?

10267
06:09:44,870 --> 06:09:46,850
If you go straight, you'll see him.

10268
06:09:46,890 --> 06:09:47,410
You wanna look at him?

10269
06:09:47,470 --> 06:09:48,770
Come on, I'll show you.

10270
06:09:48,970 --> 06:09:50,090
I'll show you.

10271
06:09:51,950 --> 06:09:52,630
Keep going straight.

10272
06:09:53,150 --> 06:09:53,710
Just go straight.

10273
06:09:53,790 --> 06:09:54,370
Straight here?

10274
06:09:54,570 --> 06:09:55,270
Yeah, just go straight.

10275
06:09:55,350 --> 06:09:55,950
There he is.

10276
06:09:56,030 --> 06:09:57,410
There he is!

10277
06:09:57,430 --> 06:09:59,350
He is in the cubby hole!

10278
06:09:59,350 --> 06:10:00,790
In the cubby hole!

10279
06:10:04,030 --> 06:10:05,210
I told you.

10280
06:10:05,350 --> 06:10:06,370
You didn't believe me.

10281
06:10:07,470 --> 06:10:08,110
Oh my god.

10282
06:10:08,690 --> 06:10:10,810
Oh, I flung it back at him.

10283
06:10:11,590 --> 06:10:13,230
You didn't believe me.

10284
06:10:13,950 --> 06:10:15,050
I told you.

10285
06:10:15,270 --> 06:10:16,750
It was in the cubby hole.

10286
06:10:17,270 --> 06:10:18,970
Oh my god, I keep... Stop moving!

10287
06:10:20,650 --> 06:10:22,650
You hit the fucking...

10288
06:10:22,650 --> 06:10:24,970
Bro, you're pretty good at baseball.

10289
06:10:25,190 --> 06:10:27,390
I got you.

10290
06:10:27,730 --> 06:10:28,290
My turn.

10291
06:10:32,070 --> 06:10:32,510
Ouch!

10292
06:10:33,670 --> 06:10:34,550
Okay, nice.

10293
06:10:36,030 --> 06:10:36,850
Did you drop anything?

10294
06:10:37,450 --> 06:10:37,890
I don't know.

10295
06:10:37,990 --> 06:10:39,070
I'm taking your arrows though.

10296
06:10:39,810 --> 06:10:41,030
Yeah, I'll take my arrows.

10297
06:10:41,190 --> 06:10:43,170
Alright, it's time to go through the forest.

10298
06:10:43,410 --> 06:10:44,790
It's time to go through the forest.

10299
06:10:45,630 --> 06:10:47,110
No, not the forest!

10300
06:10:47,130 --> 06:10:48,910
It's time to go through the forest.

10301
06:10:49,910 --> 06:10:50,710
Oh my gosh.

10302
06:10:50,850 --> 06:10:51,810
Into the thick of it.

10303
06:10:52,150 --> 06:10:53,510
Into the thick of it.

10304
06:10:54,810 --> 06:10:57,550
As we all know, that musical was very...

10305
06:10:57,550 --> 06:10:58,910
It was a very happy musical.

10306
06:11:00,590 --> 06:11:01,830
Why are you going up?

10307
06:11:02,470 --> 06:11:03,870
I'm going to climb the trees.

10308
06:11:04,170 --> 06:11:04,890
Oh, okay.

10309
06:11:04,950 --> 06:11:05,890
We're climbing the trees.

10310
06:11:06,030 --> 06:11:07,310
You can't climb the trees.

10311
06:11:07,510 --> 06:11:09,690
Yes, they actually can spawn up here.

10312
06:11:09,850 --> 06:11:11,230
Yeah, they can spawn here.

10313
06:11:11,230 --> 06:11:12,010
Don't say that.

10314
06:11:12,570 --> 06:11:13,830
I will say it.

10315
06:11:14,790 --> 06:11:17,450
Then they'll start spawning in the trees.

10316
06:11:17,590 --> 06:11:18,690
And then it's your fault.

10317
06:11:19,170 --> 06:11:20,390
Have your shield up.

10318
06:11:20,850 --> 06:11:21,510
Where are you?

10319
06:11:21,890 --> 06:11:23,250
I'm in the trees.

10320
06:11:23,990 --> 06:11:25,270
I'm in the walls.

10321
06:11:25,270 --> 06:11:27,270
You're right below me.

10322
06:11:27,450 --> 06:11:28,930
Oh, you're actually that high?

10323
06:11:29,190 --> 06:11:30,570
Oh, I see one.

10324
06:11:31,570 --> 06:11:32,130
Where?

10325
06:11:33,030 --> 06:11:34,150
Oh, I see you.

10326
06:11:37,230 --> 06:11:39,670
If I stay high ground, they can't get me.

10327
06:11:40,290 --> 06:11:43,310
If I stay up here, they can't get me.

10328
06:11:47,410 --> 06:11:48,530
Cinematic mode.

10329
06:11:49,050 --> 06:11:49,910
Let's go.

10330
06:11:50,810 --> 06:11:55,730
If we die in this run, we have to do all of this again.

10331
06:11:56,110 --> 06:11:56,830
All of this again?

10332
06:11:57,150 --> 06:11:58,690
Just every single seed.

10333
06:11:59,150 --> 06:12:01,130
What if we get like the best seed?

10334
06:12:01,290 --> 06:12:02,690
You know, and it's like super lucky.

10335
06:12:02,770 --> 06:12:04,050
All of this again.

10336
06:12:04,830 --> 06:12:07,090
What if we get like a seed that like...

10337
06:12:07,090 --> 06:12:08,670
Is that the fortress over there?

10338
06:12:09,970 --> 06:12:10,490
Where?

10339
06:12:10,770 --> 06:12:11,410
Over there.

10340
06:12:12,470 --> 06:12:14,290
What is those vine things?

10341
06:12:15,770 --> 06:12:16,810
Vine things?

10342
06:12:17,090 --> 06:12:17,730
Do you see that?

10343
06:12:18,270 --> 06:12:20,610
That's the blue area with all the Endermen.

10344
06:12:21,530 --> 06:12:22,050
Okay.

10345
06:12:25,990 --> 06:12:26,990
It's just an island.

10346
06:12:27,830 --> 06:12:28,870
That's the blue area.

10347
06:12:29,190 --> 06:12:31,950
I thought they were like, I don't know, chains or something.

10348
06:12:32,050 --> 06:12:32,570
Lamps or something?

10349
06:12:32,570 --> 06:12:34,590
Chains from the fortress.

10350
06:12:34,950 --> 06:12:35,610
I don't know.

10351
06:12:35,910 --> 06:12:39,530
I'm just trying to be...

10352
06:12:39,530 --> 06:12:44,150
have like some optimism like these days, but now I'm just...

10353
06:12:44,150 --> 06:12:45,850
I'm a soulless husk right now.

10354
06:12:45,910 --> 06:12:47,930
Now I know why there's so many ghasts here.

10355
06:12:47,930 --> 06:12:50,590
They're all people who are trying to play hardcore Minecraft.

10356
06:12:50,790 --> 06:12:52,430
But they couldn't find the fucking...

10357
06:12:52,430 --> 06:12:54,250
They couldn't find...

10358
06:12:54,250 --> 06:12:55,370
The fucking...

10359
06:12:55,990 --> 06:12:56,870
The fortress.

10360
06:12:57,250 --> 06:12:59,630
I'm gonna...

10361
06:12:59,630 --> 06:13:00,450
Excuse me, sir.

10362
06:13:01,390 --> 06:13:02,610
Should we take the boat down here?

10363
06:13:04,090 --> 06:13:04,970
Oh, um...

10364
06:13:04,970 --> 06:13:06,830
Wait, I'm just checking out the area first.

10365
06:13:07,610 --> 06:13:08,210
Right here.

10366
06:13:08,650 --> 06:13:09,990
Right here where I'm standing.

10367
06:13:10,630 --> 06:13:12,250
I think this is the perfect boat area.

10368
06:13:13,410 --> 06:13:14,150
Might be.

10369
06:13:14,290 --> 06:13:15,190
I'm gonna come with you.

10370
06:13:17,170 --> 06:13:18,130
Oh, gosh.

10371
06:13:18,250 --> 06:13:19,370
I'm putting the boat down.

10372
06:13:19,370 --> 06:13:20,990
For anyone going to bed, good night.

10373
06:13:22,770 --> 06:13:23,730
You can...

10374
06:13:23,730 --> 06:13:26,310
You can check the VOD time in the morning.

10375
06:13:27,550 --> 06:13:28,210
Oh, there you are.

10376
06:13:28,550 --> 06:13:28,930
Alright.

10377
06:13:30,210 --> 06:13:31,850
Wait, how do I get up to you?

10378
06:13:32,250 --> 06:13:34,190
Alright, ready?

10379
06:13:34,950 --> 06:13:36,610
No, I'm not even by you.

10380
06:13:36,910 --> 06:13:37,250
I know.

10381
06:13:37,510 --> 06:13:37,790
Alright.

10382
06:13:39,870 --> 06:13:40,790
Oh my God.

10383
06:13:40,970 --> 06:13:42,890
Why did you position it like this?

10384
06:13:42,890 --> 06:13:43,590
Are you ready?

10385
06:13:43,590 --> 06:13:43,790
Yeah.

10386
06:13:45,190 --> 06:13:46,690
This is our only boat.

10387
06:13:47,390 --> 06:13:48,990
Hey, come on in.

10388
06:13:49,090 --> 06:13:50,110
I know.

10389
06:13:50,770 --> 06:13:52,010
Wait, let me double check.

10390
06:13:52,210 --> 06:13:53,990
Okay, this is actually...

10391
06:13:53,990 --> 06:13:57,030
This is gonna be crazy if we make it.

10392
06:13:57,550 --> 06:14:01,590
I can't see very well, so...

10393
06:14:03,710 --> 06:14:04,470
Here we go.

10394
06:14:04,810 --> 06:14:06,090
This is a 50-50.

10395
06:14:06,310 --> 06:14:08,390
If we make it, it'll be fucking wild.

10396
06:14:09,450 --> 06:14:11,010
Oh my God, thank God.

10397
06:14:11,010 --> 06:14:12,790
Alright, anyway, turn around.

10398
06:14:13,630 --> 06:14:15,870
I don't like this.

10399
06:14:17,270 --> 06:14:18,290
Oh my God.

10400
06:14:18,350 --> 06:14:19,870
We could've landed down there.

10401
06:14:19,890 --> 06:14:22,650
There's two pigs in our boat now, so I'm scared.

10402
06:14:23,270 --> 06:14:24,190
Oh, what the hell?

10403
06:14:24,270 --> 06:14:26,010
These guys are such freeloaders.

10404
06:14:26,630 --> 06:14:29,090
I don't know if I wanna hit that.

10405
06:14:29,730 --> 06:14:31,370
No, we need this boat.

10406
06:14:31,510 --> 06:14:32,230
We need it.

10407
06:14:32,790 --> 06:14:33,790
You hit it.

10408
06:14:34,170 --> 06:14:37,670
I already experienced my first pig invasion.

10409
06:14:38,810 --> 06:14:39,950
Use the pig.

10410
06:14:40,190 --> 06:14:41,570
Wait, am I getting...

10411
06:14:41,570 --> 06:14:43,010
No, I don't wanna get one guy.

10412
06:14:43,570 --> 06:14:45,110
Should the pig be good?

10413
06:14:47,430 --> 06:14:48,690
Oh, I have a lot of wood.

10414
06:14:48,770 --> 06:14:50,650
Do you have a crafting table?

10415
06:14:51,170 --> 06:14:52,790
Okay, we can just make another one.

10416
06:14:53,550 --> 06:14:55,170
I put it next to the boat.

10417
06:14:55,630 --> 06:14:56,390
Abandon ship.

10418
06:14:57,550 --> 06:14:59,270
I put it next to the boat.

10419
06:14:59,530 --> 06:15:00,030
Oh, okay.

10420
06:15:04,070 --> 06:15:04,490
Okay.

10421
06:15:04,490 --> 06:15:06,230
Okay, um...

10422
06:15:06,230 --> 06:15:07,890
A boat.

10423
06:15:11,490 --> 06:15:12,270
Okay, I threw it.

10424
06:15:13,050 --> 06:15:13,750
Is it yours?

10425
06:15:14,170 --> 06:15:14,570
Grab it.

10426
06:15:15,330 --> 06:15:15,770
Grab it.

10427
06:15:16,310 --> 06:15:16,990
Okay, I got it.

10428
06:15:17,450 --> 06:15:18,710
Hold on, I gotta eat.

10429
06:15:20,610 --> 06:15:21,550
What's the plan?

10430
06:15:22,510 --> 06:15:23,950
I think the...

10431
06:15:23,950 --> 06:15:25,230
We can go through this forest.

10432
06:15:25,370 --> 06:15:26,830
This is just the one with all the endermen.

10433
06:15:27,870 --> 06:15:28,850
We go to the right.

10434
06:15:31,750 --> 06:15:32,870
Don't look at them.

10435
06:15:32,870 --> 06:15:35,350
Oh, watch out, because there is a guy down there.

10436
06:15:35,470 --> 06:15:36,330
Hold on.

10437
06:15:38,490 --> 06:15:40,630
Oh my god, another ghast?

10438
06:15:40,670 --> 06:15:41,430
Are you kidding me?

10439
06:15:41,670 --> 06:15:43,010
Why are they all here?

10440
06:15:43,130 --> 06:15:43,850
Why are they here?

10441
06:15:46,250 --> 06:15:47,010
This is so unfair!

10442
06:15:47,610 --> 06:15:50,170
They literally spawn in every biome.

10443
06:15:50,410 --> 06:15:51,530
Give us a break.

10444
06:15:51,910 --> 06:15:53,910
Why did they make this biome harder?

10445
06:15:54,030 --> 06:15:55,110
Why did they make Nether harder?

10446
06:15:55,270 --> 06:15:56,110
I don't understand.

10447
06:15:56,110 --> 06:15:57,030
I don't understand!

10448
06:16:00,130 --> 06:16:00,790
There's a hole.

10449
06:16:02,090 --> 06:16:02,810
There's a hole.

10450
06:16:05,450 --> 06:16:06,910
There's multiple holes.

10451
06:16:07,050 --> 06:16:08,050
There's a lot of holes.

10452
06:16:08,250 --> 06:16:09,930
Oh shit, I think I just aggroed a guy.

10453
06:16:10,870 --> 06:16:11,810
Wait, maybe not.

10454
06:16:12,070 --> 06:16:12,530
Maybe I'm safe.

10455
06:16:13,510 --> 06:16:15,110
I thought I aggroed him.

10456
06:16:17,650 --> 06:16:19,210
There's multiple holes.

10457
06:16:19,710 --> 06:16:21,410
Watch out not to aggro a guy.

10458
06:16:21,630 --> 06:16:23,910
Or be ready to build your own shop.

10459
06:16:26,830 --> 06:16:28,370
Why is there so many?

10460
06:16:30,550 --> 06:16:31,410
Where are you?

10461
06:16:31,590 --> 06:16:32,190
Oh, there you are.

10462
06:16:32,310 --> 06:16:35,510
Don't be careful when you're looking down, because you could accidentally look at them.

10463
06:16:35,590 --> 06:16:36,950
I know, I know!

10464
06:16:39,670 --> 06:16:42,870
Oh my god, I don't want to accidentally look at you.

10465
06:16:42,970 --> 06:16:43,990
You're so ugly.

10466
06:16:44,830 --> 06:16:46,350
I think the Endermen are cute.

10467
06:16:46,610 --> 06:16:48,890
They're literally on this Tumblr sexy man list.

10468
06:16:49,210 --> 06:16:50,710
Wait, are they really?

10469
06:16:51,470 --> 06:16:52,490
I think so, aren't they?

10470
06:16:52,570 --> 06:16:53,370
How do you know?

10471
06:16:54,010 --> 06:16:55,270
How do you know?

10472
06:16:55,350 --> 06:16:56,050
How do you know that?

10473
06:16:57,730 --> 06:16:58,910
How do you know that?

10474
06:16:59,530 --> 06:17:00,770
Oh, you heard it?

10475
06:17:00,830 --> 06:17:01,270
From who?

10476
06:17:02,610 --> 06:17:03,370
I don't know.

10477
06:17:03,570 --> 06:17:04,850
Someone was an expert at it.

10478
06:17:04,870 --> 06:17:05,150
Who?

10479
06:17:06,390 --> 06:17:07,430
I don't know.

10480
06:17:07,670 --> 06:17:08,450
I thought they were.

10481
06:17:08,570 --> 06:17:09,030
Aren't they?

10482
06:17:09,430 --> 06:17:10,690
You don't know.

10483
06:17:11,270 --> 06:17:13,190
Aren't they on there with like...

10484
06:17:13,190 --> 06:17:13,950
What's his name?

10485
06:17:15,570 --> 06:17:16,050
Slenderman?

10486
06:17:17,670 --> 06:17:19,230
They're basically Slenderman.

10487
06:17:20,270 --> 06:17:21,570
I mean, I guess you're right.

10488
06:17:21,570 --> 06:17:22,650
Yeah.

10489
06:17:24,370 --> 06:17:25,490
Is there a fortress here?

10490
06:17:25,490 --> 06:17:27,010
My back is actually starting to hurt.

10491
06:17:27,450 --> 06:17:29,190
Is there a fortress over there?

10492
06:17:29,230 --> 06:17:32,710
Wait, is that a fortress over there?

10493
06:17:32,970 --> 06:17:34,790
No, I can't see.

10494
06:17:35,690 --> 06:17:36,790
I don't know.

10495
06:17:36,910 --> 06:17:39,190
Everything looks like a fortress to me.

10496
06:17:39,730 --> 06:17:41,850
Everything looks like a fortress.

10497
06:17:42,170 --> 06:17:46,770
Now I can't distinguish between what is a fortress and what isn't.

10498
06:17:47,370 --> 06:17:49,790
They all look like one to me.

10499
06:17:49,790 --> 06:17:51,850
Yes, I think it is!

10500
06:17:52,430 --> 06:17:52,850
Where?

10501
06:17:55,630 --> 06:17:56,330
Where are you?

10502
06:17:57,570 --> 06:17:58,470
Where are you?

10503
06:18:00,450 --> 06:18:01,990
Just follow me.

10504
06:18:02,670 --> 06:18:03,650
Oh, there you are.

10505
06:18:06,210 --> 06:18:07,030
I don't know.

10506
06:18:07,210 --> 06:18:08,690
I don't know.

10507
06:18:08,910 --> 06:18:11,030
I don't know what I saw.

10508
06:18:11,630 --> 06:18:12,750
I don't know what was it.

10509
06:18:12,790 --> 06:18:14,610
What did I see that I thought was a fortress?

10510
06:18:14,790 --> 06:18:15,390
I don't know.

10511
06:18:15,610 --> 06:18:16,470
I don't...

10512
06:18:16,470 --> 06:18:16,610
I don't know.

10513
06:18:18,790 --> 06:18:20,630
I don't see one.

10514
06:18:21,350 --> 06:18:22,710
I saw a gas.

10515
06:18:23,290 --> 06:18:24,490
I don't think it was.

10516
06:18:24,750 --> 06:18:27,850
I think even...

10517
06:18:28,470 --> 06:18:31,650
the chat's eyes were freaking out too.

10518
06:18:32,350 --> 06:18:35,430
I think even chat was seeing things.

10519
06:18:35,730 --> 06:18:38,910
It was like we're in the Sahara Desert and I saw a mirage.

10520
06:18:39,370 --> 06:18:40,270
A mirage?

10521
06:18:40,870 --> 06:18:43,870
I saw a mirage.

10522
06:18:46,910 --> 06:18:49,490
This is the freakiest bridge I've ever built.

10523
06:18:49,750 --> 06:18:51,310
Because it's next to a gas.

10524
06:18:52,190 --> 06:18:52,750
A gas?

10525
06:18:53,510 --> 06:18:55,170
Yeah, there was a gas in front of us.

10526
06:18:55,970 --> 06:18:56,930
Where are you?

10527
06:18:57,050 --> 06:18:58,030
Wait, where did you go?

10528
06:18:58,690 --> 06:18:59,350
I don't know.

10529
06:18:59,550 --> 06:19:00,530
I was looking at...

10530
06:19:00,530 --> 06:19:02,290
I was looking for the fortress and you disappeared.

10531
06:19:02,830 --> 06:19:04,390
No, where did you go?

10532
06:19:04,450 --> 06:19:05,870
Wait, wait, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up.

10533
06:19:06,030 --> 06:19:06,710
Build up, build up.

10534
06:19:08,630 --> 06:19:09,430
Look up.

10535
06:19:09,610 --> 06:19:11,230
I'm gonna build the freakiest bridge.

10536
06:19:13,010 --> 06:19:15,170
I'm gonna build the most freaky bridge.

10537
06:19:15,470 --> 06:19:18,310
I don't... I look up and I see a tree.

10538
06:19:18,510 --> 06:19:18,990
Just go up.

10539
06:19:19,110 --> 06:19:20,190
You see my name tag?

10540
06:19:20,290 --> 06:19:20,970
Just go up.

10541
06:19:21,210 --> 06:19:22,710
I don't see your name tag.

10542
06:19:23,010 --> 06:19:23,790
So go up.

10543
06:19:23,910 --> 06:19:25,010
Just go up.

10544
06:19:25,010 --> 06:19:25,890
Oh, there you are.

10545
06:19:26,030 --> 06:19:28,910
Are you sure this is a good idea?

10546
06:19:28,970 --> 06:19:29,390
It's not.

10547
06:19:29,770 --> 06:19:32,170
I'm seeing things now.

10548
06:19:33,250 --> 06:19:34,950
It's not a good idea.

10549
06:19:35,250 --> 06:19:37,570
Are you sure this is a good idea?

10550
06:19:38,110 --> 06:19:40,150
You know what I think is even a worse idea?

10551
06:19:40,870 --> 06:19:41,210
What?

10552
06:19:42,350 --> 06:19:43,130
Get in.

10553
06:19:43,150 --> 06:19:43,370
Okay.

10554
06:19:44,090 --> 06:19:44,810
I'm getting in.

10555
06:19:45,090 --> 06:19:45,650
I'm getting in.

10556
06:19:45,830 --> 06:19:46,630
Get in.

10557
06:19:47,190 --> 06:19:47,810
I'm in.

10558
06:19:47,970 --> 06:19:48,750
I trust you.

10559
06:19:49,050 --> 06:19:51,090
I really don't trust you, but I'm trusting you.

10560
06:19:52,090 --> 06:19:52,910
Here we go.

10561
06:19:53,270 --> 06:19:53,970
Get that boat.

10562
06:19:54,890 --> 06:19:56,770
Look to your right.

10563
06:19:57,030 --> 06:19:57,710
Look to your right.

10564
06:19:58,330 --> 06:19:58,630
Hold on.

10565
06:19:58,650 --> 06:19:59,390
I can't grab it.

10566
06:19:59,470 --> 06:20:00,670
I have no more room.

10567
06:20:00,690 --> 06:20:01,430
Look to your right.

10568
06:20:05,410 --> 06:20:09,610
Yeah, that would've been...

10569
06:20:09,610 --> 06:20:12,170
Everything could've went wrong.

10570
06:20:12,170 --> 06:20:14,230
Yeah, probably.

10571
06:20:14,970 --> 06:20:15,650
Oh, God.

10572
06:20:15,710 --> 06:20:17,350
Oh, my God.

10573
06:20:18,970 --> 06:20:21,310
I'm living life by the edge now.

10574
06:20:23,870 --> 06:20:26,150
We need to make progress.

10575
06:20:26,310 --> 06:20:29,230
And to make progress, we have to take risks.

10576
06:20:29,230 --> 06:20:31,250
I'm going through another sickness now.

10577
06:20:31,490 --> 06:20:33,470
I'm going through another sickness.

10578
06:20:34,330 --> 06:20:35,550
This is just...

10579
06:20:35,550 --> 06:20:37,690
This is the minds all over again.

10580
06:20:39,610 --> 06:20:41,790
Doki is so weak-minded.

10581
06:20:42,650 --> 06:20:44,750
She breaks so easily.

10582
06:20:45,950 --> 06:20:48,690
Write that down in your notes, everybody.

10583
06:20:49,130 --> 06:20:50,510
I'm gonna mind break.

10584
06:20:51,390 --> 06:20:53,610
She mind breaks easily.

10585
06:20:55,550 --> 06:20:57,050
Oh, that's not good.

10586
06:20:57,070 --> 06:20:59,150
I don't have any more bricks.

10587
06:20:59,610 --> 06:21:00,130
I have some.

10588
06:21:00,850 --> 06:21:03,090
Alright, it's your turn to make bridges.

10589
06:21:03,490 --> 06:21:04,750
This is your job now.

10590
06:21:04,750 --> 06:21:07,930
Well, just start mining some because I'm almost out too.

10591
06:21:10,510 --> 06:21:13,550
I mean, I do have other blocks, but I was gonna save them.

10592
06:21:14,430 --> 06:21:16,050
I'm gonna mine some too.

10593
06:21:17,150 --> 06:21:18,810
Yeah, just mine some random ones.

10594
06:21:19,690 --> 06:21:20,770
Just get like a full stack.

10595
06:21:23,790 --> 06:21:26,550
Truly, this is...

10596
06:21:26,550 --> 06:21:28,250
We're not going back home.

10597
06:21:28,350 --> 06:21:30,610
We're not going back home.

10598
06:21:30,770 --> 06:21:33,050
Well, I have two obsidian.

10599
06:21:33,050 --> 06:21:37,050
So if we get however many we need more, then...

10600
06:21:37,650 --> 06:21:41,010
We're never making our way home.

10601
06:21:41,450 --> 06:21:44,930
We never had a home.

10602
06:21:45,510 --> 06:21:47,550
Doki, we never had a home.

10603
06:21:47,850 --> 06:21:49,010
Yes, we did.

10604
06:21:49,470 --> 06:21:52,610
We had that lapis blocks.

10605
06:21:53,110 --> 06:21:55,530
Think about our lapis blocks.

10606
06:21:55,790 --> 06:21:58,450
We can get back to those once we're on the surface.

10607
06:21:58,630 --> 06:22:00,390
We can get anywhere we want to.

10608
06:22:00,390 --> 06:22:01,270
It's so far!

10609
06:22:02,650 --> 06:22:03,530
It's okay!

10610
06:22:05,710 --> 06:22:08,390
Oh my god, Crasher, thank you for the 15 gifted.

10611
06:22:09,090 --> 06:22:09,650
Thank you.

10612
06:22:11,050 --> 06:22:12,650
For our misery.

10613
06:22:14,470 --> 06:22:17,310
How far out is the fortress?

10614
06:22:17,950 --> 06:22:19,290
This is so unlucky.

10615
06:22:19,790 --> 06:22:24,230
I'm ready to just die and just restart the nether.

10616
06:22:24,510 --> 06:22:24,910
No!

10617
06:22:25,490 --> 06:22:27,730
We'll have to get all the diamond over again.

10618
06:22:27,730 --> 06:22:29,410
Please, god, no!

10619
06:22:30,270 --> 06:22:35,230
Getting the diamond is the easy part of this raid.

10620
06:22:39,270 --> 06:22:40,450
I lost you.

10621
06:22:40,610 --> 06:22:42,250
I know you're behind me, okay?

10622
06:22:43,170 --> 06:22:44,930
This is a cursed seed.

10623
06:22:45,170 --> 06:22:47,510
We should have known when we couldn't find a village.

10624
06:22:49,050 --> 06:22:50,670
No, I found villages!

10625
06:22:50,790 --> 06:22:54,490
Oh my gosh, imagine the first one we got was like, oh no, no, we're back in the blue area.

10626
06:22:54,590 --> 06:22:55,930
Doki, we're back in the blue area.

10627
06:22:55,930 --> 06:22:59,570
If we go left, if we go left, if we go left, it'll be fine.

10628
06:23:00,030 --> 06:23:01,430
It's the forest!

10629
06:23:01,630 --> 06:23:02,730
Oh god!

10630
06:23:03,330 --> 06:23:05,470
If we go left, it'll be fine.

10631
06:23:05,710 --> 06:23:07,790
If we go left, it'll be fine.

10632
06:23:08,290 --> 06:23:09,070
Where'd you go?

10633
06:23:09,190 --> 06:23:10,110
I'm in the forest.

10634
06:23:10,350 --> 06:23:11,790
I'm in your favorite place.

10635
06:23:12,090 --> 06:23:12,790
How'd you get in there?

10636
06:23:12,870 --> 06:23:13,170
Which way?

10637
06:23:14,370 --> 06:23:15,470
Oh my god!

10638
06:23:15,890 --> 06:23:16,630
Right here.

10639
06:23:16,750 --> 06:23:16,770
I'm okay.

10640
06:23:17,630 --> 06:23:18,230
I'm right here.

10641
06:23:18,930 --> 06:23:19,590
I'm down.

10642
06:23:21,950 --> 06:23:22,390
Nevermind.

10643
06:23:24,390 --> 06:23:25,330
Oh, I see you.

10644
06:23:25,350 --> 06:23:26,390
I'm right here.

10645
06:23:27,010 --> 06:23:27,570
Hi.

10646
06:23:27,850 --> 06:23:28,950
I'm right here.

10647
06:23:29,290 --> 06:23:29,830
Hi.

10648
06:23:30,890 --> 06:23:34,070
It'd be so funny if we get pushed off the edge right here.

10649
06:23:34,790 --> 06:23:35,990
It'd be so funny.

10650
06:23:36,670 --> 06:23:37,730
We have our potions.

10651
06:23:38,050 --> 06:23:39,150
I'm gonna drink it.

10652
06:23:39,490 --> 06:23:40,310
Don't do it right now.

10653
06:23:40,730 --> 06:23:41,130
I'm gonna drink it.

10654
06:23:41,230 --> 06:23:41,370
Stop.

10655
06:23:41,370 --> 06:23:43,870
I'm gonna fucking drink it.

10656
06:23:44,090 --> 06:23:45,210
Don't do it!

10657
06:23:45,670 --> 06:23:47,170
Why are you gonna do it?

10658
06:23:47,170 --> 06:23:48,890
I'm gonna die anyway!

10659
06:23:52,690 --> 06:23:56,890
I'm doing real parkour moves right here.

10660
06:24:00,020 --> 06:24:00,900
Come on.

10661
06:24:02,460 --> 06:24:04,180
Don't you wanna be a parkour master?

10662
06:24:04,780 --> 06:24:05,380
Okay, nevermind.

10663
06:24:05,460 --> 06:24:06,000
Don't go this way.

10664
06:24:06,140 --> 06:24:06,800
Don't follow me.

10665
06:24:07,120 --> 06:24:07,800
Don't follow me.

10666
06:24:08,980 --> 06:24:10,280
Where did you go?

10667
06:24:11,020 --> 06:24:11,440
I'm here.

10668
06:24:11,560 --> 06:24:11,920
I'm down.

10669
06:24:13,580 --> 06:24:15,500
We have to make a bridge.

10670
06:24:15,760 --> 06:24:16,560
Yeah, we have to make a bridge.

10671
06:24:16,960 --> 06:24:18,520
I have two blocks for this bridge.

10672
06:24:19,820 --> 06:24:21,120
Did you not mine more?

10673
06:24:21,120 --> 06:24:22,320
Mine 20.

10674
06:24:22,480 --> 06:24:23,680
I thought that was okay.

10675
06:24:23,740 --> 06:24:25,300
I told you to get a whole stack.

10676
06:24:27,640 --> 06:24:29,180
A whole stack!

10677
06:24:36,720 --> 06:24:38,720
Has it actually been three hours?

10678
06:24:38,740 --> 06:24:39,260
I don't know.

10679
06:24:39,340 --> 06:24:42,000
It feels like three hours at this point.

10680
06:24:42,180 --> 06:24:44,920
We were in the mines for two, I feel like.

10681
06:24:46,280 --> 06:24:48,020
It's been a six hours stream.

10682
06:24:49,720 --> 06:24:50,640
How long?

10683
06:24:50,800 --> 06:24:52,300
Oh god, six and a half.

10684
06:24:52,300 --> 06:24:54,800
We're not making any progress!

10685
06:24:55,300 --> 06:24:56,620
Oh my god!

10686
06:24:57,700 --> 06:25:00,600
I'm not making any progress!

10687
06:25:01,940 --> 06:25:04,020
I don't understand!

10688
06:25:05,580 --> 06:25:07,120
Uh oh, there's big piggies here.

10689
06:25:08,440 --> 06:25:09,380
Oh, he's angry.

10690
06:25:09,520 --> 06:25:10,860
Oh, he's coming up.

10691
06:25:10,860 --> 06:25:11,260
Oh shit, he's here.

10692
06:25:12,220 --> 06:25:15,660
Oh wait, he's actually coming up.

10693
06:25:16,480 --> 06:25:17,140
They try.

10694
06:25:17,360 --> 06:25:18,000
Where are you?

10695
06:25:18,760 --> 06:25:20,660
Next to the big piggies.

10696
06:25:20,660 --> 06:25:23,540
No, they're blocking the big piggies.

10697
06:25:23,900 --> 06:25:24,420
Oh, I see you.

10698
06:25:24,660 --> 06:25:26,100
I'm down here with the piggies.

10699
06:25:27,000 --> 06:25:29,220
I thought you were scared of the piggies.

10700
06:25:29,580 --> 06:25:30,380
Yeah, I hate them.

10701
06:25:30,500 --> 06:25:32,820
They're fine with shields, honestly, but...

10702
06:25:32,820 --> 06:25:33,460
Oh, here he comes.

10703
06:25:33,540 --> 06:25:33,960
Here he comes.

10704
06:25:37,120 --> 06:25:39,080
Here, I'll put the mushroom down.

10705
06:25:39,620 --> 06:25:41,040
Oh yeah, nice, nice, nice!

10706
06:25:41,100 --> 06:25:42,380
Put the mushroom down!

10707
06:25:42,600 --> 06:25:43,040
Yeah!

10708
06:25:43,280 --> 06:25:47,180
Yeah, get scared dummy!

10709
06:25:47,180 --> 06:25:49,240
I got another one!

10710
06:25:51,740 --> 06:25:52,060
Yeah!

10711
06:25:52,060 --> 06:25:53,220
Scared of a little mushroom!

10712
06:25:54,900 --> 06:25:55,220
Yeah!

10713
06:25:55,960 --> 06:25:56,600
Stupid!

10714
06:25:57,300 --> 06:25:58,820
You're so stupid.

10715
06:25:58,900 --> 06:26:00,660
There you go, here's another one.

10716
06:26:01,340 --> 06:26:02,560
Eat your mushrooms!

10717
06:26:02,580 --> 06:26:03,480
Eat your veggies!

10718
06:26:05,160 --> 06:26:07,200
That's right, eat your veggies!

10719
06:26:08,560 --> 06:26:10,440
Okay, I have more mushrooms for us.

10720
06:26:10,940 --> 06:26:13,760
Oh my god, this is just hellish.

10721
06:26:13,900 --> 06:26:14,800
This is actual hell.

10722
06:26:15,680 --> 06:26:16,380
This is...

10723
06:26:16,380 --> 06:26:18,060
This is the real hell!

10724
06:26:18,060 --> 06:26:19,680
Who invented Minecraft?

10725
06:26:21,580 --> 06:26:23,120
Who invented this?

10726
06:26:24,260 --> 06:26:35,420
I'm gonna go back in time, I will prevent I will prevent Notch from selling Minecraft to Microsoft, so the nether would have never been... Wait, what was Minecraft?

10727
06:26:35,740 --> 06:26:38,200
Was the nether from Notch or from Microsoft?

10728
06:26:38,540 --> 06:26:39,440
I don't know, actually.

10729
06:26:39,580 --> 06:26:40,100
That's what I was gonna say.

10730
06:26:40,140 --> 06:26:41,960
I don't know if this was Microsoft's idea.

10731
06:26:42,180 --> 06:26:43,840
I don't think they have any ideas.

10732
06:26:43,840 --> 06:26:44,480
Guys, who is it?

10733
06:26:44,560 --> 06:26:45,000
I need it.

10734
06:26:45,060 --> 06:26:45,900
Oh, it was Notch.

10735
06:26:46,020 --> 06:26:49,680
Of course, Notch would fucking do this to us, of course.

10736
06:26:52,420 --> 06:26:53,180
Sit down.

10737
06:26:53,380 --> 06:26:53,800
There's some dirt.

10738
06:26:54,020 --> 06:26:54,460
It's okay.

10739
06:26:55,060 --> 06:26:55,640
Oh my god!

10740
06:26:55,720 --> 06:26:56,160
Oh my god!

10741
06:26:56,780 --> 06:26:57,820
Okay, we're fine.

10742
06:27:00,040 --> 06:27:01,100
I got the boat.

10743
06:27:02,540 --> 06:27:03,440
I got the boat.

10744
06:27:03,800 --> 06:27:04,500
We are not going...

10745
06:27:04,500 --> 06:27:05,200
I got the boat.

10746
06:27:05,320 --> 06:27:06,220
Yeah, it'll be fine.

10747
06:27:06,520 --> 06:27:07,300
Okay, that's fine.

10748
06:27:07,480 --> 06:27:07,720
Yeah.

10749
06:27:10,260 --> 06:27:12,720
Oh my god, of course you make me do it.

10750
06:27:13,080 --> 06:27:13,600
Are you in?

10751
06:27:13,940 --> 06:27:14,380
Yeah.

10752
06:27:18,180 --> 06:27:18,620
Okay.

10753
06:27:19,940 --> 06:27:20,780
We're fine.

10754
06:27:21,080 --> 06:27:23,880
I have the mushroom too, in case things go wrong.

10755
06:27:24,060 --> 06:27:24,560
I have them.

10756
06:27:24,560 --> 06:27:25,120
Grab the boat.

10757
06:27:25,260 --> 06:27:25,980
Grab the boat.

10758
06:27:26,120 --> 06:27:27,140
I don't have any room.

10759
06:27:27,360 --> 06:27:29,400
Okay, we go... I feel like we should go forward.

10760
06:27:31,940 --> 06:27:33,240
Okay, what's forward?

10761
06:27:34,000 --> 06:27:34,840
It's like here.

10762
06:27:35,000 --> 06:27:36,540
There's no other way.

10763
06:27:36,880 --> 06:27:39,760
There's no other way in this hell.

10764
06:27:41,320 --> 06:27:42,720
It's really hell.

10765
06:27:45,460 --> 06:27:46,520
Are you okay?

10766
06:27:47,440 --> 06:27:47,980
Yeah.

10767
06:27:48,220 --> 06:27:49,420
No, I'm not okay.

10768
06:27:49,740 --> 06:27:51,120
No, me too.

10769
06:27:52,860 --> 06:27:54,540
Oh my god, don't fall.

10770
06:27:54,720 --> 06:27:55,960
Actually, come down this way.

10771
06:27:56,040 --> 06:27:57,440
I think this way is easier.

10772
06:28:00,340 --> 06:28:00,900
Parkour.

10773
06:28:00,900 --> 06:28:01,460
Parkour.

10774
06:28:02,500 --> 06:28:03,800
Oh my god.

10775
06:28:04,320 --> 06:28:05,760
Why can't we find one?

10776
06:28:07,400 --> 06:28:07,960
Just...

10777
06:28:07,960 --> 06:28:09,460
And then we have to...

10778
06:28:10,300 --> 06:28:11,980
survive in the fortress.

10779
06:28:13,000 --> 06:28:16,640
I feel like, at that point, we'll be okay.

10780
06:28:19,960 --> 06:28:21,120
We were ready.

10781
06:28:21,820 --> 06:28:22,640
We were ready.

10782
06:28:22,860 --> 06:28:24,100
We were ready.

10783
06:28:25,940 --> 06:28:27,140
There's already some here.

10784
06:28:27,460 --> 06:28:29,520
There's some pink ones... or blue ones here.

10785
06:28:29,520 --> 06:28:30,720
I can't even get colors right.

10786
06:28:32,960 --> 06:28:34,100
We can kill him.

10787
06:28:34,240 --> 06:28:34,660
Oh, no.

10788
06:28:34,800 --> 06:28:35,140
We're running.

10789
06:28:35,540 --> 06:28:36,160
No, I don't.

10790
06:28:37,020 --> 06:28:37,320
No.

10791
06:28:38,580 --> 06:28:39,020
No.

10792
06:28:40,880 --> 06:28:41,320
Boom!

10793
06:28:45,820 --> 06:28:47,480
Were you a Costco guy?

10794
06:28:47,520 --> 06:28:47,740
Yeah.

10795
06:28:52,300 --> 06:28:53,060
That's a...

10796
06:28:53,060 --> 06:28:54,280
What do they say?

10797
06:28:54,380 --> 06:28:55,520
That's a...

10798
06:28:56,560 --> 06:28:58,300
I don't remember what they say anymore.

10799
06:28:58,760 --> 06:28:59,140
I don't know.

10800
06:28:59,240 --> 06:28:59,720
Where'd you go?

10801
06:28:59,820 --> 06:29:00,800
I'm over here.

10802
06:29:01,040 --> 06:29:02,400
Where did you go?

10803
06:29:02,880 --> 06:29:03,960
I went left.

10804
06:29:04,080 --> 06:29:05,220
I see you, I see you.

10805
06:29:05,460 --> 06:29:06,400
Boom, baby!

10806
06:29:08,180 --> 06:29:09,060
Bring it on!

10807
06:29:09,400 --> 06:29:09,800
Boom!

10808
06:29:10,740 --> 06:29:11,920
Oh, I see you, I see you.

10809
06:29:12,340 --> 06:29:13,920
Because the other end is a dead end.

10810
06:29:15,680 --> 06:29:17,460
Nothing's a dead end when you can...

10811
06:29:17,460 --> 06:29:17,900
Oh, shit!

10812
06:29:18,600 --> 06:29:20,300
Thank you for the 10 gifted.

10813
06:29:20,960 --> 06:29:21,360
Boom!

10814
06:29:22,160 --> 06:29:22,860
I got him.

10815
06:29:22,860 --> 06:29:23,700
Nice.

10816
06:29:25,380 --> 06:29:27,700
Yeah, nothing's a dead end when you can pick...

10817
06:29:27,700 --> 06:29:28,580
Vine pick through it.

10818
06:29:28,700 --> 06:29:29,160
It's fine.

10819
06:29:29,720 --> 06:29:31,100
Okay, okay, okay.

10820
06:29:31,180 --> 06:29:31,920
That's what you say.

10821
06:29:33,140 --> 06:29:33,540
Boom!

10822
06:29:34,360 --> 06:29:36,040
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

10823
06:29:38,460 --> 06:29:39,220
Oh my God.

10824
06:29:39,540 --> 06:29:40,320
No, don't come here.

10825
06:29:41,680 --> 06:29:42,140
Yeah.

10826
06:29:43,260 --> 06:29:46,260
Wait, does he not hit you even if there's a mushroom there?

10827
06:29:47,040 --> 06:29:47,980
He's too afraid.

10828
06:29:49,680 --> 06:29:50,140
Okay, nice.

10829
06:29:50,140 --> 06:29:50,380
Alright.

10830
06:29:51,480 --> 06:29:53,040
Okay, this is a dead end too.

10831
06:29:53,380 --> 06:29:55,080
We have to mine!

10832
06:29:55,280 --> 06:29:57,160
There's no such thing as a dead end!

10833
06:29:57,380 --> 06:29:58,320
Boom, baby!

10834
06:30:00,360 --> 06:30:02,220
We have to mine too!

10835
06:30:02,520 --> 06:30:05,540
10 gifted, that's a 5 out of 5 booms.

10836
06:30:05,900 --> 06:30:07,960
5 out of 5 booms.

10837
06:30:08,500 --> 06:30:09,000
Booms.

10838
06:30:13,360 --> 06:30:14,460
Come down this way.

10839
06:30:14,700 --> 06:30:19,460
See, look, you've conquered your fear of the big piggies.

10840
06:30:19,580 --> 06:30:20,820
No, I just hate this area.

10841
06:30:21,140 --> 06:30:22,020
I just hate everything.

10842
06:30:22,580 --> 06:30:23,520
I had no fear!

10843
06:30:23,620 --> 06:30:24,840
You conquered it!

10844
06:30:25,380 --> 06:30:28,940
The only thing I hate is no fear!

10845
06:30:29,500 --> 06:30:31,160
You did it!

10846
06:30:31,320 --> 06:30:32,520
Oh my God.

10847
06:30:32,520 --> 06:30:34,980
That's a 5 out of 5 booms, baby.

10848
06:30:37,080 --> 06:30:38,440
We're Costco guys.

10849
06:30:38,720 --> 06:30:41,480
Of course we love the nether.

10850
06:30:42,100 --> 06:30:43,300
Minecraft guys.

10851
06:30:43,300 --> 06:30:44,460
Of course.

10852
06:30:44,640 --> 06:30:46,900
Of course we trade.

10853
06:30:47,760 --> 06:30:48,480
What happened?

10854
06:30:48,760 --> 06:30:49,800
That was so scary.

10855
06:30:49,940 --> 06:30:51,420
They almost knocked us into the lava.

10856
06:30:51,780 --> 06:30:54,460
I just need you to know, they almost knocked you into the lava.

10857
06:30:54,920 --> 06:30:56,140
I saved us.

10858
06:30:56,740 --> 06:30:57,580
Boom, baby.

10859
06:30:59,080 --> 06:31:00,780
Bring in the boom.

10860
06:31:01,080 --> 06:31:03,520
Hoglin growling.

10861
06:31:05,240 --> 06:31:05,840
Okay.

10862
06:31:06,540 --> 06:31:07,520
He comes back!

10863
06:31:09,100 --> 06:31:10,500
On the positive...

10864
06:31:10,500 --> 06:31:13,360
More fortress spawns on the positive side of the X.

10865
06:31:13,840 --> 06:31:15,680
Did we go the wrong way?

10866
06:31:16,100 --> 06:31:16,820
What are you talking about?

10867
06:31:16,900 --> 06:31:17,860
I think that's cap.

10868
06:31:18,740 --> 06:31:20,770
We're at negative 1,000.

10869
06:31:22,700 --> 06:31:24,500
I think they're being stupid.

10870
06:31:25,500 --> 06:31:26,880
That's not true.

10871
06:31:27,320 --> 06:31:28,400
That can't be true.

10872
06:31:29,980 --> 06:31:31,360
Don't say that.

10873
06:31:31,720 --> 06:31:35,000
Because we're at negative 1,500.

10874
06:31:37,480 --> 06:31:39,620
We have gone so far.

10875
06:31:39,620 --> 06:31:41,080
So far, we've definitely been in the positive.

10876
06:31:41,740 --> 06:31:42,460
Oh my God.

10877
06:31:42,520 --> 06:31:44,560
They almost knocked you into that lava.

10878
06:31:44,840 --> 06:31:45,860
I'm just saying.

10879
06:31:46,680 --> 06:31:48,500
I had my shield up.

10880
06:31:49,360 --> 06:31:50,660
Boom, baby.

10881
06:31:53,020 --> 06:31:54,460
Oh my God, and a gas.

10882
06:31:54,660 --> 06:31:55,560
It is true.

10883
06:31:56,220 --> 06:31:58,600
Speedrunners don't use that.

10884
06:32:01,140 --> 06:32:02,320
Okay, guys.

10885
06:32:02,420 --> 06:32:03,000
Don't...

10886
06:32:03,000 --> 06:32:08,200
Why didn't anybody tell us this at the very beginning?

10887
06:32:08,200 --> 06:32:09,380
Guys, look.

10888
06:32:09,460 --> 06:32:12,560
This is not our fault.

10889
06:32:15,500 --> 06:32:18,300
You guys could've told us that.

10890
06:32:18,320 --> 06:32:19,160
We're going west.

10891
06:32:19,260 --> 06:32:20,940
People were like, just go east-west.

10892
06:32:21,060 --> 06:32:23,060
We're going west, so...

10893
06:32:23,060 --> 06:32:24,160
Just mine on through.

10894
06:32:24,760 --> 06:32:26,520
Of course we're Minecraft guys.

10895
06:32:26,900 --> 06:32:30,380
We love trying to find the fortress in the nether.

10896
06:32:45,910 --> 06:32:46,430
Oh my God.

10897
06:32:46,430 --> 06:32:47,050
Please stop.

10898
06:32:51,810 --> 06:32:57,950
Oh my God.

10899
06:32:58,230 --> 06:33:00,610
If it was just a stream that was just like...

10900
06:33:00,610 --> 06:33:03,450
Don't give in trying to find the fortress.

10901
06:33:03,730 --> 06:33:04,670
That's one thing.

10902
06:33:05,150 --> 06:33:06,670
But no, we have to find the fortress.

10903
06:33:07,110 --> 06:33:08,350
We have to survive the fortress.

10904
06:33:08,790 --> 06:33:09,770
We have to leave the fortress.

10905
06:33:09,770 --> 06:33:11,710
We have to go to the end.

10906
06:33:11,810 --> 06:33:13,130
We have to fight the ender dragon.

10907
06:33:13,830 --> 06:33:14,930
Boom, baby.

10908
06:33:16,350 --> 06:33:17,930
I gotta find boom.

10909
06:33:24,150 --> 06:33:27,590
No, apparently Google says it's true.

10910
06:33:28,550 --> 06:33:29,190
I don't...

10911
06:33:29,190 --> 06:33:31,610
Google says that you can...

10912
06:33:31,610 --> 06:33:33,070
Yeah, yeah.

10913
06:33:33,230 --> 06:33:35,830
You're like, I filled that hole because that was a hole there.

10914
06:33:36,590 --> 06:33:36,630
I know.

10915
06:33:36,630 --> 06:33:37,790
Thank you.

10916
06:33:38,070 --> 06:33:39,270
Because Google says what?

10917
06:33:40,250 --> 06:33:42,290
Google says that like...

10918
06:33:42,290 --> 06:33:43,590
What was it?

10919
06:33:45,790 --> 06:33:49,430
It's a thing that says you can eat it, but it's like a bandage or whatever.

10920
06:33:49,670 --> 06:33:51,830
Oh yeah, because of the AI thing.

10921
06:33:52,290 --> 06:33:54,610
The Google AI shit is like so wrong.

10922
06:33:54,810 --> 06:33:56,310
Put glue on your pizza.

10923
06:33:58,190 --> 06:34:00,370
I don't feel so good about this area.

10924
06:34:00,610 --> 06:34:01,330
Oh, the dressing.

10925
06:34:01,530 --> 06:34:05,650
Yeah, it says the dressing you can put in your salad and then it's also a bandage.

10926
06:34:06,910 --> 06:34:07,790
I see.

10927
06:34:07,970 --> 06:34:10,490
I think we can make a bridge here.

10928
06:34:11,630 --> 06:34:12,170
Alright.

10929
06:34:13,770 --> 06:34:15,150
Or we could go up.

10930
06:34:15,330 --> 06:34:16,050
Do you wanna go up?

10931
06:34:18,010 --> 06:34:19,590
But we're at 47.

10932
06:34:20,750 --> 06:34:22,470
47 where the fortress is?

10933
06:34:22,870 --> 06:34:24,650
I don't know where the fortress is.

10934
06:34:24,670 --> 06:34:26,930
Guys, is 47 a good for a fortress?

10935
06:34:29,690 --> 06:34:31,630
Double chocolate cookie.

10936
06:34:34,430 --> 06:34:35,030
Boo.

10937
06:34:49,490 --> 06:34:52,070
Now I can see why hawk tool is funny.

10938
06:34:57,510 --> 06:34:59,770
Do we build up?

10939
06:35:01,290 --> 06:35:02,890
You wanna build up?

10940
06:35:02,890 --> 06:35:04,030
I don't know.

10941
06:35:04,210 --> 06:35:05,490
What do you wanna do?

10942
06:35:06,850 --> 06:35:08,410
Build up or go straight?

10943
06:35:08,790 --> 06:35:09,830
I think we go straight.

10944
06:35:10,070 --> 06:35:11,450
Alright, let's do it.

10945
06:35:13,190 --> 06:35:14,690
Just keep going west.

10946
06:35:14,830 --> 06:35:15,970
Eventually we'll hit it.

10947
06:35:16,210 --> 06:35:19,850
We either fall to our deaths or we fucking hit the jackpot.

10948
06:35:20,870 --> 06:35:23,410
Oh my god, the lava is glowing so much.

10949
06:35:23,450 --> 06:35:24,410
It's so beautiful, Doki.

10950
06:35:24,730 --> 06:35:26,030
It's calling for us.

10951
06:35:26,250 --> 06:35:27,670
I'm like a moth to a flame.

10952
06:35:28,010 --> 06:35:29,590
I'm like a moth to a flame.

10953
06:35:30,390 --> 06:35:32,590
It's calling to us.

10954
06:35:32,710 --> 06:35:33,810
It's calling to us.

10955
06:35:34,210 --> 06:35:37,430
Take the jump.

10956
06:35:37,530 --> 06:35:37,630
Take the jump.

10957
06:35:37,790 --> 06:35:38,130
Take the jump.

10958
06:35:39,790 --> 06:35:41,010
Do it.

10959
06:35:41,210 --> 06:35:43,430
Your chat will think it's so funny.

10960
06:35:48,810 --> 06:35:51,630
Don't you guys want to make content?

10961
06:35:52,310 --> 06:35:54,430
You know you love content.

10962
06:35:55,630 --> 06:35:57,090
Take the jump.

10963
06:35:58,230 --> 06:35:59,890
Oh my god.

10964
06:36:01,050 --> 06:36:02,630
I'm getting sleepy.

10965
06:36:03,070 --> 06:36:04,330
Just give up right now.

10966
06:36:04,970 --> 06:36:05,870
Just give up.

10967
06:36:06,090 --> 06:36:07,990
Start a new seed.

10968
06:36:08,430 --> 06:36:12,210
A new seed will surely be easier than this one.

10969
06:36:13,230 --> 06:36:15,130
Maybe the next seed will be easier.

10970
06:36:18,230 --> 06:36:19,750
Start over.

10971
06:36:20,230 --> 06:36:23,090
Start over again.

10972
06:36:23,090 --> 06:36:23,810
Start over again.

10973
06:36:25,350 --> 06:36:26,710
Go through the mines.

10974
06:36:26,910 --> 06:36:29,470
Strip mining was so much easier than this.

10975
06:36:30,910 --> 06:36:33,510
Don't you just want to do it over and over again?

10976
06:36:34,030 --> 06:36:35,770
Just keep doing it.

10977
06:36:36,050 --> 06:36:38,410
Keep doing it.

10978
06:36:38,770 --> 06:36:40,010
Keep dying.

10979
06:36:40,690 --> 06:36:41,410
Restart.

10980
06:36:45,490 --> 06:36:49,070
Why is the forest so far?

10981
06:36:49,790 --> 06:36:50,570
I don't know.

10982
06:36:50,570 --> 06:36:51,810
That's why I hate this area.

10983
06:36:51,950 --> 06:36:54,190
Because it's hard to navigate and it's huge.

10984
06:36:54,770 --> 06:36:57,910
I didn't know last time we were here it wasn't this big.

10985
06:36:59,310 --> 06:37:00,750
We're in unknown territory.

10986
06:37:01,310 --> 06:37:04,110
We've been in unknown territory for like forever.

10987
06:37:04,490 --> 06:37:06,330
Like when does it start becoming known?

10988
06:37:06,990 --> 06:37:09,210
When does it start becoming known?

10989
06:37:09,370 --> 06:37:09,890
When?

10990
06:37:12,330 --> 06:37:13,470
Where did you go?

10991
06:37:13,710 --> 06:37:16,030
I'm in front of you.

10992
06:37:16,170 --> 06:37:16,930
I'm in front of you.

10993
06:37:17,570 --> 06:37:18,930
I'm in front of you.

10994
06:37:19,310 --> 06:37:20,650
What's in front of me?

10995
06:37:20,710 --> 06:37:22,150
Just go forward.

10996
06:37:23,450 --> 06:37:24,610
Oh, I see you.

10997
06:37:29,750 --> 06:37:31,490
I did the bridge.

10998
06:37:31,750 --> 06:37:33,350
I did the bridge.

10999
06:37:34,150 --> 06:37:36,170
This is the most painful.

11000
06:37:36,490 --> 06:37:37,850
This will...

11001
06:37:37,850 --> 06:37:40,250
Nothing ever would turn me off of Minecraft.

11002
06:37:52,570 --> 06:37:55,410
Why is there so many?

11003
06:37:56,110 --> 06:37:58,370
It's the worst biome, I'm telling you.

11004
06:37:58,610 --> 06:37:59,610
You can't see shit.

11005
06:38:00,730 --> 06:38:02,390
You can't see shit.

11006
06:38:02,650 --> 06:38:04,650
And also, it goes on forever.

11007
06:38:05,150 --> 06:38:06,970
I didn't know.

11008
06:38:07,930 --> 06:38:09,910
You were like, let's go through the forest.

11009
06:38:10,070 --> 06:38:12,170
You hate the forest.

11010
06:38:12,290 --> 06:38:13,150
It's so fast.

11011
06:38:13,610 --> 06:38:17,250
I was thinking like, what if...

11012
06:38:17,250 --> 06:38:18,250
What if...

11013
06:38:19,410 --> 06:38:21,470
There's a baby in front of you.

11014
06:38:23,990 --> 06:38:25,450
Baby is gonna be scared.

11015
06:38:25,530 --> 06:38:26,510
Oh, I got the mushrooms.

11016
06:38:27,690 --> 06:38:28,730
I killed him.

11017
06:38:29,470 --> 06:38:30,670
Yeah, I killed the baby.

11018
06:38:32,410 --> 06:38:33,390
That's fucking right.

11019
06:38:33,530 --> 06:38:34,010
Look at that.

11020
06:38:34,090 --> 06:38:34,690
Oh, he's running.

11021
06:38:36,650 --> 06:38:38,150
Yeah, that's fucking right.

11022
06:38:38,250 --> 06:38:38,810
That's right.

11023
06:38:39,270 --> 06:38:40,930
You're scared of your vegetables?

11024
06:38:41,450 --> 06:38:42,250
That's right.

11025
06:38:42,250 --> 06:38:43,890
Yeah, get scared.

11026
06:38:43,910 --> 06:38:44,290
That's right.

11027
06:38:44,810 --> 06:38:46,150
Your mother is dead.

11028
06:38:46,250 --> 06:38:46,950
We killed her.

11029
06:38:47,910 --> 06:38:48,690
What the hell?

11030
06:38:49,350 --> 06:38:51,270
Alright, where do we go?

11031
06:38:51,870 --> 06:38:52,450
Onwards?

11032
06:38:52,610 --> 06:38:53,270
Oh, gosh.

11033
06:38:53,350 --> 06:38:54,250
Go away, little baby.

11034
06:38:54,290 --> 06:38:54,990
Go away!

11035
06:38:55,350 --> 06:38:56,250
We're gonna fucking...

11036
06:38:56,890 --> 06:38:58,230
kick the baby again.

11037
06:38:58,590 --> 06:39:00,250
We're still headed west.

11038
06:39:00,350 --> 06:39:02,110
We're still west.

11039
06:39:02,290 --> 06:39:04,170
What's the worst that can happen?

11040
06:39:07,310 --> 06:39:08,270
Are you okay?

11041
06:39:09,270 --> 06:39:10,290
Are you okay?

11042
06:39:10,870 --> 06:39:11,250
Are you okay?

11043
06:39:12,550 --> 06:39:15,430
I don't think okay is the right word.

11044
06:39:21,180 --> 06:39:22,140
Go west.

11045
06:39:22,880 --> 06:39:25,760
Eventually, if we keep going west, something will hit.

11046
06:39:26,680 --> 06:39:31,620
Why would they make it so that more fortresses spawn in the positive?

11047
06:39:31,800 --> 06:39:33,440
When does it circle back?

11048
06:39:34,080 --> 06:39:36,340
It has to circle back eventually.

11049
06:39:36,440 --> 06:39:38,220
I don't think you can circle back.

11050
06:39:38,220 --> 06:39:38,440
Why?

11051
06:39:39,560 --> 06:39:41,180
So we just turn around?

11052
06:39:42,700 --> 06:39:44,080
We gotta get obsidian.

11053
06:39:45,860 --> 06:39:47,440
Make another obsidian.

11054
06:39:48,260 --> 06:39:49,820
I don't know anymore.

11055
06:39:50,280 --> 06:39:51,000
Where are we?

11056
06:39:55,000 --> 06:40:00,480
Apparently, the x-axis thing was before 1.16, so it's old news.

11057
06:40:00,720 --> 06:40:01,940
Oh, thank God.

11058
06:40:01,960 --> 06:40:03,340
Oh, thank God.

11059
06:40:04,220 --> 06:40:05,680
We're just unlucky.

11060
06:40:06,720 --> 06:40:11,500
One fortress can spawn every 432x432 chunks.

11061
06:40:12,520 --> 06:40:13,300
Oh my gosh.

11062
06:40:13,620 --> 06:40:14,760
We're fine then.

11063
06:40:14,860 --> 06:40:15,840
We can just keep going.

11064
06:40:16,060 --> 06:40:17,020
Just keep going.

11065
06:40:17,560 --> 06:40:20,440
Your chat was trying to feed us wrong information, Doki.

11066
06:40:20,720 --> 06:40:24,980
Your chat was saying the same thing!

11067
06:40:25,260 --> 06:40:26,060
No, it wasn't!

11068
06:40:29,380 --> 06:40:30,380
Which way?

11069
06:40:32,880 --> 06:40:34,140
Which way?

11070
06:40:34,440 --> 06:40:37,000
You give us the seed so we can look it for you?

11071
06:40:37,140 --> 06:40:37,380
No!

11072
06:40:38,020 --> 06:40:39,680
We're not cheating!

11073
06:40:39,920 --> 06:40:42,460
We're not cheaters!

11074
06:40:43,400 --> 06:40:44,300
Come on.

11075
06:40:46,000 --> 06:40:47,040
I'm here.

11076
06:40:47,240 --> 06:40:47,740
I'm here.

11077
06:40:48,180 --> 06:40:49,480
We're not cheaters.

11078
06:40:50,260 --> 06:40:51,080
We're here.

11079
06:40:53,820 --> 06:40:54,460
Yippee.

11080
06:40:56,500 --> 06:40:57,140
Yippee.

11081
06:40:58,660 --> 06:40:59,300
Yippee.

11082
06:40:59,300 --> 06:41:00,100
Yippee.

11083
06:41:01,720 --> 06:41:02,280
Yippee.

11084
06:41:03,240 --> 06:41:05,640
We have integrity!

11085
06:41:06,620 --> 06:41:07,100
Take that.

11086
06:41:07,480 --> 06:41:08,760
Oh wait, be careful.

11087
06:41:08,940 --> 06:41:09,840
Actually, maybe don't.

11088
06:41:11,740 --> 06:41:12,780
Too risky.

11089
06:41:15,840 --> 06:41:18,360
Wait, did you see the piglin snorted angrily?

11090
06:41:19,660 --> 06:41:21,000
He didn't notice though.

11091
06:41:21,140 --> 06:41:21,480
We're inside.

11092
06:41:23,020 --> 06:41:26,680
I think we'll be fine.

11093
06:41:26,680 --> 06:41:27,400
We'll be fine.

11094
06:41:27,620 --> 06:41:28,580
He'll get tired.

11095
06:41:31,100 --> 06:41:32,120
I'm tired.

11096
06:41:32,440 --> 06:41:33,140
No, you're not.

11097
06:41:34,320 --> 06:41:35,140
No, you're not.

11098
06:41:35,560 --> 06:41:38,000
If we die, you gotta stay up.

11099
06:41:38,200 --> 06:41:39,800
If we die, you gotta stay up.

11100
06:41:40,000 --> 06:41:42,300
If we die...

11101
06:41:42,300 --> 06:41:45,820
If we die, you gotta keep going!

11102
06:41:45,820 --> 06:41:45,880
Yay!

11103
06:41:54,100 --> 06:41:59,120
Hold on, I'm gonna go to the side and see if there's any fortresses.

11104
06:41:59,440 --> 06:42:00,540
There's another...

11105
06:42:00,540 --> 06:42:03,180
There's another forest.

11106
06:42:03,520 --> 06:42:04,960
There's another forest.

11107
06:42:07,520 --> 06:42:10,100
Let's see if there's any fortresses yonder.

11108
06:42:11,620 --> 06:42:12,760
Oh my gosh.

11109
06:42:13,980 --> 06:42:14,960
Fortress please!

11110
06:42:15,660 --> 06:42:17,640
How the fuck did a chicken get here?

11111
06:42:18,200 --> 06:42:18,920
What the hell?

11112
06:42:19,040 --> 06:42:20,360
How is there another chicken?

11113
06:42:20,900 --> 06:42:23,160
Is that fortress over there?

11114
06:42:23,920 --> 06:42:24,240
Where?

11115
06:42:24,940 --> 06:42:25,900
Over there.

11116
06:42:26,900 --> 06:42:27,840
Over there.

11117
06:42:27,940 --> 06:42:29,180
Is this another mirage?

11118
06:42:29,480 --> 06:42:31,400
Am I looking at a mirage right now?

11119
06:42:31,520 --> 06:42:33,140
Everything looks like a fortress.

11120
06:42:33,900 --> 06:42:35,260
Is this a mirage?

11121
06:42:36,540 --> 06:42:37,660
I don't know.

11122
06:42:39,600 --> 06:42:41,000
I don't know.

11123
06:42:41,000 --> 06:42:42,360
I don't know.

11124
06:42:42,500 --> 06:42:46,140
Keep my render distance the way it is because otherwise... What is that?

11125
06:42:47,220 --> 06:42:48,420
Let's start selecting him.

11126
06:42:48,820 --> 06:42:49,340
What's what?

11127
06:42:49,600 --> 06:42:50,200
It's just land.

11128
06:42:52,400 --> 06:42:53,900
It's more land.

11129
06:42:54,800 --> 06:42:56,460
There's a ghast behind us.

11130
06:42:58,580 --> 06:42:59,660
Oh, I see him.

11131
06:43:01,520 --> 06:43:04,000
I'm not ready to deal with his bullshit today.

11132
06:43:05,200 --> 06:43:06,300
Oh my god!

11133
06:43:07,420 --> 06:43:08,120
I got him.

11134
06:43:08,920 --> 06:43:10,380
I got him.

11135
06:43:10,620 --> 06:43:12,100
I locked in.

11136
06:43:14,980 --> 06:43:16,340
I got him.

11137
06:43:17,620 --> 06:43:18,620
I got him.

11138
06:43:18,840 --> 06:43:19,780
I got him.

11139
06:43:22,320 --> 06:43:25,200
Can you believe Doki wanted to start this later in the day?

11140
06:43:27,140 --> 06:43:28,660
I didn't realize.

11141
06:43:28,820 --> 06:43:29,840
Wait, is that...

11142
06:43:29,840 --> 06:43:31,700
Is that the fortress over there?

11143
06:43:31,900 --> 06:43:32,420
Stop!

11144
06:43:36,300 --> 06:43:37,560
Do you want to go?

11145
06:43:37,840 --> 06:43:39,620
We can just build a bridge.

11146
06:43:39,880 --> 06:43:42,600
We can just build a bridge all the way there.

11147
06:43:42,720 --> 06:43:43,300
Come on.

11148
06:43:44,020 --> 06:43:44,820
Let's go.

11149
06:43:46,220 --> 06:43:46,980
Come on.

11150
06:43:47,060 --> 06:43:48,620
We can build a bridge and see.

11151
06:43:48,820 --> 06:43:49,880
Is it that over there?

11152
06:43:50,140 --> 06:43:52,900
It definitely is not, but we can go check.

11153
06:43:54,800 --> 06:43:55,400
I'm just...

11154
06:43:55,400 --> 06:43:58,240
I'm just trying something here.

11155
06:43:59,140 --> 06:44:00,180
I'm trying...

11156
06:44:00,180 --> 06:44:02,200
I'm trying something!

11157
06:44:02,660 --> 06:44:06,600
It's like somebody wants to just give up!

11158
06:44:10,500 --> 06:44:11,880
You're yawning.

11159
06:44:12,380 --> 06:44:13,300
You're yawning.

11160
06:44:13,780 --> 06:44:14,500
You're yawning.

11161
06:44:14,720 --> 06:44:17,540
You're a west coaster!

11162
06:44:18,100 --> 06:44:19,240
You're a west coaster!

11163
06:44:20,960 --> 06:44:22,580
She's going crazy!

11164
06:44:23,000 --> 06:44:24,540
She has nethering madness!

11165
06:44:25,000 --> 06:44:26,620
She has nethering madness!

11166
06:44:31,270 --> 06:44:33,710
And you call me weak-minded?

11167
06:44:34,870 --> 06:44:37,030
This is my first breakdown, okay?

11168
06:44:38,470 --> 06:44:40,910
Okay, I actually think we should build over there though.

11169
06:44:42,070 --> 06:44:45,190
Because going over lava, it's high risk but high reward.

11170
06:44:45,450 --> 06:44:46,090
Oh, it's true.

11171
06:44:46,250 --> 06:44:47,470
You're so right.

11172
06:44:47,870 --> 06:44:50,050
We build a double bridge.

11173
06:44:50,250 --> 06:44:51,470
Wait, do you have enough things?

11174
06:44:52,370 --> 06:44:53,490
You do?

11175
06:44:56,130 --> 06:44:57,210
Where should we go?

11176
06:44:57,210 --> 06:44:59,530
I'm drinking fire resistance.

11177
06:45:00,550 --> 06:45:01,210
No, you're not.

11178
06:45:01,610 --> 06:45:03,050
Only drink it if you start falling.

11179
06:45:03,430 --> 06:45:06,010
I'm not gonna get it off in time!

11180
06:45:07,950 --> 06:45:08,950
Here I go.

11181
06:45:09,670 --> 06:45:10,650
Here you go.

11182
06:45:10,730 --> 06:45:11,530
Into the thick of it!

11183
06:45:11,810 --> 06:45:13,510
Into the thick of it!

11184
06:45:14,110 --> 06:45:15,290
Into the thick of it!

11185
06:45:20,570 --> 06:45:23,410
My fingers get sweaty.

11186
06:45:23,410 --> 06:45:25,590
Into the thick of it!

11187
06:45:26,170 --> 06:45:29,610
Okay, you have to tell me if I'm gonna back into a lava thing though.

11188
06:45:30,850 --> 06:45:32,150
Just say stop.

11189
06:45:33,010 --> 06:45:34,530
Yeah, just tell me though.

11190
06:45:34,890 --> 06:45:35,850
Tell me to stop.

11191
06:45:36,590 --> 06:45:38,250
If I start going.

11192
06:45:40,750 --> 06:45:42,130
Looks like a bastion?

11193
06:45:42,390 --> 06:45:43,690
Oh my god!

11194
06:45:43,830 --> 06:45:44,570
Oh, it is!

11195
06:45:45,470 --> 06:45:47,730
No, I literally told you that earlier!

11196
06:45:49,410 --> 06:45:51,190
No way, that's a freaking...

11197
06:45:51,190 --> 06:45:54,490
We found two bastions but not a fortress!

11198
06:45:57,290 --> 06:45:59,150
This is so unfair!

11199
06:45:59,970 --> 06:46:02,050
I thought the bastions were the big piggies.

11200
06:46:03,350 --> 06:46:05,530
They're the most dangerous part.

11201
06:46:06,370 --> 06:46:07,250
But there's more piggies?

11202
06:46:07,250 --> 06:46:10,110
All those guys in there, all those guys will kill you.

11203
06:46:11,390 --> 06:46:13,150
They don't care if you're wearing gold.

11204
06:46:15,330 --> 06:46:16,850
Yeah, they just attack.

11205
06:46:18,250 --> 06:46:19,310
How do we keep...

11206
06:46:19,310 --> 06:46:20,150
Let's go left.

11207
06:46:22,390 --> 06:46:24,050
I guess we go left.

11208
06:46:24,510 --> 06:46:25,590
Do you think it's the same one?

11209
06:46:25,650 --> 06:46:26,570
I don't think so.

11210
06:46:26,750 --> 06:46:27,330
There's no way.

11211
06:46:27,410 --> 06:46:28,010
Did we go back?

11212
06:46:28,450 --> 06:46:30,310
No, wait, I think it is.

11213
06:46:30,370 --> 06:46:31,510
Do you see those blue flames?

11214
06:46:32,070 --> 06:46:33,050
Is that the bones?

11215
06:46:33,910 --> 06:46:37,470
We've gone too far for us to have made a circle.

11216
06:46:39,430 --> 06:46:40,290
Okay, turn around.

11217
06:46:40,490 --> 06:46:40,710
Turn around.

11218
06:46:40,710 --> 06:46:41,930
Turn around.

11219
06:46:42,530 --> 06:46:42,970
No.

11220
06:46:46,870 --> 06:46:47,470
No.

11221
06:46:50,510 --> 06:46:52,470
I'm too sick of it.

11222
06:46:52,970 --> 06:46:54,450
I'm too sick of it.

11223
06:46:54,670 --> 06:46:56,570
I'm too sick of it.

11224
06:46:56,910 --> 06:46:58,930
I hear you're going left and right.

11225
06:46:59,610 --> 06:47:01,230
I'm too sick of it.

11226
06:47:01,490 --> 06:47:02,910
I'm too sick of it.

11227
06:47:04,350 --> 06:47:05,310
Oh my God.

11228
06:47:05,430 --> 06:47:06,850
Oh, we made out just in time.

11229
06:47:06,990 --> 06:47:08,130
Holy shoot.

11230
06:47:08,130 --> 06:47:09,810
Oh my God.

11231
06:47:09,890 --> 06:47:11,070
Oh my God.

11232
06:47:11,270 --> 06:47:12,570
Let's just keep going through the wood.

11233
06:47:12,650 --> 06:47:13,430
I don't care anymore.

11234
06:47:14,030 --> 06:47:15,750
I got the mushrooms.

11235
06:47:16,150 --> 06:47:17,770
I got the mushrooms.

11236
06:47:18,270 --> 06:47:19,550
We have nine mushrooms.

11237
06:47:20,530 --> 06:47:22,090
I'm too sick of it.

11238
06:47:22,410 --> 06:47:24,170
I'm too sick of it.

11239
06:47:25,090 --> 06:47:26,530
Why is he chasing after you?

11240
06:47:26,790 --> 06:47:27,390
Okay, that's weird.

11241
06:47:29,990 --> 06:47:30,550
Okay.

11242
06:47:31,990 --> 06:47:33,690
We're still going west, everybody.

11243
06:47:34,390 --> 06:47:35,590
Turn it to the west.

11244
06:47:35,590 --> 06:47:38,090
Turn it to the west.

11245
06:47:38,970 --> 06:47:39,650
See this?

11246
06:47:39,950 --> 06:47:40,410
Bam!

11247
06:47:41,590 --> 06:47:42,210
Ha-ha!

11248
06:47:42,770 --> 06:47:44,730
He thwarted fool.

11249
06:47:45,530 --> 06:47:47,030
Now we have to get past him still though.

11250
06:47:47,770 --> 06:47:48,610
Boom!

11251
06:47:49,410 --> 06:47:49,930
Run!

11252
06:47:50,730 --> 06:47:51,290
Double choke!

11253
06:47:52,250 --> 06:47:53,090
But,

11254
06:47:58,830 --> 06:47:59,630
where'd you go?

11255
06:48:00,290 --> 06:48:01,850
I'm gonna...

11256
06:48:01,850 --> 06:48:03,210
Oh my God.

11257
06:48:03,210 --> 06:48:04,330
I'm gonna crack.

11258
06:48:04,450 --> 06:48:05,570
I'm gonna crack.

11259
06:48:05,850 --> 06:48:07,790
I'm gonna crack.

11260
06:48:12,490 --> 06:48:13,530
It's okay.

11261
06:48:13,850 --> 06:48:15,370
Everything will be fine.

11262
06:48:16,490 --> 06:48:16,950
I got him.

11263
06:48:17,070 --> 06:48:17,710
I got him.

11264
06:48:17,710 --> 06:48:19,710
I think...

11265
06:48:21,450 --> 06:48:22,990
I can go for you.

11266
06:48:26,890 --> 06:48:28,510
I'm too sick of it.

11267
06:48:30,150 --> 06:48:31,210
Where'd you go?

11268
06:48:31,310 --> 06:48:31,830
Oh my gosh.

11269
06:48:32,390 --> 06:48:33,370
Where are you?

11270
06:48:33,510 --> 06:48:34,010
I'm here.

11271
06:48:34,570 --> 06:48:35,270
Keep going.

11272
06:48:35,410 --> 06:48:36,350
Keep going straight.

11273
06:48:38,970 --> 06:48:40,890
I got cabin fever.

11274
06:48:43,490 --> 06:48:45,710
All I see is red.

11275
06:48:45,710 --> 06:48:47,270
All I see is red everywhere.

11276
06:48:48,410 --> 06:48:48,910
I don't understand.

11277
06:48:49,210 --> 06:48:51,610
I don't even know what fortresses look like anymore.

11278
06:48:51,770 --> 06:48:53,190
I feel like it's just a myth.

11279
06:48:54,030 --> 06:48:55,170
It's just a myth.

11280
06:48:55,770 --> 06:48:57,150
They aren't even real.

11281
06:48:57,370 --> 06:49:02,530
They were invented by big crafter.

11282
06:49:08,710 --> 06:49:09,750
Big crafter.

11283
06:49:09,950 --> 06:49:10,790
Big crafter invented...

11284
06:49:10,790 --> 06:49:12,070
Made them...

11285
06:49:13,010 --> 06:49:14,110
Oh my God.

11286
06:49:14,150 --> 06:49:15,330
They're turning the pigs gay.

11287
06:49:15,330 --> 06:49:18,010
Wait, I think we should stick to...

11288
06:49:19,950 --> 06:49:23,810
We should stick to the edge where we see the big pool of lava.

11289
06:49:24,050 --> 06:49:24,290
Okay.

11290
06:49:24,830 --> 06:49:27,350
Also, look how big the...

11291
06:49:27,350 --> 06:49:29,250
Look how big...

11292
06:49:29,250 --> 06:49:30,650
What?

11293
06:49:30,890 --> 06:49:31,970
What are you even saying?

11294
06:49:32,350 --> 06:49:35,070
Look how much forest this is.

11295
06:49:35,210 --> 06:49:35,730
I know.

11296
06:49:35,970 --> 06:49:37,770
That's why I hate this modem.

11297
06:49:38,350 --> 06:49:40,510
I hate this modem so much.

11298
06:49:41,350 --> 06:49:43,130
They're turning the pigs...

11299
06:49:43,130 --> 06:49:44,590
Gay in the lava.

11300
06:49:47,630 --> 06:49:49,710
Oh my God.

11301
06:49:50,310 --> 06:49:52,930
Bastion is like tempting, but...

11302
06:49:52,930 --> 06:49:54,230
It's not our goal.

11303
06:49:54,730 --> 06:49:56,070
It's not our goal.

11304
06:49:58,110 --> 06:49:59,770
Oh my God, please.

11305
06:50:00,450 --> 06:50:01,190
If there...

11306
06:50:01,190 --> 06:50:04,690
I went to heaven, but if there is a God...

11307
06:50:07,790 --> 06:50:08,230
Please.

11308
06:50:11,930 --> 06:50:12,650
What the hell?

11309
06:50:12,710 --> 06:50:13,430
Who just yelled at me?

11310
06:50:14,230 --> 06:50:14,730
Where are you?

11311
06:50:14,970 --> 06:50:16,970
Oh, I see you.

11312
06:50:20,030 --> 06:50:20,750
I'm checking.

11313
06:50:20,930 --> 06:50:22,230
I'm being on the lookout for...

11314
06:50:24,790 --> 06:50:25,750
For fortresses.

11315
06:50:25,810 --> 06:50:26,970
Into the thick of it.

11316
06:50:27,210 --> 06:50:28,330
Into the thick of it.

11317
06:50:30,650 --> 06:50:31,130
Oh

11318
06:50:35,670 --> 06:50:36,390
my God.

11319
06:50:36,630 --> 06:50:37,390
Where are we?

11320
06:50:39,430 --> 06:50:40,910
We're in the thick of it.

11321
06:50:42,690 --> 06:50:44,470
We're in the thick of it.

11322
06:50:44,830 --> 06:50:46,530
The music is gone.

11323
06:50:46,630 --> 06:50:47,710
Just like my sanity.

11324
06:50:48,770 --> 06:50:49,990
Why does your music keep disappearing?

11325
06:50:50,290 --> 06:50:51,670
It's a YouTube playlist.

11326
06:50:52,230 --> 06:50:54,550
Oh, did you put on Minecraft music or something?

11327
06:50:54,650 --> 06:50:56,990
No, it's like the thing where if you leave it on...

11328
06:50:56,990 --> 06:50:59,310
Like you leave your playlist on unintended...

11329
06:50:59,310 --> 06:51:01,310
It like pauses it because they're like, are you alive?

11330
06:51:01,730 --> 06:51:03,410
Oh, it does the Netflix thing?

11331
06:51:03,890 --> 06:51:04,890
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

11332
06:51:04,990 --> 06:51:05,630
It does that.

11333
06:51:06,890 --> 06:51:08,090
I don't know if I should...

11334
06:51:08,090 --> 06:51:10,010
I'm running out of blocks.

11335
06:51:11,110 --> 06:51:12,370
It's so shiny.

11336
06:51:12,670 --> 06:51:14,110
I just want to jump into it.

11337
06:51:14,190 --> 06:51:15,690
It'd be so funny though.

11338
06:51:16,370 --> 06:51:17,190
I'm gonna do it.

11339
06:51:19,390 --> 06:51:21,220
You could continue on without me.

11340
06:51:21,610 --> 06:51:22,570
I'm gonna do it.

11341
06:51:24,030 --> 06:51:24,810
No, you're not.

11342
06:51:24,810 --> 06:51:25,590
I'm gonna do it.

11343
06:51:27,030 --> 06:51:28,830
Wait, why are you going that way?

11344
06:51:28,850 --> 06:51:30,810
I'm gonna do it.

11345
06:51:32,110 --> 06:51:33,710
Do you believe?

11346
06:51:34,570 --> 06:51:36,170
Do you believe?

11347
06:51:36,870 --> 06:51:37,990
I can't see your POV.

11348
06:51:38,070 --> 06:51:38,710
I don't believe.

11349
06:51:38,890 --> 06:51:41,070
I'm gonna drink the fire resistance.

11350
06:51:41,530 --> 06:51:42,750
Don't take it!

11351
06:51:44,190 --> 06:51:45,530
Here we go.

11352
06:51:46,090 --> 06:51:47,050
Oh, you made it.

11353
06:51:47,070 --> 06:51:49,190
I thought you said you didn't see me.

11354
06:51:50,030 --> 06:51:50,710
No, I see you.

11355
06:51:50,710 --> 06:51:51,730
No, I don't see where you...

11356
06:51:51,730 --> 06:51:52,830
I didn't see where you were gonna land.

11357
06:51:52,910 --> 06:51:55,810
It looked like you were gonna land into a lava.

11358
06:51:56,430 --> 06:51:57,170
Oh, yeah.

11359
06:51:57,290 --> 06:51:59,770
No, there was a chance.

11360
06:52:01,150 --> 06:52:02,530
Okay, let's split up, gang.

11361
06:52:03,190 --> 06:52:04,610
We've already split up.

11362
06:52:04,650 --> 06:52:05,290
Let's split up.

11363
06:52:05,730 --> 06:52:07,550
No, that's the worst idea.

11364
06:52:07,630 --> 06:52:08,890
One of us will die.

11365
06:52:09,330 --> 06:52:12,890
Then we'll do this all over again.

11366
06:52:14,030 --> 06:52:16,950
We're gonna do this all over again.

11367
06:52:17,390 --> 06:52:18,330
How much...

11368
06:52:19,010 --> 06:52:20,370
Probability is me.

11369
06:52:21,630 --> 06:52:27,430
Okay, how much do you think we would owe chat if we told them that we didn't want to do this anymore?

11370
06:52:27,830 --> 06:52:29,350
No, we have to!

11371
06:52:32,830 --> 06:52:34,650
We're not quitters!

11372
06:52:36,390 --> 06:52:36,690
Mint.

11373
06:52:37,530 --> 06:52:39,350
Mint, you got this.

11374
06:52:39,450 --> 06:52:41,670
You knew the time commitment.

11375
06:52:43,270 --> 06:52:43,910
Okay, where are you?

11376
06:52:43,950 --> 06:52:44,850
I'm coming back to you.

11377
06:52:47,270 --> 06:52:48,390
I'm in the air.

11378
06:52:48,390 --> 06:52:50,590
You probably could see my little bridge.

11379
06:52:50,690 --> 06:52:51,810
My sky bridge.

11380
06:52:51,830 --> 06:52:54,730
Oh my god, you made a fucking sky bridge.

11381
06:52:55,350 --> 06:52:57,090
Mint, it's time to get the gamer subs out.

11382
06:52:57,330 --> 06:52:57,830
It's time.

11383
06:52:58,650 --> 06:52:59,510
It's time.

11384
06:52:59,550 --> 06:53:01,050
It's time to get the gamer subs out.

11385
06:53:01,270 --> 06:53:02,130
Are you actually?

11386
06:53:02,350 --> 06:53:05,250
I will drink the gamer subs if you drink the gamer subs.

11387
06:53:05,770 --> 06:53:07,210
I have so much gamer subs.

11388
06:53:07,430 --> 06:53:10,450
I think I will actually have gamer subs for like five years.

11389
06:53:10,990 --> 06:53:11,390
Exactly.

11390
06:53:11,850 --> 06:53:12,490
It's time.

11391
06:53:14,070 --> 06:53:15,190
Are you gonna go get some?

11392
06:53:15,190 --> 06:53:17,130
I'll get some when we meet up.

11393
06:53:17,250 --> 06:53:18,910
When we reconvene.

11394
06:53:18,910 --> 06:53:20,310
Okay, come to me then.

11395
06:53:20,350 --> 06:53:20,950
Where are you?

11396
06:53:21,230 --> 06:53:22,790
I'm in the thick of it.

11397
06:53:23,310 --> 06:53:24,250
Then come to me.

11398
06:53:24,310 --> 06:53:27,910
I told you to stay along the edge so we could see if we see any.

11399
06:53:28,750 --> 06:53:32,270
You know I don't know anymore.

11400
06:53:33,570 --> 06:53:39,110
I'm trying to not die.

11401
06:53:39,510 --> 06:53:40,730
I see you.

11402
06:53:41,470 --> 06:53:41,970
You do?

11403
06:53:43,090 --> 06:53:45,270
Okay, I'm gonna go get something to drink actually.

11404
06:53:45,370 --> 06:53:46,250
Because I'm dehydrated.

11405
06:53:47,650 --> 06:53:49,650
I'll make gamer subs later.

11406
06:53:49,890 --> 06:53:51,910
No, no, make it.

11407
06:53:52,730 --> 06:53:53,830
We can take a break.

11408
06:53:54,250 --> 06:53:55,110
No, no, no.

11409
06:53:55,230 --> 06:53:56,250
I'm in the thick of it.

11410
06:53:56,370 --> 06:53:57,470
I'm panning over to you.

11411
06:53:57,830 --> 06:53:58,850
Wait, what's your name?

11412
06:53:59,330 --> 06:54:00,350
I'm in a fortress.

11413
06:54:00,550 --> 06:54:01,790
I'm in a fortress that I created.

11414
06:54:02,430 --> 06:54:04,990
I said the wrong one.

11415
06:54:05,370 --> 06:54:06,270
Don't say that.

11416
06:54:06,610 --> 06:54:08,990
You gave me hope for a second.

11417
06:54:08,990 --> 06:54:11,030
You gave me...

11418
06:54:11,030 --> 06:54:12,570
You gave me hope for...

11419
06:54:12,570 --> 06:54:14,230
Okay, while...

11420
06:54:14,230 --> 06:54:16,950
You go make your drink.

11421
06:54:17,150 --> 06:54:18,630
And then after you make your drink.

11422
06:54:19,050 --> 06:54:21,610
I entertain chat while you make drink.

11423
06:54:22,030 --> 06:54:23,150
And then after you make drink.

11424
06:54:23,250 --> 06:54:25,230
You come back and then I...

11425
06:54:26,610 --> 06:54:30,170
And then I need to walk my dog.

11426
06:54:30,390 --> 06:54:31,430
And then...

11427
06:54:31,430 --> 06:54:33,190
And then we go on.

11428
06:54:33,690 --> 06:54:36,070
Wait, how long is a dog walk?

11429
06:54:36,150 --> 06:54:37,190
It's like 10 minutes.

11430
06:54:37,190 --> 06:54:37,910
10 minutes.

11431
06:54:38,050 --> 06:54:39,610
He just needs to pee and poop.

11432
06:54:41,270 --> 06:54:42,270
And then...

11433
06:54:42,270 --> 06:54:44,250
You've never had a dog before?

11434
06:54:44,770 --> 06:54:46,990
I have, but like...

11435
06:54:46,990 --> 06:54:47,990
I just would...

11436
06:54:47,990 --> 06:54:49,550
My mom took care of him.

11437
06:54:50,250 --> 06:54:51,570
You're not responsible.

11438
06:54:52,550 --> 06:54:54,810
We would just let her out and...

11439
06:54:54,810 --> 06:54:55,930
They'd run around.

11440
06:54:57,350 --> 06:54:58,790
Go make your tea.

11441
06:54:58,970 --> 06:54:59,890
He's gotta pee and poop.

11442
06:55:00,890 --> 06:55:01,750
Okay, I'm going.

11443
06:55:04,870 --> 06:55:05,910
Oh my god.

11444
06:55:05,910 --> 06:55:06,670
Okay, guys.

11445
06:55:07,010 --> 06:55:08,990
Guys, how...

11446
06:55:08,990 --> 06:55:10,290
Oh my god, please.

11447
06:55:10,690 --> 06:55:11,730
Please stop.

11448
06:55:11,950 --> 06:55:12,630
Get away.

11449
06:55:13,250 --> 06:55:14,490
Oh, he's gonna hit him.

11450
06:55:14,610 --> 06:55:15,350
He's gonna kill him.

11451
06:55:15,450 --> 06:55:16,070
Oh, thank god.

11452
06:55:16,190 --> 06:55:17,670
Please kill that stupid pig.

11453
06:55:17,770 --> 06:55:19,150
Will you stop killing him?

11454
06:55:19,530 --> 06:55:20,790
Why did you stop?

11455
06:55:23,330 --> 06:55:24,490
Wait, I lost her.

11456
06:55:24,550 --> 06:55:25,310
Oh, there she is.

11457
06:55:25,370 --> 06:55:25,650
Okay.

11458
06:55:26,810 --> 06:55:29,990
I gotta grab more of these.

11459
06:55:29,990 --> 06:55:32,450
Sit in and grab my...

11460
06:55:32,450 --> 06:55:34,230
Where's the piggies?

11461
06:55:34,570 --> 06:55:35,710
Wait, is that...

11462
06:55:35,710 --> 06:55:37,430
Is that the...

11463
06:55:37,430 --> 06:55:39,170
Oh no, that's the gas.

11464
06:55:39,590 --> 06:55:40,330
When...

11465
06:55:40,330 --> 06:55:43,650
When will I find a fortress?

11466
06:55:48,410 --> 06:55:50,650
I'm gonna make my own house.

11467
06:55:51,010 --> 06:55:52,230
I'm gonna make...

11468
06:55:52,230 --> 06:55:54,010
My own little house.

11469
06:55:58,480 --> 06:56:00,800
I gotta make my house.

11470
06:56:00,800 --> 06:56:02,280
Gotta...

11471
06:56:02,280 --> 06:56:02,780
No.

11472
06:56:03,500 --> 06:56:05,920
No, I'm not a cheater.

11473
06:56:08,340 --> 06:56:10,860
Okay, I got my safe house.

11474
06:56:11,360 --> 06:56:13,360
Never give up.

11475
06:56:14,440 --> 06:56:16,360
Never back down.

11476
06:56:17,360 --> 06:56:18,800
I'm sorry.

11477
06:56:19,240 --> 06:56:19,800
Dad.

11478
06:56:20,140 --> 06:56:21,340
I'm sorry.

11479
06:56:21,540 --> 06:56:24,160
I know you wanna be in poop.

11480
06:56:24,360 --> 06:56:25,000
I'm sorry.

11481
06:56:26,320 --> 06:56:27,660
Give me a sec.

11482
06:56:27,740 --> 06:56:29,540
I can walk you soon.

11483
06:56:29,540 --> 06:56:31,820
I can walk you soon.

11484
06:56:34,020 --> 06:56:37,840
Are fortresses normally this hard?

11485
06:56:39,540 --> 06:56:42,420
Are they normally this hard to find?

11486
06:56:42,860 --> 06:56:43,980
I don't understand.

11487
06:56:44,760 --> 06:56:46,020
I don't understand.

11488
06:56:47,600 --> 06:56:50,620
Are they normally this difficult?

11489
06:56:53,820 --> 06:56:54,400
No.

11490
06:56:55,420 --> 06:56:56,580
No.

11491
06:56:56,580 --> 06:56:58,380
What's wrong with us?

11492
06:56:58,780 --> 06:56:59,420
What's...

11493
06:56:59,420 --> 06:57:01,260
What's wrong with us?

11494
06:57:08,300 --> 06:57:10,260
I don't know.

11495
06:57:14,450 --> 06:57:15,400
I don't know.

11496
06:57:16,320 --> 06:57:17,520
I don't...

11497
06:57:17,520 --> 06:57:19,820
I don't know why we can't...

11498
06:57:19,820 --> 06:57:21,240
I don't know why we can't...

11499
06:57:21,240 --> 06:57:23,920
We can't find a single fortress.

11500
06:57:24,220 --> 06:57:25,820
It's like the frogs all over again.

11501
06:57:25,820 --> 06:57:29,180
It's like the frogs all over again.

11502
06:57:33,090 --> 06:57:35,390
Look in open areas.

11503
06:57:37,010 --> 06:57:37,850
Okay.

11504
06:57:38,670 --> 06:57:39,510
Okay.

11505
06:57:39,850 --> 06:57:41,810
There's so many people fighting.

11506
06:57:44,210 --> 06:57:45,050
Okay.

11507
06:57:45,750 --> 06:57:46,070
Alright.

11508
06:57:48,550 --> 06:57:49,390
Okay.

11509
06:57:51,310 --> 06:57:52,210
Oh, we're going...

11510
06:57:52,210 --> 06:57:54,110
Okay, we just gotta go in the open area.

11511
06:57:54,350 --> 06:57:55,950
We just...

11512
06:57:56,730 --> 06:57:57,950
We just need to go...

11513
06:57:59,010 --> 06:57:59,750
Okay, alright.

11514
06:57:59,890 --> 06:58:01,490
Now it's your turn to talk to the chat.

11515
06:58:01,710 --> 06:58:03,590
I'm gonna go walk him.

11516
06:58:03,930 --> 06:58:05,230
And then make my gamer subs.

11517
06:58:05,310 --> 06:58:06,090
I'll be right back.

11518
06:58:06,770 --> 06:58:10,130
Oh my god, a guy spawned on my...

11519
06:58:10,130 --> 06:58:15,240
I got some more mac and cheese, guys.

11520
06:58:21,450 --> 06:58:23,010
I've come to the...

11521
06:58:25,110 --> 06:58:25,910
What's the word?

11522
06:58:26,530 --> 06:58:27,490
Not the realization.

11523
06:58:28,250 --> 06:58:30,690
I've come with peace that this might ruin my sleep schedule.

11524
06:58:33,990 --> 06:58:36,610
I want to stream tomorrow, but...

11525
06:58:36,610 --> 06:58:37,930
It might be more Minecraft.

11526
06:58:42,410 --> 06:58:43,710
Give us the seed.

11527
06:58:43,810 --> 06:58:44,050
No!

11528
06:58:45,250 --> 06:58:45,790
No!

11529
06:58:48,270 --> 06:58:50,610
I refuse to give you the seed.

11530
06:58:53,790 --> 06:58:54,850
I refuse.

11531
06:58:57,930 --> 06:58:59,310
Don't keep proposing this.

11532
06:58:59,370 --> 06:59:01,220
I thought we were gonna start in the morning.

11533
06:59:03,210 --> 06:59:04,770
What was he thinking?

11534
06:59:08,820 --> 06:59:11,300
Doki, I wake up at 10am every morning.

11535
06:59:15,930 --> 06:59:18,850
My sleep schedule is not broken like yours.

11536
06:59:22,350 --> 06:59:23,930
She had too much confidence.

11537
06:59:24,250 --> 06:59:25,190
Yeah, I think so.

11538
06:59:39,410 --> 06:59:40,910
I'm just eating my dinner.

11539
06:59:43,670 --> 06:59:45,110
Where even is she?

11540
06:59:45,890 --> 06:59:47,310
Like, where did she...

11541
06:59:47,310 --> 06:59:49,970
Look at this guy taking over my...

11542
06:59:49,970 --> 06:59:51,130
My bridge.

11543
06:59:53,190 --> 06:59:55,150
We don't mind a second stream.

11544
06:59:57,550 --> 07:00:01,890
If it comes down to it, we have to...

11545
07:00:03,190 --> 07:00:04,730
She's in the ground.

11546
07:00:05,630 --> 07:00:06,870
What is this hobbit...

11547
07:00:06,870 --> 07:00:07,830
What is she doing?

11548
07:00:08,970 --> 07:00:10,730
She's a groundhog now?

11549
07:00:14,390 --> 07:00:15,650
I'm gonna keep going.

11550
07:00:17,510 --> 07:00:19,030
I'm gonna keep going.

11551
07:00:21,210 --> 07:00:22,450
But I need more.

11552
07:00:24,850 --> 07:00:26,710
I don't wanna waste all my deep sleep.

11553
07:00:28,870 --> 07:00:29,870
For these, you know?

11554
07:00:30,330 --> 07:00:31,850
These are good against like...

11555
07:00:31,850 --> 07:00:34,230
I can get more, I guess.

11556
07:00:35,790 --> 07:00:36,030
No!

11557
07:00:38,190 --> 07:00:39,470
She's six feet under.

11558
07:00:41,330 --> 07:00:42,510
I wish that were me.

11559
07:00:42,910 --> 07:00:44,390
Actually, can she and I trade places?

11560
07:00:46,050 --> 07:00:47,610
Can she and I trade places?

11561
07:00:48,510 --> 07:00:49,610
I guess I can drop here.

11562
07:00:51,550 --> 07:00:53,630
Did she go further than me?

11563
07:00:53,690 --> 07:00:54,290
I don't know.

11564
07:00:54,850 --> 07:00:55,330
Oh wait!

11565
07:00:55,730 --> 07:00:56,730
Oh my gosh, there she is!

11566
07:00:59,790 --> 07:01:00,630
Doki Birdo.

11567
07:01:02,550 --> 07:01:03,710
I found her.

11568
07:01:04,210 --> 07:01:04,950
That's so funny.

11569
07:01:09,110 --> 07:01:10,270
Oh my gosh.

11570
07:01:12,490 --> 07:01:13,050
More...

11571
07:01:13,050 --> 07:01:15,050
Okay, blue forest is fine.

11572
07:01:16,330 --> 07:01:18,210
We don't mind the blue forest.

11573
07:01:18,970 --> 07:01:20,910
Here, I'll even make the bridge over there.

11574
07:01:21,390 --> 07:01:22,190
I'll be productive.

11575
07:01:23,550 --> 07:01:24,810
While we wait.

11576
07:01:25,030 --> 07:01:25,630
Oh my god.

11577
07:01:26,350 --> 07:01:27,470
I'll be productive, everybody.

11578
07:01:28,050 --> 07:01:29,530
Doki stream, you may not be able to see.

11579
07:01:31,630 --> 07:01:32,330
But trust.

11580
07:01:33,110 --> 07:01:33,950
Trust in me.

11581
07:01:34,530 --> 07:01:35,730
That I'm making a bridge.

11582
07:01:36,230 --> 07:01:37,310
Across the sea.

11583
07:01:41,640 --> 07:01:42,120
I'm...

11584
07:01:42,120 --> 07:01:43,200
Almost there.

11585
07:01:45,440 --> 07:01:48,040
We'll find the fortress and we'll live.

11586
07:01:48,200 --> 07:01:48,880
We'll survive.

11587
07:01:49,120 --> 07:01:49,940
It's the two of us.

11588
07:01:50,080 --> 07:01:51,340
We can do it.

11589
07:01:51,860 --> 07:01:53,480
It's the two of us.

11590
07:01:56,100 --> 07:01:57,580
It's the two of us.

11591
07:01:57,700 --> 07:01:59,440
We have to be able to.

11592
07:02:07,520 --> 07:02:08,760
Oh my god, no.

11593
07:02:09,180 --> 07:02:09,520
Gassed.

11594
07:02:09,520 --> 07:02:10,620
Gassed.

11595
07:02:11,080 --> 07:02:12,300
I swear, go away.

11596
07:02:12,760 --> 07:02:14,600
Oh my god, I hear him.

11597
07:02:14,660 --> 07:02:15,980
He's like right next to me.

11598
07:02:16,800 --> 07:02:17,360
No.

11599
07:02:18,380 --> 07:02:19,640
Oh my gosh.

11600
07:02:21,280 --> 07:02:21,560
Believe.

11601
07:02:22,920 --> 07:02:24,920
Believe in magic.

11602
07:02:26,740 --> 07:02:27,800
Guys, okay.

11603
07:02:27,960 --> 07:02:29,060
I'm just gonna say it.

11604
07:02:29,380 --> 07:02:30,580
I'm just gonna say it.

11605
07:02:30,800 --> 07:02:33,080
We've gone through every biome but the basalt.

11606
07:02:33,480 --> 07:02:35,480
We have to go through the basalt.

11607
07:02:36,060 --> 07:02:37,520
We've gone through every...

11608
07:02:37,520 --> 07:02:38,840
Oh my god.

11609
07:02:38,920 --> 07:02:40,060
I thought that was a...

11610
07:02:40,060 --> 07:02:42,160
I thought that was a fortress.

11611
07:02:42,860 --> 07:02:44,000
Oh my god.

11612
07:02:44,120 --> 07:02:46,500
I literally...

11613
07:02:46,500 --> 07:02:49,380
This I thought was the top of...

11614
07:02:49,380 --> 07:02:50,540
Oh my god.

11615
07:02:50,600 --> 07:02:52,020
I thought we had made it.

11616
07:02:55,180 --> 07:02:57,800
I made it myself so much.

11617
07:02:58,720 --> 07:03:01,550
We've gone through every biome but the basalt.

11618
07:03:02,800 --> 07:03:05,000
This is what we have to do.

11619
07:03:09,620 --> 07:03:10,180
Oh!

11620
07:03:11,000 --> 07:03:12,460
See, check that out!

11621
07:03:15,760 --> 07:03:16,500
Come here.

11622
07:03:16,960 --> 07:03:18,220
Give me magma cubes.

11623
07:03:18,940 --> 07:03:21,220
Why do they hurt so much?

11624
07:03:23,120 --> 07:03:24,600
Give me magma cubes.

11625
07:03:25,340 --> 07:03:26,360
Did that not give me anything?

11626
07:03:27,320 --> 07:03:29,840
Oh my gosh, everything is so stingy in this game.

11627
07:03:30,700 --> 07:03:32,160
No nether fortress November?

11628
07:03:32,160 --> 07:03:32,360
November?

11629
07:03:46,000 --> 07:03:46,840
Yeah, maybe.

11630
07:03:49,180 --> 07:03:51,940
If we never find one, just what do we do?

11631
07:03:55,820 --> 07:03:57,720
I think we should give ourselves a time limit.

11632
07:04:01,990 --> 07:04:04,270
And if we don't find it within the time...

11633
07:04:04,270 --> 07:04:04,350
No!

11634
07:04:24,530 --> 07:04:26,310
Don't give me...

11635
07:04:34,910 --> 07:04:36,410
Oh my god.

11636
07:04:36,750 --> 07:04:39,650
I literally was gonna say, if we don't find one in the next 30 minutes...

11637
07:04:39,650 --> 07:04:41,050
We do a new seed.

11638
07:04:41,410 --> 07:04:43,790
But then I literally just saw it.

11639
07:04:52,260 --> 07:04:53,900
Sorry, I need to drink so much more water.

11640
07:04:58,400 --> 07:04:59,700
I sent that before...

11641
07:04:59,700 --> 07:05:02,980
The funny and sad thing was that you two were making really good progress...

11642
07:05:02,980 --> 07:05:03,880
But the nether said no.

11643
07:05:06,400 --> 07:05:07,100
I sent that before.

11644
07:05:07,600 --> 07:05:08,440
That's so silly.

11645
07:05:08,560 --> 07:05:13,100
I know how to get to here, so I didn't really need to save the cords...

11646
07:05:13,100 --> 07:05:14,420
But I guess it's good to have it too.

11647
07:05:16,380 --> 07:05:17,680
Oh my god.

11648
07:05:19,100 --> 07:05:20,900
Oh my god.

11649
07:05:22,080 --> 07:05:23,500
Oh my god.

11650
07:05:24,620 --> 07:05:26,200
It was right here.

11651
07:05:26,320 --> 07:05:27,240
Oh my gosh.

11652
07:05:28,980 --> 07:05:31,040
She just has to cross from here.

11653
07:05:32,920 --> 07:05:34,100
She just crosses.

11654
07:05:34,100 --> 07:05:36,280
She's right up there, she crosses...

11655
07:05:36,280 --> 07:05:37,900
And then we just run right into it.

11656
07:05:38,120 --> 07:05:38,900
Oh my god.

11657
07:05:40,620 --> 07:05:42,400
What if I don't tell her that I found one?

11658
07:05:45,840 --> 07:05:48,180
What if I just didn't tell her that I found it?

11659
07:05:48,900 --> 07:05:49,580
I'm just kidding.

11660
07:05:50,120 --> 07:05:52,100
I mean...

11661
07:05:54,780 --> 07:05:56,160
Dragoons, I'm gonna tell her, don't worry.

11662
07:05:56,440 --> 07:05:57,560
We've been through enough.

11663
07:05:57,980 --> 07:05:59,800
We've been through enough, I'm gonna tell her, don't worry.

11664
07:05:59,800 --> 07:05:59,880
Alright.

11665
07:06:02,580 --> 07:06:04,180
Loot it and then don't tell her?

11666
07:06:05,980 --> 07:06:08,680
I'm not going in there by myself, I hate...

11667
07:06:08,680 --> 07:06:09,800
I hate fortresses.

11668
07:06:12,800 --> 07:06:15,900
I'm gonna make a little hideaway for me.

11669
07:06:18,800 --> 07:06:21,080
Don't go into the basalt, they said.

11670
07:06:22,500 --> 07:06:23,360
Oh my...

11671
07:06:23,360 --> 07:06:24,440
Doki's chat...

11672
07:06:24,440 --> 07:06:26,820
All the dragoons said don't go into the basalt.

11673
07:06:26,820 --> 07:06:29,180
You didn't have to prove me wrong that fast.

11674
07:06:29,360 --> 07:06:30,460
What did you do?

11675
07:06:30,600 --> 07:06:31,240
What did you say?

11676
07:06:33,700 --> 07:06:35,460
Thank you guys for all the donos...

11677
07:06:35,460 --> 07:06:37,160
And memberships and gifted and everything.

11678
07:06:37,940 --> 07:06:39,220
I really appreciate it.

11679
07:06:39,360 --> 07:06:40,240
Both of us.

11680
07:06:40,440 --> 07:06:43,040
Sorry we can't really acknowledge all of them on stream.

11681
07:06:45,500 --> 07:06:46,380
While we're...

11682
07:06:46,380 --> 07:06:47,500
Losing our brain cells.

11683
07:06:48,900 --> 07:06:49,960
But we are seeing.

11684
07:06:50,540 --> 07:06:52,360
As a dragoon, please don't tell her.

11685
07:06:56,820 --> 07:06:57,860
I would just snitch.

11686
07:06:58,600 --> 07:06:59,720
Yeah, you would.

11687
07:07:01,300 --> 07:07:02,700
Eragon, where are you?

11688
07:07:03,540 --> 07:07:04,800
Eragon the snitcher.

11689
07:07:04,940 --> 07:07:06,080
You gotta change your name, man.

11690
07:07:13,230 --> 07:07:14,810
So you found it, but like...

11691
07:07:14,810 --> 07:07:15,750
Doki guess?

11692
07:07:17,510 --> 07:07:19,710
This guy is really trying hard to get those.

11693
07:07:21,450 --> 07:07:22,470
I wanna get these.

11694
07:07:22,510 --> 07:07:24,770
This is perfect too, we can get lots of magma cubes.

11695
07:07:25,050 --> 07:07:27,070
Actually, I feel like this is a good...

11696
07:07:27,790 --> 07:07:30,110
Magma cubes are annoying, but they're not so...

11697
07:07:30,110 --> 07:07:30,850
Bad, you know?

11698
07:07:30,950 --> 07:07:33,090
This is a good biome for it to spawn in.

11699
07:07:34,290 --> 07:07:35,550
Why'd I say all of this?

11700
07:07:36,990 --> 07:07:37,450
And...

11701
07:07:37,450 --> 07:07:40,410
It's like a broken fortress and we don't get any blazes.

11702
07:07:42,410 --> 07:07:43,330
Oh gosh.

11703
07:07:45,530 --> 07:07:48,250
I think Doki stole one O from your name.

11704
07:07:49,370 --> 07:07:50,230
Oh, the Birdo?

11705
07:07:50,490 --> 07:07:51,110
Doki Birdo?

11706
07:07:53,670 --> 07:07:55,970
Yeah, she saw how popular Minto is.

11707
07:07:55,990 --> 07:07:57,530
And she's like, oh yeah, I'll be Doki Birdo.

11708
07:07:57,530 --> 07:07:59,530
Or she's trying to be Birdo from...

11709
07:08:01,950 --> 07:08:02,370
From...

11710
07:08:02,830 --> 07:08:05,090
Mario, but who would want to be that loser?

11711
07:08:08,990 --> 07:08:09,930
Don't jinx it?

11712
07:08:10,010 --> 07:08:10,870
I don't know, guys.

11713
07:08:11,830 --> 07:08:13,130
I'm feeling, I don't know.

11714
07:08:13,410 --> 07:08:15,750
I'm gonna hide in this cubby hole while I eat.

11715
07:08:17,190 --> 07:08:18,730
I always believed in you, especially you.

11716
07:08:20,970 --> 07:08:21,810
Thanks, Izzy.

11717
07:08:30,470 --> 07:08:32,150
Birdo is so scary looking.

11718
07:08:35,470 --> 07:08:37,790
And I like kimo kawaii things.

11719
07:08:38,610 --> 07:08:40,930
Like, seeing these things called labubus.

11720
07:08:41,030 --> 07:08:41,990
Have you guys ever heard of it?

11721
07:08:44,790 --> 07:08:46,410
You know how like...

11722
07:08:46,410 --> 07:08:48,170
These like...

11723
07:08:48,450 --> 07:08:50,270
These blind boxes of like...

11724
07:08:50,270 --> 07:08:52,930
These random characters have gotten really popular?

11725
07:08:55,010 --> 07:08:56,390
I've never seen a labubu?

11726
07:08:56,570 --> 07:08:58,210
I don't know how to spell it, but...

11727
07:08:58,210 --> 07:08:59,510
I keep just seeing people being like...

11728
07:08:59,510 --> 07:09:01,070
Who would want to buy a labubu?

11729
07:09:01,270 --> 07:09:02,310
Why are they so popular?

11730
07:09:02,430 --> 07:09:03,330
They're so ugly.

11731
07:09:03,710 --> 07:09:04,950
But they're kinda, I like them.

11732
07:09:04,970 --> 07:09:05,690
I think they're cute.

11733
07:09:05,770 --> 07:09:07,190
They look like little gremlins.

11734
07:09:09,650 --> 07:09:11,090
Labubu craze even in the west?

11735
07:09:11,170 --> 07:09:14,010
I think less so, but it's still popular.

11736
07:09:17,450 --> 07:09:19,330
People will line up at stores...

11737
07:09:19,330 --> 07:09:21,270
At like 5am for new labubus.

11738
07:09:22,930 --> 07:09:24,270
I don't understand it.

11739
07:09:25,490 --> 07:09:27,410
Got popular thanks to Lisa.

11740
07:09:29,470 --> 07:09:30,150
Like...

11741
07:09:30,930 --> 07:09:31,270
Blackpink?

11742
07:09:31,410 --> 07:09:32,470
Is she Blackpink?

11743
07:09:35,610 --> 07:09:36,750
They're cute though.

11744
07:09:36,790 --> 07:09:37,550
I like them.

11745
07:09:41,890 --> 07:09:42,570
Labubu.

11746
07:09:43,290 --> 07:09:44,190
It's fun to say.

11747
07:09:44,850 --> 07:09:45,510
Labubu.

11748
07:09:48,450 --> 07:09:49,990
Oh yeah, Lisa Blackpink.

11749
07:09:49,990 --> 07:09:50,570
Okay.

11750
07:09:52,270 --> 07:09:54,850
I don't know, recently...

11751
07:09:54,850 --> 07:09:57,470
The weirdest things are popping off.

11752
07:09:57,830 --> 07:09:58,950
Where people will like...

11753
07:09:58,950 --> 07:10:00,550
Have you guys heard about...

11754
07:10:00,550 --> 07:10:03,550
The ladies that stock TJ Maxx...

11755
07:10:03,550 --> 07:10:04,630
For Hello Kitty goods?

11756
07:10:05,050 --> 07:10:07,210
If you don't live in the US...

11757
07:10:07,210 --> 07:10:08,950
There's a store called TJ Maxx...

11758
07:10:08,950 --> 07:10:11,670
That sells kind of discounted...

11759
07:10:11,670 --> 07:10:12,910
Items and stuff.

11760
07:10:13,050 --> 07:10:14,090
It's like...

11761
07:10:15,950 --> 07:10:17,310
It's not Walmart.

11762
07:10:17,310 --> 07:10:19,350
But it's like sometimes you can find...

11763
07:10:19,350 --> 07:10:21,310
Designer brands in there that are...

11764
07:10:21,830 --> 07:10:23,150
A little...

11765
07:10:23,150 --> 07:10:24,270
Like...

11766
07:10:24,270 --> 07:10:26,330
Less expensive and stuff.

11767
07:10:27,350 --> 07:10:28,610
And so...

11768
07:10:28,610 --> 07:10:31,730
But recently, Hello Kitty blankets...

11769
07:10:31,730 --> 07:10:33,410
And like mugs and things...

11770
07:10:33,410 --> 07:10:34,710
Have become like...

11771
07:10:34,710 --> 07:10:36,170
The it item.

11772
07:10:36,370 --> 07:10:39,150
And so, these ladies...

11773
07:10:39,150 --> 07:10:41,170
Are going to TJ Maxx and like...

11774
07:10:41,170 --> 07:10:43,570
Scalping these Hello Kitty products.

11775
07:10:43,790 --> 07:10:44,890
They're not even that cute.

11776
07:10:44,890 --> 07:10:45,990
I don't understand.

11777
07:10:49,070 --> 07:10:50,790
Is it like a discount store?

11778
07:10:51,750 --> 07:10:52,230
Yeah.

11779
07:10:52,550 --> 07:10:53,890
It's like...

11780
07:10:53,890 --> 07:10:56,090
I don't know how to describe it, honestly.

11781
07:10:56,610 --> 07:10:58,810
It's like if Target was a thrift store.

11782
07:10:59,690 --> 07:11:01,050
Yeah, I guess that makes sense.

11783
07:11:03,150 --> 07:11:03,950
But they'll...

11784
07:11:03,950 --> 07:11:07,370
They'll go to TJ Maxx in the early mornings...

11785
07:11:07,370 --> 07:11:08,210
And like...

11786
07:11:08,210 --> 07:11:10,250
Fill their carts with all the...

11787
07:11:10,820 --> 07:11:12,150
Restocked Hello Kitty goods.

11788
07:11:12,150 --> 07:11:13,290
And then...

11789
07:11:16,830 --> 07:11:17,850
I'm back.

11790
07:11:18,250 --> 07:11:19,050
Welcome back.

11791
07:11:20,390 --> 07:11:22,150
So, did you get...

11792
07:11:23,210 --> 07:11:24,050
Did you...

11793
07:11:24,770 --> 07:11:26,470
Did you get any...

11794
07:11:26,470 --> 07:11:26,970
Intel?

11795
07:11:27,970 --> 07:11:29,270
On how to do this?

11796
07:11:29,550 --> 07:11:30,190
Did you cheat?

11797
07:11:30,830 --> 07:11:32,150
No, I didn't cheat.

11798
07:11:33,030 --> 07:11:34,230
No, I don't know.

11799
07:11:35,330 --> 07:11:35,990
Did you cheat?

11800
07:11:36,910 --> 07:11:37,630
No, I didn't.

11801
07:11:37,630 --> 07:11:37,670
Doki.

11802
07:11:40,350 --> 07:11:41,630
There's a guy...

11803
07:11:41,630 --> 07:11:43,690
There's a... Oh, he's getting beat up.

11804
07:11:43,830 --> 07:11:44,110
Doki?

11805
07:11:44,650 --> 07:11:47,050
I found it.

11806
07:11:47,610 --> 07:11:47,950
You.

11807
07:11:53,430 --> 07:11:54,570
I found one.

11808
07:11:59,350 --> 07:12:00,270
I built a bridge.

11809
07:12:00,350 --> 07:12:00,890
Come over here.

11810
07:12:02,690 --> 07:12:03,250
Hello?

11811
07:12:03,590 --> 07:12:04,430
Why did you leave?

11812
07:12:06,530 --> 07:12:07,010
Hello?

11813
07:12:09,370 --> 07:12:09,670
What?

11814
07:12:11,410 --> 07:12:12,170
Come here!

11815
07:12:13,210 --> 07:12:14,310
Get out of your hole.

11816
07:12:14,470 --> 07:12:15,430
I saw your hole.

11817
07:12:17,710 --> 07:12:20,070
Why is my chat...

11818
07:12:20,070 --> 07:12:21,090
Huh?

11819
07:12:21,270 --> 07:12:23,730
Why is my chat saying many different things?

11820
07:12:25,210 --> 07:12:25,630
What?

11821
07:12:26,610 --> 07:12:28,350
Because they're not watching me.

11822
07:12:28,470 --> 07:12:30,030
They didn't see me discover it.

11823
07:12:34,510 --> 07:12:35,110
What?

11824
07:12:35,670 --> 07:12:36,270
Dragoons!

11825
07:12:36,830 --> 07:12:38,370
Dragoons, why are you being like this?

11826
07:12:43,690 --> 07:12:44,090
What?

11827
07:12:44,090 --> 07:12:45,350
Dragoons said you were cheating.

11828
07:12:45,750 --> 07:12:46,130
What?

11829
07:12:46,490 --> 07:12:46,950
Oh my God.

11830
07:12:47,130 --> 07:12:52,150
No, literally, when I came back, the first super chat I saw was someone being like, give me the seed.

11831
07:12:52,370 --> 07:12:53,090
And I was like, no!

11832
07:12:54,010 --> 07:12:55,450
You don't even know the seed.

11833
07:12:55,590 --> 07:12:57,190
You can't even find the seed.

11834
07:12:58,030 --> 07:13:00,230
Yeah, I don't even have the commands, probably.

11835
07:13:00,990 --> 07:13:01,630
Oh, do you see me?

11836
07:13:01,770 --> 07:13:03,730
Yes, there's a pig in front of me!

11837
07:13:04,270 --> 07:13:05,470
Put down a mushroom!

11838
07:13:05,750 --> 07:13:06,610
I only have one!

11839
07:13:07,550 --> 07:13:09,170
That's all you need, come on!

11840
07:13:09,310 --> 07:13:10,690
But what if he hits me?

11841
07:13:11,250 --> 07:13:12,090
Put it down!

11842
07:13:12,470 --> 07:13:13,330
I have ten.

11843
07:13:15,950 --> 07:13:16,850
Put it down.

11844
07:13:17,390 --> 07:13:19,310
This is a block, it's not...

11845
07:13:19,310 --> 07:13:20,650
It's not grass!

11846
07:13:21,970 --> 07:13:23,110
What are you talking about?

11847
07:13:24,310 --> 07:13:26,910
This is another block, it's not the grass.

11848
07:13:27,710 --> 07:13:28,470
Oh, hold on.

11849
07:13:29,590 --> 07:13:30,050
Oh shit.

11850
07:13:30,170 --> 07:13:30,950
Oh, don't come for me.

11851
07:13:31,950 --> 07:13:32,810
Oh my God.

11852
07:13:33,750 --> 07:13:34,510
Use your shield.

11853
07:13:34,510 --> 07:13:39,490
They can't hit you if you have your shield up when they try to knock you back.

11854
07:13:40,130 --> 07:13:40,790
Oh, see?

11855
07:13:40,950 --> 07:13:41,470
You got him.

11856
07:13:41,590 --> 07:13:41,810
Easy.

11857
07:13:42,350 --> 07:13:42,770
Oh my God.

11858
07:13:43,090 --> 07:13:43,990
There's a gas!

11859
07:13:44,290 --> 07:13:44,890
Oh my God.

11860
07:13:45,130 --> 07:13:47,290
There's so many things going on.

11861
07:13:47,550 --> 07:13:48,210
Oh my God.

11862
07:13:48,370 --> 07:13:50,050
There's so many...

11863
07:13:54,360 --> 07:13:55,500
I'm heading over.

11864
07:13:56,440 --> 07:13:57,540
I'm heading over.

11865
07:13:57,660 --> 07:13:59,280
How did you find this fortress?

11866
07:14:00,400 --> 07:14:01,120
Because I...

11867
07:14:01,620 --> 07:14:03,740
Said, I was literally to my chat, I was like...

11868
07:14:03,740 --> 07:14:05,240
Guys, the one...

11869
07:14:05,240 --> 07:14:07,200
The one...

11870
07:14:07,200 --> 07:14:09,460
Biome we haven't been to is the basalt biome.

11871
07:14:09,520 --> 07:14:10,440
And that's where we have to go.

11872
07:14:11,460 --> 07:14:13,280
And then it was...

11873
07:14:13,860 --> 07:14:15,960
Why did everybody saying you cheated?

11874
07:14:16,660 --> 07:14:20,100
Because they're assholes, they hate me and they're trying to sabotage me.

11875
07:14:20,920 --> 07:14:21,680
Fine, you know what?

11876
07:14:21,700 --> 07:14:22,560
You can find it then.

11877
07:14:22,580 --> 07:14:23,480
No, no, no, no.

11878
07:14:23,500 --> 07:14:24,120
I believe you.

11879
07:14:24,160 --> 07:14:25,420
I'll just check the bot later.

11880
07:14:27,200 --> 07:14:27,620
What?

11881
07:14:27,620 --> 07:14:29,620
You don't believe me?

11882
07:14:29,800 --> 07:14:30,880
No, no, I believe you.

11883
07:14:30,980 --> 07:14:32,040
I believe you.

11884
07:14:32,940 --> 07:14:33,360
I...

11885
07:14:33,360 --> 07:14:35,340
I believe you.

11886
07:14:36,060 --> 07:14:37,200
What's Hot Tourist Destination?

11887
07:14:37,320 --> 07:14:39,700
Do we just go through every single biome in this stupid world?

11888
07:14:39,700 --> 07:14:40,240
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

11889
07:14:40,320 --> 07:14:42,180
We didn't go to all the biomes.

11890
07:14:46,540 --> 07:14:47,280
Okay, come here.

11891
07:14:47,700 --> 07:14:48,400
We're going.

11892
07:14:49,560 --> 07:14:50,980
How did you go so...

11893
07:14:51,600 --> 07:14:53,240
How did you go so far?

11894
07:14:53,760 --> 07:14:54,660
I only went to here.

11895
07:14:54,660 --> 07:14:55,960
Yes, where is it?

11896
07:14:55,960 --> 07:14:56,220
And there it is.

11897
07:14:56,300 --> 07:14:57,100
You see it over there?

11898
07:14:57,480 --> 07:14:57,680
No.

11899
07:14:57,680 --> 07:14:58,140
You see that?

11900
07:14:58,380 --> 07:14:58,800
No.

11901
07:14:59,100 --> 07:15:00,200
You don't see that?

11902
07:15:00,540 --> 07:15:00,820
No.

11903
07:15:00,920 --> 07:15:01,640
What do you mean you don't see that?

11904
07:15:01,640 --> 07:15:03,380
My render doesn't go that far.

11905
07:15:03,760 --> 07:15:04,460
Oh my god.

11906
07:15:06,900 --> 07:15:08,300
I need to get closer.

11907
07:15:08,820 --> 07:15:10,200
I need to get closer.

11908
07:15:10,440 --> 07:15:12,220
There's nothing there on my screen.

11909
07:15:12,600 --> 07:15:12,920
What?

11910
07:15:13,580 --> 07:15:14,580
Oh my god.

11911
07:15:14,900 --> 07:15:16,380
No wonder you wouldn't see anything then.

11912
07:15:16,860 --> 07:15:18,360
Square in the ground?

11913
07:15:18,620 --> 07:15:19,940
What's square in the ground?

11914
07:15:20,080 --> 07:15:22,740
I've never seen a fortress before, so I actually don't know what it looks like.

11915
07:15:22,740 --> 07:15:24,940
It's like just a bunch of brick.

11916
07:15:26,720 --> 07:15:27,580
That's supposed to be brick?

11917
07:15:27,580 --> 07:15:29,180
You see that big chunk of brick?

11918
07:15:29,760 --> 07:15:29,980
That?

11919
07:15:30,560 --> 07:15:31,160
Yeah.

11920
07:15:32,100 --> 07:15:32,440
Oh shit.

11921
07:15:32,440 --> 07:15:33,500
Oh, that!

11922
07:15:34,660 --> 07:15:35,020
Yeah!

11923
07:15:35,640 --> 07:15:37,080
Wait, that's a fortress?

11924
07:15:37,360 --> 07:15:39,320
It's just brick!

11925
07:15:39,780 --> 07:15:41,080
That's what I said!

11926
07:15:41,240 --> 07:15:43,220
It's just in front of us!

11927
07:15:43,560 --> 07:15:44,340
I know!

11928
07:15:45,640 --> 07:15:47,900
That's what it was supposed to look like?

11929
07:15:48,320 --> 07:15:49,720
Yes, what did you expect?

11930
07:15:49,720 --> 07:15:51,880
I thought it'd be like a fortress!

11931
07:15:52,780 --> 07:15:54,320
No, they're really lame!

11932
07:15:54,700 --> 07:15:59,840
Oh, maybe we, like, pass by a lot of these, because they are...

11933
07:15:59,840 --> 07:16:01,320
No, I don't think so.

11934
07:16:01,940 --> 07:16:06,220
They do not look very easy to see.

11935
07:16:08,060 --> 07:16:12,240
Oh, apparently it's very rare for it to spawn like that.

11936
07:16:13,440 --> 07:16:15,340
Oh, well, we're in it.

11937
07:16:15,480 --> 07:16:16,100
We're in it.

11938
07:16:16,180 --> 07:16:16,680
Alright, it's time.

11939
07:16:16,680 --> 07:16:17,300
Oh my God!

11940
07:16:17,720 --> 07:16:19,360
There's the blazes, there's the blazes!

11941
07:16:24,060 --> 07:16:26,220
Alright, time to take down.

11942
07:16:26,320 --> 07:16:26,720
Are you ready?

11943
07:16:27,580 --> 07:16:30,860
Oh gosh, we might actually fall in there.

11944
07:16:33,000 --> 07:16:35,160
This is it, this is what we've been working for!

11945
07:16:35,380 --> 07:16:37,320
We worked so hard for this.

11946
07:16:37,620 --> 07:16:39,080
For this, we have to live.

11947
07:16:39,960 --> 07:16:41,520
Okay, yeah, see?

11948
07:16:41,700 --> 07:16:43,100
That's what I was afraid would happen.

11949
07:16:44,020 --> 07:16:44,940
Hey, move, move!

11950
07:16:49,140 --> 07:16:53,340
We can maybe build a staircase like this.

11951
07:16:54,700 --> 07:16:55,840
Oh my God, we did it.

11952
07:16:56,560 --> 07:16:58,440
We actually did it.

11953
07:16:58,740 --> 07:16:59,660
Yeah, I know I did it.

11954
07:17:00,000 --> 07:17:01,160
We did it.

11955
07:17:01,820 --> 07:17:02,760
I fell down.

11956
07:17:03,160 --> 07:17:04,300
Okay, that's fine.

11957
07:17:04,760 --> 07:17:06,400
We do need a way out though.

11958
07:17:09,260 --> 07:17:16,740
Okay, is that enough?

11959
07:17:16,740 --> 07:17:19,040
No, that's not good.

11960
07:17:20,800 --> 07:17:21,680
What happened?

11961
07:17:21,960 --> 07:17:23,220
Wait, I don't like the sound of that.

11962
07:17:23,440 --> 07:17:24,760
Why did you say that?

11963
07:17:25,360 --> 07:17:27,280
No, I'm just trying to figure out a way out.

11964
07:17:28,320 --> 07:17:29,380
But it was like lava.

11965
07:17:30,920 --> 07:17:32,740
I'm just gonna...

11966
07:17:33,980 --> 07:17:35,340
Do you hear the blazes?

11967
07:17:35,860 --> 07:17:36,300
No.

11968
07:17:36,900 --> 07:17:38,320
Try to get them up close.

11969
07:17:38,480 --> 07:17:40,140
Don't get them from far away.

11970
07:17:40,500 --> 07:17:41,880
What if there's sickles?

11971
07:17:42,900 --> 07:17:44,580
Put down torches, put down torches.

11972
07:17:44,580 --> 07:17:47,820
What does the torches do?

11973
07:17:48,640 --> 07:17:50,560
They stop the wither skellies from spawning.

11974
07:17:51,060 --> 07:17:52,420
No, I'm not talking about that.

11975
07:17:52,520 --> 07:17:54,940
I'm just talking about what if I just encounter one.

11976
07:17:55,240 --> 07:17:56,340
Then don't fight it.

11977
07:17:56,460 --> 07:17:57,200
Don't fight it.

11978
07:17:57,740 --> 07:18:00,580
Because if it hits you, it'll like...

11979
07:18:01,320 --> 07:18:02,300
Oh my God, it's burning.

11980
07:18:02,680 --> 07:18:04,100
Oh, I see one.

11981
07:18:04,620 --> 07:18:05,580
He's right there.

11982
07:18:05,780 --> 07:18:07,120
Oh no, the wither skelly!

11983
07:18:07,300 --> 07:18:07,760
Oh shoot.

11984
07:18:09,780 --> 07:18:10,860
You can't get me.

11985
07:18:11,420 --> 07:18:13,020
It's a good spot.

11986
07:18:14,320 --> 07:18:14,680
Nice.

11987
07:18:15,160 --> 07:18:16,460
Wait, what's that in front of us?

11988
07:18:17,140 --> 07:18:18,300
That's just basalt.

11989
07:18:18,880 --> 07:18:20,340
What are they doing here like this?

11990
07:18:20,580 --> 07:18:21,980
Oh my God, there's a bunch of wither skellies.

11991
07:18:22,340 --> 07:18:23,240
Yeah, I see them.

11992
07:18:24,620 --> 07:18:25,580
We don't want them.

11993
07:18:26,620 --> 07:18:27,380
Not this time.

11994
07:18:27,660 --> 07:18:28,480
That's not our goal.

11995
07:18:29,660 --> 07:18:31,560
Wither skellies, you are not our goal this time.

11996
07:18:32,060 --> 07:18:33,160
Like, don't let them touch you.

11997
07:18:33,320 --> 07:18:34,360
Oh wait, we got the warts!

11998
07:18:35,960 --> 07:18:36,940
Oh yes, these!

11999
07:18:37,080 --> 07:18:37,720
We need these!

12000
07:18:38,200 --> 07:18:40,420
Some of them are not grown though.

12001
07:18:40,500 --> 07:18:41,060
Oh, maybe they are.

12002
07:18:42,480 --> 07:18:44,460
But I think the blazes are here.

12003
07:18:45,720 --> 07:18:46,920
No, that's a wither skelly.

12004
07:18:47,660 --> 07:18:48,060
Oh, where?

12005
07:18:49,060 --> 07:18:49,540
Over there.

12006
07:18:49,600 --> 07:18:51,180
No, I think I hear blazes to my left.

12007
07:18:52,100 --> 07:18:53,640
There's also a wither right here.

12008
07:18:54,040 --> 07:18:55,060
I'm making more...

12009
07:18:57,000 --> 07:18:57,900
Okay, I see them.

12010
07:18:58,040 --> 07:18:58,780
I'm making more torches.

12011
07:19:00,820 --> 07:19:01,400
Yeah, bitch.

12012
07:19:03,460 --> 07:19:03,980
Yeah, they're right here.

12013
07:19:04,000 --> 07:19:04,500
They're right here.

12014
07:19:04,720 --> 07:19:05,400
In front of me.

12015
07:19:05,820 --> 07:19:06,100
Okay.

12016
07:19:06,100 --> 07:19:06,180
Okay.

12017
07:19:09,140 --> 07:19:10,120
They're not our goal.

12018
07:19:10,320 --> 07:19:11,200
They're not our goal.

12019
07:19:12,220 --> 07:19:13,100
Like the... Oh!

12020
07:19:13,680 --> 07:19:14,040
Diamond!

12021
07:19:14,720 --> 07:19:15,380
Let's go!

12022
07:19:16,200 --> 07:19:17,300
Oh, I think I...

12023
07:19:18,480 --> 07:19:18,840
What?

12024
07:19:19,360 --> 07:19:19,560
What?

12025
07:19:19,700 --> 07:19:19,700
What?

12026
07:19:19,800 --> 07:19:19,800
What?

12027
07:19:20,060 --> 07:19:21,860
It was just a normal skelly, but I ran.

12028
07:19:21,940 --> 07:19:22,360
Oh my god, okay.

12029
07:19:23,080 --> 07:19:24,220
Okay, I thought it was...

12030
07:19:24,220 --> 07:19:24,980
He freaked me out.

12031
07:19:25,060 --> 07:19:25,240
He freaked me out.

12032
07:19:25,240 --> 07:19:26,400
No, he freaked me out too.

12033
07:19:26,820 --> 07:19:27,500
Oh my god.

12034
07:19:27,560 --> 07:19:28,700
I got freaked out a little.

12035
07:19:29,520 --> 07:19:30,740
Alright, no, but the blazes are right here.

12036
07:19:30,760 --> 07:19:31,260
I hear them.

12037
07:19:31,540 --> 07:19:32,060
Yeah, I do.

12038
07:19:32,180 --> 07:19:32,620
They're everywhere.

12039
07:19:32,980 --> 07:19:33,160
Okay.

12040
07:19:33,780 --> 07:19:35,100
Oh god, they're breathing.

12041
07:19:35,100 --> 07:19:37,120
Oh, why do they sound so scary?

12042
07:19:39,740 --> 07:19:41,280
Breathing really hard.

12043
07:19:41,740 --> 07:19:43,260
I think they're upstairs.

12044
07:19:43,480 --> 07:19:43,860
Are they upstairs?

12045
07:19:44,860 --> 07:19:45,240
Maybe.

12046
07:19:46,840 --> 07:19:48,180
I hear a wither skelly.

12047
07:19:49,480 --> 07:19:50,200
Maybe they are.

12048
07:19:50,300 --> 07:19:50,960
Oh, no, no, no, no!

12049
07:19:51,220 --> 07:19:51,600
Oh shit!

12050
07:19:51,720 --> 07:19:51,980
Oh shit!

12051
07:19:53,080 --> 07:19:54,020
You can block them.

12052
07:19:54,440 --> 07:19:55,100
You can block...

12053
07:19:56,520 --> 07:19:56,960
Okay.

12054
07:19:59,060 --> 07:20:01,360
I have a lot of experience with these guys.

12055
07:20:02,000 --> 07:20:02,880
Oh my god, you're gaming?

12056
07:20:02,980 --> 07:20:03,400
You're gaming?

12057
07:20:03,920 --> 07:20:05,240
I got nothing though.

12058
07:20:06,160 --> 07:20:06,560
No!

12059
07:20:07,740 --> 07:20:08,160
Next up!

12060
07:20:10,180 --> 07:20:11,240
Oh, nothing here, nothing.

12061
07:20:11,440 --> 07:20:12,240
Dead end, dead end, dead end.

12062
07:20:12,320 --> 07:20:12,560
Okay.

12063
07:20:12,820 --> 07:20:13,340
Dead end.

12064
07:20:15,000 --> 07:20:15,720
Dead end.

12065
07:20:16,160 --> 07:20:16,360
Yeah.

12066
07:20:16,400 --> 07:20:16,720
Are you sure?

12067
07:20:16,880 --> 07:20:17,820
Yeah, you go for it.

12068
07:20:18,480 --> 07:20:19,520
Oh, didn't trust me.

12069
07:20:19,580 --> 07:20:20,100
That's cool.

12070
07:20:20,240 --> 07:20:20,800
That's fine.

12071
07:20:20,980 --> 07:20:21,520
That's fine.

12072
07:20:21,620 --> 07:20:21,640
Yeah.

12073
07:20:22,120 --> 07:20:22,820
That's okay.

12074
07:20:22,960 --> 07:20:23,380
That's okay.

12075
07:20:23,380 --> 07:20:23,640
I was just double checking.

12076
07:20:23,640 --> 07:20:24,840
That's okay if you don't trust me.

12077
07:20:24,940 --> 07:20:25,360
That's okay.

12078
07:20:25,460 --> 07:20:25,960
That's okay.

12079
07:20:26,320 --> 07:20:26,860
It's fine.

12080
07:20:27,420 --> 07:20:28,060
It's fine.

12081
07:20:28,160 --> 07:20:29,400
Some people just don't trust others.

12082
07:20:30,840 --> 07:20:31,720
Where did you go?

12083
07:20:31,720 --> 07:20:33,820
I'm trying to see where they are.

12084
07:20:34,300 --> 07:20:35,960
I think they're all above us.

12085
07:20:37,220 --> 07:20:38,780
Yeah, how do we get above?

12086
07:20:41,720 --> 07:20:43,260
Oh, we probably have to dig up.

12087
07:20:44,120 --> 07:20:44,560
Okay.

12088
07:20:45,180 --> 07:20:46,780
But we got, we found this!

12089
07:20:46,880 --> 07:20:47,800
Oh my gosh.

12090
07:20:47,900 --> 07:20:49,740
Oh my gosh, you guys.

12091
07:20:49,980 --> 07:20:50,540
Oh my god.

12092
07:20:50,620 --> 07:20:52,120
This is where the real grind comes.

12093
07:20:52,640 --> 07:20:54,720
We don't even have enough for like...

12094
07:20:56,740 --> 07:20:57,220
Like...

12095
07:20:57,220 --> 07:20:57,920
Wait, do we go here?

12096
07:20:59,640 --> 07:21:00,120
Where?

12097
07:21:01,920 --> 07:21:02,300
Here.

12098
07:21:03,120 --> 07:21:04,180
I don't see you.

12099
07:21:05,440 --> 07:21:06,700
The other exit.

12100
07:21:06,920 --> 07:21:07,620
Below the stairs.

12101
07:21:07,780 --> 07:21:08,160
Here, here, here.

12102
07:21:08,380 --> 07:21:09,300
We didn't go this way.

12103
07:21:09,420 --> 07:21:09,500
Oh, oh, oh.

12104
07:21:09,700 --> 07:21:10,700
No, we didn't go this way.

12105
07:21:10,800 --> 07:21:11,100
Yeah.

12106
07:21:11,340 --> 07:21:12,700
Hold on, I'm grabbing the rest of the warts.

12107
07:21:13,820 --> 07:21:15,480
Did I grab some warts accidentally?

12108
07:21:15,660 --> 07:21:16,180
Oh, I did here.

12109
07:21:16,260 --> 07:21:17,240
Here's some nether warts too.

12110
07:21:17,400 --> 07:21:17,960
Okay, thank you.

12111
07:21:18,420 --> 07:21:19,440
Oh, we didn't go here.

12112
07:21:20,580 --> 07:21:21,740
Oh, this is scary.

12113
07:21:21,880 --> 07:21:23,320
Okay, we didn't go here.

12114
07:21:24,300 --> 07:21:25,380
I hear a magma.

12115
07:21:26,100 --> 07:21:27,060
It's above us.

12116
07:21:27,260 --> 07:21:27,580
I hear Wither Skelly.

12117
07:21:27,680 --> 07:21:28,400
I hear Wither Skelly.

12118
07:21:30,440 --> 07:21:31,320
Be careful.

12119
07:21:31,520 --> 07:21:32,680
Oh, there's more blazes here.

12120
07:21:32,760 --> 07:21:33,600
There's more blazes here.

12121
07:21:34,540 --> 07:21:35,000
Okay.

12122
07:21:38,850 --> 07:21:39,510
Watch me.

12123
07:21:39,590 --> 07:21:40,410
I'll get the blaze.

12124
07:21:40,790 --> 07:21:42,090
You get the Wither Skelly.

12125
07:21:42,670 --> 07:21:43,570
Where is the Wither Skelly?

12126
07:21:44,070 --> 07:21:44,710
I don't see him.

12127
07:21:44,890 --> 07:21:45,090
I heard him.

12128
07:21:45,990 --> 07:21:46,890
I got obsidian too.

12129
07:21:47,210 --> 07:21:48,930
I got rip armor trim.

12130
07:21:49,090 --> 07:21:49,730
Do we want that?

12131
07:21:49,850 --> 07:21:50,030
Oh.

12132
07:21:50,510 --> 07:21:51,350
No, we don't need it.

12133
07:21:52,510 --> 07:21:53,730
Is that netherite?

12134
07:21:54,750 --> 07:21:56,450
Are armor trims netherite?

12135
07:21:57,050 --> 07:21:57,510
No.

12136
07:21:57,790 --> 07:21:58,910
Come here, come here.

12137
07:22:00,870 --> 07:22:02,390
There's more wards here too.

12138
07:22:03,350 --> 07:22:03,870
Got him.

12139
07:22:06,700 --> 07:22:08,380
I don't see...

12140
07:22:09,740 --> 07:22:10,860
Okay, run, run, run, run.

12141
07:22:11,560 --> 07:22:12,320
What happened?

12142
07:22:12,440 --> 07:22:12,800
What happened?

12143
07:22:13,280 --> 07:22:13,860
I got hit.

12144
07:22:14,020 --> 07:22:14,540
I got hit.

12145
07:22:14,760 --> 07:22:14,980
I got hit.

12146
07:22:14,980 --> 07:22:15,280
Where are they?

12147
07:22:15,980 --> 07:22:16,680
They're on the side.

12148
07:22:16,740 --> 07:22:17,360
They're on the side.

12149
07:22:17,820 --> 07:22:18,440
They're to the right.

12150
07:22:18,540 --> 07:22:18,920
To the right.

12151
07:22:19,400 --> 07:22:20,300
Oh, there they are.

12152
07:22:20,360 --> 07:22:20,600
Alright.

12153
07:22:20,860 --> 07:22:21,140
JK.

12154
07:22:21,340 --> 07:22:21,840
Oh my God.

12155
07:22:22,060 --> 07:22:22,400
JK.

12156
07:22:23,820 --> 07:22:26,620
I don't see the other skeleton.

12157
07:22:28,020 --> 07:22:28,580
That's okay.

12158
07:22:30,140 --> 07:22:31,100
Oh, he might be up.

12159
07:22:31,100 --> 07:22:32,560
I see magma cube.

12160
07:22:33,940 --> 07:22:35,540
Oh my God, this...

12161
07:22:36,100 --> 07:22:37,560
This is so confusing.

12162
07:22:40,840 --> 07:22:42,480
I told you, never give up.

12163
07:22:43,280 --> 07:22:44,460
Never give up.

12164
07:22:45,200 --> 07:22:46,660
Someone almost gave up.

12165
07:22:48,140 --> 07:22:49,660
Someone almost gave up.

12166
07:22:49,880 --> 07:22:50,760
I found it.

12167
07:22:50,940 --> 07:22:52,260
Someone almost gave up.

12168
07:22:52,600 --> 07:22:55,520
Before they found it, before they found it, they almost gave up.

12169
07:22:58,520 --> 07:22:59,560
I remembered.

12170
07:22:59,560 --> 07:23:01,400
We're like locked in now.

12171
07:23:01,520 --> 07:23:02,080
We're like...

12172
07:23:02,080 --> 07:23:03,400
We're so...

12173
07:23:03,400 --> 07:23:04,300
We can't.

12174
07:23:04,400 --> 07:23:04,880
We can't.

12175
07:23:05,160 --> 07:23:06,160
Oh, there's a magma cube here.

12176
07:23:07,700 --> 07:23:08,520
Kill him.

12177
07:23:09,360 --> 07:23:10,080
Oh, I see him.

12178
07:23:10,940 --> 07:23:14,560
I think this is not a bad spawn though, because honestly...

12179
07:23:17,120 --> 07:23:17,640
Like...

12180
07:23:17,640 --> 07:23:17,900
Okay.

12181
07:23:20,040 --> 07:23:22,460
I don't have any more torches, by the way.

12182
07:23:23,060 --> 07:23:23,440
Okay.

12183
07:23:24,120 --> 07:23:27,120
Oh, there's another blaze.

12184
07:23:29,560 --> 07:23:30,180
Oh my God.

12185
07:23:30,440 --> 07:23:34,570
I don't know where he was.

12186
07:23:34,710 --> 07:23:35,750
I don't know anything.

12187
07:23:35,750 --> 07:23:36,170
Shoot me.

12188
07:23:36,770 --> 07:23:37,510
Shoot me.

12189
07:23:38,510 --> 07:23:39,410
Oh my God.

12190
07:23:41,470 --> 07:23:42,970
I got blaze rod.

12191
07:23:44,190 --> 07:23:45,490
Get a blaze rod.

12192
07:23:45,970 --> 07:23:47,210
Okay, I got blaze rod.

12193
07:23:47,250 --> 07:23:48,490
How many blaze rods do we need?

12194
07:23:48,690 --> 07:23:49,350
I don't know.

12195
07:23:52,770 --> 07:23:54,490
That's a dead end.

12196
07:23:54,850 --> 07:23:56,490
That's a dead end right there.

12197
07:23:57,110 --> 07:23:58,950
Did you get the warts?

12198
07:24:00,130 --> 07:24:01,030
Yeah, I got them.

12199
07:24:01,030 --> 07:24:02,110
Alright, we gotta go up.

12200
07:24:02,130 --> 07:24:03,590
Oh, is this one of those that drops off?

12201
07:24:03,690 --> 07:24:05,390
Yeah, that's what I was like.

12202
07:24:07,370 --> 07:24:08,470
We can do that.

12203
07:24:08,570 --> 07:24:08,810
There we go.

12204
07:24:08,830 --> 07:24:10,470
Oh, there's another wither skillie.

12205
07:24:10,870 --> 07:24:11,990
Oh, he dropped off.

12206
07:24:13,510 --> 07:24:17,190
Oh yeah, the rib armor trim would be so cool again if only we did it.

12207
07:24:17,890 --> 07:24:20,030
There's so many rib armor trim.

12208
07:24:21,170 --> 07:24:21,550
Yeah.

12209
07:24:24,570 --> 07:24:27,250
Ten rods is... Okay, we need at least ten rods.

12210
07:24:27,490 --> 07:24:28,850
We gotta get the spawner then.

12211
07:24:30,010 --> 07:24:31,350
Wait, do you have any more torches?

12212
07:24:32,190 --> 07:24:32,990
Yeah, I have some.

12213
07:24:33,430 --> 07:24:33,890
Where are you?

12214
07:24:35,550 --> 07:24:36,070
Upstairs?

12215
07:24:36,950 --> 07:24:37,490
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

12216
07:24:37,490 --> 07:24:37,930
I'm here.

12217
07:24:38,890 --> 07:24:41,110
I guess I'll throw away the bone.

12218
07:24:42,250 --> 07:24:43,290
I guess.

12219
07:24:43,470 --> 07:24:44,870
You're a single bone?

12220
07:24:45,110 --> 07:24:47,330
No, I have six bones.

12221
07:24:47,470 --> 07:24:50,010
I guess I'll get rid of it.

12222
07:24:50,130 --> 07:24:51,390
Oh, there's diamond horse armor.

12223
07:24:54,330 --> 07:24:56,070
I wish they would come closer.

12224
07:24:57,130 --> 07:24:58,030
I have arrows.

12225
07:24:58,890 --> 07:25:01,590
Now we can't get the blaze riser all the way over there.

12226
07:25:02,330 --> 07:25:03,110
This is scary.

12227
07:25:03,110 --> 07:25:04,130
I think that's where the... See?

12228
07:25:04,370 --> 07:25:06,190
Okay, do you... Oh, you're...

12229
07:25:06,190 --> 07:25:07,370
You're what's it called?

12230
07:25:09,490 --> 07:25:12,450
You see... Can you see where it looks like a jungle gym?

12231
07:25:12,970 --> 07:25:13,350
Yeah.

12232
07:25:13,870 --> 07:25:15,290
That's where the spawner is.

12233
07:25:15,650 --> 07:25:16,490
How do we get there?

12234
07:25:16,550 --> 07:25:18,210
Maybe it's like over here to our left?

12235
07:25:19,150 --> 07:25:21,770
Maybe, but it'll be really risky running over there.

12236
07:25:21,890 --> 07:25:23,010
Oh, there should be a guy here.

12237
07:25:23,330 --> 07:25:24,210
Oh, there is!

12238
07:25:25,110 --> 07:25:25,710
It is Ash!

12239
07:25:26,850 --> 07:25:27,670
Oh, shit!

12240
07:25:27,890 --> 07:25:28,510
Why did I get hit?

12241
07:25:28,510 --> 07:25:29,090
How did he hit you?

12242
07:25:33,030 --> 07:25:34,290
Did you kill him?

12243
07:25:34,570 --> 07:25:35,570
I killed one of them.

12244
07:25:35,990 --> 07:25:36,350
Okay.

12245
07:25:37,330 --> 07:25:38,290
Ignore that guy.

12246
07:25:38,490 --> 07:25:39,150
Ignore that guy.

12247
07:25:39,350 --> 07:25:41,350
It has to be this way then.

12248
07:25:42,790 --> 07:25:44,190
If we can even get to it.

12249
07:25:44,390 --> 07:25:45,410
Actually, maybe we can.

12250
07:25:45,830 --> 07:25:46,170
Oh, hello.

12251
07:25:46,670 --> 07:25:47,590
I looted that, I think.

12252
07:25:49,110 --> 07:25:50,590
No, not this way.

12253
07:25:50,590 --> 07:25:51,010
But...

12254
07:25:53,810 --> 07:25:57,590
The hardest part is avoiding them when they're...

12255
07:25:58,270 --> 07:25:58,870
Oh, come here.

12256
07:25:59,730 --> 07:26:01,530
Because they like to fly away.

12257
07:26:02,950 --> 07:26:04,210
He's not above.

12258
07:26:04,450 --> 07:26:05,390
How did we get there?

12259
07:26:05,450 --> 07:26:07,610
I feel like we already went through all the entrances.

12260
07:26:08,130 --> 07:26:09,410
Sometimes it's not connected.

12261
07:26:09,730 --> 07:26:11,430
Sometimes it's like blocked off, you know?

12262
07:26:12,930 --> 07:26:13,430
Okay, watch out for him.

12263
07:26:13,430 --> 07:26:13,950
Watch out for him.

12264
07:26:16,110 --> 07:26:17,710
Wait, do we go drop down from here?

12265
07:26:17,850 --> 07:26:18,990
Wait, maybe?

12266
07:26:19,050 --> 07:26:19,390
Oh, maybe.

12267
07:26:20,710 --> 07:26:22,050
It's like here, right?

12268
07:26:22,930 --> 07:26:24,210
Well, you went down here though.

12269
07:26:25,490 --> 07:26:26,570
Oh my God, I hear one.

12270
07:26:28,030 --> 07:26:29,530
He's breathing in my ear.

12271
07:26:30,290 --> 07:26:32,670
It's like around this general area.

12272
07:26:34,230 --> 07:26:34,630
Right?

12273
07:26:34,910 --> 07:26:35,950
No, it's not connected.

12274
07:26:36,350 --> 07:26:37,110
I don't think it's connected.

12275
07:26:37,250 --> 07:26:38,810
Unless... Oh wait, it's probably down this way.

12276
07:26:39,090 --> 07:26:40,090
Oh shit!

12277
07:26:40,470 --> 07:26:41,030
Oh no, Doki!

12278
07:26:41,270 --> 07:26:41,610
Doki!

12279
07:26:42,250 --> 07:26:42,650
Doki!

12280
07:26:42,770 --> 07:26:43,130
Doki!

12281
07:26:43,250 --> 07:26:44,090
I'm not okay!

12282
07:26:44,190 --> 07:26:44,950
Okay, I'm coming over!

12283
07:26:45,110 --> 07:26:45,930
I'm coming over!

12284
07:26:46,070 --> 07:26:46,770
I'm not okay!

12285
07:26:46,870 --> 07:26:47,330
I'm not okay!

12286
07:26:47,610 --> 07:26:48,030
Where are you?

12287
07:26:48,250 --> 07:26:48,450
Where are you?

12288
07:26:48,690 --> 07:26:48,890
Where are you?

12289
07:26:49,230 --> 07:26:50,090
I'm not okay!

12290
07:26:50,090 --> 07:26:51,370
You give me baby!

12291
07:26:53,090 --> 07:26:54,030
There's another one!

12292
07:26:54,410 --> 07:26:55,090
There's another one!

12293
07:26:55,550 --> 07:26:56,750
Okay, I got one of them.

12294
07:26:56,930 --> 07:26:57,510
I got one of them.

12295
07:26:57,590 --> 07:26:58,030
Are you okay?

12296
07:26:58,270 --> 07:26:58,970
Are you okay?

12297
07:26:59,250 --> 07:26:59,770
Are you please?

12298
07:26:59,890 --> 07:27:00,450
There's a blaze!

12299
07:27:00,510 --> 07:27:00,890
There's a blaze!

12300
07:27:00,910 --> 07:27:02,190
Please, please, please.

12301
07:27:02,730 --> 07:27:03,250
Yeah, I'm okay.

12302
07:27:03,350 --> 07:27:03,590
I'm okay.

12303
07:27:03,630 --> 07:27:05,050
I just heard dad howling.

12304
07:27:05,150 --> 07:27:05,850
I freaked out.

12305
07:27:06,030 --> 07:27:07,670
I heard you was howling and I was like...

12306
07:27:07,670 --> 07:27:08,070
Oh shit!

12307
07:27:08,190 --> 07:27:08,630
Oh shit!

12308
07:27:08,730 --> 07:27:08,850
Shit!

12309
07:27:09,010 --> 07:27:09,010
Shit!

12310
07:27:09,090 --> 07:27:09,150
Shit!

12311
07:27:09,650 --> 07:27:10,830
I might not be okay.

12312
07:27:11,210 --> 07:27:11,470
Hold on.

12313
07:27:11,730 --> 07:27:12,390
Get behind my shield!

12314
07:27:12,430 --> 07:27:13,370
Get behind my shield!

12315
07:27:13,570 --> 07:27:14,590
Get behind my shield!

12316
07:27:15,230 --> 07:27:15,970
A tactical retreat!

12317
07:27:16,310 --> 07:27:16,510
Okay.

12318
07:27:17,310 --> 07:27:17,910
Oh my God.

12319
07:27:19,830 --> 07:27:20,330
Got him.

12320
07:27:20,750 --> 07:27:21,410
Oh, there's more!

12321
07:27:21,810 --> 07:27:21,930
There's more!

12322
07:27:21,990 --> 07:27:22,030
There's more!

12323
07:27:22,030 --> 07:27:23,470
Yeah, there were two of them!

12324
07:27:23,530 --> 07:27:24,050
There were two of them!

12325
07:27:24,910 --> 07:27:25,270
Okay.

12326
07:27:25,750 --> 07:27:26,410
You got it.

12327
07:27:26,430 --> 07:27:26,870
You got it.

12328
07:27:26,950 --> 07:27:27,770
Oh my God.

12329
07:27:28,050 --> 07:27:28,910
Okay, we're okay.

12330
07:27:29,110 --> 07:27:29,750
We're okay.

12331
07:27:30,070 --> 07:27:30,730
We're okay.

12332
07:27:31,730 --> 07:27:32,450
We're okay.

12333
07:27:33,990 --> 07:27:34,710
We're okay!

12334
07:27:34,710 --> 07:27:35,030
We're okay!

12335
07:27:35,030 --> 07:27:35,470
We're okay.

12336
07:27:35,670 --> 07:27:36,390
Oh my God.

12337
07:27:36,430 --> 07:27:38,870
It freaked me out because my dog was also howling.

12338
07:27:38,970 --> 07:27:39,810
He was... I don't know.

12339
07:27:39,890 --> 07:27:41,530
I think he heard us yelling and he's like...

12340
07:27:41,530 --> 07:27:42,270
I wanna get in.

12341
07:27:42,270 --> 07:27:43,690
He was like...

12342
07:27:43,690 --> 07:27:47,670
He was like...

12343
07:27:47,670 --> 07:27:49,650
I was like freaking out.

12344
07:27:49,710 --> 07:27:51,150
I was like, why is he howling?

12345
07:27:53,850 --> 07:27:55,050
Everything was happening.

12346
07:27:57,590 --> 07:27:58,550
Oh, there's magmas.

12347
07:28:06,430 --> 07:28:09,670
Oh my God.

12348
07:28:10,250 --> 07:28:11,450
I think that was a good idea.

12349
07:28:12,590 --> 07:28:14,550
Why did they come at me like that?

12350
07:28:14,590 --> 07:28:15,050
Oh my God.

12351
07:28:15,050 --> 07:28:16,270
It's because you're literally killing them.

12352
07:28:16,330 --> 07:28:16,950
What do you mean?

12353
07:28:18,490 --> 07:28:18,910
No.

12354
07:28:19,590 --> 07:28:20,850
No, I would never.

12355
07:28:21,330 --> 07:28:21,750
No.

12356
07:28:22,430 --> 07:28:23,490
What can I get rid of?

12357
07:28:26,010 --> 07:28:26,530
What?

12358
07:28:27,350 --> 07:28:27,870
What?

12359
07:28:28,610 --> 07:28:29,150
Oh my God.

12360
07:28:29,870 --> 07:28:30,350
Yeah.

12361
07:28:31,050 --> 07:28:31,570
Yeah.

12362
07:28:31,930 --> 07:28:32,610
You got him.

12363
07:28:35,610 --> 07:28:37,550
I hate wither skellies.

12364
07:28:38,330 --> 07:28:40,410
Oh, there's a place.

12365
07:28:41,070 --> 07:28:42,330
Yeah, the spawn.

12366
07:28:42,510 --> 07:28:43,930
Wait, which one was the spawner again?

12367
07:28:43,930 --> 07:28:45,530
I already lost... I only got one bracelet.

12368
07:28:46,190 --> 07:28:47,430
I know where it was.

12369
07:28:47,570 --> 07:28:48,610
I don't wanna get rid of the string.

12370
07:28:48,710 --> 07:28:49,750
What if I need to make a new bow?

12371
07:28:50,210 --> 07:28:51,370
Well, I guess I don't need the bow.

12372
07:28:51,890 --> 07:28:52,650
Oh, the quartz.

12373
07:28:52,770 --> 07:28:53,030
Thank you.

12374
07:28:53,090 --> 07:28:53,730
I don't need the quartz.

12375
07:28:54,830 --> 07:28:56,790
Oh, I need to get rid of...

12376
07:28:56,790 --> 07:28:57,290
There we go.

12377
07:28:57,350 --> 07:28:57,550
Okay.

12378
07:28:58,670 --> 07:29:00,230
I need to keep my gold chest plate.

12379
07:29:00,310 --> 07:29:02,050
What if my gold helmet breaks, guys?

12380
07:29:03,210 --> 07:29:03,610
Watch out.

12381
07:29:03,650 --> 07:29:03,850
Watch out.

12382
07:29:03,890 --> 07:29:04,070
Watch out.

12383
07:29:04,130 --> 07:29:04,790
I think I heard a guy.

12384
07:29:05,890 --> 07:29:06,170
Nevermind.

12385
07:29:06,490 --> 07:29:07,910
I think it's just the magma cubes.

12386
07:29:08,010 --> 07:29:08,790
Wait, so where was it?

12387
07:29:09,230 --> 07:29:09,930
Okay, this way?

12388
07:29:10,570 --> 07:29:13,130
But it's gonna be really dangerous going over there, I think.

12389
07:29:13,130 --> 07:29:14,630
I think we gotta take the sip.

12390
07:29:14,770 --> 07:29:16,090
I think we gotta take...

12391
07:29:16,090 --> 07:29:16,810
I don't know.

12392
07:29:16,950 --> 07:29:19,310
I think it's safer to just let them spawn...

12393
07:29:19,310 --> 07:29:21,390
Where... When we... Okay, there's a... Yeah.

12394
07:29:22,150 --> 07:29:23,450
I don't know why he's howling.

12395
07:29:23,890 --> 07:29:26,150
I don't know why he's howling right now.

12396
07:29:26,530 --> 07:29:27,050
Is your dog howling?

12397
07:29:27,090 --> 07:29:28,530
Yeah, my dog's howling.

12398
07:29:28,990 --> 07:29:30,430
Yeah, see, we have to, like, go down here.

12399
07:29:30,430 --> 07:29:31,410
He never howls.

12400
07:29:32,070 --> 07:29:34,130
I think it's just safer to...

12401
07:29:36,550 --> 07:29:36,950
To...

12402
07:29:36,950 --> 07:29:40,190
You can block the skellies in the hallways because they're three blocks tall.

12403
07:29:40,590 --> 07:29:41,630
Oh, really?

12404
07:29:45,190 --> 07:29:46,150
Okay, good to know.

12405
07:29:48,230 --> 07:29:48,990
I don't know.

12406
07:29:49,790 --> 07:29:50,970
I just wanna eat my dinner.

12407
07:29:52,990 --> 07:29:54,330
I'm making a fucking wall.

12408
07:29:54,410 --> 07:29:55,030
I'm making a wall.

12409
07:29:55,190 --> 07:29:56,510
I need to check on my dog.

12410
07:29:56,570 --> 07:29:57,610
I need to know why he's howling.

12411
07:29:59,190 --> 07:29:59,890
We're back.

12412
07:29:59,990 --> 07:30:03,270
He's like, I don't know, check in here.

12413
07:30:03,390 --> 07:30:05,790
I was like, oh my God, why are you howling up your back?

12414
07:30:08,070 --> 07:30:08,790
Oh my God.

12415
07:30:10,510 --> 07:30:11,170
Oh, shoot.

12416
07:30:14,430 --> 07:30:16,210
I got hit by arrows.

12417
07:30:21,440 --> 07:30:22,840
I'm also gonna block this up.

12418
07:30:22,900 --> 07:30:24,880
Why do they keep spawning even though I put...

12419
07:30:26,080 --> 07:30:27,380
Maybe it's too dark here.

12420
07:30:28,800 --> 07:30:29,940
I thought that was one of them.

12421
07:30:30,600 --> 07:30:31,280
Hey, you.

12422
07:30:31,740 --> 07:30:32,240
Come here.

12423
07:30:35,460 --> 07:30:36,940
Blaze, blaze, blaze, blaze, blaze.

12424
07:30:45,030 --> 07:30:46,590
How many magma cubes we got?

12425
07:30:46,890 --> 07:30:47,730
Only one?

12426
07:30:47,930 --> 07:30:49,410
We have the one magma cream?

12427
07:30:50,570 --> 07:30:51,330
Torches don't work?

12428
07:30:51,610 --> 07:30:53,030
No, they usually work for the skellies.

12429
07:30:53,030 --> 07:30:54,750
Why do I hear so many things?

12430
07:30:54,890 --> 07:30:59,410
I hear blaze, breeze, blaze, crackle, wither, skeleton, crackles.

12431
07:30:59,590 --> 07:31:00,670
What's going on?

12432
07:31:02,050 --> 07:31:03,050
I don't know.

12433
07:31:03,570 --> 07:31:04,590
What's going on?

12434
07:31:04,630 --> 07:31:06,170
Is anything bad happening outside?

12435
07:31:07,330 --> 07:31:07,630
Okay.

12436
07:31:08,370 --> 07:31:11,610
I thought they worked in here for the skellies at least.

12437
07:31:11,710 --> 07:31:12,630
I thought the torches worked.

12438
07:31:12,670 --> 07:31:13,370
My dog's okay.

12439
07:31:13,490 --> 07:31:14,570
He's just...

12440
07:31:14,570 --> 07:31:15,690
He's being a little freaky.

12441
07:31:15,810 --> 07:31:17,110
Yeah, he's being a little freaky today.

12442
07:31:18,170 --> 07:31:21,150
Usually never... I think this is the second time I've ever heard him howl.

12443
07:31:21,210 --> 07:31:21,630
Oh my God.

12444
07:31:22,190 --> 07:31:23,450
Yeah, this is a big guy right here.

12445
07:31:24,250 --> 07:31:25,750
He's just like on his pillow.

12446
07:31:26,170 --> 07:31:26,670
Just chilling.

12447
07:31:29,030 --> 07:31:31,290
Get him, get him so we can get magma cream.

12448
07:31:32,990 --> 07:31:34,370
But watch out for the size.

12449
07:31:34,510 --> 07:31:35,630
Don't go so far out.

12450
07:31:35,930 --> 07:31:37,590
Oh wait, I forgot they like multiply.

12451
07:31:38,530 --> 07:31:38,930
Yeah.

12452
07:31:40,090 --> 07:31:41,050
And then again.

12453
07:31:41,650 --> 07:31:42,490
Yep, keep going.

12454
07:31:42,910 --> 07:31:42,950
And then again.

12455
07:31:43,550 --> 07:31:44,270
And then again.

12456
07:31:44,270 --> 07:31:46,810
And then again.

12457
07:31:48,050 --> 07:31:49,570
Did I get any magma cream?

12458
07:31:50,190 --> 07:31:51,110
You got me one.

12459
07:31:52,410 --> 07:31:53,750
Got rid of the bones again.

12460
07:31:54,730 --> 07:31:55,130
Okay.

12461
07:31:55,650 --> 07:31:56,590
You can hand it to me.

12462
07:31:56,650 --> 07:31:57,250
I have the magma cream.

12463
07:31:57,250 --> 07:31:58,830
Do we need soul sand or soul soil?

12464
07:31:59,410 --> 07:32:00,730
None of... We don't need either.

12465
07:32:01,170 --> 07:32:03,210
Don't you need to plant the warts in the soul soil?

12466
07:32:03,850 --> 07:32:04,850
No, we have plenty.

12467
07:32:05,450 --> 07:32:06,910
Okay, so I'll get rid of that.

12468
07:32:07,030 --> 07:32:07,270
Okay.

12469
07:32:10,070 --> 07:32:10,970
Okay, here we go.

12470
07:32:11,570 --> 07:32:12,110
Come here.

12471
07:32:12,630 --> 07:32:13,350
Come here.

12472
07:32:14,270 --> 07:32:15,510
Come over here.

12473
07:32:16,810 --> 07:32:19,310
What if I kill him with my bow and arrow and then you...

12474
07:32:19,310 --> 07:32:20,650
Why did you just stand there?

12475
07:32:20,870 --> 07:32:21,970
I just wanna look at him.

12476
07:32:22,030 --> 07:32:23,230
I'm gonna kill him and then you parkour.

12477
07:32:24,170 --> 07:32:24,610
No!

12478
07:32:25,670 --> 07:32:26,670
How was our parkour?

12479
07:32:26,770 --> 07:32:27,530
He's too far.

12480
07:32:28,010 --> 07:32:28,550
No, he's not.

12481
07:32:28,610 --> 07:32:29,610
He's literally right there.

12482
07:32:29,910 --> 07:32:31,670
It was... There wasn't any rods anyway.

12483
07:32:31,810 --> 07:32:32,570
It doesn't matter.

12484
07:32:33,150 --> 07:32:34,390
It doesn't matter.

12485
07:32:34,410 --> 07:32:35,890
You didn't find any lava probably.

12486
07:32:36,010 --> 07:32:36,830
No, I didn't.

12487
07:32:36,930 --> 07:32:38,790
There was no lava over there.

12488
07:32:39,670 --> 07:32:40,550
Yeah, yeah.

12489
07:32:41,010 --> 07:32:42,090
Likely story.

12490
07:32:42,870 --> 07:32:44,970
Oh my gosh, there's so many wither skellies here.

12491
07:32:45,210 --> 07:32:47,090
Just keep spawning, I think.

12492
07:32:47,410 --> 07:32:47,570
I know.

12493
07:32:47,970 --> 07:32:48,350
Wait, wait, wait.

12494
07:32:48,410 --> 07:32:49,730
There's a blaze rod right in front of me.

12495
07:32:49,850 --> 07:32:50,390
I'm gonna do it.

12496
07:32:50,930 --> 07:32:51,530
Blaze rod?

12497
07:32:51,870 --> 07:32:52,930
I mean blaze, blaze.

12498
07:32:53,090 --> 07:32:53,630
I'm gonna do it.

12499
07:32:53,630 --> 07:32:54,710
No, you're not gonna be able to get...

12500
07:32:54,710 --> 07:32:55,390
Oh my god, Doki-Doki.

12501
07:32:55,390 --> 07:32:56,290
I'm gonna do it.

12502
07:32:56,450 --> 07:32:57,030
Doki-Doki.

12503
07:32:57,210 --> 07:32:58,270
I'm gonna do it.

12504
07:32:58,590 --> 07:32:58,910
Doki.

12505
07:32:59,710 --> 07:33:00,210
I'm coming back.

12506
07:33:00,270 --> 07:33:00,770
I'm coming back.

12507
07:33:00,870 --> 07:33:01,350
I'm coming back.

12508
07:33:01,470 --> 07:33:02,090
I'm coming back.

12509
07:33:02,150 --> 07:33:02,930
I'm coming back.

12510
07:33:04,010 --> 07:33:05,390
I realized it was a mistake.

12511
07:33:12,090 --> 07:33:13,130
That was so fast.

12512
07:33:14,190 --> 07:33:14,910
Wait, hold on.

12513
07:33:15,050 --> 07:33:17,330
I gotta build a wall, because...

12514
07:33:17,330 --> 07:33:18,230
Oh, that's it?

12515
07:33:18,310 --> 07:33:18,770
That's it.

12516
07:33:18,810 --> 07:33:19,470
That's your wall.

12517
07:33:20,750 --> 07:33:21,230
Thanks.

12518
07:33:21,430 --> 07:33:23,710
I gotta check if my YouTube keeps freezing.

12519
07:33:25,890 --> 07:33:27,210
The chat's frozen, guys.

12520
07:33:27,250 --> 07:33:27,630
I'm sorry.

12521
07:33:28,410 --> 07:33:29,010
I'm sorry.

12522
07:33:31,530 --> 07:33:32,450
One second.

12523
07:33:32,570 --> 07:33:35,790
Just in case... Just in case, like, I get fucked over too.

12524
07:33:37,190 --> 07:33:40,450
I gotta make sure that I'm also safe.

12525
07:33:44,370 --> 07:33:46,110
Oh, I hear so many noises.

12526
07:33:46,330 --> 07:33:48,810
I hear so many noises around us.

12527
07:33:53,030 --> 07:33:53,890
Okay, are we safe?

12528
07:33:54,990 --> 07:33:56,890
Doki's counter says mint death 3.

12529
07:33:57,430 --> 07:33:58,090
No, it doesn't.

12530
07:34:00,310 --> 07:34:01,310
I'm gaslighting you.

12531
07:34:01,390 --> 07:34:02,270
Why are you in here?

12532
07:34:02,430 --> 07:34:02,890
What the hell?

12533
07:34:02,930 --> 07:34:03,930
I was scared!

12534
07:34:04,710 --> 07:34:06,770
Oh my god, you have to be able to handle yourself.

12535
07:34:06,990 --> 07:34:08,290
Wait, how do I get out of here?

12536
07:34:08,470 --> 07:34:10,330
We go like this.

12537
07:34:10,430 --> 07:34:10,970
Oh, okay.

12538
07:34:10,970 --> 07:34:13,030
What do you mean how do we get out of here?

12539
07:34:13,230 --> 07:34:14,070
I couldn't tell.

12540
07:34:14,190 --> 07:34:14,890
It was dark.

12541
07:34:15,290 --> 07:34:15,630
Okay.

12542
07:34:17,190 --> 07:34:19,330
There must be a Blaze right above us.

12543
07:34:19,450 --> 07:34:20,350
We should go get him.

12544
07:34:20,610 --> 07:34:21,350
Yeah, I hear him.

12545
07:34:23,810 --> 07:34:25,970
There's a lot of things right above us.

12546
07:34:26,450 --> 07:34:29,270
What the hell is going on up here?

12547
07:34:29,670 --> 07:34:30,510
It's a party!

12548
07:34:33,610 --> 07:34:37,590
Yeah, I wouldn't do that.

12549
07:34:37,830 --> 07:34:38,750
Yeah, what are you gonna do?

12550
07:34:38,750 --> 07:34:40,910
I'm gonna look for Blazes in other areas.

12551
07:34:40,970 --> 07:34:42,250
What are you gonna do, slam me?

12552
07:34:42,730 --> 07:34:44,290
Oh my god, don't give me a good time.

12553
07:34:44,310 --> 07:34:45,790
Other Blazes in your area.

12554
07:34:45,930 --> 07:34:47,470
Don't give me a good time.

12555
07:34:49,330 --> 07:34:50,530
We'll get the magma cream.

12556
07:34:51,670 --> 07:34:52,930
Yeah, I'm getting the magma now.

12557
07:34:54,130 --> 07:34:56,470
Wait, did we ever went upstairs like this?

12558
07:34:57,330 --> 07:34:58,470
No, because it's scary.

12559
07:34:59,910 --> 07:35:00,250
Okay.

12560
07:35:00,890 --> 07:35:01,730
Oh my god.

12561
07:35:02,470 --> 07:35:03,870
Oh my god, please.

12562
07:35:03,990 --> 07:35:04,750
I'm just...

12563
07:35:05,450 --> 07:35:06,390
Please get closer.

12564
07:35:08,230 --> 07:35:10,410
There's another magma cream right here.

12565
07:35:10,510 --> 07:35:13,530
Oh shit.

12566
07:35:13,770 --> 07:35:14,830
Oh my god.

12567
07:35:15,810 --> 07:35:17,550
Did you grab the magma cream?

12568
07:35:18,290 --> 07:35:18,710
Hold on.

12569
07:35:19,870 --> 07:35:20,590
Where is it?

12570
07:35:20,910 --> 07:35:21,450
Oh my god.

12571
07:35:21,670 --> 07:35:22,950
Oh my god, there's so many.

12572
07:35:23,110 --> 07:35:24,190
I know, I know, I know.

12573
07:35:24,290 --> 07:35:25,230
That's what...

12574
07:35:25,230 --> 07:35:26,070
They're multiplying.

12575
07:35:26,910 --> 07:35:29,050
I like how this one pig is just watching us.

12576
07:35:30,350 --> 07:35:32,130
At least there's no Blazes up here.

12577
07:35:32,130 --> 07:35:34,170
We also have to get rid of these guys because then...

12578
07:35:34,910 --> 07:35:36,130
It'll spawn like other...

12579
07:35:36,670 --> 07:35:37,870
Oh, we have been here.

12580
07:35:39,870 --> 07:35:41,430
Yeah, we've been up this way, yeah.

12581
07:35:41,650 --> 07:35:42,810
Yeah, you said we haven't.

12582
07:35:43,210 --> 07:35:45,330
No, I thought you meant like on...

12583
07:35:45,330 --> 07:35:47,010
In that little area room.

12584
07:35:47,830 --> 07:35:48,390
There we go.

12585
07:35:48,830 --> 07:35:49,370
How many...

12586
07:35:49,370 --> 07:35:50,610
I have only two.

12587
07:35:50,950 --> 07:35:52,030
I have one of them.

12588
07:35:52,150 --> 07:35:53,030
You got the other one.

12589
07:35:53,710 --> 07:35:54,430
This sucks.

12590
07:35:54,510 --> 07:35:55,470
They're not dropping anything.

12591
07:35:57,450 --> 07:35:58,950
They're so far away.

12592
07:35:59,450 --> 07:36:01,290
Why can't they spawn faster?

12593
07:36:01,290 --> 07:36:02,990
Put out some torches, Mint.

12594
07:36:03,070 --> 07:36:04,090
So mobs spawn inside.

12595
07:36:04,530 --> 07:36:05,470
Which is it?

12596
07:36:05,530 --> 07:36:07,030
Do the torches work?

12597
07:36:07,170 --> 07:36:08,430
Do the torches not work?

12598
07:36:08,630 --> 07:36:11,630
I just said that the torches don't work.

12599
07:36:12,210 --> 07:36:12,730
No!

12600
07:36:13,950 --> 07:36:14,730
What is it?

12601
07:36:15,290 --> 07:36:16,850
I got fucking sniped.

12602
07:36:17,410 --> 07:36:19,230
He's like all the way over there.

12603
07:36:19,350 --> 07:36:20,170
How did you snipe me?

12604
07:36:20,870 --> 07:36:22,770
That's why you don't go out there.

12605
07:36:25,210 --> 07:36:27,230
We know there's a spawner...

12606
07:36:27,230 --> 07:36:29,050
But the spawner is danger zone.

12607
07:36:29,050 --> 07:36:30,310
We can't get to there.

12608
07:36:30,330 --> 07:36:31,850
The spawner is really far, guys.

12609
07:36:31,850 --> 07:36:32,770
We can't get there.

12610
07:36:32,930 --> 07:36:34,090
It's like separated.

12611
07:36:34,390 --> 07:36:35,410
We can't cross.

12612
07:36:37,230 --> 07:36:38,550
Oh, gosh.

12613
07:36:39,030 --> 07:36:41,630
Right below where you were is a spawner thing?

12614
07:36:41,830 --> 07:36:42,650
Below us?

12615
07:36:43,070 --> 07:36:43,410
Below?

12616
07:36:44,250 --> 07:36:45,790
I think maybe they mean...

12617
07:36:45,790 --> 07:36:47,210
Oh my God, hello.

12618
07:36:47,730 --> 07:36:49,490
How did he get here?

12619
07:36:49,950 --> 07:36:51,630
He spawned.

12620
07:36:53,200 --> 07:36:54,300
We got two.

12621
07:36:56,180 --> 07:36:58,860
There's a much closer spawner.

12622
07:37:00,420 --> 07:37:01,300
There is?

12623
07:37:02,020 --> 07:37:03,240
I feel like we walked everywhere.

12624
07:37:03,580 --> 07:37:05,340
I feel like we walked everywhere too.

12625
07:37:06,160 --> 07:37:06,560
Yeah.

12626
07:37:08,120 --> 07:37:09,520
We went down here, yeah.

12627
07:37:13,060 --> 07:37:14,320
We're getting one guide.

12628
07:37:14,480 --> 07:37:15,180
I can't tell.

12629
07:37:15,300 --> 07:37:18,680
There's one guy that said we're getting one guide, but then there's three people said that...

12630
07:37:18,680 --> 07:37:20,060
There's a spawner that's closer.

12631
07:37:20,320 --> 07:37:22,160
I know, sometimes people will say one guide, but...

12632
07:37:22,160 --> 07:37:24,800
But multiple people will say the same thing.

12633
07:37:25,000 --> 07:37:26,600
So I don't know.

12634
07:37:27,140 --> 07:37:27,980
Oh, hello.

12635
07:37:29,980 --> 07:37:30,260
Um...

12636
07:37:30,540 --> 07:37:31,020
I'm trying.

12637
07:37:33,080 --> 07:37:33,640
Um...

12638
07:37:33,640 --> 07:37:34,240
I'm trying.

12639
07:37:36,020 --> 07:37:38,200
It's next to the broken bridge?

12640
07:37:38,360 --> 07:37:39,520
There's a broken bridge?

12641
07:37:45,900 --> 07:37:46,860
I'm not okay.

12642
07:37:47,000 --> 07:37:47,740
I'm not okay.

12643
07:37:47,860 --> 07:37:48,700
I'm not okay.

12644
07:37:51,940 --> 07:37:54,260
Remember when I said I wasn't okay?

12645
07:37:54,520 --> 07:37:54,860
Yeah.

12646
07:37:56,440 --> 07:37:57,740
I got hit.

12647
07:37:57,820 --> 07:37:58,440
I got hit too.

12648
07:37:59,020 --> 07:37:59,540
Bye.

12649
07:38:00,740 --> 07:38:01,740
It's a pope.

12650
07:38:01,980 --> 07:38:02,660
It's a Skelly.

12651
07:38:02,820 --> 07:38:03,560
It's a Skelly.

12652
07:38:03,740 --> 07:38:04,700
Regular Skelly.

12653
07:38:04,900 --> 07:38:06,200
Regular old Joe Skelly.

12654
07:38:06,440 --> 07:38:06,800
Come on.

12655
07:38:07,560 --> 07:38:08,400
Watch out.

12656
07:38:11,380 --> 07:38:12,740
On the top floor?

12657
07:38:12,900 --> 07:38:14,860
Right below the broken bridge?

12658
07:38:18,040 --> 07:38:20,160
What the fuck does any of those words mean?

12659
07:38:21,220 --> 07:38:23,100
On the top floor?

12660
07:38:23,100 --> 07:38:25,920
Right below a broken bridge.

12661
07:38:26,040 --> 07:38:27,100
There is a...

12662
07:38:27,780 --> 07:38:28,800
Blaze spawner.

12663
07:38:29,760 --> 07:38:30,840
This floor?

12664
07:38:31,660 --> 07:38:33,220
The floor I'm on right now?

12665
07:38:33,700 --> 07:38:34,880
The scary floor?

12666
07:38:35,660 --> 07:38:36,360
Right here?

12667
07:38:37,920 --> 07:38:39,820
Right before a broken bridge?

12668
07:38:40,020 --> 07:38:40,660
Right here?

12669
07:38:41,660 --> 07:38:42,160
Oh my god.

12670
07:38:42,660 --> 07:38:43,560
In the middle of summer?

12671
07:38:46,120 --> 07:38:47,220
Make shops?

12672
07:38:47,380 --> 07:38:49,260
I just start spamming.

12673
07:38:49,380 --> 07:38:50,620
I forget to make the shops.

12674
07:38:50,620 --> 07:38:51,580
This is the top floor.

12675
07:38:52,520 --> 07:38:54,060
This is the very top.

12676
07:38:56,240 --> 07:38:56,920
Here?

12677
07:38:57,400 --> 07:38:59,040
This is a broken bridge?

12678
07:38:59,460 --> 07:39:00,660
That broken bridge?

12679
07:39:01,520 --> 07:39:02,440
Watch out.

12680
07:39:02,820 --> 07:39:04,480
There's a guy who's gonna start shooting.

12681
07:39:04,600 --> 07:39:06,120
There's 200 fucking things here.

12682
07:39:07,140 --> 07:39:08,840
I just left it?

12683
07:39:08,940 --> 07:39:10,640
Right here to my left?

12684
07:39:12,020 --> 07:39:12,720
This one?

12685
07:39:21,580 --> 07:39:22,300
Right here?

12686
07:39:22,420 --> 07:39:22,460
Right here?

12687
07:39:22,460 --> 07:39:23,380
In the middle of the fortress?

12688
07:39:25,560 --> 07:39:26,480
Oh, there it is.

12689
07:39:32,940 --> 07:39:33,720
It's right there.

12690
07:39:33,900 --> 07:39:35,080
Look at the corner to your left.

12691
07:39:35,220 --> 07:39:37,300
I think it's the wither spawner.

12692
07:39:37,740 --> 07:39:40,240
There is no wither spawner.

12693
07:39:40,240 --> 07:39:41,220
Oh, wait.

12694
07:39:41,740 --> 07:39:42,520
Maybe it is.

12695
07:39:42,580 --> 07:39:44,280
I think this is the wither spawner.

12696
07:39:44,680 --> 07:39:45,800
Oh my god.

12697
07:39:46,660 --> 07:39:48,040
It's just a wither...

12698
07:39:48,040 --> 07:39:49,360
Wait, is that a thing?

12699
07:39:49,440 --> 07:39:50,040
A wither spawner?

12700
07:39:50,100 --> 07:39:51,360
Oh my god.

12701
07:39:53,780 --> 07:39:54,860
I'm pretty sure.

12702
07:39:55,000 --> 07:39:56,540
That's like three...

12703
07:39:56,540 --> 07:39:57,380
There's no...

12704
07:39:57,380 --> 07:39:57,940
It's a blaze!

12705
07:39:58,280 --> 07:40:01,180
Oh shit.

12706
07:40:01,860 --> 07:40:04,560
I was gonna say, I don't think blaze spawners exist.

12707
07:40:05,820 --> 07:40:07,460
I'm trying to get rid of the skellies.

12708
07:40:08,180 --> 07:40:09,080
Get rid of everything.

12709
07:40:09,160 --> 07:40:09,780
Oh my god.

12710
07:40:10,960 --> 07:40:12,100
We gotta build a bridge.

12711
07:40:13,000 --> 07:40:16,780
Okay, one of us has to build and one of us has to take out the guys.

12712
07:40:16,920 --> 07:40:17,620
Okay, I got you.

12713
07:40:19,200 --> 07:40:20,020
I got the arrows.

12714
07:40:20,280 --> 07:40:20,440
Oh, sorry.

12715
07:40:24,720 --> 07:40:25,040
Okay.

12716
07:40:26,560 --> 07:40:27,700
You can actually...

12717
07:40:27,700 --> 07:40:28,120
Oh my god.

12718
07:40:28,260 --> 07:40:29,600
You need to defend yourself too though.

12719
07:40:29,700 --> 07:40:30,360
Okay, I'm gonna eat.

12720
07:40:31,760 --> 07:40:32,740
I'm running out of arrows.

12721
07:40:32,860 --> 07:40:33,860
I just need you to know that.

12722
07:40:34,380 --> 07:40:35,440
Oh, that's not good.

12723
07:40:35,440 --> 07:40:36,380
That's not great.

12724
07:40:36,620 --> 07:40:37,880
Don't do it.

12725
07:40:37,900 --> 07:40:38,260
Don't cross.

12726
07:40:39,440 --> 07:40:40,580
It's a bad idea.

12727
07:40:41,160 --> 07:40:42,020
I have my shield up.

12728
07:40:43,360 --> 07:40:44,900
I need to make bread.

12729
07:40:45,000 --> 07:40:46,060
I'm running out of food.

12730
07:40:46,120 --> 07:40:48,740
Okay, there's three guys now, so...

12731
07:40:48,740 --> 07:40:49,940
I'm making bread.

12732
07:40:50,840 --> 07:40:51,580
Just calm down.

12733
07:40:52,580 --> 07:40:53,360
I'm calm.

12734
07:40:55,720 --> 07:40:56,520
Oh my god.

12735
07:40:56,620 --> 07:40:58,360
And then there's a gas?

12736
07:41:02,950 --> 07:41:05,810
I don't think I will be able to make it enough, everybody.

12737
07:41:05,810 --> 07:41:07,470
Oh my god, please.

12738
07:41:07,870 --> 07:41:09,610
I'm gonna fail this.

12739
07:41:13,410 --> 07:41:14,730
Where's our gas from?

12740
07:41:15,870 --> 07:41:16,550
Oh my god.

12741
07:41:16,550 --> 07:41:17,590
Stop getting hit!

12742
07:41:17,710 --> 07:41:21,070
I killed two.

12743
07:41:21,830 --> 07:41:23,770
Oh my god, you're gaming right now?

12744
07:41:24,290 --> 07:41:25,890
I ran out of arrows, so it's up to you.

12745
07:41:26,170 --> 07:41:26,830
I killed three.

12746
07:41:27,430 --> 07:41:28,310
Alright, you did it.

12747
07:41:28,330 --> 07:41:29,830
You should be able to go now.

12748
07:41:30,450 --> 07:41:31,170
Okay, but...

12749
07:41:31,170 --> 07:41:31,910
Help me.

12750
07:41:32,210 --> 07:41:32,310
Here.

12751
07:41:33,050 --> 07:41:34,790
I give you half.

12752
07:41:34,790 --> 07:41:34,950
How?

12753
07:41:35,730 --> 07:41:36,830
Take it.

12754
07:41:37,250 --> 07:41:39,030
I need to know there's a gas somewhere.

12755
07:41:40,850 --> 07:41:41,330
Somewhere.

12756
07:41:42,970 --> 07:41:44,730
Okay, I'm gonna speed this.

12757
07:41:46,050 --> 07:41:46,550
Oh my god.

12758
07:41:46,690 --> 07:41:48,010
Come back.

12759
07:41:48,390 --> 07:41:49,470
I heard a blaze.

12760
07:41:50,690 --> 07:41:51,570
He's right here.

12761
07:41:51,770 --> 07:41:52,230
Build a wall.

12762
07:41:54,390 --> 07:41:56,530
You keep building the bridge.

12763
07:41:56,810 --> 07:41:58,570
He came back.

12764
07:41:58,810 --> 07:41:59,390
Gas came back.

12765
07:42:00,970 --> 07:42:01,830
I gotta eat.

12766
07:42:01,830 --> 07:42:02,330
I gotta eat.

12767
07:42:03,310 --> 07:42:04,310
I'm gonna drink it.

12768
07:42:04,430 --> 07:42:05,510
I'm gonna drink fire resistance.

12769
07:42:05,850 --> 07:42:06,610
I'm gonna die.

12770
07:42:07,710 --> 07:42:09,570
Actually, that might be the good...

12771
07:42:09,570 --> 07:42:11,150
Actually, this might be the good time to do it.

12772
07:42:11,370 --> 07:42:11,930
I'm gonna do it.

12773
07:42:14,050 --> 07:42:14,830
Keep building.

12774
07:42:16,890 --> 07:42:18,630
I need you to build for me.

12775
07:42:18,730 --> 07:42:20,110
What do you mean?

12776
07:42:20,310 --> 07:42:21,670
You have the fire resistance.

12777
07:42:22,150 --> 07:42:22,930
Will I still get hit?

12778
07:42:23,970 --> 07:42:25,190
Gas, you can get hit.

12779
07:42:27,270 --> 07:42:28,130
Won't I die?

12780
07:42:30,610 --> 07:42:31,430
I don't have...

12781
07:42:32,670 --> 07:42:33,470
This is bad.

12782
07:42:33,670 --> 07:42:34,090
I might die.

12783
07:42:35,430 --> 07:42:35,870
No!

12784
07:42:37,230 --> 07:42:38,630
Just spam attack.

12785
07:42:38,890 --> 07:42:40,770
The fire can't hurt you right now.

12786
07:42:40,850 --> 07:42:43,330
I'm getting hit by so many.

12787
07:42:43,890 --> 07:42:44,770
Please help me.

12788
07:42:44,850 --> 07:42:45,550
I don't have torches.

12789
07:42:46,090 --> 07:42:46,810
I don't have torches.

12790
07:42:48,110 --> 07:42:49,070
I don't have torches.

12791
07:42:50,630 --> 07:42:51,730
Where are they?

12792
07:42:52,730 --> 07:42:53,370
Oh my god.

12793
07:42:53,470 --> 07:42:54,650
I gotta drink my potion.

12794
07:42:54,650 --> 07:42:55,610
I gotta drink my potion.

12795
07:42:55,730 --> 07:42:56,990
I'm hitting them.

12796
07:42:57,150 --> 07:42:58,050
I'm hitting them.

12797
07:43:01,430 --> 07:43:02,630
Okay, I'm coming in.

12798
07:43:03,950 --> 07:43:05,170
He's still hitting me.

12799
07:43:05,390 --> 07:43:07,510
It doesn't hurt me, but why am I still getting hit?

12800
07:43:07,790 --> 07:43:09,190
Why am I still getting hit?

12801
07:43:10,070 --> 07:43:10,830
Wait, really?

12802
07:43:11,150 --> 07:43:11,950
With the fire even?

12803
07:43:12,210 --> 07:43:12,410
Yeah.

12804
07:43:14,110 --> 07:43:15,850
Wait, do you have torches?

12805
07:43:15,990 --> 07:43:18,070
Someone said she has full HP.

12806
07:43:18,610 --> 07:43:19,710
Hey, I have 6.

12807
07:43:20,470 --> 07:43:21,690
What the fuck, man?

12808
07:43:23,250 --> 07:43:24,530
Okay, I'm out of torches.

12809
07:43:24,650 --> 07:43:25,850
I have torches.

12810
07:43:25,990 --> 07:43:26,930
I'm okay now.

12811
07:43:26,970 --> 07:43:27,890
I have 64 here.

12812
07:43:28,310 --> 07:43:29,350
Here are some torches.

12813
07:43:32,110 --> 07:43:33,770
Please, come over here and die.

12814
07:43:34,810 --> 07:43:36,330
I'm just gonna put this here for now.

12815
07:43:36,670 --> 07:43:37,770
I can't.

12816
07:43:37,890 --> 07:43:38,550
I don't want...

12817
07:43:40,450 --> 07:43:42,510
I need these guys to get out first.

12818
07:43:42,790 --> 07:43:44,330
I need them to leave first.

12819
07:43:44,750 --> 07:43:44,910
Okay, hold on.

12820
07:43:45,870 --> 07:43:48,630
We'll let them spawn in when things start calming down.

12821
07:43:48,970 --> 07:43:49,890
He's on me.

12822
07:43:49,890 --> 07:43:50,490
He's on me.

12823
07:43:50,550 --> 07:43:51,010
Oh my God.

12824
07:43:51,950 --> 07:43:54,050
There's 26 on me, too!

12825
07:43:58,710 --> 07:44:00,510
Oh, they can do melee damage?

12826
07:44:00,730 --> 07:44:01,090
Wow.

12827
07:44:01,870 --> 07:44:03,770
Give them more stuff to do, I guess.

12828
07:44:07,970 --> 07:44:09,930
Blaze rod, blaze rod, blaze rod, blaze rod.

12829
07:44:10,110 --> 07:44:11,690
I have four blaze rods.

12830
07:44:12,190 --> 07:44:13,050
I can't pick it up.

12831
07:44:13,150 --> 07:44:13,830
I need you to pick it up.

12832
07:44:14,250 --> 07:44:15,610
I got it, I got it, I got it.

12833
07:44:16,790 --> 07:44:18,070
It's up here, it's up here, it's up here.

12834
07:44:22,240 --> 07:44:24,740
What's the point of attacking these bozos?

12835
07:44:25,760 --> 07:44:28,240
Oh my God, I'm getting a stomachache from all this.

12836
07:44:28,500 --> 07:44:31,500
Oh my God, I'm gonna freaking freak out soon.

12837
07:44:33,060 --> 07:44:34,100
How much is left?

12838
07:44:34,680 --> 07:44:36,760
Okay, a minute and a half left on my thing.

12839
07:44:36,780 --> 07:44:37,920
You probably have less than.

12840
07:44:38,580 --> 07:44:40,880
This is gonna be my fifth freakout right here.

12841
07:44:41,740 --> 07:44:43,620
Oh, I just fell inside.

12842
07:44:43,760 --> 07:44:44,140
Oh my God.

12843
07:44:44,180 --> 07:44:45,320
Oh no.

12844
07:44:48,460 --> 07:44:50,060
Alright, they're gonna spawn in again.

12845
07:44:51,300 --> 07:44:51,740
Okay.

12846
07:44:52,800 --> 07:44:54,280
I'm building our escape route.

12847
07:44:55,180 --> 07:44:56,720
While it's calm.

12848
07:44:57,180 --> 07:44:57,960
I don't have arrows.

12849
07:44:58,140 --> 07:44:58,540
Do you have?

12850
07:44:58,600 --> 07:44:59,020
Oh, I do.

12851
07:45:01,180 --> 07:45:02,160
How many do I have?

12852
07:45:02,180 --> 07:45:04,200
Try and kill them here though.

12853
07:45:04,280 --> 07:45:06,260
How many do I have left?

12854
07:45:06,320 --> 07:45:07,880
I can't see, I can't see.

12855
07:45:08,400 --> 07:45:09,220
Use your shield.

12856
07:45:10,360 --> 07:45:11,740
One second is gone.

12857
07:45:12,080 --> 07:45:12,960
I don't have fire resistance.

12858
07:45:13,160 --> 07:45:14,200
I'm waiting for the spawner.

12859
07:45:14,500 --> 07:45:15,940
I got another, I got another.

12860
07:45:16,320 --> 07:45:17,900
I got five.

12861
07:45:17,900 --> 07:45:19,040
I got five.

12862
07:45:19,200 --> 07:45:19,860
Wait, you have six, right?

12863
07:45:19,920 --> 07:45:20,440
You have one, right?

12864
07:45:21,020 --> 07:45:21,540
I have one.

12865
07:45:21,780 --> 07:45:22,480
Okay, we got it.

12866
07:45:22,500 --> 07:45:24,700
Oh shit, oh shit.

12867
07:45:24,960 --> 07:45:26,740
You're fine, you're fine, you're fine.

12868
07:45:28,380 --> 07:45:29,700
There's another arrow, there's another one.

12869
07:45:30,340 --> 07:45:31,380
Oh my God, these guys.

12870
07:45:31,560 --> 07:45:33,580
I'm gonna murder them, I'm gonna murder them.

12871
07:45:34,540 --> 07:45:35,980
Stupid skellies, I hate them so much.

12872
07:45:36,180 --> 07:45:38,600
Oh, there's another spawner in front of us?

12873
07:45:38,720 --> 07:45:39,680
Yes, there's another.

12874
07:45:39,840 --> 07:45:41,860
That's the one that I was looking at.

12875
07:45:43,660 --> 07:45:45,340
I was not looking at that one.

12876
07:45:45,340 --> 07:45:47,140
I'm gonna block, I'm gonna block this area.

12877
07:45:47,240 --> 07:45:48,160
I'm gonna block this area.

12878
07:45:48,500 --> 07:45:51,200
I need a heal before we go in.

12879
07:45:51,440 --> 07:45:52,400
I can, okay, I can.

12880
07:45:52,780 --> 07:45:52,920
Okay,

12881
07:45:55,960 --> 07:45:57,000
I have six.

12882
07:45:57,080 --> 07:45:57,500
I have six.

12883
07:45:57,620 --> 07:45:58,100
We need...

12884
07:45:58,100 --> 07:45:59,760
Oh, I need ten, okay.

12885
07:46:01,480 --> 07:46:03,460
I'll break the torches again.

12886
07:46:03,860 --> 07:46:05,100
I needed it to calm down.

12887
07:46:05,200 --> 07:46:07,960
I needed things to calm down before they start spawning.

12888
07:46:08,200 --> 07:46:09,180
I'm blocking these walls.

12889
07:46:11,700 --> 07:46:13,020
Okay, I'm blocking...

12890
07:46:14,440 --> 07:46:15,780
Blocking these walls too.

12891
07:46:16,260 --> 07:46:16,780
Actually...

12892
07:46:16,780 --> 07:46:19,240
Yeah, like, make it so that when they spawn in...

12893
07:46:19,840 --> 07:46:20,620
They can't leave.

12894
07:46:21,440 --> 07:46:22,640
Oh my god, no!

12895
07:46:24,480 --> 07:46:25,280
Are you okay?

12896
07:46:25,680 --> 07:46:26,100
No.

12897
07:46:26,900 --> 07:46:27,780
Oh my god, hello.

12898
07:46:28,140 --> 07:46:28,500
Oh my god.

12899
07:46:28,740 --> 07:46:29,900
I'm not okay.

12900
07:46:30,860 --> 07:46:33,480
I need a heal, I'm not okay.

12901
07:46:33,720 --> 07:46:35,340
I'm not okay anymore.

12902
07:46:35,680 --> 07:46:37,540
How is there a guy here?

12903
07:46:40,100 --> 07:46:41,380
Okay, I need a heal.

12904
07:46:41,380 --> 07:46:42,840
Yeah, go heal, go heal!

12905
07:46:43,280 --> 07:46:44,620
I'm not okay, I'm actually...

12906
07:46:44,620 --> 07:46:46,320
I'm gonna fucking collapse.

12907
07:46:47,000 --> 07:46:47,780
Okay, I healed up.

12908
07:46:48,580 --> 07:46:50,440
I got two, I got two rounds.

12909
07:46:50,740 --> 07:46:52,160
Okay, we have A, we have A.

12910
07:46:54,700 --> 07:46:57,220
Oh, your helmet broke.

12911
07:46:57,440 --> 07:46:58,600
Oh, is that why?

12912
07:46:58,740 --> 07:47:00,480
Okay, that makes more sense.

12913
07:47:00,540 --> 07:47:02,320
That's why I was taking so much fucking damage.

12914
07:47:03,020 --> 07:47:04,200
Oh my god!

12915
07:47:04,500 --> 07:47:05,240
Oh my god.

12916
07:47:06,860 --> 07:47:08,900
Go back, go back, go back!

12917
07:47:09,920 --> 07:47:10,840
Throw a grenade!

12918
07:47:13,940 --> 07:47:14,940
Oh my god.

12919
07:47:15,360 --> 07:47:16,560
Imagine if I get...

12920
07:47:16,560 --> 07:47:19,320
Oh my god, when they're on fire, they're about to, like, attack.

12921
07:47:19,520 --> 07:47:23,960
So, like, attack when they're not on fire, and then, like, shield up when they get on fire.

12922
07:47:25,560 --> 07:47:27,020
Oh my god, how did that still hit me?

12923
07:47:27,500 --> 07:47:28,760
How did that still hit me?

12924
07:47:29,000 --> 07:47:30,740
I'm backing up, don't be a hero, Mint.

12925
07:47:30,780 --> 07:47:31,920
Don't be a hero, don't be a hero.

12926
07:47:31,920 --> 07:47:32,960
Okay, I gotta heal, I gotta heal.

12927
07:47:35,340 --> 07:47:35,700
Nade!

12928
07:47:35,700 --> 07:47:37,960
I don't have arrows, guys!

12929
07:47:38,100 --> 07:47:38,540
Oh, I do.

12930
07:47:39,240 --> 07:47:39,980
That was my last arrow.

12931
07:47:40,080 --> 07:47:40,480
Do you have arrows?

12932
07:47:40,560 --> 07:47:40,940
Do you have arrows?

12933
07:47:41,940 --> 07:47:43,480
Uh, yes, here, spectral arrows.

12934
07:47:43,700 --> 07:47:44,320
There you go, there you go.

12935
07:47:44,460 --> 07:47:45,700
Give me all of it, give me all your arrows.

12936
07:47:52,380 --> 07:47:53,120
Oh my god.

12937
07:47:53,660 --> 07:47:55,000
Oh my god, they're still spotting.

12938
07:47:56,160 --> 07:47:57,520
Put torches on it, put torches on it.

12939
07:47:57,620 --> 07:47:59,220
I killed three, I killed three.

12940
07:48:00,980 --> 07:48:02,140
I don't have any more torches.

12941
07:48:02,900 --> 07:48:03,820
I have torches, okay.

12942
07:48:03,820 --> 07:48:03,880
Okay.

12943
07:48:05,920 --> 07:48:07,680
Oh my god, how's it still hitting me?

12944
07:48:07,720 --> 07:48:08,860
I don't have any more arrows.

12945
07:48:09,360 --> 07:48:11,500
I don't have any more arrows.

12946
07:48:12,640 --> 07:48:13,940
Ah, I don't have any more.

12947
07:48:14,380 --> 07:48:14,940
Okay, okay, okay.

12948
07:48:15,240 --> 07:48:16,000
I'm going in.

12949
07:48:19,040 --> 07:48:20,600
No, no, I can't risk it.

12950
07:48:20,600 --> 07:48:22,200
I can't risk it, I can't risk it.

12951
07:48:22,300 --> 07:48:23,160
Get out, get out, get out.

12952
07:48:24,900 --> 07:48:25,620
We just...

12953
07:48:25,620 --> 07:48:27,820
We can't get out, we can't...

12954
07:48:27,820 --> 07:48:32,000
The thing is, we have to return home, but this is the only way we can go home.

12955
07:48:33,820 --> 07:48:34,560
Oh my god.

12956
07:48:35,380 --> 07:48:38,040
This is the only... I'm drinking the other potion.

12957
07:48:38,120 --> 07:48:39,680
I'm drinking the other potion, I'm going in.

12958
07:48:40,200 --> 07:48:42,020
I'm drinking one more potion, I'm going in.

12959
07:48:42,220 --> 07:48:44,220
I'm going in, I'm going in with these potions.

12960
07:48:44,800 --> 07:48:45,480
Live, just live.

12961
07:48:46,760 --> 07:48:47,780
I'm going in.

12962
07:48:49,540 --> 07:48:50,820
I can't live.

12963
07:48:51,500 --> 07:48:53,600
I got another rod though, that's cool.

12964
07:48:54,340 --> 07:48:55,280
How many do we need?

12965
07:48:56,080 --> 07:48:57,120
I don't know.

12966
07:48:57,320 --> 07:48:59,900
I went in, I went in, I went in.

12967
07:49:02,620 --> 07:49:03,720
Oh my god.

12968
07:49:03,820 --> 07:49:03,920
Oh my god.

12969
07:49:03,920 --> 07:49:05,960
We have 10, we have 10, I have 10, I have 10.

12970
07:49:06,460 --> 07:49:07,360
We made it.

12971
07:49:08,200 --> 07:49:08,980
Get this guy.

12972
07:49:10,660 --> 07:49:11,100
Alright.

12973
07:49:11,900 --> 07:49:13,360
Okay, I think we can leave.

12974
07:49:13,480 --> 07:49:15,720
I made an escape route.

12975
07:49:16,060 --> 07:49:17,860
Yeah, we can leave now, yeah.

12976
07:49:18,800 --> 07:49:19,720
We did it.

12977
07:49:20,220 --> 07:49:22,060
We did it.

12978
07:49:22,400 --> 07:49:23,160
Do you have enough food?

12979
07:49:23,360 --> 07:49:23,760
Are you good?

12980
07:49:23,980 --> 07:49:24,720
Yeah, I'm good.

12981
07:49:26,320 --> 07:49:27,240
Oh my god.

12982
07:49:27,240 --> 07:49:28,880
Now we go home.

12983
07:49:33,420 --> 07:49:34,820
Going home.

12984
07:49:36,950 --> 07:49:38,480
Alright, do you have obsidian?

12985
07:49:39,080 --> 07:49:41,380
I have two obsidian.

12986
07:49:41,660 --> 07:49:42,260
I have...

12987
07:49:44,760 --> 07:49:47,860
Alright, time to walk over.

12988
07:49:49,480 --> 07:49:51,720
Wait, is it really 10 is enough?

12989
07:49:53,500 --> 07:49:54,580
We have 13.

12990
07:49:54,580 --> 07:49:56,020
With you, we have 13.

12991
07:49:57,220 --> 07:49:58,620
I'm gonna give you my other three.

12992
07:49:58,800 --> 07:50:00,360
We'll just keep them all together.

12993
07:50:02,700 --> 07:50:03,720
10 is minimum.

12994
07:50:04,500 --> 07:50:05,400
We have 13.

12995
07:50:05,940 --> 07:50:08,060
We have 13, that's good, that's good.

12996
07:50:08,380 --> 07:50:08,980
13 is good.

12997
07:50:09,140 --> 07:50:11,400
People were saying 14 is like the absolute safe.

12998
07:50:11,520 --> 07:50:12,340
So 13 is good.

12999
07:50:14,860 --> 07:50:16,020
Watch out, watch out, watch out!

13000
07:50:16,980 --> 07:50:17,880
What are you looking at?

13001
07:50:18,380 --> 07:50:19,480
What are you looking at?

13002
07:50:19,860 --> 07:50:21,500
Why are you wearing a gold...

13003
07:50:21,500 --> 07:50:22,960
Because my helmet's broken!

13004
07:50:23,160 --> 07:50:24,940
I don't wanna get beat up by the pigs!

13005
07:50:25,380 --> 07:50:26,580
No, oh...

13006
07:50:26,580 --> 07:50:28,240
Okay, okay, I got you.

13007
07:50:29,040 --> 07:50:30,200
Okay, how do we get out of here?

13008
07:50:30,220 --> 07:50:31,860
There's a gold chestplate if you need this.

13009
07:50:32,380 --> 07:50:33,400
Oh, okay, I'll take it.

13010
07:50:33,520 --> 07:50:34,800
Just in case your helmet breaks.

13011
07:50:38,110 --> 07:50:39,570
Oh my god, it's almost dead.

13012
07:50:42,530 --> 07:50:44,630
Alright, how do we go home?

13013
07:50:45,970 --> 07:50:47,590
How do we get out of here?

13014
07:50:47,610 --> 07:50:49,610
What would be the easiest way?

13015
07:50:49,610 --> 07:50:51,110
How do we...

13016
07:50:51,110 --> 07:50:52,970
We traveled very far.

13017
07:50:53,190 --> 07:50:54,510
Very far...

13018
07:50:54,510 --> 07:50:57,090
Let's just get out of the fortress first so that we...

13019
07:50:57,090 --> 07:50:58,710
Someone said trade for more obsidian.

13020
07:51:00,730 --> 07:51:01,250
Oh...

13021
07:51:01,250 --> 07:51:01,950
We should.

13022
07:51:02,310 --> 07:51:04,770
I left my crafting table so I gotta make another one.

13023
07:51:05,410 --> 07:51:06,430
Oh, I can make one.

13024
07:51:06,810 --> 07:51:07,610
I just made it.

13025
07:51:07,950 --> 07:51:11,050
Okay, so I'm gonna make the...

13026
07:51:11,050 --> 07:51:13,690
I'm watching out for any guys to attack.

13027
07:51:14,650 --> 07:51:16,410
Alright, do you have any nuggies or no?

13028
07:51:17,330 --> 07:51:18,230
No nuggies.

13029
07:51:18,230 --> 07:51:19,950
Alright, so I have...

13030
07:51:19,950 --> 07:51:21,790
I have 16 gold for obsidian.

13031
07:51:22,150 --> 07:51:23,330
How many obsidian do we need?

13032
07:51:24,170 --> 07:51:25,130
We need 10.

13033
07:51:25,290 --> 07:51:26,530
Okay, we have 4.

13034
07:51:27,270 --> 07:51:28,030
Yeah, we have 4.

13035
07:51:28,110 --> 07:51:28,850
Give me your obsidian.

13036
07:51:29,650 --> 07:51:29,890
Okay.

13037
07:51:31,830 --> 07:51:32,530
That's fine.

13038
07:51:32,750 --> 07:51:33,690
We're so paranoid.

13039
07:51:34,310 --> 07:51:34,590
I know.

13040
07:51:36,170 --> 07:51:37,430
We are paranoid.

13041
07:51:39,190 --> 07:51:40,550
Alright, we gotta figure out...

13042
07:51:40,550 --> 07:51:41,250
How do we get here?

13043
07:51:41,930 --> 07:51:43,410
You gotta go back to...

13044
07:51:43,410 --> 07:51:45,090
How did we get in here?

13045
07:51:45,090 --> 07:51:45,870
How did we get here?

13046
07:51:50,590 --> 07:51:52,090
Did you go down here?

13047
07:51:53,410 --> 07:51:54,390
I didn't open that.

13048
07:51:54,390 --> 07:51:54,890
No, I did.

13049
07:51:55,310 --> 07:51:57,010
We gotta find the other...

13050
07:51:57,010 --> 07:51:58,130
Assault place.

13051
07:52:02,580 --> 07:52:03,120
Oh, no.

13052
07:52:03,380 --> 07:52:04,440
No, not here.

13053
07:52:07,890 --> 07:52:08,810
Oh my god.

13054
07:52:09,030 --> 07:52:10,110
I can't believe we did it.

13055
07:52:10,450 --> 07:52:11,510
We actually did it.

13056
07:52:11,650 --> 07:52:12,950
We didn't get one guide.

13057
07:52:13,570 --> 07:52:14,030
I know.

13058
07:52:14,150 --> 07:52:17,250
I can't believe there's a Ouroborealis right here in the kitchen.

13059
07:52:19,790 --> 07:52:21,290
It was right here.

13060
07:52:21,750 --> 07:52:23,330
It was actually right here.

13061
07:52:29,820 --> 07:52:30,900
Oh my god.

13062
07:52:31,320 --> 07:52:32,920
I have such a bad stomachache right now.

13063
07:52:34,080 --> 07:52:36,700
I'm gonna puke up all my mac and cheese.

13064
07:52:37,520 --> 07:52:38,620
From the stress?

13065
07:52:39,360 --> 07:52:41,360
Yeah, from the stress of it all.

13066
07:52:43,420 --> 07:52:45,900
How did we get out in here?

13067
07:52:46,220 --> 07:52:47,540
How did we get here?

13068
07:52:47,940 --> 07:52:49,480
I don't understand.

13069
07:52:51,740 --> 07:52:52,940
Oh, is it here?

13070
07:52:53,780 --> 07:52:55,000
No, I'm just seeing...

13071
07:52:55,000 --> 07:52:56,120
No, I'm just seeing things.

13072
07:52:56,280 --> 07:52:58,280
I'm just seeing things.

13073
07:52:59,200 --> 07:52:59,920
I'm just...

13074
07:52:59,920 --> 07:53:03,400
I'm just seeing things now.

13075
07:53:03,540 --> 07:53:04,680
I don't know anymore.

13076
07:53:04,840 --> 07:53:06,160
Everything looks the same.

13077
07:53:06,940 --> 07:53:08,260
How did we get in here?

13078
07:53:08,300 --> 07:53:09,540
I don't know.

13079
07:53:10,280 --> 07:53:11,980
From the top of the fortress.

13080
07:53:12,560 --> 07:53:15,260
So, up here, but there was like other...

13081
07:53:15,260 --> 07:53:15,580
Oh, shit.

13082
07:53:15,580 --> 07:53:15,940
Wait, here?

13083
07:53:16,980 --> 07:53:18,160
I found it!

13084
07:53:18,980 --> 07:53:19,580
Where?

13085
07:53:21,100 --> 07:53:22,100
I found it.

13086
07:53:22,660 --> 07:53:25,080
Look at my name tag.

13087
07:53:25,560 --> 07:53:26,260
I don't see it.

13088
07:53:26,340 --> 07:53:26,920
Everything is...

13089
07:53:26,920 --> 07:53:27,900
Right here.

13090
07:53:32,830 --> 07:53:33,590
It's here.

13091
07:53:34,530 --> 07:53:36,950
I remember we dug that.

13092
07:53:37,070 --> 07:53:38,330
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

13093
07:53:43,160 --> 07:53:44,700
Wait a minute.

13094
07:53:45,380 --> 07:53:46,000
Wait a minute.

13095
07:53:46,000 --> 07:53:47,240
Did we not...

13096
07:53:47,240 --> 07:53:49,020
Oh, we came from above, remember?

13097
07:53:49,660 --> 07:53:51,600
Yeah, but there was an area that we dropped in.

13098
07:53:52,620 --> 07:53:54,240
Yeah, yeah, I built ourselves a stairs.

13099
07:53:54,680 --> 07:53:54,840
Okay.

13100
07:53:55,920 --> 07:53:56,460
Kind of.

13101
07:53:56,620 --> 07:53:58,340
Well, I was in the process of doing it.

13102
07:53:58,420 --> 07:53:58,760
Hold on.

13103
07:54:00,080 --> 07:54:00,480
Thanks.

13104
07:54:01,100 --> 07:54:01,720
There we go.

13105
07:54:02,540 --> 07:54:04,800
They actually do work if you...

13106
07:54:04,800 --> 07:54:07,460
You know, not use it as a staircase.

13107
07:54:08,220 --> 07:54:08,940
It's a staircase.

13108
07:54:09,440 --> 07:54:10,700
It's not a staircase.

13109
07:54:11,360 --> 07:54:13,800
There was one block that I couldn't go up from.

13110
07:54:13,800 --> 07:54:16,400
Hey, we wouldn't have found this thing if it wasn't for me.

13111
07:54:16,500 --> 07:54:17,640
Okay, so, you know...

13112
07:54:18,180 --> 07:54:19,160
Cut me some slack.

13113
07:54:23,830 --> 07:54:24,970
Oh, I hear a ghast.

13114
07:54:25,570 --> 07:54:26,310
I'm scared.

13115
07:54:28,010 --> 07:54:31,330
We just have to get to an area...

13116
07:54:31,330 --> 07:54:31,990
Oh, shit.

13117
07:54:32,230 --> 07:54:33,070
Hide, hide, hide.

13118
07:54:33,490 --> 07:54:34,130
Is that the ghast?

13119
07:54:34,850 --> 07:54:35,590
Yes, yes.

13120
07:54:36,710 --> 07:54:38,130
And you have no arrows?

13121
07:54:38,250 --> 07:54:38,930
I have no arrows.

13122
07:54:38,950 --> 07:54:39,770
I have no arrows.

13123
07:54:39,970 --> 07:54:41,330
I have two bones.

13124
07:54:42,310 --> 07:54:42,950
Oh, shit.

13125
07:54:44,310 --> 07:54:46,230
We gotta go through the forest.

13126
07:54:47,090 --> 07:54:47,770
That's okay.

13127
07:54:48,050 --> 07:54:48,970
The forest is fine.

13128
07:54:49,210 --> 07:54:49,590
It's just Enderman.

13129
07:54:49,590 --> 07:54:50,950
We gotta...

13130
07:54:50,950 --> 07:54:53,790
We gotta do it.

13131
07:54:54,290 --> 07:54:55,370
I have one arrow?

13132
07:54:55,730 --> 07:54:56,750
Oh, I do have an arrow!

13133
07:54:56,890 --> 07:54:58,250
Yeah, but this takes two arrows.

13134
07:54:58,430 --> 07:54:59,870
It takes two arrows to kill him.

13135
07:55:00,550 --> 07:55:01,170
Oh, yeah.

13136
07:55:05,220 --> 07:55:06,180
Okay, um...

13137
07:55:06,180 --> 07:55:07,340
How can we get over there?

13138
07:55:07,400 --> 07:55:08,620
There's so many Endermen.

13139
07:55:09,140 --> 07:55:10,340
Watch out for blazes.

13140
07:55:10,340 --> 07:55:10,660
The blazes...

13141
07:55:11,220 --> 07:55:13,160
The blazes are really far.

13142
07:55:14,480 --> 07:55:16,340
They shoot from everywhere.

13143
07:55:16,540 --> 07:55:17,000
It's crazy.

13144
07:55:18,040 --> 07:55:20,460
Is the ghast still there?

13145
07:55:21,500 --> 07:55:22,540
I don't see him.

13146
07:55:23,000 --> 07:55:23,660
Can we do it?

13147
07:55:23,880 --> 07:55:24,880
Did he despawn?

13148
07:55:25,840 --> 07:55:26,160
Maybe.

13149
07:55:28,180 --> 07:55:29,240
I don't see him.

13150
07:55:29,460 --> 07:55:30,020
Oh, shit!

13151
07:55:31,320 --> 07:55:34,220
Um, I'm in trouble.

13152
07:55:35,120 --> 07:55:35,920
I'm in trouble.

13153
07:55:36,060 --> 07:55:36,480
I'm in trouble.

13154
07:55:36,480 --> 07:55:36,960
I'm in trouble.

13155
07:55:39,060 --> 07:55:40,340
Make a wall.

13156
07:55:40,460 --> 07:55:40,880
Make a wall.

13157
07:55:42,280 --> 07:55:44,480
I'm making a wall, Maya, too.

13158
07:55:44,660 --> 07:55:45,340
Make a wall.

13159
07:55:47,200 --> 07:55:48,400
Make a wall.

13160
07:55:48,500 --> 07:55:49,920
Keep making walls.

13161
07:55:50,060 --> 07:55:51,000
I'm a little stuck.

13162
07:55:51,320 --> 07:55:52,700
Keep making walls.

13163
07:55:54,620 --> 07:55:56,460
I'm making walls for us.

13164
07:55:57,940 --> 07:55:58,660
You head here.

13165
07:55:59,500 --> 07:56:00,080
Where are you?

13166
07:56:00,620 --> 07:56:01,240
Oh, I see you.

13167
07:56:03,680 --> 07:56:04,640
Flying higher.

13168
07:56:04,640 --> 07:56:06,260
They're flying higher.

13169
07:56:08,760 --> 07:56:09,440
Okay.

13170
07:56:10,200 --> 07:56:11,420
I've made a wall.

13171
07:56:12,320 --> 07:56:14,040
Come down here when you can.

13172
07:56:14,540 --> 07:56:15,420
Come down?

13173
07:56:16,160 --> 07:56:18,320
Yeah, we have to get to the forest.

13174
07:56:20,180 --> 07:56:21,520
We have to get down.

13175
07:56:24,220 --> 07:56:26,040
Why are you shooting?

13176
07:56:26,220 --> 07:56:27,220
Who can you even see?

13177
07:56:27,420 --> 07:56:27,820
Me!

13178
07:56:28,880 --> 07:56:29,920
That's who!

13179
07:56:30,260 --> 07:56:30,600
Me!

13180
07:56:34,840 --> 07:56:37,180
Who can you even see?

13181
07:56:37,380 --> 07:56:39,320
I'm literally behind you!

13182
07:56:39,700 --> 07:56:40,180
Hold on!

13183
07:56:40,300 --> 07:56:40,980
I thought you were...

13184
07:56:40,980 --> 07:56:42,000
I thought you were...

13185
07:56:42,000 --> 07:56:43,000
I thought you were covered.

13186
07:56:44,360 --> 07:56:47,880
Okay, I'm almost really out of everything that I have.

13187
07:56:47,900 --> 07:56:48,680
I'm thinking...

13188
07:56:48,680 --> 07:56:50,200
I'm stealing stuff I had.

13189
07:56:53,460 --> 07:56:54,560
Oh, don't look.

13190
07:56:54,640 --> 07:56:55,500
Don't look at them.

13191
07:56:55,600 --> 07:56:57,800
Don't look at them, because we ran out of stone.

13192
07:56:57,940 --> 07:56:59,380
We ran out of stone, so don't look at them.

13193
07:56:59,380 --> 07:57:00,520
No, I still have a little bit of stone.

13194
07:57:00,520 --> 07:57:01,340
I still have a little bit of stone.

13195
07:57:01,640 --> 07:57:04,500
Yes, but the Endermen are right below us.

13196
07:57:04,800 --> 07:57:07,100
The Endermen are right below us, so don't look at them.

13197
07:57:09,340 --> 07:57:09,980
Oh, shit.

13198
07:57:10,540 --> 07:57:11,460
Here you go.

13199
07:57:11,540 --> 07:57:12,420
We're not safe.

13200
07:57:13,240 --> 07:57:16,420
Thank you, but we're not safe from the blazes.

13201
07:57:16,820 --> 07:57:17,480
Oh, no.

13202
07:57:20,980 --> 07:57:22,480
Please despawn blazes!

13203
07:57:23,220 --> 07:57:23,740
How are we supposed to...

13204
07:57:24,780 --> 07:57:25,700
Oh, gosh.

13205
07:57:26,820 --> 07:57:28,740
I think we might have to like...

13206
07:57:28,740 --> 07:57:31,940
Jump and just run into the forest.

13207
07:57:32,060 --> 07:57:32,760
Okay, let's do it.

13208
07:57:32,980 --> 07:57:34,020
And then dig into the wall.

13209
07:57:34,160 --> 07:57:34,420
Okay.

13210
07:57:35,900 --> 07:57:37,060
This is how we die.

13211
07:57:38,480 --> 07:57:39,520
Wait, have your pickaxe?

13212
07:57:39,580 --> 07:57:40,380
Well, I have mine ready.

13213
07:57:40,940 --> 07:57:42,380
Have your everything ready?

13214
07:57:42,680 --> 07:57:43,420
Okay, I'm gonna eat real quick.

13215
07:57:43,420 --> 07:57:45,200
Sword or pickaxe?

13216
07:57:47,340 --> 07:57:48,060
Pickaxe, probably.

13217
07:57:48,640 --> 07:57:49,600
Who are we fighting?

13218
07:57:50,240 --> 07:57:50,960
The Endermen?

13219
07:57:51,020 --> 07:57:53,080
I don't know, what if we accidentally look at them?

13220
07:57:53,660 --> 07:57:54,200
Okay, true.

13221
07:57:54,660 --> 07:57:55,440
Alright, I'm gonna go down.

13222
07:57:55,440 --> 07:57:56,600
Okay, we're safe.

13223
07:57:57,220 --> 07:57:57,560
For now.

13224
07:57:57,860 --> 07:57:58,380
Alright, let's go.

13225
07:57:59,860 --> 07:58:00,560
Just run.

13226
07:58:01,160 --> 07:58:01,460
Just run.

13227
07:58:02,860 --> 07:58:04,740
Be careful here, there's a huge hole.

13228
07:58:05,000 --> 07:58:05,940
There's a huge hole right here.

13229
07:58:06,700 --> 07:58:07,300
Just run.

13230
07:58:09,240 --> 07:58:09,640
Just run.

13231
07:58:10,440 --> 07:58:12,180
What if the Enderman slaps you?

13232
07:58:12,260 --> 07:58:13,140
What if he slaps you?

13233
07:58:13,200 --> 07:58:13,600
Just run!

13234
07:58:17,340 --> 07:58:19,100
Okay, I think we're safe from the blazes though.

13235
07:58:19,360 --> 07:58:19,520
Okay.

13236
07:58:24,880 --> 07:58:26,820
Oh my god!

13237
07:58:29,960 --> 07:58:31,920
We gotta find the pigs.

13238
07:58:32,280 --> 07:58:33,660
We gotta get back to pigs.

13239
07:58:33,820 --> 07:58:36,440
We gotta get back to the...

13240
07:58:36,440 --> 07:58:38,860
Wait, the red area is where we came from.

13241
07:58:39,300 --> 07:58:39,920
Oh shoot.

13242
07:58:40,160 --> 07:58:43,760
The ghast blocked us, so we can't...

13243
07:58:43,760 --> 07:58:45,440
We gotta find our own red area.

13244
07:58:46,300 --> 07:58:47,720
Let's just dig through here...

13245
07:58:47,720 --> 07:58:48,720
and we can dig to the right...

13246
07:58:48,720 --> 07:58:50,400
and we might make it back into that area.

13247
07:58:53,280 --> 07:58:57,120
It took us three hours to find a fortress.

13248
07:59:00,710 --> 07:59:03,330
Oh, thank you.

13249
07:59:04,650 --> 07:59:05,390
I thought...

13250
07:59:05,390 --> 07:59:07,950
For a second there, I was about to be like, wait, you didn't just dig...

13251
07:59:07,950 --> 07:59:09,090
and get lava?

13252
07:59:11,250 --> 07:59:14,070
This is good though, we're replenishing our...

13253
07:59:14,070 --> 07:59:16,330
That's good, we're replenishing our...

13254
07:59:16,330 --> 07:59:18,810
Our rock stuff.

13255
07:59:18,890 --> 07:59:19,530
Are you digging?

13256
07:59:19,810 --> 07:59:22,150
No, there's like literally holes underneath you.

13257
07:59:22,790 --> 07:59:24,670
There's holes underneath you.

13258
07:59:25,250 --> 07:59:26,470
Alright, I'm gonna dig here.

13259
07:59:26,650 --> 07:59:27,230
Watch out, watch out.

13260
07:59:28,650 --> 07:59:28,970
Okay.

13261
07:59:30,910 --> 07:59:32,290
I believe in you.

13262
07:59:33,270 --> 07:59:35,730
I won't dig to the side, because...

13263
07:59:35,730 --> 07:59:36,570
Yeah, don't dig.

13264
07:59:36,570 --> 07:59:37,510
What if there's lava?

13265
07:59:39,010 --> 07:59:40,070
Just let me dig.

13266
07:59:40,770 --> 07:59:42,050
I'll dig us out of here.

13267
07:59:42,470 --> 07:59:43,890
And we'll go to the red, hopefully.

13268
07:59:43,890 --> 07:59:45,730
I'm gonna make some bread.

13269
07:59:46,650 --> 07:59:47,810
And then we just...

13270
07:59:47,810 --> 07:59:49,770
Then we will be out, oh my gosh.

13271
07:59:50,230 --> 07:59:51,650
Imagine, we'll see sunlight.

13272
07:59:51,890 --> 07:59:54,410
Oh my God, and then we never have to go there again.

13273
07:59:55,590 --> 07:59:56,670
No, don't say that.

13274
07:59:56,790 --> 07:59:57,830
Don't say that.

13275
07:59:59,610 --> 08:00:01,290
We'll never have to go there again.

13276
08:00:01,290 --> 08:00:03,450
If we have the worst luck ever...

13277
08:00:03,450 --> 08:00:04,970
If we have the worst luck ever...

13278
08:00:04,970 --> 08:00:06,710
We'll never have to go there again.

13279
08:00:10,810 --> 08:00:11,470
Unless...

13280
08:00:11,470 --> 08:00:12,550
Oh, it's okay.

13281
08:00:12,770 --> 08:00:13,950
I have my...

13282
08:00:15,210 --> 08:00:15,870
Unless...

13283
08:00:17,270 --> 08:00:17,930
Unless...

13284
08:00:19,210 --> 08:00:19,870
Unless...

13285
08:00:19,870 --> 08:00:22,690
It'll be so funny if something just happens.

13286
08:00:23,290 --> 08:00:26,450
I bet Chat is feeling so much more...

13287
08:00:26,450 --> 08:00:28,330
Like, confident in us now.

13288
08:00:28,330 --> 08:00:29,650
Wait, we have to make arrows.

13289
08:00:30,530 --> 08:00:32,790
We can make arrows with...

13290
08:00:32,790 --> 08:00:34,010
With regular materials.

13291
08:00:34,010 --> 08:00:35,530
Yeah, but we need...

13292
08:00:35,530 --> 08:00:36,050
What do we need?

13293
08:00:36,110 --> 08:00:36,650
Do we need...

13294
08:00:36,650 --> 08:00:37,750
We don't have string.

13295
08:00:39,190 --> 08:00:41,390
Wait, don't you need string for arrows?

13296
08:00:41,830 --> 08:00:43,070
I have 32 string.

13297
08:00:43,230 --> 08:00:44,070
Oh, okay, we're fine.

13298
08:00:47,450 --> 08:00:48,250
We're fine.

13299
08:00:48,650 --> 08:00:50,430
And then we can create lots of beds.

13300
08:00:51,270 --> 08:00:52,610
Yeah, we can do the bed strut.

13301
08:00:53,210 --> 08:00:54,830
Flint, stick, and feather.

13302
08:00:55,090 --> 08:00:56,410
Yeah, we don't even need string.

13303
08:00:56,610 --> 08:00:58,490
We need strings for bows, but...

13304
08:00:59,110 --> 08:01:00,330
Oh, watch out, watch out, watch out!

13305
08:01:00,950 --> 08:01:02,750
I'm literally 20 feet away from you.

13306
08:01:02,750 --> 08:01:02,810
Oh.

13307
08:01:05,150 --> 08:01:06,710
Of course you are.

13308
08:01:07,230 --> 08:01:11,830
What do you mean, of course you are?

13309
08:01:12,010 --> 08:01:13,550
You're taking...

13310
08:01:13,550 --> 08:01:15,230
You're taking lava!

13311
08:01:20,830 --> 08:01:21,730
Are you okay?

13312
08:01:21,990 --> 08:01:23,110
I'm taking sippy.

13313
08:01:23,950 --> 08:01:25,110
What the hell was that?

13314
08:01:25,470 --> 08:01:26,390
I don't fucking know.

13315
08:01:27,470 --> 08:01:28,910
Oh, that's the Enderman to your left.

13316
08:01:29,730 --> 08:01:31,330
No, but, like, something screamed.

13317
08:01:35,270 --> 08:01:35,830
Enderman...

13318
08:01:35,830 --> 08:01:36,050
Oops!

13319
08:01:37,790 --> 08:01:39,090
What is that?

13320
08:01:39,590 --> 08:01:40,550
I don't hear anything.

13321
08:01:41,670 --> 08:01:43,250
That has to be a gas, right?

13322
08:01:45,070 --> 08:01:47,470
It's not showing up on my thing as a gas.

13323
08:01:48,350 --> 08:01:49,590
I have no idea.

13324
08:01:50,190 --> 08:01:51,970
I don't know what that was.

13325
08:01:52,010 --> 08:01:52,590
That was weird.

13326
08:01:52,650 --> 08:01:53,450
I didn't hear it.

13327
08:01:54,330 --> 08:01:55,590
How long is this mountain?

13328
08:01:56,410 --> 08:01:58,050
Oh, uh, I spoke too soon.

13329
08:01:59,330 --> 08:02:00,770
We're still in the...

13330
08:02:00,770 --> 08:02:01,310
Oh my god.

13331
08:02:02,310 --> 08:02:02,810
Um...

13332
08:02:02,810 --> 08:02:05,330
I don't like that sound that you just heard.

13333
08:02:05,410 --> 08:02:07,410
Because we ran out of bows and arrows.

13334
08:02:08,330 --> 08:02:08,730
Yeah.

13335
08:02:09,070 --> 08:02:11,130
We have to, um, not...

13336
08:02:11,130 --> 08:02:12,550
encounter that guy.

13337
08:02:13,830 --> 08:02:15,610
Uh, we're, like, deep in the forest.

13338
08:02:15,690 --> 08:02:17,390
I think, um...

13339
08:02:17,390 --> 08:02:18,710
I think this didn't work.

13340
08:02:19,410 --> 08:02:21,050
I think this...

13341
08:02:21,050 --> 08:02:23,750
I think the red area is to our right.

13342
08:02:24,890 --> 08:02:26,450
I think it's...

13343
08:02:26,450 --> 08:02:27,090
To the right?

13344
08:02:27,350 --> 08:02:27,630
Yeah.

13345
08:02:27,630 --> 08:02:28,110
Wanna dig?

13346
08:02:39,760 --> 08:02:40,980
Follow the cords.

13347
08:02:41,100 --> 08:02:41,620
What cords?

13348
08:02:41,720 --> 08:02:42,620
We didn't take cords.

13349
08:02:44,180 --> 08:02:46,320
The coordinates back to our original...

13350
08:02:46,320 --> 08:02:48,900
Our very first portal.

13351
08:02:49,260 --> 08:02:52,020
The one that's a hundred miles away from us.

13352
08:02:52,860 --> 08:02:53,500
Is it this?

13353
08:02:53,540 --> 08:02:55,480
A little tiny spot right here?

13354
08:02:56,120 --> 08:02:59,140
Oh, I guess we were really close to the, um...

13355
08:02:59,960 --> 08:03:00,820
Oh, hello.

13356
08:03:01,320 --> 08:03:05,120
We were really close to the, uh...

13357
08:03:05,120 --> 08:03:06,940
That big forest that we came from.

13358
08:03:07,500 --> 08:03:08,240
Yeah, that's what I was saying.

13359
08:03:08,340 --> 08:03:11,620
We were really close to a forest when we got to just a little...

13360
08:03:11,620 --> 08:03:11,820
Yeah.

13361
08:03:12,100 --> 08:03:12,820
Regular guy area.

13362
08:03:13,080 --> 08:03:15,320
Wait, what was our coordinates for our original place?

13363
08:03:16,260 --> 08:03:16,940
Original portal.

13364
08:03:17,660 --> 08:03:18,640
Yeah, yeah, original portal.

13365
08:03:19,380 --> 08:03:20,300
Uh, hold on.

13366
08:03:20,320 --> 08:03:21,640
I wanna see how far we are from it.

13367
08:03:21,640 --> 08:03:22,500
Wait, there's a piglin!

13368
08:03:23,600 --> 08:03:24,400
Piglin snorting?

13369
08:03:24,680 --> 08:03:25,160
Where at?

13370
08:03:25,320 --> 08:03:26,640
Where are you, piglin snorting?

13371
08:03:28,180 --> 08:03:29,080
Can we go up?

13372
08:03:29,720 --> 08:03:30,800
He might be above us.

13373
08:03:31,100 --> 08:03:31,940
Yeah, I think he is.

13374
08:03:32,080 --> 08:03:33,120
You have all the...

13375
08:03:33,120 --> 08:03:34,320
I added all the netherite, right?

13376
08:03:34,400 --> 08:03:36,580
So I don't have what it...

13377
08:03:36,580 --> 08:03:37,340
Oh, uh...

13378
08:03:37,340 --> 08:03:38,280
He's behind us.

13379
08:03:38,400 --> 08:03:38,980
He's behind us.

13380
08:03:39,880 --> 08:03:40,820
Who's behind...

13381
08:03:40,820 --> 08:03:41,340
Oh, hello.

13382
08:03:41,660 --> 08:03:42,060
Oh my god.

13383
08:03:42,260 --> 08:03:44,220
Yeah, he's behind us.

13384
08:03:44,220 --> 08:03:46,820
Let me get the cords from the original one.

13385
08:03:48,880 --> 08:03:50,260
Oh, okay.

13386
08:03:50,500 --> 08:03:51,200
Let me check.

13387
08:03:51,680 --> 08:03:52,020
Alright.

13388
08:03:52,420 --> 08:03:53,000
Are you ready?

13389
08:03:53,380 --> 08:03:53,660
Yeah.

13390
08:03:54,180 --> 08:03:54,880
What is it?

13391
08:03:57,440 --> 08:03:58,000
Um...

13392
08:03:58,000 --> 08:04:01,220
Are the... It's negative two thousand...

13393
08:04:01,220 --> 08:04:01,760
Oh, sorry, no.

13394
08:04:01,860 --> 08:04:05,120
Negative five hundred and five...

13395
08:04:06,120 --> 08:04:06,560
Uh...

13396
08:04:07,200 --> 08:04:07,420
195.

13397
08:04:08,020 --> 08:04:09,300
We're not making it back.

13398
08:04:09,640 --> 08:04:10,620
You wanna know what we are?

13399
08:04:10,800 --> 08:04:11,580
You don't...

13400
08:04:11,580 --> 08:04:12,940
Oh, I'm looking at what we are.

13401
08:04:12,940 --> 08:04:13,820
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

13402
08:04:17,400 --> 08:04:19,040
Wait, we're not getting back there.

13403
08:04:19,260 --> 08:04:20,060
We gotta say goodbye.

13404
08:04:20,960 --> 08:04:23,000
Oh, we traveled that far?

13405
08:04:23,160 --> 08:04:25,260
Say goodbye to that lapis block.

13406
08:04:25,460 --> 08:04:27,260
Say goodbye to that lapis block.

13407
08:04:27,480 --> 08:04:28,460
I see a ghast.

13408
08:04:28,480 --> 08:04:30,180
I see a ghast floating over there.

13409
08:04:30,300 --> 08:04:31,120
Oh gosh, okay.

13410
08:04:31,720 --> 08:04:32,980
I guess we build up.

13411
08:04:33,400 --> 08:04:34,900
We gotta just build up.

13412
08:04:38,250 --> 08:04:39,210
We traveled.

13413
08:04:40,290 --> 08:04:41,490
Why isn't mine...

13414
08:04:41,490 --> 08:04:42,350
This is why the...

13415
08:04:42,350 --> 08:04:45,110
This is why the earth isn't round.

13416
08:04:45,750 --> 08:04:48,270
Because in Minecraft, it's clearly flat.

13417
08:04:49,230 --> 08:04:50,150
Oh my god, please.

13418
08:04:51,970 --> 08:04:52,590
Do you hear him?

13419
08:04:52,670 --> 08:04:53,270
Yes, I do.

13420
08:04:53,310 --> 08:04:55,050
I'm trying to not look behind me.

13421
08:04:56,310 --> 08:04:58,970
If you come up here, there's like a safe little area.

13422
08:04:58,970 --> 08:05:01,810
Oh wait, we're in the mushroom area again.

13423
08:05:01,830 --> 08:05:02,270
I know.

13424
08:05:02,430 --> 08:05:02,790
I know.

13425
08:05:02,950 --> 08:05:03,230
I know.

13426
08:05:03,590 --> 08:05:04,230
But come up here.

13427
08:05:04,310 --> 08:05:04,690
Come up here.

13428
08:05:04,770 --> 08:05:05,850
Where is here?

13429
08:05:06,030 --> 08:05:06,950
Where is here?

13430
08:05:07,050 --> 08:05:07,650
Where did you go?

13431
08:05:07,790 --> 08:05:08,670
I don't know.

13432
08:05:08,890 --> 08:05:10,650
I don't know anymore.

13433
08:05:11,450 --> 08:05:12,190
Oh, there you are.

13434
08:05:12,250 --> 08:05:13,430
Hey, I'm here.

13435
08:05:13,790 --> 08:05:14,450
Where are you?

13436
08:05:14,730 --> 08:05:16,050
Doki is a flat earth.

13437
08:05:19,750 --> 08:05:20,630
Where are you?

13438
08:05:21,230 --> 08:05:21,950
Turn around.

13439
08:05:22,530 --> 08:05:23,050
Oh, hello.

13440
08:05:23,290 --> 08:05:23,670
Oh, okay.

13441
08:05:24,230 --> 08:05:26,130
I was gonna say in here is a safe little area.

13442
08:05:26,130 --> 08:05:29,110
Oh my gosh, what if we just set up shop?

13443
08:05:29,450 --> 08:05:30,790
What if we just lived here forever?

13444
08:05:31,010 --> 08:05:31,910
This is where we live.

13445
08:05:32,030 --> 08:05:33,070
We're just never gonna end stream.

13446
08:05:33,190 --> 08:05:35,730
We're just gonna be here like domestic life right here.

13447
08:05:37,850 --> 08:05:38,250
Domestic.

13448
08:05:38,490 --> 08:05:40,050
Wait, the red is in front of us.

13449
08:05:40,090 --> 08:05:41,370
It's literally in front of us.

13450
08:05:43,230 --> 08:05:43,890
It is?

13451
08:05:46,650 --> 08:05:47,630
Oh yeah, you're right.

13452
08:05:47,750 --> 08:05:48,410
It is right there.

13453
08:05:48,510 --> 08:05:49,190
Okay, thank goodness.

13454
08:05:50,450 --> 08:05:50,750
Okay.

13455
08:05:51,330 --> 08:05:53,150
We are putting all our...

13456
08:05:53,150 --> 08:05:55,630
all our gotcha luck into this right now.

13457
08:05:56,970 --> 08:05:57,850
But, oh...

13458
08:05:57,850 --> 08:05:59,210
Wait, how many pearls do we have?

13459
08:05:59,270 --> 08:06:00,470
Do we have enough enderpearls?

13460
08:06:00,530 --> 08:06:02,730
We have to get back there.

13461
08:06:02,790 --> 08:06:05,130
We have to get back there because all their enderpearls are there.

13462
08:06:06,290 --> 08:06:08,030
Oh my god, are you serious?

13463
08:06:08,470 --> 08:06:09,610
All their enderpearls are there.

13464
08:06:09,690 --> 08:06:10,790
I didn't bring them.

13465
08:06:11,110 --> 08:06:13,470
I didn't bring the enderpearls.

13466
08:06:13,610 --> 08:06:15,370
I left them all there.

13467
08:06:16,110 --> 08:06:17,030
We have to...

13468
08:06:17,030 --> 08:06:20,530
When we get out of here, we have to find our area.

13469
08:06:21,150 --> 08:06:23,030
We have to travel.

13470
08:06:24,310 --> 08:06:25,270
Okay, well...

13471
08:06:25,270 --> 08:06:26,670
What if we don't do that?

13472
08:06:26,790 --> 08:06:28,950
And we just farm enderpearls right here.

13473
08:06:29,850 --> 08:06:30,970
I mean, you...

13474
08:06:30,970 --> 08:06:33,310
I'm gonna find a piglet and trade.

13475
08:06:33,710 --> 08:06:34,750
Oh yeah, keep trading.

13476
08:06:35,030 --> 08:06:35,990
We gotta get the...

13477
08:06:35,990 --> 08:06:37,270
We gotta get the...

13478
08:06:39,110 --> 08:06:42,510
I put it there because I thought we'd come back.

13479
08:06:42,670 --> 08:06:43,650
I thought we'd come back.

13480
08:06:43,650 --> 08:06:45,830
How far did you think we were gonna...

13481
08:06:45,830 --> 08:06:45,970
I thought we'd come back.

13482
08:06:45,970 --> 08:06:47,890
You thought we were just gonna go for a little walk.

13483
08:06:48,310 --> 08:06:50,890
Like, just a little...

13484
08:06:50,890 --> 08:06:54,410
I didn't think we'd ever come back.

13485
08:06:54,490 --> 08:06:56,850
I didn't think we'd ever come back.

13486
08:06:57,030 --> 08:06:59,550
I thought we'd come back.

13487
08:06:59,670 --> 08:07:00,770
I really did.

13488
08:07:01,230 --> 08:07:01,970
I thought...

13489
08:07:01,970 --> 08:07:06,150
I thought we were just gonna travel there for a little bit.

13490
08:07:06,190 --> 08:07:07,210
And then we'd come back.

13491
08:07:07,450 --> 08:07:09,130
There's one more over there.

13492
08:07:09,150 --> 08:07:09,530
Alright.

13493
08:07:10,770 --> 08:07:11,930
Oh, he's looking at you.

13494
08:07:12,030 --> 08:07:12,190
Okay.

13495
08:07:12,290 --> 08:07:12,930
Yeah, I got him.

13496
08:07:13,690 --> 08:07:14,910
Yeah, you keep trading.

13497
08:07:20,910 --> 08:07:22,410
I'm carrying the brewing stand.

13498
08:07:22,510 --> 08:07:23,450
I have the brewing stand.

13499
08:07:25,230 --> 08:07:26,410
I have the brewing stand, guys.

13500
08:07:26,890 --> 08:07:27,110
Don't worry.

13501
08:07:28,750 --> 08:07:29,890
I have the brewing stand.

13502
08:07:30,470 --> 08:07:31,350
I brought it with me.

13503
08:07:32,090 --> 08:07:33,370
I thought I had.

13504
08:07:35,830 --> 08:07:37,110
Is that also black stone?

13505
08:07:38,050 --> 08:07:38,330
Wait.

13506
08:07:38,670 --> 08:07:39,750
It gives you obsidian.

13507
08:07:39,890 --> 08:07:40,230
Let me know.

13508
08:07:40,610 --> 08:07:41,230
I'll take it.

13509
08:07:41,410 --> 08:07:43,890
He keeps giving me corrupted obsidian.

13510
08:07:45,290 --> 08:07:45,730
What?

13511
08:07:45,870 --> 08:07:50,050
What if you went above ground and traveled 20,000 blocks back to the portal in the overworld?

13512
08:07:51,510 --> 08:07:53,330
Well, that's where our stuff is.

13513
08:07:53,430 --> 08:07:53,610
Wait.

13514
08:07:54,570 --> 08:07:55,910
That's where we...

13515
08:07:55,910 --> 08:07:56,970
That's what we did.

13516
08:07:57,790 --> 08:07:58,790
Wait, I'm confused.

13517
08:08:00,030 --> 08:08:00,750
Oh no.

13518
08:08:02,590 --> 08:08:03,670
Above ground?

13519
08:08:05,630 --> 08:08:07,230
It's like the world limit.

13520
08:08:09,910 --> 08:08:10,990
Oh, like...

13521
08:08:13,610 --> 08:08:16,270
It's like you can go all the way up...

13522
08:08:16,270 --> 08:08:16,950
for the world limit.

13523
08:08:16,970 --> 08:08:18,890
Like the world limit thing.

13524
08:08:18,890 --> 08:08:19,930
Like, wait.

13525
08:08:20,050 --> 08:08:22,150
Create a new portal and travel in the normal world.

13526
08:08:22,250 --> 08:08:23,990
That's what we're trying to do right now.

13527
08:08:24,110 --> 08:08:25,230
That's what we're trying to do.

13528
08:08:25,450 --> 08:08:26,710
We're trying to figure it out.

13529
08:08:26,970 --> 08:08:27,930
We're trying to do that.

13530
08:08:29,050 --> 08:08:30,670
But we just don't have obsidian.

13531
08:08:31,250 --> 08:08:33,750
We just don't have obsidian.

13532
08:08:34,590 --> 08:08:36,130
Yeah, we're trying to collect the obsidian.

13533
08:08:38,970 --> 08:08:40,790
I'm also just farming blocks.

13534
08:08:41,370 --> 08:08:42,190
I mean pearls.

13535
08:08:43,410 --> 08:08:44,550
Oh my god.

13536
08:08:44,590 --> 08:08:47,130
My gacha luck is not doing so well.

13537
08:08:47,130 --> 08:08:50,650
Man, my gacha luck isn't doing so well.

13538
08:08:50,770 --> 08:08:52,590
I've got everything but...

13539
08:08:52,590 --> 08:08:53,310
I have leather.

13540
08:08:53,610 --> 08:08:54,450
I have leather.

13541
08:08:54,910 --> 08:08:55,530
Wow.

13542
08:08:57,530 --> 08:08:58,490
Is that it?

13543
08:08:59,010 --> 08:09:00,210
Oh, I have one obsidian.

13544
08:09:00,410 --> 08:09:02,570
I got one obsidian.

13545
08:09:03,250 --> 08:09:04,470
We have five obsidian.

13546
08:09:05,710 --> 08:09:06,850
Okay, I can make...

13547
08:09:06,850 --> 08:09:08,570
I can make another...

13548
08:09:08,570 --> 08:09:09,890
I can make more gold.

13549
08:09:13,240 --> 08:09:13,520
Enderman.

13550
08:09:14,120 --> 08:09:15,660
I have five more gold.

13551
08:09:15,660 --> 08:09:18,220
I'm coming for you, Enderman.

13552
08:09:20,480 --> 08:09:23,660
Show me your sweet, sweet slender body.

13553
08:09:23,900 --> 08:09:27,000
Oh, come on.

13554
08:09:27,060 --> 08:09:27,640
Look at this.

13555
08:09:27,700 --> 08:09:29,660
Look at this juicy gold.

13556
08:09:32,540 --> 08:09:33,780
How much gold do you have?

13557
08:09:35,180 --> 08:09:36,160
I have...

13558
08:09:36,160 --> 08:09:37,080
Here, take my axe.

13559
08:09:37,260 --> 08:09:38,280
I don't need it anymore.

13560
08:09:38,560 --> 08:09:40,660
Take my axe.

13561
08:09:40,800 --> 08:09:41,940
I don't even want it.

13562
08:09:43,220 --> 08:09:43,740
Okay.

13563
08:09:44,260 --> 08:09:45,600
Come on, take it.

13564
08:09:47,860 --> 08:09:48,380
Okay.

13565
08:09:51,740 --> 08:09:52,660
I heard a ghastly.

13566
08:09:52,760 --> 08:09:53,700
I heard a ghastly.

13567
08:09:53,800 --> 08:09:54,420
I got PTSD.

13568
08:09:55,260 --> 08:09:56,180
I know, I hear him too.

13569
08:09:56,780 --> 08:10:00,020
Unless we see...

13570
08:10:00,020 --> 08:10:01,420
How many enderpearls do you have?

13571
08:10:02,000 --> 08:10:03,280
I got five resistances.

13572
08:10:03,580 --> 08:10:04,100
Okay.

13573
08:10:05,600 --> 08:10:07,860
There's no enderman around here.

13574
08:10:08,960 --> 08:10:09,240
Uh-oh.

13575
08:10:09,240 --> 08:10:10,340
He sounds close.

13576
08:10:10,520 --> 08:10:12,240
Okay, here's one.

13577
08:10:13,440 --> 08:10:14,280
Here's one what?

13578
08:10:14,580 --> 08:10:15,180
Oh, thank you.

13579
08:10:16,040 --> 08:10:17,200
I managed to get one.

13580
08:10:17,320 --> 08:10:18,580
Do you have any nuggets at all?

13581
08:10:19,860 --> 08:10:20,280
No.

13582
08:10:21,000 --> 08:10:23,240
Okay, so...

13583
08:10:23,760 --> 08:10:24,340
Yeah.

13584
08:10:24,620 --> 08:10:25,380
That's it.

13585
08:10:27,260 --> 08:10:29,160
We gotta farm more gold.

13586
08:10:29,240 --> 08:10:30,240
We gotta farm more gold.

13587
08:10:30,260 --> 08:10:32,280
We gotta find more gold.

13588
08:10:32,760 --> 08:10:34,340
There's some above us.

13589
08:10:35,240 --> 08:10:35,800
There's...

13590
08:10:38,140 --> 08:10:39,100
I'm gonna do it.

13591
08:10:39,120 --> 08:10:40,060
I'm gonna trade my axe.

13592
08:10:40,340 --> 08:10:43,240
This is the last axe off the back of my...

13593
08:10:43,240 --> 08:10:44,800
You can trade your axe?

13594
08:10:44,900 --> 08:10:46,400
Yeah, you can trade gold items.

13595
08:10:46,660 --> 08:10:48,000
Where is the...

13596
08:10:48,000 --> 08:10:50,940
Sir, sir, this is all I have, sir.

13597
08:10:51,400 --> 08:10:52,480
This is...

13598
08:10:52,480 --> 08:10:53,700
Please take...

13599
08:10:53,700 --> 08:10:55,440
This is all I have.

13600
08:10:56,440 --> 08:10:58,760
Hold on, we gotta look around for some gold.

13601
08:10:58,900 --> 08:11:00,680
I don't have any more.

13602
08:11:00,920 --> 08:11:03,480
This is everything I have.

13603
08:11:04,340 --> 08:11:05,300
What did he give me?

13604
08:11:06,980 --> 08:11:08,320
I don't know what he took...

13605
08:11:08,320 --> 08:11:09,320
What he gave me.

13606
08:11:10,760 --> 08:11:12,700
But what did he take from you?

13607
08:11:12,960 --> 08:11:14,640
What did he even give me?

13608
08:11:14,980 --> 08:11:16,340
He gave me nothing?!

13609
08:11:18,220 --> 08:11:20,760
Ah, he just puts it in his inventory?!

13610
08:11:20,760 --> 08:11:24,840
No, I'm afraid of trading my helmet.

13611
08:11:24,980 --> 08:11:25,480
Wait, wait.

13612
08:11:25,780 --> 08:11:27,360
My armor has way more...

13613
08:11:27,360 --> 08:11:29,540
My body...

13614
08:11:29,540 --> 08:11:31,280
Only don't give stuff for gold.

13615
08:11:31,280 --> 08:11:33,300
I got one guide!

13616
08:11:34,360 --> 08:11:34,860
Somebody...

13617
08:11:34,860 --> 08:11:36,840
Don't give him your stuff.

13618
08:11:37,040 --> 08:11:38,880
I got one guide.

13619
08:11:40,160 --> 08:11:41,360
Hold on, hold on.

13620
08:11:41,720 --> 08:11:42,600
I found some gold.

13621
08:11:42,980 --> 08:11:45,660
Hold on, I gotta create a little barrier for it.

13622
08:11:45,660 --> 08:11:46,820
So it doesn't fall into the...

13623
08:11:46,820 --> 08:11:47,900
Into the world.

13624
08:11:49,080 --> 08:11:51,220
He looked at me and just took it.

13625
08:11:51,280 --> 08:11:52,140
He just took it!

13626
08:11:56,800 --> 08:11:58,920
He just took it from me.

13627
08:11:58,920 --> 08:12:00,940
It was the last thing I own.

13628
08:12:01,840 --> 08:12:03,920
It was the last thing I own.

13629
08:12:04,220 --> 08:12:05,100
Is there anyone around here?

13630
08:12:05,200 --> 08:12:05,620
I don't think so.

13631
08:12:05,660 --> 08:12:07,280
He just took it from me.

13632
08:12:08,140 --> 08:12:09,360
That's so cruel.

13633
08:12:11,760 --> 08:12:12,660
Wait, where is it?

13634
08:12:12,900 --> 08:12:19,080
Oh, here we go.

13635
08:12:19,340 --> 08:12:20,060
Okay, now we're good.

13636
08:12:23,100 --> 08:12:25,700
I can't believe he just took it like that.

13637
08:12:26,280 --> 08:12:26,760
Really?

13638
08:12:26,880 --> 08:12:27,680
You can't believe it?

13639
08:12:27,680 --> 08:12:28,840
I can't believe it.

13640
08:12:28,880 --> 08:12:30,300
I feel like I just got robbed.

13641
08:12:31,980 --> 08:12:32,880
Dragoon did...

13642
08:12:33,580 --> 08:12:35,380
Dragoon did more mental damage than like...

13643
08:12:35,380 --> 08:12:36,460
I just got robbed.

13644
08:12:36,620 --> 08:12:38,520
He like looked at me and just...

13645
08:12:38,520 --> 08:12:40,100
Looked and just walked away.

13646
08:12:40,760 --> 08:12:42,980
Walked away with my golden axe.

13647
08:12:43,400 --> 08:12:44,920
I have 36 nuggies.

13648
08:12:45,700 --> 08:12:46,500
Wait, where are you?

13649
08:12:46,640 --> 08:12:47,240
Okay, I'm here.

13650
08:12:47,540 --> 08:12:48,020
I'm coming.

13651
08:12:48,360 --> 08:12:50,300
Alright, here's the crafting table.

13652
08:12:50,600 --> 08:12:52,880
I have like four on me too.

13653
08:12:54,040 --> 08:12:55,800
Oh, I saw an enderman, I think.

13654
08:12:55,800 --> 08:12:56,680
Hello?

13655
08:12:56,980 --> 08:12:57,420
There he is.

13656
08:12:57,480 --> 08:12:57,660
Okay.

13657
08:12:59,780 --> 08:13:01,440
I have four more.

13658
08:13:10,120 --> 08:13:11,080
Come on.

13659
08:13:11,280 --> 08:13:12,700
Come on, there's two of you.

13660
08:13:12,860 --> 08:13:13,780
Surely two of you.

13661
08:13:13,960 --> 08:13:15,800
Oh my god, he gave me so sad.

13662
08:13:16,200 --> 08:13:17,860
He gave me so sad.

13663
08:13:18,340 --> 08:13:19,060
Where is this?

13664
08:13:19,320 --> 08:13:20,360
Oh, I got an obsidian!

13665
08:13:21,980 --> 08:13:22,060
Nice!

13666
08:13:22,800 --> 08:13:24,020
We just need two more!

13667
08:13:24,120 --> 08:13:25,260
Two more, two more, two more!

13668
08:13:26,460 --> 08:13:27,940
I don't have gold anymore.

13669
08:13:28,040 --> 08:13:29,040
I don't have gold anymore.

13670
08:13:29,640 --> 08:13:31,140
We gotta find some more.

13671
08:13:32,000 --> 08:13:33,160
We gotta find...

13672
08:13:33,160 --> 08:13:36,280
Back into the nether mines we go.

13673
08:13:37,040 --> 08:13:38,140
The nether mines.

13674
08:13:40,020 --> 08:13:41,700
We're like really far up.

13675
08:13:41,760 --> 08:13:42,920
So it's like hard to dig.

13676
08:13:44,720 --> 08:13:45,860
Okay, I'm just gonna dig.

13677
08:13:47,220 --> 08:13:49,980
I'm looking around to see if I can...

13678
08:13:49,980 --> 08:13:50,680
Find...

13679
08:13:51,280 --> 08:13:53,460
Find stuff in the nether mines.

13680
08:13:56,140 --> 08:13:57,260
Okay, right here.

13681
08:13:57,980 --> 08:14:00,480
The nether mines to get out of this hellhole.

13682
08:14:01,740 --> 08:14:02,360
We're doing it!

13683
08:14:02,400 --> 08:14:03,080
We're doing it!

13684
08:14:03,360 --> 08:14:04,580
You found more nuggies?

13685
08:14:05,100 --> 08:14:07,520
No, but we're just, you know, we're doing something.

13686
08:14:07,840 --> 08:14:08,960
We're here.

13687
08:14:09,540 --> 08:14:10,560
I saw the enderman.

13688
08:14:13,480 --> 08:14:15,880
I'm looking around for nuggies for us.

13689
08:14:15,920 --> 08:14:17,260
I'm not gonna TNT, guys.

13690
08:14:17,300 --> 08:14:18,040
We're too high up.

13691
08:14:18,040 --> 08:14:19,040
It's too risky.

13692
08:14:19,280 --> 08:14:20,920
We can't.

13693
08:14:21,380 --> 08:14:22,480
It's too risky.

13694
08:14:23,380 --> 08:14:24,420
Maybe here.

13695
08:14:26,540 --> 08:14:29,220
I'm just gonna block that guy up.

13696
08:14:30,400 --> 08:14:31,920
Okay, it's too risky.

13697
08:14:33,240 --> 08:14:34,660
Alright, I got some nuggies.

13698
08:14:35,660 --> 08:14:36,340
Okay, nice.

13699
08:14:36,640 --> 08:14:38,040
I'm digging for nuggies.

13700
08:14:38,960 --> 08:14:41,200
I have 51 on me.

13701
08:14:42,640 --> 08:14:44,120
I'm gonna make some now.

13702
08:14:44,700 --> 08:14:45,900
I don't know how I got up here.

13703
08:14:45,900 --> 08:14:46,580
I'm scared.

13704
08:14:48,720 --> 08:14:50,780
How did I get so high up?

13705
08:14:51,240 --> 08:14:52,040
I don't know.

13706
08:14:52,240 --> 08:14:53,120
What did I do?

13707
08:14:53,700 --> 08:14:56,560
You were blinded by the gold.

13708
08:14:57,040 --> 08:14:58,800
By the gold sickness.

13709
08:15:00,720 --> 08:15:03,820
We're literally like the guys in Pocahontas.

13710
08:15:04,900 --> 08:15:07,200
Gold, beautiful gold.

13711
08:15:08,100 --> 08:15:10,740
I don't know how the song goes.

13712
08:15:10,740 --> 08:15:11,540
I'm nummy nummy.

13713
08:15:12,440 --> 08:15:14,440
Alright, gold.

13714
08:15:15,920 --> 08:15:17,840
I have 5 more gold.

13715
08:15:20,280 --> 08:15:21,320
There's gas.

13716
08:15:22,500 --> 08:15:24,800
There's a gas right in front of us.

13717
08:15:25,300 --> 08:15:27,000
I'm in a cave.

13718
08:15:27,580 --> 08:15:28,400
Looking for gold.

13719
08:15:30,240 --> 08:15:32,160
There's a gas right here.

13720
08:15:33,120 --> 08:15:35,120
Just hide and he'll despawn eventually.

13721
08:15:35,900 --> 08:15:37,440
Don't rob me, little piggy.

13722
08:15:37,440 --> 08:15:38,800
Don't rob me, child.

13723
08:15:41,620 --> 08:15:42,580
He's like right there.

13724
08:15:42,700 --> 08:15:43,540
I don't have arrows.

13725
08:15:45,060 --> 08:15:46,460
Do you see where I am?

13726
08:15:46,560 --> 08:15:47,780
You can hide with me if you want.

13727
08:15:48,900 --> 08:15:51,040
Oh my god, he broke my crafting table.

13728
08:15:51,100 --> 08:15:51,540
No, I'm fine.

13729
08:15:52,380 --> 08:15:54,040
I got it.

13730
08:15:54,080 --> 08:15:54,580
I got it back.

13731
08:15:55,360 --> 08:15:58,460
I have wood, so if you do need another one...

13732
08:15:58,460 --> 08:16:00,140
Where did my other stack of wood go?

13733
08:16:02,900 --> 08:16:05,440
Oh, I do have...

13734
08:16:05,440 --> 08:16:08,060
I put some torches out in case...

13735
08:16:08,060 --> 08:16:09,880
Okay, this ghastly is like...

13736
08:16:09,880 --> 08:16:11,340
Cooking me from the pigs.

13737
08:16:12,880 --> 08:16:13,780
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

13738
08:16:13,820 --> 08:16:15,800
Just hide and wait until he despawns.

13739
08:16:18,340 --> 08:16:20,120
I tossed it back in the fortress.

13740
08:16:20,360 --> 08:16:20,520
Oops.

13741
08:16:23,980 --> 08:16:25,540
Why is he here?

13742
08:16:27,980 --> 08:16:30,300
I think it's really messed up...

13743
08:16:30,300 --> 08:16:32,120
that gas can spawn in all biomes.

13744
08:16:32,280 --> 08:16:33,720
I think that's probably...

13745
08:16:34,540 --> 08:16:36,960
I think whoever invented that...

13746
08:16:36,960 --> 08:16:37,880
just hates fun.

13747
08:16:38,600 --> 08:16:40,000
I seriously...

13748
08:16:40,000 --> 08:16:41,280
I think he just hates people.

13749
08:16:41,500 --> 08:16:45,120
It's actually the worst creature...

13750
08:16:45,120 --> 08:16:46,380
in Minecraft.

13751
08:16:47,200 --> 08:16:48,300
There's two now!

13752
08:16:48,480 --> 08:16:49,440
Two just spawned!

13753
08:16:52,660 --> 08:16:54,720
Instead of it despawning...

13754
08:16:55,360 --> 08:16:56,700
Two showed up!

13755
08:16:58,720 --> 08:17:00,780
We'll get bored of each other eventually.

13756
08:17:01,160 --> 08:17:01,620
Probably.

13757
08:17:03,960 --> 08:17:04,620
Shoot!

13758
08:17:06,300 --> 08:17:07,320
What arrows?

13759
08:17:07,720 --> 08:17:08,760
Somebody was like...

13760
08:17:08,760 --> 08:17:09,480
I have eight.

13761
08:17:10,780 --> 08:17:12,960
Time to use my eight arrows.

13762
08:17:13,060 --> 08:17:16,400
I have one arrow.

13763
08:17:17,180 --> 08:17:17,560
Alright.

13764
08:17:18,380 --> 08:17:19,320
Eight and a dream.

13765
08:17:19,560 --> 08:17:20,180
Let's go.

13766
08:17:23,940 --> 08:17:25,260
They despawned.

13767
08:17:25,440 --> 08:17:27,460
They actually despawned because I started crying.

13768
08:17:27,860 --> 08:17:28,420
Oh, good.

13769
08:17:29,280 --> 08:17:29,960
I cried too.

13770
08:17:31,520 --> 08:17:33,120
Where is the bug?

13771
08:17:37,540 --> 08:17:39,440
Why can't I get any gold?

13772
08:17:39,600 --> 08:17:40,260
Okay, you know what?

13773
08:17:40,320 --> 08:17:40,700
I give up.

13774
08:17:40,760 --> 08:17:41,180
I'm sorry.

13775
08:17:41,360 --> 08:17:41,760
I tried.

13776
08:17:42,800 --> 08:17:43,580
We're risking.

13777
08:17:43,780 --> 08:17:46,560
We're gonna risk it all...

13778
08:17:46,560 --> 08:17:49,220
on these five golds that I have.

13779
08:17:50,180 --> 08:17:51,380
Five golds left.

13780
08:17:52,100 --> 08:17:52,980
Five golds.

13781
08:17:53,020 --> 08:17:54,180
There's a lot of endermen now.

13782
08:17:54,300 --> 08:17:56,600
If you wanna come over to farm more enderpearls.

13783
08:17:56,740 --> 08:17:57,060
Yeah.

13784
08:17:57,440 --> 08:17:59,400
I'm looking around for them.

13785
08:18:01,080 --> 08:18:02,220
Oh my god.

13786
08:18:02,380 --> 08:18:03,040
Stop it!

13787
08:18:03,100 --> 08:18:03,600
Shut up!

13788
08:18:03,600 --> 08:18:05,200
You freak!

13789
08:18:05,800 --> 08:18:07,080
I don't have anything!

13790
08:18:08,700 --> 08:18:09,440
Oh my god.

13791
08:18:09,460 --> 08:18:10,360
It's just magmas.

13792
08:18:10,780 --> 08:18:12,080
It's just magmas.

13793
08:18:12,600 --> 08:18:13,120
Please.

13794
08:18:14,520 --> 08:18:15,820
Like the fire starters?

13795
08:18:16,780 --> 08:18:17,520
What is that?

13796
08:18:18,600 --> 08:18:19,500
What was this?

13797
08:18:19,640 --> 08:18:22,040
I got another splash potion of fire resistance.

13798
08:18:22,480 --> 08:18:23,340
Oh, that's good though.

13799
08:18:23,700 --> 08:18:24,920
I got a pearl.

13800
08:18:25,900 --> 08:18:27,840
I got another obsidian.

13801
08:18:27,980 --> 08:18:28,660
I got another one.

13802
08:18:29,600 --> 08:18:30,380
One more!

13803
08:18:30,380 --> 08:18:30,960
One more!

13804
08:18:31,540 --> 08:18:33,460
I don't have gold.

13805
08:18:33,580 --> 08:18:34,840
I don't have any more gold.

13806
08:18:35,920 --> 08:18:37,940
Come to my cave.

13807
08:18:38,040 --> 08:18:39,720
It's bad, but I started it.

13808
08:18:39,820 --> 08:18:41,000
So you can find it.

13809
08:18:41,340 --> 08:18:43,380
I don't trust myself.

13810
08:18:43,560 --> 08:18:45,860
I don't trust myself.

13811
08:18:45,900 --> 08:18:47,140
What if I dig into lava?

13812
08:18:47,520 --> 08:18:49,440
What if I dig into lava?

13813
08:18:49,760 --> 08:18:52,320
Then you block it.

13814
08:18:55,740 --> 08:18:57,300
Then you block the lava.

13815
08:18:59,420 --> 08:19:00,260
Oh my god.

13816
08:19:00,320 --> 08:19:01,840
How many lavas did you block?

13817
08:19:02,260 --> 08:19:02,880
Wait, we need 10?

13818
08:19:02,980 --> 08:19:03,960
I thought we needed 8.

13819
08:19:05,400 --> 08:19:07,900
I guess it wasn't 8.

13820
08:19:09,220 --> 08:19:12,160
Oh, nevermind.

13821
08:19:12,240 --> 08:19:12,780
We need 10.

13822
08:19:13,920 --> 08:19:15,140
We need 3 more.

13823
08:19:20,720 --> 08:19:22,440
It's 3 on each side.

13824
08:19:25,000 --> 08:19:26,120
2 on top.

13825
08:19:26,860 --> 08:19:27,520
Oh.

13826
08:19:29,080 --> 08:19:30,640
I found quartz.

13827
08:19:32,020 --> 08:19:33,330
I found quartz.

13828
08:19:34,040 --> 08:19:34,820
Look at that.

13829
08:19:34,880 --> 08:19:36,860
Look at that silly quartz over there.

13830
08:19:36,880 --> 08:19:38,280
What's 10 without the corners?

13831
08:19:38,580 --> 08:19:41,600
Oh, I thought it was 10 with the corners.

13832
08:19:41,980 --> 08:19:44,400
There's silly quartz over there.

13833
08:19:45,100 --> 08:19:45,880
Look at that.

13834
08:19:46,440 --> 08:19:47,380
It's so silly.

13835
08:19:48,040 --> 08:19:50,160
It's so silly.

13836
08:19:50,560 --> 08:19:51,320
So silly.

13837
08:19:51,920 --> 08:19:53,780
Silly little quartz.

13838
08:19:55,080 --> 08:19:56,940
Oh, there's another ghast.

13839
08:19:58,240 --> 08:19:58,760
Somewhere.

13840
08:20:01,000 --> 08:20:01,520
What?

13841
08:20:01,620 --> 08:20:01,900
What happened?

13842
08:20:02,060 --> 08:20:02,380
Lava?

13843
08:20:03,980 --> 08:20:05,720
Just stay far enough back.

13844
08:20:05,860 --> 08:20:07,020
Just stay far enough back.

13845
08:20:08,060 --> 08:20:10,100
Are you sure there's going to be gold here?

13846
08:20:11,140 --> 08:20:11,980
Are you sure?

13847
08:20:12,840 --> 08:20:13,380
I don't know.

13848
08:20:13,480 --> 08:20:15,140
I'm saying you can just use my hole.

13849
08:20:16,400 --> 08:20:17,880
It's a used hole.

13850
08:20:18,840 --> 08:20:19,740
I'm sorry.

13851
08:20:20,080 --> 08:20:21,600
Do you want to go build your own?

13852
08:20:23,820 --> 08:20:25,420
Go get your own new hole.

13853
08:20:25,540 --> 08:20:26,320
I don't know.

13854
08:20:30,340 --> 08:20:32,560
I said that because I used it.

13855
08:20:32,680 --> 08:20:35,820
And I didn't find anything in there.

13856
08:20:35,920 --> 08:20:37,100
Then probably you would do it.

13857
08:20:38,200 --> 08:20:39,360
You would find it.

13858
08:20:39,460 --> 08:20:40,780
That's how that works, right?

13859
08:20:43,960 --> 08:20:45,100
I'm going to go up.

13860
08:20:45,780 --> 08:20:47,060
There must be...

13861
08:20:47,060 --> 08:20:48,520
I wish the ghast would disappear.

13862
08:20:49,520 --> 08:20:50,320
Please leave.

13863
08:20:50,480 --> 08:20:51,440
You're not welcome here.

13864
08:20:51,440 --> 08:20:53,940
You're kind of unwelcome.

13865
08:20:54,800 --> 08:20:56,440
You're not welcome here.

13866
08:20:56,680 --> 08:20:57,760
Nobody likes you.

13867
08:20:57,920 --> 08:21:00,260
Even your mother hates you.

13868
08:21:00,320 --> 08:21:01,980
Yeah, nobody likes you.

13869
08:21:02,200 --> 08:21:03,840
Your mother put you up for adoption.

13870
08:21:04,060 --> 08:21:05,340
Nobody adopted you.

13871
08:21:12,260 --> 08:21:14,440
You were thinking the same thing.

13872
08:21:14,820 --> 08:21:18,920
I don't think I was thinking that extreme, that far.

13873
08:21:19,020 --> 08:21:20,880
You were thinking the same thing.

13874
08:21:21,440 --> 08:21:22,180
Don't lie.

13875
08:21:22,460 --> 08:21:23,940
It was in your head.

13876
08:21:24,620 --> 08:21:25,240
I don't know.

13877
08:21:25,480 --> 08:21:27,420
The ghasts...

13878
08:21:27,420 --> 08:21:28,360
How do they...

13879
08:21:28,360 --> 08:21:29,500
How do they board?

13880
08:21:38,980 --> 08:21:40,200
Stay back, mister.

13881
08:21:52,950 --> 08:21:54,290
Are you okay?

13882
08:21:55,690 --> 08:21:56,890
What are you doing?

13883
08:21:57,210 --> 08:21:58,230
I'm getting gold.

13884
08:21:58,470 --> 08:22:02,270
But I'm doing the most risky shit to get this fucking gold right now.

13885
08:22:02,290 --> 08:22:02,850
Do you want TNT?

13886
08:22:03,470 --> 08:22:03,750
No!

13887
08:22:04,770 --> 08:22:06,430
That's risky shit, man.

13888
08:22:06,530 --> 08:22:08,710
I can give you the good risky stuff.

13889
08:22:09,010 --> 08:22:09,710
The TNT.

13890
08:22:10,470 --> 08:22:12,390
It's the real risky stuff.

13891
08:22:13,790 --> 08:22:15,130
Blow it all up.

13892
08:22:15,450 --> 08:22:16,930
Blow it to hell, Donkey!

13893
08:22:22,730 --> 08:22:23,910
Open air gold.

13894
08:22:24,710 --> 08:22:26,530
You gotta go to TNT Anonymous.

13895
08:22:29,530 --> 08:22:31,750
I got more magma...

13896
08:22:31,750 --> 08:22:33,830
Magma cream...

13897
08:22:34,950 --> 08:22:39,510
Will help us make more fire resistant stuff, I guess.

13898
08:22:40,250 --> 08:22:40,470
Okay.

13899
08:22:42,030 --> 08:22:42,990
You know, man.

13900
08:22:43,250 --> 08:22:46,090
I feel like we're gonna make it to the end and then we're gonna die.

13901
08:22:46,490 --> 08:22:47,150
Don't say that.

13902
08:22:47,650 --> 08:22:50,170
I've been thinking it this entire time.

13903
08:22:51,270 --> 08:22:51,830
Don't!

13904
08:22:53,030 --> 08:22:55,610
I've been literally thinking it this entire time.

13905
08:22:55,870 --> 08:22:59,450
I think we're gonna make it and then we're gonna die.

13906
08:22:59,450 --> 08:23:00,990
The Ender Dragon is not that bad.

13907
08:23:01,050 --> 08:23:02,370
All we need is the slow falling.

13908
08:23:03,010 --> 08:23:04,670
What if we get there...

13909
08:23:04,670 --> 08:23:08,210
We do this thing and then the Ender Dragon...

13910
08:23:08,210 --> 08:23:11,570
He sweeps up and then knocks us out of the thing.

13911
08:23:11,830 --> 08:23:12,630
And then it happens.

13912
08:23:12,650 --> 08:23:14,530
All we need is the slow falling.

13913
08:23:15,250 --> 08:23:15,910
And then it happens.

13914
08:23:16,370 --> 08:23:17,990
How do we make it?

13915
08:23:19,550 --> 08:23:20,210
How do we make what?

13916
08:23:20,490 --> 08:23:21,470
Slow falling.

13917
08:23:22,490 --> 08:23:23,890
Oh, we need the phantoms.

13918
08:23:24,530 --> 08:23:25,290
We need to not sleep.

13919
08:23:25,290 --> 08:23:27,150
Okay, that's fine.

13920
08:23:28,010 --> 08:23:29,490
That should be fine, right?

13921
08:23:29,750 --> 08:23:30,670
That should be fine.

13922
08:23:31,050 --> 08:23:32,150
We can do that.

13923
08:23:32,270 --> 08:23:34,130
We can chill in a village.

13924
08:23:34,650 --> 08:23:36,790
When we don't sleep.

13925
08:23:37,070 --> 08:23:38,090
We just don't sleep.

13926
08:23:39,170 --> 08:23:39,690
What?

13927
08:23:40,590 --> 08:23:41,110
What?

13928
08:23:43,070 --> 08:23:44,390
It's a good thing.

13929
08:23:44,750 --> 08:23:46,330
What is it?

13930
08:23:46,970 --> 08:23:48,490
I found netherite.

13931
08:23:49,470 --> 08:23:50,370
Oh, just one?

13932
08:23:50,490 --> 08:23:52,050
You know we need a lot more.

13933
08:23:52,050 --> 08:23:54,510
Yeah, but I found some.

13934
08:23:54,650 --> 08:23:56,230
Even at 78.

13935
08:23:56,530 --> 08:23:57,930
Oh, I found two netherites.

13936
08:23:58,310 --> 08:24:01,010
Okay, now that's the good shit.

13937
08:24:04,050 --> 08:24:05,390
I almost looked at it.

13938
08:24:05,470 --> 08:24:06,930
There's a ghast here.

13939
08:24:07,050 --> 08:24:08,750
Why is there a ghast here?

13940
08:24:09,330 --> 08:24:10,570
I have to use the arrow.

13941
08:24:11,570 --> 08:24:11,870
I'm scared.

13942
08:24:12,070 --> 08:24:15,510
Where did he go?

13943
08:24:17,790 --> 08:24:18,690
No lava.

13944
08:24:18,910 --> 08:24:20,290
I know, I need no lava.

13945
08:24:20,290 --> 08:24:22,290
Oh my gosh, I can't believe there was two.

13946
08:24:23,070 --> 08:24:23,510
Wow.

13947
08:24:24,550 --> 08:24:25,630
Okay, gold.

13948
08:24:25,650 --> 08:24:26,330
Can I pick it up?

13949
08:24:27,450 --> 08:24:29,410
Okay, I have six now.

13950
08:24:29,710 --> 08:24:31,650
I have six gold.

13951
08:24:33,630 --> 08:24:34,070
Alright.

13952
08:24:34,470 --> 08:24:35,070
All in.

13953
08:24:36,790 --> 08:24:38,970
I know the lava won't burn it, but I don't wanna die.

13954
08:24:38,970 --> 08:24:39,030
Okay.

13955
08:24:53,750 --> 08:24:54,430
Wowee.

13956
08:24:55,570 --> 08:24:56,210
Hordes?

13957
08:24:56,670 --> 08:24:58,130
Please, out of these six.

13958
08:24:58,650 --> 08:25:00,290
Please, out of these six.

13959
08:25:00,410 --> 08:25:01,470
Just give me obsidian.

13960
08:25:01,790 --> 08:25:03,430
Please, not magma!

13961
08:25:03,990 --> 08:25:06,490
I gave you six gold!

13962
08:25:08,970 --> 08:25:09,610
Okay.

13963
08:25:13,570 --> 08:25:16,310
I got crying obsidian.

13964
08:25:17,290 --> 08:25:18,290
Crying?

13965
08:25:18,590 --> 08:25:19,910
That's literally you.

13966
08:25:21,270 --> 08:25:28,010
You gave me crying out of all the obsidians.

13967
08:25:28,770 --> 08:25:30,670
I'm so sorry.

13968
08:25:30,750 --> 08:25:37,050
I wasn't specific enough regarding the exact type of obsidian I needed.

13969
08:25:37,610 --> 08:25:39,910
I'm so sorry.

13970
08:25:40,670 --> 08:25:41,910
How much...

13971
08:25:41,910 --> 08:25:44,530
How much diamond do you have?

13972
08:25:44,730 --> 08:25:45,930
I have eleven.

13973
08:25:46,890 --> 08:25:47,330
Okay.

13974
08:25:48,290 --> 08:25:49,490
My pickaxe is about to...

13975
08:25:49,490 --> 08:25:51,550
Actually, I'll just make a...

13976
08:25:51,550 --> 08:25:53,250
I'll just make an iron one.

13977
08:25:53,870 --> 08:25:54,490
Alright.

13978
08:25:55,130 --> 08:25:56,930
Back into the mines we go.

13979
08:25:57,670 --> 08:25:59,310
Back into the...

13980
08:25:59,970 --> 08:26:01,170
I'm mining too.

13981
08:26:01,590 --> 08:26:02,370
Oh, you got some gold?

13982
08:26:03,090 --> 08:26:03,390
No.

13983
08:26:03,770 --> 08:26:05,470
I haven't gotten literally anything.

13984
08:26:05,470 --> 08:26:06,630
Except the net.

13985
08:26:06,790 --> 08:26:07,590
I got the netherite.

13986
08:26:07,690 --> 08:26:11,030
That's literally the only thing we actually need.

13987
08:26:11,070 --> 08:26:11,990
There's gold, I know.

13988
08:26:12,490 --> 08:26:14,690
Oh, and I made it to the other side.

13989
08:26:15,010 --> 08:26:16,570
I wish I kept all that obsidian.

13990
08:26:16,970 --> 08:26:19,950
I wish I kept all that obsidian earlier.

13991
08:26:20,370 --> 08:26:21,430
There's so many...

13992
08:26:21,430 --> 08:26:23,570
So many endermen around me.

13993
08:26:23,650 --> 08:26:25,710
I wish you were here to exterminate them.

13994
08:26:25,750 --> 08:26:28,150
I don't trust myself making a little house.

13995
08:26:28,410 --> 08:26:29,130
Okay, I'm coming.

13996
08:26:29,250 --> 08:26:29,510
I'm coming.

13997
08:26:30,510 --> 08:26:32,410
It's just a little house.

13998
08:26:32,950 --> 08:26:34,330
I don't trust myself.

13999
08:26:34,550 --> 08:26:36,890
There's like four endermen right next to me.

14000
08:26:37,110 --> 08:26:38,610
I hear a ghastly though.

14001
08:26:38,830 --> 08:26:39,330
Alright, come to me.

14002
08:26:39,430 --> 08:26:40,630
Come to me and make a house.

14003
08:26:41,910 --> 08:26:43,170
Oh my god, you're still alive?

14004
08:26:43,230 --> 08:26:44,770
Yes, we've been in the nether.

14005
08:26:44,930 --> 08:26:45,590
Yes, yes.

14006
08:26:45,770 --> 08:26:47,630
We've been in the nether.

14007
08:26:47,890 --> 08:26:48,630
Yes, yes.

14008
08:26:48,810 --> 08:26:52,070
We have been in the nether for like maybe four hours.

14009
08:26:52,590 --> 08:26:52,910
Where are you?

14010
08:26:54,210 --> 08:26:55,010
Look up.

14011
08:26:56,030 --> 08:26:57,870
Hold on, I'm getting endermen.

14012
08:26:57,870 --> 08:26:58,450
Oh.

14013
08:27:00,030 --> 08:27:01,090
Come here.

14014
08:27:01,530 --> 08:27:02,490
Come here, Endy.

14015
08:27:03,630 --> 08:27:04,230
Endy.

14016
08:27:06,170 --> 08:27:06,930
Endy.

14017
08:27:08,150 --> 08:27:08,910
Endy.

14018
08:27:09,470 --> 08:27:10,530
One more.

14019
08:27:11,450 --> 08:27:12,470
One more again.

14020
08:27:13,390 --> 08:27:15,030
One more, one more.

14021
08:27:16,570 --> 08:27:16,970
Yeah.

14022
08:27:17,930 --> 08:27:18,690
I'm this guy too.

14023
08:27:19,990 --> 08:27:21,290
Where are you?

14024
08:27:22,270 --> 08:27:23,810
Um, you know, just...

14025
08:27:23,810 --> 08:27:25,890
Just here with all these endermens.

14026
08:27:25,890 --> 08:27:27,670
I'm with endermen too!

14027
08:27:28,250 --> 08:27:30,050
All of them right here.

14028
08:27:30,250 --> 08:27:32,270
You know, just hanging out, I guess.

14029
08:27:32,510 --> 08:27:33,850
You know, just...

14030
08:27:33,850 --> 08:27:36,010
I see gold, but it's kind of like...

14031
08:27:37,150 --> 08:27:39,030
No, they're very risky gold.

14032
08:27:39,130 --> 08:27:41,410
They are definitely very risky gold.

14033
08:27:42,030 --> 08:27:44,990
I've been enjoying some risky gold lately.

14034
08:27:46,330 --> 08:27:48,330
I've been risking it all.

14035
08:27:48,590 --> 08:27:49,610
The thrill of the hunt.

14036
08:27:49,950 --> 08:27:51,490
Are you feeling the thrill?

14037
08:27:52,050 --> 08:27:53,630
I feel it.

14038
08:27:53,670 --> 08:27:54,930
I'm feeling it, Mr. Krabs.

14039
08:27:54,930 --> 08:27:56,770
I'm fucking feeling it right now.

14040
08:27:57,010 --> 08:28:00,930
Oh my gosh, nothing.

14041
08:28:02,970 --> 08:28:04,290
I left for four hours.

14042
08:28:04,470 --> 08:28:05,110
What happened?

14043
08:28:11,470 --> 08:28:12,970
Oh, that's a good one.

14044
08:28:13,230 --> 08:28:14,250
That's a good one.

14045
08:28:15,430 --> 08:28:16,630
Oh, that's good.

14046
08:28:16,710 --> 08:28:17,310
That's rich.

14047
08:28:17,510 --> 08:28:18,430
That's real rich.

14048
08:28:19,730 --> 08:28:20,910
Where are you?

14049
08:28:22,610 --> 08:28:24,750
I'm fucking feeling really...

14050
08:28:24,750 --> 08:28:26,590
Really risky right now.

14051
08:28:26,710 --> 08:28:27,990
Just really risky.

14052
08:28:28,430 --> 08:28:29,930
Don't, don't, please.

14053
08:28:30,850 --> 08:28:31,190
Whoa.

14054
08:28:32,090 --> 08:28:34,430
It'd be so silly if something just...

14055
08:28:34,430 --> 08:28:35,590
Something happened.

14056
08:28:36,490 --> 08:28:36,810
No!

14057
08:28:37,510 --> 08:28:38,650
Oh my god, gas.

14058
08:28:38,810 --> 08:28:39,550
No, please.

14059
08:28:39,730 --> 08:28:40,730
I'm coming back.

14060
08:28:41,490 --> 08:28:43,690
I have more gold.

14061
08:28:44,830 --> 08:28:46,030
I got a stack.

14062
08:28:48,330 --> 08:28:49,070
Let's go.

14063
08:28:49,170 --> 08:28:49,370
Let's go.

14064
08:28:49,370 --> 08:28:50,750
Oh, I almost fell into this.

14065
08:28:51,970 --> 08:28:53,330
That would've been...

14066
08:28:53,330 --> 08:28:54,530
Pretty dramatic.

14067
08:28:54,990 --> 08:28:55,430
Okay.

14068
08:28:56,790 --> 08:28:58,110
Pretty bad, I'd say.

14069
08:28:58,950 --> 08:28:59,550
I have seven.

14070
08:28:59,630 --> 08:29:00,430
I have seven more.

14071
08:29:00,970 --> 08:29:02,210
Seven more stacks, let's go.

14072
08:29:02,590 --> 08:29:03,470
Seven more.

14073
08:29:04,670 --> 08:29:06,450
I thought I saw some gold over here.

14074
08:29:06,690 --> 08:29:09,310
I was just gonna...

14075
08:29:09,310 --> 08:29:10,330
Oh, there you go.

14076
08:29:11,110 --> 08:29:12,230
Oh, I see some up here.

14077
08:29:12,330 --> 08:29:13,010
Okay, I'll get that.

14078
08:29:13,010 --> 08:29:14,790
Alright, here we go.

14079
08:29:14,930 --> 08:29:17,010
Back in the... Oh, this might be risky, but...

14080
08:29:18,130 --> 08:29:18,610
We'll see.

14081
08:29:19,630 --> 08:29:20,650
There he is.

14082
08:29:20,950 --> 08:29:21,990
There he is.

14083
08:29:22,810 --> 08:29:23,970
There he is.

14084
08:29:24,110 --> 08:29:27,030
How many inner pearls do you have?

14085
08:29:28,270 --> 08:29:28,810
Three.

14086
08:29:29,830 --> 08:29:31,390
Yeah, that's three, so we have six.

14087
08:29:31,570 --> 08:29:32,550
Oh, here's the arrows.

14088
08:29:34,470 --> 08:29:36,230
I'm getting more gold.

14089
08:29:38,830 --> 08:29:39,630
What'd he give you?

14090
08:29:41,630 --> 08:29:42,410
What'd he give you?

14091
08:29:43,070 --> 08:29:43,850
Is that it?

14092
08:29:44,770 --> 08:29:45,530
Is that it?

14093
08:29:45,770 --> 08:29:47,510
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

14094
08:29:47,610 --> 08:29:48,390
I'm so sorry.

14095
08:29:48,990 --> 08:29:49,590
Is that it?

14096
08:29:51,090 --> 08:29:53,090
Oh, I got another one.

14097
08:29:53,250 --> 08:29:54,430
I got another one.

14098
08:29:55,770 --> 08:29:57,050
We got another one.

14099
08:29:57,230 --> 08:29:59,110
We need two more.

14100
08:29:59,450 --> 08:30:00,930
Yes, we need two more.

14101
08:30:01,050 --> 08:30:03,630
We need two more.

14102
08:30:07,650 --> 08:30:07,930
Two more.

14103
08:30:11,150 --> 08:30:12,370
Did I grab that?

14104
08:30:12,570 --> 08:30:13,310
Wait, where did it go?

14105
08:30:13,730 --> 08:30:15,030
Where did the... Where did it go?

14106
08:30:15,330 --> 08:30:15,730
No!

14107
08:30:15,990 --> 08:30:16,890
Where did it go?

14108
08:30:17,550 --> 08:30:18,730
We'll never know.

14109
08:30:19,290 --> 08:30:20,450
We'll never know.

14110
08:30:21,270 --> 08:30:22,770
We'll never know.

14111
08:30:22,990 --> 08:30:24,390
Thank you for the arrow, sir.

14112
08:30:24,910 --> 08:30:26,530
Alright, last one.

14113
08:30:27,050 --> 08:30:28,490
Last one.

14114
08:30:29,830 --> 08:30:30,230
Okay.

14115
08:30:31,830 --> 08:30:36,410
I like when people come in and are just like, how have they been up to this for eight hours?

14116
08:30:36,410 --> 08:30:37,270
It's gravel.

14117
08:30:38,190 --> 08:30:39,310
It's gravel.

14118
08:30:39,690 --> 08:30:41,550
It's like... It's fucking gravel.

14119
08:30:42,130 --> 08:30:45,110
Here I have... I have fourteen pieces of nuggets.

14120
08:30:45,490 --> 08:30:47,590
Fourteen... Only fourteen nuggets?

14121
08:30:47,790 --> 08:30:48,830
I'm sorry!

14122
08:30:49,050 --> 08:30:50,330
It was all that I could get!

14123
08:30:50,370 --> 08:30:51,770
Only fourteen nuggets?

14124
08:30:52,110 --> 08:30:52,590
Okay.

14125
08:30:54,050 --> 08:30:56,530
That nugget could be life or death.

14126
08:30:58,410 --> 08:31:00,410
Alright, here's... Where are you?

14127
08:31:00,510 --> 08:31:01,030
Here you go.

14128
08:31:01,490 --> 08:31:03,650
Here's... Here's the obsidian next to you.

14129
08:31:03,890 --> 08:31:04,730
Oh, wait.

14130
08:31:04,810 --> 08:31:05,090
Hold on.

14131
08:31:05,150 --> 08:31:05,310
Hold on.

14132
08:31:05,410 --> 08:31:05,610
Hold on.

14133
08:31:07,090 --> 08:31:08,170
He won't attack you.

14134
08:31:08,250 --> 08:31:09,170
He's aggroed on me.

14135
08:31:09,170 --> 08:31:09,550
Okay.

14136
08:31:10,370 --> 08:31:11,210
Where is it?

14137
08:31:11,690 --> 08:31:12,170
Did you give it to me?

14138
08:31:12,190 --> 08:31:12,810
No, no.

14139
08:31:12,990 --> 08:31:13,850
I took it back.

14140
08:31:14,170 --> 08:31:15,310
I'll give it to you later.

14141
08:31:15,790 --> 08:31:16,710
Oh, I got it.

14142
08:31:16,770 --> 08:31:17,210
Okay, come here.

14143
08:31:18,050 --> 08:31:18,570
I'll take it.

14144
08:31:18,770 --> 08:31:19,930
Alright, here you go.

14145
08:31:22,550 --> 08:31:23,150
Here you go.

14146
08:31:23,210 --> 08:31:24,030
Here's two more.

14147
08:31:24,270 --> 08:31:25,230
Here's two more.

14148
08:31:25,290 --> 08:31:25,810
Two more!

14149
08:31:27,330 --> 08:31:28,370
We just need two!

14150
08:31:28,950 --> 08:31:29,950
Two out of two?

14151
08:31:31,050 --> 08:31:32,050
Crying obsidian.

14152
08:31:33,190 --> 08:31:34,290
Crying obsidian.

14153
08:31:34,970 --> 08:31:36,510
At least he gave us two.

14154
08:31:36,650 --> 08:31:37,110
Quartz.

14155
08:31:37,670 --> 08:31:38,090
Quartz.

14156
08:31:38,730 --> 08:31:40,270
Hey, he gave us two though!

14157
08:31:40,630 --> 08:31:41,630
He gave us two!

14158
08:31:44,010 --> 08:31:45,870
He gave us two!

14159
08:31:48,510 --> 08:31:49,810
There's a lot above us.

14160
08:31:49,850 --> 08:31:50,950
I'm fucking doing it.

14161
08:31:51,230 --> 08:31:52,230
It's life or death.

14162
08:31:52,290 --> 08:31:53,270
It's above us.

14163
08:31:53,310 --> 08:31:54,330
It's life or death.

14164
08:31:54,450 --> 08:31:55,810
I'm fucking... I'm going for it.

14165
08:31:56,170 --> 08:31:57,510
I'm gonna go for it.

14166
08:31:57,550 --> 08:31:58,610
I'm gonna go above.

14167
08:31:58,610 --> 08:31:59,890
I'm going up.

14168
08:31:59,950 --> 08:32:01,730
I'm gonna go up and see the world!

14169
08:32:01,830 --> 08:32:02,290
Mom!

14170
08:32:02,530 --> 08:32:03,570
I'm gonna do it!

14171
08:32:05,730 --> 08:32:12,990
Okay, when you do it, build like a little bridge underneath it and don't walk underneath it, you know?

14172
08:32:13,290 --> 08:32:15,270
I'm gonna see the world!

14173
08:32:17,630 --> 08:32:19,130
Where is this?

14174
08:32:20,290 --> 08:32:22,090
Catch them all!

14175
08:32:22,970 --> 08:32:24,450
Catch them all!

14176
08:32:25,270 --> 08:32:26,430
They're in the trees.

14177
08:32:26,450 --> 08:32:27,650
I got one of them.

14178
08:32:29,710 --> 08:32:31,290
There's more over there.

14179
08:32:31,430 --> 08:32:33,370
Okay, there's more over here too.

14180
08:32:33,530 --> 08:32:34,630
I'm gonna grab it.

14181
08:32:34,650 --> 08:32:35,690
Wait, I can't grab it.

14182
08:32:35,770 --> 08:32:36,190
Oh, shoot.

14183
08:32:36,270 --> 08:32:37,050
Oh, get rid of that.

14184
08:32:37,110 --> 08:32:37,610
Okay, there we go.

14185
08:32:39,710 --> 08:32:40,250
I grabbed some.

14186
08:32:40,370 --> 08:32:40,850
I grabbed some.

14187
08:32:41,270 --> 08:32:42,630
I don't know where the other ones are.

14188
08:32:42,870 --> 08:32:44,250
Okay, I got some here too.

14189
08:32:44,790 --> 08:32:45,450
How many you got?

14190
08:32:46,310 --> 08:32:46,710
Nine?

14191
08:32:47,030 --> 08:32:48,250
Okay, I got 21.

14192
08:32:48,490 --> 08:32:50,230
Okay, there's more over here.

14193
08:32:50,370 --> 08:32:54,430
I'm gonna fucking...

14194
08:32:54,430 --> 08:32:57,750
They're just like, yeah, take her tower.

14195
08:32:58,130 --> 08:32:58,450
No!

14196
08:32:59,470 --> 08:33:01,170
Do you know how much we've been through?

14197
08:33:01,350 --> 08:33:02,670
We've been through so much.

14198
08:33:02,890 --> 08:33:04,610
We are past sabotage!

14199
08:33:05,530 --> 08:33:06,490
We're past it.

14200
08:33:06,590 --> 08:33:09,130
We are so past it.

14201
08:33:09,670 --> 08:33:11,870
We can't...

14202
08:33:11,870 --> 08:33:13,270
You're like, haha, wouldn't it be funny?

14203
08:33:13,370 --> 08:33:16,830
I know you've been streaming for eight hours, but wouldn't you just kill her right now?

14204
08:33:17,430 --> 08:33:18,750
Don't worry, we'll just do it.

14205
08:33:18,810 --> 08:33:20,130
We don't have to kill each other.

14206
08:33:20,210 --> 08:33:22,270
The dragon's gonna do it for us!

14207
08:33:22,270 --> 08:33:23,370
No, it's not!

14208
08:33:25,490 --> 08:33:27,410
We'll just do the bed strut.

14209
08:33:27,570 --> 08:33:29,290
Catch it, catch it, catch it!

14210
08:33:29,550 --> 08:33:30,130
Catch what?

14211
08:33:30,190 --> 08:33:31,370
I don't even know where you are!

14212
08:33:32,810 --> 08:33:35,230
Okay, hold on, I see you.

14213
08:33:35,450 --> 08:33:37,390
I caught it, I caught it, I caught it, I caught it.

14214
08:33:37,690 --> 08:33:38,410
Oh, I see you.

14215
08:33:38,510 --> 08:33:39,070
Grab that one.

14216
08:33:39,430 --> 08:33:39,930
You got it.

14217
08:33:40,030 --> 08:33:40,910
Oh, no, you didn't get it.

14218
08:33:40,990 --> 08:33:41,730
There you go, you got it.

14219
08:33:42,550 --> 08:33:43,850
Okay, I have 37 here.

14220
08:33:46,150 --> 08:33:46,470
Alright.

14221
08:33:46,830 --> 08:33:47,270
I have nine.

14222
08:33:47,270 --> 08:33:50,050
Okay, pass it along, pass it along.

14223
08:33:50,170 --> 08:33:50,730
I'm getting mad.

14224
08:33:50,770 --> 08:33:52,130
I've got another seven rolls.

14225
08:33:52,630 --> 08:33:54,610
Another seven...

14226
08:33:54,610 --> 08:33:56,770
I think we could've traveled back!

14227
08:33:57,130 --> 08:33:58,130
I think...

14228
08:33:58,130 --> 08:34:00,110
No, we definitely could not have.

14229
08:34:00,110 --> 08:34:00,730
We could've died.

14230
08:34:00,870 --> 08:34:01,910
No, you're right, we could've died.

14231
08:34:01,910 --> 08:34:03,770
Yeah, we definitely could not have.

14232
08:34:04,430 --> 08:34:05,790
No, you're right, you're right.

14233
08:34:06,050 --> 08:34:09,070
We definitely would've died trying to travel back.

14234
08:34:09,870 --> 08:34:11,270
Where's the Enderman?

14235
08:34:12,410 --> 08:34:12,910
Enderman!

14236
08:34:14,310 --> 08:34:14,810
Enderman!

14237
08:34:15,990 --> 08:34:17,610
Please, my sweet Enderman.

14238
08:34:18,930 --> 08:34:21,470
Oh my god, I don't want the child to rob me again.

14239
08:34:21,710 --> 08:34:22,310
I know, I know.

14240
08:34:26,570 --> 08:34:28,950
Don't Akasupa with that.

14241
08:34:29,130 --> 08:34:30,390
What did he... Trying to bait me.

14242
08:34:30,470 --> 08:34:31,850
Oh, to kill me?

14243
08:34:32,370 --> 08:34:32,870
No!

14244
08:34:33,650 --> 08:34:35,630
You're trying to make me say something!

14245
08:34:42,070 --> 08:34:46,690
I know what you're trying to make me say.

14246
08:34:47,750 --> 08:34:51,870
I don't want your stupid iron nugget, please.

14247
08:34:53,190 --> 08:34:55,330
Oh my god, please.

14248
08:34:55,570 --> 08:34:58,230
Why do you keep giving me cries?!

14249
08:34:58,230 --> 08:35:00,190
He keeps giving me cries!

14250
08:35:00,390 --> 08:35:00,770
He's an idiot!

14251
08:35:01,570 --> 08:35:03,690
He's an idiot, oh my god.

14252
08:35:04,250 --> 08:35:06,610
I wish you could like, decry the Enderman.

14253
08:35:06,610 --> 08:35:10,910
He keeps giving me crying, I'm serious.

14254
08:35:11,510 --> 08:35:13,510
He keeps doing it!

14255
08:35:13,790 --> 08:35:14,790
He does!

14256
08:35:15,230 --> 08:35:15,590
He does!

14257
08:35:17,390 --> 08:35:20,770
I'm gonna fucking... I'm gonna shoot you!

14258
08:35:21,610 --> 08:35:23,430
I'm done, I'm missing!

14259
08:35:25,650 --> 08:35:27,870
I missed every shot.

14260
08:35:28,630 --> 08:35:31,030
I can't even...

14261
08:35:31,240 --> 08:35:33,190
I can't hit him!

14262
08:35:36,610 --> 08:35:37,730
I can't hit him anymore.

14263
08:35:38,750 --> 08:35:39,810
You did it!

14264
08:35:39,890 --> 08:35:40,390
You did it!

14265
08:35:40,630 --> 08:35:44,990
I did the thing I can't fly again.

14266
08:35:45,490 --> 08:35:45,490
You did the thing!

14267
08:35:46,030 --> 08:35:46,730
You did it!

14268
08:35:47,610 --> 08:35:48,890
I did it.

14269
08:35:49,530 --> 08:35:51,510
There's an Enderman right behind you too.

14270
08:35:52,730 --> 08:35:53,250
Oh, I see him.

14271
08:35:53,330 --> 08:35:53,610
Thank you.

14272
08:35:54,610 --> 08:35:55,630
Come here, agros.

14273
08:35:56,390 --> 08:35:56,870
Come here.

14274
08:35:57,630 --> 08:35:59,430
Alright, time to go.

14275
08:35:59,770 --> 08:36:01,590
Drop your pearls, poop them out.

14276
08:36:02,030 --> 08:36:02,670
Poop out your pearls.

14277
08:36:03,830 --> 08:36:07,110
Time to look up again.

14278
08:36:08,450 --> 08:36:10,570
Oh, I got five!

14279
08:36:11,250 --> 08:36:12,210
I got five pearls!

14280
08:36:14,050 --> 08:36:15,030
Oh, hi.

14281
08:36:15,310 --> 08:36:15,730
Oh my god.

14282
08:36:18,750 --> 08:36:20,730
I believe in us.

14283
08:36:21,970 --> 08:36:24,130
I can't believe I wanted to start later.

14284
08:36:25,030 --> 08:36:26,730
That's what I said earlier!

14285
08:36:27,710 --> 08:36:28,650
I can't believe it.

14286
08:36:28,690 --> 08:36:29,630
I didn't know.

14287
08:36:29,630 --> 08:36:32,530
I was like, are you... I thought... I literally while you were gone, I was like...

14288
08:36:32,530 --> 08:36:37,410
I really thought when she proposed this that she wanted to start in the morning and like go all day.

14289
08:36:37,890 --> 08:36:39,150
But no, you were like...

14290
08:36:39,150 --> 08:36:40,150
Let's just do it.

14291
08:36:40,270 --> 08:36:40,750
Oh shit!

14292
08:36:40,970 --> 08:36:41,470
Oh shit!

14293
08:36:41,670 --> 08:36:42,070
Oh my god.

14294
08:36:42,310 --> 08:36:42,650
Oh my god.

14295
08:36:42,710 --> 08:36:42,990
I'm dead.

14296
08:36:43,110 --> 08:36:43,530
I might be dead.

14297
08:36:43,610 --> 08:36:43,970
I might be dead.

14298
08:36:44,110 --> 08:36:44,590
I might be dead.

14299
08:36:44,750 --> 08:36:45,190
I might be dead.

14300
08:36:45,510 --> 08:36:46,190
Oh shit, shit.

14301
08:36:46,550 --> 08:36:46,610
No.

14302
08:36:47,730 --> 08:36:48,510
No, I'm okay.

14303
08:36:48,650 --> 08:36:48,870
I'm okay.

14304
08:36:49,110 --> 08:36:50,190
I'm coming down here.

14305
08:36:50,350 --> 08:36:50,710
Where is he?

14306
08:36:50,770 --> 08:36:51,210
Hold on.

14307
08:36:51,370 --> 08:36:51,810
Hold on.

14308
08:36:52,030 --> 08:36:52,450
No, I'm okay.

14309
08:36:52,490 --> 08:36:52,770
I'm okay.

14310
08:36:52,950 --> 08:36:53,410
I'm okay.

14311
08:36:54,330 --> 08:36:54,790
I'm okay.

14312
08:36:55,030 --> 08:36:55,410
I'm okay.

14313
08:36:55,430 --> 08:36:56,450
I dropped down.

14314
08:36:56,530 --> 08:36:57,430
I dropped down.

14315
08:36:57,490 --> 08:36:58,190
Are you okay?

14316
08:36:58,190 --> 08:36:59,530
I dropped down.

14317
08:36:59,530 --> 08:37:00,950
I dropped down.

14318
08:37:01,190 --> 08:37:02,290
Yeah, I'm okay.

14319
08:37:02,370 --> 08:37:02,370
I'm okay.

14320
08:37:02,370 --> 08:37:02,370
Okay.

14321
08:37:02,390 --> 08:37:02,390
Okay.

14322
08:37:02,390 --> 08:37:02,630
Back.

14323
08:37:03,150 --> 08:37:03,750
Back to hunting.

14324
08:37:04,410 --> 08:37:05,270
What the fuck?

14325
08:37:05,370 --> 08:37:06,330
Uh-oh, I'm not okay.

14326
08:37:06,490 --> 08:37:07,010
I'm not okay.

14327
08:37:07,110 --> 08:37:07,870
No, no, no, no.

14328
08:37:07,870 --> 08:37:08,690
I'm really not okay.

14329
08:37:08,950 --> 08:37:09,670
I'm really not okay.

14330
08:37:09,870 --> 08:37:10,410
I'm really not okay.

14331
08:37:12,150 --> 08:37:12,770
I'm not okay.

14332
08:37:12,870 --> 08:37:13,250
I'm not okay.

14333
08:37:13,430 --> 08:37:13,790
I'm not okay.

14334
08:37:13,910 --> 08:37:14,310
I'm not okay.

14335
08:37:14,430 --> 08:37:14,990
I'm not okay.

14336
08:37:15,130 --> 08:37:15,470
I'm not okay.

14337
08:37:15,710 --> 08:37:16,210
I'm not okay.

14338
08:37:17,310 --> 08:37:17,730
Climb up.

14339
08:37:17,870 --> 08:37:18,210
Climb up.

14340
08:37:18,290 --> 08:37:18,670
Climb up.

14341
08:37:18,750 --> 08:37:19,410
Can you climb up?

14342
08:37:20,970 --> 08:37:21,650
I got him.

14343
08:37:21,710 --> 08:37:22,110
I got him.

14344
08:37:22,150 --> 08:37:22,430
I got him.

14345
08:37:22,450 --> 08:37:22,850
I'm gonna die.

14346
08:37:22,910 --> 08:37:23,770
I'm gonna die.

14347
08:37:23,870 --> 08:37:24,170
I'm gonna die.

14348
08:37:24,250 --> 08:37:24,530
I'm gonna die.

14349
08:37:24,570 --> 08:37:24,770
I'm gonna die.

14350
08:37:24,770 --> 08:37:24,990
I got him.

14351
08:37:25,070 --> 08:37:25,430
I got him.

14352
08:37:25,470 --> 08:37:25,890
I got him.

14353
08:37:25,910 --> 08:37:26,330
I got him.

14354
08:37:26,370 --> 08:37:26,810
I got him.

14355
08:37:26,890 --> 08:37:27,370
I got him.

14356
08:37:27,510 --> 08:37:28,370
I got him.

14357
08:37:28,370 --> 08:37:29,250
Just heal!

14358
08:37:29,750 --> 08:37:30,170
Just heal!

14359
08:37:30,530 --> 08:37:31,550
Calm down!

14360
08:37:31,810 --> 08:37:32,250
Heal!

14361
08:37:32,470 --> 08:37:32,950
Heal!

14362
08:37:33,230 --> 08:37:33,710
Heal!

14363
08:37:33,950 --> 08:37:34,710
Calm down!

14364
08:37:34,970 --> 08:37:35,830
Calm down and heal!

14365
08:37:35,830 --> 08:37:36,270
I'm calm!

14366
08:37:36,330 --> 08:37:36,890
I'm calm!

14367
08:37:38,910 --> 08:37:40,310
That's why he attacked me.

14368
08:37:40,390 --> 08:37:41,170
I was like, why did I...

14369
08:37:41,170 --> 08:37:42,630
You don't have your helmet!

14370
08:37:42,870 --> 08:37:43,770
You got...

14371
08:37:43,770 --> 08:37:44,410
I know!

14372
08:37:44,510 --> 08:37:44,810
I know!

14373
08:37:44,890 --> 08:37:45,150
I know!

14374
08:37:45,190 --> 08:37:46,610
It broke because of the Enderman!

14375
08:37:47,690 --> 08:37:49,370
Oh my god...

14376
08:37:50,210 --> 08:37:51,730
Oh my god!

14377
08:37:52,750 --> 08:37:54,110
What was your heart?

14378
08:37:54,430 --> 08:37:55,350
What were your hearts?

14379
08:37:55,770 --> 08:37:57,870
I was at one and a half, I think.

14380
08:37:57,870 --> 08:37:57,910
Oh!

14381
08:37:59,810 --> 08:38:00,410
Yes!

14382
08:38:01,770 --> 08:38:03,610
I thought I was gonna die for real!

14383
08:38:04,050 --> 08:38:05,390
Oh my god!

14384
08:38:05,450 --> 08:38:07,510
What happened to your house?

14385
08:38:07,870 --> 08:38:09,530
What happened to your house?

14386
08:38:09,530 --> 08:38:13,370
I went underneath and then I got shoved out by the pig because...

14387
08:38:13,370 --> 08:38:15,630
Because I wasn't wearing the gold!

14388
08:38:15,970 --> 08:38:17,570
Oh my god...

14389
08:38:17,570 --> 08:38:18,490
I'm healing you guys!

14390
08:38:18,590 --> 08:38:19,010
I'm healing!

14391
08:38:19,050 --> 08:38:21,250
That was like some PTSD right there.

14392
08:38:21,450 --> 08:38:23,170
I would've all been over.

14393
08:38:24,150 --> 08:38:27,850
All that gold I found...

14394
08:38:27,850 --> 08:38:29,490
All that gold I found...

14395
08:38:29,490 --> 08:38:31,770
It would've all been over.

14396
08:38:32,110 --> 08:38:32,750
Oh my god!

14397
08:38:33,790 --> 08:38:35,590
Oh my god!

14398
08:38:36,590 --> 08:38:37,590
Oh my god!

14399
08:38:37,590 --> 08:38:38,750
There's no more gold.

14400
08:38:38,910 --> 08:38:42,210
There's no more gold in the wall, in the ceiling.

14401
08:38:42,210 --> 08:38:42,850
Okay, come here, Enderman.

14402
08:38:43,290 --> 08:38:44,330
Oh my god!

14403
08:38:45,570 --> 08:38:45,910
What?

14404
08:38:46,650 --> 08:38:48,770
There's seven Endermans right here.

14405
08:38:49,570 --> 08:38:50,270
In the corner.

14406
08:38:50,430 --> 08:38:52,090
Wait, I think this is a good farm spot.

14407
08:38:52,670 --> 08:38:53,470
Get over here.

14408
08:38:54,050 --> 08:38:54,690
Okay, hold on.

14409
08:38:54,870 --> 08:38:55,790
I'm getting this guy.

14410
08:38:56,350 --> 08:38:57,790
There's seven Endermans...

14411
08:38:58,850 --> 08:38:59,770
right in the corner.

14412
08:39:00,230 --> 08:39:01,610
They hit so hard.

14413
08:39:01,710 --> 08:39:02,470
They hit so hard.

14414
08:39:02,550 --> 08:39:03,410
Oh, he gave me soup.

14415
08:39:04,210 --> 08:39:04,950
Thanks for the soup.

14416
08:39:05,170 --> 08:39:06,790
Oh my god, I looked at them once.

14417
08:39:07,010 --> 08:39:08,810
Where are you?

14418
08:39:08,990 --> 08:39:09,810
Okay, I'll show you.

14419
08:39:10,130 --> 08:39:11,090
You gotta make a house.

14420
08:39:11,750 --> 08:39:13,730
Yeah, I'll make the house.

14421
08:39:13,930 --> 08:39:14,790
Just show me where.

14422
08:39:15,170 --> 08:39:16,490
Okay, come with me.

14423
08:39:16,930 --> 08:39:17,370
I'm coming.

14424
08:39:17,490 --> 08:39:18,010
I'm right behind you.

14425
08:39:19,210 --> 08:39:20,210
Okay, this is a little dangerous.

14426
08:39:20,330 --> 08:39:20,970
No, no, don't go here.

14427
08:39:21,150 --> 08:39:22,690
We go up with rocks.

14428
08:39:22,690 --> 08:39:24,130
Okay, okay.

14429
08:39:31,160 --> 08:39:31,720
How?

14430
08:39:32,420 --> 08:39:32,700
Here.

14431
08:39:34,360 --> 08:39:35,480
I made...

14432
08:39:35,480 --> 08:39:37,540
I made the wrong area.

14433
08:39:38,220 --> 08:39:39,120
Oh, just kidding.

14434
08:39:39,440 --> 08:39:41,200
Here we go.

14435
08:39:41,360 --> 08:39:42,280
It's in this corner.

14436
08:39:42,540 --> 08:39:43,400
It's very scary.

14437
08:39:43,660 --> 08:39:44,920
Just a warning.

14438
08:39:45,100 --> 08:39:46,380
It's a very scary corner.

14439
08:39:46,640 --> 08:39:47,860
Alright, I'm ready.

14440
08:39:48,160 --> 08:39:48,660
I'm looking down.

14441
08:39:49,360 --> 08:39:50,020
You're gonna see it.

14442
08:39:50,380 --> 08:39:51,620
It's right in this corner.

14443
08:39:51,620 --> 08:39:53,680
It's right over there in that corner to our left.

14444
08:39:53,800 --> 08:39:55,280
You're gonna see seven Endermans.

14445
08:39:55,320 --> 08:39:56,240
Oh my god.

14446
08:39:57,200 --> 08:39:58,820
Oh my god, I see them.

14447
08:39:59,020 --> 08:39:59,860
What the hell?

14448
08:40:00,300 --> 08:40:02,080
Okay, I'm going over.

14449
08:40:03,000 --> 08:40:05,980
I don't know what they're doing over there, but there's a party.

14450
08:40:07,020 --> 08:40:08,100
I hear them.

14451
08:40:08,660 --> 08:40:09,920
I hear them.

14452
08:40:10,060 --> 08:40:11,300
What the hell is happening?

14453
08:40:13,100 --> 08:40:15,620
Goodbye, my diamond pickaxe.

14454
08:40:15,720 --> 08:40:17,120
Mine is almost dead too.

14455
08:40:17,280 --> 08:40:17,900
Wait, where are they?

14456
08:40:17,900 --> 08:40:19,120
Oh my god.

14457
08:40:19,620 --> 08:40:21,080
You scared me, Enderman.

14458
08:40:22,280 --> 08:40:24,240
Make sure you make your thing.

14459
08:40:26,020 --> 08:40:27,200
I'm trying to make my house.

14460
08:40:27,440 --> 08:40:28,700
I think we have to leave here.

14461
08:40:28,800 --> 08:40:31,460
There's no way to farm anymore gold.

14462
08:40:31,920 --> 08:40:33,000
Oh my god.

14463
08:40:33,100 --> 08:40:36,320
I just found the last remaining gold block.

14464
08:40:36,840 --> 08:40:40,360
The final gold block that lives here.

14465
08:40:40,380 --> 08:40:41,980
The final gold block.

14466
08:40:48,280 --> 08:40:49,900
I'm gonna risk it.

14467
08:40:50,280 --> 08:40:51,400
No, I shouldn't.

14468
08:40:51,800 --> 08:40:54,360
This is way too risky even for me.

14469
08:40:58,880 --> 08:40:59,380
Oh,

14470
08:41:02,780 --> 08:41:04,580
I got seven Enderpearls now.

14471
08:41:05,340 --> 08:41:06,380
From all that?

14472
08:41:06,560 --> 08:41:07,620
From all of those?

14473
08:41:08,100 --> 08:41:09,260
Oh, I only got one.

14474
08:41:10,180 --> 08:41:10,440
Okay.

14475
08:41:10,880 --> 08:41:13,620
I was gonna say there was a lot of guys in that corner.

14476
08:41:14,280 --> 08:41:16,140
I hear the guys, but I can't get to them.

14477
08:41:16,740 --> 08:41:17,760
Safely, at least.

14478
08:41:17,760 --> 08:41:19,340
And there's a ghast.

14479
08:41:19,440 --> 08:41:20,840
Of course there is.

14480
08:41:21,380 --> 08:41:23,040
Oh, goodbye.

14481
08:41:23,300 --> 08:41:24,220
Okay, I have 18.

14482
08:41:25,220 --> 08:41:25,620
Goodbye.

14483
08:41:26,520 --> 08:41:28,900
Oh, I hear another ghast to my left.

14484
08:41:29,940 --> 08:41:31,260
Yeah, he's there.

14485
08:41:31,940 --> 08:41:33,340
We gotta leave this area.

14486
08:41:33,560 --> 08:41:35,040
There's this area.

14487
08:41:35,800 --> 08:41:37,140
No, ghast.

14488
08:41:37,160 --> 08:41:37,680
Was that you?

14489
08:41:37,880 --> 08:41:41,040
No, my crafting table.

14490
08:41:43,980 --> 08:41:45,560
This guy sucks.

14491
08:41:45,560 --> 08:41:46,880
This guy sucks so much.

14492
08:41:49,780 --> 08:41:53,760
And then he got my table.

14493
08:41:54,880 --> 08:41:56,820
He destroyed it.

14494
08:41:57,720 --> 08:42:01,080
Move to the left.

14495
08:42:01,700 --> 08:42:02,380
To the right.

14496
08:42:05,820 --> 08:42:06,860
Yeah,

14497
08:42:10,420 --> 08:42:10,860
I see you.

14498
08:42:11,640 --> 08:42:12,380
I'm going down.

14499
08:42:12,380 --> 08:42:13,620
What do we do?

14500
08:42:14,060 --> 08:42:17,060
I think we leave this cursed land.

14501
08:42:19,480 --> 08:42:21,840
We leave this cursed land.

14502
08:42:22,380 --> 08:42:24,800
I can hear all of them, I just can't see any of them.

14503
08:42:25,460 --> 08:42:26,300
For some reason.

14504
08:42:26,460 --> 08:42:27,920
Oh my gosh, there's another ghast.

14505
08:42:28,200 --> 08:42:28,840
How many?

14506
08:42:29,280 --> 08:42:30,840
Oh, there he is.

14507
08:42:32,300 --> 08:42:33,500
Why are they loud?

14508
08:42:34,280 --> 08:42:35,920
Oh my god, you're killing them.

14509
08:42:37,100 --> 08:42:37,880
There you go.

14510
08:42:37,940 --> 08:42:38,700
One of them is dead.

14511
08:42:39,840 --> 08:42:41,840
Are you getting arrows or are you getting...

14512
08:42:41,840 --> 08:42:42,580
Yeah, I mean...

14513
08:42:42,580 --> 08:42:45,480
I've been getting a lot.

14514
08:42:47,880 --> 08:42:49,540
Everything but obsidian.

14515
08:42:51,300 --> 08:42:53,080
Hey, whatever, that was work, I guess.

14516
08:42:53,300 --> 08:42:56,420
We need them for the fight, so...

14517
08:42:56,420 --> 08:42:57,740
Oh, thank you for the boots.

14518
08:42:59,720 --> 08:43:00,840
We have to leave.

14519
08:43:00,960 --> 08:43:01,600
We leave.

14520
08:43:02,440 --> 08:43:03,100
Oh, okay.

14521
08:43:03,320 --> 08:43:04,700
Alright, I think I can...

14522
08:43:04,700 --> 08:43:08,100
Thanks for the iron boots and the iron ingots, I guess.

14523
08:43:08,740 --> 08:43:09,140
I...

14524
08:43:11,360 --> 08:43:11,760
Okay.

14525
08:43:12,820 --> 08:43:13,680
I got it, guy.

14526
08:43:13,940 --> 08:43:14,900
I baited a guy.

14527
08:43:15,200 --> 08:43:17,360
Alright, time to make my other crafting table.

14528
08:43:17,380 --> 08:43:17,980
Come on, guy.

14529
08:43:19,340 --> 08:43:20,020
Where did he go?

14530
08:43:20,860 --> 08:43:22,640
Oh, what did I want to make again?

14531
08:43:22,820 --> 08:43:24,340
Oh my god, diamond pickaxe.

14532
08:43:24,600 --> 08:43:24,780
Come back.

14533
08:43:25,080 --> 08:43:26,000
Come back, please.

14534
08:43:26,840 --> 08:43:27,680
Come back, please.

14535
08:43:31,200 --> 08:43:32,780
Oh my god, it's almost 2AM!

14536
08:43:33,520 --> 08:43:34,320
No way.

14537
08:43:34,480 --> 08:43:35,680
We can do this.

14538
08:43:35,920 --> 08:43:37,240
I believe in us.

14539
08:43:37,980 --> 08:43:40,160
We can do this.

14540
08:43:40,900 --> 08:43:42,740
We can do this.

14541
08:43:45,320 --> 08:43:46,580
Oh, there's another one?

14542
08:43:48,120 --> 08:43:49,220
The other angry?

14543
08:43:50,820 --> 08:43:52,040
What do I not need?

14544
08:43:52,120 --> 08:43:54,220
You want my stuff, little boy?

14545
08:43:54,840 --> 08:43:56,540
You want my little water bottle?

14546
08:43:57,140 --> 08:43:58,600
You want that, little boy?

14547
08:43:58,740 --> 08:43:59,200
Here, take it.

14548
08:44:00,360 --> 08:44:01,140
Take it.

14549
08:44:01,920 --> 08:44:05,100
Oh, why are you still here?

14550
08:44:05,100 --> 08:44:07,080
Why are you still...

14551
08:44:07,080 --> 08:44:08,100
We gotta leave.

14552
08:44:08,460 --> 08:44:09,620
Oh, here we go.

14553
08:44:10,020 --> 08:44:10,420
Oh my god.

14554
08:44:14,480 --> 08:44:16,540
Oh my gosh, this is like an ender farm.

14555
08:44:20,700 --> 08:44:22,740
This is like an ender farm!

14556
08:44:27,100 --> 08:44:29,300
Oh my god, this is kind of awesome.

14557
08:44:29,680 --> 08:44:31,160
Yeah, I found a little hole.

14558
08:44:33,180 --> 08:44:35,360
I just hit them all at once.

14559
08:44:36,660 --> 08:44:39,460
Okay, I only got two pearls from that, but you know, great.

14560
08:44:39,660 --> 08:44:40,120
That's good.

14561
08:44:40,180 --> 08:44:40,980
Alright, let's leave.

14562
08:44:41,360 --> 08:44:41,840
Oh, hold on.

14563
08:44:42,100 --> 08:44:42,500
Come here.

14564
08:44:43,500 --> 08:44:45,240
There's three more over there.

14565
08:44:49,680 --> 08:44:50,760
Did I just hear you?

14566
08:44:52,160 --> 08:44:52,620
Yes.

14567
08:44:53,060 --> 08:44:53,540
Oh, hi.

14568
08:44:54,940 --> 08:44:55,940
Where do you wanna go?

14569
08:44:56,460 --> 08:44:57,480
I don't know.

14570
08:44:57,880 --> 08:44:58,440
You pick.

14571
08:44:58,820 --> 08:45:01,000
I don't know, I've been here so long.

14572
08:45:02,400 --> 08:45:05,200
I've been trading for gold non-stop.

14573
08:45:05,380 --> 08:45:07,370
Like, I don't know anymore.

14574
08:45:07,370 --> 08:45:07,730
I don't know anymore.

14575
08:45:08,230 --> 08:45:12,170
Okay, I have another concern because we're gonna run out of food.

14576
08:45:12,490 --> 08:45:13,970
No, I have a lot of hay.

14577
08:45:14,650 --> 08:45:15,030
You do?

14578
08:45:15,230 --> 08:45:16,270
Yeah, I have 20 more.

14579
08:45:17,850 --> 08:45:19,130
That's a lot.

14580
08:45:20,190 --> 08:45:21,090
Like hay bales?

14581
08:45:21,250 --> 08:45:21,510
Yeah.

14582
08:45:22,450 --> 08:45:23,890
I have 20 more.

14583
08:45:24,050 --> 08:45:27,130
I have 20 more hay bales!

14584
08:45:27,410 --> 08:45:28,090
Let's go!

14585
08:45:31,020 --> 08:45:32,400
I have melons?

14586
08:45:32,600 --> 08:45:34,800
Oh, I have 64 melons.

14587
08:45:34,940 --> 08:45:35,760
Okay, we're good.

14588
08:45:35,760 --> 08:45:37,660
I have a full stack of melons.

14589
08:45:37,700 --> 08:45:38,660
I didn't even notice them.

14590
08:45:39,420 --> 08:45:40,040
Let's go.

14591
08:45:41,000 --> 08:45:42,440
Do we wanna just go this way?

14592
08:45:42,520 --> 08:45:43,380
Alright, let's go.

14593
08:45:43,820 --> 08:45:45,880
We gotta get some gold somewhere.

14594
08:45:47,080 --> 08:45:48,540
Maybe we'll get more here.

14595
08:45:48,640 --> 08:45:49,160
Who knows?

14596
08:45:49,420 --> 08:45:51,940
Somewhere out there...

14597
08:45:51,940 --> 08:45:53,680
Beneath the...

14598
08:45:54,900 --> 08:45:56,320
What is that song?

14599
08:45:56,680 --> 08:45:58,540
It's from An American Tale.

14600
08:45:59,280 --> 08:46:00,600
The one about the mouse.

14601
08:46:01,380 --> 08:46:03,720
The one with the naked lady in the window, right?

14602
08:46:03,720 --> 08:46:05,240
There are no cats in America.

14603
08:46:07,320 --> 08:46:10,040
There are no cats in America.

14604
08:46:11,300 --> 08:46:12,900
I don't know why I like...

14605
08:46:12,900 --> 08:46:14,360
That would suck if there was no cats in America.

14606
08:46:14,540 --> 08:46:17,060
I was really upset about that actually.

14607
08:46:17,700 --> 08:46:18,700
It's a terrible song.

14608
08:46:18,840 --> 08:46:19,640
I hate these cats.

14609
08:46:19,800 --> 08:46:20,500
Or these mice.

14610
08:46:20,820 --> 08:46:21,640
You know what?

14611
08:46:22,040 --> 08:46:23,660
They can get eaten by the cats.

14612
08:46:23,860 --> 08:46:24,820
All for all I care.

14613
08:46:26,900 --> 08:46:29,800
The mice are supposed to represent the American dream.

14614
08:46:33,720 --> 08:46:35,420
They're talking about no cats.

14615
08:46:35,760 --> 08:46:37,620
The cats are eating the mice.

14616
08:46:38,020 --> 08:46:39,860
The cats are the more important part.

14617
08:46:40,780 --> 08:46:41,940
Cats are cuter than mice.

14618
08:46:42,360 --> 08:46:42,500
Woah.

14619
08:46:43,520 --> 08:46:45,800
That's some cat propaganda right there.

14620
08:46:46,900 --> 08:46:47,420
Sorry.

14621
08:46:50,700 --> 08:46:53,080
Why are you not like just mining the straight line?

14622
08:46:53,340 --> 08:46:55,660
Oh, the naked lady is in the...

14623
08:46:55,660 --> 08:46:57,540
Oh no, the naked lady is on the...

14624
08:46:57,540 --> 08:46:58,960
Is in the Disney movie.

14625
08:47:00,120 --> 08:47:01,740
Yeah, the one frame where they're naked.

14626
08:47:02,220 --> 08:47:02,960
Yeah, yeah.

14627
08:47:03,100 --> 08:47:04,280
Oh, just go on a straight line?

14628
08:47:04,380 --> 08:47:04,800
Okay, okay.

14629
08:47:04,820 --> 08:47:07,920
Why are you doing the netherite mining?

14630
08:47:09,100 --> 08:47:10,420
Yeah, that's the netherite mine.

14631
08:47:10,920 --> 08:47:11,420
Is it really?

14632
08:47:11,660 --> 08:47:14,520
Yeah, the way you were mining, that's how you mine for netherite.

14633
08:47:14,740 --> 08:47:16,720
Well, that's how I got to netherite, baby.

14634
08:47:16,920 --> 08:47:17,980
Yeah, and not the gold.

14635
08:47:18,680 --> 08:47:20,300
I've tried for the gold.

14636
08:47:22,180 --> 08:47:23,900
But I also was just trying to...

14637
08:47:25,260 --> 08:47:26,640
Bye, this is where my...

14638
08:47:26,640 --> 08:47:27,280
Are you mining?

14639
08:47:28,700 --> 08:47:29,500
Oh my...

14640
08:47:29,500 --> 08:47:30,880
I thought that was mine that was breaking.

14641
08:47:32,020 --> 08:47:33,360
No, mine broke.

14642
08:47:34,340 --> 08:47:36,440
I've just been making iron ones.

14643
08:47:37,320 --> 08:47:38,720
Because I don't want to use my diamond.

14644
08:47:39,100 --> 08:47:40,120
But now I have to.

14645
08:47:41,260 --> 08:47:43,140
It's too late.

14646
08:47:43,440 --> 08:47:44,340
You have to.

14647
08:47:45,640 --> 08:47:46,540
But it's precious.

14648
08:47:46,920 --> 08:47:48,040
It's precious material.

14649
08:47:48,520 --> 08:47:50,280
I had another one.

14650
08:47:53,840 --> 08:47:54,880
Was that...

14651
08:47:54,880 --> 08:47:56,220
That has to be an ender, right?

14652
08:47:56,980 --> 08:47:57,380
What?

14653
08:47:58,020 --> 08:47:58,480
The enderman?

14654
08:47:59,020 --> 08:48:01,120
No, I think that was just cave ambiance.

14655
08:48:02,100 --> 08:48:03,320
How deep is this hole?

14656
08:48:04,160 --> 08:48:06,240
How deep is this hole and how is there no gold?

14657
08:48:07,360 --> 08:48:08,640
See, that's what I'm saying.

14658
08:48:09,040 --> 08:48:09,880
How is there no gold?

14659
08:48:10,720 --> 08:48:11,300
I don't know.

14660
08:48:11,480 --> 08:48:12,300
Do you need iron?

14661
08:48:12,420 --> 08:48:13,100
I have iron.

14662
08:48:13,920 --> 08:48:14,460
Oh, you do?

14663
08:48:15,500 --> 08:48:17,520
I shouldn't have just one iron.

14664
08:48:17,800 --> 08:48:18,600
Here, take it all.

14665
08:48:20,060 --> 08:48:21,500
Take all the iron.

14666
08:48:21,500 --> 08:48:21,620
Take all the iron.

14667
08:48:23,640 --> 08:48:26,280
Yeah, I kept the iron instead of the enderpearl.

14668
08:48:36,140 --> 08:48:37,980
I'm just going to mine a straight line.

14669
08:48:38,180 --> 08:48:40,200
I'm not doing two anymore.

14670
08:48:40,460 --> 08:48:42,620
I'm not doing two anymore.

14671
08:48:43,260 --> 08:48:44,600
We're just going to go in a straight line.

14672
08:48:44,600 --> 08:48:45,320
I'll do the other side.

14673
08:48:46,300 --> 08:48:47,640
I got to the...

14674
08:48:50,240 --> 08:48:52,620
Oh, I see more.

14675
08:48:53,580 --> 08:48:55,040
I see more gold.

14676
08:48:55,720 --> 08:48:57,400
I see more gold.

14677
08:48:58,060 --> 08:48:58,800
There's more gold.

14678
08:48:58,800 --> 08:48:59,440
More gold for you.

14679
08:49:00,120 --> 08:49:01,960
More gold for you.

14680
08:49:02,300 --> 08:49:04,300
I see the gold.

14681
08:49:04,680 --> 08:49:05,400
She sees the gold.

14682
08:49:05,740 --> 08:49:06,580
She sees the gold.

14683
08:49:08,180 --> 08:49:10,060
Every gold is a gold.

14684
08:49:12,520 --> 08:49:14,140
The gold is the gold.

14685
08:49:14,220 --> 08:49:17,100
Maybe we should just slowly head back to our...

14686
08:49:17,100 --> 08:49:19,600
original spawn while we're trying to find gold.

14687
08:49:19,940 --> 08:49:20,700
It's like, who...

14688
08:49:20,700 --> 08:49:21,780
What are we going to get first?

14689
08:49:21,780 --> 08:49:23,600
Our original spawn point?

14690
08:49:24,420 --> 08:49:24,880
Or...

14691
08:49:24,880 --> 08:49:26,020
The gold?

14692
08:49:26,460 --> 08:49:28,780
At this rate, we would've been back.

14693
08:49:29,140 --> 08:49:31,040
We would've made it back.

14694
08:49:31,120 --> 08:49:33,260
I think we would've actually been back.

14695
08:49:33,660 --> 08:49:36,920
I honestly think...

14696
08:49:36,920 --> 08:49:38,700
I think we would've made it back.

14697
08:49:42,580 --> 08:49:44,820
Well, we're going the opposite direction.

14698
08:49:45,740 --> 08:49:48,080
Alright, which direction is the gold?

14699
08:49:48,080 --> 08:49:48,140
The gold.

14700
08:49:51,380 --> 08:49:52,520
Not gold, sorry.

14701
08:49:52,820 --> 08:49:53,800
Oh, no.

14702
08:50:00,070 --> 08:50:01,110
Lead the way.

14703
08:50:01,230 --> 08:50:02,710
Let's just slowly head back.

14704
08:50:02,830 --> 08:50:04,190
Let's see what we get first.

14705
08:50:04,650 --> 08:50:07,190
We need to literally go the opposite way...

14706
08:50:07,190 --> 08:50:08,670
that we just came from.

14707
08:50:09,230 --> 08:50:10,430
Alright, here we go.

14708
08:50:10,630 --> 08:50:11,270
Let's go.

14709
08:50:12,650 --> 08:50:13,250
Yippee!

14710
08:50:13,770 --> 08:50:14,530
Let's go!

14711
08:50:14,790 --> 08:50:16,190
I'm going to follow you.

14712
08:50:16,750 --> 08:50:18,170
You aggroed a guy?

14713
08:50:18,170 --> 08:50:19,230
Or I did.

14714
08:50:19,410 --> 08:50:19,970
I don't think so.

14715
08:50:20,070 --> 08:50:20,590
Did I aggro?

14716
08:50:20,610 --> 08:50:23,030
No, you did because I wasn't looking at anything.

14717
08:50:23,430 --> 08:50:24,570
Oh, I was on...

14718
08:50:25,210 --> 08:50:26,430
Looking at the coordinates.

14719
08:50:27,310 --> 08:50:28,150
My bad.

14720
08:50:28,690 --> 08:50:30,230
I was literally placing blocks.

14721
08:50:33,590 --> 08:50:34,210
Come on.

14722
08:50:35,270 --> 08:50:36,530
Are we not heading back?

14723
08:50:36,550 --> 08:50:39,450
I'm worried I'm going to fall.

14724
08:50:40,590 --> 08:50:42,270
Okay, I'm going to dig while you do that.

14725
08:50:42,610 --> 08:50:43,290
And look for gold.

14726
08:50:44,310 --> 08:50:44,910
Alright, which way?

14727
08:50:44,910 --> 08:50:46,310
Which way is the original way?

14728
08:50:46,490 --> 08:50:47,230
This way!

14729
08:50:47,930 --> 08:50:50,150
Our smile and optimism gone.

14730
08:50:52,430 --> 08:50:54,150
We have to also...

14731
08:50:54,150 --> 08:50:54,630
Hold on.

14732
08:50:55,910 --> 08:50:59,010
It's more like this way.

14733
08:50:59,470 --> 08:51:00,350
Negative Z.

14734
08:51:00,850 --> 08:51:03,170
We gotta go facing north.

14735
08:51:03,510 --> 08:51:04,750
So we gotta go like this way.

14736
08:51:05,470 --> 08:51:06,030
This way?

14737
08:51:06,330 --> 08:51:07,170
Like a diagonal.

14738
08:51:08,210 --> 08:51:11,050
So that's why the diagonal dig is good.

14739
08:51:12,050 --> 08:51:13,230
Do the diagonal dig.

14740
08:51:13,230 --> 08:51:14,670
Do the diagonal dig.

14741
08:51:14,690 --> 08:51:15,730
What if I hit lava?

14742
08:51:16,470 --> 08:51:19,210
Then stand far away when you do the diagonal dig.

14743
08:51:19,810 --> 08:51:21,230
I wonder if I'm stupid.

14744
08:51:22,030 --> 08:51:22,790
Do you want me to dig?

14745
08:51:23,510 --> 08:51:23,950
No.

14746
08:51:25,430 --> 08:51:26,510
Actually, no, yeah.

14747
08:51:27,490 --> 08:51:27,930
Okay.

14748
08:51:29,710 --> 08:51:30,950
I'm gonna be slower though.

14749
08:51:31,030 --> 08:51:31,950
I don't have a diamond pick.

14750
08:51:32,930 --> 08:51:35,250
I'm gonna...It's just like 1% slower.

14751
08:51:36,470 --> 08:51:37,550
It's just 1%.

14752
08:51:37,550 --> 08:51:39,090
I'm just gonna sit here for a little bit.

14753
08:51:39,910 --> 08:51:40,310
Okay.

14754
08:51:43,550 --> 08:51:44,290
I'll just...

14755
08:51:44,990 --> 08:51:45,770
I'll just dig.

14756
08:51:46,810 --> 08:51:48,790
I'll just be the supervisor.

14757
08:51:49,370 --> 08:51:50,230
I'll be the...

14758
08:51:50,810 --> 08:51:51,650
I'll be the supervisor.

14759
08:51:51,650 --> 08:51:53,830
How am I doing, sir?

14760
08:51:54,370 --> 08:51:55,050
It's alright.

14761
08:51:55,590 --> 08:51:56,490
I mean, it could be better.

14762
08:51:56,970 --> 08:51:58,250
You know, you could put better form.

14763
08:51:58,430 --> 08:51:59,330
Your back could be more straight.

14764
08:52:01,410 --> 08:52:02,350
What's gonna happen?

14765
08:52:02,450 --> 08:52:03,410
Nothing's gonna spawn.

14766
08:52:04,030 --> 08:52:05,230
No, but I can't see.

14767
08:52:05,230 --> 08:52:06,190
You can't see?

14768
08:52:06,570 --> 08:52:07,490
I can't...

14769
08:52:08,170 --> 08:52:10,770
You don't have the right resource pack.

14770
08:52:12,050 --> 08:52:14,070
I have the shaders on.

14771
08:52:16,250 --> 08:52:17,130
Oh my god.

14772
08:52:18,750 --> 08:52:20,050
You got this.

14773
08:52:20,310 --> 08:52:20,990
Why are you tired?

14774
08:52:21,870 --> 08:52:23,630
It's 2 AM for me.

14775
08:52:23,750 --> 08:52:27,510
This is literally so past my bedtime.

14776
08:52:30,460 --> 08:52:32,640
I told you it took them 20 days.

14777
08:52:32,760 --> 08:52:33,860
And then we had one day.

14778
08:52:33,860 --> 08:52:34,560
We...

14779
08:52:35,320 --> 08:52:36,780
Get your gamer subs out.

14780
08:52:36,860 --> 08:52:38,260
I got my gamer subs out.

14781
08:52:38,340 --> 08:52:40,360
I had the gamer subs earlier.

14782
08:52:41,180 --> 08:52:42,440
By the way, guys.

14783
08:52:42,920 --> 08:52:44,360
You use our code...

14784
08:52:44,360 --> 08:52:45,500
Code DokiBird.

14785
08:52:46,400 --> 08:52:48,940
You can get 10% off.

14786
08:52:50,400 --> 08:52:52,640
My code will get you more percentage off.

14787
08:52:53,460 --> 08:52:54,100
I can't see.

14788
08:52:55,000 --> 08:52:55,260
What?

14789
08:52:56,800 --> 08:52:57,980
Okay, you need a torch.

14790
08:52:58,840 --> 08:52:59,860
I couldn't see.

14791
08:52:59,860 --> 08:52:59,920
I couldn't see.

14792
08:53:02,200 --> 08:53:04,240
Why is there no gold in here?

14793
08:53:04,640 --> 08:53:05,960
I think we're not in the right...

14794
08:53:07,060 --> 08:53:09,580
Alright, get out.

14795
08:53:10,000 --> 08:53:10,800
It's my turn.

14796
08:53:11,220 --> 08:53:13,580
Hold on, I'll make a new one and then I'll take over.

14797
08:53:15,960 --> 08:53:16,960
Oh, off-handed?

14798
08:53:17,260 --> 08:53:17,720
Oh, true.

14799
08:53:18,320 --> 08:53:20,520
It's off-handed, that's what I've been doing.

14800
08:53:21,460 --> 08:53:22,980
Well, other than the shield part.

14801
08:53:23,520 --> 08:53:23,860
Yeah.

14802
08:53:26,780 --> 08:53:28,040
Are we heading the right way?

14803
08:53:30,740 --> 08:53:32,600
Have you checked at all?

14804
08:53:32,640 --> 08:53:33,940
Yeah, we're heading the right way.

14805
08:53:33,960 --> 08:53:34,760
Okay, thank God.

14806
08:53:34,900 --> 08:53:36,240
I just have to be sure.

14807
08:53:36,280 --> 08:53:38,700
We just need to get over a thousand...

14808
08:53:40,620 --> 08:53:41,660
Z and...

14809
08:53:41,660 --> 08:53:43,220
2,000 X.

14810
08:53:44,360 --> 08:53:45,520
Okay, we're at the edge.

14811
08:53:45,520 --> 08:53:48,100
We're also searching for gold so that we can...

14812
08:53:48,520 --> 08:53:50,320
Oh my God.

14813
08:53:51,780 --> 08:53:52,560
What's happening?

14814
08:53:53,420 --> 08:53:54,660
Don't take down.

14815
08:53:56,660 --> 08:53:57,010
Don't...

14816
08:53:59,480 --> 08:54:00,680
Wait, is there lava?

14817
08:54:01,460 --> 08:54:02,120
Boat time.

14818
08:54:02,920 --> 08:54:04,140
Oh yeah, actually we could...

14819
08:54:04,140 --> 08:54:05,420
I heard a gas though.

14820
08:54:06,280 --> 08:54:07,520
Boat time!

14821
08:54:07,720 --> 08:54:10,200
She doesn't care anymore.

14822
08:54:10,540 --> 08:54:11,720
Boat time!

14823
08:54:12,120 --> 08:54:12,940
Let's go!

14824
08:54:16,840 --> 08:54:17,540
Yay!

14825
08:54:17,820 --> 08:54:19,320
Thank God.

14826
08:54:20,180 --> 08:54:21,120
I got my...

14827
08:54:21,120 --> 08:54:23,680
Boat time, it really feels like the next time we will miss.

14828
08:54:26,320 --> 08:54:27,200
Goodbye boat!

14829
08:54:28,400 --> 08:54:29,620
Why does the Enderman scream?

14830
08:54:30,240 --> 08:54:30,620
Hold on.

14831
08:54:30,720 --> 08:54:31,380
Oh my God, wait.

14832
08:54:33,080 --> 08:54:34,660
Did you aggro?

14833
08:54:34,960 --> 08:54:35,900
I didn't aggro anybody.

14834
08:54:36,420 --> 08:54:38,180
I think it's the guy from before.

14835
08:54:38,820 --> 08:54:40,300
Did you aggro?

14836
08:54:40,960 --> 08:54:42,240
Did you do it?

14837
08:54:42,260 --> 08:54:44,140
No, I think it's the guy who followed us.

14838
08:54:44,180 --> 08:54:45,460
Did you do it?

14839
08:54:45,840 --> 08:54:47,940
Did you aggro?

14840
08:54:47,940 --> 08:54:49,960
I did, but earlier.

14841
08:54:50,420 --> 08:54:52,160
He followed me all the way here.

14842
08:54:53,020 --> 08:54:54,000
I think it'll be fine.

14843
08:54:54,160 --> 08:54:55,340
Just come down here.

14844
08:54:55,580 --> 08:54:56,580
No, he's gonna get me.

14845
08:54:56,700 --> 08:54:59,000
He's not gonna get you.

14846
08:55:00,680 --> 08:55:01,980
He's not gonna get you.

14847
08:55:02,060 --> 08:55:03,220
You're being paranoid.

14848
08:55:04,060 --> 08:55:05,260
I hear him right there!

14849
08:55:05,280 --> 08:55:06,660
You're getting paranoid.

14850
08:55:07,880 --> 08:55:10,000
I'm gonna dig for gold while he's...

14851
08:55:10,000 --> 08:55:11,400
Until he comes to see me.

14852
08:55:11,400 --> 08:55:13,020
You're getting paranoid.

14853
08:55:13,140 --> 08:55:14,120
How am I paranoid?

14854
08:55:14,280 --> 08:55:16,240
I almost died to Enderman earlier.

14855
08:55:16,240 --> 08:55:17,940
You're getting paranoid.

14856
08:55:18,740 --> 08:55:20,380
You're hearing the voices again.

14857
08:55:21,200 --> 08:55:22,320
What are you talking about?

14858
08:55:22,440 --> 08:55:23,560
He's right there!

14859
08:55:23,700 --> 08:55:24,960
He's not angry.

14860
08:55:25,200 --> 08:55:26,000
Which one?

14861
08:55:26,460 --> 08:55:27,920
I hear him screaming.

14862
08:55:28,260 --> 08:55:28,620
Oh my God.

14863
08:55:29,240 --> 08:55:30,360
Where are you?

14864
08:55:31,300 --> 08:55:32,220
I'm up here.

14865
08:55:32,400 --> 08:55:34,580
I hid as soon as I heard him screaming at me.

14866
08:55:34,800 --> 08:55:36,040
There's nobody screaming.

14867
08:55:36,580 --> 08:55:37,720
There's no one screaming.

14868
08:55:37,840 --> 08:55:38,700
There's nobody screaming.

14869
08:55:39,260 --> 08:55:40,800
You guys, you hear it.

14870
08:55:40,840 --> 08:55:42,100
He's underneath me.

14871
08:55:42,780 --> 08:55:44,000
Nobody is screaming.

14872
08:55:44,000 --> 08:55:45,720
I'm literally...

14873
08:55:45,720 --> 08:55:47,100
No one is getting you.

14874
08:55:47,180 --> 08:55:48,220
But you're paranoid.

14875
08:55:53,020 --> 08:55:54,800
Oh, I see.

14876
08:55:54,900 --> 08:55:55,360
Never mind.

14877
08:55:55,440 --> 08:55:56,200
I see him now.

14878
08:55:57,800 --> 08:56:00,000
He was literally right...

14879
08:56:00,960 --> 08:56:01,180
Right...

14880
08:56:01,180 --> 08:56:03,000
He is vibrating.

14881
08:56:03,640 --> 08:56:04,200
I know!

14882
08:56:04,780 --> 08:56:05,860
I hear him!

14883
08:56:06,140 --> 08:56:07,580
What did you do to him?

14884
08:56:07,580 --> 08:56:08,300
Don't stop!

14885
08:56:08,460 --> 08:56:08,460
Stop!

14886
08:56:08,520 --> 08:56:10,000
You're wasting your arrows!

14887
08:56:10,620 --> 08:56:11,100
He'll dodge.

14888
08:56:14,100 --> 08:56:15,880
I know, I wanted him to TP.

14889
08:56:17,120 --> 08:56:18,560
Oh, you wanted him to TP.

14890
08:56:20,200 --> 08:56:21,020
Hey, buddy!

14891
08:56:23,180 --> 08:56:24,080
Hey, buddy!

14892
08:56:27,180 --> 08:56:28,340
Why don't you kill him?

14893
08:56:28,880 --> 08:56:29,240
You're right there.

14894
08:56:29,260 --> 08:56:30,600
I'm trying to make the house!

14895
08:56:31,280 --> 08:56:31,740
Oh, okay.

14896
08:56:33,920 --> 08:56:35,120
Just right above your head.

14897
08:56:35,640 --> 08:56:35,940
Okay.

14898
08:56:37,560 --> 08:56:39,900
There's three Endermans right here.

14899
08:56:40,240 --> 08:56:40,720
There's...

14900
08:56:40,720 --> 08:56:43,360
We'll just kill the one that's aggro on me.

14901
08:56:43,600 --> 08:56:44,760
There's so many!

14902
08:56:44,980 --> 08:56:45,500
There's four!

14903
08:56:47,040 --> 08:56:48,480
Okay, but you're in the house.

14904
08:56:48,580 --> 08:56:49,220
You're safe.

14905
08:56:49,600 --> 08:56:52,100
I don't know if I made it correctly.

14906
08:56:52,680 --> 08:56:53,420
Come down here.

14907
08:56:55,580 --> 08:56:56,780
I see him.

14908
08:56:57,540 --> 08:56:58,100
I see him.

14909
08:56:58,440 --> 08:56:59,200
I got him.

14910
08:56:59,560 --> 08:57:00,380
He's dead.

14911
08:57:01,700 --> 08:57:02,480
He's dead.

14912
08:57:03,120 --> 08:57:03,600
Okay.

14913
08:57:04,700 --> 08:57:06,460
I don't hear him screaming at me anymore.

14914
08:57:06,620 --> 08:57:07,440
Alright, I'm coming down.

14915
08:57:07,440 --> 08:57:10,580
Alright, we can kill all these other Endermans in this house I made.

14916
08:57:10,920 --> 08:57:11,940
Yeah, come here.

14917
08:57:13,000 --> 08:57:13,760
Oh my God.

14918
08:57:15,600 --> 08:57:16,800
Nice house, I think.

14919
08:57:16,920 --> 08:57:18,480
He like brought the whole crew.

14920
08:57:18,640 --> 08:57:19,960
What was I supposed to do?

14921
08:57:21,360 --> 08:57:22,560
Okay, I killed one.

14922
08:57:23,240 --> 08:57:24,340
There's another one right here.

14923
08:57:25,320 --> 08:57:27,940
I'm literally looking at...

14924
08:57:29,680 --> 08:57:30,720
Get under the house!

14925
08:57:31,060 --> 08:57:31,800
I am!

14926
08:57:32,780 --> 08:57:33,660
Further, further!

14927
08:57:33,660 --> 08:57:35,040
What's he gonna do?

14928
08:57:35,220 --> 08:57:35,600
Hit me?

14929
08:57:37,420 --> 08:57:38,900
Alright, there's the other one.

14930
08:57:39,420 --> 08:57:41,500
Okay, that should be...

14931
08:57:41,500 --> 08:57:42,580
Right here!

14932
08:57:42,740 --> 08:57:43,740
I'm looking at the other one!

14933
08:57:45,640 --> 08:57:46,860
There he is!

14934
08:57:47,280 --> 08:57:48,640
He's coming, he's coming!

14935
08:57:49,460 --> 08:57:50,520
Where is he going?

14936
08:57:51,740 --> 08:57:53,300
Oh, there he is.

14937
08:57:55,260 --> 08:57:57,720
I told you he brought the whole crew!

14938
08:57:59,600 --> 08:58:01,400
I'm getting him!

14939
08:58:01,400 --> 08:58:02,320
Oh, there's the boat.

14940
08:58:03,600 --> 08:58:05,060
I saw the boat in the tree.

14941
08:58:05,560 --> 08:58:05,880
Yeah, I know.

14942
08:58:06,000 --> 08:58:06,720
I said there's the boat.

14943
08:58:07,580 --> 08:58:09,420
Oh, is he gonna come back?

14944
08:58:10,140 --> 08:58:11,560
I don't know, but I got the boat.

14945
08:58:12,260 --> 08:58:13,000
Hello, Enderman!

14946
08:58:13,340 --> 08:58:14,300
Hello, where did he go?

14947
08:58:14,900 --> 08:58:15,220
Oh.

14948
08:58:17,580 --> 08:58:18,380
He disappeared.

14949
08:58:23,240 --> 08:58:24,100
Oh my God.

14950
08:58:25,440 --> 08:58:26,740
Okay, that works too, I guess.

14951
08:58:29,260 --> 08:58:30,160
That works too.

14952
08:58:30,680 --> 08:58:32,360
I told you to get under the house.

14953
08:58:32,480 --> 08:58:33,420
I am trying!

14954
08:58:36,280 --> 08:58:37,660
I'm trying my best.

14955
08:58:37,940 --> 08:58:39,660
High five, high five Enderpearls.

14956
08:58:40,000 --> 08:58:41,560
My shield, I'll be okay.

14957
08:58:42,440 --> 08:58:43,240
Alright, let's...

14958
08:58:43,240 --> 08:58:46,100
Alright, tell me how to...

14959
08:58:46,100 --> 08:58:46,600
Where do we go?

14960
08:58:46,680 --> 08:58:48,040
How do we get to the other side?

14961
08:58:48,800 --> 08:58:49,580
Is it to the forest?

14962
08:58:49,580 --> 08:58:50,680
Just keep heading north.

14963
08:58:51,940 --> 08:58:53,460
Yeah, we gotta go into those woods.

14964
08:58:53,980 --> 08:58:55,520
Back to the woods we go.

14965
08:58:55,620 --> 08:58:56,420
Into the thick of it.

14966
08:58:56,420 --> 08:58:57,840
Into the thick of it.

14967
08:58:58,260 --> 08:58:59,460
Into the thick of it.

14968
08:58:59,840 --> 08:59:01,900
There was one guy I still hadn't killed though.

14969
08:59:02,460 --> 08:59:04,180
It's fine, it's fine.

14970
08:59:04,460 --> 08:59:07,480
Maybe he'll... He's not gonna get revenge on us, right?

14971
08:59:08,320 --> 08:59:09,220
Where are my mushrooms?

14972
08:59:09,340 --> 08:59:10,980
I don't have any mushrooms, by the way.

14973
08:59:11,060 --> 08:59:11,980
I have mushrooms, I have mushrooms.

14974
08:59:11,980 --> 08:59:13,040
I have zero mushrooms.

14975
08:59:13,140 --> 08:59:15,280
Wait, we're literally in mushroom territory.

14976
08:59:15,460 --> 08:59:16,200
Collect some, collect some.

14977
08:59:16,220 --> 08:59:17,520
I know, I know, I know.

14978
08:59:17,680 --> 08:59:18,820
I need to find some.

14979
08:59:19,660 --> 08:59:20,840
Turn around, over here.

14980
08:59:20,920 --> 08:59:21,580
Yeah, yeah, over here.

14981
08:59:23,360 --> 08:59:24,020
In here.

14982
08:59:24,960 --> 08:59:26,580
I found it, I found it, I found it.

14983
08:59:27,180 --> 08:59:28,320
But not the red ones.

14984
08:59:28,440 --> 08:59:29,300
You gotta get the blue ones.

14985
08:59:29,360 --> 08:59:31,060
I know, I need to figure out what to throw away.

14986
08:59:31,700 --> 08:59:32,840
Into the thick of it.

14987
08:59:33,100 --> 08:59:33,980
Into the thick of it.

14988
08:59:35,080 --> 08:59:37,320
Here, I'll collect some and then I can give you like half or something.

14989
08:59:37,340 --> 08:59:38,300
No, it's fine, I got two.

14990
08:59:38,760 --> 08:59:40,000
I got five, I got five.

14991
08:59:40,120 --> 08:59:40,860
I got enough.

14992
08:59:41,460 --> 08:59:42,320
Alright, let's go.

14993
08:59:43,520 --> 08:59:45,120
I have... 15.

14994
08:59:46,060 --> 08:59:48,600
Alright, that's... I think that's way too much, but that's okay.

14995
08:59:49,720 --> 08:59:50,080
What?!

14996
08:59:50,080 --> 08:59:51,880
Oh, now I'm being...

14997
08:59:51,880 --> 08:59:54,150
Now I'm being punished for being over prepared.

14998
09:00:00,540 --> 09:00:02,020
Alright, do we just go straight?

14999
09:00:02,120 --> 09:00:02,660
Is that it?

15000
09:00:03,160 --> 09:00:04,180
Wait, where did you go?

15001
09:00:05,220 --> 09:00:05,980
Oh, there you are.

15002
09:00:06,040 --> 09:00:06,880
I'm in the forest.

15003
09:00:07,880 --> 09:00:08,420
Oh, I see you.

15004
09:00:10,020 --> 09:00:11,920
How did you get... Oh, you went that way.

15005
09:00:12,000 --> 09:00:12,360
That's right.

15006
09:00:13,120 --> 09:00:13,820
You're waiting.

15007
09:00:15,700 --> 09:00:16,920
Into the thick of it.

15008
09:00:16,920 --> 09:00:19,040
I wish we could've obtained that strider.

15009
09:00:19,220 --> 09:00:20,680
Oh, I should've got a saddle.

15010
09:00:20,820 --> 09:00:22,360
And then we could've just walked through the lava.

15011
09:00:22,900 --> 09:00:25,960
We could've just walked through the lava until we got to our place.

15012
09:00:26,080 --> 09:00:27,140
We could've...

15013
09:00:30,520 --> 09:00:33,880
But then the ghast would see us in the middle and blow us up.

15014
09:00:34,700 --> 09:00:35,980
Is it just straight?

15015
09:00:37,960 --> 09:00:38,960
It's more like...

15016
09:00:41,020 --> 09:00:43,060
Hold on, I have to check when I move.

15017
09:00:45,820 --> 09:00:46,420
Wait.

15018
09:00:48,480 --> 09:00:49,080
Huh?

15019
09:00:49,540 --> 09:00:51,380
There's like four of them right below me.

15020
09:00:52,420 --> 09:00:54,340
Wait, but X is going up.

15021
09:00:55,720 --> 09:00:57,140
Okay, no, it is straight.

15022
09:00:57,280 --> 09:00:59,220
Okay, I was gonna...

15023
09:00:59,220 --> 09:01:00,280
Yeah, let's just go straight.

15024
09:01:01,000 --> 09:01:01,220
Okay.

15025
09:01:04,560 --> 09:01:06,880
Just follow my one side bridge.

15026
09:01:06,960 --> 09:01:08,320
My one block bridge.

15027
09:01:08,580 --> 09:01:11,220
My one block bridge right here.

15028
09:01:12,540 --> 09:01:14,280
Into the thick of it.

15029
09:01:14,800 --> 09:01:16,060
Into the thick of it.

15030
09:01:16,540 --> 09:01:17,760
Into the thick of it.

15031
09:01:19,600 --> 09:01:21,040
Any gold around us?

15032
09:01:21,120 --> 09:01:21,500
No.

15033
09:01:22,840 --> 09:01:23,300
No.

15034
09:01:23,920 --> 09:01:25,340
Nothing in the ceilings either.

15035
09:01:26,520 --> 09:01:27,040
What the hell?

15036
09:01:27,620 --> 09:01:28,100
Stingy.

15037
09:01:28,960 --> 09:01:29,640
Oh, there's some gold.

15038
09:01:29,940 --> 09:01:30,260
Where?

15039
09:01:30,620 --> 09:01:31,040
Get it.

15040
09:01:31,240 --> 09:01:31,800
Below you.

15041
09:01:32,040 --> 09:01:32,720
Okay, I'll get it.

15042
09:01:33,960 --> 09:01:35,680
Looking above me right now.

15043
09:01:36,160 --> 09:01:37,660
Alright, we go straight, right?

15044
09:01:38,760 --> 09:01:39,940
Yeah, but hold on.

15045
09:01:40,140 --> 09:01:41,600
Alright, I'm digging forward.

15046
09:01:42,280 --> 09:01:42,780
Hold on!

15047
09:01:42,900 --> 09:01:45,180
I'll put torches next to the hole.

15048
09:01:45,860 --> 09:01:46,060
Okay.

15049
09:01:48,060 --> 09:01:49,140
Oh no, uh oh.

15050
09:01:49,560 --> 09:01:51,100
Don't be mad, I'm sorry.

15051
09:01:51,200 --> 09:01:52,240
Do you have gold on you?

15052
09:01:53,460 --> 09:01:54,600
Oh shit, he's mad at me.

15053
09:01:55,400 --> 09:01:57,780
Place blocks in front of it.

15054
09:01:57,960 --> 09:01:59,940
Get over here and place a block in front of it.

15055
09:02:01,000 --> 09:02:02,420
Okay, or place blocks in front of him.

15056
09:02:02,500 --> 09:02:03,220
I mean, that works too.

15057
09:02:04,560 --> 09:02:06,040
He's still trying to get me, but...

15058
09:02:06,040 --> 09:02:07,200
Get over here, get over here a minute.

15059
09:02:08,320 --> 09:02:09,260
Close the door!

15060
09:02:09,400 --> 09:02:10,600
Close the door!

15061
09:02:13,320 --> 09:02:14,500
Okay, straight, right?

15062
09:02:18,080 --> 09:02:19,520
I'm just gonna go straight for now.

15063
09:02:20,420 --> 09:02:21,540
For now is fine.

15064
09:02:22,240 --> 09:02:24,180
We're gonna have to...

15065
09:02:24,180 --> 09:02:25,340
What do we have to do?

15066
09:02:25,660 --> 09:02:26,860
Change direction.

15067
09:02:28,120 --> 09:02:30,080
Well, no, I think it's...

15068
09:02:30,080 --> 09:02:30,560
Wait, no.

15069
09:02:31,260 --> 09:02:32,740
I don't know, it's so hard.

15070
09:02:32,740 --> 09:02:34,540
I hate this, I hate navigating!

15071
09:02:36,520 --> 09:02:38,240
But we are going in the correct Z.

15072
09:02:39,000 --> 09:02:40,020
We just have to also...

15073
09:02:40,020 --> 09:02:41,720
But what about the X?

15074
09:02:42,580 --> 09:02:44,500
The X is like the biggest one.

15075
09:02:44,780 --> 09:02:47,680
Oh my god!

15076
09:02:49,140 --> 09:02:50,920
And to the sake of it, we go.

15077
09:02:51,620 --> 09:02:53,140
This is why we...

15078
09:02:53,880 --> 09:02:55,880
This is why we...

15079
09:02:55,880 --> 09:02:56,860
Should have just...

15080
09:02:57,780 --> 09:02:58,980
Got straighted.

15081
09:03:02,760 --> 09:03:05,360
We got... I think I did a hundred gold pieces.

15082
09:03:05,800 --> 09:03:09,420
I think I've done a hundred, man.

15083
09:03:09,640 --> 09:03:12,000
Yeah, but we only need a two more!

15084
09:03:12,820 --> 09:03:14,400
I've done a hundred, man.

15085
09:03:14,680 --> 09:03:15,400
We've only need a two more!

15086
09:03:15,400 --> 09:03:16,900
I've done a hundred!

15087
09:03:17,120 --> 09:03:18,100
We only need a two more!

15088
09:03:18,100 --> 09:03:19,920
I've done a hundred rolls!

15089
09:03:21,960 --> 09:03:23,720
We only need a two more!

15090
09:03:23,900 --> 09:03:25,300
What was this about?

15091
09:03:27,240 --> 09:03:28,260
Gamblers, give up!

15092
09:03:28,460 --> 09:03:29,460
Gamblers, give up!

15093
09:03:30,700 --> 09:03:33,560
We're doing it while we explore!

15094
09:03:35,940 --> 09:03:39,800
I almost just got killed for trying to...

15095
09:03:39,800 --> 09:03:42,460
Okay, so that's why when people are like...

15096
09:03:42,460 --> 09:03:44,840
Oh, just go one way and then go another way...

15097
09:03:44,840 --> 09:03:45,960
It doesn't really work in the nether.

15098
09:03:46,100 --> 09:03:47,600
Because the nether is really special.

15099
09:03:47,840 --> 09:03:50,480
And just makes you have to reroute everything.

15100
09:03:51,380 --> 09:03:52,240
I think we... Hold on.

15101
09:03:52,260 --> 09:03:54,340
Look at all those striders over there.

15102
09:03:54,600 --> 09:03:57,820
Look at all those striders just chilling in the fire.

15103
09:03:58,460 --> 09:04:00,320
We need to go this way.

15104
09:04:00,400 --> 09:04:01,180
Which way?

15105
09:04:01,800 --> 09:04:02,300
This way.

15106
09:04:03,540 --> 09:04:05,200
Okay, here we go.

15107
09:04:05,660 --> 09:04:07,800
Let's hope there's no ghastlies here.

15108
09:04:11,550 --> 09:04:13,600
I'm holding down my shift.

15109
09:04:13,720 --> 09:04:17,200
Let's hope my shift key doesn't accidentally broke at the end.

15110
09:04:17,700 --> 09:04:19,540
That would be very...

15111
09:04:19,540 --> 09:04:20,420
That would be crazy.

15112
09:04:20,740 --> 09:04:21,680
I'm drinking this.

15113
09:04:23,400 --> 09:04:24,940
You have another potion!

15114
09:04:24,940 --> 09:04:26,620
I'm drinking this.

15115
09:04:26,720 --> 09:04:28,300
I don't trust...

15116
09:04:29,280 --> 09:04:31,040
I can do this for three minutes.

15117
09:04:31,220 --> 09:04:32,800
I can do this.

15118
09:04:33,200 --> 09:04:35,060
I'll just chill...

15119
09:04:35,060 --> 09:04:36,280
Until we get to the other side.

15120
09:04:37,560 --> 09:04:40,160
You are the one that has the most...

15121
09:04:40,810 --> 09:04:43,940
I can do this for three minutes.

15122
09:04:44,280 --> 09:04:44,900
Are we...

15123
09:04:44,900 --> 09:04:46,420
Are we going the right way?

15124
09:04:47,360 --> 09:04:48,660
Just to be sure.

15125
09:04:49,020 --> 09:04:49,600
I need to know.

15126
09:04:50,280 --> 09:04:52,940
Positive X.

15127
09:04:52,940 --> 09:04:55,380
Mr. X, let me give it to you.

15128
09:04:55,520 --> 09:04:57,500
Is that a guy riding a strider down there?

15129
09:04:57,640 --> 09:04:59,180
We should kick him off.

15130
09:05:00,000 --> 09:05:01,300
Wait, you could do that.

15131
09:05:01,400 --> 09:05:01,940
You could drop him.

15132
09:05:01,940 --> 09:05:03,940
I'm not gonna drop down!

15133
09:05:04,980 --> 09:05:07,900
I'm not gonna drop down!

15134
09:05:08,980 --> 09:05:10,100
You have the potion!

15135
09:05:11,720 --> 09:05:15,840
We have other priorities right now!

15136
09:05:17,400 --> 09:05:18,560
You could do it!

15137
09:05:18,560 --> 09:05:18,700
You could do it!

15138
09:05:20,300 --> 09:05:22,540
You could steal that strider from him.

15139
09:05:22,540 --> 09:05:25,140
We have other priorities here.

15140
09:05:25,220 --> 09:05:26,780
We don't even have a saddle!

15141
09:05:27,040 --> 09:05:28,580
We don't even have a saddle.

15142
09:05:29,020 --> 09:05:30,320
We don't have a saddle.

15143
09:05:30,320 --> 09:05:33,480
That's why I'm saying you take the one from the guy riding it.

15144
09:05:33,500 --> 09:05:33,840
Where?

15145
09:05:34,700 --> 09:05:36,000
He doesn't have a saddle.

15146
09:05:36,220 --> 09:05:37,380
He doesn't even have a saddle.

15147
09:05:37,540 --> 09:05:38,580
He's just on top of it.

15148
09:05:38,800 --> 09:05:39,580
He's just chilling.

15149
09:05:39,960 --> 09:05:44,240
He doesn't even have a saddle.

15150
09:05:44,720 --> 09:05:45,840
No, I have more.

15151
09:05:45,840 --> 09:05:47,640
I have more.

15152
09:05:48,960 --> 09:05:50,900
My hand is cramping.

15153
09:05:52,160 --> 09:05:54,300
From pressing down the key.

15154
09:05:54,540 --> 09:05:55,240
We made it.

15155
09:05:55,440 --> 09:05:57,860
Oh my god, we actually made it.

15156
09:05:58,280 --> 09:05:59,300
We actually made it.

15157
09:05:59,300 --> 09:05:59,880
Watch out.

15158
09:06:01,460 --> 09:06:02,500
You have your mushrooms.

15159
09:06:02,640 --> 09:06:05,340
No, I have them.

15160
09:06:07,880 --> 09:06:08,600
Back!

15161
09:06:08,980 --> 09:06:09,920
Back, beast!

15162
09:06:10,900 --> 09:06:12,080
Which way do we go?

15163
09:06:12,700 --> 09:06:14,380
When I put one down...

15164
09:06:14,380 --> 09:06:15,840
When we get a little ways away...

15165
09:06:15,840 --> 09:06:17,860
Grab the old one, you know?

15166
09:06:18,320 --> 09:06:19,180
Back, beast!

15167
09:06:20,220 --> 09:06:21,540
Oh, now they're starting to attack him.

15168
09:06:21,620 --> 09:06:21,800
Nice.

15169
09:06:24,980 --> 09:06:25,820
Watch out here.

15170
09:06:26,600 --> 09:06:28,140
Oh my god, watch out right here.

15171
09:06:28,500 --> 09:06:29,400
Oh my god, wait.

15172
09:06:29,600 --> 09:06:30,400
This is not the way.

15173
09:06:30,900 --> 09:06:31,680
Don't follow me.

15174
09:06:32,320 --> 09:06:34,560
I'm scared they're gonna fucking hit us after that.

15175
09:06:34,940 --> 09:06:35,200
I know.

15176
09:06:39,080 --> 09:06:40,800
In fact, I'm just gonna kill this guy.

15177
09:06:43,700 --> 09:06:44,180
Nice.

15178
09:06:44,480 --> 09:06:46,560
Yeah, put that hog in the corner.

15179
09:06:47,020 --> 09:06:47,020
Easy.

15180
09:06:47,020 --> 09:06:48,100
And I'm gonna take his leather.

15181
09:06:48,360 --> 09:06:48,720
Nice.

15182
09:06:49,900 --> 09:06:51,200
Alright, which way is it?

15183
09:06:52,900 --> 09:06:53,380
Uh...

15184
09:06:53,380 --> 09:06:54,600
Why did you go ahead of me?

15185
09:06:54,720 --> 09:06:55,220
I don't know.

15186
09:06:55,320 --> 09:06:56,920
I just wanted to look in the open.

15187
09:06:57,380 --> 09:06:59,180
I just wanted...

15188
09:06:59,180 --> 09:07:00,500
I'm checking the coordinates.

15189
09:07:02,120 --> 09:07:03,940
Okay, we're just straight ahead.

15190
09:07:04,140 --> 09:07:05,540
Okay, just straight ahead.

15191
09:07:05,800 --> 09:07:07,260
Into the thick of it.

15192
09:07:08,760 --> 09:07:09,740
There's one here.

15193
09:07:14,620 --> 09:07:15,180
Yeah.

15194
09:07:15,520 --> 09:07:16,520
Back, beast.

15195
09:07:16,620 --> 09:07:16,940
Back.

15196
09:07:16,940 --> 09:07:17,660
Yeah, back.

15197
09:07:17,780 --> 09:07:18,620
Stay back.

15198
09:07:18,880 --> 09:07:19,820
Stay back, beast.

15199
09:07:20,380 --> 09:07:21,380
Stay back, beast.

15200
09:07:25,300 --> 09:07:26,580
Stay back, beast.

15201
09:07:27,040 --> 09:07:27,540
Be gone.

15202
09:07:28,440 --> 09:07:30,500
Be gone, you vile creatures.

15203
09:07:30,940 --> 09:07:31,440
Be gone.

15204
09:07:31,560 --> 09:07:32,660
Oh, there's another one.

15205
09:07:36,620 --> 09:07:38,100
Oh my gosh.

15206
09:07:38,220 --> 09:07:38,980
Where's the gold?

15207
09:07:39,060 --> 09:07:41,020
You wanna trade with these guys while we're here?

15208
09:07:41,180 --> 09:07:42,560
I don't have...

15209
09:07:42,560 --> 09:07:43,840
I have eight.

15210
09:07:44,320 --> 09:07:44,760
Oh.

15211
09:07:45,300 --> 09:07:46,800
Eight nuggies or eight pieces?

15212
09:07:47,100 --> 09:07:49,480
Eight nuggies.

15213
09:07:49,980 --> 09:07:50,700
Oh, okay.

15214
09:07:50,900 --> 09:07:53,860
We got five more gold, but there's no gold here.

15215
09:07:55,240 --> 09:07:56,280
We just head straight?

15216
09:07:57,340 --> 09:07:58,880
Yeah, just keep going straight.

15217
09:08:00,260 --> 09:08:00,660
Alright.

15218
09:08:03,980 --> 09:08:05,180
Wait, there's gold right there!

15219
09:08:05,260 --> 09:08:06,420
There's gold right there.

15220
09:08:06,640 --> 09:08:06,680
Okay.

15221
09:08:07,520 --> 09:08:07,900
Hold on.

15222
09:08:07,980 --> 09:08:09,300
Let's check the area first.

15223
09:08:11,040 --> 09:08:12,180
Is it safe?

15224
09:08:12,860 --> 09:08:14,080
I don't see any guys.

15225
09:08:14,280 --> 09:08:14,660
Alright.

15226
09:08:14,980 --> 09:08:16,040
I believe you.

15227
09:08:16,340 --> 09:08:17,720
I believe you.

15228
09:08:17,720 --> 09:08:20,500
I can't see over your area though, so...

15229
09:08:20,500 --> 09:08:21,480
I believe you.

15230
09:08:22,500 --> 09:08:23,120
Okay, nice.

15231
09:08:24,400 --> 09:08:25,340
Nice, nice.

15232
09:08:26,060 --> 09:08:26,260
Okay.

15233
09:08:31,420 --> 09:08:32,860
Why can't I build a thing here?

15234
09:08:34,080 --> 09:08:35,180
I'm trying to protect you.

15235
09:08:35,680 --> 09:08:36,800
A little house or something.

15236
09:08:38,380 --> 09:08:39,340
Okay, nice.

15237
09:08:41,520 --> 09:08:42,020
Alright.

15238
09:08:42,540 --> 09:08:43,220
Nice, that was a good amount.

15239
09:08:43,360 --> 09:08:44,560
That was...

15240
09:08:44,560 --> 09:08:45,140
34.

15241
09:08:46,800 --> 09:08:47,300
Okay.

15242
09:08:50,500 --> 09:08:51,300
Alright, guys.

15243
09:08:51,400 --> 09:08:53,100
Remember, we're trying to get to...

15244
09:08:53,100 --> 09:08:55,220
negative 505...

15245
09:08:55,220 --> 09:08:57,240
and 195.

15246
09:08:57,640 --> 09:08:58,700
We just keep going straight this way.

15247
09:08:58,940 --> 09:08:59,380
This way?

15248
09:08:59,560 --> 09:09:00,740
Where are we at?

15249
09:09:02,060 --> 09:09:02,560
Oh.

15250
09:09:03,060 --> 09:09:03,800
Don't look.

15251
09:09:05,260 --> 09:09:07,820
That's why I said maybe we should...

15252
09:09:07,820 --> 09:09:09,460
I looked.

15253
09:09:10,360 --> 09:09:10,840
I...

15254
09:09:11,840 --> 09:09:12,800
I looked.

15255
09:09:14,360 --> 09:09:14,840
Yeah.

15256
09:09:15,860 --> 09:09:16,340
Yeah.

15257
09:09:17,960 --> 09:09:19,640
We ran out of gold.

15258
09:09:19,880 --> 09:09:20,960
We ran out of gold.

15259
09:09:21,080 --> 09:09:22,280
There were no more gold to farm.

15260
09:09:22,440 --> 09:09:23,300
We farmed...

15261
09:09:23,300 --> 09:09:25,280
We, like, demolished the area.

15262
09:09:25,780 --> 09:09:28,280
We've taken all the natural resources around us.

15263
09:09:28,340 --> 09:09:29,180
Like, it's over.

15264
09:09:29,660 --> 09:09:30,160
Where are you?

15265
09:09:30,340 --> 09:09:30,900
Oh, there you are.

15266
09:09:31,600 --> 09:09:32,920
Do you want to get this guy?

15267
09:09:34,540 --> 09:09:35,700
Hit him up.

15268
09:09:35,700 --> 09:09:36,760
He might have some good stuff.

15269
09:09:36,760 --> 09:09:38,520
I'm making the gold now.

15270
09:09:38,920 --> 09:09:40,300
Yeah, he might have some good stuff.

15271
09:09:40,460 --> 09:09:40,900
Come on, guy.

15272
09:09:41,360 --> 09:09:42,800
We can just get out of here.

15273
09:09:43,000 --> 09:09:44,120
Like, we can just leave.

15274
09:09:44,360 --> 09:09:47,020
Alright, let's see if we can get the...

15275
09:09:47,020 --> 09:09:49,060
Oh my God, why did he drop that?

15276
09:09:49,120 --> 09:09:50,720
Why is he running away from me?

15277
09:09:59,560 --> 09:10:00,560
He gave me quartz.

15278
09:10:01,560 --> 09:10:02,760
He gave me quartz.

15279
09:10:03,720 --> 09:10:05,200
Okay, that's just one.

15280
09:10:05,900 --> 09:10:07,280
He gave me crying obsidian.

15281
09:10:07,400 --> 09:10:08,900
Hey, he gave me three crying obsidian.

15282
09:10:08,900 --> 09:10:10,620
He gave me three crying obsidian.

15283
09:10:12,660 --> 09:10:14,960
And then I got leather.

15284
09:10:16,500 --> 09:10:18,220
Okay, but you can give the leather to me.

15285
09:10:26,920 --> 09:10:28,620
That's all you got?

15286
09:10:28,660 --> 09:10:29,760
That's all I got.

15287
09:10:30,690 --> 09:10:32,900
Crying obsidian and quartz.

15288
09:10:34,980 --> 09:10:37,680
Okay, let's keep going this way then.

15289
09:10:40,640 --> 09:10:41,700
We're digging through.

15290
09:10:42,420 --> 09:10:43,560
We're gonna try for gold.

15291
09:10:44,080 --> 09:10:45,360
We're gonna try and get gold.

15292
09:10:45,480 --> 09:10:46,220
We're gonna get gold.

15293
09:10:46,460 --> 09:10:48,240
We're gonna get gold in these mines.

15294
09:10:48,380 --> 09:10:49,140
We're gonna get gold.

15295
09:10:49,440 --> 09:10:50,680
We're gonna strike it rich.

15296
09:10:51,020 --> 09:10:53,500
Doki bird, you and me, we're gonna strike it rich.

15297
09:10:53,980 --> 09:10:55,420
Wait, why are you guys backing?

15298
09:10:55,580 --> 09:10:56,600
We've never left.

15299
09:10:56,680 --> 09:10:58,540
We've never left the net there.

15300
09:10:58,760 --> 09:11:00,240
There's no why are we backing.

15301
09:11:00,400 --> 09:11:01,540
We just stay there.

15302
09:11:05,120 --> 09:11:06,640
Oh, there's some gold in here.

15303
09:11:07,940 --> 09:11:08,440
Oh.

15304
09:11:09,580 --> 09:11:10,980
Hold on, let's build a bridge over there.

15305
09:11:14,450 --> 09:11:14,950
Alright.

15306
09:11:16,370 --> 09:11:16,870
Oh,

15307
09:11:20,230 --> 09:11:20,670
my bad.

15308
09:11:21,290 --> 09:11:21,490
Whoops.

15309
09:11:21,630 --> 09:11:24,890
I don't want to hit you accidentally so you can get that off.

15310
09:11:24,890 --> 09:11:25,090
Oh my god.

15311
09:11:25,970 --> 09:11:27,890
Okay, stop placing blocks.

15312
09:11:28,070 --> 09:11:28,850
This is my job.

15313
09:11:29,490 --> 09:11:31,290
I'm the architect here, okay?

15314
09:11:32,010 --> 09:11:33,030
This is my work.

15315
09:11:34,430 --> 09:11:34,810
Okay.

15316
09:11:35,070 --> 09:11:35,730
God damn it.

15317
09:11:35,730 --> 09:11:36,010
I don't know.

15318
09:11:36,910 --> 09:11:37,910
You can get it.

15319
09:11:38,050 --> 09:11:38,710
I don't even care.

15320
09:11:39,130 --> 09:11:39,850
There's two.

15321
09:11:39,990 --> 09:11:41,850
There's another area right here.

15322
09:11:42,090 --> 09:11:43,070
Okay, okay.

15323
09:11:43,230 --> 09:11:45,470
I'm just trying to be efficient.

15324
09:11:49,500 --> 09:11:50,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

15325
09:11:51,260 --> 09:11:52,340
Yeah, yeah, I see.

15326
09:11:52,560 --> 09:11:53,140
I get it.

15327
09:11:53,140 --> 09:11:53,700
Yeah, you see?

15328
09:11:53,820 --> 09:11:55,300
There's one right here.

15329
09:11:55,620 --> 09:11:56,180
Uh-huh.

15330
09:11:56,860 --> 09:11:57,520
Look, see?

15331
09:11:57,800 --> 09:11:59,520
This is efficiency right here.

15332
09:11:59,920 --> 09:12:00,800
German efficiency.

15333
09:12:01,020 --> 09:12:02,720
I can't even grab it.

15334
09:12:03,360 --> 09:12:05,020
So you're gonna have to take the block.

15335
09:12:05,020 --> 09:12:05,200
See?

15336
09:12:05,640 --> 09:12:05,880
See?

15337
09:12:06,240 --> 09:12:07,160
German efficiency.

15338
09:12:07,660 --> 09:12:08,480
Right there, right there.

15339
09:12:08,600 --> 09:12:10,060
So which way do we go now?

15340
09:12:10,660 --> 09:12:11,560
We keep going straight.

15341
09:12:12,220 --> 09:12:12,660
Straight?

15342
09:12:13,200 --> 09:12:13,640
Alright.

15343
09:12:15,480 --> 09:12:16,040
Alright.

15344
09:12:16,880 --> 09:12:18,120
Let's keep going.

15345
09:12:19,120 --> 09:12:21,040
Oh, oh, another area.

15346
09:12:21,860 --> 09:12:23,760
There's so much quartz in here!

15347
09:12:24,300 --> 09:12:25,780
Why is there so much quartz?

15348
09:12:26,780 --> 09:12:28,060
The land of the quartz.

15349
09:12:28,420 --> 09:12:29,020
What can I say?

15350
09:12:29,480 --> 09:12:31,280
The land of the quartz.

15351
09:12:31,280 --> 09:12:32,420
Oh, look, there's gold.

15352
09:12:32,540 --> 09:12:33,440
It's so far up.

15353
09:12:33,620 --> 09:12:34,380
There it is.

15354
09:12:34,380 --> 09:12:35,140
Is that cool?

15355
09:12:35,420 --> 09:12:36,400
The tiny two pieces of gold.

15356
09:12:36,400 --> 09:12:37,880
The two pieces of gold.

15357
09:12:38,100 --> 09:12:38,400
Wow!

15358
09:12:41,440 --> 09:12:42,400
Further onward.

15359
09:12:42,940 --> 09:12:44,120
Off we go.

15360
09:12:47,660 --> 09:12:49,900
Further onward, onward, onward.

15361
09:12:50,000 --> 09:12:50,320
Everybody.

15362
09:12:51,500 --> 09:12:52,660
Onward we go.

15363
09:12:52,760 --> 09:12:55,340
I think this is the worst sea we decided to stay on.

15364
09:12:55,420 --> 09:12:55,540
Oh, gold!

15365
09:12:56,820 --> 09:12:58,800
Oh my God, there's so much gold here.

15366
09:12:58,800 --> 09:13:00,060
Oh my God, thank God.

15367
09:13:00,520 --> 09:13:01,420
Oh, thank God.

15368
09:13:04,060 --> 09:13:05,720
Do you want me to grab it?

15369
09:13:05,860 --> 09:13:06,700
No, I can grab it.

15370
09:13:06,880 --> 09:13:08,420
Just be careful.

15371
09:13:10,560 --> 09:13:12,260
Oh, there's more over here too.

15372
09:13:12,640 --> 09:13:13,720
Oh, there's more!

15373
09:13:13,880 --> 09:13:15,660
I'll dig a tunnel over here to the gold.

15374
09:13:16,440 --> 09:13:17,940
Okay, we just gotta find some piglins now.

15375
09:13:18,360 --> 09:13:19,000
Come on, piglins.

15376
09:13:21,320 --> 09:13:22,620
Show thyself, piglin.

15377
09:13:23,620 --> 09:13:24,280
Come on.

15378
09:13:24,500 --> 09:13:26,800
It would be so cool if you guys just show up.

15379
09:13:27,660 --> 09:13:29,000
He's so funny.

15380
09:13:29,160 --> 09:13:30,540
It would be so funny.

15381
09:13:30,560 --> 09:13:33,180
Do you guys want to do something really funny right now?

15382
09:13:33,600 --> 09:13:34,940
But like, don't show up right now.

15383
09:13:35,080 --> 09:13:36,540
Because that would be like, kind of rude.

15384
09:13:37,480 --> 09:13:39,440
But it would be so funny though.

15385
09:13:39,920 --> 09:13:40,840
Oh, oopsie.

15386
09:13:41,000 --> 09:13:41,160
Ouch.

15387
09:13:44,020 --> 09:13:45,140
Got more gold.

15388
09:13:45,900 --> 09:13:46,940
There's more gold over here.

15389
09:13:49,500 --> 09:13:50,600
Oh my God.

15390
09:13:50,960 --> 09:13:52,840
Oh my God, it's...

15391
09:13:52,840 --> 09:13:54,440
Where are these little piggies?

15392
09:13:54,440 --> 09:13:56,340
This little piggy went...

15393
09:13:56,340 --> 09:13:58,160
Went, went, went all the way home.

15394
09:13:58,160 --> 09:13:58,900
All the way home.

15395
09:13:59,820 --> 09:14:00,800
Okay, I got seven.

15396
09:14:02,620 --> 09:14:03,840
How many did you get?

15397
09:14:03,900 --> 09:14:04,700
Grab these, grab these.

15398
09:14:05,660 --> 09:14:07,940
Oh, you didn't have inventory space, right?

15399
09:14:08,420 --> 09:14:09,180
No, I don't.

15400
09:14:10,520 --> 09:14:12,920
Okay, I think that is...

15401
09:14:12,920 --> 09:14:14,240
We got ten.

15402
09:14:14,400 --> 09:14:15,060
We have ten.

15403
09:14:15,700 --> 09:14:16,840
We just need to find...

15404
09:14:16,840 --> 09:14:18,100
We just gotta find them.

15405
09:14:18,900 --> 09:14:20,120
What are we at?

15406
09:14:20,580 --> 09:14:21,000
86...

15407
09:14:21,000 --> 09:14:23,380
We have to get a little lower actually.

15408
09:14:23,640 --> 09:14:24,740
We'll get lower eventually.

15409
09:14:24,920 --> 09:14:25,280
We'll get there.

15410
09:14:25,300 --> 09:14:26,400
We'll get there eventually.

15411
09:14:26,520 --> 09:14:27,180
We have a boat.

15412
09:14:27,300 --> 09:14:28,940
We have a boat.

15413
09:14:29,380 --> 09:14:32,060
Oh, can I have my crafting table?

15414
09:14:33,940 --> 09:14:34,860
I have space.

15415
09:14:34,900 --> 09:14:36,100
I mean, just give two to me.

15416
09:14:36,360 --> 09:14:38,500
I have the space for it anyway.

15417
09:14:38,740 --> 09:14:39,160
Okay, okay.

15418
09:14:39,700 --> 09:14:41,380
Alright, I'm just gonna make a bridge over here.

15419
09:14:45,600 --> 09:14:47,500
Do you think we'll do this tonight?

15420
09:14:47,500 --> 09:14:48,880
Yes, Mint.

15421
09:14:49,420 --> 09:14:51,000
We're not clickbaiters, Mint.

15422
09:14:51,160 --> 09:14:53,520
We're not clickbaiters, Mint.

15423
09:14:53,520 --> 09:14:56,240
No, but I mean if we have to fall asleep and then wake back up.

15424
09:14:56,280 --> 09:14:58,520
Mint, we're not clickbaiters, Mint.

15425
09:14:59,100 --> 09:14:59,540
We're not.

15426
09:14:59,620 --> 09:15:01,440
The stream doesn't end, Mint.

15427
09:15:01,760 --> 09:15:04,400
This is why we had that one day, Mint.

15428
09:15:04,940 --> 09:15:05,280
This is why.

15429
09:15:05,280 --> 09:15:06,280
Yeah, but they got to go...

15430
09:15:06,280 --> 09:15:09,040
The people who took 20 days got to go to sleep.

15431
09:15:09,300 --> 09:15:10,300
Do we not get to sleep?

15432
09:15:11,660 --> 09:15:13,440
They played for like two days...

15433
09:15:13,440 --> 09:15:15,500
Two to three days straight without sleeping.

15434
09:15:15,500 --> 09:15:17,360
And then they're like...

15435
09:15:17,360 --> 09:15:18,120
We gotta sleep.

15436
09:15:18,340 --> 09:15:20,120
It took longer than they expected.

15437
09:15:20,920 --> 09:15:23,820
If this is gonna take us more than a day...

15438
09:15:23,820 --> 09:15:25,100
Then like...

15439
09:15:25,100 --> 09:15:27,020
Maybe we do sleep.

15440
09:15:27,300 --> 09:15:29,440
But for now, we're in too deep.

15441
09:15:29,540 --> 09:15:30,400
We're in too deep, Mint.

15442
09:15:30,440 --> 09:15:31,200
We're in too deep.

15443
09:15:34,500 --> 09:15:37,400
Why did I agree to let you...

15444
09:15:37,400 --> 09:15:38,560
Let me do this?

15445
09:15:38,820 --> 09:15:41,640
I'm literally leaving town in like two days.

15446
09:15:41,640 --> 09:15:42,940
Why did I let you do this?

15447
09:15:42,940 --> 09:15:43,860
I don't know.

15448
09:15:44,560 --> 09:15:45,620
You said...

15449
09:15:45,620 --> 09:15:47,140
We were like...

15450
09:15:47,140 --> 09:15:49,960
We'll have that one day be like a free day.

15451
09:15:50,640 --> 09:15:52,400
But you wanted to start at five!

15452
09:15:52,980 --> 09:15:54,320
We started at two.

15453
09:15:54,520 --> 09:15:56,420
We started at two.

15454
09:15:57,180 --> 09:15:58,220
Oh, it was five for you.

15455
09:15:58,660 --> 09:15:58,980
Yeah!

15456
09:15:59,820 --> 09:16:01,100
You could've started earlier.

15457
09:16:02,580 --> 09:16:04,200
You could've asked for an earlier time.

15458
09:16:04,560 --> 09:16:05,320
I did!

15459
09:16:05,520 --> 09:16:07,620
You wanted to initially start at nine!

15460
09:16:08,000 --> 09:16:09,260
And then I was like...

15461
09:16:09,260 --> 09:16:10,660
Oh yeah, okay, let's just do two.

15462
09:16:10,920 --> 09:16:12,360
You could've started earlier.

15463
09:16:12,480 --> 09:16:13,820
You could've asked for an earlier time.

15464
09:16:15,360 --> 09:16:16,460
I'm gonna kill you.

15465
09:16:18,860 --> 09:16:19,780
I'm gonna kill you.

15466
09:16:19,840 --> 09:16:21,960
I'm gonna kill you.

15467
09:16:21,960 --> 09:16:23,380
I'm gonna kill you.

15468
09:16:23,880 --> 09:16:24,680
I'm gonna kill you.

15469
09:16:25,240 --> 09:16:26,280
I'm gonna kill you.

15470
09:16:26,440 --> 09:16:29,940
You better go to those pigs.

15471
09:16:30,120 --> 09:16:31,940
And you better get that obsidian right now.

15472
09:16:32,260 --> 09:16:33,680
You think I didn't know?

15473
09:16:33,900 --> 09:16:34,960
I did 200 rolls.

15474
09:16:35,060 --> 09:16:36,500
I did 200 rolls, Mint.

15475
09:16:36,500 --> 09:16:38,560
I did 200 fucking rolls!

15476
09:16:38,580 --> 09:16:40,180
You better go to luck!

15477
09:16:47,770 --> 09:16:50,190
I'm gonna take a week off of streaming...

15478
09:16:50,190 --> 09:16:51,630
and everybody will blame you.

15479
09:16:52,030 --> 09:16:55,290
Next week we are gonna be gone.

15480
09:16:55,830 --> 09:16:56,590
Oh yeah, that's true.

15481
09:16:56,650 --> 09:16:57,950
I am actually gonna be gone.

15482
09:16:59,050 --> 09:17:01,030
It's practically a week.

15483
09:17:01,090 --> 09:17:02,270
And I blame you!

15484
09:17:02,430 --> 09:17:04,190
They'll have you to blame!

15485
09:17:09,190 --> 09:17:10,070
Watch out!

15486
09:17:11,430 --> 09:17:12,670
Put the rock!

15487
09:17:13,550 --> 09:17:15,630
I wasn't... I couldn't...

15488
09:17:16,370 --> 09:17:17,030
Oh shit.

15489
09:17:17,190 --> 09:17:19,470
I was trying to get there.

15490
09:17:19,710 --> 09:17:20,170
There we go.

15491
09:17:21,490 --> 09:17:22,010
Okay, hold on.

15492
09:17:22,790 --> 09:17:23,470
There we go.

15493
09:17:26,090 --> 09:17:26,930
Okay, hold on.

15494
09:17:27,150 --> 09:17:28,070
I'm blocking it up.

15495
09:17:28,750 --> 09:17:31,690
I'm watching you do it.

15496
09:17:31,710 --> 09:17:32,710
I did it, I did it.

15497
09:17:32,730 --> 09:17:33,630
I blocked it up.

15498
09:17:35,370 --> 09:17:36,890
We're safe, we're good.

15499
09:17:36,890 --> 09:17:38,070
Everything's fine.

15500
09:17:38,230 --> 09:17:40,330
Hold on, I'm gonna move my thing over though.

15501
09:17:41,570 --> 09:17:43,170
Alright, here's the torch.

15502
09:17:43,230 --> 09:17:43,850
Doki hates us.

15503
09:17:44,570 --> 09:17:45,750
What do you mean?

15504
09:17:45,930 --> 09:17:47,970
More like you hate the wisps!

15505
09:17:47,970 --> 09:17:49,110
You wanted to stop!

15506
09:17:49,750 --> 09:17:51,210
I was reading my chat!

15507
09:17:51,830 --> 09:17:54,890
Someone sent me a super chat and you expect me not to read it out loud?

15508
09:17:55,050 --> 09:17:55,750
That's so rude!

15509
09:17:56,350 --> 09:17:58,210
Thank you for the super chat!

15510
09:17:58,230 --> 09:17:59,670
The super chat said Doki hates us!

15511
09:17:59,670 --> 09:18:02,730
So now we're allowed to read the super chats out loud!

15512
09:18:02,730 --> 09:18:04,250
You've always been allowed!

15513
09:18:04,250 --> 09:18:05,450
You're not allowed what you think I just said!

15514
09:18:06,270 --> 09:18:07,690
Oh wait, let me check on her.

15515
09:18:10,490 --> 09:18:11,650
Hold on, okay.

15516
09:18:12,070 --> 09:18:13,610
We are going down...

15517
09:18:14,150 --> 09:18:16,030
Very too slowly in the Z.

15518
09:18:16,670 --> 09:18:18,250
But we are making it...

15519
09:18:18,950 --> 09:18:19,750
In the X.

15520
09:18:22,270 --> 09:18:24,490
Okay, and the X is where we're...

15521
09:18:24,490 --> 09:18:25,810
We're the furthest away.

15522
09:18:26,490 --> 09:18:27,410
Yeah, kinda.

15523
09:18:27,650 --> 09:18:30,190
Oh, I need you to put down the...

15524
09:18:30,190 --> 09:18:31,730
Oh yeah, I forgot.

15525
09:18:31,730 --> 09:18:33,110
That's why I'm...

15526
09:18:33,690 --> 09:18:34,850
Alright, you take that then.

15527
09:18:34,950 --> 09:18:35,790
You take that.

15528
09:18:35,970 --> 09:18:37,090
No, you're right.

15529
09:18:39,070 --> 09:18:42,510
I just wanted to...

15530
09:18:42,510 --> 09:18:45,530
I wanted to free your inventory space.

15531
09:18:46,030 --> 09:18:47,870
I have too much cool stuff.

15532
09:18:48,270 --> 09:18:48,930
You don't understand.

15533
09:18:50,130 --> 09:18:51,570
Oh, I don't understand.

15534
09:18:51,790 --> 09:18:51,970
Alright.

15535
09:18:53,230 --> 09:18:54,210
Alright, let me dig.

15536
09:18:57,070 --> 09:18:58,450
Alright, your turn.

15537
09:18:58,450 --> 09:18:59,450
Alright.

15538
09:19:00,110 --> 09:19:02,090
Yeah, I've been doing all the work.

15539
09:19:02,870 --> 09:19:04,330
Oh, go back!

15540
09:19:04,930 --> 09:19:06,130
Get out!

15541
09:19:06,730 --> 09:19:07,250
It's my turn.

15542
09:19:07,270 --> 09:19:08,090
No, no, no!

15543
09:19:09,550 --> 09:19:12,850
I've been doing all the work!

15544
09:19:12,890 --> 09:19:15,010
You're someone too afraid of the world!

15545
09:19:15,690 --> 09:19:17,550
Someone is just like...

15546
09:19:17,550 --> 09:19:19,550
What if I'm stupid tonight?

15547
09:19:19,810 --> 09:19:21,290
No, no, no!

15548
09:19:22,390 --> 09:19:23,510
I'm gonna be...

15549
09:19:24,340 --> 09:19:26,170
Oh, that's true.

15550
09:19:26,170 --> 09:19:28,330
My chat was like, she is called Maid Mint.

15551
09:19:28,590 --> 09:19:29,450
She is called...

15552
09:19:29,970 --> 09:19:32,510
Be a maid right now and fucking do your work.

15553
09:19:33,110 --> 09:19:33,290
Alright.

15554
09:19:33,430 --> 09:19:35,690
Thank you for the super chat!

15555
09:19:37,050 --> 09:19:37,570
Alright,

15556
09:19:46,570 --> 09:19:47,110
turn around.

15557
09:19:47,210 --> 09:19:48,390
Why are you digging it?

15558
09:19:50,030 --> 09:19:50,550
Because...

15559
09:19:50,550 --> 09:19:51,810
Alright, your turn.

15560
09:19:53,190 --> 09:19:54,710
Oh, typical maid.

15561
09:19:55,350 --> 09:19:58,430
Oh no, I was reading a super chat that someone sent me.

15562
09:19:58,590 --> 09:19:59,450
Oh yeah, what was it?

15563
09:19:59,490 --> 09:20:00,310
What was it, huh?

15564
09:20:00,470 --> 09:20:03,830
It was actually them asking something, but I don't wanna answer it now!

15565
09:20:03,930 --> 09:20:04,910
Oh, you don't worry.

15566
09:20:05,090 --> 09:20:05,850
I'm getting the boat.

15567
09:20:05,890 --> 09:20:07,150
I'm fucking getting the boat.

15568
09:20:07,410 --> 09:20:09,510
I'm getting the boat right now.

15569
09:20:09,970 --> 09:20:12,190
Yeah, you wanna jump?

15570
09:20:13,890 --> 09:20:15,450
No, we can just keep...

15571
09:20:15,450 --> 09:20:16,290
Let me make a bridge.

15572
09:20:16,650 --> 09:20:17,570
We keep going.

15573
09:20:18,370 --> 09:20:19,710
We keep going through the walls.

15574
09:20:19,790 --> 09:20:20,390
It's the safest.

15575
09:20:20,390 --> 09:20:23,070
What, you wanna experience more gassed activity?

15576
09:20:23,230 --> 09:20:24,330
I'm just thinking like...

15577
09:20:24,330 --> 09:20:26,230
Oh, why don't we bump into one of those pigs?

15578
09:20:27,850 --> 09:20:28,650
What about a pig?

15579
09:20:28,710 --> 09:20:29,290
It's fine.

15580
09:20:29,550 --> 09:20:31,630
Oh, you wanna see a pig.

15581
09:20:31,810 --> 09:20:34,430
No, I meant the piglings.

15582
09:20:35,230 --> 09:20:36,590
Oh, okay.

15583
09:20:36,670 --> 09:20:37,010
Hold on.

15584
09:20:37,110 --> 09:20:39,790
No, we don't need to see the piglings.

15585
09:20:39,870 --> 09:20:40,670
Let's keep going forward.

15586
09:20:41,910 --> 09:20:42,530
Oh, look!

15587
09:20:42,550 --> 09:20:43,530
There's a pigling right in front of us!

15588
09:20:43,810 --> 09:20:44,730
Build a bridge!

15589
09:20:44,830 --> 09:20:46,370
There's a pigling literally right in front of us.

15590
09:20:46,810 --> 09:20:47,410
On the other side.

15591
09:20:47,410 --> 09:20:48,450
The one that the hoglin?

15592
09:20:48,750 --> 09:20:50,570
The one that will try to murder us?

15593
09:20:50,790 --> 09:20:51,410
I don't know!

15594
09:20:51,590 --> 09:20:52,890
The fucking good ones!

15595
09:20:53,690 --> 09:20:55,330
I don't see a good one.

15596
09:20:55,730 --> 09:20:57,610
I'm getting the block right now.

15597
09:20:57,870 --> 09:20:58,830
Okay, you do it.

15598
09:20:59,050 --> 09:21:01,090
Do you guys see a good one?

15599
09:21:01,290 --> 09:21:02,550
Look to your left.

15600
09:21:03,450 --> 09:21:03,950
What's that?

15601
09:21:06,410 --> 09:21:08,990
Oh, now you see it.

15602
09:21:09,010 --> 09:21:09,790
I couldn't see him.

15603
09:21:09,810 --> 09:21:11,930
He was blocked by your big old head.

15604
09:21:12,150 --> 09:21:14,050
You were in front of me!

15605
09:21:17,410 --> 09:21:17,870
Oh, man.

15606
09:21:18,130 --> 09:21:18,670
That sucks.

15607
09:21:18,930 --> 09:21:19,530
Okay, it's okay.

15608
09:21:19,630 --> 09:21:20,090
He fell.

15609
09:21:20,470 --> 09:21:21,630
I saw you missed too.

15610
09:21:22,850 --> 09:21:24,070
Get your mushrooms ready.

15611
09:21:24,790 --> 09:21:27,270
I got my mushrooms.

15612
09:21:28,130 --> 09:21:29,550
You also have one right here.

15613
09:21:29,750 --> 09:21:30,110
I know.

15614
09:21:30,430 --> 09:21:31,370
He's over here.

15615
09:21:31,830 --> 09:21:32,690
Alright, ten.

15616
09:21:32,930 --> 09:21:33,790
We have ten.

15617
09:21:34,450 --> 09:21:34,930
Ten.

15618
09:21:35,210 --> 09:21:35,550
Alright.

15619
09:21:36,230 --> 09:21:38,130
I'll put a mushroom next to me just in case.

15620
09:21:38,250 --> 09:21:39,850
Yeah, I put one around too.

15621
09:21:40,030 --> 09:21:41,790
Alright, this is it.

15622
09:21:41,870 --> 09:21:42,390
The gacha.

15623
09:21:43,090 --> 09:21:43,770
This is it.

15624
09:21:43,770 --> 09:21:45,490
Stay away.

15625
09:21:45,590 --> 09:21:46,730
Stay away, ugly.

15626
09:21:47,710 --> 09:21:48,550
Oh my god, we got one!

15627
09:21:48,790 --> 09:21:50,090
Get over here!

15628
09:21:50,370 --> 09:21:51,070
We got one!

15629
09:21:51,170 --> 09:21:51,810
We got one!

15630
09:21:51,810 --> 09:21:54,650
We got one more!

15631
09:21:54,990 --> 09:21:55,910
One more.

15632
09:21:56,810 --> 09:21:58,370
Oh my god, please.

15633
09:21:58,450 --> 09:22:00,750
Just one more.

15634
09:22:01,110 --> 09:22:04,170
Just one more.

15635
09:22:05,190 --> 09:22:07,670
Please be kind to us!

15636
09:22:07,790 --> 09:22:08,750
We got it!

15637
09:22:11,540 --> 09:22:13,220
Oh my god!

15638
09:22:13,220 --> 09:22:14,580
Oh my god, we got two!

15639
09:22:14,920 --> 09:22:16,060
We got two!

15640
09:22:21,730 --> 09:22:23,470
Wait, wait, wait.

15641
09:22:23,510 --> 09:22:26,250
Before I make these, you still have your diamond pickaxe?

15642
09:22:26,310 --> 09:22:26,790
Yeah, yeah.

15643
09:22:26,950 --> 09:22:29,650
Oh my god.

15644
09:22:30,010 --> 09:22:31,610
Yeah, I do.

15645
09:22:32,270 --> 09:22:33,030
Wait, what is it?

15646
09:22:33,090 --> 09:22:33,410
Two?

15647
09:22:34,250 --> 09:22:35,010
And then three?

15648
09:22:37,590 --> 09:22:38,850
One, two, three.

15649
09:22:39,390 --> 09:22:40,450
One, two, three.

15650
09:22:40,590 --> 09:22:42,130
Six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

15651
09:22:42,610 --> 09:22:44,790
And then...

15652
09:22:44,790 --> 09:22:46,790
And then right here...

15653
09:22:50,500 --> 09:22:52,310
And then it's fire time!

15654
09:22:55,370 --> 09:22:59,010
Get your bed ready just in case, and a shield maybe.

15655
09:22:59,150 --> 09:22:59,610
I don't know.

15656
09:23:00,990 --> 09:23:01,750
Here we go!

15657
09:23:03,030 --> 09:23:04,110
Here we go!

15658
09:23:06,410 --> 09:23:08,230
Wait, how many enderpearls do you have?

15659
09:23:09,970 --> 09:23:10,990
What just happened?

15660
09:23:13,210 --> 09:23:15,250
What the fuck is subspace bubble?

15661
09:23:16,430 --> 09:23:19,810
Use the nether to travel seven kilometers in the overworld.

15662
09:23:22,730 --> 09:23:24,550
Yeah, that sounds about right.

15663
09:23:24,910 --> 09:23:25,970
That sounds...

15664
09:23:25,970 --> 09:23:28,090
By the way, I don't have my bed anymore.

15665
09:23:28,730 --> 09:23:28,990
What?

15666
09:23:29,070 --> 09:23:29,930
What happened to your bed?

15667
09:23:30,530 --> 09:23:32,550
It's at our old spawn.

15668
09:23:35,910 --> 09:23:37,650
Should we head to our old spawn?

15669
09:23:37,650 --> 09:23:39,350
Should we head to our old nether?

15670
09:23:40,090 --> 09:23:41,210
Yeah, let me get the coordinates.

15671
09:23:42,790 --> 09:23:43,570
Let's go.

15672
09:23:43,790 --> 09:23:44,890
Fine, let me get the coordinates.

15673
09:23:46,990 --> 09:23:49,010
Now we got it.

15674
09:23:50,390 --> 09:23:52,150
So literally me being like...

15675
09:23:52,150 --> 09:23:54,890
Prepare your bed, and you just didn't say anything.

15676
09:23:58,430 --> 09:24:00,070
Okay, do you want to know the damage?

15677
09:24:00,390 --> 09:24:01,170
Oh my god.

15678
09:24:02,310 --> 09:24:03,450
What's the damage?

15679
09:24:03,630 --> 09:24:05,130
What's the damage?

15680
09:24:05,130 --> 09:24:05,550
What's the damage?

15681
09:24:06,850 --> 09:24:08,430
So, look at...

15682
09:24:08,430 --> 09:24:09,530
Look at where we're at.

15683
09:24:10,190 --> 09:24:11,030
Okay.

15684
09:24:11,990 --> 09:24:13,850
We need to get to...

15685
09:24:13,850 --> 09:24:16,390
Minus 4,116.

15686
09:24:17,530 --> 09:24:17,930
Oh.

15687
09:24:18,530 --> 09:24:19,190
What's the Z?

15688
09:24:19,670 --> 09:24:21,110
What's the Z?

15689
09:24:22,970 --> 09:24:23,990
What's the Z?

15690
09:24:24,850 --> 09:24:26,030
1,000...

15691
09:24:26,030 --> 09:24:28,230
1,570.

15692
09:24:29,350 --> 09:24:31,250
Let's go traveling.

15693
09:24:35,130 --> 09:24:36,170
Let's find a sheep, right?

15694
09:24:37,490 --> 09:24:39,250
Well, we might as well...

15695
09:24:39,250 --> 09:24:40,730
I don't think there's... Wait, which way?

15696
09:24:40,790 --> 09:24:41,650
Which way do we go?

15697
09:24:43,290 --> 09:24:44,370
Let's um...

15698
09:24:45,150 --> 09:24:46,350
It's a road trip.

15699
09:24:46,470 --> 09:24:49,340
We gotta go to positive Z.

15700
09:24:50,390 --> 09:24:51,750
It's a road trip.

15701
09:24:52,910 --> 09:24:53,250
Negative Z.

15702
09:24:53,250 --> 09:24:53,710
Negative Z.

15703
09:24:54,190 --> 09:24:55,410
We're not going the right way.

15704
09:24:59,540 --> 09:25:00,380
This way.

15705
09:25:01,520 --> 09:25:01,820
Alright.

15706
09:25:01,980 --> 09:25:05,080
Let's find the village first, so we make it home.

15707
09:25:06,600 --> 09:25:07,980
We'll find a village, probably.

15708
09:25:08,380 --> 09:25:08,780
Somewhere.

15709
09:25:09,500 --> 09:25:10,940
It's one or the other.

15710
09:25:11,420 --> 09:25:12,720
It's one or the other.

15711
09:25:14,960 --> 09:25:16,600
The lapis and the enderpearl.

15712
09:25:18,160 --> 09:25:20,200
How many ender... I have 10 enderpearls right now.

15713
09:25:20,200 --> 09:25:21,040
We had 10 at 5.

15714
09:25:21,100 --> 09:25:21,620
We have 15.

15715
09:25:21,840 --> 09:25:22,300
Is that enough?

15716
09:25:22,960 --> 09:25:23,880
Is that enough, you guys?

15717
09:25:23,940 --> 09:25:24,580
I don't remember.

15718
09:25:25,120 --> 09:25:28,880
I mean, guys, we gotta go this way anyway.

15719
09:25:29,100 --> 09:25:30,340
So, like, we gotta travel.

15720
09:25:30,540 --> 09:25:32,780
This might be a good time to get the phantom, right?

15721
09:25:32,960 --> 09:25:33,360
Because...

15722
09:25:33,360 --> 09:25:34,060
Yeah, exactly.

15723
09:25:34,260 --> 09:25:36,480
We could just walk around until the phantom appears.

15724
09:25:37,400 --> 09:25:40,540
Well, I mean, we have to not sleep for, like, three days.

15725
09:25:40,720 --> 09:25:41,380
Yeah, that's fine.

15726
09:25:41,920 --> 09:25:42,280
Okay.

15727
09:25:42,480 --> 09:25:43,120
Let's keep walking.

15728
09:25:43,500 --> 09:25:46,120
I love how we're, like, absolutely littering in this world.

15729
09:25:46,400 --> 09:25:46,540
It's fine.

15730
09:25:47,220 --> 09:25:50,440
We're never coming back to see the damages we caused environmentally.

15731
09:25:51,360 --> 09:25:51,820
It's true.

15732
09:25:52,200 --> 09:25:55,020
We're gonna defeat the ender dragon and delete Minecraft.

15733
09:25:57,080 --> 09:25:58,020
That is enough.

15734
09:25:58,140 --> 09:25:58,860
What the fuck?

15735
09:25:59,480 --> 09:25:59,940
Wait, hold on.

15736
09:25:59,940 --> 09:26:02,100
The sugarcane just killed itself.

15737
09:26:02,280 --> 09:26:04,220
We're not... You're not going the right way.

15738
09:26:04,400 --> 09:26:05,060
I'm not?

15739
09:26:05,180 --> 09:26:05,820
I barely...

15740
09:26:05,820 --> 09:26:06,240
Okay.

15741
09:26:08,020 --> 09:26:08,780
Oh, gosh.

15742
09:26:08,840 --> 09:26:09,200
Hold on.

15743
09:26:09,640 --> 09:26:12,060
It's really confusing, because one is really...

15744
09:26:12,520 --> 09:26:15,200
Okay, I think we just need to go down the X.

15745
09:26:15,420 --> 09:26:16,200
Okay, this way?

15746
09:26:16,300 --> 09:26:16,540
Okay.

15747
09:26:17,180 --> 09:26:17,500
Yeah.

15748
09:26:17,700 --> 09:26:18,540
Oh, I need to eat.

15749
09:26:20,160 --> 09:26:21,280
Let me know if you need food.

15750
09:26:23,440 --> 09:26:23,840
North...

15751
09:26:24,240 --> 09:26:25,680
Northeast is where we need to go.

15752
09:26:26,220 --> 09:26:27,440
Am I going the right way?

15753
09:26:27,440 --> 09:26:29,020
Well, I don't know.

15754
09:26:29,740 --> 09:26:30,820
Whoa, what is this?

15755
09:26:30,880 --> 09:26:31,740
It looks crazy.

15756
09:26:32,700 --> 09:26:33,980
Am I going the right way?

15757
09:26:34,180 --> 09:26:35,380
Just go around it.

15758
09:26:35,480 --> 09:26:36,280
Just go around it.

15759
09:26:36,500 --> 09:26:39,540
What if we make a boat?

15760
09:26:39,700 --> 09:26:39,920
Make a boat.

15761
09:26:41,060 --> 09:26:41,780
Get in.

15762
09:26:43,220 --> 09:26:44,940
Well, I would've.

15763
09:26:45,780 --> 09:26:46,500
I'm drifting.

15764
09:26:46,680 --> 09:26:47,160
I'm drifting.

15765
09:26:47,800 --> 09:26:49,100
Okay, go, go, go.

15766
09:26:49,420 --> 09:26:50,960
Okay, give me a sec.

15767
09:26:51,100 --> 09:26:51,540
I need a...

15768
09:26:51,540 --> 09:26:52,160
Okay, there we go.

15769
09:26:52,840 --> 09:26:53,280
There we go.

15770
09:26:53,340 --> 09:26:53,920
I'm rowing.

15771
09:26:53,920 --> 09:26:54,940
Give me a second.

15772
09:26:55,320 --> 09:26:56,720
I need to get my...

15773
09:26:56,720 --> 09:26:58,360
Oh, village, village, village, village.

15774
09:26:58,460 --> 09:26:58,620
Where?

15775
09:26:59,440 --> 09:27:00,340
Oh, okay, nice.

15776
09:27:04,060 --> 09:27:06,140
Okay, what does F4 do, guys?

15777
09:27:06,220 --> 09:27:07,260
I accidentally pressed F4.

15778
09:27:08,340 --> 09:27:10,800
I don't know.

15779
09:27:10,880 --> 09:27:12,580
I feel like every function does stuff.

15780
09:27:13,700 --> 09:27:15,920
It's like half normal and half, like...

15781
09:27:16,500 --> 09:27:18,320
I think we should just stay...

15782
09:27:18,320 --> 09:27:19,740
awake in here, right?

15783
09:27:19,860 --> 09:27:22,340
Like, we can just camp out here, but...

15784
09:27:22,340 --> 09:27:23,280
Camp the night?

15785
09:27:23,820 --> 09:27:24,720
Camp out the night?

15786
09:27:26,280 --> 09:27:28,080
Don't you think the longest night cycle?

15787
09:27:29,000 --> 09:27:30,040
I know, but like...

15788
09:27:30,040 --> 09:27:32,200
We gotta stay up for several nights.

15789
09:27:32,420 --> 09:27:35,380
Well, we're gonna make the villagers turn into zombies.

15790
09:27:36,180 --> 09:27:37,200
No, they're asleep.

15791
09:27:38,040 --> 09:27:41,280
What if a zombie breaks open one of the doors?

15792
09:27:42,320 --> 09:27:44,200
Some of the villagers aren't even inside.

15793
09:27:45,680 --> 09:27:48,660
We're gonna cause a zombie apocalypse to these poor villagers.

15794
09:27:49,500 --> 09:27:50,900
Okay, then put down torches.

15795
09:27:50,900 --> 09:27:51,320
I don't know.

15796
09:27:51,420 --> 09:27:52,060
What do you want me to do?

15797
09:27:52,300 --> 09:27:53,680
We gotta stay awake.

15798
09:27:54,900 --> 09:27:56,080
That's so cruel.

15799
09:27:56,220 --> 09:27:57,340
I'm sorry, guys.

15800
09:27:58,300 --> 09:28:00,080
She doesn't care about you.

15801
09:28:00,300 --> 09:28:01,700
They're literally inside.

15802
09:28:01,960 --> 09:28:03,780
They can break doors.

15803
09:28:03,880 --> 09:28:04,740
That's what zombies do.

15804
09:28:04,860 --> 09:28:05,800
They break doors.

15805
09:28:06,100 --> 09:28:07,920
Zombies do not break doors.

15806
09:28:08,200 --> 09:28:10,380
What Minecraft are you playing?

15807
09:28:10,540 --> 09:28:11,260
Yes, they do.

15808
09:28:11,340 --> 09:28:12,840
I saw them break doors.

15809
09:28:14,540 --> 09:28:15,020
What?

15810
09:28:15,020 --> 09:28:16,760
Also, why do we care about them?

15811
09:28:16,960 --> 09:28:19,120
Oh, they do in hard mode.

15812
09:28:20,420 --> 09:28:21,620
They do.

15813
09:28:22,600 --> 09:28:24,440
Only in hard mode.

15814
09:28:25,620 --> 09:28:27,080
Aren't we in hardcore?

15815
09:28:27,920 --> 09:28:29,360
Yeah, but I didn't know that.

15816
09:28:29,440 --> 09:28:33,860
I've only played normal mode and I don't watch Minecraft YouTubers like you do.

15817
09:28:35,160 --> 09:28:36,800
I've seen them break doors.

15818
09:28:36,920 --> 09:28:38,480
I've seen them break doors.

15819
09:28:40,120 --> 09:28:41,660
Wow, I didn't know that.

15820
09:28:42,880 --> 09:28:43,640
I had no idea.

15821
09:28:43,640 --> 09:28:44,640
I learned something today.

15822
09:28:47,100 --> 09:28:49,560
Someone said make fences in front of the doors.

15823
09:28:50,080 --> 09:28:52,140
Oh my god, I don't care enough about the villagers for that.

15824
09:28:52,380 --> 09:28:53,480
I'm just a virtue signal.

15825
09:28:53,760 --> 09:28:54,140
I care about us.

15826
09:28:54,200 --> 09:28:55,900
Yeah, I'm just here to virtue signal.

15827
09:28:58,520 --> 09:29:01,360
I'll just put some nether rack.

15828
09:29:01,460 --> 09:29:02,020
That's fine.

15829
09:29:02,160 --> 09:29:03,160
I have plenty of it.

15830
09:29:05,740 --> 09:29:07,200
There, I make my own door.

15831
09:29:07,560 --> 09:29:08,480
There, they can't get in.

15832
09:29:08,800 --> 09:29:09,440
Stupid zombies.

15833
09:29:10,620 --> 09:29:12,020
Oh my god.

15834
09:29:12,260 --> 09:29:13,920
There's no zombies near me yet.

15835
09:29:14,760 --> 09:29:16,440
I put down some torches, so...

15836
09:29:17,080 --> 09:29:17,620
I should be okay.

15837
09:29:18,340 --> 09:29:18,820
There we go.

15838
09:29:19,140 --> 09:29:20,420
You're safe with me, sir.

15839
09:29:20,660 --> 09:29:22,140
Wait, there's a horse in front of me.

15840
09:29:23,700 --> 09:29:25,060
Yeah, there's a couple of horses here.

15841
09:29:25,300 --> 09:29:27,040
Yeah, if only we had a saddle.

15842
09:29:27,180 --> 09:29:29,240
We could steal the horse and just ride on.

15843
09:29:30,360 --> 09:29:31,420
No, horses suck.

15844
09:29:31,720 --> 09:29:33,380
No, not all horses suck.

15845
09:29:33,440 --> 09:29:34,300
Not all horses.

15846
09:29:35,240 --> 09:29:38,040
I'm gonna go take this time to get water.

15847
09:29:38,040 --> 09:29:38,760
Okay.

15848
09:29:39,880 --> 09:29:43,200
Wait, we gotta kill chickens for feathers later.

15849
09:29:45,320 --> 09:29:48,080
Yeah, we gotta...

15850
09:29:48,080 --> 09:29:49,000
Are you leaving the house?

15851
09:29:49,260 --> 09:29:49,760
Oh my god.

15852
09:29:49,820 --> 09:29:50,580
No, I'm not.

15853
09:29:50,780 --> 09:29:53,940
Someone said we can trade for feathers, but that's too much work.

15854
09:29:57,980 --> 09:29:59,520
That's too much work.

15855
09:29:59,660 --> 09:30:01,180
We'll kill them on our way to...

15856
09:30:01,180 --> 09:30:02,620
We'll find chickens.

15857
09:30:02,940 --> 09:30:05,980
There's gonna be so many chickens.

15858
09:30:06,820 --> 09:30:08,280
Wait, oh wait.

15859
09:30:09,420 --> 09:30:11,040
We've been awake for several nights.

15860
09:30:11,160 --> 09:30:14,040
So actually, maybe the phantoms will just normally spawn.

15861
09:30:14,260 --> 09:30:15,460
But we were trapped in the nether.

15862
09:30:15,640 --> 09:30:16,340
Does that count?

15863
09:30:16,700 --> 09:30:17,800
Does that count, you guys?

15864
09:30:17,940 --> 09:30:18,680
It should, right?

15865
09:30:22,100 --> 09:30:23,880
Does it count when we're...

15866
09:30:23,880 --> 09:30:25,040
Oh, it does count!

15867
09:30:25,420 --> 09:30:26,140
Oh, okay.

15868
09:30:26,200 --> 09:30:26,660
What are we doing?

15869
09:30:26,800 --> 09:30:27,800
Oh my god, so we need to go outside.

15870
09:30:28,920 --> 09:30:31,240
Okay, you go...

15871
09:30:32,020 --> 09:30:33,760
You go fucking...

15872
09:30:33,760 --> 09:30:35,340
You go outside and test it.

15873
09:30:35,700 --> 09:30:38,720
One of us, just one of us needs to...

15874
09:30:38,720 --> 09:30:39,500
No, there's none.

15875
09:30:40,800 --> 09:30:41,360
Oh, there's a chicken.

15876
09:30:43,120 --> 09:30:43,800
Oh my god, there's a zombie.

15877
09:30:44,500 --> 09:30:44,920
Jumbo.

15878
09:30:45,720 --> 09:30:46,200
God chicken.

15879
09:30:48,240 --> 09:30:49,660
You bust down doors.

15880
09:30:49,960 --> 09:30:50,820
I got a chicken.

15881
09:30:52,180 --> 09:30:53,540
And you also hit harder.

15882
09:30:53,840 --> 09:30:54,560
I don't like that.

15883
09:30:55,680 --> 09:30:56,660
I got a chicken.

15884
09:30:58,160 --> 09:31:00,420
Oh my god, I don't want to see another enderman ever again.

15885
09:31:00,740 --> 09:31:01,620
I got a chicken.

15886
09:31:01,620 --> 09:31:02,080
What the hell?

15887
09:31:02,640 --> 09:31:03,840
What is going on over there?

15888
09:31:03,920 --> 09:31:04,880
Oh, the iron golem.

15889
09:31:05,280 --> 09:31:06,440
I got a chicken.

15890
09:31:07,060 --> 09:31:08,640
Wait, there's no phantoms, you guys.

15891
09:31:08,820 --> 09:31:09,740
Let's just walk.

15892
09:31:10,020 --> 09:31:11,720
What are you afraid of?

15893
09:31:11,720 --> 09:31:12,640
Let's just keep walking.

15894
09:31:13,100 --> 09:31:13,880
We'll keep walking.

15895
09:31:13,960 --> 09:31:14,740
What are you afraid of?

15896
09:31:14,760 --> 09:31:15,600
We're losing time.

15897
09:31:16,740 --> 09:31:17,720
Get over here.

15898
09:31:17,760 --> 09:31:18,660
We have diamond armor.

15899
09:31:18,760 --> 09:31:19,620
We can't die.

15900
09:31:21,600 --> 09:31:23,020
We're decked out in diamond.

15901
09:31:23,140 --> 09:31:24,000
What are you scared of?

15902
09:31:26,740 --> 09:31:27,740
That's right, come on.

15903
09:31:27,740 --> 09:31:27,980
What?

15904
09:31:28,840 --> 09:31:30,860
You're not even going the right way.

15905
09:31:31,260 --> 09:31:31,700
Okay.

15906
09:31:33,740 --> 09:31:34,820
Oh my god.

15907
09:31:34,900 --> 09:31:35,960
I'm grabbing your bed.

15908
09:31:36,760 --> 09:31:38,680
You're gonna turn into a zombie and I don't care.

15909
09:31:39,500 --> 09:31:41,060
What are you talking about?

15910
09:31:41,320 --> 09:31:42,040
Where are you going?

15911
09:31:42,340 --> 09:31:43,780
I'm stealing this guy's bed.

15912
09:31:45,000 --> 09:31:46,240
Wait, are you going to sleep?

15913
09:31:46,420 --> 09:31:48,860
No, it's for the future when we can sleep.

15914
09:31:49,460 --> 09:31:51,060
Okay, for the future when we can sleep.

15915
09:31:51,200 --> 09:31:52,540
Where are the phantoms?

15916
09:31:53,460 --> 09:31:54,180
It doesn't work.

15917
09:31:54,300 --> 09:31:55,780
We gotta stay up even longer.

15918
09:31:55,780 --> 09:31:57,420
It doesn't work, you guys.

15919
09:32:00,980 --> 09:32:01,800
Alright, let's go.

15920
09:32:02,120 --> 09:32:03,180
These zombies don't hurt.

15921
09:32:03,400 --> 09:32:04,380
We have diamond armor.

15922
09:32:06,160 --> 09:32:06,940
Alright, let's go.

15923
09:32:06,980 --> 09:32:07,300
Which way?

15924
09:32:09,300 --> 09:32:11,020
The way we were going in the boat.

15925
09:32:16,850 --> 09:32:17,750
I got the feather.

15926
09:32:18,810 --> 09:32:19,810
I think, yeah, I got feather.

15927
09:32:20,810 --> 09:32:21,690
Oh, there's lots of chickens here.

15928
09:32:22,530 --> 09:32:23,730
There's so many chickens.

15929
09:32:24,390 --> 09:32:25,390
Get over here, chickens.

15930
09:32:25,390 --> 09:32:27,630
I don't even need you for your meat.

15931
09:32:27,710 --> 09:32:30,150
I don't even need you for your meat here.

15932
09:32:30,330 --> 09:32:30,610
Kill!

15933
09:32:30,930 --> 09:32:31,190
Kill them!

15934
09:32:31,190 --> 09:32:31,950
Actually, maybe I should.

15935
09:32:32,070 --> 09:32:33,850
We need magma cream, right?

15936
09:32:35,810 --> 09:32:37,630
I have three magma cream.

15937
09:32:37,810 --> 09:32:41,470
Okay, by the way, there's more magma cream on the area left.

15938
09:32:41,790 --> 09:32:42,450
Wait, where are we going?

15939
09:32:43,970 --> 09:32:44,830
Where did you go?

15940
09:32:45,770 --> 09:32:46,590
Oh, I see.

15941
09:32:46,670 --> 09:32:47,470
Is that the right way?

15942
09:32:48,730 --> 09:32:50,410
Yeah, I'm scared of the skellies.

15943
09:32:50,830 --> 09:32:52,450
Oh my god, we're diamond armor.

15944
09:32:52,630 --> 09:32:53,670
Don't nothing to be afraid of.

15945
09:32:53,670 --> 09:32:54,110
Just go.

15946
09:32:55,450 --> 09:32:57,430
There it is!

15947
09:33:01,190 --> 09:33:02,150
Okay, um...

15948
09:33:02,150 --> 09:33:03,470
Are you alive?

15949
09:33:03,710 --> 09:33:05,030
Yeah, I'm trying to get the phantom.

15950
09:33:05,550 --> 09:33:06,130
I'm just running.

15951
09:33:06,770 --> 09:33:09,410
I'm getting the phantom.

15952
09:33:10,290 --> 09:33:11,410
You're dealing with the phantom?

15953
09:33:11,490 --> 09:33:12,370
Yeah, I'm dealing with the phantom.

15954
09:33:14,150 --> 09:33:15,310
I don't have one.

15955
09:33:16,550 --> 09:33:16,930
Do I?

15956
09:33:17,990 --> 09:33:19,450
Oh, I see you fighting Norsh.

15957
09:33:19,450 --> 09:33:20,730
Oh my god, my demons.

15958
09:33:20,730 --> 09:33:22,510
Oh, my nightmares are here.

15959
09:33:27,270 --> 09:33:28,350
I got one of them.

15960
09:33:29,410 --> 09:33:30,290
Get over here.

15961
09:33:31,110 --> 09:33:32,950
What do I need from the phantoms?

15962
09:33:33,450 --> 09:33:34,310
They're membranes.

15963
09:33:34,430 --> 09:33:35,410
They're membranes.

15964
09:33:37,110 --> 09:33:38,370
Collect their membranes.

15965
09:33:38,530 --> 09:33:39,790
Oh my god, there it is.

15966
09:33:40,530 --> 09:33:42,070
I don't need this anymore.

15967
09:33:42,170 --> 09:33:42,790
I got one.

15968
09:33:43,370 --> 09:33:44,230
Alright, let's go.

15969
09:33:44,310 --> 09:33:44,830
Let's keep going.

15970
09:33:44,950 --> 09:33:45,690
Wait, where did you go?

15971
09:33:46,290 --> 09:33:49,470
I went further because I was dealing with the skellies.

15972
09:33:49,470 --> 09:33:50,810
Oh my god.

15973
09:33:50,810 --> 09:33:51,530
I'm killing chickens.

15974
09:33:51,850 --> 09:33:54,530
Alright, I'm gonna see if I can find you.

15975
09:33:56,090 --> 09:33:57,450
I don't trust you.

15976
09:33:57,450 --> 09:33:58,310
Did you just go straight?

15977
09:33:59,070 --> 09:34:00,430
Yeah, I just went straight.

15978
09:34:00,810 --> 09:34:01,390
Alright, okay.

15979
09:34:03,470 --> 09:34:05,350
I gotta get my cough drops.

15980
09:34:05,970 --> 09:34:06,430
Oh god.

15981
09:34:07,070 --> 09:34:07,350
Alright.

15982
09:34:10,710 --> 09:34:13,570
Okay, look behind me and see if there's anybody behind me.

15983
09:34:14,150 --> 09:34:14,950
No, you're good.

15984
09:34:14,970 --> 09:34:15,630
Alright, let's go.

15985
09:34:15,630 --> 09:34:17,630
We keep traveling.

15986
09:34:17,950 --> 09:34:19,150
We keep traveling.

15987
09:34:19,470 --> 09:34:20,130
We keep traveling.

15988
09:34:20,510 --> 09:34:21,930
I do have a boat.

15989
09:34:22,190 --> 09:34:24,070
If I do the boat, we go that way.

15990
09:34:24,350 --> 09:34:24,930
Is it correct?

15991
09:34:25,990 --> 09:34:27,050
It should be, yeah.

15992
09:34:27,830 --> 09:34:28,770
Let's go on the boat.

15993
09:34:28,850 --> 09:34:29,930
It's boat time.

15994
09:34:30,350 --> 09:34:31,250
Boating time.

15995
09:34:33,270 --> 09:34:33,630
Alright.

15996
09:34:35,330 --> 09:34:36,370
I'm rowing.

15997
09:34:36,570 --> 09:34:37,790
I'm rowing.

15998
09:34:38,250 --> 09:34:41,770
Let me know if I'm going the right way.

15999
09:34:41,770 --> 09:34:41,830
Are you here?

16000
09:34:43,790 --> 09:34:45,310
No, you're not.

16001
09:34:46,070 --> 09:34:47,010
Okay, hold on.

16002
09:34:47,870 --> 09:34:48,510
Alright, what are the numbers?

16003
09:34:49,510 --> 09:34:50,750
Let me drive.

16004
09:34:51,590 --> 09:34:52,810
Let me drive.

16005
09:34:59,170 --> 09:35:00,250
I'm okay now.

16006
09:35:01,110 --> 09:35:03,750
Hold on, I'm figuring it out.

16007
09:35:04,250 --> 09:35:05,030
It's almost day.

16008
09:35:06,050 --> 09:35:06,450
Okay.

16009
09:35:08,530 --> 09:35:10,890
But also not for the...

16010
09:35:10,890 --> 09:35:12,910
How do I get the Z to go down?

16011
09:35:15,230 --> 09:35:17,250
The Z is the scariest part.

16012
09:35:17,450 --> 09:35:17,750
I know.

16013
09:35:19,570 --> 09:35:22,110
Oh my god, I can only get the X to go down.

16014
09:35:22,450 --> 09:35:23,330
Okay, let me drive.

16015
09:35:23,770 --> 09:35:24,410
No, no, no.

16016
09:35:24,610 --> 09:35:25,070
I got it.

16017
09:35:25,750 --> 09:35:26,670
I got it.

16018
09:35:27,050 --> 09:35:29,790
I had to go around this island.

16019
09:35:30,170 --> 09:35:30,730
Okay, we're good.

16020
09:35:30,730 --> 09:35:32,230
We're good, North-East.

16021
09:35:32,470 --> 09:35:34,310
We're going North-East.

16022
09:35:34,490 --> 09:35:37,390
If we're not going North-East, we're going the wrong direction, okay?

16023
09:35:37,490 --> 09:35:39,810
So every time, we have to be going North-East.

16024
09:35:40,070 --> 09:35:40,210
Okay?

16025
09:35:40,570 --> 09:35:41,770
Okay, alright.

16026
09:35:41,850 --> 09:35:44,590
Happy birthday, Mr. Kimchi.

16027
09:35:45,090 --> 09:35:46,010
Man, say it.

16028
09:35:46,850 --> 09:35:48,090
North-East, North-East.

16029
09:35:48,150 --> 09:35:49,830
Say happy birthday to Mr. Kimchi.

16030
09:35:51,070 --> 09:35:51,850
Who's Kimchi?

16031
09:35:52,130 --> 09:35:54,190
I don't know, he's my dragoon in my chat.

16032
09:35:55,150 --> 09:35:56,330
Say happy birthday.

16033
09:35:56,770 --> 09:35:57,250
Nice, okay.

16034
09:35:57,250 --> 09:35:58,810
Say his name.

16035
09:35:59,970 --> 09:36:00,830
Mr. Kimchi.

16036
09:36:02,470 --> 09:36:03,370
There you go.

16037
09:36:03,550 --> 09:36:04,990
Thank you for the super chat, Mr. Kimchi.

16038
09:36:05,470 --> 09:36:06,450
Thank you, thank you.

16039
09:36:07,030 --> 09:36:08,350
We're not going...

16040
09:36:08,350 --> 09:36:09,590
Oh gosh, okay.

16041
09:36:09,770 --> 09:36:11,490
This is tougher than I...

16042
09:36:11,490 --> 09:36:13,550
What are the numbers?

16043
09:36:13,870 --> 09:36:15,090
We have to walk.

16044
09:36:15,730 --> 09:36:17,050
What are the numbers?

16045
09:36:18,630 --> 09:36:19,650
What do you mean the numbers?

16046
09:36:19,670 --> 09:36:20,850
Okay, we just need to go down.

16047
09:36:22,050 --> 09:36:22,810
That's fine.

16048
09:36:23,670 --> 09:36:24,730
Get out of the boat.

16049
09:36:24,810 --> 09:36:26,170
Get out of the boat.

16050
09:36:27,650 --> 09:36:28,690
Okay, let's go.

16051
09:36:28,950 --> 09:36:28,970
Okay.

16052
09:36:30,910 --> 09:36:31,430
Alright.

16053
09:36:33,730 --> 09:36:35,170
How many feathers do I have?

16054
09:36:35,230 --> 09:36:36,270
Oh, only eight feathers.

16055
09:36:36,450 --> 09:36:38,270
We'll find more, we'll find more.

16056
09:36:38,470 --> 09:36:41,110
We didn't fucking check for hay bales.

16057
09:36:42,270 --> 09:36:43,310
Oh no.

16058
09:36:44,450 --> 09:36:44,770
Okay.

16059
09:36:45,410 --> 09:36:46,350
I have...

16060
09:36:46,350 --> 09:36:47,970
I have 15...

16061
09:36:50,030 --> 09:36:50,550
15...

16062
09:36:50,550 --> 09:36:52,550
Okay, I have...

16063
09:36:53,490 --> 09:36:55,050
Wait, did you grab a bed yet or no?

16064
09:36:55,750 --> 09:36:56,870
Yeah, I've had my bed.

16065
09:36:57,390 --> 09:36:57,630
Oh.

16066
09:36:58,270 --> 09:37:00,070
How many membranes do you have?

16067
09:37:00,150 --> 09:37:00,670
I have one.

16068
09:37:01,270 --> 09:37:02,310
That's not enough.

16069
09:37:03,870 --> 09:37:05,310
Where are you going?

16070
09:37:05,390 --> 09:37:05,890
Come on.

16071
09:37:06,050 --> 09:37:06,810
This is the way.

16072
09:37:07,550 --> 09:37:08,850
Yes it is.

16073
09:37:09,370 --> 09:37:10,410
It's going down.

16074
09:37:12,010 --> 09:37:13,470
The numbers are both...

16075
09:37:13,470 --> 09:37:14,550
I'm going down too.

16076
09:37:16,790 --> 09:37:18,050
And I'm going up the mountain.

16077
09:37:18,050 --> 09:37:19,390
I'm at the...

16078
09:37:19,390 --> 09:37:20,570
Oh my god, okay.

16079
09:37:21,210 --> 09:37:23,490
Alright, alright, alright.

16080
09:37:23,910 --> 09:37:24,870
I wish I had...

16081
09:37:25,950 --> 09:37:26,730
Where are you?

16082
09:37:27,470 --> 09:37:27,970
What?

16083
09:37:28,310 --> 09:37:28,810
What happened?

16084
09:37:29,130 --> 09:37:31,210
Oh my god.

16085
09:37:32,550 --> 09:37:33,430
Who did you tame?

16086
09:37:33,610 --> 09:37:34,070
The dog?

16087
09:37:35,370 --> 09:37:36,670
Actually, this might be really good.

16088
09:37:36,810 --> 09:37:39,010
Because we need someone to kill the skellies.

16089
09:37:39,150 --> 09:37:39,730
Yeah, exactly.

16090
09:37:39,910 --> 09:37:40,730
Where are you?

16091
09:37:40,810 --> 09:37:41,890
I lost you already.

16092
09:37:42,150 --> 09:37:43,130
I already lost you.

16093
09:37:43,810 --> 09:37:45,250
Yeah, because you're focused on dog.

16094
09:37:47,510 --> 09:37:48,730
Why are you going up the mountain?

16095
09:37:48,890 --> 09:37:50,270
It makes the Z go up.

16096
09:37:50,790 --> 09:37:51,790
No it doesn't.

16097
09:37:51,810 --> 09:37:52,430
Yes it does.

16098
09:37:52,630 --> 09:37:56,090
I'm literally going up the mountain.

16099
09:37:56,470 --> 09:37:58,490
And my Z is going down.

16100
09:37:58,710 --> 09:37:59,410
Where are you?

16101
09:38:01,030 --> 09:38:02,130
It's this way.

16102
09:38:02,830 --> 09:38:03,530
Where are you?

16103
09:38:05,190 --> 09:38:06,550
I'm across the mountain.

16104
09:38:07,090 --> 09:38:08,050
We lost each other.

16105
09:38:08,450 --> 09:38:09,250
I'll meet you on the...

16106
09:38:09,250 --> 09:38:10,390
We lost each other.

16107
09:38:10,390 --> 09:38:11,970
We actually lost each other.

16108
09:38:15,750 --> 09:38:17,570
I'm going down the mountain.

16109
09:38:18,050 --> 09:38:19,310
Oh, there's water here.

16110
09:38:19,430 --> 09:38:20,290
We lost each other.

16111
09:38:20,830 --> 09:38:23,630
I'll give you my coordinates and you come to the water and then we boat.

16112
09:38:23,970 --> 09:38:25,250
I'm literally in the water.

16113
09:38:25,790 --> 09:38:26,650
Where are you?

16114
09:38:26,750 --> 09:38:27,390
Come to me.

16115
09:38:27,930 --> 09:38:28,750
What's your coordinates?

16116
09:38:29,150 --> 09:38:30,050
Oh, I see you.

16117
09:38:30,290 --> 09:38:32,110
Oh my god, we were heading the same way.

16118
09:38:33,170 --> 09:38:35,090
Wait, we can't take the boat.

16119
09:38:35,170 --> 09:38:35,790
Your dog.

16120
09:38:36,590 --> 09:38:37,290
He'll fall.

16121
09:38:37,410 --> 09:38:37,850
He'll TP.

16122
09:38:37,850 --> 09:38:38,810
He'll TP.

16123
09:38:40,110 --> 09:38:41,890
Alright, go, go, go.

16124
09:38:44,530 --> 09:38:45,630
Nope, wrong way.

16125
09:38:45,930 --> 09:38:46,950
It's going down!

16126
09:38:47,830 --> 09:38:49,130
It's going down!

16127
09:38:49,950 --> 09:38:50,390
No!

16128
09:38:51,610 --> 09:38:53,250
The X axis is not going down!

16129
09:38:54,370 --> 09:38:55,210
Oh my god.

16130
09:38:55,270 --> 09:38:56,290
We gotta get off the boat.

16131
09:38:56,370 --> 09:38:57,350
We gotta get off the boat.

16132
09:38:57,450 --> 09:38:58,610
We gotta get off the boat.

16133
09:38:58,870 --> 09:39:02,950
We go this way.

16134
09:39:03,290 --> 09:39:04,550
We go this way.

16135
09:39:04,550 --> 09:39:05,870
We go this way.

16136
09:39:05,870 --> 09:39:07,510
Oh my god.

16137
09:39:07,950 --> 09:39:08,930
We go this way.

16138
09:39:09,030 --> 09:39:09,730
We go northeast.

16139
09:39:10,070 --> 09:39:10,930
Just follow me.

16140
09:39:11,030 --> 09:39:11,810
Just follow me.

16141
09:39:12,390 --> 09:39:12,750
Northeast.

16142
09:39:13,430 --> 09:39:16,050
Northeast right here.

16143
09:39:16,550 --> 09:39:17,050
Northeast.

16144
09:39:20,270 --> 09:39:22,130
It's going down now.

16145
09:39:26,130 --> 09:39:28,270
No ghasts in sight.

16146
09:39:28,670 --> 09:39:29,590
This is a peaceful time.

16147
09:39:29,590 --> 09:39:31,390
It's just a peaceful day.

16148
09:39:31,390 --> 09:39:33,090
Yeah, we have piggies.

16149
09:39:33,310 --> 09:39:35,110
And dogs and sheep.

16150
09:39:35,450 --> 09:39:36,970
No ghasts, no lava.

16151
09:39:37,250 --> 09:39:38,410
I mean, sometimes maybe lava.

16152
09:39:38,730 --> 09:39:41,430
We just keep going down.

16153
09:39:42,430 --> 09:39:43,730
Look at that, there's my dog.

16154
09:39:45,610 --> 09:39:47,170
There he is.

16155
09:39:47,330 --> 09:39:51,110
A dog that is literally defying all physics and logic.

16156
09:39:52,070 --> 09:39:53,530
Oh my god, he's gonna start teleporting.

16157
09:39:54,850 --> 09:39:55,930
Our good little boy.

16158
09:39:56,030 --> 09:39:56,970
Be careful, there's a cave.

16159
09:39:57,130 --> 09:39:57,870
There's a hole here.

16160
09:39:57,870 --> 09:39:59,790
He's been teleporting?

16161
09:39:59,970 --> 09:40:01,030
He's been teleporting?

16162
09:40:01,890 --> 09:40:02,770
We never stop.

16163
09:40:03,090 --> 09:40:05,030
We never stop going.

16164
09:40:05,790 --> 09:40:07,810
This is...

16165
09:40:07,810 --> 09:40:10,790
What we did to find the fortress.

16166
09:40:11,170 --> 09:40:12,950
We found the fortress though.

16167
09:40:13,290 --> 09:40:14,230
Isn't that great?

16168
09:40:14,290 --> 09:40:16,710
We found the fortress though.

16169
09:40:17,430 --> 09:40:18,170
We found the fortress.

16170
09:40:18,170 --> 09:40:18,710
We found it.

16171
09:40:19,090 --> 09:40:20,690
We found the fortress.

16172
09:40:21,470 --> 09:40:22,730
Isn't that great?

16173
09:40:29,350 --> 09:40:30,770
Oh my god.

16174
09:40:31,390 --> 09:40:33,230
I feel like...

16175
09:40:33,230 --> 09:40:34,750
It's not going down.

16176
09:40:35,070 --> 09:40:37,250
I feel like...

16177
09:40:37,250 --> 09:40:38,730
I wish we had Elytra.

16178
09:40:41,630 --> 09:40:44,550
We need to go to the end for that.

16179
09:40:50,850 --> 09:40:52,850
Elysa's going down though.

16180
09:40:53,510 --> 09:40:56,550
I keep losing you, but I keep seeing your dog.

16181
09:40:56,550 --> 09:40:57,830
I'm just following your dog.

16182
09:40:58,170 --> 09:41:01,390
TP to me so I don't know what you're talking about.

16183
09:41:02,490 --> 09:41:04,450
How are you behind?

16184
09:41:06,090 --> 09:41:06,650
I'm right here.

16185
09:41:06,670 --> 09:41:08,710
I'm literally going...

16186
09:41:08,710 --> 09:41:11,390
I'm following the coordinates.

16187
09:41:12,250 --> 09:41:13,510
I'm following you.

16188
09:41:13,770 --> 09:41:15,010
Come on, make a path.

16189
09:41:16,650 --> 09:41:17,210
Jump.

16190
09:41:22,130 --> 09:41:24,110
What have I just made us jump to?

16191
09:41:24,110 --> 09:41:25,850
We have to do so much in this.

16192
09:41:25,950 --> 09:41:26,610
Oh my god.

16193
09:41:27,710 --> 09:41:29,890
We have to do so much.

16194
09:41:32,250 --> 09:41:34,510
Oh, the dog just shook off the water.

16195
09:41:34,650 --> 09:41:35,310
That's so cute.

16196
09:41:36,830 --> 09:41:39,770
That's why I've been trying to tame the dog this entire time.

16197
09:41:39,890 --> 09:41:40,730
Oh my god.

16198
09:41:40,850 --> 09:41:42,110
We need him for the night time.

16199
09:41:43,630 --> 09:41:47,450
I mean, we needed to farm other stuff anyway.

16200
09:41:47,890 --> 09:41:48,550
So it's alright.

16201
09:41:48,710 --> 09:41:50,190
We needed to farm the chickens.

16202
09:41:50,490 --> 09:41:52,150
We needed to farm the bookshelves.

16203
09:41:52,150 --> 09:41:55,150
We needed so many things.

16204
09:41:55,150 --> 09:41:55,690
It's alright.

16205
09:41:55,730 --> 09:41:57,310
Maybe we'll find another villager.

16206
09:41:57,890 --> 09:41:59,170
We found another villager.

16207
09:42:01,210 --> 09:42:02,710
We'll find another village somewhere.

16208
09:42:02,710 --> 09:42:02,810
We'll find another village somewhere.

16209
09:42:03,210 --> 09:42:04,130
We'll find it.

16210
09:42:04,490 --> 09:42:06,350
There's no way we won't find it.

16211
09:42:06,630 --> 09:42:07,610
Look, we're at 9k.

16212
09:42:07,730 --> 09:42:08,550
We're at 9k.

16213
09:42:08,910 --> 09:42:10,150
We're getting there.

16214
09:42:11,010 --> 09:42:11,350
Yeah.

16215
09:42:11,770 --> 09:42:14,070
But the 12k is scaring me.

16216
09:42:14,770 --> 09:42:15,790
Don't think about it.

16217
09:42:16,370 --> 09:42:18,610
It needs to be 4k.

16218
09:42:19,070 --> 09:42:19,990
Don't think about it.

16219
09:42:19,990 --> 09:42:21,570
It's not as bad as 4k.

16220
09:42:21,570 --> 09:42:22,370
Don't think about it.

16221
09:42:22,910 --> 09:42:24,430
It's negative 4k.

16222
09:42:24,510 --> 09:42:25,410
Don't think about it.

16223
09:42:25,650 --> 09:42:26,910
Yeah, negative 4k.

16224
09:42:26,930 --> 09:42:27,370
Don't go this way.

16225
09:42:27,410 --> 09:42:27,890
Don't go this way.

16226
09:42:28,470 --> 09:42:31,130
My coordinates almost blocked that for me.

16227
09:42:31,150 --> 09:42:33,730
My coordinates almost blocked that for me.

16228
09:42:34,890 --> 09:42:36,450
Uh oh, you just trapped your dog.

16229
09:42:36,650 --> 09:42:37,010
It's fine.

16230
09:42:37,090 --> 09:42:37,330
He'll come.

16231
09:42:37,470 --> 09:42:38,110
He'll tp out.

16232
09:42:38,170 --> 09:42:38,570
There he is.

16233
09:42:40,730 --> 09:42:41,510
He'll tp out.

16234
09:42:41,570 --> 09:42:42,270
It'll be fine.

16235
09:42:43,170 --> 09:42:44,110
It'll be fine.

16236
09:42:46,490 --> 09:42:47,650
It'll be fine.

16237
09:42:47,650 --> 09:42:49,470
It'll be so fine.

16238
09:42:49,730 --> 09:42:51,430
We keep moving forward.

16239
09:42:51,630 --> 09:42:53,310
We had to find bookshelves.

16240
09:42:53,670 --> 09:42:55,330
We had to get chicken feathers.

16241
09:42:55,690 --> 09:42:57,130
We had to get so many things.

16242
09:42:57,250 --> 09:42:59,090
This is all part of the plan.

16243
09:42:59,970 --> 09:43:01,930
Yeah, this is all part of the plan, everybody.

16244
09:43:02,530 --> 09:43:06,970
We had to get so many other resources anyway, so we might as well make the travel.

16245
09:43:07,450 --> 09:43:09,830
But from here on, we did the fortress.

16246
09:43:09,990 --> 09:43:11,790
We did the most difficult part, probably.

16247
09:43:12,150 --> 09:43:12,510
Hopefully.

16248
09:43:12,730 --> 09:43:13,830
Maybe that's the most difficult part.

16249
09:43:13,830 --> 09:43:17,170
We just have to get to the...

16250
09:43:18,530 --> 09:43:19,390
What's the thing?

16251
09:43:19,390 --> 09:43:20,810
Oh my god, we should've been farming sheep.

16252
09:43:20,950 --> 09:43:22,350
We should've been farming sheep for the bed.

16253
09:43:23,490 --> 09:43:24,830
You have a bed.

16254
09:43:25,650 --> 09:43:27,110
For the Ender Dragon!

16255
09:43:29,450 --> 09:43:31,150
Hold on, I'm gonna kill this chicken.

16256
09:43:32,250 --> 09:43:35,710
Okay, we can farm beds when we find more villages.

16257
09:43:35,830 --> 09:43:37,190
I feel like it's easier to just get wool.

16258
09:43:37,490 --> 09:43:39,250
Because we don't have enough inventory space anyway.

16259
09:43:39,530 --> 09:43:41,010
I feel like it'd just be easier.

16260
09:43:41,010 --> 09:43:42,710
I feel like it's just farm the sheep.

16261
09:43:42,830 --> 09:43:44,350
Do you have inventory space for sheep, wool?

16262
09:43:46,070 --> 09:43:46,470
Okay.

16263
09:43:47,030 --> 09:43:48,090
Alright, let's see.

16264
09:43:48,310 --> 09:43:49,670
What can I get rid of?

16265
09:43:50,510 --> 09:43:51,810
I'll farm the wool.

16266
09:43:52,330 --> 09:43:55,050
I mean, we don't have to do the bed strat, but...

16267
09:43:55,050 --> 09:43:57,010
I mean...

16268
09:43:57,010 --> 09:43:58,930
It's the safest right now.

16269
09:43:59,330 --> 09:44:00,510
Wait, someone sent me something.

16270
09:44:00,650 --> 09:44:02,270
And people are like, she needs to read this.

16271
09:44:04,350 --> 09:44:06,270
Oh, YouTube Live Archive.

16272
09:44:06,390 --> 09:44:07,930
Yes, we know about the 12 hours.

16273
09:44:07,930 --> 09:44:08,810
We know, we know.

16274
09:44:08,810 --> 09:44:10,230
We're only at 10!

16275
09:44:10,450 --> 09:44:11,770
We're at 10 hours!

16276
09:44:12,090 --> 09:44:14,910
We're not even thinking about this!

16277
09:44:16,130 --> 09:44:16,750
We're fine.

16278
09:44:17,230 --> 09:44:20,810
It takes us literally 10 minutes to make another room.

16279
09:44:21,570 --> 09:44:22,870
We'll be fine.

16280
09:44:23,030 --> 09:44:23,770
We'll be fine.

16281
09:44:25,330 --> 09:44:26,510
Where did you go?

16282
09:44:26,990 --> 09:44:27,870
I don't know.

16283
09:44:29,190 --> 09:44:30,910
Wait, you're still going?

16284
09:44:30,970 --> 09:44:31,970
I thought you were hunting sheep.

16285
09:44:32,050 --> 09:44:32,490
No, I'm not.

16286
09:44:32,670 --> 09:44:33,930
It was in the path.

16287
09:44:35,090 --> 09:44:35,590
No!

16288
09:44:36,090 --> 09:44:36,890
I lost you.

16289
09:44:36,890 --> 09:44:38,730
I'm making a peepee tower.

16290
09:44:38,810 --> 09:44:40,330
I'm making a peepee tower right now.

16291
09:44:40,330 --> 09:44:41,190
Oh, I see you.

16292
09:44:41,250 --> 09:44:42,890
Look up!

16293
09:44:45,450 --> 09:44:46,890
Don't keep going.

16294
09:44:47,770 --> 09:44:48,270
Wait for me.

16295
09:44:48,870 --> 09:44:50,310
Okay, just follow.

16296
09:44:50,590 --> 09:44:51,730
I'm gonna put red blocks.

16297
09:44:54,210 --> 09:44:56,230
Follow the red block road.

16298
09:44:56,390 --> 09:44:57,850
Follow the red block road.

16299
09:44:58,310 --> 09:45:00,370
Follow the red block road.

16300
09:45:02,470 --> 09:45:03,950
I gotta eat my bread.

16301
09:45:04,050 --> 09:45:05,510
I'm eating my bread.

16302
09:45:05,510 --> 09:45:07,450
Say thank you to super chat.

16303
09:45:07,570 --> 09:45:15,070
I placed all my very important belongings back home.

16304
09:45:15,070 --> 09:45:16,390
For some reason.

16305
09:45:16,750 --> 09:45:20,430
Yeah, I thought we would go back.

16306
09:45:20,770 --> 09:45:21,390
Silly me.

16307
09:45:22,230 --> 09:45:23,750
We were never coming back.

16308
09:45:24,150 --> 09:45:27,110
We had several blocks of lapis.

16309
09:45:27,310 --> 09:45:30,790
And we also had...

16310
09:45:30,790 --> 09:45:32,170
But it's okay.

16311
09:45:32,170 --> 09:45:33,850
We had to farm other stuff anyway.

16312
09:45:34,050 --> 09:45:35,150
We had to farm the wool.

16313
09:45:35,310 --> 09:45:36,330
We had to farm chicken.

16314
09:45:36,650 --> 09:45:37,870
We had to get bookshelves.

16315
09:45:38,110 --> 09:45:38,650
And it's okay.

16316
09:45:38,930 --> 09:45:39,550
It's okay.

16317
09:45:39,690 --> 09:45:40,750
That was part of the plan.

16318
09:45:44,850 --> 09:45:46,670
Is there anything else you want to add, Mint?

16319
09:45:46,750 --> 09:45:48,210
Is there anything else about my mistake?

16320
09:45:50,530 --> 09:45:59,830
I just want to say, there's no point in putting things in a chest if we just delete everything when we die.

16321
09:46:00,390 --> 09:46:04,750
I thought we were coming back.

16322
09:46:04,870 --> 09:46:06,510
I legitimately thought we were going to come back.

16323
09:46:06,690 --> 09:46:09,990
That it wouldn't take us 20 fucking years to get to a fortress.

16324
09:46:10,210 --> 09:46:12,650
I legitimately thought that we were more competent than that.

16325
09:46:12,870 --> 09:46:14,630
Defining a stupid fucking fortress.

16326
09:46:16,410 --> 09:46:19,350
It's so easy to get to the fortress.

16327
09:46:19,910 --> 09:46:23,050
It's so easy to find a fortress.

16328
09:46:23,310 --> 09:46:24,290
But don't silly me.

16329
09:46:24,390 --> 09:46:25,390
It wasn't easy.

16330
09:46:25,510 --> 09:46:28,570
It wasn't easy at all.

16331
09:46:29,750 --> 09:46:34,590
I think we just hit the negative luck with the fortress.

16332
09:46:37,110 --> 09:46:38,390
Just keep running.

16333
09:46:38,650 --> 09:46:39,470
Just keep running.

16334
09:46:40,390 --> 09:46:43,130
It's gonna be night time, but that's okay.

16335
09:46:43,650 --> 09:46:44,270
Sakura!

16336
09:46:46,350 --> 09:46:47,470
The cherry blossom trees.

16337
09:46:47,590 --> 09:46:47,750
Wow.

16338
09:46:47,770 --> 09:46:48,470
We don't need it.

16339
09:46:48,490 --> 09:46:49,690
It's not part of the speedrun.

16340
09:46:49,690 --> 09:46:50,830
Wait, oh my gosh.

16341
09:46:50,890 --> 09:46:51,850
There's another portal.

16342
09:46:52,110 --> 09:46:53,110
Broke another portal.

16343
09:46:55,950 --> 09:46:58,230
But it would be closer.

16344
09:46:59,230 --> 09:47:03,870
We're not gacha rolling 200 rolls.

16345
09:47:04,290 --> 09:47:07,190
I am not doing that again.

16346
09:47:07,430 --> 09:47:08,370
We don't have to.

16347
09:47:08,450 --> 09:47:09,950
We just have to find the original.

16348
09:47:12,510 --> 09:47:14,110
With all the ghasts.

16349
09:47:14,190 --> 09:47:16,390
With all the ghasts.

16350
09:47:16,870 --> 09:47:22,550
Get out of here, sheep.

16351
09:47:23,310 --> 09:47:24,390
Get out of here.

16352
09:47:26,370 --> 09:47:30,010
How about you go to the nether and I'll stay out here in the overworld?

16353
09:47:30,470 --> 09:47:30,690
What?

16354
09:47:30,770 --> 09:47:31,610
This is a team.

16355
09:47:31,730 --> 09:47:33,330
What are you trying to split us up for?

16356
09:47:36,650 --> 09:47:38,070
Are we going the right way?

16357
09:47:38,310 --> 09:47:39,330
Oh my god, I just fell.

16358
09:47:39,950 --> 09:47:40,430
Hold on.

16359
09:47:40,730 --> 09:47:41,710
I just fell.

16360
09:47:41,890 --> 09:47:42,490
Oh, I'm okay.

16361
09:47:42,790 --> 09:47:43,570
No, I'm not okay.

16362
09:47:43,750 --> 09:47:44,170
I'm okay.

16363
09:47:44,550 --> 09:47:45,050
I think I'm okay.

16364
09:47:45,610 --> 09:47:47,050
Okay, because I'm heading straight.

16365
09:47:47,250 --> 09:47:49,210
I'm still... I'll wait for you here.

16366
09:47:49,710 --> 09:47:50,890
No, I'm right behind you.

16367
09:47:51,690 --> 09:47:55,170
All right, I'm gonna get the coordinates out of my screen.

16368
09:47:55,910 --> 09:47:57,110
And I'm gonna head this way.

16369
09:47:57,250 --> 09:47:58,050
It's still the right way.

16370
09:47:58,150 --> 09:47:58,670
It's northeast.

16371
09:47:58,810 --> 09:48:00,090
I haven't stopped moving northeast.

16372
09:48:00,090 --> 09:48:01,670
We haven't stopped moving northeast.

16373
09:48:01,870 --> 09:48:03,530
Why does my screen do that?

16374
09:48:03,590 --> 09:48:08,510
We haven't stopped moving northeast, so like it's gonna be the right way.

16375
09:48:09,150 --> 09:48:10,450
I fell into water.

16376
09:48:10,630 --> 09:48:11,250
It's fine, guys.

16377
09:48:11,930 --> 09:48:15,270
I never thought I'd catch a stream that started at 5 a.m.

16378
09:48:15,690 --> 09:48:21,310
Oh my god, you got the spiders coming after us?

16379
09:48:21,330 --> 09:48:21,910
Oh, it's fine.

16380
09:48:22,030 --> 09:48:22,590
It's fine.

16381
09:48:22,670 --> 09:48:23,490
I'm going northeast.

16382
09:48:23,750 --> 09:48:24,570
There's the drowns.

16383
09:48:24,690 --> 09:48:25,550
I'm going northeast.

16384
09:48:26,170 --> 09:48:28,330
I'm going in the water.

16385
09:48:28,650 --> 09:48:30,930
That's my dog because I didn't get hit yet.

16386
09:48:31,330 --> 09:48:33,090
Okay, now the dog's gonna do something.

16387
09:48:33,210 --> 09:48:33,810
There he goes.

16388
09:48:33,810 --> 09:48:34,650
There he goes.

16389
09:48:34,810 --> 09:48:35,370
Go, dog.

16390
09:48:35,470 --> 09:48:35,690
Go.

16391
09:48:35,770 --> 09:48:38,050
I'm stuck in the fucking dirt now.

16392
09:48:40,510 --> 09:48:41,070
That's fine.

16393
09:48:41,130 --> 09:48:42,170
My dog will be okay.

16394
09:48:43,010 --> 09:48:43,650
Where are you?

16395
09:48:43,750 --> 09:48:44,090
Come on.

16396
09:48:44,610 --> 09:48:45,730
Oh, there's my dog.

16397
09:48:46,030 --> 09:48:46,710
Oh, there he is.

16398
09:48:46,770 --> 09:48:46,950
Okay.

16399
09:48:47,930 --> 09:48:48,310
What?

16400
09:48:48,470 --> 09:48:48,990
There's a hole here.

16401
09:48:49,110 --> 09:48:49,430
Did you kill your dog?

16402
09:48:49,490 --> 09:48:50,510
No, there's a hole here.

16403
09:48:50,550 --> 09:48:51,410
My dog's gonna be fine.

16404
09:48:52,410 --> 09:48:53,570
I'm just making sure.

16405
09:48:54,310 --> 09:48:55,310
Okay, I'm gonna check the coordinates.

16406
09:48:55,630 --> 09:48:57,210
Phantom, phantom, don't go.

16407
09:48:57,370 --> 09:48:57,630
Phantom.

16408
09:48:59,210 --> 09:49:00,590
Phantom, come from the sky.

16409
09:49:00,950 --> 09:49:01,790
I call thee.

16410
09:49:03,810 --> 09:49:05,770
I don't think he's coming down from the sky.

16411
09:49:06,350 --> 09:49:08,630
I thought I heard a creeper.

16412
09:49:09,050 --> 09:49:09,730
I'm heading...

16413
09:49:09,730 --> 09:49:11,210
Oh, there's so many chickens.

16414
09:49:11,530 --> 09:49:12,110
Oh, jeez.

16415
09:49:12,190 --> 09:49:12,670
And spitter.

16416
09:49:14,770 --> 09:49:16,170
Okay, all right.

16417
09:49:16,650 --> 09:49:17,530
Going northeast.

16418
09:49:19,510 --> 09:49:21,150
There's more chickens here.

16419
09:49:21,750 --> 09:49:23,510
I'm gonna make sure we're heading the right way.

16420
09:49:24,550 --> 09:49:25,630
Watch out for this.

16421
09:49:26,310 --> 09:49:27,070
Oh my god.

16422
09:49:27,550 --> 09:49:27,770
Ouch.

16423
09:49:27,970 --> 09:49:28,550
That's fine.

16424
09:49:32,250 --> 09:49:34,630
Get killed, skelly man.

16425
09:49:35,690 --> 09:49:38,130
Okay, it's this way.

16426
09:49:39,230 --> 09:49:39,930
Okay, I'm coming.

16427
09:49:40,350 --> 09:49:40,670
We're going.

16428
09:49:41,150 --> 09:49:42,610
Eating real quick.

16429
09:49:43,230 --> 09:49:44,810
Eating my... Me too, me too, me too.

16430
09:49:44,910 --> 09:49:46,190
Oh my god, my last bread.

16431
09:49:46,330 --> 09:49:47,010
It's my last bread.

16432
09:49:48,030 --> 09:49:49,670
All right, here we go.

16433
09:49:50,450 --> 09:49:51,450
To the moon we go.

16434
09:49:51,450 --> 09:49:52,230
Oh my god, it's my last bread.

16435
09:49:52,630 --> 09:49:53,670
Here, here, I'll make more.

16436
09:49:54,270 --> 09:49:54,830
No, it's okay.

16437
09:49:54,970 --> 09:49:56,410
I have lamb.

16438
09:49:56,570 --> 09:49:57,550
We can make some in the morning.

16439
09:49:57,750 --> 09:49:58,150
All right.

16440
09:49:59,070 --> 09:50:00,850
Where are the phantoms?

16441
09:50:01,290 --> 09:50:02,070
I don't know.

16442
09:50:02,970 --> 09:50:06,390
I think it's because I killed them, so they stopped spawning for a bit.

16443
09:50:07,510 --> 09:50:08,070
Oh, maybe.

16444
09:50:09,010 --> 09:50:11,370
We just can't sleep for days and days and days.

16445
09:50:11,430 --> 09:50:15,370
It just makes this let this play through longer, because we can't sleep.

16446
09:50:15,830 --> 09:50:17,510
Just everything goes by longer.

16447
09:50:18,670 --> 09:50:20,290
Oh my god.

16448
09:50:20,350 --> 09:50:21,010
Where is it?

16449
09:50:21,070 --> 09:50:21,750
Oh, there's a village.

16450
09:50:21,850 --> 09:50:22,310
There's a village.

16451
09:50:22,990 --> 09:50:24,730
We can see there's bookshelves.

16452
09:50:25,430 --> 09:50:25,910
Bookshelves.

16453
09:50:26,730 --> 09:50:27,210
Kill.

16454
09:50:27,410 --> 09:50:27,930
Oh my god.

16455
09:50:27,930 --> 09:50:28,510
It's fine.

16456
09:50:28,510 --> 09:50:30,730
I just want to get rid of... Whoops.

16457
09:50:31,410 --> 09:50:32,130
It's fine.

16458
09:50:32,270 --> 09:50:34,510
I have... He's okay.

16459
09:50:34,610 --> 09:50:36,410
I gave him bone and he doesn't want it.

16460
09:50:37,770 --> 09:50:39,030
Yeah, because he's injured.

16461
09:50:39,630 --> 09:50:43,410
No, if you give him bone, you should... He can like heal himself.

16462
09:50:43,910 --> 09:50:45,150
Oh, feed me?

16463
09:50:45,990 --> 09:50:46,310
Oh.

16464
09:50:47,630 --> 09:50:48,370
Oh my god.

16465
09:50:48,450 --> 09:50:49,470
Oh, there we go.

16466
09:50:49,790 --> 09:50:51,610
I interrupted something really personal.

16467
09:50:52,150 --> 09:50:52,310
Okay.

16468
09:50:52,690 --> 09:50:53,010
All right.

16469
09:50:53,050 --> 09:50:54,710
I want to see this zombie break down the door.

16470
09:51:05,340 --> 09:51:06,700
That's messed up.

16471
09:51:06,780 --> 09:51:07,500
Bookshelves!

16472
09:51:10,340 --> 09:51:10,340
Wow!

16473
09:51:10,620 --> 09:51:10,900
Wow!

16474
09:51:11,560 --> 09:51:12,180
Wow!

16475
09:51:12,740 --> 09:51:12,920
What?

16476
09:51:13,060 --> 09:51:13,620
What happened?

16477
09:51:14,220 --> 09:51:15,560
He didn't do shit!

16478
09:51:17,660 --> 09:51:18,380
Wow!

16479
09:51:19,100 --> 09:51:23,320
I literally let this guy... Does it just need books?

16480
09:51:23,680 --> 09:51:25,180
How do I farm bookshelves?

16481
09:51:26,180 --> 09:51:27,020
Yeah, it's fine.

16482
09:51:27,020 --> 09:51:27,020
I'm fine.

16483
09:51:27,020 --> 09:51:27,020
I'm fine.

16484
09:51:27,020 --> 09:51:27,020
I'm fine.

16485
09:51:27,020 --> 09:51:27,020
I'm fine.

16486
09:51:27,020 --> 09:51:27,020
I'm fine.

16487
09:51:27,020 --> 09:51:28,100
Stupid zombo!

16488
09:51:28,480 --> 09:51:29,120
Up here?

16489
09:51:29,560 --> 09:51:30,260
Didn't do anything.

16490
09:51:30,260 --> 09:51:31,220
There's bookshelves right here.

16491
09:51:31,420 --> 09:51:39,780
Wait, do I need like... Okay, so to get bookshelves, we need silk touch to make it so that they break as bookshelves.

16492
09:51:39,840 --> 09:51:41,260
Otherwise, they break as books.

16493
09:51:41,960 --> 09:51:42,480
Okay.

16494
09:51:43,260 --> 09:51:47,100
And then we need... Then we need... That doesn't give us as many books.

16495
09:51:47,600 --> 09:51:48,120
Okay.

16496
09:51:50,180 --> 09:51:50,700
Yeah.

16497
09:51:51,640 --> 09:51:54,100
So in the end... Yeah.

16498
09:51:54,220 --> 09:51:55,920
In the end, we just have to get the books.

16499
09:51:57,020 --> 09:51:58,480
Alright, let's just farm the books.

16500
09:51:58,600 --> 09:51:59,260
It's fine.

16501
09:51:59,400 --> 09:52:00,380
Just farm the books.

16502
09:52:00,560 --> 09:52:01,120
Who cares?

16503
09:52:01,360 --> 09:52:02,800
Just farm the books.

16504
09:52:03,060 --> 09:52:03,140
Yeah.

16505
09:52:03,240 --> 09:52:04,700
Oh, my dog woke him in.

16506
09:52:05,220 --> 09:52:06,600
Oh, that's the thing you need to read.

16507
09:52:06,660 --> 09:52:09,060
That's what you can do to read the... What do you mean you fucked it up?

16508
09:52:09,160 --> 09:52:10,840
You just already... Alright, it's fine.

16509
09:52:10,920 --> 09:52:11,220
It's fine.

16510
09:52:11,280 --> 09:52:11,620
It's fine.

16511
09:52:11,660 --> 09:52:11,980
It's fine.

16512
09:52:12,040 --> 09:52:12,300
It's fine.

16513
09:52:12,380 --> 09:52:13,420
I got the books.

16514
09:52:13,520 --> 09:52:14,220
I got the books.

16515
09:52:14,300 --> 09:52:14,960
I got books.

16516
09:52:15,560 --> 09:52:16,900
I got books.

16517
09:52:17,560 --> 09:52:19,060
Oh, I got the books.

16518
09:52:19,660 --> 09:52:20,760
We got the books.

16519
09:52:20,860 --> 09:52:23,860
We got the books.

16520
09:52:23,860 --> 09:52:25,320
How many books do we need?

16521
09:52:25,580 --> 09:52:27,240
How many books do we need?

16522
09:52:27,260 --> 09:52:27,920
A lot of books.

16523
09:52:28,040 --> 09:52:29,680
We need a whole ton of books.

16524
09:52:30,040 --> 09:52:32,760
Let's just... Let's just raid these villages.

16525
09:52:33,120 --> 09:52:35,660
Oh, and there's... And there's hay.

16526
09:52:35,860 --> 09:52:36,740
Let's go!

16527
09:52:38,600 --> 09:52:41,340
There's a lot of bread in this one, but I have no room.

16528
09:52:42,520 --> 09:52:43,840
You need the food anyway.

16529
09:52:46,040 --> 09:52:47,560
Oh, lots of potatoes.

16530
09:52:47,680 --> 09:52:48,380
Lots of apples.

16531
09:52:49,540 --> 09:52:50,880
Are there any more books?

16532
09:52:51,200 --> 09:52:52,140
Is there any more books?

16533
09:52:52,420 --> 09:52:53,900
Any more books for us?

16534
09:52:56,340 --> 09:52:58,700
We're... We're gonna grab the books.

16535
09:52:59,040 --> 09:53:00,680
We're gonna rob you.

16536
09:53:00,940 --> 09:53:02,380
We need it more than you.

16537
09:53:02,560 --> 09:53:04,400
What you gonna do with all these books?

16538
09:53:04,520 --> 09:53:06,840
There's another... There's another potion.

16539
09:53:09,240 --> 09:53:11,360
There's... There's a potion thing right here.

16540
09:53:11,460 --> 09:53:12,560
Do we need it?

16541
09:53:13,180 --> 09:53:14,340
Uh, yeah.

16542
09:53:14,540 --> 09:53:16,200
Just grab it if you have room.

16543
09:53:16,300 --> 09:53:17,420
Okay, let me see what I have.

16544
09:53:17,440 --> 09:53:17,780
Yeah, I do.

16545
09:53:18,040 --> 09:53:18,600
I do.

16546
09:53:18,740 --> 09:53:19,020
I do.

16547
09:53:19,080 --> 09:53:19,420
I do.

16548
09:53:19,480 --> 09:53:19,820
I do.

16549
09:53:20,000 --> 09:53:21,320
I'm gonna grab it.

16550
09:53:23,480 --> 09:53:24,260
Get in here.

16551
09:53:24,420 --> 09:53:27,080
Get in my... Get in my pocket.

16552
09:53:27,520 --> 09:53:29,420
Alright, are you ready to go?

16553
09:53:31,000 --> 09:53:31,400
Oh.

16554
09:53:33,140 --> 09:53:33,960
Oh my god.

16555
09:53:34,380 --> 09:53:39,140
This guy has four zombos and a little baby on a chicken attacking him.

16556
09:53:39,900 --> 09:53:41,200
Oh my god.

16557
09:53:41,260 --> 09:53:42,560
I'm not dealing with that.

16558
09:53:42,620 --> 09:53:43,500
That's not my job.

16559
09:53:43,560 --> 09:53:44,960
I was gonna lead him to the...

16560
09:53:46,620 --> 09:53:47,480
That's fine.

16561
09:53:47,720 --> 09:53:49,180
To the golem, but...

16562
09:53:51,140 --> 09:53:52,080
That's fine.

16563
09:53:52,720 --> 09:53:54,320
I need the levels anyway.

16564
09:53:54,500 --> 09:53:55,440
I need the... Oh, let's go!

16565
09:53:55,540 --> 09:53:55,980
Let's go!

16566
09:53:56,260 --> 09:53:56,580
Okay.

16567
09:53:57,320 --> 09:53:57,660
Okay.

16568
09:53:58,040 --> 09:53:58,760
Which way?

16569
09:53:59,040 --> 09:53:59,500
This way.

16570
09:54:00,120 --> 09:54:00,580
This way?

16571
09:54:00,580 --> 09:54:01,060
This way.

16572
09:54:01,140 --> 09:54:02,320
It's always northeast.

16573
09:54:02,700 --> 09:54:06,560
It's always northeast and we never change direction.

16574
09:54:07,240 --> 09:54:08,140
Never change.

16575
09:54:08,460 --> 09:54:08,980
Never change.

16576
09:54:09,100 --> 09:54:11,400
We are one directional girls.

16577
09:54:12,520 --> 09:54:13,500
We got books.

16578
09:54:13,700 --> 09:54:14,680
We got fetters.

16579
09:54:15,260 --> 09:54:17,400
We got... We got everything we need.

16580
09:54:17,480 --> 09:54:18,320
We got ambition.

16581
09:54:19,060 --> 09:54:21,140
We have strength and determination.

16582
09:54:22,400 --> 09:54:23,600
Oh my

16583
09:54:27,460 --> 09:54:27,580
god.

16584
09:54:27,620 --> 09:54:29,120
Look at all these pigs.

16585
09:54:30,680 --> 09:54:32,100
We keep moving forward.

16586
09:54:32,300 --> 09:54:34,840
We keep... We're... We keep moving forward.

16587
09:54:35,340 --> 09:54:38,160
Well, we're just... Look at all these chickens on our way.

16588
09:54:38,160 --> 09:54:40,080
Look, we're... We're killing time.

16589
09:54:40,500 --> 09:54:42,400
We're... We're... Oh my god.

16590
09:54:43,480 --> 09:54:43,920
No!

16591
09:54:44,000 --> 09:54:44,580
My dog!

16592
09:54:45,440 --> 09:54:46,140
No, he's alive.

16593
09:54:46,180 --> 09:54:46,580
He's alive.

16594
09:54:46,740 --> 09:54:48,060
Watch out for the other one though.

16595
09:54:48,320 --> 09:54:49,160
Okay, that's fine.

16596
09:54:49,280 --> 09:54:49,980
That's fine.

16597
09:54:52,340 --> 09:54:53,100
Where are you?

16598
09:54:53,420 --> 09:54:54,740
I'm right behind you.

16599
09:54:54,840 --> 09:54:55,740
I need meat though.

16600
09:54:56,360 --> 09:54:57,120
Is my dog okay?

16601
09:54:57,260 --> 09:54:58,860
Okay, I need to give him more meat soon.

16602
09:54:59,560 --> 09:55:00,220
Oh, shit.

16603
09:55:00,720 --> 09:55:01,880
I can also get another dog.

16604
09:55:02,720 --> 09:55:03,680
Get another dog.

16605
09:55:03,860 --> 09:55:04,800
Get another dog.

16606
09:55:05,180 --> 09:55:05,780
That's fine.

16607
09:55:05,860 --> 09:55:07,640
So if the other one dies, at least I have this one.

16608
09:55:08,700 --> 09:55:09,740
The dog army.

16609
09:55:10,000 --> 09:55:10,660
We got it.

16610
09:55:10,760 --> 09:55:11,300
It's at this point.

16611
09:55:11,420 --> 09:55:12,260
This is the only way.

16612
09:55:12,420 --> 09:55:13,140
Is this though?

16613
09:55:16,460 --> 09:55:19,820
Oh, breaking the... Oh, it gives all three books that went into the crafting.

16614
09:55:19,940 --> 09:55:20,500
Let's go!

16615
09:55:21,020 --> 09:55:21,740
Oh, okay.

16616
09:55:21,820 --> 09:55:22,400
Good, good, good.

16617
09:55:22,880 --> 09:55:23,300
That's good.

16618
09:55:23,340 --> 09:55:23,700
That's good.

16619
09:55:23,760 --> 09:55:24,080
That's good.

16620
09:55:24,140 --> 09:55:25,360
It's just... It's just the planks.

16621
09:55:25,460 --> 09:55:26,420
It's just whatever the wood...

16622
09:55:26,420 --> 09:55:27,180
It's fine.

16623
09:55:27,260 --> 09:55:27,680
It's fine.

16624
09:55:27,760 --> 09:55:28,260
We don't...

16625
09:55:28,260 --> 09:55:31,160
We're surrounded by trees.

16626
09:55:33,040 --> 09:55:33,760
It's fine.

16627
09:55:34,140 --> 09:55:35,620
Yeah, we're surrounded by trees.

16628
09:55:35,680 --> 09:55:36,480
We're not in the nether.

16629
09:55:36,640 --> 09:55:38,140
We can get everything we need.

16630
09:55:39,100 --> 09:55:42,000
We're... We're practically winning at this point.

16631
09:55:43,740 --> 09:55:45,600
I wish we had Elytras.

16632
09:55:45,960 --> 09:55:47,620
I wish we had Elytras.

16633
09:55:47,800 --> 09:55:50,520
I wish we could just fly.

16634
09:55:50,660 --> 09:55:54,180
I wish we could just fly, and then all our worries will disappear.

16635
09:55:54,960 --> 09:55:59,300
And then everything we've all worried about would just...

16636
09:55:59,300 --> 09:55:59,820
Oh, phantom!

16637
09:56:00,160 --> 09:56:00,840
Phantom, phantom!

16638
09:56:01,220 --> 09:56:02,740
Oh my God, who is it for?

16639
09:56:03,400 --> 09:56:04,140
I think it's me.

16640
09:56:04,820 --> 09:56:05,280
It's you.

16641
09:56:05,920 --> 09:56:06,920
I heard you yawning.

16642
09:56:08,160 --> 09:56:09,460
It did hear me yawning, actually.

16643
09:56:09,760 --> 09:56:11,740
I think it's gonna go soon, so we have to kill it quick.

16644
09:56:12,460 --> 09:56:13,500
What took you so long?

16645
09:56:13,780 --> 09:56:14,720
Oh, no, no, it's good.

16646
09:56:14,800 --> 09:56:15,020
It's good.

16647
09:56:15,040 --> 09:56:15,320
It's good.

16648
09:56:15,400 --> 09:56:15,840
He'll burn.

16649
09:56:15,940 --> 09:56:16,220
He'll burn.

16650
09:56:16,280 --> 09:56:16,640
He'll burn.

16651
09:56:16,960 --> 09:56:17,660
Okay, he'll burn.

16652
09:56:17,760 --> 09:56:17,980
He'll burn.

16653
09:56:18,040 --> 09:56:18,200
Yeah.

16654
09:56:18,840 --> 09:56:19,540
Just let him die.

16655
09:56:19,620 --> 09:56:20,140
Just let him die.

16656
09:56:21,600 --> 09:56:22,040
Come on.

16657
09:56:22,660 --> 09:56:23,020
Burn.

16658
09:56:23,620 --> 09:56:23,980
Burn.

16659
09:56:24,560 --> 09:56:25,140
Come on!

16660
09:56:25,700 --> 09:56:28,300
Give me your membranes!

16661
09:56:28,420 --> 09:56:29,760
Give me your membranes!

16662
09:56:32,420 --> 09:56:33,000
Give me your membranes!

16663
09:56:33,020 --> 09:56:34,220
He didn't give you membrane.

16664
09:56:37,560 --> 09:56:39,280
He didn't give you membrane.

16665
09:56:42,240 --> 09:56:42,780
We tried.

16666
09:56:43,080 --> 09:56:44,400
We tried our best.

16667
09:56:44,560 --> 09:56:44,880
We tried.

16668
09:56:45,000 --> 09:56:46,020
It's 7000!

16669
09:56:46,520 --> 09:56:48,240
Oh my God, 7000!

16670
09:56:48,440 --> 09:56:49,400
Look at us go!

16671
09:56:52,400 --> 09:56:53,800
We have to kill it ourselves.

16672
09:56:54,100 --> 09:56:54,260
Oh.

16673
09:56:54,700 --> 09:56:55,580
Well, now we know.

16674
09:56:56,060 --> 09:56:56,880
Now we know.

16675
09:56:57,060 --> 09:56:57,680
Now we know.

16676
09:56:58,060 --> 09:56:59,120
Now we know.

16677
09:56:59,340 --> 09:57:00,080
Now we know.

16678
09:57:00,140 --> 09:57:00,760
Look at that.

16679
09:57:01,120 --> 09:57:02,420
Get that gamer subs in you, Mint.

16680
09:57:02,480 --> 09:57:03,360
Get that gamer subs.

16681
09:57:03,500 --> 09:57:04,380
We're so close.

16682
09:57:05,340 --> 09:57:06,920
Mint, we're so close, Mint.

16683
09:57:06,980 --> 09:57:08,340
We are so close.

16684
09:57:08,740 --> 09:57:09,180
We're not.

16685
09:57:09,180 --> 09:57:10,200
We're not even.

16686
09:57:10,200 --> 09:57:10,880
We are.

16687
09:57:11,180 --> 09:57:12,440
Like, we nearly...

16688
09:57:12,440 --> 09:57:17,280
We nearly need to get our lapis, and then it's like we just speedrun to the end.

16689
09:57:17,620 --> 09:57:18,580
Like, and then we're there.

16690
09:57:18,760 --> 09:57:19,540
And then we're there.

16691
09:57:19,640 --> 09:57:22,600
The moment we, like, get to the area, we have...

16692
09:57:22,600 --> 09:57:24,320
We have to kill the dragon.

16693
09:57:24,500 --> 09:57:26,280
We have nothing to kill it with.

16694
09:57:26,560 --> 09:57:27,100
What do you mean?

16695
09:57:27,160 --> 09:57:28,020
What do you mean we have nothing?

16696
09:57:28,100 --> 09:57:29,360
We have so many things.

16697
09:57:29,460 --> 09:57:30,320
What do you mean?

16698
09:57:30,360 --> 09:57:31,880
We need the phantom membranes.

16699
09:57:31,880 --> 09:57:34,760
We will get the phantom membranes as we travel!

16700
09:57:35,580 --> 09:57:37,400
That's what traveling is for!

16701
09:57:37,980 --> 09:57:39,220
We only have one.

16702
09:57:42,120 --> 09:57:43,180
What do you mean?

16703
09:57:43,340 --> 09:57:44,900
How many phantom membranes do we need?

16704
09:57:45,000 --> 09:57:46,020
How many do we need?

16705
09:57:46,280 --> 09:57:48,440
We need a lot of slow falling.

16706
09:57:48,880 --> 09:57:50,940
How many do we need?

16707
09:57:51,020 --> 09:57:51,820
I don't know.

16708
09:57:52,420 --> 09:57:53,360
I don't know.

16709
09:57:54,320 --> 09:57:54,840
Actually...

16710
09:57:54,840 --> 09:57:55,820
Do we have redstone?

16711
09:57:56,420 --> 09:57:57,460
Oh my god.

16712
09:57:58,820 --> 09:58:02,120
We might need to grab... Well, some... It will make the potions last longer.

16713
09:58:02,480 --> 09:58:03,120
Oh my god.

16714
09:58:03,760 --> 09:58:05,080
Oh my god.

16715
09:58:06,020 --> 09:58:08,500
We have to go back to the...

16716
09:58:11,360 --> 09:58:14,740
You literally told me...

16717
09:58:14,740 --> 09:58:18,620
We threw away all our redstone because somebody...

16718
09:58:19,300 --> 09:58:19,740
Somebody...

16719
09:58:19,740 --> 09:58:20,920
We only need a little bit.

16720
09:58:20,980 --> 09:58:21,580
We don't need a lot.

16721
09:58:23,040 --> 09:58:24,760
Somebody was saying...

16722
09:58:24,760 --> 09:58:26,400
We don't need them.

16723
09:58:26,400 --> 09:58:28,180
All I was thinking of was...

16724
09:58:28,180 --> 09:58:30,020
All I was thinking of was...

16725
09:58:30,020 --> 09:58:31,820
Back to the mines we go, I guess.

16726
09:58:31,940 --> 09:58:33,480
Back to the mines we go.

16727
09:58:33,900 --> 09:58:34,760
Yeah, probably.

16728
09:58:35,080 --> 09:58:36,640
Why don't you go back to the mines?

16729
09:58:36,720 --> 09:58:38,040
You go back to the mines while...

16730
09:58:38,040 --> 09:58:38,920
You want me to do it?

16731
09:58:39,140 --> 09:58:40,280
You want me to go back?

16732
09:58:41,780 --> 09:58:42,660
We'll do it together.

16733
09:58:43,300 --> 09:58:43,860
We'll do it together.

16734
09:58:44,200 --> 09:58:44,680
We'll...

16735
09:58:45,280 --> 09:58:47,700
We'll work together to grab...

16736
09:58:47,700 --> 09:58:49,420
Grab the redstone.

16737
09:58:52,640 --> 09:58:53,120
Alright.

16738
09:58:53,960 --> 09:58:55,040
What does that mean?

16739
09:58:56,180 --> 09:58:57,040
Someone just said...

16740
09:58:57,040 --> 09:58:58,300
You guys are on a paper server.

16741
09:58:58,420 --> 09:59:00,240
Will things respawn more slowly?

16742
09:59:02,020 --> 09:59:03,480
Wait, what things spawn...

16743
09:59:03,840 --> 09:59:05,480
Doki, why did you choose a paper server?

16744
09:59:05,480 --> 09:59:07,500
I don't know what server we needed!

16745
09:59:10,580 --> 09:59:11,700
Does it really matter?

16746
09:59:12,020 --> 09:59:14,400
Does it really matter that things spawn in slowly?

16747
09:59:14,800 --> 09:59:15,180
Does it...

16748
09:59:15,180 --> 09:59:16,080
It's just the phantoms.

16749
09:59:16,180 --> 09:59:17,820
It literally is just the phantoms.

16750
09:59:18,020 --> 09:59:18,600
But those...

16751
09:59:18,600 --> 09:59:21,340
We need a lot of slow falling potions.

16752
09:59:25,460 --> 09:59:26,520
Oh my God.

16753
09:59:27,240 --> 09:59:28,280
Can you change it?

16754
09:59:28,580 --> 09:59:30,140
Can you change it?

16755
09:59:30,220 --> 09:59:31,020
I can change.

16756
09:59:31,120 --> 09:59:33,540
I think I can swap it, but I don't know if we keep the thing.

16757
09:59:33,580 --> 09:59:35,280
Wait, the Z is going up.

16758
09:59:35,800 --> 09:59:36,620
There's a mountain.

16759
09:59:36,740 --> 09:59:37,680
There is a mountain.

16760
09:59:46,290 --> 09:59:48,090
I'm trying to place my blocks here.

16761
09:59:48,710 --> 09:59:50,090
Did you know about the paper thing?

16762
09:59:50,210 --> 09:59:51,230
Did you know about it?

16763
09:59:51,830 --> 09:59:52,050
No.

16764
09:59:52,510 --> 09:59:55,470
Exactly, so even if you made the server...

16765
09:59:55,470 --> 09:59:58,190
Why are people telling us this at like...

16766
09:59:58,190 --> 09:59:59,490
10 hours into the game?

16767
09:59:59,830 --> 10:00:02,650
Even if you made that server, we will never...

16768
10:00:02,650 --> 10:00:03,510
They should have been like...

16769
10:00:03,510 --> 10:00:06,050
Paper was the default.

16770
10:00:06,450 --> 10:00:08,870
When we first started the game, they should have been like...

16771
10:00:08,870 --> 10:00:11,730
Hey, by the way, things are gonna spawn a little more slowly...

16772
10:00:11,730 --> 10:00:12,730
Because you choose this.

16773
10:00:13,070 --> 10:00:14,790
Okay, we'll just redo it.

16774
10:00:14,890 --> 10:00:16,450
Since we're not very far in.

16775
10:00:16,670 --> 10:00:18,950
But now that we're 10 hours into the stream...

16776
10:00:20,110 --> 10:00:20,450
It's okay.

16777
10:00:20,510 --> 10:00:21,550
Everything will be fine.

16778
10:00:21,630 --> 10:00:22,590
We'll just keep going northeast.

16779
10:00:23,010 --> 10:00:23,770
Just keep going.

16780
10:00:23,850 --> 10:00:26,930
We have not encountered anything bad yet.

16781
10:00:27,070 --> 10:00:28,210
Nothing bad has happened.

16782
10:00:28,330 --> 10:00:29,450
We just keep going northeast.

16783
10:00:29,890 --> 10:00:33,150
Nothing bad has happened so far.

16784
10:00:33,530 --> 10:00:34,230
Just keep...

16785
10:00:34,230 --> 10:00:35,230
Stop saying that.

16786
10:00:35,370 --> 10:00:36,170
You're scaring me.

16787
10:00:37,230 --> 10:00:37,870
Stop it.

16788
10:00:37,910 --> 10:00:38,770
Stop saying it.

16789
10:00:39,330 --> 10:00:40,270
There's another dog.

16790
10:00:40,330 --> 10:00:41,030
You want another pet?

16791
10:00:42,150 --> 10:00:43,490
Oh, I'm at the top of the mountain.

16792
10:00:43,690 --> 10:00:44,530
Okay, I don't need it.

16793
10:00:44,610 --> 10:00:45,090
We'll find more.

16794
10:00:45,210 --> 10:00:46,750
We have 10,000 more blocks to go.

16795
10:00:47,150 --> 10:00:49,130
I'm pretty sure we'll find another dog by then.

16796
10:00:49,490 --> 10:00:52,090
I'm pretty sure.

16797
10:00:52,330 --> 10:00:54,190
I wish I had some bones.

16798
10:00:55,670 --> 10:00:56,650
I told you.

16799
10:00:56,790 --> 10:00:59,590
I told you about keeping the bones.

16800
10:00:59,710 --> 10:01:01,850
You're like, Doki, get rid of the bones.

16801
10:01:01,970 --> 10:01:02,510
I was like, don't.

16802
10:01:03,110 --> 10:01:04,850
It's gonna be useful, I swear to God.

16803
10:01:04,970 --> 10:01:06,410
We're gonna need it.

16804
10:01:07,510 --> 10:01:08,510
And I was right.

16805
10:01:09,630 --> 10:01:10,330
Are you done?

16806
10:01:11,110 --> 10:01:11,470
No.

16807
10:01:13,270 --> 10:01:15,250
Are you even following me?

16808
10:01:15,310 --> 10:01:16,730
I don't even think you're following me anymore.

16809
10:01:16,990 --> 10:01:19,250
I'm like in my own world.

16810
10:01:19,290 --> 10:01:21,090
I don't think you're even following me anymore.

16811
10:01:21,210 --> 10:01:23,110
I don't think... I think we've lost each other.

16812
10:01:23,230 --> 10:01:24,490
I think we've lost each other.

16813
10:01:24,670 --> 10:01:25,850
But we're gonna be...

16814
10:01:26,370 --> 10:01:27,810
We're going the same way, right?

16815
10:01:27,890 --> 10:01:28,950
We're going the same way.

16816
10:01:28,950 --> 10:01:30,910
Yeah, but I'm in like the snowy area.

16817
10:01:31,450 --> 10:01:34,430
I have not seen a single snow area.

16818
10:01:35,010 --> 10:01:36,950
I have...

16819
10:01:37,590 --> 10:01:40,050
I don't know what you're talking about.

16820
10:01:40,170 --> 10:01:40,970
There has been...

16821
10:01:40,970 --> 10:01:43,410
Oh, I'm going up a little on the Z.

16822
10:01:43,950 --> 10:01:44,930
But there... I'm in the snow.

16823
10:01:46,190 --> 10:01:47,830
I'm scared of the powdered snow.

16824
10:01:48,530 --> 10:01:51,210
There has not been snow at all.

16825
10:01:53,110 --> 10:01:54,450
Mine is going down.

16826
10:01:54,750 --> 10:01:55,690
Mine is going down.

16827
10:01:55,690 --> 10:01:57,490
I'm going correctly northeast.

16828
10:02:02,360 --> 10:02:04,320
I have no idea what you're talking about.

16829
10:02:04,760 --> 10:02:05,000
I...

16830
10:02:06,060 --> 10:02:08,320
I have no idea what you're talking about.

16831
10:02:12,260 --> 10:02:13,440
I don't know.

16832
10:02:13,640 --> 10:02:14,480
There's a village.

16833
10:02:14,660 --> 10:02:15,400
I'm at a village.

16834
10:02:15,920 --> 10:02:17,320
I am at a village.

16835
10:02:18,180 --> 10:02:19,540
Yep, I am at a regular village.

16836
10:02:19,760 --> 10:02:20,580
I am here.

16837
10:02:21,900 --> 10:02:24,040
One of us went the wrong way.

16838
10:02:24,500 --> 10:02:26,140
No, mine is going down.

16839
10:02:26,600 --> 10:02:27,840
One of us is...

16840
10:02:27,840 --> 10:02:29,100
You missed the village.

16841
10:02:29,200 --> 10:02:30,280
You missed the village.

16842
10:02:30,400 --> 10:02:32,060
Well, you can hang out at the village.

16843
10:02:32,820 --> 10:02:34,400
Somebody is trying to get books now.

16844
10:02:34,780 --> 10:02:35,920
Somebody is trying to get books for us.

16845
10:02:36,360 --> 10:02:38,020
I'm trying to get to our home.

16846
10:02:39,380 --> 10:02:40,920
I like how you call it our home.

16847
10:02:41,980 --> 10:02:43,640
When it's just...

16848
10:02:43,640 --> 10:02:44,700
We have no home.

16849
10:02:44,900 --> 10:02:46,000
We have no home.

16850
10:02:46,300 --> 10:02:47,640
We have no home.

16851
10:02:49,600 --> 10:02:51,580
I just want to drop down.

16852
10:02:51,760 --> 10:02:52,880
Okay, now I found the snow.

16853
10:02:53,060 --> 10:02:54,000
Now I know where you're at.

16854
10:02:54,000 --> 10:02:55,700
You're way behind me though.

16855
10:02:55,700 --> 10:02:56,360
No, no, no.

16856
10:02:56,460 --> 10:02:57,600
I know exactly where you're at.

16857
10:02:57,600 --> 10:02:58,980
You're in the mountain behind me.

16858
10:02:59,620 --> 10:02:59,820
What?

16859
10:03:00,640 --> 10:03:02,940
There's snow here.

16860
10:03:03,000 --> 10:03:04,920
I see a giant mountain filled with snow.

16861
10:03:05,720 --> 10:03:07,300
I passed the mountain.

16862
10:03:08,760 --> 10:03:10,320
Wait, there's several mountains.

16863
10:03:11,060 --> 10:03:12,940
Wait, there's several mountains.

16864
10:03:14,040 --> 10:03:15,220
Wait a minute.

16865
10:03:15,900 --> 10:03:16,820
How many mountains?

16866
10:03:17,180 --> 10:03:17,980
What is your coordinate?

16867
10:03:18,280 --> 10:03:19,780
Negative 10,000.

16868
10:03:21,940 --> 10:03:23,340
Where are you?

16869
10:03:23,780 --> 10:03:25,820
Negative 9,500.

16870
10:03:28,020 --> 10:03:29,660
You went through there.

16871
10:03:29,660 --> 10:03:31,040
You're behind me.

16872
10:03:31,620 --> 10:03:34,220
You're behind me in that past mountain.

16873
10:03:34,480 --> 10:03:35,580
That's where you are.

16874
10:03:37,340 --> 10:03:38,880
Do you want me to wait for you?

16875
10:03:39,100 --> 10:03:39,420
No, no.

16876
10:03:39,480 --> 10:03:40,040
Just keep going.

16877
10:03:42,340 --> 10:03:44,940
We're both going the same path.

16878
10:03:45,500 --> 10:03:46,080
We're going the same path.

16879
10:03:46,220 --> 10:03:48,860
We're going the same path anyways.

16880
10:03:48,860 --> 10:03:50,100
It doesn't really matter.

16881
10:03:50,440 --> 10:03:52,260
We're just gonna meet up.

16882
10:04:03,330 --> 10:04:05,850
I'm at negative 9,000 now.

16883
10:04:10,510 --> 10:04:13,190
By the time we get there, we'll have all our materials.

16884
10:04:13,450 --> 10:04:14,770
We'll have everything we ever wanted.

16885
10:04:14,770 --> 10:04:15,730
I don't think I'm strong enough.

16886
10:04:16,630 --> 10:04:18,570
We'll have everything we want.

16887
10:04:19,110 --> 10:04:22,170
This is why those other streamers have so many subscribers.

16888
10:04:22,330 --> 10:04:23,150
I'm not strong enough.

16889
10:04:23,150 --> 10:04:25,230
We'll have...

16890
10:04:25,230 --> 10:04:27,190
Just think about how good it's gonna feel.

16891
10:04:27,430 --> 10:04:28,310
Just think about that.

16892
10:04:28,310 --> 10:04:29,390
What if we die?

16893
10:04:30,310 --> 10:04:31,690
Don't say that.

16894
10:04:32,970 --> 10:04:34,790
What if we die to the dragon?

16895
10:04:35,850 --> 10:04:36,850
Don't say that.

16896
10:04:37,290 --> 10:04:38,170
Don't say that.

16897
10:04:38,170 --> 10:04:41,590
What if we die to the dragon?

16898
10:04:42,090 --> 10:04:43,850
Please don't say that.

16899
10:04:44,330 --> 10:04:44,870
We want...

16900
10:04:46,250 --> 10:04:47,390
We want...

16901
10:04:47,770 --> 10:04:50,240
Don't say that.

16902
10:04:50,240 --> 10:04:51,380
I'm tired.

16903
10:04:51,380 --> 10:04:53,560
We have to go to sleep.

16904
10:04:54,000 --> 10:04:57,240
We already invested so much time.

16905
10:04:57,440 --> 10:05:00,560
What if we wake up and then we play more tomorrow?

16906
10:05:00,580 --> 10:05:02,520
We wake up in the morning.

16907
10:05:03,280 --> 10:05:07,920
We're gonna be sleeping for a very long time.

16908
10:05:08,740 --> 10:05:11,160
I can't sleep for a long time.

16909
10:05:11,260 --> 10:05:12,780
I have a flight to catch.

16910
10:05:13,580 --> 10:05:16,680
Then it'll make the sleeping so much more worth it.

16911
10:05:17,080 --> 10:05:23,360
When we beat the ender dragon, it'll make it so much more worth it.

16912
10:05:23,440 --> 10:05:26,000
Just think about how good it's gonna feel.

16913
10:05:26,420 --> 10:05:27,040
Just don't.

16914
10:05:27,620 --> 10:05:28,200
I'm gonna need this.

16915
10:05:29,600 --> 10:05:32,540
I'm gonna need this just in case I fall into snow.

16916
10:05:33,100 --> 10:05:33,800
Powdered snow.

16917
10:05:33,940 --> 10:05:35,040
Watch out for powdered snow.

16918
10:05:35,180 --> 10:05:36,360
Make sure you have an empty bucket.

16919
10:05:37,980 --> 10:05:39,060
Okay, nevermind.

16920
10:05:39,640 --> 10:05:42,300
You can fall in for a...

16921
10:05:42,300 --> 10:05:44,280
Get a whole face full of snow.

16922
10:05:46,580 --> 10:05:47,660
I'm in.

16923
10:05:48,300 --> 10:05:48,860
I'm in.

16924
10:05:49,280 --> 10:05:50,520
This is how I might die.

16925
10:05:50,800 --> 10:05:51,900
What are you talking about?

16926
10:05:52,100 --> 10:05:53,240
The powdered snow.

16927
10:05:53,480 --> 10:05:54,460
This might be it.

16928
10:05:55,420 --> 10:05:56,220
You don't have a bucket?

16929
10:05:57,240 --> 10:05:58,400
No, I don't.

16930
10:05:58,540 --> 10:06:00,280
I gave you all my iron.

16931
10:06:05,720 --> 10:06:06,200
Okay,

16932
10:06:10,400 --> 10:06:10,960
I'll wait for you.

16933
10:06:11,500 --> 10:06:13,920
No, I'm not close.

16934
10:06:14,420 --> 10:06:16,160
What are you at?

16935
10:06:16,160 --> 10:06:17,680
Get up, man.

16936
10:06:18,360 --> 10:06:19,220
What are you at?

16937
10:06:19,800 --> 10:06:21,440
I'm so cold.

16938
10:06:22,420 --> 10:06:23,700
Where are you at?

16939
10:06:23,820 --> 10:06:24,780
Tell me your coordinates.

16940
10:06:25,240 --> 10:06:29,920
I'm at negative 9,706,639.

16941
10:06:31,740 --> 10:06:33,940
Oh, you're like further on the Z than me.

16942
10:06:34,320 --> 10:06:35,520
Oh, yeah, I went to the Z.

16943
10:06:35,640 --> 10:06:36,880
I focused on the Z.

16944
10:06:40,570 --> 10:06:41,950
I'm focusing on the Z.

16945
10:06:44,130 --> 10:06:45,630
I might actually be able to find you.

16946
10:06:45,630 --> 10:06:46,470
Are you on the ice?

16947
10:06:47,510 --> 10:06:49,090
I'm on the ice area.

16948
10:06:50,510 --> 10:06:51,550
Just farming.

16949
10:06:52,530 --> 10:06:53,450
You're farming?

16950
10:06:53,830 --> 10:06:54,330
No, no, no.

16951
10:06:54,970 --> 10:06:56,730
I'm getting up on the...

16952
10:06:56,730 --> 10:07:00,250
I'm gonna get up on the trees.

16953
10:07:00,370 --> 10:07:01,330
I'm getting up on the trees.

16954
10:07:01,870 --> 10:07:02,390
Why?

16955
10:07:02,730 --> 10:07:04,490
So I can not die from snow!

16956
10:07:04,870 --> 10:07:05,770
What do you mean why?

16957
10:07:06,670 --> 10:07:07,970
No, you're fine.

16958
10:07:08,170 --> 10:07:09,670
It's not all snow.

16959
10:07:10,490 --> 10:07:11,690
There's a lot of snow.

16960
10:07:11,690 --> 10:07:12,770
I'm making a PP tower.

16961
10:07:12,770 --> 10:07:13,910
There's a lot of snow.

16962
10:07:15,090 --> 10:07:16,370
I'm making a PP tower.

16963
10:07:16,630 --> 10:07:18,210
I'm just going through the snow.

16964
10:07:18,330 --> 10:07:20,450
I'm traveling through the snow right now.

16965
10:07:20,790 --> 10:07:22,770
I'm protecting myself for the night.

16966
10:07:24,270 --> 10:07:25,870
In case a phantom comes through.

16967
10:07:27,710 --> 10:07:29,310
I'm just making a bridge.

16968
10:07:29,470 --> 10:07:31,070
I'm just gonna make a bridge.

16969
10:07:31,590 --> 10:07:33,630
I'm just gonna make a bridge.

16970
10:07:34,190 --> 10:07:35,230
I'm gonna make a bridge.

16971
10:07:35,290 --> 10:07:37,830
If a phantom hits me, then GG's.

16972
10:07:38,210 --> 10:07:39,070
Where are you?

16973
10:07:39,070 --> 10:07:41,070
Come to 9152.

16974
10:07:43,910 --> 10:07:45,390
I'm just gonna make a bridge.

16975
10:07:45,490 --> 10:07:47,830
I'm just gonna make the bridge.

16976
10:07:48,110 --> 10:07:50,110
I'm just gonna make the bridge and head straight.

16977
10:07:50,270 --> 10:07:52,790
I'm just gonna head straight.

16978
10:07:53,010 --> 10:07:53,930
Wait, what's your Z?

16979
10:07:56,590 --> 10:07:57,030
6653.

16980
10:07:57,550 --> 10:07:58,350
Okay, I'm close.

16981
10:07:58,870 --> 10:08:00,570
You're gonna see me.

16982
10:08:00,690 --> 10:08:01,290
I'm a bridge.

16983
10:08:01,390 --> 10:08:02,670
I'm basically a bridge.

16984
10:08:02,850 --> 10:08:04,190
I'm basically a bridge.

16985
10:08:04,270 --> 10:08:05,090
You're gonna see me.

16986
10:08:05,170 --> 10:08:05,730
I'm up here.

16987
10:08:05,730 --> 10:08:06,830
Come on.

16988
10:08:07,230 --> 10:08:08,650
I don't know.

16989
10:08:08,870 --> 10:08:09,710
I'm making bridges.

16990
10:08:09,850 --> 10:08:11,370
I'm not looking at anything else.

16991
10:08:11,930 --> 10:08:11,990
Sky bridge.

16992
10:08:12,350 --> 10:08:13,750
It's the real strength.

16993
10:08:14,270 --> 10:08:16,850
I'm making a sky bridge right now.

16994
10:08:16,870 --> 10:08:18,730
Yeah, sky bridge lives.

16995
10:08:21,770 --> 10:08:23,630
It lives on.

16996
10:08:23,790 --> 10:08:24,990
It lives on.

16997
10:08:25,030 --> 10:08:26,050
It lives on.

16998
10:08:28,210 --> 10:08:31,730
I'm at 9630.

16999
10:08:32,950 --> 10:08:34,650
Okay, I'm 500 blocks.

17000
10:08:36,270 --> 10:08:38,090
Okay, just look up in the sky.

17001
10:08:38,250 --> 10:08:39,590
You'll see the speed bridge.

17002
10:08:40,410 --> 10:08:42,850
I don't know if it's a speed bridge.

17003
10:08:43,290 --> 10:08:44,830
I think that is a little bit.

17004
10:08:45,750 --> 10:08:48,210
Just look up and you'll find the bridge.

17005
10:08:50,270 --> 10:08:52,070
Oh my gosh, I just got peach over.

17006
10:08:52,990 --> 10:08:54,050
If I fall, it's over.

17007
10:08:54,170 --> 10:08:55,110
I just need you to know that.

17008
10:08:55,190 --> 10:08:56,550
If I fall, it's over.

17009
10:08:57,050 --> 10:08:58,470
How tall did you go?

17010
10:08:59,090 --> 10:09:01,370
I went up the tree and...

17011
10:09:01,370 --> 10:09:02,890
Holy shit!

17012
10:09:02,890 --> 10:09:04,850
It's so over.

17013
10:09:05,650 --> 10:09:06,430
What happened?

17014
10:09:06,670 --> 10:09:07,130
Did you die?

17015
10:09:07,250 --> 10:09:09,630
If I fall, it's over.

17016
10:09:09,870 --> 10:09:12,650
If I get hit by the phantom, it's over.

17017
10:09:13,210 --> 10:09:14,010
Oh my God.

17018
10:09:14,910 --> 10:09:16,930
Oh my God, don't do it.

17019
10:09:16,970 --> 10:09:17,590
Don't do it.

17020
10:09:18,010 --> 10:09:19,350
It's too late.

17021
10:09:19,790 --> 10:09:21,090
The sky bridge is dangerous.

17022
10:09:21,290 --> 10:09:22,110
It's too late.

17023
10:09:22,230 --> 10:09:26,070
I have to push my dogs down.

17024
10:09:26,450 --> 10:09:28,310
If I want to live.

17025
10:09:30,050 --> 10:09:32,670
The phantoms are gonna knock you off.

17026
10:09:33,130 --> 10:09:34,970
The phantoms are gonna come.

17027
10:09:35,290 --> 10:09:36,350
The phantoms.

17028
10:09:36,770 --> 10:09:37,750
I have a boat.

17029
10:09:37,930 --> 10:09:39,030
I have a boat.

17030
10:09:39,250 --> 10:09:39,450
Let's go.

17031
10:09:39,450 --> 10:09:40,350
Use your boat.

17032
10:09:41,230 --> 10:09:44,090
Use your boat.

17033
10:09:44,190 --> 10:09:44,990
Use your boat.

17034
10:09:45,550 --> 10:09:47,870
I built a little platform.

17035
10:09:48,250 --> 10:09:50,310
If I fall, I might...

17036
10:09:51,090 --> 10:09:52,490
I'll take some damage.

17037
10:09:52,790 --> 10:09:54,010
Goodbye boat.

17038
10:09:54,390 --> 10:09:54,830
Goodbye.

17039
10:09:54,830 --> 10:09:54,950
Goodbye.

17040
10:09:56,030 --> 10:09:57,490
What do you mean goodbye boat?

17041
10:09:57,670 --> 10:10:00,950
I can make another boat.

17042
10:10:01,090 --> 10:10:01,710
It's fine.

17043
10:10:04,670 --> 10:10:06,090
Oh my God.

17044
10:10:06,390 --> 10:10:07,750
I have a skelly shooting at me.

17045
10:10:10,230 --> 10:10:11,570
How did he see me?

17046
10:10:12,010 --> 10:10:13,770
I'm gonna make another boat right now.

17047
10:10:14,030 --> 10:10:14,670
Just in case.

17048
10:10:17,210 --> 10:10:18,510
Just in case.

17049
10:10:19,190 --> 10:10:19,770
Freak.

17050
10:10:20,250 --> 10:10:22,110
Don't look at my house.

17051
10:10:22,110 --> 10:10:23,070
It's my sky house.

17052
10:10:23,650 --> 10:10:24,650
What do I have?

17053
10:10:24,750 --> 10:10:25,510
Okay, there you go.

17054
10:10:26,330 --> 10:10:27,670
I'm waiting to see you.

17055
10:10:28,170 --> 10:10:29,110
I don't know, man.

17056
10:10:29,190 --> 10:10:31,130
I'm 9500 right now.

17057
10:10:32,610 --> 10:10:34,070
It's because you're going so slow.

17058
10:10:34,090 --> 10:10:35,210
Because of your sky bridge.

17059
10:10:36,350 --> 10:10:37,610
Okay, I fucking...

17060
10:10:37,610 --> 10:10:40,270
I have more Zs.

17061
10:10:40,330 --> 10:10:41,670
I have more Zs.

17062
10:10:42,670 --> 10:10:43,670
What's your Zs?

17063
10:10:44,490 --> 10:10:45,530
Wait, it's this way.

17064
10:10:45,790 --> 10:10:48,550
It is at... Oh my God, there's a creeper right here.

17065
10:10:48,650 --> 10:10:48,770
Okay.

17066
10:10:48,770 --> 10:10:52,490
It is at 6680.

17067
10:10:53,890 --> 10:10:56,910
Okay, I'm at 6665.

17068
10:10:57,070 --> 10:10:59,230
So, if you just keep going...

17069
10:10:59,230 --> 10:11:00,770
Towards the positive X...

17070
10:11:01,330 --> 10:11:02,810
And you don't move much of the Z...

17071
10:11:02,810 --> 10:11:03,990
Then we'll run into each other.

17072
10:11:05,050 --> 10:11:05,370
Okay.

17073
10:11:06,390 --> 10:11:07,310
Well, you're gonna see.

17074
10:11:08,190 --> 10:11:12,010
Please, people, if you are trying to endurance this stream with us...

17075
10:11:12,010 --> 10:11:12,770
Do not do that.

17076
10:11:12,850 --> 10:11:14,230
If you need to sleep...

17077
10:11:14,230 --> 10:11:15,530
If you need to...

17078
10:11:15,530 --> 10:11:16,530
It's gonna be a while.

17079
10:11:16,710 --> 10:11:17,790
It's gonna be a while, guys.

17080
10:11:18,170 --> 10:11:19,810
It's gonna be a while.

17081
10:11:20,230 --> 10:11:21,330
It's gonna be a while.

17082
10:11:21,750 --> 10:11:23,670
You do not have to stay up with us.

17083
10:11:23,810 --> 10:11:24,470
Please do not.

17084
10:11:25,830 --> 10:11:26,970
We're still going.

17085
10:11:27,210 --> 10:11:28,830
We're still here.

17086
10:11:30,970 --> 10:11:31,590
It's fine.

17087
10:11:32,310 --> 10:11:34,070
I am 9300.

17088
10:11:35,550 --> 10:11:36,690
Someone said this was gonna...

17089
10:11:36,690 --> 10:11:38,490
They thought this was gonna be a quick watch.

17090
10:11:40,690 --> 10:11:42,290
Yeah, we thought so too.

17091
10:11:42,290 --> 10:11:44,990
It took us 30 years to find the fortress.

17092
10:11:45,510 --> 10:11:46,470
3 hours...

17093
10:11:46,470 --> 10:11:47,830
4 hours was stuck in the nether.

17094
10:11:47,950 --> 10:11:50,050
I think we had 4 hours of nether time.

17095
10:11:53,310 --> 10:11:56,570
Literally, 4 hours was just in the nether.

17096
10:11:56,810 --> 10:11:57,310
In hell.

17097
10:11:57,310 --> 10:11:59,750
Maybe we should start whispering for people who are going to sleep.

17098
10:11:59,790 --> 10:12:00,050
No.

17099
10:12:02,310 --> 10:12:03,450
Goodnight, everybody.

17100
10:12:04,050 --> 10:12:05,650
I'm at 9200.

17101
10:12:05,950 --> 10:12:06,590
Where are you?

17102
10:12:08,790 --> 10:12:09,290
9151.

17103
10:12:09,990 --> 10:12:10,450
Okay.

17104
10:12:12,310 --> 10:12:13,590
I should see you soon.

17105
10:12:13,710 --> 10:12:15,430
Unless you're higher in the sky than I am.

17106
10:12:16,150 --> 10:12:17,480
6500 is my other...

17107
10:12:19,790 --> 10:12:20,250
6500...

17108
10:12:20,250 --> 10:12:21,650
Oh, I might be a little off.

17109
10:12:22,690 --> 10:12:24,190
What's your Z again?

17110
10:12:26,490 --> 10:12:26,950
6665.

17111
10:12:27,370 --> 10:12:27,750
Okay.

17112
10:12:28,210 --> 10:12:29,470
I need to go this way.

17113
10:12:29,790 --> 10:12:31,410
Okay, we'll bump into each other.

17114
10:12:33,230 --> 10:12:34,750
Okay, I'll meet you there.

17115
10:12:35,810 --> 10:12:36,890
I'm on my boat.

17116
10:12:36,890 --> 10:12:38,190
I got off my boat.

17117
10:12:39,490 --> 10:12:40,210
Oh my god.

17118
10:12:40,310 --> 10:12:42,930
I can't move because skellies are targeting me.

17119
10:12:43,190 --> 10:12:45,130
There has been no skellies on my end.

17120
10:12:46,090 --> 10:12:47,870
I'm not as high as you.

17121
10:12:48,190 --> 10:12:48,830
I think.

17122
10:12:49,590 --> 10:12:50,930
No, I'm just in the ice.

17123
10:12:51,690 --> 10:12:52,190
No, dog.

17124
10:12:53,830 --> 10:12:55,110
Wait, I thought you were...

17125
10:12:55,110 --> 10:12:56,510
I thought you were in the air.

17126
10:12:56,730 --> 10:12:57,850
No, I fucking made a boat.

17127
10:12:57,930 --> 10:12:58,610
I lost my boat.

17128
10:12:58,650 --> 10:13:00,850
My dog got on the boat and I lost the boat.

17129
10:13:02,450 --> 10:13:02,890
What?

17130
10:13:04,070 --> 10:13:05,870
I lost my boat that I made.

17131
10:13:05,990 --> 10:13:07,030
Oh, you're on the ground now.

17132
10:13:07,170 --> 10:13:08,210
Yeah, I'm on the ground.

17133
10:13:08,350 --> 10:13:09,310
Where are you?

17134
10:13:09,630 --> 10:13:10,650
I'm in the sky.

17135
10:13:10,850 --> 10:13:11,770
I made a peepee tower.

17136
10:13:14,170 --> 10:13:16,330
I've been waiting in the peepee tower.

17137
10:13:16,930 --> 10:13:20,310
Okay, this is a little awkward because I am definitely not there anymore.

17138
10:13:20,510 --> 10:13:21,610
Wait, come over here.

17139
10:13:21,910 --> 10:13:23,830
I was looking at the sky for you.

17140
10:13:24,050 --> 10:13:25,450
I told you I got in the boat.

17141
10:13:27,790 --> 10:13:29,150
I'm in the sky.

17142
10:13:29,610 --> 10:13:31,130
No, why would I...

17143
10:13:31,130 --> 10:13:31,710
Why?

17144
10:13:32,270 --> 10:13:33,990
Okay, why would I do that?

17145
10:13:34,210 --> 10:13:36,870
Because if you fall, then you wouldn't take damage in the boat.

17146
10:13:37,630 --> 10:13:39,170
I've used the boat to fall.

17147
10:13:39,190 --> 10:13:39,790
We literally did that all through the desert.

17148
10:13:39,810 --> 10:13:42,010
I used the boat to fall off.

17149
10:13:42,390 --> 10:13:43,170
And then head...

17150
10:13:43,170 --> 10:13:44,210
I was in the ground.

17151
10:13:44,410 --> 10:13:46,550
I used the boat to fall off.

17152
10:13:47,150 --> 10:13:48,810
Okay, I'm gonna jump for it then.

17153
10:13:48,890 --> 10:13:50,010
And I'm gonna swim your way.

17154
10:13:50,130 --> 10:13:55,810
Okay, negative 9,041 and 6,581.

17155
10:13:56,150 --> 10:13:56,610
Oh, God.

17156
10:13:57,090 --> 10:13:57,470
Oh, shit.

17157
10:13:57,470 --> 10:13:59,550
Oh, my God.

17158
10:14:02,070 --> 10:14:02,830
I made it.

17159
10:14:02,970 --> 10:14:04,550
What happened?

17160
10:14:05,130 --> 10:14:06,010
You fell off.

17161
10:14:06,130 --> 10:14:08,850
I thought you were on your boat.

17162
10:14:08,950 --> 10:14:09,510
What happened?

17163
10:14:09,850 --> 10:14:10,950
I don't have a boat.

17164
10:14:15,720 --> 10:14:17,720
I'm gonna keep going.

17165
10:14:17,760 --> 10:14:19,140
No, wait for me.

17166
10:14:19,800 --> 10:14:21,040
I waited for you.

17167
10:14:23,300 --> 10:14:24,620
I don't have a boat.

17168
10:14:24,740 --> 10:14:26,000
I'm slow in the water.

17169
10:14:27,360 --> 10:14:29,020
Don't you have wood?

17170
10:14:29,400 --> 10:14:31,660
We had so many wood.

17171
10:14:34,540 --> 10:14:34,980
What?

17172
10:14:35,320 --> 10:14:36,080
What happened to the wood?

17173
10:14:36,400 --> 10:14:38,120
What happened to the wood?

17174
10:14:39,660 --> 10:14:41,280
I guess I can make one.

17175
10:14:43,300 --> 10:14:45,560
I'm at negative 9,045.

17176
10:14:45,580 --> 10:14:46,740
Okay, I don't care anymore.

17177
10:14:47,500 --> 10:14:49,520
If you're not waiting for me, I don't care anymore.

17178
10:14:49,520 --> 10:14:49,980
I didn't say...

17179
10:14:49,980 --> 10:14:50,520
Oh, my God.

17180
10:14:51,040 --> 10:14:52,500
I have phantoms.

17181
10:14:52,620 --> 10:14:53,240
I hope you're happy.

17182
10:14:53,320 --> 10:14:54,440
I got the phantoms for you.

17183
10:14:55,120 --> 10:14:56,260
They're looking at me.

17184
10:14:56,740 --> 10:14:59,440
Good thing you didn't get them while you were...

17185
10:15:00,100 --> 10:15:01,240
high up in the air.

17186
10:15:01,240 --> 10:15:02,160
Whatever the hell you were.

17187
10:15:02,700 --> 10:15:03,940
And there's zombies!

17188
10:15:08,060 --> 10:15:08,880
Oh, my God.

17189
10:15:08,980 --> 10:15:10,720
I think one of my dogs is gonna die.

17190
10:15:11,040 --> 10:15:12,080
My solo journey.

17191
10:15:13,540 --> 10:15:14,900
Not by choice, though.

17192
10:15:17,200 --> 10:15:19,820
I think that's a signal of a new day.

17193
10:15:19,960 --> 10:15:22,080
Whenever my shaders do that.

17194
10:15:22,300 --> 10:15:22,940
You're funky.

17195
10:15:24,320 --> 10:15:24,980
Oh, my God.

17196
10:15:25,060 --> 10:15:25,980
Sorry, doggos.

17197
10:15:26,040 --> 10:15:27,520
I don't have meat for you yet.

17198
10:15:32,540 --> 10:15:33,440
Oh, my God.

17199
10:15:33,440 --> 10:15:33,660
Where are they?

17200
10:15:34,160 --> 10:15:34,880
Get down!

17201
10:15:35,020 --> 10:15:35,960
I'm gonna use my bow.

17202
10:15:36,040 --> 10:15:37,240
I'm gonna use my bow.

17203
10:15:37,480 --> 10:15:38,420
She's gonna use her bow.

17204
10:15:39,440 --> 10:15:40,120
I did it.

17205
10:15:41,480 --> 10:15:42,400
I used my bow.

17206
10:15:42,560 --> 10:15:43,180
I couldn't.

17207
10:15:43,260 --> 10:15:44,580
I cannot deal with this anymore.

17208
10:15:45,440 --> 10:15:45,580
No.

17209
10:15:47,380 --> 10:15:49,500
I think this one gives me a membrane.

17210
10:15:50,160 --> 10:15:51,820
I think only one of them gives you a membrane.

17211
10:15:55,300 --> 10:15:55,920
Oh, my God.

17212
10:15:56,280 --> 10:15:56,940
Leave me alone.

17213
10:15:57,040 --> 10:15:57,400
Oh, my God.

17214
10:15:57,400 --> 10:15:57,860
Oh, my God.

17215
10:15:58,560 --> 10:16:01,260
Wait, I have two more?

17216
10:16:03,620 --> 10:16:04,520
Oh, my God.

17217
10:16:05,140 --> 10:16:06,180
Please, leave me alone.

17218
10:16:06,300 --> 10:16:07,220
I don't care about your child.

17219
10:16:07,320 --> 10:16:08,260
I don't care about your child.

17220
10:16:18,800 --> 10:16:19,520
What happened?

17221
10:16:20,280 --> 10:16:21,520
It burned to death.

17222
10:16:22,100 --> 10:16:24,320
Oh, bad luck.

17223
10:16:24,420 --> 10:16:24,740
Oh, my God.

17224
10:16:24,820 --> 10:16:25,220
No, baby.

17225
10:16:25,380 --> 10:16:25,620
No, baby.

17226
10:16:25,720 --> 10:16:26,380
No, baby.

17227
10:16:28,860 --> 10:16:29,220
Okay,

17228
10:16:33,100 --> 10:16:33,500
I'm okay.

17229
10:16:36,260 --> 10:16:36,340
Oh, my God.

17230
10:16:39,060 --> 10:16:40,520
It burned to death.

17231
10:16:42,580 --> 10:16:43,540
It's fine.

17232
10:16:43,660 --> 10:16:44,580
It's fine.

17233
10:16:44,680 --> 10:16:47,200
Why do all of these polar bears have babies?

17234
10:16:48,860 --> 10:16:49,540
I don't know.

17235
10:16:49,680 --> 10:16:50,200
I don't know.

17236
10:16:51,440 --> 10:16:52,820
Four, six, eight.

17237
10:16:52,920 --> 10:16:56,080
Okay, I have enough for a furnace.

17238
10:16:56,540 --> 10:16:57,420
I'm gonna make a furnace.

17239
10:16:57,660 --> 10:16:58,620
I'm waiting for you.

17240
10:16:58,640 --> 10:16:59,940
I'm waiting for you right here.

17241
10:17:01,120 --> 10:17:02,820
I'm making a furnace right now.

17242
10:17:02,820 --> 10:17:05,100
And then I'm gonna...

17243
10:17:05,100 --> 10:17:07,140
I told you my thing.

17244
10:17:07,340 --> 10:17:07,960
Don't worry.

17245
10:17:08,040 --> 10:17:09,240
Let me put stuff in here.

17246
10:17:09,540 --> 10:17:09,900
Oh, my God.

17247
10:17:09,940 --> 10:17:10,580
Please drown.

17248
10:17:10,740 --> 10:17:11,500
Please, please, please.

17249
10:17:11,820 --> 10:17:12,520
Leave me alone.

17250
10:17:13,460 --> 10:17:15,120
Do dogs eat chicken?

17251
10:17:16,740 --> 10:17:17,300
I don't know.

17252
10:17:18,700 --> 10:17:19,840
I'm not talking to you.

17253
10:17:20,920 --> 10:17:22,280
Negative 9,000.

17254
10:17:23,260 --> 10:17:24,960
46 and 6,500.

17255
10:17:25,680 --> 10:17:26,360
Okay, they do.

17256
10:17:27,020 --> 10:17:28,780
I'm kind of way beyond you.

17257
10:17:29,020 --> 10:17:30,380
Okay, that's fine.

17258
10:17:30,380 --> 10:17:32,040
I'll just keep going.

17259
10:17:32,380 --> 10:17:33,640
I'm just gonna keep going.

17260
10:17:34,440 --> 10:17:36,960
I only have 4,000 blocks left.

17261
10:17:37,180 --> 10:17:37,800
Oh, you do?

17262
10:17:37,960 --> 10:17:38,240
Okay.

17263
10:17:40,040 --> 10:17:41,020
How about you?

17264
10:17:42,300 --> 10:17:42,780
Alright.

17265
10:17:45,260 --> 10:17:46,860
Oh, raw meat is fine?

17266
10:17:47,000 --> 10:17:48,460
Fuck, I don't need to cook this meat.

17267
10:17:50,040 --> 10:17:50,660
Oh, my God.

17268
10:17:54,580 --> 10:17:55,640
Okay, are they fully healed?

17269
10:17:56,440 --> 10:17:57,300
Okay, they are.

17270
10:17:57,360 --> 10:17:58,160
Alright, that's fine.

17271
10:17:59,720 --> 10:18:01,320
I'm in the ocean pool, everybody.

17272
10:18:02,500 --> 10:18:03,220
Advancement made?

17273
10:18:03,480 --> 10:18:04,120
Oh, shit!

17274
10:18:04,180 --> 10:18:04,900
They made a baby.

17275
10:18:05,120 --> 10:18:05,360
Okay.

17276
10:18:07,020 --> 10:18:08,540
Wait, can I have him?

17277
10:18:08,940 --> 10:18:10,680
No, he's my baby.

17278
10:18:11,700 --> 10:18:11,940
Oh.

17279
10:18:12,740 --> 10:18:13,940
You said I could have a dog.

17280
10:18:14,680 --> 10:18:16,340
You can find your own dog.

17281
10:18:17,280 --> 10:18:18,920
Okay, I'm finally like...

17282
10:18:18,920 --> 10:18:19,800
out of the ice.

17283
10:18:20,680 --> 10:18:25,500
I was gonna say there's no blocking, but I think I just hit a...

17284
10:18:25,500 --> 10:18:26,860
Yep, I just hit a block.

17285
10:18:27,220 --> 10:18:28,220
Wait, how long did it take?

17286
10:18:28,220 --> 10:18:29,280
How long did it take?

17287
10:18:29,940 --> 10:18:30,940
I don't know.

17288
10:18:31,200 --> 10:18:33,760
I'm at negative 8,500.

17289
10:18:34,540 --> 10:18:36,060
Okay, what about your Z?

17290
10:18:38,560 --> 10:18:39,680
5,260.

17291
10:18:42,240 --> 10:18:44,080
Wait for me, Doki!

17292
10:18:44,360 --> 10:18:45,240
Wait for me!

17293
10:18:45,940 --> 10:18:47,420
I tried waiting for you!

17294
10:18:47,980 --> 10:18:49,440
I tried waiting for you!

17295
10:18:49,720 --> 10:18:52,400
I stood still!

17296
10:18:52,540 --> 10:18:53,360
I waited for you!

17297
10:18:53,440 --> 10:18:55,620
I dealt with the phantoms while waiting for you!

17298
10:18:55,620 --> 10:18:58,000
Wait for me, Doki!

17299
10:18:58,680 --> 10:19:00,140
Wait for me!

17300
10:19:01,120 --> 10:19:03,260
I was like, okay, I'll wait for you.

17301
10:19:03,340 --> 10:19:04,520
Okay, I'll wait for you.

17302
10:19:04,680 --> 10:19:06,720
Come to my location.

17303
10:19:07,120 --> 10:19:08,040
No, it's fine.

17304
10:19:08,080 --> 10:19:09,020
Just keep going.

17305
10:19:09,080 --> 10:19:09,960
Just keep going at this point.

17306
10:19:11,620 --> 10:19:12,500
It's fine.

17307
10:19:13,360 --> 10:19:15,640
I found the biggest cave ever.

17308
10:19:15,860 --> 10:19:17,060
What if I just dropped him?

17309
10:19:21,470 --> 10:19:23,230
Where are we dropping, boys?

17310
10:19:23,990 --> 10:19:25,070
In this cave.

17311
10:19:27,850 --> 10:19:28,170
Okay.

17312
10:19:30,230 --> 10:19:31,850
I'm at 8,600.

17313
10:19:33,030 --> 10:19:34,270
But I'm still in ice.

17314
10:19:34,870 --> 10:19:37,110
I'm still in ice.

17315
10:19:37,170 --> 10:19:39,470
Go to the 5,000 Z then.

17316
10:19:39,630 --> 10:19:40,970
And you'll get into the regular land.

17317
10:19:45,890 --> 10:19:46,490
Alright.

17318
10:19:47,370 --> 10:19:47,970
Alright.

17319
10:19:50,310 --> 10:19:52,090
I'm waiting with some cows.

17320
10:19:53,310 --> 10:19:54,810
Oh, you're gonna wait this time?

17321
10:19:55,170 --> 10:19:55,830
Yeah, I'm waiting.

17322
10:19:55,830 --> 10:19:57,150
No, just keep going.

17323
10:19:57,630 --> 10:19:58,470
It's fine.

17324
10:19:58,530 --> 10:19:59,950
We're all going to the same place anyway.

17325
10:20:00,170 --> 10:20:02,650
We're going to the same place.

17326
10:20:03,010 --> 10:20:03,590
I'm waiting.

17327
10:20:04,090 --> 10:20:06,130
Oh, I think I...

17328
10:20:06,130 --> 10:20:07,170
Oh, I hear a zombie.

17329
10:20:07,710 --> 10:20:08,130
How?

17330
10:20:08,810 --> 10:20:11,790
I think he's underneath me in the cave.

17331
10:20:12,150 --> 10:20:13,090
The giant cave.

17332
10:20:15,010 --> 10:20:15,970
I think I see...

17333
10:20:16,530 --> 10:20:17,690
Is that a pirate ship?

17334
10:20:22,310 --> 10:20:22,870
What?

17335
10:20:25,830 --> 10:20:26,590
Polar bear.

17336
10:20:27,490 --> 10:20:29,290
Yeah, avoid their babies.

17337
10:20:29,490 --> 10:20:30,730
Yeah, I fucking...

17338
10:20:31,530 --> 10:20:33,450
Swam into the polar bear.

17339
10:20:34,870 --> 10:20:36,090
That's your kind.

17340
10:20:36,290 --> 10:20:37,290
You wear the polar bear.

17341
10:20:37,470 --> 10:20:38,490
You wear the bear outfit.

17342
10:20:39,230 --> 10:20:40,490
I'm a grizzly bear.

17343
10:20:40,890 --> 10:20:42,170
We're different.

17344
10:20:43,470 --> 10:20:44,370
It's still a bear.

17345
10:20:44,970 --> 10:20:45,550
Oh, yeah?

17346
10:20:45,810 --> 10:20:48,190
Just because we're bears, we're all the same?

17347
10:20:48,530 --> 10:20:49,850
Yeah, bear bears.

17348
10:20:49,970 --> 10:20:51,050
We bear bears.

17349
10:20:52,670 --> 10:20:53,410
It's just propaganda.

17350
10:20:53,970 --> 10:20:56,150
Oh, I thought that was you, but it was a cow.

17351
10:21:02,130 --> 10:21:04,230
Oh my god, we're losing it.

17352
10:21:04,270 --> 10:21:05,930
We're actually losing it.

17353
10:21:06,130 --> 10:21:06,630
I'm at...

17354
10:21:06,630 --> 10:21:07,830
Wait, what are the numbers?

17355
10:21:08,690 --> 10:21:11,070
I'm at negative 8,000...

17356
10:21:11,070 --> 10:21:12,250
No, not that.

17357
10:21:12,330 --> 10:21:13,330
I'm talking about...

17358
10:21:13,330 --> 10:21:14,410
What is the OG?

17359
10:21:15,210 --> 10:21:17,410
Oh, negative 4,116.

17360
10:21:20,450 --> 10:21:21,570
1,576.

17361
10:21:22,230 --> 10:21:23,290
Negative what?

17362
10:21:25,390 --> 10:21:26,590
4,116.

17363
10:21:26,850 --> 10:21:27,810
I'm in the ice.

17364
10:21:27,990 --> 10:21:28,950
I'm in the ice.

17365
10:21:28,970 --> 10:21:31,990
And the Z is 1,576.

17366
10:21:32,050 --> 10:21:33,450
We're just a couple thousands away.

17367
10:21:35,590 --> 10:21:36,950
I'm in the ice.

17368
10:21:37,070 --> 10:21:38,330
I thought it was over.

17369
10:21:39,350 --> 10:21:41,890
I thought the ice stuff was over.

17370
10:21:42,130 --> 10:21:43,710
I thought it was over.

17371
10:21:43,930 --> 10:21:45,690
I was there before ice.

17372
10:21:46,010 --> 10:21:47,270
I'm on land.

17373
10:21:47,270 --> 10:21:47,470
I'm on land.

17374
10:21:49,350 --> 10:21:51,190
I might die.

17375
10:21:51,350 --> 10:21:52,770
I actually might die.

17376
10:21:52,910 --> 10:21:54,810
Why are you gonna die?

17377
10:21:54,990 --> 10:21:56,270
You're just on ice.

17378
10:21:56,570 --> 10:21:58,350
I'm in ice.

17379
10:21:58,450 --> 10:22:00,270
My dogs are dying in ice.

17380
10:22:00,370 --> 10:22:01,110
I'm sorry.

17381
10:22:02,910 --> 10:22:04,190
Goodbye, doggos.

17382
10:22:04,910 --> 10:22:06,310
They can die.

17383
10:22:06,430 --> 10:22:06,950
It's fine.

17384
10:22:07,070 --> 10:22:08,390
Just as long as you stay alive.

17385
10:22:10,610 --> 10:22:13,130
Goodbye, my fellow doggos.

17386
10:22:13,490 --> 10:22:14,130
Goodbye.

17387
10:22:14,130 --> 10:22:16,730
I hear them dying in the ice.

17388
10:22:16,910 --> 10:22:17,190
I'm sorry.

17389
10:22:17,190 --> 10:22:18,850
How are they in the ice?

17390
10:22:19,470 --> 10:22:20,570
I'm sorry.

17391
10:22:20,750 --> 10:22:22,670
How are you in the ice?

17392
10:22:23,090 --> 10:22:23,690
I'm sorry.

17393
10:22:24,310 --> 10:22:27,150
I didn't know.

17394
10:22:29,770 --> 10:22:32,050
Goodbye, my doggos.

17395
10:22:32,330 --> 10:22:34,390
Goodbye, my doggos.

17396
10:22:34,410 --> 10:22:36,490
I'm like two steps away from the ice.

17397
10:22:36,590 --> 10:22:37,150
Where are you?

17398
10:22:37,250 --> 10:22:38,210
What's your coordinate?

17399
10:22:38,910 --> 10:22:41,290
We're gonna see a doggo die in the ice.

17400
10:22:42,250 --> 10:22:44,630
We're gonna see it happen.

17401
10:22:44,730 --> 10:22:47,030
I don't have any more meat.

17402
10:22:47,550 --> 10:22:50,350
I don't have any more meat.

17403
10:22:50,730 --> 10:22:51,570
Why is he dying?

17404
10:22:51,950 --> 10:22:54,250
Because he's dying in the ice.

17405
10:22:54,510 --> 10:22:55,410
What does that mean?

17406
10:22:56,490 --> 10:22:58,730
Why don't you just move and they teleport?

17407
10:23:00,130 --> 10:23:02,070
Oh, the baby died.

17408
10:23:02,210 --> 10:23:02,490
Okay.

17409
10:23:02,830 --> 10:23:05,730
Why don't you just move and they teleport with you?

17410
10:23:05,890 --> 10:23:08,710
Because I was also trapped in the ice.

17411
10:23:08,790 --> 10:23:09,590
What do you want me to say?

17412
10:23:09,590 --> 10:23:11,070
What do you want me to say?

17413
10:23:11,090 --> 10:23:12,910
Why are you trapped in the ice?

17414
10:23:14,430 --> 10:23:16,050
What do you want me to say?

17415
10:23:16,310 --> 10:23:17,810
How are you trapped in the ice?

17416
10:23:17,830 --> 10:23:19,610
You just go around it.

17417
10:23:21,070 --> 10:23:22,710
It's already too late.

17418
10:23:22,810 --> 10:23:23,770
The baby's dead.

17419
10:23:23,930 --> 10:23:24,390
It's alright.

17420
10:23:24,790 --> 10:23:25,210
Oh wait, no.

17421
10:23:25,230 --> 10:23:25,730
He's alive.

17422
10:23:25,870 --> 10:23:26,310
Hello there.

17423
10:23:27,170 --> 10:23:27,690
See?

17424
10:23:27,950 --> 10:23:28,870
Everything's fine.

17425
10:23:29,090 --> 10:23:30,150
Come to my location.

17426
10:23:30,530 --> 10:23:31,650
What's your location?

17427
10:23:32,030 --> 10:23:35,390
I'm at negative 8,559.

17428
10:23:35,650 --> 10:23:37,390
5,265.

17429
10:23:38,330 --> 10:23:38,890
Alright.

17430
10:23:39,250 --> 10:23:41,530
Anyway, I'm at negative 8,300 now.

17431
10:23:41,530 --> 10:23:42,470
Oh, you're in the powered snow.

17432
10:23:43,010 --> 10:23:44,830
See, I told you you needed a bucket.

17433
10:23:45,930 --> 10:23:47,610
You took all my iron.

17434
10:23:47,770 --> 10:23:48,270
What did you want?

17435
10:23:48,270 --> 10:23:49,470
You gave me all your iron.

17436
10:23:49,470 --> 10:23:51,150
You took all my iron.

17437
10:23:51,410 --> 10:23:54,430
What did you want from me?

17438
10:23:55,810 --> 10:23:56,850
I'm not there.

17439
10:23:56,970 --> 10:23:58,390
I'm not going where you are.

17440
10:23:58,550 --> 10:23:59,510
I'm gone.

17441
10:24:00,150 --> 10:24:01,250
Just go.

17442
10:24:02,470 --> 10:24:03,030
Fine!

17443
10:24:03,550 --> 10:24:03,790
Fine!

17444
10:24:03,790 --> 10:24:05,450
I was here!

17445
10:24:07,330 --> 10:24:07,750
I told you!

17446
10:24:07,950 --> 10:24:09,130
I told you.

17447
10:24:09,530 --> 10:24:10,570
Just go.

17448
10:24:10,830 --> 10:24:11,750
Fine, I'm going.

17449
10:24:13,090 --> 10:24:16,090
It's almost night time and I'm scared.

17450
10:24:16,430 --> 10:24:17,210
No, you're not.

17451
10:24:18,030 --> 10:24:18,730
Where's the baby?

17452
10:24:19,810 --> 10:24:20,870
There you go.

17453
10:24:21,110 --> 10:24:23,510
I'm trying to give the baby some meat right now.

17454
10:24:24,790 --> 10:24:27,030
The last meat that I have.

17455
10:24:27,250 --> 10:24:29,810
This is why you're not supposed to have animals.

17456
10:24:30,090 --> 10:24:31,130
You have no attachments.

17457
10:24:31,390 --> 10:24:33,570
I did not want them to breed!

17458
10:24:33,570 --> 10:24:36,510
They just got close to each other.

17459
10:24:36,670 --> 10:24:37,970
They got close to each other.

17460
10:24:38,090 --> 10:24:40,390
And they just want me to stop love?

17461
10:24:40,390 --> 10:24:41,150
That's why you neutered them!

17462
10:24:41,170 --> 10:24:43,350
You want me to stop love?

17463
10:24:43,850 --> 10:24:44,950
You have to cut off their bones.

17464
10:24:44,970 --> 10:24:45,770
Where's the doctors?

17465
10:24:46,010 --> 10:24:48,290
We've been in the wilds for 20 years.

17466
10:24:48,570 --> 10:24:50,670
Where can I go to the doctors?

17467
10:24:50,990 --> 10:24:52,250
You do it yourself.

17468
10:24:52,450 --> 10:24:54,430
This is how cavemen learn.

17469
10:24:54,730 --> 10:24:55,370
Did you do it yourself?

17470
10:24:56,650 --> 10:24:57,630
I don't have pets.

17471
10:24:58,730 --> 10:25:00,750
You have cats.

17472
10:25:00,750 --> 10:25:03,030
No, I'm talking about in Minecraft.

17473
10:25:06,830 --> 10:25:08,150
What was I going to say?

17474
10:25:08,210 --> 10:25:09,850
You don't see your cat as a pet?

17475
10:25:10,410 --> 10:25:11,990
No, they're family.

17476
10:25:13,070 --> 10:25:15,270
That's why you don't neuter family, I guess.

17477
10:25:15,770 --> 10:25:17,070
Yeah, don't neuter your family.

17478
10:25:22,990 --> 10:25:25,170
Oops, I accidentally reloaded.

17479
10:25:26,090 --> 10:25:27,110
That's not what I meant to do.

17480
10:25:27,210 --> 10:25:28,330
I'm moving.

17481
10:25:29,170 --> 10:25:31,630
Guys, if I could find...

17482
10:25:31,630 --> 10:25:34,410
If I could find wild animals right now...

17483
10:25:34,410 --> 10:25:36,710
Wild chickens or lambs or whatever...

17484
10:25:36,710 --> 10:25:37,210
I would!

17485
10:25:37,470 --> 10:25:38,690
But I'm stuck here.

17486
10:25:38,830 --> 10:25:40,690
In this ice tundra.

17487
10:25:44,610 --> 10:25:45,870
We're so close.

17488
10:25:46,110 --> 10:25:46,970
We're so close.

17489
10:25:48,270 --> 10:25:51,210
I'm just rowing my boat until the end.

17490
10:25:51,990 --> 10:25:53,570
Just heading northeast.

17491
10:25:53,850 --> 10:25:56,230
Just heading northeast until...

17492
10:25:56,230 --> 10:25:57,550
Until it's over.

17493
10:25:57,550 --> 10:25:59,850
No, I used all the rhymes.

17494
10:26:00,110 --> 10:26:03,030
That's why my boat has to end.

17495
10:26:04,090 --> 10:26:04,350
Why?

17496
10:26:05,470 --> 10:26:06,190
What happened?

17497
10:26:06,850 --> 10:26:08,070
The water ended.

17498
10:26:08,330 --> 10:26:10,270
I don't know where you are or where I am.

17499
10:26:10,350 --> 10:26:11,350
I don't know anymore.

17500
10:26:11,510 --> 10:26:12,390
I'm just rowing.

17501
10:26:12,530 --> 10:26:15,290
I'm just rowing until we made it there.

17502
10:26:15,690 --> 10:26:17,270
I wonder if we're even close.

17503
10:26:18,010 --> 10:26:18,610
We're close.

17504
10:26:18,710 --> 10:26:20,330
We're getting there.

17505
10:26:20,470 --> 10:26:21,670
We're getting there.

17506
10:26:21,910 --> 10:26:23,530
We're almost there.

17507
10:26:23,530 --> 10:26:24,610
Then we'll have all our stuff.

17508
10:26:24,730 --> 10:26:26,750
Then we'll be able to continue the game.

17509
10:26:27,350 --> 10:26:29,210
Then we're basically at the end.

17510
10:26:29,290 --> 10:26:31,210
We're basically at the end at that point.

17511
10:26:31,410 --> 10:26:33,770
That's what happens.

17512
10:26:37,100 --> 10:26:38,840
Why did the connection reset?

17513
10:26:42,700 --> 10:26:44,400
What happened to our server?

17514
10:26:45,060 --> 10:26:45,860
What happened?

17515
10:26:46,540 --> 10:26:47,240
What happened?

17516
10:26:48,320 --> 10:26:49,440
Go back.

17517
10:26:49,700 --> 10:26:49,920
Go back.

17518
10:26:49,920 --> 10:26:51,580
Go back.

17519
10:26:55,620 --> 10:26:56,760
I'm back in the ice.

17520
10:26:56,920 --> 10:26:58,100
Where am I?

17521
10:26:59,760 --> 10:27:00,420
I'm back.

17522
10:27:01,020 --> 10:27:02,580
Before the ice.

17523
10:27:03,820 --> 10:27:05,120
Back in the ice?

17524
10:27:05,800 --> 10:27:07,400
I'm back in the ice.

17525
10:27:11,600 --> 10:27:15,740
How did I get back here?

17526
10:27:15,940 --> 10:27:17,780
How did I get back here?

17527
10:27:19,920 --> 10:27:20,960
Did you lose anything?

17528
10:27:21,760 --> 10:27:23,120
No, I didn't.

17529
10:27:23,740 --> 10:27:25,740
I have to row back.

17530
10:27:31,840 --> 10:27:33,340
I'm just running.

17531
10:27:33,640 --> 10:27:34,640
I don't care anymore.

17532
10:27:37,240 --> 10:27:41,900
I think I lost my dogs.

17533
10:27:47,670 --> 10:27:48,610
We have to run.

17534
10:27:49,450 --> 10:27:50,470
Where am I?

17535
10:27:50,690 --> 10:27:51,930
We have to just go.

17536
10:27:51,930 --> 10:27:53,410
Where am I?

17537
10:27:54,210 --> 10:27:56,070
We just have to go.

17538
10:27:56,250 --> 10:27:57,710
We just have to go.

17539
10:27:58,130 --> 10:28:05,680
Where did the dogs go?

17540
10:28:14,910 --> 10:28:17,150
It's fine, I can row again.

17541
10:28:17,630 --> 10:28:19,330
I can row again.

17542
10:28:19,810 --> 10:28:22,570
I actually lost the dogs.

17543
10:28:22,570 --> 10:28:23,730
I went the wrong way.

17544
10:28:23,990 --> 10:28:26,910
The dogs just disappeared.

17545
10:28:27,670 --> 10:28:29,130
Where did they go?

17546
10:28:29,530 --> 10:28:31,310
Where did the dogs go?

17547
10:28:33,030 --> 10:28:34,790
They're in a better place.

17548
10:28:35,090 --> 10:28:36,390
In Java Wonderland.

17549
10:28:37,730 --> 10:28:41,070
That's what happens when the Minecraft server...

17550
10:28:41,070 --> 10:28:42,710
Everybody goes to Java Wonderland.

17551
10:28:43,210 --> 10:28:44,090
I found a village.

17552
10:28:46,030 --> 10:28:50,790
I was in a delirious dream.

17553
10:28:50,790 --> 10:28:52,150
I was in a delirious dream because of...

17554
10:28:52,790 --> 10:28:54,470
frostbite or some shit.

17555
10:28:54,690 --> 10:28:57,430
I had frostbite.

17556
10:28:57,430 --> 10:28:58,770
You never had the dogs.

17557
10:29:00,570 --> 10:29:02,910
You were just pulling two rocks on a stick.

17558
10:29:04,570 --> 10:29:06,570
The frostbite got me.

17559
10:29:07,510 --> 10:29:10,350
The day restarted too though.

17560
10:29:10,770 --> 10:29:11,670
What happened?

17561
10:29:11,670 --> 10:29:13,370
Because we were about to hit night time.

17562
10:29:13,770 --> 10:29:16,730
What happened to the server?

17563
10:29:17,470 --> 10:29:18,190
What happened?

17564
10:29:18,770 --> 10:29:20,210
You need to get a refund.

17565
10:29:20,630 --> 10:29:23,130
The dogs were never real.

17566
10:29:24,190 --> 10:29:25,830
The dogs were never real.

17567
10:29:26,290 --> 10:29:29,010
I was going through some fucking shit.

17568
10:29:30,750 --> 10:29:33,070
But you saw them too.

17569
10:29:33,710 --> 10:29:35,790
You saw the dogs with me.

17570
10:29:36,010 --> 10:29:36,990
What are you talking about?

17571
10:29:37,010 --> 10:29:38,130
What do you mean?

17572
10:29:38,470 --> 10:29:40,770
You literally had two rocks on a stick.

17573
10:29:41,050 --> 10:29:41,730
Or on a string.

17574
10:29:42,170 --> 10:29:43,890
No, they were real.

17575
10:29:43,890 --> 10:29:46,430
You were encouraging the dogs.

17576
10:29:47,130 --> 10:29:50,570
You had always just two rocks on a string.

17577
10:29:50,670 --> 10:29:51,610
And you were like, my dogs.

17578
10:29:51,710 --> 10:29:52,790
I was like, just leave them.

17579
10:29:52,930 --> 10:29:53,690
They are rocks.

17580
10:30:00,490 --> 10:30:02,370
I don't want to go in there.

17581
10:30:03,010 --> 10:30:05,050
The dogs were never real.

17582
10:30:05,630 --> 10:30:07,050
The dogs were never real.

17583
10:30:07,570 --> 10:30:08,670
I don't want to go in there.

17584
10:30:08,750 --> 10:30:09,770
I might die in here.

17585
10:30:15,690 --> 10:30:17,310
They were never real.

17586
10:30:18,970 --> 10:30:19,950
They were never real.

17587
10:30:21,810 --> 10:30:22,550
They were never real.

17588
10:30:22,550 --> 10:30:23,510
They were just in my head.

17589
10:30:24,270 --> 10:30:25,190
Just a dream.

17590
10:30:25,350 --> 10:30:29,650
Just like this fever dream that we are experiencing right now.

17591
10:30:31,640 --> 10:30:32,710
They were never real.

17592
10:30:33,190 --> 10:30:34,310
When does it end?

17593
10:30:34,450 --> 10:30:37,950
When does the minecraft end?

17594
10:30:37,950 --> 10:30:39,170
It's gonna end.

17595
10:30:39,170 --> 10:30:40,970
I don't want to play minecraft anymore.

17596
10:30:40,970 --> 10:30:42,630
It's gonna end.

17597
10:30:42,810 --> 10:30:44,870
Just keep on moving.

17598
10:30:45,170 --> 10:30:46,630
Just keep on moving.

17599
10:30:46,990 --> 10:30:48,170
The moment...

17600
10:30:48,170 --> 10:30:50,670
The moment we get to that area.

17601
10:30:51,410 --> 10:30:52,390
We are done.

17602
10:30:52,510 --> 10:30:54,210
We are almost to the end at that point.

17603
10:30:54,430 --> 10:30:55,950
We are literally like...

17604
10:30:55,950 --> 10:30:59,630
All our stuff to make it to the end is in that chest.

17605
10:31:00,390 --> 10:31:02,450
We have to kill the dragon.

17606
10:31:03,150 --> 10:31:05,110
We have everything we need.

17607
10:31:05,210 --> 10:31:06,550
We just need the phantom thing.

17608
10:31:06,890 --> 10:31:07,870
And then the redstone.

17609
10:31:07,870 --> 10:31:10,710
When we get there, we're gonna get to the redstone.

17610
10:31:10,850 --> 10:31:12,090
And then I'll farm the phantom.

17611
10:31:12,270 --> 10:31:13,230
You go get redstone.

17612
10:31:13,330 --> 10:31:14,190
I farm phantom.

17613
10:31:14,630 --> 10:31:15,990
And then it's all over.

17614
10:31:16,250 --> 10:31:18,130
And we're free.

17615
10:31:18,590 --> 10:31:19,950
And we'll be free.

17616
10:31:20,790 --> 10:31:22,130
There's zombies in here.

17617
10:31:22,910 --> 10:31:24,270
I'm in the scary woods.

17618
10:31:24,690 --> 10:31:26,310
I'm still in the snow.

17619
10:31:26,970 --> 10:31:28,490
Where the hell are you?

17620
10:31:28,730 --> 10:31:31,050
I'm still in the snow.

17621
10:31:32,270 --> 10:31:33,850
How are you still in the snow?

17622
10:31:33,850 --> 10:31:35,130
I don't know anymore.

17623
10:31:35,130 --> 10:31:36,230
I'm still there.

17624
10:31:39,230 --> 10:31:40,210
Oh my god.

17625
10:31:41,290 --> 10:31:41,790
Woah!

17626
10:31:42,090 --> 10:31:43,170
Lush biome.

17627
10:31:43,590 --> 10:31:43,970
Anyway.

17628
10:31:46,310 --> 10:31:47,390
And I got dirt.

17629
10:31:47,490 --> 10:31:48,130
I got dirt.

17630
10:31:50,250 --> 10:31:51,770
Uh oh, it's starting to get dark.

17631
10:31:52,930 --> 10:31:55,470
Oh man, why did they go by so fast?

17632
10:31:55,570 --> 10:31:56,910
Server, you were supposed to break!

17633
10:31:56,950 --> 10:31:57,490
What happened?

17634
10:32:00,550 --> 10:32:02,930
I feel like I've been running for years.

17635
10:32:02,930 --> 10:32:04,210
She took my dog.

17636
10:32:05,230 --> 10:32:06,410
I've been running for years.

17637
10:32:06,550 --> 10:32:08,310
And running and running and running for years.

17638
10:32:09,130 --> 10:32:10,510
Oh my god, there's another dog.

17639
10:32:11,350 --> 10:32:12,270
Get over here.

17640
10:32:13,010 --> 10:32:14,010
I knew you were real.

17641
10:32:14,550 --> 10:32:15,910
I knew you were real.

17642
10:32:16,070 --> 10:32:16,830
I got dogs!

17643
10:32:24,430 --> 10:32:25,570
I got the dogs.

17644
10:32:27,170 --> 10:32:28,050
I'm in the trees.

17645
10:32:28,230 --> 10:32:29,850
I'm a fucking monkey right now.

17646
10:32:32,370 --> 10:32:34,010
How do I get down from here?

17647
10:32:34,010 --> 10:32:35,390
Oh god, how do I get down from here?

17648
10:32:38,330 --> 10:32:39,610
I'm camping in the trees tonight.

17649
10:32:39,610 --> 10:32:42,510
Oh no, I can't see anything.

17650
10:32:43,030 --> 10:32:44,590
I'm camping in the trees tonight.

17651
10:32:46,070 --> 10:32:48,050
I can't see anything.

17652
10:32:48,570 --> 10:32:51,790
I can't see anything anymore.

17653
10:32:51,990 --> 10:32:53,630
Everything is so dark.

17654
10:32:55,930 --> 10:32:57,330
Use your torches.

17655
10:32:58,350 --> 10:32:59,910
I can't see anything.

17656
10:33:00,910 --> 10:33:01,570
Are you dead?

17657
10:33:01,910 --> 10:33:03,050
No, I just...

17658
10:33:03,050 --> 10:33:04,430
It's so dark.

17659
10:33:04,430 --> 10:33:06,290
It's so dark and cold.

17660
10:33:08,230 --> 10:33:09,270
What's your coordinates?

17661
10:33:09,730 --> 10:33:11,010
I'm just curious.

17662
10:33:11,370 --> 10:33:14,550
Give me a second, I need to go up this snowy mountain.

17663
10:33:14,590 --> 10:33:16,310
How did I make no progress?

17664
10:33:16,610 --> 10:33:17,890
How did I make no progress?

17665
10:33:18,170 --> 10:33:19,930
I had 4000 left.

17666
10:33:20,170 --> 10:33:22,650
And now I'm at 4000 still.

17667
10:33:23,290 --> 10:33:23,670
How?

17668
10:33:24,230 --> 10:33:25,530
I don't know anymore.

17669
10:33:25,890 --> 10:33:28,090
I don't know anymore.

17670
10:33:28,790 --> 10:33:30,290
I don't know.

17671
10:33:30,470 --> 10:33:31,550
I don't know.

17672
10:33:31,550 --> 10:33:32,130
Oh no, I'm out.

17673
10:33:32,230 --> 10:33:34,130
I'm out of the fucking...

17674
10:33:34,130 --> 10:33:37,070
Oh my god, I'm finally out.

17675
10:33:37,650 --> 10:33:41,130
I'm finally out of this godforsaken night.

17676
10:33:42,210 --> 10:33:44,710
I'm just gonna sleep through this night, okay?

17677
10:33:44,850 --> 10:33:47,550
No, you cannot sleep through the night because...

17678
10:33:48,210 --> 10:33:52,490
No, no, no, no.

17679
10:33:54,190 --> 10:33:55,110
No, no, no.

17680
10:33:55,250 --> 10:33:56,010
I'm trapped.

17681
10:33:57,630 --> 10:33:59,490
I'm trapped in the trees.

17682
10:33:59,490 --> 10:34:00,830
I can't see.

17683
10:34:01,570 --> 10:34:02,830
Where's my torch?

17684
10:34:03,550 --> 10:34:03,990
Okay.

17685
10:34:05,290 --> 10:34:05,910
Alright.

17686
10:34:09,870 --> 10:34:11,070
Okay, it's this way.

17687
10:34:11,770 --> 10:34:12,590
It's this way, alright.

17688
10:34:13,330 --> 10:34:15,290
Alright, I can't see much.

17689
10:34:15,830 --> 10:34:17,790
But I know I'm going the right way.

17690
10:34:19,510 --> 10:34:21,870
I know I'm going...

17691
10:34:21,870 --> 10:34:23,910
I'm at 7,833.

17692
10:34:26,050 --> 10:34:27,370
4,060.

17693
10:34:27,370 --> 10:34:28,050
4,060.

17694
10:34:28,890 --> 10:34:30,610
Oh, okay, you're further than me.

17695
10:34:30,850 --> 10:34:31,630
Wait, where are you?

17696
10:34:33,770 --> 10:34:34,730
7,995.

17697
10:34:34,910 --> 10:34:36,510
4,281.

17698
10:34:36,690 --> 10:34:38,530
Okay, your Z is further though.

17699
10:34:40,850 --> 10:34:42,490
Yeah, you have more Zs.

17700
10:34:42,910 --> 10:34:44,630
I'm at...

17701
10:34:44,630 --> 10:34:48,990
Oh my god, the night is lighting the pathway for me so I can't see shit.

17702
10:34:52,730 --> 10:34:54,930
Phantom, please.

17703
10:34:55,570 --> 10:34:58,110
Phantom, where the fuck are the...

17704
10:34:58,690 --> 10:35:00,710
I'm like trapped in the trees, you guys.

17705
10:35:00,770 --> 10:35:01,970
I don't know how to get down.

17706
10:35:04,250 --> 10:35:06,870
I don't want to be in the trees anymore.

17707
10:35:07,090 --> 10:35:08,130
I don't want to be a tree person.

17708
10:35:09,730 --> 10:35:11,210
Oh my god, that cow scared me.

17709
10:35:12,090 --> 10:35:14,370
I don't want to be in the trees.

17710
10:35:14,490 --> 10:35:15,510
I can't see anything.

17711
10:35:15,650 --> 10:35:16,610
It's so dark.

17712
10:35:17,070 --> 10:35:18,910
The things I do for a phantom.

17713
10:35:20,550 --> 10:35:21,290
I know, right?

17714
10:35:21,430 --> 10:35:22,210
Should we just sleep?

17715
10:35:22,210 --> 10:35:23,030
Should we just sleep?

17716
10:35:23,390 --> 10:35:25,850
No, we're committed.

17717
10:35:26,470 --> 10:35:27,010
We gotta...

17718
10:35:27,010 --> 10:35:29,110
Oh my god, there's skellies in the trees.

17719
10:35:30,730 --> 10:35:32,870
How do we get around, you guys?

17720
10:35:33,970 --> 10:35:35,610
Burn it, burn it down.

17721
10:35:35,870 --> 10:35:37,230
I might die too.

17722
10:35:38,810 --> 10:35:40,550
Just burn everything down.

17723
10:35:41,350 --> 10:35:41,870
Phantom!

17724
10:35:42,730 --> 10:35:43,250
I have a phantom!

17725
10:35:43,430 --> 10:35:43,790
Nice!

17726
10:35:44,010 --> 10:35:45,730
Everything is going well!

17727
10:35:46,030 --> 10:35:46,750
I have two of them!

17728
10:35:47,090 --> 10:35:50,070
I hit them, I think.

17729
10:35:53,330 --> 10:35:54,270
Where are you?

17730
10:35:55,890 --> 10:35:57,590
There's a dog, there's a dog.

17731
10:35:57,970 --> 10:35:58,670
Get over here.

17732
10:35:58,990 --> 10:36:01,130
I hit him, I hit him.

17733
10:36:02,510 --> 10:36:03,830
Come on, phantom!

17734
10:36:04,650 --> 10:36:05,210
Come here.

17735
10:36:05,730 --> 10:36:07,550
Alright, my dog died.

17736
10:36:09,270 --> 10:36:10,070
That's fine.

17737
10:36:11,110 --> 10:36:13,190
Oh my god, there's creepers and zombies coming after me.

17738
10:36:13,350 --> 10:36:14,430
Oh my god, there's a zombie coming.

17739
10:36:14,790 --> 10:36:16,530
What can I do?

17740
10:36:18,630 --> 10:36:19,150
Membrane!

17741
10:36:19,430 --> 10:36:21,090
We got two membranes!

17742
10:36:21,090 --> 10:36:22,590
How many membranes do we need?

17743
10:36:22,650 --> 10:36:23,690
How many membranes do we need?

17744
10:36:24,010 --> 10:36:25,310
A lot, I think.

17745
10:36:25,530 --> 10:36:26,230
How much is a lot?

17746
10:36:30,240 --> 10:36:33,000
Chat, how many membranes do we need?

17747
10:36:36,100 --> 10:36:37,160
I got another one!

17748
10:36:37,260 --> 10:36:37,740
I got two membranes!

17749
10:36:37,740 --> 10:36:38,660
Nice, nice, nice!

17750
10:36:39,640 --> 10:36:40,080
Four.

17751
10:36:41,340 --> 10:36:42,680
Wait, four per potion?

17752
10:36:46,100 --> 10:36:48,200
One membrane equals three potions.

17753
10:36:48,520 --> 10:36:48,880
Oh, okay.

17754
10:36:49,820 --> 10:36:50,660
Then we're good.

17755
10:36:50,660 --> 10:36:51,240
Yeah, we're good.

17756
10:36:51,320 --> 10:36:53,020
We already got what we needed and we're fine.

17757
10:36:53,480 --> 10:36:56,320
Oh no, I think we can get a little few more, right?

17758
10:36:56,380 --> 10:36:58,520
Because I have one as well, so we...

17759
10:36:58,520 --> 10:37:00,440
Yeah, but I think we can manage...

17760
10:37:00,440 --> 10:37:01,940
I think we can, you know...

17761
10:37:01,940 --> 10:37:03,200
Oh gosh, there's creepers everywhere.

17762
10:37:03,440 --> 10:37:04,400
Please leave me alone.

17763
10:37:05,380 --> 10:37:06,880
I'm stuck in the trees, Donkey!

17764
10:37:07,160 --> 10:37:07,940
I'm stuck in the trees!

17765
10:37:08,580 --> 10:37:11,540
I need to make my bread, but there's too many monsters.

17766
10:37:12,060 --> 10:37:13,860
I'm stuck in the trees!

17767
10:37:15,440 --> 10:37:16,880
Oh my god!

17768
10:37:17,300 --> 10:37:18,520
Oh my god, I'm...

17769
10:37:18,520 --> 10:37:19,420
What's your coordinates?

17770
10:37:19,560 --> 10:37:20,280
Where are we at?

17771
10:37:21,160 --> 10:37:22,500
I haven't moved!

17772
10:37:22,740 --> 10:37:23,540
I'm stuck in the trees!

17773
10:37:23,840 --> 10:37:25,120
You are stuck in the trees.

17774
10:37:25,240 --> 10:37:26,840
I didn't know when you said you were stuck in the trees.

17775
10:37:27,120 --> 10:37:29,440
I didn't realize you were stuck, stuck in the trees.

17776
10:37:29,560 --> 10:37:31,220
I'm stuck, stuck in the trees!

17777
10:37:32,320 --> 10:37:32,720
Alright.

17778
10:37:33,400 --> 10:37:34,700
This is so stupid.

17779
10:37:39,320 --> 10:37:41,240
We have feathers, we have chicken.

17780
10:37:41,580 --> 10:37:41,840
Nice.

17781
10:37:43,160 --> 10:37:43,920
Alright, guys.

17782
10:37:46,000 --> 10:37:46,680
I'm gonna keep running.

17783
10:37:48,640 --> 10:37:50,060
I'm gonna keep running, too.

17784
10:37:50,280 --> 10:37:51,960
I'm gonna keep running.

17785
10:37:51,980 --> 10:37:52,460
Run!

17786
10:37:54,300 --> 10:37:54,860
I'm at...

17787
10:37:54,860 --> 10:37:56,520
I'm almost done.

17788
10:37:56,660 --> 10:38:02,320
I'm at 47,493,4200.

17789
10:38:02,860 --> 10:38:08,800
We're at 3,000 C's away and 3,000 X's away!

17790
10:38:09,220 --> 10:38:09,500
Okay!

17791
10:38:12,220 --> 10:38:13,300
Oh my god, it's so close.

17792
10:38:13,320 --> 10:38:15,180
We're running, running, running, running.

17793
10:38:15,180 --> 10:38:16,760
We're so close.

17794
10:38:16,880 --> 10:38:18,100
We're so close.

17795
10:38:20,040 --> 10:38:21,020
Oh, that was a sheep.

17796
10:38:21,780 --> 10:38:22,700
Don't scare me, sheep.

17797
10:38:23,260 --> 10:38:24,280
I almost tried to kill you.

17798
10:38:25,440 --> 10:38:25,680
Okay.

17799
10:38:27,600 --> 10:38:29,700
Can I just get some water, please?

17800
10:38:30,020 --> 10:38:31,120
Like, that I can...

17801
10:38:31,120 --> 10:38:33,000
Oh my god, this is a bad area.

17802
10:38:33,360 --> 10:38:35,080
When it's daytime, I can fucking...

17803
10:38:35,080 --> 10:38:36,100
I'll be able to...

17804
10:38:36,100 --> 10:38:38,160
I'll be able to make more...

17805
10:38:38,160 --> 10:38:40,000
Make more bread.

17806
10:38:40,860 --> 10:38:42,380
I just need it to be daytime.

17807
10:38:42,380 --> 10:38:44,380
We can sleep, probably.

17808
10:38:44,680 --> 10:38:45,760
Oh wait, the day is breaking.

17809
10:38:45,920 --> 10:38:46,640
The dawn is breaking.

17810
10:38:46,820 --> 10:38:47,800
Oh no, that's a village.

17811
10:38:48,760 --> 10:38:49,360
That's good, that's good.

17812
10:38:49,440 --> 10:38:50,080
Find some books.

17813
10:38:50,220 --> 10:38:50,920
Find some books.

17814
10:38:51,760 --> 10:38:52,980
They're on the other side.

17815
10:38:53,060 --> 10:38:53,880
I can't reach them.

17816
10:38:54,240 --> 10:38:56,380
Oh no, it's falling apart.

17817
10:38:56,600 --> 10:38:57,880
Just find a way.

17818
10:38:58,740 --> 10:38:59,280
Oh my god.

17819
10:38:59,460 --> 10:39:00,500
Okay, I'll try.

17820
10:39:00,800 --> 10:39:01,580
Oh god.

17821
10:39:02,180 --> 10:39:03,260
I'm just heading over.

17822
10:39:03,940 --> 10:39:05,960
Guys, what was the coordinates again?

17823
10:39:06,040 --> 10:39:06,740
What were the coordinates?

17824
10:39:08,400 --> 10:39:09,340
I don't think I can make it.

17825
10:39:09,800 --> 10:39:10,900
Phantom swoops again!

17826
10:39:12,020 --> 10:39:13,000
That's good, that's good.

17827
10:39:13,340 --> 10:39:14,180
Where is he?

17828
10:39:15,720 --> 10:39:16,320
Where is he?

17829
10:39:18,520 --> 10:39:19,120
Hello, Phantom?

17830
10:39:20,480 --> 10:39:21,180
Phantom, where are you?

17831
10:39:21,180 --> 10:39:21,640
Oh, there he is.

17832
10:39:21,660 --> 10:39:22,400
He's stuck in the trees.

17833
10:39:23,900 --> 10:39:24,680
Idiot, Phantom.

17834
10:39:24,880 --> 10:39:26,000
Wait, I think...

17835
10:39:29,060 --> 10:39:30,140
Hold on, guys.

17836
10:39:30,400 --> 10:39:30,740
Hold on.

17837
10:39:32,300 --> 10:39:33,260
Phantom, where did he go?

17838
10:39:36,540 --> 10:39:37,260
What happened?

17839
10:39:37,260 --> 10:39:38,060
He bit me?

17840
10:39:38,960 --> 10:39:40,640
I don't know if you're gonna turn into one of them.

17841
10:39:40,760 --> 10:39:42,740
I am a phantom already.

17842
10:39:44,840 --> 10:39:46,100
I need to punch this.

17843
10:39:47,940 --> 10:39:51,020
The thing is spawning around me, but I need to kill him before...

17844
10:39:51,020 --> 10:39:51,440
Daybreak!

17845
10:39:52,400 --> 10:39:53,740
Oh no, daybreak is coming!

17846
10:39:54,780 --> 10:39:55,900
I need to kill him!

17847
10:39:56,260 --> 10:39:57,260
Thank god.

17848
10:39:59,160 --> 10:40:01,280
Don't hide there, you stupid idiot!

17849
10:40:02,120 --> 10:40:03,040
What do I not need?

17850
10:40:03,140 --> 10:40:05,060
I have so many... Oh my god, we don't need this.

17851
10:40:05,840 --> 10:40:06,700
Come on, come on.

17852
10:40:06,700 --> 10:40:08,160
Where is the wood I was punching?

17853
10:40:08,380 --> 10:40:10,180
Where is the wood?!

17854
10:40:10,700 --> 10:40:11,740
I almost had him.

17855
10:40:12,820 --> 10:40:14,300
Come on, come on, come on.

17856
10:40:15,040 --> 10:40:15,700
I can kill him!

17857
10:40:15,840 --> 10:40:18,120
You were fighting the phantoms on the cliff?

17858
10:40:19,000 --> 10:40:20,780
Yeah, I'm like...

17859
10:40:21,400 --> 10:40:22,280
I'm like...

17860
10:40:22,280 --> 10:40:25,260
In my own epic story time over here, okay?

17861
10:40:26,000 --> 10:40:27,640
Oh, he didn't give me one though.

17862
10:40:27,700 --> 10:40:28,700
He didn't give me a membrane.

17863
10:40:31,840 --> 10:40:32,280
Okay.

17864
10:40:32,280 --> 10:40:34,000
I can't, I can't move from here.

17865
10:40:34,100 --> 10:40:36,580
You told me to go to the village, I'm trying to get there!

17866
10:40:36,920 --> 10:40:39,180
I told you it was on the other side!

17867
10:40:40,080 --> 10:40:42,020
And you said go anyway!

17868
10:40:42,260 --> 10:40:43,160
I'm just going.

17869
10:40:43,360 --> 10:40:44,760
You said make it!

17870
10:40:45,880 --> 10:40:47,680
It's for your own good.

17871
10:40:48,240 --> 10:40:50,240
It's for your own good.

17872
10:40:50,880 --> 10:40:54,160
I can't see anything in night time.

17873
10:40:55,100 --> 10:40:55,760
Oh my god, please.

17874
10:40:56,080 --> 10:40:56,760
Get on there, okay.

17875
10:40:58,600 --> 10:41:01,100
Okay, I'm trying to get to the other side.

17876
10:41:01,100 --> 10:41:01,960
Okay.

17877
10:41:02,660 --> 10:41:04,800
Guys, oh, I don't think this is possible.

17878
10:41:06,300 --> 10:41:07,440
Sorry, just keep going.

17879
10:41:07,760 --> 10:41:09,020
Just keep going, just keep going.

17880
10:41:10,340 --> 10:41:11,500
I'm sorry village!

17881
10:41:12,220 --> 10:41:13,840
We'll raid you another time!

17882
10:41:14,640 --> 10:41:17,320
Yeah, I know there's a drowned you guys aside, I saw it.

17883
10:41:18,380 --> 10:41:18,880
I don't...

17884
10:41:18,880 --> 10:41:25,460
Hopefully he doesn't have a trident, or else I'm really...

17885
10:41:25,460 --> 10:41:26,980
Or else I'm doomed.

17886
10:41:27,560 --> 10:41:30,240
Oh my god, two thousand left for the X.

17887
10:41:30,240 --> 10:41:33,000
And two thousand left for three.

17888
10:41:33,180 --> 10:41:36,960
I can't believe we came from twelve thousand and ten thousand.

17889
10:41:37,080 --> 10:41:38,940
I can't...

17890
10:41:38,940 --> 10:41:41,940
I can't believe it.

17891
10:41:42,340 --> 10:41:44,060
I'm pretty far still though.

17892
10:41:44,180 --> 10:41:45,280
I didn't make much progress.

17893
10:41:45,300 --> 10:41:48,140
I'm at negative six thousand eight hundred.

17894
10:41:48,600 --> 10:41:50,590
We're at three thousand seven hundred.

17895
10:41:51,060 --> 10:41:52,080
Where are you?

17896
10:41:52,440 --> 10:41:54,920
Okay, I'm negative seven thousand five hundred.

17897
10:41:55,100 --> 10:41:56,620
Four thousand two hundred.

17898
10:41:58,340 --> 10:41:59,860
What do they mean?

17899
10:41:59,940 --> 10:42:01,640
What do the numbers mean?

17900
10:42:01,660 --> 10:42:03,480
I can't do this anymore.

17901
10:42:03,820 --> 10:42:05,280
We're so close!

17902
10:42:05,560 --> 10:42:08,100
We can't just stop at that moment!

17903
10:42:08,320 --> 10:42:09,860
We're so close!

17904
10:42:12,340 --> 10:42:14,220
Mint, yes you are!

17905
10:42:15,000 --> 10:42:17,520
Mint, I will drag you to the finish line!

17906
10:42:17,940 --> 10:42:20,100
Mint, I will drag you!

17907
10:42:20,360 --> 10:42:21,340
We're so close!

17908
10:42:21,500 --> 10:42:24,880
Mint, we're gonna do this!

17909
10:42:24,880 --> 10:42:26,200
We're gonna make it!

17910
10:42:26,320 --> 10:42:27,960
We'll have everything we need!

17911
10:42:28,100 --> 10:42:31,500
By the time we make it back, we'll have everything we need!

17912
10:42:31,780 --> 10:42:32,320
Mint,

17913
10:42:35,340 --> 10:42:37,640
you knew what we committed to!

17914
10:42:38,040 --> 10:42:38,740
You knew!

17915
10:42:39,120 --> 10:42:41,480
You knew the risk!

17916
10:42:41,860 --> 10:42:42,320
You knew!

17917
10:42:43,240 --> 10:42:45,000
You knew the risk!

17918
10:42:45,300 --> 10:42:48,020
You could have suggested an earlier time!

17919
10:42:48,380 --> 10:42:50,020
I gave you a chance!

17920
10:42:50,060 --> 10:42:51,140
But you suggested so late!

17921
10:42:51,140 --> 10:42:52,340
I forgot!

17922
10:42:52,640 --> 10:42:54,840
I forgot how late it was!

17923
10:42:54,940 --> 10:42:55,480
I forgot!

17924
10:42:55,740 --> 10:42:57,420
I forgot!

17925
10:42:57,940 --> 10:42:59,680
You could have asked for an earlier time!

17926
10:43:00,100 --> 10:43:01,820
You knew how long it was gonna take in the end!

17927
10:43:02,160 --> 10:43:05,020
You knew this was the sacrifice we're gonna have to make!

17928
10:43:05,380 --> 10:43:06,960
We're almost there!

17929
10:43:07,320 --> 10:43:09,440
We're almost there!

17930
10:43:09,580 --> 10:43:10,800
I'm at the sad file!

17931
10:43:11,160 --> 10:43:12,580
Remember the sad file!

17932
10:43:13,040 --> 10:43:15,100
Do you remember the sad file?

17933
10:43:18,260 --> 10:43:19,840
We can do this!

17934
10:43:20,000 --> 10:43:21,300
I believe in...

17935
10:43:21,300 --> 10:43:24,880
I'm almost there!

17936
10:43:25,160 --> 10:43:27,000
I'm almost there at the original!

17937
10:43:27,440 --> 10:43:28,520
And then when we meet up...

17938
10:43:28,520 --> 10:43:29,720
This isn't even the goal!

17939
10:43:30,620 --> 10:43:34,340
And we meet up, but we'll have everything we need!

17940
10:43:34,740 --> 10:43:37,980
We'll literally have everything we need!

17941
10:43:38,300 --> 10:43:39,700
When we get there!

17942
10:43:40,800 --> 10:43:42,560
That hurts so much!

17943
10:43:42,560 --> 10:43:43,820
I found the Mesa!

17944
10:43:44,000 --> 10:43:45,440
I found the Mesa!

17945
10:43:45,600 --> 10:43:46,740
The original Mesa!

17946
10:43:47,840 --> 10:43:49,620
We're actually almost there!

17947
10:43:49,960 --> 10:43:53,480
I remembered this area!

17948
10:43:54,860 --> 10:43:56,500
We're actually almost there!

17949
10:43:58,980 --> 10:44:00,940
Redstone is in the mineshaft, right?

17950
10:44:02,420 --> 10:44:03,640
Okay, it's time.

17951
10:44:03,740 --> 10:44:04,440
I'm going in.

17952
10:44:04,560 --> 10:44:06,400
I'm going into the Mesa mineshaft.

17953
10:44:06,400 --> 10:44:08,540
I have the warts, I have another warts.

17954
10:44:09,860 --> 10:44:12,300
Okay, I'm going into the Mesa mineshaft.

17955
10:44:12,800 --> 10:44:15,100
Do stuff while I'm, you know...

17956
10:44:15,100 --> 10:44:16,280
While you're traveling?

17957
10:44:16,680 --> 10:44:17,020
Yeah.

17958
10:44:18,200 --> 10:44:24,120
Oh my god, how many redstone?

17959
10:44:24,240 --> 10:44:24,920
I got redstone!

17960
10:44:25,180 --> 10:44:26,000
How many do we need?

17961
10:44:27,980 --> 10:44:29,580
Oh wait, is it redstone?

17962
10:44:29,700 --> 10:44:32,560
What's the one that makes the potions longer, you guys?

17963
10:44:36,400 --> 10:44:37,280
Oh my god.

17964
10:44:37,800 --> 10:44:39,860
Is it the glowstone or is it the redstone?

17965
10:44:40,040 --> 10:44:42,340
Wait, is it redstone or glowstone?

17966
10:44:42,520 --> 10:44:44,420
No, don't say that.

17967
10:44:48,540 --> 10:44:49,020
Redstone?

17968
10:44:49,280 --> 10:44:49,520
Okay.

17969
10:44:50,120 --> 10:44:51,360
Okay, I have a lot of...

17970
10:44:51,360 --> 10:44:52,580
What does the glowstone do?

17971
10:44:52,800 --> 10:44:54,240
The glowstone does something else.

17972
10:44:58,960 --> 10:45:00,460
Okay, I have...

17973
10:45:00,460 --> 10:45:01,540
I have eight.

17974
10:45:04,580 --> 10:45:05,920
Eight is enough.

17975
10:45:05,920 --> 10:45:06,980
Okay, I'm leaving.

17976
10:45:07,340 --> 10:45:08,960
I'm fucking leaving then.

17977
10:45:09,060 --> 10:45:09,840
We have...

17978
10:45:09,840 --> 10:45:10,540
Oh, more power.

17979
10:45:10,820 --> 10:45:11,300
Okay, okay.

17980
10:45:11,860 --> 10:45:13,840
Yeah, glowstone is for strength and then...

17981
10:45:13,840 --> 10:45:16,060
Redstone makes it last longer, the potions.

17982
10:45:16,720 --> 10:45:17,000
Okay.

17983
10:45:17,660 --> 10:45:19,520
I got... I got eight.

17984
10:45:19,600 --> 10:45:20,120
Eight is enough.

17985
10:45:20,220 --> 10:45:21,620
People are saying eight is enough.

17986
10:45:21,980 --> 10:45:23,500
That's good enough for me.

17987
10:45:24,080 --> 10:45:24,360
Okay.

17988
10:45:25,820 --> 10:45:27,960
I just passed by some jungles.

17989
10:45:31,880 --> 10:45:32,440
Okay.

17990
10:45:32,440 --> 10:45:32,540
Okay.

17991
10:45:34,820 --> 10:45:36,040
I'm almost there.

17992
10:45:36,300 --> 10:45:37,780
I'm actually almost there.

17993
10:45:38,880 --> 10:45:40,220
I'm in the mesa too.

17994
10:45:40,480 --> 10:45:41,200
We're in the mesa?

17995
10:45:41,420 --> 10:45:42,400
Oh, that's good!

17996
10:45:43,220 --> 10:45:43,580
Oh my god.

17997
10:45:43,620 --> 10:45:45,000
I gotta make the bread.

17998
10:45:45,380 --> 10:45:46,820
I almost forgot to make the bread.

17999
10:45:48,560 --> 10:45:49,080
Hey.

18000
10:45:50,180 --> 10:45:50,640
Bread.

18001
10:45:51,820 --> 10:45:52,600
I think that's mesa.

18002
10:45:53,280 --> 10:45:54,000
Isn't that?

18003
10:45:56,080 --> 10:45:57,100
I'm in the desert.

18004
10:45:58,120 --> 10:46:00,040
How come I can't make bread?

18005
10:46:01,100 --> 10:46:01,880
What do you mean?

18006
10:46:02,040 --> 10:46:03,880
Why you not let me make bread?

18007
10:46:04,240 --> 10:46:07,340
Turn the hay bales into actual hay.

18008
10:46:07,780 --> 10:46:08,080
Okay.

18009
10:46:08,380 --> 10:46:09,460
I made bread.

18010
10:46:10,100 --> 10:46:11,540
I didn't make bread.

18011
10:46:12,200 --> 10:46:13,260
I made bread.

18012
10:46:13,860 --> 10:46:15,720
Okay, I need to figure out my inventory.

18013
10:46:15,860 --> 10:46:18,460
My inventory is a mess and I'm trying to figure this out.

18014
10:46:18,640 --> 10:46:20,060
I'm gonna eat my last...

18015
10:46:20,060 --> 10:46:21,640
I'm gonna eat my last carrot.

18016
10:46:23,120 --> 10:46:24,660
I'm gonna start eating bread.

18017
10:46:24,780 --> 10:46:26,020
I'm gonna start eating bread.

18018
10:46:26,060 --> 10:46:27,540
Oh my god, get your carbs in.

18019
10:46:27,540 --> 10:46:28,960
I'm getting my carbs in.

18020
10:46:29,160 --> 10:46:31,320
And then I'm gonna throw this away.

18021
10:46:35,920 --> 10:46:37,080
And then...

18022
10:46:38,220 --> 10:46:38,800
Okay.

18023
10:46:39,960 --> 10:46:40,760
I'm heading over.

18024
10:46:40,960 --> 10:46:41,900
I'm heading...

18025
10:46:43,420 --> 10:46:45,040
2954 for the Z.

18026
10:46:45,380 --> 10:46:47,060
And then negative 6000.

18027
10:46:47,580 --> 10:46:49,770
Wait, I'm walking the wrong way for X.

18028
10:46:50,800 --> 10:46:51,600
That's not good.

18029
10:46:51,940 --> 10:46:53,540
Alright, and then...

18030
10:46:54,440 --> 10:46:56,120
We're like probably so close to each other.

18031
10:46:56,120 --> 10:46:56,800
It probably is.

18032
10:46:56,900 --> 10:46:58,640
I found the original temple.

18033
10:46:59,560 --> 10:47:00,460
Oh shit.

18034
10:47:01,160 --> 10:47:04,100
Oh my god, we've been playing that same map for...

18035
10:47:04,100 --> 10:47:06,040
The temple just exploded.

18036
10:47:06,260 --> 10:47:06,900
Like, how?

18037
10:47:07,740 --> 10:47:07,840
What?

18038
10:47:10,660 --> 10:47:11,460
Wait, what?

18039
10:47:11,720 --> 10:47:14,720
The temple exploded next to me.

18040
10:47:16,220 --> 10:47:18,220
I wonder if something spawned in it.

18041
10:47:18,340 --> 10:47:19,640
And then it pressed the button.

18042
10:47:20,460 --> 10:47:23,020
Or the chunks loaded in.

18043
10:47:23,020 --> 10:47:24,980
And then it exploded.

18044
10:47:27,500 --> 10:47:29,180
Holy shit, that was freaky.

18045
10:47:29,300 --> 10:47:30,460
That was actually freaky.

18046
10:47:31,540 --> 10:47:32,380
Wait, are there bookshelves?

18047
10:47:34,180 --> 10:47:36,700
Oh my god, how did that happen?

18048
10:47:38,100 --> 10:47:39,100
Is that a peepee tower?

18049
10:47:39,280 --> 10:47:39,920
No, just kidding.

18050
10:47:40,220 --> 10:47:41,720
I didn't make any peepee towers here.

18051
10:47:41,760 --> 10:47:43,300
I made a peepee tower near the city.

18052
10:47:43,520 --> 10:47:45,440
That's the first village we went to.

18053
10:47:46,040 --> 10:47:47,500
Okay, nevermind.

18054
10:47:47,580 --> 10:47:48,360
I have to get around this.

18055
10:47:49,460 --> 10:47:51,020
I'll go this way.

18056
10:47:51,020 --> 10:47:51,840
I'll go this way.

18057
10:47:55,080 --> 10:47:55,560
Armadillo!

18058
10:47:55,860 --> 10:47:56,340
So cute!

18059
10:47:56,360 --> 10:47:57,220
I see the armadillos.

18060
10:47:57,560 --> 10:47:59,340
Man, I wish I had my three dogs.

18061
10:48:00,860 --> 10:48:02,680
Oh, could've used that, yeah.

18062
10:48:02,840 --> 10:48:03,620
What happened to them?

18063
10:48:03,960 --> 10:48:04,720
I don't know.

18064
10:48:05,340 --> 10:48:07,420
I guess I just didn't take my meds.

18065
10:48:07,860 --> 10:48:09,100
I guess that's it.

18066
10:48:09,580 --> 10:48:10,900
Oh, I found the original!

18067
10:48:12,580 --> 10:48:13,060
The...

18068
10:48:13,060 --> 10:48:14,860
The nether...

18069
10:48:14,860 --> 10:48:16,740
The nether gate.

18070
10:48:17,140 --> 10:48:18,540
Not that gate, but the other one.

18071
10:48:18,540 --> 10:48:19,880
The very first one we ever found.

18072
10:48:20,420 --> 10:48:25,280
Are you sure you're not confusing this with another server that we were on?

18073
10:48:25,460 --> 10:48:25,940
No.

18074
10:48:26,160 --> 10:48:27,560
I know what I saw.

18075
10:48:27,800 --> 10:48:30,260
I know exactly what I saw.

18076
10:48:31,140 --> 10:48:31,700
Okay.

18077
10:48:31,920 --> 10:48:33,120
I'll believe you.

18078
10:48:34,140 --> 10:48:35,640
I don't know anything anymore.

18079
10:48:36,080 --> 10:48:37,220
I just wanna sleep.

18080
10:48:38,180 --> 10:48:38,400
Okay.

18081
10:48:39,700 --> 10:48:44,600
The gamer says, I bet you we're gonna beat the ender dragon within two hours.

18082
10:48:45,000 --> 10:48:46,540
If you...

18083
10:48:46,540 --> 10:48:48,780
Within two hours?

18084
10:48:49,240 --> 10:48:50,440
The sun will be rising!

18085
10:48:50,980 --> 10:48:53,460
Within two hours, it's gonna be...

18086
10:48:53,460 --> 10:48:54,320
Trust me.

18087
10:48:54,620 --> 10:48:56,620
Within two hours, it's gonna...

18088
10:48:56,620 --> 10:48:57,580
We're gonna make it.

18089
10:48:57,960 --> 10:48:59,100
It's just...

18090
10:48:59,100 --> 10:49:02,700
We just get all the materials we need and we're there.

18091
10:49:03,020 --> 10:49:03,480
We're there.

18092
10:49:04,060 --> 10:49:07,160
If we don't make it, if it's not two hours, what do you owe me?

18093
10:49:07,260 --> 10:49:08,000
What are you gonna give me?

18094
10:49:08,180 --> 10:49:09,940
Then it'll be within three hours.

18095
10:49:10,180 --> 10:49:12,720
My calculations was just a little wrong.

18096
10:49:12,940 --> 10:49:14,240
Just a little bit wrong.

18097
10:49:14,240 --> 10:49:15,400
It was just...

18098
10:49:15,400 --> 10:49:18,140
It'll be within two to three hours.

18099
10:49:18,260 --> 10:49:18,720
How about that?

18100
10:49:18,840 --> 10:49:21,300
Two to three more hours.

18101
10:49:22,100 --> 10:49:23,600
Are you really gonna...

18102
10:49:23,600 --> 10:49:25,540
Are you really not gonna...

18103
10:49:26,060 --> 10:49:28,240
My stream title...

18104
10:49:30,180 --> 10:49:33,440
Make sure...

18105
10:49:33,440 --> 10:49:36,460
We're gonna be really stacked up.

18106
10:49:36,740 --> 10:49:39,400
We're gonna be so stacked up.

18107
10:49:39,680 --> 10:49:41,580
Guys, what do I need to do to make arrows again?

18108
10:49:41,700 --> 10:49:43,040
I have 15 feathers.

18109
10:49:44,980 --> 10:49:46,540
Oh, you need flint also.

18110
10:49:46,820 --> 10:49:47,440
Do you have flint?

18111
10:49:48,260 --> 10:49:49,940
No, you gotta get that in the...

18112
10:49:49,940 --> 10:49:50,520
What's it called?

18113
10:49:52,100 --> 10:49:52,660
In the...

18114
10:49:52,660 --> 10:49:53,540
In the mines.

18115
10:49:54,140 --> 10:49:55,380
In the gravel.

18116
10:49:55,740 --> 10:49:58,360
Oh my god, remember when we threw away all those gravel?

18117
10:49:59,420 --> 10:50:01,400
No, but we would have to mine...

18118
10:50:01,400 --> 10:50:04,020
We would have to place those gravels and then dig them.

18119
10:50:04,020 --> 10:50:04,900
It would be torture.

18120
10:50:05,340 --> 10:50:06,300
Just find some water.

18121
10:50:06,300 --> 10:50:07,400
Just find some water.

18122
10:50:10,740 --> 10:50:14,300
Remember when we had all those gravels?

18123
10:50:15,100 --> 10:50:15,500
Yeah.

18124
10:50:15,720 --> 10:50:17,780
I had so much gravel.

18125
10:50:18,300 --> 10:50:19,040
What were we gonna do?

18126
10:50:19,140 --> 10:50:21,700
Just take stacks and stacks and stacks of gravel?

18127
10:50:22,300 --> 10:50:22,780
Yeah.

18128
10:50:24,040 --> 10:50:25,780
Yeah, that's what we were gonna do.

18129
10:50:25,960 --> 10:50:27,740
What else were we gonna do?

18130
10:50:30,460 --> 10:50:31,840
Just trade from the...

18131
10:50:31,840 --> 10:50:34,240
How do we get a Fletcher Villager?

18132
10:50:34,240 --> 10:50:34,600
How?

18133
10:50:35,600 --> 10:50:37,400
I have a Fletcher Villager.

18134
10:50:38,000 --> 10:50:39,280
I'm at a village right now.

18135
10:50:39,680 --> 10:50:41,920
I gotta trade some arrows right now.

18136
10:50:42,800 --> 10:50:44,100
Hold on, let me see.

18137
10:50:44,280 --> 10:50:46,240
Wait, the Fletcher is the map guy, right?

18138
10:50:47,680 --> 10:50:49,080
I don't fucking know.

18139
10:50:49,820 --> 10:50:51,200
I was just reading my chat.

18140
10:50:52,800 --> 10:50:53,860
The Fletching Table.

18141
10:50:55,140 --> 10:50:55,520
No?

18142
10:50:55,780 --> 10:50:56,900
What's the Fletching Table?

18143
10:50:57,200 --> 10:50:58,320
I don't fucking know.

18144
10:50:59,680 --> 10:51:01,900
Oh, I know what it looks like.

18145
10:51:01,900 --> 10:51:02,920
What's this guy do?

18146
10:51:03,040 --> 10:51:03,960
What do you have?

18147
10:51:04,420 --> 10:51:06,540
Oh, you're a cartographer.

18148
10:51:07,360 --> 10:51:09,320
Yeah, that's the guy that makes maps.

18149
10:51:09,980 --> 10:51:12,100
I'm starting to get a headache, man.

18150
10:51:12,720 --> 10:51:14,220
Why are there two cartographers?

18151
10:51:14,360 --> 10:51:15,320
Okay, I'm leaving this village.

18152
10:51:15,500 --> 10:51:17,460
You can make a Fletcher thing.

18153
10:51:17,560 --> 10:51:18,940
You can make a Fletcher thing.

18154
10:51:19,640 --> 10:51:20,580
What do I need?

18155
10:51:20,780 --> 10:51:21,320
I don't know.

18156
10:51:21,720 --> 10:51:22,400
What do they need?

18157
10:51:23,540 --> 10:51:25,180
I need to become a Fletcher.

18158
10:51:25,820 --> 10:51:26,740
What do they need?

18159
10:51:26,740 --> 10:51:28,000
Hold on.

18160
10:51:28,100 --> 10:51:30,840
I'm putting down the crafting table.

18161
10:51:31,340 --> 10:51:33,060
Oh my god, I'm actually almost there.

18162
10:51:33,180 --> 10:51:34,080
For real this time.

18163
10:51:34,740 --> 10:51:36,100
Oh, I need flint!

18164
10:51:36,300 --> 10:51:37,200
I need flint!

18165
10:51:39,020 --> 10:51:41,120
We always need flint.

18166
10:51:42,580 --> 10:51:43,740
I'm actually there.

18167
10:51:43,840 --> 10:51:46,100
I'm legitimately there.

18168
10:51:47,240 --> 10:51:48,360
I'm actually...

18169
10:51:48,360 --> 10:51:49,660
When do we get a middle point?

18170
10:51:50,560 --> 10:51:52,420
No, I can't get all my stuff.

18171
10:51:53,580 --> 10:51:56,140
I'm only a thousand away on each side.

18172
10:51:56,140 --> 10:51:56,820
Okay.

18173
10:51:57,360 --> 10:51:59,760
So we're both very, very close.

18174
10:52:00,280 --> 10:52:00,440
Yeah.

18175
10:52:02,840 --> 10:52:04,640
What's the plan when we get there?

18176
10:52:05,640 --> 10:52:07,200
What do we need to make first?

18177
10:52:08,400 --> 10:52:08,880
Sleep.

18178
10:52:10,000 --> 10:52:11,260
What do we need to make first?

18179
10:52:11,520 --> 10:52:14,140
I think we should make the potions first.

18180
10:52:14,820 --> 10:52:16,560
Because I have all the stuff for the potions.

18181
10:52:17,780 --> 10:52:19,460
There's a village to my right?

18182
10:52:20,320 --> 10:52:21,600
Oh, there is!

18183
10:52:21,940 --> 10:52:24,100
Oh my god, what is in that village?

18184
10:52:24,100 --> 10:52:25,020
What is that?

18185
10:52:26,340 --> 10:52:27,760
Wait, we can sleep now, right?

18186
10:52:27,800 --> 10:52:29,120
We don't need the phantoms, right?

18187
10:52:29,920 --> 10:52:30,960
Oh, true, true, true.

18188
10:52:31,360 --> 10:52:33,020
Okay, no more.

18189
10:52:33,360 --> 10:52:35,980
Even if we need it, we'll just stay up again.

18190
10:52:36,080 --> 10:52:36,640
Let's just sleep.

18191
10:52:37,180 --> 10:52:39,060
Alright, we're very good at that.

18192
10:52:40,500 --> 10:52:41,240
Alright, I'm sleeping.

18193
10:52:43,740 --> 10:52:44,500
I'm sleeping.

18194
10:52:45,240 --> 10:52:46,840
Please sleep, oh my god.

18195
10:52:47,960 --> 10:52:50,360
Okay, I'm heading to the village next to me.

18196
10:52:50,480 --> 10:52:52,700
To see if there's more stuff I need.

18197
10:52:53,080 --> 10:52:55,460
I'm so tired, I didn't even put the boat in the water.

18198
10:52:55,600 --> 10:52:56,520
I put it on the land.

18199
10:52:56,620 --> 10:52:57,600
I thought it was water.

18200
10:52:58,200 --> 10:53:00,880
Okay, this is a village we haven't desecrated yet.

18201
10:53:01,340 --> 10:53:03,060
Oh my god, I'm at another village.

18202
10:53:03,500 --> 10:53:04,780
Wait, that was just one house.

18203
10:53:06,100 --> 10:53:07,240
Oh no, the other village...

18204
10:53:07,240 --> 10:53:08,680
Oh my god, the other houses are over there.

18205
10:53:08,980 --> 10:53:10,340
I was gonna say, how is there one house?

18206
10:53:10,580 --> 10:53:11,600
Wait, are we in the same village?

18207
10:53:11,760 --> 10:53:12,900
No, I don't see your name.

18208
10:53:14,560 --> 10:53:15,400
I don't know.

18209
10:53:15,740 --> 10:53:18,780
No, we've farmed this house.

18210
10:53:19,060 --> 10:53:20,760
But we might have missed some stuff.

18211
10:53:21,460 --> 10:53:22,000
Maybe?

18212
10:53:22,680 --> 10:53:23,520
I don't recognize this one.

18213
10:53:23,660 --> 10:53:24,760
I don't know either.

18214
10:53:25,620 --> 10:53:26,720
They all look the same.

18215
10:53:26,840 --> 10:53:28,980
I don't remember if they opened the door.

18216
10:53:29,080 --> 10:53:32,420
Or if I fucking harvested this house already.

18217
10:53:33,320 --> 10:53:35,260
Maybe they just opened these doors.

18218
10:53:36,140 --> 10:53:37,600
No, I definitely haven't been here before.

18219
10:53:37,660 --> 10:53:38,340
No, I haven't been here.

18220
10:53:38,420 --> 10:53:39,660
There's a brewing stand too.

18221
10:53:40,460 --> 10:53:41,880
Oh, there's raw meat.

18222
10:53:42,160 --> 10:53:42,780
Oh my god.

18223
10:53:43,580 --> 10:53:45,140
Why do you refrigerate that?

18224
10:53:45,600 --> 10:53:47,700
Is there books?

18225
10:53:47,700 --> 10:53:49,300
Where are the books?

18226
10:53:50,200 --> 10:53:51,700
Taking their emeralds because...

18227
10:53:56,260 --> 10:53:58,480
They have emeralds, they have apples.

18228
10:53:58,720 --> 10:53:59,660
We don't need any of those.

18229
10:54:00,380 --> 10:54:03,180
Taking their emeralds in case we need to trade.

18230
10:54:04,840 --> 10:54:05,600
For arrows.

18231
10:54:07,260 --> 10:54:08,200
Oh, books, books!

18232
10:54:08,360 --> 10:54:09,860
Get them, get them!

18233
10:54:11,180 --> 10:54:12,000
Grabbing hay.

18234
10:54:13,440 --> 10:54:14,860
Checking if there's books here.

18235
10:54:15,700 --> 10:54:17,760
Guys, I need to grab the hay first.

18236
10:54:17,980 --> 10:54:19,460
Before I think of anything else.

18237
10:54:19,880 --> 10:54:21,280
Do I need gas tears?

18238
10:54:21,400 --> 10:54:22,180
I don't remember.

18239
10:54:22,340 --> 10:54:23,600
I keep asking if I need gas tears.

18240
10:54:23,640 --> 10:54:26,960
Oh my god, what did I accidentally click?

18241
10:54:27,260 --> 10:54:28,560
What does the gas tear...

18242
10:54:28,560 --> 10:54:30,540
I'm getting rid of the golden chestplate.

18243
10:54:30,640 --> 10:54:31,200
I can't remember.

18244
10:54:33,200 --> 10:54:34,560
Where's the gas tear?

18245
10:54:35,900 --> 10:54:36,820
Obsidian can go.

18246
10:54:36,960 --> 10:54:37,580
Yeah, you're right.

18247
10:54:38,660 --> 10:54:40,600
Oh, regen.

18248
10:54:40,840 --> 10:54:42,060
Yeah, we want the gas tears.

18249
10:54:42,060 --> 10:54:43,120
We want the gas tears.

18250
10:54:43,360 --> 10:54:45,420
I got the gas tear on me then.

18251
10:54:45,760 --> 10:54:46,940
I have one.

18252
10:54:49,480 --> 10:54:50,880
Is this a library?

18253
10:54:51,480 --> 10:54:52,500
What's over here?

18254
10:54:53,020 --> 10:54:55,360
What's over here?

18255
10:54:56,120 --> 10:54:58,080
Oh, it is stonecutter.

18256
10:54:58,160 --> 10:55:00,120
Alright, time to go back to...

18257
10:55:00,680 --> 10:55:01,340
The coordinates!

18258
10:55:03,320 --> 10:55:04,340
Oh, there's a chicken.

18259
10:55:05,260 --> 10:55:06,060
Get over here.

18260
10:55:06,240 --> 10:55:07,080
I need your feather.

18261
10:55:07,920 --> 10:55:09,760
Get over here, I need your feather.

18262
10:55:12,060 --> 10:55:13,900
Big boss, help me.

18263
10:55:13,980 --> 10:55:15,380
Oh my god, we're so close.

18264
10:55:15,520 --> 10:55:16,360
We're so close.

18265
10:55:17,740 --> 10:55:18,880
Solidus, please.

18266
10:55:19,620 --> 10:55:20,740
Solidus, save me.

18267
10:55:22,280 --> 10:55:23,460
Solidus is...

18268
10:55:23,930 --> 10:55:24,300
Solidus.

18269
10:55:25,140 --> 10:55:26,920
We're so close.

18270
10:55:27,540 --> 10:55:28,460
We're so close.

18271
10:55:28,880 --> 10:55:30,720
Mint can do this.

18272
10:55:30,820 --> 10:55:32,420
I believe in Mint.

18273
10:55:34,520 --> 10:55:36,060
Mint, stay strong.

18274
10:55:36,380 --> 10:55:38,340
We just need three more hours.

18275
10:55:38,640 --> 10:55:39,680
Stay strong.

18276
10:55:39,680 --> 10:55:42,180
Stay strong for me.

18277
10:55:42,180 --> 10:55:43,840
I found a lot more books.

18278
10:55:44,280 --> 10:55:45,880
That's good, that's good, that's good.

18279
10:55:52,760 --> 10:55:54,440
Oh, there's...

18280
10:55:54,440 --> 10:55:55,840
This is a good village, actually.

18281
10:55:57,280 --> 10:55:57,700
Yeah.

18282
10:55:59,320 --> 10:56:01,220
Okay, I'm in the jungle.

18283
10:56:02,440 --> 10:56:04,500
The mighty jungle.

18284
10:56:05,280 --> 10:56:07,880
The lion sleeps tonight.

18285
10:56:09,060 --> 10:56:10,680
Is somebody sleeping?

18286
10:56:11,480 --> 10:56:12,580
Oh, me.

18287
10:56:14,520 --> 10:56:20,660
Just think about how great it's gonna feel when we beat the Ender Dragon.

18288
10:56:21,040 --> 10:56:22,280
Just think about how great it's gonna feel when we beat the Ender Dragon.

18289
10:56:22,300 --> 10:56:25,060
I won't have any reflexes to beat the Ender Dragon.

18290
10:56:25,080 --> 10:56:26,920
No, just think about it.

18291
10:56:27,020 --> 10:56:31,280
You're gonna get that last lock-in moment right there.

18292
10:56:31,760 --> 10:56:33,100
Right now.

18293
10:56:33,940 --> 10:56:35,720
Okay guys, what's the chords again?

18294
10:56:36,080 --> 10:56:37,040
What are the chords?

18295
10:56:37,740 --> 10:56:38,980
What's the chords?

18296
10:56:39,300 --> 10:56:40,080
I'm fucking...

18297
10:56:40,080 --> 10:56:41,240
I lost track.

18298
10:56:41,620 --> 10:56:42,560
What if we get to the end?

18299
10:56:42,560 --> 10:56:44,940
And then do the Ender Dragon tomorrow?

18300
10:56:45,540 --> 10:56:45,540
Mint.

18301
10:56:45,700 --> 10:56:46,040
Mint.

18302
10:56:46,720 --> 10:56:47,980
What if we did that?

18303
10:56:48,200 --> 10:56:50,200
It's gonna feel so good, Mint.

18304
10:56:50,260 --> 10:56:52,020
Just think about how good it's gonna feel.

18305
10:56:52,360 --> 10:56:54,180
I'm almost out of food.

18306
10:56:54,700 --> 10:56:56,460
I have food for you.

18307
10:56:56,980 --> 10:56:58,160
How are you out of food?

18308
10:56:58,220 --> 10:56:58,860
There's a village.

18309
10:57:01,000 --> 10:57:03,740
I took a melon slice.

18310
10:57:03,920 --> 10:57:04,380
Okay, okay.

18311
10:57:04,500 --> 10:57:05,020
That's good.

18312
10:57:05,720 --> 10:57:06,880
I'm drooling on myself.

18313
10:57:07,040 --> 10:57:07,620
I'm so tired.

18314
10:57:07,720 --> 10:57:08,520
Mint, I believe.

18315
10:57:08,520 --> 10:57:09,680
Mint.

18316
10:57:10,740 --> 10:57:11,660
Just...

18317
10:57:11,660 --> 10:57:12,800
Final stretch.

18318
10:57:13,380 --> 10:57:14,420
We're almost there.

18319
10:57:15,140 --> 10:57:16,900
We're almost there, Mint.

18320
10:57:18,280 --> 10:57:20,420
Mint, we're almost there.

18321
10:57:21,280 --> 10:57:22,000
Me too.

18322
10:57:22,120 --> 10:57:24,200
I'm almost too sleepy to end.

18323
10:57:24,580 --> 10:57:26,300
We're almost there, Mint.

18324
10:57:26,640 --> 10:57:28,620
Just stay strong.

18325
10:57:29,420 --> 10:57:30,740
Stay strong.

18326
10:57:31,460 --> 10:57:33,360
The coordinates are...

18327
10:57:33,360 --> 10:57:36,520
Negative four thousand...

18328
10:57:38,520 --> 10:57:39,860
I don't even know.

18329
10:57:40,140 --> 10:57:41,360
Negative four thousand something.

18330
10:57:42,200 --> 10:57:44,760
Negative four thousand one hundred and sixteen.

18331
10:57:45,000 --> 10:57:46,520
And one five seven six.

18332
10:57:47,880 --> 10:57:48,500
Yeah, oh.

18333
10:57:48,920 --> 10:57:49,720
Wait, you're there?

18334
10:57:49,920 --> 10:57:52,620
No, I'm literally like two hundred away.

18335
10:57:53,140 --> 10:57:54,400
Or four hundred away.

18336
10:57:54,620 --> 10:57:56,420
I'm a little ways, but...

18337
10:57:56,420 --> 10:57:57,520
I'm making my way.

18338
10:57:58,340 --> 10:58:00,460
Making my way downtown.

18339
10:58:01,200 --> 10:58:02,300
Walking back.

18340
10:58:02,300 --> 10:58:04,260
The past faces past.

18341
10:58:07,220 --> 10:58:07,820
Okay,

18342
10:58:13,040 --> 10:58:14,740
I am negative four thousand.

18343
10:58:15,100 --> 10:58:15,120
Okay.

18344
10:58:16,180 --> 10:58:16,740
Am I going the right way?

18345
10:58:16,740 --> 10:58:17,280
I am, okay.

18346
10:58:17,900 --> 10:58:19,540
Just running through the forest.

18347
10:58:20,220 --> 10:58:21,480
Oh my god, another village.

18348
10:58:21,980 --> 10:58:23,660
How many villages are you finding?

18349
10:58:24,240 --> 10:58:25,860
A lot, apparently.

18350
10:58:27,400 --> 10:58:29,100
Hey, you're finding all the villages.

18351
10:58:29,680 --> 10:58:30,940
Where were they before?

18352
10:58:32,420 --> 10:58:34,000
Wait, you're right.

18353
10:58:34,500 --> 10:58:36,380
Where were these villages before?

18354
10:58:36,380 --> 10:58:36,600
Where were these?

18355
10:58:37,260 --> 10:58:39,340
Where did they come from?

18356
10:58:41,920 --> 10:58:44,080
Where did they come from?

18357
10:58:44,080 --> 10:58:45,440
Where did they go?

18358
10:58:47,660 --> 10:58:49,180
Oh my god, wait.

18359
10:58:49,560 --> 10:58:51,540
Wait, I'm actually almost there.

18360
10:58:51,640 --> 10:58:52,520
I'm so close.

18361
10:58:52,660 --> 10:58:53,880
I'm so close.

18362
10:58:55,340 --> 10:58:57,380
What was the Z, guys?

18363
10:58:57,480 --> 10:58:58,400
What was the Z?

18364
10:58:59,420 --> 10:59:00,920
What did I just pick up?

18365
10:59:03,020 --> 10:59:05,040
Did I just pick up another gold chestplate?

18366
10:59:05,140 --> 10:59:07,200
I think this is where you were at just now.

18367
10:59:07,220 --> 10:59:09,280
Oh yeah, you were where I was!

18368
10:59:09,780 --> 10:59:11,000
You're almost there.

18369
10:59:11,240 --> 10:59:12,300
I'm almost there?

18370
10:59:12,420 --> 10:59:13,020
Okay, I'm leaving.

18371
10:59:13,360 --> 10:59:14,280
You're almost there.

18372
10:59:14,480 --> 10:59:16,880
That's literally my chestplate.

18373
10:59:16,980 --> 10:59:17,420
Yeah.

18374
10:59:17,940 --> 10:59:19,200
You picked it up.

18375
10:59:20,340 --> 10:59:21,620
It's where I left.

18376
10:59:22,100 --> 10:59:23,040
There's nothing there.

18377
10:59:23,140 --> 10:59:23,880
I already harvested.

18378
10:59:24,740 --> 10:59:25,720
No, I'm leaving.

18379
10:59:25,960 --> 10:59:26,420
I'm leaving.

18380
10:59:26,420 --> 10:59:27,800
Oh my god.

18381
10:59:27,880 --> 10:59:29,400
I think I almost just fell in a hole.

18382
10:59:29,760 --> 10:59:30,020
Okay.

18383
10:59:31,680 --> 10:59:32,320
Alright.

18384
10:59:33,280 --> 10:59:33,700
Okay.

18385
10:59:35,560 --> 10:59:36,840
1,600.

18386
10:59:37,540 --> 10:59:39,000
1,600.

18387
10:59:40,320 --> 10:59:41,600
I found it!

18388
10:59:41,740 --> 10:59:42,440
I found it!

18389
10:59:42,860 --> 10:59:44,360
It's in front of me!

18390
10:59:45,620 --> 10:59:46,800
I did it.

18391
10:59:46,860 --> 10:59:48,660
I found it.

18392
10:59:49,460 --> 10:59:51,880
We traveled so far.

18393
10:59:52,300 --> 10:59:53,420
It's over here.

18394
10:59:53,420 --> 10:59:55,620
I found the baby tower.

18395
10:59:56,600 --> 10:59:58,160
I found her home.

18396
10:59:58,680 --> 11:00:00,560
I actually found it.

18397
11:00:00,960 --> 11:00:02,340
Oh my god, there it is.

18398
11:00:02,680 --> 11:00:04,080
There's the water bucket.

18399
11:00:04,600 --> 11:00:05,880
Okay, I'm gonna...

18400
11:00:05,880 --> 11:00:07,220
Okay, what do we need?

18401
11:00:07,280 --> 11:00:08,660
What do we need, Mint?

18402
11:00:09,480 --> 11:00:10,740
What do we need?

18403
11:00:10,840 --> 11:00:12,680
I'm gonna put the stuff.

18404
11:00:12,780 --> 11:00:14,220
Putting potion stuff here.

18405
11:00:14,760 --> 11:00:16,760
And then, I'm gonna...

18406
11:00:16,760 --> 11:00:17,680
Wait, is there flint?

18407
11:00:17,800 --> 11:00:18,780
We have flint.

18408
11:00:18,780 --> 11:00:19,620
We have flint.

18409
11:00:19,740 --> 11:00:21,300
How much arrow per flint?

18410
11:00:22,440 --> 11:00:24,120
I think it's one.

18411
11:00:24,620 --> 11:00:25,480
Okay, arrow.

18412
11:00:26,800 --> 11:00:28,160
Am I going the right way, guys?

18413
11:00:28,960 --> 11:00:30,460
I'm going the right way.

18414
11:00:30,940 --> 11:00:31,920
I'm almost there.

18415
11:00:31,980 --> 11:00:33,460
I'm just a couple hundred away.

18416
11:00:33,460 --> 11:00:34,960
I have 37.

18417
11:00:35,420 --> 11:00:36,720
I have 37 arrows.

18418
11:00:36,860 --> 11:00:40,300
I'm putting the redstone dust.

18419
11:00:40,740 --> 11:00:42,960
I'm putting the redstone dust here.

18420
11:00:43,460 --> 11:00:45,020
And then...

18421
11:00:45,020 --> 11:00:46,100
And then...

18422
11:00:46,100 --> 11:00:48,260
What am I doing still?

18423
11:00:56,340 --> 11:00:58,200
Mint, stay strong.

18424
11:00:58,380 --> 11:00:59,520
Stay strong, Mint.

18425
11:00:59,900 --> 11:01:01,120
Stay strong.

18426
11:01:02,480 --> 11:01:03,160
Stay, Mint.

18427
11:01:03,360 --> 11:01:04,660
I believe in you.

18428
11:01:05,760 --> 11:01:07,020
Stay strong.

18429
11:01:07,180 --> 11:01:08,040
Stay strong.

18430
11:01:12,840 --> 11:01:14,520
Okay, I have the wood.

18431
11:01:15,440 --> 11:01:15,960
Okay.

18432
11:01:16,840 --> 11:01:18,360
I have the wood.

18433
11:01:19,760 --> 11:01:21,140
Oh, I need to go this way.

18434
11:01:21,240 --> 11:01:22,320
I need to get out of the water.

18435
11:01:27,080 --> 11:01:28,120
I'm grabbing...

18436
11:01:28,120 --> 11:01:29,700
Where the fuck is the wood?

18437
11:01:30,200 --> 11:01:31,720
Wait, do we have enough wood?

18438
11:01:32,380 --> 11:01:32,880
I do.

18439
11:01:33,400 --> 11:01:35,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

18440
11:01:35,760 --> 11:01:37,600
I have wood.

18441
11:01:38,240 --> 11:01:39,180
I have wood.

18442
11:01:39,780 --> 11:01:40,660
Don't fall.

18443
11:01:41,640 --> 11:01:42,980
I have wood.

18444
11:01:43,320 --> 11:01:43,520
Alright.

18445
11:01:45,760 --> 11:01:46,820
I'm running.

18446
11:01:47,100 --> 11:01:48,500
I'm running.

18447
11:01:50,860 --> 11:01:51,500
Okay.

18448
11:01:52,120 --> 11:01:54,320
I have...

18449
11:01:54,320 --> 11:01:56,080
I got you, Mint.

18450
11:01:56,360 --> 11:01:57,540
You can do this.

18451
11:01:58,080 --> 11:01:59,640
We're at the finish line.

18452
11:02:00,100 --> 11:02:02,000
We have everything we need.

18453
11:02:02,160 --> 11:02:04,980
We literally have everything we need.

18454
11:02:05,000 --> 11:02:06,540
Did you make arrows already?

18455
11:02:06,540 --> 11:02:08,420
Yeah, yeah, I made 37 arrows.

18456
11:02:08,560 --> 11:02:09,960
That is more than enough.

18457
11:02:09,960 --> 11:02:11,240
That's not enough.

18458
11:02:11,540 --> 11:02:14,360
I have 20 spectral arrows.

18459
11:02:15,400 --> 11:02:16,160
That's not enough.

18460
11:02:16,180 --> 11:02:17,980
How is that not enough?

18461
11:02:18,280 --> 11:02:19,600
How do we need more?

18462
11:02:20,160 --> 11:02:20,720
Oh my God.

18463
11:02:20,800 --> 11:02:24,400
We have to hit the things to be able to kill the dragon.

18464
11:02:24,400 --> 11:02:25,100
I can hit them.

18465
11:02:25,400 --> 11:02:27,240
I can hit it.

18466
11:02:27,680 --> 11:02:29,660
I can hit it.

18467
11:02:30,020 --> 11:02:31,180
It's so easy.

18468
11:02:31,340 --> 11:02:33,180
I can hit it so easy.

18469
11:02:34,400 --> 11:02:35,620
How are you hitting the thing?

18470
11:02:35,760 --> 11:02:36,560
I don't know.

18471
11:02:36,560 --> 11:02:37,240
I can hit it.

18472
11:02:37,240 --> 11:02:39,080
You can?

18473
11:02:39,520 --> 11:02:39,880
Okay.

18474
11:02:40,420 --> 11:02:41,280
I can hit it.

18475
11:02:41,400 --> 11:02:42,700
I've done it before.

18476
11:02:43,000 --> 11:02:44,240
I can hit it.

18477
11:02:44,280 --> 11:02:44,700
Okay.

18478
11:02:45,220 --> 11:02:47,240
This is a fancy village.

18479
11:02:47,860 --> 11:02:50,540
I'm gonna go to sleep now in real life.

18480
11:02:50,880 --> 11:02:51,240
No.

18481
11:02:51,780 --> 11:02:52,240
No.

18482
11:02:53,260 --> 11:02:54,740
Just make it here.

18483
11:02:55,020 --> 11:02:58,620
Make it to the last destination.

18484
11:02:59,720 --> 11:03:01,180
The last goal.

18485
11:03:01,180 --> 11:03:01,360
The last goal.

18486
11:03:04,890 --> 11:03:06,420
Just make it here, man.

18487
11:03:06,920 --> 11:03:08,060
Make it here.

18488
11:03:08,220 --> 11:03:09,800
At least make it to the end.

18489
11:03:11,840 --> 11:03:13,060
Okay, I don't get it.

18490
11:03:13,640 --> 11:03:14,140
Go to sleep.

18491
11:03:17,830 --> 11:03:18,450
Alright.

18492
11:03:19,710 --> 11:03:20,630
Let's see.

18493
11:03:23,190 --> 11:03:25,310
I refreshed that person.

18494
11:03:26,470 --> 11:03:27,090
Arrow.

18495
11:03:27,270 --> 11:03:28,550
They're sleeping in their bed.

18496
11:03:29,390 --> 11:03:30,390
Okay, I have 45.

18497
11:03:30,390 --> 11:03:32,530
I have 45 arrows now.

18498
11:03:33,890 --> 11:03:35,470
Oh my god.

18499
11:03:36,450 --> 11:03:38,070
How do I make beds?

18500
11:03:38,250 --> 11:03:38,490
Okay.

18501
11:03:39,490 --> 11:03:39,910
Bed.

18502
11:03:40,770 --> 11:03:41,290
Bed.

18503
11:03:42,970 --> 11:03:44,230
That's fine.

18504
11:03:44,510 --> 11:03:46,250
That's enough beds, I think.

18505
11:03:47,650 --> 11:03:50,770
I can make one more bed for attacking.

18506
11:03:56,670 --> 11:03:58,350
And then...

18507
11:03:58,350 --> 11:03:59,950
Let's see.

18508
11:04:00,230 --> 11:04:02,110
I don't need bone.

18509
11:04:02,970 --> 11:04:04,470
We don't need coal.

18510
11:04:05,630 --> 11:04:06,210
We...

18511
11:04:06,210 --> 11:04:08,030
don't need gold.

18512
11:04:18,200 --> 11:04:18,990
Let's see.

18513
11:04:22,140 --> 11:04:23,710
Okay, we have...

18514
11:04:23,710 --> 11:04:25,050
11 enders.

18515
11:04:25,050 --> 11:04:26,630
We have...

18516
11:04:26,630 --> 11:04:27,930
This is a strong potion.

18517
11:04:28,250 --> 11:04:31,310
Okay, I'm putting potion stuff in your chest right now.

18518
11:04:31,390 --> 11:04:32,670
You're the potions person.

18519
11:04:32,830 --> 11:04:34,790
I don't know how potions work.

18520
11:04:35,050 --> 11:04:36,730
I don't know how they work.

18521
11:04:36,850 --> 11:04:37,870
No, don't do it.

18522
11:04:37,930 --> 11:04:38,370
Don't do it.

18523
11:04:38,410 --> 11:04:39,270
Please let me do it.

18524
11:04:39,490 --> 11:04:42,270
I put all the potion things in your chest.

18525
11:04:42,410 --> 11:04:43,850
You have all the potion stuff.

18526
11:04:44,010 --> 11:04:46,030
You have all the potion stuff.

18527
11:04:46,090 --> 11:04:47,470
I didn't touch anything.

18528
11:04:47,650 --> 11:04:49,830
You have all of them.

18529
11:04:50,230 --> 11:04:52,790
And then I'm giving you 12 books.

18530
11:04:55,530 --> 11:04:56,170
And...

18531
11:04:56,170 --> 11:04:56,630
Make...

18532
11:04:56,630 --> 11:04:58,090
Find obsidian.

18533
11:04:58,370 --> 11:05:01,370
We need to make the enchanting table.

18534
11:05:04,550 --> 11:05:05,190
Enchanting...

18535
11:05:05,190 --> 11:05:07,050
1, 2, 3...

18536
11:05:07,050 --> 11:05:08,830
I'm harvesting this nether portal.

18537
11:05:09,010 --> 11:05:10,150
We don't need it anymore.

18538
11:05:10,890 --> 11:05:11,970
I'm harvesting it.

18539
11:05:12,170 --> 11:05:12,590
Goodbye.

18540
11:05:13,210 --> 11:05:14,630
Goodbye, nether portal.

18541
11:05:15,210 --> 11:05:17,230
We never need you anymore.

18542
11:05:17,390 --> 11:05:18,490
We don't need you.

18543
11:05:18,490 --> 11:05:20,070
Okay, I'm a couple hundred away.

18544
11:05:20,070 --> 11:05:21,630
I'm on my way.

18545
11:05:21,710 --> 11:05:23,250
Goodbye, nether...

18546
11:05:24,130 --> 11:05:24,590
Goodbye.

18547
11:05:25,190 --> 11:05:26,770
We're never coming back.

18548
11:05:27,050 --> 11:05:28,330
Oh, we have 4 in the chest.

18549
11:05:29,890 --> 11:05:30,570
It's okay.

18550
11:05:30,670 --> 11:05:31,930
I needed to break that anyway.

18551
11:05:32,450 --> 11:05:33,810
We're never coming back here.

18552
11:05:34,290 --> 11:05:36,210
We're never coming back.

18553
11:05:36,490 --> 11:05:38,250
Do you want to try and do a...

18554
11:05:38,250 --> 11:05:39,610
A pillager raid?

18555
11:05:39,750 --> 11:05:41,450
So we can get a totem of undying.

18556
11:05:41,870 --> 11:05:43,110
That's a good idea.

18557
11:05:43,430 --> 11:05:45,650
I have an omnispanner.

18558
11:05:45,890 --> 11:05:46,990
How do we get the pillager?

18559
11:05:48,010 --> 11:05:50,190
I think it's the...

18560
11:05:50,190 --> 11:05:52,290
I think it's the potion we got.

18561
11:05:52,510 --> 11:05:53,370
The ominous?

18562
11:05:54,010 --> 11:05:54,430
Yeah.

18563
11:05:54,750 --> 11:05:56,930
The ominous bottle gives you...

18564
11:05:56,930 --> 11:05:57,650
What's happening?

18565
11:05:58,050 --> 11:05:58,710
Oh, it's raining.

18566
11:05:58,890 --> 11:05:59,530
That scared me.

18567
11:06:03,170 --> 11:06:04,450
Oh my god, okay.

18568
11:06:05,470 --> 11:06:06,550
Oh yeah, enchanting table.

18569
11:06:06,550 --> 11:06:08,990
I mean, we don't have to get it, but...

18570
11:06:09,710 --> 11:06:10,130
Okay.

18571
11:06:11,550 --> 11:06:12,110
Enchanting...

18572
11:06:12,110 --> 11:06:12,910
I got the table.

18573
11:06:13,630 --> 11:06:15,690
I see the PP tower.

18574
11:06:15,930 --> 11:06:16,530
You see it?

18575
11:06:16,590 --> 11:06:17,350
Where are you?

18576
11:06:17,890 --> 11:06:19,330
I don't see you.

18577
11:06:19,510 --> 11:06:21,130
I don't see you.

18578
11:06:21,210 --> 11:06:22,190
Where are you?

18579
11:06:25,330 --> 11:06:26,730
I see you too.

18580
11:06:33,900 --> 11:06:35,200
Everything we need.

18581
11:06:35,560 --> 11:06:36,600
We have everything.

18582
11:06:36,760 --> 11:06:37,960
I bought you the enchant.

18583
11:06:38,280 --> 11:06:40,300
We have everything, man.

18584
11:06:40,840 --> 11:06:42,500
We're so close.

18585
11:06:42,660 --> 11:06:43,780
We have everything.

18586
11:06:44,800 --> 11:06:46,080
I have beds.

18587
11:06:46,220 --> 11:06:47,540
I have arrows.

18588
11:06:47,760 --> 11:06:49,860
We have all the potion stuff.

18589
11:06:49,860 --> 11:06:51,280
We have red dust.

18590
11:06:52,940 --> 11:06:54,960
Everything we need is right here.

18591
11:06:55,480 --> 11:06:57,840
It's right here.

18592
11:06:58,520 --> 11:06:59,800
It's right here.

18593
11:06:59,900 --> 11:07:00,620
We did it.

18594
11:07:01,020 --> 11:07:02,860
We traveled so far.

18595
11:07:03,400 --> 11:07:04,620
We did it.

18596
11:07:05,040 --> 11:07:06,460
We got everything.

18597
11:07:08,740 --> 11:07:10,400
We have everything.

18598
11:07:11,100 --> 11:07:12,900
Should we make a new stream?

18599
11:07:14,300 --> 11:07:15,140
We should.

18600
11:07:16,060 --> 11:07:18,560
Are we committing to the end?

18601
11:07:20,760 --> 11:07:21,880
I mean...

18602
11:07:21,880 --> 11:07:22,040
I don't know anymore.

18603
11:07:22,500 --> 11:07:23,960
I don't know.

18604
11:07:29,240 --> 11:07:30,340
I don't know.

18605
11:07:30,480 --> 11:07:31,680
This is your choice, Mint.

18606
11:07:31,960 --> 11:07:33,380
You're past your bedtime.

18607
11:07:33,760 --> 11:07:35,380
Like, you know I'm a night owl.

18608
11:07:38,060 --> 11:07:42,080
I thought we were going to the end.

18609
11:07:43,060 --> 11:07:44,440
You wanna go to the end?

18610
11:07:45,440 --> 11:07:46,380
Are we doing it?

18611
11:07:46,380 --> 11:07:48,160
Are we doing it, Mint?

18612
11:07:48,260 --> 11:07:50,180
Are we doing it to the end?

18613
11:07:51,500 --> 11:07:53,560
My second win.

18614
11:07:54,280 --> 11:07:58,580
Let's make our Let's make our stream.

18615
11:08:02,200 --> 11:08:04,420
Mint, I believe it.

18616
11:08:06,020 --> 11:08:08,300
Mint, you can do this.

18617
11:08:08,460 --> 11:08:10,380
I believe it.

18618
11:08:10,380 --> 11:08:11,840
I am.

18619
11:08:17,680 --> 11:08:18,240
Okay.

18620
11:08:21,380 --> 11:08:23,160
I'm making my room too.

18621
11:08:24,720 --> 11:08:25,780
I don't know what to do anymore.

18622
11:08:25,920 --> 11:08:27,500
Mint, I can't believe it.

18623
11:08:29,620 --> 11:08:30,780
Oh my god.

18624
11:08:33,040 --> 11:08:33,600
Alright.

18625
11:08:34,380 --> 11:08:36,140
Oh, I can't fucking remake.

18626
11:08:36,280 --> 11:08:37,940
Oh, I can't use the same settings.

18627
11:08:37,940 --> 11:08:43,880
I have to I have to copy everything over again.

18628
11:08:45,960 --> 11:08:47,080
Me too.

18629
11:08:47,440 --> 11:08:48,340
Oh my god.

18630
11:08:48,380 --> 11:08:48,760
Okay.

18631
11:08:49,440 --> 11:08:51,700
I always make a new one anyway though.

18632
11:08:53,500 --> 11:08:56,560
I didn't realize you gotta end your stream to be able to copy it.

18633
11:08:56,640 --> 11:08:59,300
I thought you could copy existing stuff.

18634
11:09:10,570 --> 11:09:18,250
We have one We have one one life to make this happen.

18635
11:09:20,170 --> 11:09:22,710
Is it night time?

18636
11:09:23,170 --> 11:09:23,910
I don't know.

18637
11:09:24,290 --> 11:09:25,270
I don't know.

18638
11:09:25,430 --> 11:09:26,670
I'm making my room.

18639
11:09:26,890 --> 11:09:28,750
We'll hear the monsters if it is.

18640
11:09:29,230 --> 11:09:30,650
We'll hear the monsters.

18641
11:09:30,990 --> 11:09:32,630
I think we're okay.

18642
11:09:34,910 --> 11:09:35,430
Okay.

18643
11:09:35,510 --> 11:09:37,070
We're making our waiting room.

18644
11:09:37,110 --> 11:09:38,090
We're doing it.

18645
11:09:38,190 --> 11:09:39,990
We're making our waiting rooms.

18646
11:09:40,530 --> 11:09:41,110
Oh my god.

18647
11:09:41,150 --> 11:09:42,550
Why can't I at you?

18648
11:09:42,550 --> 11:09:44,530
I don't know.

18649
11:09:44,650 --> 11:09:45,950
I won't let you do it.

18650
11:09:45,970 --> 11:09:47,290
It's so stupid.

18651
11:09:47,530 --> 11:09:48,230
I hate that.

18652
11:09:48,570 --> 11:09:52,150
It bugs out sometimes too.

18653
11:09:52,290 --> 11:09:53,990
4.20 AM.

18654
11:09:54,370 --> 11:09:54,710
Okay.

I'm not even gonna change the tags or anything.

18657
11:10:00,290 --> 11:10:02,210
I'm not even gonna change the tags.

18658
11:10:02,430 --> 11:10:04,290
I'm just gonna put...

18659
11:10:04,290 --> 11:10:05,550
I'm gonna put...

18660
11:10:05,550 --> 11:10:06,170
Minecraft.

18661
11:10:07,570 --> 11:10:08,750
Alright guys.

18662
11:10:08,870 --> 11:10:11,990
I'm waiting to my next stream as well.

18663
11:10:12,750 --> 11:10:13,390
We'll see you.

18664
11:10:13,470 --> 11:10:16,390
We'll see you in the second room.

18665
11:10:16,950 --> 11:10:18,910
We'll see you in the second room.

Bye bye.

18668
11:10:21,590 --> 11:10:24,690
I didn't even finish making my room yet.

18669
11:10:25,210 --> 11:10:25,670
I didn't.

18670
11:10:26,730 --> 11:10:27,550
Bye bye.

18671
11:10:28,810 --> 11:10:29,450
Okay.

18672
11:10:29,670 --> 11:10:29,970
Alright.

18673
11:10:30,250 --> 11:10:31,910
You got the bye bye in?

18674
11:10:31,970 --> 11:10:32,750
I haven't yet.

18675
11:10:32,870 --> 11:10:33,170
Alright.

18676
11:10:33,410 --> 11:10:34,750
I'm ending stream.

18677
11:10:34,830 --> 11:10:35,630
Bye bye.

18678
11:10:36,690 --> 11:10:37,130
Okay.

18679
11:10:37,290 --> 11:10:38,770
I'm making my waiting room.

18680
11:10:38,770 --> 11:10:42,610
I'm making my waiting room so my thing is still up.

18681
11:10:43,110 --> 11:10:44,390
I'm waiting.

18682
11:10:45,230 --> 11:10:47,870
I'm waiting for it to work.

18683
11:10:50,670 --> 11:10:51,090
Redirect.

11:10:51,330 --> 11:10:52,290
Let me redirect.

18685
11:10:52,790 --> 11:10:55,070
Please let me redirect.

18686
11:10:56,810 --> 11:10:58,010
It doesn't...

18687
11:10:58,010 --> 11:11:00,570
It doesn't exist yet.

18688
11:11:00,810 --> 11:11:01,970
It doesn't exist.

18689
11:11:04,550 --> 11:11:05,690
What time?

18690
11:11:05,690 --> 11:11:07,470
I have my bed down.

18691
11:11:08,230 --> 11:11:08,670
Alright.

18692
11:11:08,990 --> 11:11:11,670
