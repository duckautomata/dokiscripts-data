00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,820
We're jumping right into it.

19
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:45,600
You guys missed out the saddest deer limping I've ever seen.

20
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,140
It was so sad.

21
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:49,200

22
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:49,820
It's great.

23
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:53,000
Anyway, should we all introduce ourselves?

24
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:55,060
Like before.

25
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,460
Instead of being like, who the fuck are these people right
now?

26
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,120
Just a bunch of people yelling, no big deal.

27
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,360
No big deal, no big deal.

28
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:05,580
Who wants to go first?

29
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:06,920
Who wants to go first?

30
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:10,320
I'll go, I'll go, I'll go.

31
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,200
No one was gonna say anything.

32

We are all dead, we're all dead.

191
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:09,260

What's up?

203
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,140
You've never seen a deer stand on two feet.

204
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,080
Oh my god.

205
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,860

00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,580
Holy shit.

209
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,200

00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,800

211
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,420

00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:29,000
You'll never know who it is.

220
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,060
Oh, oh.

221
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,340
Why am I first person?

222
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,400
This is the worst.

223
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:34,580
Whoa.

224
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:36,700

230
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,640
I'm tickling your toes, I'm tickling your toes!

Oh yeah, sorry, we forgot to introduce ourselves again.

234
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,720
We're all so distracted.

235
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:38,560
by the deer.

236
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,340
The only person that's been introduced is Have Mercy Daddy.

237
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,200
Yeah, yeah.

238
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:43,380
Have Mercy Daddy.

239
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,360
I'm not even honored.

240
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:45,840
Oh my god.

241
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,940
He killed all the skin walkers.

242
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:50,600
Oh god.

243
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,740
Alright, alright.

244
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,940
Before we start shooting, let's introduce ourselves.

245
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,040
Let's introduce ourselves.

246
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,360

247
00:09:58,780 --> 00:09:59,700
Hello, it's me.

248
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:02,980
Have Mercy Daddy, aka Omelie.

249
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:03,720
Hello, hello.

250
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,740

Wait, who has the gun now?

256
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,520
Not me.

257
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,980
I think it's fruit.

258
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,320
No.

259
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,680
Yeah, yeah, it is.

260
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:45,980
I think.

261
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:51,700
All right, fruit, since you have the gun and could kill us
at any moment, who are you?

262
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,120
Yeah, I totally have a gun.

263
00:10:55,240 --> 00:11:00,820
Hello, I'm Avricad, also known as fruit, and I am a
part-time frog.

264
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:02,720
Part-time frog?

265
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,860
When did you become a frog?

266
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:07,840
Since I could go...

267
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,380
That's why she's part-time.

268
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,200
She's still interning right now under the frog ship.

269
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:22,480
I'm an intern.

270
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,260
I'm a frog intern.

271
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,840
Frog intern.

272
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:28,560
All right.

273
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:29,380

277
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:35,840

286
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:02,620
Did you hear about the cowboy with dietary restrictions?

287
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:05,680

Oh, my God.

Guys, rebuke me.

299
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,100
Please, I'm lifting him in the bush.

00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:56,540
Get in the bush.

301
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,620
I'm in the bush.

302
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:01,880
Get in the bush.

303
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:02,320
I'm in the bush.

304
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,300
Look, look.

305
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,920
Statue to the bush!

306
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:10,300
I'm okay!

307
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:10,920
You can't aim in bushes!

308
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:13,460
I'm okay!

309
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:14,600

310
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:15,000
Wait, wait!

311
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:18,340

Oh my god!

315
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,000
Oh my god!

316
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,480
Oh no!

317
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:29,940
Oh no!

318
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,340
I'm not okay!

319
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:33,460
Wait, did you die?

320
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:34,420
I don't know!

321
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,800
I'm still alive, but I'm not okay!

322
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,620
Why is this scary music?

323
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:42,780
What is happening?

324
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,360
What is happening?

325
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:48,440
Yeah, stupid!

326
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:52,260
Oh, that's like full insanity I get now.

327
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:54,840
Oh, hunter insanity.

328
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,160
I was like, what's that countdown?

329
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,200
What's the deer in my ears?

330
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:03,420
Oh, if you don't kill the deer fast enough, the deer become
sentient.

331
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:04,980
That's right.

332
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,420
The deer evolves.

333
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:07,920
The other deer?

334
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:12,100
We're gonna grab your gun and we're gonna shoot you.

335
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,440
That's right.

336
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,240
Oh, let's see.

337
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,020
True story.

338
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,980
Oh, fruit's the hunting.

339
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:21,700
Fruit's the hair.

340
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:23,060
Yeah, it ends up talking.

341
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,240
You know what?

342
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:27,660
I hate more than deer on this place.

343
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,020
What do you hate more than deer?

344
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,640
It could be any of us, fruit.

345
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,800
We could be right behind you right now.

346
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:40,820
And it's the scariest thing I've ever heard in my life.

347
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,800
We could be right to your left.

348
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,560
Are you following me?

349
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:49,000
That could be us.

350
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,200
Right now.

351
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:53,980
I could be right there.

352
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,200
Oh my god.

353
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:59,700
Holy crap.

354
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,880
This is scarier than lethal company.

355
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:06,780
Who's the app?

356
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:07,780
Who's here?

357
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,100
And who's the imposter?

358
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,560
I wonder if I can fix my FOV.

359
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,180
Oh, no, don't know.

360
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,780
There's no FOV settings.

361
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:15,780
I checked.

362
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:16,360
There's no...

363
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:19,460
You think this game has FOV settings?

364
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,500
This game has like...

365
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,120
Oh, shit.

366
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:23,900
You died?

367
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,180
Oh, no.

368
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:26,860
Don't worry.

369
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,360
I tried to rush her.

Like, we're...

546
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:01,460
Oh.

547
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,460
That's what the crouch button is for.

548
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:05,860
That's why there's so many trees and bushes.

549
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,780
Oh, yeah, there's a crouch button.

550
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:08,360
Yeah, yeah.

551
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,640
Wait, it is.

552
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,520
We have to hide behind him.

553
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,700
We're being paranoid.

554
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:17,160
I see a deer across the forest just crouching.

555
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:19,240
What the fuck is that?

556
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,600
I wonder who that could be.

557
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,780
Like, look across the forest.

558
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,320
Look across.

559
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,220
You might see me.

560
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:26,620
Turn around.

561
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,280
I see you crouch spamming.

562
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,780
Oh no, that's that's that must be fruit.

563
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:33,420
Yeah.

564
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,860
It's like a tea bag.

565
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,720
Must be nice knowing where the deer are.

566
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:41,640
Yeah, like be nice.

567
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,760
I mean, just give us the coordinates.

568
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:45,200
Wait, I see.

569
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:46,480
Okay, wait, that's you.

570
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,040
Dude, I can't even give you the coordinates if I wanted to.

571
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,720
Who the fuck is he?

572
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:54,240
One of us will find him.

573
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:54,440
Oh, sweet.

574
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,580
You're going to find him.

575
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:56,400
How close are you?

576
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,000
No, you see, look in the sky.

577
00:24:58,540 --> 00:24:59,280
Look, look.

578
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:06,120

581
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:31,800
to prove it oh i see a orange jacket.

582
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:36,960
You're aiming right down to the west.

583
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:39,320
We see you, son.

584
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:41,040
I actually don't like that.

585
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,440
I don't like that.

586
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:43,280
I don't like it.

587
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:44,620
Why are you running?

588
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:49,100
Why are you running, son?

589
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:51,940
Wait a second.

590
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:52,660
Hold on.

591
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:56,180
Oh, what are you doing?

592
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,280
Oh, I see you.

593
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,420
You're looking to the right.

594
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:03,060
You're looking see if the sound effects were the same as a
deer running.

595
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:08,760
Like if I ran, if they're the same sounds as deer running.

596
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:10,580
What are you running to the right?

597
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,560
I don't like this game.

598
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,780
We could be anywhere.

599
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,200
We could be in front of you.

600
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,600
We could be behind you.

601
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,640
You know what's the worst part?

602
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:23,560
You know what's the worst part?

603
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:28,860
There's like a radius around me that is clearly that thing
you guys are talking about.

604
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:43,620
You can see in like it when i zoom in it blocks out some of
the stuff so i can't even see oh oh my god he oh my god i'm

605
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:50,420

circle

00:26:55,700 --> 00:27:01,700
that's so we can come back Oh, wait, I respawned.

607
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:04,800
Yeah, you can't kill us forever.

608
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:09,520
We come back.

609
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,420
These deer are fucking crazy.

610
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,400
Oh, don't keep moving.

611
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,560
No, we can be in front of you.

612
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:18,640
You don't know that.

613
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,860
I already be right next to you in a bush.

614
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,120
Yeah, get in a circle, get in a circle!

615
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:24,620
Get in a circle!

616
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:29,680
Oh, I sneaked right there.

617
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:30,400
right in.

618
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,860
Oh, don't you?

619
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,180
Yeah, that's right.

620
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,200
You don't give a terrible shot.

621
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:36,280
That's right.

622
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:38,140
You don't know where we are now.

623
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:40,180
My chance, like, five nights in the forest.

624
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:44,720
We're right behind you.

625
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:45,780
Oh, God.

626
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:47,900
That's terrifying.

627
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:53,100
Oh, you sigh.

628
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,460
I don't like this game anymore.

629
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:14,340
you it's like the slender meant the eight pages collected
eight pages maybe if i get high ground where is he oh no

slightly paranoid

632
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:32,360
Yeah, man, I killed that shit.

633
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:33,940
You feel an anxious, you feel an anxious.

634
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:38,120
To be fair, the first half of this was us figuring out how
to play.

635
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:39,080
Yeah, true.

636
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,880
Don't worry, guys.

637
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:41,800
If I'm a...

638
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,000
Okay, I know how to troll.

639
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:43,620
I'm here.

640
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:44,580
Oh.

641
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:45,520
I know what I'm doing.

642
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:46,940
You know what the...

643
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:47,820
Yep.

644
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,060
Sight looks like.

645
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:49,600
Yeah.

646
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:50,700
Yeah, now we know.

647
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,080
Okay, guys.

648
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:52,760
Okay.

649
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:53,740
Hey, guys.

650
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:54,820
I'm in my gamer chair.

651
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,620
I'm in my gamer chair.

652
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:57,760
I'm in my gamer position.

653
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,920
Did you put your glasses on?

654
00:28:58,980 --> 00:28:59,260

I'm

661
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,060
locked!

662
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:13,480
You're locked in!

663
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:14,840
You're locked in!

664
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:16,280
You're locked in!

665
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,040
You're locked in!

666
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:19,620
You can't do all this!

667
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:22,020
She's going to send it!

668
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:26,280
Kill me!

669
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:28,120
Guys, don't worry!

670
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,940
She can't aim right here!

671
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:34,440
Oh, the hunter in Sanity respects whenever they Kill a deer.

672
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,460
Guys, we worked so hard, guys.

673
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,320
We had to die now.

674
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,680
I see now.

675
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,100
Oh, I fixed it.

676
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:43,720
I fixed it.

677
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,400
I fixed it.

678
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:45,220
We figured this out.

679
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:46,080
She just turned to me.

680
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:46,640
Holy crap.

681
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:49,480
Guys, we worked so hard getting that meter up, guys.

682
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:51,220
We have to be more stealthy.

683
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:54,180
Believe.

684
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:55,760
So this really is a stealth game.

685
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:56,820
Where are you guys?

686
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:57,480
Come out.

687
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,320
Come out wherever you are.

688
00:30:59,540 --> 00:30:59,820
Please.

689
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:00,360
Please.

690
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,220
I have a family.

691
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,160
I have a family of deers.

692
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:03,540
Please.

693
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:12,460
You wouldn't kill the father of Bambi now, would you?

694
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,220
Oh, I 100% would.

695
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,840
He's an asshole.

696
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:21,000
What do you mean?

697
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:23,080
Have you not seen Bambi, too?

698
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:26,300
I think I'm like the one person that saw Bambi too.

699
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:33,540
I am one of those people that watch Bambi too.

700
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,600
Are you running?

701
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:35,980
Are you running?

702
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:39,200
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, I'm gonna run in a circle!

703
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:40,240
Serpentine!

704
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:41,060
Serpentine!

705
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,260
Oh, it's working!

706
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,060
They can't see me.

707
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:44,440
They can't see me.

708
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:46,360
What am I, a Gator?

709
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:47,180
Oh, shit!

710
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:48,560
Wait, where are you here?

711
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:51,760
Oh, it would be great to have faked these on this map.

712
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:54,240
Yeah, but there's lots of bushes, though.

713
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:55,700
Mushes.

714
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,780
We have the bushes for cover.

715
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:59,340
I think we might have glitched the Hunter and Jami.

716
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:00,000
No!

717
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,720
No, it lost us the points!

718
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:05,760
Holy shit.

719
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:06,940
This one's harder.

720
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,900
The reset is hard.

721
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,510
Why are you hiding in that bush, Monarch?

722
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,480
But then if we all hide in bushes, she can't see us.

723
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,760
The hunter becomes the hunted.

724
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,160

00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:02,800
This is not an amateur.

746
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:05,420

the circle all in the open just No, she ran past me.

751
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:39,720
She ran past me, so I got a little bit.

752
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:41,540
We're just helpless little deer.

753
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:43,020
We're just helpless little deer.

754
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,480
We're helpless little deer.

755
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:47,180
We just want to talk.

756
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,680

That one is hard.

761
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:07,720
Wait, why is the insanity going up?

762
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:09,320
We're not even fucking playing the game.

763
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:09,980
Did we spawn?

764
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:16,740
I was just thinking, like one of us spawned into the circle
in the loading scene.

765
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:18,640
I was locked in, baby.

766
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:22,740
What?

767
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:24,080
I'm the killer again?

768
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,440
Alright, alright, alright.

769
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,600
We just want to talk.

770
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,120
We just want to talk.

771
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,160

Yeah, it's F.

775
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,520
I'm glitched in the grass.

776
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:36,740
This is it.

777
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,980
This is our chance guys.

778
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:38,600
This is it.

779
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:39,700
She's glitched.

780
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:40,700
We could win.

781
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:41,320
We could win.

782
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:45,640
Go go go go go She's stuck Go go go.

783
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,120

Oh, I see her.

785
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:48,940
Don't you worry.

786
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:58,540
My stream froze once I get on the other computer Oh, yes,

794
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:36,800
We'll lose our points!

795
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:38,560
The sand!

796
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:39,220
The grass!

797
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,460
We're so close!

798
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,520
Wait, we can't like climb up!

799
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:43,740

801
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:45,680
Don't die!

802
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:46,700
Our points!

803
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,260
Just hide in the grass!

804
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:51,600
Just hide in the grass!

805
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,400
I gotta go to Candy Mountain!

806
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:56,500
Come on, boy!

807
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:57,620
The water's so loud!

808
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,440
Dude, the water is extreme!

809
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:03,280
Extremely loud That's it.

810
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:04,880
That takes her more parents.

811
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,640
Where am I?

812
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:10,300
Where am I now?

813
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,200
We almost got this!

814
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:27,340
You should have got the wild grass when you had the chance
You better run.

815
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:32,020
Yes, right So wait, what happened?

816
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,600
I was like a foot tall.

817
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,600
I was like an ant.

818
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,200
She couldn't see past the wild grass.

819
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:38,620
You know what I'm doing?

820
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:39,820
An animated movie?

821
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:42,340
Oh, when you lost?

822
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,400
No, that whole time.

823
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:44,940
The whole game.

824
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:48,600
Yeah, because she was so, she was too short for the tall
grass.

825
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:49,900
You know, like in Pokemon?

826
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:51,180
Like, what?

827
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:55,800
Well, it looks like it's my turn, fellas.

828
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,280
Oh, your turn.

829
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:58,680
Where is he?

830
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:00,380
Oh, he's over there.

831
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:01,320
Oh, it's daytime.

832
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:02,360
That's cheating.

833
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,240
You get the sun to your advantage.

834
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,660
I gotta find me in open field.

835
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:10,020
Oh, no.

836
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:12,780
Don't let him get the open field.

837
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:15,220
I hear you.

838
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:16,460
Well, yeah, you do.

839
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,280
In the bushes.

840
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:20,420
Yeah, you hear definitely hear me in the bushes.

841
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:21,580
I have an idea.

842
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:25,500
You're still not in the open field.

843
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:26,440
I'm trying.

844
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,820
Oh, I know you're here.

845
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:30,120
Oh, no, you don't.

846
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:30,960
Yeah.

847
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,600
No, you don't.

848
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:35,260
I know you're in when I hear the timer.

849
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,720
When you hear the timer.

850
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:40,040
Don't worry.

851
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:43,500
There's bushes all around you.

852
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,940
How did you see the force wheel?

853
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:49,200
Yes, walk.

854
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:52,260
I didn't see it.

855
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,700
I was like, where did he go?

856
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,340
Also, it didn't reset.

857
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:56,160
So...

858
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,340
Oh, that was a bug on the other map.

859
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,440
Clearly, I just...

860
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:01,940
Early Axis.

861
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:04,260
I mean, this is pretty good for an early Axis.

862
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:04,980
You hear that?

863
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,460
You hear that?

864
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,400
Oh yeah, it works now.

865
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:18,080
Yeah, that's right.

866
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,060
You capped 360.

867
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:24,180
They made it so much easier for you guys.

868
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:26,460
You can't say that!

869
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:28,160
I'm gonna fuck yours up!

870
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,520
You can't say that!

871
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:42,600
I can't you be more like I'm a Liza Whoa Wait, I'm stuck
Wait, no, wait, it's a dead end Oh, she was dead end This is

872
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,740

873
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:45,180
Why me?

874
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:57,640
I just got here Oh no, we died too many times it resets Oh

875
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:02,120
the consequences of our own This round We can get it back
up.

876
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:03,580
You can.

877
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,240
Oh, this is like a...

878
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:05,920
That's right.

879
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:06,440
That's right.

880
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:07,320
Try and shoot this.

881
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:08,440
You can't leave this.

882
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:09,180
This is an invisible wall.

883
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,140
You can't leave this.

884
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:11,480
I'm out of ammo.

885
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:11,760
Oh, you are?

886
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:12,560
He's reloading.

887
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,400
He's reloading!

888
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,160
He's reloading!

889
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:19,700
Out of ammo, we go in for the kill.

890
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:25,760
I'm a Halo player, not an Apex player.

891
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,160
It's okay.

892
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,200
He can't shoot the tree.

893
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,360
Just like last time.

894
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:32,040
Battle divers!

895
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,280
Oh no!

896
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,280
For democracy.

897
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:37,860
We're still in here.

898
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,640
But you don't know where.

899
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,460
Yeah, where could we be, I wonder.

900
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,100
Oh, where could we be?

901
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:44,780
What?

902
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:50,100
You're lucky I had to reload, you damn.

903
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:51,320
Sure.

904
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,480
Shall I find an issue?

905
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:58,720
It's okay.

906
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:01,680
For democracy, you of a bitch.

907
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:02,710
Tick tock.

00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:05,480
Yeah, yeah, you're still in here, huh?

909
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:07,840
It's like playing dodgeball.

910
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,760
I've always been in here.

911
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:12,060
If you can dodge a bullet, you can dodge a ball.

912
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:14,200
What do I look like?

913
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,100
Wait, don't shoot me, but what do I look like?

914
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:18,240
What the frick is happening to me?

915
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:20,620
Is her neck all twisted?

916
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:26,700

922
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:03,820
You're right.

923
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:05,200
This is a dictatorship.

924
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:07,480
No.

925
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:08,360
Oh, damn.

927
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:18,160
Maybe that jumped in the air over there.

928
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:18,420
No!

929
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:21,620
Can't catch me at 360!

930
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:23,540
Oh dear!

931
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,380
I took you right.

932
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:27,160
That's right!

933
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:28,180
You ran out of ammo!

934
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:28,980

00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:03,100
I'm stuck.

940
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:04,720
I'm stuck.

941
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,820
What was going on here?

942
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:10,100
You'll never know.

943
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:13,700
That's right.

944
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:15,420
You in the wrong territory.

945
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:17,440
What happened to my body?

946
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:21,740
I'm in the wrong negative woods now.

947
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:23,240
Yeah, that's right.

948
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,420
I was thinking right.

949
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:29,680
Get out of here.

950
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:31,060

No!

953
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:35,860
You some bitch.

954
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:38,660
I got one of you.

955
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:40,160
Oh, you did it.

956
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:41,860
Well, you missed.

957
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:45,860
Yeah, that's for Bambi!

958
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:46,900
I'm going up the map!

959
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,420

00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:53,940
That's for Bambi!

962
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:56,720
Chat, they're cheating!

963
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,100
We can't talk grasshopper.

964
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:00,200
You literally won.

965
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:02,420
I still won.

966
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:03,440
I still won.

967
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:04,240
No!

968
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:07,620
I'll never give you.

969
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:09,160
I found out Ping is the thing.

970
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:12,580
Bro, on my end, I literally was under the map.

971
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:14,120
I'm like, what's going on?

972
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,480
He like disappeared from me.

973
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:17,760
I was like, where did he go?

974
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:23,220
Oh, I think the night maps are the scariest.

975
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:25,540
Yeah, for sure.

976
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:27,280
It's gonna make me the hunter.

977
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:29,960
I wonder what the what?

978
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:39,240
no what did you say oh i wonder what the proximity chat
sounds like like is it just the deer running by like the

979
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:45,840
funny thing is it's like one of those things where i like
looked and there's no way to pick what microphone to use in

980
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:52,500
the game unless you have to do it specifically in your
settings i can't see i can't see anything i can't see

Text.

996
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:17,040
Proximity chat.

997
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:17,840

There's a chance.

1016
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:13,880
What are you spawning at the edge of the fucking map?

1017
00:46:14,180 --> 00:46:16,620
I can't, I can't like ADS anymore.

00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:18,220
You can't ADS.

What?

1024
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,120
Water is so loud.

1025
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:29,560
That's why we need to take her to the water.

1026

only chance when you take her into the water all right push

Try, um...

1041
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:50,820
What worked for me was zooming in and out, like, using the
scope again.

1042
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,720
I was like, what's in this bush?

1043
00:47:56,780 --> 00:47:57,880

At Apex Legends.

00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:30,880
You're going to open field?

00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:32,360
What is this?

1050
00:48:33,860 --> 00:48:35,960
What is this?

1051
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:38,660
You're in the fucking corner.

1052
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:41,400
I just hear the shots.

1053
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:43,840
I'm like 200 meters away.

1054
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:47,480
I'm within all these bushes.

1055
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:49,480
Wish is the right bush.

1056
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:50,760
Whoa.

1057
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:53,580
Fruit, what are you doing?

00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:55,220
I don't know.

1059
00:48:55,420 --> 00:48:57,240
I'm so paranoid right now.

1060
00:48:57,300 --> 00:48:58,000
I'm so scared.

1061
00:48:58,120 --> 00:48:58,560
I'm so scared.

1062
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:01,480
Hey, how's it going, pal?

1063
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:04,660
How's it going, pal?

1064
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:06,180
Wait, I'm stuck.

1065
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:08,100
Oh my god, my W key doesn't work.

1066
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:08,540
That's it?

1067
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:09,820
She's stuck.

1068
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:11,640
We got this.

1069
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:12,820
You lied.

1070
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:13,940
You lied to me.

1071
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:15,160
I didn't even do anything.

1072
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:17,200
Hey, I don't need a W key to shoot.

1073
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:19,180
Damn, that's crazy.

1074
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:21,960
I was just watching your back.

1075
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:24,120
And this is the thanks I get.

1076
00:49:24,740 --> 00:49:26,080
I'm gonna reload.

1077
00:49:26,780 --> 00:49:28,620
You're jumping in so funny.

1078
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:32,020
You're jumping in the funniest looking thing.

1079
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:34,940
Come on, fruit.

1080
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:36,340
Don't do this.

1081
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:38,060
This is not like your fruit.

1082
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:41,080
You wouldn't kill a deer, would you?

1083
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:44,700
You wouldn't kill a deer with glasses, would you?

1084
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:48,220
You wouldn't download a deer, would you?

1085
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:49,140
Oh my god, my god.

1086
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:52,560
Wait, I died and my scope is perma- I'm perma-scope dead.

1087
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:55,020
I'm perma- God damn it.

1088
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:55,740
No!

1089
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:56,860
We're so close!

1090
00:49:57,860 --> 00:49:59,280
We're so close!

1091
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:00,700
The scent is alive!

1092
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:02,200
That's lucky, right?

1093
00:50:02,980 --> 00:50:04,020
She doesn't know.

1094
00:50:04,260 --> 00:50:04,500
Oh, wait.

1095
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:06,580
She doesn't know.

1096
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:10,140
Oh, no, don't walk away from the bushes.

1097
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:10,820
Come on.

1098
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:11,820
Fruit doesn't know.

1099
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:12,360
You don't know.

1100
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:13,520
I don't know.

1101
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:14,720
Come on, we're just...

1102
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:15,420
Wait, I don't.

1103
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:16,200
I'm stupid.

1104
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:16,960
We're just shit.

1105
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:27,440
Every time we get close, she shames us.

1106
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:31,880
That's right.

1107
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:32,760
That's like you're right.

1108
00:50:33,020 --> 00:50:33,560
Back into the bushes.

1109
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:34,080
I go.

1110
00:50:35,020 --> 00:50:35,340
No!

1111
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:37,200
Wait, I found them.

1112
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:38,020
Yeah, yeah.

1113
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:42,880
Yeah, the closest we got was getting Amalie crazy.

1114
00:50:43,180 --> 00:50:45,040
That's the closest we ever got.

1115
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:52,080
Will I ever get to be the hunter?

1116
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:54,120
Have you ever been?

1117
00:50:54,140 --> 00:50:56,360
No, I've been zero times.

1118
00:50:56,540 --> 00:50:58,600
I've never got chance to be a hunter.

1119
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:00,780
It really hates you.

1120
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:02,480
Can the host not be the hunter?

1121
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:03,320
I don't know.

1122
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:03,760
Maybe.

1123
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:05,180
Maybe that's why.

1124
00:51:05,780 --> 00:51:07,260
That would make a lot of sense.

1125
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:08,320
I say as I'm the hunter.

1126
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:09,580
I'm the hunter now.

1127
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:11,200
All right, fellas.

1128
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:14,020
I'm going to bully the shit out of Doki Bird.

1129
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:14,800
Let's go.

1130
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:17,600
Oh, my God.

1131
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:19,780
Bro, the flash like fucking sucks.

1132
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:20,980

00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:22,260
Yeah, it's so bad.

1134
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:23,680
It's so bright.

1135
00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:25,980
Oh, hey, deer and headlikes?

1136
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:26,400

1137
00:51:27,140 --> 00:51:30,820
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, no, I understand
now.

1138
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:37,480

1253
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:56,560
Two is my limit.

1254
00:56:57,360 --> 00:56:59,340
Ah, fellas, I don't think we're gonna be able to do it.

1255
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:00,160
Yeah, that's true.

1256

1432
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:13,580
The game looks like...

1433
01:05:13,580 --> 01:05:15,440
The skin looks really graphic.

1434
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:15,880

Where could the hunter be?

1463
01:06:57,660 --> 01:06:58,360
Who's the hunter?

1464
01:06:58,360 --> 01:06:58,700

1465
01:06:59,180 --> 01:07:00,680

Oh, no, you can't hide from that tree.

01:07:10,660 --> 01:07:11,900
You can't hide from that tree.

1470

Don't let her near me.

1474
01:07:19,420 --> 01:07:20,260
She doesn't know where I am.

1475
01:07:20,540 --> 01:07:22,140
She doesn't know where my body is.

1476
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:23,080

01:07:24,560 --> 01:07:25,040

Please.

1481
01:07:29,140 --> 01:07:30,360
She's not getting near my body.

1482
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:31,360
She can't get the point.

1483
01:07:31,980 --> 01:07:33,180
Don't let her get that point.

1484
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:34,180
Don't let her get close to me.

1485
01:07:34,180 --> 01:07:35,400
Don't let her touch me.

1486
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:36,320
Don't let her.

1487
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:41,320
Zero point for you.

01:12:57,200 --> 01:12:57,400
Oh, we did it!

1606
01:12:57,460 --> 01:12:57,880
Oh, so close!

1607
01:12:58,020 --> 01:13:00,540
My skin would have been peeled off, but I'm...

1608
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:01,240
I won.

1609
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:02,820
I was so close.

1610
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:05,580
You can't catch us all through it.

1611
01:13:05,680 --> 01:13:05,980
You could.

1612
01:13:06,160 --> 01:13:07,620
I figured out the game too late.

1613
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:12,080
Go to one too if it weren't for you.

1614
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:14,920
You could just jump over my head.

1615
01:13:17,100 --> 01:13:18,200
That's the strat.

1616
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:21,280
That's, oh no, not the night map.

1617
01:13:23,300 --> 01:13:24,780
Not the night map.

1618
01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:26,160
Not at night time.

1619
01:13:26,160 --> 01:13:27,560
I don't want to be hunter.

1620
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:28,480
Oh, thank God.

1621
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:30,500

1628
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:06,120
It won't let me.

1629
01:14:06,240 --> 01:14:06,640
Oh, there we go.

1630
01:14:07,020 --> 01:14:07,200
Oh, no!

1631
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:08,160
Look at that.

1632
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:09,480
My beautiful skin.

1633
01:14:10,440 --> 01:14:13,540
I have a very long skin routine.

1634
01:14:14,060 --> 01:14:14,880
You ruined it.

1635
01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:15,880
Your beautiful coat.

1636
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:16,400
No.

1637
01:14:16,780 --> 01:14:18,380
Yeah, your beautiful coat.

1638
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:20,180
I will avenge you.

1639
01:14:20,580 --> 01:14:23,320
Will I make a pretty coat?

1640
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:24,600
Will I...

1641
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:27,040
Thanks for your flesh.

1642
01:14:27,380 --> 01:14:27,720
Ah, fuck that.

1643
01:14:27,740 --> 01:14:28,360
That was so close.

1644
01:14:28,420 --> 01:14:29,600
You almost saved me.

1645
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:31,340
See him.

1646
01:14:31,340 --> 01:14:31,720
Don't worry.

1647
01:14:32,940 --> 01:14:33,760
I'm coming over.

1648
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:33,840
I'm coming over.

1649
01:14:34,100 --> 01:14:34,660
We don't have any points.

1650
01:14:34,780 --> 01:14:35,440
We don't have any points.

1651
01:14:35,620 --> 01:14:36,400
We got up on game.

1652
01:14:36,420 --> 01:14:36,860
Get him.

1653
01:14:37,080 --> 01:14:37,220
Get him.

1654
01:14:37,220 --> 01:14:37,620
That's right.

1655
01:14:37,620 --> 01:14:38,040
Dingle!

1656
01:14:39,580 --> 01:14:42,920
Guys, I got us some points, but not for us.

1657
01:14:42,940 --> 01:14:43,580
You tried.

1658
01:14:43,780 --> 01:14:44,260
You tried.

1659
01:14:44,440 --> 01:14:46,380
Get on the ground and let me skin you.

1660
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:47,880
No!

1661
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:51,500
I didn't get us the points.

1662
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:53,360
I got a single point.

1663
01:14:53,700 --> 01:14:54,600
We did it.

1664
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:56,200
You're the clutch.

1665
01:14:57,440 --> 01:14:58,560
I'm not dancing shit.

1666
01:14:58,940 --> 01:15:00,540
The blue does not help, fellas.

1667
01:15:01,160 --> 01:15:01,860
That's great.

1668
01:15:02,460 --> 01:15:04,080
My Zoom does not work anymore.

1669
01:15:04,980 --> 01:15:05,340
That's right.

1670
01:15:05,460 --> 01:15:07,540
You got the fruit nerf.

1671
01:15:08,680 --> 01:15:09,200
I sure did.

1672
01:15:10,020 --> 01:15:11,680
That's like we're no scoping everything.

1673
01:15:11,980 --> 01:15:14,160
Gotta get higher at all.

1674
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:14,860
Never mind.

1675
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:15,820
My Zoom works now.

1676
01:15:17,300 --> 01:15:18,020
Oh my god.

1677
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:18,640
Where is he?

1678
01:15:18,760 --> 01:15:19,600
We gotta beat him up.

1679
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:20,140
Beat him up.

1680
01:15:22,140 --> 01:15:23,940
My camera doesn't work, by the way.

1681
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:24,920
So I need to jump.

1682
01:15:26,160 --> 01:15:27,280
That jumps shot.

1683
01:15:27,460 --> 01:15:28,260
See, it's okay.

1684
01:15:28,420 --> 01:15:29,180
Don't let him near me.

1685
01:15:29,340 --> 01:15:30,460
Don't let him near me, guys.

1686
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:32,420
Don't let him near me!

1687
01:15:32,420 --> 01:15:33,040
Someone hit him!

1688
01:15:34,290 --> 01:15:34,700
No!

1689
01:15:35,500 --> 01:15:36,960
Get out!

1690
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:39,480
You some bitch!

1691
01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:43,260
We wouldn't let him near me!

1692
01:15:44,120 --> 01:15:45,560
Get him away from me!

1693
01:15:46,160 --> 01:15:47,020
He's gonna do it!

1694
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:49,780
Get off of me!

1695
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:51,200
Get off of me!

1696
01:15:51,200 --> 01:15:52,340
Get off of me, you bastards!

1697
01:15:53,140 --> 01:15:53,740
Get off!

1698
01:15:54,020 --> 01:15:58,900
I can't believe you fucking disgusting deer!

1699
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:00,880
Dude.

1700
01:16:01,380 --> 01:16:02,280
Yeah, that's right.

1701
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:04,540
Deer together strong.

1702
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:09,180
And this is some great age bullshit.

1703
01:16:09,740 --> 01:16:10,260
Oh, no!

1704
01:16:11,480 --> 01:16:17,740
Okay, guys, I realized running straight on it was not the
right idea.

1705
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:19,760
You got a bob and a weave.

1706
01:16:20,340 --> 01:16:20,380
You got a bob and a weave.

1707
01:16:20,380 --> 01:16:20,920
I didn't.

1708
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:24,440
I didn't really bob and weave.

1709
01:16:24,920 --> 01:16:28,180
This map, guys, I think this map might suck as a hundred.

1710
01:16:29,500 --> 01:16:30,880
Wait, Really?

1711
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:35,040
No way.

1712
01:16:36,120 --> 01:16:37,160
The insta skin?

1713
01:16:37,320 --> 01:16:38,060
Oh my god.

1714
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:41,140
The night map is bad for the hunter?

1715
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:42,860
No fucking way.

1716
01:16:44,340 --> 01:16:45,400
Who would have thought?

1717
01:16:45,980 --> 01:16:46,800
Who would have thought?

1718
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:48,860
Who would have thought?

1719
01:16:49,740 --> 01:16:49,820
The bob and weave.

1720
01:16:51,940 --> 01:16:54,280
The bob and weave is pissing me off.

1721
01:16:54,820 --> 01:16:55,740
Bob and weave.

1722
01:16:56,140 --> 01:16:56,420
Whoa!

1723
01:16:57,440 --> 01:16:58,140
That's it!

1724
01:16:59,680 --> 01:17:00,400
That's it.

1725
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:02,000
That was actually fucking hilarious.

1726
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:03,300
What are you guys doing?

1727
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:06,700
It's upsetting me!

1728
01:17:08,940 --> 01:17:10,280
There's no more stealth.

1729
01:17:10,540 --> 01:17:12,040
It's just bobbing weave.

1730
01:17:13,940 --> 01:17:14,980
I'm scared.

1731
01:17:15,260 --> 01:17:15,960
I'm hungry.

1732
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:18,060
I just want my beer skin.

1733
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:19,660
You're at that four.

1734
01:17:19,820 --> 01:17:20,240
Don't you have enough?

1735
01:17:20,240 --> 01:17:21,160
No, no, it's not for you.

1736
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:24,880
It's four not enough for you.

1737
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:25,980
Get over the minute.

1738
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:27,320
No, fruit.

1739
01:17:28,020 --> 01:17:28,940
I'm not going to lie.

1740
01:17:29,140 --> 01:17:30,100

1781
01:20:56,520 --> 01:20:57,100
I'm in.

1782
01:20:57,720 --> 01:20:58,620
I got this, gamers.

1783
01:20:58,980 --> 01:20:59,220
Don't worry.

1784
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:02,160
but then they fucked up.

1785
01:21:03,300 --> 01:21:03,840
Oh, man.

1786
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:05,120
On the first one!

1787
01:21:05,620 --> 01:21:08,020
I'm more important than all of you because I'm the first
one.

1788
01:21:08,180 --> 01:21:08,620
I got it.

1789
01:21:09,220 --> 01:21:11,840
You know, they say first is the worst, actually.

1790
01:21:12,060 --> 01:21:12,740
Yeah, well...

1791
01:21:12,740 --> 01:21:14,120
Second and third are better.

1792
01:21:14,740 --> 01:21:16,780
My atlas are bigger than yours.

1793
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:19,460
Yeah, you want to prove it?

1794
01:21:19,480 --> 01:21:22,540
Yeah, there's so much testosterone right now.

1795
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:24,520
I'm getting so much.

1796
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:28,060
That's right.

1797
01:21:29,220 --> 01:21:30,120
Well, measure it.

1798
01:21:30,160 --> 01:21:32,160
You want to measure our antlers together.

1799
01:21:32,260 --> 01:21:35,120
I've got a huge pair of antlers right now.

1800
01:21:37,180 --> 01:21:40,520
My antlers are at least 10 inches.

1801
01:21:40,820 --> 01:21:41,160
Come on.

1802
01:21:44,360 --> 01:21:46,100
It's not about the size.

1803
01:21:46,280 --> 01:21:48,420
It's how you use your antlers, fellas.

1804
01:21:49,100 --> 01:21:50,120
Alright, alright.

1805
01:21:51,720 --> 01:21:54,920
It's the motion of the ocean, right, guys?

1806
01:21:55,380 --> 01:21:57,860
We can't even go in the ocean.

1807
01:21:58,500 --> 01:21:59,660

Oh my god.

01:23:01,220 --> 01:23:03,040
Wait, you're already insane?

1824
01:23:03,880 --> 01:23:05,840
Oh, I shot one deer accidentally.

1825
01:23:06,380 --> 01:23:07,480
You're going to go insane.

1826
01:23:07,980 --> 01:23:08,740
No, no, no.

1827
01:23:08,980 --> 01:23:10,260
Just no way.

1828
01:23:11,480 --> 01:23:13,040
Come on, I know what it's one of you.

1829
01:23:13,240 --> 01:23:13,460
What is the countdown for?

1830
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:15,080
I know one of you is the deer.

1831
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:16,700
I know one of you is not real.

1832
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:18,100
You're not real.

1833
01:23:19,060 --> 01:23:20,440
I took my meds today.

1834
01:23:20,520 --> 01:23:21,900
I know one of you is not real.

1835
01:23:24,060 --> 01:23:24,380
Is that...

1836
01:23:24,380 --> 01:23:24,960
Are you real?

1837
01:23:25,020 --> 01:23:26,180
Took your meds, you say.

1838
01:23:27,500 --> 01:23:28,760
Let's test that theory.

1839
01:23:30,140 --> 01:23:30,540
Oh, no.

1840
01:23:31,500 --> 01:23:32,860
Which one is it?

1841
01:23:33,580 --> 01:23:34,260
Which one is it?

1842
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:35,580
I was trapped in a room once.

1843
01:23:36,580 --> 01:23:37,440
Are you real?

1844
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:38,340
A room full of deer.

1845
01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:39,140
Are you a real deer?

1846
01:23:39,460 --> 01:23:40,420
You're a real deer.

1847
01:23:41,660 --> 01:23:42,260
Oh no.

1848
01:23:43,140 --> 01:23:43,800
Who's not?

1849
01:23:43,800 --> 01:23:44,380
Oh no.

1850
01:23:44,420 --> 01:23:45,540
It's not real.

1851
01:23:46,740 --> 01:23:48,780
I can see them in my wall.

1852
01:23:48,820 --> 01:23:49,380
How do you know?

1853
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:50,400
How do you know?

1854
01:23:50,420 --> 01:23:52,920
Everyone's a real deer until they're not.

1855
01:23:54,480 --> 01:23:55,160
How do you know?

1856
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:55,720
Crazy.

1857
01:23:56,180 --> 01:23:57,760
I was crazy once.

1858
01:23:58,360 --> 01:24:00,020
I was crazy once.

1859
01:24:02,040 --> 01:24:03,920
Let me out, let me out.

1860
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:05,940
Where even are you?

1861
01:24:06,780 --> 01:24:08,160
Grab the room full of deer.

1862
01:24:09,160 --> 01:24:10,000
You'll never know.

1863
01:24:10,260 --> 01:24:11,600
Oh my god, why are you following me?

1864
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:13,380
Why is this the other one?

1865
01:24:13,660 --> 01:24:14,980
Two deer is following me.

1866
01:24:16,260 --> 01:24:19,320
Oh, there's a lot of deer is following me right now.

1867
01:24:21,400 --> 01:24:21,920
Are you spooked?

1868
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:24,360
You know what?

1869
01:24:24,420 --> 01:24:26,120
I'm sick and tired of waiting.

1870
01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:27,180
Me too.

1871
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:27,900
Run!

1872
01:24:28,700 --> 01:24:29,260
Get her!

1873
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:31,060
Burn!

1874
01:24:34,900 --> 01:24:35,500
No!

1875
01:24:36,040 --> 01:24:37,240
I got rushed!

1876
01:24:37,800 --> 01:24:39,260
Someone call the evidence!

1877
01:24:41,940 --> 01:24:42,360
Oh no.

1878
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:43,300
Snake maneuver!

1879
01:24:46,100 --> 01:24:46,700
No!

1880
01:24:46,820 --> 01:24:47,840
I'm going to reload!

1881
01:24:49,700 --> 01:24:50,300
Help!

1882
01:24:50,840 --> 01:24:51,140
No.

1883
01:24:52,700 --> 01:24:53,720
Where did he go?

1884
01:24:54,540 --> 01:24:55,180
Where did he...

1885
01:24:55,180 --> 01:24:56,340
Where did he go?

1886
01:24:56,540 --> 01:24:57,060
There's no...

1887
01:24:57,060 --> 01:24:57,320
No!

1888
01:24:57,500 --> 01:24:58,460
That's not a real deal!

1889
01:24:58,520 --> 01:24:59,200
That's a real deal!

1890
01:25:03,080 --> 01:25:03,760
No!

1891
01:25:04,300 --> 01:25:04,980
No!

1892
01:25:08,300 --> 01:25:08,640
No!

1893
01:25:08,640 --> 01:25:08,760
No!

1894
01:25:08,760 --> 01:25:08,840
No!

1895
01:25:08,840 --> 01:25:09,340
Get away!

1896
01:25:09,560 --> 01:25:10,760
Get away!

1897
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:12,880
There's a few of them!

1898
01:25:13,500 --> 01:25:14,420
There's two of them!

1899
01:25:14,820 --> 01:25:15,300
There's a few of them!

1900
01:25:15,300 --> 01:25:15,760
What the?

1901
01:25:16,460 --> 01:25:17,580
Oh, fuck my ankles!

1902
01:25:19,420 --> 01:25:22,480
Oh, there's one left.

1903
01:25:22,820 --> 01:25:24,220
Oh my god!

1904
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:25,180
Oh, guys!

1905
01:25:26,200 --> 01:25:28,180
This isn't terrifying enough!

1906
01:25:28,700 --> 01:25:29,040
Really?

1907
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:36,560

real thing Bro It's like phasnophobia Yeah

1909
01:26:01,360 --> 01:26:04,780
I can't wait for the deer to appear in lethal company.

1910
01:26:05,700 --> 01:26:07,320
How tiny is your garden?

1911
01:26:07,880 --> 01:26:08,880
Now, hold up.

1912
01:26:09,180 --> 01:26:11,180
In lethal company, that actually would be terrifying.

1913
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:12,740
Just ahead of a deer.

1914
01:26:12,760 --> 01:26:14,600
Just ahead of a deer.

1915
01:26:15,500 --> 01:26:16,460
Chasing you down.

1916
01:26:16,720 --> 01:26:17,260
Locked in.

1917
01:26:17,560 --> 01:26:18,880
Oh my god.

1918
01:26:20,260 --> 01:26:21,420
I'm going to go insane.

1919
01:26:21,560 --> 01:26:22,780
This is an awful map.

1920
01:26:23,160 --> 01:26:23,640
Holy crap.

1921
01:26:25,040 --> 01:26:26,020
I really should.

1922
01:26:27,560 --> 01:26:30,240
You'll never know which one's the right one.

1923
01:26:31,560 --> 01:26:34,860
Which was the right deer?

1924
01:26:35,660 --> 01:26:40,020
Oh, which one is it?

1925
01:26:40,140 --> 01:26:41,800
Why are you staring at me?

1926
01:26:42,340 --> 01:26:43,300
That's why!

1927
01:26:43,640 --> 01:26:43,680
Yes!

1928
01:26:44,380 --> 01:26:44,380
No!

1929
01:26:44,760 --> 01:26:45,600
Don't get her!

1930
01:26:45,780 --> 01:26:46,720
I got stuck in the wood!

1931
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:51,700
Guys, I got stuck on a tree.

1932
01:26:51,960 --> 01:26:54,900
Where's me?

1933
01:26:55,180 --> 01:26:55,520
Where's me?

1934
01:26:56,100 --> 01:26:57,740
That's right, that's right, there's no way he doesn't know.

1935
01:26:58,400 --> 01:27:00,140
He doesn't know, he doesn't know, he doesn't know.

1936
01:27:00,740 --> 01:27:01,040
No!

1937
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:02,480
He doesn't!

1938
01:27:02,500 --> 01:27:03,020
No!

1939
01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:04,960
It's after you!

1940
01:27:05,440 --> 01:27:06,520
It's after you!

1941
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:07,280
I'm not heavy!

1942
01:27:07,620 --> 01:27:10,860
Just so you know, I am not walking towards Sai.

1943
01:27:11,460 --> 01:27:12,460
Just so you...

1944
01:27:12,460 --> 01:27:13,920
I think I killed Sai.

1945
01:27:14,420 --> 01:27:15,280
Just so you know.

1946
01:27:15,440 --> 01:27:18,280
I'm not walking towards Sai.

1947
01:27:18,860 --> 01:27:20,420
Just so you know.

1948
01:27:20,660 --> 01:27:22,320
Oh shit!

1949
01:27:23,220 --> 01:27:26,340
In my defense, the tree trunk got in my way.

1950
01:27:26,940 --> 01:27:27,840
She did it!

1951
01:27:28,940 --> 01:27:29,760
She won!

1952
01:27:30,580 --> 01:27:31,080
The hunters!

1953
01:27:32,500 --> 01:27:34,680
That map is so hard.

1954
01:27:34,760 --> 01:27:37,180
That tree really fucked me over.

1955
01:27:38,500 --> 01:27:42,160
But my hoof got stuck on the branch and I couldn't.

1956
01:27:42,900 --> 01:27:43,140
I know.

1957
01:27:43,340 --> 01:27:45,660
I told you it's not about the size.

1958
01:27:45,900 --> 01:27:47,140
It's how you use it.

1959
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:49,040
It got stuck.

1960
01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:51,560
My antlers were too big.

1961
01:27:52,060 --> 01:27:53,100
Who's running already?

1962
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:56,760

01:29:25,680 --> 01:29:26,880

1998
01:29:33,160 --> 01:29:34,360

I'll walk.

2003
01:29:37,200 --> 01:29:38,640
I'll walk out of you.

2004
01:29:38,920 --> 01:29:39,880
I walked out of you.

2005
01:29:41,880 --> 01:29:42,320
Wait, there's...

2006
01:29:42,320 --> 01:29:43,540

2007
01:29:43,960 --> 01:29:44,720
Why are you walking away?

2008
01:29:44,980 --> 01:29:45,760
That better not be you.

2009
01:29:46,060 --> 01:29:47,800
We don't know.

2010
01:29:48,140 --> 01:29:48,940
We don't know.

2011
01:29:49,320 --> 01:29:51,660
He's shooting random deer now.

2012
01:29:52,220 --> 01:29:54,440
He's shooting random deer.

2013
01:29:55,880 --> 01:29:56,620
He's nervous.

2014
01:29:56,900 --> 01:29:57,260
He's scared.

2015
01:29:57,440 --> 01:29:58,320
He's so scared.

2016
01:29:58,340 --> 01:29:59,420
Of course I fucking am.

2017
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:00,420
I'm scared.

2018
01:30:00,980 --> 01:30:01,240
Paranoid.

2019
01:30:02,080 --> 01:30:05,940
He doesn't know which one's the right, dear.

2020
01:30:07,320 --> 01:30:08,460
Come on, come on, Sayu.

2021
01:30:08,620 --> 01:30:09,320
You love gotcha.

01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:10,160

01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:11,480
Yeah, just choose one.

2024
01:30:11,680 --> 01:30:13,600
It could be any of us.

2025
01:30:14,060 --> 01:30:14,780
Come on.

2026
01:30:15,520 --> 01:30:16,480
Come on.

2027
01:30:17,620 --> 01:30:21,300
It's all, it's all, you know what, the gotcha rates?

2028
01:30:21,420 --> 01:30:23,840
I think the gotcha rates is in your favor right now.

2029
01:30:23,920 --> 01:30:24,160
I know.

2030
01:30:24,360 --> 01:30:25,340
I've seen you pull.

2031
01:30:25,420 --> 01:30:26,240
You've been pretty lucky.

2032
01:30:26,720 --> 01:30:27,840
No, I have not.

2033
01:30:28,260 --> 01:30:29,240
Break, break.

2034
01:30:29,780 --> 01:30:31,160
Don't be a coward.

2035
01:30:31,400 --> 01:30:31,860
Take a shot.

2036
01:30:31,880 --> 01:30:32,940
Take a shot.

2037
01:30:33,080 --> 01:30:34,380
That could be me right now.

2038
01:30:34,640 --> 01:30:35,180
Take the shot.

2039
01:30:35,440 --> 01:30:36,460
You're on the floor.

2040
01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:37,520
Take the shot.

2041
01:30:41,680 --> 01:30:42,820
Take the other shot.

2042
01:30:43,500 --> 01:30:45,660

2043
01:30:45,900 --> 01:30:46,840
You should take the shot.

2044
01:30:48,540 --> 01:30:49,180
Test your gotcha.

2045
01:30:49,640 --> 01:30:51,620
Don't you want to look at my, you know, my...

2046
01:30:51,620 --> 01:30:52,420

2048
01:30:54,180 --> 01:30:56,200
Test the gotcha right now.

2049
01:30:56,880 --> 01:30:57,840
Test the gotcha.

2050
01:30:58,600 --> 01:30:59,080
Quick, quick.

2051
01:30:59,160 --> 01:30:59,580
Oh yeah, quick.

2052
01:30:59,640 --> 01:31:00,740
There's so many of us here.

2053
01:31:01,040 --> 01:31:01,860
Yeah, there's so many of us here.

2054
01:31:01,880 --> 01:31:02,800
He's here.

2055
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:04,280
Take the shot.

2056
01:31:04,600 --> 01:31:05,040
Take the shot.

2057
01:31:06,140 --> 01:31:07,060
I'm resting.

2058
01:31:07,320 --> 01:31:08,040
I'm resting right now.

2059
01:31:08,340 --> 01:31:08,460
I'm resting.

2060
01:31:08,920 --> 01:31:09,900
You're not see me, Rezing.

2061
01:31:10,660 --> 01:31:10,860
You're not Rezing.

2062
01:31:10,860 --> 01:31:12,280
You are not Rezing at all.

2063
01:31:12,420 --> 01:31:13,540
You're not Rezing at all.

2064
01:31:13,540 --> 01:31:13,960
You're not see me, Rez.

2065
01:31:16,720 --> 01:31:17,660
You're not seeing me, Rez.

2066
01:31:17,660 --> 01:31:20,000
Wait, why did I keep getting the E to revive Khori?

2067
01:31:20,020 --> 01:31:21,140
Why did it so well?

2068
01:31:21,800 --> 01:31:22,780
Take the shot.

2069
01:31:23,100 --> 01:31:23,700
Take it.

2070
01:31:23,880 --> 01:31:24,980
Take the shot.

2071
01:31:25,640 --> 01:31:26,380
Oh my god.

2072
01:31:27,960 --> 01:31:28,760
Oh my god.

2073
01:31:28,780 --> 01:31:29,700
Oh my god.

2074
01:31:32,920 --> 01:31:34,880
Nice gotcha, it is!

2075
01:31:35,180 --> 01:31:36,260
That was like, yeah!

2076
01:31:36,980 --> 01:31:37,680
Oh my god!

2077
01:31:39,140 --> 01:31:40,520
It was an early pull.

2078
01:31:43,080 --> 01:31:44,680
I still take that as a win.

2079
01:31:45,200 --> 01:31:47,460
Back to back five stars, that's crazy!

2080
01:31:47,980 --> 01:31:49,480
That's a win in my book.

2081
01:31:49,780 --> 01:31:50,920
That's my win.

2082
01:31:54,340 --> 01:31:55,680
Oh my goodness!

2083
01:31:57,740 --> 01:31:58,260
Oh!

2084
01:31:58,820 --> 01:32:00,340
Have we played on this one?

2085
01:32:00,440 --> 01:32:00,540
Oh!

2086
01:32:00,540 --> 01:32:01,860
I think we did one.

2087
01:32:01,880 --> 01:32:03,060
Oh, we haven't.

2088
01:32:03,220 --> 01:32:04,920
Look, I think he got a pity there.

2089
01:32:05,060 --> 01:32:06,040
That was a pity pull.

2090
01:32:06,220 --> 01:32:08,220
And that 100% was hard pity.

2091
01:32:09,080 --> 01:32:10,880
Why me?

2092
01:32:12,360 --> 01:32:15,560
Oh, we know who it is now.

2093
01:32:17,060 --> 01:32:17,580
I'm scared.

2094
01:32:17,820 --> 01:32:18,200
I'm scared.

2095
01:32:18,420 --> 01:32:20,140
A gun isn't enough to hold you back.

2096
01:32:20,340 --> 01:32:21,300
A gun isn't enough.

2097
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:23,120
It's nighttime.

2098
01:32:23,580 --> 01:32:24,960
Welcome to the circus.

2099
01:32:27,340 --> 01:32:30,000
I just came to see a funny clown.

2100
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,920
Well, come to the circus of value!

2101
01:32:33,780 --> 01:32:34,280
Oh, no.

2102
01:32:35,400 --> 01:32:36,800
In the end, it was you.

2103
01:32:37,080 --> 01:32:38,460
You were the clown.

2104
01:32:40,240 --> 01:32:42,480
Kill the clowns.

2105
01:32:43,560 --> 01:32:44,160
Where is she?

2106
01:32:44,300 --> 01:32:45,280
Wait, where is she?

2107
01:32:45,620 --> 01:32:47,160
I can't fight it.

2108
01:32:47,200 --> 01:32:48,080
I don't see her.

2109
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:49,760
Why are you getting close to?

2110
01:32:50,160 --> 01:32:50,600
Who are you?

2111
01:32:51,420 --> 01:32:53,200
Oh, I see her.

2112
01:32:53,440 --> 01:32:54,900
Oh, I see her, too.

2113
01:32:55,500 --> 01:32:56,600
Stay away from me!

2114
01:32:57,140 --> 01:32:57,860
Stay away from me!

2115
01:32:58,640 --> 01:32:59,920
I'm right next.

2116
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,760
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

2117
01:33:03,220 --> 01:33:04,000
Look behind you.

2118
01:33:04,480 --> 01:33:06,000
Look behind you.

2119
01:33:09,220 --> 01:33:10,460
Look behind you.

2143
01:34:49,180 --> 01:34:50,140
I thought you were an NPC.

2144
01:34:51,260 --> 01:34:51,600
What?

2145
01:34:52,040 --> 01:34:53,140
Oh, Fruit.

2146
01:34:54,480 --> 01:34:55,680
Wake up!

2147
01:34:56,760 --> 01:34:58,840
The skin walkers are here!

2148
01:35:00,720 --> 01:35:01,840
Holy crap.

2149
01:35:02,240 --> 01:35:04,320
You missed out on this amazing event.

2150
01:35:04,340 --> 01:35:05,260
Are you team-backing me?

2151
01:35:06,040 --> 01:35:07,460
Yo, dead ass though.

2152
01:35:07,740 --> 01:35:08,680
Dead ass though.

2153
01:35:09,380 --> 01:35:14,220
There is a tent in there and inside of it are a bunch of
scary ass jack-o'-lanterns.

2154
01:35:14,220 --> 01:35:14,460
Wait.

2155
01:35:15,740 --> 01:35:21,740
And I was just standing on two feet being like, welcome,
come in.

2156
01:35:21,880 --> 01:35:22,180
Oh.

2157

Oh, shit.

2158
01:35:25,600 --> 01:35:28,660
That was like the scariest game I've played all year.

2159
01:35:28,780 --> 01:35:29,220
That is the...

2160
01:35:29,220 --> 01:35:29,980

I just saw that.

2166
01:36:04,100 --> 01:36:05,140
I just saw that.

2167
01:36:05,460 --> 01:36:05,820
Worth it.

2168
01:36:06,120 --> 01:36:09,480
If you're excuse me, I'm going to retire now.

2169
01:36:10,280 --> 01:36:10,720
I'm chewing.

2170
01:36:11,340 --> 01:36:11,760
Don't worry.

2171
01:36:11,940 --> 01:36:15,180
He's definitely not crawling towards another deer.

2172
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:18,880
I'm just gonna shake.

2173
01:36:19,100 --> 01:36:24,640
Oh, he's definitely not crawling to another deer waiting to
get revived.

2174
01:36:25,580 --> 01:36:25,700
Nope.

2175
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:26,240
Nope.

2176
01:36:26,380 --> 01:36:27,640
That's not what I'm doing.

2177
01:36:27,660 --> 01:36:27,680
Nope.

2178
01:36:27,700 --> 01:36:28,940
He's not doing that.

2179
01:36:29,340 --> 01:36:29,880
That's right.

2180
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:30,960
Trader Bill!

2181
01:36:30,960 --> 01:36:31,380

2185
01:36:37,100 --> 01:36:37,660
I...

2186
01:36:37,660 --> 01:36:39,560
Just keep...

2187
01:36:40,240 --> 01:36:41,120
That's right.

2188
01:36:42,140 --> 01:36:43,660
Guys, I'm so safe.

2189
01:36:43,740 --> 01:36:44,780
Don't worry, I'm so safe.

2190
01:36:44,860 --> 01:36:46,860
She is, like, not near me at all.

2191
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:49,760
Guys, I'm in the...

2192
01:36:50,480 --> 01:36:51,460
I'm in the river.

2193
01:36:52,020 --> 01:36:52,820
I'm in the river.

2194
01:36:54,260 --> 01:36:54,820
Just...

2195
01:36:54,820 --> 01:36:57,860
Just start grazing on my body and I'll be okay.

2196
01:36:58,720 --> 01:36:59,280
Just...

2197
01:36:59,280 --> 01:36:59,560
Fruit.

2198
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:01,280
It's gonna be so natural.

2199
01:37:01,760 --> 01:37:03,000
Where are you?

2200
01:37:03,060 --> 01:37:04,660
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

2201
01:37:04,660 --> 01:37:05,340
She can't see me.

2202
01:37:05,440 --> 01:37:06,240
I'm in the water.

2203
01:37:07,360 --> 01:37:08,180
Are you scared?

2204
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:10,480
Is this terrifying for you?

2205
01:37:10,740 --> 01:37:11,500
It's a little bit.

2206
01:37:11,500 --> 01:37:11,920
We'll body block.

2207
01:37:12,500 --> 01:37:18,840
You remember that scene from Toy Story 1 where all the dead
toys were crawling to save cats.

2208
01:37:19,320 --> 01:37:20,580
You're saved now.

2209
01:37:21,660 --> 01:37:23,340
I can't get out of the river.

2210
01:37:23,740 --> 01:37:24,560
What are you doing?

2211
01:37:25,440 --> 01:37:26,840
This one is fruit.

2212
01:37:27,240 --> 01:37:27,920
It's me.

2213
01:37:28,220 --> 01:37:29,020
I'm fruit.

2214
01:37:34,820 --> 01:37:52,440
here I might not have my front legs anymore but I have my
passion you're going crazy looks like we're all fruit here

2215
01:37:52,440 --> 01:38:02,000

fucking scary it's so scary It's always scary when you're

2216
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:05,280
not looking at the deer, you just hear the footsteps coming
from behind you.

2217
01:38:07,140 --> 01:38:09,260
It is so loud too.

2218
01:38:09,640 --> 01:38:12,380
You never know which is the right one.

2219
01:38:12,700 --> 01:38:14,580
Oh, back, back where it all started.

2220
01:38:16,620 --> 01:38:17,920
Going back to school.

2221
01:38:19,500 --> 01:38:21,480
That's why we banned all the rules.

2222
01:38:21,880 --> 01:38:24,580
Hey guys, how about we give them an education?

2223
01:38:25,240 --> 01:38:25,700
What the fuck?

2224
01:38:25,840 --> 01:38:26,680
How did you die already?

2225
01:38:33,180 --> 01:38:36,260
I was just excited about deer school.

2226
01:38:36,580 --> 01:38:37,860
I'm gonna camp your body.

2227
01:38:38,200 --> 01:38:39,280
You're a whore.

2228
01:38:40,940 --> 01:38:42,500
That's so fucked up.

2229
01:38:43,220 --> 01:38:44,240
Get away from me, you freak.

2230
01:38:45,220 --> 01:38:47,860
Bro, how could you do that to him?

2231
01:38:47,940 --> 01:38:49,700
He's just trying to be a deer.

2232
01:38:50,680 --> 01:38:52,140
He's just trying to go to deer high.

2233
01:38:54,620 --> 01:38:56,140
He's trying to get an education.

2234
01:38:56,600 --> 01:38:58,100
Yeah, he's trying to get a degree.

2235
01:38:58,760 --> 01:38:59,300
Get away from me.

2236
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:01,360
I can't believe it.

2237
01:39:01,540 --> 01:39:04,080
Now he's going to be held back and it's going to be your
fault.

2238
01:39:07,700 --> 01:39:10,880
What will his dear parents say?

2239
01:39:13,600 --> 01:39:13,640
Oh.

2240
01:39:14,060 --> 01:39:15,180
He has no future.

2241
01:39:15,540 --> 01:39:16,460
Get away from me.

2242
01:39:21,940 --> 01:39:23,820
I don't like you.

2243
01:39:24,300 --> 01:39:24,840
Go away.

2244
01:39:25,300 --> 01:39:26,200
Don't give me.

2245
01:39:26,840 --> 01:39:28,540
Ain't nobody going to revive you.

2246
01:39:30,180 --> 01:39:32,100

01:39:57,540 --> 01:39:58,580
Wait, where are you?

2264
01:40:01,960 --> 01:40:03,020
Maybe you should gotcha.

2265
01:40:03,220 --> 01:40:04,060
I'm in your right mood.

2266
01:40:05,120 --> 01:40:07,000
Should this be you, bro?

2267
01:40:07,480 --> 01:40:09,020

2268
01:40:09,700 --> 01:40:11,160
I'm shaking my booty.

2269
01:40:11,480 --> 01:40:12,520
What of it?

2270
01:40:12,700 --> 01:40:12,920

2271
01:40:13,200 --> 01:40:13,600

2275
01:40:17,500 --> 01:40:18,340
Are you entertained?

2277
01:40:22,660 --> 01:40:23,740
Whoa, that was perfect.

2278
01:40:24,020 --> 01:40:24,940

Oh, I gotta shake my, I gotta shake my ass for a second.

2282
01:40:42,440 --> 01:40:43,260
Are you not up?

2283
01:40:43,440 --> 01:40:45,360

2284
01:40:45,620 --> 01:40:46,620
You're alive, Sai!

2285
01:40:47,320 --> 01:40:47,700
I'm not?

2286
01:40:48,180 --> 01:40:49,180
Wait, what?

2287
01:40:50,540 --> 01:40:51,820
I'm not alive?

2288
01:40:51,940 --> 01:40:54,220
I tried to revive you like two times!

2289
01:40:54,940 --> 01:40:56,680
Hey, don't look at me, I'm still flopping around.

2290
01:40:56,700 --> 01:40:57,660
I can't believe it.

2291
01:40:57,800 --> 01:40:59,980
This is why you flunked out of deer hide.

2292
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:03,080
Why do you think I was trying to get educated?

2293
01:41:03,540 --> 01:41:06,000
That's exactly why you flunked out.

2294
01:41:07,860 --> 01:41:08,460
Please.

2295
01:41:08,960 --> 01:41:09,420
Don't worry.

2296
01:41:10,200 --> 01:41:10,600
Don't worry.

2297
01:41:10,960 --> 01:41:11,820
I got you.

2298
01:41:12,240 --> 01:41:13,040
You are...

2299
01:41:13,040 --> 01:41:13,540
Yes!

2300
01:41:14,160 --> 01:41:14,380
Oh!

2301
01:41:14,720 --> 01:41:15,460
Fruit works!

2302
01:41:19,460 --> 01:41:24,120
All I'm saying, sigh, is that fruit was an easy red.

2303
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:25,460
Yeah.

2304
01:41:26,020 --> 01:41:27,040
I'm not that easy.

2305
01:41:27,200 --> 01:41:28,200
Did you ever think about that?

2306
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,080
Oh, here we go.

2307
01:41:32,540 --> 01:41:33,800
Here we go.

2308
01:41:33,880 --> 01:41:35,060
It's time.

2309
01:41:35,900 --> 01:41:37,040

We contributed.

2313
01:41:48,960 --> 01:41:51,280
You can actually teabag when you're still out.

2314
01:41:51,660 --> 01:41:52,220
It's so funny.

2315
01:41:52,760 --> 01:41:53,200

He's just...

2337
01:43:50,280 --> 01:43:55,520
Uh, hey, not to alarm anyone, but, uh, fruit kicked me out
of the map.

2338
01:43:56,240 --> 01:43:57,980
Yeah, I think it was, like, bagged up.

2339
01:43:58,840 --> 01:43:59,780
Yeah, look at him!

2340
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:00,880
Wait, look at him.

I'm gonna explore the...

2343
01:44:05,220 --> 01:44:08,840
I'm gonna explore the outside world.

2344
01:44:08,840 --> 01:44:09,200
No!

2345
01:44:10,360 --> 01:44:12,180
Down by... Oh my god.

2346
01:44:12,640 --> 01:44:13,700
Are you seeing things?

2347
01:44:13,840 --> 01:44:14,440
Are you seeing things?

2348
01:44:14,440 --> 01:44:16,700
This is the trippiest shit ever!

2349
01:44:17,340 --> 01:44:18,700
I'm falling off!

2350
01:44:22,900 --> 01:44:24,180
You like off the map?

2351
01:44:24,960 --> 01:44:26,260
Bro, I am literally falling...

2352
01:44:26,260 --> 01:44:27,380
He's in a different dimension.

2353
01:44:28,120 --> 01:44:30,000
He's in another world now.

2354
01:44:30,380 --> 01:44:31,100
Oh my god!

2355
01:44:31,520 --> 01:44:32,000
Wait, what?

2356
01:44:32,760 --> 01:44:33,940
Did you see that?

2357
01:44:34,500 --> 01:44:35,540
Where is he?

2358
01:44:35,620 --> 01:44:37,700
A deer just went out to fly suddenly.

2359
01:44:39,520 --> 01:44:41,040
Just suddenly went out to fly.

2360
01:44:41,280 --> 01:44:41,780
What the frick?

2361
01:44:41,920 --> 01:44:43,040
Is he in the sky?

2362
01:44:43,340 --> 01:44:43,640
Where is he?

2363
01:44:44,160 --> 01:44:44,800
Dude, my body.

2364
01:44:44,960 --> 01:44:45,460
He left.

2365
01:44:46,240 --> 01:44:48,620
My body is falling.

2366
01:44:49,120 --> 01:44:50,120
He's like freaking.

2367
01:44:50,960 --> 01:44:51,660
I'm leaving.

2368
01:44:55,260 --> 01:44:57,700
See, this is what happens when you let me play a game.

2369
01:44:57,960 --> 01:45:00,060
I have the tendency to break these fucking things.

2370
01:45:01,640 --> 01:45:02,160
I'm just saying.

2371
01:45:02,160 --> 01:45:04,000
I think this game is pretty broken.

2372
01:45:04,120 --> 01:45:06,800
Amalia is definitely not heading towards me.

2373
01:45:06,860 --> 01:45:07,820
I'm going to head to the bushes.

2374
01:45:08,120 --> 01:45:09,380
Yeah, so I can break them all.

2375
01:45:10,320 --> 01:45:11,560
Amalia, head to the bushes.

2376
01:45:12,680 --> 01:45:13,180
I'm in there.

2377
01:45:13,480 --> 01:45:13,960
I'm in there.

2378
01:45:14,080 --> 01:45:14,560
Head to the bushes.

2379
01:45:15,500 --> 01:45:15,960
I'm in there.

2380
01:45:16,100 --> 01:45:16,440
I'm in there.

2381
01:45:16,580 --> 01:45:17,200
I'm in there.

2382
01:45:17,480 --> 01:45:18,860
You stay away from me.

2383
01:45:21,020 --> 01:45:22,920
Which one's the real deer?

2384
01:45:23,900 --> 01:45:27,460
Man, I sure wish I could see my friends playing the deer
game.

2385
01:45:28,840 --> 01:45:30,820
Shouldn't have fallen through the map.

Guys, I think the hunter's won.

2390
01:45:53,460 --> 01:45:54,380
I fell off the map!

2391
01:45:55,100 --> 01:45:56,360

2392
01:45:56,440 --> 01:45:57,580
Oh, I didn't know I got you.

2393
01:45:58,840 --> 01:46:00,260
We're his size.

2394
01:46:00,460 --> 01:46:02,200
He's like roaming the depths.

2395
01:46:02,940 --> 01:46:06,960
Dude, I'm in Until Dawn is how far away I am.

2396
01:46:09,260 --> 01:46:10,500
I can't believe it.

2397
01:46:10,660 --> 01:46:14,080
Bro, fruit has the luckiest gotcha out of all of us right
there.

2398
01:46:14,520 --> 01:46:15,620

Do the pull.

2412
01:47:08,740 --> 01:47:09,580
Maybe you'll get the pity.

2413
01:47:10,260 --> 01:47:11,980
Just for five, that'd be fine.

2414
01:47:12,420 --> 01:47:13,400
You'll get the pity right there.

Well, well!

2424
01:47:32,600 --> 01:47:34,480
Okay, your pity is your pity.

2425
01:47:35,160 --> 01:47:36,240
You're lucky I'm a match.

2426
01:47:36,580 --> 01:47:37,960
That's right, you can't even get me.

2427
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:39,400
You look mad at good and orange.

2428
01:47:40,140 --> 01:47:41,900
Ooh, are you going to look at that boulder now?

2429
01:47:42,240 --> 01:47:44,700
Whoever comes out of that boulder might be me.

2430
01:47:45,680 --> 01:47:46,220
The boulder?

2431
01:47:47,500 --> 01:47:49,020
Do we're distracting him?

2432
01:47:49,020 --> 01:47:49,900
Go, go, go!

2433
01:47:52,800 --> 01:47:54,100
All right, we're moving in.

2434
01:47:54,360 --> 01:47:55,220
We're moving in.

2435
01:47:56,180 --> 01:47:57,300
We're moving in.

2436
01:47:58,420 --> 01:48:00,040
Wait, Anneli, are you dead?

2437
01:48:01,440 --> 01:48:01,900
Nope.

2438
01:48:02,400 --> 01:48:03,940
No, Anneli's just a...

2439
01:48:03,940 --> 01:48:04,480
Oh, shit!

2440
01:48:05,360 --> 01:48:06,760
It's crouching next to me.

2441
01:48:06,780 --> 01:48:08,540
You're lucky I'm a bad shit!

2442
01:48:10,440 --> 01:48:12,720
You missed a dead old man!

2443
01:48:14,060 --> 01:48:15,660
That's right, I'm an old man.

2444
01:48:16,300 --> 01:48:16,900

Why the fuck?

2449
01:48:45,520 --> 01:48:46,900
Bro, I shot three different times.

2450
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:48,340
Chat, you saw that.

2451
01:48:48,520 --> 01:48:49,380
My bullets weren't working.

2452
01:48:50,380 --> 01:48:51,200
My bullets weren't working.

2453
01:48:51,360 --> 01:48:53,560
Maybe you're just missing.

2454
01:48:55,780 --> 01:48:57,300
Why are you shooting at?

2455
01:48:57,820 --> 01:48:59,860
Bro, you're shooting at me!

2456
01:49:00,120 --> 01:49:00,980
Shoot again, Andrew!

2457
01:49:01,500 --> 01:49:02,940
What are you shooting at?

2458
01:49:03,400 --> 01:49:06,540
Wait, is there no deer there for you guys?

2459
01:49:06,920 --> 01:49:08,540
There was never a deer there.

2460
01:49:08,720 --> 01:49:09,160
Wait, where?

2461
01:49:09,160 --> 01:49:09,160
No?

2462
01:49:10,080 --> 01:49:10,820
We're shooting at nothing.

2463
01:49:11,260 --> 01:49:12,260
One side of the map right now.

2464
01:49:12,540 --> 01:49:13,540
Go up to the deer.

2465
01:49:13,820 --> 01:49:15,060
Yeah, you were shooting at nothing.

2466
01:49:15,640 --> 01:49:17,280
All right, all right, but no one trample me.

2467
01:49:17,420 --> 01:49:18,200
Yeah, no problem.

2468
01:49:22,240 --> 01:49:26,280
I shot you at different times.

2469
01:49:26,880 --> 01:49:28,140
I shot you, Chad.

2470
01:49:28,480 --> 01:49:29,800
You all saw it.

2471
01:49:33,560 --> 01:49:35,000
You all saw it.

2472
01:49:36,640 --> 01:49:40,060
I shot that deer, that specific deer.

2473
01:49:40,220 --> 01:49:42,300
I shot different times.

2474
01:49:42,500 --> 01:49:44,700
I don't know, maybe you were missing.

2475
01:49:44,720 --> 01:49:47,000
This game is beyond rigged!

2476
01:49:47,620 --> 01:49:49,640
I don't know, maybe you just missed, huh?

2477
01:49:54,180 --> 01:49:55,740
Maybe you were missing.

2478
01:49:58,120 --> 01:49:58,340
What?

2479
01:49:58,460 --> 01:49:59,820
Did he shot you guys?

2480
01:50:00,060 --> 01:50:00,980
No, yeah!

2481
01:50:01,140 --> 01:50:02,640
He got both of us somehow!

2482
01:50:03,340 --> 01:50:04,460
How did he get both of you guys?

2483
01:50:04,640 --> 01:50:05,760
Not me!

2484
01:50:06,680 --> 01:50:09,440
That's fucking karma, you sons of bitches!

2485
01:50:09,660 --> 01:50:10,640
How did he not get me?

2486
01:50:12,500 --> 01:50:14,160
We got both of you.

2487
01:50:14,200 --> 01:50:15,640
I don't know what it's like.

2488
01:50:19,560 --> 01:50:20,300
What the?

2489
01:50:20,380 --> 01:50:21,460
Oh, you're just jumping.

2490
01:50:21,860 --> 01:50:23,360
For a second, I thought you were levitating.

2491
01:50:23,500 --> 01:50:24,080
I was like, oh.

2492
01:50:28,380 --> 01:50:31,260
You've got to be fucking kidding me.

2493
01:50:34,560 --> 01:50:35,960
You never get me.

2494
01:50:39,140 --> 01:50:41,240
I'm like that, what's that whale story?

2495
01:50:42,840 --> 01:50:46,460

01:54:26,290 --> 01:54:27,330
He actually did it.

I don't know about you, but yeah, this is so much fun.

2569
01:54:31,490 --> 01:54:32,010
It was amazing.

2570
01:54:32,730 --> 01:54:33,550
I love this game.

2571
01:54:33,670 --> 01:54:34,450
This is what this game is.

2572
01:54:35,490 --> 01:54:40,110
They got to increase the player, like palliative size.

2573
01:54:40,490 --> 01:54:41,550
That would be so fun.

2574
01:54:41,590 --> 01:54:43,930
The player size and like more maps.

2575
01:54:44,130 --> 01:54:45,390
I think it would be so fun.

2576
01:54:46,270 --> 01:54:47,550
It's still early access.

2577
01:54:47,750 --> 01:54:48,710
It's still early access.

2578
01:54:49,750 --> 01:54:52,130
I definitely liked the imposter one the most.

2579
01:54:52,390 --> 01:54:54,350
That one was my favorite game though.

2580
01:54:54,850 --> 01:54:55,550
That one's the best.

2581
01:54:56,550 --> 01:54:57,670

2582
01:54:57,730 --> 01:54:59,230

01:55:00,870 --> 01:55:01,430
GG's.

2585
01:55:01,690 --> 01:55:03,930
Yeah, I had a great time.

2586
01:55:04,470 --> 01:55:06,670
I'd never laughed so much in my life.

2587
01:55:06,670 --> 01:55:06,910
I know.

2588
01:55:08,430 --> 01:55:09,810
It was super chaotic.

2589
01:55:10,470 --> 01:55:14,090
And then my favorite part was just making a sigh so fucking
paranoid.

2590
01:55:15,350 --> 01:55:17,010
Well, it worked.

2591
01:55:18,630 --> 01:55:20,330

2592
01:55:20,610 --> 01:55:21,350
I hope you have wonderful dreams.

2593
01:55:21,450 --> 01:55:24,730
I was like so close to you for so long, but you never took
the shot.

2594
01:55:24,850 --> 01:55:25,090
I do.

2595
01:55:26,270 --> 01:55:27,750
She was saying take the shot.

2596
01:55:27,850 --> 01:55:29,570
That was actually her the whole time.

2597
01:55:30,090 --> 01:55:31,970
You look so happy.

2598
01:55:34,470 --> 01:55:35,790
Oh, my dog.

01:55:35,910 --> 01:55:37,350

01:55:57,850 --> 01:56:04,370
When the game first came out, it was like the game, when the

jump.

like um i'm definitely in the future for this game i'm gonna

2666
01:59:59,860 --> 02:00:07,440
wait until there's more uh there's more like modes to it and
more like maps and stuff because like it's definitely a

2667
02:00:07,440 --> 02:00:17,540
one-off this is uh this is definitely a one-off game because
um at a point it gets it gets old if we play it too long uh

2668
02:00:17,540 --> 02:00:26,120
yeah but there's more content in there it'd be definitely be
more fun um code thank you for the super chat thank you

2690
02:01:37,360 --> 02:01:46,400
about guys this is this is a true hunting experience like if
you're if the deers don't stand up on their two feet that's

2691
02:01:46,400 --> 02:01:54,060
not real hunting you gotta watch out for those skin walkers
they're right there

2692
02:01:57,260 --> 02:01:58,740
one of us.

2693
02:01:58,980 --> 02:02:07,860
It's like that adventure time, that adventure time, uh, uh,
deer meme where he takes off his hose and he's like, man.

2694
02:02:10,960 --> 02:02:13,940
Uh, uh, Wayne, thank you for the super chat.

Thank you.

2697
02:02:14,880 --> 02:02:15,560
I'm in Europe.

2698
02:02:15,680 --> 02:02:15,920
Thank you.

2699
02:02:16,100 --> 02:02:17,120
Night shift lets me watch.

2700
02:02:17,180 --> 02:02:17,500
Yeah.

2701
02:02:17,660 --> 02:02:17,880
Thank you.

2702
02:02:17,960 --> 02:02:18,360
The super chat.

2703
02:02:18,400 --> 02:02:19,080
Thank you.

2704
02:02:19,120 --> 02:02:19,500
Yeah.

2705
02:02:19,560 --> 02:02:24,380
Trying to get like, I always have like a very consistent,
uh, stream schedule.

2706
02:02:24,940 --> 02:02:28,720
So most of like 5 p.m p.m.

2707
02:02:29,440 --> 02:02:29,920
p.m.

2708
02:02:30,040 --> 02:02:30,200
p.m.

2709
02:02:30,200 --> 02:02:30,320
p.m.

2710
02:02:30,620 --> 02:02:36,420
and if i collabs with people on the other side of the world
obviously it's going to be a little later um so i do try to

2711
02:02:36,420 --> 02:02:46,240
keep it very consistent um but i do apologize for people on
the other side of the world because uh it's not it's my

2712
02:02:46,240 --> 02:02:57,520
streams for them is like super early in the morning so like
i do apologize for that my usual streams uh let's see Thank

2713
02:02:57,520 --> 02:02:57,640
you.

2714
02:02:57,660 --> 02:03:00,380
Only the tomato skin is expensive, not the skin.

2715
02:03:00,480 --> 02:03:01,360
See, thank you in the super chat.

2716
02:03:01,540 --> 02:03:02,020
Thank you.

2717
02:03:02,020 --> 02:03:02,120
Thank you.

2718
02:03:02,180 --> 02:03:02,720
Oh, my God.

2719
02:03:02,920 --> 02:03:08,760
But speaking of, like, streams on the other side of the
world, streams for the people on the other side of the

2720
02:03:08,760 --> 02:03:16,820
world, I would be collabing next week with Ditto, Uto, and
RPR, I think.

2721
02:03:16,900 --> 02:03:19,400
We're doing Lethal Company next week.

2722
02:03:19,500 --> 02:03:20,080
I think we are.

2723
02:03:20,280 --> 02:03:24,040
We're still setting that up, but I assume it was supposed to
be this week.

2724
02:03:24,460 --> 02:03:27,240
But there's so many stuff happening for me this week.

2725
02:03:27,260 --> 02:03:34,120
that um we decided to move it to next week so um we're still
deciding the day and the time but we'll be playing lethal

2726
02:03:34,120 --> 02:03:42,100
company for next week uh yeah that's i think that's i mean
it's really hard because like i try to organize i try not to

2727
02:03:42,100 --> 02:03:47,680
like stuff so the thing about this was like i'm planning on
doing a stream talking about like how i my mind works when

2728
02:03:47,680 --> 02:03:54,440
it comes to streaming but like um the best advice i can give
people is that this like a sneak peek to this like the

2729
02:03:54,440 --> 02:03:59,240
stream that i'm planning that i've been writing notes for
about like um making not just vtubing but like content

2730
02:03:59,240 --> 02:04:07,720
creation but like um i try not to put too many collabs in
one week but if there is a lot of collabs in for a week i

2731
02:04:07,720 --> 02:04:15,800
balance it out with more solo streams um because you don't
want to have two more collabs than uh solo streams and it's

2732
02:04:15,800 --> 02:04:25,600
more so like um you try to do for me right now my for me
right now I try to have like at least one to two collabs a

2733
02:04:25,600 --> 02:04:27,540
week just to get started.

2734
02:04:28,340 --> 02:04:33,780
I think you might notice that this is a similar pattern when
I first started streaming.

2735
02:04:36,400 --> 02:04:41,140
When I first started, not first started streaming, but when
I first started being serious with streaming, when I kicked

2736
02:04:41,140 --> 02:04:45,500
things off, because when you're first starting out, you have
to get your name out there.

2737
02:04:45,900 --> 02:04:48,000
So like collabing is a great way to do that.

2738
02:04:48,880 --> 02:04:55,260
And, um, and so, you i had like a whole thing where i was
like every week i would like to have at least one collab

2739
02:04:55,260 --> 02:05:04,240
just to get my name out there and to like uh make people
know who i am because i was new i was new in the basically

2740
02:05:04,240 --> 02:05:15,720
new in the world uh so like because like now i'm restarting
my career again so that's why i try to make sure like every

2741
02:05:15,720 --> 02:05:22,320
week i have at least one to two collabs um if i collabs i
have like something like you know the tournaments or

2742
02:05:22,320 --> 02:05:32,060
something because that's considered a collab um so it's more
so of like uh like every week i want at least one collab

2743
02:05:32,060 --> 02:05:42,800
with someone um and it's good to to like networking uh and
despite me being an introvert i try my best to socialize as

2744
02:05:42,800 --> 02:05:43,980
much as I can

2745
02:05:48,400 --> 02:05:52,940
Chris, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you, I
couldn't be more proud of you on your new journey, I can't

you'll never 100% your Doki shrine, but you can try, you can

2747
02:06:01,120 --> 02:06:10,440
have 99% because you'll never beat me, it'll never be 100%
because you'll never beat me, keep doing your best, thank

2748
02:06:10,440 --> 02:06:17,480
you for the super chat thank you thank you thank you i can't
really wait for the intro to clap again is it coming is

2749
02:06:17,480 --> 02:06:25,300
still coming soon um i'm just uh it is soon tm soon tm i
don't have really have any updates other than the last time

2750
02:06:25,300 --> 02:06:31,740
i showed it oh sean thank you for the magenta super thank
you thank you it was a great game it was funny especially

2751
02:06:31,740 --> 02:06:38,500
the dear fovea thank you for the super chat thank you for
the magenta super thank you thank you i really appreciate

2752
02:06:38,500 --> 02:06:42,760
thank you But yeah, I think like right now, Osai, welcome to
the Tomei!

2753
02:06:46,970 --> 02:06:47,710
Thank you!

2754
02:06:48,010 --> 02:06:53,150
Thank you for joining us, I hope you had a great time being
paranoid now.

2755
02:06:54,130 --> 02:06:55,970
Now you trust me less.

2756
02:06:57,550 --> 02:07:00,590
I could be right behind you right now.

2757
02:07:03,770 --> 02:07:07,110
Um, uh, what was I saying?

2758
02:07:07,270 --> 02:07:13,270
Oh yeah, I think the hardest part about, also like the
reason why I've been like trying to like reach out to as

2759
02:07:13,270 --> 02:07:21,070
many different people as possible uh to collab is that i
want to try and find like i want to have like a consistent

2760
02:07:21,070 --> 02:07:27,450
group to have and so like if i ever want to do more group
collabs i can easily like hit people up for it because

2761
02:07:27,450 --> 02:07:34,110
there's a lot of group games i really really want to do like
i want to do like trouble in terraced town again and stuff

2762
02:07:34,110 --> 02:07:41,930
like that so I want to get to know as many people as
possible in the community and um and because like you know

2763
02:07:41,930 --> 02:07:49,350
it's harder as an indie I think to have a consistent group
of people to to play with and a consistent group of people

2764
02:07:49,350 --> 02:07:56,410
to like hit up and stuff to play and like the thing is I
have a lot of people I know and a lot of people I'm friends

2765
02:07:56,410 --> 02:08:04,150
with outside uh like not just like in the indie VTuber scene
not just in a vtuber scene but like outside of vtuber scene

2766
02:08:04,150 --> 02:08:12,650
but like the risky part is like mixing that group of people
so like i want i always try to keep it consistent like oh

2767
02:08:12,650 --> 02:08:24,490
like vtuber collabs and then out collabs outside mix collabs
and stuff like that so um uh and like uh expand my network

2768
02:08:24,490 --> 02:08:29,990
and meet as many people as possible so i can have like
consistent people i want to do collabs with or like want to

2769
02:08:29,990 --> 02:08:36,710
do group games because like there's so many fun multiplayer
games that I really really want to do and I want to have

2770
02:08:36,710 --> 02:08:42,730
like a group like people I can hit up on easily be like you
want to do this game you want to do that game um so a lot of

2771
02:08:42,730 --> 02:08:48,670
people I'm like interacting with for the first time or like
uh haven't interacted really much before never had a chance

2772
02:08:48,670 --> 02:08:53,150
to collab with so it's it's a lot my social battery

2773
02:09:00,870 --> 02:09:06,310
my best anyway i'm gonna read like three more super chats
and i'm gonna call it here because i need to rest my voice

2774
02:09:06,310 --> 02:09:15,570
for tomorrow because we do have a stream tomorrow um let's
see uh oh yeah by the way by the way um tempo confirmed to

2775
02:09:15,570 --> 02:09:22,370
me that because i made it to the finals i can't participate
in the other tournaments i only go straight to the final

2776
02:09:22,370 --> 02:09:34,350
tournament i'm like no i was like i should have thrown but
then i like bracket i'm joking I was like, I should have, I

2777
02:09:34,350 --> 02:09:35,830
should have threw my game.

2778
02:09:36,290 --> 02:09:37,090
Bracket, I'm joking.

2779
02:09:37,470 --> 02:09:37,750
Bracket.

2780
02:09:44,060 --> 02:09:47,580
I was like, no, I really wanted to do the third.

2781
02:09:47,800 --> 02:09:49,400
I really wanted to do the third one.

2782
02:09:49,500 --> 02:09:51,680
The third one looked so fun.

2783
02:09:52,040 --> 02:09:53,540
But the finals, they have it too.

2784
02:09:53,920 --> 02:09:55,200
No, the free money.

2785
02:09:58,620 --> 02:10:01,560
But were you serious about joking?

2786
02:10:03,640 --> 02:10:07,460
Navi, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank

2787
02:10:07,460 --> 02:10:10,020
you, thank you, thank you, I really appreciate it.

2788
02:10:10,160 --> 02:10:16,520
I always get, like, a lot of anxiety right before the
collab, because, like, obviously, like, when I'm collabing,

2789
02:10:16,760 --> 02:10:22,340
even if it's, like, what people I'm, like, used to collabing
with, like, if it's, like, a ditto collab or something,

2790
02:10:22,400 --> 02:10:25,420
like, I still get a lot of anxiety right before, like, an
hour before the collab.

2791
02:10:25,760 --> 02:10:32,200
I just need you guys to know, when I woke up, I ate lunch,
and then I took a four-hour nap right before the stream.

2792
02:10:32,340 --> 02:10:34,460
I literally woke up at like 4.30.

2793
02:10:34,820 --> 02:10:37,200
I was so stressed out.

2794
02:10:37,540 --> 02:10:39,320
I was just like really tired.

2795
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:43,260
I was just like, all right, wake up, food.

2796
02:10:43,420 --> 02:10:44,880
Oh wait, brush teeth, food.

2797
02:10:45,180 --> 02:10:46,080
And then I was like,

2798
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:52,820
and then I was like, okay.

2799
02:10:53,680 --> 02:10:58,420
And then my dad was like, Doki, it's 4.

2800
02:10:58,700 --> 02:11:00,200
It's 4.40.

2801
02:11:00,440 --> 02:11:01,120
Wake up!

2802
02:11:01,320 --> 02:11:01,700
I was like,

2803
02:11:06,600 --> 02:11:15,060
okay I did it I did it um I was getting really nervous
because the thing about collabs is that um versus a solo

2804
02:11:15,060 --> 02:11:20,820
stream is that you can't control what happens in the collab
you don't know what's gonna happen you don't know what the

2805
02:11:20,820 --> 02:11:26,760
chemistry is gonna be like especially with people you don't
you've never played with before so it's more so like oh you

2806
02:11:26,760 --> 02:11:33,260
don't know what the chemistry is gonna be like you don't
know what the uh what the uh what the game is going to be

2807
02:11:33,260 --> 02:11:39,040
like if it's a new game you never played with before and all
that stuff so i always get super anxious right before the

2808
02:11:39,040 --> 02:11:49,100
collab i know it doesn't look like it like you know fake it
till you make it that's like my whole thing my entire

2809
02:11:49,100 --> 02:11:57,980
streaming career has been majority fake it till you make it
