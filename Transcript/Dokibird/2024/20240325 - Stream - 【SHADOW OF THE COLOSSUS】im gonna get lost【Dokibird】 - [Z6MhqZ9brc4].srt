1
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:49,740
Hey, buddy!

2
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,680
Hello, guys!

3
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,600
I'm so excited.

4
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:57,960
I know, this is, like, a super rare Sunday stream.

5
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:06,000
I figured since, you know, I took an extra rest day
yesterday, I was like, ah, fuck it.

6
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:06,540
Let's do it.

7
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:07,460
Let's do a Sunday stream.

8
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:08,560
It's very rare.

9
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,580
It's very rare of me to do a Sunday stream.

10
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:15,420
But, like, I took, like, an extra rest day last week, so I'm
just like, you know what?

11
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,940
Let's spoil the dragoons a little bit today.

12
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:27,580
You might be noticing lately that like I've been posting
schedules a lot earlier than I used to in the past.

13
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:40,040
If you're a new fan in the past, sometimes I will post my
schedules on like Tuesday or like Monday or something.

14
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,800
But lately, yes, I've been posting my schedules a lot
earlier.

15
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:50,340
That is because it is a lot easier to figure out what to
play now.

16
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,220
I don't really have to wait on anything.

17
00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:02,140
So other than like collabs, I guess, collabs is like the
only thing that I have to actually like wait for for

18
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:02,700
confirmation.

19
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:09,560
But usually I ask about collab for like really early on
before like the week is over.

20
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:13,100
So like I would know what the collabs are for next week,
stuff like that.

21
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:14,780
Because I already do have like some stuff.

22
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:21,600
some collabs planned for next week um like things like that
like i i try to plan early for collabs so that's why i've

23
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:28,820
been posting my schedules a lot earlier than usual um i hope
i will be able to keep that up uh wait thank you for the

24
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:34,880
super chat thank you thank you hey dokey can i get a
birthday wish for my birthday today happy birthday happy

25
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:48,980
birthday to you happy birthday to you happy But yeah,
anyway, Shadow of Colossus, this is actually a game that

26
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:52,080
I've been meaning to play for a very, very, very, very,
very, very, very, very, very long time.

27
00:04:53,360 --> 00:05:04,060
I sort of know what this game is about because my very first
time watching this playthrough was years, years, years,

28
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,840
years, years ago on the Game Grumps.

29
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:11,400
Oh my gosh, if I ever get a collab with the Game Grumps, it
would be a fucking dream come true.

30
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,100
Is that Eagle Raptor?

31
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:21,980
Anyway, I don't think he likes being called Eagle Raptor
anymore.

32
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,560
I think Aaron wants to be called Aaron.

33
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:35,980
But like, anyway, anyway, anyway, I've actually, that was
like the first time I've watched.

34
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:43,200
Bro, you know, he's like, I, okay, you know, he's like,
okay, I feel like saying this would like be, he'll be like,

35
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,760
yeah, I'm not going to collab with this bitch.

36
00:05:44,780 --> 00:06:03,140
bro bro do you know aaron is like 37 now i i oh my god i
feel old now knowing that aaron is like he's almost 40 i was

37
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:15,280
like what no they're supposed to be like in their 20s
forever i can't believe it time so shut up shut up Shut up,

38
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,100
shut up!

39
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:23,460
Oh my god, I can't believe it.

40
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,240
He's almost, fuck it, he's almost 40.

41
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:33,620
I, oh my god, I feel like, I always feel like Game Grumps is
always, like, in their 20s forever.

42
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:39,900
Like, they'll be, they'll be in their 20s forever, but he's,
it just blew my mind.

43
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,820
It actually, it actually blew my mind that he's 37 now.

44
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,200
Stop talking!

45
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,240
Shut up, shut up!

46
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,120
Stop talking!

47
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:48,960
Shut up!

48
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:49,540
Shut up!

49
00:06:53,160 --> 00:07:02,420
Anyway, anyway, um, but yes, uh, the very first time I've
ever watched this playthrough was via Game Grumps, and it

50
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:08,000
seemed like a game that I've always really wanted to play,
and I've always actually played, I'm trying to remember the

51
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,880
developer of Shadow Colossus.

52
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:13,020
Who are the developers of Shadow the Colossus?

53
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:20,220
I talked about, I told a story before, but, uh, well, Team
Eco or ICO.

54
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,600
I don't know if it's Eco or ICO.

55
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:31,020
Um, but, uh, basically, the, the only game I've ever played
from them was the one regarding, like, the shadow people.

56
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,160
God, what was that game called?

57
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:39,080
I did, I was, like, so young when I played that game,
because I always saw it, saw, like, demos of it.

58
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,320
You could play the demo of it.

59
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,920
And then I was like, oh my God, dad, buy this game for me.

60
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:54,820
demo looks so fucking cool and then i bought the game and
then oh it's the same it is also eco okay it's also it's

61
00:07:54,820 --> 00:08:03,980
also eco okay anyway and the thing is i was a really stupid
kid and i'm a very stupid adult too so like you know at

62
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:12,700
least it's like at least i'm consistent uh you know at least
at least i'm consistent in terms of like how this goes but

63
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:21,240
basically as a kid i was really fucking um never didn't
change at all uh anyway but uh I try to play it I bought the

64
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:27,540
game and I try to play it I had no idea what the fuck I was
doing because these games there's no actual instructions

65
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:37,060
it's all about using like like context clues and being
intuitive but like I didn't have that as a kid I still don't

66
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:40,460
have that as an adult I think I was just born wrong um but

67
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:50,860
know what the fuck to do because all i could remember was
just running around and slapping people with a wooden sword

68
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:57,200
and i didn't know what to do i was so fucking frustrated i
spent hours trying to i like when i bought the game i spent

69
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:03,680
like hours uh like trying to play the game trying to figure
out what to do and i was just running around as this little

70
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:09,220
kid fucking whacking shadow people with a wooden sword and i
was so fucking frustrated i was like why do i have a wooden

71
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:09,800
sword.

72
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,740
Where are the real weapons?

73
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,280
Where's the princess?

74
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,420
And then I stopped after that.

75
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:21,020
I literally played a couple of hours one day and then I
never touched a game again.

76
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,520
I never touched a game again after that.

77
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:32,420
And that was my only experience playing their games.

78
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:35,140
And I never played any other games that they made.

79
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,880
Oh no, that's a lie.

80
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,080
I played the Guardian.

81
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,580
It was also, like, when it came out, it was a beautiful
game.

82
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:46,720
But, like, I think I also played for one day.

83
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,900
I played for one day.

84
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,460
Because I think I got stuck in an area.

85
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:59,320
Because, like I said, these games, it's all about being able
to figure stuff out yourself.

86
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:03,920
And then, so, like, I must have been stuck somewhere.

87
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:08,640
Because I got so fucking frustrated that I stopped playing
after one day.

88
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:22,740
so I am consistent throughout this and because of this but I
saw you know I saw other game girls playing it and it seemed

89
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:33,000
really fun so I was like you know what maybe this time it
will be different because this time I have chat to yell at

90
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:44,840
me if I get lost because I know for this game really depends
on like how many um it really depends on where you know what

91
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:50,960
to do like what where you have to go type deal because if
you know where to go this game is like two to three hours

92
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:57,480
because you're just going a destination destination
destination if you don't know where to go like me it can be

93
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:09,720
a very long game so it really depends on like how this is
gonna go if i'm gonna find and shit like that.

94
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:14,680
If I'm going to find the big scary monsters that I have to
kill.

95
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,900
Because it's all about trying to find the big scary
monsters.

96
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:19,160
I have no idea.

97
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,680
Like, obviously people...

98
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,960
I think the internet...

99
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,940
Yeah, forums existed.

100
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:26,720
But, like, I'm pretty sure this game had a fucking game
guide.

101
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,820
I am so 100% sure.

102
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,680
There has to be a game guide for this.

103
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:34,040
Because, like, how the fuck were people able to figure out
where they go?

104
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,480
Like, how the fuck were people...

105
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:46,060
able to figure this out oh yeah and the lizards oh i forgot
about the lizards apparently i have to beat up some lizards

106
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:55,040
too oh my god for like extra health or something i don't
know i don't remember i i don't remember from the uh all my

107
00:11:55,040 --> 00:12:04,120
all the knowledge i have is just from like just sort of
remembering from never on game grounds yeah anyway oh to

108
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:13,000
upgrade my stamina yeah okay this is gonna hope you guys
don't hate me too much for ruining this game for you guys.

109
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,640
I hope you guys don't hate me that much.

110
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,100
Also, is my sound guy here today?

111
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,140
Ooh, photo mode.

112
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:23,820
Hell yeah.

113
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,060
Let's do photo mode.

114
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,500
Cinematic mode, performance mode, midnight mode.

115
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:30,100
I don't know.

116
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:31,060
We'll just do that.

117
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:31,980
That seems fine.

118
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,240
Um, I don't know.

119
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,400
My sound guy is alive right now.

120
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,720

00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,400
What did I do?

157
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:12,480
Moon, thank you for the first super chat to call me a nerd.

158
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,640
What the fuck did I do?

159
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:21,070
You see, to be a nerd, you have to be smart.

160
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,340
There's no way the graphics are worse than the original PS2.

161
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,540
There's no fucking way.

162
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:55,960
like fucking nostalgia glasses on if you think if you think
the original had better graphics there's no fucking way the

163
00:16:55,960 --> 00:17:03,500
ps2 graphics it's like going back you're like oh yeah that
was the best fucking game i've ever played back in the ps2

164
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:13,560
era and you were playing now and you're like it was just
nothing better to do all

165
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:22,640
right settings audio Look, the PS2 was great.

166
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,420
I would admit, I love the PS2.

167
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:30,400
But you have to admit that there's a lot of nostalgia factor
going into the PS2.

168
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,160
Okay, nice, show tutorial.

169
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,240
That's what I need.

170
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:35,380
Uh...

171
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:37,980
It controls audio.

172
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,380
I think that's good, right?

173
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:41,120
Yeah.

174
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,840
We should be good now.

175
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,340
No, of course there's no motion blur.

176
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,620
But what would the hard version be?

177
00:17:54,360 --> 00:18:06,420
they'll be harder to find like like what's the hard version
gonna be will they be like harder to find how do you make

178
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:15,260
this harder oh yeah instead of like in this open area you
gotta go to like all the way to the end of the map and then

179
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:26,100
you're gonna find this one stone and you have to make sure
you hit that one stone to be able to be To be able to get

180
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:26,620
there.

181
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,200
And then the boss will show up.

182
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,860
But then, when the boss shows up, that's not when you engage
the fight.

183
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:36,400
Because after that, you have to find the third stone.

184
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,520
That's, like, on the other side of the map.

185
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,320
And then you hit that third stone.

186
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,680
And then you go back to the second stone.

187
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:43,960
And then he'll show.

188
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,240
And then he'll show up.

189
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:50,680
That is the hard mode.

190
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:54,080
It looks almost like you just get less stamina.

191
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,000
Oh, okay.

192
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,440
Because someone was like, Doki, you just get less stamina.

193
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:15,600
Well, when I find my princess.

194
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,460
The hard version.

195
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:28,660
It's more cutscenes because you find out their backstory and
then you take emotional damage on top of it.

196
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,740
Here's my dead princess.

197
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:04,900
God, the soundtrack is actually beautiful, though.

198
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,580
And it's actually...

199
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,680
She's half dead.

200
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:15,780
I, like, think, like, who's feeding this woman while I'm,
like, you know, trying to find the bosses?

201
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,620
Sorry, video game logic.

202
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:28,600
I'm, like, so spoiled, not spoiled, but I'm so corrupted by
video game realism in the, like, current times.

203
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:31,500
Because everything has to be super duper fucking realistic.

204
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,680
now when it comes to video games.

205
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:38,200
So now I'm wondering, what the fuck is like, it's like she's
in a coma, right?

206
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:43,800
So when you're in a coma you have to like make sure they
don't get bed sores, which is basically if the skin has too

207
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,740
much pressure, it starts like breaking apart.

208
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:50,180
And I'm going to be gone for a long time.

209
00:20:55,220 --> 00:21:05,400
Who's gonna bathe her and feed her and make shit she's like
turn around oh she's actually dead dead

210
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:21,240
you so you little cock i use the you're called a lawyer

211
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:47,500
I wonder if that's a real language or he was they were just
like just go wild man

212
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,340
Well, the Sims language is an actual language.

213
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:58,980
I've shown it before, but the Sims is an actual real
language.

214
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:05,940
I'm just wondering if they, when they told a voice actor to,
like, read this, if they were, like, just fucking go wild,

215
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:06,200
man.

216
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:06,700
I don't know.

217
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:08,920
It's just like, no, no.

218
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,460
Yeah, it is.

219
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,640
If you, like, there's, like, it's called Simlish.

220
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:16,820
Simlish or something.

221
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,520
And then there's, like, actual songs.

222
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:21,220
Wait, you guys don't know about.

223
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,020
Simlish?

224
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:26,680
Okay, after I kill these shadow people, I need you guys to
listen to Simlish.

225
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:27,920
It's actually crazy.

226
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:31,040
Because, like, they've had, like, real songs.

227
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:38,340
They've had real... I don't... Okay, I might get
demonetized, but, like... They've had real songs translated

228
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:41,720
into Simlish, and they got, like, the actual rights off of
it.

229
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,920
It's the best language.

230
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:47,380
Okay.

231
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:52,720
I'll show you guys after the show you in the super chat
reading.

232
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:53,720
We're gonna do super chat reading.

233
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:55,300
We're gonna do super chat reading today.

234
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,060
I'll show you in super chat reading.

235
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,300
It's actually crazy.

236
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:02,940
All right.

237
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,220
All right, princess.

238
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:07,560
Apparently you're actually dead dead and you're not in a
coma.

239
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:11,040
I got one guide because somebody was like, oh no, she's like
not.

240
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:11,860
She's half dead.

241
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:15,200
This is why you are a jerk.

242
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:16,880
Shake my head.

257
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,140
What makes her special?

258
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,940
There's so much fish in the sea, Dormen.

259
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,860
Why is she special?

260
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:49,840
Is it because she's a princess and you want to inherit her
throne?

261
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:56,280
She is real to me.

262
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:01,940

Oh my god, it's too real!

Jesus Christ, it's way too real.

I'm just gonna look at the sky.

319
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,060

320
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:24,760
Stop.

321
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,940

00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:32,200

541
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:03,450
It's like a little poke, a little head pat.

542
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:05,610
Guys, it's just a little head pat.

543
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:07,770
Nothing to worry about.

544
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:09,190
See, he likes it.

545
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:12,830

546
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:15,130

573
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:44,180
Alright, here you go.

We got the first boss!

590
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:10,510
That's so easy.

591
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:19,600
Oh, is that him?

592
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:21,860
He's a happy customer.

593
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:26,020
He came back to wish me a well-good job.

594
00:43:38,270 --> 00:43:39,950
No, it's like a happy customer.

595
00:43:41,130 --> 00:43:42,290
It's like, good job, Doki.

596
00:43:43,990 --> 00:43:46,410
I was so stressed out and now I feel relieved.

597
00:43:49,410 --> 00:43:51,350
He's leaving a Google review.

598
00:43:51,430 --> 00:43:51,990
Yeah.

599
00:43:53,830 --> 00:43:56,090
That's like Google review right there.

600
00:43:58,830 --> 00:44:02,790
Yeah, it must be a good thing you're doing because of all
the black spirits.

601
00:44:04,670 --> 00:44:05,410
It's like oil.

602
00:44:05,650 --> 00:44:07,110
That's why it's black.

603
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:12,900
Look at that.

604
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:14,900
He was so happy.

605
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,200
He was so happy.

606
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:19,560
He like gave me more space.

607
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:23,060
That's the tip.

608
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:32,280
It's my next bow.

609
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:36,120
Oh, I can move the camera.

610
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:39,020
Oh, it's the water.

611
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:45,120
That's like a house upgrade.

612
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:49,140
You know, like, in Animal Crossing, where your house gets
bigger?

613
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:52,120
Now I have more space to put my storage cabinet.

614
00:44:56,620 --> 00:44:57,040
Nice.

615
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:58,620
Argo, are you back?

616
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:08,360
Guys, I figure out how to play the game all right our next
step is to find the fucking salamander argo you came back

617
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:16,040
and you figure out how to ride this horse okay i think this
is like the hardest part of the game

618
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:23,980
this is actually this is actually the hardest part

619
00:45:30,730 --> 00:45:33,770
That should have found an altar similar to this one.

620
00:45:36,450 --> 00:45:37,550
Wait, I'm injured?

621
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:42,200
What do you mean?

622
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:43,180
I thought there's no falls.

623
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:45,280
There's fall damage in this game?

624
00:45:46,060 --> 00:45:47,280
What hurt me?

625
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,240
There's no way.

626
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:50,380
Am I actually injured?

627
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:52,080
I can't tell.

628
00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:53,560
There's no bars or anything.

629
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:56,660
Hello.

630
00:45:58,120 --> 00:45:58,900

631
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:02,300
Oh, it's a save station.

632
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:03,320
Hello.

633
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:04,860

641
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,560
Pray to save.

642
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:27,120
Here we go.

643
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:27,960
I figured it out.

644
00:46:28,540 --> 00:46:29,260
Pray to save.

645
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:30,360

00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:18,280
Argo, please!

658
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:21,060
I keep pressing X to ride the horse.

659
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:22,680
But it's triangle.

660
00:47:24,020 --> 00:47:24,460

666
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:37,980

Behind here.

674
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:56,040
Because why would it take me here?

675
00:47:56,580 --> 00:47:58,060

Well, time to find out.

699
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:48,720
Go!

700
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:50,740
Go!

701
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:51,220
Go!

702
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:54,060
If you...

703
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:55,140
I'm not afraid.

704
00:48:56,060 --> 00:48:56,900
I'm not...

705
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:58,460
What are you afraid of?

706
00:48:58,600 --> 00:48:59,460
It's water!

707
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:02,140
Yeah.

708
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:07,660
Hey, I think I'm dead.

709
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:12,660
Wait, am I...

710
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:19,660
Guys, I think...

711
00:49:22,330 --> 00:49:25,270
I like how...

712
00:49:25,270 --> 00:49:27,190
Okay, I like that.

713
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:31,530
It's not...

714
00:49:31,530 --> 00:49:32,290
It's not here.

715
00:49:32,310 --> 00:49:35,330
even a splash there's like

716
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:44,670
there's like there's like i don't even sink down it just
like i just

717
00:49:48,430 --> 00:50:06,150
oh my god like he doesn't even sink that's the crazy part he
just fucking it was like concrete That is so realistic, not

718
00:50:06,150 --> 00:50:06,630
gonna lie.

719
00:50:06,930 --> 00:50:11,070
It has to be, like, the most realistic water physics ever.

720
00:50:12,110 --> 00:50:13,910
Just like real life.

721
00:50:15,330 --> 00:50:16,270
I don't know.

722
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:18,090
Usually, you know, it's like Minecraft.

723
00:50:18,470 --> 00:50:21,530
When you drop down, like, you don't die from the water.

724
00:50:22,450 --> 00:50:25,670
I thought it'd be like Minecraft, where you can stop the
fall.

725
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:28,930
I realized it was not like Minecraft.

726
00:50:29,310 --> 00:50:30,410
I realized.

727
00:50:33,090 --> 00:50:36,670
Today, I realized it was not like Minecraft.

728
00:50:40,830 --> 00:50:42,830
Okay, how do we get down then?

729
00:50:44,850 --> 00:50:47,250
We have to figure out how to get down.

730
00:50:48,130 --> 00:50:49,690
Because the cave is down there.

731
00:50:50,370 --> 00:50:52,330
Like, it's still water.

732
00:50:52,830 --> 00:50:54,190
It can't be that bad.

733
00:50:55,950 --> 00:50:57,490
No bucket tech.

734
00:50:57,690 --> 00:50:57,890
Yeah.

735
00:50:59,150 --> 00:51:01,350
Where's the bucket tech here?

736
00:51:02,310 --> 00:51:04,190
How the fuck did we get down there?

737
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:09,180
There's a bridge?

738
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:10,460
Oh, there is a bridge.

739
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:14,380
How did I get to the... How did I get to the bridge last
time?

740
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:18,380
It has to be like another bridge here.

741
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:19,680
This one, right?

742
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:22,760
Yeah, this is this bridge.

743
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:24,020
Okay.

744
00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:29,300
Yeah, I know I could climb down, but like...

745
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:31,960
That's not fun.

746
00:51:37,020 --> 00:51:39,300
It's not as fun as falling.

747
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:42,740
It's like the biggest dive board, you know?

748
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:48,320
It's like the biggest fucking diving board.

749
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,540
I mean, if Olympians can do it, why can't I?

750
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:52,360
You know?

751
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:54,300
I mean, did you see...

752
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:54,720
Whoa!

753
00:51:57,220 --> 00:51:58,100
Oh, shit.

754
00:51:58,460 --> 00:51:59,060
Where is that?

755
00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:03,660
I mean, did you not see me climb the fucking Colossus?

756
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:06,840
Let Argo dive.

757
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:08,320
Oh,

758
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:13,040
it's down there.

759
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:13,560
Okay.

760
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:14,900
What dive?

761
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:15,580
I jumped down.

762
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:23,200
So many questions.

763
00:52:23,420 --> 00:52:26,580
I want to know how many ways can I die.

764
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:30,820
Jump, Argo, jump.

765
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:32,380
Alright.

766
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:33,000

Don't worry, sir.

775
00:53:40,750 --> 00:53:42,470
I'm ready to give you some acupuncture.

776
00:53:43,710 --> 00:53:45,950
Alright, there's no sun, so I don't know where your weak
point is.

777
00:53:46,710 --> 00:53:46,710
Sun!

778
00:53:47,950 --> 00:53:49,350
What the fuck is that?

779
00:53:50,070 --> 00:53:50,450
Okay.

780
00:53:51,330 --> 00:53:51,850
Friend.

781
00:53:53,530 --> 00:53:54,310
Where is this?

782
00:53:54,650 --> 00:53:55,830
Okay, it's the head.

783
00:53:56,390 --> 00:53:58,450
Who would have thought it's the head again?

784
00:53:58,930 --> 00:53:59,990
Don't worry, Argyo.

785
00:54:00,670 --> 00:54:02,070
Everything will be fine.

786
00:54:02,170 --> 00:54:04,390
Wait, I think like...

787
00:54:04,390 --> 00:54:05,530
It's like his toe.

788
00:54:06,310 --> 00:54:06,730
Right?

789
00:54:07,970 --> 00:54:09,030
His toe hurt.

790
00:54:10,550 --> 00:54:12,770
Okay, let go of your toe so I can shoot your toe.

791
00:54:15,350 --> 00:54:16,570
Oh, unlucky.

792
00:54:21,350 --> 00:54:23,090
Okay, maybe I'll use that bow.

793
00:54:24,150 --> 00:54:25,390
Don't worry, I'm going to shoot your toe.

794
00:54:27,210 --> 00:54:29,170
Nine out of ten doctors recommend it.

795
00:54:30,190 --> 00:54:30,970
How do I use this?

796
00:54:31,110 --> 00:54:32,570
Okay, shoot toe.

797
00:54:33,650 --> 00:54:35,650
Alright, lift up your toe.

798
00:54:36,570 --> 00:54:37,110
Lift it up.

799
00:54:37,450 --> 00:54:39,130
Wait, how do I shoot this?

800
00:54:41,330 --> 00:54:41,970

801
00:54:41,970 --> 00:54:42,490
How do I...

802
00:54:43,850 --> 00:54:44,850
Am I stupid?

803
00:54:45,430 --> 00:54:46,530
Oh, I just let go.

804
00:54:46,710 --> 00:54:47,450
Okay, let go.

Yeah.

813
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:04,720
Am I hitting it?

814
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:08,540
I don't even know.

815
00:55:08,820 --> 00:55:09,560

Welcome to the doki massage parlor.

822
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:15,740
All right.

823
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:18,000
Do we do acupuncture and massage parlor?

824
00:56:18,100 --> 00:56:18,460
Whoa!

825
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:19,580

826
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:25,300
Sir, I know this is your first time, but I come highly
recommended.

827
00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:28,600
Do not worry.

828
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:32,260
Whee-o-o-step!

00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:36,320
Whee-o- Don't worry.

830
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:37,200
Do not worry.

831
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:38,160
This is normal.

832
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:41,780
This is a normal amount of oil to drip out.

833
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:47,460
Very normal amount.

834
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:54,020
Your headache is gonna be gone.

835
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:54,560

836
00:56:56,380 --> 00:56:57,860
I swear, sir.

837
00:56:58,920 --> 00:56:59,580
Don't worry.

838
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:01,920
It's a... I would never lie to you.

839
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:07,680
Getting that pour out, you know?

840
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:09,840
Gotta clean those pores.

841
00:57:10,340 --> 00:57:11,820
Wait, it's not glowing anymore.

842
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:14,700
Where the fuck are you?

843
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:16,260
You're stressed out in more than one area?

844
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:22,900
Sir, where else are you stressed?

845
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:28,860
Paint the target.

846
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:31,000
What the f- Oh, shit!

847
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:31,820
Oh!

848
00:57:34,740 --> 00:57:36,540
Oh, I can't just drop down.

849
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:39,500
Sir, we need to find out where your second pore is.

850
00:57:39,740 --> 00:57:41,620
You gotta let go, man.

851
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:43,200
You gotta take some breaks.

852
00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:43,780
You're not.

853
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:46,600
Unless you're a workaholic, then that's fine.

854
00:57:46,820 --> 00:57:48,660
Is it your nips down there?

855
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:51,420
Is your nips down there?

856
00:57:51,420 --> 00:57:51,880
Hurtie?

857
00:57:56,360 --> 00:57:57,920
Okay, we need to figure it out.

858
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:00,640
Where else is he Hurtie?

859
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:02,500
Where else?

860
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:03,420
Oh, God.

861
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:04,560
Oh, shit.

862
00:58:04,780 --> 00:58:05,220
Okay, okay.

863
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Where is it?

864
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:09,720
Is this bug?

865
00:58:09,740 --> 00:58:11,420
Oh, it's his butt!

866
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:12,940
Oh, say it, don't worry.

867
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:14,980
Don't be embarrassed.

868
00:58:15,580 --> 00:58:19,740
Sometimes, instead of the head, the stress can go to the
ass.

869
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:22,320
And it's not like the flattering type, too.

870
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:23,960
So, like, do not worry.

871
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:25,540
You are not the only one.

872
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:26,700
Don't be embarrassed.

873
00:58:26,900 --> 00:58:27,780
You're not the first...

874
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:29,420
You might be my second client.

875
00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:34,380
So, you are the first client that I have that's stressed out
on the ass.

876
00:58:34,660 --> 00:58:35,780
So, sorry.

877
00:58:40,820 --> 00:58:49,140
actually you are you are my first you are my second client
so in reality you are my first client to be stressed out

878
00:58:49,140 --> 00:58:56,960
down there so but don't be embarrassed i'm pretty sure many

One more hit.

898
00:59:43,020 --> 00:59:43,760
And then...

899
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:44,300
Boop!

900
00:59:51,060 --> 00:59:52,020

908
01:00:15,630 --> 01:00:17,830
Look at him, he's like lying on the ground.

909
01:00:18,190 --> 01:00:19,170
So relaxed.

01:00:24,450 --> 01:00:26,010

922
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:15,160
What is this?

923
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:22,680
The anger of the sleeping giant shatters the earth why are

924
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:37,260

928
01:01:56,260 --> 01:01:56,900
See you guys?

929
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:00,760
See you guys, I've got I conquered journalist mode.

930
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:03,760
Okay, but not the horse mode.

931
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:06,540
The horse mode is still, I'm still having issues with that.

932
01:02:07,660 --> 01:02:15,780
I'm still I'm still having issues with the fucking the
fucking horse.

933
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:19,040
Horse is so hard to ride, who would have thought?

934
01:02:20,140 --> 01:02:20,980
Alright, prey time.

935
01:02:22,180 --> 01:02:22,680
Pray.

936
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:23,780
Pray to save.

937
01:02:27,850 --> 01:02:31,430
Yeah, I said there's a salamander near the shrines.

938
01:02:31,590 --> 01:02:32,510
Is there one near here?

939
01:02:34,410 --> 01:02:36,070
Is there one near here, guys?

940
01:02:36,470 --> 01:02:38,530
Okay, where the fuck is my sword telling me to go?

941
01:02:39,590 --> 01:02:40,090
Sword.

942
01:02:40,350 --> 01:02:41,210
Tell me the way.

943
01:02:42,870 --> 01:02:43,170
Up?

944
01:02:45,310 --> 01:02:45,810
Left?

945
01:02:46,090 --> 01:02:47,090
Okay, left.

946
01:02:47,970 --> 01:02:48,890
Not here.

947
01:02:49,590 --> 01:02:49,970
Alright.

948
01:02:51,930 --> 01:02:53,370
Alright, we're gonna figure this out.

949
01:02:54,350 --> 01:02:55,430
Alright, let's go.

950
01:02:56,110 --> 01:02:57,050
The third boss.

951
01:02:57,310 --> 01:02:58,350
We're at a record!

952
01:03:00,210 --> 01:03:01,790
Guys, we're already at number three.

953
01:03:02,150 --> 01:03:04,510
You know, I had very low expectations for myself.

954
01:03:05,210 --> 01:03:10,010
I honestly thought I would get, like, one boss throughout
this entire run.

955
01:03:10,610 --> 01:03:13,570
But now, this way, okay, but now I got two.

956
01:03:14,030 --> 01:03:15,610
That's already really, really good.

957
01:03:20,770 --> 01:03:23,310
It's really good for us.

958
01:03:23,930 --> 01:03:25,810
Alright, now we just gotta figure out...

959
01:03:25,810 --> 01:03:27,950
Why are there no other people here in this world?

960
01:03:28,150 --> 01:03:28,990
Where am I?

961
01:03:29,830 --> 01:03:31,330
Where are the people, though?

962
01:03:32,250 --> 01:03:34,410
Let's be, like, across, I think.

963
01:03:36,550 --> 01:03:38,530
Yeah, we've already exceeded expectations.

964
01:03:38,710 --> 01:03:40,170
We've doubled our expectations.

965
01:03:40,970 --> 01:03:44,190
I thought I'm gonna spend, like, two plus hours trying to
find one guy.

966
01:03:44,910 --> 01:03:50,530
In the end, in the end, we struggled with the controls at
first, but we're getting better.

967
01:03:50,950 --> 01:03:53,090
And we own a successful massage parlor.

968

01:04:59,250 --> 01:04:59,910
Oh my god.

975
01:04:59,990 --> 01:05:00,810
Yeah, that's what I do.

976
01:05:01,370 --> 01:05:06,650
I don't have a license for it because like, I'm just
naturally talented.

977
01:05:07,310 --> 01:05:10,610
And like, if you're naturally talented in these things, you
don't need a license.

978
01:05:12,450 --> 01:05:14,090
It's all word of mouth, you know.

979
01:05:15,470 --> 01:05:16,490
Okay, where do I go?

980
01:05:16,630 --> 01:05:17,030
It's this way.

981
01:05:17,310 --> 01:05:17,550
Okay.

982
01:05:21,090 --> 01:05:21,910
Wait, what?

983
01:05:22,130 --> 01:05:22,890
Where is it?

984
01:05:24,650 --> 01:05:25,890
Am I in the wrong way?

985
01:05:26,110 --> 01:05:27,110
Am I lost now?

986
01:05:31,370 --> 01:05:32,610
Okay, oh, it's this way.

987
01:05:32,690 --> 01:05:34,670
Okay, we gotta figure out how to get across.

988
01:05:36,810 --> 01:05:37,870
Okay, from here.

989
01:05:38,150 --> 01:05:39,010
This is how you get across.

990
01:05:40,810 --> 01:05:42,510
Oh, yeah, we have a map!

991
01:05:44,330 --> 01:05:45,570
What the fuck is that skull?

992
01:05:45,690 --> 01:05:48,310
Oh, that's where we killed the Colossus.

993
01:05:49,190 --> 01:05:50,150
We have a map.

994
01:05:53,250 --> 01:05:53,970
We figured... Oh, wait.

995
01:05:54,030 --> 01:05:54,750
Is this a shrine?

996
01:05:55,530 --> 01:05:56,470
This has to be a shrine.

997
01:05:57,390 --> 01:05:57,890
Time to pray.

998
01:05:59,450 --> 01:06:00,430
Pray to save.

999
01:06:01,930 --> 01:06:02,230
Pray.

1000
01:06:04,010 --> 01:06:04,330
Hoop.

1001
01:06:05,230 --> 01:06:05,530
Yay!

1002
01:06:07,450 --> 01:06:08,270
Is there a lizard?

1003
01:06:08,950 --> 01:06:09,610
A salamander?

1004
01:06:10,430 --> 01:06:11,530
What do they look like?

1005
01:06:13,650 --> 01:06:14,990
What does salamander...

1006
01:06:14,990 --> 01:06:15,790
Wait, is that salamander?

1007
01:06:15,850 --> 01:06:16,710
No, that's just grass.

1008
01:06:17,350 --> 01:06:18,270
What do they look like?

1009
01:06:19,550 --> 01:06:21,290
I don't... I don't remember what they look like.

1010
01:06:21,710 --> 01:06:22,710
How tiny are they?

1011
01:06:22,710 --> 01:06:23,230
Are they big?

1012
01:06:23,250 --> 01:06:24,370
What?

1013
01:06:24,950 --> 01:06:27,210
They look like a lizard.

1014
01:06:27,830 --> 01:06:29,930
Yeah, but like, are they big?

1015
01:06:30,110 --> 01:06:30,750
Are they small?

1016
01:06:31,190 --> 01:06:32,370
What color?

1017
01:06:33,830 --> 01:06:34,570
White tail.

1018
01:06:34,710 --> 01:06:35,170
Oh, yes.

1019
01:06:35,670 --> 01:06:35,870
On.

1020
01:06:36,310 --> 01:06:36,570
Let's.

1021
01:06:36,930 --> 01:06:39,970
Yes, the white tail on these white rocks.

1022
01:06:40,550 --> 01:06:42,210
So easy to find.

1023
01:06:43,430 --> 01:06:44,710
They can climb?

1024
01:06:45,250 --> 01:06:46,830
Who taught these lizards how to climb?

1025
01:06:47,770 --> 01:06:48,030
Okay.

1026
01:06:48,430 --> 01:06:49,070
Let's see.

1027
01:06:50,070 --> 01:06:50,410
All right.

1028
01:06:50,450 --> 01:06:52,310
I can climb too little do they know.

1029
01:06:53,250 --> 01:06:54,450
I need to figure out.

1030
01:06:54,670 --> 01:06:55,670
Little do they know.

1031
01:06:56,330 --> 01:06:57,210
Oh, I see him!

1032
01:06:58,110 --> 01:06:58,970
Hello, buddy.

1033
01:06:59,290 --> 01:07:00,110
I see you.

1034
01:07:00,290 --> 01:07:00,670
Bro!

1035
01:07:00,810 --> 01:07:01,150
Stop!

1036
01:07:04,250 --> 01:07:05,270
Okay, I see him.

1037
01:07:06,330 --> 01:07:06,730
Oh, no.

1038
01:07:06,850 --> 01:07:07,950
What can I grasp?

1039
01:07:08,770 --> 01:07:09,450
God damn it.

1040
01:07:09,630 --> 01:07:11,110
I need to figure out why I can climb.

1041
01:07:12,650 --> 01:07:13,770
Oh, my God.

1042
01:07:13,910 --> 01:07:14,290
Please.

1043
01:07:14,930 --> 01:07:17,150
I don't even know what this guy's name is.

1044
01:07:17,910 --> 01:07:20,230
I know my horse name, but not him.

1045
01:07:20,310 --> 01:07:20,910
I see him.

1046
01:07:21,070 --> 01:07:22,630
I know what they look like now.

1047
01:07:24,790 --> 01:07:26,090
Oh my god.

1048
01:07:26,650 --> 01:07:28,690
Those little fucking pew pew pew sounds.

1049
01:07:30,330 --> 01:07:31,990
How do I climb up?

1050
01:07:32,930 --> 01:07:33,630
Oh, there it is.

1051
01:07:34,110 --> 01:07:34,970
I see you.

1052
01:07:35,230 --> 01:07:36,470
I see you up there.

1053
01:07:36,930 --> 01:07:37,970
Can't escape from me.

1054
01:07:39,010 --> 01:07:39,970
I need your stamina.

1055
01:07:41,090 --> 01:07:42,150
It's for my business.

1056
01:07:43,210 --> 01:07:44,830
I need to grow a healthy business.

1057
01:07:46,250 --> 01:07:47,070
Come on, I see you.

1058
01:07:47,350 --> 01:07:47,610
Whoop.

1059
01:07:48,550 --> 01:07:48,970
Whoop.

1060
01:07:49,730 --> 01:07:50,310
Is that it?

1061
01:07:52,010 --> 01:07:52,370
Oh!

1062
01:07:53,250 --> 01:07:55,190
I thought you were dead!

1063
01:07:57,830 --> 01:07:59,530
Please, come back.

1064
01:07:59,930 --> 01:08:00,630
You always come.

1065
01:08:00,830 --> 01:08:01,730
That's looking right.

1066
01:08:02,490 --> 01:08:02,690
Boop.

1067
01:08:03,290 --> 01:08:03,810
Wait, what?

1068
01:08:04,030 --> 01:08:05,190
How's that not a hit?

1069
01:08:07,630 --> 01:08:08,150
Boop.

1070
01:08:08,790 --> 01:08:09,250
There you go.

1071
01:08:09,890 --> 01:08:10,410
Boop.

1072
01:08:11,190 --> 01:08:11,670
Are you dead?

1073
01:08:12,370 --> 01:08:13,450
Are you dead dead?

1074
01:08:13,790 --> 01:08:14,690
Okay, double tap.

1075
01:08:15,110 --> 01:08:16,170
Just to be sure.

1076
01:08:16,790 --> 01:08:17,430
There you go.

1077
01:08:18,870 --> 01:08:20,190
Is it stuck in the wall?

1078
01:08:20,870 --> 01:08:21,790
I swear...

1079
01:08:21,790 --> 01:08:23,150
Are you stuck in the wall?

1080
01:08:23,250 --> 01:08:24,250
Are you?

1081
01:08:25,130 --> 01:08:25,750
Are you st-

1082
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:34,760
How do I get it?

1083
01:08:35,760 --> 01:08:37,340
Oh, thank god, okay.

1084
01:08:37,820 --> 01:08:41,020
I thought he was actually stuck in the wall.

1085
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:44,660
It's gonna be so fucking sad.

1086
01:08:45,180 --> 01:08:46,480
Oh, my god.

1087
01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:49,820
Guys, it's okay.

1088
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:51,380
He was not stuck in the wall.

1089
01:08:54,500 --> 01:08:55,500
Okay, nice.

1090
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:56,360
We got the stamina.

1091
01:08:56,980 --> 01:08:58,220
I should be okay.

1092
01:08:59,000 --> 01:08:59,340
Yay!

1093
01:09:00,740 --> 01:09:01,640
I was not okay.

1094
01:09:02,020 --> 01:09:02,320
It's okay.

1095
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:02,580
Pray.

1096
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:04,180
Pray to save.

1097
01:09:06,460 --> 01:09:07,000
Nice.

1098
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:08,180
We're fine.

1099
01:09:09,740 --> 01:09:10,280
I don't know.

1100
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:12,260
I thought I thought I would just...

1101
01:09:12,260 --> 01:09:19,900
I thought I would just walk over it and, and, like, and,
like, the lizard is... The lizard tail is just gonna

1102
01:09:19,900 --> 01:09:20,820
disappear.

1103
01:09:21,180 --> 01:09:23,940
Like, underneath my feet because I picked it up.

1104
01:09:25,940 --> 01:09:26,420
Has to be a...

1105
01:09:26,440 --> 01:09:36,560
here oops it's nice to know of unlimited arrows it has to be
here there's like a really weird there's like a really weird

1106
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:39,250
tunnel here so where else would the giant be

1107
01:09:42,940 --> 01:09:51,860
all right look i got spoiled by modern games okay they they
modern games today they fucking feed you from the bottle

1108
01:09:51,860 --> 01:09:55,800
because they're scared they're gonna we're gonna hurt
ourselves Which is very true.

1109
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:04,140
Like, modern games today, they don't want us to hurt
ourselves.

1110
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:10,840
So, like, I'm not used to having to figure this out myself.

1111
01:10:12,280 --> 01:10:15,320
Like, you know, because they're scared.

1112
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:17,840
They're scared if, like, you're frustrated at a game.

1113
01:10:17,940 --> 01:10:19,160
You won't play anymore.

1114
01:10:19,580 --> 01:10:20,880
Because it's too hard.

1115
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:23,480
Because I've done that as a child.

1116
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:27,120
They're scared, and it's understandable.

1117
01:10:30,700 --> 01:10:31,160
Alright, nice.

1118
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:32,800
This has to be a lake, right?

1119
01:10:35,950 --> 01:10:36,930
Are we there?

1120
01:10:37,310 --> 01:10:38,150
Did I fuck up?

1121
01:10:39,590 --> 01:10:40,610
Did I go the wrong way?

1122
01:10:42,290 --> 01:10:43,170
Where's the sun?

1123
01:10:44,470 --> 01:10:45,850
Where the fuck is the sun?

1124
01:10:47,730 --> 01:10:50,810
Sun, shine on my sword so I know where to go.

1125
01:10:51,470 --> 01:10:51,950
Sun!

1126
01:10:52,410 --> 01:10:53,710
Okay, sun.

1127
01:10:54,990 --> 01:10:55,550
Sun.

1128
01:10:55,570 --> 01:10:55,950
Sun.

1129
01:10:58,370 --> 01:10:58,890
Alright.

1130
01:10:59,630 --> 01:11:01,790
Sun says...

1131
01:11:01,790 --> 01:11:03,910
Where does the sun say?

1132
01:11:05,230 --> 01:11:05,490
Where?

1133
01:11:07,530 --> 01:11:08,050
Sun.

1134
01:11:08,430 --> 01:11:09,010
Where do I...

1135
01:11:09,010 --> 01:11:09,130
Oh.

1136
01:11:09,530 --> 01:11:09,770
Here.

1137
01:11:10,510 --> 01:11:10,950
Here!

1138
01:11:11,170 --> 01:11:11,690
Oh, okay.

1139
01:11:11,790 --> 01:11:12,230
This way.

1140
01:11:13,050 --> 01:11:13,650
We're good.

1141
01:11:15,610 --> 01:11:16,290
We're good.

1142
01:11:16,390 --> 01:11:16,930
It's this way.

1143
01:11:18,630 --> 01:11:18,930
Okay.

1144
01:11:20,110 --> 01:11:21,490
I ran past a lizard?

1145
01:11:21,650 --> 01:11:22,570
Oh, no, that's not good.

1146
01:11:23,130 --> 01:11:24,890
Was it in the little tiny cavern?

1147
01:11:27,290 --> 01:11:28,550
Was it in here?

1148
01:11:29,070 --> 01:11:30,450
A little tiny cavern in here?

1149
01:11:35,460 --> 01:11:36,300
Praise the sun.

1150
01:11:37,580 --> 01:11:37,740
Lizard?

1151
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:40,080
Lizard, where are you?

1152
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:43,780
I need to eat your tail for stamina.

1153
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:46,260
Okay.

1154
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:48,120
Don't worry, I can hear.

1155
01:11:48,360 --> 01:11:49,300
I can hear his little feet.

1156
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:52,280
I have my fucking bow.

1157
01:11:54,620 --> 01:11:55,640
What's your little feet?

1158
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:58,760
Where are you?

1159
01:12:00,740 --> 01:12:01,920
Where are you, lizard?

1160
01:12:03,060 --> 01:12:03,460
Please.

1161
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:06,080
I'm gonna eat your tail.

1162
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:08,060
It apparently helps my stamina.

1163
01:12:09,100 --> 01:12:09,720
Oh, is that the lizard?

1164
01:12:09,940 --> 01:12:10,980
No, that's just a rock.

1165
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:13,030
Where the fuck is it?

1166
01:12:13,940 --> 01:12:14,280
What?

1167
01:12:17,460 --> 01:12:18,620
Argo, please!

1168
01:12:19,260 --> 01:12:19,700
Stop!

1169
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:22,360
Trying to find the lizard!

1170
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:25,440
He's right there.

1171
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:27,980
No, there, Doki.

1172
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,320
He is right there.

1173
01:12:29,740 --> 01:12:31,160
Doki, it's there.

1174
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:32,520
Oh, lizard!

1175
01:12:33,260 --> 01:12:33,660
Oh, God.

1176
01:12:34,620 --> 01:12:34,840
Okay.

1177
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:35,500

Wait, where did he go?

1182
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:45,860
Where did his body go?

1183
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:47,840
Where did...

1184
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:48,520
Where did his butt?

1185
01:12:53,610 --> 01:12:54,090
Wait.

1186
01:12:56,290 --> 01:12:57,430
Oh, that's the tail.

1187
01:12:57,730 --> 01:12:58,330
Is that the tail?

1188
01:12:58,810 --> 01:12:59,410

01:13:39,740 --> 01:13:41,320
I can't believe you guys made me go back.

1193
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:48,220
I can't believe you guys made me go back.

1194
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:50,180
Argo, come over here.

1195
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:53,080
I mean, I can't run properly.

1196
01:13:53,260 --> 01:13:54,160
What's wrong with him?

1197
01:13:54,980 --> 01:13:55,480
What's...

1198
01:13:56,700 --> 01:14:02,000
Ever since I ate that lizard, I haven't been able to run,
right, chat?

1199
01:14:02,420 --> 01:14:02,900
I...

1200
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:10,940
It messed me up.

1201
01:14:14,980 --> 01:14:15,900
My legs.

1202
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:18,160
My legs aren't doing so well.

1203
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:21,440
Argo.

1204
01:14:21,620 --> 01:14:22,000
Argo.

1205
01:14:22,160 --> 01:14:23,440
Argo, come on.

1206
01:14:26,160 --> 01:14:27,380
Argo, come on.

1207
01:14:27,540 --> 01:14:28,140
Where are you?

1208
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:30,580
Argo, come on.

1209
01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:32,220
You're over here.

1210
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:33,580
I know you're faster than me.

1211
01:14:34,140 --> 01:14:34,880
Stop pretending.

1212
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:36,720
Nice.

1213
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:37,280
All right.

1214
01:14:38,020 --> 01:14:39,380
We gotta go kill the third colossal.

1215
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:42,900
I mean, we gotta go to another appointment.

1216
01:14:43,420 --> 01:14:44,820
We got a new client, Argo.

1217
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:48,440
They're mega fucking stressed right now.

1218
01:14:49,540 --> 01:14:53,440
I told you having client base via word of mouth was a good
idea.

1219
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:56,640
We don't have to waste money with stupid advertising.

1220
01:14:57,460 --> 01:15:03,140
As long as we make one client really, really, really happy,
we'll never have to advertise our services.

1221
01:15:04,680 --> 01:15:05,200
Let's go.

1222
01:15:05,940 --> 01:15:25,440

ways to go oh which way oh no oh wait it splits oh no okay

has to be the right way, right?

1225
01:15:44,260 --> 01:15:46,100
There's like shrines and stuff here.

1226
01:15:47,480 --> 01:15:48,180
Is the sun up?

1227
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:49,460
The sun is up.

1228
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:52,540
Okay, where is it telling me to go?

1229
01:15:54,540 --> 01:15:55,020
Backwards.

1230
01:15:55,120 --> 01:15:56,260
All right, I went the wrong way.

1231
01:15:56,640 --> 01:15:57,620
I went the wrong way.

1232
01:16:00,280 --> 01:16:01,580
Wait, is there a shrine?

1233
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:04,520

Guys, I'm just training my horse.

1244
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:51,660
He has to learn how to dodge arrows.

1245
01:17:52,480 --> 01:17:53,620
Okay, save the prey.

1246
01:17:56,700 --> 01:17:57,040
Alright.

Come on.

1249
01:17:59,140 --> 01:17:59,680
I know you're hungry.

1250
01:18:00,820 --> 01:18:01,940
We're all hungry here.

1251
01:18:02,520 --> 01:18:03,780
We gotta save the princess.

1252
01:18:04,940 --> 01:18:06,820
Guys, it's all about like...

1253
01:18:06,820 --> 01:18:08,960
Our horses need a train too, you know?

1254
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:10,420
Like, what if arrows shoot him?

1255
01:18:10,720 --> 01:18:12,140
He's now more prepared.

1256
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:16,300
Penguin, thank you for the super chat, thank you.

1257
01:18:16,760 --> 01:18:19,840
He's now more prepared for, like, warfare.

1258
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:22,280
Okay.

1259
01:18:24,300 --> 01:18:24,940
This way.

1260
01:18:25,860 --> 01:18:27,000
All right, Aria, let's go.

1261
01:18:27,340 --> 01:18:28,600
This has to be the right way, right?

1262
01:18:28,760 --> 01:18:30,060
Oh, my gosh, this is not the sword.

1263
01:18:30,520 --> 01:18:31,700
The fuck is my sword?

1264
01:18:32,600 --> 01:18:32,820
No.

1265
01:18:34,340 --> 01:18:35,460
Look at this way?

1266
01:18:37,820 --> 01:18:40,340
God, this is such a big area.

1267
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:42,340
Maybe here?

1268
01:18:42,820 --> 01:18:43,940
Maybe to the right?

1269
01:18:46,920 --> 01:18:48,480
Don't worry, there's a sun right here.

1270
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:49,700
That's gonna show me the way.

1271
01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:52,080
The sun right here.

1272
01:18:53,740 --> 01:18:55,300
Okay, no, Argo, please.

1273
01:18:56,500 --> 01:19:00,020
This one patch of sun will tell me where to go.

1274
01:19:02,940 --> 01:19:03,780
This way?

1275
01:19:04,160 --> 01:19:05,340
How the fuck do I?

1276
01:19:06,020 --> 01:19:07,440
How do I get there?

1277
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:09,980
Where am I?

1278
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:17,320
How do I get there?

1279
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:21,800
Surely I'm going to figure it out.

1280
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:24,800
I'm going to figure this out, guys.

1281
01:19:25,140 --> 01:19:25,300
Climb!

1282
01:19:25,460 --> 01:19:26,800
There's no way I can climb this.

1283
01:19:29,320 --> 01:19:30,460
There has to be.

1284
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:32,540
Okay.

1285
01:19:33,580 --> 01:19:35,100
Oh, you must know where to go.

1286
01:19:37,320 --> 01:19:39,780
There's no way you climb the mountain.

1287
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:41,680
I don't have enough stamina for that.

1288
01:19:41,680 --> 01:19:53,680
there's no fucking way is it here this is water is this
water no this is a desert

1289
01:19:57,760 --> 01:20:20,280
how do I get so lost oh god I didn't doing what's the fuck
is this where the boss is why would there be an open patch

1290
01:20:20,280 --> 01:20:26,560
of area it's the opposite of water

1291
01:20:29,980 --> 01:20:38,300
oh no it yellow and blue look the same okay water might be
like oh there must be water over there

1292
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:51,600
i think i got it i think i'm on the right patch it's like
the biggest beach you're right it's like a beach guys i

1293
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:59,010
think i'm at the beach chat eventually the sand will become
water that's how beaches work

1294
01:21:06,100 --> 01:21:10,820
that's how beaches work the sand turns into water

1295
01:21:14,620 --> 01:21:35,680
where else do you think like water comes from okay I'm
almost there see it's like somewhere here okay as soon as we

1296
01:21:35,680 --> 01:21:52,830
find the water we're good don't worry guys every sand
eventually connects to water that's just basic geology the

1297
01:21:52,830 --> 01:22:09,870
stadium is the sun there has to be water somewhere there's
no way oh god oh god don't worry i go okay here there has to

1298
01:22:09,870 --> 01:22:16,390
be water somewhere there see there's water I fucking knew
it!

1299
01:22:17,950 --> 01:22:18,650
I knew it!

1300
01:22:18,790 --> 01:22:20,110
I knew there was water!

1301
01:22:21,130 --> 01:22:22,810
None of you believed me!

1302
01:22:25,430 --> 01:22:26,850
I knew there was water.

1303
01:22:27,490 --> 01:22:27,670
See?

1304
01:22:29,510 --> 01:22:31,750
Water is like right here!

1305
01:22:34,190 --> 01:22:34,750
Look!

1306
01:22:35,770 --> 01:22:37,730
There's water down here!

1307
01:22:40,430 --> 01:22:41,550
Look, see?

1308
01:22:41,810 --> 01:22:42,410
Water!

1309
01:22:42,970 --> 01:22:44,310
I told you.

1310
01:22:44,870 --> 01:23:06,870
eventually you reach water now where do I go I ran into a
giant circle I don't know where to go I actually I ran into

1311
01:23:06,870 --> 01:23:12,430
a huge circle oh I got back into the Cabrera, I go!

1312
01:23:12,850 --> 01:23:16,770
Back into this tunnel, I go.

1313
01:23:17,770 --> 01:23:20,110
Oh my god, surely this is the right way.

1314
01:23:20,230 --> 01:23:21,230
Maybe this this time.

1315
01:23:21,850 --> 01:23:23,030
I can't get lost this time.

1316
01:23:23,130 --> 01:23:23,970
I'm going one way.

1317
01:23:26,130 --> 01:23:27,810
There's no way I can get lost.

1318
01:23:28,450 --> 01:23:30,570
This is literally like one direction.

1319
01:23:31,790 --> 01:23:33,310
Oh god, I'm so sorry.

1320
01:23:33,910 --> 01:23:36,570
You have a really stupid person.

1321
01:23:36,810 --> 01:23:38,150
That's the right.

1322
01:23:42,710 --> 01:23:47,950
please please okay here we go we're good we did it

1323
01:23:57,760 --> 01:24:11,820
eventually we will find the area we made it we did it arco
we fucking did it can you go in the water oh my god you can

1324
01:24:12,120 --> 01:24:12,720
Whim!

1325
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:14,840
My horse can do anything.

1326
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:17,020
Please.

1327
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:19,280
Go deeper into the water.

1328
01:24:20,020 --> 01:24:21,820
Oh no, is this like a water level?

1329
01:24:23,180 --> 01:24:25,360
Okay, guys, I don't think Argo likes the water.

1330
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:25,880
Bye.

1331
01:24:26,340 --> 01:24:27,700
Do I like the water?

1332
01:24:30,120 --> 01:24:32,160
Okay, I'm fine with the water, too.

1333
01:24:32,780 --> 01:24:33,080
Alright.

1334
01:24:35,080 --> 01:24:36,120
I can dive.

1335
01:24:36,240 --> 01:24:37,200
Ooh, I don't like that.

1336
01:24:37,400 --> 01:24:39,960
I do not like that fact that I can swim like this.

1337
01:24:40,100 --> 01:24:41,360
Can I swim faster?

1338
01:24:42,120 --> 01:24:44,680
Or I'm gonna be, like, super fucking slow forever.

1339
01:24:47,480 --> 01:24:48,000
Alright.

1340
01:24:51,880 --> 01:24:52,980
Watch my stamina.

1341
01:24:53,180 --> 01:24:54,000
My stamina's okay.

1342
01:24:55,140 --> 01:24:57,660
I don't know if I can, like, swim faster.

1343
01:24:59,500 --> 01:25:01,900
Oh, I swim faster if I'm diving?

1344
01:25:02,180 --> 01:25:02,500
Okay.

1345
01:25:03,140 --> 01:25:04,060
That's good to know.

1346
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:05,220
I don't know what happened.

1347
01:25:05,320 --> 01:25:08,460
Ever since I ate that one lizard, I'm super fucking janked
up.

1348
01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:09,560
Like...

1349
01:25:11,900 --> 01:25:12,940
I don't know.

1350
01:25:13,960 --> 01:25:15,280
Don't feel so good.

1351
01:25:18,520 --> 01:25:21,160
He's super janked up right now.

1352
01:25:23,640 --> 01:25:24,520
Where do I go?

1353
01:25:24,940 --> 01:25:27,720
Do I just sit here?

1354
01:25:32,340 --> 01:25:32,820
Okay.

1355
01:25:35,860 --> 01:25:36,820
Oh, shit.

1356
01:25:36,940 --> 01:25:37,360
Okay, wait.

1357
01:25:37,440 --> 01:25:38,600

1358
01:25:39,380 --> 01:25:39,620
Oh.

1359
01:25:45,350 --> 01:25:46,530
Okay, I'm okay.

1360
01:25:46,670 --> 01:25:47,010
I'm okay.

1361
01:25:47,350 --> 01:25:49,350
Okay, I thought I was gonna die.

1362
01:25:49,870 --> 01:25:52,050
And then, because I don't know how to find this place again.

I was gonna be like, please, do not make me move.

1366
01:26:03,490 --> 01:26:12,170
I was gonna be like, please, I really don't want to try to
find this area again.

1367
01:26:12,350 --> 01:26:17,250
Okay, apparently if I dive down, if I dive down...

Is there anywhere else?

1588
01:40:10,050 --> 01:40:11,350
Just your little tummy?

1589
01:40:14,030 --> 01:40:16,150
Oh no, now it has to be the head.

1590
01:40:16,610 --> 01:40:18,370
The head is always like the last spot.

1591
01:40:20,630 --> 01:40:23,830
Up I go Up I go

1592
01:40:27,120 --> 01:40:31,080
No, I don't get up How do I get up without having to worry?

1593
01:40:32,020 --> 01:40:32,260
Do I?

1594
01:40:33,420 --> 01:40:34,860
Do I get up from here?

1595
01:40:36,920 --> 01:40:38,540
From up the fucking...

1596
01:40:38,540 --> 01:40:38,780

1597
01:40:39,860 --> 01:40:40,720
Oh no!

1598
01:40:41,680 --> 01:40:41,720
Oh no!

1599
01:40:43,560 --> 01:40:44,600

01:40:46,360 --> 01:40:47,240
From the arm?

1601
01:40:47,600 --> 01:40:48,120
Oh maybe.

1602
01:40:48,580 --> 01:40:49,620
Okay, two seconds, make it?

1603
01:40:50,200 --> 01:40:50,800
Alright, alright.

1604
01:40:51,020 --> 01:40:52,680
Please stop swinging sir.

1605
01:40:53,280 --> 01:41:01,900
The longer it is the more you have the charge Sir, I do not
feel very good charging you such a high bill, but I will if

1609
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:09,000
All right, don't worry.

1614
01:41:28,220 --> 01:41:29,060
I climb.

1615

Oh, God.

1616

My stamina, though.

01:41:32,880 --> 01:41:33,420
It's fine.

1618
01:41:38,030 --> 01:41:39,690

Don't worry.

01:41:42,430 --> 01:41:43,850
This is the Jokey Bird special.

1622
01:41:43,990 --> 01:41:45,570
Every client requests for it.

1623
01:41:46,930 --> 01:41:47,970
You will be fine.

1624
01:41:48,390 --> 01:41:49,690
It's just a stress oil.

1625
01:41:49,850 --> 01:41:50,670
Nothing to worry about.

1626
01:41:50,730 --> 01:41:51,570
I did not poke.

1627

Another happy client.

1637
01:42:48,860 --> 01:42:52,240
I hope they keep recommending me to future clients.

1638
01:43:00,280 --> 01:43:00,720
Yay!

Look at that!

1641
01:43:07,560 --> 01:43:09,320
Look at all these Google reviews.

1642
01:43:10,200 --> 01:43:11,880
Now I can fit my bed over there.

1643
01:43:17,900 --> 01:43:19,240
Another happy landing.

1644
01:43:23,520 --> 01:43:25,740
Yeah, every single...

1645
01:43:27,080 --> 01:43:27,520
Um...

01:43:27,520 --> 01:43:28,120
Yes, Valky's.

1647
01:43:28,180 --> 01:43:28,760
Think of the Super Chat.

01:43:28,840 --> 01:43:29,000
Thank you.

1649
01:43:29,020 --> 01:43:29,320
Thank you.

1650
01:43:29,620 --> 01:43:31,640
Every single muscle in his body is now relaxed.

1651
01:43:31,860 --> 01:43:32,300
Exactly!

1652
01:43:34,140 --> 01:43:35,340
somebody understands.

1653
01:43:38,120 --> 01:43:39,220
I'm so good at this.

1654
01:43:39,880 --> 01:43:40,780
You're too good at this?

1655
01:43:40,860 --> 01:43:42,120
No, they'll come back, right?

1656
01:43:43,340 --> 01:43:44,980
They'll come back for more.

1657
01:43:45,360 --> 01:43:46,820
No, happy landing.

1658
01:43:47,180 --> 01:43:51,280
When I'm done with that puncher.

1659
01:43:51,740 --> 01:43:54,620
They land on the ground out of happiness.

1660
01:43:57,100 --> 01:43:58,900
But fearful it is not.

1661
01:43:59,520 --> 01:44:10,980
I mean, to be fair, it's called Colossus, so aren't they

1664
01:44:36,580 --> 01:44:38,200
We just live like this now.

1665
01:44:39,180 --> 01:44:41,080
Ever since we ate that bad...

1666
01:44:41,080 --> 01:44:42,100
The bad lizard.

1667
01:44:44,060 --> 01:44:44,780
This way.

1668
01:44:44,920 --> 01:44:45,720
This way.

1669
01:44:45,820 --> 01:44:46,560
Where is this way?

1670
01:44:48,580 --> 01:44:49,120
This way?

1671
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:52,280
I guess it's this way.

1672
01:44:53,060 --> 01:44:54,600
Ever since we ate that bad lizard.

1673
01:44:54,980 --> 01:44:56,220
Life has not been the same.

1674
01:44:57,580 --> 01:44:58,060
Come on.

1675
01:44:58,960 --> 01:45:00,920
Are you so mad at me that shot the arrow?

1676
01:45:01,100 --> 01:45:03,600
You know you need more training with the arrow stuff.

1677
01:45:03,620 --> 01:45:05,500
It's not my fault.

1678
01:45:06,620 --> 01:45:06,960
Arlo.

1679
01:45:10,760 --> 01:45:11,380
Alright, here you go.

1680
01:45:16,040 --> 01:45:18,260
Yeah, no one ever complains.

1681
01:45:18,880 --> 01:45:20,600
Because everyone had a good time.

1682
01:45:21,240 --> 01:45:22,200
This is this way.

1683
01:45:26,650 --> 01:45:27,610
No, if he...

1684
01:45:27,610 --> 01:45:30,230
Okay, no, no, actually horses can hold grudges.

1685
01:45:30,870 --> 01:45:33,810
Like, they actually, like, can fuck you up if they hate you.

1686
01:45:36,190 --> 01:45:38,250
That's why you never stand behind.

1687
01:45:38,270 --> 01:45:45,830
a horse because like they can actually mess you up you can
actually like break your back if the horse does not like you

1688
01:45:45,830 --> 01:45:57,050
but good thing for me idol loves me he loves me because i've

Where am I?

1692
01:46:17,650 --> 01:46:18,670
Is it a turtle?

1693
01:46:19,450 --> 01:46:20,410
Is this a turtle giant?

1694
01:46:20,490 --> 01:46:21,890
Wait, I remember this!

1695
01:46:22,850 --> 01:46:24,190
Wait, I remember this!

1696
01:46:24,730 --> 01:46:25,010
Jump.

1697
01:46:25,410 --> 01:46:26,110
Jump, Arlo.

1698
01:46:26,790 --> 01:46:27,030
Jump.

1699
01:46:27,850 --> 01:46:28,210

1700
01:46:28,250 --> 01:46:28,830

01:46:29,370 --> 01:46:30,210
Okay, yeah, that's...

1702
01:46:30,210 --> 01:46:32,290
Actually, I just realized you cannot jump that.

1703
01:46:35,030 --> 01:46:35,950
Okay, wait.

1704
01:46:35,990 --> 01:46:36,830
But I can.

1705
01:46:37,150 --> 01:46:37,950
Can I jump that?

1706
01:46:38,130 --> 01:46:38,890
I'm not scared.

1707
01:46:41,170 --> 01:46:41,970
Speed run.

1708
01:46:42,510 --> 01:46:42,950
There you go.

1709
01:46:44,310 --> 01:46:45,550
You see, I'm five.

1710
01:46:46,950 --> 01:46:48,070
So smart.

1711
01:46:49,050 --> 01:46:51,010
See, I don't need a journalist's difficulty.

1712
01:46:51,270 --> 01:46:52,530
I just figured it out myself.

1713
01:46:53,750 --> 01:46:55,090
Now, where do I go?

1714
01:46:55,590 --> 01:46:55,770
No.

1715
01:46:59,550 --> 01:47:00,250
Oh, this way.

1716
01:47:03,390 --> 01:47:03,950
Alright.

1717
01:47:07,510 --> 01:47:08,110
This way.

1718
01:47:09,750 --> 01:47:10,730
I'm speedrunning.

1719
01:47:11,250 --> 01:47:11,570
Look at that.

1720
01:47:11,630 --> 01:47:12,930
Three bosses down.

01:48:17,720 --> 01:48:19,220
Wait, is it this guy?

1728
01:48:19,540 --> 01:48:21,000
That has to be the giant, right?

1729
01:48:21,680 --> 01:48:22,740
That has to be him.

1730
01:48:24,440 --> 01:48:28,400
Well, I don't have the sun, so I have to figure out if it's
this guy that, or in the cave I go.

1731
01:48:31,060 --> 01:48:32,200
This is a little oopsie.

1732
01:48:32,340 --> 01:48:33,920
That has to be a colossus.

1733
01:48:33,980 --> 01:48:34,900
Like, look at him.

1734
01:48:38,970 --> 01:48:41,350
Oh my god, it's like a Komodo dragon.

1735
01:48:46,460 --> 01:48:46,860
Oh my god.

1736
01:48:52,130 --> 01:48:53,170
New customer!

1737
01:48:54,090 --> 01:48:56,070
Oh my god, did Arlo recommend you?

1738
01:48:57,710 --> 01:48:59,270
Okay, where should we spot?

1739
01:48:59,590 --> 01:48:59,890
Head?

1740
01:49:00,490 --> 01:49:01,330
Oh, it's a head, okay.

1741
01:49:02,630 --> 01:49:02,890
Alright.

1742
01:49:03,890 --> 01:49:04,530
Let's see.

1743
01:49:04,950 --> 01:49:05,890
What do I do?

1744
01:49:06,810 --> 01:49:07,930
What do I do?

1745
01:49:08,090 --> 01:49:09,490
Do I shoot you in the stomach?

1746
01:49:10,730 --> 01:49:12,190
Can I grasp you tightly?

1747
01:49:12,970 --> 01:49:13,350
No.

1748
01:49:14,030 --> 01:49:15,150
Arlo distract him!

1749
01:49:15,670 --> 01:49:16,570
He likes horses!

1750
01:49:17,990 --> 01:49:19,690
Don't worry, I'm gonna shoot him in the butt.

1751
01:49:20,710 --> 01:49:21,110
Look.

1752
01:49:22,450 --> 01:49:26,330
See, he kills, kill one of them by just doing that?

1753
01:49:26,670 --> 01:49:27,250
That would be...

1754
01:49:28,990 --> 01:49:30,850
Imagine if I just...

1755
01:49:30,850 --> 01:49:33,330
This entire stream, I just do this.

1756
01:49:34,490 --> 01:49:36,630
This is the entire stream.

1757
01:49:40,230 --> 01:49:42,170
Okay, the environment.

1758
01:49:44,490 --> 01:49:46,210
Why am I limping?

1759
01:49:47,130 --> 01:49:48,090
Why are you limping?

1760
01:49:51,710 --> 01:49:52,410
Let's see.

1761
01:49:53,150 --> 01:49:55,770
How do I use the environment against you?

1762
01:50:01,310 --> 01:50:02,970
How do I...

1763
01:50:02,970 --> 01:50:05,350
Do I go here?

1764
01:50:06,530 --> 01:50:08,790
There is a tunnel down there.

1765
01:50:10,250 --> 01:50:10,850
What is it?

1766
01:50:10,870 --> 01:50:12,510
What's the tunnels anyway?

1767
01:50:14,850 --> 01:50:16,130
Go into the cave?

1768
01:50:16,970 --> 01:50:18,990
Yeah, I was like wondering what the cave was for.

1769
01:50:20,150 --> 01:50:20,410
Alright.

1770
01:50:20,870 --> 01:50:21,730
I'll be right back.

1771
01:50:21,810 --> 01:50:23,750
I gotta get some extra materials, sir.

1772
01:50:24,610 --> 01:50:25,050
Don't worry!

1773
01:50:26,190 --> 01:50:27,170
Wait, there's another way.

1774
01:50:28,250 --> 01:50:28,790
Oh no.

1775
01:50:29,350 --> 01:50:30,650
There's two pathways.

1776
01:50:33,690 --> 01:50:36,130
Oh, because there's multiple cave entrances!

1777
01:50:39,090 --> 01:50:39,930
Wait, what?

1778
01:50:44,890 --> 01:50:46,350
Sorry, what?

1779
01:50:47,590 --> 01:50:48,550
Now I'm here.

1780
01:50:56,080 --> 01:50:58,380
Wait, wait, my head is turning?

1781
01:50:59,860 --> 01:51:00,500
I got it.

1782
01:51:00,540 --> 01:51:01,400
I figured it out.

1783
01:51:02,240 --> 01:51:03,040
I figured it out.

1784
01:51:03,940 --> 01:51:04,840
I know what to do.

1785
01:51:07,460 --> 01:51:08,740
Hello, I am here now.

1786
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:13,360
I'm gonna poke you in the ass.

1787
01:51:14,020 --> 01:51:14,400
Come on.

1788
01:51:15,260 --> 01:51:16,200
Come on.

1789
01:51:17,340 --> 01:51:19,020
Stop looking at my horse!

1790
01:51:21,240 --> 01:51:22,200
Come on!

1791
01:51:23,860 --> 01:51:25,060
I'm right here!

1792
01:51:29,880 --> 01:51:30,860
I'm right here.

1793
01:51:30,960 --> 01:51:31,920
Don't you see me?

1794
01:51:35,900 --> 01:51:37,180
I don't think he likes that.

1795
01:51:37,280 --> 01:51:37,840
He does not like that.

1796
01:51:37,960 --> 01:51:38,680
He did not like that.

1797
01:51:39,440 --> 01:51:40,220
Down here!

1798
01:51:43,640 --> 01:51:44,120
Arlo!

1799
01:51:44,940 --> 01:51:46,460
Stop baiting the horse!

1800
01:51:49,440 --> 01:51:50,400
Turn around!

1801
01:51:57,100 --> 01:51:58,060
Turn around!

1802
01:51:58,280 --> 01:51:59,300
I'm right here!

1803
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:04,700
All right.

1804
01:52:05,320 --> 01:52:09,160
We gotta make sure the fucking giant horse knows I'm here.

1805
01:52:09,980 --> 01:52:11,940
I think he fell in love with my horse.

1806
01:52:14,040 --> 01:52:15,740
I think he fell in love with my horse.

1807
01:52:17,580 --> 01:52:19,280
I'm right here, asshole.

1808
01:52:20,280 --> 01:52:21,240
That's fucking right.

1809
01:52:21,660 --> 01:52:22,360
Yeah, that's right.

1810
01:52:22,580 --> 01:52:23,020
That's right.

1811
01:52:23,100 --> 01:52:23,920
You see me?

1812
01:52:24,880 --> 01:52:25,940
That's fucking right.

1813
01:52:26,360 --> 01:52:27,600
I'm right here.

1814
01:52:28,660 --> 01:52:30,040
I don't know if that works.

All right.

1819
01:53:11,440 --> 01:53:17,160
You see the colossus that reaches back.

1820
01:53:17,340 --> 01:53:17,520
Okay.

1821
01:53:18,420 --> 01:53:18,920
Thank you, God.

1822
01:53:19,600 --> 01:53:20,640
Thank you for the backseating.

1823
01:53:21,460 --> 01:53:22,720
I really appreciate it.

1824
01:53:22,800 --> 01:53:23,540
Wait, where did he go?

1825
01:53:24,520 --> 01:53:26,440
Bro, what the fuck he just gave up?

1826
01:53:31,520 --> 01:53:32,640
He just...

1827
01:53:32,640 --> 01:53:35,620
He just gave up on me.

1828
01:53:37,540 --> 01:53:38,220
Horace!

1829
01:53:39,120 --> 01:53:41,300
I'm not just a mosquito!

1830
01:53:42,680 --> 01:53:44,700
I am your therapist!

1831
01:53:45,660 --> 01:53:47,860
And I can see you're so fucking tense.

1832
01:53:47,960 --> 01:53:48,600
Stop right now!

1833
01:53:48,620 --> 01:53:49,400
Look at you!

1834
01:53:49,880 --> 01:53:51,580
You're so tense!

1835
01:53:54,220 --> 01:53:58,360
You're so lucky your friends recommended me to take care of
you.

1836
01:54:01,520 --> 01:54:03,720
Oh my god, where's the other way to the cave?

1837
01:54:04,300 --> 01:54:05,800
Where's the other way to the cave?

1838
01:54:06,260 --> 01:54:07,760
Where's the other way to the cave?

1839
01:54:09,380 --> 01:54:10,200
Looking, he's looking.

1840
01:54:11,020 --> 01:54:12,840
He's casually looking at me now.

1841
01:54:13,740 --> 01:54:14,260
Turn around.

1842
01:54:15,320 --> 01:54:16,000
Turn around.

1843
01:54:19,420 --> 01:54:22,260
I'm trying my best guy!

1844
01:54:28,500 --> 01:54:30,960
God, I am trying my best.

1845
01:54:31,520 --> 01:54:34,020
But he's too smart to be deceived.

1846
01:54:37,200 --> 01:54:39,340
Bro, he just doesn't care!

1847
01:54:42,140 --> 01:54:45,660
He doesn't fucking care what I do!

1848
01:54:47,500 --> 01:54:51,420
Sir, you're being charged for every hour!

1849
01:54:52,560 --> 01:54:58,120
Sir, my rate has now increased to $80 an hour, sir!

1850
01:54:59,100 --> 01:55:00,300
Turn around!

1851
01:55:06,900 --> 01:55:09,640
Bro, but look at the damage though.

1852
01:55:10,280 --> 01:55:11,030
Guys, look at...

1853
01:55:12,820 --> 01:55:15,560
Look at all that damage I did.

1854
01:55:16,400 --> 01:55:18,560
That one speck of damage.

1855
01:55:19,760 --> 01:55:21,060
Stop shooting.

1856
01:55:22,540 --> 01:55:24,260
Guys, it's called acupuncture.

1857
01:55:26,720 --> 01:55:27,440
Come over here.

1858
01:55:28,060 --> 01:55:28,840
Come over here.

1859
01:55:29,460 --> 01:55:30,320
Come over here.

1860
01:55:33,180 --> 01:55:37,440
I charge... I got better experience, so I can charge $80
now.

1861
01:55:38,400 --> 01:55:40,200
I got better at my job.

1862
01:55:40,440 --> 01:55:41,100
I'm right here.

1863
01:55:41,340 --> 01:55:42,320
I'm right here, horse.

1864
01:55:43,280 --> 01:55:43,980
I'm right here.

1865
01:55:44,640 --> 01:55:45,420
Turn around.

1866
01:55:45,980 --> 01:55:46,600
Arlo, please.

1867
01:55:47,200 --> 01:55:48,000
Please, Arlo.

1868
01:55:48,700 --> 01:55:51,480
This is between me and the fucking other horse.

1869
01:55:51,720 --> 01:55:52,620
I know you're jealous.

1870
01:55:54,280 --> 01:55:56,400
But me and this horse...

1871
01:55:56,400 --> 01:55:58,040
We gotta settle something here.

1872
01:56:01,880 --> 01:56:02,440
Alright.

1873
01:56:03,820 --> 01:56:05,560
Do you see me?

1874
01:56:06,860 --> 01:56:07,380
Yeah, right?

1875
01:56:07,560 --> 01:56:08,280
You see me, right?

1876
01:56:08,440 --> 01:56:10,000
Oh, fuck, I think he knows now.

1877
01:56:10,240 --> 01:56:11,120
I think he understands.

1878
01:56:11,640 --> 01:56:12,100
Oh, God.

1879
01:56:12,540 --> 01:56:14,100
Oh, he definitely understands.

1880
01:56:14,340 --> 01:56:15,520
He definitely understands.

1881
01:56:18,920 --> 01:56:20,820
He understands now.

1882
01:56:25,120 --> 01:56:25,600
Okay.

1883
01:56:26,360 --> 01:56:26,860
Oh, my God.

1884
01:56:26,940 --> 01:56:27,680
Why am I so jink?

1885
01:56:27,920 --> 01:56:28,300
Please.

1886
01:56:28,720 --> 01:56:29,640
Please don't turn around.

1887
01:56:33,180 --> 01:56:35,740
I am trying so hard to deceive him!

1888
01:56:36,080 --> 01:56:37,800
But he doesn't care!

1889
01:56:38,400 --> 01:56:39,100
He does!

1890
01:56:43,240 --> 01:56:44,620
What do I do?

1891
01:56:44,780 --> 01:56:45,840
Okay, I got it.

1892
01:56:48,460 --> 01:56:50,020
Wait, I deceived him.

1893
01:56:51,120 --> 01:56:52,360
What do I do from here?

1894
01:56:52,980 --> 01:56:54,180
Do I just...

1895
01:56:55,340 --> 01:56:56,180
Do I just clap?

1896
01:56:58,560 --> 01:56:59,380
Oh, shit.

1897
01:56:59,720 --> 01:57:00,220
Oh, shit.

1898
01:57:00,540 --> 01:57:00,940
Oh, shit.

1899
01:57:01,200 --> 01:57:01,680
Tail!

1900
01:57:01,800 --> 01:57:02,160
Tail!

1901
01:57:02,240 --> 01:57:02,860
Grab the tail!

1902
01:57:11,560 --> 01:57:12,000
Boy!

1903
01:57:12,660 --> 01:57:14,060
He got boy!

1904
01:57:19,670 --> 01:57:21,570
He got boy!

1905
01:57:25,810 --> 01:57:26,590
It's the head.

1906
01:57:26,730 --> 01:57:27,790
Oh, it's the brains!

1907
01:57:28,130 --> 01:57:29,050
Okay, I figured it out.

1908
01:57:29,570 --> 01:57:30,550
Guys, okay, he knows.

1909
01:57:30,730 --> 01:57:31,650
Okay, I'm right here.

1910
01:57:32,430 --> 01:57:33,110
I'm right here.

1911
01:57:33,350 --> 01:57:33,850
Come over here.

1912
01:57:36,430 --> 01:57:38,010
I realized it was the brains.

1913
01:57:38,150 --> 01:57:40,150
I thought it was supposed to be the tail.

1914
01:57:42,350 --> 01:57:42,750
Alright.

1915
01:57:43,390 --> 01:57:45,310
You just don't pull somebody's hair, okay?

1916
01:57:45,450 --> 01:57:46,850
It's, like, so rude.

1917
01:57:47,710 --> 01:57:49,650
It's so rude to pull people's hairs.

1918
01:57:50,310 --> 01:57:53,230
So, like, I was just trying to be, like, polite.

1919
01:57:53,950 --> 01:57:54,350
You know?

1920
01:57:54,450 --> 01:57:57,230
It's okay to pull the tail, but not the hair.

1921
01:57:58,210 --> 01:57:59,010
Alright, this time.

1922
01:57:59,090 --> 01:57:59,890
This time, he knows.

1923
01:58:00,450 --> 01:58:01,190
He knows, right?

1924
01:58:01,510 --> 01:58:02,650
I'm right here.

1925
01:58:03,470 --> 01:58:04,410
I'm right here.

1926
01:58:05,190 --> 01:58:06,290
Okay, now he knows.

1927
01:58:08,010 --> 01:58:08,430
Alright.

1928
01:58:09,030 --> 01:58:10,310
Oh, my God, please.

1929
01:58:11,290 --> 01:58:11,730
Please.

1930
01:58:12,350 --> 01:58:25,570

01:58:47,870 --> 01:58:49,050
Grab it!

1935
01:58:49,530 --> 01:58:49,930
No!

1936
01:58:58,040 --> 01:59:02,800
That was awkward.

1937
01:59:03,560 --> 01:59:03,860
Okay.

1938
01:59:04,380 --> 01:59:07,480
I didn't know how fucking short I jumped.

1939
01:59:09,020 --> 01:59:10,260
This time!

1940
01:59:11,500 --> 01:59:12,860
He's still there!

1941
01:59:12,980 --> 01:59:13,840
He dies and notice.

1942
01:59:14,220 --> 01:59:14,760
It's okay.

1943
01:59:15,780 --> 01:59:16,820
This time.

1944
01:59:17,700 --> 01:59:18,800
He's gonna...

1945
01:59:18,800 --> 01:59:19,260
This time.

1946
01:59:19,280 --> 01:59:20,140
This time, this time.

1947
01:59:20,320 --> 01:59:21,600
There's no way he saw me this time.

1948
01:59:21,920 --> 01:59:22,560
All right, lower, lower.

1949
01:59:22,920 --> 01:59:23,980
Yes, yes, yes.

1950
01:59:24,740 --> 01:59:25,360
That's good.

1951
01:59:26,060 --> 01:59:26,740
That's good.

1952
01:59:27,280 --> 01:59:28,100
Just stay there.

1953
01:59:28,620 --> 01:59:29,380
Just stay there.

1954
01:59:31,240 --> 01:59:32,100
Yes, I did it!

1955
01:59:33,080 --> 01:59:33,740
I told you.

1956
01:59:33,760 --> 01:59:34,880
You just gotta believe.

1957
01:59:37,940 --> 01:59:39,120
You just, please.

1958
01:59:39,600 --> 01:59:40,720
You just gotta believe.

1959
01:59:42,760 --> 01:59:44,500
You just gotta- Don't worry!

1960
01:59:45,760 --> 01:59:47,440
That treatment is here!

1961
01:59:49,280 --> 01:59:49,580
Okay.

1962
01:59:50,900 --> 01:59:51,220
Don't worry.

1963
01:59:51,300 --> 01:59:52,960
I've never done it with a horse before.

1964
01:59:53,760 --> 01:59:54,940
But, like, it's the head.

1965
01:59:55,540 --> 01:59:56,620
Brains are the same.

1966
01:59:57,520 --> 01:59:59,020
The head should be the same.

1967
01:59:59,880 --> 02:00:01,960
It has a skull in there.

1968
02:00:05,340 --> 02:00:07,140
It has a skull.

1969
02:00:08,640 --> 02:00:10,600
And pointy things go in skull.

1970
02:00:12,480 --> 02:00:13,340
Here we go.

1971
02:00:15,040 --> 02:00:15,340
Alright.

1972
02:00:15,600 --> 02:00:15,960
Don't worry.

1973
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:16,380
We're fine.

1974
02:00:16,560 --> 02:00:16,880
We're fine.

1975
02:00:17,760 --> 02:00:18,180
Stab?

1976
02:00:18,640 --> 02:00:19,260
We're fine.

1977
02:00:19,780 --> 02:00:20,180
It's fine.

1978
02:00:20,180 --> 02:00:20,560
It's fine.

1979
02:00:20,700 --> 02:00:24,440
There's not a lot of blood, like human blood, but that is
okay.

1980
02:00:25,900 --> 02:00:26,700
It's okay.

1981
02:00:28,100 --> 02:00:29,340
It can't be much different.

1982
02:00:29,520 --> 02:00:30,560
It can't be much different.

1983
02:00:30,680 --> 02:00:31,540
Please stop moving.

1984
02:00:32,300 --> 02:00:34,100
Okay, maybe if I just stay here in it right now.

1985
02:00:34,240 --> 02:00:34,300
All right.

1986
02:00:34,820 --> 02:00:36,040
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1987
02:00:36,420 --> 02:00:36,780
Sir!

1988
02:00:38,060 --> 02:00:39,720
I'm not done with the treatment!

1989
02:00:43,860 --> 02:00:45,160
I should... Whoa, shit.

1990
02:00:45,320 --> 02:00:47,020
Okay, we gotta be able to grab this for now.

1991
02:00:49,280 --> 02:00:50,620
bit and recharge my stuff.

1992
02:00:50,980 --> 02:00:52,400
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1993
02:00:52,700 --> 02:00:53,980
No, no, grab on.

1994
02:00:54,580 --> 02:00:55,980
You have to keep grabbing on.

1995
02:00:56,860 --> 02:00:58,000
You have to keep grabbing on.

1996
02:00:59,200 --> 02:01:00,920
Oh, God, he's moving so much.

1997
02:01:01,440 --> 02:01:02,460
He's moving so much.

1998
02:01:02,560 --> 02:01:03,080
It's so hard.

1999
02:01:05,960 --> 02:01:06,580
That's okay.

2000
02:01:06,760 --> 02:01:07,100
It's fine.

2001
02:01:07,520 --> 02:01:08,300
No, no, no, no, no.

2002
02:01:09,600 --> 02:01:11,140
Oh, God, this is so difficult.

2003
02:01:13,160 --> 02:01:14,720
Okay, I'm just gonna recharge it here.

2004
02:01:15,300 --> 02:01:15,780
He's chilled.

2005
02:01:16,160 --> 02:01:17,620
I'm like a little, like, headfly.

2006
02:01:19,280 --> 02:01:29,580
like those like little birds that just stand on the head of
like some fucking lion they're just like whatever it's okay

2007
02:01:29,580 --> 02:01:39,240
you don't need to see the stamina everything is okay as long
as long as it's working hold your horses

2008
02:01:42,900 --> 02:01:46,320
so we're just recharging a little by little and then step

2009
02:01:50,220 --> 02:01:52,040
God, you're so fucking stressed.

2010
02:01:52,640 --> 02:01:53,240
Isn't Martha?

2011
02:01:53,520 --> 02:01:54,580
Are you in the kids alright?

2012
02:01:55,060 --> 02:01:56,100
Did she take the kids?

2013
02:01:58,060 --> 02:02:00,060
Sir, I don't think therapy can...

2014
02:02:00,060 --> 02:02:00,880
I don't think...

2015
02:02:00,880 --> 02:02:01,960
I don't think massage.

2016
02:02:02,300 --> 02:02:04,360
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

2017
02:02:04,960 --> 02:02:05,340
Okay.

2018
02:02:06,180 --> 02:02:07,060
Oh, hey, there's this.

2019
02:02:07,220 --> 02:02:08,420
You might as well stab this dude.

2020
02:02:10,840 --> 02:02:12,200
I mean, it's here.

2021
02:02:12,840 --> 02:02:13,540
Oh, I might as well.

2022
02:02:16,100 --> 02:02:18,060
It's just like a little bonus area, too.

2023
02:02:19,280 --> 02:02:19,500
Nice.

2024
02:02:19,660 --> 02:02:20,500
He's less stressed.

2025
02:02:23,540 --> 02:02:24,140
Oh, wait.

2026
02:02:24,240 --> 02:02:24,640
What the fuck?

2027
02:02:24,720 --> 02:02:25,660
How did you wake up?

2028
02:02:26,640 --> 02:02:27,320
Oh, no.

2029
02:02:29,540 --> 02:02:32,520
Look, I think you need more than just massages, man.

2030
02:02:33,020 --> 02:02:39,700
I know, like, you have some extra spending money now that
you don't have to have to worry about, like, Martha and the

2031
02:02:39,700 --> 02:02:40,100
kids.

2032
02:02:40,800 --> 02:02:43,380
But, bro, you gotta, get...

2033
02:02:43,380 --> 02:02:45,700
You gotta, like, actually go to therapy, man.

2034
02:02:46,480 --> 02:02:47,720
Massages aren't therapy.

2035
02:02:50,960 --> 02:02:52,000
Oh, shit.

2036
02:02:54,420 --> 02:02:55,720
He's a stress.

2037
02:02:57,200 --> 02:02:58,920
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2038
02:02:59,060 --> 02:03:00,320
I can relax a little bit.

2039
02:03:00,840 --> 02:03:02,580
I can relax a little bit here.

2040
02:03:03,540 --> 02:03:03,760
All right.

2041
02:03:04,500 --> 02:03:07,120
But holy shit, look at all these pent-up blood.

2042
02:03:09,360 --> 02:03:10,100
Don't worry.

2043
02:03:10,600 --> 02:03:13,980
The best I can do is make you forget just a little bit.

2044
02:03:14,620 --> 02:03:14,980
All right.

2045
02:03:16,020 --> 02:03:17,720
You're just a few more stabs.

2046
02:03:20,140 --> 02:03:21,520
What do you mean?

2047
02:03:21,880 --> 02:03:25,260
His child support payments are colossal.

2048
02:03:34,640 --> 02:03:36,720
Now he's relaxed forever.

2049
02:03:38,040 --> 02:03:40,180
I'm not licensed or anything.

2050
02:03:40,880 --> 02:03:42,260
But I don't need to be licensed.

2051
02:03:42,380 --> 02:03:43,480
I'm just that talented.

2052
02:03:44,340 --> 02:03:44,660
Yay.

2053
02:03:45,320 --> 02:03:49,640
So look, now he doesn't have to worry about the kids for
today.

2054
02:03:54,850 --> 02:03:55,570
Yay!

2055
02:03:57,490 --> 02:03:58,590
I leveled up!

2056
02:03:59,910 --> 02:04:02,250
Now I charge $100 an hour.

2057
02:04:04,050 --> 02:04:05,810
Another 10 out of 10 review.

2058
02:04:06,550 --> 02:04:07,770
Dracula, welcome to the tomato farm.

2059

Welcome, welcome.

2060

02:04:13,890 --> 02:04:14,770
Oh my god!

2062
02:04:15,090 --> 02:04:16,410
So many Google reviews.

2063
02:04:20,380 --> 02:04:22,520
If you're good at your job, you don't need a license.

2064
02:04:23,640 --> 02:04:25,020
I fixed depression.

2065
02:04:26,160 --> 02:04:26,640
I fixed depression.

2066
02:04:29,240 --> 02:04:32,560
10 out of 10 my wife left me

2067
02:04:37,580 --> 02:04:45,660

meatballs after that hmm

02:05:07,840 --> 02:05:10,860
Pass the colossus shadow across a misty lake.

2071
02:05:11,080 --> 02:05:12,640
Oh, is this a fish, colossus?

2072
02:05:14,900 --> 02:05:16,280
Is this a...

2073
02:05:16,280 --> 02:05:18,420
I fucking was playing for two hours?

2074
02:05:19,620 --> 02:05:23,040
Okay, this game fucking makes time pass by so fast.

2075
02:05:23,180 --> 02:05:24,780
This does not feel to, like, two hours.

2076
02:05:25,340 --> 02:05:27,820
I did not feel like I was playing for two hours.

2077
02:05:32,440 --> 02:05:33,540
Holy shit.

2078
02:05:35,440 --> 02:05:35,960
Damn.

2079
02:05:36,900 --> 02:05:38,080
That means I've only...

2080
02:05:38,600 --> 02:05:38,880
Oop!

2081
02:05:39,760 --> 02:05:40,480
Okay, gotta pray.

2082
02:05:40,740 --> 02:05:41,380
Pray to save.

2083
02:05:44,160 --> 02:05:44,680
Pray.

2084
02:05:48,840 --> 02:05:49,080
Alright.

2085
02:05:51,280 --> 02:05:52,340
Where do we go?

2086
02:05:52,720 --> 02:05:53,180
Sword!

02:05:59,420 --> 02:06:00,860
Where is it telling me?

2090
02:06:00,960 --> 02:06:01,220
What?

2091
02:06:02,300 --> 02:06:02,920
This way?

2092
02:06:05,280 --> 02:06:06,620
I have to go to the lake.

2093
02:06:06,920 --> 02:06:07,380
Here.

2094
02:06:07,800 --> 02:06:07,980
Okay.

2095
02:06:08,920 --> 02:06:09,520
Alright, Arlo.

Arlo, come over here.

2097
02:06:13,220 --> 02:06:15,000
I need to go to a lake now.

2098
02:06:16,380 --> 02:06:17,300
I'm gonna do good progress.

2099
02:06:17,440 --> 02:06:19,320
I got, like, poor clients so far.

2100
02:06:22,220 --> 02:06:25,640
Will you guys let me drill a hole into your head to let out
your stress?

2101
02:06:30,660 --> 02:06:32,980
For, like, $100 an hour?

2102
02:06:35,920 --> 02:06:36,320
Sure.

2103
02:06:37,960 --> 02:06:39,060
Why not?

2104
02:06:39,100 --> 02:06:41,040
It is like a fucking deal.

2105
02:06:41,500 --> 02:06:42,480
A good bargain.

2106
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:43,320
Chat.

2107
02:06:44,040 --> 02:06:48,440
It is actually like 100% an absolute steal.

2108
02:06:51,580 --> 02:06:53,320
Guys, but what about the stress blood?

2109
02:06:53,520 --> 02:06:54,480
The stress oil.

2110
02:06:55,620 --> 02:06:57,320
Think about the stress oil.

2111
02:06:59,460 --> 02:06:59,920
Chat.

2112
02:07:01,140 --> 02:07:02,620

It's not eternal sleep, it's just sleep-sleep.

2134
02:08:58,990 --> 02:08:59,730
That's different.

2135
02:09:01,290 --> 02:09:02,190
Is it this way?

2136
02:09:02,730 --> 02:09:03,390
I can't tell.

2137
02:09:04,130 --> 02:09:05,090
The sword was gone.

2138
02:09:09,460 --> 02:09:11,160
I hope I'm going the right way.

2139
02:09:16,500 --> 02:09:17,860
Where am I?

2140
02:09:18,680 --> 02:09:26,220
I hope I hope I'm going the right way.

2141
02:09:27,300 --> 02:09:28,100
One fear.

2142
02:09:30,340 --> 02:09:30,920
The fuck?

2143
02:09:31,140 --> 02:09:32,320
How do I...

2144
02:09:32,320 --> 02:09:33,000
I'm trapped.

2145
02:09:37,790 --> 02:09:38,950
I'm so trapped.

2146
02:09:40,510 --> 02:09:41,010
Where do I go?

2147
02:09:41,550 --> 02:09:41,910
Oh!

2148
02:09:42,190 --> 02:09:42,630
A clam.

2149
02:09:43,790 --> 02:09:44,050
Okay.

2150
02:09:44,890 --> 02:09:45,370
Climb time.

2151
02:09:45,870 --> 02:09:46,250
Climb.

2152
02:09:47,050 --> 02:09:47,410
Climb.

2153
02:09:47,570 --> 02:09:48,490
time.

2154
02:09:48,530 --> 02:09:48,530
Um.

2155
02:09:53,170 --> 02:09:53,430
Alright.

2156
02:09:53,670 --> 02:09:55,190
Let's see if the Colossus is here.

2157
02:09:56,210 --> 02:09:57,010
Is it here?

2158
02:09:57,990 --> 02:10:00,050
God hasn't told me anything yet.

2159
02:10:02,830 --> 02:10:03,310
God?

2160
02:10:03,610 --> 02:10:04,130
Am I...

2161
02:10:04,130 --> 02:10:05,350
Am I at the right area?

2162
02:10:05,930 --> 02:10:06,550
I am!

2163
02:10:07,090 --> 02:10:08,170
Thank you, God.

2164
02:10:12,970 --> 02:10:14,090
I knew it.

2165
02:10:14,130 --> 02:10:17,050
Thank you, God, for telling me where to go.

2166
02:10:18,170 --> 02:10:19,770
Oh, it's a bird!

2167
02:10:20,830 --> 02:10:22,870
It's a bird colossus.

2168
02:10:26,980 --> 02:10:29,280
God, it's tired of me.

2169
02:10:30,260 --> 02:10:31,040
Hello, God.

2170
02:10:33,380 --> 02:10:34,320
Oh, he's so cool.

2171
02:10:34,780 --> 02:10:35,720
I love the design.

2172
02:10:38,120 --> 02:10:39,640
The design's really pretty.

2173
02:10:41,500 --> 02:10:42,640
Wait, this one's difficult?

2174
02:10:43,280 --> 02:10:43,580
No.

2175
02:10:44,760 --> 02:10:45,560
What do I do?

2176
02:10:46,320 --> 02:10:46,840
Can I die?

2177
02:10:47,800 --> 02:10:48,680
No, I'm okay.

2178
02:10:49,900 --> 02:10:53,720
All right, I think I have to, like, go somewhere, right?

2179
02:10:55,620 --> 02:10:56,420
Don't worry.

2180
02:10:57,100 --> 02:10:58,640
I do not swim very fast.

2181
02:10:58,980 --> 02:10:59,680
Give me a sec.

2182
02:11:03,200 --> 02:11:04,720
I am trying my best.

2183
02:11:06,120 --> 02:11:08,720
Yeah, it reminds me of the Crow Pokemon.

2184
02:11:09,800 --> 02:11:12,560
And, uh, yeah, it reminds me of the Crow Pokemon.

2185
02:11:14,920 --> 02:11:15,500
All right.

2186
02:11:16,800 --> 02:11:18,020
Don't worry, Crow.

2187
02:11:21,060 --> 02:11:29,320
Don't worry, I haven't massaged your crow before, but I
think it's the same anatomy as a person.

2188
02:11:30,600 --> 02:11:32,640
It can't be that different.

2189
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:34,080
A head is a head.

2190
02:11:36,460 --> 02:11:37,380
There's a brain.

2191
02:11:39,500 --> 02:11:40,540
Did you see me?

2192
02:11:40,960 --> 02:11:41,680
Did you see me?

2193
02:11:41,880 --> 02:11:42,480
I'm friendly!

2194
02:11:43,500 --> 02:11:44,600
The horse sent me!

2195
02:11:45,280 --> 02:11:46,480
Diesel's still alive!

2196
02:11:50,640 --> 02:11:52,060
The horse sent me.

2197
02:11:52,080 --> 02:11:53,180
He's still alive.

2198
02:11:53,280 --> 02:11:54,060
I'm friendly.

2199
02:11:55,580 --> 02:11:56,640
Where you're weak point?

2200
02:11:57,720 --> 02:11:57,720
Head?

2201
02:11:58,400 --> 02:11:59,440
I assume it's the head.

2202
02:12:00,700 --> 02:12:01,580
Okay, let's see.

2203
02:12:03,760 --> 02:12:05,920
Ooh, the music is really nice, though.

2204
02:12:12,870 --> 02:12:13,930
Alright, let's see.

2205
02:12:14,110 --> 02:12:16,690
I'm gonna have to swim to over there.

2206
02:12:16,710 --> 02:12:18,830
I don't know if I'm gonna swim to him or something.

2207
02:12:22,710 --> 02:12:24,210
It's like there's so many.

2208
02:12:24,430 --> 02:12:26,550
There's so many pillars.

2209
02:12:27,230 --> 02:12:28,210
Do I swim to him?

2210
02:12:29,950 --> 02:12:32,030
All right, I'm gonna say hi.

2211
02:12:32,890 --> 02:12:34,870
Don't do anything dumb.

2212
02:12:41,360 --> 02:12:42,600
Hello, bird.

2213
02:12:43,640 --> 02:12:44,600
I'm friendly.

2214
02:12:45,640 --> 02:12:46,560
I'm so friendly.

2215
02:12:46,860 --> 02:12:48,660
All your friends like me.

2216
02:12:53,360 --> 02:12:55,900
I'm just here to give you a nice massage.

2217
02:12:56,940 --> 02:12:58,360
And some acupuncture.

2218
02:12:58,900 --> 02:13:02,100
And like letting some extra stress oil out of your head.

2219
02:13:03,060 --> 02:13:06,120
Oh, okay.

2220
02:13:07,160 --> 02:13:07,940
Don't worry.

2221
02:13:09,700 --> 02:13:10,700
I'm in the water.

2222
02:13:10,940 --> 02:13:11,580
I can't.

2223
02:13:13,700 --> 02:13:15,240
Give me a secro.

2224
02:13:16,480 --> 02:13:19,120
I need to go back onto the wall.

2225
02:13:20,780 --> 02:13:21,620
Oh my god.

2226
02:13:21,720 --> 02:13:23,540
I feel like I'm fucking drowning.

2227
02:13:23,900 --> 02:13:24,300
Why?

2228
02:13:26,720 --> 02:13:28,880
Like the way he fucking swims.

2229
02:13:28,900 --> 02:13:31,660
It looks like I'm actually drowning.

2230
02:13:33,900 --> 02:13:35,300
Thank you, God.

2231
02:13:36,320 --> 02:13:39,340
I can always count on you to backseat me, God.

2232
02:13:43,440 --> 02:13:43,740
Crew!

2233
02:13:46,100 --> 02:13:46,740
Whoop!

2234
02:13:47,840 --> 02:13:49,380
You see me?

2235
02:13:50,780 --> 02:13:51,760
Yeah, that's me!

2236
02:13:52,660 --> 02:13:53,900
Are we gonna be okay?

2237
02:13:54,740 --> 02:13:55,160

Oh, God.

02:14:10,220 --> 02:14:10,880
What the fuck?

2246
02:14:11,020 --> 02:14:12,260

2247
02:14:14,940 --> 02:14:15,720

The most frustrating boss!

2394
02:23:39,850 --> 02:23:41,930
He's actually so frustrating.

2395
02:23:42,690 --> 02:23:43,950

We're going to the back of the wing.

2405
02:24:11,390 --> 02:24:13,570
We're going to the back of the wing now.

2406
02:24:14,190 --> 02:24:16,270
I'd rather deal with the wing stress here.

2407
02:24:18,430 --> 02:24:19,310
Oh god.

2408
02:24:19,590 --> 02:24:19,890

02:25:09,550 --> 02:25:11,770

Wait, if I dive down, they can't catch me.

2438
02:26:25,460 --> 02:26:28,320
The shadows can't catch me if I swim under.

2439
02:26:29,740 --> 02:26:31,020
Wait, where is the shadow?

2440
02:26:32,380 --> 02:26:33,440
Oh, never mind.

2441
02:26:34,340 --> 02:26:35,680

Well, it is not.

2448
02:27:56,080 --> 02:27:57,740
What kind of Colossus is that?

2449
02:28:01,570 --> 02:28:03,690
I think we're making really good progress.

2450
02:28:03,850 --> 02:28:05,470
I'm going to look at my dead girlfriend now.

2451
02:28:07,350 --> 02:28:08,430
A little dead girlfriend.

2452
02:28:09,570 --> 02:28:10,310
Don't worry.

2453
02:28:11,030 --> 02:28:13,110

2455
02:28:14,610 --> 02:28:17,330
If you break up with me after I did all of this.

2456
02:28:20,810 --> 02:28:22,010
I swear to God.

2457
02:28:25,910 --> 02:28:26,510
Okay.

2458
02:28:27,270 --> 02:28:29,470
Time to go find...

2459
02:28:29,470 --> 02:28:33,830
Time to go find the other Colossus.

2460
02:28:38,580 --> 02:28:40,140
That would be very tragic.

2461
02:28:40,380 --> 02:28:41,900
I'd feel so sorry for this kid.

2462
02:28:43,280 --> 02:28:44,120
What?

2463
02:28:44,320 --> 02:28:46,940
I wore a boyfriend toki.

2464
02:28:49,980 --> 02:28:52,480
That got so dark.

2465
02:28:56,380 --> 02:28:58,140
Alright, time to pray.

2466
02:29:00,140 --> 02:29:00,580
Pray.

2467
02:29:01,080 --> 02:29:01,860
Pray to save.

2468
02:29:03,840 --> 02:29:05,460
Alright, where do we go?

2469
02:29:05,720 --> 02:29:06,560
Arlo, where do we go?

2470
02:29:07,460 --> 02:29:07,740
Arlo!

2471
02:29:09,540 --> 02:29:11,220
We go...

2472
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:14,220
This way.

2473
02:29:14,480 --> 02:29:14,720
Alright.

2474
02:29:16,900 --> 02:29:18,020
Alright, Arlo.

2475
02:29:19,160 --> 02:29:19,700
You know what?

2476
02:29:21,600 --> 02:29:23,320
Let us do...

2477
02:29:23,320 --> 02:29:25,220
I know this is a short stream today.

2478
02:29:25,600 --> 02:29:28,660
But I think that is a good place to stop it.

2479
02:29:29,980 --> 02:29:31,340
I think six...

2480
02:29:31,340 --> 02:29:32,600
What, five bosses?

2481
02:29:33,240 --> 02:29:36,300

Hi, Duggy, congrats on the Razor sponsorship.

2539
02:33:15,320 --> 02:33:17,160
Oh, it's not really a sponsorship.

2540
02:33:17,420 --> 02:33:19,740
It's more so they sent me some gifts.

2541
02:33:20,140 --> 02:33:22,020
So it's not like, it's not a sponsor.

2542
02:33:22,160 --> 02:33:26,680
It's like, they just sent me some gifts and like some free
products to try out.

2543
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:28,980
So I'm not like sponsored by them.

2544
02:33:29,240 --> 02:33:33,400
If I am, I'll let you guys know because it's legal to like
not put the hashtag.

2545
02:33:37,260 --> 02:33:41,320
It's illegal to not put like an hashtag if it was sponsored.

2546
02:33:41,340 --> 02:33:49,440
So, so it's more so like they just sent me some gifts to,
to, uh, to try out.

2547
02:33:49,440 --> 02:33:50,440
Yeah, free is free.

2548
02:33:50,620 --> 02:33:51,640
I love free stuff.

2549
02:33:52,480 --> 02:33:57,680
Um, but there is a sponsor this week that I'm really, really
excited about.

2550
02:33:58,220 --> 02:34:00,740
Um, it's sort of like a dream sponsor.

2551
02:34:01,100 --> 02:34:04,480
So, uh, yeah, I don't know when exactly.

2552
02:34:04,820 --> 02:34:06,820

content creators i watched growing up they're all like like

2582
02:36:36,380 --> 02:36:48,220

craziest part is that you see them all the okay i think this

2583
02:36:48,220 --> 02:36:55,920
okay i'm not gonna name any creators but i think the
funniest ones are the ones that are like in their 30s to 40s

and like um oh my gosh no i shouldn't say it never mind it's

2586
02:37:12,660 --> 02:37:15,420
I was gonna say, the ones that are doing...

2587
02:37:15,420 --> 02:37:16,860
Oh my god.

2588
02:37:17,080 --> 02:37:19,380
The ones that are doing Roblox stuff.

2589
02:37:19,800 --> 02:37:20,460
And they're like...

2590
02:37:20,460 --> 02:37:24,500
Because like, you know, they started out Roblox content in
their maybe in their 30s.

2591
02:37:24,580 --> 02:37:26,640
Or maybe in their 20s.

2592
02:37:26,720 --> 02:37:28,880
And they're still doing Roblox content.

2593
02:37:29,020 --> 02:37:30,700
And they're like in their 40s.

2594
02:37:31,020 --> 02:37:31,700
I don't know.

2595
02:37:32,100 --> 02:37:33,660
I don't...

2596
02:37:34,880 --> 02:37:36,440
Look, money is money.

2597
02:37:36,640 --> 02:37:37,440
I understand.

2598
02:37:39,200 --> 02:37:40,380
Money is money.

2599
02:37:40,580 --> 02:37:40,680
Okay.

2600
02:37:40,700 --> 02:37:47,300
I'm not going to touch minecraft my like the minecraft part
this is why I don't I'm not into like like I'm into like I

2601
02:37:47,300 --> 02:37:56,560
like just casually playing minecraft but the minecraft
community is like a whole nother section of do not touch

2602
02:37:56,560 --> 02:38:09,580
like the Minecraft community section is just I'm not it's
Like, there are certain places you don't touch and, like,

2603
02:38:09,580 --> 02:38:11,080
you don't try to get into.

2604
02:38:11,440 --> 02:38:13,860
Like, the Minecraft community is one of them.

2605
02:38:13,940 --> 02:38:19,980
Like, I try to avoid what the fuck is going on in that area
of community.

2606
02:38:21,320 --> 02:38:26,820
It's more so of, like, the younger the audience, because
that's like, okay, this is how...

2607
02:38:26,820 --> 02:38:29,760
This is my... This is my opinion.

2608
02:38:30,860 --> 02:38:43,880
But I think, like, the younger your audience base is, harder
it is to control the community and like and the harder it is

2609
02:38:43,880 --> 02:38:56,840
to like um how do i say things will get like shit lots of
drama i think the younger the community the more like the

2610
02:38:56,840 --> 02:39:08,300
more controversies and drama comes to be so that is why if
you are under 13 and you're my stream you are not supposed

2611
02:39:08,300 --> 02:39:16,780
to have a YouTube account unless you have a YouTube kids
account but even then if you have a YouTube kids account you

2612
02:39:16,780 --> 02:39:27,940
should not be able to watch this stream and don't say I'm 13
because you can actually get bad I'll say that now like

2613
02:39:27,940 --> 02:39:39,020
you're gonna be like I'm 13 or like I'm 12 you can actually
get banned by youtube if you're if you say that so don't

2614
02:39:39,020 --> 02:39:52,300
tell us your age do not tell us don't dox your age do not
dox your age but like i just feel like personally this is my

2615
02:39:52,300 --> 02:40:03,780
opinion but definitely like if the community of like a
fandom or like a particular just a particular if majority of

2616
02:40:03,780 --> 02:40:12,000
their audience of like whatever like you know me like
majority audience are like kids like that's a lot of issues

2617
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:19,940
like there's a lot of problems and ish because you can't
control children children we're i was a stupid child i was a

2618
02:40:19,940 --> 02:40:27,140
fucking stupid child that like thought i was the smartest
person in the whole wild world i'd be like i'm smarter than

2619
02:40:27,140 --> 02:40:35,780
like you i'll be like you're like 25 but i'm smarter than
you because my opinions matter more and then but like our

2620
02:40:35,780 --> 02:40:41,400
brains are still fucking growing and back now i think my
brain stopped growing uh

2621
02:40:46,180 --> 02:40:59,080
and um and like i and like i and like i don't want to argue
with a child like i don't i don't want to to see who's right

2622
02:40:59,080 --> 02:41:07,000
or wrong like i don't have time for that i have to worry
about like fucking bills and taxes i don't have time to

2623
02:41:07,000 --> 02:41:16,840
argue about with you about what your opinion is i just bro
i'm stressed about real life issues

2624
02:41:21,680 --> 02:41:30,760
um and that's what i was like i i like i try to stay away in
terms of like communities that are more like children

2625
02:41:30,760 --> 02:41:40,000
centric because like i feel like i just feel like from
experience not just like not just from uh current but even

2626
02:41:40,000 --> 02:41:47,380
like in the past on the internet history the younger your
audiences or like the main audience like i like if you're

2627
02:41:47,380 --> 02:41:53,080
you if you're young and you're watching me i'm fine i'm cool
with you don't worry but i'm talking about like you know if

2628
02:41:53,080 --> 02:42:03,580
the main audience base is just kid is mature like 80%
children it's so hard to control that type of community

2629
02:42:03,580 --> 02:42:16,680
because especially especially if they're teenagers and we
all know when you're a teenager you love to rebel you love

2630
02:42:16,680 --> 02:42:30,380
to rebel um it's playing with fire but yeah that's why i try
i i'm scared i thank you for the super chat thank you thank

2631
02:42:30,380 --> 02:42:40,900

like how you guys are like arlo is arlo is a she but guys

2633
02:42:52,480 --> 02:42:55,320
How would I know the gender of this horse?

2634
02:42:55,940 --> 02:42:58,080
They never mention it.

2635
02:43:00,440 --> 02:43:04,340
I don't have a game guide to look at.

2636
02:43:05,160 --> 02:43:05,320
Okay.

2637
02:43:06,000 --> 02:43:08,180
I know this is what I actually miss.

2638
02:43:09,040 --> 02:43:09,800
This is...

2639
02:43:09,800 --> 02:43:10,680
You can tell...

2640
02:43:10,680 --> 02:43:17,560
You can see.

2641
02:43:17,900 --> 02:43:19,280
What if they just remove it?

2642
02:43:19,300 --> 02:43:21,000
Because they want the game to be PG.

2643
02:43:23,740 --> 02:43:26,360
Not every game has genitals!

2644
02:43:27,100 --> 02:43:28,360
Except for general justing.

2645
02:43:28,640 --> 02:43:30,740
But not every game has genitals!

2646
02:43:31,420 --> 02:43:33,140
You don't know that!

2647
02:43:37,700 --> 02:43:38,120
Okay.

2648
02:43:38,780 --> 02:43:39,200
Anyway.

2649
02:43:40,320 --> 02:43:40,900
Okay.

2650
02:43:41,340 --> 02:43:42,560
Was the last guardian?

2651
02:43:42,880 --> 02:43:43,120
Alright.

2652
02:43:43,260 --> 02:43:44,500
The last guardian.

2653
02:43:45,000 --> 02:43:45,720
That game.

2654
02:43:46,520 --> 02:43:49,320
Was that bird thing a guy or a girl?

2655
02:43:50,560 --> 02:43:52,360
Was the bird thing a guy or a girl?

2656
02:43:52,480 --> 02:43:55,860
tell me guys i need to know

2657
02:43:58,920 --> 02:44:12,820
yes yeah where the fuck was the genitals there was no giant
pp bird pp oh wait birds don't have pp's sorry i forgot but

2658
02:44:12,820 --> 02:44:18,760
it was like a griffin so like it was half bird maybe the
down half was not a bird

2659
02:44:23,120 --> 02:44:25,200
I forgot about that.

2660
02:44:25,560 --> 02:44:26,420
First, don't have pee-pee.

2661
02:44:26,500 --> 02:44:27,900
All of it comes from one hole.

2662
02:44:29,500 --> 02:44:32,600
The bottom half didn't have to be a bird.

2663
02:44:33,540 --> 02:44:34,240
It could be...

2664
02:44:34,240 --> 02:44:35,140
It could be a mammal.

2665
02:44:35,280 --> 02:44:36,640
The bottom half could be a mammal.

2666
02:44:36,960 --> 02:44:37,960
Yes, the lion half.

2667
02:44:38,100 --> 02:44:38,920
Yes, exactly.

2668
02:44:39,260 --> 02:44:40,760
The lion half.

2669
02:44:41,780 --> 02:44:43,880
Guys, where the fuck was that pee-pee?

2670
02:44:44,420 --> 02:44:44,880
No.

2671
02:44:45,180 --> 02:44:47,600
So, games doesn't necessarily mean...

2672
02:44:47,600 --> 02:44:49,340
It doesn't mean that...

2673
02:44:49,340 --> 02:44:50,900
It'll show the genitals.

2674
02:44:51,320 --> 02:44:52,460
It doesn't mean...

2675
02:44:52,480 --> 02:45:03,440
that anyway what i really miss too is the game guides oh my
gosh i miss i miss it when like uh when you buy a game like

2676
02:45:03,440 --> 02:45:10,540
a physical copy and then it includes like an actual like
game guide of like all the cool stuff about the lore and

2677
02:45:10,540 --> 02:45:18,440
everything but they don't do that anymore because like you
know you don't have to pay more money and and everyone buys

2678
02:45:18,440 --> 02:45:27,540
digitally now everyone does like save money we don't have to
fucking hire a translator to translate the fucking

2679
02:45:27,540 --> 02:45:33,860
instruction manual and also we don't have to like hire
somebody to write this up and also saves like the paper tool

2680
02:45:33,860 --> 02:45:40,980
the paper money uh rock thank you for the super chat thing

let's see night thank you for the you.

2683
02:45:53,280 --> 02:45:59,520
The good old days when the game manual sometimes didn't even
include the controls and was just a short story intro.

2684
02:45:59,760 --> 02:46:00,500
Thank you for the super chat.

2685
02:46:00,700 --> 02:46:00,820

Thank you.

2691
02:46:04,160 --> 02:46:04,720
Thank you.

2692
02:46:05,260 --> 02:46:10,980
Puzzle games with Doki is just chat plays with funny anime
girl on the bottom right talking about the weirdest things

2693
02:46:10,980 --> 02:46:11,400
in the world.

2694
02:46:11,600 --> 02:46:15,720
Weird Doki's brain cells piloting the tomato piloting the
skin.

2695
02:46:16,140 --> 02:46:17,740
Thank you for the super chat.

2696
02:46:17,860 --> 02:46:18,240
Thank you.

2697
02:46:18,700 --> 02:46:19,240
Thank you.

2698
02:46:22,480 --> 02:46:27,960
I am pretty sure the more I am as a streamer, the more
stupid I've become.

2699
02:46:28,260 --> 02:46:29,760
I'm pretty sure.

2700
02:46:31,500 --> 02:46:32,600
There's no way.

2701
02:46:32,820 --> 02:46:36,800
I'm pretty sure I've actually lost brain cells from
streaming.

2702
02:46:42,380 --> 02:46:42,780
Medi.

2703
02:46:43,160 --> 02:46:45,820
I never read those King guys and just winged it, but it was
nice to have.

2704
02:46:45,860 --> 02:46:46,500
Think of a super chat.

2705
02:46:46,580 --> 02:46:46,940
Think of a thing.

2706
02:46:47,000 --> 02:46:49,500
I just like it when they include concept art, too.

2707
02:46:49,840 --> 02:46:51,200
That's what I loved about it.

2708
02:46:51,200 --> 02:46:55,600
I remember, like, as a kid, like, just looking at the
concept part and everything.

2709
02:46:56,380 --> 02:46:58,400
Oh, and then the strategy guides, too.

2710
02:46:58,560 --> 02:47:01,680
They don't make strategy guides anymore, because you can
just fucking YouTube.

2711
02:47:02,200 --> 02:47:03,340
No commentary playthrough.

2712
02:47:05,140 --> 02:47:08,380
Bro, I used to own, like, so many strategy guides.

2713
02:47:08,560 --> 02:47:09,860
I owned, like, all the Pokemon.

2714
02:47:10,280 --> 02:47:16,380
Majority of the Pokemon strategy guides that came out, and,
like, had the Kingdom Hearts one, too.

2715
02:47:16,500 --> 02:47:18,420
Like, yeah, the ones that come with free posters.

2716
02:47:19,080 --> 02:47:20,120
We don't do that.

2717
02:47:20,120 --> 02:47:30,400
we just like we just fucking watched the no commentary they
still make them who buys them what the fuck how do they make

2718
02:47:30,400 --> 02:47:35,640
enough money to still make them i'm so confused how

2719
02:47:38,680 --> 02:47:47,560
um i'm surprised they can they still make enough money to to
manufacture the strategy guys uh next thing they give us uh

2720
02:47:47,560 --> 02:47:54,420
akasupa thank you thank you i can feel the stress leaving my
body already thank you for the oxy another happy customer

2721
02:47:54,420 --> 02:48:02,300
another happy customer thank you the akasupa thank you thank
you um do people even buy like collect i know like games

2722
02:48:02,300 --> 02:48:11,360
nowadays they do like collector's editions and stuff like
that but like i'm wondering if people still gosh i swear a

2723
02:48:11,360 --> 02:48:18,600
lot of the collector's editions are so mediocre too i feel
like there's not hasn't been like really good collector's

2724
02:48:18,600 --> 02:48:25,320
editions lately uh because a lot of them are just incredibly
mediocre when oh my god i'm trying to remember there was

2725
02:48:25,320 --> 02:48:33,040
like a really bad one recently it was like they kind of suck
now i feel like they kind of just like capitalize on like

2726
02:48:33,040 --> 02:48:39,200
people just wanting to buy collectors editions because they
are they they they are like the fear of missing out and

2727
02:48:39,200 --> 02:48:44,840
things like that because they're like oh i don't want to
miss out like it's limited edition and there was a really

2728
02:48:44,840 --> 02:48:47,320
shitty one was it the Fallout 76 one.

2729
02:48:48,320 --> 02:48:49,600
The Fallout, oh yeah.

2730
02:48:49,840 --> 02:48:52,720
The Fallout 76 one was pretty fucking bad.

2731
02:48:53,100 --> 02:48:56,040
And like, sometimes the figures are so ugly too.

2732
02:48:56,200 --> 02:48:59,220
It's like the quality control is just not even worth it.

2733
02:48:59,460 --> 02:49:01,920
They make sure like the...

2734
02:49:02,540 --> 02:49:07,920
Um, they make sure like the, the, the pictures for it is
like really, really pretty.

2735
02:49:08,380 --> 02:49:11,340
And then, cause they, they grab the sample copy for the
figure.

2736
02:49:11,460 --> 02:49:18,440
And then when you get it, it's just, it's just a very
cheaper version of the, the mass-produced version of the

2737
02:49:18,440 --> 02:49:28,500
figure and it's like not the best Lolly thank you the super
chat thank you thank you um yeah it's just to trap you in to

2738
02:49:28,500 --> 02:49:34,900
buy the collector's edition I also think but like the thing
that sucks that we're all going to digital now for like um I

2739
02:49:34,900 --> 02:49:41,480
think the thing that sucks the most regarding like us
transitioning to like digital copies of things it's just the

2740
02:49:41,480 --> 02:49:48,840
fact that when they take down the game um itself like
there's no way to play the game anymore like legally and I

2741
02:49:48,840 --> 02:49:55,520
think that's the worst part because everything there's no
more physical copies so like I mean they've been doing that

2742
02:49:55,520 --> 02:50:03,500
for movies and TV shows now and like um I'm I'm the thing
that people oh did you guys see a lot of people are really

2743
02:50:03,500 --> 02:50:11,780
worried that when Gabe you know because he's getting older I
know like someone's no Gabe is gonna live forever he's a god

2744
02:50:11,780 --> 02:50:20,560
he's gonna live forever but did you guys hear how like
people like worried that when Gabe like retires or like um

2745
02:50:20,560 --> 02:50:28,140
or like is not here anymore that the steam is gonna like
start being like heavily regulated and stuff by whoever

2746
02:50:28,140 --> 02:50:37,300
purchased it like whoever whoever owns steam after Gabe
leaves because he's the CEO he's the CEO and like a lot of

2747
02:50:37,300 --> 02:50:46,700
people are now like really worried at the moment because if
you guys didn't know Gabe the reason why steam is because

2748
02:50:46,700 --> 02:50:53,780
like um every time like the i think like the shareholders or
like stock people are or like who like the board tells them

2749
02:50:53,780 --> 02:51:05,320
to do something gab is like no off he's like because they're
like people will be like no you should do this gabe we will

2750
02:51:05,320 --> 02:51:16,250
have more profit and gabe is just like no fuck yeah it's a
private company yeah it's like a private company so he's

2751
02:51:16,250 --> 02:51:21,690
just like i'm not gonna there's no i'm not gonna worry about
that because we're like no if you do this this you do my

2752
02:51:21,690 --> 02:51:28,550
there's gonna be more money involved but gabe doesn't care
he just wants to do a game like he wants to like uphold his

2753
02:51:28,550 --> 02:51:36,990
philosophy when it comes to games and um and that's what
people are like really worried about too yeah there's no

2754
02:51:36,990 --> 02:51:44,290
board but i'm saying like i'm saying like if they're like
people are like encouraging him to to like people

2755
02:51:44,290 --> 02:51:50,850
encouraging him to do that but he always rejects it he
always says no and and that's what people are really worried

2756
02:51:50,850 --> 02:51:58,330
right now because they're like obviously if gabe steps down
or like he's not the ceo anymore like people are like oh no

2757
02:51:58,330 --> 02:52:05,830
like is it gonna go public is steam gonna become is steam
gonna become public because we don't know we don't know

2758
02:52:05,830 --> 02:52:17,330
who's gonna succeed him um it's just it's it's scary it's so
scary because like what like oh man like what's gonna happen

2759
02:52:17,330 --> 02:52:23,610
to the gaming market too everyone's like really worried
right now i saw like so many articles talking about it being

2760
02:52:23,610 --> 02:52:33,170
like uh just like oh what is gabe what's gonna happen to
steam after gabe steps down um hey thank you for the super

2761
02:52:33,170 --> 02:52:33,690
chat Thank you.

2762
02:52:33,770 --> 02:52:34,070
Thank you.

2763
02:52:34,350 --> 02:52:36,910
I can't even see the ending because I missed a chance.

2764
02:52:37,350 --> 02:52:40,670
Imagine that for hundreds of full price games.

2765
02:52:40,910 --> 02:52:41,030
Thank you.

2766
02:52:41,130 --> 02:52:42,210
Thank you.

2767
02:52:42,210 --> 02:52:42,770
Thank you.

2768
02:52:43,130 --> 02:52:47,450
I know it's actually really scary for the for the future of
gaming.

2769
02:52:47,990 --> 02:52:53,230
If Steam becomes like public, I think it'll be like really
it might.

2770
02:52:53,350 --> 02:52:54,650
It's going to be really weird.

2771
02:52:58,790 --> 02:52:59,890
It's going to be weird.

2772
02:53:00,110 --> 02:53:03,290
I was so sad when they took down the Infinity.

2773
02:53:03,370 --> 02:53:14,810
train I actually the infinity train has to be like one of my
most favorite animated shows it's so well done and like

2774
02:53:14,810 --> 02:53:24,130
there's no way to watch it legally because they they
actually wiped infinity infinity train off the internet like

2775
02:53:24,130 --> 02:53:35,710
for legal means of watching it and it's like um the lore for
it was so interesting i really like the lore um and there's

2776
02:53:35,710 --> 02:53:44,830
like there's so many like animated shows too that that like
they took down and everything uh it's not yeah it's a scary

2777
02:53:44,830 --> 02:53:53,550
thing to go full digital because you just don't know when
something's just gonna be gone because there's no there was

2778
02:53:53,550 --> 02:54:00,090
no physical copies of infinity train yeah they removed it
for tax I don't understand.

2779
02:54:00,970 --> 02:54:07,270
I'm not smart enough to understand like why they remove
things for tax purposes.

2780
02:54:07,930 --> 02:54:16,370
Because I feel like the government shouldn't like I feel
like the government shouldn't you know endorse stuff like

2781
02:54:16,370 --> 02:54:16,990
that.

2782
02:54:21,370 --> 02:54:22,450
I don't know.

2783
02:54:23,430 --> 02:54:24,610
I don't know.

2784
02:54:24,730 --> 02:54:26,430
I just feel like you know

2785
02:54:29,570 --> 02:54:35,050
be pushing for, you know, writing things off for tax
purposes.

2786
02:54:35,830 --> 02:54:36,410
But I don't know.

2787
02:54:36,490 --> 02:54:37,310
Maybe they get bribed.

2788
02:54:37,450 --> 02:54:37,910
Who cares?

2789
02:54:38,230 --> 02:54:39,430
No, I mean, I care.

2790
02:54:39,730 --> 02:54:42,810
But, like, at that point, it feels like you're at this rate.

2791
02:54:45,030 --> 02:54:45,490
Thanks.

2792
02:54:45,490 --> 02:54:46,430
Thank you for the super chat.

2793
02:54:46,530 --> 02:54:46,730
Thank you.

2794
02:54:46,810 --> 02:54:47,290
Thank you.

2795
02:54:47,430 --> 02:54:48,750
And we go all digital.

2796
02:54:48,810 --> 02:54:50,870
And a really bad solar storm hits.

2797
02:54:51,190 --> 02:54:52,850
We're all going to be screwed.

2798
02:54:52,950 --> 02:54:53,870
Thank you for the super chat.

2799
02:54:53,990 --> 02:54:54,350
Thank you.

2800
02:54:54,390 --> 02:54:55,290
Thank you.

2801
02:54:57,050 --> 02:54:59,490
I'm still really sad.

2802
02:54:59,510 --> 02:55:10,990
about uh i'm so really sad about the wally versus acne movie
not being l did you hear about that like okay i always talk

2803
02:55:10,990 --> 02:55:20,990
about it but like the recent update was that apparently the
wally versus acne uh the movie um they said that oh what's

2804
02:55:20,990 --> 02:55:28,870
his name i really like this actor the what was his the main
actor the one of the main actor in that movie was like okay

2805
02:55:28,870 --> 02:55:35,570
i understood it was like i watched a movie and it was will
was it was will arnette was it no not will arnette god it's

2806
02:55:35,570 --> 02:55:44,230
one of the wills will forte sorry why are every why is every
comedian will it's like every hollywood actor is named chris

2807
02:55:44,230 --> 02:55:51,150
but this time every comedian is named will will pharaoh will
forte will Arnett.

2808
02:55:51,690 --> 02:55:52,530
Anyway, Will Forte.

2809
02:55:53,030 --> 02:55:55,750
He was the main actor for it.

2810
02:55:56,470 --> 02:55:56,950
Why?

2811
02:55:59,250 --> 02:56:00,890
Coyote, like, in the movie.

2812
02:56:01,590 --> 02:56:10,730
And then, and then he was like, I watched the movie and I
thought they took it down because it was a fucking terrible

2813
02:56:10,730 --> 02:56:11,090
movie.

2814
02:56:11,510 --> 02:56:14,630
And Will Forte has been in a lot of terrible movies.

2815
02:56:14,950 --> 02:56:18,750
So, like, I trust his opinion on what is a terrible movie.

2816
02:56:19,330 --> 02:56:25,690
And, like, no offense to him, but he's been in a lot of them
because as a common comedian, you're in a lot of terrible

2817
02:56:25,690 --> 02:56:32,290
movies as a comedian, and like at that point, a paycheck is
a paycheck, and it's very hard to write a good comedy.

2818
02:56:32,590 --> 02:56:37,650
To write a good comedy movie, you actually have to be like
really smart.

2819
02:56:37,750 --> 02:56:47,350
Like I feel like a good comedian is, um, uh, has to be like
incredibly smart in order to write something actually funny

2820
02:56:47,350 --> 02:56:53,910
uh anyway oh wait sorry while you kind of anyway as i was
saying and then he was tweeted out and he's like i don't

2821
02:56:53,910 --> 02:57:00,630
understand why this movie is getting written up because this
movie is actually really fucking good so i'm like why

2822
02:57:00,630 --> 02:57:11,630
fucking delete any of the other other fucking cartoon shows
or movies for tax purposes the loony tunes is like one of

2823
02:57:11,630 --> 02:57:23,290
your biggest properties like everybody loves the loony tunes
why would you do this who cares about okay but who honestly

2824
02:57:23,290 --> 02:57:33,010
cares about the new velma season 2 everybody watched velma
to hate watch it like honestly

2825
02:57:36,810 --> 02:57:44,050
the only reason why velma was doing so fucking well was
because people were just hate watching it And they just

2826
02:57:44,050 --> 02:57:46,390
wanted to like live tweet their hate for the show.

2827
02:57:46,830 --> 02:57:50,010
And they weren't actually watching it because they like it.

2828
02:57:52,790 --> 02:57:56,910
It was like a train wreck that people couldn't take their
eyes off.

2829
02:57:57,230 --> 02:58:00,070
So people were like, oh my God, I hate this show so much.

2830
02:58:00,230 --> 02:58:05,050
But I'm not going to stop watching it because I want to know
what they're going to do next.

2831
02:58:05,110 --> 02:58:07,350
That's going to make me hate it even more.

2832
02:58:13,530 --> 02:58:22,070
anyway but yes i'm still i'm still so upset that i just want
to watch wally wally coyote versus acne because it just

2833
02:58:22,070 --> 02:58:27,990
seems like such a good fucking it just seems like such a
good movie i really love looney tunes in general i i

2834
02:58:27,990 --> 02:58:36,730
honestly loved that um oh which one except for space jam 2
that was just i can't believe space jam 2 didn't get

2835
02:58:36,730 --> 02:58:53,340
cancelled for tax purposes like that was my that was just
nostalgia beating but I I know like it might be a hot take

2836
02:58:53,340 --> 02:59:03,840
but I really I actually really enjoyed um fuck what was that
movie called I watched it like several times because I

2837
02:59:03,840 --> 02:59:11,480
actually really enjoyed it back in action I actually really
liked Looney Tunes back in action I know when it came out it

2838
02:59:11,480 --> 02:59:20,220
had like really shitty reviews but it's I personally thought
it was a good movie I thought it was fun I thought it was

2839
02:59:20,220 --> 02:59:30,340
yeah but when it came out when that movie came out it was a
box off like was it um it was not good it like reviews were

2840
02:59:30,340 --> 02:59:43,320
fucking terrible and um it did not make back its money it
did not make back its money at all um but I enjoyed it as a

2841
02:59:43,320 --> 02:59:50,020
as a And I watched, re-watch it several times on DVD.

2842
02:59:50,620 --> 02:59:51,820
And it was a fun movie.

2843
02:59:51,900 --> 02:59:52,720
Yeah, it flopped.

2844
02:59:53,200 --> 02:59:54,260
It actually flopped.

2845
02:59:54,500 --> 02:59:56,340
But I think it was pretty good.

2846
02:59:56,420 --> 02:59:57,580
I thought it was pretty good.

2847
02:59:58,380 --> 03:00:00,360
But I actually really enjoyed Looney Tunes in general.

2848
03:00:00,500 --> 03:00:03,280
So I'm just really sad that we don't have new Looney Tunes
stuff.

2849
03:00:03,600 --> 03:00:05,480
Anyway, I've been yapping a lot.

03:00:09,860 --> 03:00:10,260
