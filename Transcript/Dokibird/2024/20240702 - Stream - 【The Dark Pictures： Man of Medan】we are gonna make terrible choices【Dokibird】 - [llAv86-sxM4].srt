1
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,440
Hey... Why are you laughing?

2
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:54,680
No, when I say swap!

3
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:58,720
What?

4
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,880
What did I say?

5
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,200
Nothing!

6
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,040
Nothing!

7
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,900
What did I say?

8
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:04,680
I just said...

9
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,560
You've been like dealing with this for years now.

10
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,320
Why now do you laugh?

11
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:09,960
Why?

12
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:14,340
Nothing!

13
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:15,340
Nothing!

14
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,680
Hi guys!

15
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,080
Hey everybody!

16
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:26,640
So first off, I just want you guys to know we were selling technical difficulties for at least 30 minutes.

17
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,860
Oh my god, we were so prepared.

18
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,460
Yeah, we were so prepared guys.

19
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:38,060
It was just very unfortunate that the last five minutes that we had, like just something came up unexpectedly.

20
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,300
It was crazy.

21
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,120
Oh yeah, and it was on Min's side, not on mine.

22
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:43,320
No, wait, wait, wait.

23
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,500
I plead mac and cheese, you plead Germany.

24
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,520
Wait, what?

25
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:53,480
What about that?

26
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,280
Yeah, okay look.

27
00:02:55,460 --> 00:03:05,860
The reason why I didn't start and Min started before me was because Dokkaebi, we had to connect to a special server to be there.

28
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,060
And I forgot I was connected to that special server.

29
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:12,460
So I was streaming over at Germany.

30
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:19,800
So someone out there was watching the starting screen in Germany and being like, where did this person come from?

31
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,680
It was like Grandpa Joe just trying to watch Jeopardy.

32
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,200
And he was like...

33
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:30,060
The worst part was the starting screen was not even playing.

34
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:31,480
It was just a still image.

35
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:35,740
So he must be freaking out right now and being like aliens or some shit.

36
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,800
Like, Martha!

37
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,380
The TV won't swap!

38
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:42,180
The TV!

39
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:42,440
Wait, how do you know?

40
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,420
How do you say that in German?

41
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,680
When do you think I know German?

42
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:50,340
Well, you were, okay, you were mis-invited to a German convention.

43
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:54,040
Look, I would say an European convention.

44
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,400
It is a convention for all of EU.

45
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,740
Europe is not just German mint.

46
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:01,200
Wow.

47
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:02,940
You gotta open your mind.

48
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,600
It was in Germany!

49
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:12,420
Yeah, you gotta open your mind and be more inclusive to the other countries in Europe.

50
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,420
Okay, name every country in Europe.

51
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:17,340
Alright.

52
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:20,500
European Union.

53
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,420
Who's not in the European Union?

54
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,300
Well, then they're not European and...

55
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,080
I'm joking!

56
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,640
Guys, that was a joke, guys.

57
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,580
That was a joke, everybody.

58
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:41,500
Wow, and now she's lumping everyone in Europe under the European Union.

59
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,040
Wow.

60
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,840
No one can have individuality here.

61
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:50,660
Oh yeah?

62
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,980
You name every country in Europe then.

63
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,780
I already asked you.

64
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:59,840
Yeah, but you're like, oh, you're ragging me on about my lack of European knowledge.

65
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,080
You think I know?

66
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,120
I don't know, then why are you ragging me?

67
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,680
I could have named random countries and you wouldn't know because you don't know Europe apparently.

68
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,980
Okay, name three countries and I'll tell you which one is real.

69
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,880
Oh, you're gonna play that?

70
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,160
Alright, give me a sec.

71
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,220
Oh no, she has to Google.

72
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,120
Give me a sec, alright.

73
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,620
I also have Google.

74
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,560
You gotta Google.

75
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,580
That's not knowing the answer if you're Googling.

76
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,220
I don't know.

77
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,480
Alright.

78
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,120
Oh, what are you Googling, huh?

79
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:46,300
What are you Googling?

80
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:46,720
I'm Googling...

81
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,980
Countries of the world.

82
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,980
No, I said nice things.

83
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:52,140
I Googled nice things to send to my mom.

84
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:53,600
Guys.

85
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,040
Wait a sec.

86
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:59,060
Oh, so you're not even prioritizing the stream.

87
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,240
Yeah, yeah.

88
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:03,000
I'm waiting on you, Toki.

89
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,260
You're the one holding us up.

90
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,200
Alright, alright, alright.

91
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:05,780
Fine, fine.

92
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:06,200
Okay.

93
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:06,980
Faso.

94
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,080
Why are you laughing?

95
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:11,820
Wait, what?

96
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,280
Peso?

97
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:13,300
Yeah, Faso.

98
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:14,820
Malawi.

99
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:16,640
Eritrea.

100
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,480
Which one's the fake?

101
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:19,680
Which one?

102
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,040
The third one?

103
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:24,760
Eritrea.

104
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,940
I would like to phone a friend.

105
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,120
You don't know either!

106
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,820
You don't know either!

107
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,740
They were all real!

108
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:36,960
I'm so sorry!

109
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,640
They were all real!

110
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,900
They were all in Africa!

111
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:46,560
You said you know every country in the world.

112
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,660
So I gave you every country in the world.

113
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,800
I gave you specific... You don't know any African countries.

114
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,820
That's fucked up.

115
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:59,720
I know some.

116
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,760
I know Zanzibar.

117
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:06,940
I gave you three and you couldn't even tell which one was mine.

118
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,520
Which one was the real one?

119
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,000
But they were all real!

120
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,900
You said... You said Europe!

121
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,040
Yeah, you went with countries in the entire world.

122
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,580
So I was like, entire world, huh?

123
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,660
Okay, entire world!

124
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,700
Oh my god.

125
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:22,100
This is... This is slander.

126
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,420
Oh my god.

127
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,220
Anyway, should we play the game?

128
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,040
Okay.

129
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,340
I'm over playing GeoGuessr.

130
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,860
Alright, we're playing GeoGuessr now.

131
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,380
You're right.

132
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:42,360
I should have selected South America country.

133
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,080
Oh yeah?

134
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:49,480
How many countries have you been to in South America?

135
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:52,660
Like... zero?

136
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:57,340
How about you, huh?

137
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,780
I think it's just a few minutes of America.

138
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:00,320
I've been to one!

139
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:00,900
Yeah?

140
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:01,800
Which one was it?

141
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:02,740
Argentina!

142
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,080
Oh yeah.

143
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:10,940
Yeah, but you were there for like one second.

144
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,300
Does that really count?

145
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,500
No!

146
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:13,500
No!

147
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,620
I talked to the locals.

148
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,660
And they said, Papa Frita is so small.

149
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,520
That's all you got from it?

150
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,420
What's the fucking context?

151
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:34,840
I was eating really small fries from McDonald's at the airport.

152
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:38,100
So they were like making fun of you?

153
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:40,440
Yeah, they were.

154
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,380
She was like, I need to take a picture of this.

155
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,980
You're eating the small fries.

156
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,780
So I turned up mid a little bit, guys.

157
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:50,660
I turned her up.

158
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,860
So you guys can hear her better.

159
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,640
It's not like she's giving us any good input or anything, but at least you can hear her.

160
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,000
I'm gonna come over.

161
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:03,260
I'm gonna send you to Brazil.

162
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:05,220
We're gonna go to Brazil together.

163
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,800
We're gonna go to Brazil, guys!

164
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,960
Don't get mad at her coming to Brazil!

165
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,680
Brazil, my chick!

166
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:16,780
Alright.

167
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:18,760
Alright, are we ready?

168
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:25,960
So apparently we found out that we can actually potentially kill people in this game.

169
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:31,520
And like, if any of that actually happens...

170
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,260
Oh god.

171
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:37,000
Wait, so if like my characters die, do I just stop playing the game?

172
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,800
I think you just take over a different character.

173
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:41,480
Maybe?

174
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,480
Okay, maybe.

175
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,040
Maybe?

176
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:43,620
I don't know.

177
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:44,340
We'll find out.

178
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:47,040
I guess we'll see when you kill off your character.

179
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,740
Also, there's QuickTime events, by the way.

180
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,820
Do you know that?

181
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,140
Basically like until dawn.

182
00:09:56,460 --> 00:10:00,420
Yeah, and then my chat was like, oh, Min and QuickTime events.

183
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,260
What the hell does that mean?

184
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,280
What's that supposed to mean?

185
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:05,380
I don't know.

186
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,340
I don't know.

187
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,280
I'm good with the QuickTime.

188
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:10,440
I wonder if I should play this with a controller.

189
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,760
Oh, because I am.

190
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:13,860
Oh, you are?

191
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,240
Yeah.

192
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:14,980
Okay, I'm gonna grab my controller.

193
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,040
Yeah, I feel like this game is meant to be.

194
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,940
Until Dawn was meant to be played on a controller.

195
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,400
You're right.

196
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:21,260
Hold on.

197
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,100
Okay, I'm good.

198
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:24,820
Isn't this the creators of Until Dawn?

199
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:25,800
I'm pretty sure.

200
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,080
I think so.

201
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,540
Yeah, so it was meant to play.

202
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:29,340
Alright, you guys ready?

203
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,020
New slot.

204
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:30,380
I'm ready.

205
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:33,140
Oh, I want to be Joe or Charlie.

206
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,600
Guys, which one has a higher chance of living?

207
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,760
Joe, Joe Schmo, Joe Schmo.

208
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,020
Joe Schmo, Charlie Warley.

209
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:46,800
Charlie Warley.

210
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,080
Joey.

211
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,900
He believes in the heart of the cards.

212
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,300
Okay, oh, you're right.

213
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,020
I'm gonna be Joe.

214
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:55,820
I identify with Joey.

215
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,460
Just kidding.

216
00:10:58,460 --> 00:10:59,260
Joey's a wimp.

217
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,440
I'm ready.

218
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:01,700
I'm ready.

219
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:02,760
I'm ready, Charlie.

220
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,040
I handle your Charlie.

221
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,560
I'm Mint Phantom.

222
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,100
For now.

223
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:15,440
Okay.

224
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,200
Alright, here we go.

225
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:18,480
Wait.

226
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,920
To play with the controller, press A.

227
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:20,260
Okay.

228
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:21,520
Okay, that's cool.

229
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,840
That'd be funny if we're like, you can only play with one.

230
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:28,560
The other has to do M and K.

231
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,280
Oh my god.

232
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,680
That would be torture.

233
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:34,600
Man of Madon.

234
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:36,920
Madon?

235
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:37,580
Madon?

236
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:38,320
What is it?

237
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,660
You don't know either.

238
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,380
It's like a Madan, right?

239
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,660
It is Madon.

240
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:47,640
Okay, to be fair, everybody knows I pronounce things wrong 99% of the time.

241
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:48,720
So maybe you're right.

242
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:49,160
That's gonna be you.

243
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,460
That's gonna be you in that box.

244
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:50,500
That's me.

245
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,100
Oh wait, in that box?

246
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:52,620
You're dead.

247
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,020
I know.

248
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:54,600
That's bad.

249
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,400
That's bad.

250
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,260
That's bad.

251
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:58,140
Oh!

252
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,120
Ooh!

253
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:02,940
Elvis Presley.

254
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,140
I bet like, oh my god.

255
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,020
Are we coming back from the war?

256
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:09,480
I guess so.

257
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:10,400
What war though?

258
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,940
There's a lot in America.

259
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,700
There are so many choices.

260
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:16,120
I don't know.

261
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:16,680
It doesn't give us a date.

262
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:17,320
Yeah.

263
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,920
But this is, you know this is based on like a real ship, right?

264
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:20,880
Wait, it is?

265
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,600
Wait, this is based off real life?

266
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:23,520
Yeah.

267
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:26,520
Yeah, they found a ship that like everybody died on.

268
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:27,040
Oh!

269
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,660
And they couldn't figure out why they all died.

270
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,840
Doki Bird is Joe!

271
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,040
That's right!

272
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:41,040
The director called me up to act on this movie game.

273
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,100
That's you, Charlie!

274
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,180
Well, I'm wasted.

275
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:46,800
Yeah, you're so drunk.

276
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,220
Oh no, Charlie.

277
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,440
There's no subtitles.

278
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,260
Oh yeah, you turn it on yourself.

279
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,160
I turn mine on.

280
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,500
Guys, I have subtitles.

281
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,100
Wait, how do I turn it on?

282
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,820
I guess we'll find... you'll have to find out after this scene.

283
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:05,580
Wisp!

284
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:06,880
I have subtitles.

285
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,340
Look at it, she's hot.

286
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,340
Oh my god, he's fighting that thing.

287
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,620
Kick his ass.

288
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,520
Oh wait, this is me!

289
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,260
Oh my god.

290
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:18,880
Punch!

291
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:19,840
What are you gonna do?

292
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:20,200
Punch!

293
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,460
R to aim?

294
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,140
R to aim?

295
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:22,600
T to punch.

296
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:24,620
Punch?

297
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,140
Can I punch this thing?

298
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:29,140
Use R to choose... can I like move it for you?

299
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:29,880
Oh, I can!

300
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:31,280
You can?

301
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:31,880
Yeah!

302
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,660
Can you not move it?

303
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,060
Wait, I am moving it.

304
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:36,660
No, you're not.

305
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:37,580
I'm moving it.

306
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:38,980
No, I'm moving it.

307
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,020
I'm moving it.

308
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:40,880
This is totally me!

309
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,620
No, you're not?

310
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:43,120
Okay.

311
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:46,200
I wanna know, will I be rich?

312
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:46,740
Oh my god, me!

313
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:49,340
Wait, how do I pick?

314
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,600
How do I pick?

315
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,200
I'm killing it, I'm killing it, I'm killing it!

316
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,080
What are you doing?

317
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:56,840
I'm doing QTEs!

318
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:57,260
I'm QTEs!

319
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:59,880
Oh, we're doing different things!

320
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,520
Wait, why can't I pick?

321
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:02,760
Oh.

322
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:04,480
Why'd you buy the game?

323
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:05,920
Don't you have to...

324
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,780
Wait, yeah, you go do your fucking settings.

325
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,880
Yeah, hold on, I'm doing my subtitles.

326
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:13,140
Oh, you're actually doing it?

327
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:13,960
Yeah.

328
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:17,980
Yeah, I'm doing my subtitles.

329
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:18,620
Okay, we're good.

330
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:19,540
Continue.

331
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:20,720
I'm ready.

332
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:21,460
Okay.

333
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:22,960
Four, three, two...

334
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:23,640
Now you threw off my groove.

335
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:25,580
Oh, wait, you're fighting?

336
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,320
Yes, I'm fighting!

337
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,200
Oh.

338
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,360
Wait, I can't press anything!

339
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:31,140
Wait!

340
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,720
It wasn't a pick!

341
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,120
You should've picked Charlie!

342
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,200
You should've picked Charlie!

343
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:35,260
Okay.

344
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:36,680
Wait, I didn't turn you off anyway.

345
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,200
This gives me a chance to turn you off anyway.

346
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:41,800
Oh my god.

347
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,220
Okay.

348
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:42,960
How do I pick?

349
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:43,080
How do I pick?

350
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:43,360
I'm continuing thinking.

351
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:43,940
Okay.

352
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:45,480
I'm pressing B!

353
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:49,040
Yeah, it's my QTEs!

354
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,500
What's R?

355
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,580
It's not letting me pick!

356
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,940
I swear, I'm pressing everything!

357
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:58,660
Yeah, because I'm the one who's playing!

358
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:01,240
No, I have my own screen!

359
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,160
I have my own...

360
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,040
I don't know what's going on in your side!

361
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:08,540
I'm playing now!

362
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:13,530
It's not letting me pick!

363
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:15,570
I'm pressing everything!

364
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:16,190
Can you help me in English?

365
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,110
You suck at the game!

366
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:18,790
I already beat it.

367
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:21,430
Oh, you're already done?

368
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:22,930
Okay guys, I didn't say anything.

369
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:26,390
Wait... were you playing like a game of cards?

370
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:30,770
I was trying to do the dialogue section, but I couldn't pick a dialogue.

371
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:37,730
I was gaming... and you were dying to some old man who's asleep.

372
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:44,030
Oh wait, now I have to do the thing you just did.

373
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:46,510
Oh, you were doing this.

374
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:51,170
Were you able to pick a tile?

375
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:54,750
You were doing this and you were freaking out?

376
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:56,490
I picked it.

377
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:57,810
What did you press?

378
00:15:58,570 --> 00:15:59,890
You just move with R.

379
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:02,470
Yeah, but how did you select it?

380
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:05,670
Oh, I'm gonna use the rooster tile.

381
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:08,070
You just hover over it.

382
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,690
You just hover over it?

383
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:10,510
That's all you did?

384
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,390
That's literally it?

385
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:19,770
Yes, you're wrong too.

386
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:23,390
It wasn't just press R.

387
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:24,350
You just hover.

388
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:26,510
You just hover.

389
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:26,990
Oh wait.

390
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:29,810
Oh my god.

391
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:32,230
I don't know anything about my son.

392
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:34,510
What about my son?

393
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:37,810
I don't think you'll never know.

394
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,130
I'll never know.

395
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:41,890
I'll never know about my son.

396
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:44,010
Or if I'll ever be rich.

397
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:47,150
I'll never know.

398
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:48,830
I just did nothing.

399
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:51,770
I feel like it's hard to balance the audio in this.

400
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:56,650
He's told me like... blood.

401
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:00,930
Oh, are you done?

402
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:01,790
Yeah, I'm done.

403
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:04,550
You don't need to know anything more about your future.

404
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:07,050
If I don't know my future, you don't know your future.

405
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:08,570
Did you beat the dummy?

406
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:10,110
Yeah, I beat the dummy.

407
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:11,550
I did it faster than you.

408
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:12,770
Did you get hit?

409
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:13,310
No.

410
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:16,990
Did you get hit on the quick time events?

411
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:17,990
I don't believe you.

412
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:18,770
Did you get hit on the...

413
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:19,590
No, I did not.

414
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:21,910
Did you get hit on the quick time events?

415
00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:24,490
If anybody's dying, it's on your side.

416
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:28,610
No, I got an achievement for it.

417
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:30,830
I got an achievement.

418
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:33,070
I think all of us get an achievement for finishing it.

419
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:36,670
Oh shit, the death box.

420
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:39,150
That's gonna be you.

421
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:44,410
I mean, judging by the quick time events stuff, I think it's you.

422
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:46,330
Don't write death, POV.

423
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:53,490
I might not make right dialogue.

424
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:55,250
See, we got our strengths.

425
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:58,350
I'm the quick time event person and you're the dialogue person.

426
00:17:58,650 --> 00:17:59,970
Wait, why are there three boxes of death?

427
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:01,690
Wait, who's the third person?

428
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:03,090
Uh oh, it's chat.

429
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:04,210
It's chat.

430
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:06,230
Wait, one of our chats survives.

431
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:08,230
Uh oh.

432
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:09,170
Oh, who's that guy?

433
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:09,550
Hey man.

434
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,860
Where's my 50 cents?

435
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:15,960
What?

436
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,440
50 cents.

437
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,060
Yeah, I was like, what 50 cents?

438
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:18,960
Come on man.

439
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:22,040
Man, you don't need 50 cents.

440
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,140
You stole my 50 cents.

441
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:24,660
Whoa!

442
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,680
That's the third guy.

443
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,120
No, that was you.

444
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,560
You just got punched by a dude.

445
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,360
Audio

446
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:37,640
is like so...

447
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,680
Why is it so loud?

448
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,200
Yeah, I know.

449
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,280
Why is the sound effect so loud?

450
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,020
Why are you dead already?

451
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:44,740
Come on.

452
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:44,880
I'm dead.

453
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:45,900
Like, what did I do?

454
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,320
You're the drunk one.

455
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,280
Like, hold it.

456
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,240
You are too.

457
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:50,980
You got punched in the face.

458
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:55,540
You're the one who punished me for fucking 50 cents and then I got punched?

459
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:56,560
Like...

460
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,580
Guys, it's not the game voice that's low.

461
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,260
It's the...

462
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:02,960
It's everything else is high.

463
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,260
Yeah, I think that.

464
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:05,480
Yeah.

465
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:09,040
I keep trying to like adjust it but it's like all over the place.

466
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:09,880
Okay.

467
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:10,100
Uh oh.

468
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:10,780
Uh oh.

469
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:11,680
Oh, there's the ship.

470
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:13,600
Whoa!

471
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:14,880
Oh, there's the ship.

472
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,440
Oh, no.

473
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,640
What the fuck?

474
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,100
Titanic moment.

475
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:22,600
It struck...

476
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:22,740
Oh.

477
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:23,900
Ew!

478
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:24,920
What is that?

479
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,660
That's some goo.

480
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,040
The death is leaking into the water.

481
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:30,340
Yeah.

482
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,500
Oh, no.

483
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:33,840
Frankenstein.

484
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,600
The new pandemic.

485
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:43,960
Did you guys know that Frankenstein... the reason his arms are stuck out is because he was supposed to be blind and they just wrote that out of the story but kept his arms sticking out.

486
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:44,860
So...

487
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:46,460
It's gotta mess up.

488
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,080
It's Frankenstein's monster.

489
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:50,700
Whatever.

490
00:19:55,340 --> 00:20:00,700
If you're gonna give a fact about Frankenstein, use the correct terminology.

491
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,060
Frankenstein's monster.

492
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,800
What the fuck?

493
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,320
Whoa!

494
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,760
What's going on?

495
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,480
Oh, I'm in the rig.

496
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,260
Mint is Charlie.

497
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:14,840
Oh, I'm in the rig.

498
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:15,640
There's you.

499
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:16,380
Where is Joe?

500
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:17,180
Oh, wait.

501
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,100
That's me.

502
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,600
Yeah, you're looking at yourself.

503
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:20,260
Oh, yeah.

504
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,020
I'm looking at myself.

505
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,440
Wait, where are you?

506
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,160
Wait, where are you?

507
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:23,800
I'm at the sickbay.

508
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,900
Okay, I paused it because I need it.

509
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:25,600
Why'd you pause?

510
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,100
Because I didn't just see audio!

511
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,420
The audio is fucked up!

512
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:30,320
You're right.

513
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:30,640
You're right.

514
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:30,700
You're right.

515
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,900
I'm putting the sound effects and the music down.

516
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:35,040
We do not need such high sound effects.

517
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,200
No, I'm gonna put it like 70.

518
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,760
I'm gonna put it at 72.

519
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:39,520
Yeah.

520
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:40,540
See?

521
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,260
You're welcome.

522
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:44,840
I'm gonna put it at 72.

523
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,520
What's an audio preset?

524
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,380
I have no idea.

525
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:47,940
I just put...

526
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:48,340
Oh, nevermind.

527
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:51,680
I turned down music and the sound effects.

528
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:52,120
Are you ready?

529
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:53,520
Hold on.

530
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,120
Alright, fine.

531
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:54,740
You can put...

532
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:55,700
You press continue then.

533
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:56,960
Oh, I'm pressing continue.

534
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:57,280
Oh.

535
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:59,240
Oh.

536
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:03,860
I'm pressing continue.

537
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:05,920
Oh.

538
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:05,940
Oh.

539
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:05,960
Oh.

540
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:06,000
Oh.

541
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:07,260
Oh.

542
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:15,760
Oh.

543
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:16,760
I'm pressing continue.

544
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:17,140
There we go.

545
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:17,480
Three.

546
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:18,460
Two.

547
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:19,640
One.

548
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:23,700
I guess people can use the settings thing to fuck each other over.

549
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:25,420
Oh, there's blood on the wall.

550
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:26,020
Wait.

551
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:26,620
There's blood on...

552
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:26,880
Oh, wait.

553
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:27,580
I got the med kit.

554
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:28,340
Don't worry.

555
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:28,800
I got you.

556
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:29,940
Okay.

557
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:30,860
It's not my blood.

558
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:34,000
Call an ambulance but not for real.

559
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:35,400
Okay.

560
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,640
I know where the blood came from.

561
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,140
I know where the blood came from.

562
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:38,460
Oh, wait.

563
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:39,740
I need to move me in my chat.

564
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:42,420
There's text that's on the right side.

565
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,080
Oh.

566
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:44,220
Okay.

567
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,400
Okay, I know where the blood came from.

568
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:47,940
Okay, hold on.

569
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:48,400
Oh, okay.

570
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:49,700
Oh, my bad.

571
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:50,500
Sorry.

572
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,080
I'm moving us over.

573
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,060
I'm moving us over.

574
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:53,920
I'm moving us over.

575
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,200
Chat, come over here, chat.

576
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:58,020
That's not a bad kid.

577
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,340
Chat, come here.

578
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,500
Oh, you guys are like censored to...

579
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,000
Oh, gosh.

580
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,040
You guys, don't worry about it.

581
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:10,380
Okay, sorry.

582
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,980
Five, four, three, two...

583
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:14,540
What?

584
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:15,220
Why?

585
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,480
So, there's a dead body on my side.

586
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,100
There's just blood on the wall here.

587
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:20,520
Let's see.

588
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:22,480
Oh, I'm looking at a key.

589
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:23,280
Oh!

590
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,440
Whoa!

591
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:25,860
What a key.

592
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:26,880
I have a key.

593
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,460
I'm just looking at blood.

594
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,640
Who is this?

595
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,900
Come get me out of here then, maybe.

596
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:32,640
Maybe that's for me to get out.

597
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,000
I need to see... wait, it's a doctor.

598
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:36,160
Is he dead?

599
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:39,840
Yes, I'm pretty sure he was stuffed in the locker.

600
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,160
I'm pretty sure he's dead.

601
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:43,860
Private Charles...

602
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:44,340
What happened?

603
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,320
Wait, what happened while I was sleeping?

604
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,540
While we were both sleeping?

605
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:51,880
Ooh, that's me.

606
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:52,900
Yeah, what the heck happened?

607
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,540
To Pops, come back soon.

608
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:57,340
Yeah, I'm pretty sure we weren't sleeping for that long.

609
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,420
Do you have a safe code?

610
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:03,040
I'm opening up a lock.

611
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:04,740
I'm coming out.

612
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:05,600
I'm coming out of the ship.

613
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:07,160
Out of the ship?

614
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,280
Where are you?

615
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,900
I'm outside the ship now.

616
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,680
Okay, I don't like how...

617
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,200
You don't know what's going on.

618
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,760
I'm stuck in the brig.

619
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:20,340
Oh my gosh, this is tank... oh, it's Resident Evil.

620
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,360
I'm stuck in the brig.

621
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:23,580
The brig?

622
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,420
Something's gonna pop out at me.

623
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:26,280
Oh...

624
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,740
Wait, is that you?

625
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:29,900
Are you in this side?

626
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:30,800
Well, yeah, that's me.

627
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,780
That's you, Charlie.

628
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,440
Just get me out of here already.

629
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,680
Oh, you were in detention for punching me.

630
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:38,760
You were in detention.

631
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:39,460
I didn't punch you.

632
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,580
I didn't punch you.

633
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:40,900
Oh, yeah?

634
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,280
Why were you locked inside?

635
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,660
I don't know...

636
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:46,220
Something's wrong.

637
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,580
Let's get out of here.

638
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,320
What are you looking at?

639
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:51,120
What is happening?

640
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:53,020
Find out what's happening on this ship.

641
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,320
Where are we gonna go?

642
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,260
Where are we gonna go?

643
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,540
Where are we gonna go, Charlie?

644
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,640
Charlie, where are we gonna go, Charlie?

645
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:01,960
This way?

646
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,260
I don't know.

647
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:06,420
Don't you know where we are?

648
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,120
I don't know.

649
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,480
Stuck in the wall.

650
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,920
You're stuck in the wall.

651
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,720
This way, this way!

652
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:14,260
Oh, go, Jory!

653
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:15,460
Oh, go, Jory!

654
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:17,920
What's that?

655
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:19,280
I don't know!

656
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:20,140
Run!

657
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:26,460
That's gonna be you.

658
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:27,500
What's that?

659
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,100
Press A in time with a harpy?

660
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:32,840
Okay.

661
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:35,460
If you don't get this right, I swear to God.

662
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,920
We fucked up!

663
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,520
You fucked up!

664
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,580
You fucked me!

665
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,060
You fucked me!

666
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,360
We were fine!

667
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,320
We were fine!

668
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,840
Where do we come from?

669
00:24:58,920 --> 00:24:59,400
Where do we go?

670
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,460
Where do we go?

671
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,240
Where do we come from?

672
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:06,460
Oh, wait, this is where we came from.

673
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:10,080
We just were like, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

674
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:10,720
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

675
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:15,040
Two bumbling guys, Charlie and Joe.

676
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:18,260
Charlie and Joe, the adventures of Charlie and Joe.

677
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,200
What is this?

678
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,020
How did you mess up that?

679
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,060
You just pressed A!

680
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:27,520
I wanted to see what would happen if he caught us.

681
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,860
Oh, yeah, yeah, you wanted to see what would happen.

682
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:31,800
He didn't shoot us, it's fine.

683
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,940
He was safe, he was safe.

684
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:37,140
Okay.

685
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,160
What the hell?

686
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:43,080
Okay, I'm gonna put settings up right now.

687
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:43,780
Okay, get ready.

688
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,820
I need to turn you up again.

689
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:45,780
Okay.

690
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:47,740
Settings time.

691
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:50,460
Yeah, yeah, I need it.

692
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:52,820
Okay, we both need to fix it, so that's fine.

693
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,600
Okay, I turned my sound effects to 60.

694
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,900
Why is the sound effects so loud?

695
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:01,000
I don't know.

696
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,820
Actually, I'm gonna turn mine down a little bit too.

697
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:06,320
Yeah, okay, I'm gonna turn you up a little bit.

698
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:10,060
And I'm turning the overall game a little bit.

699
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:11,480
Alright.

700
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,180
This should work.

701
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,960
Is this A Way Out or whatever that game is?

702
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,860
Well, it feels like it.

703
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:22,520
It's like the horror version of A Way Out.

704
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,600
Sorry, chat, you're cut off a little bit.

705
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:29,300
Let me...

706
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:31,020
Alright, here, I'm ready.

707
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:31,400
Are you ready?

708
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,940
Yeah, I already clicked ready.

709
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:35,340
Okay, I don't know that.

710
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,040
I can't see.

711
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:39,380
Five, four, three, two, one.

712
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,160
Okay.

713
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:41,800
Okay, here we go.

714
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,280
We're walking down the hall.

715
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:43,760
We're fine.

716
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:44,440
Wait, where did you go?

717
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:45,240
Oh, there you are.

718
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,340
Didn't we come here?

719
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,200
Who's that?

720
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,680
Who's that, Joe?

721
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:50,660
Did you not see it?

722
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,460
Charlie, did you not see it?

723
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:56,220
Charlie, did you not see the guy running in front of us?

724
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,680
No, there was no guy.

725
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,000
Wait, oh no, what's going on?

726
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,180
What are you talking about?

727
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:03,560
Charlie, I think I'm still drunk.

728
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,280
Joe, take your meds.

729
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,060
Joe, take your meds.

730
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:08,140
I caught it.

731
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:08,860
The doctor's dead.

732
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,280
There's a door flashing over there.

733
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:12,220
Yeah, yeah, over here.

734
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,040
Why are our feet smelly?

735
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:16,740
Ew.

736
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,600
Wait, did you not see it?

737
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,360
There's like a...

738
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:20,960
flashing over here.

739
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,500
I'm getting it.

740
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:23,580
Come on, Joe.

741
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:25,920
Help me.

742
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:28,220
I literally just came back from the sickbay.

743
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:30,940
Why is my face just so...

744
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:31,520
Alright, oh.

745
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:32,480
A!

746
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:34,840
I'm pressing A repeatedly!

747
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:35,480
I'm pressing A.

748
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,820
Yeah, he's dead.

749
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,580
Yeah, you said it.

750
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,300
Fubar and then some.

751
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:44,740
What the fuck?

752
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:46,580
Fubar and then some.

753
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:47,800
What does that even mean?

754
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:48,720
What does that mean?

755
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,060
Oh my god.

756
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,420
Oh, that's a lot of blood.

757
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:53,820
Are we getting invaded?

758
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:54,640
What's happening?

759
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:55,840
What happened on the ship?

760
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,520
Stays on the ship.

761
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:58,840
Oh, okay.

762
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,080
I'm first, I guess.

763
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:01,920
Even though I opened the door?

764
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,400
Our feet are really smelly.

765
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,400
Wait, why is there like gas on the floor?

766
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:07,480
That's what I'm saying!

767
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,100
We're smelly.

768
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,560
Another step.

769
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:11,420
Who's the lucky winner?

770
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:12,760
I'm checking him out.

771
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,860
I'm trying to check him out.

772
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,020
What do you see?

773
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:15,460
I'm stuck.

774
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:16,160
I'm stuck.

775
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:17,120
Oh, there it is.

776
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:18,940
What's going on?

777
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,180
What's going on?

778
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,380
He looks like Peter Griffin.

779
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,560
I wanna see too.

780
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,340
The bomb!

781
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,500
Oh my god, it's him!

782
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:30,920
He's not one of us.

783
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:31,860
Wait, what's wrong with his eyes?

784
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,180
He's like looking... he's like blank eyes.

785
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:35,040
Yeah.

786
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,700
What's going on, guys?

787
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,280
I feel like those like...

788
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:43,080
Like the frat boys be like...

789
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,500
Hey guys, what's going on?

790
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,400
What do we do?

791
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,240
Wow, look at these camera angles.

792
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:51,940
So cinematic.

793
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,420
Oh, did you went through that door?

794
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,040
I can't see anything.

795
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:55,560
Where are you?

796
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:56,340
I'm heading downstairs.

797
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,400
Oh my god, it is so cinematic.

798
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,720
I can't see where I'm going.

799
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:06,940
Oh, FUBAR is a military snack for fucked unbelievably beyond all recognition.

800
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:08,300
Woah!

801
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:08,900
Woah!

802
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:09,780
Oh my god!

803
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,120
To walk faster.

804
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,600
Okay, yeah, I like that.

805
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:13,780
Okay.

806
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,540
Alright, now we can... can we run?

807
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,720
I don't feel like I'm walking very much.

808
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:18,800
Me too.

809
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:19,620
I feel like...

810
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:21,880
I don't think I'm walking that fast.

811
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:22,760
Not gonna lie.

812
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:24,060
Me neither.

813
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:26,520
Are we... maybe we're not pressing the right button.

814
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,600
It's LB.

815
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:28,200
What are you...

816
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,580
I don't know.

817
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:30,660
There's one button.

818
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:31,340
Maybe it's wrong.

819
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,200
Which one is me?

820
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,580
Oh, this is me.

821
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:35,920
Woah!

822
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,140
Did you not see that?

823
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:39,320
No, I didn't see anything.

824
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,500
Oh, it's only me!

825
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,400
It was a child.

826
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:45,820
No.

827
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:46,720
Jo, what's wrong with you?

828
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:49,820
Of course you, Doki, would be the one.

829
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:51,000
The crazy one.

830
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:51,820
You would be the one.

831
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:52,820
You're so crazy.

832
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:54,940
So you're walking in circles.

833
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:56,260
You're just like, I don't know.

834
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,380
I don't know, Charlie.

835
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:58,560
I don't feel so good.

836
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:00,060
I don't feel so good, Charlie.

837
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:01,540
I'm seeing children.

838
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:02,760
I'm seeing children.

839
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:05,340
Oh!

840
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:07,460
Oh!

841
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:08,880
Oh my god.

842
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:11,860
Cow, cow, cow!

843
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:14,360
Uh oh.

844
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:14,940
I have a gun.

845
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:15,300
Is that a good idea?

846
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,020
Wait.

847
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,280
Why did I get a knife?

848
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:18,600
What the hell?

849
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,660
Why can't I ever have a gun?

850
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:23,760
You know why.

851
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,300
This is accurate.

852
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,940
This is very accurate.

853
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:30,760
Oh my god.

854
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,440
You were meant to have the katana.

855
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,820
I was meant to have the gun.

856
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:36,740
The katana.

857
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,320
Was that meme the guy...

858
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,220
I don't think you... You were having hallucinations.

859
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:43,880
I don't think you should be holding anything.

860
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,520
Is that you?

861
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:49,040
Is that you?

862
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:49,420
Is that you?

863
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:51,700
That's me.

864
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,920
I saw another child.

865
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,640
I saw a child again.

866
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:56,100
Yeah.

867
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,720
What the fuck do you see on your screen?

868
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,060
Oh!

869
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:02,500
The dead people are actually talking to me right now.

870
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,040
Oh, okay.

871
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:04,540
So at least we're not all...

872
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:05,820
We're both crazy then.

873
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:07,200
Oh!

874
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:07,400
What?

875
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:08,600
What just happened?

876
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,280
Oh god, no.

877
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,140
It's you talking to me.

878
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:12,780
Wait, what?

879
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,220
Yeah, you're looking at me.

880
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,360
But you're dead.

881
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:18,620
Uh, I'm gonna investigate.

882
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:20,100
Wait, how do I investigate?

883
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,080
How are you investigating?

884
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:22,160
I'm still hallucinating.

885
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:24,460
Um, I'm investigating your body.

886
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:30,180
Oh, there's a... There's a man here!

887
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:31,820
Wait, there's me!

888
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,100
No, I think you're the man.

889
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,060
Wait, what?

890
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:36,860
No, child!

891
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:37,780
I see the...

892
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:39,300
The child has your knife!

893
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,840
You gave the child the knife!

894
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,260
No, I still have it!

895
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:42,760
I still have it!

896
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:43,140
No!

897
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,220
I shot the child!

898
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,300
Oh my god!

899
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:47,660
I missed!

900
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:48,900
I saw a bit.

901
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:49,400
You missed?

902
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:50,580
You missed!

903
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,780
Are you shooting me?

904
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,060
I don't know, but I missed apparently.

905
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:00,820
Wait, did I die from that?

906
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:02,340
I think I'm dead too.

907
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:02,980
What?

908
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:04,000
What the...

909
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:07,700
Oh my god!

910
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:09,600
This guy used the force on me and killed me.

911
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:11,880
I tried...

912
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:15,460
I missed the child and then I died from a heart attack.

913
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:16,540
I tried...

914
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,080
I missed the child and then I died from a heart attack.

915
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,360
I just died from a...

916
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,680
You died from cringe because you were so bad.

917
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,280
You died from cringe, real.

918
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,280
You died from cringe, real.

919
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:31,320
Who is he?

920
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:31,780
Who is he?

921
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:33,060
That's not Charlie or Joe.

922
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,120
Give us your location.

923
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:35,780
Do it!

924
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:37,560
Do it, man!

925
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:38,520
You're our only hope!

926
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,400
Random sailor!

927
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:42,500
Uh oh.

928
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:45,360
Wait, what?

929
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:46,580
What the hell?

930
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:48,420
He has four arms!

931
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,540
Doki, I think something weird is going on here.

932
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,880
Yeah, I think this ship might be haunted.

933
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:57,920
He's got his little baby cross.

934
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,360
God cannot save you now!

935
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:04,420
Wait, what?

936
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:05,100
Woah!

937
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,480
Oh, he's...

938
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,360
He's dead!

939
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,540
Oh my god, he's dead!

940
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:13,120
Oh my god, he died of cringe too!

941
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:15,120
Everybody's dying of cringe!

942
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:17,240
Oh my god, it's so loud.

943
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,800
I cannot...

944
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:22,980
I like how they were like, picked between Joe and Charlie and they're already dead.

945
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,140
Yeah, that was the prologue!

946
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,520
We get the whole...

947
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,400
We get the game now.

948
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:32,240
Woah, woah, woah.

949
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,420
Woah, woah, woah.

950
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:39,820
Woah, woah, woah.

951
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,940
This isn't a ship.

952
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:42,920
We're at a mansion now.

953
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:43,260
Yay!

954
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:43,500
Yay!

955
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,460
Do they still make these games?

956
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,580
I don't know.

957
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:52,220
I know they're doing really bad right now.

958
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,060
I don't know.

959
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:53,880
I know they're doing really bad right now.

960
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:56,280
You know what?

961
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,740
I saw the reviews for it.

962
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:03,160
The newer episodes were not doing so well.

963
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:03,740
Uh oh.

964
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:07,400
Oh, who's this guy?

965
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,160
Isn't he the guy that was the...

966
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:12,780
Isn't he the guy that was the...

967
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:14,980
Oh, is he?

968
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,500
I don't know.

969
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:18,840
He could be.

970
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:19,320
I think so.

971
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:23,820
Oh, apparently we're gonna get a copyright strike because of this song.

972
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:24,540
Oh!

973
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,500
I'm turning it down.

974
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:27,440
Oh, you're turning it down?

975
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,520
It's okay, they're just gonna get our ad money.

976
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,220
That's alright.

977
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:33,400
Oh, yeah.

978
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:36,940
Look at the... the ring girl.

979
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:38,060
What is going on?

980
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:41,420
Like, where did she go?

981
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:43,100
Why is she there?

982
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:45,920
Is this like some paranormal activity?

983
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:47,260
I like...

984
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:54,440
Is this like the video game version of the Annabelle chip?

985
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:56,100
And the nun?

986
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,120
What were they called?

987
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,040
They had names.

988
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:00,680
They were like the couple that investigated paranormal activities.

989
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:01,500
Yeah, yeah.

990
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:04,160
Anne and Lorraine Warren or whatever.

991
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:04,660
Yeah, yeah.

992
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,720
What was the name of those movies called?

993
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,860
Wasn't it just Annabelle, right?

994
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:10,880
No, they had a name.

995
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:12,840
It was a series.

996
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:12,960
Oh, okay.

997
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:14,800
The Conjuring!

998
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:15,760
The Conjuring, yeah!

999
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,420
That's us!

1000
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:20,220
We're the Conjuring!

1001
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,580
We're the Conjuring!

1002
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:24,720
We're the Conjurers!

1003
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:26,260
Joe and Charlie.

1004
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:27,580
Who died.

1005
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:30,260
He's walking down his own hallway so dramatically.

1006
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:30,740
Yeah.

1007
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:33,440
Oh, now he's lighting candles.

1008
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:34,700
Hello.

1009
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:37,140
Is this the sound one?

1010
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,040
Yeah, thank you.

1011
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:40,600
Okay.

1012
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:44,820
His suppository?

1013
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,220
Is that the things you stick up your ass?

1014
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:48,460
I think so.

1015
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:56,260
If you're wondering why I know this, guys, it's because I watch a lot of doctor shows.

1016
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:59,320
Yeah, that's the only reason she knows.

1017
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,200
That's the only reason I know.

1018
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:03,980
Then why do you know it, huh?

1019
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,140
The curator of stories.

1020
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,580
You're not answering the question, man.

1021
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,560
Wait, what did you say?

1022
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,960
Why do you know what suppository is?

1023
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:16,100
Oh, because I watch the shows with you.

1024
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:16,620
Oh, true.

1025
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:17,200
Oh, yeah.

1026
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:17,900
You were there.

1027
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:19,520
Yeah.

1028
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:20,960
Yeah.

1029
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,160
He's breaking the fourth wall.

1030
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,020
He's talking to us.

1031
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:26,580
Yeah.

1032
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:30,900
Ha ha.

1033
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:31,960
Ha ha ha.

1034
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:33,760
No, I'm falling down.

1035
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:34,960
Snuffed out.

1036
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:36,780
Yeah.

1037
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,320
You see, we each make decisions according to our own moral compass.

1038
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,060
I think I have a great moral compass.

1039
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:45,780
You literally couldn't press A.

1040
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,160
Ha ha ha ha.

1041
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,800
It was a lot of pressure.

1042
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,020
Ha ha ha.

1043
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:54,340
It is the tax one pays for how we live.

1044
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:57,640
And it comes eventually to everybody.

1045
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:58,040
Eventually.

1046
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:02,060
Still, none of us want for it to come too soon.

1047
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,400
Yeah, Mint.

1048
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:04,640
Ha ha ha.

1049
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:05,980
Hey, hey, hey.

1050
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:06,780
I'm already dead.

1051
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:07,580
I fear nothing.

1052
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:09,840
Sometimes separately.

1053
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:15,380
What one does may not make complete sense to the other because we all have different perspectives.

1054
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:17,400
Yeah, anything you do makes no sense to me.

1055
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,560
Ha ha ha.

1056
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:20,400
And neither does you.

1057
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:22,980
That's why it's perfect.

1058
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:23,660
We're playing this.

1059
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:24,300
Yeah, it's perfect.

1060
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:28,680
I think the goal is to at least have one person survive.

1061
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:29,700
Probably.

1062
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:32,200
Who will it be?

1063
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:32,660
You or me?

1064
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:33,600
Ha ha ha.

1065
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:35,240
Here's one for free.

1066
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:35,840
Oh.

1067
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:40,140
There are pictures in this world that can show you some possible future.

1068
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:40,420
Oh.

1069
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:42,480
Oh, so it's like a hint.

1070
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:43,480
Yeah.

1071
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:47,040
They may just help you to make better decisions.

1072
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:47,760
Oh no.

1073
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:49,160
I think that's subjective.

1074
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,020
If they're better or not.

1075
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:53,480
Yeah, like how do we know if they're better decisions?

1076
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:54,620
Yeah.

1077
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:56,380
That's all for the moment.

1078
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,220
We'll talk again soon enough.

1079
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:02,780
We'll have the opportunity to account for all the actions that you've taken.

1080
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:03,840
Thank you, sir.

1081
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:04,580
Thank you.

1082
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:08,040
Do we need to pay you now?

1083
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:08,860
Or like...

1084
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:10,560
I don't know this guy.

1085
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:11,720
Is this a trial period?

1086
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,520
Oh, that's where we were.

1087
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:15,780
That's the opening screen.

1088
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:19,620
It was just the water.

1089
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:20,800
Ooh.

1090
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:21,780
Ooh.

1091
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:23,920
Doki Bird is Alex.

1092
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:25,700
You're Brad?

1093
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,200
I'm Brad.

1094
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:27,840
You're Brad.

1095
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:32,520
I'm probably really cool.

1096
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:33,740
Which one is this?

1097
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:36,660
Cool name, you know.

1098
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,740
Is this the Brad or the Alex?

1099
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,880
Oh, I look like a nerd.

1100
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,100
I'm your brother.

1101
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:46,900
We're brothers.

1102
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:48,040
Brad's brother.

1103
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,660
How do we always end up being brothers?

1104
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:52,560
Wait, which one?

1105
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:52,940
Is that you?

1106
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:53,540
Are you the nerd?

1107
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:54,660
Yes.

1108
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:55,960
Look at this nerd.

1109
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,240
Oh my god.

1110
00:38:58,020 --> 00:38:58,380
Winnie.

1111
00:38:58,380 --> 00:38:59,100
You're insecure.

1112
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,080
Brad's brother.

1113
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:02,620
Why does yours say innocent?

1114
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:05,000
What does that imply about me?

1115
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,420
I'm an innocent maiden.

1116
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:12,520
Down.

1117
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:14,720
Diving.

1118
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:17,840
Maybe you could show me how the pros do it.

1119
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:18,460
Ooh.

1120
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:21,900
Doki Bird is deciding.

1121
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:22,780
Let's see.

1122
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,380
You didn't take lessons?

1123
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:27,960
I'm not going to take lessons.

1124
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:29,840
Kind of.

1125
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:30,100
Yeah.

1126
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:34,140
You think I can just save you like that?

1127
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:36,720
I'm going to say nothing.

1128
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:38,340
I'm going to say nothing.

1129
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:39,240
That's right.

1130
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,160
Know your place, nerd.

1131
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,780
That cam is like super expensive.

1132
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:49,160
Oh yeah.

1133
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,140
Be cool.

1134
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:50,400
What?

1135
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:51,420
I'm an influencer.

1136
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,580
You're an influencer?

1137
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:54,820
Maybe.

1138
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:55,520
I don't know.

1139
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:56,220
I have a camera.

1140
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,640
So don't sweat the little stuff, man.

1141
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:58,240
It's not cool.

1142
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,620
Don't make me regret letting you tag along.

1143
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:01,100
Yeah.

1144
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,860
Don't make me regret it.

1145
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:04,560
Now you're deciding again.

1146
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:08,900
You know I'm not like the best around new people.

1147
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:10,240
Oh, you're anxious.

1148
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:13,220
We're excited, Winnie.

1149
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,440
We're excited, Winnie.

1150
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,800
We're excited, Winnie.

1151
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:20,980
We're buddies.

1152
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:21,960
Oh, wait.

1153
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:22,860
I can see your traits.

1154
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:25,240
Oh, that's what you're looking at.

1155
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,300
What was it?

1156
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:26,500
RB?

1157
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,560
Yeah, RB.

1158
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:29,460
Wait, we have secrets too.

1159
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,420
I can't see it since I'm in the closet.

1160
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:31,900
Oh my god.

1161
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:34,000
I'm guarded, genuine.

1162
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:36,780
I'm genuine, insecure, generous.

1163
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:37,740
Never mind.

1164
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,160
Who the fuck is Conrad and Fliss?

1165
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:42,280
We're not there yet.

1166
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,640
We're not there yet.

1167
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:44,620
We have other people.

1168
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:47,580
Alex reminded Brad he's not just a tag-a-log.

1169
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:50,860
Alex was annoyed that Brad had not taken diving lessons.

1170
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,320
Oh my god.

1171
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:52,880
Come on, John.

1172
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:53,980
I can't even see them.

1173
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,580
Now I'm gonna see it.

1174
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:58,760
Now you're gonna see it.

1175
00:40:58,760 --> 00:40:59,560
It's RB.

1176
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,660
It's collections and characters.

1177
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:06,280
That's what it was.

1178
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:06,820
I'm witty.

1179
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:07,740
I'm eager.

1180
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:08,740
I'm innocent.

1181
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:12,060
Yeah, but are you genuine like me?

1182
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,800
You're not genuine.

1183
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:14,600
My body is genuine.

1184
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:16,080
It literally says genuine.

1185
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,700
If you're not genuine...

1186
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:20,980
Oh, you can't see it.

1187
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:21,780
We can only see ourselves.

1188
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,720
Mine says guarded, generous.

1189
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:25,960
Genuine.

1190
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:27,980
Yeah, I'm...

1191
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:30,800
I mean, I let you come over to the diving...

1192
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,140
to the diving place.

1193
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:35,220
I could let you drown if I wanted to.

1194
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:37,460
You're my bro.

1195
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:38,920
You're my brother.

1196
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:40,120
See?

1197
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,000
I'm being supportive.

1198
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:42,100
We're buddies.

1199
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,340
I'm here to fucking hang.

1200
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:48,360
Cool out and kick it.

1201
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,980
Yeah, you gotta loosen up, bro.

1202
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:51,300
Let's just kick it and be legends, man.

1203
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,500
You're Apex Legends.

1204
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:57,360
Sorry I'm a little snappy.

1205
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:58,200
I'm just...

1206
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,360
When you're in medical school, it'd be stressful.

1207
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:00,780
What's wrong?

1208
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:02,740
I'm in medical school right now?

1209
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:05,360
Oh my god.

1210
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:09,340
At least I'm a cool nerd.

1211
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:12,620
You're a fucking influencer.

1212
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:14,600
It's been like two weeks.

1213
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:15,800
Come on, man.

1214
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:17,800
Right on cue.

1215
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:21,000
I'm smart and cool.

1216
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:21,860
What are you?

1217
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,200
I'm innocent.

1218
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:25,680
I'm innocent.

1219
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:28,520
I'm not gonna be a doctor.

1220
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:29,420
I'm gonna save lives.

1221
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:33,020
You need to save your own first.

1222
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:36,040
Can I get your input on something?

1223
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:36,720
Oh my god, I'm gonna propose.

1224
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:39,620
Oh, you are?

1225
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:41,620
Not a big thing I'm trying to make a decision about.

1226
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:43,460
Yeah?

1227
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:45,880
No, but...

1228
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:49,740
It's just kind of a big life choice, you know?

1229
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:50,720
Okay.

1230
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,600
I don't know what's the right thing to do.

1231
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:56,620
Oh my god, do I marry her or not?

1232
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:58,120
I'm gonna...

1233
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:59,160
say nothing.

1234
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,220
Wow, you're so supportive.

1235
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,000
Oh my god, that's my girlfriend!

1236
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:08,880
Julia!

1237
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:12,180
That's her brother!

1238
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:13,440
He's relaxed.

1239
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:14,420
He's a fool.

1240
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:17,200
Oh, yo, you want me to hook you up with her brother?

1241
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:20,540
Oh, wow.

1242
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:21,860
You like that?

1243
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:23,900
This is Alex.

1244
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:25,440
Hey, what's up man?

1245
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:25,860
Conrad.

1246
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:27,040
Yeah.

1247
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:27,740
Yeah.

1248
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:29,760
Lady killer, right here.

1249
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:30,360
What?

1250
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:31,420
That's me.

1251
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:32,580
He's ignoring you.

1252
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:35,120
This Conrad guy looks like...

1253
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:38,280
He looks like that actor.

1254
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,100
Doctor Horrible.

1255
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:42,300
Dr. Neopatric Harris?

1256
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:43,580
Yeah, Neopatric Harris.

1257
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:44,920
Do you miss me?

1258
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:46,320
Of course.

1259
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:48,680
I'm cracking a cold one!

1260
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:50,200
Every second.

1261
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:53,280
I love you.

1262
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:55,740
I'm gonna be cool.

1263
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:56,580
I'm gonna be cool, you guys.

1264
00:43:58,020 --> 00:43:58,580
No!

1265
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:00,920
She called me needy!

1266
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:05,820
I'm not needy, I swear!

1267
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:09,620
I think this is my first time having a beer.

1268
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,940
Are you cracking a beer?

1269
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:14,900
Yeah, I'm having a cold one.

1270
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:16,560
Oh, wait.

1271
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:18,580
I thought I was throwing up.

1272
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:21,120
I can't believe it.

1273
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:21,600
Wait, who's that?

1274
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:25,500
Who's this?

1275
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,040
This is my love interest now.

1276
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:28,800
Where's the old crusty?

1277
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:33,480
Captain of the Duke of Milan.

1278
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:34,860
Oh, dang.

1279
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:35,900
Oh, shit.

1280
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:36,920
Badass.

1281
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:38,140
Oh my gosh, did you see her tattoo?

1282
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:39,100
Yeah.

1283
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:42,180
I'd invite you to make yourselves at home, but...

1284
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:42,580
Uh...

1285
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:46,640
Why is everyone...

1286
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:47,200
Yeah.

1287
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:50,100
Isn't she the captain?

1288
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:51,200
Yeah.

1289
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:53,100
You don't know who's sailing the ship.

1290
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:55,940
Here we go.

1291
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:58,100
You're selling, I'm buying.

1292
00:44:58,240 --> 00:44:58,700
Whoa!

1293
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:00,960
Yeah, me too.

1294
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:03,140
Conrad, that's fucked up.

1295
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:08,120
Do not flirt with the person who knows how to drink.

1296
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:08,940
You gotta drive the boat.

1297
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:09,740
Yeah.

1298
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:13,980
What are we doing here anyway?

1299
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:14,700
We're diving?

1300
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:15,460
Is that it?

1301
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:16,860
Yeah, we're learning how to dive.

1302
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:18,720
Cool.

1303
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:19,900
The Duke of Milan.

1304
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:21,340
Oh.

1305
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:22,420
That's you.

1306
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:23,500
No, that's you.

1307
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:25,520
You're that in the blue shirt.

1308
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:25,960
Oh, you're right.

1309
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:30,640
What a fucking dude.

1310
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:32,180
Look, she's like...

1311
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:33,280
Comforting, man.

1312
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:35,060
She likes it when they're weak.

1313
00:45:45,190 --> 00:45:45,630
Oh.

1314
00:45:45,810 --> 00:45:46,210
Oh.

1315
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:47,850
What about over here?

1316
00:45:48,050 --> 00:45:48,630
What is this?

1317
00:45:48,790 --> 00:45:49,770
That's pretty far out of the way.

1318
00:45:49,770 --> 00:45:50,370
Oh my gosh, going through the picks.

1319
00:45:50,470 --> 00:45:51,630
Can you see me going through the picks?

1320
00:45:51,730 --> 00:45:54,450
No, I'm fucking talking to the captain right now.

1321
00:45:55,390 --> 00:45:56,390
I'm looking at some...

1322
00:45:56,390 --> 00:45:56,450
Oh!

1323
00:45:57,250 --> 00:45:58,270
I found a ship.

1324
00:45:59,190 --> 00:45:59,630
Yeah.

1325
00:46:00,670 --> 00:46:01,530
This is different.

1326
00:46:01,890 --> 00:46:02,330
Dog?

1327
00:46:05,370 --> 00:46:06,250
Come here.

1328
00:46:06,450 --> 00:46:09,450
I think it's hot diggity dog.

1329
00:46:12,350 --> 00:46:13,950
Wait, you did your homework?

1330
00:46:14,570 --> 00:46:15,710
What do you mean?

1331
00:46:16,150 --> 00:46:16,590
Oh.

1332
00:46:17,270 --> 00:46:18,330
Yeah, we got a wreck.

1333
00:46:18,470 --> 00:46:18,930
We got a wreck.

1334
00:46:18,930 --> 00:46:22,230
We have to do some diving that you suggested.

1335
00:46:22,610 --> 00:46:25,530
The captain said it's not a good idea, but I trusted you, Mint.

1336
00:46:25,730 --> 00:46:26,090
The captain said it's not a good idea, but I trusted you, Mint.

1337
00:46:26,090 --> 00:46:27,350
I trusted your call.

1338
00:46:27,870 --> 00:46:28,310
Cool.

1339
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:30,950
If we die, it's on you.

1340
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:37,710
Oh, I'm looking at the pictures now.

1341
00:46:37,970 --> 00:46:38,310
Yeah.

1342
00:46:45,190 --> 00:46:49,090
I don't know, the captain was like, not a good idea.

1343
00:46:56,970 --> 00:46:58,410
Oh, wow!

1344
00:46:59,630 --> 00:47:00,350
Wow!

1345
00:47:01,030 --> 00:47:01,170
Wow!

1346
00:47:04,110 --> 00:47:05,550
Mmmmm, nooooooo!

1347
00:47:07,390 --> 00:47:09,570
I'm gonna be disappointed.

1348
00:47:10,210 --> 00:47:15,310
Oh, why am I Conrad?

1349
00:47:15,630 --> 00:47:17,690
Wait, you're Conrad now?

1350
00:47:20,370 --> 00:47:21,370
Mint?

1351
00:47:24,830 --> 00:47:25,830
Mint,

1352
00:47:33,230 --> 00:47:35,190
what decision did you make?

1353
00:47:35,550 --> 00:47:36,390
Not because she's beautiful.

1354
00:47:36,970 --> 00:47:38,370
I mean, she is beautiful.

1355
00:47:38,710 --> 00:47:40,130
But that's like, a coincidence.

1356
00:47:40,430 --> 00:47:41,170
Oh my god.

1357
00:47:41,270 --> 00:47:41,890
Oh my god.

1358
00:47:42,350 --> 00:47:44,690
Hey, I'm Conrad now, I have to do what I have to do.

1359
00:47:48,630 --> 00:47:49,810
Oh my god.

1360
00:47:50,330 --> 00:47:52,550
I think I'm gonna marry a bitch.

1361
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:55,330
She's like a Karen for real.

1362
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:57,250
Yeah, I think I'm gonna marry a Karen.

1363
00:47:57,710 --> 00:47:59,830
Mint, why did you not say anything?

1364
00:48:00,810 --> 00:48:03,870
Why did you say nothing when I asked you?

1365
00:48:03,910 --> 00:48:05,370
You guys in the water enough to...

1366
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:06,370
I'll set up the tanks.

1367
00:48:06,490 --> 00:48:07,690
The boys will do the final check.

1368
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:08,670
It's not my call!

1369
00:48:08,950 --> 00:48:09,650
Take a look at the camera.

1370
00:48:09,690 --> 00:48:10,470
See if you can find anything.

1371
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:12,430
That one second loading screen there.

1372
00:48:12,510 --> 00:48:13,490
Yeah, what the hell is that?

1373
00:48:13,710 --> 00:48:14,830
Maybe you should check on your bro?

1374
00:48:15,770 --> 00:48:17,530
Yeah, where's my... where's the bro?

1375
00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:18,230
Where's Brad?

1376
00:48:18,910 --> 00:48:19,450
Oh shi- oh.

1377
00:48:19,890 --> 00:48:21,090
Brad, where are you?

1378
00:48:22,570 --> 00:48:24,210
Where are you, Brad?

1379
00:48:24,590 --> 00:48:25,070
Oh my god.

1380
00:48:25,890 --> 00:48:27,750
Oh, look at the binoculars.

1381
00:48:28,130 --> 00:48:29,810
The way you like, walk and glide around.

1382
00:48:29,950 --> 00:48:31,470
The way you like, walk and glide around.

1383
00:48:32,310 --> 00:48:32,750
Oooh.

1384
00:48:34,050 --> 00:48:35,270
I'll find you later.

1385
00:48:35,270 --> 00:48:36,590
I'm looking at the binoculars.

1386
00:48:36,890 --> 00:48:38,690
I'm looking at the pictures again.

1387
00:48:38,890 --> 00:48:39,930
I like the pictures.

1388
00:48:41,730 --> 00:48:43,090
I'm an iPad kid.

1389
00:48:45,030 --> 00:48:46,010
Ooh, that opening.

1390
00:48:46,770 --> 00:48:48,030
Okay, we got it.

1391
00:48:48,170 --> 00:48:48,490
Okay.

1392
00:48:49,310 --> 00:48:51,010
This is like such a tiny ship.

1393
00:48:51,070 --> 00:48:52,150
Where could Brad go?

1394
00:48:52,890 --> 00:48:54,170
I think he's laying down.

1395
00:48:54,250 --> 00:48:54,790
Oh, I'm stuck.

1396
00:48:54,990 --> 00:48:55,770
Oh, wait, where am I?

1397
00:48:55,910 --> 00:48:56,350
Wait.

1398
00:48:57,050 --> 00:48:58,850
Hey, I'm gonna talk to my girlfriend.

1399
00:48:59,630 --> 00:49:00,270
Me too.

1400
00:49:00,570 --> 00:49:01,270
You're a good girl.

1401
00:49:01,930 --> 00:49:02,650
You're like...

1402
00:49:02,650 --> 00:49:05,250
You're vibrating in this moment.

1403
00:49:05,250 --> 00:49:08,490
You need a hand.

1404
00:49:08,810 --> 00:49:10,610
I'm in this conversation too.

1405
00:49:10,810 --> 00:49:11,270
Let me in.

1406
00:49:11,750 --> 00:49:13,150
I think we're in good shape.

1407
00:49:13,370 --> 00:49:15,070
It's probably not a bad idea for you to have a few...

1408
00:49:15,070 --> 00:49:16,430
I'm actually in the conversation.

1409
00:49:16,890 --> 00:49:17,390
Hey, hey, J.J.

1410
00:49:17,890 --> 00:49:18,590
You all right?

1411
00:49:19,130 --> 00:49:19,770
J.J.

1412
00:49:19,950 --> 00:49:19,970
I'm sorry.

1413
00:49:20,110 --> 00:49:23,090
Got to say, not too happy with our captain at the moment.

1414
00:49:23,310 --> 00:49:24,350
She's right there.

1415
00:49:24,430 --> 00:49:25,210
Wait, what?

1416
00:49:25,770 --> 00:49:26,490
Who are you deciding?

1417
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:28,270
I'm gonna be annoyed.

1418
00:49:28,710 --> 00:49:29,750
Oh, you're gonna be white knight her?

1419
00:49:30,190 --> 00:49:35,230
We paid top dollar to come out here in the middle of nowhere to do whatever the hell we want without any namby-pamby to keep her in the dark.

1420
00:49:47,270 --> 00:49:51,010
I know, me too.

1421
00:49:52,110 --> 00:49:54,890
Oh my god!

1422
00:49:55,050 --> 00:49:56,390
He's self-aware!

1423
00:49:57,190 --> 00:49:58,910
He's actually self-aware!

1424
00:49:58,910 --> 00:49:59,930
Why are you vibrating?

1425
00:50:02,070 --> 00:50:03,330
I'm trying to go to Brad!

1426
00:50:03,610 --> 00:50:05,290
I want to talk to him!

1427
00:50:05,410 --> 00:50:06,270
I want to look at the weather!

1428
00:50:06,770 --> 00:50:07,450
I'm going to Brad.

1429
00:50:08,150 --> 00:50:09,910
Oh, I turned it off.

1430
00:50:10,310 --> 00:50:11,430
Wait, I think I see a picture.

1431
00:50:12,870 --> 00:50:15,210
Is this one of those sneaky pictures?

1432
00:50:15,910 --> 00:50:16,550
Well, hello.

1433
00:50:17,510 --> 00:50:18,150
What's this?

1434
00:50:18,470 --> 00:50:20,650
What are you looking at?

1435
00:50:22,270 --> 00:50:23,210
I'm heading over.

1436
00:50:24,110 --> 00:50:25,790
I unlocked a premonition.

1437
00:50:26,310 --> 00:50:28,410
Oh, that's going to help me out with decisions, remember?

1438
00:50:28,930 --> 00:50:29,370
Yeah!

1439
00:50:29,930 --> 00:50:31,910
I want to see so I know that you won't fuck up.

1440
00:50:34,390 --> 00:50:35,910
He's going to be in here.

1441
00:50:36,670 --> 00:50:37,810
What's this premonition?

1442
00:50:38,470 --> 00:50:39,390
Wait, that's Brad.

1443
00:50:40,050 --> 00:50:41,290
Yeah, I don't...

1444
00:50:41,790 --> 00:50:42,950
It doesn't do anything.

1445
00:50:43,190 --> 00:50:43,710
What does that mean?

1446
00:50:44,230 --> 00:50:46,670
What does that mean?

1447
00:50:48,250 --> 00:50:49,550
I'm trying to make a decision!

1448
00:50:51,730 --> 00:50:54,350
I'm trying to look at a premonition right now!

1449
00:50:55,350 --> 00:50:56,590
I'm making a decision!

1450
00:50:58,050 --> 00:50:58,370
Okay.

1451
00:50:58,670 --> 00:50:59,910
Brad's in the bathroom.

1452
00:50:59,930 --> 00:51:02,290
I'm going to be a dick to him.

1453
00:51:02,550 --> 00:51:04,050
You're going to be a dick to my bro?

1454
00:51:04,210 --> 00:51:05,610
You're going to be a dick to yourself?

1455
00:51:06,050 --> 00:51:07,770
I hate myself.

1456
00:51:08,710 --> 00:51:09,230
.

1457
00:51:09,230 --> 00:51:10,010
.

1458
00:51:17,330 --> 00:51:18,970
Why did he do that?

1459
00:51:21,270 --> 00:51:21,930
What's this?

1460
00:51:22,230 --> 00:51:22,930
Oh, there's cologne.

1461
00:51:24,050 --> 00:51:25,030
Captain Kiss?

1462
00:51:25,410 --> 00:51:27,670
I'm looking at cologne while you're bullying yourself.

1463
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:30,650
Where are you?

1464
00:51:31,570 --> 00:51:32,430
Are you in the bathroom?

1465
00:51:32,850 --> 00:51:33,870
I was opening the closet.

1466
00:51:34,970 --> 00:51:36,210
There's another room here.

1467
00:51:36,990 --> 00:51:37,870
Oh, I'm going in.

1468
00:51:37,890 --> 00:51:39,810
Yeah, now I'll talk to my little bro.

1469
00:51:40,370 --> 00:51:40,730
What's up?

1470
00:51:41,570 --> 00:51:42,450
How you doing?

1471
00:51:43,650 --> 00:51:45,990
Sorry, that brewski got the better of me.

1472
00:51:46,110 --> 00:51:46,450
Hello, locker.

1473
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:49,310
Oh, I'm going through people's things.

1474
00:51:49,530 --> 00:51:50,550
That's really normal.

1475
00:51:50,970 --> 00:51:52,090
All part of the adventure.

1476
00:51:52,550 --> 00:51:53,690
Oh, I'm looking at the cologne too.

1477
00:51:53,690 --> 00:51:55,010
Sorry for putting a damper on things.

1478
00:51:55,130 --> 00:51:55,730
No worries, dude.

1479
00:51:56,150 --> 00:51:57,850
Do more than that just to script the trip.

1480
00:51:58,810 --> 00:52:00,590
Why am I going through your stuff?

1481
00:52:01,370 --> 00:52:02,130
What the hell?

1482
00:52:02,470 --> 00:52:06,370
Look, I comfort my bro after you bullied him.

1483
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:08,470
Why are you looking at my stuff?

1484
00:52:09,090 --> 00:52:10,630
Hey, hey, hey, I was just snooping.

1485
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:11,650
What are you doing?

1486
00:52:11,870 --> 00:52:13,910
All this stuff was up to code.

1487
00:52:14,410 --> 00:52:15,770
I'm just being normal.

1488
00:52:15,770 --> 00:52:17,410
Yeah, you were looking at my cologne.

1489
00:52:17,550 --> 00:52:19,370
I saw you looking at my cologne.

1490
00:52:19,570 --> 00:52:21,130
I took your cologne, actually.

1491
00:52:21,230 --> 00:52:22,750
Wait, you took my cologne?

1492
00:52:24,330 --> 00:52:25,330
Oh, this...

1493
00:52:25,330 --> 00:52:25,850
Yeah.

1494
00:52:26,130 --> 00:52:27,370
I think we talked to our bro.

1495
00:52:27,510 --> 00:52:28,350
Now what do we do?

1496
00:52:28,510 --> 00:52:30,270
I'm gonna go talk to the captain now.

1497
00:52:30,350 --> 00:52:32,830
I'm gonna watch you talk to the captain.

1498
00:52:33,410 --> 00:52:34,750
I'm gonna watch you fail.

1499
00:52:34,950 --> 00:52:35,510
Yeah.

1500
00:52:37,190 --> 00:52:38,310
Hey, girl.

1501
00:52:39,710 --> 00:52:40,270
Really?

1502
00:52:41,350 --> 00:52:42,830
Get out of my cutscene.

1503
00:52:45,830 --> 00:52:46,390
Really?

1504
00:52:48,050 --> 00:52:48,610
Really?

1505
00:52:48,610 --> 00:52:49,070
Really?

1506
00:52:49,070 --> 00:52:49,330
Really?

1507
00:52:52,870 --> 00:52:53,430
Really?

1508
00:52:53,690 --> 00:52:55,530
Oh, captain by captain?

1509
00:52:55,870 --> 00:52:56,870
I like it when you're strong.

1510
00:52:58,450 --> 00:53:00,150
Sometimes I just wanna be kept in line.

1511
00:53:00,210 --> 00:53:00,610
You know what I'm saying?

1512
00:53:00,970 --> 00:53:02,530
I don't mind a little submission now.

1513
00:53:02,670 --> 00:53:03,870
Oh my god.

1514
00:53:04,810 --> 00:53:05,590
Turn one off.

1515
00:53:05,790 --> 00:53:08,750
That thing where you have to hit on me like every two seconds.

1516
00:53:08,910 --> 00:53:09,830
I think she likes it.

1517
00:53:12,250 --> 00:53:12,650
Bro.

1518
00:53:13,970 --> 00:53:14,970
So, is it working?

1519
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:15,950
Where are you?

1520
00:53:15,950 --> 00:53:16,950
Come back to my cutscene.

1521
00:53:17,510 --> 00:53:18,290
Where are you?

1522
00:53:20,710 --> 00:53:23,370
These rules are all pretty basic stuff.

1523
00:53:23,370 --> 00:53:26,770
How much experience do you have with these kind of dives?

1524
00:53:28,650 --> 00:53:31,050
Are you still talking to me?

1525
00:53:31,350 --> 00:53:31,830
Yeah.

1526
00:53:32,790 --> 00:53:34,930
Pretty much an authority back home.

1527
00:53:35,130 --> 00:53:35,510
Oh yeah.

1528
00:53:35,630 --> 00:53:37,190
If you move around does he move?

1529
00:53:37,310 --> 00:53:39,110
Why don't you wanna follow the rules for unreported wrecks?

1530
00:53:40,510 --> 00:53:42,890
But all you know this could be a war.

1531
00:53:43,510 --> 00:53:44,910
Did you see me?

1532
00:53:45,770 --> 00:53:46,310
Yes.

1533
00:53:50,850 --> 00:53:52,110
I'm gonna be playful.

1534
00:53:52,170 --> 00:53:53,350
Bro, you're still talking to me.

1535
00:53:53,370 --> 00:53:53,990
I'm talking to her.

1536
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:56,670
Holy shit.

1537
00:53:57,070 --> 00:53:58,610
You've never spoken to a woman before.

1538
00:53:58,690 --> 00:54:01,870
You've only talked to your sister.

1539
00:54:04,250 --> 00:54:04,810
Damn.

1540
00:54:06,110 --> 00:54:08,650
It's my turn to talk to her now.

1541
00:54:08,830 --> 00:54:09,870
Alright, you talk to her.

1542
00:54:09,910 --> 00:54:10,410
You talk to her.

1543
00:54:11,530 --> 00:54:12,330
I'm watching.

1544
00:54:12,590 --> 00:54:12,990
I'm watching.

1545
00:54:13,310 --> 00:54:14,170
Are you talking to her?

1546
00:54:14,290 --> 00:54:14,990
No, I'm stuck.

1547
00:54:15,370 --> 00:54:17,250
Wait, the conversation.

1548
00:54:17,710 --> 00:54:18,670
Wait, I'm stuck.

1549
00:54:19,110 --> 00:54:22,270
Wait, I went inside.

1550
00:54:23,370 --> 00:54:23,770
Oh no.

1551
00:54:24,170 --> 00:54:26,190
I can't progress anything.

1552
00:54:27,310 --> 00:54:27,950
No.

1553
00:54:28,270 --> 00:54:31,130
Did you see me just looking around?

1554
00:54:31,570 --> 00:54:34,190
What's going on?

1555
00:54:34,490 --> 00:54:34,950
What's going on?

1556
00:54:34,950 --> 00:54:35,510
What's going on?

1557
00:54:38,310 --> 00:54:38,950
No.

1558
00:54:39,670 --> 00:54:41,250
We broke the game.

1559
00:54:43,370 --> 00:54:44,110
Fix it.

1560
00:54:44,290 --> 00:54:45,410
Fix it.

1561
00:54:45,630 --> 00:54:46,970
Talk to our sister.

1562
00:54:47,190 --> 00:54:47,750
Wait, wait, wait.

1563
00:54:47,750 --> 00:54:48,030
There you go.

1564
00:54:48,030 --> 00:54:49,710
No, I can't move.

1565
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:51,730
I'm just stuck here.

1566
00:54:51,730 --> 00:54:51,970
Yeah.

1567
00:54:53,370 --> 00:54:54,070
I'm gonna go look at it.

1568
00:54:54,090 --> 00:54:55,950
Start the next scene, Min.

1569
00:54:56,030 --> 00:54:57,210
Start the next scene.

1570
00:54:58,290 --> 00:54:59,510
She said something.

1571
00:55:00,450 --> 00:55:01,310
What's going on?

1572
00:55:02,010 --> 00:55:03,870
I'm looking at her driver's license.

1573
00:55:04,210 --> 00:55:05,290
I'm such a freak.

1574
00:55:06,230 --> 00:55:07,910
How do we start the next scene?

1575
00:55:09,490 --> 00:55:10,210
Hold on.

1576
00:55:12,450 --> 00:55:14,170
I just doubted her credentials.

1577
00:55:14,710 --> 00:55:16,070
Wait, she's your sister.

1578
00:55:16,210 --> 00:55:17,670
What do you mean you doubted her credentials?

1579
00:55:18,510 --> 00:55:19,530
No, no, no.

1580
00:55:19,530 --> 00:55:20,130
Oh my god.

1581
00:55:20,190 --> 00:55:21,830
You're still standing there.

1582
00:55:23,450 --> 00:55:26,190
How do we start the game?

1583
00:55:26,830 --> 00:55:27,390
How do we start the game?

1584
00:55:28,390 --> 00:55:29,350
I can't.

1585
00:55:29,590 --> 00:55:31,250
I'm gonna push you.

1586
00:55:31,310 --> 00:55:33,010
Push me into the boat.

1587
00:55:33,230 --> 00:55:34,450
Push me into the boat.

1588
00:55:34,750 --> 00:55:35,750
I can't push you.

1589
00:55:36,350 --> 00:55:38,390
I'm gonna go talk to my sister.

1590
00:55:39,530 --> 00:55:40,450
Oh my god.

1591
00:55:41,790 --> 00:55:43,030
Oh my god.

1592
00:55:43,050 --> 00:55:44,170
We fixed it.

1593
00:55:45,970 --> 00:55:47,310
Oh my god.

1594
00:55:47,310 --> 00:55:47,450
Perfect!

1595
00:55:51,970 --> 00:55:56,570
It gets totally reused.

1596
00:55:56,750 --> 00:55:57,070
Okay.

1597
00:55:59,530 --> 00:56:00,850
Oh yeah, yeah.

1598
00:56:00,890 --> 00:56:01,490
We have to do...

1599
00:56:01,490 --> 00:56:03,170
We won't die here.

1600
00:56:06,450 --> 00:56:08,150
I don't think I'm diving.

1601
00:56:08,890 --> 00:56:10,790
Are you gonna be my girlfriend now?

1602
00:56:11,050 --> 00:56:12,270
You gotta check your O2 first.

1603
00:56:12,870 --> 00:56:13,550
Oh, maybe.

1604
00:56:14,130 --> 00:56:14,870
Oh, okay.

1605
00:56:15,450 --> 00:56:16,390
Thanks for your playful.

1606
00:56:17,310 --> 00:56:18,230
I'm gonna be playful.

1607
00:56:22,370 --> 00:56:24,010
Bro, you were...

1608
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:24,970
What the hell?

1609
00:56:24,970 --> 00:56:27,210
You were like creeping on the captain earlier.

1610
00:56:27,930 --> 00:56:29,510
I bought this drone.

1611
00:56:29,570 --> 00:56:30,250
This is the line.

1612
00:56:33,430 --> 00:56:34,130
Kabooey?

1613
00:56:38,610 --> 00:56:44,130
Oh my god, we are alone!

1614
00:56:44,690 --> 00:56:47,050
Right after defending you, Sissy!

1615
00:56:47,190 --> 00:56:49,910
You're like, anyway, I'm gonna hit him up with the captain again.

1616
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:54,590
Wait, what's the baton stick?

1617
00:56:54,670 --> 00:56:55,350
Or the camera?

1618
00:56:55,550 --> 00:56:56,670
We don't need a camera.

1619
00:56:56,730 --> 00:56:57,830
We're gonna need that baton.

1620
00:56:59,990 --> 00:57:01,170
I don't know what this is.

1621
00:57:02,850 --> 00:57:03,730
A bang stick?

1622
00:57:11,750 --> 00:57:13,730
Take the camera or Julia?

1623
00:57:14,890 --> 00:57:18,350
Why is the lighting really dark all of a sudden?

1624
00:57:18,510 --> 00:57:20,490
I can't even know what's happening!

1625
00:57:20,990 --> 00:57:24,970
Why is the lighting so dark?

1626
00:57:31,950 --> 00:57:33,290
Oh, it's fixed.

1627
00:57:33,550 --> 00:57:33,950
It's fixed.

1628
00:57:36,860 --> 00:57:37,750
Oh my god.

1629
00:57:39,530 --> 00:57:40,430
What's happening?

1630
00:57:40,690 --> 00:57:41,150
I don't know.

1631
00:57:41,230 --> 00:57:42,930
Why is she just looking at us like that?

1632
00:57:44,130 --> 00:57:44,650
She's nervous.

1633
00:57:45,450 --> 00:57:46,910
I got a bang stick.

1634
00:57:47,490 --> 00:57:49,570
I got a stick that bangs.

1635
00:57:55,550 --> 00:57:57,390
Julia liked it last night.

1636
00:58:01,010 --> 00:58:04,970
Wait, so am I doing nothing?

1637
00:58:05,230 --> 00:58:05,530
Nice.

1638
00:58:06,330 --> 00:58:08,190
Alright, it's up to you, Dokie.

1639
00:58:08,250 --> 00:58:09,230
Wait a minute.

1640
00:58:09,770 --> 00:58:13,030
You were Brad, now Conrad, and now Julia?

1641
00:58:13,030 --> 00:58:14,290
Like, pick a lane.

1642
00:58:14,690 --> 00:58:15,250
There's no way.

1643
00:58:15,590 --> 00:58:16,170
There's no way.

1644
00:58:16,610 --> 00:58:18,010
Oh my god.

1645
00:58:18,010 --> 00:58:18,730
There's dead bodies in here.

1646
00:58:18,730 --> 00:58:19,690
Wait, there's dead bodies in here.

1647
00:58:20,010 --> 00:58:20,930
Is this Madon?

1648
00:58:21,750 --> 00:58:23,230
No, this is a plane.

1649
00:58:25,650 --> 00:58:26,570
It's a plane?

1650
00:58:27,190 --> 00:58:27,630
Yeah.

1651
00:58:27,690 --> 00:58:28,710
Why are we going in here?

1652
00:58:29,370 --> 00:58:30,870
Because we found this wreck.

1653
00:58:34,030 --> 00:58:34,790
Here we go.

1654
00:58:35,590 --> 00:58:36,370
Down we go.

1655
00:58:36,470 --> 00:58:38,730
Why are we diving when it's the sun setting?

1656
00:58:38,850 --> 00:58:39,710
Should we just wait for day?

1657
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:40,850
Howdy, Captain.

1658
00:58:41,650 --> 00:58:42,730
You fancy climbing?

1659
00:58:42,730 --> 00:58:43,850
Are you still talking to her?

1660
00:58:44,350 --> 00:58:46,210
No, I'm watching the cutscene.

1661
00:58:48,170 --> 00:58:49,210
Uh oh.

1662
00:58:49,910 --> 00:58:51,510
You're gonna need to use your bang stick.

1663
00:58:56,270 --> 00:58:58,530
The boat looks really far away.

1664
00:58:58,730 --> 00:59:00,670
Wait, I'm gonna be fli- Okay.

1665
00:59:01,490 --> 00:59:02,790
Alright, you know what?

1666
00:59:03,250 --> 00:59:03,770
Sure.

1667
00:59:04,110 --> 00:59:05,090
I'll give you one.

1668
00:59:05,670 --> 00:59:06,890
Wait, are you on the boat?

1669
00:59:07,150 --> 00:59:08,090
Yeah, I'm Fliss.

1670
00:59:08,450 --> 00:59:09,210
I'm underwater.

1671
00:59:10,850 --> 00:59:12,350
You're hanging to be underwater.

1672
00:59:12,350 --> 00:59:12,870
No way!

1673
00:59:15,450 --> 00:59:16,250
No way!

1674
00:59:17,630 --> 00:59:18,110
You're the Karen.

1675
00:59:18,110 --> 00:59:20,430
We know why somebody died.

1676
00:59:23,550 --> 00:59:24,830
It's a long story.

1677
00:59:25,090 --> 00:59:25,950
Oh my god.

1678
00:59:25,950 --> 00:59:27,650
It's complicated and it's really difficult to explain.

1679
00:59:27,710 --> 00:59:28,290
Well, I'm a complicated guy.

1680
00:59:28,290 --> 00:59:29,230
Doki Bird is Fliss.

1681
00:59:29,310 --> 00:59:30,030
Why am I?

1682
00:59:30,050 --> 00:59:31,130
Why am I Julia?

1683
00:59:31,570 --> 00:59:33,190
All of a sudden- You're the Karen.

1684
00:59:35,510 --> 00:59:36,810
Oh my god.

1685
00:59:37,150 --> 00:59:38,270
You know you're smarter than you look.

1686
00:59:38,430 --> 00:59:39,490
If you're interested.

1687
00:59:39,570 --> 00:59:40,030
Here I go.

1688
00:59:40,170 --> 00:59:41,190
I'm going inside the ship.

1689
00:59:42,110 --> 00:59:42,970
Oh my god.

1690
00:59:43,050 --> 00:59:45,890
Comrade's like- Comrade wants to invest in my business.

1691
00:59:46,410 --> 00:59:46,850
What?

1692
00:59:47,450 --> 00:59:48,110
Oh, okay.

1693
00:59:48,390 --> 00:59:49,150
Oh, oh, oh.

1694
00:59:49,150 --> 00:59:50,210
I want Conrad's money.

1695
00:59:50,790 --> 00:59:53,290
Oh, I almost just killed Julia, I think.

1696
00:59:53,550 --> 00:59:55,070
I suppose you could have that conversation.

1697
00:59:55,650 --> 00:59:57,510
Oh my god.

1698
00:59:57,550 --> 00:59:57,990
That scared me.

1699
00:59:58,190 --> 00:59:58,830
Oh my god.

1700
00:59:58,870 --> 01:00:00,370
I just noticed something was wrong.

1701
01:00:00,630 --> 01:00:00,750
You know what?

1702
01:00:00,950 --> 01:00:03,630
I better spend some time keeping the Duke of Milan ship-shaped.

1703
01:00:03,650 --> 01:00:05,510
Explore the- the plane wreck.

1704
01:00:08,740 --> 01:00:09,180
Bye bye.

1705
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:10,480
Let's see.

1706
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:12,680
Wait for the others to return from the dive.

1707
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:15,540
Oh, you are doing- Why are you doing the action?

1708
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:17,140
I don't know!

1709
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:20,180
Why am I doing the action part?

1710
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:21,480
I'm just chilling.

1711
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:24,300
I'm just chilling on the ship right now.

1712
01:00:24,300 --> 01:00:25,100
Why are we both- Oh, wait.

1713
01:00:25,180 --> 01:00:25,480
What was that?

1714
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:25,800
What was that?

1715
01:00:25,820 --> 01:00:26,040
What was that?

1716
01:00:26,100 --> 01:00:26,820
Oh, I can talk to you.

1717
01:00:27,460 --> 01:00:27,940
You can?

1718
01:00:28,180 --> 01:00:28,540
Yeah.

1719
01:00:29,380 --> 01:00:29,740
Hello.

1720
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:30,960
Duke to Alex.

1721
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:32,300
Duke to Julia.

1722
01:00:32,620 --> 01:00:34,360
I didn't hear- Do you guys hear me?

1723
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:35,200
Oh, I heard it.

1724
01:00:35,220 --> 01:00:35,640
I heard it.

1725
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:37,300
We're looking at a hole.

1726
01:00:37,820 --> 01:00:38,900
Don't- ignore her.

1727
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:39,560
Ignore Fliss.

1728
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:42,340
You're gonna ignore me?

1729
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:46,160
She's angry.

1730
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:47,240
I'm gonna call you guys again.

1731
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:51,480
I'm gonna- You think you can- I'm not even- You think you can just ignore me like that?

1732
01:00:52,460 --> 01:00:53,220
Duke to Alex.

1733
01:00:53,220 --> 01:00:54,080
Ring, ring, ring.

1734
01:00:54,580 --> 01:00:54,760
Duke to Julia.

1735
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:01,040
Oh, you're gonna ghost me now?

1736
01:01:02,220 --> 01:01:04,140
Yeah, I'm doing risky business, okay?

1737
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:08,580
Don't be such a gonad, doge god.

1738
01:01:09,460 --> 01:01:11,720
You think I'm not gonna spam call you now?

1739
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:16,360
Don't you- Oh my god.

1740
01:01:16,460 --> 01:01:17,580
I think she might die.

1741
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:18,980
Don't worry.

1742
01:01:19,180 --> 01:01:19,420
Don't worry.

1743
01:01:19,460 --> 01:01:20,320
I'm calling you guys again.

1744
01:01:20,420 --> 01:01:21,160
Don't- Alex.

1745
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:22,300
Duke to Julia.

1746
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:24,120
Oh, there's an octopus in here!

1747
01:01:30,300 --> 01:01:31,460
Don't be such a gonad.

1748
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,980
Okay, if you guys die, it's not on me.

1749
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:36,720
You guys die.

1750
01:01:37,660 --> 01:01:38,460
I got it.

1751
01:01:38,540 --> 01:01:39,020
I got it.

1752
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:39,900
Okay, let's see.

1753
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:40,240
What's this?

1754
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:42,220
Oh, those are the photos.

1755
01:01:43,060 --> 01:01:43,540
Uh oh.

1756
01:01:43,620 --> 01:01:44,140
I'm lost.

1757
01:01:44,140 --> 01:01:46,160
Oh, he's here.

1758
01:01:47,180 --> 01:01:48,340
You're a good boyfriend.

1759
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:49,700
He gave me oxygen.

1760
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:50,880
Oh, nice.

1761
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:53,160
Now you're gonna kill fucking Alex.

1762
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:57,380
You're gonna kill Alex.

1763
01:01:57,480 --> 01:02:03,920
I spent so much- I spent a lot of difficult decisions to get Alex to where he's at and now you're just gonna kill him off.

1764
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:05,400
I don't know what I'm doing.

1765
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:09,600
She is so rude.

1766
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:11,180
I told you.

1767
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:12,240
She's such a Karen.

1768
01:02:12,380 --> 01:02:13,780
I hope she dies.

1769
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:15,760
This- this- oh.

1770
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:17,120
You found a secret.

1771
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:18,120
Yeah.

1772
01:02:19,060 --> 01:02:20,560
Yeah, because I did risky business.

1773
01:02:20,660 --> 01:02:21,100
I told you.

1774
01:02:21,180 --> 01:02:22,040
Oh, I'm lagging.

1775
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:22,500
Oh my god.

1776
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:23,020
What's happening?

1777
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:23,320
Okay.

1778
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:27,540
Go easy on the booze.

1779
01:02:27,540 --> 01:02:30,740
I'm gonna- I'm bullying Brad right now.

1780
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:31,760
See?

1781
01:02:31,900 --> 01:02:33,100
It's easy to bully him.

1782
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:38,620
Well, let's avoid that tube.

1783
01:02:39,220 --> 01:02:40,500
What do you know, Brad?

1784
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:42,140
What do you know, Brad?

1785
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:42,860
He doesn't know anything.

1786
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:43,360
It's Brad.

1787
01:02:43,780 --> 01:02:43,920
He's got a lot of bad theories.

1788
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:47,620
I got tired of the speculation and wanted to see if there was actually anything there.

1789
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:49,760
Okay.

1790
01:02:49,860 --> 01:02:52,140
Oh, the ship is around World War II.

1791
01:02:53,860 --> 01:02:54,660
Yeah, right?

1792
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:55,600
Cause, uh...

1793
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:57,380
How did you figure it out?

1794
01:02:57,640 --> 01:02:59,660
Everyone was just looking at where the plane was headed.

1795
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,400
But, I asked myself, where is the plane from?

1796
01:03:02,860 --> 01:03:03,900
I'm using my bang stick.

1797
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:04,860
I'm using my bang stick.

1798
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:05,600
What am I banging?

1799
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:08,100
You're welcome.

1800
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:09,800
I got you that bang stick.

1801
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:10,980
I did it.

1802
01:03:11,020 --> 01:03:11,860
I used it.

1803
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:12,300
I used it.

1804
01:03:13,140 --> 01:03:14,420
Did she like it?

1805
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:16,500
Oh my god!

1806
01:03:16,780 --> 01:03:17,980
It's a dead man.

1807
01:03:21,260 --> 01:03:21,980
She's banging?

1808
01:03:22,220 --> 01:03:22,720
She's banging?

1809
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:23,620
I'm banging.

1810
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:24,160
I'm banging.

1811
01:03:24,740 --> 01:03:27,280
I'm investigating the ghost.

1812
01:03:28,040 --> 01:03:28,580
What?

1813
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:30,400
What happened?

1814
01:03:31,420 --> 01:03:32,260
What the fuck?

1815
01:03:32,340 --> 01:03:34,460
An eel attacked me!

1816
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:37,580
All I get is the ship with fucking Conrad.

1817
01:03:37,720 --> 01:03:39,400
You get to explore.

1818
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:42,520
I had to deal with fucking Conrad.

1819
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:46,780
Is that fair?

1820
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:49,240
I'm just saying.

1821
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:52,000
Maybe you should have picked Brad instead.

1822
01:03:53,780 --> 01:03:54,740
There's another guy.

1823
01:03:55,300 --> 01:03:57,500
Wait, let me investigate him, please.

1824
01:03:57,960 --> 01:03:58,600
Investigate.

1825
01:03:58,660 --> 01:03:59,640
I'm trying to turn around.

1826
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:00,860
So, are you beached?

1827
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:06,100
I'm piloting the plane?

1828
01:04:07,660 --> 01:04:09,320
Oh my god.

1829
01:04:10,340 --> 01:04:11,320
Oh my god.

1830
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:13,460
Should I hit on Conrad?

1831
01:04:14,220 --> 01:04:14,660
Yeah!

1832
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:15,720
Do I do it?

1833
01:04:15,780 --> 01:04:16,440
I'm gonna hit on Conrad.

1834
01:04:16,780 --> 01:04:17,240
Do it.

1835
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:17,560
Do it.

1836
01:04:17,620 --> 01:04:17,860
Do it.

1837
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:19,880
Oh my god.

1838
01:04:20,100 --> 01:04:23,720
Conrad said he'll invest in my business.

1839
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:25,740
Oh my god.

1840
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:27,020
You're in.

1841
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:27,420
You're in.

1842
01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:28,100
I'm in.

1843
01:04:28,700 --> 01:04:29,520
Oh my god.

1844
01:04:29,560 --> 01:04:31,160
My business is gonna flourish now.

1845
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:36,740
I like how the girl was just like, it's not like we're gonna ruin the ship or anything.

1846
01:04:36,740 --> 01:04:38,700
And here I go, like ruining the ship.

1847
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:39,180
Yeah.

1848
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:42,580
I like how I'm also being your wingman right now.

1849
01:04:44,900 --> 01:04:46,320
Oh, he's holding something.

1850
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:47,880
His wife and kids.

1851
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:48,460
Oh my god.

1852
01:04:49,540 --> 01:04:50,140
He's in.

1853
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:52,840
How do I turn this on?

1854
01:04:53,180 --> 01:04:54,240
Weather looks clear.

1855
01:04:55,780 --> 01:04:59,420
Am I just waiting on you guys to return to the ship?

1856
01:04:59,540 --> 01:05:00,700
Like what am I doing here?

1857
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:01,060
I think so.

1858
01:05:01,060 --> 01:05:01,520
I think so.

1859
01:05:01,940 --> 01:05:03,560
I'm just literally waiting.

1860
01:05:04,020 --> 01:05:05,200
Guys, hurry up!

1861
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:11,140
Didn't what's his name say that like wrecking, like diving was his thing?

1862
01:05:11,620 --> 01:05:13,020
Oh there's pirates!

1863
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:13,940
What?

1864
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:16,520
Uh oh, what do you mean there's pirates?

1865
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,140
Like yo ho.

1866
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:19,520
That's not the coast guard.

1867
01:05:19,900 --> 01:05:20,480
That's not the coast guard.

1868
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:20,940
Uh oh.

1869
01:05:21,020 --> 01:05:21,820
Wait, what do you mean?

1870
01:05:22,060 --> 01:05:22,660
So we're not under arrest.

1871
01:05:22,940 --> 01:05:25,380
Mint, I think... I'm stuck.

1872
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:26,420
I think...

1873
01:05:27,020 --> 01:05:28,060
Do I need to come back?

1874
01:05:28,180 --> 01:05:28,820
You should call me back.

1875
01:05:29,220 --> 01:05:29,700
I think there's pirates.

1876
01:05:29,860 --> 01:05:32,240
You should call and say like hey.

1877
01:05:32,380 --> 01:05:34,240
You should call and say like hey.

1878
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:35,080
Get up here.

1879
01:05:35,080 --> 01:05:35,400
You got that?

1880
01:05:35,660 --> 01:05:36,500
Oh no.

1881
01:05:36,940 --> 01:05:38,240
Oh, oh what's going on?

1882
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:39,300
There's pirates.

1883
01:05:40,060 --> 01:05:41,080
I fucked up.

1884
01:05:41,460 --> 01:05:42,920
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah!

1885
01:05:43,380 --> 01:05:44,400
They're moving the ship!

1886
01:05:44,460 --> 01:05:45,720
They're moving the plane!

1887
01:05:48,540 --> 01:05:50,140
Oh my god they're destroying it!

1888
01:05:50,380 --> 01:05:50,820
Wait, what?

1889
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:54,160
They're destroying the plane.

1890
01:05:56,340 --> 01:05:56,960
Grab that.

1891
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:57,460
Who's they?

1892
01:05:57,460 --> 01:05:58,180
Oh my god there's a shark!

1893
01:05:59,000 --> 01:05:59,600
Who's they?

1894
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:01,360
I don't know.

1895
01:06:01,460 --> 01:06:01,880
Something...

1896
01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:03,060
We got damage here, you see this?

1897
01:06:03,060 --> 01:06:04,500
Something pulled him.

1898
01:06:04,860 --> 01:06:05,980
Come at me shark!

1899
01:06:07,180 --> 01:06:08,400
What do you think?

1900
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:09,220
Like, uh...

1901
01:06:09,220 --> 01:06:10,260
10 bucks cover it?

1902
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:14,420
Wow, you guys are doctor and also a marine biologist.

1903
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:15,200
How does he know everything?

1904
01:06:15,980 --> 01:06:16,620
Okay, Mint.

1905
01:06:16,940 --> 01:06:17,860
We're coming back.

1906
01:06:18,260 --> 01:06:21,420
Um, comrade's a bitch.

1907
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:27,200
He's antagonizing the pirates.

1908
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:28,920
Mint, he's just like...

1909
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:29,060
What?

1910
01:06:29,420 --> 01:06:29,900
What?

1911
01:06:31,140 --> 01:06:31,760
Let's go.

1912
01:06:33,060 --> 01:06:35,560
I think Alex is trying to propose under here.

1913
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:37,260
In the...

1914
01:06:37,260 --> 01:06:38,800
In the water!

1915
01:06:39,020 --> 01:06:40,060
He's trying to propose!

1916
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:43,080
Um...

1917
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:43,960
Oh my god.

1918
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:46,360
I don't know what to say.

1919
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:47,820
I'm just gonna say nothing.

1920
01:06:48,980 --> 01:06:49,940
What's going on?

1921
01:06:50,700 --> 01:06:53,000
You got a funny way of saying thank you, Conrad.

1922
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:53,520
Oh, he gave up.

1923
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:53,920
Okay.

1924
01:06:55,580 --> 01:06:56,460
Um, seriously?

1925
01:06:56,740 --> 01:06:57,480
What's going on?

1926
01:06:57,560 --> 01:06:58,600
What's going on, Alex?

1927
01:06:59,020 --> 01:07:00,400
What is going on, dad?

1928
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:01,840
There are so many things going on.

1929
01:07:02,340 --> 01:07:03,000
I know.

1930
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:06,760
When you think of something, I'll just be over here, taking the view...

1931
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:09,180
My relationship with Alex is going down.

1932
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:12,540
My relationship with Conrad is also going down.

1933
01:07:15,720 --> 01:07:18,780
It's nice to know we're both sabotaging each other's relationships.

1934
01:07:19,660 --> 01:07:20,340
I know.

1935
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:23,200
It's fine.

1936
01:07:23,220 --> 01:07:24,200
I can make it up.

1937
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:25,260
I make it up in tenfold.

1938
01:07:25,660 --> 01:07:28,540
Whatever you say to her doesn't mean anything.

1939
01:07:31,020 --> 01:07:33,640
Oh my god, Conrad's fucking... Oh!

1940
01:07:35,080 --> 01:07:36,280
Conrad's barbecuing.

1941
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:38,340
And he's fucked up.

1942
01:07:39,420 --> 01:07:40,460
I'm more like you.

1943
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:42,240
What do you mean?

1944
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:43,500
I'm controlling the captain!

1945
01:07:44,660 --> 01:07:46,340
I didn't even get to make a choice.

1946
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:48,120
I'm going.

1947
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:48,700
I'm going.

1948
01:07:48,820 --> 01:07:49,160
I'm going.

1949
01:07:52,120 --> 01:07:53,680
He's like, we gotta decompress.

1950
01:07:54,980 --> 01:07:55,760
She's heroic.

1951
01:07:57,620 --> 01:08:00,540
Oh, and Alex is just chilling in the water.

1952
01:08:03,560 --> 01:08:05,280
Wait, I'm stuck on... okay.

1953
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:09,640
Alright, Conrad, it's going down.

1954
01:08:09,700 --> 01:08:13,660
Guys, I'm messing up Conrad after all the hard work I did flirting.

1955
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:16,260
Hey, JJ, don't worry about it.

1956
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:20,460
What's going on?

1957
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:22,460
Why did they go at sunset?

1958
01:08:22,460 --> 01:08:24,060
You see that money in the...

1959
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:25,200
Yeah, what's that?

1960
01:08:25,240 --> 01:08:25,740
What's that money?

1961
01:08:26,220 --> 01:08:28,700
It was a little, uh, mishap.

1962
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:30,400
With the barbecue.

1963
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:32,020
I'm all true-stick now.

1964
01:08:32,300 --> 01:08:33,340
The whole boat was lit up.

1965
01:08:34,260 --> 01:08:35,340
Yeah, for real.

1966
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:36,980
It was Conrad's fault.

1967
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,240
So, why are you paying the ocean?

1968
01:08:41,980 --> 01:08:44,200
Yeah, why are you paying the ocean?

1969
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:48,420
A fishing boat came by and got damaged on the dive line.

1970
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:49,680
Oh, that's what happened.

1971
01:08:49,940 --> 01:08:54,060
They were being a little surly about it, so Conrad made it rain and they pissed off.

1972
01:08:54,060 --> 01:08:54,840
Wow.

1973
01:08:55,100 --> 01:08:55,220
Whatever.

1974
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:56,720
They didn't even take the money.

1975
01:08:56,900 --> 01:08:59,140
What I wanna know is what you guys find.

1976
01:08:59,220 --> 01:08:59,800
Yeah, what did you find?

1977
01:09:00,140 --> 01:09:00,860
We found the plane.

1978
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:02,100
And it is huge.

1979
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:03,660
Full of cool stuff.

1980
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:05,600
Yeah, like eels and sharks apparently.

1981
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:06,540
Yeah.

1982
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:07,840
What?

1983
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:09,440
Why?

1984
01:09:09,660 --> 01:09:10,860
The dive line, actually.

1985
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:12,300
Yeah, the dive line.

1986
01:09:12,660 --> 01:09:13,140
How bad?

1987
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:16,780
Uh, there's no cockpit anymore for starters.

1988
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,520
Well, that's just fucking perfect.

1989
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:20,340
Well, that's not our fault.

1990
01:09:20,540 --> 01:09:21,760
Like, we didn't do that.

1991
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:23,600
You're the captain of the ship.

1992
01:09:24,180 --> 01:09:26,200
Well, how is it my fault?

1993
01:09:26,780 --> 01:09:27,140
Yeah.

1994
01:09:27,620 --> 01:09:29,940
Conrad fucking threw money on the ship.

1995
01:09:31,220 --> 01:09:32,920
Oh, hey, did we do okay?

1996
01:09:33,420 --> 01:09:34,540
Yeah, how did we do, man?

1997
01:09:34,780 --> 01:09:35,340
How did we do?

1998
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:36,620
He's laughing at us.

1999
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:39,280
You're getting to know these intrepid adventurers then.

2000
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:40,160
Yeah.

2001
01:09:40,340 --> 01:09:41,680
Alex and his little brother Brad.

2002
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:42,660
Are we doing okay?

2003
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:43,640
Trying to swim with the big fish.

2004
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:46,960
Both seem out of their depth.

2005
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:48,680
Yeah.

2006
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:49,480
And Julia.

2007
01:09:50,060 --> 01:09:50,540
Julia.

2008
01:09:50,540 --> 01:09:51,560
Oh, of Alex's life.

2009
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:53,060
I don't know.

2010
01:09:53,060 --> 01:09:54,600
After what Mint did, I don't know anymore.

2011
01:09:54,980 --> 01:09:55,400
I don't know about that.

2012
01:09:57,720 --> 01:10:01,420
It's not one diving trip that's gonna destroy their relationship.

2013
01:10:03,060 --> 01:10:04,260
Captain Fliss.

2014
01:10:04,820 --> 01:10:05,420
Strong.

2015
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:06,760
Forthright.

2016
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:08,400
Stubborn.

2017
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:09,840
Stubborn.

2018
01:10:10,620 --> 01:10:13,220
Do I detect a spark between her and Conrad?

2019
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:18,880
We're gonna force them to like each other.

2020
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:21,840
Wait, we have a special feature unlocked.

2021
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:23,300
That's a special feature.

2022
01:10:23,620 --> 01:10:26,040
And some I think they may regret.

2023
01:10:26,300 --> 01:10:28,000
His jacket looks like a...

2024
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,240
giraffe.

2025
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:30,860
Like a cantaloupe skin.

2026
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:33,860
Apparently we made some decisions that they're gonna regret later.

2027
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:35,120
Nooo.

2028
01:10:35,680 --> 01:10:36,680
I mean they'll regret.

2029
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:40,500
I think you made some decisions that they're gonna regret later.

2030
01:10:41,500 --> 01:10:42,140
Nooo.

2031
01:10:42,660 --> 01:10:43,960
It was like traveling through time.

2032
01:10:43,960 --> 01:10:44,720
No shit.

2033
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:51,500
It was like traveling through time and accidentally ending up in a dimension where the past is underwater and like everything is covered in barnacles.

2034
01:10:51,620 --> 01:10:52,680
I think Julia is stupid.

2035
01:10:55,100 --> 01:10:57,080
Well I like them stupid.

2036
01:10:57,960 --> 01:11:02,300
It was like traveling to the past but everything is underwater and everything is covered in barnacles.

2037
01:11:02,680 --> 01:11:03,300
And sharks.

2038
01:11:05,460 --> 01:11:07,820
I can't believe there's sharks in the ocean.

2039
01:11:07,960 --> 01:11:08,720
Did you know that?

2040
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:17,520
I didn't even meet... oh wait.

2041
01:11:17,660 --> 01:11:19,200
I'm Brad now.

2042
01:11:19,300 --> 01:11:19,860
Wait, who are you?

2043
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:22,520
I'm watching... oh I'm Julia.

2044
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:23,080
I'm Julia.

2045
01:11:23,300 --> 01:11:23,820
You're Julia?

2046
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:26,140
You got the short end of the stick.

2047
01:11:26,860 --> 01:11:28,240
I'm gonna eavesdrop.

2048
01:11:28,780 --> 01:11:30,520
I can read you from a mile away.

2049
01:11:31,060 --> 01:11:31,660
Something's up.

2050
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:32,180
Oh wait.

2051
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:33,760
Why are you in my cutscene?

2052
01:11:35,580 --> 01:11:37,080
I don't know what's going on!

2053
01:11:39,620 --> 01:11:40,700
Don't fuck this up!

2054
01:11:41,900 --> 01:11:42,340
Privacy?

2055
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:43,540
Oh you got it!

2056
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:44,200
Oh damn it!

2057
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:48,600
Okay don't worry I'll watch from here.

2058
01:11:48,940 --> 01:11:49,840
Uh... yeah.

2059
01:11:50,060 --> 01:11:50,540
Maybe.

2060
01:11:50,820 --> 01:11:52,980
I mean... I don't know.

2061
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:54,100
I think so.

2062
01:11:54,280 --> 01:11:55,120
You think so?

2063
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:56,320
Well you know so.

2064
01:11:57,420 --> 01:11:57,940
Oh my god.

2065
01:11:57,940 --> 01:11:58,220
Is everything okay?

2066
01:11:58,620 --> 01:12:00,400
Why is he on the car?

2067
01:12:02,460 --> 01:12:03,900
Yeah is everything okay?

2068
01:12:04,160 --> 01:12:05,640
What are you gonna do?

2069
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:08,500
Are you gonna ruin a 10 year relationship?

2070
01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:15,220
That's fine.

2071
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:15,840
It's fine.

2072
01:12:17,980 --> 01:12:18,760
What's going on?

2073
01:12:19,420 --> 01:12:19,860
Look.

2074
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:23,000
When we get home we can talk about some stuff.

2075
01:12:23,020 --> 01:12:24,460
What do you mean we can talk about some stuff?

2076
01:12:24,680 --> 01:12:26,180
I mean it's not like we're breaking up.

2077
01:12:26,260 --> 01:12:27,060
Wait what are you doing?

2078
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:28,400
No!

2079
01:12:28,580 --> 01:12:29,860
What are you doing to our relationship?

2080
01:12:31,780 --> 01:12:32,220
Stop.

2081
01:12:33,180 --> 01:12:33,780
Got it.

2082
01:12:34,240 --> 01:12:35,740
Oh my god this guy.

2083
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:37,940
He acts like an AI for real.

2084
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:39,940
Brad is right there!

2085
01:12:40,280 --> 01:12:41,160
Are you a brother?

2086
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:42,100
Or Fliss?

2087
01:12:42,100 --> 01:12:44,000
Uh no I...

2088
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,420
Yeah I got distracted.

2089
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:46,680
Let's go get him.

2090
01:12:46,740 --> 01:12:49,340
I got distracted with this conversation.

2091
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:50,320
Wait are they like making out downstairs?

2092
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:51,280
Are they?

2093
01:12:52,240 --> 01:12:52,800
Oh!

2094
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:55,400
I did that.

2095
01:12:55,460 --> 01:12:56,280
You're welcome man.

2096
01:12:59,460 --> 01:13:01,880
I worked so hard on this for you.

2097
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:02,780
Jesus Christ Conrad.

2098
01:13:02,900 --> 01:13:03,600
What did he do?

2099
01:13:06,860 --> 01:13:07,920
What's going on?

2100
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:10,320
Please try to interrupt your seven seconds in heaven.

2101
01:13:11,020 --> 01:13:11,980
Oh yeah.

2102
01:13:12,100 --> 01:13:12,540
The beers.

2103
01:13:13,220 --> 01:13:14,400
I was just getting them now.

2104
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:15,100
What?

2105
01:13:15,500 --> 01:13:16,740
We're not gonna address that.

2106
01:13:16,980 --> 01:13:17,560
We're not gonna.

2107
01:13:17,700 --> 01:13:18,060
We're just gonna.

2108
01:13:18,140 --> 01:13:21,400
Oh man you worked so hard and I brought it home run.

2109
01:13:21,500 --> 01:13:22,540
I brought it home for you.

2110
01:13:22,620 --> 01:13:23,460
And you tried to.

2111
01:13:23,460 --> 01:13:23,800
No.

2112
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:27,460
You tried to sabotage it after I worked so hard for it.

2113
01:13:27,780 --> 01:13:29,400
It's a seven year relationship.

2114
01:13:29,540 --> 01:13:32,040
If they weren't going strong they would.

2115
01:13:32,360 --> 01:13:32,820
I...

2116
01:13:32,820 --> 01:13:35,100
My intervention would mean nothing.

2117
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:39,020
Maybe we can figure out why the planes are not working.

2118
01:13:39,020 --> 01:13:41,160
What happened underwater man?

2119
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:42,360
What happened?

2120
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:47,660
Oh search for the nav pad.

2121
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:48,420
What the hell is that?

2122
01:13:48,420 --> 01:13:49,240
You got the nav pad divemaster Jay?

2123
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:50,100
Oh no.

2124
01:13:50,240 --> 01:13:50,840
Not yet.

2125
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:51,640
What's that?

2126
01:13:51,900 --> 01:13:52,760
What's the nav pad?

2127
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:54,560
Oh this thing.

2128
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:55,620
You alright?

2129
01:13:55,940 --> 01:13:56,140
You alright?

2130
01:13:56,480 --> 01:13:57,640
You seem kind of preoccupied.

2131
01:13:57,640 --> 01:13:57,920
Yeah.

2132
01:13:58,140 --> 01:13:59,180
I'm grabbing it.

2133
01:13:59,300 --> 01:14:00,060
I'm grabbing it.

2134
01:14:00,360 --> 01:14:00,620
Sorry.

2135
01:14:01,160 --> 01:14:02,020
Wait is this it?

2136
01:14:02,240 --> 01:14:03,300
What is this?

2137
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:05,380
I'm talking to my brother.

2138
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:09,420
What am I doing?

2139
01:14:09,460 --> 01:14:10,140
How do you think the day went?

2140
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:11,140
Oh I'm looking at the pictures.

2141
01:14:11,140 --> 01:14:13,260
Other than our little tight at night with the locals.

2142
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:13,980
Pretty good.

2143
01:14:14,260 --> 01:14:16,120
People always say they had diving experience.

2144
01:14:16,340 --> 01:14:17,500
But Alex and Julia seems to actually know what they're doing.

2145
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:18,300
Air rescue service.

2146
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:19,640
Conwin Islands.

2147
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:21,960
So...

2148
01:14:21,960 --> 01:14:23,060
Oh that's me.

2149
01:14:23,140 --> 01:14:23,800
We going again tomorrow?

2150
01:14:24,680 --> 01:14:25,220
That's me.

2151
01:14:26,780 --> 01:14:27,800
Oh I can't wait.

2152
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:29,220
Sign me up.

2153
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:29,480
That's me.

2154
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:30,860
Can't wait to see this sucker for myself.

2155
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:31,980
What are you doing man?

2156
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:35,500
We're having a conversation with everybody except for Julia.

2157
01:14:36,380 --> 01:14:36,820
I'm looking at the pictures.

2158
01:14:36,820 --> 01:14:37,120
Oh sorry.

2159
01:14:37,200 --> 01:14:38,160
I was looking at pictures.

2160
01:14:39,580 --> 01:14:40,580
You got a girlfriend?

2161
01:14:40,780 --> 01:14:41,000
Yeah.

2162
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:42,080
Oh.

2163
01:14:42,980 --> 01:14:43,260
What?

2164
01:14:44,160 --> 01:14:44,720
Yeah.

2165
01:14:45,960 --> 01:14:47,940
Oh I thought it was a tablet.

2166
01:14:49,260 --> 01:14:50,380
I did.

2167
01:14:50,620 --> 01:14:51,100
What?

2168
01:14:51,480 --> 01:14:52,720
See I did that.

2169
01:14:52,860 --> 01:14:53,540
What did you do?

2170
01:14:54,020 --> 01:14:54,840
Women right?

2171
01:14:55,020 --> 01:14:55,220
Oh.

2172
01:14:55,720 --> 01:14:57,560
I'm making out with Alex right now.

2173
01:14:57,940 --> 01:14:58,620
Right here.

2174
01:15:01,740 --> 01:15:03,000
Wait you kissed Alex?

2175
01:15:03,680 --> 01:15:04,240
Yeah.

2176
01:15:04,620 --> 01:15:05,720
You fixed it.

2177
01:15:07,660 --> 01:15:09,520
You fixed the problem you caused.

2178
01:15:10,140 --> 01:15:10,760
Well yeah.

2179
01:15:10,820 --> 01:15:10,980
No I didn't.

2180
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:12,000
No I did.

2181
01:15:13,140 --> 01:15:14,280
I caused that.

2182
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:15,160
I mean I caused it.

2183
01:15:15,220 --> 01:15:15,920
Yes yeah you did.

2184
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:16,860
You did cause it.

2185
01:15:17,060 --> 01:15:17,760
It's blooming.

2186
01:15:18,020 --> 01:15:18,420
It's blooming.

2187
01:15:18,820 --> 01:15:21,100
If you did decompress too fast then you should go easy on the beer.

2188
01:15:21,300 --> 01:15:22,080
Alex I'm fine.

2189
01:15:22,220 --> 01:15:24,220
I think if I got the bends I would know by now.

2190
01:15:24,460 --> 01:15:25,320
I think I'm fine.

2191
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:25,820
Not always.

2192
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:28,660
Sometimes the bends can be super delayed.

2193
01:15:28,900 --> 01:15:30,680
It could be hours or a day or two.

2194
01:15:30,820 --> 01:15:30,860
What's the bends?

2195
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:31,760
The bends?

2196
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:32,800
Yeah what's the bends?

2197
01:15:33,080 --> 01:15:35,340
It's when you come up from a dive too fast.

2198
01:15:35,620 --> 01:15:36,480
Oh oh oh yeah.

2199
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:37,920
Decompression sickness.

2200
01:15:38,020 --> 01:15:38,360
Oh.

2201
01:15:38,540 --> 01:15:38,940
Nerd.

2202
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:39,920
Nerd.

2203
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:40,220
Wow.

2204
01:15:40,520 --> 01:15:40,920
What?

2205
01:15:40,940 --> 01:15:40,980
What?

2206
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:42,200
All caps.

2207
01:15:43,060 --> 01:15:43,920
It's really serious.

2208
01:15:44,280 --> 01:15:46,820
Divers get sick and die from decompression sickness every year.

2209
01:15:46,900 --> 01:15:51,840
And that is why the good Dr. Conrad says drink them if you got them cause either you're fine or you're gonna want a little something.

2210
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:53,680
I don't think I want to listen to Dr. Conrad.

2211
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:54,140
Yeah.

2212
01:15:54,380 --> 01:15:54,780
Yeah.

2213
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:57,340
I think Alex is an actual doctor.

2214
01:15:57,500 --> 01:15:57,900
Yeah.

2215
01:15:58,100 --> 01:16:00,160
Take orders from this guy just drink a beer.

2216
01:16:00,500 --> 01:16:01,240
Bro what?

2217
01:16:01,420 --> 01:16:02,220
Oh no I have to make the decision.

2218
01:16:02,220 --> 01:16:03,180
Man don't you dare.

2219
01:16:04,140 --> 01:16:05,360
You gotta listen to Conrad.

2220
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:06,060
Beer o'clock.

2221
01:16:06,580 --> 01:16:07,380
Beer o'clock.

2222
01:16:08,180 --> 01:16:08,580
Nerd.

2223
01:16:10,180 --> 01:16:10,960
Are you serious?

2224
01:16:12,520 --> 01:16:16,720
Oh my god if she dies it's on you.

2225
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:20,480
Manchurian GOLD.

2226
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:23,880
Literally doctors orders and you're like beer o'clock.

2227
01:16:23,980 --> 01:16:24,400
Beer o'clock.

2228
01:16:26,300 --> 01:16:28,160
These are coordinates all right.

2229
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:31,200
Let me listen to my brother who throws money at problems.

2230
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:32,700
Hey I'm not Julia.

2231
01:16:32,920 --> 01:16:34,040
You'll be Julia eventually.

2232
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:38,740
I have to be Julia to take care of the mess you make.

2233
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:40,700
I'm going to take care of the mess you made.

2234
01:16:40,720 --> 01:16:40,740
I'm going to take care of the mess you made.

2235
01:16:48,340 --> 01:16:49,740
Wait...

2236
01:16:51,480 --> 01:16:52,880
Superstition?

2237
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:54,140
Wait... what?

2238
01:16:55,400 --> 01:16:55,880
Superstition?

2239
01:16:56,160 --> 01:16:56,900
Is that it?

2240
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:57,280
Really?

2241
01:16:58,340 --> 01:16:58,820
Really?

2242
01:16:58,980 --> 01:17:00,700
The dead don't sleep well in these waters.

2243
01:17:00,940 --> 01:17:04,840
May sound silly enough to you all, but I was raised on this shit and it sticks.

2244
01:17:06,480 --> 01:17:06,960
Oooh...

2245
01:17:07,740 --> 01:17:09,980
Are you gonna call her like a liar?

2246
01:17:10,280 --> 01:17:10,800
Oh come on...

2247
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:11,740
Yeah...

2248
01:17:12,840 --> 01:17:16,220
Maybe it's not Julia being a Karen, maybe it's you.

2249
01:17:16,460 --> 01:17:17,520
It's a Karen.

2250
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,740
No respect for anyone else's traditions.

2251
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:21,400
I just don't like Julia.

2252
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:21,680
Damn.

2253
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:22,860
I don't want anyone else to like her.

2254
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:23,660
I don't like Julia either.

2255
01:17:24,040 --> 01:17:24,300
It's bad luck.

2256
01:17:24,680 --> 01:17:29,720
You think you can scavenge down there and it makes no difference, but every single thing you bring back has an essence.

2257
01:17:30,120 --> 01:17:31,880
It's like a ghost you invite to the surface.

2258
01:17:32,160 --> 01:17:32,580
Here we go.

2259
01:17:33,100 --> 01:17:34,500
Oh my god, you're so rude!

2260
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:36,520
You never think about much of anything.

2261
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:37,500
You're so rude!

2262
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:39,060
You made it sound...

2263
01:17:39,060 --> 01:17:41,160
You made her rude!

2264
01:17:42,740 --> 01:17:46,220
People drown in these waters and you have to respect their resting place.

2265
01:17:46,460 --> 01:17:46,860
Damn straight.

2266
01:17:48,360 --> 01:17:50,140
Fred, you got a fun ghost story, right?

2267
01:17:50,680 --> 01:17:51,960
Oh, I do?

2268
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:52,280
Do you?

2269
01:17:53,540 --> 01:17:54,080
Come on, decide.

2270
01:17:54,180 --> 01:17:54,500
Say it.

2271
01:17:54,540 --> 01:17:55,040
Yeah, yeah.

2272
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:57,440
Once upon a time.

2273
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:02,820
Yeah, come on, let's hear it.

2274
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:03,060
Ooh.

2275
01:18:03,620 --> 01:18:04,640
Yeah, let's hear it.

2276
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:05,200
Let's hear it.

2277
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:06,460
Let's hear it.

2278
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:08,080
I bet you can spin a good yarn.

2279
01:18:08,460 --> 01:18:10,040
It's kind of messed up, actually.

2280
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:10,800
Oh.

2281
01:18:10,900 --> 01:18:11,220
Yeah.

2282
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:13,040
Scare away, little bro.

2283
01:18:13,980 --> 01:18:14,960
Okay, here goes.

2284
01:18:15,720 --> 01:18:16,900
This story is true.

2285
01:18:17,180 --> 01:18:20,260
It had happened right near here in an old lighthouse.

2286
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:21,360
Classic setup.

2287
01:18:21,560 --> 01:18:21,940
Wait, what?

2288
01:18:24,180 --> 01:18:26,680
I thought Alex already knew the story.

2289
01:18:26,940 --> 01:18:28,060
Why are you deciding?

2290
01:18:28,180 --> 01:18:28,740
Like you don't know what's going on?

2291
01:18:28,740 --> 01:18:29,780
A creepy old guy.

2292
01:18:30,140 --> 01:18:35,600
Well, down by the dockside, I found an ancient old man, skin like a letter book, eye patch wooden legs...

2293
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:36,300
Why did you wiggle up?

2294
01:18:37,560 --> 01:18:38,760
...you told me a secret.

2295
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:40,360
For just a dollar.

2296
01:18:40,920 --> 01:18:41,020
Okay.

2297
01:18:41,020 --> 01:18:42,280
Here we go.

2298
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:43,000
Okay.

2299
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:46,960
The lighthouse stood atop an atoll, isolated from the rest of the world.

2300
01:18:47,020 --> 01:18:48,960
Because it was a spooky lighthouse.

2301
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:49,960
Yeah.

2302
01:18:50,580 --> 01:18:51,920
The lighthouse keeper would hear the sound of the light.

2303
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:54,160
He heard the waves pounding the rocky shore.

2304
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:54,920
Okay.

2305
01:18:55,080 --> 01:18:57,160
One misty morning, he comes upon a woman.

2306
01:18:57,340 --> 01:18:57,780
Oh.

2307
01:18:57,840 --> 01:18:58,540
Covered in blood.

2308
01:18:58,640 --> 01:18:59,080
Oh.

2309
01:18:59,220 --> 01:18:59,660
Women?

2310
01:19:00,300 --> 01:19:03,520
He hurries to her aid and she falls into his arms, sobbing.

2311
01:19:03,620 --> 01:19:04,340
Oh my god.

2312
01:19:04,360 --> 01:19:07,040
As he hurries her back to the lighthouse, he asks where she's from.

2313
01:19:07,220 --> 01:19:08,380
He doesn't waste any time.

2314
01:19:08,720 --> 01:19:09,160
Smooth.

2315
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:11,780
Conrad, shut up.

2316
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:12,160
Conrad.

2317
01:19:12,500 --> 01:19:13,420
Yeah, shut up.

2318
01:19:13,440 --> 01:19:14,020
Shut up.

2319
01:19:19,060 --> 01:19:20,740
My parents are upstairs right now.

2320
01:19:21,020 --> 01:19:22,200
Dun dun dun.

2321
01:19:22,620 --> 01:19:24,320
The lighthouse keeper says, that isn't so.

2322
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:24,520
I'm sorry.

2323
01:19:24,540 --> 01:19:25,060
He's not here.

2324
01:19:25,060 --> 01:19:26,380
Of course, he's lived there alone for years.

2325
01:19:26,760 --> 01:19:28,300
And the woman becomes hysterical.

2326
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:29,980
His pupils are so dialy.

2327
01:19:29,980 --> 01:19:30,300
And his sister turns upstairs.

2328
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:32,660
So, they go to the top of the lighthouse.

2329
01:19:32,840 --> 01:19:36,160
And there, splayed out on the floor, is a man and a woman.

2330
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:36,620
Oh.

2331
01:19:36,780 --> 01:19:38,000
Totally murdered with an axe.

2332
01:19:38,100 --> 01:19:38,620
Oh my god.

2333
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:39,020
Where's an axe?

2334
01:19:39,420 --> 01:19:41,160
I mean, do people even use axes anymore?

2335
01:19:43,140 --> 01:19:46,460
I'm just reporting the facts.

2336
01:19:48,980 --> 01:19:50,940
Chopped up into little tiny giblets.

2337
01:19:51,620 --> 01:19:52,060
Giblets?

2338
01:19:53,740 --> 01:19:54,520
It's a good job.

2339
01:19:54,520 --> 01:19:55,100
That's a good story, man.

2340
01:19:55,240 --> 01:19:56,720
It's a very good story.

2341
01:19:58,300 --> 01:19:58,780
Wow.

2342
01:19:59,420 --> 01:20:01,480
You tell a better story then.

2343
01:20:03,060 --> 01:20:05,340
You're literally the one that asked for the story.

2344
01:20:06,020 --> 01:20:08,520
No, Julia, like, relationship went up.

2345
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:10,180
Come on, Zach.

2346
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:11,940
Say it was you.

2347
01:20:12,020 --> 01:20:12,420
You were the...

2348
01:20:12,420 --> 01:20:12,620
Oh.

2349
01:20:13,820 --> 01:20:15,000
I'm gonna do relax.

2350
01:20:15,380 --> 01:20:17,040
The woman says, he was my husband.

2351
01:20:17,440 --> 01:20:18,960
And she turns to the closet.

2352
01:20:19,320 --> 01:20:21,180
Says, he's in there.

2353
01:20:21,580 --> 01:20:22,900
I asked the husband.

2354
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:24,080
And that's why.

2355
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:24,240
Oh.

2356
01:20:24,380 --> 01:20:24,460
Oh.

2357
01:20:25,580 --> 01:20:26,060
Oh.

2358
01:20:26,300 --> 01:20:27,500
She was a lighthouse keeper.

2359
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:27,720
She was a lighthouse keeper.

2360
01:20:27,720 --> 01:20:28,580
No, Alex.

2361
01:20:28,900 --> 01:20:29,220
No!

2362
01:20:29,420 --> 01:20:31,600
Alex is putting his head in his hands right now.

2363
01:20:31,900 --> 01:20:33,740
Sure enough, there's a man beside.

2364
01:20:34,120 --> 01:20:34,600
What?

2365
01:20:34,740 --> 01:20:36,680
But he's cut his own throat.

2366
01:20:37,160 --> 01:20:37,600
Oh.

2367
01:20:38,760 --> 01:20:41,480
He looks closer to see the dead man's face in the dark.

2368
01:20:42,220 --> 01:20:42,700
Closer.

2369
01:20:43,720 --> 01:20:44,200
Closer.

2370
01:20:45,020 --> 01:20:45,880
And he sees...

2371
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:46,320
Oh my god.

2372
01:20:46,340 --> 01:20:46,740
The uncanny...

2373
01:20:47,260 --> 01:20:47,760
It's his own face.

2374
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:48,140
I know.

2375
01:20:49,100 --> 01:20:51,300
And then its eyes bulge out and screams.

2376
01:20:52,820 --> 01:20:54,040
What the fuck?

2377
01:20:54,060 --> 01:20:54,500
Oh my god.

2378
01:20:54,500 --> 01:20:57,840
Where did that come from?

2379
01:20:58,120 --> 01:21:00,140
I think Brad is possessed.

2380
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:01,980
Yeah, I think I'm...

2381
01:21:02,250 --> 01:21:04,280
I think he's possessed.

2382
01:21:04,440 --> 01:21:05,500
Holy shit.

2383
01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:08,060
Oh, come on.

2384
01:21:08,100 --> 01:21:08,780
That wasn't scary.

2385
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:10,460
Okay.

2386
01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:14,920
Do better next time, Brad.

2387
01:21:15,200 --> 01:21:15,560
Do better next time, Brad.

2388
01:21:15,560 --> 01:21:15,700
Do better next time, Brad.

2389
01:21:15,860 --> 01:21:17,940
Doki, pick better prompts next time.

2390
01:21:17,960 --> 01:21:19,400
Wow, I saw you scream.

2391
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:21,260
I saw the screams around me.

2392
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:24,480
Wow, I saw you scream.

2393
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:24,480
I saw the screams around me.

2394
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:26,240
What regular issues are these?

2395
01:21:26,920 --> 01:21:29,640
It's standard issue, regulatory issues...

2396
01:21:29,640 --> 01:21:31,560
I don't think I trust Conrad with anything.

2397
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:32,960
I don't either.

2398
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:34,260
I feel like he's like...

2399
01:21:34,260 --> 01:21:39,260
He's like that type of guy that's like, I'm gonna tell my dad what you said about me.

2400
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:39,960
Yeah!

2401
01:21:40,660 --> 01:21:43,380
Did we not notice the storm that's incoming?

2402
01:21:43,620 --> 01:21:46,080
And we're on a tiny little boat that's gonna capsize.

2403
01:21:48,680 --> 01:21:49,680
Uh-oh.

2404
01:21:49,780 --> 01:21:51,480
Oh no, now there's a storm.

2405
01:21:52,100 --> 01:21:53,180
I think we're in trouble.

2406
01:21:57,850 --> 01:21:59,230
I think we fucked up.

2407
01:21:59,330 --> 01:22:00,690
I think we messed up, yeah.

2408
01:22:00,870 --> 01:22:01,130
Yeah.

2409
01:22:02,930 --> 01:22:03,610
Uh-oh.

2410
01:22:03,650 --> 01:22:06,230
You think those guys are gonna come back and...

2411
01:22:06,230 --> 01:22:07,030
The fishermen?

2412
01:22:07,390 --> 01:22:07,910
Yeah.

2413
01:22:10,330 --> 01:22:11,790
What the fuck?

2414
01:22:11,890 --> 01:22:13,010
Where did they come from?

2415
01:22:13,410 --> 01:22:15,230
Did you bring stuff up to the ship?

2416
01:22:15,650 --> 01:22:16,750
It was the tablet!

2417
01:22:17,070 --> 01:22:18,690
You brought a tablet?!

2418
01:22:18,690 --> 01:22:20,410
That's why we looked at the gold!

2419
01:22:20,790 --> 01:22:21,930
Uh-oh.

2420
01:22:21,930 --> 01:22:22,490
Uh-oh.

2421
01:22:23,730 --> 01:22:26,010
They have opposable thumbs.

2422
01:22:28,010 --> 01:22:28,730
They're fine.

2423
01:22:28,850 --> 01:22:29,370
We're fine.

2424
01:22:29,410 --> 01:22:30,010
We're fine.

2425
01:22:30,230 --> 01:22:31,590
They're looking over us.

2426
01:22:31,810 --> 01:22:33,150
Is that the ship?

2427
01:22:33,210 --> 01:22:35,090
That guy looks human.

2428
01:22:36,190 --> 01:22:37,530
Wait, are they the pirates?

2429
01:22:38,230 --> 01:22:39,310
Oh my god, he's got a gun!

2430
01:22:39,470 --> 01:22:40,010
Oh my god.

2431
01:22:41,070 --> 01:22:42,110
What do I...

2432
01:22:42,110 --> 01:22:46,210
I tried right-triggering, but it didn't let me do anything.

2433
01:22:46,490 --> 01:22:48,130
I think he's about to die.

2434
01:22:48,550 --> 01:22:49,470
What did you do?

2435
01:22:49,670 --> 01:22:52,190
Did you not do your quick time offense?

2436
01:22:52,630 --> 01:22:54,870
I couldn't figure out where I was supposed to go!

2437
01:22:54,870 --> 01:22:56,570
I couldn't figure out where I was supposed to go!

2438
01:22:56,790 --> 01:22:57,550
Oh my god!

2439
01:22:57,670 --> 01:22:59,570
I did my quick time offense!

2440
01:23:02,090 --> 01:23:04,630
What the hell?!

2441
01:23:04,630 --> 01:23:06,270
Look at where it's gotten you.

2442
01:23:06,350 --> 01:23:07,230
You're still trapped too.

2443
01:23:07,470 --> 01:23:09,710
Because you failed the quick time offense!

2444
01:23:11,370 --> 01:23:13,370
I tried to get the gun from his head!

2445
01:23:16,940 --> 01:23:17,700
Where's Brad?

2446
01:23:19,200 --> 01:23:20,540
Oh, there's Fliss.

2447
01:23:22,700 --> 01:23:23,660
Oh, there they are!

2448
01:23:23,700 --> 01:23:24,240
That's the fishermen!

2449
01:23:24,440 --> 01:23:25,120
That's the pirates!

2450
01:23:25,240 --> 01:23:25,980
I told you!

2451
01:23:26,240 --> 01:23:27,500
This guy means business.

2452
01:23:27,880 --> 01:23:29,120
Why'd you piss him off?

2453
01:23:29,420 --> 01:23:32,280
Why did Conrad piss him off?!

2454
01:23:32,280 --> 01:23:33,320
Because you pissed him off!

2455
01:23:33,340 --> 01:23:34,500
You threw money at them!

2456
01:23:34,660 --> 01:23:35,240
It's your fault!

2457
01:23:35,240 --> 01:23:36,640
I can't control Conrad!

2458
01:23:36,860 --> 01:23:38,540
Nobody can control Conrad!

2459
01:23:41,060 --> 01:23:42,340
It's your fault!

2460
01:23:42,340 --> 01:23:42,520
It's your fault!

2461
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:43,620
Oh, you're deciding.

2462
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,300
Okay, Conrad, what's your genius idea this time?

2463
01:23:47,680 --> 01:23:48,980
What is she doing?

2464
01:23:49,140 --> 01:23:50,340
She's crying on his...

2465
01:23:50,340 --> 01:23:51,380
What is happening?

2466
01:23:51,580 --> 01:23:52,060
I don't know!

2467
01:23:52,240 --> 01:23:55,400
I don't want to do this!

2468
01:23:56,240 --> 01:23:57,000
I don't want to do this!

2469
01:23:58,340 --> 01:24:00,720
Oh, oh, but I missed my event.

2470
01:24:00,920 --> 01:24:02,060
That was my fault.

2471
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:04,640
I'm trying to... I'm trying to do this right now!

2472
01:24:07,560 --> 01:24:08,940
Did you miss it?

2473
01:24:08,980 --> 01:24:09,680
You missed it!

2474
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:13,440
There was no... Okay.

2475
01:24:13,820 --> 01:24:15,060
Oh, no, oh, no.

2476
01:24:15,380 --> 01:24:17,000
You're so good at this.

2477
01:24:17,100 --> 01:24:17,600
I have to choose.

2478
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:18,860
You do it then.

2479
01:24:19,060 --> 01:24:20,500
You're gonna see what I meant.

2480
01:24:21,380 --> 01:24:21,900
Yeah?

2481
01:24:22,440 --> 01:24:23,480
I did it!

2482
01:24:23,480 --> 01:24:24,580
How did you do it?

2483
01:24:28,340 --> 01:24:32,400
I had to choose between Conrad and Julia.

2484
01:24:32,960 --> 01:24:34,220
Okay, let me try this again.

2485
01:24:35,220 --> 01:24:36,880
How did you do it?

2486
01:24:36,980 --> 01:24:38,360
This is how we're gonna die.

2487
01:24:38,520 --> 01:24:39,840
How did you do it?

2488
01:24:40,040 --> 01:24:42,880
I right trigger and then I pull with the right.

2489
01:24:43,280 --> 01:24:44,720
I'm trying to pull!

2490
01:24:44,820 --> 01:24:45,800
Let me pull!

2491
01:24:47,440 --> 01:24:48,840
So I lose your right.

2492
01:24:48,920 --> 01:24:49,860
I swear!

2493
01:24:49,860 --> 01:24:50,460
I swear!

2494
01:24:50,680 --> 01:24:51,740
I do it!

2495
01:24:51,820 --> 01:24:52,840
I swear to God!

2496
01:24:52,940 --> 01:24:54,060
I swear to God!

2497
01:24:54,220 --> 01:24:55,160
I swear to God!

2498
01:24:55,740 --> 01:24:57,500
This will never be...

2499
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:00,680
Alright, you fucking do it again.

2500
01:25:01,100 --> 01:25:01,860
I'll do it!

2501
01:25:01,860 --> 01:25:02,280
I'll do it!

2502
01:25:02,280 --> 01:25:02,800
I'll do it!

2503
01:25:03,680 --> 01:25:04,440
I'll do it!

2504
01:25:04,460 --> 01:25:04,820
I'll do it!

2505
01:25:05,060 --> 01:25:06,060
Okay, watch this.

2506
01:25:06,100 --> 01:25:06,780
It's so easy.

2507
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:08,020
I don't understand!

2508
01:25:08,020 --> 01:25:08,760
How did you do that?

2509
01:25:09,020 --> 01:25:09,720
How did you?

2510
01:25:09,820 --> 01:25:10,980
How did you do it?

2511
01:25:11,540 --> 01:25:12,440
Okay, your turn.

2512
01:25:13,040 --> 01:25:14,140
Oh, never mind!

2513
01:25:14,480 --> 01:25:14,480
Oh, no.

2514
01:25:15,680 --> 01:25:16,900
Why is he bleeding?

2515
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:20,740
Where's Brad?

2516
01:25:22,180 --> 01:25:22,880
Oh, no.

2517
01:25:23,120 --> 01:25:23,340
Hey!

2518
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:24,680
Hey!

2519
01:25:26,120 --> 01:25:28,800
I gotta turn the sound down again on this thing.

2520
01:25:28,840 --> 01:25:29,500
It's so bad.

2521
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:31,500
I don't understand!

2522
01:25:32,060 --> 01:25:33,560
How did you guys do it?

2523
01:25:34,480 --> 01:25:37,400
Wow, you let Fliss die because you couldn't un-gag her.

2524
01:25:37,560 --> 01:25:38,440
I can't understand!

2525
01:25:42,440 --> 01:25:44,380
How did you do it?

2526
01:25:48,260 --> 01:25:49,560
Hey, so, uh...

2527
01:25:50,900 --> 01:25:51,960
What's the good news?

2528
01:25:52,740 --> 01:25:54,740
The bad news is these are kinda...

2529
01:25:54,740 --> 01:25:57,120
maybe the fishermen I pissed off earlier...

2530
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:58,160
Oh my God, Conrad!

2531
01:25:59,020 --> 01:25:59,780
...just great!

2532
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:00,820
And the good news?

2533
01:26:01,060 --> 01:26:02,640
I recognize them.

2534
01:26:02,740 --> 01:26:03,160
What?

2535
01:26:03,680 --> 01:26:04,700
How's that good news?

2536
01:26:04,980 --> 01:26:06,400
They're such an idiot!

2537
01:26:06,620 --> 01:26:06,860
Jesus!

2538
01:26:08,120 --> 01:26:08,860
Oh, wait.

2539
01:26:09,100 --> 01:26:09,580
Um...

2540
01:26:09,580 --> 01:26:10,860
I'm gonna untie him.

2541
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:13,080
We have to get free, right now!

2542
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:14,660
Yeah, come here.

2543
01:26:14,740 --> 01:26:15,500
Come here, Conrad.

2544
01:26:17,240 --> 01:26:18,660
Put on some pants, man!

2545
01:26:18,660 --> 01:26:19,840
Wait, did you have to hold your pants?

2546
01:26:19,860 --> 01:26:21,100
Did you hold down the right stick?

2547
01:26:21,300 --> 01:26:22,340
Until it came off?

2548
01:26:22,540 --> 01:26:22,760
Yes!

2549
01:26:24,280 --> 01:26:26,120
Why did you say that?

2550
01:26:26,460 --> 01:26:27,360
I told you!

2551
01:26:29,260 --> 01:26:30,160
Look, look.

2552
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:32,620
I didn't realize you had to hold it.

2553
01:26:35,200 --> 01:26:36,540
Who's the gamer now?

2554
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:38,820
You failed your QuickTime event twice.

2555
01:26:39,620 --> 01:26:40,140
What?

2556
01:26:40,360 --> 01:26:41,840
It was just the gun!

2557
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:43,820
Oh my God, this guy...

2558
01:26:43,820 --> 01:26:45,120
Oh, sit back down.

2559
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:45,820
Sit back down, idiot.

2560
01:26:46,300 --> 01:26:48,740
Wouldn't they think it's weird that we're un-gagged?

2561
01:26:49,560 --> 01:26:50,580
I know, right?

2562
01:26:51,040 --> 01:26:51,660
Alright.

2563
01:26:52,780 --> 01:26:55,020
I succeeded my QuickTime event.

2564
01:26:55,180 --> 01:26:55,680
Did you?

2565
01:26:55,980 --> 01:26:56,240
I did mine!

2566
01:26:56,280 --> 01:26:56,680
Okay.

2567
01:26:58,640 --> 01:27:00,700
I stopped you from getting...

2568
01:27:01,590 --> 01:27:02,460
beat up.

2569
01:27:02,980 --> 01:27:04,800
Conrad kinda deserves it, though.

2570
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:05,700
Wait, Conrad's gone.

2571
01:27:06,380 --> 01:27:07,380
Bye, Conrad.

2572
01:27:08,020 --> 01:27:11,600
Wait, are you getting taken away?

2573
01:27:11,780 --> 01:27:12,340
Yeah.

2574
01:27:12,460 --> 01:27:13,740
I'm seeing what's happening.

2575
01:27:14,160 --> 01:27:14,940
Oh, shit.

2576
01:27:14,940 --> 01:27:18,220
You can go fuck yourself, you piece of shit.

2577
01:27:18,820 --> 01:27:19,900
You're the little lady.

2578
01:27:20,120 --> 01:27:20,820
What's happening?

2579
01:27:21,180 --> 01:27:24,960
Oh, so like, the guy was like, you're fucked.

2580
01:27:25,540 --> 01:27:27,160
Oh, and then Conrad gets punched.

2581
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:28,560
I saw that.

2582
01:27:30,260 --> 01:27:31,560
Oh, where is he going?

2583
01:27:32,040 --> 01:27:32,520
Oh!

2584
01:27:33,300 --> 01:27:34,800
Oh my God, they're taking him out.

2585
01:27:35,060 --> 01:27:36,980
I mean, if they kill Conrad, that's okay, right?

2586
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:38,880
They're beating Conrad!

2587
01:27:39,300 --> 01:27:40,860
We don't care about that, right?

2588
01:27:44,480 --> 01:27:46,240
I'm making Julia scared.

2589
01:27:48,640 --> 01:27:49,080
I'm making Julia scared.

2590
01:27:49,080 --> 01:27:49,140
I'm making Julia scared.

2591
01:27:49,140 --> 01:27:49,900
Okay, what do you want?

2592
01:27:50,920 --> 01:27:52,040
What do you fuckers want?

2593
01:27:53,040 --> 01:27:54,500
Okay, I didn't say fuckers.

2594
01:27:54,600 --> 01:27:55,100
I said...

2595
01:27:59,320 --> 01:28:00,960
Wait, they're actually killing Conrad!

2596
01:28:01,200 --> 01:28:02,540
Wait, they're actually killing Conrad!

2597
01:28:02,860 --> 01:28:03,640
You did this!

2598
01:28:03,740 --> 01:28:04,500
You did this!

2599
01:28:04,500 --> 01:28:05,780
I just said, what do you want?

2600
01:28:06,860 --> 01:28:07,600
Please, just stop.

2601
01:28:08,040 --> 01:28:09,300
Y'all, you pissed him off.

2602
01:28:09,620 --> 01:28:09,960
Uh-oh.

2603
01:28:10,860 --> 01:28:12,400
Oh, wait, they have the gun?

2604
01:28:12,540 --> 01:28:13,380
Oh no, it's a knife!

2605
01:28:13,560 --> 01:28:14,800
I'm gonna say nothing.

2606
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:17,480
Don't say anything!

2607
01:28:17,780 --> 01:28:20,140
If I say something, I feel like they're gonna...

2608
01:28:20,140 --> 01:28:21,780
They're gonna get agitated.

2609
01:28:25,260 --> 01:28:25,760
What?

2610
01:28:25,880 --> 01:28:26,400
What is that?

2611
01:28:26,580 --> 01:28:28,200
I saved Conrad, you're welcome.

2612
01:28:29,020 --> 01:28:31,460
No, why would you want to save Conrad?

2613
01:28:32,300 --> 01:28:33,640
Because you told me to!

2614
01:28:35,160 --> 01:28:36,960
You literally told me to!

2615
01:28:37,980 --> 01:28:40,340
Oh, I got a cuticle cutter.

2616
01:28:40,460 --> 01:28:40,720
Oh, I got a cuticle cutter.

2617
01:28:40,860 --> 01:28:41,740
I'm cutting the ropes!

2618
01:28:43,580 --> 01:28:45,360
I'm gonna say nothing again.

2619
01:28:45,660 --> 01:28:46,180
Oh, they're coming back!

2620
01:28:46,380 --> 01:28:50,640
I feel like if I say something, they would agitate him more.

2621
01:28:52,060 --> 01:28:53,260
Oh, he's coming back!

2622
01:28:53,400 --> 01:28:53,860
I'm back!

2623
01:28:53,940 --> 01:28:54,560
I'm back, Conrad!

2624
01:28:57,160 --> 01:28:57,780
I'm back!

2625
01:28:57,900 --> 01:28:59,820
I saved Conrad just for you, Min!

2626
01:28:59,940 --> 01:29:01,620
I've kissed you love, Conrad, so much!

2627
01:29:04,220 --> 01:29:07,640
I wanna see him get us killed even in a different way.

2628
01:29:09,180 --> 01:29:10,840
I wanna see him get us killed even in a different way.

2629
01:29:10,840 --> 01:29:14,460
Yeah, I feel like you have higher survivability if he's dead.

2630
01:29:14,820 --> 01:29:15,340
Oh my god!

2631
01:29:15,340 --> 01:29:17,220
Alex, why did you get up so slowly?

2632
01:29:17,340 --> 01:29:19,240
You have no restraint!

2633
01:29:23,910 --> 01:29:25,390
Just open the door!

2634
01:29:28,190 --> 01:29:28,710
Uh,

2635
01:29:34,870 --> 01:29:35,070
wait.

2636
01:29:35,350 --> 01:29:36,070
What's going on?

2637
01:29:36,070 --> 01:29:36,310
You're in.

2638
01:29:37,230 --> 01:29:39,070
Uh, I'm with Conrad and Alex.

2639
01:29:39,210 --> 01:29:39,930
Oh, you're with us?

2640
01:29:40,090 --> 01:29:40,990
Oh, wait, whoa!

2641
01:29:41,170 --> 01:29:42,090
You're Conrad!

2642
01:29:42,630 --> 01:29:43,850
No, I'm Alex!

2643
01:29:44,050 --> 01:29:44,790
Oh, I'm Conrad!

2644
01:29:50,150 --> 01:29:51,250
I'm sure he's fine.

2645
01:29:51,950 --> 01:29:53,810
These guys probably just want money or something.

2646
01:29:54,250 --> 01:29:54,470
Yeah.

2647
01:29:55,570 --> 01:29:59,830
Man, if I let Conrad die here, I wouldn't have to be forced to play Conrad.

2648
01:30:02,170 --> 01:30:04,750
Everyone has to play Conrad at least once.

2649
01:30:06,270 --> 01:30:07,550
Even you, Chad.

2650
01:30:07,610 --> 01:30:10,650
Everyone has to feel the shame of being Conrad.

2651
01:30:11,490 --> 01:30:12,470
I thought he was gonna die.

2652
01:30:12,490 --> 01:30:16,210
Except by saving Conrad, you will have to deal with Conrad later.

2653
01:30:18,050 --> 01:30:18,570
Except by saving Conrad, you will have to deal with Conrad later.

2654
01:30:18,570 --> 01:30:20,390
No, they knew that you liked him so much.

2655
01:30:20,510 --> 01:30:22,990
I literally saved him for you!

2656
01:30:24,850 --> 01:30:26,150
What did they do to Julia?

2657
01:30:26,750 --> 01:30:27,690
Are you okay?

2658
01:30:27,930 --> 01:30:28,890
Are you okay, little Julia?

2659
01:30:30,790 --> 01:30:32,810
Are you okay, little girl?

2660
01:30:32,970 --> 01:30:32,990
Are you okay, little girl?

2661
01:30:33,050 --> 01:30:33,570
Okay.

2662
01:30:37,050 --> 01:30:37,570
What?

2663
01:30:38,690 --> 01:30:38,790
What?

2664
01:30:38,790 --> 01:30:39,010
What?

2665
01:30:40,090 --> 01:30:40,650
Oh.

2666
01:30:41,390 --> 01:30:43,030
It's gonna be a hostage situation.

2667
01:30:43,610 --> 01:30:44,130
Yeah.

2668
01:30:45,990 --> 01:30:46,790
There you go.

2669
01:30:46,830 --> 01:30:47,030
Nice.

2670
01:30:49,310 --> 01:30:51,730
What if everybody dies but Conrad?

2671
01:30:52,990 --> 01:30:53,550
What if everybody dies but Conrad?

2672
01:30:53,550 --> 01:30:54,170
Should we do that?

2673
01:30:54,210 --> 01:30:54,890
Make it a mission?

2674
01:30:55,310 --> 01:30:56,810
Keep Conrad alive!

2675
01:30:57,190 --> 01:30:58,730
Keep Conrad alive!

2676
01:31:02,810 --> 01:31:04,530
Is he just counting?

2677
01:31:04,870 --> 01:31:05,190
Yeah.

2678
01:31:05,370 --> 01:31:06,350
What is he counting?

2679
01:31:06,350 --> 01:31:10,130
Oh, I think he's seeing the time between the lightning and the thunder.

2680
01:31:10,210 --> 01:31:10,450
Oh.

2681
01:31:11,030 --> 01:31:11,730
That's smart.

2682
01:31:11,950 --> 01:31:12,890
Yeah, he is.

2683
01:31:13,550 --> 01:31:13,990
Wow.

2684
01:31:14,110 --> 01:31:15,430
Spoken like a true Conrad.

2685
01:31:17,510 --> 01:31:17,950
Wow.

2686
01:31:17,950 --> 01:31:18,370
Nerd.

2687
01:31:20,310 --> 01:31:20,750
Yeah.

2688
01:31:21,870 --> 01:31:22,910
Yeah, it's a speedboat.

2689
01:31:23,330 --> 01:31:24,310
The main guy here.

2690
01:31:24,810 --> 01:31:25,670
He's got a gun.

2691
01:31:25,790 --> 01:31:26,170
Uh oh.

2692
01:31:26,410 --> 01:31:30,010
Uh, I'm gonna... you know.

2693
01:31:30,830 --> 01:31:32,850
Well, at least one of us can get on the boat.

2694
01:31:34,810 --> 01:31:36,330
We're gonna get on that boat.

2695
01:31:36,330 --> 01:31:36,490
Oh.

2696
01:31:36,810 --> 01:31:37,210
Right.

2697
01:31:37,850 --> 01:31:38,850
Okay, I'm gonna say nothing.

2698
01:31:39,010 --> 01:31:40,670
So you have to get on the boat.

2699
01:31:44,570 --> 01:31:45,510
Oh, what do you think?

2700
01:31:45,570 --> 01:31:46,230
She's asking you.

2701
01:31:46,430 --> 01:31:48,010
We gotta break these off first.

2702
01:31:48,210 --> 01:31:48,590
Oh.

2703
01:31:49,050 --> 01:31:49,530
That's you.

2704
01:31:49,730 --> 01:31:50,090
That's you.

2705
01:31:50,170 --> 01:31:51,430
No, I didn't say anything!

2706
01:31:51,870 --> 01:31:53,110
Yes, you're gonna get through the window.

2707
01:31:53,150 --> 01:31:53,810
Yeah, good call!

2708
01:31:53,950 --> 01:31:54,930
No, Conrad!

2709
01:31:57,090 --> 01:31:58,130
Conrad the ghoul!

2710
01:31:58,250 --> 01:31:58,590
No!

2711
01:31:58,610 --> 01:31:59,690
I said nothing!

2712
01:32:02,330 --> 01:32:05,230
Okay, sneaking mission.

2713
01:32:06,330 --> 01:32:06,990
Oh no.

2714
01:32:07,550 --> 01:32:08,910
Oh no, please.

2715
01:32:09,690 --> 01:32:11,490
I don't wanna be Conrad anymore.

2716
01:32:12,550 --> 01:32:12,990
Three!

2717
01:32:13,430 --> 01:32:13,870
No!

2718
01:32:14,070 --> 01:32:15,330
I have to be Conrad!

2719
01:32:16,630 --> 01:32:17,190
Uh oh.

2720
01:32:17,270 --> 01:32:17,810
Uh oh.

2721
01:32:18,510 --> 01:32:19,350
Go Conrad!

2722
01:32:19,410 --> 01:32:19,610
Go!

2723
01:32:19,730 --> 01:32:20,310
Go Conrad!

2724
01:32:20,470 --> 01:32:21,270
Go Conrad!

2725
01:32:21,370 --> 01:32:21,590
Go!

2726
01:32:21,930 --> 01:32:22,350
Yeah.

2727
01:32:23,410 --> 01:32:24,510
Is this me?

2728
01:32:24,530 --> 01:32:25,490
Is this my quick time event?

2729
01:32:25,710 --> 01:32:26,150
Oh shoot.

2730
01:32:26,430 --> 01:32:26,590
Ah!

2731
01:32:27,270 --> 01:32:28,470
Don't fuck this up!

2732
01:32:28,610 --> 01:32:29,790
Don't fuck this up!

2733
01:32:30,350 --> 01:32:31,470
Don't fuck this up!

2734
01:32:32,310 --> 01:32:33,450
Don't fuck this up!

2735
01:32:34,030 --> 01:32:35,750
Um, I might have fucked it up a little bit.

2736
01:32:35,750 --> 01:32:36,310
What did you do?

2737
01:32:36,870 --> 01:32:39,030
I'm doing my quick time event right now!

2738
01:32:39,290 --> 01:32:40,490
I thought you said X.

2739
01:32:40,690 --> 01:32:42,270
What did you do?!

2740
01:32:42,270 --> 01:32:43,810
What did you do?!

2741
01:32:45,470 --> 01:32:46,270
I'm escaping.

2742
01:32:46,830 --> 01:32:46,850
Oh, Bradley!

2743
01:32:46,850 --> 01:32:47,550
I'm escaping.

2744
01:32:48,750 --> 01:32:49,590
Get out of here!

2745
01:32:49,630 --> 01:32:50,350
Get out of here, Conrad!

2746
01:32:50,550 --> 01:32:50,930
Go live!

2747
01:32:51,330 --> 01:32:52,610
Live a long life!

2748
01:32:53,070 --> 01:32:53,970
Oh my god!

2749
01:32:54,470 --> 01:32:55,330
Oh my god!

2750
01:32:56,610 --> 01:32:57,610
I did it!

2751
01:32:57,650 --> 01:32:57,930
I did it!

2752
01:32:57,990 --> 01:32:58,970
I think Fliss is gonna die.

2753
01:33:00,010 --> 01:33:01,570
I got... I have a hostage!

2754
01:33:01,670 --> 01:33:02,190
I have a hostage!

2755
01:33:03,310 --> 01:33:04,610
I went... I went and escaped.

2756
01:33:04,890 --> 01:33:05,810
I didn't grab a knife.

2757
01:33:06,250 --> 01:33:06,650
What?!

2758
01:33:06,650 --> 01:33:07,430
What do you mean?!

2759
01:33:09,250 --> 01:33:09,950
What do you mean?

2760
01:33:10,030 --> 01:33:11,950
Wait, what did you do?

2761
01:33:12,290 --> 01:33:13,510
I have a guy hostage.

2762
01:33:13,630 --> 01:33:14,390
I'm gonna kill him.

2763
01:33:14,610 --> 01:33:15,070
Oh my god!

2764
01:33:15,130 --> 01:33:16,310
There you are like Spider-Man!

2765
01:33:18,370 --> 01:33:18,770
Goodbye!

2766
01:33:21,970 --> 01:33:22,370
Goodbye!

2767
01:33:26,170 --> 01:33:26,890
Conrad's leaving!

2768
01:33:28,830 --> 01:33:29,890
Wait, I think they're gonna shoot me!

2769
01:33:30,030 --> 01:33:30,370
No!

2770
01:33:31,470 --> 01:33:32,550
They're gonna shoot Conrad!

2771
01:33:32,810 --> 01:33:33,490
Attack him!

2772
01:33:36,080 --> 01:33:37,400
I don't care about you, Julie!

2773
01:33:37,500 --> 01:33:38,220
Oh, I tried.

2774
01:33:38,380 --> 01:33:39,400
I really did try.

2775
01:33:40,640 --> 01:33:43,380
Oh my god.

2776
01:33:43,480 --> 01:33:44,020
Is he dead?

2777
01:33:44,160 --> 01:33:44,980
Did you dodge it?

2778
01:33:45,140 --> 01:33:45,820
Conrad's escaped!

2779
01:33:46,440 --> 01:33:46,940
We did it!

2780
01:33:47,080 --> 01:33:48,420
We saved Conrad!

2781
01:33:53,820 --> 01:33:55,900
We saved Conrad!

2782
01:34:00,700 --> 01:34:01,580
Conrad lives!

2783
01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:03,000
Conrad lives!

2784
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:10,360
We did it guys!

2785
01:34:11,780 --> 01:34:12,380
Conrad is dead!

2786
01:34:13,520 --> 01:34:16,700
Thank god I was Conrad and doing the quick time event.

2787
01:34:16,940 --> 01:34:18,020
I saved you!

2788
01:34:18,100 --> 01:34:19,860
I could've shielded Julia!

2789
01:34:20,620 --> 01:34:22,820
But I saved you instead.

2790
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,500
Yeah, cause you know we needed to save Conrad!

2791
01:34:26,460 --> 01:34:28,200
Yeah, cause you know we needed to save Conrad!

2792
01:34:28,480 --> 01:34:29,700
She is gone!

2793
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:30,500
Oh my god!

2794
01:34:31,840 --> 01:34:32,600
A little big adventure.

2795
01:34:32,920 --> 01:34:33,740
He's just Conrad.

2796
01:34:34,780 --> 01:34:36,780
Oh my god, we did it guys.

2797
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:41,420
Apparently, people were like, people usually never save Conrad.

2798
01:34:42,740 --> 01:34:45,120
He usually dies there.

2799
01:34:47,960 --> 01:34:49,480
Conrad deserves better.

2800
01:34:52,060 --> 01:34:52,700
Conrad?

2801
01:34:54,900 --> 01:34:56,500
We did it guys!

2802
01:34:58,300 --> 01:35:00,440
He's gonna be the hero in the end.

2803
01:35:00,440 --> 01:35:00,620
Yeah!

2804
01:35:01,640 --> 01:35:03,000
He's gonna do it.

2805
01:35:05,440 --> 01:35:07,760
Is the sound effects down real quick?

2806
01:35:07,980 --> 01:35:08,380
Yeah.

2807
01:35:09,320 --> 01:35:10,920
Okay, I'm turning them down again.

2808
01:35:10,980 --> 01:35:12,460
I'm gonna turn down as well.

2809
01:35:12,720 --> 01:35:13,900
I can't believe it.

2810
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:15,380
They're like, usually Conrad gets shot.

2811
01:35:15,480 --> 01:35:17,400
I don't know how you guys save him.

2812
01:35:21,440 --> 01:35:24,020
We have our priorities straight.

2813
01:35:25,180 --> 01:35:25,700
Absolutely.

2814
01:35:26,160 --> 01:35:27,280
Okay, I'm good.

2815
01:35:27,500 --> 01:35:30,220
The only two people who saved Conrad.

2816
01:35:33,320 --> 01:35:33,840
Willingly.

2817
01:35:34,220 --> 01:35:36,200
Not for like completionist sake.

2818
01:35:39,820 --> 01:35:40,340
Okay.

2819
01:35:41,020 --> 01:35:42,220
We're hostages.

2820
01:35:43,340 --> 01:35:43,860
Cool.

2821
01:35:44,080 --> 01:35:44,720
What do we do now?

2822
01:35:45,240 --> 01:35:46,580
She's like looking for him.

2823
01:35:48,060 --> 01:35:50,760
Why do you make all the important decisions?

2824
01:35:51,340 --> 01:35:51,860
Connie!

2825
01:35:53,180 --> 01:35:54,840
Shut the fuck up!

2826
01:35:54,980 --> 01:35:57,240
Why can't you wipe the blood off your face?

2827
01:35:58,020 --> 01:35:59,480
We were only talking.

2828
01:35:59,780 --> 01:36:01,360
There's no harm in just talking.

2829
01:36:01,480 --> 01:36:01,680
Yeah.

2830
01:36:03,700 --> 01:36:05,320
We practically won the game.

2831
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,940
We have one survivor so we basically won.

2832
01:36:10,720 --> 01:36:11,660
I'm just gonna say it.

2833
01:36:12,420 --> 01:36:13,860
Fliss has gotta be in on this.

2834
01:36:14,600 --> 01:36:16,480
What the fuck?

2835
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:18,900
You threw Fliss at it?

2836
01:36:18,900 --> 01:36:19,280
That bus?

2837
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:20,760
They barely laid a hand on her?

2838
01:36:22,160 --> 01:36:24,220
I bet you told them about the Manchurian gold.

2839
01:36:24,940 --> 01:36:25,800
They're in Cahoot.

2840
01:36:25,800 --> 01:36:26,940
They don't even know about the gold!

2841
01:36:27,060 --> 01:36:28,440
Why did you tell them about the gold?

2842
01:36:28,660 --> 01:36:29,740
Oh my god!

2843
01:36:31,340 --> 01:36:32,740
Well, Fliss, what do you have to say?

2844
01:36:32,960 --> 01:36:33,720
I can't believe what I'm hearing.

2845
01:36:33,860 --> 01:36:35,760
I just lost everything I have.

2846
01:36:35,880 --> 01:36:37,120
And this is what you think?

2847
01:36:37,960 --> 01:36:39,360
What do you mean you lost everything?

2848
01:36:40,020 --> 01:36:41,180
I lost my boat!

2849
01:36:41,300 --> 01:36:42,140
This is my boat!

2850
01:36:44,060 --> 01:36:45,140
Put a cork in it.

2851
01:36:46,920 --> 01:36:48,420
Oh my god.

2852
01:36:49,860 --> 01:36:50,540
Oh dang it.

2853
01:36:50,560 --> 01:36:52,260
That quick time event was to save Julia?

2854
01:36:59,460 --> 01:37:00,560
Oh, Fliss again.

2855
01:37:01,780 --> 01:37:03,280
Cahoots, cahoots, cahoots!

2856
01:37:03,520 --> 01:37:04,720
What happened to Brad?

2857
01:37:06,460 --> 01:37:07,840
Brad is right next to me!

2858
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:10,780
Why not?

2859
01:37:11,020 --> 01:37:12,260
Why won't you talk to me?

2860
01:37:13,160 --> 01:37:14,440
Move the gun.

2861
01:37:17,440 --> 01:37:19,260
We should save Julia next.

2862
01:37:20,440 --> 01:37:22,060
Save all the way.

2863
01:37:22,260 --> 01:37:23,580
We'll save the worst people.

2864
01:37:25,380 --> 01:37:26,740
They can have each other.

2865
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:28,480
Julia and her brother.

2866
01:37:28,500 --> 01:37:29,240
They can have each other.

2867
01:37:29,240 --> 01:37:29,660
Conrad.

2868
01:37:34,480 --> 01:37:36,320
How bad is the storm?

2869
01:37:36,640 --> 01:37:40,360
Hey, just requesting any information about this storm you can give us?

2870
01:37:41,320 --> 01:37:42,700
Why do you like this?

2871
01:37:42,700 --> 01:37:43,900
Why do you like this?

2872
01:37:44,640 --> 01:37:46,420
Big storm coming in from the east.

2873
01:37:46,640 --> 01:37:48,240
I know, I'm just talking to you, man.

2874
01:37:48,380 --> 01:37:49,680
Master your coordinates within an hour.

2875
01:37:50,700 --> 01:37:51,140
Uh...

2876
01:37:51,140 --> 01:37:53,060
Should I provoke them, you guys?

2877
01:37:53,180 --> 01:37:54,280
Or what should I do?

2878
01:37:55,920 --> 01:37:57,500
I literally was compliant.

2879
01:37:59,320 --> 01:37:59,840
I'm not.

2880
01:38:05,540 --> 01:38:07,200
Okay, my discord is here.

2881
01:38:07,300 --> 01:38:09,260
We can handle a couple of buffs and drops of rain.

2882
01:38:09,860 --> 01:38:10,860
Thanks for the info.

2883
01:38:11,040 --> 01:38:13,380
We'll see you for drinks back on shore in a couple of days.

2884
01:38:14,920 --> 01:38:16,200
Look, I'm being compliant.

2885
01:38:16,580 --> 01:38:17,200
I listen.

2886
01:38:17,460 --> 01:38:18,320
Look, he's being a little baby.

2887
01:38:19,940 --> 01:38:21,620
What the fuck are you doing down there?

2888
01:38:21,780 --> 01:38:24,740
Why are you fucking trying to make sure we don't die?

2889
01:38:24,980 --> 01:38:26,060
And you're on your pee.

2890
01:38:26,220 --> 01:38:26,560
Where are you?

2891
01:38:26,680 --> 01:38:29,800
You're antagonizing the fucking other pirates.

2892
01:38:30,100 --> 01:38:30,300
Oh.

2893
01:38:30,700 --> 01:38:31,140
Oh.

2894
01:38:31,520 --> 01:38:32,240
Oh my god.

2895
01:38:33,120 --> 01:38:34,240
Quick time event.

2896
01:38:34,540 --> 01:38:35,140
Quick time.

2897
01:38:35,280 --> 01:38:35,460
Oh.

2898
01:38:35,620 --> 01:38:36,040
Oh.

2899
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:36,460
Whoa.

2900
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:40,400
I got both of mine.

2901
01:38:40,500 --> 01:38:40,700
Did you?

2902
01:38:40,840 --> 01:38:41,560
I got mine too.

2903
01:38:42,380 --> 01:38:42,820
Okay.

2904
01:38:42,900 --> 01:38:43,340
Alright.

2905
01:38:43,580 --> 01:38:44,400
I doubt it.

2906
01:38:46,760 --> 01:38:47,640
The water...

2907
01:38:47,640 --> 01:38:52,400
At least you're downstairs.

2908
01:38:52,520 --> 01:38:53,440
I'm upstairs.

2909
01:38:53,980 --> 01:38:54,420
What?

2910
01:38:54,720 --> 01:38:56,180
Our ship is flooding.

2911
01:38:56,180 --> 01:38:57,080
We're gonna drown.

2912
01:38:58,180 --> 01:38:58,620
Wait.

2913
01:38:58,680 --> 01:38:59,280
What's going on?

2914
01:38:59,820 --> 01:39:01,060
The ship is flooding.

2915
01:39:01,640 --> 01:39:02,360
Oh my god.

2916
01:39:02,520 --> 01:39:02,940
Oh my god.

2917
01:39:02,940 --> 01:39:03,440
There you guys are.

2918
01:39:03,980 --> 01:39:04,760
We're drowning.

2919
01:39:04,960 --> 01:39:05,640
We're drowning.

2920
01:39:05,720 --> 01:39:06,180
We're drowning.

2921
01:39:06,260 --> 01:39:07,240
I'm gonna hold on.

2922
01:39:07,540 --> 01:39:10,040
I'm gonna rescue Brad instead.

2923
01:39:11,920 --> 01:39:12,960
Get out of here, Brad.

2924
01:39:13,040 --> 01:39:13,540
Get out of here.

2925
01:39:13,700 --> 01:39:14,760
I hope you guys are okay.

2926
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:16,440
Because I had a choice to save.

2927
01:39:16,440 --> 01:39:17,500
But I chose not to.

2928
01:39:19,540 --> 01:39:20,120
Hey.

2929
01:39:21,120 --> 01:39:21,920
Move it.

2930
01:39:22,720 --> 01:39:23,840
We're gonna drown.

2931
01:39:25,760 --> 01:39:26,780
Oh my god.

2932
01:39:27,420 --> 01:39:29,480
Why was there so much water in there?

2933
01:39:29,800 --> 01:39:31,340
Because we're in the ocean.

2934
01:39:32,140 --> 01:39:34,820
The water's not supposed to go in the boat.

2935
01:39:36,210 --> 01:39:37,600
I had to help Brad.

2936
01:39:37,960 --> 01:39:37,980
Good job looking after number one.

2937
01:39:38,340 --> 01:39:39,200
Real smooth.

2938
01:39:39,860 --> 01:39:41,400
Great leadership, Fliss.

2939
01:39:42,100 --> 01:39:44,060
What did I do?

2940
01:39:44,280 --> 01:39:46,300
I literally saved us by...

2941
01:39:47,800 --> 01:39:49,200
Brad can't help himself.

2942
01:39:49,320 --> 01:39:50,140
He's a little baby.

2943
01:39:50,720 --> 01:39:51,460
Uh-oh.

2944
01:39:51,520 --> 01:39:52,120
Uh-oh.

2945
01:39:52,320 --> 01:39:53,680
What the fuck is that?

2946
01:39:53,720 --> 01:39:53,740
Oh my god.

2947
01:39:53,740 --> 01:39:54,600
We found the ship.

2948
01:39:54,700 --> 01:39:55,500
Oh my god.

2949
01:39:55,520 --> 01:39:56,180
We found Madonne.

2950
01:39:57,340 --> 01:39:57,780
Yeah.

2951
01:39:59,340 --> 01:40:00,220
There's Madonne.

2952
01:40:01,200 --> 01:40:01,940
There it is.

2953
01:40:01,940 --> 01:40:02,400
Oh my god.

2954
01:40:02,440 --> 01:40:02,900
Get in there.

2955
01:40:08,960 --> 01:40:09,840
There's Madonne.

2956
01:40:11,440 --> 01:40:12,240
The man.

2957
01:40:12,280 --> 01:40:13,540
That was the man of him.

2958
01:40:13,700 --> 01:40:14,040
Yeah.

2959
01:40:14,220 --> 01:40:14,880
That's the man.

2960
01:40:14,880 --> 01:40:16,500
The man of the Madonne.

2961
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:20,640
Oh my god.

2962
01:40:20,660 --> 01:40:20,840
Wait.

2963
01:40:20,860 --> 01:40:21,740
That wasn't Conrad.

2964
01:40:21,820 --> 01:40:22,480
You don't think, right?

2965
01:40:22,760 --> 01:40:23,620
No, because...

2966
01:40:25,040 --> 01:40:26,280
No, we saved him.

2967
01:40:26,540 --> 01:40:27,440
Did we save him?

2968
01:40:28,400 --> 01:40:28,840
Yeah.

2969
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:29,840
We did it.

2970
01:40:32,320 --> 01:40:33,340
We did it.

2971
01:40:34,060 --> 01:40:36,000
We're keeping people alive.

2972
01:40:42,360 --> 01:40:44,380
I think he's disappointed in us.

2973
01:40:44,880 --> 01:40:46,280
I think he wanted Conrad to die.

2974
01:40:49,920 --> 01:40:52,600
What do you mean?

2975
01:40:52,760 --> 01:40:53,240
Yeah.

2976
01:40:53,280 --> 01:40:54,380
I saved some... Yeah.

2977
01:40:55,620 --> 01:40:57,600
I would have done it too if it wasn't you.

2978
01:40:57,600 --> 01:40:58,000
Yeah.

2979
01:40:58,000 --> 01:40:58,940
It was a QuickTime event.

2980
01:40:59,020 --> 01:40:59,940
I don't think you would have.

2981
01:41:00,300 --> 01:41:02,380
I did all my QuickTime events.

2982
01:41:03,740 --> 01:41:04,760
Most of them.

2983
01:41:05,600 --> 01:41:11,460
The kind-hearted creature I am, I'd like to offer you some forewarning of what's to come.

2984
01:41:11,500 --> 01:41:12,180
Do you want to see it?

2985
01:41:12,380 --> 01:41:12,860
Ooh.

2986
01:41:12,920 --> 01:41:13,280
Tempted?

2987
01:41:15,100 --> 01:41:15,660
Ooh.

2988
01:41:16,280 --> 01:41:16,840
Ooh.

2989
01:41:16,860 --> 01:41:17,240
We can decide.

2990
01:41:17,720 --> 01:41:18,280
Wait.

2991
01:41:18,720 --> 01:41:20,140
Do you want to know or not?

2992
01:41:20,300 --> 01:41:20,880
I want to know.

2993
01:41:20,960 --> 01:41:21,460
How do you...

2994
01:41:21,460 --> 01:41:21,620
Okay.

2995
01:41:21,620 --> 01:41:22,300
Let's know.

2996
01:41:22,640 --> 01:41:23,200
Curious?

2997
01:41:23,300 --> 01:41:24,100
I got to make the decision.

2998
01:41:24,260 --> 01:41:24,460
Yeah.

2999
01:41:24,520 --> 01:41:25,320
You're in agreement.

3000
01:41:26,200 --> 01:41:27,620
Clue it is.

3001
01:41:27,660 --> 01:41:28,180
Yeah.

3002
01:41:28,440 --> 01:41:29,360
Clue it is.

3003
01:41:29,360 --> 01:41:32,320
The merchant of Venice, Act 2, Scene 7.

3004
01:41:32,420 --> 01:41:41,120
The Prince of Morocco pulls a scroll from the eye of a skull and reads, All that glisters is not gold.

3005
01:41:41,140 --> 01:41:41,540
Glisters?

3006
01:41:42,080 --> 01:41:44,180
Often have you heard that told.

3007
01:41:44,180 --> 01:41:45,220
What the fuck does that mean?

3008
01:41:45,660 --> 01:41:46,220
I don't...

3009
01:41:47,200 --> 01:41:47,780
What?

3010
01:41:47,880 --> 01:41:48,300
What?

3011
01:41:48,600 --> 01:41:49,460
That was a hint.

3012
01:41:49,760 --> 01:41:50,540
That was a hint.

3013
01:41:51,240 --> 01:41:52,580
That's not even a bit.

3014
01:41:52,600 --> 01:41:53,600
It's barely a riddle.

3015
01:41:55,600 --> 01:41:56,180
What?

3016
01:41:56,700 --> 01:41:57,020
What?

3017
01:41:58,660 --> 01:42:00,540
Everything may not be entirely as it seems.

3018
01:42:00,540 --> 01:42:01,940
He quoted Smash Mouth.

3019
01:42:02,680 --> 01:42:05,420
All that glisters is gold.

3020
01:42:09,200 --> 01:42:10,980
Probably shouldn't have said that.

3021
01:42:12,860 --> 01:42:14,380
Oh, don't be greedy.

3022
01:42:14,720 --> 01:42:15,680
I meant don't be greedy.

3023
01:42:16,740 --> 01:42:17,540
I'm not.

3024
01:42:17,840 --> 01:42:18,920
You is you.

3025
01:42:19,120 --> 01:42:20,280
Don't you get the tablet?

3026
01:42:21,920 --> 01:42:23,380
I had to to progress.

3027
01:42:24,620 --> 01:42:25,340
I think.

3028
01:42:25,460 --> 01:42:26,220
Oh yeah, I did.

3029
01:42:26,360 --> 01:42:27,460
You're Julia now.

3030
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:28,700
Oh no.

3031
01:42:29,180 --> 01:42:30,240
You're Fliss.

3032
01:42:30,580 --> 01:42:31,640
Oh, I'm Fliss now.

3033
01:42:31,840 --> 01:42:33,200
Okay, this is my first time being Fliss.

3034
01:42:33,420 --> 01:42:34,780
Oh no, now I'm Julia.

3035
01:42:34,940 --> 01:42:36,800
Now to fix the relationship you've ruined.

3036
01:42:37,300 --> 01:42:37,620
Yeah.

3037
01:42:37,820 --> 01:42:38,320
Yeah.

3038
01:42:39,900 --> 01:42:40,400
Yeah.

3039
01:42:40,400 --> 01:42:47,520
Like I said, if they were truly happy for those seven years, my little tiny decisions did nothing.

3040
01:42:49,560 --> 01:42:53,160
But how many tiny decisions did you make?

3041
01:42:53,520 --> 01:42:54,320
There was like...

3042
01:42:58,120 --> 01:42:59,200
No decisions.

3043
01:42:59,440 --> 01:43:01,540
Why are we going to the... that ship?

3044
01:43:01,680 --> 01:43:03,560
Why can't we stay in our little ship?

3045
01:43:04,040 --> 01:43:04,680
What is that?

3046
01:43:04,860 --> 01:43:05,320
Oh, what they found?

3047
01:43:05,320 --> 01:43:06,300
It's a dynamite, isn't it?

3048
01:43:07,460 --> 01:43:08,000
What?

3049
01:43:08,080 --> 01:43:08,940
I don't think so.

3050
01:43:09,080 --> 01:43:09,640
What was that?

3051
01:43:10,820 --> 01:43:13,000
Why did they suddenly decide to search in there?

3052
01:43:13,360 --> 01:43:14,400
I know, that's what I'm saying.

3053
01:43:14,500 --> 01:43:16,240
Why can't we just stay in our tiny ship?

3054
01:43:18,020 --> 01:43:19,220
Oh, it's an engine part.

3055
01:43:19,480 --> 01:43:19,640
Oh.

3056
01:43:22,580 --> 01:43:24,040
Oh, apparently it was sinking.

3057
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:26,680
What the hell is wrong with you?

3058
01:43:29,160 --> 01:43:30,340
Yeah, that's what I said.

3059
01:43:30,420 --> 01:43:32,640
And you were like, we're in the ocean.

3060
01:43:33,220 --> 01:43:35,160
How was I supposed to know we were sinking?

3061
01:43:35,240 --> 01:43:36,740
I thought just water got in.

3062
01:43:38,680 --> 01:43:39,540
Oh my god.

3063
01:43:41,660 --> 01:43:42,460
Yeah, we're Ollie.

3064
01:43:42,880 --> 01:43:44,120
We're all gonna die in here.

3065
01:43:44,420 --> 01:43:46,000
Yeah, we're gonna die in the ship of Madon.

3066
01:43:46,180 --> 01:43:48,540
But we know Brad would live in the bathroom here.

3067
01:43:50,120 --> 01:43:52,920
No, that was the bathroom of the other boat.

3068
01:43:53,240 --> 01:43:54,840
No, it was the bathroom of this boat.

3069
01:43:55,820 --> 01:43:56,820
No, I don't think so.

3070
01:43:58,400 --> 01:43:58,800
Right?

3071
01:43:59,240 --> 01:44:00,080
It was blue.

3072
01:44:00,220 --> 01:44:01,180
The ship is blue.

3073
01:44:01,780 --> 01:44:04,080
It was... Oh, we're walking now.

3074
01:44:04,280 --> 01:44:04,720
Oh, we are.

3075
01:44:04,840 --> 01:44:05,820
I was gonna say stay here.

3076
01:44:07,700 --> 01:44:09,440
Hey, remember you can walk faster.

3077
01:44:09,680 --> 01:44:10,080
LB.

3078
01:44:10,400 --> 01:44:12,440
Oh, LB, LB.

3079
01:44:12,520 --> 01:44:12,900
LB.

3080
01:44:13,160 --> 01:44:14,340
I'm walking, I'm walking.

3081
01:44:14,340 --> 01:44:15,260
I'm walking here.

3082
01:44:15,460 --> 01:44:16,300
I'm walking here.

3083
01:44:17,460 --> 01:44:18,360
I got a thing.

3084
01:44:19,300 --> 01:44:20,100
What is this?

3085
01:44:20,520 --> 01:44:21,320
Guard duty.

3086
01:44:21,400 --> 01:44:22,400
Oh, he's watching me.

3087
01:44:22,440 --> 01:44:23,140
He's watching you?

3088
01:44:23,300 --> 01:44:23,600
Hey!

3089
01:44:23,660 --> 01:44:24,800
I was reading that!

3090
01:44:24,920 --> 01:44:26,080
Yeah, stop reading!

3091
01:44:26,740 --> 01:44:27,800
This guy sucks.

3092
01:44:28,240 --> 01:44:29,700
You're supposed to be walking!

3093
01:44:30,100 --> 01:44:30,780
I'm walking.

3094
01:44:30,780 --> 01:44:31,080
Be careful.

3095
01:44:31,080 --> 01:44:32,060
I'm doing my job.

3096
01:44:32,500 --> 01:44:33,980
I'm gonna get tetanus.

3097
01:44:35,320 --> 01:44:36,760
Oh, who are you walking into?

3098
01:44:36,960 --> 01:44:37,780
Oh, I walk...

3099
01:44:38,220 --> 01:44:38,700
Oh, oh.

3100
01:44:38,700 --> 01:44:39,740
Oh, he pushed me too.

3101
01:44:41,220 --> 01:44:42,020
Is this...

3102
01:44:42,020 --> 01:44:43,680
Okay, my bad, my bad, my bad.

3103
01:44:44,040 --> 01:44:45,360
We're walking, we're walking.

3104
01:44:45,920 --> 01:44:47,600
Apparently we can't even walk right.

3105
01:44:51,680 --> 01:44:52,460
Here we go.

3106
01:44:52,580 --> 01:44:52,740
Oh!

3107
01:44:53,420 --> 01:44:54,780
Oh no, your little bracelet!

3108
01:44:55,040 --> 01:44:55,320
Oh my god, no.

3109
01:44:55,400 --> 01:44:56,480
No, my bracelet!

3110
01:44:56,620 --> 01:44:57,900
That's like $100,000.

3111
01:44:58,160 --> 01:44:58,480
Oh, your bracelet.

3112
01:44:58,480 --> 01:44:59,400
Daddy bought it for me.

3113
01:45:00,260 --> 01:45:00,660
Here we go.

3114
01:45:01,340 --> 01:45:02,140
Real gold.

3115
01:45:02,360 --> 01:45:03,460
Yeah, I got it from...

3116
01:45:03,460 --> 01:45:04,220
What's wrong with your head?

3117
01:45:06,340 --> 01:45:06,740
Ah!

3118
01:45:06,740 --> 01:45:08,300
Oh, that's a dead body.

3119
01:45:11,020 --> 01:45:12,120
Am I able to walk?

3120
01:45:12,280 --> 01:45:13,000
Am I walking?

3121
01:45:13,120 --> 01:45:14,260
Oh wait, oh wait, oh yeah, we're walking.

3122
01:45:14,420 --> 01:45:15,200
Oh, I got pushed back.

3123
01:45:15,240 --> 01:45:16,200
Sorry, I walked the wrong way.

3124
01:45:17,480 --> 01:45:18,620
You look a little worried.

3125
01:45:18,700 --> 01:45:19,100
What's wrong?

3126
01:45:19,300 --> 01:45:19,560
What's wrong?

3127
01:45:20,060 --> 01:45:21,140
Where do we go?

3128
01:45:21,220 --> 01:45:21,760
Where do we go?

3129
01:45:21,860 --> 01:45:23,320
Oh, Scooby, where do we go?

3130
01:45:23,320 --> 01:45:23,820
Where do we go?

3131
01:45:23,920 --> 01:45:26,280
Oh gosh, Shaggy, I don't know...

3132
01:45:26,280 --> 01:45:26,940
Oh gosh!

3133
01:45:29,040 --> 01:45:31,300
I don't know about this, Shaggy.

3134
01:45:31,560 --> 01:45:31,940
Let's go.

3135
01:45:33,260 --> 01:45:35,620
Rocky, I don't know about this, Rocky.

3136
01:45:36,140 --> 01:45:36,520
Oh, I'm so scared.

3137
01:45:36,520 --> 01:45:36,720
I'm so scared.

3138
01:45:36,720 --> 01:45:37,560
Oh, wait.

3139
01:45:38,600 --> 01:45:39,480
Wait, what is that?

3140
01:45:39,540 --> 01:45:39,760
What is that?

3141
01:45:39,760 --> 01:45:40,400
I can't even move.

3142
01:45:40,440 --> 01:45:42,020
I want to see what the poster says.

3143
01:45:42,280 --> 01:45:43,880
The Mask of Madness.

3144
01:45:43,900 --> 01:45:44,400
The Mask?

3145
01:45:44,400 --> 01:45:49,700
If you dare to look death in the eye, now showing in the mess hall.

3146
01:45:49,980 --> 01:45:50,120
Whoa!

3147
01:45:50,720 --> 01:45:51,260
Are you...

3148
01:45:51,260 --> 01:45:52,220
Do you see what I'm seeing?

3149
01:45:52,360 --> 01:45:53,640
I'm in the dormitories.

3150
01:45:54,500 --> 01:45:55,300
What are you seeing?

3151
01:45:55,600 --> 01:45:56,380
I don't know.

3152
01:45:56,520 --> 01:45:57,340
I'm just walking.

3153
01:45:57,580 --> 01:45:58,360
Oh, I can see...

3154
01:45:58,360 --> 01:45:59,240
There's an item here.

3155
01:46:00,080 --> 01:46:00,500
Grab it?

3156
01:46:00,500 --> 01:46:01,160
What are they gonna do with us?

3157
01:46:02,780 --> 01:46:03,700
Oh, there's Miller.

3158
01:46:03,860 --> 01:46:04,120
What?

3159
01:46:04,120 --> 01:46:04,260
Miller.

3160
01:46:05,240 --> 01:46:06,660
Why are they like not...

3161
01:46:06,660 --> 01:46:06,700
Why are they like not...

3162
01:46:06,700 --> 01:46:07,800
They're not supervising us anymore.

3163
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:08,340
I know.

3164
01:46:08,620 --> 01:46:09,680
Where are they?

3165
01:46:10,160 --> 01:46:11,440
Oh, I can also look at it.

3166
01:46:11,580 --> 01:46:11,920
What is it?

3167
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:12,760
It says Miller.

3168
01:46:13,680 --> 01:46:14,080
Miller.

3169
01:46:14,720 --> 01:46:15,840
I'm waiting for you here.

3170
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:16,940
I'm at the other side.

3171
01:46:17,500 --> 01:46:18,220
Okay, I'm coming.

3172
01:46:18,320 --> 01:46:18,520
I'm coming.

3173
01:46:19,380 --> 01:46:20,160
Master Miller?

3174
01:46:22,060 --> 01:46:24,120
Oh, there's Alex.

3175
01:46:26,180 --> 01:46:27,180
Oh, they're slow.

3176
01:46:27,320 --> 01:46:28,420
They're just as slow as we are.

3177
01:46:28,420 --> 01:46:29,680
I don't think LB works.

3178
01:46:29,700 --> 01:46:30,420
I'll be honest.

3179
01:46:30,620 --> 01:46:31,180
I don't feel any faster.

3180
01:46:31,180 --> 01:46:31,740
I don't think so, though.

3181
01:46:31,780 --> 01:46:32,980
I don't think it works either.

3182
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:34,360
Why is every...

3183
01:46:34,360 --> 01:46:36,180
Why is he moving like he's one of us?

3184
01:46:36,200 --> 01:46:36,680
Like he's...

3185
01:46:36,700 --> 01:46:37,480
He's moving like an MP.

3186
01:46:37,820 --> 01:46:39,060
Oh, there's rats.

3187
01:46:40,380 --> 01:46:40,820
Rats?

3188
01:46:41,740 --> 01:46:42,180
Rats?

3189
01:46:43,140 --> 01:46:43,580
Rats?

3190
01:46:43,620 --> 01:46:43,760
Rats?

3191
01:46:43,760 --> 01:46:44,100
Where's the...

3192
01:46:44,100 --> 01:46:45,080
Where's the rats, Roggy?

3193
01:46:45,080 --> 01:46:45,760
I didn't see any rats.

3194
01:46:45,940 --> 01:46:46,620
I didn't...

3195
01:46:46,620 --> 01:46:47,100
Oh, Roggy.

3196
01:46:47,100 --> 01:46:47,680
There's something over here.

3197
01:46:47,800 --> 01:46:48,000
Oh.

3198
01:46:48,380 --> 01:46:48,960
What's this?

3199
01:46:49,260 --> 01:46:49,860
What's this?

3200
01:46:50,160 --> 01:46:52,700
It's an internal memorandum.

3201
01:46:55,440 --> 01:46:57,000
This is gonna give us a hint?

3202
01:46:57,440 --> 01:46:59,720
You're covering Patterson's guard duties tomorrow.

3203
01:46:59,880 --> 01:47:00,520
He is sick again.

3204
01:47:00,840 --> 01:47:03,540
Conveniently, it's always when he has guard duties and hold 3A.

3205
01:47:03,920 --> 01:47:05,480
First is 24 o'clock.

3206
01:47:05,700 --> 01:47:06,680
Check the chart for...

3207
01:47:07,340 --> 01:47:07,700
Oh.

3208
01:47:07,880 --> 01:47:09,080
Oh, you found the secret.

3209
01:47:09,720 --> 01:47:10,720
Maybe that'll help us.

3210
01:47:11,180 --> 01:47:12,540
This is the third time this week.

3211
01:47:12,680 --> 01:47:13,720
None of us like it down there.

3212
01:47:13,780 --> 01:47:15,180
Maybe Patterson should buck up.

3213
01:47:16,180 --> 01:47:16,540
Get...

3214
01:47:16,540 --> 01:47:17,400
Just get on it.

3215
01:47:18,260 --> 01:47:18,620
Okay.

3216
01:47:19,300 --> 01:47:19,980
Maybe it'll...

3217
01:47:19,980 --> 01:47:21,580
Maybe it'll like help us.

3218
01:47:21,620 --> 01:47:21,900
Hello.

3219
01:47:22,960 --> 01:47:24,820
I wanna look at the secret, too.

3220
01:47:25,020 --> 01:47:25,860
Yeah, go look at the secret.

3221
01:47:26,220 --> 01:47:27,480
I wanna look at it.

3222
01:47:27,520 --> 01:47:28,720
How do I look at the secret?

3223
01:47:28,720 --> 01:47:30,280
It might be in the menu now, right?

3224
01:47:30,320 --> 01:47:30,620
No!

3225
01:47:31,020 --> 01:47:31,740
I think so.

3226
01:47:31,780 --> 01:47:34,180
Yeah, I think you got the secret, so I don't have to look at the secret.

3227
01:47:34,380 --> 01:47:36,200
That's two for two secrets for me.

3228
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:36,680
Okay.

3229
01:47:36,680 --> 01:47:38,200
So, let's go.

3230
01:47:38,200 --> 01:47:39,080
I'm gonna go see the secret.

3231
01:47:39,280 --> 01:47:39,720
Okay.

3232
01:47:40,100 --> 01:47:40,540
I'm gonna go check the secret.

3233
01:47:40,960 --> 01:47:41,600
I'm gonna go check the secret.

3234
01:47:41,600 --> 01:47:41,680
Okay.

3235
01:47:41,680 --> 01:47:42,460
There's lots of doors here.

3236
01:47:42,540 --> 01:47:42,660
Yeah.

3237
01:47:44,980 --> 01:47:46,360
Are they putting us in the brig?

3238
01:47:47,100 --> 01:47:49,160
Wait, this is where we were, isn't it?

3239
01:47:49,180 --> 01:47:50,960
When we were Konrad and...

3240
01:47:50,960 --> 01:47:52,460
No, we were never here.

3241
01:47:53,020 --> 01:47:54,420
I don't remember this area.

3242
01:47:55,620 --> 01:47:56,060
Oh!

3243
01:47:57,380 --> 01:47:58,300
We're locked in!

3244
01:47:58,500 --> 01:47:59,100
Oh my God.

3245
01:47:59,580 --> 01:48:00,020
Hey!

3246
01:48:00,560 --> 01:48:01,880
It's pitch black in here!

3247
01:48:02,460 --> 01:48:03,440
Give us the light.

3248
01:48:04,180 --> 01:48:05,780
Where did that light come from?

3249
01:48:05,880 --> 01:48:06,660
It doesn't look like it.

3250
01:48:06,660 --> 01:48:11,320
Oh, they gave us a flat... they're such nice pirates!

3251
01:48:11,480 --> 01:48:12,480
They're actually so nice!

3252
01:48:13,340 --> 01:48:15,180
See, their pirates aren't that bad.

3253
01:48:15,320 --> 01:48:17,220
I bet they weren't actually gonna shoot Conrad.

3254
01:48:20,080 --> 01:48:22,100
Wait, how do we have a lighter?

3255
01:48:23,060 --> 01:48:24,760
Gosh, I almost missed that.

3256
01:48:26,660 --> 01:48:28,420
My controller was like in my lap.

3257
01:48:30,780 --> 01:48:32,080
How is that still good?

3258
01:48:32,180 --> 01:48:33,420
Like, not waterlogged.

3259
01:48:33,420 --> 01:48:34,260
I know.

3260
01:48:34,460 --> 01:48:37,620
Wait, maybe because the ship never went into the ocean.

3261
01:48:51,280 --> 01:48:52,500
What's the ship's name?

3262
01:49:01,620 --> 01:49:02,740
What's the ship's name?

3263
01:49:03,580 --> 01:49:04,200
Oh, wow.

3264
01:49:04,260 --> 01:49:05,900
Your relationship with Alex went down!

3265
01:49:06,120 --> 01:49:07,300
How did it go down?

3266
01:49:07,340 --> 01:49:09,440
I literally just asked about the ship's name!

3267
01:49:09,620 --> 01:49:12,800
You're so... okay, what is this relationship we're trying to save, huh?

3268
01:49:15,240 --> 01:49:17,420
Wait for Brad... um...

3269
01:49:18,580 --> 01:49:19,620
We should just leave.

3270
01:49:19,840 --> 01:49:20,960
I didn't know that meant we...

3271
01:49:26,580 --> 01:49:27,820
Oh yeah, good luck.

3272
01:49:29,980 --> 01:49:31,580
How would the radio still be working?

3273
01:49:31,760 --> 01:49:32,680
I know, right?

3274
01:49:33,420 --> 01:49:35,340
It's been like, out of commission for so long.

3275
01:49:41,880 --> 01:49:43,280
Wait, but I thought it was sinking!

3276
01:49:43,560 --> 01:49:44,800
If it was sinking, then...

3277
01:49:44,800 --> 01:49:47,380
How is the ship gonna be still there?

3278
01:49:48,840 --> 01:49:49,520
Yeah, exactly.

3279
01:49:50,780 --> 01:49:51,840
I don't think it was sinking.

3280
01:49:52,640 --> 01:49:53,320
I don't think so.

3281
01:49:53,440 --> 01:49:54,700
You told me it was sinking!

3282
01:49:54,860 --> 01:49:55,940
That's why I agreed with you!

3283
01:49:59,440 --> 01:50:01,580
You're the one that told me it was sinking!

3284
01:50:03,420 --> 01:50:04,060
No, you said it first!

3285
01:50:04,340 --> 01:50:04,860
I didn't!

3286
01:50:04,900 --> 01:50:09,040
I was like, why don't we just take the ship and you're like, no, it's sinking, Toki!

3287
01:50:09,520 --> 01:50:10,200
No, we're working with these guys.

3288
01:50:10,540 --> 01:50:10,900
Whatever.

3289
01:50:11,600 --> 01:50:14,400
But I... I mean, obviously that's not true.

3290
01:50:14,500 --> 01:50:15,600
They're being just as bad to you as they are to us.

3291
01:50:15,600 --> 01:50:16,320
No, it was water.

3292
01:50:16,420 --> 01:50:17,060
We were drowning.

3293
01:50:17,900 --> 01:50:19,180
There's water everywhere!

3294
01:50:21,060 --> 01:50:22,840
Just get a fucking bucket!

3295
01:50:23,320 --> 01:50:25,960
Oh my god, it was Julius who was just like, we're gonna drown!

3296
01:50:27,520 --> 01:50:29,140
Oh, hey, we apologized to each other.

3297
01:50:30,080 --> 01:50:30,440
Cool.

3298
01:50:30,720 --> 01:50:32,980
After we were arguing with each other, they apologized.

3299
01:50:32,980 --> 01:50:33,440
I know.

3300
01:50:35,460 --> 01:50:37,020
We did our job.

3301
01:50:38,100 --> 01:50:39,100
Secured a room.

3302
01:50:39,420 --> 01:50:40,760
Oh, I got something here too.

3303
01:50:41,360 --> 01:50:42,120
What's happening?

3304
01:50:42,220 --> 01:50:43,540
I don't know, we were too busy arguing.

3305
01:50:44,040 --> 01:50:44,360
I know.

3306
01:50:45,740 --> 01:50:46,180
Okay.

3307
01:50:46,440 --> 01:50:46,600
Okay.

3308
01:50:47,640 --> 01:50:48,120
What's this?

3309
01:50:48,200 --> 01:50:48,920
Oh, I found a secret.

3310
01:50:49,100 --> 01:50:50,180
Hey, baby doll.

3311
01:50:50,520 --> 01:50:51,940
I miss you like crazy.

3312
01:50:52,180 --> 01:50:55,680
Three months until my next leave and jumping into your arms.

3313
01:50:55,880 --> 01:50:56,640
Three months.

3314
01:50:56,840 --> 01:50:58,820
I've been on the shore leave with these guys.

3315
01:50:58,960 --> 01:51:02,820
Had a few beers, but don't worry, I'm keeping everything ready for you.

3316
01:51:02,820 --> 01:51:04,420
If you catch my drift.

3317
01:51:05,420 --> 01:51:06,040
How's work?

3318
01:51:06,240 --> 01:51:08,220
I hope that boss of yours is leaving you alone.

3319
01:51:08,600 --> 01:51:14,120
I know you can take care of yourself, but I feel helpless being so far away and I want to keep you safe.

3320
01:51:14,680 --> 01:51:15,120
Skydive.

3321
01:51:17,150 --> 01:51:20,350
I got a lot of time to think while I'm guarding the cargo holds.

3322
01:51:20,590 --> 01:51:22,330
It's dark and spooky down there.

3323
01:51:22,530 --> 01:51:27,670
Some of the other guys have seen a figure roaming around, but I've always got you with me to keep me safe too.

3324
01:51:27,970 --> 01:51:30,930
I'll be with you soon and get a job as a mechanic.

3325
01:51:31,150 --> 01:51:33,490
And we can get married and have two children.

3326
01:51:33,670 --> 01:51:34,170
We'll be happy.

3327
01:51:34,170 --> 01:51:34,730
Happy together.

3328
01:51:34,930 --> 01:51:35,310
Forever.

3329
01:51:35,730 --> 01:51:37,530
Love you so much, Miller.

3330
01:51:38,110 --> 01:51:39,030
Oh my god!

3331
01:51:39,690 --> 01:51:41,670
Look at the picture on the wall!

3332
01:51:42,170 --> 01:51:43,350
Look at the picture on the wall!

3333
01:51:43,650 --> 01:51:44,450
What picture?

3334
01:51:44,690 --> 01:51:45,190
This one.

3335
01:51:45,650 --> 01:51:46,270
This one.

3336
01:51:46,370 --> 01:51:46,610
Right here.

3337
01:51:46,690 --> 01:51:46,830
Right here.

3338
01:51:46,830 --> 01:51:47,390
Oh, okay.

3339
01:51:47,450 --> 01:51:48,690
Is that gonna give us a secret?

3340
01:51:49,170 --> 01:51:49,650
Yeah.

3341
01:51:50,170 --> 01:51:50,650
Alright.

3342
01:51:50,830 --> 01:51:53,850
And like look at it and then like look up.

3343
01:51:54,230 --> 01:51:55,370
Are you good?

3344
01:51:55,470 --> 01:51:56,370
I don't know.

3345
01:51:57,470 --> 01:51:58,330
What's wrong?

3346
01:51:59,170 --> 01:51:59,890
What's wrong?

3347
01:52:00,190 --> 01:52:00,850
I wonder what happened.

3348
01:52:01,110 --> 01:52:02,210
Alright, I'm looking up.

3349
01:52:03,130 --> 01:52:04,330
Wait, it won't let me look up.

3350
01:52:04,390 --> 01:52:04,830
What do you mean?

3351
01:52:05,070 --> 01:52:06,490
With the right analog.

3352
01:52:07,310 --> 01:52:08,110
It didn't let me.

3353
01:52:09,050 --> 01:52:09,410
What?

3354
01:52:09,570 --> 01:52:10,830
It didn't let me look up.

3355
01:52:11,310 --> 01:52:12,330
You missed the secret.

3356
01:52:12,670 --> 01:52:13,230
You missed the secret.

3357
01:52:13,230 --> 01:52:13,590
I missed the secret?

3358
01:52:13,710 --> 01:52:13,890
No!

3359
01:52:15,190 --> 01:52:15,550
No.

3360
01:52:16,110 --> 01:52:17,370
But I wanna look at that too.

3361
01:52:18,230 --> 01:52:18,590
Move!

3362
01:52:19,730 --> 01:52:21,250
I'm listening to the... Do you know French?

3363
01:52:22,810 --> 01:52:23,170
Yeah.

3364
01:52:25,290 --> 01:52:25,650
Oui?

3365
01:52:27,070 --> 01:52:30,090
He says, I don't have the tools to do as I say and that's all.

3366
01:52:30,510 --> 01:52:31,550
I'm live translating.

3367
01:52:31,550 --> 01:52:32,650
Fuck you.

3368
01:52:32,710 --> 01:52:33,970
I'm live translating for you.

3369
01:52:34,190 --> 01:52:34,970
Oh, okay.

3370
01:52:35,030 --> 01:52:35,250
Thanks.

3371
01:52:35,250 --> 01:52:36,050
Nothing asshole.

3372
01:52:37,450 --> 01:52:37,930
Stop.

3373
01:52:38,110 --> 01:52:38,810
Stop it.

3374
01:52:39,070 --> 01:52:40,170
Shut up, Junior.

3375
01:52:40,450 --> 01:52:42,650
You're sitting there watching the prisoners.

3376
01:52:44,310 --> 01:52:44,790
Prisoners?

3377
01:52:44,790 --> 01:52:46,090
This is a real Canadian moment.

3378
01:52:46,170 --> 01:52:46,890
Is that... Is this a prison?

3379
01:52:48,110 --> 01:52:49,690
Do you not have subtitles on?

3380
01:52:51,690 --> 01:52:53,550
You don't have subtitles on, do you?

3381
01:52:53,950 --> 01:52:54,750
No, I do.

3382
01:52:54,810 --> 01:52:55,510
I have them on.

3383
01:52:56,070 --> 01:52:56,550
What?

3384
01:52:56,610 --> 01:52:59,230
I can't you see the subtitles at the bottom?

3385
01:53:00,330 --> 01:53:02,590
Yeah, but what if you weren't looking at them?

3386
01:53:07,450 --> 01:53:09,530
I'm talking to the boyfriend.

3387
01:53:09,930 --> 01:53:10,290
I found a letter.

3388
01:53:10,610 --> 01:53:12,170
A really weird letter.

3389
01:53:12,570 --> 01:53:13,810
Some of the crew were really...

3390
01:53:13,810 --> 01:53:14,890
I'm still listening to these guys.

3391
01:53:15,750 --> 01:53:16,330
...wicked out.

3392
01:53:16,710 --> 01:53:17,470
By what?

3393
01:53:17,710 --> 01:53:21,090
The guy Miller who wrote it says he saw figures roaming around.

3394
01:53:21,750 --> 01:53:22,270
Figures?

3395
01:53:22,890 --> 01:53:25,850
Oh, I'm telling him... I'm telling Alex about the ghosts.

3396
01:53:26,150 --> 01:53:26,670
Like ghosts?

3397
01:53:27,070 --> 01:53:27,970
Oh, I'm gonna listen.

3398
01:53:27,970 --> 01:53:29,730
I saw the rest of the guys were just trying to scare me.

3399
01:53:30,750 --> 01:53:31,610
What the hell was that?

3400
01:53:32,610 --> 01:53:33,250
Hold on.

3401
01:53:33,270 --> 01:53:33,730
I'm stuck.

3402
01:53:35,030 --> 01:53:35,570
I'm stuck.

3403
01:53:35,650 --> 01:53:36,370
I can't get over there.

3404
01:53:36,450 --> 01:53:36,710
Hold on.

3405
01:53:37,610 --> 01:53:38,330
I see you.

3406
01:53:39,350 --> 01:53:39,810
Hold on.

3407
01:53:39,810 --> 01:53:40,430
Hold on.

3408
01:53:40,570 --> 01:53:42,530
Hold on.

3409
01:53:42,590 --> 01:53:43,550
I can't get over there.

3410
01:53:43,790 --> 01:53:44,870
How did you get over there?

3411
01:53:46,330 --> 01:53:47,050
I'm coming.

3412
01:53:48,090 --> 01:53:48,650
I'm coming.

3413
01:53:48,810 --> 01:53:49,050
LBLD.

3414
01:53:49,350 --> 01:53:50,230
I'm coming.

3415
01:53:50,610 --> 01:53:50,850
I'm coming.

3416
01:53:50,850 --> 01:53:51,550
About this whole shit.

3417
01:53:53,010 --> 01:53:54,030
I just wish I knew what...

3418
01:53:54,030 --> 01:53:55,590
Yeah, I wanna know what the fisherman's gonna be doing.

3419
01:53:56,150 --> 01:53:56,510
Yeah.

3420
01:53:56,510 --> 01:53:57,250
Oh, there you are.

3421
01:54:02,350 --> 01:54:05,110
Are they gonna let us go if they find all that gold?

3422
01:54:06,750 --> 01:54:08,790
And if they don't find any gold...

3423
01:54:09,490 --> 01:54:11,370
What the fuck happened?

3424
01:54:11,550 --> 01:54:12,470
What happened?

3425
01:54:14,370 --> 01:54:15,410
What happened?

3426
01:54:16,230 --> 01:54:18,210
Alex just disappeared on my screen.

3427
01:54:19,530 --> 01:54:21,650
What did you do, Alex?

3428
01:54:23,690 --> 01:54:24,750
What are you doing?

3429
01:54:24,850 --> 01:54:25,030
Oh, my God.

3430
01:54:34,910 --> 01:54:36,530
That is very hopeful.

3431
01:54:36,630 --> 01:54:38,710
Where the fuck is Brad in all of this?

3432
01:54:39,330 --> 01:54:40,710
He's in the room somewhere.

3433
01:54:41,630 --> 01:54:43,030
He's just existing.

3434
01:54:52,830 --> 01:54:55,690
Okay, in the end, we gotta make sure Julia survives.

3435
01:54:56,230 --> 01:54:56,670
Yeah.

3436
01:54:58,170 --> 01:54:59,490
There was some stuff over here.

3437
01:54:59,490 --> 01:55:00,610
There is one over here.

3438
01:55:00,770 --> 01:55:03,110
There is one over here.

3439
01:55:03,510 --> 01:55:04,250
I'm staring.

3440
01:55:05,430 --> 01:55:05,990
What's this?

3441
01:55:08,210 --> 01:55:09,290
You got it?

3442
01:55:09,430 --> 01:55:10,150
You got this.

3443
01:55:10,390 --> 01:55:11,770
Yeah, I know how to hold now.

3444
01:55:11,930 --> 01:55:12,390
I know.

3445
01:55:13,090 --> 01:55:14,030
I found a pen!

3446
01:55:14,250 --> 01:55:15,210
You're pushing me out of the way!

3447
01:55:17,650 --> 01:55:18,890
I did it.

3448
01:55:19,350 --> 01:55:20,610
I did it, Mint.

3449
01:55:20,910 --> 01:55:21,230
Nice.

3450
01:55:22,610 --> 01:55:23,490
Oh, what's this?

3451
01:55:23,930 --> 01:55:24,410
No!

3452
01:55:25,550 --> 01:55:26,590
I found it!

3453
01:55:27,750 --> 01:55:28,510
A way out.

3454
01:55:30,310 --> 01:55:31,530
That's the game we're playing.

3455
01:55:31,630 --> 01:55:32,230
A way out.

3456
01:55:32,230 --> 01:55:33,790
A way out.

3457
01:55:34,690 --> 01:55:35,730
How am I... oh, there.

3458
01:55:35,870 --> 01:55:37,630
Wait, what's this?

3459
01:55:39,670 --> 01:55:40,510
There's a newspaper.

3460
01:55:43,130 --> 01:55:44,930
Oh, secret found.

3461
01:55:45,310 --> 01:55:45,910
1947.

3462
01:55:47,590 --> 01:55:49,070
Archaeologists missing in Iraq.

3463
01:55:49,390 --> 01:55:53,270
24 British archaeologists have gone missing in the mountains of Iraq.

3464
01:55:53,470 --> 01:55:59,170
The Hudson expedition arrived in the kingdom in September last year with a starting goal unearthing.

3465
01:55:59,430 --> 01:56:00,170
And then...

3466
01:56:00,170 --> 01:56:03,410
Oh, this must be the thing we found in the cargo.

3467
01:56:03,810 --> 01:56:04,410
Yeah.

3468
01:56:04,650 --> 01:56:06,170
This could be the cargo thing.

3469
01:56:06,830 --> 01:56:08,770
That's why they're all possessed and...

3470
01:56:08,770 --> 01:56:09,110
Yeah.

3471
01:56:10,150 --> 01:56:11,010
They're cursed.

3472
01:56:11,090 --> 01:56:11,510
They're cursed.

3473
01:56:11,510 --> 01:56:12,630
This is cursed.

3474
01:56:13,830 --> 01:56:15,650
Is there anything else we missed in here?

3475
01:56:16,750 --> 01:56:17,630
Oh, what's this?

3476
01:56:18,430 --> 01:56:20,030
Oh my god, Bradley's scared as crap.

3477
01:56:20,030 --> 01:56:20,130
I found Glam.

3478
01:56:20,370 --> 01:56:22,230
Oh my god, there he is.

3479
01:56:22,430 --> 01:56:23,210
Right there.

3480
01:56:24,070 --> 01:56:26,190
Oh my god, he's scared me so bad.

3481
01:56:26,290 --> 01:56:27,810
He just doesn't do anything.

3482
01:56:27,970 --> 01:56:28,630
He's useless.

3483
01:56:28,910 --> 01:56:31,170
We know somebody that's not gonna survive.

3484
01:56:31,710 --> 01:56:32,130
We know somebody that's not gonna survive.

3485
01:56:32,130 --> 01:56:32,770
I can't get it open.

3486
01:56:33,690 --> 01:56:34,630
We can get it open.

3487
01:56:34,810 --> 01:56:36,450
We're not keeping Bradley alive, right?

3488
01:56:36,590 --> 01:56:37,650
No, Bradley can die.

3489
01:56:37,650 --> 01:56:38,910
Yeah, Brad's just gonna die.

3490
01:56:41,570 --> 01:56:42,690
Down with the nerd.

3491
01:56:43,890 --> 01:56:45,090
No nerds allowed.

3492
01:56:45,930 --> 01:56:46,950
We can get it open.

3493
01:56:47,250 --> 01:56:47,770
Freedom.

3494
01:56:49,610 --> 01:56:50,650
Oh, uh...

3495
01:56:50,650 --> 01:56:52,010
This is the way out.

3496
01:56:52,710 --> 01:56:53,230
Yeah.

3497
01:56:53,690 --> 01:56:54,950
This is the way out.

3498
01:56:55,210 --> 01:56:55,730
Yeah.

3499
01:56:56,310 --> 01:56:56,830
Yeah.

3500
01:56:57,050 --> 01:56:58,610
My excitement's going up.

3501
01:56:59,490 --> 01:57:02,090
Alright, I got this.

3502
01:57:03,070 --> 01:57:04,130
No, I got this.

3503
01:57:04,210 --> 01:57:04,670
Yeah.

3504
01:57:04,790 --> 01:57:06,050
Someone should create a distraction.

3505
01:57:07,010 --> 01:57:08,010
This is gonna be loud.

3506
01:57:09,410 --> 01:57:10,450
Alex relationships.

3507
01:57:10,450 --> 01:57:11,810
Oh, Julia goes up.

3508
01:57:12,790 --> 01:57:13,310
Oh.

3509
01:57:13,490 --> 01:57:14,790
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

3510
01:57:15,190 --> 01:57:16,750
Wait, wait, Fliss.

3511
01:57:16,850 --> 01:57:18,430
Yeah, you make a distraction.

3512
01:57:19,250 --> 01:57:21,630
Yeah, why don't you do the distraction?

3513
01:57:26,130 --> 01:57:27,150
I'm gonna distract.

3514
01:57:27,390 --> 01:57:27,890
Here I go.

3515
01:57:28,370 --> 01:57:30,370
I hope Fliss doesn't die.

3516
01:57:32,750 --> 01:57:35,650
Finally get away.

3517
01:57:38,210 --> 01:57:40,970
Oh, maybe I shouldn't let you distract.

3518
01:57:40,970 --> 01:57:43,850
Yeah, hey, all that stuff she said but double is gross.

3519
01:57:44,510 --> 01:57:45,990
And your mother's mother's too.

3520
01:57:46,690 --> 01:57:47,130
Whoa.

3521
01:57:47,790 --> 01:57:48,230
Whoa.

3522
01:57:48,310 --> 01:57:49,410
Don't talk about my mom.

3523
01:57:50,030 --> 01:57:50,830
Oh, are you...

3524
01:57:50,830 --> 01:57:52,130
I'm doing the quick time event.

3525
01:57:52,270 --> 01:57:54,130
Oh, thank God I'm doing the quick time event.

3526
01:57:55,490 --> 01:57:56,110
That's right.

3527
01:57:56,210 --> 01:57:57,590
Your mother's all sucking.

3528
01:57:57,770 --> 01:57:58,350
Let us out.

3529
01:58:00,070 --> 01:58:01,170
Yeah, your mother.

3530
01:58:01,450 --> 01:58:02,250
Yeah, dear.

3531
01:58:03,090 --> 01:58:03,530
Yeah.

3532
01:58:04,810 --> 01:58:05,650
Are they coming?

3533
01:58:07,390 --> 01:58:08,750
Why are you screaming?

3534
01:58:09,850 --> 01:58:10,950
Because they don't want them there.

3535
01:58:10,950 --> 01:58:12,370
They want to hear us doing the event.

3536
01:58:12,630 --> 01:58:13,890
We're already done, Fliss.

3537
01:58:13,930 --> 01:58:14,230
Shut up.

3538
01:58:14,650 --> 01:58:15,510
Fliss, come on.

3539
01:58:15,710 --> 01:58:16,330
What do you mean?

3540
01:58:17,030 --> 01:58:17,830
You're Fliss.

3541
01:58:22,170 --> 01:58:23,250
Wait, what's going on?

3542
01:58:23,890 --> 01:58:24,730
Come on, Fliss.

3543
01:58:24,890 --> 01:58:25,290
Fliss.

3544
01:58:25,710 --> 01:58:26,590
Fliss, come on.

3545
01:58:27,090 --> 01:58:27,670
There you go.

3546
01:58:27,730 --> 01:58:28,070
Nice.

3547
01:58:29,670 --> 01:58:31,130
God, I can't believe she's not wearing shoes.

3548
01:58:31,830 --> 01:58:32,650
What are you deciding?

3549
01:58:33,350 --> 01:58:33,930
Replace it.

3550
01:58:33,990 --> 01:58:34,370
Replace it.

3551
01:58:36,350 --> 01:58:37,570
Yeah, they'll never know.

3552
01:58:37,630 --> 01:58:38,530
They'll never know.

3553
01:58:38,990 --> 01:58:39,650
Oh, no.

3554
01:58:49,850 --> 01:58:53,030
Oh, my God.

3555
01:58:53,590 --> 01:58:55,810
We're gonna get separated at some point.

3556
01:58:55,890 --> 01:58:56,850
I feel like it, too.

3557
01:58:57,690 --> 01:58:58,770
Find a way off the ship.

3558
01:58:59,150 --> 01:58:59,870
We need to keep going.

3559
01:59:00,530 --> 01:59:01,190
Come on.

3560
01:59:02,190 --> 01:59:03,950
There's gotta be some stairs around here.

3561
01:59:04,150 --> 01:59:04,510
Okay.

3562
01:59:04,850 --> 01:59:05,290
Okay.

3563
01:59:07,030 --> 01:59:07,750
What's going on?

3564
01:59:07,750 --> 01:59:09,110
Wait, why am I holding the light?

3565
01:59:10,050 --> 01:59:10,930
Wait, who am I?

3566
01:59:10,930 --> 01:59:12,630
Wait, who are you?

3567
01:59:12,750 --> 01:59:14,430
You're always... wait, are you Alex?

3568
01:59:14,870 --> 01:59:15,590
I'm Alex.

3569
01:59:15,670 --> 01:59:15,910
I'm Alex.

3570
01:59:15,910 --> 01:59:16,070
Oh, you're Alex?

3571
01:59:16,450 --> 01:59:16,890
Oh, okay.

3572
01:59:17,090 --> 01:59:17,450
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3573
01:59:17,570 --> 01:59:20,010
Alright, now that we're... oh wait, there's something over here too.

3574
01:59:20,350 --> 01:59:21,410
There's stuff in here, yeah.

3575
01:59:21,650 --> 01:59:23,410
They're all leaving, but we gotta explain.

3576
01:59:24,050 --> 01:59:25,590
We're splitting up already, guys?

3577
01:59:25,810 --> 01:59:26,350
We're splitting up.

3578
01:59:27,130 --> 01:59:28,530
I found a piece of paper.

3579
01:59:28,730 --> 01:59:31,010
It's good to know that we're splitting up already.

3580
01:59:31,530 --> 01:59:34,530
I found the guard duty regulations.

3581
01:59:34,750 --> 01:59:36,370
I found the uniforms.

3582
01:59:38,330 --> 01:59:39,610
Wait, how do I... oh, there we go.

3583
01:59:39,610 --> 01:59:42,010
Guys, nobody is allowed into 3A.

3584
01:59:42,270 --> 01:59:42,630
Seriously.

3585
01:59:42,910 --> 01:59:45,490
Okay, guys, I'm coming back.

3586
01:59:45,730 --> 01:59:46,250
Where are you?

3587
01:59:47,070 --> 01:59:47,790
No alcohol.

3588
01:59:48,470 --> 01:59:49,470
Where are you, Mint?

3589
01:59:49,910 --> 01:59:51,550
Hold on, I'm right by the front door.

3590
01:59:51,570 --> 01:59:53,210
The door we just... here, look at me.

3591
01:59:53,270 --> 01:59:53,770
Turn around.

3592
01:59:53,990 --> 01:59:54,710
I'm turning around?

3593
01:59:55,930 --> 01:59:56,510
Where are you?

3594
01:59:57,270 --> 01:59:58,230
I'm right in front of you.

3595
01:59:59,990 --> 02:00:01,370
I already ran through that door.

3596
02:00:01,430 --> 02:00:02,110
There's nothing in there.

3597
02:00:02,210 --> 02:00:03,050
I already ran through that.

3598
02:00:03,290 --> 02:00:03,970
Oh, okay, okay.

3599
02:00:03,970 --> 02:00:04,450
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3600
02:00:05,190 --> 02:00:07,770
Hey, Mint, I think we're gonna get caught up by the pirates.

3601
02:00:08,370 --> 02:00:09,590
No, why are you looking at me?

3602
02:00:09,610 --> 02:00:10,450
Why are you looking down like that?

3603
02:00:10,670 --> 02:00:12,470
Oh, I'm sorry.

3604
02:00:12,670 --> 02:00:14,150
I'm trying to look at where I'm standing.

3605
02:00:15,090 --> 02:00:16,750
I'm the one with the lights.

3606
02:00:16,990 --> 02:00:17,950
Oh, there's another door.

3607
02:00:18,270 --> 02:00:19,330
I have a flashlight too.

3608
02:00:19,950 --> 02:00:21,830
But how do you have a... oh, wait, I found a map.

3609
02:00:22,170 --> 02:00:23,870
Why is the light flickering there?

3610
02:00:24,210 --> 02:00:25,090
Out of bounds.

3611
02:00:25,770 --> 02:00:26,490
What was that?

3612
02:00:27,150 --> 02:00:30,450
Okay, so, Cargo Hole 2 is out of bounds.

3613
02:00:31,410 --> 02:00:32,190
Oh, yeah.

3614
02:00:32,570 --> 02:00:34,850
Yeah, are you gonna remember... do you remember that?

3615
02:00:35,350 --> 02:00:37,010
Cargo Hole 2 is out of bounds.

3616
02:00:37,010 --> 02:00:39,450
Yeah, when are we gonna get to Cargo Hole 2?

3617
02:00:39,650 --> 02:00:40,250
Wait, where do we go?

3618
02:00:40,770 --> 02:00:42,310
Why was the light flashing over there?

3619
02:00:42,330 --> 02:00:43,450
Yeah, you first.

3620
02:00:44,130 --> 02:00:44,530
Here?

3621
02:00:44,610 --> 02:00:45,030
You first.

3622
02:00:45,170 --> 02:00:45,470
Oh.

3623
02:00:46,670 --> 02:00:47,690
What's going on in here?

3624
02:00:47,870 --> 02:00:48,450
What's going on?

3625
02:00:48,790 --> 02:00:50,110
We're already split up with this.

3626
02:00:50,190 --> 02:00:50,450
Do lights actually work?

3627
02:00:51,790 --> 02:00:52,410
Oh my god.

3628
02:00:53,050 --> 02:00:55,330
Oh, oh, wait, I'm in the bathroom.

3629
02:00:55,750 --> 02:00:56,750
I'm in the bathroom.

3630
02:00:57,110 --> 02:00:58,710
Oh, I found a light in the bathroom!

3631
02:00:59,430 --> 02:01:00,110
Ladies first.

3632
02:01:00,570 --> 02:01:01,070
All right.

3633
02:01:01,950 --> 02:01:02,950
It's reading time.

3634
02:01:03,910 --> 02:01:05,990
Dear Eyeless, I'm finally coming home.

3635
02:01:05,990 --> 02:01:06,850
This is it, darling.

3636
02:01:07,110 --> 02:01:10,790
One last trip across the Pacific and I'll be back to you and the girls.

3637
02:01:10,990 --> 02:01:12,610
I can't wait to see your faces.

3638
02:01:12,870 --> 02:01:14,850
Tell Ned and Nancy to get excited.

3639
02:01:15,030 --> 02:01:18,070
They're gonna see Daddy real soon and he's got gifts for y'all.

3640
02:01:18,250 --> 02:01:20,030
I'm sure glad to be back at sea.

3641
02:01:20,250 --> 02:01:24,950
It's hotter than an Oklahoma summer out there on the land and there's no escape from it.

3642
02:01:25,270 --> 02:01:28,870
I've been all right because I got your letters to keep me going.

3643
02:01:29,170 --> 02:01:35,970
They censored them, which is probably for the best, because sometimes the others steal them to read and I don't like them reading them.

3644
02:01:35,970 --> 02:01:36,510
I'm glad I'm reading our letters.

3645
02:01:36,730 --> 02:01:38,110
It really creeps me out.

3646
02:01:38,310 --> 02:01:41,550
It keeps telling me there's a little boy on board and it sounds like Ted.

3647
02:01:41,750 --> 02:01:41,970
What?

3648
02:01:42,690 --> 02:01:43,170
What?

3649
02:01:44,110 --> 02:01:45,070
Wait, don't eat.

3650
02:01:45,270 --> 02:01:46,290
Our feet are smelly.

3651
02:01:46,310 --> 02:01:47,210
Our feet are smelly.

3652
02:01:47,270 --> 02:01:48,750
Oh, oh, we gotta go.

3653
02:01:48,910 --> 02:01:49,830
We gotta go.

3654
02:01:50,070 --> 02:01:50,670
We gotta go.

3655
02:01:50,670 --> 02:01:50,690
We gotta go.

3656
02:01:50,690 --> 02:01:51,910
I didn't finish the reading and...

3657
02:01:51,910 --> 02:01:52,930
Oh, I didn't.

3658
02:01:52,950 --> 02:01:53,270
We gotta go.

3659
02:01:53,390 --> 02:01:53,990
We gotta go.

3660
02:01:53,990 --> 02:01:54,310
We gotta go.

3661
02:01:54,410 --> 02:01:55,710
I think that's the sign.

3662
02:01:55,870 --> 02:01:57,490
I think that's the sign.

3663
02:01:57,570 --> 02:01:58,270
We gotta go.

3664
02:02:00,290 --> 02:02:01,690
We gotta get out of here, man.

3665
02:02:01,690 --> 02:02:02,650
Guys, I think...

3666
02:02:02,650 --> 02:02:03,370
I think...

3667
02:02:03,370 --> 02:02:03,850
Roro.

3668
02:02:04,390 --> 02:02:04,870
Roro.

3669
02:02:04,870 --> 02:02:05,250
Roro.

3670
02:02:05,750 --> 02:02:06,150
Roro.

3671
02:02:06,450 --> 02:02:06,850
Scooby.

3672
02:02:07,230 --> 02:02:07,630
Scoob.

3673
02:02:07,850 --> 02:02:09,550
Where did they go?

3674
02:02:09,770 --> 02:02:10,430
I think...

3675
02:02:10,850 --> 02:02:11,610
Oh, this way.

3676
02:02:12,210 --> 02:02:17,950
I think the moment it starts getting smelly, that's when death is coming and we split up.

3677
02:02:18,530 --> 02:02:18,930
Yeah!

3678
02:02:18,930 --> 02:02:19,830
We split up with...

3679
02:02:19,830 --> 02:02:20,730
No, no, they're right here.

3680
02:02:20,790 --> 02:02:21,190
They're right here.

3681
02:02:22,550 --> 02:02:23,650
They're right in front of me.

3682
02:02:23,730 --> 02:02:24,550
They're right in front of me.

3683
02:02:24,590 --> 02:02:24,650
All right.

3684
02:02:24,750 --> 02:02:27,490
I like how we're the only ones with the flashlight and we're like back.

3685
02:02:27,650 --> 02:02:28,770
In the very back.

3686
02:02:29,210 --> 02:02:29,610
Yeah.

3687
02:02:30,990 --> 02:02:31,670
Oh, oh, oh.

3688
02:02:31,690 --> 02:02:31,970
Oh.

3689
02:02:32,990 --> 02:02:33,390
Oh.

3690
02:02:33,810 --> 02:02:34,210
Oh.

3691
02:02:34,310 --> 02:02:34,710
Oh.

3692
02:02:35,110 --> 02:02:37,790
There's a lot of people who are suspiciously nowhere to be found.

3693
02:02:38,030 --> 02:02:38,630
Oh, wait.

3694
02:02:38,710 --> 02:02:39,410
There's stuff here.

3695
02:02:39,590 --> 02:02:40,430
Yeah, there's something here.

3696
02:02:40,570 --> 02:02:41,030
Oh, what's that?

3697
02:02:41,170 --> 02:02:41,670
What is that?

3698
02:02:42,110 --> 02:02:43,190
Are you picking it?

3699
02:02:43,330 --> 02:02:43,570
Oh.

3700
02:02:43,910 --> 02:02:45,110
Are you picking it up?

3701
02:02:45,610 --> 02:02:47,610
I think it's a skull of a rat.

3702
02:02:48,130 --> 02:02:49,650
Oh, there's another thing here, too.

3703
02:02:49,990 --> 02:02:50,630
It's a rat.

3704
02:02:50,730 --> 02:02:54,990
So my chat was like, I sure love how all the letters are like, gosh, I'm happy to be alive.

3705
02:02:55,270 --> 02:02:55,990
Wait, what happened?

3706
02:02:56,830 --> 02:02:58,110
Oh, my God.

3707
02:02:58,210 --> 02:02:58,750
What happened?

3708
02:02:59,010 --> 02:03:01,190
I just got grabbed by a ghost hand.

3709
02:03:01,550 --> 02:03:01,810
What?

3710
02:03:01,810 --> 02:03:01,910
What?

3711
02:03:05,670 --> 02:03:08,570
Skipper has Kato'd the booze for this goddamn trip.

3712
02:03:08,770 --> 02:03:09,150
Okay.

3713
02:03:09,470 --> 02:03:10,430
None of this lore.

3714
02:03:12,070 --> 02:03:13,610
This lore is not interesting.

3715
02:03:13,730 --> 02:03:14,750
He's just talking about alcohol.

3716
02:03:19,190 --> 02:03:21,790
It has to be the sound effects, right?

3717
02:03:21,790 --> 02:03:24,330
Or is it the music that goes... I think I'm gonna... hold on.

3718
02:03:24,430 --> 02:03:26,470
I think it's the music.

3719
02:03:26,690 --> 02:03:28,150
No, it's so bad!

3720
02:03:28,430 --> 02:03:30,250
I think it's the music that's going down to 35.

3721
02:03:30,250 --> 02:03:33,230
You got the spooky... got the 35.

3722
02:03:33,530 --> 02:03:35,930
That must have been some spooky music.

3723
02:03:36,090 --> 02:03:37,170
It was so loud.

3724
02:03:39,290 --> 02:03:40,770
Oh my god.

3725
02:03:41,370 --> 02:03:42,970
Wait, how are you scared of ghosts?

3726
02:03:43,110 --> 02:03:44,330
You are a ghost.

3727
02:03:44,750 --> 02:03:46,210
I'm scared of jump scares.

3728
02:03:47,730 --> 02:03:50,350
Yeah, but it's just your neighbor grabbing your hand.

3729
02:03:50,730 --> 02:03:51,350
I don't know.

3730
02:03:51,790 --> 02:03:52,350
Look at our feet!

3731
02:03:52,410 --> 02:03:52,910
Look at our feet!

3732
02:03:53,010 --> 02:03:56,450
Wait, oh, I could grab... wait, okay, I wanna see what this jump scare is.

3733
02:03:56,970 --> 02:03:58,490
Oh yeah, yeah, you do the rat.

3734
02:03:58,590 --> 02:03:59,070
Do the rat.

3735
02:03:59,130 --> 02:03:59,690
I'll do the rat.

3736
02:04:00,390 --> 02:04:00,790
Oh.

3737
02:04:01,470 --> 02:04:01,870
Oh.

3738
02:04:02,890 --> 02:04:04,290
Oh, I'm looking at it.

3739
02:04:04,570 --> 02:04:05,190
I'm watching.

3740
02:04:05,390 --> 02:04:05,770
I'm watching.

3741
02:04:06,510 --> 02:04:07,530
Am I going crazy?

3742
02:04:08,510 --> 02:04:09,130
There's nothing.

3743
02:04:09,610 --> 02:04:10,590
You lied to me.

3744
02:04:10,630 --> 02:04:11,370
There was nothing there.

3745
02:04:12,090 --> 02:04:12,490
What?

3746
02:04:12,890 --> 02:04:13,770
You're going crazy.

3747
02:04:13,770 --> 02:04:15,090
You didn't take your meds.

3748
02:04:15,670 --> 02:04:16,970
I have smelly feet.

3749
02:04:17,130 --> 02:04:18,450
Okay, I have smelly feet.

3750
02:04:18,490 --> 02:04:19,210
It's not my fault.

3751
02:04:19,830 --> 02:04:20,850
It's not my fault!

3752
02:04:21,170 --> 02:04:21,770
It's not my fault!

3753
02:04:21,790 --> 02:04:23,330
Someone here was lying.

3754
02:04:24,470 --> 02:04:24,710
Uh -oh.

3755
02:04:24,950 --> 02:04:26,370
Oh, I found a picture frame.

3756
02:04:26,430 --> 02:04:27,230
I think this is a clue.

3757
02:04:27,490 --> 02:04:28,290
Is this a premonition?

3758
02:04:28,690 --> 02:04:29,090
Yeah.

3759
02:04:29,170 --> 02:04:29,550
Oh.

3760
02:04:30,050 --> 02:04:30,690
Uh-oh.

3761
02:04:30,730 --> 02:04:31,130
What?

3762
02:04:31,190 --> 02:04:31,450
Uh-oh.

3763
02:04:32,050 --> 02:04:32,810
What is it?

3764
02:04:32,950 --> 02:04:33,230
Um...

3765
02:04:34,010 --> 02:04:35,190
What is the premonition?

3766
02:04:35,590 --> 02:04:36,710
You might wanna look at that one.

3767
02:04:36,830 --> 02:04:37,090
Okay.

3768
02:04:37,810 --> 02:04:39,590
We gotta make sure nobody dies.

3769
02:04:41,010 --> 02:04:42,030
Yeah, I think...

3770
02:04:44,490 --> 02:04:44,890
Oh.

3771
02:04:46,010 --> 02:04:46,590
Uh-oh.

3772
02:04:47,170 --> 02:04:47,810
Uh-oh.

3773
02:04:47,930 --> 02:04:48,790
Uh-oh.

3774
02:04:48,930 --> 02:04:51,050
All right, we gotta make sure Alex doesn't die.

3775
02:04:53,470 --> 02:04:54,450
You're Alex.

3776
02:04:54,770 --> 02:04:56,390
It's in your hands.

3777
02:04:56,670 --> 02:04:58,770
It's in your hands.

3778
02:04:59,470 --> 02:05:00,190
It's in your hands.

3779
02:05:00,190 --> 02:05:00,870
No, I got no...

3780
02:05:00,870 --> 02:05:03,030
It already warned you how to save Alex.

3781
02:05:03,650 --> 02:05:05,710
I don't know what was going on there.

3782
02:05:08,810 --> 02:05:10,690
They already told you how to save.

3783
02:05:10,690 --> 02:05:11,930
Oh my god, Bradley doesn't have shoes either.

3784
02:05:12,070 --> 02:05:13,170
What's wrong with you guys?

3785
02:05:15,650 --> 02:05:17,390
Mint has to protect herself.

3786
02:05:17,550 --> 02:05:18,810
It's not my fault.

3787
02:05:20,170 --> 02:05:20,590
Hey.

3788
02:05:20,590 --> 02:05:23,590
Um, I'm dead, so that means I couldn't protect myself from the beginning.

3789
02:05:23,730 --> 02:05:24,410
Oh my god, the flashlight.

3790
02:05:24,670 --> 02:05:25,730
Turn down the flashlight.

3791
02:05:25,990 --> 02:05:26,690
Turn it off!

3792
02:05:27,310 --> 02:05:28,170
Turn it off!

3793
02:05:28,990 --> 02:05:29,410
Turn it off!

3794
02:05:29,410 --> 02:05:30,230
There's someone down there, all right.

3795
02:05:33,840 --> 02:05:35,560
I'm the loudest whisperer ever.

3796
02:05:36,140 --> 02:05:37,000
Just turn it off.

3797
02:05:37,020 --> 02:05:38,380
Why are you putting your hand over a flashlight?

3798
02:05:38,380 --> 02:05:39,300
Just turn it off.

3799
02:05:40,980 --> 02:05:41,940
Oh, there's the pirates.

3800
02:05:43,380 --> 02:05:44,720
Save the battery, man.

3801
02:05:47,200 --> 02:05:49,380
Could be those charging flashlights, you know?

3802
02:05:49,420 --> 02:05:49,780
The...

3803
02:05:49,780 --> 02:05:50,880
Wah-wah-wah.

3804
02:05:50,880 --> 02:05:51,520
Wah-wah-wah.

3805
02:05:52,840 --> 02:05:53,980
Wah-wah-wah.

3806
02:05:54,120 --> 02:05:55,120
The whirring ones.

3807
02:06:02,300 --> 02:06:03,700
Are we actually gonna get that?

3808
02:06:04,040 --> 02:06:04,900
Yeah, I'm sure.

3809
02:06:05,220 --> 02:06:07,200
Yeah, we gotta get that so we can leave, right?

3810
02:06:08,400 --> 02:06:09,140
Oh no.

3811
02:06:09,780 --> 02:06:10,120
Oh?

3812
02:06:12,560 --> 02:06:12,960
Oh?

3813
02:06:13,080 --> 02:06:13,300
Oh?

3814
02:06:13,620 --> 02:06:14,660
He's gonna break it.

3815
02:06:14,720 --> 02:06:16,240
He's gonna destroy it so nobody can use it.

3816
02:06:16,360 --> 02:06:16,780
Oh, nevermind.

3817
02:06:17,680 --> 02:06:18,300
What's he doing?

3818
02:06:19,320 --> 02:06:20,360
He grabbed a weapon.

3819
02:06:20,660 --> 02:06:22,040
He has a hammer, yeah.

3820
02:06:23,940 --> 02:06:24,340
Um...

3821
02:06:29,460 --> 02:06:30,700
I don't need you barking at me.

3822
02:06:33,460 --> 02:06:39,280
I swear to god, if I have to play Fliss because of that, I swear to god, man.

3823
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:43,320
I swear to fucking god.

3824
02:06:43,820 --> 02:06:45,060
Not the flare.

3825
02:06:45,420 --> 02:06:47,980
Well, she was the one who was like, I'm gonna go get it.

3826
02:06:48,080 --> 02:06:48,580
I'm gonna go.

3827
02:06:49,980 --> 02:06:50,420
Oh.

3828
02:06:50,580 --> 02:06:52,000
Oh, you're going back in.

3829
02:06:52,980 --> 02:06:54,000
Bradley's a hero now.

3830
02:06:54,020 --> 02:06:54,580
Brad, Brad, Brad.

3831
02:06:54,580 --> 02:06:55,020
Brad, Brad.

3832
02:06:56,760 --> 02:06:59,740
All right, who's gonna be Brad and who's gonna be Fliss?

3833
02:07:00,720 --> 02:07:01,100
Uh oh.

3834
02:07:01,840 --> 02:07:04,120
All right, if I'm getting Brad, I'm making sure he dies.

3835
02:07:04,300 --> 02:07:05,000
Just so you know.

3836
02:07:05,200 --> 02:07:06,620
Oh yeah, if I get Brad, I'll do the same.

3837
02:07:06,880 --> 02:07:10,620
Oh my god.

3838
02:07:11,120 --> 02:07:11,480
Um...

3839
02:07:12,680 --> 02:07:13,820
No, I won't warn Brad.

3840
02:07:14,280 --> 02:07:14,820
How do you do it?

3841
02:07:26,620 --> 02:07:27,800
Brad is the victim.

3842
02:07:29,800 --> 02:07:30,680
Oh my god.

3843
02:07:31,420 --> 02:07:32,120
07 Brad.

3844
02:07:32,280 --> 02:07:35,120
We were very clear that we don't want Brad anymore.

3845
02:07:38,460 --> 02:07:40,260
Brad has been voted off the island.

3846
02:07:40,460 --> 02:07:41,160
Oh my god.

3847
02:07:41,160 --> 02:07:42,240
Oh my god.

3848
02:07:42,240 --> 02:07:42,460
What?

3849
02:07:43,120 --> 02:07:43,980
Oh my god.

3850
02:07:44,040 --> 02:07:44,680
Oh my god.

3851
02:07:44,740 --> 02:07:45,140
Oh no.

3852
02:07:45,860 --> 02:07:46,260
Fliss.

3853
02:07:46,300 --> 02:07:47,120
Oh no.

3854
02:07:47,540 --> 02:07:47,760
Fliss.

3855
02:07:47,860 --> 02:07:48,200
Oh no.

3856
02:07:49,660 --> 02:07:51,080
He sounds really concerned.

3857
02:07:51,440 --> 02:07:51,760
Where are the others?

3858
02:07:51,900 --> 02:07:52,300
Oh no.

3859
02:07:52,780 --> 02:07:53,180
Fliss.

3860
02:07:54,560 --> 02:07:56,400
Oh no, the other pirates are coming over.

3861
02:07:56,800 --> 02:07:58,400
This is such a long cutscene.

3862
02:07:59,140 --> 02:08:00,980
Oh my god, don't gasp like that.

3863
02:08:01,240 --> 02:08:02,060
Oh wait, it's the gun.

3864
02:08:02,180 --> 02:08:02,940
It's the guy with the gun.

3865
02:08:03,320 --> 02:08:04,040
Stop screaming.

3866
02:08:04,220 --> 02:08:05,280
I'm trying to hear what's going on.

3867
02:08:05,500 --> 02:08:05,920
I'm not screaming.

3868
02:08:07,080 --> 02:08:07,460
Stop screaming.

3869
02:08:07,780 --> 02:08:09,800
I want to know where the others are.

3870
02:08:11,580 --> 02:08:12,000
Oh.

3871
02:08:12,200 --> 02:08:12,620
Oh.

3872
02:08:13,380 --> 02:08:14,140
Bye Fliss.

3873
02:08:14,140 --> 02:08:14,500
Brad.

3874
02:08:15,400 --> 02:08:15,920
Oh my god.

3875
02:08:16,020 --> 02:08:16,580
Oh my god.

3876
02:08:16,760 --> 02:08:17,180
Brad?

3877
02:08:17,180 --> 02:08:17,560
Oh my god, who's Brad?

3878
02:08:17,740 --> 02:08:18,560
Who's gonna be doing it?

3879
02:08:18,580 --> 02:08:19,220
Who's gonna be doing it?

3880
02:08:19,240 --> 02:08:19,980
Who's gonna be doing it?

3881
02:08:19,980 --> 02:08:21,260
Oh no.

3882
02:08:21,360 --> 02:08:21,860
Oh my god.

3883
02:08:23,220 --> 02:08:24,660
Alright, I see you.

3884
02:08:24,960 --> 02:08:25,900
Oh come on, Brad.

3885
02:08:26,120 --> 02:08:26,620
What the hell?

3886
02:08:28,720 --> 02:08:29,460
That's not us.

3887
02:08:29,460 --> 02:08:30,040
That's not us.

3888
02:08:30,120 --> 02:08:30,620
It's the AI.

3889
02:08:31,220 --> 02:08:32,100
Yeah, it's the AI.

3890
02:08:34,600 --> 02:08:35,840
Wow, you guys.

3891
02:08:35,840 --> 02:08:36,600
Come on.

3892
02:08:36,680 --> 02:08:37,660
Don't let him out of your sight.

3893
02:08:37,700 --> 02:08:37,940
Okay.

3894
02:08:38,120 --> 02:08:39,880
Girl, you're holding a whole ass lantern.

3895
02:08:40,120 --> 02:08:41,300
I think it's our...

3896
02:08:41,300 --> 02:08:41,700
I think...

3897
02:08:41,700 --> 02:08:42,360
No, it's your fault.

3898
02:08:42,400 --> 02:08:44,780
You literally told Fliss to go down there and get the thing.

3899
02:08:47,780 --> 02:08:49,120
I mean, she should have...

3900
02:08:49,120 --> 02:08:50,980
She was the one who brought it up in the first place.

3901
02:08:51,280 --> 02:08:51,560
Rat.

3902
02:08:52,460 --> 02:08:53,880
That's a very sick rat.

3903
02:08:55,200 --> 02:08:56,240
Oh, you're Fliss?

3904
02:08:57,100 --> 02:08:57,980
Am I Fliss?

3905
02:08:58,440 --> 02:08:58,820
Yes.

3906
02:08:59,280 --> 02:09:00,160
Now, why would I tell you?

3907
02:09:01,020 --> 02:09:01,600
Uh oh.

3908
02:09:01,840 --> 02:09:02,340
Uh oh.

3909
02:09:02,920 --> 02:09:03,760
We're split up.

3910
02:09:03,800 --> 02:09:04,520
Wait, what are you?

3911
02:09:04,520 --> 02:09:04,880
Who are...

3912
02:09:04,880 --> 02:09:05,440
Are you Julia?

3913
02:09:05,520 --> 02:09:06,020
I'm Alex.

3914
02:09:06,260 --> 02:09:06,580
I'm Alex.

3915
02:09:06,620 --> 02:09:07,060
Are you Alex?

3916
02:09:07,660 --> 02:09:08,100
Yeah.

3917
02:09:09,520 --> 02:09:10,400
Are you getting...

3918
02:09:10,400 --> 02:09:10,760
Are you...

3919
02:09:10,760 --> 02:09:11,640
Oh, no.

3920
02:09:11,720 --> 02:09:12,300
We're split up.

3921
02:09:14,320 --> 02:09:15,120
This is you.

3922
02:09:15,200 --> 02:09:16,200
Are they interrogating you?

3923
02:09:16,680 --> 02:09:17,560
No, we're just...

3924
02:09:17,560 --> 02:09:18,420
We're just walking.

3925
02:09:18,540 --> 02:09:19,520
We're walking somewhere.

3926
02:09:20,100 --> 02:09:20,680
Oh, okay.

3927
02:09:20,960 --> 02:09:21,480
All right.

3928
02:09:21,800 --> 02:09:22,820
We went somewhere else.

3929
02:09:22,820 --> 02:09:23,260
I might...

3930
02:09:23,260 --> 02:09:25,000
We might have these two die.

3931
02:09:25,580 --> 02:09:26,020
What?

3932
02:09:26,840 --> 02:09:29,440
Are you sacrificing Fliss so that...

3933
02:09:30,380 --> 02:09:32,380
No, I said both of us.

3934
02:09:32,440 --> 02:09:32,860
No, Fliss is cool.

3935
02:09:32,860 --> 02:09:33,600
You're the one that go down.

3936
02:09:33,620 --> 02:09:34,460
Fliss, you're fucking...

3937
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:36,080
Go down there?

3938
02:09:37,140 --> 02:09:37,920
No, she...

3939
02:09:37,920 --> 02:09:38,640
It was her idea.

3940
02:09:39,020 --> 02:09:40,740
She said, I'm gonna go down there and get it.

3941
02:09:40,780 --> 02:09:41,220
And I said, okay.

3942
02:09:41,760 --> 02:09:42,480
Do it, bet.

3943
02:09:42,660 --> 02:09:43,720
That's what I said to her.

3944
02:09:44,020 --> 02:09:44,520
Leave that alone.

3945
02:09:45,400 --> 02:09:46,120
Oh my God.

3946
02:09:46,260 --> 02:09:47,800
Julia looks really scary.

3947
02:09:48,080 --> 02:09:49,140
She just looks like a...

3948
02:09:49,660 --> 02:09:52,320
She looks so scary just standing there in the middle of the walkway.

3949
02:09:52,980 --> 02:09:54,340
Yeah, we like Fliss.

3950
02:09:54,680 --> 02:09:55,900
We don't want Fliss to die.

3951
02:09:57,060 --> 02:09:59,120
You're the one that sent Fliss down there.

3952
02:09:59,160 --> 02:10:02,360
You had a choice not to send Fliss down there.

3953
02:10:02,700 --> 02:10:03,540
She probably...

3954
02:10:03,540 --> 02:10:04,440
She wasn't gonna listen to me.

3955
02:10:04,440 --> 02:10:05,360
Let's be honest.

3956
02:10:05,420 --> 02:10:06,420
She wasn't gonna listen to me.

3957
02:10:07,260 --> 02:10:09,620
She was gonna be like, I'm going down there.

3958
02:10:09,700 --> 02:10:10,260
What do you want me to do?

3959
02:10:10,260 --> 02:10:10,940
We don't know that.

3960
02:10:10,940 --> 02:10:11,580
We don't know that.

3961
02:10:11,640 --> 02:10:12,720
You gave her the choice.

3962
02:10:14,460 --> 02:10:16,620
Fliss was telling you to do it.

3963
02:10:17,340 --> 02:10:18,020
No, she...

3964
02:10:18,020 --> 02:10:18,680
No, she wasn't.

3965
02:10:18,700 --> 02:10:19,840
She said, I'm gonna go get that.

3966
02:10:20,340 --> 02:10:23,860
And then my choice was tell her don't or go get it.

3967
02:10:24,700 --> 02:10:26,520
And she made her choice.

3968
02:10:26,780 --> 02:10:27,220
She should...

3969
02:10:27,220 --> 02:10:27,920
She could have been like...

3970
02:10:27,920 --> 02:10:29,300
Yeah, but you said go get it.

3971
02:10:29,300 --> 02:10:30,540
You chose go get it, didn't you?

3972
02:10:30,700 --> 02:10:31,380
I'm stuck.

3973
02:10:31,400 --> 02:10:31,960
I'm stuck.

3974
02:10:33,540 --> 02:10:34,120
Hold on.

3975
02:10:34,200 --> 02:10:34,420
Where is Fliss?

3976
02:10:34,440 --> 02:10:34,860
Where's the door?

3977
02:10:35,020 --> 02:10:35,560
Hold on.

3978
02:10:35,680 --> 02:10:36,280
Okay, everybody.

3979
02:10:36,520 --> 02:10:37,040
I'm stuck.

3980
02:10:37,560 --> 02:10:38,140
I'm stuck.

3981
02:10:38,680 --> 02:10:39,660
You guys, I'm stuck.

3982
02:10:39,740 --> 02:10:41,740
Oh my God.

3983
02:10:43,380 --> 02:10:45,480
There's a dead guy.

3984
02:10:45,620 --> 02:10:46,300
There's a dead guy.

3985
02:10:46,720 --> 02:10:47,300
Uh-oh.

3986
02:10:48,020 --> 02:10:49,900
Oh, it was just a hat.

3987
02:10:50,040 --> 02:10:50,360
JK.

3988
02:10:53,840 --> 02:10:54,500
I'm stuck.

3989
02:10:54,640 --> 02:10:55,660
I'm so stuck.

3990
02:10:56,120 --> 02:10:57,180
How do I get through here?

3991
02:10:57,600 --> 02:10:59,980
So, we have a very paranoid gunsman.

3992
02:11:00,800 --> 02:11:01,840
He's very scared.

3993
02:11:02,700 --> 02:11:03,880
Is he experiencing...

3994
02:11:03,880 --> 02:11:04,320
Oh, there we go.

3995
02:11:04,360 --> 02:11:04,420
He's like, I'm stuck.

3996
02:11:04,440 --> 02:11:04,700
Is he experiencing...

3997
02:11:04,960 --> 02:11:05,900
Is he experiencing...

3998
02:11:05,900 --> 02:11:05,960
No!

3999
02:11:08,160 --> 02:11:09,060
What's going on?

4000
02:11:09,060 --> 02:11:10,340
What's going on on your side?

4001
02:11:11,180 --> 02:11:11,840
I'm fine.

4002
02:11:12,020 --> 02:11:12,620
Everything's fine.

4003
02:11:12,840 --> 02:11:14,060
I have a hat now.

4004
02:11:16,160 --> 02:11:16,800
We have?

4005
02:11:17,100 --> 02:11:17,440
Yeah.

4006
02:11:17,840 --> 02:11:18,640
I got...

4007
02:11:18,640 --> 02:11:19,280
Medan.

4008
02:11:19,360 --> 02:11:20,520
I got Medan's hat.

4009
02:11:21,200 --> 02:11:21,600
What?

4010
02:11:22,220 --> 02:11:23,320
You got the man.

4011
02:11:23,520 --> 02:11:24,500
I got the man.

4012
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:27,400
Of Medan.

4013
02:11:27,400 --> 02:11:27,420
Wait.

4014
02:11:27,560 --> 02:11:27,920
Hold on.

4015
02:11:27,920 --> 02:11:29,200
There's gotta be stuff in here to find.

4016
02:11:29,200 --> 02:11:29,600
All right.

4017
02:11:30,360 --> 02:11:31,300
There were screams.

4018
02:11:31,320 --> 02:11:31,980
There's not a dead body in here.

4019
02:11:32,040 --> 02:11:33,160
There's not a dead body in here.

4020
02:11:33,160 --> 02:11:33,960
There's not a dead body.

4021
02:11:34,040 --> 02:11:34,420
Medan.

4022
02:11:34,440 --> 02:11:35,840
There's screams on my end.

4023
02:11:35,960 --> 02:11:36,300
Medan.

4024
02:11:36,380 --> 02:11:37,720
There's screams on my end.

4025
02:11:38,320 --> 02:11:38,840
You're...

4026
02:11:39,240 --> 02:11:39,840
Take your meds.

4027
02:11:39,840 --> 02:11:40,260
Take your meds.

4028
02:11:42,420 --> 02:11:43,460
Don't look.

4029
02:11:43,640 --> 02:11:43,880
It's fine.

4030
02:11:44,740 --> 02:11:47,000
There's scary stuff over here.

4031
02:11:48,280 --> 02:11:49,840
I just saw some organs.

4032
02:11:49,940 --> 02:11:50,260
Okay.

4033
02:11:50,340 --> 02:11:50,860
Chill.

4034
02:11:51,060 --> 02:11:51,760
Calm down.

4035
02:11:51,900 --> 02:11:52,620
You saw organs?

4036
02:11:53,160 --> 02:11:53,640
Yes.

4037
02:11:53,720 --> 02:11:54,660
They were organs.

4038
02:11:54,920 --> 02:11:56,340
They were like live organs.

4039
02:11:56,720 --> 02:11:58,840
Somehow they were live in the...

4040
02:11:59,320 --> 02:11:59,580
Wait.

4041
02:11:59,680 --> 02:11:59,940
What?

4042
02:11:59,980 --> 02:12:00,620
You found a secret.

4043
02:12:02,240 --> 02:12:02,760
Oh.

4044
02:12:02,840 --> 02:12:03,560
I found...

4045
02:12:04,440 --> 02:12:04,560
Oh.

4046
02:12:04,560 --> 02:12:05,060
I found a beef casserole.

4047
02:12:06,760 --> 02:12:07,480
Oh Christ.

4048
02:12:07,640 --> 02:12:08,080
No way.

4049
02:12:08,280 --> 02:12:08,680
Oh Christ.

4050
02:12:09,040 --> 02:12:09,640
That guy...

4051
02:12:09,640 --> 02:12:10,620
Tuesday was cereal.

4052
02:12:11,040 --> 02:12:12,940
That guy's probably still right here with us.

4053
02:12:14,400 --> 02:12:15,400
You died, didn't you?

4054
02:12:15,440 --> 02:12:15,860
You're both dead, are you?

4055
02:12:15,860 --> 02:12:17,240
Home fried potatoes.

4056
02:12:18,120 --> 02:12:19,140
Boiled eggs.

4057
02:12:19,540 --> 02:12:20,580
I found a body.

4058
02:12:20,940 --> 02:12:21,660
There's no idea what you're talking about.

4059
02:12:21,720 --> 02:12:22,740
I found...

4060
02:12:25,520 --> 02:12:26,960
You're like cereal.

4061
02:12:27,420 --> 02:12:29,060
Back on jokey side.

4062
02:12:29,140 --> 02:12:29,420
Cereal, potatoes.

4063
02:12:29,420 --> 02:12:30,080
There's a body.

4064
02:12:31,400 --> 02:12:32,360
I found a body.

4065
02:12:33,900 --> 02:12:34,420
I found...

4066
02:12:38,610 --> 02:12:39,770
That's not until...

4067
02:12:39,770 --> 02:12:40,970
That's not until Fridays.

4068
02:12:41,310 --> 02:12:41,970
Come on.

4069
02:12:44,710 --> 02:12:46,430
Body is not on the menu yet.

4070
02:12:46,470 --> 02:12:46,610
Wait.

4071
02:12:46,690 --> 02:12:47,370
There's soup here.

4072
02:12:47,710 --> 02:12:48,490
You want some?

4073
02:12:48,570 --> 02:12:50,070
But we gotta keep moving and find Olsen.

4074
02:12:50,210 --> 02:12:50,650
Oh.

4075
02:12:50,870 --> 02:12:51,310
Now.

4076
02:12:51,510 --> 02:12:51,670
Oh.

4077
02:12:52,410 --> 02:12:53,690
Soup du jour, Matt.

4078
02:12:53,810 --> 02:12:54,990
I found another secret.

4079
02:12:56,890 --> 02:12:57,830
Oh my God, Julia.

4080
02:12:59,670 --> 02:13:00,950
There's no time for messing around.

4081
02:13:01,190 --> 02:13:01,590
Alex.

4082
02:13:01,910 --> 02:13:02,350
God.

4083
02:13:03,630 --> 02:13:04,330
Oh no.

4084
02:13:04,390 --> 02:13:05,630
The stinky feet is here.

4085
02:13:06,010 --> 02:13:06,630
Oh, I have to go.

4086
02:13:06,630 --> 02:13:07,370
I have stinky feet too.

4087
02:13:07,490 --> 02:13:07,870
I just noticed.

4088
02:13:08,130 --> 02:13:08,190
Oh.

4089
02:13:09,110 --> 02:13:10,150
Oh my God.

4090
02:13:10,290 --> 02:13:10,950
Where are...

4091
02:13:10,950 --> 02:13:12,430
Why did we split up?

4092
02:13:13,110 --> 02:13:13,770
It's fine.

4093
02:13:14,550 --> 02:13:14,950
Oh.

4094
02:13:15,070 --> 02:13:15,850
There's a child.

4095
02:13:15,950 --> 02:13:17,370
I think there's running children again.

4096
02:13:17,390 --> 02:13:17,890
You're really...

4097
02:13:17,890 --> 02:13:18,170
Okay.

4098
02:13:18,210 --> 02:13:19,150
You're really in trouble.

4099
02:13:21,090 --> 02:13:23,130
I haven't seen anything yet.

4100
02:13:23,190 --> 02:13:25,770
I remember the last time there was running children.

4101
02:13:28,130 --> 02:13:28,730
Uh oh.

4102
02:13:28,830 --> 02:13:29,170
Wait.

4103
02:13:29,230 --> 02:13:29,870
So I heard something.

4104
02:13:30,110 --> 02:13:30,910
What did I hear?

4105
02:13:32,430 --> 02:13:33,410
I found a notebook.

4106
02:13:34,250 --> 02:13:35,210
It says...

4107
02:13:35,690 --> 02:13:36,590
What does it say?

4108
02:13:36,590 --> 02:13:36,610
It says...

4109
02:13:36,610 --> 02:13:38,690
Uh, nothing.

4110
02:13:38,850 --> 02:13:39,590
I can't even open...

4111
02:13:39,590 --> 02:13:40,830
Open the notebook, idiot.

4112
02:13:41,230 --> 02:13:41,710
Oh, I just...

4113
02:13:41,710 --> 02:13:42,350
Oh, there we go.

4114
02:13:43,130 --> 02:13:43,610
Oh.

4115
02:13:43,850 --> 02:13:44,330
Okay.

4116
02:13:44,410 --> 02:13:44,910
It's a diary.

4117
02:13:45,370 --> 02:13:46,290
Oh, read it.

4118
02:13:46,390 --> 02:13:47,490
Read that diary.

4119
02:13:49,750 --> 02:13:51,030
June 18th, Wednesday.

4120
02:13:52,610 --> 02:13:56,470
We hadn't been at sea long and I'm sick of the damn food already.

4121
02:13:56,910 --> 02:13:59,570
That muck we ate tonight was a joke.

4122
02:13:59,870 --> 02:14:02,990
The cooks do their best with what we got, I'm sure.

4123
02:14:03,070 --> 02:14:04,690
But man, I'd kill for something fresh.

4124
02:14:05,270 --> 02:14:06,590
First thing I'm doing with my life is to eat.

4125
02:14:06,590 --> 02:14:09,030
And when I get home is having me a tall glass of milk.

4126
02:14:12,630 --> 02:14:14,150
June 19th, Thursday.

4127
02:14:15,350 --> 02:14:20,410
Every one of the US papers was talking about that massacre in Philly.

4128
02:14:20,670 --> 02:14:22,190
Are these guys American or...?

4129
02:14:22,190 --> 02:14:27,290
All I'm saying is while you're reading this diary, our kidnapper fucking died.

4130
02:14:31,910 --> 02:14:32,910
I can't...

4131
02:14:32,910 --> 02:14:36,570
I'm just like, listen, you ate the diary and a kidnapper died.

4132
02:14:40,430 --> 02:14:50,110
It's crazy to think how we're out here traveling the world trying to keep our country safe when there's people killing each other in the streets back home.

4133
02:14:50,330 --> 02:14:55,310
I could sure use a beer after reading about how the captain has issued a ban on booze.

4134
02:14:55,390 --> 02:14:57,370
Guess I'll be counting sheep tonight.

4135
02:14:58,230 --> 02:14:59,310
Oh my god, there's more?

4136
02:14:59,590 --> 02:15:00,110
Oh no.

4137
02:15:01,810 --> 02:15:03,110
Oh my god, there's more.

4138
02:15:03,430 --> 02:15:03,810
Oh!

4139
02:15:04,310 --> 02:15:05,610
We found a secret!

4140
02:15:06,070 --> 02:15:06,550
Who found a secret?

4141
02:15:06,570 --> 02:15:07,110
Was it you?

4142
02:15:07,370 --> 02:15:08,550
No, oh wait, I found it.

4143
02:15:08,590 --> 02:15:09,710
Yeah, I found the secret!

4144
02:15:10,570 --> 02:15:11,690
June 20th, Friday.

4145
02:15:12,330 --> 02:15:17,130
Some of the guys had a little wrestling competition in one of the cargo holds today.

4146
02:15:17,490 --> 02:15:21,070
I did okay, but Wagner eventually knocked me out of it.

4147
02:15:21,150 --> 02:15:25,030
I joked he should be disqualified on account of his size, but no dice.

4148
02:15:25,370 --> 02:15:26,430
I like how you're reading it.

4149
02:15:26,490 --> 02:15:30,410
I'm trying to find a way out and you're just standing there reading the diary.

4150
02:15:31,390 --> 02:15:33,850
It took a whole crowd of people to pin him down.

4151
02:15:34,230 --> 02:15:36,550
He certainly ain't eating the same as the rest of us.

4152
02:15:36,550 --> 02:15:37,330
That's for sure.

4153
02:15:38,350 --> 02:15:39,870
June 21st, Saturday.

4154
02:15:40,650 --> 02:15:45,430
I'm sure the cargo we have in the hold has something to do with the squad that went missing.

4155
02:15:45,810 --> 02:15:51,990
Their leader, Jones, heard a legend about a room full of ancient solid gold statues from a Manchurian child emperor.

4156
02:15:52,770 --> 02:15:53,570
Oh, the child!

4157
02:15:53,570 --> 02:15:57,350
They were said to be cursed, but that sounds like a load of baloney.

4158
02:15:57,730 --> 02:15:58,470
It's the child!

4159
02:15:59,230 --> 02:15:59,630
It's the child!

4160
02:15:59,650 --> 02:16:06,530
Also, Min, I hope to god that you're heading over to where I'm heading over, because I'm progressing right now.

4161
02:16:07,230 --> 02:16:08,010
I'm reading!

4162
02:16:08,350 --> 02:16:08,870
I'm progressing!

4163
02:16:08,930 --> 02:16:10,150
It's knowledge, okay?

4164
02:16:10,790 --> 02:16:13,650
I don't know if they found them, but they never did return from their mission.

4165
02:16:13,770 --> 02:16:14,770
Maybe they're returning now.

4166
02:16:16,010 --> 02:16:17,050
Okay, that's all of it.

4167
02:16:17,130 --> 02:16:17,310
Cool.

4168
02:16:17,550 --> 02:16:18,170
Alright, cool.

4169
02:16:18,450 --> 02:16:21,470
I got away and I'm back in the cargo hold.

4170
02:16:22,210 --> 02:16:23,230
Oh, I'm far.

4171
02:16:23,590 --> 02:16:24,390
I don't know where I am.

4172
02:16:24,390 --> 02:16:24,950
Yeah, I could tell.

4173
02:16:25,170 --> 02:16:26,090
I could tell.

4174
02:16:27,950 --> 02:16:28,910
Oh, I got the knife.

4175
02:16:29,630 --> 02:16:30,910
I heard something, though.

4176
02:16:30,930 --> 02:16:32,250
I think I'm starting to hear people.

4177
02:16:32,450 --> 02:16:32,770
Uh oh.

4178
02:16:33,370 --> 02:16:35,270
Wait, I see a premonition picture!

4179
02:16:35,470 --> 02:16:35,690
Oh, I see a premonition picture!

4180
02:16:35,690 --> 02:16:36,090
Oh, I see a premonition picture!

4181
02:16:36,090 --> 02:16:36,130
Oh, I see a premonition picture!

4182
02:16:37,030 --> 02:16:38,150
I'm getting a premonition.

4183
02:16:38,790 --> 02:16:39,910
I'm getting a premonition right now.

4184
02:16:39,910 --> 02:16:40,510
What was your premonition?

4185
02:16:40,510 --> 02:16:44,670
Mine was the one where, like, it was a guy in a hood with a stick.

4186
02:16:45,210 --> 02:16:45,930
Oh my god!

4187
02:16:46,030 --> 02:16:47,590
I just saw Bradley's death!

4188
02:16:48,130 --> 02:16:49,070
Wait, how does he die?

4189
02:16:49,110 --> 02:16:49,470
How does he...

4190
02:16:55,300 --> 02:16:56,340
Wait, what is someone...

4191
02:16:56,340 --> 02:16:57,160
I just picked up the knife!

4192
02:16:59,380 --> 02:17:02,220
...wearing a raincoat.

4193
02:17:02,800 --> 02:17:03,920
Why'd you pick up the knife?

4194
02:17:04,020 --> 02:17:05,700
No, he was the one that was holding the...

4195
02:17:05,700 --> 02:17:06,600
I didn't know!

4196
02:17:07,220 --> 02:17:08,420
I picked up the knife!

4197
02:17:08,520 --> 02:17:10,840
I literally just picked up the knife while you said that.

4198
02:17:11,260 --> 02:17:11,640
Oh!

4199
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:12,380
Ah!

4200
02:17:12,560 --> 02:17:12,880
I'm sorry.

4201
02:17:12,900 --> 02:17:13,420
What just happened?

4202
02:17:15,080 --> 02:17:16,240
Bradley, what's going on?

4203
02:17:16,400 --> 02:17:17,240
I doomed him.

4204
02:17:17,420 --> 02:17:17,860
I...

4205
02:17:17,860 --> 02:17:19,280
I'm worried I picked up the knife!

4206
02:17:20,500 --> 02:17:21,220
I'm scared.

4207
02:17:21,660 --> 02:17:22,220
What is?

4208
02:17:23,700 --> 02:17:24,940
Something's moving in the shadows.

4209
02:17:25,260 --> 02:17:26,100
Oh, Charles!

4210
02:17:26,120 --> 02:17:26,500
Probably just a rat.

4211
02:17:29,320 --> 02:17:29,800
Rats.

4212
02:17:32,680 --> 02:17:34,220
My relationship with...

4213
02:17:34,220 --> 02:17:35,420
Are you fixing...

4214
02:17:35,420 --> 02:17:36,860
My relationship with Julia went up!

4215
02:17:37,640 --> 02:17:38,440
But she...

4216
02:17:38,440 --> 02:17:39,500
She was really...

4217
02:17:39,500 --> 02:17:39,880
Oh!

4218
02:17:40,120 --> 02:17:40,540
Oh!

4219
02:17:40,600 --> 02:17:40,620
Oh!

4220
02:17:40,620 --> 02:17:40,800
Oh!

4221
02:17:40,800 --> 02:17:41,220
Oh!

4222
02:17:41,820 --> 02:17:42,300
Oh!

4223
02:17:42,400 --> 02:17:42,880
Oh!

4224
02:17:42,900 --> 02:17:43,560
Oh my god!

4225
02:17:43,580 --> 02:17:44,560
They split me and Brad!

4226
02:17:47,400 --> 02:17:48,640
Brad and I got split off!

4227
02:17:49,320 --> 02:17:49,780
Wait, how did...

4228
02:17:49,780 --> 02:17:50,400
Wait, you split up?

4229
02:17:50,400 --> 02:17:51,260
You're by yourself now?

4230
02:17:51,420 --> 02:17:51,580
Yeah!

4231
02:17:51,580 --> 02:17:52,040
Yeah, I'm by myself!

4232
02:17:52,120 --> 02:17:52,480
The door...

4233
02:17:52,480 --> 02:17:53,480
The door closed on us!

4234
02:17:53,940 --> 02:17:54,480
Uh oh.

4235
02:17:55,060 --> 02:17:55,600
It's okay.

4236
02:17:55,820 --> 02:17:55,980
Oh my god!

4237
02:17:56,040 --> 02:17:56,400
Wait!

4238
02:17:56,480 --> 02:17:57,820
I'm in the room with the dead bodies!

4239
02:17:58,160 --> 02:17:58,900
Uh oh.

4240
02:17:59,800 --> 02:18:00,400
Which dead bodies?

4241
02:18:00,780 --> 02:18:01,180
Uh oh.

4242
02:18:01,180 --> 02:18:01,440
Which...

4243
02:18:01,440 --> 02:18:01,780
Uh oh.

4244
02:18:01,780 --> 02:18:02,840
Which dead bodies?

4245
02:18:03,460 --> 02:18:03,860
The...

4246
02:18:03,860 --> 02:18:04,000
The...

4247
02:18:05,160 --> 02:18:07,720
The ones that were carried on the ship at the beginning!

4248
02:18:10,360 --> 02:18:11,080
Oh my god!

4249
02:18:11,140 --> 02:18:11,840
I'm going crazy!

4250
02:18:11,980 --> 02:18:12,260
Brad!

4251
02:18:12,360 --> 02:18:12,400
Brad!

4252
02:18:12,400 --> 02:18:12,680
I couldn't pick any other options.

4253
02:18:12,680 --> 02:18:12,880
Brad!

4254
02:18:13,520 --> 02:18:14,960
I'm seeing hallucinations!

4255
02:18:15,460 --> 02:18:16,000
Uh oh.

4256
02:18:16,880 --> 02:18:17,600
Oh my god!

4257
02:18:17,660 --> 02:18:18,500
I'm with the bodies!

4258
02:18:18,640 --> 02:18:19,460
I'm with the dead bodies!

4259
02:18:19,620 --> 02:18:19,720
Oh!

4260
02:18:19,820 --> 02:18:20,520
I can look at the...

4261
02:18:20,520 --> 02:18:22,040
I can observe every single body!

4262
02:18:22,300 --> 02:18:22,820
Oh god!

4263
02:18:22,840 --> 02:18:23,160
I'm scared!

4264
02:18:23,200 --> 02:18:23,420
I'm scared!

4265
02:18:23,420 --> 02:18:23,920
Oh god!

4266
02:18:23,960 --> 02:18:24,220
I'm scared!

4267
02:18:24,280 --> 02:18:24,460
I'm scared!

4268
02:18:24,520 --> 02:18:24,660
I'm scared!

4269
02:18:25,680 --> 02:18:26,400
I'm scared!

4270
02:18:26,400 --> 02:18:27,340
We're both fucking up!

4271
02:18:27,380 --> 02:18:28,320
We're both fucking up!

4272
02:18:28,360 --> 02:18:28,540
Man!

4273
02:18:28,620 --> 02:18:29,500
We're supposed to see that!

4274
02:18:30,360 --> 02:18:31,540
We're both messing up!

4275
02:18:31,780 --> 02:18:32,600
There's two bodies in here!

4276
02:18:32,940 --> 02:18:33,820
There's two bodies!

4277
02:18:34,440 --> 02:18:34,980
What the?

4278
02:18:35,460 --> 02:18:35,960
What's this?

4279
02:18:36,860 --> 02:18:38,100
Practically falling off.

4280
02:18:38,240 --> 02:18:39,000
Anyway, what does that mean?

4281
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:39,680
Oh, that's a bullet!

4282
02:18:40,400 --> 02:18:42,000
Um, is this even human?

4283
02:18:42,120 --> 02:18:42,720
What is this?

4284
02:18:44,180 --> 02:18:45,440
What is going on?

4285
02:18:45,860 --> 02:18:49,560
I just want to reunite with at least somebody!

4286
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:50,880
I don't want to...

4287
02:18:51,940 --> 02:18:52,780
Oh fuck!

4288
02:18:56,450 --> 02:18:57,310
Leave, leave, leave!

4289
02:18:57,530 --> 02:18:58,910
Hold on, I'm not done yet!

4290
02:18:59,370 --> 02:19:00,290
I'm not done yet!

4291
02:19:00,670 --> 02:19:01,150
Oh!

4292
02:19:01,390 --> 02:19:02,230
There's zombies!

4293
02:19:03,770 --> 02:19:04,970
Are you okay?

4294
02:19:05,150 --> 02:19:05,610
What's going on?

4295
02:19:05,610 --> 02:19:05,910
I'm not!

4296
02:19:06,030 --> 02:19:07,430
You found a secret!

4297
02:19:09,830 --> 02:19:11,330
You found a secret!

4298
02:19:11,390 --> 02:19:11,410
Oh my god!

4299
02:19:11,410 --> 02:19:12,430
There's zombies!

4300
02:19:14,230 --> 02:19:16,330
I'm just looking at the bodies!

4301
02:19:19,370 --> 02:19:20,770
I don't...

4302
02:19:20,770 --> 02:19:22,270
I found another secret!

4303
02:19:22,850 --> 02:19:23,810
Save Brad!

4304
02:19:23,950 --> 02:19:24,470
Save Brad!

4305
02:19:25,330 --> 02:19:26,350
Save Brad!

4306
02:19:26,850 --> 02:19:27,690
Save him!

4307
02:19:29,410 --> 02:19:30,950
I got another secret.

4308
02:19:31,250 --> 02:19:32,190
Plus four for life!

4309
02:19:32,510 --> 02:19:33,790
What do you mean?

4310
02:19:33,970 --> 02:19:35,510
You're getting secrets!

4311
02:19:35,910 --> 02:19:36,270
I'm...

4312
02:19:36,270 --> 02:19:36,430
Woo!

4313
02:19:37,270 --> 02:19:37,970
I'm...

4314
02:19:37,970 --> 02:19:38,010
Woo!

4315
02:19:38,010 --> 02:19:38,450
Woo!

4316
02:19:39,530 --> 02:19:40,170
Woo!

4317
02:19:40,610 --> 02:19:40,730
Woo!

4318
02:19:40,730 --> 02:19:41,110
Woo!

4319
02:19:41,110 --> 02:19:41,170
Woo!

4320
02:19:41,170 --> 02:19:41,370
Woo!

4321
02:19:41,390 --> 02:19:43,950
What do you mean?

4322
02:19:44,470 --> 02:19:45,990
Oh my god!

4323
02:19:46,050 --> 02:19:47,210
There's something over here.

4324
02:19:47,570 --> 02:19:48,390
Uh oh.

4325
02:19:48,550 --> 02:19:48,870
Uh oh.

4326
02:19:50,350 --> 02:19:51,610
Something's gonna be behind here.

4327
02:19:51,650 --> 02:19:52,670
Something's gonna be behind here.

4328
02:19:52,790 --> 02:19:53,030
Oh my god!

4329
02:19:55,410 --> 02:19:57,110
There might be...

4330
02:19:58,790 --> 02:19:59,970
Brad might be dead.

4331
02:20:00,690 --> 02:20:01,210
What?

4332
02:20:01,610 --> 02:20:02,130
Brad!

4333
02:20:03,030 --> 02:20:04,890
Wait, it's not letting me do it now.

4334
02:20:04,930 --> 02:20:05,170
Oh no!

4335
02:20:05,170 --> 02:20:06,510
I'm in the ballroom!

4336
02:20:06,870 --> 02:20:07,550
Hold on.

4337
02:20:07,590 --> 02:20:10,090
I remember what happens on Ghost Ship!

4338
02:20:10,370 --> 02:20:11,370
Not the ballroom!

4339
02:20:13,010 --> 02:20:13,510
It's okay.

4340
02:20:13,670 --> 02:20:14,330
That was outside.

4341
02:20:14,510 --> 02:20:15,030
That was outside.

4342
02:20:15,230 --> 02:20:16,230
Wait, it's not letting me do it.

4343
02:20:16,350 --> 02:20:16,410
What do you mean?

4344
02:20:16,410 --> 02:20:17,330
That was inside the ballroom!

4345
02:20:17,490 --> 02:20:18,650
I saw the movie!

4346
02:20:19,250 --> 02:20:19,690
It's the...

4347
02:20:19,690 --> 02:20:20,910
No, they were out on the deck!

4348
02:20:20,970 --> 02:20:21,890
They were out on the deck!

4349
02:20:25,330 --> 02:20:25,630
Ballroom!

4350
02:20:25,910 --> 02:20:26,150
Wait!

4351
02:20:26,670 --> 02:20:27,950
The ballroom's on a deck.

4352
02:20:28,630 --> 02:20:29,230
Uh oh.

4353
02:20:29,330 --> 02:20:30,150
That might be stuck.

4354
02:20:31,710 --> 02:20:32,570
What are you...

4355
02:20:32,570 --> 02:20:33,330
What are you doing?

4356
02:20:33,330 --> 02:20:33,850
I'm trying to use...

4357
02:20:33,850 --> 02:20:34,890
I'm trying to do this.

4358
02:20:34,970 --> 02:20:36,790
I'm trying to do this, but it's not letting me.

4359
02:20:36,910 --> 02:20:37,950
My right stick is stuck.

4360
02:20:38,810 --> 02:20:39,490
I think...

4361
02:20:39,490 --> 02:20:39,950
Press it?

4362
02:20:41,650 --> 02:20:42,730
I think I'm having a doki.

4363
02:20:43,090 --> 02:20:44,730
I think I'm having a doki.

4364
02:20:44,730 --> 02:20:45,290
I'm having a doki bird problem.

4365
02:20:45,930 --> 02:20:47,870
You gotta wait until I progress.

4366
02:20:48,310 --> 02:20:49,370
Keep holding the trigger.

4367
02:20:49,570 --> 02:20:49,930
I am!

4368
02:20:50,090 --> 02:20:50,490
I am!

4369
02:20:51,070 --> 02:20:53,530
It doesn't let me progress unless I hold the trigger.

4370
02:20:54,370 --> 02:20:54,770
Hmm.

4371
02:20:55,730 --> 02:20:56,930
Is it the left one maybe?

4372
02:20:57,070 --> 02:20:57,250
No.

4373
02:20:57,530 --> 02:20:59,290
You're going through my problem now.

4374
02:20:59,550 --> 02:20:59,930
Yeah.

4375
02:21:02,050 --> 02:21:02,450
Good.

4376
02:21:02,890 --> 02:21:03,330
Actually, wait.

4377
02:21:03,370 --> 02:21:04,410
I don't think it'll let me...

4378
02:21:04,410 --> 02:21:04,610
Wait.

4379
02:21:04,730 --> 02:21:06,830
I don't think it'll actually let me progress unless I do...

4380
02:21:06,830 --> 02:21:07,050
Oh, wait.

4381
02:21:07,090 --> 02:21:07,890
No, there's a room over here.

4382
02:21:07,930 --> 02:21:08,230
Never mind.

4383
02:21:08,230 --> 02:21:08,830
Okay, let's go.

4384
02:21:10,090 --> 02:21:10,490
Okay.

4385
02:21:12,030 --> 02:21:12,750
Sorry, guys.

4386
02:21:12,830 --> 02:21:13,170
I tried.

4387
02:21:13,390 --> 02:21:13,990
I really did.

4388
02:21:14,070 --> 02:21:14,350
All right.

4389
02:21:14,350 --> 02:21:14,710
Let's see.

4390
02:21:14,730 --> 02:21:15,930
What did you have to do?

4391
02:21:16,810 --> 02:21:17,430
Spin it.

4392
02:21:17,510 --> 02:21:18,150
It was like...

4393
02:21:18,150 --> 02:21:19,850
I'm trying to open up a curtain.

4394
02:21:20,350 --> 02:21:21,270
Oh my god.

4395
02:21:21,550 --> 02:21:22,070
But like...

4396
02:21:22,590 --> 02:21:23,850
Hold the stick I was.

4397
02:21:24,210 --> 02:21:25,130
I'll try one more time.

4398
02:21:25,130 --> 02:21:26,890
Oh, there's a pentagram book.

4399
02:21:27,010 --> 02:21:30,490
There's like a sorcery Satan book in the ballroom.

4400
02:21:31,090 --> 02:21:31,970
That's not good.

4401
02:21:32,050 --> 02:21:32,670
Guess we'll never know.

4402
02:21:32,970 --> 02:21:34,030
Guess we'll never know.

4403
02:21:34,490 --> 02:21:36,250
I read the spooky book.

4404
02:21:37,370 --> 02:21:39,490
Oh, you're cursing us.

4405
02:21:39,630 --> 02:21:42,270
I read the spooky book and there's blood here.

4406
02:21:42,550 --> 02:21:44,410
There's blood in the ballroom.

4407
02:21:44,450 --> 02:21:44,710
You are so...

4408
02:21:44,730 --> 02:21:46,130
I haven't seen a whole lot of bad stuff.

4409
02:21:46,230 --> 02:21:47,530
I haven't seen anything.

4410
02:21:48,550 --> 02:21:49,330
That's on you.

4411
02:21:49,390 --> 02:21:51,230
You literally put me in this situation.

4412
02:21:52,010 --> 02:21:52,870
What do you mean?

4413
02:21:52,970 --> 02:21:53,850
I didn't do anything.

4414
02:21:54,770 --> 02:21:57,590
Oh, I'm in like a really bad area.

4415
02:21:57,870 --> 02:21:58,410
I feel like I'm...

4416
02:21:58,410 --> 02:21:59,510
Oh, what the?

4417
02:21:59,810 --> 02:22:02,170
Oh, there's a blood fountain.

4418
02:22:02,230 --> 02:22:04,510
Why do I get all the bad stuff?

4419
02:22:05,230 --> 02:22:07,130
I think I see a corpse.

4420
02:22:07,570 --> 02:22:08,290
Oh, oh.

4421
02:22:09,090 --> 02:22:09,710
Oh my god.

4422
02:22:09,730 --> 02:22:09,910
Oh.

4423
02:22:10,090 --> 02:22:12,570
There's literally a blood fountain here.

4424
02:22:13,510 --> 02:22:14,510
Wait, what's going on?

4425
02:22:14,610 --> 02:22:14,710
I don't know.

4426
02:22:14,710 --> 02:22:16,190
Wait, now they're real people.

4427
02:22:16,610 --> 02:22:16,970
What?

4428
02:22:17,470 --> 02:22:18,150
Oh my god.

4429
02:22:18,390 --> 02:22:19,170
What's going on?

4430
02:22:20,350 --> 02:22:21,190
Oh, what the?

4431
02:22:21,750 --> 02:22:22,330
I'm touching.

4432
02:22:22,490 --> 02:22:22,590
Oh.

4433
02:22:23,110 --> 02:22:23,870
Where are you touching?

4434
02:22:23,990 --> 02:22:24,730
Where are you touching, Mint?

4435
02:22:24,950 --> 02:22:26,470
I touched it.

4436
02:22:26,610 --> 02:22:27,190
I touched it.

4437
02:22:27,230 --> 02:22:28,050
You touched it?

4438
02:22:28,110 --> 02:22:29,290
You touched the bad thing?

4439
02:22:29,350 --> 02:22:32,530
Oh, and you were telling me not to touch the bad thing, but you're touching the bad thing.

4440
02:22:32,790 --> 02:22:33,050
I was...

4441
02:22:33,050 --> 02:22:34,610
I just booped a guy.

4442
02:22:34,750 --> 02:22:35,110
Come on.

4443
02:22:35,110 --> 02:22:36,590
A dead body became alive.

4444
02:22:36,830 --> 02:22:37,850
Is that not bad enough?

4445
02:22:38,330 --> 02:22:40,130
I just went boop on his face.

4446
02:22:40,130 --> 02:22:41,470
Oh, I see another premonition.

4447
02:22:42,110 --> 02:22:42,470
Oh.

4448
02:22:42,950 --> 02:22:43,590
Oh my god.

4449
02:22:43,950 --> 02:22:44,690
Wait, what just happened?

4450
02:22:44,690 --> 02:22:45,170
Wait, what?

4451
02:22:46,730 --> 02:22:48,370
Somebody's drowning on this one.

4452
02:22:49,130 --> 02:22:50,230
Yeah, I found the picture.

4453
02:22:51,790 --> 02:22:52,170
Oh.

4454
02:22:53,890 --> 02:22:55,270
Okay, I think I was too slow.

4455
02:22:56,450 --> 02:22:56,830
Oh.

4456
02:22:57,890 --> 02:22:59,030
I turned on the lights.

4457
02:22:59,070 --> 02:23:00,150
The lights are on now.

4458
02:23:01,510 --> 02:23:02,190
Oh, the lights are on.

4459
02:23:02,230 --> 02:23:02,710
Oh no!

4460
02:23:03,030 --> 02:23:03,630
It's the guy!

4461
02:23:04,150 --> 02:23:05,230
It's the guy with the hammer!

4462
02:23:05,350 --> 02:23:05,890
He's after me!

4463
02:23:08,350 --> 02:23:08,830
Oh wait.

4464
02:23:09,670 --> 02:23:10,390
I'm Bradley!

4465
02:23:11,110 --> 02:23:11,490
Bradley?

4466
02:23:11,810 --> 02:23:12,610
Wait, is he alive?

4467
02:23:12,790 --> 02:23:13,290
Bradley's alive?

4468
02:23:13,970 --> 02:23:14,350
Yeah!

4469
02:23:14,370 --> 02:23:14,670
Oh my god.

4470
02:23:14,670 --> 02:23:15,490
I did it!

4471
02:23:16,450 --> 02:23:17,550
Why am I by myself?

4472
02:23:18,150 --> 02:23:18,590
That's right.

4473
02:23:18,730 --> 02:23:19,330
I kept...

4474
02:23:21,230 --> 02:23:21,630
What?

4475
02:23:23,610 --> 02:23:24,970
I was following you.

4476
02:23:25,050 --> 02:23:25,990
He's like talking to it.

4477
02:23:26,030 --> 02:23:26,530
He's like, Fliss?

4478
02:23:26,670 --> 02:23:26,910
Hello?

4479
02:23:27,050 --> 02:23:27,370
Fliss?

4480
02:23:28,750 --> 02:23:29,150
Wait.

4481
02:23:30,210 --> 02:23:31,190
Wait, where'd you go?

4482
02:23:33,210 --> 02:23:34,890
I think I was following you.

4483
02:23:37,530 --> 02:23:37,930
Oh.

4484
02:23:38,310 --> 02:23:38,710
Oh.

4485
02:23:38,750 --> 02:23:39,330
I think I'm in trouble.

4486
02:23:39,770 --> 02:23:40,970
Oh, there's a dead body!

4487
02:23:41,170 --> 02:23:42,030
Yeah, you were in trouble.

4488
02:23:42,030 --> 02:23:42,810
I left you there.

4489
02:23:43,210 --> 02:23:43,710
I'm sorry.

4490
02:23:44,130 --> 02:23:44,530
I'm sorry.

4491
02:23:44,530 --> 02:23:44,650
I'm sorry.

4492
02:23:44,650 --> 02:23:46,070
I'm gonna touch this guy.

4493
02:23:46,170 --> 02:23:46,990
I'm gonna touch this guy.

4494
02:23:48,050 --> 02:23:49,570
Don't, don't, don't jump at me.

4495
02:23:49,690 --> 02:23:49,910
Don't jump.

4496
02:23:49,950 --> 02:23:50,070
Why?

4497
02:23:50,210 --> 02:23:51,690
Am I taking the bullet out of it?

4498
02:23:51,790 --> 02:23:51,910
Ew!

4499
02:23:55,110 --> 02:23:56,210
You're definitely in trouble.

4500
02:23:56,210 --> 02:23:57,050
I left you there.

4501
02:23:57,570 --> 02:23:58,390
Why'd you do that?

4502
02:23:58,510 --> 02:23:59,070
Why'd you do that?

4503
02:23:59,430 --> 02:24:00,670
I tried to save you.

4504
02:24:00,710 --> 02:24:01,690
I did quick time events.

4505
02:24:02,170 --> 02:24:02,670
You what?

4506
02:24:02,750 --> 02:24:04,370
You said you were gonna kill...

4507
02:24:06,730 --> 02:24:07,370
Oh shit!

4508
02:24:07,430 --> 02:24:08,270
I forgot!

4509
02:24:08,950 --> 02:24:09,290
I forgot!

4510
02:24:09,390 --> 02:24:10,230
You have to save myself!

4511
02:24:10,230 --> 02:24:11,190
I was scared!

4512
02:24:11,510 --> 02:24:12,830
I should have just left you!

4513
02:24:13,930 --> 02:24:14,330
No.

4514
02:24:14,370 --> 02:24:14,630
No.

4515
02:24:14,630 --> 02:24:15,130
You know what?

4516
02:24:15,190 --> 02:24:17,830
I kept him alive so you had to play him.

4517
02:24:19,330 --> 02:24:20,790
I'm playing PT actually.

4518
02:24:25,650 --> 02:24:27,950
I'm following you but you have less clothes on.

4519
02:24:29,590 --> 02:24:31,470
I think you're trying to seduce me.

4520
02:24:33,210 --> 02:24:33,970
I'm watch...

4521
02:24:33,970 --> 02:24:34,370
I'm following.

4522
02:24:34,690 --> 02:24:34,910
I'm following.

4523
02:24:36,570 --> 02:24:37,690
Wait, what happened?

4524
02:24:38,350 --> 02:24:38,790
Fliss!

4525
02:24:38,890 --> 02:24:39,570
Oh, oh.

4526
02:24:39,610 --> 02:24:40,690
She just disappeared.

4527
02:24:40,890 --> 02:24:41,930
Oh, she's back.

4528
02:24:42,090 --> 02:24:43,070
I think Fliss is a ghost.

4529
02:24:43,850 --> 02:24:44,610
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

4530
02:24:44,610 --> 02:24:45,290
That's what I saw too.

4531
02:24:46,290 --> 02:24:47,050
You saw yourself?

4532
02:24:47,470 --> 02:24:48,930
No, I knew you were a ghost.

4533
02:24:49,850 --> 02:24:51,430
Oh, I'm looking at the bullet again.

4534
02:24:52,930 --> 02:24:55,350
Oh, this time it says my name.

4535
02:24:55,590 --> 02:24:57,190
No, it says Alex on it!

4536
02:24:57,830 --> 02:24:59,130
Is Alex gonna get shot?

4537
02:24:59,610 --> 02:25:00,430
I think so.

4538
02:25:01,090 --> 02:25:01,730
Oh no.

4539
02:25:02,130 --> 02:25:03,810
Oh, Fliss, what does that mean?

4540
02:25:05,470 --> 02:25:05,970
Girl, what does that mean?

4541
02:25:05,970 --> 02:25:06,730
Do I open this again?

4542
02:25:10,370 --> 02:25:10,810
Nuke...

4543
02:25:10,810 --> 02:25:11,870
Oh, Metra Gold!

4544
02:25:13,270 --> 02:25:14,370
You found the gold.

4545
02:25:14,430 --> 02:25:14,590
I found the gold.

4546
02:25:15,290 --> 02:25:16,670
Guys, we're gonna be rich.

4547
02:25:16,830 --> 02:25:17,410
Don't be greedy.

4548
02:25:17,550 --> 02:25:18,210
Remember the hint.

4549
02:25:18,610 --> 02:25:19,670
I'm playing PT.

4550
02:25:19,910 --> 02:25:20,990
I'm playing PT real.

4551
02:25:24,510 --> 02:25:27,090
Now you know how I felt when I was...

4552
02:25:27,090 --> 02:25:27,550
Oh my god.

4553
02:25:27,550 --> 02:25:29,430
The guy with the gun is here now?

4554
02:25:29,610 --> 02:25:30,090
What's going on?

4555
02:25:30,090 --> 02:25:31,730
This is why I kept Bradley alive.

4556
02:25:32,170 --> 02:25:34,030
I can't see you in the weather, man.

4557
02:25:34,410 --> 02:25:36,330
This is why I kept Brad alive.

4558
02:25:36,830 --> 02:25:39,110
Now you have to deal with it.

4559
02:25:41,490 --> 02:25:43,110
The body is now...

4560
02:25:43,110 --> 02:25:44,470
It has textures floating.

4561
02:25:44,470 --> 02:25:44,570
It's like a...

4562
02:25:44,570 --> 02:25:45,410
What is that?

4563
02:25:45,510 --> 02:25:46,290
What is that?

4564
02:25:46,370 --> 02:25:48,170
What is going on on your head?

4565
02:25:50,270 --> 02:25:52,810
The game is glitching a little bit, I think.

4566
02:25:52,870 --> 02:25:53,350
There's like...

4567
02:25:53,350 --> 02:25:56,110
Oh, the bullet turned into a slug and it's eating me?

4568
02:25:56,310 --> 02:25:57,210
Okay, okay.

4569
02:25:57,310 --> 02:25:59,490
Are you killing Bradley off right now?

4570
02:26:01,870 --> 02:26:03,950
Oh, we got slugs on us.

4571
02:26:03,970 --> 02:26:04,950
We got slugs on us.

4572
02:26:05,030 --> 02:26:05,410
Found a secret.

4573
02:26:05,750 --> 02:26:06,350
Oh my god.

4574
02:26:07,270 --> 02:26:08,150
I'm exploring.

4575
02:26:08,690 --> 02:26:09,690
Yippee-ki-yay.

4576
02:26:11,630 --> 02:26:13,890
Oh, look at all of these items.

4577
02:26:13,890 --> 02:26:14,450
I'm playing PT.

4578
02:26:14,530 --> 02:26:17,510
Look at all these items around me.

4579
02:26:17,550 --> 02:26:18,950
Let me read some more.

4580
02:26:19,350 --> 02:26:20,170
Let me...

4581
02:26:20,170 --> 02:26:21,410
Guys, guys.

4582
02:26:21,510 --> 02:26:22,350
Oh, I'm stuck.

4583
02:26:22,450 --> 02:26:22,950
Okay, never mind.

4584
02:26:23,330 --> 02:26:25,150
Oh, look at all this lore.

4585
02:26:29,510 --> 02:26:30,830
Okay, read it out loud.

4586
02:26:31,070 --> 02:26:32,010
Where's the lore?

4587
02:26:32,090 --> 02:26:32,330
Come on.

4588
02:26:32,630 --> 02:26:33,890
All right, I got a book too.

4589
02:26:34,750 --> 02:26:35,630
Oh my god.

4590
02:26:35,630 --> 02:26:40,090
The Stanford Operating Procedure for Handling Hazardous Chemicals.

4591
02:26:40,110 --> 02:26:41,970
Oh, are you ready for some science?

4592
02:26:42,410 --> 02:26:43,610
I put the book down.

4593
02:26:44,030 --> 02:26:44,510
What the...

4594
02:26:44,510 --> 02:26:46,970
This is my fourth time going through the same hallway.

4595
02:26:50,890 --> 02:26:53,090
There's just blood on the ground and a bullet.

4596
02:26:53,610 --> 02:26:54,150
Let's see.

4597
02:26:55,290 --> 02:26:56,170
It says...

4598
02:26:56,170 --> 02:26:57,590
Oh, it says, hi.

4599
02:26:58,130 --> 02:26:58,570
Hi.

4600
02:26:59,090 --> 02:27:00,470
Oh, I just saw Alex die.

4601
02:27:00,890 --> 02:27:01,450
Wait, what?

4602
02:27:02,190 --> 02:27:03,190
No, it's not really him.

4603
02:27:03,250 --> 02:27:03,850
I'm hallucinating.

4604
02:27:03,850 --> 02:27:04,210
Oh, okay.

4605
02:27:04,330 --> 02:27:05,010
Okay, that's good.

4606
02:27:06,010 --> 02:27:06,710
I guess...

4607
02:27:06,710 --> 02:27:08,690
Because we only wanted Brad to die.

4608
02:27:09,270 --> 02:27:10,110
Oh my god.

4609
02:27:11,270 --> 02:27:14,330
I fucked it up, but like, I'm pretty sure you can take it home.

4610
02:27:15,410 --> 02:27:17,330
Brad, you take Brad's demo.

4611
02:27:17,470 --> 02:27:18,670
You had every opportunity.

4612
02:27:20,970 --> 02:27:22,110
I was panicking.

4613
02:27:22,630 --> 02:27:24,150
Oh, oh, that was a quick time event.

4614
02:27:24,190 --> 02:27:24,470
My bad.

4615
02:27:24,630 --> 02:27:24,930
Uh oh.

4616
02:27:25,050 --> 02:27:25,370
Oh.

4617
02:27:25,950 --> 02:27:26,710
Oh, I might...

4618
02:27:26,710 --> 02:27:27,590
He might actually die.

4619
02:27:27,770 --> 02:27:27,990
Oh.

4620
02:27:29,070 --> 02:27:29,510
Wait.

4621
02:27:29,790 --> 02:27:31,050
Did you actually kill him?

4622
02:27:31,610 --> 02:27:34,670
I was adjusting the sound and I missed the quick time.

4623
02:27:34,790 --> 02:27:35,610
No, he's fine.

4624
02:27:35,670 --> 02:27:35,950
He's fine.

4625
02:27:35,970 --> 02:27:36,290
Oh, okay.

4626
02:27:36,410 --> 02:27:36,670
Okay.

4627
02:27:37,190 --> 02:27:39,010
You can't die from a hallucination.

4628
02:27:39,850 --> 02:27:40,970
Okay, this is...

4629
02:27:41,870 --> 02:27:42,710
What just happened?

4630
02:27:42,970 --> 02:27:43,410
I don't know.

4631
02:27:45,750 --> 02:27:46,230
Okay, this is bad.

4632
02:27:46,230 --> 02:27:46,470
What?

4633
02:27:46,710 --> 02:27:47,490
Uh, you guys.

4634
02:27:48,730 --> 02:27:49,210
No!

4635
02:27:49,290 --> 02:27:50,190
We're in a different hallway now.

4636
02:27:50,250 --> 02:27:50,830
We made it out!

4637
02:27:51,570 --> 02:27:52,750
I can't believe it.

4638
02:27:52,770 --> 02:27:54,210
You were given one quick time.

4639
02:27:54,250 --> 02:27:57,250
I had to do like 20 during that entire run!

4640
02:27:58,150 --> 02:27:58,630
You...

4641
02:27:58,630 --> 02:28:02,470
And you get one quick time event and you messed it up.

4642
02:28:02,670 --> 02:28:04,330
I was adjusting my sound.

4643
02:28:04,510 --> 02:28:05,590
Now it's just so loud.

4644
02:28:08,150 --> 02:28:08,950
It's fine.

4645
02:28:10,710 --> 02:28:12,050
Don't worry about it.

4646
02:28:12,190 --> 02:28:13,310
Just worry about yourself.

4647
02:28:13,650 --> 02:28:14,470
Why are you so obsessed with yourself?

4648
02:28:14,490 --> 02:28:19,450
I feel like something's gonna come out now.

4649
02:28:25,530 --> 02:28:26,670
Where do I go?

4650
02:28:28,910 --> 02:28:30,470
I don't even know where to go.

4651
02:28:30,510 --> 02:28:31,170
It's over here.

4652
02:28:31,210 --> 02:28:31,750
Where do I go?

4653
02:28:33,750 --> 02:28:34,590
I'm stuck.

4654
02:28:41,010 --> 02:28:43,670
It really is, because I don't know what to do right now.

4655
02:28:44,830 --> 02:28:46,010
Patrol vehicle.

4656
02:28:49,210 --> 02:28:51,150
Oh, there's the...

4657
02:28:51,150 --> 02:28:55,190
Is this here?

4658
02:28:56,230 --> 02:28:56,970
What?

4659
02:29:01,050 --> 02:29:05,690
Oh my god, I'm going crazy.

4660
02:29:05,890 --> 02:29:07,870
You found a secret, but I'm going crazy.

4661
02:29:10,230 --> 02:29:14,430
I mean, Bradley's been pretty crazy this whole time.

4662
02:29:14,490 --> 02:29:15,070
So like...

4663
02:29:16,390 --> 02:29:17,790
Oh, I found a wrench!

4664
02:29:18,050 --> 02:29:18,830
Oh my god.

4665
02:29:18,970 --> 02:29:19,930
Take that, take that.

4666
02:29:19,990 --> 02:29:21,150
We're back to the ballroom.

4667
02:29:21,650 --> 02:29:22,930
Take that, take that.

4668
02:29:23,090 --> 02:29:23,430
Yes!

4669
02:29:23,530 --> 02:29:24,410
Oh, that's the wrench!

4670
02:29:24,450 --> 02:29:25,450
I found that wrench earlier!

4671
02:29:26,050 --> 02:29:27,470
Wait, next to the guy that was hanging?

4672
02:29:27,710 --> 02:29:27,990
Yeah.

4673
02:29:28,050 --> 02:29:28,990
Okay, wait, what?

4674
02:29:30,550 --> 02:29:31,910
Next to the guy that hung himself?

4675
02:29:32,230 --> 02:29:33,210
Um, he was...

4676
02:29:33,210 --> 02:29:35,650
There was no hung person when I was there.

4677
02:29:38,030 --> 02:29:39,510
Are you sure?

4678
02:29:40,610 --> 02:29:42,630
Yeah, I'm... I'm pretty sure.

4679
02:29:43,630 --> 02:29:44,350
Who are you?

4680
02:29:44,350 --> 02:29:45,010
Are you sure?

4681
02:29:47,410 --> 02:29:47,810
Yeah...

4682
02:29:50,810 --> 02:29:51,330
That's sad.

4683
02:29:52,170 --> 02:29:54,710
Oh, the tiniest A button I've ever seen in my entire life.

4684
02:29:56,150 --> 02:29:57,070
Wait, what's going on?

4685
02:29:57,230 --> 02:29:57,750
Oh, there.

4686
02:29:57,970 --> 02:29:58,490
Press A.

4687
02:29:58,690 --> 02:30:02,790
Okay, I'm gonna head outside to the deck again and see if I can get out again.

4688
02:30:03,230 --> 02:30:04,050
Oh, press A.

4689
02:30:04,070 --> 02:30:04,570
Oh, please.

4690
02:30:04,570 --> 02:30:05,530
Oh, I think I'm trying the door.

4691
02:30:05,930 --> 02:30:06,950
I'm gonna go outside.

4692
02:30:08,570 --> 02:30:09,410
You're going outside?

4693
02:30:09,870 --> 02:30:10,710
Yeah, I'm going back outside.

4694
02:30:11,030 --> 02:30:12,250
I go outside again!

4695
02:30:14,350 --> 02:30:14,510
What the hell happened?

4696
02:30:17,450 --> 02:30:18,290
I'm outside!

4697
02:30:18,830 --> 02:30:20,090
The outside is real!

4698
02:30:20,630 --> 02:30:20,850
It's an old boat, Bradley.

4699
02:30:22,930 --> 02:30:24,590
It's an old boat, Bradley.

4700
02:30:25,230 --> 02:30:26,150
Chill out.

4701
02:30:27,550 --> 02:30:28,870
Okay, I'm going downstairs.

4702
02:30:29,030 --> 02:30:29,210
Oh!

4703
02:30:30,850 --> 02:30:34,990
When you go outside, you... you... it makes you go back inside.

4704
02:30:35,810 --> 02:30:37,610
Oh, so he'll PT, PT.

4705
02:30:38,090 --> 02:30:38,690
Yeah.

4706
02:30:39,030 --> 02:30:40,290
Wait, I'm back here!

4707
02:30:42,510 --> 02:30:43,150
Here we go.

4708
02:30:44,130 --> 02:30:45,530
Oh, you cannot see the bottom.

4709
02:30:45,690 --> 02:30:46,270
Oh boy.

4710
02:30:46,390 --> 02:30:46,770
Oh boy.

4711
02:30:47,490 --> 02:30:48,590
Bradley, you're gonna die.

4712
02:30:48,730 --> 02:30:49,610
You're gonna die, Bradley.

4713
02:30:49,770 --> 02:30:49,890
Ah!

4714
02:30:50,490 --> 02:30:50,890
What?

4715
02:30:51,910 --> 02:30:52,610
What's going on?

4716
02:30:53,410 --> 02:30:55,330
Oh, I think I'm... I'm fine, actually.

4717
02:30:55,730 --> 02:30:56,130
Oh!

4718
02:30:57,790 --> 02:30:59,230
Oh, you dropped a wrench.

4719
02:31:00,550 --> 02:31:02,090
No, don't drop the wrench!

4720
02:31:02,170 --> 02:31:03,310
We worked so hard for that!

4721
02:31:03,870 --> 02:31:05,510
What was the point of all of that?

4722
02:31:06,290 --> 02:31:07,190
Brad, is that you?

4723
02:31:07,570 --> 02:31:09,450
Oh, I'm seeing shadow people.

4724
02:31:09,450 --> 02:31:10,150
Uh-oh.

4725
02:31:10,190 --> 02:31:11,270
Brad, is that you?

4726
02:31:12,050 --> 02:31:13,710
No, wait, is that... do you see me?

4727
02:31:13,810 --> 02:31:14,250
Oh no!

4728
02:31:14,450 --> 02:31:15,430
I missed the cutscene!

4729
02:31:15,690 --> 02:31:17,150
I could kill Brad right now!

4730
02:31:18,130 --> 02:31:19,250
Wait, no, don't!

4731
02:31:19,290 --> 02:31:19,650
That's me!

4732
02:31:19,910 --> 02:31:20,450
That's me!

4733
02:31:21,370 --> 02:31:22,030
That's me!

4734
02:31:22,030 --> 02:31:23,090
Ben, don't you... that's me!

4735
02:31:23,330 --> 02:31:24,110
Don't kill him!

4736
02:31:24,270 --> 02:31:24,790
I'm gonna kill him.

4737
02:31:24,790 --> 02:31:25,270
I'm gonna kill him.

4738
02:31:25,350 --> 02:31:26,150
Brad, that's me!

4739
02:31:26,890 --> 02:31:27,610
You're a zombie!

4740
02:31:27,630 --> 02:31:28,630
No, is that you?

4741
02:31:28,950 --> 02:31:29,270
That's me!

4742
02:31:29,350 --> 02:31:29,870
Don't do it!

4743
02:31:29,930 --> 02:31:30,710
That's literally me!

4744
02:31:31,090 --> 02:31:31,930
Do not!

4745
02:31:32,050 --> 02:31:32,570
Do not!

4746
02:31:34,870 --> 02:31:35,910
Wait, there's multiple!

4747
02:31:36,370 --> 02:31:38,050
There's like five zombies here!

4748
02:31:38,470 --> 02:31:38,690
No!

4749
02:31:38,690 --> 02:31:39,390
There's nothing!

4750
02:31:39,690 --> 02:31:40,510
There's no listening!

4751
02:31:40,670 --> 02:31:41,370
Don't do anything!

4752
02:31:44,750 --> 02:31:47,730
I almost bashed your head in, I'm serious.

4753
02:31:48,770 --> 02:31:50,210
God damn it!

4754
02:31:54,250 --> 02:31:56,930
Wait, who were you playing as, Bliss?

4755
02:31:57,210 --> 02:31:58,730
I think so.

4756
02:31:59,450 --> 02:32:02,290
Holy shit, you almost bashed my head!

4757
02:32:02,290 --> 02:32:03,350
I almost killed you.

4758
02:32:03,370 --> 02:32:04,530
I almost did.

4759
02:32:04,530 --> 02:32:06,070
It's because you begged for it.

4760
02:32:06,070 --> 02:32:07,570
Oh my god, the guy is right behind us!

4761
02:32:07,590 --> 02:32:08,150
Oh shit!

4762
02:32:11,430 --> 02:32:13,530
You like huffed it over my head!

4763
02:32:13,670 --> 02:32:16,330
You're like, hmm, do I do this?

4764
02:32:23,110 --> 02:32:25,030
Oh, wait, are you Alex, right?

4765
02:32:25,470 --> 02:32:26,230
I think so.

4766
02:32:26,610 --> 02:32:27,870
Wait, I got pulled up.

4767
02:32:27,970 --> 02:32:29,290
What do you see in the water?

4768
02:32:30,570 --> 02:32:32,330
I don't know, I got pulled out now.

4769
02:32:32,930 --> 02:32:34,010
I saw a baby.

4770
02:32:34,590 --> 02:32:35,510
Or I'm in the plane!

4771
02:32:35,510 --> 02:32:35,870
Whoa!

4772
02:32:38,930 --> 02:32:39,790
Oh, he's a...

4773
02:32:39,790 --> 02:32:40,550
Oh my god!

4774
02:32:40,670 --> 02:32:41,350
There's a zombie!

4775
02:32:42,330 --> 02:32:43,170
There's a zombie!

4776
02:32:44,030 --> 02:32:44,510
Oh!

4777
02:32:45,210 --> 02:32:46,430
Kill the zombie, kill the zombie!

4778
02:32:46,570 --> 02:32:47,590
I punched him, I punched him!

4779
02:32:50,110 --> 02:32:51,510
I think Julia's gonna drown.

4780
02:32:51,750 --> 02:32:52,930
Wait, you're Julia.

4781
02:32:53,450 --> 02:32:54,170
Yeah, I know.

4782
02:32:57,510 --> 02:33:03,050
I did everything I was supposed to do!

4783
02:33:03,490 --> 02:33:04,450
Oh, no, I'm fine.

4784
02:33:04,570 --> 02:33:05,110
Oh, hello.

4785
02:33:05,230 --> 02:33:05,490
You still got me.

4786
02:33:05,490 --> 02:33:06,210
You seem really calm.

4787
02:33:06,350 --> 02:33:08,450
Okay, I have to help you now.

4788
02:33:09,290 --> 02:33:10,950
Wait, there's multiple of you!

4789
02:33:11,130 --> 02:33:12,090
What just happened?

4790
02:33:14,790 --> 02:33:16,150
Wait, what's going on?

4791
02:33:16,170 --> 02:33:16,950
It's all just black.

4792
02:33:17,370 --> 02:33:18,450
What do you mean?

4793
02:33:18,590 --> 02:33:20,130
I clearly saved your life!

4794
02:33:20,790 --> 02:33:22,030
I couldn't say anything!

4795
02:33:22,550 --> 02:33:24,050
Oh, this is the premonition!

4796
02:33:26,710 --> 02:33:27,510
What's going on?

4797
02:33:27,730 --> 02:33:28,450
Who do I save?

4798
02:33:28,450 --> 02:33:29,210
Do I do it?

4799
02:33:29,290 --> 02:33:30,490
Wait, who do I save?

4800
02:33:31,110 --> 02:33:31,870
Do I do it?

4801
02:33:31,870 --> 02:33:32,330
I'm heroic!

4802
02:33:33,270 --> 02:33:34,930
What do you mean, who do you save?

4803
02:33:34,990 --> 02:33:35,450
If you're gonna save me, then you're gonna save me.

4804
02:33:35,450 --> 02:33:35,470
Wait, what?

4805
02:33:35,470 --> 02:33:36,750
That's literally my choice!

4806
02:33:36,910 --> 02:33:38,330
What are you doing?

4807
02:33:40,190 --> 02:33:41,630
Keep going!

4808
02:33:43,130 --> 02:33:44,750
Oh my god!

4809
02:33:45,470 --> 02:33:45,670
What?

4810
02:33:45,930 --> 02:33:47,390
Holy shit!

4811
02:33:47,730 --> 02:33:48,050
Man!

4812
02:33:49,070 --> 02:33:50,910
You made me kill a man!

4813
02:33:51,390 --> 02:33:52,210
I didn't kill a man!

4814
02:33:53,790 --> 02:33:55,450
Wait, was it you who died?

4815
02:33:55,850 --> 02:33:56,250
No!

4816
02:33:56,270 --> 02:33:56,790
Was?

4817
02:33:59,610 --> 02:34:02,810
You really made me kill a man!

4818
02:34:03,870 --> 02:34:05,450
You were already worried about me.

4819
02:34:05,450 --> 02:34:06,110
I was working on it!

4820
02:34:06,950 --> 02:34:11,450
I was making sure he beat, not actually kill him!

4821
02:34:13,830 --> 02:34:14,750
Do it!

4822
02:34:14,910 --> 02:34:15,730
Do it!

4823
02:34:18,790 --> 02:34:19,890
You were the one.

4824
02:34:19,950 --> 02:34:21,210
You could have let go at any time.

4825
02:34:32,290 --> 02:34:34,450
You made me kill a person.

4826
02:34:34,850 --> 02:34:36,110
You could have stopped me.

4827
02:34:36,130 --> 02:34:37,770
I don't have any control over you.

4828
02:34:38,550 --> 02:34:39,390
You did the right thing.

4829
02:34:39,590 --> 02:34:40,750
Yeah, you did the right thing.

4830
02:34:42,650 --> 02:34:43,490
What the?

4831
02:34:43,750 --> 02:34:44,730
What the fuck?

4832
02:34:48,090 --> 02:34:49,470
How did he get thrown away?

4833
02:34:49,630 --> 02:34:51,750
What the fuck?

4834
02:34:51,770 --> 02:34:52,790
I told you there's zombies!

4835
02:34:54,130 --> 02:34:54,550
Oh my god, it's him!

4836
02:34:55,050 --> 02:34:55,650
What the?

4837
02:34:57,170 --> 02:34:58,010
What is going on?

4838
02:34:58,170 --> 02:34:58,470
What the?

4839
02:34:58,550 --> 02:34:59,290
Oh my god.

4840
02:34:59,410 --> 02:34:59,990
What's going on?

4841
02:35:00,770 --> 02:35:01,990
Oh my god, punch him!

4842
02:35:02,490 --> 02:35:03,070
Punch him!

4843
02:35:03,190 --> 02:35:03,810
Do something!

4844
02:35:04,690 --> 02:35:05,450
Oh my god, run!

4845
02:35:05,990 --> 02:35:07,270
Are we doing anything?

4846
02:35:08,550 --> 02:35:09,290
Quick time event.

4847
02:35:10,330 --> 02:35:11,250
Who is he?

4848
02:35:12,390 --> 02:35:14,110
That's the guy that had the hammer, right?

4849
02:35:14,250 --> 02:35:15,050
That's the hammer guy?

4850
02:35:15,330 --> 02:35:16,730
Why does he look pruney?

4851
02:35:17,590 --> 02:35:18,030
Yeah.

4852
02:35:18,030 --> 02:35:18,690
He was in the water.

4853
02:35:21,090 --> 02:35:22,150
It's John Madan.

4854
02:35:22,990 --> 02:35:24,470
Oh my god, it's Madan!

4855
02:35:24,770 --> 02:35:26,130
It's the man of Madan!

4856
02:35:27,290 --> 02:35:27,950
Oh my god.

4857
02:35:28,010 --> 02:35:28,490
Hey, stop.

4858
02:35:28,610 --> 02:35:29,650
Don't mess up your QTE.

4859
02:35:29,830 --> 02:35:30,950
You can't trip on the stairs.

4860
02:35:32,850 --> 02:35:33,290
Fuck.

4861
02:35:33,290 --> 02:35:33,870
Uh oh.

4862
02:35:33,970 --> 02:35:34,530
Come on, Julia.

4863
02:35:35,690 --> 02:35:36,210
Hit it.

4864
02:35:39,750 --> 02:35:42,590
I'm going to get you from bonds.

4865
02:35:42,670 --> 02:35:42,790
Uh oh.

4866
02:35:42,790 --> 02:35:43,930
Uh oh.

4867
02:35:45,610 --> 02:35:46,770
We killed daddy.

4868
02:35:48,750 --> 02:35:49,730
I hope-.

4869
02:35:49,890 --> 02:35:50,590
Oh my god, you did it!

4870
02:35:50,710 --> 02:35:52,390
Oh my god, I'm so proud of you!

4871
02:35:56,690 --> 02:35:57,570
Holy shit.

4872
02:35:57,790 --> 02:35:58,530
I'm so proud of you!

4873
02:35:58,530 --> 02:36:04,010
This is the most quick time event I've ever- I'm actually proud of you.

4874
02:36:04,010 --> 02:36:04,550
Which way do we go?

4875
02:36:04,550 --> 02:36:05,730
I don't know, I don't know.

4876
02:36:05,810 --> 02:36:06,970
Are you deciding or am I deciding?

4877
02:36:07,450 --> 02:36:08,110
I don't know!

4878
02:36:09,410 --> 02:36:09,810
Ah!

4879
02:36:10,910 --> 02:36:12,030
Jump, jump, jump!

4880
02:36:12,210 --> 02:36:14,010
Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump!

4881
02:36:14,070 --> 02:36:14,470
Shit.

4882
02:36:15,950 --> 02:36:16,470
Let's jump.

4883
02:36:16,930 --> 02:36:17,350
We're correct.

4884
02:36:17,570 --> 02:36:17,710
Ah!

4885
02:36:17,910 --> 02:36:19,150
Oh, my bad.

4886
02:36:19,250 --> 02:36:19,530
It's okay.

4887
02:36:19,610 --> 02:36:19,930
Okay.

4888
02:36:20,310 --> 02:36:22,490
Um, maybe we sh...

4889
02:36:22,490 --> 02:36:22,930
Just to help me out.

4890
02:36:22,930 --> 02:36:23,170
Okay.

4891
02:36:23,990 --> 02:36:25,970
Maybe we shouldn't have jumped.

4892
02:36:28,370 --> 02:36:29,250
I pressed Y, but I also pressed...

4893
02:36:29,250 --> 02:36:29,710
Fight back or keep going.

4894
02:36:29,810 --> 02:36:30,670
Fight back or keep going.

4895
02:36:30,750 --> 02:36:31,010
Which one?

4896
02:36:31,070 --> 02:36:31,290
Which one?

4897
02:36:32,190 --> 02:36:32,810
Keep going!

4898
02:36:32,910 --> 02:36:33,310
Fight on!

4899
02:36:33,310 --> 02:36:33,990
I zipped my back!

4900
02:36:34,230 --> 02:36:34,250
Oh!

4901
02:36:34,730 --> 02:36:35,350
Oh, okay!

4902
02:36:36,110 --> 02:36:36,650
That's fine.

4903
02:36:37,670 --> 02:36:39,050
You're gonna kill a second man.

4904
02:36:39,150 --> 02:36:40,030
You're obsessed with it.

4905
02:36:40,890 --> 02:36:41,810
Oh, my God!

4906
02:36:41,870 --> 02:36:42,250
I did it!

4907
02:36:42,270 --> 02:36:42,770
I'm a hero!

4908
02:36:48,270 --> 02:36:48,630
Bulk.

4909
02:36:52,190 --> 02:36:52,890
Oh, my God.

4910
02:36:52,930 --> 02:36:53,310
Keep going.

4911
02:36:53,490 --> 02:36:54,070
Oh, we're outside.

4912
02:36:55,750 --> 02:36:56,330
Oh, my God.

4913
02:36:56,370 --> 02:36:56,730
Bulk!

4914
02:36:56,730 --> 02:36:57,230
Oh, my God!

4915
02:36:57,870 --> 02:36:58,590
I'm a hero!

4916
02:37:01,270 --> 02:37:02,430
You're killing him!

4917
02:37:03,990 --> 02:37:04,490
Oh, my God!

4918
02:37:04,490 --> 02:37:05,330
I'm blood fursie!

4919
02:37:06,670 --> 02:37:07,170
This is a Maison.

4920
02:37:07,250 --> 02:37:08,190
This is a prison!

4921
02:37:08,730 --> 02:37:09,510
What are we doing?

4922
02:37:09,570 --> 02:37:10,150
How do you save him?

4923
02:37:10,490 --> 02:37:11,830
Oh, my God.

4924
02:37:12,250 --> 02:37:12,950
It's Fleece.

4925
02:37:13,330 --> 02:37:13,330
Oh, my God.

4926
02:37:13,330 --> 02:37:14,170
It's Fleece.

4927
02:37:14,190 --> 02:37:14,830
Yeah, it's me.

4928
02:37:14,930 --> 02:37:15,210
Come on.

4929
02:37:15,210 --> 02:37:15,530
Let's go.

4930
02:37:15,830 --> 02:37:16,770
Where's Bradley?

4931
02:37:16,970 --> 02:37:17,970
Oh, my God!

4932
02:37:18,150 --> 02:37:18,350
He's alive!

4933
02:37:18,470 --> 02:37:18,570
Are you guys okay?

4934
02:37:19,590 --> 02:37:20,310
Everybody's alive!

4935
02:37:20,630 --> 02:37:20,950
We're alive!

4936
02:37:21,530 --> 02:37:21,710
Oh, my God.

4937
02:37:21,710 --> 02:37:21,710
You're doing it!

4938
02:37:21,710 --> 02:37:22,090
We're doing it!

4939
02:37:22,330 --> 02:37:25,950
We're supposed to kill people, but somehow it's working.

4940
02:37:29,570 --> 02:37:31,390
Wait, but was Bradley alive?

4941
02:37:32,790 --> 02:37:33,290
Oh!

4942
02:37:33,290 --> 02:37:34,930
We're too good at the game, I think.

4943
02:37:39,710 --> 02:37:40,790
Oh my god.

4944
02:37:41,030 --> 02:37:41,990
Keep going, keep going.

4945
02:37:43,690 --> 02:37:44,570
Murder works?

4946
02:37:50,430 --> 02:37:52,450
I think... yeah.

4947
02:37:52,570 --> 02:37:53,730
I think we'll be alright here.

4948
02:37:54,230 --> 02:37:54,670
Okay.

4949
02:37:55,130 --> 02:37:55,390
Okay.

4950
02:37:57,770 --> 02:37:58,210
What?

4951
02:37:58,350 --> 02:37:59,190
Why do you think that?

4952
02:37:59,250 --> 02:38:00,330
I don't trust you, Bradley.

4953
02:38:00,330 --> 02:38:00,630
Bradley?

4954
02:38:00,630 --> 02:38:03,450
Bradley, you almost killed Fliss!

4955
02:38:04,690 --> 02:38:07,510
I think he's just as surprised that everybody's alive.

4956
02:38:11,250 --> 02:38:11,890
Yeah.

4957
02:38:12,170 --> 02:38:12,430
Yeah.

4958
02:38:12,750 --> 02:38:13,010
That's kinda crazy.

4959
02:38:14,250 --> 02:38:16,470
I didn't see so many dead people.

4960
02:38:16,750 --> 02:38:17,870
Kinda disappointed in that.

4961
02:38:18,410 --> 02:38:19,850
Why do we meet?

4962
02:38:20,210 --> 02:38:21,670
You hadn't saw them come alive!

4963
02:38:22,890 --> 02:38:23,530
Apparently.

4964
02:38:24,750 --> 02:38:25,390
No.

4965
02:38:30,350 --> 02:38:31,290
Did we just leave?

4966
02:38:31,650 --> 02:38:32,630
Yeah, we just leave!

4967
02:38:32,770 --> 02:38:32,970
Yeah, just leave!

4968
02:38:39,810 --> 02:38:43,690
The whole ship died, right?

4969
02:38:44,510 --> 02:38:44,910
Yeah.

4970
02:38:45,110 --> 02:38:45,790
Let me help you out.

4971
02:38:45,970 --> 02:38:47,070
I watched Ghost Ship.

4972
02:38:47,170 --> 02:38:48,430
Oh boy, another hint.

4973
02:38:48,630 --> 02:38:48,910
Okay.

4974
02:38:49,370 --> 02:38:50,230
Yeah, I would do two.

4975
02:38:50,610 --> 02:38:51,690
Yeah, I need some help.

4976
02:38:51,790 --> 02:38:51,930
Yeah.

4977
02:38:52,290 --> 02:38:52,690
Yeah.

4978
02:38:52,870 --> 02:38:53,650
Give me a hint, man.

4979
02:38:53,690 --> 02:38:54,810
I don't want spoilers.

4980
02:38:54,810 --> 02:38:54,930
I don't want spoilers.

4981
02:38:56,330 --> 02:39:02,030
Well, then how can I put this?

4982
02:39:02,170 --> 02:39:06,910
There may be forces at play here that are more scientific.

4983
02:39:07,190 --> 02:39:07,870
Scientific?

4984
02:39:08,530 --> 02:39:11,670
Even some that are more political, you know?

4985
02:39:11,710 --> 02:39:13,890
Less supernatural.

4986
02:39:14,590 --> 02:39:14,990
What?

4987
02:39:16,870 --> 02:39:19,350
Perhaps you've started to realize...

4988
02:39:19,350 --> 02:39:22,350
His facial expressions!

4989
02:39:26,330 --> 02:39:26,810
Right?

4990
02:39:26,810 --> 02:39:29,470
3, 2, 5, 2, K... What the fuck does that mean?

4991
02:39:29,910 --> 02:39:30,590
Oh, they're all kings!

4992
02:39:32,090 --> 02:39:33,430
What does that mean?

4993
02:39:33,730 --> 02:39:34,050
What?

4994
02:39:34,150 --> 02:39:34,990
That doesn't help anything!

4995
02:39:38,590 --> 02:39:39,790
I get it.

4996
02:39:40,210 --> 02:39:40,950
Is this a gas?

4997
02:39:41,510 --> 02:39:42,670
Yeah, it's all gas.

4998
02:39:43,010 --> 02:39:43,350
It's not...

4999
02:39:44,470 --> 02:39:45,390
It's not supernatural.

5000
02:39:46,070 --> 02:39:46,710
It's the gas.

5001
02:39:46,730 --> 02:39:48,330
We're hallucinating because of the gases.

5002
02:39:48,850 --> 02:39:49,330
Yeah.

5003
02:39:49,330 --> 02:39:53,810
The more we're inside, the more we're getting hallucinations.

5004
02:39:54,410 --> 02:39:55,390
Gas, gas, gas.

5005
02:39:55,950 --> 02:39:57,430
I don't think we should go back inside.

5006
02:39:57,910 --> 02:39:58,010
Come on, Alex.

5007
02:39:58,010 --> 02:39:58,170
You're Julia.

5008
02:39:58,450 --> 02:39:58,750
Okay.

5009
02:39:59,030 --> 02:39:59,450
Alright.

5010
02:40:00,010 --> 02:40:01,750
What the hell was wrong with you back there?

5011
02:40:03,530 --> 02:40:04,590
I don't know, Mitt.

5012
02:40:04,670 --> 02:40:05,950
You almost bashed my head.

5013
02:40:08,750 --> 02:40:09,510
That's ridiculous.

5014
02:40:09,730 --> 02:40:10,010
That's ridiculous.

5015
02:40:10,570 --> 02:40:12,630
What the fuck is going on with this ship?

5016
02:40:12,750 --> 02:40:13,750
We're seeing dead people.

5017
02:40:13,830 --> 02:40:15,850
I gotta be honest, it feels like there's some like...

5018
02:40:15,850 --> 02:40:17,010
Like evil.

5019
02:40:17,170 --> 02:40:19,310
Like literal evil going on down there.

5020
02:40:19,330 --> 02:40:23,290
Let's just stay calm and relatively sane about this, okay?

5021
02:40:24,090 --> 02:40:25,670
The stuff I saw...

5022
02:40:26,210 --> 02:40:27,870
It's like there were these old soldiers.

5023
02:40:28,010 --> 02:40:28,830
They were bodies.

5024
02:40:28,970 --> 02:40:29,490
They were dead.

5025
02:40:29,610 --> 02:40:31,370
But then they came alive and...

5026
02:40:31,370 --> 02:40:35,270
That doesn't sound that crazy right about now.

5027
02:40:35,750 --> 02:40:36,990
Alex wasn't the only Alex.

5028
02:40:37,970 --> 02:40:39,730
Alex wasn't the only Alex.

5029
02:40:40,050 --> 02:40:40,290
Alex wasn't the only Alex.

5030
02:40:41,490 --> 02:40:42,830
That's why I was confused!

5031
02:40:44,770 --> 02:40:47,110
That's like, what do you mean Alex wasn't the only Alex?

5032
02:40:47,750 --> 02:40:48,270
Um...

5033
02:40:48,270 --> 02:40:49,730
Wait, what are you deciding?

5034
02:40:49,850 --> 02:40:50,770
I wouldn't hurt you.

5035
02:40:54,510 --> 02:40:55,630
I'm truthful.

5036
02:40:58,170 --> 02:40:59,950
Oh, relationship went up!

5037
02:41:00,010 --> 02:41:00,610
We're fixing it!

5038
02:41:00,970 --> 02:41:01,910
We're fixing it!

5039
02:41:01,910 --> 02:41:03,390
We're fixing your mess!

5040
02:41:04,670 --> 02:41:05,530
No, your!

5041
02:41:05,850 --> 02:41:07,370
No, their prior mess.

5042
02:41:07,470 --> 02:41:08,650
They had a mess already.

5043
02:41:09,330 --> 02:41:11,550
We're just making it better, you know?

5044
02:41:15,250 --> 02:41:17,150
Is this a ghost ship?

5045
02:41:18,270 --> 02:41:20,170
Am I crazy or are we on a ghost ship?

5046
02:41:20,250 --> 02:41:25,190
Like ghost ships are real and this is one and we're totally on it and oh holy shit we're so totally fucked?

5047
02:41:26,330 --> 02:41:27,810
I was gonna say the same thing.

5048
02:41:28,010 --> 02:41:28,310
Yeah!

5049
02:41:28,490 --> 02:41:29,490
I'm not crazy!

5050
02:41:29,910 --> 02:41:31,350
I know we're the first people to see weird shit here.

5051
02:41:31,490 --> 02:41:35,690
Apparently the guards were super freaked out by something they saw in the cargo holds.

5052
02:41:36,010 --> 02:41:36,450
Oooh.

5053
02:41:36,710 --> 02:41:41,310
That said a bunch of guys tried to get out of a guard duty because they were really freaked out by something.

5054
02:41:41,910 --> 02:41:42,130
Yeah.

5055
02:41:42,430 --> 02:41:42,710
Oh.

5056
02:41:42,830 --> 02:41:46,410
Oh, there might be like bacteria on the gold that's eating our brains.

5057
02:41:47,030 --> 02:41:47,770
Oh yeah.

5058
02:41:47,770 --> 02:41:48,390
Oh, there might be bleeding bacteria.

5059
02:41:49,390 --> 02:41:51,230
Anyone figure out what happened to all the sailors?

5060
02:41:51,710 --> 02:41:53,710
Did they catch a rescue boat or something?

5061
02:41:53,930 --> 02:41:55,350
Oh, I mean we've seen their bodies though.

5062
02:41:55,470 --> 02:41:55,930
Yeah.

5063
02:41:56,750 --> 02:41:57,210
Shit.

5064
02:41:57,430 --> 02:41:58,950
So where did all the corpses come from?

5065
02:41:59,410 --> 02:42:01,990
They actually look like they've been scared to death.

5066
02:42:02,790 --> 02:42:03,470
Heart attack!

5067
02:42:03,790 --> 02:42:03,870
Ooh.

5068
02:42:04,150 --> 02:42:06,130
I am not gonna ask about the gold.

5069
02:42:06,330 --> 02:42:08,610
It keeps being like, ask about the gold.

5070
02:42:08,650 --> 02:42:10,270
I'm not gonna ask about the gold.

5071
02:42:10,490 --> 02:42:11,330
Why not?

5072
02:42:11,370 --> 02:42:11,850
Why not?

5073
02:42:12,050 --> 02:42:13,350
It's a cursed gold!

5074
02:42:14,130 --> 02:42:16,690
Literally our heads was like, don't be greedy.

5075
02:42:16,690 --> 02:42:18,910
No, it's fine.

5076
02:42:19,010 --> 02:42:20,390
Oh, I'll ask about the gold.

5077
02:42:20,450 --> 02:42:21,270
Don't worry about you.

5078
02:42:21,550 --> 02:42:24,550
Don't be greedy!

5079
02:42:27,790 --> 02:42:29,770
I'm avoiding the gold!

5080
02:42:33,870 --> 02:42:35,010
I got you.

5081
02:42:35,110 --> 02:42:35,570
I got you.

5082
02:42:35,630 --> 02:42:35,850
Don't worry.

5083
02:42:38,510 --> 02:42:40,510
You're not supposed to be greedy!

5084
02:42:40,930 --> 02:42:41,330
I'm kidding.

5085
02:42:42,030 --> 02:42:43,310
I'm just wondering.

5086
02:42:43,570 --> 02:42:46,510
I'm just wondering what's wrong with being greedy.

5087
02:42:46,510 --> 02:42:46,610
I'm just wondering.

5088
02:42:46,610 --> 02:42:46,670
I'm just wondering what's wrong with being greedy.

5089
02:42:48,530 --> 02:42:50,690
We're not going anywhere without the destroyer cap.

5090
02:42:50,990 --> 02:42:52,130
The loop needs it to run.

5091
02:42:52,310 --> 02:42:53,470
Did you grab that though?

5092
02:42:53,530 --> 02:42:54,150
She grabbed it.

5093
02:42:54,170 --> 02:42:55,850
No, one of the captains grabbed it.

5094
02:42:56,330 --> 02:42:56,690
Oh.

5095
02:42:57,770 --> 02:42:59,330
If we can find it and use it.

5096
02:42:59,430 --> 02:43:00,050
Oh, it's working!

5097
02:43:00,530 --> 02:43:01,090
That's great.

5098
02:43:01,210 --> 02:43:02,430
Do you think it still works?

5099
02:43:02,630 --> 02:43:03,610
Yeah, but where's the radio?

5100
02:43:04,090 --> 02:43:04,970
It was blinking.

5101
02:43:05,190 --> 02:43:05,430
See?

5102
02:43:05,610 --> 02:43:08,090
I know that means the radio is on, but where's the radio station?

5103
02:43:08,530 --> 02:43:09,110
Over there?

5104
02:43:09,170 --> 02:43:09,930
Probably over there, right?

5105
02:43:10,010 --> 02:43:10,190
Yeah.

5106
02:43:10,570 --> 02:43:11,730
Wait, let... Oh, what the fuck?

5107
02:43:13,010 --> 02:43:13,710
Oh, okay.

5108
02:43:13,870 --> 02:43:14,290
Oh, okay.

5109
02:43:14,370 --> 02:43:14,950
Wait, who am I?

5110
02:43:15,010 --> 02:43:15,570
Oh, I'm Fliss.

5111
02:43:15,570 --> 02:43:15,870
I'm Fliss.

5112
02:43:15,870 --> 02:43:15,950
Okay.

5113
02:43:15,950 --> 02:43:16,470
Okay, I'm Alex.

5114
02:43:16,590 --> 02:43:17,570
Okay, before we start, wait.

5115
02:43:17,670 --> 02:43:18,230
I need to pause.

5116
02:43:18,370 --> 02:43:18,990
I need to use the bathroom.

5117
02:43:19,450 --> 02:43:19,930
Okay.

5118
02:43:19,930 --> 02:43:20,450
I'll be right back.

5119
02:43:20,790 --> 02:43:21,270
Okay.

5120
02:43:22,330 --> 02:43:24,670
Let's look at the collections and characters, everybody.

5121
02:43:25,430 --> 02:43:26,390
I'm Fliss.

5122
02:43:26,410 --> 02:43:27,350
I'm innocent.

5123
02:43:27,990 --> 02:43:28,910
I'm relaxed.

5124
02:43:29,370 --> 02:43:29,690
Oh.

5125
02:43:29,930 --> 02:43:30,410
Oh.

5126
02:43:30,510 --> 02:43:33,830
All of our... Oh my god, my relationship with Alex is insane.

5127
02:43:34,850 --> 02:43:36,710
I just watched it go all the way down.

5128
02:43:37,250 --> 02:43:39,110
Um, Brad is whatever.

5129
02:43:39,410 --> 02:43:40,570
Julia is pretty down.

5130
02:43:41,410 --> 02:43:42,370
Um, Conrad.

5131
02:43:42,490 --> 02:43:43,150
But I'm innocent.

5132
02:43:43,250 --> 02:43:43,870
I'm relaxed.

5133
02:43:43,950 --> 02:43:44,450
I'm excited.

5134
02:43:44,550 --> 02:43:45,210
I'm altruistic.

5135
02:43:45,310 --> 02:43:45,930
I'm garbed.

5136
02:43:45,950 --> 02:43:46,890
I'm motivated.

5137
02:43:47,410 --> 02:43:48,350
Oh my god.

5138
02:43:48,630 --> 02:43:49,210
What secrets?

5139
02:43:49,470 --> 02:43:49,630
Wow.

5140
02:43:50,110 --> 02:43:52,490
Oh, actually we haven't even found that many, have we?

5141
02:43:53,330 --> 02:43:53,970
What's this?

5142
02:43:54,950 --> 02:43:55,830
Flight plan.

5143
02:43:57,410 --> 02:43:58,130
Uh-huh.

5144
02:43:58,230 --> 02:43:58,990
Private Miller.

5145
02:43:59,110 --> 02:43:59,670
Master Miller.

5146
02:44:00,310 --> 02:44:01,350
Our bearings.

5147
02:44:01,870 --> 02:44:02,750
What are these?

5148
02:44:02,910 --> 02:44:03,970
The kitchen knife.

5149
02:44:04,790 --> 02:44:07,370
Oh, these are the hints that we've gotten, I think.

5150
02:44:07,650 --> 02:44:08,810
Yeah, these are the hints.

5151
02:44:10,290 --> 02:44:11,330
Our premonitions.

5152
02:44:13,410 --> 02:44:14,850
Cut of your jib.

5153
02:44:15,910 --> 02:44:17,590
In the offing.

5154
02:44:19,290 --> 02:44:20,810
High and dry.

5155
02:44:22,410 --> 02:44:23,230
Master Miller.

5156
02:44:23,510 --> 02:44:24,330
Yeah, Master Miller.

5157
02:44:25,670 --> 02:44:26,190
Let's see.

5158
02:44:26,310 --> 02:44:26,410
What?

5159
02:44:26,490 --> 02:44:26,910
Oh, whoops.

5160
02:44:26,970 --> 02:44:27,410
Uh...

5161
02:44:28,390 --> 02:44:34,250
Oh gosh, I'm so used to playing Japanese games where there's circles to press okay.

5162
02:44:34,450 --> 02:44:35,110
Oh my gosh.

5163
02:44:35,690 --> 02:44:36,650
Brian Carter.

5164
02:44:36,970 --> 02:44:37,430
I'm back.

5165
02:44:37,650 --> 02:44:38,670
Oh, welcome back.

5166
02:44:38,970 --> 02:44:39,210
Alright.

5167
02:44:39,370 --> 02:44:40,550
What did... What are you doing?

5168
02:44:40,990 --> 02:44:42,990
I was looking at our secrets.

5169
02:44:43,110 --> 02:44:44,830
Yeah, did we get some good secrets?

5170
02:44:44,830 --> 02:44:46,030
Oh yeah.

5171
02:44:46,250 --> 02:44:46,650
Oh.

5172
02:44:47,390 --> 02:44:50,150
I'm surprised we're making it this far.

5173
02:44:51,710 --> 02:44:52,150
Alright.

5174
02:44:52,250 --> 02:44:52,550
I'm ready.

5175
02:44:52,970 --> 02:44:53,410
Honestly.

5176
02:44:55,690 --> 02:44:56,130
Okay.

5177
02:44:56,250 --> 02:44:56,430
Alright.

5178
02:44:56,690 --> 02:44:57,870
Um, anything else in here?

5179
02:44:58,230 --> 02:44:58,750
I don't think so.

5180
02:44:58,750 --> 02:44:59,630
I think we're supposed to go outside.

5181
02:45:00,250 --> 02:45:03,190
The longer we stay inside, the more we inhale the gas.

5182
02:45:03,770 --> 02:45:04,390
You're right.

5183
02:45:04,430 --> 02:45:05,090
But we're outside.

5184
02:45:05,230 --> 02:45:05,770
It's fine.

5185
02:45:06,150 --> 02:45:08,310
Yeah, that's why we gotta stay in... outside now.

5186
02:45:08,530 --> 02:45:09,310
Totally effed.

5187
02:45:09,370 --> 02:45:10,590
Totally effed.

5188
02:45:10,630 --> 02:45:11,350
Oh my gosh.

5189
02:45:11,430 --> 02:45:12,470
We're so effed right now.

5190
02:45:12,470 --> 02:45:15,110
Why are you playing as Fliss and not my girlfriend?

5191
02:45:15,810 --> 02:45:16,450
Julia.

5192
02:45:17,070 --> 02:45:18,090
Yeah, I don't know.

5193
02:45:18,230 --> 02:45:22,170
I looked at our relationship.

5194
02:45:22,470 --> 02:45:24,950
Fliss' relationship with Alex is completely down.

5195
02:45:25,730 --> 02:45:28,210
What did you do?

5196
02:45:28,870 --> 02:45:30,290
What did I do?

5197
02:45:30,550 --> 02:45:33,190
You literally go like, Fliss go down there.

5198
02:45:33,550 --> 02:45:35,510
I've never been Fliss.

5199
02:45:37,210 --> 02:45:38,470
Fliss go down there.

5200
02:45:38,850 --> 02:45:39,270
What's this?

5201
02:45:40,350 --> 02:45:41,850
I'm gonna look at it.

5202
02:45:42,570 --> 02:45:43,650
I'm looking at it too.

5203
02:45:43,790 --> 02:45:44,170
I'm looking at it.

5204
02:45:46,950 --> 02:45:48,270
Oh, there's bullet holes there.

5205
02:45:49,530 --> 02:45:51,470
We can't use that.

5206
02:45:51,650 --> 02:45:52,890
We gotta go forward.

5207
02:45:53,210 --> 02:45:55,790
Oh yeah, he did accuse her of being in cahoots.

5208
02:45:55,790 --> 02:45:56,210
That's true.

5209
02:45:56,870 --> 02:45:58,350
Yeah, didn't you accuse me?

5210
02:45:58,850 --> 02:45:59,710
No, I didn't do that.

5211
02:45:59,830 --> 02:46:00,390
It was Alex.

5212
02:46:01,070 --> 02:46:02,850
You made the choices.

5213
02:46:04,110 --> 02:46:04,550
It was Alex.

5214
02:46:04,730 --> 02:46:06,890
Oh, we're finding a way up?

5215
02:46:06,990 --> 02:46:07,510
Is that what we're doing?

5216
02:46:07,710 --> 02:46:08,450
We have to find a way to get up.

5217
02:46:08,470 --> 02:46:09,350
We have to get to the radio tower.

5218
02:46:09,790 --> 02:46:11,430
Oh, I thought... okay.

5219
02:46:11,570 --> 02:46:12,810
I thought we had to just get over there.

5220
02:46:13,590 --> 02:46:14,210
Oh my gosh.

5221
02:46:14,250 --> 02:46:16,690
We're acting really casual for like, you know, some...

5222
02:46:16,690 --> 02:46:17,750
For like, you know...

5223
02:46:18,350 --> 02:46:19,870
For almost... for seeing...

5224
02:46:20,470 --> 02:46:21,310
several dead people.

5225
02:46:21,590 --> 02:46:22,850
And I killed a man.

5226
02:46:23,090 --> 02:46:24,030
I killed several men.

5227
02:46:24,490 --> 02:46:25,550
I found a way up.

5228
02:46:29,410 --> 02:46:30,950
I think this is our way up.

5229
02:46:31,270 --> 02:46:32,710
I mean, it's the only way up.

5230
02:46:34,070 --> 02:46:34,510
What?

5231
02:46:35,050 --> 02:46:35,930
Give you a...

5232
02:46:35,930 --> 02:46:38,570
Yeah, you're a strong, powerful woman.

5233
02:46:39,030 --> 02:46:40,050
Oh my god!

5234
02:46:40,070 --> 02:46:40,510
Damn!

5235
02:46:42,070 --> 02:46:43,550
Shouldn't it be me?

5236
02:46:43,890 --> 02:46:45,510
That gets to lift up?

5237
02:46:45,550 --> 02:46:46,250
Are you right?

5238
02:46:46,470 --> 02:46:47,010
Holy shit!

5239
02:46:48,170 --> 02:46:50,370
And he doesn't even help her get all the way up.

5240
02:46:50,370 --> 02:46:52,490
Yeah, he just pulls you a little bit.

5241
02:46:52,570 --> 02:46:53,290
I was like, alright.

5242
02:46:53,650 --> 02:46:54,910
I did my job.

5243
02:46:56,170 --> 02:46:57,030
I'm a gentleman.

5244
02:46:58,810 --> 02:46:59,970
Dang, she's strong.

5245
02:47:00,850 --> 02:47:01,490
Oh, we're back.

5246
02:47:01,610 --> 02:47:02,170
Oh, we're back.

5247
02:47:02,230 --> 02:47:03,030
Did no one help Brad?

5248
02:47:03,750 --> 02:47:05,130
No, there is a stander right there.

5249
02:47:05,230 --> 02:47:07,270
I know, I know, but no one helped him get up.

5250
02:47:07,350 --> 02:47:08,470
He just climbed up himself.

5251
02:47:09,250 --> 02:47:10,170
Brad, are you okay?

5252
02:47:10,210 --> 02:47:10,590
Oh yeah, I have to go talk to him.

5253
02:47:10,590 --> 02:47:11,070
You help him.

5254
02:47:11,950 --> 02:47:12,490
Come here, Brad.

5255
02:47:12,650 --> 02:47:13,510
You're gonna talk to him?

5256
02:47:13,630 --> 02:47:15,170
Bro, we gotta find the radio tower!

5257
02:47:16,390 --> 02:47:19,310
The longer we're here, the more we're inhaling the gas!

5258
02:47:19,910 --> 02:47:20,830
He doesn't care!

5259
02:47:21,450 --> 02:47:23,390
Okay, he really doesn't care about me.

5260
02:47:23,430 --> 02:47:24,550
He doesn't care about you.

5261
02:47:24,670 --> 02:47:26,490
You literally almost bashed your head.

5262
02:47:27,630 --> 02:47:29,370
Well, he almost bashed my head.

5263
02:47:29,430 --> 02:47:31,850
If anything, I shouldn't be wanting to talk to him.

5264
02:47:33,130 --> 02:47:34,170
Okay, we gotta split up maybe.

5265
02:47:34,170 --> 02:47:34,770
We gotta split up.

5266
02:47:34,770 --> 02:47:35,950
No, we're not splitting up.

5267
02:47:36,170 --> 02:47:37,070
Who's that down there?

5268
02:47:37,170 --> 02:47:37,610
Who's that?

5269
02:47:38,170 --> 02:47:39,050
There's someone down there.

5270
02:47:39,050 --> 02:47:40,090
There's someone down there.

5271
02:47:40,790 --> 02:47:41,850
No, no, no.

5272
02:47:41,910 --> 02:47:42,430
Over here.

5273
02:47:42,650 --> 02:47:42,770
No, no, no.

5274
02:47:42,770 --> 02:47:42,770
Over here.

5275
02:47:42,770 --> 02:47:43,410
Wait, there is.

5276
02:47:43,610 --> 02:47:44,190
Wait, you're right.

5277
02:47:44,330 --> 02:47:44,730
Who's that?

5278
02:47:45,230 --> 02:47:45,790
Who's that?

5279
02:47:45,830 --> 02:47:46,570
I'm going the other way.

5280
02:47:46,770 --> 02:47:47,170
Who's that?

5281
02:47:47,170 --> 02:47:47,830
I'm going the other way.

5282
02:47:47,850 --> 02:47:48,250
Who's that?

5283
02:47:48,330 --> 02:47:49,730
I told you this way was the better way.

5284
02:47:50,530 --> 02:47:51,950
I told you, I told you.

5285
02:47:52,230 --> 02:47:52,630
Oh.

5286
02:47:52,690 --> 02:47:52,910
Oh.

5287
02:47:54,530 --> 02:47:55,330
Ladies first.

5288
02:47:57,210 --> 02:47:58,350
You have the flashlight.

5289
02:47:58,470 --> 02:47:59,330
Ladies first.

5290
02:47:59,790 --> 02:48:00,690
I'm a gentleman.

5291
02:48:01,050 --> 02:48:02,050
Alright, I'll go here.

5292
02:48:03,290 --> 02:48:03,690
Alright.

5293
02:48:03,690 --> 02:48:04,450
Alright, Madame.

5294
02:48:04,450 --> 02:48:05,090
No, I can't see.

5295
02:48:05,330 --> 02:48:06,490
It's so dark.

5296
02:48:06,850 --> 02:48:07,250
Madame.

5297
02:48:07,370 --> 02:48:07,690
Madame, why don't you just call...

5298
02:48:09,190 --> 02:48:10,150
It's so dark.

5299
02:48:10,390 --> 02:48:11,110
I can't see.

5300
02:48:11,210 --> 02:48:13,550
Don't worry, I'll flash... I'm holding the flashlight in front of you now.

5301
02:48:13,710 --> 02:48:14,350
While you...

5302
02:48:15,790 --> 02:48:16,870
I'm flashing your butt.

5303
02:48:17,210 --> 02:48:17,690
It's on the wall.

5304
02:48:17,890 --> 02:48:18,550
It's on the wall.

5305
02:48:19,550 --> 02:48:20,270
Oh my god.

5306
02:48:20,390 --> 02:48:21,370
What is going on here?

5307
02:48:21,530 --> 02:48:23,190
Oh, I don't like that camera.

5308
02:48:23,630 --> 02:48:24,150
I don't either.

5309
02:48:24,150 --> 02:48:25,190
We can't see what's in front of us.

5310
02:48:25,230 --> 02:48:26,210
We can't see what's in front of us.

5311
02:48:26,310 --> 02:48:27,050
Oh my god.

5312
02:48:27,750 --> 02:48:28,530
Oh, it's gone.

5313
02:48:29,090 --> 02:48:29,730
It's gone.

5314
02:48:29,810 --> 02:48:30,090
It's gone?

5315
02:48:30,490 --> 02:48:31,530
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's gone.

5316
02:48:33,310 --> 02:48:34,350
Oh, it's Julia.

5317
02:48:34,870 --> 02:48:35,610
Oh, it's Julia.

5318
02:48:39,010 --> 02:48:39,870
It's Julia.

5319
02:48:40,930 --> 02:48:41,410
It's Julia.

5320
02:48:41,410 --> 02:48:41,470
It's Julia.

5321
02:48:44,470 --> 02:48:45,310
It's Julia.

5322
02:48:46,130 --> 02:48:46,810
It's Julia.

5323
02:48:46,810 --> 02:48:48,990
Why were you so afraid of your own girlfriend?

5324
02:48:49,550 --> 02:48:51,290
No, I just wanted you to go first.

5325
02:48:51,410 --> 02:48:53,170
Because I'm ladies first, you know?

5326
02:48:53,430 --> 02:48:54,130
Oh, okay.

5327
02:48:56,850 --> 02:48:57,790
Yeah, yeah.

5328
02:48:59,230 --> 02:48:59,710
Yeah, yeah.

5329
02:49:00,230 --> 02:49:01,970
Yeah, I guess I'll do it myself.

5330
02:49:02,510 --> 02:49:03,470
Yeah, do it yourself.

5331
02:49:04,310 --> 02:49:05,510
Dude, what was that?

5332
02:49:05,570 --> 02:49:07,230
Why were you screaming at my girlfriend?

5333
02:49:07,950 --> 02:49:09,450
I mean, it's Julia.

5334
02:49:10,890 --> 02:49:12,910
I thought we wanted to keep Julia alive.

5335
02:49:13,790 --> 02:49:15,530
Yeah, but I still don't like her.

5336
02:49:15,950 --> 02:49:16,510
Oh my god.

5337
02:49:16,590 --> 02:49:17,670
Okay, we're trapped in there.

5338
02:49:17,670 --> 02:49:19,290
Okay, we're trapped in the toxic gas again.

5339
02:49:19,990 --> 02:49:22,010
Yeah, great thinking, Alex.

5340
02:49:22,230 --> 02:49:22,790
Good job.

5341
02:49:22,810 --> 02:49:23,610
Oh, there's a guy in here.

5342
02:49:23,710 --> 02:49:24,170
There's a dead body.

5343
02:49:24,830 --> 02:49:26,470
Oh, this has to be the radio tower, right?

5344
02:49:27,130 --> 02:49:28,990
No, this is the captain's room, right?

5345
02:49:29,030 --> 02:49:30,230
Oh, this is the captain's room.

5346
02:49:30,390 --> 02:49:30,970
There's Brad.

5347
02:49:31,710 --> 02:49:32,250
Hi, Brad.

5348
02:49:33,730 --> 02:49:34,530
Oh, premonition.

5349
02:49:35,110 --> 02:49:35,510
Yeah.

5350
02:49:36,170 --> 02:49:37,570
We need to know the premonition.

5351
02:49:38,430 --> 02:49:39,270
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5352
02:49:40,630 --> 02:49:41,430
Oh my god!

5353
02:49:41,590 --> 02:49:41,710
Oh!

5354
02:49:42,290 --> 02:49:42,870
What is it?

5355
02:49:43,430 --> 02:49:45,070
It was one of the bad guys.

5356
02:49:45,130 --> 02:49:46,030
He just shoots himself.

5357
02:49:46,330 --> 02:49:46,830
Oh, what?

5358
02:49:47,170 --> 02:49:49,170
We have to convince him to shoot himself then.

5359
02:49:49,750 --> 02:49:50,150
Yeah.

5360
02:49:51,090 --> 02:49:52,270
I'm taking in these gases.

5361
02:49:53,190 --> 02:49:54,290
There's a door to our right.

5362
02:49:55,470 --> 02:49:56,730
Yeah, there's a door over here.

5363
02:49:57,090 --> 02:49:58,030
Oh, what the fuck?

5364
02:49:58,030 --> 02:49:58,670
Bradley, are you okay?

5365
02:49:58,830 --> 02:49:59,770
Why are you like...

5366
02:49:59,770 --> 02:50:01,550
I don't think Bradley's okay.

5367
02:50:03,470 --> 02:50:05,250
I'm gonna walk over and they're gonna be T-posing.

5368
02:50:06,450 --> 02:50:07,490
Can you open that door?

5369
02:50:07,690 --> 02:50:08,230
No, okay.

5370
02:50:08,430 --> 02:50:09,890
I guess we'll go this way then.

5371
02:50:10,150 --> 02:50:10,510
Yeah.

5372
02:50:12,310 --> 02:50:12,710
Alright.

5373
02:50:13,410 --> 02:50:14,050
Here we go.

5374
02:50:14,770 --> 02:50:15,670
Oh my god!

5375
02:50:15,850 --> 02:50:16,630
Julia, please!

5376
02:50:17,490 --> 02:50:18,610
Julia, what the fuck?

5377
02:50:18,670 --> 02:50:19,310
Why are you so chill?

5378
02:50:19,790 --> 02:50:21,930
Why are you just like standing there like that?

5379
02:50:22,290 --> 02:50:22,770
I know!

5380
02:50:22,930 --> 02:50:23,790
She's chill like that.

5381
02:50:24,290 --> 02:50:24,750
She's so chill?

5382
02:50:24,970 --> 02:50:25,850
Is that another premonition?

5383
02:50:26,690 --> 02:50:27,850
No, it's their route.

5384
02:50:28,750 --> 02:50:30,890
They went from California...

5385
02:50:30,890 --> 02:50:31,330
to home.

5386
02:50:31,470 --> 02:50:34,170
They went to the United States and then...

5387
02:50:34,730 --> 02:50:35,170
Korea?

5388
02:50:35,590 --> 02:50:36,030
Whoa!

5389
02:50:38,170 --> 02:50:40,310
It's almost like they didn't want anyone to know they were coming.

5390
02:50:40,630 --> 02:50:42,670
This is such a messed up... That is a long route.

5391
02:50:42,830 --> 02:50:43,390
In general.

5392
02:50:43,650 --> 02:50:45,370
Why does it go all the way down there?

5393
02:50:46,410 --> 02:50:47,570
There's two islands there.

5394
02:50:48,550 --> 02:50:49,850
Oh, I got a secret.

5395
02:50:50,530 --> 02:50:51,810
We got a secret.

5396
02:50:52,930 --> 02:50:53,890
I found a note.

5397
02:50:55,070 --> 02:50:56,210
Oh, I see you.

5398
02:50:56,230 --> 02:50:56,770
I'm watching you.

5399
02:50:56,870 --> 02:50:57,350
Pick it up.

5400
02:50:57,350 --> 02:50:58,510
Let's see.

5401
02:50:58,650 --> 02:51:01,450
The United States Department of the Navy.

5402
02:51:01,790 --> 02:51:03,070
The ship was blown off course.

5403
02:51:03,310 --> 02:51:04,490
The flight was bad.

5404
02:51:05,470 --> 02:51:06,950
They couldn't establish a position.

5405
02:51:07,490 --> 02:51:07,850
Oh!

5406
02:51:08,370 --> 02:51:09,510
There was a storm.

5407
02:51:09,950 --> 02:51:11,250
Well, and somebody...

5408
02:51:11,250 --> 02:51:11,930
went overboard.

5409
02:51:12,350 --> 02:51:13,390
Someone failed their...

5410
02:51:13,390 --> 02:51:13,970
QuickTime events.

5411
02:51:14,110 --> 02:51:15,010
That could have been you, Mint.

5412
02:51:15,450 --> 02:51:16,810
That could have been me.

5413
02:51:16,850 --> 02:51:18,290
Oh, there's a dead guy here.

5414
02:51:18,630 --> 02:51:19,710
There's dead guys everywhere.

5415
02:51:19,930 --> 02:51:20,050
The radio!

5416
02:51:20,310 --> 02:51:21,030
Wait, this is the radio!

5417
02:51:21,590 --> 02:51:21,970
Here.

5418
02:51:22,510 --> 02:51:23,390
I found it.

5419
02:51:24,390 --> 02:51:25,890
There's only one way.

5420
02:51:28,750 --> 02:51:29,570
I found it.

5421
02:51:29,610 --> 02:51:29,950
I found it.

5422
02:51:29,950 --> 02:51:31,330
This thing actually still works?

5423
02:51:31,410 --> 02:51:32,070
Yeah, I found it.

5424
02:51:34,230 --> 02:51:36,350
Alright, let's see if you know how to do it.

5425
02:51:36,570 --> 02:51:37,550
You found it!

5426
02:51:37,630 --> 02:51:38,290
You found it!

5427
02:51:39,110 --> 02:51:39,290
Oh!

5428
02:51:40,430 --> 02:51:41,970
Good ol' short-wave radio.

5429
02:51:44,590 --> 02:51:45,730
What am I listening for?

5430
02:51:45,830 --> 02:51:46,390
Come on, fuck it.

5431
02:51:46,410 --> 02:51:47,270
You're the captain!

5432
02:51:48,730 --> 02:51:49,490
Number station?

5433
02:51:51,530 --> 02:51:52,410
Military bandwidth.

5434
02:51:53,370 --> 02:51:54,750
Which one are we trying to find?

5435
02:51:54,970 --> 02:51:55,830
Oh, the military.

5436
02:51:57,350 --> 02:51:57,650
Yeah.

5437
02:51:58,990 --> 02:52:00,050
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.

5438
02:52:00,630 --> 02:52:01,930
Do you read us?

5439
02:52:02,510 --> 02:52:02,950
Over.

5440
02:52:03,190 --> 02:52:04,090
Beep, beep, beep, beep.

5441
02:52:04,210 --> 02:52:04,310
Over.

5442
02:52:05,270 --> 02:52:05,670
Over.

5443
02:52:07,770 --> 02:52:09,770
That guy doesn't... I don't think that's real.

5444
02:52:10,070 --> 02:52:12,050
At least there's someone listening.

5445
02:52:12,290 --> 02:52:13,610
The signal's in and out though.

5446
02:52:13,690 --> 02:52:15,110
That guy is too panicked.

5447
02:52:15,350 --> 02:52:16,790
Yeah, that's what I was thinking too.

5448
02:52:17,350 --> 02:52:20,130
I'm gonna say our coordinates.

5449
02:52:20,410 --> 02:52:22,530
If you can hear me, we're on board an abandoned freighter.

5450
02:52:22,870 --> 02:52:23,390
12 degrees, 30 minutes south.

5451
02:52:23,390 --> 02:52:25,930
Just like when it's 911, say your address first.

5452
02:52:25,930 --> 02:52:28,110
251 degrees, 20 minutes west.

5453
02:52:28,230 --> 02:52:28,710
Over.

5454
02:52:29,010 --> 02:52:29,570
Over.

5455
02:52:30,110 --> 02:52:30,730
Please repeat.

5456
02:52:34,140 --> 02:52:35,700
Why is he panicking?

5457
02:52:35,900 --> 02:52:36,840
Yeah, I...

5458
02:52:38,260 --> 02:52:39,220
Mayday, mayday.

5459
02:52:40,760 --> 02:52:41,740
Thank you, sir.

5460
02:52:43,080 --> 02:52:44,660
We're on a large freighter.

5461
02:52:44,680 --> 02:52:45,200
Say the address.

5462
02:52:45,260 --> 02:52:46,180
Why are you describing it?

5463
02:52:46,820 --> 02:52:47,380
Coordinates.

5464
02:52:47,380 --> 02:52:47,380
Over.

5465
02:52:49,180 --> 02:52:50,040
Coordinates, coordinates.

5466
02:52:50,300 --> 02:52:50,760
Coordinates.

5467
02:52:51,660 --> 02:52:52,640
Come in, over.

5468
02:52:53,300 --> 02:52:55,320
Come in, come in, please, anyone.

5469
02:52:56,180 --> 02:52:57,200
Come in, over.

5470
02:52:58,160 --> 02:52:59,120
You screwed it up.

5471
02:52:59,200 --> 02:52:59,720
Oh no!

5472
02:53:01,860 --> 02:53:03,000
Fliss, you ruined it.

5473
02:53:03,440 --> 02:53:04,520
You're Fliss!

5474
02:53:05,620 --> 02:53:05,940
No!

5475
02:53:07,080 --> 02:53:08,200
Come here, look!

5476
02:53:10,940 --> 02:53:11,740
Oh no.

5477
02:53:12,040 --> 02:53:13,120
Brad wants to go down.

5478
02:53:13,540 --> 02:53:15,000
Look at this.

5479
02:53:15,340 --> 02:53:16,900
Bradley's awfully brave, isn't he?

5480
02:53:17,220 --> 02:53:18,140
Just push him in.

5481
02:53:18,240 --> 02:53:18,820
Push him in.

5482
02:53:18,880 --> 02:53:19,540
It'll be so funny.

5483
02:53:19,920 --> 02:53:20,300
Yeah.

5484
02:53:21,760 --> 02:53:22,580
No shit.

5485
02:53:24,780 --> 02:53:26,040
Anywhere will lead somewhere.

5486
02:53:26,380 --> 02:53:29,180
I think someone should wait here in case a message comes through.

5487
02:53:29,360 --> 02:53:30,820
I'll go, obviously.

5488
02:53:31,360 --> 02:53:32,500
I can do this.

5489
02:53:32,840 --> 02:53:35,760
Brad, you're a hero!

5490
02:53:35,800 --> 02:53:36,160
Let Brad go!

5491
02:53:37,380 --> 02:53:39,620
Sounds like you're scared of someone stepping out of your shadow.

5492
02:53:39,660 --> 02:53:40,520
Brad, you almost...

5493
02:53:40,520 --> 02:53:42,500
You almost killed somebody!

5494
02:53:43,240 --> 02:53:44,820
We should have left him to die.

5495
02:53:45,160 --> 02:53:46,080
We should have left him to die.

5496
02:53:47,900 --> 02:53:48,340
Try...

5497
02:53:49,580 --> 02:53:50,020
I...

5498
02:53:50,020 --> 02:53:50,900
Okay.

5499
02:53:51,600 --> 02:53:52,900
If you're sure you're up for it...

5500
02:53:52,900 --> 02:53:54,480
If he dies, he dies.

5501
02:53:54,860 --> 02:53:55,860
If he dies, he dies.

5502
02:53:56,200 --> 02:53:56,900
Julia, what?

5503
02:53:58,160 --> 02:53:59,000
You know my bodyguard.

5504
02:53:59,120 --> 02:54:00,100
I can take care of myself.

5505
02:54:00,420 --> 02:54:00,940
What?

5506
02:54:01,060 --> 02:54:01,900
Why are you going?

5507
02:54:02,820 --> 02:54:03,340
Um...

5508
02:54:03,340 --> 02:54:04,540
Fliss and Brad again?

5509
02:54:06,440 --> 02:54:08,260
Julia says she can handle it.

5510
02:54:08,280 --> 02:54:09,880
You're playing it for him!

5511
02:54:10,400 --> 02:54:11,660
You fucking...

5512
02:54:11,660 --> 02:54:13,240
Oh my god!

5513
02:54:13,340 --> 02:54:15,820
You gotta let Julia and Brad!

5514
02:54:18,300 --> 02:54:20,420
One of us is playing Julia and Brad.

5515
02:54:20,560 --> 02:54:21,820
Brad, the other...

5516
02:54:21,820 --> 02:54:23,520
Oh my god.

5517
02:54:23,680 --> 02:54:27,340
Don't say that you're gonna do it if you're not gonna do it.

5518
02:54:30,720 --> 02:54:32,340
Don't say it!

5519
02:54:32,520 --> 02:54:32,620
Don't say it!

5520
02:54:32,620 --> 02:54:34,260
I hope you get Julia and Brad.

5521
02:54:34,580 --> 02:54:35,560
Oh my god.

5522
02:54:35,860 --> 02:54:36,740
So loud.

5523
02:54:36,960 --> 02:54:38,480
I hope you get Julia and Brad.

5524
02:54:39,820 --> 02:54:41,100
Oh, I'm Julia!

5525
02:54:41,240 --> 02:54:42,600
Julia, I'm Brad!

5526
02:54:43,440 --> 02:54:46,160
Julia definitely has tetanus.

5527
02:54:46,160 --> 02:54:47,740
She's all scraped up.

5528
02:54:47,940 --> 02:54:48,780
Oh no.

5529
02:54:49,220 --> 02:54:50,120
Everything still work?

5530
02:54:51,600 --> 02:54:52,540
Everyone okay?

5531
02:54:54,680 --> 02:54:55,320
Decide.

5532
02:54:56,100 --> 02:54:56,360
Are we okay?

5533
02:54:57,000 --> 02:54:57,780
We're okay.

5534
02:54:57,980 --> 02:54:59,760
Oh god, you're the crazier one.

5535
02:54:59,960 --> 02:55:02,120
You're gonna try and kill me at some point.

5536
02:55:03,600 --> 02:55:05,560
Now you'll know how I fell.

5537
02:55:06,280 --> 02:55:07,320
We have to find the generator.

5538
02:55:08,460 --> 02:55:10,180
We can power up the radio.

5539
02:55:10,980 --> 02:55:11,500
Okay.

5540
02:55:11,760 --> 02:55:13,080
We'll wait here by the radio.

5541
02:55:13,140 --> 02:55:15,300
Finally somebody's gonna die now.

5542
02:55:16,200 --> 02:55:17,460
Someone will die.

5543
02:55:17,800 --> 02:55:19,200
Thanks for the tiny lighter.

5544
02:55:21,440 --> 02:55:22,920
To set you on fire.

5545
02:55:24,080 --> 02:55:24,720
Let's go.

5546
02:55:26,180 --> 02:55:27,360
I'm gonna put a lighter up.

5547
02:55:27,560 --> 02:55:29,660
With toxic gas around it.

5548
02:55:29,820 --> 02:55:30,420
I know, right?

5549
02:55:30,720 --> 02:55:32,800
It just doesn't feel like a very good idea.

5550
02:55:33,080 --> 02:55:35,200
Are you okay?

5551
02:55:35,420 --> 02:55:35,840
There you go.

5552
02:55:37,240 --> 02:55:40,540
We look like real Scooby Doo guys.

5553
02:55:40,940 --> 02:55:40,960
Yeah.

5554
02:55:41,880 --> 02:55:42,860
Is that the sickbay?

5555
02:55:43,100 --> 02:55:44,240
Is that what that said over there?

5556
02:55:45,280 --> 02:55:47,000
We need to find the generator.

5557
02:55:48,000 --> 02:55:49,440
Don't split up guys.

5558
02:55:50,940 --> 02:55:53,080
It's probably really nasty in here.

5559
02:55:53,960 --> 02:55:55,440
Really gassy in here.

5560
02:55:55,440 --> 02:55:59,180
That's where all the dirtiest of germs are.

5561
02:55:59,460 --> 02:56:00,980
There's a door here.

5562
02:56:01,320 --> 02:56:03,580
Inhale the gases guys.

5563
02:56:05,400 --> 02:56:06,380
Sniffle, sniffle.

5564
02:56:07,860 --> 02:56:09,780
Yeah, I love going crazy.

5565
02:56:11,740 --> 02:56:13,100
More hallucinations.

5566
02:56:14,480 --> 02:56:15,160
Uh...

5567
02:56:15,160 --> 02:56:16,200
Wait, wait, wait.

5568
02:56:16,540 --> 02:56:25,420
Medical officers report minutes of meeting between scientist X, CWO Walter Bishop and CWO Tom Palmer with Sergeant Peter.

5569
02:56:25,420 --> 02:56:27,180
Peter Wood observing and...

5570
02:56:27,180 --> 02:56:27,940
Blalala...

5571
02:56:27,940 --> 02:56:31,060
X for meeting with our team and says we can mutually learn.

5572
02:56:31,180 --> 02:56:31,200
Oh!

5573
02:56:31,680 --> 02:56:34,500
Oh, my thing talks about Charles and Joe.

5574
02:56:34,660 --> 02:56:37,240
It talks about like Charles beating up Joe.

5575
02:56:37,920 --> 02:56:38,480
Oh!

5576
02:56:38,620 --> 02:56:41,040
My thing talks about Manchurian...

5577
02:56:41,040 --> 02:56:41,800
Wait, wait, wait.

5578
02:56:41,940 --> 02:56:43,460
Oh, this is actually really important.

5579
02:56:43,620 --> 02:56:47,100
The United States has been aware of certain agencies investigating the...

5580
02:56:47,100 --> 02:56:49,800
chemical and biological agents in warfare.

5581
02:56:50,060 --> 02:56:50,880
Our act...

5582
02:56:51,260 --> 02:56:52,880
limited by the Geneva Protocol...

5583
02:56:53,220 --> 02:56:54,020
have experiments.

5584
02:56:54,180 --> 02:56:55,400
We are unable to...

5585
02:56:56,480 --> 02:56:57,120
describe...

5586
02:56:57,120 --> 02:56:59,420
describes an investigation during...

5587
02:56:59,420 --> 02:57:01,540
to test the effects of human subjects...

5588
02:57:01,540 --> 02:57:03,520
on the molecule crystal structure hallucinogens...

5589
02:57:04,220 --> 02:57:04,500
Oh!

5590
02:57:05,560 --> 02:57:06,580
Manchurian gold!

5591
02:57:07,300 --> 02:57:09,040
Oh, my God, that is!

5592
02:57:09,700 --> 02:57:10,940
Unitions battle.

5593
02:57:11,220 --> 02:57:13,440
It was... even relatively minor.

5594
02:57:13,780 --> 02:57:15,520
observed to trigger significant...

5595
02:57:15,520 --> 02:57:16,480
hallucinations.

5596
02:57:17,140 --> 02:57:18,720
Men... highly convincing.

5597
02:57:18,920 --> 02:57:19,560
Men.

5598
02:57:19,780 --> 02:57:22,680
Things that were not really there.

5599
02:57:22,800 --> 02:57:24,480
Even the danger was manifold.

5600
02:57:25,420 --> 02:57:26,340
And its intensity.

5601
02:57:26,540 --> 02:57:29,520
Okay, so it is toxic gas that we're inhaling...

5602
02:57:29,520 --> 02:57:29,960
right now.

5603
02:57:33,860 --> 02:57:35,440
What else was over here?

5604
02:57:35,620 --> 02:57:36,140
It was nothing.

5605
02:57:36,460 --> 02:57:37,100
It was just...

5606
02:57:37,100 --> 02:57:38,360
Lock me in jail, bad boy.

5607
02:57:41,000 --> 02:57:42,260
You have a boyfriend.

5608
02:57:42,600 --> 02:57:43,480
What the fuck.

5609
02:57:44,560 --> 02:57:46,240
I'm unhappy in my relationship.

5610
02:57:47,140 --> 02:57:48,040
I can tell.

5611
02:57:48,120 --> 02:57:48,840
I can tell you've been...

5612
02:57:48,840 --> 02:57:50,340
actively sabotaging it.

5613
02:57:52,460 --> 02:57:53,500
Oh, this is the report.

5614
02:57:53,620 --> 02:57:54,740
Oh, this is where I was at!

5615
02:57:55,000 --> 02:57:55,360
Yeah, you're right!

5616
02:57:55,360 --> 02:57:59,020
This is the Charles and Jo beating up thing.

5617
02:57:59,780 --> 02:58:01,560
Yeah, this is the thing I read.

5618
02:58:01,960 --> 02:58:03,560
And then there should be blood on the wall here.

5619
02:58:03,560 --> 02:58:06,160
I can't believe you tried to NTR with his brother!

5620
02:58:06,320 --> 02:58:07,280
That's fucked up.

5621
02:58:07,820 --> 02:58:09,740
Yeah, there's the blood that I saw earlier.

5622
02:58:10,260 --> 02:58:11,120
Oh my gosh.

5623
02:58:11,780 --> 02:58:12,880
Don't worry about it.

5624
02:58:13,740 --> 02:58:19,480
Guys, the longer we stay here, the more toxic gas we're gonna get.

5625
02:58:20,160 --> 02:58:20,640
Oooh!

5626
02:58:23,520 --> 02:58:24,000
Yummy!

5627
02:58:24,940 --> 02:58:26,940
I can't wait to see the kids.

5628
02:58:28,000 --> 02:58:29,040
How did you...

5629
02:58:29,840 --> 02:58:30,480
That's me.

5630
02:58:31,400 --> 02:58:31,880
Woah!

5631
02:58:32,220 --> 02:58:33,220
Did you hear that?

5632
02:58:33,740 --> 02:58:34,940
Oh, that's a body!

5633
02:58:35,020 --> 02:58:36,000
That's a dead body I found!

5634
02:58:36,400 --> 02:58:36,960
That's him!

5635
02:58:38,500 --> 02:58:38,980
What?

5636
02:58:39,140 --> 02:58:39,260
What?

5637
02:58:42,460 --> 02:58:43,160
What's this?

5638
02:58:43,880 --> 02:58:46,100
No, there's a dead body literally right next to me.

5639
02:58:49,480 --> 02:58:50,000
Let's see.

5640
02:58:50,080 --> 02:58:50,720
I don't see a body.

5641
02:58:51,260 --> 02:58:51,740
What?

5642
02:58:51,880 --> 02:58:53,160
There's literally no body here.

5643
02:58:53,480 --> 02:58:54,340
Wait, what?

5644
02:58:54,540 --> 02:58:55,560
Oh, on the ground!

5645
02:58:55,820 --> 02:58:57,900
Yeah, I was like, what do you mean?

5646
02:59:01,660 --> 02:59:02,740
I'm looking at him.

5647
02:59:02,980 --> 02:59:03,520
What is this?

5648
02:59:03,560 --> 02:59:04,320
Is this important?

5649
02:59:04,900 --> 02:59:10,760
I observed signs of severe distress consistent with evidence of panic observed in the same soldier during his watch duty.

5650
02:59:10,960 --> 02:59:13,380
Oh, it's talking about the hallucination that he's been getting.

5651
02:59:13,760 --> 02:59:14,220
Yeah!

5652
02:59:14,500 --> 02:59:14,980
Oooh!

5653
02:59:15,360 --> 02:59:16,860
Menchurian gold, menchurian gold.

5654
02:59:17,120 --> 02:59:18,480
Yeah, this is the body.

5655
02:59:18,840 --> 02:59:19,460
Yeah, this is the body.

5656
02:59:19,480 --> 02:59:20,400
This dead body.

5657
02:59:21,240 --> 02:59:22,320
Yeah, I didn't see him.

5658
02:59:22,460 --> 02:59:23,740
I thought he went in the bed.

5659
02:59:24,220 --> 02:59:26,200
Because that's where sick bodies normally would be.

5660
02:59:26,240 --> 02:59:27,440
Yeah, he was stuffed in the...

5661
02:59:27,440 --> 02:59:29,200
in this closet locker.

5662
02:59:29,440 --> 02:59:30,020
And I like...

5663
02:59:31,560 --> 02:59:32,680
That's why I was like...

5664
02:59:33,100 --> 02:59:35,240
Yeah, like a hundred years ago.

5665
02:59:35,500 --> 02:59:36,360
Wait, where did you go?

5666
02:59:37,360 --> 02:59:38,080
Oh, there you are.

5667
02:59:39,020 --> 02:59:40,440
I was like, where are we?

5668
02:59:41,300 --> 02:59:42,540
Are we splitting up already?

5669
02:59:43,240 --> 02:59:44,260
Yeah, we're splitting up.

5670
02:59:44,780 --> 02:59:45,860
We gotta get that generator.

5671
02:59:46,140 --> 02:59:46,480
Oh, come on.

5672
02:59:46,800 --> 02:59:47,360
I'm stuck.

5673
02:59:47,500 --> 02:59:48,140
Wait, hold on.

5674
02:59:50,840 --> 02:59:52,120
We can go down.

5675
02:59:52,120 --> 02:59:53,160
We can go down.

5676
02:59:53,320 --> 02:59:55,120
We can only go down.

5677
02:59:55,740 --> 02:59:56,320
Go down.

5678
02:59:57,180 --> 02:59:57,960
Ladies first.

5679
02:59:58,500 --> 03:00:00,580
Nope, I think Bradley's the latest.

5680
03:00:00,820 --> 03:00:02,260
Okay, touche.

5681
03:00:04,060 --> 03:00:05,300
Here, come check this out.

5682
03:00:07,020 --> 03:00:08,720
Yeah, I found the ladder.

5683
03:00:09,620 --> 03:00:11,200
Oh, sure, yeah.

5684
03:00:11,260 --> 03:00:12,240
Wait, what are you looking at?

5685
03:00:12,540 --> 03:00:13,540
Is this the generator?

5686
03:00:13,800 --> 03:00:15,840
Gotta find the kitchen raggy.

5687
03:00:18,020 --> 03:00:19,060
Gotta find the kitchen raggy.

5688
03:00:19,060 --> 03:00:21,180
Well, it sure looks gassy in here.

5689
03:00:21,840 --> 03:00:22,400
Roll.

5690
03:00:24,040 --> 03:00:25,160
Uh oh.

5691
03:00:25,700 --> 03:00:26,100
Uh oh.

5692
03:00:26,920 --> 03:00:27,480
Ow.

5693
03:00:30,560 --> 03:00:31,840
Come down here.

5694
03:00:32,000 --> 03:00:32,980
Come down here, Julia.

5695
03:00:33,740 --> 03:00:34,640
Come down here, Julia.

5696
03:00:34,640 --> 03:00:37,820
She won't be able to get back up if you tell her to come down.

5697
03:00:37,920 --> 03:00:38,480
She won't be able to get back up if you tell her to come down.

5698
03:00:38,480 --> 03:00:38,920
Come down.

5699
03:00:39,420 --> 03:00:40,620
You have shoes.

5700
03:00:40,720 --> 03:00:41,860
I have bare feet.

5701
03:00:44,040 --> 03:00:45,300
I'm just a lady.

5702
03:00:45,920 --> 03:00:46,360
I'm just a lady.

5703
03:00:46,360 --> 03:00:47,420
Oh, God.

5704
03:00:47,640 --> 03:00:47,940
What's up?

5705
03:00:49,020 --> 03:00:50,820
Wait, I didn't see anything.

5706
03:00:50,920 --> 03:00:51,580
I just heard it.

5707
03:00:51,680 --> 03:00:51,880
Me too.

5708
03:00:51,980 --> 03:00:52,840
I just heard it too.

5709
03:00:53,020 --> 03:00:54,400
I was not paying attention.

5710
03:00:54,780 --> 03:00:55,820
I don't think there was something there.

5711
03:00:57,420 --> 03:00:58,100
You're not.

5712
03:00:59,420 --> 03:01:01,540
Okay, so, follow my thinking here.

5713
03:01:01,660 --> 03:01:02,060
Okay.

5714
03:01:02,140 --> 03:01:03,740
We know this ship was carrying the Venturi and gold.

5715
03:01:04,040 --> 03:01:04,440
Yeah.

5716
03:01:04,520 --> 03:01:08,760
But that was really some sort of hallucinogenic bioweapon developed in China during World War II.

5717
03:01:09,020 --> 03:01:09,420
Right.

5718
03:01:09,500 --> 03:01:11,620
And we know that it was super unstable.

5719
03:01:12,560 --> 03:01:12,960
Yeah.

5720
03:01:13,540 --> 03:01:15,160
So maybe it's still here?

5721
03:01:15,760 --> 03:01:16,340
Maybe it has a secret.

5722
03:01:16,360 --> 03:01:18,300
Wait, but why am I...

5723
03:01:18,300 --> 03:01:19,240
Oh!

5724
03:01:20,400 --> 03:01:21,620
Oh my God, Brad!

5725
03:01:21,720 --> 03:01:22,640
You're so smart!

5726
03:01:23,080 --> 03:01:25,380
It's not like we figured that out a long time ago.

5727
03:01:25,480 --> 03:01:25,960
He's the...

5728
03:01:25,960 --> 03:01:27,140
He's the brainy nerd.

5729
03:01:33,760 --> 03:01:37,260
We might die because the military wants to keep it a secret.

5730
03:01:37,700 --> 03:01:38,020
We might die because the military wants to keep it a secret.

5731
03:01:38,020 --> 03:01:38,020
Yeah.

5732
03:01:38,320 --> 03:01:38,600
Oooh!

5733
03:01:41,120 --> 03:01:44,160
Maybe in the end only Conrad survives.

5734
03:01:44,900 --> 03:01:46,200
No, I'm kidding.

5735
03:01:46,360 --> 03:01:48,660
Nobody here lives.

5736
03:01:50,260 --> 03:01:51,740
Because that's usually how it goes.

5737
03:01:51,840 --> 03:01:53,160
The military wants to keep it a secret.

5738
03:01:53,380 --> 03:01:54,460
So then we're going to be like...

5739
03:01:54,940 --> 03:01:56,660
Well, we know those coordinates.

5740
03:01:57,100 --> 03:01:58,820
Yeah, they'll be like...

5741
03:01:58,820 --> 03:02:00,160
We'll be like, we're saved!

5742
03:02:00,220 --> 03:02:01,440
And then the military shoots us.

5743
03:02:01,820 --> 03:02:03,060
That's how it always goes.

5744
03:02:03,500 --> 03:02:03,780
Yep.

5745
03:02:05,080 --> 03:02:05,920
Oh, Netherlands.

5746
03:02:07,180 --> 03:02:07,660
Netherlands?

5747
03:02:09,480 --> 03:02:10,440
Oh, Rotterdam.

5748
03:02:10,440 --> 03:02:11,340
Yeah.

5749
03:02:11,980 --> 03:02:12,960
Oh my God.

5750
03:02:12,960 --> 03:02:14,660
This is not an American ship.

5751
03:02:15,240 --> 03:02:15,800
No.

5752
03:02:15,800 --> 03:02:16,720
Oh my God.

5753
03:02:17,080 --> 03:02:18,040
It's not American at all.

5754
03:02:18,100 --> 03:02:19,020
It's not made in America.

5755
03:02:19,900 --> 03:02:21,280
They lied to us.

5756
03:02:21,300 --> 03:02:22,220
How dare they?

5757
03:02:22,480 --> 03:02:23,560
You go the other way.

5758
03:02:23,580 --> 03:02:26,200
No, we're not splitting up.

5759
03:02:26,540 --> 03:02:27,200
Yeah, why not?

5760
03:02:27,780 --> 03:02:30,840
I can't believe we outsourced this ship to Europeans.

5761
03:02:32,440 --> 03:02:33,680
That's why it's cursed.

5762
03:02:33,940 --> 03:02:34,500
That's...

5763
03:02:38,740 --> 03:02:40,060
I don't think there's anything over here except gas.

5764
03:02:40,060 --> 03:02:40,100
I don't think there's anything over here except gas.

5765
03:02:40,100 --> 03:02:40,400
I don't think there's anything over here except gas.

5766
03:02:40,400 --> 03:02:41,920
What are you trying to say about...

5767
03:02:41,920 --> 03:02:42,100
Hop it up!

5768
03:02:42,100 --> 03:02:42,380
Hop it up!

5769
03:02:42,740 --> 03:02:43,840
Hop up the gas!

5770
03:02:44,160 --> 03:02:45,220
Hop up the gas!

5771
03:02:47,240 --> 03:02:48,040
My delusions!

5772
03:02:48,280 --> 03:02:49,660
Oh my God, anime girls!

5773
03:02:49,680 --> 03:02:50,980
Anime girls are real!

5774
03:02:51,180 --> 03:02:52,460
We're gonna see the children!

5775
03:02:52,620 --> 03:02:53,020
It's this way.

5776
03:02:53,040 --> 03:02:53,600
There's stuff here.

5777
03:02:55,200 --> 03:02:56,560
I'm seeing anime girls.

5778
03:02:56,820 --> 03:02:57,400
Oh my God.

5779
03:02:58,100 --> 03:02:59,520
Hop up the gas!

5780
03:02:59,900 --> 03:03:00,560
Hop up the gas!

5781
03:03:03,660 --> 03:03:04,400
Oh, what's this?

5782
03:03:04,500 --> 03:03:06,200
Wait, did we come this way?

5783
03:03:06,340 --> 03:03:07,760
No, we didn't.

5784
03:03:07,820 --> 03:03:09,400
We came from upstairs.

5785
03:03:10,740 --> 03:03:11,780
Oh, you're right.

5786
03:03:16,080 --> 03:03:16,780
How?

5787
03:03:18,760 --> 03:03:20,340
How do we go back upstairs?

5788
03:03:20,740 --> 03:03:21,400
Boom!

5789
03:03:23,900 --> 03:03:24,600
Sure.

5790
03:03:27,100 --> 03:03:27,300
Oh!

5791
03:03:27,440 --> 03:03:28,120
Yay!

5792
03:03:30,780 --> 03:03:31,480
Baby!

5793
03:03:34,500 --> 03:03:34,720
Over!

5794
03:03:38,440 --> 03:03:38,880
Over!

5795
03:03:38,880 --> 03:03:40,340
We need help now!

5796
03:03:40,800 --> 03:03:43,120
There are things on the ship that are trying to hurt us!

5797
03:03:43,360 --> 03:03:43,800
Over!

5798
03:03:44,720 --> 03:03:46,860
Recovery mission is on route to your location.

5799
03:03:47,120 --> 03:03:47,400
Over.

5800
03:03:47,720 --> 03:03:48,160
Oh!

5801
03:03:48,760 --> 03:03:49,200
Oh!

5802
03:03:49,340 --> 03:03:49,780
Again?

5803
03:03:50,260 --> 03:03:51,440
Come on, work diamond!

5804
03:03:52,880 --> 03:03:53,320
Okay.

5805
03:03:53,600 --> 03:03:56,460
Okay, well, now... We have people coming to shoot us!

5806
03:03:56,580 --> 03:03:57,940
Yeah, we have people coming to shoot us!

5807
03:03:59,300 --> 03:04:00,040
Oh my God!

5808
03:04:00,080 --> 03:04:00,780
We did it!

5809
03:04:01,360 --> 03:04:02,280
We did it!

5810
03:04:02,340 --> 03:04:02,960
We did it!

5811
03:04:03,380 --> 03:04:05,820
There's a way over here, but there was also another...

5812
03:04:07,100 --> 03:04:08,780
area... all the way on the other side.

5813
03:04:09,000 --> 03:04:09,480
I don't know.

5814
03:04:09,520 --> 03:04:10,080
I don't think so.

5815
03:04:10,240 --> 03:04:10,320
Oh, gas!

5816
03:04:10,920 --> 03:04:11,740
Sweet, sweet gas!

5817
03:04:11,820 --> 03:04:12,260
Sweet, sweet gas!

5818
03:04:12,920 --> 03:04:14,680
My waifu will... she will be mine!

5819
03:04:15,660 --> 03:04:16,200
My God!

5820
03:04:16,240 --> 03:04:17,900
This is how your waifu's become 3D!

5821
03:04:22,760 --> 03:04:23,480
No 3DPD!

5822
03:04:23,560 --> 03:04:24,760
We won't... Oh, there's a dead guy here!

5823
03:04:25,080 --> 03:04:25,800
Wait, where are you?

5824
03:04:26,420 --> 03:04:27,520
I'm looking at a dead guy.

5825
03:04:28,000 --> 03:04:28,620
Where did you go?

5826
03:04:30,100 --> 03:04:31,880
He is not looking so hot.

5827
03:04:31,880 --> 03:04:33,500
Where the fuck did you go?

5828
03:04:33,580 --> 03:04:34,420
Did you go this way?

5829
03:04:35,420 --> 03:04:37,000
Oh, we definitely split up.

5830
03:04:38,040 --> 03:04:38,660
Oh, we...

5831
03:04:40,180 --> 03:04:40,860
Wait, what?

5832
03:04:41,580 --> 03:04:42,660
I brought you back!

5833
03:04:47,720 --> 03:04:50,880
Wait, they were here?

5834
03:04:55,700 --> 03:04:56,940
I feel like we should.

5835
03:04:57,140 --> 03:04:57,640
Might as well.

5836
03:04:57,880 --> 03:04:58,060
Yeah, take it.

5837
03:04:58,280 --> 03:04:59,020
Yeah, why not?

5838
03:05:01,880 --> 03:05:02,220
Yeah.

5839
03:05:05,620 --> 03:05:06,580
The crows!

5840
03:05:07,140 --> 03:05:07,780
Uh oh.

5841
03:05:08,760 --> 03:05:09,480
Oh no.

5842
03:05:09,700 --> 03:05:11,620
Just when we need to run.

5843
03:05:11,620 --> 03:05:12,180
Oh no.

5844
03:05:12,260 --> 03:05:13,620
Wait, we can hit him over the head with it!

5845
03:05:13,740 --> 03:05:14,360
You're right!

5846
03:05:16,360 --> 03:05:18,200
Is this where he's gonna shoot himself?

5847
03:05:18,380 --> 03:05:19,680
Wait, what the fuck?

5848
03:05:20,020 --> 03:05:20,480
Oh.

5849
03:05:22,240 --> 03:05:23,380
Oh, he's dead!

5850
03:05:23,660 --> 03:05:24,980
He's totally lost it.

5851
03:05:25,000 --> 03:05:25,900
He's totally lost it.

5852
03:05:25,900 --> 03:05:26,480
Yeah, he's crazy.

5853
03:05:27,160 --> 03:05:27,800
Uh oh.

5854
03:05:27,840 --> 03:05:30,400
Uh oh.

5855
03:05:31,880 --> 03:05:32,540
Oh, you see it?

5856
03:05:33,800 --> 03:05:34,200
Ahhh.

5857
03:05:36,800 --> 03:05:38,660
Wow, imagine the smell in there.

5858
03:05:40,860 --> 03:05:41,420
Wow, imagine the smell in there.

5859
03:05:41,420 --> 03:05:42,280
What is he doing?

5860
03:05:42,900 --> 03:05:42,940
What is he doing?

5861
03:05:43,560 --> 03:05:44,560
That's the guy... Oh!

5862
03:05:44,880 --> 03:05:45,480
There's the...

5863
03:05:45,480 --> 03:05:46,240
Oh, there's the thing!

5864
03:05:46,740 --> 03:05:47,380
Yeah, for the bowl!

5865
03:05:49,260 --> 03:05:50,560
What is he trying to do?

5866
03:05:50,720 --> 03:05:51,420
Is he gonna cut him?

5867
03:05:53,280 --> 03:05:54,080
He's opening...

5868
03:05:54,080 --> 03:05:55,620
He's gonna open him up to see his secrets.

5869
03:05:57,220 --> 03:05:58,600
There's gold inside him.

5870
03:05:58,760 --> 03:05:59,940
There's gold inside him.

5871
03:06:00,420 --> 03:06:00,780
There's gold inside him.

5872
03:06:00,780 --> 03:06:01,060
Open him up.

5873
03:06:01,880 --> 03:06:02,300
Open me up!

5874
03:06:02,360 --> 03:06:03,200
There's gold inside!

5875
03:06:05,440 --> 03:06:06,640
Oh, he's hallucinating.

5876
03:06:06,960 --> 03:06:08,180
He's hallucinating again.

5877
03:06:09,180 --> 03:06:10,740
You could totally like scare him.

5878
03:06:10,760 --> 03:06:11,260
Just be like...

5879
03:06:11,730 --> 03:06:13,180
Just be like...

5880
03:06:13,180 --> 03:06:14,300
I see you.

5881
03:06:14,840 --> 03:06:15,480
Okay, okay.

5882
03:06:15,480 --> 03:06:15,980
Don't you dare.

5883
03:06:16,060 --> 03:06:17,080
Don't you dare fuck this up.

5884
03:06:17,200 --> 03:06:18,020
Don't you dare.

5885
03:06:19,300 --> 03:06:19,760
Okay.

5886
03:06:21,160 --> 03:06:21,620
Okay.

5887
03:06:23,640 --> 03:06:25,200
We die, you messed us up.

5888
03:06:25,340 --> 03:06:27,000
There's a lot of pressure here, though.

5889
03:06:27,040 --> 03:06:28,120
There's a lot of...

5890
03:06:28,120 --> 03:06:29,700
The stress makes it...

5891
03:06:29,700 --> 03:06:29,800
There's a lot of pressure.

5892
03:06:31,360 --> 03:06:32,440
There you go.

5893
03:06:32,500 --> 03:06:32,680
See?

5894
03:06:32,680 --> 03:06:33,340
I told you.

5895
03:06:34,040 --> 03:06:35,160
There's a lot of pressure.

5896
03:06:35,920 --> 03:06:36,800
You failed?

5897
03:06:37,480 --> 03:06:38,440
No, I didn't.

5898
03:06:39,040 --> 03:06:40,300
I didn't fail?

5899
03:06:40,600 --> 03:06:41,040
You failed.

5900
03:06:44,720 --> 03:06:46,320
It sounds like you failed.

5901
03:06:46,940 --> 03:06:47,480
It sounds like you failed.

5902
03:06:47,480 --> 03:06:48,120
Avoid Olsen.

5903
03:06:48,240 --> 03:06:48,560
Uh-oh.

5904
03:06:48,640 --> 03:06:49,240
What are we supposed to do?

5905
03:06:49,240 --> 03:06:51,080
I don't know.

5906
03:06:51,260 --> 03:06:52,860
I have time to read notes, right?

5907
03:06:53,500 --> 03:06:55,840
Wait, what?

5908
03:06:56,860 --> 03:06:57,880
Oh my god.

5909
03:06:57,920 --> 03:06:58,860
There's mucho texto.

5910
03:06:59,660 --> 03:07:00,320
Wait, what?

5911
03:07:02,040 --> 03:07:04,360
Human bodies that have undergone this treatment.

5912
03:07:04,520 --> 03:07:06,640
I don't think we have time to read!

5913
03:07:07,320 --> 03:07:07,960
I don't think we have time to read!

5914
03:07:07,960 --> 03:07:08,340
Okay, I'm coming.

5915
03:07:08,500 --> 03:07:08,980
What's going on?

5916
03:07:10,320 --> 03:07:10,760
Oh!

5917
03:07:12,060 --> 03:07:13,040
Oh, what's going on?

5918
03:07:13,160 --> 03:07:14,340
Oh god!

5919
03:07:15,160 --> 03:07:15,600
Hide!

5920
03:07:15,920 --> 03:07:16,300
Hide!

5921
03:07:16,940 --> 03:07:17,800
We've got to split.

5922
03:07:18,280 --> 03:07:19,240
We've got to split!

5923
03:07:21,080 --> 03:07:22,040
He's holding something.

5924
03:07:22,420 --> 03:07:23,760
I'm just gonna check it real quick.

5925
03:07:23,960 --> 03:07:24,100
He's holding something.

5926
03:07:24,100 --> 03:07:24,100
I'm just gonna check it real quick.

5927
03:07:26,640 --> 03:07:27,900
There's nothing in there!

5928
03:07:28,140 --> 03:07:28,680
I swear to...

5929
03:07:28,680 --> 03:07:31,540
I swear to god.

5930
03:07:32,380 --> 03:07:34,940
I swear to god.

5931
03:07:35,220 --> 03:07:39,020
I swear to god.

5932
03:07:39,400 --> 03:07:40,040
I swear to god.

5933
03:07:40,040 --> 03:07:41,060
I swear to god.

5934
03:07:41,820 --> 03:07:41,880
I swear to god.

5935
03:07:41,880 --> 03:07:43,220
I was just curious.

5936
03:07:44,520 --> 03:07:46,540
Now we're gonna die.

5937
03:07:46,960 --> 03:07:48,780
Now we're gonna die.

5938
03:07:50,760 --> 03:07:53,580
This guy can only...

5939
03:07:53,580 --> 03:07:55,820
He can only...

5940
03:07:55,840 --> 03:07:57,220
He can only hallucinate and...

5941
03:07:57,220 --> 03:07:59,000
There must be plenty of that to go around.

5942
03:08:00,180 --> 03:08:02,600
He'll hallucinate us killing us.

5943
03:08:02,620 --> 03:08:02,960
It's fine.

5944
03:08:04,140 --> 03:08:05,820
Where are we gonna go anyway?

5945
03:08:07,420 --> 03:08:08,060
Oh!

5946
03:08:08,800 --> 03:08:10,240
Oh my god.

5947
03:08:10,400 --> 03:08:10,760
Oh god.

5948
03:08:10,780 --> 03:08:11,100
Oh god.

5949
03:08:11,100 --> 03:08:15,100
And I'm to be left here.

5950
03:08:15,600 --> 03:08:16,280
To die.

5951
03:08:17,120 --> 03:08:18,580
But I am...

5952
03:08:18,580 --> 03:08:19,600
Mitt!

5953
03:08:19,800 --> 03:08:20,120
Mitt!

5954
03:08:20,200 --> 03:08:21,600
I swear to god!

5955
03:08:22,660 --> 03:08:25,580
I swear to god!

5956
03:08:25,580 --> 03:08:27,380
I knew I shouldn't have given you the pressure!

5957
03:08:27,560 --> 03:08:30,160
If I kept giving you pressure, it would've been okay!

5958
03:08:31,360 --> 03:08:33,540
It was the only key to success!

5959
03:08:33,860 --> 03:08:34,100
Let's just kill him!

5960
03:08:34,520 --> 03:08:35,740
Let's just kill him!

5961
03:08:36,720 --> 03:08:38,480
It was all the pressure!

5962
03:08:39,500 --> 03:08:41,880
The whole thing I stopped giving you pressure!

5963
03:08:42,600 --> 03:08:43,560
The whole thing I stopped giving you pressure!

5964
03:08:43,820 --> 03:08:44,340
See?

5965
03:08:44,540 --> 03:08:45,120
It's fine.

5966
03:08:45,820 --> 03:08:45,840
See?

5967
03:08:45,840 --> 03:08:45,840
It's fine.

5968
03:08:47,800 --> 03:08:48,320
Oh.

5969
03:08:48,320 --> 03:08:49,400
Keep going!

5970
03:08:49,660 --> 03:08:50,080
Just keep...

5971
03:08:51,180 --> 03:08:54,520
Bradley, please.

5972
03:08:54,820 --> 03:08:55,560
Bradley, please.

5973
03:08:55,580 --> 03:08:56,180
The doors are rusted.

5974
03:08:56,280 --> 03:08:57,240
Come on, we gotta keep going.

5975
03:08:58,360 --> 03:08:58,760
AHHHH!

5976
03:08:59,220 --> 03:08:59,620
Okay.

5977
03:09:00,240 --> 03:09:00,640
Okay.

5978
03:09:02,260 --> 03:09:03,720
This is where he tries to shoot...

5979
03:09:03,720 --> 03:09:04,580
We have to convince him to shoot himself.

5980
03:09:04,880 --> 03:09:06,820
Yeah, this is the guy that I saw shoot himself.

5981
03:09:08,160 --> 03:09:08,820
Turn around.

5982
03:09:09,520 --> 03:09:09,920
Oh.

5983
03:09:10,520 --> 03:09:10,680
Oh.

5984
03:09:10,680 --> 03:09:11,080
Oh.

5985
03:09:11,080 --> 03:09:11,200
Slow.

5986
03:09:11,800 --> 03:09:12,760
Very slow.

5987
03:09:12,860 --> 03:09:13,860
Then we'll get a gun.

5988
03:09:13,960 --> 03:09:14,540
It'll be fine.

5989
03:09:15,980 --> 03:09:17,120
Yeah, real slow.

5990
03:09:17,520 --> 03:09:17,920
Okay.

5991
03:09:19,340 --> 03:09:20,520
Why is he here?

5992
03:09:21,100 --> 03:09:22,120
How did he get here?

5993
03:09:22,480 --> 03:09:22,880
Slow.

5994
03:09:25,580 --> 03:09:26,180
Yeah, why is he here?

5995
03:09:26,240 --> 03:09:26,900
How did he get here?

5996
03:09:27,020 --> 03:09:27,420
How did he get here?

5997
03:09:28,680 --> 03:09:29,300
What do you mean?

5998
03:09:30,140 --> 03:09:30,540
Oh.

5999
03:09:33,500 --> 03:09:34,980
Mint, I swear to god.

6000
03:09:35,060 --> 03:09:36,280
I saw you!

6001
03:09:37,040 --> 03:09:37,860
I saw you!

6002
03:09:38,020 --> 03:09:38,640
I saw you!

6003
03:09:41,580 --> 03:09:42,380
I'm not...

6004
03:09:43,400 --> 03:09:44,160
You're not a spirit!

6005
03:09:44,400 --> 03:09:45,380
We just wanna get out of here.

6006
03:09:46,460 --> 03:09:46,860
Please.

6007
03:09:47,900 --> 03:09:49,240
I'm sorry, but...

6008
03:09:49,240 --> 03:09:52,800
If you're breathing, then you don't get much of a choice in the matter.

6009
03:09:53,200 --> 03:09:54,420
You don't got a say.

6010
03:09:55,580 --> 03:09:55,820
What do you mean?

6011
03:09:56,080 --> 03:09:57,860
Oh, he's seeing him.

6012
03:09:59,860 --> 03:10:01,240
It's all gone changing on me!

6013
03:10:01,800 --> 03:10:02,600
Whoa, the gas.

6014
03:10:02,920 --> 03:10:03,300
What's changing?

6015
03:10:03,640 --> 03:10:04,180
The gas.

6016
03:10:04,280 --> 03:10:04,480
Stay away!

6017
03:10:05,720 --> 03:10:06,920
Stay back from the mist!

6018
03:10:07,340 --> 03:10:08,160
Wait, what's happening?

6019
03:10:08,320 --> 03:10:09,260
Stay back from the mist!

6020
03:10:10,120 --> 03:10:10,760
There's a man!

6021
03:10:11,140 --> 03:10:11,700
There's a man!

6022
03:10:12,000 --> 03:10:12,800
Don't breathe the mist!

6023
03:10:12,900 --> 03:10:13,460
The man, I'm a dead!

6024
03:10:13,620 --> 03:10:14,440
Oh my god, I saw him too!

6025
03:10:15,120 --> 03:10:16,000
Don't breathe the mist.

6026
03:10:16,380 --> 03:10:17,220
The mist, the mist!

6027
03:10:17,540 --> 03:10:19,060
Oh, I'm gonna say nothing.

6028
03:10:20,140 --> 03:10:20,500
Really?

6029
03:10:20,840 --> 03:10:21,560
I'm gonna say nothing.

6030
03:10:21,820 --> 03:10:22,940
You coward, you coward!

6031
03:10:24,440 --> 03:10:25,460
Inside with us.

6032
03:10:25,560 --> 03:10:25,960
Now.

6033
03:10:27,120 --> 03:10:28,400
Please just calm down.

6034
03:10:28,400 --> 03:10:29,320
Why'd you say something?

6035
03:10:30,080 --> 03:10:30,740
I didn't!

6036
03:10:30,740 --> 03:10:31,780
Why did I make the decision?

6037
03:10:32,720 --> 03:10:33,500
It's in one of us.

6038
03:10:33,580 --> 03:10:34,120
Isn't it?

6039
03:10:34,220 --> 03:10:35,360
We have to convince this on him.

6040
03:10:35,380 --> 03:10:35,880
It's in him.

6041
03:10:36,080 --> 03:10:36,820
We have to convince this on him.

6042
03:10:36,820 --> 03:10:36,820
It's in him.

6043
03:10:36,820 --> 03:10:37,320
We have to say it's in him.

6044
03:10:37,640 --> 03:10:41,340
Oh yeah, I'll say I haven't breathed any weird mist.

6045
03:10:41,760 --> 03:10:42,800
Please, I promise.

6046
03:10:43,920 --> 03:10:45,120
My deceitful went up.

6047
03:10:45,180 --> 03:10:45,760
Oh, me too.

6048
03:10:46,400 --> 03:10:47,160
I'm gonna say no.

6049
03:10:47,420 --> 03:10:48,040
It's happening.

6050
03:10:48,720 --> 03:10:49,520
You breathe it.

6051
03:10:49,540 --> 03:10:50,540
Yeah, Bradley, you breathe it.

6052
03:10:50,540 --> 03:10:51,260
No!

6053
03:10:51,660 --> 03:10:52,640
He's gonna shoot Brad!

6054
03:10:52,980 --> 03:10:54,240
Shoot Brad, shoot Brad.

6055
03:10:54,440 --> 03:10:55,000
There is no...

6056
03:10:56,960 --> 03:10:58,300
There was something back...

6057
03:10:58,300 --> 03:10:58,880
Oh, what did I do?

6058
03:10:59,000 --> 03:10:59,860
There is no mist!

6059
03:11:01,340 --> 03:11:02,780
There was something back there!

6060
03:11:03,120 --> 03:11:04,180
Hey, alright, look.

6061
03:11:04,320 --> 03:11:05,860
I think he's gonna shoot Brad.

6062
03:11:05,940 --> 03:11:06,460
I fucked up.

6063
03:11:06,540 --> 03:11:07,780
Uh oh, he's gonna shoot Brad.

6064
03:11:08,020 --> 03:11:09,380
I messed up!

6065
03:11:09,980 --> 03:11:10,620
I knew it.

6066
03:11:11,060 --> 03:11:11,500
I told you.

6067
03:11:11,860 --> 03:11:13,200
Alright, we won it.

6068
03:11:13,460 --> 03:11:14,400
Did you breathe it in?

6069
03:11:15,040 --> 03:11:15,440
No.

6070
03:11:15,540 --> 03:11:15,880
Say no.

6071
03:11:17,700 --> 03:11:18,660
We held our breath.

6072
03:11:19,100 --> 03:11:19,900
No, look.

6073
03:11:20,540 --> 03:11:21,200
We held our breath.

6074
03:11:21,340 --> 03:11:23,300
We did not breathe any of that stuff.

6075
03:11:25,100 --> 03:11:26,140
I fucked up.

6076
03:11:26,140 --> 03:11:26,920
I fucked up!

6077
03:11:26,960 --> 03:11:27,660
Brad's gonna die!

6078
03:11:28,100 --> 03:11:29,100
I fucked up!

6079
03:11:29,480 --> 03:11:30,580
I fucked up!

6080
03:11:31,220 --> 03:11:32,280
I fucked up!

6081
03:11:32,740 --> 03:11:34,820
We've been down here for hours.

6082
03:11:35,780 --> 03:11:37,740
You've been holding your breath this whole time.

6083
03:11:37,960 --> 03:11:38,540
It's true.

6084
03:11:38,920 --> 03:11:40,060
You're holding your breath right now.

6085
03:11:40,640 --> 03:11:41,300
Uh oh.

6086
03:11:42,020 --> 03:11:42,740
Uh oh.

6087
03:11:43,480 --> 03:11:45,440
Oh, we did it!

6088
03:11:45,700 --> 03:11:46,600
We did it!

6089
03:11:46,680 --> 03:11:47,040
We did it!

6090
03:11:50,540 --> 03:11:51,280
How did...

6091
03:11:52,080 --> 03:11:54,000
I can feel it swelling out of me now.

6092
03:11:54,400 --> 03:11:55,820
What if he shoots us first?

6093
03:11:56,460 --> 03:11:57,460
He's judging me!

6094
03:11:57,880 --> 03:11:58,320
Okay.

6095
03:11:59,120 --> 03:11:59,960
Come on, man.

6096
03:12:00,100 --> 03:12:01,060
Come on, shoot yourself.

6097
03:12:01,320 --> 03:12:01,640
The mist!

6098
03:12:01,900 --> 03:12:02,260
The mist!

6099
03:12:03,360 --> 03:12:03,800
Persona!

6100
03:12:04,420 --> 03:12:04,860
Persona!

6101
03:12:04,860 --> 03:12:05,060
What do we do?

6102
03:12:05,200 --> 03:12:06,280
Brad, Pistola, distract!

6103
03:12:07,540 --> 03:12:08,320
What do we do?

6104
03:12:08,860 --> 03:12:09,680
You decide!

6105
03:12:10,520 --> 03:12:10,960
Stop!

6106
03:12:12,220 --> 03:12:13,100
Stop lying!

6107
03:12:15,820 --> 03:12:17,660
You can all see it in me, can't you?

6108
03:12:19,560 --> 03:12:20,780
Persona, did you say...

6109
03:12:20,780 --> 03:12:21,600
Come on, come on.

6110
03:12:21,600 --> 03:12:22,420
I didn't say anything!

6111
03:12:22,560 --> 03:12:23,660
Why are you making him stall?

6112
03:12:24,260 --> 03:12:25,260
Oh, oh, oh.

6113
03:12:25,400 --> 03:12:26,400
You're keeping me alive!

6114
03:12:30,560 --> 03:12:32,600
Dude just can't stop monologuing.

6115
03:12:32,620 --> 03:12:33,260
Oh, there it is!

6116
03:12:33,900 --> 03:12:34,920
Oh, maybe, maybe.

6117
03:12:35,740 --> 03:12:36,220
Persona?

6118
03:12:36,580 --> 03:12:37,560
Hey, man, come on.

6119
03:12:37,640 --> 03:12:38,060
Just quit.

6120
03:12:38,260 --> 03:12:38,740
Oh!

6121
03:12:39,120 --> 03:12:43,520
Oh, fucking shit.

6122
03:12:49,070 --> 03:12:50,030
We did it!

6123
03:12:50,110 --> 03:12:50,590
Let's go!

6124
03:12:50,630 --> 03:12:50,910
We did it!

6125
03:12:50,910 --> 03:12:51,670
We killed another man!

6126
03:12:51,830 --> 03:12:53,350
Yeah, we killed another man!

6127
03:12:55,390 --> 03:12:56,110
There's the option!

6128
03:12:56,550 --> 03:12:56,710
Yeah!

6129
03:12:56,830 --> 03:12:57,230
Yeah!

6130
03:12:59,390 --> 03:13:00,790
Wait, why don't you keep the gun?

6131
03:13:01,610 --> 03:13:02,350
Is it empty?

6132
03:13:03,450 --> 03:13:05,270
Someone was like, you could have saved him.

6133
03:13:05,370 --> 03:13:06,730
Wait, we're supposed to save him?

6134
03:13:07,690 --> 03:13:07,850
Oh.

6135
03:13:07,970 --> 03:13:08,270
Oh.

6136
03:13:11,670 --> 03:13:13,050
No, it was our premonition!

6137
03:13:13,110 --> 03:13:13,930
It was our premonition!

6138
03:13:14,070 --> 03:13:15,730
I thought we were supposed to kill him!

6139
03:13:16,110 --> 03:13:16,770
We were...

6140
03:13:16,770 --> 03:13:17,850
That was our mission!

6141
03:13:21,710 --> 03:13:22,530
Oh, I'm bliss.

6142
03:13:22,730 --> 03:13:23,790
Oh, it's 444!

6143
03:13:23,990 --> 03:13:24,730
Yeah, how sweet.

6144
03:13:24,750 --> 03:13:25,150
Oh, don't...

6145
03:13:25,390 --> 03:13:26,570
Oh my god, it's so spooky!

6146
03:13:27,390 --> 03:13:29,230
Yeah, they took us hostage!

6147
03:13:29,370 --> 03:13:31,490
Why are we supposed to save... He's the bad guy!

6148
03:13:31,870 --> 03:13:32,190
Yeah!

6149
03:13:33,710 --> 03:13:35,290
Doesn't sound like my problem!

6150
03:13:35,810 --> 03:13:37,150
There might be some more gear down there we can use.

6151
03:13:38,190 --> 03:13:39,170
Murderers of my dad!

6152
03:13:44,290 --> 03:13:46,230
We were the murderers all along!

6153
03:13:50,250 --> 03:13:51,130
Oh my god.

6154
03:13:51,170 --> 03:13:52,230
Oh, they're going down.

6155
03:13:52,470 --> 03:13:52,750
Okay.

6156
03:13:55,390 --> 03:13:57,470
Why are we saving the kidnappers?

6157
03:13:59,650 --> 03:14:00,750
Oh my god!

6158
03:14:00,830 --> 03:14:01,950
I swear to god.

6159
03:14:02,330 --> 03:14:03,110
I don't think...

6160
03:14:03,110 --> 03:14:03,930
No, I'm bliss.

6161
03:14:04,050 --> 03:14:04,390
I'm bliss.

6162
03:14:04,590 --> 03:14:04,870
Okay.

6163
03:14:05,870 --> 03:14:06,810
I'm doing this then.

6164
03:14:06,970 --> 03:14:07,370
Okay.

6165
03:14:08,930 --> 03:14:09,770
Are you doing it right now?

6166
03:14:09,890 --> 03:14:10,690
Yes, I am.

6167
03:14:10,890 --> 03:14:11,330
Mess up.

6168
03:14:11,430 --> 03:14:11,550
Hey.

6169
03:14:12,210 --> 03:14:16,450
I had a good track record with this!

6170
03:14:17,190 --> 03:14:18,050
It's on you!

6171
03:14:18,750 --> 03:14:20,270
How did you mess this up?

6172
03:14:22,910 --> 03:14:24,290
It's too much pressure!

6173
03:14:24,930 --> 03:14:25,370
The poor kid!

6174
03:14:25,370 --> 03:14:27,590
The moment I give you pressure, you do better!

6175
03:14:27,830 --> 03:14:30,350
I don't understand how that works with you!

6176
03:14:31,530 --> 03:14:35,270
When I stress you out, you actually pass this!

6177
03:14:36,890 --> 03:14:38,430
Oh my god, there's a man down there!

6178
03:14:38,550 --> 03:14:39,090
The man of a dad!

6179
03:14:39,470 --> 03:14:41,050
The murderers of my dad.

6180
03:14:41,430 --> 03:14:43,110
The murderers of my dad.

6181
03:14:44,890 --> 03:14:45,490
Let's go.

6182
03:14:45,650 --> 03:14:46,290
Let's go.

6183
03:14:46,410 --> 03:14:47,550
Why can't I walk fast?

6184
03:14:47,650 --> 03:14:48,370
I don't know.

6185
03:14:48,370 --> 03:14:49,190
Come on, move, Bliss.

6186
03:14:49,410 --> 03:14:49,670
Move.

6187
03:14:49,990 --> 03:14:50,890
Move you!

6188
03:14:51,390 --> 03:14:52,130
I'm trying!

6189
03:14:52,310 --> 03:14:53,210
She's so slow!

6190
03:14:55,490 --> 03:14:58,290
Every time I pass it, it says, Mint failed it.

6191
03:14:58,370 --> 03:15:00,070
Even though you don't do it.

6192
03:15:00,230 --> 03:15:03,430
Even the game says you failed it.

6193
03:15:03,430 --> 03:15:05,230
It calls me out!

6194
03:15:05,390 --> 03:15:06,310
You disappeared!

6195
03:15:06,730 --> 03:15:07,310
I'm here!

6196
03:15:07,990 --> 03:15:09,070
I'm heading over!

6197
03:15:09,150 --> 03:15:10,070
I'm slowly heading over!

6198
03:15:16,110 --> 03:15:17,410
Oh my god.

6199
03:15:17,750 --> 03:15:22,890
Oh, he's coming over!

6200
03:15:23,110 --> 03:15:24,250
It doesn't matter.

6201
03:15:24,410 --> 03:15:26,050
We need that distributor cat.

6202
03:15:26,190 --> 03:15:26,990
Stop talking!

6203
03:15:28,050 --> 03:15:28,450
Stop!

6204
03:15:28,550 --> 03:15:29,830
He's so loud, Alex!

6205
03:15:30,330 --> 03:15:30,930
I know!

6206
03:15:31,050 --> 03:15:32,450
He's like, hey, it's over here!

6207
03:15:32,490 --> 03:15:33,030
Hey, it's here!

6208
03:15:36,530 --> 03:15:38,170
This is not the way that we win.

6209
03:15:38,350 --> 03:15:40,830
How are they gonna find us?

6210
03:15:41,090 --> 03:15:42,510
Oh, is that your hand?

6211
03:15:42,690 --> 03:15:43,390
I don't know.

6212
03:15:43,990 --> 03:15:44,630
I sure hope so.

6213
03:15:44,810 --> 03:15:45,170
I sure hope so, too.

6214
03:15:45,470 --> 03:15:47,210
I sure hope so, too.

6215
03:15:47,210 --> 03:15:47,370
I sure hope so, too.

6216
03:15:48,930 --> 03:15:49,990
Oh, uh oh.

6217
03:15:50,410 --> 03:15:51,150
Wait, I don't think I can go this way.

6218
03:15:51,150 --> 03:15:52,350
How is there still more?

6219
03:15:53,830 --> 03:15:54,330
Who's that?

6220
03:15:56,730 --> 03:15:57,170
Oh!

6221
03:15:57,670 --> 03:15:58,730
Oh, he sees us!

6222
03:16:02,770 --> 03:16:03,210
What?

6223
03:16:05,390 --> 03:16:05,830
Jump.

6224
03:16:06,030 --> 03:16:07,150
Are we actually gonna do it?

6225
03:16:07,950 --> 03:16:09,810
This is a lot deeper than I expected.

6226
03:16:10,090 --> 03:16:13,390
Yeah, it's pretty uh... uh... Get ready for the quick time!

6227
03:16:15,690 --> 03:16:16,550
What's the first one?

6228
03:16:18,950 --> 03:16:19,810
Min, please.

6229
03:16:20,670 --> 03:16:21,550
Min, please.

6230
03:16:23,970 --> 03:16:24,650
Oh, wait!

6231
03:16:24,650 --> 03:16:26,270
I don't think I had to do it!

6232
03:16:26,490 --> 03:16:27,250
The gases!

6233
03:16:27,350 --> 03:16:28,070
Oh no, the gases!

6234
03:16:28,490 --> 03:16:30,290
The gases are like really...

6235
03:16:30,290 --> 03:16:31,150
He dropped the hammer!

6236
03:16:33,690 --> 03:16:35,710
What is it zooming on?

6237
03:16:35,910 --> 03:16:36,570
The hammer!

6238
03:16:36,670 --> 03:16:36,950
The hammer!

6239
03:16:38,470 --> 03:16:39,150
We'll get it.

6240
03:16:39,230 --> 03:16:39,850
We'll grab that.

6241
03:16:40,030 --> 03:16:43,830
I swear, do not use the hammer against me!

6242
03:16:46,350 --> 03:16:47,430
Oh, is he getting heart attack?

6243
03:16:47,750 --> 03:16:49,210
Oh, he's gonna get scared to death!

6244
03:16:49,250 --> 03:16:50,610
He's getting scared to death now!

6245
03:16:50,830 --> 03:16:52,410
I think we have to do this fast.

6246
03:16:53,230 --> 03:16:54,510
But we're gonna get heart...

6247
03:16:54,650 --> 03:16:55,230
Okay, this is... Yeah.

6248
03:16:55,410 --> 03:16:56,570
This is the moment.

6249
03:16:56,770 --> 03:16:58,730
Are you fucking kidding me?!

6250
03:16:59,450 --> 03:17:01,010
I have to get a fucking...

6251
03:17:01,010 --> 03:17:01,810
Oh my god!

6252
03:17:01,950 --> 03:17:03,670
I have to make sure I don't get a heart attack!

6253
03:17:06,150 --> 03:17:07,290
My chicken down!

6254
03:17:07,590 --> 03:17:08,070
Let's go!

6255
03:17:08,170 --> 03:17:13,090
Are you fucking... Alright, I gotta make sure I don't get a heart attack, I guess.

6256
03:17:13,170 --> 03:17:13,790
Oh, I'm outside.

6257
03:17:14,170 --> 03:17:15,350
Breathing that fresh air.

6258
03:17:15,550 --> 03:17:18,050
I can't believe it!

6259
03:17:18,270 --> 03:17:20,130
This is actual bullshit.

6260
03:17:20,230 --> 03:17:20,330
Oh, yeah.

6261
03:17:20,330 --> 03:17:21,890
I'm fucking going as fast as I can!

6262
03:17:22,470 --> 03:17:23,370
I'm going too!

6263
03:17:23,450 --> 03:17:24,150
I'm pressing LB!

6264
03:17:24,270 --> 03:17:24,630
LB!

6265
03:17:25,150 --> 03:17:25,970
Is this it here?

6266
03:17:26,850 --> 03:17:27,950
Oh, I can't see anything.

6267
03:17:28,190 --> 03:17:29,190
Oh my god.

6268
03:17:29,610 --> 03:17:30,550
I'm going to the door.

6269
03:17:30,610 --> 03:17:30,970
It's fine.

6270
03:17:31,290 --> 03:17:31,890
Wait, who's that?

6271
03:17:31,970 --> 03:17:32,470
What's that down there?

6272
03:17:33,430 --> 03:17:34,950
Oh my god.

6273
03:17:35,090 --> 03:17:35,650
Hold on, I'm coming!

6274
03:17:35,830 --> 03:17:36,150
Hold on.

6275
03:17:36,290 --> 03:17:37,150
I think those are bodies.

6276
03:17:37,310 --> 03:17:38,150
Wait, that's a guy right there.

6277
03:17:38,510 --> 03:17:38,830
Oh!

6278
03:17:40,370 --> 03:17:42,230
Of course, but they will shrink your movement.

6279
03:17:42,730 --> 03:17:45,410
Notaries indicate that M5's platoons have gone missing.

6280
03:17:45,710 --> 03:17:46,010
What?

6281
03:17:46,670 --> 03:17:47,070
I'm coming.

6282
03:17:48,050 --> 03:17:48,550
I'm coming.

6283
03:17:48,570 --> 03:17:48,890
Hold on.

6284
03:17:48,910 --> 03:17:50,690
Is there any... Oh, there's a lot of stuff in here.

6285
03:17:50,830 --> 03:17:50,850
I'm breathing in the gas.

6286
03:17:51,090 --> 03:17:52,110
There's a lot of stuff in here.

6287
03:17:52,170 --> 03:17:52,390
Hold on.

6288
03:17:52,390 --> 03:17:55,210
I'm trying to figure it out where he is.

6289
03:17:56,190 --> 03:17:57,210
He's dead!

6290
03:17:57,330 --> 03:17:57,790
He's dead!

6291
03:17:57,930 --> 03:17:58,490
It's fine!

6292
03:17:59,430 --> 03:18:00,410
Oh no.

6293
03:18:00,930 --> 03:18:02,530
Oh no.

6294
03:18:03,290 --> 03:18:04,570
Oh no.

6295
03:18:04,570 --> 03:18:05,430
The rats!

6296
03:18:06,050 --> 03:18:07,410
Water purification!

6297
03:18:08,650 --> 03:18:11,270
There's rats eating the dead body!

6298
03:18:11,850 --> 03:18:14,230
Why did you get to go outside?

6299
03:18:15,050 --> 03:18:15,930
I'm reading.

6300
03:18:16,070 --> 03:18:17,150
I'm exploring.

6301
03:18:17,430 --> 03:18:18,270
It's kinda nice.

6302
03:18:18,450 --> 03:18:18,950
Oh my god.

6303
03:18:18,950 --> 03:18:20,610
I saw a dead body.

6304
03:18:20,690 --> 03:18:21,770
He was just chilling though.

6305
03:18:22,310 --> 03:18:23,610
Manifest a personal effects.

6306
03:18:24,050 --> 03:18:24,990
Oh no.

6307
03:18:26,650 --> 03:18:27,590
The dog died.

6308
03:18:27,650 --> 03:18:28,510
Oh, these are the guys that died.

6309
03:18:29,530 --> 03:18:29,970
Oh.

6310
03:18:31,190 --> 03:18:31,630
Oops.

6311
03:18:34,990 --> 03:18:35,750
Get off!

6312
03:18:37,170 --> 03:18:38,130
Get off rat!

6313
03:18:38,810 --> 03:18:39,370
I'm fine.

6314
03:18:39,410 --> 03:18:39,710
Hold on.

6315
03:18:39,750 --> 03:18:40,790
There's like three notes in here.

6316
03:18:40,850 --> 03:18:41,390
Get off!

6317
03:18:42,990 --> 03:18:44,270
Oh my god.

6318
03:18:44,890 --> 03:18:45,430
Uh oh.

6319
03:18:45,450 --> 03:18:46,290
I didn't get to read it!

6320
03:18:49,460 --> 03:18:50,000
Uh oh.

6321
03:18:50,740 --> 03:18:51,420
Uh oh.

6322
03:18:52,880 --> 03:18:55,420
Why do I have to deal with all of this?

6323
03:18:55,980 --> 03:18:57,140
There's rats here!

6324
03:18:57,720 --> 03:18:58,960
Wait, I just heard something.

6325
03:18:59,280 --> 03:19:00,140
Oh my god.

6326
03:19:00,160 --> 03:19:00,780
There's so many rats.

6327
03:19:00,920 --> 03:19:01,800
I'm freaking out.

6328
03:19:01,860 --> 03:19:03,360
I'm freaking out over the rats.

6329
03:19:03,700 --> 03:19:05,600
Oh, I see you freaking out over the rats.

6330
03:19:05,740 --> 03:19:06,100
Chill out!

6331
03:19:07,220 --> 03:19:07,980
What the hell?

6332
03:19:08,080 --> 03:19:08,820
What the fuck was that?

6333
03:19:08,980 --> 03:19:10,020
What's going on?

6334
03:19:12,340 --> 03:19:13,120
Do I...

6335
03:19:14,560 --> 03:19:16,460
Um, decide well I guess.

6336
03:19:17,120 --> 03:19:17,600
What?

6337
03:19:18,540 --> 03:19:19,520
Who are you?

6338
03:19:20,840 --> 03:19:21,620
Who are you?

6339
03:19:22,400 --> 03:19:22,960
That's me!

6340
03:19:23,060 --> 03:19:23,300
That's me!

6341
03:19:23,300 --> 03:19:23,600
That's me!

6342
03:19:23,640 --> 03:19:24,260
Don't do anything!

6343
03:19:24,460 --> 03:19:24,700
That's me!

6344
03:19:26,580 --> 03:19:28,080
Yeah, it's me, idiot!

6345
03:19:28,480 --> 03:19:28,840
It's me!

6346
03:19:30,160 --> 03:19:31,340
Is that you?

6347
03:19:32,580 --> 03:19:33,160
That's me!

6348
03:19:34,300 --> 03:19:35,160
Don't do anything!

6349
03:19:35,820 --> 03:19:36,440
It's me!

6350
03:19:37,440 --> 03:19:38,100
Uh oh.

6351
03:19:38,260 --> 03:19:39,460
I think Bliss might die.

6352
03:19:39,940 --> 03:19:41,240
You're the one who's gonna kill.

6353
03:19:43,440 --> 03:19:45,640
The game is bugging out, man.

6354
03:19:45,720 --> 03:19:45,740
What?

6355
03:19:45,800 --> 03:19:46,560
I'm dying?

6356
03:19:47,760 --> 03:19:48,900
Why are you dying?

6357
03:19:50,600 --> 03:19:51,420
What's going on?

6358
03:19:51,520 --> 03:19:52,380
The rats!

6359
03:19:53,300 --> 03:19:54,660
There are no rats!

6360
03:19:55,180 --> 03:19:55,380
The rats!

6361
03:19:55,540 --> 03:19:56,340
Don't kill me!

6362
03:19:56,440 --> 03:19:57,480
Don't kill me!

6363
03:19:58,780 --> 03:19:59,700
Don't you dare!

6364
03:20:00,240 --> 03:20:01,240
Don't you dare, man!

6365
03:20:02,440 --> 03:20:03,240
Don't kill me!

6366
03:20:03,280 --> 03:20:05,100
I'm gonna put you out of your misery, Alex.

6367
03:20:05,320 --> 03:20:06,040
Don't kill me!

6368
03:20:06,080 --> 03:20:07,400
Don't you fucking kill me!

6369
03:20:07,880 --> 03:20:09,280
I'm gonna put you out of your misery!

6370
03:20:10,320 --> 03:20:11,680
Don't do anything to me!

6371
03:20:13,260 --> 03:20:13,780
Stop!

6372
03:20:16,240 --> 03:20:16,760
Stop!

6373
03:20:17,580 --> 03:20:18,100
Stop!

6374
03:20:18,460 --> 03:20:18,740
Stop!

6375
03:20:26,040 --> 03:20:27,720
There were no rats!

6376
03:20:27,720 --> 03:20:28,600
The whole time!

6377
03:20:31,180 --> 03:20:32,340
Oh my god.

6378
03:20:32,360 --> 03:20:34,780
The game is bugging out right now.

6379
03:20:35,980 --> 03:20:38,460
It's always you that's about to kill me!

6380
03:20:38,620 --> 03:20:39,920
I swear to god!

6381
03:20:40,260 --> 03:20:42,180
I know you were the one with the knife!

6382
03:20:42,220 --> 03:20:44,440
I didn't do anything with the knife!

6383
03:20:44,560 --> 03:20:46,400
You were a monster on my screen!

6384
03:20:46,640 --> 03:20:47,900
You were a monster!

6385
03:20:47,900 --> 03:20:50,000
What are you talking about?

6386
03:20:50,920 --> 03:20:52,540
You had two heads!

6387
03:20:55,940 --> 03:20:59,700
Well, you looked like you were getting eaten by rats, but you weren't actually.

6388
03:20:59,820 --> 03:20:59,860
Well, you looked like you were getting eaten by rats, but you weren't actually.

6389
03:20:59,860 --> 03:21:00,840
Oh my god.

6390
03:21:00,980 --> 03:21:02,620
Where the fuck did he come from?

6391
03:21:02,780 --> 03:21:03,480
Why are you there?

6392
03:21:03,700 --> 03:21:04,140
Wait, Brad.

6393
03:21:04,760 --> 03:21:05,420
No way.

6394
03:21:05,500 --> 03:21:06,360
Did we survive?

6395
03:21:06,540 --> 03:21:08,900
Did we save everybody?

6396
03:21:09,960 --> 03:21:10,800
Did we?

6397
03:21:10,920 --> 03:21:12,400
Did we die?

6398
03:21:13,540 --> 03:21:14,640
Oh my god.

6399
03:21:14,640 --> 03:21:15,000
Did we?

6400
03:21:15,160 --> 03:21:16,260
What the fuck?

6401
03:21:16,340 --> 03:21:16,900
No way.

6402
03:21:18,060 --> 03:21:18,660
There's no way.

6403
03:21:19,120 --> 03:21:22,760
There's no way we saved everybody.

6404
03:21:23,700 --> 03:21:25,560
Oh my god.

6405
03:21:25,840 --> 03:21:26,300
Oh my god.

6406
03:21:27,280 --> 03:21:28,240
Let's try it.

6407
03:21:30,120 --> 03:21:31,320
Even Conrad.

6408
03:21:31,800 --> 03:21:32,720
Even Conrad.

6409
03:21:33,100 --> 03:21:35,680
That's actually crazy.

6410
03:21:37,340 --> 03:21:38,540
Holy shit.

6411
03:21:38,980 --> 03:21:41,260
Are we just gonna forget that everything happened?

6412
03:21:41,300 --> 03:21:41,460
Are we just gonna forget that everything happened?

6413
03:21:41,460 --> 03:21:43,980
We're just gonna leave this ship and just forget anything ever happened?

6414
03:21:44,540 --> 03:21:45,800
What about Conrad?

6415
03:21:45,960 --> 03:21:47,880
I thought Conrad was gonna come back.

6416
03:21:47,900 --> 03:21:49,180
I know.

6417
03:21:49,380 --> 03:21:50,220
I thought so too.

6418
03:21:50,300 --> 03:21:51,560
That fucking bastard.

6419
03:21:51,640 --> 03:21:52,500
He just dipped.

6420
03:21:53,340 --> 03:21:54,560
Oh my god.

6421
03:21:55,680 --> 03:21:56,440
No way.

6422
03:21:56,520 --> 03:21:57,260
That actually worked.

6423
03:21:57,420 --> 03:21:57,980
Oh, there he is!

6424
03:21:58,180 --> 03:21:58,960
There he is!

6425
03:21:58,960 --> 03:21:59,700
There's Conrad!

6426
03:22:00,080 --> 03:22:01,080
There he is!

6427
03:22:01,440 --> 03:22:04,660
No way.

6428
03:22:04,740 --> 03:22:05,420
He came back.

6429
03:22:05,440 --> 03:22:06,440
He came back.

6430
03:22:06,460 --> 03:22:07,340
He has a gun.

6431
03:22:07,920 --> 03:22:08,240
Wait.

6432
03:22:08,380 --> 03:22:08,820
No way.

6433
03:22:08,980 --> 03:22:10,260
He's gonna get on the ship.

6434
03:22:10,280 --> 03:22:10,780
Doki, wait.

6435
03:22:10,820 --> 03:22:13,520
No, he doesn't know.

6436
03:22:14,680 --> 03:22:16,920
They're gonna kill Conrad at the end.

6437
03:22:23,400 --> 03:22:24,360
Conrad, no!

6438
03:22:25,000 --> 03:22:25,860
Conrad, no!

6439
03:22:27,260 --> 03:22:27,900
Oh, no.

6440
03:22:28,120 --> 03:22:28,480
Holy shit.

6441
03:22:29,000 --> 03:22:29,640
Oh, my god.

6442
03:22:29,640 --> 03:22:30,860
No, Conrad, don't go on.

6443
03:22:30,900 --> 03:22:32,000
No, don't go back.

6444
03:22:32,120 --> 03:22:33,760
Where's the rest of the Coastal Guard?

6445
03:22:33,900 --> 03:22:34,900
Where is it?

6446
03:22:39,100 --> 03:22:39,940
Oh, shit.

6447
03:22:40,040 --> 03:22:40,440
Oh, shit.

6448
03:22:40,440 --> 03:22:40,700
Oh, shit.

6449
03:22:40,740 --> 03:22:43,840
Oh, it's inviting him in.

6450
03:22:44,280 --> 03:22:44,700
Yeah.

6451
03:22:46,920 --> 03:22:47,300
Oh, there he goes.

6452
03:22:47,380 --> 03:22:47,620
Oh, no.

6453
03:22:47,660 --> 03:22:48,200
There he goes in.

6454
03:22:48,420 --> 03:22:49,240
Oh, my god.

6455
03:22:49,240 --> 03:22:49,560
Conrad!

6456
03:22:50,000 --> 03:22:50,480
No!

6457
03:22:52,440 --> 03:22:53,120
Conrad, no!

6458
03:22:55,960 --> 03:22:56,680
Don't be greedy.

6459
03:22:56,920 --> 03:22:57,760
Do we get a choice?

6460
03:22:58,380 --> 03:22:58,860
No.

6461
03:22:59,400 --> 03:23:00,100
Just let him die.

6462
03:23:00,320 --> 03:23:01,120
No way.

6463
03:23:01,220 --> 03:23:02,280
We saved him.

6464
03:23:02,540 --> 03:23:05,220
Just for him to go back to the ship.

6465
03:23:05,320 --> 03:23:06,900
He has his airpods on!

6466
03:23:10,200 --> 03:23:11,680
Where is the Coastal Guard?

6467
03:23:11,720 --> 03:23:12,280
He's not on the ship.

6468
03:23:12,280 --> 03:23:13,940
How did he get in here?

6469
03:23:15,320 --> 03:23:16,620
Oh, my god.

6470
03:23:17,300 --> 03:23:18,640
I can't believe it.

6471
03:23:19,160 --> 03:23:21,140
This is as cool as Man of Conrad.

6472
03:23:23,880 --> 03:23:26,780
I don't know what happened to my brother.

6473
03:23:27,160 --> 03:23:29,800
He was trying to help us to get help, but...

6474
03:23:29,800 --> 03:23:31,160
He doesn't know anything about what's going on.

6475
03:23:31,160 --> 03:23:32,800
Oh, it's like the Until Dawn ending.

6476
03:23:33,720 --> 03:23:34,160
Yeah.

6477
03:23:34,360 --> 03:23:36,080
Where they do the interviews and stuff.

6478
03:23:36,440 --> 03:23:38,120
God, we should have never split up.

6479
03:23:38,520 --> 03:23:38,720
Oh.

6480
03:23:41,680 --> 03:23:43,920
That's just her being sad about Conrad.

6481
03:23:44,500 --> 03:23:45,100
That's it.

6482
03:23:46,840 --> 03:23:48,360
We don't know if he's dead or not.

6483
03:23:48,360 --> 03:23:50,240
He's just chilling.

6484
03:23:55,000 --> 03:23:56,340
Oh, my god.

6485
03:23:56,480 --> 03:23:56,660
Oh, my god.

6486
03:23:56,660 --> 03:23:56,660
No way.

6487
03:23:56,700 --> 03:23:57,540
That's the ending.

6488
03:23:58,080 --> 03:23:59,640
No fucking way.

6489
03:23:59,780 --> 03:24:01,340
We're like, where's Conrad?

6490
03:24:02,780 --> 03:24:04,360
Technically, we saved everybody.

6491
03:24:05,860 --> 03:24:06,600
No way.

6492
03:24:06,600 --> 03:24:07,340
That's the ending.

6493
03:24:07,560 --> 03:24:07,940
No way.

6494
03:24:07,940 --> 03:24:08,120
That's the ending.

6495
03:24:08,120 --> 03:24:09,200
Oh, my god.

6496
03:24:10,620 --> 03:24:11,520
Oh, my god.

6497
03:24:11,540 --> 03:24:12,140
What is he going to say?

6498
03:24:12,180 --> 03:24:13,300
Is he just going to stare at us?

6499
03:24:13,660 --> 03:24:15,480
Did we make good choices?

6500
03:24:15,480 --> 03:24:16,020
Congratulations.

6501
03:24:16,780 --> 03:24:19,480
Your charges are still breathing.

6502
03:24:19,820 --> 03:24:20,720
That's something.

6503
03:24:21,180 --> 03:24:22,960
That's really impressive for us.

6504
03:24:23,200 --> 03:24:24,800
Yeah, that really is.

6505
03:24:27,140 --> 03:24:30,600
I can't believe we were not trying to save people.

6506
03:24:33,100 --> 03:24:35,760
It's all about decisions, isn't it?

6507
03:24:35,920 --> 03:24:37,600
Decisions made in a hurry.

6508
03:24:37,680 --> 03:24:38,600
In a panic.

6509
03:24:38,660 --> 03:24:40,840
Made with the heart instead of the head.

6510
03:24:41,080 --> 03:24:42,360
Or vice versa.

6511
03:24:43,600 --> 03:24:45,440
Sometimes those decisions take a long time.

6512
03:24:45,480 --> 03:24:46,680
Truly, Conrad.

6513
03:24:48,540 --> 03:24:50,980
But there are repercussions.

6514
03:24:51,920 --> 03:24:52,640
There are?

6515
03:24:54,000 --> 03:24:55,760
Yeah, Conrad's dead now.

6516
03:24:56,000 --> 03:24:56,660
We don't know that.

6517
03:24:56,940 --> 03:24:57,840
We don't know that.

6518
03:24:57,920 --> 03:24:58,740
There's no proof.

6519
03:25:00,520 --> 03:25:01,740
I think so.

6520
03:25:02,080 --> 03:25:02,940
I think he's dead.

6521
03:25:03,220 --> 03:25:04,340
Did we get the good ending?

6522
03:25:05,500 --> 03:25:07,360
The boat literally invited him in.

6523
03:25:08,160 --> 03:25:09,640
Maybe in Little Hope.

6524
03:25:09,820 --> 03:25:11,420
Maybe somewhere else.

6525
03:25:11,880 --> 03:25:12,440
Whoa.

6526
03:25:13,120 --> 03:25:14,140
But be certain.

6527
03:25:15,480 --> 03:25:16,000
I'm sure we'll meet again.

6528
03:25:16,560 --> 03:25:16,960
Whoa.

6529
03:25:18,760 --> 03:25:19,160
It's inevitable.

6530
03:25:22,260 --> 03:25:23,520
Apparently there's a DLC.

6531
03:25:24,160 --> 03:25:24,940
Apparently there's a DLC.

6532
03:25:26,720 --> 03:25:29,260
I don't know if that guy was baiting us.

6533
03:25:29,380 --> 03:25:29,800
What the fuck?

6534
03:25:30,420 --> 03:25:31,300
Are we skipping?

6535
03:25:31,640 --> 03:25:32,420
Yeah, skip to the end.

6536
03:25:39,060 --> 03:25:39,660
There's DLC?

6537
03:25:39,920 --> 03:25:40,420
For real?

6538
03:25:40,580 --> 03:25:41,600
Is there really a DLC?

6539
03:25:41,780 --> 03:25:42,500
Oh, that was a joke.

6540
03:25:42,500 --> 03:25:42,800
Okay.

6541
03:25:43,020 --> 03:25:45,280
Are they vibrating for you?

6542
03:25:46,340 --> 03:25:47,340
What's going on?

6543
03:25:49,740 --> 03:25:51,160
Are we getting a heart attack?

6544
03:25:51,620 --> 03:25:52,380
They're vibrating?

6545
03:25:53,260 --> 03:25:53,980
Whoa.

6546
03:25:54,520 --> 03:25:55,680
What's going on?

6547
03:25:55,740 --> 03:25:56,220
Is it because of the beer?

6548
03:25:59,280 --> 03:26:00,720
The decompression?

6549
03:26:00,960 --> 03:26:01,740
The decompression?

6550
03:26:01,780 --> 03:26:03,620
Is this the decompression?

6551
03:26:08,070 --> 03:26:10,150
Oh my god!

6552
03:26:10,230 --> 03:26:11,350
It's the beer!

6553
03:26:11,350 --> 03:26:13,510
I'm shaking a lot.

6554
03:26:13,890 --> 03:26:14,470
Shit!

6555
03:26:14,470 --> 03:26:14,550
Shit!

6556
03:26:14,850 --> 03:26:16,190
This is decompression sickness.

6557
03:26:17,150 --> 03:26:19,090
I swear to god!

6558
03:26:19,470 --> 03:26:22,590
You killed her in the end because of the decompression!

6559
03:26:22,590 --> 03:26:24,190
You killed her in the end because of the decompression!

6560
03:26:24,250 --> 03:26:25,930
Why are they vibrating?

6561
03:26:26,250 --> 03:26:27,210
Oh my god!

6562
03:26:28,650 --> 03:26:31,150
Oh my god!

6563
03:26:32,030 --> 03:26:32,790
Yeah!

6564
03:26:33,010 --> 03:26:35,670
We almost saved everybody!

6565
03:26:36,470 --> 03:26:37,950
She said congratulations.

6566
03:26:38,030 --> 03:26:39,810
We went through the credits.

6567
03:26:41,350 --> 03:26:42,110
Oh my god!

6568
03:26:42,250 --> 03:26:43,990
I can't believe it!

6569
03:26:44,070 --> 03:26:45,790
It was beer o'clock!

6570
03:26:45,930 --> 03:26:46,430
Please!

6571
03:26:47,850 --> 03:26:49,630
Beer o'clock!

6572
03:26:49,970 --> 03:26:53,570
Fucking beer o'clock!

6573
03:26:53,850 --> 03:26:57,210
We almost had a perfect run!

6574
03:26:57,470 --> 03:26:59,750
Fucking beer o'clock!

6575
03:27:00,210 --> 03:27:00,970
Beer o'clock!

6576
03:27:00,970 --> 03:27:01,510
I can't!

6577
03:27:05,310 --> 03:27:07,850
Oh my god!

6578
03:27:08,230 --> 03:27:09,990
Fucking beer o'clock!

6579
03:27:09,990 --> 03:27:11,190
Oh my god!

6580
03:27:11,190 --> 03:27:11,330
Fucking beer o'clock!

6581
03:27:16,290 --> 03:27:17,650
Oh my god!

6582
03:27:17,650 --> 03:27:19,730
Yeah, it was after the credits so it doesn't count.

6583
03:27:19,750 --> 03:27:21,190
Guys, it doesn't count!

6584
03:27:21,230 --> 03:27:22,570
It doesn't count, guys!

6585
03:27:22,590 --> 03:27:24,750
It was after the credits!

6586
03:27:25,070 --> 03:27:25,510
It doesn't count!

6587
03:27:26,470 --> 03:27:28,090
It doesn't count!

6588
03:27:30,890 --> 03:27:35,110
What happens after the credits is not our fault!

6589
03:27:36,070 --> 03:27:36,210
Oh my god!

6590
03:27:36,210 --> 03:27:37,850
Oh my god!

6591
03:27:37,850 --> 03:27:40,950
I can't believe it!

6592
03:27:43,490 --> 03:27:44,870
Oh my god!

6593
03:27:44,870 --> 03:27:45,450
Oh my god!

6594
03:27:45,550 --> 03:27:45,690
Oh my god!

6595
03:27:45,690 --> 03:27:48,130
She died from beer o'clock!

6596
03:27:48,750 --> 03:27:52,070
After everything we've been through!

6597
03:27:52,270 --> 03:27:53,170
After everything we've been through!

6598
03:27:53,170 --> 03:27:54,850
Fucking beer o'clock got us!

6599
03:27:55,150 --> 03:27:55,510
Fucking beer o'clock got us!

6600
03:27:55,510 --> 03:27:56,850
Oh my god!

6601
03:27:58,050 --> 03:27:59,730
Holy shit!

6602
03:28:00,450 --> 03:28:04,090
You know, I'm surprised everybody lived.

6603
03:28:04,330 --> 03:28:04,350
You know, I'm surprised everybody lived.

6604
03:28:04,350 --> 03:28:05,210
That was actually...

6605
03:28:05,210 --> 03:28:06,370
I'm surprised too!

6606
03:28:06,730 --> 03:28:07,530
Oh my god!

6607
03:28:08,010 --> 03:28:08,910
That's right!

6608
03:28:09,110 --> 03:28:10,130
We're special!

6609
03:28:10,370 --> 03:28:13,510
No other VTuber plays the game like us!

6610
03:28:14,110 --> 03:28:18,210
We stumbled our way into victory!

6611
03:28:18,750 --> 03:28:24,090
You can guarantee an original experience here on our channel!

6612
03:28:26,350 --> 03:28:27,270
You can guarantee an original experience here on our channel!

6613
03:28:27,270 --> 03:28:28,370
Beers of Medan!

6614
03:28:28,550 --> 03:28:32,570
I can't believe beer o'clock!

6615
03:28:32,770 --> 03:28:35,070
I can't believe beer o'clock!

6616
03:28:35,070 --> 03:28:37,210
I can't believe beer o'clock!

6617
03:28:37,210 --> 03:28:38,350
I can't believe beer o'clock!

6618
03:28:40,690 --> 03:28:43,330
Why did the decompression take so long?

6619
03:28:43,810 --> 03:28:48,490
He said it was like a couple hours or maybe a couple minutes.

6620
03:28:48,650 --> 03:28:49,170
Michael!

6621
03:28:50,130 --> 03:28:52,050
How did he die?

6622
03:28:52,190 --> 03:28:53,950
How did she die now?

6623
03:28:54,850 --> 03:28:56,250
Oh my god!

6624
03:28:57,330 --> 03:28:58,490
That was good.

6625
03:28:58,670 --> 03:28:59,310
That was good.

6626
03:28:59,450 --> 03:29:00,170
Did you like it, man?

6627
03:29:00,430 --> 03:29:00,630
That was fun!

6628
03:29:00,630 --> 03:29:01,070
That was really fun.

6629
03:29:01,310 --> 03:29:04,250
We should do the sequel to this next time.

6630
03:29:04,450 --> 03:29:07,150
Is the sequel the same where we have to play two different characters?

6631
03:29:07,470 --> 03:29:08,450
I think so, yeah.

6632
03:29:08,930 --> 03:29:11,190
I heard Little Hope's not as good though.

6633
03:29:11,330 --> 03:29:11,830
Oh yeah.

6634
03:29:11,870 --> 03:29:14,450
I think all of these are all kind of like, kuso games.

6635
03:29:14,510 --> 03:29:14,850
Yeah.

6636
03:29:18,750 --> 03:29:20,690
It's not the game, you guys.

6637
03:29:20,770 --> 03:29:21,730
It's who plays the game.

6638
03:29:21,810 --> 03:29:23,910
Yeah, it's who plays the game, guys.

6639
03:29:24,370 --> 03:29:25,590
Oh my god.

6640
03:29:25,730 --> 03:29:28,770
At least, hey, nobody died, okay?

6641
03:29:29,570 --> 03:29:30,610
Anything that happens, it's a game.

6642
03:29:30,630 --> 03:29:33,310
Anything that happens after the credits is not like our fault.

6643
03:29:33,570 --> 03:29:34,570
Yes, yes.

6644
03:29:34,750 --> 03:29:36,770
Anything that happens is not our fault.

6645
03:29:36,810 --> 03:29:38,950
Yeah, but it might not be B-Roll Clock.

6646
03:29:39,170 --> 03:29:40,590
It could have been something else.

6647
03:29:41,670 --> 03:29:43,230
It could have been.

6648
03:29:44,110 --> 03:29:45,650
No one important died.

6649
03:29:46,010 --> 03:29:46,790
That's true.

6650
03:29:46,950 --> 03:29:47,570
That's true.

6651
03:29:48,110 --> 03:29:50,170
Like, guys, Conrad's alive.

6652
03:29:50,290 --> 03:29:51,670
We probably saved Alex, you know?

6653
03:29:51,870 --> 03:29:53,090
Is Conrad alive?

6654
03:29:53,230 --> 03:29:54,770
Yeah, Conrad's alive, guys.

6655
03:29:55,490 --> 03:29:56,230
Conrad's alive.

6656
03:29:57,270 --> 03:30:00,610
Like how some of them are like, you were supposed to save that one kid next to us.

6657
03:30:00,630 --> 03:30:01,370
Yeah, yeah.

6658
03:30:01,370 --> 03:30:02,830
Like, he kidnapped us.

6659
03:30:02,970 --> 03:30:04,210
He kidnapped us!

6660
03:30:04,430 --> 03:30:05,310
He's a pirate!

6661
03:30:06,390 --> 03:30:07,890
Yeah, self-defense!

6662
03:30:08,230 --> 03:30:10,590
Yeah, it was either us or him.

6663
03:30:11,030 --> 03:30:11,470
Yeah.

6664
03:30:12,050 --> 03:30:12,350
Yeah.

6665
03:30:12,910 --> 03:30:16,870
Someone was like, it's a hallucination, she's alive.

6666
03:30:19,370 --> 03:30:21,430
She's still on the trip, on the ship.

6667
03:30:21,490 --> 03:30:22,250
She's like, Conrad!

6668
03:30:23,030 --> 03:30:24,490
I waited for you!

6669
03:30:24,990 --> 03:30:27,570
Someone was like, time of death, B-Roll Clock.

6670
03:30:28,530 --> 03:30:29,650
Someone was like, time of death, B-Roll Clock.

6671
03:30:32,670 --> 03:30:35,590
Oh my god, I didn't think that that would be...

6672
03:30:35,590 --> 03:30:37,610
You didn't think actions had consequences?

6673
03:30:38,350 --> 03:30:38,870
No.

6674
03:30:40,190 --> 03:30:45,610
After the doctor boyfriend was like, maybe you shouldn't drink the beer.

6675
03:30:47,390 --> 03:30:50,090
People are saying, don't do Little Hope that it's actually bad.

6676
03:30:50,170 --> 03:30:51,110
Oh, is it actually bad?

6677
03:30:52,150 --> 03:30:54,790
Wait, how many games are in the anthology?

6678
03:30:55,170 --> 03:30:55,690
Anyway.

6679
03:30:55,690 --> 03:30:57,150
Is House of Ashes apparently...

6680
03:30:57,150 --> 03:30:58,150
Is House of Ashes good?

6681
03:30:58,970 --> 03:31:01,770
Conrad survived up to the credits, therefore it doesn't matter.

6682
03:31:01,950 --> 03:31:02,570
So true!

6683
03:31:03,670 --> 03:31:04,570
So true.

6684
03:31:04,990 --> 03:31:07,510
I went very hard on those QuickTime events.

6685
03:31:12,750 --> 03:31:14,510
House of Ashes is good.

6686
03:31:14,730 --> 03:31:16,890
Okay, we'll do House of Ashes next.

6687
03:31:17,090 --> 03:31:18,750
Yeah, that was really fun.

6688
03:31:21,250 --> 03:31:23,250
How bad are we saying though?

6689
03:31:23,410 --> 03:31:25,090
Like, in what way is it bad?

6690
03:31:25,690 --> 03:31:26,390
Like, I mean...

6691
03:31:27,610 --> 03:31:29,690
Bad as in like the story bad?

6692
03:31:29,790 --> 03:31:30,670
Or is it like the...

6693
03:31:30,670 --> 03:31:32,870
Is it like buggy bad?

6694
03:31:33,630 --> 03:31:34,150
Yeah.

6695
03:31:34,910 --> 03:31:37,370
If it's buggy bad, then maybe not.

6696
03:31:37,450 --> 03:31:39,590
But if it's story bad, we can make it work.

6697
03:31:39,910 --> 03:31:41,370
I thought this one was great.

6698
03:31:41,710 --> 03:31:42,730
Yeah, this one was good.

6699
03:31:45,350 --> 03:31:47,010
This one was pretty good.

6700
03:31:48,230 --> 03:31:49,810
The story is terrible?

6701
03:31:50,110 --> 03:31:50,610
Oh, okay.

6702
03:31:50,710 --> 03:31:52,090
Then that's perfect for us.

6703
03:31:53,010 --> 03:31:53,530
Yeah!

6704
03:31:53,750 --> 03:31:54,270
Yeah!

6705
03:31:57,190 --> 03:32:01,890
I was trying to be a Mercier and then Min here was reading a diary in a British accent.

6706
03:32:02,070 --> 03:32:06,230
While we watched somebody get killed on screen.

6707
03:32:08,250 --> 03:32:09,810
It's like, dear diary.

6708
03:32:10,150 --> 03:32:12,290
And then my own voice was like, ahhhh!

6709
03:32:15,830 --> 03:32:16,930
You know, whatever.

6710
03:32:17,450 --> 03:32:18,910
Yeah, we'll fix it.

6711
03:32:18,970 --> 03:32:20,110
We can fix the story.

6712
03:32:22,190 --> 03:32:22,790
Don't worry.

6713
03:32:22,790 --> 03:32:25,810
And if the story is boring, we'll just make a podcast.

6714
03:32:27,250 --> 03:32:29,650
Open the Swift ending game.

6715
03:32:30,190 --> 03:32:31,970
It's not the game.

6716
03:32:32,010 --> 03:32:32,570
It's who plays it.

6717
03:32:32,570 --> 03:32:33,870
Yeah, it's who plays it.

6718
03:32:33,890 --> 03:32:34,310
Exactly.

6719
03:32:35,930 --> 03:32:37,590
What a great time.

6720
03:32:37,790 --> 03:32:39,690
We gotta continue the trilogy.

6721
03:32:39,930 --> 03:32:41,770
Yeah, we gotta continue the anthology.

6722
03:32:41,870 --> 03:32:42,830
The Dark Pictures.

6723
03:32:43,290 --> 03:32:46,010
Yeah, we have to continue the Dark Pictures anthology.

6724
03:32:48,430 --> 03:32:49,470
Oh, crap.

6725
03:32:50,050 --> 03:32:51,670
Well, thank you!

6726
03:32:51,870 --> 03:32:52,730
Yeah, thanks man.

6727
03:32:52,790 --> 03:32:54,770
I can't believe everybody lived.

6728
03:32:54,890 --> 03:32:56,590
Other than beer o'clock, I can't believe it.

6729
03:32:59,130 --> 03:33:03,900
I thought maybe she would die on the ship.

6730
03:33:03,980 --> 03:33:04,160
Yeah.

6731
03:33:04,160 --> 03:33:05,600
Like, oh my god, it's kicking in.

6732
03:33:05,760 --> 03:33:06,620
It's decompression.

6733
03:33:07,060 --> 03:33:07,880
Yeah, but no.

6734
03:33:07,960 --> 03:33:10,360
And that one decision you made.

6735
03:33:10,960 --> 03:33:13,120
She just collapses on the boat.

6736
03:33:13,160 --> 03:33:14,540
She died of cringe.

6737
03:33:19,140 --> 03:33:20,020
Oh man.

6738
03:33:20,260 --> 03:33:23,060
Oh my god, it just came out of nowhere too.

6739
03:33:23,060 --> 03:33:25,460
We were just like, yay, we did it.

6740
03:33:25,780 --> 03:33:28,900
Also, we weren't intentionally trying to save them.

6741
03:33:29,040 --> 03:33:29,680
We were just...

6742
03:33:29,680 --> 03:33:32,000
We just stumbled upon it.

6743
03:33:32,220 --> 03:33:32,780
Yeah.

6744
03:33:34,100 --> 03:33:38,240
We just tripped and fell into saving everybody somehow.

6745
03:33:41,760 --> 03:33:42,880
Yeah, somehow...

6746
03:33:42,880 --> 03:33:44,920
I mean, we did all the QTE.

6747
03:33:44,980 --> 03:33:46,120
Well, I failed the one QTE.

6748
03:33:46,300 --> 03:33:47,360
The heartbeat one.

6749
03:33:47,400 --> 03:33:48,040
We still lived.

6750
03:33:49,140 --> 03:33:49,700
One?

6751
03:33:49,940 --> 03:33:50,260
Whatever.

6752
03:33:53,060 --> 03:33:54,440
The one important one.

6753
03:33:54,680 --> 03:33:56,760
The one at the end.

6754
03:33:59,720 --> 03:34:00,360
Okay.

6755
03:34:00,760 --> 03:34:03,500
I see we're rewriting history right now.

6756
03:34:04,180 --> 03:34:05,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6757
03:34:06,420 --> 03:34:07,660
Yeah, the one.

6758
03:34:09,000 --> 03:34:12,320
I see you're not even paying attention to beer o'clock.

6759
03:34:14,120 --> 03:34:16,000
The most important one.

6760
03:34:16,020 --> 03:34:17,800
Beer o 'clock wouldn't have happened if...

6761
03:34:17,800 --> 03:34:19,000
I don't know.

6762
03:34:19,040 --> 03:34:20,980
You exploded the grill.

6763
03:34:21,140 --> 03:34:22,300
I literally just...

6764
03:34:22,300 --> 03:34:23,320
Don't do it.

6765
03:34:23,320 --> 03:34:24,960
Do not drink the beer.

6766
03:34:26,440 --> 03:34:27,480
It was...

6767
03:34:27,480 --> 03:34:28,920
It was just beer o'clock.

6768
03:34:29,660 --> 03:34:34,220
The doctor boyfriend was being like, that's a bad idea.

6769
03:34:36,760 --> 03:34:37,700
It was fun.

6770
03:34:37,720 --> 03:34:38,160
It was fine.

6771
03:34:38,380 --> 03:34:40,140
We didn't care about Julia anyway.

6772
03:34:40,700 --> 03:34:41,720
Yeah, that's true.

6773
03:34:41,900 --> 03:34:42,540
Yeah, she was...

6774
03:34:42,540 --> 03:34:43,000
She was...

6775
03:34:43,000 --> 03:34:45,300
Yeah, she was pretty much a Karen, to be fair.

6776
03:34:45,600 --> 03:34:46,180
She was.

6777
03:34:46,340 --> 03:34:46,680
Yeah.

6778
03:34:46,800 --> 03:34:48,740
So it's like, you know, nothing...

6779
03:34:48,740 --> 03:34:49,680
You know, he told...

6780
03:34:49,680 --> 03:34:50,800
Alex could have got...

6781
03:34:50,800 --> 03:34:52,160
Alex could have got...

6782
03:34:52,160 --> 03:34:53,140
He could have gotten a job so much better, you know?

6783
03:34:53,420 --> 03:34:53,900
Yeah.

6784
03:34:53,900 --> 03:34:54,340
Yeah.

6785
03:34:54,440 --> 03:34:55,080
And then Alex...

6786
03:34:55,080 --> 03:34:56,540
Yeah, we saved him from the marriage.

6787
03:34:56,580 --> 03:34:58,680
Now Alex is gonna fall in love with Flix.

6788
03:34:58,860 --> 03:34:59,560
Or Flix.

6789
03:34:59,560 --> 03:35:00,180
Yeah, Fliss.

6790
03:35:00,380 --> 03:35:00,860
Fliss.

6791
03:35:00,860 --> 03:35:01,100
Yeah.

6792
03:35:01,200 --> 03:35:01,560
Fliss, yeah.

6793
03:35:01,720 --> 03:35:03,660
Yeah, Fliss is so much better.

6794
03:35:03,720 --> 03:35:06,000
Yeah, Fliss almost got together with Conrad.

6795
03:35:06,940 --> 03:35:07,900
Oh my God.

6796
03:35:08,840 --> 03:35:10,120
They were making out.

6797
03:35:10,340 --> 03:35:11,220
Yeah, yeah.

6798
03:35:11,460 --> 03:35:12,940
And then we saved them.

6799
03:35:13,040 --> 03:35:13,540
We got...

6800
03:35:13,540 --> 03:35:15,340
We got Fliss for Alex now.

6801
03:35:15,660 --> 03:35:16,840
She's a strong woman.

6802
03:35:17,280 --> 03:35:20,940
I can't believe Conrad just literally like front of the boat, like...

6803
03:35:20,940 --> 03:35:21,980
Yeah, we're...

6804
03:35:21,980 --> 03:35:22,140
We're just...

6805
03:35:22,140 --> 03:35:22,980
What if Fliss is the coast guard?

6806
03:35:23,160 --> 03:35:23,360
I don't know.

6807
03:35:23,360 --> 03:35:24,640
Like he just went there by himself.

6808
03:35:24,980 --> 03:35:25,840
I don't know.

6809
03:35:26,060 --> 03:35:27,800
He was clearly not driving the boat.

6810
03:35:28,100 --> 03:35:28,520
No.

6811
03:35:28,540 --> 03:35:30,200
Yeah, so it makes this...

6812
03:35:30,200 --> 03:35:31,480
Why is he dealing with this?

6813
03:35:31,540 --> 03:35:32,440
Yeah, it's like where did...

6814
03:35:32,440 --> 03:35:32,940
Where did the...

6815
03:35:32,940 --> 03:35:34,460
Where did the coast guard go?

6816
03:35:34,760 --> 03:35:35,100
I...

6817
03:35:35,100 --> 03:35:37,400
Also, how did he get the coordinates?

6818
03:35:37,980 --> 03:35:39,600
I was like, yeah.

6819
03:35:39,940 --> 03:35:40,400
Why...

6820
03:35:40,400 --> 03:35:41,960
Why did he get the coordinates?

6821
03:35:42,060 --> 03:35:44,380
Well, we gave the coordinates over the...

6822
03:35:44,380 --> 03:35:45,420
Over the radio...

6823
03:35:45,420 --> 03:35:45,600
Yeah.

6824
03:35:45,600 --> 03:35:47,420
But how did he know to go with...

6825
03:35:47,420 --> 03:35:47,760
Like...

6826
03:35:47,760 --> 03:35:48,160
How...

6827
03:35:48,160 --> 03:35:48,440
What?

6828
03:35:48,440 --> 03:35:50,040
Yeah, but then like the thing is...

6829
03:35:50,040 --> 03:35:50,420
He...

6830
03:35:50,420 --> 03:35:51,040
They were...

6831
03:35:51,040 --> 03:35:51,960
They were on the...

6832
03:35:51,960 --> 03:35:52,120
Oh, my gosh.

6833
03:35:52,140 --> 03:35:52,900
They weren't on the military boat.

6834
03:35:53,020 --> 03:35:53,620
They weren't on the...

6835
03:35:53,620 --> 03:35:54,060
Yeah, exactly!

6836
03:35:54,600 --> 03:35:56,620
Everybody else was also on the military boat.

6837
03:35:56,940 --> 03:35:57,420
Yeah!

6838
03:35:57,840 --> 03:35:59,740
So like... I'm so confused.

6839
03:36:00,040 --> 03:36:01,940
Why was there nobody behind?

6840
03:36:02,400 --> 03:36:08,260
Oh my god...

6841
03:36:09,000 --> 03:36:09,780
It's alright.

6842
03:36:09,940 --> 03:36:10,660
Everybody lived.

6843
03:36:10,820 --> 03:36:13,460
Everything that happens after credits was a hallucination.

6844
03:36:13,680 --> 03:36:17,240
Someone said if you don't get the distributor cap, you get rescued by the Coast Guard.

6845
03:36:17,440 --> 03:36:17,980
Oh!

6846
03:36:18,960 --> 03:36:20,600
So you picked up the...

6847
03:36:23,030 --> 03:36:25,890
You told us... You told me to pick up the cap!

6848
03:36:29,340 --> 03:36:33,640
Okay, but like... If we picked up the cap, then like...

6849
03:36:33,640 --> 03:36:34,500
Then like... Would...

6850
03:36:34,500 --> 03:36:35,980
Doki killed Conrad.

6851
03:36:36,020 --> 03:36:37,280
Would Conrad be on the boat?

6852
03:36:37,420 --> 03:36:38,020
Doki killed Conrad.

6853
03:36:38,340 --> 03:36:40,620
Would Conrad be on the boat and see them?

6854
03:36:40,980 --> 03:36:43,100
He'd be on the boat and then be like, Oh my god!

6855
03:36:43,160 --> 03:36:44,860
We're rescuing you guys!

6856
03:36:45,240 --> 03:36:46,320
Okay, I think we're getting gaslit.

6857
03:36:46,520 --> 03:36:49,320
I think we were supposed to get... I think we were supposed to...

6858
03:36:50,120 --> 03:36:51,420
Supposed to pick it up.

6859
03:36:52,400 --> 03:36:53,380
I don't know.

6860
03:36:53,740 --> 03:36:54,180
I think we're being...

6861
03:36:54,200 --> 03:36:55,380
We're supposed to pick it up.

6862
03:36:55,400 --> 03:36:55,980
I'm pretty sure.

6863
03:36:56,260 --> 03:36:58,600
No, because we called the Coast Guard.

6864
03:36:58,680 --> 03:36:59,160
They were coming.

6865
03:36:59,300 --> 03:36:59,900
They were on their way.

6866
03:37:00,160 --> 03:37:01,660
This cannot be on me.

6867
03:37:06,480 --> 03:37:07,400
Wait, so...

6868
03:37:07,400 --> 03:37:13,340
So like... If we didn't pick up the distributor cap, we would have seen Conrad on the boat?

6869
03:37:13,520 --> 03:37:14,540
And it would be like, Conrad!

6870
03:37:15,120 --> 03:37:15,980
I think so.

6871
03:37:16,580 --> 03:37:17,800
Yeah, they were on their way.

6872
03:37:17,900 --> 03:37:20,060
Someone said not picking up gives you the better ending.

6873
03:37:20,220 --> 03:37:21,780
How do I not pick it up?

6874
03:37:22,040 --> 03:37:23,660
Do I just like not do it?

6875
03:37:23,800 --> 03:37:24,060
Like...

6876
03:37:24,060 --> 03:37:25,180
I don't know what you said.

6877
03:37:25,520 --> 03:37:27,480
How do I not pick up the cap?

6878
03:37:29,840 --> 03:37:31,940
Oh, they would have ran into each other.

6879
03:37:32,020 --> 03:37:34,720
Guys, I gave you guys a different... I gave you guys a cooler ending, okay?

6880
03:37:35,020 --> 03:37:36,100
Yeah, the cooler...

6881
03:37:36,100 --> 03:37:38,240
Actually, the ending we got was so crazy.

6882
03:37:38,280 --> 03:37:41,300
Yeah, the ending we got was so much better, guys.

6883
03:37:41,400 --> 03:37:44,080
It was actually so much better.

6884
03:37:46,420 --> 03:37:50,520
Like, do you guys really want to get rescued by Conrad?

6885
03:37:50,820 --> 03:37:51,440
Come on.

6886
03:37:52,500 --> 03:37:54,040
Someone was like, you got the better ending.

6887
03:37:54,040 --> 03:37:57,360
Now the world is protected by... from Conrad's frizz.

6888
03:37:59,460 --> 03:38:01,520
We took out both of the siblings.

6889
03:38:01,740 --> 03:38:02,140
It's fine.

6890
03:38:02,200 --> 03:38:05,260
Yeah, we got a... we got a two for one special.

6891
03:38:05,980 --> 03:38:06,420
Great.

6892
03:38:07,280 --> 03:38:08,560
Anyway, thank you, Dokie.

6893
03:38:08,620 --> 03:38:09,400
This was a good time.

6894
03:38:09,460 --> 03:38:10,500
Yeah, that was a good time.

6895
03:38:10,800 --> 03:38:11,600
GGs, man.

6896
03:38:11,780 --> 03:38:14,380
We'll come back for the next... what was it?

6897
03:38:14,380 --> 03:38:16,320
Little Hope or House of...

6898
03:38:16,320 --> 03:38:18,280
Whatever one we decide to play, I guess.

6899
03:38:18,280 --> 03:38:19,700
Yeah, yeah, we'll come back to that.

6900
03:38:19,920 --> 03:38:20,360
GGs.

6901
03:38:20,500 --> 03:38:22,540
Alright, we're going to talk to our chats now.

6902
03:38:22,880 --> 03:38:23,120
Yeah.

6903
03:38:23,120 --> 03:38:24,880
Alright, see you, man.

6904
03:38:25,260 --> 03:38:25,940
Bye-bye.

6905
03:38:26,660 --> 03:38:27,220
Bye.

6906
03:38:28,660 --> 03:38:29,680
Oh my god.

6907
03:38:29,880 --> 03:38:31,580
I'm the Peter O'Clock.

6908
03:38:31,900 --> 03:38:34,780
Guys, you can't be sad about losing Conrad.

6909
03:38:34,920 --> 03:38:36,260
It's fucking Conrad.

6910
03:38:36,360 --> 03:38:37,300
Don't lie to me.

6911
03:38:37,500 --> 03:38:40,180
You guys are not actually sad about losing Conrad.

6912
03:38:42,480 --> 03:38:46,240
Don't... don't... I know you guys don't actually care about him.

6913
03:38:46,320 --> 03:38:52,300
You guys were like, no, Dokie, why did you save Conrad?

6914
03:38:53,440 --> 03:38:53,840
No!

6915
03:38:55,760 --> 03:38:59,680
Don't pretend you cared about Conrad this entire time.

6916
03:39:00,160 --> 03:39:02,000
I know that's not true.

6917
03:39:03,120 --> 03:39:06,000
I'm trying to find our chat overlay right now.

6918
03:39:06,020 --> 03:39:06,500
There it is.

6919
03:39:06,860 --> 03:39:07,260
Yeah.

6920
03:39:08,380 --> 03:39:08,780
Yeehaw.

6921
03:39:08,860 --> 03:39:09,360
What the fuck?

6922
03:39:09,400 --> 03:39:10,080
Okay, yeehaw.

6923
03:39:10,840 --> 03:39:11,580
Oh my god.

6924
03:39:11,660 --> 03:39:13,940
I'm waiting for Zynga, man.

6925
03:39:13,960 --> 03:39:14,820
That was fun, though.

6926
03:39:14,840 --> 03:39:15,440
I had a lot of fun.

6927
03:39:16,300 --> 03:39:16,700
Um...

6928
03:39:17,540 --> 03:39:18,080
Let's see.

6929
03:39:18,200 --> 03:39:19,180
Fado, thank you for the super chat.

6930
03:39:19,240 --> 03:39:19,760
Thank you, thank you.

6931
03:39:19,780 --> 03:39:23,100
Why didn't anyone use the boat radio to contact the Coast Guard and tell them that they're okay?

6932
03:39:23,100 --> 03:39:26,120
Okay, now they get the super chat because the radio died.

6933
03:39:27,020 --> 03:39:30,320
Oh, that was really, really, really fun.

6934
03:39:30,640 --> 03:39:34,440
I definitely had a great time playing with Mint today.

6935
03:39:34,840 --> 03:39:37,480
Um, I'm glad we chose Madame Adon.

6936
03:39:37,700 --> 03:39:41,020
It was one of the games that we were never able to actually play in the past.

6937
03:39:41,100 --> 03:39:42,620
So we were like, oh my god, let's play it.

6938
03:39:42,640 --> 03:39:44,920
Let's actually play this game now that we can.

6939
03:39:47,880 --> 03:39:49,000
I'm glad we did.

6940
03:39:49,220 --> 03:39:50,240
I'm glad we did.

6941
03:39:50,240 --> 03:39:54,720
Um, it was... I never... I didn't expect how it was gonna go.

6942
03:39:55,680 --> 03:39:58,520
And so, like, everything was such a surprise.

6943
03:39:58,820 --> 03:40:00,800
Like, the decisions that we made.

6944
03:40:01,700 --> 03:40:01,980
Um...

6945
03:40:02,340 --> 03:40:03,340
Nexy, thank you for the super chat.

6946
03:40:03,380 --> 03:40:03,920
Thank you, thank you.

6947
03:40:04,020 --> 03:40:05,180
That was a super fun collab.

6948
03:40:05,400 --> 03:40:06,500
Thank you so much for the stream, Doki.

6949
03:40:06,540 --> 03:40:07,160
Thank you for the super chat.

6950
03:40:07,220 --> 03:40:07,700
Thank you, thank you.

6951
03:40:07,720 --> 03:40:08,540
Yeah, I had so much fun.

6952
03:40:09,060 --> 03:40:12,480
Oh, I wish I could talk to you guys more, but my throat is dying right now.

6953
03:40:12,540 --> 03:40:14,360
So, I'm gonna have to call it here, everybody.

6954
03:40:14,940 --> 03:40:16,900
Um, but like I said, it was incredibly fun.

6955
03:40:17,120 --> 03:40:19,200
I had a great time with Mint and I had a great time with you guys, Dragones.

6956
03:40:19,200 --> 03:40:21,000
And also the... the Wisp as well.

6957
03:40:21,140 --> 03:40:23,000
So, I'm gonna call it here, everybody.

6958
03:40:23,400 --> 03:40:26,400
Um, so my voice can relax a little bit.

6959
03:40:26,540 --> 03:40:29,660
But, as always, everybody, stay hydrated, posture check.

6960
03:40:29,780 --> 03:40:31,620
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

6961
03:40:31,740 --> 03:40:33,640
And if you sit up for me, head to bed.

6962
03:40:33,800 --> 03:40:34,840
Cause you deserve it.

6963
03:40:35,040 --> 03:40:35,940
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

6964
03:40:36,940 --> 03:40:37,660
Bye, guys.

6965
03:40:38,400 --> 03:40:39,200
Mmm... Bye!

6966
03:40:41,280 --> 03:40:42,560
I need to find the ending stream.

6967
03:40:42,780 --> 03:40:43,100
Haha!

6968
03:40:43,480 --> 03:40:43,880
Bye!
