1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,840
Wait, wait, wait.

2
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:02,140
Yeah, I don't think I have any words.

3
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:07,160
I literally have never played Game of Life.

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,300
It's literally life!

5
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:11,540
Okay, basically, you can go to college or don't.

6
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:13,460
But you go to college, you get into debt.

7
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:15,140
And then you can have kids.

8
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,180
Oh, you're forced to have kids, by the way.

9
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,600
You're forced to get married and have kids.

10
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:25,020
Yeah, so...

11
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,440
So, like, basically, it's life.

12
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:29,020
Basically.

13
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:31,900
But we're all chronically online, so it's like...

14
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:36,660
You get to experience what it's like to have, like, an actual life outside of streaming.

15
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:39,720
That's basically it.

16
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:41,180
Wait, let me just...

17
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:42,620
I thought this was like Monopoly!

18
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:45,280
It's two different keys!

19
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:47,680
You can't buy a house though, can't you?

20
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:48,340
I'm pretty sure.

21
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:50,220
Well, you can.

22
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,520
You can technically have a house, but it's like one house.

23
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:55,020
Oh my god.

24
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:59,820
Okay, I have your, like, VOD Ninja bow.

25
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,920
Okay, the quality, like, re-stabilized.

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,500
It was like 220p or some shit earlier.

27
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:07,440
Yeah, it's really wonky at first.

28
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:10,560
Sometimes it'll, like, poop itself, but then it'll come back.

29
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:11,940
It's kind of like Discord audio.

30
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:12,780
Yeah, yeah, alright.

31
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,400
Where's the chroma key?

32
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:15,860
Alright, green.

33
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:16,820
Hello!

34
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,580
Oh my god, you're so loud!

35
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,040
I'm powerful!

36
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,580
Also, I'm live!

37
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:24,800
Yeah, yeah, we're all live.

38
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:25,960
We're all live?

39
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,000
We're all live except for Doobie.

40
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,720
You are so loud, Fillion.

41
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:31,900
I'm not loud!

42
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,920
Oh my god, I need to turn you down.

43
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,920
I put you at 70.

44
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,880
Yeah, yeah, I literally put you...

45
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,180
I had her at 200 from our last thing we did together.

46
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,260
So, what happened to my mic, huh?

47
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,500
You just want to act mean to me on stream.

48
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:49,160
Wait, wait, Fillion, where's your VOD Ninja thing?

49
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:51,000
Yeah, of course, of course.

50
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,280
We all did the assignment that you gave us.

51
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,000
My assignment is going to be...

52
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,700
We all did the assignment.

53
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,580
Give me a second, you're putting pressure on me.

54
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,640
Frick you.

55
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,660
Listen, my internet is just not good enough for it, you know?

56
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,220
What do you mean?

57
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,200
Your entire thing is about 3D.

58
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,980
Yeah, I'm giving it to you right now.

59
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:10,040
What?

60
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,160
Oh yeah, yeah.

61
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,060
Oh yeah, I put the lobby code so you can join whenever.

62
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:19,920
Wait, you did everything?

63
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,960
What do you mean?

64
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,440
I was going to do this.

65
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,960
You're just taking my job.

66
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,020
Okay, I bought the deluxe.

67
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,000
I had the deluxe version, which was like $100, but I had it before.

68
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:33,540
So...

69
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,980
So, like, it basically...

70
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,980
I just like to revisit this conversation.

71
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,000
Well, the thing is...

72
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,080
Bow, the thing is, I'm not in debt, so I could afford it.

73
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:49,320
See, that's where all the thinking starts.

74
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,840
Yeah, like, I can...

75
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,980
I can afford it because I'm not in debt, Bow.

76
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,160
That's the thing.

77
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,880
Well, are you going to go for college route, Bow, then?

78
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:01,680
Are you going to go to college?

79
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,680
No, I'm just going to buy a bunch of houses.

80
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,460
You can only buy one house!

81
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:07,520
This is not Monopoly!

82
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,380
What do you mean a bunch?

83
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:11,980
You can only buy one!

84
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,160
She hasn't, no.

85
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:16,120
It's okay.

86
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:20,440
It's okay, Bow is going to know what actual real life is outside the internet today.

87
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,720
Yeah, we get to experience what it's like.

88
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,800
Yeah, that's the game of life.

89
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,880
I think the Mark Zuckerberg...

90
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,100
I'm pretty sure Metaverse died.

91
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,180
Yes, don't leak it.

92
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,260
Do not leak the code.

93
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,560
I do not leak the code.

94
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,340
Until the lobby is full.

95
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:59,080
There's a grey line at the top.

96
00:03:59,280 --> 00:03:59,360
Where?

97
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:02,900
Oh, I see it.

98
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:10,660
I mean, I could just create a new lobby and you leak it, but I prefer not to.

99
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:16,300
Let's not leak, I don't see anybody.

100
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,740
Yeah, I just see you and...

101
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:19,680
I just see...

102
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,940
Doobie's the only one that joined the collab.

103
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,680
Wait, okay, okay, okay.

104
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,740
I dropped my code, okay?

105
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,600
I'm a little bit behind.

106
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:27,660
I did my job, okay?

107
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,300
You literally organized this collab, Elliot.

108
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,140
Too busy on Omegle.

109
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,780
Too busy on VTuber Omegle.

110
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:41,060
VTuber Omegle.

111
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:42,960
Yeah, yeah.

112
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,400
Doobie was watching the VTuber Omegle and was commenting.

113
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,860
What do you think, Doobie?

114
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,760
Pretty cool, huh?

115
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:53,420
Yeah, it's cool, but I'm worried where somebody's doing something weird behind, you know, the exact thing.

116
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,060
I don't know.

117
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,760
Here's Omegle.

118
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,720
Here's the thing, okay?

119
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,360
They can only use their VTube model.

120
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:01,600
Yeah, but you can literally Google a picture.

121
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,180
You can Google a picture.

122
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:05,000
But they...

123
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,660
Oh, you're right.

124
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,580
You can Google a picture.

125
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,420
Oh my god, you just walked in.

126
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,220
I'm just gonna make you look tiny on my head.

127
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,780
I'm just gonna put you on my head.

128
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,600
What do you mean, Doobie?

129
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,320
She's not even streaming.

130
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,160
I'm the one messing us up.

131
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:32,740
We're both blonde.

132
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:33,220
Is that why?

133
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:33,820
Is that why?

134
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,000
You can't see it.

135
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,520
The color yellow.

136
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:39,900
I can't see anything.

137
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,440
I'm the angel.

138
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:43,260
She's the devil.

139
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,220
Okay, I'll put you...

140
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,660
Okay, so...

141
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:51,980
I'm going to hop on to the game.

142
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:52,440
Alright?

143
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,360
Yeah, the code is out.

144
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:55,760
The code is out?

145
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:57,600
Yeah, it is.

146
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,740
It's literally in the chat.

147
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:02,220
Don't say the code out loud.

148
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:05,680
Well, to be fair, Bao's not even in it yet too.

149
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:06,960
I'm coming.

150
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,800
I'm coming.

151
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,840
I know where to put Fillion.

152
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:17,300
She's like walking everywhere.

153
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,980
I will pick my position and then we'll be chilling, okay?

154
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:23,440
I promise.

155
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,140
Video Ninja?

156
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:26,540
Copy.

157
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:31,240
Okay, I'm bringing you on Bao right now.

158
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:32,860
Alright.

159
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,300
Yippee, I'm in.

160
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:37,060
Guys, at least we didn't start 30 minutes late.

161
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,320
That's like an improvement for VTubers.

162
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,640
We were on time!

163
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,100
Isn't that crazy?

164
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:49,860
We didn't start the game on time, but small steps, you know?

165
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:56,520
You guys are the biggest video window ninjas I've ever seen in my life.

166
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:01,740
Why is your background like an effing navy blue?

167
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,060
Because it's the default!

168
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,200
What happened to green?

169
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,140
I just...

170
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:09,300
It's literally default.

171
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,340
You can figure it out.

172
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,020
Just color drop it.

173
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,020
I think I'm behind Doki right now.

174
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,520
I can't tell where I am because you're effing...

175
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,480
Blue window is murder.

176
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,240
Where do I put her?

177
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,080
Oh my god, where do I put her, guys?

178
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,420
I don't even know.

179
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,140
I also don't know.

180
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,600
I just put her right next to you guys.

181
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,940
I think she's walking everywhere.

182
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,720
Bro, your jacket is half of this world.

183
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:36,860
I put my jump to zero.

184
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,160
What if we put...

185
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,940
Maybe I should just use a PNG.

186
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,660
I forced her to be 2D.

187
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,360
I have to be slightly green.

188
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,960
Come on, man.

189
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,440
Wait, don't leave me up here.

190
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,300
You know what the Fillion ninja reminds me of?

191
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:59,800
It's like those ads that pop up on Nickelodeon on the bottom right.

192
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,380
And they just come out.

193
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,400
That's what she reminds me of right now.

194
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,160
Next up on Nickelodeon.

195
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:07,300
Spongebob.

196
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:08,640
And she's just moving around.

197
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,580
Bro, you are literally invisible on my screen.

198
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,800
I don't know what to do with you.

199
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,140
I just put the similarity down.

200
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,020
Bro, I did!

201
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,500
I clicked pick screen color.

202
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,620
I clicked on you.

203
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:26,120
Oh, yeah, true.

204
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:26,960
Doobie would know.

205
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,000
She knows all the technology stuff.

206
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,300
I actually realized I did make a strategic error.

207
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:32,160
Yeah, huge.

208
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:34,120
What is it?

209
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:35,640
Did that fix it?

210
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:36,720
No, that made it worse.

211
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,320
You can make it 0.1?

212
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:38,940
Yeah.

213
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,100
That didn't work at all.

214
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:45,700
Wait, Bow, you were able to figure it out, right?

215
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:46,860
Yeah.

216
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,840
I'm gonna make you into a ghost jacket.

217
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,480
Bow was able to figure it out.

218
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:52,920
Ninja is your thing.

219
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:56,380
Okay, Bow, what's your secret sauce?

220
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:57,380
Okay.

221
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,240
You can pick screen color.

222
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,780
And then whatever the background...

223
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:02,960
Yeah.

224
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,840
It'll just make it disappear.

225
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,840
How many years have you been using Ninja?

226
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,360
Uh, well...

227
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,280
Here's the thing.

228
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,120
I can explain.

229
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,540
So, what happened was that...

230
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:21,500
When I was picking a custom color...

231
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:21,820
Yeah?

232
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,660
Well, I'm actually colorblind.

233
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:25,940
Oh, wait, really?

234
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,460
You're colorblind?

235
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,640
She's literally lying, bro.

236
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,820
No, it's like...

237
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:34,900
If you make fun of me, you're really bullying a disabled human.

238
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,220
How do you feel about that one?

239
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,220
He got fact-checked.

240
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,740
You can't say that!

241
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,940
Can we have a note from your doctor or something?

242
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,080
Yeah, of course.

243
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:46,600
Please share a doctor's note before making these claims.

244
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,780
My entire chat is my doctor.

245
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,120
They're like a part of my mind.

246
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:52,040
It's like chat is my therapist.

247
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,000
That's like not...

248
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,600
They are!

249
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,420
Come on, let's be honest, guys.

250
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,180
Chat is our therapist.

251
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,800
At least one of them should be a licensed therapist.

252
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,880
But, like, I don't know which one it is.

253
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:04,160
I mean, to be fair, I get lawyers...

254
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,420
It's like asking chat for legal advice.

255
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:10,080
Dude, I do ask them for legal advice!

256
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,480
Oh, no.

257
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,940
Dude, I said, should I give away 100 subs?

258
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,600
And they said yes, and now I'm broke.

259
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:16,880
No, no, Fillion.

260
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,440
I did it for my family.

261
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,300
This explains so much about your career.

262
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,080
Whatever.

263
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,960
What's in your chat?

264
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,880
Uh, no, no.

265
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,900
That's kind of freaked out, bro.

266
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:39,700
I'm like trying to make Doki fully transparent.

267
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:40,880
Wait, what?

268
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,720
Doki, Doki, Doki, listen to me, okay?

269
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:48,260
I know you're in a literature club, but I need you to stop becoming a ghost.

270
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:49,340
What?

271
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:50,580
You're a bachelor!

272
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:54,020
Do anything for the cause!

273
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,540
It's literally just you.

274
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:00,360
Is she freaked up too on your screen?

275
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,820
It was fine, and then it got freaked up.

276
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,000
Wait, how?

277
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:05,240
I don't know.

278
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,500
Okay, alright.

279
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,280
I'll disappear for a second.

280
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,280
You're just enabling her, Bal.

281
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:10,880
You know it.

282
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,500
No, I'm not.

283
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,840
She won't learn!

284
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,620
She won't learn if you stop, if you enable her.

285
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:21,280
I'm not enabling her.

286
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,920
She won't learn.

287
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,860
And you know it.

288
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,500
She just told me I could buy multiple houses.

289
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:29,000
Bal, check your PayPal.

290
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:33,880
Okay, have you guys ever bribed someone for content?

291
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:34,780
No!

292
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,700
What in the world?

293
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,040
Okay, well, we're going to be playing the game of life today.

294
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,980
We're not a reality show, we're real.

295
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,440
Girls, my DMs are open.

296
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:44,800
Okay?

297
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:47,800
If you want the W in this game, I am a professional at life.

298
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,840
Oh, gosh.

299
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,600
I've done life very good.

300
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,120
So you can just hit me up, and I'll make sure you're good.

301
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:54,240
Any believers?

302
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,700
Any believers in chat?

303
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,760
Even Doobie doesn't believe you, and this is her first collab with you.

304
00:11:58,940 --> 00:11:59,660
I'm considering it.

305
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,500
You're considered Doobie?

306
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,220
No, don't listen to the devil.

307
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,840
Why are you calling me devil?

308
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:08,960
Don't listen to...

309
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:12,480
Well, she's not calling you an angel.

310
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:13,740
Yeah.

311
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:17,600
You're like the snake in Adam and Eve.

312
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,740
That is so mean!

313
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:21,360
Bro!

314
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:24,060
Snakes are cool, but they're cool.

315
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,920
You're talking a lot of smack.

316
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,600
We're being a walking piece of KFC.

317
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,940
KFC, you effing chicken looking thing.

318
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:29,720
Huh?

319
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,740
What's up?

320
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,820
Technically, we're all animals.

321
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,580
Except, I think Fillion's a fake cat girl.

322
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:36,400
She's not real.

323
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,240
Just a furry?

324
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,280
Yeah, she's just a furry.

325
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,900
I prefer the term cosplayer.

326
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,400
I'm a cosplayer.

327
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,960
Just every single day of your life.

328
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:49,640
Every day with a tail up your ass?

329
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:50,940
Yeah, that's cosplay.

330
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,480
Here's the thing.

331
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,800
Okay, Doki?

332
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,580
I'm gonna say this right now.

333
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,560
You're talking about my tail?

334
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,980
Let's talk about your neck.

335
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,320
What's wrong with my neck?

336
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:05,960
Your neck is longer than my patience right now.

337
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,560
Okay, it doesn't take that much though, to be fair.

338
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:12,660
If I needed tomorrow's weather forecast, I'd tell you to look behind your shoulder.

339
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:17,440
You are a walking Alolan executor.

340
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,360
Executor is pretty cool though.

341
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,520
He is.

342
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,560
It is pretty cool.

343
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,180
I feel like those are just compliments right now.

344
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,260
Thank you.

345
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,320
Bro, you wanna be a vegetative creature when you grow up?

346
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,600
Executor is the coolest Pokemon out there.

347
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:34,920
Like, look at him.

348
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:35,520
It's true.

349
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:37,340
Have you ever seen giraffe fights?

350
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,220
They're actually so hardcore.

351
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,360
They get their necks done.

352
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,400
They smack people with their necks.

353
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,960
That dude's actually kinda sick, I'm not gonna lie.

354
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,300
Yeah, okay, you know who's missing in my lobby?

355
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,720
There's one person missing.

356
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,500
Let's take a guess on who it is.

357
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,260
Who is it?

358
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:56,960
Who could it be?

359
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,400
I'm in the game!

360
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,240
I'm in the game!

361
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:01,460
You're not in the lobby!

362
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,660
Okay, give me one sec.

363
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,280
I can do this.

364
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:08,860
How do I...

365
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:09,200
Here?

366
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,080
Doki, I have a special request.

367
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,080
There's a code.

368
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,680
Scroll up.

369
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:16,900
Just scroll.

370
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,840
What the...

371
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,620
That one?

372
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,400
Yeah, like...

373
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,320
Wait, Doobie, Doobie!

374
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:27,340
Can you do a cool face too?

375
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:29,800
Uh...

376
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,920
I saw Bao's face.

377
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:38,960
I like that.

378
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,280
Bao, you do a funny face now!

379
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,380
No, she's been doing a funny face.

380
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,500
Wait, that's so cute.

381
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:50,440
Yeah.

382
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,420
I can do a funny face too.

383
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,460
Wait, don't...

384
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:57,160
Aren't you doing one all the time?

385
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:58,400
Yeah, aren't you...

386
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:01,220
No, no, no, no, no.

387
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,020
Wrong outfit, wrong outfit.

388
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:04,480
Furry!

389
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:05,540
Stop!

390
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,240
If you're not a furry, take off your ears right now.

391
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:13,140
She's literally in like a Chester the cheetah outfit right now.

392
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:14,080
Wait, really?

393
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,260
I'm not a furry!

394
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,520
Take off my ears?

395
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,060
Yeah, take off your ears right now.

396
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,820
How am I supposed to do that?

397
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,680
Oh, well, furry.

398
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,920
No, no, no, okay, fine, fine.

399
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,680
Take off your ears right...

400
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,280
Oh, you can't take it off.

401
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,080
No, I can do this.

402
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:34,160
The hardest wills require the strongest sacrifices.

403
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:37,820
Fuck you.

404
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,320
Oh my god.

405
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:43,080
She really does look like the Spongebob ad right now.

406
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:49,420
She's like the Nickelodeon next up on Spongebob Squarepants.

407
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,580
Oh, yeah, when the characters like walk on the screen.

408
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:52,960
Yeah, yeah, that's what...

409
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:53,620
I get it.

410
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:57,480
It looks like a halftime transition stinger for a TV show.

411
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,980
Yeah, you look like a stinger on a TV show.

412
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,020
Okay.

413
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,140
I just got a rate up on my face right now.

414
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:06,640
I just need a text to go over it.

415
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,360
Oh my god, live on stream.

416
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,320
Hear it.

417
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:20,280
You know, maybe we could just put a computer as our foreplayer.

418
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,740
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

419
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:24,600
No, no, no, I'm joining the lobby, bro.

420
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:26,540
Relax, okay?

421
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,140
Relax, calm down.

422
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,260
Alright, let's see this junk.

423
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,800
Bink, bink, and then here.

424
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,800
Music on.

425
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,840
I turned on my music because I'm a chad.

426
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:35,640
How about you guys?

427
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,440
What, the music from the game?

428
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:38,160
Yeah.

429
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:41,280
Yeah, no, I've been listening to the same music for 10 plus minutes.

430
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:42,620
20 minutes, actually.

431
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,820
Yeah, I'm like losing it.

432
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,520
Yeah, no, this is like similar to Pico Park right now.

433
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,980
It's just one track.

434
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,280
It's literally one track of song.

435
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,800
Okay, if I enter the lobby code, we'll get leaked.

436
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:55,400
Yes.

437
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,320
Walk the code.

438
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:02,060
I don't know, your chat might be faster at typing this than you.

439
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:07,980
Type it in and then you can show it because it'll be a full lobby.

440
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:11,080
Wait, so I have permission to leak the code?

441
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:16,420
No, you have permission after you've typed it in and got in because then your chat might be faster.

442
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:17,640
Okay, okay, okay.

443
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,280
Now, everybody can leak the code, guys.

444
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:22,000
You can all leak the code.

445
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:24,200
The code is 7284.

446
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:28,380
If you don't grab my IP, I'm going to be severely disappointed.

447
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:34,060
If anybody shows up at my house, because I'm the lobby leader, fill in.

448
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,800
Oh, oh, no, I'm sorry.

449
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:39,120
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

450
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,420
And we're starting the game.

451
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, start the game, start the game, start the game, start the game.

452
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,800
We're starting the game.

453
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,560
Alright, I chose the space map.

454
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,780
I thought it would be appropriate.

455
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,120
Yeah.

456
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:56,260
We're gonna go to Mars, everybody.

457
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,240
Whoa.

458
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,320
I'm a better seagull.

459
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,760
Look at me and my furries right here.

460
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:06,120
Wait, dude, you gotta do outfit color coordinate.

461
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:07,980
I'm an effing marsupial in space.

462
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,060
We're literally in space.

463
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,080
If anybody, you guys didn't coordinate with me.

464
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,200
Okay.

465
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:18,620
You can either go to college or career.

466
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:20,000
If you win, it's because you cheated.

467
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,580
You can't say that.

468
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:25,800
I'm not reading anything.

469
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:26,840
Wait, what is this?

470
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:30,120
You gotta choose your job, so there's space port operator.

471
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,900
You became a space operator?

472
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:33,680
Yeah, but you don't pay that much.

473
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,880
She joined the space force?

474
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:39,060
That's basically the space janitor.

475
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:41,420
I'm a blue collar worker.

476
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:42,280
Yeah.

477
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,900
What the frick?

478
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,660
What are we gonna do?

479
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:51,660
What is this?

480
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,340
Can someone explain the rules?

481
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:54,980
Slow down.

482
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,200
Slow down and explain.

483
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:58,620
What did happen so far?

484
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,660
You either get to get a job or go to college.

485
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,700
If you go to college, you go into debt.

486
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,380
More knowledge.

487
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:08,600
But you can have a chance to get a better job and earn more money.

488
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:13,160
But you have to pay off your college tuition afterwards.

489
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,180
I want a comic book.

490
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,040
Did you just pick up a comic book?

491
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,840
Yeah, so there's bonuses.

492
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:22,360
Types of bonuses you can get from the cards itself.

493
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,260
And stuff like that.

494
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:27,880
You can choose to buy one house.

495
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,100
Not houses, Bao.

496
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,060
One house.

497
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,360
And also...

498
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:37,260
Did you guys know that comic books are the clone of NFTs from the 90s?

499
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:37,980
What?

500
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,580
Yeah, you can sell them for higher.

501
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:40,620
Yeah, exactly.

502
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,940
They're like collectibles.

503
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:49,380
But like, NFTs are digital that you can now keep and own.

504
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,860
Okay, so it's legal.

505
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,620
That's what buying and selling is.

506
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,160
Okay, so hear me out.

507
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,320
We're gonna make a video game.

508
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,780
You and me and Doobie and Bao.

509
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:02,460
You guys are in, right?

510
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:06,640
We're going to put the blockchain in this junk, okay?

511
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:07,620
Wait.

512
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,960
This is why you don't say yes without hearing it out.

513
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,580
Now, listen, okay?

514
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,180
We are going to talk to Kazuna Ai and she's gonna be in.

515
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,200
Big business.

516
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:20,960
Big decisions.

517
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:21,580
What do you think?

518
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:26,900
Do you remember when I said Fillion is like the snake in Adam and Eve?

519
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:27,900
What does that mean?

520
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:29,480
No, no, no.

521
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:30,000
Okay, hold this.

522
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:31,440
No, hold this.

523
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:41,780
We'll make a really good video game and then we'll call it Elden Bling cause it's dressed to impress combined with I like that, yeah.

524
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:42,380
Thank you.

525
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:49,080
We can make VTuber Crypto Zoo where the eggs hatch Okay, yeah.

526
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:50,980
Calm down.

527
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:53,360
Okay, Bao, are you gonna go to college or?

528
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,960
I wanna be a starter Pokemon.

529
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:57,100
Where did that come from?

530
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:01,840
We're trying to decide college or career.

531
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,080
Hold on, hold on.

532
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:07,300
College, pay 100k to level up your education you get a better job.

533
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:08,560
Go to college.

534
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,220
Go to college, Bao.

535
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:14,000
I'm gonna go straight into my career.

536
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:14,500
Yeah!

537
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:19,580
You wanna be a caretaker or a moon miner?

538
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,600
That's a dream.

539
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,240
Nurse or...

540
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:26,180
Nurse or miner.

541
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,080
You can be Steve.

542
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:33,120
If you make moon miner into a sentence with moon as the verb it becomes very problematic.

543
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,740
You're so stupid.

544
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:37,600
Spin to move?

545
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:38,740
What does that mean?

546
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:40,920
What do you mean, what does that mean?

547
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,800
You played board games before!

548
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,840
Wait, she just ran out of money!

549
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:48,040
She ran out of Adobe!

550
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,120
She'll be okay.

551
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,740
She has insurance, right?

552
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,820
Get a rare comic book.

553
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:55,340
I don't think...

554
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:58,660
I mean, you get more bonuses if you upgrade your computer.

555
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:00,640
You can be a streamer if you upgrade your computer.

556
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,160
You can become a streamer!

557
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,860
Wait, but isn't she broke?

558
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:06,780
Yeah, I'm gonna be a streamer.

559
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,040
You paid $200,000 for a PC, Bao.

560
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:11,880
You just got scammed hard in the music video.

561
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,740
What if it has a 9080?

562
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,220
It could have a 9080!

563
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:17,960
Yeah!

564
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,720
What are you gonna compute with that?

565
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,740
I don't think Doobie needs that junk.

566
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:24,240
Bao's gonna go 3D.

567
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,980
No, she'll go 4D.

568
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,940
Has no one here gone to college yet?

569
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:32,880
No, it's not worth it.

570
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,640
In this economy?

571
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:38,860
You're saying, Fillian, you're the little snake in the garden.

572
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,500
You don't watch this.

573
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,780
Chat, go to college.

574
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:42,940
Get a job.

575
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:44,280
Become smart.

576
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:45,820
You know what I'm saying?

577
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,240
How does this work?

578
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:53,600
I just feel like we of all people cannot be credited.

579
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,300
Is this not working?

580
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,120
I'm literally spinning.

581
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:00,440
Let go.

582
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:01,460
Just spin harder.

583
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:06,080
This is why Fillian went to college, guys.

584
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:09,300
Bro, I've been spinning this.

585
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:11,140
Why doesn't this work?

586
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,880
This is why Fillian's going to college.

587
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:19,440
Bro, this is like when you open a bottle of pills and you can't figure it out.

588
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,400
How does this work?

589
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,320
I'm spinning it.

590
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:22,400
Just spin.

591
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,760
I'm gonna circle a bunch.

592
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:26,380
There!

593
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:29,980
You're spinning the wrong way.

594
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,420
Someone please help me.

595
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:32,480
Okay.

596
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,520
Someone please help me.

597
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,360
Someone please help me.

598
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,900
Someone grab the NPC.

599
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:41,680
Why was that so hard?

600
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,140
Oh, hey.

601
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:44,240
Hi.

602
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:45,580
I'm finished college.

603
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:46,820
You did it.

604
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:47,460
What the hell?

605
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:48,560
You spedrun it.

606
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,300
Oh my god.

607
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,320
Four years.

608
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:51,880
You did it.

609
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,800
Guys, guys, silence.

610
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,660
I'm becoming... Wait, what is this?

611
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:56,640
You have the most knowledge.

612
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:57,560
Thank you.

613
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:58,620
Every day I read a book.

614
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,240
Hold the crown till the game wins.

615
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:01,340
Okay.

616
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,880
Here goes my job, guys.

617
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:04,460
Look out.

618
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:05,020
Here it is.

619
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:09,900
Your girl Fillian is gonna grow up and become a rocket engineer.

620
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,020
Oh my god.

621
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:14,220
I'm like a whole explorer.

622
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,460
Oh, but you have to pay more taxes.

623
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:15,960
Oh, no.

624
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:16,700
You should take it.

625
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,220
You should do a rocket engineer.

626
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,740
Should I explore holes or rockets?

627
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:22,860
No, you should.

628
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:25,580
Should I explore holes or rockets?

629
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,000
Let me know in the comments section.

630
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:27,860
Alright.

631
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:29,740
Rocket?

632
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,460
Dude, the hole sounds crazier.

633
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,300
I'm not gonna lie.

634
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:33,060
Okay.

635
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,020
On the other hand...

636
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,640
Fillian, look at the taxes you pay.

637
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:40,980
Yeah, you subtract one right now.

638
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,760
Guys, I'm going to start drama.

639
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,240
I'm gonna start drama.

640
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:50,500
Doobie3D 3-dimensional commits tax evasion.

641
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,640
If she can do it, I can.

642
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,520
It just picked for me.

643
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,020
It just picked for me.

644
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,200
Good job.

645
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:59,680
It just picked for me.

646
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:02,080
I guess I'm a rocket engineer.

647
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,900
Fillian, spin the wheel.

648
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:05,040
You can spin again.

649
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:05,740
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

650
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:07,740
I don't know, bro.

651
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,580
How am I ending a combo on a frame one?

652
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,200
You did it.

653
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:13,460
Nice.

654
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,580
Action is coming.

655
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:18,540
Camp one of the stars or mow the neighbor's lawn.

656
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:23,040
I did not study to become a rocket engineer to mow lawns.

657
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:25,880
I'm thinking about the economy right now.

658
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:26,540
You get money.

659
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,040
You get 80k.

660
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:29,160
What do you mean?

661
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:31,840
I'm on the pursuit of happiness.

662
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,720
Oh my god.

663
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,100
Dude, the stars called me.

664
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:41,700
I can't believe you skipped out on 80k.

665
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:44,540
Bro, okay, then how about you go to college, idiot?

666
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:45,180
No, it's fine.

667
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:49,500
I played this game before, so I know how to win.

668
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:50,840
You know the meta.

669
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:53,560
I know the meta.

670
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,140
I'll be a travel agent.

671
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,260
What are these taxes on the moon, dude?

672
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,800
What are they, space travel agents?

673
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,860
I lose like 90% of my income.

674
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,160
Oh shit, who was nine?

675
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,760
Oh, Doobie got 50k.

676
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
God damn it.

677
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,140
God damn it.

678
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:10,740
I got robbed by a janitor.

679
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:12,520
What?

680
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:14,300
You just made a million bucks, Doobie.

681
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:16,800
That's fine.

682
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,500
Watch a game stream?

683
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,500
Check that out.

684
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,160
How crazy is that?

685
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:23,040
Gain some knowledge.

686
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,180
I'm gonna mow the neighbor's lawn.

687
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:27,260
Yeah, exactly.

688
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:30,040
I've already lost 50k to Doobie.

689
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,480
This is what you could've had.

690
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,820
This is what you could've had, 80k.

691
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:40,280
You literally set a bad example for the audience.

692
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:43,760
No, in this economy right now...

693
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,020
Oh my god.

694
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:49,460
Not gonna lie, but...

695
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:55,220
Right now, if you're an American right now, and you have college tuition, it's pretty fucking bad.

696
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,360
Get a raise or get a new job.

697
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,300
Oh, take the gamble.

698
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,860
You don't wanna be a janitor forever.

699
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,280
Let's go gambling.

700
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:08,020
I'm not a janitor.

701
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:11,440
Okay, you're a spaceport operator.

702
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:13,580
That's practically a space janitor.

703
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:14,620
Discord mod.

704
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:17,400
Oh true, you're a space mod.

705
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:18,440
Yeah.

706
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:20,680
Okay.

707
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:21,580
Let's see.

708
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:22,900
Oh frick, she's re-rolling?

709
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:26,560
No, I don't like these.

710
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,700
Wait, what was your last...

711
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:29,300
How much did you make in your last job?

712
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:29,760
What do you mean?

713
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,420
I'm literally a space travel agent.

714
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:33,100
What do you not like about that?

715
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:35,680
It's literally my job.

716
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,880
It's literally my job.

717
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:37,840
We're co-workers.

718
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,420
We'll defend a move.

719
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:44,200
I still don't understand how Fillion struggled spinning this.

720
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:47,620
Bro, I'm in virtual reality.

721
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,200
No, we're not.

722
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:51,400
We're virtual YouTubers.

723
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:54,900
Stay single, stay on your path, or get married.

724
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,380
Start your family to get love.

725
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,100
You don't need a family.

726
00:27:59,140 --> 00:27:59,940
Yeah, exactly.

727
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:02,560
Wait, so how do you win this game?

728
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:06,480
You win this game by having the most money.

729
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:07,500
What about happiness?

730
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:08,880
What about happiness and knowledge?

731
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,220
That doesn't make passive income, I don't care.

732
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:12,760
Yeah, that doesn't make...

733
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:16,820
Babysit?

734
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,320
If I want kids, I'll just babysit.

735
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,100
Exactly!

736
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,680
It's like renting a child.

737
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:23,180
Rent a child, and you get paid.

738
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:24,620
And I get paid, easy.

739
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:26,400
You stole a child?

740
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,060
No, it's renting a child.

741
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,120
It's illegal.

742
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:32,840
You can rent a dog in Japan.

743
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:35,120
I thought that was really cool.

744
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:36,120
You can rent a dog?

745
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,740
Yeah, you can rent dogs in Japan.

746
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,440
So you can rent them and...

747
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,900
People just let you borrow their dogs?

748
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:43,700
Yeah, and then borrow them to walk and stuff.

749
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:47,320
You can rent...

750
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,640
A girlfriend or something?

751
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:49,980
That's like an attraction.

752
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:51,860
I want to rent a girlfriend.

753
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,140
You got money to yourself?

754
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:56,160
Yeah, baby.

755
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:57,700
A job gives you a lucky number.

756
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:58,840
If you spend your own, you get 50k.

757
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,600
I let on my own lucky number.

758
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:01,560
You should get a job.

759
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,680
I just ran over someone.

760
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:05,720
Let's go gambling.

761
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:07,660
Let's go gambling.

762
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,260
Raise to increase your salary or get a new job.

763
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,000
Okay, so wait, hear me out guys.

764
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:17,680
So if I take this new job thing, Does that put me into a proper job?

765
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:19,800
Or does it put me into a high educated job?

766
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:20,640
Let's go gambling.

767
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:23,080
You know what?

768
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,980
My mom told me to be a rocket scientist.

769
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:26,900
I'm going to stick with it.

770
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,500
So, unlike you guys, I'm going to climb the corporate ladder.

771
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:33,060
I'll see you guys from the top of my bank account.

772
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:33,640
It's going to take 20 years.

773
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,560
It's going to take 20 years until you get what you want then.

774
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,260
I'll see you from the top of my bank account.

775
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:37,900
It doesn't matter.

776
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,080
Alright, spin.

777
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:42,640
I have half a mil already.

778
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,720
What the frick?

779
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:44,520
What do you mean?

780
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:48,380
I didn't go get a job.

781
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:49,320
I went to get a job.

782
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,800
How did you do it?

783
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:53,980
It's so stupid.

784
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,840
She's literally living off of me right now.

785
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,400
She's my landlord.

786
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:04,140
Okay, who's this?

787
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:04,880
Is this me?

788
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:05,800
Oh, I get it back.

789
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:06,400
It's fine.

790
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,280
Oh, she was just borrowing it.

791
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:09,560
Yeah.

792
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,740
Oh, the bank is giving me bonus?

793
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,340
I mean...

794
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:17,460
Guys, do your taxes and then you'll get your government check.

795
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:21,580
Do your taxes.

796
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:24,200
Chat, am I an idiot?

797
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,840
You can't ask your chat that.

798
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,520
You can't ask your chat that.

799
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:30,160
Doobie, am I an idiot?

800
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:36,080
She's not going to...

801
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,480
She's going to be nice to you, Filly.

802
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:42,380
Wait, everyone silence Doobie.

803
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:43,060
You're smart.

804
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:45,340
Oh, that's manipulation right there.

805
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:47,680
Why are you manipulating me?

806
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,740
A friend doesn't manipulate.

807
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:54,440
Doobie, doobie, do you guys know I took an IQ test and got 125?

808
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,620
Okay, that's a lie.

809
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:59,020
That has to be one of those free IQ tests.

810
00:30:59,020 --> 00:30:59,680
I don't think those are real.

811
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:02,420
Yeah, I heard a lot of IQ tests are scams.

812
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:04,440
Doobie, what do you want to do?

813
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:05,700
Okay, that was really quick.

814
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,500
If you want to pursue...

815
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,520
Oh, thank you.

816
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:16,820
She was just borrowing 50k from me.

817
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:19,540
Oh, she got 102.

818
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:22,440
Okay, Doobie.

819
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:23,660
Yeah.

820
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:24,640
Am I smart?

821
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,780
I don't know you well enough.

822
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,040
That's crazy.

823
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:34,820
Good answer.

824
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:35,720
Good answer.

825
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:38,720
That was really generous of you.

826
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,420
I'll be taking that.

827
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,600
You know what, Doobie?

828
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:49,840
What's up?

829
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:51,420
Oh, you could get married here.

830
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,800
But it's top speed is still better than your internet.

831
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:56,920
That's fucked.

832
00:31:58,740 --> 00:31:59,780
That's fucked.

833
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,380
Oh, you can get a house.

834
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,540
Wait, you can buy a house?

835
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,020
Yeah.

836
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,840
I literally explained the rules.

837
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:14,080
You can sell it for 500k.

838
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,900
Think about the sellback.

839
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,900
What a satellite.

840
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:19,800
What the frick?

841
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:22,700
She's gonna get 8G internet.

842
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:24,860
With extra fiber.

843
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:26,300
Oh, it's my turn.

844
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:27,640
Oh, I eat fiber every morning.

845
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:28,560
Solar powered.

846
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:30,780
Oh my god.

847
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:32,340
Thanks for the money.

848
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:36,300
Thanks for the 50k.

849
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,080
You're still there?

850
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,200
I'm getting some back.

851
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,660
Now listen, guys.

852
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:45,040
You should upgrade your computer for your stream.

853
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:47,760
I don't need to upgrade my PC for my stream.

854
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,480
Because I'm too busy watching streams.

855
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:52,940
There it is.

856
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:53,800
There it is.

857
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,640
She's retired to be a chat Andy.

858
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:57,300
Yeah.

859
00:32:58,520 --> 00:32:59,860
Oh, it's my turn.

860
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,120
I'm one of you guys now, boys.

861
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:03,380
Oh, fuck, who's that?

862
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,680
Oh, okay, it's fine.

863
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:06,880
I have so much money.

864
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:08,740
It's like nothing to me at this point.

865
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,560
I'm just here to help.

866
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,400
Oh, no, I might get taxed.

867
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:15,100
Oh, fuck, okay.

868
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:18,540
If you land on the red, you get taxed.

869
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:21,340
But I'm a good person and I do pay my taxes.

870
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:24,400
And, you know, we gotta support the...

871
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,300
Oh, thank God, okay.

872
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,420
Let's go.

873
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:34,200
Oh, I get a space scraper apartment.

874
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,780
You get an apartment in space?

875
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,660
I get an apartment?

876
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,320
At the top floor?

877
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,660
I get the suite.

878
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:45,240
Does anyone know how this game works?

879
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,900
Right now, I feel like I'm losing.

880
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:49,780
You just have to play it as if you're living life.

881
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:52,040
Okay, but then what's the point of having more knowledge?

882
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,140
Why am I behind everyone?

883
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:55,020
Because that's life.

884
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,520
Didn't you say you want to pursue...

885
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,340
You want to be fulfilled?

886
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:00,760
That's basically...

887
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:03,380
You're getting fulfilled right now.

888
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:06,360
You guys are only in it for the corpo.

889
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,640
I'm in it for the fun of it.

890
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,900
See, like, 100,000 bucks for VR.

891
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:14,240
Visit a VR museum?

892
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,420
Oh, but look at the knowledge.

893
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:16,420
You might get more knowledge.

894
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:18,380
Yeah, but what am I going to do with knowledge?

895
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:18,980
Oh my gosh.

896
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:22,020
Do a VR every day.

897
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,140
VR museum?

898
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:25,200
Oh my gosh.

899
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:26,760
I want to save my money.

900
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:31,040
She's going to be a content creator on the side.

901
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:34,160
You already spent a small car on your setup.

902
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:34,840
Come on.

903
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:36,520
Get the job done.

904
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,000
All right, Bao.

905
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:40,060
What's it going to be?

906
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:42,300
Don't know.

907
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:43,700
Bonus?

908
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:44,840
Bonus to fill in.

909
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,140
Did you just run over me?

910
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:53,500
I might have.

911
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:58,100
Oh my god.

912
00:34:58,340 --> 00:34:58,820
Esports.

913
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:02,060
I'm a god gamer.

914
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,780
Oh, all players have to roll.

915
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:07,620
And then the one with the highest roll wins the esports event.

916
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,700
So you rolled a three.

917
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:11,660
Check this out.

918
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:13,700
This is the Among Us Nationals.

919
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:16,520
Whoever wins is the sussiest.

920
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,480
Oh my god.

921
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:25,780
Right off the bat.

922
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,940
Check out my apex movement.

923
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:31,220
That was so close.

924
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,560
Only one winner though.

925
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:40,220
Why can't I participate in my own sports event?

926
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:41,820
I have no money.

927
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:42,820
You did.

928
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:44,900
You just got last place, Bao.

929
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:48,140
Wait, did I get 200 bucks?

930
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:49,240
Yeah, you get 200k.

931
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:52,420
Oh my god, I'm a rocket engineer with half a million in the bank chat.

932
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:53,860
I'm telling you, it all comes back.

933
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:54,700
It all comes together.

934
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:57,400
You haven't paid off your college tuition yet.

935
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:02,000
You haven't paid it off yet.

936
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,520
You haven't had to shut up yet.

937
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,460
Let me give you a life hack.

938
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:15,300
If you press spacebar, you roll the thing.

939
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,040
I am in New York!

940
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:19,340
If you press spacebar...

941
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:20,240
I still need to get married.

942
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:21,640
Wait, she's still there?

943
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,200
I still need to get married.

944
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,500
Wait, you should get married.

945
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:25,860
Then you'll be more fulfilled.

946
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:29,180
Is there somebody you can get a partnership with?

947
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:30,820
Someone build a tower defense unit.

948
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:34,780
Um...

949
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:35,620
Frick, I'm gonna get married.

950
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,460
Chat, listen!

951
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,320
I'm fulfilling my wife-long dream.

952
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,480
Your wife-long dream?

953
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:44,520
I'm marrying my left hand.

954
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:45,640
Okay.

955
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,400
I put a dress on her.

956
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,240
Okay, here we go.

957
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:52,820
Everyone, type one in the chat to pour one out for whoever she married.

958
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:54,200
Whoever's the unlucky guy.

959
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:57,600
Wait, I didn't even know what this laser tag battle art was.

960
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,340
Oh, it's like an eSport event again.

961
00:36:59,460 --> 00:36:59,720
Oh my god.

962
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:02,560
Do you guys wanna see me win big money in the arena against these nerds?

963
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,600
They don't know what's wrong.

964
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,520
Legacy is my actual legacy.

965
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:09,280
You could've gotten the other one where, you know, none of us get money.

966
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,060
But that's okay.

967
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:12,400
This is the fattest tent in history.

968
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:14,920
The one on the left would've guaranteed second place.

969
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:15,260
Yeah.

970
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:17,800
I'm higher than you guys, so it doesn't matter.

971
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:18,880
Oh.

972
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:20,380
She just loves to gamble.

973
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:21,120
I'm going for space.

974
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:21,580
Frick this.

975
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:25,900
See?

976
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:28,160
You gave up so fast.

977
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,540
Oh my god.

978
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:31,340
I got two.

979
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:32,600
Are you fucking serious?

980
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,200
I'm just so bad at laser tag.

981
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,880
Sorry, I wasn't wearing glasses.

982
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,580
So, like, I just felt bad.

983
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,160
It's alright.

984
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,260
Free 10k.

985
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:45,400
Can everyone just sit down for a second?

986
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:46,540
Come on, guys.

987
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,800
I'm the gaming god champion.

988
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,100
Okay, rocket engineer.

989
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:54,660
Okay, rocket engineer who went to college.

990
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:56,040
Call me rocket Balboa.

991
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,680
Because I took you guys all out.

992
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,200
Let's go.

993
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,920
Space bar.

994
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,260
Oh shit, who is this?

995
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,280
God damn it.

996
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:08,400
Oh my god, am I winning?

997
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,380
Am I winning?

998
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:13,940
Alright, accident.

999
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:15,340
Let's see.

1000
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:19,060
I can get a better job.

1001
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:19,840
But I don't want to.

1002
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,020
You know what?

1003
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:23,120
I don't need to fix my life.

1004
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,420
I'm going to go to a concert.

1005
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:32,100
You guys know, next month Doobie, Min, and I are going to have a concert.

1006
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:37,600
You know what?

1007
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,220
It's a great time to chill.

1008
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,420
I hate my life.

1009
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:42,660
I hate you all.

1010
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,580
This is cringe.

1011
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,060
Alright, who's next?

1012
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:49,380
Next round.

1013
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,460
You're getting married, Fillion.

1014
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:52,640
What are you talking about?

1015
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,860
You get to pick.

1016
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,960
I mean, you have almost a million dollars.

1017
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:11,660
It's nothing to you.

1018
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:12,900
Yeah, I guess.

1019
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:14,920
Alright, bow.

1020
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,360
Oh, you're going to stop anyway.

1021
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:23,100
You're going to have a house or a kid.

1022
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,080
I'm going to invest.

1023
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,000
This is going so fast.

1024
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:30,360
I told you, this game is super fast.

1025
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:35,120
You want to slow down in life?

1026
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,440
Why not enjoy life?

1027
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:39,100
I literally don't even know what's happening right now.

1028
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:39,980
I'm getting married tomorrow.

1029
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:42,840
What are you going to get?

1030
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:45,720
I'm going to sell my underwear.

1031
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:46,920
Oh.

1032
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,260
Guys, guys, guys.

1033
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,800
You got 80k for that.

1034
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:52,460
Yes!

1035
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,620
We're so back!

1036
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,480
She got $80,000.

1037
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,770
And it's tax deductible.

1038
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,540
Oh, that's true.

1039
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,000
It is.

1040
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:13,100
Before you make your decision, you got to explain it so that the game can slow down a little bit.

1041
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:14,360
So that we can understand what's happening.

1042
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:16,600
How much left?

1043
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:17,580
I don't know.

1044
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:22,700
Guys, everyone silence.

1045
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:28,340
I'm going to marry either Michael Jackson or this blue tuxedo guy.

1046
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:29,420
I'm going to pick this thing.

1047
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,340
I'm straight.

1048
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:33,340
I married a man.

1049
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:35,080
There it is.

1050
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:37,370
Boom, boom, ba-dum.

1051
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,560
Boom, boom, ba-dum.

1052
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:42,020
Oh my god.

1053
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:44,240
He's just sitting there behind you.

1054
00:40:46,850 --> 00:40:47,880
Only 20k?

1055
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:53,520
You can tell when she's not pressing spacebar.

1056
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:56,280
Wait, oh my god.

1057
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:57,380
You're so kind.

1058
00:40:58,810 --> 00:40:59,960
What a freak.

1059
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:01,280
Oh my god.

1060
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:04,980
We gotta pay 20k for her...

1061
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:06,500
I didn't even want to go to her wedding.

1062
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:08,020
We didn't even get invited.

1063
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:11,280
I would've tweeted long if you didn't show up.

1064
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:12,800
Oh, do it.

1065
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,820
There's like a 20k invoice in your PayPal.

1066
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,840
Guys, everyone silence.

1067
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:18,960
I just became a millionaire.

1068
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,160
Oh my god.

1069
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:23,320
Oh, and she gets a child.

1070
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:24,580
That's fast.

1071
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:26,140
Oh, you can get a pig.

1072
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:27,820
Oh my god.

1073
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:30,540
Get the kids.

1074
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:31,960
They can work for you.

1075
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:32,860
That's true.

1076
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:35,180
Children can work for you.

1077
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:36,400
You can invest in your kids.

1078
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:43,160
You can be like those family YouTubers that are illegal now.

1079
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:50,080
By the way, you should not do that.

1080
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,420
Do the funny TikTok.

1081
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:53,860
Come on, little fillian.

1082
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:54,960
You gotta dance now.

1083
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:59,880
But mom, I already recorded 20 TikToks today.

1084
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:03,160
Wait, how am I fitting two kids and a husband on a car?

1085
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:05,620
You got a family car.

1086
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:07,920
I was like, how do I fit this dorm on a motorcycle?

1087
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:09,980
Alright, spin, spin.

1088
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:11,340
Oh, true.

1089
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:13,040
You mocap a child.

1090
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,400
That sounds so human.

1091
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:17,860
Human rights.

1092
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:20,880
That's definitely not a human rights issue right there.

1093
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:23,700
I'm mocapping a child.

1094
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:27,200
I just keep paying Doobie.

1095
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:28,840
She's literally my landlord.

1096
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:33,060
Oh, thank god.

1097
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:34,700
I got at least some of it back.

1098
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:37,820
20k and you'll add face tracking to the baby.

1099
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:39,360
Everybody pause!

1100
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:42,040
Wait, how do you evaluate?

1101
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:43,380
How do you stare at the whole map?

1102
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:44,820
I don't know.

1103
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:47,480
Press M?

1104
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,400
Maybe it's M?

1105
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:49,940
Is it M?

1106
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:52,940
I don't think it shows.

1107
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:54,420
Maybe you can only do it on your own turn.

1108
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:55,440
Yeah, maybe.

1109
00:42:57,420 --> 00:43:02,740
Okay, so you know how you have the little baby crib toys that hangs on top of the crib?

1110
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:07,480
You can replace that with an iPhone so that it tracks the baby's face.

1111
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:12,780
That way you can have full body and face tracking for the baby.

1112
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:13,920
Oh!

1113
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:16,040
Doobie wants to get a pet.

1114
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:17,320
No duh.

1115
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:20,100
Second chance to get married.

1116
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:21,800
They're really pushing that.

1117
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:23,320
Doobie, Doobie, Doobie, get married!

1118
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:26,920
We can marry each other.

1119
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:27,360
Wait, what?

1120
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:31,040
I'll drop my current husband and my kids and put them up for adoption.

1121
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,480
She would leave?

1122
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,160
She would leave your husband?

1123
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:36,840
We're both blue.

1124
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:38,800
I signed a prenup, come on.

1125
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:40,220
Oh my.

1126
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,880
I just got into a yaoi marriage.

1127
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:44,740
Wait, are you gay?

1128
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:47,180
I guess so.

1129
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:49,340
Oh my god.

1130
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:51,680
Why did we have to pay $1,020,000,000?

1131
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:54,200
No, because she got the black space.

1132
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:56,160
We got the red space.

1133
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:57,020
I see.

1134
00:43:57,940 --> 00:44:00,240
Wait, so we're just texting people now because we're married?

1135
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:05,380
Yeah, no, it's because you know in a wedding you're supposed to give like gifts and stuff so this is the gift.

1136
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:08,360
Even though we weren't invited technically.

1137
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:10,600
Okay, explain it to me.

1138
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:12,540
It's when you eat hot dogs.

1139
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:14,800
Oh, like Glizzy?

1140
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:16,760
Yeah, the Glizzy goblin.

1141
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:18,000
The guzzler?

1142
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:20,520
Have you heard of docking before?

1143
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:22,840
Shut up!

1144
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:24,340
It's from Interstellar.

1145
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:25,040
Oh, okay.

1146
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:28,240
I'm gonna go take a sushi class.

1147
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:31,040
Oh, she can make sushi!

1148
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:32,640
You can use your own tail!

1149
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,000
Because it regenerates, right?

1150
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:38,340
You literally cut your tail if you're hungry and then it'll regenerate.

1151
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:39,440
Can you guys see the world map?

1152
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:41,640
You have to wait until the market's good.

1153
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:42,980
Can you guys see the world map?

1154
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:44,300
Yeah, we can.

1155
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:48,560
So I'm in last place in terms of movement, but I have a million bucks.

1156
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:49,720
Oh, she's over there.

1157
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:51,620
We're literally at the end.

1158
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:55,080
Wait, how am I so slow?

1159
00:44:55,620 --> 00:45:00,580
Guys, I took the scenic route, I got married, I had kids, I'm just smelling the roses.

1160
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:01,260
No signal?

1161
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:04,680
She's just enjoying life, you know?

1162
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:06,180
Wait, my effing stream broke, apparently.

1163
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:10,620
Guys, if Fillion's stream broke, there's two other people also streaming.

1164
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:13,220
And you wanna check us out.

1165
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:15,640
No, no, no!

1166
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:21,820
You know, Bao and me, Doki Bird, we're both also streaming too.

1167
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:25,460
Thank God.

1168
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:27,520
Oh my God, I shot a whole bunch of stars.

1169
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:28,280
That's what you do when you're sick.

1170
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:31,300
Am I rich?

1171
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:32,880
You have an action.

1172
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:36,640
You can volunteer for charity, or babysit.

1173
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:39,880
Charity is a great thing.

1174
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:41,880
Let's get more kids in my life.

1175
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:44,500
You'll be more fulfilled.

1176
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:47,060
I'm so filled up.

1177
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:50,580
You know she's really rich if she's not even going for the money option anymore.

1178
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:56,840
Are you afraid, Doki, that I'm giving up the mortal desires of money and income for happiness?

1179
00:45:56,840 --> 00:46:00,600
I'm not afraid, I'm just like, well, it's your choice, you know?

1180
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:03,700
Alright, off to the next square.

1181
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:07,120
Online course or continue life.

1182
00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:09,500
Oh, I invested in property.

1183
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:10,380
Do you have a house?

1184
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:11,720
Do I have a house?

1185
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:12,060
Yeah.

1186
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:13,140
No you don't.

1187
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:16,100
I live by my car.

1188
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:17,400
I love my car.

1189
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:19,620
Here's your doobie tax.

1190
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:22,640
Here's your fucking doobie tax again.

1191
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:24,440
Oh, a hundred K.

1192
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:26,300
Thank God I paid my taxes.

1193
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:26,680
See?

1194
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:29,740
If I pay my doobie tax, I get a hundred K back.

1195
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:34,140
How do you guys keep getting free money?

1196
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:35,740
Do you pay your taxes?

1197
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:41,260
Um...

1198
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:42,880
Wait, guys, how do I buy a house?

1199
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:44,360
I don't think that's any of your business.

1200
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:46,320
Val, can you sell me your house?

1201
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:50,820
Can you sell things to people?

1202
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:51,800
No, you can't.

1203
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:55,680
Oh, you can watch a documentary about dinosaurs.

1204
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:00,340
You should spend money to make money.

1205
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:03,280
Yeah, but what am I gonna do with sushi skill?

1206
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,700
I can't even become a chef or anything.

1207
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:05,660
I don't know.

1208
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:08,140
I chose it just to see what would happen and nothing happened.

1209
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:14,940
Well, in the end, all the stats you get from like the stuff gets converted into money in the end.

1210
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:15,420
Wow!

1211
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:17,120
Stats equals money?

1212
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:17,660
Yeah.

1213
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:18,400
Yes.

1214
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,420
I hate college.

1215
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:23,680
Wait, so you're telling me my happiness is just income?

1216
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:24,660
Yeah.

1217
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:26,560
I need to turn my life around.

1218
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:27,860
This is going poorly.

1219
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:31,760
Wait, what are you gonna get?

1220
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:33,660
Oh, okay.

1221
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:35,740
NK.

1222
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:37,680
You can be the engineer.

1223
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:40,400
You can be Fillion's co-worker.

1224
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:41,580
Yeah, let's be co-workers.

1225
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:43,020
Let's go.

1226
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:50,140
Would you trust Would you trust Fillion and Bao to fix your spaceship?

1227
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:52,480
That's like a better question.

1228
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:55,300
Wait, who did you land on?

1229
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:56,380
What space did you land on?

1230
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:57,300
A star.

1231
00:47:58,240 --> 00:47:59,220
Okay, but like what number?

1232
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:01,320
Oh, three.

1233
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:02,500
Oh, that's me!

1234
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:03,880
That's me!

1235
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:06,820
Oh, dance off.

1236
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:09,040
Oh, she got eight.

1237
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:11,200
If I lose this, God is dead.

1238
00:48:11,340 --> 00:48:12,340
If I lose this, God is dead.

1239
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:13,580
Wait, check this out.

1240
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:14,060
Here we go.

1241
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:14,920
I'm gonna do the yapping.

1242
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:17,160
God, please.

1243
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:18,880
Give me anything.

1244
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:22,040
Oh, she lost it.

1245
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:24,200
She already lost it.

1246
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:25,220
She already lost it.

1247
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:25,580
GG.

1248
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:26,280
GG.

1249
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:27,400
This is already over.

1250
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:29,420
No, are you serious?

1251
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,440
I'm fucking always last.

1252
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:34,620
I took dad's last.

1253
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:35,440
Yeah, okay.

1254
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:37,260
You're so good at shooters.

1255
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:39,320
It's alright.

1256
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:39,920
It's alright.

1257
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:40,480
Third.

1258
00:48:41,660 --> 00:48:43,260
Third place, that's fine.

1259
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:47,940
Please, my dad's lessons has to pay off.

1260
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:48,400
Please.

1261
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:51,460
Doobie, you're so close to one mil.

1262
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:55,780
You're so close too.

1263
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:56,720
So far away.

1264
00:48:57,540 --> 00:48:59,380
I saw you at 90k last turn.

1265
00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:01,220
Most of my money is liquidated.

1266
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:02,580
You know, it's like in...

1267
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:04,200
Oh, it's in real estate.

1268
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:06,680
It's just not paper.

1269
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:08,440
I have all my money.

1270
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:10,140
At the end of the game, do we sell property?

1271
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:10,960
Yeah, we do.

1272
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:12,280
We sell all our property.

1273
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,480
And like, see how much...

1274
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:16,580
It's basically whoever has the most money in total.

1275
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:20,180
Fillian, just press space bar.

1276
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:20,980
Fillian, please.

1277
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:25,560
You're cheating.

1278
00:49:27,580 --> 00:49:28,980
It doesn't matter.

1279
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:31,840
Can I have more kids?

1280
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:33,880
Investment or family?

1281
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:35,540
Chat, I'm gonna be a Mormon.

1282
00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:37,460
We're just gonna have 17 kids and no property.

1283
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:41,220
Even a Mormon has a house.

1284
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:48,400
She's literally living in her car right now.

1285
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:49,420
Yeah, I know.

1286
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:50,760
Me and like 16 children.

1287
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:51,780
It's very rare.

1288
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:57,280
Wait, I get to steal money?

1289
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:58,940
Wait, but car race.

1290
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:05,360
You are so beautiful.

1291
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:08,220
And I just think that whoever married you...

1292
00:50:08,220 --> 00:50:09,440
Made the best decision of their life.

1293
00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:12,040
And your children have your eyes.

1294
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:15,800
You are a person.

1295
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:20,560
You're the smartest streamer that I know.

1296
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:22,260
Sellouts!

1297
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:23,800
You're all sellouts!

1298
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:25,860
You're all sellouts!

1299
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:27,620
That's what happened to integrity!

1300
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:32,380
Yeah, I know.

1301
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:34,420
You're talking a lot of smack for a piece of candy.

1302
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:37,920
You're a sellout!

1303
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:41,160
What do I gotta roll?

1304
00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:43,420
Spin the highest number?

1305
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:45,340
Yeah, spin the highest number.

1306
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:48,580
I've been very unlucky with this one.

1307
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:52,120
God fucking dammit!

1308
00:50:55,860 --> 00:50:56,900
You're number one!

1309
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:01,040
You're number one!

1310
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:03,100
But I have integrity!

1311
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:11,020
It's investment integrity.

1312
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:14,040
It's okay, I paid my taxes.

1313
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:16,260
I got my money back.

1314
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:18,560
That's her copium statement.

1315
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:20,500
At least I paid my taxes.

1316
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:25,060
Doki, this is just revenge for Monopoly.

1317
00:51:26,580 --> 00:51:28,620
It would be funny if after all of that...

1318
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:29,840
You still don't win this game.

1319
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:31,160
That's all that matters to me.

1320
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:33,600
You just want to see me lose.

1321
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:35,960
I just want to see you not be first in this round.

1322
00:51:35,980 --> 00:51:37,040
You're just a full time hater.

1323
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:40,860
Save the person that chose me!

1324
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:44,600
I asked for a comment and you called me a person.

1325
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:46,620
I'm like borderline non-binary.

1326
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:47,600
You're not?

1327
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:48,900
You're not a person?

1328
00:51:49,180 --> 00:51:50,820
I'm saying that you're a human being.

1329
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:54,740
But Doobie said I was smart and Val said my children are cute.

1330
00:51:55,660 --> 00:51:56,700
Yeah, but do they mean it?

1331
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:58,120
Yeah, of course.

1332
00:51:58,280 --> 00:51:59,520
At least I meant my statement.

1333
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:04,280
I know Val didn't mean her statement.

1334
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:10,620
So you'd rather surround yourself with like, yes men who would lie to you.

1335
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:13,480
Actually, if they're women, first off, that was racist.

1336
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:15,880
Second off, they can say whatever they want.

1337
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:16,460
It's America.

1338
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:20,340
We're literally on the moon, Fillion.

1339
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:25,300
This is the United States of the Moon.

1340
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:29,120
Wait,

1341
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,160
I'm not even American.

1342
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:35,180
Wait, you're right.

1343
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:37,380
I'm not even a fucking Canadian.

1344
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:39,260
You're Canadian?

1345
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:43,540
I've told you this at least five times.

1346
00:52:45,860 --> 00:52:49,240
Ice cap because Timmy's fucking sucks now.

1347
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:54,600
Timbit's quality went down a lot.

1348
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,260
Yeah, it did.

1349
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:57,980
I don't get Timbits anymore.

1350
00:52:59,060 --> 00:53:01,020
Timbits are not as good anymore.

1351
00:53:01,460 --> 00:53:03,360
How to tie my shoe.

1352
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:05,620
One, two...

1353
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:07,400
Oh god, I almost had two million bucks.

1354
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:08,200
My shoe.

1355
00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:09,980
Here we go, I'm spinning.

1356
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:10,520
Big number.

1357
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:11,420
Please.

1358
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:12,300
Big number?

1359
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:14,360
Please get her addicted to gambling.

1360
00:53:14,780 --> 00:53:17,160
Please, make her gamble more.

1361
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:19,780
Install a solar panel?

1362
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:20,740
You should do it.

1363
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:25,020
As an engineer, you should install a solar panel or you don't believe in what you do.

1364
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:26,800
Doki-do?

1365
00:53:27,260 --> 00:53:29,100
I think you're trying to lead me astray.

1366
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:32,020
No, you literally get more fucking stats.

1367
00:53:32,140 --> 00:53:34,480
I'm literally telling you, giving you good advice.

1368
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:36,000
Make a scrapbook and put it on my wall.

1369
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,380
You don't have any piggy banks.

1370
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:40,640
Can you decorate my picture?

1371
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:46,940
I'm going to make a scrapbook and put it on my wall with all of your faces.

1372
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:49,240
That's when you know she's rich rich.

1373
00:53:49,540 --> 00:53:51,060
She has time to scrapbook.

1374
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:54,680
Yeah, I do arts and crafts on TikTok.

1375
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:55,460
That's how rich I am.

1376
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:58,360
Are you fucking...

1377
00:53:58,360 --> 00:53:59,340
Oh my god.

1378
00:54:00,140 --> 00:54:01,040
This is hell.

1379
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:03,220
At least I get 10.

1380
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:05,160
Oh, I just need two steps anyway.

1381
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:06,240
It doesn't matter.

1382
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:09,680
Risky or safe?

1383
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:10,860
You know what?

1384
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:13,780
This is the only way.

1385
00:54:14,620 --> 00:54:16,040
It's gamba time.

1386
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,420
It's gamba time.

1387
00:54:19,220 --> 00:54:21,500
It means you can get taxed.

1388
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:22,500
Alright, here we go.

1389
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:23,520
I got taxed.

1390
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:25,520
I got taxed.

1391
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:36,640
God, I love gambling.

1392
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:38,720
Let's go gambling.

1393
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:40,520
Let's go gambling.

1394
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:41,340
Oh man.

1395
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:45,920
Does anyone ever call you dooby doo?

1396
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:47,840
No.

1397
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:50,900
Where are you?

1398
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:52,600
And then she'll get copyright striked.

1399
00:54:52,660 --> 00:54:54,400
I need you to call me.

1400
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:55,120
Come on, go risky.

1401
00:54:58,860 --> 00:54:59,920
Let's go gambling.

1402
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:02,800
Oh, why can't I get that?

1403
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:04,200
That's not bad, okay.

1404
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:05,700
I didn't get taxed.

1405
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:06,420
Not yet.

1406
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:10,900
Let's go, let's go.

1407
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:14,640
Why can't I get that?

1408
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:15,640
That's like action.

1409
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:16,560
It's an action card.

1410
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:17,460
Oh.

1411
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:22,700
Yeah, you get to do family movie night or complete a... that's a fucking expensive...

1412
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:27,020
It's a very expensive puzzle.

1413
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:30,440
It was designed by Van Gogh before he died.

1414
00:55:32,060 --> 00:55:33,360
I'm gonna do this one.

1415
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:39,780
King of knowledge.

1416
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:41,780
Okay, primordial soup.

1417
00:55:42,220 --> 00:55:43,060
That's me, man.

1418
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:44,900
I don't know.

1419
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:47,800
She's definitely...

1420
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:49,140
Oh, she's wearing weird.

1421
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:49,620
Go risky.

1422
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:51,500
You're at risk versus safe.

1423
00:55:51,740 --> 00:55:52,640
You should do it.

1424
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:54,500
It'll be so funny.

1425
00:55:55,340 --> 00:55:56,080
She's going risky.

1426
00:55:56,780 --> 00:55:57,340
Go!

1427
00:55:58,900 --> 00:55:59,820
What happened?

1428
00:56:00,140 --> 00:56:00,740
You got seven.

1429
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:03,820
Three, four, five, six.

1430
00:56:05,540 --> 00:56:07,340
Yo, she nailed that junk.

1431
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:10,720
And now I'm gonna get a hundred thousand dollars.

1432
00:56:11,180 --> 00:56:12,320
Oh, you get another house.

1433
00:56:13,220 --> 00:56:15,800
You can pick to...

1434
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:17,940
You have another house.

1435
00:56:17,980 --> 00:56:19,400
You can afford it.

1436
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:21,020
I can afford it.

1437
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:23,280
Oh my gosh, she got the penthouse.

1438
00:56:23,660 --> 00:56:24,660
That's right, baby.

1439
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:28,100
Why would I live out of a car with a family of four?

1440
00:56:28,180 --> 00:56:29,860
Wait, Bile actually might win this.

1441
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:32,640
She has two properties.

1442
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:35,060
That was my strat from the beginning.

1443
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:36,220
Buy all the houses.

1444
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:38,900
She actually might win this.

1445
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:43,460
Guys, why am I held back in the third grade for three years straight?

1446
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:44,960
And you guys are all graduating.

1447
00:56:45,140 --> 00:56:48,340
You're the ones that wanted children and a family.

1448
00:56:49,140 --> 00:56:51,460
If I don't make it to the end in time, what happens?

1449
00:56:51,820 --> 00:56:53,080
We wait for you.

1450
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:55,580
We literally just wait for you until you make it to the end.

1451
00:56:57,100 --> 00:56:58,760
We just watch you play.

1452
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:00,240
Alright, bet.

1453
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:01,380
Watch me play by myself.

1454
00:57:01,540 --> 00:57:02,220
I'll do a let's play.

1455
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:05,780
Oh my god, back to the let's play era.

1456
00:57:07,620 --> 00:57:09,260
Seven, that's a big number, I think.

1457
00:57:09,580 --> 00:57:10,660
Yeah, you get to go...

1458
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:13,040
I can't believe you never got extra kids after that.

1459
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:17,260
You didn't even get to the next zone.

1460
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:21,880
Listen to an audiobook or install a solar panel.

1461
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:24,040
They really want you to have solar panels.

1462
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:26,020
I think they're trying to tell you something.

1463
00:57:26,540 --> 00:57:27,740
I'm just gonna chat.

1464
00:57:27,860 --> 00:57:28,500
What should I do?

1465
00:57:28,620 --> 00:57:30,220
One audiobook, two panels.

1466
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:34,700
Legitimately, I like audiobooks way more than solar panels.

1467
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:37,420
If I'm gonna be honest, renewable energy don't matter to me.

1468
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:38,820
I think I'm gonna be dead in like 50 years.

1469
00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:40,180
Here we go.

1470
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:41,580
Here we go.

1471
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:43,400
Okay.

1472
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:47,480
That's the message she's sending out to her chat.

1473
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:48,360
Okay.

1474
00:57:50,220 --> 00:57:50,740
Alright.

1475
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:53,400
Alright, I bet you I can get...

1476
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:54,540
I'm gonna get taxed again.

1477
00:57:54,660 --> 00:57:56,720
I bet you I'm gonna get... Oh, nice.

1478
00:57:56,860 --> 00:57:57,400
Thank god.

1479
00:57:57,900 --> 00:58:01,680
I got my taxes back.

1480
00:58:05,820 --> 00:58:06,340
Alright.

1481
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:06,420
Alright.

1482
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:08,260
Who's turn next?

1483
00:58:09,580 --> 00:58:10,640
Oh, it's Doobie.

1484
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:12,060
Let's go.

1485
00:58:13,540 --> 00:58:15,700
So Doobie, can you tell me some cool black hole facts?

1486
00:58:16,940 --> 00:58:18,100
Wait, but she's not a black hole.

1487
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:18,940
Oh, she is.

1488
00:58:19,220 --> 00:58:20,480
She is a black hole expert.

1489
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:21,600
Oh yeah, you are.

1490
00:58:22,180 --> 00:58:23,600
So here's the thing.

1491
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:25,580
Do you think we can ever escape a black hole?

1492
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:27,360
Or do you think Hawking's radiation is real?

1493
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:30,220
I don't think you can escape a black hole.

1494
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:31,600
We're probably already in one.

1495
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:33,180
We're in a black hole?

1496
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:34,840
That's true, it could be another universe.

1497
00:58:35,020 --> 00:58:38,260
We're already sucked up in the black hole, but we never really knew it.

1498
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:40,500
Do you think a black hole can make me taller?

1499
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:41,760
I like how she's playing...

1500
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:43,300
Oh, you know Doobie's getting older.

1501
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:44,200
She's playing bingo.

1502
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:45,580
That's true.

1503
00:58:47,420 --> 00:58:49,460
She's almost close to retirement age.

1504
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:50,980
Wait, how old am I in this game right now?

1505
00:58:52,140 --> 00:58:53,730
You're like, maybe like 30s.

1506
00:58:55,060 --> 00:58:56,060
I'm in my 30s?

1507
00:58:56,060 --> 00:58:57,200
Yeah, you're...

1508
00:58:57,840 --> 00:58:59,040
No, she doesn't.

1509
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:02,040
But she's like two zones away from us.

1510
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:03,220
And we're almost retiring.

1511
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:05,400
We're literally right next to retirement.

1512
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:08,020
Oh, hey!

1513
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:10,320
You're getting old, dog.

1514
00:59:10,540 --> 00:59:13,540
Wait, if you sell now, you can get 700...

1515
00:59:13,540 --> 00:59:15,640
You can get like the sell price back now.

1516
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:17,100
Uh, okay.

1517
00:59:17,820 --> 00:59:18,300
Wait!

1518
00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:19,980
Can I buy your house back, please?

1519
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:23,600
I wanna buy your space shuttle house, please, dog.

1520
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:24,140
It looks sick.

1521
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:26,080
Okay, I'll sell this one instead.

1522
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:27,600
When selling a house, you have six offers.

1523
00:59:27,940 --> 00:59:28,160
Okay.

1524
00:59:29,140 --> 00:59:30,940
The offer number three is mine.

1525
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:33,820
I just pick any?

1526
00:59:34,060 --> 00:59:34,300
Yep.

1527
00:59:35,460 --> 00:59:36,960
You didn't pick my offer?

1528
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:39,380
You can try it.

1529
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:40,420
That's my offer.

1530
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:40,960
Come on, take that.

1531
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:42,120
That's less.

1532
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:43,720
Please, please, please.

1533
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:48,860
Let's go gambling.

1534
00:59:48,860 --> 00:59:50,300
You shouldn't have taken my offer.

1535
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:52,440
Let's go gambling.

1536
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:52,820
Let's go gambling.

1537
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:56,060
This game sucks so bad.

1538
00:59:56,420 --> 00:59:58,100
Hey, you got 10k profit.

1539
00:59:58,340 --> 00:59:59,020
Good for you.

1540
01:00:02,860 --> 01:00:05,760
Chat, should I go risky route or should I go safe route?

1541
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:06,420
Go risky.

1542
01:00:06,740 --> 01:00:07,700
What you have to lose?

1543
01:00:07,820 --> 01:00:08,960
You're literally a millionaire.

1544
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:10,400
Sorry, I'm always protected.

1545
01:00:11,420 --> 01:00:13,660
Yeah, what are you stressing for, millionaire?

1546
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:17,020
I'm living out of my car.

1547
01:00:17,980 --> 01:00:20,580
You can literally get a house.

1548
01:00:20,580 --> 01:00:21,600
I'm continuing my life.

1549
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:23,900
Wait, you're still there?

1550
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:26,480
I'm continuing my life, gentlemen.

1551
01:00:26,620 --> 01:00:29,040
You're not even close to the house.

1552
01:00:29,340 --> 01:00:31,540
I'm continuing my life.

1553
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:33,680
Frick this.

1554
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:35,280
We're never gonna finish this round.

1555
01:00:36,780 --> 01:00:40,120
80% of this stream is her trying to spin the wheel.

1556
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:43,400
What did I get?

1557
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:46,380
Three, two, one, explosion.

1558
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:47,900
I have an action.

1559
01:00:48,660 --> 01:00:50,280
Oh my god, bowling?

1560
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:52,980
Who wants to go bowling?

1561
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:53,840
Come on.

1562
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:57,940
Let's go bowling.

1563
01:00:58,220 --> 01:00:58,900
Bow, you wanna go bowling?

1564
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:01,040
She's gonna risk it.

1565
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:02,180
Doobie, you wanna go bowling?

1566
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:05,160
Doge, you wanna go bowling?

1567
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:05,640
No.

1568
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:13,940
Dude, if you beat me, I'm calling you Doob.

1569
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:15,600
If I beat you, I'm calling you Dookie.

1570
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:16,760
Okay.

1571
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:19,140
Oh, what if I win?

1572
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:20,540
Then I get to call you...

1573
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:22,220
Call me Fart.

1574
01:01:22,820 --> 01:01:23,600
I don't know.

1575
01:01:24,460 --> 01:01:24,980
Fertilizer.

1576
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:29,800
If she got four, you have a chance.

1577
01:01:31,220 --> 01:01:31,740
Fowlian.

1578
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:37,420
What is the streamer luck?

1579
01:01:37,700 --> 01:01:39,720
Say my name.

1580
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:42,820
What is her streamer luck right there?

1581
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:45,560
I don't know.

1582
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:47,160
She can barely spin the wheel.

1583
01:01:47,580 --> 01:01:47,800
Okay.

1584
01:01:49,180 --> 01:01:50,980
Doobie, I won't call you that.

1585
01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:53,340
Action time.

1586
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:56,080
Unless you have your written permission.

1587
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:57,880
I'm gonna sell my house right now.

1588
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:00,000
May I call you Dookie?

1589
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:01,800
No.

1590
01:02:05,660 --> 01:02:07,020
I'm gonna sell my house.

1591
01:02:07,460 --> 01:02:08,440
I'm gonna do it now.

1592
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:10,220
I have to do it anyway.

1593
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:11,960
All right.

1594
01:02:12,580 --> 01:02:13,420
All right.

1595
01:02:14,980 --> 01:02:15,980
That's my Dookie.

1596
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:17,200
All right.

1597
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:19,020
Okay, here we go.

1598
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:21,620
No, no, no, no.

1599
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:22,480
You want the bottom one.

1600
01:02:23,060 --> 01:02:24,300
That's pretty good.

1601
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:27,540
That's really good already.

1602
01:02:27,860 --> 01:02:30,680
I get like a 100k, almost a 100k profit.

1603
01:02:31,460 --> 01:02:34,220
I mean, I already saw what happened to Bow.

1604
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:38,180
I already saw what happened to Bow.

1605
01:02:38,180 --> 01:02:40,120
I don't want to talk about it.

1606
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:42,360
You want to pick the bottom right, trust me.

1607
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:44,360
I'll take it.

1608
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:45,940
I'm gonna take it.

1609
01:02:46,300 --> 01:02:47,560
I'm gonna take it.

1610
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:49,540
That's 80k profit right there.

1611
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:50,960
Watch it be like 700k.

1612
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:52,340
We don't know.

1613
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:53,360
We'll never know.

1614
01:02:56,860 --> 01:02:58,960
Wait, so you guys are all homeless now.

1615
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:00,000
Just like me.

1616
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:01,380
No, Bow has two houses.

1617
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:03,440
Yeah, I'm just renting.

1618
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:05,440
I'm renting now.

1619
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:07,320
I live on my moped.

1620
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:08,180
Yeah.

1621
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:11,680
So how does that work?

1622
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:12,640
You got like a blanket or something?

1623
01:03:12,660 --> 01:03:15,520
She's doing like the van life, but like on a moped.

1624
01:03:16,460 --> 01:03:18,160
It's one of those ones that has a blanket.

1625
01:03:19,220 --> 01:03:20,200
Wait, you got a tie.

1626
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:21,740
Oh, you get a raise.

1627
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:24,020
I'm gonna get a raise this time.

1628
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:25,620
Is that a $10,000 raise?

1629
01:03:25,740 --> 01:03:26,420
You got scammed.

1630
01:03:28,180 --> 01:03:31,840
There are too many black hole explorers out there.

1631
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:33,580
It's like IT.

1632
01:03:34,140 --> 01:03:38,060
Where everybody learns IT, but now there's too many IT technicians.

1633
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:39,920
Not everyone's IT.

1634
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:43,220
What are the immortality rates of being a black hole explorer?

1635
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:45,500
Because that doesn't sound like a very long-lived profession.

1636
01:03:45,940 --> 01:03:49,120
Oh, someone said you can connect a trailer to a moped.

1637
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:50,220
That's true.

1638
01:03:52,460 --> 01:03:53,280
Alright, Bow.

1639
01:03:53,300 --> 01:03:54,260
Oh, do I have to do it?

1640
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:55,520
Yes, it's your turn.

1641
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:58,540
Can anyone explore a black hole?

1642
01:03:59,780 --> 01:04:00,340
Anyone?

1643
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:01,360
Anyone?

1644
01:04:01,740 --> 01:04:03,200
Oh, she's about to retire!

1645
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:04,640
Moneys.

1646
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:07,320
Nearly one space away from retirement.

1647
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:11,920
Why do I have a family movie night when I don't have a family?

1648
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:14,800
Because I invited you over to my car.

1649
01:04:15,220 --> 01:04:16,660
Aww, I'm godmother.

1650
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:18,420
You're a godmother?

1651
01:04:19,060 --> 01:04:20,840
That's free babysitting for her.

1652
01:04:22,420 --> 01:04:23,720
That's what godmothers are.

1653
01:04:23,740 --> 01:04:24,740
Bow, can you teach my kids?

1654
01:04:25,260 --> 01:04:25,460
No.

1655
01:04:26,140 --> 01:04:26,460
Okay.

1656
01:04:27,060 --> 01:04:28,800
Are you not even sending your kids to school?

1657
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:29,960
40k salary with benefits.

1658
01:04:31,080 --> 01:04:31,600
Alright, fine.

1659
01:04:31,660 --> 01:04:32,880
How about you start teaching your fans?

1660
01:04:33,100 --> 01:04:34,740
Make it up in class on being down bad.

1661
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:35,440
Okay.

1662
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:39,540
What is your problem?

1663
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:41,260
Do you have this shit written down or something?

1664
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:44,020
You know what?

1665
01:04:44,660 --> 01:04:45,500
I'm gonna go in then.

1666
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:45,720
Fine.

1667
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:46,140
You wanna go in?

1668
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:48,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1669
01:04:48,260 --> 01:04:48,680
Put me in.

1670
01:04:49,580 --> 01:04:50,220
Okay, fine.

1671
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:52,700
Bow, your butt has more fans than your music.

1672
01:04:52,700 --> 01:04:53,100
Woah!

1673
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:56,440
Take that back now!

1674
01:04:56,860 --> 01:05:00,460
You used to drop an album called The Rear View.

1675
01:05:01,220 --> 01:05:04,600
Okay, why is my most viewed video on my channel a music video?

1676
01:05:05,180 --> 01:05:06,660
Oh, why is your most viewed clip your butt?

1677
01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:11,100
Didn't you start- weren't you like a singer before you became a VTuber though?

1678
01:05:11,340 --> 01:05:11,700
Yeah.

1679
01:05:15,860 --> 01:05:18,640
Music video pre-VTubing.

1680
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:22,500
Poor game battle.

1681
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:26,720
I literally- That's not fair because I literally retired.

1682
01:05:29,120 --> 01:05:30,660
I challenge you all to a poor game battle.

1683
01:05:31,860 --> 01:05:35,500
Bro, how is she like- She's so lucky in this.

1684
01:05:35,620 --> 01:05:36,400
Oh, JK!

1685
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:41,720
Oh my god, this is the first time I get something that's not the one.

1686
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:46,120
Yeah, that's right.

1687
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:47,680
You scammed us.

1688
01:05:48,820 --> 01:05:52,320
What do you mean, you started the poor game battle?

1689
01:05:53,380 --> 01:05:55,280
Oh yeah, well maybe I'm bored of this game.

1690
01:05:55,480 --> 01:05:57,060
Woah, you picked this game.

1691
01:05:57,480 --> 01:05:57,860
Oh yeah?

1692
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:02,280
Well...

1693
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:03,680
Yeah, go on.

1694
01:06:04,940 --> 01:06:05,420
Um...

1695
01:06:05,420 --> 01:06:07,100
What does that say about your game choices?

1696
01:06:08,060 --> 01:06:08,540
Um...

1697
01:06:08,540 --> 01:06:12,940
My face doesn't look like a- My forehead doesn't look like a poor game.

1698
01:06:12,940 --> 01:06:16,900
You're not even like- You're not even like in the screen anymore.

1699
01:06:20,340 --> 01:06:26,820
You're not even- No, I'm saying you're literally- You're not even like- Bow, is she in view for you?

1700
01:06:27,340 --> 01:06:29,180
No, I'm using her foogie right now.

1701
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:34,220
Don't do it!

1702
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:37,080
You're literally like not even showing up.

1703
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:37,920
Yeah, you're gone.

1704
01:06:46,680 --> 01:06:49,060
Yeah, I'm the first one to retire!

1705
01:06:50,060 --> 01:06:51,080
Let's go!

1706
01:06:52,900 --> 01:06:54,100
Alright, choose pension.

1707
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:58,520
I'm gonna go for pension.

1708
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:00,420
I don't need to be fulfilled.

1709
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:02,680
I don't need to be fulfilled.

1710
01:07:02,860 --> 01:07:03,920
I'm just gonna be here.

1711
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:05,060
Where are you going?

1712
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:08,040
I'm going to the spirit world.

1713
01:07:08,300 --> 01:07:08,920
Did you just die?

1714
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:11,080
I'm in the spirit world now.

1715
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:12,620
Did I just watch you die?

1716
01:07:13,020 --> 01:07:15,040
Yeah, I transcended.

1717
01:07:18,020 --> 01:07:20,340
Where the fuck are you?

1718
01:07:20,580 --> 01:07:21,980
I am in Narnia!

1719
01:07:23,660 --> 01:07:25,060
I'm putting a foogie now.

1720
01:07:25,580 --> 01:07:27,460
Yeah, I'm literally using her foogie.

1721
01:07:27,460 --> 01:07:28,620
She disappeared.

1722
01:07:28,840 --> 01:07:31,260
She literally disappeared on my screen.

1723
01:07:31,260 --> 01:07:33,280
Dude, literally, I'm...

1724
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:35,060
Okay, let me check if my thing's working.

1725
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:37,980
I think it stopped working.

1726
01:07:38,340 --> 01:07:39,820
Oh, it did stop working.

1727
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:42,360
No, it's fine.

1728
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:44,200
Your foogie is funnier next to us.

1729
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:45,760
No, no, don't worry.

1730
01:07:45,820 --> 01:07:46,520
I'll figure it out.

1731
01:07:46,540 --> 01:07:48,080
Wait, can you give me her foogie link?

1732
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:51,040
I'm fixing it.

1733
01:07:51,780 --> 01:07:52,640
Please don't give me my...

1734
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:54,400
No, your foogie...

1735
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:56,060
You're gonna be 2D.

1736
01:07:56,860 --> 01:07:59,520
You've lost your 3D privileges.

1737
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:01,420
No, I literally...

1738
01:08:01,420 --> 01:08:04,680
Your 3D is too hard to see.

1739
01:08:04,700 --> 01:08:06,580
I literally just fixed it, bro.

1740
01:08:06,980 --> 01:08:09,260
You've lost your 3D privileges.

1741
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:10,100
I literally just fixed it.

1742
01:08:10,840 --> 01:08:11,640
Alright, I'm out.

1743
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:14,520
Yeah, and I hit him now, okay.

1744
01:08:14,980 --> 01:08:17,200
Let's go, we're all finished now.

1745
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:18,260
Here.

1746
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:19,840
Oh, god.

1747
01:08:20,180 --> 01:08:20,520
No, no, no.

1748
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:21,700
Go again.

1749
01:08:22,540 --> 01:08:23,800
Oh, I can't.

1750
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:25,200
I don't have any attempts.

1751
01:08:25,860 --> 01:08:26,200
Oh, no.

1752
01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:28,100
Girls, girls, girls, check the Discord message.

1753
01:08:28,280 --> 01:08:29,180
Check the Discord message.

1754
01:08:29,860 --> 01:08:30,480
Bucket list.

1755
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:33,780
Where to retire.

1756
01:08:34,440 --> 01:08:36,160
3D privileges lost.

1757
01:08:37,180 --> 01:08:39,580
You're now gonna be 2D with the rest of us.

1758
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:41,220
You just emoted me to a JPEG.

1759
01:08:41,320 --> 01:08:41,580
Yeah.

1760
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:45,460
We're animated PNGs, technically.

1761
01:08:45,840 --> 01:08:47,480
I can't even move my shoulders anymore.

1762
01:08:47,780 --> 01:08:49,020
Spin to collect my pension.

1763
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:50,300
Wait, God.

1764
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:51,180
Yo, God-Chan.

1765
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:54,660
Thank you, God-Chan.

1766
01:08:54,660 --> 01:08:56,740
Thank you, God-Chan.

1767
01:08:56,740 --> 01:08:57,640
Alright, Fillion, your turn.

1768
01:08:58,220 --> 01:09:01,440
You see, you see, you call me fertilizer, but my profile picture is- Oh, my God, I'm almost 2 mil.

1769
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:05,560
Wait, I hella- Yeah, I locked in.

1770
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:07,480
Wait, you made it 2 mil?

1771
01:09:08,320 --> 01:09:08,980
Oh, wait, no.

1772
01:09:08,980 --> 01:09:10,560
No, no, she's still 1 mil.

1773
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:14,460
But with the Ray Fillion's going, we might be 2 mil.

1774
01:09:14,680 --> 01:09:16,180
No, no, no, no, guys, I'm gonna do the math.

1775
01:09:16,240 --> 01:09:17,960
See if it's a 1 now, it turns into what?

1776
01:09:18,040 --> 01:09:18,780
Here it is, conversion.

1777
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:22,920
A 1 turns into a 4, so I'm gonna stroll a 6, and then turn into a 10.

1778
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:25,240
Come on.

1779
01:09:25,340 --> 01:09:26,300
Risky or safe?

1780
01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:26,900
Go risky.

1781
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:28,660
You can get a house in risky.

1782
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:30,060
Oh, yeah?

1783
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:32,360
Well...

1784
01:09:32,360 --> 01:09:34,100
Do you want a house for your family?

1785
01:09:34,220 --> 01:09:35,420
What gets me more kids?

1786
01:09:36,100 --> 01:09:36,560
Risky.

1787
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:39,620
That's literally what I mean.

1788
01:09:40,780 --> 01:09:42,100
I wanna risk it.

1789
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:44,040
One risky, two safe, what do we do?

1790
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:46,900
I think safe doesn't give you children.

1791
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:48,320
That's all I'm gonna say.

1792
01:09:48,320 --> 01:09:52,320
It's true, I don't believe in protection anymore, I guess.

1793
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:52,760
I don't know.

1794
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:53,760
Risky?

1795
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:55,120
Anymore.

1796
01:09:57,080 --> 01:09:58,060
Risk it, risk it.

1797
01:09:58,080 --> 01:09:59,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1798
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:01,920
What's the worst that could happen?

1799
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:03,020
Girls, I did the math.

1800
01:10:04,420 --> 01:10:06,920
A 1 turned into a 4, so a 6 is gonna turn into a 10.

1801
01:10:07,060 --> 01:10:07,260
Watch.

1802
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:09,960
I can't even click on this stuff.

1803
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:11,480
Okay, here we go.

1804
01:10:11,780 --> 01:10:14,180
Easy 10, easy 10, easy 10.

1805
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:15,420
Oh, okay.

1806
01:10:15,420 --> 01:10:16,720
Okay, I was close.

1807
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:18,160
Doobie!

1808
01:10:18,580 --> 01:10:19,700
Oh, the doobie tax.

1809
01:10:20,700 --> 01:10:21,500
Thank you.

1810
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:27,220
You can have a chance to have a house or pay taxes.

1811
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:28,320
Or kids.

1812
01:10:29,460 --> 01:10:30,560
Do you think I should book a mall?

1813
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:31,620
Oh, kids!

1814
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:33,900
There's a chance for you to have children.

1815
01:10:34,680 --> 01:10:35,960
Watch this chat, watch this.

1816
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:39,560
So if I go and put it right here, and when I press space, it's gonna put it into kids, watch.

1817
01:10:40,280 --> 01:10:41,360
Am I the only one that heard that?

1818
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:44,460
Am I the only one?

1819
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:46,840
No, I heard it too.

1820
01:10:46,940 --> 01:10:48,360
But now I don't want to enable her.

1821
01:10:49,540 --> 01:10:50,320
That's crazy.

1822
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:51,560
Wow.

1823
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:54,460
All that shit talk about my ass.

1824
01:10:54,460 --> 01:10:57,240
All that shit talk, and then she had to pay taxes.

1825
01:10:57,740 --> 01:10:58,520
That's unfortunate.

1826
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:00,400
That's so unfortunate.

1827
01:11:01,300 --> 01:11:03,740
Did you know the IRS caught up to me this year after three years of evasion?

1828
01:11:03,860 --> 01:11:05,300
Oh, hey, look, another 100k.

1829
01:11:05,460 --> 01:11:06,300
Hey, hey.

1830
01:11:06,740 --> 01:11:08,160
Single moms be like.

1831
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:13,000
Wait, I'm actually catching up to Fillion now in terms of money, pension money.

1832
01:11:13,380 --> 01:11:13,700
Please.

1833
01:11:13,700 --> 01:11:15,200
Someone please catch her.

1834
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:16,200
Anyone.

1835
01:11:17,740 --> 01:11:19,580
Hey, Doobie, you're almost retiring.

1836
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:22,160
I'm almost at the finish line.

1837
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:23,560
Oh, you're almost there.

1838
01:11:23,700 --> 01:11:25,120
You're almost there.

1839
01:11:25,380 --> 01:11:26,300
Thank god, Fillion.

1840
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:29,600
Play Sudoku hard, Grandma.

1841
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:30,020
Chill out.

1842
01:11:30,020 --> 01:11:31,800
This is fucking lame.

1843
01:11:32,220 --> 01:11:33,320
Wait, Doobie, Doobie.

1844
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:35,740
Can you hop on a monkey bar anymore or are you just too geriatric?

1845
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:37,840
Oh, I'm too geriatric.

1846
01:11:37,980 --> 01:11:39,040
My knees are gone.

1847
01:11:39,220 --> 01:11:39,960
Oh, no.

1848
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:41,100
What happened?

1849
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:42,000
Donated them.

1850
01:11:42,700 --> 01:11:43,220
Arthritis.

1851
01:11:43,580 --> 01:11:44,980
What happened, Doobie?

1852
01:11:46,780 --> 01:11:48,500
It's the gravity, space gravity.

1853
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:50,460
I lost in two black hole incident.

1854
01:11:50,780 --> 01:11:51,440
That's true.

1855
01:11:52,060 --> 01:11:53,180
I can't believe.

1856
01:11:53,560 --> 01:11:56,720
If I could travel back in time, I'll go back and kill Isaac Newton.

1857
01:11:57,420 --> 01:11:59,120
So we won't have gravity anymore.

1858
01:11:59,660 --> 01:12:01,240
He doesn't want to live in space or earth.

1859
01:12:02,060 --> 01:12:04,800
It's because of him for inventing gravity.

1860
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:05,960
Wait, Doobie, I almost caught up to you.

1861
01:12:06,920 --> 01:12:07,180
Really?

1862
01:12:07,180 --> 01:12:08,800
Yeah, I'm right behind you.

1863
01:12:09,080 --> 01:12:10,460
If I roll a two, I catch up.

1864
01:12:11,780 --> 01:12:11,940
Alright.

1865
01:12:12,260 --> 01:12:13,400
We should not let that happen.

1866
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:14,380
See you later, Grandma.

1867
01:12:16,060 --> 01:12:17,240
So I rolled an eight.

1868
01:12:17,320 --> 01:12:18,300
Watch, an eight turns into a ten.

1869
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:20,460
Alright, we're watching.

1870
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:21,780
Eight turns into a ten.

1871
01:12:22,160 --> 01:12:23,080
Oh, hey, look, a three.

1872
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:24,480
Oh, but you caught up to her.

1873
01:12:25,620 --> 01:12:26,700
Wait, and you get paid.

1874
01:12:29,160 --> 01:12:29,880
Jesus Christ.

1875
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:30,460
Alright.

1876
01:12:31,780 --> 01:12:32,740
Time to roll.

1877
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:35,000
Aw, 10k.

1878
01:12:35,140 --> 01:12:36,260
Fuck, okay, that's fine.

1879
01:12:36,660 --> 01:12:38,180
I got 200k anywhere earlier.

1880
01:12:39,460 --> 01:12:40,820
You're just getting money from rolling?

1881
01:12:40,840 --> 01:12:42,960
Yeah, if you retire first, you get...

1882
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:44,460
You just wait and roll.

1883
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,260
So you just get a bunch of money?

1884
01:12:46,460 --> 01:12:48,560
Wait, you caught up to me in money.

1885
01:12:49,140 --> 01:12:50,600
Yeah, exactly.

1886
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:52,680
I'm going to lose.

1887
01:12:53,580 --> 01:12:54,220
Damn it.

1888
01:12:54,420 --> 01:12:55,860
Oh no, taxes!

1889
01:12:56,280 --> 01:12:58,500
Oh no!

1890
01:13:00,220 --> 01:13:00,740
Taxes!

1891
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:02,400
Taxes!

1892
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:04,340
Doki, I...

1893
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:05,520
Frick you.

1894
01:13:05,660 --> 01:13:08,920
Also, Doobie, if you ever have too many taxes, you can just jump in the hole.

1895
01:13:09,220 --> 01:13:11,320
Okay, that's good, I guess.

1896
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:14,480
Like, I'm not the only one that's retired.

1897
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:15,540
That is true.

1898
01:13:17,380 --> 01:13:20,360
I'm going to walk into the nursing home and steal your bingo cards.

1899
01:13:22,260 --> 01:13:23,940
Bingo player is Doobie right now.

1900
01:13:23,980 --> 01:13:25,120
She's not retired yet.

1901
01:13:25,300 --> 01:13:26,420
I'm going to put laxatives in the tapioca.

1902
01:13:26,420 --> 01:13:28,240
Oh my god.

1903
01:13:28,780 --> 01:13:30,420
You know what you actually get?

1904
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:32,600
I will leave the stove on with mail on top.

1905
01:13:32,720 --> 01:13:33,980
You know what that's called?

1906
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:37,900
It'll be an old woman in a crotch chair running away from a fire.

1907
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:39,640
You know what that's called?

1908
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:42,720
That's called elderly abuse and you can go to jail.

1909
01:13:45,380 --> 01:13:46,860
What if it's an accident?

1910
01:13:49,980 --> 01:13:52,900
Doobie, you know a little bit too much about elderly abuse.

1911
01:13:52,900 --> 01:13:53,240
You see?

1912
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:56,780
Grandma's on the loose again.

1913
01:13:58,220 --> 01:14:00,460
The third player to reach retirement.

1914
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:02,320
Yay, you retired.

1915
01:14:03,160 --> 01:14:03,680
Now what?

1916
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:05,000
You need to do a bucket list.

1917
01:14:06,100 --> 01:14:07,140
Oh, bucket list, hell yeah.

1918
01:14:07,660 --> 01:14:08,640
And just keep spinning.

1919
01:14:09,020 --> 01:14:11,180
See what you get.

1920
01:14:11,260 --> 01:14:12,080
Am I last?

1921
01:14:12,540 --> 01:14:15,320
No, no, no, no.

1922
01:14:15,460 --> 01:14:17,020
Listen, guys, I can do the math.

1923
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:19,460
You have nine knowledge and Bao has six banks.

1924
01:14:19,460 --> 01:14:21,180
Which means it's wasting my time.

1925
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:23,460
So if I want to win, I go for knowledge and money.

1926
01:14:23,780 --> 01:14:24,540
Yeah, you go.

1927
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:27,700
I'm going in for my pension, baby.

1928
01:14:28,260 --> 01:14:30,640
What happened to not fulfilling your life?

1929
01:14:31,160 --> 01:14:33,220
Well, it turns out I wanted to see you die.

1930
01:14:33,320 --> 01:14:34,140
It's my last mission.

1931
01:14:37,020 --> 01:14:39,620
It's like a bunch of retired people in a nursing office together.

1932
01:14:39,620 --> 01:14:40,860
I'm scared of you every day.

1933
01:14:40,980 --> 01:14:43,780
You literally abandoned your husband and your kid.

1934
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:47,240
My kid grew up and he was a furry.

1935
01:14:47,240 --> 01:14:48,680
So I did what I had to.

1936
01:14:48,840 --> 01:14:53,080
You literally left your husband and kid for a pension.

1937
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:56,120
You went there by yourself.

1938
01:14:56,520 --> 01:14:58,480
I told him I had a job to do.

1939
01:14:58,600 --> 01:15:00,500
And I looked at you and I'm like, say my name, doki.

1940
01:15:00,900 --> 01:15:03,400
To your husband?

1941
01:15:03,700 --> 01:15:06,280
You looked into his eyes and say my name.

1942
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:09,040
We're good.

1943
01:15:11,180 --> 01:15:11,700
Alright.

1944
01:15:12,260 --> 01:15:13,680
Our last spin, Bao.

1945
01:15:13,680 --> 01:15:15,680
Our last retirement spin before...

1946
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:21,180
We're all gonna get doobie taxed.

1947
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:22,300
It's okay.

1948
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:23,580
Are you still there?

1949
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:25,940
It's just doobie.

1950
01:15:26,780 --> 01:15:28,760
There's no way you get a one.

1951
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:29,960
There's no way.

1952
01:15:30,460 --> 01:15:31,220
Don't say that.

1953
01:15:31,340 --> 01:15:35,880
You gave yourself money too.

1954
01:15:36,300 --> 01:15:36,900
Oh, okay.

1955
01:15:38,620 --> 01:15:39,100
Congrats.

1956
01:15:39,450 --> 01:15:40,600
That's 300k.

1957
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:41,120
Congrats.

1958
01:15:42,100 --> 01:15:43,420
Okay, I'm gonna pick the other one.

1959
01:15:43,500 --> 01:15:44,740
Since you guys all picked that one.

1960
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:46,560
Let's see what happens.

1961
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,260
Oh, you're going to the black hole.

1962
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:56,960
She literally went to the black hole.

1963
01:16:00,520 --> 01:16:01,020
Oh,

1964
01:16:04,900 --> 01:16:05,660
you got nothing.

1965
01:16:11,020 --> 01:16:12,520
What was that?

1966
01:16:12,820 --> 01:16:14,700
I think Fillion won.

1967
01:16:14,980 --> 01:16:15,360
Did I?

1968
01:16:16,360 --> 01:16:17,520
Yeah, I think you did.

1969
01:16:19,940 --> 01:16:22,540
This is like the total money you get.

1970
01:16:23,060 --> 01:16:25,180
But you also get like bonus stuff.

1971
01:16:25,400 --> 01:16:26,700
But like Fillion had the most...

1972
01:16:27,160 --> 01:16:29,120
She fulfilled her life a lot.

1973
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:34,400
Oh, okay.

1974
01:16:34,680 --> 01:16:35,200
You know what?

1975
01:16:36,200 --> 01:16:37,220
Who's holding the bonus?

1976
01:16:37,220 --> 01:16:38,840
Oh yeah, she got the bonus.

1977
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:40,720
I hate Mario Party.

1978
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:47,800
Alright,

1979
01:16:52,120 --> 01:16:52,620
that's enough.

1980
01:16:52,980 --> 01:16:53,900
That's enough for you.

1981
01:16:56,960 --> 01:16:59,140
Alright, I have to remake the lobby.

1982
01:16:59,260 --> 01:16:59,880
Oh yeah, I forgot.

1983
01:17:00,040 --> 01:17:01,680
You gotta remake the lobby every time.

1984
01:17:04,240 --> 01:17:05,440
Sorry, I'm out of the lobby now.

1985
01:17:05,440 --> 01:17:07,020
So I'm not part of that game anymore.

1986
01:17:15,340 --> 01:17:18,000
We're doing a new lobby right now.

1987
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:25,380
Alright, so what map do you guys...

1988
01:17:25,380 --> 01:17:26,620
We have Haunted Hills.

1989
01:17:27,260 --> 01:17:28,600
We have Frozen Lands.

1990
01:17:28,820 --> 01:17:29,800
Sandy Shores.

1991
01:17:30,060 --> 01:17:31,080
Under the Sea.

1992
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:32,980
El Dorado.

1993
01:17:32,980 --> 01:17:34,520
Superhero World.

1994
01:17:36,020 --> 01:17:37,500
A normal?

1995
01:17:37,640 --> 01:17:38,320
You want the classic?

1996
01:17:39,320 --> 01:17:41,600
You wanna be a normal person?

1997
01:17:45,060 --> 01:17:46,560
Yeah, doobie pick.

1998
01:17:47,300 --> 01:17:48,980
I'm sorry, what were the options again?

1999
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:50,380
I literally won the game.

2000
01:17:50,540 --> 01:17:51,480
Fairy Tale Kingdom.

2001
01:17:51,940 --> 01:17:52,940
Haunted Hills.

2002
01:17:53,380 --> 01:17:54,300
Frozen Lands.

2003
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:55,820
Sandy Shores.

2004
01:17:56,360 --> 01:17:57,200
Sweet Haven.

2005
01:17:57,580 --> 01:17:58,540
Under the Sea.

2006
01:17:58,920 --> 01:17:59,840
El Dorado.

2007
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:02,080
And Superhero World.

2008
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:04,320
What is Sweet Haven?

2009
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:05,780
Oh, is that like sweets and stuff?

2010
01:18:05,780 --> 01:18:07,080
Yeah, yeah, it's like candy then.

2011
01:18:07,160 --> 01:18:08,020
How about Fairy Tale?

2012
01:18:08,240 --> 01:18:09,260
Oh, Fairy Tale.

2013
01:18:11,340 --> 01:18:14,880
We already have a jester here, so...

2014
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:15,820
Yeah, we already...

2015
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:18,160
What about the normal one?

2016
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:18,900
What about the normal one?

2017
01:18:19,180 --> 01:18:20,660
We'll do normal one.

2018
01:18:21,160 --> 01:18:23,880
Are you trying to say Fairy Tales are normal?

2019
01:18:24,680 --> 01:18:26,420
No, I just like saying like...

2020
01:18:26,420 --> 01:18:26,920
Ow, frick.

2021
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:29,200
Ow, frick.

2022
01:18:29,320 --> 01:18:30,920
I'm just saying, ow, frick.

2023
01:18:31,180 --> 01:18:32,220
My headset's spinning.

2024
01:18:33,020 --> 01:18:33,480
Oh, frick.

2025
01:18:33,680 --> 01:18:36,000
The normal one, no one's ever done it before.

2026
01:18:36,120 --> 01:18:38,520
The normal one is like...

2027
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:40,160
Maybe there's a reason.

2028
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:43,420
Yeah, maybe there's a reason why no one does the normal one.

2029
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:44,100
The normal one did win, so...

2030
01:18:44,100 --> 01:18:48,260
If you wanna play the normal one, just turn your computer off and extend your real life.

2031
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:49,920
Just go outside.

2032
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:53,060
Just go outside and play the normal one.

2033
01:18:56,360 --> 01:18:59,040
Does anyone wanna buy me a real job?

2034
01:19:00,660 --> 01:19:01,080
No.

2035
01:19:01,880 --> 01:19:05,760
Okay, if you guys quit streaming and became a normie, what would you do?

2036
01:19:07,740 --> 01:19:09,320
I'll do what my degree was.

2037
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:10,960
What was your degree?

2038
01:19:12,140 --> 01:19:13,540
Whatever it was.

2039
01:19:13,980 --> 01:19:15,700
That was not a helpful answer, dog.

2040
01:19:15,780 --> 01:19:17,300
You should've said when I was saying your degree.

2041
01:19:18,540 --> 01:19:21,280
Whatever it was, I'll do what my degree is.

2042
01:19:22,300 --> 01:19:23,340
Okay, so...

2043
01:19:23,340 --> 01:19:26,200
If I was not a streamer, I would join a maid cafe.

2044
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:27,580
It's my humble dream.

2045
01:19:28,820 --> 01:19:31,140
And I would serve people coffee.

2046
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:34,300
That's just like a barista.

2047
01:19:34,420 --> 01:19:35,720
That's just a barista, yeah.

2048
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:37,380
But I would be in an outfit.

2049
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:42,100
In Japan, I would move, I'd be like, Nihongo.

2050
01:19:44,120 --> 01:19:44,640
Okay.

2051
01:19:46,900 --> 01:19:50,240
I'd be like, Kawaii.

2052
01:19:50,280 --> 01:19:51,700
You know.

2053
01:19:54,820 --> 01:19:55,960
A girl can dream.

2054
01:19:56,900 --> 01:19:57,880
That's why it's called a dream.

2055
01:19:57,980 --> 01:19:58,800
Sorry, I haven't joined the lobby.

2056
01:20:00,120 --> 01:20:01,140
Don't worry, Doobie.

2057
01:20:01,320 --> 01:20:02,960
Nobody has joined the lobby.

2058
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:06,400
We were listening to Filian's dream.

2059
01:20:06,940 --> 01:20:09,220
Filian's dream that might never come true.

2060
01:20:09,400 --> 01:20:13,160
Don't you guys wanna share dreams for a little bit before we get back into an entire another game of life?

2061
01:20:14,320 --> 01:20:15,640
Wait, this is my dream.

2062
01:20:16,180 --> 01:20:17,420
Streaming was my dream.

2063
01:20:20,100 --> 01:20:20,820
Okay, fine.

2064
01:20:20,900 --> 01:20:21,700
Then I'll ask a different question.

2065
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:24,300
Would you rather fight a hundred dog-sized horses?

2066
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:27,340
How come after I say my dream, we go to a different question?

2067
01:20:27,460 --> 01:20:28,920
We didn't even hear the other people.

2068
01:20:29,960 --> 01:20:31,980
Why try and no one answered me?

2069
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:33,900
Doobie, what would you do if you weren't streaming?

2070
01:20:33,960 --> 01:20:35,400
You moved on before we could.

2071
01:20:35,460 --> 01:20:39,520
You ignored Bow and Doobie before they could say anything.

2072
01:20:40,360 --> 01:20:41,660
I'm more brave than a picture at this point.

2073
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:43,500
The slime TikToker.

2074
01:20:45,680 --> 01:20:47,300
Oh, a slime TikToker?

2075
01:20:47,300 --> 01:20:49,120
ASMR Squishy.

2076
01:20:49,260 --> 01:20:49,680
Slime ASMR?

2077
01:20:51,820 --> 01:20:52,800
That's genius.

2078
01:20:53,320 --> 01:20:54,120
Okay, okay.

2079
01:20:54,380 --> 01:20:57,460
Do you know people who made slime stuff?

2080
01:20:57,580 --> 01:20:58,820
They made so much money.

2081
01:20:59,100 --> 01:21:00,080
It's profitable.

2082
01:21:00,980 --> 01:21:02,180
It's still profitable, too.

2083
01:21:02,460 --> 01:21:04,040
That's because women don't know how to spend money.

2084
01:21:04,900 --> 01:21:05,280
What?

2085
01:21:05,860 --> 01:21:08,640
But we're all women.

2086
01:21:09,560 --> 01:21:10,820
Filian, how much have you spent?

2087
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:13,120
I'm a good example.

2088
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:14,580
Filian, how much have you spent?

2089
01:21:14,580 --> 01:21:14,760
A billion.

2090
01:21:17,720 --> 01:21:18,200
Filian.

2091
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:20,800
What does that say?

2092
01:21:21,780 --> 01:21:23,820
It means that I don't make good decisions.

2093
01:21:23,860 --> 01:21:25,580
Okay, so I'm going to tell you this is a fact, okay?

2094
01:21:25,660 --> 01:21:26,420
We know that.

2095
01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:29,480
Women are probably worse at driving than men.

2096
01:21:29,680 --> 01:21:29,940
Why?

2097
01:21:30,140 --> 01:21:33,460
Because I've only been in one accident while driving and it was my fault.

2098
01:21:34,260 --> 01:21:39,220
Statistically speaking, I'm breaking down the average for women united across the world.

2099
01:21:40,300 --> 01:21:42,620
It would be fucked up if this month is women's month.

2100
01:21:42,620 --> 01:21:43,300
Pikmi sweets?

2101
01:21:44,260 --> 01:21:46,040
No, this isn't a Pikmi sweet!

2102
01:21:46,140 --> 01:21:47,120
Okay, well then...

2103
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:49,160
Filian's a Pikmi girl!

2104
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:53,200
I bought a Pikmi!

2105
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:56,900
I'm not like other women.

2106
01:21:59,880 --> 01:22:00,840
What is a Pikmi?

2107
01:22:01,340 --> 01:22:02,880
Everyone point to that.

2108
01:22:04,260 --> 01:22:06,420
What is a Pikmi, bro?

2109
01:22:06,420 --> 01:22:08,540
Is that the name of a plant?

2110
01:22:09,500 --> 01:22:12,180
The bird of Pikmi from Dark Souls 1?

2111
01:22:13,960 --> 01:22:14,560
Pikmi?

2112
01:22:15,400 --> 01:22:16,840
What is a Pikmin?

2113
01:22:17,340 --> 01:22:20,920
Yeah, you can say it like that.

2114
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:21,560
Pikmin!

2115
01:22:23,040 --> 01:22:25,580
We have to lobby out.

2116
01:22:25,880 --> 01:22:27,260
I would be a farmer.

2117
01:22:28,240 --> 01:22:29,960
Oh, a farmer?

2118
01:22:30,300 --> 01:22:31,000
What kind of farmer?

2119
01:22:32,180 --> 01:22:33,340
I don't know.

2120
01:22:33,340 --> 01:22:35,900
I think I'd want to have like a petting zoo.

2121
01:22:36,040 --> 01:22:38,920
And then I would have like a TikTok for it.

2122
01:22:38,980 --> 01:22:41,600
Oh, I've seen those farm TikToks.

2123
01:22:41,660 --> 01:22:43,080
Can we do stuff without TikTok?

2124
01:22:45,140 --> 01:22:47,380
It might be banned in America soon.

2125
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:50,160
With ducks, right?

2126
01:22:50,720 --> 01:22:52,260
Yeah, the ones on Twitch.

2127
01:22:52,580 --> 01:22:55,180
Where they put streams of animals and stuff.

2128
01:22:56,160 --> 01:22:57,100
That's really cute.

2129
01:22:57,140 --> 01:22:59,260
And you can feed them too by sending biddies.

2130
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:01,140
That's my exit plan.

2131
01:23:01,140 --> 01:23:06,460
Oh yeah, build a robot that when it gets bits, it just releases crumbs onto the ground for them.

2132
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:08,220
That's so smart!

2133
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:09,820
That's what some of them do.

2134
01:23:10,060 --> 01:23:13,140
If you donate biddies, it sends food out to the animals.

2135
01:23:13,420 --> 01:23:14,900
Belle, Belle, can you hire me?

2136
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:16,160
Put the robot, I'll do it.

2137
01:23:17,940 --> 01:23:19,600
He's on the walkie-talkie.

2138
01:23:19,820 --> 01:23:23,360
He'd be like, they sent in the pumps, we'll throw them out now.

2139
01:23:25,700 --> 01:23:27,640
Are we waiting on one person?

2140
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:28,400
Oh, I see.

2141
01:23:31,140 --> 01:23:34,940
I can tell when Doobie looked at her monitor.

2142
01:23:37,140 --> 01:23:43,400
I don't know if you saw it, but the moment Doobie turned her head and looked at the monitor, she was missing.

2143
01:23:47,180 --> 01:23:49,240
I just like clicking on stuff.

2144
01:23:50,900 --> 01:23:54,580
Okay, Doki and Belle's chat, give me a one if you just want us to talk for a little bit.

2145
01:23:54,600 --> 01:23:55,320
You know, as friends.

2146
01:23:56,300 --> 01:23:58,100
We can talk while we game.

2147
01:23:58,100 --> 01:23:59,580
Alright, alright.

2148
01:24:00,180 --> 01:24:01,960
That game time is for combat.

2149
01:24:04,100 --> 01:24:04,300
Okay.

2150
01:24:05,320 --> 01:24:06,900
Billion cat multitask.

2151
01:24:07,460 --> 01:24:07,860
Okay.

2152
01:24:08,720 --> 01:24:14,320
Actually, as an entertainer, it does make it hard to multitask when you're trying to think of stuff to say.

2153
01:24:14,420 --> 01:24:14,780
You know what I'm saying?

2154
01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:15,820
You have to think?

2155
01:24:17,080 --> 01:24:17,880
Um, alright.

2156
01:24:20,620 --> 01:24:22,320
Do you not have to think when you talk?

2157
01:24:22,580 --> 01:24:24,380
No, it just comes out of my mouth.

2158
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:26,240
That's impressive.

2159
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:29,460
That what you've been saying is what you've been thinking about.

2160
01:24:30,020 --> 01:24:31,320
Chat, the code was 8694.

2161
01:24:33,260 --> 01:24:33,680
Idiots.

2162
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:36,240
Okay, I'm ready.

2163
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:38,100
Wait, can I not be pink?

2164
01:24:38,360 --> 01:24:38,580
Oh, I'm pink.

2165
01:24:38,900 --> 01:24:41,440
You change your colors now.

2166
01:24:41,820 --> 01:24:42,700
You clutched, you clutched.

2167
01:24:42,820 --> 01:24:46,920
I'll be brown again, chat.

2168
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:47,620
What do you guys think?

2169
01:24:48,160 --> 01:24:49,180
Brown for fertilizer.

2170
01:24:49,500 --> 01:24:50,600
Yeah, brown for fertilizer.

2171
01:24:51,080 --> 01:24:53,420
Yeah, call me fertilizer one more time and see what happens.

2172
01:24:53,420 --> 01:24:54,860
Which one was fertilizer?

2173
01:24:55,460 --> 01:24:56,760
You know what's cool about fertilizer?

2174
01:24:57,720 --> 01:24:59,240
It makes plants grow.

2175
01:24:59,420 --> 01:25:01,180
Yeah, it's made out of cow shit.

2176
01:25:01,660 --> 01:25:02,020
Okay.

2177
01:25:02,740 --> 01:25:03,660
What do you think?

2178
01:25:03,900 --> 01:25:06,160
Cows make methane, which is good for the atmosphere.

2179
01:25:06,440 --> 01:25:07,080
No, it's not.

2180
01:25:07,300 --> 01:25:07,860
That is not.

2181
01:25:10,100 --> 01:25:12,360
Well, cows are good for the atmosphere in general.

2182
01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:14,440
Guys, this is why we need to eat cows.

2183
01:25:14,700 --> 01:25:15,820
To save the environment.

2184
01:25:16,380 --> 01:25:17,460
They're my favorite animal.

2185
01:25:17,540 --> 01:25:19,600
We gotta eat cows to save the environment.

2186
01:25:20,760 --> 01:25:22,120
Who the frick's a skateboard now?

2187
01:25:22,600 --> 01:25:23,440
That's Bao.

2188
01:25:24,840 --> 01:25:26,680
Why are you yelling at me?

2189
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:27,440
I'm sorry.

2190
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:28,880
Wait, she has a car now.

2191
01:25:29,120 --> 01:25:30,520
Look at that car she has.

2192
01:25:31,380 --> 01:25:32,040
Heck yeah.

2193
01:25:32,220 --> 01:25:33,840
Guys, go to college with me.

2194
01:25:33,880 --> 01:25:34,260
Come on.

2195
01:25:34,580 --> 01:25:36,720
Okay, I'm gonna go to college.

2196
01:25:38,120 --> 01:25:38,600
Alright.

2197
01:25:39,460 --> 01:25:40,520
We can join a...

2198
01:25:40,520 --> 01:25:41,120
What's it called?

2199
01:25:41,300 --> 01:25:42,160
A sorority.

2200
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:43,220
Oh yeah!

2201
01:25:43,580 --> 01:25:45,080
Frat house.

2202
01:25:45,280 --> 01:25:47,700
Have you guys seen those sorority welcome videos?

2203
01:25:47,800 --> 01:25:50,540
Where they made it like a welcome to hell.

2204
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:53,320
That's crazy.

2205
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:53,380
Yeah, yeah.

2206
01:25:54,680 --> 01:25:55,680
She's crazy.

2207
01:25:56,420 --> 01:25:58,280
And then they make it a final boss.

2208
01:25:59,180 --> 01:25:59,520
Oh.

2209
01:25:59,940 --> 01:26:04,540
Oh, you get to order takeout or another board game battle.

2210
01:26:05,300 --> 01:26:05,320
Oh.

2211
01:26:06,860 --> 01:26:07,860
100,000.

2212
01:26:08,740 --> 01:26:11,280
You wanna challenge me to a board game battle?

2213
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:12,800
We're already fighting each other?

2214
01:26:13,280 --> 01:26:15,620
I have not rolled less than an 8 on these mini games.

2215
01:26:15,820 --> 01:26:16,860
I have not rolled less than an 8.

2216
01:26:17,260 --> 01:26:20,160
I remember you fought me once and then you lost.

2217
01:26:20,680 --> 01:26:21,860
Yeah, but I rolled an 8.

2218
01:26:22,700 --> 01:26:24,020
You rolled a 3.

2219
01:26:25,480 --> 01:26:26,400
I rolled an 8.

2220
01:26:27,340 --> 01:26:27,640
Thank you.

2221
01:26:27,680 --> 01:26:27,960
There you go.

2222
01:26:28,080 --> 01:26:28,460
See, watch.

2223
01:26:28,580 --> 01:26:29,280
Bam, easy.

2224
01:26:29,620 --> 01:26:30,400
Close enough.

2225
01:26:33,460 --> 01:26:34,700
Pick your time.

2226
01:26:35,060 --> 01:26:36,580
Hey look, I love one.

2227
01:26:38,920 --> 01:26:40,940
Bow, don't you wanna be one with me?

2228
01:26:41,020 --> 01:26:42,460
We could get third place together.

2229
01:26:43,820 --> 01:26:44,700
Oh gosh.

2230
01:26:45,320 --> 01:26:46,300
Barely made it.

2231
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:48,280
How do I get fourth?

2232
01:26:48,780 --> 01:26:49,740
I always win.

2233
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:51,580
How do I get fourth?

2234
01:26:52,140 --> 01:26:53,400
Guys, guys, what are the secrets?

2235
01:26:53,740 --> 01:26:56,320
Put my camera back on your stream and we'll see what my secret is.

2236
01:26:56,500 --> 01:26:57,380
We made it.

2237
01:26:57,480 --> 01:26:59,360
Put it back on your stream and we'll see what my secret is, okay?

2238
01:26:59,580 --> 01:27:01,580
Alright, let me know when you did it.

2239
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:02,500
I did it.

2240
01:27:03,320 --> 01:27:04,020
What do you see?

2241
01:27:05,020 --> 01:27:05,820
I did it.

2242
01:27:05,900 --> 01:27:06,540
What should I say?

2243
01:27:06,900 --> 01:27:08,680
You never requested me to say it.

2244
01:27:09,260 --> 01:27:09,900
I see you.

2245
01:27:10,500 --> 01:27:11,260
What am I doing?

2246
01:27:11,260 --> 01:27:12,460
I see you.

2247
01:27:12,500 --> 01:27:13,320
What am I doing?

2248
01:27:13,700 --> 01:27:14,880
You're being cute.

2249
01:27:18,440 --> 01:27:19,540
Okay, I'll stop.

2250
01:27:19,660 --> 01:27:19,900
Fine.

2251
01:27:21,160 --> 01:27:23,020
It's hard to freaking do it.

2252
01:27:23,580 --> 01:27:25,140
She's strong.

2253
01:27:28,500 --> 01:27:29,740
You could be a fairy.

2254
01:27:30,580 --> 01:27:31,580
I could be a fairy?

2255
01:27:32,140 --> 01:27:34,320
You're so small, Fillion.

2256
01:27:34,580 --> 01:27:35,560
Fillion, what are you doing?

2257
01:27:35,560 --> 01:27:36,980
You're just standing there.

2258
01:27:36,980 --> 01:27:37,680
A furry?

2259
01:27:38,600 --> 01:27:40,140
What's the song from Peter Pan?

2260
01:27:42,460 --> 01:27:42,940
Neverland?

2261
01:27:44,260 --> 01:27:45,380
No, that's not.

2262
01:27:45,520 --> 01:27:46,140
No, that's not.

2263
01:27:48,340 --> 01:27:50,440
I don't think people remember any songs from...

2264
01:27:50,440 --> 01:27:51,480
She was a fairy.

2265
01:27:51,940 --> 01:27:53,120
She was a fairy.

2266
01:27:53,720 --> 01:27:55,100
Alright, I'm gonna become a fairy when I grow up.

2267
01:27:55,140 --> 01:27:58,500
If you steal my job, I'm actually blacklisting you from my entire life.

2268
01:27:59,120 --> 01:28:01,580
You have to attack this as a fairy?

2269
01:28:02,200 --> 01:28:02,540
Yes.

2270
01:28:02,640 --> 01:28:04,480
Who established the government here?

2271
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:08,840
The king did.

2272
01:28:09,500 --> 01:28:11,620
Also, just so you guys know, 8 is my favorite number IRL.

2273
01:28:12,740 --> 01:28:16,460
How does the king control the rights for fairies?

2274
01:28:19,040 --> 01:28:20,620
Okay, guys, I'm a fairy.

2275
01:28:20,760 --> 01:28:22,060
I move one square per turn.

2276
01:28:22,640 --> 01:28:23,320
Oh, guitar lessons.

2277
01:28:23,400 --> 01:28:24,000
You should.

2278
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:27,140
You can play like a tiny guitar.

2279
01:28:31,420 --> 01:28:33,780
It's not a guitar, it's a ukulele.

2280
01:28:33,780 --> 01:28:37,500
Well, it is a kingdom, like Doobie said, so a king lives there.

2281
01:28:37,620 --> 01:28:40,380
We should start a rebellion, like the French.

2282
01:28:41,640 --> 01:28:42,260
Let's do it.

2283
01:28:42,660 --> 01:28:47,900
A tower guard gets paid less than a fairy?

2284
01:28:47,960 --> 01:28:49,560
What the fuck does a fairy do?

2285
01:28:49,980 --> 01:28:55,300
What the fuck does a fairy do?

2286
01:28:57,380 --> 01:29:01,140
I get paid 10k less than a fairy.

2287
01:29:01,140 --> 01:29:03,720
Bro, all you do is stand in front of a doorway.

2288
01:29:03,940 --> 01:29:05,560
What the fuck does a fairy do for the people?

2289
01:29:06,160 --> 01:29:08,540
I am doing my Tinker Girl C, you know what I'm saying?

2290
01:29:09,480 --> 01:29:13,860
Yo, okay, listen, Doobie, when you're a fairy, are you not out there tinkering your bell?

2291
01:29:14,100 --> 01:29:16,360
What are you saying?

2292
01:29:17,140 --> 01:29:18,600
Because I value her opinions.

2293
01:29:19,040 --> 01:29:19,980
Leave her alone!

2294
01:29:21,220 --> 01:29:22,540
I don't know what you mean by that.

2295
01:29:22,920 --> 01:29:24,660
Are you out there tinkering your bell as a fairy?

2296
01:29:24,740 --> 01:29:26,620
You need to leave us alone!

2297
01:29:26,620 --> 01:29:30,520
You're like the Na'vi.

2298
01:29:31,740 --> 01:29:33,080
Hey, Link, listen!

2299
01:29:34,920 --> 01:29:37,420
Anyone got a fly swatter around here?

2300
01:29:38,320 --> 01:29:41,140
Did you guys know I'm attracted to electricity?

2301
01:29:44,700 --> 01:29:46,180
You're like an electric fairy?

2302
01:29:46,840 --> 01:29:48,460
Yeah, I'm like an electric type Pokemon.

2303
01:29:49,060 --> 01:29:50,720
Oh, bowling duel.

2304
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:52,860
Bell, what do you say?

2305
01:29:53,360 --> 01:29:58,240
There's no way a fairy loses a bowling duel or wins because I'm like four inches tall on a good day.

2306
01:29:59,200 --> 01:29:59,600
Fine.

2307
01:30:01,080 --> 01:30:01,480
Yeah!

2308
01:30:02,660 --> 01:30:03,840
Put her in the jar!

2309
01:30:07,380 --> 01:30:08,820
Wait, Bell, check this one out.

2310
01:30:10,060 --> 01:30:10,860
Alright, alright.

2311
01:30:12,220 --> 01:30:12,840
Oh, what is it?

2312
01:30:15,380 --> 01:30:17,440
You got fucking finessed.

2313
01:30:17,940 --> 01:30:19,780
This is why you don't make deals with fairies.

2314
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:19,920
What the heck?

2315
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:20,300
I won!

2316
01:30:21,220 --> 01:30:22,680
You wonder what a fairy do?

2317
01:30:22,680 --> 01:30:24,280
A fairy is a real hustler.

2318
01:30:24,500 --> 01:30:26,300
Yeah, I know you're a scam artist.

2319
01:30:27,220 --> 01:30:29,040
Yeah, and I'm also rich right now.

2320
01:30:29,260 --> 01:30:30,640
Listen, I ain't even gonna call it I'm rich.

2321
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:31,920
We gotta fucking...

2322
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:33,420
We gotta put her in the jar, guys.

2323
01:30:33,540 --> 01:30:35,120
You know I'm gonna get a jar for this, Koogi.

2324
01:30:35,580 --> 01:30:38,600
I'm gonna get a jar for you now.

2325
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:40,000
Just cause you said that.

2326
01:30:41,960 --> 01:30:43,060
Fairies go in jars.

2327
01:30:43,680 --> 01:30:45,700
Exactly, that's how we...

2328
01:30:45,700 --> 01:30:47,820
It's like trolls.

2329
01:30:48,180 --> 01:30:50,220
We put the trolls in a jar and then eat it.

2330
01:30:51,360 --> 01:30:53,080
Woah, I'm gonna be a mage.

2331
01:30:53,420 --> 01:30:54,020
Oh, a mage.

2332
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:54,780
That's kinda sick, actually.

2333
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,140
Cast spells and stuff.

2334
01:30:57,460 --> 01:30:58,300
That's actually kinda sick.

2335
01:30:58,420 --> 01:30:58,780
What the frick?

2336
01:30:59,500 --> 01:31:01,760
Yeah, I mean...

2337
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:04,280
She went to college for that.

2338
01:31:04,420 --> 01:31:05,640
She went to magic school.

2339
01:31:05,880 --> 01:31:06,500
Koogi, I'm so sorry.

2340
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:07,340
I'll give you your money back.

2341
01:31:08,360 --> 01:31:08,620
Alright.

2342
01:31:09,900 --> 01:31:11,440
Don't put me into a napping bird.

2343
01:31:11,640 --> 01:31:13,480
I'm gonna put you in a fucking jar.

2344
01:31:14,020 --> 01:31:14,940
Can you polymorph me?

2345
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:15,900
What spells do you know?

2346
01:31:15,900 --> 01:31:18,620
Why are you still trying to put me in a jar?

2347
01:31:18,740 --> 01:31:19,560
You're a town guard.

2348
01:31:19,720 --> 01:31:20,400
Go defend something.

2349
01:31:20,600 --> 01:31:22,120
I didn't go...

2350
01:31:22,120 --> 01:31:23,440
I'm not a guard.

2351
01:31:23,560 --> 01:31:24,420
That's the thing.

2352
01:31:24,560 --> 01:31:25,340
Then what's your job?

2353
01:31:25,680 --> 01:31:26,780
I'm an oracle.

2354
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:27,920
I can predict the future.

2355
01:31:28,040 --> 01:31:29,320
Oh, so now you're a professional scam artist.

2356
01:31:29,500 --> 01:31:31,300
No, I'm literally...

2357
01:31:31,300 --> 01:31:32,680
I'm literally an oracle.

2358
01:31:33,720 --> 01:31:35,440
Here, I cast a spell.

2359
01:31:35,740 --> 01:31:37,040
You can spin again.

2360
01:31:37,500 --> 01:31:38,240
Oh, thank you.

2361
01:31:38,320 --> 01:31:38,480
Okay.

2362
01:31:38,920 --> 01:31:41,160
Yeah, you wanna get a really low number like golf.

2363
01:31:41,860 --> 01:31:42,620
Okay, I'll see you later.

2364
01:31:42,620 --> 01:31:45,280
Doki, I'm gonna do your job for you, okay?

2365
01:31:45,460 --> 01:31:45,860
Here we go.

2366
01:31:46,620 --> 01:31:49,380
Is her job fake vaporware?

2367
01:31:50,760 --> 01:31:52,160
What the fuck is that?

2368
01:31:56,100 --> 01:31:57,560
That's really embarrassing, honestly.

2369
01:31:57,560 --> 01:31:58,960
Yeah, that's pretty embarrassing.

2370
01:31:59,640 --> 01:32:01,680
Watch me roll a low number for Doopie.

2371
01:32:01,940 --> 01:32:03,360
That's pretty embarrassing right there.

2372
01:32:03,880 --> 01:32:04,820
I don't really have words.

2373
01:32:06,380 --> 01:32:06,980
I failed you.

2374
01:32:08,420 --> 01:32:09,680
If you think about it...

2375
01:32:09,680 --> 01:32:11,680
Six is an upside-down nine, which is still pretty good.

2376
01:32:11,680 --> 01:32:12,060
There we go.

2377
01:32:12,520 --> 01:32:13,180
You know what?

2378
01:32:13,280 --> 01:32:15,440
I think you fit right in now on my stream.

2379
01:32:16,440 --> 01:32:16,840
Why?

2380
01:32:18,120 --> 01:32:18,980
Oh, I don't know.

2381
01:32:19,140 --> 01:32:19,740
What did you do to me?

2382
01:32:20,300 --> 01:32:22,180
Maybe you should pull up my stream and see.

2383
01:32:22,780 --> 01:32:24,240
Okay, maybe you should put a girl on.

2384
01:32:25,220 --> 01:32:26,180
Yeah, I rolled a three.

2385
01:32:27,620 --> 01:32:29,500
One, two, three...

2386
01:32:29,500 --> 01:32:31,680
Okay, I'm gonna go pull...

2387
01:32:32,580 --> 01:32:33,340
Cart race?

2388
01:32:33,580 --> 01:32:34,600
Or upgrade my PC?

2389
01:32:35,220 --> 01:32:36,000
PC, baby.

2390
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:36,720
Okay.

2391
01:32:38,900 --> 01:32:39,500
Take it.

2392
01:32:39,580 --> 01:32:39,840
I will.

2393
01:32:40,020 --> 01:32:40,680
I don't think I won't.

2394
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:42,120
Oh, you have the most wealth now.

2395
01:32:42,760 --> 01:32:43,740
You're so wealthy.

2396
01:32:44,760 --> 01:32:45,840
What did you do to me?

2397
01:32:47,160 --> 01:32:48,000
Are you on YouTube?

2398
01:32:48,560 --> 01:32:49,340
What do you mean?

2399
01:32:49,720 --> 01:32:50,740
Where are you?

2400
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:54,560
What do you mean?

2401
01:32:54,760 --> 01:32:55,800
Where do you stream?

2402
01:32:56,940 --> 01:32:59,940
If you're asking that now, I'm not telling you.

2403
01:33:00,340 --> 01:33:01,500
I'm gonna Google it.

2404
01:33:01,760 --> 01:33:02,560
I found you.

2405
01:33:03,620 --> 01:33:04,880
You made your stream title.

2406
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:05,820
I'm gonna do...

2407
01:33:05,820 --> 01:33:06,700
G4 Gore.

2408
01:33:08,040 --> 01:33:09,480
What did you do to me?

2409
01:33:12,340 --> 01:33:13,300
G4 Gore.

2410
01:33:13,700 --> 01:33:14,720
G4 Gore.

2411
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:17,540
You're gonna run out of air in there.

2412
01:33:18,080 --> 01:33:19,520
There's no air holes.

2413
01:33:20,100 --> 01:33:20,700
Can you see this?

2414
01:33:21,120 --> 01:33:22,500
I'm gonna start a family.

2415
01:33:22,640 --> 01:33:23,060
Let's go.

2416
01:33:23,420 --> 01:33:24,920
I want you guys to pay 20k.

2417
01:33:27,120 --> 01:33:29,120
I'm gonna make sure you guys...

2418
01:33:29,120 --> 01:33:30,260
No, not taxes!

2419
01:33:32,160 --> 01:33:33,200
Can't escape.

2420
01:33:33,420 --> 01:33:34,840
Not even in fairytale.

2421
01:33:34,840 --> 01:33:36,280
Not even in fairytale.

2422
01:33:36,420 --> 01:33:38,740
And I have to pay taxes.

2423
01:33:42,080 --> 01:33:45,360
I made sure there's no air holes in here.

2424
01:33:46,720 --> 01:33:50,840
Sorry, little guy.

2425
01:33:51,020 --> 01:33:51,600
Sorry, fairy.

2426
01:33:57,520 --> 01:33:58,900
What is this?

2427
01:33:58,900 --> 01:34:00,040
I just poured water.

2428
01:34:00,360 --> 01:34:01,540
Where did she get water?

2429
01:34:01,880 --> 01:34:04,160
Where did she get water in the jar?

2430
01:34:09,020 --> 01:34:10,940
Where did the water come from?

2431
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,040
It was empty when I put her in the jar.

2432
01:34:22,260 --> 01:34:23,320
You can be a mage!

2433
01:34:23,320 --> 01:34:25,420
If your name is Smith, then what are you?

2434
01:34:26,220 --> 01:34:27,220
I'm gonna be a mage.

2435
01:34:27,340 --> 01:34:28,760
Wait, isn't Anubia a mage too?

2436
01:34:30,800 --> 01:34:32,080
Oh my god!

2437
01:34:32,580 --> 01:34:33,560
Who's the better mage?

2438
01:34:35,260 --> 01:34:37,360
Oh, thanks for the money.

2439
01:34:37,640 --> 01:34:38,860
I have no money!

2440
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:39,820
Why am I poor?

2441
01:34:41,200 --> 01:34:43,320
She went to a fortune teller.

2442
01:34:44,160 --> 01:34:46,940
Oh, another laser tag.

2443
01:34:47,780 --> 01:34:48,400
Let's do it.

2444
01:34:48,480 --> 01:34:49,320
Chat, I'm a fairy.

2445
01:34:50,160 --> 01:34:50,560
Yes!

2446
01:34:52,660 --> 01:34:54,580
Oh my god, that's not fair!

2447
01:34:54,980 --> 01:34:55,360
You're a mage!

2448
01:34:57,920 --> 01:34:58,320
No.

2449
01:35:00,520 --> 01:35:04,120
No, I bet it's if the other person has to agree to it.

2450
01:35:04,180 --> 01:35:04,840
I don't agree.

2451
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:06,100
I'd rather keep you in the jar.

2452
01:35:11,260 --> 01:35:12,600
How about a good deal?

2453
01:35:13,140 --> 01:35:14,060
That is a good deal.

2454
01:35:15,840 --> 01:35:17,580
If I win, you take me out of the jar.

2455
01:35:17,580 --> 01:35:19,920
Yeah, and if I win, you put yourself in the jar.

2456
01:35:20,060 --> 01:35:20,780
On stream.

2457
01:35:21,380 --> 01:35:22,180
It's a deal.

2458
01:35:22,220 --> 01:35:24,620
Mom, prepare a jar JPEG if I need one.

2459
01:35:26,080 --> 01:35:28,040
She doesn't even believe in herself.

2460
01:35:28,160 --> 01:35:30,200
She told her mom to get that ready.

2461
01:35:30,520 --> 01:35:33,800
If you believe in yourself, you wouldn't even...

2462
01:35:35,580 --> 01:35:37,840
I've had the worst luck in these though.

2463
01:35:38,220 --> 01:35:39,920
I've had the worst luck in these.

2464
01:35:40,020 --> 01:35:41,540

2465
01:35:42,300 --> 01:35:42,920

Alright, I put you out of the jar.

You know, I just miss on the best joke of all time because I won.

2468
01:35:51,280 --> 01:35:52,660

01:35:54,340 --> 01:36:00,000
Yeah, but do you really want to lose out on content?

2470
01:36:01,840 --> 01:36:02,940
Yeah, but do you really want to lose out on content?

2471
01:36:03,620 --> 01:36:05,980

2976
02:20:43,730 --> 02:20:44,230
You know what?

2977
02:20:44,370 --> 02:20:45,090
I'm gonna risk it.

2978
02:20:45,230 --> 02:20:46,270
It's time to get a new job.

2979
02:20:46,530 --> 02:20:47,850
I know I just became a chef.

2980
02:20:47,850 --> 02:20:51,610
I just became a chef, but I feel like...

2981
02:20:51,610 --> 02:20:53,990
I feel like I need something new.

2982
02:20:54,170 --> 02:20:55,570
I realized I got the wrong degree.

2983
02:20:56,750 --> 02:20:57,810
Oh my god, you know what?

2984
02:20:58,130 --> 02:20:58,970
It's less money.

2985
02:21:05,660 --> 02:21:07,180
It's like 20k less.

2986
02:21:07,240 --> 02:21:07,720
It's fine.

2987
02:21:08,460 --> 02:21:09,640
The game in charge...

2988
02:21:09,640 --> 02:21:11,160
What game are you gonna be in charge of?

2989
02:21:12,360 --> 02:21:14,780
I'm gonna be in charge of...

2990
02:21:14,780 --> 02:21:15,700
Let's see...

2991
02:21:15,700 --> 02:21:16,940
The crypto game we were talking about?

2992
02:21:17,060 --> 02:21:18,560
Yeah, we gotta get a good game.

2993
02:21:18,560 --> 02:21:20,060
I'm gonna be in charge of Lethal Company.

2994
02:21:20,260 --> 02:21:21,340
That game is still good.

2995
02:21:21,740 --> 02:21:22,060
Right?

2996
02:21:23,660 --> 02:21:24,460
Okay, wait.

2997
02:21:24,660 --> 02:21:25,360
Doki, hear me out.

2998
02:21:25,480 --> 02:21:27,280
So you direct the game.

2999
02:21:27,640 --> 02:21:29,700
I'll direct the movie adaptation.

3000
02:21:30,220 --> 02:21:31,540
We'll make a billion dollars.

3001
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:32,620
And then...

3002
02:21:32,620 --> 02:21:33,240
What is...

3003
02:21:33,240 --> 02:21:34,360
Oh, these guys don't have jobs yet.

3004
02:21:34,400 --> 02:21:36,040
We'll put them in the lead actor roles.

3005
02:21:38,880 --> 02:21:39,620
Oh, Ryan Reynolds.

3006
02:21:39,940 --> 02:21:40,980
We gotta get Ryan Reynolds.

3007
02:21:41,340 --> 02:21:42,460
We should get Ryan Reynolds.

3008
02:21:42,700 --> 02:21:43,580
Yeah, Ryan Reynolds.

3009
02:21:43,800 --> 02:21:44,040
Yeah.

3010
02:21:44,820 --> 02:21:45,460
Isn't that...

3011
02:21:45,460 --> 02:21:47,100
Dude, we gotta have a word on this, Joan.

3012
02:21:47,100 --> 02:21:48,580
We gotta get Ryan Reynolds.

3013
02:21:48,880 --> 02:21:51,140
And then, we also have to counterbalance Ryan Reynolds.

3014
02:21:51,240 --> 02:21:52,120
So we'll get The Rock.

3015
02:21:52,600 --> 02:21:53,800
And then, we'll get...

3016
02:21:53,800 --> 02:21:54,380
We'll count...

3017
02:21:54,380 --> 02:21:55,440
And then, so like...

3018
02:21:55,440 --> 02:21:56,540
Wait, we don't have money.

3019
02:21:56,680 --> 02:21:57,740
Doobie needs loans.

3020
02:21:58,920 --> 02:22:01,120
Doobie, I'm so sorry.

3021
02:22:01,200 --> 02:22:02,620
It's too real now.

3022
02:22:02,760 --> 02:22:03,600
Oh, and she has to take another loan.

3023
02:22:03,600 --> 02:22:03,840
No, it's fine.

3024
02:22:03,900 --> 02:22:05,300
I know you gotta step on somebody.

3025
02:22:05,420 --> 02:22:06,360
Didn't climb the ladder.

3026
02:22:06,560 --> 02:22:07,260
It's fine.

3027
02:22:08,160 --> 02:22:10,900
No, it...

3028
02:22:10,900 --> 02:22:12,040
Don't worry about it.

3029
02:22:12,320 --> 02:22:12,920
Oh, my God.

3030
02:22:12,920 --> 02:22:13,920
You haven't graduated college yet?

3031
02:22:13,920 --> 02:22:17,080
She truly is just like...

3032
02:22:17,720 --> 02:22:18,140
Yeah.

3033
02:22:18,700 --> 02:22:20,440
It's time to throw a really good party.

3034
02:22:22,120 --> 02:22:24,060
And you even went to her party.

3035
02:22:24,240 --> 02:22:26,900
You went to her party and took her money.

3036
02:22:27,660 --> 02:22:28,080
That's...

3037
02:22:28,080 --> 02:22:29,200
Bro, it's not my fault.

3038
02:22:29,260 --> 02:22:31,440
She bet me $100,000 on a bowling game.

3039
02:22:31,460 --> 02:22:32,600
Oh, but you can be an engineer.

3040
02:22:34,800 --> 02:22:36,480
You can make battle bots.

3041
02:22:37,840 --> 02:22:39,140
Dude, don't be a battle bot.

3042
02:22:40,260 --> 02:22:41,420
My life's turning around.

3043
02:22:41,540 --> 02:22:42,100
Let's go.

3044
02:22:42,260 --> 02:22:43,100
Oh, my God.

3045
02:22:43,480 --> 02:22:44,240
It is.

3046
02:22:44,480 --> 02:22:44,620
Look at that.

3047
02:22:44,640 --> 02:22:45,580
You set up drones.

3048
02:22:48,080 --> 02:22:48,820
I'm free.

3049
02:22:49,040 --> 02:22:50,260
Oh, I can go to her party.

3050
02:22:50,300 --> 02:22:50,720
Watch me.

3051
02:22:50,920 --> 02:22:52,180
I can go to her party.

3052
02:22:52,760 --> 02:22:53,520
Go party.

3053
02:22:54,300 --> 02:22:54,320
Go party.

3054
02:22:54,320 --> 02:22:54,840
Go party.

3055
02:22:54,840 --> 02:22:55,200
Go party.

3056
02:22:55,460 --> 02:22:56,000
Go party.

3057
02:22:56,500 --> 02:22:58,980
You have such good connections like old times.

3058
02:22:59,220 --> 02:22:59,620
Yeah, dude.

3059
02:22:59,620 --> 02:23:02,160
You remember the good old days when you threw that party?

3060
02:23:02,300 --> 02:23:03,080
That was so fun.

3061
02:23:03,100 --> 02:23:03,900
Oh, that was such a good party.

3062
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:04,460
You gotta...

3063
02:23:04,460 --> 02:23:05,080
I'll do it again.

3064
02:23:07,760 --> 02:23:09,400
You're gonna have a realistic party.

3065
02:23:10,380 --> 02:23:13,320
All I'm saying is ever since that party, your life turned around.

3066
02:23:14,820 --> 02:23:17,980
Now that my life's turned around, I'm gonna throw another party.

3067
02:23:20,120 --> 02:23:22,700
Now that I don't want anything until I hit rock bottom.

3068
02:23:24,700 --> 02:23:26,060
Sorry for party rocking.

3069
02:23:27,560 --> 02:23:28,280
I'm an addiction.

3070
02:23:28,280 --> 02:23:30,120
I feel like the AI's gonna move for you.

3071
02:23:33,080 --> 02:23:34,900
To be honest, the AI plays better than I do.

3072
02:23:36,480 --> 02:23:37,020
Who's that?

3073
02:23:37,120 --> 02:23:37,800
Oh, my God.

3074
02:23:38,080 --> 02:23:38,320
See?

3075
02:23:38,460 --> 02:23:39,820
Doobie, I panned you back.

3076
02:23:39,920 --> 02:23:41,180
You know, I only owe you 50k now.

3077
02:23:41,340 --> 02:23:41,480
See?

3078
02:23:41,560 --> 02:23:42,320
All part of the plan.

3079
02:23:43,140 --> 02:23:43,740
Thank you.

3080
02:23:44,140 --> 02:23:44,700
Ran you over.

3081
02:23:46,380 --> 02:23:48,380
Ain't no party like a Doobie party.

3082
02:23:48,660 --> 02:23:49,780
Yeah, man.

3083
02:23:50,160 --> 02:23:53,160
What the fuck is 100k for takeout?

3084
02:23:53,260 --> 02:23:55,160
This better be like some Michelin star shit.

3085
02:23:55,760 --> 02:23:56,940
Yeah, it's Gordon Ramsay.

3086
02:23:57,980 --> 02:24:00,240
You pay him to fucking cook in your kitchen.

3087
02:24:03,600 --> 02:24:04,120
20k.

3088
02:24:05,160 --> 02:24:05,680
Nice.

3089
02:24:06,040 --> 02:24:07,220
Nice 20k.

3090
02:24:07,980 --> 02:24:10,640
Why did I get one fourth of my payment for the lawn mowing?

3091
02:24:11,660 --> 02:24:13,440
You just didn't do a good job.

3092
02:24:13,440 --> 02:24:15,700
That's a lot of patches.

3093
02:24:16,080 --> 02:24:16,400
Yeah.

3094
02:24:16,740 --> 02:24:17,460
Oh, what is that?

3095
02:24:17,740 --> 02:24:18,240
It's fate.

3096
02:24:18,400 --> 02:24:19,700
So I can get taxed again.

3097
02:24:20,020 --> 02:24:20,560
Oh, phantom.

3098
02:24:21,420 --> 02:24:22,040
Oh, thank God.

3099
02:24:22,340 --> 02:24:24,080
Thank God.

3100
02:24:24,200 --> 02:24:25,540
Yeah, but can I afford it?

3101
02:24:26,540 --> 02:24:27,660
Can I afford it?

3102
02:24:28,180 --> 02:24:29,880
Oh, I could take a loan.

3103
02:24:30,840 --> 02:24:31,260
You know what?

3104
02:24:31,300 --> 02:24:32,200
It'll be worth it.

3105
02:24:32,320 --> 02:24:33,480
It'll be so worth it.

3106
02:24:33,740 --> 02:24:34,680
Look at the max price.

3107
02:24:35,040 --> 02:24:35,460
I know.

3108
02:24:35,600 --> 02:24:35,860
I know.

3109
02:24:35,900 --> 02:24:36,600
I'm gonna take a loan.

3110
02:24:37,240 --> 02:24:39,600
You borrow money from the bank and you pay him back slowly.

3111
02:24:39,880 --> 02:24:40,280
Exactly.

3112
02:24:41,320 --> 02:24:42,320
I'm getting a mortgage.

3113
02:24:42,320 --> 02:24:43,100
Yeah, yeah.

3114
02:24:43,140 --> 02:24:43,860
I'm getting a mortgage.

3115
02:24:43,980 --> 02:24:44,460
It's fine.

3116
02:24:44,680 --> 02:24:45,480
Is there interest?

3117
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:46,340
Yes.

3118
02:24:48,160 --> 02:24:48,900
It's okay.

3119
02:24:49,100 --> 02:24:49,400
It's okay.

3120
02:24:49,420 --> 02:24:50,600
I'm mortgaging my house.

3121
02:24:50,820 --> 02:24:51,700
She's mortgaging?

3122
02:24:51,860 --> 02:24:52,500
She's mortgaging?

3123
02:24:53,060 --> 02:24:53,600
I see.

3124
02:24:54,260 --> 02:24:55,320
It's so worth it.

3125
02:24:55,920 --> 02:24:56,500
It's fine.

3126
02:24:56,660 --> 02:24:58,720
If Doobie can be in debt, so can I.

3127
02:25:00,120 --> 02:25:00,940
Take a loan.

3128
02:25:01,840 --> 02:25:02,880
Take a loan off.

3129
02:25:03,080 --> 02:25:03,580
It's fine.

3130
02:25:07,920 --> 02:25:09,260
Just like life.

3131
02:25:10,220 --> 02:25:10,700
Yeah!

3132
02:25:12,600 --> 02:25:13,160
You almost got out of college.

3133
02:25:13,160 --> 02:25:14,520
I guess I'll just always get money.

3134
02:25:14,900 --> 02:25:16,180
Wait, are you still in college?

3135
02:25:16,980 --> 02:25:18,060
I think so.

3136
02:25:18,200 --> 02:25:18,440
Are you...

3137
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:20,200
Instead of like...

3138
02:25:20,200 --> 02:25:20,940
Do you wanna slam dunk me?

3139
02:25:21,080 --> 02:25:23,120
Instead of three years, you're in the six-year route.

3140
02:25:23,480 --> 02:25:24,500
I'll just do this.

3141
02:25:24,960 --> 02:25:25,360
Good bet.

3142
02:25:27,360 --> 02:25:28,760
Board game battle time.

3143
02:25:29,320 --> 02:25:29,780
Here we go.

3144
02:25:29,960 --> 02:25:30,280
Here we go.

3145
02:25:30,620 --> 02:25:30,980
Alright.

3146
02:25:31,480 --> 02:25:32,560
Someone beat my six.

3147
02:25:37,420 --> 02:25:38,380
Not Doobie.

3148
02:25:38,860 --> 02:25:41,280
Alright, it's Fillion's god roll time.

3149
02:25:41,520 --> 02:25:42,640
God roll time.

3150
02:25:42,900 --> 02:25:43,640
They called me.

3151
02:25:44,060 --> 02:25:44,540
No!

3152
02:25:44,740 --> 02:25:46,560
Stop copying my answers!

3153
02:25:47,120 --> 02:25:48,380
Oh, thank fucking god.

3154
02:25:49,120 --> 02:25:50,780
Look at that!

3155
02:25:51,520 --> 02:25:52,840
Paid off my debts!

3156
02:25:53,480 --> 02:25:53,900
No!

3157
02:25:55,580 --> 02:25:56,540
So easy.

3158
02:25:57,060 --> 02:25:58,400
How do you actually pay off your debt?

3159
02:25:58,480 --> 02:25:59,120
When does that happen?

3160
02:25:59,360 --> 02:26:00,540
I think it happens at the end.

3161
02:26:00,740 --> 02:26:01,460
I'm pretty sure.

3162
02:26:01,660 --> 02:26:02,960
Or like, your next turn.

3163
02:26:03,040 --> 02:26:04,380
If you have enough money for it.

3164
02:26:05,140 --> 02:26:05,940
I don't know.

3165
02:26:06,020 --> 02:26:07,480
I've never been in debt before.

3166
02:26:07,480 --> 02:26:08,480
In game.

3167
02:26:09,900 --> 02:26:10,740
In game?

3168
02:26:10,820 --> 02:26:11,320
In game.

3169
02:26:12,440 --> 02:26:13,380
In game!

3170
02:26:14,020 --> 02:26:18,980
To be fair, I went to a Canadian university, so I definitely haven't been in college debt.

3171
02:26:20,460 --> 02:26:21,640
Ain't that nice.

3172
02:26:22,080 --> 02:26:22,340
Stop!

3173
02:26:22,860 --> 02:26:23,220
Free?

3174
02:26:23,880 --> 02:26:25,900
Stay single or marry women?

3175
02:26:26,200 --> 02:26:30,420
If you get married, you can make everybody pay 20k.

3176
02:26:31,200 --> 02:26:31,940
That is true.

3177
02:26:32,480 --> 02:26:33,100
That is true.

3178
02:26:33,220 --> 02:26:34,220
And you can get out of debt again.

3179
02:26:34,220 --> 02:26:35,140
Okay, time to cheat the system.

3180
02:26:35,660 --> 02:26:36,100
Chat.

3181
02:26:36,100 --> 02:26:37,920
What should I do?

3182
02:26:38,280 --> 02:26:38,720
Shit.

3183
02:26:38,860 --> 02:26:39,400
Who did it?

3184
02:26:39,520 --> 02:26:40,160
Oh, it's Filian.

3185
02:26:40,600 --> 02:26:41,840
Why are you always paying?

3186
02:26:41,840 --> 02:26:42,300
You're robbing me!

3187
02:26:42,480 --> 02:26:43,940
Yeah, you're robbing her!

3188
02:26:44,500 --> 02:26:46,380
Bro, I still owe 100k!

3189
02:26:46,400 --> 02:26:46,860
Oh my god!

3190
02:26:49,080 --> 02:26:50,180
Oh my god!

3191
02:26:53,140 --> 02:26:55,260
I can't believe Doobie is dead.

3192
02:26:55,260 --> 02:26:56,140
I'm gonna die with debt.

3193
02:26:56,280 --> 02:26:58,660
I'm gonna owe 100k to my children.

3194
02:26:59,720 --> 02:27:01,280
Don't worry, maybe they'll send a check.

3195
02:27:01,440 --> 02:27:02,900
They'll send a severance check.

3196
02:27:02,900 --> 02:27:07,820
I think what the game meant by normal was exactly like real life.

3197
02:27:07,820 --> 02:27:09,100
Just say like real life!

3198
02:27:10,740 --> 02:27:12,340
Doobie, I'll put you in my movie, bro.

3199
02:27:12,540 --> 02:27:14,360
Maybe we shouldn't have gone to college.

3200
02:27:15,640 --> 02:27:18,060
Okay, yeah, I'll pay you 100k.

3201
02:27:18,220 --> 02:27:20,020
You're a film director, you should stay single.

3202
02:27:20,920 --> 02:27:21,980
Okay, I'll stay single.

3203
02:27:22,300 --> 02:27:23,620
Chat, should I stay single?

3204
02:27:24,180 --> 02:27:26,720
Just grind a bunch of money to buy Doobie's debt out?

3205
02:27:26,900 --> 02:27:27,580
What do you guys think?

3206
02:27:28,620 --> 02:27:29,900
Wait, didn't you put her in debt?

3207
02:27:30,080 --> 02:27:30,360
You're gonna buy me?

3208
02:27:30,360 --> 02:27:32,820
And then that way you can throw an even bigger party.

3209
02:27:33,080 --> 02:27:35,720
I'm dedicating my life to saving Doobie's life.

3210
02:27:35,720 --> 02:27:36,580
You know what I'm saying?

3211
02:27:36,700 --> 02:27:38,520
That's a good cause.

3212
02:27:38,660 --> 02:27:41,300
I'm giving a party so I'm not gonna waste it or anything.

3213
02:27:42,800 --> 02:27:44,540
The party life is behind her.

3214
02:27:44,860 --> 02:27:45,520
Are you sure?

3215
02:27:46,080 --> 02:27:48,940
You give her like an allowance and she just uses it.

3216
02:27:48,980 --> 02:27:50,040
Oh, you can get a job?

3217
02:27:50,200 --> 02:27:51,380
Get a promotion or...

3218
02:27:51,380 --> 02:27:54,160
Okay, Doobie, I know I said I'd put you in my movie, but I'm busy.

3219
02:27:54,560 --> 02:27:54,960
I'm sorry.

3220
02:27:56,160 --> 02:27:57,800
She's having a midlife crisis.

3221
02:27:57,800 --> 02:27:58,320
Party!

3222
02:27:58,700 --> 02:27:59,580
Okay, no, no, no.

3223
02:27:59,600 --> 02:28:00,680
Don't worry, I'll give you...

3224
02:28:00,680 --> 02:28:01,800
You can be...

3225
02:28:02,520 --> 02:28:04,360
Oh my god, video games or robotics?

3226
02:28:05,440 --> 02:28:06,320
Look at the money.

3227
02:28:06,840 --> 02:28:07,900
Chat, what do I do?

3228
02:28:07,940 --> 02:28:08,760
Do I do it for the money?

3229
02:28:09,680 --> 02:28:13,140
Well, Doobie became a robotics engineer and then she went into debt.

3230
02:28:13,260 --> 02:28:14,320
So, like, there's that.

3231
02:28:15,620 --> 02:28:16,540
Yeah, it's bad luck.

3232
02:28:17,780 --> 02:28:19,460
Doobie, I'll partner up with you.

3233
02:28:19,700 --> 02:28:21,940
We'll make a really sick, nasty cybertruck.

3234
02:28:22,340 --> 02:28:23,560
And then we'll take it over the planet.

3235
02:28:25,000 --> 02:28:25,400
Okay.

3236
02:28:26,180 --> 02:28:26,660
We'll do it.

3237
02:28:26,660 --> 02:28:27,180
We'll do it.

3238
02:28:27,260 --> 02:28:29,560
Oh my god, you guys are gonna make a real Transformers.

3239
02:28:29,620 --> 02:28:31,340
We're gonna make Megatron IRL.

3240
02:28:31,600 --> 02:28:32,900
Also, I gotta go pee, I'll be right back.

3241
02:28:33,700 --> 02:28:34,060
Megatron...

3242
02:28:34,880 --> 02:28:37,560
Actually, I said that, but Transformers aren't actually robots.

3243
02:28:37,900 --> 02:28:38,860
They're like...

3244
02:28:38,860 --> 02:28:40,540
They're actually, like, aliens.

3245
02:28:42,860 --> 02:28:44,520
Oh my god, I already paid 50k.

3246
02:28:48,920 --> 02:28:49,280
Alright.

3247
02:28:49,980 --> 02:28:52,360
I'm gonna get married so I can farm money.

3248
02:28:53,840 --> 02:28:54,460
Every year.

3249
02:28:54,460 --> 02:28:56,680
Is there any downside, really, to getting married?

3250
02:28:56,840 --> 02:28:57,600
I guess...

3251
02:28:59,080 --> 02:29:01,520
That's what the game wants to trick you into believing.

3252
02:29:01,900 --> 02:29:03,480
I have to pay taxes again.

3253
02:29:05,420 --> 02:29:06,500
Da piggy bank.

3254
02:29:06,700 --> 02:29:07,460
Got taxed.

3255
02:29:08,720 --> 02:29:10,800
I just get taxed.

3256
02:29:10,820 --> 02:29:12,300
Can I please finish college?

3257
02:29:12,760 --> 02:29:13,460
No way!

3258
02:29:13,720 --> 02:29:14,840
I'm still in college!

3259
02:29:15,320 --> 02:29:17,360
I literally have just finished.

3260
02:29:18,640 --> 02:29:20,380
Hey, maybe you have your doctorate now.

3261
02:29:20,760 --> 02:29:22,400
Oh, you'll be a chef!

3262
02:29:22,640 --> 02:29:23,420
I'll be a chef.

3263
02:29:23,420 --> 02:29:26,000
Maybe it's your passion versus mine.

3264
02:29:27,500 --> 02:29:29,540
I didn't like being a chef, but...

3265
02:29:29,540 --> 02:29:30,300
Oh, that's Billion.

3266
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:33,940
She's AFK and she's farming passively.

3267
02:29:34,720 --> 02:29:35,580
It's like farming.

3268
02:29:36,020 --> 02:29:37,620
You're never gonna finish this game.

3269
02:29:39,140 --> 02:29:39,560
It's okay.

3270
02:29:39,660 --> 02:29:40,780
Oh, wait, you get to keep...

3271
02:29:40,780 --> 02:29:41,440
Oh, wait, you're back!

3272
02:29:41,580 --> 02:29:42,680
Wait, you caught up!

3273
02:29:42,960 --> 02:29:43,380
I'm back!

3274
02:29:43,820 --> 02:29:44,300
Let's go.

3275
02:29:44,560 --> 02:29:45,500
Oh, Moe the Neighbor's Lawn.

3276
02:29:45,580 --> 02:29:46,300
Get that 80k.

3277
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:50,640
Is that one of the people you're known for?

3278
02:29:52,540 --> 02:29:53,420
Oh, seven.

3279
02:29:53,700 --> 02:29:55,480
Isn't someone you're known for using the bathroom quickly?

3280
02:29:56,280 --> 02:29:56,620
What?

3281
02:29:56,820 --> 02:29:57,760
What does that even mean?

3282
02:29:58,000 --> 02:29:58,440
Who's that?

3283
02:29:58,540 --> 02:29:59,280
Maybe the chat knows.

3284
02:29:59,460 --> 02:30:00,780
Maybe the chat knows, yeah.

3285
02:30:01,500 --> 02:30:01,880
Is that you?

3286
02:30:01,940 --> 02:30:03,120
I'm very fast at it, yes.

3287
02:30:03,120 --> 02:30:04,840
I'm gonna pay taxes for so long.

3288
02:30:04,880 --> 02:30:05,620
Do you have a race?

3289
02:30:06,360 --> 02:30:08,360
I don't think I want a race peeing.

3290
02:30:11,260 --> 02:30:12,560
You can do that.

3291
02:30:13,260 --> 02:30:14,420
It's competitive, it's competitive.

3292
02:30:15,340 --> 02:30:16,220
Competitive bathroom.

3293
02:30:17,560 --> 02:30:19,240
Alright, time to farm income.

3294
02:30:19,240 --> 02:30:19,900
We married!

3295
02:30:20,200 --> 02:30:20,600
Beautiful!

3296
02:30:21,220 --> 02:30:21,260
Yeah!

3297
02:30:21,600 --> 02:30:22,100
EL!

3298
02:30:24,060 --> 02:30:24,560
Alright.

3299
02:30:25,440 --> 02:30:25,740
Heart.

3300
02:30:27,280 --> 02:30:28,820
Oh, banana, oh.

3301
02:30:28,840 --> 02:30:30,280
It's time to spin to collect.

3302
02:30:31,900 --> 02:30:33,120
Oh, fuck, okay.

3303
02:30:34,720 --> 02:30:35,860
You guys like Pop-Tarts?

3304
02:30:38,520 --> 02:30:40,400
Yeah, I've never had a Pop-Tart before.

3305
02:30:40,600 --> 02:30:41,540
I do like Pop-Tarts.

3306
02:30:42,080 --> 02:30:43,240
Okay, what's your favorite Pop-Tart flavor?

3307
02:30:45,160 --> 02:30:46,480
I like the cinnamon one.

3308
02:30:47,020 --> 02:30:48,240
Ooh, okay.

3309
02:30:49,240 --> 02:30:52,780
Right now, I will say, if you haven't had a Pop-Tart, you're missing out big time.

3310
02:30:53,680 --> 02:30:54,160
Oh my God!

3311
02:30:54,540 --> 02:30:57,380
Your life is turning around ever since you got married!

3312
02:30:58,200 --> 02:30:59,420
Your husband is good luck!

3313
02:31:01,180 --> 02:31:02,240
You know what that means?

3314
02:31:02,380 --> 02:31:03,140
Another party.

3315
02:31:03,380 --> 02:31:04,500
Another party time.

3316
02:31:05,520 --> 02:31:07,100
Another day, another party.

3317
02:31:07,660 --> 02:31:09,240
Yeah, now you have...

3318
02:31:10,020 --> 02:31:11,580
Thank you.

3319
02:31:12,660 --> 02:31:15,120
Your number is 10, by the way.

3320
02:31:16,380 --> 02:31:17,200
I'll grab one.

3321
02:31:17,800 --> 02:31:18,560
Oh my God.

3322
02:31:18,560 --> 02:31:19,560
That's a number.

3323
02:31:20,240 --> 02:31:21,180
Here I am.

3324
02:31:21,560 --> 02:31:22,840
Can someone stop giving her money?

3325
02:31:23,920 --> 02:31:24,100
Anyone?

3326
02:31:24,440 --> 02:31:25,480
When will she pay taxes?

3327
02:31:26,280 --> 02:31:27,700
I think I've seen Philly and paid a tax.

3328
02:31:27,800 --> 02:31:31,280
I've never paid taxes once, and I've never owned a house once.

3329
02:31:31,580 --> 02:31:34,060
Therefore, I'm gonna get a house.

3330
02:31:34,980 --> 02:31:35,700
That's beautiful.

3331
02:31:36,480 --> 02:31:38,520
Forget the family chat, I'm all about the house.

3332
02:31:39,120 --> 02:31:39,540
Woohoo!

3333
02:31:39,780 --> 02:31:40,460
Yeah, baby!

3334
02:31:41,600 --> 02:31:42,420
I'm rich!

3335
02:31:42,940 --> 02:31:43,760
Okay, check me out.

3336
02:31:43,800 --> 02:31:44,380
Where's my house at?

3337
02:31:44,620 --> 02:31:45,300
Where's my house at?

3338
02:31:45,600 --> 02:31:46,400
Where's my house at?

3339
02:31:47,380 --> 02:31:48,220
Where's my house at?

3340
02:31:49,380 --> 02:31:49,820
Woohoo!

3341
02:31:51,240 --> 02:31:51,580
Okay.

3342
02:31:52,340 --> 02:31:53,000
What the heck?

3343
02:31:53,100 --> 02:31:54,420
I just got a job.

3344
02:31:54,900 --> 02:31:56,760
Boys, where are we moving in?

3345
02:31:57,980 --> 02:32:01,820
Boys, are we moving into a luxury apartment or a family?

3346
02:32:01,960 --> 02:32:02,540
Frick that family.

3347
02:32:02,860 --> 02:32:04,960
I'm gonna live in an Andrew Chang apartment.

3348
02:32:05,120 --> 02:32:07,300
I'm gonna say, like, you don't have a family.

3349
02:32:07,780 --> 02:32:09,120
Like, who's gonna live there?

3350
02:32:09,620 --> 02:32:09,880
Yeah.

3351
02:32:11,000 --> 02:32:13,000
This looks like a bachelor pad.

3352
02:32:13,620 --> 02:32:13,920
Exactly.

3353
02:32:13,940 --> 02:32:15,320
Why are you making me feel like Batman?

3354
02:32:16,110 --> 02:32:18,940
Wait, Batman at least has Catwoman.

3355
02:32:19,400 --> 02:32:21,520
I have a luxury apartment for Catwoman.

3356
02:32:22,560 --> 02:32:23,500
For what?

3357
02:32:24,260 --> 02:32:25,080
For yourself.

3358
02:32:25,220 --> 02:32:26,260
It's a bachelor pad.

3359
02:32:26,500 --> 02:32:27,660
You can be a passport, bro.

3360
02:32:28,080 --> 02:32:29,020
What's even the point?

3361
02:32:30,700 --> 02:32:31,540
Jacuzzi, true.

3362
02:32:31,720 --> 02:32:32,740
I'm... please.

3363
02:32:33,080 --> 02:32:33,780
Oh, it doesn't matter.

3364
02:32:33,860 --> 02:32:35,480
I was gonna stop anyway and get married.

3365
02:32:36,240 --> 02:32:37,320
Alright, women time.

3366
02:32:40,440 --> 02:32:42,100
Another day, another farm.

3367
02:32:42,100 --> 02:32:45,100
She loves me for me and not for my money because I don't have any.

3368
02:32:48,600 --> 02:32:50,440
At least now I know.

3369
02:32:52,400 --> 02:32:53,760
Oh, thank God.

3370
02:32:53,860 --> 02:32:55,020
Pay me 20k, everybody.

3371
02:32:55,440 --> 02:32:55,920
What?

3372
02:32:56,320 --> 02:32:57,440
Pay me 20k.

3373
02:32:58,420 --> 02:32:59,100
Please, I have...

3374
02:32:59,760 --> 02:33:01,020
Holy scam, bro.

3375
02:33:01,160 --> 02:33:03,720
Okay, well, guess that's your dead body right there.

3376
02:33:04,200 --> 02:33:07,740
I should never make any friends so that when they get married, I don't get taxed.

3377
02:33:08,040 --> 02:33:08,980
That's true.

3378
02:33:08,980 --> 02:33:11,740
I mean, you can literally not go to their weddings.

3379
02:33:12,140 --> 02:33:13,300
Don't go to their weddings.

3380
02:33:13,500 --> 02:33:15,380
You know what's the worst part?

3381
02:33:15,780 --> 02:33:17,380
And we still get taxed.

3382
02:33:17,620 --> 02:33:22,020
The worst part is destination weddings where they make you pay to go to a fucking country.

3383
02:33:22,620 --> 02:33:22,880
Yeah.

3384
02:33:23,120 --> 02:33:24,280
That's like a lot.

3385
02:33:24,620 --> 02:33:26,180
Yeah, there's like destination weddings.

3386
02:33:26,620 --> 02:33:28,320
You have to fly there and then...

3387
02:33:28,320 --> 02:33:32,820
It's basically a wedding where it's not in your country and you have to pay for your own flights.

3388
02:33:33,900 --> 02:33:35,540
Jesus Christ, why?

3389
02:33:36,020 --> 02:33:36,480
Exactly.

3390
02:33:36,980 --> 02:33:39,360
I've never been to a wedding in my life.

3391
02:33:41,140 --> 02:33:44,500
At best, you get like free food, but it's like, is it really worth it?

3392
02:33:45,920 --> 02:33:49,020
If they tell me their effing wedding is in China, I ain't going.

3393
02:33:50,840 --> 02:33:51,720
In fact...

3394
02:33:51,720 --> 02:33:53,820
I don't know, I'm just gonna delete their number.

3395
02:33:55,420 --> 02:33:56,500
I bet if you like...

3396
02:33:57,760 --> 02:33:58,640
Went to...

3397
02:33:58,640 --> 02:33:59,640
Can't you just like...

3398
02:34:01,880 --> 02:34:04,180
How do you save money having a wedding?

3399
02:34:04,240 --> 02:34:04,280
You don't.

3400
02:34:04,380 --> 02:34:05,280
You don't.

3401
02:34:05,280 --> 02:34:06,680
You could just have a courthouse wedding.

3402
02:34:07,640 --> 02:34:08,460
You don't.

3403
02:34:08,540 --> 02:34:09,540
You don't save money.

3404
02:34:09,720 --> 02:34:10,680
No, I don't wanna save money.

3405
02:34:10,840 --> 02:34:13,900
You marry Jeff Bezos, no prenup, then you break up with him.

3406
02:34:14,080 --> 02:34:17,040
I mean, that's what his ex-wife did.

3407
02:34:17,500 --> 02:34:17,900
Exactly.

3408
02:34:18,380 --> 02:34:21,440
Did you know like 8 of the top 10 richest women in the world are from divorces?

3409
02:34:22,340 --> 02:34:23,440
What am I doing wrong?

3410
02:34:23,460 --> 02:34:24,840
How do you know that fact?

3411
02:34:25,640 --> 02:34:28,160
Like, why are you even looking up that fact?

3412
02:34:28,540 --> 02:34:30,620
Were you trying to do something?

3413
02:34:31,040 --> 02:34:31,040
BALTAX!

3414
02:34:31,100 --> 02:34:32,300
RARE BALTAX!

3415
02:34:32,380 --> 02:34:34,620
Oh my god, the rare BALTAX, yeah.

3416
02:34:35,560 --> 02:34:36,940
Oh, we got a house!

3417
02:34:37,640 --> 02:34:40,600
Oh, what's her house gonna look like with under 130k?

3418
02:34:41,120 --> 02:34:41,400
Oh.

3419
02:34:42,460 --> 02:34:43,960
What are you gonna get, Doobie?

3420
02:34:44,140 --> 02:34:45,240
The family house!

3421
02:34:45,620 --> 02:34:46,560
With your family!

3422
02:34:47,060 --> 02:34:47,840
With your husband!

3423
02:34:48,700 --> 02:34:49,760
Your BL husband.

3424
02:34:50,500 --> 02:34:51,040
Her husband.

3425
02:34:53,000 --> 02:34:53,800
Out of money.

3426
02:34:58,020 --> 02:35:00,660
Not a loan would hurt you, Doobie.

3427
02:35:00,800 --> 02:35:02,340
Not a loan wouldn't hurt.

3428
02:35:02,820 --> 02:35:03,080
Yeah.

3429
02:35:03,080 --> 02:35:04,880
Wait, can everyone get married except for me?

3430
02:35:05,280 --> 02:35:05,580
Yeah.

3431
02:35:05,880 --> 02:35:06,720
I haven't gotten married.

3432
02:35:07,060 --> 02:35:07,500
Oh, okay.

3433
02:35:07,540 --> 02:35:08,500
Are you gonna get married, BAL?

3434
02:35:08,940 --> 02:35:09,860
I don't know.

3435
02:35:10,860 --> 02:35:11,140
Okay.

3436
02:35:12,160 --> 02:35:13,820
I will next time.

3437
02:35:14,560 --> 02:35:15,060
BALTAX!

3438
02:35:16,300 --> 02:35:16,800
BALTAX!

3439
02:35:16,900 --> 02:35:18,000
RARE BALTAX!

3440
02:35:18,800 --> 02:35:19,180
One!

3441
02:35:21,340 --> 02:35:21,840
Alright.

3442
02:35:22,840 --> 02:35:27,200
Oh, you get a second chance at love!

3443
02:35:28,120 --> 02:35:28,760
Frick that!

3444
02:35:28,880 --> 02:35:30,060
Okay, so I just wanna sell a house.

3445
02:35:30,700 --> 02:35:31,920
But you just got a house.

3446
02:35:32,120 --> 02:35:32,720
Frick yeah.

3447
02:35:32,720 --> 02:35:36,140
Alright chat, let's get rid of this bad boy, baby!

3448
02:35:37,540 --> 02:35:37,940
Bruh.

3449
02:35:38,140 --> 02:35:39,560
This is what I've all been waiting for.

3450
02:35:39,760 --> 02:35:41,980
Listen, girls, I've decided that...

3451
02:35:41,980 --> 02:35:44,760
I realized that living in a big box had no purpose.

3452
02:35:44,980 --> 02:35:45,940
And I don't wanna do it anymore.

3453
02:35:46,080 --> 02:35:47,740
So, I will be taking your offers.

3454
02:35:47,860 --> 02:35:48,740
Which one should I be clicking on?

3455
02:35:49,240 --> 02:35:50,380
I'm too poor for this.

3456
02:35:50,620 --> 02:35:51,080
Bottom right.

3457
02:35:51,700 --> 02:35:53,540
I can't afford a luxury apartment.

3458
02:35:54,200 --> 02:35:55,320
Also, Doobie, I think you're muted.

3459
02:35:57,920 --> 02:35:58,600
I know!

3460
02:35:59,420 --> 02:36:01,300
Doobie, which one are you putting in?

3461
02:36:02,720 --> 02:36:03,260
Stewart.

3462
02:36:03,560 --> 02:36:05,720
Oh, she's muted-muted.

3463
02:36:06,320 --> 02:36:07,140
What's going on?

3464
02:36:07,280 --> 02:36:07,600
Alright, fine.

3465
02:36:07,680 --> 02:36:08,500
She said...

3466
02:36:08,500 --> 02:36:09,140
Foul!

3467
02:36:09,140 --> 02:36:10,420
I'm trusting you!

3468
02:36:12,220 --> 02:36:14,800
You got 800k?

3469
02:36:14,980 --> 02:36:17,440
You got the max profit?

3470
02:36:18,160 --> 02:36:18,620
Foul!

3471
02:36:18,700 --> 02:36:19,880
How could you foul?

3472
02:36:20,340 --> 02:36:20,900
Foul!

3473
02:36:20,980 --> 02:36:21,760
How could you?

3474
02:36:22,240 --> 02:36:22,620
I don't know!

3475
02:36:22,740 --> 02:36:23,480
I don't know!

3476
02:36:23,900 --> 02:36:24,460
Foul!

3477
02:36:24,620 --> 02:36:25,360
She's already rich!

3478
02:36:25,360 --> 02:36:27,240
It pays to be single, ladies and gentlemen!

3479
02:36:27,680 --> 02:36:29,920
No, it pays to be friends with me!

3480
02:36:30,140 --> 02:36:32,000
Look what she did to Doobie!

3481
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:33,660
She can't even talk anymore!

3482
02:36:34,560 --> 02:36:35,160
I'll give you the check.

3483
02:36:35,300 --> 02:36:35,440
Hello?

3484
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:37,060
Welcome back!

3485
02:36:37,280 --> 02:36:38,040
Welcome back!

3486
02:36:38,460 --> 02:36:39,000
Hi!

3487
02:36:39,000 --> 02:36:40,660
Why did I ask Doobie to do that?

3488
02:36:41,720 --> 02:36:44,640
You skipped my purchase offer.

3489
02:36:45,700 --> 02:36:47,320
Oh, for 320?

3490
02:36:47,880 --> 02:36:49,040
Is it worth it?

3491
02:36:49,580 --> 02:36:50,920
Yeah, but I could get 560.

3492
02:36:52,080 --> 02:36:53,140
Oh, this is...

3493
02:36:53,140 --> 02:36:54,000
Oh, let's go gambling.

3494
02:36:55,020 --> 02:36:55,240
Oh.

3495
02:36:56,000 --> 02:36:56,700
Oh, wait!

3496
02:36:56,720 --> 02:36:57,160
That's better!

3497
02:36:57,620 --> 02:36:58,200
That's better!

3498
02:36:58,640 --> 02:36:59,480
Let's go!

3499
02:36:59,580 --> 02:37:00,340
Let's go!

3500
02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:02,500
Yeah, let's do it.

3501
02:37:03,020 --> 02:37:03,540
She profited, boys!

3502
02:37:03,720 --> 02:37:04,540
She profited, boys!

3503
02:37:04,660 --> 02:37:05,300
I profited!

3504
02:37:05,400 --> 02:37:06,200
That's 100k!

3505
02:37:06,220 --> 02:37:06,780
That's all that matters!

3506
02:37:07,100 --> 02:37:07,440
Mula!

3507
02:37:08,360 --> 02:37:08,880
Okay.

3508
02:37:09,460 --> 02:37:10,560
She Doobie back!

3509
02:37:11,160 --> 02:37:12,640
I'm whole, and I'm happy.

3510
02:37:13,280 --> 02:37:13,600
Okay.

3511
02:37:16,540 --> 02:37:17,420
What just happened?

3512
02:37:17,820 --> 02:37:18,280
Oh, no!

3513
02:37:18,640 --> 02:37:19,220
Oh, oh, oh!

3514
02:37:20,340 --> 02:37:20,860
Yeah!

3515
02:37:20,940 --> 02:37:23,060
Oh, the civilian tax!

3516
02:37:23,360 --> 02:37:24,220
The rich gets richer!

3517
02:37:25,900 --> 02:37:27,520
The rich gets richer!

3518
02:37:28,500 --> 02:37:32,740
Dog, I came into rich from smart real estate investing.

3519
02:37:32,840 --> 02:37:34,060
It is what it is.

3520
02:37:34,740 --> 02:37:35,180
Investment.

3521
02:37:35,700 --> 02:37:36,660
Oh, you want to get another house?

3522
02:37:36,900 --> 02:37:38,820
I know that house faster than anyone else has.

3523
02:37:39,160 --> 02:37:39,600
Doobert.

3524
02:37:40,600 --> 02:37:41,740
Oh, the Doobie tax.

3525
02:37:42,200 --> 02:37:43,080
Oh, she's making it back!

3526
02:37:43,560 --> 02:37:45,020
I really, really need money.

3527
02:37:47,140 --> 02:37:50,900
Ever since she threw her first party in college, it's never been the same.

3528
02:37:52,680 --> 02:37:54,020
Oh, she can buy...

3529
02:37:54,020 --> 02:37:56,800
Oh, we can buy an island home.

3530
02:37:57,020 --> 02:37:57,500
Oh, my gosh!

3531
02:37:57,500 --> 02:37:57,840
Oh, my God!

3532
02:37:58,280 --> 02:38:00,040
You bought a holiday home in Europe.

3533
02:38:00,620 --> 02:38:03,820
Why do you have a swimming pool next to your house on the ocean water?

3534
02:38:03,980 --> 02:38:05,840
Because the ocean water is salt.

3535
02:38:06,180 --> 02:38:07,540
So, she wants a chlorine thing.

3536
02:38:07,780 --> 02:38:08,560
What are you mad about?

3537
02:38:09,120 --> 02:38:11,340
She wants a chlorine water.

3538
02:38:11,580 --> 02:38:12,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3539
02:38:12,240 --> 02:38:13,240
I want to be clean.

3540
02:38:13,600 --> 02:38:14,900
Yeah, and she consumes...

3541
02:38:14,900 --> 02:38:15,460
And poop in the water.

3542
02:38:15,800 --> 02:38:16,240
Exactly.

3543
02:38:17,020 --> 02:38:18,780
The ocean is nature's toilet.

3544
02:38:20,500 --> 02:38:21,060
Oh, no.

3545
02:38:21,220 --> 02:38:22,320
You lost that.

3546
02:38:22,700 --> 02:38:25,180
Oh, you get a kid while having three loans!

3547
02:38:25,640 --> 02:38:26,300
No, no.

3548
02:38:26,300 --> 02:38:28,380
Yeah, kill a three-year-old!

3549
02:38:28,400 --> 02:38:29,780
I think that's a bad idea, maybe.

3550
02:38:30,140 --> 02:38:31,640
She's trying to be a robotics engineer.

3551
02:38:32,000 --> 02:38:32,480
Get a pet.

3552
02:38:33,000 --> 02:38:33,300
Yeah.

3553
02:38:33,340 --> 02:38:34,400
Oh, you got a cat!

3554
02:38:35,220 --> 02:38:35,860
Hi, hi!

3555
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:36,300
Yeah.

3556
02:38:36,440 --> 02:38:38,340
How are you this broke?

3557
02:38:38,480 --> 02:38:39,640
And a full-time mom.

3558
02:38:40,420 --> 02:38:41,900
How are you this broke?

3559
02:38:42,380 --> 02:38:44,340
Yeah, she likes to party.

3560
02:38:44,880 --> 02:38:46,360
How are you this broke?

3561
02:38:46,360 --> 02:38:49,380
She's here for a fun time, not a long time.

3562
02:38:49,620 --> 02:38:50,920
My husband supports me, okay?

3563
02:38:51,000 --> 02:38:51,240
Yeah.

3564
02:38:51,980 --> 02:38:52,120
That's true.

3565
02:38:52,120 --> 02:38:53,000
Oh, okay, yeah.

3566
02:38:53,060 --> 02:38:53,960
Jeff Bezos strat.

3567
02:38:55,160 --> 02:38:57,320
No, he's also in debt.

3568
02:38:57,680 --> 02:38:59,560
Guys, I'm speedrunning my life.

3569
02:38:59,700 --> 02:39:01,040
I'm pretty sure...

3570
02:39:01,040 --> 02:39:02,080
I'm pretty...

3571
02:39:02,660 --> 02:39:06,200
Her husband is, like, a house husband, too.

3572
02:39:07,480 --> 02:39:07,720
Bam.

3573
02:39:07,920 --> 02:39:08,520
Give me something good.

3574
02:39:08,840 --> 02:39:09,340
Oh, two!

3575
02:39:09,660 --> 02:39:10,940
That's pretty good.

3576
02:39:14,560 --> 02:39:15,200
120k.

3577
02:39:15,380 --> 02:39:16,680
Guys, I'm effing...

3578
02:39:16,680 --> 02:39:17,660
I'm drowning in bands.

3579
02:39:17,660 --> 02:39:19,480
She's really speedrunning life right now.

3580
02:39:19,500 --> 02:39:20,860
I'm drowning in bands.

3581
02:39:21,940 --> 02:39:22,580
Okay.

3582
02:39:23,360 --> 02:39:24,140
Alright, bet.

3583
02:39:24,520 --> 02:39:24,880
Bet, bet, bet.

3584
02:39:25,360 --> 02:39:26,580
Left side was investment, right?

3585
02:39:27,300 --> 02:39:28,260
Okay, investment.

3586
02:39:28,480 --> 02:39:28,940
I already...

3587
02:39:28,940 --> 02:39:29,480
You know what?

3588
02:39:30,140 --> 02:39:32,380
I don't know if I want to get taxed again.

3589
02:39:32,800 --> 02:39:35,760
I don't know how to pay the government more taxes.

3590
02:39:37,260 --> 02:39:38,440
You didn't get married?

3591
02:39:38,600 --> 02:39:39,000
Casual?

3592
02:39:39,360 --> 02:39:40,000
I already...

3593
02:39:40,000 --> 02:39:41,000
Yeah, I got married.

3594
02:39:42,100 --> 02:39:42,580
Casual?

3595
02:39:42,860 --> 02:39:43,900
Alright, let's see.

3596
02:39:44,640 --> 02:39:45,060
What?

3597
02:39:45,640 --> 02:39:46,440
You know what?

3598
02:39:46,460 --> 02:39:47,340
I'm gonna risk it.

3599
02:39:47,760 --> 02:39:49,640
The government needs more money anyway.

3600
02:39:50,280 --> 02:39:51,160
Wait, so I'm confused.

3601
02:39:51,300 --> 02:39:52,080
I never understood.

3602
02:39:52,080 --> 02:39:53,300
Why do you have kids in this game?

3603
02:39:53,360 --> 02:39:54,600
Do they not turn into money?

3604
02:39:54,800 --> 02:39:55,220
They do.

3605
02:39:55,360 --> 02:39:56,220
They turn into...

3606
02:39:56,220 --> 02:39:57,240
They turn into...

3607
02:39:57,240 --> 02:39:58,440
They turn into $20.

3608
02:39:59,260 --> 02:40:00,300
They turn into $20?

3609
02:40:00,980 --> 02:40:03,920
Yeah, you just get $20 off your child.

3610
02:40:03,940 --> 02:40:04,740
That's terrible, bro.

3611
02:40:06,180 --> 02:40:07,600
What does the dog turn into?

3612
02:40:09,320 --> 02:40:10,280
What does the dog turn into?

3613
02:40:10,960 --> 02:40:13,520
The dog turns into $20 too.

3614
02:40:13,880 --> 02:40:15,060
They're in the same level.

3615
02:40:15,480 --> 02:40:16,780
Human equals dog.

3616
02:40:17,340 --> 02:40:17,580
No.

3617
02:40:18,100 --> 02:40:18,660
No, no.

3618
02:40:18,700 --> 02:40:20,680
A child equals a dog.

3619
02:40:21,140 --> 02:40:21,640
Oh, a child.

3620
02:40:21,640 --> 02:40:22,180
Oh, yeah, that's fair.

3621
02:40:22,880 --> 02:40:27,720
Because, like, if you think about it, when they're children, a dog is smarter than a child.

3622
02:40:28,880 --> 02:40:29,520
That is...

3623
02:40:29,520 --> 02:40:30,280
That is true.

3624
02:40:30,420 --> 02:40:31,800
At least a dog can, like...

3625
02:40:31,860 --> 02:40:33,260
At least a dog on an airplane doesn't have to be a child.

3626
02:40:33,260 --> 02:40:39,660
I don't have to change a diaper off of a dog versus a child.

3627
02:40:39,880 --> 02:40:41,560
I don't need to feed the dog.

3628
02:40:41,800 --> 02:40:43,900
Well, I do need to feed the dog, but, like, the dog can...

3629
02:40:43,900 --> 02:40:44,400
You don't feed a dog.

3630
02:40:44,400 --> 02:40:47,020
No, the dog can eat the food themselves.

3631
02:40:47,160 --> 02:40:48,780
I don't have to hold a spoon for it.

3632
02:40:48,800 --> 02:40:49,680
They can hunt for their own meal.

3633
02:40:49,800 --> 02:40:50,320
Oh, true.

3634
02:40:50,320 --> 02:40:51,020
Astronomer.

3635
02:40:51,280 --> 02:40:52,540
Oh, my God.

3636
02:40:53,200 --> 02:40:53,660
That's true.

3637
02:40:53,660 --> 02:40:54,080
Let's go.

3638
02:40:54,100 --> 02:40:54,440
What?

3639
02:40:54,600 --> 02:40:55,720
We're going to space again.

3640
02:40:56,820 --> 02:40:57,920
We're going back to space.

3641
02:40:57,920 --> 02:41:00,200
How does staring at the moon equal 200,000 a year?

3642
02:41:00,960 --> 02:41:01,900
What are we even doing?

3643
02:41:01,900 --> 02:41:03,560
I'm forgetting when the sun explodes.

3644
02:41:04,140 --> 02:41:06,560
You're just feeding the Libras and Scorpios.

3645
02:41:06,780 --> 02:41:08,000
You're gonna find one of the black holes.

3646
02:41:09,160 --> 02:41:10,880
You're just astrology-ing people.

3647
02:41:11,360 --> 02:41:14,800
You're gonna find a black hole and drive the Earth to it.

3648
02:41:17,120 --> 02:41:18,820
Are you playing Omni-Man gameplay?

3649
02:41:18,860 --> 02:41:19,520
Oh, my God.

3650
02:41:19,520 --> 02:41:19,880
I have two.

3651
02:41:21,100 --> 02:41:22,640
Oh, you're so...

3652
02:41:22,640 --> 02:41:23,720
Oh, you sell your house.

3653
02:41:24,180 --> 02:41:25,420
Oh, a retro video game.

3654
02:41:25,520 --> 02:41:26,060
That's pretty sick.

3655
02:41:26,300 --> 02:41:26,720
Yeah.

3656
02:41:27,360 --> 02:41:28,600
Let's get video games.

3657
02:41:29,780 --> 02:41:30,620
Video games.

3658
02:41:31,360 --> 02:41:31,680
All right.

3659
02:41:31,880 --> 02:41:32,220
All right.

3660
02:41:32,500 --> 02:41:35,200
Guys, I'm gonna roll a 10, reach the retirement home, and then just die.

3661
02:41:36,640 --> 02:41:37,020
Four.

3662
02:41:37,600 --> 02:41:38,400
Okay, fine.

3663
02:41:38,500 --> 02:41:39,620
We're all doing low numbers.

3664
02:41:39,920 --> 02:41:40,140
One, two, three, four.

3665
02:41:40,140 --> 02:41:41,260
And check the lottery ticket numbers.

3666
02:41:42,440 --> 02:41:42,880
Bro.

3667
02:41:43,760 --> 02:41:44,940
How is she so lucky?

3668
02:41:44,940 --> 02:41:46,680
I do not need any more money.

3669
02:41:46,880 --> 02:41:47,800
She literally...

3670
02:41:47,800 --> 02:41:48,760
My life is money.

3671
02:41:48,760 --> 02:41:53,760
She literally siphoned off of Doobie's luck, and then she's riding high.

3672
02:41:53,760 --> 02:41:56,060
I watched Doobie, that's not me.

3673
02:41:56,500 --> 02:42:00,580
She went to her party and just, like, took everything from her.

3674
02:42:01,120 --> 02:42:03,380
Guys, I'm on my Sigma groin set.

3675
02:42:05,140 --> 02:42:07,700
This is just like real life Fillion.

3676
02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:10,960
Bro, if you think I'm rich, you gotta get your brainstem checked.

3677
02:42:12,200 --> 02:42:12,560
That's it.

3678
02:42:12,580 --> 02:42:13,900
I'm going online college.

3679
02:42:14,320 --> 02:42:15,180
All right.

3680
02:42:16,180 --> 02:42:16,720
I want...

3681
02:42:16,720 --> 02:42:18,020
I want a better job.

3682
02:42:18,020 --> 02:42:19,560
How much money have you spent on your stream?

3683
02:42:20,360 --> 02:42:21,040
On my stream?

3684
02:42:21,180 --> 02:42:21,840
Right now?

3685
02:42:21,980 --> 02:42:22,340
Today?

3686
02:42:22,580 --> 02:42:22,740
Today?

3687
02:42:23,420 --> 02:42:23,480
Oh, yay!

3688
02:42:23,920 --> 02:42:26,120
Oh, I can be a strawberry, too!

3689
02:42:26,340 --> 02:42:26,700
We can...

3690
02:42:26,700 --> 02:42:29,060
We can both find that black hole!

3691
02:42:29,660 --> 02:42:30,320
Let's go.

3692
02:42:30,540 --> 02:42:31,120
Let's go!

3693
02:42:31,240 --> 02:42:33,120
You wanna talk telescopes or what?

3694
02:42:33,380 --> 02:42:37,500
Oh my god, we can both find that black hole and make sure the Earth gets sucked in.

3695
02:42:38,240 --> 02:42:38,620
Perfect.

3696
02:42:39,460 --> 02:42:40,580
That's my dream right there.

3697
02:42:40,680 --> 02:42:41,620
I think I got taxed.

3698
02:42:41,760 --> 02:42:43,560
We'll give them the coordinates, but after...

3699
02:42:43,560 --> 02:42:45,400
Yeah, we'll be like, it's okay, I got taxed.

3700
02:42:45,400 --> 02:42:47,420
Dang, I...

3701
02:42:47,420 --> 02:42:49,800
Oh my god!

3702
02:42:50,400 --> 02:42:50,700
Oh my god.

3703
02:42:51,320 --> 02:42:52,540
Oh my god.

3704
02:42:52,540 --> 02:42:52,880
Oh my god.

3705
02:42:53,140 --> 02:42:53,940
I'll never leave.

3706
02:42:53,960 --> 02:42:54,760
That's Ashley Ashe.

3707
02:42:54,800 --> 02:42:56,200
I'll never leave.

3708
02:42:56,640 --> 02:42:59,280
I love the government.

3709
02:43:00,000 --> 02:43:01,720
Two girls, one moon.

3710
02:43:01,820 --> 02:43:03,220
I love the government.

3711
02:43:05,660 --> 02:43:08,680
Wait, so I have never gotten taxed this entire game yet.

3712
02:43:08,980 --> 02:43:10,460
At what point is it evasion?

3713
02:43:11,300 --> 02:43:13,320
Like, the first time?

3714
02:43:13,320 --> 02:43:17,100
I'm getting taxed more.

3715
02:43:17,980 --> 02:43:21,640
You're gonna get audited after this stream.

3716
02:43:22,020 --> 02:43:22,500
Nuh-uh.

3717
02:43:24,200 --> 02:43:26,100
Oh, second chance!

3718
02:43:26,620 --> 02:43:27,980
Ooh, marriage.

3719
02:43:29,460 --> 02:43:35,360
You like, finally fulfilled your business life and now you're...

3720
02:43:35,360 --> 02:43:37,580
And now you're looking into your...

3721
02:43:39,020 --> 02:43:40,160
She disappears.

3722
02:43:41,480 --> 02:43:43,180
She could be a gold digger.

3723
02:43:43,600 --> 02:43:46,120
She chose you after you became an astronomer.

3724
02:43:46,200 --> 02:43:47,540
I'm the gold digger, actually.

3725
02:43:47,720 --> 02:43:48,540
Cough up 10k.

3726
02:43:50,680 --> 02:43:52,340
At least it's not 20, okay?

3727
02:43:52,800 --> 02:43:53,580
That's true.

3728
02:43:54,660 --> 02:43:56,440
Wait, so why can't we marry each other?

3729
02:43:57,020 --> 02:43:57,720
We can't.

3730
02:43:58,380 --> 02:43:59,800
It's a conflict of interest.

3731
02:43:59,920 --> 02:44:01,260
Yeah, it's a conflict of interest.

3732
02:44:01,660 --> 02:44:02,360
We're competing in life.

3733
02:44:02,620 --> 02:44:03,040
Yeah.

3734
02:44:04,580 --> 02:44:07,440
We can never be together, we're all vtubers.

3735
02:44:07,780 --> 02:44:09,040
Yeah, we're all too competitive.

3736
02:44:10,280 --> 02:44:11,300
Ooh, six.

3737
02:44:11,520 --> 02:44:12,220
Wait, who's that?

3738
02:44:15,220 --> 02:44:15,780
Bowtax.

3739
02:44:15,920 --> 02:44:16,640
Oh my god!

3740
02:44:16,920 --> 02:44:18,480
Oh, Doobie, what happened?

3741
02:44:19,920 --> 02:44:20,480
What do you mean?

3742
02:44:20,680 --> 02:44:21,800
What do you mean?

3743
02:44:24,180 --> 02:44:24,740
What happened?

3744
02:44:27,320 --> 02:44:29,140
I need to invest.

3745
02:44:31,260 --> 02:44:32,960
That's on yourself, big guy.

3746
02:44:35,080 --> 02:44:36,060
Oh, thank god.

3747
02:44:36,560 --> 02:44:38,540
Her dead life is turning around!

3748
02:44:38,540 --> 02:44:39,840
And she gets a house!

3749
02:44:40,360 --> 02:44:41,460
And a house!

3750
02:44:42,140 --> 02:44:44,560
I'm gonna buy another house even though I don't have any money.

3751
02:44:44,620 --> 02:44:45,060
350!

3752
02:44:45,860 --> 02:44:47,180
Bro, the Doob back is real.

3753
02:44:47,420 --> 02:44:48,100
Holy frick.

3754
02:44:49,040 --> 02:44:50,700
You could've gotten another loan.

3755
02:44:50,780 --> 02:44:51,460
She Doobie back!

3756
02:44:51,780 --> 02:44:52,120
We have three loans!

3757
02:44:53,900 --> 02:44:56,040
No problem, I'll be able to pay him off at the end.

3758
02:44:56,420 --> 02:44:57,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3759
02:44:57,800 --> 02:44:58,780
You'll see, you'll see.

3760
02:44:59,260 --> 02:44:59,580
I believe.

3761
02:45:00,980 --> 02:45:02,940
With all those houses, I believe.

3762
02:45:05,480 --> 02:45:06,660
You guys watch Arcane?

3763
02:45:07,040 --> 02:45:08,140
No, I haven't.

3764
02:45:08,140 --> 02:45:08,740
No.

3765
02:45:08,980 --> 02:45:10,560
Because I don't want to play League.

3766
02:45:12,080 --> 02:45:16,420
I heard if you watch Arcane, it's gonna make you play League and I'm afraid of that.

3767
02:45:21,420 --> 02:45:23,280
You can be a dog.

3768
02:45:23,420 --> 02:45:24,820
You can get a pet, yeah.

3769
02:45:26,360 --> 02:45:28,640
Oh, you're the cat lady!

3770
02:45:29,060 --> 02:45:30,200
I'm gonna train this into a Pokemon.

3771
02:45:31,480 --> 02:45:32,680
I'm gonna see how many fights I can win.

3772
02:45:33,240 --> 02:45:34,320
Oh my god.

3773
02:45:34,980 --> 02:45:36,440
You're gonna be a cat lady.

3774
02:45:36,440 --> 02:45:37,900
Oh, come on.

3775
02:45:37,920 --> 02:45:38,780
Did I get a cat or a dog?

3776
02:45:38,780 --> 02:45:40,120
You're gonna be a single cat lady.

3777
02:45:40,300 --> 02:45:40,740
No, you got a cat.

3778
02:45:41,240 --> 02:45:41,720
Single cat lady.

3779
02:45:42,040 --> 02:45:43,340
Yeah, that's you!

3780
02:45:43,780 --> 02:45:46,140
You could train it to throw bricks on people like that one dog.

3781
02:45:46,140 --> 02:45:46,840
Oh, yeah!

3782
02:45:47,200 --> 02:45:48,700
I heard about that.

3783
02:45:49,580 --> 02:45:50,460
What the...

3784
02:45:50,460 --> 02:45:52,220
Renovate my... I'm gonna throw a barbecue party.

3785
02:45:52,380 --> 02:45:53,040
I don't need renovation.

3786
02:45:53,300 --> 02:45:53,840
W party.

3787
02:45:54,600 --> 02:45:55,280
Let's go.

3788
02:45:57,400 --> 02:45:58,660
Oh, my turn!

3789
02:46:01,300 --> 02:46:02,640
Wish I would land on myself.

3790
02:46:02,640 --> 02:46:02,860
Boom!

3791
02:46:05,240 --> 02:46:07,460
This music is all I can hear in my brain nowadays.

3792
02:46:07,460 --> 02:46:07,960
Oh, yeah, baby!

3793
02:46:09,720 --> 02:46:10,120
Woohoo!

3794
02:46:11,220 --> 02:46:13,900
To be honest, is being a single cat lady that bad?

3795
02:46:13,940 --> 02:46:14,480
It's not.

3796
02:46:14,680 --> 02:46:14,980
Free money.

3797
02:46:15,400 --> 02:46:15,960
Seems alright.

3798
02:46:16,220 --> 02:46:20,140
It's not, but like, if there's an emerge... Oh, you can train your cat to dial 9-1-1.

3799
02:46:20,480 --> 02:46:20,960
You can?

3800
02:46:21,280 --> 02:46:21,740
Yeah, you can.

3801
02:46:21,800 --> 02:46:23,340
There was like, there was a cat.

3802
02:46:23,720 --> 02:46:28,700
I watched a YouTube short of some guy that got like, a heart attack.

3803
02:46:28,800 --> 02:46:31,100
And then the cat dialed 9-1-1 and saved him.

3804
02:46:31,100 --> 02:46:32,700
He like, trained his cat.

3805
02:46:33,420 --> 02:46:34,500
They're really flippant.

3806
02:46:34,640 --> 02:46:35,420
They might not do it.

3807
02:46:35,560 --> 02:46:37,040
The cat only dialed it because he was gonna have no food otherwise.

3808
02:46:37,220 --> 02:46:38,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3809
02:46:38,300 --> 02:46:38,820
Like, exactly.

3810
02:46:38,960 --> 02:46:40,980
Because he thought that the cat didn't learn.

3811
02:46:41,200 --> 02:46:42,760
And then, because he was trying to make him learn.

3812
02:46:42,980 --> 02:46:45,360
And then he wouldn't do it until, like, he got a heart attack.

3813
02:46:45,480 --> 02:46:47,120
And then he actually dialed 9-1-1.

3814
02:46:48,000 --> 02:46:49,320
How does a cat dial 9-1-1?

3815
02:46:49,320 --> 02:46:49,700
Give me your money!

3816
02:46:51,920 --> 02:46:52,680
Wait, what?

3817
02:46:55,520 --> 02:46:56,200
You distract...

3818
02:46:56,200 --> 02:46:57,120
She's like, give me money!

3819
02:46:57,120 --> 02:46:59,640
Doobie's like, it's the moan shark time.

3820
02:46:59,940 --> 02:47:02,840
It's time for mine to get my money back.

3821
02:47:04,200 --> 02:47:04,820
Okay...

3822
02:47:04,820 --> 02:47:05,480
You fucked me over.

3823
02:47:07,100 --> 02:47:09,000
She's brass smelling it.

3824
02:47:09,500 --> 02:47:11,100
Doobie, put down the gun.

3825
02:47:11,320 --> 02:47:12,420
She has six loans.

3826
02:47:12,980 --> 02:47:14,660
Put down the gun, Doobie.

3827
02:47:14,840 --> 02:47:15,720
Shave your beard.

3828
02:47:15,940 --> 02:47:19,720
She broke into your house and was like, give me the...

3829
02:47:19,720 --> 02:47:20,780
I'm back, baby!

3830
02:47:21,060 --> 02:47:24,100
Another spin round two.

3831
02:47:24,100 --> 02:47:24,640
Loser!

3832
02:47:25,660 --> 02:47:27,780
You're never gonna get your 100k back.

3833
02:47:28,080 --> 02:47:29,360
You're never gonna get your...

3834
02:47:33,200 --> 02:47:37,220
She needs the money, it's the least you can do, you bajillionaire.

3835
02:47:40,300 --> 02:47:41,920
Get it straight.

3836
02:47:43,580 --> 02:47:45,020
Just like Bezos.

3837
02:47:45,500 --> 02:47:47,740
Just like Bezos right there.

3838
02:47:48,260 --> 02:47:50,300
Doobie is like the Amazon worker.

3839
02:47:51,240 --> 02:47:52,480
This is compensation.

3840
02:47:52,920 --> 02:47:54,300
When you drugged me in college.

3841
02:47:57,260 --> 02:47:59,920
And made her throw all those parties.

3842
02:48:03,460 --> 02:48:04,460
Forced you, like...

3843
02:48:04,460 --> 02:48:06,780
You, like, convinced her to throw all those parties.

3844
02:48:07,660 --> 02:48:07,820
Billion.

3845
02:48:07,840 --> 02:48:09,960
I'm not the one that did all that stuff, bro.

3846
02:48:09,960 --> 02:48:11,220
Yeah, but you're like...

3847
02:48:11,220 --> 02:48:13,700
Bro, it would be so cool if you threw a major...

3848
02:48:13,700 --> 02:48:15,840
If you threw a ranger right now.

3849
02:48:15,980 --> 02:48:16,380
Okay.

3850
02:48:16,880 --> 02:48:18,180
You were like, whoa, Doobie.

3851
02:48:18,280 --> 02:48:20,220
It would be so funny if you threw that party.

3852
02:48:21,860 --> 02:48:24,340
Look at that, you literally made half of that money back.

3853
02:48:26,700 --> 02:48:27,820
Just ran her over.

3854
02:48:28,260 --> 02:48:29,180
Oh, you should be risky.

3855
02:48:30,320 --> 02:48:30,960
Frick yeah.

3856
02:48:31,540 --> 02:48:31,920
Yeah.

3857
02:48:32,080 --> 02:48:32,900
What does risky do?

3858
02:48:33,720 --> 02:48:34,900
You can get a house.

3859
02:48:35,780 --> 02:48:36,920
I'm gonna get a house.

3860
02:48:37,320 --> 02:48:38,160
Ask me anything.

3861
02:48:39,260 --> 02:48:41,600
If I end up on tax in the night, I'm gonna be pissed.

3862
02:48:42,040 --> 02:48:42,860
Oh, that looks bad.

3863
02:48:43,920 --> 02:48:44,980
No, you don't.

3864
02:48:47,240 --> 02:48:49,300
You can still get taxed though.

3865
02:48:49,300 --> 02:48:49,940
Nuh-uh.

3866
02:48:49,960 --> 02:48:50,220
Yeah.

3867
02:48:50,680 --> 02:48:51,440
Nuh-uh.

3868
02:48:51,560 --> 02:48:53,020
To be fair, she's been so lucky.

3869
02:48:53,180 --> 02:48:55,300
Oh, she got another pet or a child.

3870
02:48:56,340 --> 02:48:56,680
Dude.

3871
02:48:57,000 --> 02:48:59,560
Why am I becoming a crazy cat lady?

3872
02:48:59,560 --> 02:49:00,500
You're a single mother.

3873
02:49:01,140 --> 02:49:02,000
Or a cat lady.

3874
02:49:02,000 --> 02:49:02,860
Maybe you'll get a dog.

3875
02:49:03,020 --> 02:49:04,020
Yeah, maybe you'll get a dog.

3876
02:49:04,660 --> 02:49:05,880
Just give me a second animal.

3877
02:49:06,360 --> 02:49:07,040
Frick this dog.

3878
02:49:07,060 --> 02:49:07,980
Oh, you got a dog.

3879
02:49:08,420 --> 02:49:09,040
A pupper.

3880
02:49:10,380 --> 02:49:11,640
Why is he green?

3881
02:49:11,820 --> 02:49:12,660
What are you gonna name him?

3882
02:49:12,900 --> 02:49:14,960
You don't just ask a dog why he's green.

3883
02:49:15,600 --> 02:49:16,500
I'm gonna name him Greedo.

3884
02:49:16,500 --> 02:49:18,060
I like how you have like...

3885
02:49:18,060 --> 02:49:19,360
You got two dogs and you're like...

3886
02:49:19,360 --> 02:49:21,020
I gotta get a new car for these pets.

3887
02:49:22,940 --> 02:49:25,740
Oh, nice.

3888
02:49:26,000 --> 02:49:26,380
One.

3889
02:49:27,760 --> 02:49:28,200
One.

3890
02:49:28,760 --> 02:49:30,040
Oh, I can build a tree house.

3891
02:49:30,660 --> 02:49:32,600
Oh, I wanna build a tree house.

3892
02:49:32,880 --> 02:49:33,660
That's kinda cool.

3893
02:49:33,840 --> 02:49:35,800
Yeah, I got my own tree house, guys.

3894
02:49:38,440 --> 02:49:39,740
Okay, here I go.

3895
02:49:44,600 --> 02:49:45,480
Another 10.

3896
02:49:47,520 --> 02:49:48,980
Oh, it's green.

3897
02:49:49,160 --> 02:49:49,480
Okay.

3898
02:49:50,280 --> 02:49:52,720
Do you really need another house, Bao?

3899
02:49:53,540 --> 02:49:54,060
Yes.

3900
02:49:54,700 --> 02:49:56,280
Bao, invest in another house.

3901
02:49:57,260 --> 02:49:58,580
I'm gonna invest in another house.

3902
02:49:59,100 --> 02:50:00,260
Ooh, duped.

3903
02:50:01,140 --> 02:50:02,180
Okay, she duped me.

3904
02:50:02,220 --> 02:50:02,600
Dupy tax.

3905
02:50:02,960 --> 02:50:04,940
And I'm not a cheapo like you.

3906
02:50:05,080 --> 02:50:05,340
Yeah.

3907
02:50:05,580 --> 02:50:08,380
I'm gonna lose all of it at the end anyways when I have to pay off my loan.

3908
02:50:10,340 --> 02:50:10,860
Fate.

3909
02:50:11,360 --> 02:50:13,860
Alright, will she have to pay taxes?

3910
02:50:13,980 --> 02:50:14,260
Yeah, baby!

3911
02:50:16,000 --> 02:50:17,280
You remember that raise?

3912
02:50:17,480 --> 02:50:18,240
You didn't spin, Bao.

3913
02:50:18,240 --> 02:50:19,120
You didn't spin it, yeah.

3914
02:50:19,320 --> 02:50:20,000
Oh, I thought I did.

3915
02:50:21,680 --> 02:50:22,540
Yeah, baby!

3916
02:50:23,240 --> 02:50:23,920
Even better.

3917
02:50:24,340 --> 02:50:25,160
Even better.

3918
02:50:25,420 --> 02:50:25,780
Oh my god.

3919
02:50:26,080 --> 02:50:27,120
It's just that easy.

3920
02:50:27,320 --> 02:50:30,080
Guys, I think I'm a sleeper winning this game.

3921
02:50:30,300 --> 02:50:30,800
Holy shit.

3922
02:50:31,240 --> 02:50:31,340
I am!

3923
02:50:31,340 --> 02:50:35,580
I think she's sleeping on this game W.

3924
02:50:35,740 --> 02:50:36,640
I'm not gonna lie.

3925
02:50:38,580 --> 02:50:39,560
Watch it be doobert.

3926
02:50:39,760 --> 02:50:40,540
Alright, don't worry.

3927
02:50:41,440 --> 02:50:43,840
It's okay, you're gonna have to stop anyway.

3928
02:50:44,680 --> 02:50:47,460
Bao just might kill John Lennon after a little bit.

3929
02:50:47,820 --> 02:50:48,980
I'm gonna lock in.

3930
02:50:49,040 --> 02:50:50,960
And then y'all get the online course.

3931
02:50:51,080 --> 02:50:52,140
Come back to college.

3932
02:50:52,280 --> 02:50:52,920
Oh, okay.

3933
02:50:53,080 --> 02:50:54,540
I don't think that's a good idea.

3934
02:50:54,780 --> 02:50:55,080
Why not?

3935
02:50:55,320 --> 02:50:58,200
Imagine all the cool parties you can throw online!

3936
02:50:58,640 --> 02:50:59,360
I'll be tempted.

3937
02:50:59,740 --> 02:51:00,080
That's why.

3938
02:51:00,440 --> 02:51:01,320
On Microsoft Teams.

3939
02:51:03,960 --> 02:51:05,180
Through a master's degree!

3940
02:51:05,540 --> 02:51:05,700
What?

3941
02:51:05,700 --> 02:51:06,520
Through those parties.

3942
02:51:06,860 --> 02:51:09,720
I like how they were pushing you to get another degree.

3943
02:51:10,360 --> 02:51:12,200
They were like, are you sure you don't want to go to college?

3944
02:51:12,200 --> 02:51:14,200
What did you just say?

3945
02:51:14,740 --> 02:51:14,980
Oh!

3946
02:51:15,380 --> 02:51:16,400
Oh my god!

3947
02:51:17,100 --> 02:51:18,200
Oh my god!

3948
02:51:18,340 --> 02:51:18,600
Wait!

3949
02:51:19,420 --> 02:51:20,540
She's so back!

3950
02:51:20,780 --> 02:51:21,680
Wait, she's back!

3951
02:51:21,840 --> 02:51:22,440
I'm back!

3952
02:51:22,660 --> 02:51:23,240
She's actually back!

3953
02:51:23,640 --> 02:51:24,940
She's questionable back.

3954
02:51:25,320 --> 02:51:26,080
We need to be determined.

3955
02:51:27,000 --> 02:51:27,860
Where the frick are we on this board?

3956
02:51:27,860 --> 02:51:29,420
Wait, she's almost there.

3957
02:51:30,200 --> 02:51:32,640
I should've never helped Fillion get that max amount.

3958
02:51:33,780 --> 02:51:34,440
How do I... here?

3959
02:51:34,880 --> 02:51:35,580
No, here's the thing.

3960
02:51:35,620 --> 02:51:38,820
I don't have any actual prospects in my life, so...

3961
02:51:38,820 --> 02:51:39,880
I only got money to my name.

3962
02:51:39,960 --> 02:51:40,380
That's so sad!

3963
02:51:41,080 --> 02:51:41,480
Yeah!

3964
02:51:41,480 --> 02:51:42,860
You have a cat and a dog.

3965
02:51:42,860 --> 02:51:44,340
You have a cat and a dog, yeah.

3966
02:51:44,680 --> 02:51:45,060
Exactly.

3967
02:51:45,320 --> 02:51:45,720
You have some purpose.

3968
02:51:46,640 --> 02:51:47,620
And you get another dog!

3969
02:51:49,860 --> 02:51:51,160
And another cat.

3970
02:51:51,180 --> 02:51:52,240
Get another cat!

3971
02:51:52,380 --> 02:51:52,840
Do it!

3972
02:51:52,960 --> 02:51:53,480
Another cat.

3973
02:51:53,620 --> 02:51:54,080
Another cat.

3974
02:51:54,560 --> 02:51:55,480
I'm not adopted a kid.

3975
02:51:55,920 --> 02:51:56,160
Okay.

3976
02:51:56,420 --> 02:51:57,000
Get another cat.

3977
02:51:57,000 --> 02:51:57,420
No!

3978
02:51:57,720 --> 02:51:59,060
What should I name my third cat?

3979
02:52:01,440 --> 02:52:02,660
What should I name my third cat?

3980
02:52:03,500 --> 02:52:04,920
Name it after a chatter, yeah.

3981
02:52:05,280 --> 02:52:07,720
Okay, I'll name him...

3982
02:52:09,460 --> 02:52:09,940
Fillionfan119.

3983
02:52:10,220 --> 02:52:10,440
No.

3984
02:52:10,440 --> 02:52:12,940
Oh my god.

3985
02:52:13,800 --> 02:52:14,280
TinyHawker!

3986
02:52:14,360 --> 02:52:15,420
Oh my god, another cat!

3987
02:52:15,440 --> 02:52:16,620
Yeah, TinyHawker!

3988
02:52:18,040 --> 02:52:18,800
Good job.

3989
02:52:19,540 --> 02:52:21,700
Look at you, living your life.

3990
02:52:22,400 --> 02:52:23,360
Alright, W-Hawker.

3991
02:52:23,880 --> 02:52:24,320
Let's go.

3992
02:52:25,660 --> 02:52:27,300
Now, don't you feel so much more fulfilled?

3993
02:52:27,540 --> 02:52:29,100
Yeah, don't you feel fulfilled now?

3994
02:52:29,480 --> 02:52:31,500
I spent my entire life shoveling poop.

3995
02:52:32,460 --> 02:52:36,580
Yeah, but if you had a kid, you gotta change three times more diapers.

3996
02:52:37,060 --> 02:52:38,680
I just had no kids or dogs.

3997
02:52:38,680 --> 02:52:40,880
You would have to clean so many diapers.

3998
02:52:41,040 --> 02:52:44,280
I don't... I'm not gonna... I'm not... I'd get taxed.

3999
02:52:44,300 --> 02:52:45,080
I can feel it.

4000
02:52:45,480 --> 02:52:46,880
I'm tired of getting taxed.

4001
02:52:47,780 --> 02:52:48,760
She's so tired.

4002
02:52:48,980 --> 02:52:50,120
I'm so tired.

4003
02:52:52,160 --> 02:52:52,960
You know what?

4004
02:52:52,980 --> 02:52:54,220
I'm gonna take a guided tour.

4005
02:52:54,380 --> 02:52:56,660
Yeah, I'm gonna go around the world in 80 days.

4006
02:53:00,160 --> 02:53:00,940
Nice, finally.

4007
02:53:02,260 --> 02:53:02,780
Easy.

4008
02:53:04,840 --> 02:53:07,000
She's gonna go to space again.

4009
02:53:07,140 --> 02:53:07,460
Yeah.

4010
02:53:09,200 --> 02:53:10,460
Chat, are we good?

4011
02:53:11,980 --> 02:53:12,600
Okay.

4012
02:53:12,920 --> 02:53:14,500
I'm never getting to the finish line.

4013
02:53:15,920 --> 02:53:18,840
Okay, I'm gonna get some sunglasses again.

4014
02:53:19,100 --> 02:53:19,400
Awesome.

4015
02:53:19,680 --> 02:53:21,100
Your sunglasses are cool!

4016
02:53:21,840 --> 02:53:22,460
Thank you.

4017
02:53:23,000 --> 02:53:24,000
They look good on you.

4018
02:53:28,600 --> 02:53:31,980
This is my most low-numbered spins.

4019
02:53:34,440 --> 02:53:35,720
Oh, six.

4020
02:53:35,720 --> 02:53:37,980
Just take me to retirement home already.

4021
02:53:38,240 --> 02:53:40,860
I think Chow might be winning this game.

4022
02:53:41,180 --> 02:53:42,580
Take you to retirement.

4023
02:53:43,320 --> 02:53:44,380
Oh, you're back!

4024
02:53:44,900 --> 02:53:45,820
You got 100K!

4025
02:53:46,260 --> 02:53:47,160
Let's go!

4026
02:53:49,460 --> 02:53:50,780
Remember, this is it.

4027
02:53:50,860 --> 02:53:51,660
The end game.

4028
02:53:52,220 --> 02:53:53,060
Alright, watch this.

4029
02:53:53,380 --> 02:53:56,260
I slam home this 10, I make a million bucks, and I'm out of this video game.

4030
02:53:57,100 --> 02:53:58,740
I ride to the sunset!

4031
02:53:59,160 --> 02:54:00,320
Oh, it's almost there!

4032
02:54:00,860 --> 02:54:01,660
Let's go!

4033
02:54:02,940 --> 02:54:04,900
You got your money back!

4034
02:54:05,720 --> 02:54:06,720
I'm out, peace!

4035
02:54:06,900 --> 02:54:07,540
Oh, but you retired!

4036
02:54:07,580 --> 02:54:08,940
See you nerds later, baby!

4037
02:54:09,020 --> 02:54:09,780
I'm out, baby!

4038
02:54:09,900 --> 02:54:10,640
I'm out, baby!

4039
02:54:10,920 --> 02:54:12,220
You wanna be more fulfilled?

4040
02:54:13,120 --> 02:54:14,000
Nah, frick that.

4041
02:54:15,660 --> 02:54:18,180
I spent my whole life fighting for the bills.

4042
02:54:18,320 --> 02:54:19,260
I'm gonna stick with it.

4043
02:54:20,320 --> 02:54:22,980
Well, you left your pets, though.

4044
02:54:23,340 --> 02:54:24,260
You left them!

4045
02:54:24,640 --> 02:54:26,000
I gave them to Peeta, they're fine.

4046
02:54:27,180 --> 02:54:27,960
You left...

4047
02:54:27,960 --> 02:54:29,460
Oh, you didn't wanna give it to Peeta.

4048
02:54:30,180 --> 02:54:30,720
You abandoned all of them!

4049
02:54:30,880 --> 02:54:31,820
You abandoned all of them!

4050
02:54:31,820 --> 02:54:32,960
I gave them to Peeta Mallark!

4051
02:54:33,160 --> 02:54:34,980
You abandoned all of them!

4052
02:54:34,980 --> 02:54:35,220
Woo!

4053
02:54:36,520 --> 02:54:37,440
Bro, how?

4054
02:54:37,700 --> 02:54:38,680
How is she?

4055
02:54:39,960 --> 02:54:40,780
You know what?

4056
02:54:40,880 --> 02:54:43,880
She did organize this collab, so she might be...

4057
02:54:43,880 --> 02:54:44,800
Oh my god, are you serious?

4058
02:54:44,900 --> 02:54:46,000
She might be rigging it.

4059
02:54:46,000 --> 02:54:47,820
You guys know I can actually hack video games?

4060
02:54:49,380 --> 02:54:49,860
Bro...

4061
02:54:49,860 --> 02:54:51,440
Can someone else choose the game next time?

4062
02:54:53,920 --> 02:54:54,400
Bro!

4063
02:54:54,960 --> 02:54:55,380
Yay!

4064
02:54:55,860 --> 02:54:57,040
Yo, white buddies!

4065
02:54:58,580 --> 02:54:59,860
Where's my buddies?

4066
02:55:00,600 --> 02:55:00,800
Oh, the lottery!

4067
02:55:01,060 --> 02:55:01,940
Oh, play the lottery!

4068
02:55:02,380 --> 02:55:03,040
Frick yeah!

4069
02:55:05,200 --> 02:55:05,600
Oh!

4070
02:55:08,680 --> 02:55:09,480
You know...

4071
02:55:09,480 --> 02:55:11,600
Wait, how did you make money when losing a lottery?

4072
02:55:11,820 --> 02:55:12,460
What the frick?

4073
02:55:12,660 --> 02:55:13,740
I made some money by...

4074
02:55:13,740 --> 02:55:14,740
No, it's like she didn't...

4075
02:55:14,740 --> 02:55:17,540
She got like five of the numbers instead of the rest.

4076
02:55:17,560 --> 02:55:18,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4077
02:55:18,320 --> 02:55:19,120
Yeah, well...

4078
02:55:19,120 --> 02:55:19,920
Frick, this game is cheating.

4079
02:55:20,080 --> 02:55:20,480
It's not real.

4080
02:55:20,820 --> 02:55:21,940
You are literally retired.

4081
02:55:22,160 --> 02:55:23,240
Like, what do you...

4082
02:55:23,240 --> 02:55:25,040
Well, I wanna do but have opinions, okay?

4083
02:55:25,060 --> 02:55:27,600
You made 100k and you're complaining?

4084
02:55:28,160 --> 02:55:28,720
You know what?

4085
02:55:28,920 --> 02:55:30,760
George Bush, I don't like that guy.

4086
02:55:30,860 --> 02:55:31,440
You know what?

4087
02:55:31,560 --> 02:55:32,680
And I don't like Obama either.

4088
02:55:33,420 --> 02:55:33,900
There it is.

4089
02:55:33,900 --> 02:55:34,800
And I'm an old woman.

4090
02:55:34,880 --> 02:55:36,000
I can say whatever I want.

4091
02:55:36,360 --> 02:55:36,760
Frick.

4092
02:55:37,320 --> 02:55:38,020
I don't know, man.

4093
02:55:38,460 --> 02:55:39,440
She is retired.

4094
02:55:39,940 --> 02:55:41,840
And somehow her vote still counts.

4095
02:55:42,140 --> 02:55:42,880
We're still here.

4096
02:55:42,880 --> 02:55:43,060
You know what?

4097
02:55:43,340 --> 02:55:43,780
The bad thing?

4098
02:55:43,840 --> 02:55:45,000
Economy is out of hand.

4099
02:55:45,960 --> 02:55:46,540
You're 89!

4100
02:55:46,540 --> 02:55:47,320
We're still here?

4101
02:55:47,540 --> 02:55:48,660
Oh, thank God.

4102
02:55:49,140 --> 02:55:51,740
I'm just happy somebody else got taxed.

4103
02:55:54,940 --> 02:55:55,980
I can't.

4104
02:55:56,020 --> 02:55:56,860
I'm so happy.

4105
02:55:57,140 --> 02:55:57,960
I'm not alone.

4106
02:55:58,620 --> 02:56:01,180
Someone else is actually paying the government's taxes.

4107
02:56:02,940 --> 02:56:03,960
Where am I at?

4108
02:56:04,760 --> 02:56:08,340
I'm literally paying for Fillion's retirement right now with my taxes.

4109
02:56:08,960 --> 02:56:09,680
Thank you.

4110
02:56:09,780 --> 02:56:11,260
I'm paying for her care home service.

4111
02:56:13,380 --> 02:56:15,440
You should pay for her euthanasia.

4112
02:56:15,820 --> 02:56:16,160
Thank God.

4113
02:56:17,060 --> 02:56:17,940
Thank God.

4114
02:56:18,800 --> 02:56:19,860
I'm out of here.

4115
02:56:20,200 --> 02:56:20,400
Goodbye.

4116
02:56:20,400 --> 02:56:21,480
Does anyone want to race Crocodile with me?

4117
02:56:21,720 --> 02:56:22,240
I fucking...

4118
02:56:23,100 --> 02:56:24,100
Oh my God.

4119
02:56:24,480 --> 02:56:24,900
No way!

4120
02:56:25,600 --> 02:56:27,460
I prefer the road.

4121
02:56:27,620 --> 02:56:28,700
No way, bro!

4122
02:56:28,700 --> 02:56:29,820
Oh my God.

4123
02:56:29,820 --> 02:56:31,000
Race that and another thing!

4124
02:56:33,980 --> 02:56:36,040
We gotta extend Fillion's life.

4125
02:56:36,420 --> 02:56:37,460
Bro, what is happening?

4126
02:56:38,180 --> 02:56:41,480
I feel like the game is just going way too far for me.

4127
02:56:42,580 --> 02:56:43,420
I love the government.

4128
02:56:44,020 --> 02:56:45,200
I love free healthcare.

4129
02:56:47,300 --> 02:56:48,380
Guess one.

4130
02:56:51,880 --> 02:56:52,360
Not bad.

4131
02:56:52,840 --> 02:56:55,980
Wait, how come someone says choose three and someone doesn't let you choose one?

4132
02:56:56,340 --> 02:56:56,500
Yeah.

4133
02:56:56,500 --> 02:56:59,000
Three is before you make it to the end.

4134
02:56:59,160 --> 02:57:02,220
So when you retire, you can only choose one envelope.

4135
02:57:02,720 --> 02:57:03,880
Oh, I see.

4136
02:57:04,860 --> 02:57:07,560
I love paying for other people's free healthcare, guys.

4137
02:57:07,700 --> 02:57:08,220
Thank you.

4138
02:57:09,440 --> 02:57:10,720
Can I get a wheelchair?

4139
02:57:13,280 --> 02:57:15,200
I don't need to help you, Fillion.

4140
02:57:15,920 --> 02:57:18,240
You never helped us in your lifetime.

4141
02:57:18,600 --> 02:57:21,960
Why do I help this boomy?

4142
02:57:24,220 --> 02:57:25,240
Oh, thank God.

4143
02:57:25,340 --> 02:57:28,100
Somebody finally landed on my face.

4144
02:57:28,440 --> 02:57:29,160
Don't tax.

4145
02:57:29,740 --> 02:57:30,700
Oh, thank God.

4146
02:57:32,740 --> 02:57:33,040
No.

4147
02:57:33,380 --> 02:57:34,140
Oh, she left the game.

4148
02:57:34,300 --> 02:57:34,640
Very cool.

4149
02:57:35,120 --> 02:57:36,020
Oh my God.

4150
02:57:36,800 --> 02:57:37,880
Guys, watch this.

4151
02:57:38,040 --> 02:57:39,700
My favorite color is black.

4152
02:57:40,400 --> 02:57:40,900
Here it is.

4153
02:57:41,640 --> 02:57:42,240
Here it comes.

4154
02:57:46,220 --> 02:57:47,320
I'm a two millionaire.

4155
02:57:47,540 --> 02:57:47,880
Holy frick.

4156
02:57:47,920 --> 02:57:50,760
She has not paid a single tax, by the way.

4157
02:57:50,760 --> 02:57:53,140
I hope you get audited.

4158
02:57:55,060 --> 02:57:56,740
Three lifetimes on a single tax.

4159
02:57:56,920 --> 02:57:58,100
I hope you get audited.

4160
02:58:02,420 --> 02:58:05,820
You dare attack my entire society?

4161
02:58:06,180 --> 02:58:06,540
Yes.

4162
02:58:06,960 --> 02:58:08,360
I literally paid for your healthcare.

4163
02:58:12,300 --> 02:58:13,780
Come in here and fight me then.

4164
02:58:14,160 --> 02:58:14,460
Alright.

4165
02:58:15,380 --> 02:58:17,520
All we have to do is push you over, old lady.

4166
02:58:17,540 --> 02:58:18,800
I got in, I get the 10k.

4167
02:58:18,880 --> 02:58:19,740
Alright, that's fine.

4168
02:58:20,760 --> 02:58:21,360
That's fine.

4169
02:58:22,000 --> 02:58:23,820
Oh my God, it would be a shame.

4170
02:58:24,180 --> 02:58:25,240
There was an...

4171
02:58:25,240 --> 02:58:29,440
It would be a shame if there was a window over there in the retirement home.

4172
02:58:29,540 --> 02:58:30,220
There would be a shame.

4173
02:58:30,480 --> 02:58:30,780
My pension.

4174
02:58:32,700 --> 02:58:33,660
Let's go.

4175
02:58:34,560 --> 02:58:36,000
And just like that.

4176
02:58:38,940 --> 02:58:40,220
Am I the last one left?

4177
02:58:40,760 --> 02:58:41,740
Just you, Doobie.

4178
02:58:42,340 --> 02:58:42,920
Just Doobie.

4179
02:58:46,260 --> 02:58:47,940
Wait, I think you made it.

4180
02:58:48,020 --> 02:58:48,540
You make it.

4181
02:58:48,600 --> 02:58:48,940
Yeah.

4182
02:58:48,940 --> 02:58:49,120
Yeah.

4183
02:58:51,800 --> 02:58:53,280
You get to spin, right?

4184
02:58:53,720 --> 02:58:54,140
Once?

4185
02:58:54,340 --> 02:58:54,660
Again?

4186
02:58:55,240 --> 02:58:55,860
Yeah, you get to roll.

4187
02:58:55,860 --> 02:58:56,880
Yeah, we all get to roll.

4188
02:58:57,220 --> 02:58:57,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4189
02:58:59,260 --> 02:59:01,380
Wait, that's a 100k profit.

4190
02:59:02,060 --> 02:59:02,480
Finally!

4191
02:59:03,320 --> 02:59:04,840
I made it to the Millionaire's Club.

4192
02:59:05,280 --> 02:59:05,520
Yeah!

4193
02:59:06,080 --> 02:59:07,140
You got the Millionaire's Club.

4194
02:59:09,000 --> 02:59:11,240
I literally have no idea who's going to win this.

4195
02:59:11,520 --> 02:59:14,660
Fucking, oh yeah, the two millionaire doesn't know who's going to win.

4196
02:59:14,980 --> 02:59:15,780
Well, no, I don't.

4197
02:59:15,840 --> 02:59:17,280
She literally has 120.

4198
02:59:17,280 --> 02:59:19,720
You're literally two million!

4199
02:59:20,260 --> 02:59:23,240
No, she's got the hearts and the piggy banks.

4200
02:59:23,380 --> 02:59:24,340
They don't matter!

4201
02:59:24,620 --> 02:59:25,300
Money matters a lot!

4202
02:59:25,300 --> 02:59:26,340
They matter a lot!

4203
02:59:29,400 --> 02:59:31,480
Oh boy, I wonder who's going to win.

4204
02:59:31,580 --> 02:59:32,020
Wow.

4205
02:59:33,040 --> 02:59:35,120
Who hit two million this game?

4206
02:59:35,380 --> 02:59:39,020
Like, legitimately, Doobie's going to win from all the extra junk she's got.

4207
02:59:39,340 --> 02:59:41,200
Ooh, a mean feeling went off.

4208
02:59:41,260 --> 02:59:42,340
I didn't even get anything.

4209
02:59:42,880 --> 02:59:46,360
You did get the, you got the two bonuses for like, yeah.

4210
02:59:46,360 --> 02:59:47,140
Damn!

4211
02:59:47,240 --> 02:59:48,140
Look, she's going to win!

4212
02:59:48,220 --> 02:59:48,980
Doobie's going to win!

4213
02:59:49,180 --> 02:59:51,960
I don't think she's going to hit two million from this.

4214
02:59:52,060 --> 02:59:52,760
It's impossible.

4215
02:59:54,140 --> 02:59:56,060
Oh, Doki won!

4216
02:59:56,420 --> 02:59:57,440
Wait, what?

4217
02:59:57,940 --> 02:59:58,300
Wait.

4218
02:59:58,700 --> 02:59:59,640
No way!

4219
03:00:00,380 --> 03:00:00,780
No way!

4220
03:00:00,780 --> 03:00:01,800
No way!

4221
03:00:01,800 --> 03:00:02,600
No way!

4222
03:00:02,640 --> 03:00:02,720
No way!

4223
03:00:03,920 --> 03:00:04,580
No way!

4224
03:00:04,780 --> 03:00:05,180
No way!

4225
03:00:08,300 --> 03:00:09,340
No way!

4226
03:00:09,340 --> 03:00:11,100
You guys both got first.

4227
03:00:11,240 --> 03:00:12,280
You guys both win.

4228
03:00:12,360 --> 03:00:14,560
Oh my god, there's no way.

4229
03:00:15,340 --> 03:00:20,260
To be fair, if I didn't have to pay all those taxes, I actually could have won.

4230
03:00:21,040 --> 03:00:26,800
To be fair, Doobie, if I hadn't taken your 100k at the start, I would have lost.

4231
03:00:27,580 --> 03:00:30,720
I literally lost 50% of my income there.

4232
03:00:31,580 --> 03:00:32,460
Holy frick.

4233
03:00:32,680 --> 03:00:33,240
What happens now?

4234
03:00:33,240 --> 03:00:33,840
Look at these losers.

4235
03:00:34,120 --> 03:00:35,260
Doki, do you want to settle this?

4236
03:00:35,980 --> 03:00:36,320
Fine.

4237
03:00:36,920 --> 03:00:37,740
There can only be one.

4238
03:00:37,820 --> 03:00:38,380
Here's what I'm going to do.

4239
03:00:38,380 --> 03:00:42,720
Okay, Bao or Doobie, who wants to be the one that picks either the number one or two?

4240
03:00:43,520 --> 03:00:44,980
Yeah, I'm going to play rock, paper, scissors.

4241
03:00:45,140 --> 03:00:45,460
Frick that.

4242
03:00:45,460 --> 03:00:47,080
How do we play rock, paper, scissors?

4243
03:00:47,320 --> 03:00:47,740
I'm 2D.

4244
03:00:48,320 --> 03:00:52,140
We'll have Bao say rock, paper, scissors, shoot, and then we'll say either scissors or rock or paper.

4245
03:00:53,000 --> 03:00:55,580
Oh my god, Doobie, what happened to you, Doobie?

4246
03:00:56,820 --> 03:00:57,540
You're pixelated.

4247
03:00:58,420 --> 03:01:03,040
How about you guys ask Doobie to think of a number between one to a hundred.

4248
03:01:03,540 --> 03:01:04,760
The one that's closest wins.

4249
03:01:05,240 --> 03:01:05,920
But then she can lie.

4250
03:01:07,300 --> 03:01:07,980
No, she won't.

4251
03:01:07,980 --> 03:01:09,960
I already picked a number.

4252
03:01:10,500 --> 03:01:10,960
Fifty.

4253
03:01:11,560 --> 03:01:11,840
Yeah.

4254
03:01:12,420 --> 03:01:13,640
Wow, you're so cool.

4255
03:01:15,540 --> 03:01:16,220
Fine then.

4256
03:01:16,400 --> 03:01:17,320
Get these nuts in your mouth.

4257
03:01:17,460 --> 03:01:20,360
Let me take a over or under chat.

4258
03:01:21,140 --> 03:01:25,140
Doobie, is she a 69 kind of girl or is she a number one kind of girl?

4259
03:01:25,280 --> 03:01:25,820
Let's find out.

4260
03:01:26,060 --> 03:01:27,940
I'm going to say 51.

4261
03:01:29,360 --> 03:01:30,980
Okay, the number was 94.

4262
03:01:32,120 --> 03:01:32,580
No!

4263
03:01:33,500 --> 03:01:34,420
Number one?

4264
03:01:35,840 --> 03:01:37,260
Oh my god.

4265
03:01:37,260 --> 03:01:38,900
Oh my god.

4266
03:01:38,900 --> 03:01:42,560
Oh my god, you could have lied, Doobie.

4267
03:01:42,800 --> 03:01:44,360
She already has everything.

4268
03:01:45,200 --> 03:01:45,920
Sorry.

4269
03:01:48,400 --> 03:01:50,240
You guys both won.

4270
03:01:50,360 --> 03:01:51,080
Come on.

4271
03:01:51,660 --> 03:01:53,560
We're all winners here.

4272
03:01:53,820 --> 03:01:54,140
You're right.

4273
03:01:54,340 --> 03:01:55,660
We're all winners.

4274
03:01:56,200 --> 03:01:57,460
We're all winners.

4275
03:01:57,680 --> 03:01:59,380
Nobody lied.

4276
03:01:59,960 --> 03:02:00,820
It's a game.

4277
03:02:00,980 --> 03:02:03,240
We all learned that going to college was important.

4278
03:02:03,740 --> 03:02:04,660
So, congratulations.

4279
03:02:04,660 --> 03:02:05,420
Yay!

4280
03:02:06,860 --> 03:02:09,840
The chat was like, of course, the tax evader won.

4281
03:02:12,620 --> 03:02:15,720
It was only three lifetimes of tax evading.

4282
03:02:15,880 --> 03:02:16,840
It wasn't that crazy.

4283
03:02:17,360 --> 03:02:17,860
Oh, yeah.

4284
03:02:17,960 --> 03:02:20,280
I paid for your healthcare, fillion.

4285
03:02:22,160 --> 03:02:23,900
It was only three lifetimes.

4286
03:02:24,460 --> 03:02:26,360
Like, it could definitely have been worse for sure.

4287
03:02:26,600 --> 03:02:28,680
So, I mean, that's just my personal opinion on it.

4288
03:02:30,240 --> 03:02:30,760
Horrible.

4289
03:02:31,400 --> 03:02:32,320
GGs, everybody.

4290
03:02:32,420 --> 03:02:33,260
Have a fun time.

4291
03:02:33,780 --> 03:02:35,140
That was a really fun game.

4292
03:02:36,440 --> 03:02:36,560
Yeah.

4293
03:02:36,560 --> 03:02:37,540
Yeah, I've never played that game before.

4294
03:02:37,640 --> 03:02:37,940
It's alright.

4295
03:02:39,160 --> 03:02:43,240
The only issue is that even with different maps, the cards...

4296
03:02:43,240 --> 03:02:45,100
I wish the cards were different for different maps.

4297
03:02:45,440 --> 03:02:46,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4298
03:02:46,240 --> 03:02:47,680
Yeah, at least the jobs were different.

4299
03:02:48,360 --> 03:02:49,140
Yeah, yeah.

4300
03:02:49,300 --> 03:02:50,180
But that was fun.

4301
03:02:50,460 --> 03:02:51,500
GGs, everybody.

4302
03:02:51,880 --> 03:02:52,280
GGs.

4303
03:02:53,200 --> 03:02:55,200
Yeah, it was great collabing with all of you.

4304
03:02:55,740 --> 03:02:56,740
Yeah, it was really fun.

4305
03:02:56,820 --> 03:02:57,260
Thank you.

4306
03:02:57,420 --> 03:02:57,780
Yeah.

4307
03:02:58,180 --> 03:02:59,220
Thank you, guys.

4308
03:02:59,520 --> 03:03:00,200
Thank you.

4309
03:03:00,500 --> 03:03:02,160
Go follow everybody, Chad.

4310
03:03:02,220 --> 03:03:02,620
Yeah.

4311
03:03:02,620 --> 03:03:06,100
Follow Doobie, Bow, and Fillion.

4312
03:03:07,860 --> 03:03:08,380
Yeah.

4313
03:03:08,500 --> 03:03:09,020
Yay.

4314
03:03:10,700 --> 03:03:15,320
Yeah, I'm gonna talk to my chat a little bit, but thank you for playing.

4315
03:03:16,020 --> 03:03:17,060
Thank you.

4316
03:03:17,220 --> 03:03:18,360
Let's get out of here, y'all.

4317
03:03:18,540 --> 03:03:19,120
Bye-bye.

4318
03:03:19,640 --> 03:03:20,540
Bye-bye, guys.

4319
03:03:21,500 --> 03:03:23,080
It was lovely to meet you, Doobie.

4320
03:03:23,240 --> 03:03:24,240
Bye, Doobie Bow.

4321
03:03:24,620 --> 03:03:25,100
Yeah.

4322
03:03:25,100 --> 03:03:25,500
Bye, guys.

4323
03:03:26,320 --> 03:03:26,880
Bye-bye.

4324
03:03:26,880 --> 03:03:28,000
Bye -bye.

4325
03:03:31,100 --> 03:03:33,540
Wow, that was fun, everyone.

4326
03:03:33,800 --> 03:03:34,300
That was fun.

4327
03:03:34,420 --> 03:03:41,540
I had a great time with Doobie, Bow, and Fillion.

4328
03:03:42,820 --> 03:03:44,420
And I had a great time.

4329
03:03:44,660 --> 03:03:50,260
I can't believe how fucking unlucky I am with the government.

4330
03:03:50,620 --> 03:03:51,840
I love the government.

4331
03:03:54,640 --> 03:03:57,800
I love the government so much.

4332
03:04:00,920 --> 03:04:04,240
But it was incredibly fun playing with all of them.

4333
03:04:04,620 --> 03:04:09,840
And I feel like I think I got taxed at least three times a turn, so yippee.

4334
03:04:13,340 --> 03:04:17,200
That's when you know I actually pay my taxes.

4335
03:04:19,660 --> 03:04:21,340
But thank you, everyone, for coming.

4336
03:04:21,340 --> 03:04:23,680
I hope you guys had a great time watching.

4337
03:04:24,280 --> 03:04:27,340
I am going to rest now because I'm still sick.

4338
03:04:27,560 --> 03:04:31,420
So if you guys didn't know, I have a Gamer Subs!

4339
03:04:31,880 --> 03:04:32,620
Gamer Subs!

4340
03:04:32,740 --> 03:04:37,340
My Gamer Subs thing dropped, so make sure to use my code DokiBird.

4341
03:04:37,520 --> 03:04:38,780
It's on the...

4342
03:04:38,780 --> 03:04:39,880
I pinned it in my chat.

4343
03:04:39,980 --> 03:04:41,520
Support the Gamer Subs thing.

4344
03:04:41,760 --> 03:04:42,240
Yippee.

4345
03:04:42,580 --> 03:04:44,160
I have like a million things to show.

4346
03:04:44,500 --> 03:04:46,180
I have a Hyatt PC case.

4347
03:04:46,540 --> 03:04:47,640
I have my concert.

4348
03:04:47,800 --> 03:04:48,540
Bye, you guys.

4349
03:04:48,600 --> 03:04:51,320
If you guys didn't know, Doobie's going to be in my concert.

4350
03:04:51,320 --> 03:04:52,780
With Mint for 3D.

4351
03:04:53,040 --> 03:04:54,540
So check it out, too.

4352
03:04:55,420 --> 03:04:59,600
Check out the concert in December 14th.

4353
03:04:59,660 --> 03:05:00,260
So yeah.

4354
03:05:01,200 --> 03:05:01,960
There's that.

4355
03:05:02,040 --> 03:05:03,040
Doobie's going to be there.

4356
03:05:04,240 --> 03:05:04,720
And...

4357
03:05:05,400 --> 03:05:06,200
What else?

4358
03:05:06,440 --> 03:05:06,740
The initial.

4359
03:05:07,040 --> 03:05:07,400
Oh, yeah.

4360
03:05:07,540 --> 03:05:09,340
Vote for me in the streamer awards.

4361
03:05:10,460 --> 03:05:11,140
And I think that's it.

4362
03:05:11,200 --> 03:05:12,040
Is that really...

4363
03:05:13,480 --> 03:05:15,000
I'm so good at shitting.

4364
03:05:16,700 --> 03:05:20,340
And tomorrow, I'm going to be announcing the teams for my Apex custom.

4365
03:05:20,340 --> 03:05:21,280
Yay!

4366
03:05:22,700 --> 03:05:27,280
I'm going to be announcing the events and the rules for my Apex custom I'm organizing.

4367
03:05:28,240 --> 03:05:32,020
And be sure to check that one out as well.

4368
03:05:32,180 --> 03:05:33,980
For tomorrow at 6pm PST.

4369
03:05:34,520 --> 03:05:38,940
That custom has been the most hellish thing I've ever organized.

4370
03:05:39,180 --> 03:05:42,100
I've had so many setbacks regarding it.

4371
03:05:42,240 --> 03:05:43,320
It's just very unlucky.

4372
03:05:44,300 --> 03:05:48,280
And even now, I have last minute shit that came up.

4373
03:05:48,380 --> 03:05:50,320
So I'm scrambling right now.

4374
03:05:52,420 --> 03:05:55,900
There's so many logistic things that came up.

4375
03:05:56,020 --> 03:05:59,400
And I have to negotiate stuff regarding things, regarding the custom.

4376
03:06:00,060 --> 03:06:03,340
And it's the most hellish thing I've ever organized.

4377
03:06:04,000 --> 03:06:08,540
I've never hit as many roadblocks for this Apex custom.

4378
03:06:10,500 --> 03:06:15,080
I've never had so many roadblocks for an event I've organized until now.

4379
03:06:15,140 --> 03:06:16,760
This is the most roadblocks I've ever hit.

4380
03:06:16,760 --> 03:06:18,660
And so I'm like, oh my god.

4381
03:06:18,660 --> 03:06:20,320
It's actually been so stressful.

4382
03:06:20,480 --> 03:06:22,980
But I hope everything comes together by next week.

4383
03:06:23,060 --> 03:06:24,440
But anyway, by tomorrow!

4384
03:06:24,580 --> 03:06:25,920
Because I'm announcing it tomorrow.

4385
03:06:26,340 --> 03:06:30,440
Anyway, I'm going to head off now.

4386
03:06:32,360 --> 03:06:33,360
Fucking words are hard.

4387
03:06:34,380 --> 03:06:36,040
As always, stay hydrated.

4388
03:06:36,220 --> 03:06:36,740
Posture check.

4389
03:06:36,820 --> 03:06:38,420
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

4390
03:06:38,520 --> 03:06:40,040
And if you stay up for me, head to bed.

4391
03:06:40,100 --> 03:06:41,260
Because you deserve it.

4392
03:06:41,340 --> 03:06:42,620
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

4393
03:06:43,000 --> 03:06:43,800
Bye, guys.

4394
03:06:43,800 --> 03:06:44,520
Bye.
