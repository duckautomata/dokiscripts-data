All right, there's you.

22
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,400

So, hello, everybody.

24
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:09,120

26
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:13,960
Am I not too loud?

27
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,340
I don't know, actually.

28
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,980
Your mic is like, you're like in a very empty room.

29
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:19,880
That's what...

30
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:24,260
Your room has definitely has no soundproofing done.

31
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,000
My mic has four things.

32
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,740
It has the Olympic circle thingy.

33
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:32,740
What the fuck does that mean?

34
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,300
It has just a circle.

35
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,380
It has something that looks like a fortune cookie.

36
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,660
Oh, wait, do you have a blue Yeti?

37
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:41,960
Yeah.

38
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,860
Okay, yeah, I was gonna say that sounds like a blue Yeti
shit right there.

39
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,320
So what do I do?

40
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:50,920
Fortune cookie, a circle, or the Olympic thing?

41
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,160
Sound people, what should he do?

00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,040
I, okay.

43
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,880
I'm not like a sound person.

44
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,580
What the fuck are you?

45
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,260
Why would I know this?

46
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:03,340
It seems like you're a streamer I thought I thought I
thought you know.

47
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:11,020
Yeah, I'm a streamer that outsources to other people on
things that I don't know Like sounds being one of them.

48
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,800

49
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,860

about sound?

Oh, no.

71
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,280
Don't worry.

72
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,220
I was spreading misinformation earlier, guys.

73
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:24,860
Don't put this on any eSport report.

74
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:31,660
news that a VTuber just exposed pay a roll.

75
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:35,460
Guys, it was just a joke.

76
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:36,180
I swear.

77
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,740
I am so warmed up.

78
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,560
Now I can't wait to not hit any of these shots in the actual
game.

79
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,380
It's like, it's like Wigs that's such a long interview.

80
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:54,060
I think so.

81
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:56,500
Where's Oh my god.

82
00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:08,900
I like how like Whig is like The name of the tournament But
Greek is Cassie Wait Greek is Cassie Yeah Yeah Wait isn't he

83
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:09,440
Is he playing?

84
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,500
Wait Oh Why the fuck did it say Greek?

85
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:24,160
Oh it says geek lounge I thought that said Greek That would
be so funny though Okay got it That would have been so funny

86
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:33,200
though if like greek was the one casting it i should have
casted it he should have casted it you should have it would

87
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:41,080
have been so funny it would have been really funny also guys
how is um how was tempo should i raise him up or should i

88
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:47,740
keep him this volume i don't know if sound guy is awake
right now i'm still in the bathroom so it's okay yeah tempo

89
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:54,400
sounds good playing from the toilet yeah he is so we do
pretty badly to be fair there's a lot of things against us

90
00:08:54,400 --> 00:09:04,740
right now um we're worried that we're in the list of teams
that's not it uh it's an announcement i think guys i just

91
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:10,780
want you guys to know um i'm gonna talk about this again
when wick joins us but like um our team technically consists

92
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:18,980
of two plat players and a gold player because wait temple
you're gold right who's the gold player i'm in plat you're

93
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:25,180
in plat oh three plat wait no is wiggin gold or plat we said
he was in plat it's three plat players oh it's three plat

94
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:34,860
players okay it's okay I put two plats in the golds for to
increase engagement okay wiggin's the gold right it looks

95
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:43,960
better when I have a gold in my title because people are
like whoa and a gold player um but let me go derank myself

96
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:51,680
here yeah I mean that would be easy where am I actually I'm
very close to derank Okay, it's full of views.

97
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:56,000
Anyway, um, so our team technically consists of three plat
players.

98
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:59,000
And, um, the thing is that...

99
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:09,460
If you guys watch the drafting stage on Wing Stream, um, I
was on the list and it listed me as plat 4.

100
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,460
Because technically...

101
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:18,440
Technically, I had plat 4 as Doki Bird.

102
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:38,300
so so i was listed as platform so no one so like people were
like who the fuck is this platform shitter um yeah so i

103
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:42,920
committed the greatest heist of all time convincing staff i
was platform

104
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:55,980
i did say no i did right i was like oh masters but i play
like a plat player so that's why i literally said okay the

105
00:10:55,980 --> 00:11:05,480
reason why i was in platform was because they were like
what's your rank and i was like well i got masters in the

106
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:14,440
last was it five seasons but i played like a plat player and
then they're like okay give us your like tracker thing And

107
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:18,660
apparently the tracker lists your average rank overall.

108
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:23,960
And my average rank overall as Doki is Platte.

109
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,280
I got away with it.

110
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:31,800
Yeah!

111
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,780
I can't believe it.

112
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:37,660
How does she keep getting away with this?

113
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:40,100
How does she keep doing this?

114
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,460
Oh my god.

115
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,260
It's so fucking crazy.

116
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:50,800
Somebody stop her!

117
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:52,920
Change the badges.

118
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:53,740
Oh, don't worry.

119
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:54,520
Don't worry, guys.

120
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,060

194
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:58,580
We did so much to read the ring.

195
00:16:58,740 --> 00:16:59,700
I mean, no, I agree.

196
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:00,840

Yeah, you're right.

00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:02,300
I know who's up.

200
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,480
And we're starting up on World's Edge.

201
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,500
So I put Geyser.

202
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:05,500
So we're Geyser.

203
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,160
I'm sorry.

204
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:08,940
That's not the best POI.

205
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:09,360
We have.

206
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,980
You gave us Geyser?

207
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,080
I don't.

208
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:12,520
I know.

209
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:12,940
I panic.

210
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,340
You gave us Geyser.

211
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,640
You're literally the fucking headliner.

212
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:19,060
You can request for any fucking POI.

213
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:26,460
And then we have tempo that can kick off any pro player off
the scrims if they try to contest us.

214
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,180
I know, I got scared.

215
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:31,480
I said abuse your power, not be a bitch.

216
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,060
Oh, but I'm always a bitch, man.

217
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,140
I'm always a bitch, bro.

218
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,700
Oh, I was always a bitch.

219
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:39,940
What happened to you, man?

220
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:40,800
What happened?

221
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,840
I've been this way.

222
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,440
What happened?

223
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,640
We had to go back to childhood.

224
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:45,240
I don't know.

225
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:45,940
What?

226
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,700
I was so emotional trauma.

227
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:48,100

day and said the No, the loot tick is the thing.

234
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:50,820
The cargo bot.

235
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:51,780
Yeah.

236
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,000
The loot tick is the thing with the legs.

237
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:54,940
Yeah.

238
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:56,180
Yeah.

239
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:56,900
Yeah.

240
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,900
But he said the ball thingies.

241
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:05,980
You know, he said as if it's like something we fucking take
like a fucking the towers.

242
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,200
Oh my God.

243
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:09,480
Okay.

244
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,520
The lobby's open.

245
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,260
I'm heading in.

246
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,720
We're gonna we're gonna cycle.

247
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:14,620
Not bottom five.

248
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:18,080
I'm actually not gonna use charge rifle and no one will no
one will run out of it.

249
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:29,100
i'm running bomba for sure let's go okay how good are you
with the sentinel bro can we just run three snipers and just

250
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:36,520
go somewhere high and then just try and snipe people and get
kills that way and just make everyone angry okay we just we

251
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:45,160
the way to get to that area is that we have to make sure we
don't die to travel there first that's the we have to make

252
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:50,880
sure no valk is going to be our crutch here we're we have no
Remember, we need three Evac Towers.

253
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:54,700
Well, last time we played, well, actually, no, we didn't
play.

254
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:57,980
But last time, you know, that's when you were in Tempo
played.

255
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:03,520
Yeah, I would say that we had Valk because we literally
needed it.

256
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:04,900
Now we don't have it.

257
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,280
But no one else has Valk, too.

258
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,020
Without Valk or an Evac Tower.

259
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,820
Okay, so at this point, we just got to hope RNG our way.

260
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:15,140
Wait, wait, wait, you have connections to staff, right?

261
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:16,100
Can they...

262
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,480
towers in front of us.

263
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:19,540
Yeah.

264
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,680
Like, like, like, like my chat.

265
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:26,780
A Greek just came to my room and said, if tempo kills me,
I'm pulling the fucking ethernet cable.

266
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,720
So tempo, if you kill him, bro, my internet goes out.

267
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,920
Just know where his internet goes out too.

268
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,180
He fucks over his phone.

269
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:35,220
No, he just gotta come in mine and pull mine.

270
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,720
But he's a wait, what?

271
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:39,180
But you can go over to his room and pull his as well.

272
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:41,380
Yeah, I can't pull out.

273
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,960
I can't pull out how's internet.

274
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:43,480
There is peace.

275
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:44,540
You can pull.

276
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:47,040
And how tell how tell how.

277
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:47,840

how much you want to bet i'll bet you a second blended

295
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:39,330

on that you didn't do it either i was waiting for you i was

296
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:42,730
waiting for you technically i'm not i'm free from that
already

297
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:46,790
Oh no.

298
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:50,810
And technically, I'll prove Dokey Bird didn't promise.

299
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:53,910
Dokey Bird didn't promise a blended subway.

300
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:54,910
I'm just saying.

301
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:57,770
I'll give you five subs that Tebow gets.

302
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,810
Well, actually, how many kills though?

303
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:00,350
You know what I mean?

304
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:00,950
Like how many kills?

305
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:02,930
That's how much you believe in them.

306
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:03,850
Five subs.

307
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:05,450
That's how much.

308
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:07,890
His life is worth five subs.

309
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:09,370
That's like how many dollars?

310
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:10,770
That's like...

311
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:11,750
Don't gaslight me.

312
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:13,110
You're playing on his downfall.

313
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:14,490
You're saying he's so bad.

314
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:15,650
No, I wouldn't know how much.

315
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:20,550
Unless you believe in him, but clearly you don't believe in
him enough if it's worth five subs.

316
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:21,350
All right.

317
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:22,450
Yeah, you couldn't be more right.

318
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:23,230
100%.

319
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:23,650
Yeah.

320
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:25,210
No offense, Temple.

321
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:25,750
I love your death.

322
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:27,110
I'm like, I'm not going to sit here and sell you.

323
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:28,030
He's gonna get like 10 kills.

324
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:30,490
I think Temple gets like five in six games.

325
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:31,850
I can't believe.

326
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:35,850
I can't believe he's like, if he gets a kill, it's gonna be
on a pro player.

327
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:40,690
So you try to say that his pro player kills aren't even
worth more than one sub per kill.

328
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:43,570
It's not even worth one.

329
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:45,250
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

330
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:52,130
only only allowed legends is fusing mad maggie horizon what
revenant oh they're going they're going revenant okay yeah

331
00:24:52,130 --> 00:25:05,090
yeah yeah okay bro you mean yeah you're trying to say tempo
is worth like 25 and kills correct bro if i had to pay tempo

332
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:11,450
to be on my team for two hours i'd pay him 25 oh what are
the what are the odds someone ends up with negative points

333
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:12,790
today who's to then

334
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:17,990
Wait, say it again?

335
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:18,930
Oh, yeah.

336
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:19,790
Wait, I didn't say that.

337
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:21,030
Who the fuck is that guy?

338
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:21,990
Who the fuck?

339
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:24,830
I don't know who the fuck Silenna is.

340
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:25,690
What a fucking bump.

341
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:27,050
Yeah, I'm Doki.

342
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:29,130
Yeah, what are you talking about?

343
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:30,770
It's my first time being Doki.

344
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:31,270
Yeah.

345
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:32,430
Yeah.

346
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:33,650
Okay, five subs.

347
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:34,070
Okay.

348
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,590
Tempo does, wait, wait.

349
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:37,250
What was the deal?

350
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:40,050
If Tempo gets, like, a one kill, it's five subs.

351
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:41,450
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

352
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:42,230
You're making.

353
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:42,510
Holy shit.

354
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:43,230
I'm so.

355
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:44,990
Wait, one kill, five subs?

356
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:45,570
Yeah.

357
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:47,130
No, no, don't keep me.

358
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:47,870
I didn't say that.

359
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:49,570
I can get a hundred subs here.

360
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:50,510
Yeah, okay, okay.

361
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:57,010
If Tempo gets one kill, you have to gift me and Tempo five
subs each.

362
00:25:58,910 --> 00:25:59,650
Oh, my God.

363
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:02,090
Imagine, imagine Destroyer actually gets in his lobby.

364
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:05,230
Also, like, also if he doesn't, you have to gift me five
subs.

365
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:07,910
All right, down.

366
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:08,870
That's why I'll deal.

367
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:09,310
Okay.

368
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:10,010
Deal.

369
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:10,390
All right.

370
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:11,130
Deal.

371
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:13,790
I don't know how I always get routed in these things with
you, but it just matters.

372
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:14,230
It's fine.

373
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:14,770
Yeah.

374
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:16,510
No, you didn't.

375
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:17,890
Of course you did it.

376
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:18,850
You do it every time.

377
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:19,710
You're so good at it.

378
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,010
Because you're such a little bitch.

379
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:25,610

00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:42,340
There's no armors left on the floor because I don't think we
were ever going to find armors in Geyser.

436
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:45,060
No, we were probably going to get just triple white anyway.

437
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:45,700
Yeah.

438
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:47,480
There's no difference now.

439
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:50,000
The Geyser's like...

440
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:50,760
Yeah, it's pretty bad.

441
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:51,920

Are they in the building?

489
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:09,280

490
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:10,900

We're gonna keep moving.

512

Wait, wait, wait, wait.

602
00:38:56,730 --> 00:38:58,010

608
00:39:03,570 --> 00:39:03,610
He's running away.

609
00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:03,910
He's running away.

610
00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:04,370
Hit the beacon.

611
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:04,830
Hit the beacon.

612
00:39:04,830 --> 00:39:05,610
Okay, okay, okay.

613
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:06,950
I got really scared.

614
00:39:07,290 --> 00:39:07,850
I got really scared.

615
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:10,510
Hit the beacon and run back to me immediately because
they're above you.

616
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:11,290
Okay.

617
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:12,730
That is not very, I don't know.

618
00:39:12,770 --> 00:39:13,950
I have a lot of confidence, but here we go.

619
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:14,290
Nope.

620
00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:15,310
One drop down.

621
00:39:15,310 --> 00:39:16,330
Are you giving me a bit.

622
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:16,510
Are you down?

623
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:17,230
I forget.

624
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:18,830
Oh, my God.

625
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:19,470
She doesn't know.

626
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:19,890
You're good.

627
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:20,550
You're...

628
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:21,690
We're so happy.

629
00:39:21,810 --> 00:39:22,550
I still don't know.

630
00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:23,970
I did not see the chip Check!

631
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:26,730
We need to get underneath, rather.

632
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:27,470
Wait, wait, wait.

633
00:39:28,310 --> 00:39:29,170
We have no evac.

634
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:30,830
We have no kill.

635
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:31,950
You got a full kill.

636
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:33,210
Tempo is the goat.

637
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:34,030
Oh, he keeps up.

638
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:35,310
That's 10 subs each.

639
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:35,750
We need to move.

640
00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:36,070
We need to move.

641
00:39:36,130 --> 00:39:36,390
We need to move.

642
00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:36,710
We need to move.

643
00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:38,810
Okay, that's 10 subs each person!

644
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:39,950

00:39:39,990 --> 00:39:40,950
We're gonna come over here and play this.

646
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:43,370

647
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:44,210
Okay.

648
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:45,810
They're gonna set up your gen right here, Ducky.

649
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:46,610
We're gonna play right here.

650

Okay, right now?

651
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:48,110
Actually, no, don't do it.

652
00:39:48,210 --> 00:39:48,450
Don't do it.

653
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:48,790
Don't do it.

654
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:48,950
Don't do it.

655
00:39:49,350 --> 00:39:50,570
I want to see if we can get an RV.

656
00:39:50,770 --> 00:39:51,950
If there's no one in RV, we should get there underneath.

657
00:39:53,410 --> 00:39:53,730
Tempo.

658
00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:58,330

bridge that we run for RV?

00:42:06,370 --> 00:42:07,150
Don't take this wig.

742
00:42:07,350 --> 00:42:07,950

All right.

750
00:42:15,330 --> 00:42:15,630
Don't worry.

751
00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:17,410
My fences will protect us.

752
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:19,470
All right.

753
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:20,470
We need to get in that corner.

754
00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:21,290
They're fighting on bridge.

755
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:24,290
You guys should go to RV right now.

756
00:42:24,290 --> 00:42:24,610
RV.

757
00:42:25,330 --> 00:42:25,570
Let's go.

758
00:42:25,690 --> 00:42:25,830
Let's go.

759
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:26,390
Go.

760
00:42:28,970 --> 00:42:30,090
They're watching now.

761
00:42:30,330 --> 00:42:31,110
They're watching now.

762
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:33,750
They're in someone's inside.

763
00:42:34,990 --> 00:42:36,070
There's someone inside RV.

764
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:37,250
What do you mean?

765
00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:38,410
He's in the RV.

766
00:42:38,770 --> 00:42:39,270
RV is flesh.

767
00:42:41,610 --> 00:42:43,510
He's dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead!

768
00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:45,310
No, we lost him, but that's okay.

769
00:42:45,570 --> 00:42:46,610
Okay, wait, we have a strat here, though.

770
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:47,030
We have a strat.

771
00:42:47,790 --> 00:42:49,190
We're gonna get in this corner over here, Salon, okay?

772
00:42:49,390 --> 00:42:51,030
You still have your Moby if you loot your body.

773
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:51,530
I didn't loot it.

774
00:42:51,550 --> 00:42:51,870
I didn't loot it.

775
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:55,190
I couldn't loot anything, him.

776
00:42:55,550 --> 00:42:57,110
Wait, does that guy have a body?

777
00:42:57,690 --> 00:42:59,310
No, no, no, no.

778
00:42:59,770 --> 00:43:00,430
No, no, no.

779
00:43:00,730 --> 00:43:01,910
Okay, wait, Salon, we have a play.

780
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:02,390
I'm not even kidding.

781
00:43:02,510 --> 00:43:02,790
We have a play.

782
00:43:03,010 --> 00:43:03,330
Okay.

783
00:43:03,890 --> 00:43:04,810
We're gonna get into this corner.

784
00:43:04,990 --> 00:43:05,090
Come here.

785
00:43:06,190 --> 00:43:06,950
Come, come, come, come, come.

786
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:08,690
Come to me.

787
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:10,390
I don't know if I want to see it.

788
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:12,430
Are you sure?

789
00:43:12,610 --> 00:43:13,350
That's a good placement.

790
00:43:13,810 --> 00:43:13,970
Come here.

791
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:14,190
Come here.

792
00:43:14,270 --> 00:43:14,490
Trust us.

793
00:43:14,690 --> 00:43:14,750
Okay.

794
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:16,510
I might die now because I hesitated.

795
00:43:17,270 --> 00:43:17,710
Oh my God.

796
00:43:18,010 --> 00:43:18,550
Don't be a little bitch.

797
00:43:18,770 --> 00:43:19,170
I hesitated.

798
00:43:19,410 --> 00:43:19,970
I hesitated.

799
00:43:20,310 --> 00:43:20,430
I hesitated.

800
00:43:20,930 --> 00:43:21,910
There's no way.

801
00:43:22,270 --> 00:43:26,070
It didn't matter.

802
00:43:29,570 --> 00:43:30,650
It didn't matter.

803
00:43:30,930 --> 00:43:31,950
There was a full team running back.

804
00:43:31,950 --> 00:43:33,750
But no, they were on the other side of the rock.

805
00:43:33,890 --> 00:43:35,270

833
00:45:22,170 --> 00:45:23,910

This is so...

845
00:45:41,590 --> 00:45:48,950
funny only i think if we had zone in any way we definitely
would have lived longer oh no if we had shown we could have

846
00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:54,870
like went to lava siphon took balloon you know what i mean
yeah we would have been so healthy yeah i wanted to get that

847
00:45:54,870 --> 00:46:02,390
rv pretty bad we got that rv early where we could oh we sort
of lost somebody erinoco he came out of the rv solo bro i

848
00:46:02,390 --> 00:46:10,690
didn't realize anyone was there and i'm just needing the
bridge and then a noco just comes out and then i have to

849
00:46:10,690 --> 00:46:18,070
mark him the guy was so confident that i thought it was a
full team so i went to the side no i mean we did we honestly

850
00:46:18,070 --> 00:46:22,530
did a good job we got in there we killed a good die
realistically i should have got to kill him then he brought

851
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:26,750
it up top too almost one clean way for like a thousand
levels i was crazy probably the only time i'll have a good

852
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:33,490
shot today that's okay this is our peak guys this is the
best gameplay you're gonna see out of all of us this is the

853
00:46:33,490 --> 00:46:41,310
this is the start of the damage we get plus one kill after
every game which means yeah there's no way we can be last

854
00:46:41,310 --> 00:46:47,350
because kills game six there's no way we can be last because
we're we already started out strong with with with kills

855
00:46:47,350 --> 00:46:54,350
yeah no i was hoping i was hoping someone would miss pick a
legend and they'd get minus five and then they'd get like

856
00:46:54,350 --> 00:47:00,270
bottom five and then they just their scoreboard is just
negative anyone miss pick a legend there must have been one

They're already two people over advantage.

865
00:47:22,830 --> 00:47:24,530
It's called survival the fittest.

866
00:47:24,930 --> 00:47:25,950
We were able to.

867
00:47:26,550 --> 00:47:27,870
We were able to connect.

868
00:47:28,070 --> 00:47:31,070
We were able to evolve to what we are.

869
00:47:31,570 --> 00:47:34,030
We're about to, we didn't survive the fittest.

870
00:47:34,030 --> 00:47:36,270
I did not do this tournament so Imperial Howe can make more
money.

He's buying me dinner.

872
00:47:38,070 --> 00:47:39,430
You should have not invited him.

873
00:47:40,890 --> 00:47:41,570

Even if I trusted you and we ran at the same time, we
still...

882
00:48:15,250 --> 00:48:16,430
We would have still died.

883
00:48:16,870 --> 00:48:18,370
Because I got...

884
00:48:18,370 --> 00:48:18,830

994
00:55:23,380 --> 00:55:24,340
I promised you guys like $200 million.

995
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:25,840
That guy.

996
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:31,760
The one that's been like apparently like bronze or whatever
after 10 years of league.

997
00:55:32,260 --> 00:55:34,680
So then he decided to own an esport org.

998
00:55:39,820 --> 00:55:40,900
That guy.

999
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:43,100
It's a good thing we could talk about it.

1000
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:47,120
Yeah, he should be able to openly talk about this, you know?

1001
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:48,040
It's okay, Tempo.

1002
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:49,760
That whole shit is actually great.

1003
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:51,100
Yeah, I'm surprised.

1004
00:55:52,340 --> 00:55:55,860
Like, I'm surprised he got, he almost got away with it.

1005
00:55:56,140 --> 00:55:58,340
Until he got 25 years in prison.

1006
00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:00,460
I don't even know that's enough, though.

1007
00:56:00,460 --> 00:56:01,780
I was like the biggest heist ever.

1008
00:56:02,140 --> 00:56:02,580
Yeah.

1009
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:05,520

And we went for this meddling kids.

00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,160
You're brand new to this.

00:58:48,420 --> 00:58:49,200
Yeah, I'm brand new.

1038
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:52,020
I charge up those sweep in the side of the head for 140.

1039
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:53,960
Good for you.

1040
00:58:54,180 --> 00:58:55,120
You didn't get the kill, though, man.

00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:55,620
What's wrong with you?

1042
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:56,100
I don't know.

1043
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:57,300
I have no idea.

1044
00:58:57,380 --> 00:58:58,300
He typed it, not me.

1045
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:00,300
Also, I thought Tempo, I thought you had it.

1046
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:03,260
the setup already because you were gonna do it on last land.

1047
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:04,180
What happened?

1048
00:59:04,780 --> 00:59:05,620
I didn't buy it.

1049
00:59:05,780 --> 00:59:06,960
I didn't buy the roller coaster thing.

1050
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:08,080
Of course you didn't buy it.

1051
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:09,220
You didn't even buy it?

1052
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:12,760
You literally told me like, oh, TSA won't let me do it.

1053
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:13,900
I have the iPad?

1054
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:15,660

1055
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:17,040
I have the tablet.

1056
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:18,720
I need the rolly thingy with the wheels.

1057
00:59:19,060 --> 00:59:20,040
Ask EA to buy it.

1058
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:21,740
We'll make it off as a business expense.

1059
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:23,300
That is so smart.

1060
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:24,000
That's a good idea.

1061
00:59:24,180 --> 00:59:25,940
We all have good connections with EA staff.

1062
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:27,860
Yeah, let me go talk to Chen.

1063
00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:33,640
Yeah, we can literally convince them because it's an la
instead of like london so it's we don't have to get a plane

1064
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:42,100
we can return it to the respawn h2 exactly and then they can
reuse it every time i want to i want to butt in oh you can

1065
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:50,980
you can play test with the no we cannot roll rolling ipads

pay attention here we might be conned guys we might be kind

1067
00:59:58,300 --> 01:00:01,800

No, we have no beacon.

Wait, isn't...

1074
01:00:08,820 --> 01:00:09,860
We didn't pick a control character.

01:00:10,060 --> 01:00:10,540
We're just rolling.

1076
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:11,960

We did that so bad.

1156
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:32,120
We were in the last game today.

1157
01:05:32,120 --> 01:05:32,780

Of course he is.

1161
01:05:39,860 --> 01:05:40,760
On roof, we're dead here.

1162
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:41,420
We're so dead.

1163
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:42,360
What are we?

1164
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:42,880

You're dead.

1173
01:05:49,980 --> 01:05:53,560
We should've made tempo.

1174
01:05:53,560 --> 01:06:00,760
here too we should have made you on top of the building
tempo yes yeah he was by the way you okay they have no idea

1177
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:16,580
Oh, my.

1178
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:19,400
We got 20th tempo.

1179
01:06:21,220 --> 01:06:21,420
Tempo.

1180
01:06:21,720 --> 01:06:23,160
We got tempo, man.

1181
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:24,860
We're not last.

1182
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:26,640
We're dead center zone.

1183
01:06:27,020 --> 01:06:27,280
Tempo.

1184
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:28,360
Tempo.

1185
01:06:30,840 --> 01:06:32,680
Wait, we're not center zone.

1186
01:06:32,900 --> 01:06:34,920
Oh, Rob's saying that in that zone we were.

1187
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:36,240
Oh, yeah.

1188
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:39,280
Tempo.

1189
01:06:39,580 --> 01:06:41,020
It's the 20th place, bro.

1190
01:06:41,100 --> 01:06:42,460
And no beacon for all.

1191
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:44,580
Again, does this game hate us?

1192
01:06:47,220 --> 01:06:51,540
Okay, what if like in our third game we let tempo that way?

1193
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:54,540
We let tempo go wherever the fuck you want.

1194
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:58,840
No, because no, no, because this next game is Olympus and we
have a good PY.

1195
01:06:59,140 --> 01:06:59,940
We have phase drivers.

1196
01:07:00,220 --> 01:07:01,580
That's what you said about last game.

1197
01:07:01,580 --> 01:07:02,860
We have infinite balls.

1198
01:07:03,020 --> 01:07:03,780
We have infinite balls.

1199
01:07:04,140 --> 01:07:05,200
Infinite, infinite, infinite balls.

1200
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:06,640
Why don't we get contested?

1201
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:07,540
Well, no.

1202
01:07:08,260 --> 01:07:09,480
No, we might get contested.

1203
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:10,200
Yeah, we don't get.

1204
01:07:10,460 --> 01:07:10,560
Yeah.

1205
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:14,940
People see our names like, oh, Timmy is based.

1206
01:07:15,700 --> 01:07:16,480
Oh, fuck.

1207
01:07:16,660 --> 01:07:17,980
We do not want to fight that guy.

1208
01:07:18,380 --> 01:07:20,460
I thought you said we had to do that.

1209
01:07:20,460 --> 01:07:21,560
Hold out of my own tournament, dude.

1210
01:07:21,780 --> 01:07:22,400
What is this shit?

1211
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:24,080
What's going on?

1212
01:07:24,320 --> 01:07:25,100
We go find some.

1213
01:07:26,420 --> 01:07:28,260
Is there anyone that's free, Chappo?

1214
01:07:28,460 --> 01:07:35,060
I can't believe it.

1215
01:07:36,020 --> 01:07:36,620
I was so talented.

1216
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:37,260
Matt.

1217
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:39,460
Super unfortunate.

1218
01:07:40,740 --> 01:07:48,900
Wait, this is why you don't follow your heart i mean why am
i getting contested at command center you followed your

1219
01:07:48,900 --> 01:07:57,560
heart and then we got 20th place command center no beacon
and we're contested my strategy is just fucked out the

1220
01:07:57,560 --> 01:08:01,820
window there because the whole point is i wanted to get
beacon then valkyles come up there so we don't have to shoot

1221
01:08:01,820 --> 01:08:08,040
for the rest of the game you just know exactly where to go
because tempo's sitting on top of roofs

1222
01:08:11,260 --> 01:08:21,500
with his back no no comment with his back very bottom i was
shooting someone yeah but you shot in the back my i was

1223
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:27,520
shooting cascades and then i don't know where those guys
came from and they were in the house next to us all right

1224
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:33,780
we'll see what we got i found a map okay wait did we get
zero points that get a zero point no yes we were 20 wait i

1225
01:08:33,780 --> 01:08:38,160
don't know i wasn't sure if we got to kill i don't know
about work some magic with that charge rifle you know what i

1226
01:08:38,160 --> 01:08:39,000
mean i wasn't sure

1227
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:43,600
No one's good.

1228
01:08:45,140 --> 01:08:46,320
Temba, what's free?

1229
01:08:46,780 --> 01:08:47,620
What's free for the next map?

1230
01:08:47,780 --> 01:08:48,220
We're moving on.

1231
01:08:48,340 --> 01:08:49,120
Memory like a goldfish.

1232
01:08:49,640 --> 01:08:50,240
What's free?

1233
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:53,300
Interesting.

1234
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:54,530
Oh, here it is.

1235
01:08:55,060 --> 01:08:55,400
Next.

1236
01:08:57,140 --> 01:08:57,920
What's free?

1237
01:08:58,160 --> 01:08:59,200
Do we have anything?

1238
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:00,440
Do we...

1239
01:09:00,440 --> 01:09:01,400
Is there...

1240
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:04,400
We should...

1241
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:05,020
If we...

1242
01:09:05,020 --> 01:09:05,680
Oh my god.

1243
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:06,820
I have an idea.

1244
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:08,040
If there's no...

1245
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:12,340
If there's no spot free, we see who's the 20th place team.

1246
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:24,900
And we land on them That's us No, I meant overall Overall
It's not fucked up That's not fucked up No, no, no We're

1247
01:09:24,900 --> 01:09:31,080
Dude, we're weak We're weak on the weaker That's fair as
fuck Yeah, yeah It's strategy It's strategy And people can

1248
01:09:31,080 --> 01:09:37,460
do that In pro league And fuck over other teams We can too
Yeah, that's Cause there's no Just prayed on the weaker

1249
01:09:37,460 --> 01:09:45,000
Yeah, there's no rules Against doing that Against sabotaging
other teams Yep Yeah, okay, so we just need to find out

1250
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:56,120
whose overall 20th place and then take their then take their
POI I Don't know if we can even be 20th place I don't

1251
01:09:56,120 --> 01:10:01,020
there's no way I think we are the 20 in terms of gum skill.

1252
01:10:01,020 --> 01:10:05,660
No, no, I think we are the 20th There's one open POI
turbine.

1253
01:10:06,580 --> 01:10:07,140
Oh, that's good.

1254
01:10:07,160 --> 01:10:07,660
Oh, okay.

1255
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:08,560
Let's do it.

1256
01:10:08,580 --> 01:10:09,040
Let's get turbine.

1257
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:13,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah Say turbine in chat, please or You're gonna
change your thingy.

1258
01:10:14,140 --> 01:10:20,180
Guys, or we can get three points and land on the 20th team
overall.

1259
01:10:20,940 --> 01:10:23,860
But here's the thing, if we lose the 20th place team, what
the fuck are we gonna do?

1260
01:10:23,880 --> 01:10:25,520
Then we're the 20th place team.

1261
01:10:25,700 --> 01:10:27,880
Then we're fucking bad.

1262
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:29,020
And then we become the 20th place team.

1263
01:10:30,980 --> 01:10:31,940
Oh my gosh.

1264
01:10:31,980 --> 01:10:33,900
Are you, do you not believe in this way?

1265
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:36,360
I believe in, I...

1266
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:37,780
Okay, okay, do you not believe in me.

1267
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:39,320
Let's not add tempo into the equation.

1268
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:40,360
No, no, I believe in you, but like...

1269
01:10:40,360 --> 01:10:40,840
Yeah, yeah, okay.

1270
01:10:40,940 --> 01:10:42,380
You want to play at three player, you know?

1271
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:49,660
i mean yeah yeah i'm pretty good for a platform player you
know you think about it yeah yeah for a platform player is

1272
01:10:49,660 --> 01:10:56,480
that pretty good if we get like if we get like tempo not to
die we're good to go you know what i'm saying that's true

1273
01:10:56,480 --> 01:11:02,260
hey we're good i'm back tempo got us two points last game
yeah yeah that's the thing we need him to be alive to farm

1274
01:11:02,260 --> 01:11:09,880
points for us all right yeah we just need a i just i'm
confused it's you know why you know why that happened

1275
01:11:09,880 --> 01:11:16,740
because i was on and i was like oh i can fly and then i flew
to the roof honestly this is what wait this is if i was if i

1276
01:11:16,740 --> 01:11:23,360
was any other legend i would not have been able to make it
up on the roof and i'd be like way this is why you never

1277
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:30,640
listen to your heart i was trying to be a good teammate he
was so excited play valg i don't know what you say to be a

1278
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:38,100
good teammate you seem that you're like i'm gonna play valg
no because he wanted you to play octane tempo was the one

1279
01:11:38,100 --> 01:11:44,560
that was trying to be a good teammate realistically
realistically we want to be honest here tempo should be

1280
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:52,780
playing the controller characters okay okay yeah you know
i'll take i'll take all the controllers unless there's a

1281
01:11:52,780 --> 01:12:01,740
fuse okay wait tell them not to put fuse in yeah i might
message them to say not to put fuse in yeah tell them to

1282
01:12:01,740 --> 01:12:08,880
remove all fuses from now on show them my chat says you
realize that dokey still has zero kills on cat yeah you

1283
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:21,380
still have zero kills on cat yeah dude keeping that
tradition less than 100 dead we're so towards why is there

1284
01:12:21,380 --> 01:12:23,200
so many teams a alive still.

1285
01:12:23,860 --> 01:12:25,560
Watch because we died pretty early.

1286
01:12:25,740 --> 01:12:26,940
Yeah, that's because...

1287
01:12:27,700 --> 01:12:29,800
We didn't even get the Valculte that game.

1288
01:12:30,020 --> 01:12:31,820
We didn't even get any old.

1289
01:12:32,940 --> 01:12:35,460
Guys, 20th place by own tournament is crazy.

1290
01:12:35,720 --> 01:12:35,940
Yeah.

1291
01:12:36,820 --> 01:12:38,920
You have to get at least 19th next game.

1292
01:12:39,100 --> 01:12:39,480
We have to.

1293
01:12:39,820 --> 01:12:41,080
Please, please.

1294
01:12:41,420 --> 01:12:42,720
We're not improving.

1295
01:12:43,160 --> 01:12:45,520
No one's contesting next game.

1296
01:12:46,340 --> 01:12:46,360
Guys.

1297
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:46,560
Okay.

1298
01:12:46,940 --> 01:12:47,480
That's good.

1299
01:12:47,820 --> 01:12:48,500
Okay, that's good.

1300
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:50,880
That's already like one thing we don't have to worry about.

1301
01:12:52,020 --> 01:12:52,680
That's true.

1302
01:12:52,900 --> 01:12:55,020
No, that also means no one's going to die to me.

1303
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:56,360
We got to not die right.

1304
01:12:56,520 --> 01:12:59,960
We should tell everybody what our skins are so they won't
run at us.

1305
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:03,540
And then we'll give them someone else's skin so that they
chase after.

1306
01:13:03,740 --> 01:13:04,460
That is so true.

1307

I'm now a yellow bang.

1310
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:11,780
We'll all play yellow skins.

1311
01:13:11,940 --> 01:13:12,140
I'm down.

1312
01:13:12,220 --> 01:13:13,820
It's like bright yellow or bright pink.

1313
01:13:14,060 --> 01:13:14,340
No, no.

1314
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:15,960
We're giving people...

1315
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:16,080
Wait, wait.

1316
01:13:16,160 --> 01:13:17,180

1317
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:18,240
Olympus next.

1318
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:20,720
We're giving people other people's skins.

1320
01:13:27,780 --> 01:13:36,180

um we got we were doing so well that ea staff told us to sit

1321
01:13:36,180 --> 01:13:41,540
this one out so other people can watch parting from inside
the game now yeah i want to say right now that this is

1322
01:13:41,540 --> 01:13:49,820
better than international scrims quality we have 14 teams
alive after 12 seconds of the first game people don't get

1323
01:13:49,820 --> 01:13:52,160
money Of course, this is better.

1324
01:13:52,660 --> 01:13:53,200
Your show, right?

1325
01:13:53,320 --> 01:13:53,780
Your show, right.

1326
01:13:54,760 --> 01:13:55,420
Money changed.

1327
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,140
Even if they did.

1328
01:13:57,640 --> 01:13:58,440
Not for us, though.

1329
01:13:58,800 --> 01:13:59,840
Not for us.

1330
01:13:59,980 --> 01:14:01,600
We're not changing anything for us.

1331
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:03,020
We're literally content.

1332
01:14:03,720 --> 01:14:08,020
No, Temple, you should start giving vouchers for your scrims
so people take it more seriously.

1333
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:10,940
Like, a $5 coupon for something.

1334
01:14:12,760 --> 01:14:14,480
A $5 coupon?

1335
01:14:15,540 --> 01:14:16,860
We'll give you a sub.

1336
01:14:17,060 --> 01:14:19,340
We'll give you five subs if you survive.

1337
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:20,520
Pass around.

1338
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:30,080
so true that's so true that's how that's how we should do
the payout yeah instead of instead of overall placement if

1339
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:38,700
you survive every team that's around like pass round three
for every for every round you survive your team earns extra

1340
01:14:38,700 --> 01:14:48,980
money it like earns like five subs yeah per person that
would be financed by wig yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah like the

1341
01:14:48,980 --> 01:14:55,120
bank account for everybody yeah got you okay but wait it'll
give you better quality scrims which means better like more

1342
01:14:55,120 --> 01:15:04,680
viewers in general which means more income in general so
you're in the end you're gonna gain money in the end yeah

1343
01:15:04,680 --> 01:15:12,740
yeah because viewers would want to watch better scrims
because the scrims will be longer too yeah yeah so more and

1344
01:15:12,740 --> 01:15:22,760
then you can run as many ads as you want sorry guys i'm
gonna run ads now that's a funny joke he has a fascination

1345
01:15:22,760 --> 01:15:29,280
with me spending money she's like listen like tempo gets
these kills you just drop like 600 bucks each like it's not

1346
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:37,220
that big it's motivation money motivates people it's true
look at look at right now you've never had look at the

1347
01:15:37,220 --> 01:15:46,560
quality of this of money this is the most motivated i've
seen sniped down a very long time you whoa him not being

1348
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:55,240
relegated him being relegated probably didn't help this is
good he's playing like he's 10 years younger right now oh

1349
01:15:55,240 --> 01:16:11,100
yeah and his eyes and he just died and he gets beeped across
the map you had to stay regulated yeah No fucking way, dude.

1350
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:14,900
You just actually VTuber cursed him so hard.

1351
01:16:15,780 --> 01:16:18,320
You're the one that mentioned his name first.

1352
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:19,380
What do you mean?

1353
01:16:19,720 --> 01:16:23,560
I was talking about getting money motivation.

1354
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:24,480
Yeah, but you're here.

1355
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:24,920
You're here.

1356
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:26,040
I'm here.

1357
01:16:26,120 --> 01:16:27,300
I give the extra curse.

1358
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:28,120
Agreed.

1359
01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:30,760
There's got to be something along with VTubers and curses.

1360
01:16:31,940 --> 01:16:32,640
They don't make sense.

1361
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:36,120
No, I think casters give a better curse than VTubers.

1362
01:16:36,700 --> 01:16:38,460
I will agree that I definitely give a harder curse.

1363
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:38,660
Yeah.

1364
01:16:39,780 --> 01:16:41,200
I'll agree with that one.

1365
01:16:42,740 --> 01:16:43,540
This is a hard zone.

1366
01:16:43,700 --> 01:16:45,300
I'm going to be honest guys, I'm kind of happy we died.

1367
01:16:46,420 --> 01:16:47,160
What do you mean?

1368
01:16:47,380 --> 01:16:47,640
No.

1369
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:49,980
You're happy that we died 20th?

1370
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:53,060
Yeah, a little bit because I don't think we embarrass
ourselves in this zone.

1371
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:55,220
We would have been on that house on the left side.

1372
01:16:55,620 --> 01:16:55,980
Uh-huh.

1373
01:16:56,820 --> 01:16:58,920
We could have vouched over there and got the house.

1374
01:16:59,320 --> 01:17:00,120
That would have been us.

1375
01:17:01,240 --> 01:17:03,840
I just, I think the tempo is just a boss for that.

1376
01:17:04,020 --> 01:17:06,220
Just sitting on top of a roof like that is crazy.

1377
01:17:06,460 --> 01:17:09,140
Yeah, with white armor, that was actually crazy.

1378
01:17:09,160 --> 01:17:16,900
no you're a piece of that like all confidence white armor
did you not take you on white armor i don't know you leveled

1379
01:17:16,900 --> 01:17:24,440
up into that right here i mean i don't think it would help
he was dead regardless if it was white or blue if i had blue

1380
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:31,040
i would have been alive you were literally dead he's still
charged rightfully tempo your reaction time on that was

1381
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:40,080
crazy how do you know you didn't see anything you were just
dead you're still in the same spot i looked up And you were

1382
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:42,260
still standing still when you were getting shot.

1383
01:17:42,500 --> 01:17:43,700
What do you mean?

1384
01:17:44,440 --> 01:17:45,800
I don't know what you're talking about.

1385
01:17:45,980 --> 01:17:47,520
I'm talking about you, Tempo.

1386
01:17:47,640 --> 01:17:48,340
Jersey's off.

1387
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:50,760
Jersey's off.

1388
01:17:50,860 --> 01:17:53,560
Are you taking off your fucking shirt right now on stream?

1389
01:17:56,440 --> 01:17:57,440
I'm ready.

1390
01:17:58,080 --> 01:17:58,220
No.

1391
01:17:58,620 --> 01:18:01,860
The day I stop playing is the day Tempo plays in a
tournament with me shirtless.

1392
01:18:02,360 --> 01:18:05,220
He's gonna... Bro, he's shirtless right now!

1393
01:18:06,820 --> 01:18:07,380
Look at this.

1394
01:18:07,560 --> 01:18:08,580
Is that toss?

1395
01:18:09,640 --> 01:18:11,180
Can you play with your titties out?

1396
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:20,560
No, it'd be like, you know, like those, like, like, nipple
stickers that they, to, like, on Twitch, people who do it on

1397
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:21,440
Twitch for body paint.

1398
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:23,160
Pasty's, the pasties, the pasties.

1399
01:18:23,500 --> 01:18:25,120
How do you know the name of that?

1400
01:18:25,720 --> 01:18:27,600
I mean, I'd be knowing things.

1401
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:30,200
How do you know their name?

1402
01:18:30,340 --> 01:18:32,600
I used to watch makeup tutorials when I was younger, all the
time.

1403
01:18:32,980 --> 01:18:33,340
Really?

1404
01:18:33,700 --> 01:18:34,440
Wait, really?

1405
01:18:34,860 --> 01:18:36,480
Yeah, I was, like, interested in makeup for a while.

1406
01:18:36,680 --> 01:18:37,400
Oh, shit.

1407
01:18:39,660 --> 01:18:41,320
No, I do not wear pasties.

1408
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:42,720
Why not?

1409
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:45,280
I'm fucking naked.

1410
01:18:46,260 --> 01:18:48,460
Bro, but you had a fascination.

1411
01:18:49,160 --> 01:18:50,860
No, I was just interested with makeup.

1412
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:52,100
I was like, oh, these people are good at it.

1413
01:18:52,200 --> 01:18:52,480
You know what I'm saying?

1414
01:18:52,900 --> 01:18:53,340
How many?

1415
01:18:53,500 --> 01:18:57,300
Okay, if you put that as a goal.

1416
01:18:59,400 --> 01:18:59,540
What?

1417
01:18:59,640 --> 01:19:01,420
To wear pasties on street?

1418
01:19:02,580 --> 01:19:07,720
There is not a single goal that would get me shirtless with
nipple tassels on my fucking skin.

1419
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:18,900
tassels but like just cover it as if you have no nipples i
would actually rather have tassels than any of us wait wait

1420
01:19:18,900 --> 01:19:29,840
why would you not want to be nippleless right i don't want
to see what i look like like that oh my god someone said you

1421
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:36,180
could make them spin that's what i'm saying that's why all
right we're back what do you mean we're back we've been dead

1422
01:19:36,180 --> 01:19:40,720
the whole time we've been here the I went to go grab.

1423
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:44,480
Wait, are you actually shirtless right now?

1424
01:19:45,560 --> 01:19:45,860
No.

1425
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:47,800
Bro, no balls.

1426
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:50,160
No balls is crazy.

1427
01:19:50,580 --> 01:19:51,020
No.

1428
01:19:52,660 --> 01:19:53,340
Hey, wait.

1429
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:55,280
Oh, no, no, he's dead.

1430
01:19:55,580 --> 01:19:56,380
Oh, God, who's winning?

1431
01:19:56,520 --> 01:19:57,660
Just tell me who is winning.

1432
01:19:58,400 --> 01:19:59,960
Well, not Drops team.

1433
01:20:00,440 --> 01:20:02,480
We just saw him got bowed down, man.

1434
01:20:02,980 --> 01:20:03,320
Got rocked.

1435
01:20:03,980 --> 01:20:05,460
You gotta make sure I'm anonymous next game.

1436
01:20:07,220 --> 01:20:07,960
I should have all the pros one.

1437
01:20:07,960 --> 01:20:08,460
This is more fun.

1438
01:20:09,160 --> 01:20:09,700
I mean, it is.

1439
01:20:09,860 --> 01:20:10,200
I agree.

1440
01:20:10,660 --> 01:20:11,660
Jim Brunson won.

1441
01:20:12,300 --> 01:20:13,280
Of course he did it.

1442
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:14,080
Of course.

1443
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:17,000
Wait, so you wouldn't.

1444
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:18,000
Wait, you wouldn't wear it.

1445
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:19,240
I'm going to turn my audio back on.

1446
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:20,720
Why wouldn't you wear Paises?

1447
01:20:22,980 --> 01:20:25,320
Why are you afraid of being like nipple-less?

1448
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:26,780
I don't understand, Whig.

1449
01:20:27,180 --> 01:20:29,600
I just don't want to see what I look like without- I don't
know.

1450
01:20:29,860 --> 01:20:32,200
I'm just- I mean, I'm down, but I hope I'm trying to do it
on stream.

1451
01:20:32,460 --> 01:20:32,840
You know what I mean?

1452
01:20:32,920 --> 01:20:36,800
Like, I'm not trying to be like, no nipples on stream.

1453
01:20:37,100 --> 01:20:39,080
I'm not even trying to show my nipples on stream.

1454
01:20:39,160 --> 01:20:41,000
But it's not against TOS.

1455
01:20:41,560 --> 01:20:43,560
No, I like fully understand it's not against TOS.

1456
01:20:43,780 --> 01:20:45,360
It's just like, you know, I'm not trying to just show my
nip.

1457
01:20:46,040 --> 01:20:49,220
But you won't be showing it because it won't be seen.

1458
01:20:50,620 --> 01:20:51,600
Dropped, bro.

1459
01:20:51,900 --> 01:20:55,040
Why did you do that to poor tempo?

1460
01:20:56,020 --> 01:21:02,400
Man was scoped in 499, nine times charge rifling.

1461
01:21:03,740 --> 01:21:05,660
Bro, people, your chat wants it.

1462
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:06,960
They want that content.

1463
01:21:07,160 --> 01:21:07,840
Of course my chat wants it.

1464
01:21:07,860 --> 01:21:09,040
They see me as a piece of me.

1465
01:21:10,620 --> 01:21:14,560
I bend over to turn my Christmas tree on, and it's just
non-stop fucking comments.

1466
01:21:14,740 --> 01:21:17,360
Why do you have a Christmas tree on so you can make an
excuse to bend over?

1467
01:21:18,060 --> 01:21:19,260
No, I should get a whiteboard, though.

1468
01:21:19,660 --> 01:21:20,420
Oh, you should.

1469
01:21:20,680 --> 01:21:24,880
Every time, like, you use it to put the scores down for
scrims.

1470
01:21:25,160 --> 01:21:27,900
So every time you're like, oh, this team won, you can bend.

1471
01:21:28,100 --> 01:21:29,440
You can turn it around.

1472
01:21:30,360 --> 01:21:31,640
Oh, look at these winners.

1473
01:21:31,980 --> 01:21:34,160
Look at all these scrim winners.

1474
01:21:36,420 --> 01:21:37,740
That's content right there.

1475
01:21:39,160 --> 01:21:39,420
content.

1476
01:21:39,480 --> 01:21:41,680
I'm asking Drop how bad your reaction time was.

1477
01:21:43,780 --> 01:21:44,860
Yo, the game doesn't count.

1478
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:45,120
Okay.

1479
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:47,580
Cause anonymous zone was supposed to happen, but it didn't.

1480
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:51,900
So the whole game is, is a, is a, oh my God.

1481
01:21:52,220 --> 01:21:52,220
Yes.

1482
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:53,780
The wipe thingy.

1483
01:21:53,780 --> 01:21:54,060
Wake.

1484
01:21:54,360 --> 01:21:55,180
Tell them right now.

1485
01:21:55,340 --> 01:21:56,800
It probably can do that.

1486
01:21:56,980 --> 01:21:57,840
We can do a tournament.

1487
01:21:58,160 --> 01:22:01,220
Since it's your tournament, this game doesn't count because
anonymous was not on.

1488
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:01,640
Yeah.

1489
01:22:02,460 --> 01:22:02,860
Yeah.

1490
01:22:02,980 --> 01:22:02,980
Yeah.

1491
01:22:03,220 --> 01:22:04,760
Wait, tell them that right now.

1492
01:22:05,780 --> 01:22:06,420
All righty.

1493
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:07,080
Where am I?

1494
01:22:07,180 --> 01:22:07,740
What am I telling them?

1495
01:22:07,880 --> 01:22:08,220
What am I doing?

1496
01:22:08,580 --> 01:22:09,100
Tell them.

1497
01:22:09,160 --> 01:22:15,360
that because anonymous mode was not on when you told him it
doesn't count it doesn't count this game is wiped off for

1498
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:19,640
sure i think they're totally gonna listen to me after
they've paid for everyone to be there for a certain amount

1499
01:22:19,640 --> 01:22:26,560
of hours no i'll just know i mean obviously i think donkeys
right i'll just put another i'll put like 20 000 my own

1500
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:34,240
money into this exactly yeah exactly you can make it back by
having a whiteboard you're a genius you're a genius yeah you

1501
01:22:34,240 --> 01:22:40,780
can add and you break even exactly one add 20 000 yeah that
works that works that works you're like maybe two legends

1502
01:22:40,780 --> 01:22:52,480
new legends maybe two ads ash boy oh yeah crypto vantage
caustic lifeline all right obviously tempos caustic yes all

1503
01:22:52,480 --> 01:23:03,460

um I mean to be fair the other ones are just wherever you're

1504
01:23:03,460 --> 01:23:08,320
comfortable with Oh, bro, I'm down with anything, honestly.

1505
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:11,860
I mean, we can do lifeline just to craft people if Tempo
dies.

1506
01:23:14,760 --> 01:23:17,720
Or wait, no, actually, and Wig dies because you're the...

1507
01:23:19,580 --> 01:23:21,820
You're going to be taking most of the hits.

1508
01:23:22,580 --> 01:23:25,400
I should probably play Path for rotational purposes.

1509
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:29,040
I'll play Path for our rotations, zip lines and stuff.

1510
01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:30,580
I'll play Lifeline for the Crafter.

1511
01:23:31,380 --> 01:23:32,340
Okay, you cool with that?

1512
01:23:33,320 --> 01:23:34,100

drop turbine because if someone tries to contest this

1524
01:25:00,620 --> 01:25:03,580
turbine, it means another POI is open.

1525
01:25:04,040 --> 01:25:05,020
There's one team, right?

1526
01:25:05,240 --> 01:25:05,440

We'll just late drop and if someone contests us it would
destroy a 2009 their PC.

1530
01:25:17,850 --> 01:25:20,190
I mean, no one's doing turbine, I don't think.

1531
01:25:20,370 --> 01:25:21,270
There's no one doing turbine.

1532
01:25:21,550 --> 01:25:21,550

Don't say that.

1560
01:27:33,410 --> 01:27:34,390
There has to be a team.

I think trombus.

1579
01:28:29,910 --> 01:28:30,850
We're playing Olympus.

1580
01:28:31,210 --> 01:28:33,850
I was going to say it's terminal in Olympus.

1581
01:28:34,650 --> 01:28:36,150
Okay, we're landing in an Olympus.

1582
01:28:36,210 --> 01:28:38,490
I'm going to say we're landing a terminal.

1583
01:28:39,650 --> 01:28:43,310
No, but what if they land on turbine now thinking we're
going terminal?

1584
01:28:43,770 --> 01:28:44,090
No, they won't.

1585
01:28:44,110 --> 01:28:45,050
No, we don't go terminal.

1586
01:28:45,690 --> 01:28:47,310
I said we're landing terminal.

1587
01:28:47,770 --> 01:28:48,610
There's no way.

1588
01:28:48,710 --> 01:28:49,610
There's no way.

1589
01:28:50,430 --> 01:28:51,690
If they do that, we're fucked.

1590
01:28:51,810 --> 01:28:53,870
There's no way they're the last place.

1591
01:28:53,930 --> 01:28:54,130
Oh wait.

1592
01:28:54,250 --> 01:28:55,430
They have kind never mind.

1593
01:28:55,630 --> 01:29:00,350
I'm scared The last place we just got back.

1594
01:29:00,650 --> 01:29:03,330

It's not updated yet though.

1597
01:29:05,830 --> 01:29:11,010
That's why and they have a control player, too No, no, no,
they're saying they're saying terminal.

1598
01:29:11,470 --> 01:29:17,430
They're saying we will fight you and you die to us in

It wasn't 20 seconds, okay?

How does that make it better?

1608
01:30:25,790 --> 01:30:26,910

Yeah, six.

1617
01:30:40,230 --> 01:30:40,910

1622
01:31:12,290 --> 01:31:21,310
i told you guys i know but we got stuck on command bro how
did they get into command if we went in the middle because

1623
01:31:21,310 --> 01:31:26,590
they went front side i think they thought that no one was
there so there's one in the front and then because we went

back next they might not they might not come back next one

1625
01:31:31,990 --> 01:31:37,670

Wait, wait.

1626
01:31:37,810 --> 01:31:40,770
That means that I can see where in Stormpoint is.

1627
01:31:40,930 --> 01:31:42,890
How the hell said that sucks, Storm?

1628
01:31:45,790 --> 01:31:47,390
I just got jury duty.

1629
01:31:47,630 --> 01:31:48,070
Have fun, man.

1630
01:31:49,310 --> 01:31:51,890
Are you supposed to go to jury duty like yearly?

1631
01:31:52,650 --> 01:31:52,930
No.

1632
01:31:53,270 --> 01:31:53,750
You can pretend.

1633
01:31:54,010 --> 01:31:54,410
You can.

1634
01:31:54,530 --> 01:31:56,130
You get R&G for jury duty.

1635
01:31:56,190 --> 01:32:02,690
Yeah, you get R&G for jury duty, and then you can tell them
that you're not competent enough to be a... Yeah, just say

1636
01:32:02,690 --> 01:32:03,310
you're stupid.

1637
01:32:03,610 --> 01:32:04,650
I would do that 100%.

1638
01:32:04,650 --> 01:32:11,790
Just be like, I'm like, get on like a really crazy intense
big case that would be scary that's why you don't take the

1639
01:32:11,790 --> 01:32:18,650
case that's why you take it that's why you take it and then
you know okay here's like the here's how to get out of like

1640
01:32:18,650 --> 01:32:26,710
jerry okay as a not an american but like this is how you
can't wait wait wait wait character pathfinder don't you're

1641
01:32:26,710 --> 01:32:31,270
playing lifeline and okay what do you find I'll stick.

1642
01:32:31,510 --> 01:32:32,330
Wait, can the leader of the prison?

1643
01:32:32,490 --> 01:32:33,650
I'll be in Canada.

1644
01:32:35,130 --> 01:32:35,930
Yes, I saw him.

1645
01:32:36,030 --> 01:32:36,250
Okay.

1646
01:32:36,350 --> 01:32:41,850
As I was saying, like to get out jury duty, if it's like
something that's like a really high prolific case, you can

1647
01:32:41,850 --> 01:32:43,410
be like, I sympathize with the murderer.

1648
01:32:44,170 --> 01:32:46,730
And then you're already have like a bias towards the.

1649
01:32:47,390 --> 01:32:49,030
And then they're like, oh, I guess we can't have you.

1650
01:32:49,070 --> 01:32:49,270
Yeah.

1651
01:32:49,270 --> 01:32:53,210
Because you have to be in jury duty, you have to have no
biases at all.

1652
01:32:53,590 --> 01:32:55,190
So you can you can just be like, I don't know.

1653
01:32:55,270 --> 01:32:56,230
I think he could be he.

1654
01:32:56,250 --> 01:32:57,650
I think he was a nice guy.

1655
01:32:57,870 --> 01:32:59,150
I think he's a nice guy.

1656
01:33:03,610 --> 01:33:05,330
So you get out of jury duty.

1657
01:33:05,750 --> 01:33:08,090
Why don't you just say that to the victims instead?

1658
01:33:08,290 --> 01:33:09,390
Like I sympathize with them.

1659
01:33:09,490 --> 01:33:10,630
Well, you don't say it to the victims.

1660
01:33:10,670 --> 01:33:14,310
You say it to the judge because they're picking the people
who are doing jury duty.

1661
01:33:14,410 --> 01:33:15,370
You know, you're right, man.

1662
01:33:16,390 --> 01:33:19,430
Yeah, so they won't know you said that.

1663
01:33:19,550 --> 01:33:21,250
You know, the victims won't know.

1664
01:33:22,270 --> 01:33:23,670
Only the judge will know.

1665
01:33:24,210 --> 01:33:28,210
And then they'll be like, we can't put you in jury duty
because you already have a bias towards the murderer.

1666
01:33:28,710 --> 01:33:30,170
I don't think you have to worry at all, Doki.

1667
01:33:30,230 --> 01:33:36,990
I don't think you're ever getting picked based off these
estate you say they're watching they're watching you know

1668
01:33:36,990 --> 01:33:46,950
take this seriously show us algae league it's a joke it's
not a joke get her it's a joke it was a joke guys for legal

serious better do not take my mile minus tempo on caustic

1670
01:33:55,590 --> 01:33:57,350

01:33:57,770 --> 01:33:58,570
I'm gonna fucking cry.

1672
01:33:58,650 --> 01:33:59,750
I might cry.

1673
01:33:59,910 --> 01:34:00,190
I might cry.

1674
01:34:00,390 --> 01:34:00,590
I might cry.

1675
01:34:00,810 --> 01:34:01,410

Just jump right now before someone just jump, tempo, jump,

Before somebody tries to- Watch my jumping.

1678
01:34:08,190 --> 01:34:10,630
Before somebody takes turbine from us.

1679
01:34:10,810 --> 01:34:11,270
Yeah, please.

1680
01:34:11,510 --> 01:34:12,510
We need something in this world.

1681
01:34:12,670 --> 01:34:12,810
Yeah.

1682
01:34:13,950 --> 01:34:16,110
How do we not have a fucking beacon again?

1683
01:34:17,690 --> 01:34:19,390
This game actually wants me to go out.

1684
01:34:19,490 --> 01:34:21,910
I don't want to be part of five, guys.

1685
01:34:23,350 --> 01:34:25,570
What did you just say?

1686
01:34:25,590 --> 01:34:29,310
I don't want to be bottom five, guys.

1687
01:34:29,550 --> 01:34:30,570
No, that's give a sale.

1688
01:34:31,730 --> 01:34:32,830
No, that ship is gone.

1689
01:34:32,990 --> 01:34:33,750
What are you talking about?

1690
01:34:33,850 --> 01:34:35,250
We are bottom five, pretty sure.

1691
01:34:35,690 --> 01:34:36,030
No.

1692
01:34:37,230 --> 01:34:38,570
No, what happened?

1693
01:34:38,650 --> 01:34:40,990
We used to be so good at this game.

1694
01:34:41,390 --> 01:34:42,850
What happened to...

1695
01:34:42,850 --> 01:34:46,750
We were supposed to do challenges, sir, kid.

1696
01:34:46,890 --> 01:34:48,150
You are still doing it.

1697

I have high hopes anymore.

1701
01:34:53,210 --> 01:34:54,870
I never had high hopes to begin with.

1702
01:34:55,590 --> 01:34:56,830

01:39:25,270 --> 01:39:25,410
We just wait.

1805
01:39:25,710 --> 01:39:25,970

We have a Moby.

1810
01:39:29,590 --> 01:39:30,150
We don't have a redeploy.

I do have a Zipline.

1812
01:39:31,770 --> 01:39:32,770
So efficiency.

1813
01:39:33,850 --> 01:39:34,930
We can make this work.

1814
01:39:35,110 --> 01:39:35,790
18 place.

1815
01:39:36,010 --> 01:39:36,630
18 place.

1816
01:39:37,010 --> 01:39:37,250
Let's go.

1817
01:39:37,930 --> 01:39:38,870
Green war for another.

1818
01:39:38,890 --> 01:39:41,390
I'm saying if it goes towards garden, our rotate through.

1819
01:39:41,470 --> 01:39:42,110
There's still a guy here.

1820
01:39:43,390 --> 01:39:43,910
There is.

1821
01:39:44,010 --> 01:39:44,670
Oh, I see him.

1822
01:39:45,130 --> 01:39:45,950
It's probably outblown.

1823
01:39:46,170 --> 01:39:46,450
It's probably outblown.

1824
01:39:46,450 --> 01:39:47,030
Green Pathfinder.

1825
01:39:47,550 --> 01:39:47,990
That might be out.

1826
01:39:48,490 --> 01:39:48,970
To be honest.

1827
01:39:49,370 --> 01:39:49,570
Okay.

1828
01:39:49,810 --> 01:39:52,430
Someone type in this chat right now to not push us.

1829
01:39:53,630 --> 01:40:02,430

so i never i mean let me there's no rules and twitch rivals

1830
01:40:02,430 --> 01:40:11,090

01:40:20,550 --> 01:40:21,670
Do not go into it.

1834
01:40:23,250 --> 01:40:24,690
Do not go into it.

1835
01:40:24,910 --> 01:40:27,470
Because I think he'll actually push us now that he knows
we're there.

1836
01:40:27,630 --> 01:40:29,070
So do not go into it.

1837
01:40:29,310 --> 01:40:29,890
Alright, we gotta go Rift.

1838
01:40:29,990 --> 01:40:30,250
We gotta go Rift.

1839
01:40:30,370 --> 01:40:33,330
Come on, come, come on, come on, come on, come on.

1840
01:40:33,910 --> 01:40:35,210
And they just, a whole team just flew in.

01:40:35,310 --> 01:40:35,990
We're so chocked.

1842
01:40:36,810 --> 01:40:37,330
Oh no.

1843
01:40:37,870 --> 01:40:38,990
A whole team just flew in this building.

1844
01:40:39,350 --> 01:40:40,130
And this building passed.

1845
01:40:41,210 --> 01:40:42,690
I want to go next if we can.

1846
01:40:43,490 --> 01:40:43,910
You see when we get out.

1847
01:40:43,910 --> 01:40:44,710
I don't want to push that one down.

1848
01:40:44,830 --> 01:40:45,110
Come here, come here.

1849
01:40:45,670 --> 01:40:45,910
Alright.

1850
01:40:47,070 --> 01:40:47,790
Oh, there's a team here.

1851
01:40:47,930 --> 01:40:48,350
Fuck me.

1852
01:40:48,390 --> 01:40:49,030
Go back, go back, go back.

1853
01:40:49,590 --> 01:40:51,770
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1854
01:40:52,090 --> 01:40:52,910
They literally can't go to the front.

1855
01:40:53,030 --> 01:40:54,490
This is how do we not have a...

1856
01:40:54,490 --> 01:40:56,070
I have a...

1857
01:40:56,070 --> 01:40:58,830
I'm going to drop down my Lifeline package.

1858
01:40:59,670 --> 01:40:59,870
How?

1859
01:41:00,430 --> 01:41:02,490
Maybe we'll get something here.

1860
01:41:02,670 --> 01:41:03,650
Okay, you guys stay here?

1861
01:41:03,970 --> 01:41:04,970
Yeah, yeah, you guys are going to get loot.

1862
01:41:05,110 --> 01:41:05,970
Get EvoCache yourselves.

1863
01:41:06,250 --> 01:41:06,270
Yeah.

1864
01:41:06,290 --> 01:41:08,270
I'm going to go check up on Energy Depot until we get
Rotate.

1865
01:41:08,350 --> 01:41:08,610
Just stay up.

1866
01:41:08,670 --> 01:41:09,190
Just stay down here.

1867
01:41:09,370 --> 01:41:09,590
One second.

1868
01:41:09,910 --> 01:41:10,690
Let's go about the scenes.

1869
01:41:11,050 --> 01:41:12,310
There was no EvoCache, by the way.

1870
01:41:12,390 --> 01:41:12,750
It was just...

1871
01:41:12,750 --> 01:41:14,310
Was there an EVAC tower on that or no?

1872
01:41:14,310 --> 01:41:14,650
Nope.

1873
01:41:15,490 --> 01:41:16,410
There was nothing.

1874
01:41:17,010 --> 01:41:18,730
There was a purple heavy mag.

1875
01:41:18,970 --> 01:41:19,290
Yay!

1876
01:41:19,750 --> 01:41:21,030
Just reach the enemy again.

1877
01:41:21,050 --> 01:41:21,970
Wait, they feel behind us!

1878
01:41:23,130 --> 01:41:24,070
Wait, where are you?

1879
01:41:24,110 --> 01:41:24,910
Where are you?

1880
01:41:25,030 --> 01:41:25,470
You're watching, guys.

1881
01:41:26,210 --> 01:41:27,810
Come over here, come here, come here, come here, come here.

1882
01:41:28,070 --> 01:41:28,870
Tempo, keep running, come around.

1883
01:41:28,890 --> 01:41:29,290
Look over you, buddy.

1884
01:41:30,310 --> 01:41:30,490
Come right here, buddy.

1885
01:41:30,490 --> 01:41:31,550
Oh, no!

1886
01:41:32,090 --> 01:41:32,710
Why me?

1887
01:41:33,590 --> 01:41:34,670
Why is it me?

1888
01:41:35,530 --> 01:41:36,330
I'm dead too.

1889
01:41:36,890 --> 01:41:37,610
It's time to go.

1890
01:41:37,610 --> 01:41:38,590
It's time to go wig.

1891
01:41:38,690 --> 01:41:39,370
Run, run, run.

1892
01:41:39,570 --> 01:41:40,330
You can craft this.

1893
01:41:40,530 --> 01:41:41,350
You can craft this.

1894
01:41:41,370 --> 01:41:43,210
This is exactly why I went lifeline.

1895
01:41:43,730 --> 01:41:44,910
This is exactly why.

1896
01:41:44,910 --> 01:41:45,630
How does that happen?

1897
01:41:45,710 --> 01:41:46,910
How do we get walked up on?

1898
01:41:47,030 --> 01:41:48,190
I'm getting sent on?

1899
01:41:48,950 --> 01:41:49,350
I'm dead.

1900
01:41:49,890 --> 01:41:51,030
Bro, this is...

1901
01:41:52,050 --> 01:41:53,990
Who the fuck is this, man?

1902
01:41:54,850 --> 01:41:57,110
Bro, when are we gonna get a fucking evac?

1903
01:41:58,710 --> 01:42:02,370
We haven't got one evac, and we haven't got a fucking
beacon.

1904
01:42:02,970 --> 01:42:04,270
Wait, wait, we gotta kill them.

1905
01:42:04,550 --> 01:42:05,390
So it's not a zero.

1906
01:42:05,530 --> 01:42:06,410
We got one.

1907
01:42:06,570 --> 01:42:07,130
No, one kill.

1908
01:42:07,610 --> 01:42:08,830
We got one.

1909
01:42:09,830 --> 01:42:14,230
Bro, not a single evac, not a single beacon.

1910
01:42:14,610 --> 01:42:15,970
I'm going to lose it.

1911
01:42:16,210 --> 01:42:19,570
I literally did not hear anything for the team that walked
up on us, too.

1912
01:42:19,590 --> 01:42:24,590
be fair to be crazy because that's not even the team that
killed you guys that just killed me it's a completely

1913
01:42:24,590 --> 01:42:37,470
different squad wait your squad is already on red with 34
damage bro that was max team too i'm so i'm so sad how how

1914
01:42:37,470 --> 01:42:45,590
do i how do we not get a beacon how do we not get a single
scan in three games out of command center or fucking

1915
01:42:45,590 --> 01:42:55,590
turbines all i'm saying is like i we need to let tempo roam
free and maybe yeah i might just make you i might make you

1916
01:42:55,590 --> 01:43:01,970
play a controller legend and you just literally land on a
beacon somewhere and if you make it to us by the time we get

1917
01:43:01,970 --> 01:43:10,690
a zone we're good we're so i swear this is like the best
strat we let him roam free you literally land on one of

1918
01:43:10,690 --> 01:43:16,770
those where you scan it across the map and you just meet up
with better wait what map is next then next is going to be

1919
01:43:16,770 --> 01:43:24,290
geyser again what guys are you bro geyser we should have a
beacon somewhere man oh no i even commandously a 90 and and

1923
01:43:53,350 --> 01:43:54,790
I didn't even hear anything.

01:43:55,130 --> 01:44:04,990
We didn't hear the walk up at all I have no idea how it's
possible Release him from why is that team walking up on it?

1925
01:44:05,410 --> 01:44:06,850
It was max team.

1926
01:44:07,190 --> 01:44:08,430
It was max team.

1927
01:44:08,570 --> 01:44:11,570
I fucking knew he was gonna kill us Different fucking team.

1928
01:44:11,870 --> 01:44:20,030
It was two teams that pursued our building Oh my god, that's
insane now I understand sweet dreams for strays not getting

1929
01:44:20,030 --> 01:44:20,430
beacons.

1930
01:44:20,830 --> 01:44:25,230
It's nice that you're doing a watch party and own
tournament.

1931
01:44:25,430 --> 01:44:25,870
I'm bad at you.

1932
01:44:26,650 --> 01:44:27,310
Oh my God, three.

1933
01:44:27,530 --> 01:44:29,510
This is like your own tournament too.

1934
01:44:29,690 --> 01:44:32,310
Why is your own tournament so fucked up?

1935
01:44:32,970 --> 01:44:35,290
Why is it so cursed against you?

1936
01:44:35,510 --> 01:44:36,330
Why do they hate us bro?

1937
01:44:36,430 --> 01:44:37,050
Why do they hate us?

1938
01:44:37,150 --> 01:44:37,450
That's what I'm saying.

1939
01:44:37,590 --> 01:44:37,930
Okay, we're back.

1940
01:44:38,850 --> 01:44:39,490
What do you mean we're back?

1941
01:44:39,810 --> 01:44:40,370
We were already back.

1942
01:44:40,370 --> 01:44:42,250
It can't be my own tournament and then we have a good time.

1943
01:44:42,570 --> 01:44:45,030
Friends, but those of you that know that we're going to have
a good time.

1944
01:44:45,350 --> 01:44:45,390
It's okay.

1945
01:44:45,590 --> 01:44:46,010
It's okay.

1946
01:44:46,310 --> 01:44:53,230
Those two teams that are winning right now, they're not
having as fun as we are do you think that's actually true

1947
01:44:53,230 --> 01:45:05,330
though they might be winning do you believe that with their
whole chest they might be winning but they're not having as

1948
01:45:05,330 --> 01:45:14,150
fun as we are that could be more true i agree because
somehow i'm rage induced but i'm just having a great time

1949
01:45:19,930 --> 01:45:33,050
everything yeah they might win more money and be more
financially secured but what do we do we laugh but but but

1950
01:45:33,050 --> 01:45:42,850
homies for life actually homies like where are they are they
dead oh they go the corner yeah those teams those teams are

1951
01:45:42,850 --> 01:45:49,450
doing much better than us and they are winning you know they
won't be back together after this tournament also like yeah

1952
01:45:49,590 --> 01:45:54,470
fucking nerds a little bit of them right like yeah they want
a little bit nerds get you know yeah they're fucking nerds

1953
01:45:54,470 --> 01:46:02,970
how dare they be good at a video game but you know they
won't reconvene back together and do a reunion or anything

1954
01:46:02,970 --> 01:46:09,090
they're gonna forget each other the next day yeah but we

1955
01:46:09,090 --> 01:46:15,850
feel better chat yeah we're like just we're like the team
where it's like if we can be in a tournament so can you

1956
01:46:15,850 --> 01:46:23,890
anything is possible for you guys if they are allowing us to
play this tournament with all these pro players who are

1957
01:46:23,890 --> 01:46:33,670
infinitely better than us that means you can too one day
wait wait wait i'm included i don't know about it really

1958
01:46:33,670 --> 01:46:42,210
better i won't say though after those shots i just gave them
that was they're definitely infinitely better i just gave

1959
01:46:42,210 --> 01:46:43,330
them 14 warning shots

1960
01:46:46,790 --> 01:46:47,450
That's right.

1961
01:46:47,730 --> 01:46:48,050
Thank you.

1962
01:46:48,270 --> 01:46:48,890
You're so lampple.

1963
01:46:49,170 --> 01:46:50,170
Like, when the chat...

1964
01:46:50,170 --> 01:46:50,570
No, I'm just down to earth.

1965
01:46:50,690 --> 01:46:51,070
You know what I mean?

1966
01:46:51,270 --> 01:46:51,830
Like, you get it?

1967
01:46:51,950 --> 01:46:52,510
Yeah, exactly.

1968
01:46:52,650 --> 01:46:53,250
You're humans.

1969
01:46:53,450 --> 01:46:57,310
Like, when chat watches other pro players, they're like, oh
my god, these shots are inhumane.

1970
01:46:57,470 --> 01:46:58,290
That's what I'm saying.

1971
01:46:58,570 --> 01:47:00,030
There's no way he's able to...

1972
01:47:00,030 --> 01:47:03,410
But then when they watch you, they're like, oh yeah, he's
definitely a real person.

1973
01:47:03,650 --> 01:47:04,010
Like, he's...

1974
01:47:04,010 --> 01:47:04,650
That can be fun.

1975
01:47:04,810 --> 01:47:05,910
He's definitely a player.

1976
01:47:06,550 --> 01:47:06,870
Yeah.

1977
01:47:07,030 --> 01:47:07,930
From Apex Legends.

1978
01:47:08,350 --> 01:47:09,490
I shit just like you guys.

1979
01:47:09,690 --> 01:47:10,250
Yeah, yeah.

1980
01:47:10,430 --> 01:47:13,450
And they're like, people would be like, oh my god, he's on
controller and still missing?

1981
01:47:13,730 --> 01:47:14,450
So relatable.

1982
01:47:24,490 --> 01:47:34,610
guys i have a secret plan what's your there's two teams
contesting at harvester so what does that mean for us yeah

1983
01:47:34,610 --> 01:47:42,670
what does that mean for us we're literally on geyser i'm not
hurting harvester when i'm back i'm someone you see you know

1984
01:47:42,670 --> 01:47:47,730
exactly what the internet crash right back you know exactly
what that means what is that What the heck does that mean?

1985
01:47:47,850 --> 01:47:48,910
We need some KP.

1986
01:47:49,170 --> 01:47:51,650
There's no way we're gonna be able to get there from Geiser.

1987
01:47:52,230 --> 01:47:53,530
Who said we're landing Geiser?

1988
01:47:55,090 --> 01:47:56,970
Okay, is Temple gonna...

1989
01:47:56,970 --> 01:47:58,630
Temple, you can third party them for us.

1990
01:47:59,110 --> 01:48:01,970
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1991
01:48:03,330 --> 01:48:04,550
Great idea, guys.

1992
01:48:06,190 --> 01:48:07,670
Okay, you two land Geiser and loot.

1993
01:48:08,270 --> 01:48:12,870
I'll land Harvester and try to sneak like a three kill or
two, and then I'll run away.

1994
01:48:12,990 --> 01:48:13,590
Yeah, exactly.

1995
01:48:13,770 --> 01:48:14,270
And then they'll...

1996
01:48:14,270 --> 01:48:16,110
Yeah, and then I'll loot...

1997
01:48:16,110 --> 01:48:22,650
and then i'll meet up with you guys at geyser no if he fails
if he fails we have we have any craft yeah we can craft him

1998
01:48:22,650 --> 01:48:30,530
in geyser that is so smart if you watch the advantage that
looks like us out there that was crazy i was thinking of a

1999
01:48:30,530 --> 01:48:41,710
strap no i had i had max pov there okay okay yeah well we'll
i mean we are sending temple out to rome so temple you're

2000
01:48:41,710 --> 01:48:55,530
gonna land on harvester oh my game didn't crash my discord
restart said it's so but i'm okay now yeah we have a plan we

2001
01:48:55,530 --> 01:49:02,770
have guaranteed one kill we're just gonna we're just gonna
let tempo roam free around the map for it i'm gonna go third

2002
01:49:02,770 --> 01:49:09,210
harvester and then and then suicide and then you guys craft
me a geyser and then bring me back to life yeah that's the

2003
01:49:09,210 --> 01:49:15,150
best plan you've ever had should guarantee us one kill Yeah,
one point is there.

2004
01:49:15,550 --> 01:49:15,670
And then we're back in the game.

2005
01:49:16,490 --> 01:49:18,310
I don't know about back in the game, but yeah.

2006
01:49:18,890 --> 01:49:19,410
Back in the game.

2007
01:49:22,610 --> 01:49:23,110
All right.

2008
01:49:23,610 --> 01:49:25,470
See, now I'm kind of happy we didn't play this zone again.

2009
01:49:25,590 --> 01:49:25,970
You know what I mean?

2010
01:49:26,670 --> 01:49:28,910
I think you're just coping, like.

2011
01:49:29,330 --> 01:49:29,870
No, never.

2012
01:49:30,110 --> 01:49:31,390
I think you're just coping.

2013
01:49:32,010 --> 01:49:32,850
No, this makes sense.

2014
01:49:32,950 --> 01:49:34,310
The playing this zone has been way too difficult.

2015
01:49:38,030 --> 01:49:38,630
I'm not kidding.

2016
01:49:38,710 --> 01:49:41,070
I actually went 0 for 7 on Sentinel shots to cover for you
guys.

2017
01:49:41,570 --> 01:49:43,290
I said I'm covering for you guys, and I did not.

2018
01:49:43,310 --> 01:49:50,990
covered once i'm covering we ran up we died that's why we're
so relatable thank you people watch us for the relatability

2019
01:49:50,990 --> 01:49:58,470
i know i'm down to earth i got it thank you yeah people are
like people don't want to watch a a robot they want to watch

2020
01:49:58,470 --> 01:50:01,730
somebody that can make mistakes despite how many they make.

2021
01:50:01,950 --> 01:50:05,210
They want to just feel like they... Is it a mistake?

2022
01:50:05,750 --> 01:50:06,890
When do you make mistakes?

2023
01:50:07,950 --> 01:50:09,190
Despite how many to make.

2024
01:50:14,770 --> 01:50:19,870
Look, I'm saying as a team, as a team, I'm not singling
out...

2025
01:50:20,570 --> 01:50:27,550
I'm not singling out anybody here, but if anyone wants to
give out examples of how they made mistakes, that's on them.

2026
01:50:28,910 --> 01:50:40,270
I can't think of an mistake for my end, but like oh no no no
no we never know no but like if anybody else wants to tell

2027
01:50:40,270 --> 01:50:45,910
what the mistakes they made that's that's totally fine yeah
tempo if you want to open up bro we're not gonna try yeah

2028
01:50:45,910 --> 01:51:00,070
yeah you want to open up too tempo like zero mistakes no oh
zero mistakes oh okay then we we know i like how what i was

2029
01:51:00,070 --> 01:51:04,710
like i don't remember my mistakes you you're like yeah
you're right and then for example it's like oh you're

2030
01:51:04,710 --> 01:51:12,310
delusional okay my mistakes just why can't you put that down
right out the window double moby is crazy and we can't even

2031
01:51:12,310 --> 01:51:19,810
find an evac fucking tower we can't even find there was no
fucking anything in my package i got purple enemy back that

2032
01:51:19,810 --> 01:51:31,830
was great and they got double moby and we can't find a
fucking evac unreal it's okay all our luck It's because

2033
01:51:31,830 --> 01:51:33,050
you're the tournament organizer.

2034
01:51:33,330 --> 01:51:35,590
Every fucking luck is not with us.

2035
01:51:36,130 --> 01:51:36,870
That's low-key true, though.

2036
01:51:37,010 --> 01:51:39,910
I feel like I actually cursed myself by being the organizer.

2037
01:51:42,270 --> 01:51:43,010
You should...

2038
01:51:43,010 --> 01:51:44,110
Okay, you know what was funny?

2039
01:51:44,330 --> 01:51:44,850
You should...

2040
01:51:44,850 --> 01:51:47,550
Honestly, Greek should have been a caster in your
tournament.

2041
01:51:49,550 --> 01:51:51,790
Honestly, they asked people on the player cast.

2042
01:51:52,150 --> 01:51:53,870
I don't think I regret my decision yet.

2043
01:51:54,170 --> 01:51:59,390
I feel like it would have been so funny that Greek would
have been so funny that Greek was a caster in your own

2044
01:51:59,390 --> 01:51:59,950
tournament.

2045
01:52:01,430 --> 01:52:03,370
And behind me, that'd be so fucked.

2046
01:52:03,670 --> 01:52:08,710
That'd be so fucked.

2047
01:52:10,890 --> 01:52:12,210
Just make him watch.

2048
01:52:12,850 --> 01:52:15,030
Yeah, just make him watch party.

2049
01:52:16,850 --> 01:52:19,050
It's just that would be so fucked.

2050
01:52:21,790 --> 01:52:23,070
Wait, who's team is this?

2051
01:52:23,610 --> 01:52:25,170
You're still casting it so far.

2052
01:52:25,410 --> 01:52:25,910
Wait a minute.

2053
01:52:26,650 --> 01:52:26,930
Ew.

2054
01:52:28,310 --> 01:52:29,190

be honest yeah you know what them winning we know the player

2057
01:52:52,110 --> 01:52:58,610
right yeah temple you got it not land exactly no let him
land well no because you can do you can just craft me craft

2058
01:52:58,610 --> 01:53:04,850

at all the drop spots and there's all right yeah yeah he

2061
01:53:19,030 --> 01:53:25,330
made a spreadsheet and everything but how many games is this
is this like six games or five games we got three more to

2062
01:53:25,330 --> 01:53:34,650

uh oh boy 25 points.

2063
01:53:34,790 --> 01:53:35,970
So we need 8 a game.

2064
01:53:38,650 --> 01:53:40,010
Wait, Gen is going.

2065
01:53:40,690 --> 01:53:41,150
Harvester.

01:53:41,350 --> 01:53:42,170
Wait, he's going Harvester.

2067
01:53:42,690 --> 01:53:42,890
Okay.

2068
01:53:43,010 --> 01:53:44,210
I think that's one of the teams.

2069
01:53:44,450 --> 01:53:45,350
Someone else is going Harvester.

2070
01:53:50,110 --> 01:53:51,070
Yanya and...

2071
01:53:51,070 --> 01:53:51,950

2086
01:55:02,070 --> 01:55:08,150
saying in the chat bro there's no fuse pathfinder octane
bloodhound rampart catalyst all right so obviously i'm

2087
01:55:08,150 --> 01:55:10,770
playing I guess I'll play either Loba and Newcastle.

2088
01:55:11,050 --> 01:55:11,710
Which one should I do?

2089
01:55:13,190 --> 01:55:14,910
I feel like we're always poor on loot.

2090
01:55:15,590 --> 01:55:17,090
I feel like...

2091
01:55:17,090 --> 01:55:18,070
Yeah, yeah, definitely.

2092
01:55:18,330 --> 01:55:18,730
I agree.

2093
01:55:18,930 --> 01:55:20,090
I feel like we have been getting...

2094
01:55:20,090 --> 01:55:21,470
Doing really well in the loot department.

2095
01:55:21,550 --> 01:55:21,930
Just saying.

2096
01:55:22,050 --> 01:55:22,490
I'm just saying.

2097
01:55:22,990 --> 01:55:24,610
Yeah, I mean, what dickhead put us on this?

2098
01:55:24,630 --> 01:55:25,050
Oh, wait.

2099
01:55:25,370 --> 01:55:27,410
This is the one game that doesn't have an assault.

2100
01:55:28,190 --> 01:55:28,470
No.

2101
01:55:28,730 --> 01:55:29,230
That's fine.

2102
01:55:29,330 --> 01:55:29,530
That's fine.

2103
01:55:29,550 --> 01:55:30,010
That's fine.

2104
01:55:30,030 --> 01:55:30,570
You don't need it.

2105
01:55:30,650 --> 01:55:31,910
All you need to do is just kill them.

2106
01:55:31,990 --> 01:55:32,510
That's really it.

2107
01:55:32,530 --> 01:55:33,130
No, no, wait.

2108
01:55:33,130 --> 01:55:34,690
If you're dropping over there, we need the ring.

2109
01:55:34,910 --> 01:55:36,550
But you're going to have to wait for you to craft it at the
ring.

2110
01:55:38,270 --> 01:55:44,650
them and then do the ring at harvester i'm just so
optimistic i hate it okay let's do it yeah okay i'm down

2111

01:56:57,930 --> 01:56:59,270
They should nominate us.

2128
01:56:59,410 --> 01:57:00,890
The Golden Cockies?

2129
01:57:01,210 --> 01:57:01,470
What is that?

2130
01:57:01,910 --> 01:57:02,190
Golden Cock?

2131
01:57:02,690 --> 01:57:03,710

2132
01:57:03,910 --> 01:57:04,630

Cackies?

Yes, cackies.

2140
01:57:14,570 --> 01:57:16,530
Is that how you pronounce it?

2141
01:57:16,970 --> 01:57:18,890
The golden cockies.

2142
01:57:19,910 --> 01:57:25,690
They had to nominate us for the golden cackies, and then we
win by sheer popular vote.

2143
01:57:26,530 --> 01:57:28,570
Unless Hal is in there, so obviously we're not going to win.

2144
01:57:28,570 --> 01:57:28,890
Oh, no, no.

2145
01:57:29,070 --> 01:57:30,730

01:57:56,040 --> 01:57:57,220
They're not going to start the game.

2159
01:57:59,040 --> 01:58:01,520
You're not going to start the game.

2160
01:58:01,660 --> 01:58:02,320
We're so fine.

2161
01:58:03,300 --> 01:58:03,660

Wait, Greek.

01:59:30,840 --> 01:59:31,880

2195
01:59:38,340 --> 01:59:38,640
Oh my God.

2196
01:59:38,720 --> 01:59:39,120

Doki just exploded.

Wait, what about landing tunnel that's close to the balloon?

2206

What is, what's tunnel that's close to the balloon?

2207
02:00:01,600 --> 02:00:01,980
Wait.

2208

In, in, uh, Harvester.

2209
02:00:04,380 --> 02:00:05,900
Are you picked first, though?

2210
02:00:06,080 --> 02:00:08,260
How did he...

2211
02:00:08,260 --> 02:00:09,620
It's the curse.

2212
02:00:11,420 --> 02:00:12,600
It's the curse.

2213
02:00:12,860 --> 02:00:14,060
I can feel the curse.

2214
02:00:14,180 --> 02:00:14,980
there's a tunnel?

2215
02:00:17,240 --> 02:00:18,160
Oh, it started.

2216
02:00:18,500 --> 02:00:19,580
You guys have your picks?

2217
02:00:20,280 --> 02:00:21,200
I have my pick.

2218
02:00:23,380 --> 02:00:23,800
Wig?

2219
02:00:24,400 --> 02:00:26,040
I bet you Wig ran into Gick.

2220
02:00:26,320 --> 02:00:28,620
Wig, we can't have minus five.

2221
02:00:28,700 --> 02:00:30,480
We only have five points!

2222
02:00:31,120 --> 02:00:31,580
Who am I playing?

2223
02:00:32,200 --> 02:00:33,320
I thought you were playing Octane.

2224
02:00:33,740 --> 02:00:34,420
Yeah, man, man.

2225
02:00:34,540 --> 02:00:35,560
Yeah, I'm playing Lobo.

2226
02:00:35,900 --> 02:00:37,000
Yeah, I got cat.

2227
02:00:37,680 --> 02:00:41,660
I was going to say, we literally only have five points.

2228
02:00:41,720 --> 02:00:43,380
We can't have a minus five.

2229
02:00:43,680 --> 02:00:44,160
Yeah.

2230
02:00:44,180 --> 02:00:47,240
I mean, even if we got 10 points here, we're still bottom
five.

2231
02:00:48,220 --> 02:00:48,900
Wait, what?

2232
02:00:49,540 --> 02:00:49,940
Wait, what?

2233
02:00:50,260 --> 02:00:51,100
Where are you seeing the scores?

2234
02:00:51,600 --> 02:00:53,080
The Google Sheet thing isn't updated.

2235
02:00:53,480 --> 02:00:54,060
I'm just guessing.

2236
02:00:54,200 --> 02:00:54,760
I'm guessing here.

2237
02:00:54,780 --> 02:00:55,660
Oh, okay.

2238
02:00:57,400 --> 02:00:58,820
Bro, what happened to us?

2239
02:00:59,460 --> 02:01:00,600
We fell off, man.

2240
02:01:01,080 --> 02:01:02,380
We were never on.

2241
02:01:03,160 --> 02:01:04,640
What do you mean we did so well?

2242
02:01:04,720 --> 02:01:05,780
We fell off of.

2243
02:01:05,920 --> 02:01:07,800
We did so well as rivals.

2244
02:01:07,800 --> 02:01:09,060
What happened to us?

2245
02:01:09,780 --> 02:01:10,600
Temple drop alone.

2246
02:01:10,740 --> 02:01:11,260
Watch this.

2247
02:01:11,460 --> 02:01:11,760
Redemption round.

2248
02:01:11,880 --> 02:01:12,640
Temple's going to kill it right here.

2249
02:01:12,780 --> 02:01:13,000
Okay.

2250
02:01:13,160 --> 02:01:13,980
Temple, just remember.

2251
02:01:14,180 --> 02:01:14,860
Just leave us.

2252
02:01:14,960 --> 02:01:15,700
Remember to solo.

2253
02:01:15,780 --> 02:01:17,460
You can pick a big pathfinder, not Octane.

2254
02:01:17,580 --> 02:01:17,740
It's fine.

2255
02:01:18,180 --> 02:01:18,580
Octane.

2256
02:01:19,040 --> 02:01:19,200
Pathfinder is fine.

2257
02:01:19,320 --> 02:01:19,840
Is Pathfinder the thingy?

2258
02:01:19,880 --> 02:01:20,480
Oh, it is.

2259
02:01:20,880 --> 02:01:21,800
No minus five.

2260
02:01:22,240 --> 02:01:22,720
Jesus Christ.

2261
02:01:23,200 --> 02:01:23,360
Oh, my God.

2262
02:01:23,440 --> 02:01:24,420
There's no zero points.

2263
02:01:24,860 --> 02:01:25,700
Holy fuck, dude.

2264
02:01:27,220 --> 02:01:28,200
Oh, my God.

2265
02:01:28,340 --> 02:01:29,200
Goodbye, Tempo.

2266
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:30,320
Goodbye.

2267
02:01:31,240 --> 02:01:31,920
Oh, my God.

2268
02:01:31,920 --> 02:01:32,460
Thank God.

2269
02:01:33,220 --> 02:01:34,000
Pathfinder's choice, chat.

let me know if anymore it's loot time loot time my existence
is to just sit here because i don't have any range yeah

2439
02:11:28,230 --> 02:11:33,630
you're good just a team underneath us make sure we just
don't get walked up on yeah i'll aim up this window at them

2440
02:11:33,630 --> 02:11:40,870
wait they're on Okay, I'm going to say, I feel like they
might low, like, they might, they might rampart our door.

2441
02:11:42,190 --> 02:11:44,930
Honestly, that being on the roof is pretty good for us.

2442
02:11:44,990 --> 02:11:45,570
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2443
02:11:45,870 --> 02:11:48,830
They're carrying, they're, they're like, they're like our,
our wall.

2444
02:11:49,050 --> 02:11:51,790
How is this guy walking up if there's a team on our roof?

2445
02:11:52,590 --> 02:11:53,130
They're breaching.

2446
02:11:53,170 --> 02:11:55,590
As I say, they're not going to push us and this team just
literally sits there for free.

2447
02:11:55,710 --> 02:11:56,150
That's crazy.

2448
02:11:57,370 --> 02:11:58,450
They have their priorities.

2449
02:11:59,050 --> 02:11:59,910
Oh yeah, we're locked in.

2450
02:11:59,990 --> 02:12:00,930
We're so good guys.

2451
02:12:01,190 --> 02:12:02,750
We got good spots.

2452
02:12:03,090 --> 02:12:03,950
Look at us.

2453
02:12:04,510 --> 02:12:05,390
We're fucking killing it.

2454
02:12:06,390 --> 02:12:08,410
We just need a team to die around us.

2455
02:12:09,130 --> 02:12:09,810
That's what I'm saying.

2456
02:12:10,110 --> 02:12:11,230
Now, we're going to get so much loot.

2457
02:12:11,510 --> 02:12:12,550
We should be good for next zone.

2458
02:12:12,650 --> 02:12:14,170
I'm pretty sure the next zone is going to pull towards us.

2459
02:12:14,230 --> 02:12:14,930
Yeah, me too.

2460
02:12:15,470 --> 02:12:16,050
I think.

2461
02:12:16,150 --> 02:12:16,610
I could be wrong.

2462
02:12:17,330 --> 02:12:18,350
I'm just going to believe in you.

2463
02:12:19,210 --> 02:12:19,490
Thank you.

2464
02:12:19,670 --> 02:12:20,810
That's actually the nicest thing you ever seen.

2465
02:12:22,350 --> 02:12:24,170
I've always believed in you.

2466
02:12:24,690 --> 02:12:25,270
Thank you so much.

2467
02:12:25,710 --> 02:12:30,270
Like, why is Webby and CC with you for seven, maybe
hypothetically, seven hours?

2468
02:12:30,750 --> 02:12:31,390
This guy's just out in the open.

2469
02:12:31,390 --> 02:12:32,250
Three and a half hour.

2470
02:12:33,090 --> 02:12:34,570
He's just out in the open shooting.

2471
02:12:34,790 --> 02:12:36,210
I don't know how he's doing that with the team.

2472
02:12:36,390 --> 02:12:43,330

02:12:43,330 --> 02:12:53,510
honest the hundred percent yeah okay a little horny yeah how
is this team on the roof not shooting these guys and what's

2479
02:13:35,690 --> 02:13:37,090
in their ability Yeah.

Flesh.

That team should die.

2486
02:13:48,570 --> 02:13:50,090
There's no way someone's going to let them do that.

2487
02:13:50,590 --> 02:13:50,750
Whoa.

2488
02:13:50,850 --> 02:13:52,330

Literally make sure that no one pushes the door.

2580
02:17:41,600 --> 02:17:42,300
That's all we need right now.

2581
02:17:42,600 --> 02:17:42,760

02:17:42,760 --> 02:17:44,100

One second.

2589
02:17:48,300 --> 02:17:49,700
I'm going to keep looking at the door.

2590
02:17:49,820 --> 02:17:50,600
I'm looking at the store just in case.

2591
02:17:50,780 --> 02:17:51,240

02:17:54,920 --> 02:17:55,400
That guy's a beast.

2595
02:17:59,110 --> 02:18:00,270
Actually, the plan is so fast.

2596
02:18:00,610 --> 02:18:01,390
All right, I'm going to back here.

2597
02:18:01,690 --> 02:18:02,210
Just keep on this door.

2598
02:18:02,210 --> 02:18:03,610
There's a red for us here, if you need it.

2599
02:18:04,130 --> 02:18:04,430
Oh, nice.

2600

Refresh, refresh it.

2602
02:18:06,110 --> 02:18:06,870
You should refresh it.

2603
02:18:07,210 --> 02:18:08,930
It's a refresh, not a natural red.

2604
02:18:09,570 --> 02:18:09,750

It's fine.

2662
02:20:04,890 --> 02:20:06,070
If someone walks behind us, they're idiots.

2663
02:20:06,270 --> 02:20:06,650
They shouldn't.

2664
02:20:06,750 --> 02:20:07,890
Yeah, I'm watching behind us.

2665
02:20:09,230 --> 02:20:09,550
Okay.

2666
02:20:09,630 --> 02:20:10,170

No, bro, right when I start looking.

2672
02:20:16,450 --> 02:20:17,690
I said they're looking.

2673
02:20:19,070 --> 02:20:20,470
Why would I stop looking?

2674
02:20:21,410 --> 02:20:22,710
I threw, I threw.

2675
02:20:23,290 --> 02:20:23,650

2678
02:20:26,010 --> 02:20:27,490
Of course I threw.

2679
02:20:27,850 --> 02:20:28,530
And I got wooden.

2680
02:20:28,830 --> 02:20:29,170
I'm gonna throw.

2681
02:20:29,250 --> 02:20:29,710
You guys thought it.

2682
02:20:30,130 --> 02:20:32,110
The moment they stopped looking.

2683
02:20:34,290 --> 02:20:36,610
I saw like a fucking car salesman.

2684
02:20:39,070 --> 02:20:40,110
It pushed.

2685
02:20:42,070 --> 02:20:43,190
The timing!

2686
02:20:43,390 --> 02:20:44,950
And now my camera fell!

2687
02:20:45,430 --> 02:20:46,910

Wait, where's Greek?

2706
02:22:26,170 --> 02:22:27,350
Okay, Greek is team 14.

02:22:28,270 --> 02:22:28,730
Team 14.

2708
02:22:28,990 --> 02:22:31,530
Team 14 got 19 placed with zero kills.

2709
02:22:32,150 --> 02:22:33,870
So they're actually last last.

2710
02:22:34,750 --> 02:22:36,310
Oh my god, they're probably molding right now.

2711
02:22:36,430 --> 02:22:36,950
I'm so happy.

2712
02:22:37,110 --> 02:22:38,770
Bro, they're actually last last.

2713
02:22:38,910 --> 02:22:41,510
We're not last because we got points replacements.

2714
02:22:42,230 --> 02:22:43,570
That's so good for us, dude.

2715
02:22:44,190 --> 02:22:46,030

it as long as greek's team does not have does not have a

2718
02:23:03,770 --> 02:23:15,070
winning game we're fine i'm saying that's why i really care
about this is that yeah yeah is that not winning your

2719
02:23:15,070 --> 02:23:23,090
roommate doesn't win at all is that is that is that what you
want you can explain to you right when i looked away they

2720
02:23:23,090 --> 02:23:31,530

back at you or god i fucked it up so bad i was like wait

2721
02:23:31,530 --> 02:23:40,570
where did you go where did my other the other person go and
he said this is the only angle that matters and then i

2722
02:23:40,570 --> 02:23:43,290
immediately i immediately just looked at the other team

2723
02:23:47,210 --> 02:23:52,250
i just completely blacked out because i just saw a full
three man in the back i did like 800 damage to him too that

2724
02:23:52,250 --> 02:24:00,530
was crazy oh i got too horny this is what it is all right
wish it's top six next one's top five yeah is that how math

2725
02:24:00,530 --> 02:24:11,250
works next one's top five yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah we got
this okay command center was snipes team jurassic is open

2726
02:24:11,250 --> 02:24:13,710
there's two teams contesting storm catcher.

2727
02:24:14,130 --> 02:24:15,130
Jurassic's terrible, bro.

2728
02:24:15,810 --> 02:24:17,190
So do we want Jurassic balls?

2729
02:24:17,970 --> 02:24:19,810
Oh my God, Jurassic's so bad.

2730
02:24:21,970 --> 02:24:24,710
Isn't it like Jurassic like way worse loot than anywhere
else we can go?

2731
02:24:25,350 --> 02:24:29,230
But on this map that I googled, on this map that I googled,
it has a beacon.

2732
02:24:31,070 --> 02:24:32,010
That means we've got a beacon.

2733
02:24:32,090 --> 02:24:33,850
So we're not contested at Jurassic if we go there.

2734
02:24:34,130 --> 02:24:34,730
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2735
02:24:35,450 --> 02:24:37,790
Because somehow we still didn't have a beacon at Geyser.

2736
02:24:38,130 --> 02:24:38,630
Let's do it.

2737
02:24:38,690 --> 02:24:39,050
Let's do it.

2738
02:24:39,110 --> 02:24:39,390
Let's do it.

2739
02:24:39,450 --> 02:24:40,010
Let's just go Jurassic.

2740
02:24:40,570 --> 02:24:47,970
If we go Jurassic and there's a beacon at command center
well no there's a team command center too yeah that's fair

2741
02:24:47,970 --> 02:25:01,190
okay let's go to jasmine no drown don't no no this is it
wait wait wait what what what happened i'm gonna i'm gonna

2742
02:25:01,190 --> 02:25:08,450
do the same thing uh can we is there can we is there a
crafter at jurassic i mean temple we got nothing out of you

2743
02:25:08,450 --> 02:25:13,970
doing that yeah we got we got beacon i stole harv i scanned
harvester's beacon when I ran back.

2744
02:25:14,630 --> 02:25:15,810
But if we have beacon here, we don't need to.

2745
02:25:16,650 --> 02:25:17,370
So let's see first.

2746
02:25:17,490 --> 02:25:17,890
Let's see first.

2747
02:25:17,950 --> 02:25:19,390
All right, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2748
02:25:19,950 --> 02:25:23,470
And then if not, I'll go third stone catcher, scam beacon,
and then die.

2749
02:25:24,150 --> 02:25:25,390
Oh, yeah, yeah, because we have crafter.

2750
02:25:25,550 --> 02:25:25,990
We have crafter.

2751
02:25:26,230 --> 02:25:28,690
Yeah, and two teams are contesting as storm catcher, so
we're good.

2752
02:25:28,830 --> 02:25:29,970
It's the exact same plan.

2753
02:25:30,050 --> 02:25:30,250
Yep.

2754
02:25:30,830 --> 02:25:31,410
This is it.

2755
02:25:32,610 --> 02:25:32,830
Yeah.

2756
02:25:33,030 --> 02:25:35,350
Okay, wait, okay, so what are the legends?

2757
02:25:35,610 --> 02:25:37,910
What are the legends that are...

2758
02:25:38,710 --> 02:25:39,430
Or played?

2759
02:25:39,650 --> 02:25:42,890
Because, like, our strategy also relates...

2760
02:25:42,910 --> 02:25:53,030
eyes on what legends we can play too no I think like letting
tempo be free actually made our gameplay so much better I

2761
02:25:53,030 --> 02:25:57,310
think so too I just don't have to worry about him yeah we
don't have to worry about him we just have to let him we

2762
02:25:57,310 --> 02:26:09,670
just have to free him then roam around then do what he wants
to do oh man it's okay guys we're not last what travels is

2763
02:26:09,670 --> 02:26:16,430
rating and also just giving 25 subs to whoever a random
streamer involved that's pretty cool oh ballistic wraith rev

2764
02:26:16,430 --> 02:26:27,550
valc cat mirage okay so clearly wick should play val no wait
there's a there's a fuse in there too clearly i think a

2765
02:26:27,550 --> 02:26:36,690
unanimous decision for this squad is that tempo is not on
valves yes yes the moment tempo was on valve we got 20th

2766
02:26:36,690 --> 02:26:45,570
you're still right you're still right okay and then tempo

2790
02:29:07,550 --> 02:29:11,370
in season five and then I never touched Mirage again.

2791
02:29:14,390 --> 02:29:17,710
I was on the Mirage leader points for season five.

2792
02:29:18,870 --> 02:29:19,930
Oh my God.

2793
02:29:20,070 --> 02:29:27,470
I was like, I was, I had the most, I was like top 10 Mirage
players because of my Mirage wins.

2794
02:29:27,570 --> 02:29:32,050
I was like number one in Canada because I had the most
Mirage wins in season five.

2795
02:29:32,730 --> 02:29:34,310
Who the fuck are you?

2796
02:29:35,510 --> 02:29:37,350
Why are you in Canada?

2797
02:29:37,550 --> 02:29:38,770
It's season five.

2798
02:29:38,950 --> 02:29:41,150
Because I had the most Mirage wins.

2799
02:29:43,950 --> 02:29:44,830
It's legit.

2800
02:29:45,450 --> 02:29:49,050
I remember it because I thought it was so funny when I
looked at the leaderboards.

2801
02:29:50,210 --> 02:29:53,910
I mean, that is for you being top in Mirage wins is pretty
fucking funny.

2802
02:29:55,230 --> 02:29:56,690
I'm expecting a carry.

2803
02:29:57,710 --> 02:29:58,590
A Mirage carry.

2804
02:30:00,250 --> 02:30:00,890
In Canada.

2805
02:30:04,490 --> 02:30:06,030
Great score is updated.

2806
02:30:06,450 --> 02:30:07,390

2822
02:32:12,260 --> 02:32:13,520
I don't know.

2823

She's awful.

2829
02:32:32,200 --> 02:32:33,000
No, no, no, no.

2830

2833
02:32:39,040 --> 02:32:39,540

2846
02:32:50,320 --> 02:32:50,560

2847
02:32:51,000 --> 02:32:51,600
I'm Kat.

2848
02:32:52,020 --> 02:32:53,320

2849
02:32:53,540 --> 02:32:53,960
Where's Valque?

2850
02:32:54,540 --> 02:32:55,800
Valque is top right.

2851
02:32:55,920 --> 02:32:56,220
Top right.

2852
02:32:56,400 --> 02:32:56,600
Top right.

2853
02:32:58,620 --> 02:32:59,080
I knew it.

2854
02:32:59,740 --> 02:33:01,760
I knew I was special.

2855
02:33:03,540 --> 02:33:05,580
Left, right, middle.

2856
02:33:05,600 --> 02:33:05,960
Okay.

2857
02:33:11,200 --> 02:33:12,080
All right, let's lock it in.

2858
02:33:13,240 --> 02:33:13,600
Here we go.

2859
02:33:13,740 --> 02:33:14,300
We got this.

2860
02:33:14,720 --> 02:33:15,400
Yeah, I got this.

2861
02:33:15,580 --> 02:33:18,560
Tempo is not on the character that I'm on, which is great.

2862
02:33:19,360 --> 02:33:19,560
Where?

2863
02:33:20,140 --> 02:33:20,560
Look at it.

2864
02:33:20,620 --> 02:33:21,120
Look at it.

2865
02:33:21,800 --> 02:33:23,560
409 season five apex wins.

2866
02:33:24,380 --> 02:33:28,600
Why is it like so, so like, yo, we have beacon and
commitment.

2867
02:33:28,620 --> 02:33:29,100
Oh!

2868
02:33:29,880 --> 02:33:31,460
Okay, then you have to land on us.

2869
02:33:32,020 --> 02:33:32,520
You have to...

2870
02:33:32,520 --> 02:33:32,840
We're so good.

2871
02:33:33,080 --> 02:33:33,900
Yeah, you land with us here.

2872
02:33:33,920 --> 02:33:35,780
Yeah, now you actually land with us.

2873
02:33:36,100 --> 02:33:36,940
Wait, can we...

2874
02:33:36,940 --> 02:33:37,200
We can't...

2875
02:33:37,840 --> 02:33:39,580
We can't do the double scan thing, right?

2876
02:33:40,180 --> 02:33:40,920
No, it doesn't work.

2877
02:33:40,980 --> 02:33:42,660
You can scan right now and then scan afterwards too.

2878
02:33:43,520 --> 02:33:43,880
But...

2879
02:33:43,880 --> 02:33:45,640
I mean, there's no point in scanning now and after this.

2880
02:33:46,100 --> 02:33:46,760
We just wait.

2881
02:33:47,040 --> 02:33:47,880
Yeah, yeah, you just gotta wait.

2882
02:33:47,900 --> 02:33:50,180
I'm just gonna land here, I guess?

2883
02:33:50,760 --> 02:33:51,220
Sure, buddy.

2884
02:33:53,060 --> 02:33:55,880
Wait, why does that team right above us seem very close?

2885
02:33:56,300 --> 02:33:56,840
Wait, what?

2886
02:33:56,960 --> 02:33:57,520
Oh, where?

2887
02:33:58,620 --> 02:34:05,120

This is one of those heirlooms I actually paid money for.

2893
02:34:31,640 --> 02:34:32,180
Do you like that?

2894
02:34:32,640 --> 02:34:39,080
Yeah, I think the Mirage statue is like one of the best
heirlooms they have.

2895
02:34:40,720 --> 02:34:43,940
Like, I love the animations on it.

2896
02:34:45,100 --> 02:34:46,720
I heavily relate to Mirage.

2897
02:34:48,340 --> 02:34:50,320
You love yourself that much.

2898
02:34:51,860 --> 02:34:54,340
I heavily relate to a guy that carries a statue around.

2899
02:34:54,580 --> 02:34:54,940
Yeah.

2900
02:34:55,180 --> 02:34:55,620

Oh shit, that's probably the better one I have.

Why me, man?

3030
02:39:58,470 --> 02:39:59,170
You want publicity?

3031
02:39:59,350 --> 02:39:59,950

02:40:01,730 --> 02:40:03,110
Yeah, you'll get all that publicity.

Think of the engagement destroyer.

Yeah, the impressions.

3041
02:40:09,790 --> 02:40:10,330
Oh, my God.

3042
02:40:10,430 --> 02:40:11,190
All the impressions.

3043
02:40:11,650 --> 02:40:12,910
I don't think I want to peek anymore, guys.

3044
02:40:12,970 --> 02:40:13,830
I don't have a lot of heals.

3045
02:40:16,090 --> 02:40:16,810
Good idea.

3046
02:40:16,990 --> 02:40:17,470
Wait, landing?

Landing, tunnel, tunnel.

Oh boy.

3052
02:40:30,050 --> 02:40:31,190
The left, the right side.

3053
02:40:31,830 --> 02:40:32,190
Oh, okay.

3054
02:40:32,310 --> 02:40:33,310
They're going to be, they're going to be on silo then.

3055
02:40:33,370 --> 02:40:33,750
You have to watch out.

3056
02:40:33,810 --> 02:40:34,050
It's way slow.

3057
02:40:34,410 --> 02:40:36,030
Yeah, I'm just going to stay down here in the stairs.

3058
02:40:36,690 --> 02:40:36,950
Yeah, you're good.

3059
02:40:36,990 --> 02:40:38,630
I'm going to show a little breath so we don't get sent on.

3060
02:40:39,090 --> 02:40:40,550
My fucking Mirage clone.

3061
02:40:41,330 --> 02:40:41,710
Oh my God.

3062
02:40:41,830 --> 02:40:43,470
The fact that I can't see anything is crazy, bro.

3063
02:40:43,510 --> 02:40:45,450
I have, uh, 10 cells, two cats.

3064
02:40:45,810 --> 02:40:46,110
There you go.

3065

They'll be like, what is this Mirage doing in the open?

3097
02:43:04,900 --> 02:43:07,200
I peeped my head through a second and got lit the fuck up.

3098
02:43:11,300 --> 02:43:11,560
All right.

3099
02:43:11,620 --> 02:43:12,900
Hopefully, guys, a minute left.

3100
02:43:13,100 --> 02:43:14,040
We'll see the damage.

3101
02:43:14,240 --> 02:43:14,560
You're on zone.

3102
02:43:14,920 --> 02:43:16,320
I think it's going right towards us.

3103
02:43:19,140 --> 02:43:21,900
I don't know if they're shooting me or what.

3104
02:43:22,360 --> 02:43:22,820
They are.

3105
02:43:24,100 --> 02:43:24,800
Wait, they are.

3106
02:43:24,800 --> 02:43:25,200
No!

3107
02:43:26,020 --> 02:43:28,340
Okay, now that I'm not doing that again.

3108
02:43:29,120 --> 02:43:29,700
We're good.

3109
02:43:31,180 --> 02:43:33,660
That I have one shield still left because I fucked around.

3110
02:43:35,400 --> 02:43:36,240
Don't hit me.

3111
02:43:38,760 --> 02:43:39,040
Okay.

3112
02:43:39,920 --> 02:43:42,260
I fucked around a little, so now I have one shield still
left.

3113
02:43:42,860 --> 02:43:43,180
Oh, nice.

3114
02:43:43,220 --> 02:43:43,920
How many of you have, Sambo?

3115
02:43:44,780 --> 02:43:47,340
I have one five now.

3116
02:43:47,660 --> 02:43:47,900
All right.

3117
02:43:48,180 --> 02:43:49,880
I am two five.

3118
02:43:51,320 --> 02:43:52,860
Alrighty, alrighty, alrighty, alrighty.

3119
02:43:52,880 --> 02:43:53,460
Let's see, let's see.

3120
02:43:53,600 --> 02:43:53,980
Come on, baby.

3121
02:44:00,730 --> 02:44:01,450
I'm real.

3122
02:44:02,710 --> 02:44:03,890
Chat, we think if the zone comes here or what?

3123
02:44:04,390 --> 02:44:05,530
I don't think so.

3124
02:44:08,390 --> 02:44:09,110
Come on.

3125
02:44:09,170 --> 02:44:09,670
Yes, you do.

3126
02:44:11,350 --> 02:44:11,710
Yes, you do.

3127
02:44:11,710 --> 02:44:12,370
Let's see it.

3128
02:44:12,670 --> 02:44:14,410
Pull to the other side.

3129
02:44:14,970 --> 02:44:15,470
Oh, Victoria.

3130
02:44:15,870 --> 02:44:16,690
Let's see it pull.

3131
02:44:17,230 --> 02:44:17,870
Oh, it's not bad.

3132
02:44:17,950 --> 02:44:18,390
That's not bad for us.

3133
02:44:18,450 --> 02:44:19,050
We're so good.

3134
02:44:19,110 --> 02:44:19,610
We're so good.

3135
02:44:19,810 --> 02:44:20,270
We're so good.

3136
02:44:20,490 --> 02:44:20,710
Great.

3137
02:44:22,930 --> 02:44:23,630
Is anyone in armory?

3138
02:44:24,370 --> 02:44:25,010
We're so good.

3139
02:44:25,150 --> 02:44:26,010
We're gonna get sent on though.

3140
02:44:26,330 --> 02:44:27,010
We're so good.

3141
02:44:28,250 --> 02:44:30,090
Do we just play backside rock over here now?

3142
02:44:31,250 --> 02:44:31,950
Isn't there people there?

3143
02:44:32,750 --> 02:44:33,190
I don't think so.

3144
02:44:35,010 --> 02:44:35,710
I mean we could.

3145
02:44:35,810 --> 02:44:36,810
We just hope it's all there for now.

3146
02:44:36,890 --> 02:44:37,250
It's all there for now.

3147
02:44:37,530 --> 02:44:38,790
Okay, we're gonna hold out Southwest.

3148
02:44:39,070 --> 02:44:39,870
We're gonna literally hold out Southwest.

3149
02:44:40,010 --> 02:44:40,290
It's the goal.

3150
02:44:40,750 --> 02:44:44,310
Oh These guys need to die on the rotation end.

3151
02:44:44,530 --> 02:44:46,370
Oh, I stuck my decoy in there.

3152
02:44:48,170 --> 02:44:49,150
I thought that was you.

3153
02:44:50,530 --> 02:44:53,130
Okay, so Southwest is gonna be our number one enemy here
guys.

3154
02:44:53,350 --> 02:44:54,750
Okay, they're gonna start cleaning us soon too.

3155
02:44:54,910 --> 02:44:57,870
Okay, I don't know why I want to waste some meds though.

3156
02:45:03,290 --> 02:45:05,170
I'm not sure if I won't waste these mids.

3157
02:45:10,300 --> 02:45:12,480
Yeah, yeah, Tempo, stop peeking, I think.

3158
02:45:13,740 --> 02:45:15,240
Yeah, definitely stop peeking, Tempo for sure.

3159
02:45:17,040 --> 02:45:18,640
Don't worry, I'm going to see if I can grab Intel.

3160
02:45:19,600 --> 02:45:22,500
I'm just peeking so I can make sure these guys know that
we're looking at them.

3161
02:45:22,680 --> 02:45:24,160
Well, yeah, yeah, yeah, me too.

3162
02:45:24,760 --> 02:45:26,460
Are they actually sniping my decoy and missing?

3163
02:45:26,540 --> 02:45:27,100
I think they are.

3164
02:45:27,700 --> 02:45:28,080
They did.

3165
02:45:28,720 --> 02:45:29,040
They did.

3166
02:45:29,040 --> 02:45:29,940
I was watching this happen.

3167
02:45:34,020 --> 02:45:35,540
Don't come this way, we're watching you.

3168
02:45:35,640 --> 02:45:37,480
They know we have to go this way, that's why.

3169
02:45:37,760 --> 02:45:38,500
They can go the other way.

3170
02:45:38,640 --> 02:45:40,140
Should we not go to the rock now, or wait?

3171
02:45:41,140 --> 02:45:42,260
Nah, they would just stay here for now.

3172
02:45:43,000 --> 02:45:45,400
I don't really want to jump too early and then we just get
fucking shit on.

3173
02:45:45,540 --> 02:45:46,340
I mean, we stop Valkalt.

3174
02:45:47,000 --> 02:45:47,760
Yeah, we do, yeah.

3175
02:45:48,340 --> 02:45:50,600
I just don't know if anyone's back there and we Valkalt,
then they take our spot.

3176
02:45:52,180 --> 02:45:52,860
It's only a problem.

3177
02:45:53,340 --> 02:45:53,980
Yeah, that's true.

3178
02:45:56,380 --> 02:45:57,480
All right, let's see where they go.

3179
02:45:58,420 --> 02:45:59,340
Let's keep looking over here.

3180
02:45:59,800 --> 02:46:00,700
Just don't take too much damage.

3181
02:46:01,200 --> 02:46:02,220
Someone dropped down here.

3182
02:46:02,680 --> 02:46:03,520
I don't know if it was that team.

3188
02:46:36,060 --> 02:46:37,000
I think that we didn't go.

3189
02:46:37,120 --> 02:46:37,920
There's a regular team back rock.

3190
02:46:38,320 --> 02:46:38,880
Knock that guy.

3191
02:46:39,080 --> 02:46:39,340

Okay.

3194
02:46:40,940 --> 02:46:42,040
I got shot from behind.

3195
02:46:42,160 --> 02:46:43,060
There's someone behind that rock.

3196
02:46:43,180 --> 02:46:43,920
They're behind the rock now.

3197
02:46:44,100 --> 02:46:44,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we're good.

3198
02:46:45,360 --> 02:46:45,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3199
02:46:48,480 --> 02:46:49,200
Everybody can kill this kid.

3200
02:46:49,280 --> 02:46:50,100
Wait, sliding down here.

3201
02:46:50,340 --> 02:46:50,700
Oh, nope.

3202
02:46:50,800 --> 02:46:51,800
He went into that tunnel.

3203
02:46:52,060 --> 02:46:52,660
Let's see where the thunder goes.

3204
02:46:54,280 --> 02:46:55,180
He's done this pull back rock.

3205
02:46:55,820 --> 02:46:56,680
Where can we go here?

3206
02:46:56,760 --> 02:46:57,480
This is so bad for us.

3207
02:46:57,680 --> 02:46:58,180
Actually, holy fuck.

3208
02:46:59,180 --> 02:47:01,700
Well, we can't go behind this because there's a team there
now.

3209
02:47:02,560 --> 02:47:03,580
We can't play silo.

3210
02:47:03,700 --> 02:47:04,120
I don't think either.

3211
02:47:04,320 --> 02:47:05,540
Silo will just get shot at.

3212
02:47:08,460 --> 02:47:08,780
Fuck.

3213
02:47:10,320 --> 02:47:11,440
Yeah, they're all the way behind.

3214
02:47:11,620 --> 02:47:13,100
I mean, we have Velcro.

3215
02:47:13,920 --> 02:47:14,940
We have Velcro here.

3216
02:47:16,500 --> 02:47:17,960
We have to help Mary somewhere.

3217
02:47:18,520 --> 02:47:20,380
I think we just walk in slow and just go to Silo here.

3218
02:47:20,480 --> 02:47:21,080
We just walk in slow.

3219
02:47:21,160 --> 02:47:22,240
I'm just trying to kill everyone that's inside.

3220
02:47:22,500 --> 02:47:23,200
That's all we can do.

3221
02:47:23,660 --> 02:47:24,200
Just play slow.

3222
02:47:24,420 --> 02:47:25,160
Don't take any damage.

3223
02:47:25,500 --> 02:47:26,380
Let these teams fight inside.

3224
02:47:26,480 --> 02:47:27,480
We just third party and walk up.

3225
02:47:27,500 --> 02:47:27,980
Stay slow.

3226
02:47:29,020 --> 02:47:29,840
We're gonna play for the height.

3227
02:47:30,420 --> 02:47:31,300
We'll see if they fight inside.

3228
02:47:31,520 --> 02:47:31,880
They should.

3229
02:47:35,590 --> 02:47:36,710
Team flying in, we're good.

3230
02:47:39,590 --> 02:47:41,350
Yep, just get some shots down, we're all good.

3231
02:47:41,610 --> 02:47:42,090
Oh, they made a wall?

3232
02:47:42,270 --> 02:47:43,670
Oh, they cat wall.

3233
02:47:43,670 --> 02:47:44,690

That's fine, yeah, we're good.

3235

They're doing something fighting whoever's there.

3236

02:53:52,310 --> 02:53:55,650
No, no, he was already past us, but we were going to ninth
with two.

3375
02:53:56,390 --> 02:53:57,610
Okay, so we're only three points a little bit.

3376
02:53:57,630 --> 02:53:59,090

This is the last game.

3419
02:55:51,030 --> 02:55:57,410
As long as Greek dies before us, then we've like established
that we're better than Greek's team.

3420
02:55:58,170 --> 02:56:00,030
Greek, you got to go out last.

3421
02:56:00,050 --> 02:56:07,110
man no do you know what's even out last what's even we have
no pro player on our team but we're still above a pro player

3422
02:56:07,110 --> 02:56:20,530
team yeah true if you think about it that way that you're
spinning yeah yeah we literally have why are you a genius we

3423
02:56:20,530 --> 02:56:33,130
basically won any team that's below us is embarrassing all
right let's pass a few more then sure that is fucking for

3424
02:56:33,130 --> 02:56:41,270
sure and that's gonna be one team which is greeks yeah is it
one team that's is it funnier if it's just one team yeah by

3425
02:56:41,270 --> 02:56:49,530
the way and rector had first pick and rector had first pick

This is our actual real comp so far.

3430
02:57:05,030 --> 02:57:07,200
It's like the only real one that makes sense.

3431
02:57:10,870 --> 02:57:12,010

I came to steal your loot.

We literally talked about- Well now, don't go anywhere.

3508

Now, play on your feet.

3509

Just stay with us.

3510
03:04:36,420 --> 03:04:39,800
We're talking about the strat together.

3511
03:04:40,260 --> 03:04:42,560
How did you forget it?

3512
03:04:42,740 --> 03:04:43,940

03:04:46,160 --> 03:04:48,040
I hope you're getting- That's okay, Gordon.

3516
03:04:49,020 --> 03:04:49,120
Don't worry.

3517
03:04:49,220 --> 03:04:50,520
I turned around that one-night game.

3518
03:04:51,040 --> 03:04:51,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3519
03:04:51,420 --> 03:04:51,820
Don't worry.

3520
03:04:52,280 --> 03:04:53,720
We're the team of the people.

3521
03:04:53,880 --> 03:04:55,160
We're the team of the people, guys.

3522
03:04:56,200 --> 03:04:58,360
This has to be fucking somewhere near us, dude.

3523
03:04:58,540 --> 03:05:00,640
Like, this needs to be near us.

3524
03:05:00,980 --> 03:05:02,160
There's just no way it's not.

3525
03:05:02,240 --> 03:05:03,500
It has to be somewhere fucking close.

3526
03:05:03,700 --> 03:05:04,300
It just has to be.

3527
03:05:05,600 --> 03:05:06,860
Where is a beacon that we can hit?

3528
03:05:07,220 --> 03:05:07,840
Power grid.

3529
03:05:08,140 --> 03:05:09,300
That's not good for us, actually.

3530
03:05:09,360 --> 03:05:10,280
That is not good for us.

3531
03:05:10,360 --> 03:05:10,700
We should not.

3532
03:05:10,900 --> 03:05:12,120
We should not go with it.

3533
03:05:13,520 --> 03:05:15,700
I think we take a gamble here.

3534
03:05:16,200 --> 03:05:16,400
Okay.

3535
03:05:16,400 --> 03:05:16,700
Yeah.

3536
03:05:17,420 --> 03:05:19,880
And I think we go towards docks.

3537
03:05:19,980 --> 03:05:20,160
Okay.

3538
03:05:21,040 --> 03:05:22,280
I believe in your gambles.

3539
03:05:23,040 --> 03:05:24,160
We have nothing left to lose.

3540
03:05:24,380 --> 03:05:25,540
We're literally...

3541
03:05:25,540 --> 03:05:26,940
We have nothing left to lose.

3542
03:05:27,080 --> 03:05:27,880
We have to believe.

3543
03:05:28,060 --> 03:05:28,660
No, we do.

3544
03:05:28,820 --> 03:05:29,720
We have something to lose.

3545
03:05:29,980 --> 03:05:30,260
Greek, man.

3546
03:05:30,500 --> 03:05:30,660
Okay.

3547
03:05:31,880 --> 03:05:34,180
We have one thing specifically that we can lose.

3548
03:05:34,220 --> 03:05:35,600
We have only one thing to lose.

3549
03:05:35,660 --> 03:05:37,040
There's a charge rifle right here at tempo.

3550
03:05:37,720 --> 03:05:38,480
Oh, I got one.

3551
03:05:39,380 --> 03:05:39,920
Oh, go.

3552
03:05:40,280 --> 03:05:40,680
Nice.

3553
03:05:40,880 --> 03:05:42,400
He has the one thing he needs.

3554
03:05:43,000 --> 03:05:43,940
Wasn't there a scalper somewhere?

3555
03:05:45,920 --> 03:05:46,660
On the lumbar.

3556
03:05:47,220 --> 03:05:48,180
I don't know where the sculpture was.

3557
03:05:48,280 --> 03:05:49,000
I have no idea.

3558
03:05:49,180 --> 03:05:49,960
I haven't seen one.

3559
03:05:50,440 --> 03:05:51,480
They had dropped it off my repeater.

3560
03:05:51,580 --> 03:05:52,740
Where the fuck did I put my repeater though?

3561
03:05:52,860 --> 03:05:53,620
Oh my god, I'm a mess right now.

3562
03:05:55,180 --> 03:05:55,760
Oh no.

3563
03:05:56,160 --> 03:05:56,440
Oh no.

3564
03:05:56,540 --> 03:05:57,860
No, you can't be a mess right now.

3565
03:05:58,440 --> 03:05:59,380
You know, I'm freaking out.

3566
03:05:59,460 --> 03:05:59,780
I'm freaking out.

3567
03:05:59,840 --> 03:06:00,140
I'm freaking out.

3568
03:06:00,240 --> 03:06:00,820
Don't freak out.

3569
03:06:00,920 --> 03:06:01,720
There's a repeater right here.

3570
03:06:01,860 --> 03:06:03,760
It's just, it's a hammer point though.

3571
03:06:03,960 --> 03:06:04,440
Oh yeah, here.

3572
03:06:04,880 --> 03:06:05,540
Okay, okay.

3573
03:06:05,540 --> 03:06:06,080
Found it.

3574
03:06:06,320 --> 03:06:06,840
I was like, good.

3575
03:06:06,840 --> 03:06:07,600
I'm not moving.

3576
03:06:08,100 --> 03:06:12,380
I'm so focused on the zone now that I just like, I'm just so
locked.

3577
03:06:12,460 --> 03:06:13,720
All right, let's go towards, let's go towards docks.

3578
03:06:14,220 --> 03:06:15,020
We don't have an evac tower.

3579
03:06:15,180 --> 03:06:16,320
Any evac tower friends?

3580
03:06:16,480 --> 03:06:16,680
Nope.

3581
03:06:17,120 --> 03:06:18,340
Okay, I'm going to cut you back then.

3582
03:06:18,980 --> 03:06:23,320
I've only had a chance to look at one evac tower and we died
really early on.

3583
03:06:23,980 --> 03:06:25,380
And the drop killed us.

3584
03:06:27,120 --> 03:06:27,780
All right.

3585
03:06:28,940 --> 03:06:29,480
Yeah, I'm ready.

3586
03:06:30,020 --> 03:06:31,020
Let's move on through, guys.

3587
03:06:31,200 --> 03:06:31,880
Let's do it.

3588
03:06:32,460 --> 03:06:32,920
Friendship.

3589
03:06:33,360 --> 03:06:33,680
Yay.

3590
03:06:35,340 --> 03:06:36,340
Hey, hey, hey.

3591
03:06:36,680 --> 03:06:37,700
Sound a little worse, dude.

3592
03:06:40,480 --> 03:06:40,860
Almost.

3593
03:06:42,240 --> 03:06:43,160
I love it.

3594
03:06:44,340 --> 03:06:46,640
We're doing so well.

3595
03:06:47,400 --> 03:06:48,300
I don't know.

3596
03:06:48,520 --> 03:06:48,980
I don't know.

3597
03:06:49,640 --> 03:06:49,700
Okay.

3598
03:06:49,780 --> 03:06:49,900
All right.

3599
03:06:50,140 --> 03:06:50,780
Keep on moving, guys.

3600
03:06:51,020 --> 03:06:51,380
Okay.

3601
03:06:51,520 --> 03:06:53,300
I'm not going to look up.

3602
03:06:53,740 --> 03:06:54,580
No, we're good.

3603
03:06:54,880 --> 03:06:56,020
We're not going to look up.

3604
03:06:57,440 --> 03:06:58,720
I 100% just picked the wrong perk.

3605
03:06:58,940 --> 03:06:59,140
We're good.

3606
03:06:59,320 --> 03:06:59,640
I'm looking.

3607
03:07:00,100 --> 03:07:00,700
Oh, whoa.

3608
03:07:01,040 --> 03:07:02,400
I hear an evac tower in front of us.

3609
03:07:02,700 --> 03:07:03,080
That's good.

3610
03:07:03,840 --> 03:07:03,980

03:07:07,040 --> 03:07:07,160
Yeah.

3614
03:07:07,160 --> 03:07:07,500
Like, why me?

3615
03:07:07,620 --> 03:07:08,160

03:07:08,480 --> 03:07:08,700
Yeah, we're good.

3617
03:07:09,760 --> 03:07:10,280
Keep moving.

3618
03:07:10,420 --> 03:07:10,540
Keep moving.

3619
03:07:14,220 --> 03:07:15,320
I hear a fight to my left.

3620
03:07:15,840 --> 03:07:16,100
Yeah, yeah.

I'm walking forward.

3624
03:07:19,060 --> 03:07:20,960
I said they're taking the thing up now.

3625
03:07:21,340 --> 03:07:21,680
That's okay.

3626
03:07:21,840 --> 03:07:22,120
We're good.

3627
03:07:22,860 --> 03:07:23,680
We're just chilling here.

3628
03:07:23,860 --> 03:07:24,500
We're going to move up.

3629
03:07:24,500 --> 03:07:25,420
We're going to move up.

3630
03:07:25,420 --> 03:07:26,100
I just want these guys to leave.

3631
03:07:26,280 --> 03:07:26,580

03:07:28,080 --> 03:07:28,620
All right, they're leaving.

3636
03:07:29,420 --> 03:07:30,860

3640
03:07:34,240 --> 03:07:35,500

03:07:36,000 --> 03:07:36,280
Bamboozle.

We can play this pillar too if we need to.

3658
03:07:56,160 --> 03:07:56,640
We're okay.

3659
03:07:58,240 --> 03:07:58,780

03:08:09,100 --> 03:08:09,620
We're okay.

3668
03:08:10,220 --> 03:08:10,800
Just play slow.

3669
03:08:11,160 --> 03:08:11,680
Play slow.

3670
03:08:11,880 --> 03:08:12,140
We're fine.

3671
03:08:12,300 --> 03:08:12,920
There's a fence.

3672
03:08:13,140 --> 03:08:14,360
You are left here too.

3673
03:08:14,960 --> 03:08:15,700
We're vibing.

3674
03:08:15,900 --> 03:08:16,260
Just vibing.

03:08:16,620 --> 03:08:17,180
We're so good.

3676
03:08:17,180 --> 03:08:17,960
Oh, I'm so good.

3677
03:08:18,020 --> 03:08:18,740
I feel so healthy.

3678
03:08:19,440 --> 03:08:19,940
We're so good.

3679
03:08:19,960 --> 03:08:21,200
I feel very healthy right now.

3680
03:08:21,740 --> 03:08:23,000
I'm so vibing.

3681
03:08:23,120 --> 03:08:23,940
It's not even funny, guys.

3682
03:08:24,080 --> 03:08:24,620
Oh, my God.

3683
03:08:25,180 --> 03:08:25,440
I'm dead.

3684
03:08:25,680 --> 03:08:26,140
No, we're alive.

3685
03:08:26,300 --> 03:08:26,420
I'm good.

3686
03:08:26,720 --> 03:08:26,840
No, no.

3687
03:08:26,920 --> 03:08:27,420
You're good.

3688
03:08:27,520 --> 03:08:27,760
You're good.

3689
03:08:27,920 --> 03:08:28,120
You're good.

3690
03:08:28,780 --> 03:08:29,720
I'm looking to my right.

3691
03:08:30,240 --> 03:08:31,480
Live the fuck out, bro.

3692
03:08:33,060 --> 03:08:33,400
I'm alive.

3693
03:08:33,540 --> 03:08:33,740
I'm dead.

3694
03:08:34,420 --> 03:08:35,680
We're okay, I think.

3695
03:08:35,680 --> 03:08:36,820
Oh, this is the...

3696
03:08:36,820 --> 03:08:37,460
I don't know, man.

3697
03:08:37,740 --> 03:08:39,160
I don't feel very comfortable here.

3698
03:08:39,240 --> 03:08:40,680
I feel very exposed for some reason.

3699
03:08:41,360 --> 03:08:42,860
We're going to wait for my old team to try to go up here.

3700
03:08:43,000 --> 03:08:43,240
Okay.

3701
03:08:43,840 --> 03:08:44,320
On that house.

3702
03:08:44,540 --> 03:08:45,260
What do you guys stay here?

3703
03:08:45,580 --> 03:08:45,940
I'm going to...

3704
03:08:45,940 --> 03:08:47,140
There's people literally right here.

3705
03:08:48,260 --> 03:08:49,120
Oh, my God.

3706
03:08:49,160 --> 03:08:50,080
What is this mirage doing?

3707
03:08:50,180 --> 03:08:51,500
How is he able to sit out here, man?

3708

Okay, that's fine.

3710

We're good.

3711
03:08:56,100 --> 03:08:56,660
We're vibing.

3712
03:09:01,760 --> 03:09:02,480

03:09:02,960 --> 03:09:03,080
We're good.

3715
03:09:03,080 --> 03:09:03,800
We're just really loud.

3716
03:09:05,020 --> 03:09:05,740
Chill out.

3717
03:09:06,020 --> 03:09:06,480
Yeah, I mean.

03:09:07,460 --> 03:09:08,480
I'm stressed to fall down.

3719
03:09:08,780 --> 03:09:10,080
I'm so stressed out.

3720
03:09:10,220 --> 03:09:12,380
I'm so stressed out, but we're not 20th.

3721
03:09:12,440 --> 03:09:13,600
We're not 20th.

3722

I'm pre-firing, no one's there.

3740
03:09:50,300 --> 03:09:51,100
There's no save.

3745
03:09:59,020 --> 03:10:00,140
They don't shoot us.

3746
03:10:00,320 --> 03:10:00,760

lot we need to look at the only issue here that i'm the only

3779
03:12:09,760 --> 03:12:15,600
issue we have like genuinely is if this team above us just
the zone like pulls up more and they're the only team inside

3780
03:12:15,600 --> 03:12:21,560
docks then they could oh they're not they're getting shot

3784
03:12:36,520 --> 03:12:38,200
Yo, you're so good.

3785
03:12:41,820 --> 03:12:43,600
I'm just going to stay here still.

3786
03:12:43,900 --> 03:12:45,480
I'm going to stay here.

3787
03:12:45,940 --> 03:12:47,200
There's people all over the room.

3788
03:12:47,240 --> 03:12:48,940
We did get fucked over like pretty hard again.

3789
03:12:49,200 --> 03:12:49,780
Like every time.

3790
03:12:49,900 --> 03:12:54,240
I think like I think I think everybody bullied us out of a
good POI.

3791
03:12:54,620 --> 03:12:56,220
That's exactly what it is.

3792
03:12:56,500 --> 03:12:58,600
I think that's what happened.

3793
03:13:00,000 --> 03:13:01,520
Everybody just kicked us out.

3794
03:13:01,900 --> 03:13:03,700
They're like, OK, nice week put geyser.

3795
03:13:03,820 --> 03:13:04,820
They're like, I'm not sure.

3796
03:13:04,840 --> 03:13:05,760
All right, yeah, they could have that.

3797
03:13:05,900 --> 03:13:06,660
They're like, nice to have that.

3798
03:13:07,100 --> 03:13:08,300
They're like, all right, we'll take that for them.

3799
03:13:08,740 --> 03:13:11,660
And they're like, oh, it's nice to make that's on there.

3800
03:13:11,760 --> 03:13:13,100
Like, I mean.

3801
03:13:13,520 --> 03:13:14,500
They don't even have a pro on their team.

3802
03:13:14,700 --> 03:13:15,520
Yeah, they don't even have a pro.

3803
03:13:15,600 --> 03:13:17,780
They literally have a platform and a diamond.

3804
03:13:18,480 --> 03:13:19,480
And another plot.

3805
03:13:19,840 --> 03:13:20,640
I'm moving plot.

3806
03:13:22,200 --> 03:13:24,340
They literally had three plot players.

3807
03:13:24,940 --> 03:13:26,320
Okay, where's the moment of truth, guys?

3808
03:13:27,580 --> 03:13:29,040
Why is team 14 still?

3809
03:13:30,380 --> 03:13:31,700
Wait, but this is your tournament.

3810
03:13:31,840 --> 03:13:33,840
How did you let these people fucking...

3811
03:13:35,240 --> 03:13:42,040
god the zone pulls back okay this is gonna be the craziest
thing i ever said we should get middle of fight night like

3812
03:13:42,040 --> 03:13:48,960
inside fight night yes how do we run past everybody i mean i
get this vehicle we queue in there or i'm boosting there

3813
03:13:48,960 --> 03:13:58,660

you come over here yeah get right where tempo is okay okay i

3814
03:13:58,660 --> 03:14:03,780

because it's funnier okay there's he okay i'm ready christ

3815
03:14:04,840 --> 03:14:09,420
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go,
go, go, go.

3816
03:14:09,420 --> 03:14:11,180
Get out, get out, get out, get out, go, get out, go.

3817
03:14:11,360 --> 03:14:12,660
No, I got you.

3818
03:14:13,160 --> 03:14:14,440
It's a whole squad.

3819
03:14:15,040 --> 03:14:15,860
Why is there a whole squad there?

3820
03:14:15,860 --> 03:14:16,160
You run.

3821
03:14:16,500 --> 03:14:17,000
Get away, Doki.

3822
03:14:17,280 --> 03:14:17,560
Get away.

3823
03:14:17,720 --> 03:14:19,160
You can crack this run.

3824
03:14:20,840 --> 03:14:22,620
I'm getting punched already.

3825
03:14:26,260 --> 03:14:27,380
Why is there a whole squad?

3826
03:14:27,440 --> 03:14:28,020
I'm taking the port.

3827
03:14:28,620 --> 03:14:28,860
Oh, wait.

3828
03:14:29,180 --> 03:14:29,640
That's not it.

3829
03:14:29,920 --> 03:14:31,060
Why is there a whole?

3830
03:14:32,560 --> 03:14:34,020
There's not a team inside.

3831
03:14:34,840 --> 03:14:36,980
There's already a full team inside.

3832
03:14:37,460 --> 03:14:39,400
Wig, I don't think we should have done that, Wig.

3833
03:14:40,560 --> 03:14:41,160
Wait, where is he?

3834
03:14:41,200 --> 03:14:41,680
You live?

3835
03:14:43,120 --> 03:14:44,400
You might be able to craft that.

3836
03:14:44,420 --> 03:14:45,800
I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive.

3837
03:14:46,600 --> 03:14:52,640
All I'm saying is that, Wig, I think you might have made the
wrong decision.

3838
03:14:53,280 --> 03:14:56,020
I mean, why is there a full team with an Arc Star there?

3839
03:14:56,420 --> 03:14:56,860
Why?

3840
03:14:57,440 --> 03:14:59,060
Someone please tell me why.

3841
03:15:01,080 --> 03:15:02,400
That is unbelievable.

3842
03:15:03,580 --> 03:15:04,740
Wait, you have no white mats?

3843
03:15:04,840 --> 03:15:05,540
No!

3844
03:15:05,680 --> 03:15:06,720
You have zero!

3845
03:15:07,140 --> 03:15:07,840
Land turbine!

3846
03:15:09,300 --> 03:15:10,260
I have nothing!

3847
03:15:10,980 --> 03:15:12,500
How do you have no zero?

3848
03:15:12,520 --> 03:15:13,160
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

3849
03:15:13,240 --> 03:15:15,860
You just gotta last until 14 dies.

3850
03:15:16,060 --> 03:15:16,420
Team 14 dies!

3851
03:15:16,420 --> 03:15:16,600
Team 14 dies!

3852
03:15:16,700 --> 03:15:17,000
Team 14 dies!

3853
03:15:17,000 --> 03:15:17,600
Nothing matters anymore!

3854
03:15:17,920 --> 03:15:18,060
You did?

3855
03:15:18,300 --> 03:15:19,140
Nothing matters!

3856
03:15:19,520 --> 03:15:22,100
We're- We're- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

3857
03:15:22,180 --> 03:15:23,120
We can beat Deeds.

3858
03:15:23,420 --> 03:15:28,040
If you get- Uh, 12, 9, 7, 5.

3859
03:15:28,360 --> 03:15:30,060
Okay, if you get top 5, we beat Deeds.

3860
03:15:30,860 --> 03:15:31,100
Okay.

3861
03:15:31,320 --> 03:15:33,500
The second, the person above us.

3862
03:15:34,060 --> 03:15:34,360
Yay.

3863
03:15:34,840 --> 03:15:35,740
Oh my god.

3864
03:15:35,740 --> 03:15:39,980
The person up with a team above us and we beat.

3865
03:15:43,420 --> 03:15:46,040
Oh my god, the fucking riskiest reload of your life.

3866
03:15:46,500 --> 03:15:48,220
After the audio play, there's no idea I'm here.

3867
03:15:51,400 --> 03:15:57,620
You know, okay, maybe we should like not listen to something
that I was like, but it would be so funny.

3868
03:15:57,860 --> 03:15:59,020
Like maybe that's just not...

3869
03:15:59,780 --> 03:16:02,300
Yeah, but like who else smiled during that?

3870
03:16:02,500 --> 03:16:03,060
No one else?

3871
03:16:03,460 --> 03:16:03,900
We didn't.

3872
03:16:03,920 --> 03:16:04,720
I got stuck.

3873
03:16:04,840 --> 03:16:06,500
My god, I...

3874
03:16:06,500 --> 03:16:07,560
You got fucked already.

3875
03:16:07,760 --> 03:16:09,440
Wait, are you guys stuck or are our car got stuck?

3876
03:16:09,580 --> 03:16:10,400
Because I got hit too.

3877
03:16:11,100 --> 03:16:14,380
Oh, maybe our car got hit and all of us know why are you
peeking?

3878
03:16:14,680 --> 03:16:15,520
Why are you looking at me?

3879
03:16:15,520 --> 03:16:17,100
I didn't know if there's still inside fight later.

3880
03:16:17,180 --> 03:16:18,480
I'm going in there and scrapping.

3881
03:16:18,580 --> 03:16:19,460
You're literally...

3882
03:16:19,460 --> 03:16:20,720
Look at your heels.

3883
03:16:21,680 --> 03:16:25,580
The fact that you have the confidence to even look at
somebody.

3884
03:16:27,640 --> 03:16:29,240
At least I'm fucking dead regardless.

3885
03:16:30,560 --> 03:16:32,720
I'm fucking dead in this next zone for sure.

3886
03:16:33,260 --> 03:16:34,620
You don't know that.

3887
03:16:36,300 --> 03:16:48,700

Holy shit.

3893
03:17:10,800 --> 03:17:12,220
I did not know to play next week.

3894
03:17:12,360 --> 03:17:13,540
I do not have enough time to prep for that.

3895
03:17:13,740 --> 03:17:16,200
We are playing next week, guys.

3896
03:17:16,240 --> 03:17:17,020
Oh, we're so far.

3897
03:17:17,180 --> 03:17:17,620
We're just good.

3898
03:17:17,720 --> 03:17:18,080
This is good.

3899
03:17:18,200 --> 03:17:18,760
People are dying.

3900
03:17:19,900 --> 03:17:20,500
There's no one middle.

3901
03:17:20,680 --> 03:17:21,000
Do I go middle?

3902
03:17:21,880 --> 03:17:22,140
Do it.

3903
03:17:22,140 --> 03:17:22,860
Do it.

3904
03:17:22,860 --> 03:17:23,540
Do it.

3905
03:17:23,540 --> 03:17:23,840
Do it.

3906
03:17:24,100 --> 03:17:24,400
Do it.

3907
03:17:24,840 --> 03:17:25,380
There's heels.

3908
03:17:29,060 --> 03:17:30,100
There's my box on my left.

3909
03:17:30,160 --> 03:17:30,460
On the left.

3910
03:17:30,520 --> 03:17:30,760
That's me.

3911
03:17:30,880 --> 03:17:31,100
That's me.

3912
03:17:31,420 --> 03:17:31,920
Right, right, right, right.

3913
03:17:34,840 --> 03:17:35,940
I'm nervous about them punching me in their face.

3914
03:17:36,560 --> 03:17:36,980
Just heal.

3915
03:17:38,520 --> 03:17:39,280
There's heals here.

3916
03:17:40,780 --> 03:17:41,660
No, you can't heal inside.

3917
03:17:42,300 --> 03:17:42,820
No, you can't.

3918
03:17:43,520 --> 03:17:43,940
Yeah, yeah.

3919
03:17:44,000 --> 03:17:44,920
What the fuck do you mean?

3920
03:17:45,200 --> 03:17:45,540
I've...

3921
03:17:45,540 --> 03:17:45,920
Hey, chill.

3922
03:17:46,220 --> 03:17:46,680
Nadi, chill.

3923
03:17:46,760 --> 03:17:47,100
Nadi, chill.

3924
03:17:47,580 --> 03:17:47,960
Just leave.

3925
03:17:48,120 --> 03:17:48,320
Just leave.

3926
03:17:48,520 --> 03:17:48,600
Just leave.

3927
03:17:48,700 --> 03:17:48,900
Just heal.

3928
03:17:49,000 --> 03:17:49,480
Just heal.

3929
03:17:49,840 --> 03:17:50,480
It's you have time.

3930
03:17:50,500 --> 03:17:51,300
I know, but they're going to push.

3931
03:17:51,480 --> 03:17:52,500
They're going to come in here and bring it.

3932
03:17:52,680 --> 03:17:53,380
They're not going to pull.

3933
03:17:53,380 --> 03:17:54,620
And the other team's going to come in there.

3934
03:17:55,040 --> 03:17:56,680
Yeah, and then you watch these two come inside.

3935
03:17:57,120 --> 03:17:58,160
They scare each other out.

3936
03:17:58,380 --> 03:17:58,860
You're safe.

3937
03:17:59,320 --> 03:17:59,580
Yeah.

3938
03:17:59,800 --> 03:18:00,220
Yeah, there's...

3939
03:18:00,220 --> 03:18:03,060
No one can come in because the moment they come in, someone
else will come in.

3940
03:18:03,060 --> 03:18:03,540
Yeah.

3941
03:18:03,860 --> 03:18:04,820
It's a scare tactic.

3942
03:18:05,440 --> 03:18:06,460
Oh, they're just trying to scare you.

3943
03:18:06,580 --> 03:18:06,820
I'm fucking dead.

3944
03:18:06,900 --> 03:18:07,300
I'm talking dead.

3945
03:18:07,600 --> 03:18:07,820
I'm trying to scare you.

3946
03:18:08,080 --> 03:18:09,040
Oh, my God.

3947
03:18:09,520 --> 03:18:11,080
What the fuck just happened to me?

3948
03:18:13,200 --> 03:18:14,140
Stop dead!

3949
03:18:14,660 --> 03:18:15,640
Let's go!

3950
03:18:16,520 --> 03:18:17,800
You got lost.

3951
03:18:19,080 --> 03:18:21,260
You got lost so hard.

3952
03:18:21,380 --> 03:18:22,840
What the fuck was that?

3953
03:18:22,900 --> 03:18:24,060
What happened to me?

3954
03:18:24,220 --> 03:18:25,540
What was that?

3955
03:18:25,840 --> 03:18:26,800
I'm getting crazy, though.

3956
03:18:26,900 --> 03:18:27,620
Top 10 show gets me.

3957
03:18:28,140 --> 03:18:28,720
No, it's okay.

3958
03:18:28,880 --> 03:18:29,900
We're above Greek.

3959
03:18:30,580 --> 03:18:31,500
Oh, my God.

3960
03:18:31,540 --> 03:18:33,040
We actually got art in the car.

3961
03:18:33,060 --> 03:18:34,680
We were above Greek.

3962
03:18:34,940 --> 03:18:35,960
That's all that matters.

3963
03:18:36,420 --> 03:18:36,440
Man.

3964
03:18:36,980 --> 03:18:37,720
You know what crazy there?

3965
03:18:37,840 --> 03:18:41,220
If that team's just not there to sing with an R star, we
actually probably could get like a top five again.

3966
03:18:41,360 --> 03:18:43,220
Yeah, we- It's actually insane how bad our luck is.

3967
03:18:43,560 --> 03:18:43,560
Unreal.

3968
03:18:44,260 --> 03:18:44,520
Yeah, yeah.

3969
03:18:44,860 --> 03:18:49,100
I'm just saying, wait, the next time you headline, the next
time you headline.

3970
03:18:49,100 --> 03:18:50,020
No, I call it POIs.

3971
03:18:50,200 --> 03:18:51,120
I'm getting the POI out there.

3972
03:18:51,140 --> 03:18:52,320
Next time you have an idea.

3973
03:18:53,720 --> 03:18:57,600
Next time you have an idea, go against that idea as well.

3974
03:18:57,700 --> 03:18:59,320
Oh, no, what the?

3975
03:19:00,940 --> 03:19:02,960
Every idea I have, just make it the opposite.

3976
03:19:03,060 --> 03:19:13,920
that is insane i can't believe the headliner got bullied out
of their po i that is insane

3977
03:19:17,220 --> 03:19:24,140
to be fair it's good that we got it you know it's good that
we finally got team practice you know 100 without a doubt

3978
03:19:24,140 --> 03:19:30,780
because if we did it before challenges circuit i think it
would have been even worse wait what are we playing for

3979
03:19:30,780 --> 03:19:35,580
challenges circuit i mean listen let's My brain is fried
after these six games.

3980
03:19:35,700 --> 03:19:36,720
I can build the IG.

3981
03:19:36,720 --> 03:19:40,980
I just told us to get in three-man Trident and boosted the
fight night.

3982
03:19:41,460 --> 03:19:44,480
I mean, if I really capable of IG only, I didn't want this
player out.

3983
03:19:48,620 --> 03:19:52,240
Okay, but also remember where you took us before we were in
the Trident.

3984
03:19:53,580 --> 03:19:54,860
That was even, that was good.

3985
03:19:54,980 --> 03:19:56,820
We were, I think we were safe down there.

3986
03:19:56,960 --> 03:19:57,520
I did too.

3987
03:19:57,600 --> 03:19:59,300
If the zone pulled off, we were good.

3988
03:19:59,480 --> 03:20:00,700
I did not feel safe.

3989
03:20:00,840 --> 03:20:01,600
I 100%.

3990
03:20:01,600 --> 03:20:03,920
I mean, if we just had a fucking beacon.

3991
03:20:04,180 --> 03:20:06,340
I did not feel safe at all.

3992
03:20:07,000 --> 03:20:08,280
One time we had to...

3993
03:20:08,280 --> 03:20:12,380
Do you understand that in order to get a beacon today, we
just had to send Tempo over to Harvestor?

3994
03:20:12,920 --> 03:20:14,180
That was the only time we had a beacon.

3995
03:20:14,180 --> 03:20:19,880
We just dropped a literal manager of an esports team solo at
a POI to get a beacon.

3996
03:20:20,100 --> 03:20:21,780
We didn't even get a single beacon.

3997
03:20:22,000 --> 03:20:23,260
That's actually crazy.

3998
03:20:23,640 --> 03:20:24,640
That is crazy.

3999
03:20:25,180 --> 03:20:27,960
All six games, we had zero beacons.

4000
03:20:28,460 --> 03:20:31,460
We just played this game on a hard difficulty, literally
veteran mode.

4001
03:20:32,220 --> 03:20:34,120
I'm gonna fucking mac again, god damn it.

4002
03:20:35,300 --> 03:20:36,020
Fuck me.

4003
03:20:36,100 --> 03:20:37,580
That's actually insane.

4004
03:20:37,940 --> 03:20:38,380
That's insane.

4005
03:20:39,180 --> 03:20:39,480
That's insane.

4006
03:20:41,720 --> 03:20:43,240
We had one game of beacon, right?

4007
03:20:43,320 --> 03:20:43,680
What was it?

4008
03:20:43,800 --> 03:20:44,420
No, we didn't.

4009
03:20:44,520 --> 03:20:46,060
We had to walk over to the beacon.

4010
03:20:46,700 --> 03:20:47,200
Oh, no, no.

4011
03:20:47,240 --> 03:20:48,060
We had one in Jurassic.

4012
03:20:48,200 --> 03:20:49,500
Oh, yeah, Jurassic, yeah.

4013
03:20:49,720 --> 03:20:50,640
One out of five, baby.

4014
03:20:51,140 --> 03:20:52,140
One out of five.

4015
03:20:53,080 --> 03:20:54,900
Didn't we get fucked over in Jurassic still?

4016
03:20:55,640 --> 03:20:56,460
No, we didn't.

4017
03:20:56,680 --> 03:20:57,540
We did pretty well.

4018
03:20:57,640 --> 03:20:58,160
We did pretty well.

4019
03:20:58,160 --> 03:20:59,640
We just needed a cat wall.

4020
03:20:59,740 --> 03:21:00,520
We would have made like top five.

4021
03:21:00,680 --> 03:21:00,780
Yeah.

4022
03:21:01,600 --> 03:21:12,140
that's my bad yeah we had a you know what in the end we we
were we had a good bye honestly i actually had so much fun i

4029
03:22:07,580 --> 03:22:15,760

also if he's getting 20th then he didn't have a vibe squad

4030
03:22:15,760 --> 03:22:24,240

fun part he didn't take a trident into a full team wait dude

4031
03:22:24,240 --> 03:22:27,420
come on man he had no idea there was a team there

4032
03:22:31,600 --> 03:22:38,120
so fast I didn't even know what happened I did things were
going to be bad because the moment the one the thing you

4033
03:22:38,120 --> 03:22:46,100
said was I'm gonna do something that might not be a good
idea but it'll be really funny that's what you said I mean I

4034
03:22:46,100 --> 03:22:53,280
sent you alone to 1v3 fistfight inside of fight night that's
pretty funny you were getting your ass beat inside of fight

4035
03:22:53,280 --> 03:22:53,980
night 1v3

4036
03:22:58,300 --> 03:23:02,380
at least at least we got the content out There's no way.

4037
03:23:05,040 --> 03:23:06,460
We got real content.

4038
03:23:06,940 --> 03:23:07,540
We had real content.

4039
03:23:07,660 --> 03:23:09,400
No other team had as much fun as us.

4040
03:23:09,940 --> 03:23:10,900
Who is this winning right now?

4041
03:23:11,740 --> 03:23:12,020
I don't know.

4042
03:23:12,060 --> 03:23:13,380
This team winning might have a good time.

4043
03:23:15,780 --> 03:23:16,960
They just wasted all their grenades.

4044
03:23:18,160 --> 03:23:18,960
They're not even pushing over it.

4045
03:23:19,040 --> 03:23:19,700
Why did they just waste all their grenades?

4046
03:23:19,820 --> 03:23:20,840
This is the watch party.

4047
03:23:21,000 --> 03:23:22,100
This is your watch party, Tad.

4048
03:23:22,620 --> 03:23:22,940
Exactly.

4049
03:23:23,580 --> 03:23:26,120
Look, Wig wanted to die early so he could watch party.

4050
03:23:26,200 --> 03:23:26,760
In-game watch party.

4051
03:23:26,760 --> 03:23:27,420
Yeah, here you go, Chad.

4052
03:23:27,460 --> 03:23:27,760
Look at that.

4053
03:23:27,860 --> 03:23:28,800
And the win is going to go.

4054
03:23:29,000 --> 03:23:29,440
Going on.

4055
03:23:29,820 --> 03:23:30,140

4061
03:23:42,100 --> 03:23:43,200
Oh, Jen, yeah, Jen won.

4062
03:23:43,560 --> 03:23:45,040
Wait, do you actually memorize the skins?

4063
03:23:45,900 --> 03:23:48,520
Wasn't he like first place by like 30 points going on this?

4064
03:23:48,520 --> 03:23:48,640
Yeah.

4065
03:23:49,140 --> 03:23:49,460
Yeah.

4066
03:23:49,620 --> 03:23:51,380
So did he just win by like 50 points?

4067
03:23:51,600 --> 03:23:52,640
Like 100 points?

4068
03:23:53,300 --> 03:23:55,020
Holy shit, with girl too.

03:23:57,840 --> 03:23:58,860
That was not us, guys.

4072
03:23:58,960 --> 03:24:00,100
I wonder what that's like.

4073
03:24:01,600 --> 03:24:11,420
feel that yo we will challenge your circuit i don't think
we'll ever know what that feels like we got fucking rich

4074
03:24:11,420 --> 03:24:20,760
guys don't worry look at where team 14 is good we're safe
they didn't we would have been worrying if they got some

4075
03:24:20,760 --> 03:24:29,100
yeah yeah don't worry they had zero kills wait how does team
20 have three kills and they died in 20th i don't know they

4076
03:24:29,100 --> 03:24:35,840
wait what they wait what yeah what the maybe they res maybe
they res they could have got picks and then the the people

4077
03:24:35,840 --> 03:24:45,080
res maybe we did it guys guys what did we get man we had to
get last no we're your second last because because greece

4078
03:24:45,080 --> 03:24:54,520
team never got a single point oh everyone everyone gets the
same amount yeah everyone gets 400 11th to 20th all get same

4079
03:24:54,520 --> 03:24:58,580
amount okay yeah so we're fine it doesn't matter what
technically

4080
03:25:01,600 --> 03:25:11,860
11 place yeah yeah yeah everybody is 11 place so like
technically technically we're all 11 place except for greek

4081
03:25:11,860 --> 03:25:12,540
who's 12.

4082
03:25:14,060 --> 03:25:24,280
what apparently the team above us in docs was greek i was
probably i'm asking they were probably so confused why we

4083
03:25:24,280 --> 03:25:32,620
took the trident left they were probably so dumbfounded that
is unbelievable there's no fucking way he's probably like

4084
03:25:32,620 --> 03:25:44,160
they're taking the fucking trident that's so funny look at
us look at us go i told you guys i told you guys i bet you

4085
03:25:44,160 --> 03:25:53,120
no one had as much fun as us chad this was very good
practice yep challenger circuit agreed yo okay so what did

4086
03:25:53,120 --> 03:25:59,260
we learn today that we're gonna take it to challenger
circuit i think never get beacon so don't bother with a

4087
03:25:59,260 --> 03:26:06,460
controller okay that was not what we learned thank god you
understand what we learned today thank god we are talking

4088
03:26:06,460 --> 03:26:13,340
about this now what we learned that's exactly what we
learned what we learned is that we need a poi with a scan we

4089
03:26:13,340 --> 03:26:21,360
need we need to figure out a poi and even we're gonna get
contested we need we still need to figure out a poi and not

4090
03:26:21,360 --> 03:26:30,760
get bullied out of our poi unlike today like and we need to
figure out what to play because apparently we might be

Are you gonna be interviewed?

4100
03:27:26,140 --> 03:27:26,560
We lost.

4101
03:27:27,200 --> 03:27:30,340
We should be having an interview for like the vibes.

4102
03:27:33,580 --> 03:27:34,420
I can't believe.

4103
03:27:34,540 --> 03:27:35,520
I can't believe we didn't get...

4104
03:27:35,520 --> 03:27:37,040
I can't believe you didn't bring us to the interview.

4105
03:27:37,800 --> 03:27:38,200
I can't.

4106
03:27:40,060 --> 03:27:41,280
Yeah, they should get you on there.

4107
03:27:41,400 --> 03:27:42,560
No, they should have got all of us.

4108
03:27:42,560 --> 03:27:43,960
What was your own strategy today getting 19 placed?

4109
03:27:44,080 --> 03:27:47,380
Well, nice week told me three times to take a trident when I
shouldn't have.

4110
03:27:47,940 --> 03:27:51,460
And, you know, he denied you all correctly one time.

4111
03:27:51,620 --> 03:27:52,860
We had a good time today.

4112
03:27:54,360 --> 03:27:54,660
Yeah.

4113
03:27:55,220 --> 03:28:00,580
He said, like, this was the last thing I heard was, this
might be a really bad idea, but it's going to be funny.

4114
03:28:02,860 --> 03:28:03,280
Yeah.

4115
03:28:03,740 --> 03:28:05,280
He said, this is going to be funny.

4116
03:28:05,420 --> 03:28:06,840
And then none of us laughed afterwards.

4117
03:28:07,220 --> 03:28:08,960
And then we got Arc started.

4118
03:28:09,620 --> 03:28:11,160
I got confused.

4119
03:28:12,120 --> 03:28:13,600
I got so confused.

4120
03:28:13,740 --> 03:28:14,740
I didn't know what was going on.

4121
03:28:14,960 --> 03:28:16,700
All I know is I got stunned.

4122
03:28:17,200 --> 03:28:18,500
And then there was people.

4123
03:28:18,780 --> 03:28:20,160
Temple had a bladder issue too.

4124
03:28:20,160 --> 03:28:29,500
so like honestly we should negate everything that happened
yeah we should just we should just reset the scores oh my

4125
03:28:29,500 --> 03:28:37,700
god reset and then multiply game one by six i don't think
game one was the game that we did the best in it was the

4126
03:28:37,700 --> 03:28:46,340
game four yeah yeah we know we got like we got three maps
out of six huh they won three games out of six jen bernstein

4127
03:28:46,340 --> 03:28:58,140

been me if I was Jen picked me you guys really got every

4128
03:28:58,140 --> 03:29:06,780
game if Jen got you he loses 6 out of 6 there's no way we
should do it we should have like a control group here Jen

4129
03:29:06,780 --> 03:29:15,060
every tournament Jen will pick one of us and then see who
plays is higher it's not going to be me you're at your place

Guys, we did it.

4220
03:35:03,140 --> 03:35:06,780
We're better than the rank one Pred last season.

4221
03:35:07,060 --> 03:35:08,520
Just remember that.

4222
03:35:09,000 --> 03:35:09,540
Any team.

4223
03:35:09,820 --> 03:35:14,300
We're better than the team that was the Hatter rank one
Pred.

4224
03:35:18,420 --> 03:35:20,100
That's all it takes.

4225
03:35:21,740 --> 03:35:22,620
Oh my god.

4226
03:35:23,380 --> 03:35:24,240
Look, last look.

4227
03:35:24,600 --> 03:35:26,640
It's because the current season doesn't have rank one yet.

4228
03:35:26,800 --> 03:35:29,180
We don't know who's the current rank one pred yet this
season.

4229
03:35:29,860 --> 03:35:30,780
We don't know.

4230
03:35:32,920 --> 03:35:35,660
We don't know, so it doesn't matter, chat.

4231
03:35:36,860 --> 03:35:38,500
Yeah, because it hasn't ended yet.

4232
03:35:38,740 --> 03:35:41,700
We're the God's strongest plan.

4233
03:35:41,760 --> 03:35:42,280
No, it didn't.

4234
03:35:42,340 --> 03:35:42,700
What do you mean?

4235
03:35:42,760 --> 03:35:43,740
The season's still ongoing.

4236
03:35:44,480 --> 03:35:45,520
Is rank season still ongoing?

4237
03:35:45,860 --> 03:35:47,020
It ends next week.

4238
03:35:47,160 --> 03:35:47,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4239
03:35:47,860 --> 03:35:48,760
It's still ongoing.

4240
03:35:49,100 --> 03:35:50,140
Okay, so we're good.

4241
03:35:50,340 --> 03:35:50,900
We're good.

4242
03:35:51,520 --> 03:35:52,620
We're good to go.

4243
03:35:59,040 --> 03:36:01,220
You know, I think we did pretty well.

4244
03:36:01,720 --> 03:36:04,120
I think we did pretty well as a team.

4245
03:36:04,360 --> 03:36:06,960
I had zero expectations.

4246
03:36:07,640 --> 03:36:11,040
I still have zero expectations, but...

4247
03:36:11,640 --> 03:36:14,600
I thought we were going to get in the middle.

4248
03:36:15,140 --> 03:36:17,000
I know it wasn't going to happen.

4249
03:36:17,340 --> 03:36:17,680
I know.

4250
03:36:18,700 --> 03:36:22,360
I mean, with our POIs, there was no way.

4251
03:36:22,460 --> 03:36:24,920
Like, literally, we had zero good POIs.

4252
03:36:25,840 --> 03:36:28,880
We literally got kicked out of all the good POIs.

4253
03:36:29,040 --> 03:36:38,340
the last twitch rivals we did we actually had decent places
to land we actually had let's see that's true let's yeah we

4254
03:36:38,340 --> 03:36:46,560
were we were what grow towers we had loot yeah we had actual
loot and we weren't getting contested this time we we got

4255
03:36:46,560 --> 03:36:55,860

of our areas where is poi it's like um i forgot what was the

teams get to pick where you want to land the landmarks and

other team kicked us out every team kicked us out of the the

03:38:43,440 --> 03:38:44,400
All right, Gigi's Tempo.

4275
03:38:44,400 --> 03:38:45,760
You have to do your schedule, right?

4276

When did you want to play, right?

4280
03:38:51,600 --> 03:38:56,200
I mean, most likely I won't be streaming it because I also
have another Apex tournament, too, other than CC.

4281
03:38:56,680 --> 03:38:58,100
So I don't want to put too many Apex on.

4282
03:38:58,240 --> 03:39:01,200
I'll most likely just play off, like, you guys can stream,
but I'll play off stream.

03:39:01,560 --> 03:39:01,920
Okay.
