00:04:43,340 --> 00:05:10,660
So it was like Non-stop working like we literally didn't stop working since we got there So like we arrived and then like on the first day like I was so okay Okay, maybe like on the first day The first day I could have literally Like done stuff but like on the first day I was so okay I don't know why I was so fucking stupid on the first day.

52
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:34,060
I was like, all right I'm gonna I'm not gonna sleep so I can sleep on the plane Like that was my mindset cuz like I'm used to like like in I'm used to doing long flights So like I always be like, all right, so if I'm gonna be on the plane, I should not sleep and then and Then like so I can be awake It's I can like stay up and then sleep on the plane.

53
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:41,440
Well, I forgot what what I fucking forgot Was that the plane ride was less than four hours?

54
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,580
And I did transfers too.

55
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,600
So like I had to do transfers and stuff.

56
00:05:48,940 --> 00:06:16,580
So like I bought Economy tickets for those two plane rides So like I need you guys to know I haven't been on economy for 10 plus years So like I was like, oh, it's like, you know It's a it's two rat plane ticket rides and there's like if there's a transfer in the middle So I was just like can't be that bad as long as I'm super fucking tired Like I'm super tired.

57
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,240
I can fall asleep right away.

58
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:44,700
Well on my first plane ride the first one The first one, um, not even economy plus it was straight-up economy because I didn't even have to pay for this ticket by the way like I could have I Like I'm saving money and then like I'm remembered I was like wait I'm not even paying for this ticket like the organizers paid for this ticket.

59
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,520
Like why the fuck did I body cut?

60
00:06:46,820 --> 00:07:09,620
Anyway, um Anyway, so like the first one the first ticket right the plane ticket ride I I got the far the like there was no window seat So I got like the far right like, you know the aisle seat because there's three seats So I got the aisle seat and then so but there was a grandma right next to me There was a grandma next to me and um,

61
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:26,700
I don't think it'll be that bad By the way, I I forgot how little how little space you get So so I was like, I'll make it work But like, you know, I just fucking sleep straight up like I was just like, you know, I'm like considerate about like Oh, you can put your seat in the back up and seat you a little bit.

62
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:46,080
But no, I'm like considerate I don't want like people sitting behind me to feel uncomfortable and then it costs like a chain of a Comfortableness cuz then they're like, oh this person in front of me is gonna it's gonna like put your seat back I'm gonna push my seat back and then I cost like a chain there anyway So so I was like,

63
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:58,720
so I I was just like, okay, I'm gonna make this work I'm really fucking tired anyway, because I didn't sleep yet So I was just like like I was like, you know forcing myself to see sleep My neck fucking is not happy about this.

64
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:07,860
So um This grandma woke me up three fucking times Because she needed to use the bathroom.

65
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,460
I oh, okay.

66
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:18,280
No JK two times She woke me up two times because she needed to use the bathroom and I was just like, oh my god.

67
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:22,720
Okay It was already I was not having a great time sleeping on this plane.

68
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:58,460
The third time was because um Because how uncomfortable the seat was like, you know, cuz I'm sleeping up like like the like there's no slanted when you're sleeping economy and the third time was because it's beverages time and the thing is my my neck was not happy with the position of the seat that I My head was like out of the seat like it was like so like it was not out of the seat But it was like slanted to the out to the aisle and then the the flight attendant fucking pushed

69
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:10,440
They're pushing the beverage cart, so they pushed my head back to the seat and I woke up and I just see like beverage cart

70
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:23,600
They're like, you know, they have to push the beverage card They don't like fucking like I hit a run and my fucking neck snaps off because they were serving beverages.

71
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:50,520
So Yeah, I woke up like three times on the first ride the first one I'm like, oh I should have and I remember what my friends was like No, you should get you should get like first class or something Like, you know, it's like you're not even paying for like the because they pay for the economy ticket So they're like it won't even to be that much because like you already got the economy part paid for so you just put an Upgrade I was like,

72
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,740
yeah, but it's like less than four hours.

73
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:57,000
Like I don't What's the point?

74
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,280
Like it's less than four.

75
00:09:58,420 --> 00:09:59,300
I'll be fine.

76
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:03,640
And then my friend was like no You never haven't sat in economy in a long time.

77
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,220
Have you?

78
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:15,740
I Was like it can't be that bad The thing is some of you guys were like, oh we're like it's economy It's not that bad, but you understand I I had the good life.

79
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:20,140
Like I I okay I usually I don't get like first class but because it's like a small plane.

80
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:38,120
They don't have anything beyond they don't have business class they don't have business class because Because it's a small plane because it's like you're only flying to like like a small destination So they only have like one class so I was like so but I never like actually I've only flown first class once in my Life,

81
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:50,580
so like usually I just get business class Like if I want like an actual good time and I do like like 10 plus out I usually do 10 plus I I've always done 10 plus hour flights I haven't done like a super short flight in like long time.

82
00:10:51,040 --> 00:11:04,160
Um, I never I think I rarely ever fly to like I've rarely ever fly to like America so like so like I was like Oh my god, like like how bad can it be like?

83
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,960
But like I know what it's like to be in business class.

84
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:11,600
So I was like, oh, you can't be that bad like

85
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:18,620
Economy plus or like business class so I was like can't be that bad.

86
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:24,180
So so I it was really bad Like I I was so tired.

87
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:47,900
I was so fucking I was so fucking tired on the plane cuz I didn't sleep I didn't sleep and then Then a grandma kept waking me up and then a flight attendant woke me up because my head was in the fucking way of the aisle and then so I was just like oh I was like no,

88
00:11:48,020 --> 00:12:13,260
I I knew the good life It's like it's like when you when you play on 60, okay So for the gamers out there who don't go outside It's like you used to play on 60 frames You used to play on 60 frames or 60 Hertz monitor and then you upgrade Do a hundred two hundred and forty four Hertz monitor for the first time like you can't go back like It's just like that.

89
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:16,100
You literally you literally can't go back.

90
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:34,700
It's so it's like the gap between economy and economy plus like even I would fly economy plus Then a gap between economy and economy plus it's way too much for me And like and then our economy and business class It's just I've seen the light and then like I'm like,

91
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:39,820
I can't I have to keep making money So like I don't have to go back to those times

00:13:54,770 --> 00:14:10,110

117
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:31,570
So I was happy It's so economy by the way on the flight back I got like economy plus which was a lot better like I was actually happy Well, not that happy because on economy plus on the flight back I was the middle seat and like I was the middle seat.

118
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:33,950
I couldn't Okay, JK.

119
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:35,870
No, I remember why I was mad.

120
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:36,850
I was so mad.

121
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:54,350
I May as well just be like terrible too because like even though I have more leg room and like my chair is at least finally slanted I couldn't I I Didn't realize an economy your seats are not slanted.

122
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:56,190
Like how do you live like this?

123
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:14,050
Why is the chair not slanted like I Didn't understand so like anyway, anyway economy the chairs are slanted and it was like a harsh reality for me So like anyway, they call me plus the chairs are slanted.

124
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:25,110
So Yes, our seats are slanted a little and our seats are it's actually crazy our seats are slanted in business class and economy plus but

125
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:45,680
It's a little slanted in economy plus in plus and up It is I swear cuz like I literally didn't call me plus and I was like wow the cheers are not straight this time

126
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:53,800
I was like, wow, these chairs aren't straight up

127
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:02,400
Anyway Slanted is premium.

128
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:25,280
Yeah, like got pay extra for like default slanted seats like Anyway Anyway, so I was like the milsy was fucking terrible, you know why it was even worse because the lady in the the lady in the window seat is like She was like it was her first time flying.

129
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:52,560
I could tell you know, I know why I could tell it was her first time flying because She left the fucking window open and like the Sun was shining through our side of the plane Like like I was sitting on we were sitting on the left side and the Sun was shining on the left side and I was like she was like one of the only person in our row that kept her window open and She was taking photos of the sky

130
00:16:56,110 --> 00:17:07,650
But it wasn't like a one-time thing she was taking multiple photos of the sky Throughout the plane ride and in my head.

131
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:21,550
I was like Fuck is it's the sky Changes like when you ride the plane for the first time like it's like if you've done multiple plane rides, it's the same sky

132
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:32,090
Multiple throughout the plane ride and I was like what's changing nothing is changing outside

133
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:57,550
I Couldn't because the Sun was shining through and I was trying to watch my show And like the thing is because the Sun is shining through My screen was like getting hit by the Sun.

134
00:17:57,670 --> 00:18:02,130
So like So like I wasn't I was like, how do I pass the time?

135
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:05,750
I have to like put the phone I couldn't put the phone on the table.

136
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:19,230

192
00:29:50,800 --> 00:30:12,200
I really like Chinese spicy food so mouth-watering chicken is like basically like cold chicken drenched in chili sauce like it's It's really It's just that it's like Cold chicken and it's all it's just trenchant Chili's chili oil It's just like yes, saliva chicken.

297
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:27,680
but it was all the way near the end.

298
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:29,380

He just like he instantly gave me back my passport and was just like, all right

339
00:51:15,470 --> 00:51:55,550
Anyway, so I was freaking out because like obviously for the the streaming awards it's like more towards twitch streamers, um a lot more geared towards twitch streamers because like um That's where a lot of like the streaming especially in like the west na That's a lot of words like na streamers are on the platform And I was so I I didn't think I'd get nominated and I had like a small hope and that's why I stayed up to watch the nominations being out because I was like what if I am nominated but like what if I want to be watch it live if I was so it was It was so surreal because like there were so many amazing,

340
00:51:55,750 --> 00:52:09,490
you know, amazing content creators that were nominated and see voting matters guys The voting matters for youtubers guys And I was just like Um, I was like I was so surprised.

00:52:21,730 --> 00:52:26,190
I've been through a lot In a year, it's not even been a full year yet.

344
00:52:26,270 --> 00:52:38,990
Like since since we came back in february so It's really crazy to see myself being up there As vtuber of the year when I didn't even come back in january.

345
00:52:38,990 --> 00:52:52,710
I came back in february And the year isn't even over The year isn't even over and like i'm up there with so many like amazing streamers in all the categories Nice, we got nominated too.

We got nominated as as um One of the best uh battle royale streamer Um, so he's up there too.

348
00:53:03,530 --> 00:53:17,370
Like a lot of my friends as well are out there And and it's like it's just super surreal to see And just like so like thank you dragons for nominating me because it's like 70 percent fan voted and 30 percent.

349
00:53:17,370 --> 00:53:27,830
Uh judged by a panel And so thank you guys for the popularity contest vote because like, you know Back in high school and middle school.

350
00:53:27,990 --> 00:54:01,850
I didn't win the popularity contest for like student council So There was always one person that was more popular than me and even though I was smarter um for some of those positions it didn't matter because it was fucking high school and it was all about popular vote like I did I was a student council treasurer but like what I I got a student council treasurer So I was running up against a teacher and a secretary,

351
00:54:02,370 --> 00:54:06,290
but could never get president because I was just not popular enough for president.

352
00:54:07,230 --> 00:54:14,070
I remember one time I tried to run for student council president, and then the person I was running up against... I told this story before.

353
00:54:15,150 --> 00:54:20,450
The person I was running up against was the daughter of the principal.

354
00:54:21,090 --> 00:54:23,910
So like, and she didn't even put any posters out.

355
00:54:24,410 --> 00:54:26,310
She didn't put any posters out.

356
00:54:26,310 --> 00:54:39,490
She was like, in her speech, she was like, you might notice that I don't have any posters or like marketing for my student council presidency campaign.

357
00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:50,390
It's because I'm thinking about the environment, and I'm here, and my platform is that I'm trying to be more environmentally friendly for the student body.

358
00:54:50,730 --> 00:54:54,450
So that's why you didn't see any campaigns about me posted up.

359
00:54:54,450 --> 00:54:55,850
And I'm like, that is so fucking bullshit.

360
00:54:55,910 --> 00:54:56,530
You are lazy.

361
00:54:58,550 --> 00:55:04,170
I was like, in my head, I was like, that's so fucking, I know you're, you were just fucking lazy.

362
00:55:07,710 --> 00:55:09,730
It's not even that much paper.

363
00:55:10,130 --> 00:55:12,310
It's not even that much paper.

364
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:23,260
Anyway, she became the president of the student council.

365
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:34,780
So yeah, anyway, so thank you guys for nominating me.

366
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:41,620
Anyway, because of this, I didn't sleep that much.

367
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:45,540
But apparently not, because she became president.

368
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:48,140
She won the popular vote, apparently not.

369
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:52,220
Not everybody knew, but she won the popular vote still.

370
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,340
I'm still, it's been a long time.

371
00:55:55,460 --> 00:56:00,260
It's been like a long time since high school, and I'm still fucking, I'll still remember her name too.

372
00:56:01,060 --> 00:56:01,580
Maddie.

373
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:08,680
I'll remember you.

374
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:13,680
I'll, I forgot so many other people's names, but I'll remember your name.

375
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:20,220
I don't even remember if that's actually, yeah.

376
00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:20,380
Maddie.

377
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:38,240
Despite, it's been, it's been countless years, and I don't remember like 80% of the people in my class name at that time.

378
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:39,600
But I'll remember her name.

379
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:42,340
I'll remember her name.

380
00:56:42,340 --> 00:56:51,640
I actually don't, I'm like trying, okay, I'm like thinking, do I remember some of the, some of my classmates back then at that year?

381
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:55,000
And I was like, no, there's a lot I don't remember.

382
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:57,620
There's actually a lot of names I don't remember.

383
00:57:03,550 --> 00:57:04,410
What a grudge.

384
00:57:04,990 --> 00:57:06,950
It was the most bullshit thing.

385
00:57:07,350 --> 00:57:11,690
When I heard that speech, I was like, you gotta be fucking kidding me.

386
00:57:13,350 --> 00:57:18,670
When I heard that speech, I was like, you gotta be fucking bullshitting me.

387
00:57:18,750 --> 00:57:21,830
That is so fucking, oh my, that is so bullshit.

388
00:57:22,050 --> 00:57:24,150
I was like, no, there's no way.

389
00:57:24,670 --> 00:57:29,430
You, you did not fucking, that was not your intention.

390
00:57:29,510 --> 00:57:30,230
You were lazy.

391
00:57:30,410 --> 00:57:31,590
I know you were lazy.

392
00:57:38,630 --> 00:57:43,250
That's why I remember, it's so, like, I'm holding this grudge to this day.

393
00:57:43,370 --> 00:57:46,610
Thank you, thank you.

394
00:57:48,430 --> 00:57:50,870
She out-politicianed me.

395
00:57:51,230 --> 00:57:52,910
Yeah, she fucking did.

396
00:57:53,490 --> 00:57:55,050
Like, that's impressive.

397
00:57:57,130 --> 00:58:00,610
I was like, you're already the principal's daughter.

398
00:58:00,610 --> 00:58:03,910
Like, do you really have to, oh my god.

399
00:58:04,110 --> 00:58:13,830
Like, it just, like, rubbed in my face that, like, she's the principal's daughter, so, like, now she can just win.

400
00:58:15,130 --> 00:58:16,650
I'm doing nothing.

401
00:58:17,150 --> 00:58:23,270
I wouldn't, if she did something, if she campaigned a little bit, I wouldn't have been so fucking salty.

402
00:58:23,870 --> 00:58:28,450
I wouldn't, I wouldn't have been, like, so fucking, oh.

403
00:58:28,450 --> 00:58:32,210
If she campaigned even a little bit.

404
00:58:32,270 --> 00:58:34,810
But no, no, she did nothing.

405
00:58:35,250 --> 00:58:38,910
She just went in there being like, I'm the daughter of the principal.

406
00:58:41,950 --> 00:58:52,730
And then she had to lie to my face, being like, I'm just trying to be environmentally conscious about the, that's why I don't want to put any campaign posters out.

407
00:58:53,050 --> 00:58:54,550
Or, like, campaign at all.

408
00:58:54,550 --> 00:58:57,550
Like, anyway.

409
00:58:58,270 --> 00:58:59,510
Code, thank you for the super chat.

410
00:58:59,610 --> 00:59:00,630
Thank you, thank you.

411
00:59:00,950 --> 00:59:04,290
I love how consistently you remember stuff that spikes you specifically.

412
00:59:04,470 --> 00:59:07,030
That's why, oh shit, thank you for the super chat.

413
00:59:07,150 --> 00:59:08,230
Thank you, thank you.

414
00:59:09,130 --> 00:59:10,450
SageN, thank you for the super chat.

415
00:59:10,530 --> 00:59:11,210
Thank you, thank you.

416
00:59:11,910 --> 00:59:12,310
Anyway.

417
00:59:14,790 --> 00:59:15,190
Anyway.

418
00:59:16,590 --> 00:59:18,310
Back to my original story.

419
00:59:18,490 --> 00:59:19,470
Back to my original story.

420
00:59:19,570 --> 00:59:23,750
Sorry, I got a little sidetracked there.

421
00:59:23,750 --> 00:59:27,730
By that girl from a long time ago.

422
00:59:28,090 --> 00:59:33,070
So, obviously, when, you know, I finally, by the way, I just watched it in my category.

423
00:59:33,430 --> 00:59:36,770
And then I closed the stream because it was over.

424
00:59:37,310 --> 00:59:40,490
Because I was like, I got what I fucking wanted finally.

425
00:59:40,650 --> 00:59:41,870
And then I took a nap.

426
00:59:42,510 --> 00:59:44,710
And then I passed out.

427
00:59:45,230 --> 00:59:48,670
And then, so, like, obviously, a lot of time was wasted.

428
00:59:48,910 --> 00:59:51,450
Because I was just so fucking tired.

429
00:59:52,050 --> 00:59:54,370
So, I could have, like, we could have done other stuff.

430
00:59:54,490 --> 00:59:57,890
We could have, like, you know, signed the postcards on the first day.

431
00:59:58,770 --> 01:00:01,530
And, by the way, we didn't get our postcards until day 2.

432
01:00:01,630 --> 01:00:06,110
Because we forgot to, the organizers forgot to give it to us on day 1.

433
01:00:06,190 --> 01:00:07,630
Because we were also, like, super tired.

434
01:00:07,790 --> 01:00:09,850
Like, we were tired from the flight over.

435
01:00:10,750 --> 01:00:12,530
But, yeah, we got the postcards on day 2.

436
01:00:12,550 --> 01:00:13,890
And that's why we were signing.

437
01:00:14,270 --> 01:00:15,490
Because we had signed 200 postcards.

438
01:00:16,670 --> 01:00:19,510
And on day 2, we were given one marker.

439
01:00:20,190 --> 01:00:21,930
Because we were given a pack of markers.

440
01:00:22,250 --> 01:00:25,210
And we were testing out which marker would look the best on the postcard.

441
01:00:25,730 --> 01:00:29,590
And the color we ended up choosing, there was only one of it.

442
01:00:29,770 --> 01:00:32,830
But it was already too late to ask for another one.

443
01:00:33,190 --> 01:00:34,890
Because it was already late at night.

444
01:00:35,270 --> 01:00:38,790
And we're like, well, obviously, we gotta get it on day 2.

445
01:00:39,090 --> 01:00:42,490
So, Min and I, we had to share the marker between us.

446
01:00:42,850 --> 01:00:44,750
So, she would, like, start writing.

447
01:00:44,990 --> 01:00:46,710
And then when she was done, it was my turn.

448
01:00:46,710 --> 01:00:52,030
Like, obviously, that was not very productive.

449
01:00:53,950 --> 01:00:56,850
It was not very productive.

450
01:00:57,090 --> 01:01:00,630
And we were already very tired from dance practice and stuff.

451
01:01:02,550 --> 01:01:08,150
Because in the dance practice, we were also in the 3D stuff, too.

452
01:01:08,210 --> 01:01:10,590
Because we wanted to practice in 3D.

453
01:01:10,590 --> 01:01:17,190
Because dancing without the 3D suits versus in the 3D suits is so different.

454
01:01:17,750 --> 01:01:24,310
And, like, when we were practicing our dances and stuff, we had to change some of the moves.

455
01:01:24,570 --> 01:01:29,430
Because we kept, like, tangling it up on the wires and stuff.

456
01:01:29,910 --> 01:01:31,350
And so, we had to, like...

457
01:01:31,350 --> 01:01:34,550
We were, like, swapping...

458
01:01:34,550 --> 01:01:36,890
We had to practice in the suits and stuff.

459
01:01:36,890 --> 01:01:38,250
So, like, we wouldn't...

460
01:01:38,250 --> 01:01:40,250
Like, we would get used to it and everything.

461
01:01:40,990 --> 01:01:42,690
And then we also, like, didn't...

462
01:01:42,690 --> 01:01:46,050
We had to do the dances where we were both together practicing.

463
01:01:46,290 --> 01:01:52,430
Because now that, you know, we're together, we have to, like, you know, make sure that we were doing the spacing correctly.

464
01:01:52,930 --> 01:01:56,270
And, like, the spacing and the...

465
01:01:56,270 --> 01:02:00,250
And, like, you know, making sure, like, we have, like, interactions and stuff in our dances.

466
01:02:00,290 --> 01:02:02,150
So, we had to make sure everything would be okay.

467
01:02:02,730 --> 01:02:03,670
So, we were doing that.

468
01:02:03,670 --> 01:02:05,130
It was... Oh, my God.

469
01:02:05,170 --> 01:02:05,810
We were at the...

470
01:02:05,810 --> 01:02:07,390
We were practicing for so long.

471
01:02:11,090 --> 01:02:11,970
We were...

472
01:02:11,970 --> 01:02:13,330
It was so tiring.

473
01:02:13,850 --> 01:02:14,250
But, anyway.

474
01:02:14,530 --> 01:02:16,270
So, day one of being there.

475
01:02:19,690 --> 01:02:21,930
I was so... We were... We...

476
01:02:21,930 --> 01:02:25,370
I was so tired that I, like, took a nap right after the VTuber nom...

477
01:02:25,370 --> 01:02:27,230
The VTuber category nomination.

478
01:02:27,730 --> 01:02:29,730
And when I woke up, it was already dinner time.

479
01:02:29,910 --> 01:02:32,410
Well, obviously, they were waiting for me for dinner.

480
01:02:32,410 --> 01:02:33,750
I felt so bad.

481
01:02:33,870 --> 01:02:37,390
I felt so bad because they were waiting for me for dinner.

482
01:02:37,590 --> 01:02:42,470
Because they were like, Hey, Doki, are you awake?

483
01:02:42,570 --> 01:02:43,510
I was like, I'm sorry.

484
01:02:43,670 --> 01:02:44,730
I passed out.

485
01:02:44,890 --> 01:02:46,170
I'm so sorry.

486
01:02:49,070 --> 01:02:50,070
Oh, my God.

487
01:02:50,550 --> 01:02:51,990
Mint got free shoes.

488
01:02:52,330 --> 01:02:54,590
I should have asked for free shoes.

489
01:02:56,170 --> 01:03:00,430
Because, like, we're supposed to have, like, non-reflective sneakers.

490
01:03:00,990 --> 01:03:02,430
And she didn't know.

491
01:03:02,770 --> 01:03:06,010
Because, usually, we're provided the sneakers and stuff.

492
01:03:06,350 --> 01:03:07,430
But this one, we...

493
01:03:08,370 --> 01:03:10,390
She didn't bring any because she thought she was...

494
01:03:10,390 --> 01:03:12,550
They were like, oh, we'll buy you sneakers.

495
01:03:12,870 --> 01:03:14,950
And then I was like, oh, I don't need it.

496
01:03:14,950 --> 01:03:16,050
I already brought my own shoes.

497
01:03:16,130 --> 01:03:18,350
Because I was like, oh, they already spent so much money on us.

498
01:03:18,710 --> 01:03:21,430
And then... So, then when we got to the studio...

499
01:03:23,870 --> 01:03:25,390
My shoes were apparently reflective.

500
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:26,130
I didn't know.

501
01:03:26,230 --> 01:03:27,350
I couldn't tell.

502
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:28,990
I couldn't tell they reflected.

503
01:03:28,990 --> 01:03:31,070
I was like, wait, these are reflected?

504
01:03:31,690 --> 01:03:32,210
And then...

505
01:03:32,650 --> 01:03:35,370
Because, silly me, the Nike logo is reflective.

506
01:03:36,110 --> 01:03:36,710
Like...

507
01:03:36,710 --> 01:03:38,990
I didn't realize the...

508
01:03:39,510 --> 01:03:43,650
I didn't realize that the Nike logo was, like, reflective.

509
01:03:44,010 --> 01:03:45,930
Because, you know, it's the logo.

510
01:03:46,770 --> 01:03:48,670
So, I was like, oops.

511
01:03:52,830 --> 01:03:53,430
So...

512
01:03:54,210 --> 01:03:55,850
So, I was like, oops.

513
01:03:55,850 --> 01:03:58,730
And then they were like, oh, don't worry, we'll just tape up the logo.

514
01:03:59,330 --> 01:04:00,950
And we'll just tape it up.

515
01:04:01,010 --> 01:04:02,770
And I was like, I could've got free shoes.

516
01:04:05,390 --> 01:04:10,350
I'm just thinking, like, oh my gosh, I should've also been, like, free stuff.

517
01:04:10,470 --> 01:04:11,030
Let's go.

518
01:04:15,930 --> 01:04:16,910
I'm so stupid.

519
01:04:16,970 --> 01:04:17,650
Why did I...

520
01:04:17,650 --> 01:04:20,990
Why did I, for one time in my life, decide to have a conscience?

521
01:04:21,390 --> 01:04:22,570
I should've been greedy.

522
01:04:28,810 --> 01:04:29,670
See, guys?

523
01:04:30,430 --> 01:04:32,890
Doing a good thing is not the right thing.

524
01:04:35,690 --> 01:04:37,510
That's the lesson I took out of it.

525
01:04:37,850 --> 01:04:39,590
No more doing good things now.

526
01:04:43,970 --> 01:04:44,370
No!

527
01:04:46,630 --> 01:04:49,210
This is what happens when I try to be a nice person.

528
01:04:54,260 --> 01:04:55,300
Greed is the best?

529
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:56,160
Okay, to be fair.

530
01:04:57,520 --> 01:04:59,300
They had, like...

531
01:04:59,300 --> 01:05:04,120
I was a little greedy, though.

532
01:05:04,460 --> 01:05:08,980
Because, like, I saw that they were like, oh, we have some water for you guys.

533
01:05:09,080 --> 01:05:09,840
And coffee.

534
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:11,560
But it was, like, from a coffee machine.

535
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:14,160
So there's, like, those, like, pot...

536
01:05:14,780 --> 01:05:16,340
Like, the coffee...

537
01:05:16,340 --> 01:05:19,640
Like, the coffee, like, pots that they use.

538
01:05:19,700 --> 01:05:21,560
Was, like, you know, they're, like, McDonald's.

539
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:25,060
The McDonald's ice mocha shit or whatever.

540
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:27,360
And then, like...

541
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:30,260
And then, I was like, oh, I don't want to drink, like, free...

542
01:05:31,340 --> 01:05:32,500
Like, what's it called?

543
01:05:33,900 --> 01:05:36,200
Like, those, like, coffee maker stuff.

544
01:05:36,660 --> 01:05:38,240
And then, I was just like...

545
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:38,860
Yeah, the pots.

546
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:40,880
I was like, oh, I don't really want to drink pots.

547
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,700
And then, they have, like, water.

548
01:05:42,860 --> 01:05:46,120
And then, I see, like, in the fridge, there was, like, boba tea.

549
01:05:46,740 --> 01:05:47,260
I was like...

550
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:49,180
I was just like, boba...

551
01:05:49,640 --> 01:05:52,140
I was like, wait, I want that.

552
01:05:54,140 --> 01:05:56,280
You know, they didn't offer it.

553
01:05:56,500 --> 01:05:59,820
But I saw in the fridge, they put their, like, boba orders there.

554
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:01,800
I was like, wait a minute.

555
01:06:02,460 --> 01:06:03,340
I want boba.

556
01:06:06,980 --> 01:06:08,340
So, I was like...

557
01:06:08,340 --> 01:06:09,760
I was just like...

558
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:10,560
Can I have...

559
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:11,140
Can we...

560
01:06:11,140 --> 01:06:13,320
Can I get some fresh boba?

561
01:06:14,540 --> 01:06:18,640
And they're like, oh, yeah, there's a boba tea store nearby.

562
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:19,600
There's...

563
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:22,840
Yeah, we can order them for you.

564
01:06:22,940 --> 01:06:23,640
And I'm like...

565
01:06:27,860 --> 01:06:29,380
For free.

566
01:06:32,860 --> 01:06:43,020
So, I managed to get Min and I free boba tea while we were practicing.

567
01:06:45,180 --> 01:06:47,000
Anyway, so I was like...

568
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,300
Thank God.

569
01:06:53,900 --> 01:06:56,240
So, we got that.

570
01:06:57,720 --> 01:06:59,820
And it was so tiring.

571
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:06,400
By the way, seeing Mint dance IRL is fucking crazy.

572
01:07:06,580 --> 01:07:08,640
Like, she's such a good dancer.

573
01:07:09,220 --> 01:07:11,080
Obviously, I can't spoil the set list.

574
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:13,320
But she's like...

575
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:15,220
She's a really good dancer.

576
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,200
And then there's me.

577
01:07:18,940 --> 01:07:20,420
And I was like...

578
01:07:20,820 --> 01:07:23,420
We're doing the duo dance.

579
01:07:23,580 --> 01:07:24,140
I was like...

580
01:07:24,680 --> 01:07:26,440
I was just like, bro...

581
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,300
I feel...

582
01:07:28,300 --> 01:07:32,140
I was like, oh my God, you can tell who's the dancer when we were dancing.

583
01:07:36,570 --> 01:07:37,090
Yeah.

584
01:07:37,610 --> 01:07:40,410
Yeah, she's so good.

585
01:07:40,490 --> 01:07:43,150
Oh my God, it's crazy.

586
01:07:43,390 --> 01:07:45,090
And then there was me.

587
01:07:45,390 --> 01:07:46,810
And I'm like...

588
01:07:49,830 --> 01:07:51,650
Like, I had to do like...

589
01:07:52,050 --> 01:07:53,470
Like, during my solos...

590
01:07:54,110 --> 01:07:54,990
I had to...

591
01:07:54,990 --> 01:07:56,470
Like, practicing for my solos...

592
01:07:57,170 --> 01:07:59,810
I had to do like...

593
01:07:59,810 --> 01:08:02,090
I had to do so many practices.

594
01:08:02,850 --> 01:08:05,950
But like, for Mint, she was like...

595
01:08:05,950 --> 01:08:06,650
She's like...

596
01:08:08,150 --> 01:08:09,730
Like, one or two times.

597
01:08:09,850 --> 01:08:11,450
And then she's like, I'm good with practice.

598
01:08:11,730 --> 01:08:13,270
And I'm like, what do you mean you're good?

599
01:08:14,310 --> 01:08:15,470
Like, for her solos.

600
01:08:16,390 --> 01:08:17,690
Like, I was like...

601
01:08:17,690 --> 01:08:20,290
What do you mean you're okay?

602
01:08:20,590 --> 01:08:21,690
I was like...

603
01:08:26,350 --> 01:08:27,890
And then I was like, I need more.

604
01:08:28,030 --> 01:08:28,910
Can I get like...

605
01:08:28,910 --> 01:08:31,690
Can I do it like five to six more times?

606
01:08:31,710 --> 01:08:32,550
And they're like, yeah, you can.

607
01:08:32,590 --> 01:08:35,130
You can practice it five, six more times.

608
01:08:35,230 --> 01:08:35,690
And I'm like...

609
01:08:40,690 --> 01:08:42,030
And she's like...

610
01:08:42,590 --> 01:08:43,230
I'm done.

611
01:08:47,790 --> 01:08:49,490
And like, my moves are already...

612
01:08:51,530 --> 01:08:52,250
What are you doing?

613
01:08:52,550 --> 01:08:53,130
She was like...

614
01:08:53,130 --> 01:08:55,710
She was like fucking jumping and bouncing.

615
01:08:56,190 --> 01:08:57,730
And I was just like...

616
01:08:59,350 --> 01:09:01,830
My dance lessons did not prepare me for this.

617
01:09:02,090 --> 01:09:10,910
I was like trying to remember my moves and everything.

618
01:09:11,250 --> 01:09:12,050
And then like...

619
01:09:12,050 --> 01:09:13,210
Like, oh my god.

620
01:09:14,690 --> 01:09:15,190
Anyway.

621
01:09:15,530 --> 01:09:16,310
Anyway, yeah.

622
01:09:16,370 --> 01:09:17,110
So that was...

623
01:09:17,110 --> 01:09:19,290
That was like what dance practice was like.

624
01:09:19,290 --> 01:09:20,070
Oh!

625
01:09:20,290 --> 01:09:21,050
Oh, the...

626
01:09:21,050 --> 01:09:21,690
It was so...

627
01:09:21,690 --> 01:09:22,670
Okay, the organizers.

628
01:09:23,070 --> 01:09:24,090
It was so sweet.

629
01:09:24,230 --> 01:09:25,390
Wait, let me show you guys.

630
01:09:26,150 --> 01:09:27,830
They actually gave me something.

631
01:09:28,710 --> 01:09:29,950
When I got there.

632
01:09:30,730 --> 01:09:31,610
It's so...

633
01:09:31,610 --> 01:09:32,670
It's so stupid.

634
01:09:35,290 --> 01:09:37,850
I was happy, but also I was like...

635
01:09:37,850 --> 01:09:40,610
Oh my god, I can't believe it.

636
01:09:43,150 --> 01:09:43,630
So...

637
01:09:43,630 --> 01:09:45,250
Okay, I need to make sure it's not...

638
01:09:45,250 --> 01:09:45,990
Okay, I need to...

639
01:09:45,990 --> 01:09:47,290
Okay, so...

640
01:09:47,290 --> 01:09:48,110
I'm gonna...

641
01:09:48,110 --> 01:09:50,250
Let me double check the picture real fast.

642
01:09:51,890 --> 01:09:53,010
For any...

643
01:09:53,010 --> 01:09:54,010
Alright, there we go.

644
01:09:54,070 --> 01:09:55,290
Okay, so...

645
01:09:56,890 --> 01:09:57,450
So...

646
01:09:59,330 --> 01:10:02,410
This is what the organizers gave me.

647
01:10:02,510 --> 01:10:07,290
They gave me a custom made Funko Pop.

648
01:10:07,510 --> 01:10:08,570
Because they were like...

649
01:10:08,570 --> 01:10:11,210
We heard that you've always wanted a Funko Pop.

650
01:10:11,310 --> 01:10:15,330
So we got you a custom made Funko Pop.

651
01:10:15,650 --> 01:10:16,610
And then...

652
01:10:16,610 --> 01:10:18,010
And then they got me...

653
01:10:18,010 --> 01:10:20,490
They got me a custom Oreo.

654
01:10:21,650 --> 01:10:23,090
Mint got this one too.

655
01:10:23,190 --> 01:10:23,950
The Oreo thing.

656
01:10:24,310 --> 01:10:26,150
She has one with the wisp.

657
01:10:26,470 --> 01:10:28,330
I have one of Croquis.

658
01:10:29,390 --> 01:10:30,730
I didn't try it.

659
01:10:31,150 --> 01:10:32,830
I didn't want to eat it.

660
01:10:32,890 --> 01:10:34,410
Because it's so cute.

661
01:10:35,690 --> 01:10:37,390
But they gave me these.

662
01:10:37,470 --> 01:10:38,910
And it was so sweet of them.

663
01:10:39,010 --> 01:10:39,650
The organizers.

664
01:10:41,450 --> 01:10:44,530
They gave Mint and I both the Oreos.

665
01:10:44,590 --> 01:10:46,250
And then they gave me the Funko Pop.

666
01:10:46,250 --> 01:10:46,770
Because they were like...

667
01:10:46,770 --> 01:10:49,330
We know you've always wanted a Funko Pop of yourself.

668
01:10:49,590 --> 01:10:50,890
That's your dream collab.

669
01:10:51,250 --> 01:10:51,550
And I was like...

670
01:10:51,550 --> 01:10:51,990
It is.

671
01:10:52,070 --> 01:10:53,590
That literally is my dream collab.

672
01:10:57,770 --> 01:10:59,510
It's so funny.

673
01:10:59,650 --> 01:11:01,590
I love it so much.

674
01:11:04,030 --> 01:11:04,830
But yeah.

675
01:11:05,070 --> 01:11:06,370
Speaking of Funko Pop.

676
01:11:06,610 --> 01:11:10,770
I saw my Nendoroid two days ago.

677
01:11:10,910 --> 01:11:13,610
The colored version of the Nendoroid.

678
01:11:13,610 --> 01:11:17,010
And all I can say is that...

679
01:11:17,470 --> 01:11:20,690
You might be able to pre-order it...

680
01:11:20,690 --> 01:11:23,130
Very, very soon.

681
01:11:27,270 --> 01:11:29,810
You might be able to pre-order it...

682
01:11:30,870 --> 01:11:33,710
Very, very, very soon.

683
01:11:33,870 --> 01:11:34,870
That's all I'll say.

684
01:11:35,090 --> 01:11:36,150
That's all I'll say.

685
01:11:39,670 --> 01:11:40,810
How soon?

686
01:11:41,350 --> 01:11:42,590
Before the year is over.

687
01:11:47,850 --> 01:11:48,470
So yeah.

688
01:11:48,570 --> 01:11:52,250
Make sure you have the funds for pre-ordering.

689
01:11:53,230 --> 01:11:54,770
But I'm so excited.

690
01:11:54,910 --> 01:11:55,870
I'm so, so excited.

691
01:11:56,050 --> 01:11:57,030
I showed Mint it.

692
01:11:57,110 --> 01:11:57,910
Because I was sent...

693
01:11:57,910 --> 01:11:58,390
I was like...

694
01:11:58,390 --> 01:11:59,350
When I was in the car.

695
01:12:00,090 --> 01:12:01,790
Heading to the studio.

696
01:12:06,830 --> 01:12:07,710
She like...

697
01:12:07,710 --> 01:12:09,570
I was sent the pictures.

698
01:12:10,110 --> 01:12:11,510
And then I showed Mint the...

699
01:12:12,210 --> 01:12:13,290
I showed it to Mint.

700
01:12:13,370 --> 01:12:14,830
And she thought it was really cute.

701
01:12:14,830 --> 01:12:17,570
So I'm super happy that it looked really, really good.

702
01:12:19,450 --> 01:12:20,490
Yeah, but yeah.

703
01:12:20,530 --> 01:12:21,470
I'm super excited.

704
01:12:21,690 --> 01:12:22,510
I'm really excited.

705
01:12:22,670 --> 01:12:26,650
I really hope that this provides more opportunities in the future.

706
01:12:26,910 --> 01:12:28,930
For the concert.

707
01:12:29,190 --> 01:12:31,310
So we can have streaming tickets next time.

708
01:12:31,390 --> 01:12:32,230
Because I know like...

709
01:12:32,230 --> 01:12:32,510
I know.

710
01:12:32,570 --> 01:12:35,010
I'm sorry we couldn't get streaming tickets this year.

711
01:12:35,650 --> 01:12:37,010
But maybe in the future.

712
01:12:37,210 --> 01:12:38,130
If we do this again.

713
01:12:38,310 --> 01:12:38,570
Thank you.

714
01:12:38,590 --> 01:12:39,550
Thank you for the super chat.

715
01:12:39,610 --> 01:12:39,870
Thank you.

716
01:12:39,910 --> 01:12:40,690
Thank you.

717
01:12:42,330 --> 01:12:42,770
But...

718
01:12:42,770 --> 01:12:46,110
We both are going to be uploading videos and stuff.

719
01:12:47,210 --> 01:12:47,650
So...

720
01:12:49,630 --> 01:12:51,370
Recordings and photos are allowed.

721
01:12:51,930 --> 01:12:52,910
For the concert.

722
01:12:53,210 --> 01:12:53,650
And like...

723
01:12:53,650 --> 01:12:57,410
Mint and I are both going to upload our favorite performances on our channel.

724
01:12:57,590 --> 01:12:58,010
So like...

725
01:12:58,010 --> 01:12:58,930
For those who can't make it.

726
01:12:58,970 --> 01:13:00,730
We'll still have like parts of the concert.

727
01:13:00,910 --> 01:13:01,830
You guys can watch.

728
01:13:02,190 --> 01:13:03,450
So I'm super excited.

729
01:13:03,710 --> 01:13:04,590
I'm super excited.

730
01:13:05,050 --> 01:13:06,930
Let me check my little thing that I wrote.

731
01:13:07,030 --> 01:13:08,150
About like...

732
01:13:08,150 --> 01:13:09,910
Stuff I want to talk to you guys about.

733
01:13:10,650 --> 01:13:11,490
Let me...

734
01:13:11,490 --> 01:13:11,970
Oh yeah.

735
01:13:12,130 --> 01:13:12,930
Dad's not here.

736
01:13:13,390 --> 01:13:15,130
He's still at the sitter.

737
01:13:15,730 --> 01:13:18,170
Doki Amber Doge is still not here.

738
01:13:18,290 --> 01:13:19,990
Because he's still at the sitter.

739
01:13:20,630 --> 01:13:21,490
Because like...

740
01:13:21,490 --> 01:13:21,830
I was...

741
01:13:21,830 --> 01:13:22,310
I came back.

742
01:13:22,390 --> 01:13:22,510
You know.

743
01:13:22,630 --> 01:13:23,510
I felt really sick.

744
01:13:23,610 --> 01:13:25,230
So I was supposed to pick him up today.

745
01:13:25,590 --> 01:13:27,390
But I felt really sick.

746
01:13:27,530 --> 01:13:27,950
So...

747
01:13:27,950 --> 01:13:28,970
Not like really...

748
01:13:28,970 --> 01:13:30,330
Like I didn't feel okay.

749
01:13:30,770 --> 01:13:31,290
So...

750
01:13:31,290 --> 01:13:32,670
So I was just like...

751
01:13:32,670 --> 01:13:33,010
Okay.

752
01:13:33,230 --> 01:13:33,710
Can you...

753
01:13:33,710 --> 01:13:34,870
Can you like...

754
01:13:34,870 --> 01:13:35,510
Oh wait.

755
01:13:35,870 --> 01:13:36,590
That's the photo.

756
01:13:36,750 --> 01:13:37,130
Let me...

757
01:13:37,130 --> 01:13:38,250
I need to fix the transform.

758
01:13:39,590 --> 01:13:40,450
So like...

759
01:13:40,450 --> 01:13:41,470
I was like...

760
01:13:41,470 --> 01:13:43,410
Can you take care of him for one more day?

761
01:13:43,550 --> 01:13:44,170
And she was like...

762
01:13:44,170 --> 01:13:44,310
Yeah.

763
01:13:44,470 --> 01:13:44,670
Yeah.

764
01:13:44,730 --> 01:13:45,150
I can.

765
01:13:45,650 --> 01:13:46,610
But like...

766
01:13:46,610 --> 01:13:48,530
They sent me daily photos.

767
01:13:49,010 --> 01:13:50,170
And I saw this.

768
01:13:50,290 --> 01:13:51,050
And I was like...

769
01:13:51,050 --> 01:13:52,970
He's not going to want to come back.

770
01:13:53,210 --> 01:13:53,430
Man.

771
01:13:53,570 --> 01:13:54,050
He's...

772
01:13:54,570 --> 01:13:55,050
He's...

773
01:13:55,050 --> 01:13:55,810
So

774
01:14:00,540 --> 01:14:01,480
I was like...

775
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:03,200
I don't think he wants to come back.

776
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:06,880
He's like...

777
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:08,740
100% okay.

778
01:14:10,160 --> 01:14:13,400
He's living the dream life.

779
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:15,160
It's dead.

780
01:14:18,460 --> 01:14:20,940
He's just like...

781
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:26,780
He doesn't want to come back.

782
01:14:27,140 --> 01:14:29,980
I don't think he wants to come back.

783
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:30,740
Guys.

784
01:14:30,740 --> 01:14:31,380
He looks...

785
01:14:31,380 --> 01:14:33,920
He looks way to comfy.

786
01:14:34,100 --> 01:14:35,680
Like this is the original...

787
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:36,480
Like what?

788
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:39,100
We've lost him.

789
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:41,040
I saw this.

790
01:14:41,140 --> 01:14:41,820
I was like...

791
01:14:41,820 --> 01:14:42,380
Oh man.

792
01:14:42,900 --> 01:14:43,460
Okay.

793
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:44,800
Okay.

794
01:14:49,680 --> 01:14:52,860
It's like, tomorrow I'll have to go back.

795
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:03,140
Oh my god, the cozy is so comfy.

796
01:15:07,560 --> 01:15:13,480
So yeah, like, I saw that and I was like, I don't even know if he wants to come back, man.

797
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:15,120
I don't even know if he wants to come back.

798
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:15,900
He wants to!

799
01:15:20,260 --> 01:15:27,620
Oh yeah, that's like, that's a dad update.

800
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:32,060
That's a dad update for today.

801
01:15:34,760 --> 01:15:35,920
Let's see.

802
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:36,760
Oh yeah!

803
01:15:38,460 --> 01:15:48,140
By the way, I forgot how restrictive the TSA is for Americans when you go to America.

804
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:52,580
Cause like, when I... Okay, so like, I was so annoyed.

805
01:15:53,080 --> 01:15:55,780
Because, um, I was really annoyed.

806
01:15:56,060 --> 01:16:00,640
Because like, I haven't flown to America in a long, long, long time.

807
01:16:01,100 --> 01:16:05,100
Like, but I flew to like, everywhere else in the world, by the way.

808
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:08,080
I've gone to so many other places in the world.

809
01:16:08,420 --> 01:16:13,700
But in America, like, I forgot how restrictive it is.

810
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:15,720
Why did I say that?

811
01:16:15,860 --> 01:16:18,860
Well, it's because like, I'm not used...

812
01:16:18,860 --> 01:16:22,160
I'm not used to like, taking...

813
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:26,400
Okay, so like, basically I would put my laptop in my checked baggage.

814
01:16:26,820 --> 01:16:29,220
Because I was like, I don't need to use my laptop on the plane.

815
01:16:29,380 --> 01:16:30,840
So I put it in my checked in baggage.

816
01:16:32,180 --> 01:16:36,260
And... And like, any other place in the world, it has worked.

817
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:38,760
Putting my laptop in a checked baggage.

818
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:43,540
Cause like, I'm like, I don't need to put... I don't want to put it in my...

819
01:16:43,540 --> 01:16:44,840
Cause like, I'm not going to be using it.

820
01:16:44,980 --> 01:16:46,600
So like, that's my mindset.

821
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:48,680
That's my mindset.

822
01:16:51,580 --> 01:16:52,900
I've never... And then...

823
01:16:52,900 --> 01:16:55,040
I was like, uh...

824
01:16:56,060 --> 01:16:59,780
I was like, I was like, oh, um...

825
01:16:59,780 --> 01:17:02,480
Yeah, like, they're like, no, you have to...

826
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:04,040
You have to take it out.

827
01:17:04,580 --> 01:17:07,560
And I was like, cause they're like, are there any laptops in there?

828
01:17:07,640 --> 01:17:09,980
And I was like, yeah, I've been checking it in.

829
01:17:10,340 --> 01:17:12,340
And they're like, you have to take it out.

830
01:17:12,340 --> 01:17:13,280
And I was like, what?

831
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:15,560
I'm so confused.

832
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:21,240
I'm so... I'm so confused.

833
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:23,500
Cause like, I didn't know that.

834
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:25,240
I didn't know that.

835
01:17:25,540 --> 01:17:27,180
Cause like, I've never had...

836
01:17:27,180 --> 01:17:28,880
Like, we were like, the battery's going to explode.

837
01:17:29,060 --> 01:17:29,440
It didn't pass.

838
01:17:29,820 --> 01:17:32,800
But, I've done that for like...

839
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:34,700
Since I've... Since I've got a laptop.

840
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:36,920
I've always put it in my checked baggage.

841
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:42,400
I've done...

842
01:17:44,500 --> 01:17:46,580
So, I was so confused.

843
01:17:50,860 --> 01:17:51,260
So...

844
01:17:52,540 --> 01:17:54,300
So, yeah, they're like...

845
01:17:54,300 --> 01:17:55,000
Cause I was like, okay.

846
01:17:55,680 --> 01:17:58,100
And I had to like, you know, I had to do the shame.

847
01:17:58,260 --> 01:18:02,520
You know, the opening up your luggage shame in front of the desk.

848
01:18:02,580 --> 01:18:03,980
So, I had to do that.

849
01:18:04,060 --> 01:18:05,440
I was just like...

850
01:18:06,680 --> 01:18:09,960
Like, opening up my luggage in front of everybody.

851
01:18:10,140 --> 01:18:12,300
So, I could get my laptop out.

852
01:18:12,580 --> 01:18:14,180
And I was like...

853
01:18:17,080 --> 01:18:20,800
No, it's not true.

854
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:22,760
I put my checked...

855
01:18:22,760 --> 01:18:26,080
I put my laptop in checked baggages in international...

856
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:29,260
Like, everywhere else in the world but America.

857
01:18:29,540 --> 01:18:31,980
I've done... I've done that since I've had a laptop.

858
01:18:31,980 --> 01:18:35,540
Cause I never had to use a laptop on the plane.

859
01:18:36,660 --> 01:18:37,620
And so...

860
01:18:37,620 --> 01:18:39,200
So, like, I did that.

861
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:39,860
And then...

862
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:45,200
I forgot that you guys have to take off your shoes.

863
01:18:45,780 --> 01:18:46,280
And...

864
01:18:46,890 --> 01:18:49,160
And like, you have to put everything.

865
01:18:49,340 --> 01:18:50,580
Cause sometimes you don't.

866
01:18:50,940 --> 01:18:54,300
Sometimes, like, taking off your shoes is like a choice.

867
01:18:55,140 --> 01:18:55,640
Like...

868
01:18:56,180 --> 01:18:57,640
It's like a choice.

869
01:18:58,040 --> 01:19:00,500
So, like, I forgot you have to put everything.

870
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:04,000
Yeah.

871
01:19:05,100 --> 01:19:05,580
Like...

872
01:19:05,580 --> 01:19:08,200
So, like, to America, you have to.

873
01:19:08,340 --> 01:19:09,600
But, like, something...

874
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:11,420
In international flights, it's like a choice.

875
01:19:11,540 --> 01:19:12,620
It's not like a...

876
01:19:12,620 --> 01:19:15,080
It's not like a thing you have to do.

877
01:19:15,580 --> 01:19:18,380
The funniest thing about it is that...

878
01:19:18,380 --> 01:19:19,980
The TSA in Canada...

879
01:19:20,580 --> 01:19:21,820
Like, in Canada...

880
01:19:21,820 --> 01:19:22,360
The...

881
01:19:22,360 --> 01:19:25,880
The, like, baggage stuff...

882
01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:27,580
Like, to check it, it's like separate.

883
01:19:27,740 --> 01:19:31,120
I think the TSA is responsible for...

884
01:19:31,120 --> 01:19:33,460
The flights to America side.

885
01:19:33,620 --> 01:19:36,560
Cause, like, you know, when I fly international flights...

886
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:37,120
Or, like...

887
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:39,180
It's different from...

888
01:19:39,180 --> 01:19:41,220
It's different from on the...

889
01:19:41,220 --> 01:19:45,720
Cause it's separated between, like, American flights and international flights.

890
01:19:46,100 --> 01:19:46,700
So...

891
01:19:46,700 --> 01:19:49,360
Like, it's international as in America is not international flight.

892
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:50,780
But, it's like...

893
01:19:50,780 --> 01:19:53,350
The America side in the Canadian airport...

894
01:19:54,100 --> 01:19:55,280
It's it's own thing.

895
01:19:55,720 --> 01:19:57,660
Which I thought was, like, crazy.

896
01:19:57,800 --> 01:19:58,300
Because...

897
01:19:58,300 --> 01:20:02,080
Not crazy, but, like, it's actually pretty weird for me.

898
01:20:02,160 --> 01:20:03,720
Cause I was like...

899
01:20:04,460 --> 01:20:05,340
It's like...

900
01:20:05,340 --> 01:20:07,720
If you're going to anywhere but America...

901
01:20:07,720 --> 01:20:09,120
You get to go to this side.

902
01:20:09,340 --> 01:20:13,700
But, if you go to America, you have to go to this specific TSA check.

903
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:16,880
So, and it's like more strict, but it's in the same airport.

904
01:20:19,180 --> 01:20:19,620
Like...

905
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:25,960
It's like in the same airport, but it's much more stricter than the everywhere else.

906
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:31,080
And...

907
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:32,200
And then, like...

908
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:34,200
I got called over...

909
01:20:34,200 --> 01:20:37,940
Like, before I could get to, like, the scanning part...

910
01:20:37,940 --> 01:20:38,860
Like, I...

911
01:20:38,860 --> 01:20:40,300
Before I got over...

912
01:20:41,560 --> 01:20:42,080
To...

913
01:20:42,080 --> 01:20:44,680
The scanning part of my luggage.

914
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:45,840
Like, my carry-on.

915
01:20:46,060 --> 01:20:48,080
They pulled me aside...

916
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:48,700
To, like...

917
01:20:48,700 --> 01:20:51,520
They pulled me aside...

918
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:53,300
Because my bag was particularly...

919
01:20:53,300 --> 01:20:55,340
My carry-on bag was particularly big.

920
01:20:55,340 --> 01:20:57,800
So, they did a separate inspection...

921
01:20:57,800 --> 01:20:58,900
Of my lap...

922
01:20:58,900 --> 01:21:00,340
And then, they're like, what's in your bag?

923
01:21:00,380 --> 01:21:01,000
And I was like, my laptop.

924
01:21:01,480 --> 01:21:02,580
Mostly, it's my laptop.

925
01:21:03,040 --> 01:21:03,700
And they're like...

926
01:21:03,700 --> 01:21:06,720
They, like, just took my laptop and, like, you know...

927
01:21:06,720 --> 01:21:08,700
Tested it if it's a bomb or something.

928
01:21:08,980 --> 01:21:10,360
Like, you know, the...

929
01:21:10,360 --> 01:21:11,880
Like, they did the wipe thing.

930
01:21:13,320 --> 01:21:13,720
And...

931
01:21:13,720 --> 01:21:14,460
So, they did that.

932
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:16,860
This is me, like, still in Canada, by the way.

933
01:21:16,900 --> 01:21:17,900
I'm still in Canada.

934
01:21:18,520 --> 01:21:20,360
Like, I haven't crossed the border yet.

935
01:21:22,940 --> 01:21:23,740
I haven't...

936
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:25,980
I haven't crossed the border yet.

937
01:21:26,120 --> 01:21:26,720
Like, they want...

938
01:21:26,720 --> 01:21:28,760
They test you before you go through the border.

939
01:21:29,180 --> 01:21:31,000
Because then it would be Canada's problem.

940
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:34,160
But, like, it's like Americans and Canadian border.

941
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:36,140
But they test you before you go, Pat.

942
01:21:36,220 --> 01:21:37,340
So, it's like...

943
01:21:37,340 --> 01:21:39,500
Anyway, then after I...

944
01:21:39,500 --> 01:21:40,320
You know, they did...

945
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:41,160
They're like, it's not a bomb.

946
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:43,920
So, then I went to the x-ray thing.

947
01:21:44,340 --> 01:21:46,780
And then, my bag got, like, marked again.

948
01:21:46,820 --> 01:21:47,820
Because it's a laptop.

949
01:21:48,380 --> 01:21:50,460
So, they retested my laptop.

950
01:21:50,460 --> 01:21:52,220
And I was like...

951
01:21:52,220 --> 01:21:54,040
You already tested my laptop?

952
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:56,060
Why do you have to do it again?

953
01:21:56,060 --> 01:21:58,060
What's the first lady fucking wrong?

954
01:21:58,480 --> 01:21:58,520
Like...

955
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,640
I'm just like...

956
01:22:01,640 --> 01:22:03,940
What's the first lady fucking wrong?

957
01:22:04,240 --> 01:22:05,980
Like, why do you have to do it again?

958
01:22:10,660 --> 01:22:11,200
So...

959
01:22:11,200 --> 01:22:16,480
Like, when they were, you know, fucking testing my laptop again...

960
01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:17,000
Um...

961
01:22:18,520 --> 01:22:19,320
They were...

962
01:22:19,320 --> 01:22:21,620
I was like, oh yeah, like...

963
01:22:21,620 --> 01:22:23,180
Because it's taking a while.

964
01:22:23,420 --> 01:22:25,040
So, I was like, oh yeah.

965
01:22:25,180 --> 01:22:28,100
Because they were, like, fucking inspecting my laptop and everything.

966
01:22:28,240 --> 01:22:29,500
Like, flipping it and stuff.

967
01:22:30,120 --> 01:22:31,600
And then I was like...

968
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:32,900
Oh, um...

969
01:22:32,900 --> 01:22:36,460
Like, the lady pulled me aside and already looked over the laptop.

970
01:22:36,680 --> 01:22:38,500
And then she was like, yeah, but that's random.

971
01:22:40,500 --> 01:22:42,020
That's a random search.

972
01:22:42,020 --> 01:22:45,340
I'm like, but you still have the same thing.

973
01:22:45,640 --> 01:22:47,500
You're doing the same thing.

974
01:22:47,580 --> 01:22:48,360
What do you mean?

975
01:22:57,210 --> 01:23:00,390
I won the gacha twice.

976
01:23:01,790 --> 01:23:03,110
That shouldn't matter.

977
01:23:03,290 --> 01:23:04,830
Like, it's already okay.

978
01:23:05,790 --> 01:23:07,690
It's already okay.

979
01:23:08,250 --> 01:23:09,710
You already tested it.

980
01:23:17,830 --> 01:23:18,290
Um...

981
01:23:18,750 --> 01:23:18,950
Um...

982
01:23:18,950 --> 01:23:20,830
But yeah, that was, um...

983
01:23:20,830 --> 01:23:24,850
That was, like, basically my adventures with the TSA in Canada.

984
01:23:25,610 --> 01:23:27,070
In Canada.

985
01:23:27,650 --> 01:23:27,970
In Canada.

986
01:23:29,950 --> 01:23:30,410
Um...

987
01:23:30,870 --> 01:23:31,510
Um...

988
01:23:31,630 --> 01:23:32,090
Um...

989
01:23:32,090 --> 01:23:32,230
Um...

990
01:23:32,230 --> 01:23:33,170
Um...

991
01:23:36,750 --> 01:23:37,670
Um...

992
01:23:39,630 --> 01:23:40,090
Um...

993
01:23:40,090 --> 01:23:40,730
Um...

994
01:23:40,730 --> 01:23:42,110
Thank you, thank you.

995
01:23:54,710 --> 01:23:55,990
But, like...

996
01:23:55,990 --> 01:23:57,930
I've never had to do that before.

997
01:23:58,290 --> 01:23:59,270
Like, in my...

998
01:23:59,270 --> 01:24:01,630
I've never had to do that before.

999
01:24:02,210 --> 01:24:03,530
They didn't care.

1000
01:24:04,250 --> 01:24:05,250
They didn't...

1001
01:24:05,250 --> 01:24:06,850
They're like...

1002
01:24:06,850 --> 01:24:08,190
The thing is...

1003
01:24:08,190 --> 01:24:10,510
The agent was like...

1004
01:24:10,510 --> 01:24:12,470
When I checked in my bag...

1005
01:24:12,470 --> 01:24:13,670
They were like...

1006
01:24:16,190 --> 01:24:16,630
Um...

1007
01:24:16,630 --> 01:24:18,130
They were like...

1008
01:24:18,130 --> 01:24:20,730
If we find out you have a laptop in there...

1009
01:24:20,730 --> 01:24:22,390
We will break open your luggage.

1010
01:24:22,930 --> 01:24:24,450
And I was like, whoa.

1011
01:24:25,850 --> 01:24:29,650
I was like, I'm pretty sure my luggage was never broken into before.

1012
01:24:29,790 --> 01:24:30,230
But okay.

1013
01:24:30,690 --> 01:24:32,310
But I don't want to play with America.

1014
01:24:33,010 --> 01:24:33,450
Like...

1015
01:24:37,910 --> 01:24:39,270
That's why...

1016
01:24:40,650 --> 01:24:42,370
I was like, whoa.

1017
01:24:42,690 --> 01:24:43,370
Okay.

1018
01:24:46,670 --> 01:24:48,650
Yeah, that's what they told me.

1019
01:24:50,750 --> 01:24:52,510
I was like...

1020
01:24:52,510 --> 01:24:54,730
So first class doesn't get...

1021
01:24:54,730 --> 01:24:56,570
Maybe it's because I was in business class.

1022
01:24:56,650 --> 01:24:57,930
So they're like...

1023
01:24:57,930 --> 01:25:00,810
They treated me better.

1024
01:25:01,750 --> 01:25:03,330
Wait, I think that's it.

1025
01:25:03,610 --> 01:25:04,830
I was never told.

1026
01:25:07,160 --> 01:25:10,020
Because I would always check in as business class.

1027
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:10,920
And like...

1028
01:25:10,920 --> 01:25:11,800
If you guys don't know...

1029
01:25:11,800 --> 01:25:13,940
People in business class get priority.

1030
01:25:14,780 --> 01:25:17,500
So they get priority...

1031
01:25:17,500 --> 01:25:19,360
Checks and everything.

1032
01:25:19,940 --> 01:25:20,420
So...

1033
01:25:25,480 --> 01:25:27,740
They don't have to line up.

1034
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:30,140
They get their own separate queue and stuff.

1035
01:25:34,440 --> 01:25:34,960
So...

1036
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:35,220
But yeah.

1037
01:25:35,460 --> 01:25:36,920
Anyway, so...

1038
01:25:36,920 --> 01:25:39,320
When I did a return flight...

1039
01:25:39,320 --> 01:25:42,140
When I did the return flight back to Canada...

1040
01:25:42,780 --> 01:25:44,460
I wanted to upgrade to first class.

1041
01:25:44,500 --> 01:25:45,900
Because they didn't have business class.

1042
01:25:46,180 --> 01:25:46,920
And like...

1043
01:25:46,920 --> 01:25:49,160
I was like...

1044
01:25:49,160 --> 01:25:51,740
In my head, I was like...

1045
01:25:51,740 --> 01:25:54,440
Well, if I want to pay for an upgrade...

1046
01:25:54,440 --> 01:25:56,540
I might as well pay for first class instead of economy plus.

1047
01:25:56,940 --> 01:25:57,620
And then...

1048
01:25:57,620 --> 01:25:59,360
On the website, it said there were seats left.

1049
01:25:59,940 --> 01:26:01,040
But I couldn't book any.

1050
01:26:03,020 --> 01:26:03,460
And...

1051
01:26:04,340 --> 01:26:04,780
Um...

1052
01:26:04,780 --> 01:26:06,100
So I was like...

1053
01:26:06,820 --> 01:26:10,020
To the check in, I was like...

1054
01:26:10,020 --> 01:26:11,720
No, it's because I had a hell...

1055
01:26:11,720 --> 01:26:13,900
My time was hell flying over in economy.

1056
01:26:14,080 --> 01:26:15,120
So I didn't want to do that again.

1057
01:26:15,220 --> 01:26:17,260
Because that was the day I realized that...

1058
01:26:17,260 --> 01:26:19,520
In economy, your seats are not slanted.

1059
01:26:19,700 --> 01:26:20,840
It's so fucked up.

1060
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:22,440
Like...

1061
01:26:22,440 --> 01:26:26,580
In economy plus, the seats are at least slanted.

1062
01:26:26,580 --> 01:26:28,760
But in economy, it's not.

1063
01:26:29,060 --> 01:26:30,100
I don't understand.

1064
01:26:30,420 --> 01:26:31,500
It's just straight up.

1065
01:26:32,720 --> 01:26:33,960
I was like...

1066
01:26:33,960 --> 01:26:35,280
That's so fucked up.

1067
01:26:35,700 --> 01:26:37,180
It's to fit more people.

1068
01:26:37,460 --> 01:26:40,000
At least, I just want the bare minimum.

1069
01:26:40,280 --> 01:26:41,960
I just want a little bit of slack.

1070
01:26:44,820 --> 01:26:45,380
I...

1071
01:26:46,720 --> 01:26:47,280
Anyway...

1072
01:26:48,240 --> 01:26:48,800
Um...

1073
01:26:50,820 --> 01:26:51,380
Um...

1074
01:26:51,380 --> 01:26:51,540
Um...

1075
01:26:51,540 --> 01:26:53,180
Anyway, so...

1076
01:26:53,880 --> 01:26:54,400
Uh...

1077
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:55,820
I was like...

1078
01:26:55,820 --> 01:26:57,720
So I...

1079
01:26:59,500 --> 01:27:01,180
I want to upgrade to first class.

1080
01:27:01,240 --> 01:27:02,020
Because I might as well.

1081
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:03,680
So I was like...

1082
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:04,500
I don't understand.

1083
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:08,240
On the website, it says that...

1084
01:27:09,040 --> 01:27:10,480
It says that...

1085
01:27:11,580 --> 01:27:13,840
There's seats left, but I can't upgrade it.

1086
01:27:13,900 --> 01:27:14,660
And they're like...

1087
01:27:14,660 --> 01:27:16,060
Oh yeah, like...

1088
01:27:16,060 --> 01:27:19,040
We always reserve seats for our gold members first.

1089
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:20,580
I'm like...

1090
01:27:20,580 --> 01:27:20,840
What?

1091
01:27:24,840 --> 01:27:25,920
So like...

1092
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:28,500
Our gold members, when they check in, we're gonna give them the free upgrade.

1093
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:30,540
I'm like...

1094
01:27:31,340 --> 01:27:31,880
Like...

1095
01:27:31,880 --> 01:27:33,500
I will pay.

1096
01:27:34,240 --> 01:27:35,800
I was just like...

1097
01:27:35,800 --> 01:27:37,640
I was just like...

1098
01:27:37,640 --> 01:27:37,980
What?

1099
01:27:40,420 --> 01:27:41,880
The guy was like...

1100
01:27:41,880 --> 01:27:42,860
I know, it's very reverse.

1101
01:27:43,980 --> 01:27:46,260
I was just like...

1102
01:27:46,260 --> 01:27:48,140
I'm like...

1103
01:27:48,140 --> 01:27:49,140
But...

1104
01:27:49,140 --> 01:27:51,020
I would pay right now.

1105
01:27:56,720 --> 01:27:58,020
I'm just like...

1106
01:27:58,020 --> 01:27:58,980
But they booked economy.

1107
01:27:59,700 --> 01:28:05,080
I'm just like...

1108
01:28:05,080 --> 01:28:06,980
They booked economy.

1109
01:28:07,460 --> 01:28:08,380
I'm like...

1110
01:28:08,380 --> 01:28:09,800
What do you mean?

1111
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:11,940
They can't be...

1112
01:28:11,940 --> 01:28:13,440
They're getting a free upgrade.

1113
01:28:13,640 --> 01:28:14,640
They booked economy.

1114
01:28:14,640 --> 01:28:19,100
They booked economy.

1115
01:28:22,370 --> 01:28:23,740
I'm just like...

1116
01:28:23,740 --> 01:28:26,620
It's not like they're gonna suddenly buy first class all of a sudden.

1117
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:29,080
If they booked economy now, they're always gonna book economy.

1118
01:28:31,540 --> 01:28:33,560
I was just like...

1119
01:28:33,560 --> 01:28:36,280
You have seats.

1120
01:28:36,720 --> 01:28:38,180
I didn't understand.

1121
01:28:38,620 --> 01:28:40,520
You have...

1122
01:28:40,520 --> 01:28:42,200
You have seats.

1123
01:28:42,200 --> 01:28:43,780
You have...

1124
01:28:43,780 --> 01:28:46,720
I was gonna give you free money.

1125
01:28:47,100 --> 01:28:49,420
I was gonna give you money for first class.

1126
01:28:50,860 --> 01:28:51,740
Anyway, so...

1127
01:28:51,740 --> 01:28:53,920
So then I just upgraded to economy plus.

1128
01:28:56,980 --> 01:29:01,920
Yeah, if they're a gold member, they should be able to pay for first class.

1129
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:03,740
But they spent it on economy.

1130
01:29:04,160 --> 01:29:05,800
I was willing to give money.

1131
01:29:06,480 --> 01:29:08,380
And then they're like...

1132
01:29:08,380 --> 01:29:08,760
Oh, yeah.

1133
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:12,700
So anyway, we're just gonna wait for these guys to see if they take the offer.

1134
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:13,920
But they usually do.

1135
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:15,500
Of course they usually do!

1136
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:16,260
It's free!

1137
01:29:16,540 --> 01:29:17,440
It's a free upgrade!

1138
01:29:19,500 --> 01:29:25,760
You can come back later when we're about to board if the first class seats are still available.

1139
01:29:26,360 --> 01:29:27,280
And I'm just like...

1140
01:29:27,280 --> 01:29:29,360
As if they're gonna fucking say no to first class.

1141
01:29:29,620 --> 01:29:30,660
It's a free upgrade.

1142
01:29:34,050 --> 01:29:35,070
I'm just like...

1143
01:29:35,070 --> 01:29:36,830
Of course they're gonna say yes!

1144
01:29:36,830 --> 01:29:39,330
It's literally a free upgrade!

1145
01:29:42,550 --> 01:29:45,010
They're gonna fucking say no!

1146
01:29:45,750 --> 01:29:46,850
But I did try.

1147
01:29:46,950 --> 01:29:47,450
I was desperate.

1148
01:29:47,910 --> 01:29:49,890
I did try.

1149
01:29:50,070 --> 01:29:53,390
Literally like 10 minutes before boarding, I went up to the desk.

1150
01:29:53,550 --> 01:29:55,030
And it was the same guy, by the way.

1151
01:29:55,070 --> 01:29:56,310
The guy who did my check-in.

1152
01:29:56,610 --> 01:29:57,630
He was still there.

1153
01:29:57,750 --> 01:30:00,490
He was there to board my plane.

1154
01:30:00,750 --> 01:30:02,210
To do the boarding of the plane.

1155
01:30:02,730 --> 01:30:04,110
And I was like...

1156
01:30:04,110 --> 01:30:05,910
Hi, I just want to know if there's...

1157
01:30:05,910 --> 01:30:07,430
I didn't recognize him.

1158
01:30:07,470 --> 01:30:09,110
Because I already deleted him from my head.

1159
01:30:10,030 --> 01:30:11,050
Because I was like...

1160
01:30:11,050 --> 01:30:11,650
Useless!

1161
01:30:12,090 --> 01:30:12,450
Gone!

1162
01:30:12,610 --> 01:30:14,070
Don't remember what you look like!

1163
01:30:17,830 --> 01:30:18,770
Anyway, so I was like...

1164
01:30:19,990 --> 01:30:20,870
First class upgrade.

1165
01:30:21,090 --> 01:30:22,330
And it was the same guy.

1166
01:30:22,650 --> 01:30:24,170
You know how I realized it was the same guy?

1167
01:30:24,290 --> 01:30:24,710
He was like...

1168
01:30:24,710 --> 01:30:26,030
They took the free upgrades.

1169
01:30:26,210 --> 01:30:28,770
And I'm like...

1170
01:30:31,130 --> 01:30:32,170
They're like...

1171
01:30:32,170 --> 01:30:32,690
Sorry, ma'am.

1172
01:30:32,770 --> 01:30:34,210
They took the free upgrades.

1173
01:30:34,510 --> 01:30:40,250
And I'm like...

1174
01:30:48,430 --> 01:30:49,950
So I couldn't...

1175
01:30:49,950 --> 01:30:51,890
I flew back in Economy Plus.

1176
01:30:52,170 --> 01:30:54,330
And that was the flight...

1177
01:30:54,870 --> 01:30:57,370
Where I was the middle seat of Economy Plus.

1178
01:30:57,630 --> 01:30:59,150
And I had to sit next to this lady.

1179
01:30:59,150 --> 01:31:00,290
Who was new to flying.

1180
01:31:00,410 --> 01:31:02,590
Because she kept taking pictures of the sky.

1181
01:31:02,810 --> 01:31:04,590
I got more leg room.

1182
01:31:05,130 --> 01:31:07,110
But that fucking lady was...

1183
01:31:07,110 --> 01:31:08,610
Kept taking pictures of the sky.

1184
01:31:08,690 --> 01:31:09,510
In the open window.

1185
01:31:09,670 --> 01:31:10,650
And I was the middle seat.

1186
01:31:10,870 --> 01:31:12,710
I was the middle seat.

1187
01:31:12,770 --> 01:31:15,390
But at least I had more leg room.

1188
01:31:16,030 --> 01:31:16,750
At least.

1189
01:31:19,690 --> 01:31:21,550
Thank you for the super chat.

1190
01:31:21,670 --> 01:31:24,110
Leave that lady alone.

1191
01:31:25,290 --> 01:31:26,450
About the TSA.

1192
01:31:26,450 --> 01:31:27,190
Fun fact.

1193
01:31:27,410 --> 01:31:28,550
During last year's AX.

1194
01:31:28,610 --> 01:31:30,390
I had all my locks snipped.

1195
01:31:30,930 --> 01:31:31,650
Because TSA...

1196
01:31:31,650 --> 01:31:33,830
Holy fuck.

1197
01:31:34,130 --> 01:31:36,370
They can do this to us with no refund.

1198
01:31:36,670 --> 01:31:37,070
For...

1199
01:31:37,070 --> 01:31:39,310
Jesus Christ.

1200
01:31:40,170 --> 01:31:40,950
That's...

1201
01:31:42,090 --> 01:31:43,610
That's fucking crazy.

1202
01:31:44,350 --> 01:31:46,030
That's actually...

1203
01:31:46,030 --> 01:31:47,670
TSA has...

1204
01:31:47,670 --> 01:31:49,130
Too much power.

1205
01:31:50,810 --> 01:31:52,270
Oh my god.

1206
01:31:52,330 --> 01:31:53,410
That's insane.

1207
01:31:53,410 --> 01:31:55,750
Just because they felt like it.

1208
01:31:55,950 --> 01:31:57,270
Dude, that's crazy.

1209
01:32:01,870 --> 01:32:02,950
Yeah, so...

1210
01:32:02,950 --> 01:32:03,990
That was my flight.

1211
01:32:04,130 --> 01:32:05,250
That's the day I learned.

1212
01:32:05,410 --> 01:32:08,410
I don't think I'll ever do economy again.

1213
01:32:08,530 --> 01:32:11,410
Because I don't want to be treated like that again.

1214
01:32:13,130 --> 01:32:13,670
Sorry.

1215
01:32:16,130 --> 01:32:17,670
Now that I know...

1216
01:32:17,670 --> 01:32:19,130
What it's like more recently.

1217
01:32:19,630 --> 01:32:20,910
I don't want to go through...

1218
01:32:20,910 --> 01:32:24,030
I don't want to go through that again.

1219
01:32:24,310 --> 01:32:25,970
I don't think I can go back.

1220
01:32:34,740 --> 01:32:35,840
That's why I work...

1221
01:32:35,840 --> 01:32:37,720
It's time to work even harder.

1222
01:32:38,540 --> 01:32:39,540
It's time.

1223
01:32:39,700 --> 01:32:42,360
It's time to work even harder.

1224
01:32:42,520 --> 01:32:45,080
So I don't have to do that again.

1225
01:32:46,820 --> 01:32:47,500
Also...

1226
01:32:47,500 --> 01:32:49,180
You know what grinds my gears?

1227
01:32:49,960 --> 01:32:50,640
Anyway.

1228
01:32:50,640 --> 01:32:52,760
You know what grinds my gears, guys?

1229
01:32:54,900 --> 01:32:57,040
Iced tea is not iced tea in America.

1230
01:32:57,480 --> 01:32:58,280
Iced tea is like...

1231
01:32:58,280 --> 01:32:59,120
They're literal.

1232
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:01,500
Okay, so...

1233
01:33:02,780 --> 01:33:05,020
I was so confused.

1234
01:33:05,460 --> 01:33:06,840
Because like...

1235
01:33:06,840 --> 01:33:07,880
I ordered iced tea.

1236
01:33:08,260 --> 01:33:11,600
But the thing is, iced tea in the rest of the world...

1237
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:12,820
It's like...

1238
01:33:12,820 --> 01:33:13,520
Lemon tea.

1239
01:33:14,980 --> 01:33:17,000
That's what we mean...

1240
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:18,180
By iced tea.

1241
01:33:18,180 --> 01:33:20,360
If you order iced tea anywhere else...

1242
01:33:21,100 --> 01:33:22,140
It's like lemon tea.

1243
01:33:22,420 --> 01:33:25,300
But then when I order iced tea in America...

1244
01:33:25,300 --> 01:33:26,340
It's literally tea.

1245
01:33:27,920 --> 01:33:29,240
It's tea, but iced.

1246
01:33:33,500 --> 01:33:34,860
Yeah, it's...

1247
01:33:34,860 --> 01:33:35,960
It's...

1248
01:33:35,960 --> 01:33:37,440
It's so weird.

1249
01:33:37,620 --> 01:33:39,340
It's actually tea.

1250
01:33:39,680 --> 01:33:42,160
I keep thinking...

1251
01:33:42,160 --> 01:33:43,780
It's gonna be like...

1252
01:33:43,780 --> 01:33:45,780
It comes with a lemon, but...

1253
01:33:45,780 --> 01:33:47,740
And then I got four.

1254
01:33:48,080 --> 01:33:48,940
Because I was like...

1255
01:33:48,940 --> 01:33:51,780
That's the iced tea I knew, because it came with a lemon.

1256
01:33:52,420 --> 01:33:54,180
And then...

1257
01:33:54,180 --> 01:33:55,720
But then...

1258
01:33:55,720 --> 01:33:56,500
But...

1259
01:33:56,500 --> 01:33:58,660
But it didn't taste like lemon.

1260
01:34:03,640 --> 01:34:04,760
It's like...

1261
01:34:04,760 --> 01:34:06,320
It's actually tea.

1262
01:34:07,860 --> 01:34:09,580
I was so confused.

1263
01:34:09,900 --> 01:34:10,480
I was like...

1264
01:34:10,480 --> 01:34:11,860
What is this?

1265
01:34:15,780 --> 01:34:16,380
It is...

1266
01:34:16,380 --> 01:34:18,260
It's literally iced tea.

1267
01:34:18,820 --> 01:34:20,580
It's literally iced tea.

1268
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:24,760
That threw me off.

1269
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,040
I was just thinking...

1270
01:34:27,040 --> 01:34:29,500
I can't wait to get me some sweet tea.

1271
01:34:29,920 --> 01:34:31,140
Some sweet lemon tea.

1272
01:34:31,640 --> 01:34:32,980
And then it's just iced.

1273
01:34:33,380 --> 01:34:34,760
It's just tea with some ice in it.

1274
01:34:34,920 --> 01:34:36,340
I got so confused.

1275
01:34:36,480 --> 01:34:38,580
I drank it and I was like...

1276
01:34:38,580 --> 01:34:39,400
It's not even sweet.

1277
01:34:39,860 --> 01:34:43,320
I was like...

1278
01:34:43,320 --> 01:34:44,980
What the fuck is this bullshit?

1279
01:34:46,160 --> 01:34:49,300
If I wanted to be healthy, I would just drink water.

1280
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:59,880
If I wanted to be healthy, why the fuck would I order iced tea?

1281
01:35:00,340 --> 01:35:04,320
I would just drink regular water.

1282
01:35:04,860 --> 01:35:07,200
Like regular iced water.

1283
01:35:09,080 --> 01:35:11,360
I'm fucking saying sweet tea.

1284
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:13,780
I was looking at the menu and they were like...

1285
01:35:13,780 --> 01:35:15,520
Oh, we have iced tea in the menu.

1286
01:35:15,940 --> 01:35:16,560
And I was like...

1287
01:35:16,560 --> 01:35:17,860
Yay, iced tea.

1288
01:35:24,300 --> 01:35:25,420
Anyway, so...

1289
01:35:25,420 --> 01:35:26,340
That like...

1290
01:35:26,340 --> 01:35:27,820
That tilted me so hard.

1291
01:35:27,920 --> 01:35:30,760
Not hard, but that tilted me a little bit.

1292
01:35:31,480 --> 01:35:33,680
Because I was like...

1293
01:35:33,680 --> 01:35:35,200
I just wanted...

1294
01:35:35,200 --> 01:35:38,000
I wanted my iced tea.

1295
01:35:38,140 --> 01:35:39,780
But it's actually iced tea.

1296
01:35:42,820 --> 01:35:44,740
It's just tea, but cold.

1297
01:35:44,960 --> 01:35:47,320
Like what is this fucking bullshit?

1298
01:35:51,940 --> 01:35:53,510
The world is very confusing.

1299
01:35:55,100 --> 01:35:56,100
Also like...

1300
01:35:56,720 --> 01:35:57,220
Guys...

1301
01:35:57,220 --> 01:35:58,020
What is unusual?

1302
01:35:58,140 --> 01:35:59,260
Okay, I was like...

1303
01:35:59,820 --> 01:36:02,100
Talking to my friends about this today.

1304
01:36:02,260 --> 01:36:03,260
Because like...

1305
01:36:03,260 --> 01:36:05,800
I need to print out postcards for...

1306
01:36:05,800 --> 01:36:07,980
By the way, I've been signing postcards non-stop.

1307
01:36:07,980 --> 01:36:09,500
Now I'm signing my own postcards.

1308
01:36:09,720 --> 01:36:10,660
Like yesterday and today.

1309
01:36:11,080 --> 01:36:12,560
But the thing is...

1310
01:36:12,560 --> 01:36:14,800
I need to print new postcards for my other stuff.

1311
01:36:15,200 --> 01:36:16,980
So, I'm like thinking...

1312
01:36:16,980 --> 01:36:17,520
What is this?

1313
01:36:17,760 --> 01:36:19,960
I just found out about this.

1314
01:36:20,320 --> 01:36:21,900
Because I was like...

1315
01:36:21,900 --> 01:36:24,100
4x6 is American...

1316
01:36:24,100 --> 01:36:27,340
Did you guys know 4x6 is like American sizes?

1317
01:36:27,760 --> 01:36:29,260
It's like US size.

1318
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:31,740
The rest of the world does not use our paper sizes.

1319
01:36:32,400 --> 01:36:33,440
And I just found out.

1320
01:36:33,440 --> 01:36:37,240
I just found out.

1321
01:36:37,500 --> 01:36:37,780
I just found out about this.

1322
01:36:38,020 --> 01:36:39,280
Because I was like...

1323
01:36:39,280 --> 01:36:40,920
Because you know, they don't use inches.

1324
01:36:41,140 --> 01:36:41,800
And we do.

1325
01:36:42,120 --> 01:36:44,120
Because I was like being like...

1326
01:36:44,120 --> 01:36:46,320
Oh yeah, what do like companies...

1327
01:36:46,320 --> 01:36:48,100
Like Corpo VTubers do?

1328
01:36:48,460 --> 01:36:50,580
Size print for postcards.

1329
01:36:51,220 --> 01:36:52,980
And then...

1330
01:36:52,980 --> 01:36:55,420
My friend who does like...

1331
01:36:55,420 --> 01:36:56,880
Artist Alley stuff.

1332
01:36:57,240 --> 01:36:58,180
She was like...

1333
01:36:58,180 --> 01:37:01,800
Oh yeah, it's 4.1x5.8.

1334
01:37:01,800 --> 01:37:02,700
I was like...

1335
01:37:02,700 --> 01:37:05,060
That's such a weird size.

1336
01:37:06,140 --> 01:37:07,600
It's just like...

1337
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:12,320
Why the fuck is it 4.1x5.8?

1338
01:37:12,520 --> 01:37:13,460
I was like...

1339
01:37:13,460 --> 01:37:14,600
That's weird.

1340
01:37:14,880 --> 01:37:16,120
And then she was like...

1341
01:37:16,120 --> 01:37:17,260
No, we're weird.

1342
01:37:18,380 --> 01:37:19,940
We're literally the only...

1343
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:21,560
And it's the only...

1344
01:37:21,560 --> 01:37:23,560
Only content that uses...

1345
01:37:23,560 --> 01:37:25,080
It's own sizes.

1346
01:37:25,080 --> 01:37:25,440
Like...

1347
01:37:29,440 --> 01:37:31,580
We're the only ones that use...

1348
01:37:31,580 --> 01:37:31,880
Inches.

1349
01:37:32,260 --> 01:37:34,120
We're the weird ones.

1350
01:37:35,200 --> 01:37:37,300
And I was like...

1351
01:37:37,300 --> 01:37:38,360
I was like...

1352
01:37:38,360 --> 01:37:38,840
Wait, what?

1353
01:37:40,060 --> 01:37:41,980
They use ABC.

1354
01:37:42,440 --> 01:37:43,020
And I'm like...

1355
01:37:43,020 --> 01:37:44,600
What the fuck is ABC?

1356
01:37:45,460 --> 01:37:46,580
I was like...

1357
01:37:46,580 --> 01:37:49,720
What the fuck is ABC?

1358
01:37:50,540 --> 01:37:51,580
And they're like...

1359
01:37:51,580 --> 01:37:53,760
That's what the rest of the world uses.

1360
01:37:54,220 --> 01:37:56,960
We use US paper sizes.

1361
01:38:00,100 --> 01:38:01,660
Cause we're like...

1362
01:38:01,660 --> 01:38:03,940
Letter, legal, and tabloid.

1363
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,840
But you guys have A3, A4, A5.

1364
01:38:07,020 --> 01:38:08,020
And I'm like...

1365
01:38:08,020 --> 01:38:08,980
I'm like...

1366
01:38:08,980 --> 01:38:10,140
The fuck is...

1367
01:38:10,140 --> 01:38:17,160
The fuck is 4.1x5.8?

1368
01:38:17,420 --> 01:38:19,800
That's such a weird thing.

1369
01:38:19,800 --> 01:38:21,800
That's such a weird dimension.

1370
01:38:23,160 --> 01:38:23,700
Like...

1371
01:38:23,700 --> 01:38:25,180
Okay, so...

1372
01:38:25,730 --> 01:38:26,880
Yeah, so...

1373
01:38:26,880 --> 01:38:28,180
I found that out today.

1374
01:38:28,340 --> 01:38:29,320
Cause I was like...

1375
01:38:30,840 --> 01:38:32,200
Cause I was like...

1376
01:38:32,200 --> 01:38:33,860
4x16 is really small.

1377
01:38:34,140 --> 01:38:36,520
Cause I have my postcards.

1378
01:38:36,640 --> 01:38:38,460
I'm signing the current postcards right now.

1379
01:38:39,480 --> 01:38:40,880
And it's really small.

1380
01:38:40,960 --> 01:38:42,200
I thought it was really small.

1381
01:38:42,360 --> 01:38:42,840
Cause I was like...

1382
01:38:43,720 --> 01:38:45,440
4x16 is not that big.

1383
01:38:45,440 --> 01:38:46,940
It seems really thin.

1384
01:38:47,480 --> 01:38:48,340
And then...

1385
01:38:49,260 --> 01:38:51,960
I was asking my friends.

1386
01:38:52,040 --> 01:38:52,400
I was like...

1387
01:38:52,400 --> 01:38:55,120
Do you guys own any...

1388
01:38:55,120 --> 01:38:56,060
Company?

1389
01:38:57,140 --> 01:38:58,140
Vtuber merch?

1390
01:38:58,660 --> 01:39:00,440
What sizes are they normally?

1391
01:39:01,900 --> 01:39:03,920
Cause the ones I have...

1392
01:39:03,920 --> 01:39:05,540
I don't even remember if I packed them.

1393
01:39:06,140 --> 01:39:07,700
I don't know where it is.

1394
01:39:07,840 --> 01:39:08,960
So I couldn't check.

1395
01:39:09,500 --> 01:39:09,940
Physically.

1396
01:39:10,580 --> 01:39:11,680
So I was like...

1397
01:39:11,680 --> 01:39:13,720
Oh man, what are the sizes?

1398
01:39:13,840 --> 01:39:15,440
Cause I felt like it was a little bigger.

1399
01:39:15,720 --> 01:39:17,040
Cause I was looking at photos.

1400
01:39:17,180 --> 01:39:20,200
I was looking at Hololive birthday postcard merch.

1401
01:39:20,240 --> 01:39:21,620
Cause it doesn't say the dimensions.

1402
01:39:22,380 --> 01:39:24,140
And I was looking at my postcard.

1403
01:39:24,440 --> 01:39:26,640
And I was trying to compare it.

1404
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:28,540
I was putting it up on the screen.

1405
01:39:28,640 --> 01:39:29,560
And comparing it.

1406
01:39:29,900 --> 01:39:31,180
And I was like...

1407
01:39:31,180 --> 01:39:32,160
Yours look bigger.

1408
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:35,220
I was like...

1409
01:39:35,220 --> 01:39:36,760
Yours look a little bigger.

1410
01:39:36,960 --> 01:39:38,440
I was comparing it.

1411
01:39:38,440 --> 01:39:39,160
I was like...

1412
01:39:39,160 --> 01:39:40,800
Wait, it looks wider.

1413
01:39:40,940 --> 01:39:42,200
Cause it is wider!

1414
01:39:42,860 --> 01:39:45,860
Cause my friend was like...

1415
01:39:45,860 --> 01:39:48,920
Yeah, we use 4x6.

1416
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:50,480
They use 4.1.

1417
01:39:51,720 --> 01:39:53,200
There might be like...

1418
01:39:53,200 --> 01:39:54,600
5.8 and we're 6.

1419
01:39:54,780 --> 01:39:56,240
But theirs is wider.

1420
01:39:56,780 --> 01:39:57,620
So I was like...

1421
01:39:57,620 --> 01:39:58,720
They're 1 inch wider.

1422
01:39:59,140 --> 01:39:59,720
So I was like...

1423
01:39:59,720 --> 01:40:00,920
Don't fucking wonder.

1424
01:40:01,060 --> 01:40:02,100
I was like...

1425
01:40:02,100 --> 01:40:03,060
Oh my god!

1426
01:40:03,820 --> 01:40:05,000
I was like...

1427
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,760
My 4x6 is 4.1!

1428
01:40:08,680 --> 01:40:09,800
Cause I was like...

1429
01:40:09,800 --> 01:40:10,740
Wondering...

1430
01:40:10,740 --> 01:40:12,600
Why does mine look smaller?

1431
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:15,060
Like less wide.

1432
01:40:20,330 --> 01:40:22,470
0.1 makes a huge difference, guys.

1433
01:40:26,770 --> 01:40:29,070
Thank you for the superchat.

1434
01:40:29,150 --> 01:40:30,150
Thank you.

1435
01:40:30,350 --> 01:40:31,030
Hi Doki.

1436
01:40:31,030 --> 01:40:32,790
You and Mint are my kami-oshis.

1437
01:40:32,890 --> 01:40:34,870
So Phantom Thief concert made me confused.

1438
01:40:35,030 --> 01:40:37,150
I wanted a happy birthday from you and Mint.

1439
01:40:37,270 --> 01:40:40,170
But forgot my birthday was not the 18th of...

1440
01:40:40,170 --> 01:40:41,030
Next month.

1441
01:40:41,210 --> 01:40:43,930
By the way, you forgot your own birthday.

1442
01:40:44,550 --> 01:40:45,210
Oh my god.

1443
01:40:45,210 --> 01:40:45,510
Don't worry.

1444
01:40:45,590 --> 01:40:46,390
I'll sing you a happy birthday.

1445
01:40:46,790 --> 01:40:48,010
Happy birthday to you.

1446
01:40:48,170 --> 01:40:49,510
Happy birthday to you.

1447
01:40:49,670 --> 01:40:50,670
Happy birthday to you.

1448
01:40:52,310 --> 01:40:52,790
Yeah!

1449
01:40:53,690 --> 01:40:54,410
Happy birthday!

1450
01:40:55,250 --> 01:40:56,390
Thank you for the superchat, Cypher.

1451
01:40:56,450 --> 01:40:57,330
Thank you, thank you.

1452
01:40:57,330 --> 01:40:59,010
4.1 is the...

1453
01:40:59,010 --> 01:40:59,870
No, it's not!

1454
01:41:00,210 --> 01:41:01,870
It can be landscape.

1455
01:41:02,170 --> 01:41:04,310
It can be interchangeable, guys.

1456
01:41:04,610 --> 01:41:06,350
It can be landscape or portrait.

1457
01:41:06,530 --> 01:41:07,370
It doesn't matter.

1458
01:41:08,690 --> 01:41:10,490
You can rotate it.

1459
01:41:10,850 --> 01:41:12,510
That's what you can do.

1460
01:41:13,890 --> 01:41:14,650
So like...

1461
01:41:15,330 --> 01:41:17,330
Is it like...

1462
01:41:19,970 --> 01:41:22,350
FYI, Canada Post is going on strike.

1463
01:41:22,450 --> 01:41:24,290
Are you fucking kidding me?

1464
01:41:28,130 --> 01:41:29,150
Okay, guys.

1465
01:41:29,930 --> 01:41:34,830
My distributor messaged me and was telling me Canada Post is now on strike, guys.

1466
01:41:35,190 --> 01:41:36,110
I'm so sorry.

1467
01:41:36,630 --> 01:41:37,610
Wait, it's my life!

1468
01:41:38,110 --> 01:41:40,210
I didn't know!

1469
01:41:41,010 --> 01:41:41,430
Okay.

1470
01:41:41,770 --> 01:41:45,870
I've been getting emails about Canada Post but I wasn't reading it.

1471
01:41:46,850 --> 01:41:47,870
Oh, I should have read.

1472
01:41:48,090 --> 01:41:51,770
They're like negotiation updates from Canada Post.

1473
01:41:51,950 --> 01:41:53,190
Okay, there we go.

1474
01:41:53,190 --> 01:41:54,510
Alright, so anyway.

1475
01:41:54,670 --> 01:41:56,910
Canada Post is now on strike.

1476
01:41:57,470 --> 01:41:58,110
Again.

1477
01:42:01,190 --> 01:42:07,250
I was gonna mail out some of the signed postcards like this week.

1478
01:42:07,850 --> 01:42:08,490
So...

1479
01:42:08,490 --> 01:42:10,270
That's so unfortunate.

1480
01:42:10,890 --> 01:42:12,770
You get used to it.

1481
01:42:13,270 --> 01:42:14,310
Oh my god.

1482
01:42:14,650 --> 01:42:16,910
I would need it to fucking...

1483
01:42:16,910 --> 01:42:18,650
Oh my god, I guess it's pick up time.

1484
01:42:20,770 --> 01:42:21,210
Anyway.

1485
01:42:22,390 --> 01:42:26,010
For those who don't know, Canada Post, for US packages, you're fine, apparently.

1486
01:42:27,750 --> 01:42:31,710
But the Canadians and international orders will be affected.

1487
01:42:32,470 --> 01:42:34,030
Oh my god.

1488
01:42:35,610 --> 01:42:36,610
Oh my god, Canada.

1489
01:42:36,810 --> 01:42:37,250
Please!

1490
01:42:38,490 --> 01:42:40,230
Oh my god, they're smart though.

1491
01:42:40,290 --> 01:42:41,610
They chose the holiday season.

1492
01:42:41,750 --> 01:42:42,450
They're so smart.

1493
01:42:42,530 --> 01:42:51,230
If you wanna get stuff received before the holidays, this is the time you start shipping stuff.

1494
01:42:51,490 --> 01:42:57,630
So they're really smart in choosing this month to strike because people are not getting shit for Christmas.

1495
01:42:57,850 --> 01:42:58,410
That's for sure.

1496
01:43:03,050 --> 01:43:08,970
They have to agree or Christmas is cancelled.

1497
01:43:15,250 --> 01:43:15,770
Simple.

1498
01:43:15,970 --> 01:43:16,930
Thank you for the super chat.

1499
01:43:17,010 --> 01:43:17,330
Thank you.

1500
01:43:19,270 --> 01:43:22,090
Who's on our nickel while you're here in the US?

1501
01:43:22,490 --> 01:43:22,950
Wait, who?

1502
01:43:23,690 --> 01:43:25,050
Who's looking at coins?

1503
01:43:25,710 --> 01:43:28,930
I've been fucking beeping things with my credit card.

1504
01:43:29,130 --> 01:43:31,470
I never received any coins.

1505
01:43:34,330 --> 01:43:35,610
Oh my god.

1506
01:43:35,890 --> 01:43:55,010
I'm so uber brained that I've been taking ubers for so long that I almost just walked out on a taxi because I was like and then the guy when I got to the airport when I came back home yesterday I literally just walked out in a taxi because I thought I was on an uber.

1507
01:43:55,850 --> 01:43:58,510
The taxi guy was like, excuse me ma'am.

1508
01:43:58,750 --> 01:44:00,170
I was like, I'm so sorry.

1509
01:44:00,310 --> 01:44:01,430
I thought I was in an uber.

1510
01:44:04,750 --> 01:44:07,150
I got the uber brain right.

1511
01:44:10,390 --> 01:44:13,190
I legitimately was like, it's already paid for.

1512
01:44:20,170 --> 01:44:22,530
I was so tired too.

1513
01:44:22,650 --> 01:44:23,970
I was so tired.

1514
01:44:24,090 --> 01:44:25,630
I legitimately thought I was in an uber.

1515
01:44:32,610 --> 01:44:33,730
Okay, but yeah.

1516
01:44:33,930 --> 01:44:35,150
That was basically it.

1517
01:44:35,150 --> 01:44:36,570
That was basically it.

1518
01:44:36,650 --> 01:44:37,330
Let's see.

1519
01:44:37,910 --> 01:44:39,770
Oh yeah.

1520
01:44:41,370 --> 01:44:42,570
Wait, never mind.

1521
01:44:43,050 --> 01:44:44,370
I forgot what I wanted to say.

1522
01:44:44,630 --> 01:44:46,130
Oh yeah, nothing by the way.

1523
01:44:49,050 --> 01:44:50,510
Oh yeah, nothing.

1524
01:44:54,230 --> 01:44:57,790
I guess I didn't talk much about seeing mint.

1525
01:44:58,190 --> 01:45:02,570
I feel like we talked about a lot already.

1526
01:45:02,570 --> 01:45:10,230
But during the off collab stream that was like on her channel in the twitter space.

1527
01:45:10,270 --> 01:45:11,950
By the way, we had a twitter space.

1528
01:45:12,410 --> 01:45:19,130
I know some posted an archive of the twitter space because she forgot to fucking record it.

1529
01:45:21,030 --> 01:45:22,810
There wasn't really a lot of stories.

1530
01:45:22,930 --> 01:45:24,250
We didn't get to do a lot of stuff.

1531
01:45:24,470 --> 01:45:25,530
We were just working.

1532
01:45:26,650 --> 01:45:32,930
I just hanged out in her room after dance practices and after work and we would just work even more.

1533
01:45:33,090 --> 01:45:34,230
That's really it.

1534
01:45:34,590 --> 01:45:37,230
We would just work and gossip.

1535
01:45:39,070 --> 01:45:41,390
We didn't do much.

1536
01:45:41,490 --> 01:45:44,650
We were just working and gossiping in her room.

1537
01:45:49,690 --> 01:45:53,050
We couldn't do anything outside of that.

1538
01:45:53,350 --> 01:45:55,010
Legitimately, it's like food.

1539
01:45:55,730 --> 01:45:59,070
The only times outside of work was just getting free food.

1540
01:45:59,190 --> 01:46:00,550
Free dinner and free lunch.

1541
01:46:01,470 --> 01:46:03,090
We were doing girl talk.

1542
01:46:04,010 --> 01:46:07,770
We were doing girl talk.

1543
01:46:11,590 --> 01:46:14,430
Just talking about random stuff in general.

1544
01:46:18,070 --> 01:46:19,210
It's just that.

1545
01:46:21,070 --> 01:46:23,750
Just hearing you chat and hang out was awesome.

1546
01:46:23,850 --> 01:46:25,010
Thank you for the super chat, Nexy.

1547
01:46:25,010 --> 01:46:26,250
Thank you, thank you.

1548
01:46:26,410 --> 01:46:27,170
I'm glad.

1549
01:46:27,810 --> 01:46:29,950
When we saw each other, we hugged.

1550
01:46:31,050 --> 01:46:32,450
She hugged me.

1551
01:46:32,950 --> 01:46:34,910
I don't hug a lot.

1552
01:46:35,330 --> 01:46:40,130
She saw me when we were at the hotel lobby and she hugged me.

1553
01:46:40,510 --> 01:46:41,510
I hugged back.

1554
01:46:45,690 --> 01:46:49,130
It was really fun to hang out with her.

1555
01:46:49,710 --> 01:46:52,890
We did a lot of stuff together at the practice.

1556
01:46:52,890 --> 01:46:56,790
Just hanging out in her room and stuff.

1557
01:47:00,870 --> 01:47:02,190
That's basically it.

1558
01:47:02,290 --> 01:47:03,530
We were like, bye!

1559
01:47:05,330 --> 01:47:10,250
When we left, it was just like, see you next month!

1560
01:47:10,630 --> 01:47:10,910
Bye!

1561
01:47:14,610 --> 01:47:15,810
That's really it.

1562
01:47:16,150 --> 01:47:19,450
I just felt like there was not a lot to really talk about.

1563
01:47:19,450 --> 01:47:27,430
We already talked a lot during the off collab stream and during the twitter space.

1564
01:47:27,550 --> 01:47:30,630
We already talked about what was going on and everything.

1565
01:47:30,790 --> 01:47:31,990
I had nothing new to add.

1566
01:47:32,310 --> 01:47:34,390
We were there for three days.

1567
01:47:34,550 --> 01:47:36,730
There was nothing much to add on to it.

1568
01:47:37,710 --> 01:47:40,250
I said, me and I were just working.

1569
01:47:41,050 --> 01:47:42,670
I had plans.

1570
01:47:42,990 --> 01:47:48,090
I told some of my friends who live near the place that I'll be there.

1571
01:47:48,730 --> 01:47:52,590
I had zero time to meet up with anybody.

1572
01:47:52,910 --> 01:47:53,670
No time.

1573
01:47:53,750 --> 01:48:00,950
We literally spent all our days in the hotel at the studio or eating.

1574
01:48:01,370 --> 01:48:04,410
We had no free time at all.

1575
01:48:04,810 --> 01:48:12,530
Only when I left, my friends were messaging me being like, what's your schedule?

1576
01:48:12,530 --> 01:48:14,870
I was like, I'm on the plane back home.

1577
01:48:14,870 --> 01:48:16,370
I was like, I'm sorry.

1578
01:48:16,790 --> 01:48:19,770
I should've told you guys earlier.

1579
01:48:20,470 --> 01:48:23,870
I literally had zero time.

1580
01:48:26,510 --> 01:48:29,870
I had no time at all.

1581
01:48:29,990 --> 01:48:33,790
I couldn't even message my friends being like, I don't have my schedule.

1582
01:48:33,910 --> 01:48:34,930
It's not free.

1583
01:48:36,710 --> 01:48:38,390
I was like, I'm so sorry.

1584
01:48:38,530 --> 01:48:39,530
All I did was work.

1585
01:48:40,370 --> 01:48:41,830
I'm so sorry.

1586
01:48:41,830 --> 01:48:42,850
Next time.

1587
01:48:43,190 --> 01:48:45,090
I'm already on the plane back.

1588
01:48:45,170 --> 01:48:46,590
I'm so sorry.

1589
01:48:50,230 --> 01:48:52,510
Blade, thank you for the magenta soup.

1590
01:48:52,750 --> 01:48:53,270
Thank you.

1591
01:48:53,350 --> 01:48:57,170
They might give you some brain rot memes or vice versa.

1592
01:48:57,650 --> 01:48:58,890
Blade, thank you for the magenta soup.

1593
01:48:59,070 --> 01:48:59,430
Thank you.

1594
01:49:00,150 --> 01:49:04,170
We're just quoting the wave.

1595
01:49:05,950 --> 01:49:08,950
We were doing the head at the studio.

1596
01:49:09,430 --> 01:49:13,070
We were like, in our 3D models.

1597
01:49:13,250 --> 01:49:16,050
We were like, wave.

1598
01:49:16,430 --> 01:49:20,970
And sticking our head out in our 3D model and stuff.

1599
01:49:21,150 --> 01:49:23,370
We were doing the club penguin dances.

1600
01:49:24,210 --> 01:49:27,470
And like, soldier boy and stuff in 3D.

1601
01:49:31,290 --> 01:49:32,850
Coyote, thank you for the super chat.

1602
01:49:32,970 --> 01:49:33,170
Thank you.

1603
01:49:33,170 --> 01:49:33,750
Thank you.

1604
01:49:34,090 --> 01:49:38,950
Your Aqualad dynamic was so wonderful and funny.

1605
01:49:39,090 --> 01:49:40,490
Thank you for the super chat.

1606
01:49:40,670 --> 01:49:41,530
Thank you.

1607
01:49:41,990 --> 01:49:44,850
We were being really silly.

1608
01:49:46,370 --> 01:49:50,230
We were literally quoting that the last three days.

1609
01:49:50,590 --> 01:49:52,410
We kept quoting it.

1610
01:49:59,310 --> 01:50:01,030
We're Costco guys.

1611
01:50:03,170 --> 01:50:05,770
We actually got brain rotted so hard.

1612
01:50:09,230 --> 01:50:13,170
But yeah, that was basically what we were doing the last three days.

1613
01:50:19,460 --> 01:50:22,760
But yeah, honestly, I missed you guys though.

1614
01:50:22,920 --> 01:50:25,960
I really missed streaming.

1615
01:50:26,640 --> 01:50:28,840
Like I said, I couldn't really stream when I was there.

1616
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:30,020
We were working so much.

1617
01:50:30,440 --> 01:50:31,580
We were so tired.

1618
01:50:31,580 --> 01:50:34,860
Every time I went back to my room, I just passed out.

1619
01:50:34,980 --> 01:50:38,260
I just went to bed and then like, back to work the next day.

1620
01:50:38,580 --> 01:50:43,240
I literally just passed out after hanging out in Min's room.

1621
01:50:43,560 --> 01:50:45,420
I passed out and went to bed and sleep.

1622
01:50:45,740 --> 01:50:47,860
Then wake up, it's work hours.

1623
01:50:48,420 --> 01:50:52,000
It's work hours again.

1624
01:50:52,680 --> 01:50:55,460
So I'm glad to be back and streaming for you guys again.

1625
01:50:55,960 --> 01:50:58,500
Anyway, I'm gonna call it here.

1626
01:50:58,500 --> 01:51:00,060
Chat, I'm gonna call it here.

1627
01:51:00,140 --> 01:51:01,420
I'm gonna run out of things to say.

1628
01:51:01,580 --> 01:51:03,980
But it's really nice to be back here again.

1629
01:51:04,100 --> 01:51:07,840
It's really nice to be back in Canada and hanging out and talking with my dragons again.

1630
01:51:07,920 --> 01:51:10,780
I hope you guys missed me, because I missed you guys.

1631
01:51:12,440 --> 01:51:13,400
Oh wait, before I go.

1632
01:51:13,620 --> 01:51:16,360
So what's the postcard standard for VTuber merch?

1633
01:51:17,200 --> 01:51:17,920
Guys, like...

1634
01:51:18,640 --> 01:51:19,000
Guys!

1635
01:51:19,480 --> 01:51:21,180
Guys, for any of you guys that have the...

1636
01:51:21,180 --> 01:51:23,240
Guys, I need for research purposes, guys.

1637
01:51:25,280 --> 01:51:26,660
What sizes are they?

1638
01:51:26,660 --> 01:51:29,040
Like, I don't know what the international size is.

1639
01:51:29,160 --> 01:51:30,460
Like, I think like...

1640
01:51:30,460 --> 01:51:32,400
My friend says A6 or whatever.

1641
01:51:32,560 --> 01:51:34,660
Like 4.1x5.

1642
01:51:35,740 --> 01:51:38,100
Guys, I know you guys have VTuber postcards.

1643
01:51:38,280 --> 01:51:44,460
I know you guys have it.

1644
01:51:46,930 --> 01:51:48,530
Okay, it's A6.

1645
01:51:48,630 --> 01:51:49,090
Okay, nice.

1646
01:51:49,430 --> 01:51:49,870
Anyway.

1647
01:51:51,310 --> 01:51:53,690
I forgot to talk about this part of the story.

1648
01:51:53,990 --> 01:51:55,230
So I was asking...

1649
01:51:55,230 --> 01:51:56,550
I was asking like...

1650
01:51:57,370 --> 01:51:59,150
So I was asking my friend.

1651
01:51:59,150 --> 01:52:01,570
I was like, how do I get A6 size?

1652
01:52:01,710 --> 01:52:03,350
And then she was like, you don't.

1653
01:52:05,610 --> 01:52:07,390
I was like, how do I...

1654
01:52:07,390 --> 01:52:09,250
How do I do that in NA?

1655
01:52:09,510 --> 01:52:10,430
And she's just like, you don't.

1656
01:52:10,510 --> 01:52:12,010
We don't have the machines for that.

1657
01:52:13,090 --> 01:52:17,370
Unless you want to pay more to have it printed outside of NA.

1658
01:52:17,810 --> 01:52:18,890
And I'm like, oh.

1659
01:52:21,230 --> 01:52:22,450
That's a neat part.

1660
01:52:22,930 --> 01:52:24,610
So we're using 4x...

1661
01:52:24,610 --> 01:52:27,150
So I guess it's gonna be 4x6.

1662
01:52:29,150 --> 01:52:30,830
We have to make do with that.

1663
01:52:34,550 --> 01:52:35,430
Anyway, guys.

1664
01:52:35,690 --> 01:52:36,710
I'm gonna head out now.

1665
01:52:38,230 --> 01:52:40,750
As always, everybody...

1666
01:52:40,750 --> 01:52:45,330
By the way, have you seen FemMedi and FemCaz, the Dragoons?

1667
01:52:45,510 --> 01:52:47,050
Next thing, thank you for the super chat.

1668
01:52:47,370 --> 01:52:50,150
And I will crush it down and make sure it doesn't blow up.

1669
01:52:50,690 --> 01:52:53,010
Unlike Mint, I know how to stop things.

1670
01:52:53,010 --> 01:52:53,710
Thank you.

1671
01:52:57,590 --> 01:52:58,650
As always, everybody.

1672
01:52:58,810 --> 01:53:02,250
Stay hydrated, pause to check, get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

1673
01:53:02,630 --> 01:53:05,330
And you, except for me, head to bed, cause you deserve it.

1674
01:53:05,410 --> 01:53:06,910
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

1675
01:53:07,690 --> 01:53:08,410
Bye, guys.

1676
01:53:08,730 --> 01:53:09,090
Bye.
