1
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:20,210
Hello?

2
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:21,470
Hello, hello?

3
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:23,350
Hello everyone!

4
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:34,110
Hello, Lieutenant Spicy, uh, Skull, hello Major, Michael, Spark, holy shit, who else am I missing?

5
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:36,130
Am I missing anyone else?

6
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:37,430
Michael, hello everyone!

7
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:39,150
We're gonna... gotcha!

8
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:42,710
Alright, uh, it's time.

9
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:46,590
It's time to play the spooky game.

10
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:49,870
Just until the eye is barely visible.

11
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:50,330
Okay.

12
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:51,950
Maybe I should just make it extra bright.

13
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:52,950
Maybe I should just...

14
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:55,990
Hey, TV!

15
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:58,890
Hey, hey, hey, sneaking on him!

16
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:02,650
Alright, maybe I should just make it extra bright so I can't be spooked.

17
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:05,470
I'm scared.

18
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:08,830
I'm actually... I heard it's not that scary.

19
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:17,650
I heard it's just, um... I heard... I heard that, like, it's not as scary as I... as... as, like, all the other games.

20
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:18,770
So that's why I chose this.

21
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:25,310
That's why I... I chose this game because I heard it's not as... not as scary.

22
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,630
Yeah, because it's just all, like, atmospheric.

23
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:29,390
I have no idea what this game is about.

24
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:31,670
I... all I know is that they're on a ship.

25
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:33,230
That's all I know about this game.

26
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:37,370
Um... but, yeah, I've never... I've never heard of playing this before.

27
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:38,990
Little Nightmares is so good.

28
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:40,030
I heard it's really good.

29
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:42,210
I heard there... oh, there are two mouse cursors?

30
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:42,850
Oh, no.

31
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:44,410
Where's the other one?

32
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:45,170
Oh, I see.

33
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:46,230
I see.

34
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:46,690
I see.

35
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:49,050
Okay, I have to...

36
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:56,530
Alright, I know how to fix this, but, um... does it really bother you guys?

37
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:59,170
Okay, I'm gonna fix... it is gonna be a weird fix, chat.

38
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:02,670
I'll fix it real quick for the... for the mouse cursor.

39
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:09,010
Um... um... let me... chat, I'm just gonna fix the... the...

40
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,750
It's to deal with my Lepent.

41
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:13,030
It's to deal with my program, so I'm gonna fix it.

42
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:14,170
Technical difficulties!

43
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:15,430
I know.

44
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:18,370
I know.

45
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:21,230
We're always having technical difficulties here.

46
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:23,890
Um... so I didn't choose Outlast?

47
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:27,050
Yeah, I didn't want to play Outlast because I... it's really spooky.

48
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:32,970
And I've only played, like... I've played, like, three spooky games in my... like, two spooky games in my life.

49
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:36,250
And I'd rather not play... I'd rather not play Outlast, guys.

50
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:38,310
I'd rather go in.

51
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:41,430
Go in with the... the less spooky game for instance.

52
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:45,630
I don't want to go in right into... into, like, the most spooky one.

53
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:48,930
Um... I have... I have to fix it.

54
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:51,150
I'm... because of the... the mouse thingy.

55
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:52,630
It has to deal with my Lepent.

56
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:55,030
I have to, like, put it on the other side and stuff.

57
00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:02,130
So... so... um... this is gonna... it's just me doing technical stuff real quick.

58
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:07,530
Uh... where's my... where's... oh my god, I'm so tiny now.

59
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:08,290
Holy shit.

60
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:09,070
I'm so tiny.

61
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:13,410
Let me fix this chat.

62
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:14,950
I... was it like this?

63
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:17,310
I don't even remember how... how it was looking.

64
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:18,590
Was it... the size?

65
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:20,530
Oh, I don't remember.

66
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:21,870
I don't... is this okay?

67
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:24,810
Is this okay?

68
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:26,650
Uh... bigger?

69
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:27,370
Is this alright?

70
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:27,630
Better?

71
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:28,850
I don't remember.

72
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:31,130
I already forgot what it was supposed to look like.

73
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:31,950
Was it like this?

74
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:32,510
Is this better?

75
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:33,430
Bigger?

76
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:34,170
We're not... okay.

77
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:35,150
Alright, alright, alright.

78
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,130
Uh... take up the whole screen.

79
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:37,250
Okay.

80
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:37,530
Okay.

81
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:38,650
Okay, like this, right?

82
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:39,690
Uh... there you go.

83
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:40,130
Perfect.

84
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:44,110
That's perfect, right?

85
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:48,750
Uh... yeah.

86
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:51,250
This is a very... very spooky video.

87
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,490
It's right in my face.

88
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:54,710
Alright.

89
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:55,550
I forgot.

90
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:57,050
Was it like this size before?

91
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:58,190
Also, I love you.

92
00:03:58,230 --> 00:03:59,350
Thank you so much for the five bits.

93
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:00,030
Thank you.

94
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,550
Thank you so much.

95
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:05,710
Um... but yeah, is the size of... is the size of the model like this okay, chat?

96
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:06,830
Is this okay?

97
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:07,110
Is this okay?

98
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:11,770
Okay.

99
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:15,710
I don't remember how it used to look like.

100
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:17,490
I already forgot, so...

101
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:18,990
Um... I think this is fine.

102
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:20,030
Um...

103
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:23,010
Alright, alright, alright.

104
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:25,090
Let's... let's...

105
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:26,210
Oh, pull it.

106
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:27,270
This is not what I wanted.

107
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:27,730
Whoops.

108
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:29,670
Technical difficulties again.

109
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:33,650
Alright, let's go.

110
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:34,030
Let's go.

111
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:34,770
Embers!

112
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:36,070
Thank you so much!

113
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:36,770
I'm so happy.

114
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:37,030
I'm so happy.

115
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:37,070
I'm so happy.

116
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:39,550
I love you!

117
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:41,390
Embers!

118
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:42,090
Thank you!

119
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:42,530
Woo!

120
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,550
Thank you for the tier one sub for five months.

121
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:48,750
Can we get some bark knights real quick for... for... for Embers?

122
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:49,850
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

123
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:53,090
Also, thank you so much for the 41 bits, lieutenant.

124
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:53,870
Thank you.

125
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:54,870
Alright,

126
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,110
let's start this game.

127
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:01,230
Let me check the settings...

128
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:07,470
Bible pump one, Bible pump one, one, alright, keyboard.

129
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:08,550
Alright.

130
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:09,030
Let's start this game.

131
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:12,810
Alright, let's go in.

132
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:14,170
Let's go in and play this game.

133
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:14,810
Let's start it.

134
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:15,470
Let's start it.

135
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:20,230
Alright, good night, Spacey!

136
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:21,110
Thanks for stopping by!

137
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:21,550
Good night!

138
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:21,830
Good night!

139
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:23,470
Well, we have a good night's rest for school.

140
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,730
Alright, let's... okay.

141
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:28,790
Okay.

142
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:29,990
Mentally preparing myself.

143
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:32,270
I just... I hear it's not that spooky, so...

144
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:35,830
So, let's pray I won't, like, fuck up.

145
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:38,350
I heard it's also a puzzle game, too, so...

146
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:39,130
Thanks, chat.

147
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:39,990
Thank you.

148
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:44,310
Thank you for making me use my brain yet again!

149
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:48,150
Of course you guys would make me use my brain in a spooky game.

150
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:53,550
I can't even see you shake my head.

151
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:57,150
I'm more scared of all these puzzles.

152
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:03,490
Our brain.

153
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:04,010
True, true.

154
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:05,150
We'll use our brain together.

155
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:07,290
Who the fuck is this girl?

156
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:08,410
Who are you?

157
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:13,770
Okay, you'll use your brain more in Visage.

158
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:14,390
Don't worry.

159
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:15,230
Oh my god.

160
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,770
I'll donate my brain cells.

161
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:19,570
All of it.

162
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:21,870
Thank you for your kind donations, chat.

163
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:24,930
Can I move?

164
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:26,350
Oh, I can move.

165
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:29,250
Oh, there's the lighter.

166
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:32,350
Is there a timer on this?

167
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:34,690
Oh, I can pick shit up!

168
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:39,890
Oh, look at that!

169
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:44,490
Look at that!

170
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:46,850
I can pick shit up!

171
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:49,190
I found a can!

172
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:51,150
Oh, wait, I can't hold onto it.

173
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:52,230
Can I bring my can with me?

174
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:54,310
Oh shit, is this a puzzle?

175
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:55,890
Oh my god, am I gonna...

176
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:57,410
Oh, I see, I see, I see.

177
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:58,990
I'm building something here, right?

178
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,830
Okay, no, that wasn't it.

179
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:03,230
Hey, Crush.

180
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,730
Alright, I'm just gonna bring this with me.

181
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:09,570
I can't see shit.

182
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:13,930
Wait, I thought I could pick this up and use the lighter.

183
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:19,390
Hey, Mufi!

184
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:22,930
I can't wait right now because I'm picking shit up.

185
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:24,890
Oh, can I light this?

186
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:30,050
Oh my god, I'm so smart!

187
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:33,970
Maybe go a little bit smaller?

188
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:36,250
Oh, you want my model to be a bit smaller?

189
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,440
You guys want my model to be smaller, chat?

190
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:45,980
What are you doing here?

191
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,780
No, just a little bit?

192
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,920
Okay, let me fix it real quick, guys.

193
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:55,620
For you guys.

194
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,560
Just a little bit.

195
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:02,000
I'll just also move it over here a little bit more.

196
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:04,540
Alright, resume.

197
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,680
Alright, what the fuck do I do?

198
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:11,060
Oh!

199
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,460
Oh, push, pull?

200
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:13,900
Push, pull?

201
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,300
Okay, maybe I have to get my cat out of the way.

202
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,040
Okay.

203
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,200
Push.

204
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:20,720
Oh, pull.

205
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:25,630
Alright, come with me.

206
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:28,230
Come with me.

207
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:29,430
Wait, can I not bring it?

208
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:32,710
Oh my god, this is too... Wait, wait, wait, wait.

209
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:33,650
Let me in.

210
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:36,470
Let me in.

211
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,130
Okay.

212
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:40,690
Oh, okay, I have to crouch.

213
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:41,270
I have to crouch.

214
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:49,940
Okay, I'll just kick it.

215
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:51,720
I'll just kick the can.

216
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:52,880
Okay, nevermind.

217
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:53,240
Fuck you.

218
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,340
I don't need the can.

219
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:57,140
I don't need the can anyway.

220
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:00,640
What?

221
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:02,140
Oh, I climb!

222
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:05,620
Rip the can.

223
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:06,660
I don't need you.

224
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,140
I look up?

225
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,460
Oh, what's this?

226
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,600
What's this?

227
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,820
Wait, can I jump off here?

228
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:32,260
What happens if I... Oh, oh, wait, you can!

229
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,200
I thought that would be an invisible wall!

230
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:39,980
Well...

231
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:47,900
Look, I thought, I thought, you know, there was an invisible wall, you know?

232
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:52,420
Like, you're... It was all just a dream.

233
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,380
You see her wake up.

234
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,660
It was just a dream, chat.

235
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:56,540
Stupid.

236
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:08,990
You guys think the fact that OO is just OO or OO is... What the fuck?

237
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:12,750
Oh, I can jump.

238
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:13,790
Wait, who's that?

239
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:15,490
Who's that?

240
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:18,070
I can pick you up.

241
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:19,170
I can pick you up!

242
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,940
Hey, little girl.

243
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:35,300
Oh my...

244
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,220
Oh, okay, no!

245
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,060
No!

246
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,200
I'm sorry!

247
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,800
I'm sorry!

248
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,360
I didn't know!

249
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,680
I didn't know!

250
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,180
I'm sorry!

251
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,060
Can I push this?

252
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,620
Okay, no.

253
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,060
Wait, what?

254
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:02,080
What the fuck was that?

255
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,560
Wait, what the fuck?

256
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:11,660
It is Neil.

257
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,980
Why is everything so tiny?

258
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,100
The poor stat- You're gonna die now!

259
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,740
That was so bad, thing!

260
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,060
No!

261
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,200
Oh, toilet paper.

262
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,400
Okay.

263
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:25,480
Die here?

264
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:27,120
Oh no, there's a wall here.

265
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,060
Fuck, I have toilet paper.

266
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,840
Okay, I wanna read this.

267
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,080
Pick up the note.

268
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,520
Pick up the note- Oh my god.

269
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,480
Pick up the note- Oh my god.

270
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,080
I don't know what I can- Oh, can I pick up the shoe?

271
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,180
I can pick- I can pick up the shoe!

272
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:46,020
I can pick up the shoe!

273
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,660
I can pick up the shoe!

274
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:57,260
Oh shit, wait, I need a- I need a- They take place in a 20- I can go for like $5000.

275
00:11:59,100 --> 00:11:59,800
Wait- OH!

276
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:00,680
That's a bunny!

277
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:03,660
Oh shit!

278
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,600
Dude, I thought it was just decoration.

279
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,640
I thought it was just a long light.

280
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,480
Honestly.

281
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:14,660
I mean like- You know, I have my priorities straight.

282
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,800
I was like, look at the shoe.

283
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:19,820
And apparently there was- There was a body above me.

284
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,380
Clearly the shoe was a lot more important.

285
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,320
Clearly the shoe was a lot more important.

286
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:27,540
Clearly the shoe was a lot more important.

287
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,040
He was the long boy.

288
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,480
Wait.

289
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:41,780
I'm not spooked yet.

290
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:46,180
This is just a long walking simulator where I pick up shoes.

291
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,060
I'm not spooked yet.

292
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:57,330
The shoe- Yeah, the shoe is more important than every- Oh, can I open this fridge?

293
00:12:58,190 --> 00:12:58,590
Oh!

294
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:01,330
Oh.

295
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:03,550
Oh, there's- Oh, wait, wait, wait.

296
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:04,930
Oh shit!

297
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:06,610
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

298
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:07,890
Come on.

299
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:08,610
Yeah.

300
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:10,030
Oh, there's more shoes!

301
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:11,670
Can I pick up the shoe?

302
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:14,570
Aw, it won't let me pick up the shoe.

303
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:17,410
So it's basically- It's basically just standing.

304
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:19,830
How do I- How do I climb up?

305
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:22,490
Fallen into the toilet.

306
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:30,890
It's just a long- Lieutenant!

307
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:34,350
Thank you so much for the Father Maple's knife!

308
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:38,550
Thank you so much for the- Thank you so much for the- For the gift and sub!

309
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:39,350
Thank you!

310
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:42,090
Can I get some bark knives real quick?

311
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,070
For Lieutenant?

312
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:44,310
For the gift and sub?

313
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:46,370
Oh man.

314
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:48,430
More like little shoes exa- Oh!

315
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:50,210
Wait, what the fuck?

316
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:55,030
I was gonna pick it up!

317
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:57,510
I was like, oh shit!

318
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:58,870
I can pick it up!

319
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:03,430
What the fuck is that?

320
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:06,430
Okay, now I know it's dangerous.

321
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:07,750
It's a dangerous boy.

322
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:09,030
Yeah, that's right.

323
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:09,650
What you gonna do?

324
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:10,670
Yeah, that's right.

325
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:11,070
What you gonna do?

326
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:11,670
Follow me?

327
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:12,170
Yeah.

328
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:12,790
Come on.

329
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:13,470
Come on.

330
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:14,530
Yeah!

331
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:16,210
You can't catch me.

332
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:17,130
Yeah!

333
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:18,690
Yeah, what you gonna do?

334
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:19,030
Huh?

335
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:19,630
Huh?

336
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:20,190
What you gonna do?

337
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:23,750
Yeah?

338
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:24,670
Yeah?

339
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:27,130
It's gonna kill me one day.

340
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:27,610
I'm gonna...

341
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:29,650
Um... I'm gonna leave.

342
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:35,650
Oh, is that another one?

343
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,250
Oh, that's another- Oh, that's more.

344
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:38,690
Oh, there's too many.

345
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:42,170
Oh, they're all following me.

346
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:44,390
Joke's on you guys.

347
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:44,850
I live.

348
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,360
Is that a shoe?

349
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:51,860
Oh, wait.

350
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,700
They're following me.

351
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,880
You're not dropping?

352
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:00,920
Okay.

353
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:02,380
Okay.

354
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,820
Oh, they don't drop.

355
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:12,060
Huh?

356
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,340
Let me...

357
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:21,330
Oh, it doesn't do shit.

358
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:23,190
Okay, I was gonna be like...

359
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:24,870
What you gonna do?

360
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:25,370
Kill me?

361
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:30,470
Pull...

362
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:31,190
Pull?

363
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:31,350
Climb?

364
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:33,230
Climb?

365
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:36,090
Climb?

366
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:36,950
Pull?

367
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:38,030
Oh, pull!

368
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:40,130
What

369
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:46,270
the fuck is that?

370
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:47,190
Woah!

371
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:47,430
No!

372
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:48,530
Ok, hahahaha!

373
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:51,350
Hahaha!

374
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:52,030
Ahahaha!

375
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:53,990
Hahaha!

376
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:56,330
Hahaha!

377
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:03,610
Where am I?

378
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:07,530
Oh, I start here.

379
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:08,090
Okay.

380
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:09,770
Oh no.

381
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:11,050
Wait, no.

382
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:14,550
No, get away.

383
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:20,510
Wait, how do I get out of here?

384
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:21,730
How do I get?

385
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:22,710
Push, push, push, push, push.

386
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:29,510
Okay.

387
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:33,350
I hear this game is like two to three hours long, so I'm going to finish it in an hour.

388
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:36,090
I bet they're whispering for anything.

389
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,950
That's so nasty, right?

390
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:40,850
Oh, the sub goal.

391
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:42,210
Oh, I forgot to swap it.

392
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:43,450
Oh, what are you?

393
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:45,950
What are you?

394
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:49,050
I forgot I was supposed to say 400 instead of three.

395
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:50,250
I forgot to change it.

396
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:52,050
How do I climb?

397
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:53,370
How the fuck do I climb?

398
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:54,910
Please.

399
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:56,390
Oh, you hold on to it.

400
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:58,230
Okay.

401
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:00,990
Can't...

402
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:06,840
What?

403
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:07,380
Can't...

404
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:07,680
What do I do?

405
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,040
Oh.

406
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:10,420
Oh.

407
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:14,460
Apparently I can't climb.

408
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:19,000
I'm all used to climbing chat.

409
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,280
Okay.

410
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:34,070
Okay.

411
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:36,930
Okay, I was going to be like, where's the lights?

412
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:38,630
What

413
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:52,800
the fuck?

414
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,820
There's a fall damage here?

415
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,800
There's a fall damage.

416
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,860
Why the fuck is there fall damage?

417
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:04,920
Oh, wait.

418
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,740
Dying to save time on the run.

419
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:12,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

420
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

421
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,360
There's fall damage.

422
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,820
Okay, look, I have a bed.

423
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:22,640
Okay, please don't touch me.

424
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,060
Please do not touch me.

425
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,080
I had fall...

426
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:26,740
Oh, wait.

427
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:33,500
Okay, how the fuck was I supposed to know there was fall damage here?

428
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:37,300
Okay, I gotta get past this checkpoint so I don't have to do that again.

429
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,420
Also, is the sound okay for you guys?

430
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,540
The sound of the game?

431
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,360
Oh, oh my god, what the fuck?

432
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,920
I forgot about that.

433
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,740
Because I don't know if you guys can hear the game sound.

434
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:56,060
Because it's like very atmospheric.

435
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,240
Okay, alright.

436
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,420
Where do I go then?

437
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:06,580
Okay.

438
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,860
Oh, do I jump?

439
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,000
I jump, right?

440
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:10,680
I jump.

441
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,160
That gnome is actually moving.

442
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:29,330
Okay.

443
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:29,890
Push.

444
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:37,940
Hey, Bippie!

445
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,360
Oh, oh, oh!

446
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,060
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

447
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:47,860
Okay, okay, and then I run.

448
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:49,740
And then I run, and then I run.

449
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:50,920
Can I sprint?

450
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:52,480
Oh, wait, you can sprint!

451
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,380
Why did no one tell me I can sprint here?

452
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,120
I've been fucking walking this entire time!

453
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,660
You can sprint in this game!

454
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,420
Hey, oh yeah, yeah, there, yeah, there.

455
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:06,500
You can sprint, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

456
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:08,020
Yeah, yeah.

457
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,420
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

458
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:12,380
How the... how the fuck?

459
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,040
How the... how the fuck?

460
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:13,120
How the fuck?

461
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,420
Wait, do I jump here?

462
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,760
What if I get dive and fall damage again?

463
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,240
Okay, okay.

464
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,640
Okay, by the way, there's fall damage.

465
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:27,080
Okay, okay, okay, let me see.

466
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:27,740
Alright.

467
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:28,460
Okay.

468
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:28,840
Oh!

469
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,060
Now it tells me!

470
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:32,140
Now the game tells me that I can sprint!

471
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:33,100
Oh, thank you!

472
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:33,760
Thank you!

473
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,680
Now it tells me!

474
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,240
Okay.

475
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,160
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

476
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,300
Oh my god, dude, I'm so fucking good at jumping.

477
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,200
I told you that the last two times!

478
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:51,400
I didn't... I didn't see... I didn't see...

479
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:51,680
Oh!

480
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:52,580
What the fuck?

481
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:59,240
Oh, it just lets out the gnome out.

482
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:07,260
Where does it take me?

483
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:11,990
Wait.

484
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:13,350
Is there a point going up?

485
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:17,670
Oh, no, there's not.

486
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:19,610
There's no reason for me to climb that.

487
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:24,090
Oh, you're gonna scream.

488
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:25,130
Whoa!

489
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:26,510
That gnome is fast.

490
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:27,890
Okay.

491
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:33,390
I'm so fucking good at jumping.

492
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:33,930
Yeah.

493
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:35,130
Exactly.

494
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:36,830
Oh, what was that?

495
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:39,570
Oh, oh, oh, okay, guys!

496
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:40,590
That chocolate man down!

497
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:42,130
Thank you so much for the follow!

498
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:43,410
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

499
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:45,330
Have a... have a butt heart.

500
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:46,250
Thank you so much.

501
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:51,940
Oh, shit.

502
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:59,310
Do you have seven feet tall iron mouth?

503
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:00,910
Let

504
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:07,800
me in.

505
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:08,880
Wait, what?

506
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,080
Let me in.

507
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:11,460
What?

508
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,000
What the?

509
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,520
Let me in.

510
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,180
What?

511
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:14,460
No!

512
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:14,820
No!

513
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,180
Please!

514
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:15,540
No!

515
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:20,420
What the fuck?

516
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:22,720
What the...

517
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,140
Oh, damn it.

518
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:28,760
Oh, god.

519
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:35,800
Are you free of the world record?

520
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:36,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

521
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,920
I can't believe I've only been playing this game for like ten minutes.

522
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:40,340
Oh, shit.

523
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,260
What the fuck is that?

524
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:43,960
Hey, my curious.

525
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:50,970
Okay.

526
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:52,450
Okay, how do I...

527
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:53,750
How do I...

528
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:55,150
Let me in.

529
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:56,890
Let me in.

530
00:22:57,850 --> 00:22:58,650
The fuck do you want?

531
00:22:58,670 --> 00:22:59,290
Oh, okay.

532
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:01,630
I don't know how the fuck I got in.

533
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:02,890
I don't know.

534
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:07,230
I don't know how I got in there.

535
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:08,810
Boom.

536
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:09,810
Let me in.

537
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:12,270
Oh, look, there's rats.

538
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:14,610
And there's toilet paper.

539
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:15,810
Can I take these toilet paper out?

540
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:17,590
Oh, I can't.

541
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:22,420
Toilet paper.

542
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:27,990
Toilet paper.

543
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:33,970
Oh!

544
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:34,410
Oh.

545
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:35,310
Oh.

546
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:39,690
Okay.

547
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:40,130
Alright.

548
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:41,230
That's bad.

549
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:42,830
Electricity bad.

550
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:45,390
Electricity bad.

551
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:48,790
So what's supposed to be... I don't know.

552
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:51,270
Apparently it's like atmospherically scary.

553
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:54,150
But... oh, light.

554
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:54,990
Give me light.

555
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:56,890
Light.

556
00:23:58,130 --> 00:23:58,610
Light.

557
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:06,600
Eat the rat.

558
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,220
Apparently it's a good game though.

559
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:13,020
But I don't know what's scary about it.

560
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:13,700
It's just puzzles.

561
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,520
It's just like a spooky puzzle game.

562
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:20,300
But it's the first scary game.

563
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,420
So we're starting it...

564
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:25,280
We're just starting it with a timid game.

565
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:31,140
I don't know if it'll ever be really scary because it just makes the mood so much lighter.

566
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:32,240
I don't mean to.

567
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:33,600
It's just... I don't know.

568
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,280
I'm just too stupid to make it seem scary.

569
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:38,300
Like...

570
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,260
Why is the hair so tiny?

571
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,760
Look around by using...

572
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:44,960
Wow!

573
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,580
By using arrow keys...

574
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:47,060
Oh shit!

575
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:47,580
Oh!

576
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,140
I was like...

577
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:54,160
Oh shit!

578
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:57,680
I'm looking.

579
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,020
I'm looking respectfully.

580
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:01,000
Hey.

581
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,800
How do I get up though?

582
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:09,920
I looked.

583
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:11,260
I looked.

584
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,940
What do you want me to do afterwards?

585
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:13,760
I'm looking.

586
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,040
Where are you?

587
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,380
Oh, there's something behind this.

588
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:26,210
Oh!

589
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:28,650
That's what I need the toilet paper for.

590
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:30,950
Toilet paper.

591
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:35,090
Just jump?

592
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:39,370
Did you know you can look around?

593
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:40,870
Okay.

594
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:45,730
Like bad.

595
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:48,810
Wait, there's a timer?

596
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:52,490
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, let me through, let me through!

597
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:16,560
Hey.

598
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,240
Okay.

599
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:27,400
There's bloody hand prints on that dresser.

600
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:27,880
Oh, there is!

601
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,320
Look through my hands!

602
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,320
There's a... oh, wait.

603
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:32,120
I can pull!

604
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,940
Oh, I can't.

605
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,140
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

606
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:39,880
I can pull.

607
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:43,240
I... I... I... No, stop picking stuff up.

608
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:43,720
I can pull.

609
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,420
Oh, oh, oh.

610
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:52,540
I can't... I can't walk now.

611
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:53,300
Okay.

612
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:57,700
Okay, what do I do here?

613
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:01,180
Oh, hey.

614
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:02,820

Okay.

619
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:08,940
Wait, wait, what am I supposed to do?

620
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:10,240
Do I dive and do this?

621
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:11,620
Okay, no, I won't.

622
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,340
You're gonna like... you've been on a bed.

623
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,360
I don't know what to do here.

624
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:20,640
Oh.

Don't worry, I'm the best at speedrunning.

761
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,320
Alright, alright, look at this.

762
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:08,860
Bam!

763
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:09,960
I'm fucking running.

764
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,040
I'm fast as fuck.

765
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:17,980
I'm fucking... Please, please stop fucking... I'm the best.

766
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:18,500
Oh my god!

767
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,740
I'm tripping over everything.

768
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,000
I'm fast though.

769
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:21,900
Look at that.

770
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:22,720
I'm so... Oh god.

771
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,720
Please stop tripping.

772
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,640
Holy shit, I'm so...

773
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,580
I'm zooming.

774
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,620
I'm a zoomer.

775
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:30,240
Oh my gosh, look at that.

776
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:30,820
I could've died.

777
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:31,360
Haha.

778
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:37,200
I'm a zoomer.

779
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:39,640
I was born in 2010.

780
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:42,920
Wait, what's that?

781
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:45,100
What?

782
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,800
What the fuck?

783
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:48,680
Is that water?

784
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,560
Well, how old would I be if I was born in 2000?

785
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:55,640
I'll be like 10 years old.

786
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,280
Wait.

787
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,660
Yeah, I'll be 10 years old.

788
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:03,200
What's up?

789
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:03,980
What's up with steel?

790
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:07,910
Boom.

791
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:12,810
I don't know what's the point of all these... Not TOs.

792
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:13,150
Okay, sorry.

793
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:14,490
I was born in 2007.

794
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:16,690
So that would make me...

795
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:19,150
That would make me 13.

796
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:21,730
So I won't get banned.

797
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:22,510
Okay, wait.

798
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:24,990
I realize I should not... What the fuck is that?

799
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:25,890
I realize I shouldn't say that.

800
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:28,410
You could clip that out of context and Twitch will actually think I'm 13.

801
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:29,370
Or like 10.

802
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:33,650
I am legal age to be streaming on Twitch.

803
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:34,770
What's that?

804
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:37,450
What is that?

805
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:41,550
Oh, oh, no, no, no, no.

806
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:43,590
You can't see me because I have this thing.

807
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,100
Yeah, that's right.

808
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,060
Oh, it's an eye.

809
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,200
Okay, I came fast.

810
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:57,640
I'm fast.

811
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:00,760
Oh, oh, jeez.

812
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,660
I'm fast, I'm fast.

813
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:13,580
I'm fast as fuck, I'm fast as fuck, I'm fast as fuck, I'm fast as fu- Are those dead kids?

814
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,620
Are they dead?

815
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:28,590
I'm fast as fuck, I'm fast as fuck, I'm fast as fuck.

816
00:31:32,810 --> 00:31:33,190
Okay,

817
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:38,430
I wanna like this.

818
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:45,300
This won't hurt me.

819
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,900
Yeah, I can't find me.

820
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:48,200
Stupid.

821
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:50,700
Boom.

822
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:53,140
I don't know what that does, but I just want it.

823
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,440
You're really a zoomer?

824
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,580
You were born before 2010?

825
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:58,160
What's that?

826
00:31:58,300 --> 00:31:59,340
Is that a little gnome?

827
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:00,780
What are you doing there?

828
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:01,760
I'm gonna... oh.

829
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:03,000
Oh.

830
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:05,300
Wait, do I pull?

831
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:07,200
Pull.

832
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,080
No, no pulling.

833
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:14,470
Do I climb?

834
00:32:14,650 --> 00:32:15,410
Oh, I climbed!

835
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:17,050
Climb.

836
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:23,560
Should I free that guy?

837
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:25,120
I'm gonna free him.

838
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:26,140
No, you know what, fuck it.

839
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:27,580
I'm not here to do achievements.

840
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:28,180
Fuck you.

841
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:32,340
I don't care about achievements.

842
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:36,760
No.

843
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,740
No one cares about him.

844
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:52,260
Look, hens.

845
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:53,860
Is this my bed?

846
00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:03,650
No, not even- I'm gonna jump at her.

847
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:06,350
Do I jump?

848
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:06,750
Jump.

849
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:13,880
That must be an achievement somewhere.

850
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:15,280
Hide?

851
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,460
Do I need to hide something?

852
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:23,960
Oh!

853
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:26,540
Wait, wait, is this another statue I can throw?

854
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:31,840
Oh, it is!

855
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:35,860
He's our-

856
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:43,930
Oh, I jump!

857
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:45,210
Right?

858
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:47,430
I look, wait.

859
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:48,730
Okay, no, I don't jump.

860
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:49,830
There's nothing there.

861
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:55,230
Is it actually bad to destroy those statues?

862
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:56,310
I don't fucking know.

863
00:33:57,010 --> 00:33:57,450
Push?

864
00:33:58,550 --> 00:33:59,330
Where do I go?

865
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:09,850
Let's see.

866
00:34:09,930 --> 00:34:11,150
I think it's just achievement stuff.

867
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:13,250
I don't care about achievements.

868
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:15,950
I'm just here to get a speedrun.

869
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:18,510
I'm gonna finish this game in an hour, chat.

870
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:22,150
I can't believe I've only been playing for like 10 minutes already.

871
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:23,950
I'm just here to get a speedrun.

872
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:30,660
Do you know that the humming noise is slowly getting faster?

873
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,580
What humming noise is?

874
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,860
What humming noise is?

875
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:56,250
Don't check under the bed.

876
00:34:56,370 --> 00:34:57,530
Don't check under the bed.

877
00:34:57,690 --> 00:34:58,850
Don't check under the bed.

878
00:34:59,270 --> 00:34:59,930
Don't check under the bed!

879
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:00,530
Don't check under the bed!

880
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:06,880
Bye.

881
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:11,680
Bye.

882
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:14,600
Wait, wait.

883
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:15,340
Where do I go?

884
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:16,820
Wait, where do I go?

885
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:21,950
Where do I go?

886
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:25,750
Let me in.

887
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:27,010
Let me in.

888
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:31,450
Up?

889
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:33,510
Where do I go?

890
00:35:34,370 --> 00:35:35,690
He doesn't know.

891
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:37,830
He doesn't know.

892
00:35:42,370 --> 00:35:43,550
He doesn't know.

893
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:45,470
I don't know where to go.

894
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:50,330
Oh!

895
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:52,090
Push!

896
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:52,550
Pull!

897
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:52,930
Pull!

898
00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:54,190
Wait, there has to be an entrance here.

899
00:35:54,490 --> 00:35:54,850
Push!

900
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:56,250
No, no, no.

901
00:35:56,290 --> 00:35:56,650
Pull!

902
00:35:56,810 --> 00:35:57,150
Pull!

903
00:35:57,330 --> 00:35:57,750
Wait, no, no.

904
00:35:57,790 --> 00:35:57,970
Up?

905
00:35:58,430 --> 00:35:58,790
Up?

906
00:35:59,210 --> 00:35:59,570
Up?

907
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:01,750
What the fuck?

908
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:03,670
Where do I go?

909
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:05,930
Wait, how do I push you?

910
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:07,270
How do I push you?

911
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:08,090
What the fuck?

912
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:12,190
Where do I go?

913
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:12,190
Oh!

914
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:12,970
Up!

915
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:14,250
Up, up, up.

916
00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:15,630
Up here.

917
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:18,830
It's up here.

918
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:24,650
I'm so good at this game.

919
00:36:25,370 --> 00:36:25,790
I'm so good at this game.

920
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:27,670
Alright.

921
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:32,770
She's reading it out.

922
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:33,230
She's reading it out.

923
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:35,210
Okay.

924
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:36,170
Okay, I'm safe.

925
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:36,810
I'm safe.

926
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:44,380
Down?

927
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:46,380
No.

928
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:01,750
Oh!

929
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:02,730
Oh, I'm hungry.

930
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:03,670
I'm hungry.

931
00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:06,070
Me too, man.

932
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:10,570
I'll pick this up.

933
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:13,130
Okay, I need food.

934
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,680
Try to surprise her with brain cells after you took them off.

935
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:28,880
Is there like a...

936
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,720
Is there like a time...

937
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:32,400
Like...

938
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:34,220
Is there like a timer?

939
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:35,920
Because of how hungry I am?

940
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,200
Or can I just...

941
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,160
Hey there, kid.

942
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,080
Give me your food.

943
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:40,920
Give me your food.

944
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,280
Hello?

945
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:45,100
Hey.

946
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,480
Hey, give me your food.

947
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:49,780
Yeah, it's me.

948
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:51,540
Hey.

949
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,360
Oh, he gave me food!

950
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:58,160
Yeah, that's right, Sim.

951
00:37:59,000 --> 00:37:59,440
Okay.

952
00:37:59,640 --> 00:37:59,740
Okay.

953
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:00,400
Okay.

954
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:11,170
What a fucking Sim.

955
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:12,690
Yeah, that's right.

956
00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:13,570
I ate your food.

957
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:18,710
That's right.

958
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:21,850
Is he gonna stare at me?

959
00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:23,810
What a freak.

960
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,230
Oh, he's crying!

961
00:38:27,850 --> 00:38:28,930
Yell, little bitch!

962
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:34,250
Yell, you little bitch.

963
00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:36,610
Yell, you little bitch.

964
00:38:36,610 --> 00:38:38,230
I'm gonna cry.

965
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:40,970
Wait, where did I go?

966
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:41,190
Wait, where did I go?

967
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:43,730
No, he's just miming.

968
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:47,830
Oh, shit.

969
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,820
I wonder if that little kid shows up again.

970
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:09,750
Dude, I'm zooming.

971
00:39:10,830 --> 00:39:12,450
I thought you guys said this was...

972
00:39:12,890 --> 00:39:13,930
What are you doing with this?

973
00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:17,890
I thought you guys said this was scary.

974
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:18,030
I'm sorry.

975
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:23,870
I killed you for eating his food.

976
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:25,770
Oh, okay.

977
00:39:25,850 --> 00:39:26,950
So, I don't need this.

978
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:30,150
Can I push this off?

979
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:51,190
Shit, where do I go?

980
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:53,270
Oh, up.

981
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:04,340
Can I go?

982
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,900
Alright, why are you open?

983
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:09,440
Open up.

984
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:11,820
Why do you eat your food?

985
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:14,000
Next time, then it'd be a horror game.

986
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:18,540
Oh, I actually thought I was gonna fuck that up.

987
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:19,700
Can I go up here?

988
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:20,520
Okay, okay.

989
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,120
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

990
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:25,460
Wait, wait, wait.

991
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:26,600
Stop falling.

992
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,580
Stop falling.

993
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:37,520
I don't want to fall down, actually.

994
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:40,800
Okay, okay.

995
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,120
Where do I go after this?

996
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:44,240
Stop?

997
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:44,800
Oh!

998
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:48,600
I go up.

999
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:50,000
Open up.

1000
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:51,000
Okay, well...

1001
00:40:56,970 --> 00:40:58,330
Can I just keep going up?

1002
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:02,350
Okay, I would die if I jump off from there.

1003
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:04,710
I would die if I do that.

1004
00:41:04,850 --> 00:41:05,710
This is fine.

1005
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:06,650
Yeah.

1006
00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:09,910
Oh, oh.

1007
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:19,900
Oh, I guess I...

1008
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:20,660
God, please don't.

1009
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:22,400
Please, please, please.

1010
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:23,360
How do I...

1011
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:25,340
How... how...

1012
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:26,080
How... fuck.

1013
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:28,860
Oh, here?

1014
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:30,540
Yeah.

1015
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:33,440
What the fuck was the ladder for?

1016
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:36,620
What the fuck?

1017
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:37,800
What was this ladder for?

1018
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:39,120
If I could just use that.

1019
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,820
Oh, thank you so much for the follow.

1020
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:43,980
Cold Railgun.

1021
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:44,820
Thank you, thank you.

1022
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:45,980
I do appreciate it.

1023
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,100
Have a butthurt.

1024
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,040
Thank you so much.

1025
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,240
What the fuck was that for?

1026
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:53,540
Excuse me?

1027
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:54,180
Please.

1028
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:54,700
What?

1029
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:00,220
And then... push?

1030
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:01,720
Oh.

1031
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:02,700
Oh.

1032
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:06,260
Huh?

1033
00:42:09,930 --> 00:42:10,570
Huh?

1034
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:12,210
What?

1035
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:16,670
Oh, oh please don't.

1036
00:42:16,690 --> 00:42:17,930
What is this for?

1037
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:19,730
What are you for?

1038
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:24,150
What is this for?

1039
00:42:24,730 --> 00:42:25,850
What is this for?

1040
00:42:25,990 --> 00:42:26,210
What is this for?

1041
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:31,950
Where do we go?

1042
00:42:32,370 --> 00:42:34,170
Trigger... what's trigger of COVID?

1043
00:42:34,990 --> 00:42:35,850
Don't die.

1044
00:42:36,270 --> 00:42:38,130
Oh shit, wait.

1045
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:39,790
Oh.

1046
00:42:41,870 --> 00:42:43,490
Wait, then how do I turn this lever?

1047
00:42:45,390 --> 00:42:46,270
Wait, what?

1048
00:42:46,570 --> 00:42:47,310
Oh hey.

1049
00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:49,190
Then how do I turn this?

1050
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:52,530
I am... I'm so confused.

1051
00:42:52,990 --> 00:42:56,890
I do this and then I run?

1052
00:42:57,150 --> 00:42:58,750
I run... oh I run.

1053
00:42:59,170 --> 00:43:00,950
Oh I'm so fucking smart.

1054
00:43:01,630 --> 00:43:02,130
I'm so fucking smart.

1055
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:02,370
I'm so fucking smart.

1056
00:43:04,970 --> 00:43:05,570
I'm so fucking smart.

1057
00:43:05,570 --> 00:43:06,070
Oh ho ho.

1058
00:43:06,730 --> 00:43:07,330
Hmm.

1059
00:43:10,050 --> 00:43:11,750
Enjoying Little Nightmares so far?

1060
00:43:12,570 --> 00:43:15,090
I think... like... I thought it was spooky.

1061
00:43:15,410 --> 00:43:15,930
I think...

1062
00:43:15,930 --> 00:43:15,930
like...

1063
00:43:15,930 --> 00:43:15,930
I thought it was spooky.

1064
00:43:15,930 --> 00:43:17,930
But it wasn't as spooky as I thought.

1065
00:43:18,450 --> 00:43:19,170
It's just a little bit of a nightmare.

1066
00:43:19,190 --> 00:43:20,030
It's just... it's just atmospheric.

1067
00:43:20,470 --> 00:43:22,030
Oh my gosh, thank you so much for the...

1068
00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:22,530
Look at that!

1069
00:43:22,810 --> 00:43:23,210
Marshall!

1070
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:28,990
Thank you so much for the tier one.

1071
00:43:29,130 --> 00:43:29,850
Six months!

1072
00:43:30,310 --> 00:43:30,590
Woo!

1073
00:43:30,870 --> 00:43:33,030
Can we get some Berk night material quick for Marshall?

1074
00:43:33,250 --> 00:43:34,490
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

1075
00:43:36,170 --> 00:43:39,930
Like, I thought it would be like more spooky than I originally thought.

1076
00:43:40,310 --> 00:43:43,510
But at the moment I'm not spooked at the moment.

1077
00:43:44,110 --> 00:43:44,510
Oh.

1078
00:43:45,470 --> 00:43:45,870
Oh.

1079
00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:47,450
Yeah, that's right.

1080
00:43:49,190 --> 00:43:49,710
This is the first...

1081
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:52,410
This is the first spooky game.

1082
00:43:52,490 --> 00:43:55,650
So we'll gradually get spookier each stream.

1083
00:43:56,270 --> 00:43:57,570
Each variety stream.

1084
00:43:58,190 --> 00:43:58,610
Okay.

1085
00:43:58,670 --> 00:43:59,670
Let me up.

1086
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:03,290
And then...

1087
00:44:03,290 --> 00:44:03,410
Oh.

1088
00:44:04,990 --> 00:44:05,470
Okay.

1089
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:07,770
Not like that.

1090
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:09,350
Okay, not like that.

1091
00:44:09,790 --> 00:44:10,870
Okay, not this.

1092
00:44:17,710 --> 00:44:19,410
No, I'm not gonna play Outlast.

1093
00:44:19,730 --> 00:44:20,090
I...

1094
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:21,730
Oh, my hand!

1095
00:44:21,850 --> 00:44:22,230
What the fuck?

1096
00:44:24,410 --> 00:44:25,990
I didn't even notice it.

1097
00:44:27,390 --> 00:44:28,550
It's just a tracker.

1098
00:44:28,970 --> 00:44:30,390
It was just a tracker.

1099
00:44:31,850 --> 00:44:32,950
No, I do!

1100
00:44:33,030 --> 00:44:34,570
I do have my hand here!

1101
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:35,930
My tracker's working up!

1102
00:44:35,970 --> 00:44:36,390
I'm sorry!

1103
00:44:40,530 --> 00:44:40,970
Okay.

1104
00:44:43,550 --> 00:44:45,010
Alright, is this a nice speed run?

1105
00:44:48,330 --> 00:44:49,470
Would you play Alien?

1106
00:44:49,610 --> 00:44:50,130
I don't know.

1107
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:50,610
I don't know.

1108
00:44:50,690 --> 00:44:54,130
I think I'm gonna play Visage after the next stream.

1109
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:57,630
Visage is scary, right?

1110
00:44:57,910 --> 00:45:00,350
I wanna gradually get scarier.

1111
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:03,950
What's this?

1112
00:45:04,650 --> 00:45:05,130
Oh!

1113
00:45:05,270 --> 00:45:06,750
Oh, that's the news!

1114
00:45:07,090 --> 00:45:08,810
Is Visage scary, chat?

1115
00:45:09,890 --> 00:45:10,670
Oh, who are you?

1116
00:45:10,950 --> 00:45:11,830
Little bitch?

1117
00:45:12,650 --> 00:45:15,470
Alright, we're gonna play Visage next stream.

1118
00:45:16,050 --> 00:45:19,470
Cause I wanted to gradually get spookier each game.

1119
00:45:28,490 --> 00:45:31,990
But like, I'm going into each game blind, so I don't know what the fuck is going on.

1120
00:45:34,450 --> 00:45:35,590
Like, I don't know what the fuck is...

1121
00:45:35,590 --> 00:45:36,510
I don't know what the story is!

1122
00:45:36,610 --> 00:45:37,630
I just know I'm a little girl.

1123
00:45:38,330 --> 00:45:42,110
I'm just a little girl.

1124
00:45:43,130 --> 00:45:43,610
That's all.

1125
00:45:43,990 --> 00:45:44,350
Oh!

1126
00:45:45,690 --> 00:45:47,970
I'm a little tiny girl.

1127
00:45:48,270 --> 00:45:49,770
Fucking running around at a ship.

1128
00:45:52,670 --> 00:45:54,150
And I'm hungry.

1129
00:45:54,250 --> 00:45:54,270
I'm hungry.

1130
00:45:54,770 --> 00:45:55,250
Like...

1131
00:45:56,210 --> 00:45:56,690
Oh.

1132
00:45:58,070 --> 00:45:59,470
Get over the highway.

1133
00:45:59,470 --> 00:45:59,930
I can run.

1134
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:00,870
I can...

1135
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:14,040
I'm a little girl in a yellow raincoat.

1136
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:15,620
That's all that matters in life.

1137
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:19,760
Oh, I just need to go through here.

1138
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:20,380
Why am I climbing?

1139
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:21,780
Why am I climbing?

1140
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:26,760
Oh!

1141
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:29,440
Oh, oh, oh.

1142
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:30,320
Here we go again.

1143
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:33,120
It's okay.

1144
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:35,380
Oh!

1145
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:35,660
No!

1146
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:36,000
Wait!

1147
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:36,320
No!

1148
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:42,700
I thought that hit me.

1149
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:43,580
Okay.

1150
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:47,020
I can zoom.

1151
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:47,620
I can zoom.

1152
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:50,260
Alright.

1153
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:52,000
Alright.

1154
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:52,660
Puzzle time.

1155
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:53,680
Zoom.

1156
00:46:55,940 --> 00:46:57,000
Oh shit, I can slide.

1157
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:05,040
Whatcha gonna do?

1158
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:05,400
Huh?

1159
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:07,780
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

1160
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:09,300
No!

1161
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:11,020
No!

1162
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:12,500
No!

1163
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:14,400
No!

1164
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:20,560
I wasn't fast enough.

1165
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:22,380
I wasn't fast.

1166
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:24,640
I didn't zoom hard enough.

1167
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:27,520
Okay.

1168
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:29,700
Whatcha gonna do, huh?

1169
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:31,480
That's right.

1170
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:33,800
This is what...

1171
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:36,680
This is what she's like to be up here.

1172
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:38,060
I had a bad time as a kid.

1173
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:41,580
There's a thing where like, um...

1174
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:55,520
You're reading a book or something like back then when you don't have like iPhones or whatever and then your mom comes in or your dad comes in and you like fucking hide your book or your Gameboy underneath your covers and pretend to sleep.

1175
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:05,900
That was me.

1176
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:06,580
I did that line.

1177
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:11,680
Is there bunny hopping here?

1178
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:13,220
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1179
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:15,620
I'm bee hopping.

1180
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:20,260
Wait, wait, I think...

1181
00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:22,580
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1182
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:28,020
I got it, I'm so good.

1183
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:30,860
Not even close.

1184
00:48:36,190 --> 00:48:37,150
I'm bee hopping.

1185
00:48:41,930 --> 00:48:45,290
The scariest moment when you realize you knew they were... wait, yeah.

1186
00:48:47,050 --> 00:48:51,350
You can hear their footsteps outside your room and then you're like, oh fuck, and then you hide here.

1187
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:55,490
You're like, whatever you're looking at, underneath your covers or under your pillow.

1188
00:48:55,790 --> 00:49:00,610
And then, close your eyes as they come into your bedroom.

1189
00:49:02,610 --> 00:49:03,730
Hey Nocticity.

1190
00:49:05,070 --> 00:49:07,670
I'm not spooked at all, I'm just vibing.

1191
00:49:08,050 --> 00:49:09,170
I'm just bee hopping.

1192
00:49:09,490 --> 00:49:10,410
I'm not spooked.

1193
00:49:10,830 --> 00:49:11,090
Oh.

1194
00:49:11,390 --> 00:49:14,370
God damn it!

1195
00:49:15,390 --> 00:49:17,830
I thought that was where the staircase was.

1196
00:49:19,490 --> 00:49:22,450
Okay, anyway, I'm not spooked at all, I'm just bee hopping.

1197
00:49:29,090 --> 00:49:30,790
Did you hear him fall?

1198
00:49:30,990 --> 00:49:33,310
I thought that was where the staircase was.

1199
00:49:36,110 --> 00:49:36,970
Can we go here?

1200
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:43,800
Oh, hey there.

1201
00:49:50,170 --> 00:49:51,270
Do I like this?

1202
00:49:51,430 --> 00:49:52,130
I like you.

1203
00:50:00,450 --> 00:50:00,930
Ooh.

1204
00:50:01,850 --> 00:50:02,330
No.

1205
00:50:02,510 --> 00:50:02,730
Did I just open you?

1206
00:50:05,710 --> 00:50:07,050
Did you learn different footsteps?

1207
00:50:07,290 --> 00:50:10,150
Like, I know my mom's footsteps patterns and my dad's.

1208
00:50:11,530 --> 00:50:12,970
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1209
00:50:13,130 --> 00:50:13,630
I did that.

1210
00:50:13,810 --> 00:50:16,530
Like, I would know if it was my mom or dad coming into my room.

1211
00:50:18,910 --> 00:50:19,710
This... what?

1212
00:50:21,030 --> 00:50:22,130
This doesn't take me shit.

1213
00:50:22,690 --> 00:50:23,090
What?

1214
00:50:24,110 --> 00:50:24,770
Wait, what?

1215
00:50:24,990 --> 00:50:26,030
Why can't I go through?

1216
00:50:27,810 --> 00:50:28,550
Let me through!

1217
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:30,650
What are you?

1218
00:50:31,150 --> 00:50:31,710
What?

1219
00:50:33,850 --> 00:50:34,410
What?

1220
00:50:35,770 --> 00:50:37,010
Oh, I need to push.

1221
00:50:37,270 --> 00:50:38,130
I need to...

1222
00:50:38,890 --> 00:50:39,450
Push?

1223
00:50:40,530 --> 00:50:41,090
What?

1224
00:50:42,110 --> 00:50:42,670
Is...

1225
00:50:43,730 --> 00:50:45,770
Am I supposed to go through here?

1226
00:50:46,950 --> 00:50:47,510
Push?

1227
00:50:47,850 --> 00:50:48,690
Oh, fuck this.

1228
00:50:51,510 --> 00:50:52,530
I don't care.

1229
00:50:57,460 --> 00:50:58,440
I don't care.

1230
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:01,580
Okay, I guess we don't go this way.

1231
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:04,160
Wha- wha- wha- what was that?

1232
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:06,660
Wha- what's that sound?

1233
00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:10,840
Wha- Wha- wha- what is that?

1234
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:11,380
What the

1235
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:20,960
fuck is that?

1236
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:22,500
Hey, Juki.

1237
00:51:35,110 --> 00:51:36,070
It goes through now?

1238
00:51:36,770 --> 00:51:37,390
Wait, what?

1239
00:51:37,910 --> 00:51:38,750
What the fuck?

1240
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:39,930
Come on!

1241
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:42,920
Okay.

1242
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:46,500
Are you gonna open again?

1243
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:50,380
Are you gonna open?

1244
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:51,340
It's closed.

1245
00:51:54,740 --> 00:51:55,180
What?

1246
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:57,880
You guys heard that, right?

1247
00:51:58,800 --> 00:51:59,780
I'm so confused.

1248
00:51:59,940 --> 00:52:01,340
Well, I think I can go up here.

1249
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:03,780
I'm pretty sure.

1250
00:52:04,340 --> 00:52:06,120
I can also go up here.

1251
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:11,200
Okay, I don't know what the fuck that room was.

1252
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:13,240
That was- that was spooky though.

1253
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:15,380
Can I open this?

1254
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:16,520
No.

1255
00:52:26,410 --> 00:52:27,490
There's a pressure plate?

1256
00:52:27,570 --> 00:52:28,070
I don't know!

1257
00:52:28,710 --> 00:52:30,210
I don't know what the fuck that was!

1258
00:52:31,570 --> 00:52:33,850
Like, also thank you so much for the follow, Ravioli!

1259
00:52:34,010 --> 00:52:34,890
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

1260
00:52:35,010 --> 00:52:36,490
Have a- have a butthurt.

1261
00:52:36,530 --> 00:52:37,530
Thank you so much.

1262
00:52:38,610 --> 00:52:39,330
Wait, really?

1263
00:52:39,730 --> 00:52:40,570
Okay, let me check.

1264
00:52:40,630 --> 00:52:41,510
Let me look at it again.

1265
00:52:41,670 --> 00:52:42,710
Let me look at it.

1266
00:52:44,250 --> 00:52:45,730
Let me- Let me see that again.

1267
00:52:45,830 --> 00:52:46,550
I'm- I was curious.

1268
00:52:46,810 --> 00:52:47,790
That- that spooked me.

1269
00:52:50,890 --> 00:52:52,910
I bet you that's what they do to speedrun this.

1270
00:52:54,130 --> 00:52:56,110
They do little bunny hops like this.

1271
00:52:56,550 --> 00:52:58,510
No, there's no pressure plate here though.

1272
00:52:58,670 --> 00:52:58,830
Oh!

1273
00:52:58,990 --> 00:52:59,610
Oh, there is!

1274
00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:00,210
Oh!

1275
00:53:01,470 --> 00:53:02,390
You're so smart!

1276
00:53:02,710 --> 00:53:07,850
Holy shit, look at- Wait, then what the fuck do we do upstairs?

1277
00:53:10,710 --> 00:53:11,690
There it is!

1278
00:53:13,290 --> 00:53:15,190
But, what about upstairs though?

1279
00:53:15,530 --> 00:53:16,630
I don't know where to go.

1280
00:53:16,730 --> 00:53:17,950
Do we go up or here, chat?

1281
00:53:18,050 --> 00:53:19,090
Which one should we try?

1282
00:53:20,270 --> 00:53:22,770
Okay, let me- let me bring this light down.

1283
00:53:22,770 --> 00:53:25,510
Should we go up or right?

1284
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:26,530
Here?

1285
00:53:26,710 --> 00:53:28,350
Okay, let me bring you with me.

1286
00:53:28,450 --> 00:53:29,590
Maybe this is heavy enough.

1287
00:53:36,060 --> 00:53:36,760
Okay, okay.

1288
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:50,180
Okay, where does this take me?

1289
00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:51,460
Button?

1290
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:56,800
Hey.

1291
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:02,420
What's this?

1292
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:06,320
Stupid.

1293
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:07,540
Oh.

1294
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:08,520
Oh, no!

1295
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:11,060
What is this?

1296
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:16,660
Oh, I remember this!

1297
00:54:16,780 --> 00:54:17,480
I know this guy!

1298
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:18,780
I've seen this guy before!

1299
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:24,260
And like, when other people were playing this game, I remember seeing the creepy chef.

1300
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:27,320
This is all here before.

1301
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:30,020
Oh, who are you?

1302
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:37,400
I'm not learning nothing.

1303
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:45,560
I- I think this is for like, plot and stuff, but I'm- I'm not really learning anything.

1304
00:54:51,380 --> 00:54:52,260
Is that it?

1305
00:54:52,540 --> 00:54:53,840
Oh, is this plot?

1306
00:54:54,660 --> 00:54:56,160
Oh, shit, this is plot!

1307
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:59,140
So like- wait, what the fuck?

1308
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:01,420
That's new.

1309
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:03,200
What's this?

1310
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:05,860
Plot.

1311
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:08,600
Wait, what?

1312
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:10,340
Oh,

1313
00:55:13,910 --> 00:55:14,950
what are you?

1314
00:55:17,570 --> 00:55:18,690
What the fuck are you?

1315
00:55:19,990 --> 00:55:20,710
Okay, bye.

1316
00:55:21,130 --> 00:55:27,410
I- I guess I was learning plot the entire time.

1317
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:32,210
I have no idea what I learned today.

1318
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:44,340
Oh, no!

1319
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:45,040
No, fuck!

1320
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:50,860
No!

1321
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:54,220
No!

1322
00:55:55,690 --> 00:55:56,000
No!

1323
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:57,840
I'm back here!

1324
00:55:58,180 --> 00:56:00,220
I'm back here!

1325
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:10,840
I- I am- Is that a thing to- To do plot again?

1326
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:13,040
Oh, gives up to you.

1327
00:56:13,060 --> 00:56:14,000
But not .

1328
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:14,680
So.

1329
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:20,180
Photoshop, thank you so much for the- for the photo!

1330
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:20,900
Thank you.

1331
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:21,200
Thank you.

1332
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:22,240
I do appreciate it.

1333
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:23,340
Thank you so much.

1334
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:24,120
Have a fun work.

1335
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:24,780
Thank you.

1336
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:25,480
.

1337
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:28,160
I'm not really able- What did I learn today?

1338
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:29,120
Also devil.

1339
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:30,060
Uh.

1340
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:34,820
I'm freaking nut.

1341
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:35,140
Okay.

1342
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:37,020
Thank you so much for the follow.

1343
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:38,040
I do appreciate it.

1344
00:56:38,180 --> 00:56:39,360
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1345
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:40,940
Also have a blood heart.

1346
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:42,480
Okay, do I have to do plot again?

1347
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:43,340
Plot.

1348
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:49,200
I don't know if it's like a thing that I have to...

1349
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:50,640
No, we'll do plot again.

1350
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:51,660
Let's go.

1351
00:56:55,260 --> 00:56:57,140
We usually have some Bortle, right?

1352
00:56:57,800 --> 00:56:58,800
Alright, plot time.

1353
00:57:01,860 --> 00:57:03,380
I don't know if it like keeps it.

1354
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:04,240
Does it keep it?

1355
00:57:04,860 --> 00:57:05,940
Oh, no it doesn't.

1356
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:06,480
Okay, okay.

1357
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:07,460
Speedrun plot.

1358
00:57:07,940 --> 00:57:08,600
Speedrun plot.

1359
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:11,880
Speedrun.

1360
00:57:11,980 --> 00:57:12,780
We're speedrunning.

1361
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:16,800
Please, let me keep pressing.

1362
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:18,360
Hey, Jackie-san!

1363
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:20,920
Alright, I'm gonna plot.

1364
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:21,800
Alright, done.

1365
00:57:23,580 --> 00:57:24,680
We spedrun plot.

1366
00:57:24,780 --> 00:57:25,260
We've learned.

1367
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:28,680
We've learned about her past and where she came from.

1368
00:57:34,150 --> 00:57:34,710
Okay.

1369
00:57:38,110 --> 00:57:39,430
I'm gonna go back up.

1370
00:57:39,990 --> 00:57:42,110
Have I learned from my mistakes?

1371
00:57:42,290 --> 00:57:42,910
Not really.

1372
00:57:45,750 --> 00:57:47,890
I have not really learned.

1373
00:57:49,930 --> 00:57:52,090
Oh my god, you can't see that?

1374
00:57:54,510 --> 00:57:55,750
Wait, wait, let me do that again.

1375
00:57:57,310 --> 00:57:58,430
Oh god.

1376
00:57:59,790 --> 00:58:02,190
This is supposed to be a spooky game.

1377
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:10,040
Boom.

1378
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:13,260
Oh, can I open this?

1379
00:58:14,020 --> 00:58:14,580
No.

1380
00:58:15,460 --> 00:58:17,500
This girl has mad endurance, right?

1381
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:20,600
She's like strong as fuck, apparently.

1382
00:58:20,660 --> 00:58:21,720
Like, look at that.

1383
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:25,360
What do I do with you?

1384
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:31,650
Clutch?

1385
00:58:34,630 --> 00:58:36,310
Okay, not like that.

1386
00:58:38,450 --> 00:58:39,010
Oh!

1387
00:58:41,850 --> 00:58:42,370
Chew.

1388
00:58:48,820 --> 00:58:51,140
Oh, I should have pushed this over there.

1389
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:55,020
Okay.

1390
00:58:55,580 --> 00:58:57,960
This is a bit slow.

1391
00:59:11,140 --> 00:59:12,140
Is that a dog?

1392
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:14,940
Holy shit, that's an u- like, what the fuck?

1393
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:16,120
Wait.

1394
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:20,280
Is that- is that- does he have a freaking dick as a nose?

1395
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:22,340
Chat, you see that, right?

1396
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:24,560
Like, what?

1397
00:59:28,220 --> 00:59:29,640
You guys see that?

1398
00:59:36,050 --> 00:59:37,830
I just- oh, wait, no.

1399
00:59:38,110 --> 00:59:38,970
That's not a dog.

1400
00:59:39,130 --> 00:59:39,330
Wait.

1401
00:59:39,390 --> 00:59:40,230
That's not a dog.

1402
00:59:40,370 --> 00:59:43,270
I thought it was- I thought it was a dog.

1403
00:59:45,990 --> 00:59:47,450
I just had to look closer.

1404
00:59:47,670 --> 00:59:49,350
It was- I don't know what the fuck that was.

1405
00:59:50,650 --> 00:59:53,790
But his nose was a big peepee on Angie right there.

1406
00:59:55,990 --> 00:59:56,950
Is it timed?

1407
01:00:04,230 --> 01:00:05,090
What are you speaking?

1408
01:00:05,250 --> 01:00:07,530
Does this mean the complete opposite for me?

1409
01:00:13,190 --> 01:00:13,670
Okay.

1410
01:00:13,670 --> 01:00:14,550
Where did I go?

1411
01:00:16,190 --> 01:00:16,670
Here?

1412
01:00:18,150 --> 01:00:18,630
Oh.

1413
01:00:18,630 --> 01:00:19,550
No, no, no, no, no!

1414
01:00:24,450 --> 01:00:26,170
That was not where I go.

1415
01:00:26,570 --> 01:00:28,330
That was not where I go.

1416
01:00:28,330 --> 01:00:32,530
Oh, I have to push it again.

1417
01:00:32,990 --> 01:00:33,350
No!

1418
01:00:36,620 --> 01:00:37,140
No!

1419
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:44,140
Why couldn't they just give me the suitcase where it was?

1420
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:55,740
I wonder how far we are already in this game.

1421
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:59,720
Because it's supposed to be a two to three hour game.

1422
01:01:00,140 --> 01:01:02,660
And I'm already- I've already played this game for ten minutes.

1423
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:06,580
Why is it so spooky?

1424
01:01:06,580 --> 01:01:06,860
It's supposed to be spooky.

1425
01:01:14,020 --> 01:01:15,720
What's the spooky noise for?

1426
01:01:18,940 --> 01:01:22,380
Okay, clearly the light has no meaning.

1427
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:23,580
Oh shit!

1428
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:24,920
Who you?

1429
01:01:25,620 --> 01:01:26,780
Who you mister?

1430
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:31,740
He doesn't have hair and he's wearing a hat.

1431
01:01:32,020 --> 01:01:32,700
You know what I say?

1432
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:33,540
We don't need hair.

1433
01:01:33,740 --> 01:01:34,800
Just wear a hat.

1434
01:01:35,860 --> 01:01:36,700
He's okay.

1435
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:37,500
He looks okay.

1436
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:39,840
The fuck is his eyes now?

1437
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:42,060
Oh!

1438
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:42,760
Oh no no no!

1439
01:01:43,980 --> 01:01:45,420
Did I turn you on?

1440
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:46,740
What?

1441
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:47,200
Hey.

1442
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:51,120
Okay, I guess I do that again.

1443
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:52,700
Because I fucked up.

1444
01:01:58,320 --> 01:01:59,820
True, I'm probably almost done.

1445
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:00,940
Oh, there's a key.

1446
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:02,520
There's a key down there!

1447
01:02:04,180 --> 01:02:05,840
I didn't see the key.

1448
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:08,080
Where do I use the key then?

1449
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:11,440
Okay, key.

1450
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:13,960
Boop.

1451
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:15,140
Boop.

1452
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:15,760
Key.

1453
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:19,020
Bye.

1454
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:26,180
Okay, I thought I died there.

1455
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:28,240
Okay, where do I use you?

1456
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:33,020
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.

1457
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:37,450
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.

1458
01:02:38,570 --> 01:02:39,950
Okay, where do I?

1459
01:02:39,950 --> 01:02:40,690
Do I know?

1460
01:02:42,530 --> 01:02:45,090
Where the fuck do I use the key?

1461
01:02:45,430 --> 01:02:46,030
Uh.

1462
01:02:47,630 --> 01:02:48,690
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.

1463
01:02:48,690 --> 01:02:51,390
Do do do... do do do...

1464
01:02:51,390 --> 01:02:52,250
Did I fuck up?

1465
01:02:52,450 --> 01:02:53,790
Am I not supposed to eat this?

1466
01:02:55,670 --> 01:02:56,210
Wait...

1467
01:03:00,220 --> 01:03:01,420
What do you do with you?

1468
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:04,140
Uh...

1469
01:03:07,540 --> 01:03:08,080
Suitcase?

1470
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:10,820
No...

1471
01:03:10,820 --> 01:03:13,700
Okay... I don't know what to do with you!

1472
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:17,620
Key!

1473
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:21,720
Key!

1474
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:24,320
Uh...

1475
01:03:26,980 --> 01:03:27,660
Key...

1476
01:03:35,130 --> 01:03:35,810
Key?

1477
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:41,060
Key?

1478
01:03:44,180 --> 01:03:44,860
Key?

1479
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:55,060
Okay, I feel like this key... there's nothing... I feel like this key... there was nothing to do with this key.

1480
01:03:55,260 --> 01:03:57,680
I just brought it down for no reason.

1481
01:03:59,900 --> 01:04:01,300
Okay, I go back...

1482
01:04:02,140 --> 01:04:04,120
You'll figure it out, I'm figuring it out.

1483
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:06,960
She's learning those notes as Danny promises.

1484
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:11,340
What do I do with the key?

1485
01:04:12,220 --> 01:04:13,600
Where is the lock?

1486
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:15,140
Okay, wait, if I look up?

1487
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:16,640
No...

1488
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:18,000
No?

1489
01:04:20,020 --> 01:04:20,540
No...

1490
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:22,520
I'm looking...

1491
01:04:24,540 --> 01:04:25,060
Boom...

1492
01:04:26,300 --> 01:04:27,920
Okay, do I go up here?

1493
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:29,220
Hey...

1494
01:04:30,340 --> 01:04:30,880
Hey...

1495
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:32,220
Oh... no... no... no, no, no!

1496
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:32,560
No!

1497
01:04:32,780 --> 01:04:32,940
No!

1498
01:04:33,060 --> 01:04:33,200
Pfft!

1499
01:04:35,380 --> 01:04:36,960
Where is the key?

1500
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:38,140
Where...

1501
01:04:44,300 --> 01:04:44,840
Okay...

1502
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:46,040
Okay, maybe here.

1503
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:47,860
Oh, you can climb up this!

1504
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:50,380
Oh...

1505
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:52,960
Oh... is that a dead guy?

1506
01:04:53,260 --> 01:04:54,360
What the fuck is that?

1507
01:04:57,120 --> 01:04:58,100
What are you?

1508
01:04:59,080 --> 01:05:00,140
Oh, it's just pants.

1509
01:05:00,620 --> 01:05:01,440
It's just...

1510
01:05:02,110 --> 01:05:02,380
That's...

1511
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:05,920
It's just his pants.

1512
01:05:06,680 --> 01:05:07,280
Okay...

1513
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:09,480
What do I do here?

1514
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:16,300
Oh, I'm alive.

1515
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:18,680
Oh...

1516
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:20,860
Where's the key?

1517
01:05:21,620 --> 01:05:22,920
Where... where'd the key go?

1518
01:05:31,150 --> 01:05:32,470
Oh my god!

1519
01:05:33,430 --> 01:05:34,810
Can I push this?

1520
01:05:36,090 --> 01:05:37,910
Oh, why did you just kill me?

1521
01:05:38,190 --> 01:05:39,630
Oh, my god!

1522
01:05:43,980 --> 01:05:44,580
Oh, my god!

1523
01:05:44,580 --> 01:05:45,600
Oh, my god!

1524
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:46,220
Oh, my god!

1525
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:46,580
Oh, my god!

1526
01:05:46,580 --> 01:05:49,480
Oh, my fucking god!

1527
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:51,740
Oh...

1528
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:56,060
I got...

1529
01:05:57,840 --> 01:05:58,800
I'm...

1530
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:00,000
I got...

1531
01:06:02,420 --> 01:06:03,380
I'm dead.

1532
01:06:03,700 --> 01:06:04,660
I'm...

1533
01:06:04,660 --> 01:06:06,280
I'm dead.

1534
01:06:06,700 --> 01:06:07,660
I...

1535
01:06:10,360 --> 01:06:11,500
I'm dead.

1536
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:11,760
I hit him.

1537
01:06:12,220 --> 01:06:12,600
I...

1538
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:17,560
I...

1539
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:17,600
I...

1540
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:17,840
I...

1541
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:18,220
Oh...

1542
01:06:18,220 --> 01:06:18,300
No!

1543
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:23,440
Oh my god, she was climbing up!

1544
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:26,120
Alright, give me the key.

1545
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:28,160
Give it to me.

1546
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,360
I'm a baby.

1547
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:35,120
I'm fucking...

1548
01:06:35,620 --> 01:06:36,460
Here we go.

1549
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:37,720
Look at that speedrun chat.

1550
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:38,640
Look at that.

1551
01:06:38,820 --> 01:06:39,500
It's not like...

1552
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:41,280
It's not like I died or anything.

1553
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:44,880
Hey, Eddy!

1554
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:47,160
Yeah, I don't need you.

1555
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:48,660
Stupid key.

1556
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:55,720
I'm so fast.

1557
01:06:56,420 --> 01:06:57,240
What do I do?

1558
01:07:17,650 --> 01:07:18,170
What?

1559
01:07:18,790 --> 01:07:20,050
Do I chuck you?

1560
01:07:23,310 --> 01:07:23,830
Uh.

1561
01:07:24,730 --> 01:07:25,250
Oh.

1562
01:07:26,570 --> 01:07:30,070
Wait, can I just push this open?

1563
01:07:30,430 --> 01:07:30,950
No.

1564
01:07:34,990 --> 01:07:38,050
What the fuck do I...carrying an object hold... Yeah!

1565
01:07:38,990 --> 01:07:40,030
I did!

1566
01:07:40,970 --> 01:07:42,090
What the fuck?

1567
01:07:42,250 --> 01:07:42,450
What?

1568
01:07:43,930 --> 01:07:44,610
What?

1569
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:48,750
I'm chucking!

1570
01:07:51,770 --> 01:07:53,050
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1571
01:07:57,110 --> 01:07:58,470
Come on!

1572
01:07:58,670 --> 01:07:59,850
Oh my god.

1573
01:08:00,610 --> 01:08:01,990
Now it works?

1574
01:08:02,930 --> 01:08:03,690
I don't know.

1575
01:08:03,750 --> 01:08:05,650
I don't even know how far we are, Embers.

1576
01:08:06,090 --> 01:08:06,870
I don't know.

1577
01:08:07,030 --> 01:08:08,570
Are we pretty far in this game?

1578
01:08:08,790 --> 01:08:10,110
Please tell me we're pretty far.

1579
01:08:10,210 --> 01:08:14,390
Please don't tell me we're only 20% down...done with this game.

1580
01:08:18,270 --> 01:08:19,110
There's no way.

1581
01:08:19,210 --> 01:08:19,890
There's no way.

1582
01:08:20,870 --> 01:08:23,010
There's no way there's more to it.

1583
01:08:26,470 --> 01:08:27,210
I don't know.

1584
01:08:27,270 --> 01:08:28,610
We're still in the dark.

1585
01:08:31,690 --> 01:08:34,070
I've never...yeah, I've never played this so I don't fucking know.

1586
01:08:34,130 --> 01:08:35,090
What?

1587
01:08:36,390 --> 01:08:37,630
Can I push you?

1588
01:08:39,210 --> 01:08:39,850
Uh.

1589
01:08:42,870 --> 01:08:43,510
No?

1590
01:08:45,650 --> 01:08:46,290
No?

1591
01:08:46,290 --> 01:08:46,930
No?

1592
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:54,600
I'm in a box.

1593
01:08:56,980 --> 01:08:57,620
I'm in a box.

1594
01:08:57,780 --> 01:09:00,360
We passed Longboy from the...

1595
01:09:00,360 --> 01:09:01,120
We passed Longboy from the...

1596
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:02,020
in the baby thingy.

1597
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:03,240
In the baby thing.

1598
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:06,020
There was like a bunch of babies and we passed him.

1599
01:09:10,120 --> 01:09:11,240
What the fuck?

1600
01:09:11,340 --> 01:09:11,960
What the fuck?

1601
01:09:12,580 --> 01:09:13,580
Did I bring you back?

1602
01:09:14,100 --> 01:09:15,120
Alright, where are you?

1603
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:15,920
I'm bringing you back.

1604
01:09:19,220 --> 01:09:21,260
I don't fucking know what we're doing with you.

1605
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:22,400
I don't know.

1606
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:25,200
Do something.

1607
01:09:27,340 --> 01:09:29,720
He's not doing anything so I don't know anymore.

1608
01:09:37,940 --> 01:09:38,800
I don't know.

1609
01:09:44,340 --> 01:09:45,140
I'm climbing.

1610
01:09:45,340 --> 01:09:45,740
I'm...

1611
01:09:46,900 --> 01:09:47,300
Where?

1612
01:09:47,860 --> 01:09:49,180
What do you want me to do?

1613
01:09:49,900 --> 01:09:50,880
What do you...

1614
01:09:52,180 --> 01:09:54,180
His mirror's light getting brighter.

1615
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:55,020
What the fuck?

1616
01:10:00,170 --> 01:10:01,510
I'm just stuck here.

1617
01:10:04,670 --> 01:10:05,010
Oh!

1618
01:10:09,610 --> 01:10:10,290
Oh?

1619
01:10:11,430 --> 01:10:12,110
Oh?

1620
01:10:12,710 --> 01:10:13,750
Okay, no.

1621
01:10:13,910 --> 01:10:14,870
Wait, no?

1622
01:10:16,390 --> 01:10:17,070
No?

1623
01:10:19,130 --> 01:10:19,810
Please!

1624
01:10:20,410 --> 01:10:21,010
Okay!

1625
01:10:21,010 --> 01:10:23,190
I'm just bad at aiming, I guess.

1626
01:10:23,510 --> 01:10:25,730
I'm just... I'm just bad at aim.

1627
01:10:29,530 --> 01:10:30,610
Did he bring you?

1628
01:10:31,250 --> 01:10:32,190
That's so smart.

1629
01:10:57,460 --> 01:10:58,880
Okay, are you hungry again?

1630
01:10:59,340 --> 01:11:00,800
Oh, you little bitch.

1631
01:11:01,740 --> 01:11:02,760
Alright, don't worry.

1632
01:11:02,980 --> 01:11:04,080
We'll get you food.

1633
01:11:04,780 --> 01:11:05,300
Okay.

1634
01:11:05,700 --> 01:11:07,340
Don't worry, I'm gonna get you food.

1635
01:11:08,420 --> 01:11:10,460
Don't worry, please just keep jumping.

1636
01:11:19,300 --> 01:11:21,080
Oh no, please, please.

1637
01:11:21,220 --> 01:11:22,240
I'm gonna get you food.

1638
01:11:23,050 --> 01:11:24,640
Please just walk for...

1639
01:11:27,980 --> 01:11:30,020
Oh, I can't jump anymore.

1640
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:31,560
I'm too hungry.

1641
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:33,560
Hey, metal.

1642
01:11:36,100 --> 01:11:37,800
Oh shit, is that me?

1643
01:11:46,050 --> 01:11:47,390
Oh god, that's disgusting.

1644
01:11:49,370 --> 01:11:49,950
Oh

1645
01:12:07,830 --> 01:12:10,290
my god, what the fuck is wrong with your hands?

1646
01:12:10,570 --> 01:12:11,370
Oh come on!

1647
01:12:11,370 --> 01:12:11,710
Oh, I'm gonna get you food.

1648
01:12:12,570 --> 01:12:13,810
Clefie, thank you so much.

1649
01:12:13,830 --> 01:12:14,810
We're gonna fly in minutes.

1650
01:12:15,030 --> 01:12:16,210
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1651
01:12:16,250 --> 01:12:17,170
I do appreciate it.

1652
01:12:17,190 --> 01:12:17,970
Thank you so much.

1653
01:12:20,290 --> 01:12:21,130
What is he...

1654
01:12:22,350 --> 01:12:23,270
What is he doing?

1655
01:12:24,070 --> 01:12:24,790
Let me out.

1656
01:12:26,790 --> 01:12:27,230
Oh.

1657
01:12:27,530 --> 01:12:27,970
Oh.

1658
01:12:28,410 --> 01:12:28,930
Oh yeah.

1659
01:12:30,250 --> 01:12:30,690
Yeah,

1660
01:12:34,890 --> 01:12:35,510
that's right.

1661
01:12:36,630 --> 01:12:37,590
That's looking right.

1662
01:12:37,590 --> 01:12:37,970
I'm leaving.

1663
01:12:38,370 --> 01:12:39,070
I'm leaving.

1664
01:12:39,590 --> 01:12:40,030
Bye.

1665
01:12:45,710 --> 01:12:48,570
Yeah, I don't give a fuck about the little other people trapped there.

1666
01:12:48,970 --> 01:12:50,070
They're each their own.

1667
01:12:50,330 --> 01:12:51,030
I just go here?

1668
01:12:52,030 --> 01:12:52,650
Oh, okay.

1669
01:12:52,710 --> 01:12:53,450
I do not go there.

1670
01:12:58,070 --> 01:12:59,870
Okay, we learned that...

1671
01:12:59,870 --> 01:13:01,130
that I do not...

1672
01:13:01,130 --> 01:13:03,610
Oh my god, you're gonna make me watch this...

1673
01:13:03,610 --> 01:13:04,490
I'm sorry!

1674
01:13:05,170 --> 01:13:07,850
It's gonna make me watch this cutscene again!

1675
01:13:08,770 --> 01:13:09,810
I'm sorry!

1676
01:13:16,230 --> 01:13:17,790
I won't do it again!

1677
01:13:18,170 --> 01:13:19,730
I won't do it again!

1678
01:13:19,730 --> 01:13:20,330
I won't do it again!

1679
01:13:21,430 --> 01:13:22,330
Okay, alright.

1680
01:13:22,670 --> 01:13:23,110
Alright.

1681
01:13:25,150 --> 01:13:25,670
Okay.

1682
01:13:25,870 --> 01:13:27,230
Well, now I know.

1683
01:13:27,770 --> 01:13:28,970
Now I know.

1684
01:13:30,710 --> 01:13:31,870
Okay, I know...

1685
01:13:31,870 --> 01:13:33,230
we go through here, right?

1686
01:13:33,390 --> 01:13:34,610
Okay, what the fuck do we do now?

1687

What you're supposed to bring me, cute?

1847
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:48,600
I got it for nourishing me with spit.

1848
01:20:48,700 --> 01:20:49,520
I need to hydrate.

1849
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:51,720
I need to hydrate after that.

I'm screaming right now.

1860
01:21:08,460 --> 01:21:09,280
What do you mean?

1861
01:21:09,340 --> 01:21:10,720

1874
01:21:39,480 --> 01:21:40,120
Wait.

1875
01:21:40,540 --> 01:21:41,180
Okay.

1876
01:21:41,240 --> 01:21:41,820
Let me look.

1877
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:43,240
Let me look.

1878
01:21:43,900 --> 01:21:44,540
Oh.

1879
01:21:47,960 --> 01:21:48,600
Okay.

1880
01:21:49,860 --> 01:21:50,500
Oh.

1881
01:21:51,820 --> 01:21:52,460
Please.

1882
01:21:52,680 --> 01:21:53,080
Please.

1883
01:21:53,100 --> 01:21:53,500
Please.

1884
01:21:53,560 --> 01:21:53,920
Please.

1885
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:54,160
Please.

1886
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:55,120
Let me up!

1887
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:55,680
Let me up!

1888
01:21:55,900 --> 01:21:58,300
Let me up.

1889
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:01,140
Let me up.

1890
01:22:01,580 --> 01:22:03,840
Let me up.

1891
01:22:05,580 --> 01:22:07,220
I gotta get up.

1892
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:10,560
Oh my god.

1893
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:11,340
There's so many.

1894
01:22:11,820 --> 01:22:13,160
So many shoes.

1895
01:22:15,560 --> 01:22:16,160
Please.

1896
01:22:16,180 --> 01:22:16,780
No.

1897
01:22:18,060 --> 01:22:18,660
Please.

1898
01:22:20,860 --> 01:22:21,460
Yeah.

1899
01:22:22,440 --> 01:22:23,240
That's right.

1900
01:22:23,540 --> 01:22:24,420
That's right.

1901
01:22:24,580 --> 01:22:24,920
Yeah.

1902
01:22:25,500 --> 01:22:26,320
I can't.

1903
01:22:27,880 --> 01:22:28,480
Yeah.

1904
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:29,600
That's what you're gonna do.

1905
01:22:29,920 --> 01:22:30,180
Huh?

1906
01:22:30,520 --> 01:22:31,120
Okay.

1907
01:22:31,240 --> 01:22:32,280
Where do I go though?

1908
01:22:35,460 --> 01:22:36,320
What the fuck?

1909
01:22:40,020 --> 01:22:40,860
Oh shit.

1910
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:42,380
We're 75%.

1911
01:22:43,380 --> 01:22:44,220
Holy shit.

1912
01:22:44,360 --> 01:22:44,720
Okay.

1913
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:46,820
Alright.

1914
01:22:46,820 --> 01:22:47,240
Okay.

1915
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:48,020
I got this.

1916
01:22:48,040 --> 01:22:48,780
I'm sprinting.

1917
01:22:49,380 --> 01:22:49,800
Boom.

1918
01:22:51,900 --> 01:22:52,320
Please.

1919
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:52,740
Please.

1920
01:22:53,060 --> 01:22:53,480
Please.

1921
01:22:53,480 --> 01:22:53,780
Please.

1922
01:22:53,940 --> 01:22:54,360
Please.

1923
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:55,420
No.

1924
01:22:55,520 --> 01:22:55,660
No.

1925
01:22:55,680 --> 01:22:55,780
No.

1926
01:22:55,780 --> 01:22:55,900
No.

1927
01:22:55,900 --> 01:22:56,140
No.

1928
01:22:56,140 --> 01:22:56,400
Yeah.

1929
01:22:56,620 --> 01:22:57,140
That's right.

1930
01:22:57,160 --> 01:22:58,080
You little bitch.

1931
01:23:00,820 --> 01:23:02,180
You little bitch.

1932
01:23:02,220 --> 01:23:02,860
What are you gonna do?

1933
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:03,300
Huh?

1934
01:23:04,840 --> 01:23:06,080
I thought I was gonna fall off.

1935
01:23:06,200 --> 01:23:07,320
I honestly thought.

1936
01:23:11,860 --> 01:23:12,960
What do I want?

1937
01:23:13,420 --> 01:23:14,480
What do I want?

1938
01:23:16,300 --> 01:23:17,980
Well you can't do a thing!

1939
01:23:18,260 --> 01:23:18,420
Oh!

1940
01:23:18,520 --> 01:23:18,780
Oh!

1941
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:19,620
What the...

1942
01:23:25,480 --> 01:23:27,360
I like it the fuck!

1943
01:23:29,340 --> 01:23:29,900
Please!

1944
01:23:36,280 --> 01:23:36,560
No!

1945
01:23:36,820 --> 01:23:37,280
Why?

1946
01:23:38,520 --> 01:23:39,080
Why?

1947
01:23:43,090 --> 01:23:43,570
Why?

1948
01:23:43,970 --> 01:23:45,190
I was through!

1949
01:23:46,590 --> 01:23:47,730
I got through!

1950
01:23:53,470 --> 01:23:55,190
It was cheap, guys!

1951
01:23:58,230 --> 01:23:59,770
I have to do it again!

1952
01:24:00,630 --> 01:24:02,430
I have to do it again!

1953
01:24:03,230 --> 01:24:04,990
Okay, I know what's gonna happen this time.

1954
01:24:05,930 --> 01:24:06,710
Yeah, slide.

1955
01:24:07,570 --> 01:24:08,390
I'm sliding.

1956
01:24:09,010 --> 01:24:10,610
Yeah, you can't get me this time.

1957
01:24:10,850 --> 01:24:12,270
You can't get me this time.

1958
01:24:12,310 --> 01:24:12,610
Please.

1959
01:24:12,930 --> 01:24:13,230
Please.

1960
01:24:13,250 --> 01:24:13,570
Please.

1961
01:24:15,850 --> 01:24:16,290
Yeah!

1962
01:24:16,570 --> 01:24:17,670
You can't get me!

1963
01:24:18,090 --> 01:24:18,530
Wait.

1964
01:24:18,630 --> 01:24:18,970
Wait.

1965
01:24:19,070 --> 01:24:19,370
Wait.

1966
01:24:19,450 --> 01:24:20,130
How do I do...

1967
01:24:20,130 --> 01:24:20,870
Wait!

1968
01:24:20,950 --> 01:24:22,330
I don't have anything to close this!

1969
01:24:22,670 --> 01:24:23,110
Wait!

1970
01:24:25,630 --> 01:24:26,070
Please.

1971
01:24:26,230 --> 01:24:26,750
He doesn't know.

1972
01:24:26,830 --> 01:24:27,490
He doesn't know!

1973
01:24:27,690 --> 01:24:28,670
He doesn't know!

1974
01:24:28,830 --> 01:24:29,070
No!

1975
01:24:29,190 --> 01:24:29,890
He doesn't know!

1976
01:24:30,210 --> 01:24:30,770
He doesn't...

1977
01:24:32,530 --> 01:24:33,270
He doesn't...

1978
01:24:33,270 --> 01:24:33,950
Wait, did he got me?

1979
01:24:34,690 --> 01:24:35,550
Did he got me?

1980
01:24:35,790 --> 01:24:36,390
Oh, he did!

1981
01:24:36,490 --> 01:24:36,970
He did!

1982
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:45,300
He did!

1983
01:24:45,300 --> 01:24:46,060
I'm got you!

1984
01:24:46,060 --> 01:24:46,240
He's gonna knock you down!

1985
01:24:46,260 --> 01:24:48,360
And you may come to tarnish it.

1986
01:24:50,280 --> 01:24:50,920
Okay, okay.

1987
01:24:51,020 --> 01:24:51,760
We got this again.

1988
01:24:51,940 --> 01:24:52,420
We got...

1989
01:24:53,040 --> 01:24:53,680
Okay, okay.

1990
01:24:54,040 --> 01:24:54,440
Boom!

1991
01:24:57,020 --> 01:24:58,140
It can't get me.

1992
01:24:58,160 --> 01:24:59,340
I'm fast as fuck, boy.

1993
01:25:00,240 --> 01:25:00,760
That's right.

1994
01:25:00,780 --> 01:25:01,780
You can't scare me again.

1995
01:25:02,440 --> 01:25:03,440
You can't scare me.

1996
01:25:03,480 --> 01:25:03,800
Please.

1997
01:25:03,920 --> 01:25:04,600
Please, don't touch me.

1998
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:07,040
Please, please, please, please, please, please, don't touch me.

1999
01:25:08,080 --> 01:25:08,640
I know.

2000
01:25:08,700 --> 01:25:09,100
I know what to do.

2001
01:25:09,120 --> 01:25:09,720
I know what to do now.

2002
01:25:10,060 --> 01:25:10,460
Hold.

2003
01:25:10,720 --> 01:25:11,120
Yeah!

2004
01:25:11,380 --> 01:25:12,340
I'm in the box.

2005
01:25:12,340 --> 01:25:12,460
I'm in a box.

2006
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:13,700
Can't get me.

2007
01:25:13,860 --> 01:25:14,960
I'm in a box.

2008
01:25:16,050 --> 01:25:17,000
I'm sorry.

2009
01:25:20,380 --> 01:25:23,260
I got stupid.

2010
01:25:28,280 --> 01:25:30,520
Can't see me.

2011
01:25:32,840 --> 01:25:33,820
Stupid.

2012
01:25:38,430 --> 01:25:39,970
Oh my god.

2013
01:25:43,710 --> 01:25:44,530
Yeah, that's right.

2014
01:25:44,590 --> 01:25:45,390
Fuck that gnome.

2015
01:25:45,950 --> 01:25:46,610
That's right.

2016
01:25:51,280 --> 01:25:52,040
I'm safe.

2017
01:25:56,440 --> 01:25:58,240
What did I join into?

2018
01:25:58,360 --> 01:25:59,420
What the fuck is that?

2019
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:00,700
Snake battle.

2020
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:07,740
I think we have like a clips channel.

2021
01:26:08,020 --> 01:26:08,880
I'm pretty sure.

2022
01:26:09,280 --> 01:26:11,080
We have a clips channel here.

2023
01:26:13,340 --> 01:26:14,660
Where am I?

2024
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:21,000
Do I need to throw this again?

2025
01:26:22,020 --> 01:26:22,540
Uh.

2026
01:26:27,450 --> 01:26:28,070
The fuck?

2027
01:26:35,290 --> 01:26:37,050
Oh my god, Dylan.

2028
01:26:37,590 --> 01:26:39,010
Thank you so much.

2029
01:26:42,630 --> 01:26:45,810
Dylan, thank you so much for the tier 1 7 months.

2030
01:26:46,130 --> 01:26:46,450
Woo.

2031
01:26:46,730 --> 01:26:49,030
Can we get some break nights real quick for Dylan?

2032
01:26:49,390 --> 01:26:50,710
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

2033
01:26:52,090 --> 01:26:53,770
How goes the stream so far?

2034
01:26:53,790 --> 01:26:55,270
Dude, we're fucking speed running it.

2035
01:26:55,390 --> 01:26:57,570
We've only been playing this game for like 20 minutes.

2036
01:26:57,850 --> 01:26:58,790
And we're almost done.

2037
01:26:59,050 --> 01:26:59,750
Isn't that crazy?

2038
01:27:00,330 --> 01:27:02,150
I have no idea what I'm doing right now.

2039
01:27:02,210 --> 01:27:03,150
I'm just pushing this box.

2040
01:27:07,190 --> 01:27:11,230
Yeah, I haven't died once or screamed at all.

2041
01:27:12,610 --> 01:27:13,770
Wait, do I just push this?

2042
01:27:15,730 --> 01:27:16,170
Push.

2043
01:27:16,990 --> 01:27:17,770
I don't...

2044
01:27:23,170 --> 01:27:23,610
What?

2045
01:27:24,810 --> 01:27:25,510
What do I do?

2046
01:27:26,130 --> 01:27:26,570
What?

2047
01:27:29,950 --> 01:27:30,950
What the fuck?

2048
01:27:31,570 --> 01:27:31,950
What the fuck?

2049
01:27:33,030 --> 01:27:34,570
Hey, Chris, the 11 man.

2050
01:27:37,790 --> 01:27:38,270
Push.

2051
01:27:40,170 --> 01:27:42,450
Wouldn't probably as well let that one slide.

2052
01:27:43,650 --> 01:27:44,710
Oh shit, here?

2053
01:27:45,410 --> 01:27:45,890
Jump?

2054
01:27:46,890 --> 01:27:47,370
No.

2055
01:27:50,970 --> 01:27:51,930
Alright, alright.

2056
01:27:52,030 --> 01:27:53,150
I'm trying to figure this shit out.

2057
01:27:53,530 --> 01:27:55,490
I'm using my brain here.

2058
01:27:58,950 --> 01:28:00,430
My brain is expanding.

2059
01:28:01,950 --> 01:28:03,230
It has to be down.

2060
01:28:03,350 --> 01:28:04,550
It is down.

2061
01:28:04,790 --> 01:28:05,750
How do I get in you?

2062
01:28:06,090 --> 01:28:06,450
Oh!

2063
01:28:06,810 --> 01:28:07,470
Oh!

2064
01:28:12,310 --> 01:28:16,870
I sent a screenshot on your Discord and I blame you for...

2065
01:28:16,870 --> 01:28:20,230
for... for... for reading testosterone.

2066
01:28:20,630 --> 01:28:21,650
What do I do?

2067
01:28:22,210 --> 01:28:23,250
Get down.

2068
01:28:23,730 --> 01:28:24,410
Oh!

2069
01:28:24,530 --> 01:28:24,930
Oh.

2070
01:28:26,990 --> 01:28:28,190
I'm so smart.

2071
01:28:31,890 --> 01:28:32,570
Oh?

2072
01:28:32,570 --> 01:28:33,810
Oh, here we go.

2073
01:28:36,490 --> 01:28:37,710
Oh shit, look at that.

2074
01:28:38,550 --> 01:28:39,430
What is he doing?

2075
01:28:40,290 --> 01:28:41,170
What is he doing?

2076
01:28:41,850 --> 01:28:43,910
Chris the 11 man, thank you so much for the follow.

2077
01:28:44,190 --> 01:28:45,290
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

2078
01:28:45,370 --> 01:28:46,070
Have a butt heart.

2079
01:28:46,170 --> 01:28:47,030
Thank you so much.

2080
01:28:47,410 --> 01:28:49,230
What does she do with them brain cells, right?

2081
01:28:50,350 --> 01:28:51,210
Can I just leave?

2082
01:28:51,630 --> 01:28:52,450
I don't wanna go.

2083
01:28:56,740 --> 01:28:57,100
Stupid.

2084
01:29:02,580 --> 01:29:03,840
Oh, he's so creepy.

2085
01:29:06,480 --> 01:29:07,600
He-he-he.

2086
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:11,560
Okay, I'm gonna lose this fucking spoon.

2087
01:29:12,360 --> 01:29:13,220
It's gonna leave.

2088
01:29:15,240 --> 01:29:16,060
Can I leave?

2089
01:29:19,160 --> 01:29:20,460
Oh, look, there's a dog.

2090
01:29:22,200 --> 01:29:22,660
Oh.

2091
01:29:28,220 --> 01:29:29,100
Is he gone?

2092
01:29:29,780 --> 01:29:30,580
Oh, he's gone.

2093
01:29:31,340 --> 01:29:32,380
What the fuck do I do?

2094
01:29:32,960 --> 01:29:33,420
Okay.

2095
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:38,540
We've been downloading a few months, basically flipping for a lot of time.

2096
01:29:38,780 --> 01:29:39,240
I'm gonna go home now.

2097
01:29:39,240 --> 01:29:40,360
And Stacey, you know what?

2098
01:29:40,440 --> 01:29:41,840
I'll finish downloading now.

2099
01:29:45,100 --> 01:29:45,460
Okay.

2100
01:29:46,280 --> 01:29:47,100
What the fuck is that?

2101
01:29:47,120 --> 01:29:49,080
It looks like a Freddy Krueger's blind cousin.

2102
01:29:49,180 --> 01:29:49,800
He doesn't have hair.

2103
01:29:50,260 --> 01:29:51,720
He wears a hat because he's bald.

2104
01:29:56,370 --> 01:29:57,930
Does he just want me to climb up?

2105
01:29:58,950 --> 01:30:00,010
I'm not climbing up!

2106
01:30:01,710 --> 01:30:02,810
Dude, what the fuck?

2107
01:30:05,370 --> 01:30:06,410
Am I supposed to wait?

2108
01:30:07,130 --> 01:30:07,870
Oh, fuck it.

2109
01:30:08,490 --> 01:30:09,150
What's he gonna do?

2110
01:30:09,190 --> 01:30:09,550
Kill me?

2111
01:30:11,430 --> 01:30:12,770
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

2112
01:30:13,550 --> 01:30:14,690
We have to go down, down!

2113
01:30:23,150 --> 01:30:24,070
I heard that.

2114
01:30:24,150 --> 01:30:25,150
I was like, I'm going back down.

2115
01:30:27,690 --> 01:30:28,570
Wait, he doesn't play?

2116
01:30:31,670 --> 01:30:33,110
Wait, wait, where am I supposed to go?

2117
01:30:35,270 --> 01:30:35,850
Okay, okay.

2118
01:30:35,890 --> 01:30:37,430
We're gonna let him kill me.

2119
01:30:37,490 --> 01:30:38,270
Kill me first.

2120
01:30:38,870 --> 01:30:41,210
Because I have no idea what I just do.

2121
01:30:41,570 --> 01:30:42,790
Yeah, come back here.

2122
01:30:45,490 --> 01:30:46,510
Stupid!

2123
01:30:54,490 --> 01:30:55,510
Okay.

2124
01:30:57,990 --> 01:30:59,750
Am I supposed to sneak?

2125
01:30:59,990 --> 01:31:00,670
Just...

2126
01:31:02,190 --> 01:31:03,210
go...

2127
01:31:05,120 --> 01:31:06,570
sneak through...

2128
01:31:07,860 --> 01:31:08,370
Whoa!

2129
01:31:11,120 --> 01:31:11,630
Just...

2130
01:31:19,660 --> 01:31:20,300
Go!

2131
01:31:20,640 --> 01:31:20,920
What?

2132
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:21,260
Wait!

2133
01:31:21,380 --> 01:31:21,820
No!

2134
01:31:21,960 --> 01:31:22,220
No!

2135
01:31:22,220 --> 01:31:23,000
You're not stupid!

2136
01:31:23,260 --> 01:31:24,060
You're not stupid!

2137
01:31:24,380 --> 01:31:25,420
You're not stupid!

2138
01:31:37,020 --> 01:31:38,020
I'm sorry.

2139
01:31:38,440 --> 01:31:39,540
I'm sorry.

2140
01:31:40,680 --> 01:31:41,480
I'm sorry.

2141
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:44,140
What the fuck is that?

2142
01:31:46,920 --> 01:31:49,060
I'm sorry for calling you stupid.

2143
01:31:53,940 --> 01:31:55,500
I don't know where to go.

2144
01:31:56,500 --> 01:31:57,040
Oh,

2145
01:32:08,260 --> 01:32:09,060
he doesn't know.

2146
01:32:09,140 --> 01:32:10,100
He doesn't know.

2147
01:32:10,120 --> 01:32:10,900
He doesn't know.

2148
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:11,480
He doesn't know!

2149
01:32:12,700 --> 01:32:14,360
Okay, maybe he knows.

2150
01:32:15,030 --> 01:32:15,940
Where do I go?

2151
01:32:17,240 --> 01:32:18,680
No, she didn't.

2152
01:32:18,680 --> 01:32:19,760
He might know.

2153
01:32:19,900 --> 01:32:22,440
Doesn't say anything else to say about it.

2154
01:32:24,060 --> 01:32:26,580
I'm trying to fucking figure out where to go.

2155
01:32:26,580 --> 01:32:28,780
I don't know where to go after.

2156
01:32:32,100 --> 01:32:33,780
Where the fuck do I go?

2157
01:32:36,640 --> 01:32:37,740
What the fuck?

2158
01:32:43,350 --> 01:32:44,950
I accidentally called him stupid.

2159
01:32:45,090 --> 01:32:45,770
Now he's mad.

2160
01:32:47,030 --> 01:32:47,790
Okay, okay.

2161
01:32:47,970 --> 01:32:48,650
Where do I go?

2162
01:32:49,750 --> 01:32:50,730
Where do I go?

2163
01:32:54,370 --> 01:32:55,590
She doesn't know.

2164
01:32:55,690 --> 01:32:56,530
I don't know.

2165
01:33:01,030 --> 01:33:01,670
No!

2166
01:33:05,090 --> 01:33:05,730
Please!

2167
01:33:05,730 --> 01:33:06,370
Stop!

2168
01:33:07,350 --> 01:33:07,710
No!

2169
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:14,720
I don't know!

2170
01:33:15,800 --> 01:33:18,080
I thought I'd jump in slow-mo.

2171
01:33:18,600 --> 01:33:20,220
I don't know where to go!

2172
01:33:24,900 --> 01:33:25,540
Alright.

2173
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:27,440
Okay, maybe I'll work one...

2174
01:33:28,780 --> 01:33:29,100
Please!

2175
01:33:35,920 --> 01:33:37,140
I'll work one day!

2176
01:33:37,560 --> 01:33:39,260
I'll get out of this hell!

2177
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:43,860
Believe in me!

2178
01:33:46,180 --> 01:33:46,540
Okay.

2179
01:33:56,030 --> 01:33:56,390
Alright.

2180
01:33:56,550 --> 01:33:57,310
Do I go like this?

2181
01:33:58,510 --> 01:33:58,870
Ugh!

2182
01:34:09,870 --> 01:34:10,510
What do I do?

2183
01:34:10,590 --> 01:34:11,390
What do I do with you?

2184
01:34:11,490 --> 01:34:12,330
What do I do with you?

2185
01:34:12,450 --> 01:34:13,010
Oh, he doesn't know.

2186
01:34:13,090 --> 01:34:13,650
He doesn't know.

2187
01:34:13,930 --> 01:34:14,930
Okay, he knows.

2188
01:34:18,750 --> 01:34:20,310
Okay, I think he knew.

2189
01:34:22,050 --> 01:34:23,830
I thought I could camouflage!

2190
01:34:25,510 --> 01:34:27,090
There's so many of me!

2191
01:34:31,200 --> 01:34:32,500
What do I do?

2192
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:35,940
What the fuck do you want from me?

2193
01:34:36,660 --> 01:34:38,380
What do you want from me?

2194
01:34:45,020 --> 01:34:47,500
I've gotten so many things through work.

2195
01:34:50,340 --> 01:34:50,820
Okay.

2196
01:34:50,820 --> 01:34:50,940
Okay.

2197
01:34:51,540 --> 01:34:52,020
Okay.

2198
01:35:07,760 --> 01:35:08,240
Please.

2199
01:35:08,460 --> 01:35:08,980
Let me climb.

2200
01:35:09,140 --> 01:35:09,360
This.

2201
01:35:09,480 --> 01:35:09,940
Let me climb.

2202
01:35:10,100 --> 01:35:10,520
Let me climb!

2203
01:35:10,620 --> 01:35:11,040
Let me climb!

2204
01:35:11,160 --> 01:35:11,420
No!

2205
01:35:15,950 --> 01:35:16,430
Please!

2206
01:35:16,450 --> 01:35:17,510
Let me climb!

2207
01:35:18,450 --> 01:35:20,170
One day, let me climb!

2208
01:35:23,270 --> 01:35:23,750
Please!

2209
01:35:23,750 --> 01:35:25,110
I just wanna climb!

2210
01:35:25,870 --> 01:35:26,350
Okay.

2211
01:35:29,190 --> 01:35:30,190
I got this.

2212
01:35:30,190 --> 01:35:31,830
I got this!

2213
01:35:32,970 --> 01:35:34,250
And we're getting closer!

2214
01:35:34,690 --> 01:35:35,650
We're getting closer!

2215
01:35:39,170 --> 01:35:42,050
Okay, maybe I just need to throw the monkey farther away.

2216
01:35:42,910 --> 01:35:43,450
That's it.

2217
01:35:43,610 --> 01:35:45,010
The monkey just needs to be farther.

2218
01:35:46,130 --> 01:35:49,950
I just need to throw this monkey farther away.

2219
01:35:50,930 --> 01:35:51,410
Ugh!

2220
01:35:52,150 --> 01:35:52,870
Here we go.

2221
01:35:55,370 --> 01:35:55,850
Yeah...

2222
01:36:00,370 --> 01:36:00,850
Wait!

2223
01:36:00,910 --> 01:36:01,530
What the fuck?!

2224
01:36:01,530 --> 01:36:02,650
Why are you so fast?!

2225
01:36:06,090 --> 01:36:08,250
Why are you so fast?!

2226
01:36:12,270 --> 01:36:13,610
He heard me?!

2227
01:36:13,610 --> 01:36:14,870
Holy shit!

2228
01:36:15,010 --> 01:36:15,510
Come on!

2229
01:36:15,950 --> 01:36:17,210
You don't even have ears!

2230
01:36:17,890 --> 01:36:19,010
You don't even have...

2231
01:36:19,010 --> 01:36:19,490
Okay, maybe.

2232
01:36:19,670 --> 01:36:20,830
Okay, you do because you can hear...

2233
01:36:20,830 --> 01:36:21,210
Oh, you do.

2234
01:36:21,230 --> 01:36:22,630
You actually do have ears.

2235
01:36:23,890 --> 01:36:25,430
He does have ears.

2236
01:36:28,150 --> 01:36:28,630
Okay.

2237
01:36:29,070 --> 01:36:30,630
It'll work some day.

2238
01:36:34,760 --> 01:36:35,240
Okay.

2239
01:36:35,440 --> 01:36:35,880
Okay.

2240
01:36:36,440 --> 01:36:37,800
We just need to keep trying.

2241
01:36:37,920 --> 01:36:38,240
I...

2242
01:36:38,240 --> 01:36:38,400
I just...

2243
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:39,640
We know what to do.

2244
01:36:39,800 --> 01:36:41,060
You hurt the monkey?

2245
01:36:42,200 --> 01:36:42,800
Monkey!

2246
01:36:47,400 --> 01:36:48,520
Go for the monkey!

2247
01:36:49,180 --> 01:36:50,520
Is the monkey too far?

2248
01:36:51,820 --> 01:36:54,520
Monkey too far...

2249
01:36:59,110 --> 01:37:00,470
Here we go.

2250
01:37:02,190 --> 01:37:02,790
Monkey!

2251
01:37:05,130 --> 01:37:05,730

Please, please, please.

2258
01:37:44,460 --> 01:37:45,800
No, you don't know where I am.

You don't know where I am!

2260
01:37:46,760 --> 01:37:47,460
You don't know where I am!

2261
01:37:50,140 --> 01:37:52,480
I just wanna... I just wanna climb!

2262

2263
01:37:56,660 --> 01:37:58,140
Please, just let me climb.

2264
01:38:02,860 --> 01:38:04,220

2266
01:38:09,800 --> 01:38:11,620
I hate you so much.

2267
01:38:13,460 --> 01:38:14,600
Okay, there are two monkeys.

2268
01:38:14,840 --> 01:38:15,240
Okay.

2269
01:38:16,060 --> 01:38:17,160
Okay, I got this.

2270
01:38:18,060 --> 01:38:19,260
I'll figure this out.

2271
01:38:19,380 --> 01:38:20,340
I'm fucking so smart.

2272
01:38:20,420 --> 01:38:21,320
I'll figure this out.

2273
01:38:21,580 --> 01:38:22,040
Bam!

2274
01:38:26,040 --> 01:38:27,280
I'm gonna figure it out.

2275
01:38:28,040 --> 01:38:30,200
Mark my words, I'm gonna figure you out.

2276
01:38:34,060 --> 01:38:34,960
Is this a monkey?

2277
01:38:39,540 --> 01:38:40,740
Please, let me climb.

2278
01:38:41,840 --> 01:38:42,780
That's all I need to do!

That's all I need to do!

2280
01:38:43,820 --> 01:38:44,680
That's all I need to do!

2281
01:38:44,860 --> 01:38:46,160
I just need to do two monkeys!

2282
01:38:46,420 --> 01:38:47,080
Two monkeys!

2283
01:38:51,560 --> 01:38:52,900
Please, please let me through.

2284
01:38:54,940 --> 01:38:55,740
Two monkeys.

2285
01:38:57,500 --> 01:38:58,460
It's so easy.

2286
01:38:58,520 --> 01:38:59,100
First try.

2287
01:39:01,700 --> 01:39:03,500
I didn't think that would work.

2288
01:39:04,880 --> 01:39:05,280
Boom.

2289
01:39:06,080 --> 01:39:07,140
God, I'm so smart.

2290
01:39:07,780 --> 01:39:08,580
Two monkeys.

2291
01:39:12,460 --> 01:39:13,300
Wait, wait.

2292
01:39:13,360 --> 01:39:13,940
Who are you?

2293
01:39:13,940 --> 01:39:14,420
Wait!

2294
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:16,240
How did you get here?

2295
01:39:17,920 --> 01:39:19,080
What did you do here?

2296
01:39:31,040 --> 01:39:32,520
First try every time.

2297
01:39:32,920 --> 01:39:34,080
Oh, oh, oh!

2298
01:39:34,120 --> 01:39:34,480
What?

2299
01:39:34,820 --> 01:39:35,320
What?

2300
01:39:39,510 --> 01:39:40,010
What?

2301
01:39:42,150 --> 01:39:42,830
Take that!

2302
01:39:43,030 --> 01:39:43,530
No!

2303
01:39:43,730 --> 01:39:44,290
Not me!

2304
01:39:44,470 --> 01:39:44,970
Not me!

2305
01:39:45,090 --> 01:39:45,490
Not me!

2306
01:39:47,690 --> 01:39:48,190
What?

2307
01:39:49,190 --> 01:39:49,690
Zero.

2308
01:39:49,870 --> 01:39:50,730
You haven't died yet.

2309
01:39:50,930 --> 01:39:51,910
We haven't died yet.

2310
01:39:52,110 --> 01:39:52,790
We were just...

2311
01:39:52,790 --> 01:39:53,770
This is brother.

2312
01:39:53,770 --> 01:39:53,930
This is brother.

2313
01:39:57,680 --> 01:39:58,920
What do I do here?

2314
01:40:01,480 --> 01:40:03,280
Do I- Is this?

2315
01:40:03,760 --> 01:40:04,460
What is this?

2316
01:40:09,530 --> 01:40:10,910
Can I climb up this?

2317
01:40:11,450 --> 01:40:11,930
No.

2318
01:40:14,490 --> 01:40:14,970
Ok.

2319
01:40:14,990 --> 01:40:16,630
I need to like, figure out what this is.

2320
01:40:17,070 --> 01:40:17,910
What is this?

2321
01:40:18,750 --> 01:40:19,950
What is this?

2322
01:40:22,610 --> 01:40:23,490
What is this?

2323
01:40:23,730 --> 01:40:24,270
What is this?

2324
01:40:24,270 --> 01:40:24,530
What are you?

2325
01:40:25,310 --> 01:40:26,310
I'm so confused.

2326
01:40:27,510 --> 01:40:28,570
Did I push this?

2327
01:40:29,430 --> 01:40:30,170
What are you?

2328
01:40:30,650 --> 01:40:31,230
What the?

2329
01:40:31,250 --> 01:40:31,450
Ah!

2330
01:40:34,190 --> 01:40:34,950
It's easy!

2331
01:40:36,070 --> 01:40:37,210
Just don't die.

2332
01:40:37,270 --> 01:40:38,230
Oh shit, you're right.

2333
01:40:38,530 --> 01:40:39,250
You're right.

2334
01:40:40,170 --> 01:40:40,650
Okay.

2335
01:40:42,410 --> 01:40:45,750
I do this, and then I go WOOOOOOAH!

2336
01:40:49,680 --> 01:40:50,640
And then...

2337
01:40:51,420 --> 01:40:52,380
And then...

2338
01:40:52,920 --> 01:40:53,580
I don't know.

2339
01:40:53,900 --> 01:40:55,920
I don't know what to do after this part.

2340
01:40:56,200 --> 01:40:57,080
He doesn't know.

2341
01:40:57,380 --> 01:40:58,280
I'm in the dark.

2342
01:40:58,440 --> 01:40:59,600
He don't know where I am.

2343
01:40:59,720 --> 01:41:00,360
I'm in the dark!

2344
01:41:02,560 --> 01:41:04,840
Do we not just go... Maybe go forward.

2345
01:41:05,340 --> 01:41:06,900
Maybe I don't go backwards.

2346
01:41:07,900 --> 01:41:09,480
Maybe I just go forward.

2347
01:41:09,980 --> 01:41:12,100
Like a like a normal person.

2348
01:41:14,260 --> 01:41:16,320
Maybe I don't run in a dead end.

2349
01:41:17,840 --> 01:41:20,400
I feel like maybe I should just went forward.

2350
01:41:23,240 --> 01:41:23,760
Okay.

2351
01:41:24,740 --> 01:41:25,260
Okay.

2352
01:41:25,320 --> 01:41:25,760
Oh.

2353
01:41:27,500 --> 01:41:28,020
No.

2354
01:41:29,120 --> 01:41:29,700
That wasn't it.

2355
01:41:29,760 --> 01:41:30,480
That wasn't it.

2356
01:41:34,500 --> 01:41:36,080
That wasn't it.

2357
01:41:36,080 --> 01:41:37,100
That wasn't it.

2358
01:41:37,380 --> 01:41:39,100
Forward was not the answer.

2359
01:41:39,920 --> 01:41:41,600
Forward was not the answer.

2360
01:41:42,700 --> 01:41:43,980
I'm so wet.

2361
01:41:44,740 --> 01:41:49,060
I had to do a hard clicking puzzle and now you want me to do another hard puzzle?

2362
01:41:49,380 --> 01:41:50,480
Back to back?

2363
01:41:50,820 --> 01:41:52,300
What is wrong with you?

2364
01:41:52,880 --> 01:41:54,760
I need to recharge my brain.

2365
01:41:56,740 --> 01:41:57,300
Okay.

2366
01:41:57,400 --> 01:41:57,680
Maybe.

2367
01:41:58,100 --> 01:41:58,660
Maybe.

2368
01:41:59,840 --> 01:42:02,100
Maybe I take the shoe and I throw the shoe.

2369
01:42:02,460 --> 01:42:03,340
Give me your shoe.

2370
01:42:03,440 --> 01:42:04,200
Give me your shoe.

2371
01:42:04,320 --> 01:42:05,560
Give me the shoe.

2372
01:42:05,780 --> 01:42:06,140
No!

2373
01:42:06,360 --> 01:42:08,300
Let me throw this first.

2374
01:42:08,660 --> 01:42:08,900
Let me.

2375
01:42:09,900 --> 01:42:10,380

But it's not as spooky.

2398

2399
01:42:46,620 --> 01:42:48,840

Big brain and spooky game.

01:43:13,260 --> 01:43:14,340
And then... Okay.

2421
01:43:14,460 --> 01:43:15,540
I push this door.

2422
01:43:16,180 --> 01:43:16,580
And...

2423
01:43:16,580 --> 01:43:18,440

And I am like...

2427
01:43:22,260 --> 01:43:23,020

01:43:23,020 --> 01:43:23,400
What?

2429
01:43:23,520 --> 01:43:23,780
No!

2430
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:27,420
Okay.

2431
01:43:27,420 --> 01:43:30,160
Usually... Usually it doesn't pick me up that fast.

2432
01:43:31,200 --> 01:43:34,120
Usually I have a few times to process him.

2433
01:43:34,480 --> 01:43:34,900
Okay.

2434
01:43:38,220 --> 01:43:38,640
So...

01:43:38,640 --> 01:43:41,180

2474
01:44:44,620 --> 01:44:45,460
I need to pick up the shoe.

2475
01:44:45,740 --> 01:44:46,480

2476
01:44:46,900 --> 01:44:48,640

Oh my god.

2488
01:45:00,400 --> 01:45:01,060
Is the shoe too big?

2489
01:45:01,260 --> 01:45:02,260
Is the shoe too big?

2490
01:45:02,320 --> 01:45:03,200
The shoe is too big.

2491
01:45:06,420 --> 01:45:06,820
Please.

2492
01:45:08,680 --> 01:45:10,000
I picked the wrong shoe.

2493
01:45:10,180 --> 01:45:11,080
I picked the wrong shoe.

2494
01:45:11,160 --> 01:45:11,460
I am sorry.

2495
01:45:11,740 --> 01:45:12,440

We got this.

2500
01:45:19,420 --> 01:45:20,700
I am leaving.

2501
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:21,020

2502
01:45:22,260 --> 01:45:22,660
Goodbye.

01:45:25,800 --> 01:45:26,200
Yeah.

2504
01:45:26,480 --> 01:45:27,800
I can't catch you now.

2505
01:45:30,420 --> 01:45:30,820
Okay.

2506
01:45:30,900 --> 01:45:32,340
So the problem was that I picked...

2507
01:45:32,340 --> 01:45:33,320
I picked the wrong shoe.

2508
01:45:33,500 --> 01:45:34,320
But we are okay now.

2509
01:45:34,440 --> 01:45:35,260
We are okay now.

2510
01:45:36,600 --> 01:45:37,340
We are okay.

2511
01:45:37,460 --> 01:45:37,940
We are okay.

2512
01:45:38,400 --> 01:45:39,340
We are okay chat.

2513
01:45:41,400 --> 01:45:41,880
We are okay chat.

2514
01:45:41,880 --> 01:45:42,880
Well, I guess it's exactly...

2515
01:45:42,880 --> 01:45:43,240
Oh!

2516
01:45:43,340 --> 01:45:44,800
We were never stuck on it.

2517
01:45:44,880 --> 01:45:46,160
We were never stuck on it.

2518
01:45:46,640 --> 01:45:48,900
This was my first try playing this.

2519
01:45:49,100 --> 01:45:49,880
Doing that quiz.

2520
01:45:50,740 --> 01:45:51,220
Yeah.

2521
01:45:51,260 --> 01:45:51,640
Never.

2522
01:45:51,740 --> 01:45:52,220
Exactly.

2523
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:53,480
Never.

2524
01:45:53,940 --> 01:45:54,680
First try.

2525
01:45:55,360 --> 01:45:55,840
Hiram!

2526
01:45:56,860 --> 01:45:57,340
Okay.

2527
01:45:57,500 --> 01:45:59,300
What the fuck is this piano doing here?

2528
01:46:02,040 --> 01:46:02,520
Okay.

2529
01:46:03,040 --> 01:46:03,520
Boom.

2530
01:46:04,060 --> 01:46:04,540
Oh.

2531
01:46:04,600 --> 01:46:04,960
Oh.

2532
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:05,340
I got it.

2533
01:46:05,580 --> 01:46:05,960
I got it.

2534
01:46:06,080 --> 01:46:06,560
I got it.

2535
01:46:06,700 --> 01:46:06,700
I got it.

2536
01:46:09,340 --> 01:46:10,160
I thought I tied there.

2537
01:46:10,620 --> 01:46:11,020
Okay.

2538
01:46:11,760 --> 01:46:12,660
Can I open this?

2539
01:46:13,220 --> 01:46:13,620
No.

2540
01:46:15,960 --> 01:46:16,360
Wait.

2541
01:46:16,360 --> 01:46:17,240
If I can just...

2542
01:46:17,240 --> 01:46:18,780
I can just climb on all of these, right?

2543
01:46:20,780 --> 01:46:21,180
Yeah.

2544
01:46:26,220 --> 01:46:27,640
Let me just climb on these.

2545
01:46:27,840 --> 01:46:28,240
Okay.

2546
01:46:28,300 --> 01:46:29,080
But what do I do after?

2547
01:46:32,900 --> 01:46:33,300
Oh.

2548
01:46:35,060 --> 01:46:35,460
Push?

2549
01:46:36,400 --> 01:46:36,800
No.

2550
01:46:37,320 --> 01:46:38,140
What the fuck?

2551
01:46:43,050 --> 01:46:43,450
Oh.

2552
01:46:43,570 --> 01:46:44,530
I can climb on this.

2553
01:46:45,890 --> 01:46:46,990
Just grow taller.

2554
01:46:47,130 --> 01:46:47,290
Shit.

2555
01:46:47,390 --> 01:46:47,770
You're right.

2556
01:46:48,170 --> 01:46:49,530
I can climb on this.

2557
01:46:49,830 --> 01:46:50,310
Wait.

2558
01:46:50,410 --> 01:46:50,770
There's a door.

2559
01:46:51,190 --> 01:46:51,710
Push?

2560
01:46:53,230 --> 01:46:53,750
No.

2561
01:46:54,510 --> 01:46:54,850
No.

2562
01:46:54,930 --> 01:46:55,070
No.

2563
01:46:55,070 --> 01:46:55,190
No.

2564
01:46:55,190 --> 01:46:55,710
Okay.

2565
01:46:56,090 --> 01:46:56,430
Climb.

2566
01:46:57,370 --> 01:46:58,590
Just grow taller.

2567
01:46:58,790 --> 01:46:59,130
Fuck.

2568
01:46:59,230 --> 01:46:59,670
You're right.

2569
01:47:00,170 --> 01:47:00,690
Oh.

2570
01:47:00,690 --> 01:47:00,870
I...

2571
01:47:02,710 --> 01:47:04,510
I can just climb this.

2572
01:47:05,110 --> 01:47:06,630
I can just climb this.

2573
01:47:07,830 --> 01:47:08,350
Okay.

2574
01:47:09,110 --> 01:47:09,630
Boom.

2575
01:47:09,630 --> 01:47:09,930
Boom.

2576
01:47:13,310 --> 01:47:13,730
Oh.

2577
01:47:15,270 --> 01:47:15,690
Oh.

2578
01:47:15,690 --> 01:47:16,110
Wait.

2579
01:47:16,190 --> 01:47:16,730
It's pulling me?

2580
01:47:17,550 --> 01:47:18,430
Am I getting pulled?

2581
01:47:18,590 --> 01:47:18,730
No.

2582
01:47:18,770 --> 01:47:19,750
I'm supposed to jump here.

2583
01:47:25,580 --> 01:47:26,580
I'm just gonna climb.

2584
01:47:27,620 --> 01:47:28,040
Oh.

2585
01:47:28,180 --> 01:47:28,420
Oh.

01:47:28,760 --> 01:47:28,980
Oh.

2588
01:47:31,580 --> 01:47:32,000
Stupid.

2589
01:47:43,770 --> 01:47:44,610
There's a...

2590
01:47:44,610 --> 01:47:45,170
Oh.

2591
01:47:54,240 --> 01:47:54,500

Whoa.

2620

Get your hands away from here.

2621
01:48:23,550 --> 01:48:27,770
Because I'm on a data and my powers out, but I hope I have nicer lights than you tonight.

2622
01:48:27,870 --> 01:48:28,270
Okay.

2623
01:48:28,350 --> 01:48:28,570

01:48:51,850 --> 01:48:57,610
Playing this game for the rest of the stream.

2632
01:48:59,650 --> 01:49:02,070
And then we're gonna play a new game tomorrow.

2633
01:49:02,070 --> 01:49:04,870
Cause I heard this was only 3 hours.

2634
01:49:05,670 --> 01:49:06,970
Or 4 hours max.

2635
01:49:08,810 --> 01:49:09,570
Have a monkey.

2636
01:49:10,670 --> 01:49:11,430
Have a monkey.

2637
01:49:22,070 --> 01:49:23,230
Wait, I got an idea.

2638
01:49:23,670 --> 01:49:24,550
I got an idea.

2639
01:49:24,810 --> 01:49:25,430
Oh, no wait, wait.

2640
01:49:25,550 --> 01:49:26,710
Let me back up, let me back up.

2641
01:49:26,770 --> 01:49:27,190
I have an idea.

2642
01:49:27,510 --> 01:49:29,290
I do this, and I go...

2643
01:49:31,470 --> 01:49:31,870
Ugh.

2644
01:49:34,790 --> 01:49:36,470
Yeah, you don't know where I am.

2645
01:49:38,130 --> 01:49:39,170
Oh, oh, wait!

2646
01:49:39,290 --> 01:49:39,310
Wait!

2647
01:49:40,470 --> 01:49:42,590
Yeah, you don't know where I am.

2648
01:49:42,710 --> 01:49:43,050
Stupid.

2649
01:49:46,570 --> 01:49:47,370
Wait, wait.

2650
01:49:47,410 --> 01:49:48,150
Please, please.

2651
01:49:48,290 --> 01:49:48,870
Let me through.

2652
01:49:49,010 --> 01:49:49,710
Let me through here.

2653
01:49:49,810 --> 01:49:50,130
No!

2654
01:49:51,670 --> 01:49:52,410
You stupid.

2655
01:49:56,130 --> 01:49:56,910
What do I do here?

2656
01:50:10,040 --> 01:50:11,260
How do I get out though?

2657
01:50:13,020 --> 01:50:13,420
What?

2658
01:50:14,040 --> 01:50:15,200
How do I get out of here?

2659
01:50:17,020 --> 01:50:18,700
How do I get out of here?

2660
01:50:24,220 --> 01:50:24,620
Wait.

2661
01:50:26,440 --> 01:50:27,460
I'm so confused.

2662
01:50:30,180 --> 01:50:31,300
What game were you thinking?

2663
01:50:31,360 --> 01:50:32,900
I'm thinking I'm playing Visage.

2664
01:50:35,100 --> 01:50:35,800
How do I...

2665
01:50:35,800 --> 01:50:36,780
What do I do with you?

2666
01:50:39,080 --> 01:50:39,480
What?

2667
01:50:41,740 --> 01:50:42,840
How do I get out?

2668
01:50:43,340 --> 01:50:44,120
Let me out!

2669
01:50:47,540 --> 01:50:49,740
Cause I was watching you run away from him.

2670
01:50:51,860 --> 01:50:54,000
I don't know how to get out, chat.

2671
01:50:54,320 --> 01:50:54,720
I don't know how to get out.

2672
01:50:54,720 --> 01:50:54,800
Chat.

2673
01:50:57,800 --> 01:50:58,200
Ugh.

2674
01:50:58,700 --> 01:50:59,620
Oh, there's a door.

2675
01:51:02,160 --> 01:51:03,340
Oh, I can't push it.

2676
01:51:03,380 --> 01:51:03,920
Never mind.

2677
01:51:04,200 --> 01:51:05,620
I thought I could get out.

2678
01:51:07,840 --> 01:51:08,240
Okay.

2679
01:51:08,380 --> 01:51:09,260
I got an idea.

2680
01:51:09,420 --> 01:51:09,860
I got...

2681
01:51:09,860 --> 01:51:10,340
Okay.

2682
01:51:10,400 --> 01:51:10,960
Not like that.

2683
01:51:11,500 --> 01:51:11,900
Okay.

2684
01:51:13,620 --> 01:51:14,860
Okay, so I have this.

2685
01:51:15,840 --> 01:51:17,440
But I don't know what to do with this.

2686
01:51:17,680 --> 01:51:18,340
Can I throw you?

2687
01:51:19,040 --> 01:51:20,540
I can't even throw you.

2688
01:51:20,860 --> 01:51:21,680
What the fuck?

2689
01:51:21,700 --> 01:51:22,300
What's the point?

2690
01:51:32,940 --> 01:51:34,140
Who the fuck would do that?

2691
01:51:34,160 --> 01:51:34,540
What?

2692
01:51:35,040 --> 01:51:37,340
Okay, wait, okay, okay, I'll figure this out.

2693
01:51:37,440 --> 01:51:38,120
I'll use musing.

2694
01:51:38,320 --> 01:51:39,560
Maybe make the guy open.

2695
01:51:39,680 --> 01:51:40,660
Oh shit, you're right!

2696
01:51:40,940 --> 01:51:42,320
You're so smart Rem!

2697
01:51:42,560 --> 01:51:43,960
You're so fucking smart!

2698
01:51:44,360 --> 01:51:45,680
Okay, where the fuck is this thing?

2699
01:51:45,820 --> 01:51:47,760
Okay, I'm gonna put this here.

2700
01:51:48,520 --> 01:51:49,560
I'm gonna put you here.

2701
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:54,660
And then... okay, Bunny will figure out like how we're to hide though afterwards.

2702
01:51:55,260 --> 01:51:58,860
Because I swear if they make me do this again afterwards...

2703
01:51:58,860 --> 01:52:01,000
Okay, where's a good hiding spot?

2704
01:52:02,040 --> 01:52:02,960
Should I hide here?

2705
01:52:03,420 --> 01:52:04,680
I should hide here, right?

2706
01:52:08,590 --> 01:52:10,410
Okay, maybe if I hide here... Oh!

2707
01:52:10,510 --> 01:52:10,970
Oh my god!

2708
01:52:11,030 --> 01:52:12,450
Thank you so much for the follow rock!

2709
01:52:12,750 --> 01:52:14,030
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

2710
01:52:14,310 --> 01:52:16,070
Have a... have a butt heart.

2711
01:52:16,190 --> 01:52:17,110
Thank you so much.

2712
01:52:17,230 --> 01:52:18,250
Okay, okay.

2713
01:52:19,050 --> 01:52:19,490
Alright.

2714
01:52:20,890 --> 01:52:21,830
What you gonna do?

2715
01:52:22,290 --> 01:52:23,270
What you gonna do?

2716
01:52:23,810 --> 01:52:24,250
Bam!

2717
01:52:28,930 --> 01:52:31,070
I thought I would make more noise.

2718
01:52:31,390 --> 01:52:32,350
I honestly...

2719
01:52:32,350 --> 01:52:34,330
thought this would make a lot more noise.

2720
01:52:34,650 --> 01:52:35,330
Come on.

2721
01:52:35,890 --> 01:52:36,810
Make some noise.

2722
01:52:37,250 --> 01:52:37,730
Huh?

2723
01:52:41,390 --> 01:52:42,330
Oh TV!

2724
01:52:43,530 --> 01:52:44,010
Oh!

2725
01:52:45,310 --> 01:52:46,790
Oh TV make noises!

2726
01:52:50,590 --> 01:52:51,470
Please, please.

2727
01:52:52,470 --> 01:52:54,030
Let me... let me... let me...

2728
01:52:55,330 --> 01:52:56,430
Let me hide.

2729
01:52:56,490 --> 01:52:57,210
Let me hide in here.

2730
01:52:57,610 --> 01:52:58,390
This is dope.

2731
01:52:58,450 --> 01:52:59,130
This is dope.

2732
01:53:01,710 --> 01:53:02,330
Open the door!

2733
01:53:02,330 --> 01:53:02,550
Open the door!

2734
01:53:02,930 --> 01:53:03,630
Open the door!

2735
01:53:07,230 --> 01:53:09,290
He doesn't know... he doesn't know.

2736
01:53:09,950 --> 01:53:10,810
He is stupid.

2737
01:53:11,470 --> 01:53:11,870
Fuck.

2738
01:53:17,560 --> 01:53:19,360
Aww, he wants a girlfriend.

2739
01:53:20,560 --> 01:53:22,280
He wants like... Oh, wait Ryan?

2740
01:53:22,540 --> 01:53:22,940
Oh.

2741
01:53:23,200 --> 01:53:23,600
Oh.

2742
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:24,400
Ah!

2743
01:53:25,360 --> 01:53:26,040
You liar!

2744
01:53:26,240 --> 01:53:26,720
You liar!

2745
01:53:26,880 --> 01:53:27,640
Why did you tell me to run?

2746
01:53:27,820 --> 01:53:28,720
Why did you tell me to run?

2747
01:53:28,940 --> 01:53:30,280
Why did you tell me to run??

2748
01:53:33,300 --> 01:53:33,700
Shzął alliance Wait!

2749
01:53:33,900 --> 01:53:34,500
Wait, wait, wait!

2750
01:53:34,500 --> 01:53:35,400
Wait, wait, you're right.

2751
01:53:35,400 --> 01:53:36,160
I should run!

2752
01:53:36,300 --> 01:53:37,060
I should run!

2753
01:53:44,110 --> 01:53:44,550
Please!

2754
01:53:44,750 --> 01:53:45,150
Please!

2755
01:53:45,350 --> 01:53:45,710
Please!

2756
01:53:47,850 --> 01:53:48,650
Let me through!

2757
01:53:55,570 --> 01:53:56,350
He doesn't know!

2758
01:53:56,390 --> 01:53:56,950
He doesn't know!

2759
01:53:57,350 --> 01:53:58,170
He doesn't know!

2760
01:54:00,650 --> 01:54:01,430
He didn't know.

2761
01:54:04,630 --> 01:54:06,490
I just wanted to ask how you laughed.

2762
01:54:06,710 --> 01:54:09,230
Oh, you're just a pro for letting people know when to run.

2763
01:54:13,730 --> 01:54:15,290
God, I'm so good at this game.

2764
01:54:16,990 --> 01:54:17,410
Please.

2765
01:54:17,410 --> 01:54:18,170
Oh, God!

2766
01:54:18,250 --> 01:54:19,450
I thought I was gonna make it.

2767
01:54:21,070 --> 01:54:21,490
Boom!

2768
01:54:21,490 --> 01:54:22,510
Look at that shit.

2769
01:54:22,690 --> 01:54:23,070
Please try.

2770
01:54:23,390 --> 01:54:24,050
Please try.

2771
01:54:25,610 --> 01:54:26,250
Please try.

2772
01:54:28,790 --> 01:54:29,210
Okay.

2773
01:54:33,630 --> 01:54:34,830
Okay, let me through.

2774
01:54:35,570 --> 01:54:36,570
Please, let me through.

2775
01:54:39,010 --> 01:54:39,990
Where am I?

2776
01:54:43,730 --> 01:54:45,690
We haven't hit the kitchen yet.

2777
01:54:46,310 --> 01:54:49,470
The kitchen is part of the fat boy, right?

2778
01:54:49,530 --> 01:54:50,350
The fat kitchen guy.

2779
01:54:51,370 --> 01:54:52,910
He's in this game, right?

2780
01:54:53,230 --> 01:54:55,630
I don't know if he's in this game or like...

2781
01:54:56,450 --> 01:54:59,410
Or like in the DLC because I've seen that guy a lot.

2782
01:55:03,920 --> 01:55:04,360
Open.

2783
01:55:05,520 --> 01:55:05,960
Open.

2784
01:55:06,900 --> 01:55:07,340
Open.

2785
01:55:09,720 --> 01:55:10,160
Open?

2786
01:55:12,920 --> 01:55:13,360
Oh!

2787
01:55:13,360 --> 01:55:14,140
I pushed!

2788
01:55:16,400 --> 01:55:17,580
I need to... Oh!

2789
01:55:17,600 --> 01:55:17,880
Oh!

2790
01:55:18,020 --> 01:55:18,400
What?

2791
01:55:20,380 --> 01:55:20,940
What?

2792
01:55:22,240 --> 01:55:24,120
I got past the first time.

2793
01:55:25,660 --> 01:55:27,580
How did I die there?

2794
01:55:28,700 --> 01:55:30,100
What the fuck?

2795
01:55:30,520 --> 01:55:32,640
Let me pass the first time.

2796
01:55:33,580 --> 01:55:36,040
Yeah, but I got past it the first time.

2797
01:55:36,340 --> 01:55:38,180
So, I thought I was okay.

2798
01:55:48,750 --> 01:55:49,310
Okay.

2799
01:55:50,190 --> 01:55:51,570
And then I go this?

2800
01:55:51,870 --> 01:55:52,210
What?

2801
01:55:52,210 --> 01:55:53,370
Boom!

2802
01:55:54,950 --> 01:55:56,770
Kare-chan is so smart.

2803
01:56:03,340 --> 01:56:04,520
And then...

2804
01:56:06,500 --> 01:56:07,760
And then...

2805
01:56:08,180 --> 01:56:09,000
Wait.

2806
01:56:11,140 --> 01:56:11,560
Oh!

2807
01:56:11,600 --> 01:56:17,840
What the f- What the f- How?

2808
01:56:19,640 --> 01:56:20,480
How?

2809
01:56:21,680 --> 01:56:23,020
How is that possible?

2810
01:56:23,020 --> 01:56:23,640
What's the f-

2811
01:56:27,060 --> 01:56:31,400
What the f- Oh my god.

2812
01:56:32,480 --> 01:56:34,020
What happened to the room?

2813
01:56:34,280 --> 01:56:35,880
So what's your favorite...

2814
01:56:36,500 --> 01:56:38,620
What's your favorite part about this game?

2815
01:56:39,060 --> 01:56:40,060
I don't know.

2816
01:56:40,220 --> 01:56:40,680
I don't know.

2817
01:56:41,760 --> 01:56:45,420
I guess the atmosphere is really- I like the atmosphere of this.

2818
01:56:47,360 --> 01:56:48,680
It's not spooky though.

2819
01:56:48,900 --> 01:56:50,180
It's not like...

2820
01:56:50,180 --> 01:56:53,920
I guess there's parts where I scream but it's not like damn I'm spooked.

2821
01:56:54,960 --> 01:56:55,160
Please!

2822
01:56:55,160 --> 01:56:55,400
Please!

2823
01:56:55,540 --> 01:56:55,800
No!

2824
01:56:56,080 --> 01:56:56,360
No!

2825
01:56:56,480 --> 01:57:00,520
I couldn't climb.

2826
01:57:00,740 --> 01:57:02,180
I couldn't climb just then.

2827
01:57:02,420 --> 01:57:03,580
But... but...

2828
01:57:05,400 --> 01:57:05,960
Okay.

2829
01:57:11,800 --> 01:57:12,360
Alright.

2830
01:57:13,700 --> 01:57:13,980
Alright.

2831
01:57:14,060 --> 01:57:15,520
We... we opened the door.

2832
01:57:16,660 --> 01:57:17,220
Okay.

2833
01:57:17,300 --> 01:57:17,700
Please.

2834
01:57:17,900 --> 01:57:18,660
Please don't...

2835
01:57:18,660 --> 01:57:20,780
I'm holding onto it this time.

2836
01:57:20,780 --> 01:57:20,940
I...

2837
01:57:25,680 --> 01:57:27,560
I don't know why I live there.

2838
01:57:27,700 --> 01:57:28,240
I don't know.

2839
01:57:32,230 --> 01:57:34,790
I don't even know how far we are in this game right now.

2840
01:57:39,170 --> 01:57:39,850
Oh yeah!

2841
01:57:39,970 --> 01:57:40,730
I heard that.

2842
01:57:40,770 --> 01:57:42,090
I heard there's also DLC too.

2843
01:57:42,750 --> 01:57:45,230
But we're not playing the DLC after this.

2844
01:57:45,630 --> 01:57:47,570
We're just gonna try and finish this one.

2845
01:57:47,610 --> 01:57:48,070
This one.

2846
01:57:50,710 --> 01:57:53,070
I wanna finish this for a two day stream.

2847
01:57:55,150 --> 01:57:56,550
What the fuck!

2848
01:58:01,930 --> 01:58:03,530
What the fuck!

2849
01:58:11,780 --> 01:58:13,300
Wrong way.

2850
01:58:17,230 --> 01:58:17,990
Okay.

2851
01:58:19,470 --> 01:58:20,230
Yeah.

2852
01:58:20,370 --> 01:58:21,170
Yeah bitch!

2853
01:58:22,790 --> 01:58:24,250
That's very stupid.

2854
01:58:29,110 --> 01:58:30,630
Get your hand away.

2855
01:58:33,090 --> 01:58:34,950
Dude how long is he gonna...

2856
01:58:34,950 --> 01:58:35,590
Holy God.

2857
01:58:35,590 --> 01:58:37,230
Thank you so much for the follow, Tashi.

2858
01:58:37,370 --> 01:58:37,750
thank you.

2859
01:58:37,770 --> 01:58:38,030
Thank you.

2860
01:58:38,050 --> 01:58:38,390
Thank you.

2861
01:58:38,510 --> 01:58:42,710
Oh I just have to run when he puts his hand up like that.

2862
01:58:43,370 --> 01:58:43,690
Okay.

2863
01:58:45,710 --> 01:58:46,030
Stupid.

2864
01:58:55,190 --> 01:58:55,510
Okay.

2865
01:58:57,650 --> 01:58:58,490
Is this a kitchen?

2866
01:58:59,270 --> 01:58:59,590
Oh!

2867
01:58:59,590 --> 01:58:59,790
Oh!

2868
01:58:59,870 --> 01:59:00,010
Oh!

2869
01:59:00,030 --> 01:59:00,290
Please!

2870
01:59:00,490 --> 01:59:00,770
Please!

2871
01:59:00,870 --> 01:59:01,110
Please!

2872
01:59:01,270 --> 01:59:01,470
No!

2873
01:59:01,650 --> 01:59:01,910
No!

2874
01:59:03,430 --> 01:59:03,750
No!

2875
01:59:03,930 --> 01:59:05,170
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2876
01:59:05,690 --> 01:59:06,850
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2877
01:59:07,070 --> 01:59:08,010
No, no, no, no, no, no.

2878
01:59:08,070 --> 01:59:08,390
No.

2879
01:59:08,730 --> 01:59:09,710
Yeah, stupid.

2880
01:59:14,570 --> 01:59:16,890
Oh, wait, wait, wait, why is your hand so long?

2881
01:59:17,010 --> 01:59:18,050
Why is your hand so long?

2882
01:59:18,190 --> 01:59:18,550
Please!

2883
01:59:20,770 --> 01:59:21,590
That's stupid.

2884
01:59:25,970 --> 01:59:27,190
Wait, wait, no!

2885
01:59:32,830 --> 01:59:34,430
He still got me.

2886
01:59:35,510 --> 01:59:37,110
How was I supposed to know?

2887
01:59:41,970 --> 01:59:42,470
No!

2888
01:59:42,470 --> 01:59:43,650
How do I get out of the game?

2889
01:59:46,810 --> 01:59:48,930
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

2890
01:59:48,930 --> 01:59:49,290
Stupid.

2891
01:59:55,310 --> 01:59:57,570
Oh, no, don't touch me.

2892
01:59:57,770 --> 01:59:59,670
No, climb again!

2893
02:00:03,110 --> 02:00:04,890
Yeah, yeah, I know now.

2894
02:00:05,110 --> 02:00:05,950
I know now.

2895
02:00:15,890 --> 02:00:16,970
Hurry up!

2896
02:00:16,970 --> 02:00:18,470
Hurry up and slam it!

2897
02:00:18,670 --> 02:00:19,630
Slam it!

2898
02:00:20,010 --> 02:00:20,630
Please!

2899
02:00:20,950 --> 02:00:22,290
I don't know how long I can do this!

2900
02:00:22,930 --> 02:00:24,430
I don't know how long...

2901
02:00:29,490 --> 02:00:32,150
Holy shit, how strong is this thing?

2902
02:00:34,150 --> 02:00:35,310
Please, no!

2903
02:00:35,710 --> 02:00:36,310
No!

2904
02:00:36,830 --> 02:00:37,450
No!

2905
02:00:40,150 --> 02:00:42,330
Is it not gonna close?

2906
02:00:44,430 --> 02:00:45,470
Am I gonna do this forever?

2907
02:00:56,050 --> 02:00:56,990
Wait, I think...

2908
02:00:56,990 --> 02:00:57,890
I don't think this is...

2909
02:00:57,890 --> 02:00:59,830
I don't think this is what I'm supposed to do, guys.

2910
02:00:59,970 --> 02:01:00,590
I don't think...

2911
02:01:00,590 --> 02:01:02,850
I don't think this is what I'm supposed to do.

2912
02:01:05,550 --> 02:01:07,410
I don't think it's ever gonna break.

2913
02:01:07,830 --> 02:01:10,630
I just realized that thing's not gonna break ever.

2914
02:01:13,070 --> 02:01:13,470
Okay.

2915
02:01:13,630 --> 02:01:14,770
What do I do here?

2916
02:01:15,150 --> 02:01:16,050
I'm looking up.

2917
02:01:16,230 --> 02:01:17,710
I'm looking up respectfully.

2918
02:01:18,410 --> 02:01:19,950
I'm looking up respectfully.

2919
02:01:20,070 --> 02:01:20,490
Do I...

2920
02:01:20,490 --> 02:01:22,410
No, no, no, no, no.

2921
02:01:22,650 --> 02:01:23,470
No, no, no, no, no!

2922
02:01:23,470 --> 02:01:23,970
No, no, no!

2923
02:01:24,710 --> 02:01:25,510
What do I do?

2924
02:01:25,810 --> 02:01:27,650
I'm just doing this over and over again.

2925
02:01:28,310 --> 02:01:28,710
I...

2926
02:01:28,710 --> 02:01:30,090
I don't know...

2927
02:01:30,470 --> 02:01:30,670
I...

2928
02:01:30,670 --> 02:01:31,970
I don't know what to do!

2929
02:01:32,610 --> 02:01:32,890
Ah...

2930
02:01:35,690 --> 02:01:36,450
Don't touch me!

2931
02:01:36,690 --> 02:01:37,590
Don't touch me!

2932
02:01:38,250 --> 02:01:38,650
Ah...

2933
02:01:39,710 --> 02:01:40,110
Ah...

2934
02:01:40,110 --> 02:01:40,190
Ah...

2935
02:01:40,190 --> 02:01:41,210
Is this?

2936
02:01:41,450 --> 02:01:41,830
No!

2937
02:01:42,330 --> 02:01:43,290
What am I doing?

2938
02:01:43,870 --> 02:01:44,670
What am I doing?

2939
02:01:46,890 --> 02:01:47,910
You're in the middle, pull that.

2940
02:01:48,030 --> 02:01:48,590
How though?

2941
02:01:48,730 --> 02:01:49,670
How do I pull this?

2942
02:01:49,870 --> 02:01:51,150
I can't pull this at all!

2943
02:01:52,170 --> 02:01:54,010
I can't... I can't pull anything!

2944
02:01:54,790 --> 02:01:55,650
What do I pull?

2945
02:01:56,070 --> 02:01:57,670
What do I... Oh!

2946
02:01:57,910 --> 02:01:58,310
This.

2947
02:02:00,610 --> 02:02:02,910
Do I pull you?

2948
02:02:03,050 --> 02:02:03,670
No, no!

2949
02:02:03,730 --> 02:02:04,270
He's gonna pick me!

2950
02:02:04,390 --> 02:02:04,670
No!

2951
02:02:04,790 --> 02:02:04,990
No!

2952
02:02:12,470 --> 02:02:13,030
Okay, wait...

2953
02:02:14,370 --> 02:02:15,010
Okay, I know now.

2954
02:02:15,110 --> 02:02:15,850
I know now.

2955
02:02:16,070 --> 02:02:16,550
I know now.

2956
02:02:16,650 --> 02:02:17,010
I know now.

2957
02:02:17,150 --> 02:02:17,510
I know now.

2958
02:02:18,670 --> 02:02:18,950
Okay,

2959
02:02:22,030 --> 02:02:22,190
okay.

2960
02:02:22,270 --> 02:02:24,250
My brain is working.

2961
02:02:28,010 --> 02:02:29,630
No, no, no, no!

2962
02:02:30,150 --> 02:02:30,650
No, no, no.

2963
02:02:31,270 --> 02:02:32,550
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2964
02:02:34,370 --> 02:02:36,410
I'm figuring it out.

2965
02:02:36,550 --> 02:02:37,230
I'm figuring it out.

2966
02:02:37,570 --> 02:02:39,330
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2967
02:02:43,150 --> 02:02:44,430
I'm trying chat!

2968
02:02:45,250 --> 02:02:46,370
Oh no!

2969
02:02:47,430 --> 02:02:47,830
Oh no!

2970
02:02:48,490 --> 02:02:49,010
Yeah!

2971
02:02:50,830 --> 02:02:51,390
Stupid!

2972
02:02:55,550 --> 02:02:56,490
Wait, there's more?

2973
02:02:56,730 --> 02:02:57,970
Oh shit, there's more!

2974
02:02:58,170 --> 02:02:59,790
I celebrated too early.

2975
02:03:00,110 --> 02:03:02,030
I celebrated too early.

2976
02:03:03,030 --> 02:03:05,070
That was nice of them to know there was more.

2977
02:03:05,450 --> 02:03:07,210
Come on, come on, come on!

2978
02:03:07,410 --> 02:03:08,230
Yeah, stupid!

2979
02:03:08,230 --> 02:03:08,670
Stupid!

2980
02:03:09,690 --> 02:03:10,690
You see that?

2981
02:03:10,910 --> 02:03:11,550
Oh, wait!

2982
02:03:11,670 --> 02:03:12,650
His arm's still grabbing me!

2983
02:03:15,030 --> 02:03:15,510
Yeah...

2984
02:03:16,770 --> 02:03:17,250
Stupid...

2985
02:03:20,830 --> 02:03:22,250
Yeah, I'm so smart.

2986
02:03:23,770 --> 02:03:24,690
I'm so smart.

2987
02:03:29,500 --> 02:03:32,300
Yeah, that's right.

2988
02:03:32,680 --> 02:03:33,360
That's right.

2989
02:03:33,540 --> 02:03:34,380
What's he gonna do now?

2990
02:03:34,660 --> 02:03:35,720
What are you gonna do now, huh?

2991
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:37,400
I'm deep banging his arm.

2992
02:03:38,120 --> 02:03:39,580
What are you gonna do now, huh?

2993
02:03:39,600 --> 02:03:40,740
Yeah, that's right.

2994
02:03:41,360 --> 02:03:42,120
That's right.

2995
02:03:46,970 --> 02:03:47,850
Yeah, progress.

2996
02:03:48,130 --> 02:03:48,950
We're making progress.

2997
02:04:01,020 --> 02:04:02,040
The lair.

2998
02:04:02,320 --> 02:04:02,600
Ooh.

2999
02:04:04,480 --> 02:04:05,460
The lair.

3000
02:04:05,940 --> 02:04:06,780
Sounds spooky.

3001
02:04:11,420 --> 02:04:12,820
You crippled that guy?

3002
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:14,080
Dude, he deserves it.

3003
02:04:14,160 --> 02:04:15,320
He deserves it.

3004
02:04:16,740 --> 02:04:19,100
That's what you get for getting long arms.

3005
02:04:19,820 --> 02:04:21,480
Just be like the rest of us.

3006
02:04:21,540 --> 02:04:22,240
We're short arms.

3007
02:04:29,820 --> 02:04:30,260
Just be like the rest of us.

3008
02:04:30,260 --> 02:04:31,080
Alright, really let me hydrate.

3009
02:04:31,180 --> 02:04:32,840
Cause I feel like I won't be able to hydrate later.

3010
02:04:38,290 --> 02:04:39,890
Holy shit, my arm broke there.

3011
02:04:42,810 --> 02:04:43,250
Alright.

3012
02:04:47,980 --> 02:04:49,720
Hopefully no more creepy-ass monsters.

3013
02:04:49,840 --> 02:04:49,880
Hopefully no more creepy-ass monsters.

3014
02:04:49,880 --> 02:04:50,360
What am I saying?

3015
02:04:50,440 --> 02:04:51,480
They're all scary as hell.

3016
02:04:51,660 --> 02:04:52,700
We haven't seen the...

3017
02:04:52,700 --> 02:04:54,700
We haven't seen the chef yet.

3018
02:04:55,240 --> 02:04:56,500
Yeah, I guess what he's...

3019
02:04:58,240 --> 02:04:59,680
I thought that was him.

3020
02:04:59,760 --> 02:05:00,940
I thought that was the creepy-ass chef.

3021
02:05:00,940 --> 02:05:01,340
Creepy guy.

3022
02:05:02,880 --> 02:05:04,180
Did I grab onto this?

3023
02:05:04,520 --> 02:05:05,400
Oh I do.

3024
02:05:09,710 --> 02:05:10,270
Wee.

3025
02:05:15,300 --> 02:05:15,860
Wee.

3026
02:05:20,080 --> 02:05:20,920
There's the chef!

3027
02:05:21,240 --> 02:05:22,240
There he is!

3028
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:23,960
I see you!

3029
02:05:25,900 --> 02:05:27,180
I know you're next.

3030
02:05:28,440 --> 02:05:31,080
I remember the chef being the next boss.

3031
02:05:32,320 --> 02:05:32,840
Oh!

3032
02:05:33,900 --> 02:05:35,520
Doo doo doo doo doo.

3033
02:05:36,140 --> 02:05:37,600
Oh I'm hungry again.

3034
02:05:37,700 --> 02:05:38,080
Oh no.

3035
02:05:40,060 --> 02:05:40,820
I'm hungry.

3036
02:05:41,020 --> 02:05:42,160
Just eat those bodies here.

3037
02:05:42,220 --> 02:05:42,800
Isn't this meat?

3038
02:05:43,140 --> 02:05:44,340
Why can't you eat this?

3039
02:05:45,020 --> 02:05:46,020
I don't understand.

3040
02:05:46,280 --> 02:05:46,920
Just open it.

3041
02:05:48,400 --> 02:05:49,280
Meat is meat.

3042
02:05:53,940 --> 02:05:56,740
Look he's trying to figure out this game is the best thing ever.

3043
02:05:57,140 --> 02:05:58,160
Oh my god.

3044
02:06:01,020 --> 02:06:02,380
Eating people now.

3045
02:06:03,600 --> 02:06:05,020
The chef always creeps out.

3046
02:06:05,080 --> 02:06:07,740
He's haunted my nightmares several times.

3047
02:06:07,880 --> 02:06:08,420
Oh shit.

3048
02:06:08,540 --> 02:06:09,860
Is he creepier than long boy?

3049
02:06:11,140 --> 02:06:13,280
How can he be creepier than long boy?

3050
02:06:19,200 --> 02:06:20,440
Yeah I'm gonna eat ya.

3051
02:06:20,800 --> 02:06:21,880
I'm gonna eat ya.

3052
02:06:22,720 --> 02:06:23,680
Yeah that's right.

3053
02:06:24,280 --> 02:06:24,760
Yeah.

3054
02:06:26,720 --> 02:06:27,940
Wait I'm not eating this?

3055
02:06:28,260 --> 02:06:28,920
Oh okay.

3056
02:06:29,040 --> 02:06:30,440
I thought I was gonna eat the rat.

3057
02:06:30,680 --> 02:06:31,880
I thought I was gonna...

3058
02:06:34,800 --> 02:06:36,920
I thought I was gonna eat the rat.

3059
02:06:37,080 --> 02:06:38,420
Wait I do?

3060
02:06:39,280 --> 02:06:40,140
I do?

3061
02:06:40,260 --> 02:06:41,480
Why wouldn't you let me eat him?

3062
02:06:45,440 --> 02:06:46,480
Let me eat you.

3063
02:06:47,780 --> 02:06:48,340
Yeah.

3064
02:06:48,820 --> 02:06:49,880
Oh my god.

3065
02:06:50,160 --> 02:06:51,240
Oh my god.

3066
02:06:54,600 --> 02:06:55,720
Holy shit.

3067
02:07:02,400 --> 02:07:02,960
Um.

3068
02:07:04,300 --> 02:07:05,200
Stupid rat.

3069
02:07:11,020 --> 02:07:11,820
See he'll...

3070
02:07:12,440 --> 02:07:13,260
Kinda sad.

3071
02:07:13,260 --> 02:07:14,340
It's pretty sad.

3072
02:07:16,020 --> 02:07:16,580
Like.

3073
02:07:16,580 --> 02:07:17,440
Poor rat.

3074
02:07:20,520 --> 02:07:22,300
Why did I join in?

3075
02:07:22,380 --> 02:07:23,500
Oh she just ate a rat.

3076
02:07:24,100 --> 02:07:24,660
Raw.

3077
02:07:25,040 --> 02:07:26,120
She could've at least cooked it.

3078
02:07:26,300 --> 02:07:27,840
I guess I've never ate rats.

3079
02:07:28,200 --> 02:07:32,880
Apparently you can eat cooked rats in somewhere in the world.

3080
02:07:33,520 --> 02:07:33,920
Um.

3081
02:07:35,120 --> 02:07:36,080
Food is food.

3082
02:07:43,190 --> 02:07:44,250
Can I push this?

3083
02:07:44,430 --> 02:07:45,270
I push you.

3084
02:07:57,320 --> 02:07:57,800
Oh.

3085
02:07:57,920 --> 02:07:58,300
What?

3086
02:07:58,380 --> 02:07:59,160
What the hell?

3087
02:07:59,240 --> 02:08:00,100
It won't let me in.

3088
02:08:00,820 --> 02:08:02,080
It pushed me back.

3089
02:08:02,760 --> 02:08:04,180
At least you're not hungry anymore.

3090
02:08:04,260 --> 02:08:04,440
Yeah.

3091
02:08:05,320 --> 02:08:07,320
It's a ratty rat world here.

3092
02:08:09,660 --> 02:08:11,180
Do do do do do do.

3093
02:08:11,180 --> 02:08:11,840
Do do do do do do.

3094
02:08:12,060 --> 02:08:12,680
Do do.

3095
02:08:14,160 --> 02:08:14,640
Oh.

3096
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:16,760
Let me up.

3097
02:08:17,400 --> 02:08:18,200
Let me up.

3098
02:08:18,960 --> 02:08:20,220
Let me up.

3099
02:08:21,760 --> 02:08:22,240
What?

3100
02:08:23,200 --> 02:08:23,720
What's that?

3101
02:08:26,820 --> 02:08:27,760
Oh that's the chef.

3102
02:08:28,300 --> 02:08:29,100
That's the chef.

3103
02:08:31,640 --> 02:08:32,540
There he is.

3104
02:08:34,200 --> 02:08:35,020
There he is.

3105
02:08:35,180 --> 02:08:36,040
There he is.

3106
02:08:36,180 --> 02:08:36,960
There he is.

3107
02:08:40,020 --> 02:08:41,220
Oh you're ugly!

3108
02:08:49,960 --> 02:08:51,640
I just used my new channel.

3109
02:08:52,080 --> 02:08:54,300
I only put the reasoner back on.

3110
02:08:54,400 --> 02:08:55,640
Dude I don't...

3111
02:09:00,390 --> 02:09:01,830
What the hell...

3112
02:09:01,830 --> 02:09:02,830
What do you mean?

3113
02:09:03,330 --> 02:09:04,050
Look at...

3114
02:09:04,050 --> 02:09:06,270
No, no, no, no, no.

3115
02:09:07,050 --> 02:09:07,870
No, no, no.

3116
02:09:07,870 --> 02:09:08,710
Why are you screaming?

3117
02:09:08,930 --> 02:09:09,870
Why are you screaming?

3118
02:09:13,580 --> 02:09:14,780
What the fuck?

3119
02:09:20,300 --> 02:09:22,900
He's screaming so I scream too.

3120
02:09:25,960 --> 02:09:28,200
Maybe it's because you're still alive.

3121
02:09:28,600 --> 02:09:29,280
Maybe it's because you're still alive.

3122
02:09:29,280 --> 02:09:31,720
I was like, why are you screaming?

3123
02:09:31,860 --> 02:09:33,260
Why scream at you?

3124
02:09:39,540 --> 02:09:42,300
I look like a running banana.

3125
02:09:42,640 --> 02:09:44,560
How do I do this?

3126
02:09:48,130 --> 02:09:49,510
He doesn't know.

3127
02:09:49,690 --> 02:09:50,390
He's stupid.

3128
02:09:56,210 --> 02:09:58,410
He just wants to consume.

3129
02:10:03,080 --> 02:10:04,720
Maybe I don't run.

3130
02:10:05,440 --> 02:10:07,140
Maybe that's the play here.

3131
02:10:07,240 --> 02:10:08,540
Maybe I just don't run.

3132
02:10:08,540 --> 02:10:10,160
Can I hide here?

3133
02:10:18,480 --> 02:10:19,280
I look.

3134
02:10:20,580 --> 02:10:21,380
I look.

3135
02:10:22,520 --> 02:10:24,020
I am looking respectfully.

3136
02:10:26,700 --> 02:10:28,040
Where do I hide here though?

3137
02:10:33,110 --> 02:10:34,070
I hide.

3138
02:10:34,590 --> 02:10:36,530
Can't see me, you stupid.

3139
02:10:38,590 --> 02:10:39,950
Where do I hide there though?

3140
02:10:40,210 --> 02:10:41,350
I don't know where to hide.

3141
02:10:43,650 --> 02:10:44,810
Okay, where do you go?

3142
02:10:45,690 --> 02:10:46,350
Where do you go?

3143
02:10:46,370 --> 02:10:46,610
Where do you go?

3144
02:10:47,630 --> 02:10:49,230
You guys want to see his face?

3145
02:10:49,730 --> 02:10:50,030
I mean...

3146
02:10:50,030 --> 02:10:51,890
I can't move away.

3147
02:10:53,710 --> 02:10:55,530
You hide in his belly.

3148
02:10:56,210 --> 02:10:57,710
I look respectfully.

3149
02:10:58,270 --> 02:11:00,430
I'm looking respectfully at him.

3150
02:11:02,630 --> 02:11:03,810
How come he has hair?

3151
02:11:06,030 --> 02:11:07,350
Oh wait, what the fuck?

3152
02:11:09,130 --> 02:11:10,990
Oh shit, no he doesn't have hair.

3153
02:11:11,030 --> 02:11:13,110
He just ripped his... That's not his skin.

3154
02:11:22,700 --> 02:11:23,100
Oh!

3155
02:11:23,180 --> 02:11:23,620
He doesn't know!

3156
02:11:23,680 --> 02:11:24,180
He doesn't know!

3157
02:11:24,260 --> 02:11:24,680
You don't know!

3158
02:11:24,720 --> 02:11:25,000
You don't know!

3159
02:11:25,100 --> 02:11:25,500
No!

3160
02:11:25,700 --> 02:11:25,700
No!

3161
02:11:25,800 --> 02:11:25,800
No!

3162
02:11:27,380 --> 02:11:28,500
I can't get it!

3163
02:11:30,500 --> 02:11:30,900
No!

3164
02:11:36,860 --> 02:11:37,860
How did you do?

3165
02:11:40,200 --> 02:11:41,300
I couldn't slide.

3166
02:11:45,560 --> 02:11:45,960
Okay.

3167
02:11:46,700 --> 02:11:47,100
Okay.

3168
02:11:47,300 --> 02:11:48,480
I have to do this again.

3169
02:11:48,880 --> 02:11:49,700
I hate this.

3170
02:11:49,940 --> 02:11:50,540
I hate this.

3171
02:11:54,800 --> 02:11:56,440
Admiral, thank you so much for the follow!

3172
02:11:56,560 --> 02:11:56,980
Thank you!

3173
02:11:57,020 --> 02:11:57,320
Thank you!

3174
02:11:57,400 --> 02:11:57,800
Thank you!

3175
02:11:58,220 --> 02:12:00,400
Have a butter!

3176
02:12:00,600 --> 02:12:01,080
Thank you!

3177
02:12:01,100 --> 02:12:01,420
Thank you!

3178
02:12:01,440 --> 02:12:01,640
Thank you!

3179
02:12:01,800 --> 02:12:02,320
Okay.

3180
02:12:02,480 --> 02:12:03,700
I'm looking respectfully.

3181
02:12:04,040 --> 02:12:05,580
I'm looking respectfully.

3182
02:12:05,920 --> 02:12:06,880
I go...

3183
02:12:12,010 --> 02:12:13,450
I'm looking respectfully.

3184
02:12:13,450 --> 02:12:14,270
I'm sorry.

3185
02:12:14,470 --> 02:12:14,990
I'm sorry.

3186
02:12:17,890 --> 02:12:18,710
I'm sorry.

3187
02:12:19,950 --> 02:12:20,470
Please.

3188
02:12:20,470 --> 02:12:20,990
Please.

3189
02:12:21,010 --> 02:12:21,510
I'm sorry.

3190
02:12:23,910 --> 02:12:24,430
Oh!

3191
02:12:24,430 --> 02:12:24,950
Oh!

3192
02:12:29,690 --> 02:12:30,130
Okay.

3193
02:12:30,750 --> 02:12:31,190
Okay.

3194
02:12:32,090 --> 02:12:32,530
Alright.

3195
02:12:32,530 --> 02:12:32,890
Alright.

3196
02:12:32,910 --> 02:12:33,050
Go.

3197
02:12:33,230 --> 02:12:33,870
Here you go.

3198
02:12:33,970 --> 02:12:34,090
Go.

3199
02:12:35,930 --> 02:12:36,370
Alright.

3200
02:12:36,590 --> 02:12:38,690
I'm looking respectfully at him.

3201
02:12:39,470 --> 02:12:39,910
I'm looking respectfully at him.

3202
02:12:39,910 --> 02:12:39,930
Okay.

3203
02:12:40,090 --> 02:12:40,370
Okay.

3204
02:12:40,450 --> 02:12:40,670
Okay.

3205
02:12:45,150 --> 02:12:46,030
Oh my...

3206
02:12:47,110 --> 02:12:47,550
Oh!

3207
02:12:48,010 --> 02:12:48,450
No!

3208
02:12:48,870 --> 02:12:49,510
You don't know!

3209
02:12:49,690 --> 02:12:50,230
You don't know!

3210
02:12:50,490 --> 02:12:50,930
What?!

3211
02:12:50,930 --> 02:12:52,010
How?!

3212
02:12:53,470 --> 02:12:54,550
How does he know?

3213
02:12:54,670 --> 02:12:55,350
How does he know?

3214
02:12:56,070 --> 02:12:56,950
How does he know?

3215
02:12:58,030 --> 02:12:58,470
Yeah.

3216
02:12:59,450 --> 02:12:59,810
He doesn't.

3217
02:12:59,970 --> 02:13:00,970
He doesn't know.

3218
02:13:01,270 --> 02:13:02,650
I'm looking respectfully.

3219
02:13:04,890 --> 02:13:05,830
He doesn't know.

3220
02:13:11,140 --> 02:13:12,900
He had a cut feeling.

3221
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:13,840
Oh my god.

3222
02:13:13,920 --> 02:13:15,380
I don't know how to do this one.

3223
02:13:22,050 --> 02:13:23,590
Make a break for it.

3224
02:13:23,730 --> 02:13:26,570
The last time I did that, I got cut!

3225
02:13:30,480 --> 02:13:31,300
Go here?

3226
02:13:36,040 --> 02:13:37,060
Don't get cut.

3227
02:13:47,560 --> 02:13:48,600
Looking respectfully.

3228
02:13:49,160 --> 02:13:50,760
That's my strategy.

3229
02:13:51,020 --> 02:13:52,580
Looking respectfully.

3230
02:13:53,040 --> 02:14:01,020
I'm a very respectful person.

3231
02:14:02,580 --> 02:14:03,700
You bitch.

3232
02:14:11,330 --> 02:14:13,490
Looking respectfully.

3233
02:14:17,030 --> 02:14:17,730
What?!

3234
02:14:21,020 --> 02:14:22,440
Looking!

3235
02:14:22,580 --> 02:14:23,540
Looking respectfully!

3236
02:14:23,900 --> 02:14:24,560
Looking...

3237
02:14:29,280 --> 02:14:29,800
How?!

3238
02:14:31,080 --> 02:14:32,980
I'm a respectful person!

3239
02:14:33,540 --> 02:14:35,040
I'm respecting you!

3240
02:14:35,420 --> 02:14:37,300
I'm respecting you!

3241
02:14:38,060 --> 02:14:39,480
Oh, I don't like this.

3242
02:14:39,800 --> 02:14:41,020
I don't like this.

3243
02:14:44,300 --> 02:14:45,900
Okay, I need to know his...

3244
02:14:45,900 --> 02:14:47,220
What is he doing?

3245
02:14:47,280 --> 02:14:48,300
Cutting some fishies.

3246
02:14:50,420 --> 02:14:50,940
Okay.

3247
02:14:51,820 --> 02:14:52,340
Okay.

3248
02:14:52,360 --> 02:14:52,660
Okay.

3249
02:14:52,840 --> 02:14:53,360
Alright.

3250
02:14:53,880 --> 02:14:54,940
He doesn't know.

3251
02:14:55,420 --> 02:14:57,000
He doesn't know that's my heart.

3252
02:14:57,000 --> 02:14:58,560
Going ba dum ba dum ba dum.

3253
02:14:59,100 --> 02:15:00,100
He doesn't know.

3254
02:15:00,360 --> 02:15:01,300
Yeah, he's stupid.

3255
02:15:02,060 --> 02:15:02,460
Stupid.

3256
02:15:06,700 --> 02:15:07,320
Look it up.

3257
02:15:07,480 --> 02:15:08,520
There's a key?!

3258
02:15:08,520 --> 02:15:10,400
Where the fuck do I get the key?!

3259
02:15:14,510 --> 02:15:14,910
Okay.

3260
02:15:15,050 --> 02:15:15,410
Okay.

3261
02:15:15,510 --> 02:15:15,710
Okay.

3262
02:15:15,710 --> 02:15:15,710
Okay.

3263
02:15:15,710 --> 02:15:16,530
This is how I do it.

3264
02:15:16,790 --> 02:15:17,190
Okay.

3265
02:15:17,450 --> 02:15:17,850
Okay.

3266
02:15:18,410 --> 02:15:18,810
Okay.

3267
02:15:21,370 --> 02:15:21,770
Okay.

3268
02:15:24,790 --> 02:15:25,950
Oh, it's on him!

3269
02:15:26,090 --> 02:15:26,350
Oh!

3270
02:15:29,110 --> 02:15:29,510
Okay.

3271
02:15:33,840 --> 02:15:34,240
Okay.

3272
02:15:40,360 --> 02:15:40,760
Alright.

3273
02:15:40,820 --> 02:15:41,220
Alright.

3274
02:15:41,320 --> 02:15:42,460
I just need to knock him out.

3275
02:15:42,720 --> 02:15:43,120
Right?

3276
02:15:43,900 --> 02:15:45,160
That's all I have to do.

3277
02:15:46,300 --> 02:15:47,500
I'm gonna knock you out.

3278
02:15:47,940 --> 02:15:48,340
I'm gonna knock you out.

3279
02:15:50,600 --> 02:15:52,940
God, if I die here, I have to do this all over again.

3280
02:15:53,820 --> 02:15:54,940
I don't wanna die!

3281
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:57,780
I don't wanna redo this!

3282
02:15:57,960 --> 02:15:58,920
I don't wanna keep looking!

3283
02:16:00,800 --> 02:16:01,620
What's over there?

3284
02:16:02,160 --> 02:16:03,020
What is this?

3285
02:16:09,020 --> 02:16:09,560
Okay...

3286
02:16:11,340 --> 02:16:11,880
Oh!

3287
02:16:12,500 --> 02:16:12,880
What?!

3288
02:16:12,880 --> 02:16:13,440
What the fuck?!

3289
02:16:13,440 --> 02:16:20,360
What the fuck was that?!

3290
02:16:20,360 --> 02:16:21,460
What?!

3291
02:16:22,200 --> 02:16:23,960
What the fuck?!

3292
02:16:25,580 --> 02:16:28,920
What the fuck did I just do?

3293
02:16:35,070 --> 02:16:36,750
He's a motherfucker!

3294
02:16:36,830 --> 02:16:37,770
Shit...

3295
02:16:43,170 --> 02:16:45,050
What the fuck?

3296
02:16:45,110 --> 02:16:47,470
That actually scared me.

3297
02:16:47,670 --> 02:16:48,950
What do I do here?

3298
02:16:49,470 --> 02:16:53,310
Oh shit, hey.

3299
02:17:00,450 --> 02:17:00,870
Yeah.

3300
02:17:01,310 --> 02:17:02,690
What are you?

3301
02:17:07,590 --> 02:17:08,410
What is this?

3302
02:17:09,910 --> 02:17:10,750
Wait.

3303
02:17:24,820 --> 02:17:27,140
Wait, where am I?

3304
02:17:29,420 --> 02:17:30,220
Hey, Ray.

3305
02:17:31,200 --> 02:17:32,540
I don't know what I did.

3306
02:17:32,740 --> 02:17:34,820
I actually don't know what I did.

3307
02:17:36,380 --> 02:17:37,500
Is this a checkpoint?

3308
02:17:52,150 --> 02:17:52,990
Oh, key.

3309
02:17:54,390 --> 02:17:54,950
Key.

3310
02:17:56,070 --> 02:17:56,630
Key.

3311
02:17:59,330 --> 02:18:00,630
Who are you?

3312
02:18:01,010 --> 02:18:02,370
No, I'm sorry.

3313
02:18:02,550 --> 02:18:03,430
I'm so sorry.

3314
02:18:04,230 --> 02:18:05,470
I'm so sorry.

3315
02:18:07,910 --> 02:18:08,630
That's a no.

3316
02:18:09,190 --> 02:18:09,370
You don't know.

3317
02:18:09,450 --> 02:18:10,070
You don't know?

3318
02:18:10,130 --> 02:18:10,630
Oh, he knew.

3319
02:18:10,750 --> 02:18:11,130
He knew.

3320
02:18:14,830 --> 02:18:15,890
I'm so sorry.

3321
02:18:16,590 --> 02:18:18,590
I'm sorry for waking you up.

3322
02:18:27,840 --> 02:18:29,860
Can we tell them where it is?

3323
02:18:34,820 --> 02:18:36,380
How the heck did you do that?

3324
02:18:41,100 --> 02:18:41,520
Okay.

3325
02:18:41,580 --> 02:18:41,900
Okay.

3326
02:18:44,780 --> 02:18:45,440
Oh shit.

3327
02:18:45,480 --> 02:18:46,760
That's why they're double toilets!

3328
02:18:46,900 --> 02:18:47,280
They're twins!

3329
02:18:47,580 --> 02:18:48,380
Is that what twins do?

3330
02:18:48,600 --> 02:18:49,820
Do you guys poop with each other?

3331
02:18:50,220 --> 02:18:51,560
Are there any twins in chat?

3332
02:18:52,560 --> 02:18:54,880
Is this why there are any twins in chat?

3333
02:18:57,060 --> 02:18:58,200
Is that what you guys do?

3334
02:18:58,360 --> 02:18:59,600
We have toilets next to you?

3335
02:19:02,840 --> 02:19:04,920
Why else is there like double toilets?

3336
02:19:08,360 --> 02:19:10,300
You guys poop next to each other like that.

3337
02:19:10,520 --> 02:19:11,200
Look, look, see?

3338
02:19:11,900 --> 02:19:13,340
Any twins in chat?

3339
02:19:15,480 --> 02:19:16,540
I'm a twin in depth.

3340
02:19:16,720 --> 02:19:17,420
Are you hiding?

3341
02:19:17,640 --> 02:19:19,420
Fool, you don't have to lie to us.

3342
02:19:19,760 --> 02:19:20,960
We don't have to...

3343
02:19:20,960 --> 02:19:22,440
Is this a solid logic?

3344
02:19:23,660 --> 02:19:25,080
Well, you don't have to lie to us.

3345
02:19:25,180 --> 02:19:25,640
Don't worry.

3346
02:19:25,840 --> 02:19:26,760
It's our little secret.

3347
02:19:27,400 --> 02:19:28,920
It's our little secret.

3348
02:19:38,810 --> 02:19:39,990
It's our little secret.

3349
02:19:40,090 --> 02:19:40,890
Don't worry fool.

3350
02:19:42,350 --> 02:19:44,770
What if he poots but he needs two toilets?

3351
02:19:49,690 --> 02:19:50,130
Woo!

3352
02:19:52,890 --> 02:19:53,530
He don't know.

3353
02:19:53,630 --> 02:19:54,290
He don't know.

3354
02:20:02,240 --> 02:20:02,720
Stupid.

3355
02:20:12,500 --> 02:20:12,980
Okay.

3356
02:20:16,760 --> 02:20:17,780
Where did he go?

3357
02:20:29,700 --> 02:20:31,240
Okay, all right, all right.

3358
02:20:31,280 --> 02:20:31,760
We go down.

3359
02:20:31,920 --> 02:20:32,380
We go down.

3360
02:20:34,320 --> 02:20:34,800
Boom.

3361
02:20:35,200 --> 02:20:36,680
I'm so fucking smart.

3362
02:20:39,220 --> 02:20:40,760
He didn't fucking know.

3363
02:20:41,060 --> 02:20:41,860
Stupid twin.

3364
02:20:41,940 --> 02:20:43,300
He's the stupid twin, clearly.

3365
02:20:45,380 --> 02:20:46,740
Okay, now I have to do this again.

3366
02:20:46,940 --> 02:20:48,560
Now I have to do this again.

3367
02:20:50,360 --> 02:20:50,780
No!

3368
02:20:52,500 --> 02:20:53,400
Wait, where is he?

3369
02:20:56,280 --> 02:20:57,260
Oh, there he is.

3370
02:21:05,060 --> 02:21:06,060
Can I go under here?

3371
02:21:06,560 --> 02:21:07,260
I can.

3372
02:21:20,060 --> 02:21:20,480
Okay.

3373
02:21:20,480 --> 02:21:21,660
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

3374
02:21:22,440 --> 02:21:23,660
I'm looking respectfully.

3375
02:21:24,060 --> 02:21:26,340
I'm looking very respectfully right now.

3376
02:21:28,460 --> 02:21:28,640
Okay.

3377
02:21:30,120 --> 02:21:32,300
Stupid bitch, you stupid bitch, you stupid bitch.

3378
02:21:32,560 --> 02:21:33,320
No, no!

3379
02:21:33,440 --> 02:21:34,880
No, no he doesn't know, he doesn't know!

3380
02:21:34,920 --> 02:21:35,360
He doesn't know I'm here!

3381
02:21:40,880 --> 02:21:42,040

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

3385
02:21:59,010 --> 02:22:01,590
Please, please, get in, get in the key, get in the key.

3386
02:22:01,710 --> 02:22:02,670
Get in, get in, get in, get in!

3387
02:22:03,970 --> 02:22:04,290

3388
02:22:04,350 --> 02:22:04,530
Where?

3389
02:22:04,530 --> 02:22:05,390
Why did I pick up the log?

3390
02:22:07,870 --> 02:22:09,690
Why did I pick up the log this late?

3391
02:22:10,550 --> 02:22:11,370
Let me in!

3392
02:22:11,610 --> 02:22:12,350
Let me in!

3393
02:22:12,810 --> 02:22:13,250
Wait!

3394
02:22:19,250 --> 02:22:20,350
Let me out!

3395
02:22:20,510 --> 02:22:21,310
Let me out!

3396
02:22:25,990 --> 02:22:26,430
Okay.

3397
02:22:28,610 --> 02:22:29,330
I'm late.

3398
02:22:32,350 --> 02:22:33,110
Where do I go?

3399
02:22:40,040 --> 02:22:40,480
Jump.

3400
02:22:43,220 --> 02:22:43,460
Okay.

3401
02:22:46,740 --> 02:22:47,100
Okay.

3402
02:22:47,780 --> 02:22:48,140
Oh!

3403
02:22:48,320 --> 02:22:48,960
Oh, meat.

3404
02:22:51,440 --> 02:22:54,060
Cr-crimbo-crimbo-yut-to-you-you.

3405
02:22:54,080 --> 02:22:55,040
Thank you so much for the follow!

3406
02:22:55,120 --> 02:22:56,520
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

3407
02:22:56,660 --> 02:22:58,040
I really do appreciate it.

3408
02:22:58,160 --> 02:22:59,320
Oh shit, I'm making some sausages.

3409
02:23:00,800 --> 02:23:02,500
Thank you so much, Hamil Bloodheart.

3410
02:23:02,560 --> 02:23:03,520
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

3411
02:23:04,360 --> 02:23:04,720
Okay.

3412
02:23:07,360 --> 02:23:07,720
Meat.

3413
02:23:08,780 --> 02:23:09,600
No more meat.

3414
02:23:10,860 --> 02:23:11,900
Do I keep doing this?

3415
02:23:12,460 --> 02:23:12,820
No.

3416
02:23:14,280 --> 02:23:15,420
What is this?

3417
02:23:15,940 --> 02:23:16,620
What is this?

3418
02:23:16,940 --> 02:23:17,620
Bye?

3419
02:23:17,920 --> 02:23:18,700
I can't-

3420
02:23:24,520 --> 02:23:28,980
You know, she's- she's under, but you can't duck since that requires energy.

3421
02:23:29,940 --> 02:23:30,620
Okay.

3422
02:23:31,960 --> 02:23:32,640
Alright.

3423
02:23:34,340 --> 02:23:36,700
I need to get this meat in.

3424
02:23:39,900 --> 02:23:42,640
How do I put more sausages?

3425
02:23:43,260 --> 02:23:44,840
More sausages, please.

3426
02:23:51,650 --> 02:23:52,290
Wee.

3427
02:23:54,110 --> 02:23:54,750
Wee.

3428
02:23:54,930 --> 02:23:55,570
Wee.

3429
02:23:59,050 --> 02:23:59,510
...

3430
02:23:59,510 --> 02:23:59,810
Wee.

3431
02:24:02,990 --> 02:24:03,970
Alright, alright.

3432
02:24:05,570 --> 02:24:05,890
Alright.

3433
02:24:05,990 --> 02:24:06,630
No, no, no?

3434
02:24:07,150 --> 02:24:08,350
G-get in.

3435
02:24:08,450 --> 02:24:09,290
Get in the hole.

3436
02:24:09,750 --> 02:24:09,850
Get in the hole.

3437
02:24:10,170 --> 02:24:10,810
...

3438
02:24:10,810 --> 02:24:10,930
Get in the hole.

3439
02:24:12,570 --> 02:24:14,090
Is it Arby's?

3440
02:24:14,910 --> 02:24:16,370
Welcome to Arby's.

3441
02:24:18,630 --> 02:24:19,270
Alright.

3442
02:24:29,150 --> 02:24:29,790
Boop.

3443
02:24:34,260 --> 02:24:34,480
Okay.

3444
02:24:36,300 --> 02:24:38,820
And then I just do the turn turn.

3445
02:24:40,640 --> 02:24:42,840
And then... oh my god it looks like poop.

3446
02:24:43,600 --> 02:24:45,240
I'm so uncomfortable.

3447
02:24:48,020 --> 02:24:49,400
Is this enough?

3448
02:24:49,660 --> 02:24:50,420
Okay I need more.

3449
02:24:51,180 --> 02:24:52,680
That made it look so...

3450
02:24:54,060 --> 02:24:56,400
Oh shit I can pick up a sausage.

3451
02:25:01,820 --> 02:25:04,420
Oh my god this looks so fucking wrong.

3452
02:25:11,840 --> 02:25:14,940
Thank you so much for the follow, Rubio.

3453
02:25:15,120 --> 02:25:16,100
Thank you, thank you.

3454
02:25:16,200 --> 02:25:17,520
I do appreciate it.

3455
02:25:17,620 --> 02:25:18,640
That little butt heart.

3456
02:25:21,940 --> 02:25:25,740
Okay, we go up.

3457
02:25:27,440 --> 02:25:29,920
Mystery meat is the best when you meet.

3458
02:25:33,300 --> 02:25:37,000
How do I get more... more... more meat?

3459
02:25:37,240 --> 02:25:38,080
I need more.

3460
02:25:40,490 --> 02:25:41,420
I need more.

3461
02:25:45,750 --> 02:25:46,410
More!

3462
02:25:48,250 --> 02:25:50,490
Okay I can't fucking climb clearly.

3463
02:25:56,400 --> 02:25:57,330
I need more meat.

3464
02:26:08,400 --> 02:26:08,940
Give me!

3465
02:26:08,940 --> 02:26:09,660
Give... oh what the fuck?

3466
02:26:10,980 --> 02:26:12,100
Give... give me!

3467
02:26:12,300 --> 02:26:12,680
Oh!

3468
02:26:13,680 --> 02:26:14,120
Wait.

3469
02:26:15,120 --> 02:26:16,040
Did I fuck up?

3470
02:26:17,360 --> 02:26:17,800
What?

3471
02:26:19,600 --> 02:26:20,720
How do I...

3472
02:26:20,720 --> 02:26:21,460
How... brain.

3473
02:26:22,720 --> 02:26:24,600
Okay clearly it's not that thing.

3474
02:26:24,780 --> 02:26:26,180
Cause I can't get on top of it.

3475
02:26:27,040 --> 02:26:27,480
So...

3476
02:26:28,220 --> 02:26:29,400
What the fuck do I do?

3477
02:26:32,720 --> 02:26:33,520
Do I...

3478
02:26:34,100 --> 02:26:34,720
fuck it?

3479
02:26:36,380 --> 02:26:37,320
Do I move you bucket?

3480
02:26:38,120 --> 02:26:38,960
You bucket?

3481
02:26:40,600 --> 02:26:41,140
Bucket?

3482
02:26:41,140 --> 02:26:41,900
No, no bucket.

3483
02:26:43,240 --> 02:26:44,240
What the fuck?

3484
02:26:44,860 --> 02:26:45,860
Should be enough?

3485
02:26:46,080 --> 02:26:47,300
Okay let me try again.

3486
02:26:47,580 --> 02:26:48,220
Maybe I climb.

3487
02:26:51,440 --> 02:26:53,400
Oh it won't let me churn more meat.

3488
02:26:54,200 --> 02:26:54,740
Meat.

3489
02:26:56,760 --> 02:26:57,300
Oh.

3490
02:26:57,440 --> 02:26:59,420
Are you sure it's enough dude?

3491
02:27:01,160 --> 02:27:03,360
I don't think it's enough guys.

3492
02:27:05,720 --> 02:27:06,640
Can I climb?

3493
02:27:07,420 --> 02:27:07,900
Climb.

3494
02:27:08,560 --> 02:27:11,160
No it keeps making me make more meat.

3495
02:27:15,710 --> 02:27:17,290
I need two more sausages.

3496
02:27:17,690 --> 02:27:19,710
Where do I... do I... I'm gonna bring you with me.

3497
02:27:20,210 --> 02:27:22,030
Maybe if I bring you with me.

3498
02:27:23,730 --> 02:27:24,690
Okay no.

3499
02:27:25,130 --> 02:27:26,050
Okay no.

3500
02:27:26,530 --> 02:27:27,570
I'll go back up.

3501
02:27:27,790 --> 02:27:28,930
I'm gonna go back up.

3502
02:27:35,550 --> 02:27:36,890
I need one more.

3503
02:27:37,850 --> 02:27:39,230
Wait can I go over here?

3504
02:27:41,710 --> 02:27:42,230
Oh!

3505
02:27:46,880 --> 02:27:48,120
There's a little hole here.

3506
02:27:50,320 --> 02:27:51,060
Oh hey.

3507
02:27:51,720 --> 02:27:52,240
Uh.

3508
02:27:57,150 --> 02:27:57,790
We're in.

3509
02:27:59,790 --> 02:28:01,290
I'm so smart.

3510
02:28:02,610 --> 02:28:03,430
Look at that.

3511
02:28:03,870 --> 02:28:04,390
Oh.

3512
02:28:04,530 --> 02:28:07,090
What are you?

3513
02:28:07,430 --> 02:28:08,290
Oh shit.

3514
02:28:08,530 --> 02:28:09,630
Fucking foul.

3515
02:28:14,070 --> 02:28:15,530
Okay how do I get up here?

3516
02:28:17,390 --> 02:28:18,470
God damn it!

3517
02:28:19,790 --> 02:28:20,790
I'm so...

3518
02:28:20,790 --> 02:28:21,970
I'm so...

3519
02:28:21,970 --> 02:28:22,990
Okay.

3520
02:28:23,610 --> 02:28:23,890
Okay.

3521
02:28:24,890 --> 02:28:25,450
Please!

3522
02:28:28,870 --> 02:28:29,610
Let me up here!

3523
02:28:32,790 --> 02:28:34,570
I don't know how to get up!

3524
02:28:36,670 --> 02:28:37,230
Okay.

3525
02:28:40,210 --> 02:28:40,770
Okay.

3526
02:28:40,790 --> 02:28:40,850
Okay.

3527
02:28:40,850 --> 02:28:41,370
Okay that's not it.

3528
02:28:42,030 --> 02:28:42,590
Up.

3529
02:28:43,150 --> 02:28:43,710
Up.

3530
02:28:45,570 --> 02:28:46,990
Please let me up!

3531
02:28:50,500 --> 02:28:52,220
Let me up!

3532
02:28:53,200 --> 02:28:54,840
Please let me up!

3533
02:28:57,440 --> 02:28:58,900
How do I get up?

3534
02:29:03,450 --> 02:29:04,090
Zara!

3535
02:29:04,270 --> 02:29:06,170
Thank you so much for gifting us stuff to Acer!

3536
02:29:07,210 --> 02:29:07,850
Thank you!

3537
02:29:08,570 --> 02:29:08,710
Woo!

3538
02:29:09,030 --> 02:29:12,830
Can I get some bright nights real quick for...

3539
02:29:13,450 --> 02:29:13,770
for...

3540
02:29:15,810 --> 02:29:16,450
for...

3541
02:29:17,350 --> 02:29:18,610
Zara and Acer?

3542
02:29:18,750 --> 02:29:21,350
And that's a best time to eat while watching this.

3543
02:29:21,470 --> 02:29:21,790
I see.

3544
02:29:22,030 --> 02:29:22,670
It's okay.

3545
02:29:22,830 --> 02:29:23,670
God damn it!

3546
02:29:23,730 --> 02:29:24,210
Get me up!

3547
02:29:26,910 --> 02:29:27,390
Please!

3548
02:29:28,390 --> 02:29:29,570
Please let me up!

3549
02:29:29,710 --> 02:29:30,730
Let me up!

3550
02:29:32,470 --> 02:29:34,070
I don't know how to get up here!

3551
02:29:38,230 --> 02:29:38,710
Okay.

3552
02:29:38,810 --> 02:29:39,110
Okay.

3553
02:29:39,270 --> 02:29:40,350
I keep jumping.

3554
02:29:40,650 --> 02:29:41,130
Maybe...

3555
02:29:41,130 --> 02:29:42,170
Okay I... I... I...

3556
02:29:42,170 --> 02:29:45,490
Clearly jumping was not the...

3557
02:29:45,490 --> 02:29:46,950
was not the right idea.

3558
02:29:49,770 --> 02:29:50,250
Ow...!

3559
02:29:50,250 --> 02:29:51,410
How do we get up?

3560
02:29:52,110 --> 02:29:53,470
I'm... I'm angry.

3561
02:29:57,410 --> 02:29:57,890
Okay.

3562
02:29:57,890 --> 02:29:58,370
Maybe...

3563
02:29:59,030 --> 02:30:00,270
Maybe this will work again.

3564
02:30:00,350 --> 02:30:01,150
Maybe this will work.

3565
02:30:05,680 --> 02:30:06,160
Alright.

3566
02:30:08,260 --> 02:30:08,740
No.

3567
02:30:09,400 --> 02:30:09,880
Okay.

3568
02:30:10,600 --> 02:30:11,320
Now that...

3569
02:30:11,320 --> 02:30:11,980
The meat?

3570
02:30:12,220 --> 02:30:14,440
I can't get to this meat though.

3571
02:30:14,920 --> 02:30:16,000
There's no meat here.

3572
02:30:16,600 --> 02:30:18,520
Like, it won't let me pick up the meat here.

3573
02:30:19,600 --> 02:30:20,080
Ugh!

3574
02:30:20,640 --> 02:30:24,960
It won't let me pick up I'm trying to give up!

3575
02:30:25,580 --> 02:30:27,760
Let me make you into sausages!

3576
02:30:29,280 --> 02:30:31,320
Let me make you into sausages!

3577
02:30:32,040 --> 02:30:32,480
Fire!

3578
02:30:35,460 --> 02:30:36,620
Is it fire?

3579
02:30:37,260 --> 02:30:37,820
Fire?

3580
02:30:42,540 --> 02:30:43,800
I don't know what to do.

3581
02:30:45,700 --> 02:30:46,340
Okay, I give up.

3582
02:30:46,460 --> 02:30:47,560
Clearly this isn't it.

3583
02:30:47,940 --> 02:30:49,360
I don't think this is it, chat.

3584
02:30:49,360 --> 02:30:51,580
I don't think this was the right idea.

3585
02:30:54,920 --> 02:30:56,620
Wait, can I pull this?

3586
02:30:57,340 --> 02:30:58,320
Wait, is that me?

3587
02:30:58,580 --> 02:30:59,400
Wait, this is me!

3588
02:30:59,980 --> 02:31:01,320
You're fucking... you're all blind!

3589
02:31:01,760 --> 02:31:02,740
You're all blind!

3590
02:31:08,640 --> 02:31:09,740
We're all blind!

3591
02:31:10,140 --> 02:31:11,960
We're all fucking blind!

3592
02:31:12,320 --> 02:31:13,700
We're so stupid!

3593
02:31:15,920 --> 02:31:17,140
We're all stupid!

3594
02:31:24,740 --> 02:31:25,860
This wasn't...

3595
02:31:29,920 --> 02:31:32,640
We were all... We were all stupid.

3596
02:31:32,760 --> 02:31:33,180
It's okay.

3597
02:31:33,680 --> 02:31:34,240
NINTEND!

3598
02:31:34,660 --> 02:31:35,700
Oh my god!

3599
02:31:37,960 --> 02:31:39,000
Holy shit!

3600
02:31:39,660 --> 02:31:40,580
Holy shit!

3601
02:31:40,640 --> 02:31:42,380
Thank you so much for the raid!

3602
02:31:43,440 --> 02:31:44,320
Thank you!

3603
02:31:44,640 --> 02:31:46,120
I hope you had a good stream!

3604
02:31:46,240 --> 02:31:47,900
What were you... What were you streaming?

3605
02:31:48,580 --> 02:31:50,280
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

3606
02:31:50,340 --> 02:31:50,840
Hello everyone!

3607
02:31:51,320 --> 02:31:51,620
Hi!

3608
02:31:52,900 --> 02:31:54,360
We're playing Little Nightmares!

3609
02:31:54,860 --> 02:31:55,660
Thank you!

3610
02:31:55,760 --> 02:31:56,800
Thank you so much!

3611
02:31:57,800 --> 02:31:58,060
Thank you!

3612
02:31:58,060 --> 02:31:58,060
Thank you so much!

3613
02:31:58,060 --> 02:31:59,540
I hope you had a really good stream, Nintend!

3614
02:31:59,820 --> 02:32:01,860
Also, thank you so much for the follow, Sludgy Gamer!

3615
02:32:02,040 --> 02:32:04,060
And Unravel Persona, thank you, thank you.

3616
02:32:04,120 --> 02:32:05,680
Have a... Have a Bud Hearts!

3617
02:32:05,740 --> 02:32:07,020
Thank you so much, guys!

3618
02:32:07,220 --> 02:32:08,680
And Dutch Potato, thank you!

3619
02:32:08,820 --> 02:32:11,020
Okay, I'm trying to... Little Nightmares is so good, yeah!

3620
02:32:11,180 --> 02:32:13,040
We're using our brains right now.

3621
02:32:13,080 --> 02:32:16,260
We've been trying to find this last piece of meat for like 20 years!

3622
02:32:16,580 --> 02:32:17,080
And it...

3623
02:32:19,120 --> 02:32:20,580
It was right here!

3624
02:32:20,800 --> 02:32:21,860
It was looking... It was looking...

3625
02:32:21,880 --> 02:32:24,960
It was right here the last reason we didn't know.

3626
02:32:26,940 --> 02:32:28,860
So we were having some problems.

3627
02:32:28,980 --> 02:32:29,760
We were all stupid.

3628
02:32:29,960 --> 02:32:31,680
Chad and I were both stupid together.

3629
02:32:33,360 --> 02:32:34,760
Thank you so much for the follow.

3630
02:32:35,580 --> 02:32:36,940
Fish and Super Joshi.

3631
02:32:37,020 --> 02:32:37,600
Thank you, thank you.

3632
02:32:37,740 --> 02:32:39,660
Have some, have some buttharts.

3633
02:32:39,740 --> 02:32:40,580
Thank you, thank you.

3634
02:32:41,880 --> 02:32:42,660
I'm not blind.

3635
02:32:42,760 --> 02:32:44,120
I've seen the game before.

3636
02:32:46,640 --> 02:32:47,920
Everyone's like, yeah, just go up.

3637
02:32:48,080 --> 02:32:48,820
Just go up.

3638
02:32:48,880 --> 02:32:49,820
That's how you do it.

3639
02:32:49,820 --> 02:32:50,820
And I'm like, up?

3640
02:32:51,220 --> 02:32:51,760
Up?

3641
02:32:52,780 --> 02:32:57,280
I keep fucking trying to get up and it wasn't working.

3642
02:32:59,060 --> 02:33:00,500
All right, some sausages.

3643
02:33:00,580 --> 02:33:01,100
Let's go.

3644
02:33:02,020 --> 02:33:04,780
Yeah, you know, up.

3645
02:33:04,840 --> 02:33:05,380
Yeah, up.

3646
02:33:05,840 --> 02:33:09,320
Clearly I was at the wrong up.

3647
02:33:09,480 --> 02:33:09,860
Please.

3648
02:33:09,980 --> 02:33:10,820
Oh my god.

3649
02:33:11,040 --> 02:33:12,720
Oh, this isn't real true.

3650
02:33:16,200 --> 02:33:17,740
The movie's simple.

3651
02:33:21,860 --> 02:33:22,460
Oh, yeah.

3652
02:33:22,840 --> 02:33:23,280
Okay.

3653
02:33:25,080 --> 02:33:28,860
We've only been playing this game for like 20 minutes and already 90% done.

3654
02:33:29,040 --> 02:33:29,680
Isn't that crazy?

3655
02:33:30,700 --> 02:33:34,680
Guys, for all you new viewers out there, we're making a new world record.

3656
02:33:35,660 --> 02:33:39,920
Also, do not trust the timestamp of my stream because it's broken right now.

3657
02:33:39,940 --> 02:33:41,500
But I've only been playing it for 20 minutes.

3658
02:33:44,180 --> 02:33:45,300
Yeah, it's a speedrun.

3659
02:33:45,340 --> 02:33:46,420
I'm gonna fucking...

3660
02:33:46,940 --> 02:33:48,300
Guinness World Records right here.

3661
02:33:48,420 --> 02:33:49,020
Little nightmares.

3662
02:33:49,820 --> 02:33:50,300
First try.

3663
02:33:50,380 --> 02:33:50,960
Blind run.

3664
02:33:52,760 --> 02:33:53,960
Yeah, it's only 20 minutes.

3665
02:33:54,280 --> 02:33:55,140
But it says to... no, no.

3666
02:33:55,200 --> 02:33:58,940
It says... it's... it's... the zero... the zero is 23.

3667
02:33:59,060 --> 02:34:00,620
Sorry, I meant 23 minutes.

3668
02:34:01,040 --> 02:34:01,320
I...

3669
02:34:02,340 --> 02:34:04,220
The zero is at the wrong place.

3670
02:34:04,220 --> 02:34:05,040
It's bugged right now.

3671
02:34:06,740 --> 02:34:07,920
She has a 3D mod.

3672
02:34:07,980 --> 02:34:10,340
She's even using some kind of dice for hand cat...

3673
02:34:10,340 --> 02:34:12,040
Yeah, yeah, I have a hand tracker.

3674
02:34:13,000 --> 02:34:16,800
So, trying to convince you that you're better playing games than getting your emos done.

3675
02:34:16,860 --> 02:34:16,960
Yeah.

3676
02:34:17,520 --> 02:34:17,960
Yeah.

3677
02:34:18,240 --> 02:34:18,680
Perfect.

3678
02:34:18,680 --> 02:34:19,800
Where is this key?

3679
02:34:23,840 --> 02:34:24,280
Okay.

3680
02:34:24,380 --> 02:34:25,480
What the fuck am I doing?

3681
02:34:26,560 --> 02:34:27,340
Where's the key?

3682
02:34:29,600 --> 02:34:30,040
Look.

3683
02:34:30,060 --> 02:34:30,960
See this tech?

3684
02:34:31,060 --> 02:34:31,860
I'm bee-hopping.

3685
02:34:32,080 --> 02:34:34,900
This is some like... a speedrun tech right here.

3686
02:34:35,100 --> 02:34:36,020
My bee-hops.

3687
02:34:39,680 --> 02:34:40,360
Look at that.

3688
02:34:40,540 --> 02:34:40,840
Look at that.

3689
02:34:45,520 --> 02:34:47,360
Okay, where the hell the fuck do I...

3690
02:34:47,360 --> 02:34:48,820
Oh, there's a switch here.

3691
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:51,200
I was like...

3692
02:34:51,900 --> 02:34:52,720
I was like...

3693
02:34:52,720 --> 02:34:54,680
Where is the key?

3694
02:34:55,960 --> 02:34:56,460
OH!

3695
02:34:56,480 --> 02:34:57,060
WHAT THE FUCK!

3696
02:34:57,260 --> 02:34:57,760
WHOA!

3697
02:34:57,840 --> 02:34:58,100
WHOA!

3698
02:34:58,100 --> 02:34:58,400
WHOA!

3699
02:34:58,640 --> 02:34:59,160
GET OUT!

3700
02:35:02,160 --> 02:35:02,940
Oh, no!

3701
02:35:03,060 --> 02:35:03,300
No!

3702
02:35:03,340 --> 02:35:03,540
Oh, no!

3703
02:35:03,540 --> 02:35:03,540
No!

3704
02:35:03,540 --> 02:35:03,660
Oh, no!

3705
02:35:03,660 --> 02:35:03,660
No!

3706
02:35:07,000 --> 02:35:08,000
Oh, no!

3707
02:35:08,120 --> 02:35:08,620
No!

3708
02:35:08,620 --> 02:35:10,540
Yeah, but it's a broken tip.

3709
02:35:11,240 --> 02:35:11,740
Okay.

3710
02:35:11,980 --> 02:35:12,400
Alright.

3711
02:35:12,500 --> 02:35:13,500
Anyway, I was...

3712
02:35:13,500 --> 02:35:15,480
I was fucking... Anyway, what happened?

3713
02:35:15,520 --> 02:35:16,960
I passed out for a second.

3714
02:35:17,300 --> 02:35:17,800
Uh...

3715
02:35:22,720 --> 02:35:23,840
I don't know what happened.

3716
02:35:23,900 --> 02:35:24,320
I just...

3717
02:35:24,320 --> 02:35:24,780
I don't know what happened.

3718
02:35:24,780 --> 02:35:25,420
I just passed out for a second.

3719
02:35:25,480 --> 02:35:26,660
Anyway, this is a speedrun.

3720
02:35:28,180 --> 02:35:29,620
This is a speedrun, guys.

3721
02:35:32,400 --> 02:35:33,900
Oh, I'm running now.

3722
02:35:35,200 --> 02:35:36,140
I know now.

3723
02:35:36,380 --> 02:35:37,240
I know now.

3724
02:35:37,460 --> 02:35:38,160
I know now.

3725
02:35:40,360 --> 02:35:41,740
Can't see me, stupid.

3726
02:35:45,520 --> 02:35:45,980
Oh...

3727
02:35:46,780 --> 02:35:47,240
Oh...

3728
02:35:47,240 --> 02:35:47,780
Oh...

3729
02:35:47,780 --> 02:35:48,440
Get away!

3730
02:35:51,980 --> 02:35:53,100
Get away!

3731
02:35:53,100 --> 02:35:53,480
Jeez.

3732
02:35:57,780 --> 02:35:58,700
Please leave.

3733
02:35:59,280 --> 02:36:00,200
Please leave.

3734
02:36:00,900 --> 02:36:01,840
Please leave.

3735
02:36:02,920 --> 02:36:03,680
Please leave.

3736
02:36:06,480 --> 02:36:07,600
It's stupid.

3737
02:36:07,660 --> 02:36:07,680
It's stupid.

3738
02:36:10,520 --> 02:36:11,080
Yeah!

3739
02:36:11,640 --> 02:36:12,140
Yeah!

3740
02:36:19,720 --> 02:36:21,420
Oh, let me... let me through.

3741
02:36:21,520 --> 02:36:21,980
Let me through.

3742
02:36:22,100 --> 02:36:22,380
Wait!

3743
02:36:22,520 --> 02:36:22,800
Wait!

3744
02:36:22,920 --> 02:36:23,820
Why can't I get out?

3745
02:36:24,460 --> 02:36:25,020
Wait!

3746
02:36:25,020 --> 02:36:25,020
Why can't I get out?

3747
02:36:32,630 --> 02:36:33,310
Please!

3748
02:36:42,910 --> 02:36:44,010
Oh, my God.

3749
02:36:45,870 --> 02:36:46,930
Please leave.

3750
02:36:47,450 --> 02:36:48,450
Please leave.

3751
02:36:53,060 --> 02:36:53,740
Okay.

3752
02:36:53,860 --> 02:36:54,200
Okay.

3753
02:36:56,080 --> 02:36:57,320
He doesn't know.

3754
02:36:57,880 --> 02:36:59,260
He doesn't know.

3755
02:36:59,320 --> 02:37:01,240
He doesn't know.

3756
02:37:04,120 --> 02:37:04,340
Oh!

3757
02:37:07,500 --> 02:37:08,200
Is this...

3758
02:37:08,200 --> 02:37:09,660
Do you think... Do you think he can't see me?

3759
02:37:09,840 --> 02:37:13,060
If I hide here, he can't see me if I hide here?

3760
02:37:13,220 --> 02:37:14,920
If I hide here, he can't see me if I hide here?

3761
02:37:15,280 --> 02:37:16,780
I'm such a good speedrunner.

3762
02:37:16,880 --> 02:37:17,500
I am so fast.

3763
02:37:17,740 --> 02:37:18,240
Look at this.

3764
02:37:19,320 --> 02:37:20,080
Oh, gross.

3765
02:37:20,100 --> 02:37:20,680
That's disgusting.

3766
02:37:22,980 --> 02:37:24,140
He doesn't know.

3767
02:37:24,540 --> 02:37:25,260
He doesn't know.

3768
02:37:25,440 --> 02:37:25,840
Oh...

3769
02:37:27,720 --> 02:37:28,120
Oh...

3770
02:37:28,120 --> 02:37:28,680
Oh...

3771
02:37:28,680 --> 02:37:28,880
Oh!

3772
02:37:28,960 --> 02:37:29,340
Oh!

3773
02:37:33,440 --> 02:37:33,940
It's okay.

3774
02:37:34,180 --> 02:37:34,680
It's okay.

3775
02:37:36,160 --> 02:37:36,900
I'm okay.

3776
02:37:37,440 --> 02:37:37,700
I'm okay.

3777
02:37:38,940 --> 02:37:41,160
Thank you so much for the follow, Final Boss.

3778
02:37:41,260 --> 02:37:41,740
Thank you.

3779
02:37:43,760 --> 02:37:44,320
Oh, my God.

3780
02:37:45,340 --> 02:37:46,100
It's stupid.

3781
02:37:47,220 --> 02:37:47,980
Oh, my God.

3782
02:37:49,300 --> 02:37:49,680
Okay.

3783
02:37:51,380 --> 02:37:53,800
I don't know what his pattern is going to be.

3784
02:37:53,840 --> 02:37:55,060
I'm just going to look at him for a bit.

3785
02:37:55,420 --> 02:37:56,200
Just in case.

3786
02:37:56,200 --> 02:37:56,680
I need...

3787
02:37:56,680 --> 02:37:59,700
I don't want to go out right now.

3788
02:37:59,740 --> 02:38:00,420
I'm too scared.

3789
02:38:01,060 --> 02:38:03,400
I don't want to redo this whole thing.

3790
02:38:05,320 --> 02:38:07,160
I don't want to redo it.

3791
02:38:07,620 --> 02:38:09,420
He wants to do HR...

3792
02:38:09,980 --> 02:38:11,200
HR... stuff.

3793
02:38:11,560 --> 02:38:12,640
But extra meaty.

3794
02:38:13,260 --> 02:38:14,020
What's he doing?

3795
02:38:19,430 --> 02:38:20,790
Is he not going to turn around?

3796
02:38:21,190 --> 02:38:22,630
Oh, he's just going to keep chopping meat.

3797
02:38:22,730 --> 02:38:23,070
Okay.

3798
02:38:23,150 --> 02:38:24,310
I'm... I'm flying.

3799
02:38:28,490 --> 02:38:29,010
Bye.

3800
02:38:33,140 --> 02:38:34,320
Oh, I do the grinder.

3801
02:38:37,440 --> 02:38:37,940
Please.

3802
02:38:37,980 --> 02:38:38,240
No.

3803
02:38:38,340 --> 02:38:38,740
No, no, no.

3804
02:38:39,200 --> 02:38:39,700
Please.

3805
02:38:44,680 --> 02:38:45,980
Let me get the key.

3806
02:38:46,140 --> 02:38:47,100
Let me go.

3807
02:38:51,330 --> 02:38:52,750
Can't you run faster?

3808
02:38:53,090 --> 02:38:54,410
You little child.

3809
02:38:59,790 --> 02:39:00,290
Okay.

3810
02:39:04,130 --> 02:39:05,970
Please run faster, child.

3811
02:39:07,350 --> 02:39:08,350
Please.

3812
02:39:08,810 --> 02:39:09,810
Please.

3813
02:39:09,810 --> 02:39:11,230
Run faster.

3814
02:39:11,670 --> 02:39:12,910
The key.

3815
02:39:13,370 --> 02:39:14,290
Ah.

3816
02:39:18,090 --> 02:39:19,910
Child, please.

3817
02:39:20,990 --> 02:39:21,490
Oh.

3818
02:39:22,210 --> 02:39:23,670
He can't see me.

3819
02:39:24,010 --> 02:39:25,690
He doesn't know.

3820
02:39:29,670 --> 02:39:31,870
He doesn't know.

3821
02:39:31,890 --> 02:39:32,010
He doesn't know.

3822
02:39:32,010 --> 02:39:32,630
He's stupid.

3823
02:39:33,130 --> 02:39:34,350
You're stupid.

3824
02:39:34,690 --> 02:39:35,270
Please.

3825
02:39:35,870 --> 02:39:36,870
He's stupid.

3826
02:39:38,290 --> 02:39:39,290
He's stupid.

3827
02:39:39,310 --> 02:39:40,190
He doesn't know.

3828
02:39:40,830 --> 02:39:41,910
He doesn't know.

3829
02:39:44,530 --> 02:39:45,590
Holy shit.

3830
02:39:45,810 --> 02:39:46,410
Okay.

3831
02:39:46,590 --> 02:39:47,170
Alright.

3832
02:39:47,430 --> 02:39:47,950
Okay.

3833
02:39:48,070 --> 02:39:48,810
He didn't know.

3834
02:39:48,950 --> 02:39:50,110
He didn't know.

3835
02:39:52,990 --> 02:39:55,090
He likes critical information.

3836
02:39:55,710 --> 02:39:56,170
He likes critical information.

3837
02:39:56,170 --> 02:39:57,370
He's a fucking idiot.

3838
02:39:58,170 --> 02:39:58,810
He's a fucking idiot.

3839
02:40:00,390 --> 02:40:01,810
What do I do after?

3840
02:40:02,030 --> 02:40:02,850
I don't even...

3841
02:40:02,850 --> 02:40:04,070
What the fuck do I...

3842
02:40:04,070 --> 02:40:05,010
Oh, here.

3843
02:40:07,010 --> 02:40:07,610
Okay.

3844
02:40:10,090 --> 02:40:10,910
Look at that.

3845
02:40:11,090 --> 02:40:11,350
See?

3846
02:40:11,490 --> 02:40:12,190
Fucking easy.

3847
02:40:13,310 --> 02:40:14,210
So easy.

3848
02:40:14,470 --> 02:40:15,990
I wasn't scared at all.

3849
02:40:20,670 --> 02:40:21,950
What the fuck do I...

3850
02:40:21,950 --> 02:40:22,790
Is this a plunger?

3851
02:40:24,230 --> 02:40:24,970
Do I...

3852
02:40:24,970 --> 02:40:26,390
Do I pick you up?

3853
02:40:26,830 --> 02:40:28,210
What the fuck?

3854
02:40:29,130 --> 02:40:30,090
What the fuck?

3855
02:40:31,410 --> 02:40:32,310
Oh, I climb.

3856
02:40:33,570 --> 02:40:34,990
I'm my home.

3857
02:40:35,470 --> 02:40:35,990
Okay.

3858
02:40:36,050 --> 02:40:36,310
No.

3859
02:40:36,390 --> 02:40:37,370
That's not what I do.

3860
02:40:37,710 --> 02:40:39,410
What the fuck do I do here?

3861
02:40:42,470 --> 02:40:42,910
Oh.

3862
02:40:44,310 --> 02:40:45,010
I climb.

3863
02:40:45,970 --> 02:40:46,410
Oh.

3864
02:40:46,510 --> 02:40:46,850
Oh.

3865
02:40:46,930 --> 02:40:47,570
I do climb.

3866
02:40:47,670 --> 02:40:48,230
I do climb.

3867
02:40:48,370 --> 02:40:49,150
There's a hole here.

3868
02:40:50,170 --> 02:40:52,510
No, he freaks out and then he solves the date.

3869
02:40:54,870 --> 02:40:55,310
Okay.

3870
02:40:57,450 --> 02:40:57,890
Okay.

3871
02:41:01,570 --> 02:41:02,010
Alright.

3872
02:41:02,130 --> 02:41:03,970
I don't know what I'm supposed to do here now.

3873
02:41:04,650 --> 02:41:05,930
I'm just gonna...

3874
02:41:07,950 --> 02:41:08,930
He's doing dishes.

3875
02:41:09,410 --> 02:41:10,390
Oh, they are twins!

3876
02:41:10,590 --> 02:41:11,070
Look at that!

3877
02:41:11,930 --> 02:41:15,010
I told you guys!

3878
02:41:15,070 --> 02:41:16,730
That's why they had two toilets.

3879
02:41:17,150 --> 02:41:19,030
Because twins poop next to each other.

3880
02:41:19,210 --> 02:41:19,990
That's what twins do.

3881
02:41:23,390 --> 02:41:24,790
That's what this game taught me.

3882
02:41:29,280 --> 02:41:29,740
Oh.

3883
02:41:30,300 --> 02:41:31,520
I'm supposed to go here.

3884
02:41:37,110 --> 02:41:37,570
Oh.

3885
02:41:37,850 --> 02:41:38,310
Okay.

3886
02:41:38,370 --> 02:41:38,970
I have to...

3887
02:41:44,080 --> 02:41:45,280
Can I get out from here?

3888
02:41:52,940 --> 02:41:53,740
He doesn't know.

3889
02:41:53,840 --> 02:41:54,340
He doesn't know.

3890
02:41:56,560 --> 02:41:58,600
There's another stupid...

3891
02:41:58,600 --> 02:42:01,300
There's another stupid...

3892
02:42:03,300 --> 02:42:07,540
They know nothing.

3893
02:42:08,520 --> 02:42:09,940
I'm so confident.

3894
02:42:09,960 --> 02:42:12,200
I'm gonna drink some tea while I watch them.

3895
02:42:14,640 --> 02:42:17,200
I'm so confident.

3896
02:42:17,200 --> 02:42:18,460
They know nothing.

3897
02:42:18,820 --> 02:42:19,940
They don't know shit.

3898
02:42:23,000 --> 02:42:23,740
Stupid.

3899
02:42:23,740 --> 02:42:24,020
Stupid.

3900
02:42:25,900 --> 02:42:26,700
Okay, where do I...

3901
02:42:26,700 --> 02:42:26,920
Oh!

3902
02:42:27,000 --> 02:42:27,220
No!

3903
02:42:27,360 --> 02:42:27,600
No!

3904
02:42:31,180 --> 02:42:32,260
Oh, he doesn't know.

3905
02:42:32,420 --> 02:42:32,860
They don't know.

3906
02:42:33,000 --> 02:42:34,020
Like, you idiots.

3907
02:42:35,860 --> 02:42:37,680
I just ran through glass.

3908
02:42:38,040 --> 02:42:39,760
I was like, oh, fuck.

3909
02:42:41,680 --> 02:42:42,640
No, he doesn't know.

3910
02:42:49,560 --> 02:42:50,040
I can't.

3911
02:42:52,860 --> 02:42:53,720
I can't.

3912
02:42:55,280 --> 02:42:56,560
No, no, no, no.

3913
02:42:56,560 --> 02:42:58,060
No, no, no.

3914
02:43:00,320 --> 02:43:02,220
They can smell fear.

3915
02:43:02,520 --> 02:43:03,880
I hear nothing.

3916
02:43:04,220 --> 02:43:05,880
What are you guys talking about?

3917
02:43:06,000 --> 02:43:06,720
I don't feel shit.

3918
02:43:08,260 --> 02:43:08,860
Okay.

3919
02:43:15,300 --> 02:43:16,360
What does this do?

3920
02:43:16,360 --> 02:43:21,420
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...

3921
02:43:21,420 --> 02:43:22,780
Oh, oh...

3922
02:43:22,780 --> 02:43:23,180
Oh, oh, oh...

3923
02:43:23,180 --> 02:43:23,840
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...

3924
02:43:23,840 --> 02:43:26,820
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...

3925
02:43:26,820 --> 02:43:27,380
Oh, oh, oh...

3926
02:43:31,120 --> 02:43:32,420
Are you an idiot?

3927
02:43:32,960 --> 02:43:33,440
Are you an idiot?

3928
02:43:33,440 --> 02:43:34,380
Okay, what the fuck do I do after...?

3929
02:43:34,380 --> 02:43:34,580
Wait.

3930
02:43:34,720 --> 02:43:36,080
Why is he looking under the table?

3931
02:43:36,360 --> 02:43:37,620
You're not supposed to do that.

3932
02:43:41,060 --> 02:43:42,780
What do I do here after?

3933
02:43:54,510 --> 02:43:55,710
Can I go up?

3934
02:43:55,830 --> 02:43:56,230
Up!

3935
02:43:56,890 --> 02:43:57,370
Up!

3936
02:43:58,410 --> 02:43:58,970
Not up.

3937
02:43:58,970 --> 02:43:58,970
Not up.

3938
02:43:59,730 --> 02:44:00,290
What?

3939
02:44:00,450 --> 02:44:00,710
What?

3940
02:44:01,050 --> 02:44:01,770
How do I?

3941
02:44:03,910 --> 02:44:05,370
I'm so confused!

3942
02:44:06,230 --> 02:44:06,790
Here?

3943
02:44:09,150 --> 02:44:10,650
What the fuck?

3944
02:44:10,650 --> 02:44:12,670
What do you want me to do?

3945
02:44:12,850 --> 02:44:13,370
I...

3946
02:44:14,150 --> 02:44:15,450
I don't know what to do!

3947
02:44:20,270 --> 02:44:21,810
What do I do?

3948
02:44:21,810 --> 02:44:22,030
What do I do?

3949
02:44:25,150 --> 02:44:28,890
I just turned it on but now I don't know what's next after.

3950
02:44:29,450 --> 02:44:30,250
Uh huh.

3951
02:44:30,670 --> 02:44:31,470
The door?

3952
02:44:31,710 --> 02:44:32,330
Oh, door.

3953
02:44:32,650 --> 02:44:33,730
Wait, there's a door here.

3954
02:44:34,930 --> 02:44:35,670
Okay, okay.

3955
02:44:36,350 --> 02:44:37,110
Okay, okay.

3956
02:44:37,190 --> 02:44:37,730
We're waiting.

3957
02:44:38,150 --> 02:44:40,230
We're waiting for this freak to get out.

3958
02:44:41,050 --> 02:44:41,850
Please leave.

3959
02:44:42,510 --> 02:44:43,730
Please leave, mister.

3960
02:44:45,750 --> 02:44:48,170
Go back to the... in the other kitchen.

3961
02:44:48,310 --> 02:44:49,130
I don't trust!

3962
02:44:49,430 --> 02:44:51,170
I don't know if I can trust you guys.

3963
02:44:52,390 --> 02:44:52,830
Door!

3964
02:44:54,370 --> 02:44:54,810
Okay.

3965
02:44:54,810 --> 02:44:56,090
Okay, it was not the door.

3966
02:44:59,170 --> 02:45:01,030
Why won't it let me go up?

3967
02:45:02,790 --> 02:45:03,470
Wait, what?

3968
02:45:03,670 --> 02:45:04,730
I can turn it again?

3969
02:45:06,170 --> 02:45:07,110
What the fuck?

3970
02:45:09,490 --> 02:45:10,490
I'm so confused.

3971
02:45:11,930 --> 02:45:13,150
I'm so confused.

3972
02:45:21,110 --> 02:45:22,790
How do I get to the hooks though?

3973
02:45:23,570 --> 02:45:24,870
How do I get up to you?

3974
02:45:24,990 --> 02:45:25,970
You're so tall!

3975
02:45:28,590 --> 02:45:30,250
I don't wanna do this again!

3976
02:45:30,370 --> 02:45:31,030
I need to...

3977
02:45:34,340 --> 02:45:35,640
Okay, I gotta...

3978
02:45:36,700 --> 02:45:38,180
I'll make it past here.

3979
02:45:42,600 --> 02:45:43,200
I'll make it past here.

3980
02:45:43,200 --> 02:45:43,320
Stupid.

3981
02:45:45,600 --> 02:45:46,800
I'm gonna hide here.

3982
02:45:47,600 --> 02:45:48,200
I'm gonna hide here.

3983
02:45:49,000 --> 02:45:49,600
Okay.

3984
02:45:49,860 --> 02:45:50,460
Alright.

3985
02:45:50,700 --> 02:45:52,420
Where is this hook leading to?

3986
02:45:53,320 --> 02:45:53,920
Okay.

3987
02:45:55,000 --> 02:45:56,340
Oh, it's scary!

3988
02:45:56,340 --> 02:45:58,860
They think it's like a little bitzer hunt!

3989
02:45:59,040 --> 02:45:59,640
Okay.

3990
02:46:00,090 --> 02:46:00,420
Alright.

3991
02:46:00,700 --> 02:46:01,460
I'm looking.

3992
02:46:01,520 --> 02:46:02,260
I'm looking respectfully.

3993
02:46:02,840 --> 02:46:04,440
I'm looking respectfully!

3994
02:46:05,400 --> 02:46:06,800
The dish tower!

3995
02:46:07,100 --> 02:46:08,020
Oh, there's a dish tower.

3996
02:46:08,640 --> 02:46:11,200
I was like, what dish tower?

3997
02:46:12,820 --> 02:46:14,340
I'm looking respectfully!

3998
02:46:20,090 --> 02:46:21,110
Please leave.

3999
02:46:24,030 --> 02:46:24,690
Leave.

4000
02:46:25,930 --> 02:46:26,590
Leave!

4001
02:46:29,890 --> 02:46:30,790
Oh my god.

4002
02:46:31,870 --> 02:46:32,930
Oh my god.

4003
02:46:35,530 --> 02:46:37,450
Why you keep washing your dishes?

4004
02:46:39,170 --> 02:46:40,530
Just buying new plates?

4005
02:46:47,550 --> 02:46:48,350
How do I get up?

4006
02:46:48,690 --> 02:46:49,610
How do I go up?

4007
02:46:49,770 --> 02:46:50,470
I'm getting up.

4008
02:46:53,310 --> 02:46:53,750
No!

4009
02:46:53,750 --> 02:46:54,190
No!

4010
02:46:54,270 --> 02:46:54,670
Please!

4011
02:46:54,850 --> 02:46:55,210
Please!

4012
02:46:55,290 --> 02:46:55,670
Please!

4013
02:46:57,690 --> 02:46:58,130
Stupid!

4014
02:46:59,910 --> 02:47:00,850
You can't get me!

4015
02:47:00,850 --> 02:47:01,990
I don't know.

4016
02:47:07,830 --> 02:47:09,230
What you gonna do?

4017
02:47:09,490 --> 02:47:09,870
Huh?

4018
02:47:10,430 --> 02:47:11,910
What you gonna do?

4019
02:47:12,570 --> 02:47:13,290
Nothing.

4020
02:47:15,990 --> 02:47:16,710
Oh!

4021
02:47:16,910 --> 02:47:17,310
Wait!

4022
02:47:17,610 --> 02:47:18,050
Wait!

4023
02:47:19,590 --> 02:47:20,310
No!

4024
02:47:21,510 --> 02:47:22,130
No!

4025
02:47:22,610 --> 02:47:23,330
No!

4026
02:47:23,870 --> 02:47:24,590
He

4027
02:47:28,070 --> 02:47:29,630
doesn't know.

4028
02:47:29,690 --> 02:47:30,710
He doesn't know.

4029
02:47:32,430 --> 02:47:33,150
Wait!

4030
02:47:35,790 --> 02:47:36,250
Wait!

4031
02:47:38,010 --> 02:47:38,570
What!

4032
02:47:38,570 --> 02:47:39,110
What!

4033
02:47:40,810 --> 02:47:42,110
That's freaking idiot!

4034
02:47:45,310 --> 02:47:46,970
That's so good...

4035
02:47:49,090 --> 02:47:51,830
That's so good...

4036
02:47:51,830 --> 02:47:52,650
That's so good...

4037
02:47:52,650 --> 02:47:52,750
That's great...

4038
02:47:53,590 --> 02:47:54,150
That's great...

4039
02:47:54,150 --> 02:47:55,630
Did he put a bottle on you?

4040
02:47:55,770 --> 02:47:55,890
Did he put a bottle on you?

4041
02:47:57,870 --> 02:48:02,110
The fear of trying to do that again The fear of trying to do that again Made me fucking love...

4042
02:48:02,110 --> 02:48:04,070
Made me like speedrun that shit.

4043
02:48:04,210 --> 02:48:05,630
I did not want to do that again.

4044
02:48:06,850 --> 02:48:07,330
What is it?

4045
02:48:07,390 --> 02:48:08,850
I did not want to wait again.

4046
02:48:09,170 --> 02:48:12,350
I didn't want to fucking wait and hide again.

4047
02:48:15,810 --> 02:48:18,010
Why wash dishes when you just buy new ones?

4048
02:48:18,090 --> 02:48:18,490
Exactly!

4049
02:48:19,190 --> 02:48:19,710
Exactly!

4050
02:48:20,650 --> 02:48:22,850
You know what the biggest brain is?

4051
02:48:22,930 --> 02:48:25,910
Just buy paper plates and then recycle them when you're done.

4052
02:48:26,390 --> 02:48:28,010
Like, you never have to do dishes.

4053
02:48:28,150 --> 02:48:30,430
You just recycle your plates afterwards.

4054
02:48:30,710 --> 02:48:31,650
Isn't that so smart?

4055
02:48:40,370 --> 02:48:41,150
Look at that.

4056
02:48:41,350 --> 02:48:42,330
I'm bee hopping.

4057
02:48:42,530 --> 02:48:43,090
I'm bee hopping.

4058
02:48:45,850 --> 02:48:49,510
That run felt like a Super Bowl touchdown run.

4059
02:48:58,790 --> 02:48:59,910
Holy shit.

4060
02:49:00,130 --> 02:49:01,090
Convenient ladder.

4061
02:49:01,230 --> 02:49:02,050
No, right?

4062
02:49:04,010 --> 02:49:05,130
That seagull?

4063
02:49:05,490 --> 02:49:06,690
Holy shit!

4064
02:49:07,790 --> 02:49:08,830
Is that land?

4065
02:49:08,970 --> 02:49:09,950
Oh no, that's just boats.

4066
02:49:10,970 --> 02:49:11,810
Look at them.

4067
02:49:12,150 --> 02:49:12,810
Look at them.

4068
02:49:14,550 --> 02:49:15,370
Look at it.

4069
02:49:15,370 --> 02:49:16,130
That's a boat.

4070
02:49:16,510 --> 02:49:17,890
And then another boat.

4071
02:49:19,270 --> 02:49:20,210
There they go.

4072
02:49:20,630 --> 02:49:21,570
Look at them.

4073
02:49:22,630 --> 02:49:23,770
Look at the cattle.

4074
02:49:31,030 --> 02:49:33,330
I was trying to get him onto it.

4075
02:49:36,350 --> 02:49:39,950
How was I supposed to know I did it?

4076
02:49:40,190 --> 02:49:40,450
Okay.

4077
02:49:41,050 --> 02:49:43,070
Please let me get him onto it.

4078
02:49:43,970 --> 02:49:48,270
Where the fuck am I supposed to go?

4079
02:49:53,870 --> 02:49:54,270
Okay.

4080
02:49:54,590 --> 02:49:54,990
Okay.

4081
02:49:55,150 --> 02:49:55,550
Clearly.

4082
02:49:55,610 --> 02:49:55,890
Wait.

4083
02:49:55,950 --> 02:49:56,170
Okay.

4084
02:49:56,230 --> 02:49:57,030
This time I can do it.

4085
02:49:59,230 --> 02:49:59,630
Okay.

4086
02:49:59,710 --> 02:50:00,010
Maybe.

4087
02:50:00,850 --> 02:50:01,250
Wait.

4088
02:50:01,310 --> 02:50:01,450
No.

4089
02:50:01,530 --> 02:50:03,210
I know you're supposed to touch this.

4090
02:50:03,790 --> 02:50:04,990
What else are you supposed to do?

4091
02:50:05,010 --> 02:50:05,210
See?

4092
02:50:05,670 --> 02:50:06,770
I just didn't know.

4093
02:50:06,790 --> 02:50:08,550
I just didn't know my directions.

4094
02:50:14,110 --> 02:50:16,050
I was just blind.

4095
02:50:16,210 --> 02:50:17,230
I don't fucking know.

4096
02:50:19,150 --> 02:50:21,970
I just didn't know my directions clearly.

4097
02:50:28,380 --> 02:50:28,900
Here.

4098
02:50:29,120 --> 02:50:30,280
I'm so... Holy shit!

4099
02:50:30,300 --> 02:50:31,380
How big is this ship?

4100
02:50:33,440 --> 02:50:35,080
I think it's a big ass boat.

4101
02:50:39,440 --> 02:50:40,480
Dead Procession.

4102
02:50:40,700 --> 02:50:40,960
Yeah.

4103
02:50:44,120 --> 02:50:44,900
Oh look.

4104
02:50:44,940 --> 02:50:45,680
There's a seagull.

4105
02:50:45,980 --> 02:50:46,600
Hey there.

4106
02:50:46,960 --> 02:50:48,860
Look at the size of a seagull.

4107
02:50:54,570 --> 02:50:55,350
Look at him.

4108
02:50:58,370 --> 02:50:59,650
Look at him over there.

4109
02:50:59,850 --> 02:51:00,230
Ha!

4110
02:51:02,030 --> 02:51:02,710
Look at him.

4111
02:51:07,760 --> 02:51:08,520
Jesus Christ.

4112
02:51:09,200 --> 02:51:10,020
They're big boys.

4113
02:51:14,320 --> 02:51:15,740
They're like big boys.

4114
02:51:25,140 --> 02:51:26,200
Where the fuck is this game?

4115
02:51:26,240 --> 02:51:26,360
Dude.

4116
02:51:26,400 --> 02:51:26,960
I don't even know.

4117
02:51:27,180 --> 02:51:28,260
I don't even know.

4118
02:51:28,740 --> 02:51:29,120
Farseer.

4119
02:51:29,500 --> 02:51:33,380
I've... We've been playing this game for like 20 minutes and I still don't know.

4120
02:51:33,620 --> 02:51:34,940
I still don't know what we're doing.

4121
02:51:37,760 --> 02:51:38,140
I...

4122
02:51:54,070 --> 02:51:55,850
I jumped and freaked out.

4123
02:51:55,990 --> 02:51:59,110
Because I didn't know there was shit below me.

4124
02:52:01,710 --> 02:52:03,190
Speedrunner skipping the cut...

4125
02:52:03,190 --> 02:52:03,950
Wait there were cutscenes?

4126
02:52:04,470 --> 02:52:06,290
No it was just like a fucking chonkers.

4127
02:52:07,070 --> 02:52:07,930
Look at them.

4128
02:52:08,170 --> 02:52:09,350
Look at these chonkers.

4129
02:52:11,350 --> 02:52:13,090
Almost detect to far.

4130
02:52:15,850 --> 02:52:18,450
There's a really good theory I still won't share because spoilers.

4131
02:52:18,890 --> 02:52:20,670
It's been 20 minutes, 30 minutes ago.

4132
02:52:22,290 --> 02:52:24,650
Sorry I meant 23 minutes.

4133
02:52:25,190 --> 02:52:25,710
Sorry.

4134
02:52:25,830 --> 02:52:27,510
I meant 23 minutes guys.

4135
02:52:27,750 --> 02:52:30,790
I've been playing this game for 23 minutes and I still don't know what we're doing.

4136
02:52:35,630 --> 02:52:36,890
Oh shit look at her.

4137
02:52:37,770 --> 02:52:39,950
She's the only non-chonky one.

4138
02:52:40,930 --> 02:52:42,810
No, no, no, no, no, no.

4139
02:52:42,810 --> 02:52:43,070
No!

4140
02:52:45,930 --> 02:52:48,190
I was too busy looking at her.

4141
02:52:54,210 --> 02:52:56,090
Thank you socials for following me.

4142
02:52:56,170 --> 02:52:56,990
Thank you.

4143
02:52:57,630 --> 02:52:58,590
Have a butter.

4144
02:52:58,730 --> 02:52:59,530
Thank you.

4145
02:52:59,590 --> 02:53:00,090
Thank you.

4146
02:53:03,230 --> 02:53:03,790
I'm sorry.

4147
02:53:03,890 --> 02:53:05,830
I blinked for a second.

4148
02:53:06,470 --> 02:53:08,090
I blinked for a second chat.

4149
02:53:08,230 --> 02:53:08,590
I'm sorry.

4150
02:53:08,870 --> 02:53:10,290
So anyway I haven't died yet.

4151
02:53:10,350 --> 02:53:10,790
I was just blinking.

4152
02:53:11,770 --> 02:53:13,890
No, no, no, no, no!

4153
02:53:16,950 --> 02:53:17,710
Oh shit.

4154
02:53:17,730 --> 02:53:18,190
Sorry chat.

4155
02:53:18,410 --> 02:53:19,870
I passed out for a second.

4156
02:53:19,890 --> 02:53:20,550
What happened?

4157
02:53:20,550 --> 02:53:21,450
I don't know what happened.

4158
02:53:21,610 --> 02:53:23,290
Anyway, zero deaths.

4159
02:53:23,510 --> 02:53:25,390
I passed out for a second.

4160
02:53:25,870 --> 02:53:27,530
Anyway, sorry about that.

4161
02:53:29,290 --> 02:53:30,710
I keep forgetting.

4162
02:53:31,130 --> 02:53:37,310
I'm trying to do bee hopping and I keep forgetting that there's like a gap here.

4163
02:53:42,840 --> 02:53:43,480
Okay.

4164
02:53:44,260 --> 02:53:45,560
Alright, alright, alright.

4165
02:53:46,040 --> 02:53:47,860
I was distracted by girl.

4166
02:53:48,060 --> 02:53:50,360
Yeah, girl distracted me.

4167
02:53:54,860 --> 02:53:56,040
Do I get up here?

4168
02:53:56,120 --> 02:53:56,740
Do I get up here?

4169
02:53:57,680 --> 02:53:58,740
Oh, I get up here.

4170
02:54:01,220 --> 02:54:02,480
Look at them chonkers.

4171
02:54:03,760 --> 02:54:05,080
Look at them chonkers.

4172
02:54:07,440 --> 02:54:08,160
Oh lady.

4173
02:54:09,840 --> 02:54:10,200
Boom!

4174
02:54:10,200 --> 02:54:11,560
Dude, look at the speedrun!

4175
02:54:12,860 --> 02:54:13,540
Look at that!

4176
02:54:13,660 --> 02:54:14,520
I'm gonna look at them too.

4177
02:54:14,600 --> 02:54:15,400
Oh, where are they going?

4178
02:54:18,580 --> 02:54:19,400
Where are you going?

4179
02:54:21,180 --> 02:54:22,800
Damn, look at the wrinkles down there.

4180
02:54:25,780 --> 02:54:27,980
They're the one rocking the ship.

4181
02:54:28,480 --> 02:54:29,160
True.

4182
02:54:35,060 --> 02:54:36,580
Oh shit, they're eating.

4183
02:54:42,640 --> 02:54:43,760
What the fuck?

4184
02:54:43,800 --> 02:54:44,740
He looks like a rat.

4185
02:54:48,700 --> 02:54:50,400
Look at him.

4186
02:54:50,840 --> 02:54:52,160
Prepare to run?

4187
02:54:53,640 --> 02:54:54,320
What?

4188
02:54:54,620 --> 02:54:55,300
No!

4189
02:54:55,880 --> 02:54:57,320
I don't wanna run again.

4190
02:54:57,980 --> 02:54:58,660
No!

4191
02:55:00,140 --> 02:55:00,620
Oh!

4192
02:55:00,780 --> 02:55:01,060
Oh!

4193
02:55:01,140 --> 02:55:01,460
Oh!

4194
02:55:04,050 --> 02:55:04,050
Oh!

4195
02:55:04,070 --> 02:55:04,450
Please!

4196
02:55:04,710 --> 02:55:04,970
Oh!

4197
02:55:11,680 --> 02:55:12,740
Where do I go?

4198
02:55:13,040 --> 02:55:13,980
Where do I go?

4199
02:55:14,180 --> 02:55:14,600
Oh wait, up!

4200
02:55:14,600 --> 02:55:15,300
Up, up, up, up, up!

4201
02:55:19,100 --> 02:55:20,920
Up, up, up, up, up, up!

4202
02:55:22,300 --> 02:55:23,260
Fucking idiot.

4203
02:55:23,640 --> 02:55:24,600
Hey, what the fuck?

4204
02:55:27,640 --> 02:55:30,480
Oh, you fucked up so bad you still live.

4205
02:55:30,780 --> 02:55:30,880
Oh, you fucked up so bad you still live.

4206
02:55:30,880 --> 02:55:31,460
I know.

4207
02:55:31,460 --> 02:55:33,780
I don't know how the fuck I survived that.

4208
02:55:34,020 --> 02:55:35,920
I don't know how the fuck I survived that.

4209
02:55:37,100 --> 02:55:37,660
Stupid.

4210
02:55:37,960 --> 02:55:38,960
What you gonna do?

4211
02:55:38,980 --> 02:55:39,560
Grab me?

4212
02:55:41,080 --> 02:55:43,100
Oh my god, please don't grab me.

4213
02:55:43,160 --> 02:55:44,260
Please don't grab me.

4214
02:55:47,800 --> 02:55:48,360
Oh!

4215
02:55:48,360 --> 02:55:49,520
Oh my god!

4216
02:55:50,020 --> 02:55:50,580
Oh!

4217
02:55:51,420 --> 02:55:51,420
Oh my god!

4218
02:55:51,420 --> 02:55:51,420
Oh!

4219
02:55:51,420 --> 02:55:51,480
Oh my god!

4220
02:55:51,520 --> 02:55:52,440
Fucking idiot.

4221
02:55:55,080 --> 02:55:56,120
What do I do here?

4222
02:55:57,800 --> 02:55:58,700
What do I do here?

4223
02:55:58,700 --> 02:55:58,940
What do I do here?

4224
02:55:58,940 --> 02:56:00,260
Don't eat the walking cheese.

4225
02:56:00,920 --> 02:56:01,480
Don't eat the walking cheese.

4226
02:56:05,060 --> 02:56:06,680
I'm trying to figure out what to do here.

4227
02:56:06,920 --> 02:56:09,980
Cause I don't wanna go climb that and then get fucking eaten.

4228
02:56:14,960 --> 02:56:15,920
What the fuck?

4229
02:56:16,180 --> 02:56:16,300
What the fuck?

4230
02:56:16,300 --> 02:56:17,220
Did that chair move?

4231
02:56:20,240 --> 02:56:21,100
Is it here?

4232
02:56:21,480 --> 02:56:21,500
Is it here?

4233
02:56:27,780 --> 02:56:28,640
What am I doing?

4234
02:56:29,800 --> 02:56:31,660
What am I doing?

4235
02:56:32,280 --> 02:56:32,420
What am I doing?

4236
02:56:32,420 --> 02:56:32,840
What am I doing?

4237
02:56:32,840 --> 02:56:38,800
What am I doing?

4238
02:56:38,800 --> 02:56:39,400
What the fuck?

4239
02:56:40,000 --> 02:56:41,440
I'm just so entertaining.

4240
02:56:41,880 --> 02:56:44,100
Misa, thank you so 100,000 fans.

4241
02:56:44,660 --> 02:56:45,680
Thank you.

4242
02:56:46,040 --> 02:56:47,580
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

4243
02:56:50,000 --> 02:56:50,760
Are you good?

4244
02:56:52,560 --> 02:56:54,200
Glad you're enjoying this stream.

4245
02:56:54,640 --> 02:56:56,140
Misa, I'm glad, I'm glad.

4246
02:57:03,080 --> 02:57:03,640
Okay.

4247
02:57:06,600 --> 02:57:07,980
Where do I go though?

4248
02:57:08,040 --> 02:57:08,700
That's the thing.

4249
02:57:10,000 --> 02:57:10,900
Let me up!

4250
02:57:11,880 --> 02:57:12,700
Let me up!

4251
02:57:12,860 --> 02:57:14,460
Okay, clearly that's not it.

4252
02:57:20,960 --> 02:57:21,440
Okay.

4253
02:57:27,870 --> 02:57:29,670
Gotta run down the table, huh?

4254
02:57:30,530 --> 02:57:31,970
Wait, why is there a chair here?

4255
02:57:32,370 --> 02:57:33,090
Oh, stupid.

4256
02:57:33,710 --> 02:57:34,750
I just pushed the chair.

4257
02:57:37,050 --> 02:57:38,370
Oh, never mind.

4258
02:57:38,430 --> 02:57:39,170
That was a dead end.

4259
02:57:39,350 --> 02:57:40,910
That was a dead end.

4260
02:57:41,150 --> 02:57:43,550
That was just a stupid fucking achievement.

4261
02:57:44,030 --> 02:57:45,010
Oh, I hugged?

4262
02:57:45,090 --> 02:57:45,230
I hugged him!

4263
02:57:46,390 --> 02:57:47,370
What the fuck?

4264
02:57:47,610 --> 02:57:48,650
Why do I need to hug you?

4265
02:57:48,870 --> 02:57:49,790
Can I throw you off?

4266
02:57:53,230 --> 02:57:54,110
I'm just gonna...

4267
02:57:54,850 --> 02:57:55,930
I'm just gonna give it to you.

4268
02:57:56,810 --> 02:57:57,830
I'm bringing you with me.

4269
02:57:59,790 --> 02:58:00,970
I'm bringing you with me.

4270
02:58:01,710 --> 02:58:02,370
I'm bringing you with me.

4271
02:58:04,470 --> 02:58:05,310
I'm bringing you with me.

4272
02:58:05,990 --> 02:58:07,010
Wait, I can feed him?

4273
02:58:07,350 --> 02:58:08,250
I'm gonna feed him.

4274
02:58:15,680 --> 02:58:16,100
But...

4275
02:58:16,100 --> 02:58:17,780
Oh, I can't feed him.

4276
02:58:17,780 --> 02:58:20,100
Alright, I guess you're just gonna watch me die.

4277
02:58:20,500 --> 02:58:22,380
I guess you're just gonna watch me die.

4278
02:58:22,660 --> 02:58:24,260
I'm a fucking random ass.

4279
02:58:24,520 --> 02:58:24,960
No.

4280
02:58:31,400 --> 02:58:31,840
Wait.

4281
02:58:33,300 --> 02:58:34,140
Let me up.

4282
02:58:35,080 --> 02:58:35,800
Let me up!

4283
02:58:38,040 --> 02:58:38,480
Okay.

4284
02:58:39,580 --> 02:58:40,340
What do I do?

4285
02:58:40,620 --> 02:58:41,960
Thank you so much for the follow!

4286
02:58:42,380 --> 02:58:44,120
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

4287
02:58:44,180 --> 02:58:45,180
I do appreciate it.

4288
02:58:45,220 --> 02:58:45,900
Have a good heart.

4289
02:58:46,040 --> 02:58:46,460
Thank you.

4290
02:58:46,900 --> 02:58:48,000
Climb the chair maybe?

4291
02:58:48,640 --> 02:58:49,760
Ha ha ha ha.

4292
02:58:53,960 --> 02:58:54,860
Like an idiot.

4293
02:58:58,380 --> 02:58:59,380
Look at him!

4294
02:58:59,840 --> 02:59:00,660
Look at him.

4295
02:59:01,920 --> 02:59:04,980
He just eats it and then- and then it comes back out.

4296
02:59:05,140 --> 02:59:05,720
Look at that.

4297
02:59:08,820 --> 02:59:10,160
Do do do do do!

4298
02:59:10,160 --> 02:59:11,000
Do do do do!

4299
02:59:11,500 --> 02:59:11,700
Ah!

4300
02:59:11,940 --> 02:59:12,140
Ah!

4301
02:59:13,020 --> 02:59:13,460
Okay,

4302
02:59:16,660 --> 02:59:17,240
that wasn't it.

4303
02:59:17,380 --> 02:59:18,120
That wasn't it.

4304
02:59:21,400 --> 02:59:23,080
Okay, anyway, here we go again.

4305
02:59:25,160 --> 02:59:26,120
Here we go again.

4306
02:59:28,340 --> 02:59:30,440
I'm supposed to dodge them while trying.

4307
02:59:32,940 --> 02:59:33,500
Look at that.

4308
02:59:33,560 --> 02:59:34,740
Oh, maybe if I do bee hops.

4309
02:59:34,860 --> 02:59:35,600
I'm gonna do bee hops.

4310
02:59:36,060 --> 02:59:36,860
That's it, that's it.

4311
02:59:36,900 --> 02:59:37,740
We're gonna use the tech.

4312
02:59:37,880 --> 02:59:38,740
We're gonna use the...

4313
02:59:39,980 --> 02:59:42,160
the little nightmares tech that we learned.

4314
02:59:42,960 --> 02:59:43,600
Look at this.

4315
02:59:44,200 --> 02:59:44,760
Look at that.

4316
02:59:45,660 --> 02:59:46,020
Yeah!

4317
02:59:46,220 --> 02:59:46,460
Oh!

4318
02:59:46,700 --> 02:59:47,300
This is it!

4319
02:59:47,300 --> 02:59:47,980
This is it!

4320
02:59:48,780 --> 02:59:49,340
No!

4321
02:59:49,520 --> 02:59:50,340
This wasn't it!

4322
02:59:50,980 --> 02:59:52,120
This wasn't it!

4323
02:59:53,360 --> 02:59:53,920
No!

4324
02:59:55,000 --> 02:59:56,440
We're so close!

4325
02:59:57,800 --> 02:59:59,620
The bee hop tech!

4326
03:00:00,480 --> 03:00:02,040
We're so close!

4327
03:00:05,500 --> 03:00:07,080
We know what to do now.

4328
03:00:07,220 --> 03:00:08,000
We know what to do.

4329
03:00:08,020 --> 03:00:08,880
It's the bee hops.

4330
03:00:09,100 --> 03:00:10,260
It's the bee hops.

4331
03:00:10,540 --> 03:00:11,200
Zero deaths.

4332
03:00:11,300 --> 03:00:11,720
Zero deaths.

4333
03:00:12,020 --> 03:00:12,880
Zero deaths.

4334
03:00:14,400 --> 03:00:17,280
Yeah, it's been 24 minutes and we haven't died yet.

4335
03:00:17,380 --> 03:00:18,580
Isn't that crazy, guys?

4336
03:00:19,000 --> 03:00:19,640
You think?

4337
03:00:19,900 --> 03:00:20,420
Yeah.

4338
03:00:20,680 --> 03:00:21,200
Yeah!

4339
03:00:21,680 --> 03:00:22,200
Yeah!

4340
03:00:22,320 --> 03:00:22,840
Yeah!

4341
03:00:23,040 --> 03:00:23,560
Yeah!

4342
03:00:24,100 --> 03:00:24,620
Yeah!

4343
03:00:24,660 --> 03:00:25,180
Yeah!

4344
03:00:25,180 --> 03:00:25,600
Yeah!

4345
03:00:25,600 --> 03:00:25,640
Yeah!

4346
03:00:26,180 --> 03:00:26,700
Yeah!

4347
03:00:27,040 --> 03:00:28,020
Look at that!

4348
03:00:28,640 --> 03:00:29,540
Oh, shit!

4349
03:00:29,880 --> 03:00:32,240
I knew learning bee hops was gonna save me.

4350
03:00:33,860 --> 03:00:34,660
Look at that.

4351
03:00:38,820 --> 03:00:40,420
That's what you have to do, just bee hop.

4352
03:00:40,980 --> 03:00:43,720
That's what you have to do, just bee hop.

4353
03:00:43,720 --> 03:00:45,580
That's amazing.

4354
03:00:45,900 --> 03:00:47,820
Can't believe how amazing, pretty, and incredible you are.

4355
03:00:47,900 --> 03:00:48,180
I know!

4356
03:00:48,300 --> 03:00:49,400
Isn't that crazy, guys?

4357
03:00:50,440 --> 03:00:52,960
That was a pretty cash money move of you.

4358
03:00:55,400 --> 03:00:56,780
That's what bee hop taught me.

4359
03:00:57,160 --> 03:00:59,160
I knew bee hopping would be...

4360
03:00:59,160 --> 03:01:00,760
would help me sooner or later.

4361
03:01:01,600 --> 03:01:02,560
I knew it.

4362
03:01:02,720 --> 03:01:03,560
Can I eat my bread?

4363
03:01:04,580 --> 03:01:05,560
You're always hungry.

4364
03:01:05,720 --> 03:01:06,280
Just eat now.

4365
03:01:07,340 --> 03:01:11,880
Well, when he had... when he had... when she had food, she fucking doesn't eat it.

4366
03:01:11,920 --> 03:01:12,920
I'm a spoiled bitch.

4367
03:01:16,320 --> 03:01:20,000
You kept, like, starving and eating, like, live rats and everything, too.

4368
03:01:21,460 --> 03:01:23,880
And now that she has real food, she's like, no.

4369
03:01:26,440 --> 03:01:27,080
Fucking oh.

4370
03:01:34,620 --> 03:01:39,760
Dude, this ASMR of, like, them eating is like... I don't know how I feel about it.

4371
03:01:39,840 --> 03:01:40,380
They're like...

4372
03:01:41,480 --> 03:01:42,480
It's like ASMR.

4373
03:01:47,510 --> 03:01:50,090
This game makes me many things hungry.

4374
03:01:50,170 --> 03:01:51,450
It's not one of them.

4375
03:01:53,070 --> 03:01:54,070
Can I go over here?

4376
03:01:54,770 --> 03:01:55,410
Oh, shit.

4377
03:01:55,430 --> 03:01:56,210
I can go over here.

4378
03:01:56,510 --> 03:01:57,850
What am I gonna do here, though?

4379
03:01:58,790 --> 03:02:00,310
What does he want me to do here?

4380
03:02:01,710 --> 03:02:02,150
Whoa!

4381
03:02:02,230 --> 03:02:02,510
Wait!

4382
03:02:02,610 --> 03:02:02,850
Wait!

4383
03:02:02,970 --> 03:02:04,430
I don't wanna be here anymore!

4384
03:02:04,650 --> 03:02:05,890
I don't wanna be here anymore!

4385
03:02:06,110 --> 03:02:07,830
I don't wanna be here anymore!

4386
03:02:24,010 --> 03:02:24,490
Please!

4387
03:02:24,650 --> 03:02:25,070
Please!

4388
03:02:25,110 --> 03:02:25,450
Let me!

4389
03:02:25,570 --> 03:02:26,070
Let me!

4390
03:02:26,150 --> 03:02:26,630
Let me go!

4391
03:02:29,190 --> 03:02:30,150
You idiot.

4392
03:02:32,890 --> 03:02:33,370
Stupid.

4393
03:02:38,330 --> 03:02:39,570
Do I jump over him?

4394
03:02:43,110 --> 03:02:44,890
Oh my god, why are you so fast?

4395
03:02:44,890 --> 03:02:46,490
That procession.

4396
03:02:52,460 --> 03:02:53,380
Okay.

4397
03:02:53,380 --> 03:02:54,940
Oh, no.

4398
03:02:55,400 --> 03:02:55,960
No!

4399
03:02:56,620 --> 03:02:57,340
No!

4400
03:02:57,420 --> 03:02:58,640
Not you!

4401
03:02:59,260 --> 03:03:00,460
Not you!

4402
03:03:00,920 --> 03:03:02,400
Leave me alone!

4403
03:03:03,260 --> 03:03:04,720
Leave me alone!

4404
03:03:05,900 --> 03:03:07,220
Get out of here.

4405
03:03:07,320 --> 03:03:08,000
Toilet!

4406
03:03:09,720 --> 03:03:10,940
He doesn't know.

4407
03:03:17,220 --> 03:03:17,960
Leave me alone!

4408
03:03:24,770 --> 03:03:25,690
Toilet paper.

4409
03:03:40,150 --> 03:03:43,210
TP, I need to hug it for comfort.

4410
03:03:45,510 --> 03:03:47,090
Okay, I have to go up here.

4411
03:03:47,590 --> 03:03:48,450
How do I?

4412
03:03:49,430 --> 03:03:50,610
How do I go up?

4413
03:03:51,190 --> 03:03:53,150
Okay, not like that.

4414
03:03:54,510 --> 03:03:57,050
True horrors if he starts pooping.

4415
03:03:57,070 --> 03:03:57,750
Oh my god.

4416
03:03:58,190 --> 03:04:01,190
I do not need that ASMR right now.

4417
03:04:01,290 --> 03:04:04,770
I do not need the poop ASMR from this game.

4418
03:04:11,920 --> 03:04:12,980
How do they flush?

4419
03:04:13,520 --> 03:04:15,100
They don't have any flushers.

4420
03:04:16,300 --> 03:04:19,080
Pull a Banjo-Kazooie and go down the toilet tree.

4421
03:04:23,540 --> 03:04:24,080
Oh!

4422
03:04:24,280 --> 03:04:25,620
He's hiding with the paper.

4423
03:04:25,680 --> 03:04:27,960
Not like he grabbed it and wiped his ass with.

4424
03:04:31,720 --> 03:04:32,500
Okay, okay.

4425
03:04:33,680 --> 03:04:35,080
I think I have to do this, right?

4426
03:04:35,640 --> 03:04:36,240
Okay, no.

4427
03:04:36,440 --> 03:04:39,060
That skin looks like a bath.

4428
03:04:39,780 --> 03:04:40,180
Boom.

4429
03:04:41,480 --> 03:04:43,080
Thank you so much for the follow shadows!

4430
03:04:43,580 --> 03:04:45,020
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

4431
03:04:45,100 --> 03:04:47,420
Have a... have a fun heart.

4432
03:04:47,500 --> 03:04:48,440
Thank you so much.

4433
03:04:48,960 --> 03:04:49,620
Do I push?

4434
03:04:49,840 --> 03:04:50,040
Door.

4435
03:04:50,460 --> 03:04:50,860
Door!

4436
03:04:51,220 --> 03:04:52,340
No, not door.

4437
03:04:53,300 --> 03:04:54,120
Hello, fuck.

4438
03:04:57,110 --> 03:04:58,050
Can I climb up?

4439
03:04:58,470 --> 03:04:59,470
Can I climb you up?

4440
03:05:01,050 --> 03:05:01,450
No.

4441
03:05:01,450 --> 03:05:01,850
No.

4442
03:05:02,230 --> 03:05:03,110
Oh shit!

4443
03:05:03,270 --> 03:05:04,210
No, wait, no, wait.

4444
03:05:04,310 --> 03:05:05,150
I don't know what to do.

4445
03:05:07,330 --> 03:05:08,010
Stuck inside.

4446
03:05:14,370 --> 03:05:15,950
I don't know.

4447
03:05:16,330 --> 03:05:17,030
Just leaving?

4448
03:05:17,190 --> 03:05:17,670
I can't!

4449
03:05:17,690 --> 03:05:17,870
Look!

4450
03:05:23,500 --> 03:05:23,900
Wait.

4451
03:05:23,900 --> 03:05:25,360
Oh wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

4452
03:05:26,020 --> 03:05:26,740
Toilet paper.

4453
03:05:29,640 --> 03:05:30,040
Up.

4454
03:05:31,780 --> 03:05:32,760
Oh my god.

4455
03:05:33,980 --> 03:05:35,700
This is where I live now.

4456
03:05:36,000 --> 03:05:36,980
I guess...

4457
03:05:37,800 --> 03:05:39,380
I guess I live here now.

4458
03:05:39,720 --> 03:05:40,840
Break the mirror?

4459
03:05:40,940 --> 03:05:42,360
How the fuck do I break the mirror?

4460
03:05:42,460 --> 03:05:42,760
Boom.

4461
03:05:44,500 --> 03:05:45,300
Oh, please.

4462
03:05:45,560 --> 03:05:46,380
Let me out.

4463
03:05:46,820 --> 03:05:47,800
Let me out.

4464
03:05:48,220 --> 03:05:48,820
Oh no.

4465
03:05:50,580 --> 03:05:51,100
Can?

4466
03:05:52,020 --> 03:05:52,540
Oh!

4467
03:05:52,960 --> 03:05:55,200
He gave me a can from earlier!

4468
03:05:57,920 --> 03:05:59,220
He gave me a can!

4469
03:05:59,620 --> 03:06:00,060
Oh, fush.

4470
03:06:00,220 --> 03:06:00,740
Okay.

4471
03:06:01,780 --> 03:06:03,480
Okay, maybe... maybe... wait, wait, wait.

4472
03:06:05,240 --> 03:06:05,600
Okay.

4473
03:06:05,760 --> 03:06:07,200
Maybe it's not the can.

4474
03:06:08,020 --> 03:06:09,280
Maybe... wait, okay, okay, okay.

4475
03:06:10,500 --> 03:06:10,860
Ah!

4476
03:06:10,860 --> 03:06:11,760
Okay, maybe not.

4477
03:06:12,100 --> 03:06:12,460
Okay.

4478
03:06:14,740 --> 03:06:15,100
Oh!

4479
03:06:15,100 --> 03:06:15,460
Shit!

4480
03:06:15,580 --> 03:06:16,240
I broke the can!

4481
03:06:16,320 --> 03:06:17,040
I broke the mirror!

4482
03:06:17,140 --> 03:06:17,600
I'm sorry!

4483
03:06:19,720 --> 03:06:20,580
Okay, open the door.

4484
03:06:22,000 --> 03:06:22,780
Open the door.

4485
03:06:23,420 --> 03:06:23,780
Oh.

4486
03:06:25,420 --> 03:06:27,620
Oh, do I just go on the other side?

4487
03:06:27,800 --> 03:06:28,080
Okay.

4488
03:06:28,560 --> 03:06:28,920
Okay.

4489
03:06:33,080 --> 03:06:34,540
I thought he was gonna come back.

4490
03:06:38,680 --> 03:06:40,140
Had some laughs, so catch you later.

4491
03:06:40,560 --> 03:06:42,140
I'll go get that one on the record.

4492
03:06:42,560 --> 03:06:43,400
Alright, that's the scene.

4493
03:06:43,500 --> 03:06:44,900
Thank you so much for hanging out with us tonight.

4494
03:06:45,140 --> 03:06:46,400
I hope you have a good night's rest.

4495
03:06:46,920 --> 03:06:47,980
I hope you have a good night's rest.

4496
03:06:48,040 --> 03:06:49,140
Thank you for hanging out with us.

4497
03:06:49,360 --> 03:06:51,120
I didn't think that would work either.

4498
03:06:51,300 --> 03:06:52,480
I thought we were supposed to...

4499
03:06:52,480 --> 03:06:54,320
I thought we were supposed to break the mirror.

4500
03:06:54,560 --> 03:06:57,380
And then like the guy would like make noise and stuff.

4501
03:06:57,900 --> 03:06:58,620
And then...

4502
03:06:58,620 --> 03:07:00,840
And then... And then... The guy would like...

4503
03:07:00,860 --> 03:07:02,000
open the door and get out.

4504
03:07:02,100 --> 03:07:03,640
I didn't know that was another room.

4505
03:07:03,860 --> 03:07:05,060
I thought that was just...

4506
03:07:05,060 --> 03:07:07,880
I actually didn't think that was another room.

4507
03:07:16,240 --> 03:07:17,240
Oh shit, sorry.

4508
03:07:17,340 --> 03:07:18,860
My thingy is being weird.

4509
03:07:19,220 --> 03:07:20,960
Let me recalibrate.

4510
03:07:21,020 --> 03:07:21,500
Okay, there we go.

4511
03:07:25,280 --> 03:07:26,780
Have a good rest of the stream.

4512
03:07:26,880 --> 03:07:27,360
Alright, all dear.

4513
03:07:27,480 --> 03:07:28,660
Thanks for hanging out with us.

4514
03:07:28,940 --> 03:07:30,360
I really do appreciate it.

4515
03:07:30,400 --> 03:07:31,600
Hope you have a good rest of the day.

4516
03:07:33,260 --> 03:07:34,320
Alright, let me...

4517
03:07:34,320 --> 03:07:34,660
Let's...

4518
03:07:36,600 --> 03:07:37,800
Where the fuck is he?

4519
03:07:38,320 --> 03:07:39,440
Oh, he's chopping.

4520
03:07:39,600 --> 03:07:40,620
He's eating the chop chop.

4521
03:07:43,880 --> 03:07:45,000
Chop chop chop.

4522
03:07:45,820 --> 03:07:47,020
Chop chop chop.

4523
03:07:48,340 --> 03:07:49,940
Chop chop chop.

4524
03:07:49,980 --> 03:07:50,940
Chop chop chop.

4525
03:07:58,100 --> 03:07:59,840
Yeah, that's not gonna fuck me over.

4526
03:08:00,020 --> 03:08:00,420
Right?

4527
03:08:03,200 --> 03:08:04,640
Did I go down?

4528
03:08:05,960 --> 03:08:06,500
Ha!

4529
03:08:10,290 --> 03:08:11,870
I don't deserve here.

4530
03:08:11,870 --> 03:08:13,230
Why are you running away from...

4531
03:08:13,230 --> 03:08:13,830
Dude, you're scaring...

4532
03:08:13,830 --> 03:08:14,910
Look how ugly they are!

4533
03:08:18,010 --> 03:08:18,590
That's why.

4534
03:08:22,070 --> 03:08:23,030
They're freaks.

4535
03:08:27,260 --> 03:08:29,000
Doki's intelligence scares me.

4536
03:08:29,100 --> 03:08:30,380
I know I'm so smart.

4537
03:08:30,660 --> 03:08:31,380
I know.

4538
03:08:31,800 --> 03:08:34,340
It scares me too, how smart I am sometimes.

4539
03:08:42,250 --> 03:08:42,730
What?

4540
03:08:43,070 --> 03:08:43,270
What?

4541
03:08:43,330 --> 03:08:44,950
Leave me alone.

4542
03:08:45,090 --> 03:08:45,650
Leave me alone.

4543
03:08:45,650 --> 03:08:46,550
Leave me alone.

4544
03:08:46,810 --> 03:08:48,030
Leave me alone.

4545
03:08:48,590 --> 03:08:49,030
No!

4546
03:08:49,370 --> 03:08:49,910
No!

4547
03:08:57,000 --> 03:08:58,220
Just keep running.

4548
03:08:58,420 --> 03:08:59,100
Just keep running.

4549
03:08:59,400 --> 03:09:00,520
Just keep running straight.

4550
03:09:00,900 --> 03:09:02,340
Just keep running straight.

4551
03:09:02,820 --> 03:09:03,460
Oh no!

4552
03:09:03,620 --> 03:09:04,440
Now it's down.

4553
03:09:04,640 --> 03:09:05,360
Now it's down!

4554
03:09:05,960 --> 03:09:06,640
What?

4555
03:09:08,780 --> 03:09:11,180
Thank you so much for the follow.

4556
03:09:11,180 --> 03:09:12,620
Thank you.

4557
03:09:12,760 --> 03:09:13,320
Thank you.

4558
03:09:13,740 --> 03:09:14,920
I'm tired.

4559
03:09:17,920 --> 03:09:20,140
Okay, clearly we don't keep going straight.

4560
03:09:20,480 --> 03:09:23,100
We don't keep running straight.

4561
03:09:25,200 --> 03:09:28,380
I have learned that it's just not only straight.

4562
03:09:28,900 --> 03:09:30,240
It's not just straight.

4563
03:09:30,300 --> 03:09:31,260
It's down too.

4564
03:09:33,840 --> 03:09:35,120
It's also down.

4565
03:09:35,380 --> 03:09:36,320
Alright, I'm not...

4566
03:09:36,320 --> 03:09:37,720
Alright, I got this.

4567
03:09:37,840 --> 03:09:39,560
Oh, please don't touch me.

4568
03:09:40,240 --> 03:09:41,360
Don't touch me.

4569
03:09:41,740 --> 03:09:42,840
Don't touch me.

4570
03:09:45,760 --> 03:09:47,040
Okay, okay.

4571
03:09:47,100 --> 03:09:47,460
Down.

4572
03:09:47,640 --> 03:09:48,040
Down.

4573
03:09:48,140 --> 03:09:48,540
Down.

4574
03:09:48,660 --> 03:09:49,000
Down.

4575
03:09:49,000 --> 03:09:49,080
Down.

4576
03:09:49,080 --> 03:09:49,180
Down.

4577
03:09:50,480 --> 03:09:51,440
The bee hop.

4578
03:09:51,580 --> 03:09:52,200
The bee hop.

4579
03:09:52,700 --> 03:09:53,520
Oh my god.

4580
03:09:53,700 --> 03:09:54,260
Get out.

4581
03:09:55,660 --> 03:09:56,060
Yeah.

4582
03:09:56,200 --> 03:09:57,580
What you gonna fucking...

4583
03:10:00,520 --> 03:10:00,920
Ah!

4584
03:10:00,980 --> 03:10:01,380
Ah!

4585
03:10:01,480 --> 03:10:01,880
No!

4586
03:10:02,080 --> 03:10:02,680
Bee hop.

4587
03:10:02,740 --> 03:10:03,100
Bee hop.

4588
03:10:03,180 --> 03:10:03,580
Bee hop.

4589
03:10:03,660 --> 03:10:03,900
No!

4590
03:10:04,040 --> 03:10:04,540
Bee hop!

4591
03:10:04,700 --> 03:10:04,900
No!

4592
03:10:06,240 --> 03:10:06,640
Please!

4593
03:10:06,840 --> 03:10:07,680
Oh my god!

4594
03:10:08,920 --> 03:10:09,320
Ah!

4595
03:10:09,900 --> 03:10:10,300
No!

4596
03:10:12,340 --> 03:10:13,640
Oh my god.

4597
03:10:13,660 --> 03:10:14,160
The bee hop.

4598
03:10:14,320 --> 03:10:15,100
The bee hop.

4599
03:10:15,840 --> 03:10:16,400
The bee hop.

4600
03:10:16,400 --> 03:10:17,200
He's like, idiot.

4601
03:10:17,740 --> 03:10:19,460
The bee hop is amazing.

4602
03:10:22,520 --> 03:10:23,220
That's right.

4603
03:10:25,160 --> 03:10:25,720
Alright.

4604
03:10:25,860 --> 03:10:28,300
Let me look at him.

4605
03:10:29,280 --> 03:10:30,640
Oh, they're just eating now.

4606
03:10:31,180 --> 03:10:31,560
The fuck?

4607
03:10:33,980 --> 03:10:38,400
It's hard to end stream think about what just happened.

4608
03:10:39,240 --> 03:10:39,800
It's hard to end stream think about what just happened.

4609
03:10:40,300 --> 03:10:41,520
They're just chillin'.

4610
03:10:42,080 --> 03:10:44,080

03:10:47,960 --> 03:10:53,960

Break the doll.

4621
03:11:13,940 --> 03:11:14,400
Where's the doll?

4622
03:11:14,940 --> 03:11:16,300
Shit, did I forgot about the doll?

4623
03:11:17,620 --> 03:11:18,940
I forgot about the doll.

4624
03:11:19,480 --> 03:11:20,960
I thought there was a doll here.

4625
03:11:21,940 --> 03:11:22,940
Is it back there?

4626
03:11:23,800 --> 03:11:24,600
Oh no!

4627
03:11:24,780 --> 03:11:25,260
I forgot!

4628
03:11:26,910 --> 03:11:28,150
Let me back in!

4629
03:11:29,010 --> 03:11:30,470
It won't let me back in!

4630
03:11:30,770 --> 03:11:31,570
It's closed!

4631
03:11:33,430 --> 03:11:35,390
We don't need this stupid doll.

4632
03:11:35,850 --> 03:11:37,290
Oh shit, I need it.

4633
03:11:37,530 --> 03:11:38,390
Are you hungry?

4634
03:11:38,770 --> 03:11:40,070
How could you be hungry?

4635
03:11:40,070 --> 03:11:41,990
There was food everywhere!

4636
03:11:43,660 --> 03:11:44,690
Stupid girl!

4637
03:11:45,870 --> 03:11:47,390
How are you hungry?

4638
03:11:49,570 --> 03:11:51,630
There was so much food!

4654
03:12:33,020 --> 03:12:33,900

4655
03:12:34,320 --> 03:12:35,140

4656
03:12:36,840 --> 03:12:37,660

It was not what I...

4662
03:12:48,860 --> 03:12:50,300

03:12:51,720 --> 03:12:52,160
Um...

4664
03:12:52,600 --> 03:12:54,000
It's not what I expected.

4665
03:12:54,460 --> 03:12:55,720
But I didn't...

4666
03:12:56,720 --> 03:12:58,980
But I got fed.

Can I get more 4900 real quick for Sire and that's why the gifted sub.

4677
03:13:17,760 --> 03:13:20,540
That team I had to kill all you noticed that, didn't you?

4678
03:13:20,840 --> 03:13:21,360
Hahaha...

4679
03:13:22,880 --> 03:13:24,040
I had to...

4680
03:13:24,040 --> 03:13:26,040
You're running away from the monsters...

4681
03:13:26,040 --> 03:13:27,840
But you were the monster all along!

4682
03:13:30,720 --> 03:13:33,200
Oh my god, there's something wrong with this child.

4683
03:13:33,400 --> 03:13:33,780
What was that?

4684
03:13:35,720 --> 03:13:38,000
Something wrong with this child...

4685
03:13:38,000 --> 03:13:38,520
Hahaha!

4686
03:13:38,520 --> 03:13:41,980
I did not think that's what she was gonna...

4687
03:13:41,980 --> 03:13:43,100
Wait, there's the lady.

4688
03:13:44,240 --> 03:13:44,860
Lady!

4689
03:13:45,680 --> 03:13:46,840
Lady, it's me!

4690
03:13:47,730 --> 03:13:48,040
Oh.

4691
03:13:49,460 --> 03:13:50,680
Okay, bye lady.

4692
03:13:53,100 --> 03:13:53,720
Wait.

4693
03:13:54,300 --> 03:13:55,540
Oh, pretty lady.

4694
03:13:59,140 --> 03:13:59,760
Ugh.

4695
03:14:01,040 --> 03:14:02,080
It's my turn.

4696
03:14:03,690 --> 03:14:04,520
It's my turn.

4697
03:14:05,040 --> 03:14:05,660
Lady!

4698
03:14:05,660 --> 03:14:05,820
Lady!

4699
03:14:07,060 --> 03:14:07,760
It's me!

4700
03:14:11,920 --> 03:14:12,440
Alright.

4701
03:14:12,440 --> 03:14:12,960
Alright.

4702
03:14:16,280 --> 03:14:18,240
Another achievement we just got.

4703
03:14:18,300 --> 03:14:20,400
I'm gonna drink some tea while we wait here.

4704
03:14:22,620 --> 03:14:26,420
Wait, is this a cutscene?

4705
03:14:27,340 --> 03:14:28,340
It's a cutscene.

4706
03:14:31,060 --> 03:14:31,940
Oh, it's not.

4707
03:14:35,720 --> 03:14:36,900
It's not a cutscene.

4708
03:14:36,980 --> 03:14:37,820
I just moved.

4709
03:14:46,310 --> 03:14:47,990
It was not a cutscene.

4710
03:14:48,090 --> 03:14:48,810
By the way.

4711
03:14:52,850 --> 03:14:56,230
I don't know if you've seen this game before but I'm hardly laughing right now.

4712
03:14:57,970 --> 03:14:58,410
Like...

4713
03:15:00,690 --> 03:15:03,070
I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing.

4714
03:15:03,530 --> 03:15:04,110
I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing.

4715
03:15:04,110 --> 03:15:04,230
Um...

4716
03:15:06,950 --> 03:15:08,650
Okay, we go this way.

4717
03:15:08,710 --> 03:15:10,610
I thought it was a cutscene because it was zoomed in.

4718
03:15:10,850 --> 03:15:11,870
I was like just waiting.

4719
03:15:23,200 --> 03:15:24,120
Rolling up.

4720
03:15:33,320 --> 03:15:34,360
Oh, she's singing.

4721
03:15:39,510 --> 03:15:40,670
Hey, it's me.

4722
03:15:40,670 --> 03:15:40,750
Hey.

4723
03:15:44,110 --> 03:15:46,350
I think I died.

4724
03:15:59,550 --> 03:16:02,330
Okay, I didn't expect that.

4725
03:16:02,530 --> 03:16:06,590
I really didn't expect that.

4726
03:16:06,590 --> 03:16:06,990
I know.

4727
03:16:09,650 --> 03:16:10,610
I don't know.

4728
03:16:10,690 --> 03:16:11,870
I was like, hey there, lady.

4729
03:16:12,650 --> 03:16:13,330
Hey there.

4730
03:16:22,580 --> 03:16:25,100
And when she sees you, she goes on my sentence, Robert.

4731
03:16:29,250 --> 03:16:30,250
I don't know what to do.

4732
03:16:31,590 --> 03:16:32,470
Oh, closet?

4733
03:16:33,610 --> 03:16:34,050
Open?

4734
03:16:35,190 --> 03:16:36,390
Oh, no, not open.

4735
03:16:37,450 --> 03:16:38,850
What do you want me to do, lady?

4736
03:16:40,750 --> 03:16:41,190
Up?

4737
03:16:43,810 --> 03:16:44,250
Up.

4738
03:16:47,700 --> 03:16:48,800
Oh, shit, I'm so smart.

4739
03:16:51,720 --> 03:16:53,700
Oh, wait, I need...

4740
03:16:56,360 --> 03:16:56,840
What?

4741
03:16:57,380 --> 03:16:57,860
Up?

4742
03:16:58,560 --> 03:16:59,040
Up?

4743
03:16:59,460 --> 03:16:59,860
Oh!

4744
03:17:04,900 --> 03:17:07,120
What the fuck do I do, lady?

4745
03:17:08,240 --> 03:17:10,260
Lady, what do you want me to do, lady?

4746
03:17:13,480 --> 03:17:13,960
Whoa!

4747
03:17:14,140 --> 03:17:14,580
What the...

4748
03:17:16,080 --> 03:17:17,540
Okay, she didn't like that.

4749
03:17:17,960 --> 03:17:18,440
She...

4750
03:17:18,440 --> 03:17:20,200
She didn't like that when I...

4751
03:17:20,200 --> 03:17:22,580
She didn't like that I kept jumping up and down.

4752
03:17:27,980 --> 03:17:30,540
Fall down on the closet knobs?

4753
03:17:30,940 --> 03:17:31,780
Oh, shit.

4754
03:17:32,200 --> 03:17:33,080
You're right.

4755
03:17:33,260 --> 03:17:33,960
Let's try that.

4756
03:17:34,420 --> 03:17:35,500
Dumb, dumb.

4757
03:17:53,980 --> 03:17:54,920
Hello, original.

4758
03:17:55,860 --> 03:17:56,460
Well...

4759
03:17:56,460 --> 03:17:56,640
Ah!

4760
03:17:56,700 --> 03:17:57,460
Oh, shit.

4761
03:17:58,320 --> 03:18:01,420
Okay, I didn't jump.

4762
03:18:01,500 --> 03:18:02,560
I didn't jump just then.

4763
03:18:04,060 --> 03:18:04,380
No...

4764
03:18:15,680 --> 03:18:16,880
No, that wasn't it.

4765
03:18:17,080 --> 03:18:17,980
That wasn't it.

4766
03:18:18,120 --> 03:18:20,000
Also, thank you so much for the follow craze.

4767
03:18:20,220 --> 03:18:20,720
Thank you.

4768
03:18:20,720 --> 03:18:21,000
Thank you.

4769
03:18:21,020 --> 03:18:21,260
Thank you.

4770
03:18:21,280 --> 03:18:21,560
Thank you.

4771
03:18:21,800 --> 03:18:22,440
Have a...

4772
03:18:23,060 --> 03:18:23,940
Have a butt heart.

4773
03:18:24,020 --> 03:18:24,920
Thank you so much.

4774
03:18:25,560 --> 03:18:26,220
What do I do?

4775
03:18:27,540 --> 03:18:27,860
Jumping.

4776
03:18:28,320 --> 03:18:29,660
What do you want me to do, lady?

4777
03:18:31,480 --> 03:18:31,800
Here?

4778
03:18:34,720 --> 03:18:35,040
What?

4779
03:18:36,240 --> 03:18:37,660
What do you want me to do, lady?

4780
03:18:38,100 --> 03:18:39,100
What do you want...

4781
03:18:41,480 --> 03:18:43,100
I can't even look at you?

4782
03:18:48,140 --> 03:18:49,020
Stupid lady...

4783
03:18:51,660 --> 03:18:53,420
Okay, I know what to do.

4784
03:18:53,560 --> 03:18:53,880
I know.

4785
03:18:54,340 --> 03:18:56,360
I like how it's like I'm sneaking into your...

4786
03:18:56,360 --> 03:18:59,800
Oh wait... oh wait...

4787
03:19:11,020 --> 03:19:11,900
Stupid lady...

4788
03:19:14,260 --> 03:19:16,940
I know we're just like damn...

4789
03:19:16,940 --> 03:19:20,740
We should like try and climb to it and then I have cramps.

4790
03:19:29,520 --> 03:19:33,360
Look, I have a perfectly good explanation for this.

4791
03:19:35,220 --> 03:19:37,440
I just... look she's pretty okay?

4792
03:19:37,640 --> 03:19:39,540
She's a really pretty lady.

4793
03:19:39,820 --> 03:19:42,120
And we haven't seen any ladies in a while.

4794
03:19:44,420 --> 03:19:47,200
It's been a while since we saw all these pretty ladies.

4795
03:19:49,120 --> 03:19:49,640
Okay.

4796
03:19:51,440 --> 03:19:53,340
Breaking the maze you fucking sim.

4797
03:19:57,780 --> 03:19:58,540
I'm sneaking.

4798
03:19:58,780 --> 03:19:59,360
I'm sneaking.

4799
03:19:59,480 --> 03:19:59,800
I'm sneaking.

4800
03:20:02,380 --> 03:20:03,860
I'm not good at stealth.

4801
03:20:04,120 --> 03:20:05,420
I'm bad at stealth.

4802
03:20:05,500 --> 03:20:06,560
I'm sorry guys.

4803
03:20:08,300 --> 03:20:09,760
And then she coming over.

4804
03:20:12,060 --> 03:20:12,660
Hello?

4805
03:20:15,120 --> 03:20:15,720
Lady?

4806
03:20:15,720 --> 03:20:16,320
Lady?

4807
03:20:20,720 --> 03:20:22,640
To be fair we forgot it too.

4808
03:20:22,700 --> 03:20:23,940
Yeah, it wasn't just...

4809
03:20:23,940 --> 03:20:25,000
We all forgot.

4810
03:20:26,000 --> 03:20:27,860
We forgot it together.

4811
03:20:30,720 --> 03:20:31,800
Got the key.

4812
03:20:36,620 --> 03:20:37,220
Okay.

4813
03:20:39,260 --> 03:20:39,860
Okay.

4814
03:20:39,860 --> 03:20:43,160
I don't even know what the game's about but I'm loving it so far.

4815
03:20:43,160 --> 03:20:43,960
I don't even know either.

4816
03:20:44,060 --> 03:20:46,080
I've been playing this game for like three hours already.

4817
03:20:46,380 --> 03:20:48,100
And I don't even... Oh wait sorry not three hours.

4818
03:20:48,200 --> 03:20:48,940
30 minutes already.

4819
03:20:49,280 --> 03:20:52,820
And I almost... I accidentally added an extra zero by mistake guys.

4820
03:20:53,980 --> 03:20:55,080
Do I need to keep sneaking?

4821
03:20:55,560 --> 03:20:56,320
I don't right?

4822
03:21:03,220 --> 03:21:04,280
Wait I'm gonna break you.

4823
03:21:04,720 --> 03:21:05,820
I'm gonna break you first.

4824
03:21:08,340 --> 03:21:09,460
Yeah 30 minutes.

4825
03:21:09,620 --> 03:21:10,860
I've been playing this game for 30 minutes.

4826
03:21:10,920 --> 03:21:12,740
I still don't know what the fuck we're doing guys.

4827
03:21:17,440 --> 03:21:20,600
Thank you so much for the follow on Serial...

4828
03:21:20,600 --> 03:21:21,300
Thank you thank you.

4829
03:21:21,320 --> 03:21:22,340
I do appreciate it.

4830
03:21:22,360 --> 03:21:23,480
Thank you so much.

4831
03:21:24,240 --> 03:21:28,240
No butthurt yet cause I have to hold onto this key while I'm running.

4832
03:21:28,460 --> 03:21:31,500
So I can't give you a butthurt yet.

4833
03:21:31,960 --> 03:21:34,960
But I will as soon as I get to the bottom of this house.

4834
03:21:37,200 --> 03:21:37,940
Okay okay.

4835
03:21:38,100 --> 03:21:38,380
Boom.

4836
03:21:38,580 --> 03:21:40,160
Alright here's a butthurt for you.

4837
03:21:40,340 --> 03:21:41,260
Thank you thank you thank you.

4838
03:21:42,720 --> 03:21:43,160
Alright.

4839
03:21:43,480 --> 03:21:45,200
I think we're on the almost to the end too.

4840
03:21:53,120 --> 03:21:53,700
Lady!

4841
03:21:54,460 --> 03:21:55,040
Lady!

4842
03:21:55,080 --> 03:21:55,860
I'm sorry lady!

4843
03:21:56,180 --> 03:21:56,760
Lady!

4844
03:21:56,900 --> 03:21:57,360
Please!

4845
03:21:58,420 --> 03:21:59,000
Lady!

4846
03:22:07,020 --> 03:22:08,380
I'm sorry lady.

4847
03:22:08,560 --> 03:22:09,260
I'm sorry.

4848
03:22:13,140 --> 03:22:16,220
Alright so I've seen I'm not gonna help you.

4849
03:22:25,540 --> 03:22:27,660
She'll have one waiting for you this time.

4850
03:22:29,360 --> 03:22:30,180
What the fuck?

4851
03:22:36,170 --> 03:22:36,970
Oh, okay.

4852
03:22:42,520 --> 03:22:44,520
I remember my first butthurt.

4853
03:22:44,580 --> 03:22:46,280
I was like, Nani, what did she say?

4854
03:22:48,700 --> 03:22:49,840
Oh, there's a mirror here.

4855
03:22:50,080 --> 03:22:50,820
Oh hey, look at this.

4856
03:22:50,900 --> 03:22:51,360
This is the mirror.

4857
03:22:51,480 --> 03:22:52,080
Do I break it?

4858
03:22:54,260 --> 03:22:54,900
Oh!

4859
03:22:56,620 --> 03:22:58,080
I'm gonna carry you.

4860
03:22:59,680 --> 03:23:01,560
I'm gonna carry you around.

4861
03:23:15,620 --> 03:23:16,900
Hey lady.

4862
03:23:17,660 --> 03:23:18,300
Lady!

4863
03:23:18,980 --> 03:23:20,560
Look, I got a mirror, lady!

4864
03:23:22,620 --> 03:23:23,260
Lady?

4865
03:23:24,160 --> 03:23:24,600
Lady!

4866
03:23:24,640 --> 03:23:24,960

4867
03:23:25,060 --> 03:23:25,480

4870
03:23:28,360 --> 03:23:28,800
Okay,

4871
03:23:32,700 --> 03:23:33,060
okay.

4872
03:23:35,180 --> 03:23:36,060
Where's the light?

4873
03:23:36,300 --> 03:23:37,280
Where's the light?

4874
03:23:37,560 --> 03:23:38,000
Light!

4875
03:23:40,600 --> 03:23:43,720
Oh, I don't even... I'm so smart, I didn't even know.

4876
03:23:43,780 --> 03:23:44,460
I didn't even know!

4877
03:23:44,540 --> 03:23:45,260
I didn't even know!

4878
03:23:45,320 --> 03:23:46,860
I just wanted to carry a mirror around!

4879
03:23:47,140 --> 03:23:47,920
I just wanted...

4880
03:23:49,940 --> 03:23:53,820
I just wanted to carry a mirror around.

4881
03:23:55,160 --> 03:23:56,260
So fucking smart.

4882
03:23:59,960 --> 03:24:01,600
Where are you, lady?

4883
03:24:01,940 --> 03:24:02,360
Lady!

4884
03:24:02,500 --> 03:24:02,980
Lady!

4885
03:24:04,760 --> 03:24:05,420
Lady!

4886
03:24:05,800 --> 03:24:05,820
Lady!

4887
03:24:05,820 --> 03:24:06,440
Please, lady!

4888
03:24:06,600 --> 03:24:07,380
Look at yourself!

4889
03:24:07,760 --> 03:24:08,260
Lady!

4890
03:24:08,360 --> 03:24:08,680
Lady!

4891
03:24:15,940 --> 03:24:17,260
Oh shit.

4892
03:24:17,380 --> 03:24:18,920
Where's the light?

4893
03:24:19,060 --> 03:24:19,900
Where is it?

4894
03:24:22,480 --> 03:24:23,540
Where's the light?

4895
03:24:25,100 --> 03:24:25,120
Where is it?

4896
03:24:31,980 --> 03:24:35,940
Lady, lady, lady, lady, lady, lady, lady, lady, lady!

4897
03:24:38,180 --> 03:24:38,960
How many?

4898
03:24:39,120 --> 03:24:41,220
How much do you need to look at yourself?

4899
03:24:41,680 --> 03:24:44,680
How much more?

4900
03:24:44,820 --> 03:24:45,600
How much more?

4901
03:24:45,660 --> 03:24:46,300
How much more?

4902
03:24:50,200 --> 03:24:51,320
Please get up.

4903
03:24:52,000 --> 03:24:52,680
I'm winning.

4904
03:24:52,860 --> 03:24:53,820
Am I winning, son?

4905
03:24:53,820 --> 03:24:54,840
Am I winning?

4906
03:24:56,460 --> 03:24:58,100
Your health bar is high.

4907
03:24:58,260 --> 03:25:00,980
Oh, shi- Bye, lady.

4908
03:25:12,300 --> 03:25:13,900
You win.

4909
03:25:20,100 --> 03:25:20,900
Lady?

4910
03:25:23,560 --> 03:25:24,360
Lady?

4911
03:25:29,930 --> 03:25:30,730
Lady?

4912
03:25:37,260 --> 03:25:38,440
This is...

4913
03:25:40,720 --> 03:25:41,160
Why?

4914
03:25:42,460 --> 03:25:43,580
Why, lady?

4915
03:25:44,960 --> 03:25:45,640
Why?

4916
03:25:45,640 --> 03:25:46,780
Am I gonna eat her?

4917
03:25:50,440 --> 03:25:51,120
Lady?

4918
03:25:54,400 --> 03:25:55,080
Lady?

4919
03:25:57,180 --> 03:25:57,860
Lady?

4920
03:25:57,940 --> 03:25:58,040
Oh!

4921
03:25:58,060 --> 03:25:58,340
Oh!

4922
03:25:58,340 --> 03:25:58,660
Oh!

4923
03:25:58,660 --> 03:25:59,000
Oh!

4924
03:26:02,300 --> 03:26:04,020
What the fuck?

4925
03:26:04,420 --> 03:26:05,100
What the fuck?

4926
03:26:08,160 --> 03:26:09,720
Oh my god.

4927
03:26:10,580 --> 03:26:11,380
Oh!

4928
03:26:11,500 --> 03:26:13,000
What the fuck?

4929
03:26:13,900 --> 03:26:15,760
I was just joking.

4930
03:26:15,980 --> 03:26:16,720
I ate her.

4931
03:26:16,880 --> 03:26:17,960
Oh my god.

4932
03:26:18,040 --> 03:26:19,900
What did I eat the true monster?

4933
03:26:20,500 --> 03:26:22,200
Oh my god.

4934
03:26:28,440 --> 03:26:30,620
I was joking.

4935
03:26:31,440 --> 03:26:32,240
Holy...

4936
03:26:32,240 --> 03:26:34,460
I hate people joking.

4937
03:26:35,720 --> 03:26:36,940
Oh shit.

4938
03:26:37,480 --> 03:26:39,780
You did the worst of us.

4939
03:26:42,920 --> 03:26:44,000
Oh my god.

4940
03:26:47,200 --> 03:26:48,780
Am I lady now?

4941
03:26:49,200 --> 03:26:50,400
Am I the lady?

4942
03:26:55,470 --> 03:26:56,710
I'm lady now.

4943
03:27:01,720 --> 03:27:02,120
Okay.

4944
03:27:02,320 --> 03:27:02,720
Okay.

4945
03:27:02,740 --> 03:27:04,460
I was gonna be like, is this gonna be a cutscene again?

4946
03:27:04,660 --> 03:27:05,400
But then I moved.

4947
03:27:05,560 --> 03:27:07,900
I knew I... I knew I was gonna have to move this time.

4948
03:27:11,320 --> 03:27:13,620
I am the apex predator.

4949
03:27:14,720 --> 03:27:15,980
Doki's the lady.

4950
03:27:16,100 --> 03:27:17,420
I'm the lady now.

4951
03:27:18,280 --> 03:27:19,440
It is I.

4952
03:27:21,240 --> 03:27:22,340
Oh shit.

4953
03:27:22,400 --> 03:27:23,960
I'm in the... Holy shit!

4954
03:27:24,520 --> 03:27:25,780
What the fuck?

4955
03:27:26,040 --> 03:27:27,400
Oh my god.

4956
03:27:27,480 --> 03:27:27,880
What?

4957
03:27:30,180 --> 03:27:31,700
Lady Doki.

4958
03:27:31,940 --> 03:27:32,680
Yeah.

4959
03:27:32,740 --> 03:27:33,320
Yeah.

4960
03:27:35,200 --> 03:27:36,840
Oh my god.

4961
03:27:36,840 --> 03:27:37,040
I'm gonna die.

4962
03:27:45,080 --> 03:27:45,680
Yeah.

4963
03:27:45,780 --> 03:27:46,180
That's right.

4964
03:27:46,640 --> 03:27:47,500
That's right.

4965
03:27:47,540 --> 03:27:49,480
I'm gonna fucking walk up to all of them.

4966
03:27:50,380 --> 03:27:51,180
Oh no.

4967
03:27:51,240 --> 03:27:53,240
She really is the apex predator.

4968
03:27:55,260 --> 03:27:57,640
What the fuck is going on?

4969
03:27:58,440 --> 03:27:59,040
Yeah.

4970
03:28:00,060 --> 03:28:00,920
Oh yeah.

4971
03:28:02,460 --> 03:28:04,620
Small people rise up.

4972
03:28:05,820 --> 03:28:07,560
I have no... I don't know.

4973
03:28:07,920 --> 03:28:09,620
I became the lady.

4974
03:28:09,620 --> 03:28:12,040
And now I'm consuming everyone.

4975
03:28:51,530 --> 03:28:52,870
Hardhacks for everyone.

4976
03:29:06,120 --> 03:29:07,480
Oh my god.

4977
03:29:07,500 --> 03:29:07,980
I'm tired.

4978
03:29:08,500 --> 03:29:11,260
Thank you so much for the... for the gift.

4979
03:29:11,380 --> 03:29:13,200
For the gift of some... some mooshikai.

4980
03:29:13,440 --> 03:29:13,980
Thank you.

4981
03:29:14,020 --> 03:29:14,400
Thank you.

4982
03:29:14,700 --> 03:29:15,220
Oh.

4983
03:29:15,540 --> 03:29:16,060
Wait.

4984
03:29:16,140 --> 03:29:18,440
Can we get some bark knights real quick for the two?

4985
03:29:18,440 --> 03:29:18,600
Thank you.

4986
03:29:18,600 --> 03:29:19,580
Thank you again!

4987
03:29:35,710 --> 03:29:36,590
Am I out?

4988
03:29:36,730 --> 03:29:37,050
I'm out.

4989
03:29:37,110 --> 03:29:38,170
I'm finally out.

4990
03:29:38,610 --> 03:29:40,250
I need some claps too.

4991
03:29:40,450 --> 03:29:41,250
Some claps.

4992
03:29:41,250 --> 03:29:41,450
Sorry.

4993
03:29:41,730 --> 03:29:42,490
Oh shit!

4994
03:29:42,770 --> 03:29:43,630
That was it!

4995
03:29:45,550 --> 03:29:46,210
We did it!

4996
03:29:48,250 --> 03:29:49,290
We did it!

4997
03:29:51,710 --> 03:29:53,390
We fucking did it!

4998
03:29:56,990 --> 03:29:58,110
35 minutes.

4999
03:29:58,210 --> 03:30:00,810
It only took us 35 minutes.

5000
03:30:00,930 --> 03:30:01,250
Oh shit.

5001
03:30:01,290 --> 03:30:01,670
Sorry.

5002
03:30:01,830 --> 03:30:02,750
I mean 30 minutes.

5003
03:30:02,890 --> 03:30:04,970
30 minutes, zero deaths.

5004
03:30:05,270 --> 03:30:06,710
Dude, that has to be a world record.

5005
03:30:06,990 --> 03:30:09,590
That has to be a speedrun record right there.

5006
03:30:09,830 --> 03:30:11,010
Look at Doki Bird.

5007
03:30:11,090 --> 03:30:12,450
30 minutes, zero deaths.

5008
03:30:12,710 --> 03:30:14,190
Beehop extraordinaire.

5009
03:30:14,970 --> 03:30:15,810
Holy fuck.

5010
03:30:17,430 --> 03:30:19,770
I still don't know what the fuck just happened.

5011
03:30:20,030 --> 03:30:20,750
I just went...

5012
03:30:20,750 --> 03:30:22,110
I became the lady.

5013
03:30:22,230 --> 03:30:26,270
I became the lady, chat.

5014
03:30:27,830 --> 03:30:29,490
Lady Doki Bird the lady.

5015
03:30:29,510 --> 03:30:29,810
I win.

5016
03:30:30,830 --> 03:30:32,050
Alright, so now you're done.

5017
03:30:32,230 --> 03:30:36,210
You're assuming that the main character, aka Six, is the lady's daughter?

5018
03:30:36,430 --> 03:30:37,270
Oh shit!

5019
03:30:37,310 --> 03:30:38,210
I am the lady.

5020
03:30:44,340 --> 03:30:46,080
Yates the souls of the meat men.

5021
03:30:46,500 --> 03:30:47,820
I'm the lady now.

5022
03:30:49,720 --> 03:30:50,980
I am the lady.

5023
03:30:51,640 --> 03:30:52,460
Holy shit.

5024
03:30:52,500 --> 03:30:54,240
That was a fun game, guys.

5025
03:30:54,340 --> 03:30:56,120
I really had a lot of fun.

5026
03:30:56,220 --> 03:30:57,280
It was in...

5027
03:30:58,060 --> 03:30:58,980
Always a good night.

5028
03:30:58,980 --> 03:31:00,720
Oh, that's so sweet.

5029
03:31:00,760 --> 03:31:01,320
Thank you.

5030
03:31:01,640 --> 03:31:03,200
What horror games do you plan to play?

5031
03:31:03,240 --> 03:31:04,860
I think we're gonna do Visage tomorrow.

5032
03:31:05,400 --> 03:31:07,640
Because I wanna do like a horror game.

5033
03:31:09,540 --> 03:31:12,520
We're gonna do four to five horror streams before the end of October.

5034
03:31:12,900 --> 03:31:15,840
And I think we're gonna do Visage tomorrow.

5035
03:31:16,300 --> 03:31:18,620
I don't know how long Visage is, so we'll see.

5036
03:31:18,720 --> 03:31:19,040
We'll see.

5037
03:31:19,080 --> 03:31:21,740
Because I wanna do like a different horror game each stream.

5038
03:31:22,100 --> 03:31:24,640
So that means we're gonna play four different horror games.

5039
03:31:25,820 --> 03:31:27,360
Eat the lady, become the lady.

5040
03:31:27,780 --> 03:31:29,200
Eat the lady, become the lady.

5041
03:31:29,200 --> 03:31:34,180
lol Are you guys familiar with how to move around the ship?

5042
03:31:34,380 --> 03:31:35,440
Yeah, that seems right.

5043
03:31:35,660 --> 03:31:36,600
That seems right.

5044
03:31:36,820 --> 03:31:39,620
I wanna know who the fuck were the gnomes, the gnomey gnomes.

5045
03:31:39,800 --> 03:31:41,360
Um, what are the games?

5046
03:31:41,360 --> 03:31:42,000
I don't know yet.

5047
03:31:42,080 --> 03:31:43,240
I'm not... I haven't decided yet.

5048
03:31:43,380 --> 03:31:48,220
But, um, yeah, I'm like, really honestly I decided games like two hours...

5049
03:31:48,220 --> 03:31:50,280
Like, I think I decided games the very last minute.

5050
03:31:50,500 --> 03:31:55,400
So, lol So I don't know what we're gonna do after Visage.

5051
03:31:56,000 --> 03:31:57,480
789 but 60 air...

5052
03:31:57,480 --> 03:31:59,000
Oh my god, yes.

5053
03:31:59,600 --> 03:32:07,540
Also that the lady wanted to be the most beautiful and made this place to make sure everyone ate too much and became fat.

5054
03:32:07,580 --> 03:32:08,600
Oh, so they were ugly!

5055
03:32:09,040 --> 03:32:11,280
So they were ugly, I knew it!

5056
03:32:13,560 --> 03:32:16,260
So I wasn't being mean when I called them ugly.

5057
03:32:20,480 --> 03:32:23,100
And she might have had an accident, hence the mask.

5058
03:32:23,380 --> 03:32:26,100
And while all mirrors were broken, she died due to her reflection.

5059
03:32:26,100 --> 03:32:28,700
Oh shit, so she was ugly too.

5060
03:32:29,000 --> 03:32:29,980
And she died.

5061
03:32:31,840 --> 03:32:35,800
I heard on Sesame Street Numbler Edition is a very scary game to play.

5062
03:32:36,020 --> 03:32:37,980
Which time zone are you in if you don't mind me asking?

5063
03:32:38,120 --> 03:32:40,600
I'm in NA, PST, Pacific Time.

5064
03:32:41,820 --> 03:32:47,020
Um, you weren't when you were just hungry, damn, Snickers were right all over.

5065
03:32:47,960 --> 03:32:51,120
Oh my gosh, um, died from ugly state.

5066
03:32:55,640 --> 03:32:57,980
Fuck, that's too real, man.

5067
03:32:58,060 --> 03:32:58,500
I didn't know that.

5068
03:32:58,520 --> 03:32:59,280
That's too real!

5069
03:33:01,460 --> 03:33:03,260
She's in no time zone, she dumps the streams.

5070
03:33:03,380 --> 03:33:04,780
Yeah, I stream in my own time zone.

5071
03:33:05,200 --> 03:33:07,040
It's my own time zone, guys.

5072
03:33:07,400 --> 03:33:10,720
We are gonna have to start having NA streams though, since we did hit our sub goal.

5073
03:33:10,920 --> 03:33:13,020
Um, our 300 sub goal.

5074
03:33:13,860 --> 03:33:18,840
So we're gonna have one NA stream a week, and our first NA stream is gonna be on Tuesday.

5075
03:33:19,080 --> 03:33:20,660
I've not decided what time yet.

5076
03:33:20,820 --> 03:33:22,580
Like, I need to figure out the time, so...

5077
03:33:23,560 --> 03:33:24,980
So I just know it's gonna be on Tuesday.

5078
03:33:25,480 --> 03:33:27,480
Um, it's gonna be a stream before 10pm.

5079
03:33:27,800 --> 03:33:28,500
That's for sure.

5080
03:33:30,900 --> 03:33:33,460
Patrick's prophecy, everyone's so ugly they all died.

5081
03:33:34,800 --> 03:33:37,440
My eyes burn when I look in the mirror too.

5082
03:33:39,840 --> 03:33:42,420
So in order to be human, we must eat humans.

5083
03:33:42,520 --> 03:33:45,340
No, in order to be a lady, you must eat the lady.

5084
03:33:47,320 --> 03:33:49,560
The lady said, damn, I'm gonna eat ugliness.

5085
03:33:49,680 --> 03:33:50,520
I'm just dying.

5086
03:33:50,640 --> 03:33:51,300
Oh my god.

5087
03:33:52,060 --> 03:33:53,680
I hope you guys had a good time.

5088
03:33:53,840 --> 03:33:55,320
I had a really good time too.

5089
03:33:56,040 --> 03:33:58,380
Um, you're the power of ugliness.

5090
03:33:58,380 --> 03:33:59,580
You out- ugliness.

5091
03:33:59,860 --> 03:34:00,300
Ugliness.

5092
03:34:02,060 --> 03:34:06,480
But I hope you guys had a good time, like, fucking watching me play this game.

5093
03:34:06,840 --> 03:34:09,380
Um, it was enough- was there 8 subs?

5094
03:34:10,180 --> 03:34:11,440
Was there really 8 subs?

5095
03:34:11,540 --> 03:34:12,860
Cause it has 304.

5096
03:34:13,580 --> 03:34:14,020
304.

5097
03:34:14,120 --> 03:34:15,880
We started with 300 though, Roy.

5098
03:34:17,260 --> 03:34:18,660
It was my first time here.

5099
03:34:19,000 --> 03:34:21,360
And, um, and that was great.

5100
03:34:21,480 --> 03:34:23,080
I'm glad you enjoyed the stream.

5101
03:34:23,620 --> 03:34:27,060
Uh, so your stream on Drunk Hour or Crackhead Hour?

5102
03:34:27,060 --> 03:34:28,500
Like, I don't know.

5103
03:34:28,560 --> 03:34:30,200
I just stream whenever, really.

5104
03:34:30,360 --> 03:34:32,280
I just be like, shit, I need a little stream.

5105
03:34:32,620 --> 03:34:35,620
And then I go be like, fuck, there- fuck, here we go.

5106
03:34:35,780 --> 03:34:35,920
Boo!

5107
03:34:37,540 --> 03:34:39,140
It is 2 AM for me.

5108
03:34:39,880 --> 03:34:40,240
Crimbo!

5109
03:34:40,360 --> 03:34:42,280
Thank you so much for the tier 1 subs!

5110
03:34:42,640 --> 03:34:43,340
Thank you!

5111
03:34:43,460 --> 03:34:43,680
Woo!

5112
03:34:43,960 --> 03:34:46,400
Can I have some break nights real quick for Crimbo?

5113
03:34:46,860 --> 03:34:48,400
Thank you, thank you, thank you, Crimbo.

5114
03:34:48,480 --> 03:34:49,340
Thank you so much.

5115
03:34:49,760 --> 03:34:50,480
Thank you guys.

5116
03:34:50,600 --> 03:34:51,280
Holy shit.

5117
03:34:51,320 --> 03:34:51,920
Okay, let me count.

5118
03:34:52,140 --> 03:34:54,120
1, 2, 3, 4.

5119

5121
03:34:58,680 --> 03:34:59,080
Uh.

5122
03:34:59,620 --> 03:35:00,020

5123
03:35:00,360 --> 03:35:00,760
Uh.

5124
03:35:02,640 --> 03:35:03,800
6, 7.

5125
03:35:04,700 --> 03:35:05,900
Oh shit, we did!

5126
03:35:06,180 --> 03:35:07,100
We did hit 8!

5127
03:35:07,260 --> 03:35:08,220
We can do a little giveaway!

5128
03:35:08,760 --> 03:35:10,200
We can do a little giveaway!

5129
03:35:11,020 --> 03:35:13,060
Um, I'm gonna, yeah, I'm gonna fuck it.

5130
03:35:13,120 --> 03:35:13,980
Let's go, let's go.

5131
03:35:14,520 --> 03:35:14,920
Um.

03:35:15,220 --> 03:35:16,140
Yeah, that's 9.

5133
03:35:16,260 --> 03:35:17,080
Your hair layers?

5134
03:35:17,220 --> 03:35:17,800
I love the stream.

5135
03:35:17,920 --> 03:35:18,960
Oh, thank you, thank you.

5136
03:35:19,160 --> 03:35:20,180
I'm glad you guys find it funny.

5137
03:35:20,260 --> 03:35:23,480
Cause I don't do a lot for- I just recently started doing more variety streams.

5138
03:35:23,700 --> 03:35:25,320
Cause I usually just stream art and stuff.

5139
03:35:25,440 --> 03:35:25,680
But, I'm glad you guys are watching.

5140
03:35:25,680 --> 03:35:29,520
But, apparently, people say I'm funny so they're like, you should do variety streams.

5141
03:35:29,660 --> 03:35:31,420
And because you're funny, it's fun to watch.

5142
03:35:31,580 --> 03:35:32,380
I'm like, fuck, am I?

5143
03:35:32,600 --> 03:35:41,020
Like, I just say, um, like, I just say like, I just say whatever comes out of my mouth.

5144
03:35:41,120 --> 03:35:47,900
So I never like, I, um, I never like really know what, uh, what I'm doing when I'm playing.

5145
03:35:48,400 --> 03:35:50,280
I usually don't stream video games.

5146
03:35:50,480 --> 03:35:52,860
This is like my second variety stream.

5147
03:35:52,860 --> 03:36:00,620
So it's like, it's like, I, I, I always get really, I get nervous about doing variety streams cause I don't know if you guys would watch it.

5148
03:36:00,700 --> 03:36:01,500
But I'm glad you do.

5149
03:36:01,620 --> 03:36:06,360
I'm glad you guys enjoy, uh, whatever I fucking say stupid shit.

5150
03:36:08,520 --> 03:36:09,880
I'm glad you guys have fun.

5151
03:36:10,040 --> 03:36:12,440
I really, I'm really happy you guys have fun about it.

5152
03:36:12,560 --> 03:36:15,740
Let me just pull up a tab so we can do our giveaway stuff.

5153
03:36:16,600 --> 03:36:22,580
Um, yeah, the music stopped cause I'm trying to, uh, trying to sell the giveaway and stuff for it.

5154
03:36:24,760 --> 03:36:30,360

03:36:36,540 --> 03:36:37,700
Um, yeah, Bordo.

5159
03:36:37,800 --> 03:36:38,500
Oh my god.

5160
03:36:38,700 --> 03:36:41,340
I messed up so I never leave unless I get modded.

5161
03:36:41,340 --> 03:36:41,960
I love it here.

5162
03:36:42,080 --> 03:36:43,640
Yeah, all our mods love it here.

5163
03:36:43,900 --> 03:36:46,420
They, they are, they, it's not Stockholm Syndrome.

5164
03:36:46,620 --> 03:36:51,460
They all, they are all willingly, will, willing, willing, consensual mods.

5165
03:36:52,040 --> 03:36:52,440
Right?

5166
03:36:52,860 --> 03:36:53,440
Let me tell you guys, I love it here.

5167
03:36:54,900 --> 03:36:57,100
Holy shit, this is a long ass credit, see?

5168
03:36:57,720 --> 03:36:59,440
I bet the mods are underpaid.

5169
03:37:01,560 --> 03:37:02,920
Idiot, they are not even paid.

5170
03:37:03,100 --> 03:37:06,680
They do it out of their- They do it for free and they paid me.

5171
03:37:10,760 --> 03:37:12,140
And the mods paid me?

5172
03:37:12,840 --> 03:37:18,240
And- Look here, you see, you see, we're coming off?

5173
03:37:18,760 --> 03:37:22,000
We're hostages anyway so we couldn't leave if we wanted to.

5174
03:37:22,440 --> 03:37:22,840
I'm leaving.

5175
03:37:32,930 --> 03:37:34,930
Oh, you made Doki for mine.

5176
03:37:37,690 --> 03:37:39,110
You can never quit.

5177
03:37:39,550 --> 03:37:41,350
You can never... Paul's almost quit.

5178
03:37:41,550 --> 03:37:42,250
Paul's like...

5179
03:37:42,250 --> 03:37:44,630
willingly let his mod get stolen.

5180
03:37:46,650 --> 03:37:48,350
Only for... I don't remember who it was.

5181
03:37:48,370 --> 03:37:50,070
Only for Alex to give him mod back.

5182
03:37:50,390 --> 03:37:53,190
He wanted to like... she's gonna eat us like she ate the lady.

5183
03:37:53,410 --> 03:37:53,850
Yeah.

5184
03:37:54,370 --> 03:37:55,510
Don't make me...

5185
03:37:55,510 --> 03:37:56,190
Oh shit.

5186
03:37:56,410 --> 03:37:56,990
What's this?

5187
03:37:57,550 --> 03:37:58,890
Why the fu... wait, what?

5188
03:38:00,270 --> 03:38:01,110
Where am I?

5189
03:38:05,940 --> 03:38:07,160
Oh, thank you for playing.

5190
03:38:07,220 --> 03:38:09,760
I thought this was... I thought I could move again.

5191
03:38:14,760 --> 03:38:18,360
That's the funny thing that happened to Marco Player when he wanted to...

5192
03:38:19,120 --> 03:38:19,520
um...

5193
03:38:19,520 --> 03:38:20,840
Then he was using the end here.

5194
03:38:20,880 --> 03:38:21,900
I took so long and I ordered food.

5195
03:38:22,040 --> 03:38:24,820
And went to pick it up and it finished when he got back.

5196
03:38:25,540 --> 03:38:26,660
Oh my god.

5197
03:38:28,140 --> 03:38:29,040
Did we go back?

5198
03:38:29,300 --> 03:38:29,560
No.

5199
03:38:29,920 --> 03:38:31,760
Okay, we're gonna do our little giveaway.

5200
03:38:31,760 --> 03:38:33,860

Every time we get like 8 subs, we do a little sketch giveaway for ourselves.

5203
03:38:39,540 --> 03:38:40,960

03:38:47,320 --> 03:38:49,140
So you should DM me about...

5210
03:38:49,140 --> 03:38:54,040
So every time we hit 8... we get 8 subs, we do a little sketch giveaway where I...

5211
03:38:54,040 --> 03:38:54,960

03:38:57,980 --> 03:38:59,720
Where they can redeem a...

5215
03:38:59,720 --> 03:39:01,420
Where they can win a little sketch from me.

5216
03:39:01,880 --> 03:39:02,380
Um...

5217
03:39:02,380 --> 03:39:03,600
So yeah, let me...

5218
03:39:03,600 --> 03:39:06,240
Let me fucking pull this up for you guys.

5219
03:39:06,380 --> 03:39:07,700
Cause I keep forgetting to do it.

5220
03:39:08,740 --> 03:39:09,240
Okay.

5221
03:39:09,860 --> 03:39:10,360
Uh...

5222
03:39:10,360 --> 03:39:11,000
Buh buh bum.

5223
03:39:13,900 --> 03:39:14,400
Alright.

5224
03:39:22,860 --> 03:39:23,360
Okay.

5225
03:39:23,540 --> 03:39:24,580
Oh my god!

5226
03:39:25,540 --> 03:39:27,300
What the fuck, Jericho!

5227
03:39:29,300 --> 03:39:30,640
Oh my god!

5228
03:39:32,780 --> 03:39:33,260
Jericho!

5229
03:39:35,140 --> 03:39:36,100

5233
03:39:39,280 --> 03:39:41,140

5234
03:39:42,040 --> 03:39:45,460
For Jericho for the fucking 7 gifted subs!

5235
03:39:46,320 --> 03:39:47,280
Holy shit!

5236
03:39:47,540 --> 03:39:49,520
Okay, so we're gonna pull up 2 winners now.

5237
03:39:49,620 --> 03:39:50,920
We're gonna pull up 2 winners.

5238
03:39:51,200 --> 03:39:52,720
Thank you so much!

5239
03:39:53,560 --> 03:39:55,460
Jericho, thank you, thank you guys.

5240
03:39:55,680 --> 03:39:57,220
I really do appreciate...

5241
03:39:57,220 --> 03:39:58,840
The one before we were allowed to enter again.

5242
03:39:58,940 --> 03:40:00,260
Because I won last stream.

5243
03:40:00,260 --> 03:40:00,660
I think.

5244
03:40:00,780 --> 03:40:01,380
Yeah, yeah.

5245
03:40:01,400 --> 03:40:02,680
If you guys won before...

5246
03:40:03,100 --> 03:40:03,300
Um...

5247
03:40:03,300 --> 03:40:04,920
You're not eligible for the...

5248
03:40:04,920 --> 03:40:05,680
For the giveaway.

5249
03:40:06,280 --> 03:40:06,680
So...

5250
03:40:06,680 --> 03:40:09,560
Cause I want like everyone who has not yet won the sketch...

5251
03:40:09,560 --> 03:40:10,060
To...

5252
03:40:10,060 --> 03:40:11,320
To have a chance to win it.

5253
03:40:11,820 --> 03:40:12,220
So...

5254
03:40:12,220 --> 03:40:14,560
But you guys can enter just to see if you'll get picked.

5255
03:40:14,720 --> 03:40:15,120
But...

5256
03:40:15,120 --> 03:40:18,960
I did finish it, God.

5257
03:40:19,040 --> 03:40:20,220
And I just finished it.

5258
03:40:20,300 --> 03:40:22,400
We just finished watching the credits and everything.

5259
03:40:22,580 --> 03:40:23,380
So I'm just gonna...

5260
03:40:23,380 --> 03:40:24,100
Um...

5261
03:40:24,100 --> 03:40:26,940
I'm gonna fucking pull up the giveaway tab real quick, guys.

5262
03:40:28,780 --> 03:40:29,180
Um...

5263
03:40:29,180 --> 03:40:29,380

03:40:29,380 --> 03:40:30,740
So let me...

5265
03:40:30,740 --> 03:40:32,920
Let me fucking pull it up for you guys.

5266
03:40:33,920 --> 03:40:34,400
Alright.

5267
03:40:34,860 --> 03:40:35,860
Where the fuck?

5268
03:40:36,120 --> 03:40:36,700
Where is it?

5269
03:40:36,720 --> 03:40:37,100
Giveaway.

5270
03:40:37,200 --> 03:40:37,740
There we go.

5271
03:40:38,760 --> 03:40:39,240
Alright.

5272
03:40:39,680 --> 03:40:40,160
Alright.

5273
03:40:40,260 --> 03:40:41,620
So if you guys see your...

5274
03:40:41,620 --> 03:40:42,380

5275
03:40:42,380 --> 03:40:43,100
Pull, pull, pull.

5276
03:40:44,000 --> 03:40:44,480
So...

5277
03:40:46,980 --> 03:40:47,940
So the...

5278
03:40:47,940 --> 03:40:49,000
The, the, the, the...

5279
03:40:49,000 --> 03:40:49,280
The, the...

5280
03:40:49,280 --> 03:40:51,260
I need to fucking do all this.

5281
03:40:53,100 --> 03:40:57,580
I need to fucking remember how to do this shit.

5282
03:40:57,780 --> 03:40:58,720
So you see...

5283
03:40:58,720 --> 03:41:01,440
The keyword is exclamation point enter.

5284
03:41:01,640 --> 03:41:02,440
So, um...

5285
03:41:02,440 --> 03:41:05,300
Just do exclamation point enter to enter the giveaway.

5286
03:41:05,580 --> 03:41:07,720
And the only rules is that...

5287
03:41:08,660 --> 03:41:09,180
Um...

5288
03:41:09,180 --> 03:41:09,540
All you...

5289
03:41:09,540 --> 03:41:09,800
Uh...

5290
03:41:09,800 --> 03:41:12,240
You just have to DM me on Discord if you get picked.

5291
03:41:12,380 --> 03:41:13,400
We're picking two winners.

5292
03:41:13,700 --> 03:41:15,020
Just DM me on Discord.

5293
03:41:15,700 --> 03:41:16,740
And, um...

5294
03:41:16,740 --> 03:41:16,960
It...

5295
03:41:16,960 --> 03:41:17,480
It can...

5296
03:41:17,480 --> 03:41:18,480
It's only a chibi sketch.

5297
03:41:18,740 --> 03:41:19,780
And it can't have...

5298
03:41:19,780 --> 03:41:20,420
There's no...

5299
03:41:20,420 --> 03:41:22,800
No over complicated designs or armor.

5300
03:41:22,880 --> 03:41:23,480
Cause I can't...

5301
03:41:23,480 --> 03:41:24,420
I can't deal with that shit.

5302
03:41:24,640 --> 03:41:25,000
I...

5303
03:41:25,840 --> 03:41:26,360
I...

5304
03:41:27,680 --> 03:41:28,200
I...

5305
03:41:28,200 --> 03:41:29,260
I'm too dumb for that.

5306
03:41:29,420 --> 03:41:30,300
Please don't.

5307
03:41:30,740 --> 03:41:31,720
Yes, titties!

5308
03:41:31,740 --> 03:41:32,840
I'll draw Bobbers!

5309
03:41:32,980 --> 03:41:34,640
I'll draw Big Bobbers if you want.

5310
03:41:34,920 --> 03:41:37,280
But just no armor and over complicated designs.

5311
03:41:37,780 --> 03:41:38,120
I...

5312
03:41:38,120 --> 03:41:38,360
I...

5313
03:41:38,360 --> 03:41:40,140
I'm not strong enough, guys.

5314
03:41:40,340 --> 03:41:41,880
I'm not strong enough for that.

5315
03:41:42,080 --> 03:41:42,960
So let me...

5316
03:41:42,960 --> 03:41:44,000
Okay, I'm gonna do a countdown.

5317
03:41:45,200 --> 03:41:45,760
Ten...

5318
03:41:46,420 --> 03:41:46,980
Nine...

5319
03:41:46,980 --> 03:41:47,860
Eight...

5320
03:41:48,460 --> 03:41:49,020
Seven...

5321
03:41:49,020 --> 03:41:50,000
Six...

5322
03:41:50,000 --> 03:41:51,000
Five...

5323
03:41:51,000 --> 03:41:51,860
Four...

5324
03:41:51,860 --> 03:41:52,800
Three...

5325
03:41:52,800 --> 03:41:53,820
Two...

5326
03:41:54,420 --> 03:41:54,980
One...

5327
03:41:55,680 --> 03:41:56,980
Victor already won.

5328
03:41:57,100 --> 03:41:57,600
So, hahaha!

5329
03:41:57,700 --> 03:41:58,180
So he's like...

5330
03:41:58,180 --> 03:42:00,140
I'm gonna re-roll again cause Victor already won.

5331
03:42:00,280 --> 03:42:04,500
Or I'm trying to roll until someone who hasn't won yet gets it.

5332
03:42:04,600 --> 03:42:07,360
I remember I've done a sketch for Victor.

5333
03:42:07,580 --> 03:42:09,020
So we're gonna do another re-roll.

5334
03:42:09,200 --> 03:42:10,380
We're gonna do another re-roll.

5335
03:42:10,760 --> 03:42:11,240
Mushikai!

5336
03:42:11,520 --> 03:42:12,000
Congratulations!

5337
03:42:13,400 --> 03:42:13,880
Congratulations!

5338
03:42:15,240 --> 03:42:15,720
Woo!

5339
03:42:16,080 --> 03:42:18,740
Just DM me on Discord of what you won for your sketch.

5340
03:42:19,360 --> 03:42:19,840
And...

5341
03:42:19,840 --> 03:42:21,420
When was this not rigged?

5342
03:42:21,760 --> 03:42:22,760
Mushikai got it!

5343
03:42:22,820 --> 03:42:24,420
They have not got the sketch before!

5344
03:42:24,960 --> 03:42:27,040
So it wasn't as rigged.

5345
03:42:27,040 --> 03:42:28,420
Okay, one more roll.

5346
03:42:29,460 --> 03:42:32,080
Uh, James, congratulations!

5347
03:42:34,340 --> 03:42:34,840

5360
03:42:57,040 --> 03:42:57,560
You guys are amazing!

5361
03:42:57,640 --> 03:42:58,380
You guys are amazing!

5362
03:42:58,720 --> 03:43:00,640
I really do appreciate it.

5363
03:43:00,800 --> 03:43:02,280
Not totally rigged!

5364
03:43:02,300 --> 03:43:03,740
Today was not a rigged day!

5365
03:43:03,920 --> 03:43:05,220
Today was not a rigged day!

5366
03:43:05,720 --> 03:43:06,480
That's crazy!

5367
03:43:09,300 --> 03:43:12,660
I just consumed cotton spit today.

5368
03:43:12,920 --> 03:43:14,260
Alright, so...

5369
03:43:15,220 --> 03:43:18,660
Thank you everyone for coming to the stream.

5370
03:43:18,980 --> 03:43:20,540
I really do appreciate it.

5371
03:43:20,560 --> 03:43:21,420
We had a fun time.

5372
03:43:21,760 --> 03:43:23,740
I honestly had a lot of fun today.

5373
03:43:23,980 --> 03:43:26,720
And I really appreciate all you guys hanging out with me.

5374
03:43:26,720 --> 03:43:30,780
And, uh, keeping me company as we try to...

5375
03:43:30,780 --> 03:43:33,460
As we finish this game in 30 minutes.

5376
03:43:33,720 --> 03:43:34,280
It's crazy.

5377
03:43:34,440 --> 03:43:37,120
I know it's sad that the stream was only 30 minutes.

5378
03:43:37,380 --> 03:43:39,020
But hey, like...

5379
03:43:42,120 --> 03:43:45,660
Damn, I'm sorry that this was only a 30 minute stream, guys.

5380
03:43:47,600 --> 03:43:49,000
Such a short stream.

5381
03:43:50,740 --> 03:43:52,280
Um, what is the Discord?

5382
03:43:52,440 --> 03:43:53,920
Can someone do an exclamation mark on Discord?

5383
03:43:54,240 --> 03:43:56,440
Uh, for them real quick?

5384
03:43:57,260 --> 03:43:57,700
Um...

5385
03:43:58,780 --> 03:44:00,720
But yeah, I'm just too good at this game.

5386
03:44:00,780 --> 03:44:00,940
Yeah.

5387
03:44:01,060 --> 03:44:01,800
I was insane.

5388
03:44:02,080 --> 03:44:03,900
I was looking speedrunning this.

5389
03:44:04,020 --> 03:44:06,420
I was buddy-hopping and everything, guys.

5390
03:44:06,740 --> 03:44:07,440
I mean...

5391
03:44:08,360 --> 03:44:09,240
But yeah, guys.

5392
03:44:09,420 --> 03:44:11,040
Thank you everyone for the follows.

5393
03:44:11,160 --> 03:44:12,360
For the raids today.

5394
03:44:12,640 --> 03:44:14,040
For the love and support.

5395
03:44:14,380 --> 03:44:15,900
I really appreciate it.

5396
03:44:15,920 --> 03:44:17,920
I'll see you guys tomorrow for Visage.

5397
03:44:18,700 --> 03:44:19,140
Anyway...

5398
03:44:19,140 --> 03:44:19,860
Um...

5399
03:44:19,860 --> 03:44:20,200
Yeah.

5400
03:44:20,580 --> 03:44:21,260
Bye, guys!
