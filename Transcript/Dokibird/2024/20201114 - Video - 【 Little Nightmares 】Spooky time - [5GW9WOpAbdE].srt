224
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:50,480
I forgot to change it.

225
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,180

Oh.

234
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:15,010
Apparently I can't climb.

235
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:19,350
The mug used to climb in chat.

236
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:34,060
Okay.

237
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:37,180

There's a fall damage here!

240
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:57,170
There's a fall damage!

241
00:17:57,690 --> 00:17:58,170

242
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:02,730
Why the fuck is there fall damage?

243
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:05,070

00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:14,630
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

248
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,570
You can't know there's fall damage.

249
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:21,030
Okay, look, I have a bed.

250
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:22,890

251
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:25,170

Whoa.

255
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:33,730
Okay, how the fuck was I supposed to know there was fall
damage here?

256
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:37,490
Okay, I gotta get past this checkpoint, so I don't have to
do that again.

257
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:42,530
Also, is the sound okay for you guys?

258
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:43,710
The sound of the game?

259
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:45,550
Because I- Oh, oh my god, what the fuck!

260
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:49,150
I forgot about that.

261
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:52,970
Because I don't know if you guys can hear the game sound.

262
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:56,650
Because it's, like, very atmospheric.

263
00:18:58,990 --> 00:18:59,390
Okay.

264
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:02,590

Where does it take me?

00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:08,530
Wait.

Is there a point going up?

00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,340
Oh, no.

304
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:19,340
There's no reason for me to climb.

305
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:19,820
Why not?

306
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,980

10 minutes.

334
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:40,530
Oh, shit.

335
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:41,630

00:42:51,770 --> 00:42:52,850
I'm so confused.

615
00:42:53,810 --> 00:42:57,030

00:42:58,490 --> 00:42:58,890

I think, like, I thought it was spooky.

623
00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:18,050
But, but it wasn't as spooky as I thought.

624
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:20,330
It was just atmospheric.

625
00:43:20,870 --> 00:43:21,290
Oh my gosh.

626
00:43:21,470 --> 00:43:21,810

Visage is scary, right?

647
00:44:58,130 --> 00:45:00,550
I want to gradually get scarier.

Alright, we're gonna play Massage next stream.

655
00:45:16,650 --> 00:45:19,690
Because I wanted to gradually get spookier each game.

656
00:45:28,730 --> 00:45:32,270
But, like, I'm going into each game blind, so I don't know
what the fuck is going on.

657
00:45:34,550 --> 00:45:35,610
Like, I don't know what the fuck is.

658

I don't know what the story is.

659

00:52:54,450 --> 00:52:56,290
They do little bunny hops like this.

773
00:52:56,930 --> 00:52:58,650
No, there's no pressure plate here though.

774

Oh, wait, no.

886
00:59:38,270 --> 00:59:39,130
That's not a dog.

887
00:59:39,270 --> 00:59:40,430
Wait, that's not a dog.

888
00:59:40,550 --> 00:59:42,330
I thought I was...

889
00:59:42,330 --> 00:59:43,490
I thought I was a dog.

890
00:59:43,950 --> 00:59:47,570
I just had to look closer.

891
00:59:47,870 --> 00:59:49,670
I don't know what the fuck that was.

892
00:59:50,890 --> 00:59:54,570
But his nose was a big peepee on Angie right there.

893
00:59:56,390 --> 00:59:57,150
Is it timed?

894
01:00:04,330 --> 01:00:05,230
What are you speaking?

895
01:00:05,350 --> 01:00:07,830
Does this mean the complete opposite for me?

896
01:00:12,830 --> 01:00:13,330
Okay.

897
01:00:14,050 --> 01:00:14,810
Where did I go?

898
01:00:16,350 --> 01:00:16,790
Here?

899
01:00:17,990 --> 01:00:19,870
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

900
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:26,470
That was not where I go.

901
01:00:27,090 --> 01:00:28,850
That was not where I go.

902
01:00:31,170 --> 01:00:33,030
Oh, I have to push it again.

903
01:00:33,270 --> 01:00:33,710
No!

904
01:00:36,890 --> 01:00:37,370
No!

905
01:00:41,060 --> 01:00:44,480
Why couldn't they just give me the suitcase where it was?

906
01:00:53,290 --> 01:00:55,970
I wonder how far we are already in this game.

907
01:00:57,330 --> 01:00:59,890
Because it's supposed to be a two to three hour game.

908
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:02,570
And I'm already- I've already played this game for ten
minutes.

909
01:01:02,590 --> 01:01:03,090
minutes.

910
01:01:05,630 --> 01:01:07,070
Why is it so spooky?

911
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:15,880
What's the spooky noise for?

912
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:22,540
Okay, clearly the light has no meaning.

913
01:01:23,100 --> 01:01:23,800
Oh, shit!

914
01:01:24,620 --> 01:01:25,180
Who you?

915
01:01:25,860 --> 01:01:26,920
Who you, mister?

916
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:31,980
He doesn't have hair, and he's wearing a hat.

917
01:01:32,180 --> 01:01:32,860
You know what I say?

918
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:33,720
We don't need hair.

919
01:01:34,180 --> 01:01:34,980
Just wear a hat.

920
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:36,880
He's okay.

921
01:01:37,020 --> 01:01:37,580
He looks okay.

922
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:39,760
What the fuck is this on ice?

923
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:41,100
Oh!

924
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:43,500
Oh, no, no, no, no!

925
01:01:44,540 --> 01:01:46,100
I'm gonna turn you on?

926
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:47,340
Hey.

927
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:51,380
Okay, I guess I do that again?

928
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:53,020
Because I fucked up?

929
01:01:58,380 --> 01:02:00,020
True, I'm probably almost done.

930
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:01,200
Oh, there's a key.

931
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:02,820
There's a key down there!

932
01:02:04,340 --> 01:02:05,980
I didn't see the key.

933
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,280
I didn't use the key then.

934
01:02:10,740 --> 01:02:12,520
Okay, key.

935
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:15,140
Key.

01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:19,180

937
01:02:24,260 --> 01:02:26,360
Okay, I thought I died there.

01:02:26,740 --> 01:02:29,660

01:34:13,320 --> 01:34:13,720
He doesn't know.

1423
01:34:13,840 --> 01:34:14,260
He doesn't know.

1424
01:34:14,400 --> 01:34:15,020
Okay, he knows.

1425
01:34:19,020 --> 01:34:20,520
Okay, I think he knew.

1426
01:34:22,380 --> 01:34:24,260
I thought I could camouflage!

1427
01:34:25,800 --> 01:34:27,500
There's so many of me!

1428
01:34:31,780 --> 01:34:32,920
What do I do?

1429
01:34:34,380 --> 01:34:36,400
What the fuck do you want from me?

1430
01:34:37,220 --> 01:34:39,320
What do you want from me?

1431
01:34:45,690 --> 01:34:47,610
Climb so many things, Roy.

1432
01:34:50,870 --> 01:34:51,190
Okay.

1433
01:35:07,950 --> 01:35:09,090
Please, let me climb.

1434
01:35:09,310 --> 01:35:10,030
This, let me climb.

1435
01:35:10,270 --> 01:35:10,590
Let me climb.

1436
01:35:10,790 --> 01:35:11,130
Let me climb.

1437
01:35:11,130 --> 01:35:11,650
No!

1438
01:35:16,050 --> 01:35:17,930
Wait, let me climb.

1439
01:35:18,730 --> 01:35:20,530
Boy, did it let me climb.

1440
01:35:23,230 --> 01:35:25,890
Wait, I just want to climb.

1441
01:35:28,970 --> 01:35:30,510
Okay, I got this.

1442
01:35:31,170 --> 01:35:32,110
I got this.

1443
01:35:33,510 --> 01:35:34,470
And we're getting closer.

1444
01:35:35,090 --> 01:35:35,970
We're getting closer.

1445
01:35:39,470 --> 01:35:42,310
Okay, maybe I just need to throw the monkey farther away.

1446
01:35:42,950 --> 01:35:43,690
That's it.

1447
01:35:44,030 --> 01:35:45,190
The monkey just needs to be farther.

1448
01:35:46,390 --> 01:35:50,590
I just need to throw this monkey farther away.

1449
01:35:51,110 --> 01:35:54,030
Oh, here we go.

1450
01:35:55,010 --> 01:35:55,530
Yeah.

1451
01:36:00,750 --> 01:36:01,530
Wait, what the fuck?

1452
01:36:01,710 --> 01:36:02,690
Why are you so fast?

1453
01:36:06,150 --> 01:36:07,950
Why are you so fast?

1454
01:36:12,310 --> 01:36:13,670
He heard me?

1455
01:36:14,150 --> 01:36:15,850
Holy shit, come on!

1456
01:36:16,350 --> 01:36:17,630
You don't even have ears!

1457
01:36:18,290 --> 01:36:19,050
You don't even have ears!

1458
01:36:19,070 --> 01:36:20,910
Okay, maybe, okay, you do, because you can hear...

1459
01:36:20,910 --> 01:36:21,270
Oh, you do.

1460
01:36:21,350 --> 01:36:22,830
You actually do have ears.

1461
01:36:24,290 --> 01:36:25,710
He does have ears.

1462
01:36:28,270 --> 01:36:28,810
Okay.

1463
01:36:29,350 --> 01:36:30,950
It'll work, swanne.

1464
01:36:34,910 --> 01:36:35,450
Okay.

1465
01:36:35,750 --> 01:36:35,970
Okay.

1466
01:36:36,510 --> 01:36:37,970
We just need to keep trying.

1467
01:36:38,330 --> 01:36:39,910
We know what to do.

1468
01:36:40,370 --> 01:36:41,310
He hurt the monkey.

1469
01:36:42,110 --> 01:36:42,310
Ugh.

1470
01:36:46,680 --> 01:36:47,220
Monkey.

1471
01:36:47,780 --> 01:36:48,800
Go for the monkey.

1472
01:36:49,800 --> 01:36:50,720
Is monkey too far?

1473
01:36:51,960 --> 01:36:52,940
Monkey too far.

1474
01:36:57,380 --> 01:37:01,120
Oh, here we go.

1475
01:37:02,080 --> 01:37:02,920
Monkey!

1476
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:05,300
Yeah.

1477
01:37:09,790 --> 01:37:11,190
No!

1478
01:37:12,530 --> 01:37:13,630

It's so easy, first try.

1502
01:39:00,200 --> 01:39:03,800
I didn't think that would work.

1503
01:39:05,080 --> 01:39:05,480
Boom.

01:39:06,320 --> 01:39:07,320

1520
01:40:09,820 --> 01:40:11,220
Can I even climb up this?

1521
01:40:11,800 --> 01:40:12,200
No.

1522
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:16,940
Okay, I need to, like, figure out what this is.

1523
01:40:17,500 --> 01:40:18,280

What are you?

1528
01:40:25,500 --> 01:40:26,680
I'm so confused.

1529
01:40:27,880 --> 01:40:28,780
Did I push this?

1530
01:40:29,620 --> 01:40:30,360
What are you?

1531
01:40:30,940 --> 01:40:31,200

01:40:31,320 --> 01:40:31,620

01:40:32,040 --> 01:40:35,400
I- It's easy.

1534
01:40:36,360 --> 01:40:37,400
Just don't die.

1535
01:40:37,560 --> 01:40:38,440
Oh shit, you're right.

1536
01:40:38,880 --> 01:40:39,400
You're right.

1537
01:40:42,840 --> 01:40:43,720
I do this.

1538
01:40:44,060 --> 01:40:45,360
And then I go, whoa!

1539
01:40:50,400 --> 01:40:51,520
And then...

1540
01:40:51,520 --> 01:40:52,680
And then...

1541
01:40:52,680 --> 01:40:53,740
I don't know.

1542
01:40:54,160 --> 01:40:56,060
I don't know what to do after this part.

1543
01:40:56,660 --> 01:40:57,220
He doesn't know.

1544
01:40:57,620 --> 01:40:58,400
I'm in the dark.

1545
01:40:58,780 --> 01:40:59,740
You don't know where I am.

1546
01:41:00,040 --> 01:41:00,440
I'm in the dark!

1547
01:41:00,740 --> 01:41:01,000
Okay.

1548
01:41:02,620 --> 01:41:03,720
Do you not just go back?

1549
01:41:03,740 --> 01:41:05,100
Maybe I go forward.

1550
01:41:05,840 --> 01:41:07,240
Maybe I don't go backwards.

1551
01:41:08,040 --> 01:41:09,800
Maybe I just go forward.

1552
01:41:10,440 --> 01:41:12,560
Like a normal person.

1553
01:41:14,680 --> 01:41:16,540
Maybe I don't run in a dead end.

1554
01:41:18,500 --> 01:41:20,680
I feel like maybe I should just went forward.

1555
01:41:23,400 --> 01:41:23,940
Okay.

1556
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:25,340
Okay.

1557
01:41:26,720 --> 01:41:26,860
Oh.

1558
01:41:27,500 --> 01:41:27,880
Oh.

1559
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:28,200
Oh.

1560
01:41:28,200 --> 01:41:28,240
Oh.

1561
01:41:28,240 --> 01:41:28,360
No.

1562
01:41:28,700 --> 01:41:29,120
No.

1563
01:41:29,300 --> 01:41:29,820
That wasn't it.

1564
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:30,620
That wasn't it.

1565
01:41:32,360 --> 01:41:32,900
Okay.

1566
01:41:35,180 --> 01:41:36,220
That wasn't...

1567
01:41:36,220 --> 01:41:37,400
That wasn't it.

1568
01:41:37,700 --> 01:41:39,320
Forward was not the answer.

1569
01:41:40,580 --> 01:41:41,980
Forward was not the answer.

1570
01:41:43,140 --> 01:41:43,940
I'm so...

1571
01:41:43,940 --> 01:41:44,180
What?

1572
01:41:45,200 --> 01:41:49,360
I had to do a hard clicking puzzle, and now you want me to
do another hard puzzle?

1573
01:41:49,860 --> 01:41:50,820
Back to back?

1574
01:41:51,160 --> 01:41:52,540
What is wrong with you?

1575
01:41:52,800 --> 01:41:55,060
I need to recharge my brain.

1576
01:41:57,360 --> 01:41:58,400
Okay, maybe...

1577
01:41:58,400 --> 01:41:59,420
Maybe...

1578
01:41:59,420 --> 01:42:02,300
Maybe I take the shoe, and I throw the shoe.

1579
01:42:02,860 --> 01:42:03,440
Give me a shoe.

1580
01:42:03,740 --> 01:42:04,360
Give me your shoe.

1581
01:42:04,680 --> 01:42:05,800
Give me, give me the shoe.

1582
01:42:06,120 --> 01:42:08,560
No, let me, let me throw this first.

1583
01:42:08,820 --> 01:42:10,560
Let me, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get.

We're doing a spooky game right now, but it's not as spooky.

02:44:38,530 --> 02:44:40,430
We're waiting for this freak to get out.

2464
02:44:41,410 --> 02:44:42,090
Please leave.

2465
02:44:42,810 --> 02:44:48,310

Okay.

02:44:55,550 --> 02:44:56,350
What's on the door?

2471
02:44:59,270 --> 02:45:01,850
Why wouldn't it let me go up?

2472
02:45:03,110 --> 02:45:03,690
Wait, what?

2473
02:45:03,890 --> 02:45:04,990
I can turn it again.

2474
02:45:06,610 --> 02:45:07,390
What the fuck?

2475
02:45:09,490 --> 02:45:10,910
I'm so confused.

2476
02:45:12,330 --> 02:45:13,630
I'm so confused.

2477
02:45:21,350 --> 02:45:23,030
How do I get to the hooks, though?

2478
02:45:23,870 --> 02:45:25,070
How do I get up to you?

2479
02:45:25,390 --> 02:45:26,270
You're so tall.

2480
02:45:28,810 --> 02:45:30,390
I don't want to do this again.

2481
02:45:30,550 --> 02:45:31,990
I need to do it.

2482
02:45:34,720 --> 02:45:37,060
Okay, I gotta...

2483
02:45:37,060 --> 02:45:38,280
I'll make it past here.

2484
02:45:43,080 --> 02:45:43,520
Stupid.

2485
02:45:46,100 --> 02:45:47,000
I'm just gonna hide here.

2486
02:45:49,320 --> 02:45:49,760
Okay.

2487
02:45:50,380 --> 02:45:50,680
Alright.

2488
02:45:51,040 --> 02:45:52,580

2489
02:45:53,480 --> 02:45:54,080
Okay.

2490
02:45:55,180 --> 02:45:56,760
Oh, one scary.

Okay, thank you so much, the bids are on.

2492

Okay, all right.

02:46:03,480 --> 02:46:04,760
I'm looking respectfully.

2496
02:46:06,000 --> 02:46:07,060
The dish tower.

2497
02:46:07,220 --> 02:46:08,240
Oh, there's a dish tower.

2498
02:46:08,640 --> 02:46:08,800
Okay.

2499
02:46:09,580 --> 02:46:11,460
I was like, what dish tower?

2500
02:46:12,960 --> 02:46:14,660
I'm looking respectfully.

2501
02:46:20,530 --> 02:46:21,350
Please leave.

Oh my god.

2506
02:46:35,930 --> 02:46:37,810
Why you keep washing your dishes?

2507
02:46:39,330 --> 02:46:40,790
Just buying new plates?

2508
02:46:47,890 --> 02:46:48,690
Oh, I get up.

2509
02:46:48,910 --> 02:46:49,970
How do I go up?

2510
02:46:50,070 --> 02:46:51,190
I'm getting up.

2511
02:46:51,330 --> 02:46:52,290
I'm getting up.

2512
02:46:53,370 --> 02:46:53,610

Oh, please!

02:47:00,190 --> 02:47:00,990
You can't get me!

2523
02:47:01,310 --> 02:47:02,730
I don't know.

2524
02:47:08,590 --> 02:47:09,610
What are you gonna do?

2525
02:47:11,150 --> 02:47:12,290
What are you gonna do?

2526
02:47:13,250 --> 02:47:13,770
Nothing.

2527
02:47:16,770 --> 02:47:17,570
Oh, wait.

2528
02:47:17,910 --> 02:47:18,190
Wait.

2529
02:47:20,210 --> 02:47:20,550
Whoa.

2530
02:47:21,150 --> 02:47:21,350
No.

2531
02:47:21,950 --> 02:47:22,430
No.

2532
02:47:24,070 --> 02:47:24,250
No.

2533
02:47:28,170 --> 02:47:28,590
No.

2534
02:47:28,590 --> 02:47:28,610
No.

2535
02:47:28,610 --> 02:47:29,730
He doesn't know.

2536
02:47:29,790 --> 02:47:30,790
He doesn't know.

2537
02:47:31,030 --> 02:47:31,390
He doesn't know.

2538
02:47:31,650 --> 02:47:32,070
He doesn't know.

2539
02:47:32,390 --> 02:47:32,450
He doesn't know.

2540
02:47:32,450 --> 02:47:32,810
He doesn't know.

2541
02:47:33,190 --> 02:47:33,890
He doesn't know.

2542
02:47:35,510 --> 02:47:35,770
Wait.

2543
02:47:36,210 --> 02:47:36,330
Ah.

2544
02:47:40,450 --> 02:47:42,770
Yeah, it's freaking idiot.

2545
02:47:43,250 --> 02:47:47,310
Look at that, so good.

2546
02:47:51,810 --> 02:47:52,790
That's right.

2547
02:47:54,030 --> 02:47:55,790
The broken bottle on you.

2548
02:47:58,250 --> 02:48:04,210
The fear of trying to do that again made me fucking love,
made me like speedrun that shit.

2549
02:48:04,530 --> 02:48:05,830
I did not want to do that again.

2550
02:48:07,310 --> 02:48:09,170
I did not want to wait again.

2551
02:48:09,710 --> 02:48:12,570
I didn't want to fucking wait and hide again.

2552
02:48:16,270 --> 02:48:18,110
Well, I washed dishes when you just buy new ones.

2553
02:48:19,550 --> 02:48:19,990
Exactly.

2554
02:48:20,830 --> 02:48:23,030
This is like, you know what the biggest brain is?

2555
02:48:23,130 --> 02:48:26,090
Just buy paper plates and then recycle them when you're
done.

2556
02:48:26,650 --> 02:48:28,130
Like, you never have to do dishes.

2557
02:48:28,310 --> 02:48:30,690
You just recycle your plates afterwards.

2558
02:48:30,890 --> 02:48:31,890
Isn't that so smart?

2559
02:48:32,270 --> 02:48:32,790
That's a...

2560
02:48:40,370 --> 02:48:41,330
Look at that.

2561
02:48:41,790 --> 02:48:42,510
I'm bee hopping.

2562
02:48:42,630 --> 02:48:43,710
I'm bee hopping.

2563
02:48:45,930 --> 02:48:49,990
That run felt like a Super Bowl touchdown run.

2564
02:48:59,570 --> 02:49:00,030
Holy shit.

2565
02:49:00,470 --> 02:49:01,230
Convenient ladder.

2566
02:49:01,670 --> 02:49:02,270
No, right?

2567
02:49:04,070 --> 02:49:05,210
That seagull?

2568
02:49:05,830 --> 02:49:06,710
Holy shit!

2569
02:49:08,150 --> 02:49:08,990
Is that land?

2570
02:49:09,110 --> 02:49:09,330
Oh, no.

2571
02:49:09,490 --> 02:49:10,210
That's just boats.

2572
02:49:11,450 --> 02:49:12,110
Look at them.

2573
02:49:12,490 --> 02:49:13,150
Look at them.

Okay, okay, clearly, wait, okay, this time I can do it.

What else are you supposed to- See?

2581
02:50:05,930 --> 02:50:08,810
I just didn't know what to send up my directions.

2582
02:50:14,630 --> 02:50:16,270
I was just blind.

2583
02:50:16,450 --> 02:50:17,490
I don't fucking know.

2584
02:50:19,190 --> 02:50:22,310
I just didn't know my directions, clearly.

2585
02:50:22,850 --> 02:50:23,330
Okay.

2586
02:50:28,630 --> 02:50:31,690
Here, I'm so- holy shit, how big is this ship?

2587
02:50:33,950 --> 02:50:36,150
Look at this big ass boat.

2588
02:50:39,660 --> 02:50:41,660
Damn perception, yeah.

2589
02:50:44,520 --> 02:50:45,780
Oh, look, there's a seagull.

2590
02:50:46,380 --> 02:50:46,820
Look at there.

2591
02:50:47,500 --> 02:50:48,980
Look at the size of a seagull.

2592
02:50:54,830 --> 02:50:55,610
Look at him.

2593
02:50:58,490 --> 02:50:59,990
Look at him over there.

2594
02:51:00,810 --> 02:51:02,930
Look at him.

2595
02:51:07,880 --> 02:51:10,260
Jesus Christ You're big boys

I jumped and freaked out because I didn't know there was
shit below me.

2601
02:52:01,930 --> 02:52:03,250
Speedrunner skipping the cut.

2602
02:52:03,270 --> 02:52:04,330
There were cutscenes?

2603
02:52:04,650 --> 02:52:06,630
No, it was just like fucking chonkers.

2604
02:52:07,410 --> 02:52:08,090
Look at them.

2605
02:52:08,670 --> 02:52:09,710
Look at these chonkers.

2606
02:52:12,030 --> 02:52:13,350
Almost detective fart.

2607
02:52:15,970 --> 02:52:18,730
There's a really good fear I still won't share because
spoilers.

2608
02:52:19,310 --> 02:52:20,990
It's been 20 minutes, 30 minutes ago.

Look at her.

02:52:38,190 --> 02:52:40,210

2730
02:59:55,280 --> 02:59:56,780

03:00:36,820 --> 03:00:37,240

No, not you.

Not you.

2776
03:03:01,670 --> 03:03:02,810
Leave me alone.

2777
03:03:04,030 --> 03:03:05,470
Leave me alone.

2778
03:03:06,230 --> 03:03:07,370
I'm gonna get out of here.

2779
03:03:07,730 --> 03:03:08,070
Toilet.

2780
03:03:10,450 --> 03:03:11,070
He doesn't know.

2781
03:03:11,310 --> 03:03:11,970
He doesn't know.

2782
03:03:16,090 --> 03:03:18,350
Leave me alone.

2783
03:03:26,350 --> 03:03:27,310
Toilet paper.

2784
03:03:27,630 --> 03:03:34,350
I need

2785
03:03:41,670 --> 03:03:43,590
to hug it for comfort.

2786
03:03:46,170 --> 03:03:47,330
Okay, I have to go up here.

2787
03:03:48,090 --> 03:03:48,570
How do I?

2788
03:03:49,770 --> 03:03:51,010
How do I go up?

2789
03:03:51,390 --> 03:03:51,610
Up.

2790
03:03:52,470 --> 03:03:53,310
Okay, not like that.

2791
03:03:55,090 --> 03:03:57,130
True horror is if he starts pooping.

2792
03:03:57,250 --> 03:03:57,990
Oh my god.

2793
03:03:58,430 --> 03:03:59,990
I do not need that.

2794
03:04:00,030 --> 03:04:01,390
ASMR right now.

2795
03:04:01,570 --> 03:04:05,130
I do not need the poop ASMR from this game.

2796
03:04:12,480 --> 03:04:13,120
How do they flush?

2797
03:04:13,980 --> 03:04:15,500
They don't have any flushers.

2798
03:04:16,880 --> 03:04:20,600
Pull a vanguard because they didn't go down the toilet tree.

2799
03:04:24,160 --> 03:04:24,260
Oh.

2800
03:04:24,640 --> 03:04:28,160
It's hiding with the paper, not like he grabbed and wiped
his ass out.

2801
03:04:31,820 --> 03:04:32,660
Okay, okay.

2802
03:04:33,920 --> 03:04:35,240
Then you have to do this, right?

2803
03:04:35,780 --> 03:04:36,440
Okay, no.

2804
03:04:36,700 --> 03:04:39,380
That skin looks like, looks like a bath.

2805
03:04:40,400 --> 03:04:40,400
Boom.

We don't keep running straight.

2897
03:09:25,580 --> 03:09:28,560
I have learned that it's just not only straight.

2898
03:09:29,220 --> 03:09:30,340
It's not just straight.

They're just chilling.

2917

Okay, let me go this way.

03:31:38,910 --> 03:31:39,190
The gnomes.

3163
03:31:40,750 --> 03:31:41,390
What are your games?

3164
03:31:41,490 --> 03:31:42,090
I don't know yet.

3165
03:31:42,170 --> 03:31:43,450
I haven't decided yet.

3166
03:31:43,790 --> 03:31:46,570
But yeah, I'm like really honestly.

3167
03:31:46,710 --> 03:31:48,210
I decided games like two out.

3168
03:31:48,250 --> 03:31:50,490
Like I think like I decided games very last minute.

3169
03:31:50,990 --> 03:31:54,630
So I don't know what we're going to do after.

3170
03:31:54,630 --> 03:31:55,550
After Vassage.

3171
03:31:55,950 --> 03:31:57,950
Seven, eight, nine, but six, eight, or four.

3172
03:31:58,170 --> 03:31:59,230
Oh my God, yes.

3173
03:31:59,870 --> 03:32:07,410
Also that the lady wanted to be the most beautiful and made
this place to make sure everyone ate too much and became

3174
03:32:07,410 --> 03:32:07,590
fat.

3175
03:32:07,630 --> 03:32:08,770
Oh, so they were ugly.

3176
03:32:09,510 --> 03:32:10,710
So they were ugly.

3177
03:32:10,910 --> 03:32:11,810
I knew it.

3178
03:32:14,030 --> 03:32:16,510
So I wasn't being mean when I called them ugly.

3179
03:32:20,630 --> 03:32:23,350
And she might have had an accent, hence the mask.

3180
03:32:23,690 --> 03:32:26,490
And while all mirrors were broken, she died due to her
reflection.

3181
03:32:26,490 --> 03:32:36,450
oh shit so she was ugly too and she died i heard a little
sesame sheet number that she's very scary game to play which

know it's going to be on Tuesday.

3188
03:33:25,930 --> 03:33:27,750
It's going to be a stream before 10 p.m.

3189
03:33:28,030 --> 03:33:28,910
That's for sure.

3190
03:33:31,010 --> 03:33:31,790
Patrick's Prophecy.

3191
03:33:31,910 --> 03:33:32,790
Everyone was so ugly.

3192
03:33:33,070 --> 03:33:33,770
They all died.

3193
03:33:35,210 --> 03:33:37,710
My eyes burn when I look in the mirror too.

3194
03:33:39,990 --> 03:33:42,670
So in order to be human, we must eat humans.

3195
03:33:42,830 --> 03:33:45,550
No, in order to be a lady, you must eat the lady.

3196
03:33:47,630 --> 03:33:49,510
The lady said, damn, I won't eat ugly.

3197
03:33:49,650 --> 03:33:50,650
I guess I'll just die.

3198
03:33:51,010 --> 03:33:51,450
Oh my god.

3199
03:33:52,190 --> 03:33:53,890
I hope you guys had a good time.

3200
03:33:54,030 --> 03:33:55,690
I had a really good time, too.

3201
03:33:57,010 --> 03:33:58,490
You're the power of ugliness.

3202
03:33:58,830 --> 03:34:00,430
You out-uglied the ugliness.

3203
03:34:02,410 --> 03:34:06,730
But I hope you guys had a good time, like, looking, watching
me play this game.

3204
03:34:08,230 --> 03:34:08,690
There was enough.

3205
03:34:08,730 --> 03:34:09,630
Was there eight subs?

3206
03:34:10,530 --> 03:34:11,550
Was there really eight subs?

3207
03:34:11,690 --> 03:34:13,110
Because that's 304.

3208
03:34:13,670 --> 03:34:14,150
304.

3209
03:34:14,230 --> 03:34:16,010
We started with 300, though, Roy.

3210
03:34:17,410 --> 03:34:19,130
It was my first time here.

3211
03:34:19,730 --> 03:34:21,570
