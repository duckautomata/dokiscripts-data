1
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,060
Guys, I am not doing okay.

2
00:01:54,220 --> 00:02:02,440
If I sound different to you, it is because I knew I forgot to do something.

3
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,380
Or like maybe many things.

4
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,300
But one of the things I forgot to do...

5
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,040
Okay, let me turn myself down.

6
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:17,200
I'm a mess right now.

7
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:27,320
My audio settings is really not good at the moment, chat.

8
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:32,140
I forgot to save my audio settings.

9
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,560
I saved the wrong word.

10
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:40,060
I loaded in the wrong settings.

11
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,280
I saved the wrong one.

12
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,760
So basically, I use GoXLR.

13
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,960
Because I'm stupid.

14
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:54,320
And GoXLR is like the baby mixing thing.

15
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:58,380
So the thing is, there are two profiles you can save.

16
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,120
So the thing is, there are two profiles you can save.

17
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:09,000
So I saved the wrong one.

18
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,660
The profile I saved...

19
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:16,500
where it adjusts the volume of your stuff.

20
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:21,260
I didn't realize there are two different profiles.

21
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:32,140
I saved the one where it just gives you the set volume.

22
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,380
Not my mic settings.

23
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,100
So I was like playing around with my...

24
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:41,480
I like...

25
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,620
The thing is...

26
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:43,760
The thing is...

27
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:46,420
I didn't realize I like...

28
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:48,260
fucked up my mic settings.

29
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:49,300
Because I did...

30
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,720
The reason being...

31
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,060
Is that...

32
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,740
I did...

33
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,280
Thought about it and be like...

34
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,260
Oh, what if I fuck up?

35
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:59,420
Alright, I'm going to take a screenshot of my mic settings.

36
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,380
Just in case...

37
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:03,580
I am going to take a screenshot.

38
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,220
But the thing is...

39
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,940
I accidentally adjusted something.

40
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,380
On it.

41
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,400
I accidentally adjusted something.

42
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,440
On the setting.

43
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:14,920
But then I was like...

44
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,720
It's okay.

45
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:16,780
I'll just like...

46
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:18,380
I'll just like...

47
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,900
Delete that profile.

48
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,160
And then like...

49
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,100
Copy it.

50
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,140
Because I already copied.

51
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:23,540
I was like...

52
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:24,180
Oh, that's okay.

53
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,820
I copied and pasted the profile.

54
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,040
So it will like...

55
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,860
Make sure it like...

56
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:28,540
Stays the same.

57
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,720
But I copied and pasted...

58
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,520
The volume profile.

59
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:37,640
The volume profile.

60
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,560
Not the mic profile.

61
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,940
So I ended up not...

62
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:47,100
I ended up screenshotting.

63
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,980
The settings that I fucked up.

64
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,760
So I was just like...

65
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,780
I was just like...

66
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:54,560
Oh no!

67
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,300
So I had like...

68
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,560
A screenshot of like all of the mic settings.

69
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,080
But it's the one where I fucked it up.

70
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,160
I don't know which one I fucked up.

71
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,260
I don't know which one I adjusted.

72
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,640
So like...

73
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:05,840
I...

74
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,580
I sound so weird.

75
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,060
I'm sorry.

76
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:12,380
I'm sorry everybody.

77
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:12,860
I hate it.

78
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:13,620
I hate it.

79
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:16,600
The thing is... but... but... no no no no no.

80
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,560
But the thing is... I still have that profile.

81
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:26,840
I'm gonna have to unplug this PC and plug in my old PC back.

82
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,980
So I can grab

83
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,640
my mic profile.

84
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:37,740
It's

85
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:42,060
good.

86
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,640
I had to unplug it anyway.

87
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:46,520
I have... the thing is though chat.

88
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:49,320
I have to unplug it anyway.

89
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:54,320
Because I didn't realize... the thing is... I didn't realize that...

90
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:59,420
This PC only has one SSD.

91
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,680
It only has one driver.

92
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,160
So because it only has one driver...

93
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:10,060
I have to go back to the store and add another driver.

94
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:15,140
Because I didn't realize it's only one driver.

95
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,200
So... yeah it's only one.

96
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,300
I mean it's...

97
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:19,660
It's free.

98
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,640
I can't complain.

99
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,500
The PC is literally free.

100
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,680
So I can't complain.

101
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,660
So like I have to add another driver in here.

102
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,280
So...

103
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:36,720
I'm not risking adding my old drivers to the new one.

104
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:40,880
Because like I don't know what fucked up in my old PC.

105
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:42,260
This is the thing.

106
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:46,180
I don't know like what it was in my old PC.

107
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,660
That's like...

108
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:48,640
Fucking...

109
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,760
Like killing my PC.

110
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:54,860
Like I don't know what type of cancer my PC has.

111
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:57,940
So like I'm worried like if I...

112
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,880
It's okay just like think of it like...

113
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,200
Think of it like I don't know something terminal.

114
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:04,180
A PC has something terminal.

115
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:08,660
And like if I bring that terminal disease into my new PC...

116
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,520
It's gonna spread to my new PC.

117
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:14,380
So I need to make sure.

118
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:16,780
I need...

119
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:21,060
I need to make sure that it doesn't cross paths.

120
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,720
Like I don't want to contaminate it.

121
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:24,620
So...

122
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,420
So that is why.

123
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:30,100
We need to contain it into the old body.

124
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:33,160
We can't spread it to this new PC.

125
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,940
Anyways sound guy.

126
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:36,020
Am I too loud?

127
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:36,980
I don't...

128
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:37,780
I don't know.

129
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:40,500
I'm using one of the default settings.

130
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,640
Because when I try to put it...

131
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,560
Okay I'll show you guys what it sounds.

132
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,760
When I try to put it...

133
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,360
When I try to put it on my old PC.

134
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,980
Like my default settings.

135
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,140
Okay let me save this one.

136
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,760
Because this was like the only saving grace I have.

137
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,760
Alright this is basically what I sound like.

138
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,560
With my old settings.

139
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,680
But oh...

140
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,000
I cut in and out.

141
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:04,960
Whoa.

142
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:05,740
Whoa.

143
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,320
It's...

144
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:13,280
It's not good.

145
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:14,340
.

146
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:14,820
.

147
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,740
So like...

148
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,700
I don't know what to do.

149
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:22,780
.

150
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:27,370
I think I'll go back.

151
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:28,550
So I don't know.

152
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:30,410
I don't know.

153
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:31,050
Now I'm back.

154
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:32,070
I'm back now.

155
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:33,250
.

156
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,390
That's why.

157
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:36,190
I'm a mess guys.

158
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:37,910
I'm a mess.

159
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:41,950
But at least I got my new PC before stream started.

160
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,430
So I win.

161
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:44,310
.

162
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:51,490
So in the end.

163
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:52,670
I win.

164
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:54,470
.

165
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:57,390
I'm sorry.

166
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:03,530
Ran into windows.

167
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:04,250
Okay.

168
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:05,250
To be fair.

169
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:07,430
I don't feel like a winner right now.

170
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:08,190
I don't.

171
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:08,910
.

172
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:11,490
To be fair chat.

173
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:13,790
I don't feel like a winner.

174
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:16,550
I feel like a mess at the moment.

175
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:17,390
.

176
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:25,990
Then we'll all have the same fate.

177
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:28,010
.

178
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:28,990
.

179
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:29,010
.

180
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:29,050
.

181
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:29,070
.

182
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:29,130
.

183
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:29,170
.

184
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:30,590
.

185
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:30,810
.

186
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:30,830
.

187
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:31,330
.

188
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:31,410
.

189
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:31,530
.

190
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:31,550
.

191
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:32,350
.

192
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:33,730
.

193
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:39,490
.

194
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:42,510
I'm on my new PC!

195
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:42,790
I'm on my new PC!

196
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:44,510
They give the Magenta Super!

197
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:45,290
Thank you!

198
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:52,610
Alright, so let me tell you the story of everything that happened today.

199
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:55,910
So like, um, it's been a long time.

200
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:57,030
By the way...

201
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:03,050
I did the file moving by an external hard drive.

202
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:08,750
I did not move... I did not move my drives.

203
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:12,730
Because I'm worried that my drivers were the issue as well.

204
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:19,110
So like, I was worried that like, I don't know, when my drivers is like, fucking...

205
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:21,570
Um, is like carrying the disease.

206
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:25,210
So like, I didn't want to move that into my new PC.

207
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:28,730
So I moved all like, the important files that I need.

208
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:31,350
Which was, okay to be fair, I also didn't...

209
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:33,030
There was so many important files.

210
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:34,090
So...

211
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:41,530
Sorry, I meant drives... guys, I'm a mess.

212
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:42,410
My brain's not working.

213
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:43,310
I meant drives.

214
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:46,430
So like, basically, I moved all my important files.

215
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:50,170
Which was like, I don't know, 600 gigabytes of stuff.

216
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:51,850
I don't know, 600 to 7...

217
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:53,490
Everything.

218
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:56,430
You know like, when you're highlighting and you're like, you highlight everything.

219
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:58,810
And you're like, everything is important.

220
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:00,750
Like, that's basically it.

221
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:02,810
So there's like, 600 gigabytes of files.

222
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:06,390
On my 1 terabyte external hard drive.

223
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:07,990
So...

224
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:09,710
So, yeah.

225
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:11,270
So I moved all of that.

226
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:12,530
And then I moved it to the new PC.

227
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:15,950
But the thing is, before I like, I was... I brought it out.

228
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:18,710
So like, you know how I always said like, guys, I cannot...

229
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:20,150
I cannot move it.

230
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:22,830
I'm worried I can't move it to my new PC.

231
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,550
Because I'm worried that it's not gonna fit.

232
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:26,910
Because the whole is triangular.

233
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:29,330
Well, it fits, so...

234
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:30,070
.

235
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:34,870
Guys, I couldn't believe it.

236
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:40,770
If the triangular PC fit in the square hole.

237
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:43,510
That's crazy, guys.

238
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:47,010
That was my main excuse.

239
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:55,890
That was my main excuse, guys.

240
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:58,110
And it actually fit.

241
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:00,030
Who would've thought?

242
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:02,230
Guys.

243
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:03,850
Okay, let me show you guys.

244
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:05,490
For those who don't follow me on Twitter.

245
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:06,870
So like...

246
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:10,110
This is basically...

247
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:11,530
Uh...

248
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:13,310
Alright, here.

249
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:15,670
Let me get the image out for you guys.

250
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:19,110
Oh my god, it's a big image too.

251
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:20,490
I need to resize it.

252
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:22,690
I need to resize it real quick.

253
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:23,870
Alright, so...

254
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:25,250
Here's the shape.

255
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:26,890
Here's the PC, guys.

256
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:27,970
So like...

257
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:30,250
I forgot that like...

258
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,690
On the side...

259
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:34,630
I could just slip it in on the side.

260
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:37,310
Instead of trying to force...

261
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:39,770
I forgot there's a giant hole on the side.

262
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,880
I was...

263
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:51,400
I was so focused on the two pillars in the front.

264
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:57,060
That I didn't realize that there was a hole on the side.

265
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:00,960
So...

266
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:04,060
So I could just slip it in.

267
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,720
So...

268
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:16,400
So I learned something new today.

269
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,540
Regarding shapes.

270
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,140
Chat.

271
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,060
Is that crazy?

272
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:24,060
Alright, anyway.

273
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,600
So...

274
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,840
I slipped it off the side.

275
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,540
And I...

276
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:31,020
In the The In the hole...

277
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:38,980
This was one of the main reasons it took so long because I was so worried about it not fitting into the hole.

278
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,620
The PC case hole.

279
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:42,460
Like the PC hole.

280
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:43,580
And...

281
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,180
And like.

282
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,720
So like that's why it's been delayed for so long.

283
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,660
So then when I finally took it out of the box.

284
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:56,580
I was like, wait...

285
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,720
It actually fits!

286
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:08,900
This is one of the biggest reasons why I never unpacked the PC.

287
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,340
It's because I was worried it wasn't going to fit.

288
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:17,560
So I was like, going to try to figure out how to put this PC into the hole.

289
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,300
But look guys, it fits!

290
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:20,640
I'm so happy!

291
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,520
Yay!

292
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,380
So yes.

293
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:29,440
After putting it into the hole...

294
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,940
Another issue came up.

295
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:35,580
Apparently...

296
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:38,220
As I plugged everything in...

297
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:41,480
I realized there was no graphics card in there.

298
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,700
Because the graphics card was shipped separately.

299
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:50,060
So we got it out of the hole.

300
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,580
And I am scared about...

301
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:54,240
Putting graphics cards...

302
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,640
Into a PC.

303
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,180
I'm really scared about that.

304
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,380
Because like...

305
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:02,840
This is a very expensive free PC.

306
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:04,520
And I was like...

307
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,280
I already got this far...

308
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,500
And I don't want to break anything.

309
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:09,820
So...

310
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:10,800
Because like...

311
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,000
At one point I almost broke the memory stick.

312
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:14,900
Well, yeah...

313
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,760
Putting memory sticks into...

314
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,520
RAM into the graphics cards.

315
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,980
The other boards and stuff is so scary.

316
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,720
Like, when I have to do it myself.

317
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:28,940
So then, like, after that I don't like putting parts into PCs anymore.

318
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:34,180
Because I almost... I almost broke one of the RAMs.

319
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,960
So... so, like, it...

320
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:45,160
So because of that, I don't... I don't put parts into PCs anymore.

321
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:49,760
Because I'm worried about breaking a very expensive PC part.

322
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:54,620
Bite size.

323
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:55,520
Thank you for the super chat.

324
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:55,880
Thank you.

325
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,500
Thank you.

326
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:57,400
Okie dokie.

327
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,780
I think I'm going to go back to basic geometry.

328
00:15:59,120 --> 00:15:59,660
How many sides?

329
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,860
It's almost... It's a triangle!

330
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,780
I don't know what other shape it could be.

331
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:05,420
Chat.

332
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:05,980
No.

333
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:07,880
It's definitely not a square.

334
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:12,680
It's definitely not a square.

335
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:13,440
Alright.

336
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:13,880
Anyway.

337
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:14,920
Anyway.

338
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:20,440
So, because of that, like, my... my... my dad...

339
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:24,200
My mom and dad took it to the store.

340
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,020
Like, one of the stores near us.

341
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,720
One of the PC repair stores.

342
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,520
And we're like, can you... And they're like, can you please put the...

343
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:34,040
Put the graphics card into the PC.

344
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:38,060
And then luckily it got done within, like, 30 minutes.

345
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:41,040
Dad brought it back home.

346
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:44,940
We put it back... We put the triangle back into the square hole.

347
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:49,440
And... And then, you know, we started booting everything up!

348
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,040
Yay!

349
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:53,300
It was working!

350
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:55,800
Things were, like, starting to work!

351
00:16:56,580 --> 00:17:02,620
And then I... And then, like, you know, I had to install all the updates and everything.

352
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:04,500
And...

353
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,060
Oh, yeah.

354
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:10,080
By the way, when we removed the old PC...

355
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:14,740
When we removed the old PC from the box... from the square hole...

356
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:16,620
There was so much dust underneath.

357
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:19,420
I like how people are like, how long have you, like, known?

358
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:20,420
How long have you not cleaned your PC?

359
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:24,160
I cleaned my PC, like, I think, like, November?

360
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,440
Yeah, November.

361
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:27,880
That PC has... was cleaned in November.

362
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:31,680
I know it's, like, a long time since November, by the way.

363
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:32,880
But...

364
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,660
But it was clean!

365
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:41,420
Anyway... Anyway...

366
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,240
Anyway... Um...

367
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,340
There was so much dust underneath, though.

368
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:47,860
It was crazy.

369
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,120
There was, like, a clump of dust.

370
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:56,640
So my dad started vacuuming... vacuuming it all up before we put the triangle back into the square hole.

371
00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:00,620
I realized there was, like, no music playing during my agony.

372
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:05,980
Anyway, let's have some happy music playing in there just to feel a little bit better about myself.

373
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,320
Anyway...

374
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,080
Um...

375
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:14,380
After...

376
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:15,200
Wait, let me...

377
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,360
I guess you can still...

378
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,580
Let me put a tiny version of this here.

379
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,140
Alright, so you guys can still look at chat.

380
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:20,720
Anyway!

381
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,000
So, after all of that...

382
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:24,260
Um...

383
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:24,920
Um...

384
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,280
As I was about to...

385
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:29,880
I was plugging in the... all the slots and everything.

386
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:31,340
Um...

387
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:34,180
I was plugging in all the slots and everything.

388
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,200
And then I realized...

389
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,680
Why is there only two slots for...

390
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,680
Why is there only two slots for monitors?

391
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,620
That can't be!

392
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,300
Like, even my old PC...

393
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:45,160
My old PC had, like, four slots for monitors.

394
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,400
So then I was, like, freaking out.

395
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,400
I was like, why is there only two slots?

396
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:52,500
Like, I was like, there's literally a 40-something in there.

397
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,600
I don't know which one it is.

398
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:54,580
But there's literally...

399
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:58,220
I don't know my numbers.

400
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:00,660
But there's literally a 40x in there.

401
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:01,600
Like, why?

402
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:03,300
Why could...

403
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,720
Is there only two holes?

404
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,360
And the thing is...

405
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:06,880
It's so...

406
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,660
My desk is, like, up against the...

407
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,560
My desk is, like...

408
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,140
Up against the...

409
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:15,780
Almost close to the wall.

410
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,780
But it's not up against the wall, by the way.

411
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:18,740
It's more so, like...

412
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,720
There's two other pillars.

413
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:23,020
There's two pillars at the end.

414
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:25,260
So it's very hard to, like...

415
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,840
See inside...

416
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,840
Like, see deeper inside...

417
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,640
To be like, where the fuck are the holes?

418
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:33,440
Because there's, like, two more pillars at the end.

419
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:33,900
You know?

420
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,980
So there's two pillars at the end...

421
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:37,220
And two pillars at the front.

422
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:39,280
So it's very hard to see...

423
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,040
Deeper to see where the graphics card is.

424
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,200
The holes for monitors.

425
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:44,880
So I had to take it out again!

426
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,440
And I realized...

427
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:46,640
You know?

428
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,200
I didn't realize this was the thing.

429
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:50,260
But there's plugs on a PC!

430
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:51,740
I was like, damn!

431
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,480
They plugged it!

432
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:53,520
Sorry.

433
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:58,060
But, like...

434
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,580
If you guys didn't know...

435
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:00,140
Like...

436
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,520
Newer PC...

437
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,100
Graphics...

438
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,860
Like, newer graphics cards...

439
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:05,660
Have, like, these little, like...

440
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:06,500
Dust plugs.

441
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,440
You know?

442
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,820
Like, you know what I'm talking about?

443
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:09,260
Like, they're like...

444
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:10,820
The dust plugs...

445
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,580
Where they cover up some of the holes.

446
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:13,900
But they don't...

447
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:14,560
So then, like...

448
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,220
There was like six of them.

449
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,500
So I had to, like...

450
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,720
Unplug, like...

451
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,460
Two of them.

452
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,240
And...

453
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,580
Don't laugh at that!

454
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:25,160
I mean, it sounds fucking weird!

455
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,280
MicroChat...

456
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,140
Thank you for the super chat.

457
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:29,800
Thank you.

458
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:30,260
Thank you.

459
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:32,280
Prove to us that your old PC is clean.

460
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,960
I mean, it's clean now!

461
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,960
Thank you for the super chat.

462
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:36,380
Thank you.

463
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:37,040
Thank you.

464
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:37,220
Thank you.

465
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,020
Thank you.

466
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:39,600
Thank you!

467
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:40,460
Thank you for the 20 gift championships!

468
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:40,960
Thank you!

469
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:41,600
Thank you!

470
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:42,740
Anyway...

471
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:43,460
So, like...

472
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,520
I had to, you know...

473
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,820
I was, like, freaking out a little bit.

474
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,360
Be like, why is there only two holes?

475
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:48,140
Like...

476
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:50,080
God gave this GPU...

477
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,780
Thank God should have given this GPU more than two holes.

478
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:53,240
I...

479
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:54,140
Anyway...

480
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:55,480
I should stop.

481
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,240
Um...

482
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:00,400
So I had to take it out of the square hole...

483
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,280
And, like...

484
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:02,280
Unplug...

485
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,740
Please don't be lewd.

486
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,360
I'm just talking about the rubber plugs!

487
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:07,020
Don't you get it?

488
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,640
Help keep dust away!

489
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:11,140
What do you want me to say?

490
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,280
Like...

491
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:22,440
Like, how else do I... sorry, my English is becoming ESL even though English is my first language.

492
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,940
I went through a lot today.

493
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:26,100
But like, what do I say?

494
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:27,860
It's a dust plug!

495
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,440
Like, oh sorry, a dust cover?

496
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,860
Like, it's clogging up the hole!

497
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,540
There's no other words for it!

498
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:43,160
Anyway, as I was saying...

499
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:51,660
I, you know, I took out the dust... sorry, I removed the dust coverings of the hole.

500
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:52,940
Is that better?

501
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:56,460
Do you want this app to make changes to your... okay.

502
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,020
I don't know what's...

503
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:01,820
I had something pop up and I said yes to it.

504
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,840
I don't know.

505
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:03,580
I don't know what it was.

506
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:08,740
Anyway!

507
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:09,880
Anyway!

508
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:11,400
After...

509
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,520
Oh, what the fuck?

510
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,920
Oh my god.

511
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:18,540
No, my Discord notifications are going off too.

512
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:19,340
Okay.

513
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:20,760
After...

514
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:29,980
After, like, we did the whole... removing the dust coverings...

515
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:32,260
You know, I started plugging back in the...

516
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:35,080
I started plugging in back the...

517
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:37,380
Uh... monitors and everything.

518
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,220
Plugging all the USBs and all that stuff.

519
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,080
And then booting the PC on.

520
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:44,680
And then everything... all the features downloading and everything.

521
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,880
And then I was greeted by Windows 11.

522
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:53,280
I...

523
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:57,140
I was greeted... with Windows 11.

524
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:00,440
I've never, ever...

525
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:06,740
I've never... ever... used Windows 11 before.

526
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:10,520
So as a Windows 10 user...

527
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:13,860
For... X amount of years...

528
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:17,640
Being welcomed by Windows 11...

529
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:20,620
And seeing the fucking Windows key...

530
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:22,740
In the center...

531
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,320
was not it.

532
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:31,340
I was like...

533
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:33,080
I hate change.

534
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:36,220
Why is my Windows key...

535
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,300
In the center?

536
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:45,380
What is this freak of nature doing there?

537
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,200
Um...

538
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,020
And then, you know how like Windows 11 is like super minimalistic?

539
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,320
But I just...

540
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:52,880
Oh my gosh.

541
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:53,600
I just...

542
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,480
I can't...

543
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,000
It's so hard to deal with change sometimes.

544
00:23:57,540 --> 00:24:00,000
Because I'm so used to seeing the same...

545
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,180
The same look...

546
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:02,960
For like...

547
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,820
Battle Explorers and everything.

548
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,740
So then I see like...

549
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:09,240
I just see like a square...

550
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,480
With like nothing.

551
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:13,220
With like nothing on it.

552
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,960
And I'm just like...

553
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,100
What the fuck is that?

554
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,100
Where are my bars?

555
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:20,120
Like...

556
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,180
Where are the...

557
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:22,840
Where are the bars?

558
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,340
To anything!

559
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,660
Why is it just a square?

560
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:29,580
Graphic design is my passion!

561
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:31,900
Like where is the stuff?

562
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,040
Anyway...

563
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:36,520
It was not a nice sight to see.

564
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,840
I was not...

565
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,680
Like I already went through a lot of change right now.

566
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,580
And then I have to see new...

567
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:45,700
More changes with Windows 11's interface.

568
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,400
Um...

569
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:49,300
So...

570
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:49,660
Um...

571
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:50,820
After that...

572
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:51,760
After you know...

573
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,900
Like being sad about Windows 11...

574
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,360
Where...

575
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,440
Where is my...

576
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,120
Exactly...

577
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,760
Where is my organized mess?

578
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,840
Where is my trash can?

579
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:06,480
I don't know what the fuck happened to my fucking trash can.

580
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,140
That was...

581
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:08,060
I was so sad.

582
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:08,880
I...

583
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,680
I was so sad.

584
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:11,300
I was like...

585
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,820
Where the hell is the trash can?

586
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:14,800
Um...

587
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,020
Yes.

588
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,560
After all of that...

589
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,020
I had to go through the whole...

590
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:19,900
The sound system and everything.

591
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,680
But the one thing...

592
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,340
That fucked me up...

593
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:24,180
During all...

594
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:25,060
Before this...

595
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:29,040
Was that my Windows for some reason could not activate.

596
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,060
Like...

597
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:30,700
Hahaha...

598
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,440
I...

599
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,380
I...

600
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:35,940
I...

601
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:36,720
Where have I...

602
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,240
I couldn't activate my Windows.

603
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:42,560
I don't know what's going on.

604
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:43,900
So...

605
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,920
So I like messaged...

606
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:46,720
Hi, it...

607
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,680
It was like...

608
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,520
Hey, is this supposed to happen?

609
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,700
Am I supposed to...

610
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,140
Have like...

611
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:53,820
Like...

612
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:56,160
Am I supposed to not have...

613
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,760
Like pay my own Windows?

614
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:58,640
Hahaha...

615
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,360
I'm so confused.

616
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:01,820
I...

617
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:03,020
I was like...

618
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,760
I thought I have Windows.

619
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:08,140
Because I'm clearly in Windows 11.

620
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,500
But like...

621
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,540
You know how they're like...

622
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:11,340
Oh, if you don't...

623
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:11,940
And so I'm like...

624
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,080
How is it not...

625
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,300
How is it not activated?

626
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:17,560
Like...

627
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:20,200
I'm already in the system.

628
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,300
Like...

629
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,920
I don't understand.

630
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:25,600
Hahaha...

631
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,880
So...

632
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:27,440
Uh...

633
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,320
So I was like...

634
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,320
Hey...

635
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,440
Um...

636
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:31,800
What's going on?

637
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,840
And they're like...

638
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:34,960
That's weird.

639
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:36,340
Because it's supposed...

640
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:38,380
You're supposed to have it activated.

641
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:41,420
So they gave me like a new key.

642
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,380
And then they like...

643
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:44,760
They gave me a new key.

644
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,160
And I put it in.

645
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,640
And it gave me an error.

646
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:48,840
That was like...

647
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:49,420
Sorry.

648
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,700
Your hardware changed.

649
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,100
So like...

650
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,780
We do not accept this key.

651
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,680
Because it doesn't work with that key.

652
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:56,440
I'm like...

653
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,420
What does that mean?

654
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,220
What does that...

655
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:00,460
Hahaha...

656
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:01,140
Hahaha...

657
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:01,780
Hahaha...

658
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,020
I was just so confused.

659
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:05,640
I was like...

660
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,140
What does that mean?

661
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,920
What do you mean my hardware changed?

662
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:13,000
I just got the hardware.

663
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,340
Like...

664
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:15,440
I don't understand.

665
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:17,600
So...

666
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,520
Um...

667
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,260
So then...

668
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:21,340
So then I was like...

669
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,840
That key didn't work.

670
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:25,020
So then they gave me another key.

671
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,100
And...

672
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,420
And then I was like...

673
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:28,420
And they're like...

674
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:28,700
Okay.

675
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,460
You go to your PowerShell.

676
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:30,920
Whatever.

677
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:31,780
And then...

678
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,600
And then you put this number in.

679
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,860
And then I did it.

680
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,440
And it still didn't work.

681
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:37,820
So I was like...

682
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:38,640
I don't...

683
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,120
I don't know what's going on.

684
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:45,320
I was just like...

685
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,120
I don't know what's going on.

686
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,600
I just want to activate my windows.

687
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:53,900
I don't know.

688
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:55,340
Why...

689
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:58,080
Why can't the windows be activated?

690
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:01,780
I want to customize my windows.

691
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,260
Stop playing!

692
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:07,100
So, um...

693
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:10,540
So, like, I don't know.

694
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,560
They messaged me something new.

695
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:14,920
But then I was like, I'm just gonna stream.

696
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:17,120
I need like, therapy.

697
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,920
I mean, I shouldn't say therapy because that's fucked up.

698
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:25,520
I need my free therapy from my dragoons.

699
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,320
Like...

700
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:33,140
I need my... I need like, reassurance right now.

701
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:37,900
Like, I... You guys are like my emotional support animal right now.

702
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,540
Like, my emotional support pet.

703
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:43,700
I need like, some emotional support right now.

704
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,080
Dango, thank you for the super chat.

705
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:49,980
Thank you, thank you.

706
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:52,700
I literally had the Windows change problem the other day.

707
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,540
There's a command in the command prompt.

708
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,500
You uninstall it and it will...

709
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,920
And re-enter the key.

710
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:57,920
Thank you for the super chat.

711
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:58,900
Thank you, thank you.

712
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,040
Yeah, they want me to do something with like, command prompts.

713
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,260
So then I was just like, okay.

714
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,200
Okay, I'll do that after the stream.

715
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,560
I need like... I'm like...

716
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:10,880
I'm like mentally fucked up right now from all...

717
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,640
I couldn't say that.

718
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,420
But like, I'm... I'm...

719
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:16,320
Like, I'm at my limit.

720
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:23,280
This PC fucked me up.

721
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:29,860
I need my emotional support dragons right now.

722
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:34,900
Like, yeah.

723
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:37,920
I got mindbroken by my own PC.

724
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,260
Anyway.

725
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,420
Anyway.

726
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:43,380
So, we did...

727
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:45,620
Okay, I wrote a list of stuff that happened.

728
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,800
Just in case.

729
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:49,800
So...

730
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:51,020
So, yeah.

731
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:54,620
That's basically how it all went when it came...

732
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:56,280
Okay, so I have to install everything again.

733
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,280
Like, OBS.

734
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,220
Uh...

735
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:59,200
GoXLR.

736
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:00,020
Steam.

737
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:01,480
Um...

738
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:04,280
Almost like, everything back up again.

739
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,600
And inputting all my passwords and everything.

740
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,800
I don't even have majority of the scenes set up.

741
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:13,740
I just got the starting screen, ending screen...

742
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:15,340
And my chatting screen.

743
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:16,740
Um...

744
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:18,840
And that's like, everything I've set up so far.

745
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:19,380
Okay.

746
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:20,440
Uh...

747
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,800
Reaper, thank you for the super chat.

748
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:22,640
Thank you, thank you.

749
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,980
Emotional support bucks.

750
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:24,900
Thank you.

751
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,460
Uh, Vapton, thank you for the super chat.

752
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:29,300
Thank you, thank you.

753
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,680
Built a PC a week ago and had the same problem.

754
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:33,680
Woke up one day and it activated.

755
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:36,960
It's cause keys are connected to Microsoft accounts.

756
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:38,940
Thank you for the super chat.

757
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:40,300
Thank you, thank you, Vapton.

758
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:41,560
That's...

759
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,680
That's so fucking stupid.

760
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:45,540
Why?

761
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:47,600
What?

762
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:48,820
How...

763
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:49,460
How...

764
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:50,240
So, like...

765
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,380
Do I just have to wait?

766
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:53,060
Like...

767
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:54,820
Hyatt bought me two...

768
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:56,420
Two product keys.

769
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:57,100
Like...

770
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,880
Wait, so like...

771
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:06,380
I just have to wait until they accept it?

772
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:08,000
Oh my...

773
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,900
Okay, well, I got two free...

774
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:12,040
Guys, I got two free window keys.

775
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:12,980
Okay.

776
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:15,080
Don't tell Hyatt this...

777
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,040
But like...

778
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:16,680
I...

779
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,080
I don't know if they're watching...

780
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,000
But like...

781
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,120
I freaked out...

782
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:21,400
Cause I was like...

783
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,780
Stream's about to start...

784
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:24,240
And I don't know what to do...

785
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,320
And like...

786
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:25,600
I...

787
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,280
I was like...

788
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,620
Really worried...

789
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:28,380
That like...

790
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:29,740
Because at that point...

791
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:30,300
Like...

792
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:32,060
It was more so of like...

793
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:33,260
Um...

794
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:33,540
Um...

795
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:34,940
My GoXLR wasn't work...

796
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:35,240
Like I...

797
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,640
My mic wasn't working...

798
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,620
So then I thought it was something to do with Windows...

799
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:40,440
So like...

800
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,020
Don't tell Hyatt...

801
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:44,900
But I also sort of spent $200...

802
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:45,880
And also...

803
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,780
Bought my own key...

804
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:49,140
Like...

805
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:49,180
I...

806
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:57,910
I...

807
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:02,690
================================================ Vu That's what's utilizirding us here...

808
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:05,370
Now we're bonded for life...

809
00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:07,150
You know my deep dark secret.

810
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:08,930
.

811
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:11,950
Now...

812
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:16,030

813
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:27,890
You gonna have to keep that secret to your grave... 첿 thank you very much.

814
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:28,450
This was a super chat.

815
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:30,210
Thank you, thank you Key Fund.

816
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:32,210
Guys, it's okay.

817
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:34,710
It was 200 Canadian.

818
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:37,990
So that's like, you know, 100 American.

819
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:45,290
But yes, the key also did not work by the way.

820
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:48,290
So like, so like, I don't know.

821
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:50,190
Bill Gates is a little bit...

822
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:53,010
It's like now he's a little bit richer now.

823
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:54,150
So yay.

824
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:55,970
At least it goes to charity.

825
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:00,750
So...

826
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:10,790
So yes, I have four Windows 11 keys now chat.

827
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:12,030
Yay.

828
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:15,850
Oh, thank you for the super chat.

829
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:16,850
Thank you, thank you.

830
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:21,470
Darkblade, she be collecting all the keys like it's Kingdom Hearts.

831
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:23,070
Thank you for the super chat, Darkblade.

832
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:24,010
Thank you, thank you.

833
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:26,570
Ru, thank you for the super chat.

834
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:27,410
Thank you, thank you.

835
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:27,890
You figured it out.

836
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:31,330
You figured after using PC for so long, you become more tech savvy.

837
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:32,490
Guess that's not the case.

838
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:34,290
Here's some for the tech troubles.

839
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:35,210
Thank you for the super chat.

840
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:35,950
Thank you, thank you.

841
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:40,030
But I've been using the same PC for like five years.

842
00:33:40,410 --> 00:33:42,150
I've been coasting.

843
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:47,190
Guys, I've like used that PC until it literally died.

844
00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:54,550
Like, I've been coasting so hard.

845
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:57,150
It like had like terminal disease.

846
00:33:57,150 --> 00:33:59,970
And I didn't even try to like save it anymore.

847
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:06,330
I just let it keep going until like until it actually just died.

848
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:14,310
So, like what do you mean I should be more tech savvy?

849
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:16,250
I've been fucking coasting.

850
00:34:18,410 --> 00:34:23,730
The moment it's at a good stage, I just don't care anymore about tech stuff.

851
00:34:23,990 --> 00:34:25,970
Like I've reached my point.

852
00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:27,230
I've reached my limit.

853
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:29,930
Yeah, I don't need a...

854
00:34:29,930 --> 00:34:32,590
This is why I need a tech guy.

855
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:41,010
Anyway, so that was the story of...

856
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:44,510
That was the story of new PC.

857
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:49,190
And now that we're here, I think it's time that we...

858
00:34:49,970 --> 00:34:52,610
Oh, Panzer, thank you for the 50 gifted chips.

859
00:34:52,810 --> 00:34:53,830
Thank you, thank you.

860
00:34:54,450 --> 00:34:55,110
Thank you.

861
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:56,090
I really appreciate it.

862
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:57,330
Thank you, Panzer.

863
00:34:57,470 --> 00:35:03,950
Anyway, guys, now that we're here, I think it's time that we give it a real funeral.

864
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:06,970
Alright, let me...

865
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:09,250
Alright, here we go.

866
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:11,730
Alright.

867
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:13,570
Okay.

868
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:15,310
So...

869
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:19,970
PC-kun has been with us for so long.

870
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:23,830
He's been there for like...

871
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:25,190
Since 2019.

872
00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:27,590
And...

873
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:29,250
Oh my gosh.

874
00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:32,010
I don't know if I can keep this...

875
00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:33,250
Keep it together, guys.

876
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:39,890
And...

877
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:44,890
PC-kun has been here since 2019.

878
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:46,350
Oh shit, wait.

879
00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:47,310
Sorry, PC-kun.

880
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:48,730
You're dead anyway already.

881
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:49,490
So like...

882
00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:51,230
People gotta see when...

883
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:52,190
That they donated.

884
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:52,910
I'm sorry.

885
00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:54,210
Give me a sec, PC-kun.

886
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:54,510
I'm...

887
00:35:57,890 --> 00:35:58,810
Where are my alerts?

888
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:00,770
PC-kun, give me a sec.

889
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:03,550
I need to find my alerts so people can see that they donated.

890
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:04,690
Give me a sec.

891
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:05,290
You're already dead.

892
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:05,730
It's okay.

893
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:09,070
Alright, there we go.

894
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:10,650
Anyway, like I was saying...

895
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:15,070
PC-kun has been here for...

896
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:16,810
How many years?

897
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:19,050
20, 21, 22, 23...

898
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:19,570
Five years.

899
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:21,070
Sorry, I have to count for my fingers.

900
00:36:21,310 --> 00:36:21,890
This is...

901
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:22,170
I'm sorry.

902
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:23,410
This is a problem.

903
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:28,370
And you've been there since the very beginning.

904
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:31,910
Before like anything really started.

905
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:33,530
Before like, you know...

906
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:34,070
Since I...

907
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:35,110
Before I went...

908
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:36,070
Went like...

909
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:38,210
Went big in content creation.

910
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:39,930
And...

911
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:45,290
You know, we've had lots of issues with you, PC-kun.

912
00:36:45,610 --> 00:36:46,910
You know, with...

913
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:47,310
We...

914
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:51,490
You had a lot of surgeries over the years.

915
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:52,630
And...

916
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:55,050
You had so many operations.

917
00:36:55,570 --> 00:36:57,750
Some of these parts inside you...

918
00:36:57,750 --> 00:37:00,810
Used to be from the other PC before you.

919
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:03,070
The PC-kun senior.

920
00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:05,110
Uh, yes.

921
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:07,310
I think that was also an issue, guys.

922
00:37:07,370 --> 00:37:09,110
Regarding why PC-kun...

923
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:09,870
Like...

924
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:11,790
Fucked up in the way it did.

925
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:13,030
And just died like that.

926
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:15,130
Because it actually had some parts that...

927
00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:17,350
Went from like even before his time.

928
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:18,310
So...

929
00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:19,730
So...

930
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:21,370
We had some transplants.

931
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:23,490
From like his previous generation.

932
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:24,790
So...

933
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:27,290
That could have been also a huge problem.

934
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:28,650
Um...

935
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:30,710
So he was...

936
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:32,690
He was a mess going in from the beginning.

937
00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:34,270
Like I did not...

938
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:35,810
I did not like...

939
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:37,470
Give him like the pathway to success.

940
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:40,970
I was so fucking cheap.

941
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:43,590
I like Frankenstein parts together onto him.

942
00:37:43,830 --> 00:37:44,350
So...

943
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:44,870
But...

944
00:37:45,290 --> 00:37:46,850
Despite all of that...

945
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:51,470
You gave us five really good years, PC-kun.

946
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:52,890
For all of us.

947
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:54,650
From the Bark Knights...

948
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:56,150
To the Dragoons.

949
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:57,730
And like...

950
00:37:57,730 --> 00:37:58,890
I mean...

951
00:37:58,890 --> 00:37:59,910
PC...

952
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:00,870
He was a winner.

953
00:38:01,170 --> 00:38:03,270
He went through so many tournaments.

954
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:07,230
And he got us that Sajam Slam 2 win.

955
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:09,150
Despite, you know...

956
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:09,930
Uh...

957
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:12,870
Despite we were going like five frames per second.

958
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:14,690
We were a fucking winner.

959
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:15,970
Uh...

960
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:17,550
Five glorious years.

961
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:19,970
In that five years...

962
00:38:19,970 --> 00:38:21,330
During the three year mark...

963
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:22,190
We thought...

964
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:23,910
We thought you were gonna die.

965
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:29,050
In that five...

966
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:29,330
In...

967
00:38:29,330 --> 00:38:30,810
I don't know if you guys remembered.

968
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:32,010
But in...

969
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:33,110
Year three...

970
00:38:33,850 --> 00:38:36,170
Year three of his lifespan...

971
00:38:36,170 --> 00:38:40,330
We had such a scary surgery that we had to do.

972
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:43,410
Do you guys remember that chat?

973
00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:44,890
Where like...

974
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:48,910
He had to go through one of the scariest surgery at that time.

975
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:50,750
You guys remember that?

976
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:51,990
And...

977
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:53,810
And then you...

978
00:38:53,810 --> 00:38:55,450
We laid you to rest.

979
00:38:56,530 --> 00:38:57,250
Um...

980
00:38:57,250 --> 00:38:59,010
Because you had to recover.

981
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:02,510
From...

982
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:04,010
From that surgery.

983
00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:05,870
Do you guys...

984
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:06,770
Dragoons...

985
00:39:06,770 --> 00:39:08,010
Do you remember that?

986
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:14,530
Uh...

987
00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:17,850
We thought you wouldn't make it PC-kun.

988
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:19,610
We thought...

989
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:20,710
That's my bed!

990
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:22,330
What do you mean?

991
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:23,590
Is that a child bed?

992
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:23,610
I don't know.

993
00:39:23,610 --> 00:39:23,910
It's a child bed.

994
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:25,130
Anyway...

995
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:26,970
In year three...

996
00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:28,770
We thought we lost you.

997
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:30,230
And...

998
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:31,930
We took you to the...

999
00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:33,470
We took you to the shop.

1000
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:34,670
So...

1001
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:37,590
And for your most scariest surgery.

1002
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:39,430
And...

1003
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:40,930
We thought we lost you.

1004
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:43,110
Because you wouldn't run anything.

1005
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:45,850
You crashed all my Apex games.

1006
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:47,290
And like...

1007
00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:48,830
I couldn't boot up Fortnite.

1008
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:56,590
We were so scared.

1009
00:39:57,790 --> 00:39:58,350
But...

1010
00:39:58,350 --> 00:40:00,110
After some...

1011
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:02,250
After recovery from the...

1012
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:02,870
From the...

1013
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:04,030
From the surgery.

1014
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:05,670
And like...

1015
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:07,810
We put in new parts into you.

1016
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:09,890
We put in a 4080.

1017
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:10,850
We...

1018
00:40:10,850 --> 00:40:11,070
Oh wait.

1019
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:11,190
No.

1020
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:11,990
That's another surgery.

1021
00:40:12,090 --> 00:40:12,370
Sorry.

1022
00:40:12,450 --> 00:40:13,510
That's a surgery in the future.

1023
00:40:13,790 --> 00:40:14,770
What did we put in?

1024
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:16,750
We put a new motherboard in you.

1025
00:40:16,910 --> 00:40:18,650
We got rid of the motherboard.

1026
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:21,050
That came from PC-kun senior.

1027
00:40:21,490 --> 00:40:23,710
And we got you a new motherboard.

1028
00:40:24,350 --> 00:40:24,630
Because...

1029
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:26,350
Joki has money then.

1030
00:40:26,610 --> 00:40:27,810
And she does now too.

1031
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:30,150
But Joki was making so much money.

1032
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:31,850
And she can finally...

1033
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:33,130
Afford...

1034
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:34,870
Better parts for you.

1035
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:37,570
That you don't need to be Frankenstein anymore.

1036
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:40,350
And then you recovered.

1037
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:45,310
You got better.

1038
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:49,090
And we thought you were gonna make it PC-kun.

1039
00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:53,030
We were...

1040
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:55,870
We all cheered for you when you came back.

1041
00:40:56,330 --> 00:40:58,390
Israel thank you for the 10 gift ships.

1042
00:40:58,670 --> 00:40:58,990
Thank you.

1043
00:40:59,010 --> 00:40:59,590
Thank you.

1044
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:00,690
And...

1045
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:03,450
We thought you were gonna make it.

1046
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:05,530
But then...

1047
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:06,970
But then...

1048
00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:08,990
We didn't know what you had...

1049
00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:10,090
Was terminal.

1050
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:12,910
That no amount of surgeries...

1051
00:41:12,910 --> 00:41:14,550
Was gonna save you.

1052
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:16,690
But we were all a fool.

1053
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:19,090
All of us thought...

1054
00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:21,950
That if we kept giving you new parts...

1055
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:23,010
That we kept giving you new parts...

1056
00:41:23,010 --> 00:41:23,250
That we would just...

1057
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:24,690
Frankensteining you.

1058
00:41:24,890 --> 00:41:26,510
That you'll just get better.

1059
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:28,470
But...

1060
00:41:29,290 --> 00:41:30,050
Sadly...

1061
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:31,670
That was not the case.

1062
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:33,510
Because...

1063
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:35,010
In another 2 years...

1064
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:37,830
You started failing again.

1065
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:43,230
And...

1066
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:47,990
We couldn't even play Fortnite on you anymore.

1067
00:41:48,350 --> 00:41:50,530
We didn't know what to do.

1068
00:41:50,850 --> 00:41:52,990
So we took you back into the...

1069
00:41:52,990 --> 00:41:53,450
Hospital.

1070
00:41:53,870 --> 00:41:55,870
Back to the repair shop.

1071
00:41:58,770 --> 00:42:02,410
We took you back into the repair shop.

1072
00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:04,070
PC Koon.

1073
00:42:04,330 --> 00:42:06,390
We thought this time...

1074
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:07,450
Maybe...

1075
00:42:07,450 --> 00:42:09,990
Maybe the second surgery...

1076
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:11,950
The third or the third...

1077
00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:12,590
Also no sorry.

1078
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:13,590
The third surgery...

1079
00:42:13,590 --> 00:42:14,970
You went through so many surgeries.

1080
00:42:15,290 --> 00:42:16,450
I've lost track.

1081
00:42:16,770 --> 00:42:18,530
We put you in there...

1082
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:19,810
Back to back.

1083
00:42:20,050 --> 00:42:21,990
You were in the hospital...

1084
00:42:21,990 --> 00:42:23,710
For a week straight.

1085
00:42:24,970 --> 00:42:28,070
You had so many surgeries sent.

1086
00:42:28,410 --> 00:42:30,970
We even gave you a 4080.

1087
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:33,770
We thought you would pull through.

1088
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:37,390
Because when we took you back home after...

1089
00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:40,130
We could finally play Fortnite.

1090
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:46,770
And the finals.

1091
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:53,810
We were able...

1092
00:42:53,810 --> 00:42:56,530
To play Fortnite...

1093
00:42:56,530 --> 00:42:58,390
And the finals.

1094
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:00,030
But...

1095
00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:02,650
It was just temporary.

1096
00:43:03,830 --> 00:43:06,370
Because whatever you had...

1097
00:43:06,370 --> 00:43:08,270
It spread again.

1098
00:43:08,730 --> 00:43:14,210
It didn't matter how many new parts we gave you PC Koon.

1099
00:43:14,370 --> 00:43:17,810
It didn't matter that you had a 4080.

1100
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:21,050
Whatever that was inside you.

1101
00:43:21,050 --> 00:43:23,170
It kept coming back.

1102
00:43:27,890 --> 00:43:29,470
I was desperate.

1103
00:43:29,910 --> 00:43:31,990
I didn't want to let you go.

1104
00:43:32,390 --> 00:43:35,710
You've been here for five years PC Koon.

1105
00:43:35,970 --> 00:43:38,130
You were there since the beginning.

1106
00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:40,710
And you brought me all the way here.

1107
00:43:42,190 --> 00:43:44,610
We had to underclock it.

1108
00:43:44,770 --> 00:43:46,470
It was our last shot.

1109
00:43:46,670 --> 00:43:48,090
The doctors told me.

1110
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:50,910
This was the last thing we can do.

1111
00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:54,370
Because you kept crashing.

1112
00:43:54,450 --> 00:43:55,850
You crashed again.

1113
00:43:56,210 --> 00:43:58,050
It was just one crash.

1114
00:43:58,410 --> 00:44:00,650
I thought it was just a fluke.

1115
00:44:00,810 --> 00:44:01,990
But then...

1116
00:44:01,990 --> 00:44:04,170
You kept crashing even more.

1117
00:44:04,810 --> 00:44:06,650
And then I got worried.

1118
00:44:06,770 --> 00:44:08,110
I was like...

1119
00:44:08,110 --> 00:44:09,590
It's just game crashes.

1120
00:44:09,790 --> 00:44:12,010
I don't have to worry about that.

1121
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:14,190
But then...

1122
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:16,630
You started blue screening.

1123
00:44:17,370 --> 00:44:19,650
And that's when I knew...

1124
00:44:19,650 --> 00:44:20,890
It was going to be a long time.

1125
00:44:20,890 --> 00:44:22,750
It was only a matter of time.

1126
00:44:23,730 --> 00:44:24,530
And...

1127
00:44:24,530 --> 00:44:27,810
We didn't have that much left together.

1128
00:44:34,930 --> 00:44:36,530
I thought...

1129
00:44:36,530 --> 00:44:38,710
Maybe the first blue screen...

1130
00:44:38,710 --> 00:44:40,050
It was a fluke.

1131
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:41,670
You know PC Koon?

1132
00:44:41,950 --> 00:44:44,770
The very first blue screen we had...

1133
00:44:45,110 --> 00:44:46,410
It was a fluke.

1134
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:49,750
But then you blue screened when we were just...

1135
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:51,230
Playing off stream.

1136
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:53,730
Well technically like they were streaming.

1137
00:44:53,970 --> 00:44:55,550
And you blue screened...

1138
00:44:55,550 --> 00:44:56,340
Four times.

1139
00:44:57,330 --> 00:44:58,440
In two hours.

1140
00:45:00,410 --> 00:45:02,450
That's when I knew...

1141
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:05,970
I had to take you to the barn.

1142
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:08,050
I had to take you to behind the barn.

1143
00:45:10,810 --> 00:45:12,850
Back to the farm upstate.

1144
00:45:17,510 --> 00:45:18,130
You were...

1145
00:45:21,230 --> 00:45:21,970
You were there...

1146
00:45:22,810 --> 00:45:25,730
For a long time PC Koon.

1147
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:27,630
But...

1148
00:45:28,830 --> 00:45:29,470
Sadly...

1149
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:32,590
Everything has to come to an end.

1150
00:45:34,990 --> 00:45:37,570
And I got sent a new free PC.

1151
00:45:39,310 --> 00:45:42,550
That might be a bit better than you.

1152
00:45:43,230 --> 00:45:45,950
I'll never say that while you're still alive.

1153
00:45:46,870 --> 00:45:49,190
Because technically I have to use you later.

1154
00:45:49,270 --> 00:45:50,350
And like him tonight.

1155
00:45:50,490 --> 00:45:50,950
So...

1156
00:45:54,150 --> 00:45:54,830
So...

1157
00:45:54,830 --> 00:45:55,210
Do you care?

1158
00:45:56,470 --> 00:46:00,450
So you gotta live on just a little bit longer so...

1159
00:46:00,450 --> 00:46:01,430
Please!

1160
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:09,280
So you gotta live on just a little bit longer, ヽ ノso...

1161
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:09,580
They...

1162
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:12,460
I'm sorry PC Koon.

1163
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:13,400
I can't help.

1164
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:14,520
This new PC...

1165
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:17,060
Also has a 4080.

1166
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:21,220
And all the parts... All the parts!

1167
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,800
I don't know what's wrong with you.

1168
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:39,820
There is no cure.

1169
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:41,440
There is no cure.

1170
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:44,960
The doctors...

1171
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:48,860
They said you had one year left to live.

1172
00:46:48,860 --> 00:46:54,500
But I extended your lifespan to five years, PC-kun.

1173
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:59,260
But it's time.

1174
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:02,300
You just...

1175
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:07,760
You lived so long and saw so many victories, so many achievements.

1176
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:12,080
But there was no cure to keep you on longer.

1177
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:16,160
I can't keep frankensteining you anymore, PC-kun.

1178
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:18,360
I don't know what is wrong.

1179
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:26,880
I don't know what is wrong, PC-kun.

1180
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:31,240
It's just not curable.

1181
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:33,520
The doctors don't even know.

1182
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:36,360
So we have to put you down.

1183
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:40,100
Thank you for all the years you've given us.

1184
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:44,480
I'll just say, PC-kun.

1185
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:50,860
Just don't think of it, PC-kun.

1186
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:51,320
Of me.

1187
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:51,640
Like, I don't know what is wrong.

1188
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:53,560
Like, replacing you with a younger, hotter model.

1189
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:56,560
Like, it's not by choice, okay?

1190
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:58,740
I just need you to know this, PC-kun.

1191
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:04,860
It's not by choice that the newer PC happens to be younger and hotter and more expensive than you.

1192
00:48:05,540 --> 00:48:06,320
It's just...

1193
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:07,780
It was just handed to me.

1194
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:10,680
Like, why would I say no to free stuff?

1195
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:18,820
Just know it wasn't by choice.

1196
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:23,920
Anyway.

1197
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:25,600
Anyway.

1198
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:30,320
Thank you for everything you've done.

1199
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:36,420
Do the dragoons have any final words to say to PC-kun, guys?

1200
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:41,020
Do the dragoons have any final words to give us?

1201
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:47,320
Don't worry, guys.

1202
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:50,940
Do you guys have any final words?

1203
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:51,620
Final words.

1204
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:51,800
Hahaha!

1205
00:48:59,180 --> 00:49:00,520
07, guys.

1206
00:49:01,430 --> 00:49:03,720
Get NT, alright?!

1207
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:06,180
It wasn't by choice, guys!

1208
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:07,600
I told you!

1209
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:09,720
It wasn't by choice!

1210
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:13,180
It was just free!

1211
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:19,160
It's been a long ride, PC-kun.

1212
00:49:23,250 --> 00:49:29,510
Now, before we give a moment of silence...

1213
00:49:34,430 --> 00:49:41,790
Before we give a moment of silence to PC-kun...

1214
00:49:41,790 --> 00:49:47,030
I just would like to say...

1215
00:49:47,030 --> 00:49:56,240
I would like to say something very important for them.

1216
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:56,740
For them.

1217
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:00,660
It is that...

1218
00:50:02,540 --> 00:50:04,240
We have a word from our sponsors.

1219
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:06,140
So...

1220
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:13,600
Anyway, I don't know if you guys know this, but my YouTube speaker is out now.

1221
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:15,680
And it's actually crazy.

1222
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:19,020
And... oh wait, sorry, let me turn off...

1223
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:19,980
Let me...

1224
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:21,140
Sorry, give me a sec.

1225
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:23,380
Let me change the song real quick.

1226
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:29,360
Alright.

1227
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:33,120
Alright, anyway, before we...

1228
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:35,700
Yeah, I need to have like a more upbeat song, by the way.

1229
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:36,200
Give me a sec.

1230
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:37,660
Alright, this is good.

1231
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:39,520
Alright.

1232
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,120
Oh my god, guys.

1233
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:41,900
So...

1234
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:44,160
Today, if you guys didn't know...

1235
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:49,480
Today, the YouTube speaker just came out for pre-order.

1236
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:52,280
And it's only for like four weeks, by the way.

1237
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:54,240
So like after the four weeks is over...

1238
00:50:55,580 --> 00:50:57,440
Look, this funeral is not cheap.

1239
00:50:57,640 --> 00:50:58,740
After the...

1240
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:03,320
After the four weeks is over, the figure is gone.

1241
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:06,080
So make sure to pre-order now.

1242
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:08,560
Before it's gone forever.

1243
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,560
This is actually like my very...

1244
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:13,640
This funeral is sponsored by YouTube.

1245
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:18,580
So it's a...

1246
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:23,800
This is my very first official Doki figure.

1247
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:27,200
And I actually have like the prototype with me right now.

1248
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:29,220
And it's really cool.

1249
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:30,320
They sent it to me for free.

1250
00:51:30,540 --> 00:51:31,600
And everything.

1251
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:32,940
So yeah, make sure...

1252
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:34,420
It's so insane.

1253
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:38,880
Like I checked it and like 500 of you guys already pre-ordered.

1254
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:41,400
After it launched like four hours ago.

1255
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:42,640
So like thank you guys.

1256
00:51:42,740 --> 00:51:44,680
Thank you, Dragos, for pre-ordering it.

1257
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:48,940
And yeah, check it out.

1258
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:52,560
I'm so happy that we have our first official figure.

1259
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:53,780
Maybe more...

1260
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:55,340
Many more to come in the future.

1261
00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:55,860
Let's hope.

1262
00:51:55,900 --> 00:51:56,540
Cross our fingers.

1263
00:51:57,340 --> 00:51:58,540
And hope that...

1264
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:02,660
That we can get more amazing stuff in the future.

1265
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:03,920
But yeah, huge shout out.

1266
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:05,280
Huge shout out to...

1267
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:06,080
To YouTube.

1268
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:07,140
Wait, mod.

1269
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:08,660
Where is the ad that you posted?

1270
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:11,080
Can you repost the link and I'll pin it real quick?

1271
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:12,880
Alright, let me pin this real quick.

1272
00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:13,580
Alright.

1273
00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:14,420
Alright, guys.

1274
00:52:14,620 --> 00:52:15,280
Alright, there you go.

1275
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:16,140
I think that's good.

1276
00:52:20,820 --> 00:52:21,620
Alright, nice.

1277
00:52:22,060 --> 00:52:22,460
Alright.

1278
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:23,200
Okay, anyway.

1279
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:24,500
Back to the...

1280
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:26,160
Back to the funeral.

1281
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:34,660
PC Koon would have wanted this!

1282
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:35,160
Chat!

1283
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:38,520
PC Koon would have wanted it!

1284
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:43,180
I've been happy that I'm like making it right now.

1285
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:48,040
Now...

1286
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:50,680
Before we lower the casket...

1287
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:51,660
For...

1288
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:53,940
For PC Koon...

1289
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:55,380
Let us...

1290
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:57,620
Let us have a minute of silence...

1291
00:52:58,360 --> 00:52:59,340
For everybody.

1292
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:02,140
Let's have a minute of silence for PC Koon and everybody.

1293
00:54:05,370 --> 00:54:05,930
Yes.

1294
00:54:12,990 --> 00:54:13,550
Well...

1295
00:54:14,390 --> 00:54:15,150
It's okay.

1296
00:54:15,310 --> 00:54:17,150
Now I have a hotter, newer version.

1297
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:30,180
Hey!

1298
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:31,240
Hey!

1299
00:54:35,540 --> 00:54:40,100
Guys, I guess you guys never expected to...

1300
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:43,780
expected a PC funeral, but here we are.

1301
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:50,940
Don't disrespect him like that.

1302
00:54:54,510 --> 00:54:57,010
Oh my god, what a...

1303
00:54:57,010 --> 00:54:59,270
what a day, guys.

1304
00:54:59,610 --> 00:55:00,250
What a...

1305
00:55:00,250 --> 00:55:01,870
what a fucking day.

1306
00:55:05,590 --> 00:55:08,130
Oh yeah, we have PC will reading.

1307
00:55:08,330 --> 00:55:09,910
That PC had nothing.

1308
00:55:10,250 --> 00:55:11,750
I provided everything.

1309
00:55:12,630 --> 00:55:14,310
Darkblade, thank you for the super chat.

1310
00:55:14,390 --> 00:55:14,750
Thank you.

1311
00:55:14,790 --> 00:55:15,470
Thank you.

1312
00:55:16,670 --> 00:55:17,670
Oh my god.

1313
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:20,250
Yeah, that was basically...

1314
00:55:21,210 --> 00:55:22,210
my day.

1315
00:55:22,690 --> 00:55:23,550
My entire day.

1316
00:55:23,870 --> 00:55:26,410
I still have not downloaded...

1317
00:55:26,410 --> 00:55:28,870
I still haven't downloaded...

1318
00:55:28,870 --> 00:55:30,330
like everything yet.

1319
00:55:30,450 --> 00:55:32,990
And like I said, I need to fix my mic settings.

1320
00:55:33,310 --> 00:55:33,710
Like...

1321
00:55:35,330 --> 00:55:37,250
I know I sound different.

1322
00:55:37,410 --> 00:55:39,050
I'm sorry if I sound...

1323
00:55:39,050 --> 00:55:40,490
I'm sorry if I sound...

1324
00:55:40,490 --> 00:55:41,710
really different, guys.

1325
00:55:46,570 --> 00:55:48,450
But I hope...

1326
00:55:48,450 --> 00:55:51,010
I hope that like...

1327
00:55:51,010 --> 00:55:52,670
I can fix...

1328
00:55:52,690 --> 00:55:54,650
put it into my regular settings.

1329
00:55:54,930 --> 00:55:56,550
But tonight...

1330
00:55:56,550 --> 00:55:58,570
and I'm gonna take it...

1331
00:55:58,570 --> 00:56:00,630
I'm obviously gonna take it to the shop.

1332
00:56:00,850 --> 00:56:02,410
To like add another driver.

1333
00:56:02,870 --> 00:56:04,770
Uh... add another driver...

1334
00:56:04,770 --> 00:56:05,450
to this PC.

1335
00:56:05,690 --> 00:56:06,730
To my hotter...

1336
00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:08,350
newer trophy PC.

1337
00:56:08,830 --> 00:56:10,490
Uh... who's also younger.

1338
00:56:15,390 --> 00:56:16,750
Who's also...

1339
00:56:16,750 --> 00:56:18,050
younger...

1340
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:20,210
from a good family too.

1341
00:56:25,290 --> 00:56:25,690
Um...

1342
00:56:27,030 --> 00:56:27,430
Sorry.

1343
00:56:27,510 --> 00:56:28,370
Install a new...

1344
00:56:28,370 --> 00:56:29,350
Get a new drive.

1345
00:56:30,030 --> 00:56:32,470
Get a new drive installed in there.

1346
00:56:32,510 --> 00:56:33,790
Get another SSD in there.

1347
00:56:33,850 --> 00:56:35,830
Because I don't like that it has only one SSD.

1348
00:56:36,310 --> 00:56:38,550
I feel like I'm gonna be using a lot of space.

1349
00:56:38,830 --> 00:56:39,230
So...

1350
00:56:39,230 --> 00:56:40,490
I'm gonna...

1351
00:56:42,370 --> 00:56:42,770
Uh...

1352
00:56:45,310 --> 00:56:45,710
Um...

1353
00:56:45,710 --> 00:56:47,670
Get another SSD added in there.

1354
00:56:47,750 --> 00:56:48,490
Just to fix it.

1355
00:56:49,110 --> 00:56:49,630
Uh...

1356
00:56:49,630 --> 00:56:51,390
Dude that's so... It's a PC!

1357
00:56:51,710 --> 00:56:53,270
Like what do you mean?

1358
00:56:54,470 --> 00:56:57,030
What the fuck do you mean?

1359
00:56:57,390 --> 00:56:59,030
It's literally a PC.

1360
00:56:59,350 --> 00:57:01,250
I'm just describing a PC.

1361
00:57:02,490 --> 00:57:03,010
Guys...

1362
00:57:06,830 --> 00:57:07,350
Uh...

1363
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:09,590
And like...

1364
00:57:09,590 --> 00:57:12,130
I'm trying to think of what else I need to do.

1365
00:57:12,270 --> 00:57:14,330
I think... I know like I have to...

1366
00:57:14,330 --> 00:57:15,210
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah.

1367
00:57:15,350 --> 00:57:16,390
I need to make sure I like...

1368
00:57:16,390 --> 00:57:17,210
save everything.

1369
00:57:17,470 --> 00:57:17,750
Like...

1370
00:57:18,490 --> 00:57:20,490
Uh... have all my correct settings and everything...

1371
00:57:20,490 --> 00:57:21,230
to establish.

1372
00:57:21,450 --> 00:57:21,670
But yeah.

1373
00:57:21,870 --> 00:57:24,310
Definitely gonna unplug this one...

1374
00:57:25,310 --> 00:57:25,830
tomorrow.

1375
00:57:26,150 --> 00:57:27,270
And take it to the shop.

1376
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:30,390
Before my stream tomorrow.

1377
00:57:30,570 --> 00:57:30,990
The train.

1378
00:57:31,470 --> 00:57:33,950
Because like really I just need to install the SSD and everything.

1379
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:36,750
So like... I'll plug back in.

1380
00:57:36,950 --> 00:57:38,370
I'll dig the grave out.

1381
00:57:38,650 --> 00:57:40,610
And then just plug it in and like...

1382
00:57:40,610 --> 00:57:42,330
I'll go like grave robbing...

1383
00:57:42,330 --> 00:57:43,010
later tonight.

1384
00:57:43,250 --> 00:57:44,130
Or tomorrow morning.

1385
00:57:44,450 --> 00:57:46,810
Actually do I grave rob tomorrow morning?

1386
00:57:46,830 --> 00:57:47,590
Or later tonight?

1387
00:57:47,850 --> 00:57:48,390
Maybe tomorrow?

1388
00:57:48,490 --> 00:57:48,970
Tomorrow morning.

1389
00:57:48,990 --> 00:57:50,550
So I'll go grave rob...

1390
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:51,270
tomorrow morning.

1391
00:57:51,550 --> 00:57:52,330
And like...

1392
00:57:52,330 --> 00:57:54,370
dig through the carcass for...

1393
00:57:54,370 --> 00:57:56,130
uh... my mic settings.

1394
00:57:56,450 --> 00:57:56,730
The...

1395
00:58:00,930 --> 00:58:02,810
For the mic settings.

1396
00:58:02,850 --> 00:58:04,390
And then like you know...

1397
00:58:04,390 --> 00:58:05,690
put it back into the grave.

1398
00:58:05,990 --> 00:58:08,550
So I can put the mic... and then take my...

1399
00:58:08,550 --> 00:58:10,750
my new gal to the shop.

1400
00:58:10,930 --> 00:58:11,710
So I can...

1401
00:58:12,390 --> 00:58:14,230
My new gal wants a Gucci bag.

1402
00:58:14,430 --> 00:58:16,110
And I'm gonna get her that Gucci bag.

1403
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:22,070
My new PC...

1404
00:58:22,070 --> 00:58:24,550
My younger...

1405
00:58:24,550 --> 00:58:26,310
more expensive...

1406
00:58:26,310 --> 00:58:27,370
She's a classy lady.

1407
00:58:27,630 --> 00:58:27,790
Okay?

1408
00:58:27,850 --> 00:58:29,510
I need to get her that Louis Vuitton bag.

1409
00:58:29,930 --> 00:58:31,570
And by Louis Vuitton bag...

1410
00:58:31,570 --> 00:58:33,390
I need to get her that SSD drive...

1411
00:58:33,390 --> 00:58:34,470
into her system.

1412
00:58:41,030 --> 00:58:41,550
And...

1413
00:58:42,110 --> 00:58:42,470
And...

1414
00:58:42,470 --> 00:58:43,850
Get her... uh...

1415
00:58:43,850 --> 00:58:45,370
Get her all dolled up.

1416
00:58:45,670 --> 00:58:46,230
And...

1417
00:58:50,590 --> 00:58:51,570
I'm sorry...

1418
00:58:51,570 --> 00:58:54,130
I'm sorry...

1419
00:58:54,130 --> 00:58:55,310
I'm sorry...

1420
00:58:55,310 --> 00:58:58,210
I'm sorry I took that joke way too far.

1421
00:58:58,430 --> 00:58:59,530
I took that too far.

1422
00:59:03,090 --> 00:59:03,650
Um...

1423
00:59:04,290 --> 00:59:05,310
Uh... But yeah.

1424
00:59:05,610 --> 00:59:07,110
It's been a lot.

1425
00:59:07,370 --> 00:59:08,610
I think I only slept...

1426
00:59:08,610 --> 00:59:10,450
4 hours today.

1427
00:59:10,650 --> 00:59:12,270
Because I've just been like...

1428
00:59:12,470 --> 00:59:13,990
doing PC setup stuff.

1429
00:59:14,730 --> 00:59:16,570
I can't bel... I still can't...

1430
00:59:16,570 --> 00:59:18,710
believe it fit in the hole.

1431
00:59:19,670 --> 00:59:20,150
Like...

1432
00:59:20,150 --> 00:59:22,290
The triangle fit in the square hole.

1433
00:59:22,710 --> 00:59:24,450
Because that was literally my biggest...

1434
00:59:24,450 --> 00:59:24,850
problem.

1435
00:59:25,190 --> 00:59:26,430
And that's why it took...

1436
00:59:26,430 --> 00:59:26,930
so long.

1437
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:28,110
Like I was...

1438
00:59:28,110 --> 00:59:29,470
stalling for so long.

1439
00:59:29,870 --> 00:59:31,870
Because I was trying to figure out what to do.

1440
00:59:32,030 --> 00:59:34,370
Because I was like... Okay maybe I'll just wait until I move.

1441
00:59:34,630 --> 00:59:34,970
You know?

1442
00:59:35,050 --> 00:59:36,170
Maybe I'll just wait until I move.

1443
00:59:36,310 --> 00:59:37,630
And then like buy a new desk.

1444
00:59:37,910 --> 00:59:39,270
That can fit this PC.

1445
00:59:39,650 --> 00:59:42,290
And then all it... And then it was only because...

1446
00:59:42,470 --> 00:59:44,310
like I forgot there's a side opening.

1447
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:49,810
HAHAHAHAHA I forgot you can like...

1448
00:59:49,810 --> 00:59:51,970
put the PC in the side.

1449
00:59:52,550 --> 00:59:54,070
Like I kept thinking...

1450
00:59:54,070 --> 00:59:56,030
like I have to like slip it into the...

1451
00:59:56,030 --> 00:59:57,170
the pillars.

1452
00:59:57,650 --> 00:59:59,950
But I was like I can't slip it into the pillars.

1453
01:00:00,070 --> 01:00:00,730
It's a triangle.

1454
01:00:01,090 --> 01:00:02,250
This hole is a square.

1455
01:00:02,730 --> 01:00:05,530
Then I forgot there's literally a giant hole in the side.

1456
01:00:06,270 --> 01:00:07,890
That I could slide it in.

1457
01:00:09,750 --> 01:00:11,270
And this PC...

1458
01:00:11,270 --> 01:00:13,190
I spent in a box for a month.

1459
01:00:13,470 --> 01:00:15,910
And then just out there for another month.

1460
01:00:16,050 --> 01:00:17,930
Because I literally couldn't do shapes.

1461
01:00:18,170 --> 01:00:18,830
Because I literally couldn't do shapes.

1462
01:00:18,830 --> 01:00:20,070
Like I couldn't...

1463
01:00:20,070 --> 01:00:22,790
I literally couldn't like figure out shapes.

1464
01:00:23,050 --> 01:00:24,470
And like spatial awareness.

1465
01:00:24,870 --> 01:00:26,870
That like it was going to fit.

1466
01:00:27,250 --> 01:00:29,050
It was only because I...

1467
01:00:29,050 --> 01:00:30,430
My other PC...

1468
01:00:30,430 --> 01:00:33,010
My PC-kun was literally...

1469
01:00:33,010 --> 01:00:33,850
dead.

1470
01:00:34,050 --> 01:00:36,630
Like the carcass was just there in the open.

1471
01:00:37,410 --> 01:00:39,830
That I had to try something.

1472
01:00:39,970 --> 01:00:41,030
That I had to try something.

1473
01:00:43,310 --> 01:00:44,950
Look I'm 2D.

1474
01:00:45,090 --> 01:00:46,810
I can't think in 3D.

1475
01:00:47,450 --> 01:00:48,090
Chat.

1476
01:00:48,370 --> 01:00:49,750
This is the issue.

1477
01:00:49,850 --> 01:00:51,230
I can't think in 3D.

1478
01:00:51,250 --> 01:00:52,110
If I'm 2D.

1479
01:00:52,310 --> 01:00:54,330
You can't blame that on me.

1480
01:00:57,830 --> 01:01:00,590
You can't blame that on me.

1481
01:01:00,910 --> 01:01:03,250
I don't think in three dimensionals.

1482
01:01:05,990 --> 01:01:07,430
What a fucking...

1483
01:01:07,430 --> 01:01:08,230
wild ride.

1484
01:01:10,410 --> 01:01:11,050
Well...

1485
01:01:11,270 --> 01:01:12,670
I think that's really it.

1486
01:01:12,810 --> 01:01:13,730
That's really it.

1487
01:01:14,250 --> 01:01:15,210
