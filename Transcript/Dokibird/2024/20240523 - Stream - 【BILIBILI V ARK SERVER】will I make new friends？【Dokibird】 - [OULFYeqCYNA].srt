1
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:50,910
Hello everybody!

2
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:53,130
Hello, hello, hello!

3
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:56,390
Okay, and welcome.

4
00:01:56,550 --> 00:02:00,670
This is gonna be my very first time playing ARC ever.

5
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:04,810
And like, honestly, I actually don't know how the ping is
gonna be like.

6
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:13,130
Because, you know, it's like, you might need to get
something to help you boost your ping to the server, maybe.

7
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:15,090
And I was like, oh, it'll be fine.

8
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:16,370
We'll figure this out live.

9
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:28,310
I'm sure I might have should have you know tested it out
tested out the server ping before you know before the stream

10
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:37,010
but like I don't know I just believed if I believe enough
it'll be okay as long as we keep believing it will be okay

11
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:50,290
yes yes welcome um I've never played arc before guys never
in my life The reason why we're playing our very late at

12
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:58,070
night is because this is the Billy Billy VTuber server that
Hero invited me to.

13
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:04,210
And, you know, a majority of the people will be playing, you
know, at their hours.

14
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:11,870
Because I was asking Hero, I was like, oh, like what time do
usually people get on?

15
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:15,970
And they're like, she was like, oh, like 4 a.m.

16
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:16,630
my time.

17
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:32,110
so I was like maybe not I'm just thinking I'm gonna this is
a compromise I was like you know maybe not 4 a.m.

18
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:39,550
I don't really want to I don't really want to play arc at 4
in the morning so 11 p.m.

19
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:47,510
would be the best bet thank you for the super chat thank you
thank you now placing bets on how she's going to pronounce

20
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:48,670
Waverne.

21
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:49,630
Waverne.

22
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:50,470
Thank you for the super chat.

23
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:50,750
Thank you.

24
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:51,350
Thank you.

25
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:54,810
But yes, I have zero knowledge of this game.

26
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:03,110
And they never played ARC before, so this is going to be
interesting.

27
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:11,310
I'm ready for all the backseaters to like yell at me because
I have no clue what the fuck to do in ARC.

28
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:28,470
I have idea what to do um and oh yeah also a little funny
update so like you know how like yesterday i was like you

29
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:35,470
know what let's just play every copy like let's just play
copyright songs yesterday well not cop okay not technically

30
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:45,490
yes like jazz like i mean it's still jazz it's not like
clicking uh it's not like disney composed a jazz song it was

31
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:53,470
like a cover song of jazz But anyway, I got, I'm sharing
revenue with Disney, Nintendo, and Ghibli.

32
00:04:54,950 --> 00:05:04,490
Look, look, if I was gonna get copyright-striked, if I was
gonna get, like, copyright-striked, I want all the companies

33
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:06,010
fight each other for my $5.

34
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:10,190
Like, I don't want one single company to have that entire
$5.

35
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:13,410
I want all of those companies fight for it.

36
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:16,850
So, like, in the end, you know, they all get...

37
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:23,770
like 50 cents or some shit like I don't care now all three
of them will have to

38
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:40,070

like look if I'm gonna be playing like jazz songs from if

39
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:48,070
I'm gonna get striked I might as well just commit you know i
might as well fully commit and just play all the jazz music

have to share revenue anyway chat like like i was gonna get

00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:10,110

I finally did it.

69
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:26,070
Wait, okay.

70
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:27,790
I want to be like semi mewing.

71
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:32,510
Like I'm still in the process of getting better at mewing.

like people are typing in Chinese and I can't read.

74
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:43,470
So if they're like saying something that I should know let
me know.

75
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:46,250
Oh, oh, wait.

76
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:47,210

77
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:47,990
Okay.

78
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:56,870
Actually, I want that to be medium because I actually really
like, okay, we'll have a smaller head because, uh, no,

79
00:07:56,910 --> 00:08:03,510

abs?

80
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:07,210
Cause like, I just literally just went outside right now.

81
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:11,010
I went outside and I got chucked into the, apparently this
game has lore.

82
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:18,110
Apparently there's an animated showed that like appeared out
of nowhere and it was like a star studded cast and then

83
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:26,990
everyone forgot about it because it literally just came out
of nowhere like there was no advertising oh my god there was

84
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:39,770
like no advertising whatsoever but like it was like the
fucking the most star studded cast ever um yeah but like I

85
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:45,630
heard that this game has like intense lore Okay, and then we
don't have to worry about any of that.

86
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:46,330
Wait, hips.

87
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:48,050
Okay, yes.

88
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:51,470
And then I actually sort of want, like, nice thighs.

89
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:52,390
Ooh, no.

90
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:53,610

Ooh, yes.

93
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:58,970

94
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:00,750

Great new survivor.

I think that's...

108
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:47,150
I think that's good.

109
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:48,010
If I'm too...

110
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:49,130
Like...

111
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:53,750
If I'm too short, then like people will have a harder time
hitting me.

112
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:59,410
Because like they'll aim for head level, but like I'm so
short that like my head level isn't head level.

113
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:00,530
So...

114
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:01,010
Ah!

115
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:03,050

00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,480
Alright guys, here we go.

171
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,000
There's so much.

172
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,740
Wait, there's colors over there.

173
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,180
Do you think that's a good color?

174
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,020
Do you think that's friendly?

175
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:02,160
Hello?

176
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,260
Wait, there's so many colors around the world.

177
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,900
Wait, are those friendly colors?

178
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:10,520
Are those...

179
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:12,960
Whoa!

180
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:15,060
That must be friendly.

181
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:16,120
Oh!

182
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,640
That's not fair!

183
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:30,600
That's not fair!

184
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,740
I was following...

185
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:35,700
I was just...

186
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,660
I was just following the colors!

187
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,460
No!

188
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,520
All my items!

189
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,500
I had so many items!

190
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,620
I was rich!

191
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,620
Oh, I still have it.

192
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,280
Oh, thank God.

193
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,060
Thank God I still have it.

194
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:56,180
Hey, guys.

195
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:57,160
I still got it.

196
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:57,460
Nice.

197
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:58,680
Okay, everything's fine.

198
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,140
Okay.

199
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,120
All right.

200
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:00,800
Oh, my God.

201
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:01,300
Wait.

202
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:05,540
I can have costumes and dodo birds.

203
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,340
How do I get the dodo bird?

204
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,380
Guys, I'm okay, guys.

205
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,100
All right.

206
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:11,820
Everything is okay.

207
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,180
We're off to a good start.

208
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,760
We're off to a good start, guys.

209
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:23,920
I keep following the...

210
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:28,020
Guys, guys, following the colors is very dangerous.

211
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:35,960
I'm like those flies that follow the bright colors.

212
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:38,660
You know, like those flies that follow the zapper?

213
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:43,320
And you're like, ooh, follow the zapper.

214
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,320
You're tired.

215
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,120
Stop moving.

216
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,900
Ooh, pretty colors.

217
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,280
Wait, is this where I died?

218
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,160
Okay, we can easily fix this.

219
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:54,280
Wait, how the fuck?

220
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:56,260
Oh!

221
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,660
Wait, Santa Claus?

222
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,300
What is that?

223
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:07,760
It's okay.

224
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:08,560
We're back.

225
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:10,460
That's not bad.

226
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,720
Look, it's through Santa.

227
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,960
I got distracted by Santa.

228
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:19,260
It's okay, round three.

229
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:24,320
I got distracted by Santa!

230
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,780
I heard a ho ho ho ho!

231
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,020
Okay, let's turn up the gamma.

232
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:32,680
Alright, I know a lot of you guys kept yelling at me to turn
up.

233
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,400
Wait, how do you turn up gamma?

234
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,360
Where is that?

235
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,540
Where the fuck is that?

236
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,260
There's a gamma?

237
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:41,960
Can you actually...

238
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,160
Are you guys fucking with me?

239
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,920
Yeah, tap.

240
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:53,140
I don't know if you guys are fucking with me, or if there's
actual, like, it's oddly under key bindings.

241
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,100
It is?

242
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:54,960
Okay.

243
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:56,260
Where is it?

244
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,260
Oh, there you go.

245
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,780
Do we do gamma 1 or gamma 2?

246
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,920
Tab type gamma.

247
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:09,460
And type, uh, should this be 3 or 4?

248
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:10,760
Oh, wait, you guys can't see.

249
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:15,340
Is it gamma 1 or 2, guys?

250
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:17,460
it?

251
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:18,780
One or two?

252
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:22,220
Yes.

253
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:23,760
Thanks.

254
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,100
That's very helpful.

255
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,160
Okay, I'm gonna put three.

256
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:32,280
Alright.

257
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:33,720
That should be fine.

258
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:34,980
Okay.

259
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:35,760
Good.

260
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:36,940
Alright.

261
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,360
Did it fix anything?

262
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,920
Did it fix anything, guys?

263
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,200
Because I can't tell.

264
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:46,540
Okay.

265
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,660
Oh, we bring down the music a little bit more.

266
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,020
Okay.

267
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:54,260
I'll bring it down a little bit more.

268
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,320
Yeah, I can't.

269
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:57,540
Oh, I didn't hit apply.

270
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,920
Sorry, I'm a little special.

271
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,240
There we go.

272
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,580
That should work.

273
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,060
Did it fix anything?

274
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:10,300
I should have asked Hiro to, like, help me explore note.

275
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,640
Are you the one I've been waiting for?

276
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,680

Dokey number one and two.

00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:01,680
Did not do so well in this world.

284
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:09,760
Bad news.

Okay.

Cool.

00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,200
Oh, there it is.

00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,080
Nice.

295
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,280

296
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:34,440
Nice.

297
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,080
Oh, level up is available?

298
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,200
Okay.

299
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:38,560
I can level up now.

300
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,580
Alright, what do we get, guys?

301
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:41,580
Is it still health?

302
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:43,780
Is it...

303
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:45,180
Is it still health?

304
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:49,140
Do we really need gamma 4?

305
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,800
Do we really need...

306
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:51,280
Wait?

307
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,000
Oh, okay.

308
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,100
Okay, wait.

309
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:54,220
Yay!

310
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,440
Alright.

311
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,580
I leveled up.

312
00:18:58,660 --> 00:18:59,560
I'm slowly learning.

313
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,620
Okay, let me...

314
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:04,100
Apparently, people keep yelling at me to do Gamma 4.

315
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,060
Gamma 4.

316
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:07,480
Whoa!

317
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:10,660
Guys!

318
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,700
This is a whole different game.

319
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,420
Oh my god!

320
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:19,920
Oh my god!

321
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:20,400

See?

329
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,300
Doki number three is learning from one and two.

330
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,560
This is bad.

331
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:35,300
All right, here.

332
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:36,360
All right.

333
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:38,180
All right.

334
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,240
There's no way I die from this.

335
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,120
All right.

336
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:50,800
Doki number three.

337
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,400
four coming in hot.

338
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:57,120
Don't worry.

339
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:02,600
Doki number four has learned from all the mistakes from all
the other dokees.

340
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:08,180
All the other dokees they've learned.

341
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,360
They have learned.

342
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:11,340
Don't worry.

343
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,060
It's fine.

344
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:14,120
There's gonna be so much armor.

345
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:17,340
I don't know where to go.

346
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,060
Where's the map?

347
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:19,900
Oh, there's the map.

348
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:20,800
What the fuck?

349
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:21,860
That's just it.

350
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,980
That's just all the map.

351
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:24,780
That's me.

352
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:25,620
Right there.

353
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:27,280
All right.

354
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,160
Is there like any way I can go?

00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,420

00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,280
It's okay, guys, I'm learning.

386
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,400
I got raw meat now.

387
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,400
I did it.

388
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:57,880
Yay!

389
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,140
Oh, I should punch some trees.

390
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,100
Oh, that's a lot.

391
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,120
What the fuck?

392
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,360

393
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,440

I'm so fucking strong.

396
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,180
Those looks like herbivores.

397
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:20,060
Wait, all of them look like herbivores, except for that one
raptor.

398
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:25,500
I can harvest a bush for berries, but I'm not hungry yet, I
think.

399
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,540
How do I get water, though?

400
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,660
I wonder.

401
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,060
Wait, that doesn't look like a herb.

402
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:32,000
Why are they like the herb?

403
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:33,060
No, they're all herbivores.

404
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:33,660
Yeah.

405
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,020
They're all herbivores.

406
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:35,900
They're all friends.

407
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:37,800
Guys.

408
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:38,860
They're all friends.

409
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:39,980
Watch this, guys.

410
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:40,800
Oh!

411
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:42,680
Wait, this tree is still alive.

412
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,320
Oh, never mind.

413
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:45,100
Okay.

414
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,280
Yay!

415
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,640
Bro, I'm so fucking strong.

416
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,380
Is that poop?

417
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,200
We might need this.

418
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,680
Wait, somebody dropped it.

419
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:58,860
Thank you, Cancer.

420
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,900
I can't believe they would waste, like, good fertilizer like
that.

421
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,520
Poop is good fertilizer.

422
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,960
Are you friend-shaped?

423
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:16,720
Are you friend-shaped?

424
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:19,920
It's fine.

425
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:21,000
He doesn't know how to fly.

00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:22,420
Get over here.

427
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:24,120
You don't know how to get over here.

428
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:24,280
Get over here.

429
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,180
Get over here!

430
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:27,100
I'm hungry!

431
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,240
Diet is canon and Lord, you learn from your past life
mistakes.

432
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:34,900
It's so funny.

433
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:36,500
Doki 5 is canon.

00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:42,940
It ran away.

438
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,900
Why would it run away from me?

439
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,060
I've been nothing but kind.

440
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,300

like, they make a lot of babies and they also fuck a lot.

570
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:29,730
So, like, it's, like, scientifically accurate if you think
about it.

571
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:36,670
Because all they do when they are born is just they want to
bang and then when they want to bang and make babies.

572
00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:39,130
So technically all insects are whores.

1122
01:10:32,740 --> 01:10:33,280

01:10:45,020 --> 01:10:46,320

01:10:55,330 --> 01:10:57,270
It's okay, we can get a new dragon.

1125
01:11:00,050 --> 01:11:01,770
We'll get new dragoons, guys.

1126
01:11:02,050 --> 01:11:02,430
It's fine.

1127
01:11:03,610 --> 01:11:05,450
And pretend that we never lost you.

1128
01:11:06,250 --> 01:11:08,330
You know, it's like how, like, people would...

1129
01:11:08,330 --> 01:11:10,170
Okay, it's so fucked up for me to say.

1130
01:11:10,550 --> 01:11:14,250
But, like, you know, there's, like, people that actually do
that.

1131
01:11:14,330 --> 01:11:16,250
Where they'll just buy the same pet.

1132
01:11:16,450 --> 01:11:17,690
And then you just rename it.

1133
01:11:17,950 --> 01:11:19,850
And then it's like they never died.

1134
01:11:19,950 --> 01:11:21,350
So, like, some people have done that.

1135
01:11:21,410 --> 01:11:24,710
Where they'll be like, my pet is, like, 80...

1136
01:11:24,710 --> 01:11:27,130
It's, like, the oldest living pet in the world.

1137
01:11:27,290 --> 01:11:28,850
Like 70 plus years old.

1138
01:11:29,290 --> 01:11:32,250
But then like the mom would just secretly replace it every
time.

1139
01:11:32,770 --> 01:11:34,450
And just name it the same thing.

1140
01:11:37,150 --> 01:11:38,390
So we're gonna do that.

1141
01:11:50,650 --> 01:11:51,250

1142
01:11:55,890 --> 01:11:56,490

01:12:01,370 --> 01:12:03,990
So this is not really our home.

1148
01:12:04,490 --> 01:12:05,510

A forbidden nugget.

You know what?

1215
01:16:24,410 --> 01:16:27,870
The reason why dodo birds are extinct is because apparently
they're really delicious.

1216
01:16:29,470 --> 01:16:31,260
That people just ate all of them.

1253
01:19:17,820 --> 01:19:18,900

1255
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:21,580
He's in the kingdom.

01:19:21,940 --> 01:19:23,680
Oh, my God.

1257
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:23,980
What?

1258
01:19:25,700 --> 01:19:27,880
They captured these people.

1259
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:28,300
Oh, my God.

1260
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:29,060
Oh my god!

1261
01:19:29,560 --> 01:19:30,660
He has prisoners?

1262
01:19:31,740 --> 01:19:33,040
I don't want to make him in.

1263
01:19:33,340 --> 01:19:37,440
This person that lives here is so crazy.

1264
01:19:37,980 --> 01:19:38,880
He's crazy?

1265
01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:50,300
He is a lie.

1266
01:19:51,060 --> 01:19:54,080
He sounds like really like a girl.

1267
01:19:54,340 --> 01:19:56,840
He's very like cute sounding.

1268
01:19:57,680 --> 01:19:58,360
But he's crazy.

1269
01:19:58,760 --> 01:19:59,860
He's crazy.

1270
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:02,160

1271
01:20:03,040 --> 01:20:03,360

1315
01:23:50,700 --> 01:23:50,920
Hello?

1316
01:23:54,080 --> 01:23:57,080
He wants to get back.

1317
01:23:57,900 --> 01:24:07,520
But I don't know if they will get back so I don't know if
they might start The server told that she doesn't know if

1318
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:08,900
she wants to make eggs left.

1319
01:24:08,980 --> 01:24:10,540
She's trying to make eggs, I think.

1320
01:24:10,640 --> 01:24:11,960
Oh, yeah, that's fine.

1321
01:24:11,980 --> 01:24:12,960
We can restart server.

1322
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:13,360
Wait a minute.

1323
01:24:14,100 --> 01:24:18,020
If we restart it, it's all the things we can do.

1324
01:24:18,160 --> 01:24:19,780
Go to like five minutes before it ends.

1325
01:24:20,040 --> 01:24:20,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1326
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:21,520
That's fine.

1327
01:24:21,620 --> 01:24:22,520
We can restart it.

1328
01:24:31,630 --> 01:24:33,390
Apparently there's like a bug or something.

1329
01:24:33,570 --> 01:24:34,450
There's like a bug?

1330
01:24:36,610 --> 01:24:39,690
Somebody has like something which is like being a server.

1331
01:24:40,190 --> 01:24:40,650
Oh.

1332
01:24:41,010 --> 01:24:42,190
You can find it like earlier.

1333
01:24:43,310 --> 01:24:46,890
Because the tour is not fun, people can't enter the server.

1334
01:24:47,430 --> 01:24:48,390
Oh, that's weird.

1335
01:24:49,050 --> 01:24:49,630
That's weird.

1336
01:24:51,250 --> 01:24:53,730
Oh my god, this guy actually has a fucking zoo.

1337
01:24:54,510 --> 01:24:55,610
It's actually crazy.

1338
01:24:59,510 --> 01:25:00,850
Alright, we might have to...

1339
01:25:00,850 --> 01:25:01,990
We might have to...

1340
01:25:01,990 --> 01:25:03,550
We're gonna restart the server.

1341
01:25:03,870 --> 01:25:05,050
It's been a nice tour, though.

1342
01:25:05,250 --> 01:25:07,570
I'm enjoying looking around the art server.

1343
01:25:08,510 --> 01:25:09,490
I haven't learned much.

1344
01:25:12,770 --> 01:25:16,770
I didn't really learn how to play, but like, I'm having a
good time exploring.

1345
01:25:23,880 --> 01:25:28,480
We can go to, I think, one more person's house.

1346
01:25:28,760 --> 01:25:29,180
Oh, okay.

1347
01:25:29,460 --> 01:25:29,780
Yeah, yeah.

1348
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:32,500
I can get you in trouble and like...

1349
01:25:32,500 --> 01:25:35,560
I will be in Junya's house.

1350
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:40,240
It's been a fun tour.

1351
01:25:40,340 --> 01:25:42,280
I've been enjoying seeing everybody's houses.

1352
01:25:42,920 --> 01:25:45,760

They're like, yeah, like he handcuffed several kids.

1420
01:33:58,600 --> 01:33:59,740
Why did he do it though?

1421
01:33:59,840 --> 01:34:01,840
Because he's a fucking troll.

1422
01:34:02,580 --> 01:34:03,360
Because he's crazy.

1423
01:34:04,280 --> 01:34:04,280

I've seen an ugly base, but not a hero's base.

1439
01:35:55,420 --> 01:35:57,360

They can't tell you what they're actually called.

1467
01:38:08,840 --> 01:38:09,720
The P is silent.

1468
01:38:09,840 --> 01:38:11,000

1469
01:38:12,080 --> 01:38:14,200
Guys, it's always been peterodactyl.

1470
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:15,800
It's like dodo birds.

1471
01:38:16,200 --> 01:38:18,340
You don't know how to, what the fuck they taste like.

1472
01:38:19,100 --> 01:38:20,980
They were historical records.

1473
01:38:21,100 --> 01:38:23,500
Oh yeah, someone tried to actually me.

1474
01:38:23,940 --> 01:38:25,400
Garlic, thank you for the super chat thingy thingy.

1475
01:38:25,500 --> 01:38:28,400
Historical records writings indicate that they didn't taste
very good.

1476
01:38:28,620 --> 01:38:31,780
But they were eaten to extinction because it was the only
meat around for miles.

1477
01:38:32,080 --> 01:38:34,620
Like they would park boats on the island to eat them.

1478
01:38:34,900 --> 01:38:35,720
Wait, what?

1479
01:38:36,240 --> 01:38:37,440
They would park boats?

1480
01:38:37,800 --> 01:38:39,140
There's like other, there's fish.

1481
01:38:44,760 --> 01:38:46,420
What were fish then?

1482
01:38:46,840 --> 01:38:48,920
Like, what were fish?

1483
01:38:50,520 --> 01:38:53,160
No, they described as tough but good.

1484
01:38:54,600 --> 01:39:00,140
And like, some hunted dodo is only for the gizzards because
the most delicious part of the bird.

1485
01:39:00,620 --> 01:39:02,420
Yeah, see, I told you.

1486
01:39:03,140 --> 01:39:11,020
You can't actually mean Wikipedia, which is the best of uh
yeah see there's always people saying dodo's must have

1487
01:39:11,020 --> 01:39:18,720
tasted uh see like okay some people say look it's like
preferences some are like oh it wasn't that great but then

1488
01:39:18,720 --> 01:39:22,220
others are saying that um they were good

1489
01:39:27,720 --> 01:39:33,260
let's see how big were dodo's they were like 40 pounds oh my
god they were like bigger than turkeys

1490
01:39:36,640 --> 01:39:43,860
mid 17th century taking straight blue pairs are very
numerous as well as other birds their birds lacked wings

1491
01:39:43,860 --> 01:39:53,540
blah blah blah blah uh nevertheless their belly and breast
were of a pleasant flavor see look at that okay nevertheless

1492
01:39:53,540 --> 01:40:04,900
their belly and breasts were of a pleasant flavor there you
go there you go guys i told you guys it's all about

1493
01:40:04,900 --> 01:40:14,700
preferences some people don't doesn't like beef there some
people don't like beef but then yet they still eat it so as

1494
01:40:14,700 --> 01:40:25,380
we'll eat anything that isn't hard tacked that's true that's
so true stream tack education uh to be fair i hate turkey i

1495
01:40:25,380 --> 01:40:32,940
don't i don't understand why people like to eat turkey
because i find turkey to be like very dry and uh not i mean

1496
01:40:32,940 --> 01:40:38,740
not like and flavorless You have to put like fucking gravy
or something to make it taste like great.

1497
01:40:38,800 --> 01:40:45,540
You need to put actual like gravy and and like cranberries
to actually make it like taste like something.

1498
01:40:46,120 --> 01:40:50,000
But like I feel like turkey is very dry.

1499
01:40:50,480 --> 01:40:51,020
Not dry.

1500
01:40:51,180 --> 01:40:54,260
I mean turkey is very flavorless in general.

1501
01:40:55,880 --> 01:40:58,000
Yeah I think like turkey is inferior chicken.

1502
01:40:58,300 --> 01:40:59,040
It truly is.

1503
01:40:59,100 --> 01:41:00,260
I mean they're stupid.

1504
01:41:00,520 --> 01:41:04,540
I mean to be very chicken is like like just that's.

1505
01:41:04,560 --> 01:41:14,680
stupid but turkeys is like they're it's like turkeys we've
read we domesticated them so hard that like like have you

1511
01:42:03,540 --> 01:42:04,020
Okay.

1512
01:42:06,280 --> 01:42:08,420
Alright, wild turkeys are very intelligent animals.

1513
01:42:08,580 --> 01:42:09,540
What the fuck did we do?

1514
01:42:16,240 --> 01:42:16,720
Wait.

1515
01:42:17,220 --> 01:42:19,560
Apparently, they used to be highly intelligent animals.

1516
01:42:19,820 --> 01:42:21,540
What the fuck did we do to the turkey?

1517
01:42:22,280 --> 01:42:23,220
Oh my god.

1518
01:42:23,460 --> 01:42:23,900
No!

1519
01:42:28,800 --> 01:42:30,580
Oh my god.

1520
01:42:32,580 --> 01:42:34,380
They used to be smart.

1521
01:42:34,640 --> 01:42:35,460
Oh my god, it's like me.

1522
01:42:35,600 --> 01:42:36,500
I used to be smart.

1523
01:42:36,680 --> 01:42:37,580
And then I started streaming.

1524
01:42:38,300 --> 01:42:39,420
I used to have...

1525
01:42:39,420 --> 01:42:44,680
Like, I used to have a professor that, like, really liked me
and said I was really smart.

1526
01:42:45,060 --> 01:42:46,880
And then I don't know what happened.

1527
01:42:47,020 --> 01:42:47,960
I just started streaming.

1528
01:42:48,160 --> 01:42:48,540
I don't...

1529
01:42:51,360 --> 01:42:53,120
I did higher education.

1530
01:42:54,760 --> 01:42:58,480
We bread and buttered and art players is every good.

1531
01:43:03,220 --> 01:43:03,840
Alright.

1532
01:43:04,540 --> 01:43:05,060
Oh!

1533
01:43:09,810 --> 01:43:11,790
Alright, we're just waiting.

1534
01:43:12,770 --> 01:43:15,590
We're just waiting for the serve at the moment.

1535
01:43:27,700 --> 01:43:29,340
We're just waiting.

1536
01:43:30,120 --> 01:43:32,660
The day Doki's brain shrunk three sizes.

1537
01:43:33,480 --> 01:43:34,280
So true.

1538
01:43:39,900 --> 01:43:46,580
whoa sorry i don't know if my chrome wait is my chrome oh
good my chrome is not on okay thank god you guys didn't hear

1539
01:43:46,580 --> 01:43:56,780
it let me refresh and see the servers back up i know i did
say like i told hero to let me know but the server's still

1540
01:43:56,780 --> 01:44:03,820
not back up yeah so the reason why they had to restart the
server is because apparently somebody did something that

1541
01:44:03,820 --> 01:44:10,000
bugged the whole server So they're trying to figure out,
they couldn't figure out what, who did it?

1542
01:44:10,200 --> 01:44:18,100
I guess, I guess they couldn't figure out who, it wasn't me,
because it was happening before I was there, guys.

1543
01:44:18,400 --> 01:44:19,720
It wasn't me!

1544
01:44:20,140 --> 01:44:23,300
It was happening before me, I'll join.

1545
01:44:24,400 --> 01:44:25,880
So, what did I do?

1546
01:44:25,960 --> 01:44:32,460
I literally, all I did was, I died three times to gravity,
and then, like, three times to a fucking mosquito.

1547
01:44:32,920 --> 01:44:34,120
Like, what did I do?

1548
01:44:35,620 --> 01:44:37,580
What did I do?

1549
01:44:41,660 --> 01:44:42,180
Anyway.

1550
01:44:44,840 --> 01:44:48,980
So they're saying that somebody bugged the server.

1551
01:44:49,640 --> 01:44:52,740
And then they've been trying to figure out what it was.

1552
01:44:52,840 --> 01:44:53,280
But they couldn't.

1553
01:44:53,340 --> 01:44:54,940
So that's why they're resetting the server.

1554
01:44:55,760 --> 01:44:57,780
So we're still waiting for it.

1555
01:45:11,650 --> 01:45:12,930
We're just waiting.

1556
01:45:14,490 --> 01:45:24,030
i think like after the tour after the tour and we i know i
said it before but after the tour and domesticating a dragon

1557
01:45:24,030 --> 01:45:30,830
we're gonna call it here because i'm getting a little eepie
just getting a little eepie right now

1558
01:45:39,110 --> 01:45:48,710
yeah it's really late um i might push the sandland stream um
a bit later

1559
01:45:52,770 --> 01:46:02,070
alarms being checked in my apartment so like i'm gonna see
if like uh i'm gonna see if fire alarms will be checked

1560
01:46:02,070 --> 01:46:13,150
before my stream and and then if um if the fire alarm people
doesn't come to check it then i might stream a little i

1561
01:46:13,150 --> 01:46:23,790
might push the stream back until uh until uh until like they
check it because they have to come into my pc room i think

1562
01:46:23,790 --> 01:46:30,830
it's a little awkward you know i think you know it's like
the xqc thing where i don't know you guys seen the that one

1563
01:46:30,830 --> 01:46:40,170
of the infamous xqc clips where uh he was you know streaming
and then the maids came in and like like his maids came in

1564
01:46:40,170 --> 01:46:44,450
and was just like judging him like i don't want to be judged
uh

1565

1757
02:01:22,830 --> 02:01:24,670
Okay, and I pooped a little bit.

1758
02:01:25,010 --> 02:01:27,210
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, it's okay.

1759
02:01:27,370 --> 02:01:28,630

I pooped from the fear.

1764
02:01:39,910 --> 02:01:47,530
If you got slapped by a prehistoric animal, you too would
fucking poop out of fear.

1765
02:01:47,770 --> 02:01:49,090
Don't fucking lie.

creatures.
