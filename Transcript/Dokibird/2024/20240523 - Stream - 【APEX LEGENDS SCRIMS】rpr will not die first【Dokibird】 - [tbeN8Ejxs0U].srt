it's just scrims it's not even the real tournament yeah
scrims that we didn't even know where we landed two two

28
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:52,350
minutes before you started you were the one that gave me the
landing spot you asked me to give you landing spots and then

29
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:55,590
you landing spots are not enough.

30
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:57,450
You need to give me 10 for each map.

31
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:00,110
I wasn't the one that made the rules for this.

32
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:02,990
They were like, you have to list like 10.

33
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:04,730
Okay, they wanted more.

34
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:07,970
I like shortened it because I was like, I'm not fucking
asking.

35
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:11,150
I'm not fucking asking RPR for 10 landing spots.

36
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:11,950
It was like eight.

37
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:14,490
I don't even know 10 landing spots on the map.

38
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:15,310
Give me top five.

39
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:16,370
You know what they asked for me?

40
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:17,570
They said give us eight.

41
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:19,130
And I was like, I'm just going to give them five.

42
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:20,510
I was like, there's no way.

43
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:23,030
I barely know five.

44
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:29,110
Remember when you asked me I was that oh shit how like what
the fuck is this?

45
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:35,050
They wanted okay to be fair They also wanted me to be there
at 10 a.m.

46
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:39,310
To like see who's gonna get the landing spots But I was like
I don't want to wake up at 10 man.

47
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:49,110
I don't I don't Yeah I don't even wake up for LGS about
they're like okay you can if you're busy Okay, but to be

48
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:52,410
fair they're like it to everybody is like oh you can't make
it to 10 a.m.

49
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:54,410
Just let us know in advance And I was like, oh, thank God.

50
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:58,390
I don't have to wake up at 10 in the morning to figure out
where the fuck we're landing.

51
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:02,130
Okay, how are we the laziest team in the fucking lobby?

52
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:03,970
But we got the best landing spot.

53
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:05,190
This doesn't make any sense.

54
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:09,470
We're just that lucky.

55
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:12,830
We got siphon and barometer.

56
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:21,590
Okay, if we get fucking absolutely fucked over with the best
landing spots, this is our PR's fault.

57
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:23,350
How is it like?

58
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:29,450
Okay, listen because you're the one that chose those landing
spots You chose these landing spots.

59
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:32,690
I gave us the best possible conditions.

60
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:41,070
I gave us the best possible conditions to win Yeah, but if
we don't win then it's IGL's fault Deep does IGLing no you

61
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:43,090
said IGL can never be a bloodhound.

62
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:47,750
Yeah, she can't be she's on bloodhound I'm tired of being
wrong.

63
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:56,310
I don't want to be voted all the time Yeah, that's why you
are being right Someone else just take the fault for one.

64
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,490
Well, then someone else be IGL.

65
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:02,250
Not me.

66
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:05,430
You have to be IGL because you're AOGS champion.

67
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:07,050
Yeah, you're AOGS champion.

68
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:07,630
Exactly.

69
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:09,410
Oh, no.

70
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:11,650
I was cursed with such a high IQ.

71
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:12,690
Holy shit.

72
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:16,430
Such an high IQ, but yeah, you don't win this scrim.

73
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:17,070
I don't know.

74
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:21,710
I am not at fault for my teammates' actions.

75
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:32,630
is the igl's fault that is not how this is 100 how it works
i've seen competitive apex on reddit that's exactly how it

76
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:38,090
works okay reddit hates me by the way they think i do
nothing for my team

77
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:48,650
but they're they're but but they're right they're normies
normies are always right yeah that's like me watching uh

78
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:55,090
football for once a week uh for the next three years and
being like You know, he should have went left.

79
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:57,830
And then he should have kicked the ball to the right.

80
00:06:58,030 --> 00:06:58,810
And then he's right.

81
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:00,750
And he's right.

82
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:03,650
You're right.

83
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:04,230
You're right.

84
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:05,750
Listen, listen, it's simple.

85
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:06,650
Apex is simple.

86
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:07,930
Kill everyone, win the game.

87
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:09,450
But what if you don't kill everyone?

88
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:10,550
Ditto, can you kill everybody?

89
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:11,370
Then you lose.

90
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:15,650
Maybe if Afya don't die first.

91
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:18,730
Ditto, what is your stream title?

92
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:19,510

It's okay, it's okay!

100
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:28,910
We don't have life.

101
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:33,790
Okay, I guess I'm on Bloodhound, I guess.

102
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:38,870
Okay, also Sound Guy, I turned down RPR and turned up Ditto.

You went too far.

142
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:43,630
There's a line you cannot cross.

143
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:46,010
And you crossed it.

144
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:50,710
What do you mean?

145
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:52,310
What's the line?

146
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:56,950
If there was a line, you would have said no.

147
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:00,870
Listen, I'm tired of his slander.

148
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:04,550
If there was a line, you would have said, you wouldn't even
be here.

149
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:08,370
Like, I can't take this shit no more.

150
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:09,910
I'm actually going to become Menhara.

151
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:11,090
This is crazy.

152
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:14,870
Wait, you're not already?

153
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:16,810
I'm on my way.

154
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:18,870
I'm not fucking Sundhara.

155
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:21,010
Is he a, Ditto, is he a Menhara?

156
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:29,950
you know yeah i'm all my way yeah me too i think so too if i
am manhira then you reach the fucking he's he invented

157
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:42,410
manhira he said the duties what manhira and he said he like
manhira okay i said a little bit of manhira is okay me and

158
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:50,610
you reese both agree that 30 manhira is okay wait what's
what is considered 30 how would you know when somebody's 30

159
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:59,030
manhira okay but like what what it is a 30 yeah how can you
tell somebody's a 30 manhara whatever there's like 31 well

160
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:06,190
okay so here's the scale if they're at 100 then you're going
to die if they're at 30 you're just gonna have a little bit

161
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:14,170
of like uh like a little bit of a little bit of a thrill
action in your life like every now and then what's a thrill

162
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:22,530
like what's the oh you're still a little scared for your
life every now and then you know like action you know you

163
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:32,850
speak from experience like you've had the 30 manhara okay
but like what tips it over the edge what makes it a 31

164
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:42,450
manhara versus a 30 wait but then getting stabbed but a
hundred percent you die so like not every stabbing would

00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:44,610
We're cool here.

331
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:45,230
Okay.

332
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:47,290
I'm gonna charge my Sentinel.

333
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:49,050
Now the real game has started.

334
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:49,590
All right.

335
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:51,470
I'm about to Krayber everyone.

336
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:52,730
Ooh, sniper bag.

337
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:53,910
This was juice.

338
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:56,110
Oh, this is a juice package.

339
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:58,250
All right, let's get to Joan.

340
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:00,310
All right, we're right behind you.

341
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:02,870
If I read this wrong, it's Zero's fault.

342
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:05,550
It's Zero, why it's in Zero's fault.

343
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:07,490
I watch him for zone predictions.

344
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:09,250
You watch him for zone.

345
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:10,390
Yeah.

346
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:12,370
So if this is wrong, this is his fault.

347
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:12,830
Just saying.

348
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:13,710
Yeah, it's you.

349
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:14,870
Oh my god.

350
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:17,090

Nobody.

359
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:27,050

We're taking our house.

00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:08,170
We got to kill these motherfuckers.

00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:09,350
I cracked them, though.

434
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:11,530
This is disrespectful behavior.

435
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:13,490
They took it.

436
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:14,690

00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:35,650
I have no shield cells, guys.

453
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:36,530
You guys have extra shield cells.

454
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:37,370
Oh, they're gonna eat them!

455
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:38,370
Oh, okay.

456
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:38,770

00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:32,410
We can already see how it's going to end.

684
00:36:33,850 --> 00:36:36,770
I've trolled this entire game, and we won.

685
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:39,370
Like, I'm kind of sure what we're going to fucking do.

686
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:41,350
Bro, you did a fucking finisher.

687
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:49,310
I've been playing Flatline Sentinel.

688
00:36:49,310 --> 00:36:59,910
like did you and i were so confused that last fight like in
the fight right before the last fight i jumped in and no

689
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:07,190
scope the revenant for 88 i think like all three of us were
fighting different teams we were all fighting different

690
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:13,930
teams during the last fight this is the most unserious i've
ever been in my life like what's gonna happen if we actually

691
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:25,410
do serious shit okay to be fair to be whole lobby might be a
bit more serious I was just no scoping people would say I

692
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:33,370
was strolling so hard like who the fuck please flatline
Sentinel it's you you're you're metacrafting you're

693
00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:42,990
metacrafting I'm frontlining with a scent I'm pouring in no
scoping people this is the strat guys if you're not doing

694
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:52,770
that shit you're not winning land exactly guys guys this is
it that's what RC did brought a sentinel in right ditto yes

695
00:37:52,770 --> 00:38:04,390
yeah ditto give us some rc strats how do they do it how do
they win land because because um i'm the fourth player first

696
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:13,370
player should they four be three then that one yeah so they
cheated because so they're hacking yeah destroyer are you

697
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:23,850
destroyer actually actually i won with tn clash and we got
champion oh that's true that's true that's true this is it

698
00:38:23,850 --> 00:38:30,850
fourth player no way we might we might actually lose a few
games to like not show them our true power that's true i

699
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:36,010
and then we fuck them up on saturday

I guess we'll never know.

714
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:22,550
They're too embarrassed to admit it.

715
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,540
Who is even the best team?

716
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:28,100

She's not going to give me the one.

725
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:15,020
Just look at her vibe.

726
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:17,560

00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,680

There's no way these guys can shoot back.

826
00:46:40,490 --> 00:46:41,550
That's fucked up.

01:00:25,610 --> 01:00:26,050
Yeah.

1004
01:00:27,390 --> 01:00:27,750
Yeah.

1005
01:00:30,530 --> 01:00:33,990
you're so right that would be so mad

1006
01:00:37,770 --> 01:00:45,930
that's why that's why we say it when he's in the bathroom

1008
01:00:59,010 --> 01:01:00,030
It's okay.

1009
01:01:00,470 --> 01:01:00,990
We're...

1010
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:01,750
Guys, it's okay.

1011
01:01:02,170 --> 01:01:02,810
We're...

1012
01:01:02,810 --> 01:01:04,670
Well, we're gonna win this next one.

1013
01:01:05,050 --> 01:01:06,610
Yeah, yeah, sure.

1014
01:01:08,690 --> 01:01:11,250
If RPR didn't throw, we win.

1015
01:01:11,670 --> 01:01:12,290
Yeah, I know!

1016
01:01:12,470 --> 01:01:13,330
He was trolling!

1017
01:01:13,710 --> 01:01:15,030
He was trolling us!

1018
01:01:16,210 --> 01:01:19,730
Like, he said this spot was, like, the best spot.

1019
01:01:20,030 --> 01:01:20,910
And then we died.

1020
01:01:21,790 --> 01:01:22,190
Yes.

1021
01:01:22,570 --> 01:01:23,030
Yeah.

1022
01:01:23,610 --> 01:01:24,190
Yeah.

1023
01:01:24,370 --> 01:01:25,590
That's so messed up.

1024
01:01:25,750 --> 01:01:27,350
He truly is a Minhera.

1025
01:01:28,630 --> 01:01:31,050
Can we die when we get the base spot?

1026
01:01:31,350 --> 01:01:32,230
Yeah, I know, right?

1027
01:01:32,590 --> 01:01:34,730
If it's the best spot, we wouldn't have died.

1028
01:01:35,210 --> 01:01:36,370
That is so true.

1029
01:01:36,610 --> 01:01:38,450
It would...

1030
01:01:39,010 --> 01:01:42,150
The best spot means that we should live.

1031
01:01:44,030 --> 01:01:44,510
Like...

1032
01:01:44,510 --> 01:01:44,650
Oh,

1033
01:01:48,410 --> 01:01:49,110
she's coming back.

1034
01:01:49,330 --> 01:01:50,670
Welcome back, RPR.

1035
01:01:51,990 --> 01:01:52,590
Oh, he's not back.

1036
01:01:53,230 --> 01:01:54,450
RPR, welcome back.

1037
01:01:54,710 --> 01:01:55,330
We missed you.

1038
01:01:55,650 --> 01:01:58,470
Toilet one was taken, so I had to pee in toilet two.

1039
01:01:58,630 --> 01:01:59,350
Nice.

1040
01:01:59,670 --> 01:02:00,890

We're, like, talking about good you whereas I, yeah.

1042
01:02:04,010 --> 01:02:05,870
I don't know if I stop fucking lying to my face.

1043
01:02:08,130 --> 01:02:09,490
Are you trying to say Ditto would lie?

1044
01:02:10,110 --> 01:02:10,970
She said yes.

1045
01:02:11,230 --> 01:02:11,510
Yes.

1046
01:02:12,050 --> 01:02:19,110
Duggie, the last time I told him that my favorite Apex
player was up here, and he didn't believe me.

1047
01:02:19,750 --> 01:02:20,270
Wow!

Nice.

1082
01:06:09,090 --> 01:06:11,850
I have a destructor here if anyone wants it.

1083
01:06:12,570 --> 01:06:13,130
Okay.

1084
01:06:13,850 --> 01:06:14,490
It's all obvious.

1085
01:06:14,710 --> 01:06:14,990
Okay.

1086
01:06:15,650 --> 01:06:16,210

1087
01:06:16,210 --> 01:06:17,950
I'm using Nemesis and Monastive.

1088
01:06:18,530 --> 01:06:18,890
All right.

1089
01:06:19,110 --> 01:06:23,790
I am Hemlock Nemesis, but I'd rather have Hemlock Havoc.

1090
01:06:24,410 --> 01:06:26,890
Because I heard Havoc is, like, the gun now.

1091
01:06:27,610 --> 01:06:28,610
It's the only gun in the game.

1092
01:06:28,630 --> 01:06:29,590
game you ever need.

1093
01:06:29,850 --> 01:06:31,370
If you have Havoc, you don't need anything else.

1094
01:06:32,110 --> 01:06:33,250
What's this hammer point?

1095
01:06:33,490 --> 01:06:34,330
I don't need that.

1096
01:06:35,170 --> 01:06:37,370
I'm heading over for the knockdown shield.

1097
01:06:39,990 --> 01:06:40,790
Oh my god.

1098
01:06:40,990 --> 01:06:41,950
I want Havoc.

1099
01:06:43,110 --> 01:06:43,550
Yay.

1100
01:06:43,690 --> 01:06:44,070
A lot?

1101
01:06:44,290 --> 01:06:44,570
Okay.

1102
01:06:46,090 --> 01:06:48,090
Actually, I'll find a Havoc for us.

1103
01:06:49,130 --> 01:06:50,030
That's not my job.

1104
01:06:50,570 --> 01:06:52,330
I tell you what to go and not what to look.

1105
01:06:52,330 --> 01:06:55,910
Wait, there's a Havoc here where Ditto is and she didn't
ping it.

1106
01:06:56,310 --> 01:06:57,770
Oh, I didn't see it.

1107
01:06:57,870 --> 01:06:58,350
I didn't see it.

1108
01:06:58,630 --> 01:06:59,130
Wow!

1109
01:06:59,610 --> 01:07:00,670
Ditto what?

1110
01:07:00,730 --> 01:07:01,530
I didn't lose.

1111
01:07:02,130 --> 01:07:02,850
I didn't see.

1112
01:07:04,090 --> 01:07:04,790
I'm your fault.

1113
01:07:04,930 --> 01:07:05,690
He didn't tell me.

1114
01:07:06,770 --> 01:07:09,130
How am I supposed to tell you what you're seeing?

1115
01:07:09,130 --> 01:07:09,890
You're so right.

1116
01:07:10,670 --> 01:07:11,230
Venated.

1117
01:07:11,650 --> 01:07:12,230
Venated.

1118
01:07:12,750 --> 01:07:14,390
I can't give it to you.

1119
01:07:14,930 --> 01:07:15,510
I'm so sorry.

1120
01:07:15,510 --> 01:07:18,690
How am I supposed to tell you like what you're looking with
your own eyes?

1121
01:07:20,310 --> 01:07:21,110
What do you want?

1122
01:07:21,510 --> 01:07:22,930
You have to say, yeah.

1123
01:07:23,290 --> 01:07:24,950
You weren't certain of it though.

1124
01:07:25,310 --> 01:07:28,410
Yeah, there's no way I could know what you want.

1125
01:07:28,630 --> 01:07:32,370
English is her third language, RPR.

1126
01:07:32,670 --> 01:07:34,110
You have to be more.

1127
01:07:34,530 --> 01:07:36,270
It's my 14th language.

1128
01:07:37,810 --> 01:07:39,130
Don't get here, here.

1129

01:18:31,310 --> 01:18:33,050
I'm not going to be blamed for this.

1338
01:18:33,050 --> 01:18:34,210
I got shot by three different people.

1339
01:18:34,530 --> 01:18:35,970
I'm not going to be blamed for this.

1340
01:18:36,230 --> 01:18:37,130
Look at your death free cap.

1341
01:18:37,410 --> 01:18:39,190
You're not looking at your death free cap because you know.

1342
01:18:40,070 --> 01:18:42,150
Once again, this is your fault.

1343
01:18:42,430 --> 01:18:43,870
How is it my fault?

1344
01:18:44,210 --> 01:18:45,830
I got shot by a new castle.

1345
01:18:46,110 --> 01:18:48,270
This team doesn't have a fucking new castle.

1346
01:18:50,070 --> 01:18:52,630
So you get shot by mucus like I did.

1347
01:18:53,030 --> 01:18:53,150
Look at your death recap.

1348
01:18:53,150 --> 01:18:54,070
Look at your death recap.

1349
01:18:54,110 --> 01:18:55,990

1397
01:25:42,290 --> 01:25:51,970

instead of winning the game what are you focusing on that's

1398
01:25:51,970 --> 01:26:03,430
that's how we know up here you're starting you you're

1419
01:28:26,920 --> 01:28:28,380

Don't worry.

1424
01:28:37,020 --> 01:28:40,280
Now, after I get back in, I'm going to try so hard.

1425
01:28:41,300 --> 01:28:41,880
We're still cold.

1426
01:28:41,960 --> 01:28:43,240
We tell them not to start yet.

1427
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:44,080
I crashed.

1428
01:28:50,130 --> 01:28:50,990
Oh, I'm a giant.

1429
01:28:52,130 --> 01:28:53,170
I mean, you could play...

1430
01:28:53,170 --> 01:28:53,650
Oh, no.

1431
01:28:54,130 --> 01:28:54,750
Why do we...

1432
01:28:54,750 --> 01:28:55,330
Why do we...

1433
01:28:55,330 --> 01:28:56,930
Why do we want to be meta slaves?

1434
01:28:57,030 --> 01:28:57,250
You know what I mean?

1435
01:28:57,370 --> 01:28:58,150
Why not...

1436
01:28:58,150 --> 01:28:59,270
Because we're not winning.

1437
01:29:00,910 --> 01:29:03,370
We're not winning because of the comp, but like...

1438
01:29:03,370 --> 01:29:05,430
It really aimed the comp form.

1439
01:29:05,650 --> 01:29:07,390
It could be the comp issue.

1440
01:29:09,530 --> 01:29:11,390
It could be...

1441
01:29:11,390 --> 01:29:12,410
Wait, we'll see...

1442
01:29:12,410 --> 01:29:13,050
What's the code?

1443
01:29:13,310 --> 01:29:15,290
Okay, what comp would you play?

1444
01:29:15,750 --> 01:29:16,270
I don't know.

1445
01:29:16,410 --> 01:29:17,430
You're the IGL.

1446
01:29:18,730 --> 01:29:24,030
So if you want to switch the comp, but you don't have any
fucking ideas what to do then why do you say i want to swap

1447
01:29:24,030 --> 01:29:35,410
i'm just giving a suggestion uh suggestions from here on out
are banned wait we're fourth place guys we're not even

1448
01:29:35,410 --> 01:29:47,050
second yeah okay from here on out suggestions are banned
wait that's up i make the rules i gel if you want to make

1449
01:29:47,050 --> 01:29:52,690
the rules you can i gel okay but that's like That's pretty
fucked up.

1450
01:29:52,690 --> 01:29:54,390
Okay, let's do it.

1451
01:29:54,670 --> 01:29:55,510
Okay, we listen.

1452
01:29:56,170 --> 01:29:57,470
We listen to up here.

1453
01:29:57,550 --> 01:29:58,810
Yeah, we're good listeners.

1454
01:29:59,590 --> 01:30:00,250
Okay, okay.

1455
01:30:00,290 --> 01:30:04,810
If we listen to you and we don't win first, then I think
that's just an IGL problem at that point.

1456
01:30:05,790 --> 01:30:06,230
Yeah.

1457
01:30:06,450 --> 01:30:06,750
Yeah.

1458
01:30:06,910 --> 01:30:08,190
I will listen to every...

1459
01:30:08,190 --> 01:30:10,790
Yeah, I'm going to listen to every calm you say.

1460
01:30:11,110 --> 01:30:15,390
And like, I will make sure I wouldn't be super 100% focused.

1461
01:30:16,030 --> 01:30:17,510
So if you don't listen, what happens?

1462
01:30:17,930 --> 01:30:19,290
What if you don't listen?

1463
01:30:19,850 --> 01:30:20,970
Well, it's never going to happen.

1464
01:30:21,670 --> 01:30:23,610
What if your ADHD kicks in?

1465
01:30:24,130 --> 01:30:25,250
I don't have any HD.

1466
01:30:27,210 --> 01:30:28,470
You're a streamer.

1467
01:30:30,850 --> 01:30:32,210
I don't have ADHD.

1468
01:30:32,730 --> 01:30:33,570
I got tested.

1469
01:30:34,270 --> 01:30:35,750
I just diagnosed you.

1470
01:30:38,330 --> 01:30:39,710
Where's our land again?

1471
01:30:40,010 --> 01:30:40,350
I don't know.

1472
01:30:41,610 --> 01:30:41,990
Okay.

1473
01:30:42,410 --> 01:30:43,410
Well, there's a barometer.

1474
01:30:43,550 --> 01:30:44,210
Yeah, I heard it.

1475
01:30:44,310 --> 01:30:47,090
See, if I had ADHD, I wouldn't have heard it.

1476
01:30:47,410 --> 01:30:50,170
You heard it five minutes after I said it.

1477
01:30:55,110 --> 01:31:06,850
this is the com trust me i've done this for years i always
played lifeline bloodhound and raid yeah but like you

retires and just gets dumb like just forgets what it's like

1479
01:31:17,270 --> 01:31:24,550

We did have EVO armor for two years.

1486
01:31:37,130 --> 01:31:38,670

can that's the only thing that matters we are tsm they

1589
01:42:42,250 --> 01:42:50,310
killed us though yeah but that was not an aim issue it
wasn't no it was a brain issue on your behalf

1590
01:42:54,110 --> 01:43:03,110
get this house is our house yeah yeah we have a house ditto
i will wash our i want this i want this as well i want

1592
01:43:13,390 --> 01:43:21,110
who i am i'm imperial how imperial rpr tell me if they
pushing you they're not i think they're getting all charge

1593
01:43:21,110 --> 01:43:26,970
off of not i'll charge shield charge i i i have watched that
if you have a nade break their door but they're just gonna

1594
01:43:26,970 --> 01:43:35,030
wall it back yeah so what i'm gonna shoot them in the window
the door is broken why are you coming back with this stupid

1595
01:43:35,030 --> 01:43:43,030
fucking drone because they have the resources well there's a
nade here you want to use it you're better at aiming the

1596
01:43:43,030 --> 01:43:55,650
nade than us yes i got apparently i that's how it works pro
players have good aim on everything there's an indicator oh

1597
01:43:55,650 --> 01:44:01,550
they put it on the door broken shoot them they wait they
they they Did the door thing.

1598
01:44:03,210 --> 01:44:04,250
Yeah, we knew that was going to happen.

1599
01:44:05,470 --> 01:44:06,930
Then what's the point of needing the door?

1600
01:44:07,590 --> 01:44:12,230
Because maybe in the second that I broke the door, I could
see one of them and one clipped them.

1601
01:44:12,390 --> 01:44:13,490
But you didn't.

1602

1634
01:45:03,850 --> 01:45:05,270
I got a kill drone out for you.

1635
01:45:06,450 --> 01:45:06,650
Whoops.

1636
01:45:07,790 --> 01:45:08,670
Hey, I was done.

1637
01:45:10,310 --> 01:45:11,550
That was interesting.

1638
01:45:11,930 --> 01:45:14,150
That guy wanted to take me down with him.

1639
01:45:14,310 --> 01:45:15,330
It was some hater shit.

1640
01:45:17,070 --> 01:45:18,170
He was straight hating.

1641
01:45:18,810 --> 01:45:19,750
What did you do?

1642
01:45:20,410 --> 01:45:21,810
Why is he hating on you?

1643
01:45:22,550 --> 01:45:23,050
I don't know.

1644
01:45:24,190 --> 01:45:24,990
Some toxic shit.

1645
01:45:25,070 --> 01:45:26,310
These VTubers, I swear to God.

1646
01:45:26,450 --> 01:45:27,950
Yeah, so toxic.

1647
01:45:28,470 --> 01:45:29,910
Oh, I got purple guys.

1648
01:45:30,650 --> 01:45:32,430
We all got what's the third person?

1649
01:45:32,690 --> 01:45:33,770
Why do we see two dead boxes?

1650
01:45:34,790 --> 01:45:36,490
Third person's on the ground, maybe?

1651
01:45:37,530 --> 01:45:38,090
Oh, D-thousand.

1652
01:45:38,750 --> 01:45:39,590
Oh, there's an alt-xel.

1653
01:45:39,730 --> 01:45:40,190
Do we need it?

1654
01:45:40,250 --> 01:45:40,990
Let's go next.

1655
01:45:41,290 --> 01:45:42,310
You guys stay here.

1656
01:45:42,370 --> 01:45:43,670
As I said, I'm going to hold this.

1657
01:45:43,830 --> 01:45:44,870
You guys are going to hold the house.

1658
01:45:45,090 --> 01:45:45,490
There's a hash.

1659
01:45:47,210 --> 01:45:48,770
You guys are going to move it to zone.

1660
01:45:48,810 --> 01:45:50,270
You guys are going to move it to zone.

1661
01:45:50,850 --> 01:45:51,650
Someone's on my right.

1662
01:45:52,870 --> 01:45:53,830
I already have this spot.

1663
01:45:53,910 --> 01:45:54,330
What the fuck?

1664
01:45:54,530 --> 01:45:55,490
But they're in the zone there.

1665
01:45:55,750 --> 01:45:56,910
Almost can't almost get on there.

1666
01:45:57,010 --> 01:45:58,390
Okay, I'm heading over to you, RPR.

1667
01:45:58,930 --> 01:45:59,590
No, no, no, no.

1668
01:45:59,690 --> 01:46:00,370
Are you listening?

1669
01:46:00,630 --> 01:46:01,730
No, I forgot.

1670
01:46:02,250 --> 01:46:02,550
You guys...

1671
01:46:02,550 --> 01:46:05,250
You guys hold the fucking house and you move it to the zone.

1672
01:46:05,690 --> 01:46:07,170
Yeah, okay, I heard you this time.

1673
01:46:07,650 --> 01:46:08,470
Wait, they're behind us rock.

1674
01:46:09,230 --> 01:46:09,670
Yeah.

1675
01:46:10,030 --> 01:46:11,230
Yeah, they're looking at us.

1676
01:46:11,650 --> 01:46:12,190
I'm a mochi.

1677
01:46:13,250 --> 01:46:14,990
They're looking at me right here.

1678
01:46:16,210 --> 01:46:17,530
Why the fuck are they looking?

1679
01:46:17,750 --> 01:46:18,890
Who the fuck...

1680
01:46:18,890 --> 01:46:19,910
Ditto, why are you here?

1681
01:46:20,210 --> 01:46:22,690
I don't know, but I'm by myself now here.

1682
01:46:23,370 --> 01:46:24,590
Now, this is insanity.

1683
01:46:25,010 --> 01:46:25,290
No!

1684
01:46:25,330 --> 01:46:26,670

1685
01:46:27,390 --> 01:46:28,030

1695
01:47:08,790 --> 01:47:10,990
I was with you.

1696
01:47:11,350 --> 01:47:12,790
What did you expect from me?

1697
01:47:12,990 --> 01:47:13,810
I was with you.

1698
01:47:16,850 --> 01:47:19,530
It was Verhost again.

1699
01:47:21,610 --> 01:47:22,370
Verhost!

1700
01:47:22,770 --> 01:47:23,350
Verhost!

1701
01:47:24,270 --> 01:47:25,690
Why were you not thinking?

1702
01:47:26,310 --> 01:47:28,130
You got more damage verhost?

1703
01:47:29,350 --> 01:47:29,950

01:47:51,830 --> 01:48:00,090

where's our who's raven then who's our raven we don't have

1706
01:48:00,090 --> 01:48:01,230
raven we don't We don't have the budget for that.

1707
01:48:01,230 --> 01:48:01,910
That's why we're losing.

1708
01:48:02,150 --> 01:48:04,630
We don't have the budget for that shit.

1709
01:48:05,370 --> 01:48:05,730
Right.

1710
01:48:06,770 --> 01:48:07,810
Where's your Raven?

1711
01:48:08,730 --> 01:48:11,630
Maybe if we won't scream, we would have the budget for it.

1712
01:48:15,870 --> 01:48:17,650
Hell took all the budget.

1713
01:48:19,270 --> 01:48:20,710
That's why we have a period.

1714
01:48:20,950 --> 01:48:22,850
You went to Dark Zero and took everything.

1715
01:48:23,030 --> 01:48:25,550
You took all the budget, guys.

1716
01:48:25,970 --> 01:48:26,790
Fucking asshole.

1717
01:48:28,830 --> 01:48:30,210
I can't believe it.

1718
01:48:31,190 --> 01:48:32,370
What is this fight?

1719
01:48:32,630 --> 01:48:33,590
What am I watching?

1720
01:48:33,770 --> 01:48:34,690
I don't fucking know.

1721
01:48:35,390 --> 01:48:36,310
Wait, they won that.

1722
01:48:36,690 --> 01:48:37,350
Wait, what?

1723
01:48:37,490 --> 01:48:38,270
They got dirty.

1724
01:48:38,490 --> 01:48:38,990
That's crazy.

1725
01:48:39,330 --> 01:48:42,350
Why couldn't we be the team that didn't have to fight
everybody?

1726
01:48:42,810 --> 01:48:49,030
Because we got pushed and there's sometimes in life, you get
pushed and you have to win the push.

1727
01:48:50,150 --> 01:48:52,010
And that's what the Apex is all about.

1728
01:48:52,570 --> 01:48:54,110
How come we didn't win the push?

1729
01:48:54,190 --> 01:48:55,470
We listened to you.

1730
01:48:55,670 --> 01:48:55,990
Oh, wait.

1731
01:48:56,110 --> 01:48:59,130
I don't think we need life.

1732
01:48:59,730 --> 01:49:00,530
Listen, I don't know.

1733
01:49:00,630 --> 01:49:02,130
I don't know what you want me to do.

1734
01:49:02,350 --> 01:49:04,530
I knocked one and cracked two people in that fight.

1735
01:49:04,770 --> 01:49:06,230
I really can't do more than that.

1736
01:49:06,390 --> 01:49:08,010
I got my one.

1737
01:49:08,790 --> 01:49:09,670
You didn't knock anyone.

1738
01:49:09,790 --> 01:49:10,490
There was two guys alive.

1739
01:49:10,990 --> 01:49:11,970
I got my one.

1740
01:49:12,430 --> 01:49:13,290
I helped you.

1741
01:49:13,310 --> 01:49:14,390
What did you knock yourself?

1742
01:49:14,910 --> 01:49:15,590
I covered you.

1743
01:49:16,490 --> 01:49:18,370
To get you your one.

1744
01:49:19,250 --> 01:49:19,670
Okay.

1745
01:49:19,870 --> 01:49:21,630
I knocked my one.

1746
01:49:22,110 --> 01:49:24,690
Now turn into I covered you.

1747
01:49:25,530 --> 01:49:27,850
So you can get your one.

1748
01:49:29,370 --> 01:49:30,510
I think you need.

1749
01:49:30,630 --> 01:49:33,470
We call it Bangalore, Bangalore.

1750
01:49:33,510 --> 01:49:34,170
Yeah, I agree.

1751
01:49:35,170 --> 01:49:37,870
And Waisen also are another character.

1752
01:49:38,190 --> 01:49:40,850
Okay, Doki, you're not playing Bangalore.

1753
01:49:41,610 --> 01:49:42,430
What am I playing?

1754
01:49:43,490 --> 01:49:44,090
Bangalore.

1756
01:49:45,290 --> 01:49:45,650
Nice.

1757
01:49:46,970 --> 01:49:48,170
Honestly, I agree.

1758
01:49:49,190 --> 01:49:51,490
And, yeah, sure, that's going to go so much better.

1759
01:49:52,450 --> 01:49:53,750
I'm playing Waisen.

1760
01:49:54,350 --> 01:49:55,990
Why would you play Waisen?

1761
01:49:56,690 --> 01:49:57,790
We need Bloodhound.

1762
01:49:59,090 --> 01:50:00,610
We need Bloodhound.

1763
01:50:00,630 --> 01:50:08,970

I'm going to play Pathfinder.

1771
01:51:05,630 --> 01:51:06,690
No, you're playing Wraith.

1772
01:51:07,150 --> 01:51:08,290
You need to be on Wraith.

1773
01:51:09,170 --> 01:51:10,730
No, I'm way better on Pathfinder.

1774
01:51:10,970 --> 01:51:12,230
No, but what about the portal?

1775
01:51:13,350 --> 01:51:14,390
We have Ziplines.

1776
01:51:14,790 --> 01:51:16,230
But the portals were important.

1777
01:51:16,930 --> 01:51:18,010
Yeah, but Ziplines.

1778
01:51:19,090 --> 01:51:20,130
Okay, RITL's throwing.

1779
01:51:20,510 --> 01:51:20,930

1780
01:51:22,370 --> 01:51:23,230
All right, RITL's throwing.

01:51:45,570 --> 01:51:47,230

But like a stupid person can get smarter by educating them.

01:58:59,970 --> 01:59:01,690
They say no questions are dumb.

1878

It's okay.

2330
02:32:04,730 --> 02:32:06,250
We play from here and we hold them back.

2331
02:32:06,610 --> 02:32:11,070
I can, let me know when to scan.

2332
02:32:11,090 --> 02:32:12,610
95 headshot on Newcastle.

2333
02:32:12,710 --> 02:32:14,690
They're gonna go here and they're gonna play those rocks.

2334
02:32:15,430 --> 02:32:17,450
We have to keep this rock.

2335
02:32:17,450 --> 02:32:18,370
Okay, nobody turn.

2336
02:32:19,270 --> 02:32:21,330
This is so laggy, I'm so annoyed.

2337
02:32:21,350 --> 02:32:22,330
Be careful, Owen.

2338
02:32:23,030 --> 02:32:24,930
Yeah, those guys behind us can't see us.

2339
02:32:25,790 --> 02:32:26,530
They smoke this.

2340
02:32:26,590 --> 02:32:27,090
They're going to cross now.

2341
02:32:27,250 --> 02:32:28,050
These guys are going to cross.

2342
02:32:28,410 --> 02:32:29,970
We need to scan them.

2343
02:32:30,190 --> 02:32:31,410
I have 11 seconds.

2344
02:32:31,610 --> 02:32:33,190
Scanning like this direction, like left side.

2345
02:32:34,290 --> 02:32:34,730
Seven.

2346
02:32:37,050 --> 02:32:39,370
There's a team in that cave I'm looking at.

2347
02:32:39,990 --> 02:32:40,870
I can see I know one.

2348
02:32:40,970 --> 02:32:41,370
Where are these guys?

2349
02:32:41,790 --> 02:32:42,650
Okay, they can go.

2350
02:32:42,810 --> 02:32:43,070
They crossed.

2351
02:32:43,510 --> 02:32:44,030
One guy.

2352
02:32:45,630 --> 02:32:47,430
There, there's a shot from here.

2353
02:32:48,250 --> 02:32:49,170
Oh my god.

2354
02:32:49,790 --> 02:32:50,710
They know, careful, careful.

2355
02:32:50,930 --> 02:32:51,830
They're over here on the side.

2356
02:32:51,850 --> 02:32:52,050
They're shooting from left.

2357
02:32:52,150 --> 02:32:52,790
Just play on me.

2358
02:32:52,870 --> 02:32:53,530
Oh no.

2359
02:32:53,870 --> 02:32:54,790
Oh my god.

2360
02:32:54,930 --> 02:32:55,710
They might push now.

2361
02:32:57,010 --> 02:32:58,110
They're gonna push us.

2362
02:32:58,170 --> 02:32:59,030
Okay, they're beaming me.

2363
02:32:59,130 --> 02:33:00,710
Yeah, I'm getting beam from the other side too.

2364
02:33:00,730 --> 02:33:01,170
It's not good here.

2365
02:33:01,270 --> 02:33:02,290
We can like...

2366
02:33:02,890 --> 02:33:05,090
There's just no one alive in this fucking lobby.

2367
02:33:05,290 --> 02:33:08,410
So they can just do whatever the fuck they want.

2368
02:33:09,810 --> 02:33:10,490
They're hard pushing.

2369
02:33:10,610 --> 02:33:11,050
They're hard pushing.

2370
02:33:12,050 --> 02:33:12,150
Yeah.

2371
02:33:13,790 --> 02:33:15,370
I'm lagging way too much, bro.

2372
02:33:15,430 --> 02:33:16,170
Everyone's teleporting.

2373
02:33:16,710 --> 02:33:17,450
Yes, great.

2374
02:33:17,530 --> 02:33:18,070
That's fine.

2375
02:33:18,290 --> 02:33:19,430
That's fine.

2376
02:33:21,470 --> 02:33:22,010
Okay.

2377
02:33:22,150 --> 02:33:22,970
It's just a squim.

2378
02:33:24,650 --> 02:33:26,390
You we had lagged debuff.

2379
02:33:28,310 --> 02:33:29,510
We had lag debuff.

2380
02:33:30,030 --> 02:33:33,870
I'm literally getting fucking dedost.

2381
02:33:34,090 --> 02:33:34,710
I'm getting dedost.

2382
02:33:34,970 --> 02:33:36,050
This is insane.

2383
02:33:36,710 --> 02:33:37,430
How did...

2384
02:33:37,430 --> 02:33:40,890
I was fine the entire time and then all of a sudden
everyone's teleporting.

2385
02:33:40,990 --> 02:33:41,790
How is this rigging?

2386
02:33:45,970 --> 02:33:58,730
this can't be real i think i think we need wraith okay now
we need wraith again wow i don't know i feel like i feel

2387
02:33:58,730 --> 02:34:01,270
like pathfinder just wasn't the right pick

2388
02:34:04,290 --> 02:34:11,210
so it's always the comps fault it's not is there anything
else well if we had wraith we could have portal to a safer

2389
02:34:11,210 --> 02:34:16,170
area I picked rage.

2390
02:34:16,430 --> 02:34:18,970
We're like, we had power and we could have zipped on high
ground.

2391
02:34:21,890 --> 02:34:23,890
Or if we had this, we could have done that.

2392
02:34:24,070 --> 02:34:25,250
If we made it, yeah.

2393
02:34:29,210 --> 02:34:30,570
Yeah, this is the last game.

2394
02:34:30,990 --> 02:34:31,990
Yeah, it was OG.

2395
02:34:33,030 --> 02:34:33,930
Yeah, it's six games.

2396
02:34:34,230 --> 02:34:34,690
Is it?

2397
02:34:34,830 --> 02:34:35,390
It should be.

2398
02:34:35,450 --> 02:34:36,050
It's like a squirm.

2399
02:34:36,190 --> 02:34:36,710
This is the last game.

2400
02:34:36,830 --> 02:34:37,330
This is the last game.

2401
02:34:37,590 --> 02:34:38,370
It's okay, guys.

2402
02:34:38,490 --> 02:34:42,150
We were just, we didn't show them our true strength.

2403
02:34:43,070 --> 02:34:47,830
Honestly, if I wasn't lagging right there, I would have
killed that fucking team all of us crossing i had so many

2404
02:34:47,830 --> 02:34:54,410
free shots i couldn't hit because they're teleporting what
if you all right if you like um on the tournament yeah what

2405
02:34:54,410 --> 02:35:02,130
are you like on the tournament then we're just gonna lose i
don't know what to tell you but like why don't you just fix

2406
02:35:02,130 --> 02:35:12,630
your internet but how how how would i do that if you know
how please let me know because i'm somebody's house i'm not

2407
02:35:12,630 --> 02:35:21,830
gonna what whose house am i going to go to bring your pc
over to somebody's house that has good internet no one has

2408
02:35:21,830 --> 02:35:36,750
good internet here then how do you play i don't i don't play
apex because this listen this game has the worst net code on

2409
02:35:36,750 --> 02:35:47,990
the planet that's not true like super smash that is true me
and mande literally had year in this game just because apex

2410
02:35:47,990 --> 02:35:54,890
everything else works perfectly fine but apex is a 30
permanent packet loss it's only me and mandy no one else

2411
02:35:54,890 --> 02:36:04,470
well if it's just you two and there's a whole eu market but
only you two have issues in eu versus like 80 other eu

2412
02:36:04,470 --> 02:36:13,170
players then obviously it wasn't just us a lot of people lag
in rank and like but it's like specifically it's

2413
02:36:13,170 --> 02:36:20,650
specifically Like, certain ISPs just don't work with this
game because, I don't know, fuck them, my guys.

2414
02:36:20,690 --> 02:36:22,110
Wouldn't it be the ISP's fault?

2415
02:36:24,270 --> 02:36:32,050
So, so, if I did, okay, let me tell, let me, if the ISP
works in every single fucking game, but it doesn't work in

2416
02:36:32,050 --> 02:36:35,870
one game, is it really ISP's fault or the game's fucking
bullshit as a netcode?

2417
02:36:35,870 --> 02:36:39,310
Maybe the ISP didn't update for Apex because it was too new.

2418
02:36:39,410 --> 02:36:41,510
They don't need to update for no fucking game.

2419
02:36:41,610 --> 02:36:44,910
The game needs to update its netcode for the ISPs.

2420
02:36:47,910 --> 02:36:58,150
but why how come the other isp is away because jesus christ
i don't fucking know what look like a specialist

2421
02:37:06,790 --> 02:37:15,850
it's okay guys this is just a skirm guys we will yeah and
the tournament will do so it's okay no your internet will be
